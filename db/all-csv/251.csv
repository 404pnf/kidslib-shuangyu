"吉米和绝望的女人","JIMMY AND THE DESPERATE WOMAN"
"作者：D. H. 劳伦斯","by D. H. Lawrence"
"“他在某些方面非常优秀出色，但是他确实需要一个头脑清醒的女人来照顾他。”","“He is very fine and strong somewhere, but he does need a level-headed woman to look after him.”"
"那是友善的女人们对他的评价。这让他沾沾自喜，让他飘飘然，也让他气愤不已。","That was the friendly feminine verdict upon him.It flattered him, it pleased him, it galled him."
"自从同他那十分迷人且聪明的妻子离婚之后，气愤之情就占据了他整个人。十年来，他的妻子一直按照这种方式生活着，直到最后厌倦了这个头脑清醒的保护者的角色。","Having divorced a very charming and clever wife, who had held this opinion for ten years, and at last had got tired of the level-headed protective game, his gall was uppermost."
"“我想把吉米扔到外面的世界，但是我知道这个可怜的小子肯定会转身投入到其他女人的怀里。那是他最糟糕的一面。要是他能独自坚持十分钟也好啊。但他就是做不到。此外，他身上倒是有一些杰出的东西，一些不可多得的品质。”","“I want to throw Jimmy out on the world, but I know the poor little man will go and fall on some woman’s bosom.That’s the worst of him.If he could only stand alone for ten minutes.But he can’t.At the same time, there is something fine about him, something rare.”"
"这是克拉丽莎翩然投入一个年轻的美国富翁怀里时的结论。听到吉米的名字时，这位年轻的美国富翁相当愤怒。现在克拉丽莎是他的妻子了。但有时候，她说起话来好像她还是吉米的妻子。","This had been Clarissa’s summing-up as she floated away in the arms of the rich young American.The rich young American got rather angry when Jimmy’s name was mentioned.Clarissa was now his wife.But she did sometimes talk as if she were still married to Jimmy."
"然而，吉米并不这么觉得。这条可怜虫已经变了。愤怒占据了他的心。他既生气，又苦恼不已。他完全了解克拉丽莎对他是怎样想、怎样评论的。与“偎依在女人怀抱的可怜虫”相比，那些形容他的“某种杰出的、不可多得的、出色”的字眼已经完全微不足道，至少在他的心中是这样的。","Not in Jimmy’s estimation, however.That worm had turned.Gall was uppermost.Gall and wormwood.He knew exactly what Clarissa thought—and said—about him.And the “something fine, something rare, something strong” which he was supposed to have “about him” was utterly outbalanced, in his feelings at least, by the “poor little man” nestled upon “some woman’s bosom”, which he was supposed to be."
"他对自己说：“我不是一个会偎依在某个女人怀里的可怜虫。要是我能够找到一个合适的女人，她会偎依在我的怀里。”","“I am not,” he said to himself, “a poor little man nestled upon some woman’s bosom.If I could only find the right sort of woman, she should nestle on mine.”"
"现在吉米35岁，而关于偎依与被偎依这一点，就是情感的症结和转折点所在。","Jimmy was now thirty-five, and this point, to nestle or to be nestled, was the emotional crux and turning-point."
"他设想自己能找到一个真正的女人，在她眼里他将应该是“优秀强大的”，而一刻也不能成为一个“可怜虫”。为什么找不到一个纯真的、没上过学的女孩，一个“德伯家的特斯”，一个惆怅的格雷琴，或是一个谦卑的鲁思来接受他呢？为什么没有呢？当然，这个世界上到处都是这样的人！","He imagined to himself some really womanly woman, to whom he should be only “fine and strong”, and not for one moment “the poor little man”.Why not some simple uneducated girl, some Tess of the D’Urbervilles, some wistful Gretchen, some humble Ruth gleaning an aftermath?Why not?Surely the world was full of such!"
"问题在于他从来没有遇到过这样的女孩。他遇到的都是精通世故的女人。他的确从来没有机会遇到“真正的”人。我们也几乎没有人遇到过。只有那些我们没有遇到过的人才是“真正的”人，才是纯朴、真诚、率直而无邪的灵魂。哎，我们就是遇不到那些纯朴、真诚、无邪的人！这真是一个悲剧啊！","The trouble was he never met them.He only met sophisticated women.He really never had a chance of meeting “real” people.So few of us ever do.Only the people we don’t meet are the “real” people, the simple, genuine, direct spontaneous, unspoilt souls.Ah, the simple, genuine, unspoilt people we don’t meet!What a tragedy it is!"
"因为，他们想必就在那里！在某个地方！只是我们从来没有邂逅他们。","Because, of course, they must be there!Somewhere!Only we never come across them."
"吉米的工作职务严重地妨碍到了他。这个工作让他接触到了许多人。但从没有遇到过对的那一类。从来没有那些“真正的”人：那些人纯朴、真诚、无邪等等、等等。","Jimmy was terribly handicapped by his position.It brought him into contact with so many people.Only never the right sort.Never the “real” people: the simple, genuine, unspoilt, etc., etc."
"吉米是一家一流的、颇有文化修养的、相当成功的杂志社的编辑，他那些相当有个性、直言不讳的评论文章为他带来了许多蜂拥而至的赞赏他的人。知道他长相俊美，而且能够在他愿意的时候格外地“讨人喜欢”；此外，知道他批评的方式真的非常巧妙。这样你就会明白他有多少的机会得到人们的崇拜和爱护。","He was editor of a high-class, rather high-brow, rather successful magazine, and his rather personal, very candid editorials brought him shoals, swarms, hosts of admiring acquaintances.Realise that he was handsome, and could be extraordinarily “nice”, when he liked, and was really very clever, in his own critical way, and you see how many chances he had of being adored and protected."
"先说说他那俊美的长相：他的脸部轮廓秀美而清晰，如农牧神在未笑、愠怒时又略带笑意的脸。双颊的轮廓修长而明晰，下巴坚毅而有力，鼻子微隆而饱满，漂亮的深灰色的眼睛闪动着长长的睫毛，眉毛浓密而乌黑。在他嘲弄别人的时候，他显得最为自我。那完全是一张彼得·潘的脸：浓密而乌黑的眉毛直直地竖立着，灰色的眼睛露出讥讽而好色的神情，鼻子和嘴微微撅起，带着些许嘲讽。这简直就是一个花容月貌、皮肤光滑的森林之神萨梯(此神具人形而有羊的尾、耳、角等，性嗜嬉戏，好色)。那是吉米最好的状态。在他的男性朋友们看来，事实就是这样。","In the first place his good looks: the fine, clean lines of his face, like the face of the laughing faun in one of the faun’s unlaughing, moody moments.The long, clean lines of the cheeks, the strong chin and the slightly arched, full nose, the beautiful dark-grey eyes with long lashes, and the thick black brows.In his mocking moments, when he seemed most himself, it was a pure Pan face, with thick black eyebrows cocked up, and grey eyes with a sardonic goaty gleam, and nose and mouth curling with satire.A good-looking, smooth-skinned satyr.That was Jimmy at his best.In the opinion of his men friends."
"但在他自己看来，他是有几分像殉道者圣塞巴斯蒂安（罗马军官，早期基督教徒，引导许多士兵信奉基督教，事发后，皇帝命令以乱箭射之，侥幸不死，后被乱棒打死）的。他被这个邪恶的世界射了一箭又一箭——痛苦之母对他来说算不了什么——他数着一滴滴留下的鲜血——如果他还能够继续数下去。有时候，比如当克拉丽莎说她真的要和那个年轻的美国富翁离开了，她是不是该和吉米离婚或者吉米是否要和她离婚？此时，一支又一支的箭就会射向他，像一群星椋鸟径直地向他飞来、对他猛戳，殉难者般的血液不断地溅落，他数也数不清。","In his own opinion, he was a sort of Martyred Saint Sebastian, at whom the wicked world shot arrow after arrow—Mater Dolorosa nothing to him—and he counted the drops of blood as they fell: when he could keep count.Sometimes—as for instance when Clarissa said she was really departing with the rich young American, and should she divorce Jimmy, or was Jimmy going to divorce her?—then the arrows assailed him like a flight of starlings flying straight at him, jabbing at him, and the drops of martyred blood simply spattered down, he couldn’t keep count."
"因此，自然而然地，他和克拉丽莎离婚了。","So, naturally, he divorced Clarissa."
"在他男性朋友们看来，他是，或者应该是，一个一贯咧嘴而笑的农牧神、森林之神，或者像彼得·潘一样的人。然而在他看来，他是一个殉道圣徒塞巴斯蒂安，同时拥有柏拉图的思想。他的女性朋友们则觉得他是一个迷人的小伙子，称赞他对生活有着深刻的见解，且有能力真正理解女人，并把每个女人捧得像个女王，这当然是指他让每个女人感到了真实的自我……","In the opinion of his men friends, he was, or should be, a consistently grinning faun, satyr, or Pan-person.In his own opinion, he was a Martyred Saint Sebastian with the mind of Plato.In the opinion of his woman friends, he was a fascinating little man with a profound understanding of life and the capacity really to understand a woman and to make a woman feel a queen; which of course was to make a woman feel her real self..."
"自然而然地，他可能拥有多姿多彩并令人瞩目的婚姻，特别是在他离婚之后。可他没有这样。原因在于，私底下，他决定再也不让任何女人觉得自己是女王了。该是轮到那些女人把他尊为国王的时候了。","He might, naturally, have made rich and resounding marriages, especially after the divorce.He didn’t.The reason was, secretly, his resolve never to make any woman feel a queen any more.It was the turn of the women to make him feel a king."
"对于某位无邪、纯真、狂野的女人而言，他将是拥有所罗门那样的智慧、美丽与财富的人。她需要生活清贫才能仰慕他的财富。这笔财富包括足够多的一笔钱：三千英镑，以及一小栋位于汉普郡的用来度过周末的别墅。并且想要纯真的话，她必须得是平民出身。这是肯定的。","Some unspoilt, unsophisticated, wild-blooded woman, to whom he would be a sort of Solomon of wisdom, beauty, and wealth.She would need to be in reduced circumstances to appreciate his wealth, which amounted to the noble sum of three thousand pounds and a little week-ending cottage in Hampshire.And to be unsophisticated she would have to be a woman of the people.Absolutely."
"同时，她不仅仅是一个“身份不明、庸俗而头脑简单的人”。","At the same time, not just the “obscure vulgar simplican”."
"他收到了很多信，多得数不清，信里附入了诗歌、小说、文章以及许多私人的倾诉。他阅读这些所有的东西，犹如一个一本正经的秃鼻乌鸦在垃圾堆里匆匆地啄食或扒找食物。","He received many letters, many, many, many, enclosing poems, stories, articles, or more personal unbosomings.He read them all: like a solemn rook pecking and scratching among the litter."
"而其中一个——不是一封信，而是来信的人——也许正是他要找的人——伊米莉亚·皮尼格太太，她是从约克郡的一个矿山村写来的。遗憾的是，她已经结婚了。","And one—not one letter, but one correspondent—might be the one—Mrs. Emilia Pinnegar, who wrote from a mining village in Yorkshire.She was, of course, unhappily married."
"吉米总是觉得这些北方阴暗的、有些可怕的矿山村有一种神秘感。他自己几乎没有涉足过牛津的北部。他认为在北方的这些矿工绝对是真正的汉子。当然，皮尼格是一个名字！还有伊米莉亚！","Now Jimmy had always had a mysterious feeling about these dark and rather dreadful mining villages in the north.He himself had scarcely set foot north of Oxford.He felt that these miners up there must be the real stuff.And Pinnegar was a name, surely!And Emilia!"
"她写了一首诗，并附上了一小段简短的注释：如果《评论家》的编辑认为这段注释没有什么价值的话，他可以直接将其删掉。作为《评论家》的编辑，吉米认为这一段相当出色并钦佩其注释的简练。但他还在犹豫要不要出版这首诗。他写了回信，想知道皮尼格太太是否还有其他可投稿的文章。","She wrote a poem, with a brief little note, that, if the editor of the Commentator thought the verses of no value, would he simply destroy them.Jimmy, as editor of the Commentator, thought the verses quite good and admired the brevity of the note.But he wasn’t sure about printing the poem.He wrote back, Had Mrs. Pinnegar nothing else to submit?"
"接着，他收到了回信。应他的要求，皮尼格太太进行了如下详尽的回答：","Then followed a correspondence.And at length, upon request, this from Mrs. Pinnegar:"
"“您询问关于我的情况，但是我应该说什么呢？我是一个31岁的女人，有一个孩子，是一个八岁的小女孩。我嫁给了一个和我生活在同一间屋子的男人，但他却常去另一个女人那里。我试着写诗，如果这可以叫做诗歌的话，因为我根本找不到其他的方式来抒发我的情感。只要能免使自己患上癌症或者其他女人容易染上的疾病，即使这对任何其他人都无关紧要，我还是觉得必须要抒发自己的感情。我在结婚之前是一个学校的老师，毕业于罗瑟勒姆学院。如果可以的话，我希望可以再去教书，自已一个人生活。但是已婚的教师再也找不到工作了，她们是不被允许的。”","“You ask me about myself, but what shall I say?I am a woman of thirty-one, with one child, a girl of eight, and I am married to a man who lives in the same house with me, but goes to another woman.I try to write poetry, if it is poetry, because I have no other way of expressing myself at all, and even if it doesn’t matter to anybody besides myself, I feel I must and will express myself, if only to save myself from developing cancer or some disease that women have.I was a school-teacher before I was married, and I got my certificates at Rotherham College.If I could, I would teach again, and live alone.But married teachers can’t get jobs any more, they aren’t allowed—”"

"吾嫁于他，心当知之。","I married him and I should know."
"大地之母从煤之心脏","The mother earth from bowels of coal"
"携之而来，受尘世之苦难。","Brought him forth for the overhead woe."
"这就是那首让《评论家》的编辑踌躇的诗。同时，他觉得，皮尼格太太听起来并不像那些纯真、质朴而粗鄙的家庭妇女。吸引他的是女人心中某种绝望与悲惨的东西。","This was the poem that the editor of the Commentator hesitated about.He reflected, also, that Mrs. Pinnegar didn’t sound like one of the nestling, unsophisticated rustic type.It was something else that still attracted him: something desperate in a woman, something tragic."
"至未来","THE NEXT EVENT"

"在煤一般的黑暗中结束了。有机会我将活下去；","Of darkness like coal. I live if I can;"
"若没有，那么我将直面即将到来的一切。","If I can’t, then I welcome whatever comes."
"这首诗听起来如此地绝望，《评论家》的编辑决定将它出版，并且，除此以外，还想见见这位女作家。他写信问道，如果他碰巧去她居住的地区，她是否介意见见他。他要去设菲尔德作讲座。她回答道，当然可以。","This poem sounded so splendidly desperate, the editor of the Commentator decided to print it, and, moreover, to see the authoress.He wrote, Would she care to see him, if he happened to be in her neighbourhood?He was going to lecture in Sheffield.She replied, Certainly."
"那天下午，他的讲座题目是“书中的人和生活中的人”。当然，先谈的是书中的人。随后他搭乘了一列火车去矿山村，那是皮尼格一家居住的地方。","He gave his afternoon lecture, on Men in Books and Men in Life.Naturally, men in books came first.Then he caught a train to reach the mining village where the Pinnegars lived."
"那是二月，地上铺满了烦人的片片雪泥。当他到达米尔谷的时候，天已经黑了，那是一种阴霾肿胀的黑暗，充满了威胁。在那里，人们说着一种古怪的方言，像幽灵一样从身边走过，拖着沉重的步子，散发出一种地下煤矿特有的气味。这里既怪异，又有些恐怖。","It was February, with gruesome patches of snow.It was dark when he arrived at Mill Valley, a sort of thick, turgid darkness full of menace, where men speaking in a weird accent went past like ghosts, dragging their heavy feet and emitting the weird scent of the coal-mine underworld.Weird and a bit gruesome it was."
"他知道他必须往山上走，直到那里的小集市。他边走边回头看，只见那漆黑的山谷里有点点灯光，对他来说就像魔鬼的营地。那硫磺和煤炭魔鬼般的气味弥漫在空气中，弥漫在阴沉沉的、意蕴驳杂和冷湿的黑暗中。","He knew he had to walk uphill to the little marketplace.As he went, he looked back and saw the black valleys with bunches of light, like camps of demons it seemed to him.And the demonish smell of sulphur and coal in the air, in the heavy, pregnant, clammy darkness."
"这些气味将他引到了新伦敦巷，然后他沿着另外一座小山丘往下走。他的皮肤上起了一阵鸡皮疙瘩。这个地方让人感到害怕、不友善、冷酷无情，就像铁和矿石注入了这黑暗的空气之中。感谢老天，他看得不太清楚，也不怎么能被看见。当他不得不问路的时候，人们对待他的方式生硬得就像把半块砖头扔到了他身上。","They directed him to New London Lane, and down he went down another hill.His skin crept a little.The place felt uncanny and hostile, hard, as if iron and minerals breathed into the black air.Thank goodness he couldn’t see much, or be seen.When he had to ask his way the people treated him in a “heave-half-a-brick-at-him” fashion."
"在经过十分疲乏的步行和问路之后，他拐进了一条林荫小巷。寒冷的二月，冰雪还未融化，路非常泥泞。矿井显然就在这个小镇的边缘，在被泥浆覆盖的某处郊外。透过树林，他能够看见那明亮的煤山上的点点红灯，同时闻到了硫磺的味道。他感觉自己就像一个现代的尤利西斯游走在赫卡忒的国度里。作为一个在矿井和工厂中生活的现代奥德赛，他比任何一个塞壬、斯库拉或者卡律布狄斯都来得更郁闷，更糟糕。","After much weary walking and asking, he entered a lane between trees, in the cold slushy mud of the unfrozen February.The mines, apparently, were on the outskirts of the town, in some mud-sunk country.He could see the red, sore fires of the burning pit-hill through the trees, and he smelt the sulphur.He felt like some modern Ulysses wandering in the realms of Hecate.How much more dismal and horrible, a modern Odyssey among mines and factories, than any Sirens, Scyllas or Charybdises."
"所以他边沉思，边走过黑巷子里冰凉的黑泥，穿过黑树林。那黑树林呜咽着，夹杂着煤矿间或发出的嘶嘶声和嘎嚓响声。这一切都被黑暗的天空所笼罩着，甚至连煤矿里电灯的光都要被黑暗所扑灭。这个地方仿佛是一个无人居住的、冷清的、黑暗的丛林。","So he mused to himself as he waded through icy black mud, in a black lane, under black trees that moaned an accompaniment to the sound of the coal-mine’s occasional hissing and chuffing, under a black sky that quenched even the electric sparkle of the colliery.And the place seemed unhabitated like a cold black jungle."
"终于，他来到了一个闪烁着微光的地方。这里显然有人居住。是的。一条新建的小街，有一盏街灯，但显然所有的房子都是黑漆漆的。他停住了。一阵凄凉感袭来。这时，来了三个小孩。","At last he came in sight of a glimmer.Apparently, there were dwellings.Yes, a new little street, with one street-lamp, and the houses all apparently dark.He paused.Absolute desertion.Then three children."
"他们告诉他要去的那栋房子的方向，他便沿着一条黑乎乎的通道踉踉跄跄地往上走。在小小的后院里面有灯光。他敲敲门，心里有点不安。一个颇为高挑的女人，站在上面的台阶上俯视着他，一副“你是谁”的表情。","They told him the house, and he stumbled up a dark passage.There was light on the little backyard.He knocked, in some trepidation.A rather tall woman, looking down at him with a “Who are you?” look, from the step above."
"“皮尼格太太吗？”","“Mrs. Pinnegar?”"
"“噢，是你吗，弗里思先生？请进。”","“Oh, is it you, Mr. Frith?Come in.”"
"他跌跌撞撞地走上了台阶，走进灯光耀眼的厨房。皮尼格太太站在那儿，她是一个高挑的女人，脸上带着一种好像被激怒的表情，冷冷地看着他。瞬间，他感觉到了自己的寒酸和渺小。他局促地伸出了他的手。","He stumbled up the step into the glaring light of the kitchen.There stood Mrs. Pinnegar, a tall woman with a face like a mask of passive anger, looking at him coldly.Immediately he felt his own shabbiness and smallness.In utter confusion, he stuck out his hand."
"“为了到这儿来，我经历了一段非常糟糕的时光。”他说道，“我怕会把你的房子弄得乱七八糟。”他低头看看自己的靴子。","“I had an awful time getting here,” he said.“I’m afraid I shall make a frightful mess of your house.”He looked down at his boots."
"“没关系。”她说。“您喝过茶了吗？”","“That’s all right,” she said.“Have you had your tea?”"
"“没有，不过不用麻烦了。”","“No—but don’t you bother about me.”"
"屋里有个金发的小女孩，额头上留着一排刘海，刘海下面闪烁着一双困惑的蓝眼睛，怀里抱着两个洋娃娃。他感觉轻松了些。","There was a little girl with fair hair in a fringe over her forehead, troubled blue eyes under the fringe, and two dolls.He felt easier."
"“这是你的女儿吗？”他问道。“她真漂亮。她叫什么名字？”","“Is this your little girl?” he asked.“She’s awfully nice.What is her name?”"
"“简。”","“Jane.”"
"“你好，简！”他说道。然而这孩子只是盯着他看，那对眼睛流露出困惑、让人难以捉摸、痛苦的神情，看来这孩子父母的感情肯定不是很好。","“How are you, Jane?” he said.But the child only stared at him with the baffled, bewildered, pained eyes of a child who lives with hostile parents."
"皮尼格太太为他摆好茶、黄油面包、果酱和面包卷。接着她坐在了他的对面。她很清秀，眉毛又黑又直，灰色的眼睛中有一对黄色的瞳仁，她习惯直视着人，似乎她惯于克制自己。她的双眸是她最漂亮的部分。眼睛里流露出了友善，并融合了女性不屈不挠、坚韧不拔的意志力，像灰色眼睛里那黄色的瞳仁一样。她的嘴和鼻子都很笔挺，仿佛是希腊面具，表情僵硬。她立刻留给他一个这样的印象：一个知道自己犯了错，但是决不会去弥补，现在也无法弥补的女人。","Mrs. Pinnegar set his tea, bread and butter, jam, and buns.Then she sat opposite him.She was handsome, dark straight brows and grey eyes with yellow grains in them, and a way of looking straight at you as if she were used to holding her own.Her eyes were the nicest part of her.They had a certain kindliness, mingled, like the yellow grains among the grey, with a relentless, unyielding feminine will.Her nose and mouth were straight, like a Greek mask, and the expression was fixed.She gave him at once the impression of a woman who has made a mistake, who knows it, but who will not change: who cannot now change."
"他感到心神不定。和她相比，他是如此地矮小和拖沓，他意识到了自己外表的渺小。而她一句话也没有说，只是在他喝茶的时候低头看着他，脸上带着那不变的表情，那是一副正在与男人和命运抗争的女人的表情。这时，厨房角落里的那个金色头发、抱着洋娃娃的小女孩，也用她那炽烈的蓝眼睛默默地注视着他。","He felt very uneasy.Being a rather small, shambling man, she made him aware of his physical inconspicuousness.And she said not a word, only looked down on him, as he drank his tea, with that changeless look of a woman who is holding her own against Man and Fate.While, from the corner across the kitchen, the little girl with her fair hair and her dolls, watched him also in absolute silence, from her hot blue eyes."
"“这里似乎是一个相当糟糕的地方。”他对她说。","“This seems a pretty awful place,” he said to her."
"“是的。十分糟糕。”女人说。","“It is.It’s absolutely awful,” the woman said."
"“你应该逃离这个地方。”他说道。","“You ought to get away from it,” he said."
"然而她用死一般的沉默来回答他的话。","But she received this in dead silence."
"想要在这个谈话中取得任何的进展都是极为困难的。他问起了皮尼格先生。她看了一下钟。","It was exceedingly difficult to make any headway.He asked about Mr. Pinnegar.She glanced at the clock."
"“他9点钟从矿井里上来。”她回答道。","“He comes up at nine,” she said."
"“他在矿井下面吗？”","“Is he down the mine?”"
"“是的。他上中班。”","“Yes.He’s on the afternoon shift.”"
"小女孩没有发出任何的声音。","There was never a sound from the little girl."
"“简总是不说话吗？”他问道。","“Doesn’t Jane ever talk?” he asked."
"“说得不多。”她妈妈说道，并环视四周。","“Not much,” said her mother, glancing round."
"他大致谈论了一下自己的讲座、设菲尔德和伦敦。但女人并不真的感兴趣。她坐在那儿，相当冷淡、寡言，并用那好奇而倔强的眼神看着他。对他来说，她就像是一个已经复仇的女人，被搁浅在了暗礁上，这是她彻底毁灭敌人的地方。她仍然冷酷、没有遗憾、顽强不屈，似乎对自己报复的内容以及报复的目的全然不知。","He talked a little about his lectures, about Sheffield, about London.But she was not really interested.She sat there rather distant, very laconic, looking at him with those curious unyielding eyes.She looked to him like a woman who has had her revenge, and is left stranded on the reefs where she wrecked her opponent.Still unrelenting, unregretting, unyielding, she seemed rather undecided as to what her revenge had been, and what it had all been about."
"“你应该逃离这个地方。”他对女人说。","“You ought to get away from here,” he said to her."
"“去哪儿呢？”她问道。","“Where to?” she asked."
"“噢。”他摆了一个含糊的手势——“任何地方都可以，只要是远离这里。”","“Oh”—he made a vague gesture—“anywhere, so long as it is quite away.”"
"她皱起眉毛，好像在思考这件事情。","She seemed to ponder this, under her portentous brow."
"“我并不明白这会有什么区别。”她说道。然后，她上下打量了下她的孩子，说：“我并不明白这有什么区别，除非完全从这个世界上消失。但是我还要顾及她呢。”她猛然把头转向孩子的方向。","“I don’t see what difference it would make,” she said.Then glancing round at her child: “I don’t see what difference anything would make, except getting out of the world altogether.But there’s her to consider.”And she jerked her head in the direction of the child."
"吉米明显地感到害怕。他不习惯这种冷酷。同时，他又感到兴奋。这个清秀、寡言的女人，有一头柔软的棕色头发，双眼中坚定不拔的神情和金色的瞳仁似乎在向他挑战，让他不得不做点什么。在她那金色瞳仁的眼睛流露出的善良里，有一丝挑战的意味。她至少还有一颗心。然而，这颗心遭遇过什么呢？为什么会发生这样的事情呢？","Jimmy felt definitely frightened.He wasn’t used to this sort of grimness.At the same time he was excited.This handsome, laconic woman, with her soft brown hair and her unflinching eyes with their gold flecks, seemed to be challenging him to something.There was a touch of challenge in her remaining gold-flecked kindness.Somewhere, she had a heart.But what had happened to it?And why?"
"她到底出了什么问题？她肯定以某种方式违背了自己的原则。","What had gone wrong with her?In some way, she must have gone against herself."
"“为什么你不过来和我一块儿住？”他说道，如同一个小小的赌徒。","“Why don’t you come and live with me?” he said, like the little gambler he was."
"他脸上带着怪异且矛盾的微笑。他像一个赌徒一样，接受了她的挑战。赌博的感觉让他激动不已，在这场赌博中，他不可能完全惨败。同时，他害怕她，并决定克服掉他的恐惧。","The queer, conflicting smile was on his face.He had taken up her challenge, like a gambler.The very sense of a gamble, in which he could not lose desperately, excited him.At the same time, he was scared of her, and determined to get beyond his scare."
"她坐在那里，打量着他，那漂亮的嘴角泛起一丝冷冷的微笑。","She sat and watched him, with the faintest touch of a grim smile on her handsome mouth."
"“你什么意思，和你住？”她说道。","“How do you mean, live with you?” she said."
"“噢——就是这句话通常的意思。”他说着，脸上带着一丝不自然的笑。","“Oh—I mean what it usually means,” he said, with a little puff of self-conscious laughter."
"“在这里，你显然不幸福。很明显，你完全生活在一个不适合的环境中。你显然不只是一个普通的女人。好吧，那么，离开吧。当我说，来和我一起生活的时候，我就是说的那个意思。如果你愿意，成为我的妻子，来伦敦和我生活在一起吧。而且，你离婚之后，如果我们想要结婚的话，我们可以结婚。”","“You’re evidently not happy here.You’re evidently in the wrong circumstances altogether.You’re obviously not just an ordinary woman.Well, then, break away.When I say, Come and live with me, I mean just what I say.Come to London and live with me, as my wife, if you like, and then if we want to marry, when you get a divorce, why, we can do it.”"
"吉米与其说是在和这个女人说话，还不如说是在同自己说。他就是那样。他弄明白了自己心中所有的想法，好像这只是他自己内心的问题罢了。当他说这些话的时候，他的表情非常地奇怪：斜着左眼、轻轻地摇着头、把他的眼睛往里面翻，就像一个完全在自言自语的人，","Jimmy made this speech more to himself than to the woman.That was how he was.He worked out all his things inside himself, as if it were all merely an interior problem of his own.And while he did so, he had an odd way of squinting his left eye and wagging his head loosely, like a man talking absolutely to himself, and turning his eyes inwards."
"女人带着些许疑惑望着他。这是她不常有的表情。他那非同寻常的举动和如此直接的建议，把她从自己紧绷的漠然中唤醒。","The woman watched him in a sort of wonder.This was something she was not used to.His extraordinary manner, and his extraordinary bald proposition, roused her from her own tense apathy."
"“那么！”她说道，“我得好好考虑一下。她怎么办呢？”——她的头再次猛地转向角落里那位睁圆了双眼的小孩。简坐着，脸上没有任何表情，她那红红的小嘴微微张开着。她似乎稍微有点恍惚，看起来她像一个大人那样能明白，却又像一个孩子那样无意识地坐在那儿发呆。","“Well!” she said.“That’s got to be thought about.What about her?”—and again she jerked her head towards the round-eyed child in the corner.Jane sat with a completely expressionless face, her little red mouth fallen a little open.She seemed in a sort of trance: as if she understood like a grown-up person, but, as a child, sat in a trance, unconscious."
"坐在椅子上的母亲转过身来，盯着自己的孩子。小女孩用一双渴望、焦虑而几近内疚的蓝色眼睛回望着她母亲。她一句话也不说。然而，她们仿佛交流着许多的东西。","The mother wheeled round in her chair and stared at her child.The little girl stared back at her mother, with hot, troubled, almost guilty blue eyes.And neither said a word.Yet they seemed to exchange worlds of meaning."
"“呃，当然。”吉米边说，边再次扭扭头。“她也要来啊。”","“Why, of course,” said Jimmy, twisting his head again; “she’d come, too.”"
"这个女人最后望了望她的孩子，然后转向他，开始慢慢地直视着他。","The woman gave a last look at her child, then turned to him, and started watching him with that slow, straight stare."
"“这不是——”他开始结结巴巴地说——“这对我来说，不是突然而未加思索的念头。我已经考虑这个问题有很长一段时间了——从我读了你的第一首诗和你的信开始。”","“It’s not”—he began, stuttering—“it’s not anything sudden and unconsidered on my part.I’ve been considering it for quite a long time—ever since I had the first poem, and your letter.”"
"他说起话来眼睛仍旧往里翻，自言自语。这个女人从容地望着他。","He spoke still with his eyes turned inwards, talking to himself.And the woman watched him unflinchingly."
"“在你还没看到我之前？”她带着一丝奇怪的讽刺问道。","“Before you ever saw me?” she asked, with a queer irony."
"“噢，那是当然。当然是在我见到你以前。要不然，我绝对不会来见你。从最开始，我就有一种肯定的感觉——”","“Oh, of course.Of course before I ever saw you.Or else I never should have seen you.From the very first, I had a definite feeling—”"
"他像一个醉汉一样猛然做了个奇怪的手势，说话的方式也像一个醉汉，他的眼睛仍然往里翻，仍然自言自语。这个女人只是一个进入他意识的幽灵，而他现在正在同他意识中的她说话。","He made odd, sharp gestures, like a drunken man, and he spoke like a drunken man, his eyes turned inward, talking to himself.The woman was no more than a ghost moving inside his own consciousness, and he was addressing her there."
"但是，现实中的女人在他意识之外坐着，略带疑惑地观望着。对她来说，这真是新鲜事。","The actual woman sat outside looking on in a sort of wonder.This was really something new to her."
"“而现在你见到我了，你真的想让我去伦敦吗？”","“And now you see me, do you want me, really, to come to London?”"
"她用略带怀疑的含混语气说道。对她来说，这件事只是有点荒谬而已。但是为什么不呢？要是能把她从生活的坟墓中拽出来，是有一点不可思议。","She spoke in a dull tone of incredulity.The thing was just a little preposterous to her.But why not?It would have to be something a little preposterous, to get her out of the tomb she was in."
"“当然，我愿意！”他又抓了一下自己的头和自己的手，大声说道。“现在我确实想让你和我一块儿生活，现在我已经真真实实地见到你了。”他还是没有正视她。他的眼睛仍然往里翻着。他仍然在自言自语，带着几分醉意。","“Of course I do!” he cried, with another scoop of his head and scoop of his hand.“Now I do actually want you, now I actually see you.”He never looked at her.His eyes were still turned in.He was still talking to himself, in a sort of drunkenness with himself."
"对她来说，这是某种特别的东西。但是这东西把她从漠然中唤醒了。","To her, it was something extraordinary.But it roused her from apathy."
"他突然意识到，远处角落里那双颊绯红的小女孩正用那双渴望的蓝眼睛盯着他。他便有点古怪地傻笑了几声。","He became aware of the hot blue eyes of the hot-cheeked little girl fixed upon him from the distant corner.And he gave a queer little giggle."
"他说：“哎呀，能够有你和简和我一块儿生活是我不敢奢望的事情！呃，这对我来说就意味着真正的生活。”他用一种怪异而紧张的声音说着，略显激动。他第一次仰起头端详这个女人，而且，显然是直勾勾地看着她。但是，即便他似乎在直勾勾地盯着她，眼中充满好奇的时候，他也只是看着自己，看着意识中自己的影子。","“Why, it’s more than I could ever have hoped for,” he said, “to have you and Jane to live with me!Why, it will mean life to me.”He spoke in an odd, strained voice, slightly delirious.And for the first time he looked up at the woman and, apparently, straight at her.But, even as he seemed to look straight at her, the curious cast was in his eye, and he was only looking at himself, inside himself, at the shadows inside his own consciousness."
"“你希望我什么时候去？”她问着，语气相当地冷淡。","“And when would you like me to come?” she asked, rather coldly."
"“呃，尽快吧。如果你愿意，明天和我一块儿回去吧。我在圣约翰伍德有一栋小房子等着你去住。明天和我一块儿去吧。那再简单不过了。”","“Why, as soon as possible.Come back with me tomorrow, if you will.I’ve got a little house in St John’s Wood, waiting for you.Come with me tomorrow.That’s the simplest.”"
"他低着头坐着的时候，她注视了他好一阵子。他像一个醉汉一样，陶醉在自我的世界里。他的头顶正在变秃，他那颇为卷曲的黑头发稀稀拉拉。","She watched him for some time, as he sat with ducked head.He looked like a man who is drunk—drunk with himself.He was going bald at the crown, his rather curly black hair was thin."
"“我明天不能去，我需要几天时间。”她说道。","“I couldn’t come tomorrow, I should need a few days,” she said."
"她想要再看看他的脸。好像她不能记清楚他的脸是什么样，这个不知从哪儿冒出来的陌生男人提出一个如此奇怪的建议。","She wanted to see his face again.It was as if she could not remember what his face was like, this strange man who had appeared out of nowhere, with such a strange proposition."
"他仰起脸，他的双眼仍然往内翻着，如瞎了一般。他现在看起来倒像一个瞎了眼的靡菲斯特（欧洲中世纪关于浮士德的传说中最主要的恶魔）。他那黑色的眉毛高高扬起，靡菲斯特啊，瞎了眼的靡菲斯特在街上乞讨着。","He lifted his face, his eyes still cast in that inturned, blind look.He looked now like a Mephistopheles who has gone blind.With his black brows cocked up, Mephistopheles, Mephistopheles blind and begging in the street."
"“哎哟，当然对我来说发生这样的事情真是太妙了。”他边说，边奇怪地撅着嘴唇强调着。“我完蛋了，彻底地完蛋了。我同克拉丽莎在一块儿的时候就已经完蛋了。但是在她离开之后，我就彻底完蛋了。我认为在这个世界上我已经再也没有机会了。对我来说发生这样的事情——我遇见了你——太不可思议了——”他茫然地扬起脸，“还有简——简——哎哟！她真是好得让人难以相信这是真的！”他歇斯底里地大笑着。“她确实很好。”","“Why, of course it’s wonderful that it’s happened like this for me,” he said, with odd pouting emphasis, pushing out his lips.“I was finished, absolutely finished.I was finished while Clarissa was with me.But after she’d gone, I was absolutely finished.And I thought there was no chance for me in the world again.It seems to me perfectly marvellous that this has happened—that I’ve come across you—” he lifted his face sightlessly—“and Jane—Jane—why she’s really too good to be true.”He gave a slight hysterical laugh.“She really is.”"
"女人和简有点尴尬地看着他。","The woman, and Jane, watched him with some embarrassment."
"“我必须得和皮尼格先生在这儿作个了断。”她说道，语气冰冷，好像在思索着什么。“你想要见见他吗？”","“I shall have to settle up here, with Mr. Pinnegar,” she said, rather coldly musing.“Do you want to see him?”"
"“噢，我——”他做了个不以为然的手势说道，“我无所谓。但是如果你认为我最好见见他——呃，当然可以——”","“Oh, I—” he said, with a deprecating gesture, “I don’t care.But if you think I’d better—why, certainly—”"
"“我的确认为你最好见见他。”她说道。","“I do think you’d better,” she said."
"“很好，那么我就见见吧。你愿意我什么时间见他都可以。”","“Very well, then, I will.I’ll see him whenever you like.”"
"“他9点多就会回来。”她说。","“He comes in soon after nine,” she said."
"“行，那我到时候见见他。这样更好。但是我想我最好先去找个睡觉的地方。但愿不会太晚。”","“All right, I’ll see him then.Much better.But I suppose I’d better see about finding a place to sleep first.Better not leave it too late.”"
"“我陪你一起打听一下。”","“I’ll come with you and ask for you.”"
"“噢，你最好别去，真的。你只要告诉我往哪儿走就可以了——”","“Oh, you’d better not, really.If you tell me where to go—”"
"他用一种保护者的口吻说话：他要保护她免受闲话的困扰。让她难以理解的是他那颇为牛津式的行为举止，而不是其他东西。她对此丝毫不习惯。","He had taken on a protective tone: he was protecting her against herself and against scandal.It was his manner, his rather Oxfordy manner, more than anything else, that went beyond her.She wasn’t used to it."
"吉米出门走入了北方夜晚那深深的黑暗中，感觉到多么地可怕，但是他还是把帽子压得低到了眉毛处，有一种强烈的冒险意味。他要把这件事情进行到底。","Jimmy plunged out into the gulfing blackness of the Northern night, feeling how horrible it was, but pressing his hat on his brow in a sense of strong adventure.He was going through with it."
"女人先前建议他在面包店那里问问有没有床，但他们没床给他了。很显然，他们不喜欢他的模样。同样，在酒吧，他们摇摇头，他们不想和他有任何的瓜葛。但是，他却用一种少有的告诫式的牛津口吻说道：","At the baker’s shop, where she had suggested he should ask for a bed, they would have none of him.Absolutely they didn’t like the looks of him.At the Pub, too, they shook their heads: didn’t want to have anything to do with him.But, in a voice more expostulatingly Oxford than ever, he said:"
"“听我说，您不能让人睡在其中的某一个灌木丛下面呐。难道不能让我见见老板娘吗？”","“But look here—you can’t ask a man to sleep under one of these hedges.Can’t I see the landlady?”"
"他说服了老板娘允许让他睡在客厅那又大又软的长沙发上，旁边的炉火燃得正旺。然后，他说他将在十点钟回来，便在蒙蒙细雨中踏着烂泥，上新伦敦巷去了。","He persuaded the landlady to promise to let him sleep on the big, soft settee in the parlour, where the fire was burning brightly.Then, saying he would be back about ten, he returned through mud and drizzle up New London Lane."
"孩子已经睡了，炉火旁，深平底锅里面的东西正在沸腾。女人脸上的表情已经有所缓和。","The child was in bed, a saucepan was boiling by the fire.Already the lines had softened a little in the woman’s face."
"她在桌上摊开一张桌布。吉米默默地坐着，觉得她几乎没有意识到他的存在。毫无疑问，她正专注于她丈夫即将回来这件事。这个陌生人只是坐在沙发上等待着。他感到自己非常地紧张。而一旦他真的紧张起来，他就能够处理任何事情。","She spread a cloth on the table.Jimmy sat in silence, feeling that she was hardly aware of his presence.She was absorbed, no doubt, in the coming of her husband.The stranger merely sat on the sofa, and waited.He felt himself wound up tight.And once he was really wound up, he could go through with anything."
"他们听到矿井里九点的哨声响过。女人接着把深平底锅从火上端下来，进入了后厨房。吉米能够闻到滤土豆的味道。他坐着一丝不动。对他来说什么也不用做，什么也不用说。他戴着大大的黑框眼镜，一脸茫然，没有任何表情，紧张地等待着，看起来像某个多疑的哲学家戴着死人的面具，他能够等上几个时代，却在任何时候都不能分清楚生与死。","They heard the nine-o’clock whistle at the mine.The woman then took the saucepan from the fire and went into the scullery.Jimmy could smell the smell of potatoes being strained.He sat quite still.There was nothing for him to do or to say.He was wearing his big black-rimmed spectacles, and his face, blank and expressionless in the suspense of waiting, looked like the death-mask of some sceptical philosopher, who could wait through the ages, and who could hardly distinguish life from death at any time."
"屋门口传来一阵沉重的脚步声，接着一个男人进来了，颇像一阵风。他那黑乎乎、带有杂色斑点的脸上立着金色的胡子，一对凶狠的蓝眼睛在被煤炭染黑的眼窝里转动得只看得见眼白。","Came the heavy-shod tread up the house entry, and the man entered, rather like a blast of wind.The fair moustache stuck out from the blackish, mottled face, and the fierce blue eyes rolled their whites in the coal-blackened sockets."
"“这位是费里思先生。”埃米莉·皮尼格说道。","“This gentleman is Mr. Frith,” said Emily Pinnegar."
"吉米站了起来，略带牛津式地扭了扭，然后伸出手，说：“您好！”","Jimmy got up, with a bit of an Oxford wriggle, and held out his hand, saying: “How do you do?”"
"他那眼镜后面的灰眼睛怪异地闪着白光。","His grey eyes, behind the spectacles, had an uncanny whitish gleam."
"“我的手现在不适合握手。”矿工说道，“请坐。”“噢，没人会介意煤尘。”吉米说道，并一屁股坐到了沙发上，“它是干净的尘垢。”","“My hand’s not fit to shake hands,” said the miner.“Take a seat.”“Oh, nobody minds coal-dust,” said Jimmy, subsiding onto the sofa.“It’s clean dirt.”"
"“他们是这样说的。”皮尼格说道。","“They say so,” said Pinnegar."
"他是个中等个子的男人，精瘦但体型结实。","He was a man of medium height, thin, but energetic in build."
"皮尼格太太正打开炉子上闪闪发亮的黄铜水龙头，往桶里倒热水，炉子上放着水壶以保持平衡。皮尼格重重地坐到扶手椅上，俯身脱去他那双笨重的灰色矿工靴。他身上有股奇怪、发霉的地底下的气味。他默默地穿上拖鞋，然后起身把他的靴子拿到了后厨房。他的妻子提着一桶热水跟着他。她回来后，把一条粗糙的擦手毛巾搭在壁炉的铁挡板上。昏暗中能够听见那个男人在后厨房里清洗的声音。没有人说一句话。皮尼格太太在准备她丈夫的晚餐。","Mrs. Pinnegar was running hot water into a pail from the bright brass tap of the stove, which had a boiler to balance the oven.Pinnegar dropped heavily into a wooden armchair, and stooped to pull off his ponderous grey pit-boots.He smelled of the strange, stale underground.In silence he pulled on his slippers, then rose, taking his boots into the scullery.His wife followed with the pail of hot water.She returned and spread a coarse roller-towel on the steel fender.The man could be heard washing in the scullery, in the semi-dark.Nobody said anything.Mrs. Pinnegar attended to her husband’s dinner."
"不久，皮尼格跑进来，裸露着上半身，蹲坐到壁炉燃得正旺的红色火焰的正前方。他的头、脸、以及身子的前面全都是湿的。他的背还是灰的，没洗着。他从壁炉架上抓下了毛巾，开始粗鲁有力地擦着自己的脸和头，而他的妻子取来一个盆子和一块沾满肥皂的浴巾默默地擦洗着他的背，一直洗到腰间，腰间的裤子已经卷起来了。这个男人完全没有注意这个陌生人——清洗是矿工仪式的一个部分，此时此刻，在他们眼里谁都不存在了。当男人分开膝盖跪在壁炉前的破旧地毯上时，女人猫着腰，为丈夫洗背，她那坚强而清秀的脸上有一种奇怪的表情，一种危险而嘲弄的表情。她正在嘲笑什么东西或某个人；但是吉米不理解到底是谁或者什么东西。","After a while, Pinnegar came running in, naked to the waist, and squatted plumb in front of the big red fire, on his heels.His head and face and the front part of his body were all wet.His back was grey and unwashed.He seized the towel from the fender and began to rub his face and head with a sort of brutal vigour, while his wife brought a bowl, and with a soapy flannel silently washed his back, right down to the loins, where the trousers were rolled back.The man was entirely oblivious of the stranger—this washing was part of the collier’s ritual, and nobody existed for the moment.The woman, washing her husband’s back, stooping there as he kneeled with knees wide apart, squatting on his heels on the rag hearthrug, had a peculiar look on her strong, handsome face, a look sinister and derisive.She was deriding something or somebody; but Jimmy could not make out whom or what."
"对吉米来说，这是一次全新的体验：坐在那儿旁观一场私人的仪式——他被完全地残忍地排除在外。矿工使劲儿地擦着他那金色的短发，直到所有的头发都竖了起来。然后，他凝视着那炽热的火焰，显得心不在焉，炉火映红了他的双颊。接着，他用那粗毛巾再次使劲地擦拭着自己的胸膛和身子，好像他的身子是他正在清理的某种机器；而他的妻子，用另外一块毛巾尤为缓慢地为他擦背。","It was a new experience for him to sit completely and brutally excluded, from a personal ritual.The collier vigorously rubbed his own fair short hair, till it all stood on end, then he stared into the red-hot fire, oblivious, while the red colour burned in his cheeks.Then again he rubbed his breast and his body with the rough towel, brutally, as if his body were some machine he was cleaning, while his wife, with a peculiar slow movement, dried his back with another towel."
"她拿走了毛巾和盆子。男人已经擦干了。但他仍然把手放在膝盖上，蹲着，心不在焉地、茫然地注视着炉火。那也似乎是他每天仪式的一部分。火光让他双颊绯红，他那金色的胡子已经被擦得竖起来了。但是他那双炽热的蓝眼睛还是渴望而迷惑地盯着那通红的煤炭，而那煤炭火红的光芒映在了他的胸膛和裸露的身体上。","She took away the towel and bowl.The man was dry.He still squatted with his hands on his knees, gazing abstractedly, blankly into the fire.That, too, seemed part of his daily ritual.The colour flushed in his cheeks, his fair moustache was rubbed on end.But his hot blue eyes stared hot and vague into the red coals, while the red glare of the coal fell on his breast and naked body."
"他是一个大概35岁的男人，正当壮年，皮肤光滑，身上没有多余的脂肪。他的肌肉不算发达，但是很灵活，并充满了活力。而且，当他漫不经心地蹲坐着沐浴在炉火中时，就像一台完全成型的机器正在休息待命，那双深铁蓝色的眼睛让人捉摸不透。","He was a man of about thirty-five, in his prime, with a pure smooth skin and no fat on his body.His muscles were not large, but quick, alive with energy.And as he squatted bathing abstractedly in the glow of the fire, he seemed like some pure-moulded engine that sleeps between its motions, with incomprehensible eyes of dark iron-blue."
"他环顾四周，但总是避开沙发上的陌生人，无视此人的存在。妻子从衣柜里面拿出一叠衣物，递给壁炉前的男人，他伸出手接过，那是一双因为工作而伤痕累累的手。稀奇的是，那平滑纤细的手臂竟能长出如此硕大、粗糙、伤痕累累、却又干净的双手。","He looked round, always averting his face from the stranger on the sofa, shutting him out of consciousness.The wife took out a bundle from the dresser-cupboard, and handed it to the out-stretched, work-scarred hand of the man on the hearth.Curious, that big, horny, work-battered clean hand, at the end of the suave, thin naked arm."
"皮尼格在炉火前摊开他的衬衫和内衣，在炉火旁烤了一小会；他一副面无表情、昏昏欲睡的样子，接着，他把衣服往脑袋上一套。然后，他终于站起来了，衬衫在裤子上方晃荡着，他又一次恍恍惚惚、昏昏欲睡地无视外面的世界。男人再次走出去，进入了洗涤室，停留在了同一个衣柜那里，取出了叠好的白天穿的裤子。","Pinnegar unrolled his shirt and undervest in front of the fire, warmed them for a moment in the glow, vaguely, sleepily, then pulled them over his head.And then at last he rose, with his shirt hanging over his trousers, and in the same abstract, sleepy way, shutting the world out of his consciousness, he went out again to the scullery, pausing at the same dresser-cupboard to take out his rolled-up day trousers."
"皮尼格太太拿走了毛巾，在桌上摆好了饭菜——一个发出嘶嘶声的盛满营养丰富的洋葱炖菜的棕色炖罐、一些煮土豆和一杯茶。男人从洗涤室回来，穿上了干净的棉织法兰绒衬衣和黑色的裤子，一头金色的头发梳得整整齐齐。他拉出餐桌旁的木制扶手椅，重重地坐下去开始吃饭。","Mrs. Pinnegar took away the towels and set the dinner on the table—rich, oniony stew out of a hissing brown stew-jar, boiled potatoes, and a cup of tea.The man returned from the scullery, in his clean flannelette shirt and black trousers, his fair hair neatly brushed.He planked his wooden armchair beside the table, and sat heavily down, to eat."
"然后他看着吉米，像一个谨慎、有点敌意的男人注视着另外一个男人。","Then he looked at Jimmy, as one wary, probably hostile man looks at another."
"“据我推测，您是个外地人？”他说道。他的话语显得有点正式，甚至正式得有点夸张。","“You’re a stranger in these parts, I gather?” he said.There was something slightly formal, even a bit pompous, in his speech."
"“一个彻彻底底的外地人。”吉米回答道，轻轻地咧嘴笑了笑。","“An absolute stranger,” replied Jimmy, with a slight aside grin."
"男人在他的盘子里撒了一些芥末，瞟了一眼食物，看看自己是否喜欢。","The man dabbed some mustard on his plate, and glanced at his food to see if he would like it."
"“您是从远处来的吗？”他边问，边开始吃东西。吃东西的时候，他似乎又忘记了吉米的存在。他把头俯在盘子上方，大吃起来。但是出于本能的谨慎，他很有可能一直在琢磨着什么。","“Come from a distance, do you?” he asked, as he began to eat.As he ate, he seemed to become oblivious again of Jimmy, bent his head over his plate, and ate.But probably he was ruminating something all the time, with barbaric wariness."
"“从伦敦来。”吉米小心地回答道。","“From London,” said Jimmy, warily."
"“伦敦！”皮尼格说道，并没有把视线移开自己的盘子。","“London!” said Pinnegar, without looking from his plate."
"皮尼格太太进来坐下，像往常那样沉默着，坐在电灯下那把尾部被加固过的摇椅上。","Mrs. Pinnegar came and sat, in ritualistic silence, in her tail-backed rocking-chair under the light."
"“那么，是什么把您带到这个地方来的呢？”皮尼格边问，边搅着自己的茶。","“What brings you this way, then?” asked Pinnegar, stirring his tea."
"“噢！”吉米在沙发上略微地扭动了一下。“我来见皮尼格太太。”","“Oh!”Jimmy writhed a little on the sofa.“I came to see Mrs. Pinnegar.”"
"矿工吞了一大口茶。","The miner took a hasty gulp of tea."
"“那么，你们是熟人？”他说，还是没有看他。他侧面对着吉米坐着。","“You’re acquainted then, are you?” he said, still without looking round.He sat with his side-face to Jimmy."
"“是的，我们现在认识了。”吉米解释道，“我是今天晚上才认识皮尼格太太的。事实上，她给《评论家》寄来了一些诗——我就是编辑——而且我认为写得非常地出色，所以我回了信告诉了她我的想法。然后我觉得我想要来见见她，而她也愿意，因此我来了。”","“Yes, we are now,” explained Jimmy.“I didn’t know Mrs. Pinnegar till this evening.As a matter of fact, she sent me some poems for the Commentator—I’m the editor—and I thought they were good, so I wrote and told her so.Then I felt I wanted to come and see her, and she was willing, so I came.”"
"男人伸出手，为自己切下了一块面包，然后吞了一大口。","The man reached out, cut himself a piece of bread, and swallowed a large mouthful."
"“您认为她的诗写得不错？”他说道，最后终于转向了吉米，直视着他，带着孩子般但又挑衅的眼神。“您计划刊登在您的杂志上吗？”","“You thought her poetry was good?” he said, turning at last to Jimmy and looking straight at him, with a stare something like the child’s, but aggressive.“Are you going to put it in your magazine?”"
"“是的，我想是这样。”吉米说道。","“Yes, I think I am,” said Jimmy."
"“我只读过她的一首诗——是关于一个矿工的，她熟悉他的一切，因为她嫁给了他。”他用极其沙哑的嗓音说道，那语气中带着某种嘲弄和不屈服。","“I never read but one of her poems—something about a collier she knew all about, because she’d married him,” he said, in his peculiar harsh voice, that had a certain jeering clang in it, and a certain indomitableness."
"吉米沉默着。这个男人沙哑而挑衅的声音让他畏缩。“我个人从不喜欢《评论家》。”皮尼格说道，把他的拼盘推到了一旁，环视四周找他的布丁。“对我来说，这本杂志说了一大推东西，却没有任何结果。”","Jimmy was silent.The other man’s harsh fighting voice made him shrink.“I could never get on with the Commentator myself,” said Pinnegar, looking round for his pudding, pushing his meat-plate aside.“Seems to me to go a long way round to get nowhere.”"
"“嗯，或许是这样的。”吉米说着，有点难为情。“但是只要评论的方式有趣就行！我不相信现如今会有任何有结果的东西——当然我是说任何期刊都一样。”","“Well, probably it does,” said Jimmy, squirming a little.“But so long as the way is interesting!I don’t see that anything gets anywhere at present—certainly no periodical.”"
"“我不了解。”皮尼格说，“《解放者》里面有一些真相，而《两面神》里面也有一些思想。就我个人而言，我不明白那些家伙抒发的这些感情有什么用。它们将对你没有任何的帮助。”","“I don’t know,” said Pinnegar.“There’s some facts in the Liberator—and there’s some ideas in the Janus.I can’t see the use myself, of all these feelings folk say they have.They get you nowhere.”"
"“但是，”吉米轻笑道，“你想要达到什么样的结果呢？有结果是很好的，但是在现如今的这个世界上你想要有什么结果呢？我是说，在普遍意义上。如果你想在这个矿井里得到一个好的工作——好吧，去吧，去得到它吧。但是当你开始谈论在生活中有某种结果的时候——呃，你就得知道你正在谈论的是什么。”","“But,” said Jimmy, with a slight pouf of laughter, “where do you want to get?It’s all very well talking about getting somewhere, but where, where in the world today do you want to get?In general, I mean.If you want a better job in the mine—all right, go ahead and get it.But when you begin to talk about getting somewhere in life—why, you’ve got to know what you’re talking about.”"
"“我是一个男人，不是吗？”矿工说道，异常平静而坚定地。","“I’m a man, aren’t I?” said the miner, going very still and hard."
"“你提到你是一个男人，你什么意思？”吉米厉声说道，他真的被激怒了。“你什么意思？对，你是个男人。但是，那又怎么样呢？”","“But what do you mean, when you say you’re a man?” snarled Jimmy, really exasperated.“What do you mean?Yes, you are a man.But what about it?”"
"“难道我没有权利说我不愿意被人利用吗？”矿工缓慢、粗野并沉重地说道。","“Haven’t I the right to say I won’t be made use of?” said the collier, slow, harsh, and heavy."
"“你有权利这样说，”吉米大笑着回应道，“但是这不能说明任何问题。我们都被利用着，从乔治国王开始到现在为止。我们一直都被利用。当你吃布丁的时候，你正在利用成百上千的人——包括你的妻子。”","“You’ve got a right to say it,” retorted Jimmy, with a pouf of laughter.“But it doesn’t mean anything.We’re all made use of, from King George downwards.We have to be.When you eat your pudding you’re making use of hundreds of people—including your wife.”"
"“我知道。我知道。但是这没有任何区别。我不想被人利用。”","“I know it.I know it.It makes no difference, though.I’m not going to be made use of.”"
"吉米耸耸肩。","Jimmy shrugged his shoulders."
"“噢，好吧！”他说道。“很多人都是这么说的。”","“Oh, all right!” he said.“That’s just a phrase, like any other.”"
"矿工静静地坐在椅子上，他的脸变得僵硬且冷漠。很显然，这个男人在仔细地想着什么，那似乎是他意识里的一颗钉子。他正努力使它强硬起来，如同皮肤有时候也会因为刺入的钢刺而变得坚硬。","The miner sat very still in his chair, his face going hard and remote.He was evidently thinking over something that was stuck like a barb in his consciousness, something he was trying to harden over, as the skin sometimes hardens over a steel splinter in the flesh."
"“除了被人利用，我什么都不是。”最后他艰难地下了结论对自己说道，眼睛盯着某个地方。“在矿井下面，我被利用，他们付我少得可怜的工资。在家里，我被利用，妻子为我在桌上摆好饭菜，好像我是店里的客人。”","“I’m nothing but made use of,” he said, now talking hard and final, to himself, and staring out into space.“Down the pit, I’m made use of, and they give me a wage, such as it is.At the house, I’m made use of, and my wife sets the dinner on the table as if I was a customer in a shop.”"
"“那你指望什么呢？”吉米大声说着，并在椅子上扭来扭去。","“But what do you expect?” cried Jimmy, writhing in his chair."
"“我？我有什么指望？我什么都不指望。但让我告诉你——”他转过来，冷冷地直视着吉米的眼睛，“我什么都不能忍受，两个都是。”","“Me?What do I expect?I expect nothing.But I tell you what—” he turned, and looked straight and hard into Jimmy’s eyes—“I’m not going to put up with anything, either.”"
"吉米在这个男人的眼中看到了艰难的决定，但很快就从他眼神中移开了。","Jimmy saw the hard finality in the other man’s eyes, and squirmed away from it."
"“你是否知道你不能容忍的是什么呢——”他说道。","“If you know what you’re not going to put up with—” he said."
"“我不想让我的妻子写诗！然后寄给一群她从没见过的男人。我不想在我回家的时候看到自己的妻子像包迪西亚女王（古不列颠爱西尼人王后，夫死后，领导反罗马人的起义，战败后服毒自杀）那样坐在那儿，脸像有几个窟窿的石头墙。我不知道她怎么了。她自己也不知道。然而只要她喜欢她就做吧。但是，你听着，这对我来说毫无区别。”","“I don’t want my wife writing poetry!And sending it to a parcel of men she’s never seen.I don’t want my wife sitting like Queen Boadicea, when I come home, and a face like a stone wall with holes is it.I don’t know what’s wrong with her.She doesn’t know herself.But she does as she likes.Only, mark you, I do the same.”"
"“当然！”吉米大声说道，虽然并没有什么可以说“当然”的。","“Of course!” cried Jimmy, though there was no of course about it."
"“她已经告诉你我有另外一个女人啦？”","“She’s told you I’ve got another woman?”"
"“是的。”","“Yes.”"
"“那我要告诉你为什么。如果我向煤矿屈服，而每天要下到煤矿里干八个小时苦工的话，那么就得有人，或多或少，向我让步。”","“And I’ll tell you for why.If I give in to the coal face, and go down the mine every day to eight hours’ slavery, more or less, somebody’s got to give in to me.”"
"“那么，”吉米停了一会说，“你是说你想要你的妻子顺从于你。好吧，那就是问题所在。你必须娶一个愿意顺从你的女人。”","“Then,” said Jimmy, after a pause, “if you mean you want your wife to submit to you—well, that’s the problem.You have to marry the woman who will submit.”"
"这些话从吉米口中冒出来，着实有点令人惊讶。他坐在那儿，像一个清教徒的神父那样对着矿工演讲，完全忘记自己曾经与克拉丽莎之间破裂的感情。","It was amazing, this from Jimmy.He sat there and lectured the collier like a Puritan Father, completely forgetting the disintegrating flutter of Clarissa, in his own background."
"“我想要一个愿意取悦我，想要哄我开心的妻子。”矿工说道。","“I want a wife who’ll please me, who’ll want to please me,” said the collier."
"“为什么你就应该被讨好，而不是别人？”妻子冷冷地问道。","“Why should you be pleased, any more than anybody else?” asked the wife coldly."
"“我的孩子，我那小女孩肯定会让我开心的——如果她妈妈让她这样做的话。但是这些女人都是一伙的。我跟你说——”这时他转向吉米，深蓝色的眼睛露出一丝怒火，“我想要有个让我高兴的女人，一个渴望逗我开心的女人。但如果我在自己的家里找不到这样的女人，我就会在外面找。”","“My child, my little girl wants to please me—if her mother would let her.But the women hang together.I tell you”—and here he turned to Jimmy, with a blaze in his dark blue eyes—“I want a woman to please me, a woman who’s anxious to please me.And if I can’t find her in my own home, I’ll find her out of it.”"
"“希望她让你开心了。”妻子微微摇着椅子说道。","“I hope she pleases you,” said the wife, rocking slightly."
"“嗯，”男人说道，“她确实让我高兴。”","“Well,” said the man, “she does.”"
"“那为什么你不干脆去和她生活在一起？”她说道。","“Then why don’t you go and live with her altogether?” she said."
"他转过来，看着她。","He turned and looked at her."
"“我为什么不？”他说，“因为我有自己的家。我有自己的房子，自己的妻子，让我妻子愿意干嘛就干嘛，就是一起生活的女人罢了。并且我还有自己的孩子。为什么我要破坏掉所有的这一切呢？”","“Why don’t I?” he said.“Because I’ve got my home.I’ve got my house, I’ve got my wife, let her be what she may, as a woman to live with.And I’ve got my child.Why should I break it all up?”"
"“那我怎么办？”她问道，语气中带着冷淡与凶狠。","“And what about me?” she asked, coldly and fiercely."
"“你？你有一个家。你有一个孩子。你还有一个为你工作的男人。你拥有了你想要的所有的一切。你愿意做什么就做什么——”","“You?You’ve got a home.You’ve got a child.You’ve got a man who works for you.You’ve got what you want.You do as you like—”"
"“是吗？”她带着令人无法忍受的讽刺问道。","“Do I?” she asked, with intolerable sarcasm."
"“是的。除了一丁点家务活以外，你愿意干什么就干什么。如果你想要离开，你可以走。但是只要你还住在我的家里，你就必须尊重这个家。你不能带任何男人来这里，你明白吗？”","“Yes.Apart from the bit of work in the house, you do as you like.If you want to go, you can go.But while you live in my house, you must respect it.You bring no men here, you see.”"
"“你尊重过你自己的家吗？”她说道。","“Do you respect your home?” she said."
"“是的！我很尊重！如果我有另外一个让我高兴的女人，我不会剥夺你的任何东西。我对你所有的要求就是做好一个家庭主妇分内的事情。”","“Yes!I do!If I get another woman—who pleases me—I deprive you of nothing.All I ask of you is to do your duty as a housewife.”"
"“卑贱到给你洗背！”她猛然挖苦道；吉米觉得这话有点粗俗。","“Down to washing your back!” she said, heavily sarcastic; and, Jimmy thought, a trifle vulgar."
"“卑贱到为我洗背，因为我的背本来就该洗。”他说道。","“Down to washing my back, since it’s got to be washed,” he said."
"“那另外一个女人呢？让她做这件事啊。”","“What about the other woman?Let her do it.”"
"“这儿才是我的家。”","“This is my home.”"
"妻子像一个疯女人一样，做了一个奇怪的动作。","The wife gave a strange movement, like a mad woman."
"吉米坐在那儿，脸色苍白，有点惊呆了。在矿工平静的外表下，他感觉到那积蓄很久的冰冷的怒气和坚定的决心。他能看到男人瘦削脸上的骨骼——那是男人特有的骨骼，仿佛人类的灵魂或精神进入了这活生生的头颅与骨骼中，使其几乎刀枪不入。","Jimmy sat rather pale and frightened.Behind the collier’s quietness he felt the concentration of almost cold anger and an unchanging will.In the man’s lean face he could see the bones, the fixity of the male bones, and it was as if the human soul, or spirit, had gone into the living skull and skeleton, almost invulnerable."
"出于某种奇怪的原因，吉米感觉到对这个瘦骨嶙峋却富有逻辑的男人有一股极其强烈的愤怒。他不能忍受这个男人那种难以消除的冷酷和顽固。","Jimmy, for some strange reason, felt a wild anger against this bony and logical man.It was the hard-driven coldness, fixity, that he could not bear."
"“听着！”他用那洪亮的牛津腔调叫道，他眼镜后面的眼睛怒视着对方，同时也注视着自己的内心。“你说皮尼格太太很自由——可以自由地做任何她乐意做的事。如果是那样的话，要是她立刻和我离开，你不会反对吧？”","“Look here!” he cried, in a resonant Oxford voice, his eyes glaring and casting inwards behind his spectacles.“You say Mrs. Pinnegar is free—free to do as she pleases.In that case, you have no objection if she comes with me right away from here.”"
"矿工疑惑地注视着编辑那张苍白而陌生的脸。吉米的脸微微地避开了周围的目光，对任何人都视而不见。他险恶而狡猾地斜了斜眉毛，如殉道者塞巴斯蒂安那样紧绷着嘴。","The collier looked at the pale, strange face of the editor in wonder.Jimmy kept his face slightly averted, and sightless, seeing nobody.There was a Mephistophelian tilt about the eyebrows, and a Martyred Sebastian straightness about the mouth."
"“她愿意吗？”皮尼格问道，满心怀疑。妻子微微地、冷冷一笑。她很清楚她丈夫十分自负，完全不相信她会更喜欢其他人而不是他。","“Does she want to?” asked Pinnegar, with devastating incredulity.The wife smiled faintly, grimly.She could see the vanity of her husband in his utter inability to believe that she could prefer the other man to him."
"“那——”吉米说，“你得自己问问她了。”但是这就是我来这里的原因，来问她是否愿意去和我一块儿生活，把孩子也带上。”","“That,” said Jimmy, “you must ask her yourself.But it’s what I came here for: to ask her to come and live with me, and bring the child.”"
"“你见都没见过她就来问她那件事情？”丈夫说道，越来越疑惑。","“You came without having seen her, to ask her that?” said the husband, in growing wonder."
"“是的。”吉米激动地一边说，一边酒醉般点头强调。“是的！是在没见到她之前！”","“Yes,” said Jimmy, vehemently, nodding his head with drunken emphasis.“Yes!Without ever having seen her!”"
"“这次你用你的诗找到了一个古怪的没出息的家伙。”他说道，带着丈夫的派头，好奇地转向他妻子。她讨厌这种随随便便的丈夫派头。","“You’ve caught a funny fish this time, with your poetry,” he said, turning with curious husband-familiarity to his wife.She hated this offhand husband-familiarity."
"“那你遇到的又是哪种怪鸟呢？”她反驳道。“你用什么东西来抓到她的？”","“What sort of fish have you caught?” she retorted.“And what did you catch her with?”"
"“粘鸟贴！”他说道，微微地匆匆咧嘴一笑。","“Bird-lime!” he said, with a faint, quick grin."
"吉米焦虑地坐着。他们三个人都焦虑地坐了一会。","Jimmy was sitting in suspense.They all three sat in suspense, for some time."
"“那你对他怎么说的？”最后矿工问道。","“And what are you saying to him?” said the collier at length."
"吉米仰起头，他脸上那恶毒、似笑非笑的神情，让他再次看起来颇为帅气，如农牧神和靡菲斯特的合体。他好奇并动人地注视着远处那个正在注视他的女人。","Jimmy looked up, and the malevolent half-smile on his face made him look rather handsome again, a mixture of faun and Mephisto.He glanced curiously, invitingly, at the woman who was watching him from afar."
"“我同意了！”她用冷冷的声音答道。","“I say yes!” she replied, in a cool voice."
"丈夫变得沉默了，直挺挺地坐在他那木制的扶手椅上面，凝视着某处。好像他正在目不转睛地注视着从他的灵魂飞走的什么东西。但是他决不会对任何的感情屈服。","The husband became very still, sitting erect in his wooden armchair and staring into space.It was as if he were fixedly watching something fly away from him, out of his own soul.But he was not going to yield at all, to any emotion."
"现在，他无法相信这个女人会想要离开他。但是她确实是这样想的。","He could not now believe that this woman should want to leave him.Yet she did."
"“我肯定这都是出于好意。”吉米用他那清教徒神父的口吻说道，“你真的不介意吧，”他不自在地慢吞吞地说，“如果她带着孩子一块儿走。我保证我会尽我最大的努力让她们幸福。”","“I’m sure it’s all for the best,” said Jimmy, in his Puritan-Father voice.“You don’t mind, really”—he drawled uneasily—“if she brings the child.I give you my word I’ll do my very best for it.”"
"矿工看着他，仿佛他非常遥远。看到这样的表情，吉米害怕得全身发颤。他能明白这个男人正在无情地压抑自己内心的感情，可以说是在剥光自己，剥去自己的血肉，剥到只剩下一具男人冷硬、无情的骨骸。","The collier looked at him as if he were very far away.Jimmy quailed under the look.He could see that the other man was relentlessly killing the emotion in himself, stripping himself, as it were, of his own flesh, stripping himself to the hard unemotional bone of the human male."
"“我给她自由行动的权利。”皮尼格说道，他的嘴唇已经麻木了。“她愿意干嘛就干嘛。”","“I give her a blank cheque,” said Pinnegar, with numb lips.“She does as she pleases.”"
"“出于父亲般的疼爱，还是自私的想法呢？”她问道。","“So much for fatherly love, compared with selfishness,” she said."
"他转过来看着她，微微有点生气，那怒气带有一股莫名的力量。她立刻停止并沉默了。","He turned and looked at her with that curious power of remote anger.And immediately she became still, quenched."
"“我认为，我给了你自由。”他心不在焉地重复道。","“I give you a blank cheque, as far as I’m concerned,” he repeated abstractedly."
"“那是虚有其表的自由！”她说道，她第一次感到心酸。","“It is blank indeed!” she said, with her first touch of bitterness."
"吉米看看钟。天色越来越晚了，他有可能被关在酒吧的门外。他起身准备走，说他会在明天早上回来。他会在第二天中午的时候离开前往伦敦。","Jimmy looked at the clock.It was growing late: he might be shut out of the public-house.He rose to go, saying he would return in the morning.He was leaving the next day, at noon, for London."
"他走进了黑暗中，穿行在那黑漆漆、被夜色笼罩的土地上。他情绪颇为高涨，其中也夹杂着些许的畏惧。但另一方面他总是需要一点点畏惧，来让他高兴。他一想到那两个人一起在那间房子里面，就觉得恐怖。那是一种令人恐惧的紧张状态。他自己绝对不能忍受这样极端紧张的状态。他总是不得不妥协，成为一个满怀歉意的可怜人。他能够用那种方式对付皮尼格太太。埃米莉！他必须习惯这样叫她。埃米莉！伊米莉亚这个名字听起来有点滑稽。他从不认识叫埃米莉的人。","He plunged into the darkness and mud of that black, night-ridden country.There was a curious elation in his spirits, mingled with fear.But then he always needed an element of fear, really, to elate him.He thought with terror of those two human beings left in that house together.The frightening state of tension!He himself could never bear an extreme tension.He always had to compromise, to become apologetic and pathetic.He would be able to manage Mrs. Pinnegar that way.Emily!He must get used to saying it.Emily!The Emilia was absurd.He had never known an Emily."
"他真的感到害怕，但同时也真的感到得意洋洋。他正在做一件大事。并不是因为他爱上了这个女人。但，我的天，他试图把她从那个男人身边带走。他想让她进行一个冒险。一个完完全全关于她的冒险。他觉得真的非常高兴，非常自豪，非常有男子汉气概。","He felt really scared, and really elated.He was doing something big.It was not that he was in love with the woman.But, my God, he wanted to take her away from that man.And he wanted the adventure of her.Absolutely the adventure of her.He felt really elated, really himself, really manly."
"然而，清晨的时候，他却有些胆怯地回到了矿工的住所。又是昏暗的一天，天上下着毛毛细雨，黑色的树林、黑色的路、黑色的树篱、黑色的砖房，天空雾蒙蒙的，传来挖煤的吵杂声和煤矿的味道。这就像生活在一个可怕的地狱。","But in the morning he returned rather sheepishly to the collier’s house.It was another dark, drizzling day, with black trees, black road, black hedges, blackish brick houses, and the smell and the sound of collieries under a skyless day.Like living in some weird underground."
"他再次不情愿地走上那条通往门口的过道，敲了敲后门，望着那贫瘠的小后花园，里面种着结球甘蓝，还有难看的排污设备。","Unwillingly he went up that passage-entry again, and knocked at the back door, glancing at the miserable little back garden with its cabbage-stalks and its ugly sanitary arrangements."
"孩子为他打开门，她有着金色的头发、红扑扑的双颊和一对热切的深蓝色眼睛。","The child opened the door to him: with her fair hair, flushed cheeks, and hot, dark-blue eyes."
"“你好，简！”他说道。","“Hello, Jane!” he said."
"母亲站在餐桌旁，身材高大、强健结实。当他进屋的时候，她用那矜持的眼神注视着他。她长得很清秀，但是她的皮肤不太好，好像这场战斗损害了她的健康。吉米抬头看看她，带着他那轻柔而迷人的微笑，那通常会让他极为成功地走进一个女人的内心。当他看到她那金色瞳仁的眼睛在他眼睛里面搜寻着，没有一点善意的时候，他心里面想：“我的天，我怎么能和那个女人睡在一起！”然而，他已经有了这样的决心，所以他无论如何都要成功。","The mother stood tall and square, by the table, watching him with portentous eyes, as he entered.She was handsome, but her skin was not very good: as if the battle had been too much for her health.Jimmy glanced up at her smiling his slow, ingratiating smile, that always brought a glow of success into a woman’s spirit.And as he saw her gold-flecked eyes searching in his eyes, without a bit of kindliness, he thought to himself: “My God, however am I going to sleep with that woman!”His will was ready, however, and he would manage it somehow."
"当他看着那一动不动、骨瘦如柴的脑袋和炉火旁木质扶手椅上矿工那精瘦的身躯的时候，他更加坚定了自己的决心。他必须战胜那个男人。","And when he glanced at the motionless, bony head and lean figure of the collier seated in the wooden armchair by the fire, he was the more ready.He must triumph over that man."
"“你乘的是哪一趟火车？”皮尼格太太问道。","“What train are you going by?” asked Mrs. Pinnegar."
"“12点30分的。”当他说话的时候，他抬头看看她，睁大的双眼神采飞扬，露出孩子般的害羞表情，那是他特有的优点。她低头，几分好奇、几分疑惑地看着他。她看似已经对吉米那孩子般、闪着光亮、迷人的深灰色眼睛和长长的睫毛着迷，因为这些与他丈夫那蓝色的眼睛里面总流露出的愤怒和倔强的神情完全不同。对她来说，她的丈夫总是看起来像个讨厌鬼：瘦弱、专注、和他那永不屈服的精神。而这个男人，用他那充满青春活力的波斯猫般的眼睛看着其他人，双眼睁得大大的，神采奕奕，使人销魂，这双眼勇敢、腼腆、害羞，也不可思议地使人着迷。她立刻被它们的魔力所征服。","“By the twelve thirty.”He looked up at her as he spoke, with the wide, shining, childlike, almost coy eyes that were his peculiar asset.She looked down at him in a sort of interested wonder.She seemed almost fascinated by his childlike, shining, inviting dark-grey eyes, with their long lashes: such an absolute change from that resentful unyielding that looked out always from the back of her husband’s blue eyes.Her husband always seemed like a menace to her, in his thinness, his concentration, his eternal unyielding.And this man looked at one with the wide, shining, fascinating eyes of a young Persian kitten, something at once bold and shy and coy and strangely inviting.She fell at once under their spell."
"“您应该在离开之前吃顿饭。”她说道。","“You’ll have dinner before you go,” she said."
"“不了。”他惊慌失措地叫道，因为他极不情愿在那个男人面前吃饭。“不，我吃了一顿丰盛的早餐。我在设菲尔德转车的时候会吃一个三明治，真的！”","“No!” he cried in panic, unwilling indeed to eat before that other man.“No, I ate a fabulous breakfast.I will get a sandwich when I change in Sheffield: really!”"
"她必须出门买点东西。她说等她回来之后会陪他一同去车站。当时刚刚过了11 点。","She had to go out shopping.She said she would go out to the station with him when she got back.It was just after eleven."
"“但是，听我说，”他说着，同样也是在对那个瘦削的心不在焉的男人说，那男人若无其事地在那儿读着报纸，“我们得把这事儿定下来。”我想让皮尼格太太来和我一块儿生活，她和她的孩子。并且她也准备过来！因此，难道你不觉得，她今天和我一块儿走更好吗？只要放些必需品在包里，就能跟我走。有什么好拖的？”","“But look here,” he said, addressing also the thin abstracted man who sat unnoticing, with a newspaper, “we’ve got to get this thing settled.I want Mrs. Pinnegar to come and live with me, her and the child.And she’s coming!So don’t you think, now, it would be better if she came right along with me today!Just put a few things in a bag and come along.Why drag the thing out?”"
"“我跟你说，”丈夫回答道，“她在我面前有绝对的自由做她乐意做的事情。”","“I tell you,” replied the husband, “she has a blank cheque from me to do as she likes.”"
"“那么，好！你愿意吗？你愿意现在和我一块儿走吗？”吉米边说，边抬头直视着她，但是他的眼睛还是在往里翻着。他特意恳求她的宽恕。","“All right, then!Won’t you do that?Won’t you come along with me now?” said Jimmy, looking up at her exposedly, but casting his eyes a bit inwards.Throwing himself with deliberate impulsiveness on her mercy."
"“我不能！”她果断地说。“我今天不能去。”","“I can’t!” she said decisively.“I can’t come today.”"
"“但是为什么不呢——说真的？为什么不趁我在这里的时候一块儿走呢？你是自由的，你可以按你的意愿行事——”","“But why not—really?Why not, while I’m here?You have that blank cheque, you can do as you please—”"
"“自由并不能带给我什么。”她粗鲁地说，“不管怎么说，我今天都不能和你走。”","“The blank cheque won’t get me far,” she said rudely; “I can’t come today, anyhow.”"
"“那你什么时候可以来呢？”他用奇怪、任性的语调恳求道。“想必是越快越好。”","“When can you come, then?” he said, with that queer, petulant pleading.“The sooner the better, surely.”"
"“我可以在星期一的时候去。”她突然说道。","“I can come on Monday,” she said abruptly."
"“星期一！”他透过眼镜，略带几分惊恐地抬头凝视着她。接着他再次咬紧牙齿，点了点头。“那么，好吧！今天是星期六。那就星期一吧！”","“Monday!”He gazed up at her in a kind of panic, through his spectacles.Then he set his teeth again, and nodded his head up and down.“All right, then!Today is Saturday.Then Monday!”"
"“现在我是否可以走了？”她说道，“我还得出门办点儿事。我回来之后会陪你去车站。”","“If you’ll excuse me,” she said, “I’ve got to go out for a few things.I’ll walk to the station with you when I get back.”"
"她给简匆匆套上了一件天蓝色的小外套，并戴上了一顶童帽，自己穿上厚重的黑色外套，戴了顶黑色的帽子，便出门了。","She bundled Jane into a little sky-blue coat and bonnet, put on a heavy black coat and black hat herself, and went out."
"吉米非常不安地坐在矿工对面，矿工也戴着眼镜在读报。皮尼格放下报纸，摘下了架在鼻子上的眼镜，说了些工党政府的事情。","Jimmy sat very uneasily opposite the collier, who also wore spectacles to read.Pinnegar put down the newspaper and pulled the spectacles off his nose, saying something about a Labour Government."
"“是的。”吉米说道。“毕竟，这是最合乎常理的。如果你提倡民主，那唯一合理的事情就是选择工党政府。但是，就我个人而言，两个政府是同样让人满意的。”","“Yes,” said Jimmy.“After all, best be logical.If you are democratic, the only logical thing is a Labour Government.Though, personally, one Government is as good as another, to me.”"
"“也许是这样吧！”矿工说道。“但是有些事情总得有个了断，这是迟早的。”","“Maybe so!” said the collier.“But something’s got to come to an end, sooner or later.”"
"“噢，有很多这样的事情！”吉米说道，接着他们陷入了沉默。","“Oh, a great deal!” said Jimmy, and they lapsed into silence."
"“你以前结过婚吗？”最后皮尼格问道。","“Have you been married before?” asked Pinnegar, at length."
"“是的。我妻子和我离婚了。”","“Yes.My wife and I are divorced.”"
"“我猜你想让我同我妻子离婚？”矿工说道。","“I suppose you want me to divorce my wife?” said the collier."
"“呃——是的！那是再好不过的了——”","“Why—yes!—that would be best—”"
"“对我来说都一样——”皮尼格说道，“离或不离。我会和另外一个女人生活，但是我绝对不会再娶另外一个女人。知足者常乐。但是如果她想要离婚，她可以离。”","“It’s the same to me,” said Pinnegar; “divorce or no divorce.I’ll live with another woman, but I’ll never marry another.Enough is as good as a feast.But if she wants a divorce, she can have it.”"
"“这是最好的了。”吉米说道。","“It would certainly be best,” said Jimmy."
"有好长的一阵冷场。吉米真希望女人能够回来。","There was a long pause.Jimmy wished the woman would come back."
"“我把你看成是一种工具。”矿工说道。“有些东西总会破裂。而你就是破坏它的工具。”","“I look on you as an instrument,” said the miner.“Something had to break.You are the instrument that breaks it.”"
"和这个瘦弱、冷漠、固执的男人坐在同一间屋子里，让人感到很奇怪。吉米对他有点着迷了。然而，同时，他又恨他，因为他不能够和他同处一室而不受他魔力的影响。他觉得自己被控制住了。而他讨厌这样。","It was strange to sit in the room with this thin, remote, wilful man.Jimmy was a bit fascinated by him.But, at the same time, he hated him because he could not be in the same room with him without being under his spell.He felt himself dominated.And he hated it."
"“我妻子，”皮尼格抬头看看吉米，咧着嘴奇怪地、近乎滑稽地嘲笑道，“指望看着我在她离开我之后潦倒不堪。这是她最后的希望。”","“My wife,” said Pinnegar, looking up at Jimmy with a peculiar, almost humorous, teasing grin, “expects to see me go to the dogs when she leaves me.It is her last hope.”"
"吉米低下头，沉默无语，不知道该说什么好。另外一个男人仍然一动不动地坐在椅子上，像一个非常耐心的囚犯，望着窗外，等待着。","Jimmy ducked his head and was silent, not knowing what to say.The other man sat still in his chair, like a sort of infinitely patient prisoner, looking away out of the window and waiting."
"“她认为，”他又说道，“某个光明的未来正在某处等着她，而你将会为她开启这扇门。”","“She thinks,” he said again, “that she has some wonderful future awaiting her somewhere, and you’re going to open the door.”"
"他的眼睛里再次流露出同样的讥讽笑意。","And again the same amused grin was in his eyes."
"吉米再次被这个男人所震慑。而且他再次厌恶这震慑的魔力。因为在吉米的心里面，他想要成为男人中最强大的男人，特别是在女人心中最强大的男人。而这个瘦削、奇怪的男人能够控制住他。他意识到了。正是皮尼格对他的沉默和无视控制了整个房间，不管他在哪儿。","And again Jimmy was fascinated by the man.And again he hated the spell of this fascination.For Jimmy wanted to be, in his own mind, the strongest man among men, but particularly among women.And this thin, peculiar man could dominate him.He knew it.The very silent unconsciousness of Pinnegar dominated the room, wherever he was."
"吉米讨厌这样。","Jimmy hated this."
"最后皮尼格太太回来了，而吉米也同她一块儿出发了。他和矿工握握手。","At last Mrs. Pinnegar came back, and Jimmy set off with her.He shook hands with the collier."
"“再见！”他说道。","“Good-bye!” he said."
"“再见！”皮尼格边说，边低着头用那嘲讽的蓝眼睛看着他，吉米知道他再也不可能弄懂那眼神的意味。","“Good-bye!” said Pinnegar, looking down at him with those amused blue eyes, which Jimmy knew he would never be able to get beyond."
"而去车站的这次步行，几乎是戴眼镜的男人和高个子女人对付身后那个男人的一场阴谋。他们把星期一的事情安排得非常详细。埃米莉会乘坐九点整的火车去，吉米会在马里莱波尼迎接她，然后把她安顿到自己在圣约翰伍德的住所。之后，他们将和孩子一起，开始一段新的生活。皮尼格会和他妻子离婚，或者她会和他离婚，接着就是一段新的婚姻。","And the walk to the station was almost a walk of conspiracy against the man left behind, between the man in spectacles and the tall woman.They arranged the details for Monday.Emily was to come by the nine o’clock train: Jimmy would meet her at Marylebone, and instal her in his house in St John’s Wood.Then, with the child, they would begin a new life.Pinnegar would divorce his wife, or she would divorce him: and then, another marriage."
"在回家的途中，吉米从所有的这一切中得到了极大的快乐。他感觉到自己真的做了一件铤而走险且十分刺激的事情。但是他现在处于极度不安的状态，他不能分析出任何的后果。直到他即将抵达伦敦的时候，突然一种虚脱感涌了上来。办完所有这些事情之后，他完全垮掉了，几乎是累得站不起来。","Jimmy got a tremendous kick out of it all on the journey home.He felt he had really done something desperate and adventurous.But he was in too wild a flutter to analyse any results.Only, as he drew near London, a sinking feeling came over him.He was desperately tired after it all, almost too tired to keep up."
"尽管如此，他还是去吃了顿饭，然后把所有的事讲给塞弗恩听。","Nevertheless, he went after dinner and sprang it all on Severn."
"“你这个大傻瓜！”塞弗恩惊愕地说道，“你为什么这么做？”","“You damn fool!” said Severn, in consternation.“What did you do it for?”"
"“呃，”吉米扭扭身子说道，“因为我想要这么做。”","“Well,” said Jimmy, writhing.“Because I wanted to.”"
"“天哪！听你一说，这个女人像美杜莎的头目。我不得不说，你真是个有胆量的英雄！还记得克拉丽莎吗？”","“Good God!The woman sounds like the head of Medusa.You’re a hero of some stomach, I must say!Remember Clarissa?”"
"“噢，”吉米痛苦地回答道，“但这次不一样。”","“Oh,” writhed Jimmy.“But this is different.”"
"“唉，她的名字叫埃玛，或者诸如此类的，是吧？”","“Ay, her name’s Emma, or something of that sort, isn’t it?”"
"“埃米莉！”吉米简短地说。","“Emily!” said Jimmy briefly."
"“好吧，不管怎样，你就是一个傻瓜，因此你不妨按照你的性格，继续这样做吧。我毫不怀疑，通过扮演垂柳的角色，你将经受住所有女人的袭击，对于这些袭击你已经做好了准备。我也从来没有见到过一棵垂柳被一阵大风给连根拔起，因此继续说吧，你没问题的。祝你好运！但是对于一个想要寻找像格雷琴般的女人来崇拜自己的男人，你是一个佼佼者。”","“Well, you’re a fool, anyway, so you may as well keep on acting in character.I’ve no doubt, by playing weeping-willow, you’ll outlive all the female storms you ever prepare for yourself.I never yet did see a weeping-willow uprooted by a gale, so keep on hanging your harp on it, and you’ll be all right.Here’s luck!But for a man who was looking for a little Gretchen to adore him, you’re a corker!”"
"那是赛弗恩讲的所有的话。然而，吉米回家的时候，两个膝盖不停地发抖。星期天的早上，他写了一封充满焦虑的信。他不知道怎样开头：亲爱的皮尼格太太或亲爱的埃米莉，这不是看似晚了点就是早了点。所以他勉强地着手进入正题，没有用任何亲爱的之类的称呼。","Which was all that Severn had to say.But Jimmy went home with his knees shaking.On Sunday morning he wrote an anxious letter.He didn’t know how to begin it: Dear Mrs. Pinnegar and Dear Emily seemed either too late in the day or too early.So he just plunged in, without dear anything."
"“我希望你在来之前先读读这封信。也许我们有点太仓促了。我只是请求你，在你来之前，为你自己做一个最后的决定。如果你自己不能完全肯定，那请你不要来。如果你有丝毫的不确定，那就等等，等到你完全确定为止，来或不来。","“I want you to have this before you come.Perhaps we have been precipitate.I only beg you to decide finally, for yourself, before you come.Don’t come, please, unless you are absolutely sure of yourself.If you are in the least unsure, wait a while, wait till you are quite certain, one way or the other."
"“对我自己来说，如果你不来，我会理解。但是请给我发一份电报。如果你的确要来，我会欢迎你和你的孩子。你永远的：吉米·弗里思”","“For myself, if you don’t come I shall understand.But please send me a telegram.If you do come, I shall welcome both you and the child.Yours ever—J. F. ”"
"吉米为送信人付了往返的旅费和三英镑的附加费，让他星期天去送这封信。","He paid a man his return fare, and three pounds extra, to go on the Sunday and deliver this letter."
"送信人晚上回来了。他已经送出去了这封信。但是没有回音。","The man came back in the evening.He had delivered the letter.There was no answer."
"星期天的晚上过得糟糕透顶；星期一的早上也紧张不安！","Awful Sunday night: tense Monday morning!"
"电报来了：“12：50同简抵马里莱波尼。你永远的：埃米莉。”","A telegram: “Arrive Marylebone 12.50 with Jane.Yours ever,Emily.”"
"吉米咬咬牙，去了车站。然而当他与她视线相对，看着她慢慢地从站台下来，手上牵着孩子，她那笔直的眉毛下似猫般慵懒的眼睛正在对着他发光的时候，他几乎厥倒。当他伸出手时，一个无力的微笑掠过他的嘴角。然而，他却说：","Jimmy set his teeth and went to the station.But when he felt her looking at him, and so met her eyes: and after that saw her coming slowly down the platform, holding the child by the hand, her slow cat’s eyes smouldering under her straight brows, smouldering at him: he almost swooned.A sickly grin came over him as he held out his hand.Nevertheless he said:"
"“我真的很高兴你能来。”","“I’m awfully glad you came.”"
"当他坐在出租车上的时候，对这个女人的一种反常却强烈的情欲占据了他，让他几乎不能控制。他能感觉到，非常强烈地感觉到，她另一个男人的存在，这种想法像纯净的烈酒一样进入了他的脑袋。另一个男人！不知怎么，那个丈夫，他确实活生生地存在着。女人已经走进了他的灵魂。她在走投无路的情况下嫁给了他。","And as he sat in the taxi, a perverse but intense desire for her came over him, making him almost helpless.He could feel, so strongly, the presence of that other man about her, and this went to his head like neat spirits.That other man!In some subtle, inexplicable way, he was actually bodily present, the husband.The woman moved in his aura.She was hopelessly married to him."
"而这个想法就像纯净的威士忌一样涌进吉米的大脑。在他之前，这两个人谁会先垮掉，谁会先更重地跌落呢——这个女人，抑或是那个男人——她的丈夫？","And this went to Jimmy’s head like neat whisky.Which of the two would fall before him with a greater fall—the woman, or the man, her husband?"
