"在萨莫塞特游艇上，人们为了庆祝圣诞节做了相当大规模的安排。由于数月来所停泊的港口都人迹罕至，储备的食品已所剩不多了，但是明妮·邓肯还是设法为驾驶舱和水手舱的人们筹划了真正的盛筵。","Arrangements quite extensive had been made for the celebration of Christmas on the yacht Samoset.Not having been in any civilized port for months, the stock of provisions boasted few delicacies; yet Minnie Duncan had managed to devise real feasts for cabin and forecastle."
"“听着，博伊德，”她对自己的丈夫说，“这是菜单。给驾驶舱的，纯天然又美味的本土风味，有海龟汤、萨莫塞特风味煎蛋卷——”","“Listen, Boyd, she told her husband.“Here are the menus.For the cabin, raw bonita native style, turtle soup, omelette a la Samoset—”"
"“你究竟怎么弄到的？”博伊德·邓肯打断说。","“What the dickens?”Boyd Duncan interrupted."
"“嗯，你要是非得知道的话，我找到了掉在冷藏室后面的一罐蘑菇和一包蛋粉，还有其他一些东西也快掉到那后面去了。但是别打断我。煮山药、炸芋头、鳄梨沙拉——你瞧，你把我搞糊涂了，然后我发现了最后半磅鲜美的干鱿鱼。如果我能把这些话敲击富山的脑子里，那么我们还会有墨西哥烤豆；马克萨斯蜂蜜烤木瓜，最后是美味的馅饼，富山拒绝透露制作这个馅饼的秘方。”","“Well, if you must know, I found a tin of mushrooms and a package of egg-powder which had fallen down behind the locker, and there are other things as well that will go into it.But don’t interrupt.Boiled yam, fried taro, alligator pear salad—there, you’ve got me all mixed, then I found a last delectable half-pound of dried squid.There will be baked beans Mexican, if I can hammer it into Toyama’s head; also, baked papaia with Marquesan honey, and, lastly, a wonderful pie the secret of which Toyama refuses to divulge.”"
"“我在想有没有可能用贸易朗姆酒调制出潘趣酒或者鸡尾酒？”邓肯阴郁地嘀咕着说。","“I wonder if it is possible to concoct a punch or a cocktail out of trade rum?”Duncan muttered gloomily."
"“哦！我给忘了！跟我来。”","“Oh!I forgot!Come with me.”"
"他的妻子抓起他的手，带他穿过小门来到她精巧的特等舱。她仍旧握着他的手，另一只手在一个帽子柜深处摸索，拿出了一瓶一品脱的香槟。","His wife caught his hand and led him through the small connecting door to her tiny stateroom.Still holding his hand, she fished in the depths of a hat-locker and brought forth a pint bottle of champagne."
"“这下晚餐可完整了！”他叫道。","“The dinner is complete!” he cried."
"“等等。”","“Wait.”"
"她又摸了摸，摸到一个银色的威士忌瓶子。她把瓶子对着舷窗处的光，看到瓶里的酒还剩四分之一。","She fished again, and was rewarded with a silver-mounted whisky flask.She held it to the light of a port-hole, and the liquor showed a quarter of the distance from the bottom."
"“我保存了好几个星期了，”她解释说，“够你和德特马船长喝的了。”","“I’ve been saving it for weeks,” she explained.“And there’s enough for you and Captain Dettmar.”"
"“非常小的两杯酒。”邓肯抱怨着。","“Two mighty small drinks,” Duncan complained."
"“本来还能多些的，但是洛伦佐生病的时候，我给他喝了一杯。”","“There would have been more, but I gave a drink to Lorenzo when he was sick.”"
"邓肯开玩笑地咆哮道：“你大可以给他朗姆酒喝啊。”","Duncan growled, “Might have given him rum,” facetiously."
"“恶心的东西！给一个病人？别贪得无厌了，博伊德。由于德特马船长的缘故，我已经庆幸只有这些酒了。他总是喝了酒就变暴躁。现在跟你说说给伙计们的晚餐。苏打饼干，甜蛋糕，糖果——”","“The nasty stuff!For a sick man?Don’t be greedy, Boyd.And I’m glad there isn’t any more, for Captain Dettmar’s sake.Drinking always makes him irritable.And now for the men’s dinner.Soda crackers, sweet cakes, candy—”"
"“很丰盛，我必须要说。”","“Substantial, I must say.”"
"“嘘。米饭，还有咖喱，洋芋，芋头，当然都是很美味的，富山做的大蛋糕，嫩猪肉——”","“Do hush.Rice, and curry, yam, taro, bonita, of course, a big cake Toyama is making, young pig—”"
"“哦，我说。”他反对说。","“Oh, I say,” he protested."
"“没关系，博伊德。我们会在三天之后到达阿图—阿图。而且，那是我的猪。那个不知姓名的老主管明确说是送给我的。你亲眼见过他的。然后是两听牛肉罐头。这是他们的晚餐了。现在再说说礼物。我们是等到明天给他们礼物呢，还是今天晚上就给？”","“It is all right, Boyd.We’ll be in Attu-Attu in three days.Besides, it’s my pig.That old chief what-ever-his-name distinctly presented it to me.You saw him yourself.And then two tins of bullamacow.That’s their dinner.And now about the presents.Shall we wait until tomorrow, or give them this evening?”"
"“当然在圣诞夜给了。”这个男人说，“我们在报时钟敲响八下的时候把所有的船员叫来；我会给每个船员发放一点朗姆酒，然后你给他们发礼物。去甲板上吧。甲板下面叫人喘不过气来。我希望洛伦佐能修好发电机；如果我们被赶到下面来睡觉的话，没有风扇今天晚上就睡不了多少觉了。","“Christmas Eve, by all means,” was the man’s judgment.“We’ll call all hands at eight bells; I’ll give them a tot of rum all around, and then you give the presents.Come on up on deck.It’s stifling down here.I hope Lorenzo has better luck with the dynamo; without the fans there won’t be much sleeping to-night if we’re driven below.”"
"他们穿过这间小主舱，爬上陡直的舱室升降梯，来到了甲板上。太阳正在落山，这预示着一个晴朗的热带夜晚即将来临。萨莫塞特号的两侧撑起前桅帆和主桅帆，以每小时四海里的速度慵懒地划过平静的海面。一阵捶打声从发动机舱的天窗传来。他们向船尾信步走去，在那里德特马船长正一只脚踩着围栏，给拖曳式计程仪的齿轮上油。在船舵的旁边站着一个来自南海岛的高个子，他穿着白汗衫，裹着猩红色的遮羞布。","They passed through the small main-cabin, climbed a steep companion ladder, and emerged on deck.The sun was setting, and the promise was for a clear tropic night.The Samoset, with fore-and main-sail winged out on either side, was slipping a lazy four-knots through the smooth sea.Through the engine-room skylight came a sound of hammering.They strolled aft to where Captain Dettmar, one foot on the rail, was oiling the gear of the patent log.At the wheel stood a tall South Sea Islander, clad in white undershirt and scarlet hip-cloth."
"博伊德·邓肯是个怪人。至少他的朋友们是这么认为的。","Boyd Duncan was an original.At least that was the belief of his friends."
"虽然他有一大笔财富，什么都不用做就能过上舒舒服服的日子，而他却决定用一种奇怪且最不舒服的方式环游世界。顺便提一句，他对于珊瑚礁有自己的看法，而且与达尔文的大相径庭，并且在多个专题论文和一本书中阐明过他的观点，而现在他又回到了这个爱好上，在南海海域乘着30吨的小游艇巡游，研究礁石的构成。","Of comfortable fortune, with no need to do anything but take his comfort, he elected to travel about the world in outlandish and most uncomfortable ways.Incidentally, he had ideas about coral-reefs, disagreed profoundly with Darwin on that subject, had voiced his opinion in several monographs and one book, and was now back at his hobby, cruising the South Seas in a tiny, thirty-ton yacht and studying reef-formations."
"他的妻子明妮·邓肯也显然是个怪人，她很乐于与丈夫一同漫游世界。除了别的之外，在他们六年精彩的婚姻生活中，她已经陪他一起爬上了钦博拉索山，冬季在阿拉斯加乘坐狗拉的雪橇完成了三千英里的旅程，从加拿大一路骑马到墨西哥，乘坐着十吨重的快艇在地中海航游，从德国划着独木舟穿过欧洲的中心到达黑海。他们这一对酷爱旅行，他块头大肩膀又宽，而她是个身材娇小、肤色偏深、性格开朗的女人，一百五十磅重的身体里全是勇气和耐力，讨人喜欢。","His wife, Minnie Duncan, was also declared an original, inasmuch as she joyfully shared his vagabond wanderings.Among other things, in the six exciting years of their marriage she had climbed Chimborazo with him, made a three-thousand-mile winter journey with dogs and sleds in Alaska, ridden a horse from Canada to Mexico, cruised the Mediterranean in a ten-ton yawl, and canoed from Germany to the Black Sea across the heart of Europe.They were a royal pair of wanderlusters, he, big and broad-shouldered, she a small, brunette, and happy woman, whose one hundred and fifteen pounds were all grit and endurance, and withal, pleasing to look upon."
"萨莫塞特号以前是一艘贸易纵帆船，邓肯在旧金山买下了她，并进行了一番改造。船的内部被改造一新，货仓成了主驾驶舱和特等舱，而在船尾和船腹装上了发动机、发电机、制冷机和蓄电池，还远在船尾的地方装上了油箱。船上必然还载着一小队船员。船上只有博伊德、明妮和德特马船长是白人，尽管圆滑的小个子机械师洛伦佐称自己有一半的白人血统，因为他是带有葡萄牙血统的混血儿。一个日本人做厨师，一个中国人做侍者。四个白人水手组成了最初的船员队伍，但是他们一个接一个地被南海小岛上棕榈叶飘扬的美景所吸引，被岛上的人接替了。于是，其中一个黝黑的船员来自复活节岛，第二个来自卡洛林群岛，第三个来自保莫图斯岛，而第四个是一位身材魁梧的萨摩亚人。在海上，博伊德·邓肯自己就是领航员，是德特马船长的大副，他们两个人都掌舵或者偶尔盯哨瞭望。紧要关头，明妮自己就能掌舵，尤其是在紧急情况下，她证明了自己掌舵比当地的船员更可靠。","The Samoset had been a trading schooner, when Duncan bought her in San Francisco and made alterations.Her interior was wholly rebuilt, so that the hold became main-cabin and staterooms, while abaft amidships were installed engines, a dynamo, an ice machine, storage batteries, and, far in the stern, gasoline tanks.Necessarily, she carried a small crew.Boyd, Minnie, and Captain Dettmar were the only whites on board, though Lorenzo, the small and greasy engineer, laid a part claim to white, being a Portuguese half-caste.A Japanese served as cook, and a Chinese as cabin boy.Four white sailors had constituted the original crew for’ard, but one by one they had yielded to the charms of palm-waving South Sea isles and been replaced by islanders.Thus, one of the dusky sailors hailed from Easter Island, a second from the Carolines, a third from the Paumotus, while the fourth was a gigantic Samoan.At sea, Boyd Duncan, himself a navigator, stood a mate’s watch with Captain Dettmar, and both of them took a wheel or lookout occasionally.On a pinch, Minnie herself could take a wheel, and it was on pinches that she proved herself more dependable at steering than did the native sailors."
"钟响了八下，所有的船员都聚集在船舵附近，博伊德·邓肯拿着一个黑瓶子和一个大杯子出现了。他自己亲自分发朗姆酒，每个船员分到半大杯。尽管这酒很纯很烈，会灼烧着他们胃粘膜，他们还是满脸喜悦地一饮而尽，然后响亮地咂着嘴，表示着赞许。除了饮食有度的侍者李·古姆之外，大家都喝了。这个仪式完毕，他们等待着下一个仪式，即赠送礼物。他们拥有着波利尼西亚人的线条，身躯庞大，肌肉发达，却像是一群孩子，为小事开怀大笑，他们充满期待的黑眼睛在灯塔下熠熠发光，壮硕的身躯随着船的起伏而摇摆。","At eight bells, all hands assembled at the wheel, and Boyd Duncan appeared with a black bottle and a mug.The rum he served out himself, half a mug of it to each man.They gulped the stuff down with many facial expressions of delight, followed by loud lip-smackings of approval, though the liquor was raw enough and corrosive enough to burn their mucous membranes.All drank except Lee Goom, the abstemious cabin boy.This rite accomplished, they waited for the next, the present-giving.Generously molded on Polynesian lines, huge-bodied and heavy-muscled, they were nevertheless like so many children, laughing merrily at little things, their eager black eyes flashing in the lantern light as their big bodies swayed to the heave and roll of the ship."
"明妮点着每个人的名字分发礼物，每次还附上几句好听的话助兴。礼物有贸易手表、折刀、各式包装成包的鱼钩、口嚼烟、火柴，和缠腰用的华丽的棉布条。人们雷鸣般的笑声足以证明博伊德·邓肯受欢迎的程度，他小小的玩笑都能得到大家的回应。","Calling each by name, Minnie gave the presents out, accompanying each presentation with some happy remark that added to the glee.There were trade watches, clasp knives, amazing assortments of fish-hooks in packages, plug tobacco, matches, and gorgeous strips of cotton for loincloths all around.That Boyd Duncan was liked by them was evidenced by the roars of laughter with which they greeted his slightest joking allusion."
"德特马船长面色苍白，倚着船舵箱在一旁观望，只在他的雇主偶然间扫视到他的时候才笑一下。有两次他离开大伙，跑到船舱下面去，每次都只呆一分钟而已。后来，洛伦佐、李·古姆和富山在主舱里收到礼物的时候，他又两次消失在了自己的特等舱。沉睡在德特马灵魂深处的魔鬼偏偏选择了在这个特殊的欢乐时刻苏醒。也许这并不全是魔鬼的错，因为德特马船长选择了在圣诞夜开启私藏了好几个礼拜的一夸脱威士忌酒。","Captain Dettmar, white-faced, smiling only when his employer chanced to glance at him, leaned against the wheel-box, looking on.Twice, he left the group and went below, remaining there but a minute each time.Later, in the main cabin, when Lorenzo, Lee Goom and Toyama received their presents, he disappeared into his stateroom twice again.For of all times, the devil that slumbered in Captain Dettmar’s soul chose this particular time of good cheer to awaken.Perhaps it was not entirely the devil’s fault, for Captain Dettmar, privily cherishing a quart of whisky for many weeks, had selected Christmas Eve for broaching it."
"夜还未深——钟刚敲了两下——此时邓肯和他的妻子站在船舱的升降扶梯旁边，迎着风凝视着，讨论能否把他们的床铺搬到甲板上来。地平线处缓缓聚起了一小片黑云，这是暴风雨的前兆。他们正说起这个的时候，德特马船长从船尾走过来，正打算到下面去。他瞥了他们俩一眼，疑心顿起。他停了下来，脸在抽搐。然后他开口说道：","It was still early in the evening—two bells had just gone—when Duncan and his wife stood by the cabin companionway, gazing to windward and canvassing the possibility of spreading their beds on deck.A small, dark blot of cloud, slowly forming on the horizon, carried the threat of a rain-squall, and it was this they were discussing when Captain Dettmar, coming from aft and about to go below, glanced at them with sudden suspicion.He paused, his face working spasmodically.Then he spoke:"
"“你们正在谈论我。”","“You are talking about me.”"
"他声音沙哑，并带着一丝激动的颤抖。明妮·邓肯吃了一惊，然后瞥见她丈夫平静的面孔，心领神会，于是继续默不作声。","His voice was hoarse, and there was an excited vibration in it.Minnie Duncan started, then glanced at her husband’s immobile face, took the cue, and remained silent."
"“我说你们在议论我。”德特马船长又说了一遍，这次几乎在咆哮。","“I say you were talking about me,” Captain Dettmar repeated, this time with almost a snarl."
"他除了脸在抽搐外，站得还算稳当，也没有其他迹象表明他喝过酒。","He did not lurch nor betray the liquor on him in any way save by the convulsive working of his face."
"“明妮，你最好到下面去。”邓肯温和地说，“告诉李·古姆我们在下面睡。用不了多久暴风雨就会把东西淋湿的。”","“Minnie, you’d better go down,” Duncan said gently.“Tell Lee Goom we’ll sleep below.It won’t be long before that squall is drenching things.”"
"她领会了他的暗示就离开了，只是拖延了一阵，焦虑地扫视了这两个男人模糊的脸庞。","She took the hint and left, delaying just long enough to give one anxious glance at the dim faces of the two men."
"邓肯吸着雪茄，一直等到从开着的天窗里传来他妻子和侍者的谈话声。","Duncan puffed at his cigar and waited till his wife’s voice, in talk with the cabin-boy, came up through the open skylight."
"“怎么了？”邓肯用低沉而尖锐的声音问道。","“Well?”Duncan demanded in a low voice, but sharply."
"“我刚才说你们在谈论我。我现在再说一遍。哦，我可不是瞎子。我天天都看到你们俩在谈论我。你为什么不过来当着我的面说呢！我知道，你什么都知道了。而且我知道你脑子里盘算着在阿图—阿图解雇我。”","“I said you were talking about me.I say it again.Oh, I haven’t been blind.Day after day I’ve seen the two of you talking about me.Why don’t you come out and say it to my face!I know you know.And I know your mind’s made up to discharge me at Attu-Attu.”"
"“你这样胡思乱想，我感到很难过。”邓肯轻声回答。","“I am sorry you are making such a mess of everything,” was Duncan’s quiet reply."
"但是德特马船长满脑子想的都是找麻烦。","But Captain Dettmar’s mind was set on trouble."
"“你们知道你们要解雇我。你们觉得自己太优秀了，不能跟我这样的人交往了——你和你的老婆。”","“You know you are going to discharge me.You think you are too good to associate with the likes of me—you and your wife.”"
"“请不要把她牵扯进来，”邓肯警告说，“你想干什么？”","“Kindly keep her out of this,” Duncan warned.“What do you want?”"
"“我想知道你要干什么！”","“I want to know what you are going to do!”"
"“经过此事，我要在阿图—阿图解雇你。”","“Discharge you, after this, at Attu-Attu.”"
"“你一直就是这么打算的。”","“You intended to, all along.”"
"“恰恰相反。是你现在的行为让我不得不这么做。”","“On the contrary.It is your present conduct that compels me.”"
"“别和我说那种话了。”","“You can’t give me that sort of talk.”"
"“我不能留一个叫我骗子的人当船长。”","“I can’t retain a captain who calls me a liar.”"
"此时，德特马船长吃了一惊。他颤动着脸和嘴唇，却说不出一句话来。邓肯冷静地抽出一根雪茄，瞅见船尾那边的天空里暴雨云层越积越厚。","Captain Dettmar for the moment was taken aback.His face and lips worked, but he could say nothing.Duncan coolly pulled at his cigar and glanced aft at the rising cloud of squall."
"“是李·古姆在塔希提岛把信带上船的。”德特马船长讲了起来。","“Lee Goom brought the mail aboard at Tahiti,” Captain Dettmar began."
"“我们的船短暂停靠后就离开了。你一直都没读那些信，直到我们到外面了你才看的，可是那时已经太迟了。这就是你没有在塔希提岛解雇我的原因。哦，我知道。李·古姆来这边的时候，我看见那个长信封了。那信是从加州州长寄来的，印在信封角上了，谁都看得见。你一直在我背后搞鬼。有个火奴鲁鲁的流浪汉悄悄告诉你了，然后你就写信给州长，请他查明那事。李·古姆带给你的信就是州长的回复。你在我面前为什么就不能像个男人！不，你肯定是在我背后搞鬼，你明知这份工作是我重新自立的机会。而你看完州长的信后，就决定甩掉我了。这几个月来我已经从你的脸上看出来了。我已经看透你们俩了，你们表面上对我非常客气，背后却跑到角落里谈论我和我在旧金山的那件事。”","“We were hove short then and leaving.You didn’t look at your letters until we were outside, and then it was too late.That’s why you didn’t discharge me at Tahiti.Oh, I know.I saw the long envelope when Lee Goom came over the side.It was from the Governor of California, printed on the corner for any one to see.You’d been working behind my back.Some beachcomber in Honolulu had whispered to you, and you’d written to the Governor to find out.And that was his answer Lee Goom carried out to you.Why didn’t you come to me like a man!No, you must play underhand with me, knowing that this billet was the one chance for me to get on my feet again.And as soon as you read the Governor’s letter your mind was made up to get rid of me.I’ve seen it on your face ever since for all these months.I’ve seen the two of you, polite as hell to me all the time, and getting away in corners and talking about me and that affair in ’Frisco.”"
"“你说完了吗？”邓肯问，他的声音低沉而紧张，“说得差不多了吧？”","“Are you done?”Duncan asked, his voice low, and tense.“Quite done?”"
"德特马船长没有回答。","Captain Dettmar made no answer."
"“那么让我来告诉你一些事。正是因为旧金山的那件事我才没有在塔希提岛解雇你。上帝知道你惹我惹得够多的了。我原以为如果有人需要一个机会从头再来，那么你就是那个人。要是你过去没什么污点，我在知道你正如何掠夺我的时候就解雇你了。”","“Then I’ll tell you a few things.It was precisely because of that affair in ’Frisco that I did not discharge you in Tahiti.God knows you gave me sufficient provocation.I thought that if ever a man needed a chance to rehabilitate himself, you were that man.Had there been no black mark against you, I would have discharged you when I learned how you were robbing me.”"
"德特马船长流露出诧异的神情，本想打断，又改变了主意。","Captain Dettmar showed surprise, started to interrupt, then changed his mind."
"“在像这样的事上：甲板塞缝、铜舵纽、发动机大修、崭新的大三角帆撑艇杆、全新的吊艇架、捕鲸船的维修。是你批准的船坞的账单。共花了4122法郎。按正常的船坞费来算，不会超过2500法郎的，一生丁都不会多——”","“There was that matter of the deck-calking, the bronze rudder-irons, the overhauling of the engine, the new spinnaker boom, the new davits, and the repairs to the whale-boat.You OK’d the shipyard bill.It was four thousand one hundred and twenty-two francs.By the regular shipyard charges it ought not to have been a centime over twenty-five hundred francs—”"
"“你如果拿沿岸那些骗子的话来攻击我——”德特马船长粗声粗气地说。","“If you take the word of those alongshore sharks against mine—” the other began thickly."
"“你不用再编下去了，省省吧，”邓肯冷冷地继续说，“我调查过了。我在找州长之前就见过弗劳宾，那个老无赖承认多收了1600法郎。说是有你给他撑腰。你留下了1200法郎，他分到400法郎，还得到了那份工作。别打断我。我已经得到了他的口供，就收在这下面。之后，要不是你心情低落，我本来要把你送上岸的。你很需要这次机会，否则只能直接下地狱。我就给了你这次机会。关于这个你有什么要说的吗？”","“Save yourself the trouble of further lying,” Duncan went on coldly.“I looked it up.I got Flaubin before the Governor himself, and the old rascal confessed to sixteen hundred overcharge.Said you’d stuck him up for it.Twelve hundred went to you, and his share was four hundred and the job.Don’t interrupt.I’ve got his affidavit below.Then was when I would have put you ashore, except for the cloud you were under.You had to have this one chance or go clean to hell.I gave you the chance.And what have you got to say about it?”"
"“州长说什么了？”德特马船长恶狠狠地问。","“What did the Governor say?”Captain Dettmar demanded truculently."
"“哪个州长？”","“Which governor?”"
"“加利福尼亚的。他也跟其他所有人一样骗了你吗？”","“Of California.Did he lie to you like all the rest?”"
"“我来告诉你他说了什么。他说是凭着间接证据判你有罪，这就是为什么你被判无期徒刑，而没被绞死；你一直坚称自己是清白的；你是马里兰·德特马家族的败家子，他们因为你的缘故东躲西藏；你在监狱表现优秀；你被判刑的时候，他是检举律师；你服刑了七年后，他同意了你家人的恳求，赦免了你；他心里不相信你杀死了麦克斯威尼。","“I’ll tell you what he said.He said that you had been convicted on circumstantial evidence; that was why you had got life imprisonment instead of hanging; that you had always stoutly maintained your innocence; that you were the black sheep of the Maryland Dettmars; that they moved heaven and earth for your pardon; that your prison conduct was most exemplary; that he was prosecuting attorney at the time you were convicted; that after you had served seven years he yielded to your family’s plea and pardoned you; and that in his own mind existed a doubt that you had killed McSweeny.”"
"邓肯停顿了一下，观察了一下正在加剧的暴风雨，而德特马船长的脸变得极其难看。","There was a pause, during which Duncan went on studying the rising squall, while Captain Dettmar’s face worked terribly."
"“嗯，州长错了。”他说道，大笑一声，“我确实杀死了麦克斯威尼。那晚，我确实把那个门卫给灌醉了。我把麦克斯威尼打死在他的床上。我用的正是证据里出现的铁系索栓。他一点反抗的机会都没有。我把他打成了浆糊。你想知道细节吗？”","“Well, the Governor was wrong,” he announced, with a short laugh.“I did kill McSweeny.I did get the watchman drunk that night.I beat McSweeny to death in his bunk.I used the iron belaying pin that appeared in the evidence.He never had a chance.I beat him to a jelly.Do you want the details?”"
"邓肯像看怪物一样好奇地看着他，却没有回答。","Duncan looked at him in the curious way one looks at any monstrosity, but made no reply."
"“哦，我不怕跟你讲，”德特马船长继续气势汹汹地说，“当时没有目击证人。而且，我现在是自由人了。我被赦免了，而且老天作证，他们再也不能把我关回去了。我第一拳就打碎了麦克斯威尼的下巴。他正平躺着睡觉。他说：‘我的天，吉姆！我的天！’他说话的时候，那碎了的下巴震颤着，看上去很可笑。然后我就揍他……我说，你想知道其他的细节吗？”","“Oh, I’m not afraid to tell you,” Captain Dettmar blustered on.“There are no witnesses.Besides, I am a free man now.I am pardoned, and by God they can never put me back in that hole again.I broke McSweeny’s jaw with the first blow.He was lying on his back asleep.He said, ‘My God, Jim! My God!’ It was funny to see his broken jaw wabble as he said it.Then I smashed him…I say, do you want the rest of the details?”"
"“那就是你要说的一切？”邓肯回答。","“Is that all you have to say?” was the answer."
"“难道不够吗？”德特马船长反驳道。","“Isn’t it enough?”Captain Dettmar retorted."
"“足够了。”","“It is enough.”"
"“现在你打算怎么做？”","“What are you going to do about it?”"
"“在阿图—阿图把你送上岸。”","“Put you ashore at Attu-Attu.”"
"“同时呢？”","“And in the meantime?”"
"“同时……”邓肯停顿了一下。风越加大了，他的头发都被吹起来。天空中的星星消失了，由于舵手的粗心，萨莫塞特号偏离了航线四个点。“同时把你的升降索扔到甲板上，看好你的舵轮。我去叫人来。”","“In the meantime…” Duncan paused.An increase of weight in the wind rippled his hair.The stars overhead vanished, and the Samoset swung four points off her course in the careless steersman’s hands.“In the meantime throw your halyards down on deck and look to your wheel.I’ll call the men.”"
"转瞬间暴风雨突降。德特马船长跳到船尾，把卷着的主帆升降索从栓上抬起，扔到甲板上以备运行。三个岛民从极小的前甲板挤过来，其中两个跳向升降索，抓住并单匝的，而第三人扣牢机舱和甲板天窗，并转动通风机。在甲板下，李·古姆和富山降下天窗盖，拧紧三孔滑轮。邓肯拉紧甲板天窗煤仓孔的防护罩，一直拉着，直到雨水噼噼啪啪地击打着他的脸，而萨莫塞特号猛烈地向前冲去，与此同时，由于向外支起的船帆遭到猛烈袭击，萨莫塞特号一会儿向右舷倾斜，一会儿向左舷倾斜。","The next moment the squall burst upon them.Captain Dettmar, springing aft, lifted the coiled mainsail halyards from their pins and threw them, ready to run, on the deck.The three islanders swarmed from the tiny forecastle, two of them leaping to the halyards and holding by a single turn, while the third fastened down the engineroom, companion and swung the ventilators around.Below, Lee Goom and Toyama were lowering skylight covers and screwing up deadeyes.Duncan pulled shut the cover of the companion scuttle, and held on, waiting, the first drops of rain pelting his face, while the Samoset leaped violently ahead, at the same time heeling first to starboard then to port as the gusty pressures caught her winged-out sails."
"所有人等待着。不过，并不需要跑着降下帆篷。风力变弱之后，热带暴雨倾盆而至，淹没了一切。然后，危机解除，那些夏威夷人开始把升降索绕回栓上，博伊德·邓肯走向船舱。","All waited.But there was no need to lower away on the run.The power went out of the wind, and the tropic rain poured a deluge over everything.Then it was, the danger past, and as the Kanakas began to coil the halyards back on the pins, that Boyd Duncan went below."
"“好了。”他进到船里，兴高采烈地对着妻子说，“就一阵。”","“All right,” he called in cheerily to his wife.“Only a puff.”"
"“德特马船长呢？”她问道。","“And Captain Dettmar?” she queried."
"“喝酒呢，就是这样。我要在阿图—阿图甩掉他。”","“Has been drinking, that is all.I shall get rid of him at Attu-Attu.”"
"但邓肯在爬上床铺之前，在睡衣里面贴身绑上了一把沉甸甸的自动手枪。","But before Duncan climbed into his bunk, he strapped around himself, against the skin and under his pajama coat, a heavy automatic pistol."
"他很快就睡着了，这得益于他能够彻底放松的天赋。他做事情很紧张，就像野蛮人一样，但一旦没有什么需要了，他就会彻底放松身心。他睡着了，大雨倾泻在甲板上，海面上狂风乱作，小艇在这波涛汹涌的海上沉沉浮浮。","He fell asleep almost immediately, for his was the gift of perfect relaxation.He did things tensely, in the way savages do, but the instant the need passed he relaxed, mind and body.So it was that he slept, while the rain still poured on deck and the yacht plunged and rolled in the brief, sharp sea caused by the squall."
"他醒来的时候，有种窒息和沉重的感觉。电扇停下了，空气既厚重又沉闷。他心里咒骂着洛伦佐和蓄电池，耳边传来他妻子在毗邻的特等舱里走动的声音，他听见她走进了主舱。他想妻子显然是要到甲板上呼吸一下新鲜空气，于是决定也这么办。他穿上拖鞋跟在她后面，胳膊下夹着枕头和毯子。他正要从甲板梯出来的时候，船舱里的钟开始报时，于是他停下来听。钟响了四下。这时是凌晨两点。从外面传来斜桁嘴蹭着桅杆的咯吱声。萨莫塞特号在海上时晃时稳，微风吹动着她扬起的船帆，发出空隆隆的敲打声。","He awoke with a feeling of suffocation and heaviness.The electric fans had stopped, and the air was thick and stifling.Mentally cursing all Lorenzos and storage batteries, he heard his wife moving in the adjoining stateroom and pass out into the main cabin.Evidently heading for the fresher air on deck, he thought, and decided it was a good example to imitate.Putting on his slippers and tucking a pillow and a blanket under his arm, he followed her.As he was about to emerge from the companionway, the ship’s clock in the cabin began to strike and he stopped to listen.Four bells sounded.It was two in the morning.From without came the creaking of the gaff-jaw against the mast.The Samoset rolled and righted on a sea, and in the light breeze her canvas gave forth a hollow thrum."
"他正把腿迈上潮湿的甲板，就听见了妻子的尖叫声。在这充满惊恐的叫声之后，只剩下船边飞溅的水花。他跳了出来，跑到船尾。在微弱的星光下，他看见她的头和肩膀消失在船缓缓划过的尾流里。","He was just putting his foot out on the damp deck when he heard his wife scream.It was a startled frightened scream that ended in a splash overside.He leaped out and ran aft.In the dim starlight he could make out her head and shoulders disappearing astern in the lazy wake."
"“那是什么？”掌舵的德特马船长问。","“What was it?”Captain Dettmar, who was at the wheel, asked."
"“邓肯夫人。”邓肯回答道，他解开挂在钩子上的救生圈，向船尾扔去，“转向右舷，迎风行驶！”他命令道。","“Mrs. Duncan,” was Duncan’s reply, as he tore the life-buoy from its hook and flung it aft.“Jibe over to starboard and come up on the wind!” he commanded."
"然而之后博伊德·邓肯犯了个错误。他跳入水中。","And then Boyd Duncan made a mistake.He dived overboard."
"他从水中钻出来时，一眼看到救生圈上的蓝光，救生圈见水后便会自动发出这道蓝光。他向救生圈游去，发现明妮已经先够到了。","When he came up, he glimpsed the blue-light on the buoy, which had ignited automatically when it struck the water.He swam for it, and found Minnie had reached it first."
"“嗨，”他说，“就是想凉快凉快？”","“Hello,” he said.“Just trying to keep cool?”"
"“哦，博伊德！”她回答道，然后伸出一只湿湿的手，摸到了他的手。","“Oh, Boyd!” was her answer, and one wet hand reached out and touched his."
"几经腐蚀或破坏，蓝光已变得若隐若现。平稳的海浪将他们推向浪尖，邓肯转头望见萨莫塞特在黑暗中模糊的影子。看不见光亮，却能听见混乱的喧哗声。他能听见德特马船长的喊叫声，那声音压过了其他人的叫喊。","The blue light, through deterioration or damage, flickered out.As they lifted on the smooth crest of a wave, Duncan turned to look where the Samoset made a vague blur in the darkness.No lights showed, but there was noise of confusion.He could hear Captain Dettmar’s shouting above the cries of the others."
"“我得说，他并不着急。”邓肯咕哝着，“他为什么不掉转方向？现在船开走了。”","“I must say he’s taking his time,” Duncan grumbled.“Why doesn’t he jibe?There she goes now.”"
"他们能够听到移动船帆时吊杆滑轮发出的咯咯的响声。","They could hear the rattle of the boom tackle blocks as the sail was eased across."
"“那是主桅帆，”他轻声说，“我让他转向右舷，他却转向了左舷。”","“That was the mainsail,” he muttered.“Jibed to port when I told him starboard.”"
"海浪又把他们托了起来，一次接着一次，他们这才看见远处萨莫塞特号右舷的绿灯。船没有停下，也就意味着不会过来救他们，而是在他们眼前开走了。邓肯咒骂着。","Again they lifted on a wave, and again and again, ere they could make out the distant green of the Samoset’s starboard light.But instead of remaining stationary, in token that the yacht was coming toward them, it began moving across their field of vision.Duncan swore."
"“那个傻大个在那做什么呢！”他说道，“他有指南针。他知道我们的方向。”","“What’s the lubber holding over there for!” he demanded.“He’s got his compass.He knows our bearing.”"
"但他们唯一能看到的就是那绿光，而且他们只有在浪尖上的时候才能看得见，只见那绿光缓缓地离他们而去，迎风前行，越来越暗淡了。邓肯一次又一次地大声呼叫，每一次喊完后，他们都能隐隐约约听到德特马船长喊着下达指令的声音。","But the green light, which was all they could see, and which they could see only when they were on top of a wave, moved steadily away from them, withal it was working up to windward, and grew dim and dimmer.Duncan called out loudly and repeatedly, and each time, in the intervals, they could hear, very faintly, the voice of Captain Dettmar shouting orders."
"“这么吵，他怎么能听得见我呢？”邓肯抱怨着。","“How can he hear me with such a racket?” Duncan complained."
"“他这样做，船员就听不见你的声音了。”明妮答道。","“He’s doing it so the crew won’t hear you,” was Minnie’s answer."
"她说话的语气很平静，这引起了他丈夫的注意。","There was something in the quiet way she said it that caught her husband’s attention."
"“你是什么意思？”","“What do you mean?”"
"“我的意思是他不打算救我们上船。”她同样平静地继续说着，“是他把我扔下水的。”","“I mean that he is not trying to pick us up,” she went on in the same composed voice.“He threw me overboard.”"
"“你不是失足掉下来的？”","“You are not making a mistake?”"
"“我怎么可能？我在主索具旁边，看看还有没有下雨的迹象。他肯定是离开了船舵，蹑手蹑脚地在后面跟着我。我用一只手抓住支索。他从后面掰开我的手，然后把我扔出去的。太槽糕了，你都不知道，要不然你就呆在船上了。”","“How could I?I was at the main rigging, looking to see if any more rain threatened.He must have left the wheel and crept behind me.I was holding on to a stay with one hand.He gripped my hand free from behind and threw me over.It’s too bad you didn’t know, or else you would have stayed aboard.”"
"邓肯叹了口气，沉默了许久。绿灯改变了航行的方向。","Duncan groaned, but said nothing for several minutes.The green light changed the direction of its course."
"“船开走了。”他说，“你是对的。他故意让船绕过我们，迎风行驶。迎着风他们就听不到我的声音了。但已经这样了。”","“She’s gone about,” he announced.“You are right.He’s deliberately working around us and to windward.Up wind they can never hear me.But here goes.”"
"他隔几分钟就喊上一次，喊了好久。绿光消失了，取而代之的是红光，表示游艇又开走了。","He called at minute intervals for a long time.The green light disappeared, being replaced by the red, showing that the yacht had gone about again."
"“明妮，”他最后说，“跟你说这个我很难受，可是你嫁了个傻瓜。只有傻瓜才会像我一样从船上跳下来。”","“Minnie,” he said finally, “it pains me to tell you, but you married a fool.Only a fool would have gone overboard as I did.”"
"“我们获救的机会……我指的是被其他的船只救的机会有多少？”她问。","“What chance have we of being picked up…by some other vessel, I mean?” she asked."
"“万分之一，或者十亿分之一。没有一条轮船或者商船的航线经过这片海域。也没有人在南海四处捕鲸。也许会有从图图旺阿过来的走散的贸易纵帆船经过这里。不过我偶然间得知那个岛上一年才来一次人。我们有百万分之一的希望。”","“About one in ten thousand, or ten thousand million.Not a steamer route nor trade route crosses this stretch of ocean.And there aren’t any whalers knocking about the South Seas.There might be a stray trading schooner running across from Tutuwanga.But I happen to know that island is visited only once a year.A chance in a million is ours.”"
"“那我们就来碰碰这个运气吧。”她坚定地回应道。","“And we’ll play that chance,” she rejoined stoutly."
"“你真是个开心果！”他抓住她的手，放在自己的嘴唇上，“而伊丽莎白姨妈总是想知道我在你身上看到了什么。我们当然要来碰碰这个运气。而且，我们也会成功的。否则，会发生的事将不堪设想。开始吧。”","“You ARE a joy!”His hand lifted hers to his lips.“And Aunt Elizabeth always wondered what I saw in you.Of course we’ll play that chance.And we’ll win it, too.To happen otherwise would be unthinkable.Here goes.”"
"他将那把沉重的手枪从腰带上解下来，让它沉到海里。不过，他还是留下了腰带。","He slipped the heavy pistol from his belt and let it sink into the sea.The belt, however, he retained."
"“现在你到救生圈里面睡会儿。从下面钻进去。”","“Now you get inside the buoy and get some sleep.Duck under.”"
"她听话地潜下水，从漂浮的救生圈中钻出来。他把她绑在救生圈上，然后用绑过手枪的皮带穿过肩膀在救生圈的外面扣住自己。","She ducked obediently, and came up inside the floating circle.He fastened the straps for her, then, with the pistol belt, buckled himself across one shoulder to the outside of the buoy."
"“我们明天一天都会没事。”他说，“谢天谢地，水是温的。不管怎样，第一个二十四小时不会难熬。如果黄昏前我们还没有获救，我们就得再坚持一天，就这样。”","“We’re good for all day to-morrow,” he said.“Thank God the water’s warm.It won’t be a hardship for the first twenty-hour hours, anyway.And if we’re not picked up by nightfall, we’ve just got to hang on for another day, that’s all.”"
"他们半个小时都没有说话，邓肯的胳膊搭在救生圈上，头枕在上面，好像是睡着了。","For half an hour they maintained silence, Duncan, his head resting on the arm that was on the buoy, seemed asleep."
"“博伊德？”明妮柔声说。","“Boyd?” Minnie said softly."
"“我以为你睡着了。”他没好气地说。","“Thought you were asleep,” he growled."
"“博伊德，如果我们过不了这关——”","“Boyd, if we don’t come through this—”"
"“别说了！”他毫不客气地打断了她的话，“我们肯定能闯过这关。毋庸置疑。在这片海域的某处有艘船正驶向我们。你就等着瞧吧。要是我的脑子里装着无线电就好了。现在你要是不睡的话，我就睡了。”","“Stow that!” he broke in ungallantly.“Of course we’re coming through.There is isn’t a doubt of it.Somewhere on this ocean is a ship that’s heading right for us.You wait and see.Just the same I wish my brain were equipped with wireless.Now I’m going to sleep, if you don’t.”"
"但这一次，他难以入睡。一个小时后，他听到明妮搅动水的声音，知道她没睡着。","But for once, sleep baffled him.An hour later he heard Minnie stir and knew she was awake."
"“喂，你知道我一直在想什么吗！”她问。","“Say, do you know what I’ve been thinking!” she asked."
"“不知道，想什么？”","“No; what?”"
"“我要祝你圣诞快乐。”","“That I’ll wish you a Merry Christmas.”"
"“天哪，我都没想起来。当然，今天是圣诞节。我们以后还有好多圣诞节要过。那你知道我一直在想什么吗？真是丢人到家了，我们没吃圣诞晚餐就玩完了。等我找德特马算账。我得好好教训他一下。也不用铁系索栓，就两个赤裸裸的拳头就够了。”","“By George, I never thought of it.Of course it’s Christmas Day.We’ll have many more of them, too.And do you know what I’ve been thinking?What a confounded shame we’re done out of our Christmas dinner.Wait till I lay hands on Dettmar.I’ll take it out of him.And it won’t be with an iron belaying pin either, Just two bunches of naked knuckles, that’s all.”"
"虽然博伊德开着玩笑，但他没抱多少希望。他很清楚这百万分之一的机会意味着什么，他很冷静地意识到他和他妻子的人生只剩下最后几个小时——而且这最后几个小时注定是以黑暗和恐怖的悲剧结束。","Despite his facetiousness, Boyd Duncan had little hope.He knew well enough the meaning of one chance in a million, and was calmly certain that his wife and he had entered upon their last few living hours—hours that were inevitably bound to be black and terrible with tragedy."
"热带地区的太阳升起来了，天空晴朗无云。什么也看不到。萨莫塞特号在海的尽头。太阳升得更高些时，邓肯把他睡裤扯成两半，做成两个简陋的头巾。把它们用海水浸湿，来抵挡日晒。","The tropic sun rose in a cloudless sky.Nothing was to be seen.The Samoset was beyond the sea-rim.As the sun rose higher, Duncan ripped his pajama trousers in halves and fashioned them into two rude turbans.Soaked in sea-water they offset the heat-rays."
"“我一想到那顿晚餐就非常生气。”他抱怨着，发现妻子的脸上开始流露出焦虑的神情，“解决德特马的时候，我想让你和我一起去。我向来是反对女人看血腥的场面，但这次不一样。那将会是一顿痛打。”","“When I think of that dinner, I’m really angry,” he complained, as he noted an anxious expression threatening to set on his wife’s face.“And I want you to be with me when I settle with Dettmar.I’ve always been opposed to women witnessing scenes of blood, but this is different.It will be a beating.”"
"“我希望我打他的时候不会伤到我的指关节。”他停顿了一会，又加了一句。","“I hope I don’t break my knuckles on him,” he added, after a pause."
"过了中午，到了下午，他们漂在这片狭窄的海域中央。渐弱的信风轻轻地抚摸着他们，他们随着平静的海浪在夏天的海上单调地起起伏伏。一次，一个海怪发现了他们，绕着他们快速移动，足足绕了半个小时。还有一次，一条从头到尾长二十英尺的巨型鰩鱼在离他们几码处游过。","Midday came and went, and they floated on, the center of a narrow sea-circle.A gentle breath of the dying trade-wind fanned them, and they rose and fell monotonously on the smooth swells of a perfect summer sea.Once, a gunie spied them, and for half an hour circled about them with majestic sweeps.And, once, a huge rayfish, measuring a score of feet across the tips, passed within a few yards."
"到黄昏的时候，明妮开始像孩子一样轻声胡言乱语，喋喋不休。邓肯一边听着，一边四处观察，脸变得枯槁憔悴，他心里计划着，想找出结束这越来越痛苦的几小时的最好方式。就在他冥思苦想时，一个更大的浪把他们高高托起，他扫视海平面一圈，看到了什么东西，大叫了起来。","By sunset, Minnie began to rave, softly, babblingly, like a child.Duncan’s face grew haggard as he watched and listened, while in his mind he revolved plans of how best to end the hours of agony that were coining.And, so planning, as they rose on a larger swell than usual, he swept the circle of the sea with his eyes, and saw, what made him cry out."
"“明妮！”她没有回应，他用尽所有的力气在她耳边又喊了一次她的名字。她睁开了眼睛，眼神透出半清醒半迷糊的状态。他拍打着她的手和手腕，直到疼痛令她清醒了过来。","“Minnie!”She did not answer, and he shouted her name again in her ear, with all the voice he could command.Her eyes opened, in them fluttered commingled consciousness and delirium.He slapped her hands and wrists till the sting of the blows roused her."
"“运气来了，百万分之一的运气！”他叫喊着。","“There she is, the chance in a million!” he cried."
"“有艘轮船正朝我们开过来！天哪，是艘巡洋舰。胜利了！安纳波利斯号载着天文学家从图图旺阿返回来。","“A steamer at that, heading straight for us!By George, it’s a cruiser!I have it—! the Annapolis, returning with those astronomers from Tutuwanga."
"美国领事林富德是个爱吹毛求疵的老先生，他在阿图—阿图工作的两年里从来没有遇到过博伊德·邓肯摆在他面前的这种案子。安纳波利斯号把邓肯及其妻子送上了岸，然后立即载着船上的天文学家驶向斐济。","United States Consul Lingford was a fussy, elderly gentleman, and in the two years of his service at Attu-Attu had never encountered so unprecedented a case as that laid before him by Boyd Duncan.The latter, with his wife, had been landed there by the Annapolis, which had promptly gone on with its cargo of astronomers to Fiji."
"“这是冷血的蓄意谋杀。”林富德领事说，“一定要交给法律惩处。我不知道具体该如何处置德特马船长，但是如果他来了阿图—阿图，根据法律他应该被处置，他——啊——应该被处置。同时，我会研究一下法律条文。那么，您和您夫人何不留下吃顿午餐！”","“It was cold-blooded, deliberate attempt to murder,” said Consul Lingford.“The law shall take its course.I don’t know how precisely to deal with this Captain Dettmar, but if he comes to Attu-Attu, depend upon it he shall be dealt with, he—ah—shall be dealt with.In the meantime, I shall read up the law.And now, won’t you and your good lady stop for lunch!”"
"邓肯接受了邀请，一直往窗外港口眺望的明妮突然身体前倾，碰了碰她丈夫的胳膊。他向她凝视的方向看去，看到了萨莫塞特号，旗子降到桅杆的一半处，船员集合，锚抛在只有一百码远的地方。","As Duncan accepted the invitation, Minnie, who had been glancing out of the window at the harbor, suddenly leaned forward and touched her husband’s arm.He followed her gaze, and saw the Samoset, flag at half mast, rounding up and dropping anchor scarcely a hundred yards away."
"“那就是我的船，”邓肯对领事说，“船舷外有艘汽艇，德特马船长坐上去了。如果我没猜错的话，他会前来向您报告我们的死讯。”","“There’s my boat now,” Duncan said to the Consul.“And there’s the launch over the side, and Captain Dettmar dropping into it.If I don’t miss my guess, he’s coming to report our deaths to you.”"
"汽艇在白色海滩登陆，留下洛伦佐笨手笨脚地修理发动机，德特马船长阔步穿过海滩，踏上前往领事馆的小路。","The launch landed on the white beach, and leaving Lorenzo tinkering with the engine, Captain Dettmar strode across the beach and up the path to the Consulate."
"“让他来报告，”邓肯说，“我们要去隔壁的房间听听。”","“Let him make his report,” Duncan said.“We’ll just step into this next room and listen.”"
"透过这半掩着的门，他和妻子听到德特马船长带着哭腔讲述他的雇主不幸遇难。","And through the partly open door, he and his wife heard Captain Dettmar, with tears in his voice, describe the loss of his owners."
"“我掉转船头返回了原地。”他肯定地说，“完全找不到他们的踪迹。我喊了又喊，但是没有一句回应。我足足花了两个小时来来回回地寻找，船停在海上一直等到黎明，又花了一整天往返巡视，还派了两个人在桅顶观察。太可怕了。我的心都碎了。邓肯先生是个了不起的人，我将永远不……”","“I jibed over and went back across the very spot,” he concluded.“There was not a sign of them.I called and called, but there was never an answer.I tacked back and forth and wore for two solid hours, then hove to till daybreak, and cruised back and forth all day, two men at the mastheads.It is terrible.I am heartbroken.Mr. Duncan was a splendid man, and I shall never…”"
"不过，还没等他把这句话说完，他那了不起的雇主就踱步走到他的面前，留明妮在门口站着。德特马船长苍白的脸变得煞白。","But he never completed the sentence, for at that moment his splendid employer strode out upon him, leaving Minnie standing in the doorway.Captain Dettmar’s white face blanched even whiter."
"“先生，我确实尽了全力去救你们。”他开口说道。","“I did my best to pick you up, sir,” he began."
"博伊德·邓肯用拳头做出了回答，两只紧握的拳头打在德特马船长的左右脸上。","Boyd Duncan’s answer was couched in terms of bunched knuckles, two bunches of them, that landed right and left on Captain Dettmar’s face."
"德特马船长摇晃着向后退，回过神来后就挥动着胳膊向他的雇主冲过去，却又挨了一下子，这一拳正好打在两眼中间。这次船长倒下了，他一头栽到地上，把打字机压在身下。","Captain Dettmar staggered backward, recovered, and rushed with swinging arms at his employer, only to be met with a blow squarely between the eyes.This time the Captain went down, bearing the typewriter under him as he crashed to the floor."
"“这是不允许的。”林富德领事急促地说，“我恳求您，我恳求您停下来。”","“This is not permissible,” Consul Lingford spluttered.“I beg of you, I beg of you, to desist.”"
"“我会赔偿办公室损坏的家具。”邓肯回答说，一面又朝着德特马的眼和鼻子上揍了几拳。","“I’ll pay the damages to office furniture,” Duncan answered, and at the same time landing more bunched knuckles on the eyes and nose of Dettmar."
"林富德领事在混乱中上蹿下跳，活像只落汤鸡，而他办公室里的家具则变为一片废墟。有一次他抓住了邓肯的胳膊，却被甩到了后边，甩出了半个屋子那么远，还气喘吁吁地。还有一次他恳求明妮。","Consul Lingford bobbed around in the turmoil like a wet hen, while his office furniture went to ruin.Once, he caught Duncan by the arm, but was flung back, gasping, half-across the room.Another time he appealed to Minnie."
"“邓肯夫人，您能不能，请您，请您，阻止您丈夫？”","“Mrs. Duncan, won’t you, please, please, restrain your husband?”"
"她虽然脸色苍白，身体颤抖，但坚决地摇了摇头，目不转睛地看着他们打架。","But she, white-faced and trembling, resolutely shook her head and watched the fray with all her eyes."
"“太残暴了。”林富德领事一边叫喊，一边闪躲着激战着的两个人，“这是对政府的公然侮辱，对美国政府的公然侮辱。不可原谅，我警告你们。哦，求您停下来，邓肯先生。您会杀死他的。我恳求您。我求求您，求求您……”","“It is outrageous,” Consul Lingford cried, dodging the hurtling bodies of the two men.“It is an affront to the Government, to the United States Government.Nor will it be overlooked, I warn you.Oh, do pray desist, Mr. Duncan.You will kill the man.I beg of you.I beg, I beg…”"
"然而，盛满了深红色芙蓉花的高花瓶一碎，他什么也说不出来了。","But the crash of a tall vase filled with crimson hibiscus blossoms left him speechless."
"德特马船长站不起来了。他用手和膝盖挣扎着站起来，但又瘫倒在地上。邓肯用脚踢了踢呻吟着的德特马。","The time came when Captain Dettmar could no longer get up.He got as far as hands and knees, struggled vainly to rise further, then collapsed.Duncan stirred the groaning wreck with his foot."
"“他没事。”他说，“我只是像他经常对待水手那样对他罢了，他待他们还要更糟。”","“He’s all right,” he announced.“I’ve only given him what he has given many a sailor and worse.”"
"“天啊，先生！”林富德领事气冲冲地说，惊恐地瞪着这个他曾邀请共进晚餐的男人。","“Great heavens, sir!”Consul Lingford exploded, staring horror-stricken at the man whom he had invited to lunch."
"邓肯不由地咯咯笑了起来，然后又克制住了自己。","Duncan giggled involuntarily, then controlled himself."
"“我道歉，林富德先生，我由衷地表达歉意。恐怕我刚才稍稍有点失去理智了。”","“I apologize, Mr. Lingford, I most heartily apologize.I fear I was slightly carried away by my feelings.”"
"林富德领事喘着气，沉默着挥了挥手臂。","Consul Lingford gulped and sawed the air speechlessly with his arms."
"“稍稍有点，先生？稍稍有点？”他终于说出话来了。","“Slightly, sir?Slightly?” he managed to articulate."
"“博伊德。”明妮温柔地从门口叫他。","“Boyd,” Minnie called softly from the doorway."
"他转过头来看。","He turned and looked."
"“你真是大快人心。”她说。","“You ARE a joy,” she said."
"“现在，林富德先生，我跟他了结了。”邓肯说，“剩下的就交给您和法律了。”","“And now, Mr. Lingford, I am done with him,” Duncan said.“I turn over what is left to you and the law.”"
"“那人？”林富德领事战战兢兢地问。","“That?”Consul Lingford queried, in accent of horror."
"“那人。”博伊德·邓肯回答说，悲伤地看着自己伤痕累累的指节。","“That,” Boyd Duncan replied, looking ruefully at his battered knuckles."
