"神秘的杰作","The Hidden Masterpiece"
"第一章","CHAPTER I"
"岁末将至。一六一二年十二月，在一个寒冷的清晨，一位衣着寒酸的年轻人站在巴黎大奥古斯丁街的一座房子门前。就像害怕接近情人一般——不管那情人是多么温顺——他徘徊良久，才跨进门槛，询问弗朗索瓦·波尔比斯先生是否在家。从一位正在打扫一间矮屋的老妇人那里得到肯定回答之后，年轻人就慢慢地走上楼梯。他犹犹豫豫，走走停停，就像一个初入朝廷，疑惑着国王将如何接待自己的臣子一样。","On a cold morning in December, towards the close of the year 1612, a young man, whose clothing betrayed his poverty, was standing before the door of a house in the Rue des Grands-Augustine, in Paris.After walking to and fro for some time with the hesitation of a lover who fears to approach his mistress, however complying she may be, he ended by crossing the threshold and asking if Maitre Francois Porbus were within.At the affirmative answer of an old woman who was sweeping out one of the lower rooms the young man slowly mounted the stairway, stopping from time to time and hesitating, like a newly fledged courier doubtful as to what sort of reception the king might grant him."
"他到了旋梯上侧的平台，犹豫了片刻，才握住装饰着画室大门的奇特门环。在这里，创作《亨利四世》的著名画家可能正在工作。这位画家因为吕本斯的缘故而被玛丽•德美第奇所冷落（注：吕本斯是17世纪著名的比利时画家；玛丽•德美第奇是法国国王亨利四世的王后）。这位年轻人深深地体会到那些风华正茂、钟情于艺术的伟大艺术家走近一位天才人物或者一幅杰作时的震撼心情。可以说，崇高的热情存在于人的一切情感中，这种热情所孕育的宛若初生的花朵。可是这花朵却会年复一年地凋零、褪色，直到快乐成为回忆，荣耀成为泡影。在这些转瞬即逝的情感当中，没有什么比得上艺术家年轻的激情。这些艺术家刚刚开始体验命中注定的荣耀和苦难，他们的激情大胆又羞怯，充满了懵懂的信心和必然的失落。哪一个财力微薄、才华初显的人在走近艺术大师时不会心跳加速？如果有这样一个人，那么这个人的画笔下将永远缺少某种扣人心弦、感人肺腑的，某种我无可名状的力量，他的创作里将永远缺少某种特质，诗作里将永远缺乏某种情感。当那些自鸣得意、自我欣赏的吹牛者预支着本属于未来成就的荣誉时，只有蠢人才把他们看作天才。如果才能是用涉世未深的羞怯，用难以描状的谦逊来衡量的话，这个不知名的青年应该算是具备了真正的价值。那些为荣耀而生的人在他们的艺术实践里失去了这种羞怯和谦逊，就像漂亮女人在卖弄风情的伎俩里失去了这些一样。习惯成功会增加信心，而谦逊或许就意味着信心不足。","When he reached the upper landing of the spiral ascent, he paused a moment before laying hold of a grotesque knocker which ornamented the door of the atelier where the famous painter of Henry IV—neglected by Marie de Medicis for Rubens—was probably at work.The young man felt the strong sensation which vibrates in the soul of great artists when, in the flush of youth and of their ardor for art, they approach a man of genius or a masterpiece.In all human sentiments there are, as it were, primeval flowers bred of noble enthusiasms, which droop and fade from year to year, till joy is but a memory and glory a lie.Amid such fleeting emotions nothing so resembles love as the young passion of an artist who tastes the first delicious anguish of his destined fame and woe,—a passion daring yet timid, full of vague confidence and sure discouragement.Is there a man, slender in fortune, rich in his spring-time of genius, whose heart has not beaten loudly as he approached a master of his art?If there be, that man will forever lack some heart-string, some touch, I know not what, of his brush, some fibre in his creations, some sentiment in his poetry.When braggarts, self-satisfied and in love with themselves, step early into the fame which belongs rightly to their future achievements, they are men of genius only in the eyes of fools.If talent is to be measured by youthful shyness, by that indefinable modesty which men born to glory lose in the practice of their art, as a pretty woman loses hers among the artifices of coquetry, then this unknown young man might claim to be possessed of genuine merit.The habit of success lessens doubt; and modesty, perhaps, is doubt."
"这位被贫穷和挫折折腾得精疲力竭的年轻人此刻正为自己的鲁莽而焦虑不安。如果他没有得到命运的意外帮助，这位新手或许还不敢走进我们景仰的《亨利四世》肖像画作者的画室。这时，一位老人走上了旋梯。老人那奇特的服装，华丽的褶裥蕾丝花边和那坚实的、从容不迫的步伐使年轻人猜想这个不同寻常的人必定是画家的顾客,或者至少也是那个画家的密友。他退回到楼梯平台的一角，给这位后来者让路，并专注地看着他，希望从他身上看到直率的优秀艺术品质，或者看到艺术推崇者乐善好施的性情。可正相反，他从这位老人的脸上看到的是某种邪恶的表情——这种表情难以言状，其特征对艺术家很有诱惑力。","Worn down with poverty and discouragement, and dismayed at this moment by his own presumption, the young neophyte might not have dared to enter the presence of the master to whom we owe our admirable portrait of Henry IV., if chance had not thrown an unexpected assistance in his way.An old man mounted the spiral stairway.The oddity of his dress, the magnificence of his lace ruffles, the solid assurance of his deliberate step, led the youth to assume that this remarkable personage must be the patron, or at least the intimate friend, of the painter.He drew back into a corner of the landing and made room for the new-comer; looking at him attentively and hoping to find either the frank good-nature of the artistic temperament, or the serviceable disposition of those who promote the arts.But on the contrary he fancied he saw something diabolical in the expression of the old man’s face,—something, I know not what, which has the quality of alluring the artistic mind."
"想象一下：一个秃头，饱满、前突的额头在扁平的小鼻子上投下深深的影子，鼻尖还像拉伯雷和苏格拉底的鼻尖那样向上翘着；皱巴巴的嘴巴带着笑容；短短的下巴上显眼地蓄着尖尖的灰白胡子；或许是因为年迈，海绿色的眼睛已经暗淡，可是在珍珠般洁白的眼球的衬托下，两只瞳孔却不时地射出很吸引人的目光，时而带着怒火，时而带着激情。他脸上其他部位因为年迈，或许更是因为劳神伤身的苦思冥想而显得格外干瘪、憔悴。他的睫毛已经掉光了，眉毛稀疏地分布在突出的眉骨上。想象一下，这样一个脑袋长在如此单薄而虚弱的身体上，嵌在雪白耀眼的煎鱼锅铲状的大翻领里，黑绒上衣上还挂着一条粗大的金链子。这样你对这个怪人的外形就有了模糊的印象。楼梯平台上昏暗的光线更给这个人物涂上了一层奇异的色彩。你可能会以为静静走上楼来的是伦布兰特创作的一幅没有边框的油画，周身带着一种诡秘的气氛，而这种诡秘的气氛正是这位大师的特色所在。老人用锐利的目光扫了一眼年轻人，然后在门上叩了三下。开门的是一个看似已过不惑之年、身体虚弱的男人。老人说道：“早上好，先生。”","Imagine a bald head, the brow full and prominent and falling with deep projection over a little flattened nose turned up at the end like the noses of Rabelais and Socrates; a laughing, wrinkled mouth; a short chin boldly chiselled and garnished with a gray beard cut into a point; sea-green eyes, faded perhaps by age, but whose pupils, contrasting with the pearl-white balls on which they floated, cast at times magnetic glances of anger or enthusiasm.The face in other respects was singularly withered and worn by the weariness of old age, and still more, it would seem, by the action of thoughts which had undermined both soul and body.The eyes had lost their lashes, and the eyebrows were scarcely traced along the projecting arches where they belonged.Imagine such a head upon a lean and feeble body, surround it with lace of dazzling whiteness worked in meshes like a fish-slice, festoon the black velvet doublet of the old man with a heavy gold chain, and you will have a faint idea of the exterior of this strange individual, to whose appearance the dusky light of the landing lent fantastic coloring.You might have thought that a canvas of Rembrandt without its frame had walked silently up the stairway, bringing with it the dark atmosphere which was the sign-manual of the great master.The old man cast a look upon the youth which was full of sagacity; then he rapped three times upon the door, and said, when it was opened by a man in feeble health, apparently about forty years of age, “Good-morning, maitre.”"
"波尔比斯恭敬鞠了一躬，并为来客让路。他觉得年轻人是随老人来的，便将他也让进画室，就没再多留意。而这位天赋异禀的新手平生第一次置身于堆满绘画材料和工具的画室，就像着了魔似的定住了，这更让主人不再留意他了。日光从屋顶的天窗泻进来，仿佛聚焦在屋子中央一台画架的画布上,上面还只画了三四根白色的线条。聚焦的光线没有照到大画室那昏暗的角落。但是，几缕散开的反射光线还是透过褐色的阴影，照在挂在墙上的十四世纪银色骑士胸甲上，清晰地照亮了摆放着珍奇瓷器的古式上蜡雕花碗橱的顶沿，又星星点点地洒在几条老式的、质地粗糙的金丝锦缎大褶窗帘上，窗帘散放在屋子里，作画画时的衣饰用。人体石膏模型和古代女神完整或残缺的裸身雕像一起拥挤地堆放在隔板和架子上，几个世纪的风吹雨打已经将它们打磨得十分光滑。从地板到天花板的墙面上到处是三色铅笔、油墨和红粉笔画的画稿和习作，多得数不胜数；遍地是颜料盒、油画颜料瓶和松节油瓶，画架和凳子有的颠三倒四，有的互相垂直，只留下一条狭窄的通道通向天窗下的亮处，光线刚好投在波尔比斯苍白的面孔和古怪来访者象牙色的脑壳上。","Porbus bowed respectfully, and made way for his guest, allowing the youth to pass in at the same time, under the impression that he came with the old man, and taking no further notice of him; all the less perhaps because the neophyte stood still beneath the spell which holds a heaven-born painter as he sees for the first time an atelier filled with the materials and instruments of his art.Daylight came from a casement in the roof and fell, focused as it were, upon a canvas which rested on an easel in the middle of the room, and which bore, as yet, only three or four chalk lines.The light thus concentrated did not reach the dark angles of the vast atelier; but a few wandering reflections gleamed through the russet shadows on the silvered breastplate of a horseman’s cuirass of the fourteenth century as it hung from the wall, or sent sharp lines of light upon the carved and polished cornice of a dresser which held specimens of rare pottery and porcelains, or touched with sparkling points the rough-grained texture of ancient gold-brocaded curtains, flung in broad folds about the room to serve the painter as models for his drapery.Anatomical casts in plaster, fragments and torsos of antique goddesses amorously polished by the kisses of centuries, jostled each other upon shelves and brackets.Innumerable sketches, studies in the three crayons, in ink, and in red chalk covered the walls from floor to ceiling; color-boxes, bottles of oil and turpentine, easels and stools upset or standing at right angles, left but a narrow pathway to the circle of light thrown from the window in the roof, which fell full on the pale face of Porbus and on the ivory skull of his singular visitor."
"年轻人全神贯注地盯着一幅画，这幅画在经历过那段动荡和革命的日子后，注定要闻名于世。而且即便在那时，某些顽固分子也认为它很珍贵。在那黑暗的日子里，艺术处于危险之中。多亏这些顽固分子的保存，这张神圣的灵感之作才得以流传至今。这幅珍贵的油画描绘了正准备付船费的埃及的玛利亚。这是一幅杰作，为玛丽·德美第奇而画，后来她在困难时期把它卖给了别人。","The attention of the young man was taken exclusively by a picture destined to become famous after those days of tumult and revolution, and which even then was precious in the sight of certain opinionated individuals to whom we owe the preservation of the divine afflatus through the dark days when the life of art was in jeopardy.This noble picture represents the Mary of Egypt as she prepares to pay for her passage by the ship.It is a masterpiece, painted for Marie de Medicis, and afterwards sold by her in the days of her distress."
"“我喜欢你画的圣女像。” 老人对波尔比斯说道，“我出的价比王后出的高出十个金克朗，但是要和她去竞争——去死吧！”","“I like your saint,” said the old man to Porbus, “and I will give you ten golden crowns over and above the queen’s offer; but as to entering into competition with her—the devil!”"
"“那么，你真的喜欢这幅画？”","“You do like her, then?”"
"“至于那个嘛，”老人说，“可以说喜欢，也可以说不喜欢。”这个好女人画得不错，但是——她不逼真。你们这些年轻人以为自己完全按照人的形体画，什么都符合解剖学原理就算好了。你们以为先在调色板上调好肌肤的颜色，小心翼翼地为脸部一侧打上阴影，时不时地看一下站在桌上的裸体模特，就算复制实物了，幻想自己就是画家了，就以为自己已经获得上帝造物的秘密了！不!——要成为一位伟大的诗人，仅知道句法规则、不犯语法错误是远远不够的。波尔比斯，看看你画的圣女。第一眼看上去令人赞叹，但紧接着再看一眼，我们就发现她是被粘在画布上的，没有立体感。她只是个剪影，只有一面和一个粗略的轮廓，既无法转动也无法移动位置。我感觉不到这条手臂和画面背景之间的空气。距离和景深也不够。只有远景不错，充分注意到了景色的渐变。可是，虽然你用心良苦，我还是不能从这美丽的身体上感受到温热的气息。如果我把手放在那坚实圆润的颈部，我只会觉得它如大理石般冰凉！不，不，我的朋友，那象牙色的皮肤下面没有血液在流动，也没有紫红色的血浆来把血管膨胀起来，像琥珀一样半透明的两鬓和胸脯下也没有网状的毛细血管在颤动。这部分鲜活，那部分却没有生气，处处都是生死交结。这儿看起来像个女人，那儿像座雕塑，再看这儿，又像具死尸。你的创作是不完整的。在你这部受人喜爱的作品里，你并没有倾注全部心力。普罗米修斯的火炬在你手中一次又一次地熄灭。你画中有几个部分从没有受过天火的照耀。”","“As for that,” said the old man, “yes, and no.The good woman is well set-up, but—she is not living.You young men think you have done all when you have drawn the form correctly, and put everything in place according to the laws of anatomy.You color the features with flesh-tones, mixed beforehand on your palette,—taking very good care to shade one side of the face darker than the other; and because you draw now and then from a nude woman standing on a table, you think you can copy nature; you fancy yourselves painters, and imagine that you have got at the secret of God’s creations!Pr-r-r-r!—To be a great poet it is not enough to know the rules of syntax and write faultless grammar.Look at your saint, Porbus.At first sight she is admirable; but at the very next glance we perceive that she is glued to the canvas, and that we cannot walk round her.She is a silhouette with only one side, a semblance cut in outline, an image that can’t turn nor change her position.I feel no air between this arm and the background of the picture; space and depth are wanting.All is in good perspective; the atmospheric gradations are carefully observed, and yet in spite of your conscientious labor I cannot believe that this beautiful body has the warm breath of life.If I put my hand on that firm, round throat I shall find it cold as marble.No, no, my friend, blood does not run beneath that ivory skin; the purple tide of life does not swell those veins, nor stir those fibres which interlace like network below the translucent amber of the brow and breast.This part palpitates with life, but that other part is not living; life and death jostle each other in every detail.Here, you have a woman; there, a statue; here again, a dead body.Your creation is incomplete.You have breathed only a part of your soul into the well-beloved work.The torch of Prometheus went out in your hands over and over again; there are several parts of your painting on which the celestial flame never shone.”"
"“但是为什么会这样呢，我亲爱的大师？”波尔比斯恭敬地问道。然而，年轻人却难以抑制住一阵强烈的冲动，想揍这位批评者一顿。","“But why is it so, my dear master?” said Porbus humbly, while the young man could hardly restrain a strong desire to strike the critic."
"“啊！就是这个问题。”这个小个子老人答道，“你在两种方法之间犹豫不决——是素描还是色彩？是荷兰古典大师们的恬淡细腻、真实刚劲，还是意大利画家的热情洋溢、欢欣喜悦？你一边想模仿汉斯·霍尔拜因和提香，同时又想模仿阿尔布雷希特·丢勒和保罗•韦罗内兹。好的，好的！你有雄心壮志！但是，结果又怎么样呢？你既没有写实手法那不苟言笑的魅力，也没有明暗法那以假乱真的魔法。看吧！在这部分，提香那丰富、清晰的色彩冲淡了阿尔布雷希特·丢勒的头骨轮廓，这就像铜水会在脆弱的铸模里爆裂，溢出一样。在画面各处，轮廓都在阻挡着色彩的狂潮，抑制着威尼斯色调的滔天洪流。你这幅画像的颜色和线条都不完美，充满了不该有的犹豫不决的痕迹。只要你没有感觉自己的天赋之火足够炽热，足以把两种对立的绘画技巧融为一体，你就应该老实地选择其中一种让风格保持一致，这样至少可以从一个方面描绘出生机。就现在这样而言，你的画只有中间面比较真实。你画的轮廓不真实。它们不会表达自我，也没有体现任何深意。这里比较真实。”老人说道，并指指圣女的胸部，“还有这里。”他指着肩端和背景相接处的一点。“但是那儿，”他又指回颈部，“完全没有真实感。不要追问为什么或怎么了。否则我会让你沮丧不已的。”","“Ah! that is the question,” said the little old man.“You are floating between two systems,—between drawing and color, between the patient phlegm and honest stiffness of the old Dutch masters and the dazzling warmth and abounding joy of the Italians.You have tried to follow, at one and the same time, Hans Holbein and Titian; Albrecht Durier and Paul Veronese.Well, well!it was a glorious ambition, but what is the result?You have neither the stern attraction of severity nor the deceptive magic of the chiaroscuro.See! at this place the rich, clear color of Titian has forced out the skeleton outline of Albrecht Durier, as molten bronze might burst and overflow a slender mould.Here and there the outline has resisted the flood, and holds back the magnificent torrent of Venetian color.Your figure is neither perfectly well painted nor perfectly well drawn; it bears throughout the signs of this unfortunate indecision.If you did not feel that the fire of your genius was hot enough to weld into one the rival methods, you ought to have chosen honestly the one or the other, and thus attained the unity which conveys one aspect, at least, of life.As it is, you are true only on your middle plane.Your outlines are false; they do not round upon themselves; they suggest nothing behind them.There is truth here,” said the old man, pointing to the bosom of the saint; “and here,” showing the spot where the shoulder ended against the background; “but there,” he added, returning to the throat, “it is all false.Do not inquire into the why and wherefore.I should fill you with despair.”"
"老人坐在凳子上，两手托腮，沉默了一会儿。","The old man sat down on a stool and held his head in his hands for some minutes in silence."
"“大师，”波尔比斯终于说道，“我研究过裸体模特的颈部，但是很遗憾，自然中的某些效果放到画布上就变得不真实了，有的根本无法画出来。”","“Master,” said Porbus at length, “I studied that throat from the nude; but, to our sorrow, there are effects in nature which become false or impossible when placed on canvas.”"
"“艺术的使命不是复制自然而是再现自然。你不是一个可悲的复制者，而是一位诗人。”老人吼道，急忙做了个手势，打断了波尔比斯的话。“假若不是这样，雕塑家仅仅通过铸模女人就可以达到艺术的巅峰了。试着为你的情人铸一个手模，然后看看做出来的是什么？——是可怕的指节，跟她鲜活的手没有一点相似之处。你必须求助于这样一位雕塑家的雕刀，他不用刻意照搬手的样式就能赋予雕像动感和生气。抓住事物和人物的思想、灵魂和表情，是我们的使命。”效果！效果！效果是什么？只不过是生命的表现，而不是生命本身。一只手——我继续用它举例——一只手不仅仅是躯体的一部分，远远不是。它表达和承载了我们必须抓住和体现的思想。画家不能，诗人和雕塑家也不能把因果分开，因为因和果是不可分割的。艺术真正追求的也就是这一点。许多画家凭借天赋取得了成功，并未将这种艺术理论当作一种理论。","“The mission of art is not to copy nature, but to represent it.You are not an abject copyist, but a poet,” cried the old man, hastily interrupting Porbus with a despotic gesture.“If it were not so, a sculptor could reach the height of his art by merely moulding a woman.Try to mould the hand of your mistress, and see what you will get,—ghastly articulations, without the slightest resemblance to her living hand; you must have recourse to the chisel of a man who, without servilely copying that hand, can give it movement and life.It is our mission to seize the mind, soul, countenance of things and beings.Effects!Effects!what are they?the mere accidents of the life, and not the life itself.A hand,—since I have taken that as an example,—a hand is not merely a part of the body, it is far more; it expresses and carries on a thought which we must seize and render.Neither the painter nor the poet nor the sculptor should separate the effect from the cause, for they are indissolubly one.The true struggle of art lies there.Many a painter has triumphed through instinct without knowing this theory of art as a theory."
"“是的，”老人激动地继续说道，“你画了一个女人，但却没有‘洞悉’她。这样是没法了解大自然的奥秘的。你们没有经过大脑思考，就下笔复制着大师的作品。你们既没有找到形式的奥妙，也没有投入足够的热情和毅力来遵循形体的发展和变化的规律。美是庄重而严肃的，而用那种方法是无法实现美的。在美屈服于我们之前，我们必须等待、留心时机并紧紧地把握它。形体比普罗蒂厄斯更加难以捕捉，比寓言中的普罗蒂厄斯更善于两面三刀，更善于逃避。只有付出艰苦的斗争，我们才能迫使它露出原形。你们年轻人只满足于获得的第一印象，或者，至多满足于第二或第三印象。这可不是杰出的艺术勇士的精神——他们拥有不可战胜的力量，不会被那些虚无的东西所误导，而是一如既往地前进，直到迫使大自然露出赤裸、真实的一面。那是拉斐尔的方法。”老人边说边伸手摘下他的丝绒帽以示对艺术之尊的敬意。“拉斐尔之所以高超是因为画中人物的内涵似乎要打破它们外在的形态。形体之于我们就像形体之于他一样——是一种思想交流、情感交流、感受交流的媒介。简而言之，形体是生命的无尽诗篇。每个人物都是一个世界。对于一幅肖像画来说，画的原型就像高大的幻象浮现在我们面前，七彩的光线为它着色，内在的心声用告诫为它勾画形状，一只神圣的手指基于既定的形象指出这原型全部的经历，让它一览无遗。你们给画中的女人披上娇嫩的肌肤和漂亮的头发，但是，能让心灵激动或宁静的血液在哪儿？你们称之为‘效果’的原因又在哪儿？你画的圣女是位皮肤黝黑的女人。但是这幅画，我可怜的波尔比斯，却描绘了一位肤色白皙的女人。你呈现出来的人物苍白无力，就如上了颜色的幽灵。这就是你们所谓的绘画！就是你们所谓的艺术！由于你们画的东西看起来更像女人而不是房屋，你们就以为达到了绘画的顶峰。你们为不必在画框上标注“美丽的马车”或“漂亮的男子”而自豪，以为自己也是杰出的画家，可以和我们伟大的前辈比肩了。哈哈！你们还差得远呢，年轻人，你们还需要用掉许多画笔，画烂许多画布才能达到那个高度。毋庸置疑，女人的头是这种姿态，裙子也是那个样子。她眼睛低垂，流露出温顺的柔情，睫毛的阴影恰好落在脸颊上。是那样，但又不是那样。究竟缺了什么？就缺一丁点，但这缺的一丁点就是全部。你们画出了生命的影像，却没有画出生命的饱满、生命的存在、生命的——我不知道是什么——也许是灵魂，它虚幻地漂浮在肉体这个皮囊之上。简而言之，它就是提香和拉斐尔采摘的生命之花。从你们现在的高度出发，或许你们也能画出一幅有价值的画来，但是你们很快就会厌倦。平庸之人会赞美你们的画，真正的艺术家却只会付之一笑。哦，玛比斯！我的绘画大师！”这个怪人接着说：“你是贼，你的生命、你的知识、你的艺术都是从我们这儿偷走的！但至少，”他停顿了一下又说：“这幅画比那个无赖吕本斯的画好得多。他画里尽是一群群佛兰德人的朱红色肉体，尽是瀑布般的红发，尽是乱糟糟的颜色。不管怎样，你的画拥有构图、色彩和情感——这是艺术的三个基本要素。”","“Yes,” continued the old man vehemently, “you draw a woman, but you do not SEE her.That is not the way to force an entrance into the arcana of Nature.Your hand reproduces, without an action of your mind, the model you copied under a master.You do not search out the secrets of form, nor follow its windings and evolutions with enough love and perseverance.Beauty is solemn and severe, and cannot be attained in that way; we must wait and watch its times and seasons, and clasp it firmly ere it yields to us.Form is a Proteus less easily captured, more skilful to double and escape, than the Proteus of fable; it is only at the cost of struggle that we compel it to come forth in its true aspects.You young men are content with the first glimpse you get of it; or, at any rate, with the second or the third.This is not the spirit of the great warriors of art,—invincible powers, not misled by will-o’-the-wisps, but advancing always until they force Nature to lie bare in her divine integrity.That was Raphael’s method,” said the old man, lifting his velvet cap in homage to the sovereign of art; “his superiority came from the inward essence which seems to break from the inner to the outer of his figures.Form with him was what it is with us,—a medium by which to communicate ideas, sensations, feelings; in short, the infinite poesy of being.Every figure is a world; a portrait, whose original stands forth like a sublime vision, colored with the rainbow tints of light, drawn by the monitions of an inward voice, laid bare by a divine finger which points to the past of its whole existence as the source of its given expression.You clothe your women with delicate skins and glorious draperies of hair, but where is the blood which begets the passion or the peace of their souls, and is the cause of what you call ‘effects’?Your saint is a dark woman; but this, my poor Porbus, belongs to a fair one.Your figures are pale, colored phantoms, which you present to our eyes; and you call that painting! art!Because you make something which looks more like a woman than a house, you think you have touched the goal; proud of not being obliged to write “currus venustus” or “pulcher homo” on the frame of your picture, you think yourselves majestic artists like our great forefathers.Ha, ha!you have not got there yet, my little men; you will use up many a crayon and spoil many a canvas before you reach that height.Undoubtedly a woman carries her head this way and her petticoats that way; her eyes soften and droop with just that look of resigned gentleness; the throbbing shadow of the eyelashes falls exactly thus upon her cheek.That is it, and—that is NOT IT.What lacks?A mere nothing; but that mere nothing is ALL.You have given the shadow of life, but you have not given its fulness, its being, its—I know not what—soul, perhaps, which floats vaporously about the tabernacle of flesh; in short, that flower of life which Raphael and Titian culled.Start from the point you have now attained, and perhaps you may yet paint a worthy picture; you grew weary too soon.Mediocrity will extol your work; but the true artist smiles.O Mabuse!O my master!” added this singular person, “you were a thief; you have robbed us of your life, your knowledge, your art!But at least,” he resumed after a pause, “this picture is better than the paintings of that rascally Rubens, with his mountains of Flemish flesh daubed with vermilion, his cascades of red hair, and his hurly-burly of color.At any rate, you have got the elements of color, drawing, and sentiment,—the three essential parts of art.”"
"“可是先生，这幅圣女像真是令人赞叹！”年轻人从沉思中回过神来，大声说道，“这些人物，这个圣女和这个船夫具有意大利画家所没有的精妙。我从未发现他们当中有谁能创作出船夫这种迟疑的神情。”","“But the saint is sublime, good sir!” cried the young man in a loud voice, waking from a deep reverie.“These figures, the saint and the boatman, have a subtile meaning which the Italian painters cannot give.I do not know one of them who could have invented that hesitation of the boatman.”"
"“这年轻小伙子是和您一起的吗？”波尔比斯问老人。","“Does the young fellow belong to you?” asked Porbus of the old man."
"“哎呀，大师，请原谅我的冒失。”这个新手红着脸说，“我是个无名小卒，只是天生爱好涂涂画画。我刚来到巴黎这个艺术和科学的源泉。","“Alas, maitre, forgive my boldness,” said the neophyte, blushing.“I am all unknown; only a dauber by instinct.I have just come to Paris, that fountain of art and science.”"
"“让我们看看你会些什么。”说着，波尔比斯递给他一张纸和一支红蜡笔。","“Let us see what you can do,” said Porbus, giving him a red crayon and a piece of paper."
"这位不知名的画家用他娴熟的手法把圣女像临摹了下来。","The unknown copied the saint with an easy turn of his hand."
"“噢！”老人惊叫道，“你叫什么名字？”","“Oh! oh!” exclaimed the old man, “what is your name?”"
"这个年轻人在画上写下自己的名字：尼古拉斯·普桑。","The youth signed the drawing: Nicolas Poussin."
"“对于一个初学者来说这算不错了。”这个刚发表了一番狂烈批评的怪人说，“我看在你面前谈论艺术是值得的。我不怪你赞美波尔比斯的圣女画。一般而言，世人会认为它是一幅杰作，但只有那些揭开了至圣奥秘的面纱的人才能发觉它的不足之处。你值得我进行一番教诲，也有领悟的能力。我来给你演示怎么添上寥寥几笔就能使这幅画成为真正的杰作。你要目不转睛、全神贯注，得到我的指导可是千载难逢的好机会。波尔比斯，把你的调色板拿来。”","“Not bad for a beginner,” said the strange being who had discoursed so wildly.“I see that it is worth while to talk art before you.I don’t blame you for admiring Porbus’s saint.It is a masterpiece for the world at large; only those who are behind the veil of the holy of holies can perceive its errors.But you are worthy of a lesson, and capable of understanding it.I will show you how little is needed to turn that picture into a true masterpiece.Give all your eyes and all your attention; such a chance of instruction may never fall in your way again.Your palette, Porbus.”"
"波尔比斯取来他的调色板和画笔。这个老人猛地卷起袖子，大拇指滑过五颜六色的调色板，拿过，不，是夺过波尔比斯递给他的一大把画笔。这么一来，他尖尖的山羊胡子仿佛随着他那无法抑制的激情颤动起来。他一边把画笔蘸满颜料，一边小声咕哝：——","Porbus fetched his palette and brushes.The little old man turned up his cuffs with convulsive haste, slipped his thumb through the palette charged with prismatic colors, and snatched, rather than took, the handful of brushes which Porbus held out to him.As he did so his beard, cut to a point, seemed to quiver with the eagerness of an incontinent fancy; and while he filled his brush he muttered between his teeth:—"
"“这些颜料粗糙、伪劣、让人恶心，应该同研磨它们的人一块儿从窗户给扔出去！这怎么能用来画画！”","“Colors fit to fling out of the window with the man who ground them,—crude, false, revolting!who can paint with them?”"
"然后他飞快地把笔尖在各种颜料里蘸了一下，速度比复活节时大教堂里演奏整首《圣子颂》的风琴师的速度还要快。","Then he dipped the point of his brush with feverish haste into the various tints, running through the whole scale with more rapidity than the organist of a cathedral runs up the gamut of the “O Filii” at Easter."
"波尔比斯和普桑一动不动地站在画架两边，陷入了沉思。","Porbus and Poussin stood motionless on either side of the easel, plunged in passionate contemplation."
"“看，年轻人，”老人背对他们说道，“看我怎么用三四笔，再上点浅蓝色，就能使可怜的圣女头部周围的空气流动起来，她在这厚重的空气里一定闷坏了。看！她的衣服布料现在飘起来了，就像是微风在轻拂一样。而刚才它看起来还像是被大头针别着的厚亚麻布。注意看，我加在胸部的柔光，这让胸部变得像少女的肌肤那样丰满、柔软。原先这一大片阴影让血液看起来凝滞不动，看看红棕色和赭色混合起来是怎样让那种冷灰的色调变得热烈活泼的。年轻人啊，年轻人！我现在对你的指点是世界上其他任何大师都教不了你的。只有玛比斯才知道给形体赋予生命的秘密。但玛比斯只有一个学生，那就是我。我从来没有教过学生，而我现在已经是个老头了！你挺聪明，会知道在我今天给你少许指点之后应该怎么做。”","“See, young man,” said the old man without turning round, “see how with three or four touches and a faint bluish glaze you can make the air circulate round the head of the poor saint, who was suffocating in that thick atmosphere.Look how the drapery now floats, and you see that the breeze lifts it; just now it looked like heavy linen held out by pins.Observe that the satiny lustre I am putting on the bosom gives it the plump suppleness of the flesh of a young girl.See how this tone of mingled reddish-brown and ochre warms up the cold grayness of that large shadow where the blood seemed to stagnate rather than flow.Young man, young man!what I am showing you now no other master in the world can teach you.Mabuse alone knew the secret of giving life to form.Mabuse had but one pupil, and I am he.I never took a pupil, and I am an old man now.You are intelligent enough to guess at what should follow from the little that I shall show you today.”"
"这位不同寻常的老人一边说着，一边往画上各处添上几笔。这儿两笔，那儿一笔，但是每一笔都是如此有效。这些笔画一起让这画改头换面——仿佛在熠熠生辉。他如此充满激情地画着，豆大的汗珠从光溜溜的前额上落下来。他的动作如此迅速急促，似乎已经不受身体控制，以致年轻的普桑幻想着这个古怪的人身上一定藏有一个技艺高超的精灵，就像玩偶一样操控着他的手，无需他来左右，甚至不听他使唤。他眼中那反常的光芒，还有那似乎因为精神叛逆而痉挛的动作，好像证实了年轻人的这种猜想，仿佛正是这才激发了他生动的想象力。老人继续画着，一边喃喃低语，不知道是自言自语还是说给新手听的：——","While he was speaking, the extraordinary old man was giving touches here and there to all parts of the picture.Here two strokes of the brush, there one, but each so telling that together they brought out a new painting,—a painting steeped, as it were, in light.He worked with such passionate ardor that the sweat rolled in great drops from his bald brow; and his motions seemed to be jerked out of him with such rapidity and impatience that the young Poussin fancied a demon, encased with the body of this singular being, was working his hands fantastically like those of a puppet without, or even against, the will of their owner.The unnatural brightness of his eyes, the convulsive movements which seemed the result of some mental resistance, gave to this fancy of the youth a semblance of truth which reacted upon his lively imagination.The old man worked on, muttering half to himself, half to his neophyte:—"
"“啪！啪！啪！年轻人，看我是怎么上色的。啊！我轻轻的笔触，没错，让那块冰冷的色调温暖起来。来吧，来吧！——砰！砰！砰！”他继续画着，对几处他抱怨过缺少生机的地方进行润色修改，层层颜色掩盖了原先两种画法的不协调，色调也重归一致——这是塑造出热情的埃及圣女的关键。","“Paf! paf! paf! that is how we butter it on, young man.Ah! my little pats, you are right; warm up that icy tone.Come, come!—pon, pon, pon,—” he continued, touching up the spots where he had complained of a lack of life, hiding under layers of color the conflicting methods, and regaining the unity of tone essential to an ardent Egyptian."
"“现在，看见了吧，我的年轻朋友，最后几笔才是点睛之笔。波尔比斯画了上百笔，而我只画了一两笔。如果没有展现背后的东西，就没人会感谢我们，记住这点吧！”","“Now see, my little friend, it is only the last touches of the brush that count for anything.Porbus put on a hundred; I have only put on one or two.Nobody will thank us for what is underneath, remember that!”"
"技艺高超的精灵终于停了下来；老人转向佩服得哑口无言的波尔比斯和普桑，说道：","At last the demon paused; the old man turned to Porbus and Poussin, who stood mute with admiration, and said to them,—"
"“这幅画还没法和我《漂亮的裸女》相比。不过，也配得上署名了。”“对，我要署上名字。”他接着说，一边站起来抓过一面镜子，审视着自己的杰作。“现在我们去吃早饭。你们俩都到我家来吧。我有熏火腿和上好的葡萄酒。嘿！尽管时运不济，我们仍要谈论绘画，我们自身就是强者。”他拍着尼古拉斯•普桑的肩膀继续说道：“你这小伙子，是很有才华的。”","“It is not yet equal to my Beautiful Nut-girl; still, one can put one’s name to such a work.Yes, I will sign it,” he added, rising to fetch a mirror in which to look at what he had done.“Now let us go and breakfast.Come, both of you, to my house.I have some smoked ham and good wine.Hey! hey! in spite of the degenerate times we will talk painting; we are strong ourselves.Here is a little man,” he continued, striking Nicolas Poussin on the shoulder, “who has the faculty.”"
"他注意到年轻人戴着破旧的帽子，便从腰间摘下皮钱夹，从里面掏出两枚金币递给普桑，说：——","Observing the shabby cap of the youth, he pulled from his belt a leathern purse from which he took two gold pieces and offered them to him, saying,—"
"“我把你的画买下来。”","“I buy your drawing.”"
"年轻人怔了一下，脸羞得通红，浑身颤抖着，因为这位年轻画家有着穷人的自尊。波尔比斯见他这样便对他说：“拿着吧，拿着吧。在他包里还有两个国王的赎金呢！”","“Take them,” said Porbus to Poussin, seeing that the latter trembled and blushed with shame, for the young scholar had the pride of poverty; “take them, he has the ransom of two kings in his pouch.”"
"三人离开画室，一路上边走边谈艺术，一直走到座落在圣米迦桥附近的一幢漂亮的木房子前。房子的窗棂和阿拉伯式装饰让普桑惊讶不已。这位画家胚子很快就来到一楼的一间屋子里就座，旁边生着很旺的炉火，桌上摆放着诱人的菜肴。他感到自己有着出乎意料的好运，能和两位伟大的画家在一起，他们还这么关心他。","The three left the atelier and proceeded, talking all the way of art, to a handsome wooden house standing near the Pont Saint-Michel, whose window-casings and arabesque decoration amazed Poussin.The embryo painter soon found himself in one of the rooms on the ground floor seated, beside a good fire, at a table covered with appetizing dishes, and, by unexpected good fortune, in company with two great artists who treated him with kindly attention."
"“年轻人，”波尔普斯注意到他默不作声地盯着一幅画，说道，“不要看这画太久，否则你会陷入绝望的。”","“Young man,” said Porbus, observing that he was speechless, with his eyes fixed on a picture, “do not look at that too long, or you will fall into despair.”"
"这幅画名为《亚当》，是玛比斯的作品。这位任性的天才画家被债主关在牢房里很长时间，直到创作了这幅画才被放了出去。这幅画展示出现实的饱满和力量，由此尼古拉斯•普桑开始明白老人那些晦涩难懂的话的含义了。老人看着这幅画，神情满足却并不激动，似乎在说：“我刚才画的比这还好一些。”","It was the Adam of Mabuse, painted by that wayward genius to enable him to get out of the prison where his creditors had kept him so long.The figure presented such fulness and force of reality that Nicolas Poussin began to comprehend the meaning of the bewildering talk of the old man.The latter looked at the picture with a satisfied but not enthusiastic manner, which seemed to say, “I have done better myself.”"
"“这幅画在形体上有生命力，”他评价道，“我可怜的老师在那点上超越了自我，但注意，这幅画的背景缺乏真实感。当然，人物很逼真。他似乎在起身走向我们，但我们呼吸的空气、仰望的天空、感到的环境——它们在哪儿？另外，这画仅仅塑造出了一个人的形象。而上帝亲手创造的第一个人所具有的一些神圣感并没有在这里体现出来。玛比斯头脑清醒的时候，自己也这么苦恼地说过。”","“There is life in the form,” he remarked.“My poor master surpassed himself there; but observe the want of truth in the background.The man is living, certainly; he rises and is coming towards us; but the atmosphere, the sky, the air that we breathe, see, feel,—where are they?Besides, that is only a man; and the being who came first from the hand of God must needs have had something divine about him which is lacking here.Mabuse said so himself with vexation in his sober moments.”"
"普桑怀着好奇，忐忑不安地轮番看着老人和波尔比斯。他转向波尔比斯，似乎想问主人的名字，但画家将一只手指抵在唇上，一副神秘的样子。年轻人更好奇了，但他只能保持安静，希望什么时候能从他们谈话内容中猜出老人的名字。波尔比斯对老人的尊重，加上如画的厅堂里堆满的艺术奇珍都充分证明了老人的财富和才华。","Poussin looked alternately at the old man and at Porbus with uneasy curiosity.He turned to the latter as if to ask the name of their host, but the painter laid a finger on his lips with an air of mystery, and the young man, keenly interested, kept silence, hoping that sooner or later some word of the conversation might enable him to guess the name of the old man, whose wealth and genius were sufficiently attested by the respect which Porbus showed him, and by the marvels of art heaped together in the picturesque apartment."
"普桑仔细观察着墙上的暗格里挂着的一幅华丽的女人画像，大声惊叹道：“多么漂亮的乔尔乔涅画作！”","Poussin, observing against the dark panelling of the wall a magnificent portrait of a woman, exclaimed aloud, “What a magnificent Giorgione!”"
"“不，”老人回答道，“那是我早期的涂鸦之作！”","“No,” remarked the old man, “that is only one of my early daubs.”"
"“天啊！”普桑天真地惊呼道，“您是画家之王吗？”","“Zounds!” cried Poussin naively; “are you the king of painters?”"
"老人笑了笑，似乎早已习惯了这种赞扬。“弗朗霍斐先生，”波尔比斯问道，“您能拿出您那上好的莱茵葡萄酒让我尝尝吗？”","The old man smiled, as if long accustomed to such homage.“Maitre Frenhofer,” said Porbus, “could you order up a little of your good Rhine wine for me?”"
"“两桶，”主人答道，“一桶为感谢今天早上欣赏你美丽的罪女所带来的快乐，另一桶是友谊的象征。”","“Two casks,” answered the host; “one to pay for the pleasure of looking at your pretty sinner this morning, and the other as a mark of friendship.”"
"“啊！假如我的身体没有这么虚弱，”波尔比斯又说，“假如您答应让我看看您那幅《漂亮的裸女》，我也可能画出庄严、宏大而深刻的画像，让形体鲜活生动起来。”","“Ah! if I were not so feeble,” resumed Porbus, “and if you would consent to let me see your Beautiful Nut-girl, I too could paint some lofty picture, grand and yet profound, where the forms should have the living life.”"
"“给你们看我的作品？”老人情绪激动地说，“不可以，不可以！我还需要把它画得尽善尽美。昨天天快黑时，我本来以为完工了。她的眼睛清澈，肌肤颤动，长发飘飘——她在呼吸！我本以为我懂得了在平面画布上立体而饱满地展现实物的秘诀，可是今天清晨，我发现自己错误百出。啊！为了达到那种辉煌的效果，我还深入地研究过色彩大师们的作品。我逐层解剖并分析了‘光影之王’提香的色彩作品。像他这位伟大的艺术之王一样，我用柔和的纯色、轻快的色调快速勾勒出我的人物，因为阴影只能偶尔用用——记住，年轻人。接着，我可以说是反其道而行之，先不断降低釉色的透明度，再配以灰调子，画出几乎全黑的阴影。这和普通画家笔下阴影的质地和光线的色调是有差异的。他们笔下的阴影是木头、铜、铁，随便什么，就是没有生机。我们觉得如果人物变换了位置，阴影部位就不能擦掉，而要继续保持阴暗，绝对不能加亮。许多杰出的画家都犯了这样的错误，我却没有陷入其中。在我的画作里，你可以在大片不透明的阴影中看出亮色。那些无知的人以为自己能把渐渐消失的界线画好就够了。而我却不同，我不会干瘪地描出人物的轮廓，也不会迷信人体解剖学来进行细节的刻画。我来告诉你吧，人体结构比线条要高深得多。在这方面，雕塑家比我们更能接近实物。实物是所有曲线的综合体，相互重叠交织。严格地讲，不存在绘画这回事。别笑，年轻人！无论你觉得这种说法有多古怪，总有一天你会明白其中的原因的。人用线条的方法来诠释光线作用于实物的效果，但是对于一切浑圆的物体来说，根本不存在线条这种东西。其实，我们画出来的不过是模型——换句话说，我们是把实物从背景里分离出来，用合适的立体效果来表现它们。只有把光线分布处理好才能展现整体。因为这个原因，我并没有将轮廓精确地界定出来，而是让淡淡的、温暖的灰调子像云雾般弥散在边缘周围。这就是为什么我懒得理会那些找不到轮廓与画面背景具体相交部位就大加指责的人。这种作品近看显得模糊，欠缺精细和准确。但是，走远几步看，各部分就井然有序了。它们形体自然，更为突出——身体在转动，肢体在伸展，我们能感觉到空气在他们周围流动。","“Show my work!” exclaimed the old man, with deep emotion.“No, no!I have still to bring it to perfection.Yesterday, towards evening, I thought it was finished.Her eyes were liquid, her flesh trembled, her tresses waved—she breathed!And yet, though I have grasped the secret of rendering on a flat canvas the relief and roundness of nature, this morning at dawn I saw many errors.Ah! to attain that glorious result, I have studied to their depths the masters of color.I have analyzed and lifted, layer by layer, the colors of Titian, king of light.Like him, great sovereign of art, I have sketched my figure in light clear tones of supple yet solid color; for shadow is but an accident,—remember that, young man.Then I worked backward, as it were; and by means of half-tints, and glazings whose transparency I kept diminishing little by little, I was able to cast strong shadows deepening almost to blackness.The shadows of ordinary painters are not of the same texture as their tones of light.They are wood, brass, iron, anything you please except flesh in shadow.We feel that if the figures changed position the shady places would not be wiped off, and would remain dark spots which never could be made luminous.I have avoided that blunder, though many of our most illustrious painters have fallen into it.In my work you will see whiteness beneath the opacity of the broadest shadow.Unlike the crowd of ignoramuses, who fancy they draw correctly because they can paint one good vanishing line, I have not dryly outlined my figures, nor brought out superstitiously minute anatomical details; for, let me tell you, the human body does not end off with a line.In that respect sculptors get nearer to the truth of nature than we do.Nature is all curves, each wrapping or overlapping another.To speak rigorously, there is no such thing as drawing.Do not laugh, young man; no matter how strange that saying seems to you, you will understand the reasons for it one of these days.A line is a means by which man explains to himself the effect of light upon a given object; but there is no such thing as a line in nature, where all things are rounded and full.It is only in modelling that we really draw,—in other words, that we detach things from their surroundings and put them in their due relief.The proper distribution of light can alone reveal the whole body.For this reason I do not sharply define lineaments; I diffuse about their outline a haze of warm, light half-tints, so that I defy any one to place a finger on the exact spot where the parts join the groundwork of the picture.If seen near by this sort of work has a woolly effect, and is wanting in nicety and precision; but go a few steps off and the parts fall into place; they take their proper form and detach themselves,—the body turns, the limbs stand out, we feel the air circulating around them."
"“不过，”他遗憾地继续说道，“我并不满意。我有时也会有些疑虑。或许一根线条也不画会更好。我问过自己画肖像时该不该从最亮处开始画，然后再画较暗的部分。这不正是宇宙中天赐的画家——太阳的绘画方式吗？噢，大自然，大自然！有谁曾在你的变幻中捕捉到你？哎呀！太过博学和太过无知一样都会导致怀疑。我怀疑我的作品了！”","“Nevertheless,” he continued, sadly, “I am not satisfied; there are moments when I have my doubts.Perhaps it would be better not to sketch a single line.I ask myself if I ought not to grasp the figure first by its highest lights, and then work down to the darker portions.Is not that the method of the sun, divine painter of the universe?O Nature, Nature! who has ever caught thee in thy flights?Alas! the heights of knowledge, like the depths of ignorance, lead to unbelief.I doubt my work.”"
"老人稍微停顿，然后继续道：“我已经画了十年，年轻人。但是，在和大自然漫长的较量中十年又算什么呢？我们不知道那个皮格玛利翁塑造世上唯一能走路的雕像花了多少时间——”","The old man paused, then resumed.“For ten years I have worked, young man; but what are ten short years in the long struggle with Nature?We do not know the type it cost Pygmalion to make the only statue that ever walked—”"
"他凝眸陷入沉思，完全不在意周围的一切，只是机械地玩着手里的刀子。","He fell into a reverie and remained, with fixed eyes, oblivious of all about him, playing mechanically with his knife."
"“瞧，他正同自己的灵魂说话。”波尔比斯低声说。","“See, he is talking to his own soul,” said Porbus in a low voice."
"这话像是给尼古拉斯·普桑施了魔咒，使他充满了真正的艺术家才有的无可名状的好奇心。这个眼珠洁白、凝神发呆的老人在这位惊讶的年轻人眼中已经不是凡人，而变得更像是一只住在未知之地的奇特精灵，刚刚被灵魂中稀奇古怪的想法唤醒。我们无法从精神上解释这种着魔的现象，就像我们不能用文字表达一个背井离乡的人听到一首思乡歌谣时心中的情感一样。老人对优秀艺术成果假装表现出来的轻蔑，他的财富，他的举止，波尔比斯对他恭敬的尊崇，他如此严密看管的作品——一幅苦心耕耘、毋庸置疑的天才之作（这从普桑对少女头像发自内心的崇拜中可以看出来），即使摆在玛比斯的《亚当》旁边也仍然很美。这些都彰显了伟大艺术家的神来之笔——简而言之，关于这位奇怪老人的一切都超出人性的界限。为了解开这位神人的谜团，年轻人将自己丰富的想象力集中在一条可感知的清晰线索上——艺术天性的存在。这狂放不羁的天性拥有着强大的能力。它常常会滥用这种能力，拽着冷静的理智者、普通的人，甚至还有艺术爱好者越过乱石丛生的不毛之地。对于这些人来说，那里既没有欢乐，也没有人引导，而对于艺术之魂本身——那位调皮的白翼天使——来说，一路上都催生着史诗、艺术品和想象力。这就是一种天性，一种本质，是善意的嘲讽，贫穷的富有。所以，对于热情充沛的普桑而言，这位老人突然成了艺术的化身——秘密深邃、激情四溢、充满梦想的艺术。","The words acted like a spell on Nicolas Poussin, filling him with the inexplicable curiosity of a true artist.The strange old man, with his white eyes fixed in stupor, became to the wondering youth something more than a man; he seemed a fantastic spirit inhabiting an unknown sphere, and waking by its touch confused ideas within the soul.We can no more define the moral phenomena of this species of fascination than we can render in words the emotions excited in the heart of an exile by a song which recalls his fatherland.The contempt which the old man affected to pour upon the noblest efforts of art, his wealth, his manners, the respectful deference shown to him by Porbus, his work guarded so secretly,—a work of patient toil, a work no doubt of genius, judging by the head of the Virgin which Poussin had so naively admired, and which, beautiful beside even the Adam of Mabuse, betrayed the imperial touch of a great artist,—in short, everything about the strange old man seemed beyond the limits of human nature.The rich imagination of the youth fastened upon the one perceptible and clear clew to the mystery of this supernatural being,—the presence of the artistic nature, that wild impassioned nature to which such mighty powers have been confided, which too often abuses those powers, and drags cold reason and common souls, and even lovers of art, over stony and arid places, where for such there is neither pleasure nor instruction; while to the artistic soul itself,—that white-winged angel of sportive fancy,—epics, works of art, and visions rise along the way.It is a nature, an essence, mocking yet kind, fruitful though destitute.Thus, for the enthusiastic Poussin, the old man became by sudden transfiguration Art itself,—art with all its secrets, its transports, and its dreams."
"“是的，我亲爱的波尔比斯，”弗朗霍斐还在沉思中似醒非醒，“我从未见过一个完美的女人——一个线条完美，肤色——啊！她在哪里？”他叫起来，打断了自己的话，“这个失落的古人眼中的维纳斯活在哪里,我们寻觅已久，却只能偶尔窥见她的芳容。哎！为了看一会儿，哪怕是片刻，看看这个完美的天赐尤物，我愿意放弃我所有的财富。是的，我愿不远万里把你找到，我的女神！像奥菲厄斯一样，为了赢回你这艺术的化身，就算下地狱我也在所不辞——”","“Yes, my dear Porbus,” said Frenhofer, speaking half in reverie, “I have never yet beheld a perfect woman; a body whose outlines were faultless and whose flesh-tints—Ah! where lives she?” he cried, interrupting his own words; “where lives the lost Venus of the ancients, so long sought for, whose scattered beauty we snatch by glimpses?Oh! to see for a moment, a single moment, the divine completed nature,—the ideal,—I would give my all of fortune.Yes; I would search thee out, celestial Beauty! in thy farthest sphere.Like Orpheus, I would go down to hell to win back the life of art—”"
"“我们走，”波尔比斯对普桑说道，“他现在既看不见我们也听不见我们说什么了。”","“Let us go,” said Porbus to Poussin; “he neither sees nor hears us any longer.”"
"“我们到他的画室去。”大为吃惊的年轻人说道。","“Let us go to his atelier,” said the wonder-struck young man."
"“哎呀！这个狡猾的老家伙早已派人守在画室门口。他的宝贝我们是拿不到的。不用等你来提议或是督促，我都会试着探寻这个秘密。”","“Oh! the old dragon has guarded the entrance.His treasure is out of our reach.I have not waited for your wish or urging to attempt an assault on the mystery.”"
"“秘密！那么，那儿有个秘密？”","“Mystery! then there is a mystery?”"
"“是的。” 波尔比斯答道。“弗朗霍斐是玛比斯唯一一个关门弟子。他成为了那个不幸之人的朋友、救助者和父亲，他牺牲了自己大部分财富来满足他老师那疯狂的激情。作为回报，玛比斯传授给他画出立体感的秘密以及赋予形体以活力的力量——那是自然的精髓，是我们永远也无法企及的。玛比斯把这种精髓把握得极好，以至于有一次，他把本该在欢迎查理五世入城时穿的缀花锦缎衣服卖掉换酒喝了，出场时反而穿了一件画得极像锦缎的纸衣服。这件着装的华美吸引了皇帝的注意。皇帝想赞美这个老酒鬼，就把手放在他肩上，这才发现上当了。弗朗霍斐酷爱绘画艺术，几乎走火入魔。他比其他画家站得更高，看得更远。他对颜色和线条的绝对真实感进行过深刻的思考。但是经过大量的研究、丰富的思考和不断的学习，他最后对自己所探寻的事物突然产生了怀疑。在他绝望时，他设想着素描是不存在的，而线条只能呈现几何轮廓。那当然不正确，因为用没有色彩的黑线条我们也能再现人物的形体。这证明我们的艺术类似于自然，是由无穷多的元素构成的。素描勾勒出骨架，色彩赋予其生命。但是没有生命的骨架却比没有骨架的生命更完整。除此之外，还有一个更高的真理——就是说，实践和观察是一个画家必备的素质。假如画具和画笔始终无法表现理性和诗意，我们就会像钟情艺术、思想不羁的弗朗霍斐一样产生怀疑。的确，他是位令人敬仰的画家，但不幸的是他出身富贵，这让他在理论与猜想之间迷失。不要学他。画吧！画吧！只有手拿画笔的画家才有资格进行理论总结。”","“Yes,” answered Porbus.“Frenhofer was the only pupil Mabuse was willing to teach.He became the friend, saviour, father of that unhappy man, and he sacrificed the greater part of his wealth to satisfy the mad passions of his master.In return, Mabuse bequeathed to him the secret of relief, the power of giving life to form,—that flower of nature, our perpetual despair, which Mabuse had seized so well that once, having sold and drunk the value of a flowered damask which he should have worn at the entrance of Charles V., he made his appearance in a paper garment painted to resemble damask.The splendor of the stuff attracted the attention of the emperor, who, wishing to compliment the old drunkard, laid a hand upon his shoulder and discovered the deception.Frenhofer is a man carried away by the passion of his art; he sees above and beyond what other painters see.He has meditated deeply on color and the absolute truth of lines; but by dint of much research, much thought, much study, he has come to doubt the object for which he is searching.In his hours of despair he fancies that drawing does not exist, and that lines can render nothing but geometric figures.That, of course, is not true; because with a black line which has no color we can represent the human form.This proves that our art is made up, like nature, of an infinite number of elements.Drawing gives the skeleton, and color gives the life; but life without the skeleton is a far more incomplete thing than the skeleton without the life.But there is a higher truth still,—namely, that practice and observation are the essentials of a painter; and that if reason and poesy persist in wrangling with the tools, the brushes, we shall be brought to doubt, like Frenhofer, who is as much excited in brain as he is exalted in art.A sublime painter, indeed; but he had the misfortune to be born rich, and that enables him to stray into theory and conjecture.Do not imitate him.Work! work! painters should theorize with their brushes in their hands.”"
"“我们要设法进入画室。”普桑大声喊道。他没听波尔比斯的话，只是想着那幅神秘的杰作。","“We will contrive to get in,” cried Poussin, not listening to Porbus, and thinking only of the hidden masterpiece."
"波尔比斯对年轻人的热情报以微笑，对他挥手作别并诚挚地邀请他下次再来拜访。","Porbus smiled at the youth’s enthusiasm, and bade him farewell with a kindly invitation to come and visit him."
"尼古拉斯·普桑慢慢地朝竖琴街往回走，走过了自己寄宿的廉价祣社也浑然不知。他很快便折回来，急匆匆地快步跑上简陋的楼梯，一直来到房子顶部的一个房间——房间处在木筋墙屋顶的托梁之间——这种不太结实的屋顶在以前的巴黎很常见。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　房间只有一扇昏暗的窗子，靠窗坐着一位年轻姑娘。门一开，她便迅速站起来，流露出浓情蜜意；她早已听出是年轻人在拨动门闩。","Nicolas Poussin returned slowly towards the Rue de la Harpe and passed, without observing that he did so, the modest hostelry where he was lodging.Returning presently upon his steps, he ran up the miserable stairway with anxious rapidity until he reached an upper chamber nestling between the joists of a roof “en colombage,”—the plain, slight covering of the houses of old Paris.Near the single and gloomy window of the room sat a young girl, who rose quickly as the door opened, with a gesture of love; she had recognized the young man’s touch upon the latch."
"“怎么啦？”她问道。","“What is the matter?” she asked."
"“是——是，”他抑制不住喜悦的心情，“我觉得自己是个画家了！之前我一直怀疑这个想法，但今天我开始相信自己了。我会成为一个伟大的人。啊！吉勒特，我们会富有的，我们会幸福的！这些画笔可以带来黄金！”","“It is—it is,” he cried, choking with joy, “that I feel myself a painter!I have doubted it till now; but today I believe in myself.I can be a great man.Ah, Gillette, we shall be rich, happy!There is gold in these brushes!”"
"突然，他又沉默了。当他把自己远大的理想和贫乏的收入相比较时，兴奋的表情便从他那严肃认真的脸上褪去了。阁楼的墙壁上贴了少许蜡笔素描，他只有四张干净画布。当时的颜料很贵，这位穷画家只有凝视几乎空空如也的画板。即使身陷穷困，他仍觉得内心充满难以形容的财富，洋溢着令人着迷的才华。他被一位熟识的绅士带到巴黎来，也可能是受自己才能的驱使而来的。他偶遇一位情人——一位有着善良和高贵灵魂的姑娘，她来到这位杰出画家的身边，随时准备着吃苦。她不嫌弃他的贫穷，学着理解他的反复无常，坚定地忍受着贫困，付出着爱情，而其他姑娘则在大胆地炫耀自己的奢华，显示自己的无知。她嘴唇上露出的微笑灿如金光，照亮了黑暗的阁楼，胜过天空的光芒。因为天空不会一直阳光灿烂，而她却永远守候在此——冷静、内敛，与他同甘共苦，用满心的爱守护他的天才，直到这份天才在艺术中找到归宿。","Suddenly he became silent.His grave and earnest face lost its expression of joy; he was comparing the immensity of his hopes with the mediocrity of his means.The walls of the garret were covered with bits of paper on which were crayon sketches; he possessed only four clean canvases.Colors were at that time costly, and the poor gentleman gazed at a palette that was well-nigh bare.In the midst of this poverty he felt within himself an indescribable wealth of heart and the superabundant force of consuming genius.Brought to Paris by a gentleman of his acquaintance, and perhaps by the monition of his own talent, he had suddenly found a mistress,—one of those generous and noble souls who are ready to suffer by the side of a great man; espousing his poverty, studying to comprehend his caprices, strong to bear deprivation and bestow love, as others are daring in the display of luxury and in parading the insensibility of their hearts.The smile which flickered on her lips brightened as with gold the darkness of the garret and rivalled the effulgence of the skies; for the sun did not always shine in the heavens, but she was always here,—calm and collected in her passion, living in his happiness, his griefs; sustaining the genius which overflowed in love ere it found in art its destined expression."
"“听着，吉勒特，来！”","“Listen, Gillette; come!”"
"乖巧快乐的姑娘轻盈地跳到画家的膝盖上。她美丽优雅、风姿绰约，如春天般可爱。她高尚的心灵迸发出的火焰照亮了一切。","The obedient, happy girl sprang lightly on the painter’s knee.She was all grace and beauty, pretty as the spring-time, decked with the wealth of feminine charm, and lighting all with the fire of a noble soul."
"“噢，上帝呀！”他高喊着，“我不能对她讲啊！”","“O God!” he exclaimed, “I can never tell her!”"
"“一个秘密嘛！”她问，“那我必须知道。”","“A secret!” she cried; “then I must know it.”"
"普桑陷入了沉思。","Poussin was lost in thought."
"“告诉我吧！”","“Tell me.”"
"“吉勒特，可怜的人，我心爱的人！”","“Gillette, poor, beloved heart!”"
"“啊！你是想要我做什么吗？”","“Ah! do you want something of me?”"
"“是的。”","“Yes.”"
"“如果你想我摆出前几天那样的姿势，”她轻轻地撅着嘴说，“我可不愿意。在那种场合，你的眼里根本没有我。你只是看着我，心里却没有想我。”","“If you want me to pose as I did the other day,” she said, with a little pouting air, “I will not do it.Your eyes say nothing to me, then.You look at me, but you do not think of me.”"
"“你愿意我去画另一个女人吗？”","“Would you like me to copy another woman?”"
"“也许吧，”她回答说，“如果她长得很丑的话。”","“Perhaps,” she answered, “if she were very ugly.”"
"“对了，”普桑以严肃的口气继续问道，“如果为了我成为杰出的画家你必须去给其他人当模特呢？”","“Well,” continued Poussin, in a grave tone, “if to make me a great painter it were necessary to pose to some one else—”"
"“你这是在考验我。” 她打断他的话，“你非常清楚，我不会那样做的。”","“You are testing me,” she interrupted; “you know well that I would not do it.”"
"普桑把头埋到胸前，像是无法忍受狂喜或大悲的人一样。","Poussin bent his head upon his breast like a man succumbing to joy or grief too great for his spirit to bear."
"“听着，”她拉着普桑那破旧的紧身上衣的袖子说，“我告诉过你，尼克，我愿为你献出我的生命，但是我从没说过——从来没有！——在我活着的时候就放弃我的爱情。”","“Listen,” she said, pulling him by the sleeve of his worn doublet, “I told you, Nick, that I would give my life for you; but I never said—never!—that I, a living woman, would renounce my love.”"
"“放弃爱情？”普桑大声喊道。","“Renounce it?” cried Poussin."
"“如果我用这样把自己展示给另一个人的话，你就不会再爱我了。而我自己也会觉得不值得你爱。啊！屈从于你的反复无常还不简单吗！满足你的愿望让我很快乐，也很骄傲。但是做别人的模特，那不可能！”","“If I showed myself thus to another you would love me no longer; and I myself, I should feel unworthy of your love.To obey your caprices, ah, that is simple and natural! in spite of myself, I am proud and happy in doing thy dear will; but to another, fy!”"
"“原谅我，我的吉勒特。”画家跪在她面前说，“我只要你爱我，不要出名。对我而言，你比财富和荣誉更珍贵。是的，让这些画笔滚一边去吧！烧掉这些素描画稿！我错了。我的使命就是去爱你——只爱你！我不是画家，我是你的情人。让艺术和它所有的秘密去死吧！”","“Forgive me, my own Gillette,” said the painter, throwing himself at her feet.“I would rather be loved than famous.To me thou art more precious than fortune and honors.Yes, away with these brushes!burn those sketches!I have been mistaken.My vocation is to love thee,—thee alone!I am not a painter, I am thy lover.Perish art and all its secrets!”"
"她仰慕地看着他，为他的激情而快乐，而入迷。她赢了；她的直觉告诉她，因为她，艺术已被他抛之脑后，像香烛的灰烬般飘落在她的脚下。","She looked at him admiringly, happy and captivated by his passion.She reigned; she felt instinctively that the arts were forgotten for her sake, and flung at her feet like grains of incense."
"“但他只是个老头。”普桑又说到，“在他眼中你只是个女人。你是他寻找的完美的女人。”","“Yet he is only an old man,” resumed Poussin.“In you he would see only a woman.You are the perfect woman whom he seeks.”"
"“爱会准许一切的！”她大声说道，准备打消对爱情的顾虑，去回报打算为了她而牺牲艺术的情人。“可是，”她补充说，“这种牺牲会毁掉我的。啊！为了你好而受苦！是啊，这多么荣耀！但是，你会忘记我。你怎么会冒出这么一个残忍的想法呀！”","“Love should grant all things!” she exclaimed, ready to sacrifice love’s scruples to reward the lover who thus seemed to sacrifice his art to her.“And yet,” she added, “it would be my ruin.Ah, to suffer for thy good!Yes, it is glorious!But thou wilt forget me.How came this cruel thought into thy mind?”"
"“它自己蹦出来的，可是我仍然爱着你。”他略带悔恨地说，“那么，我是一个无耻的家伙吗？”","“It came there, and yet I love thee,” he said, with a sort of contrition.“Am I, then, a wretch?”"
"“我们问一下阿哈迪杜安老爹吧。”","“Let us consult Pere Hardouin.”"
"“不，不！这只能是我们两个人的秘密。”","“No, no! it must be a secret between us.”"
"“好吧，我愿意去。但你一定不要在场。”她说，“呆在门口，准备好匕首。假如我喊叫，你就进去杀死那个人。”","“Well, I will go; but thou must not be present,” she said.“Stay at the door, armed with thy dagger.If I cry out, enter and kill the man.”"
"脑子里只剩艺术的普桑把她紧紧地抱在怀里。","Forgetting all but his art, Poussin clasped her in his arms."
"“他已经不爱我了！”吉勒特独自一人的时候会这样想。","“He loves me no longer!” thought Gillette, when she was once more alone."
"她后悔自己做出的承诺。但不久之后，她就陷入了比后悔更深的痛苦之中。一种担忧闯进了她心中，她拼命想把它赶走，却无能无力。当她开始怀疑他是否值得自己如此爱恋时，她觉得自己已经不那么爱他了。","She regretted her promise.But before long she fell a prey to an anguish far more cruel than her regret; and she struggled vainly to drive forth a terrible fear which forced its way into her mind.She felt that she loved him less as the suspicion rose in her heart that he was less worthy than she had thought him."
"第二章","CHAPTER II"
"和普桑初次见面三个月之后，波尔比斯去探望了弗朗霍斐大师。他发觉这位老人变得自暴自弃、极度消沉起来。究其原因，按医生的说法，在于消化不良、受寒、气候不适、肠内部分肿胀，或是别的因素；按照诡辩者的说法，是因为我们人类的德性本身就有缺陷。事实上这位好人只是在竭力完成他那神秘的作品时疲劳过度了。他疲惫无力地坐在一张罩着黑皮的大橡木椅上。他保持着忧郁的姿势，用冷漠的眼神看了波尔比斯一眼，就像一个无比颓丧的人一样。","Three months after the first meeting of Porbus and Poussin, the former went to see Maitre Frenhofer.He found the old man a prey to one of those deep, self-developed discouragements, whose cause, if we are to believe the mathematicians of health, lies in a bad digestion, in the wind, in the weather, in some swelling of the intestines, or else, according to casuists, in the imperfections of our moral nature; the fact being that the good man was simply worn out by the effort to complete his mysterious picture.He was seated languidly in a large oaken chair of vast dimensions covered with black leather; and without changing his melancholy attitude he cast on Porbus the distant glance of a man sunk in absolute dejection."
"“呃，大师，”波尔比斯说道，“是您专程前往布鲁塞尔买的青蓝色颜料没有用处吗？您不会研磨新的白颜料吗？是油画颜料不好，还是画笔不顺手？”","“Well, maitre,” said Porbus, “was the distant ultra-marine, for which you journeyed to Brussels, worthless?Are you unable to grind a new white?Is the oil bad, or the brushes restive?”"
"“唉！”老人大声说，“我有阵子以为作品已经完工了，但我一定是在某些细节上自欺欺人了。不解除这疑惑，我就平静不下来。我打算去旅行，去土耳其，去亚洲，去希腊寻找模特。我一定要把我的画与各种类型的实物对比一下。或许我在楼上画的，”他补充道，唇边带着满意的微笑，“就是实物本身。有时我有些担心，害怕我的画笔会唤醒这女人，然后她会从我眼前消失。”","“Alas!” cried the old man, “I thought for one moment that my work was accomplished; but I must have deceived myself in some of the details.I shall have no peace until I clear up my doubts.I am about to travel; I go to Turkey, Asia, Greece, in search of models.I must compare my picture with various types of Nature.It may be that I have up THERE,” he added, letting a smile of satisfaction flicker on his lip, “Nature herself.At times I am half afraid that a brush may wake this woman, and that she will disappear from sight.”"
"他突然站起来，好像马上就要动身一样。“等等。”波尔比斯惊叫道。“我来得还算及时，省得你既花钱又费力地去旅行。”","He rose suddenly, as if to depart at once.“Wait,” exclaimed Porbus.“I have come in time to spare you the costs and fatigues of such a journey.”"
"“怎么讲？”弗朗霍斐惊奇地问道。","“How so?” asked Frenhofer, surprised."
"“年轻的普桑有一个恋人，那女子无比美丽、完美无暇。但是，我亲爱的大师，假如他同意把这女子借你一用，至少你得让我们看看你的画。”","“Young Poussin is beloved by a woman whose incomparable beauty is without imperfection.But, my dear master, if he consents to lend her to you, at least you must let us see your picture.”"
"老人依旧站着，纹丝不动，处于近乎麻木的状态。“什么！”他终于悲伤地惊叫出来。“展示我的创作，我的妻子，我的快乐？——扯掉贞洁地护佑着她的面纱？那是作践自己！我和这个女人在一起生活了十年。她是我的，我一个人的！她爱我！我一笔一笔地绘制了她，她不是对我微笑了吗？她有灵魂——这灵魂是我赐予她的。如果是别人而不是我在注视着她，她会羞得满脸通红。让她抛头露面？——什么样的丈夫或情人会下贱到这种地步，连自己的妻子都借出去，让她蒙羞？在你为宫廷画一幅画的时候，你并不会全身心地投入其中。你卖给朝臣们的只是你修饰过的人体模型。而我的画作不是一幅画，而是一种感情，一种激情！她诞生于我的画室，就必须在那儿保持她的贞节。她不能赤身裸体地离开。就像真理一样，诗歌和女人只有在面对情人的时候，才能让自己赤裸身体。我们拥有拉斐尔的模特，阿里奥斯托的安杰莉卡，但丁的比阿特丽斯吗？没有！我们看到的仅仅是她们的外表。行了，我锁在屋里深藏起来的作品是不同于其他任何艺术作品的。那不是一幅油画，而是一个女人——一个与我一起哭泣、一起欢笑、一起思考、一起说话的女人。你是要我放弃这十年的欢乐，就像扔掉一件破旧的上衣一样吗？你要让我立刻停止做父亲，停止做情人，停止做造物者吗？——这个女人不是动物，她是我的创造。把你那位年轻人带来吧，我把我的珍藏给他——给他柯勒乔、米开朗琪罗、提香的画，我会亲吻地上他留下的足迹——但是，让他做我的情敌吗？羞死我了！嘿！与其说我是个画家，倒不如说我是个情人。在断气前，我会使出全身力气烧掉我的《裸女》。可是让她长时间被一个男人凝视，一个年轻男人，一个画家？——不，不行！谁敢亵渎她一眼，第二天我就会把他杀了！如果你不跪在她面前膜拜她的话——你，我的朋友——我会杀了你。你以为我会让我的偶像拿去忍受蠢人那冷漠的双眼和愚昧的批判吗？噢，爱是难以理解的！它的生命在灵魂的深处。当一个人，即便是对他的朋友说‘这就是我爱的女人’时，那生命就停止了。”","The old man remained standing, motionless, in a state bordering on stupefaction.“What!” he at last exclaimed, mournfully.“Show my creature, my spouse?—tear off the veil with which I have chastely hidden my joy?It would be prostitution!For ten years I have lived with this woman; she is mine, mine alone!she loves me!Has she not smiled upon me as, touch by touch, I painted her?She has a soul,—the soul with which I endowed her.She would blush if other eyes than mine beheld her.Let her be seen?—where is the husband, the lover, so debased as to lend his wife to dishonor?When you paint a picture for the court you do not put your whole soul into it; you sell to courtiers your tricked-out lay-figures.My painting is not a picture; it is a sentiment, a passion!Born in my atelier, she must remain a virgin there.She shall not leave it unclothed.Poesy and women give themselves bare, like truth, to lovers only.Have we the model of Raphael, the Angelica of Ariosto, the Beatrice of Dante?No, we see but their semblance.Well, the work which I keep hidden behind bolts and bars is an exception to all other art.It is not a canvas; it is a woman,—a woman with whom I weep and laugh and think and talk.Would you have me resign the joy of ten years, as I might throw away a worn-out doublet?Shall I, in a moment, cease to be father, lover, creator? —this woman is not a creature; she is my creation.Bring your young man; I will give him my treasures,—paintings of Correggio, Michaelangelo, Titian; I will kiss the print of his feet in the dust,—but make him my rival?Shame upon me!Ha!I am more a lover than I am a painter.I shall have the strength to burn my Nut-girl ere I render my last sigh; but suffer her to endure the glance of a man, a young man, a painter?—No, no!I would kill on the morrow the man who polluted her with a look!I would kill you,—you, my friend,—if you did not worship her on your knees; and think you I would submit my idol to the cold eyes and stupid criticisms of fools?Ah, love is a mystery!Its life is in the depths of the soul; it dies when a man says, even to his friend, Here is she whom I love.”"
"老人仿佛重新获得了青春活力，他的眼里充满了生命的光辉和热情，苍白的脸颊溢满了生动的红润色彩，双手颤抖不已。他说这些话时所带的激愤之情让波尔比斯无比惊讶，他不知道该如何回应这种既新奇又深切的情感。他产生这些念头是出于艺术家的奇思妙想还是源自一种狂热？人只要长期构思鸿篇巨著，就会时不时地陷入这种狂热。我们能与这个奇怪而反复无常的人讨价还价吗？","The old man seemed to renew his youth; his eyes had the brilliancy and fire of life, his pale cheeks blushed a vivid red, his hands trembled.Porbus, amazed by the passionate violence with which he uttered these words, knew not how to answer a feeling so novel and yet so profound.Was the old man under the thraldom of an artist’s fancy? or did these ideas flow from the unspeakable fanaticism produced at times in every mind by the long gestation of a noble work?Was it possible to bargain with this strange and whimsical being?"
"想着这些，波尔比斯对老人说：“这不就是用女人换女人吗？普桑要把他的情人借给你看。”","Filled with such thoughts, Porbus said to the old man, “Is it not woman for woman?Poussin lends his mistress to your eyes.”"
"“那算什么情人？”弗朗霍斐大声说，“她迟早会背叛他的。而我的情人会永远忠诚于我。”","“What sort of mistress is that?” cried Frenhofer.“She will betray him sooner or later.Mine will be to me forever faithful.”"
"“好吧。”波尔比斯回答说，“那我们就别说了。但是你恐怕到死也找不到像我所说的那样完美的女人。就算你一直找到亚洲也找不到。你的作品永远都是半成品。","“Well,” returned Porbus, “then let us say no more.But before you find, even in Asia, a woman as beautiful, as perfect, as the one I speak of, you may be dead, and your picture forever unfinished.”"
"“哦，它已经完成了！”弗朗霍斐说，“无论谁看见它，都能看见窗帘掩映着一张天鹅丝绒床，床上躺着一个女人，她身边的金色三脚香炉正在散发着香气。观看者会不禁想拉开系着窗帘的绳穗。他会以为看到了卡特琳•莱斯科——一位外号叫‘漂亮裸女’的模特。他会看见她的胸脯正随着呼吸上下起伏。可是——我想要弄清楚——”","“Oh, it is finished!” said Frenhofer.“Whoever sees it will find a woman lying on a velvet bed, beneath curtains; perfumes are exhaling from a golden tripod by her side: he will be tempted to take the tassels of the cord that holds back the curtain; he will think he sees the bosom of Catherine Lescaut,—a model called the Beautiful Nut-girl; he will see it rise and fall with the movement of her breathing.Yet—I wish I could be sure—”"
"“那么，去亚洲吧。”波尔比斯赶紧说，想象着他从老人眼里看到了几丝犹豫。","“Go to Asia, then,” said Porbus hastily, fancying he saw some hesitation in the old man’s eye."
"波尔比斯朝房门走了几步。这时，吉勒特和尼古拉斯•普桑刚来到老人宅子的大门口。年轻姑娘正要进屋时，突然松开了情人的胳膊，缩了回来，好像被不祥的预感摄住了。“我来这儿干什么？”她注视着普桑，低声问他。","Porbus made a few steps towards the door of the room.At this moment Gillette and Nicolas Poussin reached the entrance of the house.As the young girl was about to enter, she dropped the arm of her lover and shrank back as if overcome by a presentiment.“What am I doing here?” she said to Poussin, in a deep voice, looking at him fixedly."
"“吉勒特，我的情人，我让你自己做主，我愿意遵从你的意愿。你是我的良心和荣耀。回家吧，也许我会高兴的，如果你，你自己——”","“Gillette, I leave you mistress of your actions; I will obey your will.You are my conscience, my glory.Come home; I shall be happy, perhaps, if you, yourself—”"
"“当你这样对我说时，我还有什么主见？哎，不！我还是个小孩。来吧。”她继续说着，看起来是在竭力克制自己。“如果我们的爱情就此毁灭，如果我的心中长留遗憾，你的名望就是我顺从你意愿的最好回报。我们进去吧。我也可能仍然活着——作为回忆活在你的画板上。","“Have I a self when you speak thus to me?Oh, no!I am but a child.Come,” she continued, seeming to make a violent effort.“If our love perishes, if I put into my heart a long regret, thy fame shall be the guerdon of my obedience to thy will.Let us enter.I may yet live again,—a memory on thy palette.”"
"打开屋门，这对情人恰好碰见波尔比斯从里面出来。吉勒特的眼中含着泪水，浑身发抖。波尔比斯惊讶于年轻姑娘的美貌，拉住她的手，把她带到年迈的大师身边。","Opening the door of the house the two lovers met Porbus coming out.Astonished at the beauty of the young girl, whose eyes were still wet with tears, he caught her all trembling by the hand and led her to the old master."
"“好啦！”他喊道，“她的价值难道比不上这世间所有的杰作吗？”　","“There!” he cried; “is she not worth all the masterpieces in the world?”"
"弗朗霍斐怔了一下。吉勒特站在他面前，一派天真无邪的样子，宛如一个被强盗抓来献给奴隶贩子的格鲁吉亚女孩，年轻、胆小而羞怯。一抹羞怯的绯红布满她的面颊。她眼帘低垂，双手垂在身体两侧，看起来浑身无力，眼泪像是在抗议着侵犯她纯洁的暴力。普桑咒骂着自己，后悔自己的愚蠢，竟然把这件宝贝从宁静的阁楼带到了这里。他再次成为情人而不是艺术家。当他看见老画家重新焕发青春活力的目光时，良心使他的心抽搐不安。出于画家的习惯，老画家的目光已经脱去了少女的衣衫，看见了她美丽的形体。真爱使他变得极度嫉妒起来。","Frenhofer quivered.Gillette stood before him in the ingenuous, simple attitude of a young Georgian, innocent and timid, captured by brigands and offered to a slave-merchant.A modest blush suffused her cheeks, her eyes were lowered, her hands hung at her sides, strength seemed to abandon her, and her tears protested against the violence done to her purity.Poussin cursed himself, and repented of his folly in bringing this treasure from their peaceful garret.Once more he became a lover rather than an artist; scruples convulsed his heart as he saw the eye of the old painter regain its youth and, with the artist’s habit, disrobe as it were the beauteous form of the young girl.He was seized with the jealous frenzy of a true lover."
"“吉勒特！”他喊道，“我们走。”","“Gillette!” he cried; “let us go.”"
"听见这充满爱意的呼喊声，他的情人高兴地抬眼看着他，接着奔向他的怀抱。","At this cry, with its accent of love, his mistress raised her eyes joyfully and looked at him; then she ran into his arms."
"“啊！你还是爱我的？”她轻声说着，突然大哭起来。","“Ah! you love me still?” she whispered, bursting into tears."
"虽然她刚才有力掩饰心中的痛苦，但她现在却无力隐藏心中的欢乐。","Though she had had strength to hide her suffering, she had none to hide her joy."
"“让我占用她一会儿吧。”画家大声说，“你们可以把她和我的卡特琳比比。好的，好的，我同意了！”","“Let me have her for one moment,” exclaimed the old master, “and you shall compare her with my Catherine.Yes, yes; I consent!”"
"就像普桑的叫喊一样，弗朗霍斐的喊声里充满了爱，还掺杂了他假装女里女气时表现出的妒人的媚态。他像是在为他那贞洁的女子必将在比美中胜过活生生的女人而欢庆。","There was love in the cry of Frenhofer as in that of Poussin, mingled with jealous coquetry on behalf of his semblance of a woman; he seemed to revel in the triumph which the beauty of his virgin was about to win over the beauty of the living woman."
"“别让他反悔。”波尔比斯拍着普桑的肩膀大声说，“爱情的果实一天就会枯萎，艺术的果实却会永久存留。”","“Do not let him retract,” cried Porbus, striking Poussin on the shoulder.“The fruits of love wither in a day; those of art are immortal.”"
"“会不会，”吉勒特双目坚定地盯着普桑和波尔比斯，“对他而言，我不过只是个女人？”","“Can it be,” said Gillette, looking steadily at Poussin and at Porbus, “that I am nothing more than a woman to him?”"
"她骄傲地抬起头，忽闪忽闪的眼睛朝弗朗霍斐看了一眼，却发现她的情人又在端详那幅他以前误认为乔尔乔涅作品的画。","She raised her head proudly; and as she glanced at Frenhofer with flashing eyes she saw her lover gazing once more at the picture he had formerly taken for a Giorgione."
"“啊！”她喊道，“让我们进去吧，他从来没有那样看过我！”","“Ah!” she cried, “let us go in; he never looked at me like that!”"
"“老头子！”普桑的沉思被吉勒特的声音惊醒，说道，“看这柄剑。只要听到那位姑娘的喊叫，我就会把这把剑插进你的心脏。我会放火烧你的房子，不让一个人逃出去。你听懂了吗？”","“Old man!” said Poussin, roused from his meditation by Gillette’s voice, “see this sword.I will plunge it into your heart at the first cry of that young girl.I will set fire to your house, and no one shall escape from it.Do you understand me?”"
"他神情阴郁，说话的语气也很可怕。他的态度，最重要的是他手握武器的姿势，使那可怜的姑娘感到了安慰，她差不多已经原谅他了，原谅他这样为艺术，为锦绣前程的希望而牺牲她。","His look was gloomy and the tones of his voice were terrible.His attitude, and above all the gesture with which he laid his hand upon the weapon, comforted the poor girl, who half forgave him for thus sacrificing her to his art and to his hopes of a glorious future."
"波尔比斯和普桑留在紧闭的画室门外，互相看着，一言不发。《埃及的玛利亚》的画者先发出了几声惊呼：“啊！她脱衣服了！”——“他叫她站在光亮处！”——“他在把她俩作比较了！”但他一看到年轻人的哀容，就沉默了下来。虽然老的画家们面对艺术时不会有这种狭隘的顾虑，但他们精神饱满、心情尚佳时会尊重其他有这种顾虑的人。年轻人手握利剑，耳朵似乎牢牢地贴在了门板上。两个人站在阴暗处，朦胧中看起来像是正在等待时机来袭击暴君的谋反者。","Porbus and Poussin remained outside the closed door of the atelier, looking at one another in silence.At first the painter of the Egyptian Mary uttered a few exclamations: “Ah, she unclothes herself!” —“He tells her to stand in the light!”—“He compares them!” but he grew silent as he watched the mournful face of the young man; for though old painters have none of such petty scruples in presence of their art, yet they admire them in others, when they are fresh and pleasing.The young man held his hand on his sword, and his ear seemed glued to the panel of the door.Both men, standing darkly in the shadow, looked like conspirators waiting the hour to strike a tyrant."
"“进来！进来吧！”老人笑容满面、喜气洋洋地说道。“我的作品是完美的，我现在可以骄傲地展示它了。永远不会有任何画家，任何画笔，任何色彩，任何画布，任何光线能与卡特琳•莱斯科这位《漂亮的裸女》相匹敌。”","“Come in! come in!” cried the old man, beaming with happiness.“My work is perfect; I can show it now with pride.Never shall painter, brushes, colors, canvas, light, produce the rival of Catherine Lescaut, the Beautiful Nut-girl.”"
"波尔比斯和普桑在强烈的好奇心支配下冲进充满灰尘的大画室中。屋中杂乱地放着各种东西，墙上四处挂着油画。他们满怀热切的赞美之情，在一幅真人般大小的半裸女人像前停了下来。","Porbus and Poussin, seized with wild curiosity, rushed into the middle of a vast atelier filled with dust, where everything lay in disorder, and where they saw a few paintings hanging here and there upon the walls.They stopped before the figure of a woman, life-sized and half nude, which filled them with eager admiration."
"“不要看那幅。”弗朗霍斐说，“那只是我在研究一种姿势时乱画的，不值钱。”“那些都是我画废的作品。”他朝四周墙上那些迷人的画作摇摇手补充说。","“Do not look at that,” said Frenhofer, “it is only a daub which I made to study a pose; it is worth nothing.”“Those are my errors,” he added, waving his hand towards the enchanting compositions on the walls around them."
"听了这些话，波尔比斯和普桑很吃惊大师会如此轻视这样的艺术佳作，便四下寻找那幅神秘的宝贝，却怎么也找不到。","At these words Porbus and Poussin, amazed at the disdain which the master showed for such marvels of art, looked about them for the secret treasure, but could see it nowhere."
"“就在那儿！”老人说。他异常激动，脸涨得猩红，头发杂乱地垂在脸上。他的眼睛闪着光亮，胸部像为爱而疯狂的年轻人那样起伏着。","“There it is!” said the old man, whose hair fell in disorder about his face, which was scarlet with supernatural excitement.His eyes sparkled, and his breast heaved like that of a young man beside himself with love."
"“啊哈！”他大声喊道，“你从没想到会这么完美吧！你们站在一个女人面前，却在寻找一幅画！画的景深是如此出色，画中的空气是那么逼真，让你们无法将它和你们呼吸的空气区分开来。艺术哪里去了？死去了，消失了！这里的形体本身就是一个少女。我不正抓住了色彩，不正抓住了这个看似界定身体轮廓的线条的生命吗？我们在水里的游鱼周围观察到的现象对于在空气中飘浮的物体同样适用。看看这些轮廓是怎样从背景中凸显出来的。你们是不是感觉手可以越过这些肩膀，伸到它们后面？七年来，我一直在研究光线和形体相结合所能产生的这些效果。那头发——不正是沐浴在阳光里吗？看哪，她会呼吸！那胸脯——看啊！啊！谁不会屈膝拜倒在她面前？那颤动着的胴体！等一下，她就要站起来了，等一下！”","“Ah!” he cried, “did you not expect such perfection?You stand before a woman, and you are looking for a picture!There are such depths on that canvas, the air within it is so true, that you are unable to distinguish it from the air you breathe.Where is art?Departed, vanished!Here is the form itself of a young girl.Have I not caught the color, the very life of the line which seems to terminate the body?The same phenomenon which we notice around fishes in the water is also about objects which float in air.See how these outlines spring forth from the background.Do you not feel that you could pass your hand behind those shoulders?For seven years have I studied these effects of light coupled with form.That hair,—is it not bathed in light?Why, she breathes!That bosom,—see!Ah! who would not worship it on bended knee?The flesh palpitates!Wait, she is about to rise; wait!”"
"“你看见什么了吗？”普桑低声问波尔比斯。","“Can you see anything?” whispered Poussin to Porbus."
"“什么也没有。你看见了吗？”","“Nothing.Can you?”"
"“没有。”","“No.”"
"两位画家，留下沉醉在狂喜中的老人，退到一边，想看看是不是正射在老人指着的那张画布上的阳光让一切效果都失效了。他们从画的右侧向左走去，停在画的正前方，一会儿弯着腰，一会儿侧着头，一会儿又站起身来，想尽办法来仔细地看这幅画。","The two painters drew back, leaving the old man absorbed in ecstasy, and tried to see if the light, falling plumb upon the canvas at which he pointed, had neutralized all effects.They examined the picture, moving from right to left, standing directly before it, bending, swaying, rising by turns."
"“好了，好了，这真是一张画布。”弗朗霍斐误会了他们仔细看画的用意，如此说道。“看，这是画框，这是画架，这些是颜料，还有我的画笔。”他迅速地抓起一支画笔，天真地递给他们看。","“Yes, yes; it is really a canvas,” cried Frenhofer, mistaking the purpose of their examination.“See, here is the frame, the easel; these are my colors, my brushes.”And he caught up a brush which he held out to them with a naive motion."
"“这个老流氓在捉弄我们。”普桑边说边走近那假想的画像。“我在这里只看见一大片混乱的色彩，其间交错着许多古怪的线条，像是一堵上了色的墙。”　","“The old rogue is making game of us,” said Poussin, coming close to the pretended picture.“I can see nothing here but a mass of confused color, crossed by a multitude of eccentric lines, making a sort of painted wall.”"
"“我们错了。看！”波尔比斯回答道。","“We are mistaken.See!” returned Porbus."
"他们又走近了点，在画布的角落里看到一只光脚。这只脚极其迷人、极其逼真，从各种颜色、各种色调、各种阴影中凸显出来。这些阴影朦胧如烟雾，模糊而无形。这块美丽的部位打破了四周无尽的毁灭，让站在前面的他们叹为观止。这种毁灭缓缓发展，日渐严重。在他们看来，看到这只脚就像是在烧毁的城市废墟中发现了古希腊维纳斯的裸身雕像一样。","Coming nearer, they perceived in a corner of the canvas the point of a naked foot, which came forth from the chaos of colors, tones, shadows hazy and undefined, misty and without form,—an enchanting foot, a living foot.They stood lost in admiration before this glorious fragment breaking forth from the incredible, slow, progressive destruction around it.The foot seemed to them like the torso of some Grecian Venus, brought to light amid the ruins of a burned city."
"“整张画下面藏着一个女人。”波尔比斯喊道，并提醒普桑注意那层层的色彩。那是老画家相继加上的，他相信这样能使他的作品趋于完美。两个人一同朝弗朗霍斐转过身来，开始模糊地理解了他欣喜若狂的精神状态。","“There is a woman beneath it all!” cried Porbus, calling Poussin’s attention to the layers of color which the old painter had successively laid on, believing that he thus brought his work to perfection.The two men turned towards him with one accord, beginning to comprehend, though vaguely, the ecstasy in which he lived."
"“他说的话是真心的。”波尔比斯说。","“He means it in good faith,” said Porbus."
"“是的，我的朋友。”老人从出神的状态中醒来说，“我们需要真心，真心对艺术。创作出这样的作品前，我们必须同我们的作品一起生活很多年。画面上的一些阴影花费了我无数的辛劳。瞧她面颊上眼睛下面有模糊的半影。如果你们在真人身上见过这种半影，你恐怕会认为这几乎没法用画表现出来。好啦，相信我！为了再现那种效果，我付出了闻所未闻的辛劳。我亲爱的波尔比斯，注意看我的作品，你会理解我告诉过你的处理形体和轮廓的方法。看看胸部的光线，看我是怎样将一系列高光和更亮的光线重重地打在这里来把握光线本身，并把光线和色调更清晰的耀眼白色结合起来；然后，看我怎样通过相反的方法——钝化油彩的高对比度和纹理——再通过润色画像的轮廓并罩以阴沉的灰调子，我才能摆脱素描这个概念本身的束缚和所有人为的东西的羁绊，才能让人物和真人本身有一样的外观，和真人一样饱满。再走近点，作品看起来就更清晰，太远就看不见了。看！那儿，我认为那个点画得最出色。”他用画笔的末端指着一小块明亮的浅色彩。","“Yes, my friend,” answered the old man, rousing from his abstraction, “we need faith; faith in art.We must live with our work for years before we can produce a creation like that.Some of these shadows have cost me endless toil.See, there on her cheek, below the eyes, a faint half-shadow; if you observed it in Nature you might think it could hardly be rendered.Well, believe me, I took unheard-of pains to reproduce that effect.My dear Porbus, look attentively at my work, and you will comprehend what I have told you about the manner of treating form and outline.Look at the light on the bosom, and see how by a series of touches and higher lights firmly laid on I have managed to grasp light itself, and combine it with the dazzling whiteness of the clearer tones; and then see how, by an opposite method,—smoothing off the sharp contrasts and the texture of the color,—I have been able, by caressing the outline of my figure and veiling it with cloudy half-tints, to do away with the very idea of drawing and all other artificial means, and give to the form the aspect and roundness of Nature itself.Come nearer, and you will see the work more distinctly; if too far off it disappears.See! there, at that point, it is, I think, most remarkable.”And with the end of his brush he pointed to a spot of clear light color."
"波尔比斯拍拍老人的肩膀，转向普桑说：“你知道他是最杰出的画家之一吗？”","Porbus struck the old man on the shoulder, turning to Poussin as he did so, and said, “Do you know that he is one of our greatest painters?”"
"“他不只是一位画家，更是一位诗人。”普桑认真地说。","“He is a poet even more than he is a painter,” answered Poussin gravely."
"“那，”波尔比斯摸着那幅画接着说，“是我们人间艺术的极限。”　","“There,” returned Porbus, touching the canvas, “is the ultimate end of our art on earth.”"
"“从那里，”普桑又说，“艺术得到了升华，超越了凡间。”","“And from thence,” added Poussin, “it rises, to enter heaven.”"
"“那块画布上有多少乐趣啊！”波尔比斯说。","“How much happiness is there!—upon that canvas,” said Porbus."
"全神贯注的老人毫不留意他们的谈话，他正对着那个幻想出的女人微笑。","The absorbed old man gave no heed to their words; he was smiling at his visionary woman."
"“但迟早他会察觉画上什么也没有。”普桑大声说。","“But sooner or later, he will perceive that there is nothing there,” cried Poussin."
"“什么也没有！——我的画上？”弗朗霍斐说道。他看看两位画家，又看看自己想象中的画。","“Nothing there!—upon my canvas?” said Frenhofer, looking first at the two painters, and then at his imaginary picture."
"“你刚刚说了什么？”弗朗霍斐转向普桑大喊道。","“What have you done?” cried Porbus, addressing Poussin."
"老人猛地抓住年轻人的手臂，对他喊道：“你什么也没看见？——你这个小丑！怪胎！恶棍！蠢货！你为什么到这儿来？我的好波尔比斯，”他转向他的朋友，又说，“你也会取笑我吗？回答我，我是你的朋友。告诉我，难道我把自己的画搞砸了吗？”　","The old man seized the arm of the young man violently, and said to him, “You see nothing?—clown, infidel, scoundrel, dolt!Why did you come here?My good Porbus,” he added, turning to his friend, “is it possible that you, too, are jesting with me?Answer; I am your friend.Tell me, can it be that I have spoiled my picture?”"
"波尔比斯犹豫了，他不敢说。然而，他无法忍受老人苍白的脸上露出的焦虑之情，他不得不指着画说：“看！”","Porbus hesitated, and feared to speak; but the anxiety painted on the white face of the old man was so cruel that he was constrained to point to the canvas and utter the word, “See!”"
"弗朗霍斐注视着自己的画看了半天，感到惊讶不已。","Frenhofer looked at his picture for a space of a moment, and staggered."
"“什么也没有！什么也没有！我辛苦了十年！”他坐在那里哭了起来。","“Nothing! nothing! after toiling ten years!”He sat down and wept."
"“那么，我是个傻瓜，是个白痴吗？我既没有天分也没有能力吗？我和那些行尸走肉般的有钱人一样差劲吗？我确实什么也没有创作出来吗？”　","“Am I then a fool, an idiot?Have I neither talent nor capacity?Am I no better than a rich man who walks, and can only walk?Have I indeed produced nothing?”"
"透过泪水，他凝视着自己的油画。突然，他骄傲地直起身子，闪电般地瞥了两位画家一眼。","He gazed at the canvas through tears.Suddenly he raised himself proudly and flung a lightning glance upon the two painters."
"“我以基督的宝血，基督的贵体，基督的圣首作证，你们满怀嫉妒，企图让我认为她被毁坏了，好从我这儿把她偷走。我——我看见她了！”他大喊道，“她极其的美！”　","“By the blood, by the body, by the head of Christ, you are envious men who seek to make me think she is spoiled, that you may steal her from me.I—I see her!” he cried.“She is wondrously beautiful!”"
"此时，普桑听到吉勒特的哭泣声，她站在角落里，被人遗忘了。","At this moment Poussin heard the weeping of Gillette as she stood, forgotten, in a corner."
"“亲爱的，你怎么啦？”年轻的画家问道，他又变成了情人。","“What troubles thee, my darling?” asked the painter, becoming once more a lover."
"“杀了我吧！”她回答道，“假如我还爱你，我就太丢脸了，因为我鄙视你。我钦佩你，但你使我满怀憎恶。我爱你，可是，我已经开始恨你了。”　","“Kill me!” she answered.“I should be infamous if I still loved thee, for I despise thee.I admire thee; but thou hast filled me with horror.I love, and yet already I hate thee.”"
"当普桑在听吉勒特说话的时候，弗朗霍斐拉过绿窗帘遮在他的卡特琳前面。他脸上带着严肃、沉着的表情，像一个以为盗贼就在附近而锁上抽屉的珠宝商一般。他看了两位画家一眼，像在极力掩饰什么，目光充满轻视和猜疑。然后，他一言不发，急促地把他们推出了画室大门。当他们走到房子大门口时，弗朗霍斐对他们说道：“再见，我年轻的朋友们。”","While Poussin listened to Gillette, Frenhofer drew a green curtain before his Catherine, with the grave composure of a jeweller locking his drawers when he thinks that thieves are near him.He cast at the two painters a look which was profoundly dissimulating, full of contempt and suspicion; then, with convulsive haste, he silently pushed them through the door of his atelier.When they reached the threshold of his house he said to them, “Adieu, my little friends.”"
"他告别时的语气把两位画家吓得冰冷。","The tone of this farewell chilled the two painters with fear."
"第二天，波尔比斯有些担忧，就再次来探望弗朗霍斐，却发现他已经在夜里烧掉了所有的画作，与世长辞了。","On the morrow Porbus, alarmed, went again to visit Frenhofer, and found that he had died during the night, after having burned his paintings."
