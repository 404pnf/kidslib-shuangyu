"失语漫游","A Ramble in Aphasia"
"作者：欧·亨利","by O. Henry"
"那天早晨，我和妻子正如往常一样告别。她放下她的第二杯茶，跟随我走到前门。在门口，她从我西服的翻领里扯出一根看不到的线头（这是女人们宣告所有权的普遍行为），并嘱咐我注意感冒。我没有感冒。接着是她的告别吻——那带有雨茶芳香的、充满家庭生活气息的吻。不必担心，她无限延续的习惯里不会有率性而为的、五花八门的新举动。由于长久以来习惯性的失职，她把我那原本端正的领带夹碰歪了。接着，在关门的时候，我听到她大清早拖着拖鞋走回她渐渐变凉的茶边的步履声。","My wife and I parted on that morning in precisely our usual manner.She left her second cup of tea to follow me to the front door.There she plucked from my lapel the invisible strand of lint (the universal act of woman to proclaim ownership) and bade me to take care of my cold.I had no cold.Next came her kiss of parting—the level kiss of domesticity flavored with Young Hyson.There was no fear of the extemporaneous, of variety spicing her infinite custom.With the deft touch of long malpractice, she dabbed awry my well-set scarf pin; and then, as I closed the door, I heard her morning slippers pattering back to her cooling tea."
"出发时，我并没有想过或是预测到接下来将要发生的事。这病来得突然。","When I set out I had no thought or premonition of what was to occur.The attack came suddenly."
"数周以来，我一直在辛苦工作——几乎夜以继日；我在忙一桩轰动一时的铁路诉讼案，结果我大获全胜，这也不过是几天前的事而已。事实上，多年以来，我一直在苦心钻研法律，几乎从没中止过。优秀的沃尔尼医生已经警告过我一两次了。他是我的朋友，也是我的医师。","For many weeks I had been toiling, almost night and day, at a famous railroad law case that I won triumphantly but a few days previously.In fact, I had been digging away at the law almost without cessation for many years.Once or twice good Doctor Volney, my friend and physician, had warned me."
"“如果你不放松下来的话，贝尔福德，”他说道，“你会突然身心崩溃的。要么你的神经会出问题，要么你的大脑会吃不消。告诉我，哪个星期你在报纸上没读到有关失语症的病例？——某个走失的男子，他的过去和身份都无从查起，没名没姓地漂泊——而这一切都是由大脑里的一个小血块引起的，其根源在于工作过度或忧虑。”","“If you don’t slacken up, Bellford,” he said, “you’ll go suddenly to pieces.Either your nerves or your brain will give way.Tell me, does a week pass in which you do not read in the papers of a case of aphasia—of some man lost, wandering nameless, with his past and his identity blotted out—and all from that little brain clot made by overwork or worry?”"
"“我总以为，”我说，“那些病例中说的血块其实是在那些报社记者的大脑里找到的。”","“I always thought,” said I, “that the clot in those instances was really to be found on the brains of the newspaper reporters.”"
"沃尔尼医生摇摇头。","Doctor Volney shook his head."
"“这种病确实存在，”他说道，“你需要改变或者休息。法庭、办公室和家——这就是你唯一的出行路线。至于娱乐——对你而言就是读法律书籍。你最好及时听取我的警告。”","“The disease exists,” he said.“You need a change or a rest.Court-room, office and home—there is the only route you travel.For recreation you—read law books.Better take warning in time.”"
"“每周四晚上，”我辩驳道，“我和我妻子玩克里比奇牌戏。每周日，她给我读她母亲的每周来信。法律书籍不是一种消遣，这一说法还有待确证。”","“On Thursday nights,” I said, defensively, “my wife and I play cribbage.On Sundays she reads to me the weekly letter from her mother.That law books are not a recreation remains yet to be established.”"
"那天早晨，我一边走着，一边想起了沃尔尼医生的话。我感觉跟往常一样好——也许比平常更加精神焕发。","That morning as I walked I was thinking of Doctor Volney’s words.I was feeling as well as I usually did—possibly in better spirits than usual."
"由于在客车那狭窄的座位上睡了很长一段时间，醒来时我浑身僵硬、肌肉抽筋。我把头倚靠在座位上努力地去想。过了很长一段时间后，我对自己说道：“我肯定有个什么名字。”我翻看我的口袋。我没能找到一张卡片、一封信、一张纸或一个姓名首字母组成的花押字。但我却在我外套的口袋里找到了总额近3000美元的大面额钞票。“当然，我肯定是个什么人。”我对自己重复道，然后又一次陷入沉思中。","I woke with stiff and cramped muscles from having slept long on the incommodious seat of a day coach.I leaned my head against the seat and tried to think.After a long time I said to myself: “I must have a name of some sort.”I searched my pockets.Not a card; not a letter; not a paper or monogram could I find.But I found in my coat pocket nearly $3,000 in bills of large denomination.“I must be some one, of course,” I repeated to myself, and began again to consider."
"这趟车挤满了人。我暗自思忖，他们中间一定有着某些共同的爱好，因为他们无拘无束地混在一起，而且似乎心情和精神都极佳。他们中的一员——一个戴着眼镜的精壮的先生，浑身散发出明显的肉桂皮和芦荟的气味——向我友好地点了点头，同时占用了我的半个空位，随即打开了一张报纸。在他读报的间歇里，我们交谈着，像所有旅客那样谈谈当前的时事。我发现自己能够很好地将有关这方面话题的谈话维持下去，至少我的记忆在这样的谈话中还算够用。不久我的同伴说：“你肯定是我们中的一员。这次西部派出了非常多人。我很高兴他们在纽约召开大会；我以前从没去过东部。我名叫R. P. 波尔德——来自密苏里州希科里格罗夫的波尔德父子公司。”","The car was well crowded with men, among whom, I told myself, there must have been some common interest, for they intermingled freely, and seemed in the best good humor and spirits.One of them—a stout, spectacled gentleman enveloped in a decided odor of cinnamon and aloes—took the vacant half of my seat with a friendly nod, and unfolded a newspaper.In the intervals between his periods of reading, we conversed, as travelers will, on current affairs.I found myself able to sustain the conversation on such subjects with credit, at least to my memory.By and by my companion said: “You are one of us, of course.”Fine lot of men the West sends in this time.I’m glad they held the convention in New York; I’ve never been East before.My name’s R. P. Bolder—Bolder & Son, of Hickory Grove, Missouri.”"
"尽管毫无准备，我依然能应付这个紧急情况，就像当人们面对这样的情况时也能如此一样。现在我必须为自己举行一场洗礼，而且同时扮演婴儿、牧师和父母的角色。我的理智前来营救我那慢人一步的大脑。我同伴身上那挥之不去的药味给我提供了一个主意；我瞥了他的报纸一眼，看到了一个显眼的广告，这进一步帮了我。","Though unprepared, I rose to the emergency, as men will when put to it.Now must I hold a christening, and be at once babe, parson and parent.My senses came to the rescue of my slower brain.The insistent odor of drugs from my companion supplied one idea; a glance at his newspaper, where my eye met a conspicuous advertisement, assisted me further."
"“我叫爱德华·平卡汉默。”我流利地说，“我是一名药剂师，家住堪萨斯州的科诺普利斯。”","“My name,” said I, glibly, “is Edward Pinkhammer.I am a druggist, and my home is in Cornopolis, Kansas.”"
"“我知道你是一位药剂师，”我的旅伴友好地说，“我看见你右手食指因握碾槌而磨出老茧的地方了。你肯定是我们全国代表大会的一个代表。”","“I knew you were a druggist,” said my fellow traveler, affably.“I saw the callous spot on your right forefinger where the handle of the pestle rubs.Of course, you are a delegate to our National Convention.”"
"“这些人都是药剂师吗？”我惊讶地问道。","“Are all these men druggists?” I asked, wonderingly."
"“是的，他们都是药剂师。这车从西部开来。他们跟你一样,也是老一代的药剂师——而不是那些用自动贩卖机取代处方桌、专卖药片药粒的成药店伙计。我们自己过滤止痛剂，自己捻药丸，也不会经营糖果和鞋子副业、在春天里卖些花木种子。我告诉你，平卡汉默，在这次大会上，我有一个想法要提出来——他们需要的正是新点子。这么说吧，你知道药架上一瓶瓶的酒石酸氧锑钾和四水合酒石酸钾钠Ant. Et Pot. Tart.和Sod. Et Pot. Tart.——你知道，一个有毒，一个无害。看标签很容易把它们弄混淆。药剂师们通常把它们放在哪儿呢？唉，让它们离得尽可能远，放在不同的药架上。这是错误的。我说，得把它们并排着放，这样的话，当你想要一个时，你总能把它与另一个进行比较，如此一来就可以避免弄错了。你听懂这个主意了吗？”","“They are.This car came through from the West.And they’re your old-time druggists, too—none of your patent tablet-and-granule pharmashootists that use slot machines instead of a prescription desk.We percolate our own paregoric and roll our own pills, and we ain’t above handling a few garden seeds in the spring, and carrying a side line of confectionery and shoes.I tell you Hampinker, I’ve got an idea to spring on this convention—new ideas is what they want.Now, you know the shelf bottles of tartar emetic and Rochelle salt Ant. Et Pot. Tart. And Sod. Et Pot. Tart.—one’s poison, you know, and the other’s harmless.It’s easy to mistake one label for the other.Where do druggists mostly keep ’em?Why, as far apart as possible, on different shelves.That’s wrong.I say keep ’em side by side, so when you want one you can always compare it with the other and avoid mistakes.Do you catch the idea?”"
"“在我看来，这主意很好。”我回答。","“It seems to me a very good one,” I said."
"“好啊！我在大会上提出这个主意的时候，你要支持啊。那些整天摆弄橙色磷酸盐和按摩膏的东部教授们自以为他们是市场上唯一的锭剂，我们要让他们看起来就像皮下注射剂。”","“All right!When I spring it on the convention you back it up.We’ll make some of these Eastern orange-phosphate-and-massage-cream professors that think they’re the only lozenges in the market look like hypodermic tablets.”"
"“如果我能提供任何帮助的话，”我热切地说，“那两瓶——呃——”","“If I can be of any aid,” I said, warming, “the two bottles of—er—” "
"“酒石酸氧锑钾和四水合酒石酸钾钠。”","“Tartrate of antimony and potash, and tartrate of soda and potash.”"
"“从此以后应该并排放着。”我语气坚定地总结道。","“Shall henceforth sit side by side,” I concluded, firmly."
"“现在，还有另一件事，”波尔德先生说，“制作药丸时，你更喜欢用哪一种赋形剂——碳酸镁还是甘草根粉？”","“Now, there’s another thing,” said Mr. Bolder.“For an excipient in manipulating a pill mass which do you prefer—the magnesia carbonate or the pulverised glycerrhiza radix?”"
"“这个——呃——镁吧。”我说。这个词比另一个词更好说些。","“The—er—magnesia,” I said.It was easier to say than the other word."
"波尔德先生透过眼镜，猜疑地看了我一眼。","Mr. Bolder glanced at me distrustfully through his spectacles."
"“我用甘草，”他说，“镁会结块。”","“Give me the glycerrhiza,” said he.“Magnesia cakes.”"
"“这儿又有一个捏造出来的失语症病例，”不一会儿后，他把他的报纸递给我，用手指指着一篇报道说，“我不相信这些。我认为这其中十有八九都是骗人的把戏。一个人厌烦了他的工作和亲人，想去寻个开心罢了。他偷偷溜走，去到某个地方。当他们找到他时，他就假装失忆了——不知道他自己的名字，甚至认不出他妻子左肩上的红色胎记。失语症！啧！为什么他们不能呆在家失忆呢？”","“Here’s another one of these fake aphasia cases,” he said, presently, handing me his newspaper, and laying his finger upon an article.“I don’t believe in ’em.I put nine out of ten of ’em down as frauds.A man gets sick of his business and his folks and wants to have a good time.He skips out somewhere, and when they find him he pretends to have lost his memory—don’t know his own name, and won’t even recognize the strawberry mark on his wife’s left shoulder.Aphasia!Tut!Why can’t they stay at home and forget?”"
"我拿过报纸，读了起来。在醒目的标题后，正文如下：“丹佛，6月12日讯。——著名律师埃尔温·C. 贝尔福德三天前从家中神秘失踪，所有查明他下落的努力都付诸东流。贝尔福德先生是拥有极高社会地位的、名声显赫的公民。他的法律业务规模庞大、利润可观。他已婚，有一座精美的住所，还拥有本州最大的私人藏书室。在他失踪的那一天，他从银行里取出了一大笔钱。他离开银行后，再也没有人见过他。贝尔福德先生是一个非常好静并且恋家的人，而且似乎在家里和工作中得到了幸福。几个月来，他一直一心扑在一桩与Q. Y. & Z.铁路公司有关的重要的诉讼案上。如果关于他的离奇失踪有任何线索可循的话，那也许能在这件事情上找到点线索。恐怕过度工作已经影响了他的大脑。目前正在尽一切努力寻找这名失踪男子的下落。”","I took the paper and read, after the pungent headlines, the following: “ Denver, June 12.—Elwyn C. Bellford, a prominent lawyer, is myseteriously missing from his home since three days ago, and all efforts to locate him have been in vain.Mr. Bellford is a well-known citizen of the highest standing, and has enjoyed a large and lucrative law practice.He is married and owns a fine home and the most extensive private library in the State.On the day of his disappearance, he drew quite a large sum of money from his bank.No one can be found who saw him after he left the bank.Mr. Bellford was a man of singularly quiet and domestic tastes, and seemed to find his happiness in his home and profession.If any clue at all exists to his strange disappearance, it may be found in the fact that for some months he has been deeply absorbed in an important law case in connection with the Q. Y. and Z. Railroad Company.It is feared that overwork may have affected his mind.Every effort is being made to discover the whereabouts of the missing man.”"
"“波尔德先生，在我看来你有点愤世嫉俗啊，”读完这条新闻后我说，“依我看，这个病例似乎是真的。为什么这个事业有成、婚姻美满并且受人尊敬的人要突然选择放弃一切呢？我相信，这些记忆力衰退的情况确实发生了，并且，确实有人没名没姓、没有背景、没有家庭地漂泊着。”","“It seems to me you are not altogether uncynical, Mr. Bolder,” I said, after I had read the despatch.“This has the sound, to me, of a genuine case.Why should this man, prosperous, happily married, and respected, choose suddenly to abandon everything?I know that these lapses of memory do occur, and that men do find themselves adrift without a name, a history or a home.”"
"“唔，胡说八道！”波尔德先生说，“他们是在寻欢作乐。现在人们知道得太多了。男人们知道了失语症的事，就把它当作借口。女人们也聪明。当一切结束时，她们看着你的眼睛，很懂科学地说：‘他对我施了催眠术。’”","“Oh, gammon and jalap!” said Mr. Bolder.“It’s larks they’re after.There’s too much education nowadays.Men know about aphasia, and they use it for an excuse.The women are wise, too.When it’s all over they look you in the eye, as scientific as you please, and say: ‘He hypnotized me.’”"
"波尔德先生就这么转移了话题，不再用他的评论和观点来帮助我。","Thus Mr. Bolder diverted, but did not aid, me with his comments and philosophy."
"晚上10点左右，我们抵达纽约。我搭乘出租马车去了一家旅馆，在登记簿上写下我的名字“爱德华·平卡汉默”。就在我写下这个名字时，我感到全身充斥着一种绝妙的、狂热的、令人陶醉的轻松愉快——一种不受约束的自由感，一种充满新希望之感。我刚刚才出生来到这人世。往日束缚我的枷锁——无论它们曾是什么——都已从我的手脚上给砸掉了。仿佛婴儿刚来到这世上一样，未来在我面前展现了一条阳关大道；并且，我还能够以一个成年男子的学识和阅历来开始这段旅程。","We arrived in New York about ten at night.I rode in a cab to a hotel, and I wrote my name “Edward Pinkhammer” in the register.As I did so I felt pervade me a splendid, wild, intoxicating buoyancy—a sense of unlimited freedom, of newly attained possibilities.I was just born into the world.The old fetters—whatever they had been—were stricken from my hands and feet.The future lay before me a clear road such as an infant enters, and I could set out upon it equipped with a man’s learning and experience."
"我觉得旅馆接待员多看了我五秒钟。我没有行李。","I thought the hotel clerk looked at me five seconds too long.I had no baggage."
"“我是来参加药剂师大会的，”我说，“我的行李箱不知什么原因还没有到。”我取出一卷钱来。","“The Druggists’ Convention,” I said.“My trunk has somehow failed to arrive.”I drew out a roll of money."
"“啊！”他露出一颗镶金的牙齿，说道，“我们这儿住着很多西部代表。”他摇铃唤来一个服务生。","“Ah!” said he, showing an auriferous tooth, “we have quite a number of the Western delegates stopping here.”He struck a bell for the boy."
"我努力给我的角色增添几分色彩。","I endeavored to give color to my role."
"“我们西部代表中在进行一个重要的运动，”我说，“要向大会建议把装有酒石酸氧锑钾和四水合酒石酸钾钠的瓶子并排放在药架上。”","“There is an important movement on foot among us Westerners,” I said, “in regard to a recommendation to the convention that the bottles containing the tartrate of antimony and potash, and the tartrate of sodium and potash be kept in a contiguous position on the shelf.”"
"“把这位先生领去314号房。”接待员急忙说。我被匆匆领去我的房间。","“Gentleman to three-fourteen,” said the clerk, hastily.I was whisked away to my room."
"第二天，我买了一个行李箱和一些衣服，开始了作为爱德华·平卡汉默的生活。我没有费脑筋努力去解决有关过去的问题。","The next day I bought a trunk and clothing, and began to live the life of Edward Pinkhammer.I did not tax my brain with endeavors to solve problems of the past."
"这个巨大的岛屿城市把一杯翻滚冒泡的烈酒端到我嘴边。我满怀感激地喝下它。曼哈顿的钥匙属于能够承受它们的人。你要么成为这座城市的座上宾，要么就必然得成为它的牺牲品。","It was a piquant and sparkling cup that the great island city held up to my lips.I drank of it gratefully.The keys of Manhattan belong to him who is able to bear them.You must be either the city’s guest or its victim."
"接下来的几天过得酣畅淋漓。爱德华·平卡汉默，自出生以来不过几个小时，就已经体验到了罕有的快乐——那以羽翼丰满、无拘无束之身来到一个如此有趣的世界的快乐。我如痴如醉地坐在由剧院和屋顶花园提供的魔毯上，那魔毯把人送往奇异、愉悦的乐土——那儿满是欢快的音乐，漂亮的女孩和对人类滑稽、诙谐、夸张的模仿。我来来去去完全是按照自己的意愿，不受空间、时间或是行为规范的限制。我在怪诞的歌舞餐厅进餐，在更加怪诞的小餐馆里听着匈牙利音乐和雄辩机智的艺术家、雕塑家们狂野的叫喊就餐。又或者，我置身于如自动放映的电影画面一般的、在灯光下摇曳的夜生活中——世界上各种女帽、珠宝、被这些东西装点的女子，以及使这三者成为可能的男子聚在一起花天酒地、招摇过市。在我所提及的所有这些场景中，我认识到了一件我以前从来不明白的事。那就是，通往自由的钥匙不是掌握在许可证手中，而是由惯例所掌管。礼仪有一道关卡，在那儿你必须付费，否则你就可能进不了自由的乐土。在一片光彩夺目中、在表面的混乱中、在炫耀放纵中，我发现了这条规则。尽管不显眼，然而却像铁律，不容忽视。因此，在曼哈顿，你必须遵守这些不成文的规则，而后你将会得到最大限度的自由。假如你拒绝为这些规则所制约，你就等于为自己戴上了镣铐。","The following few days were as gold and silver.Edward Pinkhammer, yet counting back to his birth by hours only, knew the rare joy of having come upon so diverting a world full-fledged and unrestrained.I sat entranced on the magic carpets provided in theatres and roof-gardens, that transported one into strange and delightful lands full of frolicsome music, pretty girls and grotesque drolly extravagant parodies upon human kind.I went here and there at my own dear will, bound by no limits of space, time or comportment.I dined in weird cabarets, at weirder tables d’hôte to the sound of Hungarian music and the wild shouts of mercurial artists and sculptors.Or, again, where the night life quivers in the electric glare like a kinetoscopic picture, and the millinery of the world, and its jewels, and the ones whom they adorn, and the men who make all three possible are met for good cheer and the spectacular effect.And among all these scenes that I have mentioned I learned one thing that I never knew before.And that is that the key to liberty is not in the hands of License, but Convention holds it.Comity has a toll-gate at which you must pay, or you may not enter the land of Freedom.In all the glitter, the seeming disorder, the parade, the abandon, I saw this law, unobtrusive, yet like iron, prevail.Therefore, in Manhattan you must obey these unwritten laws, and then you will be freest of the free.If you decline to be bound by them, you put on shackles."
"有时，由于受情绪驱使，我会去找富丽堂皇的、种植棕榈的餐厅，并在那里进餐；那里的人们轻声低语，散发着高贵、优雅、克制的气息。此外，我会乘坐汽船下到水路上，和那些大声喧哗、打扮入时、毫无顾忌地卿卿我我的职员们和女售货员们挤在一起，去曼哈顿海滨寻找粗俗的乐子。当然，还有百老汇——光彩夺目、富丽堂皇、诡计多端、变幻莫测、令人心满意足的百老汇——使人就像吸食鸦片上瘾一样越来越喜欢它。","Sometimes, as my mood urged me, I would seek the stately, softly murmuring palm rooms, redolent with high-born life and delicate restraint, in which to dine.Again I would go down to the waterways in steamers packed with vociferous, bedecked, unchecked love-making clerks and shop-girls to their crude pleasures on the island shores.And there was always Broadway—glistening, opulent, wily, varying, desirable Broadway—growing upon one like an opium habit."
"一天下午，我走进我住的旅馆时，一个大鼻子、黑胡子的精壮男人在走廊里挡住了我的去路。当我正要从他身边绕过去时，他用令人不适的亲切向我打招呼。","One afternoon as I entered my hotel a stout man with a big nose and a black mustache blocked my way in the corridor.When I would have passed around him, he greet me with offensive familiarity."
"“你好啊，贝尔福德！”他大声地喊道，“你到底在纽约干什么？我还不知道有什么东西能把你从你那陈旧的书房拽出来呢。贝尔福德太太和你一起来的，还是你自己一个人来办点小事，嗯？”","“Hello, Bellford!” he cried, loudly.“What the deuce are you doing in New York?Didn’t know anything could drag you away from that old book den of yours.Is Mrs. B. along or is this a little business run alone, eh?”"
"“先生，你搞错了，”我冷冷地说道，同时把手从他手中抽出来，“我姓平卡汉默。请见谅。”","“You have made a mistake, sir,” I said, coldly, releasing my hand from his grasp.“My name is Pinkhammer.You will excuse me.”"
"那个人退到走廊的一边，显然吃了一惊。当我向接待员的桌子走去时，我听到他唤来一个服务生并说了些关于电报纸的事。","The man dropped to one side, apparently astonished.As I walked to the clerk’s desk I heard him call to a bell boy and say something about telegraph blanks."
"“你给我结账，”我对接待员说道，“并派人在半小时内把我的行李拿下来。我不喜欢呆在被自以为是的人打扰的地方。”","“You will give me my bill,” I said to the clerk, “and have my baggage brought down in half an hour.I do not care to remain where I am annoyed by confidence men.”"
"那天下午，我搬去了另一家旅馆，一家位于第五大街街尾的、安静的、老式风格的旅馆。","I moved that afternoon to another hotel, a sedate, old-fashioned one on lower Fifth Avenue."
"离百老汇不远处有一家餐馆，在那儿用餐能让人觉得几乎置身户外、身处一排排热带植物群的遮蔽中一样。安静、豪华以及它完美的服务使这个餐馆成为享用午餐或是点心的理想场所。一天下午，当我正在那里的蕨类植物丛中择路而行，去向一张桌子时，我感觉到有人抓住了我的衣袖。","There was a restaurant a little way off Broadway where one could be served almost @al fresco@ in a tropic array of screening flora.Quiet and luxury and a perfect service made it an ideal place in which to take luncheon or refreshment.One afternoon I was there picking my way to a table among the ferns when I felt my sleeve caught."
"“贝尔福德先生！”一个甜美到令人惊艳的声音喊道。","“Mr. Bellford!” exclaimed an amazingly sweet voice."
"我快速转过身来，看到一位女士独自坐着——她30岁左右，有着极其美丽的眼睛，她看着我的眼神好像我曾是她非常亲密的朋友似的。","I turned quickly to see a lady seated alone—a lady of about thirty, with exceedingly handsome eyes, who looked at me as though I had been her very dear friend."
"“你差点就要从我身边走过了，”她嗔怪道，“别跟我说你不认识我。我们为什么不握手呢——15年了，至少该握一握手吧？”","“You were about to pass me,” she said, accusingly.“Don’t tell me you do not know me.Why should we not shake hands—at least once in fifteen years?”"
"我立刻与她握手。我在她那张桌子旁的一把椅子上坐下来，坐在她对面。我扬眉唤来徘徊在近旁的一位服务生。那位女士摆弄着一份冻橙。我点了一杯薄荷甜酒。她的头发是微红的古铜色。你不可能看到它，因为你不能将视线从她的眼睛上移开。但你却能意识到它，就像在黄昏凝望树林深处时，你能意识到太阳下山了一样。","I shook hands with her at once.I took a chair opposite her at the table.I summoned with my eyebrows a hovering waiter.The lady was philandering with an orange ice.I ordered a @crème de menthe@.Her hair was reddish bronze.You could not look at it, because you could not look away from her eyes.But you were conscious of it as you are conscious of sunset while you look into the profundities of a wood at twilight."
"“你确定你认识我？”我问道。","“Are you sure you know me?” I asked."
"“不，”她微笑地说道，“我对此从来都不确定。”","“No,” she said, smiling.“I was never sure of that.”"
"“你会怎么想，”我有点不安地问道，“如果我告诉你，我的名字是爱德华·平卡汉默，来自堪萨斯州的科诺普利斯？”","“What would you think,” I said, a little anxiously, “if I were to tell you that my name is Edward Pinkhammer, from Cornopolis, Kansas?”"
"“我会怎么想？”她重复道，愉快地瞥了我一眼，“唉，你肯定没有带贝尔福德太太一起来纽约。我真希望你有带她来。我多想见见玛丽安啊。”她的声音稍微低了一些，“你没有改变多少，埃尔温。”","“What would I think?” she repeated, with a merry glance.“Why, that you had not brought Mrs. Bellford to New York with you, of course.I do wish you had.I would have liked to see Marian.”Her voice lowered slightly—“You haven’t changed much, Elwyn.”"
"我觉得她那双美目更加仔细地审视着我的眼睛和脸。","I felt her wonderful eyes searching mine and my face more closely."
"“不，你变了。”她修正道，她现在的语气有一种温柔、欢欣鼓舞的调子，“我现在看出来了。你没有忘记。你一年、一天、一个小时也没有忘记。我告诉过你，你决不会忘记的。”","“Yes, you have,” she amended, and there was a soft, exultant note in her latest tones; “I see it now.You haven’t forgotten.You haven’t forgotten for a year or a day or an hour.I told you you never could.”"
"我不安地把吸管戳到薄荷甜酒里。","I poked my straw anxiously in the @crème de menthe@."
"“我的确得请你原谅，”在她的注视下，我感到有点不自在地说道，“但那正是问题所在。我忘记了。我忘记了所有的事。”","“I’m sure I beg your pardon,” I said, a little uneasy at her gaze.“But that is just the trouble.I have forgotten.I’ve forgotten everything.”"
"她无视我的否认。她好像在我脸上看到了什么似的，令她笑得开怀。","She flouted my denial.She laughed deliciously at something she seemed to see in my face."
"“我不时听到有关你的消息，”她继续说道，“你在西部是个大律师——在丹佛，是吗？还是在洛杉矶？玛丽安肯定非常为你骄傲。我想，你知道的，我在你婚后六个月就结婚了。你可能已经在报纸上看到这个消息了。婚礼上光鲜花就花了2000美元。”","“I’ve heard of you at times,” she went on.“You’re quite a big lawyer out West—Denver, isn’t it, or Los Angeles?Marian must be very proud of you.You knew, I suppose, that I married six months after you did.You may have seen it in the papers.The flowers alone cost two thousand dollars.”"
"她已经提过15年了。15年是一段漫长的岁月。","She had mentioned fifteen years.Fifteen years is a long time."
"“会不会太晚了，”我有点畏怯地问道，“现在向你道喜？”","“Would it be too late,” I asked, somewhat timorously, “to offer you congratulations?”"
"“如果你敢的话就不会。”她回答道。她回答的语气那么无畏，以至于我无话可说，于是我开始用拇指甲在桌布上划着折痕。","“Not if you dare do it,” she answered, with such fine intrepidity that I was silent, and began to crease patterns on the cloth with my thumb nail."
"“告诉我一件事，”她说道，十分渴切地向我倾身过来，“一件我多年以来一直想知道的事——当然，仅仅是出于女人的好奇心——自从那夜过后，你敢去碰碰、去闻闻，或者去看看白玫瑰——沾着雨珠和露珠的白玫瑰吗？”","“Tell me one thing,” she said, leaning toward me rather eagerly—“a thing I have wanted to know for many years—just from a woman’s curiosity, of course—have you ever dared since that night to touch, smell or look at white roses—at white roses wet with rain and dew?”"
"我吸了一口薄荷甜酒。","I took a sip of @crème de menthe@."
"“我想，”我叹了口气说道，“让我再说一遍，我对有关这些事的一切都没有印象了，这一点意义都没有吧。我的记忆完全出错了。我没必要多说我对此感到多么遗憾。”","“It would be useless, I suppose,” I said, with a sigh, “for me to repeat that I have no recollection at all about these things.My memory is completely at fault.I need not say how much I regret it.”"
"那位女士把她的胳膊支在桌子上，她的眼神再次对我的话表示蔑视，并且沿着它们自己的路线直直穿向我的灵魂。她轻声笑着，笑声中透着一丝怪异——那是兴高采烈的笑——是的，也是心满意足的笑——还是凄苦的笑。我设法把目光从她身上移开。","The lady rested her arms upon the table, and again her eyes disdained my words and went traveling by their own route direct to my soul.She laughed softly, with a strange quality in the sound—it was a laugh of happiness—yes, and of content—and of misery.I tried to look away from her."
"“你说谎，埃尔温·贝尔福德，”她喜悦地吸了口气说，“哦，我知道你说谎！”","“You lie, Elwyn Bellford,” she breathed, blissfully.“Oh, I know you lie!”"
"我呆呆地望着那些蕨类植物。","I gazed dully into the ferns."
"“我的名字叫爱德华·平卡汉默，”我说，“我和参加药剂师全国代表大会的代表们一起来的。有一项给瓶装酒石酸氧锑钾和四水合酒石酸钾钠安排新位置的运动正在进行，你很可能对此不感兴趣。”","“My name is Edward Pinkhammer,” I said.“I came with the delegates to the Druggists’ National Convention.There is a movement on foot for arranging a new position for the bottles of tartrate of antimony and tartrate of potash, in which, very likely, you would take little interest.”"
"一辆华丽的四轮马车停在了门口。那位女士站了起来。我握住她的手，鞠了一躬。","A shining landau stopped before the entrance.The lady rose.I took her hand, and bowed."
"“我深感抱歉，”我对她说道，“我记不起来了。我可以解释，但恐怕你无法理解。你不会承认我是平卡汉默；而我真的一点也想不起那些——玫瑰以及其他的事。”","“I am deeply sorry,” I said to her, “that I cannot remember.I could explain, but fear you would not understand.You will not concede Pinkhammer; and I really cannot at all conceive of the—the roses and other things.”"
"“再见，贝尔福德先生。”她带着悲喜交加的微笑说道，同时踏上了马车。","“Good-by, Mr. Bellford,” she said, with her happy, sorrowful smile, as she stepped into her carriage."
"那天晚上，我去了剧院。我回到旅馆时，一个穿着黑衣的沉静的男士，魔法般地突然出现在我旁边。他似乎对用丝绸手绢擦指甲很感兴趣。","I attended the theatre that night.When I returned to my hotel, a quiet man in dark clothes, who seemed interested in rubbing his finger nails with a silk handkerchief, appeared, magically, at my side."
"“平卡汉默先生，”他说道，将他主要的注意力集中在他的食指上，“我能请你跟我到一边谈会儿话吗？这儿有一个房间。”","“Mr. Pinkhammer,” he said, giving the bulk of his attention to his forefinger, “may I request you to step aside with me for a little conversation?There is a room here.”"
"“当然可以。”我回答。","“Certainly,” I answered."
"他把我带进一间狭小的私人起居室。一位女士和一位先生在那儿。我猜想，这位女士要不是因极其焦虑和疲劳的表情而显得面容憔悴的话，她会是异常美丽的。她的体态、外貌和面孔都是我喜爱的类型。她身着旅游装束；她流露出十分焦虑的表情、情真意切地凝视着我，用颤抖着的手抚着胸口。我想她就要走向前来了，但那位男士用一个命令的手势阻止了她的动作。接着他自己走向我。他是个40多岁的男子，两鬓微白，脸相坚毅、稳重。","He conducted me into a small, private parlor.A lady and a gentleman were there.The lady, I surmised, would have been unusually good-looking had her features not been clouded by an expression of keen worry and fatigue.She was of a style of figure and possessed coloring and features that were agreeable to my fancy.She was in a traveling dress; she fixed upon me an earnest look of extreme anxiety, and pressed an unsteady hand to her bosom.I think she would have started forward, but the gentleman arrested her movement with an authoritative motion of his hand.He then came, himself, to meet me.He was a man of forty, a little gray about the temples, and with a strong, thoughtful face."
"“贝尔福德，老兄，”他真诚地说道，“我很高兴再次见到你。当然，我们知道，一切都会好起来的。我警告过你，你知道的，你工作过于劳累了。现在，你要和我们一起回去，很快地重新做回你自己。”","“Bellford, old man,” he said, cordially, “I’m glad to see you again.Of course we know everything is all right.I warned you, you know, that you were overdoing it.Now, you’ll go back with us, and be yourself again in no time.”"
"我讥讽地微微一笑。","I smiled ironically."
"我说：“我总是被称为‘贝尔福德’，所以现在听起来已经不那么刺耳了。尽管如此，最终它可能会变得令人厌倦。你愿意完全接受我的名字是爱德华·平卡汉默，在我过去的生命里我从未见过你的假设吗？”","“I have been ‘Bellforded’ so often,” I said, “that it has lost its edge.Still, in the end, it may grow wearisome.Would you be willing at all to entertain the hypothesis that my name is Edward Pinkhammer, and that I never saw you before in my life?”"
"那位男士还未及回答，那位女士便已一阵号啕大哭。她越过那位男士阻拦她的手臂。“埃尔温！”她抽泣着向我扑过来并紧紧地抱住我。“埃尔温，”她又一次喊道，“别伤我的心。我是你的妻子——叫一次我的名字——只要一次就好。与其见你这样，我宁愿看到你死了。”","Before the man could reply a wailing cry came from the woman.She sprang past his detaining arm.“Elwyn!” she sobbed, and cast herself upon me, and clung tight.“Elwyn,” she cried again, “don’t break my heart.I am your wife—call my name once—just once.I could see you dead rather than this way.”"
"我客气但坚决地松开了她的手臂。","I unwound her arms respectfully, but firmly."
"“夫人，”我严肃地说道，“假如我认为你过于草率地认错了人，还请你见谅。遗憾的是，”我继续说道，带着愉悦的笑，因为我突然想到，“这个贝尔福德和我不能像酒石酸氧锑钾和四水合酒石酸钾钠一样，为了便于辨认而被并排放到同一个架子上。为了了解这个比喻的意思，”我愉快地推断道，“你可能需要关注一下药剂师全国代表大会的议程。”","“Madam,” I said, severely, “pardon me if I suggest that you accept a resemblance too precipitately.It is a pity,” I went on, with an amused laugh, as the thought occurred to me, “that this Bellford and I could not be kept side by side upon the same shelf like tartrates of sodium and antimony for purposes of identification.In order to understand the allusion,” I concluded airily, “it may be necessary for you to keep an eye on the proceedings of the Druggists’ National Convention.”"
"那位女士转向她的同伴，紧紧地抓住他的胳膊。","The lady turned to her companion, and grasped his arm."
"“出了什么问题，沃尔尼医生？噢，什么问题？”她呻吟着问。","“What is it, Doctor Volney?Oh, what is it?” she moaned."
"他把她领到门口。","He led her to the door."
"“去你的房间呆一会儿，”我听到他说，“我会留下来和他谈谈。他的大脑？不，我不这么认为——仅仅是大脑的一部分。是的，我确定他会康复的。去你的房间，让我和他呆一会儿。”","“Go to your room for a while,” I heard him say.“I will remain and talk with him.His mind?No, I think not—only a portion of the brain.Yes, I am sure he will recover.Go to your room and leave me with him.”"
"那位女士离开了。穿着黑衣的男士也去了外面，仍然在若有所思地修着指甲。我想他大概在大厅里等着。","The lady disappeared.The man in dark clothes also went outside, still manicuring himself in a thoughtful way.I think he waited in the hall."
"“如果可以的话，我想和你谈一会儿，平卡汉默先生。”那位留下来的先生说道。","“I would like to talk with you a while, Mr. Pinkhammer, if I may,” said the gentleman who remained."
"“非常乐意，如果你想的话，”我回答道，“请见谅，我想坐得舒服些；我实在是太累了。”我在窗边的一张长沙发上舒展开筋骨，并点燃了一支雪茄。他拉了一把椅子到我旁边。","“Very well, if you care to,” I replied, “and will excuse me if I take it comfortably; I am rather tired.”I stretched myself upon a couch by a window and lit a cigar.He drew a chair nearby."
"“我们开门见山讲吧，”他宽慰道，“你不姓平卡汉默。”","“Let us speak to the point,” he said, soothingly.“Your name is not Pinkhammer.”"
"“不仅你知道这一点，我也知道，”我冷冷地说道，“但是一个人总得有个什么名字吧。我向你保证，我并不是十分喜欢平卡汉默这个名字。但是当一个人突然给他自己命名时，那些好名字似乎不会自己蹦出来吧。但是，假设我选的名字是谢林豪森或是斯克罗金斯吧！我想我选平卡汉默这个名字选得很好。”","“I know that as well as you do,” I said, coolly.“But a man must have a name of some sort.I can assure you that I do not extravagantly admire the name of Pinkhammer.But when one christens one’s self suddenly, the fine names do not seem to suggest themselves.But, suppose it had been Scheringhausen or Scroggins!I think I did very well with Pinkhammer.”"
"“你的名字，”那个人严肃地说道，“是埃尔温·C. 贝尔福德。你是丹佛最杰出的律师之一。你正患着失语症，这个病使你忘记了你的身份。病因是你过分专注于你的工作，并且有可能，你的生活中太缺乏正常的休养和乐趣。刚刚离开这个屋子的那位女士是你的妻子。”","“Your name,” said the other man, seriously, “is Elwyn C. Bellford.You are one of the first lawyers in Denver.You are suffering from an attack of aphasia, which has caused you to forget your identity.The cause of it was over-application to your profession, and, perhaps, a life too bare of natural recreation and pleasures.The lady who has just left the room is your wife.”"
"“她是那种我会称之为好看的女士，”我思量片刻后说道，“我特别喜欢她深浅不一的褐色头发。”","“She is what I would call a fine-looking woman,” I said, after a judicial pause.“I particularly admire the shade of brown in her hair.”"
"“她是一位值得为之骄傲的妻子。近两周前，你消失了；自那以后，她几乎没合过眼。我们从伊西多尔·纽曼——一位来自丹佛的旅客发来的电报得知你在纽约。他说他在这儿的一家旅馆里遇见了你，而你却认不出他来。”","“She is a wife to be proud of.Since your disappearance, nearly two weeks ago, she has scarcely closed her eyes.We learned that you were in New York through a telegram sent by Isidore Newman, a traveling man from Denver.He said that he had met you in a hotel here, and that you did not recognize him.”"
"“我想我记得这件事，”我说道，“如果我没弄错的话，那位仁兄称我‘贝尔福德’。但是，难道你不认为，现在是你该介绍你自己的时候了吗？”","“I think I remember the occasion,” I said.“The fellow called me ‘Bellford,’ if I am not mistaken.But don’t you think it about time, now, for you to introduce yourself?”"
"“我是罗伯特·沃尔尼——沃尔尼医生。20年来，我一直是你的密友，并做了你15年的私人医生。我和贝尔福德夫人一收到电报就来找你了。试一试，埃尔温，老兄——设法想起来！”","“I am Robert Volney—Doctor Volney.I have been your close friend for twenty years, and your physician for fifteen.I came with Mrs. Bellford to trace you as soon as we got the telegram.Try, Elwyn, old man—try to remember!”"
"“试有什么用呢？”我眉头微皱地问道，“你说你是个医生。失语症能治好吗？当一个人失去了他的记忆，那记忆是慢慢恢复还是突然就恢复了呢？”","“What’s the use to try?” I asked, with a little frown.“You say you are a physician.Is aphasia curable?When a man loses his memory does it return slowly, or suddenly?”"
"“有时是逐渐恢复的，但恢复得不完全；有时是突然恢复的，就像失去记忆一样突然。”","“Sometimes gradually and imperfectly; sometimes as suddenly as it went.”"
"“你会负责治疗我的病吗，沃尔尼医生？”我问道。","“Will you undertake the treatment of my case, Doctor Volney?” I asked."
"“老朋友，”他说道，“我将会尽我所能、采取一切科学手段来治好你。”","“Old friend,” said he, “I’ll do everything in my power, and will have done everything that science can do to cure you.”"
"“非常好，”我说，“那么你会把我当作你的病人。现在，一切都是秘密了——职业秘密。”","“Very well,” said I.“Then you will consider that I am your patient.Everything is in confidence now—professional confidence.”"
"“当然。”沃尔尼医生说道。","“Of course,” said Doctor Volney."
"我从长沙发上起来。有人把一瓶白玫瑰摆在了房间中央的桌子上—一一束刚洒过水、芳香四溢的白玫瑰。我把它从窗口远远地扔了出去，接着我又躺到了长沙发上。","I got up from the couch.Some one had set a vase of white roses on the centre table—a cluster of white roses, freshly sprinkled and fragrant.I threw them far out of the window, and then I laid myself upon the couch again."
"“博比，”我说，“最好让这病突然好了吧。不管怎样，我对它感到厌烦透了。你现在可以去把玛丽安带进来了。但是，哦，医生，”我朝他的小腿踢了一脚，叹了口气说道，“我的好医生——失语症真是太棒啦！”","“It will be best, Bobby,” I said, “to have this cure happen suddenly.I’m rather tired of it all, anyway.You may go now and bring Marian in.But, oh, Doc,” I said, with a sigh, as I kicked him on the shin—“good old Doc—it was glorious!”"
