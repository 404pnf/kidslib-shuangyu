"最后一片藤叶","The Last Leaf"
"作者：欧·亨利","by O. Henry"
"在华盛顿广场西侧的一个小型街区里，街道发了狂似的延伸，分裂成许多被称之为“街段”的小的条型地段。这些“街段”形成了很多奇特的角度和曲线。一条街道上通常会有一两个十字路口。一位艺术家曾发现这条街有一种珍贵的潜在价值。假设一个收款人带着账单来收颜料、画纸和画布的钱，他会在这条街上转来转去，突然发现自己又回到了原处，却连一分钱的账都没有收到手！","In a little district west of Washington Square the streets have run crazy and broken themselves into small strips called “places.”These “places” make strange angles and curves.One Street crosses itself a time or two.An artist once discovered a valuable possibility in this street.Suppose a collector with a bill for paints, paper and canvas should, in traversing this route, suddenly meet himself coming back, without a cent having been paid on account!"
"因此，搞艺术的人不久就来到了古色古香的格林尼治村。他们在格林泥治村徘徊闲逛，寻找朝北的窗户、十八世纪的三角墙、荷兰式的顶楼房，还有低廉的房租。接着，他们从第六大道运来了一些锡镴制的杯子和一两只火锅，把这地方变成了一个“聚居区”。","So, to quaint old Greenwich Village the art people soon came prowling, hunting for north windows and eighteenth-century gables and Dutch attics and low rents.Then they imported some pewter mugs and a chafing dish or two from Sixth Avenue, and became a “colony.”"
"休和约翰西的画室位于一幢低矮的三层砖房的顶层里。“约翰西”是乔安娜的昵称。她俩一个来自缅因州，一个来自加利福尼亚州。两人是在第八街的一家“德尔莫尼克餐厅”的宾客饭桌上认识的。她们发现彼此在艺术、菊苣色拉和灯笼袖方面的品味是如此相投，于是就有了那间合租的画室。","At the top of a squatty, three-story brick Sue and Johnsy had their studio.“Johnsy” was familiar for Joanna.One was from Maine; the other from California.They had met at the table d'hôte of an Eighth Street “Delmonico’s,” and found their tastes in art, chicory salad and bishop sleeves so congenial that the joint studio resulted."
"那是五月的事了。十一月的时候，一位冷酷无情且又无法见其身的不速之客——医生称其为肺炎，开始在聚居区周围昂首阔步，用他冰冷的手指摸摸这儿，碰碰那儿。在东区重击了大批受害者之后，这个破坏者肆无忌惮地跨了过来，然而，在穿过这些迷宫般的、狭窄而又长满苔藓的“街段”时，他的脚步慢了下来。","That was in May. In November a cold, unseen stranger, whom the doctors called Pneumonia, stalked about the colony, touching one here and there with his icy fingers.Over on the east side this ravager strode boldly, smiting his victims by scores, but his feet trod slowly through the maze of the narrow and moss-grown “places.”"
"肺炎先生可不是你们所说的那种富有骑士精神的老绅士。一个被加利福尼亚的西风吹得不剩什么血色的弱小女子，几乎不是那拳头染血、呼吸短促的老家伙的对手。但他击倒了约翰西。她躺在漆过的铁床上，几乎一动不动，只是透过那荷兰式的小玻璃窗格，望着旁边那座砖房的白墙。","Mr. Pneumonia was not what you would call a chivalric old gentleman.A mite of a little woman with blood thinned by California zephyrs was hardly fair game for the red-fisted, short-breathed old duffer.But Johnsy he smote; and she lay, scarcely moving, on her painted iron bedstead, looking through the small Dutch window-panes at the blank side of the next brick house."
"一天上午，忙碌的医生扬了扬他灰色的浓眉，示意休到走廊里去。","One morning the busy doctor invited Sue into the hallway with a shaggy, gray eyebrow."
"“她的病，可以说，只有十分之一的康复机会，”他边说边把体温计里的水银柱甩了下去，“而这十分之一的机会要靠她想活下去的愿望来争取。那些愿意和殡仪员站在一边的人，用所有的药物都是白费。你家的这位小姐已经断定自己不会好起来了。她有没有什么牵肠挂肚的事啊？”","“She has one chance in—let us say, ten,” he said, as he shook down the mercury in his clinical thermometer.“And that chance is for her to want to live.This way people have of lining-up on the side of the undertaker makes the entire pharmacopoeia look silly.Your little lady has made up her mind that she’s not going to get well.Has she anything on her mind?”"
"“她——她希望有一天能画那不勒斯海湾。”休说。","“She—she wanted to paint the Bay of Naples some day.” said Sue."
"“画画？——真是胡扯！她脑子里有没有值得让她再三琢磨的事——比如说一个男人？”","“Paint?—bosh!Has she anything on her mind worth thinking twice—a man for instance?”"
"“男人？”休用鼻音哼道，仿佛单簧口琴发出的声音一般，“男人就值得吗——不过，没有，医生，没有这样的事。”","“A man?” said Sue, with a jew’s-harp twang in her voice.“Is a man worth—but, no, doctor; there is nothing of the kind.”"
"“嗯，那么，这是个劣势啊。”医生说，“在我的能力范围内，我会倾尽所有的医术来医治她。可要是我的病人开始计算会有多少马车给她送葬，我就得把医药的疗效减掉一半了。如果你有办法让她提一个关于大衣袖子的冬季新款问题，那我可以向你保证，医好她的希望会是五分之一，而不是十分之一。”","“Well, it is the weakness, then,” said the doctor.“I will do all that science, so far as it may filter through my efforts, can accomplish.But whenever my patient begins to count the carriages in her funeral procession I subtract 50 percent from the curative power of medicines.If you will get her to ask one question about the new winter styles in cloak sleeves I will promise you a one-in-five chance for her, instead of one in ten.”"
"医生走后，休走进工作室，把一张日本餐巾纸哭成了一团纸浆。然后，她手里拿着画板，口里吹着拉格泰姆曲调，大摇大摆地走进了约翰西的房间。","After the doctor had gone Sue went into the workroom and cried a Japanese napkin to a pulp.Then she swaggered into Johnsy’s room with her drawing board, whistling ragtime."
"约翰西躺在那里，被子下的身体几乎纹丝不动，脸朝着窗户。休以为她睡着了，停止了吹口哨。","Johnsy lay, scarcely making a ripple under the bedclothes, with her face toward the window.Sue stopped whistling, thinking she was asleep."
"她架好画板，开始为杂志里的故事画钢笔插图。年轻的画家为了铺平通向艺术的道路，不得不为杂志的故事画插图，而这些故事又是年轻的作家为了铺平通向文学的道路而写的。","She arranged her board and began a pen-and-ink drawing to illustrate a magazine story.Young artists must pave their way to Art by drawing pictures for magazine stories that young authors write to pave their way to Literature."
"当休为故事的男主人公，一位爱达荷州牛仔，画他在马匹展览会上穿的精美马裤和单片眼镜时，她听到了一个微弱的声音，这声音重复了好几遍。她快步走到床边。","As Sue was sketching a pair of elegant horseshow riding trousers and a monocle of the figure of the hero, an Idaho cowboy, she heard a low sound, several times repeated.She went quickly to the bedside."
"约翰西的眼睛睁得大大的。她正望着窗外数数——在倒数。","Johnsy’s eyes were open wide.She was looking out the window and counting—counting backward."
"“十二，”她数道，过了一会儿，又说，“十一”，然后是“十”、“九”，接着，几乎同时数出“八”和“七”。","“Twelve,” she said, and little later “eleven”; and then “ten,” and “nine”; and then “eight” and “seven”, almost together."
"休关切地看了看窗外。那儿有什么可数的呢？只见一个空荡沉寂的院子，还有二十英尺之外那间砖房空白的墙壁。一株极老的常春藤，根茎已经扭曲腐烂，其枝干却已攀爬到了半墙高。秋天的寒风吹掉了藤上的叶子，几乎光秃的骨干枝条还紧紧缠附在快要破碎的砖墙上。","Sue look solicitously out of the window.What was there to count?There was only a bare, dreary yard to be seen, and the blank side of the brick house twenty feet away.An old, old ivy vine, gnarled and decayed at the roots, climbed half way up the brick wall.The cold breath of autumn had stricken its leaves from the vine until its skeleton branches clung, almost bare, to the crumbling bricks."
"“在数什么呢，亲爱的？”休问道。","“What is it, dear?” asked Sue."
"“六，”约翰西用近乎耳语的声音说道，“现在它们落得越来越快了。三天前还有差不多一百片呢，数得我头都疼了，不过现在好数了。又掉了一片，现在只剩下五片了。”","“Six,” said Johnsy, in almost a whisper.“They’re falling faster now.Three days ago there were almost a hundred.It made my head ache to count them.But now it’s easy.There goes another one.There are only five left now.”"
"“五片什么啊，亲爱的？告诉你的休迪吧。”","“Five what, dear?Tell your Sudie.”"
"“叶子，常春藤上的叶子。等最后一片叶子掉下来时，我也该去了。这事我三天前就知道了。医生没告诉你吗？”","“Leaves.On the ivy vine.When the last one falls I must go, too.I’ve known that for three days.Didn’t the doctor tell you?”"
"“哦，我可从没听过这种胡话。”休抱怨道，脸上一副嘲笑的表情，“常春藤上的老叶子跟你的病好不好有什么关系？再说你一向很喜欢那棵常春藤啊，你这个淘气的姑娘。别说傻话了。嗨，今天早上医生还告诉我，说你快速康复的机会是——让我想想他的原话——他说，康复的机会是十之八九！哎，那简直跟我们在纽约坐电车或者步行时，走过一幢新房子的机会是一样的。来，喝点肉汤吧，然后让休迪回去画画，她好把它卖给编辑先生，换了钱给她正生病的孩子买点葡萄酒，再给她自己买点猪排解解馋。","“Oh, I never heard of such nonsense,” complained Sue, with magnificent scorn.“What have old ivy leaves to do with your getting well?And you used to love that vine so, you naughty girl.Don’t be a goosey.Why, the doctor told me this morning that your chances for getting well real soon were—let’s see exactly what he said—he said the chances were ten to one!Why, that’s almost as good a chance as we have in New York when we ride on the street cars or walk past a new building.Try to take some broth now, and let Sudie go back to her drawing, so she can sell the editor man with it, and buy port wine for her sick child, and pork chops for her greedy self.”"
"“你不必再买酒了。”约翰西说，两眼盯着窗外，“又掉了一片。不，我不想喝汤。只剩下四片叶子了。我想在天黑之前看到最后一片叶子落下。那时，我也要去了。”","“You needn’t get any more wine,” said Johnsy, keeping her eyes fixed out the window.“There goes another.No, I don’t want any broth.That leaves just four.I want to see the last one fall before it gets dark.Then I’ll go, too.”"
"“约翰西，亲爱的，”休俯身对她说，“你可不可以答应我闭上眼睛，在我画完画之前别看窗外？明天前我必须把那些插图交上去。我需要光线，否则，我就把窗帘拉下来了。”","“Johnsy, dear,” said Sue, bending over her, “will you promise me to keep your eyes closed, and not look out the window until I am done working?I must hand those drawings in by tomorrow.I need the light, or I would draw the shade down.”"
"“你就不能去别的房间画吗？”约翰西冷冷地问。","“Couldn’t you draw in the other room?” asked Johnsy, coldly."
"“我更愿意呆在你身边。”休说，“再说，我不想让你一直盯着那些无聊的常春藤叶子。”","“I’d rather be here by you,” said Sue.“Beside, I don’t want you to keep looking at those silly ivy leaves.”"
"“你一画完就告诉我，”约翰西说着，便闭上了眼睛，她脸色苍白，一动不动地躺着，像一座倒下来的雕像，“因为我想看那最后一片叶子落下来。我等得不耐烦了。我也想得不耐烦了。我想撒手这一切，就像其中一片可怜而又疲倦的叶子一样，飘落下去，落下去。”","“Tell me as soon as you have finished,” said Johnsy, closing her eyes, and lying white and still as fallen statue, “because I want to see the last one fall.I’m tired of waiting.I’m tired of thinking.I want to turn loose my hold on everything, and go sailing down, down, just like one of those poor, tired leaves.”"
"“试着睡一会儿吧。”休说，“我要画个隐居的老矿工，我得把贝尔曼叫上来给我当模特。我一会儿就回来。别动，等我回来啊。”","“Try to sleep,” said Sue.“I must call Behrman up to be my model for the old hermit miner.I’ll not be gone a minute.Don’t try to move ’til I come back.”"
"老贝尔曼是个画家，住在她们下面的一楼。他已年过六旬，长着米开朗基罗雕刻的摩西般的胡子，这胡子长在一颗萨梯（希腊森林之神）的头颅上，又顺着一个小顽童的身体卷曲而下。在艺术方面，贝尔曼是个失败者。四十年来他挥舞着画笔，但仍未触碰到艺术女神的裙边。他总是计划着画出一幅杰作来，但是从来就没动过笔。几年来，他除了时不时地为商业或广告画些拙劣的画外，什么也没画过。他给住在聚居区的那些穷得雇不起职业模特的年轻画家们当模特，以此挣一点钱。他喝杜松子酒喝多了，还会谈起他要画的杰作。除此之外，他还是个暴躁的小老头，他对任何人的软弱都嗤之以鼻，还把自己当成是一条特殊的守卫獒犬，保护楼上画室里那两位年轻的画家。","Old Behrman was a painter who lived on the ground floor beneath them.He was past sixty and had a Michael Angelo’s Moses beard curling down from the head of a satyr along with the body of an imp.Behrman was a failure in art.Forty years he had wielded the brush without getting near enough to touch the hem of his Mistress’s robe.He had been always about to paint a masterpiece, but had never yet begun it.For several years he had painted nothing except now and then a daub in the line of commerce or advertising.He earned a little by serving as a model to those young artists in the colony who could not pay the price of a professional.He drank gin to excess, and still talked of his coming masterpiece.For the rest he was a fierce little old man, who scoffed terribly at softness in any one, and who regarded himself as especial mastiff-in-waiting to protect the two young artists in the studio above."
"休在楼下那间灯光昏暗的小房间里找到贝尔曼时，他浑身正散发着浓重的杜松子酒气。屋内一角的画架上有一张空白的画布，二十五年来一直在等待着接受那幅杰作的第一笔线条。她把约翰西的胡思乱想告诉了他，还说她有多么地害怕当约翰西对这个世界的留恋变得越来越微弱时，约翰西会真的如一片轻轻的、柔弱的叶子一般离世飘走。","Sue found Behrman smelling strongly of juniper berries in his dimly lighted den below.In one corner was a blank canvas on an easel that had been waiting there for twenty-five years to receive the first line of the masterpiece.She told him of Johnsy’s fancy, and how she feared she would, indeed, light and fragile as a leaf herself, float away, when her slight hold upon the world grew weaker."
"老贝尔曼红红的眼睛里明显有泪水流出，他大喊起来，表达着自己对这种愚蠢想法的蔑视与嘲笑。","Old Behrman, with his red eyes plainly streaming, shouted his contempt and derision for such idiotic imaginings."
"“什么！”他大喊道，“世界上真会有人蠢到因为叶子从该死的常春藤上落下而想死吗？我可从没听说过这种事。不，我可不去给你当那傻瓜一样的笨蛋隐士模特。你怎么能允许那么愚蠢的念头进入她脑子里呢？唉，可怜又可爱的约翰西小姐。”","“Vass!” he cried.“Is dere people in de world mit der foolishness to die because leafs dey drop off from a confounded vine?I haf not heard of such a thing.No, I will not bose as a model for your fool hermit-dunderhead.Vy do you allow dot silly pusiness to come in der brain of her?Ach, dot poor leetle Miss Yohnsy.”"
"“她现在病得很厉害，身体很虚弱。”休说，“高烧让她的头脑变得不大正常，满是一些奇怪的想法。好吧，贝尔曼先生，如果你不愿意给我当模特的话，那就算了。不过，我会觉得你是个很讨人厌的老——老啰嗦鬼。”","“She is very ill and weak,” said Sue, “and the fever has left her mind morbid and full of strange fancies.Very well, Mr. Behrman, if you do not care to pose for me, you needn’t.But I think you are a horrid old—old flibbertigibbet.”"
"“你简直像个妇女一样！”贝尔曼大喊道，“谁说我不愿意当模特了？走，我跟你一块儿去。这半个小时我一直在说我愿意当模特啊。老天爷！约翰西小姐这么好的姑娘真不该在这种地方生病。总有一天我会画出一幅杰作，然后我们就都离开这儿。老天爷！一定会的。”","“You are just like a woman!” yelled Behrman.“Who said I will not bose?Go on.I come mit you.For half an hour I haf peen trying to say dot I am ready to bose.Gott!dis is not any blace in which one so goot as Miss Yohnsy shall lie sick.Some day I vill baint a masterpiece, and ve shall all go away.Gott!yes.”"
"他们上楼时，约翰西正在睡觉。休把窗帘拉下来，一直遮到窗台，并示意贝尔曼到另一个房间去。他们在那儿提心吊胆地瞅着窗外的常春藤。然后他们对望了一会儿，什么也没说。一场冷雨持续不断地下着，还夹杂着雪花。贝尔曼身穿他的旧蓝衬衫，像一位隐居的矿工，坐在一把翻过来充当岩石的铁壶上。","Johnsy was sleeping when they went upstairs.Sue pulled the shade down to the window-sill, and motioned Behrman into the other room.In there they peered out the window fearfully at the ivy vine.Then they looked at each other for a moment without speaking.A persistent, cold rain was falling, mingled with snow.Behrman, in his old blue shirt, took his seat as the hermit miner on an upturned kettle for a rock."
"次日清晨，刚睡了一个小时的休醒来后发现，约翰西正大睁着双眼，呆滞地望着拉下来的绿色窗帘。","When Sue awoke from an hour’s sleep the next morning she found Johnsy with dull, wide-open eyes staring at the drawn green shade."
"“把它拉起来，我想看看。”她低声命令道。","“Pull it up; I want to see,” she ordered, in a whisper."
"疲惫的休照她说的做了。","Wearily Sue obeyed."
"但是，瞧啊！经历了整整一夜的暴雨狂风后，仍有一片藤叶依附着砖墙。这是藤上最后一片叶子了。靠近茎部的地方仍是深绿色的，但它锯齿形的边沿已经微染了些枯萎的黄色，它勇敢地悬挂在离地二十多英尺的藤枝上。","But, lo!after the beating rain and fierce gusts of wind that had endured through the livelong night, there yet stood out against the brick wall one ivy leaf.It was the last one on the vine.Still dark green near its stem, with its serrated edges tinted with the yellow of dissolution and decay, it hung bravely from the branch some twenty feet above the ground."
"“这是最后一片了。”约翰西说，“我本以为昨晚它肯定会掉下来的。我听到刮风的声音了。今天它会落下来的，我也会同时死去。”","“It is the last one,” said Johnsy.“I thought it would surely fall during the night.I heard the wind.It will fall to-day, and I shall die at the same time.”"
"“亲爱的，亲爱的！”休说着，将她那憔悴的脸倚到了枕头上，“你不为自己着想，也得想想我吧。我该怎么办啊？”","“Dear, dear!” said Sue, leaning her worn face down to the pillow, “think of me, if you won’t think of yourself.What would I do?”"
"但是约翰西没有回答。全世界最寂寞的事莫过于一个灵魂准备要开始它神秘而遥远的旅程。当她与友谊、尘世之间的纽带被一条条松开时，幻想对她的支配似乎越来越强烈。","But Johnsy did not answer.The lonesomest thing in all the world is a soul when it is making ready to go on its mysterious, far journey.The fancy seemed to possess her more strongly as one by one the ties that bound her to friendship and to earth were loosed."
"白天总算过去了，即使透过暮色，她们还能看到那片孤零零的常春藤叶子牢牢地依附在靠墙的枝干上。接着，黑夜到来，北风又肆无忌惮地刮了起来，雨点不停地敲击着窗户，从低矮的荷兰式屋檐上嗒嗒地滴下。","The day wore away, and even through the twilight they could see the lone ivy leaf clinging to its stem against the wall.And then, with the coming of the night the north wind was again loosed, while the rain still beat against the windows and pattered down from the low Dutch eaves."
"天一亮，冷酷的约翰西就命令把窗帘拉起来。","When it was light enough Johnsy, the merciless, commanded that the shade be raised."
"那片藤叶仍在那里。","The ivy leaf was still there."
"约翰西躺着盯了它好长时间。然后，她叫来正在煤气炉上搅拌鸡汤的休。","Johnsy lay for a long time looking at it.And then she called to Sue, who was stirring her chicken broth over the gas stove."
"“我是个坏女孩，休迪。”约翰西说道，“天意让那最后一片叶子留在那里，好告诉我自己有多可恶。想死是一种罪过。你现在给我拿点汤，再拿些掺了葡萄酒的牛奶，然后——不，先给我拿一面手镜，再给我旁边垫上几个枕头，我要坐起来看你做饭。”","“I’ve been a bad girl, Sudie,” said Johnsy.“Something has made that last leaf stay there to show me how wicked I was.It is a sin to want to die.You may bring me a little broth now, and some milk with a little port in it, and—no; bring me a hand-mirror first, and then pack some pillows about me, and I will sit up and watch you cook.”"
"过了一个小时，她说：","And hour later she said:"
"“休迪，我希望有一天能画那不勒斯的海湾。”","“Sudie, some day I hope to paint the Bay of Naples.”"
"下午，医生来了，休在医生离开时找了个借口来到走廊。","The doctor came in the afternoon, and Sue had an excuse to go into the hallway as he left."
"“有五成康复的机会。”医生说着，握住休那纤细颤抖的手，“好好照顾她，你会成功的。现在我必须去楼下看看另一个病人。他的名字叫贝尔曼——他好像是个画家，我想。也是肺炎。他年纪太大，身体又虚弱，病情还很严重。他的病是医不好了，不过，他今天去医院，是希望能治得好受些。”","“Even chances,” said the doctor, taking Sue’s thin, shaking hand in his.“With good nursing you’ll win.And now I must see another case I have downstairs.Behrman, his name is—some kind of an artist, I believe.Pneumonia, too.He is an old, weak man, and the attack is acute.There is no hope for him; but he goes to the hospital to-day to be made more comfortable.”"
"第二天，医生对休说：“她已经脱离危险了。你成功了。现在，注意些营养，另外悉心照料——那就足够了。”","The next day the doctor said to Sue: “She’s out of danger.You won.Nutrition and care now—that’s all.”"
"那天下午，休来到约翰西躺着的床边，满足地织着一件毫无用处的深蓝色羊毛披肩。休用一只胳膊把她连同枕头等一起抱住。","And that afternoon Sue came to the bed where Johnsy lay, contentedly knitting a very blue and very useless woollen shoulder scarf, and put one arm around her, pillows and all."
"“我有件事要告诉你，小白鼠。”她说，“今天，贝尔曼先生因肺炎在医院去世了。他才病了两天。头天早上，看门的人发现他在楼下自己的房间里痛苦不堪。他的鞋子和衣服都湿透了，冰凉冰凉的。他们怎么也想象不到，在那样一个可怕的夜晚，他究竟去过什么地方。后来，他们发现了一盏仍然亮着的灯笼，一个被挪了位置的梯子，几支散落的画笔，还有一块混着绿色和黄色颜料的调色板，还有——看看窗外，亲爱的，看那墙上的最后一片藤叶。难道你就不奇怪为什么刮风时那片叶子从来不摇不动吗？啊，亲爱的，那是贝尔曼的杰作——就在最后一片叶子落下的那个夜晚，他把它画在了那里。”","“I have something to tell you, white mouse,” she said.“Mr. Behrman died of pneumonia to-day in the hospital.He was ill only two days.The janitor found him the morning of the first day in his room downstairs helpless with pain.His shoes and clothing were wet through and icy cold.They couldn’t imagine where he had been on such a dreadful night.And then they found a lantern, still lighted, and a ladder that had been dragged from its place, and some scattered brushes, and a palette with green and yellow colors mixed on it, and—look out the window, dear, at the last ivy leaf on the wall.Didn’t you wonder why it never fluttered or moved when the wind blew?Ah, darling, it’s Behrman’s masterpiece—he painted it there the night that the last leaf fell.”"
