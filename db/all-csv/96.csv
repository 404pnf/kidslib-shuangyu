"巴格达之鸡","A Bird of Bagdad"
"作者：欧·亨利 ","by O. Henry"
"毫无疑问，哈伦·阿尔·拉希德哈里发的很多精神和天分都遗传到了奥古斯特·迈克尔·冯·保尔森·奎格伯爵身上。","Without a doubt much of the spirit and genius of the Caliph Harun Al Rashid descended to the Margrave August Michael von Paulsen Quigg."
"奎格的饭店坐落于第四大道上——在城市发展的洪流里，这条街道似乎被遗忘了。第四大道——发源和成长于鲍里街——满怀雄心壮志一路蹒跚着向北发展。","Quigg’s restaurant is in Fourth Avenue—that street that the city seems to have forgotten in its growth.Fourth Avenue—born and bred in the Bowery—staggers northward full of good resolutions."
"在穿过第十四大道的地方，它在博物馆和廉价剧院的注目下趾高气扬地走了一小段路。它原本可以成为西边那出身高贵的林阴大道姐妹和东边那通晓多种语言、喧闹繁华且腰圆气阔的堂兄的天造地设的伙伴。它穿过联合广场；驮物的马匹在这里极其默契地踩踏出一阵阵轰隆轰隆声，仿佛在追忆行军时那整齐归一的步伐——万岁！但是现在这里却似寂静可怕的山峦——像堡垒一样的四方的房屋，高耸入云，遮蔽了天空，那里成千上万个奴隶成天弓着背伏案工作。在底层，只有一些水果铺、洗衣店和书店，在书店的橱窗里你可以看到《利特尔现代生活手册》和G. W. M. 雷诺的小说。联合广场的旁边——就是可怜的第四大道！——这条大道陷入了中世纪的孤寂。因为，街道两旁都经营古董的各式商店。","Where it crosses Fourteenth Street it struts for a brief moment proudly in the glare of the museums and cheap theatres.It may yet become a fit mate for its high-born sister boulevard to the west, or its roaring, polyglot, broad-waisted cousin to the east.It passes Union Square; and here the hoofs of the dray horses seem to thunder in unison, recalling the tread of marching hosts—Hooray!But now come the silent and terrible mountains—buildings square as forts, high as the clouds, shutting out the sky, where thousands of slaves bend over desks all day.On the ground floors are only little fruit shops and laundries and book shops, where you see copies of “Littell’s Living Age” and G. W. M. Reynold’s novels in the windows.And next—poor Fourth Avenue!—the street glides into a mediaeval solitude.On each side are shops devoted to “Antiques.”"
"比如说夜幕降临了。披着生锈了的盔甲的人站在橱窗里，高举着生锈的铁护手，虎视眈眈望着来去匆匆的车辆。那些已经随风逝去的英勇军的锁子甲、头盔、大口径短枪、克伦威尔时代的护胸甲、火绳枪、短剑、长剑和匕首在幽灵般的光线下发出微暗的光。时不时有颤颤巍巍的居家市民从亮着南瓜灯或磷光体的街角酒吧里面摇摇晃晃地走出来，他们喝下一大杯啤酒壮胆，来到那条战死者的沾染着鲜血的武器林立两旁的大道，踏上可怕的归程。被这些死一般的遗迹包围着，被这些幽灵般的市民踩踏着，这些市民那早已沉沦的心中没有一丝一毫的欢歌笑语，什么样的街道能生存下来呢？","Let us say it is night.Men in rusty armor stand in the windows and menace the hurrying cars with raised, rusty iron gauntlets.Hauberks and helms, blunderbusses, Cromwellian breastplates, matchlocks, creeses, and the swords and daggers of an army of dead-and-gone gallants gleam dully in the ghostly light.Here and there from a corner saloon (lit with Jack-o’-lanterns or phosphorus), stagger forth shuddering, home-bound citizens, nerved by the tankards within to their fearsome journey adown that loriae avenue lined with the bloodstained weapons of the fighting dead.What street could live inclosed by these mortuary relics, and trod by these spectral citizens in whose sunken hearts scarce one good whoop or tra-la-la remained?"
"第四大道做不到。经历了小里亚尔托戏院区的辉煌和联合广场的响亮鼓声后，第四大道生存不下去了。女士们、先生们：这里不需要眼泪，这只不过是一条街道的自我毁灭而已。伴随一声尖叫和碰撞声，第四大道一头扎进第三十四大道的隧道之中，从此销声匿迹。","Not Fourth Avenue.Not after the tinsel but enlivening glories of the Little Rialto—not after the echoing drum-beats of Union Square.There need be no tears, ladies and gentlemen; ’tis but the suicide of a street.With a shriek and a crash Fourth Avenue dives headlong into the tunnel at Thirty-fourth and is never seen again."
"奎格的小饭店就矗立在这条大道临终凄惨景象的附近。","Near the sad scene of the thoroughfare’s dissolution stood the modest restaurant of Quigg."
"它就站在那里，只要你稍加留意，你就能看到正门处斑斑驳驳的红砖墙正面，堆积满了橙子、西红柿、夹心蛋糕、各种馅饼、罐装芦笋的橱窗，以及橱窗里纸质的龙虾模型和熟睡在一小堆生菜上的两只马耳他猫咪；假如你坐在一张小桌旁，你会看到那因咖啡渍而微微泛黄的桌布，仿佛是日俄战争中日本的行军路线——你坐在那里，一只眼紧盯着雨伞，另一只眼看着那个可恶的骗子、自称是我们亲爱的老朋友和“印度贵族”的老板给我们的冒牌调味汁瓶子。","It stands there yet if you care to view its crumbling red-brick front, its show window heaped with oranges, tomatoes, layer cakes, pies, canned asparagus—its papier-mâché lobster and two Maltese kittens asleep on a bunch of lettuce—if you care to sit at one of the little tables upon whose cloth has been traced in the yellowest of coffee stains the trail of the Japanese advance—to sit there with one eye on your umbrella and the other upon the bogus bottle from which you drop the counterfeit sauce foisted upon us by the cursed charlatan who assumes to be our dear old lord and friend, the “Nobleman in India.”"
"奎格的头衔来源于他的母亲。他母亲的一个祖先是萨克森地区的边疆伯爵夫人。他父亲是坦穆尼的勇士。由于遗传的稀释，他发现他既不能成为有权有势的人，也无法在市政厅谋得一官半职。所以他开了一家饭店。他是个善于思考且博览群书的人。他虽然不太专心经营饭店，但饭店的生意却足以维持他的生计。他家族的一方赋予他一种诗意而浪漫的冒险精神。另一方则赋予他不安于现状的精神，使他积极追寻冒险活动。在白天，他是奎格，一位饭店老板。到了晚上，他就成了边疆伯爵——哈里发——波西米亚王子——在城市的各个角落寻找着一切奇特、神秘、令人费解又深奥静默的事物。","Quigg’s title came through his mother.One of her ancestors was a Margravine of Saxony.His father was a Tammany brave.On account of the dilution of his heredity he found that he could neither become a reigning potentate nor get a job in the City Hall.So he opened a restaurant.He was a man full of thought and reading.The business gave him a living, though he gave it little attention.One side of his house bequeathed to him a poetic and romantic adventure.The other gave him the restless spirit that made him seek adventure.By day he was Quigg, the restaurateur.By night he was the Margrave—the Caliph—the Prince of Bohemia—going about the city in search of the odd, the mysterious, the inexplicable, the recondite."
"一天晚上九点，饭店关了门后，奎格就动身开始了他的探索之旅。","One night at 9, at which hour the restaurant closed, Quigg set forth upon his quest."
"他的外表集外国人、军人和艺术家的气质于一身；他将外衣的扣子一直扣到领口处，紧挨着他那修剪德很短的棕灰色胡须。他出门向西，朝着这座城市的比较热闹的中心区街道走去。","There was a mingling of the foreign, the military and the artistic in his appearance as he buttoned his coat high up under his short-trimmed brown and gray beard and turned westward toward the more central life conduits of the city."
"他口袋里揣着纸卡片，要是没有这些东西，他从不出门。每一张卡片都有不同的面值，凭这些卡片能在他自己的饭店兑换食物。有些只能兑换一碗汤、三明治和咖啡；有些则能让它的持有者免费享用一天、两天、三天，甚至更多天数的全套餐饮；还有些卡可以兑换一顿正餐；实际上，还有为数不多的几张饭券，为持有者提供一周的饭食。","In his pocket he had stored an assortment of cards, written upon, without which he never stirred out of doors.Each of those cards was good at his own restaurant for its face value.Some called simply for a bowl of soup or sandwiches and coffee; others entitled their bearer to one, two, three or more days of full meals; a few were for single regular meals; a very few were, in effect, meal tickets good for a week."
"富裕和权势这两种东西，伯爵奎格都不具有，但是他有着一颗哈里发的心——如果他的才智比上不哈伦·阿尔·拉希德，人们也会原谅他。不过，在巴格达集市上施舍给穷苦人的金币所带来的温暖和希望，也许比不上奎格招待曼哈顿的渔民和独眼托钵僧的炖牛肉那么多。","Of riches and power Margrave Quigg had none; but he had a Caliph’s heart—it may be forgiven him if his head fell short of the measure of Harun Al Rashid’s.Perhaps some of the gold pieces in Bagdad had put less warmth and hope into the complainants among the bazaars than had Quigg’s beef stew among the fishermen and one-eyed calenders of Manhattan."
"在他继续寻求可供他消遣的奇遇或者帮助穷苦人的机会时，奎格留意到百老汇和贯穿全市的街道交叉处聚集了一群欢呼、呐喊、打斗的人。一路匆匆赶到街心，他看见一个极度忧郁的年轻人，心事重重地从口袋里掏出银币，往街心扔去。伴随着年轻人每一次“慷慨解囊”的举动，人群就爆发出一阵欢呼，大家拥挤着去抢落下的赏赐。交通已经中断了。围观人群中，一位警察时不时地屈身疏导挡道者，以使交通恢复畅通。","Continuing his progress in search of romance to divert him, or of distress that he might aid, Quigg became aware of a fast-gathering crowd that whooped and fought and eddied at a corner of Broadway and the crosstown street that he was traversing.Hurrying to the spot he beheld a young man of an exceedingly melancholy and preoccupied demeanor engaged in the pastime of casting silver money from his pockets in the middle of the street.With each motion of the generous one’s hand the crowd huddled upon the falling largesse with yells of joy.Traffic was suspended.A policeman in the centre of the mob stooped often to the ground as he urged the blockaders to move on."
"伯爵一看就意识到，这正是他了解人们不正常心理的机会。他立刻来到年轻人的身边，抓住了他的手臂。“马上跟我来。”他用一种低沉的命令式的语气说道，那种口吻，连他的饭店服务员听到也会感到心惊胆颤。","The Margrave saw at a glance that here was food for his hunger after knowledge concerning abnormal working of the human heart.He made his way swiftly to the young man’s side and took his arm.“Come with me at once,” he said, in the low but commanding voice that his waiters had learned to fear."
"“难住我了，”年轻人抬起头，双目无神，“像无痛手术的牙医那样把我难住了。大人，带我走吧，让我沉沦麻痹吧。有的鸡下蛋，有的鸡不下蛋。那么母鸡什么时候下蛋呢？","“Pinched,” remarked the young man, looking up at him with expressionless eyes.“Pinched by a painless dentist.Take me away, flatty, and give me gas.Some lay eggs and some lay none.When is a hen?”"
"虽然内心还有深深的伤痛，但这年轻人还算孺子可教，他任凭奎格带他离开人群，走到街道尽头，来到一个小公园里。","Still deeply seized by some inward grief, but tractable, he allowed Quigg to lead him away and down the street to a little park."
"他们在公园的一张长椅上坐下，奎格借着伟大的哈里发斗篷之一角（用哈里发的所传的精神），同这个年轻人进行了善意而谨慎的交谈，探寻究竟什么不幸降临其身，什么烦恼搅扰着其灵魂，什么力量驱使他草率行事，对家财这样恣意挥霍浪费。","There, seated on a bench, he upon whom a corner of the great Caliph’s mantle has descended, spake with kindness and discretion, seeking to know what evil had come upon the other, disturbing his soul and driving him to such ill-considered and ruinous waste of his substance and stores."
"“我在扮演基督山伯爵的角色，是吗？”年轻人问。","“I was doing the Monte Cristo act as adapted by Pompton, N. J., wasn’t I?” asked the young man."
"“你方才向人群抛撒银币，人们蜂拥而抢。”伯爵说。","“You were throwing small coins into the street for the people to scramble after,” said the Margrave."
"“没错啊。我喝了许多啤酒，然后把小额钱币扔向街道——噢，诅咒跟鸡有关的字眼，母鸡、鸡毛、公鸡、鸡蛋，诅咒任何和它有关的一切！”","“That’s it.You buy all the beer you can hold, and then you throw chicken feed to—Oh, curse that word chicken, and hens, feathers, roosters, eggs, and everything connected with it!”"
"“年轻人，”伯爵和善的语气中透着威严，“尽管我还没有取得你的信任，但是我希望你畅所欲言。我了解这个世界，也读得懂人性。人就是我的研究对象，虽然我观察一个人并不像科学家观察甲壳虫那么仔细，也不像慈善家看到款项时那么有神采——我在人性的冷漠和罪恶原则中进行我的研究。我对大城市的生活带给我同胞的奇特而复杂的不幸很感兴趣，这是我的乐趣，也是让我放松的事情。或许你对哈里发·阿尔·拉希德光辉不朽的历史谙熟于心，在巴格达人民集体迁徙的过程中，他那英明神武的善行仿佛是他的特权，为人们减轻了许多悲痛。我以谦卑的方式小心翼翼地追随着他的步伐。我在这个城市的街道上寻找着浪漫和神奇——我的冒险不在荒芜的城堡里，也不在断壁残垣的宫殿里。对我而言，当拥挤的人群受到激烈的、多种多样力量作用他们的内心时，他们的心中才产生最大的魔法奇迹。我猜想你今天晚上奇怪的举动一定有原因。在你荒唐而挥霍无度的行为的背后，我解读到了更深刻的含义。我注意到你的表情中有某种大肆消费悲伤和失望的迹象。我再说一遍——我希望你对我开诚布公。我多少还有一些排忧解难和出谋划策的能力。你信不信我？”","“Young sir,” said the Margrave kindly, but with dignity, “though I do not ask your confidence, I invite it.I know the world and I know humanity.Man is my study, though I do not eye him as the scientist eyes a beetle or as the philanthropist gazes at the objects of his bounty—through a veil of theory and ignorance.It is my pleasure and distraction to interest myself in the peculiar and complicated misfortunes that life in a great city visits upon my fellow-men.You may be familiar with the history of that glorious and immortal ruler, the Caliph Harun Al Rashid, whose wise and beneficent excursions among his people in the city of Bagdad secured him the privilege of relieving so much of their distress.In my humble way I walk in his footsteps.I seek for romance and adventure in city streets—not in ruined castles or in crumbling palaces.To me the greatest marvels of magic are those that take place in men’s hearts when acted upon by the furious and diverse forces of a crowded population.In your strange behavior this evening I fancy a story lurks.I read in your act something deeper than the wanton wastefulness of a spendthrift.I observe in your countenance the certain traces of consuming grief or despair.I repeat—I invite your confidence.I am not without some power to alleviate and advise.Will you not trust me?”"
"“天啊，看你说的！”年轻人惊叹着，眼神里的哀伤一时被钦佩取代，眼神微微闪烁。“你把整个阿斯特图书馆说得像是一篇内容梗概。我知道你提到的土耳其人。当我还是个孩子的时候，我就读过《天方夜谭》。土耳其人差不多是比尔戴维和查理叔伯的杂糅体。不过任你怎么对抹布施魔法，从铜瓶里冒出一个黑巨人，折腾一夜也无法将我打动。我的情况你爱莫能助。”","“Gee, how you talk!” exclaimed the young man, a gleam of admiration supplanting for a moment the dull sadness of his eyes.“You’ve got the Astor Library skinned to a synopsis of preceding chapters.I mind that old Turk you speak of.I read ‘The Arabian Nights’ when I was a kid.He was a kind of Bill Devery and Charlie Schwab rolled into one.But, say, you might wave enchanted dishrags and make copper bottles smoke up coon giants all night without ever touching me.My case won’t yield to that kind of treatment.”"
"“我想先听听你的故事。”伯爵高傲而又庄重地笑着说道。","“If I could hear your story,” said the Margrave, with his lofty, serious smile."
"“我的故事几句话就说完，”年轻人叹息一声，说道，“但是，你帮不上我的忙。除非你是个猜谜高手，否则的话你还是坐上你的魔毯回博斯普鲁斯海峡去吧。”","“I’ll spiel it in about nine words,” said the young man, with a deep sigh, “but I don’t think you can help me any.Unless you’re a peach at guessing it’s back to the Bosphorus for you on your magic linoleum.”"
"年轻人和马具师之谜团的故事","The story of the young man and the harness maker’s riddle"
"“我在格兰特大街的一家马鞍马具商店工作。我在那里已经干了5年。我一周挣18美元。挣这些钱结婚已经够了，对吧？然而，我并不打算结婚。那个上了年纪的希尔德布兰德和那些有意思的荷兰人一样——你知道那种类型——总爱开一些下流玩笑。他肚子里有成千上万的谜语以及假冒是从罗杰兄弟的曾祖父那里听来的奇闻轶事。比尔·华生也在那里工作。比尔和我不得不整天忍受那些陈芝麻烂谷子的事儿。为什么我们要那么做？其实，工作并不是遍地都是——何况还有劳拉。","“I work in Hildebrant’s saddle and harness shop down in Grant Street.I’ve worked there five years.I get $18 a week.That’s enough to marry on, ain’t it?Well, I’m not going to get married.Old Hildebrant is one of these funny Dutchmen—you know the kind—always getting off bum jokes.He’s got about a million riddles and things that he faked from Rogers Brothers’ great-grandfather.Bill Watson works there, too.Me and Bill have to stand for them chestnuts day after day.Why do we do it?Well, jobs ain’t to be picked off every Anheuser bush—And then there’s Laura."
"“谁是劳拉？那老头的女儿。她每天都会到店里来。她大约19岁的光景，模样像是莱茵河畔断崖上引诱别人落水的金发女郎。她头发的颜色是稻草席的颜色，她的一对眼睛乌黑明亮，如同最好的马具黑色涂料——想想看！","“What?The old man’s daughter.Comes in the shop every day.About nineteen, and the picture of the blonde that sits on the palisades of the Rhine and charms the clam-diggers into the surf.Hair the color of straw matting, and eyes as black and shiny as the best harness blacking—think of that!"
"“我？有我就没有比尔·华生。她对我们两个人一样好。我吗？——正如你所见，我今晚正在给褐紫红色的大道镀银呢。这一切都是因为劳拉。我非常沮丧，大人，我根本不知道我在干什么。","“Me? Well, it’s either me or Bill Watson.She treats us both equal.Bill is all to the psychopathic about her; and me?—well, you saw me plating the roadbed of the Great Maroon Way with silver to-night.That was on account of Laura.I was spiflicated, Your Highness, and I wot not of what I wouldst."
"“怎么回事？老希尔德布兰德今天下午对比尔和我说：‘小伙子们，我有一个谜语给你们猜。一个不会猜谜语的人，一定也干不好大事业，也就养活不了家庭——你们说是不是？’ 然后我们要猜迷——真是个大难题——他窃笑着，让我们两个明天早上告诉他谜底。他还说，我们俩谁猜对了，星期三晚上谁就能去参加他女儿在家里举行的生日派对。这也就意味着我们中的某一个人可以拥有劳拉，当然是因为劳拉渴望结婚，要么是我，要么就是比尔，而老希尔德布兰德对我们两个都很喜欢，他想在缝制好最后一件马具后，有人能继承他的生意。","“How?Why, old Hildebrandt says to me and Bill this afternoon: ‘Boys, one riddle have I for you gehabt haben.A young man who cannot riddles antworten, he is not so good by business for ein family to provide—is not that—hein?’And he hands us a riddle—a conundrum, some calls it—and he chuckles interiorly and gives both of us till to-morrow morning to work out the answer to it.And he says whichever of us guesses the repartee end of it goes to his house o’ Wednesday night to his daughter’s birthday party.And it means Laura for whichever of us goes, for she’s naturally aching for a husband, and it’s either me or Bill Watson, for old Hildebrant likes us both, and wants her to marry somebody that’ll carry on the business after he’s stitched his last pair of traces."
"“谜题是什么？谜题是这样的：‘哪种鸡下蛋时间最长？想想看！什么鸡下蛋的时间最长？这像不像一个荷兰人用这么蠢的问题拿自己的幸福冒险？但这有什么办法呢？我对鸡了解的太少了。你说你以那个给巴格达图书馆捐赠图书的阿拉伯老家伙为榜样。好吧，现在你能不能吹吹口哨，召唤一个精灵替我解决这个母鸡问题？”","“The riddle?Why, it was this: ‘What kind of a hen lays the longest?’Think of that!What kind of a hen lays the longest?Ain’t it like a Dutchman to risk a man’s happiness on a fool proposition like that?Now, what’s the use?What I don’t know about hens would fill several incubators.You say you’re giving imitations of the old Arab guy that gave away—libraries in Bagdad.Well, now, can you whistle up a fairy that’ll solve this hen query, or not?”"
"年轻人不再说话，伯爵起身在公园的长椅前来来回回踱步，这样过去了几分钟。最终，他再次坐下，用一种严肃又庄重的口吻说道：","When the young man ceased the Margrave arose and paced to and fro by the park bench for several minutes.Finally he sat again, and said, in grave and impressive tones: "
"“先生，我必须承认，在我过去不断追逐传奇、替人排忧解难的8年中，我还从来没有遇到一个比这更为有趣、更为复杂的案子。恐怕在我以往的研究和观察中我忽视了母鸡这一方面。对于它们的习性，它们产卵的次数和行为，以及它们的种类、交配、寿命，它们的——”","“I must confess, sir, that during the eight years that I have spent in search of adventure and in relieving distress I have never encountered a more interesting or a more perplexing case.I fear that I have overlooked hens in my researches and observations.As to their habits, their times and manner of laying, their many varieties and cross-breedings, their span of life, their—” "
"“哦，不要把它弄得像易卜生的话剧似的！”年轻人鲁莽地打断伯爵的话，“谜语——尤其是老黑德的谜语——没有必要猜的那么认真。这些谜语没有什么主题，就如同西姆·福特和哈里·瑟斯顿们喜欢猜的那类谜语一样。但是，不知怎的，我就是想不出答案来。比尔·华生或许能想出答案，或许也不能。明天就能见分晓了。大人，不管怎样，我很高兴你愿意牵扯进来，帮我消磨时光。我猜想如果阿尔·希尔德布兰德先生的一个选民问他这个谜语，他自本人也要退避三舍的。那么告辞晚安了。平安与阁下同在，安拉保佑你。”","“Oh, don’t make an Ibsen drama of it!” interrupted the young man, flippantly.“Riddles—especially old Hildebrant’s riddles—don’t have to be worked out seriously.They are light themes such as Sim Ford and Harry Thurston Peck like to handle.But, somehow, I can’t strike just the answer.Bill Watson may, and he may not.To-morrow will tell.Well, Your Majesty, I’m glad anyhow that you butted in and whiled the time away.I guess Mr. Al Rashid himself would have bounced back if one of his constituents had conducted him up against this riddle.I’ll say good night.Peace fo’ yours, and what-you-may-call-its of Allah.”"
"伯爵伸出手，心情依然被一片阴云笼罩着。","The Margrave, still with a gloomy air, held out his hand."
"“我无从表达我的遗憾，”他闷闷不乐地说，“我以前从未发现过还有我解决不了的事情。‘什么样的鸡下蛋时间最长？’这的的确确是一个让人困惑的问题。我相信，确实有这么一种母鸡叫普利茅斯石，它——”","“I cannot express my regret,” he said, sadly.“Never before have I found myself unable to assist in some way.‘What kind of a hen lays the longest?’It is a baffling problem.There is a hen, I believe, called the Plymouth Rock that—” "
"“别说啦，”年轻人说，“哈里发的交易真是严肃无比啊。我认为你没见识过一个牧师在为约翰·D. 洛克菲勒辩护时的机智幽默。好吧，晚安，大人。”","“Cut it out,” said the young man.“The Caliph trade is a mighty serious one.I don’t suppose you’d even see anything funny in a preacher’s defense of John D. Rockefeller.Well, good night, Your Nibs.”"
"按照习惯，伯爵开始摸他的上衣口袋。他掏出一张卡片，递给年轻人。","From habit the Margrave began to fumble in his pockets.He drew forth a card and handed it to the young man."
"“劳驾，请你一定收下它，”他说，“不知什么时候，这卡片或许能排上用场。”","“Do me the favor to accept this, anyhow,” he said.“The time may come when it might be of use to you.”"
"“谢啦！”年轻人说着，漫不经心地收起卡片，“我叫西蒙。”","“Thanks!” said the young man, pocketing it carelessly.“My name is Simmons.”"
"如果有谁暗示说读者们的兴趣应紧紧追随着奎格而转移，那他就错了。事实上，我要“误入歧途”一小会儿，我这握着笔的手实在跟不上我的伯爵追随者们的心意了。那么，让我们立马去看看第二天在黑徳博莱特的房里要发生什么事了呢。","Shame to him who would hint that the reader’s interest shall altogether pursue the Margrave August Michael von Paulsen Quigg.I am indeed astray if my hand fail in keeping the way where my peruser’s heart would follow.Then let us, on the morrow, peep quickly in at the door of Hildebrant, harness maker."
"体重两百磅的希尔德布兰德坐在长凳上，往一条生牛皮的缰上钉银扣。","Hildebrant’s 200 pounds reposed on a bench, silver-buckling a raw leather martingale."
"比尔·华生首先进屋。","Bill Watson came in first."
"“怎么样？”爱开玩笑的希尔德布兰德悠悠地问，笑得浑身肥肉颤抖，“你有没有猜出来？‘哪种鸡下蛋时间最长啊？’”","“Vell,” said Hildebrant, shaking all over with the vile conceit of the joke-maker, “haf you guessed him?‘Vat kind of a hen lays der longest? ’” "
"“呃，这个嘛——我觉得是，”比尔一边说一边卑躬屈膝地挠着下巴。“我觉得是，希尔德布兰德先生——是寿命最长的鸡——我说的对吗？”","“Er—why, I think so,” said Bill, rubbing a servile chin.“I think so, Mr. Hildebrant—the one that lives the longest—Is that right?”"
"“不对！”希尔德布兰德急剧地摇着头。“你猜得不对。”","“Nein!” said Hildebrant, shaking his head violently.“You haf not guessed der answer.”"
"比尔没有希望了，只能系上干活的围裙做个单身汉了。","Bill passed on and donned a bed-tick apron and bachelorhood."
"现在轮到那个阿拉伯之夜的惨败英雄了——苍白、忧郁、毫无希望。","In came the young man of the Arabian Night’s fiasco—pale, melancholy, hopeless."
"“现在，”希尔德布兰德问，“你猜出来了吗？‘什么鸡下蛋时间最长啊？’”","“Vell,” said Hildebrant, “haf you guessed him?‘Vat kind of a hen lays der longest?’”"
"西门呆滞地望着他，眼神里充满了一股蛮劲。他应不应该诅咒他这不着边际又毫无益处的幽默——诅咒他去死呢？何必这样呢——一切都是为了劳拉。","Simmons regarded him with dull savagery in his eye.Should he curse this mountain of pernicious humor—curse him and die?Why should—But there was Laura."
"他哑口无言、走投无路，他直直站立着，突然，他把手插进上衣口袋。他的手奇妙地触摸到了伯爵的卡片。他拿出来并看上面有些什么，仿佛一个垂死挣扎之人，在绞刑前再看一眼横飞的流蝇。上面有奎格圆乎乎的字迹写道：“持卡人可领取一只烤鸡。”","Dogged, speechless, he thrust his hands into his coat pockets and stood.His hand encountered the strange touch of the Margrave’s card.He drew it out and looked at it, as men about to be hanged look at a crawling fly.There was written on it in Quigg’s bold, round hand: “Good for one roast chicken to bearer.”"
"西蒙抬起头，眼睛流光溢彩。","Simmons looked up with a flashing eye."
"“死鸡！”他说。","“A dead one!” said he."
"“真棒！”西德尔布兰德几近咆哮，笑声震得桌子都动摇了。“你答对了！今晚八点来我家里参加生日派对。”","“Goot!” roared Hildebrant, rocking the table with giant glee.“Dot is right!You gome at mine house at 8 o’clock to der party.”"
