"爱的牺牲","A SERVICE OF LOVE"
"作者：欧·亨利","by O. Henry"
"当一个人爱着自己的艺术时，做出什么牺牲都不难。","When one loves one’s Art no service seems too hard."
"这是我们这个故事的前提。这个故事将从此前提中得出结论，同时证明这个前提是错的。从逻辑上来说，这算得上一个新鲜的事物，但从说书的观点看，这是一次比中国万里长城的历史还要悠久些的壮举。","That is our premise.This story shall draw a conclusion from it, and show at the same time that the premise is incorrect.That will be a new thing in logic, and a feat in story-telling somewhat older than the great wall of China."
"乔·拉腊比来自美国中西部盛产星毛栎的大平原，他浑身散发着一股绘画艺术的天才气息。在他六岁那年，他给镇上的抽水机画了幅画，画中，一位显赫一时的人正匆匆走过抽水机。这幅画被裱到框里，挂在药店的橱窗里，旁边是参差不齐的几排玉米穗。二十岁的时候，他去了纽约，领带松松垮垮地系着，钱包倒是系得紧一些。","Joe Larrabee came out of the post-oak flats of the Middle West pulsing with a genius for pictorial art.At six he drew a picture of the town pump with a prominent citizen passing it hastily.This effort was framed and hung in the drug store window by the side of the ear of corn with an uneven number of rows.At twenty he left for New York with a flowing necktie and a capital tied up somewhat closer."
"迪莉娅·卡拉瑟斯生活在南方一个松树环绕的小村子里。由于觉得她在六音阶方面发展会很有希望，亲戚们给她筹够了钱，让她到“北方”去“有所作为”。他们没能看到她有所——可这就是我们要讲的故事。","Delia Caruthers did things in six octaves so promisingly in a pine-tree village in the South that her relatives chipped in enough in her chip hat for her to go “North” and “finish.”They could not see her f—, but that is our story."
"乔和迪莉娅是在一个工作室里遇见的。许多学习艺术和音乐的学生聚集在那里，他们讨论明暗对照法，瓦格纳，音乐，伦勃朗的作品，画作，瓦尔德特伊费尔，墙纸，肖邦以及乌龙茶等等。","Joe and Delia met in an atelier where a number of art and music students had gathered to discuss chiaroscuro, Wagner, music, Rembrandt’s works, pictures, Waldteufel, wall paper, Chopin and Oolong."
"乔和迪莉娅渐渐地爱上了对方，或者是彼此，随便你怎么说，没过多久，他们结婚了——因为（见上文），当一个人爱着自己的艺术时，做出什么牺牲都不难。","Joe and Delia became enamoured one of the other, or each of the other, as you please, and in a short time were married—for (see above), when one loves one’s Art no service seems too hard."
"拉腊比夫妇在一套公寓里开始了他们的生活。那是一套孤零零的公寓——孤单得正如键盘上左手边的Ａ高半音。但他们是幸福的，因为他们有自己的艺术，还有彼此。我对有钱的年轻人的建议是——卖掉你所拥有的一切，把它们施舍给可怜的看门人，这样，你就可以和你的艺术以及你的迪莉娅居住在公寓里。","Mr. and Mrs. Larrabee began housekeeping in a flat.It was a lonesome flat—something like the A sharp way down at the left-hand end of the keyboard.And they were happy; for they had their Art, and they had each other.And my advice to the rich young man would be—sell all thou hast, and give it to the poor janitor for the privilege of living in a flat with your Art and your Delia."
"住在公寓里的人应该同意我的看法，那就是他们的生活才是唯一的、真正的幸福。如果一个家庭是幸福的，再怎么拥挤都会觉得很合适——让梳妆台倒下变成台球桌；让壁炉架变成划船器，写字桌变成备用的卧榻，洗脸架变成竖式钢琴；如果四面墙愿意的话，还可以让它们靠拢到一起，你和你的迪莉娅就生活在里面。但若一个家庭不幸福，房子再宽敞又能怎样——从金门进去，帽子挂在哈特勒斯，披肩挂在好望角，再从拉布拉多出来。","Flat-dwellers shall indorse my dictum that theirs is the only true happiness.If a home is happy it cannot fit too close—let the dresser collapse and become a billiard table; let the mantel turn to a rowing machine, the escritoire to a spare bedchamber, the washstand to an upright piano; let the four walls come together, if they will, so you and your Delia are between.But if home be the other kind, let it be wide and long—enter you at the Golden Gate, hang your hat on Hatteras, your cape on Cape Horn and go out by the Labrador."
"乔在大画师马吉斯特门下学画画——你是知道他的名望的。他收费高，课程很轻松——正是这种高学费的轻松课程给他带来了声望。迪莉娅在罗森斯托克门下学习——他因专门倒腾钢琴键盘而出名。","Joe was painting in the class of the great Magister—you know his fame.His fees are high; his lessons are light—his high-lights have brought him renown.Delia was studying under Rosenstock—you know his repute as a disturber of the piano keys."
"只要钱还能维持生计，他们的生活就是非常幸福的。每个家庭都是这样——但我不愿说什么愤世嫉俗的话。他们有着清晰明确的目标。乔的目标就是很快能画出作品，能让那些两鬓胡须稀少但钱包鼓鼓的老先生们接连不断地涌入他的画室争相购买。迪莉娅的目标是在搞透音乐后对其不屑一顾，当看到头等厢位未坐满时，她能以喉咙痛为由拒绝登台，而在私人专用餐厅里享用龙虾。","They were mighty happy as long as their money lasted.So is every—but I will not be cynical.Their aims were very clear and defined.Joe was to become capable very soon of turning out pictures that old gentlemen with thin side-whiskers and thick pocketbooks would sandbag one another in his studio for the privilege of buying.Delia was to become familiar and then contemptuous with Music, so that when she saw the orchestra seats and boxes unsold she could have sore throat and lobster in a private dining-room and refuse to go on the stage."
"但在我看来，最不错的还是在狭小的公寓里的家庭生活——一天的学习结束后热烈而畅快的交谈，温馨的晚餐和新鲜、清淡的早餐；还有关于抱负的交流——那是交织着彼此梦想的抱负，否则就微不足道了——他们互相帮助并给予对方灵感；还有——原谅我的简单——晚上11点的填馅橄榄和奶酪三明治。","But the best, in my opinion, was the home life in the little flat—the ardent, voluble chats after the day’s study; the cozy dinners and fresh, light breakfasts; the interchange of ambitions—ambitions interwoven each with the other’s or else inconsiderable—the mutual help and inspiration; and—overlook my artlessness—stuffed olives and cheese sandwiches at 11 p.m."
"但是不久之后，艺术变得枯燥无味了。有时事情就是这样的，即使没有人明着说出来。正如俗话所说，他们的生活陷入了只出不进的状态。他们已经没有钱支付马吉斯特先生和赫尔·罗森斯托克先生的学费了。当一个人爱着自己的艺术时，做出什么牺牲都不难。于是，迪莉娅说她要去教音乐课以保证家里能揭开锅。","But after a while Art flagged.It sometimes does, even if some switchman doesn’t flag it.Everything going out and nothing coming in, as the vulgarians say.Money was lacking to pay Mr. Magister and Herr Rosenstock their prices.When one loves one’s Art no service seems too hard.So, Delia said she must give music lessons to keep the chafing dish bubbling."
"接下来的两三天，她一直在外招揽学生。一天晚上，她兴高采烈地回来了。","For two or three days she went out canvassing for pupils.One evening she came home elated."
"“亲爱的乔，”她高兴地说，“我招到了一个学生。噢，那家人可真是太好了！一位将军——A. B. 平克尼将军的女儿——住在第71街。多么漂亮的房子，乔——你应该去看看那房子的大门！我想你该会把它称为拜占庭式的。还有房子里！噢，乔，我从来没见过那样的东西。”","“Joe, dear,” she said, gleefully, “I’ve a pupil.And, oh, the loveliest people!General—General A. B. Pinkney’s daughter—on Seventy-first street.Such a splendid house, Joe—you ought to see the front door!Byzantine I think you would call it.And inside!Oh, Joe, I never saw anything like it before."
"“我的学生就是将军的女儿，克莱门蒂娜。我已经深深地喜欢上她了。她是那么地优雅——总穿一身白；还有，他那简单而又可爱的举止！她才十八岁。我一周给她上三次课，想想看，乔！一次课五美元。但我一点都不介意；等我再招到两三个学生，我就又可以继续跟着赫尔·罗森斯托克先生上课了。现在，别再皱着眉头啦，亲爱的，让我们好好吃顿晚饭吧。”","“My pupil is his daughter Clementina.I dearly love her already.She’s a delicate thing—dresses always in white; and the sweetest, simplest manners!Only eighteen years old.I’m to give three lessons a week; and, just think, Joe!$5 a lesson.I don’t mind it a bit; for when I get two or three more pupils I can resume my lessons with Herr Rosenstock.Now, smooth out that wrinkle between your brows, dear, and let’s have a nice supper.”"
"“迪莉，这对你来说是很不错了。”乔边说边用切肉刀和小斧打开一罐豌豆，“但是我呢？你认为我会让你到处奔走赚钱，而我还在高雅的艺术领域里调情吗？我在本韦努托·切利尼的骸骨前起誓，绝对不行！我想我可以去卖报纸，或是去铺石子路，怎么也能挣个一两美元。”","“That’s all right for you, Dele,” said Joe, attacking a can of peas with a carving knife and a hatchet, “but how about me?Do you think I’m going to let you hustle for wages while I philander in the regions of high art?Not by the bones of Benvenuto Cellini!I guess I can sell papers or lay cobblestones, and bring in a dollar or two.”"
"迪莉娅走过去，搂住他的脖子。","Delia came and hung about his neck."
"“乔，亲爱的，你真傻。你一定要继续学习。我并不是放弃了音乐去做一些其他的工作。在教音乐的同时，我也在学习。我一直都没有离开音乐。就算每周只有15美元，我们仍然可以过得像百万富翁一样快乐。你千万不能有离开马吉斯特先生的念头。”","“Joe, dear, you are silly.You must keep on at your studies.It is not as if I had quit my music and gone to work at something else.While I teach I learn.I am always with my music.And we can live as happily as millionaires on $15 a week.You mustn’t think of leaving Mr. Magister.”"
"“好吧，”乔说，伸手去拿那个蓝色的扇形菜碟，“但我不喜欢你去教音乐课。那不是艺术。但是你这么做真是对我太好了。”","“All right,” said Joe, reaching for the blue scalloped vegetable dish.“But I hate for you to be giving lessons.It isn’t Art.But you’re a trump and a dear to do it.”"
"“当一个人爱着自己的艺术时，做出什么牺牲都不难。”迪莉娅说。","“When one loves one’s Art no service seems too hard,” said Delia."
"“我那幅在公园完成的素描得到了马吉斯特的称赞，他说天空画得不错。”乔说。“丁克尔也答应会在他的橱窗里挂上两幅我的画。要是正好碰上哪个有钱的傻瓜看见它们，我就能卖掉一幅。”","“Magister praised the sky in that sketch I made in the park,” said Joe.“And Tinkle gave me permission to hang two of them in his window.I may sell one if the right kind of a moneyed idiot sees them.”"
"“我相信你一定可以的。”迪莉娅温柔地说。“现在让我们来谢谢平克尼将军和这顿烤乳牛肉吧。”","“I’m sure you will,” said Delia, sweetly.“And now let’s be thankful for Gen. Pinkney and this veal roast.”"
"接下来的一整周，拉腊比夫妇每天一大早就吃早饭。乔兴致勃勃地到中央公园画几张清晨素描。7点，迪莉娅会给他做好早饭，拥抱、称赞、亲吻后，送他出家门。艺术是一位迷人的情妇。他通常晚上7点才回来。","During all of the next week the Larrabees had an early breakfast.Joe was enthusiastic about some morning-effect sketches he was doing in Central Park, and Delia packed him off breakfasted, coddled, praised and kissed at 7 o’clock.Art is an engaging mistress.It was most times 7 o’clock when he returned in the evening."
"周末，迪莉娅觉得有些甜蜜、有些自豪，但也有些疲惫。她得意洋洋地把三张五块钱的钞票扔在那8英尺宽、10英尺长的客厅中间的那张8英寸宽、10英寸长的桌子上。","At the end of the week Delia, sweetly proud but languid, triumphantly tossed three five-dollar bills on the 8×10 (inches) centre table of the 8×10 (feet) flat parlour."
"“有时候，”她有些疲倦地说，“克莱门蒂娜真是很考验我。我担心她练得不够。而且同样的事情我得屡次三番说好几遍。还有，她总是穿一身白，太单调了。但是平克尼将军真的是一位特别亲切的老头！我希望你可以认识他，乔。有时候我和克莱门蒂娜在练钢琴，他会走进来——你知道，他是个鳏夫——他就站在那儿捋着他的白胡子。‘十六分音符和三十二分音符学得怎么样了？’他老是这么问。”","“Sometimes,” she said, a little wearily, “Clementina tries me.I’m afraid she doesn’t practise enough, and I have to tell her the same things so often.And then she always dresses entirely in white, and that does get monotonous.But Gen. Pinkney is the dearest old man!I wish you could know him, Joe.He comes in sometimes when I am with Clementina at the piano—he is a widower, you know—and stands there pulling his white goatee.‘And how are the semiquavers and the demisemiquavers progressing?’ he always asks.”"
"“我希望你可以看到那个画室里的壁板，乔！还有那些阿斯特拉罕的皮门帘。克莱门蒂娜总有些异样的咳嗽。我希望她比表面上更强壮些。噢，我真是越来越喜欢她了。她那么温柔，那么有教养。平克尼将军的弟弟还曾任过驻玻利维亚的大使呢。”","“I wish you could see the wainscoting in that drawing-room, Joe!And those Astrakhan rug portières.And Clementina has such a funny little cough.I hope she is stronger than she looks.Oh, I really am getting attached to her, she is so gentle and high bred.Gen. Pinkney’s brother was once Minister to Bolivia.”"
"听完这些后，乔带着一副基督山伯爵的神情，掏出一张十块、一张五块、一张两块和一张一块的纸币——全是法定的纸币——把它们放在迪莉娅挣的钱旁边。","And then Joe, with the air of a Monte Cristo, drew forth a ten, a five, a two and a one—all legal tender notes—and laid them beside Delia’s earnings."
"“那幅方尖碑的水彩画卖给了一个来自皮奥里亚的人。”他气宇轩昂地说。","“Sold that watercolour of the obelisk to a man from Peoria,” he announced overwhelmingly."
"“别跟我开玩笑了，”迪莉娅说，“他不是来自皮奥里亚吧！”","“Don’t joke with me,” said Delia, “not from Peoria!”"
"“绝对是。我希望你可以见见他，迪莉。他胖胖的，围着一条羊毛围巾，嘴里叼着根羽毛做的牙签。他看到了丁克尔橱窗里的素描，一开始以为那是风车。但他很感兴趣，买下了那幅画。他还预定了另外一幅——那幅拉克万纳货运站的油画——打算带回家。音乐课！噢，我想这其中还是存在艺术的。“","“All the way.I wish you could see him, Dele.Fat man with a woollen muffler and a quill toothpick.He saw the sketch in Tinkle’s window and thought it was a windmill at first.He was game, though, and bought it anyhow.He ordered another—an oil sketch of the Lackawanna freight depot—to take back with him.Music lessons!Oh, I guess Art is still in it.”"
"“看到你能坚持下来，我好高兴，”迪莉娅发自内心地说。“你一定会成功的，亲爱的。三十块钱！我们从来没有过这么多钱可以花。今晚我们吃牡蛎吧。”","“I’m so glad you’ve kept on,” said Delia, heartily.“You’re bound to win, dear.Thirty-three dollars!We never had so much to spend before.We’ll have oysters tonight.”"
"“还有嫩肉片和香菇，”乔说，“那把橄榄色的叉子呢？”","“And filet mignon with champignons,” said Joe.“Where is the olive fork?”"
"下一个周六的晚上，乔先回到家。他把十八块钱铺开在客厅的桌子上，然后洗掉手上许多似乎是黑色颜料的东西。","On the next Saturday evening Joe reached home first.He spread his $18 on the parlour table and washed what seemed to be a great deal of dark paint from his hands."
"半小时后，迪莉娅回来了，右手缠着一团难看的绷带。","Half an hour later Delia arrived, her right hand tied up in a shapeless bundle of wraps and bandages."
"“这是怎么回事？”乔像往常一样打了招呼后问道。迪莉娅笑了，但不是开心地笑。","“How is this?” asked Joe after the usual greetings.Delia laughed, but not very joyously."
"“克莱门蒂娜，”她解释道，“下课后坚持要吃威尔士干酪。她真是个奇怪的姑娘。下午五点想吃威尔士干酪。将军也在那儿。乔，你该去看看他冲过去拿保温锅的样子，就好像家里没有佣人一样。我知道克莱门蒂娜身体不好；她神经总是很紧张。她把干酪端过来的时候，撒了很多，滚烫滚烫的干酪撒到了我的手上和手腕上。好痛啊，乔。那个可爱的小女孩也很内疚。但是平克尼将军！——乔，那个老头几乎要发狂了。他冲下楼去派人——他们说是烧炉子的或是地下室里的某个人——到药店去买油和其他一些包扎用的东西。现在倒不那么痛了。”","“Clementina,” she explained, “insisted upon a Welsh rabbit after her lesson.She is such a queer girl.Welsh rabbits at 5 in the afternoon.The General was there.You should have seen him run for the chafing dish, Joe, just as if there wasn’t a servant in the house.I know Clementina isn’t in good health; she is so nervous.In serving the rabbit she spilled a great lot of it, boiling hot, over my hand and wrist.It hurt awfully, Joe.And the dear girl was so sorry!But Gen.Pinkney!—Joe, that old man nearly went distracted.He rushed downstairs and sent somebody—they said the furnace man or somebody in the basement—out to a drug store for some oil and things to bind it up with.It doesn’t hurt so much now.”"
"“这是什么？”乔问，他轻轻地抬起迪莉娅的手，指着绷带下面的一些白线。","“What’s this?” asked Joe, taking the hand tenderly and pulling at some white strands beneath the bandages."
"“那是一些软纱之类的东西，”迪莉娅说，“那上面有油。喔，乔，你又卖出去一幅画吗？”她早看到桌上的钱了。","“It’s something soft,” said Delia, “that had oil on it.Oh, Joe, did you sell another sketch?”She had seen the money on the table."
"“我吗？”乔说，“去问问那个从皮奥里亚来的人就知道了。他今天取走了那幅货运站的画，虽然他还不确定，但他觉得他还想要一幅公园风景图和一幅哈得孙河上的风景图。你下午什么时候烫到手的，迪莉？”","“Did I?” said Joe; “just ask the man from Peoria.He got his depot today, and he isn’t sure but he thinks he wants another parkscape and a view on the Hudson.What time this afternoon did you burn your hand, Dele?”"
"“大概五点吧，”迪莉娅可怜地说。“熨斗——我的意思是那滚烫的干酪就是那时候端下来的。你真该看到平克尼将军，乔，当时——”","“Five o’clock, I think,” said Dele, plaintively.“The iron—I mean the rabbit came off the fire about that time.You ought to have seen Gen.Pinkney,Joe, when—”"
"“在这坐会儿吧，迪莉。”乔说。他把她拉到沙发那儿，坐在她旁边，手臂围在她肩膀上。","“Sit down here a moment, Dele,” said Joe.He drew her to the couch, sat beside her and put his arm across her shoulders."
"“过去这两周你都做什么去了，迪莉？”他问。","“What have you been doing for the last two weeks, Dele?” he asked."
"有那么一两分钟，她放大胆子坚持以前的说法，眼里带着爱意和倔强，含糊不清地说了一两句关于平克尼将军的话；但最后，她低下头，哭着说出了事情的真相。","She braved it for a moment or two with an eye full of love and stubbornness, and murmured a phrase or two vaguely of Gen.Pinkney; but at length down went her head and out came the truth and tears."
"“我一个学生也招不到，”她坦白地说，“但我不忍让你放弃你的课程，所以我在第二十四街的洗衣店找了个熨衣服的工作。我以为我把平克尼将军和克莱门蒂娜的故事编得很好呢，不是吗，乔？今天下午，洗衣店里的一个小姑娘把热熨斗搁在了我手上，回来的路上我一直在编那个威尔士干酪的故事。你不会生我的气吧，乔？要是我没找到这份工作，你也许就不能把素描卖给那个从皮奥里亚来的人了。”","“I couldn’t get any pupils,” she confessed.“And I couldn’t bear to have you give up your lessons; and I got a place ironing shirts in that big Twenty-fourth street laundry.And I think I did very well to make up both General Pinkney and Clementina, don’t you, Joe?And when a girl in the laundry set down a hot iron on my hand this afternoon I was all the way home making up that story about the Welsh rabbit.You’re not angry, are you, Joe?And if I hadn’t got the work you mightn’t have sold your sketches to that man from Peoria.”"
"“他不是从皮奥里亚来的。”乔慢吞吞地说。","“He wasn’t from Peoria,” said Joe, slowly."
"“好吧，不管他来自哪儿。乔，你多聪明呀——吻我吧，乔——是什么让你怀疑我不是在给克莱门蒂娜上课呢？”","“Well, it doesn’t matter where he was from.How clever you are, Joe—and—kiss me, Joe—and what made you ever suspect that I wasn’t giving music lessons to Clementina?”"
"“我之前也没怀疑，”乔说，“直到今晚。本来今晚我也不会怀疑的，只是今天下午，我把机器房里的废棉布和油给了楼上一个被熨斗烫伤的姑娘。过去的两个星期里，我一直在那家洗衣店里烧锅炉。”","“I didn’t,” said Joe, “until tonight.And I wouldn’t have then, only I sent up this cotton waste and oil from the engine-room this afternoon for a girl upstairs who had her hand burned with a smoothing-iron.I’ve been firing the engine in that laundry for the last two weeks.”"
"“这么说，你没有——”","“And then you didn’t—”"
"“那个从皮奥里亚来的顾客，”乔说，“和平克尼将军都是源于同一艺术的创造——但你不能称它为绘画或音乐。”","“My purchaser from Peoria,” said Joe, “and Gen. Pinkney are both creations of the same art—but you wouldn’t call it either painting or music.”"
"然后他们都笑了，乔开始说：","And then they both laughed, and Joe began:"
"“当一个人爱着自己的艺术时，做出什么牺牲都——”","“When one loves one’s Art no service seems—”"
"但是迪莉娅用手捂住了他的嘴。“别说了，”她说，“只说‘当一个人爱着的时候。’”","But Delia stopped him with her hand on his lips.“No,” she said—“just ‘When one loves.’”"
