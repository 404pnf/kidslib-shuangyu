"轮到她了","Her Turn"
"作者：戴维·赫伯特·劳伦斯","by D. H. Lawrence"
"她是他的第二任妻子，因此他们之间有种一个男人和他的第一个女人所无法拥有的和平关系。","She was his second wife, and so there was between them that truce which is never held between a man and his first woman."
"他是值得女人托付终生的男人。就这点而言，他在矿工中是个例外。邻家的妇女们尽管过分拘谨，但是都挺喜欢他。他身材高大，为人淳朴，对她们彬彬有礼，甚至对自己的第二个妻子也是这样。","He was one for the women, and as such, an exception among the colliers.In spite of their prudery, the neighbour women liked him; he was big, naive, and very courteous with them; he was so, even to his second wife."
"他人高马大，力气又足，十分健硕，在煤矿上工作，赚的钱挺多。他生性谦恭有礼，这使得他免受仇敌困扰，而且他对生活兴致勃勃，有他在的场合总让人感到愉快。就这样，他按自己的方式生活，一直有很多朋友，一直在矿上做着那份不错的工作。","Being a large man of considerable strength and perfect health, he earned good money in the pit.His natural courtesy saved him from enemies, while his fresh interest in life made his presence always agreeable.So he went his own way, had always plenty of friends, always a good job down pit."
"每周他给妻子三十五先令。他家里有两个成年的儿子，他给他们每人每周十二先令。第二次婚姻只有一个孩子，所以雷德福认为妻子做得很好。","He gave his wife thirty-five shillings a week.He had two grown-up sons at home, and they paid twelve shillings each.There was only one child by the second marriage, so Radford considered his wife did well."
"十八个月前，布赖恩和温特沃思手下的工人们进行了一次长达十一周的罢工。那段时间，雷德福夫人对丈夫又是哄又是求，又唠叨，但就是不能从丈夫那里拿到那十先令的罢工津贴。所以当第二次罢工来临的时候，她已准备好要行动起来。","Eighteen months ago, Bryan and Wentworth’s men were out on strike for eleven weeks.During that time, Mrs. Radford could neither cajole nor entreat nor nag the ten shillings strike-pay from her husband.So that when the second strike came on, she was prepared for action."
"雷德福会尽量不引人注目地溜到金号角酒吧的老板娘那儿去。她个子大，平易近人，有四十岁了，而她的丈夫六十三岁，而且还因患风湿病成了瘸子。她坐在路边酒吧的雅座里，一边拼命织衣服，一边用一只中等大小的酒杯啜饮威士忌。当体面的男人来到三英尺宽的吧台前时，她便站起身来招待他、审视他，如果她喜欢他的外表，她会说：","Radford was going, quite inconspicuously, to the publican’s wife at the “Golden Horn”.She is a large, easy-going lady of forty, and her husband is sixty-three, moreover crippled with rheumatism.She sits in the little bar-parlour of the wayside public-house, knitting for dear life, and sipping a very moderate glass of Scotch.When a decent man arrives at the three-foot width of bar, she rises, serves him, surveys him over, and, if she likes his looks, says:"
"“先生不打算进来坐会儿吗？”","“Won’t you step inside, sir?”"
"如果他走进酒吧，会发现里面顶多也就一两个男人。房子很小，暖融融的。老板娘织着衣服。她同生人客套几句，然后继续和她最感兴趣的男人交谈。她为人直率，面颊很红润，棕色的眼睛里透着冷漠。","If he steps inside, he will find not more than one or two men present.The room is warm, quite small.The landlady knits.She gives a few polite words to the stranger, then resumes her conversation with the man who interests her most.She is straight, highly-coloured, with indifferent brown eyes."
"“雷德福先生，您刚刚问我什么？”","“What was that you asked me, Mr. Radford?”"
"“驴尾巴和彩虹有什么不同之处？”雷德福问道，他对谜语有种莫大的热情。","“What is the difference between a donkey’s tail and a rainbow?” asked Radford, who had a consuming passion for conundrums."
"“区别可大了。”老板娘回答说。","“All the difference in the world,” replied the landlady."
"“是这样，可究竟有什么特殊差异？”","“Yes, but what special difference?”"
"“我不得不再次放弃。恐怕你会觉得我很笨。”","“I s ’ll have to give it up again.You’ll think me a donkey’s head, I’m afraid.”"
"“才不会呢。但你现在想想看，哪……”","“Not likely.But just you consider now, wheer...”"
"猜谜还在进行，这时一个女孩走了进来。她皮肤黝黑，长得很迷人。她走出去后，老板娘问道：“你认得她是谁吗？”","The conundrum was still under weigh, when a girl entered.She was swarthy, a fine animal.After she had gone out, “Do you know who that is?” asked the landlady."
"“我不能说得好像我认识她似的。”雷德福回答说，","“I can’t say as I do,” replied Radford."
"“她是弗雷德里克·平诺克的女儿，来自斯托尼·福特。她在追求咱们的威利。”","“She’s Frederick Pinnock’s daughter, from Stony Ford.She’s courting our Willy.”"
"“也是个漂亮的姑娘。”","“And a fine lass, too.”"
"“就目前而言，是够漂亮的。你觉得她会给他当一个怎么样的妻子？”","“Yes, fine enough, as far as that goes.What sort of a wife’ll she make him, think you?”"
"“你让我稍微想一想。”这个男人说道。他掏出笔记本和一支铅笔。老板娘继续和其他客人交谈。","“You just let me consider a bit,” said the man.He took out a pocket-book and a pencil.The landlady continued to talk to the other guests."
"雷德福是个大块头，黑头发，棕色的八字须，有一双暗蓝色眼睛。他的嗓音生来低沉，而且有种奇特的男高音音质，有些沙哑，令人烦躁。他说话时总是调整音调，就像总和女人说话的男人们那样。他的举止中总是透着一种懒散的感觉。","Radford was a big fellow, black-haired, with a brown moustache, and darkish blue eyes.His voice, naturally deep, was pitched in his throat, and had a peculiar, tenor quality, rather husky, and disturbing.He modulated it a good deal as he spoke, as men do who talk much with women.Always, there was a certain indolence in his carriage."
"“我家当家的很懒。”他妻子说，“家里很多活需要做，但你倒是试试看能不能叫动他。”","“Our mester’s lazy,” his wife said.“There’s many a bit of a jab wants doin’, but get him to do it if you can.”"
"但是她知道他只是对一些琐碎的小事不感兴趣而已，并非懒散。","But she knew he was merely indifferent to the little jobs, and not lazy."
"他坐下来写东西，写了十来分钟，最后他念道：","He sat writing for about ten minutes, at the end of which time, he read:"
"“我看到一个美丽的少女，充满活力。","“I see a fine girl full of life."
"我看到她已准备好要过结婚生活。","I see her just ready for wedlock,"
"然而她的眉宇间透着妒意。","But there’s jealousy between her eyebrows."
"嘴角也露出一丝嫉妒。","And jealousy on her mouth."
"我看见前路的烦恼。","I see trouble ahead."
"威利生得孱弱。","Willy is delicate."
"她会帮不上他什么忙。","She would do him no good."
"她永远不会看到他什么时候过得不好。","She would never see when he wasn’t well."
"她只会看到自己的需求——”","She would only see what she wanted—”"
"这样，他用一系列短句记下了自己的想法。他必须摸索着寻找表达方法，这样，任何他想说的比较严肃的话，他就写在自己所谓的“诗”里。","So, in phrases, he got down his thoughts.He had to fumble for expression, and therefore anything serious he wanted to say he wrote in “poetry”, as he called it."
"不久，老板娘站起来说：","Presently, the landlady rose, saying:"
"“我得回去照看我们家当家的了。打烊之前我会再回来。”","“Well, I s’ll have to be looking after our mester.I s’ll be in again before we close.”"
"雷德福继续舒舒服服地坐在那里。过了一会，他也和大家说晚安了。","Radford sat quite comfortably on.In a while, he too bade the company good-night."
"他回到家已是十一点一刻了，儿子们都睡觉了，妻子坐着等他。她是个中等身高的女人，身材圆润，皮肤光滑，就像面团一样矮胖。她的黑头发分得很整齐，狭长的眼睛里透着狡黠和讽刺。她含糊的嗓音里夹杂了一种特有的鼻音。","When he got home, at a quarter past eleven, his sons were in bed, and his wife sat awaiting him.She was a woman of medium height, fat and sleek, a dumpling.Her black hair was parted smooth, her narrow-opened eyes were sly and satirical, she had a peculiar twang in her rather slurring voice."
"“我们家太太是个风骚的女人。”他毫不费力地这样说她。她那极其光滑而富有光泽的脸非常引人注目。她非常健康。","“Our missis is a puss-puss,” he said easily, of her.Her extraordinarily smooth, sleek face was remarkable.She was very healthy."
"他从未醉醺醺地回家。他脱下外套，摘了帽子，穿着衬衫坐下来吃晚饭。尽管他有这样那样的举动，他还是令她着迷。他颈部强健，长着一头卷曲的长发。她要生气就让她生气吧，但她依然爱他的脖颈，特别是当她看到皮肤下突出的青筋时。","He never came in drunk.Having taken off his coat and his cap, he sat down to supper in his shirt-sleeves.Do as he might, she was fascinated by him.He had a strong neck, with the crisp hair growing low.Let her be angry as she would yet she had a passion for that neck of his, particularly when she saw the great vein rib under the skin."
"“太太，”他说道，“我不想吃这肉，我更想来点奶酪。”","“I think, missis,” he said, “I’d rather ha’e a smite o’ cheese than this meat.”"
"“哦，难道你不能自己去取吗？”","“Well, can’t you get it yourself?”"
"“啊，当然能了。”他回答，并走向食品储藏室。","“Yi, surely I can,” he said, and went out to the pantry."
"“我想如果你这么晚才回来，你可以自己服侍自己。”她为自己开脱。","“I think, if yer comin’ in at this time of night, you can wait on yourself,” she justified herself."
"她坐在椅子上，不安地晃动着。他端过来一个盘子，里面除了奶酪，还有一些果酱馅饼。","She moved uneasily in her chair.There were several jam-tarts alongside the cheese on the dish he brought."
"“呃，太太，厨房的垫子坏了。”他说道。","“Yi, Missis, them tan-tafflins’ll go down very nicely,” he said."
"“噢，是吗！既然这样你最好帮帮忙，掏钱修理一下。”她语气温和但很坚定地说道。","“Oh, will they!Then you’d better help to pay for them,” she said, amiably, but determined."
"“你想干什么？”","“Now what art after?”"
"“我想干什么？怎么，你就不能想想看吗？”她语带讽刺地说。","“What am I after?Why, can’t you think?” she said sarcastically."
"“太太，我想东西这方面不行。”","“I’m not for thinkin’, missis.”"
"“是的，我知道你不擅长。但是给我的钱在哪儿呢？你今天从工会那里拿到钱了。我从哪里拿钱呢？”","“No, I know you’re not.But wheer’s my money?You’ve been paid the Union today.Wheer do I come in?”"
"“你有钱啊，你可以用那笔钱。”","“Tha’s got money, an’ tha mun use it.”"
"“谢谢你啦。那你又是没有钱啦？”","“Thank yer.An’ ‘aven’t you none, as well?”"
"“我没钱，半个子儿也没有，除非我们领了工资。”","“I hadna, not till we was paid, not a ha’p’ny.”"
"“那你该为自己所说的感到惭愧。”","“Then you ought to be ashamed of yourself to say so.”"
"“事情就是这样。”","“Appen so.”"
"“工会发的钱我们应该共享。”她说，“只有这么做才是正确的。”","“We’ll go shares wi’ th’ Union money,” she said.“That’s nothing but what’s right.”"
"“我们不会这么做。你有很多钱可以用啊。”","“We shonna.Tha’s got plenty o’ money as tha can use.”"
"“噢，好吧，”她说道，“我会用的。”","“Oh, all right,” she said.“I will do.”"
"她上床休息去了。她没能说动他，这让她感到焦躁。","She went to bed.It made her feel sharp that she could not get at him."
"第二天，她和平日没什么两样。但到了十一点钟，她带上钱包去了城里。街上生意很冷清。人们一帮一帮地闲站着，街上到处是玩弹珠的人。这天早上天气晴朗。雷德福夫人来到一家家具装潢店。","The next day, she was just as usual.But at eleven o’clock she took her purse and went up town.Trade was very slack.Men stood about in gangs, men were playing marbles everywhere in the streets.It was a sunny morning.Mrs. Radford went into the furnisher-and-upholsterer’s shop."
"“有几样东西，”她对奥尔科克先生说，“我打算买回家，我也许现在就该买下来，正好男人们在家，能帮我搬运家具。”","“There’s a few things,” she said to Mr. Allcock, “as I’m wantin’ for the house, and I might as well get them now, while the men’s at home, and can shift me the furniture.”"
"咔哒一声，她把鼓鼓的钱包放在了柜台上。应该让奥尔科克知道，她不是想要“记在账上”。她为厨房买了油地毡，还买了一台新的绞拧机，一套早餐餐具，一个弹簧床垫，还有些其他东西，只剩下了三十先令。她将它们包在手绢一角，打好结。钱包里只有些零钱了。","She put her fat purse on to the counter with a click.The man should know she was not wanting “strap”.She bought linoleum for the kitchen, a new wringer, a breakfast-service, a spring mattress, and various other things, keeping a mere thirty shillings, which she tied in a corner of her handkerchief.In her purse was some loose silver."
"她回家时，她的丈夫正在漫不经心地干着花园里的活。水仙开花了。花园那边的田野里，几匹马驹正仰起它们柔软的棕色的脖子。","Her husband was gardening in a desultory fashion when she got back home.The daffodils were out.The colts in the field at the end of the garden were tossing their velvety brown necks."
"“太太，坐这里吧。”雷德福从小径中间的棚子里招呼道。两只鸽子在笼子里咕咕地叫着。","“Sithee here, missis,” called Radford, from the shed which stood halfway down the path.Two doves in a cage were cooing."
"“你手里是什么？”女人走近他问道。他把满是泥土的大手伸向她，手里是只乌龟。这只爬行动物非常缓慢地再次探出头来取暖。","“What have you got?” asked the woman, as she approached.He held out to her in his big, earthy hand a tortoise.The reptile was very, very slowly issuing its head again to the warmth."
"“他醒得太早了。”雷德福说道。","“He’s wakkened up betimes,” said Radford."
"“他跟你们男人一样，醒来就是为了休假。”他妻子说。雷德福搔了一下那小家伙满是鳞片的脑袋。","“He’s like th’ men, wakened up for a holiday,” said the wife.Radford scratched the little beast’s scaly head."
"“看到他出来，我挺开心的。”他说。","“We pleased to see him out,” he said."
"他们刚刚吃过晚饭，就有人来敲门。","They had just finished dinner, when a man knocked at the door."
"“我是从奥尔科克家具装潢店过来的！”那人说道。","“From Allcock’s!” he said."
"这个丰腴的女人接过装着她买的陶器的盛衣筐。","The plump woman took up the clothes-basket containing the crockery she had bought."
"“那里面是些什么？”她丈夫问道。","“Whativer hast got theer?” asked her husband."
"“我们老早就需要早餐杯具了，因此我今早去城里买了回来。”她回答说。","“We’ve been wantin’ some breakfast-cups for ages, so I went up town an’ got ‘em this mornin’,” she replied."
"他看着她把陶器取出来。","He watched her taking out the crockery."
"“嗯！”他说，“看上去你已经开始花钱了。”","“Hm!” he said.“Tha’s been on th’ spend, seemly.”"
"又有砰砰的敲门声。来人放下一卷油地毡。雷德福先生过去看了一下。","Again there was a thud at the door.The man had put down a roll of linoleum.Mr. Radford went to look at it."
"“东西滚滚而至啊！”他叫道。","“They come rolling in!” he exclaimed."
"“关于厨房的破油地毡，还有谁比你抱怨得多？”他的妻子用她那狡猾的、猫一样的嗓音说道。","“Who’s grumbled more than you about the raggy oilcloth of this kitchen?” said the insidious, cat-like voice of the wife."
"“好吧，好吧。”雷德福说。","“It’s all right, it’s all right,” said Radford."
"车夫拿着另外一卷进门来，放下这卷时他咕哝了一下。","The carter came up the entry with another roll, which he deposited with a grunt at the door."
"“你估算一下这批东西要多少钱？”他问。","“An’ how much do you reckon this lot is?” he asked."
"“哦，这些都付过钱了，别担心。”妻子回答说。","“Oh, they’re all paid for, don’t worry,” replied the wife."
"“先生，您能帮我一把吗？”车夫问道。","“Shall yer gi’e me a hand, mester?” asked the carter."
"雷德福跟着他出了门，还是他那种随意懒散的状态。他的妻子也跟了出来。他的马甲松松地披在衬衫外面。她跟着他，看他健康的身体和灵巧的动作，便暗自发笑。","Radford followed him down the entry, in his easy, slouching way.His wife went after.His waistcoat was hanging loose over his shirt.She watched his easy movement of well-being as she followed him, and she laughed to herself."
"车夫抓住钢丝床垫的一端，把床垫往前拖出来。","The carter took hold of one end of the wire mattress, dragged it forth."
"“哦，这是个大家伙！”雷德福接过这重担，说道。","“Well, this is a corker!” said Radford, as he received the burden."
"“现在轮到绞扭机了！”车夫说。","“Now the mangle!” said the carter."
"“太太，你在盘算什么呢？”丈夫问道。","“What dost reckon tha’s been up to, missis?” asked the husband."
"“上回洗衣服时我对自己说过，我要是还得用那台旧的绞拧机，你就自己洗自己的衣服吧。”","“I said to myself last wash-day, if I had to turn that mangle again, tha’d ha’e ter wash the clothes thyself.”"
"雷德福再次跟着车夫出了门。街上女人们观望着，几十个男人在车周围闲逛。一个爱管闲事的人帮忙搬了绞拧机。","Radford followed the carter down the entry again.In the street, women were standing watching, and dozens of men were lounging round the cart.One officiously helped with the wringer."
"“给他三便士。”雷德福夫人说。","“Gi’e him thrippence,” said Mrs. Radford."
"“你给吧。”她丈夫回答说。","“Gi’e him thysen,” replied her husband."
"“我没有少于一个克朗的零钱。”","“I’ve no change under half a crown.”"
"雷德福给了车夫小费，然后回到家里。他审视着挤在屋子和院子里的这些陶器、油地毡、床垫、轧布机以及其他一些东西。","Radford tipped the carter, and returned indoors.He surveyed the array of crockery, linoleum, mattress, mangle, and other goods crowding the house and the yard."
"“哇，这真让人目不暇接啊！”他重复道。","“Well, this is a winder!” he repeated."
"“我们很需要它们啊。”她回答说。","“We stood in need of ‘em enough,” she replied."
"“我希望你还有钱从店里买到更多东西。”他回答说，口气让人不安。","“I hope tha’s got plenty more from wheer they came from,” he replied dangerously."
"“这正是我没有的。”她把钱包打开来。“还有两张半个克朗的钱，这就是我所有的钱了。”","“That’s just what I haven’t.”She opened her purse.“Two half-crowns, that’s every copper I’ve got i’ th’ world.”"
"他看着钱包，一动也不动。","He stood very still as he looked."
"“这没错。”她说。","“It’s right,” she said."
"她觉得满意，还有点沾沾自喜。他感到一阵愤怒攫住了他，让他失去了理智。但是他等了又等。突然间，他举起胳膊，握紧拳头，对她怒目而视。她缩了回去，吓得脸色苍白。但是他收起拳头，转身走了出去，嘴里还嘀咕着。他向花园中间的棚子走过去。在那里他拿起那只乌龟，垂着头站着，抚摸着它那坚硬的脑袋。","There was a certain smug sense of satisfaction about her.A wave of anger came over him, blinding him.But he waited and waited.Suddenly his arm leapt up, the fist clenched, and his eyes blazed at her.She shrank away, pale and frightened.But he dropped his fist to his side, turned, and went out, muttering.He went down to the shed that stood in the middle of the garden.There he picked up the tortoise, and stood with bent head, rubbing its horny head."
"她迟疑地站在那里，看着他。她的心很沉重，但是眼里却露出一种古怪的、像猫一样的满足神情。然后她走进屋，用一种赞赏的目光凝视她的新杯具。","She stood hesitating, watching him.Her heart was heavy, and yet there was a curious, cat-like look of satisfaction round her eyes.Then she went indoors and gazed at her new cups, admiringly."
"接下来的一周，他把半沙弗林的钱交给她，没有说一个字。","The next week he handed her his half-sovereign without a word."
"“你自己需要一些吧。”她说道，并给了他一先令。他收下了钱。","“You’ll want some for yourself,” she said, and she gave him a shilling.He accepted it."
