"神秘画像的奇遇","The Adventure of the Mysterious Picture"
"作者：华盛顿·欧文","by Washington Irving"
"这类故事，讲了一个就带出另一个，大伙都沉浸在其中，打算把自己的亲戚祖先请出场。如果不是一个一直在呼呼大睡、又老又胖的猎狐人突然醒来，打了一个又长又响的哈欠，不知道我们还要听多少这样惊险的鬼故事。这个声响破坏了气氛，就像一声鸡鸣，把鬼怪们都吓跑了。而大伙也都纷纷起身准备去睡觉。","As one story of the kind produces another, and as all the company seemed fully engrossed by the topic, and disposed to bring their relatives and ancestors upon the scene, there is no knowing how many more ghost adventures we might have heard, had not a corpulent old fox-hunter, who had slept soundly through the whole, now suddenly awakened, with a loud and long-drawn yawn.The sound broke the charm; the ghosts took to flight as though it had been cock-crowing, and there was a universal move for bed."
"“现在去闹鬼的房间吧。”爱尔兰上尉拿着蜡烛说。","“And now for the haunted chamber,” said the Irish captain, taking his candle."
"“是啊，今晚谁会是主角呢？”一位面色颓废的先生问道。","“Aye, who’s to be the hero of the night?” said the gentleman with the ruined head."
"“明天早晨我们就知道了，”老先生用鼻音哼着说，“谁脸色灰白，谁就见到鬼了。”","“That we shall see in the morning,” said the old gentleman with the nose: “whoever looks pale and grizzly will have seen the ghost.”"
"“唉，先生们，”准男爵说，“玩笑中倒有不少真话。实际上，你们中总有一位今晚会睡在那个房间——”","“Well, gentlemen,” said the Baronet, “there’s many a true thing said in jest.In fact, one of you will sleep in a room to-night—”"
"“什么——闹鬼的房间？闹鬼的房间？我要求去冒这个险——还有我——还有我——还有我！”十几个客人们呼喊着，边说边笑。","“What—a haunted room? a haunted room?I claim the adventure—and I—and I—and I,” cried a dozen guests, talking and laughing at the same time."
"“不——不，”主人说，“有一个房间确实有个秘密，而且我打算在那个房间做个实验。所以，先生们，你们谁也不会知道是谁住在闹鬼的房间，到时候自然就会知道。连我都不会知道，就让管家随机分配吧。同时，如果先生们乐意听，为了祖宅的荣誉，我想再说一句，这里没有一个房间不值得鬼怪出没。”","“No—no,” said mine host, “there is a secret about one of my rooms on which I feel disposed to try an experiment.So, gentlemen, none of you shall know who has the haunted chamber, until circumstances reveal it.I will not even know it myself, but will leave it to chance and the allotment of the housekeeper.At the same time, if it will be any satisfaction to you, I will observe, for the honor of my paternal mansion, that there’s scarcely a chamber in it but is well worthy of being haunted.”"
"说到这我们就解散了，各自去分到的房间睡觉。我分到的是一间厢房，它的风格和晚饭时讲到的故事中描述的那种出事的房间非常相似，我不禁一笑。房间宽大阴暗，装饰着已经被油灯熏黑了的画像，床上铺着古老样式的锦缎，上面耸立着一个足以供皇家使用的华盖，还有许多老式的、又大又沉的家具。我将一把爪形底的大扶手椅拉到宽大的壁炉前，把火拨旺了，坐下望着炉火，想着我听到的几个怪异故事，就这样想着想着，一半由于白天打猎很疲倦，一半由于主人款待的葡萄酒和酒宴，我在椅子里睡着了。","We now separated for the night, and each went to his allotted room.Mine was in one wing of the building, and I could not but smile at its resemblance in style to those eventful apartments described in the tales of the supper table.It was spacious and gloomy, decorated with lamp-black portraits, a bed of ancient damask, with a tester sufficiently lofty to grace a couch of state, and a number of massive pieces of old-fashioned furniture.I drew a great claw-footed arm-chair before the wide fire-place; stirred up the fire; sat looking into it, and musing upon the odd stories I had heard; until, partly overcome by the fatigue of the day’s hunting, and partly by the wine and wassail of mine host, I fell asleep in my chair."
"睡觉的姿势很不舒服，让我睡得很不好，还做了各种各样狂乱恐怖的梦。这时难以消化的晚餐又作起怪来，搅得我不得安宁。我感觉一块肥大的羊肉折磨着我，一块葡萄干布丁像铅一般压在我的心头，过去想想就令我开心的阉鸡，现在却引起我种种可怕的联想，还有一只辣火鸡腿迈开大步，做出各种恶魔鬼怪的样子。总而言之，我做了许多恶梦。似乎有种奇怪的、不确定的邪恶力量笼罩在我周围，让我无法逃避；某种恐怖又可恶的东西压抑着我，让我无法摆脱。我知道自己在睡觉，挣扎着让自己醒来，但每一次努力都让恶势力加倍袭来，直到我一面喘气，一面挣扎，几乎窒息时，猛然从椅子上笔直地弹起，我这才清醒过来。","The uneasiness of my position made my slumber troubled, and laid me at the mercy of all kinds of wild and fearful dreams; now it was that my perfidious dinner and supper rose in rebellion against my peace.I was hag-ridden by a fat saddle of mutton; a plum pudding weighed like lead upon my conscience; the merry thought of a capon filled me with horrible suggestions; and a devilled leg of a turkey stalked in all kinds of diabolical shapes through my imagination.In short, I had a violent fit of the nightmare.Some strange indefinite evil seemed hanging over me that I could not avert; something terrible and loathsome oppressed me that I could not shake off.I was conscious of being asleep, and strove to rouse myself, but every effort redoubled the evil; until gasping, struggling, almost strangling, I suddenly sprang bolt upright in my chair, and awoke."
"此时壁炉架上的蜡烛已快燃尽，灯芯也分叉了。在朝向我的这边，蜡烛流下很大一滩融化的蜡。那支烧偏了的细蜡烛，发出一大团闪耀的火焰，强光照亮了壁炉上方的一幅画，一幅我迄今还没注意到的画。","The light on the mantel-piece had burnt low, and the wick was divided; there was a great winding sheet made by the dripping wax, on the side towards me.The disordered taper emitted a broad flaring flame, and threw a strong light on a painting over the fire-place, which I had not hitherto observed."
"画里只有一个头，更准确地说是一张脸，仿佛在直直地盯着我，表情很是惊人。画像没有边框，乍一看，我简直以为是一张真脸从漆黑的橡木板里探了出来。我坐在椅子上盯着这幅画，越看越让我心里不安。从没有一幅画能让我反应如此强烈。因为它，我的情绪变得奇怪，难以名状。那双眼睛有几分像我听说过的可归为蛇怪之眼的东西，或像是有着爬行动物所具有的称作魅惑的神秘力量。我用一只手在眼前挥了几下，似乎本能地想要拂去眼前的幻象——可是没用——我的目光马上又回到画上，而那侵袭着我全身的、令人恐惧、缓缓渗透的力量更是增倍了。","It consisted merely of a head, or rather a face, that appeared to be staring full upon me, and with an expression that was startling.It was without a frame, and at the first glance I could hardly persuade myself that it was not a real face, thrusting itself out of the dark oaken pannel.I sat in my chair gazing at it, and the more I gazed the more it disquieted me.I had never before been affected in the same way by any painting.The emotions it caused were strange and indefinite.They were something like what I have heard ascribed to the eyes of the basilisk; or like that mysterious influence in reptiles termed fascination.I passed my hand over my eyes several times, as if seeking instinctively to brush away this allusion—in vain—they instantly reverted to the picture, and its chilling, creeping influence over my flesh was redoubled."
"我环顾屋内其他的画，想转移注意力，或想看看其他画像会不会产生同样的效果。有几幅也够恐怖的，如果单是画得恐怖就能产生那种效果——然而并非如此。我的眼光扫过所有的画都毫无感觉，但当目光一回到壁炉上方的那张脸，我就感觉像电击穿过全身一般。其他的画都已经模糊褪色，唯有这幅，从纯黑的背景中突出来，立体感非常强，色彩逼真。那表情极度痛苦——那种因身体剧痛而造成的痛苦。但那眉头紧锁的凶相和点点血滴，使得画像看上去更加恐怖。但那个表情的特点还不止于此——这幅画能激起人情绪上的恐慌，和某种不可思议的厌恶感，这让我苦恼不已。","I looked around the room on other pictures, either to divert my attention, or to see whether the same effect would be produced by them.Some of them were grim enough to produce the effect, if the mere grimness of the painting produced it—no such thing.My eye passed over them all with perfect indifference, but the moment it reverted to this visage over the fire-place, it was as if an electric shock darted through me.The other pictures were dim and faded; but this one protruded from a plain black ground in the strongest relief, and with wonderful truth of coloring.The expression was that of agony—the agony of intense bodily pain; but a menace scowled upon the brow, and a few sprinklings of blood added to its ghastliness.Yet it was not all these characteristics—it was some horror of the mind, some inscrutable antipathy awakened by this picture, which harrowed up my feelings."
"我极力让自己相信这是幻想，是我在主人盛宴上的头脑发热，再多少加上晚饭桌上那些关于画的古怪故事，把脑袋给弄糊涂了。我决定甩开这些脑中的幻想，我从椅子上站起来，在房间里来回走，打响指，振作精神，还大声笑出来。笑声很勉强，在老屋子里回响，很是刺耳。我走向窗口，试图辨清窗玻璃外的景色。窗外漆黑一片，狂风暴雨大作。就在我听到风在树木间呼啸时，突然看到窗玻璃上映出了那张吓人的脸，似乎透过窗户在瞪着我。连那影子也令人毛骨悚然。","I tried to persuade myself that this was chimerical; that my brain was confused by the fumes of mine host’s good cheer, and, in some measure, by the odd stories about paintings which had been told at supper.I determined to shake off these vapors of the mind; rose from my chair, and walked about the room; snapped my fingers; rallied myself; laughed aloud.It was a forced laugh, and the echo of it in the old chamber jarred upon my ear.I walked to the window; tried to discern the landscape through the glass.It was pitch darkness, and howling storm without; and as I heard the wind moan among the trees, I caught a reflection of this accursed visage in the pane of glass, as though it were staring through the window at me.Even the reflection of it was thrilling."
"我安慰自己说这只是讨厌的神经紧张，可是要怎么克服呢？我决定强迫自己不看那幅画，迅速脱衣服上床。我开始脱衣服，但是不管怎么努力也忍不住时不时偷瞄那幅画一眼，而现在只看一眼就够我受的了。即使我背朝画像，但我一想到那张怪异的脸就在身后盯着自己看，就难以忍受。我扔开衣服，急忙上床，但是那张脸还是盯着我。我在床上还是能够看到整张脸，而且我好一会儿都没法从那脸上移开目光。我已经紧张到了可怕的程度。","How was this vile nervous fit, for such I now persuaded myself it was, to be conquered?I determined to force myself not to look at the painting but to undress quickly and get into bed.I began to undress, but in spite of every effort I could not keep myself from stealing a glance every now and then at the picture; and a glance was now sufficient to distress me.Even when my back was turned to it, the idea of this strange face behind me, peering over my shoulder, was insufferable.I threw off my clothes and hurried into bed; but still this visage gazed upon me.I had a full view of it from my bed, and for some time could not take my eyes from it.I had grown nervous to a dismal degree."
"我熄了灯，试着强迫自己睡觉——但是完全没用！炉火旺了一点，在屋子里照出闪烁不定的光亮，但挂那幅画的地方仍然是一片阴影。我想，倘若这就是主人说的神秘房间，我该如何是好？——我当时可把他的话只当玩笑话了，难道他说的是真的吗？我环顾四周。昏暗的光线下，这间屋子具有闹鬼房间必要的所有条件。由于我的想象受了影响，房间开始出现奇怪的幻象。旧画像越来越浅，然后越来越黑；那些古雅的旧家具映着明暗相间的光影，看上去造型非凡，很有特色。一个古式衣橱开始渐渐让我感到压抑，它又大又黑，镶着黄铜，打了蜡，华丽而有光泽。","I put out the light, and tried to force myself to sleep;—all in vain!The fire gleaming up a little, threw an uncertain light about the room, leaving, however, the region of the picture in deep shadow.What, thought I, if this be the chamber about which mine host spoke as having a mystery reigning over it?—I had taken his words merely as spoken in jest; might they have a real import?I looked around.The faintly lighted apartment had all the qualifications requisite for a haunted chamber.It began in my infected imagination to assume strange appearances.The old portraits turned paler and paler, and blacker and blacker; the streaks of light and shadow thrown among the quaint old articles of furniture, gave them singular shapes and characters.There was a huge dark clothes-press of antique form, gorgeous in brass and lustrous with wax, that began to grow oppressive to me."
"“那我，”我想，“就是闹鬼房间的主角了吗？我是真的被施咒语了，还是这全是主人想出的法子，想戏弄我来引人一笑呢？”一想到我整夜地自己吓自己，到了第二天还会因为憔悴的面孔而被嘲笑，我就受不了，但仅仅这样一想就够我受的了，我变得更加焦虑不安。“呸！”我说，“不会有这种事。我的主人怎么会想得到我，或者任何一个人，会为区区一幅画苦恼到这个地步呢？是我自己病态的想象折磨自己罢了。”我躺在床上，翻来覆去地试着入睡，可就是不行。一个人要是安静地躺着都睡不着，那翻来覆去也是无济于事。炉火渐渐熄灭，房间只剩下一片黑暗。我仍然想着那张莫名其妙的脸在黑暗中注视着我，一直望着我。而且更糟糕的是，黑暗似乎给予了它额外的力量，使其恐怖感加倍。就像一个看不见的敌人在黑夜里徘徊在你周围。现在折磨我的不是一幅画，而是一百幅。我幻想它出现在四面八方——“它在这里，”我想，“还有那里！还有这里！它仍然在用那恐怖神秘的表情紧紧地盯着我。不行——如果我必须经受这种奇怪又可怕的折磨，我宁愿面对的是一个纯粹的敌人，而不是敌人的一千个影像。”","“Am I then, ” thought I, “ indeed, the hero of the haunted room?Is there really a spell laid upon me, or is this all some contrivance of mine host, to raise a laugh at my expense?”The idea of being hagridden by my own fancy all night, and then bantered on my haggard looks the next day was intolerable; but the very idea was sufficient to produce the effect, and to render me still more nervous.“Pish,” said I, “it can be no such thing.How could my  host imagine that I, or any man would be so worried by a mere picture?It is my own diseased imagination that torments me.”I turned in my bed, and shifted from side to side, to try to fall asleep; but all in vain.When one cannot get asleep by lying quiet, it is seldom that tossing about will effect the purpose.The fire gradually went out and left the room in darkness.Still I had the idea of this inexplicable countenance gazing and keeping watch upon me through the darkness.Nay, what was worse, the very darkness seemed to give it additional power, and to multiply its terrors.It was like having an unseen enemy hovering about one in the night.Instead of having one picture now to worry me, I had a hundred.I fancied it in every direction—“And there it is,” thought I, “and there! and there! with its horrible and mysterious expression, still gazing and gazing on me.No—if I must suffer this strange and dismal influence, it were better face a single foe, than thus be haunted by a thousand images of it.”"
"任何经历过紧张焦虑状态的人一定知道，时间持续得越长，情形越难以控制。最后，屋子里的空气似乎也被这幅邪恶的画像所传染了。我想象那幅画就悬停在我的上方。我几乎感到墙上那张恐怖的脸在朝我逼近——似乎在对着我吐气。“受不了了，”我说，最终跳下了床。“我再也受不了了。我要是整夜只会在床上乱翻乱滚，把自己也弄成个鬼怪，那会当真成为闹鬼房间的主角了。不管结果会怎样，我要离开这个受诅咒的房间，另外找个地方睡觉。无论怎样，他们也就笑笑而已，要是我整夜不睡，第二天早上让他们看到憔悴哀怨的面孔，他们绝对会取笑我的。”","Whoever has been in such a state of nervous agitation must know that the longer it continues, the more uncontrollable it grows; the very air of the chamber seemed at length infected by the baleful presence of this picture.I fancied it hovering over me.I almost felt the fearful visage from the wall approaching my face,—it seemed breathing upon me.“This is not to be borne,” said I, at length, springing out of bed.“I can stand this no longer.I shall only tumble and toss about here all night; make a very spectre of myself, and become the hero of the haunted chamber in good earnest.Whatever be the consequence, I’ll quit this cursed room, and seek a night’s rest elsewhere.They can but laugh at me at all events, and they’ll be sure to have the laugh upon me if I pass a sleepless night and show them a haggard and wo-begone visage in the morning.”"
"我一边喃喃自语，一边匆忙套上衣服。穿好后，我摸着黑离开房间，下楼到了客厅。在我被两三个家具绊倒之后，终于摸到一个沙发，伸展四肢往上一躺，打定主意，今晚就在那里睡了。","All this was half muttered to myself, as I hastily slipped on my clothes; which having done, I groped my way out of the room, and down-stairs to the drawing-room.Here, after tumbling over two or three pieces of furniture, I made out to reach a sofa, and stretching myself upon it determined to bivouac there for the night."
"我发觉自己一离开那幅诡异的画，它的魔力似乎就消失了。它的一切影响也终结了。我确信它被关在了那间属于它的阴郁房间里，因为我出于一种本能的谨慎，在关门时把门锁上了。因此我很快就平静下来，进入了安静的状态，继而昏昏欲睡，终于睡熟了。直到女佣拿着扫帚，哼着晨曲，收拾整理房间时，我才醒过来。她发现了睡在沙发上的我，盯着我看。我猜在她单身的主人家中，打过猎吃过饭后出现这样类似的情况也是常有的事，因为她继续哼她的歌，干她的活，不再注意我。","The moment I found myself out of the neighborhood of that strange picture, it seemed as if the charm were broken.All its influence was at an end.I felt assured that it was confined to its own dreary chamber, for I had, with a sort of instinctive caution, turned the key when I closed the door.I soon calmed down, therefore, into a state of tranquillity; from that into a drowsiness, and finally into a deep sleep; out of which I did not awake, until the housemaid, with her besom and her matin song, came to put the room in order.She stared at finding me stretched upon the sofa; but I presume circumstances of the kind were not uncommon after hunting dinners, in her master’s bachelor establishment; for she went on with her song and her work, and took no farther heed of me."
"我对回到房间有一种压抑不住的反感，于是我找到男管家的住处，在条件允许的情况下尽可能地梳洗了一下。我属于最先出现在早餐桌上的那一批。早餐非常丰盛，是一顿给猎狐人的大餐。大家基本上都到齐了。早餐根据客人的不同口味，准备了大量的茶、咖啡、冷肉，还有冒着泡的麦芽酒，等大家吃饱喝足后，就开始聊天了，早晨大家都充满活力，精神饱满，十分愉快。","I had an unconquerable repugnance to return to my chamber; so I found my way to the butler’s quarters, made my toilet in the best way circumstances would permit, and was among the first to appear at the breakfast table.Our breakfast was a substantial fox-hunter’s repast, and the company were generally assembled at it.When ample justice had been done to the tea, coffee, cold meats, and humming ale, for all these were furnished in abundance, according to the tastes of the different guests, the conversation began to break out, with all the liveliness and freshness of morning mirth."
"“到底谁是闹鬼房间的主角？——昨晚谁看到鬼了？”那位好问先生转动着一对龙虾眼，在饭桌周围到处看。","“But who is the hero of the haunted chamber?—Who has seen the ghost last night?” said the inquisitive gentleman, rolling his lobster eyes about the table."
"这个问题一出，人人都说起来了，到处是嬉笑声，都在评论众人的脸色，互相指责和反击。有的人喝多了，有的人胡子没刮，所以席间可疑的脸有的是。只有我没法轻松、快活地和大家一起开玩笑。我觉得舌头打结——窘得很。前一天晚上的所见所感，依旧在我脑子里作祟。","The question set every tongue in motion; a vast deal of bantering; criticising of countenances; of mutual accusation and retort took place.Some had drunk deep, and some were unshaven, so that there were suspicious faces enough in the assembly.I alone could not enter with ease and vivacity into the joke.I felt tongue-tied—embarrassed.A recollection of what I had seen and felt the preceding night still haunted my mind."
"似乎那副神秘画像依旧掌控着我。我也认为主人在用好奇的眼光望着我。简而言之，我意识到我是那晚的主角，并且觉得每个人都可以从我的表情中察觉出来。","It seemed as if the mysterious picture still held a thrall upon me.I thought also that our host’s eye was turned on me with an air of curiosity.In short, I was conscious that I was the hero of the night, and felt as if every one might read it in my looks."
"然而玩笑过去了，大家似乎没怀疑到我身上。我正庆幸逃过这劫时，一个佣人进来说，那位睡在客厅沙发上的客人把表落在枕头下了。我的打簧表正在他手里。","The jokes, however, passed over, and no suspicion seemed to attach to me.I was just congratulating myself on my escape, when a servant came in, saying, that the gentleman who had slept on the sofa in the drawing-room, had left his watch under one of the pillows.My repeater was in his hand."
"“什么！”好问先生说，“有人睡在沙发上？”","“What!” said the inquisitive gentleman, “did any gentleman sleep on the sofa?”"
"“哈哈！哈哈！一只野兔——一只野兔！”那个鼻子灵活的老先生叫起来。","“Soho! soho! a hare—a hare!” cried the old gentleman with the flexible nose."
"我没法不认领那块表，正当我心慌意乱地要站起时，坐在我旁边吵吵嚷嚷的老乡绅拍着我的肩膀喊道：“说实在的，伙计！看到鬼的是你吧！”","I could not avoid acknowledging the watch, and was rising in great confusion, when a boisterous old squire who sat beside me, exclaimed, slapping me on the shoulder, “Sblood, lad! thou’rt the man as has seen the ghost!”"
"大家的注意力立刻集中到了我身上。要是前一刻我的脸色还是苍白的话，现在已经红得发烫了。我强作笑容，却只能作苦相，我发现脸部的全部肌肉在胡乱抽搐，完全不由我控制了。","The attention of the company was immediately turned to me; if my face had been pale the moment before, it now glowed almost to burning.I tried to laugh, but could only make a grimace; and found all the muscles of my face twitching at sixes and sevens, and totally out of all control."
"一群猎狐人聚在一起，一点事就能大笑起来。大家都在拿我当乐子，嬉笑不止。玩笑开到我头上的时候我从来都不喜欢太过火，于是我开始觉得有点恼了。我试着使自己看上去很冷静，控制着自己的火气。但人在被激怒的情况下，就没有那么冷静了。","It takes but little to raise a laugh among a set of fox-hunters.There was a world of merriment and joking at my expense; and as I never relished a joke overmuch when it was at my own expense, I began to feel a little nettled.I tried to look cool and calm and to restrain my pique; but the coolness and calmness of a man in a passion are confounded treacherous."
"“各位，”我微微翘起下巴，强装笑脸，说道，“这很有趣啊——哈！哈！很有趣——但你们要知道，我和在座的所有人一样，都不迷信——哈！哈！说到胆小——各位，你们尽管笑——但我确信在座没有哪一位会有那个意思。至于闹鬼的房间，我再说一遍，各位，（看到周围有人突然龇牙咧嘴地咒骂，我有点火了）那个闹鬼的房间，我和各位一样，一点都不相信这种蠢话。但是，既然你们把话题抛给了我，我要说，我的确在房间里遇到了难以解释的怪事——（一阵哄笑）各位，我是认真的——我很清楚我在说什么——我很冷静，各位（我拍了拍桌子）——老天在上，我真的很冷静。我不开玩笑，也不希望别人拿我开玩笑——（大家止住了笑声，很滑稽地装正经。）昨晚我睡的房间里有一幅画，对我产生了一种非常独特的、无法理解的影响。”","“Gentlemen,” said I, with a slight cocking of the chin, and a bad attempt at a smile, “this is all very pleasant—ha! ha!—very pleasant—but I’d have you know I am as little superstitious as any of you—ha! ha!—and as to anything like timidity—you may smile, gentlemen—but I trust there is no one here means to insinuate that.—As to a room’s being haunted, I repeat, gentlemen—(growing a little warm at seeing a cursed grin breaking out round me)—as to a room’s being haunted, I have as little faith in such silly stories as any one.But, since you put the matter home to me, I will say that I have met with something in my room strange and inexplicable to me—(a shout of laughter).Gentlemen, I am serious—I know well what I am saying—I am calm, gentlemen, (striking my flat upon the table)—by heaven I am calm.I am neither trifling, nor do I wish to be trifled with—(the laughter of the company suppressed with ludicrous attempts at gravity).There is a picture in the room in which I was put last night, that has had an effect upon me the most singular and incomprehensible.”"
"“一幅画！”老先生说道，一头雾水。“一幅画！”那个鼻子长得很有趣的说话者喊道。“一幅画！一幅画！”好几个声音附和道。此时爆发出一阵放肆的哄笑。","“A picture!” said the old gentleman with the haunted head.“A picture!” cried the narrator with the waggish nose.“A picture! a picture!” echoed several voices.Here there was an ungovernable peal of laughter."
"我克制不住自己了。我猛地从座位上跳起来——怒火冲天地望着大家——双手往口袋里一插，径直迈向一扇窗户，就像我要穿过它走出去一样。我突然停下，望向窗外的景色，无心欣赏，只觉得咽喉堵得快要窒息了。","I could not contain myself.I started up from my seat—looked round on the company with fiery indignation—thrust both my hands into my pockets, and strode up to one of the windows, as though I would have walked through it.I stopped short; looked out upon the landscape without distinguishing a feature of it; and felt my gorge rising almost to suffocation."
"我的主人看出是时候出面了。整个过程中，他始终保持着严肃的态度，他现在正迈步向前，好像要保护我免受众人一边倒的嘲笑。","Mine host saw it was time to interfere.He had maintained an air of Gravity through the whole of the scene, and now stepped forth as if to shelter me from the overwhelming merriment of my companions."
"“先生们，”他说，“我不喜欢破坏气氛，但你们也笑够了，大家都从闹鬼房间的笑话中找到了乐子。我现在必须为我的这位客人说几句话。我不仅要为他辩护，不受你们嘲笑，还想劝他别生气了，因为我猜他此刻心里有点不高兴；我尤其要恳求他的原谅，因为我让他成为了我的实验对象。","“Gentlemen,” said he, “I dislike to spoil sport, but you have had your laugh, and the joke of the haunted chamber has been enjoyed.I must now take the part of my guest.I must not only vindicate him from your pleasantries, but I must reconcile him to himself, for I suspect he is a little out of humor with his own feelings; and above all, I must crave his pardon for having made him the subject of a kind of experiment."
"“是的，先生们，昨晚我们这位朋友住的房间的确有些诡异。房间里有一幅拥有非凡神秘力量的画，而且这幅画还跟一个非常奇异的故事有关。由于种种原因，我很珍惜这幅画。任何见到这幅画的人都感觉奇怪和不舒服，这使我总想要毁了它，但我从不能说服自己这样做。我自己从不爱看这幅画，我的所有仆人们也害怕看。所以，我把它丢在一间不常使用的房间里。昨晚我本该把它遮起来的，可是我们谈话的主题和闹鬼房间的怪谈诱惑了我，我要做个实验，让这幅画保持原样，看一个完全不知内情的陌生人会不会受这幅画的影响。”","“Yes, gentlemen, there is something strange and peculiar in the chamber to which our friend was shown last night.There is a picture which possesses a singular and mysterious influence; and with which there is connected a very curious story.It is a picture to which I attach a value from a variety of circumstances; and though I have often been tempted to destroy it from the odd and uncomfortable sensations it produces in every one that beholds it; yet I have never been able to prevail upon myself to make the sacrifice.It is a picture I never like to look upon myself; and which is held in awe by all my servants.I have, therefore, banished it to a room but rarely used; and should have had it covered last night, had not the nature of our conversation, and the whimsical talk about a haunted chamber tempted me to let it remain, by way of experiment, whether a stranger, totally unacquainted with its story, would be affected by it.”"
"准男爵的话把每个人的思绪都引向了另一个话题：所有人都迫不及待地想要听神秘画像的故事。连我自己也产生了浓厚的兴趣，甚至忘了怨恨主人不该拿我做实验来刺激我的神经，我兴致勃勃地跟大家一起，要求准男爵给大家讲故事。","The words of the Baronet had turned every thought into a different channel: all were anxious to hear the story of the mysterious picture; and for myself, so strongly were my feelings interested, that I forgot to feel piqued at the experiment which my host had made upon my nerves, and joined eagerly in the general entreaty."
"那天早晨风雨大作，大家都没法出门，主人很乐意找到任何供客人们消遣的法子。于是他拉了一把扶手椅到炉火边，讲了起来——","As the morning was stormy, and precluded all egress, my host was glad of any means of entertaining his company; so drawing his arm-chair beside the fire, he began—"
