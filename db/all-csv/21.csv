"第一章","CHAPTER 1"
"九品文官雅科夫·彼得罗维奇·戈利亚德金从熟睡中醒来时，已是将近早上八点了。他打了个呵欠，伸了个懒腰，终于完全睁开了睡眼。然而，他又在床上躺了两分钟没动，好像还不十分肯定自己醒了没有，不知道周围发生的一切是真的、实实在在的，还是他仍在做着混乱的梦。不过很快，戈利亚德金先生就逐渐清醒过来了，开始清楚地看到他每天习以为常的那些东西了。小屋那被烟熏得脏兮兮的、满是灰尘的绿色墙壁，红木五斗橱和椅子，上了红漆的桌子，用上面有一些绿色碎花的淡红色美国皮革罩着的沙发，还有前一天晚上匆匆脱掉、扔在沙发上褶成一堆的衣服：这一切都是那么的熟悉。最后还有那个湿气很重的秋日——闷热潮湿又浑浊肮脏——透过昏暗的窗玻璃窥视着屋子，带着如此一副没好气的苦相，以致于戈利亚德金先生再也无法怀疑了：他并不在睡乡而是在彼得堡城，在位于六铺街一座庞大建筑物的第四层的自己的寓所里。戈利亚德金先生做出这一重大发现后，又慌忙闭上了双眼，好像在为自己的美梦而感到痛惜，片刻想要重返旧梦似的。但过了一分钟后，他一下子从被窝里钻出，很可能是突然抓住了一直以来萦绕心头、恍恍惚惚的思绪。从被窝爬出后，他就朝立在五斗橱上的小圆梳妆镜直奔而去。虽然镜子里的那个人面带倦容，有点近视，还是秃顶，是那样的其貌不扬，以致于乍一看没人会特别注意，然而这副面容的主人却对他在镜子里看到的一切深表满意。“事情将会是什么样的呢？”戈利亚德金先生低声说道，“如果我今天稍有疏忽，如果一些东西出了差错，如果出现了一些讨厌的粉刺，或者发生了别的任何不愉快的情况，事情会怎样啊？然而，没什么不对劲儿的，到目前为止，一切都正常。”","It was a little before eight o’clock in the morning when Yakov Petrovitch Golyadkin, a titular councillor, woke up from a long sleep.He yawned, stretched, and at last opened his eyes completely.For two minutes, however, he lay in his bed without moving, as though he were not yet quite certain whether he were awake or still asleep, whether all that was going on around him were real and actual, or the continuation of his confused dreams.Very soon, however, Mr. Golyadkin’s senses began more clearly and more distinctly to receive their habitual and everyday impressions.The dirty green, smoke-begrimed, dusty walls of his little room, with the mahogany chest of drawers and chairs, the table painted red, the sofa covered with American leather of a reddish colour with little green flowers on it, and the clothes taken off in haste overnight and flung in a crumpled heap on the sofa, looked at him familiarly.At last the damp autumn day, muggy and dirty, peeped into the room through the dingy window pane with such a hostile, sour grimace that Mr. Golyadkin could not possibly doubt that he was not in the land of Nod, but in the city of Petersburg, in his own flat on the fourth storey of a huge block of buildings in Shestilavotchny Street.When he had made this important discovery Mr. Golyadkin nervously closed his eyes, as though regretting his dream and wanting to go back to it for a moment.But a minute later he leapt out of bed at one bound, probably all at once, grasping the idea about which his scattered and wandering thoughts had been revolving.From his bed he ran straight to a little round looking-glass that stood on his chest of drawers.Though the sleepy, short-sighted countenance and rather bald head reflected in the looking-glass were of such an insignificant type that at first sight they would certainly not have attracted particular attention in any one, yet the owner of the countenance was satisfied with all that he saw in the looking-glass.“What a thing it would be,” said Mr. Golyadkin in an undertone, “what a thing it would be if I were not up to the mark today, if something were amiss, if some intrusive pimple had made its appearance, or anything else unpleasant had happened; so far, however, there’s nothing wrong, so far everything’s all right.”"
"戈利亚德金先生对一切正常感到特别宽慰，他把梳妆镜放回到原来的地方。尽管他光着脚，身上仍穿着平常的睡衣，但却跑到了窗口，带着极大的兴致开始在寓所窗户所朝的那个庭院里寻找什么东西。显然，他在庭院里所找的东西也使他感到非常满意，他的脸上露出了沾沾自喜的笑容。然后——不过，他先偷窥了一眼他的男仆彼特鲁斯卡在隔壁的小屋，确信彼特鲁斯卡不在里边——他就蹑手蹑脚地走到桌子旁，打开桌子的抽屉，在它最后面的一个角落里乱摸一翻，从黄色旧公文和各种杂物下拿出一个破旧的绿色皮夹，小心翼翼地打开它，认真细心并饶有乐趣地窥视着它最里面、最隐蔽的地方。或许那卷绿的、灰的、蓝的、红的和杂色的钞票也赞许地看着戈利亚德金：他容光焕发，把打开的皮夹放在自己面前，极为满意地用力搓搓手。最后，他把它拿了出来——那卷让他倍感欣慰的钞票——开始自前天以来第一百次数钞票，并且小心翼翼地把每一张钞票都用拇指和食指摸平。","Greatly relieved that everything was all right, Mr Golyadkin put the looking-glass back in its place and, although he had nothing on his feet and was still in the attire in which he was accustomed to go to bed, he ran to the little window and with great interest began looking for something in the courtyard, upon which the windows of his flat looked out.Apparently what he was looking for in the yard quite satisfied him too; his face beamed with a self-satisfied smile.Then, after first peeping, however, behind the partition into his valet Petrushka’s little room and making sure that Petrushka was not there, he went on tiptoe to the table, opened the drawer in it and, fumbling in the furthest corner of it, he took from under old yellow papers and all sorts of rubbish a shabby green pocket-book, opened it cautiously, and with care and relish peeped into the furthest and most hidden fold of it.Probably the roll of green, grey, blue, red and particoloured notes looked at Golyadkin, too, with approval: with a radiant face he laid the open pocket-book before him and rubbed his hands vigorously in token of the greatest satisfaction.Finally, he took it out — his comforting roll of notes — and, for the hundredth time since the previous day, counted them over, carefully smoothing out every note between his forefinger and his thumb."
"“七百五十卢布纸币。”他终于数完了，低声说道。“七百五十卢布，一笔数目可观的钱！这是一笔数目不小的钱。”他用微弱而又喜悦得有点颤抖的声音继续说道，手里捏着那卷钞票，意味深长地微笑着，“这是一笔数目非常可观的钱！一笔对任何人来说数目都不算少的钱！我倒想要见见那个人，对他来说那笔钱不算什么！用那样一笔钱还有什么不能做的呀……“但是，这是怎么回事呀？”戈利亚德金先生想，“彼特鲁斯卡去哪儿了？”他仍然穿着那身衣服，又瞅了一下隔壁。仍然没有彼特鲁斯卡的影子，放在地板上的茶壶发狂了，没人照看，在愤怒，在发脾气，在时时刻刻威胁着要溢出来，发着嘶嘶声，用它那神秘的语言，口齿不清地向戈利亚德金先生说着什么，类似于“端走我吧，好心人，我烧开啦，并且完全烧好啦。”","“Seven hundred and fifty roubles in notes,” he concluded at last, in a half-whisper.“Seven hundred and fifty roubles, a noteworthy sum!It’s an agreeable sum,” he went on, in a voice weak and trembling with gratification, as he pinched the roll with his fingers and smiled significantly; “it’s a very agreeable sum!A sum agreeable to any one!I should like to see the man to whom that would be a trivial sum!There’s no knowing what a man might not do with a sum like that...What’s the meaning of it, though?” thought Mr. Golyadkin; “where’s Petrushka?”And still in the same attire he peeped behind the partition again.Again there was no sign of Petrushka; and the samovar standing on the floor was beside itself, fuming and raging in solitude, threatening every minute to boil over, hissing and lisping in its mysterious language, to Mr. Golyadkin something like, “Take me, good people, I’m boiling and perfectly ready.”"
"“该死的，”戈利亚德金先生想，“那个懒鬼畜生还真能把人逼疯，他现在去哪里鬼混了？”","“Damn the fellow,” thought Mr. Golyadkin.“That lazy brute might really drive a man out of all patience; where’s he dawdling now?”"
"他带着这种愤慨走出去，进了大厅（大厅实际上是一个小走廊，尽头有一扇通向过道的门），看到他的仆人被一大群乌七八糟的仆人们围着，有来自外面的，还有这座公寓寓所里面的。彼特鲁斯卡在讲着什么，其他人都在听。显然，对谈论的话题或是谈话本身，戈利亚德金先生并不喜欢。他马上喊了彼特鲁斯卡，就返回了自己的房间，感到不满，甚至还有些气恼。“那个畜生会为半便士就出卖人，尤其是他的老爷。”他暗自想着，“他已经把我出卖了，他肯定已经出卖了。我确信他已经为四分之一便士把我出卖了。嗯？”","In just indignation he went out into the hall, which consisted of a little corridor at the end of which was a door into the entry, and saw his servant surrounded by a good-sized group of lackeys of all sorts, a mixed rabble from outside as well as from the flats of the house.Petrushka was telling something, the others were listening.Apparently the subject of the conversation, or the conversation itself, did not please Mr. Golyadkin.He promptly called Petrushka and returned to his room, displeased and even upset.“That beast would sell a man for a halfpenny, and his master before any one,” he thought to himself: “and he has sold me, he certainly has.I bet he has sold me for a farthing. Well?”"
"“老爷，他们把制服拿来了。”","“They’ve brought the livery, sir.”"
"“穿上，过来。”","“Put it on, and come here.”"
"彼特鲁斯卡穿好制服后，带着傻呵呵的笑容进了老爷的房间。他的装束极其怪诞。他穿着一身已经磨损不堪的绿色制服，上面有磨损了的金黄色穗带，那明显是为比彼特鲁斯卡高一码的人做的。他的手里拿着一顶帽子，镶着同样的金黄色穗带，并且上面还插着一根羽毛。他腰后面挂着一把插在皮革鞘里的侍者佩戴的剑。最后，为了完善这幅画面，常常习惯于衣冠不整也不修边幅的彼特鲁斯卡还光着脚。戈利亚德金先生上上下下仔细打量着彼特鲁斯卡，似乎很满意。这身制服显然是为了某种严肃的场合而临时租来的。也可以看得出彼特鲁斯卡在老爷审视他时，也带着奇怪的期望注视着老爷，带着明显的好奇心密切注意着老爷的一举一动，这使戈利亚德金先生觉得尤为尴尬。","When he had put on his livery, Petrushka, with a stupid smile on his face, went in to his master.His costume was incredibly strange.He had on a much-worn green livery, with frayed gold braid on it, apparently made for a man a yard taller than Petrushka.In his hand he had a hat trimmed with the same gold braid and with a feather in it, and at his hip hung a footman’s sword in a leather sheath.Finally, to complete the picture, Petrushka, who always liked to be in negligent, was barefooted.Mr. Golyadkin looked at Petrushka from all sides and was apparently satisfied.The livery had evidently been hired for some solemn occasion.It might be observed, too, that during his master’s inspection Petrushka watched him with strange expectance and with marked curiosity followed every movement he made, which extremely embarrassed Mr. Golyadkin."
"“喂，马车呢？”","“Well, and how about the carriage?”"
"“马车也来了。”","“The carriage is here too.”"
"“一整天的？”","“For the whole day? ”"
"“一整天，二十五卢布。”","“For the whole day. Twenty five roubles.”"
"“皮靴也被送来了吗？”","“And have the boots been sent?”"
"“是的。”","“Yes.”"
"“笨蛋！还没学会说‘是的，老爷。’","“Dolt! can’t even say, ‘yes, sir.’"
"把皮靴拿过来。”","Bring them here.”"
"皮靴很合脚，戈利亚德金先生对此表示满意，接着他叫了茶，让人准备了洗漱和刮脸用的水。他仔仔细细地刮了脸，然后小心翼翼地洗掉，匆匆忙忙地呷了口茶，继而开始主要的最后穿戴：他穿了一条几乎崭新的裤子，接着穿了一件有黄铜领扣的衬衫胸衣和一件非常鲜艳又讨人喜欢的绣着花的马甲，他在脖子上系了一条华丽的杂色围巾，最后穿上了大衣。大衣也是颇新的，并且精心擦拭过。他在穿衣时，不止一次深情地瞅着他的皮靴，先抬起一条腿，接着又抬起另一条，欣赏着它们的款式，不停地低声喃喃自语着，还时不时地做出极富表情的怪相。不过那天早上，戈利亚德金先生极其心不在焉，因为他几乎都没有注意到彼特鲁斯卡在帮他穿衣时的嬉皮笑脸和对他做的种种鬼脸。终于，戈利亚德金先生合理地安排好了一切并且穿戴完毕，他把皮夹子放进口袋，最后赞赏地瞅了彼特鲁斯卡一眼。彼特鲁斯卡已经穿好了靴子，所以也完全准备好了，他发现一切都好了，没什么要等的了，就急急忙忙、大惊小怪地跑下了楼，心微微地跳动着。那辆临时租来的、上面有羽冠的浅蓝色马车喧闹着驶近了台阶。彼特鲁斯卡朝车夫和一些目瞪口呆的人使了个眼色，服侍他的老爷进了马车。他勉强忍住傻笑，用极不自然的声音喊道：“走喽！”，便纵身跳上马车的踏足板。于是，人群便咔哒咔哒、轰轰隆隆地嘈杂着朝涅瓦大街驶去。浅蓝色马车刚一冲出大门，戈利亚德金先生就抽搐似的搓着手，轻轻地低声笑着，像一个兴高采烈的人成功地完成了一次很棒的表演，正自鸣得意一样。但欢乐之后，笑容立刻就被戈利亚德金先生脸上那奇怪的忧虑表情代替了。尽管天气潮湿而闷热，但他还是放下了马车两边的窗子，开始细细端详左右来往的行人。一旦认为有人在看着他时，他就立刻佯装出一副端庄稳重、泰然自若的神态。在从铸铁街到涅瓦大街的岔路口，他被一种极不愉快的感觉吓了一跳，像个可怜虫被人无意中踩到了鸡眼那样皱着眉头，几乎惊慌失措地缩进他的马车里最黑暗的一个角落。","Expressing his satisfaction that the boots fitted, Mr. Golyadkin asked for his tea, and for water to wash and shave.He shaved with great care and washed as scrupulously, hurriedly sipped his tea and proceeded to the principal final process of attiring himself: he put on an almost new pair of trousers; then a shirtfront with brass studs, and a very bright and agreeably flowered waistcoat; about his neck he tied a gay, particoloured cravat, and finally drew on his coat, which was also newish and carefully brushed.As he dressed, he more than once looked lovingly at his boots, lifted up first one leg and then the other, admired their shape, kept muttering something to himself, and from time to time made expressive grimaces.Mr. Golyadkin was, however, extremely absent-minded that morning, for he scarcely noticed the little smiles and grimaces made at his expense by Petrushka, who was helping him dress.At last, having arranged everything properly and having finished dressing, Mr. Golyadkin put his pocket-book in his pocket, took a final admiring look at Petrushka, who had put on his boots and was therefore also quite ready, and, noticing that everything was done and that there was nothing left to wait for, he ran hurriedly and fussily out on to the stairs, with a slight throbbing at his heart.The light-blue hired carriage with a crest on it rolled noisily up to the steps.Petrushka, winking to the driver and some of the gaping crowd, helped his master into the carriage; and hardly able to suppress an idiotic laugh, shouted in an unnatural voice: “Off!” jumped up on the footboard, and the whole turnout, clattering and rumbling noisily, rolled into the Nevsky Prospect.As soon as the light-blue carriage dashed out of the gate, Mr. Golyadkin rubbed his hands convulsively and went off into a slow, noiseless chuckle, like a jubilant man who has succeeded in bringing off a splendid performance and is as pleased as Punch with the performance himself.Immediately after his access of gaiety, however, laughter was replaced by a strange and anxious expression on the face of Mr. Golyadkin.Though the weather was damp and muggy, he let down both windows of the carriage and began carefully scrutinizing the passers-by to left and to right, at once assuming a decorous and sedate air when he thought any one was looking at him.At the turning from Liteyny Street into the Nevsky Prospect he was startled by a most unpleasant sensation and, frowning like some poor wretch whose corn has been accidentally trodden on, he huddled with almost panic-stricken haste into the darkest corner of his carriage."
"他看到了自己的两名同僚，两名和他在同一政府部门工作的年轻职员。在戈利亚德金先生看来，那两名年轻职员似乎也对以这样的方式碰到自己的同僚感到非常吃惊。确切地讲，其中一个还向另一个指了指戈利亚德金先生。戈利亚德金先生甚至觉得好像另一个实际上还叫了他的名字，这在街道上当然是很不成体统的。我们的主人公把自己隐藏了起来，没作回应。“傻里傻气的年轻人啊！”他开始暗自寻思着，“嗨，这有什么可奇怪的呀？人家在马车里，人家需要坐在马车里，所以就租了一辆马车。他们只不过是些笨蛋！我了解他们——不过是些傻里傻气的年轻人，还需要鞭打！他们想拿到薪水去耍钱，猜正反面，或者闲逛混时间。他们就适合干这个。真该让他们都明白，只是……”","He had seen two of his colleagues, two young clerks serving in the same government department.The young clerks were also, it seemed to Mr. Golyadkin, extremely amazed at meeting their colleague in such a way; one of them, in fact, pointed him out to the other.Mr. Golyadkin even fancied that the other had actually called his name, which, of course, was very unseemly in the street.Our hero concealed himself and did not respond.“The silly youngsters!” he began reflecting to himself.“Why, what is there strange in it?A man in a carriage, a man needs to be in a carriage, and so he hires a carriage.They’re simply noodles!I know them — simply silly youngsters, who still need thrashing!They want to be paid a salary for playing pitch-farthing and dawdling about, that’s all they’re fit for.It’d let them all know, if only ...”"
"戈利亚德金先生突然停了下来，被吓呆了。戈利亚德金先生非常熟悉的一对灵巧的喀山马，套在一辆时髦的无顶四轮马车上，从他的马车的右边疾驶而过。那位坐在无顶四轮马车里的先生碰巧瞥见了戈利亚德金先生——戈利亚德金先生正带着几分鲁莽，把头伸在马车的窗子外——似乎也对这次意外的相遇感到很吃惊，他尽可能地弓着身子，带着极大的好奇心和兴趣朝马车里我们的主人公慌忙隐藏进去的角落望去。坐在无顶四轮马车里的那位先生是安德雷·菲利波维奇，他是戈利亚德金先生以办公室副主任身份当职的那个部门的办事处主管。戈利亚德金先生看到安德雷·菲利波维奇认出了他，正睁大了眼睛看着他，知道不可能躲藏了，因而脸一直红到了耳根。","Mr. Golyadkin broke off suddenly, petrified.A smart pair of Kazan horses, very familiar to Mr. Golyadkin, in a fashionable droshky, drove rapidly by on the right side of his carriage.The gentleman sitting in the droshky, happening to catch a glimpse of Mr. Golyadkin, who was rather incautiously poking his head out of the carriage window, also appeared to be extremely astonished at the unexpected meeting and, bending out as far as he could, looked with the greatest of curiosity and interest into the corner of the carriage in which our hero made haste to conceal himself.The gentleman in the droshky was Andrey Filippovitch, the head of the office in which Mr. Golyadkin served in the capacity of assistant to the chief clerk.Mr. Golyadkin, seeing that Andrey Filippovitch recognized him, that he was looking at him open-eyed and that it was impossible to hide, blushed up to his ears."
"“要不要点头示意呢？要不要叫他呢？要不要向他打招呼呢？””我们的主人公在难以言状的苦恼中自忖道，“或者假装那不是我，而是长得极其像我的别的什么人，装出一副若无其事的样子。只不过不是我，不是我——这就够了。”戈利亚德金先生说道，对着安德雷·菲利波维奇脱掉了帽子，眼睛一动不动地盯着他。“我……我很好。”他费力地嘀咕着，“我……确实很好。那不是我，那不是我——本来就不是我。”","“Bow or not?Call back or not?Recognize him or not?” our hero wondered in indescribable anguish, “or pretend that I am not myself, but somebody else strikingly like me, and look as though nothing were the matter.Simply not I, not I — and that’s all,” said Mr. Golyadkin, taking off his hat to Andrey Filippovitch and keeping his eyes fixed upon him.“I’m ... I’m all right,” he whispered with an effort; “I’m ... quite all right.It’s not I, it’s not I — and that is the fact of the matter.”"
"不过，那辆无顶四轮马车很快就经过了他的马车，他上司眼睛的磁力也到头了。然而，他还是满脸通红，微笑着，在独自嘀咕着什么……","Soon, however, the droshky passed the carriage, and the magnetism of his chief’s eyes was at an end.Yet he went on blushing, smiling and muttering something to himself..."
"“我没有叫他，真是个傻瓜。”他最后想，“我应该大胆些，表现出绅士般的坦率。我应该说‘事情是这样的，安德雷·菲利波维奇，我也被邀请去参加宴会’，就是这样的！”","“I was a fool not to call back,” he thought at last.“I ought to have taken a bolder line and behaved with gentlemanly openness.I ought to have said ‘This is how it is, Andrey Filippovitch, I’m asked to the dinner too,’ and that’s all it is!”"
"后来，我们的主人公突然想起了他是如何被震惊的，于是像着了火似的满脸通红，皱紧了眉头，用可怕的目光冷冷地瞥了一眼马车前部的那个角落，这一瞥意在把他所有的敌人都化为灰烬。最后，他突发奇想去拉拴在车夫胳膊肘上的细绳，让马车停下，吩咐他返回铸铁街。原来，大概是为了他自己内心的平静，戈利亚德金先生迫切需要对他的医生克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇说一些非常有趣的事情。虽然他不久前才刚认识克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇，其实只拜访过他一次，也就是上星期去向他咨询过一些症状。但是，如俗语所说的，医生就像是个牧师，对他隐瞒是愚蠢的，而了解自己的病人确实是他的职责。“不过，这样好吗？”我们的主人公在铸铁街一座五层的公寓门口吩咐车夫停车，下了马车，继续琢磨着，“这样可以吗？这合适吗？这恰当吗？可是，毕竟，”他一边气喘吁吁地上楼，尽力压抑着自己的心跳（他有每次爬别人家的楼梯就心跳的习惯），一边继续想着，“毕竟那是我自己的事，而且没什么可谴责的……隐瞒才是愚蠢的。哎呀，当然，我要表现得我确实很好，只不过路过时顺便来看看……他将会看到事情就是它本该的这个样子。”","Then, suddenly recalling how taken aback he had been, our hero flushed as hot as fire, frowned, and cast a terrible defiant glance at the front corner of the carriage, a glance calculated to reduce all his foes to ashes.At last, he was suddenly inspired to pull the cord attached to the driver’s elbow, and stopped the carriage, telling him to drive back to Liteyny Street.The fact was, it was urgently necessary for Mr. Golyadkin, probably for the sake of his own peace of mind, to say something very interesting to his doctor, Krestyan Ivanovitch.And, though he had made Krestyan Ivanovitch’s acquaintance quite recently, having, indeed, only paid him a single visit, and that one the previous week, to consult him about some symptom.But a doctor, as they say, is like a priest, and it would be stupid for him to keep out of sight, and, indeed, it was his duty to know his patients.“Will it be all right, though,” our hero went on, getting out of the carriage at the door of a five-storey house in Liteyny Street, at which he had told the driver to stop the carriage: “Will it be all right?Will it be proper?Will it be appropriate?After all, though,” he went on, thinking as he mounted the stairs out of breath and trying to suppress that beating of his heart, which had the habit of beating on all other people’s staircases: “After all, it’s on my own business and there’s nothing reprehensible in it...It would be stupid to keep out of sight.Why, of course, I shall behave as though I were quite all right, and have simply looked in as I passed...He will see that it’s all just as it should be.”"
"戈利亚德金先生就这样思考着，爬到了第二层，在五号寓所前停了下来，那上面有一个美观的黄铜门牌，刻着：","Reasoning like this, Mr. Golyadkin mounted to the second storey and stopped before flat number five, on which there was a handsome brass door-plate with the inscription —"
"医学博士兼外科医师克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇·鲁腾什皮茨","KRESTYAN IVANOVITCH RUTENSPITZ Doctor of Medicine and Surgery"
"我们的主人公停在门口，匆忙装出一副得体、从容、甚至还有些和蔼亲切的神态，准备好去拉门铃。他正要这样做时，立刻而且又颇为适当地考虑到明天来可能会更好一些，这暂时也并不十分紧急。但是，因为他突然听到了楼梯上的脚步声，便又马上改变了主意，立即按响了克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇家的门铃——而且带着一种非常坚定的神情。","Stopping at the door, our hero made haste to assume an air of propriety, ease, and even of a certain affability, and prepared to pull the bell.As he was about to do so he promptly and rather appropriately reflected that it might be better to come tomorrow, and that it was not very pressing for the moment.But as he suddenly heard footsteps on the stairs, he immediately changed his mind again and at once rang Krestyan Ivanovitch’s bell — with an air, moreover, of great determination."
"第二章","CHAPTER 2"
"这位医学博士兼外科医师克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇·鲁腾什皮茨尽管上了年纪，但身体却很硬朗。他眉毛浓浓的，胡须开始变得灰白，眼神极富表情，看上去能够驱走所有的疾病，最后，他胸前还佩戴着荣誉勋章。那天早上，他正坐在自己门诊室舒适的扶手椅里。他一边喝着太太亲手端来的咖啡，一边抽着烟，还时不时地给病人开着处方。给一位患有痔疮的老人开了一瓶药水，并看着这位年迈的患者从侧门出去后，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇坐了下来，等待下一位患者。","The doctor of medicine and surgery, Krestyan Ivanovitch Rutenspitz, a very hale though elderly man, with thick eyebrows and whiskers that were beginning to turn grey, eyes with an expressive gleam in them that looked capable of routing every disease, and, lastly, with orders of some distinction on his breast, was sitting in his consulting-room that morning in his comfortable armchair.He was drinking coffee, which his wife had brought him with her own hand, smoking a cigar and from time to time writing prescriptions for his patients.After prescribing a draught for an old man who was suffering from haemorrhoids and seeing the aged patient out by the side door, Krestyan Ivanovitch sat down to await the next visitor."
"戈利亚德金先生走了进来。","Mr. Golyadkin walked in."
"显然，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇压根就没料到戈利亚德金先生会来，也不想看见他，因为他突然大吃一惊，脸上不由地露出一副冷淡的、几乎可以说是不满的表情。因为戈利亚德金先生几乎总是会不合适宜地出现，并且一跟人家提起自己琐碎的私事就会不知所措，乱成一团。这次也一样，他极为困窘。他还没准备好第一句话（这总是他在这种场合下的绊脚石），只是嘀咕了句什么——显然是道歉的话——因为不知道接下来该怎么办了，他便拿了把椅子，坐下来，但是，认识到自己这是不请自坐，他立刻意识到了自己的失礼，于是迅速地从那个不请自坐的座位上站了起来，以赶紧抹去自己的不懂礼节和缺乏教养。接着，进一步考虑之后，他隐隐约约地意识到自己已经犯了两个愚蠢的错误了，便立即决定再犯一个——也就是，努力去纠正自己，嘟囔了句什么，笑了一下，脸涨得通红，窘迫难堪，陷入意味深长的沉默，最后，一屁股坐下去，愣是没再起来。不过，为了保护自己，以防万一，他以挑衅的目光瞪着医生，这目光有着非比寻常的力量，能够让戈利亚德金先生的敌人心理崩溃，让他们化为灰烬。而且，这一瞥还充分表现了戈利亚德金先生的自立——简单地说，也就是戈利亚德金先生“一切都好”，他“确实是他自己，像其他人一样”，而且“他的脑子也没什么问题”。克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇咳了几声，清了清嗓子，明显对这一切表示赞许和同意，接着便把审判官似的疑问的目光投向了这位来访者。","Apparently Krestyan Ivanovitch did not in the least expect nor desire to see Mr. Golyadkin, for he was suddenly taken aback for a moment, and his countenance unconsciously assumed a strange and, one may almost say, a displeased expression.As Mr. Golyadkin almost always turned up inappropriately and was thrown into confusion whenever he approached any one about his own little affairs, on this occasion, too, he was desperately embarrassed.Having neglected to get ready his first sentence, which was invariably a stumbling-block for him on such occasions, he muttered something—apparently an apology—and, not knowing what to do next, took a chair and sat down, but, realizing that he had sat down without being asked to do so, he was immediately conscious of his lapse, and made haste to efface his offence against etiquette and good breeding by promptly getting up again from the seat he had taken uninvited.Then, on second thoughts, dimly perceiving that he had committed two stupid blunders at once, he immediately decided to commit a third—that is, tried to right himself, muttered something, smiled, blushed, was overcome with embarrassment, sank into expressive silence, and finally sat down for good and did not get up again.Only, to protect himself from all contingencies, he looked at the doctor with that defiant glare which had an extraordinary power of figuratively crushing Mr. Golyadkin’s enemies and reducing them to ashes.This glance, moreover, expressed to the full Mr. Golyadkin’s independence—that is, to speak plainly, the fact that Mr. Golyadkin was “all right,” that he was “quite himself, like everybody else,” and that there was “nothing wrong in his upper storey.”Krestyan Ivanovitch coughed, cleared his throat, apparently in token of approval and assent to all this, and bent an inquisitorial interrogative gaze upon his visitor."
"“克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇，我又来麻烦你了。”戈利亚德金先生微笑着开口说，“现在，我斗胆请你再次包涵……”他显然不知如何措辞了。","“I have come to trouble you a second time, Krestyan Ivanovitch,” began Mr. Golyadkin, with a smile, “and now I venture to ask your indulgence a second time...”He was obviously at a loss for words."
"“唔……是啊！”克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇吐出一缕轻烟，把他的雪茄放在桌子上，说道，“但是，你必须遵从医嘱，我已经向你解释过了，有利于你健康的就是改变习惯……比如说娱乐，还有交朋友——你应该去拜访拜访你的亲朋好友，不要对酒有敌意，同样也要快快乐乐地与人交往。”","“H’m... Yes!” pronounced Krestyan Ivanovitch, puffing out a spiral of smoke and putting down his cigar on the table, “but you must follow the treatment prescribed to you; I explained to you that what would be beneficial to your health is a change of habits...Entertainment, for instance, and, well, friends—you should visit your acquaintances, and not be hostile to the bottle; and likewise keep cheerful company.”"
"戈利亚德金先生仍旧带着微笑，急忙说他认为自己和其他所有人一样，独自生活，和其他人一样有娱乐活动……当然，他也会去剧院，因为他和其他人一样有钱，他白天呆在办公室，晚上呆在家里，他很正常。他甚至还顺便说到，在他看来，他和别人一样优秀，他住在家里，最后，他还有彼特鲁斯卡。这时，戈利亚德金先生迟疑了一下。","Mr. Golyadkin, still smiling, hastened to observe that he thought he was like every one else, that he lived by himself, that he had entertainments like every one else... that, of course, he might go to the theatre, for he had the means like every one else, that he spent the day at the office and the evenings at home, that he was quite all right; he even observed, in passing, that he was, so far as he could see, as good as any one, that he lived at home, and finally, that he had Petrushka.At this point Mr. Golyadkin hesitated."
"“唔！不，那样的安排不是我希望的，那个根本不是我要问你的。我想大致了解一下，你是不是喜爱快乐地交际？你趁节日之际做些什么吗？还有，你是以沮丧还是快乐的方式在生活呢？”","“H’m!no, that is not the order of proceeding that I want; and that is not at all what I would ask you.I am interested to know, in general, are you a great lover of cheerful company?Do you take advantages of festive occasions; and well, do you lead a melancholy or cheerful manner of life?”"
"“克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇，我……”","“Krestyan Ivanovitch, I...”"
"“唔！……我告诉你，”医生打断了他，“你的生活必须要彻底改变，在某种意义上，必须冲破你的性格。”（克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇特别强调了“冲破”这个词，并带着意味深长的神态停顿了一会儿。）“绝不能退避快乐，必须要参加娱乐活动，去逛俱乐部，还有，无论如何，都不要对酒怀有敌意。你不宜坐在家里……对你来说，坐在家里是绝对不行的。”","“H’m!... I tell you,” interrupted the doctor, “that you must have a radical change of life, must, in a certain sense, break in your character.” (Krestyan Ivanovitch laid special stress on the word “break in,” and paused for a moment with a very significant air.) “Must not shrink from gaiety, must visit entertainments and clubs, and in any case, be not hostile to the bottle.Sitting at home is not right for you ... sitting at home is impossible for you.”"
"“我喜欢安静，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇。”戈利亚德金先生说道，他意味深长地看着医生，显然在寻找更能充分表达他想法的词语，“在我的寓所里，只有我和彼特鲁斯卡……我说的是我的男仆，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇。我是想说，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇，我走我的路，我自己的路，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇。我不太与人来往，并且我觉得我很独立。我也出去散步的，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇。”","“I like quiet, Krestyan Ivanovitch,” said Mr. Golyadkin, with a significant look at the doctor and evidently seeking words to express his ideas more successfully: “In my flat there’s only me and Petrushka...I mean my man, Krestyan Ivanovitch.I mean to say, Krestyan Ivanovitch, that I go my way, my own way, Krestyan Ivanovitch.I keep myself to myself, and so far as I can see am not dependent on any one.I go out for walks, too, Krestyan Ivanovitch.”"
"“什么？哦！可是，最近也不适合散步呀，这天儿太糟了。”","“What?Yes! well, nowadays there’s nothing agreeable in walking: the climate’s extremely bad.”"
"“确实如此，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇。尽管我是个不爱争吵的人，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇，就像我曾有幸向你解释过的那样，可是我的路已经同别人分开了，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇。生活方式是多种多样的……我的意思是……我要说的是，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇……真是不好意思，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇，我这人笨嘴笨舌的。”","“Quite so, Krestyan Ivanovitch.Though I’m a peaceable man, Krestyan Ivanovitch, as I’ve had the honour of explaining to you already, yet my way lies apart, Krestyan Ivanovitch.The ways of life are manifold... I mean... I mean to say, Krestyan Ivanovitch...Excuse me, Krestyan Ivanovitch, I’ve no great gift for eloquent speaking.”"
"“唔……你说……”","“H’m... you say...”"
"“我说，你必须原谅我，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇，在我看来，我并非能说会道。”戈利亚德金先生用有点委屈的声音说着，结结巴巴，迟疑不决。“在这一方面，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇，我不像其他人。”他带着一种奇怪的微笑，接着说道，“我不善言谈，也从未学过说漂亮话。在另一方面，我会做事，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇；在另一方面，我会做事，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇。”","“I say, you must excuse me, Krestyan Ivanovitch, that as far as I can see I am no great hand at eloquence in speaking,” Mr. Golyadkin articulated, stammering and hesitating, in a half-aggrieved voice.“In that respect, Krestyan Ivanovitch, I’m not quite like other people,” he added, with a peculiar smile, “I can’t talk much, and have never learnt to embellish my speech with literary graces.On the other hand, I act, Krestyan Ivanovitch; on the other hand, I act, Krestyan Ivanovitch.”"
"“唔……这是怎么回事……你会做事？”克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇反问道。","“H’m... How’s that... you act?” responded Krestyan Ivanovitch."
"紧接着是半分钟的沉默。医生有些冷淡地、不信任地瞅着他的这位来访者。而戈利亚德金先生也相当不信任地偷偷看了医生一眼。","Then silence followed for half a minute.The doctor looked somewhat strangely and mistrustfully at his visitor.Mr. Golyadkin, for his part, too, stole a rather mistrustful glance at the doctor."
"“克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇，”他又开始了，和之前的语气一样，多少有点生气，而且对医生极端的固执有些困惑不解，“我喜欢平静，而不是社交界闹哄哄的快乐。处在他们中间，我的意思是说，在吵吵闹闹的社交界，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇，一个人必须得会用靴子擦地板……”（这时，戈利亚德金先生用他的脚趾稍微蹭了一下地板），“他们希望这样，他们也想听俏皮话……你必须得懂得如何进行芳香四溢的恭维……这就是他们在那里所期待的。而我没学过这一套，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇，我从未学习过所有那些鬼把戏，我从来没有那个功夫。我是个普通人，不够机敏，而且我不玩虚的。在那一方面，我投降，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇，从那种意义上说，我甘拜下风。”","“Krestyan Ivanovitch,” he began, going on again in the same tone as before, somewhat irritated and puzzled by the doctor’s extreme obstinacy: “I like tranquillity and not the noisy gaiety of the world.Among them, I mean, in the noisy world, Krestyan Ivanovitch, one must be able to polish the floor with one’s boots...” (here Mr. Golyadkin made a slight scrape on the floor with his toe); “they expect it, and they expect puns too... one must know how to make a perfumed compliment... that’s what they expect there.And I’ve not learnt to do it, Krestyan Ivanovitch, I’ve never learnt all those tricks, I’ve never had the time.I’m a simple person, and not ingenious, and I’ve no external polish.On that side I surrender, Krestyan Ivanovitch, I lay down my arms, speaking in that sense.”"
"戈利亚德金先生宣布这一切时带着一种神情，这种神情非常清楚地表示出我们的主人公对自己在那种意义上甘拜下风，以及没有学过这些鬼把戏根本谈不上后悔，实际上，正好相反。克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇在听他讲时，低着头，脸上带着一种很不愉快的表情，似乎对什么东西有种不祥之感。戈利亚德金先生的长篇演说后，紧接着是一段长时间的、意味深长的沉默。","All this Mr. Golyadkin pronounced with an air which made it perfectly clear that our hero was far from regretting that he was laying down his arms in that sense and that he had not learnt these tricks; quite the contrary, indeed.As Krestyan Ivanovitch listened to him, he looked down with a very unpleasant grimace on his face, seeming to have a presentiment of something.Mr. Golyadkin’s tirade was followed by a rather long and significant silence."
"“我认为你有点偏题了。”克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇最后低声说道，“我承认我无法完全明白你的意思。”","“You have, I think, departed a little from the subject,” Krestyan Ivanovitch said at last, in a low voice: “I confess I cannot altogether understand you.”"
"“我是个不善言辞的人，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇，我已经有幸告诉你了，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇。”戈利亚德金先生说道，这次的语气生硬而坚决。","“I’m not a great hand at eloquent speaking, Krestyan Ivanovitch; I’ve had the honour to inform you, Krestyan Ivanovitch, already,” said Mr. Golyadkin, speaking this time in a sharp and resolute tone."
"“唔……”","“H’m!” ..."
"“克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇！”戈利亚德金先生又开始了，声音低沉但更意味深长，显得有几分郑重，还强调着每一点，“克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇，我一来这里就开始道歉。我再重说一遍，再次请你包涵。我没必要隐瞒这个，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇。我是个无足轻重的人物，你知道的，但幸运的是，对我来说，我不后悔做一个无关紧要的人。其实正相反，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇，非常坦率地说，我为自己不是个重要人物，而是个无关紧要的人而自豪。我不是个耍阴谋诡计的人，而我也为此感到骄傲，我做事从不偷偷摸摸，而是光明正大，没什么心计，尽管我也可以做害人的事，而且其实是很大的伤害，知道去伤害谁，以及如何去做，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇，然而，我不会玷污我自己，从那种意义上说，我洁身自好。我是说，从那种意义上讲，我洁身自好，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇！”戈利亚德金先生意味深长地略停了一会儿，他说话带着几分狂热。","“Krestyan Ivanovitch!” began Mr. Golyadkin again in a low but more significant voice in a somewhat solemn style and emphasizing every point: “Krestyan Ivanovitch, when I came in here I began with apologies.I repeat the same thing again, and again ask for your indulgence.There’s no need for me to conceal it, Krestyan Ivanovitch.I’m an unimportant man, as you know; but fortunately for me, I do not regret being an unimportant man.Quite the contrary, indeed, Krestyan Ivanovitch, and, to be perfectly frank, I’m proud that I’m not a great man but an unimportant man.I’m not one to intrigue and I’m proud of that too, I don’t act on the sly, but openly, without cunning, and although I could do harm too, and a great deal of harm, indeed, and know to whom and how to do it, Krestyan Ivanovitch, yet I won’t sully myself, and in that sense I wash my hands.In that sense, I say, I wash them, Krestyan Ivanovitch!”Mr. Golyadkin paused expressively for a moment; he spoke with mild fervour."
"“我做事，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇，”我们的主人公继续说道，“直来直去，毫不隐瞒，从不兜圈子，因为我鄙视它们，谁爱搞就让他们搞去吧。我不是想设法侮辱那些或许比你和我还要正派的人……就是说，我说的是，我和他们，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇——我不是说你。我不喜欢含沙射影，对卑劣的口是心非没有兴趣，我厌恶诽谤和诬蔑。我只在化妆舞会上才戴面具，而平日里我不在人前戴的。我只问你，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇，你会如何报复你的敌人，你最恶毒的敌人——那个你认为是这样的？”戈利亚德金先生以挑衅的目光扫视了克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇一眼，结束了他的话。","“I set to work, Krestyan Ivanovitch,” our hero continued, “directly, openly, by no devious ways, for I disdain them, and leave them to others.I do not try to degrade those who are perhaps purer than you and I... that is, I mean, I and they, Krestyan Ivanovitch—I didn’t mean you.I don’t like insinuations; I’ve no taste for contemptible duplicity; I’m disgusted by slander and calumny.I only put on a mask at a masquerade, and don’t wear one before people every day.I only ask you, Krestyan Ivanovitch, how you would revenge yourself upon your enemy, your most malignant enemy—the one you would consider such?”Mr. Golyadkin concluded with a challenging glance at Krestyan Ivanovitch."
"尽管戈利亚德金先生把这些说得再清楚明白不过了，还满怀自信地斟酌字句，估计着它们可能达到的效果，但与此同时，他看着克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇，还是感到不安，很不安，极其不安。现在，他目不转睛，带着一种急躁而痛苦的不耐烦，怯生生地等着医生的回答。但令我们的主人公困惑不解和完全惊愕的是，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇只是喃喃自语了些什么，之后，他把自己的扶手椅朝桌子那边移了移，尽管客气但却相当冷淡地说了些什么，意思是他时间宝贵，他不是很明白，然而他愿意尽自己所能去照料他，可他不会进一步参与跟他无关的任何事。这时，他拿起笔，拉过来一张纸，剪下通常的处方那么长的一条，说他会立即开需要的所有药。","Though Mr. Golyadkin pronounced this with the utmost distinctness and clearness, weighing his words with a self-confident air and reckoning on their probable effect, yet meanwhile he looked at Krestyan Ivanovitch with anxiety, with great anxiety, with extreme anxiety.Now he was all eyes: and timidly waited for the doctor’s answer with irritable and agonized impatience.But to the perplexity and complete amazement of our hero, Krestyan Ivanovitch only muttered something to himself; then he moved his armchair up to the table, and rather drily though politely announced something to the effect that his time was precious, and that he did not quite understand; that he was ready, however, to attend to him as far as he was able, but he wold not go into anything further that did not concern him.At this point he took the pen, drew a piece of paper towards him, cut out of it the usual long strip, and announced that he would immediately prescribe what was necessary."
"“不，没有必要，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇！　不，那根本没必要！”戈利亚德金先生说着，从他的座位上站了起来，紧紧地抓住了克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇的右手，“那不是我想要的，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇。”","“No, it’s not necessary, Krestyan Ivanovitch!No, that’s not necessary at all!” said Mr. Golyadkin, getting up from his seat, and clutching Krestyan Ivanovitch’s right hand.“That isn’t what’s wanted, Krestyan Ivanovitch.”"
"他在说这些时，感到了一种奇怪的变化。他的灰色双眼奇怪地闪烁着，嘴唇开始颤动，脸上的所有肌肉和整个脸部开始抽动。他浑身都在发抖。戈利亚德金先生松开了医生的手，接着一动不动地站着，似乎对自己没有一点信心，而是在等待进一步行动的激励。","And, while he said this, a queer change came over him.His grey eyes gleamed strangely, his lips began to quiver, all the muscles, all the features of his face began moving and working.He was trembling all over.After stopping the doctor’s hand, Mr. Golyadkin followed his first movement by standing motionless, as though he had no confidence in himself and were waiting for some inspiration for further action."
"接着是一个相当奇怪的场面。","Then followed a rather strange scene."
"克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇有点困惑不解，片刻间好像长在椅子上了，睁大眼睛，迷惑地盯着戈利亚德金先生，而戈利亚德金先生也以完全相同的方式看着他。最后，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇轻轻地抓住戈利亚德金先生的大衣衬里，站了起来。他们两个就像那样站了几秒钟，一动也不动，彼此盯着对方。然而接着，戈利亚德金先生以一种十分奇怪的方式做出了他的第二个动作。他嘴唇颤抖，下巴开始抽动，竟出乎意料地大哭起来。他哭泣着，摇着头，用右手敲打着自己的胸脯，而左手抓着医生的外套衬里，努力想说些什么，做出一些解释，但却说不出一个字。","Somewhat perplexed, Krestyan Ivanovitch seemed for a moment rooted to his chair and gazed open-eyed in bewilderment at Mr. Golyadkin, who looked at him in exactly the same way.At last Krestyan Ivanovitch stood up, gently holding the lining of Mr. Golyadkin’s coat.For some seconds they both stood like that, motionless, with their eyes fixed on each other.Then, however, in an extraordinarily strange way came Mr. Golyadkin’s second movement.His lips trembled, his chin began twitching, and our hero quite unexpectedly burst into tears.Sobbing, shaking his head and striking himself on the chest with his right hand, while with his left clutching the lining of the doctor’s coat, he tried to say something and to make some explanation but could not utter a word."
"最终，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇从惊愕中回过神来了。","At last Krestyan Ivanovitch recovered from his amazement."
"“来，冷静点！”他最终说道，设法使戈利亚德金先生坐在扶手椅里。","“Come, calm yourself!” he brought out at last, trying to make Mr. Golyadkin sit down in an armchair."
"“我有敌人，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇，我有敌人，我有恶毒的敌人，他们发誓要毁掉我……”戈利亚德金先生害怕地低声回答道。","“I have enemies, Krestyan Ivanovitch, I have enemies; I have malignant enemies who have sworn to ruin me...” Mr Golyadkin answered in a frightened whisper."
"“得啦，得啦，为何是敌人？不要再说什么敌人了！真的不必要。坐下，坐下。”克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇接着说道，最终让戈利亚德金先生坐在了扶手椅里。","“Come, come, why enemies?you mustn’t talk about enemies!You really mustn’t.Sit down, sit down,” Krestyan Ivanovitch went on, getting Mr. Golyadkin once and for all into the armchair."
"戈利亚德金先生终于坐下了，眼睛仍然盯着医生。克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇带着极为不满的神态从屋子的一端踱到另一端。接下来是长时间的沉默。","Mr. Golyadkin sat down at last, still keeping his eyes fixed on the doctor.With an extremely displeased air, Krestyan Ivanovitch strode from one end of the room to another.A long silence followed."
"“我感激你，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇，我非常感激，我现在完全认识到你为我所做的一切了。我在有生之年，绝对不会忘记你的仁慈善良的，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇。”戈利亚德金先生说着，从座位上站起来，带着一种忿忿不已的神情。","“I’m grateful to you, Krestyan Ivanovitch, I’m very grateful, and I’m very sensible of all you’ve done for me now.To my dying day I shall never forget your kindness, Krestyan Ivanovitch,” said Mr. Golyadkin, getting up from his seat with an offended air."
"“得了，别再说这了！我告诉你，打住吧！”克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇对戈利亚德金先生的感情迸发作出相当严厉的回应，又让他坐了下来。","“Come, give over!I tell you, give over!”Krestyan Ivanovitch responded rather sternly to Mr. Golyadkin’s outburst, making him sit down again."
"“嗯，什么事？告诉我有什么令人不快的事。”克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇继续说，“还有，你说的是什么敌人？出什么事啦？”","“Well , what’s the matter?Tell me what is unpleasant,” Krestyan Ivanovitch went on, “and what enemies are you talking about?What is wrong?”"
"“不，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇，我们现在最好不谈那个。”戈利亚德金先生垂下目光，回答道，“让我们把这一切暂且放一放吧……直到另外一个时间，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇，直到一个更合适的时机，到时一切都查明了，某些人脸上的面具脱掉了，而且有些事变得众所周知了。但此时，现在，当然，在我们说了这些之后……你自己会同意的，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇……允许我祝你早安，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇。”戈利亚德金先生说着，严肃而坚决地站起来，拿起他的帽子。","“No, Krestyan Ivanovitch, we’d better leave that now,” answered Mr. Golyadkin, casting down his eyes; “let us put all that aside for the time...Till another time, Krestyan Ivanovitch, till a more convenient moment, when everything will be discovered and the mask falls off certain faces, and something comes to light.But, meanwhile, now, of course, after what has passed between us... you will agree yourself, Krestyan Ivanovitch...Allow me to wish you good morning, Krestyan Ivanovitch,” said Mr. Golyadkin, getting up gravely and resolutely and taking his hat."
"“哦，好吧……随便你……唔……”（紧接着是一阵沉默。）“就我而言，你知道……无论我能做什么……我衷心地祝你一切都好。”","“Oh, well... as you like... h’m...” (A moment of silence followed.)“For my part, you know... whatever I can do... and I sincerely wish you well.”"
"“我明白你的意思，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇，我明白，我现在完全明白了……无论如何，请原谅我给你带来的麻烦，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇。”","“I understand you, Krestyan Ivanovitch, I understand: I understand you perfectly now ... In any case excuse me for having troubled you, Krestyan Ivanovitch.”"
"“唔，不，我不是那个意思。不过，随你吧，继续像以前一样吃药……”","“H’m, no, I didn’t mean that.However, as you please; go on taking the medicines as before...”"
"“我会照你说的吃药的，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇。我会继续吃的，而且我会从同一家药店里买药……现在，干药剂师这行不错，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇……”","“I will go with the medicines as you say, Krestyan Ivanovitch.I will go on with them, and I will get them at the same chemist’s... To be a chemist nowadays, Krestyan Ivanovitch, is an important business...”"
"“怎么回事啊？你是从什么意义上说的？”","“How so?In what sense do you mean?”"
"“从十分普通的意义上啊，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇。我说的是，现在就这世道……”","“In a very ordinary sense, Krestyan Ivanovitch.I mean to say that nowadays that’s the way of the world...”"
"“唔……”","“H’m...”"
"“每个傻头傻脑的年轻人，不仅仅是药店的伙计，都在正派人面前把鼻子翘得高高的。”","“And that every silly youngster, not only a chemist’s boy turns up his nose at respectable people.”"
"“唔。你怎么看这个？”","“H’m. How do you understand that?”"
"“我说的是某个人，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇……我们都认识的一个人，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇，是费拉基米尔·谢苗诺维奇……”","“I’m speaking of a certain person, Krestyan Ivanovitch... of a common acquaintance of ours, Krestyan Ivanovitch, of Vladimir Semyonovitch...”"
"“啊！”","“Ah!”"
"“是的，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇，我知道有些人，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇，有些时候，他们不遵守讲真话的常规。”","“Yes, Krestyan Ivanovitch: and I know certain people, Krestyan Ivanovitch, who didn’t keep to the general rule of telling the truth, sometimes.”"
"“啊！怎么这么说？”","“Ah! How so?”"
"“嗨，真的，就是这样的，但是那无关紧要，他们有时会请你吃肉酱鸡蛋。”","“Why, yes, it is so: but that’s neither here nor there: they sometimes manage to serve you up a fine egg in gravy.”"
"“什么？请吃什么？”","“What? Serve up what?”"
"“肉酱鸡蛋，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇。这是句俄国谚语。比如，他们知道如何在适当的时候向别人道贺。有那样的人。”","“An egg in gravy, Krestyan Ivanovitch.It’s a Russian saying.They know how to congratulate some one the right moment, for instance; there are people like that.”"
"“道贺？”","“Congratulate?”"
"“是的，道贺，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇，就像我非常熟悉的一个人前几天做的那样！”","“yes, congratulate, Krestyan Ivanovitch, as some one I know very well did the other day!” ..."
"“你非常熟悉的一个人……啊！那是怎么回事呀？”克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇说道，他专注地看着戈利亚德金先生。","“Some one you know very well... Ah! how was that?” said Krestyan Ivanovitch, looking attentively at Mr. Golyadkin."
"“真的，一个我很熟悉的人的确向另外一个我也很了解的人道贺——而且是朋友，他的知心朋友。他祝贺他升官，并且官升至八品。就这样恰好提到了：‘能有机会向你道贺，费拉基米尔·谢苗诺维奇，我特别地高兴，衷心地祝贺你官升八品。","“Yes, some one I know very well indeed congratulated some one else I know very well—and, what’s more, a comrade, a friend of his heart, on his promotion, on his receiving the rank of assessor.This was how it happened to come up: ‘I am exceedingly glad of the opportunity to offer you, Vladimir Semyonovitch, my congratulations, my sincere congratulations, on your receiving the rank of assessor."
"我更高兴，因为谁都知道现在有老女人能预知未来。’”","And I’m the more pleased, as all the world knows that there are old women nowadays who tell fortunes.’”"
"此时，戈利亚德金先生诡秘地点点头，眯起眼睛，看着克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇……","At this point Mr. Golyadkin gave a sly nod, and screwing up his eyes, looked at Krestyan Ivanovitch..."
"“唔。那么，他那样说了……”","“H’m. So he said that...”"
"“他说了，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇，他那样说了，还立刻瞅了一眼我们的王子费拉基米尔·谢苗诺维奇的舅舅安德雷·菲利波维奇。但是，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇，他当了八品官，和我有什么关系呢？那和我有什么关系呢？我说句不好听的，嘴上的乳臭还未干，他还想结婚。我就说这么多。费拉基米尔·谢苗诺维奇，我说的！现在我把一切都说了，请允许我告退。”","“He did, Krestyan Ivanovitch, he said it and glanced at once at Andrey Filippovitch, the uncle of our Prince Charming, Vladimir Semyonovitch.But what is it to me, Krestyan Ivanovitch, that he has been made an assessor?What is it to me?And he wants to get married and the milk is scarcely dry on his lips, if I may be allowed the expression.And I said as much.Vladimir Semyonovitch, said I!I’ve said everything now; allow me to withdraw.”"
"“唔……”","“H’m...”"
"“真的，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇，我说现在请允许我告退。但为了一石二鸟，我在用老女人取笑我们那位年轻的先生时，转向了克拉拉·奥尔苏菲耶芙娜（这一切都发生在同一天，就是前天在奥尔苏菲·伊万诺维奇的家里），她刚刚有感情地唱了一首歌，‘夫人，你唱得很有感情，’我说，‘但听歌的人心灵却不纯洁。’这话我带有明显的暗示，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇，明显地暗示他们现在并不是在追求她，而在谋求更高的权位……”","“Yes, Krestyan Ivanovitch, allow me now, I say, to withdraw.But, to kill two birds with one stone, as I twitted our young gentleman with the old women, I turned to Klara Olsufyevna (it all happened the same day, before yesterday at Olsufy Ivanovitch’s), and she had only just sung a song with feeling, ‘You’ve sung songs of feeling, madam,’ said I, ‘but they’ve not been listened to with a pure heart.’ And by that I hinted plainly, Krestyan Ivanovitch, hinted plainly, that they were not running after her now, but looking higher ...”"
"“啊！那他说了什么？”","“Ah! And what did he say?”"
"“正如俗语所说，他吞下了药丸，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇。”","“He swallowed the pill, Krestyan Ivanovitch, as the saying is.”"
"“唔……”","“H’m...”"
"“真的，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇。我也对那位老人本人说过，‘奥尔苏菲·伊万诺维奇，’我说，‘我知道我多蒙了您的恩赐，我万分感谢从儿时起您就给予我的所有关怀。但是，睁开您的双眼，奥尔苏菲·伊万诺维奇。’我说，‘您四下看看。我自己做事毫不隐瞒，开诚布公，奥尔苏菲·伊万诺维奇。’”","“Yes, Krestyan Ivanovitch.To the old man himself, too, I said, ‘Olsufy Ivanovitch,’ said I, ‘I know how much I’m indebted to you, I appreciate to the full all the kindness you’ve showered upon me from my childhood up.But open your eyes, Olsufy Ivanovitch,’ I said.‘Look about you.I myself do things openly and aboveboard, Olsufy Ivanovitch.’”"
"“噢，原来是这样！”","“Oh, really!”"
"“真的，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇。真的……”","“Yes, Krestyan Ivanovitch.Really ...”"
"“那他说什么了？”","“What did he say?”"
"“哦，其实，他能说什么啊，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇？他嘀咕着这个那个，说什么‘我了解你’，‘阁下大人是个乐善好施的人’——就这样瞎扯……可是，得啦，你知道的！他开始有点颤巍巍了，正如他们说的，人老了。”","“Yes, what, indeed, Krestyan Ivanovitch?He mumbled one thing and another, and ‘I know you,’ and that ‘his Excellency was a benevolent man’ —he rambled on... But, there, you know!he’s begun to be a bit shaky, as they say, with old age.”"
"“啊！所以，就成现在这样了……”","“Ah! So that’s how it is now...”"
"“是的，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇。我们都那样的！可怜的老人啊！如常言所说，他行将就木，奄奄一息，可他们像女人那样闲扯，他都听了进去，没有他，他们不会……”","“Yes, Krestyan Ivanovitch.And that’s how we all are!Poor old man!He looks towards the grave, breathes incense, as they say, while they concoct a piece of womanish gossip and he listens to it; without him they wouldn’t...”"
"“你说闲言碎语？”","“Gossip, you say?”"
"“是的，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇，他们编了个老娘们的丑闻。我们那狗熊也插了一指，还有他的外甥，我们的王子。他们和老女人们联手了，无疑，他们捏造了那件事。你会相信吗？他们策划要谋杀某个人！……”","“Yes, Krestyan Ivanovitch, they’ve concocted a womanish scandal.Our bear, too, had a finger in it, and his nephew, our Prince Charming.They’ve joined hands with the old women and, of course, they’ve concocted the affair.Would you believe it?They plotted the murder of some one! ...”"
"“谋杀某个人？”","“The murder of some one?”"
"“是的，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇，从道德上谋杀某个人。他们散布……我说的是我很熟悉的一个人。”","“Yes, Krestyan Ivanovitch, the moral murder of some one.They spread about... I’m speaking of a man I know very well.”"
"克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇点点头。","Krestyan Ivanovitch nodded."
"“他们散布关于他的谣言……我承认自己都不好意思再说了，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇。”","“They spread rumours about him... I confess I’m ashamed to repeat them, Krestyan Ivanovitch.”"
"“唔。”","“H’m.” ..."
"“他们散布谣言说，尽管他已经和另一个人订婚了，但却又和一个人签了结婚保证……你信吗，克列斯季扬．伊万诺维奇，和谁？”","“They spread a rumour that he had signed a promise to marry though he was already engaged in another quarter... and would you believe it, Krestyan Ivanovitch, to whom?”"
"“真的吗？”","“Really?”"
"“和一个做饭的，一个名声不好的德国女人。他过去常到她那里吃饭，他没有付欠下的帐，却向她求婚。”","“To a cook, to a disreputable German woman from whom he used to get his dinners; instead of paying what he owed, he offered her his hand.”"
"“这就是他们所说的？”","“Is that what they say?”"
"“你会相信吗，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇？一个下等的德国人，一个下流、不知廉耻的德国人，就是卡罗利娜·伊万诺芙娜，你要是知道……”","“Would you believe it, Krestyan Ivanovitch?A low German, a nasty shameless German, Karolina Ivanovna, if you know...”"
"“我承认，就我而言……”","“I confess, for my part...”"
"“我懂你的意思，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇，我了解，至于我，我觉得它……”","“I understand you, Krestyan Ivanovitch, I understand, and for my part I feel it...”"
"“请告诉我，你现在住在哪里？”","“Tell me, please, where are you living now?”"
"“我现在住在哪里，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇？”","“Where am I living now, Krestyan Ivanovitch?”"
"“是的……我希望……我想你过去住在……”","“Yes... I want... I believe you used to live...”"
"“是的，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇，我住在那里，过去住在那里。我确实住过！”戈利亚德金先生回答道，边说边笑，他的回答让克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇多少有些不安。","“Yes, Krestyan Ivanovitch, I did, I used to.To be sure I lived!” answered Mr. Golyadkin, accompanying his words with a little laugh, and somewhat disconcerting Krestyan Ivanovitch by his answer."
"“不，你误会我了，我的意思是说……”","“No, you misunderstood me; I meant to say...”"
"“我也想说，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇，我的本意也是这个。”戈利亚德金先生笑着继续说道，“但是我耽搁你太久了，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇。希望你允许我现在祝你早安。”","“I, too, meant to say, Krestyan Ivanovitch, I meant it too,” Mr. Golyadkin continued, laughing.“But I’ve kept you far too long, Krestyan Ivanovitch.I hope you will allow me now, to wish you good morning.”"
"“唔……”","“H’m...”"
"“真的，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇，我明白你的意思，我现在完全明白了。”我们的主人公说道，同时在克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇面前做了个有点夸张的动作，“所以，允许我祝你早安……”","“Yes, Krestyan Ivanovitch, I understand you; I fully understand you now,” said our hero, with a slight flourish before Krestyan Ivanovitch.“And so permit me to wish you good morning...”"
"这时，我们的主人公用皮靴的足尖部发出刮了刮地，走出了房间，留下克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇处于极度惊愕中。从医生家的楼梯下去时，他笑着，欢喜地搓着手。在台阶上，他呼吸着新鲜空气，觉得自己很自由，无疑准备好了承认自己是最快乐的人，还准备直接去办公室——这时，他的马车突然隆隆地驶向了门口。他瞅了一眼，想起了一切。彼特鲁斯卡已经打开车门。一种强烈而不愉快的感觉让戈利亚德金先生难以禁受。就那样，他脸红了一阵子。似乎什么东西戳了他一下。就在他伸出脚要踏上马车的踏板时，他突然转过身，朝克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇家的窗户看了看。的确，果真如此！克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇就站在窗户旁，用右手抚摸着他的胡须，好奇地盯着我们故事的主人公。","At this point our hero made a scraping with the toe of his boot and walked out of the room, leaving Krestyan Ivanovitch in the utmost amazement.As he went down the doctor’s stairs he smiled and rubbed his hands gleefully.On the steps, breathing the fresh air and feeling himself at liberty, he was certainly prepared to admit that he was the happiest of mortals, and thereupon to go straight to his office—when suddenly his carriage rumbled up to the door: he glanced at it and remembered everything.Petrushka was already opening the carriage door.Mr. Golyadkin was completely overwhelmed by a strong and unpleasant sensation.He blushed, as it were, for a moment.Something seemed to stab him.He was just about to raise his foot to the carriage step when he suddenly turned round and looked towards Krestyan Ivanovitch’s window.Yes, it was so!Krestyan Ivanovitch was standing at the window, was stroking his whiskers with his right hand and staring with some curiosity at the hero of our story."
"“那个医生是个蠢蛋，”戈利亚德金先生蜷缩在马车里看不见的地方，想着，“太蠢了。他或许能医治好他的病人，但还是……他笨的像根木头。”","“That doctor is silly,” thought Mr. Golyadkin, huddling out of sight in the carriage; “extremely silly.He may treat his patients all right, but still... he’s as stupid as a post.”"
"戈利亚德金先生坐下后，彼特鲁斯卡喊了声“走喽！”，马车又朝涅瓦大街驶去。","Mr. Golyadkin sat down, Petrushka shouted “Off!” and the carriage rolled towards Nevsky Prospect again."
"第三章","CHAPTER 3"
"那整个上午，戈利亚德金先生都是在异常的忙乱中度过的。快到涅瓦大街时，我们的主人公吩咐车夫停在集市旁。他跳出马车后，在彼特鲁斯卡的陪伴下跑进了拱廊商店街，直接去了一家出售金银制品的店铺。从他的神态就可以看出，他事务繁忙，有一大堆事要做。他计划好以一千五百卢布购买一整套餐具和茶具，经过讨价还价后，又在那个价钱中包括了一个设计独特的雪茄烟盒和一套银质剃须套装，最后，还问了其他一些独特的、既实用又讨人喜欢的物品的价格。他最后答应明天一定来，或当天就派人来取他要购买的东西。他记下了这家店铺的门牌号。店主一再要求付一小部分定金，他专心地听着，说定金会按时支付。之后，他告别了大为惊奇的店主，在一大群老伙计的跟随下，沿着拱廊商店街走着，还不停地看看彼特鲁斯卡，仔细地寻觅着新的店铺。他顺路去了一家货币兑换店，把他所有的大额钞票换成了小额的。尽管他在兑换中有所损失，但他的皮夹子鼓得相当大，这显然给了他极大的满足。最后，他在一家经营女式衣料的店铺停了下来。在这里，也决定以一大笔钱购买货品后，戈利亚德金先生又答应会再来的，并记下了商店的门牌号。被要求付定金时，他向店主保证“定金也会按时付的”。接着，他光顾了其他几家店铺，在每一家店铺都买了东西，问了各种东西的价格，有时和店主争论半天，走出店铺又三番两次地返回——事实上，他表现出了异常的活力。我们的主人公从拱廊商店街去了一家知名的家具店，他在那里预订了六个房间的家具。他很喜欢一张最新款的、时尚又特别的女用梳妆台，向店主保证他肯定会派人来取所有这些东西，然后走出了商店，照例答应会支付定金。之后，他去了别的一些地方，订购了更多的东西。总之，他不得不做的事似乎没完没了。终于，戈利亚德金先生似乎对这一切变得烦透了，他开始——天知道为什么——备受良心的折磨。比如，现在没有什么东西会诱使他去见安德雷·菲利波维奇，甚至克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇。","All that morning was spent by Mr. Golyadkin in a strange bustle of activity.On reaching the Nevsky Prospect our hero told the driver to stop at the bazaar.Skipping out of his carriage, he ran to the Arcade, accompanied by Petrushka, and went straight to a shop where gold and silver articles were for sale.One could see from his very air that he was overwhelmed with business and had a terrible amount to do.Arranging to purchase a complete dinne and tea-service for fifteen hundred roubles and including in the bargain for that sum a cigar-case of ingenious form and a silver shaving-set, and finally, asking the price of some other articles, useful and agreeable in their own way, he ended by promising to come without fail next day, or to send for his purchases the same day.He took the number of the shop, and listening attentively to the shopkeeper, who was very pressing for a small deposit, said that he should have it all in good time.After which he took leave of the amazed shopkeeper and, followed by a regular flock of shopmen, walked along the Arcade, continually looking round at Petrushka and diligently seeking our fresh shops.On the way he dropped into a money-changer’s and changed all his big notes into small ones, and though he lost on the exchange, his pocket-book was considerably fatter, which evidently afforded him extreme satisfaction.Finally, he stopped at a shop for ladies’ dress materials.Here, too, after deciding to purchase goods for a considerable sum, Mr. Golyadkin promised to come again, took the number of the shop and, on being asked for a deposit, assured the shopkeeper that “he should have a deposit too, all in good time.”Then he visited several other shops, making purchases in each of them, asked the price of various things, sometimes arguing a long time with the shopkeeper, going out of the shop and returning two or three times—in fact he displayed exceptional activity.From the Arcade our hero went to a well-known furniture shop, where he ordered furniture for six rooms; he admired a fashionable and very toilet table for ladies’ use in the latest style, and, assuring the shopkeeper that he would certainly send for all these things, walked out of the shop, as usual promising a deposit.Then he went off somewhere else and ordered something more.In short, there seemed to be no end to the business he had to get through.At last, Mr. Golyadkin seemed to grow heartily sick of it all, and he began, goodness knows why, to be tormented by the stings of conscience.Nothing would have induced him now, for instance, to meet Andrey Filippovitch, or even Krestyan Ivanovitch."
"终于，城里的大钟敲响了三点。戈利亚德金先生最后坐上马车时，似乎在那个上午所有的交易中，他实际上只买了一副手套和一瓶香水，花了一个半卢布。因为天色尚早，他吩咐车夫在涅瓦大街一家知名的餐馆附近停下来（对这家餐馆，他只是耳闻其名）。他下了马车，快步走了进去，打算随便吃点午餐，休息一下，等待晚宴的到来。","At last, the town clock struck three.When Mr. Golyadkin finally took his seat in the carriage, of all the purchases he had made that morning he had, it appeared, in reality only got a pair of gloves and a bottle of scent, that cost a rouble and a half.As it was still rather early, he ordered his coachman to stop near a well-known restaurant in Nevsky Prospect which he only knew by reputation, got out of the carriage, and hurried in to have a light lunch, to rest and to wait for the hour fixed for the dinner."
"戈利亚德金先生就像一个应邀参加豪华晚宴的人那样，午餐随便吃了点，就如常言所说的，随便吃点，填填肚子而已。他喝了一小杯伏特加，坐在扶手椅里，谦恭地环顾了一下四周，平心静气地看起了一张内容空乏的民族主义报纸。读了两三行后，他站了起来，照了照镜子，整了整衣服，抚平了头发和胡须，然后走到窗口，看看他的马车是不是还在那里……接着，他又坐到自己的座位上，拿起了报纸。很明显，我们的主人公非常激动。戈利亚德金先生瞅了一眼表，看到才三点一刻，因此还要等很长时间，同时又认为像这样坐着并不合适，就要了一杯可可茶，尽管他此时对这种东西并不是特别感兴趣。他喝了可可茶，发现时间过去了一点，就起身去结账。","Lunching as a man lunches who has the prospect before him of going out to a sumptuous dinner, that is, taking a snack of something in order to still the pangs, as they say, and drinking one small glass of vodka, Mr. Golyadkin established himself in an armchair and, modestly looking about him, peacefully settled down to an emaciated nationalist paper.After reading a couple of lines he stood up and looked in the looking-glass, set himself to rights and smoothed himself down; then he went to the window and looked to see whether his carriage was there ... then he sat down again in his place and took up the paper.It was noticeable that our hero was in great excitement.Glancing at his watch and seeing that it was only a quarter past three and that he had consequently a good time to wait and, at the same time, opining that to sit like that was unsuitable, Mr. Golyadkin ordered chocolate, though he felt no particular inclination for it at the moment.Drinking the chocolate and noticing that the time had moved on a little, he went up to pay his bill."
"他转过身，看到两位同僚站在他面前——就是那天早上在铸铁街遇到的那两位年轻人——无论从年龄还是官衔看，都是他的晚辈。我们的主人公和他们的关系既不冷也不热，既不特别友好也没有公开敌对。当然，双方都遵守着礼貌：彼此没有更亲密的言行——也不可能有。此时的相遇令戈利亚德金先生极其不愉快。他略微皱了皱眉头，霎那间觉得很窘迫。","He turned round and saw facing him two of his colleagues, the same two he had met that morning in Liteyny Street,—young men, very much his juniors both in age and rank.Our hero’s relations with them were neither one thing nor the other, neither particularly friendly nor openly hostile.Good manners were, of course, observed on both sides: there was no closer intimacy, nor could there be.The meeting at this moment was extremely distasteful to Mr. Golyadkin.He frowned a little, and was disconcerted for an instant."
"“雅科夫·彼得罗维奇，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇！”这两位登记员唧唧喳喳地说道，“您在这里？是什么风把您给吹来了？”","“Yakov Petrovitch, Yakov Petrovitch!” chirped the two register clerks; “you here?what brings you? ...”"
"“啊，是你们呀，年轻人。”戈利亚德金先生急忙打断他们。他对两个职员的大惊小怪和他们讲话的唐突觉得有点难堪和愤慨，但又觉得必须表现出一副无忧无虑、无拘无束、安逸舒适的样子。“开个小差呀，年轻人，嘿嘿嘿……”这时，为了维持尊严，对年轻人表现出高人一等的样子（他与他们从未越过一定的界限），他试图拍拍其中一个年轻人的肩膀，但这种加深交情的尝试并没有成功，不但没能成为一个无伤大雅的小玩笑，反而产生了截然不同的结果。","“Ah, it is you, gentlemen,” Mr. Golyadkin interrupted hurriedly, somewhat embarrassed and scandalized by the amazement of the clerks and by the abruptness of their address, but feeling obliged, however, to appear jaunty and free and easy.“You’ve deserted gentlemen, he-he-he...” Then, to keep up his dignity and to condescend to the juveniles, with whom he never overstepped certain limits, he attempted to slap one of the youths on the shoulder; but this effort at good fellowship did not succeed and, instead of being a well-bred little jest, produced quite a different effect."
"“嗯，我们那位狗熊还在办公室吗？”","“Well, and our bear, is he still at the office?”"
"“狗熊是谁，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇？”","“Who’s that, Yakov Petrovitch?”"
"“哎呀，就是狗熊嘛。","“Why, the bear."
"你的意思是，你们不知道谁是狗熊？”戈利亚德金先生笑道，接着转向店里的伙计，接住找给他的零钱。","Do you mean to say you don’t know whose name that is? ...” Mr. Golyadkin laughed and turned to the cashier to take his change."
"“我是指安德雷·菲利波维奇，年轻人。”他继续说着，和伙计结完了帐，这次以非常严肃的表情转向那两个职员。这两个登记员冲彼此眨了眨眼。","“I mean Andrey Filippovitch, gentlemen,” he went on, finishing with the cashier, and turning to the clerks this time with a very serious face.The two register clerks winked at one another."
"“他还在办公室，还找您来着，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇。”其中一个回答道。","“He’s still at the office and asking for you, Yakov Petrovitch,” answered one of them."
"“在办公室，嗯！那样的话，就让他呆着吧，年轻人。还找我来着，嗯？”","“At the office, eh!In that case, let him stay, gentlemen.And asking for me, eh?”"
"“他在找您，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇，但您是怎么啦，洒了香水，涂了润发油，还打扮得这么时髦？”","“He was asking for you, Yakov Petrovitch; but what’s up with you, scented, pomaded, and such a swell? ...”"
"“没什么，年轻人，没什么！够啦。”戈利亚德金先生回答道，带着不自然的笑容，看向别处。两位职员看到戈利亚德金先生在微笑，就大声笑了起来。戈利亚德金先生有点生气。","“Nothing, gentlemen, nothing!that’s enough,” answered Mr. Golyadkin, looking away with a constrained smile.Seeing that Mr. Golyadkin was smiling, the clerks laughed aloud.Mr. Golyadkin was a little offended."
"“作为朋友，我告诉你们，年轻人，”我们的主人公沉默了片刻后说道，似乎下定决心（确实如此）要向他们透漏什么事，“你们都了解我，年轻人，但到目前为止，你们了解的只是我的一方面。那不怪任何人，我认识到了，责任部分在我自己。”","“I’ll tell you as friends, gentlemen,” our hero said, after a brief silence, as though making up his mind (which, indeed, was the case) to reveal something to them.“You all know me, gentlemen, but hitherto you’ve known me only on one side.No one is to blame for that and I’m conscious that the fault has been partly my own.”"
"戈利亚德金先生撅起嘴唇，意味深长地看着那两位职员。这两个职员又冲彼此眨了眨眼。","Mr. Golyadkin pursed his lips and looked significantly at the clerks.The clerks winked at one another again."
"“到目前为止，年轻人，你们还不了解我。此时此地把我的意思解释清楚并不合适。我只是顺便稍微提一下。年轻人，有的人不喜欢拐弯抹角的方式，而且只在化妆舞会上才戴面具。有的人不认为用靴子擦亮地板是人类的最高职业。年轻人，有的人，比如说他们穿了合身的裤子，却拒绝说他们因此很高兴，生活很充实。最后，还有的人不喜欢漫无目的地跳来转去，讨好巴结，拍马屁，尤其是，年轻人，不喜欢瞎管人家不希望他管的闲事……我已经把几乎所有的一切都告诉你们了，年轻人，现在请允许我告退……”","“Hitherto, gentlemen, you have not known me.To explain myself here and now would not be appropriate.I will only touch on it lightly in passing.There are people, gentlemen, who dislike roundabout ways and only mask themselves at masquerades.There are people who do not see man’s highest avocation in polishing the floor with their boots.There are people, gentlemen, who refuse to say that they are happy and enjoying a full life when, for instance, their trousers set properly.There are people, finally, who dislike dashing and whirling about for no object, fawning, and licking the dust, and above all, gentlemen, poking their noses where they are not wanted...I’ve told you almost everything, gentlemen; now allow me to withdraw...”"
"戈利亚德金先生停了下来。由于这两个登记员现在已经得到了他们想要的一切，俩人突然粗鲁地放声大笑起来。戈利亚德金先生突然发怒了。","Mr. Golyadkin paused.As the register clerks had now got all that they wanted, both of them with great incivility burst into shouts of laughter.Mr. Golyadkin flared up."
"“笑吧，年轻人，暂且笑吧！如果你们活得够久的话，就会明白的。”他说道，感觉尊严受到了冒犯，拿起帽子，退向了门口。","“Laugh away, gentlemen, laugh away for the time being!If you live long enough you will see,” he said, with a feeling of offended dignity, taking his hat and retreating to the door."
"“但我还要再多说点，年轻人，”他补充道，最后一次转向这两个登记员，“我再多说点——你们俩在这里和我面对面。年轻人，这是我惯常的做法：败不馁，胜不骄，而且在任何情况下，我从不阴险狡诈。我不是个搞阴谋诡计的人，并且我引以为豪。我从不对自己的外交手腕感到得意。有人还说，年轻人，飞禽会自己朝猎人飞去。的确，我愿意承认这种说法。但在这种情况下，谁是猎人，谁是飞禽呢？这仍是个问题，年轻人！”","“But I will say more, gentlemen,” he added, turning for the last time to the register clerks, “I will say more—you are both here with me face to face.This, gentlemen, is my rule: if I fail I don’t lose heart, if I succeed I persevere, and in any case I am never underhand.I’m not one to intrigue—and I’m proud of it.I’ve never prided myself on diplomacy.They say, too, gentlemen, that the bird flies itself to the hunter.It’s true and I’m ready to admit it; but who’s the hunter, and who’s the bird in this case?That is still the question, gentlemen!”"
"戈利亚德金先生陷入了无声胜有声的沉默中，摆出一副别有用意的神态，也就是撅起嘴唇，尽可能高地竖起眉毛。他向这两个职员鞠了个躬，走了出去，留下他们处于无比惊愕之中。","Mr. Golyadkin subsided into eloquent silence, and, with a most significant air, that is, pursing up his lips and raising his eyebrows as high as possible, he bowed to the clerks and walked out, leaving them in the utmost amazement."
"“现在有什么吩咐？”彼特鲁斯卡问道，态度相当生硬。他大概厌倦了在寒风中闲逛。“有什么吩咐？”他问戈利亚德金先生，然而遇到的是令人不快、使人难堪的目光。我们的主人公那天上午已经用这种目光保护过自己两次了，现在是他在下台阶时，第三次求助于这种手段。","“What are your orders now?”Petrushka asked, rather gruffly; he was probably weary of hanging about in the cold.“What are your orders?” he asked Mr. Golyadkin, meeting the terrible, withering glance with which our hero had protected himself twice already that morning, and to which he had recourse now for the third time as he came down the steps."
"“去伊兹梅洛夫桥。”","“To Ismailovsky Bridge.”"
"“去伊兹梅洛夫桥！走喽！”","“To Ismailovsky Bridge! Off!”"
"“他们的晚宴过了四点才开始，或者可能是五点钟。”戈利亚德金先生想，“现在不是还早吗？不过，我可以稍微早点去。再说，它只是一个家庭晚宴。这样我可以随便点，正如有修养的人说的那样。我为什么就不能随便点呢？那个狗熊也告诉我们，一切都会很随便的，所以我一样可以……”戈利亚德金先生这样想着。可与此同时，他却越来越激动了。可以看得出来，他正准备去干一件重大的事，但别的就不知道了。他喃喃自语，用右手做着手势，不停地朝车窗外张望着，因此，看着戈利亚德金先生，没人会说他正要去赴一顿美宴，而仅仅是在他自家人圈子里的一顿普通晚宴——很随便，正如在有教养的人中说的那样。最后，就在伊兹梅洛夫桥头，戈利亚德金先生指向一幢大房子。马车轰隆隆地驶向那里，在右边第一个入口旁停了下来。戈利亚德金先生看到在二楼的窗口旁有个女人的身影，就用手给了她个飞吻。不过，他根本不知道自己在做什么，因为他当时觉得半死不活的。他从马车上下来，脸色苍白，心烦意乱。他登上台阶，脱掉帽子，机械地整了整衣服，虽然觉得膝盖有点发抖，但还是上了楼。","“Their dinner will not begin till after four, or perhaps five o’clock,” thought Mr. Golyadkin; “isn’t it early now?However, I can go a little early; besides, it’s only a family dinner.And so I can go sans facons, as they say among well-bred people.Why shouldn’t I go sans facons?The bear told us, too, that it would all be sans facons, and so I will be the same...”Such were Mr. Golyadkin’s reflections and meanwhile his excitement grew more and more acute.It could be seen that he was preparing himself for some great enterprise, to say nothing more; he muttered to himself, gesticulated with his right hand, continually looked out of his carriage window, so that, looking at Mr. Golyadkin, no one would have said that he was on his way to a good dinner, and only a simple dinner in his family circle—sans facons, as they say among well-bred people.Finally, just at Ismailovsky Bridge, Mr. Golyadkin pointed out a house; and the carriage rolled up noisily and stopped at the first entrance on the right.Noticing a feminine figure at the second storey window, Mr. Golyadkin kissed his hand to her.He had, however, not the slightest idea what he was doing, for he felt more dead than alive at the moment.He got out of the carriage pale, distracted; he mounted the steps, took off his hat, mechanically straightened himself, and though he felt a slight trembling in his knees, he went upstairs."
"“奥尔苏菲·伊万诺维奇呢？”他向开门的人询问道。","“Olsufy Ivanovitch?” he inquired of the man who opened the door."
"“在家，先生，反正他不在家，老爷不在家。”","“At home, sir; at least he’s not at home, his honour’s not at home.”"
"“什么？你什么意思呀，亲爱的？我——我是来参加晚宴的，伙计。哎呀，你认识我的呀？”","“What?What do you mean, my good man?I—I’ve come to dinner, brother.Why, you know me?”"
"“我当然认识您啦！上面吩咐不让接待您啊。”","“To be sure I know you!I’ve orders not to admit you.”"
"“你……你，伙计……你一定是弄错了。是我啊，伙计，我受到了邀请，我是来参加晚宴的。”戈利亚德金先生说道，脱掉大衣，很明显地表示打算进屋了。","“You... you, brother... you must be making a mistake.It’s I, my boy, I’m invited; I’ve come to dinner,” Mr. Golyadkin announced, taking off his coat and displaying unmistakable intentions of going into the room."
"“原谅我，先生，你不能，先生。上面吩咐我不要接待您。上面吩咐我回绝您。就是这样的。”","“Allow me, sir, you can’t, sir.I’ve orders not to admit you.I’ve orders to refuse you.That’s how it is.”"
"戈利亚德金先生脸色变得苍白。就在这时，里屋的门开了，奥尔苏菲·伊万诺维奇的老跟班格拉西梅奇出来了。","Mr. Golyadkin turned pale.At that very moment the door of the inner room opened and Gerasimitch, Olsufy Ivanovitch’s old butler, came out."
"“你看，这位先生想要进去，叶梅利扬·格拉西梅奇，而我……”","“You see, the gentlemen wants to go in, Emelyan Gerasimitch, and I...”"
"“你个笨蛋，阿列克谢伊奇。进去，叫那个混帐谢苗诺维奇到这里来。这不行啊。”他礼貌而又坚决地对戈利亚德金先生说，“这绝对不行。老爷请您见谅，他没法接待您。”","“And you’re a fool, Alexeitch.Go inside and send the rascal Semyonovitch here.It’s impossible,” he said politely but firmly, addressing Mr. Golyadkin.“It’s quite impossible.His honour begs you to excuse him; he can’t see you.”"
"“他说他不能接待我？”戈利亚德金先生迟疑地问道。“请问，格拉西梅奇，为什么不行啊？”","“He said he couldn’t see me?”Mr. Golyadkin asked uncertainly.“Excuse me, Gerasimitch, why is it impossible?”"
"“确实不行。我已经通告了老爷，他们说‘请您见谅。’他们不能接待您。”","“It’s quite impossible.I’ve informed your honour; they said ‘Ask him to excuse us.’They can’t see you.”"
"“为什么不行呀？这是怎么回事呀？嗨。”","“Why not?How’s that?Why.”"
"“对不起，对不起！”","“Allow me, allow me! ...”"
"“可这究竟是怎么回事呀？不可能的呀！去通报一声……这怎么回事呀？我是来参加晚宴的……”","“How is it though?It’s out of the question!Announce me... How is it?I’ve come to dinner...”"
"“对不起，对不起……”","“Excuse me, excuse me...”"
"“啊，好吧，既然他们请求原谅，那就是另外一回事了。但是，原谅我，格拉西梅奇，这是怎么回事嘛，格拉西梅奇？”","“Ah, well, that’s a different matter, they asked to be excused; but, allow me, Gerasimitch; how is it, Gerasimitch?”"
"“对不起，对不起！”格拉西梅奇回复道。他非常坚决地把戈利亚德金先生的手推开，给当时走到门厅的两位先生让路。刚说的那两位先生是安德雷·菲利波维奇和他的外甥拉基米尔·谢苗诺维奇。他们俩都惊奇地看着戈利亚德金先生。安德雷·菲利波维奇似乎要说什么，可现在戈利亚德金先生已经下定决心，他现在走出了奥尔苏菲·伊万诺维奇家的门厅，红着脸，微笑着，低着眼睛，带着一副无助的迷茫的面容。“以后我再来，格拉西梅奇，我会自己解释的，我希望这一切会毫不拖延地在适当的时候得到说明……”","“Excuse me, excuse me!”replied Gerasimitch, very firmly putting away Mr. Golyadkin’s hand and making way for two gentlemen who walked into the entry that very instant.The gentlemen in question were Andrey Filippovitch and his nephew Vladimir Semyonovitch.Both of the looked with amazement at Mr. Golyadkin.Andrey Filippovitch seemed about to say something, but Mr. Golyadkin had by now made up his mind: he was by now walking out of Olsufy Ivanovitch’s entry, blushing and smiling, with eyes cast down and a countenance of helpless bewilderment.“I will come afterwards, Gerasimitch; I will explain myself: I hope that all this will without delay be explained in due season...”"
"“雅科夫·彼得罗维奇，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇……”他听到了紧跟在他后面的安德雷·菲利波维奇的声音。","“Yakov Petrovitch, Yakov Petrovitch...” He heard the voice of Andrey Filippovitch following him."
"戈利亚德金先生此时正在楼梯的第一个平台上。他快速地转向安德雷·菲利波维奇。","Mr. Golyadkin was by that time on the first landing.He turned quickly to Andrey Filippovitch."
"“你想做什么，安德雷·菲利波维奇？”他说道，语气相当坚决。","“What do you desire, Andrey Filippovitch?” he said in a rather resolute voice."
"“你怎么啦，雅科夫·菲利波维奇？究竟怎样啦？”","“What’s wrong with you, Yakov Petrovitch?In what way?”"
"“没什么，安德雷·菲利波维奇。是我自己来这里的。这是我的私生活，安德雷·菲利波维奇。”","“No matter, Andrey Filippovitch.I’m on my own account here.This is my private life, Andrey Filippovitch.”"
"“什么？”","“What’s that?”"
"“我说，安德雷·菲利波维奇，至于我在这里，这是我的私生活；在我看来，关于我的公务关系，是找不到任何可以指责的地方的。”","“I say, Andrey Filippovitch, that this is my private life, and as for my being here, as far as I can see, there’s nothing reprehensible to be found in it as regards my official relations.”"
"“什么！关于你的公务……你是怎么啦，亲爱的先生？”","“What!As regards your official... What’s the matter with you, my good sir?”"
"“没什么，安德雷·菲利波维奇，真的没什么，一个莽撞的丫头片子，再没别的了……”","“Nothing, Andrey Filippovitch, absolutely nothing; an impudent slut of a girl, and nothing more...”"
"“什么！什么？”安德雷·菲利波维奇惊愕得茫然不知所措。戈利亚德金先生到此时为止，看起来好像要扑到安德雷·菲利波维奇的脸上似的，看到科长露出一点笑容，几乎下意识地向前迈了一步。安德雷·菲利波维奇猛地向后一退。戈利亚德金先生上了一级台阶，接着又上了一级。安德雷·菲利波维奇忐忑不安地朝四周看了看。戈利亚德金先生快速地登上了楼梯。安德雷·菲利波维奇则更加快速地冲进屋里，砰地关上了身后的门，留下了戈利亚德金先生一个人。他眼前一阵发黑。他彻底困惑了，现在站在那里，漫无目的地迟疑着，似乎在回想不久前才发生的一些也是极其没有意义的事。“唉，唉！”他低声咕哝道，不自然地笑着。这时，楼梯上传来了脚步声和说话声，大概来自奥尔苏菲·伊万诺维奇邀请的其他客人。戈利亚德金先生多少清醒了些，竖起自己的浣熊毛皮衣领，尽可能地把自己遮住，开始快速地迈着碎步，跌跌撞撞、踉踉跄跄地匆忙下楼了。他觉得有点虚弱，有点麻木。他是如此困顿，以致于出来到台阶上时，竟没等他的马车来就穿过泥泞的庭院，向它走去了。戈利亚德金先生到达马车旁，正准备上车时，内心生发出一种欲望，恨不得同他的马车一起钻进泥土里，或躲到老鼠洞里。他觉得奥尔苏菲·伊万诺维奇家里的一切此刻都从各个窗口望着他。他知道，如果返回的话，他肯定会当场死掉的。","“What!What?”Andrey Filippovitch was stupefied with amazement.Mr. Golyadkin, who had up till then looked as though he would fly into Andrey Filippovitch’s face, seeing that the head of his office was laughing a little, almost unconsciously took a step forward.Andrey Filippovitch jumped back.Mr. Golyadkin went up one step and then another.Andrey Filippovitch looked about him uneasily.Mr. Golyadkin mounted the stairs rapidly.Still more rapidly Andrey Filippovitch darted into the flat and slammed the door after him.Mr. Golyadkin was left alone.Everything grew dark before his eyes.He was utterly nonplussed, and stood now in a sort of senseless hesitation, as though recalling something extremely senseless, too, that had happened quite recently.“Ech, ech!” he muttered, smiling with constraint.Meanwhile, there came the sounds of steps and voices on the stairs, probably of other guests invited by Olsufy Ivanovitch.Mr. Golyadkin recovered himself to some extent; put up his racoon collar, concealing himself behind it as far as possible, and began going downstairs with rapid little steps, tripping and stumbling in his haste.He felt overcome by a sort of weakness and numbness.His confusion was such that, when he came out on the steps, he did not even wait for his carriage but walked across the muddy court to it.When he reached his carriage and was about to get into it, Mr. Golyadkin inwardly uttered a desire to sink into the earth, or to hide in a mouse hole together with his carriage.It seemed to him that everything in Olsufy Ivanovitch’s house was looking at him now out of every window.He knew that he would certainly die on the spot if he were to go back."
"“你在笑什么呢，傻瓜？”他低声而快速地对正准备扶他上车的彼得鲁什卡说。","“What are you laughing at, blockhead?” he said in a rapid mutter to Petrushka, who was preparing to help him into the carriage."
"“我有什么好笑的？我没有笑。现在我们去哪里？”","“What should I laugh at?I’m not doing anything; where are we to drive to now?”"
"“回家，走吧……”","“Go home, drive on...”"
"“回家，走喽！”彼特鲁斯卡喊道，爬上了踏脚板。","“Home, off!” shouted Petrushka, climbing on to the footboard."
"“真像只乌鸦在叫！”戈利亚德金先生想。这时，马车已经驶过伊兹梅洛夫桥很远了。突然，我们的主人公用尽全力拽了一下绳子，叫车夫立刻返回。车夫掉转马头，两分钟内便又驶回了奥尔苏菲·伊万诺维奇家的庭院里。","“What a crow’s croak!” thought Mr. Golyadkin.Meanwhile, the carriage had driven a good distance from Ismailovsky Bridge.Suddenly our hero pulled the cord with all his might and shouted to the driver to turn back at once.The coachman turned his horses and within two minutes was driving into Olsufy Ivanovitch’s yard again."
"“别，别，傻瓜，回去！”戈利亚德金先生喊道。车夫好像在期待这个吩咐似的，他没作任何回复，没有在入口停，而是在庭院里绕了个圈，又驶到了大街上。","“Don’t, don’t, you fool, back!” shouted Mr. Golyadkin—and, as though he were expecting this order, the driver made no reply but, without stopping at the entrance, drove all round the courtyard and out into the street again."
"戈利亚德金先生没有回家，而是在过了谢苗诺夫桥后，吩咐车夫返回到一个小巷，在一家看上去相当简朴的餐馆旁停了下来。我们的主人公下了马车，和车夫结了帐，最后就这样辞退了马车。他告诉彼特鲁斯卡回家去等他，而自己进了餐馆，要了一间包房，点了饭菜。他觉得很不舒服，大脑极度混乱。他焦虑不安地在房间里走来走去，走了很久，最后坐到椅子上，用手支着额头，开始竭力思考并解决与自己目前处境有关的一些事。","Mr. Golyadkin did not drive home, but, after passing the Semyonovsky Bridge, told the driver to return to a side street and stop near a restaurant of rather modest appearance.Getting out of the carriage, our hero settled up with the driver and so got rid of his equipage at last.He told Petrushka to go home and await his return, while he went into the restaurant, took a private room and ordered dinner.He felt very ill and his brain was in the utmost confusion and chaos.For a long time he walked up and down the room in agitation; at last he sat down in a chair, propped his brow in his hands and began doing his very utmost to consider and settle something relating to his present position."
"第四章","CHAPTER 4"
"五品文官贝伦捷耶夫曾经是戈利亚德金先生的恩人和资助者，他的独生女儿克拉拉·奥尔苏菲耶芙娜生日那天举办了一个风光而又豪华的宴会，这样的宴会在伊兹梅洛夫桥附近的公寓里已经很久没有看到了。这个宴会更像是某个伯沙撒王的盛筵，就其风光、奢侈和气派而言，颇具巴比伦王国的遗风。宴会上有凯歌香槟，有来自叶利谢耶夫和米柳京店铺里的牡蛎和水果，有各种体肥脑笨的贵族和各级政府官员。这一盛大的节日最后还有一个豪华的舞会，一个小型的生日舞会，但就其品味、规格与气派而言，仍然十分豪华。当然，我愿意承认类似的舞会有时也有，尽管很少。这样的舞会，更像是家庭欢庆而不是一般的舞会，只有在像五品文官贝伦捷耶夫这样的人家里才办得出。我再多说一点：我甚至怀疑是否所有的五品官员家里都能办得出这样的舞会。噢，如果我是个诗人就好了！我说的自然是像荷马或普希金那类的。没有甚多的才能，人们是不会冒险的——噢，我的读者们，无疑，我本该用自由的笔墨和浓重的色彩来为你们描绘这整个辉煌的一天的！是的，我应该以宴会开始我的诗篇，我应该着力渲染首次举杯祝贺生日女王的那一引人注目而又隆重的时刻。我应该为你们描绘一下客人们，他们沉浸在恭敬的沉默与期待中，如狄摩西尼的辞令那般雄辩。接着，我应该为你们描写一下安德雷·菲利波维奇，作为宾客中的长者，他具有某种优先权。他头发花白，还戴着与他的白发相称的勋章。他从座位上站起来，举起盛有冒着气泡的香槟酒的祝贺的酒杯，高过头顶——这酒是为庆祝这样的时刻，从一个遥远的王国运来的，更像是天国里众神饮的酒，而不是普通的酒。我会为你们描绘客人们和那对幸福的父母，他们在安德雷·菲利波维奇之后，也举起酒杯，并用满怀期待的目光注视着他。我会为你们描述经常提起的这位安德雷·菲利波维奇，他的一滴眼泪掉进了酒杯，他致了贺词和祝愿，提议祝酒，为官员女儿的健康干杯……但是，我承认，我坦率地承认，我无法恰如其分地把这一隆重的时刻描绘出来，当时生日女王克拉拉·奥尔苏菲耶芙娜羞得满脸通红，像春天里的玫瑰一样，面部泛着幸福和谦虚的红晕，她无法抑制自己的感情，倒在了慈母的怀里。那位温柔的母亲流着眼泪。还有父亲奥尔苏菲·伊万诺维奇，他是位精神矍铄的老人，五品文官，在长年的工作中双腿失去了功能，而命运因他的尽忠职守，赏赐了他资产、一座房子、一些小的地产和一个漂亮的女儿，他像孩子似的哭泣着，噙着眼泪宣布说阁下大人是个乐善好施的人。我无法，我真的无法描写出紧接在那一刻之后每个人心中的那种热忱，这种热忱在一个年轻的登记员的行为中明显地表现了出来（尽管在那一刻，他更像是个五品官员，而不是个登记员）。他听着安德雷·菲利波维奇的话，也感动得流下了眼泪。说到安德雷·菲利波维奇，他在那一庄重的时刻也不像是个六品文官兼某部门的办事处主管——真的，他像别的什么……究竟到底是什么，我不知道，但不是个六品文官。他的地位显得更高！最后……噢，为什么我没有掌握崇高有力的语言的秘密，庄严的文体的秘密，来描写人生中这些重大的、富有教益的时刻呢，这些时刻似乎是明确地创设出来证明美德有时是会战胜忘恩负义、自由思想、恶习以及妒忌的！我不会说什么，而默默地——这比任何雄辩都强——我会指出那个刚刚步入他的第二十六个春天的幸运青年——安德雷·菲利波维奇的外甥费拉基米尔·谢苗诺维奇。他这时也从座位上站起来，也提议干杯，注视着他的是生日女王父母那满含泪水的眼睛、安德雷·菲利波维奇那骄傲的目光、生日女王那谦逊的目光、客人们那严肃的目光，还有这个青年的几位年轻同僚那礼貌却忌妒的目光。我不想再说什么了，虽然我不能不注意到，那个年轻人身上的一切——从恭维的意义上讲，的确，他更像是位长者，而不是个年轻人——从他充满红润光泽的脸颊到他八品文官的头衔，这一切仿佛几乎都在大声宣告着一个人通过道德和美好品德可以达到的崇高的巅峰！我就不描述安东·安东诺维奇·谢托奇金了，这位鹤发童颜的老人是某部门的首席办事员，是安德雷·菲利波维奇的同僚，过去也曾是奥尔苏菲耶芙娜·伊万诺维奇的同僚，又是这家的故友，克拉拉·奥尔苏菲耶芙娜的教父。他也提议干杯，像公鸡一样叫了一声，讲了许多小笑话。他极其恰当地违反礼节——如果可以这样说的话——把所有人都逗笑了，直到笑出了眼泪。还有克拉拉·奥尔苏菲耶芙娜，她在父母的吩咐下，为他的诙谐幽默和彬彬有礼而亲吻了他。我只说说，客人们在这样的筵席之后一定感到彼此亲如兄弟，他们最后离席站了起来。年长者和更加稳重的宾客花短暂的时间做了友好的交谈，甚至说了几句坦率，不过，当然，很礼貌和得体的话，然后礼貌地进入了另一个房间。他们没有浪费宝贵的时光，立即分成了几组，带着一种富有自我尊严的表情，在蒙着绿呢的桌子旁坐了下来。同时，在客厅里就座的女士们则突然变得非常客气，开始谈论各种衣料。那位德高望重的主人，就是在忠心供职于公职时丧失了双腿的功能，之后得到了我们上面列举的所有恩赐的那位主人，拄着拐杖，在弗拉基米尔·谢苗诺维奇和克拉拉·奥尔苏菲耶芙娜的搀扶下，开始在客人中走来走去。他也突然变得非常和蔼，决定不惜花费，临时安排一个朴实的小型舞会，为此还差遣一位动作敏捷的年轻人（就是那个看起来更像是个五品官员，而不是个青年的人）去找来了乐队。乐队有十一个人，准时在八点半奏响了法国卡德里尔舞诱人的乐曲，接着是其他各种舞曲……不用说，我的笔太弱、太钝、太无力了，因而无法描绘因为这位白发苍苍的主人的热情好客而诞生的舞会。我请问，怎么能由一位才疏学浅的记录者来描述戈利亚德金先生那具有其特有的方式而又非常有趣的奇遇呢？我怎么能描绘出齐集优美、风光、气派、欢乐、客气稳重又稳重礼貌、嬉戏、高兴于一体的非凡罕见的和谐场面呢？怎么能描绘出这些官太太和小姐们所有的欢笑和嬉戏呢？她们更像是仙女，而不是一般的女士——从恭维的意义上讲——有着百合般的肩膀和玫瑰般的脸颊，有着飘逸的身材，有着顽皮灵活、娇小玲珑的——用高雅的话来说——纤足。最后，我怎样才能向你们描绘出这些殷勤的官员，她们的舞伴呢？他们是欢乐而稳重的年轻人，沉稳的、欣喜的、茫然但不失礼貌。舞间休息时间在隔壁小绿屋里抽烟的，或在舞间休息不抽烟的，每个人都有非常体面的姓氏和官衔——他们都富有优雅感和自尊，几乎所有人都对他们的舞伴讲法语，或者即使是俄语，也只使用最有教养的表达方式、恭维话和深奥的论述，而且只在吸烟室里才允许自己无伤大雅地偏离这一高雅的语言，说一些热情友好的简短的话语，比如说，像“彼季卡，你个浪货，你的波尔卡舞跳得太棒了”，或者，“我说，瓦夏，你个无赖，你对你的舞伴也太随便了吧。”噢，我的读者，对于这一切，正如我已经在前面有幸解释过的那样，我的笔负了我，因此我略而不谈。我们还是回到戈利亚德金先生，这位我非常真实的故事里真正的、唯一的主人公。","That day the birthday of Klara Olsufyevna, the only daughter of the civil councillor, Berendyev, at one time Mr. Golyadkin’s benefactor and patron, was being celebrated by a brilliant and sumptuous dinner-party, such as had not been seen for many a long day within the walls of the flats in the neighbourhood of Ismailovsky Bridge—a dinner more like some Balthazar’s feast, with a suggestion of something Babylonian in its brilliant luxury and style, with Veuve-Clicquot champagne, with oysters and fruit from Eliseyev’s and Milyutin’s, with all sorts of fatted calves, and all grades of the government service.This festive day was to conclude with a brilliant ball, a small birthday ball, but yet brilliant in its taste, its distinction and its style.Of course, I am willing to admit that similar balls do happen sometimes, though rarely.Such balls, more like family rejoicings than balls, can only be given in such houses as that of the civil councillor, Berendyev.I will say more: I even doubt if such balls could be given in the houses of all civil councillors.Oh, if I were a poet!Such as Homer or Pushkin, I mean, of course; with any lesser talent one would not venture—I should certainly have painted all that glorious day for you, oh, my readers, with a free brush and brilliant colours!Yes, I should begin my poem with my dinner, I should lay special stress on that striking and solemn moment when the first goblet was raised to the honour of the queen of the fete.I should describe to you the guests plunged in a reverent silence and expectation, as eloquent as the rhetoric of Demosthenes; I should describe for you, then, how Andrey Filippovitch, having as the eldest of the guests some right to take precedence, adorned with his grey hairs and the orders that well befit grey hairs, got up from his seat and raised above his head the congratulatory glass of sparkling wine—brought from a distant kingdom to celebrate such occasions and more like heavenly nectar than plain wine.I would portray for you the guests and the happy parents raising their glasses, too, after Andrey Filippovitch, and fastening upon him eyes full of expectation.I would describe for you how the same Andrey Filippovitch, so often mentioned, after dropping a tear in his glass, delivered his congratulations and good wishes, proposed the toast and drank the health... but I confess, I freely confess, that I could not do justice to the solemn moment when the queen of the fete, Klara Olsufyevna, blushing like a rose in spring, with the glow of bliss and of modesty, was so overcome by her feelings that she sank into the arms of her tender mamma; how that tender mamma shed tears, and how the father, Olsufy Ivanovitch, a hale old man and a privy councillor, who had lost the use of his legs in his long years of service and been rewarded by destiny for his devotion with investments, a house, some small estates, and a beautiful daughter, sobbed like a little child and announced through his tears that his Excellency was a benevolent man.I could not, I positively could not, describe the enthusiasm that followed that moment in every heart, an enthusiasm clearly evinced in the conduct of a youthful register clerk (though at that moment he was more like a civil councillor than a register clerk), who was moved to tears, too, as he listened to Andrey Filippovitch.In his turn, too, Andrey Filippovitch was in that solemn moment quite unlike a collegiate councillor and the head of an office in the department—yes, he was something else ... what, exactly, I do not know, but not a collegiate councillor.He was more exalted!Finally... Oh, why do I not possess the secret of lofty, powerful language, of the sublime style, to describe these grand and edifying moments of human life, which seem created expressly to prove that virtue sometimes triumphs over ingratitude, free-thinking, vice and envy!I will say nothing, but in silence—which will be better than any eloquence—I will point to that fortunate youth, just entering on his twenty-sixth spring—to Vladimir Semyonovitch, Andrey Filippovitch’s nephew, who in his turn now rose from his seat, who in his turn proposed a toast, and upon whom were fastened the tearful eyes of the parents, the proud eyes of Andrey Filippovitch, the modest eyes of the queen of the fete, the solemn eyes of the guests and even the decorously envious eyes of some of the young man’s youthful colleagues.I will say nothing of that, though I cannot refrain from observing that everything in that young man—who was, indeed, speaking in a complimentary sense, more like an elderly than a young man—everything, from his blooming cheeks to his assessorial rank seemed almost to proclaim aloud the lofty pinnacle a man can attain through morality and good principles!I will not describe how Anton Antonovitch Syetotochkin, a little old man as grey as a badger, the head clerk of a department, who was a colleague of Andrey Filippovitch’s and had once been also of Olsufy Ivanovitch’s, and was an old friend of the family and Klara Olsufyevna’s godfather, in his turn proposed a toast, crowed like a cock, and cracked many little jokes; how by this extremely proper breach of propriety, if one may use such an expression, he made the whole company laugh till they cried, and how Klara Olsufyevna, at her parents’ bidding, rewarded him for his jocularity and politeness with a kiss.I will only say that the guests, who must have felt like kinsfolk and brothers after such a dinner, at last rose from the table, and the elderly and more solid guests, after a brief interval spent in friendly conversation, interspersed with some candid, though, of course, very polite and proper observations, went decorously into the next room and, without losing valuable time, promptly divided themselves up into parties and, full of the sense of their own dignity, installed themselves at tables covered with green baize.Meanwhile, the ladies established in the drawing-room suddenly became very affable and began talking about dress-materials.And the venerable host, who had lost the use of his legs in the service of loyalty and religion, and had been rewarded with all the blessings we have enumerated above, began walking about on crutches among his guests, supported by Vladimir Semyonovitch and Klara Olsufyevna, and he, too, suddenly becoming extremely affable, decided to improvise a modest little dance, regardless of expense; to that end a nimble youth (the one who was more like a civil councillor than a youth) was despatched to fetch musicians, and musicians to the number of eleven arrived, and exactly at half-past eight struck up the inviting strains of a French quadrille, followed by various other dances...It is needless to say that my pen is too weak, dull, and spiritless to describe the dance that owed its inspiration to the genial hospitality of the grey-headed host.And how, I ask, can the modest chronicler of Mr. Golyadkin’s adventures, extremely interesting as they are in their own way, how can I depict the choice and rare mingling of beauty, brilliance, style, gaiety, polite solidity and solid politeness, sportiveness, joy, all the mirth and playfulness of these wives and daughters of petty officials, more like fairies than ladies—in a complimentary sense—with their lily shoulders and their rosy faces, their ethereal figures, their playfully agile homeopathic—to use the exalted language appropriate — little feet?How can I describe to you, finally, the gallant officials, their partners—gay and solid youths, steady, gleeful, decorously vague, smoking a pipe in the intervals between the dancing in a little green room apart, or not smoking a pipe in the intervals between the dances, every one of them with a highly respectable surname and rank in the service—all steeped in a sense of the elegant and a sense of their own dignity; almost all speaking French to their partners, or if Russian, using only the most well-bred expressions, compliments and profound observations, and only in the smoking-room permitting themselves some genial lapses from this high tone, some phrases of cordial and friendly brevity, such, for instance, as: “’Pon my soul, Petka, you rake, you did kick me off that polka in style,” or, “I say, Vasya, you dog, you did give your partner a time of it.”For all this, as I’ve already had the honour of explaining, oh, my readers!my pen fails me, and therefore I am dumb.Let us rather return to Mr. Golyadkin, the true and only hero of my very truthful tale."
"事实就是，他发现自己现在正处于一种很奇怪的境地，至少可以这么说。各位，他也在这里——换句话说，不在舞会上，但也差不多在舞会上。他“尽管不要紧，他能自己照顾自己”，然而在那一刻，他有点走错方向了。他当时正站在——说来也怪——通往奥尔苏菲·伊万诺维奇的寓所的后楼梯的平台上。但是，他站在那里也“没什么”，他“很好”。他站在一个角落里，缩在一个不是很暖和，不过比较黑暗的地方，被各种各样的垃圾、杂物和零碎东西中的一个大衣柜和旧屏风半遮挡着。他暂且隐藏着，以旁观者的身份关注着事情的进展。他现在只是在观察，各位。各位，他当然也可以进去……为什么他不该进去呢？他只要迈一步就能进去了，而且能很利落地进去。现在，尽管他已经在那各种各样的垃圾、杂物和零碎东西中的衣柜和屏风之间站了将近三个小时了，但为了自我辩解，他只引用了法国部长维雷尔一句值得记忆的警句：“只要耐心等待，一切迟早会来的。”戈利亚德金先生以前在某本题材完全不同的书上看到了这个句子，而现在却很恰当地想起了它。这个警句，首先，极其符合他目前的处境。而且，的确，为何它就不能出现在一个在寒冷和黑暗中等待了将近三个小时、期待自己的奇遇能有个圆满结局的人的脑海里呢？戈利亚德金先生非常恰当地引用了法国部长维雷尔的警句后，立刻想起了土耳其大臣马尔齐米里斯，以及美丽的边疆侯爵夫人露易丝，他们的故事也是他以前在某本书里看到的。接着，他的脑海里闪现出了耶稣会会士的常规：只要能够达到目的，就可以不择手段。戈利亚德金先生用这个史实多少让自己安心一些后，自言自语道，耶稣会会士怎么啦？耶稣会会士每个人都是大笨蛋，他比他们任何一个都优秀。只要那个餐具间有一分钟没人（这个餐具间的门直对着通往后楼梯的过道，戈利亚德金先生现在正躲在那里），他就不管世界上所有的耶稣会会士，直接进去了，先从餐具间到茶水间，再到他们现在正打牌的房间，之后直接到现在人们正跳波尔卡舞的大厅。他会进去的——他会溜进去的——而且就这样，没人会注意到他。而一旦到了那里，他就知道该做什么了。","The fact is that he found himself now in a very strange position, to the least of it.He was here also, gentlemen—that is, not at the dance, but almost at the dance; he was “all right, though; he could take care of himself,” yet at that moment he was a little astray; he was standing at that moment , strange to say—on the landing of the back stairs to Olsufy Ivanovitch’s flat.But it was “all right” his standing there; he was “quite well.”He was standing in a corner, huddled in a place which was not very warm, though it was dark, partly hidden by a huge cupboard and an old screen, in the midst of rubbish, litter, and odds and ends of all sorts, concealing himself for the time being and watching the course of proceedings as a disinterested spectator.He was only looking on now, gentlemen; he, too, gentlemen, might go in, of course ... why should he not go in?He had only to take one step and he would go in, and would go in very adroitly.Just now, though he had been standing nearly three hours between the cupboard and the screen in the midst of the rubbish, litter and odds and ends of all sorts, he was only quoting, in his own justification, a memorable phrase of the French minister, Villesle: “All things come in time to him who has the strength to wait.”Mr. Golyadkin had read this sentence in some book on quite a different subject, but now very aptly recalled it.The phrase, to begin with, was exceedingly appropriate to his present position, and, indeed, why should it not occur to the mind of a man who had been waiting for almost three hours in the cold and the dark in expectation of a happy ending to his adventures.After quoting very appropriately the phrase of the French minister, Villesle, Mr. Golyadkin immediately thought of the Turkish Vizier, Martsimiris, as well as of the beautiful Mergravine Luise, whose story he had read also in some book.Then it occurred to his mind that the Jesuits made it their rule that any means were justified if only the end were attained.Fortifying himself somewhat with this historical fact, Mr. Golyadkin said to himself, What were the Jesuits?The Jesuits were every one of them very great fools; that he was better than any of them; that if only the refreshment-room would be empty for one minute (the door of the refreshment-room opened straight into the passage to the back stairs, where Mr. Golyadkin was in hiding now), he would, in spite of all the Jesuits in the world, go straight in, first from the refreshment-room into the tea-room, then into the room where they were now playing cards, and then straight into the hall where they were now dancing the polka, and he would go in—he would slip through—and that would be all, no one would notice him; and once there he would know what to do."
"嗨，我们发现这就是我们这个完全真实的故事的主人公的处境。然而，确实很难说清楚他当时是怎么了。实际情况是他要到楼梯后面去，到过道那里去，理由正如他所说的，“每个人都那样进去了，为何他不能呢？”但是，他没有冒险再向前闯，显然他不敢那样做……“不是因为有什么事是他不敢的，而只是因为他不愿意，因为他宁愿躲藏着”，所以他就在这里了，现在正等待机会溜进去，而且他已经等了两个半小时了。“为什么不等呢？维雷尔自己就等待过。可维雷尔和这有什么关系呢？”戈利亚德金先生想，“维雷尔是怎么扯进来的呢？但我……如何进去？……唉，你这蠢货！”戈利亚德金先生说道，用发麻的手指拧了一下自己发麻的脸颊，“你这愚蠢的傻瓜，你这傻穷光蛋——姓这么个愚蠢的姓！”","Well, so this is the position in which we find the hero of our perfectly true story, though, indeed, it is difficult to explain what was passing in him at that moment.The fact is that he had made his way to the back of the stairs and to the passage, on the ground that, as he said, “why shouldn’t he?and everyone did go that way?”; but he had not ventured to penetrate further, evidently he did not dare to do so ... “not because there was anything he did not dare, but just because he did not care to, because he preferred to be in hiding”; so here he was, waiting now for a chance to slip in, and he had been waiting for it two hours and a half.“Why not wait?Villesle himself had waited.But what had Villesle to do with it?” thought Mr. Golyadkin: “How does Villesle come in?But how am I to... to go and walk in?... Ech, you dummy!” said Mr. Golyadkin, pinching his benumbed cheek with his benumbed fingers; “you silly fool, you silly old Golyadkin—silly fool of a surname!” ..."
"但这些作践自己的话只是随便说说而已，没有任何明显的目的。现在，他就要继续向前，并悄悄溜进去了。餐具间空了，看不到一个人。戈利亚德金先生透过小窗户看到了这一切。他两步就迈到了门口，而且已经打开了门。“他该不该进去呢？得啦，进不进呢？我要进去……为什么不呢？对于勇者，到处都是路！”我们的主人公用这样的方式打消了自己的疑虑，突然而且完全出乎意料地退到了屏风后面。“不。”他想，“啊，现在有人进来了？是啊，他们进来了，我为何要在周围没人的时候磨蹭呢？即使如此，我还要悄悄溜进去吗？……不，这种性格的一个人怎么溜进去啊！呸，多么下三烂的作风啊！我胆小得像只母鸡！畏惧害怕就是我们的特色，这就是事实！在任何场合都卑躬屈膝就是我们的方式，关于这个，不需要来问我们了。就会像木杆一样站在这里，就是那样！在家里，我现在应该喝茶了……喝一杯茶也会令人很愉快的。如果我回去晚了，彼特鲁斯卡或许会发牢骚的。要不要回家呢？把这一切都罚入地狱！我要走了，一切结束了！”戈利亚德金先生这样考虑着自己的处境，向前猛冲去，好像有人碰到了他身上的发条似的。两步之后，他发现自己进了餐具间，于是扔掉大衣，脱掉帽子，匆匆地把这些东西塞进一个角落，整了整衣服，平整了心绪，然后……然后他向茶水间走去，又从茶水间冲进了隔壁的房间，从正在兴头上的牌手间悄悄溜了过去，几乎没有被人注意到，之后……戈利亚德金先生忘记了他周围发生的一切，像箭一般径直走进了客厅。","But these compliments paid to himself were only by the way and without any apparent aim.Now he was on the point of pushing forward and slipping in; the refreshment-room was empty and no one was in sight.Mr. Golyadkin saw all this through the little window; in two steps he was at the door and had already opened it.“Should he go in or not?Come, should he or not?I’ll go in... why not?to the bold all ways lie open!”Reassuring himself in this way, our hero suddenly and quite unexpectedly retreated behind the screen.“No,” he thought.“Ah, now, somebody’s coming in?Yes, they’ve come in; why did I dawdle when there were no people about?Even so, shall I go and slip in?... No, how slip in when a man has such a temperament!Fie, what a low tendency!I’m as scared as a hen!Being scared is our special line, that’s the fact of the matter!To be abject on every occasion is our line: no need to ask us about that.Just stand here like a post and that’s all!At home I should be having a cup of tea now... It would be pleasant, too, to have a cup of tea.If I come in later Petrushka’ll grumble, maybe.Shall I go home?Damnation take all this!I’ll go and that’ll be the end of it!”Reflecting on his position in this way, Mr. Golyadkin dashed forward as though some one had touched a spring in him; in two steps he found himself in the refreshment-room, flung off his overcoat, took off his hat, hurriedly thrust these things into a corner, straightened himself and smoothed himself down; then ...then he moved on to the tea-room, and from the tea-room darted into the next room, slipped almost unnoticed between the card-players, who were at the tip-top of excitement, then... Mr. Golyadkin forgot everything that was going on about him, and went straight as an arrow into the drawing room."
"好像命运安排的似的，他们没有在跳舞。女士们如画般成群地在房间里漫步来漫步去。男士们三三两两地站在那里或在房间里穿来穿去，邀请舞伴。戈利亚德金先生对此不予理会。他只看到克拉拉·奥尔苏菲耶芙娜，她的旁边是安德雷·菲利波维奇，接着是弗拉基米尔·谢苗诺维奇，还有两三个军官，最后还有两三个别的年轻人，他们也很有吸引力，谁都能一眼看出来，他们要么很有前途，要么实际上已经做出什么了……他也看到别的一些人。或者，他没看到任何人，也没有朝任何人看……然而，在使他冲进不请自来的舞会的同一根发条的驱使下，他向前移动了一下，接着又继续向前，更加向前。在道上，他撞到了一位大官员，踩了他的脚；不经意间踩了一位受人尊敬的老太太的裙子，并把裙子撕破了一点；推了一个端着盘子的仆人一下，之后又碰到了别的什么人。而他没有注意到这一切，继续一个劲地向前移动，突然发现自己正对着克拉拉·奥尔苏菲耶芙娜。毫无疑问，他此刻会非常高兴地、眼睛眨都不眨地钻进泥土里的。但是，曾经做过的事是无法收回的……是永远没法收回的。他要怎么做呢？“败不馁，胜不骄。”当然，戈利亚德金先生不是“一个耍阴谋诡计的人”，而且“在用自己的皮靴来蹭亮地板的技能方面并非技艺高超”。……而事实证明，确实如此。还有，耶稣会会士也插手了……尽管戈利亚德金先生目前顾不上管他们了！所有走来走去、喧闹嘈杂、谈笑风声的人们，仿佛在一个信号下突然安静了下来，并且渐渐拥到了戈利亚德金先生的周围。然而，他似乎什么也没听到，什么也没看到，他不能看……他不可能朝任何东西看的。他的眼睛盯着地板，就这么站着，顺便向自己保证，不管怎样，那晚都要开枪自杀。戈利亚德金先生发了这个誓后，在心里对自己说：“豁出去了！”令他自己都非常吃惊的是，他竟然出乎意料地开始讲话了。","As luck would have it they were not dancing.The ladies were promenading up and down the room in picturesque groups.The gentlemen were standing about in twos and threes or flitting about the room engaging partners.Mr. Golyadkin noticed nothing of this.He saw only Klara Olsufyevna, near her Andrey Filippovitch, then Vladimir Semyonovitch, two or three officers, and, finally, two or three other young men who were also very interesting and, as any one could see at once, were either very promising or had actually done something...He saw some one else too.Or, rather, he saw nobody and looked at nobody... but, moved by the same spring which had sent him dashing into the midst of a ball to which he had not been invited, he moved forward, and then forwarder and forwarder.On the way he jostled against a councillor and trod on his foot, and incidentally stepped on a very venerable old lady’s dress and tore it a little, pushed against a servant with a tray and then ran against somebody else, and, not noticing all this, passing further and further forward, he suddenly found himself facing Klara Olsufyevna.There is no doubt whatever that he would, with the utmost delight, without winking an eyelid, have sunk through the earth at that moment; but what has once been done cannot be recalled ... can never be recalled.What was he to do?“If I fail I don’t lose heart, if I succeed I persevere.”Mr. Golyadkin was, of course, not “one to intrigue,” and “not accomplished in the art of polishing the floor with his boots.” ... And so, indeed, it proved.Besides, the Jesuits had some hand in it too ... though Mr. Golyadkin had no thoughts to spare for them now!All the moving, noisy, laughing groups were suddenly hushed as though at a signal and, little by little, crowded round Mr. Golyadkin.He, however, seemed to hear nothing, to see nothing, he could not look ... he could not possibly look at anything; he kept his eyes on the floor and so stood, giving himself his word of honour, in passing, to shoot himself one way or another that night.Making this vow, Mr. Golyadkin inwardly said to himself, “Here goes!” and to his own great astonishment began unexpectedly to speak."
"他开始道贺，并有礼貌地致以祝福。道贺进行得很顺利，但在致以美好的祝福时，我们的主人公结巴了。他觉得，如果一结巴，那么一切都完了。果然如此——他结结巴巴，支支吾吾……一支吾，他就满脸通红；一脸红，他就不知所措了。他茫然地抬起了眼睛。一抬起眼，他就四下环顾；一环顾，他差点晕了过去……每个人都静静地站着，每个人都默不作声，稍近处还有笑声。戈利亚德金先生以一种谦逊、哀求的目光盯着安德雷·菲利波维奇。安德雷·菲利波维奇。安德雷·菲利波维奇以这样的目光回应，以致于如果我们的主人公还没有彻底完蛋的话，那么他肯定会再次完蛋的——也就是说，如果有那种可能的话。沉默持续了很久。","He began with congratulations and polite wishes.The congratulations went off well, but over the good wishes our hero stammered.He felt that if he stammered all would be lost at once.And so it turned out—he stammered and floundered... floundering, he blushed crimson; blushing, he was overcome with confusion.In his confusion he raised his eyes; raising his eyes he looked about him; looking about him—he almost swooned... Every one stood still, every one was silent, a little nearer there was laughter.Mr. Golyadkin fastened a humble, imploring look on Andrey Filippovitch.Andrey Filippovitch.Andrey Filippovitch responded with such a look that if our hero had not been utterly crushed already he certainly would have been crushed a second time—that is, if that were possible.The silence lasted long."
"“这在一定程度上与我的家庭状况和私生活有关，安德雷·菲利波维奇。”我们的主人公半死不活地、用勉强听得见的声音说道，“这不是公务上的事情，安德雷·菲利波维奇……”","“This is rather concerned with my domestic circumstances and my private life, Andrey Filippovitch,” our hero, half-dead, articulated in a scarcely audible voice; “it is not an official incident, Andrey Filippovitch...”"
"“真不害臊，先生，真不害臊！”安德雷·菲利波维奇悄声说道，带着一种难以描述的愤怒。说完这些话，他向克拉拉·奥尔苏菲耶芙娜伸出自己胳膊，挽着她，转身离开了戈利亚德金先生。","“For shame, sir, for shame!”Andrey Filippovitch pronounced in a half whisper, with an indescribable air of indignation; he pronounced these words and, giving Klara Olsufyevna his arm, he turned away from Mr. Golyadkin."
"“我没什么可害臊的，安德雷·菲利波维奇。”戈利亚德金先生也低声回答道，用他那可怜的眼神环顾着四周，无可奈何地试图从诧异的人群中发现点什么，以使他能够获得一个立足点，并挽回自己的社会地位。","“I’ve nothing to be ashamed of, Andrey Filippovitch,” answered Mr. Golyadkin, also in a whisper, turning his miserable eyes about him, trying helplessly to discover in the amazed crowd something on which he could gain a footing and retrieve his social position."
"“哎呀，没什么，这真没什么，各位！嗨，这算什么呀？哎呀，这种事可能发生在任何人身上的。”戈利亚德金先生低声说着。他稍微挪动了一下，试图从围着他的人群中逃离出来。","“Why, it’s all right, it’s nothing, gentlemen!Why, what’s the matter?Why, it might happen to any one,” whispered Mr. Golyadkin, moving a little away and trying to escape from the crowd surrounding him."
"他们给他让出了路。我们的主人公从两排好奇又惊讶的围观者中挤了出来。命运牵引着他。他自己也觉得鬼使神差的。当然，如果有机会能不失分寸地回到后楼梯处那个过道的话，他愿意为此付出高昂的代价。但由于那是绝对不可能的，因此他开始设法偷偷地离开，溜到一个角落，并站在那里——谦逊地、礼貌地，独自一人，不干涉任何人，不引起人们的特别注意，但同时又赢得主人和客人的好感。不过，戈利亚德金先生感觉地面似乎承受不住他，要倒塌了。他似乎摇摇晃晃，要跌倒了。最终，他到了一个角落，站在那里，像一个漠不关心、相当冷漠的旁观者。他把胳膊靠在两把椅子的椅背上，以那样的方式把它们完全占为己有，还尽可能满怀自信地扫视着聚在他周围的奥尔苏菲·伊万诺维奇的客人们。站得离他最近的是一位军官，一个个子高高的、英俊的小伙子。同他相比，戈利亚德金觉得自己就是只昆虫。","They made way for him.Our hero passed through two rows of inquisitive and wondering spectators.Fate drew him on.He felt himself, that fate was leading him on.He would have given a great deal, of course, for a chance to be back in the passage by the back stairs, without having committed a breach of propriety; but as that was utterly impossible he began trying to creep away into a corner and to stand there—modestly, decorously, apart, without interfering with any one, without attracting especial attention, but at the same time to win the favourable notice of his host and the company.At the same time Mr. Golyadkin felt as though the ground were giving way under him, as though he were staggering, falling.At last he made his way to a corner and stood in it, like an unconcerned, rather indifferent spectator, leaning his arms on the backs of two chairs, taking complete possession of them in that way, and trying, as far as he could, to glance confidently at Olsufy Ivanovitch’s guests, grouped about him.Standing nearest him was an officer, a tall and handsome fellow, beside whom Golyadkin felt himself an insect."
"“中尉，这两把椅子已经有人了，一把是克拉拉·奥尔苏菲耶芙娜的，另一把是公爵小姐切夫切汉诺娃的，我正为她们照管着呢。”戈利亚德金先生气喘吁吁地说道，把他那恳求的目光投向了这位军官。中尉没说什么，而是恶狠狠地笑了一下，转身离开了。我们的主人公在这里受阻后，打算到另一个地方碰碰运气，便直接跟一位胸上带着一枚十分显赫的十字勋章的重要官员说起话来。但是，这位大官员用如此冷冰冰的目光上下打量着他，使戈利亚德金先生明显觉得好像一大桶冷水泼到了他身上。他沉默了下来。他下定决心最好不声张，不开口，表现出他“很好”，他和“其他每个人一样”。他的处境，在他看来，还是相当不错的。他抱着这个目的，目光注视着自己的大衣衬里，然后抬起眼睛，把目光锁定在一位看起来很值得尊敬的先生身上。“那位先生带着假发。”戈利亚德金先生想，“如果脱掉那个假发，他就是个秃头，他的头会和我的手掌一样，光秃秃的。”戈利亚德金先生做出这一重大发现后，想到了阿拉伯的埃米尔。如果他们解下绿色包头巾（他们戴它，作为表示他们源于先知穆罕默德血统的一种标志），剩下的也是剃得光秃秃的头顶。之后，大概是由于浮想联翩地想到了土耳其人吧，他想到了土耳其的便鞋。关于那个，他想到了安德雷·菲利波维奇穿的是皮靴，而他的皮靴更像是便鞋，而不是皮靴。显然，戈利亚德金先生已经多少有点能忍受自己的处境了。“要是那个吊灯，”戈利亚德金先生的脑海中闪过，“从天花板上掉下来，落在客人身上怎么办。我应该立即冲过去救克拉拉·奥尔苏菲耶芙娜。救她！我应该喊叫。‘别担心，小姐，这无关紧要的，我会救你的，我。’然后……”这时，戈利亚德金先生向四周环顾了一下，寻找克拉拉·奥尔苏菲耶芙娜，却看到了奥尔苏菲·伊万诺维奇的老跟仆格拉西梅奇。格拉西梅奇带着一副非常忧虑又极其严肃的表情，径直向他走来。戈利亚德金先生吓了一跳，皱紧了眉头，有种莫名其妙但又很不愉快的感觉。他机械地四下看了看，突然想到要是自己能以某种方式悄悄爬出去，不被发现，偷偷地——只需消失就行，换句话说就是，表现出似乎他根本什么都没做，似乎那事与他没有丝毫的关系！……但是，我们的主人公还没能下定决心做任何事，格拉西梅奇就站在了他面前。","“These two chairs, lieutenant, are intended, one for Klara Olsufyevna, and the other for Princess Tchevtchehanov; I’m taking care of them for them,” said Mr. Golyadkin breathlessly, turning his imploring eyes on the officer.The lieutenant said nothing, but turned away with a murderous smile.Checked in this direction, our hero was about to try his luck in another quarter, and directly addressed an important councillor with a cross of great distinction on his breast.But the councillor looked him up and down with such a frigid stare that Mr. Golyadkin felt distinctly as though a whole bucketful of cold water had been thrown over him.He subsided into silence.He made up his mind that it was better to keep quiet, not to open his lips, and to show that he was “all right,” that he was “like every one else,” and that his position, as far as he could see, was quite a proper one.With this object he rivetted his gaze on the lining of his coat, then raised his eyes and fixed them upon a very respectable-looking gentleman.“That gentleman has a wig on,” thought Mr. Golyadkin; “and if he takes off that wig he will be bald, his head will be as bare as the palm of my hand.”Having made this important discovery, Mr. Golyadkin thought of the Arab Emirs, whose heads are left bare and shaven if they take off the green turbans they wear as a sign of their descent from the prophet Mahomet.Then, probably from some special connection of ideas with the Turks, he thought of Turkish slippers and at once, apropos of that, recalled the fact that Andrey Filippovitch was wearing boots, and that his boots were more like slippers than boots.It was evident that Mr. Golyadkin had become to some extent reconciled to his position.“What if that chandelier,” flashed through Mr. Golyadkin’s mind, “were to come down from the ceiling and fall upon the company.I should rush at once to save Klara Olsufyevna.Save her!I should cry.‘Don’t be alarmed, madam, it’s of no consequence, I will rescue you, I.’ Then...” At that moment Mr. Golyadkin looked about in search of Klara Olsufyevna, and saw Gerasimitch, Olsufy Ivanovitch’s old butler.Gerasimitch, with a most anxious and solemnly official air, was making straight for him.Mr. Golyadkin started and frowned from an unaccountable but most disagreeable sensation; he looked about him mechanically; it occurred to his mind that if only he could somehow creep off somewhere, unobserved, on the sly—simply disappear, that is, behave as though he had done nothing at all, as though the matter did not concern him in the least!... But before our hero could make up his mind to do anything, Gerasimitch was standing before him."
"“看到了吗，格拉西梅奇，”我们的主人公微微一笑，对格拉西梅奇说，“你去告诉他们——你看到那边吊灯架上的那支蜡烛了吗，格拉西梅奇——它马上就要掉下来了。所以，你也清楚，你必须告诉他们要注意一下。它真的要掉下来了，格拉西梅奇……”","“Do you see, Gerasimitch,” said our hero, with a little smile, addressing Gerasimitch; “you go and tell them—do you see the candle there in the chandelier, Gerasimitch—it will be falling down directly; so, you know, you must tell them to see to it; it really will fall down, Gerasimitch...”"
"“蜡烛？不，蜡烛竖得直直的。但有人在找你，先生。”","“The candle?No, the candle’s standing straight; but somebody is asking for you, sir.”"
"“谁在找我，格拉西梅奇？”","“Who is asking for me, Gerasimitch?”"
"“我真的说不上来究竟是谁，先生。一个带口信来的人。‘雅科夫·彼得罗维奇·戈利亚德金在这里吗？’他说。‘那么请叫他出来，’他说，‘有件非常要紧的事情……’你看。”","“I really can’t say, sir, who it is.A man with a message.‘Is Yakov Petrovitch Golyadkin here?’ says he.‘Then call him out,’ says he, ‘on very urgent and important business...’ you see.”"
"“不，格拉西梅奇，你犯了个错误。在那件事上，你弄错了，格拉西梅奇。”","“No, Gerasimitch, you are making a mistake; in that you are making a mistake, Gerasimitch.”"
"“不一定吧，先生。”","“I doubt it, sir.”"
"“不，格拉西梅奇，不是未必，对此没什么好怀疑的，格拉西梅奇。没有人在找我，而且我在这里十分自在——也就是说，在适合我的地方，格拉西梅奇。”","“No, Gerasimitch, it isn’t doubtful; there’s nothing doubtful about it, Gerasimitch.Nobody’s asking for me, but I’m quite at home here—that is, in my right place, Gerasimitch.”"
"戈利亚德金先生歇了口气，四下看了看。的确！房间里的每一个人都把目光集中在他身上，带着几分郑重的期待在听着。男士们拥挤在稍近一点的地方，注意力非常集中。稍远一点的地方，女士们在一起窃窃私语着。男主人出现在了离戈利亚德金先生不远的地方，不过无法从他的表情看出他是否也在密切而直接地关注着戈利亚德金先生的处境，因为一切都做得很微妙。然而，尽管如此，这一切却使我们的主人公感到，对他来说，关键的时刻到了。戈利亚德金先生清楚地看到采取原来的举措的时刻来了，这是使他的敌人蒙羞的时机。戈利亚德金先生十分激动。他觉得有几分鼓舞，于是，用一种颤抖并且令人印象深刻的声音，他又开始对等着的跟仆说：","Mr. Golyadkin took breath and looked about him.Yes! Every one in the room, all had their eyes fixed upon him, and were listening in a sort of solemn expectation.The men had crowded a little nearer and were all attention.A little further away the ladies were whispering together.The master of the house made his appearance at no great distance from Mr. Golyadkin, and though it was impossible to detect from his expression that he, too, was taking a close and direct interest in Mr. Golyadkin’s position, for everything was being done with delicacy, yet, nevertheless, it all made our hero feel that the decisive moment had come for him.Mr. Golyadkin saw clearly that the time had come for a old stroke, the chance of putting his enemies to shame.Mr. Golyadkin was in great agitation.He was aware of a sort of inspiration and, in a quivering and impressive voice, he began again, addressing the waiting butler—"
"“不，我亲爱的朋友，没人在叫我。你弄错啦。我还要多说点：你今天上午也弄错了，你让我相信……胆敢让我相信，我是说（他提高了嗓音），奥尔苏菲·伊万诺维奇在我记忆中一直是我的资助者，在某种意义上，对我来说，也是一个父亲，他在为他的心肝宝贝举家隆重欢庆的时刻竟给我闭门羹。”(戈利亚德金先生沾沾自喜而又深情地向四周环顾了一下，眼睫毛上闪现着泪花。）“我再说一遍，我的朋友，”我们的主人公最后说道，“你弄错啦，你大大地、不可饶恕地弄错啦……”","“No, my dear fellow, no one’s calling for me.You are mistaken.I will say more: you were mistaken this morning too, when you assured me... dared to assure me, I say (he raised his voice), that Olsufy Ivanovitch, who has been my benefactor for as long as I can remember and has, in a sense, been a father to me, was shutting his door upon me at the moment of solemn family rejoicing for his paternal heart.”(Mr. Golyadkin looked about him complacently, but with deep feeling.A tear glittered on his eyelash.)“I repeat, my friend,” our hero concluded, “you were mistaken, you were cruelly and unpardonably mistaken...”"
"这是个庄严的时刻。戈利亚德金先生感到效果非常明显。他站着，谦逊地垂下目光，期待着奥尔苏菲·伊万诺维奇来拥抱他。客人们明显地表现出激动不已和困惑迷茫，甚至连固执又讨厌的格拉西梅奇在说“不一定……”时也支吾其词了。此时，残酷无情的乐队突然没缘由地奏起了波尔卡舞曲。一切都完了，一切都随风飘散了。戈利亚德金先生吓了一跳，格拉西梅奇后退了几步，屋子里的一切开始像大海般涌动起来。费拉基米尔·谢苗诺维奇与克拉拉·奥尔苏菲耶芙娜带头跳舞，而那位英俊的中尉则与公爵小姐切夫切汉诺娃跟随其后。观看者们好奇而欣喜地挤进去，观看他们跳波尔卡舞——一个有趣、时髦、新颖的舞蹈，令每个人为之疯狂。戈利亚德金先生暂时被遗忘了。但是，突然，一切都陷入了骚动、混乱和喧闹中。音乐停止了……一件奇怪的事情发生了。克拉拉·奥尔苏菲耶芙娜跳得疲惫不堪，累得几乎喘不过气来，她脸颊发热，气喘吁吁的，倒在了扶手椅里，完全筋疲力尽了……所有人的心都转向了这个令人着迷的美人，所有人都争先恐后地称赞她，感谢她给他们带来的欢乐。突然，戈利亚德金先生站在了她面前。他脸色苍白，极其烦躁不安。他仿佛也完全精疲力竭了，几乎无法动弹。不知为何，他微笑着，哀求地伸出一只手。克拉拉·奥尔苏菲耶芙娜惊呆了，以致于还没来得及把手缩回来，就在他的邀请下，机械地站了起来。戈利亚德金先生先向前晃了一下，接着又晃了一下，然后抬起了腿，之后蹭了一下地板，接着有点像是跺了一下脚，接着绊了一下……他也想和克拉拉·奥尔苏菲耶芙娜跳舞。克拉拉·奥尔苏菲耶芙娜尖叫了一声。大家都跑过来，把她的手从戈利亚德金先生的手里解救了出来。于是，我们的主人公马上被人群挤了出来，几乎有十步之远。在他的周围也聚集了一圈人。忽然传来了两位老太太的尖叫声和叫喊声。他在撤退时几乎把这两位老太太撞倒。情况非常混乱，所有人都在质问，每个人都在叫喊，每个人都在抱怨。乐队无声了。我们的主人公在自己的圈子里转来转去，机械地佯笑着，自己在嘀咕着什么，像是“为什么不呢？”，“那个波尔卡舞，目前，至少在他看来，是一种新颖而又十分有趣的舞蹈，是为女士们消遣而创作的……但是，既然事情发展成这样，他也准备好同意了。”可是，很明显，没有人想到要问戈利亚德金先生是否同意。我们的主人公突然感到有一只手放在他的胳膊上，另一只手压在他的背上，异常关切地把他引到了某个方向。最终，他注意到自己正径直向门口走去。戈利亚德金先生想说些什么，想做些什么……但是，不，他不再想做任何事了。他只是机械地报以一笑。终于，他发觉他们在给他穿大衣，他的帽子扣在眼睛上。最后，他觉得自己在门厅里，在楼梯上，在黑暗与寒冷中。最后，他绊了一下，觉得自己掉下了悬崖，在努力叫喊——突然，他发现自己在庭院里。空气凉飕飕地向他吹来，他静静地站了片刻。就在此时，乐队又奏响了，乐曲传到了他这里。戈利亚德金先生突然想起了一切，似乎他所有渐渐低落的活力又回来了。之前他一直站着，似乎钉在了那里，但现在，他拔腿就跑，慌慌张张地匆忙离开，随便到哪里，哪里都成，运气把他带到哪里算哪里。","The moment was a solemn one.Mr. Golyadkin felt that the effect was quite certain.He stood with modestly downcast eyes, expecting Olsufy Ivanovitch to embrace him.Excitement and perplexity were apparent in the guests, even the inflexible and terrible Gerasimitch faltered over the words “I doubt it...” when suddenly the ruthless orchestra, apropos of nothing, struck up a polka.All was lost, all was scattered to the winds.Mr. Golyadkin started; Gerasimitch stepped back; everything in the room began undulating like the sea; and Vladimir Semyonovitch led the dance with Klara Olsufyevna, while the handsome lieutenant followed with Princess Tchevtchehanov.Onlookers, curious and delighted, squeezed in to watch them dancing the polka—an interesting, fashionable new dance which every one was crazy over.Mr. Golyadkin was, for the time, forgotten.But suddenly all were thrown into excitement, confusion and bustle; the music ceased... a strange incident had occurred.Tired out with the dance, and almost breathless with fatigue, Klara Olsufyevna, with glowing cheeks and heaving bosom, sank into an armchair, completely exhausted... All hearts turned to the fascinating creature, all vied with one another in complimenting her and thanking her for the pleasure conferred on them, —all at once there stood before her Mr. Golyadkin.He was pale, extremely perturbed; he, too, seemed completely exhausted, he could scarcely move.He was smiling for some reason, he stretched out his hand imploringly.Klara Olsufyevna was so taken aback that she had not time to withdraw hers and mechanically got up at his invitation.Mr. Golyadkin lurched forward, first once, then a second time, then lifted his leg, then made a scrape, then gave a sort of stamp, then stumbled ... he, too, wanted to dance with Klara Olsufyevna.Klara Olsufyevna uttered a shriek; every one rushed to release her hand from Mr. Golyadkin’s, and in a moment our hero was carried almost ten paces away by the rush of the crowd.A circle formed round him too.Two old ladies, whom he had almost knocked down in his retreat raised a great shrieking and outcry.The confusion was awful; all were asking questions, every one was shouting, every one was finding fault.The orchestra was silent.Our hero whirled round in his circle and mechanically, with a resemblance of a smile, muttered something to himself, such as, “Why not?” and “that the polka, so far, at least, as he could see, was a new and very interesting dance, invented for the diversion of the ladies... but that since things had taken this turn, he was ready to consent.”But Mr. Golyadkin’s consent no one apparently thought of asking.Our hero was suddenly aware that some one’s hand was laid on his arm, that another hand was pressed against his back, that he was with peculiar solicitude being guided in a certain direction.At last he noticed that he was going straight to the door.Mr. Golyadkin wanted to say something, to do something...But no, he no longer wanted to do anything.He only mechanically kept laughing in answer.At last he was aware that they were putting on his greatcoat, that his hat was thrust over his eyes; finally he felt that he was in the entry on the stairs in the dark and cold.At last he stumbled, he felt that he was falling down a precipice; he tried to cry out—and suddenly he found himself in the courtyard.The air blew fresh on him, he stood still for a minute; at that very instant, the strains reached him of the orchestra striking up again.Mr. Golyadkin suddenly recalled it all; it seemed to him that all his flagging energies came back to him again.He had been standing as though rivetted to the spot, but now he started off and rushed away headlong, anywhere, into the air, into freedom, wherever chance might take him."

"彼得堡所有的钟塔都敲响了午夜十二点。当时戈利亚德金先生发狂似的跑了出去，跑到伊兹梅洛夫桥附近的芳坦卡河边，逃避他的敌人，逃避迫害，逃避瞄向他的寒冷与痛苦的冰雹，逃避紧张不安的老太太们的大呼小叫，逃避女人们的长吁短叹，逃避安德雷·菲利波维奇恶狠狠的眼神。戈利亚德金先生被杀死了——从完整意义上说，彻底被杀死了。如果他还保留有奔跑的力气的话，那仅仅是由于某种奇迹，一种最终他自己都无法相信的奇迹。这是个糟糕的十一月的夜晚——潮湿，雾茫茫的，阴雨绵绵，大雪纷飞，到处都是感冒头疼、发热、面部浮肿、扁桃体炎、各种各样的炎症——实际上，充满了彼得堡十一月份的所有馈赠。风在荒凉的街道上咆哮着，把运河里的黑河水掀得涨出了岸边的吊环，肆意地吹刮着细小的灯柱。灯柱以尖细刺耳的嘎吱声与风的咆哮声相呼应，形成了一场无止境的、嘎吱作响的、刺耳的演奏会。彼得堡的每一个居民对此是那么的熟悉。雪和雨在同时下着。在风的吹打下，一串串雨水几乎呈水平状地喷出，就像从消防队员的水龙带里出来似的，如千万只针头和别针在扎着和刺着不幸的戈利亚德金先生的脸。打破这夜晚的宁静的只有远处马车的隆隆声、风的咆哮声和灯柱的咯吱声，还有雨水从每家屋顶、每个走廊、每个管道以及每个屋檐流到人行道上铺的花岗岩上时发出的阴沉的泼溅声和汩汩声。无论近处还是远处，一个人影都没有。的确，在这个时刻和这样的天气，似乎也不可能有人的。所以，只有戈利亚德金先生独自一人绝望地沿着芳坦卡河边的人行道惊恐而逃。他迈着惯常的急促的碎步，想赶快回到家里，尽快地回到他在六铺街四层楼自己的寓所里。","It was striking midnight from all the clock towers in Petersburg when Mr. Golyadkin, beside himself, ran out on the Fontanka Quay, close to the Ismailovsky Bridge, fleeing from his foes, from persecution, from a hailstorm of nips and pinches aimed at him, from the shrieks of excited old ladies, from the Ohs and Ahs of women and from the murderous eyes of Andrey Filippovitch.Mr. Golyadkin was killed—killed entirely, in the full sense of the word, and if he still preserved the power of running, it was simply through some sort of miracle, a miracle in which at last he refused himself to believe.It was an awful November night—wet, foggy, rainy, snowy, teeming with colds in the head, fevers, swollen faces, quinseys, inflammations of all kinds and descriptions—teeming, in fact, with all the gifts of a Petersburg November.The wind howled in the deserted streets, lifting up the black water of the canal above the rings on the bank, and irritably brushing against the lean lamp-posts which chimed in with its howling in a thin, shrill creak, keeping up the endless squeaky, jangling concert with which every inhabitant of Petersburg is so familiar.Snow and rain were falling both at once.Lashed by the wind, the streams of rainwater spurted almost horizontally, as though from a fireman’s hose, pricking and stinging the face of the luckless Mr. Golyadkin like a thousand pins and needles.In the stillness of the night, broken only by the distant rumbling of carriages, the howl of the wind and the creaking of the lamp-posts, there was the dismal sound of the splash and gurgle of water, rushing from every roof, every porch, every pipe and every cornice, on to the granite of the pavement.There was not a soul, near or far, and, indeed, it seemed there could not be at such an hour and in such weather.And so only Mr. Golyadkin, alone with his despair, was fleeing in terror along the pavement of Fontanka, with his usual rapid little step, in haste to get home as soon as possible to his flat on the fourth storey in Shestilavotchny Street."
"尽管雨、雪以及暴风雪和雾气那种无名的恐怖，在彼得堡十一月的天空下，一起向本来就已经备受打击的戈利亚德金先生袭来，对他丝毫不讲仁慈，不给他任何喘息的机会，把他彻底淋透了，糊住了他的眼睑，从四面八方直接吹打着他，令他感到莫名其妙，困惑不解——尽管这一切同他所有的敌人勾结起来，为他密谋策划了一个美妙的白天、傍晚和夜晚，尽管如此，戈利亚德金先生对命运捉弄人的这一最终证据却几乎毫无反应：几分钟前在五品文官贝伦捷耶夫家里发生的一切如此强烈地震憾了他，那种触动太强烈了！任何一个漠不关心的旁观者如果在不经意间瞥一眼戈利亚德金先生那艰难的行进，他肯定会说，戈利亚德金先生看上去似乎想要躲避他自己，好像他在努力逃离他自己！真的！真是这样的。他可能还会多说一句：戈利亚德金先生不仅想要逃离他自己，而且还想毁掉自己，不再是他自己，想回归尘土。此时，他对自己周围的一切视而不见，对周围发生的一切毫不明白，看上去好像对他来说，那暴风雨的夜晚、那长途跋涉、那雨、那雪、那风、那天气的所有恶劣带来的痛苦都不存在似的。橡胶套鞋从戈利亚德金先生右脚的皮靴上滑下来，被甩在了芳坦卡河边人行道的积雪和淤泥中，但戈利亚德金先生却没想着回去把它捡起来。其实，他都没有注意到它已经掉了。他是如此茫然不知所措，以致于竟不管周围的一切而好几次一动不动地站在人行道中间，完全被不久前那可怕的羞辱所攫住了。那一刻他死了，消失了。之后，他又像疯子似的突然离开，头也不回地跑啊跑啊，仿佛有人在追捕他，仿佛他正在躲避某种更可怕的灾难……这处境确实太可怕了！最后，戈利亚德金先生精疲力尽，停了下来，靠在栏杆上，那姿势就像一个鼻子突然开始流血的人。他开始专心地看着运河那黑漆漆的、浑浊的河水。人们只知道那时戈利亚德金先生失望到了极点，是如此疲惫不堪，如此饱受折磨，如此筋疲力竭，如此虚弱无力，因而他忘记了一切，忘记了伊兹梅洛夫桥，忘记了六铺街，忘记了他目前的困境……毕竟，对他来说，这有什么关系呢？事情已经做了。判决已经被证实并批准了，他还能做什么呢？突然……他突然一惊，不由自主地往旁边蹦了两步。他带着莫名其妙的不安，开始注视着周围，但是，一个人也没有，也没什么特别的事发生，然而……然而，他恍惚觉得刚才，就在那一刻，有人站在他的不远处，就在他旁边，也同样靠在栏杆上，而且——说起来太不可思议了——甚至对他说了些什么，迅速、唐突、含含糊糊地说了些什么，然而，这些事与工作完全无关，这些事是关于他自己的。","Though the snow, the rain, and all the nameless horrors of a raging snowstorm and fog, under a Petersburg November sky, were attacking Mr. Golyadkin, already shattered by misfortunes, were showing him no mercy, giving him no rest, drenching him to the bone, glueing up his eyelids, blowing right through him from all sides, baffling and perplexing him—though conspiring and combining with all his enemies to make a grand day, evening, and night for him, in spite of all this Mr. Golyadkin was almost insensible to this final proof of the persecution of destiny: so violent had been the shock and the impression made upon him a few minutes before at the civil councillor Berendyev’s!If any disinterested spectator could have glanced casually at Mr. Golyadkin’s painful progress, he would certainly have said that Mr. Golyadkin looked as though he wanted to hide from himself, as though he were trying to run away from himself!Yes!It was really so.One may say more: Mr. Golyadkin did not want only to run away from himself, but to be obliterated, to cease to be, to return to dust.At the moment he took in nothing surrounding him, understood nothing of what was going on about him, and looked as though the miseries of the stormy night, of the long tramp, the rain, the snow, the wind, all the cruelty of the weather, did not exist for him.The golosh slipping off the boot on Mr. Golyadkin’s right foot was left behind in the snow and slush on the pavement of Fontanka, and Mr. Golyadkin did not think of turning back to get it, did not, in fact, notice that he had lost it.He was so perplexed that, in spite of everything surrounding him, he stood several times stockstill in the middle of the pavement, completely possessed by the thought of his recent horrible humiliation; at that instant he was dying, disappearing; then he suddenly set off again like mad and ran and ran without looking back, as though he were pursued, as though he were fleeing from some still more awful calamity...The position was truly awful!... At last Mr. Golyadkin halted in exhaustion, leaned on the railing in the attitude of a man whose nose has suddenly begun to bleed, and began looking intently at the black and troubled waters of the canal.All that is known is that at that instant Mr. Golyadkin reached such a pitch of despair, was so harassed, so tortured, so exhausted, and so weakened in what feeble faculties were left him that he forgot everything, forgot the Ismailovsky Bridge, forgot Shestilavotchny Street, forgot his present plight ...After all, what did it matter to him?The thing was done.The decision was affirmed and ratified; what could he do?All at once... all at once he started and involuntarily skipped a couple of paces aside.With unaccountable uneasiness he began gazing about him; but no one was there, nothing special had happened, and yet... and yet he fancied that just now, that very minute, some one was standing near him, beside him, also leaning on the railing, and—marvellous to relate!—had even said something to him, said something quickly, abruptly, not quite intelligibly, but something quite private, something concerning himself."
"“哎呀，难道是我的幻觉？”戈利亚德金先生说道，又朝周围看了一下。“但我这是站在哪里呀？唉，唉。”他最终想道，摇了摇头，可是，带着一种不安而痛苦的伤感，他开始凝视着潮湿又昏暗的远方，使劲睁大眼睛，竭力想用他的近视眼穿透展现在他周围的那潮湿的阴暗。然而，没什么新的东西，也没什么特别的东西能引起戈利亚德金先生的注意。一切看起来都很正常，好像本来就该那样，换句话说，雪下的更猛烈了、更密了，雪花更大了，二十步之外的任何东西都无法看到了；灯柱发出的嘎吱声比以往更刺耳了；风似乎也也更加可怜、更加哀婉地唱着忧郁的歌，就像一个纠缠不休的乞丐在乞求一个铜板，好得到一片面包一样。此时，一种新的感觉占据了戈利亚德金先生的全身：更加苦恼，更加恐惧……一种狂热的战栗流遍他的全身。这一刻让人不快，令人难以忍受！“嗨，没什么，或许根本就没什么，而且根本就不会败坏任何人的名誉。或许本来就该那样的。”他继续说着，自己也不甚明白他在说什么，“也许这一切到头来都是最好的，而且没什么可抱怨的，每个人都是有正当理由的。”","“Why, was it my fancy?” said Mr. Golyadkin, looking round once more.“But where am I standing?... Ech, ech,” he thought finally, shaking his head, though he began gazing with an uneasy, miserable feeling into the damp, murky distance, straining his sight and doing his utmost to pierce with his short-sighted eyes the wet darkness that stretched all round him.There was nothing new, however, nothing special caught the eye of Mr. Golyadkin.Everything seemed to be all right, as it should be, that is, the snow was falling more violently, more thickly and in larger flakes, nothing could be seen twenty paces away, the lamp-posts creaked more shrilly than ever and the wind seemed to intone its melancholy song even more tearfully, more piteously, like an importunate beggar whining for a copper to get a crust of bread.At the same time a new sensation took possession of Mr. Golyadkin’s whole being: agony upon agony, terror upon terror... a feverish tremor ran through his veins.The moment was insufferably unpleasant!“Well, no matter; perhaps it’s no matter at all, and there’s no stain on any one’s honour.Perhaps it’s as it should be,” he went on, without understanding what he was saying.“Perhaps it will all be for the best in the end, and there will be nothing to complain of, and every one will be justified.”"
"戈利亚德金先生就这样说着，用话语自我安慰着。他稍微抖了抖身子，抖掉落在帽子、衣领、大衣、领带、皮靴及一切东西上并积成厚厚一层的雪花——但是，他那种奇怪的感觉，那种奇怪、莫名其妙而又难以摆脱的痛苦却无法甩掉。不知远处的什么地方响起了大炮射击的轰鸣声。“啊，什么天气嘛！”我们的主人公想道，“听！难道要发洪水了吗？水似乎在猛烈地上涨。”","Talking like this and comforting himself with words, Mr. Golyadkin shook himself a little, shook off the snow which had drifted in thick layers on his hat, his collar, his overcoat, his tie, his boots and everything—but his strange feeling, his strange obscure misery he could not get rid of, could not shake off.Somewhere in the distance there was the boom of a cannon shot.“Ach, what weather!” thought our hero.“Tchoo! isn’t there going to be a flood?It seems as though the water has risen so violently.”"
"戈利亚德金先生刚刚说完或想罢，就看到一个人向他走来。无疑也跟他一样，因某种意外而在夜间赶路。人们或许认为这是个无足轻重的偶然事故。但不知为何，戈利亚德金先生却很担忧，甚至被吓坏了，而且十分慌张。并不是他真的害怕什么不怀好意的人，而仅仅是“或许……毕竟，谁知道呢，这个赶夜路的人”，戈利亚德金先生的脑海里突然闪过，“也许正是他，也许他才是最重要的，他不会毫无缘由地出现在这里，而是有目的的，是想与我相遇，把我激怒。”然而，也许他并没有仔细地想这些，而只是有种类似与此的瞬间感觉，很不愉快的感觉。不过，他没时间思考和感觉了。那个陌生人离他只有两步之遥了。戈利亚德金先生按他惯常的做法，匆忙装出一副十分独特的神态，那神态清楚地表示出他，戈利亚德金，就是他自己，他”很好“，路很宽阔，足以让所有人都能过去，他，戈利亚德金，没有妨碍任何人。突然，他半中间停了下来，好像被吓呆了，好像被闪电击了似的，然后迅速转过身去，寻找刚刚经过他的那个人——他转过去，似乎有人在后面猛地拽了他一下，好像风在使他转动，就像风标那样。那个过路人立即消失在了暴风雪中。他也快步走着，穿着像戈利亚德金先生，并且像他一样，从头到脚包裹着，而且也沿着芳坦卡河边的人行道跌跌绊绊地向前小跑着，迈着急促的碎步，这表明他有点害怕。","Mr. Golyadkin had hardly said or thought this when he saw a person coming towards him, belated, no doubt, like him, through some accident.An unimportant, casual incident, one might suppose, but for some unknown reason Mr. Golyadkin was troubled, even scared, and rather flurried.It was not that he was exactly afraid of some ill-intentioned man, but just that “perhaps... after all, who knows, this belated individual,” flashed through Mr. Golyadkin’s mind, “maybe he’s that very thing, maybe he’s the very principal thing in it, and isn’t here for nothing, but is here with an object, crossing my path and provoking me.”Possibly, however, he did not think this precisely, but only had a passing feeling of something like it—and very unpleasant.There was no time, however, for thinking and feeling.The stranger was already within two paces.Mr. Golyadkin, as he invariably did, hastened to assume a quite peculiar air, an air that expressed clearly that he, Golyadkin, kept himself to himself, that he was “all right,” that the road was wide enough for all, and that he, Golyadkin, was not interfering with any one.Suddenly he stopped short as though petrified, as though struck by lightning, and quickly turned round after the figure which had only just passed him—turned as though some one had given him a tug from behind, as though the wind had turned him like a weathercock.The passer-by vanished quickly in the snowstorm.He, too, walked quickly; he was dressed like Mr. Golyadkin and, like him, too, wrapped up from head to foot, and he, too, tripped and trotted along the pavement of Fontanka with rapid little steps that suggested that he was a little scared."
"“什么——这是怎么回事嘛？”戈利亚德金先生悄声说道，怀疑地微笑着，不过，他浑身发抖。一阵冰冷的寒战穿过他的后背。这时，那个陌生人已经完全消失了，他的脚步声没有了，但戈利亚德金先生仍然站着，凝视着他的背影。不过，他最终渐渐地恢复了常态。","“What—what is it?” whispered Mr. Golyadkin, smiling mistrustfully, though he trembled all over.An icy shiver ran down his back.Meanwhile, the stranger had vanished completely; there was no sound of his step, while Mr. Golyadkin still stood and gazed after him.At last, however, he gradually came to himself."
"“咦，这是怎么回事啊？”他懊恼地想着，“难道我真的心智失常啦，还是怎么啦？”他转过去，接着走自己的路，脚步越来越快，尽力不去想任何事。抱着同样的目的，他最后甚至闭上了眼睛。突然，透过风的呼啸声和暴风雪的喧嚣声，在很近的地方，脚步声又传到了他的耳朵里。他吓了一跳，睁开了眼睛。又一个快速向他靠近的人影出现在了他面前，黑乎乎的，离他大约二十步之遥。这个很小的身影在匆匆忙忙地赶路，急急慌慌的。他们之间的距离很快就缩短了。戈利亚德金先生直到现在才完全看清这第二个赶夜路的伙伴。他看清后，带着惊愕和恐惧尖叫了起来，两腿发软。这是十分钟前就经过他的同一个人，这个人现在又完全出乎意料地出现在了他面前。但是，这并不是让戈利亚德金先生吃惊的唯一的惊奇之处。他是如此的惊愕，竟站着一动不动，叫喊着，努力说着什么，还急忙跑着去追赶那个陌生人，甚至朝他喊了句什么，大概是希望他尽快停下来吧。那个陌生人的确在离戈利亚德金先生十步远处停下了。因此，旁边灯柱发出的光完全照在了他的整个身上——他静静地站着，朝戈利亚德金先生转过去，带着一副不耐烦而又忧虑的面容，等着听他要说什么。","“Why, what’s the meaning of it?” he thought with vexation.“Why, have I really gone out of my mind, or what?”He turned and went on his way, making his footsteps more rapid and frequent, and doing his best not to think of anything at all.He even closed his eyes at last with the same object.Suddenly, through the howling of the wind and the uproar of the storm, the sound of steps very close at hand reached his ears again.He started and opened his eyes.Again a rapidly approaching figure stood out black before him, some twenty paces away.This little figure was hastening, tripping along, hurrying nervously; the distance between them grew rapidly less.Mr. Golyadkin could by now get a full view of the second belated companion.He looked full at him and cried out with amazement and horror; his legs gave way under him.It was the same individual who had passed him ten minutes before, and who now quite unexpectedly turned up facing him again.But this was not the only marvel that struck Mr. Golyadkin.He was so amazed that he stood still, cried out, tried to say something, and rushed to overtake the stranger, even shouted something to him, probably anxious to stop him as quickly as possible.The stranger did, in fact, stop ten paces from Mr. Golyadkin, so that the light from the lamp-post that stood near fell full upon his whole figure—stood still, turned to Mr. Golyadkin, and with impatient and anxious face waited to hear what he would say."
"“对不起，可能是我弄错了。”我们的主人公用颤抖的声音说。","“Excuse me, possibly I’m mistaken,” our hero brought out in a quavering voice."
"那个陌生人带着恼怒的神态，默默地转过去，继续快速地走自己的路，似乎急着要弥补浪费在戈利亚德金先生身上的那两秒钟。至于戈利亚德金先生，他全身都在发颤，膝盖发软，打着哆嗦。他发出一声呻吟，蹲坐在人行道边的一个石柱上。不过，他如此紧张不知所措确实是有原因的。事实就是，不知怎么，这个陌生人对他来说似乎有点眼熟。不过，那还不算什么。可是，他认出了，几乎确定地认出了这个人。他以前就经常看到他，就那个人，什么时候就看到过他，而且刚不久前也看到过，那是在哪里呢？想必不是昨天吧？但话又说回来，主要的还不是戈利亚德金先生以前就常常看到他。那个人几乎没有任何特别的地方，那个人乍一看也不会引起任何特别的注意。他只是一个普通人，像其他人一样，像其他所有绅士那样的一个君子，当然，或许他也有一些优秀的品质和很珍贵的品德——其实，他就是他自己。戈利亚德金先生对这个人没有丝毫的厌恶和仇恨，甚至没有一丁点儿的敌意——实际上，似乎正好相反——然而（而这才是重点），他不会为了世界上的任何宝物而乐意去见那个人的，尤其是，比如说，像现在这样碰见他。我们可以再多说点：戈利亚德金先生对那人十分了解，他甚至知道人们是怎么称呼他的，他的名字是什么。然而，没有什么东西会引诱他，他也不会为了世界上的任何宝物而同意说出他的名字，承认他叫什么什么，他父亲的名字是这个，他的姓是那个。戈利亚德金先生的恍惚是持续了一小会儿还是很长一段时间，他在人行道的石柱上是否坐了很久，我没法说。不过，等他最终稍微静下心来后，突然开始奔跑，也不看四周，拼命地跑。他的思想高度集中，有两次，他绊了一下，还差点摔倒——在这种情况下，他的另一只皮靴也痛失了自己的橡胶套鞋。最后，戈利亚德金先生为了缓了口气，把步伐放慢了一些，他匆匆环顾了一下四周，看到自己在不知不觉中已经跑过了一段涅瓦大街，而现在正站在通往铸铁街的拐弯处。戈利亚德金先生拐进了铸铁街。他在那一刻的处境就好比一个人正站在可怕的悬崖边，他下面的地面突然裂开了，已经在摇晃，在移动，在做最后一次晃动，在坍塌，正把他拉进无底深渊。然而，这个不幸的可怜人既没有力气也没有决心向后跳，把目光从下面那张着大口的深壑移开。那个无底深渊拽着他，最后他自己跳了进去，他自己使毁灭的那一刻加快了。戈利亚德金先生知道，也感觉到，而且坚信，在路上，其某他种祸害肯定会降临在他身上，某些不愉快的事会突然发生，他会，比如说，再次遇见那个陌生人。但是——说也奇怪，他极其渴望这次相遇，认为那是不可避免的，而他只求那一切会尽快结束，只求能想方设法从自己的处境中解脱出来，不过要尽快。同时，他不停地跑啊跑啊，似乎被某种外力推动着，因为他感觉浑身虚脱和麻木，他无法想起任何事情，虽然他的思绪像荆棘那样抓住了所有的一切。一只小流浪狗被雨水淋透了，浑身在打颤，老是缠着戈利亚德金先生，在他旁边奔跑，耷拉着尾巴和耳朵急匆匆地跑着，还时不时胆怯而又聪明地看看他。一个遥远的、早已被遗忘的念头——对很久以前发生的事情的某些记忆——现在重新浮现在了他的脑海中，像用一把锤子在不停地敲击着他的大脑，使他很恼火但又无法摆脱。","The stranger in silence, and with an air of annoyance, turned and rapidly went on his way, as though in haste to make up for the two seconds he had wasted on Mr. Golyadkin.As for the latter, he was quivering in every nerve, his knees shook and gave way under him, and with a moan he squatted on a stone at the edge of the pavement.There really was reason, however, for his being so overwhelmed.The fact is that this stranger seemed to him somehow familiar.That would have been nothing, though.But he recognised, almost certainly recognised this man.He had often seen him, that man, had seen him some time, and very lately too; where could it have been?Surely not yesterday?But, again, that was not the chief thing that Mr. Golyadkin had often seen him before; there was hardly anything special about the man; the man at first sight would not have aroused any special attention.He was just a man like any one else, a gentleman like all other gentlemen, of course, and perhaps he had some good qualities and very valuable one too—in fact, he was a man who was quite himself.Mr. Golyadkin cherished no sort of hatred or enmity, not even the slightest hostility towards this man—quite the contrary, it would seem, indeed—and yet (and this was the real point) he would not for any treasure on earth have been willing to meet that man, and especially to meet him as he had done now, for instance.We may say more: Mr. Golyadkin knew that man perfectly well, he even knew what he was called, what his name was; and yet nothing would have induced him, and again, for no treasure on earth would he have consented to name him, to consent to acknowledge that he was called so-and-so, that his father’s name was this and his surname was that.Whether Mr. Golyadkin’s stupefaction lasted a short time or a long time, whether he was sitting for a long time on the stone of the pavement I cannot say; but, recovering himself a little at last, he suddenly fell to running, without looking round, as fast as his legs could carry him; his mind was preoccupied, twice he stumbled and almost fell—and through this circumstance his other boot was also bereaved of its golosh.At last Mr. Golyadkin slackened his pace a little to get breath, looked hurriedly round and saw that he had already, without being aware of it, run passed part of the Nevsky Prospect and was now standing at the turning into Liteyny Street.Mr. Golyadkin turned into Liteyny Street.His position at that instant was like that of a man standing at the edge of a fearful precipice, while the earth is bursting open under him, is already shaking, moving, rocking for the last time, falling, drawing him into the abyss, and yet, the luckless wretch has not the strength, nor the resolution, to leap back, to avert his eyes from the yawning gulf below; the abyss draws him and at last he leaps into it of himself, himself hastening the moment of destruction.Mr. Golyadkin knew, felt and was firmly convinced that some other evil would certainly befall him on the way, that some unpleasantness would overtake him, that he would, for instance, meet his stranger once more; but—strange to say, he positively desired this meeting, considered it inevitable, and all he asked was that it might all be quickly over, that he should be relieved from his position in one way or another, but as soon as possible.And meanwhile he ran on and on, as though moved by some external force, for he felt a weakness and numbness in his whole being: he could not think of anything, though his thoughts caught at everything like brambles.A little lost dog, soaked and shivering, attached itself to Mr. Golyadkin, and ran beside him, scurrying along with tail and ears drooping, looking at him from time to time with timid comprehension.Some remote, long-forgotten idea—some memory of something that had happened long ago—came back into his mind now, kept knocking at his brain as with a hammer, vexing him and refusing to be shaken off."
"“唉，讨厌的小野狗！”戈利亚德金先生悄声说道，连他自己也不甚明白。","“Ech, that horrid little cur!” whispered Mr. Golyadkin, not understanding himself."
"最终，他在通向意大利街的拐弯处看见了那个陌生人。但这次，那个陌生人不是向他走来，而是朝和他同样的方向跑着，而且他也在跑着，就在他前面几步。最后，他们拐进了六铺街。","At last he saw his stranger at the turning into Italyansky Street.But this time the stranger was not coming to meet him, but was running in the same direction as he was, and he, too, was running, a few steps in front.At last they turned into Shestilavotchny Street."
"戈利亚德金先生气喘吁吁。那个陌生人恰好在戈利亚德金先生租住的那个公寓前停了下来。他听到了门铃声，接着，几乎就在同一时刻，传来了铁门闩的咯吱声。大门打开了，那个陌生人弯下腰，飞奔进去，消失了。几乎就在同一瞬间，戈利亚德金先生到了，像箭一般钻进了大门。他不理会发牢骚的门卫，气喘吁吁地跑进了院子里，而且立即看见了他那个有趣的伙伴，他有一会儿没看到他了。","Mr. Golyadkin caught his breath.The stranger stopped exactly before the house in which Mr. Golyadkin lodged.He heard a ring at the bell and almost at the same time the grating of the iron bolt.The gate opened, the stranger stooped, darted in and disappeared.Almost at the same instant Mr. Golyadkin reached the spot and like an arrow flew in at the gate.Heedless of the grumbling porter, he ran, gasping for breath, into the yard, and immediately saw his interesting companion, whom he had lost sight of for a moment."
"那个陌生人朝通往戈利亚德金先生寓所的楼梯处飞奔而去。戈利亚德金先生急匆匆地跟在他后面。楼梯很暗，潮湿而又肮脏。在每个拐弯处都堆满了大量公寓里的垃圾，因此任何一个对这里不熟悉的陌生人在天黑时爬这楼梯，都要冒着摔断腿的危险，来来回回非得半个小时，同时咒骂楼梯和那些住在如此不便的地方的朋友。但是，戈利亚德金先生的伙伴看上去似乎对这里很熟悉，就好像在家里似的。他轻松地爬上了楼梯，毫不费力，表现出对周围的环境十分熟悉。戈利亚德金先生勉强追上了他。其实，有一两次，那个陌生人的大衣还轻轻地碰在了他的鼻子上。他的心脏停止跳动了。那个陌生人在戈利亚德金先生寓所的门前停了下来，敲了敲门，而且（然而，这在别的时间，戈利亚德金先生肯定会觉得惊讶的）彼得鲁什卡好像坐在那里盼望似的，立即开了门，手里还拿着一支蜡烛，在那个陌生人进来时紧跟着他。我们故事的主人公冲进了就在他旁边的自己的房间里。他没有脱帽子和大衣，横过小走廊，静静地站在自己房间的门口处，好像遭雷击了似的。他所有不祥的预感都变成了真的。他担心和猜测的一切都真实地发生了。他无法呼吸了，大脑里乱糟糟的。那个陌生人也穿着大衣，带着帽子，正坐在他前面，坐在他的床上，还带着淡淡的微笑，眯着眼睛，友好地向他点头。戈利亚德金先生想大声叫喊，但是没法喊出来——想以某种方式抗议，但是力不从心。他的头发竖了起来，他恐惧得几乎要垮掉了。而这其实是有充分的理由的。他认出了自己夜里的访客。这个夜里的访客不是别人，正是他自己——是戈利亚德金先生自己，是另一个戈利亚德金先生，但又完全和他自己一样——确切地说，是人们所说的在各个方面都一摸一样的一个人……","The stranger darted towards the staircase which led to Mr. Golyadkin’s flat.Mr. Golyadkin rushed after him.The stairs were dark, damp and dirty.At every turning there were heaped-up masses of refuse from the flats, so that any unaccustomed stranger who found himself on the stairs in the dark was forced to travel to and fro for half an hour in danger of breaking his legs, cursing the stairs as well as the friends who lived in such an inconvenient place.But Mr. Golyadkin’s companion seemed as though familiar with it, as though at home; he ran up lightly, without difficulty, showing a perfect knowledge of his surroundings.Mr. Golyadkin had almost caught him up; in fact, once or twice the stranger’s coat flicked him on the nose.His heart stood still.The stranger stopped before the door of Mr. Golyadkin’s flat, knocked on it, and (which would, however, have surprised Mr. Golyadkin at any other time) Petrushka, as though he had been sitting up in expectation, opened the door at once and, with a candle in his hand, followed the strange as the latter went in.The hero of our story dashed into his lodging beside himself; without taking off his hat or coat he crossed the little passage and stood still in the doorway of his room, as though thunderstruck.All his presentiments had come true.All that he had dreaded and surmised was coming to pass in reality.His breath failed him, his head was in a whirl.The stranger, also in his coat and hat, was sitting before him on his bed, and with a faint smile, screwing up his eyes, nodded to him in a friendly way.Mr. Golyadkin wanted to scream, but could not—to protest in some way, but his strength failed him.His hair stood on end, and he almost fell down with horror.And, indeed, there was good reason.He recognised his nocturnal visitor.The nocturnal visitor was no other than himself—Mr. Golyadkin himself, another Mr. Golyadkin, but absolutely the same as himself—in fact, what is called a double in every respect..."
"第六章","CHAPTER 6"
"第二天早上八点钟，戈利亚德金先生在他的床上醒来了。前一天发生的所有非同寻常的事，那个疯狂的、令人难以置信的夜晚，连同那晚几乎不可能发生的奇遇，现如今一起浮现在他的想象中和记忆里，十分清晰。他的敌人的那样极端的、魔鬼般的恶意，尤其是对那种恶意的最终证实，把戈利亚德金先生的心都冻住了。但与此同时，一切又如此奇怪，如此不可思议，如此离奇，一切又似乎是极不可能的，因此，这整件事确实很难让人信以为真。其实，戈利亚德金先生自己都准备要承认这仅仅是匪夷所思的错觉，仅仅是幻想暂时出现了异常，仅仅是大脑发昏了，要不是幸好他从悲痛的经历中得知怨恨有时会把一个人弄到什么地步，敌人为了自己的名誉和声望，一心报复时会达到怎样残忍的程度。此外还有，戈利亚德金先生那精疲力尽的四肢、昏昏沉沉的脑袋、酸痛的腰背和恶性感冒都清晰地证明了他前一天晚上出行的可能性，并且确认了它的真实性，也多少证明了在那次出行中所发生的一切是可能的。其实，戈利亚德金先生老早就知道他们在策划着什么，而且还有别的什么人和他们是一道的。但尽管如此，他经过再三考虑后，还是下定决心保持沉默，屈服顺从，暂不反抗。","At eight o’clock next morning Mr. Golyadkin woke up in his bed.At once all the extraordinary incidents of the previous day and the wild, incredible night, with all its almost impossible adventures, presented themselves to his imagination and memory with terrifying vividness.Such intense, diabolical malice on the part of his enemies, and, above all, the final proof of that malice, froze Mr. Golyadkin’s heart.But at the same time it was all so strange, incomprehensible, wild, it seemed so impossible, that it was really hard to credit the whole business; Mr. Golyadkin was, indeed, ready to admit himself that it was all an incredible delusion, a passing aberration of the fancy, a darkening of the mind, if he had not fortunately known by bitter experience to what lengths spite will sometimes carry any one, what a pitch of ferocity an enemy may reach when he is bent on revenging his honour and prestige.Besides, Mr. Golyadkin’s exhausted limbs, his heavy head, his aching back, and the malignant cold in his head bore vivid witness to the probability of his expedition of the previous night and upheld the reality of it, and to some extent of all that had happened during that expedition.And, indeed, Mr. Golyadkin had known long, long before that something was being got up among them, that there was some one else with them.But after all, thinking it over thoroughly, he made up his mind to keep quiet, to submit and not to protest for the time."
"“他们暗中策划，或许只是想吓唬吓唬我，当他们看到我不介意、不进行反抗，而是毫不声张、温顺地忍受时，他们会停止的，他们会自然而然地放弃的，会主动放弃的。”","“They are simply plotting to frighten me, perhaps, and when they see that I don’t mind, that I make no protest, but keep perfectly quiet and put up with it meekly, they’ll give it up, they’ll give it up of themselves, give it up of their own accord.”"
"总之，戈利亚德金先生在他的床上伸着懒腰，竭力放松着疲惫的四肢，等待彼特鲁斯卡照常到他房间里来时，大脑中就浮现着这样的想法……他等了足足一刻钟。他听到那个懒鬼在屏风后摆弄着茶炊，然而却无法说服自己把他喊来。我们甚至可以说，戈利亚德金先生有点害怕面对彼特鲁斯卡。","Such, then, were the thoughts in the mind of Mr. Golyadkin as, stretching in his bed, trying to rest his exhausted limbs, he waited for Petrushka to come into his room as usual... He waited for a full quarter of an hour.He heard the lazy scamp fiddling about with the samovar behind the screen, and yet he could not bring himself to call him.We may say more: Mr. Golyadkin was a little afraid of confronting Petrushka."
"“唉，天知道，”他想，“天知道那个无赖对这一切是怎么看的。他一直不吭声，但是，他有自己的想法。”","“Why, goodness knows,” he thought, “goodness knows how that rascal looks at it all.He keeps on saying nothing, but he has his own ideas.”"
"终于，门吱嘎一声响了，彼特鲁斯卡手端茶盘走了进来。戈利亚德金先生胆怯地偷偷看了他一眼，焦急地等着会发生什么事，等着看他对某种状况会不会说些什么。但是，彼特鲁斯卡什么都没说，相反，他比平时更加沉默寡言了，更加闷闷不乐了，情绪更不好了，他皱着眉头，斜视着一切。总之，他显然对什么事非常生气，他甚至连看都没看自己的老爷一眼。顺便说一下，这使得他的老爷十分恼怒。他把端来的一切放在桌子上后，就转身走出了房间，一言未发。","At last the door creaked and Petrushka came in with a tray in his hands.Mr. Golyadkin stole a timid glance at him, impatiently waiting to see what would happen, waiting to see whether he would not say something about a certain circumstance.But Petrushka said nothing; he was, on the contrary, more silent, more glum and ill-humoured than usual; he looked askance from under his brows at everything; altogether it was evident that he was very much put out about something; he did not even once glance at his master, which, by the way, rather piqued the latter.Setting all he had brought on the table, he turned and went out of the room without a word."
"“他知道的，他知道的，他知道所有的一切，那个无赖！”戈利亚德金先生一边喝茶，一边自己嘟囔着。不过，我们的主人公什么也没问他的仆人，尽管彼特鲁斯卡之后又好几次进来他的房间里办各种各样的事。戈利亚德金先生心里非常惊慌。他害怕去办公室。他有一种强烈的预感，在那里他会发现有些事情并非“有条不紊”。","“He knows, he knows, he knows all about it, the scoundrel!”Mr. Golyadkin grumbled to himself as he took his tea.Yet out hero did not address a single question to his servant, though Petrushka came into his room several times afterwards on various errands.Mr. Golyadkin was in great trepidation of spirit.He dreaded going to the office.He had a strong presentiment that there he would find something that would not be “just so.”"
"“可以肯定，”他想，“你一去就会偶然发现什么的！耐心地忍一忍不是更好吗？目前再等一下不是更好吗？让他们在那里爱做什么就做什么吧。但是，我今天最好在这里呆会儿，恢复一下体力，让身体变好些，再更彻底地考虑一下整件事，这样，到时我就能抓住适当的时机，对他们进行攻击，就像雪花从天而降那样，而我自己则免受损害。”","“You may be sure,” he thought, “that as soon as you go you will light upon something!Isn’t it better to endure in patience?Isn’t it better to wait a bit now?Let them do what they like there; but I’d better stay here a bit today, recover my strength, get better, and think over the whole affair more thoroughly, then afterwards I could seize the right moment, fall upon them like snow from the sky, and get off scot free myself.”"
"戈利亚德金先生一边这样思索着，一边抽着烟，一根接着一根。时间过得真快。已经将近九点半了。","Reasoning like this, Mr. Golyadkin smoked pipe after pipe; time was flying.It was already nearly half-past nine."
"“哎呀，已经九点半啦，”戈利亚德金先生想着，“我去也晚了。此外，我还生病了，当然，我有病，我确实病了，这谁能否认呢？我这是怎么了嘛？如果他们派人进行调查，就让执行官来好了。说真的，我这到底是怎么了嘛？我背疼、咳嗽，又感冒了。实际上，要我出去是不可能的，在这种天气是完全不可能的。我可能会得病的，而且极有可能会死去的，尤其是如今的死亡率那么高……”","“Why, it’s half-past nine already,” thought Mr. Golyadkin; “it’s late for me to make my appearance.Besides, I’m ill, of course I’m ill, I’m certainly ill; who denies it?What’s the matter with me?If they send to make inquiries, let the executive clerk come; and, indeed, what is the matter with me really?My back aches, I have a cough, and a cold in my head; and, in fact, it’s out of the question for me to go out, utterly out of the question in such weather.I might be taken ill and, very likely, die; nowadays especially the death-rate is so high...”"
"戈利亚德金先生这样思考着，终于使自己的良心平静下来了，他为自己辩解着，反驳他料想的安德雷·菲利波维奇因玩忽职守对他的训斥。通常在这种情况下，我们的主人公特别喜欢用各种各样无可辩驳的理由在自己心目中为自己辩白，以使自己完全心安理得。所以现在，他完全安心了，便拿起烟斗，把它装满。他刚开始安逸地抽了几口，就立即蓦地从沙发上跳起来，扔掉烟斗，迅速地洗了把脸，刮好胡子，梳好头发，穿上他的制服等等，然后一把抓起些公文，飞似的去办公室了。","With such reasoning Mr. Golyadkin succeeded at last in setting his conscience at rest, and defended himself against the reprimands he expected from Andrey Filippovitch for neglect of his duty.As a rule in such cases our hero was particularly fond of justifying himself in his own eyes with all sorts of irrefutable arguments, and so completely setting his conscience at rest.And so now, having completely soothed his conscience, he took up his pipe, filled it, and had no sooner settled down comfortably to smoke, when he jumped up quickly from the sofa, flung away the pipe, briskly washed, shaved, and brushed his hair, got into his uniform and so on, snatched up some papers, and flew to the office."
"戈利亚德金先生胆怯地走进自己的部门，战战兢兢地期待有什么不愉快的事情——这种期待是模糊的、无意识的，所以仍然也是令人不快的。他怯生生地在自己那紧挨着首席办事员安东·安东诺维奇·谢托奇金的老位置上坐下。他没有看任何东西，也没有让自己分神，就投入到了放在他面前的公文的内容中。他下定决心并对自己发誓要尽量避免一切挑衅性的东西，一切可能让他妥协的东西，比如鲁莽的问题、玩笑，或对前一天晚上发生的所有事情的无礼暗示，他还下定决心要回避与同僚们的寒暄，诸如问候健康之类的。但很显然，没法，也不可能坚持这样。对周围令人讨厌的任何事情的担心和忧虑常常远比烦恼本身更让他担忧。这就是为什么尽管他已经从内心发誓无论发生什么，都要避免介入任何事，要对一切无动于衷。但戈利亚德金先生还是会时不时偷偷地、悄悄地抬起头，偷偷摸摸地左顾右盼，偷看自己同僚的面容，还设法猜测在他们中间有没有发生什么新的、特别的事与自己有关，而他们不怀好意，没有告诉他。他认为昨天发生的一切和现在他周围的一切肯定有关系。终于，在痛苦中，他开始期盼发生点什么——天知道是什么——来结束这一切——即使是某种灾祸——他也不在乎。就在这时，命运攫住了戈利亚德金先生：他刚刚产生这种渴望，他的疑虑就以一种奇怪的、最出乎意料的方式解决了。","Mr. Golyadkin went into his department timidly, in quivering expectation of something unpleasant—an expectation which was none the less disagreeable for being vague and unconscious; he sat timidly down in his invariable place next the head clerk, Anton Antonovitch Syetotchkin.Without looking at anything or allowing his attention to be distracted, he plunged into the contents of the papers that lay before him.He made up his mind and vowed to himself to avoid, as far as possible, anything provocative, anything that might compromise him, such as indiscreet questions, jests, or unseemly allusions to any incidents of the previous evening; he made up his mind also to abstain from the usual interchange of civilities with his colleagues, such as inquiries after health and such like.But evidently it was impossible, out of the question, to keep to this.Anxiety and uneasiness in regard to anything near him that was annoying always worried him far more than the annoyance itself.And that was why, in spite of his inward vows to refrain from entering into anything, whatever happened, and to keep aloof from everything, Mr. Golyadkin from time to time, on the sly, very, very quietly, raised his head and stealthily looked about him to right and to left, peeped at the countenances of his colleagues, and tried to gather whether there were not something new and particular in them referring to himself and with sinister motives concealed from him.He assumed that there must be a connection between all that had happened yesterday and all that surrounded him now.At last, in his misery, he began to long for something—goodness knows what—to happen to put an end to it—even some calamity—he did not care.At this point destiny caught Mr. Golyadkin: he had hardly felt this desire when his doubts were solved in the strange and most unexpected manner."
"隔壁房间的门突然发出轻轻的、胆怯的吱嘎声，似乎暗示要进来的那个人很微不足道。接着，戈利亚德金先生非常熟悉的一个身影羞怯地站在我们的主人公就座的那张桌子前。我们的主人公没有抬头——不，他只是偷偷看了他一眼，微微地瞥了一眼，但是，他就了解到了一切，明白了一切，直至每一个细节。他羞愧得满脸发热，把自己那忠诚的脑袋埋在了公文中，抱着和一只被猎人追捕的鸵鸟把自己的脑袋藏进热砂里时完全相同的目的。新来的那个人向安德雷·菲利波维奇鞠了个躬，随即他听到了客气的带有优越感的官腔声，这是所有上司在办公室里对其下属说话时的口吻。","The door leading from the next room suddenly gave a soft and timid creak, as though to indicate that the person about to enter was a very unimportant one, and a figure, very familiar to Mr. Golyadkin, stood shyly before the very table at which our hero was seated.The latter did not raise his head—no, he only stole a glance at him, the tiniest glance; but he knew all, he understood all, to every detail.He grew hot with shame, and buried his devoted head in his papers with precisely the same object with which the ostrich, pursued by hunters, hides his head in the burning sand.The new arrival bowed to Andrey Filippovitch, and thereupon he heard a voice speaking in the regulation tone of condescending tone of politeness with which all persons in authority address their subordinates in public offices."
"“坐吧。”安德雷·菲利波维奇说道，示意新来的人到安东·安东诺维奇的桌子那里，“就这里，戈利亚德金先生的对面，我们很快会给你一些事情去做的。”","“Take a seat here.” said Andrey Filippovitch, motioning the newcomer to Anton Antonovitch’s table.“Here, opposite Mr. Golyadkin, and we’ll soon give you something to do.”"
"最后，安德雷·菲利波维奇很快地做了个手势，有礼貌地告诫新来者他的职责，接着，他就立即去专心地研究在他面前放成一堆的公文了。","Andrey Filippovitch ended by making a rapid gesture that decorously admonished the newcomer of his duty, and then he immediately became engrossed in the study of the papers that lay in a heap before him."
"戈利亚德金先生终于抬起了眼睛，而他之所以没有晕倒只是因为他从一开始就已经预料到了这一切，他从一开始就被预先警告过了，在心里猜到了这个陌生人是谁。戈利亚德金先生的第一个动作就是迅速地朝四周看了看，看看有没有人在窃窃私语，有没有人在拿这件事说办公室常见的笑话，有没有什么人因惊讶而张大了嘴，甚至有没有什么人因惊恐而跌倒在了桌子底下。但令他非常吃惊的是，没有任何此类的迹象。他的同僚和伙伴的行为使他感到吃惊。这似乎有悖常规。戈利亚德金先生绝对被这异乎寻常的沉默吓了一跳。事实不言而喻，这是件奇怪、令人震惊、不可思议的事情。它足以唤醒任何人。当然，所有这一切只不过很快地在戈利亚德金先生的脑海中一闪而过。他感觉自己好像在慢火中煎熬着。其实，那够让他煎熬了。现在坐在戈利亚德金先生对面的那个身影就是他的恐惧，是他的耻辱，是他前一天晚上的噩梦，总之，就是戈利亚德金先生自己，不是那个现在坐在自己的椅子上，张着大嘴，手里拿着笔一动不动的戈利亚德金先生，不是那个担任副主任的戈利亚德金先生，不是那个喜欢埋没自己、爱在人群中躲躲闪闪的戈利亚德金先生，不是那个戈利亚德金先生，他的行为清楚地表明“别碰我，而我也不会碰你的”，或者，“别妨碍我，你看，我没有碰你”。不，这是另一个戈利亚德金先生，和第一个全然不同，然而与此同时，又极其相像——一样的身高，一样的身材，一样的衣服，都是秃顶，实际上，没有任何，绝对没有任何不像的地方，因此，如果让他们并排在一起，没有人，绝对没有人保证会区分出哪个是真正的戈利亚德金先生而哪个是新的，哪个是原来的而哪个是复制品。","Mr. Golyadkin lifted his eyes at last, and that he did not fall into a swoon was simply because he had foreseen it all from the first, that he had been forewarned from the first, guessing in his soul who the stranger was.Mr. Golyadkin’s first movement was to look quickly about him, to see whether there were any whispering, any office joke being cracked on the subject, whether any one’s face was agape with wonder, whether, indeed, some one had not fallen under the table from terror.But to his intense astonishment there was no sign of anything of the sort.The behaviour of his colleagues and companions surprised him.It seemed contrary to the dictates of common sense.Mr. Golyadkin was positively scared at this extraordinary reticence.The fact spoke for itself; it was a strange, horrible, uncanny thing.It was enough to rouse any one.All this, of course, only passed rapidly through Mr. Golyadkin’s mind.He felt as though he were burning in a slow fire.And, indeed, there was enough to make him.The figure that was sitting opposite Mr. Golyadkin now was his terror, was his shame, was his nightmare of the evening before; in short, was Mr. Golyadkin himself, not the Mr. Golyadkin who was sitting now in his chair with his mouth wide open and his pen petrified in his hand, not the one who acted as assistant to his chief, not the one who liked to efface himself and slink away in the crowd, not the one whose deportment plainly said, “Don’t touch me and I won’t touch you,” or, “Don’t interfere with me, you see I’m not touching you”; no, this was another Mr. Golyadkin, quite different, yet at the same time, exactly like the first—the same height, the same figure, the same clothes, the same baldness; in fact, nothing, absolutely nothing, was lacking to complete the likeness, so that if one were to set them side by side, nobody, absolutely nobody, could have undertaken to distinguish which was the real Mr. Golyadkin and which was the new one, which was the original and which was the copy."
"我们的主人公——如果可以这样打比方的话——正处于这样的境况：一个恶作剧的人为了开玩笑，正偷偷地拿聚光镜照着他。","Our hero was—if the comparison can be made—in the position of a man upon whom some practical joker has stealthily, by way of jest, turned a burning glass."
"“这是什么意思呀？是一个梦吗？”他想，“这是真实的，还是昨天发生的事情的延续呢？还有，凭什么发生这一切啊？谁批准了这样的一位职员，这是谁授权的呢？我睡着了呢，还是在做白日梦？","“What does it mean?Is it a dream?” he wondered.“Is it reality or the continuation of what happened yesterday?And besides, by what right is this all being done?Who sanctioned such a clerk, who authorized this?Am I asleep, am I in a waking dream?”"
"戈利亚德金先生试着拧了自己一下，甚至努力鼓足勇气去掐别的什么人……不，这不是梦，就是这样。戈利亚德金先生感到大汗淋漓，他觉得发生在自己身上的一切不可思议、闻所未闻，而正是这个原因使得这件事完全不成体统，因为戈利亚德金先生意识并感觉到了成为这一滑稽奇遇中的先例是多么的不利。他甚至开始怀疑自己的存在，虽然他已经为任何事做好了准备，并希望用任何方式来解决自己的疑虑，然而，现实情况的出其不意还是让人很震惊。他的痛苦悲惨而又无法抗拒。有时，他会完全丧失思考力和记忆力。这样一瞬间之后，他恢复了常态，发现自己正机械地、毫无意识地在公文上写着什么。他对自己不放心，开始查阅自己写了些什么——但一点也看不懂。最后，一直谨慎地、彬彬有礼地坐在桌子旁的另一个戈利亚德金先生站起来，穿过另一个房间的门，不见了。戈利亚德金先生向四周环顾了一下——一切都很安静，他只听到笔的刷刷声、翻阅公文的沙沙声和离安德雷·菲利波维奇的座位最远的角落里的谈话声。戈利亚德金先生看了看安东·安东诺维奇，极有可能是因为我们主人公的面容完全反映出了他的真实处境，并且与整个状况相一致，因而，就某一点来看，非常引人注目吧，和蔼可亲的安东·安东诺维奇放下笔，带着明显的同情问候了他的健康。","Mr. Golyadkin tried pinching himself, even tried to screw up his courage to pinch some one else... No, it was not a dream and that was all about it.Mr. Golyadkin felt that the sweat was trickling down him in big drops; he felt that what was happening to him was something incredible, unheard of, and for that very reason was, to complete his misery, utterly unseemly, for Mr. Golyadkin realized and felt how disadvantageous it was to be the first example of such a burlesque adventure.He even began to doubt his own existence, and though he was prepared for anything and had been longing for his doubts to be settled in any way whatever, yet the actual reality was startling in its unexpectedness.His misery was poignant and overwhelming.At times he lost all power of thought and memory.Coming to himself after such a moment, he noticed that he was mechanically and unconsciously moving the pen over the paper.Mistrustful of himself, he began going over what he had written—and could make nothing of it.At last the other Mr. Golyadkin, who had been sitting discreetly and decorously at the table, got up and disappeared through the door into the other room.Mr. Golyadkin looked around—everything was quiet; he heard nothing but the scratching of pens, the rustle of turning over pages, and conversation in the corners furthest from Andrey Filippovitch’s seat.Mr. Golyadkin looked at Anton Antonovitch, and as, in all probability, our hero’s countenance fully reflected his real condition and harmonized with the whole position, and was consequently, from one point of view, very remarkable, good-natured Anton Antonovitch, laying aside his pen, inquired after his health with marked sympathy."
"“我很好，感谢上帝，安东·安东诺维奇。”戈利亚德金先生结结巴巴地说。“我非常健康，安东·安东诺维奇。我现在很好，安东·安东诺维奇。”他迟疑地加了一句，还不是完全信任他时常提起的这个安东·安东诺维奇。","“I’m very well, thank God, Anton Antonovitch,” said Mr. Golyadkin, stammering.“I am perfectly well, Anton Antonovitch.I am all right now, Anton Antonovitch,” he added uncertainly, not yet fully trusting Anton Antonovitch, whose name he had mentioned so often."
"“我还以为你不太舒服呢，不过那并不奇怪，不，真的！尤其是如今有那么多的流行病。你知道吗……”","“I fancied you were not quite well: though that’s not to be wondered at; no, indeed!Nowadays especially there’s such a lot of illness going about.Do you know...”"
"“是啊，安东·安东诺维奇，我知道有那么多的病……我不是那个意思，安东·安东诺维奇。”戈利亚德金先生目不转睛地看着安东·安东诺维奇，接着说道。“你明白，安东·安东诺维奇，我甚至还不知道你怎么，也就是说，我的意思是，要怎么着手处理这件事，安东·安东诺维奇……”","“Yes, Anton Antonovitch, I know there is such a lot of illness... I did not mean that, Anton Antonovitch,” Mr. Golyadkin went on, looking intently at Anton Antonovitch.“You see, Anton Antonovitch, I don’t even know how you, that is, I mean to say, how to approach this matter, Anton Antonovitch...”"
"“怎么会这样？我真的……你知道吗……我必须承认我不是很明白。你必须……你必须说明一下，你也清楚，你在哪方面有困难。”安东·安东诺维奇说道。他看到戈利亚德金先生的眼睛里居然含着泪花，自己也开始陷入了困境。","“How so?I really... do you know... I must confess I don’t quite understand; you must ... you must explain, you know, in what way you are in difficulties,” said Anton Antonovitch, beginning to be in difficulties himself, seeing that there were actually tears in Mr. Golyadkin’s eyes."
"“真的，安东·安东诺维奇……我……这里……这里有一个职员，安东·安东诺维奇……”","“Really, Anton Antonovitch... I... here... there’s a clerk here, Anton Antonovitch...”"
"""唉！我现在还是不明白。”","“Well! I don’t understand now.”"
"“我是说，安东·安东诺维奇，这里有一个新职员。”","“I mean to say, Anton Antonovitch, there’s a new clerk here.”"
"“是的，有啊，和你同名。”","“Yes, there is; a namesake of yours.”"
"“什么？”戈利亚德金先生叫了起来。","“What?” cried Mr. Golyadkin."
"“我说跟你同名，他的名字也是戈利亚德金。他不是你的一个兄弟吗？”","“I say a namesake of yours; his name’s Golyadkin too.Isn’t he a brother of yours?”"
"“不，安东·安东诺维奇，我……”","“No, Anton Antonovitch, I...”"
"“唔！你是没这样说！嗨，我原以为他一定是你的亲戚呢。你知道吗，他和你长得有点像。”","“H’m!you don’t say so!Why, I thought he must be a relation of yours.Do you know, there’s a sort of family likeness.”"
"戈利亚德金先生惊呆了，一时无语。这样一件令人震惊的、前所未有的事，一件以其特有的方式、无可否认地罕见又稀奇的事，一件甚至能使毫不在意的旁观者也惊愕的事，竟说的如此轻巧，说长得像家人，可他却能像在镜子里那样看到自己！","Mr. Golyadkin was petrified with astonishment, and for the moment he could not speak.To treat so lightly such a horrible, unheard-of thing, a thing undeniably rare and curious in its way, a thing which would have amazed even an unconcerned spectator, to talk of a family resemblance when he could see himself as in a looking-glass!"
"“雅科夫·彼得罗维奇，知道我会劝你做什么吗？”安东·安东诺维奇接着说，“去向医生咨询一下。知道吗，不知为什么，你看上去很不好。你的眼睛看起来有点异常……你知道，有一种奇怪的神色在里面。”","“Do you know, Yakov Petrovitch, what I advise you to do?”Anton Antonovitch went on.“Go and consult a doctor.Do you know, you look somehow quite unwell.You eyes look peculiar... you know, there’s a peculiar expression in them.”"
"“不，安东·安东诺维奇，我觉得，当然……也就是说，我一直想打听一下这个职员。”","“No, Anton Antonovitch, I feel, of course... that is, I keep wanting to ask about this clerk.”"
"“嗯？”","“Well?”"
"“也就是说，难道你没注意过吗，安东·安东诺维奇，一些关于他的奇怪的事，一些非常引人注目的事？”","“That is, have not you noticed, Anton Antonovitch, something peculiar about him, something very marked?”"
"“是什么？”","“That is... ?”"
"“换句话说，我的意思是，安东·安东诺维奇，比如说，和某个人惊人地相像，比如说和我？要知道，你刚才也说过，安东·安东诺维奇，长得酷似家人。你无意中说出了那句话……你也清楚，有时双胞胎真的完全相像，就像两滴水那样，因此人们无法区分开来。好啦，那就是我要说的。”","“That is, I mean, Anton Antonovitch, a striking likeness with somebody, for instance; with me, for instance?You spoke just now, you see, Anton Antonovitch, of a family likeness.You let slip the remark...You know there really are sometimes twins exactly alike, like two drops of water, so that they can’t be told apart.Well, it’s that that I mean.”"
"“的确，”安东·安东诺维奇沉思了片刻后说道，好像他第一次发现了这个事实，“嗯，确实是的！你说的没错，确实有惊人的相似之处，你说的完全正确。你们真的有可能被误认作彼此。”他继续说道，眼睛瞪得越来越大，“而且，你知道吗，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇，那绝对是一种惊人的相像，太难以置信了，其实就像俗语说的那样，也就是说，正和你一模一样……你没发现吗，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇？我还想请你解释一下呢。真的，我必须承认，一开始我并没有特别注意。太奇妙了，真的太奇妙了！而且，你也清楚，你不是这里的本地人，是吗，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇？”","“To be sure,” said Anton Antonovitch, after a moment’s thought, speaking as though he were struck by the fact for the first time: “yes, indeed!You are right, there is a striking likeness, and you are quite right in what you say.You really might be mistaken for one another,” he went on, opening his eyes wider and wider; “and, do you know, Yakov Petrovitch, it’s positively a marvellous likeness, fantastic, in fact, as the saying is; that is, just as you ... Have you observed, Yakov Petrovitch?I wanted to ask you to explain it; yes, I must confess I didn’t take particular notice at first.It’s wonderful, it’s really wonderful!And, you know, you are not a native of these parts, are you, Yakov Petrovitch?”"
"“不是的。”","“No.”"
"“要知道，他也不是本地人。说不定他还和你来自同一个地方呢。我斗胆问一下，你母亲大部分时候都住在哪里呀？”","“He is not from these parts, you know, either.Perhaps he comes from the same part of the country as you do.Where, may I make bold to inquire, did your mother live for the most part?”"
"“你说过……你说，安东·安东诺维奇，他不是本地人？”","“You said ... you say, Anton Antonovitch, that he is not a native of these parts?”"
"“是的，他不是。而且真的好奇怪啊！”多嘴的安东·安东诺维奇继续说着，对他来说，说长道短是一大真正的乐趣。“这也会激发好奇心的。不过，你也清楚，你也可能从他旁边经过，和他擦肩而过，而没有注意到任何东西。但是，你也不必因此而沮丧。这事确实是发生了。你知道吗，我得告诉你，同样的事发生在了我姨妈身上，她在死之前看到了和自己一模一样的人……”","“No, he is not.And indeed how strange it is!” continued the talkative Anton Antonovitch, for whom it was a genuine treat to gossip.“It may well arouse curiosity; and yet, you know, you might pass him by, brush against him, without noticing anything.But you mustn’t be upset about it.It’s a thing that does happen.Do you know, the same thing, I must tell you, happened to my aunt on my mother’s side; she saw her own double before her death ...”"
"“不，我——不好意思，我打断一下，安东·安东诺维奇——我想搞明白，安东·安东诺维奇，那个职员是怎么……也就是说，他在这里是什么身份呢？”","“No, I—excuse me for interrupting you, Anton Antonovitch—I wanted to find out, Anton Antonovitch, how that clerk... that is, on what footing is he here?”"
"“代替谢苗·伊万诺维奇，替补他死后的空缺。那个职位空着，所以任命了他。知道吗，我听说谢苗·伊万诺维奇留下了三个孩子，都还很小。他的遗孀还跪在了阁下大人的脚下。他们还说她在隐瞒一些事情，她得到了一笔钱，但是把它藏了起来。”","“In the place of Semyon Ivanovitch, to fill the vacancy left by his death; the post was vacant, so he was appointed.Do you know, I’m told poor Semyon Ivanovitch left three children, all tiny dots.The widow fell at the feet of his Excellency.They do say she’s hiding something; she’s got a bit of money, but she’s hiding it.”"
"“不，安东·安东诺维奇，我仍然在说那件事。”","“No, Anton Antonovitch, I was still referring to that circumstance.”"
"“你是说……？确实！但是，你为什么对那个这么感兴趣呀？我告诉过你，不要让自己烦恼。这一切在某种程度上都只是暂时的。哎呀，毕竟，你也清楚，你和这没有关系的。因此，这是全能的上帝注定的，是上帝的意愿，埋怨是有罪的。上帝的智慧在其中是显而易见的。在我看来，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇，不管怎样，你都不该受责备。世界上有各种各样奇怪的事！大自然母亲对她的馈赠是慷慨的，你不会被召来对这负责的，你不用承担责任。嘿，比如说，我希望你听说过那些——他们的名字是什么来着？——哦，暹罗双胞胎，他们的背连在一起，生活、吃饭和睡觉都在一起。我听说他们赚了许多钱。”","“You mean...?To be sure!But why are you so interested in that?I tell you not to upset yourself.All this is temporary to some extent.Why, after all, you know, you have nothing to do with it.So it has been ordained by God Almighty, it’s His will, and it is sinful repining.His wisdom is apparent in it.And as far as I can make out, Yakov Petrovitch, you are not to blame in any way.There are all sorts of strange things in the world!Mother Nature is liberal with her gifts, and you are not called upon to answer for it, you won’t be responsible.Here, for instance, you have heard, I expect, of those—what’s their name?—oh, the Siamese twins who are joined together at the back, live and eat and sleep together.I’m told they get a lot of money.”"
"“对不起，安东·安东诺维奇……”","“Allow me, Anton Antonovitch...”"
"“我明白，我明白！真的！但那有什么啊？没关系的，我告诉你，在我看来，根本没什么事可以让你自己苦恼的。毕竟，他是一个职员——作为一个职员，他似乎是个很有能力的人。他说他叫戈利亚德金，不是这一地区的本地人，是一个九品文官。他个人和阁下大人进行了面谈。”","“I understand, I understand!Yes!But what of it?It’s no matter, I tell you, ad far as I can see there’s nothing for you to upset yourself about.After all, he’s a clerk—as a clerk he seems to be a capable man.He says his name is Golyadkin, that he’s not a native of this district, and that he’s a titular councillor.He had a personal interview with his Excellency.”"
"“那阁下大人怎么……？”","“And how did his Excellency...?”"
"“没什么。我听说他做了一个令人满意的自我描述，还说明了原因，说，‘是这样的，阁下大人，’他没有钱，希望找点事做，尤其是能在阁下大人手下任职而深感荣幸……这一切都很得体，你也清楚。他把自己的意思表达得简洁明了。他一定是个理智的人。不过，当然，他是被推荐来的，不然，他是不可能进来的……”","“It was all right; I am told he gave a satisfactory account of himself, gave his reasons, said, ‘It’s like this, your Excellency,’ and that he was without means and anxious to enter the service, and would be particularly flattered to be serving under his Excellency ... all that was proper, you know; he expressed himself neatly.He must be a sensible man. But of course he came with a recommendation; he couldn’t have got in without that ...”"
"“噢，谁推荐来的呢……也就是说，我的意思是，究竟是谁插手了这种可耻的事？”","“Oh, from whom... that is, I mean, who is it has had a hand in this shameful business?”"
"“真的，我听说是一份很有来头的推荐信。我听说阁下大人和安德雷·菲利波维奇都笑了。”","“Yes, a good recommendation, I’m told; his Excellency, I’m told laughed with Andrey Filippovitch.”"
"“和安德雷·菲利波维奇笑了？”","“Laughed with Andrey Filippovitch?”"
"“是的，他只是微笑了一下，说行，他没什么好反对的，只要他尽职尽责……”","“Yes, he only just smiled and said that it was all right, and that he had nothing against it, so long as he did his duty...”"
"“哦，还有呢？你多少让我感到轻松了一点，安东·安东诺维奇，继续说下去，求你了。”","“Well, and what more?You relieve me to some extent, Anton Antonovitch; go on, I entreat you.”"
"“不好意思，我必须再次告诉你……那么，好吧，得了，没什么，这只是很简单的一件事。我告诉你，你不必使自己烦恼，那没什么可疑的……”","“Excuse me, I must tell you again... Well, then, come, it’s nothing, it’s a very simple matter; you mustn’t upset yourself, I tell you, and there’s nothing suspicious about it...”"
"""不。我……也就是说，安东·安东诺维奇，我想问问你，阁下大人还说别的什么了吗……比如说，关于我？”","“No. I... that is, Anton Antonovitch, I want to ask you, didn’t his Excellency say anything more... about me, for instance?”"
"“嗨！当然！没有，没有那样的事，你可以完全放心啦。当然，你也知道这件事非常引人注目，而起初……为何，嘿，比如说我吧，我简直就没注意到它呢。我真的不知道为何直到你提起后才注意到它。不过，你完全可以放心。他没说什么特别的，确实没什么。”和蔼可亲的安东·安东诺维奇加了一句，从他的椅子上站了起来。","“Well!To be sure!No, nothing of the sort; you can set your mind quite at rest.You know it is, of course, a rather striking circumstance, and at first... why, here, I, for instance, I scarcely noticed it.I really don’t know why I didn’t notice it till you mentioned it.But you can set your mind at rest entirely.He said nothing particular, absolutely nothing,” added good-natured Anton Antonovitch, getting up from his chair."
"“那么，安东·安东诺维奇，我……”","“So then, Anton, Antonovitch, I...”"
"“哦，请你原谅。我尽在这里对这些琐事说三道四了，我还有件要紧的事。我必须查询一下。”","“Oh, you must excuse me.Here I’ve been gossiping about these trivial matters, and I’ve business that is important and urgent.I must inquire about it.”"
"“安东·安东诺维奇！”安德雷·伊万诺维奇客气地召唤他，“阁下大人找你。”","“Anton Antonovitch!”Andrey Filippovitch’s voice sounded, summoning him politely, “his Excellency has been asking for you.”"
"“马上，我马上就来，安德雷·伊万诺维奇。”安东·安东诺维奇拿起一叠公文，先飞快地离开，去了安德雷·伊万诺维奇那里，然后进了阁下大人的房间。","“This minute, I’m coming this minute, Andrey Filippovitch.”And Anton Antonovitch, taking a pile of papers, flew off first to Andrey Filippovitch and then into his Excellency’s room."
"“那又是什么意思呢？”戈利亚德金先生想，“难道这里有什么花招吗？所以，现在刮的是那阵风……那正好。那么，事情是在朝令人更加愉快的方向发展了。”我们的主人公自言自语道，搓着双手，高兴得差点忘乎所以了。“那么，我们的状况是件普通的事了。那么，原来都是胡说八道的，根本就没发生什么。事实上，谁都没做什么，他们都没动，那帮无赖，他们正坐着，忙自己的工作呢，那太好了，好极了！我喜欢这个和蔼可亲的家伙，我一直就喜欢他，还愿意尊敬他……尽管有人肯定会说不知道在想什么呢。这个安东·安东诺维奇……我不敢相信他，他满头白发，而且变得颤巍巍了。阁下大人没说什么，真是太好了，就这样吧！这真是太好了！我赞同！只是为什么安德雷·伊万诺维奇要咧嘴一笑，横加干涉呢？这和他有什么关系呢？那个老无赖，经常挡我的道，就像一只黑猫，老想在人前跑过，常常阻止人们和惹人生气，常常把人惹恼并阻挠人们……”","“Then what is the meaning of it?” thought Mr. Golyadkin.“Is there some sort of game going on?So the wind’s in that quarter now ... That’s just as well; so things have taken a much pleasanter turn,” our hero said to himself, rubbing his hands, and so delighted that he scarcely knew where he was.“So our position is an ordinary thing.So it turns out to be all nonsense, it comes to nothing at all.No one has done anything really, and they are not budging, the rascals, they are sitting busy over their work; that’s splendid, splendid!I like the good-natured fellow, I’ve always liked him, and I’m always ready to respect him ... though it must be said one doesn’t know what to think; this Anton Antonovitch ... I’m afraid to trust him; his hair’s grey, and he’s getting shaky.It’s an immense and glorious thing that his Excellency said nothing, and let it pass!It’s a good thing!I approve!Only why does Andrey Filippovitch interfere with his grins?What’s he got to do with it?The old rogue.Always on my track, always, like a black cat, on the watch to run across a man’s path, always thwarting and annoying a man, always annoying and thwarting a man...”"
"戈利亚德金先生又向四周看了看，又恢复了希望。不过，他还是为一个遥远的想法、一个令人不快的想法而感到担忧。他甚至想到他可以以某种方式设法去巴结那些职员，甚至成为圈子里的第一人（或许在离开办公室时，或者假装因自己的工作而走到他们面前），在交谈中露点口风，说，“就是那样的，长得惊人地相像，各位，一件很奇怪的事，一个滑稽的闹剧！”——也就是说，把这件事轻轻带过，以这种方式测一下危险的深度。“恶魔在平静的水域中繁殖。”我们的主人公从内心断定。","Mr. Golyadkin looked around him again, and again his hopes revived.Yet he felt that he was troubled by one remote idea, an unpleasant idea.It even occurred to him that he might try somehow to make up to the clerks, to be the first in the field even (perhaps when leaving the office or going up to them as though about his work), to drop a hint in the course of conversation, saying, “This is how it is, what a striking likeness, gentlemen, a strange circumstance, a burlesque farce!”—that is, treat it all lightly, and in this way sound the depth of the danger.“Devils breed in still waters,” our hero concluded inwardly."
"然而，戈利亚德金先生只是这样考虑了一下，他立即就想到了更好的。他意识到这样太过头了。“那就是你的性格。”他自言自语着，轻轻地拍了拍自己的脑门，“你一得到什么东西，就会很高兴！你也太头脑简单了！不，你和我最好耐心点，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇，让我们耐心地等等。”","Mr. Golyadkin, however, only contemplated this; he thought better of it in time.He realized that this would be going too far.“That’s your temperament,” he said to himself, tapping himself lightly on the forehead; “as soon as you gain anything you are delighted!You’re a simple soul!No, you and I had better be patient, Yakov Petrovitch; let us wait and be patient!”"
"不过，就像我们已经说过的那样，戈利亚德金先生满怀希望，又振作起来了，感觉自己似乎死而复生了。","Nevertheless, as we have mentioned already, Mr. Golyadkin was buoyed up with the most confident hopes, feeling as though he had risen from the dead."
"“没关系的。”他想道，“这好比搬掉了压在胸口的那一百吨重的石头！无疑，就是这样的！盒子盖打开了。克雷洛夫是对的，一个聪明的家伙，一个无赖，那个克雷洛夫，一个伟大的寓言故事家！至于他，让他在办公室工作吧，祝他好运，只要他不管闲事，不妨碍别人。让他在办公室工作——我同意并赞成！”","“No matter,” he thought, “it’s as though a hundred tons had been lifted off my chest!Here is a circumstance, to be sure!The box has been opened by the lid.Krylov is right, a clever chap, a rogue, that Krylov, and a great fable-write!And as for him, let him work in the office, and good luck to him so long as he doesn’t meddle or interfere with any one; let him work in the office—I consent and approve!”"
"这时，时间过去了，飞快地过去了，不知不觉敲响了四点。办公室关门了。安德雷·伊万诺维奇拿起了帽子，所有人在一定的时候都学他那样。戈利亚德金先生故意磨蹭了一会儿，直到其他所有人都风道扬镖后才最后一个走出去。走在街上，他感觉自己好像在天堂里，因此，他甚至想走得更长一些，想沿着涅瓦大街走走。","Meanwhile the hours were passing, flying by, and before he noticed the time it struck four.The office was closed.Andrey Filippovitch took his hat, and all followed his example in due course.Mr. Golyadkin dawdled a little on purpose, long enough to be the last to go out when all the others had gone their several ways.Going out from the street he felt as though he were in Paradise, so that he even felt inclined to go a longer way round, and to walk along the Nevsky Prospect."
"“无疑这就是命运。”我们的主人公想，“事情有了出乎意料的转机。天气更令人愉快了，又是严寒，又是小雪橇。严寒适合俄罗斯人，俄罗斯人与严寒相处极佳。我喜欢俄罗斯人。可爱的雪花，又是秋之初雪，运动员会说，‘能在初雪中去逮野兔就太好了。’哎呀，得啦，没关系的。”","“To be sure this is destiny,” thought our hero, “this unexpected turn in affairs.And the weather’s more cheerful, and the frost and the little sledges.And the frost suits the Russian, the Russian gets on capitally with the frost.I like the Russian.And the dear little snow, and the first few flakes in autumn; the sportsman would say, ‘It would be nice to go shooting hares in the first snow.’Well, there, it doesn’t matter.”"
"戈利亚德金先生这样表达着自己的激情。然而，有什么东西在他的脑海中烦扰着他，也不全然是忧郁，但偶尔他的心头也会有这样的苦恼，使他不知如何解脱。","This was how Mr. Golyadkin’s enthusiasm found expression.Yet something was fretting in his brain, not exactly melancholy, but at times he had such a gnawing at his heart that he did not know how to find relief."
"“不过，让我们等等那一天吧，到时我们会深感欢喜的。而且，毕竟，你也清楚，这有什么关系呢？得啦，让我们再考虑一下，让我们再看看吧。好啦，让我们再考虑考虑，我年轻的朋友，让我们再细细想想。哎呀，首先，一个人和你十分相似，完全一样。嗨，那有什么呢？如果有这么一个人，为何我就该因此而悲伤哭泣呢？那和我有什么关系呢？我站到一边，对我自己吹口哨，就是这样的！那就是我自己所处的易受损害的境地，就是那样的！让他在办公室工作吧！嗨，据说那暹罗双胞胎真是太奇怪，太了不起了……但是，为什么要让暹罗双胞胎参与呢？他们自然是双胞胎，不过，要知道，即使是伟人，有时看起来也好像是怪人。其实，我们从历史上得知著名的苏沃罗夫过去像公鸡那样啼叫过……但是，在那一点上，他做那一切是出于政治目的。他是个伟大的将军……然而，尽管如此，将军又怎么啦？可是，我不与人来往，就是这样的，我不管别的其他人，我是无辜的，我鄙视我的敌人。我不是个搞阴谋诡计的人，我为此感到自豪。我慈祥温柔、坦诚率直，干净利落而和蔼友好，谦逊而随和。”","“Let us wait for the day, though, and then we shall rejoice.And, after all, you know, what does it matter?Come, let us think it over, let us look at it.Come, let us consider it, my young friend, let us consider it.Why, a man’s exactly like you in the first place, absolutely the same.Well, what is there in that?If there is such a man, why should I weep over it?What is it to me?I stand aside, I whistle to myself, and that’s all!That’s what I laid myself open to, and that’s all about it!Let him work in the office!Well, it’s strange and marvellous, they say, that the Siamese twins... But why bring in Siamese twins?They are twins, of course, but even great men, you know, sometimes look queer creatures.In fact, we know from history that the famous Suvorov used to crow like a cock... But there, he did all that with political motives; and he was a great general... but what are generals, after all?But I keep myself to myself, that’s all, and I don’t care about any one else, and, secure in my innocence, I scorn my enemies.I am not one to intrigue, and I’m proud of it.Gentle, straightforward, neat and nice, meek and mild.”"
"突然，戈利亚德金先生停下不说了，他的舌头打结了，他开始像片树叶那样发颤，他甚至还闭了一下眼睛。不过，他希望使他感到恐惧的那个人只是个错觉，他最终睁开眼睛，胆怯地向右边偷偷看了一下。不，那不是错觉！……他那天上午认识的那个人正在他旁边向前走着，微笑着，偷偷地看着他的脸，而且，显然在寻找机会要开始和他交谈。不过，这交谈还是没有开始。他们俩就像这样走了大约五十步。戈利亚德金先生把所有气力都集中在把自己包裹起来，藏在自己的大衣里，尽可能地拉下帽子，扣在眼睛上。更难堪的是，他同伴的大衣和帽子看起来就好像是从戈利亚德金先生自己身上脱下来的一样。","All at once Mr. Golyadkin broke off, his tongue failed him and he began trembling like a leaf; he even closed his eyes for a minute.Hoping, however, that the object of his terror was only an illusion, he opened his eyes at last and stole a timid glance to the right.No, it was not an illusion!... His acquaintance of that morning was tripping along by his side, smiling, peeping into his face, and apparently seeking an opportunity to begin a conversation with him.The conversation was not begun, however.They both walked like this for about fifty paces.All Mr. Golyadkin’s efforts were concentrated on muffling himself up, hiding himself in his coat and pulling his hat down as far as possible over his eyes.To complete his mortification, his companion’s coat and hat looked as though they had been taken off Mr. Golyadkin himself."
"“先生，”我们的主人公最后说，声音差不多像耳语，而且没有看他的同伴，“我们不是同路吧，我想……其实，我确信是这样的。”他停顿了一下，最后说道。“其实，我相信你完全了解我的。”他最后相当严厉地加了一句。","“Sir,” our hero articulated at last, trying to speak almost in a whisper, and not looking at his companion, “we are going different ways, I believe ... I am convinced of it, in fact,” he said, after a pause.“I am convinced, indeed, that you quite understand me,” he added, rather severely, in conclusion."
"“我本希望……”他的同伴最后说，“我本希望……无疑，你宽宏大量，会原谅我的……在这里，我不知道和谁说……我的情况……我相信你会原谅我的冒昧打扰的。其实，我想出于怜悯，你今天早上还对我表现出了一些关心。对我来说，我从一开始就对你产生兴趣了。我……”","“I could have wished...” his companion pronounced at last, “I could have wished... no doubt you will be magnanimous and pardon me... I don’t know to whom to address myself here... my circumstances... I trust you will pardon my intrusiveness.I fancied, indeed, that, moved by compassion, you showed some interest in me this morning.On my side, I felt drawn to you from the first moment.I...”"
"此时，戈利亚德金先生打心里希望他的同伴能钻到泥土里。","At this point Mr. Golyadkin inwardly wished that his companion might sink into the earth."
"“恕我冒昧，我希望你能给我一个宽容的解释机会，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇……”","“If I might venture to hope that you would accord me an indulgent hearing, Yakov Petrovitch...”"
"“我们——此时，我们——我们……你最好和我一起回家。”戈利亚德金先生回答道，“我们现在要穿到涅瓦大街的对面，在那里我们会更方便些，然后从那个小胡同通过……我们最好走小胡同。”","“We—here, we—we... you had better come home with me,” answered Mr. Golyadkin.“We will cross now to the other side of the Nevsky Prospect, it will be more convenient for us there, and then by the little back street... we’d better go by the back street.”"
"“很好，我们当然可以走小胡同。”我们主人公那个谦恭的同伴胆怯地回答道，他回答的口气里暗示着不是他去选择，而且以他的处境，他也很乐意接受走小胡同。至于戈利亚德金先生，他完全不明白自己身上发生了什么事。他无法相信自己。他无法从惊愕中恢复过来。","“Very well, by all means let us go by the back street,” our hero’s meek companion responded timidly, suggesting by the tone of his reply that it was not for him to choose, and that in his position he was quite prepared to accept the back street.As for Mr. Golyadkin, he was utterly unable to grasp what was happening to him.He could not believe in himself.He could not get over his amazement."
"第七章","CHAPTER 7"
"他进自己的寓所时，在楼梯上才稍微清醒了一些。","He recovered himself a little on the staircase as he went up to his flat."
"“噢，我真蠢啊。”他内心自责着，“我这是要把他带到哪里呀？我在把自己的脑袋往绳套里套啊。看到我们在一起，彼得鲁什卡会怎么想呀？现在，这个无赖胆敢怎么想啊？他疑心很重……”","“Oh, I’m a sheep’s head,” he railed at himself inwardly.“Where am I taking him?I am thrusting my head into the noose.What will Petrushka think, seeing us together?What will the scoundrel dare to imagine now?He’s suspicious...”"
"但是，后悔已经晚啦。戈利亚德金先生敲了敲门。门开了，彼得鲁什卡开始帮这位访客和自己的老爷脱大衣。戈利亚德金先生用怀疑的眼神看着，仅仅偷偷瞥了彼得鲁什卡一眼，极力想读懂他的面部表情，推测出他在想什么。但使他十分惊讶的是，他看到自己的仆人并没有流露出丝毫的惊奇，而正相反，他好像料到了这种事似的。当然，他看起来不像原来那样闷闷不乐了。他的眼睛望向一边，看上去似乎想要向什么人进攻似的。","But it was too late to regret it.Mr. Golyadkin knocked at the door; it was opened, and Petrushka began taking off the visitor’s coat as well as his master’s.Mr. Golyadkin looked askance, just stealing a glance at Petrushka, trying to read his countenance and divine what he was thinking.But to his intense astonishment he saw that his servant showed no trace of surprise, but seemed, on the contrary, to be expecting something of the sort.Of course he did not look morose, as it was; he kept his eyes turned away and looked as though he would like to fall upon somebody."
"“难道今天有人对他们施魔法了？”我们的主人公想道，“一定有什么恶魔笼络他们了。今天，在他们所有人中肯定有什么异常。该死的，太让人担忧了！”","“Hasn’t somebody bewitched them all today?” thought our hero.“Some devil must have got round them.There certainly must be something peculiar in the whole lot of them today.Damn it all, what a worry it is!”"
"戈利亚德金先生在把他的访客带到自己的房间，并客气地邀请他坐下时，就这样想着，思考着。那个访客看上去非常害羞，他很腼腆，谦逊地观察着主人的一举一动，注视着他的眼神，似乎想设法从中猜透他的心思。他所有的姿势都有一种被蹂躏、受欺压、畏惧的模样，因此——如果可以这样比喻的话——他此刻更像是一个失去了自己的衣服而穿着别人衣服的人：袖子到了胳膊肘那里，衣服的腰部几乎到了他的脖子，而他则在时刻不停地往下拽短马甲。他向一边扭来扭去的，还转过去，努力想把自己藏起来，或是偷偷地看看每一张脸，听听人们有没有在谈论他的处境、在笑他、或使他蒙羞——他羞愧得满脸通红，茫然不知所措，虚荣心受到了伤害……戈利亚德金先生把帽子放在窗台上，一不当心，使它飞落到了地上。这位访客立刻飞奔过去把它捡起来，掸掉上面的尘土，小心翼翼地将它放回原来的地方，却把他自己的放在了椅子旁边的地板上，他自己则温顺地坐在这把椅子的边上。这件小事多少使戈利亚德金先生睁开了眼睛。他意识到这个人正处在极大的困境中，因此没有像起初那样特意为他的访客费事，而是十分得体地把一切都留给了那个人自己。就访客来说，他也什么都没做。他是害羞，有点羞愧，还是出于礼貌在等他的主人先开口，就不确定了，也很难确定。此时，彼得鲁什卡进来了。他静静地站在门口，眼睛盯着离访客和主人坐的地方最远的那个方向。","Such were Mr. Golyadkin’s thoughts and reflections as he led his visitor into his room and politely asked him to sit down.The visitor appeared to be greatly embarrassed, he was very shy, and humbly watched every movement his host made, caught his glance, and seemed trying to divine his thoughts from them.There was a downtrodden, crushed, scared look about all his gestures, so that—if the comparison may be allowed—he was at that moment rather like the man who, having lost his clothes, is dressed up in somebody else’s: the sleeves work up to the elbows, the waist is almost up to his neck, and he keeps every minute pulling down the short waistcoat; he wriggles sideways and turns away, tries to hide himself, or peeps into every face, and listens whether people are talking of his position, laughing at him or putting him to shame—and he is crimson with shame and overwhelmed with confusion and wounded vanity...Mr. Golyadkin put down his hat in the window, and carelessly sent it flying to the floor.The visitor darted at once to pick it up, brushed off the dust, and carefully put it back, while he laid his own on the floor near a chair, on the edge of which he meekly seated himself.This little circumstance did something to open Mr. Golyadkin’s eyes; he realized that the man was in great straits, and so did not put himself out for his visitor as he had done at first, very properly leaving all that to the man himself.The visitor, for his part, did nothing either; whether he was shy, a little ashamed, or from politeness was waiting for his host to begin is not certain and would be difficult to determine.At that moment Petrushka came in; he stood still in the doorway, and fixed his eyes in the direction furthest from where the visitor and his master were seated."
"“我要端两份饭吗？”他用发哑的嗓子漫不经心地说。","“Shall I bring in dinner for two?” he said carelessly, in a husky voice."
"“我——我不知道……你……嗯，端两份，伙计。”","“I—I don’t know... you... yes, bring dinner for two, my boy.”"
"彼得鲁什卡出去了。戈利亚德金先生瞥了一眼他的访客。访客的脸红到了耳根。戈利亚德金先生是个好心人，因此，由于心地善良，他立刻想出了一个理论。","Petrushka went out.Mr. Golyadkin glanced at his visitor.The latter crimsoned to his ears.Mr. Golyadkin was a kind-hearted man, and so in the kindness of his heart he at once elaborated a theory."
"“这个人手头有点紧。”他想道，“确实，他才上了一天班。极有可能他当时受了苦。也许他像样的衣服就是他的一切，他连吃饭的钱都没有。啊，可怜的人，他似乎受尽了折磨！但是，没关系。就某点来看，这样也好……”“不好意思，”戈利亚德金先生开口了，“请问一下，我该怎么称呼你啊。”","“The fellow’s hard up,” he thought.“Yes, and in his situation only one day.Most likely he’s suffered in his time.Maybe his good clothes are all that he has, and nothing to get him a dinner.Ah, poor fellow, how crushed he seems!But no matter; in a way it’s better so...”“Excuse me,” began Mr. Golyadkin, “allow me to ask what I may call you.”"
"“我……我……我叫雅科夫·彼得罗维奇。”访客差不多用耳语说着，似乎良心不安，感到羞愧，似乎在为自己也叫雅科夫·彼得罗维奇而道歉。","“I... I... I’m Yakov Petrovitch,” his visitor almost whispered, as though conscience-stricken and ashamed, as though apologizing for being called Yakov Petrovitch too."
"“雅科夫·彼得罗维奇！”我们的访客重复道，无法掩盖他的困惑。","“Yakov Petrovitch!” repeated our visitor, unable to conceal his confusion."
"“是的，就是这样……和您同名。”温顺的访客回答道，冒险微笑着，有点开玩笑地说着。不过，他注意到主人根本无心开玩笑，便立即退缩了，摆出一副很严肃的神情，虽然有点尴尬。","“Yes, just so...The same name as yours,” responded the meek visitor, venturing to smile and speak a little jocosely.But at once he drew back, assuming a very serious air, though a little disconcerted, noticing that his host was in no joking mood."
"“您……请允许我问一下，是什么让我有如此荣幸……？”","“You... allow me to ask you, to what am I indebted for the honour...?”"
"“得知您宽宏大量又乐善好施，”这位访客从他的座位上半站起来，用快速但又胆怯的声音插话道，“我冒昧地恳求您，恳请您的……相识和关照……”他最后说道，难以措辞，竭力在选择一些既不过于阿谀奉承又不过于低三下四的词语，从而既不有失自己的尊严，又不至于冒昧，有无礼的平等之意。实际上，可以说，这位访客的言行举止就像一个彬彬有礼的乞丐，穿着带补丁的马甲，口袋里装着一张荣誉护照，他还没有通过实践学会去得体地伸手乞讨。","“Knowing your generosity and your benevolence,” interposed the visitor in a rapid but timid voice, half rising from his seat, “I have ventured to appeal to you and to beg for your... acquaintance and protection...” he concluded, choosing his phrases with difficulty and trying to select words not too flattering or servile, that he might not compromise his dignity and not so bold as to suggest an unseemly equality.In fact, one may say the visitor behaved like a gentlemanly beggar with a darned waistcoat, with an honourable passport in his pocket, who has not yet learnt by practice to hold out his hand properly for alms."
"“您把我弄迷惑了。”戈利亚德金先生回答说。他看着周围，看着墙壁和访客。“我怎么能……也就是说，我是说，我怎样才能给您帮助啊？”","“You perplex me,” answered Mr. Golyadkin, gazing round at himself, his walls and his visitor.“In what could I... that is, I mean, in what way could I be of service to you?”"
"“我一看见您就被吸引住了，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇，请宽大地原谅我，我建立了希望，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇。我……我现在正处于绝境，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇。我很穷，有很多麻烦，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇，而且才来这里不久。听说您天生善良，又有一副好心肠，而且和我同名……”","“I felt drawn to you, Yakov Petrovitch, at first sight, and, graciously forgive me, I built my hopes Yakov Petrovitch.I... I’m in a desperate plight here, Yakov Petrovitch; I’m poor, I’ve had a great deal of trouble, Yakov Petrovitch, and have only recently come here.Learning that you, with your innate goodness and excellence of heart, are of the same name...”"
"戈利亚德金先生皱了皱眉头。","Mr. Golyadkin frowned."
"“由于您和我同名，又是同乡，我才下定决心来求助于您，让您了解我的困境。”","“Of the same name as myself and a native of the same district, I made up my mind to appeal to you, and to make known to you my difficult position.”"
"“很好，很好，我真不知道该说什么。”戈利亚德金先生用尴尬的声音回答道，“我们吃完饭再说吧……”","“Very good, very good; I really don’t know what to say,” Mr. Golyadkin responded in an embarrassed voice.“We’ll have a talk after dinner...”"
"访客鞠了个躬。饭端来了。彼特鲁斯卡摆好桌子，戈利亚德金先生和他的访客继而开始用餐了。晚饭并没有持续很久，因为他们俩都很匆忙：主人是由于觉得局促不安，此外还为饭菜不好而感到惭愧——他之所以感到惭愧部分是因为他想请访客美餐一顿，而部分是因为他想表现出自己过得并不像乞丐。至于访客，他也非常困惑，觉得极其尴尬。他吃完拿起的那块面包后，就不敢伸手去拿另一块了。他羞于为自己取用最好的饭菜，还不停地使主人确信他根本不饿，饭菜好极了，他觉得极其满意，而且至死都不会忘记的。吃完饭后，戈利亚德金先生点着了烟斗，把拿来的另外一只给了他的访客。他们面对面坐下后，访客就开始讲述他的奇遇了。","The visitor bowed; dinner was brought in.Petrushka laid the table, and Mr. Golyadkin and his visitor proceeded to partake of it.The dinner did not last long, for they were both in a hurry, the host because he felt ill at ease, and was, besides, ashamed that the dinner was a poor one—he was partly ashamed because he wanted to give the visitor a good meal, and partly because he wanted to show him he did not live like a beggar.The visitor, on his side too, was in terrible confusion and extremely embarrassed.When he had finished the piece of bread he had taken, he was afraid to put out his hand to take another piece, was ashamed to help himself to the best morsels, and was continually assuring his host that he was not at all hungry, that the dinner was excellent, that he was absolutely satisfied with it, and should not forget it to his dying day.When the meal was over, Mr. Golyadkin lighted his pipe, and offered a second, which was brought in, to his visitor.They sat facing each other, and the visitor began telling his adventures."
"小戈利亚德金先生的故事持续了三四个小时。不过，他的历史是由最无关紧要的和最悲惨的事件组成的，如果可以那样说的话。他讲到了他在省里某个法庭任职之事，讲到了检察官和法庭庭长，讲到了一些部门的政治阴谋，讲到了某些登记员的堕落，讲到了一个巡视员，讲到了部门新上司的突然任命，讲到了第二个戈利亚德金先生是如何经受折磨的，而他并没有任何过错。他还讲到了他年迈的姑妈彼拉盖娅·谢苗诺芙娜；讲到了他由于自己敌人的各种阴谋是怎样丢掉工作，然后步行来到彼得堡的；讲到了他在彼得堡度过的穷困潦倒的时光，他如何长期努力找工作却徒劳无果，花光了所有的钱，用光了一切，几乎要流落街头，靠面包屑度日，和着泪水吞下去，睡在光秃秃的地板上，最终一个好心的基督徒怎样竭力帮助他，为他引见，并大度地替他安排了新差事。戈利亚德金先生的访客一边讲自己的故事，一边哭，用一块看起来像油布的蓝格子手帕擦着眼泪。他最后对戈利亚德金先生和盘托出，承认自己眼下不仅无法维持生活，没有钱租住一个像样的房间，而且甚至连件合适的穿戴都没有，他最后还说，因此，自己只能凑合着买双质量很差的皮靴，且不得不临时租一身制服。","Mr. Golyadkin junior’s story lasted for three or four hours.His history was, however, composed of the most trivial and wretched, if one may say so, incidents.It dealt with details of service in some lawcourt in the provinces, of prosecutors and presidents, of some department intrigues, of the depravity of some registration clerks, of an inspector, of the sudden appointment of a new chief in the department, of how the second Mr. Golyadkin had suffered quite without any fault on his part; of his aged aunt, Pelegea Semyonovna; of how, through various intrigues on the part of his enemies, he had lost his situation, and had come to Petersburg on foot; of the harassing and wretched time he had spent here in Petersburg, how for a long time he had tried in vain to get a job, had spent all his money, had nothing left, had been living almost in the street, lived on a crust of bread and washed it down with his tears, slept on the bare floor, and finally how some good Christian had exerted himself on his behalf, had given him an introduction, and had nobly got him into a new berth.Mr. Golyadkin’s visitor shed tears as he told his story, and wiped his eyes with a blue-check handkerchief that looked like oilcloth.He ended by making a clean breast of it to Mr. Golyadkin, and confessing that he was not only for the time without means of subsistence and money for a decent lodging, but had not even the wherewithal to fit himself out properly, so that he had, he said in conclusion, been able to get together enough for a pair of wretched boots, and that he had had to hire a uniform for the time."
"戈利亚德金先生心软了，他真的被感动了。尽管访客的故事是最微不足道的故事，但在他心头，字字句句还是如天堂的吗哪。实际情况就是，戈利亚德金先生开始忘掉了自己最后的疑虑，开始敞开心灵，向往自由和欢庆，最后还在脑子里戏称自己是个傻子。这一切是那么自然！多么让他伤心的一件事啊，多么令他苦恼的一件事啊！确实有，真的有一种棘手的情况——不过，毕竟，这也不是件不幸的事，这还不至于使一个人蒙羞，不至于诋毁他的名誉或毁掉他的前程，如果他是无辜的，因为自然本身也卷入其中。而且，这位访客请求关照，他在哭，抱怨命运，看上去是那样一个天真直率、可怜、微不足道的人，没有任何手腕，也没有任何恶意，而他现在似乎因与戈利亚德金先生长得异常相像而觉得难为情，尽管也可能是出于不同的原因。他的行为举止绝对没什么可指责的，他的一个愿望就是去取悦自己的主人，而他看起来就像一个人深受良心的谴责，觉得对不住别的什么人似的。比如，一谈到什么不确定之处，访客就马上同意戈利亚德金先生的看法。如果他无意中提出了与戈利亚德金先生相反的观点，而之后发现自己出了纰漏，就会立刻改正自己的错误，为自己的行为作解释，并明确表示自己和主人说的是同一个意思，他和主人的想法一样，对所有事情的看法也和他完全一致。实际上，访客在竭力“讨好”戈利亚德金先生，因此，戈利亚德金先生最终认定他的访客一定是个在各个方面都非常亲切友好的人。这时，茶端来了。已将近九点钟了。戈利亚德金先生感到心情非常愉快，变得充满活力、激动不安，也放松了一些，最后还投入到了同访客的兴致勃勃而又饶有趣味的交谈中。戈利亚德金先生在欢乐的时刻，喜欢讲些有趣的轶事。所以，此刻他就给访客讲了许多有关彼得堡的事情，有关它的娱乐活动和有吸引力的事，有关剧院、俱乐部，有关布留洛夫的画，以及关于两个英国人特地从英格兰到彼得堡看夏宫的铁栅栏，看完后立即就返回了；还有关于办公室的事，关于奥尔苏菲·伊万诺维奇和安德雷·菲利波维奇，关于俄罗斯不断发展，日新月异地向完美状态发展的道路，因此","Mr. Golyadkin was melted; he was genuinely touched.Even though his visitor’s story was the paltriest story, every word of it was like heavenly manna to his heart.The fact was that Mr. Golyadkin was beginning to forget his last misgivings, to surrender his soul to freedom and rejoicing, and at last mentally dubbed himself a fool.It was all so natural!And what a thing to break his heart over, what a thing to be so distressed about!To be sure there was, there really was, one ticklish circumstance—but, after all, it was not a misfortune; it could be no disgrace to a man, it could not cast a slur on his honour or ruin his career, if he were innocent, since nature herself was mixed up in it.Moreover, the visitor begged for protection, wept, railed at destiny, seemed such an artless, pitiful, insignificant person, with no craft or malice about him, and he seemed now to be ashamed himself, though perhaps on different grounds, of the strange resemblance of his countenance with that of Mr. Golyadkin’s.His behaviour was absolutely unimpeachable; his one desire was to please his host, and he looked as a man looks who feels conscience-stricken and to blame in regard to some one else.If any doubtful point were touched upon, for instance, the visitor at once agreed with Mr. Golyadkin’s opinion.If by mistake he advanced an opinion in opposition to Mr. Golyadkin’s and afterwards noticed that he had made a slip, he immediately corrected his mistake, explained himself and made it clear that he meant the same thing as his host, that he thought as he did and took the same view of everything as he did.In fact, the visitor made every possible effort to “make up to” Mr. Golyadkin, so that the latter made up his mind at last that his visitor must be a very amiable person in every way.Meanwhile, tea was brought in; it was nearly nine o’clock.Mr. Golyadkin felt in a very good-humour, grew lively and skittish, let himself go a little, and finally plunged into a most animated and interesting conversation with his visitor.In his festive moments Mr. Golyadkin was fond of telling interesting anecdotes.So now he told the visitor a great deal about Petersburg, about its entertainments and attractions, about the theatre, the clubs, about Brulov’s picture, and about the two Englishmen who came from England to Petersburg on purpose to look at the iron railing of the Summer Garden, and returned at once when they had seen it; about the office; about Olsufy Ivanovitch and Andrey Filippovitch; about the way that Russia was progressing, was hour by hour progressing towards a state of perfection, so that"
"“艺术与文学如今在这里繁荣昌盛”；","“Arts and letters flourish here today”;"
"还有有关他最近在《北方蜜蜂》上看到的一则关于印度一种力大无比的蟒蛇的趣闻，有关勃兰别乌斯男爵，等等。总之，戈利亚德金先生非常高兴，首先，因为他平静下来了；其次，因为，就这样，他几乎不再害怕敌人了，现在还准备好了向他们所有人都提出挑战，进行你死我活的战斗；再次，因为他现在作为赞助人，正在做善事。然而，他从心底还是意识到自己并不是十足的快乐，仍然有一条隐秘的寄生虫在啃噬着他的心，虽然只是极小的一条。一想到在奥尔苏菲·伊万诺维奇家的前一个晚上，他就非常担忧。如果那时发生的一切能不发生，他现在愿意付出高昂的代价。","about an anecdote he had lately read in the Northern Bee concerning a boa-constrictor in India of immense strength; about Baron Brambeus, and so on.In short, Mr. Golyadkin was quite happy, first, because his mind was at rest, secondly, because, so far from being afraid of his enemies, he was quite prepared now to challenge them all to mortal combat; thirdly, because he was now in the role of patron and was doing a good deed.Yet he was conscious at the bottom of his heart that he was not perfectly happy, that there was still a hidden worm gnawing at his heart, though it was only a tiny one. He was extremely worried by the thought of the previous evening at Olsufy Ivanovitch’s.He would have given a great deal now for nothing to have happened of what took place then."
"“不过，没关系的！”我们的主人公最后认定，他打心里拿定主意，往后要表现得举止得体，决不再这样胡闹了。因为戈利亚德金先生现在被完全激起了，突然变得几乎乐极了，所以想去快活一下。先是彼得鲁什卡拿来了朗姆酒，接着又准备了潘趣酒。访客和主人先各自干了一杯，然后又喝了一杯。访客看上去比先前更加亲切友好了，更加证实了他的坦诚直率及其迷人的性格。他深得戈利亚德金先生的欢心，似乎只因他的喜庆而高兴，把他视为自己唯一的恩人。他拿起一支笔和一张纸，要求戈利亚德金不要看他写什么，而之后才给主人看他写下的东西。原来是一首四行诗，感情丰富，语言和书写都很优美，而且很明显是这个亲切友好的访客自己的创作。这首诗是这样的：","“It’s no matter, though!” our hero decided at last, and he firmly resolved in his heart to behave well in future and never to be guilty of such pranks again.As Mr. Golyadkin was now completely worked up, and had suddenly become almost blissful, the fancy took him to have a jovial time.Rum was brought in by Petrushka, and punch was prepared.The visitor and his host drained a glass each, and then a second.The visitor appeared even more amiable than before, and gave more than one proof of his frankness and charming character; he entered keenly into Mr. Golyadkin’s joy, seemed only to rejoice in his rejoicing, and to look upon him as his one and only benefactor.Taking up a pen and a sheet of paper, he asked Golyadkin not to look at what he was going to write, but afterwards showed his host what he had written.It turned out to be a verse of four lines, written with a good deal of feeling, in excellent language and handwriting, and evidently was the composition of the amiable visitor himself.The lines were as follows—"
"“纵使你把我遗忘，","“If thou forget me,"
"我也不会忘记你的；","I shall not forget thee;"
"虽然世事无常，","Though all things may be,"
"不要忘记我。”","Do not thou forget me.“"
"戈利亚德金先生热泪盈眶，拥抱了自己的伙伴，他深受感动，开始向他的朋友讲一些自己的秘密和隐私，在谈话中还着重谈了安德雷·菲利波维奇和克拉克·奥尔苏菲耶芙娜。","With tears in his eyes Mr. Golyadkin embraced his companion, and, completely overcome by his feelings, he began to initiate his friend into some of his own secrets and private affairs, Andrey Filippovitch and Klara Olsufyevna being prominent in his remarks."
"“嗨，你可以确信，我们会一起挺过去的，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇。”我们的主人公对他的访客说，“你和我会对彼此产生好感的，就像鱼儿喜欢水那样，雅科夫·菲利波维奇，我们会像亲兄弟一样的。我们要奸诈点，亲爱的朋友，我们一起努力，我们也策划个阴谋去惩罚他们一下。为了惩罚他们，我们也要策划个阴谋。你不要相信他们任何人。我了解你，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇，我了解你的性格，你会毫不犹豫地把一切都告诉他们的，你知道，你是个老实人！你必须远离他们所有人，我的伙计。”","“Well, you may be sure we shall get on together, Yakov Petrovitch,” said our hero to his visitor.“You and I will take to each other like fish to the water, Yakov Petrovitch; we shall be like brothers; we’ll be cunning, my dear fellow, we’ll work together; we’ll get up an intrigue, too, to pay them out.To pay them out we’ll get up an intrigue too.And don’t you trust any of them.I know you, Yakov Petrovitch, and I understand your character; you’ll tell them everything straight out, you know, you’re a guileless soul!You must hold aloof from them all, my boy.”"
"他的伙伴完全同意了，向戈利亚德金先生道了谢，最后也含着眼泪。","His companion entirely agreed with him, thanked Mr. Golyadkin, and he, too, grew tearful at last."
"“你知道吗，雅沙，”戈利亚德金先生用颤抖的声音，有气无力地接着说道，“你暂时必须和我住在一起，或永远和我住在一起。我们会一起挺过去的。你说呢，兄弟，嗯？你不要因为我们目前这样奇怪的境遇就担心或埋怨，埋怨是罪过，兄弟，这是造化使然！大自然母亲对她的馈赠是慷慨大方的，就是那样的，雅沙兄弟！我说这些是出于对你的爱，出于兄弟之爱。不过，我们要奸诈点，雅沙，我们也放个地雷，我们让他们破嘴大笑。”","“Do you know, Yasha,” Mr. Golyadkin went on in a shaking voice, weak with emotion, “you must stay with me for a time, or stay with me for ever.We shall get on together.What do you say, brother, eh?And don’t you worry or repine because there’s such a strange circumstance about us now; it’s a sin to repine, brother; it’s nature!And Mother Nature is liberal with her gifts, so there, brother Yasha!It’s from love for you that I speak, from brotherly love.But we’ll be cunning, Yasha; we’ll lay a mine, too, and we’ll make them laugh out the other side of their mouths.”"
"他们最后都喝到了第三杯和四杯潘趣酒，这时戈利亚德金先生开始察觉到两种感觉：一种是他异乎寻常地高兴，而另一种是他双腿无法站立了。客人自然被邀请留下来过夜了。床是用两把椅子以某种方式临时搭成的。小戈利亚德金先生声称，在朋友家，光秃秃的地板也会是软绵绵的床，对他而言，他在随便哪里都可以睡的，谦逊而又深表感激。他现在就像在天堂，他当时经历了许多困难和悲伤，他看到了人生沉浮，有各种各样的事要去忍受，况且——谁知道将来会是什么样的呢？——也许他还有更多的要去忍受。大戈利亚德金先生对此提出了抗议，开始坚持说人们必须相信上帝。他的客人完全同意，还说，当然，没有人会像上帝那样的。这时，大戈利亚德金先生说道土耳其人甚至还在睡梦中恭请上帝，就某些方面来说，他们是对的。不过，戈利亚德金先生不同意某些博学的教授传扬的对土耳其先知穆罕默德的口头诽谤，承认他在他自己的行业里还是一位伟大的政治家。接着，他转到了对阿尔及尔理发店非常有趣的描写，这是他在一本杂集上看到的。这两个朋友尽情地笑土耳其人的单纯质朴，但也为他们的狂热而深表敬意，他们把这种狂热归因于鸦片……最后，客人开始脱衣服了。戈利亚德金先生由于心地善良，想到他很有可能连件像样的衬衫都没有，就到了屏风后面，以避免使一个本来就受尽苦难的人觉得难为情，部分也为了尽可能地让自己打消对彼得鲁什卡的疑虑，去试探他一下，如果可能的话，让他高兴起来，对这个家伙友好点，这样大家都会很高兴，周围的一切都会令人愉快的。必须说的是，彼得鲁什卡还是使戈利亚德金先生非常不安。","They reached their third and fourth glasses of punch at last, and then Mr. Golyadkin began to be aware of two sensations: the one that he was extraordinarily happy, and the other that he could not stand on his legs.The guest was, of course, invited to stay the night.A bed was somehow made up on two chairs.Mr. Golyadkin junior declared that under a friend’s roof the bare floor would be a soft bed, that for his part he could sleep anywhere, humbly and gratefully; that he was in paradise now, that he had been through a great deal of trouble and grief in his time; he had seen ups and downs, had all sorts of things to put up with, and—who could tell what the future would be?—maybe he would have still more to put up with.Mr. Golyadkin senior protested against this, and began to maintain that one must put one’s faith in God.His guest entirely agreed, observing that there was, of course, no one like God.At this point Mr. Golyadkin senior observed that in certain respects the Turks were right in calling upon God even in their sleep.Then, though disagreeing with certain learned professors in the slanders thy had promulgated against the Turkish prophet Mahomet and recognizing him as a great politician in his own line, Mr. Golyadkin passed to a very interesting description of an Algerian barber’s shop which he had read in a book of miscellanies.The friends laughed heartily at the simplicity of the Turks, but paid due tribute to their fanaticism, which they ascribed to opium...At last the guest began undressing, and thinking in the kindness of his heart that very likely he hadn’t even a decent shirt, Mr. Golyadkin went behind the screen to avoid embarrassing a man who had suffered enough, and partly to reassure himself as far as possible about Petrushka, to sound him, to cheer him up if he could, to be kind to the fellow so that every one might be happy and that everything might be pleasant all round.It must be remarked that Petrushka still rather bothered Mr. Golyadkin."
"“你现在去睡觉吧，彼得。”戈利亚德金先生进入自己仆人的房间，乏味地说，“你现在去睡吧，八点钟叫醒我。明白了吗，彼得鲁什卡？”","“You go to bed now, Pyotr,” Mr. Golyadkin said blandly, going into his servant’s domain; “you go to bed now and wake me up at eight o’clock.Do you understand Petrushka?”"
"戈利亚德金先生说得异常温和，异常友善。可是，彼得鲁什卡仍然保持缄默。他正忙着铺自己的床，甚至没有转过身去正视自己的老爷，而出于纯粹的尊敬，他也应该那样做的。","Mr. Golyadkin spoke with exceptional softness and friendliness.But Petrushka remained mute.He was busy making his bed, and did not even turn round to face his master, which he ought to have done out of simple respect."
"“听到我说的了吗，彼得？”戈利亚德金先生接着说道，“你现在去睡觉，明天早上八点叫我，明白了吗？”","“Did you hear what I said, Pyotr?”Mr. Golyadkin went on.“You go to bed now and wake me tomorrow at eight o’clock; do you understand?”"
"“哎呀，我知道的，告诉我有什么用啊？”彼得鲁什卡自己嘟囔着。","“Why, I know that; what’s the use of telling me?”Petrushka grumbled to himself."
"“嗯，这就对啦，彼得鲁什卡。我说这话只不过是要使你高兴和安心。现在我们都很幸福，所以我也想让你感到幸福和满足。现在祝你晚安。睡吧，彼得鲁什卡，睡吧。我们都得努力……别想那些不对劲的事了，伙计……”戈利亚德金先生开始说道，不过半中间停了下来。“是不是说得太多了？”他想道，“我是不是扯得太远了？总是这样，我常常做过头。”","“Well, that’s right, Petrushka; I only mention it that you might be happy and at rest.Now we are all happy, so I want you, too, to be happy and satisfied.And now I wish you good-night.Sleep, Petrushka, sleep; we all have to work... Don’t think anything amiss, my man...” Mr. Golyadkin began, but stopped short.“Isn’t this too much?” he thought.“Haven’t I gone too far?That’s how it always is; I always overdo things.”"
"我们的主人公离开彼得鲁什卡时，对自己感到非常不满意。此外，他被彼得鲁什卡的粗暴和无礼深深地伤害。“和这无赖说笑，老爷给了他很大的面子，而这无赖竟不识抬举。”戈利亚德金先生想道，“但就那样，这就是那帮人的下流作风！”","Our hero felt much dissatisfied with himself as he left Petrushka.He was, besides, rather wounded by Petrushka’s grumpiness and rudeness.“One jests with the rascal, his master does him too much honour, and the rascal does not feel it,” thought Mr. Golyadkin.“But there, that’s the nasty way of all that sort of people!”"
"他多少有点摇摇晃晃地回到了自己的房间，看到客人已经睡下，就在自己的床边坐了一会儿。","Somewhat shaken, he went back to his room, and, seeing that his guest had settled himself for the night, he sat down on the edge of his bed for a minute."
"“得啦，你必须承认，雅沙，”他摇晃着脑袋，用耳语开始说道，“你个无赖，你知道吗，你竟那样对我！你看，你和我同名，你知道吗？”他继续说着，以一种相当亲昵的方式和他的访客开着玩笑。最后，戈利亚德金先生友好地向他道了晚安后，开始准备睡觉了。此时，访客打起了呼噜。戈利亚德金先生自己也钻进被窝，笑着，自言自语地低声说道：“你今天喝醉了，我亲爱的朋友，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇，你个无赖，你个穷光蛋——怎么就姓这个呢！哎呀，你对什么如此高兴啊？明天你就会哭的，你要知道，你个哭闹者，我拿你怎么办好呢？”","“Come, you must own, Yasha,” he began in a whisper, wagging his head, “you’re a rascal, you know; what a way you’ve treated me!You see, you’ve got my name, do you know that?” he went on, jesting in a rather familiar way with his visitor.At last, saying a friendly good-night to him, Mr. Golyadkin began preparing for the night.The visitor meanwhile began snoring.Mr. Golyadkin in his turn got into bed, laughing and whispering to himself: “You are drunk today, my dear fellow, Yakov Petrovitch, you rascal, you old Golyadkin—what a surname to have!Why, what are you so pleased about?You’ll be crying tomorrow, you know, you sniveller; what am I to do with you?”"
"此刻，一种相当奇怪的感觉遍及戈利亚德金先生的全身，有点像怀疑或是懊悔。","At this point a rather strange sensation pervaded Mr. Golyadkin’s whole being, something like doubt or remorse."
"“我兴奋过度了，太放纵自己了。”他想道，“此刻，我的脑袋里有一个吵闹声，并且我醉了。我无法控制自己了，我是个笨蛋！我含糊不清地说了许多废话，而且，就像个无赖，我还想耍花招呢。当然，原谅和忘却伤害是最大的美德。不过，这终归不好！对，就是这样的！”","“I’ve been over-excited and let myself go,” he thought; “now I’ve a noise in my head and I’m drunk; I couldn’t restrain myself, ass that I am!And I’ve been babbling bushels of nonsense, and, like a rascal, I was planning to be so sly.Of course, to forgive and forget injuries is the height of virtue; but it’s a bad thing, nevertheless!Yes, that is so!”"
"这时，戈利亚德金先生站起来，拿起蜡烛，蹑手蹑脚地又去看了一下入睡的客人。他盯了他很久，陷入了沉思中。","At this point Mr. Golyadkin got up, took a candle and went on tiptoe to look once more at his sleeping guest.He stood over him for a long time meditating deeply."
"“一幅让人不快的画面！一个滑稽的闹剧，一个纯粹的滑稽剧，而那就是事情的实际情况！”","“An unpleasant picture!A burlesque, a regular burlesque, and that’s the fact of the matter!”"
"戈利亚德金先生最后终于躺下了。他的脑袋在嗡嗡嗡作响。他渐渐地开始昏昏欲睡了……竭力想思考一些很重要的事情，某一个微妙的问题——但却无法做到。睡神突然降临到了他那忠实的脑袋上，他睡着了，就像通常人们在某个喜庆的聚会上因不胜酒力却喝了五杯潘趣酒那样睡着了。","At last Mr. Golyadkin settled down finally.There was a humming, a buzzing, a ringing in his head.He grew more and more drowsy... tried to think about something very important, some delicate question—but could not.Sleep descended upon his devoted head, and he slept as people generally do sleep who are not used to drinking and have consumed five glasses of punch at some festive gathering."
"第八章","CHAPTER 8"
"第二天早上，戈利亚德金先生像往常那样在八点钟醒来了。他一醒来就想起了前一天晚上的所有奇遇。他一边回忆，一边皱着眉头。“哎呀，我昨晚真做了一回傻瓜！”他想道，坐了起来，瞥了一眼访客的床。但是，令他吃惊的是，他看到房间里没有任何痕迹，不仅没有访客的踪迹，甚至连访客睡的床也不见了！","Mr. Golyadkin woke up next morning at eight o’clock as usual; as soon as he was awake he recalled all the adventures of the previous evening—and frowned as he recalled them.“Ugh, I did play the fool last night!” he thought, sitting up and glancing at his visitor’s bed.But what was his amazement when he saw in the room no trace, not only of his visitor, but even of the bed on which his visitor had slept!"
"“这是怎么回事呀？”戈利亚德金先生差点尖叫了起来。“这到底是怎么回事呀？这种新情况预示着什么呀？”","“What does it mean?”Mr. Golyadkin almost shrieked.“What can it be?What does this new circumstance portend?”"
"戈利亚德金先生目瞪口呆，迷惑地盯着那空着的地方。这时，门吱嘎一声响，彼得鲁什卡端着茶盘进来了。","While Mr. Golyadkin was gazing in open-mouthed bewilderment at the empty spot, the door creaked and Petrushka came in with the tea-tray."
"“去哪啦，去哪啦？”我们的主人公指着昨晚访客睡觉的地方，用勉强可以听得见的声音说道。","“Where, where?” our hero said in a voice hardly audible, pointing to the place which had been occupied by his visitor the night before."
"起初，彼得鲁什卡没做任何回答，也没有看自己的老爷，而是盯着右边的一个角落，直到戈利亚德金先生觉得也必须朝那个角落看去。不过，短暂的沉默之后，彼得鲁什卡用粗鲁而又沙哑的声音回答说老爷不在家。","At first Petrushka made no answer and did not look at his master, but fixed his eyes upon the corner to the right till Mr. Golyadkin felt compelled to look into that corner too.After a brief silence, however, Petrushka in a rude and husky voice answered that his master was not at home."
"“你个笨蛋，我不就是你的老爷啊，彼得鲁什卡！”戈利亚德金先生用短促的声音说道，睁大眼睛看着他的仆人。","“You idiot; why I’m your master, Petrushka!” said Mr. Golyadkin in a breaking voice, looking open-eyed at his servant."
"彼得鲁什卡没有做任何回复，而是这样看了一眼戈利亚德金先生，使得戈利亚德金先生满脸通红，一直红到了耳根——那眼神带着一种侮辱的责备，简直就像公开的辱骂，看着他。就像常言所说的，戈利亚德金先生彻底惊呆了。最后，彼得鲁什卡解释说‘另一个’在一个半小时前已经走了，而且不愿等了。当然，他的回答听起来是真实的，而且也很有可能。显然，彼得鲁什卡没有在撒谎。他那侮辱的眼神和所用的‘另一个’一词都只是那令人不快的情况的结果，他已经对这种情况很熟悉了，而且他还明白——尽管很模糊——一定是出了什么问题，命运安排了另一个惊喜，一个不完全令人愉快的惊喜，在等待着他。","Petrushka made no reply, but he gave Mr. Golyadkin such a look that the latter crimsoned to his ears—looked at him with an insulting reproachfulness almost equivalent to open abuse.Mr. Golyadkin was utterly flabbergasted, as the saying is.At last Petrushka explained that the ‘other one’ had gone away an hour and a half ago, and would not wait.His answer, of course, sounded truthful and probable; it was evident that Petrushka was not lying; that his insulting look and the phrase the ‘other one’ employed by him were only the result of the disgusting circumstance with which he was already familiar, but still he understood, though dimly, that something was wrong, and that destiny had some other surprise, not altogether a pleasant one, in store for him."
"“好吧，我们走着瞧。”他暗自想着。“等着吧，在适当的时候我们会弄清所有这一切的……噢，主啊，可怜可怜我们吧！”他最后哀叹道，声音与往常竟大不相同。“我为何要请他来啊，我到底为什么要那样做呀？哎呀，是我自己把脑袋钻进他们那鬼鬼祟祟的绳套里了，是我自己亲手系了绳套。唉，你个傻瓜，你个笨蛋！你就不能忍住胡言乱语呀，像个傻孩子、法庭职员、根本没任何地位的可怜人、破布头、破烂的洗碗布。你就是个爱说三道四的人，一个老女人！……哦，圣徒们啊！那个无赖，他写了诗，表达了对我的爱慕之情！怎么办……那个无赖，如果他再出现的话，我怎样才能客气地要他离开呢？当然，有各种各样的方式和手段。我可以说事情其实是这样的，我的薪水非常有限……或以某种方式把他吓跑，说考虑到各种因素，我不得不说清楚……说他必须付一半的伙食费和房租，而且要预付。唔！不，该死的，不！那会降低我的身份的。这不是很得体！难道我不能这样做吗？我让彼得鲁什卡用某种方式惹他生气，对他不敬、粗鲁无礼，然后就以那样的方式摆脱他。让他们以某种方式彼此相互攻击……不，该死的，不！这太危险了，再说，如果从那个角度看的话——这根本就不对！这根本就不对！但是，得啦，即使他不来，事情也不会好到哪里去的！我昨晚对他胡说一通！……唉，事情不好了，糟啦！唉，情况不妙！唉，我真是个可恶的笨蛋，一个可恨的傻瓜蛋！你就不能训练自己表现出应有的举止吗？你就不能表现得明智些吗？得啦，假如他来了并回绝了，那该怎么办？上帝保佑，他会来的！如果他真的来了，我会很高兴的……”","“All right, we shall see,” he thought to himself.“We shall see in due time; we’ll get to the bottom of all this ... Oh, Lord, have mercy upon us!” he moaned in conclusion, in quite a different voice.“And why did I invite him, to what end did I do all that?Why, I am thrusting my head into their thievish noose myself; I am tying the noose with my own hands.Ach, you fool, you fool!You can’t resist babbling like some silly boy, some chancery clerk, some wretched creature of no class at all, some rag, some rotten dishcloth; you’re a gossip, an old woman!... Oh, all ye saints!And he wrote verses, the rogue, and expressed his love for me!How could ... How can I show him the door in a polite way if he turns up again, the rogue?Of course, there are all sorts of ways and means.I can say this is how it is, my salary being so limited ... Or scare him off in some way saying that, taking this and that into consideration, I am forced to make clear ... that he would have to pay an equal share of the cost of board and lodging, and pay the money in advance.H’m! No, damn it all, no!That would be degrading to me.It’s not quite delicate!Couldn’t I do something like this: suggest to Petrushka that he should annoy him in some way, should be disrespectful, be rude, and get rid of him in that way.Set them at each other in some way...No, damn it all, no!It’s dangerous and again, if one looks at it from that point of view—it’s not the right thing at all!Not the right thing at all!But there, even if he doesn’t come, it will be a bad look-out, too!I babbled to him last night!... Ach, it’s a bad look-out, a bad look-out!Ach, we’re in a bad way!Oh, I’m a cursed fool, a cursed fool!you can’t train yourself to behave as you ought, you can’t conduct yourself reasonably.Well, what if he comes and refuses.And God grant he may come!I should be very glad if he did come...”"
"戈利亚德金先生喝着茶，不断看墙上的钟，就这样沉思着。","Such were Mr. Golyadkin’s reflections as he swallowed his tea and glanced continually at the clock on the wall."
"“差一刻就九点钟了，该走了。会发生什么事的！那里会出什么事呢？我想知道这里面究竟隐藏着什么——也就是说，有什么意图、目的，以及各种各样的阴谋。如果能弄清所有这些人在策划着什么，他们的第一步是什么，就太好了……”","“It’s a quarter to nine; it’s time to go.And something will happen!What will there be there?I should like to know what exactly lies hidden in this—that is, the object, the aim, and the various intrigues.It would be a good thing to find out what all these people are plotting, and what will be their first step...”"
"戈利亚德金先生再也无法忍受了。他扔下还没抽完的烟斗，穿好衣服，动身去办公室，如果可能的话，他急切地想避开危险，希望亲自去看看，打消自己的一切疑虑。那里有危险，他自己也知道那里有危险。","Mr. Golyadkin could endure it no longer.He threw down his unfinished pipe, dressed and set off for the office, anxious to ward off the danger if possible and to reassure himself about everything by his presence in person.There was danger: he knew himself that there was danger."
"“我们……会挖出祸根的。”戈利亚德金先生说着，把他的大衣和橡胶套鞋脱在了门厅，“我们会立即着手处理这些事情的。”","“We ... will get to the bottom of it,” said Mr. Golyadkin, taking off his coat and goloshes in the entry.“We’ll go into all these matters immediately.”"
"我们的主人公决定这样行动后，把自己收拾好，摆出一副得体而正式的神态，正要进入紧挨着的房间，这时，突然就在门口，他撞上了前一天刚认识的那个人，他的朋友兼伙伴。小戈利亚德金先生似乎没有注意到大戈利亚德金先生，虽然他们几乎鼻子对鼻子地碰上了。小戈利亚德金先生似乎很忙，急匆匆地要去什么地方，而且气喘吁吁的。他摆出如此一副正式，如此一副公务在身的神态，看起来好像任何人都能从他的脸上猜到：‘被委以特别的任务’……","Making up his mind to act in this way, our hero put himself to rights, assumed a correct and official air, and was just about to pass into the adjoining room, when suddenly, in the very doorway, he jostled against his acquaintance of the day before, his friend and companion.Mr. Golyadkin junior seemed not to notice Mr. Golyadkin senior, though they met almost nose to nose.Mr. Golyadkin junior seemed to be busy, to be hastening somewhere, was breathless; he had such an official, such a business-like air that it seemed as though any one could read his face: ‘Entrusted with a special commission.’ ..."
"“哦，是你呀，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇！”我们的主人公紧紧地抓住昨晚访客的手，说道。","“Oh, it’s you, Yakov Petrovitch!” said our hero, clutching the hand of his last night’s visitor."
"“一会儿，一会儿，对不起，以后再说。”小戈利亚德金先生叫道，冲了出去。","“Presently, presently, excuse me, tell me about it afterwards,” cried Mr. Golyadkin junior, dashing on."
"“可是，对不起。我相信，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇，你想要……”","“But, excuse me; I believe, Yakov Petrovitch, you wanted ...”"
"“什么事啊？赶快说。”","“What is it?Make haste and explain.”"
"这时，前一天晚上的访客停下来了，似乎很勉强又不乐意，他的耳朵几乎贴到了戈利亚德金先生的鼻子上。","At this point his visitor of the previous night halted as though reluctantly and against his will, and put his ear almost to Mr. Golyadkin’s nose."
"“我必须告诉你，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇，你的举动太让我吃惊了……那种举动我似乎根本就没有料到。”","“I must tell you, Yakov Petrovitch, that I am surprised at your behaviour ... behaviour which seemingly I could not have expected at all.”"
"“任何事都有一定的规矩。去找阁下大人的秘书，然后按规矩再恳请办公室主任。你拿到你的请愿书了吗？”","“There’s a proper form for everything.Go to his Excellency’s secretary and then appeal in the proper way to the directors of the office.Have you got your petition?”"
"“你……我真的不知道，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇！你只是太让我吃惊了，雅科夫．彼得罗维奇！你肯定不认识我了，要不然就是带着天生的快乐，在开玩笑了。”","“You ... I really don’t know, Yakov Petrovitch!You simply amaze me, Yakov Petrovitch!You certainly don’t recognize me or, with characteristic gaiety, you are joking.”"
"“哦，是你啊。”小戈利亚德金先生说道，似乎刚刚才认出大戈利亚德金先生，“这么说，是你呀？怎么样，昨晚睡得好吗？”","“Oh, it’s you,” said Mr. Golyadkin junior, seeming only now to recognize Mr. Golyadkin senior.“So, it’s you?Well, have you had a good night?”"
"接着，小戈利亚德金先生微微一笑——笑得很正经，绝不是一种很合适的笑（因为，毕竟，他欠大戈利亚德金先生一份感激之情）——他这样很正经地笑着，还加了一句，说很高兴戈利亚德金先生睡得很好。之后，他微微鞠了一躬，稍微挪了挪脚，东张西望地看了看，就把眼睛垂向地面，走向侧门，急促地低声嘟囔着他还有特别的任务，就奔向了隔壁的房间。他像幽灵一样消失了。","Then smiling a little—a formal and conventional smile, by no means the sort of smile that was befitting (for, after all, he owed a debt of gratitude to Mr. Golyadkin senior)—smiling this formal and conventional smile, Mr. Golyadkin junior added that he was very glad Mr. Golyadkin senior had had a good night; then he made a slight bow and shuffling a little with his feet, looked to the right, and to the left, then dropped his eyes to the floor, made for the side door and muttering in a hurried whisper that he had a special commission, dashed into the next room.He vanished like an apparition."
"“啊，这太奇怪了！”我们的主人公嘟囔着，愣了一会儿，“这太奇怪了！这种情况太奇怪了。”","“Well, this is queer!” muttered our hero, petrified for a moment; “this is queer!This is a strange circumstance.”"
"此刻，戈利亚德金先生觉得好像浑身扎满了针头和别针。","At this point Mr. Golyadkin felt as though he had pins and needles all over him."
"“不过，”他走向自己所在的部门，继续自言自语着，“不过，我很久前就谈到过这种情况了，我早就有种预感，他有特别的任务。哎呀，我昨天就说过这个人肯定是因某一特别的任务而被雇用的。”","“However,” he went on to himself, as he made his way to his department, “however, I spoke long ago of such a circumstance: I had a presentiment long ago that he had a special commission.Why, I said yesterday that the man must certainly be employed on some special commission.”"
"“昨天的那份文件抄录好了吗，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇？”安东·安东诺维奇向戈利亚德金先生问道，当时戈利亚德金先生就坐在他身旁。“您把它带来了吗？”","“Have you finished copying out the document you had yesterday, Yakov Petrovitch,” Anton Antonovitch Syetotchkin asked Mr. Golyadkin, when the latter was seated beside him.“Have you got it here?”"
"“是的。”戈利亚德金先生喃喃地说道，以一种相当无助的眼神看着这位首席办事员。","“Yes,” murmured Mr. Golyadkin, looking at the head clerk with a rather helpless glance."
"“那就好！我提到它是因为安德雷·菲利波维奇要过两次了。我想肯定是阁下大人要用……”","“That’s right!I mention it because Andrey Filippovitch has asked for it twice.I’ll be bound his Excellency wants it...”"
"“是的，已经完成了……”","“Yes, it’s finished...”"
"“嗯，那就好。”","“Well, that’s all right then.”"
"“我想，安东·安东诺维奇，我一直都在严格履行自己的职责。对上司交代的工作，我向来都是一丝不苟的，而且我都在认真负责地处理它。”","“I believe, Anton Antonovitch, I have always performed my duties properly.I’m always scrupulous over the work entrusted to me by my superiors, and I attend to it conscientiously.”"
"“是的。嗯，您这是什么意思啊？”","“Yes.Why, what do you mean by that?”"
"“没什么，安东·安东诺维奇。我只是想说，安东·安东诺维奇，我……也就是说，我想表达的是怨恨和恶意在寻找它们日常令人恶心的食物时，有时是不会放过任何人的……”","“I mean nothing, Anton Antonovitch.I only want to explain, Anton Antonovitch, that I ... that is, I meant to express that spite and malice sometimes spare no person whatever in their search for their daily and revolting food...”"
"“不好意思，我不太明白您的意思。您在暗指什么人吗？”","“Excuse me, I don’t quite understand you.What person are you alluding to?”"
"“我只是想说，安东·安东诺维奇，我在找寻的是一条笔直的路，我鄙视拐弯抹角的办事方式。我不是个玩阴谋诡计的人，如果可以这样说的话，我完全有理由为此而骄傲……”","“I only meant to say, Anton Antonovitch, that I’m seeking the straight path and I scorn going to work in a roundabout way.That I am not one to intrigue, and that, if I may be allowed to say so, I may very justly be proud of it...”"
"“是的。的确如此，在我看来，我完全赞同你的说法。但允许我说一下，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇，上流社会是不大容许个性的存在的，比如说，我准备好了忍受背后的一切中伤——因为每个人在背地里都会遭到辱骂的——但是，当着我的面，如果您愿意，先生，我不能容忍任何人的无礼。我在政府工作，头发都变白了，先生，我不允许任何人在我年老时对我放肆无礼……”","“Yes.That’s quite so, and to the best of my comprehension I thoroughly endorse your remarks; but allow me to tell you, Yakov Petrovitch, that personalities are not quite permissible in good society, that I, for instance, am ready to put up with anything behind my back—for every one’s abused behind his back—but to my face, if you please, my good sir, I don’t allow any one to be impudent.I’ve grown grey in the government service, sir, and I don’t allow any one to be impudent to me in my old age...”"
"“不，安东·安东诺维奇……要知道，安东·安东诺维奇……你没有完全明白我的意思。当然，安东·安东诺维奇，就我而言，我只能认为这是一种荣幸……”","“No, Anton Antonovitch ... you see, Anton Antonovitch ... you haven’t quite caught my meaning.To be sure, Anton Antonovitch, I for my part could only think it an honour ...”"
"“哦，那么，我也请您原谅。我们受的是旧时的教育。让我们去学你们那新奇怪异的方式太晚了。我相信到目前为止，我们理解的东西已足以为祖国服务了。您也知道，先生，我因二十五年来无可指责的工作而得到了一枚功勋章……”","“Well, then, I ask pardon too.We’ve been brought up in the old school.And it’s too late for us to learn your new-fangled ways.I believe we’ve had understanding enough for the service of our country up to now.As you are aware, sir, I have an order of merit for twenty-five years’ irreproachable service...”"
"“这我感受到了，安东·安东诺维奇，对我来说，我也完全体会到了这一切。但我不是那个意思，我是在说假面具，安东·安东诺维奇……”","“I feel it, Anton Antonovitch, on my side, too, I quite feel all that.But I didn’t mean that, I am speaking of a mask, Anton Antonovitch...”"
"“假面具？”","“A mask?”"
"“您又……我就担心您又从错误的意义上理解这个，我的话就是那个意思，就像您自己说的那样，安东·安东诺维奇。我只是在阐明一个理论，换句话说，我在提出一种观点，安东·安东诺维奇，带假面具的人已变得远非罕见了，如今很难辨别出一个在假面具下的人……”","“Again you ... I am apprehensive that you are taking this, too, in a wrong sense, that is the sense of my remarks, as you say yourself, Anton Antonovitch.I am simply enunciating a theory, that is, I am advancing the idea, Anton Antonovitch, that persons who wear a mask have become far from uncommon, and that nowadays it is hard to recognize the man beneath the mask ...”"
"“唉，您知道吗，也不完全那么难。有时还是相当容易的。有时，人们并没必要绕远去寻找它。”","“Well, do you know, it’s not altogether so hard.Sometimes it’s fairly easy.Sometimes one need not go far to look for it.”"
"“不，您也清楚，安东·安东诺维奇，我是说，我说我自己，比如说我，只有在必要时才会戴面具。从字面意思上说，就是仅仅在狂欢时或某些节日聚会上；但从另一个不很明显的意义上说，在日常生活中，我在人前是不戴面具的。这就是我要说的，安东·安东诺维奇。”","“No, you know, Anton Antonovitch, I say, I say of myself, that I, for instance, do not put on a mask except when there is need of it; that is simply at carnival time or at some festive gathering, speaking in the literal sense; but that I do not wear a mask before people in daily life, speaking in another less obvious sense.That’s what I meant to say, Anton Antonovitch.”"
"“哦，嗨，不过，我们得略过所有这些了，因为我现在没时间了。”安东·安东诺维奇说着，从自己的座位上站起来，整理了一些文件，以便向阁下大人汇报。“我想，您的事情很快会在一定的时候得到说明的。您自己会明白应该去谴责谁，应该去责备谁，因此，我恳请您不要再跟我说更多的妨碍我工作的解释和理由了……”","“Oh, well, but we must drop all this, for now I’ve no time to spare,” said Anton Antonovitch, getting up from his seat and collecting some papers in order to report upon them to his Excellency.“Your business, as I imagine, will be explained in due course without delay.You will see for yourself whom you should censure and whom you should blame, and thereupon I humbly beg you to spare me from further explanations and arguments which interfere with my work...”"
"“不，安东·安东诺维奇，”戈利亚德金先生脸色变得有点苍白，对着正要离去的安东·安东诺维奇的身影说，“我没那个意思。”","“No, Anton Antonovitch,” Mr. Golyadkin, turning a little pale, began to the retreating figure of Anton Antonovitch; “I had no intention of the kind.”"
"“这是怎么回事呀？”我们的主人公在只剩下他一个人时，继续自言自语着，“现在刮的是什么风啊，而这个新转机又是什么意思啊？”","“What does it mean?” our hero went on to himself, when he was left alone; “what quarter is the wind in now, and what is one to make of this new turn?”"
"就在我们那茫然失措又几近崩溃的主人公决定要去解决这个新问题时，从隔壁房间里传出了活动和嘈闹的声音。门打开了，刚在阁下大人书房里办事的安德雷·菲利波维奇气喘吁吁地出现在了门口，喊了一声戈利亚德金先生。戈利亚德金先生知道是什么事，也不希望让安德雷·菲利波维奇久等，就从座位上跳了起来，他立即忙碌了起来，把需要的稿件整理准备妥当，预备带着稿件随安德雷·菲利波维奇到阁下大人的书房去。突然，小戈利亚德金先生差点就从正站在门口的安德雷·菲利波维奇的胳膊下滑过去，冲进了屋里，匆匆忙忙，上气不接下气，带着一副严肃而坚决的神态。他直接朝大戈利亚德金先生跑去，而大戈利亚德金先生盼望的正是这样的探访。","At the very time when our bewildered and half-crushed hero was setting himself to solve this new question, there was a sound of movement and bustle in the next room, the door opened and Andrey Filippovitch, who had been on some business in his Excellency’s study, appeared breathless in the doorway, and called to Mr. Golyadkin.Knowing what was wanted and anxious not to keep Andrey Filippovitch waiting, Mr. Golyadkin leapt up from his seat, and as was fitting immediately bustled for all he was worth getting the manuscript that was required finally neat and ready and preparing to follow the manuscript and Andrey Filippovitch into his Excellency’s study.Suddenly, almost slipping under the arm of Andrey Filippovitch, who was standing right in the doorway, Mr. Golyadkin junior darted into the room in breathless haste and bustle, with a solemn and resolutely official air; he bounded straight up to Mr. Golyadkin senior, who was expecting nothing less than such a visitation."
"“文件，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇，阁下大人想要文件。您准备好了吗？”大戈利亚德金先生的朋友急促地轻轻小声说道，“安德雷·菲利波维奇在等你……”","“The papers, Yakov Petrovitch, the papers ... his Excellency has been pleased to ask for them; have you got them ready?”Mr. Golyadkin senior’s friend whispered in a hurried undertone.“Andrey Filippovitch is waiting for you...”"
"“不用您告诉我，我也知道他在等我。”大戈利亚德金先生也急促地低声说道。","“I know he is waiting without your telling me,” said Mr. Golyadkin senior, also in a hurried whisper."
"“不，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇，我不是那个意思。我根本不是那个意思，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇，根本不是那么回事。我同情您，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇，我是受同情心的驱使。”","“No, Yakov Petrovitch, I did not mean that; I did not mean that at all, Yakov Petrovitch, not that at all; I sympathise with you, Yakov Petrovitch, and am humbly moved by genuine interest.”"
"“我还是恳请您饶了我吧。对不起，对不起……”","“Which I most humbly beg you to spare me.Allow me, allow me ...”"
"“当然，要把它装在信封里，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇，在第三页上做个记号。对不起，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇……”","“You’ll put it in an envelope, of course, Yakov Petrovitch, and you’ll put a mark in the third page; allow me, Yakov Petrovitch...”"
"“对不起，如果你乐意的话……”","“You allow me, if you please ...”"
"“可是，我是说，这里有墨渍，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇。您知道这里有墨渍吗？”","“But, I say, there’s a blot here, Yakov Petrovitch; did you know there was a blot here? ...”"
"这时，安德雷·菲利波维奇第二次喊了雅科夫·彼得罗维奇。","At this point Andrey Filippovitch called Yakov Petrovitch a second time."
"“马上，安德雷·菲利波维奇，我只是……您懂俄语吗，先生？”","“One moment, Andrey Filippovitch, I’m only just ... Do you understand Russian, sir?”"
"“最好用小刀把它拿掉，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇。最好让我来。您自己最好别动它，雅科夫·菲利波维奇，让我来——我用小刀把它处理掉……”","“It would be best to take it out with a penknife, Yakov Petrovitch.You had better rely upon me; you had better not touch it yourself, Yakov Petrovitch, rely upon me—I’ll do it with a penknife ...”"
"安德雷·菲利波维奇第三次喊了戈利亚德金先生。","Andrey Filippovitch called Mr. Golyadkin a third time."
"“可是，不好意思，墨渍在哪里呀？我看这里根本就没有墨渍嘛。”","“But, allow me, where’s the blot?I don’t think there’s a blot at all.”"
"“是个很大的墨渍。就在这里！这里，不好意思啊，我看到在这里了……请让我来，雅科夫·菲利波维奇，我只用小刀碰它，我会出于真心的同情，用小刀刮掉它。您瞧，像这样，看到了吧，好了。”","“It’s a huge blot.Here it is!Here, allow me, I saw it here ... you just let me, Yakov Petrovitch, I’ll just touch it with the penknife, I’ll scratch it out with the penknife from true-hearted sympathy.There, like this; see, it’s done.”"
"这时，小戈利亚德金先生在他们之间发生的短暂争斗中十分出乎意料地制服了大戈利亚德金先生，因此，与大戈利亚德金先生的心愿完全相反，他突然莫名奇妙地夺走了上司要的文件，他没有像自己背信弃义地对大戈利亚德金先生保证的那样，出于真心的同情用小刀刮掉墨渍，而是急匆匆地把它卷起来，夹在胳膊下面，两步就蹦到了根本没有注意到他的花招的安德雷·菲利波维奇身边，飞似的和安德雷·菲利波维奇进了主任的房间。戈利亚德金先生好像惊呆了，手里仍然拿着小刀，明显要用它刮掉什么东西……我们的主人公还没法搞清楚自己的新处境。他无法马上恢复过来。他感受到了打击，但不知怎么，却认为没什么。在可怕的、难以言状的痛苦中，他终于离开了自己的座位，急匆匆地径直去了主任的房间，一路上在向上苍哀求一切都会没事的……在靠近主任私人房间的最后的那个屋子里，他直接碰上了安德雷·菲利波维奇以及和自己同名的那个人。他们俩都往旁边移了移。安德雷·菲利波维奇带着愉快的微笑在说话，大戈利亚德金先生的同名人也微笑着，在讨好安德雷·菲利波维奇，围着他，并与他保持着一定的距离，以示尊敬，还带着愉快的神情在他耳边低声说着什么。安德雷·菲利波维奇和蔼地点点头，对此表示同意。瞬间，我们的主人公明白了整个处境。原来是那份工作超出了阁下大人的预期（这是他后来才知道的）而且还在需要的时间之前按时完成了。阁下大人对此极为满意。听说阁下大人甚至还对小戈利亚德金先生说了“谢谢”，热情地向他道了谢，说自己偶尔会回想起来的，并且永远不会忘记的……当然，戈利亚德金先生做的第一件事就是进行抗议，用他所有的精力进行抗议。他面如死灰，几乎不知道自己在干什么，就朝安德雷·菲利波维奇冲去。但是，安德雷·菲利波维奇听到是戈利亚德金先生的私事，便拒绝听下去，坚定地说没时间听他说个人的事。","At this point, and quite unexpectedly, Mr. Golyadkin junior overpowered Mr. Golyadkin senior in the momentary struggle that had arisen between them, and so, entirely against the latter’s will, suddenly, without rhyme or reason, took possession of the document required by the authorities, and instead of scratching it out with the penknife in true-hearted sympathy as he had perfidiously promised Mr. Golyadkin senior, hurriedly rolled it up, put it under his arm, in two bounds was beside Andrey Filippovitch, who noticed none of his manoeuvres, and flew with the latter into the Director’s room.Mr. Golyadkin remained as though rivetted to the spot, holding the penknife in his hand and apparently on the point of scratching something out with it ...　　Our hero could not yet grasp his new position.He could not at once recover himself.He felt the blow, but thought that it was somehow all right.In terrible, indescribable misery he tore himself at last from his seat, rushed straight to the Director’s room, imploring heaven on the way that it would be all right ... In the furthest most room, which adjoined the Director’s private room, he ran straight upon Andrey Filippovitch in company with his namesake.Both of them moved aside.Andrey Filippovitch was talking with a good-humoured smile, Mr. Golyadkin senior’s namesake was smiling, too, fawning upon Andrey Filippovitch and tripping about at a respectful distance from him, and was whispering something in his ear with a delighted air, to which Andrey Filippovitch assented with a gracious nod.In a flash our hero grasped the whole position.The fact was that the work had surpassed his Excellency’s expectations (as he learnt afterwards) and was finished punctually by the time it was needed.His Excellency was extremely pleased with it.It was even said that his excellency had said “Thank you” to Mr. Golyadkin junior, had thanked him warmly, had said that he would remember it on occasion and would never forget it...Of course, the first thing Mr. Golyadkin did was to protest, to protest with the utmost vigour of which he was capable.Pale as death, and hardly knowing what he was doing, he rushed up to Andrey Filippovitch.But the latter, hearing that Mr. Golyadkin’s business was a private matter, refused to listen, observing firmly that he had not a minute to spare for his own affairs."
"他语调的粗暴和拒绝使戈利亚德金先生大吃一惊。","The curtness of his tone and his refusal struck Mr. Golyadkin."
"“也许，我最好还是在别处试试吧……我最好还是恳求安东·安东诺维奇吧。”","“I had better, perhaps, try in another quarter ... I had better appeal to Anton Antonovitch.”"
"可令他失望的是，安东·安东诺维奇也不在，他也不知在什么地方忙什么事呢！","But to his disappointment Anton Antonovitch was not available either: he, too, was busy over something somewhere!"
"“啊，难怪他请我饶过他，不愿去听解释和讨论呢！”我们的主人公想。“这就是那个老无赖大脑里想的呀！真是那样的话，我只好大胆地去找阁下大人了。”","“Ah, it was not without design that he asked me to spare him explanation and discussion!” thought our hero.“This was what the old rogue had in his mind!In that case I shall simply make bold to approach his Excellency.”"
"戈利亚德金先生仍然脸色苍白，觉得大脑里完全乱哄哄的，对自己该决定做什么感到极为困惑，便坐在了椅子边上。“如果所有这一切都只是些无关紧要的事，就太好了。”他不停地暗自寻思着，“的确，如此神秘的事情是完全不大可能的。首先，那毫无意义；其次，那也不可能发生。最有可能的是，那是想象，要不然就是发生过的别的事，而不是真的发生了，亦或许我自己……不知怎么把自己误当成别的什么人了……总之，那是绝对不可能的事。”","Still pale and feeling that his brain was in a complete ferment, greatly perplexed as to what he ought to decide to do, Mr. Golyadkin sat down on the edge of the chair.“It would have been a great deal better if it had all been just nothing,” he kept incessantly thinking to himself.“Indeed, such a mysterious business was utterly improbable.In the first place, it was nonsense, and secondly it could not happen.Most likely it was imagination, or something else happened, and not what really did happen; or perhaps I went myself ... and somehow mistook myself for some one else ... in short, it’s an utterly impossible thing.”"
"就在戈利亚德金先生认定那绝对不可能时，小戈利亚德金先生飞一般地进了屋，双手拿着公文，胳膊下还夹着些。小戈利亚德金先生在路过时和安德雷·菲利波维奇说了两三句工作上的事，和这个交谈几句，和那个寒暄几句，又和另一个亲近一下，显然没有时间去浪费，他似乎要离开房间了，不过，对大戈利亚德金先生来说，幸运的是，他在门口不远处停了下来，与在那里干活的两三个职员擦肩而过时，说了几句话。大戈利亚德金先生迅速地径直向他走去。小戈利亚德金先生一看到大戈利亚德金先生向他走来，马上极其不安地开始向四周张望，想要逃脱。但我们的主人公已经拽住了他昨晚的那位客人的袖子。围在这两位九品文官周围的职员们向后退了一步，好奇地等着看会发生什么事。那个年长的九品文官意识到了公众舆论并不在他这边，意识到了他们正在秘密策划加害他：这更需要他此刻保持自己的立场。这是一个关键的时刻。","Mr. Golyadkin had no sooner made up his mind that it was an utterly impossible thing that Mr. Golyadkin junior flew into the room with papers in both hands as well as under his arm.Saying two or three words about business to Andrey Filippovitch as he passed, exchanging remarks with one, polite greetings with another, and familiarities with a third, Mr. Golyadkin junior, having apparently no time to waste, seemed on the point of leaving the room, but luckily for Mr. Golyadkin senior he stopped near the door to say a few words as he passed two or three clerks who were at work there.Mr. Golyadkin senior rushed straight at him.As soon as Mr. Golyadkin junior saw Mr. Golyadkin senior’s movement he began immediately, with great uneasiness, looking about him to make his escape.But our hero already held his last night’s guest by the sleeve.The clerks surrounding the two titular councillors stepped back and waited with curiosity to see what would happen.The senior titular councillor realized that public opinion was not on his side, he realized that they were intriguing against him: which made it all the more necessary to hold his own now.The moment was a decisive one."
"“好啦！”小戈利亚德金先生说道，相当不耐烦地看着大戈利亚德金先生。","“Well!” said Mr. Golyadkin junior, looking rather impatiently at Mr. Golyadkin senior."
"大戈利亚德金先生几乎无法呼吸了。","The latter could hardly breathe."
"“我不知道，”他开始说了，“用什么方法来向你明确说明你的举动的奇怪，先生。”","“I don’t know,” he began, “in what way to make plain to you the strangeness of your behaviour, sir.”"
"“嗯。继续说呀。”此时，小戈利亚德金先生转过身，冲站在周围的职员们眨了眨眼，似乎要让他们知道一出喜剧就要开始了。","“Well.Go on.”At this point Mr. Golyadkin junior turned round and winked to the clerks standing round, as though to give them to understand that a comedy was beginning."
"“先生，在目前的情况下，你对我的粗鲁无礼和厚颜无耻暴露了你真正的品质……比我的任何话语都更有力。别再指望耍花招了，那没用的……”","“The impudence and shamelessness of your manners with me, sir, in the present case, unmasks your true character ... better than any words of mine could do.Don’t rely on your trickery: it is worthless...”"
"“得啦，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇，现在告诉我，你晚上过的怎么样？”小戈利亚德金先生回答道，直直地看着大戈利亚德金先生。","“Come, Yakov Petrovitch, tell me now, how did you spend the night?” answered Mr. Golyadkin junior, looking Mr. Golyadkin senior straight in the eye."
"“你真是不成体统，先生。”这个九品文官说道，完全目瞪口呆了，几乎无法感觉到他脚下的地板，“我相信你会用另一种不同的语气的……”","“You forget yourself, sir,” said the titular councillor, completely flabbergasted, hardly able to feel the floor under his feet.“I trust that you will take a different tone...”"
"“我亲爱的！”小戈利亚德金先生惊叫道，对大戈利亚德金先生做了一个相当无礼的鬼脸，而且，突然出乎意料地装出一副爱抚他的模样，用两个手指掐了掐他那胖乎乎的脸。","“My darling!” exclaimed Mr. Golyadkin junior, making a rather unseemly grimace at Mr. Golyadkin senior, and suddenly, quite unexpectedly, under the pretence of caressing him, he pinched his chubby cheek with two fingers."
"我们的主人公满脸发热，像着了火似的……小戈利亚德金先生一看到自己的对手四肢发抖，愤怒得说不出话，脸红得像只龙虾，怒不可遏，真的可能被迫对他进行攻击，就立即以最无耻的方式赶紧提前与他的受害者站在一起。小戈利亚德金先生两三次拍了拍他的脸颊，胳肢了他两三下，就这样和他玩了几秒钟，而他的受害者则站着，浑身发僵，勃然大怒，简直乐坏了站在周围的年轻人。他最后带着最令人恶心的无耻，戳了一下大戈利亚德金先生那有几分凸起的肚子，带着最恶毒而挑逗的微笑对他说：“你太顽皮了，雅科夫兄弟，你太淘气了！我们要诡诈些，你和我，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇，我们要诡诈些。”","Our hero grew as hot as fire ... As soon as Mr. Golyadkin junior noticed that his opponent, quivering in every limb, speechless with rage, as red as a lobster, and exasperated beyond all endurance, might actually be driven to attack him, he promptly and in the most shameless way hastened to be beforehand with his victim.Patting him two or three times on the cheek, tickling him two or three times, playing with him for a few seconds in this way while his victim stood rigid and beside himself with fury to the no little diversion of the young men standing round, Mr. Golyadkin junior ended with a most revolting shamelessness by giving Mr. Golyadkin senior a poke in his rather prominent stomach, and with a most venomous and suggestive smile said to him: “You’re mischievous, brother Yakov, you are mischievous!We’ll be sly, you and I, Yakov Petrovitch, we’ll be sly.”"
"之后，在我们的主人公还没能够从最后一次袭击中渐渐清醒过来时，小戈利亚德金先生（事先对站在周围的围观者微微一笑）突然摆出一副完全公务在身、繁忙又正式的神态，把眼睛垂向地面，使自己卷入其中，同时畏缩了，快速地说了句“有特别的任务”，便短腿一跃，飞奔而去，进了隔壁的房间。我们的主人公无法相信自己的眼睛，仍然没法使自己冷静下来……","Then, and before our hero could gradually come to himself after the last attack, Mr. Golyadkin junior (with a little smile beforehand to the spectators standing round) suddenly assumed a most businesslike, busy and official air, dropped his eyes to the floor and, drawing himself in, shrinking together, and pronouncing rapidly “on a special commission” he cut a caper with his short leg, and darted away into the next room.Our hero could not believe his eyes and was still unable to pull himself together..."
"最后，他自己醒过来了。瞬间，大戈利亚德金先生认识到自己被毁灭了，在某种意义上被消灭了，他已经使自己蒙羞并败坏了自己的名声，他已成了笑柄，在围观者面前遭到了蔑视，他已经被人背信弃义地侮辱了，而他前一天还把这个人当作是自己最好的、最值得信赖的朋友，他已经陷入了彻底的混乱，便急忙去追自己的敌人。此刻，他甚至不会去想他的耻辱的目击者。","At last he roused himself.Recognizing in a flash that he was ruined, in a sense annihilated, that he had disgraced himself and sullied his reputation, that he had been turned into ridicule and treated with contempt in the presence of spectators, that he had been treacherously insulted, by one whom he had looked on only the day before as his greatest and most trustworthy friend, that he had been put to utter confusion, Mr. Golyadkin senior rushed in pursuit of his enemy.At the moment he would not even think of the witnesses of his ignominy."
"“他们都共同密谋策划好了。“他自言自语道，“他们互相帮助，互相差遣，对我进行攻击。”然而，我们的主人公追了十几步后，清楚地意识到一切追赶都是徒劳的、无济于事的，因此他返回了。“你跑不掉的。”他想，“总有一天你会被捕的。狼也得为羊的泪水付出代价的。”","“They’re all in a conspiracy together,” he said to himself; “they stand by each other and set each other on to attack me.”After taking a dozen steps, however, our hero perceived clearly that all pursuit would be vain and useless, and so he turned back.“You won’t get away,” he thought, “you will get caught one day; the wolf will have to pay for the sheep’s tears.”"
"戈利亚德金先生带着极端的镇静和最果断的决心，走向自己的椅子，并坐了下来。“你逃不掉的。”他又说道。","With ferocious composure and the most resolute determination Mr. Golyadkin went up to his chair and sat down upon it.“You won’t escape,” he said again."
"现在已经不是被动反抗的问题了：空气中弥漫着决心和好斗，任何人看到戈利亚德金先生那一刻是怎样满脸通红，几乎无法抑制自己的兴奋，把钢笔戳到墨水台里，又是带着怎样的暴怒，开始在公文上胡写乱画，都会事先肯定事情不会就这样过去的，不会以简简单单、娘娘腔的方式结束的。他在内心深处已经下定决心，并在心底深处发誓要付诸行动。说句实话，他还不是十分清楚该如何行动，或者说压根就不知道。不过，没关系，那没什么的！","Now it was not a question of passive resistance: there was determination and pugnacity in the air, and any one who had seen how Mr. Golyadkin at that moment, flushed and scarcely able to restrain his excitement, stabbed his pen into the inkstand and with what fury he began scribbling on the paper, could be certain beforehand that the matter would not pass off like this, and could not end in a simple, womanish way.In the depth of his soul he formed a resolution, and in the depth of his heart swore to carry it out.To tell the truth he still did not quite know how to act, or rather did not know at all, but never mind, that did not matter!"
"“如今，冒名行骗和恬不知耻是划不来的，先生。冒名行骗和恬不知耻，先生，是不会有好结果的，只会带来绞索。只有格利什卡·奥特列皮耶夫一个，先生，他通过冒名行骗，欺骗盲目的人们而得到了好处，但即便那样也没持续多久。”","“Imposture and shamelessness do not pay nowadays, sir.Imposture and shamelessness, sir, lead to no good, but lead to the halter.Grishka Otrepyov was the only one, sir, who gained by imposture, deceiving the blind people and even that not for long.”"
"尽管发生了这最后一种情况，戈利亚德金先生还是打算等等，直到某些人的面具掉下来，某些事情应该显现的那一刻。为此，首先，办公时间必须尽快结束，而在那之前，我们的主人公不打算采取任何行动。那时，他就知道自己下一步该如何行动，如何安排自己的整个行动计划，以降低那傲慢的触角，制服那条在啃尘土、卑鄙而无能的蛇。戈利亚德金先生无法允许别人把自己当作是用来擦脏皮靴的破布头。他不能同意他们这样做，尤其是在目前这种情况下。要不是最后那次侮辱，或许我们的主人公会压抑住自己的愤怒；或许他会保持沉默，会屈服，也不会固执地反抗；他可能只是稍稍争论一下，稍微抱怨一下，证明自己是正确的，之后会做出一点让步，接着或许会再做点让步，然后就完全改变观点，而且，特别是如果对方严肃地承认他是正确的，或许他会完全不介意，甚至会有点感动，甚至可能——谁知道呢——会产生一种新的、亲密的、热烈的友谊，比昨晚的友谊还要深厚，因此，这种友谊最终可能会使因两个人很不成体统的相似而带来的不快黯然失色，这样，这两个九品文官可能会非常高兴，可能会继续生活在一起，到一百岁，等等。","In spite of this last circumstance Mr. Golyadkin proposed to wait till such time as the mask should fall from certain persons and something should be made manifest.For this it was necessary, in the first place, that office hours should be over as soon as possible, and till then our hero proposed to take no step.He knew then how he must act after taking that step, how to arrange his whole plan of action, to abase the horn of arrogance and crush the snake gnawing the dust in contemptible impotence.To allow himself to be treated like a rag used for wiping dirty boots, Mr. Golyadkin could not.He could not consent to that, especially in the present case.Had it not been for that last insult, our hero might have, perhaps, brought himself to control his anger; he might, perhaps, have been silent, have submitted and not have protested too obstinately; he would just have disputed a little, have made a slight complaint, have proved that he was in the right, then he would have given way a little, then, perhaps, he would have given way a little more, then he would have come round altogether, then, especially when the opposing party solemnly admitted that he was right, perhaps, he would have overlooked it completely, would even have been a little touched, there might even, perhaps—who could tell—spring up a new, close, warm friendship, on an even broader basis than the friendship of last night, so that this friendship might, in the end, completely eclipse the unpleasantness of the rather unseemly resemblance of the two individuals, so that both the titular councillors might be highly delighted, and might go on living till they were a hundred, and so on.To tell the whole truth, Mr. Golyadkin began to regret a little that he had stood up for himself and his rights, and had at once come in for unpleasantness in consequence."
"“如果他让步，”戈利亚德金先生想，“说自己是在开玩笑，我会原谅他的。如果他大声承认的话，我更加会原谅他的。不过，我不会让别人把我当作是一块破布头的。即使是那些和他截然不同的人们，我也不允许他们那样对我的，更不用说我会允许一个堕落的人企图这样做。我不是一块破布头。我不是一块破布头，先生！”","“Should he give in,” thought Mr. Golyadkin, “say he was joking, I would forgive him.I would forgive him even more if he would acknowledge it aloud.But I won’t let myself be treated like a rag.And I have not allowed even persons very different from him to treat me so, still less will I permit a depraved person to attempt it.I am not a rag.I am not a rag, sir!”"
"总之，我们的主人公认定“你自己有过错，先生！”他想。他决心要竭力抗议到底。他就是这样一种人！他不准许自己被侮辱，更不用说允许别人把自己当成是一块破布头，尤其是不允许一个完全恶毒的人那样对他。不过，没有争辩，没有争吵！可能，如果有人想，比如说，如果有人确实坚持要把戈利亚德金先生变成一块破布头的话，他可能那样做，他可能那样做，而且不会反对，也不会受到惩罚（戈利亚德金先生自己有时也意识到了这一点），这样，他就会成为一块破布头而不是穷光蛋——是的，一块恶心的、脏兮兮的破布头，但那块破布头绝不是一块普通的破布头，它是一块有尊严的破布头，一块有知觉和感情的破布头，尽管尊严无法得到捍卫，情感无法收到维护，并且躲在破布头那坑脏的褶皱深处，但这些感情仍然在那里……","In short, our hero made up his mind “You’re in fault yourself, sir!” he thought.He made up his mind to protest with all his might to the very last.That was the sort of man he was!He could not consent to allow himself to be insulted, still less to allow himself to be treated as a rag, and, above all, to allow a thoroughly vicious man to treat him so.No quarrelling, however, no quarrelling!Possibly if some one wanted, if some one, for instance, actually insisted on turning Mr. Golyadkin into rag, he might have done so, might have done so without opposition or punishment (Mr. Golyadkin was himself conscious of this at times), and he would have been a rag and not Golyadkin—yes, a nasty, filthy rag; but that rag would not have been a simple rag, it would have been a rag possessed of dignity, it would have been a rag possessed of feelings and sentiments, even though dignity was defenceless and feelings could not assert themselves, and lay hidden deep down in the filthy folds of the rag, still these feelings were there ..."
"时间过得极其缓慢。终于，四点钟敲响了。没过多久，所有人都站起来，紧跟在部门主任后，各自回家去了。戈利亚德金先生混在了人群中，他机警地注意着，并没有跟丢他要找的那个人。最后，我们的主人公看到他的朋友向给职员们递大衣的办公室服务人员跑去，在他们附近闲荡着，以他通常的令人讨厌的方式等着他的大衣。这是关键的一刻。戈利亚德金先生设法挤出了人群，生怕落在后面，也忙着取大衣。但是，大衣却先给了戈利亚德金先生的朋友兼伙伴，因为此刻，这个人又像他惯常的那样，对他们巴结讨好，窃窃私语，卑躬屈膝，还在他们周围四处走动。","The hours dragged on incredibly slowly; at last it struck four.Soon after, all got up and, following the head of the department, moved each on his homeward way.Mr. Golyadkin mingled with the crowd; he kept a vigilant look out, and did not lose sight of the man he wanted.At last our hero saw that his friend ran up to the office attendants who handed the clerks their overcoats, and hung about near them waiting for his in his usual nasty way.The minute was a decisive one.Mr. Golyadkin forced his way somehow through the crowd and, anxious not to be left behind, he, too, began fussing about his overcoat.But Mr. Golyadkin’s friend and companion was given his overcoat first because on this occasion, too, he had succeeded, as he always did, in making up to them, whispering something to them, cringing upon them and getting round them."
"小戈利亚德金先生穿上大衣后，嘲讽地瞥了大戈利亚德金先生一眼，就这样公然地、挑衅地看着他，带着他特有的蛮横四处望了望，最后还在其他职员中间走来走去 ——无疑是为了给他们留下一个好印象——和这个说句话，和那个窃窃私语，恭敬地和第三个攀谈着，朝第四个笑笑，跟第五个握握手，之后就欢快地跑下了楼。大戈利亚德金先生快速地跟在他后面，在最后一个台阶上赶上了他。他抓住他的大衣领子，有种难以言表的高兴。看上去，小戈利亚德金先生好像觉得有点惊慌失措，他无助地望了望四周。","After putting on his overcoat, Mr. Golyadkin junior glanced ironically at Mr. Golyadkin senior, acting in this way openly and defiantly, looked about him with his characteristic insolence, finally he tripped to and fro among the other clerks—no doubt in order to leave a good impression on them—said a word to one, whispered something to another, respectfully accosted a third, directed a smile at a fourth, gave his hand to a fifth, and gaily darted downstairs.Mr. Golyadkin senior flew after him, and to his inexpressible delight overtook him on the last step, and seized him by the collar of his overcoat.It seemed as though Mr. Golyadkin junior was a little disconcerted, and he looked about him with a helpless air."
"“您这是什么意思？”他最后用微弱的声音低声对戈利亚德金先生说道。","“What do you mean by this?” he whispered to Mr. Golyadkin at last, in a weak voice."
"“先生，如果您还是个君子，我相信您一定记得昨天我们的友好关系。”我们的主人公说。","“Sir, if you are a gentleman, I trust that you remember our friendly relations yesterday,” said our hero."
"“啊，是啊！那又怎样？你睡得好吗？”","“Ah, yes!Well?Did you sleep well?”"
"顿时，大戈利亚德金先生气得说不出话来了。","Fury rendered Mr. Golyadkin senior speechless for a moment."
"“我睡得很好，先生……但我要说的是，先生，您在玩一个很复杂的把戏……”","“I slept well, sir ... but allow me to tell you, sir, that you are playing a very complicated game ...”"
"“这是谁说的？我的敌人们那样说的。”那个自称是戈利亚德金先生的人突然回答道，说完，他竟出乎意料地摆脱了真正的戈利亚德金先生那虚弱的手。他一脱身就急忙下了楼梯，向四周看了看，看见一辆出租马车，就跑过去，钻了进去，瞬间从大戈利亚德金先生的视线里消失了。那个被所有人遗弃、感到绝望的九品文官四下张望着，但是没有别的出租马车了。他试图奔跑，但两腿瘫软。他面带一副目瞪口呆的惊愕的神情，感觉自己垮掉了、枯萎了，他绝望地靠着灯柱，就那样在人行道中间呆了几分钟。对戈利亚德金先生来说，似乎一切都完了。","“Who says so?My enemies say that,” answered abruptly the man who called himself Mr. Golyadkin, and saying this, he unexpectedly freed himself from the feeble hand of the real Mr. Golyadkin.As soon as he was free he rushed away from the stairs, looked around him, saw a cab, ran up to it, got in, and in one moment vanished from Mr. Golyadkin senior’s sight.The despairing titular councillor, abandoned by all, gazed about him, but there was no other cab.He tried to run, but his legs gave way under him.With a look of open-mouthed astonishment on his countenance, feeling crushed and shrivelled up, he leaned helplessly against a lamp post, and remained so for some minutes in the middle of the pavement.It seemed as though all were over for Mr. Golyadkin."
"第九章","CHAPTER 9"
"显然，一切，甚至包括自然本身都和戈利亚德金先生作对。但是，他屹立在那里，没有被征服。他感觉自己没有被征服。他准备好了要斗争一番。他从之前的惊恐中恢复过来后，激情澎湃地用力摩拳擦掌。单从戈利亚德金先生的神情就能看得出来，他绝不会屈服。但是，危险显然在逼近。戈利亚德金先生也感觉到了危险。但怎么来对抗它，怎么来对付这危险呢？这是问题所在。一瞬间，戈利亚德金先生的脑子里甚至闪现过这样的念头：“为什么不就这样算了呢？为何不干脆就此放弃？嗯，那有什么？嗯，也没什么嘛。我会撇清关系，就当这个人不是我。”戈利亚德金先生这么想着。“我对这一切来个视而不见，置之不理。这个人不是我，这不就得了。他也是单独行事，也许也会放弃。他会没事闲溜达，这个流氓，他会没事溜达。他会杀回来，但还是会放弃。事情就会是这个样子！我也来个逆来顺受吧。而事实上，危险又在哪里呢？啊，危险在哪里呢？我倒是希望有人告诉我这事到底有什么危险。这只是小事一桩。这只是一件日常琐事而已……”","Everything, apparently, and even nature itself, seemed up in arms against Mr. Golyadkin; but he was still on his legs and unconquered; he felt that he was unconquered.He was ready to struggle.he rubbed his hands with such feeling and such energy when he recovered from his first amazement that it could be deduced from his very air that he would not give in.yet the danger was imminent; it was evident; Mr. Golyadkin felt it; but how to grapple with it, with this danger?— that was the question.— that was the question.the thought even flashed through Mr. Golyadkin’s mind for a moment, “After all, why not leave it so, simply give up?Why, what is it?Why, it’s nothing.I’ll keep apart as though it were not I,” thought Mr. Golyadkin.“I’ll let it all pass; it’s not I, and that’s all about it; he’s separate too, maybe he’ll give it up too; he’ll hang about, the rascal, he’ll hang about.He’ll come back and give it up again.Than’s how it will be!I’ll take it meekly.And, indeed, where is the danger?Come, what danger is there?I should like any one to tell me where the danger lies in this business.It is a trivial affair.An everyday affair...”"
"想到这儿，戈利亚德金先生欲言又止了，他把到嘴边的话又咽下了。他甚至骂自己怎么会有这样的想法。他当即认定自己有这种想法实在太卑鄙、太懦弱了。然而，事情却没有一丝一毫的进展。他觉得此刻绝对有必要下定决心采取某项行动。他甚至觉得，要是有人告诉他该做什么，他一定重重赏赐那人。是的，但是他怎么猜到该做什么呢？但是，事实上，他已经没有时间猜测了。无论如何，他已经没有时间浪费了。他雇了一辆马车，飞速地赶往家里。","At this point Mr. Golyadkin’s tongue failed; the words died away on his lips; he even swore at himself for this thought; he convicted himself on the spot of abjectness, of cowardice for having this thought; things were no forwarder, however.He felt that to make up his mind to some course of action was absolutely necessary for him at the moment; he even felt that he would have given a great deal to any one who could have told him what he must decide to do.Yes, but how could he guess what?Though, indeed, he had no time to guess.In any case, that he might lose no time he took a cab and dashed home."
"“那么，你现在感觉如何呢？”他自问道，“你想到什么会感到无比愉快呢，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇？你在做些什么？你这个流氓，你这个骗子，你在做些什么？是你把自己陷入这种困境，现在你知道哭了，知道抱怨了！”","“Well?“Well? What are you feeling now?” he wondered; “what are you graciously pleased to be thinking of, Yakov Petrovitch?What are you doing?What are you doing now, you rogue, you rascal?You’ve brought yourself to this plight, and now you are weeping and whimpering!”"
"戈利亚德金先生就这样一边坐在马车上颠簸着，一边挖苦讽刺着自己。此刻，揶揄自己以激起伤口的疼痛，极大地满足了戈利亚德金先生，几乎是一种令人沉醉其中的乐趣。","So Mr. Golyadkin taunted himself as he jolted along in the vehicle.To taunt himself and so to irritate his wounds was, at this time, a great satisfaction to Mr. Golyadkin, almost a voluptuous enjoyment."
"“嗯，”他想，“如果此刻出现个什么魔法师，或者下来个什么官方文件，告诉我：‘戈利亚德金，你必须剁下你右手的一个手指，这样你的事情就算了结了。再不会有另外一个戈利亚德金了，你将会很幸福，只是你会少一根手指。’是的，我愿意剁下我的一根手指，我会毫不犹豫，眼睛都不眨一下……让这一切都去见鬼吧。”这个走投无路的小文官最后大叫起来：“唉，这一切都是为了什么？”唉，这一切又只能是这样。是的，一切绝对只能如此。是的，就是只能如此，别无选择。起初，一切都很好。每个人都很开心，很幸福。但是，看看，偏偏得这样！不过，空谈是不起任何作用的，你必须有所行动。”","“Well,” he thought, “if some magician were to turn up now, or if it could come to pass in some official way and I were told: ‘Give a finger of your right hand, Golyadkin — and it’s a bargain with you; there shall not be the other Golyadkin, and you will be happy, only you won’t have your finger’ — yes, I would sacrifice my finger, I would certainly sacrifice it, I would sacrifice it without winking...The devil take it all!” the despairing titular councillor cried at last.“Why, what is it all for?“Why, what is it all for?Well, it all had to be; yes, it absolutely had to; yes, just this had to be, as though nothing else were possible!And it was all right at first.Every one was pleased and happy.But there, it had to be!There’s nothing to be gained by talking, though; you must act.”"
"就这样，戈利亚德金先生几乎决定了要采取某项行动。他到了家，一分钟也没耽搁，抓起他的烟斗，用尽全身力气吸着烟，向左右两边喷出一团团烟雾。他在屋里快速地来回踱着，内心极度激动。这时后，彼得鲁什卡开始收拾餐桌。最后，戈利亚德金先生终于完全下定了决心。他把烟斗扔到一边，穿上大衣，说他不在家吃晚饭了，接着就跑出了家。气喘吁吁的彼得鲁什卡在楼梯上追上戈利亚德金先生，把他落下的帽子给他拿来。戈利亚德金先生接过帽子，本想顺便对彼得鲁什卡说些什么，为自己的行为作个解释，免得彼得鲁什卡会胡思乱想，比如：“多奇怪！怎么连帽子都落下了，如此等等。”但是，彼得鲁什卡交给他帽子之后就立即走开了，看都没看他一眼，于是戈利亚德金先生戴上帽子，没有进一步解释。他跑下楼梯，一遍又一遍地告诉自己也许一切都会圆满解决，事情会通过某种方式安排妥当，虽然他此刻还感到脚底有一股凉气冒上来。他到了街上，叫了一辆马车，匆忙赶往安德雷·菲利波维奇家。","And so, almost resolved upon some action, Mr. Golyadkin reached home, and without a moment’s delay snatched up his pipe and, sucking at it with all his might and puffing out clouds of smoke to right and to left, he began pacing up and down the room in a state of violent excitement.Meanwhile, Petrushka began laying the table.At last Mr. Golyadkin made up his mind completely, flung aside his pipe, put on his overcoat, said he would not dine at home and ran out of the flat.Petrushka, panting, overtook him on the stairs, bringing the hat he had forgotten.Mr. Golyadkin took his hat, wanted to say something incidentally to justify himself in Petrushka’s eyes that the latter might not think anything particular, such as, “What a queer circumstance! here he forgot his hat — and so on,”but as Petrushka walked away at once and would not even look at him, Mr. Golyadkin put on his hat without further explanation, ran downstairs, and repeating to himself that perhaps everything might be for the best, and that affairs would somehow be arranged, though he was conscious among other things of a cold chill right down to his heels, he went out into the street, took a cab and hastened to Andrey Filippovitch’s."
"“不过，明天去不是更好吗？”戈利亚德金先生一边伸手去拉安德雷·菲利波维奇家的门铃绳，一边这么想着，“况且，我具体有什么要说呢？没有什么特别的事要说呀。这是一件如此糟糕的事情，是的，真的很糟糕，不值一提，是的，简直不值一提……是呀，这件事情就是这样，这件琐事……突然，戈利亚德金先生拉动了门铃。门铃响了，脚步声从里面传来……戈利亚德金先生立即就诅咒自己，怪自己的心急和冒失。他因为工作繁忙，几乎忘记了近来发生的那些不愉快的事情。他和安德雷·菲利波维奇的会面一下子涌现在他的脑海中。但是，此刻逃走已经太晚了，因为大门已经打开了。仆人告知他说安德雷·菲利波维奇还没有从办公室下班回来，也没有在家吃饭。这对戈利亚德金先生来说是个幸运的消息。","“Would it not be better tomorrow, though?” thought Mr. Golyadkin, as he took hold of the bell-rope of Andrey Filippovitch’s flat.“And, besides, what can I say in particular?There is nothing particular in it.It’s such a wretched affair, yes, it really is wretched, paltry, yes, that is, almost a paltry affair ... yes, that’s what it is, the incident ... Suddenly Mr. Golyadkin pulled at the bell; the bell rang; footsteps were heard within ... Mr. Golyadkin cursed himself on the spot for his hastiness and audacity.His recent unpleasant experiences, which he had almost forgotten over his work, and his encounter with Andrey Filippovitch immediately came back into his mind.But by now it was too late to run away: the door opened.Luckily for Mr. Golyadkin he was informed that Andrey Filippovitch had not returned from the office and had not dined at home."
"“我知道他在哪里用餐，就在伊兹梅洛夫桥附近。”我们的主人公心想，完全松了口气。仆人询问戈利亚德金先生要留下什么消息时，他说：“没什么事，大好人，我晚些时候再来拜访。”说完这些，他甚至兴致勃勃地跑下了门前的台阶。跑到外面街道上后，他决定给车夫结了帐，打发走他。车夫以在街上等候为由，还说为了等候大人，都没让马休息，向他索要额外费用。戈利亚德金先生给车夫加了五个戈比，心里甚至还很乐意。然后，他往前走去。","“I know where he dines: he dines near the Ismailovsky Bridge,” thought our hero; and he was immensely relieved.To the footman’s inquiry what message he would leave, he said: “It’s all right, my good man, I’ll look in later,” and he even ran downstairs with a certain cheerful briskness.Going out into the street, he decided to dismiss the cab and paid the driver.When the man asked for something extra, saying he had been waiting in the street and had not spared his horse for his honour, he gave him five kopecks extra, and even willingly; and then walked on."
"戈利亚德金先生心想：“这事情确实不能就这样算了。不过，如果要那样看，理性地考虑，我现在为什么要在这儿瞎忙活呢？嗯，是的，不过，我要继续说说我为什么要这么不辞辛劳，为什么我要奔波，弄得自己筋疲力竭，让自己担心忧虑，耗尽精力。首先，这事情已经做了，再想也没有用了……当然，后悔也是没有用的！让我们这样想：出现了一个受贵人推荐的人，据说他是个很能干的职员，品行优良，只是家境贫寒，经历过很多坎坷——各种各样的起起伏伏——嗯，贫穷不是一种罪过。结果是，我必须靠边站了。唉，这简直是胡说八道！嗯，他来了。他的造化，上天把他创造地和另一个人十分相像，简直就如两滴水那么相像，就像是另一个人的完美复制品。他们怎能因为这个原因而拒绝他来司里工作？如果命运是这样安排的，如果只是命运的原因，如果只能怪瞎了眼的时机——那就该把他当一片破布头来对待，应该拒绝给他这个工作吗？……唉，如果是那样的话，还有什么公道可言？他是一个贫穷、无助、遭遇低谷的人。这些足以使人心痛。同情心也要求人照顾他。是的！无可否认，如果上司们的想法和我这个无赖一样的话，他们就真了不起了！我这个傻瓜！十几个人加起来也没我傻！是的，就是这样！他们做得很对，多谢他们善待一个贫穷的倒霉蛋。啊，我们这么想一下，假如我们是孪生兄弟，生来就是双胞胎兄弟，仅此而已——对了！嗯，这又怎样？唉，没什么！所有的职员都会对此习以为常的。来我们办公室的外人在这种情况下也肯定不会发觉有什么不妥的地方，或有什么失礼冒犯的地方。事实上，这真是件令人感动的事情。想想，神圣的上帝创造了两个完全相同的人，而且司里的领导领会了这个神圣的天作，收容了这两个兄弟。当然是这个样子。”戈利亚德金先生继续想着，深深吸了一口气，压低了声音：“当然是这样。也许情况会更好，如果……如果没有这感人的善行，如果也不是孪生兄弟……但愿魔鬼把这一切都抓去！有什么必要性呢？有什么特别的需求要求刻不容缓呢！上帝！这一切都是魔鬼在捣鬼！另外，他连性格也和我一样，既有贪玩的一面，也有恐怖的一面。他是个敏捷矫健的无赖。他还很能拍马屁！一个十足的马屁精！他就是另一个戈利亚德金！我猜，他会行为出轨。是的，这个流氓，他将会玷污我的名字。现在，我还得去照顾他，照应他！真是折磨呀！但是，毕竟，这又怎么样？这没什么关系。就算他是个混蛋，嗯，就让他当一个恶棍好了。但所幸的是，另一个却很诚实。所以，他会是个恶棍，我会是个诚实的人。他们会说，这个戈利亚德金是个混蛋，咱们别理他，也不要把他和另一个戈利亚德金弄混了。另一个戈利亚德金诚实、高尚、温和、宽容，办事值得信赖，应当给予升职。就是这样，很好……但是，如果……如果他们把我们两个弄混了怎么办！他可什么事情都做得出来。啊，上帝，救救我们吧！他会假冒别人，他会偷梁换柱，那个混蛋——他会把一个人变为另一个人，就像他是块破布一样，完全不会想到人不是破布。啊，可怜可怜我们吧！啊，多么不幸呀！”","“It really is such a thing,” thought Mr. Golyadkin, “that it cannot be left like that; though, if one looks at it that way, looks at it sensibly, why am I hurrying about here, in reality?Well, yes, though, I will go on discussing why I should take a lot of trouble; why I should rush about, exert myself, worry myself and wear myself out.To begin with, the thing’s done and there’s no recalling it ... of course, there’s no recalling it!Let us put it like this: a man turns up with a satisfactory reference, said to be a capable clerk, of good conduct, only he is a poor man and has suffered many reverses — all sorts of ups and downs — well, poverty is not a crime: so I must stand aside.Why, what nonsense it is!Well, he came; he is so made, the man is so made by nature itself that he is as like another man as though they were two drops of water, as though he were a perfect copy of another man; how could they refuse to take him into the department on that account?If it is fate, if it is only fate, if it only blind chance that is to blame — is he to be treated like a rag, is he to be refused a job in the office?... Why, what would become of justice after that?He is a poor man, hopeless, downcast; it makes one’s heart ache: compassion bids one care for him!Yes!Yes! There’s no denying, there would be a fine set of head officials, if they took the same view as a reprobate like me!What an addlepate I am!I have foolishness enough for a dozen!Yes, yes!They did right, and many thanks to them for being good to a poor, luckless fellow ... Why, let us imagine for a moment that we are twins, that we had been born twin brothers, and nothing else — there it is!Well, what of it?Why, nothing!All the clerks can get used to it ... And an outsider, coming into our office, would certainly find nothing unseemly or offensive in the circumstance.In fact, there is really something touching it; to think that the divine Providence created two men exactly alike, and the heads of the department, seeing the divine handiwork, provided for two twins.It would, of course,” Mr. Golyadkin went on, drawing a breath and dropping his voice, “it would, of course ... it would, of course, have been better if there had been ... if there had been nothing of this touching kindness, and if there had been no twins either ... The devil take it all!And what need was there for it?And what was the particular necessity that admitted of no delay!My goodness!The devil has made a mess of it!Besides, he has such a character, too, he’s of such a playful, horrid disposition — he’s such a scoundrel, he’s such a nimble fellow!He’s such a toady!Such a lickspittle!He’s such a Golyadkin!I daresay he will misconduct himself; yes, he’ll disgrace my name, the blackguard!And now I have to look after him and wait upon him!What an infliction!But, after all, what of it?It doesn’t matter.Granted, he’s a scoundrel, well, let him be a scoundrel, but to make up for it, the other one’s honest; so he will be a scoundrel and I’ll be honest, and they’ll say that this Golyadkin’s a rascal, don’t take any notice of him, and don’t mix him up with the other; but the other one’s honest, virtuous, mild, free from malice, always to be relied upon in the service, and worthy of promotion; that’s how it is, very good ... but what if ... what if they get us mixed up!... He is equal to anything!Ah, Lord, have mercy upon us!... He will counterfeit a man, he will counterfeit him, the rascal — he will change one man for another as though he were a rag, and not reflect that a man is not a rag.Ach, mercy on us!Ough, what a calamity!” ..."
"戈利亚德金先生一边这样想着，悲伤着，一边漫无目的地向前跑。他恢复意识的时候，已经跑到了涅瓦大街。他清醒的原因是他碰巧结结实实地撞到了一个路上的身上，两眼直冒金星。戈利亚德金先生头也不抬地低声道了歉。直到那位路人嘟囔了些不太好听的话，走了好远后，戈利亚德金先生才抬起头，四处看看自己的位置，想自己怎么会到这里来了。他环顾四周时，注意到他旁边是个饭馆，他在奥尔苏菲·伊万诺维奇家的晚宴前曾进去坐过一会儿。我们的主人公突然感觉胃里有什么东西在抓挠。他想起自己还没有吃饭。而他也没有什么晚宴可赴。因此，他没有浪费宝贵的时间，跑到楼上的饭馆里。他想尽可能快地随便吃点什么东西。他分秒必争，不想浪费时间。虽然这家饭馆里的所有东西都很贵，但是，这点小事这回并没有让戈利亚德金先生迟疑。事实上，他也没有时间在这样的小事情上面迟疑。在这灯光明亮的饭馆里，顾客在柜台前站成一群。柜台上摆放着一大堆食品，种类多样，为教养良好的人提供午餐。服务员给顾客倒酒、服侍、收钱和找零，简直忙不过来。戈利亚德金先生排队等候。轮到他时，他谦逊地伸出手来，要了个可口的小馅饼。他窝到一个角落里，背对着其他顾客坐下，津津有味地吃起来。吃完后，他又来到掌柜跟前，把盘子下。他知道馅饼的价格，就拿出一个值十个戈比的币，放到柜台上。他看着掌柜的眼睛，似乎在说：“看，这是饭钱，一个馅饼。”等等，诸如此类。","Reflecting and lamenting in this way, Mr. Golyadkin ran on, regardless of where he was going.He came to his senses in Nevsky Prospect, only owing to the chance that he ran so neatly full-tilt into a passer-by that he saw stars in his eyes.Mr. Golyadkin muttered his excuses without raising his head, and it was only after the passer-by, muttering something far from flattering, had walked a considerable distance away, that he raised his nose and looked about to see where he was and how he had got there.Noticing when he did so that he was close to the restaurant in which he had sat for a while before the dinner-party at Olsufy Ivanovitch’s, our hero was suddenly conscious of a pinching and nipping sensation in his stomach; he remembered that he had not dined; he had no prospect of a dinner-party anywhere.And so, without losing precious time, he ran upstairs into the restaurant to have a snack of something as quickly as possible, and to avoid delay by making all the haste he could.And though everything in the restaurant was rather dear, that little circumstance did not on this occasion make Mr. Golyadkin pause, and, indeed, he had no time to pause over such a trifle.In the brightly lighted room the customers were standing in rather a crowd round the counter, upon which lay heaps of all sorts of such edibles as are eaten by well-bred person’s at lunch.The waiter scarcely had time to fill glasses, to serve, to take money and give change.Mr. Golyadkin waited for his turn and modestly stretched out his had for a savoury patty.Retreating into a corner, turning his back on the company and eating with appetite, he went back to the attendant, put down his plate and, knowing the price, took out a ten-kopeck piece and laid the coin on the counter, catching the waiter’s eye as though to say, “Look, here’s the money, one pie,” and so on."
"“您该付一卢布十戈比。”掌柜从牙缝挤出这样的话来。","“One rouble ten kopecks is your bill,” the waiter filtered through his teeth."
"戈利亚德金先生十分地诧异。","Mr. Golyadkin was a good deal surprised."
"“你在对我说话吗？我……我相信我只拿了一个馅饼。”","“You are speaking to me?... I ... I took one pie, I believe.”"
"“您拿了十一个。”掌柜十分确信地说。","“You’ve had eleven,” the man said confidently."
"“你……我觉得……我想你是弄错了……我真的只拿了一个馅饼，我想。”","“You ... so it seems to me ... I believe, you’re mistaken ... I really took only one pie, I think.”"
"“我数过了，您拿了十一个。既然您吃了，就必须付帐。我们这儿不白白施舍。”","“I counted them; you took eleven.Since you’ve had them you must pay for them; we don’t give anything away for nothing.”"
"戈利亚德金先生愣住了。“这是怎么回事？难道有人对我施了魔法？”他想。同时，掌柜正等着戈利亚德金先生作决定。其他人也围住了戈利亚德金先生。他在口袋里已经摸到了一个银卢布，要立即付了全额，免得再惹麻烦。“好吧，十一个就十一个吧。”他想着，脸涨得通红，就像龙虾一样，“唉，人家饿了，就吃十一个馅饼呀。那就让他吃，希望能满足他。没有什么可大惊小怪的，没有什么好嘲笑的……”","Mr. Golyadkin was petrified.“What sorcery is this, what is happening to me?” he wondered.Meanwhile, the man waited for Mr. Golyadkin to make up his mind; people crowded round Mr. Golyadkin; he was already feeling in his pocket for a silver rouble, to pay the full amount at once, to avoid further trouble.“Well, if it was eleven, it was eleven,” he thought, turning as red as a lobster.“Why, a man’s hungry, so he eats eleven pies; well, let him eat, and may it do him good; and there’s nothing to wonder at in that, and there’s nothing to laugh at ... ”"
"这时，好像有什么东西刺了戈利亚德金先生一下。他抬起头望去——立即明白了刚才那个谜。他明白了刚才那个魔法是怎么回事了。所有的疑团都解开了……","At that moment something seemed to stab Mr. Golyadkin.He raised his eyes and — at once he guessed the riddle.He knew what the sorcery was.All his difficulties were solved ..."
"有一个人站在隔壁屋子的门口处，几乎正好背对着掌柜，正对着戈利亚德金先生。在此之前，我们的主人公以为那是一面镜子。他站着，戈利亚德金先生也站着——不过，他不是原来的戈利亚德金先生，不是我们的主人公，而是另一个戈利亚德金先生，一个新的戈利亚德金先生。另一位戈利亚德金先生看起来精神焕发。他对原来的戈利亚德金先生微笑，朝他点头，对他使眼色，脚步微微滑动，看起来似乎下一分钟就会消失，溜进隔壁的房间，然后或许再从后门出去。而且他会如愿，没有人能追上他。他手里还捏着第十个馅饼的最后一小块，就在戈利亚德金先生的眼前塞进了嘴里，而且还咂着嘴。","In the doorway of the next room, almost directly behind the waiter and facing Mr. Golyadkin, in the doorway which, till that moment, our hero had taken for a looking-glass, a man was standing — he was standing, Mr. Golyadkin was standing — not the original Mr. Golyadkin, the hero of our story, but the other Mr. Golyadkin, the new Mr. Golyadkin.The second Mr. Golyadkin was apparently in excellent spirits.He smiled to Mr. Golyadkin the first, nodded to him, winked, shuffled his feet a little, and looked as though in another minute he would vanish, would disappear into the next room, and then go out, maybe, by a back way out; and there it would be, and all pursuit would be in vain.In his hand he had the last morsel of the tenth pie, and before Mr. Golyadkin’s very eyes he popped it into his mouth and smacked his lips."
"“他冒充我，这个流氓！”戈利亚德金先生想着，羞愧得脸通红，“他不怕在公众面前丢脸！他们看见他了么？我想没有人注意到他……”","“He had impersonated me, the scoundrel!” thought Mr. Golyadkin, flushing hot with shame.“He is not ashamed of the publicity of it!Do they see him?I fancy no one notices him ... ”"
"戈利亚德金先生扔下他的卢布，好像是手指被它烫到了似的。他没有注意掌柜那别有用意的傲慢的笑——带有一种胜利和无声的力量——他只是挤出人群，头也不回地跑开了。“还得感谢他呢，至少他没让我弄得太狼狈。”老戈利亚德金先生这么想，“谢谢这强盗，也要谢谢命运，总算一切事情都圆满解决了。只能怪这老板太野蛮了。但是，毕竟他有理。他就是该收一卢布十戈比，所以他有理。他说：‘我们不白白施舍。’他也应该客气点嘛，这个混蛋……”","Mr. Golyadkin threw down his rouble as though it burnt his fingers, and without noticing the waiter’s insolently significant grin, a smile of triumph and serene power, he extricated himself from the crowd, and rushed away without looking round.“We must be thankful that at least he has not completely compromised anyone!” thought Mr. Golyadkin senior.“We must be thankful to him, the brigand, and to fate, that everything was satisfactorily settled.The waiter was rude, that was all.But, after all, he was in the right.One rouble and ten kopecks were owing: so he was in the right.‘We don’t give things away for nothing,’ he said!Though he might have been more polite, the rascal ...”"
"戈利亚德金先生就这样自言自语着，走下通往门口的台阶。但走到最后一级台阶时，他突然停了下来，好像中了枪一样。他突然满脸通红，最后眼睛里充满了泪水，因为他的自尊受到了侮辱。静静地站了半分钟后，他坚定地跺了一下脚，一下从台阶上跃到街上，直冲冲地往家跑，气喘吁吁，却也感觉不到累。回到家里后，他没有换掉外套，虽然往日他习惯换上一件旧外套。他甚至也不停下来去拿烟斗，而是坐在沙发上，拿过墨水瓶，拿起笔，找出一沓信纸。怀着激动的心情，他用颤抖的手开始草草写下下面这封信：","All this Mr. Golyadkin said to himself as he went downstairs to the entrance, but on the last step he stopped suddenly, as though he had been shot, and suddenly flushed till the tears came into his eyes at the insult to his dignity.After standing stockstill for half a minute, he stamped his foot, resolutely, at one bound leapt from the step into the street and, without looking round, rushed breathless and unconscious of fatigue back home, without changing his coat, though it was his habit to change into an old coat at home, without even stopping to take his pipe, he sat down on the sofa, drew the inkstand towards him, took up a pen, got a sheet of notepaper, and with a hand that trembled from inward excitement, began scribbling the following epistle,"
"“亲爱的雅科夫·彼得罗维奇先生：","“Dear Sir Yakov Petrovitch!"
"若非我当前的状况和您的行为迫使我提笔给您写信，我是不会走到这一步的。请相信，我写这封信与您探讨是出于必要，并非别有他因。因此，首先，我请求先生您不要把我的这一举动看成是对您有预谋的侮辱，现实状况把我们连接在一起，必然会出现这样的结果。”","“I should not take up my pen if my circumstances, and your own action, sir, had not compelled me to that step.Believe me that nothing but necessity would have induced me to enter upon such a discussion with you and therefore, first of all, I beg you, sir, to look upon this step of mine not as a premeditated design to insult you, but as the inevitable consequence of the circumstance that is a bond between us now.”"
"（写完上面的话，戈利亚德金先生又读了一遍，心想：“我觉得这封信写得很好，得体，客气，但也不乏力量和果断……我觉得这样写对他没什么冒犯之处。此外，我有权写这封信。”）","(“I think that’s all right, proper courteous, though not lacking in force and firmness ... I don’t think there is anything for him to take offence at. Besides, I’m fully within my rights,” thought Mr. Golyadkin, reading over what he had written.)"
"“先生，我的敌人粗暴地对待我，行为过分，我无比蔑视他们，甚至不想提及他们的名字。之后，你在暴风雨之夜突然奇怪的出现成了我们目前误会的导火线。先生，您顽固地要坚持自己的行为，硬要闯入我的生活圈子和我的生活关系，这一行为越过了最起码的礼貌界限和文明社会的每条规则。先生，我想我也没有必要再指出您如何盗用我的文稿，尤其是利用我的好名声，获取我的上司的厚爱——你不配得到这些厚爱。我在此也没有必要提及您故意、无礼地拒绝对我们之间的这些事给出一个必要的解释。最后，为了节省笔墨以言其他，我也不再提上次您在咖啡馆，对我做出的奇怪，甚至可以说是莫名其妙的行为。我绝不是在抱怨我无谓地——对我来说——多花了一个卢布。我只是忍不住想表达一下我的愤慨。您在公众面前凌辱我，损害我的荣誉。而且更重要的是，当时在场的还有几位教养良好的人，虽然我不认识他们。”","“Your strange and sudden appearance, sir, on a stormy night, after the coarse and unseemly behaviour of my enemies to me, for whom I feel too much contempt even to mention their names, was the starting-point of all the misunderstanding existing between us at the present time.Your obstinate desire to persist in your course of action, sir, and forcibly to enter the circle of my existence and all my relations in practical life, transgresses every limit imposed by the merest politeness and every rule of civilized society.I imagine there is no need, sir, for me to refer to the seizure by you of my papers, and particularly to your taking away my good name, in order to gain the favour of my superiors — favour you have not deserved.There is no need to refer here either to your intentional and insulting refusal of the necessary explanation in regard to us.Finally, to omit nothing, I will not allude here to your last strange, one may even say, your incomprehensible behaviour to me in the coffee-house.I am far from lamenting over the needless — for me — loss of a rouble; but I cannot help expressing my indignation at the recollection of your public outrage upon me, to the detriment of my honour, and what is more, in the presence of several persons of good breeding, though not belonging to my circle of acquaintance.”"
"（“我是不是扯地太远了？”戈利亚德金先生心里想，“我是不是说太多了？我是不是太无礼了——比方说，我用良好的教养嘲笑他？……不过也没什么，没什么关系！我必须向他展示我性格的坚决。但是，在信的结尾，我也许要缓和他的心情，奉承他几句，讨他的欢心。就这样吧，我们看着办吧。”）","(“Am I not going too far?” thought Mr. Golyadkin.“Isn’t it too much; won’t it be too insulting — that taunt about good breeding, for instance?... But there, it doesn’t matter!I must show him the resoluteness of my character.I might, however, to soften him, flatter him, and butter him up at the end.But there, we shall see.”)"
"“先生，我不该用这封信来使您劳神，但是我坚信，您高贵的感情和开放正直的性格将会向您指出一个拨乱反正的解决办法。","“But I should not weary you with my letter, sir, if I were not firmly convinced that the nobility of your sentiments and your open, candid character would suggest to you yourself a means for retrieving all lapses and returning everything to its original position."
"我有充分的信心，于是冒昧地相信您一定不会把我的信理解为贬低您。同时，我也相信，在这种情况下，您不会拒绝用书信作出解释。回信可交给我的仆人。","“With full confidence I venture to rest assured that you will not take my letter in a sense derogatory to yourself, and at the same time that you will not refuse to explain yourself expressly on this occasion by letter, sending the same by my man."
"期盼您的回信，谨向先生致意。","“In expectation of your reply, I have the honour, dear sir, to remain,"
"雅·戈利亚德金敬上”","“Your humble servant, Y. Golyadkin.”"
"","“Y.“Y. Golyadkin.”"
"“啊，还不错。事情解决了，发展到了用书信形式解决。但怪谁呢？都怪他自己：他自己的行为弄得别人必须诉诸书面信函来解决。而且我有权……”","“Well, that is quite all right.The thing’s done, it has come to letter-writing.But who is to blame for that?He is to blame himself: by his own action he reduces a man to the necessity of resorting to epistolary composition.And I am within my rights...”"
"戈利亚德金先生最后一次通读了一遍信，把信折好，封住，叫彼得鲁什卡过来。彼得鲁什卡来了。他和往常一样，看起来困倦，为某件事情而闷闷不乐。","Reading over his letter for the last time, Mr. Golyadkin folded it up, sealed it and called Petrushka.Petrushka came in looking, as usual, sleepy and cross about something."
"“孩子，你把这封信送过去，你明白吗？”","“You will take this letter, my boy ... do you understand?”"
"彼得鲁什卡默不作声。","Petrushka did not speak."
"“你把这封信送到司里去。到那儿，你务必找到值班秘书瓦赫拉梅耶夫。他今天值班。你明白吗？”","“You will take it to the department; there you must find the secretary on duty, Vahramyev.He is the one on duty today.Do you understand that?”"
"“我明白。”","“I understand.”"
"“‘我明白了’！你甚至不说：‘我明白了，先生’！你先找瓦赫拉梅耶夫秘书，告诉他你的主人要你向他问好，并谦卑地请他查一下办公室的地址簿，找到小文官戈利亚德金的住址。明白吗？”","“‘I understand’!He can’t even say, ‘I understand, sir!’You must ask the secretary, Vahramyev, and tell him that your master desired you to send his regards, and humbly requests him to refer to the address book of our office and find out where the titular councillor, Golyadkin, is living?”"
"彼得鲁什卡依旧不语。戈利亚德金先生觉得他似乎微笑了一下。","Petrushka remained mute, and, as Mr. Golyadkin fancied, smiled."
"“嗯，你明白，彼得，你一定要向他问到地址，查到戈利亚德金这位新职员的住址。”","“Well, so you see, Pyotr, you have to ask him for the address, and find out where the new clerk, Golyadkin, lives.”"
"“是。”","“Yes.”"
"“你一定要问到地址，然后把这封信送到。你明白了吧？”","“You must ask for the address and then take this letter there.Do you understand?”"
"“明白。”","“I understand.”"
"“如果到那里……就是你要送信的那个地方，你要把信送给戈利亚德金先生……你这个笨蛋在笑什么？”","“If there ... where you have to take the letter, that gentleman to whom you have to give the letter, that Golyadkin ... What are you laughing at, you blockhead?”"
"“我笑什么？我为什么要笑？我什么也没做，先生。我们这些下人可不能笑……”","“What is there to laugh at?What is it to me!I wasn’t doing anything, sir. it’s not for the likes of us to laugh…”it’s not for the likes of us to laugh...”"
"“哦，那么……如果那位先生问：‘你家主人怎么样？他还好吧？’如果他……嗯，如果他问起你什么——你别多嘴，就回答说：‘我家主人很好，他请您回复他的信件。’你明白了吗？”","“Oh, well ... if that gentleman should ask, ‘How is your master, how is he’; if he ... well, if he should ask you anything — you hold your tongue, and answer, ‘My master is all right and begs you for an answer to his letter.’Do you understand?”"
"“明白，老爷。”","“Yes, sir.”"
"“嗯，那，就说：‘我家主人一切都好，很健康。’还说：‘正要去拜访别人，他请求您书面回复他。’你明白吗？”","“Well, then, say, ‘My master is all right and quite well,’ say ‘and is just getting ready to pay a call: and he asks you,’ say, ‘for an answer in writing.’Do you understand?”"
"“明白了。”","“Yes.”"
"“好，那就去吧。”","“Well, go along, then.”"
"“唉，这个笨蛋仆人真是让我费心！他居然嘲笑我，我却拿他没办法。他嘲笑什么呢？我算是倒霉透顶了。唉，我算是倒霉透了。不过，也许一切都会好起来……我想这个混蛋大概要晃荡两个多小时，他会跑到别的地方去……简直没发指望他办成什么事情。真悲惨！……我真是个倒霉蛋！”","“Why, what a bother I have with this blockhead too!He’s laughing, and there’s nothing to be done.What’s he laughing at?I’ve lived to see trouble.Here I’ve lived like this to see trouble.Though perhaps it may all turn out for the best...That rascal will be loitering about for the next two hours now, I expect; he’ll go off somewhere else...There’s no sending him anywhere.What a misery it is!... What misery has come upon me!”"
"我们的主人公一边想着自己倒霉透顶，一边决定被动地等待两个小时，等彼得鲁什卡回来再说。他在房间里踱来踱去，抽烟，又放下烟斗，坐下来看书。过了一会儿，他在沙发上躺下，然后又一次拿起烟斗，接着又继续在房间里来回走。就这样，一个小时过去了。他试图把问题思考清楚，可完全无法思考任何事。最后，这种被动等待的痛苦发展到了极点。戈利亚德金先生下定决心采取行动。“彼得鲁什卡一个小时之后肯定回来。”他想，“我可以把钥匙交给看门人，我自己可以，这么说吧……我可以亲自去调查一下这件事情。我要用自己的方式调查这件事。”","Feeling his troubles to the full, our hero made up his mind to remain passive for two hours till Petrushka returned.For an hour of the time he walked about the room, smoked, then put aside his pipe and sat down to a book, then he lay down on the sofa, then took up his pipe again, then again began running about the room.He tried to think things over but was absolutely unable to think about anything.At last the agony of remaining passive reached the climax and Mr. Golyadkin made up his mind to take a step.“Petrushka will come in another hour,” he thought.“I can give the key to the porter, and I myself can, so to speak ... I can investigate the matter: I shall investigate the matter in my own way.”"
"戈利亚德金先生没有耽搁时间，急着要调查这件事。他拿起帽子，走出房间，锁上了房门。他走到看门人那里，把钥匙连同十个戈比交给了他——最近，戈利亚德金先生变得出奇地慷慨——然后就匆匆忙忙地出发了。戈利亚德金先生首先步行走到了伊兹梅洛夫桥。他大约用了半个小时才走到那里。走到目的地后，他直接走进公寓的院子，他对这个公寓很熟悉。他抬头看了看市政议员贝伦捷耶夫家的窗户。除了三个挂着红色窗帘的窗户外，其余的都一片黑暗。","Without loss of time, in haste to investigate the matter, Mr. Golyadkin took his hat, went out of the room, locked up his flat, went in to the porter, gave him the key, together with ten kopecks — Mr. Golyadkin had become extraordinarily free-handed of late — and rushed off.Mr. Golyadkin went first on foot to the Ismailovsky Bridge.It took him half an hour to get there.When he reached to goal of his journey he went straight into the yard of the house so familiar to him, and glanced up at the windows of the civil councillor Berendyev’s flat.Except for three windows hung with red curtains all the rest was dark."
"“奥尔苏菲·伊万诺维奇今天没有客人，”戈利亚德金先生这么想着，“他们全家人一定都在家。”","“Olsufy Ivanovitch has no visitors today,” thought Mr. Golyadkin; “they must all be staying at home today.”"
"在院子里站了一会儿，我们的主人公想着下一步怎么走。但显然，他没有作出决定。戈利亚德金先生改变了主意。他挥了一下手，走回到了街上。","After standing for some time in the yard, our hero tried to decide on some course of action. but he was apparently not destined to reach a decision.but he was apparently not destined to reach a decision.Mr. Golyadkin changed his mind, and with a wave of his hand went back into the street."
"“不，我今天没必要来这里。我在这儿能干什么？……不，我最好，这么说吧……我要亲自调查一下这事情。”","“No, there’s no need for me to go today.What could I do here?... No, I’d better, so to speak ... I’ll investigate the matter personally.”"
"这个决定作出之后，戈利亚德金先生向办公室飞奔。路途有点远。道路相当泥泞。而且，地上到处堆积着潮湿的雪。但是，对我们的主人公来说，似乎此刻这一切都不成问题。他浑身湿透了，这一点也不假。而且，他全身溅满了泥浆。","Coming to this conclusion, Mr. Golyadkin rushed off to his office.He had a long way to go.It was horribly muddy, besides, and the wet snow lay about in thick drifts.But it seemed as though difficulty did not exist for our hero at the moment.He was drenched through, it is true, and he was a good deal spattered with mud."
"“但这些都没关系，只要我的目的达到了。”","“But that’s no matter, so long as the object is obtained.”"
"戈利亚德金先生的确离他的目标越来越近了。政府高大的楼房黑乎乎地伫立在他眼前。","And Mr. Golyadkin certainly was nearing his goal.The dark mass of the huge government building stood up black before his eyes."
"“慢，”他心想，“我这是要去哪里？我来这儿要做什么？假设我真的查明了他的住址，然后呢？这期间，彼得鲁什卡也一定回来了，而且给我带回了回信。我只是在浪费我宝贵的时间，我仅仅是在浪费我的时间。不过，也许我应该进去看看瓦赫拉梅耶夫？不了，算了吧，我改日再来……哎呀！根本就用不着出来。只是，唉，我的性格就是如此！我总是抓着机会就往前冲，不管有没有必要……噢……什么时辰了？现在一定有九点了。彼得鲁什卡可能已经回来了，在家找不到我。我真是愚蠢至极才出来……哎呀，真是个麻烦事！”","“Stay,” he thought; “where am I going, and what am I going to do here?Suppose I do find out where he lives?Meanwhile, Petrushka will certainly have come back and brought me the answer.I am only wasting my precious time, I am simply wasting my time.Though shouldn’t I, perhaps, go in and see Vahramyev?But, no, I’ll go later...Ech!There was no need to have gone out at all.But, there, it’s my temperament!I’ve a knack of always seizing a chance of rushing ahead of things, whether there is a need to or not...H’m! ... what time is it?It must be nine by now.Petrushka might come and not find me at home.It was pure folly on my part to go out...Ech, it is really a nuisance!”"
"我们的主人公诚心诚意地认识到自己的愚蠢行为是错误的，他掉头跑回六铺街去。他跑到那儿时，已经精疲力竭。他从看门人那儿得知，彼得鲁什卡根本没想着要这么早回来。","Sincerely acknowledging that he had been guilty of an act of folly, our hero ran back to Shestilavotchny Street.He arrived there, weary and exhausted.From the porter he learned that Petrushka has not dreamed of turning up yet."
"“当然是这样！我早知道会这样。”我们的主人公想。就在这时，钟敲响了九下。“唉，这个没用的家伙！他总是在某个地方喝酒。上帝呀，可怜可怜我吧！我悲惨的命运又遇上这么倒霉的一天！”","“To be sure!I foresaw it would be so,” thought our hero; and meanwhile it’s nine o’clock.“Ech, he’s such a good-for-nothing chap!He’s always drinking somewhere!Mercy on us!What a day had fallen to my miserable lot!”"
"戈利亚德金先生就这么想着，打开了房门，点了根蜡烛，脱掉外套，点燃了烟斗。他觉得很累，筋疲力尽，真是又累又饿，就躺在沙发上等彼得鲁什卡回来。昏暗的烛光在墙上摇曳着……戈利亚德金先生看呀看，想呀想，最后睡着了，一点力气也没了。","Reflecting in this way, Mr. Golyadkin unlocked his flat, got a light, took off his outdoor things, lighted his pipe and, tired, worn-out, exhausted and hungry, lay down on the sofa and waited for Petrushka.The candle burnt dimly; the light flickered on the wall...Mr. Golyadkin gazed and gazed, and thought and thought, and fell asleep at last, worn out."
"他醒来时，天已经很晚了。蜡烛几乎燃尽了，冒着烟，马上就要熄灭了。戈利亚德金先生纵身跳起来，晃晃身体，一切都想起来了，所有的一切。隔板后面传来彼得鲁什卡震天的鼾声。戈利亚德金先生一个箭步跑到窗户前——却发现没有一处亮光。他打开窗户——万籁俱静。整个城市如同死亡般沉睡着，因此估计现在一定是午夜两三点。果然，隔板后的钟敲了两下。戈利亚德金先生迅速跑到隔板后。","It was late when he woke up.The candle had almost burnt down, was smoking and on the point of going out.Mr. Golyadkin jumped up, shook himself, and remembered it all, absolutely all.behind the screen he heard Petrushka snoring lustily.Mr. Golyadkin rushed to the window — not a light anywhere.he opened the movable pane — all was still; the city was asleep as though it were dead: so it must have been two or three o’clock; so it proved to be, indeed; the clock behind the partition made an effort and struck two.Mr. Golyadkin rushed behind the partition."
"无论如何，经过很长时间的努力，他终于把彼得鲁什卡弄醒了，让他在床上坐了起来。就在这时，蜡烛正好完全燃尽了。又过了大约十分钟，戈利亚德金先生才找到另一根蜡烛，并点燃了它。就这会儿功夫，彼得鲁什卡又睡着了。","He succeeded, somehow, though only after great exertions, in rousing Petrushka, and making him sit up in his bed.At that moment the candle went out completely.About ten minutes passed before Mr. Golyadkin succeeded in finding another candle and lighting it.In the interval Petrushka had fallen asleep again."
"“你这混蛋，你这没用的家伙！”戈利亚德金先生说道，又摇晃起他来，“起来行吗？醒醒呀！”经过半个小时的努力，戈利亚德金先生好不容易才把他从隔板后拖了出来，虽然把所有的仆人也都吵醒了。直到这时候，我们的主人公才发现彼得鲁什卡正是所谓的“醉如死猪”，两腿几乎站不稳。","“You scoundrel, you worthless fellow!” said Mr. Golyadkin, shaking him up again.“Will you get up, will you wake?”After half an hour of effort Mr. Golyadkin succeeded, however, in rousing his servant thoroughly, and dragging him out from behind the partition.Only then, our hero remarked the fact that Petrushka was what is called dead-drunk and could hardly stand on his legs."
"“你这没用的东西！”戈利亚德金先生大叫道，“你这个无赖！你这是要了我的命呀！主啊！他把我的信弄到哪儿去了？哎呀，我的上帝！信在哪儿？……我为什么要写这封信？难道我写这封信有什么必要吗？我就像个大傻瓜一样为了我的骄傲乱写一气！我为了面子把自己陷入这样的困境！这就是爱面子的后果，你这个流氓，这就是面子！……喂，你这个无赖，你把信到底整哪里去了？你把信交给谁了？”","“You good-for-nothing fellow!” cried Mr. Golyadkin; “you ruffian!You’ll be the death of me!Good heavens!whatever has he done with the letter?Ach, my God! where is it?where is it?... And why did I write it?As though there were any need for me to have written it!I went scribbling away out of pride, like a noodle!I’ve got myself into this fix out of pride!That is what dignity does for you, you rascal, that is dignity!... Come, what have you done with the letter, you ruffian?To whom did you give it?”"
"“我没有把什么信交给任何人。我从来也不知道有什么信……就是这样！”","“I didn’t give any one any letter; and I never had any letter ... so there!”"
"戈利亚德金先生绝望地扭绞着双手。","Mr. Golyadkin wrung his hands in despair."
"“听着，彼得……你给我听好了，你给我听着……”","“Listen, Pyotr ... listen to me, listen to me ...”"
"“我听着了……”","“I am listening ...”"
"“你去哪里了？回答我……”","“Where have you been? — answer…”— answer ...”"
"“我去哪儿了……我去见好人了！我怎么啦？”","“Where have I been ... I’ve been to see good people!What is it to me!”"
"“噢，主啊，可怜可怜我们吧！你先去哪儿了？你去司里了没有？……听着，彼得，也许你是喝醉了吧？”","“Oh, Lord, have mercy on us!Where did you go, to begin with?Did you go to the department?... Listen, Pyotr, perhaps you’re drunk?”"
"“我醉了？我要是醉了，就让我立刻死在这儿。我没喝酒，一滴都没喝——就这样……”","“Me drunk!If I should be struck on the spot this minute, not a drop, not a drop — so there...”"
"“不，不是的，你喝醉了也没关系……我只是问问而已。你醉了也没有关系。我不介意，彼得鲁什卡， 我不介意……可能你只是忘记了，但是你会记起所有事情的。来，你努力想想看——你是不是去过瓦赫拉梅耶夫职员那里？你去找他了没有？”","“No, no, it’s no matter you’re being drunk...I only asked; it’s all right your being drunk; I don’t mind, Petrushka, I don’t mind...Perhaps it’s only that you have forgotten, but you’ll remember it all.Come, try to remember — have you been to that clerk’s, to Vahramyev’s; have you been to him or not?”"
"“我没去，也没有这个职员。哪怕让我立刻……”","“I have not been, and there’s no such clerk.Not if I were this minute ...”"
"“不，不，彼得！不，彼得鲁什卡，你知道我并不介意的。嗯，你看，我不介意……快告诉我，发生了什么事？当然了，街上又冷又潮，所以一个男人去喝几口，这也没什么。我不生气。我今天自己也喝酒了，孩子……快点，想想，努力回忆，你去瓦赫拉梅耶夫那儿了吗？”","“No, no, Pyotr!No, Petrushka, you know I don’t mind.Why, you see I don’t mind...Come, what happened?To be sure, it’s cold and damp in the street, and so a man has a drop, and it’s no matter.I am not angry.I’ve been drinking myself today, my boy...Come, think and try and remember, did you go to Vahramyev?”"
"“嗯，那么，现在我想起来了，就是这样——我的确去过，哪怕现在就让我……”","“Well, then, now, this is how it was, it’s the truth — I did go, if this very minute ...”"
"“嗯，这很好，彼得鲁什卡，你去了那里，这很好。你看，我并不生气……好了，好了。”我们的主人公继续说，更加耐心地哄他的仆人，还轻拍着他的肩膀，对他微笑着，“好了，你喝了点小酒，你这个混蛋……我想你喝了十戈比，是不是？你真是个狡猾的无赖！唉，没关系。好了，你看我也没生气……我没生气，孩子，我没有生气……”","“Come, that is right, Petrushka, that is quite right that you’ve been.you see I’m not angry...Come, come,” our hero went on, coaxing his servant more and more, patting him on the shoulder and smiling to him, “come, you had a little nip, you scoundrel...You had two-penn’orth of something I suppose?You’re a sly rogue!Well, that’s no matter; come, you see that I’m not angry ... I’m not angry, my boy, I’m not angry...”"
"“不，我不是个狡猾的无赖。随便你怎么说……我只是去看望几个好朋友。我不是无赖，我从来都不是无赖……”","“No, I’m not a sly rogue, say what you like...I only went to see some good friends.I’m not a rogue, and I never have been a rogue...”"
"“哦，不是的，不是的，彼得鲁什卡。听我说，彼得鲁什卡，你知道虽然我叫你无赖，我不是在骂你。我只是说来玩玩，没什么恶意。你明白，彼得鲁什卡，有时候我们叫一个人无赖是在夸奖他，夸他机灵。就是说他是个精明的小伙，不会上别人的圈套。有些人喜欢这么叫……好了，好了，这没什么嘛。好了，告诉我，彼得鲁什卡。不要隐瞒什么了，如实告诉我吧，就像个朋友一样……你去瓦赫拉梅耶夫那儿了没？他给你地址了吗？”","“Oh, no, no, Petrushka; listen, Petrushka, you know I’m not scolding when I called you a rogue.I said that in fun, I said it in a good sense.You see, Petrushka, it is sometimes a compliment to a man when you call him a rogue, a cunning fellow, that he’s a sharp chap and would not let any one take him in.Some men like it ... Come, come, it doesn’t matter!Come, tell me, Petrushka, without keeping anything back, openly, as to a friend ... did you go to Vahramyev’s, and did he give you the address?”"
"“他的确把地址给我了，他把地址给我了。他真是个好人！他说：‘你的主人，你的主人是个大好人。”他说：“是个大好人，替我向他问好，向你的主人。谢谢他，就说我喜欢他。’他还说：‘我十分尊敬你的主人。’‘因为，’他说，‘你的主人，彼得鲁什卡，是个好人。而且，彼得鲁什卡，你也是个好人……’”","“He did give me the address, he did give me the address too.He’s a nice gentleman!‘Your master,’ says he, ‘is a nice man,’ says he, ‘very nice man;’ says he, ‘I send my regards,’ says he, ‘to your master, thank him and say that I like him,’ says he — ‘how I do respect your master,’ says he.‘Because,’ says he, ‘your master, Petrushka,’ says he, ‘is a good man, and you,’ says he, ‘Petrushka, are a good man too ...’”"
"“噢，主呀，我的上帝！但是，地址，说地址的事呀！你真是个犹大！” 戈利亚德金先生说最后一个词时几乎没有发出声音。","“Ah, mercy on us!But the address, the address!You Judas!”The last word Mr. Golyadkin uttered almost in a whisper."
"“地址……地址他给我了。”","“And the address ... he did give the address too.”"
"“他给了？那么，戈利亚德金，戈利亚德金职员，那个小文官，他住在哪儿？”","“He did?Well, where does Golyadkin, the clerk Golyadkin, the titular councillor, live?”"
"“‘嗯，’他说，‘戈利亚德金现在就住在六铺街。你到六铺街，上右侧的楼梯，第四层就是了。你在那儿会找到戈利亚德金的……’”","“‘Why,’ says he, ‘Golyadkin will be now at Shestilavotchny Street.When you get into Shestilavotchny Street take the stairs on the right and it’s on the fourth floor.And there,’ says he, ‘you’ll find Golyadkin...’”"
"“你真是个无赖！”我们的主人公大叫起来，最后终于失去了耐心，“你这个流氓！唉，那是我的地址。唉，你是在说我。我要的是另一个戈利亚德金的地址。我在说另一个戈利亚德金，你这个无赖！”","“You scoundrel!” our hero cried, out of patience at last.“You’re a ruffian!Why, that’s my address; why, you are talking about me.But there’s another Golyadkin; I’m talking about the other one, you scoundrel!”"
"“随便你说，随便你怎么说！跟我有什么关系？你自己随便了……”","“Well, that’s as you please!What is it to me?Have it your own way ...”"
"“那么信，信呢？”","“And the letter, the letter?” ..."
"“什么信？没有什么信呀，我没看到什么信。”","“What letter?There wasn’t any letter, and I didn’t see any letter.”"
"“你把信送到哪里去了，你这个流氓？”","“But what have you done with it, you rascal?”"
"“我把信送到了，送到了。他还说向你问好。他说：‘谢谢你，你家主人是个好人。’他这样说的。‘代我问候他，’他说，‘代我问候你家主人……’”","“I delivered the letter, I delivered it.He sent his regards.‘Thank you,’ says he, ‘your master’s a nice man,’ says he.‘Give my regards,’ says he, ‘to your master...’”"
"“谁说的那些？这是戈利亚德金说的吗？”","“But who said that?Was it Golyadkin said it?”"
"彼得鲁什卡沉默了一会儿，然后，他咧着嘴笑着，直直地看着他主人的脸……","Petrushka said nothing for a moment, and then, with a broad grin, he stared straight into his master’s face..."
"“听着，你这个恶棍！”戈利亚德金先生开始骂道，气得直喘气，“听着，你这个流氓，你到底对我做了些什么？告诉我你到底对我做了什么！你毁了我，你个恶棍，你把我的脑袋砍下啦，你这个犹大！”","“Listen, you scoundrel!” began Mr. Golyadkin, breathless, beside himself with fury; “listen, you rascal, what have you done to me?Tell me what you’ve done to me!You’ve destroyed me, you villain, you’ve cut the head off my shoulders, you Judas!”"
"“随便你怎么骂！我不介意。”彼得鲁什卡坚决地说，回到隔板后面。","“Well, have it your own way!I don’t care,” said Petrushka in a resolute voice, retreating behind the screen."
"“你过来，你给我过来，你这个恶棍……”","“Come here, come here, you ruffian...”"
"“我才不会现在去你跟前，我绝对不会去。我在乎什么，我要去找好心肠的人……那些好人老老实实地生活，不弄虚作假，从没有两面性……”","“I’m not coming to you now, I’m not coming at all.What do I care, I’m going to good folks...Good folks live honestly, good folks live without falsity, and they never have doubles...”"
"戈利亚德金先生手脚冰凉，都快喘不上气来了……","Mr. Golyadkin’s hands and feet went icy cold, his breath failed him..."
"“是的，”彼得鲁什卡继续说，“他们从没有两面性。上帝不折磨诚实的人……”","“Yes,” Petrushka went on, “they never have doubles.God doesn’t afflict honest folk...”"
"“你这个没用的东西，你喝醉了！你这个流氓，你快去睡觉！明天再收拾你。”戈利亚德金先生接着说，声音小得几乎听不见。至于彼得鲁什卡，他又嘟囔了几句。后来就听到他躺在床上，把床压得咯吱咯吱响。打了个长长的呵欠后，他伸了伸懒腰。后来，他就开始打鼾，正如人们说的那样，呼呼大睡。戈利亚德金先生生不如死。彼得鲁什卡的行为，他奇怪的暗示——这些暗示模糊不清，生气也没有用，尤其是被一个喝醉了的人说出时——简言之，这整件事情使局势不容乐观。这一切都将戈利亚德金先生震入了人生低谷。","“You worthless fellow, you are drunk!Go to sleep now, you ruffian!And tomorrow you’ll catch it,” Mr. Golyadkin added in a voice hardly audible.As for Petrushka, he muttered something more; then he could be heard getting into bed, making the bed creak.After a prolonged yawn, he stretched; and at last began snoring, and slept the sleep of the just, as they say.Mr. Golyadkin was more dead than alive.Petrushka’s behaviour, his very strange hints, which were yet so remote that it was useless to be angry at them, especially as they were uttered by a drunken man, and, in short, the sinister turn taken by the affair altogether, all this shook Mr. Golyadkin to the depths of his being."
"“我为什么要深更半夜把他叫醒？”我们的主人公说道，全身颤抖着，感觉浑身无力，“我是受了什么魔鬼的驱使才跟一个醉汉纠缠不清！我能指望一个醉汉说什么？他说的都是谎言。不过，这个流氓在暗示什么？上帝，我的主啊！我为什么要写这封信？我才是自己的敌人，我才是谋杀自己的凶手！我就不能保持缄默吗？我竟然去胡写那些废话！现在好了！你就要走向毁灭了，你就像一块破布，还担心自己的荣誉。你还说什么你的尊严受损，你一定要坚守自己的尊严！我是谋杀自己的凶手，我就是凶手！”","“And what possessed me to go for him in the middle of the night?” said our hero, trembling all over from a sickly sensation.“What the devil made me have anything to do with a drunken man!What could I expect from a drunken man?Whatever he says is a lie.But what was he hinting at, the ruffian?Lord, have mercy on us!And why did I write that letter?I’m my own enemy, I’m my own murderer!As if I couldn’t hold my tongue?I had to go scribbling nonsense!And what now!You are going to ruin, you are like an old rag, and yet you worry about your pride; you say, ‘my honour is wounded,’ you must stick up for your honour!My own murderer, that is what I am!”"
"戈利亚德金先生这么说着，吓得简直不敢动。最后，他的目光落在了一个东西上，这个东西激起了他的高度兴趣。他心生恐惧，怕引起他注意的东西会是幻觉，是他幻想出的假象。他带着希望、畏惧和无法形容的好奇心，向那个东西伸出了双手……不，这不是假象，不是幻觉！这是一封信，真的是一封信，毫无疑问是一封信，而且是写给他的信。戈利亚德金先生从桌上拿起这封信。他的心剧烈地跳动。","Thus spoke Mr. Golyadkin and hardly dared to stir for terror.At last his eyes fastened upon an object which excited his interest to the utmost.In terror lest the object that caught his attention should prove to be an illusion, a deception of his fancy, he stretched out his hand to it with hope, with dread, with indescribable curiosity...No, it was not a deception. Not a delusion!It was a letter, really a letter, undoubtedly a letter, and addressed to him.Mr. Golyadkin took the letter from the table.His heart beat terribly."
"“肯定是那个恶棍带回来的，”他想，“他把信放在这儿了，然后就忘了。一定是这样的，一定就是这样的……”","“No doubt that scoundrel brought it,” he thought, “put it there, and then forgot it; no doubt that is how it happened: no doubt that is just how it happened...”"
"这封信是戈利亚德金先生曾经的朋友，一个年轻的职员瓦赫拉梅耶夫写给他的。“我早就有预感，”我们的主人公想，“我早预感到了信的内容……”","The letter was from Vahramyev, a young fellow-clerk who had once been his friend.“I had a presentiment of this,” thought our hero, “and I had a presentiment of all that there will be in the letter...”"
"信的内容如下：","The letter was as follows —"
"“亲爱的雅科夫·彼得罗维奇先生：","“Dear Sir Yakov Petrovitch!"
"您的仆人醉了，完全失去了理智。因此，我想书面回复你更好。我急于告知你的是，你委托我的那件事情，即把那封信交给你认识的那个人，我一定会仔细严格照办。这个人，也就是你非常熟悉的那个人，他已经取代了我一个朋友的位置。我不想提及这个朋友的名字（因为我不想无端地玷污一个清清白白的人的名声）。现在，他与我们一起暂住在卡罗利娜·伊万诺芙娜的寓所。我们就住在之前我们在一起时，坦波夫来的步兵团官员住的那个房间。不过，此人常和光明磊落、胸怀坦荡的人一起出入，这是一些人望尘莫及的。我打算从今日起与你断绝一切往来。我们已不可能保持朋友关系和朋友般的同志关系。此外，我拜托您，亲爱的先生，收到我这封坦诚的书信后，立即归还你欠我的两卢布。七个月前，我卖给你了一个国外制造的剃须刀，希望你能记起。那时你还和我们一起住在卡罗利娜·伊万诺芙娜家，我打心底里尊敬这位女士。我这么做是因为我从很多有识之士那里听说你已经丧失了尊严和名誉，已经成为危及无辜和清白纯洁的人之道德的一个源头。因为有些人并不坦率，他们说的话全是谎言，他们表现出的好意也令人可疑。经常会有人侮辱卡罗利娜·伊万诺芙娜。可她的行为无可指责，为人诚实。而且，她还是个处女，虽然已不再年轻——但是，从另一方面看，她出身于一个不错的外国家庭。有几个人要求我在这封信里提及这一点，我也是说出我自己的想法。如果你现在还不了解这些，你终会在某个合适的时候了解的。不过，我从一些有识之士那里听说，你现在已经把自己弄得臭名昭著，街头巷尾无人不晓，所以你或许已经听到关于你的传闻了。我亲爱的先生，有个你认识的先生——在此，我为了一些高尚的原因，就不指出他的名字了——他深受那些有头脑的人尊敬。另外，他性格活泼、和蔼可亲，在工作和与普通人群社交方面都同样成功。他从不说谎，对朋友真诚，不会当面称人为朋友，背后却诋毁他们。","“Your servant is drunk, and there is no getting any sense out of him.For that reason I prefer to reply by letter.I hasten to inform you that the commission you’ve entrusted to me — that is, to deliver a letter to a certain person you know, I agree to carry out carefully and exactly.That person, who is very well known to you and who has taken the place of a friend to me, whose name I will refrain from mentioning (because I do not wish unnecessarily to blacken the reputation of a perfectly innocent man), lodges with us at Karolina Ivanovna’s, in the room in which, when you were among us, the infantry officer from Tambov used to be.That person, however, is always to be found in the company of honest and true-hearted persons, which is more than one can say for some people.I intend from this day to break off all connection with you; it’s impossible for us to remain on friendly terms and to keep up the appearance of comradeship congruous with them.And, therefore, I beg you, dear sir, immediately on the receipt of this candid letter from me, to send me the two roubles you owe me for the razor of foreign make which I sold you seven months ago, if you will kindly remember, when you were still living with us in the lodgings of Karolina Ivanovna, a lady whom I respect from the bottom of my heart.I am acting in this way because you, from the accounts I hear from sensible persons, have lost your dignity and reputation and have become a source of danger to the morals of the innocent and uncontaminated.For some persons are not straightforward, their words are full of falsity and their show of good intentions is suspicious.People can always be found capable of insulting Karolina Ivanovna, who is always irreproachable in her conduct, and an honest woman, and, what’s more, a maiden lady, though no longer young — though, on the other hand, of a good foreign family — and this fact I’ve been asked to mention in this letter by several persons, and I speak also for myself.In any case you will learn all in due time, if you haven’t learnt it yet, though you’ve made yourself notorious from one end of the town to the other, according to the accounts I hear from sensible people, and consequently might well have received intelligence relating to you, my dear sir, that a certain person you know, whose name I will not mention here, for certain honourable reasons, is highly respected by right-thinking people, and is, moreover, of lively and agreeable disposition, and is equally successful in the service and in the society of persons of common sense, is true in word and in friendship, and does not insult behind their back those with whom he is on friendly terms to their face."
"","“In any case, I remain "
"涅·瓦赫拉梅耶夫敬上","“In any case, I remain your obedient servant, N. Vahramyev.”"
"","“N.Vahramyev.”"
"又及：你最好把你的仆人解雇了，他是个酒鬼，可能会给你惹不少麻烦。你最好雇佣耶夫斯塔菲，他以前是我的仆人，现在闲着没事。你现在的仆人不仅是个酒鬼，而且更严重的是，他还是个小偷。上周，我就看见他把一磅糖以低于成本价的价格卖给了卡罗利娜·伊万诺芙娜。我想他一定是非常狡猾地偷了您的糖，一次偷一点。我写这些都是为了你好，尽管有些人只会侮辱和欺骗别人，尤其是侮辱和欺骗诚实善良的人。而且，他们背后诽谤这些人，诬陷这些人，仅仅是出于嫉妒，因为他们自己不是诚实善良的人。","“P.S.You had better dismiss your man: he is a drunkard and probably gives you a great deal of trouble; you had better engage Yevstafy, who used to be in service here, and is not out of a place.Your present servant is not only a drunkard, but, what’s more, he’s a thief, for only last week he sold a pound of sugar to Karolina Ivanovna at less than cost price, which, in my opinion, he could not have done otherwise than by robing you in a very sly way, little by little, at different times.I write this to you for your own good, although some people can do nothing but insult and deceive everybody, especially persons of honesty and good nature; what is more, they slander them behind their back and misrepresent them, simply from envy, and because they can’t call themselves the same."
"瓦。”","“V.”"
"读完瓦赫拉梅耶夫的信后，我们的主人公呆坐在沙发上好久，一动也不动。一道新光似乎穿透了这两天一直包围着他的那些模糊不清、无法拨开的雾。我们的主人公似乎有些明白了……他努力从沙发上站起来，在房间里走走，清醒一下头脑，整理他零碎的想法，把它们都集中到一个主题上。然后，他稍微稳定自己的情绪，全面地考虑自己的处境。但是，他还没从沙发上起来就又坐下去了，他虚弱而无助。“是的，当然，我对这一切有预感。但是，他为何这么写，这么写的真正含义是什么呢？假设我真的明白他的意思，那这又怎么样呢？他该直接说出来：我该做这个，做那个，这样我就会照做。事情变成了这样，事情就这样变得一塌糊涂！啊，时间过得快一点，明天快点来就好了！我可以抓紧时间，投入工作！现在我知道我该做什么了。我就如此这般说，同意他的观点，却不出卖自己的尊严，但是……也许就这样。但是我们认识的那个人，那个令人讨厌的家伙，他是怎么卷到这件事情里面来的？他为什么会在这里出现呢？啊，但愿天快点亮！在此之前，他们会诽谤我，设计密谋害我！关键是不能浪费时间。比如，现在我应该写一封信，就如此这般写，说我对这也同意，对那也认同。信要明天一大早，赶在他有所行动之前寄出……将他们一军，比他们先出手，这一群人……他们要用诽谤之词毁灭我，这就是事实！”","After reading Vahramyev’s letter our hero remained for a long time sitting motionless on his sofa.A new light seemed breaking through the obscure and baffling fog which had surrounded him for the last two days.Our hero seemed to reach a partial understanding ... He tried to get up from the sofa to take a turn about the room, to rouse himself, to collect his scattered ideas, to fix them upon a certain subject and then to set himself to rights a little, to think over his position thoroughly.But as soon as he tried to stand up he fell back again at once, weak and helpless.“Yes, of course, I had a presentiment of all that; how he writes though, and what is the real meaning of his words.Supposing I do understand the meaning; but what is it leading to?He should have said straight out: this and that is wanted, and I would have done it.Things have taken such a turn, things have come to such an unpleasant pass!Oh, if only tomorrow would make haste and come, and I could make haste and get to work!I know now what to do.I shall say this and that, I shall agree with his arguments, I won’t sell my honour, but ... maybe; but he, that person we know of, that disagreeable person, how does he come to be mixed up in it?And why has he turned up here?Oh, if tomorrow would make haste and come!They’ll slander me before then, they are intriguing, they are working to spite me!The great thing is not to lose time, and now, for instance, to write a letter, and to say this and that and that I agree to this and that.And as soon as it is daylight tomorrow send it off, before he can do anything ... and so checkmate them, get in before them, the darlings...They will ruin me by their slanders, and that’s the fact of the matter!”"
"戈利亚德金先生拿过纸来，提笔回复秘书的信，内容如下：","Mr. Golyadkin drew the paper to him, took up a pen and wrote the following missive in answer to the secretary’s letter —"
"“亲爱的涅斯托尔·伊格纳季耶维奇先生：","“Dear Sir Nestor Ignatyevitch!"
"我拜读了你写给我的侮辱信，感到既惊奇，又痛彻心扉。因为我清楚地看到，你所谓的某些丢人的家伙和虚伪的朋友就是指我。看到诽谤传播如此之快，并深深扎根，正损害我的前程、尊严和名誉，我真是痛心不已。更让人感到伤心和耻辱的是，那些思想高尚、为人真诚的人们，特别是坦率诚恳的人们，置可敬的人们的利益而不顾，系全身心于罪恶的腐败——这种现象在我们这个艰难而道德沦丧的年代日益显著，以极大的速度蔓延和恶化，令人担忧。最后，我想说，你提醒我的两卢布债务，我将当作是我神圣的义务，悉数奉还。","“With amazement mingled with heartfelt distress I have perused your insulting letter to me, for I see clearly that you are referring to me when you speak of certain discreditable persons and false friends.I see with genuine sorrow how rapidly the calumny has spread and how deeply it has taken root, to the detriment of my prosperity, my honour and my good name.And this is the more distressing and mortifying that even honest people of a genuinely noble way of thinking and, what is even more important, of straightforward and open dispositions, abandon the interests of honourable men and with all the qualities of their hearts attach themselves to the pernicious corruption, which in our difficult and immoral age has unhappily increased and multiplied so greatly and so disloyally.In conclusion, I will say that the debt of two roubles of which you remind me I regard as a sacred duty to return to you in its entirety."
"至于你的暗示——关于某位女士，她的心意、打算和各种谋划——我只能告诉你，先生，我对这些暗示理解得非常模糊，不甚清楚。先生，无论如何，请允许我保持高尚的思考方式，防止我的好名声被玷污。我愿意为可靠起见，屈尊写一份书面解释，而且愿意为双方的利益而接受调解。最后，我请求你，亲爱的先生，向那位女士转达我愿意与她进行私人会面的想法。此外，还请她确定见面的时间和地点。先生，你在信中暗示我侮辱了你，背叛了我们最初的友谊，而且诋毁你，这让我很伤心。我想这个误解是由一些人令人不齿的诽谤、嫉妒和歹意造成的，我公正地把这些人称为与我有不共戴天之仇的敌人。但我想他们不知道，清白之所以强大就是因为它的无辜，某些人无耻、傲慢和令人作呕的放肆行为迟早会遭到众人的蔑视，遗臭万年。这些人走向毁灭，只是因为他们自己的价值缺失和心灵的堕落。最后，我请先生转告这些人，他们妄想把别人排挤出在这个世界上生存的正当之位，取而代之，这种想法是奇怪的、自命不凡的，也是可耻的，得到的会是蔑视、震惊和同情。他们是该进疯人院的。此外，这些行为为法律所禁止，我觉得这个规定完全公正，因为每个人都应满足于自己的位置。每个人都有自己固定的位置，如果这是个玩笑的话，那这个笑话一点都不好笑。进一步说，这是完全违反道德的。我斗胆向你确保，先生，我上面所阐明的关于保持自己位置的观点是完全符合道德的。","“As for your hints concerning a certain person of the female sex, concerning the intentions, calculations and various designs of that person, I can only tell you, sir, that I have but a very dim and obscure understanding of those insinuations.Permit me, sir, to preserve my honourable way of thinking and my good name undefiled, in any case.I am ready to stoop to a written explanation as more secure, and I am, moreover, ready to enter into conciliatory proposals on mutual terms, of course.To that end I beg you, my dear sir, to convey to that person my readiness for a personal arrangement and, what is more, to beg her to fix the time and place of the interview.It grieved me, sir, to read your hints of my having insulted you, having been treacherous to our original friendship and having spoken ill of you.I ascribe this misunderstanding to the abominable calumny, envy and ill-will of those whom I may justly stigmatize as my bitterest foes.But I suppose they do not know that innocence is strong through its very innocence, that the shamelessness, the insolence and the revolting familiarity of some persons, sooner or later gains the stigma of universal contempt; and that such persons come to ruin through nothing but their own worthlessness and the corruption of their own hearts.In conclusion, I beg you, sir, to convey to those persons that their strange pretensions and their dishonourable and fantastic desire to squeeze others out of the position which those others occupy, by their very existence in this world, and to take their place, are deserving of contempt, amazement, compassion and, what is more, the madhouse; moreover, such efforts are severely prohibited by law, which in my opinion is perfectly just, for every one ought to be satisfied with his own position.Every one has his fixed position, and if this is a joke it is a joke in very bad taste.I will say more: it is utterly immoral, for, I make bold to assure you, sir, my own views which I have expounded above, in regard to keeping one’s own place, are purely moral."

"第十章","CHAPTER 10"
"总之，我们可以这么说，前一天的冒险已经使戈利亚德金先生彻底失去了勇气。我们的主人公度过了一个难挨的晚上。也就是说，他完全睡着的时间几乎不到五分钟，就像有个淘气包把鬃毛撒在了他床上似的。他整夜都处于一种半睡半醒的状态，辗转反侧，从左翻到右，从右又翻到左，呻吟抱怨，偶尔打一会儿盹儿，片刻后又醒来。他自始至终都感受到一种奇怪的痛苦、模糊的记忆和骇人的幻觉——事实上，所有不愉快的事情都涌上心头。","Altogether, we may say, the adventures of the previous day had thoroughly unnerved Mr. Golyadkin.Our hero passed a very bad night; that is, he did not get thoroughly off to sleep for five minutes: as though some practical joker had scattered bristles in his bed.He spent the whole night in a sort of half-sleeping state, tossing from side to side, from right to left, moaning and groaning, dozing off for a moment, waking up again a minute later, and all was accompanied by a strange misery, vague memories, hideous visions — in fact, everything disagreeable that can be imagined..."
"有一段时间，他的眼前出现了安德雷·菲利波维奇的身影，笼罩在奇特神秘的昏暗光线下。那是一个冷淡而愠怒的身影，眼神冰冷严厉，说着几乎没有礼貌可言的责备之词……正当戈利亚德金先生要走到安德雷·菲利波维奇跟前去为自己作些辩解，要向他证明自己不是对手所中伤的那样，而是这样或那样的人，甚至还拥有与生俱来的天性美德，比普通人更高尚。就在这时，有个因不体面的行为而臭名昭著的家伙出现在这个场景中。他使用令人极其厌恶的手段立刻破坏了可怜的戈利亚德金先生的努力。此刻，他几乎当着戈利亚德金先生的面，使其名誉扫地，在污泥中践踏其尊严，然后立即占据他的官职及社会地位。","At one moment the figure of Andrey Filippovitch appeared before him in a strange, mysterious half-light.It was a frigid, wrathful figure, with a cold, harsh eye and with stiffly polite word of blame on its lips... and as soon as Mr. Golyadkin began going up to Andrey Filippovitch to defend himself in some way and to prove to him that he was not at all such as his enemies represented him, that he was like this and like that, that he even possessed innate virtues of his own, superior to the average—at once a person only too well known for his discreditable behaviour appeared on the scene, and by some most revolting means instantly frustrated poor Mr. Golyadkin’s efforts, on the spot, almost before the latter’s eyes, blackened his reputation, trampled his dignity in the mud, and then immediately took possession of his place in the service and in society."
"又有一段时间，戈利亚德金先生觉得脑袋有些疼，就像被人轻敲了一下似的。这下击打是不久前发生在日常生活中或在某种工作表现中的，他老实地接受了。要反抗这种击打是很难的……正当戈利亚德金先生绞尽脑汁苦苦思索为什么他连这个击打都很难发出抗议时，这种击打的想法渐渐地转换成一种不同的形式——成了他见过、听过，甚至亲身实践过的某种为人所熟悉、微不足道，或相当重要的龌龊行为——他的确常常这么做，原因并不无耻下流，甚至动机也不无耻下流，但事情就那样发生了——比如，他有时是出于得体，有时是因为完全没有能力自我防卫——事实上，原因是……戈利亚德金先生对原因清清楚楚。想到这里，即便在睡梦中，戈利亚德金先生也面红耳赤。他抚平自己的羞愧，嘟嘟囔囔地对自己说，在这种情况下，他应该表现出自己性格的力量来，应该在这种情况下表现出他性格中可叹的力量来。可是一会儿，他又自问：“究竟什么是性格的力量呢？为什么要现在弄明白呢？”他就以这个问题结束了自己的思索。","At another time Mr. Golyadkin’s head felt sore from some sort of slight blow of late conferred and humbly accepted, received either in the course of daily life or somehow in the performance of his duty, against which blow it was difficult to protest...And while Mr. Golyadkin was racking his brains over the question of why it was difficult to protest even against such a blow, this idea of a blow gradually melted away into a different form—into the form of some familiar, trifling, or rather important piece of nastiness which he had seen, heard, or even himself committed—and frequently committed, indeed, and not on nasty ground, not from any nasty impulse, even, but just because it happened—sometimes, for instance, out of delicacy, another time owing to his absolute defencelessness—in fact, because...because, in fact, Mr. Golyadkin knew perfectly well because of what!At this point Mr. Golyadkin blushed in his sleep, and, smothering his blushes, muttered to himself that in this case he ought to be able to show the strength of his character, he ought to be able to show in this case the remarkable strength of his character, and then wound up by asking himself, “What, after all, is strength of character? Why understand it now?”…Why understand it now?” ..."
"然而，令戈利亚德金先生最为恼火的是，偏偏在这个时候，总是有位因其有失尊严的滑稽行为而广为人知的人不请自来。他不管事情显然已经解决这个事实，总会带着一丝不合礼仪的微笑，嘀咕着说：“性格的力量有什么作用！雅科夫·彼得罗维奇，咱俩怎样才能有性格的力量呢？”","But what irritated and enraged Mr. Golyadkin most of all was that invariably, at such a moment, a person well known for his undignified burlesque turned up uninvited, and, regardless of the fact that the matter was apparently settled, he, too, would begin muttering, with an unseemly little smile “What’s the use of strength of character!How could you and I, Yakov Petrovitch, have strength of character?…”...”"
"过了一会儿，戈利亚德金先生又梦见自己在一群智慧超群且教养良好的人中间。戈利亚德金先生也以其智慧和礼貌而引人注目。大家都喜欢他，甚至一些在场的他的敌人也开始喜欢他，这使得戈利亚德金先生十分开心。每个人都尊他为首，最后连戈利亚德金先生自己都开心地偷听到主人把一位客人拉到一边，对他赞扬自己……突然，又有一个人毫无缘由地出现了，是小戈利亚德金先生。他因背信弃义和凶残粗暴而臭名昭著。小戈利亚德金先生一在这里出现，就毁坏了老戈利亚德金先生所有的胜利和荣耀，使其相形见绌，在污泥中践踏他。最后他还证明老戈利亚德金——即真正的戈利亚德金——显然根本就是个冒牌货，而他，小戈利亚德金才是真正的戈利亚德金；而且，事实上，老戈利亚德金先生不是他表面看起来的样子，他十分可耻，所以无权混在教养良好、值得尊敬的上流社会人群中。这一切进行得极其迅速，戈利亚德金先生还没有时间张嘴为自己辩护，大家已从身体到精神被这个可恶的假戈利亚德金先生征服了，完全蔑视、拒绝无辜的真戈利亚德金先生。声名狼藉的戈利亚德金先生把大家的看法都改变了。虚伪、卑微的戈利亚德金先生以他最温和的方式集结起所有人，甚至包括人群中最不起眼的人。他用自己的方式讨好他们，点燃芳香扑鼻的香。这样，受到奉承的那些人仅仅闻到这股香味，就连打喷嚏，甚至掉下眼泪来，感到极度快乐。而且最糟糕的是，这一切都是在瞬间完成的：这个虚伪、卑微的戈利亚德金先生动作之迅速真是绝妙！比如说，他真诚地花费时间去谄媚一个人，博得他的好感。而这个人还没来得及眨眼，他已经到第二个人那里去谄媚了。他悄悄地奉承着下一个人，脸上挂着善意的笑容，木头一般、又短又圆的腿快速移动着。转眼间，他就到了第三个人跟前去谄媚奉承。他友善地讨好着这个人，那人还没来得及开口，或感到惊讶，他已经到了第四个人跟前。他对这个人施以同样的巧计——太可怕了，根本就是巫术！可是，人人都喜欢他，人人都爱他，奉承他。所有人众口一词地宣称他的礼貌得体和辛辣智慧远远胜过真戈利亚德金先生，并且嘲笑和排斥真实单纯的后者。他们把忠诚的戈利亚德金先生从人群中推搡着赶出，他以博爱知名，现在却遭受雨点般的捶打！……","Then Mr. Golyadkin would dream that he was in the company of a number of persons distinguished for their wit and good breeding; that he, Mr. Golyadkin, too, was conspicuous for his wit and politeness, that everybody like him, which was very agreeable to Mr. Golyadkin, even some of his enemies who were present began to like him, which was very agreeable to Mr. Golyadkin; that every one gave him precedence, and that at last Mr. Golyadkin himself, with gratification, overheard the host, drawing one of the guests aside, speak in his, Mr. Golyadkin’s praise ... and all of a sudden, apropos of nothing, there appeared again a person, notorious for his treachery and brutal impulses, in the form of Mr. Golyadkin junior, and on the spot, at once, by his very appearance on the scene, Mr. Golyadkin junior destroyed the whole triumph and glory of Mr. Golyadkin senior, eclipsed Mr. Golyadkin senior, trampled him in the mud, and, at last, proved clearly that Golyadkin senior—that is, the genuine one—was not the genuine one at all but the sham, and that he, Golyadkin junior, was the real one; that, in fact, Mr. Golyadkin senior was not a t all what he appeared to be, but something very disgraceful, and that consequently he had no right to mix in the society of honourable and well-bred people. And all this was done so quickly that Mr. Golyadkin had not time to open his mouth before all of them were subjugated, body and soul, by the wicked, sham Mr. Golyadkin, and with profound contempt rejected him, the real and innocent Mr. Golyadkin.There was not one person left whose opinion the infamous Mr. Golyadkin would not have changed round.There was not left one person, even the most insignificant of the company, to whom the false and worthless Mr. Golyadkin would not make up in his blandest manner, upon whom he would not fawn in his own way, before whom he would not burn sweet and agreeable incense, so that the flattered person simply sniffed and sneezed till the tears came, in token of the intensest pleasure.And the worst of it was that all this was done in a flash: the swiftness of movement of the false and worthless Mr. Golyadkin was marvellous!he sincerely had time, for instance, to make up to one person and win his good graces — and before one could wink an eye he was at another.He stealthily fawns on another, drops a smile of benevolence, twirls on his short, round, though rather wooden-looking leg, and already he’s at a third, and is cringing upon a third, he’s making up to him in a friendly way; before one has time to open one’s mouth, before one has time to feel surprised he’s at a fourth, at the same manoeuvres with him — it was horrible: sorcery and nothing else!And every one was pleased with him and everybody liked him, and every one was exalting him, and all were proclaiming in chorus that his politeness and sarcastic wit were infinitely superior to the politeness and sarcastic wit of the real Mr. Golyadkin and putting the real and innocent Mr. Golyadkin to shame thereby and rejecting the veritable Mr. Golyadkin, and shoving and pushing out the loyal Mr. Golyadkin, and showering blows on the man so well known for his love towards his fellow creatures!..."
"遭受残酷对待的戈利亚德金先生痛苦、恐惧、盛怒着跑到了街上，开始试图租一辆马车直奔司长家去，或者，即使不去司长家，也至少要去安德雷·菲利波维奇那里一趟，但是——可怕！马车夫断然拒绝载戈利亚德金先生，说：“我们不能拉两位完全相同的人，先生。大人，好人应该尽量老老实实的，不要变成两个人。”马车夫语气坚决地拒绝拉载戈利亚德金，他说：“先生，我们拒绝拉两个完全相同的人，一个老实人力求老实本分，不能任意胡来，而您怎么会一个变两个？”老实本分的戈利亚德金先生感到羞耻，他环顾四周，的的确确亲眼看到与人群串通一气的马车夫和彼得鲁什卡都没错。因为那个道德沦丧的戈利亚德金先生确实就在这里，在他身旁触手可及的地方。而且，按照他特有的卑鄙可耻习性，在这个关键时刻，他肯定准备做出什么不成体统的事情来，与经过良好教育培养而形成的绅士品质很不相称——可憎的戈利亚德金先生第二一遇到机会，就吹嘘这种绅士品德。刚直不阿却被完全摧毁的戈利亚德金先生在羞耻与绝望中拔腿就往前跑，听从命运的牵引。但是，每跑一步，他的脚每踩踏一次路上的花岗岩，就好像有一个完全相同的戈利亚德金先生从地下跳出来，和他完全相同，内心却令人憎恶、堕落腐败。所有这些酷似戈利亚德金先生的人一出现，就一个接一个地跑着，像一群鹅一样连成一列长队，蹒跚着跟在真戈利亚德金先生身后。这些复制品无处不在。戈利亚德金先生无论从哪一方面看都应得到同情，吓得喘不过气。最后，戈利亚德金先生的复制品挤满了整个城市。警察看到这种不成体统的场景，不得不抓住所有这些复制品的衣领，把他们放进碰巧在他附近的班房。我们的主人公醒了，吓得麻木发抖。麻木和发抖使他觉得醒来也几乎于事无补。他感到压抑、悲痛。他感到压抑、悲痛。他痛苦无比，感到像是有人在撕咬他的心。最后，戈利亚德金先生再也受不了了。他坚定地坐在床上，大叫道：“不能这样！” 惊叫之后，他完全清醒了。","In misery, in terror and in fury, the cruelly treated Mr. Golyadkin ran out into the street and began trying to take a cab in order to drive straight to his Excellency’s, or, at any rate, to Andrey Filippovitch, but — horror! the cabman absolutely refused to take Mr.Golyadkin, saying, “We cannot drive two gentlemen exactly alike, sir; a good man tries to like honestly, your honour, and never has a double.”the cabman absolutely refused to take Mr. Golyadkin, saying, “We cannot drive two gentlemen exactly alike, sir; a good man tries to like honestly, your honour, and never has a double.”Overcome with shame, the unimpeachable, honest Mr. Golyadkin looked round and did, in fact, assure himself with his own eyes that the cabman and Petrushka, who had joined them, were all quite right, for the depraved Mr. Golyadkin was actually on the spot, beside him, close at hand, and with his characteristic nastiness was again, at this critical moment, certainly preparing to do something very unseemly, and quite out of keeping with that gentlemanliness of character which is usually acquired by good breeding — that gentlemanliness of which the loathsome Mr. Golyadkin the second was always boasting on every opportunity.Beside himself with shame and despair, the utterly ruined though perfectly just Mr. Golyadkin dashed headlong away, wherever fate might lead him; but with every step he took, with every thud of his foot on the granite of the pavement, there leapt up as though out of the earth a Mr. Golyadkin precisely the same, perfectly alike, and of a revolting depravity of heart.And all these precisely similar Golyadkins set to running after one another as soon as they appeared, and stretched in a long chain like a file of geese, hobbling after the real Mr. Golyadkin, so there was nowhere to escape from these duplicates—so that Mr. Golyadkin, who was in every way deserving of compassion, was breathless with terror; so that at last a terrible multitude of duplicates had sprung into being; so that the whole town was obstructed at last by duplicate Golyadkins, and the police officer, seeing such a breach of decorum, was obliged to seize all these duplicates by the collar and to put them into the watch-house, which happened to be beside him... Numb and chill with horror, our hero woke up, and numb and chill with horror felt that his waking state was hardly more cheerful...It was oppressive and harrowing...He was overcome by such anguish that it seemed as though some one were gnawing at his heart.At last Mr. Golyadkin could endure it no longer.“This shall not be!” he cried, resolutely sitting up in bed, and after this exclamation he felt fully awake."
"看起来好像天早已亮了。房间里明亮无比。阳光透过结了冰的窗格照进来，洒满了房间。这使戈利亚德金先生大吃一惊，因为至少在他的记忆里，很少有这种例外情形，即发光天体在运转中把屋子照得这么亮。我们的主人公几乎没有时间对此事好奇，就听到隔板后有一阵钟声嗡嗡地响起，似乎是刚刚敲响。“啊。”戈利亚德金先生想着，痛苦焦虑地准备听下去……","It seemed as though it were rather late in the day.It was unusually light in the room.The sunshine filtered through the frozen panes and flooded the room with light, which surprised Mr. Golyadkin not a little and, so far as Mr. Golyadkin could remember, at least, there had scarcely ever been such exceptions in the course of the heavenly luminary before.Our hero had hardly time to wonder at this when he heard the clock buzzing behind the partition as though it was just on the point of striking.“Now,” thought Mr. Golyadkin, and he prepared to listen with painful suspense..."
"但是，使戈利亚德金先生惊诧不已的是，钟嗡嗡着，只响了一下。","But to complete Mr. Golyadkin’s astonishment, clock whirred and only struck once."
"“这是什么意思？”我们的主人公大叫道，最后从床上跳了下来。他不能相信自己的耳朵，于是像之前那样飞快跑到隔板后看个究竟。的确是一点钟。戈利亚德金先生瞥了一眼彼得鲁什卡的床，而屋里完全没有他的踪影。他的床早已收拾整齐，人也离开了。地上哪儿都没有他的靴子——这是彼得鲁什卡不在屋里的一个确切标志。戈利亚德金先生急忙冲向房门，房门是锁着的。“他在哪儿？彼得鲁卡夫在哪儿？”他继续小声说，感到非常激动，全身颤动起来……突然，他想到了一件事。戈利亚德金先生急忙跑到桌子跟前，扫视了一遍桌子，摸了个遍——是的，这是真的，他昨晚写给瓦赫拉梅耶夫的信不在桌子上了。彼得鲁什卡也不在隔板后，钟刚刚只敲了一下，瓦赫拉梅耶夫在信中向他提到了一些新的信息。这些信息初看很晦涩，现在完全清楚了。很显然，彼得鲁什卡最终还是被收买了！“是的，是的，就是这样的！”","“What does this mean?” cried our hero, finally leaping out of bed.And, unable to believe his ears, he rushed behind the screen just as he was.It actually was one o’clock.Mr. Golyadkin glanced at Petrushka’s bed; but the room did not even smell of Petrushka: his bed had long been made and left, his boots were nowhere to be seen either — an unmistakable sign that Petrushka was not in the house.Mr. Golyadkin rushed to the door: the door was locked.“But where is he, where is Petrushka?” he went on in a whisper, conscious of intense excitement and feeling a perceptible tremor run all over him ... Suddenly a thought floated into his mind ... Mr. Golyadkin rushed to the table, looked all over it, felt all round — yes, it was true, his letter of the night before to Vahramyev was not there.Petrushka was nowhere behind the screen either, the clock had just struck one, and some new points were evident to him in Vahramyev’s letter, points that were obscure at first sight though now they were fully explained.Petrushka had evidently been bribed at last!“Yes, yes, that was so!”"
"“大密谋就是这样出炉的！”戈利亚德金先生大叫着，捶打着自己的前额，眼睛越睁越大，“原来整个邪恶势力都藏在这个可恶的德国女人家里！可见，她声东击西，把我引到伊兹梅洛夫桥去——她在转移我的视线，迷惑我（这无耻的巫婆）。这样，她就可以布自己的雷，算计我！是的，就是这样！如果只从这方面来看，那就应该是这样的。这个混账出现在场景中的缘由也完全清楚了：这就是阴谋的一部分。他们早就把他抓在手上了，就为这邪恶的一天做准备。这就是事情的原委！事情就是这样发展的。不过，没关系。迄今为止，一切并未大势已去。”","“So this was how the chief plot was hatched!” cried Mr. Golyadkin, slapping himself on the forehead, opening his eyes wider and wider; “so in that filthy German woman’s den the whole power of evil lies hidden now!So she was only making a strategic diversion in directing me to the Ismailovsky Bridge — she was putting me off the scent, confusing me (the worthless witch), and in that way laying her mines!Yes, that is so!If one only looks at the thing from that point of view, all of this is bound to be so, and the scoundrel’s appearance on the scene is fully explained: it’s all part and parcel of the same thing.They’ve kept him in reserve a long while, they had him in readiness for the evil day.This is how it has all turned out!This is what it has come to.But there, never mind.No time has been lost so far.”"
"就在此时，戈利亚德金先生惊恐地想起了现在是午后一点钟。“如果他们已经得逞了，该怎么办？”他发出一阵呻吟……“不会的，他们在撒谎，他们还没来得及下手——我们等着瞧……”","At this point Mr. Golyadkin recollected with horror that it was past one in the afternoon.“What if they have succeeded by now?…” He uttered a moan…...” He uttered a moan...“But, no, they are lying, they’ve not had time —we shall see...”"
"他匆匆穿上衣服，抓起笔和纸，胡乱写了下面的信：","He dressed after a fashion, seized paper and a pen, and scribbled the following missive —"
"“亲爱的雅科夫·彼得洛维奇先生：","“Dear Sir Yakov Petrovitch!"
"既生瑜，何生亮？你我势不两立，不可共存。因此，我必须要告诉您，您那奇怪、可笑，同时又不可能实现的愿望，即冒充我的孪生兄弟招摇过市，是绝不会有任何结果的，只会使您名誉扫地，狼狈不堪。所以，我请求您，为了您自己好，请退后，为真正怀有崇高目标的可敬人士让路。不然的话，我会准备采取极端措施。我就此搁笔，等待回复……然而，我已准备好为您效劳或与您刀枪相见。","“Either you or I, but both together is out of the question!And so I must inform you that your strange, absurd, and at the same time impossible desire to appear to be my twin and to give yourself out as such serves no other purpose than to bring about your complete disgrace and discomfiture.And so I beg you, for the sake of your own advantage, to step aside and make way for really honourable men of loyal aims.In the opposite case I am ready to determine upon extreme measures.I lay down my pen and await ... However, I remain ready to oblige or to meet you with pistols."
"雅·戈利亚德金。”","“Y. Golyadkin.”Golyadkin.”"
"我们的主人公写完了这封信，用力地搓了搓手。然后，他穿上大衣，戴上帽子，用备用钥匙打开公寓大门的锁，朝单位里去了。他到了办公室，却没法下定决心走进去——现在已太晚了。戈利亚德金先生的表显示，时间已经是两点半了。突然，一个看似不太重要的情况解开了戈利亚德金先生心里的一些疑惑：一个满脸通红、气喘吁吁的身影突然从单位大楼的屏风后出现，像老鼠一样蹑手蹑脚地窜上台阶，进了入口。他是复印员奥斯塔菲耶夫，戈利亚德金先生和他很熟。他是个很有用的人，愿意为一点小利做任何事。我们的主人公了解奥斯塔菲耶夫的弱点，猜测他不可避免地离开片刻后，对小费一定会比往常更贪婪。于是，他下定决心，不惜破费，立即窜到台阶上，跟着奥斯塔菲耶夫进了入口，叫住他，神秘地把他带到一个大铁炉后一处方便的角落。把他领到那儿之后，我们的主人公开始质问他。","Our hero rubbed his hands energetically when he had finished the letter.Then, pulling on his greatcoat and putting on his hat, he unlocked his flat with a spare key and set off for the department.He reached the office but could not make up his mind to go in — it was by now too late.It was half-past two by Mr. Golyadkin’s watch.All at once a circumstance of apparently little importance settled some doubts in Mr. Golyadkin’s mind: a flushed and breathless figure suddenly made its appearance from behind the screen of the department building and with a stealthy movement like a rat he darted up the steps and into the entry.It was a copying clerk called Ostafyev, a man Mr. Golyadkin knew very well, who was rather useful and ready to do anything for a trifle.Knowing Ostafyev’s weak spot and surmising that after his brief, unavoidable absence he would probably be greedier than ever for tips, our hero made up his mind not to be sparing of them, and immediately darted up the steps, and then into the entry after him, called to him and, with a mysterious are, drew him aside into a convenient corner, behind a huge iron stove.And having led him there, our hero began questioning him."
"“嗨，伙计，那边怎么样？……你明白我的意思吧？”","“Well, my dear fellow, how are things going in there ... you understand me?…”...”"
"“是，大人，我祝福您健康，大人。”","“Yes, your honour, I wish you good health, your honour.”"
"“好了，我的朋友，好了。但是，我会奖励你的，我的好伙计。嗯，你看，到底怎么样？”","“All right, my good man, all right; but I’ll reward you, my good fellow.Well, you see, how are things?”"
"“大人，您在问什么？”这时，奥斯塔菲耶夫的嘴要张开了，幸好他及时捂住了，动作完成得很自然。","“What is your honour asking?”At this point Ostafyev held his hand as though by accident before his open mouth."
"“你知道的，亲爱的朋友，是这样的……但是你不认为……算了，安德雷·菲利波维奇在这儿吗？”","“You see, my dear fellow, this is how it is ... but don’t you imagine ... Come, is Andrey Filippovitch here?...”"
"“是的，他在这儿。”","“Yes, he is here.”"
"“其他职员在这儿吗？”","“And are the clerks here?”"
"“是的，先生，他们都在，就像往常一样。”","“Yes, sir, they are here as usual.”"
"“司长也在吗？”","“And his Excellency too?”"
"“司长也在。”此时，这个人又一次把手捂在嘴上，非常好奇地看着戈利亚德金先生。至少，我们的主人公是这么认为的。","“And his Excellency too.”Here the man held his hand before his mouth again, and looked rather curiously and strangely at Mr. Golyadkin, so at least our hero fancied."
"“没发生什么特别的事吗，我的朋友？”","“And there’s nothing special there, my good man?”"
"“没有，先生。当然没有，先生。”","“No, sir, certainly not, sir.”"
"“所以，没有什么有关我的事情，我的朋友。没有发生什么事情吗？也就是说，没有什么别的……嗯？没有别的什么事吗，你明白的，我的朋友？”","“So there’s nothing concerning me, my friend.Is there nothing going on there — that is, nothing more than ... eh? nothing more, you understand, my friend?”"
"“没有，先生。到目前为止，我没听到发生什么事情。”这个人又一次用手捂着嘴，用奇怪的眼神看着戈利亚德金先生。事实上，戈利亚德金先生正试图读懂奥斯塔菲耶夫的神情，企图发现有没有什么隐藏在里面。事实上，他看起来的确像是隐瞒了些什么：奥斯塔菲耶夫似乎变得更冷漠和无礼了，而且也不像交谈开始时那样对戈利亚德金先生那么关切了。“在某种程度上，他有理由这样。”戈利亚德金先生想，“毕竟，我对于他而言算什么呢？也许他已经收到了另一方的好处，才溜出来的。但是，我要试试他……”戈利亚德金先生意识到现在是金钱发挥作用的时候了。","“No, sir, I’ve heard nothing so far, sir.”Again the man put his hand before his mouth and again looked rather strangely at Mr. Golyadkin.The fact was, Mr. Golyadkin was trying to read Ostafyev’s countenance, trying to discover whether there was not something hidden in it.And, in fact, he did look as though he were hiding something: Ostafyev seemed to grow colder and more churlish, and did not enter into Mr. Golyadkin’s interests with the same sympathy as at the beginning of the conversation.“He is to some extent justified,” thought Mr. Golyadkin.“After all, what am I to him?Perhaps he has already been bribed by the other side, and that’s why he has just been absent. but, here, I’ll try him…” Mr. Golyadkin realized that the moment for kopecks had arrived.but, here, I’ll try him ...” Mr. Golyadkin realized that the moment for kopecks had arrived."
"“给你，我亲爱的朋友……”","“Here, my dear fellow ...”"
"“我衷心地谢谢大人的赏赐。”","“I’m feelingly grateful for your honour’s kindness.”"
"“我还会给你更多的。”","“I’ll give you more than that.”"
"“是，大人。”","“Yes, your honour.”"
"“我马上会给你更多。等事成之后，我还会给你这么多。你明白吗？”","“I’ll give you some more directly, and when the business is over I’ll give you as much again.Do you understand?”"
"这个职员没有说话。他作立正姿势，一动不动地望着戈利亚德金先生。","The clerk did not speak.He stood at attention and stared fixedly at Mr. Golyadkin."
"“好啦，现在告诉我，你没有听说任何关于我的消息吗？”","“Come, tell me now: have you heard nothing about me?…”...”"
"“我想，到现在为止，我还没有听说什么……就是说……到目前没听到什么。”奥斯塔菲耶夫也像戈利亚德金先生那样说话时慎重用词，保持一种神秘的神态。他微微扬起眉毛，眼睛看着地面，试图拿捏好合适的腔调。事实上，他竭尽全力想把许诺给他的钱挣到手，因为他觉得自己已经得到的钱就是自己挣的钱。","“I think, so far, I have not ... so to say ... nothing so far.”Ostafyev, like Mr. Golyadkin, spoke deliberately and preserved a mysterious air, moving his eyebrows a little, looking at the ground, trying to fall into the suitable tone, and, in fact, doing his very utmost to earn what had been promised him, for what he had received already he reckoned as already earned."
"“你什么也不知道？”","“And you know nothing?”"
"“迄今为止，一无所知，先生。”","“So far, nothing, sir.”"
"“我说……那个……也许你会知道些……”","“Listen ... you know ... maybe you will know ...”"
"“之后，当然了，我也许能得到些消息。”","“Later on, of course, maybe I shall know.”"
"“前景不妙。”我们的主人公想。“我说，我再给你点钱，亲爱的伙计。”","“It’s a poor look out,” thought our hero.“Listen: here’s something more, my dear fellow.”"
"“我由衷地感谢大人。”","“I am truly grateful to your honour.”"
"“瓦赫拉梅耶夫昨天来这儿了吗？”","“Was Vahramyev here yesterday?…”...”"
"“来过，先生。”","“Yes, sir.”"
"“那……别人呢？他呢？你再试着想想，老弟。”","“And ... somebody else?… Was he?…Try and remember, brother.”... Was he?... Try and remember, brother.”"
"这人从记忆里仔细搜索了一会儿，想不出什么有用的信息。","The man ransacked his memory for a moment, and could think of nothing appropriate."
"“没有，先生，没有别的任何人来过。”","“No, sir, there wasn’t anybody else.”"
"“嗯！”接着便是沉默。","“H’m!” a silence followed."
"“我说老弟呀，再给你点钱，全部都告诉我吧，每个细节。”","“Listen, brother, here’s some more; tell me all, every detail.”"
"“是的，先生。”奥斯塔菲耶夫现在已经变得像丝绸般柔顺了。这正是戈利亚德金先生想要的。","“Yes, sir,” Ostafyev had by now become as soft as silk; which was just what Mr. Golyadkin needed."
"“我的好老弟呀，赶紧告诉我，他现在混得如何啊？”","“Explain to me now, my good man, what footing is he on?”"
"“还好，先生。他混得不错，先生。”这人回答说，睁大眼睛看着戈利亚德金先生。","“All right, sir, a good one, sir,” answered the man, gazing open-eyed at Mr. Golyadkin."
"“你说‘还好’是什么意思？”","“How do you mean, all right?”"
"“嗯，也就是那样，先生。”这时，奥斯塔菲耶夫别有用意地扬了扬眉毛。不过，他完全走进了死胡同，不知道再说什么。","“Well, it’s just like that, sir.”Here Ostafyev twitched his eyebrows significantly.But he was utterly nonplussed and didn’t know what more to say."
"“前景不妙。”戈利亚德金先生心想。","“It’s a poor look out,” thought Mr. Golyadkin."
"“没再发生点什么……什么……关于瓦赫拉梅耶夫的事？”","“And hasn’t anything more happened ... in there ... about Vahramyev?”"
"“一切都跟往常一样。”","“But everything is just as usual.”"
"“你再想想。”","“Think a little.”"
"“有，他们说……”","“There is, they say ...”"
"“说吧，怎么了？”","“Come, what?”"
"奥斯塔菲耶夫用手捂住了嘴。","Ostafyev put his hand in front of his mouth."
"“这里……没有给我的……信吗？”","“Wasn’t there a letter ... from here ... to me?”"
"“那个叫米赫耶夫的侍者去了瓦赫拉梅耶夫的宅邸找他们的德国女房东。所以，如果你想的话，我可以去打听打听。”","“Mihyeev the attendant went to Vahramyev’s lodging, to their German landlady, so I’ll go and ask him if you like.”"
"“那就拜托老弟了，行行好……我只是说……老弟呀，你可不要多想，我的意思仅仅是……老弟呀，你帮忙打听一下，看看他们有没有什么针对我的计划。搞清楚他在干什么。这就是我想要的，也是你要去打听的，我亲爱的伙计。我以后会好好酬谢你的，好人呀……”","“Do me the favour, brother, for goodness’ sake!“Do me the favour, brother, for goodness’ sake! ... I only mean ... you mustn’t imagine anything, brother, I only mean ... Yes, you question him, brother, find out whether they are not getting up something concerning me.Find out how he is acting.That is what I want; that is what you must find out, my dear fellow, and then I’ll reward you, my good man...”"
"“我会去问的，大人。今天，伊万·谢苗诺维奇坐在了您的位置上。”","“I will, your honour, and Ivan Semyonovitch sat in your place today, sir.”"
"“伊万·谢苗诺维奇？啊，对了，你没提这些。”","“Ivan Semyonovitch?Oh! really, you don’t say so.”"
"“安德雷·菲利波维奇让他坐在那儿的。”","“Andrey Filippovitch told him to sit there.”"
"“真……的……吗？为什么呢？你一定要打听清楚，老弟。看在上帝的份上，老兄，把一切都打听清楚。我会酬谢你的，亲爱的伙计。我想知道真相……你不要胡思乱想，老弟……”","“Re-al-ly!How did that happen?You must find out, brother; for God’s sake find out, brother; find it all out — and I’ll reward you, my dear fellow; that’s what I want to know ... and don’t you imagine anything, brother...”"
"“就这样，先生，就这样。我马上就去办。先生，您今天不进去了吗？”","“Just so, sir, just so; I’ll go at once.And aren’t you going in today, sir?”"
"“不了，我的朋友。我不过到处转转，只是到处转转，你知道。我来只是到处转转，我的朋友。日后我一定会酬谢你的，我的朋友。”","“No, my friend; I only looked round, I only looked round, you know.I only came to have a look round, my friend, and I’ll reward you afterwards, my friend.”"
"“好的，先生。”这人快速而急切地跑上台阶，把戈利亚德金先生独自一人留在那里。","“Yes, sir.”The man ran rapidly and eagerly up the stairs and Mr. Golyadkin was left alone."
"“前景不妙呀！”戈利亚德金先生想。“唉，事情不妙，不妙！哎呀，我们的事情不太妙呀！这一切究竟是什么意思呢？比如说，那个醉鬼的谄媚奉承是什么意思呢？又是谁想出的鬼把戏呢？啊！我知道是谁了。原来是这样。他们一定是发现了，还让他坐到那里……但是，难道是他们把他安排到那儿的？安德雷·菲利波维奇让他坐在那儿，有何意图呢？很可能他们已经知道了……这是瓦赫拉梅耶夫在捣鬼——我是说，不是他在捣鬼，他笨得像根白蜡树柱子。瓦赫拉梅耶夫就是这样的笨蛋，他们在他背后为他谋划，怂恿这个混蛋也是这个目的。那个独眼的德国娘们把悲痛一一道出。我一直怀疑这个阴谋绝非没有目的，这个老女人式的造谣诽谤中一定有什么猫腻。我还把这些想法告诉过克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇，告诉他他们发誓要杀人——当然是在道德层面上——他们对卡罗利娜·伊万诺芙娜发动了突然袭击。是的，显然，有老手在其中操纵。是的，先生，有老手在其中操纵，不是瓦赫拉梅耶夫所为。我已经说过，瓦赫拉梅耶夫是个笨蛋，但是……我知道谁是幕后主使，是那个流氓，那个冒名顶替者。他也只有这种事可依靠，他在上流社会的成功多少能证明这一点。我当然很想知道他现在混得怎样。他在他们中算什么？只是，他们为什么要用伊万·谢苗诺维奇呢？他们想用伊万·谢苗诺维奇干些什么勾当呢？难道他们就再找不到别的人了吗？不过，话又说回来，用谁都一样。我只知道，我早就怀疑伊万·谢苗诺维奇了。很早之前，我就注意到这个老家伙多么令人厌恶和恐怖——他们说他放高利贷，收取利息，就跟犹太人一样。在整件事中，这个蠢货一定是罪魁祸首。谁都能察觉到这个蠢货在这件事里插手。事情就这么开始了。先是从伊兹梅洛夫桥开始的，这一切就这么开始了……”","“It’s a poor look out!” he thought.“Eh, it’s a bad business, a bad business!Ech! things are in a bad way with us now!What does it all mean?What did that drunkard’s insinuations mean, for instance, and whose trickery was it?Ah! I know whose it was.And what a thing this is.No doubt they found out and made him sit there...But, after all, did they sit him there?It was Andrey Filippovitch sat him there and with what object?Probably they found out...That is Vahramyev’s work — that is, not Vahramyev, he is as stupid as an ashen post, Vahramyev is, and they are all at work on his behalf, and they egged that scoundrel on to come here for the same purpose, and the German woman brought up her grievance, the one-eyed hussy.I always suspected that this intrigue was not without an object and that in all this old-womanish gossip there must be something, and I said as much to Krestyan Ivanovitch, telling him they’d sworn to cut a man’s throat — in a moral sense, of course — and they pounced upon Karolina Ivanovna.Yes, there are master hands at work in this, one can see!Yes, sir, there are master hands at work in this, not Vahramyev’s.I’ve said already that Vahramyev is stupid, but ... I know who it is behind it all, it’s that rascal, that impostor!It’s only that he relies upon, which is partly proved by his successes in the best society.And it would certainly be desirable to know on what footing he stands now.What is he now among them?Only, why have they taken Ivan Semyonovitch?What the devil do they want with Ivan Semyonovitch?Could not they have found any one else?Though it would come to the same thing whoever it had been, and the only thing I know is that I have suspected Ivan Semyonovitch for a long time past.I noticed long ago what a nasty, horrid old man he was — they say he lends money and takes interest like any Jew.To be sure, the bear’s the leading spirit in the whole affair.One can detect the bear in the whole affair.It began in this way.It began at the Ismailovsky Bridge; that’s how it began ...”"
"这时，戈利亚德金先生皱了皱眉头，像咬了一口柠檬似的，大概他想起了什么很不愉快的事情。","At this point Mr. Golyadkin frowned, as though he had taken a bite out of a lemon, probably remembering something very unpleasant."
"“不过呢，那也没关系。”他想，“我老是对自己的麻烦事喋喋不休。奥斯塔菲耶夫会发现些什么线索呢？他很可能因为什么事在办公室走不开，或被耽搁。从某种意义上讲，这是个好事。我也会搞阴谋了，也能设圈套算计别人了。我只在奥斯塔菲耶夫身上花了十个戈比……他就站在我这边了。但问题是，他真的站在我这边了吗？说不定他们也收买了他……而且他们也通过收买他串通了阴谋。他看起来就像个流氓，无赖，地地道道的无赖。这个坏蛋没说实话。他说：‘不，没什么。’还说：‘我由衷地感谢您，大人。’你这个流氓，流氓！”","“But, there, it doesn’t matter,” he thought.“I keep harping on my own troubles.What will Ostafyev find out?Most likely he is staying on or has been delayed somehow.It is a good thing, in a sense, that I am intriguing like this, and am laying mines on my side too.I’ve only to give Ostafyev ten kopecks and he’s ... so to speak, on my side.Only the point is, is he really on my side?Perhaps they’ve got him on their side too ... and they are carrying on an intrigue by means of him on their side too.He looks a ruffian, the rascal, a regular ruffian; he’s hiding something, the rogue.‘No, nothing,’ says he, ‘and I am deeply grateful to your honour.’ says he.You ruffian, you!”"
"他听到一个声音……戈利亚德金先生缩起了身子，跳到了炉子后面。有人下了楼，走到了街上。“谁会现在出去？”我们的主人公暗自想到。过了一分钟，他又听到了脚步声……这时，戈利亚德金先生忍不住了，从角落里探出鼻尖——他刚一探出，又立即缩了回去，就像有人在上面用针扎了一下似的。这回走过去的是戈利亚德金先生熟知的一个人，就是那个骗子，耍阴谋的人，该入地狱的家伙——他照例迈着小碎步，步伐匆忙，好像要去踢谁似的。","He heard a noise ... Mr. Golyadkin shrank up and skipped behind the stove.Some one came down stairs and went out into the street.“Who could that be going away now?” our hero thought to himself.A minute later footsteps were audible again ... At this point Mr. Golyadkin could not resist poking the very tip of his nose out beyond his corner — he poked it out and instantly withdrew it again, as though some one had pricked it with a pin.This time some one he knew well was coming — that is the scoundrel, the intriguer and the reprobate — he was approaching with his usual mean, tripping little step, prancing and shuffling with his feet as though he were going to kick some one."
"“这个流氓!”我们的主人公自言自语说。","“The rascal,” said our hero to himself."
"不过，戈利亚德金先生无法不注意到，这个恶棍腋下夹着一个很大的绿色公文包，是司长大人的。","Mr. Golyadkin could not, however, help observing that the rascal had under his arm a huge green portfolio belonging to his Excellency."
"“他又受到了特别委托。”戈利亚德金先生心想，因恼怒而面红耳赤，身体缩得比以前更厉害了。","“He’s on a special commission again,” thought Mr. Golyadkin, flushing crimson and shrinking into himself more than ever from vexation."
"小戈利亚德金先生根本没注意到老戈利亚德金先生，刚从他身边走过，后者就第三次听见了脚步声。这次，戈利亚德金先生猜是奥斯塔菲耶夫的声音。的确是个满面油光的复印员，不过不是奥斯塔菲耶夫，而是皮萨连科。这让戈利亚德金先生吃了一惊。他为什么要和别人一起搅和进他们的秘密呢？我们的主人公不得其解。一群多么野蛮的人啊！他们心中就没有什么神圣的东西！“喂，朋友？”他从角落里出来，问皮萨连科，“谁派你出来的，朋友？”","As soon as Mr. Golyadkin junior had slipped past Mr. Golyadkin senior without observing him in the least, footsteps were heard for the third time, and this time Mr. Golyadkin guessed that these were Ostafyev’s.It was, in fact, the sleek figure of a copying clerk, Pisarenko by name.This surprised Mr. Golyadkin.Why had he mixed up other people in their secret? our hero wondered.our hero wondered.What barbarians!What barbarians! nothing is sacred to them!“Well, my friend?” he brought out, addressing Pisarenko: “who sent you, my friend?…”...”"
"“我出来就是为了您的事。到现在为止，还没有从任何人那里打听到消息。但是，一有消息，我们会通知您。”","“I’ve come about your business.There’s no news so far from any one.But should there be any we’ll let you know.”"
"“奥斯塔菲耶夫呢？”","“And Ostafyev?”"
"“大人，他出不来。司长已经在屋里转悠两次了。我也没时间跟您多说了。”","“It was quite impossible for him to come, your honour.His Excellency has walked through the room twice, and I’ve no time to stay.”"
"“谢谢，谢谢你了，大好人……不过，请你告诉我……”","“Thank you, my good man, thank you ... only, tell me ...”"
"“真是没时间了，先生，我得走了……他们随时都会需要我们……但是，如果大人您呆在这里，若有任何关于您的小事的事情发生，我们会通知您。”","“Upon my word, sir, I can’t stay...They are asking for us every minute ... but if your honour will stay here, we’ll let you know if anything happens concerning your little affair.”"
"“不，我的朋友，请你告诉我……”","“No, my friend, you just tell me ...”"
"“对不起，先生，我没时间呆在这里了。”皮萨连科说。戈利亚德金先生抓住他的大衣衣领，他拼命地挣脱。“我真的要走了。如果大人您在这儿等，我们一定会通知您。”","“Excuse me, I’ve no time to stay, sir,” said Pisarenko, tearing himself away from Mr. Golyadkin, who had clutched him by the lapel of his coat.“I really can’t.If your honour will stay here we’ll let you know.”"
"“一分钟，大好人，就一分钟！就一分钟，伙计！我对你说，这里有封信。我会感谢你的，大好人。”","“In a minute, my good man, in a minute!In a minute, my good fellow!I tell you what, here’s a letter; and I’ll reward you, my good man.”"
"“好的，先生。”","“Yes, sir.”"
"“亲爱的伙计，想办法把它交给戈利亚德金先生。”","“Try and give it to Mr. Golyadkin my dear fellow.”"
"“戈利亚德金？”","“Golyadkin?”"
"“是的，伙计，交给戈利亚德金先生。”","“Yes, my man, to Mr. Golyadkin.”"
"“好的，先生。我一有机会离开，就交给他。现在，您就呆在这儿吧。没有人会看见您的……”","“Very good, sir; as soon as I get off I’ll take it, and you stay here, meanwhile; no one will see you here ... ”"
"“不，大好人，别乱想……我站在这里不是想避免被别人看见。不过，现在，我不在这儿呆了，朋友……我到附近的街上去。离这儿不远处有一个咖啡店。所以，我会在那儿等，如果有什么事情发生，你一定要告诉我。明白吗？”","“No, my good man, don’t imagine ... I’m not standing here to avoid being seen.But I’m not going to stay here now, my friend...I’ll be close here in the side of the street.There’s a coffee-house near here; so I’ll wait there, and if anything happens, you let me know about anything, you understand?”"
"“好的，先生。只是，让我走吧。我明白。”","“Very good, sir.Only let me go; I understand.”"
"“我会感谢你的。”戈利亚德金先生终于放开了皮萨连科，冲着他的背影喊道……","“And I’ll reward you,” Mr. Golyadkin called after Pisarenko, when he had at last released him..."
"“这个无赖似乎变得越来越没礼貌了。”我们的主人公一边偷偷地从炉子后面走出来，一边想着，“他肯定在故意回避。这很清楚……起初还这个那个的……不过，他的确是着急。也许，办公室有一堆事情等着他去做。司长又在屋里巡查了两次……这是怎么回事呀？……唉！算了！这也许没什么。咱们现在等着瞧吧……”","“The rogue seemed to be getting rather rude,” our hero reflected as he stealthily emerged from behind the stove.“There’s some other dodge here.That’s clear ... At first it was one thing and another ... he really was in a hurry, though; perhaps there’s a great deal to do in the office.And his Excellency had been through the room twice ... How did that happen?... Ough! never mind!never mind!… Ough! never mind! it may mean nothing, perhaps; but now we shall see...”"
"这时，戈利亚德金先生准备打开门，想要到街上去。突然，就在这一瞬间，司长的马车门开了，一位先生跳了下来。这位先生不是别人，正是十分钟前离开这里的小戈利亚德金先生。老戈利亚德金先生想起来了，司长的公寓离这里只有几步之遥。","At this point Mr. Golyadkin was about to open the door, intending to go out into the street, when suddenly, at that very instant, his Excellency’s carriage was opened from within and a gentleman jumped out.This gentleman was no other than Mr. Golyadkin junior, who had only gone out ten minutes before.Mr. Golyadkin senior remembered that the Director’s flat was only a couple of paces away."
"“他出去是办受特别委托的事了。”我们的主人公心里想。","“He has been out on a special commission,” our hero thought to himself."
"与此同时，小戈利亚德金先生从马车里拿出一个厚厚的绿色公文包，以及其他一些文件。最后，他吩咐马车夫几句话后，推开了门，几乎撞到了老戈利亚德金先生身上。可是，小戈利亚德金先生故意装作没有看见他。他这样做是故意惹怒老戈利亚德金先生。接着，他在楼梯上一溜小跑，很快就进了办公室。","Meanwhile, Mr. Golyadkin junior took out of the carriage a thick green portfolio and other papers.Finally, giving some orders to the coachman, he opened the door, almost ran up against Mr. Golyadkin senior, purposely avoided noticing him, acting in this way expressly to annoy him, and mounted the office staircase at a rapid canter."
"“前景不妙。”戈利亚德金先生心里想，“现在一定是事情发生了！噢，我的天！瞧瞧他那样子。”","“It’s a bad look out,” thought Mr. Golyadkin.“This is what it has come to now!Oh, good Lord! look at him.”look at him.”"
"我们的主人公一动不动地站了足足半分钟。最后，他终于下定了决心。他没有停下来仔细考虑就跟着他的敌人跑上了楼梯，虽然他感觉到心在剧烈地跳动，四肢在发抖。","For half a minute our hero remained motionless.At last he made up his mind.Without pausing to think, though he was aware of a violent palpitation of the heart and a tremor in all his limbs, he ran up the stair after his enemy."
"“就这样，豁出去了。跟我有什么关系？我和这事没有任何牵连。”他一边心里想着，一边在前厅摘下礼帽，脱下大衣和靴子。","“Here goes; what does it matter to me?I have nothing to do with the case,” he thought, taking off his hat, his greatcoat and his goloshes in the entry."
"戈利亚德金先生走进自己的办公室时，天已经快黑了。安德雷·菲利波维奇和安东·安东诺维奇都不在办公室。他们两个现在都在司长办公室，正呈交报告。据说，司长也急着向上一级领导汇报。这样，暮色不断降临，下班时间已经快到了。我们的主人公进去时，几个职员，尤其是几个年轻职员，正无所事事地休闲。他们聚在一起聊天、争辩、大笑。有些最年轻的人，也就是职位最低的一些人，正在窗户下的角落里玩抛硬币猜正反面的游戏。戈利亚德金先生知书达理，他感觉现在是需要与他们协调关系、友好相处的时刻。所以，他立即向几个过去与他关系不错的人走去，去问好，等等。但是，他的同事们对于他的问好回应得有点奇怪。大家对他有些冷淡，甚至有点无礼，用严峻来形容他们的态度也不为过。对此，戈利亚德金先生感到很不高兴。没有人和他握手。有些人只是简简单单地说了句“你好”，就走开了；有些人只是点了点头而已；还有一个人干脆转过身去，装作没看见他；最后，还有些人——也是使戈利亚德金先生觉得最受辱的，即一些职位最低的年轻人。这些毛头小子一事无成，就像戈利亚德金先生亲眼看到的那样，只知道一有机会就玩猜硬币游戏——竟然慢慢地围住了戈利亚德金先生，围成一个圈，几乎堵住了他的路。他们都用一种带着侮辱的好奇眼神看着戈利亚德金先生。","When Mr. Golyadkin walked into his office, it was already getting dusk.Neither Andrey Filippovitch nor Anton Antonovitch were in the room.Both of them were in the Director’s room, handing in reports.The Director, so it was rumoured, was in haste to report to a still higher Excellency.In consequence of this, and also because twilight was coming on, and the office hours were almost over, several of the clerks, especially the younger ones, were, at the moment when our hero entered, enjoying a period of inactivity; gathered together in groups, they were talking, arguing, and laughing, and some of the most youthful — that is, belonging to the lowest grades in the service, had got up a game of pitch-farthing in a corner, by a window.Knowing what was proper, and feeling at the moment a special need to conciliate and get on with them, Mr. Golyadkin immediately approached those with him he used to get on best, in order to wish them good day, and so on.But his colleagues answered his greetings rather strangely.He was unpleasantly impressed by a certain coldness, even curtness, one might almost say severity in their manner.No one shook hands with him.Some simply said, “Good day” and walked away; others barely nodded; one simply turned away and pretended not to notice him; at last some of them — and what mortified Mr. Golyadkin most of all, some of the youngsters of the lowest grades, mere lads who, as Mr. Golyadkin justly observed about them, were capable of nothing but hanging about and playing pitch-farthing at every opportunity — little by little collected round Mr. Golyadkin, formed a group round him and almost barred his way.They all looked at him with a sort of insulting curiosity."
"这不是个好兆头。戈利亚德金先生察觉到了这一点，而且明智地决定忽视它。突然，一件出人预料的事情，正如俗话所说，把戈利亚德金先生彻底打入万劫不复之地。","It was a bad sign.Mr. Golyadkin felt this, and very judiciously decided not to notice it.Suddenly a quite unexpected event completely finished him off, as they say, and utterly crushed him."
"这个时候，最令老戈利亚德金先生恼怒的是，围在他身旁的这群职员当中突然出现了小戈利亚德金先生的身影，这就像是预先设计好的似的。小戈利亚德金先生像往常一样快活，面带一丝微笑，也很灵活。总之，他淘气地来回跳跃，咯咯地笑着，奉承着周围的人。他的口舌之伶俐，脚步之轻快，跟往日一样。比如说，前一天他就是这样，当时，老戈利亚德金先生很不愉快。","At the moment most trying to Mr. Golyadkin senior, suddenly, as though by design, there appeared in the group of fellow clerks surrounding him the figure of Mr. Golyadkin junior, gay as ever, smiling a little smile as ever, nimble, too, as ever; in short, mischievous, skipping and tripping, chuckling and fawning, with sprightly tongue and sprightly toe, as always, precisely as he had been the day before at a very unpleasant moment for Mr. Golyadkin senior, for instance."
"他咧着嘴笑，轻快地走来走去，脸上的笑容似乎在跟大家说着“晚上好”。他挤进一群职员当中，和这个握握手，拍拍那个的肩膀，拥抱一下下一个，又对另外一个解释说他是如何受到司长重用、去了哪儿、做了些什么、带回来些什么，到了第五个人那儿，大概那人是他最亲密的朋友，他吻了人家一下，还发出了响声——事实上，这发生的一切都跟戈利亚德金先生梦中的情景一样。小戈利亚德金先生来回跳跃，直到他自己心满意足。他用自己一贯的方式跟所有人都寒暄了一番，把他们都拉到自己这边，不管自己是否用得着他们。他对所有人都慷慨地巴结了一通，让所有人都心情愉悦后，突然把手伸向了老戈利亚德金先生。他这么做很可能是搞错了，因为他还没来得及注意老戈利亚德金先生。大概也是搞错了——尽管我们的主人公有足够的时间观察这个可耻的小戈利亚德金先生，他还是迫不及待地抓住了这只出其不意伸过来的手，用最友好最热情的方式紧紧握住了它。他此时怀着一种奇怪、完全出乎预料的内心情感，似乎要潸然泪下。我们的主人公是被他那可耻的敌人的第一举动欺骗了，还是吃了一惊，或是心底感到无助却没有意识到——这就不得而知了。事实仍然是，老戈利亚德金先生在理智完全清醒的状态下，出于自愿，在有人见证的情况下，和自己称之为死敌的小戈利亚德金先生庄重地握了手。但是，他的仇人和死敌，那个可耻的小戈利亚德金先生发现自己和这个被人迫害、无辜地遭到背信弃义的欺骗的人握手这个错误时，毫无羞愧和怜悯之情，也无同情和道义之心，把手抽了回来，粗鲁无礼地让人忍无可忍。这多么令老戈利亚德金先生感到惊愕、茫然、气愤、恐慌和羞耻啊！更可恶的是，他还甩了甩手，就像他的手被什么恐怖的脏东西污染了似的。另外，他恶心地往旁边啐了一口唾沫，还做了一个最侮辱人的手势。还有更糟糕的，他掏出了自己的手帕，用最无礼的方式擦了擦他刚才与老戈利亚德金先生握过的每一根手指。小戈利亚德金先生一边做着这些动作，一边用他那特有的令人讨厌的眼神往四处看看，确保所有人都看见他在做什么。他看着所有人的眼睛，显然在极力暗示大家所有对老戈利亚德金先生最为不利的事。小戈利亚德金先生令人厌恶的行为似乎引起了周围职员的普遍不满，甚至那些轻佻的年轻人也显露出自己的不快。周围的人开始不满而纷纷议论。老戈利亚德金先生不可能不注意这样大范围的情绪骚动。但是，小戈利亚德金先生突然冒出了一句恰如其分的俏皮话，粉碎和毁灭了我们的主人公的最后希望。刚才的均势又倾斜了，他那该死的受之有愧的死敌又占了上风。","Grinning, tripping and turning with a smile that seemed to say “good evening,” to every one, he squeezed his way into the group of clerks, shaking hands with one, slapping another on the shoulder, putting his arm round another, explaining to a fourth how he had come to be employed by his Excellency, where he had been, what he had done, what he had brought with him; to the fifth, probably his most intimate friend, he gave a resounding kiss — in fact, everything happened as it had in Mr. Golyadkin’s dream.When he had skipped about to his heart’s content, polished them all off in his usual way, disposed them all in his favour, whether he needed them or not, when he had lavished his blandishments to the delectation of all the clerks, Mr. Golyadkin junior suddenly, and most likely by mistake, for he had not yet had time to notice his senior, held out his hand to Mr. Golyadkin senior also.Probably also by mistake — though he had had time to observe the dishonourable Mr. Golyadkin junior thoroughly, our hero at once eagerly seized the hand so unexpectedly held out to him and pressed it in the warmest and friendliest way, pressed it with a strange, quite unexpected, inner feeling, with a tearful emotion.Whether our hero was misled by the first movement of his worthless foe, or was taken unawares, or, without recognizing it, felt at the bottom of his heart how defenceless he was — it is difficult to say.The fact remains that Mr. Golyadkin senior, apparently knowing what he was doing, of his own free will, before witnesses, solemnly shook hands with him whom he called his mortal foe.But what was the amazement, the stupefaction and fury, what was the horror and the shame of Mr. Golyadkin senior, when his enemy and mortal foe, the dishonourable Mr. Golyadkin junior, noticing the mistake of that persecuted, innocent, perfidiously deceived man, without a trace of shame, of feeling, of compassion or of conscience, pulled his hand away with insufferable rudeness and insolence.What was worse, he shook the hand as though it had been polluted with something horrid; what is more, he spat aside with disgust, accompanying this with a most insulting gesture; worse still, he drew out his handkerchief and, in the most unseemly way, wiped all the fingers that had rested for one moment in the hand of Mr. Golyadkin senior.While he did this Mr. Golyadkin junior looked about him in his characteristic horrid way, took care that every one should see what he was doing, glanced into people’s eyes and evidently tried to insinuate to every one everything that was most unpleasant in regard to Mr. Golyadkin senior.Mr. Golyadkin junior’s revolting behaviour seemed to arouse general indignation among the clerks that surrounded them; even the frivolous youngsters showed their displeasure.A murmur of protest rose on all sides.Mr. Golyadkin could not but discern the general feeling; but suddenly — an appropriate witticism that bubbled from the lips of Mr. Golyadkin junior shattered, annihilated our hero’s last hopes, and inclined the balance again in favour of his deadly and undeserving foe."
"“诸位，这是我们俄国的福布拉斯。请允许我给大家介绍这位年轻的福布拉斯。”小戈利亚德金先生尖声尖气地说，带着他特有的傲慢，在职员中踮着脚穿来穿去，把他们的注意力都引向这个呆若木鸡的真戈利亚德金先生。“咱们亲一个吧，亲爱的。”他用一种超出人可忍受范围的亲密语气对这个他阴险地侮辱过的人说道。卑鄙无耻的小戈利亚德金先生的这句俏皮话似乎得到了广泛的回应，因为这句话还巧妙地暗示着一个早已公开为大家所知的情况。我们的主人公痛苦地感觉到了敌人的魔爪。不过，现在他已经拿定了主意。他目光炽热，脸色苍白，脸上挂着呆滞的笑容。他从人群中挤了出来，步伐匆忙而踉跄，径直朝司长的私人办公室走去。在倒数第二个房间里，刚从司长办公室出来的安德雷·菲利波维奇会见了他。虽然此刻屋里有很多戈利亚德金先生完全不认识的人，但我们的主人公不屑于理会这一点。他大胆、坚决地径直上前去和安德雷·菲利波维奇搭话，丝毫没有浪费时间。连他自己都对此有点疑惑，在心底崇拜着自己的胆量，而对方对这意料之外的搭话十分惊讶。","“He’s our Russian Faublas, gentlemen; allow me to introduce the youthful Faublas,” piped Mr. Golyadkin junior, with his characteristic insolence, pirouetting and threading his way among the clerks, and directing their attention to the petrified though genuine Mr. Golyadkin.“Let us kiss each other, darling,” he went on with insufferable familiarity, addressing the man he had so treacherously insulted.Mr. Golyadkin junior’s unworthy jest seemed to touch a responsive chord, for it contained an artful allusion to an incident with which all were apparently familiar.Our hero was painfully conscious of the hand of his enemies.But he had made up his mind by now.With glowing eyes, with pale face, with a fixed smile he tore himself somehow out of the crowd and with uneven, hurried steps made straight for his Excellency’s private room.In the room next to the last he was met by Andrey Filippovitch, who had only just come out from seeing his Excellency, and although there were present in this room at the moment a good number of persons of whom Mr. Golyadkin knew nothing, yet our hero did not care to take such a fact into consideration.Boldly, resolutely, directly, almost wondering at himself and inwardly admiring his own courage, without loss of time he accosted Andrey Filippovitch, who was a good deal surprised by the unexpected attack."
"“啊……怎么了……你想做什么？”科长问，他没有听清楚戈利亚德金先生吞吞吐吐在说什么。","“Ah!“Ah! ... What is it ... what do you want?” asked the head of the division, not hearing Mr. Golyadkin’s hesitant words."
"“安德雷·菲利波维奇，我……我可以……安德雷·菲利波维奇，我可以马上和司长单独谈谈吗？”我们的主人公坚定而又清晰地说，最为决然的目光直视着安德雷·菲利波维奇。","“Andrey Filippovitch, may ... might I, Andrey Filippovitch, may I have a conversation with his Excellency at once and in private?” our hero said resolutely and distinctly, fixing the most determined glance on Andrey Filippovitch."
"“荒唐！当然不行！”安德雷·菲利波维奇从头到脚打量着戈利亚德金先生。","“What next! of course not.”of course not.”Andrey Filippovitch scanned Mr. Golyadkin from head to foot."
"“安德雷·菲利波维奇，我提出这个要求，是因为我很惊讶，这里怎么没有一个人出来揭露那个冒充别人的骗子，那个卑鄙小人！” ","“I say all this, Andrey Filippovitch, because I am surprised that no-one here unmasks the imposter and scoundrel.”"
"“什……什……什么？”","“Wha-a-at!”"
"“我说卑鄙小人，安德雷·菲利波维奇！”","“Scoundrel, Andrey Filippovitch!”"
"“您这是说谁呀？”","“Of whom are you pleased to speak in those terms?”"
"“我在说某个人，安德雷·菲利波维奇。我在暗示某人，安德雷·菲利波维奇。我有权……我想，安德雷·菲利波维奇，领导肯定会鼓励这种做法。”戈利亚德金先生又补充说，显然他已经几乎不知所云了。“安德雷·菲利波维奇……毫无疑问，您自己也明白，安德雷·菲利波维奇，这种高尚的行为标志着我的无限忠诚——把上司看成父亲，安德雷·菲利波维奇。我是想说，我把仁慈友爱的上司看成父亲，毫无保留地把我的命运交给了他。就是这样的……你明白……”说到这儿，戈利亚德金先生的声音颤抖了，两行热泪顺着睫毛流下。","“Of a certain person, Andrey Filippovitch; I’m alluding, Andrey Filippovitch, to a certain person; I have the right ... I imagine, Andrey Filippovitch, that the authorities would surely encourage such action,” added Mr. Golyadkin, evidently hardly knowing what he was saying.“Andrey Filippovitch ... but no doubt you see yourself, Andrey Filippovitch, that this honourable action is a mark of my loyalty in every way — of my looking upon my superior as a father, Andrey Filippovitch; I as much as to say look upon my benevolent superior as a father and blindly trust my fate to him.It’s as much as to say ... you see ... ” At this point Mr. Golyadkin’s voice trembled and two tears ran down his eyelashes."
"安德雷·菲利波维奇听着戈利亚德金先生说的话，万分惊讶，不由自主地往后退了好几步。然后，他不安地四处看了看……很难说这事会怎么结束。司长办公室的门突然开了，他走出来，几名官员陪同着他。房间里所有的人都尾随其后，排成了一队。司长把安德雷·菲利波维奇叫到身边，与他一起走着，谈论一些商务琐事。大家都起身走出房间后，戈利亚德金先生才醒悟过来。","As Andrey Filippovitch listened to Mr. Golyadkin he was so astonished that he could not help stepping back a couple of paces.Then he looked about him uneasily ... It is difficult to say how the matter would have ended.But suddenly the door of his Excellency’s room was opened, and he himself came out, accompanied by several officials.All the persons in his room followed in a string.His Excellency called to Andrey Filippovitch and walked beside him, beginning to discuss some business details.When all had set off and gone out of the room, Mr. Golyadkin woke up."
"定了定神，他到安东·安东诺维奇身旁寻求庇护。安东·安东诺维奇走在队伍的后面，戈利亚德金先生觉得他神色严峻、忧心忡忡。“刚才我真是胡说八道了一通，又把事情搞得一团糟。不过，没关系。”他心想。","Growing calmer, he took refuge under the wing of Anton Antonovitch, who came last in the procession and who, Mr. Golyadkin fancied, looked stern and anxious.“I’ve been talking nonsense, I’ve been making a mess of it again, but there, never mind,” he thought."
"“我希望，至少，安东·安东诺维奇您能同意听我说，站在我的立场上想一想。”他轻轻地说，声音还有点颤抖，“因为大家都拒绝我，我请求您听我说。我还是对安德雷·菲利波维奇的话不明白，安东·安东诺维奇。请您为我解释一下，如果您可以的话……”","“I hope, at least, that you, Anton Antonovitch will consent to listen to me and to enter into my position,” he said quietly, in a voice that still trembled a little.“Rejected by all, I appeal to you.I am still at a loss to understand what Andrey Filippovitch’s words mean, Anton Antonovitch.Explain them to me if you can ...”"
"“到时候，所有的事情都会真相大白的。”安东·安东诺维奇回答说，语气坚决果断。戈利亚德金先生觉得，从对方的态度可以很轻易地看出，安东·安东诺维奇不想把这场对话继续下去。“你很快就会知道一切的。今天，你将会收到关于这一切的官方通知。”","“Everything will be explained in due time,” Anton Antonovitch replied sternly and emphatically, and as Mr. Golyadkin fancied with an air that gave him plainly to understand that Anton Antonovitch did not wish to continue the conversation.“You will soon know all about it.You will be officially informed about everything today.”"
"“‘官方通知’是什么意思，安东·安东诺维奇？为什么是官方呢？”我们的主人公怯怯地问。","“What do you mean by officially informed, Anton Antonovitch?Why officially?” our hero asked timidly."
"“我们的上司如何定夺这件事，不是你我该讨论的，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇。”","“It is not for you and me to discuss what our superiors decide upon, Yakov Petrovitch.”"
"“为什么我们的上司要定夺这件事呢，安东·安东诺维奇？”我们的主人公问，显得更怯懦了，“为什么是我们的上司呢？我看不出来有什么理由麻烦我们的上司来处理这件事，安东·安东诺维奇……也许你的意思是针对昨天的事情说两句，安东·安东诺维奇？”","“Why our superiors, Anton Antonovitch?” said our hero, still more intimidated; “why our superiors?I don’t see what reason there is to trouble our superiors in the matter, Anton Antonovitch ... Perhaps you mean to say something about yesterday’s doings, Anton Antonovitch?”"
"“哦，不，和昨天的事没有任何关系。你在别的事情上出现了些失误。”","“Oh no, nothing to do with yesterday; there’s something else amiss with you.”"
"“什么事情出了差错，安东·安东诺维奇？安东·安东诺维奇，我相信我没有做错什么。”","“What is there amiss, Anton Antonovitch?I believe, Anton Antonovitch, that I have done nothing amiss.”"
"“嗯，您是不是准备跟什么人耍计谋？”安东·安东诺维奇突然打断了他的话说道，戈利亚德金先生惊愕不已。","“Why, you were meaning to be sly with some one,” Anton Antonovitch cut in sharply, completely flabbergasting Mr. Golyadkin."
"戈利亚德金先生打了个寒颤，脸色变得像手帕一样苍白。","Mr. Golyadkin started, and turned as white as a pocket-handkerchief."
"“当然，安东·安东诺维奇，”他说，声音低得几乎无法听见，“如果人们听信诽谤和敌人的谣言，而不理会另一方的辩白，那么，当然……那么，当然，安东·安东诺维奇，好人会平白无故地蒙受不白之冤。”","“Of course, Anton Antonovitch,” he said, in a voice hardly audible, “if one listens to the voice of calumny and hears one’s enemies’ tales, without heeding what the other side has to say in its defence, then, of course ... then, of course, Anton Antonovitch, one must suffer innocently and for nothing.”"
"“确实如此。不过您那不体面的行为损坏了一位年轻女士的清誉。而她所属的那个积德行善、高贵知名的大户人家待你不薄……”","“To be sure; but your unseemly conduct, in injuring the reputation of a virtuous young lady belonging to that benevolent, highly distinguished and well-known family who had befriended you ...”"
"“你指的是什么行为，安东·安东诺维奇？”","“What conduct do you mean, Anton Antonovitch?”"
"“我指的是那件事。你还记得你对那个贫寒却很可敬的外国年轻女士所做的好事吗？真是值得赞扬呀。”","“What I say.Do you know anything about your praiseworthy conduct in regard to that other young lady who, though poor, is of honourable foreign extraction?”"
"“请允许我，安东·安东诺维奇……如果您发善心，肯听我说，安东·安东诺维奇……”","“Allow me, Anton Antonovitch ... if you would kindly listen to me, Anton Antonovitch ...”"
"“还有你背信弃义的行为，对别人的诽谤，把自己的罪行强加在另一个人头上。啊，你又作何解释呢？”","“And your treacherous behaviour and slander of another person, your charging another person with your own sins.Ah, what do you call that?”"
"“我并没有赶他走，安东·安东诺维奇，”我们的主人公颤抖着说，“我也从来没有指使彼得鲁什卡，我的仆人，做过这样的事情……他吃了我的面包，安东·安东诺维奇，他利用了我的好客。”我们的主人公接着说。他的表情如此丰富，感情如此深沉，下巴颤动起来，眼泪又要夺眶而出了。","“I did not send him away, Anton Antonovitch,” said our hero, with a tremor; “and I’ve never instructed Petrushka, my man, to do anything of the sort ... He has eaten my bread, Anton Antonovitch, he has taken advantage of my hospitality,” our hero added expressively and with deep emotion, so much so that his chin twitched a little and tears were ready to start again."
"“这只是你的一面之词，说他吃了你的面包。”安东·安东诺维奇回答说。他似乎被激怒了，言辞里带着不信任，这使得戈利亚德金先生的心灵很受伤。","“That is only your talk, that he has eaten your bread,” answered Anton Antonovitch, somewhat offended, and there was a perfidious note in his voice which sent a pang to Mr. Golyadkin’s heart."
"“安东·安东诺维奇，请允许我谦卑地再问您一句，司长知道这些事情吗？”","“Allow me most humbly to ask you again, Anton Antonovitch, is his Excellency aware of all this business?”"
"“我确定他不知道。不过你得让我走了。我现在没时间和你说话……今天，你会知道你想知道的一切。”","“Upon my word, you must let me go now, though.I’ve not time for you now...You’ll know everything you need to know today.”"
"“看在上帝的份上，给我一分钟时间，安东·安东诺维奇。”","“Allow me, for God’s sake, one minute, Anton Antonovitch.”"
"“之后再告诉我……”","“Tell me afterwards...”"
"“不，安东·安东诺维奇，我……你知道的，安东·安东诺维奇……你只需要听我说……我不赞成自由思想，安东·安东诺维奇，我对自由思想避之不及。我自己准备好了……而且，事实上，我已经完全放弃那样的想法……”","“No, Anton Antonovitch; I ... you see, Anton Antonovitch ... only listen ... I am not one for freethinking, Anton Antonovitch; I shun freethinking; I am quite ready for my part ... and, indeed, I’ve given up that idea...”"
"“好，很好。我已经听说了。”","“Very good, very good.I’ve heard that already.”"
"“不，您还没听说过，安东·安东诺维奇。我想说的是别的事情，安东·安东诺维奇。这是件好事，真的，是件好事，听起来很令人愉快……我之前已经跟你解释过，安东·安东诺维奇，我承认，神圣的上帝创造了两个完全一样的人，而且仁慈的政府看到上帝之意后收留了这对双胞胎。这是件好事，安东·安东诺维奇，我远离自由思想。我把我仁慈博爱的政府视为父亲，对一切都言听计从。你是个仁爱的官员，你，当然……一个年轻人总得做些事情……安东·安东诺维奇，请你站在我的角度，为我出头……我很好……安东·安东诺维奇，看在上帝的份上，替我美言几句……安东·安东诺维奇……”","“No, you have not heard it, Anton Antonovitch.It is something else, Anton Antonovitch: it’s a good thing, really, a good thing and pleasant to hear ... As I’ve explained to you, Anton Antonovitch, I admit that idea, that divine Providence has created two men exactly alike, and that a benevolent government, seeing the hand of Providence, provided a berth for two twins.That is a good thing, Anton Antonovitch, and that I am very far from freethinking.I look upon my benevolent government as a father; I say ‘yes,’ by all means; you are benevolent authorities, and you, of course ... A young man must be in the service ... Stand up for me, Anton Antonovitch, take my part, Anton Antonovitch ... I am all right ... Anton Antonovitch, for God’s sake, one little word more...Anton Antonovitch...”"
"但是，安东·安东诺维奇现在已经走了，离戈利亚德金先生有很远一段距离……我们的主人公对发生的这一切和他听到的这一切感到疑惑，不知所措。他不知道自己在哪里，听到了些什么，做了些什么，别人对他做了些什么，他以后会遭受些什么。","But by now Anton Antonovitch was far away from Mr. Golyadkin ... Our hero was so bewildered and overcome by all that had happened and all that he had heard that he did not know where he was standing, what he had heard, what he had done, what was being done to him, and what was going to be done to him."
"他带着哀求的目光，在一群职员中寻找安东·安东诺维奇的身影，想再辩解一番，改变他的看法。他还想对他说一些溢美之词，让人愉悦，也让他自己觉得可信……然而，一线新光慢慢开始照在我们主人公迷茫的心灵上。这线新的可怕的光立刻揭开了一个完整的角度，迄今为止不为人所知、完全未被怀疑的情况的角度……这时，有人突然推了一下我们疑惑的主人公。他四下里看了看。皮萨连科就站在他面前。","With imploring eyes he sought for Anton Antonovitch in the crowd of clerks, that he might justify himself further in his eyes and say something to him extremely high toned and very agreeable, and creditable to himself...By degrees, however, a new light began to break upon our hero’s bewildered mind, a new and awful light that revealed at once a whole perspective of hitherto unknown and utterly unsuspected circumstances ... At that moment somebody gave our bewildered hero a poke in the ribs.He looked around.Pisarenko was standing before him."
"“大人，您的信。”","“A letter, your honour.”"
"“啊，你去啦，大好人。”","“Ah, you’ve been taken out already, my good man?”"
"“不，这是上午十点钟送过来的。那个叫谢尔盖·米赫拉夫的侍者从瓦赫拉梅耶夫先生家送过来的。”","“No, it was brought at ten o’clock this morning.Sergey Mihyeev, the attendant, brought it from Mr. Vahramyev’s lodging.”"
"“太好了，太好了，好伙计，我会感谢你的。”","“Very good, very good, and I’ll reward you now, my dear fellow.”"
"戈利亚德金先生说着把信塞进他制服的侧面口袋里，扣上扣子。然后，他向周围看了看，惊讶地发现自己现在站在司里的大厅中，外面的门前围着一群职员，因为此时已经是下班时间了。直到此刻，戈利亚德金先生才发现这个情况，也才意识到他突然穿上大衣和靴子，手里握着礼帽。所有的职员都静静地站着，恭恭敬敬地等候。事实上，司长正站在楼梯下面，等他的马车。不知道什么原因，他的马车迟迟未到。司长正和安德雷·菲利波维奇和另外两个高级官员兴趣盎然地谈话。离安德雷·菲利波维奇不远处，安东·安东诺维奇和其他几个职员站着。他们看到司长在优雅地讲笑话，都面带微笑。挤在楼梯上的职员也面带微笑，期待着司长再次开怀大笑。只有一个人没有笑，那就是肥胖的看门人费多谢伊奇。他僵硬地立正站着，握着门把手，焦急地等待着他那份每日快乐——就是以下这个任务：伸出胳膊，把半扇门推开，然后弯腰鞠躬，毕恭毕敬地为司长让路，让其通过。但是，看起来最高兴最得意的是戈利亚德金先生那个一文不值、缺乏教养的敌人。那一刻，他完全忘记了所有职员，甚至没有像往常一样可憎地窜来窜去、来回跳跃。他甚至忘了去巴结任何人。他全神贯注地观察着，聆听着，甚至奇怪地弯起身子。无疑，他竭尽全力去听司长讲话，目不转睛的盯着司长，只偶尔轻轻抽动一下胳膊、腿和头。这一切反映出了他内心的秘密情感。","Saying this, Mr. Golyadkin thrust the letter in his side pocket of his uniform and buttoned up every button of it; then he looked round him, and to his surprise, found that he was by now in the hall of the department in a group of clerks crowding at the outer door, for office hours were over.Mr. Golyadkin had not only failed till that moment to observe this circumstance, but had no notion how he suddenly came to be wearing his greatcoat and goloshes and to be holding his hat in his hand.All the clerks were motionless, in reverential expectation.The fact was that his Excellency was standing at the bottom of the stairs waiting for his carriage, which was for some reason late in arriving, and was carrying on a very interesting conversation with Andrey Filippovitch and two councillors.At a little distance from Andrey Filippovitch stood Anton Antonovitch and several other clerks, who were all smiles, seeing that his Excellency was graciously making a joke.The clerks who were crowded at the top of the stair were smiling too, in expectation of his Excellency’s laughing again.The only one who was not smiling was Fedosyevitch, the corpulent hall-porter, who stood stiffly at attention, holding the handle of the door, waiting impatiently for the daily gratification that fell to his share — that is, the task of flinging one half of the door wide open with a swing of his arm, and then, with a low bow, reverentially making way for his Excellency to pass.But the one who seemed to be more delighted than any and to feel the most satisfaction of all was the worthless and ungentlemanly enemy of Mr. Golyadkin.At that instant he positively forgot all the clerks, and even gave up tripping and pirouetting in his usual odious way; he even forgot to make up to anybody.He was all eyes and ears, he even doubled himself up strangely, no doubt in the strained effort to hear, and never took his eyes off his Excellency, and only from time to time his arms, legs and head twitched with faintly perceptible tremors that betrayed the secret emotions of his soul."
"“啊，瞧他那样子！”我们的主人公心想，“他看起来似乎是个大红人，这个无赖！我倒很想知道他是如何欺骗各个阶层的人们的。他既不聪明，又没道德；既没受过好的教育，又没什么丰富情感。他真是个交了好运的骗子。上帝啊！想想，一个人怎么会如此迅速地到这儿来，和每个人都成为好朋友！他还会继续向上爬的，我敢发誓，这个家伙还会在职场中一帆风顺——他真是个交了好运的无赖！我还想知道，他到底跟大家低语了些什么——他在和这些人密谋什么，他们在讨论什么秘密呀？上帝呀，可怜可怜我们吧！要是我能……和大家也把关系搞好点……比如这个人，那个人，和那一个。我最好不问他，而是要告诉他我不会再那么做了，说‘我错了，大人，现在年轻人总得找个事做。’？我也不会随随便便提出抗议了。我将温顺耐心地忍受这一切。就这样！应该这样吗？……不过，你无法帮助他，这个无赖。你不能用言辞说动他，不能对他晓之以理。不过，我们要努力试试。也许我能时来运转，所以我要试一试……”","“Ah, isn’t he in a state!” thought our hero; “he looks like a favourite, the rascal!I should like to know how it is that he deceives society of every class.He has neither brains nor character, neither education nor feeling; he’s a lucky rogue!Mercy on us!How can a man, when you think of it, come and make friends with every one so quickly!And he’ll get on, I swear the fellow will get on, the rogue will make his way — he’s a lucky rascal!I should like to know, too, what he keeps whispering to every one — what plots he is hatching with all these people, and what secrets they are talking about?Lord, have mercy on us!If only I could ... get on with them a little too ... say this and that and the other.Hadn’t I better ask him ... tell him I won’t do it again; say ‘I’m in fault, and a young man must serve nowadays, your Excellency’?I am not going to protest in any way, either; I shall bear it all with meekness and patience, so there!Is that the way to behave?... Though you’ll never see through him, though, the rascal; you can’t reach him with anything you say; you can’t hammer reason into his head ... We’ll make an effort, though.I may happen to hit on a good moment, so I’ll make an effort...”"
"我们的主人公感到不安、悲痛和困惑，他不能这样半途而废。关键性的时刻已经到来了，他必须找个人好好解释一下。他开始朝着他的那个一文不值、受之有愧的敌人所站的地方移动了一点。但就在这个时刻，司长盼望已久的马车驶进了入口。费多谢伊奇一下拉开门，弯腰躬身，恭送司长出门。所有等候的职员也都涌向大门，一会儿就把老戈利亚德金先生和小戈利亚德金先生分开了。","Feeling in his uneasiness, his misery and his bewilderment that he couldn’t leave things like this, that the critical moment had come, that he must explain himself to some one, our hero began to move a little towards the place where his worthless and undeserving enemy stood: but at that very moment his Excellency’s long-expected carriage rolled up into the entrance, Fedosyevitch flung open the door and, bending double, let his Excellency pass out.All the waiting clerks streamed out towards the door, and for a moment separated Mr. Golyadkin senior from Mr. Golyadkin junior."
"“你跑不掉的！”我们的主人公说，眼睛直直地盯着他想要的那个人，在人群中挤着前进。最后，人群散开了。我们的主人公感觉了自由，便飞一般地去追他的敌人。","“You shan’t get away!” said our hero, forcing his way through the crowd while he kept his eyes fixed upon the man he wanted.At last the crowd dispersed.Our hero felt he was free and flew in pursuit of his enemy."
"第十一章","CHAPTER 11"
"戈利亚德金先生气喘吁吁，像插上了翅膀似的追赶着他那迅速离开的敌人。他感到身上有股巨大的力量。但是，尽管有这股可怕的力量，戈利亚德金先生还是可以确定地认为，现在一只普普通通的蚊子——如果彼得斯堡这个时候还有蚊子的话——可以毫不费力地把他撞倒。他也感觉到他又完全虚弱了，由一种奇怪的外部力量带着往前跑。他不是自己在跑，相反，他的腿根本不听使唤。然而，这一切都可能会好转的。","Mr. Golyadkin’s breath failed him; he flew as though on wings after his rapidly retreating enemy.He was conscious of immense energy.Yet in spite of this terrible energy he might confidently have said that at that moment a humble gnat — had a gnat been able to exist in Petersburg at that time of the year — could very easily have knocked him down.He felt, too, that he was utterly weak again, that he was carried along by a peculiar outside force, that it was not he himself who was running, but, on the contrary, that his legs were giving way under him, and refused to obey him.This all might turn out for the best, however."
"“不管结果是好是坏，”戈利亚德金先生想，他刚才跑得太快，几乎上气不接下气了，“反正这场游戏毫无疑问已经输了。我彻底完蛋了，这是确定无疑、无法更改的。”","“Whether it is for the best or not for the best,” thought Mr. Golyadkin, almost breathless from running so quickly, “but that the game is lost there cannot be the slightest doubt now; that I am utterly done for is certain, definite, signed and ratified.”"
"尽管我们的主人公这么想，但一把拽住他的敌人的大衣时，他感觉似乎死而复生了，似乎一人抵挡了一个军营，似乎赢得了胜利。那时，他的敌人叫了一辆大型马车，正抬脚上车。","In spite of all this our hero felt as though he had risen from the dead, as though he had withstood a battalion, as though he had won a victory when he succeeded in clutching the overcoat of his enemy, who had already raised one foot to get into the cab he had engaged."
"“亲爱的先生！亲爱的先生！”他对着臭名昭著的小戈利亚德金先生大叫，抓着他的衣服扣子，“亲爱的先生，我希望您……”","“My dear sir!“My dear sir! My dear sir!” he shouted to the infamous Mr. Golyadkin junior, holding him by the button.“My dear sir, I hope that you ...”"
"“不，请什么也别希望。”戈利亚德金先生那无情的敌人闪烁其词地回答。他一只脚已经上了马车的台阶，另一只脚则使劲蹬着，想到马车上，却未能如愿。他极力保持平衡，同时也竭尽全力想把衣服从老戈利亚德金先生手中拽出来。然而，老戈利亚德金先生使出了吃奶的劲儿，拽着衣服不放手。","“No, please do not hope for anything,” Mr. Golyadkin’s heartless enemy answered evasively, standing with one foot on the step of the cab and vainly waving the other leg in the air, in his efforts to get in, trying to preserve his equilibrium, and at the same time trying with all his might to wrench his coat away from Mr. Golyadkin senior, while the latter held on to it with all the strength that had been vouchsafed to him by nature."
"“雅科夫·彼得罗维奇，只要十分钟……”","“Yakov Petrovitch, only ten minutes ...”"
"“不好意思，我没有时间……”","“Excuse me, I’ve no time ...”"
"“你必须应允，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇……求求你，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇……看在上帝的份上，雅科夫· 彼得罗维奇……让我们把事说清楚——直截了当……就一秒钟，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇 ……”","“You must admit, Yakov Petrovitch ... please, Yakov Petrovitch ... For God’s sake, Yakov Petrovitch ... let us have it out — in a straightforward way ... one little second, Yakov Petrovitch ...”"
"“亲爱的伙计，我真的不能停留。”戈利亚德金先生无耻的敌人装出善良热情的样子，无礼又亲切地回答道，“下次吧，相信我，我想和你全心全意地交谈。但是，现在我真的不能……”","“My dear fellow, I can’t stay,” answered Mr. Golyadkin’s dishonourable enemy, with uncivil familiarity, disguised as good-natured heartiness; “another time, believe me, with my whole soul and all my heart; but now I really can’t ...”"
"“无赖！”我们的主人公心里想。“雅科夫·彼得罗维奇，”他悲痛地大喊，“我从来都不是你的敌人。一些心怀不轨的人不公正地描述我……我愿意……雅科夫·彼得罗维奇，我们一起进去坐坐怎么样，现在就去，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇？我真心想，就如同你刚才公正的言辞一样，用直截了当的方式和高尚的语言，就如同你刚才所说的那样——我们去这家咖啡馆坐坐。这样，事实就会真相大白。事情会清楚的，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇。那时，所有的事情都肯定会真相大白……”","“Scoundrel!” thought our hero.“Yakov Petrovitch,” he cried miserably.“I have never been your enemy.Spiteful people have described me unjustly ... I am ready, on my side ... Yakov Petrovitch, shall we go in here together, at once, Yakov Petrovitch?And with all my heart, as you have so justly expressed it just now, and in straightforward, honourable language, as you have expressed it just now — here into this coffee-house; there the facts will explain themselves: they will really, Yakov Petrovitch.Then everything will certainly explain itself ...”"
"“去咖啡馆？好呀。我不反对。我们去咖啡馆有一个条件，亲爱的朋友，有一个条件——把一切事情都澄清。我们要把事情弄清楚，亲爱的。”小戈利亚德金先生说，从马车里下来，不知羞耻地拍了拍我们的主人公的肩膀，“你真是我贴心的好朋友。看在你的面子上，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇，我情愿走偏僻的后街（正如有一次你发表的真知灼见一样，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇）。天啊，他真是个无赖！相信我，他对付无赖是小菜一碟！”戈利亚德金先生的假朋友继续说，微笑着奉承他，哄骗他。两位戈利亚德金先生所去的咖啡馆离大街有一段距离。此时，咖啡馆里没有什么顾客。一位矮胖结实的德国女人出现在柜台后面。戈利亚德金先生和他卑鄙无耻的敌人走进了第二个房间。一个看起来浮肿、头发很短的小男孩正在那儿忙着生火。他拿一把干粪块，蹲在炉边，使劲想把闷燃着的炉火生旺。小戈利亚德金先生点了巧克力。","“Into the coffee-house?Very good.I am not against it.Let us go into the coffee-house on one condition only, my dear, on one condition — that these things shall be cleared up. We will have it out, darling,” said Mr. Golyadkin junior, getting out of the cab and shamelessly slapping our hero on the shoulder; “You friend of my heart, for your sake, Yakov Petrovitch, I am ready to go by the back street (as you were pleased to observe so aptly on one occasion, Yakov Petrovitch).Why, what a rogue he is!Upon my word, he does just what he likes with one!”Mr. Golyadkin’s false friend went on, fawning upon him and cajoling him with a little smile.The coffee-house which the two Mr. Golyadkins entered stood some distance away from the main street and was at the moment quite empty.A rather stout German woman made her appearance behind the counter.Mr. Golyadkin and his unworthy enemy went into the second room, where a puffy-looking boy with a closely shaven head was busy with a bundle of chips at the stove, trying to revive the smouldering fire.At Mr. Golyadkin junior’s request chocolate was served."
"“可爱的小娘们呀。”小戈利亚德金先生一边说，一边狡黠地向老戈利亚德金先生眨了眨眼。","“And a sweet little lady-tart,” said Mr. Golyadkin junior, with a sly wink at Mr. Golyadkin senior."
"我们的主人公涨红了脸，没有说什么。","Our hero blushed and was silent."
"“哦，我忘了，对不起。我知道你的口味。先生，咱们喜欢性感的德国小娘们。你和我都喜欢性感可人的德国小娘们。你这个正直的人，你说我们是不是这样？我们住在她们家，诱惑她们发善心。她们用啤酒汤和牛奶汤俘获我们的心，我们报以各种字据。我们就是这样做，你这个福布拉斯，你真是个骗子！”小戈利亚德金先生说这番话，是在卑鄙恶毒但又巧妙地暗指某位女士。他对我们的主人公献装殷，脸上带着和蔼可亲的笑容，假装显得和他会面很开心，很高兴。看到老戈利亚德金先生还没有那么愚蠢，缺乏教养和上流社会人士的风度，所以没有相信他，这个声名狼藉的家伙决定变换策略，对他进行更直接的攻击。假戈利亚德金先生发表完令人恶心的演说之后，拍了拍实实在在的真戈利亚德金先生的肩膀，其厚颜无耻和故作亲密令人作恶。他对此还不满足，开始开起了玩笑，这玩笑与教养良好的上流社会人士完全不相称。他想起了重新玩讨厌的老把戏这个主意——无视老戈利亚德金先生的反抗和出于愤怒而发出的虚弱喊叫，伸出手来拧他的脸。看到这样的邪恶行为，我们的主人公内心沸腾，但表面依旧平静……但是，这只是暂时的。","“Oh, yes, I forgot, I beg your pardon. I know your tast. I know your taste.We are sweet on charming little Germans, sir; you and I are sweet on charming and agreeable little Germans, aren’t we, you upright soul?We take their lodgings, we seduce their morals, they win our hearts with their beersoup and their milksoup, and we give them notes of different sorts, that’s what we do, you Faublas, you deceiver!”All this Mr. Golyadkin junior said, making an unworthy though villainously artful allusion to a certain personage of the female sex, while he fawned upon our hero, smiled at him with an amiable air, with a deceitful show of being delighted with him and pleased to have met him.Seeing that Mr. Golyadkin senior was by no means so stupid and deficient in breeding and the manners of good society as to believe in him, the infamous man resolved to change his tactics and to make a more open attack upon him.After uttering his disgusting speech, the false Mr. Golyadkin ended by slapping the real and substantial Mr. Golyadkin on the shoulder, with a revolting effrontery and familiarity.Not content with that, he began playing pranks utterly unfit for well-bred society; he took it into his head to repeat his old, nauseous trick — that is, regardless of the resistance and faint cries of the indignant Mr. Golyadkin senior, he pinched the latter on the cheek.At the spectacle of such depravity our hero boiled within, but was silent ... only for the time, however."
"“这是我的敌人说的话。”老戈利亚德金先生最后用颤抖的声音回答说，谨慎地克制自己。与此同时，我们的主人公不安地朝门口看去。事实上，小戈利亚德金先生似乎兴致很高，准备说各种各样的小笑话。这些笑话总体来说，不宜在公共场所讲出，不符合礼仪规范，特别是在教养良好的上流社会里。","“That is the talk of my enemies,” he answered at last, in a trembling voice, prudently restraining himself.At the same time our hero looked round uneasily towards the door.The fact was that Mr. Golyadkin junior seemed in excellent spirits, and ready for all sorts of little jokes, unseemly in a public place, and, speaking generally, not permissible by the laws of good manners, especially in well-bred society."
"“噢，那么，即然这样，随便你了。”小戈利亚德金先生严肃地回应了老戈利亚德金先生的想法，很不雅观地大口喝光了茶，把空杯子放在桌子上，“嗯，我也没必要和你多谈，不过……?你现在过得怎么样，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇？”","“Oh, well, in that case, as you please,” Mr. Golyadkin junior gravely responded to our hero’s thought, setting down upon the table the empty cup which he had gulped down with unseemly greed.“Well, there’s no need for me to stay long with you, however...Well, how are you getting on now, Yakov Petrovitch?”"
"“我只能告诉你一件事情，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇，”我们的主人公回答说，极其镇定且带有尊严，“我从来都不是你的敌人。”","“There’s only one thing I can tell you, Yakov Petrovitch,” our hero answered, with sangfroid and dignity; “I’ve never been your enemy.”"
"“呃……噢，彼得鲁什卡怎么样？我想，他是叫彼得鲁什卡吧？对的，是叫彼得鲁什卡！那么，他怎么样？好吗？还和以前一样吗？”","“H’m ... Oh, what about Petrushka?Petrushka is his name, I fancy?Yes, it is Petrushka!Well, how is he?Well?The same as ever?”"
"“他还和以前一样，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇。”老戈利亚德金先生回答，感觉有点惊讶，“我不知道，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇……从我的立场来看……坦诚、高尚地看待这件事，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇，你必须承认，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇……”","“He’s the same as ever, too, Yakov Petrovitch,” answered Mr. Golyadkin senior, somewhat amazed.“I don’t know, Yakov Petrovitch ... from my standpoint ... from a candid, honourable standpoint, Yakov Petrovitch, you must admit, Yakov Petrovitch...”"
"“是呀，但你自己也知道，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇，”小戈利亚德金先生回答道，声音温柔而富有表现力。他虚伪地把自己装扮成一个内心悲痛、懊悔万分、值得同情的家伙。“你自己也知道，我们生活在一个艰难的时代……我佩服你，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇。你是个聪慧的人，想法都很公正。”小戈利亚德金先生总结性地说，卑鄙地奉承老戈利亚德金先生，“生活不是游戏，你自己也清楚，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇。”小戈利亚德金先生意味深长地加了一句，装成一个聪明且博学的人，那种能对高尚的话题作出判断的人。","“Yes, but you know yourself, Yakov Petrovitch,” Mr. Golyadkin junior answered in a soft and expressive voice, so posing falsely as a sorrowful man overcome with remorse and deserving compassion.“You know yourself as we live in difficult time ... I appeal to you, Yakov Petrovitch; you are an intelligent man and your reflections are just,” Mr. Golyadkin junior said in conclusion, flattering Mr. Golyadkin senior in an abject way.“Life is not a game, you know yourself, Yakov Petrovitch,” Mr. Golyadkin junior added, with vast significance, assuming the character of a clever and learned man, who is capable of passing judgements on lofty subjects."
"“对我而言，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇，”我们的主人公热情地回答说，“对我而言，我讨厌绕弯子，喜欢坦率大胆地说话，用直率高尚的语言，在整个事情中不失高尚。告诉你吧，我敢公开骄傲地肯定，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇，我完全是清白的，而且，你自己也清楚，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇，错误是双方的——这可能全是社会的判断，是那些人云亦云的人群的观点……我公开地说，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇，所有事情都是有可能的。我还要说，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇，如果你这样来看问题，如果你从高尚、高贵的角度来看这个问题，那么我要大胆、不假装羞耻地说，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇，如果我发现我错了，我一定会对这个发现很高兴，非常乐意承认错误。你知道你是个聪明人，而且，你还是个绅士。我愿意毫不羞耻地，也不假装羞耻地承认这一点。”我们的主人公最后高尚而有尊严地说。","“For my part, Yakov Petrovitch,” our hero answered warmly, “for my part, scorning to be roundabout and speaking boldly and openly, using straightforward, honourable language and putting the whole matter on an honourable basis, I tell you I can openly and honourably assert, Yakov Petrovitch, that I am absolutely pure, and that, you know it yourself, Yakov Petrovitch, the error is mutual — it may all be the world’s judgment, the opinion of the slavish crowd...I speak openly, Yakov Petrovitch, everything is possible.I will say, too, Yakov Petrovitch, if you judge it in this way, if you look at the matter from a lofty, noble point of view, then I will boldly say, without false shame I will say, Yakov Petrovitch, it will positively be a pleasure to me to discover that I have been in error, it will positively be a pleasure to me to recognize it.You know yourself you are an intelligent man and, what is more, you are a gentleman.Without shame, without false shame, I am ready to recognize it,” he wound up with dignity and nobility."
"“这都是命呀，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇……但我们先不说这些。”小戈利亚德金先生说，“让我们利用这短暂的见面时间聊聊更愉悦有益的事，这才是适合两个同事聊的话题……真的，这段时间，我都还没和你说几句话……这也不能怪我呀，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇……”","“It is the decree of destiny, Yakov Petrovitch ... but let us drop all this,” said Mr. Golyadkin junior.“Let us rather use the brief moment of our meeting for a more pleasant and profitable conversation, as is only suitable between two colleagues in the service ... Really, I have not succeeded in saying two words to you all this time...I am not to blame for that, Yakov Petrovitch...”"
"“也不能怪我。”我们的主人公热情地回答，“也不能怪我！我的心告诉我，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇，这件事不能怪我。我们只能怪命了，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇。”老戈利亚德金先生很快地用安慰的口吻说。他的声音一点一点变得柔弱而颤抖。","“Nor I,” answered our hero warmly, “nor I, either!My heart tells me, Yakov Petrovitch, that I’m not to blame in all this matter.Let us blame fate for all this, Yakov Petrovitch,” added Mr. Golyadkin senior, in a quick, conciliatory tone of voice.His voice began little by little to soften and to quaver."
"“好啦！你身体如何？”这个罪人甜甜地说。","“Well!“Well! How are you in health?” said the sinner in a sweet voice."
"“我有一点咳嗽。”我们的主人公回答，语气比对方更为甜蜜。","“I have a little cough,” answered our hero, even more sweetly."
"“照顾好你自己。现在，疾病多发，很容易染上扁桃腺炎。坦白说，我都穿上法兰绒了。”","“Take care of yourself.There is so much illness going about, you may easily get quinsy; for my part I confess I’ve begun to wrap myself up in flannel.”"
"“真的是这样，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇，人很容易染上扁桃腺炎。”我们的主人公沉默了片刻后说，“雅科夫·彼得罗维奇，我明白我搞错了，我想起咱们俩有幸共同度过的美好时光，感觉很温暖。我冒昧说，我的舍下虽然贫寒，但却很热情好客……”","“One may, indeed, Yakov Petrovitch, very easily get quinsy,” our hero pronounced after a brief silence; “Yakov Petrovitch, I see that I have made a mistake, I remember with softened feelings those happy moments which we were so fortunate as to spend together, under my poor, though I venture to say, hospitable roof ...”"
"“可是，你在信中却不是这么写的。”小戈利亚德金先生带着责备的语气说。说起这件事——也就在这件事上——他是非常公正的。","“In your letter, however, you wrote something very different,” said Mr. Golyadkin junior reproachfully, speaking on this occasion — though only on this occasion — quite justly."
"“雅科夫·彼得罗维奇，我错了……现在，我清楚地明白了我那封愤怒的信真是个错误。雅科夫·彼得罗维奇，我看见你都觉得羞愧，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇，你一定不会相信……你把那封信还给我，我会在你面前把它撕成碎片。雅科夫·彼得罗维奇，如果完全无法那样做的话，我请求你从相反的角度读这封信——按照和之前完全相反的意思来读——也就是说，带着友好的态度，把我信中所有的话都赋予相反的意义。我错了。原谅我，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇。我真的……我可怜地弄错了，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇。”","“Yakov Petrovitch, I was in error...I see clearly now that I was in error in my unhappy letter too.Yakov Petrovitch, I am ashamed to look at you, Yakov Petrovitch, you wouldn’t believe ... Give me that letter that I may tear it to pieces before your eyes, Yakov Petrovitch, and if that is utterly impossible I entreat you to read it the other way before — precisely the other way before — that is, expressly with a friendly intention, giving the opposite sense to the whole letter.I was in error.Forgive me, Yakov Petrovitch, I was quite ... I was grievously in error, Yakov Petrovitch.”"
"“你真这么想？”戈利亚德金先生背信弃义的朋友问道，相当随意和冷漠。","“You say so?”Mr. Golyadkin’s perfidious friend inquired, rather casually and indifferently."
"“我说我完全搞错了。雅科夫·彼得罗维奇，我，我没有假装羞耻，我……”","“I say that I was quite in error, Yakov Petrovitch, and that for my part, quite without false shame, I am ...”"
"“啊，好，没关系的！你错得好。”小戈利亚德金先生说。","“Ah, well, that’s all right!That’s a nice thing your being in error,” answered Mr. Golyadkin junior."
"“我甚至曾有个想法，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇，”我们坦诚的主人公绅士地回答说，一点儿也没发现他骗人的敌人那可怕的背叛，“我甚至曾经想，上帝创造了我们两个完全相同的人……”","“I even had an idea, Yakov Petrovitch,” our candid hero answered in a gentlemanly way, completely failing to observe the horrible perfidy of his deceitful enemy; “I even had an idea that here were two people created exactly alike...”"
"“啊，这就是你的想法呀？”","“Ah, is that your idea?”"
"这时，因无耻而臭名昭著的戈利亚德金先生拿起了他的帽子。老戈利亚德金先生仍旧没有发现他的背叛，也跟着他站起身。老戈利亚德金先生对他的假朋友露出高尚纯真的微笑，天真地竭力对他表示友好，鼓励他，想用这种方式和他建立新的友谊。","At this point the notoriously worthless Mr. Golyadkin took up his hat.Still failing to observe his treachery, Mr. Golyadkin senior, too, got up and with a noble, simple-hearted smile to his false friend, tried in his innocence to be friendly to him , to encourage him, and in that way to form a new friendship with him."
"“再见，大人。”小戈利亚德金先生突然叫道。我们的主人公吃了一惊，注意到敌人的脸上分明带着醉酒后的狂态，完全是为了摆脱他。他把两个手指伸进这个无原则的人伸开的手中。但是……但是，就在这时，他的不知羞耻的敌人抓住了他的手。抓住戈利亚德金先生的两根手指后，他先是使劲握紧。就在戈利亚德金先生眼前，这个无耻的家伙又当场厚颜无耻地玩起了上午那个可耻的玩笑。人的忍耐是有限度的。","“Good-bye, your Excellency,” Mr. Golyadkin junior called out suddenly.Our hero started, noticing in his enemy’s face something positively Bacchanalian, and, solely to get rid of him, put two fingers into the unprincipled man’s outstretched hand; but then ... then his enemy’s shameless ness passed all bounds.Seizing the two fingers of Mr. Golyadkin’s hand and at first pressing them, the worthless fellow on the spot, before Mr. Golyadkin’s eyes, had the effrontery to repeat the shameful joke of the morning.The limit of human patience was exhausted."
"老戈利亚德金先生从惊愕中恢复过来，拔腿向隔壁房间追时，这个与他有不共戴天之仇的敌人已经逃到隔壁房间，像往常一样迅速，并把擦完手指的手帕藏进了口袋。他好像完全清白无辜似的，站在柜台边吃着馅饼，没有脸红心跳，像个正人君子似的，礼貌地和柜台后的德国女人谈话。","He had just hidden in his pocket the handkerchief with which he had wiped his fingers when Mr. Golyadkin senior recovered from the shock and dashed after him into the next room, into which his irreconcilable foe had in his usual hasty way hastened to decamp.As though perfectly innocent, he was standing at the counter eating pies, and with perfect composure, like a virtuous man, was making polite remarks to the German woman behind the counter."
"“我不能当着女士的面解决这件事。”我们的主人公想，也走到柜台前，激动地几乎不知道自己在做什么。","“I can’t go into it before ladies,” thought our hero, and he, too, went up to the counter, so agitated that he hardly knew what he was doing."
"“这娘们长得不错！你觉得呢？”小戈利亚德金先生又开始说他那些不得体的俏皮话。他无疑是认为老戈利亚德金先生会无限度地忍让。那个矮胖的德国女人显然听不懂俄语，用空洞的蓝灰色的眼睛看着两位顾客，殷勤地笑着。听了不知羞耻的小戈利亚德金先生的话，我们的主人公脸羞得通红，无法控制自己的情绪，冲到他面前，显出一副要把他撕成碎片的样子，彻底把他打垮。但是，小戈利亚德金先生依照他往常卑鄙的习惯，已经溜远了。他逃跑了，早已站在了台阶上。几乎不用说，老戈利亚德金先生自然愣了一下，醒悟过来后全速追赶他那损人的敌人。而敌人已经坐上了马车，而且，马车夫显然是他的同谋。但是，就在这个时候， 那个矮胖的德国女人看到两个顾客都往外跑，尖叫起来，使出全力摇响了铃。我们的主人公正在急速飞奔，但他还是转过身来，把钱扔给了她，替自己和那个没有付账就离开的无耻家伙付了钱，零钱也没要。虽然这使我们的主人公耽搁了一会儿，他还是抓住了他的敌人。他使出全身的力气，挂在马车的侧面，就这样被拖着沿街走了一会儿。他往马车上爬，尽管小戈利亚德金先生一直不遗余力要把他推下去。此时，马车夫正拿着鞭子，拉着缰绳，又踢又喊地催赶着他那已经疲惫的老马。突然，马咬住马嚼子，可怕地蹬着后腿，飞奔起来。最后，我们的主人公爬上了马车，背对着马车夫。他的膝盖抵着敌人的膝盖，右手抓着这个道德丧失且愤怒抓狂的敌人的衣领，敌人穿着一件破旧的皮毛外套。","“The tart is certainly not bad!What do you think?”Mr. Golyadkin junior began upon his unseemly sallies again, reckoning, no doubt, upon Mr. Golyadkin’s infinite patience.The stout German, for her part, looked at both her visitors with pewtery, vacant-looking eyes, smiling affably and evidently not understanding Russian.Our hero flushed red as fire at the words of the unabashed Mr. Golyadkin junior, and, unable to control himself, rushed at him with the evident intention of tearing him to pieces and finishing him off completely, but Mr. Golyadkin junior, in his usual mean way, was already far off; he took flight, he was already on the steps.It need hardly be said that, after the first moment of stupefaction with which Mr. Golyadkin senior was naturally overcome, he recovered himself and went at full speed after his insulting enemy, who had already got into a cab, whose driver was obviously in collusion with him.But at that very instant the stout German, seeing both her customers make off, shrieked and rang her bell with all her might.Our hero was on the point of flight, but he turned back, and, without asking for change, flung her money for himself and for the shameless man who had left without paying, and although thus delayed he succeeded in catching up his enemy.Hanging on to the side of the cab with all the force bestowed on him by nature, our hero was carried for some time along the street, clambering upon the vehicle, while Mr. Golyadkin junior did his utmost to dislodge him.Meanwhile the cabman, with whip, with reins, with kicks and with shouts urged on his exhausted nag, who quite unexpectedly dropped into a gallop, biting at the bit, and kicking with his hind legs in a horrid way.At last our enemy and with his back to the driver, his knees touching the knees and his right hand clutching the very shabby fur collar of his depraved and exasperated foe."
"这对敌人坐在马车上沉默了一会儿。我们的主人公几乎喘不过气来。路很糟糕。马车每走一步，他都会被颠起来，冒着脖子被折断的危险。此外，他那恼羞成怒的敌人还不肯认输，使劲想要把他推到泥坑里去。除了他身处的这些不愉快外，天气也很恶劣。大片大片的雪花纷纷落下，好像使劲要钻到真戈利亚德金先生那敞开的大衣里面。大雾弥漫，什么都看不见。很难辨清马车在驶向什么方向，走的是哪条街……戈利亚德金先生觉得，正在发生的事不知为何有种熟悉的感觉。有一刻，他竭力回忆自己是不是前一天就有了预感，比如，在梦中……","The enemies were borne along for some time in silence.Our hero could scarcely breathe.It was a bad road and he was jolted at every step and in peril of breaking his neck.Moreover, his exasperated foe still refused to acknowledge himself vanquished and was trying to shove him off into the mud.To complete the unpleasantness of his position the weather was detestable.The snow was falling in heavy flakes and doing its utmost to creep under the unfastened overcoat of the genuine Mr. Golyadkin.It was foggy and nothing could be seen.It was difficult to tell through what street and in what direction they were being taken ... It seemed to Mr. Golyadkin that what was happening to him was somehow familiar.One instant he tried to remember whether he had had a presentiment of it the day before, in a dream, for instance..."
"最后，他的烦恼上升到了极度的悲痛。他倒向他那残忍的敌人身上，开始大叫。但是，他没有喊出来……有一会儿，戈利亚德金先生忘记了一切，认定这一切都没有意义，不值一提。他认为这件事的发生很莫名其妙，因此反抗也是白费功夫……但是，突然，也就是在我们的主人公得出这个结论的瞬间，马车突然一颠，事情就有了一个新的局面。戈利亚德金先生从马车上像一袋面粉那样摔了下来，在地上滚了几圈。他落下的时候，清醒地意识到他的激动太不合时宜了。最后，他跳起来，看到他们到了某个地方。马车就停在某个院子的中间。我们的主人公一眼就认出这是奥尔苏菲·伊万诺维奇居住的公寓所在的院子。就在那一刻，戈利亚德金先生也看到他的敌人正登上台阶，很可能是要去找奥尔苏菲·伊万诺维奇。他感到无法言喻的痛苦，正想去追赶他的敌人，但是，幸运的是，他谨慎地改变了注意。戈利亚德金先生没有忘记付钱给马车夫。之后，他全力沿街奔跑，毫无目的。雪还像刚才那样飘落，天还像刚才那样大雾弥漫、潮湿、昏暗。我们的主人公不是在走，而是在飞，与路上的每一个人碰撞着——男人，女人和孩子。他听到身边和身后传来一阵惊吓声、尖叫声和喊叫声……但是，戈利亚德金先生似乎没有意识了，完全不予理会……他恢复意识时，已经到了谢苗诺夫桥。他撞到两个农妇，还把她们正在卖的商品撞得满地都是，惹得两位农妇很不高兴。他自己也摔倒在了这些商品上。也就这样，他才恢复了意识。","At last his wretchedness reached the utmost pitch of agony.Leaning upon his merciless opponent, he was beginning to cry out.But his cries died away upon his lips...There was a moment when Mr. Golyadkin forgot everything, and made up his mind that all this was of no consequence and that it was all nothing, that it was happening in some inexplicable manner, and that, therefore, to protest was effort thrown away...But suddenly and almost at the same instant that our hero was drawing this conclusion, an unexpected jolt gave quite a new turn to the affair.Mr. Golyadkin fell off the cab like a sack of flour and rolled on the ground, quite correctly recognizing, at the moment of his fall, that his excitement had been very inappropriate.Jumping up at last, he saw that they had arrived somewhere; the cab was standing in the middle of some courtyard, and from the first glance our hero noticed that it was the courtyard of the house in which was Olsufy Ivanovitch’s flat.At the same instant he noticed that his enemy was mounting the steps, probably on his way to Olsufy Ivanovitch’s.In indescribable misery he was about to pursue his enemy, but, fortunately for himself, prudently thought better of it.Not forgetting to pay the cabman, Mr. Golyadkin ran with all his might along the street, regardless of where he was going.The snow was falling heavily as before; as before it was muggy, wet, and dark.Our hero did not walk, but flew, coming into collision with every one on the way — men, women and children.About him and after him he heard frightened voices, squeals, screams ... But Mr. Golyadkin seemed unconscious and would pay no heed to anything...He came to himself, however, on Semyonovsky Bridge, and then only through succeeding in tripping against and upsetting two peasant women and the wares they were selling, and tumbling over them."
"“这没什么。”戈利亚德金先生心想，“很容易补救。”于是，他立即把手伸进口袋，想用一卢布来赔偿他打翻在地的蛋糕、苹果、坚果，以及各种各样的小玩意儿。突然，一道新光闪过戈利亚德金先生的脑海。他在口袋里摸到了职员早上写给他的那封信。他想起不远处有个小酒馆，于是立即跑到那家酒馆，坐在一张被动物油脂蜡烛照亮的桌子前。他不理会服务员过来要他点菜，忽视了周围的一切，拆开信封，开始读信。信的内容使他大吃一惊：","“That’s no matter,” thought Mr. Golyadkin, “that can easily be set right,” and felt in his pocket at once, intending to make up for the cakes, apples, nuts and various trifles he had scattered with a rouble.Suddenly a new light dawned upon Mr. Golyadkin; in his pocket he felt the letter given him in the morning by the clerk.Remembering that there was a tavern he knew close by, he ran to it without a moment’s delay, settled himself at a little table lighted up by a tallow candle, and, taking no notice of anything, regardless of the waiter who came to ask for his orders, broke the seal and began reading the following letter, which completely astounded him —"
"“正为我受苦的高尚的人呀，我永远真心爱戴的人呀！","“You noble man, who are suffering for my sake, and will be dear to my heart for ever!"
"“我正在经受折磨，我正在消亡——快来救我！那个造谣中伤者，那个诡计多端的家伙，那个道德沦丧而臭名昭著的家伙，他把我卷入了这个陷阱。我完蛋了！我陷入了其中！但是，我讨厌他，而你！……他们将我俩拆开，他们拦截了我给你的信。这一切都是因为那个邪恶的人利用了他的一个优点——他和你的相像。一个人可以其貌不扬，但是他能利用他的智慧、强烈的感情和优雅的举止让人醉心……我完蛋了！我被迫违背意愿出嫁了，这个阴谋的主使人是我的父亲，我的恩人，市政官员奥尔苏菲·伊万诺维奇。毫无疑问，他想让我在上流社会建立地位和人际关系……但是，我已下定决心，我要用上天赋予我的所有力量反抗。请在今天晚上九点钟备好马车，在奥尔苏菲·伊万诺维奇家公寓的窗户下等我。我们家又要举行舞会了，有一个帅气的陆军中尉要来。我到时会出来，然后我们一起远走高飞。而且，你也可以另谋差事为国家效劳。无论如何，你要记住，我的朋友，清白之所以强大就是因为它的无辜。再见。备一辆马车，在门口等我。午夜两点，我会投入你的怀抱寻求保护。","“I am suffering, I am perishing — save me!The slanderer, the intriguer, notorious for the immorality of his tendencies, has entangled me in his snares and I am undone!I am lost!But he is abhorrent to me, while you!... They have separated us, they have intercepted my letters to you — and all this has been the vicious man who has taken advantage of his one good quality — his likeness to you.A man can always be plain in appearance, yet fascinate by his intelligence, his strong feelings and his agreeable manners ... I am ruined!I am being married against my will, and the chief part in this intrigue is taken by my parent, benefactor and civil councillor, Olsufy Ivanovitch, no doubt desirous of securing me a place and relations in well-bred society...But I have made up my mind and I protest by all the powers bestowed on me by nature.Be waiting for me with a carriage at nine o’clock this evening at the window of Olsufy Ivanovitch’s flat.We are having another ball and a handsome lieutenant is coming.I will come out and we will fly.Moreover, there are other government offices in which one can be of service to one’s country.In any case, remember, my friend, that innocence is strong in its very innocence.Farewell.Wait with the carriage at the entrance.I shall throw myself into the protection of your arms at two o’clock in the night."
"“至死都是你的人","“Yours till death,"
"“克拉拉·奥尔苏菲耶夫娜”","“Klara Olsufyevna.”"
"读完这封信，我们的主人公呆坐了几分钟。他心烦意乱、烦躁不安、面白如纸，手里拿着信，在房间里踱了几个来回。除了他处境的尴尬，此刻他还成了这个屋子所有人注视的焦点，而他却没有注意到。他双手打着的手势，以及无意中信口说的一些高深莫测的话，这一切都让顾客对他产生了一种偏见，甚至服务员也开始怀疑地看着他。平静了一下，戈利亚德金先生注意到他正站在房间正中间，正用一种几乎很不得体、很不礼貌的仪态盯着一位外表极其可敬的老者。这位老人吃过了饭，在神像前祷告过之后，又坐了下来，盯着戈利亚德金先生看。我们的主人公浑浑噩噩地看了看他周围，发现所有人，真的是所有人，都带着敌意和怀疑的神情看着他。突然，一个红衣领的退伍军人大声索要《警察局新闻》。戈利亚德金先生惊了一下，脸红了：他无意中低头看见自己衣着混乱，甚至在家里也不会穿成这样，更不用说在公共场所了。他的靴子、裤子和整个左半身都沾上了泥巴。右腿上的套袋也断了，上衣甚至还划破了很多处。我们的主人公极其痛苦地走到他看信的桌子旁，看到一名服务员正向他走来，表情奇怪而飞扬跋扈，丝毫没有礼貌可言。他非常不悦，心情很是沮丧，开始站在桌子边，扫视着桌子。桌子上放着一个脏盘子，是有人用过餐后留下的，还有一块餐巾、一把刀叉和一个汤勺，都有人用过。“是谁在这儿用餐了呢？”我们的主人公心想，“难道是我？一切都是可能的！我一定是吃过了饭，自己没有发觉。我接下来要干什么？”","After reading the letter our hero remained for some minutes as though petrified.In terrible anxiety, in terrible agitation, white as a sheet, with the letter in his hand, he walked several times up and down the room; to complete the unpleasantness of his position, though our hero failed to observe it, he was at that moment the object of the exclusive attention of every one in the room, his gesticulating with both hands, perhaps some enigmatic words unconsciously addressed to the air, probably all this prejudiced Mr. Golyadkin in the opinion of the customers, and even the waiter began to look at him suspiciously.Coming to himself, Mr. Golyadkin noticed that he was standing in the middle of the room and was in an almost unseemly, discourteous manner staring at an old man of very respectable appearance who, having dined and said grace before the ikon, had sat down again and fixed his eyes upon Mr. Golyadkin.Our hero looked vaguely about him and noticed that every one, actually every one, was looking at him with a hostile and suspicious air.All at once a retired military man in a red collar asked loudly for the Police News.Mr. Golyadkin started and turned crimson: he happened to look down and saw that he was in such disorderly attire as he would not have worn even at home, much less in a public place.His boots, his trousers and the whole of his left side were covered with mud; the trouser-strap was torn off his right foot, and his coat was even torn in many places.In extreme misery our hero went up to the table at which he had read the letter, ad saw that the attendant was coming up to him with a strange and impudently peremptory expression of face.utterly disconcerted and crestfallen, our hero began to look about the table at which he was now standing.On the table stood a dirt plate, left there from somebody’s dinner, a soled table-napkin and a knife, fork and spoon that had just been used.“Who has been having dinner?” thought our hero.“Can it have been I?Anything is possible!I must have had dinner without noticing it; what am I to do?”"
"戈利亚德金先生抬眼又看见了那个服务员。这个服务员似乎有话要对他说。","Raising his eyes, Mr. Golyadkin again saw beside him the waiter who was about to address him."
"“伙计，结账，多少钱？”我们的主人公问，声音有些颤抖。","“How much is my bill, my lad?” our hero inquired, in a trembling voice."
"戈利亚德金先生周围响起一阵大笑声，服务员自己也咧嘴笑了。戈利亚德金先生意识到他又搞错了，做了件愚蠢无比的事情。他在这片混乱中不知所措，为了避免站在那儿无所事事的尴尬，他把手伸进口袋去拿手帕。但是，令他自己和周围的人都觉得完全不可思议的是，他掏出来的不是手帕，而是四天前克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇开给他的一瓶药。“在同一家药房买药。”戈利亚德金先生脑子里闪过这句话……","A loud laugh sounded round Mr. Golyadkin, the waiter himself grinned.Mr. Golyadkin realized that he had blundered again, and had done something dreadfully stupid.He was overcome by confusion, and to avoid standing there with nothing to do he put his hand in his pocket to get out his handkerchief; but to the indescribable amazement of himself and all surrounding him, he pulled out instead of his handkerchief the bottle of medicine which Krestyan Ivanovitch had prescribed for him four days earlier.“Get the medicine at the same chemist’s,” floated through Mr. Golyadkin’s brain..."
"他突然打了个哆嗦，吓得差点叫出来。一道新光闪过……令人恶心的暗红色液体在戈利亚德金先生的眼睛里闪过一丝不祥的光。瓶子从他手里滑落，摔得粉碎。我们的主人公大叫一声，往后退了一步，躲开飞溅的药水……他浑身发抖，汗珠从额头和鬓角渗出。“我有生命危险。”这时，房间里出现了一阵骚动和混乱。大家都围着戈利亚德金先生，与他讲话，有些人甚至抓住他。但是，我们的主人公麻木地愣在那里，一动不动，什么也看不见，什么也听不见，什么也感觉不到……最后，他像是要逃离这个地方一样，冲出酒馆，把众人，尤其是试图拦住他的人推到一边。他几乎是下意识地坐上路过的第一辆马车，往家里奔去。","Suddenly he started and almost cried out in horror.A new light dawned...The dark reddish and repulsive liquid had a sinister gleam to Mr. Golyadkin’s eyes...The bottle dropped from his hands and was instantly smashed.Our hero cried out and stepped back a pace to avoid the spilled medicine ... he was trembling in every limb, and drops of sweat came out on to his brow and temples.“So my life is in danger!”Meantime there was a stir, a commotion in the room; every one surrounded Mr. Golyadkin, every one talked to Mr. Golyadkin, some even caught hold of Mr. Golyadkin.But our hero was dumb and motionless, seeing nothing, hearing nothing, feeling nothing...At last, as though tearing himself from the place, he rushed out of the tavern, pushing away all and each who tried to detain him; almost unconscious, he got into the first cab that passed him and drove to his flat."
"戈利亚德金先生在寓所的门口遇见了米赫耶夫。他是司里的侍者，手里拿着一份官署的信。","In the entry of his flat he met Mihyeev, an attendant from the office, with an official envelope in his hand."
"“我知道了，大好人，我全知道了。”我们的主人公回答道，他已经筋疲力竭了，声音虚弱而悲惨，“这是官方……”","“I know, my good man, I know all about it,” our exhausted hero answered, in a weak, miserable voice; “it’s official ...”"
"信封里果然是一份给戈利亚德金先生的书面通知，由安德雷·菲利波维奇签署，命令他结束手头的工作，移交给伊万·谢苗诺维奇。戈利亚德金先生拿着信封，给了送信人十个戈比，走进了自己的公寓。他看见彼得鲁什卡正在收拾自己的零碎物品，所有东西堆成一堆，显然是打算遗弃戈利亚德金先生，搬到引诱他过去以替代耶夫斯塔菲职位的卡罗利娜·伊万诺维奇那儿去。","The envelope did, in fact, contain instructions to Mr. Golyadkin, signed by Andrey Filippovitch, to give up the business in his hands to Ivan Semyonovitch.Taking the envelope and giving ten kopecks to the man, Mr. Golyadkin went into his flat and saw that Petrushka was collecting all his odds and ends, all his things into a heap, evidently intending to abandon Mr. Golyadkin and move to the flat of Karolina Ivanovna, who had enticed him to take the place of Yevstafy."
"第十二章","CHAPTER 12"
"彼得鲁什卡大摇大摆地走了进来，举止放肆得奇怪，脸上带着一种小人得志的神情。显然，他脑袋里在盘算着什么，而且感觉自己完全有资格这么做。他看起来像个局外人似的——也就是说，好像他是别人的佣人而不是戈利亚德金先生的佣人一样。","Petrushka came in swaggering, with a strangely casual manner and an air of vulgar triumph on his face.It was evident that he had some idea in his head, that he felt thoroughly within his rights, and he looked like an unconcerned spectator — that is, as though he were anybody’s servant rather than Mr. Golyadkin’s."
"“我说，那个，好伙计，”我们的主人公气喘吁吁地开口问，“几点了？”","“I say, you know, my good lad,” our hero began breathlessly, “what time is it?”"
"彼得鲁什卡没有说话，走到隔板后，回来时用一种不受拘束的口吻宣布快要七点半了。","Without speaking, Petrushka went behind his partition, then returned, and in a rather independent tone announced that it was nearly half-past seven."
"“嗯，好，知道了，伙计。好了，你看，孩子……允许我告诉你，我的好伙计，我想，现在我们之间的一切都结束了。”","“Well, that’s all right, my lad, that’s all right.Come, you see, my boy ... allow me to tell you, my good lad, that everything, I fancy, is at an end between us.”"
"彼得鲁什卡什么也没说。","Petrushka said nothing."
"“既然我们之间的一切都结束了，请你以一个朋友的身份，坦率地告诉我你去哪儿了。”","“Well, now as everything is over between us, tell me openly, as a friend, where you have been.”"
"“我去哪儿了？去见好人了，先生。”","“Where I’ve been?To see good people, sir.”"
"“我知道，我的好伙计，我知道。我一直都对你很满意，还要给你开份服务满意证明……那么，你现在和他们处得怎么样？”","“I know, my good lad, I know.I have always been satisfied with you, and I give you a character ... Well, what are you doing with them now?”"
"“啊，先生！您自己知道的。我们都知道，正人君子是不会教你学坏的。”","“Why, sir!You know yourself.We all know a decent man won’t teach you any harm.”"
"“我知道，我的朋友，我知道。现今，好人少了，我的伙计。珍惜他们，我的朋友。对了，他们怎么样？”","“I know, my dear fellow, I know.Nowadays good people are rare, my lad; prize them, my friend.Well, how are they?”"
"“当然了，他们……只是我不能再伺候您了，先生。您一定也知道这一点。”","“To be sure, they ... Only I can’t serve you any longer, sir; as your honour must know.”"
"“我知道，亲爱的，我知道你热情而忠于职守。这些我全看到眼里了，伙计，我注意到这些了。我很尊重你，我的朋友。我敬重善良而诚实的人，即使他是个佣人。”","“I know, my dear fellow, I know your zeal and devotion; I have seen it all, my lad, I’ve noticed it.I respect you, my friend.I respect a good and honest man, even though he’s a lackey.”"
"“啊，是的，当然了！当然了，您自己也是知道的，我们的喜好跟别人一样。不就是这么回事嘛。我们都知道，先生，没有好人那是不行的。”","“Why, yes, to be sure!The likes of us, of course, as you know yourself, are as good as anybody.That’s so.We all know, sir, that there’s no getting on without a good man.”"
"“很好，很好，孩子，我感觉……来，这是你的工钱和你的服务满意证明。老弟，现在咱们吻别吧……来吧，就现在，伙计，我有一事相求，最后一件事。”戈利亚德金先生用严肃的口吻说，“你明白，什么事情都会发生的，亲爱的孩子。金碧辉煌的宫殿里也隐藏着痛苦，让人无法摆脱。你知道，孩子，我一直对你不错，孩子。”","“Very well, very well, my boy, I feel it...Come, here’s your money and here’s your character.Now we’ll kiss and say good-bye, brother...Come, now, my lad, I’ll ask one service of you, one last service,” said Mr. Golyadkin, in a solemn voice.“You see, my dear boy, all sorts of things happen.Sorrow is concealed in gilded palaces, and there’s no escaping it.You know, my boy, I’ve always been kind to you, my boy.”"
"彼得鲁什卡默不作声。","Petrushka remained mute."
"“我相信我一向待你不薄，亲爱的……来，我们现在有多少亚麻布衣服，亲爱的孩子？”","“I believe I’ve always been kind to you, my dear fellow ... Come, how much linen have we now, my dear boy?”"
"“全在这里了。六件亚麻布衬衣、三双袜子、四件衬衫胸衣、几件法兰绒马甲和两套内衣内裤。您自己也都知道。您的东西我一件也没拿，先生……我好好看管主人家的财物，先生。我是那样的人，先生……我们都清楚……我从来……没有做过什么愧对别人的事，先生，您自己也知道，先生……”","“Well, it’s all there.Linen shirts six, three pairs of socks; four shirtfronts; flannel vests; of underlinen two sets.You know all that yourself.I’ve got nothing of yours, sir...I look after my master’s belongings, sir.I am like that, sir ... we all know ... and I’ve ... never been guilty of anything of the sort, sir, you know yourself, sir ...”"
"“我相信你，伙计，我相信你。我不是那个意思，我的朋友，我不是那个意思，你知道，伙计。我告诉你……”","“I trust you, my lad, I trust you.I didn’t mean that, my friend, I didn’t mean that, you know, my lad; I tell you what ... ”"
"“当然，先生，我们都清楚这些。我以前在斯托尔布尼亚科夫将军家当差的时候……他们全家搬到萨拉托夫去了……他们在那边有一个庄园……”","“To be sure, sir, we know that already.Why, when I used to be in the service at general Stolnyakov’s ... I lost the lace through the family’s going away to Saratov ... they’ve an estate there ...”"
"“不，伙计，我不是那个意思，我不是那个意思。你不要往那方面想，亲爱的伙计……”","“No; I didn’t mean that, my lad, I didn’t mean that; don’t think anything of the sort, my dear fellow ...”"
"“那自然的。您也知道，先生，我们做下人的很容易被人说闲话。可是，我伺候过部长、将军、议员、伯爵，他们都对我很满意。我曾在斯文恰特金公爵家、彼列波尔金上校家和尼多巴罗夫将军家服侍过——他们也都搬到自己的庄园去了。我们都知道……”","“To be sure.It’s easy, as you know yourself, sir, to take away the character of folks like us.And I’ve always given satisfaction — ministers, generals, senators, counts — I’ve served them all.I’ve been at Prince Svintchatkin’s, at Colonel Pereborkin’s, at General Nedobarov’s — they’ve gone away too, they’ve gone to their property.As we all know ...”"
"“是呀，伙计，很好。伙计，很好。现在，我要离开了，我的朋友……每个人面前的路都不同，没有人知道他要走的路会如何。好了，伙计，把我的外套拿出来，还有我的制服……还有裤子、床单、被子和枕头……”","“Yes, my lad, very good, my lad, very good.And now I’m going away, my friend ... A different path lies before each man, no one can tell what road he may have to take.Come, my lad, put out my clothes now, lay out my uniform too ... and my other trousers, my sheets, quilts and pillows ...”"
"“要把所有的东西都装进包里吗？”","“Am I to pack them all in the bag?”"
"“是的，伙计，是的。请装进包里。谁知道我们还会发生什么事情。好了，好孩子，你出去叫一辆马车吧……”","“Yes, my lad, yes; the bag, please.Who knows what may happen to us. Come, my dear boy, you can go and find a carriage ...”"
"“叫辆马车？”","“A carriage?...””"
"“是的，伙计，叫辆马车。叫个宽敞一点的，按小时计费。你不要多想……”","“Yes, my lad, a carriage; a roomy one, and take it by the hour.And don’t imagine anything ...”"
"“您要出远门吗，先生？”","“Are you planning to go far away, sir?”"
"“不知道，伙计，这我也不知道。我想你最好把我的羽绒褥子也放进去吧。你觉得怎么样，伙计？我就指望你了，亲爱的朋友……”","“I don’t know my lad, I don’t know that either.I think you had better pack my feather bed too.What do you think, my lad?I am relying on you, my dear fellow ...”"
"“您要马上出发？”","“Is your honour setting off at once?”"
"“是的，我的朋友，是的！事情发展到了这一步，那……那就这样吧，我亲爱的朋友，就这样吧……”","“Yes, my friend, yes!Circumstances have turned out so ... so it is, my dear fellow, so it is ...”"
"“当然了，先生。我们还在军队里时，陆军中尉也曾发生过这样的事情。他们从一个乡下绅士那儿私奔了…","“To be sure, sir; when we were in the regiment the same thing happened to the lieutenant; they eloped from a country gentleman’s ...”"
"“私奔？怎么私奔？亲爱的伙计！”","“Eloped? …How! My dear fellow!”... How!My dear fellow!”"
"“是的，先生，私奔了，在另一座房子里举行了婚礼。一切都事先安排好了。他们受到了追捕，但已故的公爵替他们说了好话，所以事情就解决了……”","“Yes, sir, eloped, and they were married in another house.Everything was got ready beforehand.There was a hue and cry after them; the late prince took their part, and so it was all settled ...”"
"“他们结了婚，但是……这怎么，亲爱的朋友……你是怎么知道的，孩子？”","“They were married, but ... how is it, my dear fellow ... How did you come to know, my boy?”"
"“啊，当然知道啦！满世界都是传言，先生。我们知道，先生，我们都……当然了，谁没做过错事呀。只是，我现在要告诉您，先生，允许我朴实通俗地说，先生。既然已经到了这份上，我必须告诉您，先生。您有一个敌人——您有一个敌人，一个强大的敌人，所以……”","“Why, to be sure!The earth is full of rumours, sir.We know, sir, we’ve all ... to be sure, there’s no one without sin.Only I’ll tell you now, sir, let me speak plainly and vulgarly, sir; since it has come to this, I must tell you, sir; you have an enemy — you’ve a rival, sir, a powerful rival, so there ...”"
"“我知道，亲爱的朋友，我知道。你也知道，亲爱的朋友……所以，你看，我现在要指望你。我们现在该怎么办，我的朋友！你给我什么建议呢？”","“I know, my dear fellow, I know; you know yourself, my dear fellow...So, you see, I’m relying upon you.What are we to do now, my friend!How do you advise me?”"
"“啊，先生，如果您现在要这样的话，也就是说，您要走这条路的话，先生，您就得买点东西——比如床单、枕头，还要再添一套双人床羽绒褥子和质量好的被子——在楼下的邻居那儿就能买——她开了个商店，先生——她有上好的狐狸皮斗篷，所以你可以看一看，买下来，你也许现在就该去看看。您现在就需要，先生。斗篷质量很不错，缎子里，还衬有狐狸皮……”","“Well, sir, if you are in that way now, if you’ve come, so to say, to such a pass, sir, you’ll have to make some purchases, sir — say some sheets, pillows, another feather bed, a double one, a good quilt — here at the neighbours downstairs — she’s a shopkeeper, sir — she has a good fox-fur cloak, so you might look at it and buy it, you might have a look at it at once.You’ll need it now, sir; it’s a good cloak, sir, satin-lined with fox ...”"
"“很好，伙计，很好，我同意。我就指望你了，我完全指望你了。就买一件斗篷吧，如果需要的话……不过，快点，赶紧！看在上帝的份上，要快！我要买个斗篷——只是，请快点！马上就八点了。看在上帝的份上，快点，亲爱的伙计！快点，伙计……”","“Very good, my lad, very good, I agree; I rely upon you, I rely upon you entirely; a cloak by all means, if necessary ... Only make haste, make haste!For God’s sake make haste!I’ll buy the cloak — only please make haste!It will soon be eight o’clock.Make haste for God’s sake, my dear lad!Hurry up, my lad ...”"
"彼得鲁什卡赶紧把内衣、枕头、被子、床单，以及各种各样的零碎东西收到一起，捆起来，匆忙地冲出了房间。这时，戈利亚德金先生又把信拿出来，但读不下去了。他双手抱着疼得要死的脑袋，靠在墙上，呆在那里。他什么也想不了，什么也做不了，甚至自己也不知道发生了什么事。最后，他看到时间一点一点过去，彼得鲁什卡没有回来，皮斗篷也没买回来，戈利亚德金先生决定亲自去一趟。打开通道处的门，他听到楼下传来一阵嘈杂声、谈话声、争辩声，以及打斗的声音……旁边几所公寓的女人正在为什么事情而大喊、争吵和抗议——戈利亚德金先生知道其中原因。彼得鲁什卡的声音传来，接着响起一阵脚步声。","Petrushka ran up to gather together a bundle of linen, pillows, quilt, sheets, and all sorts of odds and ends, tied them up and rushed headlong out of the room.Meanwhile, Mr. Golyadkin seized the letter once more, but he could not read it.Clutching his devoted head, he leaned against the wall in a state of stupefaction.He could not think of anything, he could do nothing either, and could not even tell what was happening to him.At last, seeing that time was passing and neither Petrushka nor the fur cloak had made their appearance, Mr. Golyadkin made up his mind to go himself.Opening the door into the entry, he heard below noise, talk, disputing and scuffling...Several of the women of the neighbouring flats were shouting, talking and protesting about something—Mr. Golyadkin knew what.Petrushka’s voice was heard: then there was a sound of footsteps."
"“我的上帝！他们会把全世界的人都带到这里来的。”戈利亚德金先生呻吟着，绝望地紧握着手，转身跑回了他的房间。他跑回房间后，倒在沙发上，几乎毫无知觉，脸埋进了枕头里。他就这样躺了一分钟后，跳了起来。他没有等彼得鲁什卡回来就穿上套鞋，戴上帽子，披上厚外套，抓起他的证件，径直朝楼下跑去。","“My goodness!They’ll bring all the world in here,” moaned Mr. Golyadkin, wringing his hands in despair and rushing back into his room.Running back into his room, he fell almost senseless on the sofa with his face in the pillow.After lying a minute in this way, he jumped up and, without waiting for Petrushka, he put on his goloshes, his hat and his greatcoat, snatched up his papers and ran headlong downstairs."
"“什么也不需要，什么也不需要，亲爱的伙计！我自己会办好一切的——一切都由我自己办。我暂时不需要你。而且现在，事情也许会有好的转机。”戈利亚德金先生在楼梯上遇见彼得鲁什卡时对他说。然后，他跑出了房子，到了院子里。他的心跳变得虚弱，还没有拿定主意，不知道自己的处境如何，不知道要做什么，也不知道在眼前这个关键时刻该怎么做。","“Nothing is wanted, nothing, my dear fellow!I will manage myself — everything myself.I don’t need you for the time, and meantime, things may take a better turn, perhaps,” Mr. Golyadkin muttered to Petrushka, meeting him on the stair; then he ran out into the yard, away from the house.There was a faintness at his heart, he had not yet made up his mind what was his position, what he was to do, how he was to act in the present critical position."
"“是呀，我该怎么办？上帝，帮帮我吧！这一切竟然发生了！”他最后绝望地大叫了起来，在街上漫无目的地蹒跚着，“这一切发生一定是有原因的！唉，若没有这事，若这事没有发生，一起都会正常了。只要一下子，一个巧妙、有力、坚实的举动就能让一切正常。我情愿牺牲我的一根手指把一切恢复正常！而且，我的确知道如何把这问题解决。解决的方法如下：我先到那地方去……说清楚是怎么回事。我会说：‘先生，请允许我指出，我客观地看待这件事……不能那样做。’我会说：‘亲爱的先生，事情不应该那样做，司里不能接受一个冒充者，一个冒充者……我亲爱的先生，他……卑鄙无耻，对祖国毫无益处。你明白我的话吗？你明白我的话吗，亲爱的先生？’我会这样这样说。就是这样……但是，不……毕竟，事情不是这样的……完全不是这样……我在胡说八道，就像个傻瓜一样！一个自取灭亡的傻瓜！事情根本就不是那样的，你这个自取灭亡的傻瓜……不过，木已成舟，你这个放荡的人！……那么，我自己现在要怎么办？啊，我自己现在要做些什么？我现在适合做什么？想想，你现在适合做些什么？比如，戈利亚德金，你，你这个没用的东西！唉，现在怎么办？我得去雇辆马车。‘雇辆马车，来这里。’她说，‘没有马车，我们的脚会给弄湿的。’她这么说……谁会像她这样考虑周到呢！哎呀，哎呀，我年轻的姑娘！哎呀，哎呀，品德高尚的年轻姑娘！啊，啊，我们人见人爱的女孩呀！你与众不同，小姐，这一点毫无疑问！你与众不同！……这一切都源于你受到的邪恶的教育。我已经仔细研究，完完全全地看透了。这完全是因为道德沦丧。他们没有把她当小孩子照管……有时候拿棍棒教训……而是塞给她糖果和美味的食品。她父亲常常溺爱她，说什么‘我亲爱的，我的宝贝，我的美人，我们要把你嫁给一个伯爵！’现在，她自己站出来，打出了自己的牌，就像是说出那些都是她的小游戏一样。他们没有把她当孩子一样关在家里，而是把她送到寄宿学校里一个法国女人那儿。她是一个移民，叫巴尔巴拉女士还是什么名字。她在这位女士那里学了各种东西，就变成了现在这样。‘到这里来，’她说，‘高兴点儿！坐着马车来。在这个时间，在窗户下唱一曲西班牙风格的多情小夜曲。我会等你，我知道你爱我，我们要一起远走高飞，一起住小茅屋。’事实上，这一切是不可能的。事情既然已经到了这个地步，小姐，不可能逃走了。不经父母同意，从他们的家里诱拐清白且有名望的少女是违法的。如果你要那样做，原因是什么呢？为了什么？有什么必要呢？算了吧，她应该嫁给一个相配的人。这个人应该是她命中注定的伴侣，事情应就此结束。而我是个政府工作人员，这样做的话，我可能官位不保。小姐，我可能会因此而被捕的！就是这样的！如果你之前不知道的话，我告诉你。都是那个德国女人在捣鬼。她才是一切的主谋，这个巫婆。这一切都她一手造成的。因为他们听从了安德雷·菲利波维奇的意见，经常造谣嫁祸一个男人，编造了一些关于他的婆婆妈妈的闲话。事情就是这么来的。不然的话，彼得鲁什卡怎么会卷进来？这和他有什么关系呢？这个恶棍掺和进来干什么？不，我不能，小姐，我绝对不能这么干，无论如何都不能……不，小姐，这次你必须原谅我。你是罪魁祸首，小姐，这并非全是那个德国人干的。这根本就不是那个巫婆所为，完完全全是你造成的。因为那个巫婆是个好人，因为无论如何都不能怪她。都是你的错，小姐。你才是该承担罪过的人，让我告诉你！小姐，我不能因为你而被定罪。一个男人也许会被毁……一个男人也许会迷失自己，无法控制自己——是的的确确要举行一场婚礼呀！一切又要如何结束呢？这一切又要如何安排呢？我愿意付出昂贵的代价去知道这些！”","“Yes, how am I to act?Lord, have mercy on me!And that all this should happen!” he cried out at last in despair, tottering along the street at random; “that all this must needs happen!Why, but for this, but for just this, everything would have been put right; at one stroke, at one skillful, vigorous, firm stroke it would have been set right.I would have my finger cut off to have set right!And I know, indeed, how it would have been settled.This is how it would have been managed: I’d have gone on the spot ... said how it was ... ‘with your permission, sir, I’m neither here nor there in it ... things aren’t done like that,’ I would say, ‘my dear sir, things aren’t done like that, there’s no accepting an imposter in our office; an imposter ... my dear sir, is a man ... who is worthless and of no service to his country.Do you understand that?Do you understand that, my dear sir,’ I should say!That’s how it would be ... But no ... after all, things are not like that ... not a bit like that ... I am talking nonsense, like a fool!A suicidal fool!It’s not like that at all, you suicidal fool ... This is how things are done, though, you profligate man!... Well, what am I to do with myself now?Well, what am I going to do with myself now.What am I fit for now?Come, what are you fit for now, for instance, you, Golyadkin, you, you worthless fellow!Well, what now?I must get a carriage; ‘hire a carriage and bring it here,’ says she, ‘we shall get our feet wet without a carriage,’ says she ... And who could ever have thought it!Fie, fie, my young lady!Fie, fie, a young lady of virtuous behaviour!Well, well, the girl we all thought so much of!You’ve distinguished yourself, madam, there’s no doubt of that! you’ve distinguished yourself!you’ve distinguished yourself!... And it all comes from immoral education.And now that I’ve looked into it and seen through it all I see that it is due to nothing else but immorality.Instead of looking after her as a child ... and the rod at times ... they stuff her with sweets and dainties, and the old man is always doting over her: saying ‘my dear, my love, my beauty,’ saying, ‘we’ll marry you to a count!’ ... And now she has come forward herself and shown her cards, as though to say that’s her little game!Instead of keeping her at home as a child, they sent her to a boarding school, to a French madame, and emigre, a Madame Falbalas or something, and she learned all sorts of things at that Madame Falbalas’, and this is how it always turns out.‘Come,’ says she, ‘and be happy!Be in a carriage,’ she says, ‘at such a time, under the windows, and sing a sentimental serenade in the Spanish style; I await you and I know you love me, and we will fly together and live in a hut.’But the fact is it’s impossible; since it has come to that, madam, it’s impossible, it is against the law to abduct an innocent, respectable girl from her parents’ roof without their sanction!And, if you come to that, why, what for and what need is there to do it?Come, she should marry a suitable person, the man marked out by destiny, and that would be the end of it.But I’m in the government service, I might lose my berth through it: I might be arrested for it, madam!I tell you that!If you did not know it.It’s that German woman’s doing.She’s at the bottom of it all, the witch; she cooked the whole kettle of fish.For they’ve slandered a man, for they’ve invented a bit of womanish gossip about him, a regular performance by the advice of Andrey Filippovitch, that’s what it came from.Otherwise how could Petrushka be mixed up in it?What has he to do with it?What need for the rogue to be in it?No, I cannot, madam, I cannot possibly, not on any account ... No, madam, this time you must really excuse me.It’s all your doing, madam, it’s not all the German’s doing, it’s not the witch’s doing at all, but simply yours.For the witch is a good woman, for the witch is not to blame in any way; it’s your fault, madam; it’s you who are to blame, let me tell you!I shall not be charged with a crime through you, madam...A man might be ruined ... a man might lose sight of himself, and not be able to restrain himself — a wedding, indeed!And how is it all going to end?And how will it all be arranged?I would give a great deal to know all that!…”...”"
"所以，我们的主人公绝望地思索着。他突然清醒过来，发现自己正站在铸铁街的某个地方。天气很糟糕，正值解冻时期。雨雪混杂着落下来——跟那个难忘的时刻一模一样，那个可怕的午夜是戈利亚德金先生一切麻烦事的开始。“这真是个适合旅行的美好夜晚呀！”戈利亚德金先生看着天想道，“全世界都死亡了……上帝呀！这个时候，我去哪儿找马车呀？我觉得，那边角落里似乎有个黑乎乎的东西。咱们来看看，咱们来调查调查……上帝，保佑我！”我们的主人公继续前行，弓着腰，迈着虚弱摇晃的步伐。他看见那个方向似乎停着一辆马车。","So our hero reflected in his despair.Coming to himself suddenly, he observed that he was standing somewhere in Liteyny Street.The weather was awful: it was a thaw; snow and rain were falling — just as at that memorable time when at the dread hour of midnight all Mr. Golyadkin’s troubles had begun.“This is a nice night for a journey!” thought Mr. Golyadkin, looking at the weather; “it’s death all round...Good Lord!Where am I to find a carriage, for instance?I believe there’s something black there at the corner.We’ll see, we’ll investigate ... Lord, have mercy on us!” our hero went on, bending his weak and tottering steps in the direction in which he saw something that looked like a cab."
"“不，我知道要做什么。我要直接过去，跪倒在地，尽我可能谦逊地乞求，就说：‘我把我的命运交付在你手上，交付在我的上司手里。大人，求您保护我，求您可怜我。’然后，我还要如此这般说，解释这一切，告诉他这样是违背法律的。‘不要毁了我，我一直视您为父亲，不要抛弃我……救救我的人格、尊严、姓名和名誉……把我从这个罪大恶极的人手里救出来吧……他是另外一个人，大人，我也是另外一个人。他是他，我是我。大人，我真的只是我自己。’我就要把以上的话说出。‘我不可能像他那样。改造他，开除他，命令他改变，压制他邪恶、放肆的冒充行为……这对其他人来说，也许会成为一个例子，大人。我把您当父亲仰慕。’那些位居我们之上的人，我们的恩人，保护者，当然一定会鼓励这样的提议……这还带点骑士精神。我还要说：‘我的恩人，我的上司，我把您当父亲一样仰慕，不会说出违背命运的话。我把自己交付给您，自愿辞职。’这就是我要说的。”","“No, I know what I’ll do; I’ll go straight and fall on my knees, if I can, and humbly beg, saying ‘I put my fate in your hands, in the hands of my superiors’; saying, ‘Your Excellency, be a protector and a benefactor’; and then I’ll say this and that, and explain how it is and that it is an unlawful act; ‘Do not destroy me, I look upon you as my father, do not abandon me ... save my dignity, my honour, my name, my reputation ... and save me from a miscreant, a vicious man...He’s another person, your Excellency, and I’m another person too; he’s apart and I am myself by myself too; I am really myself by myself, your Excellency; really myself by myself,’ that’s what I shall say.‘I cannot be like him.Change him, dismiss him, give orders for him to be changed and a godless, licentious impersonation to be suppressed ... that it may not be an example to others, your Excellency.I look upon you as a father’; those in authority over us, our benefactors and protectors, are bound, of course, to encourage such impulses...There’s something chivalrous about it: I shall say, ‘I look upon you, my benefactor and superior, as a father, and trust my fate to you, and I will not say anything against it; I put myself in your hands, and retire from the affair myself’ ... that’s what I would say.”"
"“哎，伙计，您是马车车夫吗？”","“Well, my man, are you a cabman?”"
"“是的……”","“Yes ...”"
"“我想今晚用下马车……”","“I want a cab for the evening ...”"
"“您要出远门吗？”","“And does your honour want to go far?”"
"“就是今天晚上，今天晚上。伙计，不要管我去哪儿，不要管我去哪儿。”","“For the evening, for the evening; wherever I have to go, my man, wherever I have to go.”"
"“您要出城吗？”","“Does your honour want to drive out of town?”"
"“是的，我的朋友，也许要出城去。我自己还不知道是否要出城。我不能确定地告诉你，伙计。你看着，也许一切都会妥善解决。我们都知道，我的朋友……”","“Yes, my friend, out of town, perhaps.I don’t quite know myself yet, I can’t tell you for certain, my man.Maybe you see it will all be settled for the best.We all know, my friend ...”"
"“是的，先生。我们当然都知道。但愿上帝保佑。”","“Yes, sir, of course we all know.Please God it may.”"
"“是的，我的朋友，是的。谢谢你，伙计。对了，大好人，你如何收费？”","“Yes, my friend, yes; thank you, my dear fellow; come, what’s your fare, my good man?…”...”"
"“您想立刻出发吗？”","“Do you want to set off at once?”"
"“是的，马上就动身。是这样，不，你必须在一个地方等候……等一会儿，不会太久的，你必须等一会儿……”","“Yes, at once, that is, no, you must wait at a certain place...A little while, not long, you’ll have to wait...”"
"“喔，如果你雇整个晚上的话，这天气，少于六卢布是不行的?……”","“Well, if you hire me for the whole time, I couldn’t ask less than six roubles for weather like this ...”"
"“哦，很好，我的朋友。我谢谢你，亲爱的伙计。那么，好啦，我们现在可以出发了，大好人。”","“Oh, very well, my friend; and I thank you, my dear fellow.So, come, you can take me now, my good man.”"
"“请上车。对不起，让我先把车厢里稍微收拾一下——好了，大人，请上车。我们要去哪儿？”","“Get in; allow me, I’ll put it straight a bit — now will your honour get in.Where shall I drive?”"
"“去伊兹梅洛夫桥，我的朋友。”","“To the Ismailovsky Bridge, my friend.”"
"车夫扑通坐在箱子上，费力地把两匹瘦骨嶙峋的老马拽离装有草料的马槽，向伊兹梅洛夫桥驶去。但是，戈利亚德金先生突然拽了一下绳子，要马车停下。他用恳求的声音恳请车夫不要去伊兹梅洛夫桥，而是掉头去另一条街。车夫把车赶到了另一条街上。十分钟后，戈利亚德金先生刚刚雇佣的马车停在了司长大人的住所前面。戈利亚德金先生下了马车，请求车夫答应等着。他自己跑上四楼，拉响了门铃，心情沉重。门开了，我们的主人公发现自己站在司长家的门口。","The driver plumped down on the box, with difficulty roused his pair of lean nags from the trough of hay, and was setting off for Ismailovsky Bridge.But suddenly Mr. Golyadkin pulled the cord, stopped the cab, and besought him in an imploring voice not to drive to Ismailovsky Bridge, but to turn back to another street.The driver turned into another street, and then minutes later Mr. Golyadkin’s newly hired equipage was standing before the house in which his Excellency had a flat.Mr. Golyadkin got out of the carriage, begged the driver to be sure to wait and with a sinking heart ran upstairs to the third storey and pulled the bell; the door was opened and our hero found himself in the entry of his Excellency’s flat."
"“请问司长大人在家吗？”戈利亚德金先生问开门的这个人。","“Is his Excellency graciously pleased to be at home?” said Mr. Golyadkin, addressing the man who opened the door."
"“你有什么事？”仆人问道，从头到脚打量着戈利亚德金先生。","“What do you want?” asked the servant, scrutinizing Mr. Golyadkin from head to foot."
"“我，我的朋友……我叫戈利亚德金，小文官，戈利亚德金……就说……是这样的，那个……我来解释点事情……”","“I, my friend ... I am Golyadkin, the titular councillor, Golyadkin ... To say ... something or other ... to explain ...”"
"“请稍等，你现在不能进去……”","“You must wait; you cannot ...”"
"“我的朋友，我没有时间等候了。我的事情很重要，刻不容缓……”","“My friend, I cannot wait; my business is important, it’s business that admits of no delay ...”"
"“谁派你来的？你有介绍信吗？”","“But from whom have you come?Have you brought papers?...””"
"“没有，我的朋友。我是因自己的原因而来的。请您通报一声，我的朋友。随便说说，解释一下。我会感激你的，大好人……”","“No, my friend, I am on my own account.Announce me, my friend, say something or other, explain.I’ll reward you, my good man ...”"
"“不行。司长大人不在家，他有客人。你上午十点再来吧……”","“I cannot.His Excellency is not at home, he has visitors.Come at ten o’clock in the morning ...”"
"“请您通报一声，大好人。我没有时间等了，来不及了——不可能等下去了……你要对此事负责，大好人。”","“Take in my name, my good man, I can’t wait — it is impossible...You’ll have to answer for it, my good man.”"
"“哎呀，你就去替他通报一声吧！你这是怎么回事？怕皮鞋会磨坏吗？”另外一个仆人说。他懒洋洋地坐在长凳上，一直没有说话。","“Why, go and announce him!What’s the matter with you; want to save your shoe leather?” said another lackey who was lolling on the bench and had not uttered a word till then."
"“怕磨坏皮鞋！你知道，我被吩咐不要领任何人进去。他们早上才能拜访。”","“Shoe leather!I was told not to show any one up, you know; their time is the morning.”"
"“去替他通报吧，难道你不会说话了？”","“Announce him, have you lost your tongue?”"
"“我这就去替他通报——我还能说话。我接到的命令不是这样的。我告诉过你，我接到的命令不是这样的。请进来。”","“I’ll announce him all right — I’ve not lost my tongue.It’s not my orders; I’ve told you, it’s not my orders.Walk inside.”"
"戈利亚德金先生进了最边上的房间。屋里的桌子上有个钟。他看了一眼钟：已是晚上八点半了。他的心隐隐作痛。他已经想转身离去了，但这个时候，仆人站在隔壁屋子的门口，用低沉的声音叫着戈利亚德金先生的名字。","Mr. Golyadkin went into the outermost room; there was a clock on the table.He glanced at it: it was half-past eight.His heart ached within him.Already he wanted to turn back, but at that very moment the footman standing at the door of the next room had already boomed out Mr. Golyadkin’s name."
"“啊，这声音，真是的。”我们的主人公想，内心的痛苦无法描述，“唉，你应该说：‘他无比谦逊恭敬，前来解释……作出一个解释……一件事……见到他觉得莫大的荣幸。’现在，一切都毁了，我所有的希望都在风中飘散了。但是……尽管如此……没有关系……”","“Oh, what lungs,” thought our hero in indescribable misery.“Why, you ought to have said: ‘he has come most humbly and meekly to make an explanation ... something ... be graciously pleased to see him’ ... Now the whole business is ruined; all my hopes are scattered to the winds.But ... however ... never mind ...”"
"况且，也没时间考虑了。那个仆人返回来，说：“请进。”他把戈利亚德金先生领进了书房。","There was no time to think, moreover.The lackey, returning, said, “Please walk in,” and led Mr. Golyadkin into the study."
"我们的主人公进去之后，觉得似乎眼睛瞎了一样，什么也看不见……但是好像有三四个人影在他眼前晃动。“哦，是的，这是客人。”戈利亚德金先生的脑子里闪过这样的念头。终于，我们的主人公可以看清了司长大人黑色大衣上面的星形勋章。然后，他一点一点地看到了黑色大衣，最后看到了周围的一切……","When our hero went in, he felt as though he were blinded, for he could see nothing at all ... But three or four figures seemed flitting before his eyes: “Oh, yes, they are the visitors,” flashed through Mr. Golyadkin’s mind.At last our hero could distinguish clearly the star on the black coat of his Excellency, then by degrees advanced to seeing the black coat and at last gained the power of complete vision..."
"“这是什么？”戈利亚德金先生的头顶传来一个熟悉的声音。","“What is it?” said a familiar voice above Mr. Golyadkin."
"“小文官戈利亚德金，司长大人。”","“The titular councillor, Golyadkin, your Excellency.”"
"“什么事？”","“Well?”"
"“我来是向您解释一件事情的。”","“I have come to make an explanation ...”"
"“怎么回事？什么事？”","“How?…What?”... What?”"
"“嗯，是的。是这么回事。我是来向您解释，司长大人……”","“Why, yes.This is how it is.I’ve come for an explanation, your Excellency ...”"
"“但是你……你是谁？”","“But you ... but who are you?...”"
"“戈利亚德金先——先——先生，大人，一个小文官。”","“M-m-m-mist-er Golyadkin, your Excellency, a titular councillor.”"
"“哦，你想怎么样？”","“Well, what is it you want?”"
"“唔，事情是这样的，我一直把您当父亲仰慕。我辞……请保护我，不要让敌人伤害我！”","“Why, this is how it is, I look upon you as a father; I retire ... defend me from my enemy!…”...”"
"“这到底是怎那么回事？”","“What’s this?…”...”"
"“我们都知道……”","“We all know ...”"
"“我们都知道什么呀？”","“What do we all know?”"
"戈利亚德金先生沉默了，他的下巴开始微微颤抖起来。","Mr. Golyadkin was silent: his chin began twitching a little."
"“说呀？”","“Well?”"
"“我想这有点骑士精神，大人……‘有点骑士精神在里面，’我说，‘我把上司视作父亲。’这就是我所想的。‘请保护我，我泪——泪眼——婆娑地请求您，这样的提——提议——应——应该受到您的鼓励……’”","“I thought it was chivalrous, your Excellency ... ‘There’s something chivalrous in it,’ I said, ‘and I look upon my superior as a father’ ... this is what I thought; ‘protect me, I tear ... earfully ... b ... eg and that such imp ... impulses ought ... to ... be encouraged ...’”"
"司长大人扭过头去，我们的主人公有好几分钟都什么也看不清。他感到胸口压了块大石头。他感到呼吸困难，不知道自己站在什么地方……他觉得羞愧又伤心。天知道后来发生了什么……清醒之后，我们的主人公看到司长大人在和他的客人谈话，似乎兴致很高，在强调什么事情。戈利亚德金先生立刻认出了其中的一个客人。他认出了安德雷·菲利波维奇，其余的人他不认识。但还有一个人看起来很面熟——一个个子高大、身材魁梧、中等年纪、眉毛浓密、胡须旺盛、表情犀利的人。这个人胸前挂着勋章，嘴里叼着雪茄。这位绅士一边抽着烟，一边意味深长地点着头，雪茄一直在嘴里叼着。他时不时地瞟一眼戈利亚德金先生。戈利亚德金先生被看得很不舒服。他把目光移开，立即看到另一个非常奇怪的客人。我们的主人公一直把门口当成是一面镜子，这种情况以前也曾发生过——一个人出现了——我们知道是谁：一位戈利亚德金先生认识且很亲密的朋友。其实，小戈利亚德金先生之前一直呆在隔壁的一个小屋里，在匆忙地写些什么东西。现在，很明显，司长需要他来——他腋下夹着文件出来了，到司长跟前去。他站在安德雷·菲利波维奇后面一点的位置，隔着那个抽着雪茄烟的人看他的举动，等待大家注意他，然后巧妙地加入到大家的谈话和讨论中。很显然，小戈利亚德金先生对谈话的内容有很强烈的兴趣，正很绅士地听着，不时点点头，脚烦躁地动着，面带微笑，不断地看看司长大人——似乎用眼神祈求他给自己个插话的机会。","His excellency turned away, our hero for some minutes could distinguish nothing.There was a weight on his chest.His breathing was laboured; he did not know where he was standing ... He felt ashamed and sad.God knows what followed...Recovering himself, our hero noticed that his Excellency was talking with his guests, and seemed to be briskly and emphatically discussing something with them.One of the visitors Mr. Golyadkin recognized at once.This was Andrey Filippovitch; he knew no one else; yet there was another person that seemed familiar — a tall, thick-set figure, middle-aged, possessed of very thick eyebrows and whiskers and a significant sharp expression.On his chest was an order and in his mouth a cigar.This gentleman was smoking and nodding significantly without taking the cigar out of his mouth, glancing from time to time at Mr. Golyadkin.Mr. Golyadkin felt awkward; he turned away his eyes and immediately saw another very strange visitor.Through a door which our hero had taken for a looking-glass, just as he had done once before — he made his appearance — we know who: a very intimate friend and acquaintance of Mr. Golyadkin’s.Mr. Golyadkin junior had actually been till then in a little room close by, hurriedly writing something; now, apparently, he was needed — and he came in with papers under his arm, went up to his Excellency, and while waiting for exclusive attention to be paid him succeeded very adroitly in putting his spoke into the talk and consultation, taking his place a little behind Andrey Filippovitch’s back and partly screening him from the gentleman smoking the cigar.Apparently Mr. Golyadkin junior took an intense interest in the conversation, to which he was listening now in a gentlemanly way, nodding his head, fidgeting with his feet, smiling, continually looking at his Excellency — as it were beseeching him with his eyes to let him put his word in."
"“无耻！”戈利亚德金先生心想，不由自主地向前走了一步。这时，司长大人转过身来，迟疑地朝戈利亚德金先生走来。","“The scoundrel,” thought Mr. Golyadkin, and involuntarily he took a step forward.At this moment his Excellency turned round and came rather hesitatingly towards Mr. Golyadkin."
"“嗯，好吧，好吧。嗯，你先回去吧。我会仔细考虑你的事情，给你命令让你去执行……”","“Well, that’s all right, that’s all right; well, run along, now.I’ll look into your case, and give orders for you to be taken ...”"
"说到这儿，司长大人朝那个胡须浓密的先生看了一眼。那人点头表示同意。","At this point his Excellency glanced at the gentleman with the thick whiskers.The latter nodded in assent."
"戈利亚德金先生感觉到，而且完全明白他们接见他是因为别的事情，根本不会认真地理会他。","Mr. Golyadkin felt and distinctly understood that they were taking him for something different and not looking at him in the proper light at all."
"“无论如何，我一定要解释清楚。”他想，“我必须说：‘司长大人，事情是这样的。’”","“In one way or another I must explain myself,” he thought; “I must say, ‘This is how it is, your Excellency.’”"
"这时，他在困惑中垂下眼睛，看着地板。令他惊讶不已的是，他看到司长大人靴子上有一大片白色的补丁。","At this point in his perplexity he dropped his eyes to the floor and to his great astonishment he saw a good-sized patch of something white on his Excellency’s boots."
"“难道下面是个洞？”戈利亚德金先生心想。然而，戈利亚德金先生很快就确信司长大人的靴子没有穿破，只是在熠熠闪光——这种现象充分说明了司长大人的靴子是黑漆皮制成，而且被仔仔细细地擦过了。","“Can there be a hole in them?” thought Mr. Golyadkin.Mr. Golyadkin was, however, soon convinced that his Excellency’s boots were not split, but were only shining brilliantly — a phenomenon fully explained by the fact that they were patent leather and highly polished."
"“这就是人们所说的光斑。”我们的主人公心想，“这个词是专门在艺术家的工作室里用的。在其他地方，这样的反光叫光棱。”","“It is what they call blick,” thought our hero; “the term is used particularly in artists studios; in other places such a reflected light is called a rib of light.”"
"这时，戈利亚德金先生抬起眼睛来，觉得该是他说话的时间了，因为事情可能会以悲剧收场……","At this point Mr. Golyadkin raised his eyes and saw that the time had come to speak, for things might easily end badly ..."
"我们的主人公向前走了一步。","Our hero took a step forward."
"“我说，大人，事情是这样的。”他说，“这个年代不能接受冒名顶替者。”","“I say this is how it is, your Excellency,” he said, “and there’s no accepting imposters nowadays.”"
"司长大人没有作答，而是使劲拉响了铃。我们的主人公又朝前迈了一步。","His Excellency made no answer, but rang the bell violently.Our hero took another step forward."
"“他是个卑鄙邪恶的家伙，大人。”我们的主人公说。他不知所措，因为害怕而有点晕眩。但他还是大胆而坚决地指着他那卑鄙的相貌相像之人，那个人正在离司长大人不远的地方，烦躁不安。“事情就是这样。我指的是某个很有名气的人物。”","“He is a vile, vicious man, your Excellency,” said our hero, beside himself and faint with terror, though he still pointed boldly and resolutely at his unworthy twin, who was fidgeting about near his Excellency.“I say this is how it is, and I am alluding to a well-known person.”"
"戈利亚德金先生的话富有感情。安德雷·菲利波维奇和那个叼着雪茄的人点着头，而司长大人却不耐烦地拉响召唤仆人的门铃。这时，小戈利亚德金先生向前迈了一步。","There was a general sensation at Mr. Golyadkin’s words.Andrey Filippovitch and the gentleman with the cigar nodded their heads; his Excellency impatiently tugged at the bell to summon the servants.At this point Mr. Golyadkin junior came forward in his turn."
"“司长大人，”他说，“我冒昧地恳求您允许我说一句。”小戈利亚德金先生语气坚决，一切都显示出他觉得自己这么做完全正确。","“Your Excellency,” he said, “I humbly beg permission to speak.”There was something very resolute in Mr. Golyadkin junior’s voice; everything showed that he felt himself completely in the right."
"“请允许我问您，”他又开始了，热切地期待司长大人回答，不过这次是对戈利亚德金先生说的，“请允许我问您，您这话是当着谁的面说的？您这是站在谁面前？在谁的房间里？”","“Allow me to ask you,” he began again, anticipating his Excellency’s reply in his eagerness, and this time addressing Mr. Golyadkin; “allow me to ask you, in whose presence you are making this explanation?Before whom are you standing, in whose room are you?…”...”"
"小戈利亚德金先生异常激动，因为生气和愤慨而脸涨得通红，如在灼烧一般。眼睛里分明充满了泪水。","Mr. Golyadkin junior was in a state of extraordinary excitement, flushed and glowing with wrath and indignation; there were positively tears in his eyes."
"一个仆人出现在门口，用自己最大的声音喊着新到客人的名字：巴萨夫留科夫夫妇。","A lackey, appearing in the doorway, roared at the top of his voice the name of some new arrivals, the Bassavryukovs."
"“一个很好的贵族名字，来自小俄罗斯。”戈利亚德金先生心想。这个时候，他感觉有人友好地把手搭在他的背上，接着，另一只手也搭在了他背上。戈利亚德金先生道德败坏的相貌相像者正轻快地在前面领路。我们的主人公清楚地看到自己正被押解到房间的大门处。","“A good aristocratic name, hailing from Little Russia,” thought Mr. Golyadkin, and at that moment he felt some one lay a very friendly hand on his back, then a second hand was laid on his back.Mr. Golyadkin’s infamous twin was tripping about in front leading the way; and our hero saw clearly that he was being led to the big doors of the room."
"“这跟在奥尔苏菲·伊万诺维奇家一样。”他想，发现自己已经到了大厅里。他转过身，看到司长家的两名仆人和他的相貌相像者在他身旁。","“Just as it was at Olsufy Ivanovitch’s,” he thought, and he found himself in the hall.Looking round, he saw beside him two of the Excellency’s lackeys and his twin."
"“外套，外套，外套，外套，我的朋友！我好朋友的外套！”那个邪恶的家伙低声叫着，一把从仆人手里抢过外套，卑鄙而又失礼地开着玩笑，把外套扔到戈利亚德金先生的头上。戈利亚德金先生从外套下钻出来时，清楚地听到那两个仆人的讥笑声。但是，他对这一切都不闻不顾，走出大厅，来到灯光耀眼的台阶上。小戈利亚德金先生跟着他。","“The greatcoat, the greatcoat, the greatcoat, the greatcoat, my friend!The greatcoat of my best friend!” whispered the depraved man, snatching the coat from one of the servants, and by way of a nasty and ungentlemanly joke flinging it straight at Mr. Golyadkin’s head.Extricating himself from under his coat, Mr. Golyadkin distinctly heard the two lackeys snigger.But without listening to anything, or paying attention to it, he went out of the hall and found himself on the lighted stairs.Mr. Golyadkin junior following him."
"“再见，大人！”他在老戈利亚德金先生身后大声喊。","“Goodbye, your Excellency!” he shouted after Mr. Golyadkin senior."
"“卑鄙小人！”我们的主人公失去了控制，大声叫道。","“Scoundrel!” our hero exclaimed, beside himself."
"“喔，卑鄙小人，那又怎么样……”","“Well, scoundrel, then ...”"
"“道德败坏！”","“Depraved man!…”...”"
"“喔，道德败坏，那又怎样……”戈利亚德金先生那个卑鄙的敌人回答说，他站在台阶顶上，用他特有的下贱方式直直地俯视着戈利亚德金先生的脸，似乎在祈求他继续说下去。我们的主人公气得吐了口唾沫，跑出了前门。他心烦意乱，吃了败仗，一点也记不得怎么上的马车，或是谁扶他上了马车。恢复了意识之后，他发现马车已经来到了芳坦卡河附近。“这是要去伊兹梅洛夫桥？”戈利亚德金先生心想。这时，戈利亚德金先生努力回忆起别的事情，但他什么也想不起来。有些事情恐怖得让他无法解释……“嗯，没关系。”我们的主人公最后这么想，他来到了伊兹梅洛夫桥。","“Well, depraved man, then ...” answered Mr. Golyadkin’s unworthy enemy, and with his characteristic baseness he looked down from the top of the stairs straight into Mr. Golyadkin’s face as though begging him to go on.Our hero spat with indignation and ran out of the front door; he was so shattered, so crushed, that he had no recollection of how he got into the cab or who helped him in.Coming to himself, he found that he was being driven to Fontanka.“To Ismailovsky Bridge, then,” thought Mr. Golyadkin.At this point Mr. Golyadkin tried to think of something else, but could not; there was something so terrible that he could not explain it ... “Well, never mind,” our hero concluded, and he drove to Ismailovsky Bridge."
"第十三章","CHAPTER 13"
"……看来天气好像要转好了。此前大团大团从天而降的雪现在变得清晰起来，透过正在落下的雪还能看到闪闪的星星。不过，空气潮湿、浑浊，让人感觉很闷，特别是对于戈利亚德金先生而言，他原本就喘不过气来了。他的外套完全湿透了，变得很重，散发出一股难闻的湿热气息，弥漫到他的全身。他原本就疲倦无力的双腿感觉更沉了。他像发了烧似的打了个寒颤，顿时感觉全身剧烈地疼痛。他筋疲力竭，全身冒冷汗，十分痛苦。戈利亚德金先生每逢显示他坚强不屈的性格的时机，总爱说：“一切很可能，一定，可能会好起来的。”但是，现在糟糕的境况让他都忘了说这句话。“不过，这一切目前都没关系。”我们的主人公重复着这句话。他依然坚定，毫不灰心丧气，从脸上抹去冰冷的雨滴。雨水从他那圆筒礼帽的沿上滴下来，流地到处都是。他的礼帽已经湿透了，再也盛不了水了。我们的主人公继续重复着，说一切目前都没关系。他在奥尔苏菲·伊万诺维奇家院子的一堆柴火旁的一根粗木头上坐了下来。当然，现在想西班牙小夜曲或缎带绳梯也没什么用处了，但是很有必要想着找个比较隐蔽舒服的角落，即使不是特别暖和也罢。我们可以顺便提一下，他现在特别向往奥尔苏菲·伊万诺维奇家公寓后门入口处的那个角落。几乎就在这个真实的故事开始的时候，我们的主人公就曾在那儿的一个食橱和旧屏风中间站了两个小时，旁边还有各种各样的旧家具和废弃的垃圾。事实上，现在戈利亚德金先生已经在奥尔苏菲·伊万诺维奇家的院子里站了整整两个小时了。但是，那个隐蔽而舒适的小角落现在也有了以前不存在的缺陷。第一个缺陷是自从奥尔苏菲·伊万诺维奇家上次举办舞会出现丑闻后，那个地方现在可能已经不再隐蔽，肯定有针对它的预防措施实施。第二，他还得等候克拉拉·奥尔苏菲耶夫娜的信号，因为她一定会给他发出某种信号的，这种情形下总是要有个信号。“不是我们开的头，也不应由我们结束。”","... It seemed as though the weather meant to change for the better.The snow, which had till then been coming down in regular clouds, began growing visible and here and there tiny stars sparkled in it.It was only wet, muddy, damp and stifling, especially for Mr. Golyadkin, who could hardly breathe as it was.His greatcoat, soaked and heavy with wet, sent a sort of unpleasant warm dampness all through him and weighed down his exhausted legs.A feverish shiver sent sharp, shooting pains all over him; he was in a painful cold sweat of exhaustion, so much so that Mr. Golyadkin even forgot to repeat at every suitable occasion with his characteristic firmness and resolution his favourite phrase that “it all, maybe, most likely, indeed, might turn out for the best.”“But all this does not matter for the time,” our hero repeated, still staunch and not downhearted, wiping from his face the cold drops that streamed in all directions from the brim of his round hat, which was so soaked that it could hold no more water.Adding that all this was nothing so far, our hero tried to sit on a rather thick clump of wood, which was lying near a heap of logs in Olsufy Ivanovitch’s yard.Of course, it was no good thinking of Spanish serenades or silken ladders, but it was quite necessary to think of a modest corner, snug and private, if not altogether warm.He felt greatly tempted, we may mention in passing, by that corner in the back entry of Olsufy Ivanovitch’s flat in which he had once, almost at the beginning of this true story, stood for two hours between a cupboard and an old screen among all sorts of domestic odds and ends and useless litter.The fact is that Mr. Golyadkin had been standing waiting for two whole hours on this occasion in Olsufy Ivanovitch’s yard.But in regard to that modest and snug little corner there were certain drawbacks which had not existed before.The first drawback was the fact that it was probably now a marked place and that certain precautionary measures had been taken in regard to it since the scandal at Olsufy Ivanovitch’s last ball.Secondly, he had to wait for a signal from Klara Olsufyevna, for there was bound to be some such signal, it was always a feature in such cases and, “it didn’t begin with us and it won’t end with us.”"
"这个时候，戈利亚德金先生非常适时地想起了他很久之前读过的一部小说。在小说里，女主人公在和今天极度相似的情形之下，给艾尔弗雷德发出一个信号——她在窗户上系了一条粉色的丝带。但是，现在是晚上，在以潮湿和天气多变著称的彼得斯堡，用粉色的缎带做信号几乎是不合适的，也是完全不可能的。","At this point Mr. Golyadkin very appropriately remembered a novel he had read long ago in which the heroine, in precisely similar circumstances, signalled to Alfred by tying a pink ribbon to her window.But now, at night, in the climate of Petersburg, famous for its dampness and unreliability, a pink ribbon was hardly appropriate and, in fact, was utterly out of the question."
"“不，这不是缎带绳梯的事。”我们的主人公心想，“我最好还是安静舒服地呆在这里……我最好站在这里好。”","“No, it’s not a matter of silk ladders,” thought our hero, “and I had better stay here quietly and comfortably ... I had better stand here.”"
"他选择了院子里正对着窗户的一块地方站着，旁边是一堆柴火。当然，许多人，包括马夫和车夫，不停地在院子里穿梭。此外，还有车轮声和马的鼻吸声，等等。然而，这个地方还是比较方便，不管有没有人看到他。现在，这个地方基本上处于阴影中，没有人可以看到戈利亚德金先生，而一切都在他的视野中。","And he selected a place in the yard exactly opposite the window, near a stack of firewood.Of course, many persons, grooms and coachmen, were continually crossing the yard, and there was, besides, the rumbling of wheels and the snorting of horses and so on; yet it was a convenient place, whether he was observed or not; but now, anyway, there was the advantage of being to some extent in the shadow, and no one could see Mr. Golyadkin while he himself could see everything."
"窗户里灯光明亮，奥尔苏菲·伊万诺维奇家正在举行某种隆重正式的聚会。但到目前为止，他还没有听到什么音乐。","The windows were brightly lit up, there was some sort of ceremonious party at Olsufy Ivanovitch’s.But he could hear no music as yet."
"“可见，这不是舞会，而是别的什么聚会。”我们的主人公心里想，感觉有点惊恐。“是今天吗？”一团疑云浮过他的脑海，“我把日期搞错了吗？也许，什么事情都是有可能的……是的，当然了，什么事情都是有可能的……也许她是昨天给我写的信，只是我没有收到。也许我昨天没有收到是因为彼得鲁什卡故意破坏，这个混蛋！也许是明天，是的——坐马车来等她……”","“So it’s not a ball, but a party of some other sort,” thought our hero, somewhat aghast.“Is it today?” floated the doubt through him.“Have I made a mistake in the date?Perhaps; anything is possible...Yes, to be sure, anything is possible ... Perhaps she wrote a letter to me yesterday, and it didn’t reach me, and perhaps it did not reach me because Petrushka put his spoke in, the rascal!Or it was tomorrow, that is — wait with a carriage...”"
"这个时候，我们的主人公全身有一阵冷意袭来，他把手伸进口袋里去找信，想确认一下。但令他吃惊的是，信已经不在口袋里了。","At this point our hero turned cold all over and felt in his pocket for the letter, to make sure.But to his surprise the letter was not in his pocket."
"“这是怎么回事？”戈利亚德金先生嘟囔着，此刻觉得生不如死，“我把它放在哪里了？要不然我一定是把它弄丢了。那可是最后的救命稻草！”他最后伤心地说。“啊，万一落到坏人手里怎么办！也许已经落到坏人手里了。上帝啊！这会闹出什么事来！也许结果会这样……啊，我的命好苦呀！”这时，他想到也许他那邪恶的相貌相像者扔给他外套时就偷了他的信，也许是自己的敌人通过某种方式暗示他有这么一封信。想到这儿，戈利亚德金先生开始像叶子一样颤抖。","“How’s this?” muttered Mr. Golyadkin, more dead than alive.“Where did I leave it?Then I must have lost it.That is the last straw!” he moaned at last.“Oh, if it falls into evil hands!Perhaps it has already.Good Lord!What may it not lead to!It may lead to something such that ... Ach, my miserable fate!”At this point Mr. Golyadkin began trembling like a leaf at the thought that perhaps his vicious twin had thrown the greatcoat at him with the object of stealing the letter of which he had somehow got an inkling from Mr. Golyadkin’s enemies."
"“再说，他偷了信，”我们的主人公心想，“是要留住证据……可是，要证据干什么！”","“What’s more, he’s stealing it,” thought our hero, “as evidence ... but why evidence!…”...”"
"一阵震惊和恐惧之后，血液一下子冲上了戈利亚德金先生的脑袋。他呻吟着，咬牙切齿，抱住他那要燃烧起来的脑袋，瘫坐在他的那段木头上，陷入沉思中……但是，他无法形成连贯的思想。人影不停地在他脑海里闪现。他想起了一些事，时而模糊，时而清晰，一些傻傻的歌曲旋律一直在他耳畔响起……他陷入极度痛苦之中，很不正常的痛苦！","After the first shock of horror, the blood rushed to Mr. Golyadkin’s head.Moaning and gnashing his teeth, he clutched his burning head, sank back on his block of wood and relapsed into brooding...But he could form no coherent thought.Figures kept flitting through his brain, incidents came back to his memory, now vaguely, now very distinctly, the tunes of some foolish songs kept ringing in his ears...He was in great distress, unnatural distress!"
"“上帝呀，上帝！”我们的主人公心想，稍微恢复了一点意识，极力压制住低沉的啜泣声，“请赐予我面对这巨大折磨的力量吧。我完蛋了，彻底完蛋了——这一点是毫无疑问的，而且这一切都发展得十分自然，因为它只能是这样。首先，我丢了差事，我确定是丢了差事，一定丢了……喔，就算事情凑合摆平了。假设我开始时钱还够花，我必须再租一套房子，买些家具什么的……首先，彼得鲁什卡是不能用了。没有这个骗子我还过得好……不管怎么说，可以从房东那儿得到些帮助。喔，那样也不错！我可以随意进出，彼得鲁什卡不会唠叨我回来得晚——是的，就是这样。这就是有房东的好处……唉，就算这一切都好，不过这一切都无关紧要了。”","“My God, my God!” our hero thought, recovering himself a little, and suppressing a muffled sob, “give me fortitude in the immensity of my afflictions!That I am done for, utterly destroyed — of that there can be no doubt, and that’s all in the natural order of things, since it cannot be otherwise.To begin with, I’ve lost my berth, I’ve certainly lost it, I must have lost it ... Well, supposing things are set right somehow.Supposing I have money enough to begin with: I must have another lodging, furniture of some sort...In the first place, I shan’t have Petrushka.I can get on without the rascal ... somehow, with help from the people of the house; well, that will be all right!I can go in and out when I like, and Petrushka won’t grumble at my coming in late — yes, that is so; that’s why it’s a good thing to have the people in the house...Well, supposing that’s all right; but all that’s nothing to do with it.”"
"这时，戈利亚德金先生又突然想起他现实中的处境。他向四周看了看。","At this point the thought of the real position again dawned upon Mr. Golyadkin’s memory.He looked round."
"“噢，上帝呀，帮帮我吧，一定要帮帮我！我在说些什么呀？”他想，变得完全绝望了，用双手死死抱住自己快要燃烧起来的脑袋……","“Oh, Lord, have mercy on me, have mercy on me!What am I talking about?” he thought, growing utterly desperate and clutching his burning head in his hands..."
"“先生，您不是很快就走吗？”一个声音在戈利亚德金先生头顶响起。我们的主人公惊了一下。车夫站在他面前，浑身也湿透了，哆嗦着。他等得不耐烦了，又没有事情可做，便想起应该来柴火堆后面看看戈利亚德金先生。","“Won’t you soon be going, sir?” a voice pronounced above Mr. Golyadkin.Our hero started; before him stood his cabman, who was also drenched through and shivering; growing impatient, and having nothing to do, he had thought fit to take a look at Mr. Golyadkin behind the woodstack."
"“我很好，我的朋友……我很快就来，很快，很快的。你等会儿……”","“I am all right, my friend ... I am coming soon, soon, very soon; you wait ...”"
"车夫走开了，自言自语地嘟囔着。“他嘟囔什么？”戈利亚德金先生眼里噙着泪水想着，“真是的，我雇了他整个晚上。那么，我……有权这样……就是这样的！我雇了他整个晚上，还有什么可说的？即使他站着，也是一样。这都由我决定。走或不走是我的自由。我呆在柴堆后面和这事毫无关系……你什么也不能说。想想，绅士愿意站在柴堆后边，那他就站在柴堆后边……这并不玷污任何人的尊严！事实就是这样。","The cabman walked away, grumbling to himself.“What is he grumbling about?”Mr. Golyadkin wondered through his tears.“Why, I have hired him for the evening, why, I’m ... within my rights now ... that’s so!I’ve hired him for the evening and that’s the end of it.If one stands still, it’s just the same.That’s for me to decide.I am free to drive on or not to drive on.And my staying here by the woodstack has nothing to do with the case... and don’t dare to say anything; think, the gentleman wants to stand behind the woodstack, and so he’s standing behind it ... and he is not disgracing any one’s honour!That’s the fact of the matter."
"“小姐，如果你想知道，我告诉你是怎么回事。现如今，小姐，没有人住草棚，或者诸如此类的屋子。真的没有。在我们这个工业时代，品行不端可是不行的。小姐，你就是一个很坏的榜样……你说我们必须找到一份当股长的工作，住海滨的茅草房。首先，小姐，海滨没有股长；其次，我们找不到股长这样的工作。因为，比如说我上交了申请，推荐我自己——说我想申请股长或类似的职位……请大人保护我不受敌人的伤害……他们会告诉你，小姐，他们肯定会这么说，……我们有太多股长了，你不是在巴尔巴拉女子学校。你在那儿学习行为规范，自己就是个反面的例子。小姐，好的行为意思是呆在家里，孝敬父亲，而不是过早地想着嫁人。小姐，时机到了，求婚者自然会来，就是这样！当然了，你一定要有一些本领，比如时而弹弹钢琴、说法语、懂历史、晓地理、读经典、会算数，这就是其中精意！你有这些就够了。还有做饭，做饭当然也是一个行为良好的女子应受教育的一部分！就是这样，我漂亮的小姐，首先他们不会放你走，会在你身后大喊大叫，然后他们会把你锁进修道院里。小姐，然后要怎么办？你然后叫我怎么办？小姐，你会让我学那些愚蠢小说中的做法吗？让我爬上附近的山丘，泪流满面地看着你被囚禁其中的“监狱”的冰冷墙壁，最后死去，就像一些悲惨的德国诗人和小说家那样。是这样吗，小姐？不过，首先，请允许我作为朋友告诉你，事情不能那样办；其次，如果我让你读法国小说，那就像把你和你的父母痛打了一顿一样，因为法国小说不会教给你什么好东西。小说有种毒药……有害的毒药，小姐！或者你是认为，请允许我问一下，或者你认为我们要私奔而且免受惩罚，或者类似的事……我们会在海滨有个小茅屋，等等。我们在那里谈情说爱，表达感情，幸福而满足地生活。我们再生些孩子——所以我们就……我们去找我们的父亲，五品文官奥尔苏菲·伊万诺维奇，说：‘我们生了个小宝宝，如此等等。您就趁这个吉祥的时刻取消对我们的诅咒吧，祝福我们夫妻俩吧。’不，小姐，我再次告诉你，不能这么做。首先，不会有什么谈情说爱，请你就不要这么想了。当今，小姐，丈夫是一家之主。受过良好教养的妻子应该尽力在各方面讨丈夫欢心。小姐，卿卿我我在这个工业化时代已经不受欢迎了。让·雅克·卢梭的时代已经一去不复返了。比如说，丈夫下班回到家，肚子饿了，问妻子：‘亲爱的，有什么吃的吗？有伏特加酒喝吗？有咸鱼吃吗？’所以那时，小姐，你就必须备齐伏特加酒和鲱鱼。你的丈夫会津津有味地吃这些食物，顾不上看你一眼。他只会说：‘我的小猫咪，你去厨房忙吧。’然后忙着吃饭。他一周最多吻你一次，甚至有些冷漠……我们的生活就会是这个样子，我的小姑娘！是的，甚至有点冷漠……日子就会是这个样子，如果想一下，如果真要从这个角度看问题……况且，我是怎么卷入其中的？你为什么要把我搅和进你的任性胡闹中去？还说什么‘这个为你受苦受难的高尚之人永远是你心中的爱恋。’等等。但是，小姐，首先我与你不合适，你自己也知道。我不擅长说恭维话，也不喜欢为女士们说附庸风雅的琐事。我不赏识那些专门勾引女人的人，而且我必须承认，我从来不是一个美男子。我现在无比真诚地告诉你，你不会在我身上发现狂妄自大和虚荣的特征。这就是事实：我们只以直来直去和开朗的性格，以及常识而自夸。我们从来不会密谋什么。我不会耍阴谋，我这么说，而且以此为荣——这就是事实！……在直率的人们面前，我从来不戴面具。告诉你全部的事实吧……”","“I tell you what is it is, madam, if you care to know.Nowadays, madam, nobody lives in a hut, or anything of that sort.No, indeed.And in our industrial age there’s no getting on without morality, a fact of which you are a fatal example, madam ... You say we must get a job as a register clerk and live in a hut on the sea-shore.In the first place, madam, there are no register clerks on the sea-shore, and in the second place we can’t get a job as a register clerk.For supposing, for example, I send in a petition, present myself — saying a register clerk’s place or something of the sort ... and defend me from my enemy ... they’ll tell you, madam, they’ll say, to be sure ... we’ve lots of register clerks, and here you are not at Madame Falbalas’, where you learnt the rules of good behaviour of which you are a fatal example.Good behaviour, madam, means staying at home, honouring your father and not thinking about suitors prematurely.Suitors will come in good time, madam, that’s so!Of course, you are bound to have some accomplishments, such as playing the piano sometimes, speaking French, history, geography, scripture and arithmetic, that’s the truth of it!And that’s all you need.Cooking, too, cooking certainly forms part of the education of a well-behaved girl!But as it is, in the first place, my fine lady, they won’t let you go, they’ll raise a hue and cry after you, and then they’ll lock you up in a nunnery.How will it be then, madam?What will you have me do then?Would you have me, madam, follow the example of some stupid novels, and melt into tears on a neighbouring hillock, gazing at the cold walls of your prison house, and finally die, following the example of some wretched German poets and novelists.Is that it, madam?But, to begin with, allow me to tell you, as a friend, that things are not done like that, and in the second place I would have given you and your parents, too, a good thrashing for letting you read French books; for French books teach you no good.There’s a poison in them ... a pernicious poison, madam!Or do you imagine, allow me to ask you, or do you imagine that we shall elope with impunity, or something of that sort ... that we shall have a hut on the shore of the sea and so on; and that we shall begin billing and cooing and talking about our feelings, and that so we shall spend our lives in happiness and content; and then there would be little ones — so then we shall ... shall go to our father, the civil councillor, Olsufy Ivanovitch, and say, ‘we’ve got a little one, and so, on this propitious occasion remove your curse, and bless the couple.’No, madam, I tell you again, that’s not the way to do things, and for the first thing there’ll be no billing and cooing and please don’t reckon on it.Nowadays, madam, the husband is the master and a good, well-brought-up wife should try and please him in every way.And endearments, madam, are not in favour, nowadays, in our industrial age; the day of Jean Jacques Rousseau is over.The husband comes home, for instance, hungry from the office, and asks, ‘Isn’t there something to eat, my love, a drop of vodka to drink, a bit of salt fish to eat?’So then, madam, you must have the vodka and the herring ready.Your husband will eat it with relish, and he won’t so much as look at you, he’ll only say ‘Run into the kitchen, kitten,’ he’ll say, and look after the dinner, and at most, once a week, he’ll kiss you, even then rather indifferently ... That’s how it will be with us, my young lady!Yes, even then indifferently...That’s how it will be, if one considers it, if it has come to one’s looking at the thing in that way...And how do I come in?Why have you mixed me up in your caprices?‘The noble man who is suffering for your sake and will be dear to your heart for ever,’ and so on.but in the first place, madam, I am not suited to you, you know yourself, I’m not a great hand at compliments, I’m not fond of uttering perfumed trifles for the ladies.I’m not fond of lady-killers, and I must own I’ve never been a beauty to look at.You won’t find any swagger or false shame in me, and I tell you so now in all sincerity.This is the fact of the matter: we can boast of nothing but a straightforward, open character and common sense; we have nothing to do with intrigues.I am not one to intrigue, I say so and I’m proud of it — that’s the fact of the matter!... I wear no mask among straightforward people, and to tell you the whole truth...”"
"突然，戈利亚德金先生惊了一下。车夫又一次出现在柴堆旁边，他红色的胡子完全湿透了。","Suddenly Mr. Golyadkin started.The red and perfectly sopping beard of the cabman appeared round the woodstack again..."
"“我马上就来，朋友。我马上就来，你知道的。”戈利亚德金先生的声音颤抖而弱小。","“I am coming directly, my friend.I’m coming at once, you know,” Mr. Golyadkin responded in a trembling and failing voice."
"车夫挠了挠头，然后摸了摸胡子，朝前走了一步……他静静地站着，用怀疑的目光看着戈利亚德金先生。","The cabman scratched his head, then stroked his beard, and moved a step forward... stood still and looked suspiciously at Mr. Golyadkin."
"“我马上就来，朋友。你知道，朋友……我……请稍等片刻，你知道，就一秒钟！再等一秒钟……嗯，你明白，朋友……”","“I am coming directly, my friend; you see, my friend ... I ... just a little, you see, only a second!…more…here, you see, my friend…”... more ... here, you see, my friend...”"
"“您到底来不来呢？”车夫最后直接走到戈利亚德金先生面前问道。","“Aren’t you coming at all?” the cabman asked at last, definitely coming up to Mr. Golyadkin."
"“不，朋友，我马上就来。我在等，你明白，朋友……”","“No, my friend, I’m coming directly.I am waiting, you see, my friend...”"
"“我看出来了……”","“So I see ...”"
"“你知道，朋友，我……你是哪儿的人，朋友？”","“You see, my friend, I ... What part of the country do you come from, my friend?”"
"“我们是农奴……”","“We are under a master ...”"
"“你的主人对你好吗？”","“And have you a good master?…”...”"
"“还好……”","“All right ...”"
"“好，朋友。你呆在这儿，朋友，你知道……朋友，你在彼得斯堡呆了很久了吗？”","“Yes, my friend; you stay here, my friend, you see ... Have you been in Petersburg long, my friend?”"
"“我呆了大概有一年了……”","“It’s a year since I came ...”"
"“你过得好吗，朋友？”","“And are you getting on all right, my friend?”"
"“一般吧。”","“Middling.”"
"“一定的，朋友，一定的。你要感谢上帝，朋友。你一定要找坦率的人。现如今，坦率的人不太常见，朋友。好人会给你衣服，供你吃喝，朋友。但有时候，朋友，你会看到有人为金钱落泪……你会看到一个令人惋惜的例子。这就是事实，朋友……”","“To be sure, my friend, to be sure.You must thank Providence, my friend.You must look out for straightforward people.Straightforward people are none too common nowadays, my friend; he would give you washing, food, and drink, my good fellow, a good man would.But sometimes you see tears shed for the sake of gold, my friend ... you see a lamentable example; that’s the fact of the matter, my friend...”"
"车夫似乎感到同情戈利亚德金先生。“唔，大人，我再等您一会儿。您还要等很长时间吗？”","The cabman seemed to feel sorry for Mr. Golyadkin.“Well, your honour, I’ll wait.Will your honour be waiting long?”"
"“不，朋友，不。我……你知道……我不会再等下去了，，大好人……你觉得呢，朋友？我就指望你了。我不会再呆下去了。”","“No, my friend, no; I ... you know ... I won’t wait any longer, my good man ... What do you think, my friend?I rely upon you.I won’t stay any longer.”"
"“您哪里也不去了？”","“Aren’t you going at all?”"
"“不去了，朋友，哪儿也不去了。我会付给你钱，朋友……就这样吧。我该付你多少钱，亲爱的朋友？”","“No, my friend, no; I’ll reward you, my friend ... that’s the fact of the matter.How much ought I to give you, my dear fellow?”"
"“先生，您雇了我，请一定付钱。我在这儿等了很久，您对我要公平啊，先生。”","“What you hired me for, please, sir.I’ve been waiting here a long time; don’t be hard on a man, sir.”"
"“嗯，给你，大好人，给你。”","“Well, here, my good man, here.”"
"这时，戈利亚德金先生给了车夫六个卢布，而且认真地作了决定，不再浪费时间了，而是要立即离开。何况，车夫已经走了，一切都结束了，所以再等下去也没用了。他跑出了院子，出了大门，朝左一拐，便头也不回地拔脚飞奔起来，气喘吁吁，却感到很高兴。“也许一切都会好起来。”他想，“也许这样我就逃开了这些麻烦事。”戈利亚德金先生突然觉得心情顿时放松了。“噢，要是一切都好起来的话，那有多好！”我们的主人公心想，虽然他对自己的话也没抱多大希望。“我知道我要做什么……”他想，“不，我知道，我还是最好尝试另一种方案……或者，这样做更好？”就这样，我们的主人公踌躇不定，寻求解决自己疑惑的方法。他跑到了谢苗诺夫桥，但到达后，又理智坚决地决定返回去。","At this point Mr. Golyadkin gave six roubles to the cabman, and made up his mind in earnest to waste no more time, that is, to clear off straight away, especially as the cabman was dismissed and everything was over, and so it was useless to wait longer.He rushed out of the yard, went out of the gate, turned to the left and without looking round took to his heels, breathless and rejoicing.“Perhaps it will all be for the best,” he thought, “and perhaps in this way I’ve run away from trouble.”Mr. Golyadkin suddenly became all at once light-hearted.“Oh, if only it could turn out for the best!” thought our hero, though he put little faith in his own words.“I know what I’ll do ...” he thought.“No, I know, I’d better try the other tack ... Or wouldn’t it be better to do this?…”In this way, hesitating and seeking for the solution of his doubts, our hero ran to Semyonovsky Bridge; but while running to Semyonovsky Bridge he very rationally and conclusively decided to return."
"“这样才会更好。”他想，“我最好尝试另一个方案，也就是说……我会就——我会仅仅当个旁观者，一个旁观者——其他什么都不是，不管发生什么事情——这不是我的错，这是事实！现在就这么办。”","“It will be better so,” he thought.“I had better try the other tack, that is ... I will just go — I’ll look on simply as an outsider, an outsider — and nothing more, whatever happens — it’s not my fault, that’s the fact of the matter!That’s how it shall be now.”"
"决定返回之后，我们的主人公果真返回了。他毫不迟疑，因为现在按照这个欢喜的想法，他把自己完全当成了局外人。","Deciding to return, our hero actually did return, the more readily because with this happy thought he conceived of himself now as quite an outsider."
"“这是最好的事。我不用负任何责任，而且该看到的都不会错过……事情本来就该是这样！”","“It’s the best thing; one’s not responsible for anything, and one will see all that’s necessary ... that’s the fact of the matter!”"
"这是一个稳妥的计划，事情会迎刃而解。他安下心来，蹑手蹑脚地回到他那个令人放心的防护柴堆旁边，处于其安全的保护之下，开始集中精力盯着窗户看。这次，他观察和等待的时间注定不长。突然，所有的窗户一下子奇怪地出现了骚动。几个人影出现了，窗帘被拉开，所有的人都聚集在奥尔苏菲·伊万诺维奇家的窗户前。所有人都朝窗外看，似乎在寻找院子里的什么东西。在柴堆的掩护下，我们的主人公也开始好奇地观察这奇怪的大骚动。他很感兴趣，在那柴堆的阴影范围内，伸出头去，左右观望。突然，他吃了一惊，屏住呼吸，吓得几乎坐到地上。他似乎——一下子意识到，他们要找的正是他，戈利亚德金先生！所有的人都朝他这个方向看来。逃跑是不可能的，他们已经看见了他……一阵躁动之后，戈利亚德金先生尽可能地蜷缩起来，紧贴着柴堆。到这个时候，他才注意到这个奸诈的阴影背叛了他，并没有完全遮住他。我们的主人公当时一定会很乐意钻到柴堆里的老鼠洞里面去，在那里老老实实地呆着，如果可以这样做的话。但这是绝对不可能的。在极度痛苦之中，他最后开始公开大胆地朝窗口看，这是能做的最好的事了……突然，他羞愧得脸都红了。他完全暴露了，大家立刻一起朝他看来。他们都在招手，都在朝他点头，都在叫他的名字。然后，几扇窗户打开了，发出咯吱咯吱的声音，几个人同时向他喊叫些什么……","It was a safe plan and that settled it.Reassured, he crept back under the peaceful shelter of his soothing and protecting woodstack, and began gazing intently at the window.This time he was not destined to gaze and wait long.Suddenly a strange commotion became apparent at all the windows.Figures appeared, curtains were drawn back, whole groups of people were crowding to the windows at Olsufy Ivanovitch’s flat.All were peeping out looking for something in the yard.From the security of his woodstack, our hero, too, began with curiosity watching the general commotion, and with interest craned forward to right and to left so far as he could within the shadow of the woodstack.Suddenly he started, held his breath and almost sat down with horror.It seemed to him — in short, he realized, that they were looking for nothing and for nobody but him, Mr. Golyadkin!Every one was looking in his direction.It was impossible to escape; they saw him ... In a flutter, Mr. Golyadkin huddled as closely as he could to the woodstack, and only then noticed that the treacherous shadow had betrayed him, that it did not cover him completely.Our hero would have been delighted at that moment to creep into a mouse-hole in the woodstack, and there meekly to remain, if only it had been possible.But it was absolutely impossible.In his agony he began at last staring openly and boldly at the windows, it was the best thing to do...And suddenly he glowed with shame.He had been fully discovered, every one was staring at him at once, they were all waving their hands, all were nodding their heads at him, all were calling to him; then several windows creaked as they opened, several voices shouted something to him at once..."
"“我都奇怪这些淘气的女孩子小时候为什么不挨鞭子。”我们的主人公自言自语地嘟囔着，完全失去了理智。突然，有个人从台阶上跑下来——我们都知道他是谁——没穿外套，也没戴帽子，上气不接下气地搓着手，扭动着，跳跃着，居心险恶地表现出看到戈利亚德金先生后的欣喜。","“I wonder why they don’t whip these naughty girls as children,” our hero muttered to himself, losing his head completely.Suddenly there ran <— ?Suddenly there ran down the steps he (we know who), without his hat or greatcoat, breathless, rubbing his hands, wriggling, capering, perfidiously displaying intense joy at seeing Mr. Golyadkin."
"“雅科夫·彼得罗维奇，”这个因卑鄙而臭名昭著的人低声说，“雅科夫·彼得罗维奇，你在这儿吗？你会感冒的。这儿很冷，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇。到屋里来吧。”","“Yakov Petrovitch,” whispered this individual, so notorious for his worthlessness, “Yakov Petrovitch, are you here?You’ll catch cold.It’s chilly here, Yakov Petrovitch.Come indoors.”"
"“雅科夫·彼得罗维奇！不用了，我很好，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇。”我们的主人公顺从地嘟囔着。","“Yakov Petrovitch!No, I’m all right, Yakov Petrovitch,” our hero muttered in a submissive voice."
"“不，那不行，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇，我求你了，我谦卑地求你加入我们。他们说：‘雅科夫·彼得罗维奇，去欢迎他，并把他请进来。’”","“No, this won’t do, Yakov Petrovitch, I beg you, I humbly beg you to wait with us. ‘Make him welcome and bring him in,’ they say, ‘Yakov Petrovitch.’”"
"“不用了，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇，你知道，我最好……我最好还是回家，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇……”我们的主人公说，像被慢火烘烤一样，同时又因恐惧和羞耻而冷得发抖。","“No, Yakov Petrovitch, you see, I’d better ... I had better go home, Yakov Petrovitch ...” said our hero, burning at a slow fire and freezing at the same time with shame and terror."
"“不——不——不——不！”那个讨厌的家伙低声说，“不——不——不，说什么也不行！来吧。”他语气坚决地说，拖着老戈利亚德金先生就往台阶上走。老戈利亚德金先生根本不想去，但大家都在看着他们，继续挣扎和反抗将会很愚蠢。因此，我们主人公去了——不过，真的不能说他进去了，因为他根本不知道自己遭受了什么。不过，这也没什么区别！","“No — no — no — no!” whispered the loathsome person.“No — no — no, on no account!Come along,” he said resolutely, and he dragged Mr. Golyadkin senior to the steps.Mr. Golyadkin senior did not at all want to go, but as every one was looking at them, it would have been stupid to struggle and resist; so our hero went — though, indeed, one cannot say that he went, because he did not know in the least what was being done with him.Though, after all, it made no difference!"
"等我们的主人公恢复过来，头脑清醒后，他发现自己已经在客厅里了。他面色苍白，蓬头垢面，满脸倦容。他用无神的目光扫视了一下人群——太可怕了！客厅里，所有的房间里——到处都挤满了人。人多得不计其数，包括许许多多的女士。所有人都挤在戈利亚德金先生周围，他清楚地察觉到他们把自己朝一个方向挤去。","Before our hero had time to recover himself and come to his senses, he found himself in the drawing-room.He was pale, dishevelled, harassed; with lustreless eyes he scanned the crowd — horror!The drawing-room, all the rooms — were full to overflowing.There were masses of people, a whole galaxy of ladies; and all were crowding round Mr. Golyadkin and he perceived clearly that they were all forcing him in one direction."
"“不是朝门的方向。”戈利亚德金先生脑子里掠过这样的想法。","“Not towards the door,” was the thought that floated through Mr. Golyadkin’s mind."
"的确，他们不是把他朝门口挤，而是朝着奥尔苏菲·伊万诺维奇的安乐椅方向。安乐椅的一边站着克拉拉·奥尔苏菲耶夫娜。她脸色苍白，无精打采，面带忧郁，但身着盛装。她的秀发上插了一朵小白花，这引起了戈利亚德金先生的特别注意。安乐椅的另一边站着弗拉基米尔·谢苗诺维奇，他穿着黑色衣服，纽孔上别着自己新得到的勋章。如我们上面所描述的那样，戈利亚德金先生被领了进来，直接带到了奥尔苏菲·伊万诺维奇跟前——他的一边是装出一副彬彬有礼、举止得体的神情的小戈利亚德金先生；他的另一边是一脸严肃表情的安德雷·菲利波维奇。","They were, in fact, forcing him not towards the door but Olsufy Ivanovitch’s easy chair.On one side of the armchair stood Klara Olsufyevna, pale, languid, melancholy, but gorgeously dressed.Mr. Golyadkin was particularly struck by a little white flower which rested on her superb hair.On the other side of the armchair stood Vladimir Semyonovitch, clad in black, with his new order in his buttonhole.Mr. Golyadkin was led in, as we have described above, straight up to Olsufy Ivanovitch — on one side of him Mr. Golyadkin junior, who had assumed an air of great decorum and propriety, to the immense relief of our hero, while on the other side was Andrey Filippovitch, with a very solemn expression on his face."
"“这些意味着什么？”戈利亚德金先生想。","“What can it mean?”Mr. Golyadkin wondered."
"他看到自己被带去见奥尔苏菲·伊万诺维奇时，一个想法仿佛像一道闪电一样击中了他。他想到那封被截去的信，这个想法闪过他的脑海。我们的主人公万分痛苦地站在奥尔苏菲·伊万诺维奇的椅子前面。","When he saw that he was being led to Olsufy Ivanovitch, an idea struck him like a flash of lightning.The thought of the intercepted letter darted through his brain.In great agony our hero stood before Olsufy Ivanovitch’s chair."
"“他会说什么呢？”他自己想道，“当然，现在一切都要公之于众了，用一种直截了当的方式，或者说可敬的方式。我就说事情是如此这般，等等。”","“What will he say now?” he wondered to himself.“Of course, it will be all aboveboard now, that is, straightforward and, one may say, honourable; I shall say this is how it is, and so on.”"
"但是，我们的主人公明显担心的事情并没有发生。奥尔苏菲·伊万诺维奇非常热情地接待了戈利亚德金先生。虽然他没有伸出手来和戈利亚德金先生握手，但是他看着我们的主人公，摇了摇他那头发灰白、令人肃然起敬的头——带着一种肃穆忧郁，但很友好的神情。至少戈利亚德金先生是这么认为的。他甚至觉得奥尔苏菲·伊万诺维奇无神的眼睛里闪过一滴眼泪。他抬起头，看见站在旁边的克拉拉·奥尔苏菲耶夫娜的睫毛上似乎也挂着泪珠。弗拉基米尔·谢苗诺维奇的眼睛里似乎也一样噙着泪水。一向镇定、沉着自重的安德雷·菲利波维奇也有同大家一起洒下同情之泪的意思。最后，那个看起来极像是位五品文官的青年抓住这个机会，悲痛地抽泣起来……但也许这只是戈利亚德金先生自己的感觉罢了，因为他自己深受感动，分明感觉到热泪正顺着自己的脸颊流下……","But what our hero apparently feared did not happen.Olsufy Ivanovitch received Mr. Golyadkin very warmly, and though he did not hold out his hand to him, yet as he gazed at our hero, he shook his grey and venerable head — shook it with an air of solemn melancholy and yet of goodwill.So, at least, it seemed to Mr. Golyadkin.He even fancied that a tear glittered in Olsufy Ivanovitch’s lustreless eyes; he raised his eyes and saw that there seemed to be tears, too, on the eyelashes of Klara Olsufyevna, who was standing by — that there seemed to be something of the same sort even in the eyes of Vladimir Semyonovitch — that the unruffled and composed dignity of Andrey Filippovitch has the same significance as the general tearful sympathy — that even the young man who was so much like a civil councillor, seizing the opportunity, was sobbing bitterly...Though perhaps this was only all Mr. Golyadkin’s fancy, because he was so much moved himself, and distinctly felt the hot tears running down his cheeks..."
"我们的主人公现在感觉与他人和自己的命运和解了，心里此刻充满了爱，不仅是对奥尔苏菲·伊万诺维奇，也不仅是对聚集在这里的整个人群，甚至也是对那个恶毒的相貌相像者（他现在绝不显得恶毒，而且甚至不是自己的相貌相像者，而是一个与自己完全不相干，本身就和蔼可亲的人）。他声泪俱下，想要对奥尔苏菲·伊万诺维奇表达出自己的感情。但他经历了太多的事情，不能自已，一个字也说不出来。他只能用饱含感情的手势，谦恭地指了指他的心……","Feeling reconciled with mankind and his destiny, and filled with love at the moment, not only for Olsufy Ivanovitch, not only for the whole part collected there, but even for his noxious twin (who seemed now to be by no means noxious, and not even to be his twin at all, but a person very agreeable in himself and in no way connected with him), our hero, in a voice broken with sobs, tried to express his feelings to Olsufy Ivanovitch, but was too much overcome by all that he had gone through, and could not utter a word; he could only, with an expressive gesture, point meekly to his heart..."
"最后，安德雷·菲利波维奇大概不想让老人太伤感，把戈利亚德金先生稍稍拉向一边，但似乎是完全不限制他的自由。我们的主人公微笑着，嘴里喃喃自语，有点不知所措，但几乎完全安于命运，顺应他人，开始从人群中走出去。大家都为他让路，都带着奇怪的好奇心看着他，又露出说不清的神秘的同情。我们的主人公走进另一间屋子。他随处都会遇见相同的注意目光，模模糊糊地觉得整个人群紧跟着他，每走一步都看着他。他们还互相悄声议论着什么有趣的事情，摇着头，低声争辩、讨论。戈利亚德金先生非常想知道他们在低声议论什么。他向四周看看，看到小戈利亚德金先生就在身旁。戈利亚德金先生感到一种不可遏制的冲动，要去抓住他的手，把他拉到一边，专门请求另一位雅科夫·彼得罗维奇一定要在他未来的事业中帮助他，不要在关键时刻丢下他不管。小戈利亚德金先生严肃地点点头，热情地握住了老戈利亚德金先生的手。我们的主人公感情剧烈地整颗心都在颤抖。然而，他喘不过气来了，感觉压抑——非常压抑。他感到所有紧盯着他的目光正压迫着他，控制着他……戈利亚德金先生瞥见了那个戴着假发的文官。那位文官正用严厉的目光看着他，似乎在寻找什么，目光根本没有因为大家的同情而有所缓和……","At last, probably to spare the feelings of the old man, Andrey Filippovitch led Mr. Golyadkin a little away, though he seemed to leave him free to do as he liked.Smiling, muttering something to himself, somewhat bewildered, yet almost completely reconciled with fate and his fellow creatures, our hero began to make his way through the crowd of guests.Every one made way for him, every one looked at him with strange curiosity and with mysterious, unaccountable sympathy.Our hero went into another room; he met with the same attention everywhere; he was vaguely conscious of the whole crowd closely following him, noting every step he took, talking in undertones among themselves of something very interesting, shaking their heads, arguing and discussing in whispers.Mr. Golyadkin wanted very much to know what they were discussing in whispers.Looking round, he saw near him Mr. Golyadkin junior.Feeling an overwhelming impulse to seize his hand and draw him aside, Mr. Golyadkin begged the other Yakov Petrovitch most particularly to co-operate with him in all his future undertakings, and not to abandon him at a critical moment.Mr. Golyadkin junior nodded his head gravely and warmly pressed the hand of Mr. Golyadkin senior.Our hero’s heart was quivering with the intensity of his emotion.He was gasping for breath, however; he felt so oppressed — so oppressed; he felt that all those eyes fastened upon him were oppressing and dominating him ... Mr. Golyadkin caught a glimpse of the councillor who wore a wig.The latter was looking at him with a stern, searching eye, not in the least softened by the general sympathy..."
"我们的主人公拿定主意，要直接走向他，对他微笑，立即对他解释。但不知为什么，他没能这样做。刹那间，戈利亚德金先生几乎失去了意识，几乎失去了所有的记忆和感觉。","Our hero made up his mind to go straight up to him in order to smile at him and have an immediate explanation, but this somehow did not come off.For one instant Mr. Golyadkin became almost unconscious, almost lost all memory, all feeling."
"他再次清醒过来时，发现其他人在他周围围成了一个大圈。突然，隔壁房间有人喊戈利亚德金先生的名字。在一片喧闹和骚动中，大家都涌向第一个房间的门口。我们的主人公几乎是被人群挤过去的。在碰撞中，那个铁石心肠的文官戴着假发，就在戈利亚德金先生旁边。他抓住我们的主人公的手，让他坐在奥尔苏菲·伊万诺维奇对面，不过中间隔了一段距离。屋里的所有人都坐下了。客人被安排成排地围坐在奥尔苏菲·伊万诺维奇和戈利亚德金先生周围。什么声音都没有，大家都保持庄严的沉默。每个人都看着奥尔苏菲·伊万诺维奇，显然在等待什么非同寻常的事情发生。戈利亚德金先生注意到，奥尔苏菲·伊万诺维奇的椅子旁边，正对着那个文官的地方坐着小戈利亚德金先生和安德雷·菲利波维奇。沉默还在继续，他们显然在等待什么。","When he came to himself again he noticed that he was the centre of a large ring formed by the rest of the party round him.Suddenly Mr. Golyadkin’s name was called from the other room; noise and excitement, all rushed to the door of the first room, almost carrying our hero along with them.In the crush the hard-hearted councillor in the wig was side by side with Mr. Golyadkin, and, taking our hero by the hand, he made him sit down opposite Olsufy Ivanovitch, at some distance from the latter, however.Every one in the room sat down; the guests were arranged in rows round Mr. Golyadkin and Olsufy Ivanovitch.Everything was hushed; every one preserved a solemn silence; every one was watching Olsufy Ivanovitch, evidently expecting something out of the ordinary.Mr. Golyadkin noticed that beside Olsufy Ivanovitch’s chair and directly facing the councillor sat Mr. Golyadkin junior, with Andrey Filippovitch.The silence was prolonged; they were evidently expecting something."
"“就像是家里某个人要出远门似的。现在大家要站起来祷告。”我们的主人公想。","“Just as it is in a family when some one is setting off on a far journey.We’ve only to stand up and pray now,” thought our hero."
"突然，大范围的骚动打断了戈利亚德金先生的思考。他们所等待的事情发生了。","Suddenly there was a general stir which interrupted Mr. Golyadkin’s reflections.Something they had been waiting for happened."
"“他来了，他来了！”大家互相转告这个消息。","“He is coming, he is coming!” passed from one to another in the crowd."
"“谁来了？”这个想法掠过戈利亚德金先生的脑海。他突然有种奇怪的感觉，不禁打了个寒颤。“时间到！”文官说，专注地看着安德雷·菲利波维奇。安德雷·菲利波维奇又看了看奥尔苏菲·伊万诺维奇。奥尔苏菲·伊万诺维奇庄严肃穆地点点头。","“Who is it that is coming?” floated through Mr. Golyadkin’s mind, and he shuddered at a strange sensation.“High time too!” said the councillor, looking intently at Andrey Ivanovitch.Andrey Filippovitch, for his part, glanced at Olsufy Ivanovitch.Olsufy Ivanovitch gravely and solemnly nodded his head."
"“起立。”文官喊到，让戈利亚德金先生站起来。所有人都站起来了。然后，这位文官抓住老戈利亚德金先生的手，安德雷·菲利波维奇抓住小戈利亚德金先生。就这样，这两个极其相似的人被拉着穿过周围满心期待的人群。我们的主人公迷惑地看着四周。但是，他突然停住了，注意力集中到了正向他伸出手的小戈利亚德金先生。","“Let us stand up,” said the councillor, and he made Mr. Golyadkin get up.All rose to their feet.Then the councillor took Mr. Golyadkin senior by the hand, and Andrey Filippovitch took Mr. Golyadkin junior, and in this way these two precisely similar persons were conducted through the expectant crowd surrounding them.Our hero looked about him in perplexity; but he was at once checked and his attention was called to Mr. Golyadkin junior, who was holding out his hand to him."
"“他们想让我们和解。”我们的主人公心想。他深情地把自己的手伸向小戈利亚德金先生。然后——然后，他低头向他鞠了一躬。另一个戈利亚德金也做了同样的事情……","“They want to reconcile us,” thought our hero, and with emotion he held out his hand to Mr. Golyadkin junior; and then — then bent his head forward towards him.The other Mr. Golyadkin did the same..."
"这时，老戈利亚德金先生似乎看到他那背信弃义的朋友正在微笑，狡猾地向旁观的人群使了个狡猾的眼色。卑鄙无耻的小戈利亚德金先生脸上有某种险恶的表情，他像犹大一般吻老戈利亚德金先生时还扮了个鬼脸……","At this point it seemed to Mr. Golyadkin senior that his perfidious friend was smiling, that he gave a sly, hurried wink to the crowd of onlookers, and that there was something sinister in the face of the worthless Mr. Golyadkin junior, that he even made a grimace at the moment of his Judas kiss..."
"戈利亚德金先生的耳朵轰轰响，两眼发黑。他觉得有无数个，无尽个系列极其相似的戈利亚德金吵闹着挤在每一个房间的门口。但是已经太迟了……这个背叛的响亮的吻已经结束了，而且……","There was a ringing in Mr. Golyadkin’s ears, and a darkness before his eyes; it seemed to him that an infinite multitude, an unending series of precisely similar Golyadkins were noisily bursting in at every door of the room; but it was too late... the resounding, treacherous kiss was over, and ..."
"这时，一件出乎意料的事情发生了……门开了，发出了很大的噪声。门口出现了一个人。一看见这人，戈利亚德金先生感到一阵冷意。他像在地上生了根似的，一动不动。他惊恐的喊声卡在了嗓子眼儿，像窒息了一般。然而，戈利亚德金先生早就预料到这一切，很久以前就有预感这类事情会发生。这个刚来的人庄严肃穆地朝戈利亚德金先生走来。戈利亚德金先生非常熟悉此人。他之前见过他，而且经常见他，那天就看见他了……此人长得高大结实，穿着黑色的大衣，胸前戴着一个很大的十字架，胡须又黑又浓。他要是再叼一根雪茄，就什么都不缺了。然而，上文已经说过，此人的眼睛把一阵冷意直直刺入戈利亚德金先生的内心。这个可怕的人走向这个故事中可怜的主人公，一副严肃庄重的表情……我们的主人公向他伸出手。这个陌生人抓住他的手，拉着他一起走……我们的主人公看着他，一副心碎和绝望的神情。","Then quite an unexpected event occurred...The door opened noisily, and in the doorway stood a man, the very sight of whom sent a chill to Mr. Golyadkin’s heart.He stood rooted to the spot.A cry of horror died away in his choking throat.Yet Mr. Golyadkin knew it all beforehand, and had had a presentiment of something of the sort for a long time.The new arrival went up to Mr. Golyadkin gravely and solemnly.Mr. Golyadkin knew this personage very well.He had seen him before, had seen him very often, had seen him that day ... This personage was a tall, thick-set man in a black dress-coat with a good-sized cross on his breast, and was possessed of thick, very black whiskers; nothing was lacking but the cigar in the mouth to complete the picture.Yet this person’s eyes, as we have mentioned already, sent a chill to the heart of Mr. Golyadkin.With a grave and solemn air this terrible man approached the pitiable hero of our story...Our hero held out his hand to him; the stranger took his hand and drew him along with him ... With a crushed and desperate air our hero looked about him."
"“这是……这位是克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇·鲁滕什皮茨，医学与外科学博士。你的老熟人，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇！”一个令人厌恶的声音在戈利亚德金先生耳边低声说。戈利亚德金先生扭过头去一看，原来是他那相貌相像者，他内心卑鄙得令人作恶。他脸上现出粗鄙的坏笑，欣喜若狂地搓着双手，欢天喜地地左顾右盼，兴高采烈地奉承每一个人，似乎要高兴地跳起舞来。最后，他跳到前面，从一个仆人手里接过一支蜡烛，走在前面，为戈利亚德金先生和克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇先生引路。戈利亚德金先生听到客厅里所有的人都互相挤着，跟在他们后面。他们都开始跟着戈利亚德金先生重复着说：“这没什么，不要害怕，雅科夫·彼得罗维奇。这是你的老朋友，老相识，你知道，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇·鲁滕什皮茨……”","“It’s ... it’s Krestyan Ivanovitch Rutenspitz, doctor of medicine and surgery; your old acquaintance, Yakov Petrovitch!” a detestable voice whispered in Mr. Golyadkin’s ear.He looked around: it was Mr. Golyadkin’s twin, so revolting in the despicable meanness of his soul.A malicious, indecent joy shone in his countenance; he was rubbing his hands with rapture, he was turning his head from side to side in ecstasy, he was fawning round every one in delight and seemed ready to dance with glee.At last he pranced forward, took a candle from one of the servants and walked in front, showing the way to Mr. Golyadkin and Krestyan Ivanovitch.Mr. Golyadkin heard the whole party in the drawing-room rush after him, crowding and squeezing one another, and all beginning to repeat after Mr. Golyadkin himself, “It is all right, don’t be afraid, Yakov Petrovitch; this is your old friend and acquaintance, you know, Krestyan Ivanovitch Rutenspitz...”"
"最后，他们走出来了，到了灯火通明的台阶上。台阶上也站了一群人。前门砰的打开了，戈利亚德金先生发现自己和克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇站在台阶上。门口停着一辆四匹马拉的马车，马因等得不耐烦而正在打响鼻。恶毒的小戈利亚德金先生跳了三下，飞快地跑下台阶，亲自拉开了马车车门。克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇非常客气地伸出手，请戈利亚德金先生上车。然而，根本就不用这样客气地请他，有许多人帮他上车……戈利亚德金先生回头一看，吓得要晕了。灯火通明的楼梯上挤满了人，好奇的眼睛从四面八方看着他。奥尔苏菲·伊万诺维奇本人也坐在安乐椅上，在上面的平台上饶有兴趣地看着眼前发生的一切。所有人都在等待。戈利亚德金先生回头看的时候，人群中发出一阵不耐烦的低语。","At last they came out on the brightly lighted stairs; there was a crowd of people on the stairs too.The front door was thrown open noisily, and Mr. Golyadkin found himself on the steps, together with Krestyan Ivanovitch.At the entrance stood a carriage with four horses that were snorting with impatience.The malignant Mr. Golyadkin junior in three bounds flew down the stair and opened the carriage door himself.Krestyan Ivanovitch, with an impressive gesture, asked Mr. Golyadkin to get in.There was no need of the impressive gesture, however; there were plenty of people to help him in...Faint with horror, Mr. Golyadkin looked back.The whole of the brightly lighted staircase was crowded with people; inquisitive eyes were looking at him from all sides; Olsufy Ivanovitch himself was sitting in his easy chair on the top landing, and watching all that took place with deep interest.Every one was waiting.A murmur of impatience passed through the crowd when Mr. Golyadkin looked back."
"“我希望我没做什么……没做什么应受指责的事情……或者需要严肃对待的事情……没在公务上做什么引起广泛关注的事情。”我们的主人公绝望地说。周围响起了杂乱的说话声，大家都摇着头。戈利亚德金先生的眼泪涌出了眼眶。","“I hope I have done nothing ... nothing reprehensible ... or that can call for severity ... and general attention in regard to my official relations,” our hero brought out in desperation.A clamour of talk rose all round him, all were shaking their head, tears started from Mr. Golyadkin’s eyes."
"“既然如此，我准备……我有充分的信心……我把我的命运交托给克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇……”","“In that case I’m ready ... I have full confidence ... and I entrust my fate to Krestyan Ivanovitch...”"
"戈利亚德金先生刚宣布他要把自己的命运交托给克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇，所有围在他周围的人就发出了可怕的欢叫声，声音大得震耳欲聋。等候的人群中反复回荡着一阵邪恶的回声。克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇在一边，安德雷·菲利波维奇在另一边帮助戈利亚德金先生上车。他那个相貌相像者还是像往常一样，讨厌地从后面扶他上车。不幸的老戈利亚德金先生回头看了最后一眼，看了看所有的一切，接着就像一只全身被冷水泼了的小猫一样浑身颤抖——如果允许这样打比方的话——钻进了马车。克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇立刻跟了上来。车门砰的一声关上了。鞭子抽在马背上，发出嗖嗖的声音……马车出发了……人群在戈利亚德金先生身后疯狂追赶。他的敌人追赶着他，发出刺耳兴奋的叫声，也算是对他临行的祝福。有几个人跟着载有戈利亚德金先生的马车跑了一段时间。但渐渐地，他们落在了后面，直至最后，他们全都消失了。在后面追赶时间最长的是戈利亚德金先生那个卑鄙无耻的相貌相像者。他把手插在绿色制服的裤兜里，带着得意的神情追赶着。一开始，他从马车的这边跳到马车的那边，有时候抓住窗框，吊在上面，把头伸进窗户，对戈利亚德金先生抛着离别的飞吻。但是，他开始累了。看见他的频率越来越少，最后，他完全消失了。戈利亚德金先生的心隐隐作痛。一股热血冲上他的脑袋，他觉得快要窒息了，想解开扣子——袒露胸膛，让雪落在上面，在上面浇冷水。最后，他陷入了昏迷中……","No sooner had Mr. Golyadkin declared that he entrusted his fate to Krestyan Ivanovitch than a dreadful, deafening shout of joy came from all surrounding him and was repeated in a sinister echo through the whole of the waiting crowd.Then Krestyan Ivanovitch on one side and Andrey Filippovitch on the other helped Mr. Golyadkin into the carriage; his double, in his usual nasty way, was helping to get him in from behind.The unhappy Mr. Golyadkin senior took his last look on all and everything, and, shivering like a kitten that has been drenched with cold water — if the comparison may be permitted — got into the carriage.Krestyan Ivanovitch followed him immediately.The carriage door slammed.There was a swish of the whip on the horses’ backs... the horses started off...The crowd dashed after Mr. Golyadkin.The shrill, furious shouts of his enemies pursued him by way of good wishes for his journey.For some time several persons were still running by the carriage that bore away Mr. Golyadkin; but by degrees they were left behind, till at last they all disappeared.Mr. Golyadkin’s unworthy twin kept up longer than any one.With his hands in the trouser pockets of his green uniform he ran on with a satisfied air, skipping first to one and then to the other side of the carriage, sometimes catching hold of the window-frame and hanging on by it, poking his head in at the window, and throwing farewell kisses to Mr. Golyadkin.But he began to get tired, he was less and less often to be seen, and at last vanished altogether.There was a dull ache in Mr. Golyadkin’s heart; a hot rush of blood set Mr. Golyadkin’s head throbbing; he felt stifled, he longed to unbutton himself — to bare his breast, to cover it with snow and pour cold water on it.He sank at last into forgetfulness..."
"他恢复了神志时，看见马车正拉着他在一条陌生的路上前行。路的两边有一片一片的黑色灌木丛，十分偏僻、荒凉。突然，他几乎要晕倒了。两只火红的眼睛在黑暗中盯着他看。那两只眼睛闪着光，显出邪恶、令人毛骨悚然的高兴。“这不是克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇！这是谁？难道这是他？就是他。这就是克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇，但不是以前那个克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇，而是另一个克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇！这是一个可怕的克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇！”……","When he came to himself, he saw that the horses were taking him along an unfamiliar road.There were dark patches of copse on each side of it; it was desolate and deserted.Suddenly he almost swooned; two fiery eyes were staring at him in the darkness, and those two eyes were glittering with malignant, hellish glee.“That’s not Krestyan Ivanovitch!Who is it?Or is it he?It is.It is Krestyan Ivanovitch, but not the old Krestyan Ivanovitch, it’s another Krestyan Ivanovitch!It’s a terrible Krestyan Ivanovitch!” ..."
"“克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇，我……我相信……我没做错什么，克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇。”我们的主人公胆怯地说，声音颤抖。他希望自己的温顺和服从能够让这个可怕的克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇变得温柔一点。","“Krestyan Ivanovitch, I ... I believe ... I’m all right, Krestyan Ivanovitch,” our hero was beginning timidly in a trembling voice, hoping by his meekness and submission to soften the terrible Krestyan Ivanovitch a little."
"“你会得到一套免费的住处，一片林地，有照明，有仆人，这些你都不配拥有。”克列斯季扬·伊万诺维奇像法官宣判那样用严肃而又可怕的声音回答。","“You get free quarters, wood, with light, and service, the which you deserve not,” Krestyan Ivanovitch’s answer rang out, stern and terrible as a judge’s sentence."
"我们的主人公尖叫了一声，双手抱住了头。天哪！他对此已经早有预感了。","Our hero shrieked and clutched his head in his hands.Alas!For a long while he had been haunted by a presentiment of this."
