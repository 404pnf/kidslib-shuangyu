"The Elf Maiden","精灵姑娘"
"by Andrew Lang","作者：安德鲁·朗格"
"Once upon a time two young men living in a small village fell in love with the same girl.","很久以前，住在一个小村庄里的两个小伙子爱上了同一位姑娘。"
"During the winter, it was all night except for an hour or so about noon, when the darkness seemed a little less dark, and then they used to see which of them could tempt her out for a sleigh ride with the Northern Lights flashing above them, or which could persuade her to come to a dance in some neighbouring barn.","那里的冬天都是漫漫长夜，只有正午的一个小时左右，黑夜似乎才没有那么黑。于是他们总是在那时看谁能把姑娘约出来，在他们头顶闪耀的北极光下滑雪橇，或者看是他们谁能邀请她去某个临近的谷仓跳舞。"
"But when the spring began, and the light grew longer, the hearts of the villagers leapt at the sight of the sun, and a day was fixed for the boats to be brought out, and the great nets to be spread in the bays of some islands that lay a few miles to the north.","但是当春天来临时，白昼变长了，村民们见到太阳便满心欢喜起来，于是大家定好日子一起出海，前往北方几英里外的岛屿的海湾撒网捕鱼。"
"Everybody went on this expedition, and the two young men and the girl went with them.","全村人都出海了，包括那两个小伙子和他们心爱的姑娘。"
"They all sailed merrily across the sea chattering like a flock of magpies, or singing their favourite songs.","他们一路欢歌笑语越过大海，像一群喜鹊那样叽叽喳喳地聊着天，不时唱着他们最喜欢的歌谣。"
"And when they reached the shore, what an unpacking there was!","抵达海滨后，大家都在忙着搬运各种用品，好不热闹！"
"For this was a noted fishing ground, and here they would live, in little wooden huts, till autumn and bad weather came round again.","这是一个远近闻名的捕鱼场，他们要在这里的小木屋里住到秋天，等寒冬来临前才离开。"
"The maiden and the two young men happened to share the same hut with some friends, and fished daily from the same boat.","那位姑娘恰巧和两个小伙子以及一些朋友被分在了同一间小屋，并且他们每天用同一艘船捕鱼。"
"And as time went on, one of the youths remarked that the girl took less notice of him than she did of his companion.","随着时间的推移，其中一个小伙子发现那位姑娘对他的注意力比对他同伴的要少一些。"
"At first he tried to think that he was dreaming, and for a long while he kept his eyes shut very tight to what he did not want to see, but in spite of his efforts, the truth managed to wriggle through, and then the young man gave up trying to deceive himself, and set about finding some way to get the better of his rival.","起初，他极力劝说自己这不过是错觉，很长一段时间里，他对自己不想看到的都视而不见。然而事实又明摆着，想不承认都难。最终，小伙子终于放弃自欺欺人，而开始去寻找击败对手的方法。"
"The plan that he hit upon could not be carried out for some months; but the longer the young man thought of it, the more pleased he was with it, so he made no sign of his feelings, and waited patiently till the moment came.","他突然有了一个计划，然而实施却要等上好几个月。他越想越得意，但是表面丝毫不动声色，耐心地等待那一刻的到来。"
"This was the very day that they were all going to leave the islands, and sail back to the mainland for the winter.","这一天，他们全都要离开海岛，返回大陆过冬。"
"In the bustle and hurry of departure, the cunning fisherman contrived that their boat should be the last to put off, and when everything was ready, and the sails about to be set, he suddenly called out:","临走前，在忙乱之中，那个狡猾的渔民小伙子故意让他们的船最后一个离开，当一切都准备妥当即将起航时，他突然大叫："
"‘Oh, dear, what shall I do!","“哎呀，该怎么办！"
"I have left my best knife behind in the hut.","我把我最好的刀落在小屋了。"
"Run, like a good fellow, and get it for me, while I raise the anchor and loosen the tiller.’","好兄弟，去跑一趟，帮我拿来吧，我先起锚，调转船。”"
"Not thinking any harm, the youth jumped back on shore and made his way up the steep hank.","小伙子没有多想，立即跳回到岸上，爬上陡坡。"
"At the door of the hut he stopped and looked back, then started and gazed in horror.","在小屋的门边他停了下来，回头一看，当时就被吓得目瞪口呆。"
"The head of the boat stood out to sea, and he was left alone on the island.","船头驶向了大海，他被孤零零地抛在了海岛上。"
"Yes, there was no doubt of it—he was quite alone; and he had nothing to help him except the knife which his comrade had purposely dropped on the ledge of the window.","岛上就他一人——是的，这点毫无疑问。除了同伴故意留在窗户边的刀，他没有任何工具可用。"
"For some minutes he was too stunned by the treachery of his friend to think about anything at all, but after a while he shook himself awake, and determined that he would manage to keep alive somehow, if it were only to revenge himself.","朋友突然的背信弃义，让小伙子简直气晕了，他头脑一片空白，但是过了一会儿，他用力晃了晃脑袋，逐渐清醒过来，并发誓一定要活下去，即使只是为了报仇。"
"So he put the knife in his pocket and went off to a part of the island which was not so bare as the rest, and had a small grove of trees.","他把刀放在口袋里，前往岛上的一小片树林，那里不像岛的其他地方那样光秃秃的。"
"From one of these he cut himself a bow, which he strung with a piece of cord that had been left lying about the huts.","他砍下一个树枝做成一张弓，用在小屋周围留下的一根绳子做弦。"
"When this was ready the young man ran down to the shore and shot one or two sea-birds, which he plucked and cooked for supper.","等这些准备就绪，年轻人跑到海边，射下两只海鸟，他拔掉它们的羽毛，做了晚餐。"
"In this way the months slipped by, and Christmas came round again.","就这样，几个月过去了，又要到圣诞节了。"
"The evening before, the youth went down to the rocks and into the copse, collecting all the drift wood the sea had washed up or the gale had blown down, and he piled it up in a great stack outside the door, so that he might not have to fetch any all the next day.","圣诞前夜，小伙子走到礁石间，然后走进小灌木丛来收集海水冲上来的木头或大风吹过来的树枝，他在门外堆了一大堆，这样第二天他就不用再去拣了。"
"As soon as his task was done, he paused and looked out towards the mainland, thinking of Christmas Eve last year, and the merry dance they had had.","他的事情一做完，便停下来，朝大陆方向望去，想起了去年的圣诞节前夕，还有他们跳的欢快的舞蹈。"
"The night was still and cold, and by the help of the Northern Lights he could almost see across to the opposite coast, when, suddenly, he noticed a boat, which seemed steering straight for the island.","黑夜寂静而寒冷，在北极光的照射下，他几乎可以看到对岸。这时，他突然发现一艘船正向小岛笔直驶来。"
"At first he could hardly stand for joy, the chance of speaking to another man was so delightful; but as the boat drew near there was something, he could not tell what, that was different from the boats which he had been used to all his life, and when it touched the shore he saw that the people that filled it were beings of another world than ours.","起初，他几乎不能承受这样的喜悦，能和另一个人说话是多么令人高兴；然而当船靠近时，他觉得有些不对劲，自己同渔船打了一辈子交道，可这条渔船看着不太像本地船，也说不清哪里不一样。而当它靠岸时，他看到上面满是和我们不同的另一个世界的人。"
"Then he hastily stepped behind the wood stack, and waited for what might happen next.","于是，他赶紧躲在了木材堆后面，等着看接下来会发生什么。"
"The strange folk one by one jumped on to the rocks, each bearing a load of something that they wanted.","这伙陌生人一个接一个地跳上礁石，每个人都带着大量所需物品。"
"Among the women he remarked two young girls, more beautiful and better dressed than any of the rest, carrying between them two great baskets full of provisions.","在女人中间，他发现两个姑娘比其他人更漂亮、穿得更好看，她们两个人抬着两个装满粮食的大篮子。"
"The young man peeped out cautiously to see what all this crowd could be doing inside the tiny hut, but in a moment he drew back again, as the girls returned, and looked about as if they wanted to find out what sort of a place the island was.","年轻人小心地探出来，偷偷地四处张望，看这群人在小小的屋子里能干什么。然而他再退回来时，碰巧姑娘们折了回来，四处察看，似乎是想看看自己是来到了一个什么样的海岛。"
"Their sharp eyes soon discovered the form of a man crouching behind the bundles of sticks, and at first they felt a little frightened, and started as if they would run away.","姑娘们眼尖，立刻发现蹲在柴堆后面的人形，一开始她们还有些害怕，准备好要逃跑。"
"But the youth remained so still, that they took courage and laughed gaily to each other.","但是那个小伙子一动也不动，这反而让她们壮起了胆子，相互咯咯地笑了起来。"
"‘What a strange creature, let us try what he is made of,’ said one, and she stooped down and gave him a pinch.","“多奇怪的人啊，让我们看看他是用什么做的。”一位姑娘说着，她走过来弯下腰，拧了一下小伙子。"
"Now the young man had a pin sticking in the sleeve of his jacket, and the moment the girl’s hand touched him she pricked it so sharply that the blood came.","没想到，小伙子的衣袖上碰巧有一枚别针，姑娘的手一碰就扎破了，流出了鲜血。"
"The girl screamed so loudly that the people all ran out of their huts to see what was the matter.","姑娘一声尖叫，人们都赶紧从他们的小屋里跑出来，看发生了什么事。"
"But directly they caught sight of the man they turned and fled in the other direction, and picking up the goods they had brought with them scampered as fast as they could down to the shore.","然而一看到小伙子，他们就立刻掉头回屋，收拾了他们带来的东西，便飞快地奔向海边。"
"In an instant, boat, people, and goods had vanished completely.","眨眼工夫，船、人群和他们的东西一起消失得无影无踪。"
"In their hurry they had, however, forgotten two things: a bundle of keys which lay on the table, and the girl whom the pin had pricked, and who now stood pale and helpless beside the wood stack.","然而，在匆忙中，他们落下了两样东西：放在桌上的一串钥匙和被别针戳到的姑娘，可怜的姑娘面色苍白，无助地立在柴火堆旁。"
"‘You will have to make me your wife,’ she said at last, ‘for you have drawn my blood, and I belong to you.’","“你必须得娶我，”她终于开口说，“你让我流了血，所以我就属于你了。”"
"‘Why not?","“娶就娶，为什么不呢？"
"I am quite willing,’ answered he.","我倒是很愿意，”他回答，"
"‘But how do you suppose we can manage to live till summer comes round again?’","“只是你怎么就认定我们能熬到夏天呢？”"
"‘Do not be anxious about that,’ said the girl; ‘if you will only marry me all will be well.","“这个用不着担心，”姑娘说，“只要你愿意娶我，一切都会好起来的。"
"I am very rich, and all my family are rich also.’","我非常有钱，我家里也很富裕。”"
"Then the young man gave her his promise to make her his wife, and the girl fulfilled her part of the bargain, and food was plentiful on the island all through the long winter months, though he never knew how it got there.","于是，小伙子承诺娶她，而姑娘也说到做到，一整个漫长的冬季，他们都有丰富的食物，然而他从不知道食物是哪里来的。"
"And by-and-by it was spring once more, and time for the fisher-folk to sail from the mainland.","不久以后，春天又来临了，又到了大陆渔民出海捕鱼的时节。"
"‘Where are we to go now?’ asked the girl, one day, when the sun seemed brighter and the wind softer than usual.","一天，太阳似乎格外明媚，风也格外轻柔，姑娘问小伙子：“我们现在去哪儿呢？”"
"‘I do not care where I go,’ answered the young man; ‘what do you think?’","“我去哪儿无所谓，”小伙子回答，“你觉得呢？”"
"The girl replied that she would like to go somewhere right at the other end of the island, and build a house, far away from the huts of the fishing-folk.","姑娘说想去海岛的另一端，在那里建一座房子，离渔民的这些小屋远远的。"
"And he consented, and that very day they set off in search of a sheltered spot on the banks of a stream, so that it would be easy to get water.","他也同意，当天，他们离开小屋，在小溪的岸边找到了一个僻静的地方，那里取水特别方便。"
"In a tiny bay, on the opposite side of the island they found the very thing, which seemed to have been made on purpose for them; and as they were tired with their long walk, they laid themselves down on a bank of moss among some birches and prepared to have a good night’s rest, so as to be fresh for work next day.","在海岛背面的小海湾，他们发现这里的一切都好像是特意为他们准备的，他们走了很长的路，也累了，就躺在白桦树下的一行青苔上，打算好好休息一晚上，这样明天工作才能精力充沛。"
"But before she went to sleep the girl turned to her husband, and said: ‘If in your dreams you fancy that you hear strange noises, be sure you do not stir, or get up to see what it is.’","临睡前，姑娘对她的丈夫说：“如果你在睡梦中感觉听到了奇怪的声响，千万别动，也别起来看。”"
"‘Oh, it is not likely we shall hear any noises in such a quiet place,’ answered he, and fell sound asleep.","“噢，我们在这么僻静的地方，不太可能有什么响动的。”说完，小伙子就进入了酣睡。"
"Suddenly he was awakened by a great clatter about his ears, as if all the workmen in the world were sawing and hammering and building close to him.","突然他被耳边嘈杂的声音吵醒了，仿佛全世界的工匠都聚集在他附近，拉锯、挥锤、修建房子。"
"He was just going to spring up and go to see what it meant, when he luckily remembered his wife’s words and lay still.","他正要起身看个究竟，幸好想起妻子的嘱咐，便一动不动地躺着。"
"But the time till morning seemed very long, and with the first ray of sun they both rose, and pushed aside the branches of the birch trees.","早晨前的时间似乎过得很慢，伴随着清晨的第一缕阳光，他们都起来了，接着推开白桦树的树枝。"
"There, in the very place they had chosen, stood a beautiful house—doors and windows, and everything all complete!","就在他们选好了准备建房子的地方，立起一座美丽的房子——有门有窗，一应俱全！"
"‘Now you must fix on a spot for your cow-stalls,’ said the girl, when they had breakfasted off wild cherries; ‘and take care it is the proper size, neither too large nor too small.’","“现在你得找个地方盖奶牛棚，”他们吃完野樱桃的早餐后，姑娘说，“而且要注意大小合适，不要太大，也不要太小。”"
" And the husband did as he was bid, though he wondered what use a cow-house could be, as they had no cows to put in it.","丈夫按照吩咐做了，只是他想知道家里没有一头奶牛，要奶牛棚做什么。"
"But as he was a little afraid of his wife, who knew so much more than he, he asked no questions.","但是，他有一点儿害怕自己的妻子，因为她见多识广，比他自己强多了。"
"This night also he was awakened by the same sounds as before, and in the morning they found, near the stream, the most beautiful cow-house that ever was seen, with stalls and milk-pails and stools all complete, indeed, everything that a cow-house could possibly want, except the cows.","这一晚，他又被之前一样的声音吵醒了，早上起来一看，小溪边又盖起来了一座奶牛棚，他从没见过这么漂亮的奶牛棚，畜栏、牛奶桶、样样齐全的各种工具，确实是应有尽有，就是没有奶牛。"
"Then the girl bade him measure out the ground for a storehouse, and this, she said, might be as large as he pleased; and when the storehouse was ready she proposed that they should set off to pay her parents a visit.","随后，姑娘又吩咐他测量出谷仓需要的地，还说，想盖多大都可以。谷仓建好以后，她提议去拜访一下她的父母。"
"The old people welcomed them heartily, and summoned their neighbours, for many miles round, to a great feast in their honour.","老人热情地迎接他们，并召集方圆几英里的邻居们都来参加为他们举办的宴会。"
"In fact, for several weeks there was no work done on the farm at all; and at length the young man and his wife grew tired of so much play, and declared that they must return to their own home.","事实上，农场上有好几周都没活可干。后来，小伙子和他的妻子终于玩腻了，决定返回自己的家。"
"But, before they started on the journey, the wife whispered to her husband: ‘Take care to jump over the threshold as quick as you can, or it will be the worse for you.’","然而，在他们启程之前，妻子小声对她的丈夫说：“出门时，要尽快跳过门槛，否则你就遭殃了。”"
"The young man listened to her words, and sprang over the threshold like an arrow from a bow; and it was well he did, for, no sooner was he on the other side, than his father-in-law threw a great hammer at him, which would have broken both his legs, if it had only touched them.","小伙子听了她的话，像离弦的箭一样跳过了门槛。他干得很好，因为刚跳过去，他的岳父就向他扔了一个大锤子，如果锤子打到了他的双腿，他的双腿早就被砸断了。"
"When they had gone some distance on the road home, the girl turned to her husband and said: ‘Till you step inside the house, be sure you do not look back, whatever you may hear or see.’","他们走在回家的路上时，姑娘对他说：“从现在开始，直到你踏进家门前，不管你听到什么，看到什么，千万不要回头。”"
"And the husband promised, and for a while all was still; and he thought no more about the matter till he noticed at last that the nearer he drew to the house the louder grew the noise of the trampling of feet behind him.","丈夫答应了，好长一段时间，路上一直静悄悄的，于是他也没再多想，直到最后，他越接近房子，他身后传来的沉重的脚步声就越响。"
"As he laid his hand upon the door he thought he was safe, and turned to look.","当他把手放在门上，觉得自己已经安全了，他忍不住回头看了一眼。"
"There, sure enough, was a vast herd of cattle, which had been sent after him by his father-in-law when he found that his daughter had been cleverer than he.","天啊，身后的的确确是好大一群奶牛，原来是他的岳父见女儿比他精明，特意送给他们，让牛跟在他后面。"
"Half of the herd were already through the fence and cropping the grass on the banks of the stream, but half still remained outside and faded into nothing, even as he watched them.","有一半的牛群都已经跨过了栅栏，在小溪边吃着青草。但是，就在小伙子看到它们的一刹那，栅栏外的牛渐渐消失不见了。"
"However, enough cattle were left to make the young man rich, and he and his wife lived happily together, except that every now and then the girl vanished from his sight, and never told him where she had been.","不过，留下的奶牛也足够了，小两口过着富裕美满的日子。然而，美中不足的是，每隔一段时间，姑娘总会不辞而别，而且从不告诉小伙子她去了哪里。"
"For a long time he kept silence about it; but one day, when he had been complaining of her absence, she said to him: ‘Dear husband, I am bound to go, even against my will, and there is only one way to stop me.","小伙子一直憋了好久，直到一天，他实在忍不住了，便向妻子抱怨她的不辞而别，姑娘告诉他：“亲爱的丈夫，我也不愿意，但又非去不可，要想不让我去，只有一个办法。"
"Drive a nail into the threshold, and then I can never pass in or out.’","就是把一颗钉子钉在门槛里，这样我就不能进来也不能出去了。”"
"And so he did.","小伙子也确实这么做了。"
