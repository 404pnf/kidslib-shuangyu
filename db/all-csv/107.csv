"绝境","A Predicament"
"作者：艾伦·坡","By Edgar Allan Poe"
"是什么意外，美丽的姑娘，让你如此孤苦凄凉？——《科摩斯》","What chance, good lady, hath bereft you thus?—COMUS."
"那是一个安静平和的下午，我在美丽的爱丁纳城街头散步。街上熙熙攘攘，一片混乱，很是糟糕。男人们在聊天。女人们在嚷嚷。孩子们在哭泣。猪在嚎叫。马车嘎吱嘎吱地响。公牛在怒吼。母牛在低哞。马在嘶叫。猫在叫春。狗在跳舞。跳舞！这在当时可能吗？跳舞！唉！我想，我跳舞的日子已经过去了！就那样永远过去了。在那些有天资、充满想象、擅长沉思的人心中，多少令人沮丧的记忆会不时地被唤醒，尤其是在有天资的人心中。他们的心注定要受到无尽的、永恒的、接连的影响，或许有人会说连续的——是的，连续不断的、痛苦的、烦人的、令人不安、非常令人不安（如果我可以这样说的话）的影响，注定要受到那种可以说是最令人羡慕、确确实实最令人羡慕的事物的影响——不！应该说是世上最美妙宜人、精妙有趣，实际上也最漂亮别致（如果我可以用这样大胆的表达的话）的事物（原谅我，温和的读者），可是我总是无法控制自己的感情。这样的事物会产生宁静神圣、超凡脱俗、庄严崇高的影响，有净化心灵的作用。我再重复一遍，在这样一颗心中，一点琐事就能够激起多少的回忆！狗跳舞！我——我却不能！它们跳跃——我哭泣。它们雀跃——我大声啜泣。多么伤感的情景啊！这不会不让古典文学的读者触景生情，回忆起那段优美的描写，那段描写可以在绝妙、古老的中国小说Jo-Go-Slow第三卷的卷首找到。（注：此处Jo-Go-Slow是女主人公对“How to Write a Blackwood Article”一文中提到的Ju-Kiao-Li的误写，Ju-Kiao-Li指《玉娇梨》。）","IT was a quiet and still afternoon when I strolled forth in the goodly city of Edina.The confusion and bustle in the streets were terrible.Men were talking.Women were screaming.Children were choking.Pigs were whistling.Carts they rattled.Bulls they bellowed.Cows they lowed.Horses they neighed.Cats they caterwauled.Dogs they danced.Danced!Could it then be possible?Danced!Alas, thought I, my dancing days are over!Thus it is ever.What a host of gloomy recollections will ever and anon be awakened in the mind of genius and imaginative contemplation, especially of a genius doomed to the everlasting and eternal, and continual, and, as one might say, the—continued—yes, the continued and continuous, bitter, harassing, disturbing, and, if I may be allowed the expression, the very disturbing influence of the serene, and godlike, and heavenly, and exalted, and elevated, and purifying effect of what may be rightly termed the most enviable, the most truly enviable—nay! the most benignly beautiful, the most delicious ethereal, and, as it were, the most pretty (if I may use so bold an expression) thing (pardon me, gentle reader!) in the world—but I am always led away by my feelings. In such a mind, I repeat, what a host of recollections are stirred up by a trifle!The dogs danced!I—I could not!They frisked—I wept.They capered—I sobbed aloud.Touching circumstances! which cannot fail to bring to the recollection of the classical reader that exquisite passage in relation to the fitness of things, which is to be found in the commencement of the third volume of that admirable and venerable Chinese novel the Jo-Go-Slow."
"当我独自在那座城市行走时，我有两位卑微但忠诚的伴侣相伴。黛安娜，我的鬈毛狗！最可爱的动物！它的一只眼睛被很多毛给遮住了，脖子上系着一根蓝色的缎带，看上去很时髦。黛安娜的身高不超过五英寸，可是它的头比身子稍大一点。它的尾巴剪得极短，这给了它一副受到伤害的天真模样，使这有趣的小动物成了所有人的最爱。","In my solitary walk through the city I had two humble but faithful companions.Diana, my poodle! sweetest of creatures!She had a quantity of hair over her one eye, and a blue riband tied fashionably around her neck.Diana was not more than five inches in height, but her head was somewhat bigger than her body, and her tail being cut off exceedingly close, gave an air of injured innocence to the interesting animal which rendered her a favorite with all."
"还有庞培，我的黑伙伴！可爱的庞培！我怎么能忘记你呢？我曾经拉过庞培的手臂。他身高三英尺（我喜欢事事都说得详细精确），年龄大约七八十岁。他是个“罗圈腿”，长得胖胖的。他的嘴不能说小，耳朵也不能说短。但是，他的牙齿像珍珠；他又大又圆的眼睛有着美丽的白色。大自然没有赐予他脖子，还让他的脚踝（和那个种族的通常情况一样）长在脚背的中间。他的穿着惊人地简单。他唯一的衣物就是一条九英寸宽的大硬领圈和一件几乎全新的浅褐色大衣，那件大衣以前的主人是高大威严、名声显赫的莫尼彭尼博士。那是一件很好的大衣。裁剪得很好。制作也精细。大衣还几乎是全新的。庞培用两只手拿住衣边，不让它粘到泥。","And Pompey, my negro!—sweet Pompey! how shall I ever forget thee?I had taken Pompey’s arm.He was three feet in height (I like to be particular) and about seventy, or perhaps eighty, years of age.He had bow-legs and was corpulent.His mouth should not be called small, nor his ears short.His teeth, however, were like pearl, and his large full eyes were deliciously white.Nature had endowed him with no neck, and had placed his ankles (as usual with that race) in the middle of the upper portion of the feet.He was clad with a striking simplicity.His sole garments were a stock of nine inches in height, and a nearly-new drab overcoat which had formerly been in the service of the tall, stately, and illustrious Dr. Moneypenny.It was a good overcoat.It was well cut.It was well made.The coat was nearly new.Pompey held it up out of the dirt with both hands."
"我们一共是三位，有两位已经介绍过了。还有第三位——那个人就是我。我是普叙赫·泽诺比娅女士。我不是萨基·斯洛比斯。我看起来很威严。在我所说的那个难忘的场合，我穿着一件深红色的缎子连衣裙，披一件天蓝色的阿拉伯小斗篷。裙子上装饰着绿色的搭扣，还有七道橘色的报春花形状的荷叶边，非常优雅。我就这样成了三个人中的第三位。有鬈毛狗。有庞培。还有我自己。我们是三位。据说，复仇女神最初也是三位——墨耳提、尼密和赫蒂，即沉思、记忆和演奏。（注：此处是女主人公对“How to Write a Blackwood Article”一文中提到的缪斯女神的误写，原文为“There were originally but three Muses—Melete, Mneme, Aoede—meditation, memory, and singing”，大意为“缪斯女神最初只有三位——墨勒忒、莫涅墨和阿俄伊德，即沉思、记忆和唱歌”。）","There were three persons in our party, and two of them have already been the subject of remark.There was a third—that person was myself.I am the Signora Psyche Zenobia.I am not Suky Snobbs.My appearance is commanding.On the memorable occasion of which I speak I was habited in a crimson satin dress, with a sky-blue Arabian mantelet.And the dress had trimmings of green agraffes, and seven graceful flounces of the orange-colored auricula.I thus formed the third of the party.There was the poodle.There was Pompey.There was myself.We were three.Thus it is said there were originally but three Furies—Melty, Nimmy, and Hetty—Meditation, Memory, and Fiddling."
"我靠着勇武的庞培的胳膊，黛安娜远远地陪着我。现在爱丁纳已经荒废了，但昔日这些街道热热闹闹、生气勃勃，我们沿着其中一条街道往前走。突然，一座教堂映入眼帘——一座哥特式大教堂，雄伟庄严，高高的尖塔直插云霄。当时是怎样一种疯狂控制住了我？我为什么向我的命运猛冲过去？我被一种难以控制的欲望所支配，想要登上那令人眩晕的尖顶，然后俯瞰这座广阔无边的城市。教堂的门开着，充满了诱惑。命运之神战胜了我。我走进了那道不祥的拱门。当时我的守护天使在哪里？如果真的存在那样的天使。如果！多么令人痛苦的词啊！在你的两个字里，包含着一个多么神秘莫测、意味深长、充满怀疑和变数的世界！我走进了那道不祥的拱门！我进去了，并没有损坏我的橘色报春花；我从正门下面经过，出现在教堂的前厅里。据说，浩渺的艾尔弗雷德河从海底穿过时，也没有受到损伤，没有被弄湿。（注：river Alfred是女主人公对“How to Write a Blackwood Article”一文中提到的river Alpheus的误写，原文指阿尔斐俄斯河。）","Leaning upon the arm of the gallant Pompey, and attended at a respectable distance by Diana, I proceeded down one of the populous and very pleasant streets of the now deserted Edina.On a sudden, there presented itself to view a church—a Gothic cathedral—vast, venerable, and with a tall steeple, which towered into the sky.What madness now possessed me?Why did I rush upon my fate?I was seized with an uncontrollable desire to ascend the giddy pinnacle, and then survey the immense extent of the city.The door of the cathedral stood invitingly open.My destiny prevailed.I entered the ominous archway.Where then was my guardian angel?—if indeed such angels there be.If!Distressing monosyllable! what world of mystery, and meaning, and doubt, and uncertainty is there involved in thy two letters!I entered the ominous archway!I entered; and, without injury to my orange-colored auriculas, I passed beneath the portal, and emerged within the vestibule.Thus it is said the immense river Alfred passed, unscathed, and unwetted, beneath the sea."
"我认为那楼梯从未有过尽头。旋梯！是的，它们往上旋啊，旋啊，旋啊，直到我情不自禁地猜测——和睿智的庞培一起，由于对之前建立起来的感情完全有信心，我便靠在他坚实的臂膀上——我情不自禁地猜测，那延绵不断的旋梯的顶部已经被人无意中给挪走了，或许是有人故意把它挪走了。我停下来呼吸，就在此时，一件事情发生了，这件事情无论从道德准则还是形而上学的角度来看，都是重大事件，以至于无法对它视而不见。在我看来是这样——其实我深信这个事实——我不会弄错的——不会！我仔细、焦虑地观察着黛安娜的举动，已经有一会儿了——我说我不会弄错——黛安娜闻到了一只老鼠！我立刻把这个情况告诉了庞培，他赞同我的判断。这样就没有什么理由怀疑了。那只老鼠已被闻到，并且是被黛安娜闻到的。天哪！我怎么能忘记那一刻无比激动的心情？唉！人类自吹的才智是什么？那只老鼠！它就在那里，也就是说，它就在某个地方。黛安娜闻到了老鼠。而我——我却闻不到！据说，普鲁士鸳尾对一些人来说具有怡人而极浓烈的芳香，而对另外一些人来说却没有一点香味。（注：Prussian Isis是女主人公对“How to Write a Blackwood Article”一文中提到的Persian Iris的误写，原文指波斯的鸢尾。 ）","I thought the staircase would never have an end.Round!Yes, they went round and up, and round and up and round and up, until I could not help surmising, with the sagacious Pompey, upon whose supporting arm I leaned in all the confidence of early affection—I could not help surmising that the upper end of the continuous spiral ladder had been accidentally, or perhaps designedly, removed.I paused for breath; and, in the meantime, an accident occurred of too momentous a nature in a moral, and also in a metaphysical point of view, to be passed over without notice.It appeared to me—indeed I was quite confident of the fact—I could not be mistaken—no!I had, for some moments, carefully and anxiously observed the motions of my Diana—I say that I could not be mistaken—Diana smelt a rat!At once I called Pompey’s attention to the subject, and he—he agreed with me.There was then no longer any reasonable room for doubt.The rat had been smelled—and by Diana.Heavens! shall I ever forget the intense excitement of the moment?Alas! what is the boasted intellect of man?The rat!—it was there—that is to say, it was somewhere.Diana smelled the rat.I—I could not!Thus it is said the Prussian Isis has, for some persons, a sweet and very powerful perfume, while to others it is perfectly scentless."
"旋梯已经被征服了，如今塔尖与我们之间只隔着三四级台阶。我们继续攀登，现在只剩下一级台阶了。一级台阶！短短的、小小的一级台阶！在人生这架巨大的旋梯上，这一级小小的台阶决定了人类多少的幸福或苦难。我想到了我自己，接着想到了庞培，接着想到了围绕着我们的神秘莫测、无法解释的命运。我想到了庞培！唉，我想到了爱！我想到了自己已经迈出、并可能再次迈出的错误的一步步。我决定以后更加小心，更加矜持。我离开了庞培的臂膀，在没有他的帮助的情况下，登上了最后那一级台阶，到达了塔顶的钟楼。我的鬈毛狗也紧跟着我上来了。庞培独自一人在后面。我站在旋梯顶端，鼓励他登上来。他把手伸向我，不幸的是，这样一来，他就不得不放开他一直紧紧拿着的衣边。众神从不停止他们对人的迫害吗？大衣垂了下去，庞培的一只脚踩住了垂下来的长长的大衣下摆。他被绊倒了——这后果是无法避免的。他人往前倾，那该死的头刚好撞在——撞在我的胸部上，结果我和他一起一头栽在了钟楼坚硬、肮脏、可恨的地板上。但是我的报复是肯定的，而且是出其不意、非常彻底的。我非常生气地用两只手抓住他的鬈毛，扯下很多又黑又弯又卷的东西，然后带着显而易见的蔑视把它扔了出去。它掉在了钟楼的绳索之间，并留在了那里。庞培爬了起来，什么也没说。但是他用他那双大眼睛可怜兮兮地看着我——叹了口气。众神啊——那声叹息！它渐渐进入了我的心扉。那头发——那浓密鬈发！如果我够得到那绺头发的话，我会用我的泪水清洗它，来证明我的后悔。但是，唉！它现在离得很远，我根本抓不到。由于它在大钟的绳索间摇摆，我想象它仍然还活着。我想象它正非常生气地直立着。据说，爪哇岛有一种兰花会开美丽的花朵，被连根拔起也还能活着。（注：happy-dandy Flos Aeris是女主人公对“How to Write a Blackwood Article”一文中提到的Epidendrum Flos Aeris一词的误写，Eqidendrum Flos Aeris指兰花的一种。）当地人用绳子把它悬挂在天花板上，常年享受它的芳香。","The staircase had been surmounted, and there were now only three or four more upward steps intervening between us and the summit.We still ascended, and now only one step remained.One step!One little, little step!Upon one such little step in the great staircase of human life how vast a sum of human happiness or misery depends!I thought of myself, then of Pompey, and then of the mysterious and inexplicable destiny which surrounded us.I thought of Pompey!—alas, I thought of love!I thought of my many false steps which have been taken, and may be taken again.I resolved to be more cautious, more reserved.I abandoned the arm of Pompey, and, without his assistance, surmounted the one remaining step, and gained the chamber of the belfry.I was followed immediately afterward by my poodle.Pompey alone remained behind.I stood at the head of the staircase, and encouraged him to ascend.He stretched forth to me his hand, and unfortunately in so doing was forced to abandon his firm hold upon the overcoat.Will the gods never cease their persecution?The overcoat is dropped, and, with one of his feet, Pompey stepped upon the long and trailing skirt of the overcoat.He stumbled and fell—this consequence was inevitable.He fell forward, and, with his accursed head, striking me full in the—in the breast, precipitated me headlong, together with himself, upon the hard, filthy, and detestable floor of the belfry.But my revenge was sure, sudden, and complete.Seizing him furiously by the wool with both hands, I tore out a vast quantity of black, and crisp, and curling material, and tossed it from me with every manifestation of disdain.It fell among the ropes of the belfry and remained.Pompey arose, and said no word.But he regarded me piteously with his large eyes and—sighed.Ye Gods—that sigh!It sunk into my heart.And the hair—the wool!Could I have reached that wool I would have bathed it with my tears, in testimony of regret.But alas! it was now far beyond my grasp.As it dangled among the cordage of the bell, I fancied it alive.I fancied that it stood on end with indignation.Thus the happy-dandy Flos Aeris of Java bears, it is said, a beautiful flower, which will live when pulled up by the roots.The natives suspend it by a cord from the ceiling and enjoy its fragrance for years."
"现在争吵已经平息，我们环顾了一下这个房间，想找一个小缺口，好俯瞰爱丁纳城。这里一扇窗都没有。在这个幽暗的房间里，唯一的光线是透过一个方洞照进来的，这个洞大约一英尺见方，离地大约七英尺。可是，对于真正的天才而言，什么目的无法达到？我决定爬上那个洞口。洞的对面，有很多轮子、齿轮和其他看上去很神秘的机械装置，它们都离洞口很近；这些装置中，有一根铁棒穿过了方洞。在轮子和有洞的那道墙之间几乎容不下我的身体，可是我已孤注一掷，决定坚持下去。我把庞培叫到身边。","Our quarrel was now made up, and we looked about the room for an aperture through which to survey the city of Edina.Windows there were none.The sole light admitted into the gloomy chamber proceeded from a square opening, about a foot in diameter, at a height of about seven feet from the floor.Yet what will the energy of true genius not effect?I resolved to clamber up to this hole.A vast quantity of wheels, pinions, and other cabalistic-looking machinery stood opposite the hole, close to it; and through the hole there passed an iron rod from the machinery.Between the wheels and the wall where the hole lay there was barely room for my body—yet I was desperate, and determined to persevere.I called Pompey to my side."
"“你看那个洞，庞培。我想从那儿向外望。你就站在这儿，站在洞下面——就这样。现在，把你的一只手伸出来，庞培，让我踩在它上面——就这样。现在，另一只手，庞培，有了这只手，我就可以爬上你的肩膀了。”","“You perceive that aperture, Pompey.I wish to look through it.You will stand here just beneath the hole—so.Now, hold out one of your hands, Pompey, and let me step upon it—thus.Now, the other hand, Pompey, and with its aid I will get upon your shoulders.”"
"他按我的意思一一做了，我站在他肩膀上，发现很容易就能把头和脖子伸到洞外面去。景色美丽极了。没有比这更壮观的了。我只停了一小会儿，吩咐黛安娜安分点，并向庞培保证我会很体贴，会尽量轻地站在他的肩上。我告诉他，我会顾及他的感情——像牛排一样嫩的感情。（注：ossi tender que beefsteak是女主人公对“How to Write a Blackwood Article”一文中提到的aussi tendre que Zaire的误用，原文指像莎伊尔一般娇嫩。）公平地处理好我忠诚的朋友之后，我就开始带着极大的兴趣和热情享受起美景来，这片美景热心地将自己呈现在我眼前。","He did every thing I wished, and I found, upon getting up, that I could easily pass my head and neck through the aperture.The prospect was sublime.Nothing could be more magnificent.I merely paused a moment to bid Diana behave herself, and assure Pompey that I would be considerate and bear as lightly as possible upon his shoulders.I told him I would be tender of his feelings—ossi tender que beefsteak.Having done this justice to my faithful friend, I gave myself up with great zest and enthusiasm to the enjoyment of the scene which so obligingly spread itself out before my eyes."
"然而，对于这一点，我必须忍住不去详述。我将不会描述爱丁堡城。每个人都到过爱丁堡城。每个人都到过爱丁堡——历史名城爱丁纳。我将只叙述我自己那次糟糕的冒险中的重要细节。在一定程度上，自己对那座城市的大小、位置和概貌的好奇心得到了满足，然后我就不紧不慢地审视着我所在的教堂以及尖顶那精美的建筑。我发现，我把头伸出去的那个洞是一面巨钟的钟面上的一个孔，从街道上看，肯定就像一个大大的钥匙孔，正如我们在法国表的表面上看到的那样。无疑，这方洞真正的用途是让一名杂役能把手伸出去，在必要的时候从内部调整钟的指针。我还惊奇地发现，那些指针很大，最长的那根绝不低于十英尺，最宽的地方有八九英寸。它们明显是用实心的钢制成的，边缘看上去很锋利。注意到这些和其他一些细节之后，我再次把目光转向了下面壮观的景色，并且很快陷入了沉思。","Upon this subject, however, I shall forbear to dilate.I will not describe the city of Edinburgh.Every one has been to the city of Edinburgh.Every one has been to Edinburgh—the classic Edina.I will confine myself to the momentous details of my own lamentable adventure.Having, in some measure, satisfied my curiosity in regard to the extent, situation, and general appearance of the city, I had leisure to survey the church in which I was, and the delicate architecture of the steeple.I observed that the aperture through which I had thrust my head was an opening in the dial-plate of a gigantic clock, and must have appeared, from the street, as a large key-hole, such as we see in the face of the French watches.No doubt the true object was to admit the arm of an attendant, to adjust, when necessary, the hands of the clock from within.I observed also, with surprise, the immense size of these hands, the longest of which could not have been less than ten feet in length, and, where broadest, eight or nine inches in breadth.They were of solid steel apparently, and their edges appeared to be sharp.Having noticed these particulars, and some others, I again turned my eyes upon the glorious prospect below, and soon became absorbed in contemplation."
"几分钟后，庞培的声音把我从沉思中唤醒，他说他撑不下去了，并请我体谅一下，从他肩上下来。这不合情理；我说了一通，把这一点告诉他。他回答了，但是显然误解了我对这个问题的看法。于是我生气了，明确地告诉他，他是一个笨蛋，他犯了ignoramus e-clench-eye的错误，他的想法不过是insommary Bovis，而他的话比ennemywerrybor'em好不了多少。（注：ignoramus e-clench-eye，insommary Bovis和emmemywerrybor'em分别是“How to Write a Blackwood Article”一文中提到的三个拉丁词的错误拼写，正确的拼法应为ignoratio elenchi，insomnia Jovis和anemonae verborum。committee an ignoratio elenchi的意思是“只明白了字眼，却不懂其中的意思”；insomnia Jovis指朱庇特的幻想，比喻浮夸的思想；anemonae verborum指银莲花般的话语，银莲花花朵鲜艳，却没有香味，这个短语比喻华而不实的话。）这下他似乎满意了，我又继续沉思。","From this, after some minutes, I was aroused by the voice of Pompey, who declared that he could stand it no longer, and requested that I would be so kind as to come down.This was unreasonable, and I told him so in a speech of some length.He replied, but with an evident misunderstanding of my ideas upon the subject.I accordingly grew angry, and told him in plain words, that he was a fool, that he had committed an ignoramus e-clench-eye, that his notions were mere insommary Bovis, and his words little better than an ennemywerrybor’em.With this he appeared satisfied, and I resumed my contemplations."
"争吵完之后大约过了半小时，当我正深深地沉浸在我下面那天堂般的美景中时，我被吓了一跳，一个非常冰冷的东西轻柔地压在我的后颈上。不用说，我感到一种难以言表的恐慌。我知道庞培在我的脚下，黛安娜按照我的明确指示正蹲在这个房间最远的角落里。那这是什么呢？天哪！还好我发现得早。把头轻轻转向一侧，我极其恐惧地发现，那每小时转一圈、庞大闪亮的、刀一样的分针已经架在了我的脖子上。我知道要争分夺秒了。我立即把脖子缩回来，可是已经太迟了。让我的头从那个可怕的陷阱中退出来已经不可能了，头不偏不倚正好陷在里面，而陷阱的口正以无法想象的可怕速度变得越来越小。当时的那种痛苦无法想象。我举起双手，用尽全力将那沉重的铁棒往上推。可能我试图把教堂本身也举起来。分针在往下，往下，往下，离得越来越近。我向庞培呼喊求救，但是他说我称他为“无知的老斜眼”伤害了他的感情。我向黛安娜求救，可是它只是“汪汪”叫，意思是说，我已经叫它“绝不要离开那个角落。”因此我不能指望从同伴那获得援助了。","It might have been half an hour after this altercation when, as I was deeply absorbed in the heavenly scenery beneath me, I was startled by something very cold which pressed with a gentle pressure on the back of my neck.It is needless to say that I felt inexpressibly alarmed.I knew that Pompey was beneath my feet, and that Diana was sitting, according to my explicit directions, upon her hind legs, in the farthest corner of the room.What could it be?Alas!I but too soon discovered.Turning my head gently to one side, I perceived, to my extreme horror, that the huge, glittering, scimitar-like minute-hand of the clock had, in the course of its hourly revolution, descended upon my neck.There was, I knew, not a second to be lost.I pulled back at once—but it was too late.There was no chance of forcing my head through the mouth of that terrible trap in which it was so fairly caught, and which grew narrower and narrower with a rapidity too horrible to be conceived.The agony of that moment is not to be imagined.I threw up my hands and endeavored, with all my strength, to force upward the ponderous iron bar.I might as well have tried to lift the cathedral itself.Down, down, down it came, closer and yet closer.I screamed to Pompey for aid; but he said that I had hurt his feelings by calling him ‘an ignorant old squint-eye.’ I yelled to Diana; but she only said ‘bow-wow-wow,’ and that I had told her ‘on no account to stir from the corner.’Thus I had no relief to expect from my associates."
"同时，那把沉重而可怕的“时间镰刀”（我现在明白了这个古典词组的原意）没有停止，也不可能在前进的过程中停止。它仍然在一点一点地往下压。它那锋利的边缘已经切入我的脖子足足一英寸，我的感觉变得模糊而混乱。我一会儿想象自己正在费城与庄重的莫理本利博士在一起，一会儿又想象自己在布莱克伍德先生的后客厅里倾听他无价的教导。接着，我又记起了先前更加美好的时光，那些甜蜜的回忆；我回味着那段快乐的时光，那时候这个世界并不是一片荒原，庞培也没有这么残忍。","Meantime the ponderous and terrific Scythe of Time (for I now discovered the literal import of that classical phrase) had not stopped, nor was it likely to stop, in its career.Down and still down, it came.It had already buried its sharp edge a full inch in my flesh, and my sensations grew indistinct and confused.At one time I fancied myself in Philadelphia with the stately Dr. Moneypenny, at another in the back parlor of Mr. Blackwood receiving his invaluable instructions.And then again the sweet recollection of better and earlier times came over me, and I thought of that happy period when the world was not all a desert, and Pompey not altogether cruel."
"那机械装置发出的滴答声让我快乐。我说它让我快乐是因为，此刻我的感觉已经接近极乐的状态，最微不足道的小事也足以令我欣喜。大钟那永无止境的滴答、滴答、滴答的声音在我的耳里就是最动人的音乐，有时甚至让我想起奥拉波德博士得体的布道演说。接着钟面上出现了许多伟大的身影，他们看上去多么聪明、多么有智慧啊！现在他们开始跳玛祖卡舞，我认为跳得最令我满意的是身影V。那明显是一位有教养的女士。完全没有你们的那种趾高气扬，她的舞姿也毫无不雅之处。她的单足旋转令人羡慕——踮起脚尖旋转。我竭力搬给她一张椅子，因为我看出她似乎跳得精疲力竭了，直到这时我才彻底意识到自己可悲的处境。确实是可悲！那分针切入我的脖子已经有两英寸。我被一种剧烈的疼痛唤醒。我祈求死去，在这一痛苦的时刻，我情不自禁地反复吟起诗人塞万提斯的那几行精美的诗句：","The ticking of the machinery amused me.Amused me, I say, for my sensations now bordered upon perfect happiness, and the most trifling circumstances afforded me pleasure.The eternal click-clack, click-clack, click-clack of the clock was the most melodious of music in my ears, and occasionally even put me in mind of the graceful sermonic harangues of Dr. Ollapod.Then there were the great figures upon the dial-plate—how intelligent, how intellectual, they all looked!And presently they took to dancing the Mazurka, and I think it was the figure V. who performed the most to my satisfaction.She was evidently a lady of breeding.None of your swaggerers, and nothing at all indelicate in her motions.She did the pirouette to admiration—whirling round upon her apex.I made an endeavor to hand her a chair, for I saw that she appeared fatigued with her exertions—and it was not until then that I fully perceived my lamentable situation.Lamentable indeed!The bar had buried itself two inches in my neck.I was aroused to a sense of exquisite pain.I prayed for death, and, in the agony of the moment, could not help repeating those exquisite verses of the poet Miguel De Cervantes:"
"快来吧，死神，","Vanny Buren, tan escondida"
"但别让我看见你到来，","Query no te senty venny"
"以免我见到你时的快乐","Pork and pleasure, delly morry"
"会不幸地让我死而复活！（注：此处是女主人公对“How to Write a Blackwood Articale”一文中提到的四行诗的误写，正确的原文应为：Van muerte tan escondida, Que no te sienta venir,Porque el plazer del morir,No mestorne a dar la vida。）","Nommy, torny, darry, widdy!"
"但是现在一种新的恐惧出现了，事实上这一恐惧足以让最坚强的神经吓一跳。由于那机器的残酷压力，我的眼珠完全从眼窝中鼓了出来。当我在想失去它们以后该怎么办时，一只眼珠实际上从我的眼窝中迸了出来，顺着尖塔陡峭的外墙，滚进了沿主建筑的屋檐延伸出来的雨槽中。与其说是我失去了眼睛，还不如说是这只眼睛获得了独立，它以无礼而且鄙视的眼神看着我。它躺在雨槽里，刚好在我鼻子底下，那副神情如果说不上恶心的话，至少也是可笑的。以前从没见它这样眨过。雨槽中那只眼睛的行为让我很恼火，因为它表现出了明显的傲慢无礼和可耻的忘恩负义，而且也让我感到很不方便，因为一个脑袋上的两只眼睛无论相距多远，彼此之间总是会存在感应。不论我愿意与否，都不得不在一定程度上眨眨眼睛，与躺在我鼻子下面的那个下流坯子保持高度一致。然而，现在另一只眼珠也掉了，我解脱了。下落的时候，它选择了和同伴一样的方向（可能是共同策划的阴谋）。它们一起滚出了雨槽，实际上我很高兴能摆脱它们。","But now a new horror presented itself, and one indeed sufficient to startle the strongest nerves.My eyes, from the cruel pressure of the machine, were absolutely starting from their sockets.While I was thinking how I should possibly manage without them, one actually tumbled out of my head, and, rolling down the steep side of the steeple, lodged in the rain gutter which ran along the eaves of the main building.The loss of the eye was not so much as the insolent air of independence and contempt with which it regarded me after it was out.There it lay in the gutter just under my nose, and the airs it gave itself would have been ridiculous had they not been disgusting.Such a winking and blinking were never before seen.This behavior on the part of my eye in the gutter was not only irritating on account of its manifest insolence and shameful ingratitude, but was also exceedingly inconvenient on account of the sympathy which always exists between two eyes of the same head, however far apart.I was forced, in a manner, to wink and to blink, whether I would or not, in exact concert with the scoundrelly thing that lay just under my nose.I was presently relieved, however, by the dropping out of the other eye.In falling it took the same direction (possibly a concerted plot) as its fellow.Both rolled out of the gutter together, and in truth I was very glad to get rid of them."
"现在，那指针切入我脖子的深度已经有四英寸半，脖子上只剩下一层皮和脑袋相连。我的感觉是完全的快乐，因为我感到再过几分钟，最多几分钟，我就可以从这令人不快的处境中解脱了。我的这个希望并没有落空。下午五点二十五分整，那庞大的分针在它可怕的轨道上转了足够长的时间后，最终切断了我脖子上最后那点儿跟脑袋连着的部分。看见曾让我如此尴尬的脑袋最终与我的身体分离，我并没有难过。它先沿着尖塔的外壁滚下去，接着在雨槽中停了几秒，最后纵身一跃，掉到了大街中间。","The bar was now four inches and a half deep in my neck, and there was only a little bit of skin to cut through.My sensations were those of entire happiness, for I felt that in a few minutes, at farthest, I should be relieved from my disagreeable situation.And in this expectation I was not at all deceived.At twenty-five minutes past five in the afternoon, precisely, the huge minute-hand had proceeded sufficiently far on its terrible revolution to sever the small remainder of my neck.I was not sorry to see the head which had occasioned me so much embarrassment at length make a final separation from my body.It first rolled down the side of the steeple, then lodge, for a few seconds, in the gutter, and then made its way, with a plunge, into the middle of the street."
"我要坦率地承认，我现在的感觉带有一种最奇特的性质，而且是最神秘、最复杂、最难以理解的性质。在同一时刻，我的感觉既在这儿，又在那儿。我一会儿用我的脑袋设想，我的脑袋是真正的普叙赫·泽诺比娅小姐——一会儿我又相信，我的身体才是自己本来的身份。为了弄清我对这一问题的想法，我到口袋里去摸鼻烟盒，可是当我摸到它，努力按平常的方式使用一小撮令人快乐的烟末时，我马上意识到我特殊的缺陷，并立刻把鼻烟盒扔给了我的脑袋。它极其满意地吸了一小撮，接着向我笑了笑表示感谢。紧接着它对我说了一番话，我能够听见，但是由于没有耳朵，我未能听清。然而，我听到的内容足以让我知道，它对我在这种情况下居然还想继续活下去感到很惊讶。在结束语中，它引用了阿里奥斯托的高贵的诗句——","I will candidly confess that my feelings were now of the most singular—nay, of the most mysterious, the most perplexing and incomprehensible character.My senses were here and there at one and the same moment.With my head I imagined, at one time, that I, the head, was the real Signora Psyche Zenobia—at another I felt convinced that myself, the body, was the proper identity.To clear my ideas on this topic I felt in my pocket for my snuff-box, but, upon getting it, and endeavoring to apply a pinch of its grateful contents in the ordinary manner, I became immediately aware of my peculiar deficiency, and threw the box at once down to my head.It took a pinch with great satisfaction, and smiled me an acknowledgement in return.Shortly afterward it made me a speech, which I could hear but indistinctly without ears.I gathered enough, however, to know that it was astonished at my wishing to remain alive under such circumstances.In the concluding sentences it quoted the noble words of Ariosto—"
"Il pover hommy che non sera corty","Il pover hommy che non sera corty"
"And have a combat tenty erry morty;（注：这两行诗是女主人公对“How to Write a Blackwood Article”一文中提到的那两行诗的误写，原文为：Il pover 'huomo che non se'n era accorto, Andava combattendo, e era morto。意思是说，一位伟大的英雄在战斗最激烈的时候没有意识到自己已被杀死，所以仍继续战斗。）","And have a combat tenty erry morty;"
"以此把我比作诗中的那位英雄，他在激烈的战斗中并没有感觉到自己已经死了，继续以不灭的勇气战斗。现在已经没有什么能够阻碍我从高处下来了，我也确实这样做了。我一直都无法知道，庞培从我的外表中看到了什么非常特别的地方。这家伙张大了嘴，紧闭他的双眼，似乎正在努力用上下眼皮夹坚果似的。最后，他扔掉大衣，跃向楼梯，然后就消失了。我向那个无赖恶狠狠地骂出了德摩斯梯尼那句有力的话——","thus comparing me to the hero who, in the heat of the combat, not perceiving that he was dead, continued to contest the battle with inextinguishable valor.There was nothing now to prevent my getting down from my elevation, and I did so.What it was that Pompey saw so very peculiar in my appearance I have never yet been able to find out.The fellow opened his mouth from ear to ear, and shut his two eyes as if he were endeavoring to crack nuts between the lids.Finally, throwing off his overcoat, he made one spring for the staircase and disappeared.I hurled after the scoundrel these vehement words of Demosthenes—"
"安德鲁·奥菲勒格森，你果真仓皇出逃了。","Andrew O’Phlegethon, you really make haste to fly."
"接着我转向了我的心肝宝贝，只有一只眼睛、毛发蓬乱的黛安娜。天哪！我的眼前是一副多么恐怖的景象！那偷偷摸摸正在进洞的是一只老鼠吗？这些是那只大老鼠残忍地吞吃掉小天使后，剔下的残骨吗？天哪！难道我所看到的——是我心爱的鬈毛狗的亡魂、幽灵、鬼魂？我还认为它正忧伤地、优雅地蹲坐在墙脚。听！它在诉说，天哪！它在用德语吟诵席勒的诗句——","and then turned to the darling of my heart, to the one-eyed! the shaggy-haired Diana.Alas! what a horrible vision affronted my eyes?Was that a rat I saw skulking into his hole?Are these the picked bones of the little angel who has been cruelly devoured by the monster?Ye gods! and what do I behold—is that the departed spirit, the shade, the ghost, of my beloved puppy, which I perceive sitting with a grace so melancholy, in the corner?Hearken! for she speaks, and, heavens! it is in the German of Schiller—"
"假若我死去，至少我是","Unt stubby duk, so stubby dun"
"为你而死！为你而死！（注：这原指“How to Write a Blackwood Article”一文中出现的诗句，女主人公在引用时，出现了错误的拼写，原文应为：Und sterb'ich doch, no sterb'ich dennDurch sie—durch sie!）","Duk she!duk she!"
"天啊！它所说的话不是太真实了吗？","Alas! and are not her words too true?"
"如果我死了，至少我是","And if I died, at least I died"
"为你而死——为你而死。","For thee—for thee."
"亲爱的小狗！它也为我牺牲了它自己。没有了狗，没有了黑人，没有了头，现在不高兴的普叙赫·泽诺比娅小姐还有什么？天哪——一无所有！我完蛋了。","Sweet creature! she too has sacrificed herself in my behalf.Dogless, niggerless, headless, what now remains for the unhappy Signora Psyche Zenobia?Alas—nothing!I have done."
