"德利斯图梅雷侯爵夫人是那些沐浴着复辟精神成长起来的年轻的少妇之一。她品行端正，虔诚斋戒，参加圣礼，衣着优雅地去参加舞会、观看歌剧；她的告解神父允许她把世俗和神圣结合起来。她总是遵照教会规定和社会准则，展示了像是以“合法”为座右铭的当代社会的真实生活场景。侯爵夫人的行为准确地反映了她既笃信宗教——足以表现出和路易十四垂危之际的曼特农夫人一样的凄楚、悲切的虔诚，同时又十分世俗——能够适应路易十四统治初期对女子大献殷勤的风尚，若这些风尚可以再次兴起的话。现在，她非常注意自己的操守。这可能是出于心计，也可能是出于个人喜好，七年前她嫁给了一位想要跻身贵族的议员——德利斯图梅雷侯爵。她或许也想到和侯爵结婚会有助于实现她的家族野心。一些妇人对她的看法都有所保留，直到德利斯图梅雷先生成为一个法国贵族，她们的观点才有所改变。那时候，侯爵夫人也将36岁了——在生命的这个阶段，许多妇人会发现她们自己都被社会法则欺骗了。","The Marquise de Listomere is one of those young women who have been brought up in the spirit of the Restoration.She has principles, she fasts, takes the sacrament, and goes to balls and operas very elegantly dressed; her confessor permits her to combine the mundane with sanctity.Always in conformity with the Church and with the world, she presents a living image of the present day, which seems to have taken the word “legality” for its motto.The conduct of the marquise shows precisely enough religious devotion to attain under a new Maintenon to the gloomy piety of the last days of Louis XIV., and enough worldliness to adopt the habits of gallantry of the first years of that reign, should it ever be revived.At the present moment she is strictly virtuous from policy, possibly from inclination.Married for the last seven years to the Marquis de Listomere, one of those deputies who expect a peerage, she may also consider that such conduct will promote the ambitions of her family.Some women are reserving their opinion of her until the moment when Monsieur de Listomere becomes a peer of France, when she herself will be thirty-six years of age,—a period of life when most women discover that they are the dupes of social laws."
