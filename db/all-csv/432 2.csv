"Little Thumb","","小拇指"
"by Andrew Lang","","作者：安德鲁•朗格"
"There was, once upon a time, a man and his wife fagot-makers by trade, who had several children, all boys.","","从前，有一对夫妻以砍柴为生，他们有几个孩子，全是男孩。"
"The eldest was but ten years old, and the youngest only seven.","","最大的孩子不过十岁，最小的一个也只有七岁。"
"They were very poor, and their seven children incommoded them greatly, because not one of them was able to earn his bread.","","他们家里很穷，七个孩子更是让他们的生活雪上加霜，因为没有一个孩子能够自己养活自己。"
"That which gave them yet more uneasiness was that the youngest was of a very puny constitution, and scarce ever spoke a word, which made them take that for stupidity which was a sign of good sense.","","不过，更让他们发愁的是那个最小的孩子。他体格很瘦弱，几乎不怎么说话，这让他们认为这孩子脑袋笨，而这正是他聪明的表现。"
"He was very little, and when born no bigger than one’s thumb, which made him be called Little Thumb.","","他长得十分矮小，出生时还没有人的拇指大，于是人们叫他“小拇指”。"
"The poor child bore the blame of whatsoever was done amiss in the house, and, guilty or not, was always in the wrong; he was, notwithstanding, more cunning and had a far greater share of wisdom than all his brothers put together; and, if he spake little, he heard and thought the more.","","这个可怜的孩子要承担家里所有的过错，而且不管是不是他的错，他都得承担。尽管如此，他比哥哥们都机敏，他的智慧甚至比所有哥哥们的智慧加起来还要多得多。此外，虽然他说的少，但他听的和想的多。"
"There happened now to come a very bad year, and the famine was so great that these poor people resolved to rid themselves of their children.","","恰逢荒年来到，饥荒很严重，逼得那些穷人们决定抛弃自己的孩子。"
"One evening, when they were all in bed and the fagot-maker was sitting with his wife at the fire, he said to her, with his heart ready to burst with grief:","","一天晚上，孩子们都上床后，樵夫和妻子坐到炉火旁。他怀着极其悲伤的心情对妻子说："
"“Thou seest plainly that we are not able to keep our children, and I cannot see them starve to death before my face; I am resolved to lose them in the wood to-morrow, which may very easily be done; for, while they are busy in tying up fagots, we may run away, and leave them, without their taking any notice.”","","“你也明白，我们没有能力养活自己的孩子，但我不能眼睁睁看着他们饿死。我决定明天把他们扔在树林里，这应该不难办到，因为我们可以在他们忙着捆柴火时跑开，趁他们不注意的时候把他们留在那里。”"
"“Ah!” cried his wife; “and canst thou thyself have the heart to take thy children out along with thee on purpose to lose them?”","","“啊！”他的妻子大声嚷道，“你怎么忍心故意把自己的孩子们带出去扔掉呢？”"
"In vain did her husband represent to her their extreme poverty: she would not consent to it; she was indeed poor, but she was their mother.","","不管丈夫如何向她解释家里多么贫困，都是白费口舌，她仍不同意抛弃孩子。她确实很穷，但她是孩子们的妈妈呀。"
"However, having considered what a grief it would be to her to see them perish with hunger, she at last consented, and went to bed all in tears.","","然而，想到看着孩子们饿死该是多么痛苦，她最终还是同意了，然后泪水涟涟地上床睡觉去了。"
"Little Thumb heard every word that had been spoken; for observing, as he lay in his bed, that they were talking very busily, he got up softly, and hid himself under his father’s stool, that he might hear what they said without being seen.","","小拇指听到了他们说的每一句话。当时他躺在床上，而父母正谈得起劲。为了便于偷听，他轻轻从床上起身，躲在爸爸坐的凳子下面，好听到父母的谈话，还不被他们发现。"
"He went to bed again, but did not sleep a wink all the rest of the night, thinking on what he had to do.","","他重新回到床上，可剩下的大半夜他睡意全无，满脑子只想着自己该怎么办。"
"He got up early in the morning, and went to the river-side, where he filled his pockets full of small white pebbles, and then returned home.","","第二天早上，他早早起床后便去了河边，捡了些白色的小鹅卵石装满了他的口袋，之后返回家里。"
"They all went abroad, but Little Thumb never told his brothers one syllable of what he knew.","","全家人都出了门，但关于他所知道的秘密，小拇指一个字也没告诉哥哥们。"
"They went into a very thick forest, where they could not another at ten paces distance.","","他们走进一片十分茂密的森林，在那里，人们只要相隔十步就看不见对方了。"
"The fagot-maker began to cut wood, and the children to gather up the sticks to make fagots.","","樵夫开始砍柴，孩子们则捡树枝来当柴火。"
"Their father and mother, seeing them busy at their work, got away from them insensibly, and ran away from them all at once, along a by-way through the winding bushes.","","爸爸妈妈见他们忙着拾柴火，就慢慢地从他们身边走开，然后立马丢下他们，穿过婆娑的灌木丛，沿着一条小道跑去。"
"When the children saw they were left alone, they began to cry as loud as they could.","","当孩子们发现自己被扔下后，开始扯着嗓子哭了起来。"
"Little Thumb let them cry on, knowing very well how to get home again, for, as he came, he took care to drop all along the way the little white pebbles he had in his pockets.","","小拇指任凭他们一直哭，因为他知道怎样找到重新回家的路。在来的路上，他沿路细心地丢下了他口袋里装的白色小鹅卵石。"
"Then he said to them:","","于是他对哥哥们说："
"“Be not afraid, brothers; father and mother have left us here, but I will lead you home again, only follow me.”","","“哥哥们，不要害怕。虽然爸爸妈妈把我们留在了这里，但我会重新带你们回家的，你们只要跟着我就行了。”"
"They did so, and he brought them home by the very same way they came into the forest.","","哥哥们听从了他的话。小拇指带着他们顺着来到森林的那条路回到了家。"
"They dared not go in, but sat themselves down at the door, listening to what their father and mother were saying.","","他们不敢进家门，只是坐在家门口，听爸爸妈妈在说什么。"
"The very moment the fagot-maker and his wife reached home the lord of the manor sent them ten crowns, which he had owed them a long while, and which they never expected.","","就在樵夫和妻子回到家的时候，庄园主给他们送来了十克朗。那是庄园主欠了他们很久的钱，他们从没想到能收回来。"
"This gave them new life, for the poor people were almost famished.","","在这对贫苦的夫妻快要饿死的时候，这笔钱又让他们活过来了。"
"The fagot-maker sent his wife immediately to the butcher’s.","","樵夫马上就吩咐妻子去肉店。"
"As it was a long while since they had eaten a bit, she bought thrice as much meat as would sup two people.","","他们好长时间都没吃过一口肉了，所以她买的肉是两个人食量的三倍。"
"When they had eaten, the woman said:","","他们吃完后，女人说道："
"“Alas! where are now our poor children? they would make a good feast of what we have left here; but it was you, William, who had a mind to lose them: I told you we should repent of it.","","“啊！我可怜的孩子们现在在哪里？我们剩下的食物能让他们美美吃上一顿了。不过，这都怪你，威廉，是你要扔掉他们的。我跟你说过，我们会后悔的。"
"What are they now doing in the forest?","","他们现在在森林里做什么呢？"
"Alas! dear God, the wolves have perhaps already eaten them up; thou art very inhuman thus to have lost thy children.”","","哦！亲爱的上帝，也许他们已经全被狼吃掉了。你真是狠心啊，居然扔掉自己的亲生孩子。”"
"The fagot-maker grew at last quite out of patience, for she repeated it above twenty times, that they should repent of it, and that she was in the right of it for so saying.","","樵夫最终变得很不耐烦了，因为她一遍又一遍地说他们会为此而后悔的。那些话她重复说了20多遍，而且她说的确实有理。"
"He threatened to beat her if she did not hold her tongue.","","他威胁她说，如果她再不住口，就要揍她。"
"It was not that the fagot-maker was not, perhaps, more vexed than his wife, but that she teased him, and that he was of the humor of a great many others, who love wives to speak well, but think those very importunate who are continually doing so.","","这并不是因为樵夫不懊恼，也许他比妻子更为懊恼，而是因为妻子惹恼了他。他和许多人一样，喜欢口才好的妻子，但如果像她这样唠叨个不停，他就觉得十分讨厌了。"
"She was half-drowned in tears, crying out:","","她眼泪汪汪地大声喊道："
"“Alas! where are now my children, my poor children?”","","“哎呀！我可怜的孩子们，你们现在在哪里？”"
"She spoke this so very loud that the children, who were at the gate, began to cry out all together:","","她说得非常大声，门口的孩子们听见了。于是他们开始一起大叫了起来："
"“Here we are!","","“我们在这里！"
"Here we are!”","","我们在这里！”"
"She ran immediately to open the door, and said, hugging them:","","她立刻跑去开门，一边拥抱孩子们，一边说："
"“I am glad to see you, my dear children; you are very hungry and weary; and my poor Peter, thou art horribly bemired; come in and let me clean thee.”","","“很高兴能重新见到你们，我亲爱的孩子们。你们饿了吧？累了吧？我可怜的彼得，你看你浑身脏兮兮的。过来，我来给你洗洗。”"
"Now, you must know that Peter was her eldest son, whom she loved above all the rest, because he was somewhat carroty, as she herself was.","","现在你一定知道了，彼得是她的长子，也是所有孩子中她最宠爱的一个，因为彼得的头发和她的一样，泛着红棕色。"
"They sat down to supper, and ate with such a good appetite as pleased both father and mother, whom they acquainted how frightened they were in the forest, speaking almost always all together.","","他们坐下来吃晚饭，爸爸妈妈看见他们吃得那么香，感到心满意足。他们几乎异口同声地告诉父母他们在森林里的时候有多害怕。"
"The good folks were extremely glad to see their children once more at home, and this joy continued while the ten crowns lasted; but, when the money was all gone, they fell again into their former uneasiness, and resolved to lose them again; and, that they might be the surer of doing it, to carry them to a much greater distance than before.","","这对夫妇看到自己的孩子重新回到家中，特别开心。在十克朗花光之前，这种快乐都一直持续着。但是，当这些钱全花光的时候，他们又陷入了往日的惴惴不安中，于是他们决定再次将孩子们抛弃。为了让计划万无一失，他们打算把孩子送到比上次远得多的地方。"
"They could not talk of this so secretly but they were overheard by Little Thumb, who made account to get out of this difficulty as well as the former; but, though he got up very early in the morning to go and pick up some little pebbles, he was disappointed, for he found the house-door double-locked, and was at a stand what to do.","","他们悄悄地商量着这件事，但被小拇指偷听到了。他打算像上次一样脱离困境。但是，尽管他早上起了个大早，准备去捡些鹅卵石，计划还是落空了，因为他发现家门被锁了两道，这让他一时不知所措。"
"When their father had given each of them a piece of bread for their breakfast, Little Thumb fancied he might make use of this instead of the pebbles by throwing it in little bits all along the way they should pass; and so he put the bread in his pocket.","","爸爸分给他们一人一片面包当早饭，这时小拇指想着可以用面包屑来代替鹅卵石，沿路撒在他们走过的路上。于是他把面包放进了自己的口袋。"
"Their father and mother brought them into the thickest and most obscure part of the forest, when, stealing away into a by-path, they there left them.","","爸爸妈妈把他们带到森林里一处树木最茂密、光线最昏暗的地方，然后从一条岔道溜走了，只留下他们在那里。"
"Little Thumb was not very uneasy at it, for he thought he could easily find the way again by means of his bread, which he had scattered all along as he came; but he was very much surprised when he could not find so much as one crumb; the birds had come and had eaten it up, every bit.","","小拇指并没有为此而太担心。他认为自己能再次轻松地找到回家的路，因为他沿路撒了面包屑。但让他非常惊讶的是，他连一点儿面包屑也没找到。鸟儿飞来把面包屑统统给吃光了。"
"They were now in great affliction, for the farther they went the more they were out of their way, and were more and more bewildered in the forest.","","此时他们极度苦恼，因为他们越往前走，就越找不到路，在森林里就越不知道该怎么办。"
"Night now came on, and there arose a terribly high wind, which made them dreadfully afraid.","","此时夜幕降临，一阵狂风猛袭过来，孩子们恐惧极了。"
"They fancied they heard on every side of them the howling of wolves coming to eat them up.","","他们想象着四周传来了狼的嗷叫声，像是要来把他们吃光似的。"
"They scarce dared to speak or turn their heads.","","他们几乎不敢说话，也不敢转头。"
"After this, it rained very hard, which wetted them to the skin; their feet slipped at every step they took, and they fell into the mire, whence they got up in a very dirty pickle; their hands were quite benumbed.","","接着，天空下起了大雨，他们里里外外都湿了个透。他们每走一步，都会滑倒在泥潭里，然后又满身污泥地爬起来再走。他们的双手都冻僵了。"
"Little Thumb climbed up to the top of a tree, to see if he could discover anything; and having turned his head about on every side, he saw at last a glimmering light, like that of a candle, but a long way from the forest.","","小拇指爬上树顶，想看看能否发现什么。他向四周张望，终于看到了一丝烛光般的微弱光亮，但那光亮在离森林很远的地方。"
"He came down, and, when upon the ground, he could see it no more, which grieved him sadly.","","他从树上下来，回到地面上，亮光却一点儿都看不见了，这让他非常难过。"
"However, having walked for some time with his brothers toward that side on which he had seen the light, he perceived it again as he came out of the wood.","","然而，他和哥哥们朝着看见光亮的方向走了一段时间后，就在走出森林的时候又看到了那亮光。"
"They came at last to the house where this candle was, not without an abundance of fear: for very often they lost sight of it, which happened every time they came into a bottom.","","他们惴惴不安地来到那间亮着烛光的屋子，因为每次他们想一探究竟的时候，却又常常看不到那烛光了。"
"They knocked at the door, and a good woman came and opened it; she asked them what they would have.","","他们敲了敲门，一位善良的女人走出来开门。她问他们来干什么。"
"Little Thumb told her they were poor children who had been lost in the forest, and desired to lodge there for God’s sake.","","小拇指告诉她说，他们是在森林里迷了路的可怜孩子，希望她能看在上帝的份上让他们在此借宿。"
"The woman, seeing them so very pretty, began to weep, and said to them:","","女人看孩子们那么可爱，便开始抽泣起来，然后对他们说："
"“Alas! poor babies; whither are ye come?","","“唉！可怜的孩子们，你们为什么会到这里来？"
"Do ye know that this house belongs to a cruel ogre who eats up little children?”","","你们知不知道这屋子的主人是一个吃小孩的残忍妖怪？”"
"“Ah! dear madam,” answered Little Thumb (who trembled every joint of him, as well as his brothers), “what shall we do?","","“哦！亲爱的夫人，”小拇指一边说着，一边和哥哥们一样浑身发抖，“那我们该怎么办？"
"To be sure the wolves of the forest will devour us to-night if you refuse us to lie here; and so we would rather the gentleman should eat us; and perhaps he may take pity upon us, especially if you please to beg it of him.”","","如果今晚你不让我们在这里借宿，森林里的狼肯定会吃了我们的。要是这样，我们宁愿被那位先生吃掉。而且，说不定他会可怜我们的，要是你能为我们求求情的话，就更有希望了。”"
"The Ogre’s wife, who believed she could conceal them from her husband till morning, let them come in, and brought them to warm themselves at a very good fire; for there was a whole sheep upon the spit, roasting for the Ogre’s supper.","","妖怪的妻子认为自己能把他们藏好，不会让妖怪在第二天早上以前察觉，便叫他们进了屋，还让他们到一个烧得很旺的炉火旁取暖。炉火上有一整只用烤肉叉子穿起的羊，那是烤给妖怪的晚餐。"
"As they began to be a little warm they heard three or four great raps at the door; this was the Ogre, who had come home.","","正当他们开始感到有些暖和的时候，他们听到三四声重重的敲门声。妖怪回来了。"
"Upon this she hid them under the bed and went to open the door.","","于是，她把孩子们藏到床底下，然后去开门。"
"The Ogre presently asked if supper was ready and the wine drawn, and then sat himself down to table.","","不一会儿，妖怪问晚餐是否做好了，酒是否准备好了，便坐到了桌子旁。"
"The sheep was as yet all raw and bloody; but he liked it the better for that.","","那头羊还全是生的，血淋淋的样子，但这似乎更符合他的口味。"
"He sniffed about to the right and left, saying:","","他东闻闻，西嗅嗅，说道："
"“I smell fresh meat.”","","“我闻到了鲜肉的味道。”"
"“What you smell so,” said his wife, “must be the calf which I have just now killed and flayed.”","","“怎么会呢？”他妻子说道，“肯定是那头我刚刚才宰完、剥了皮的小牛的味道。”"
"“I smell fresh meat, I tell thee once more,” replied the Ogre, looking crossly at his wife; “and there is something here which I do not understand.”","","“再和你说一遍，我闻到了鲜肉的味道，”妖怪愤怒地看着妻子说，“家里肯定瞒着我藏了什么东西。”"
"As he spoke these words he got up from the table and went directly to the bed.","","他一边说，一边从桌子旁站起来，然后径直朝床的方向走去。"
"“Ah, ah!” said he; “I see then how thou wouldst cheat me, thou cursed woman; I know not why I do not eat thee up too, but it is well for thee that thou art a tough old carrion.","","“哈，哈！”他说道，“我看你居然敢骗我，你这该死的女人。我不明白为什么我没把你一起吃了，真是便宜你了，你这老不死的。"
"Here is good game, which comes very quickly to entertain three ogres of my acquaintance who are to pay me a visit in a day or two.”","","这真不错，很快我就可以用他们来款待过几天要来拜访我的几个老朋友了。”"
"With that he dragged them out from under the bed one by one.","","于是，妖怪把孩子们从床下一个接一个地拽了出来。"
"The poor children fell upon their knees, and begged his pardon; but they had to do with one of the most cruel ogres in the world, who, far from having any pity on them, had already devoured them with his eyes, and told his wife they would be delicate eating when tossed up with good savory sauce.","","可怜的孩子们跪下求饶，但是，对方是世界上最残忍的妖怪之一。他没有一点儿可怜他们的意思，反而两眼露出杀气。他还告诉妻子说，如果能配上一些好的调料，那将是一顿美味佳肴。"
"He then took a great knife, and, coming up to these poor children, whetted it upon a great whet-stone which he held in his left hand.","","然后他右手拿着一把大刀，左手拿着磨刀石，磨刀霍霍地朝可怜的孩子们走去。"
"He had already taken hold of one of them when his wife said to him:","","他抓住了一个孩子，这时，他妻子对他说："
"“Why need you do it now?","","“为什么要现在杀他们呢？"
"Is it not time enough to-morrow?”","","明天再杀不是也来得及吗？”"
"“Hold your prating,” said the Ogre; “they will eat the tenderer.","","“闭嘴，”妖怪说道，“现在宰了他们，明天吃起来，肉就更嫩了。”"
"“But you have so much meat already,” replied his wife, “you have no occasion; here are a calf, two sheep, and half a hog.”","","“可你还有那么多没吃完的肉呢，”他妻子回答道，“你没有理由这样做。这儿还有一头小牛、两只绵羊和半头猪呢。”"
"“That is true,” said the Ogre; “give them their belly full that they may not fall away, and put them to bed.”","","“那倒也是，”妖怪说，“那就让他们吃饱肚子，免得饿瘦了，然后叫他们去睡觉。”"
"The good woman was overjoyed at this, and gave them a good supper; but they were so much afraid they could not eat a bit.","","好心的女人听他这么一说，高兴极了，就去给小男孩们准备了丰盛的晚餐。但他们实在太害怕，一口也吃不下。"
"As for the Ogre, he sat down again to drink, being highly pleased that he had got wherewithal to treat his friends.","","妖怪再次重新坐下来喝酒。能有这样的好东西招待朋友，他可高兴了。"
"He drank a dozen glasses more than ordinary, which got up into his head and obliged him to go to bed.","","他比平时多喝了十几杯，喝得头晕晕乎乎的，便只好上床睡觉了。"
"The Ogre had seven daughters, all little children, and these young ogresses had all of them very fine complexions, because they used to eat fresh meat like their father; but they had little gray eyes, quite round, hooked noses, and very long sharp teeth, standing at a good distance from each other.","","妖怪有七个女儿，都是小孩子。这些年轻的女妖气色都相当好，因为她们和爸爸一样，经常吃生肉。但她们却有着很圆的灰色小眼睛、钩鼻子和长长的尖牙齿，牙齿缝隙还很大。"
"They were not as yet over and above mischievous, but they promised very fair for it, for they had already bitten little children, that they might suck their blood.","","她们目前还不算凶狠，但可能朝这个方向发展，因为她们已经咬过一些小孩，可能还吸过他们的血了。"
"They had been put to bed early, with every one a crown of gold upon her head.","","她们早早被安顿到床上睡觉了，每人头上戴着一顶金冠。"
"There was in the same chamber a bed of the like bigness, and it was into this bed the Ogre’s wife put the seven little boys, after which she went to bed to her husband.","","她们的房间有两张大小相仿的床，妖怪妻子把七个小男孩安顿在了另一张床上。然后，她就和丈夫上床睡觉了。"
"Little Thumb, who had observed that the Ogre’s daughters had crowns of gold upon their heads, and was afraid lest the Ogre should repent his not killing them, got up about midnight, and, taking his brothers’ bonnets and his own, went very softly and put them upon the heads of the seven little ogresses, after having taken off their crowns of gold, which he put upon his own head and his brothers’, that the Ogre might take them for his daughters, and his daughters for the little boys whom he wanted to kill.","","小拇指注意到妖怪的女儿们头上戴着金冠，他还担心妖怪会后悔没有杀死他们，于是他半夜起来，摘下自己和哥哥们的软布帽，轻轻走到小妖怪们的床前，摘下了她们的金冠，把自己和哥哥们的软布帽戴到她们头上，再把七顶金冠戴到自己和哥哥们的头上。这样，妖精就会把他们当成自己的女儿，而把他自己的女儿当成他想杀的七个小男孩了。"
"All this succeeded according to his desire; for, the Ogre waking about midnight, and sorry that he deferred to do that till morning which he might have done over-night, threw himself hastily out of bed, and, taking his great knife,","","果然一切不出所料。妖怪半夜醒来，懊悔原本可以连夜完成的事却要拖到第二天早上，于是急忙从床上起来，抡起了他的大刀。"
"“Let us see,” said he, “how our little rogues do, and not make two jobs of the matter.”","","“让我们去看看，”他说道，“我那几个小畜生怎么样了。别再犹豫不决了。”"
"He then went up, groping all the way, into his daughters’ chamber, and, coming to the bed where the little boys lay, and who were every soul of them fast asleep, except Little Thumb, who was terribly afraid when he found the Ogre fumbling about his head, as he had done about his brothers’, the Ogre, feeling the golden crowns, said:","","于是，他上了楼，摸索着来到他女儿们的房间，走到了小男孩们睡的床跟前。他们都睡熟了，只有小拇指还醒着。妖怪像摸哥哥们的头那样摸了摸小拇指的头，这让他害怕极了。妖怪一摸到金冠就说："
"“I should have made a fine piece of work of it, truly; I find I drank too much last night.”","","“我确实差点儿闯下大祸了。看来昨晚我真是喝多了。”"
"Then he went to the bed where the girls lay; and, having found the boys’ little bonnets,","","然后他走到女孩们睡的床前，摸到了男孩们的小软布帽。"
"“Ah!” said he, “my merry lads, are you there?","","“哈哈！”他说道，“我快乐的小伙子们，原来你们在这里呀？"
"Let us work as we ought.”","","那让我们做该做的事情吧。”"
"And saying these words, without more ado, he cut the throats of all his seven daughters.","","说完，妖怪就干脆地把他七个女儿的喉咙给割断了。"
"Well pleased with what he had done, he went to bed again to his wife.","","干完这件事，他很满意，便又回到床上睡觉去了。"
"So soon as Little Thumb heard the Ogre snore, he waked his brothers, and bade them all put on their clothes presently and follow him.","","一听到妖怪的呼噜声，小拇指便叫醒哥哥们，叫他们赶快穿好衣服跟他走。"
"They stole down softly into the garden, and got over the wall.","","他们蹑手蹑脚走到花园，翻墙而去。"
"They kept running about all night, and trembled all the while, without knowing which way they went.","","整个晚上他们一直跑啊跑，始终在发抖，他们都不知道跑到了什么地方。"
"The Ogre, when he awoke, said to his wife: “Go upstairs and dress those young rascals who came here last night.”","","妖怪醒来后，对妻子说：“上楼去，处理一下昨晚来这儿的那帮小畜生。”"
"The wife was very much surprised at this goodness of her husband, not dreaming after what manner she should dress them; but, thinking that he had ordered her to go and put on their clothes, she went up, and was strangely astonished when she perceived her seven daughters killed, and weltering in their blood.","","妻子对丈夫这次的好心感到特别惊讶，她没有想到这是让她去处理那些孩子，而是以为丈夫吩咐她去给他们穿衣服。于是她上了楼，只见七个女儿倒在了血泊中，已经死了。她感到莫名地惊恐。"
"She fainted away, for this is the first expedient almost all women find in such cases.","","她晕了过去，几乎所有女人遇到这种情况都会先晕过去的。"
"The Ogre, fearing his wife would be too long in doing what he had ordered, went up himself to help her.","","妖怪担心妻子一个人干得太慢，便亲自上楼去帮她。"
"He was no less amazed than his wife at this frightful spectacle.","","他看到这种恐怖的场面，惊讶的程度丝毫不低于他的妻子。"
"“Ah! what have I done?” cried he.","","“啊！我都干了些什么？”他大叫道，"
"“The wretches shall pay for it, and that instantly.”","","“那帮小混蛋会为此付出代价的，马上就会。”"
"He threw a pitcher of water upon his wife’s face, and, having brought her to herself, said:","","他把一壶水往妻子脸上一浇，等她醒过来后，他说："
"“Give me quickly my boots of seven leagues, that I may go and catch them.”","","“把我的七里靴拿来，我好去把他们抓回来。”"
"He went out, and, having run over a vast deal of ground, both on this side and that, he came at last into the very road where the poor children were, and not above a hundred paces from their father’s house.","","于是他出发了，四面八方跑了一阵后，最终追到了可怜的孩子们走的那条路上。那里离孩子们的家不超过一百步路了。"
"They espied the Ogre, who went at one step from mountain to mountain, and over rivers as easily as the narrowest kennels.","","他们发现了妖怪。那个妖怪一步就能翻过一座大山，越过大河也像跨最窄的阴沟那么容易。"
"Little Thumb, seeing a hollow rock near the place where they were, made his brothers hide themselves in it, and crowded into it himself, minding always what would become of the Ogre.","","小拇指发现离他们不远的地方有一个岩洞，便叫哥哥们都躲在里面，他自己也挤了进去，并始终观察着妖怪的动静。"
"The Ogre, who found himself much tired with his long and fruitless journey (for these boots of seven leagues greatly fatigued the wearer), had a great mind to rest himself, and, by chance, went to sit down upon the rock where the little boys had hid themselves.","","妖怪走了那么长的冤枉路，感到很累（因为穿着七里靴走路是很累的），特别想休息一会儿。凑巧的是，他坐在了小男孩们藏身的那块岩石上。"
"As it was impossible he could be more weary than he was, he fell asleep, and, after reposing himself some time, began to snore so frightfully that the poor children were no less afraid of him than when he held up his great knife and was going to cut their throats.","","他累到了极点，很快就睡着了，不一会儿，还打起了呼噜。他如雷的鼾声吓到了可怜的孩子们，就像当初他举起大刀要割断他们的喉咙时一样害怕。"
"Little Thumb was not so much frightened as his brothers, and told them that they should run away immediately toward home while the Ogre was asleep so soundly, and that they should not be in any pain about him.","","小拇指没像哥哥们那样害怕，他告诉哥哥们趁妖怪正熟睡赶紧跑回家，还告诉他们不必为他担心。"
"They took his advice, and got home presently.","","他们听了他的话，很快回到了家里。"
"Little Thumb came up to the Ogre, pulled off his boots gently and put them on his own legs.","","小拇指走近妖怪，轻轻脱下他的靴子，然后穿在了自己脚上。"
"The boots were very long and large, but, as they were fairies, they had the gift of becoming big and little, according to the legs of those who wore them; so that they fitted his feet and legs as well as if they had been made on purpose for him.","","这靴子原本是很长很大的，但因为它是魔靴，能随着穿靴者的腿脚变大或变小，所以小拇指穿上它大小刚好，就像是为他量身定做的一样。"
"He went immediately to the Ogre’s house, where he saw his wife crying bitterly for the loss of the Ogre’s murdered daughters.","","他立马就去了妖怪家里，看到妖怪妻子正在为妖怪亲手杀死的女儿哭得很伤心。"
"“Your husband,” said Little Thumb, “is in very great danger, being taken by a gang of thieves, who have sworn to kill him if he does not give them all his gold and silver.","","“你丈夫，”小拇指说道，“遇到大危险了。他被一帮强盗带走了，他们扬言说，他如果不交出他所有的金银，他们就要杀死他。"
"The very moment they held their daggers at his throat he perceived me, and desired me to come and tell you the condition he is in, and that you should give me whatsoever he has of value, without retaining any one thing; for otherwise they will kill him without mercy; and, as his case is very pressing, he desired me to make use (you see I have them on) of his boots, that I might make the more haste and to show you that I do not impose upon you.”","","就在强盗们举起匕首要杀他的时候，他看见了我，求我来告诉你他的处境，还让你把他所有值钱的东西都交给我，一件也不能留，要不然，他们就会毫不留情地杀死他。另外，由于情况紧急，他让我穿上他的靴子（你看，靴子正在我脚上），这样我就可以快点儿赶来，而且这也说明我没有骗你。”"
"The good woman, being sadly frightened, gave him all she had: for this Ogre was a very good husband, though he used to eat up little children.","","这位善良的女人被吓得胆战心惊，把她所有的东西都交给了小拇指。那妖怪虽说吃了不少小孩，但也是位好丈夫。"
"Little Thumb, having thus got all the Ogre’s money, came home to his father’s house, where he was received with abundance of joy.","","小拇指拿到了妖怪所有的钱财，回到家里，家人欢欣鼓舞地迎接了他。"
"There are many people who do not agree in this circumstance, and pretend that Little Thumb never robbed the Ogre at all, and that he only thought he might very justly, and with a safe conscience, take off his boots of seven leagues, because he made no other use of them but to run after little children.","","很多人对小拇指的经历不以为然，他们不承认小拇指抢夺过妖怪的财宝，还说他只是出于安全的考虑且自认为非常正义才脱下了妖怪的七里靴，因为这双靴子妖怪除了用来追小孩，别无他用。"
"These folks affirm that they are very well assured of this, and the more as having drunk and eaten often at the fagot-maker’s house.","","这些人肯定地说他们都非常相信这一点，而且随着他们经常在樵夫家里喝酒吃饭，对此就更加确信了。"
"They aver that when Little Thumb had taken off the Ogre’s boots he went to Court, where he was informed that they were very much in pain about a certain army, which was two hundred leagues off, and the success of a battle.","","他们声称小拇指脱掉妖怪的靴子后去了王宫觐见，在那里，他了解到王宫里现在很担心两百里之外的军队的安危以及战事的胜败。"
"He went, say they, to the King, and told him that, if he desired it, he would bring him news from the army before night.","","他们说，他去了以后就跟国王说，如果国王需要，他愿意天黑前向国王禀告军队的战况。"
"The King promised him a great sum of money upon that condition.","","国王承诺说，如果小拇指真能做到这一点，将奖励他一大笔钱财。"
"Little Thumb was as good as his word, and returned that very same night with the news; and, this first expedition causing him to be known, he got whatever he pleased, for the King paid him very well for carrying his orders to the army.","","小拇指实现了自己的诺言，当晚就带回了消息。他第一次报信就让他出了名，他得到了他想要的任何东西，因为他把国王的指令传达给了军队，国王对他大加奖赏。"
"After having for some time carried on the business of a messenger, and gained thereby great wealth, he went home to his father, where it was impossible to express the joy they were all in at his return.","","他就这样做了几次信使，也因此获得了大笔财富。之后他回到了自己的家，全家人对他的归来都高兴得无以言表。"
"He made the whole family very easy, bought places for his father and brothers, and, by that means, settled them very handsomely in the world, and, in the meantime, made his court to perfection. [1]","","他让整个家庭过得很舒适，还为爸爸和哥哥们买了房子，他们也因此过上了很体面的生活，同时，他也使他的庭院变得完美。[1]"
