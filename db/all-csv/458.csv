"The Knights of the Fish","鱼骑士"
"by Andrew Lang","作者：安德鲁·朗格"
"Once upon a time there lived an old cobbler who worked hard at his trade from morning till night, and scarcely gave himself a moment to eat.","从前，有一位老鞋匠，他兢兢业业地工作，从早忙到晚，甚至不给自己多少吃饭的时间。"
"But, industrious as he was, he could hardly buy bread and cheese for himself and his wife, and they grew thinner and thinner daily.","尽管鞋匠很勤奋，却还是几乎养不活自己和老伴，他们一天比一天消瘦。"
"For a long while whey pretended to each other that they had no appetite, and that a few blackberries from the hedges were a great deal nicer than a good strong bowl of soup.","很长一段时间，他们都骗对方说自己没有食欲，还说从篱笆上摘来的那点儿黑莓比一大碗汤都要美味得多。"
"But at length there came a day when the cobbler could bear it no longer, and he threw away his last, and borrowing a rod from a neighbour he went out to fish.","但是终于有一天，鞋匠再也挨不住了，于是丢掉鞋楦，从邻居那里借了一根竿子，出去钓鱼去了。"
"Now the cobbler was as patient about fishing as he had been about cobbling.","鞋匠钓起鱼来很有耐心，就跟以前给人补鞋的时候一样。"
"From dawn to dark he stood on the banks of the little stream, without hooking anything better than an eel, or a few old shoes, that even he, clever though he was, felt were not worth mending.","从黎明到黄昏，他一直站在小溪边上，却什么好东西也没钓着，只钓到了一条鳗鱼，还有一些旧鞋子，而那些旧鞋子就是像他这般技巧娴熟的人也觉得没有修补的价值了。"
"At length his patience began to give way, and as he undressed one night he said to himself: ‘Well, I will give it one more chance; and if I don’t catch a fish to-morrow, I will go and hang myself.’","最后，鞋匠的耐心渐渐消磨光了。一天晚上，他脱衣服的时候对自己说道：“好吧，我再给自己一个机会，如果明天还是一条鱼都钓不到，那我就自我了断算了。”"
"He had not cast his line for ten minutes the next morning before he drew from the river the most beautiful fish he had ever seen in his life.","第二天早上，鞋匠抛出鱼线还不到十分钟，就从河里拉出一条鱼，那是他一生见过的最美丽的鱼。"
"But he nearly fell into the water from surprise, when the fish began to speak to him, in a small, squeaky voice: ","但是鞋匠惊得差点儿掉进河里，因为那条鱼开始吱吱地跟他说话，话音很低："
"‘Take me back to your hut and cook me; then cut me up, and sprinkle me over with pepper and salt.","“把我带回你的小屋煮了，然后切成块，撒上胡椒和盐。"
"Give two of the pieces to your wife, and bury two more in the garden.’","给你的妻子两块，再埋两块在菜园里。”"
"The cobbler did not know what to make of these strange words; but he was wiser than many people, and when he did not understand, he thought it was well to obey.","鞋匠不知道该怎样去理解这些奇怪的话，但是他比很多人都要聪明，觉得有什么不明白的时候就最好是照着去做。"
"His children wanted to eat all the fish themselves, and begged their father to tell them what to do with the pieces he had put aside; but the cobbler only laughed, and told them it was no business of theirs.","鞋匠的孩子们想要把鱼全部吃掉，于是恳求父亲告诉他们打算怎么处理放在一边的鱼块。但是鞋匠只是笑了笑，告诉他们这不关他们的事。"
"And when they were safe in bed he stole out and buried the two pieces in the garden.","等他们都上床睡着了，鞋匠偷偷溜出来，埋了两块鱼在菜园里。"
"By and by two babies, exactly alike, lay in a cradle, and in the garden were two tall plants, with two brilliant shields on the top.","不久以后，摇篮里躺着两个小婴儿，长得完全一个样；而菜园里长出两株高大的植物，顶上的两个盖熠熠夺目。"
"Years passed away, and the babies were almost men.","好几年过去了，当初的婴儿也差不多长大成人了。"
"They were tired of living quietly at home, being mistaken for each other by everybody they saw, and determined to set off in different directions, to seek adventures.","他们厌倦了在家里平静地生活，厌倦了被所有见过的人错认为对方，于是决定朝不同方向出发去探险。"
"So, one fine morning, the two brothers left the hut, and walked together to the place where the great road divided.","兄弟俩在一个美好的早晨离开了小屋，一起来到大路的分岔口。"
"There they embraced and parted, promising that if anything remarkable had happened to either, he would return to the cross roads and wait till his brother came.","他们在那里相拥告别，许诺如果哪一方发生什么不寻常的事，就回到分岔口等另一方到来。"
"The youth who took the path that ran eastwards arrived presently at a large city, where he found everybody standing at the doors, wringing their hands and weeping bitterly.","取道向东的年轻人不久来到一座大城市。在那里，他看到所有人都站在门口，紧握双手、痛哭流涕。"
"‘What is the matter?’ asked he, pausing and looking round.","“怎么了？”他停下来四下望了望问道。"
"And a man replied, in a faltering voice, that each year a beautiful girl was chosen by lot to be offered up to a dreadful fiery dragon, who had a mother even worse than himself, and this year the lot had fallen on their peerless princess.","一个男人支支吾吾回答说，每年都有一个美丽的女孩被抽中，用来献给一条凶残的恶龙，恶龙的母亲甚至比恶龙本身还要坏，而今天抽中的是他们无与伦比的公主。"
"‘But where IS the princess?’ said the young man once more, and again the man answered him: ‘She is standing under a tree, a mile away, waiting for the dragon.’","“可是公主在哪儿呢？”年轻人再次说道。接着，又是那个男人回答说：“她正站在一英里外的一棵树下等着那条龙。”"
"This time the Knight of the Fish did not stop to hear more, but ran off as fast as he could, and found the princess bathed in tears, and trembling from head to foot.","这一次，鱼骑士没有驻足多听，飞奔过去，发现公主已经哭成了一个泪人，浑身都在颤抖着。"
"She turned as she heard the sound of his sword, and removed her handkerchief from her eyes.","公主听到骑士拔剑的声音，转过身来，将手帕从眼旁挪开。"
"‘Fly,’ she cried; ‘fly while you have yet time, before that monster sees you.’","“快跑，”公主大声说道，“趁那个怪物还没看到你，你还有时间跑。”"
"She said it, and she mean it; yet, when he had turned his back, she felt more forsaken than before.","公主是这么说的，也是这么想的，可是骑士一转身，公主就觉得更加孤独凄凉了。"
"But in reality it was not more than a few minutes before he came back, galloping furiously on a horse he had borrowed, and carrying a huge mirror across its neck.","可事实上，没过几分钟，骑士就骑着借来的马狂奔而来，马脖子上还挂着一面大镜子。"
"‘I am in time, then,’ he cried, dismounting very carefully, and placing the mirror against the trunk of a tree.","“还好赶上了。”骑士喊道，从马脖子上小心翼翼地取下镜子，靠着一根树干放着。"
"‘Give me your veil,’ he said hastily to the princess.","“把你的面纱给我。”骑士急促地对公主说道。"
"And when she had unwound it from her head he covered the mirror with it.","公主从头上取下面纱，骑士把它罩在了镜子上。"
"‘The moment the dragon comes near you, you must tear off the veil,’ cried he; ‘and be sure you hide behind the mirror.","“恶龙靠近你的时候，你一定要扯下面纱，”骑士大声说，“并且确保自己躲在镜子后面。"
"Have no fear; I shall be at hand.’","别怕，我就在旁边。”"
"He and his horse had scarcely found shelter amongst some rocks, when the flap of the dragon’s wings could be plainly heard.","骑士刚带着马躲到几块岩石之间，就清楚地听到恶龙鼓动双翼的声音。"
"He tossed his head with delight at the sight of her, and approached slowly to the place where she stood, a little in front of the mirror.","看到公主，恶龙高兴地点了点头，慢慢靠近，而公主就站在镜子前一点点远的地方。"
"Then, still looking the monster steadily in the face, she passed one hand behind her back and snatched off the veil, stepping swiftly behind the tree as she did so.","公主盯着怪物的脸，目光坚定不移，一只手伸到背后，将面纱扯下来，同时敏捷地走到了树后面。"
"The princess had not known, when she obeyed the orders of the Knight of the Fish, what she expected to happen.","公主照着鱼骑士的话做的时候，并不知道她到底在期待着什么事情发生。"
"Would the dragon with snaky locks be turned to stone, she wondered, like the dragon in an old story her nurse had told her; or would some fiery spark dart from the heart of the mirror, and strike him dead?","她想，这条戴着蛇形锁的恶龙是不是会像奶娘给她讲过的古老故事里的那条龙那样，被变成石头？或者，会不会从镜心里飞出一些燃烧着的火镖，把恶龙击毙？"
"Neither of these things occurred, but, instead, the dragon stopped short with surprise and rage when he saw a monster before him as big and strong as himself.","但是这种事一件也没发生。相反，恶龙看到自己面前有一个怪物，和它自己一样又大又强，顿时愣了一会儿，又惊又气。"
"He shook his mane with rage and fury; the enemy in front did exactly the same.","暴怒之下，它抖了抖鬃毛，面前的敌人也做着相同的动作。"
"He lashed his tail, and rolled his red eyes, and the dragon opposite was no whit behind him.","它摆了摆尾，转了转红色的眼睛，而它的对手也做得丝毫不差。"
"Opening his mouth to its very widest, he gave an awful roar; but the other dragon only roared back.","它又张大巨嘴，发出一声可怕的咆哮，而另一条龙也回以咆哮。"
"This was too much, and with another roar which made the princess shake in her shoes, he flung himself upon his foe.","就这样对峙了好久，它又咆哮一声，向敌人猛冲过去，咆哮声震得公主双脚颤抖。"
"In an instant the mirror lay at his feet broken into a thousand pieces, but as every piece reflected part of himself, the dragon thought that he too had been smashed into atoms.","瞬间，镜子在恶龙脚下碎成千片，而每一片都照出它身上的一部分，恶龙觉得自己也成了一堆碎片。"
"It was the moment for which the Knight of the Fish had watched and waited, and before the dragon could find out that he was not hurt at all, the young man’s lance was down his throat, and he was rolling, dead, on the grass.","鱼骑士观察着，他等的就是这一刻。恶龙还没弄明白自己其实并没受伤，骑士的长矛就刺进了它的喉咙。恶龙在草地上打了几个滚就死掉了。"
"Oh! what shouts of joy rang through the great city, when the youth came riding back with the princess sitting behind him, and dragging the horrible monster by a cord.","哦！那是怎样的一片欢呼声啊，响彻了整座城市！只见这个年轻人骑着马，用绳子拖着那个可怕的怪物归来，而公主就坐在年轻人的身后。"
"Everybody cried out that the king must give the victor the hand of the princess; and so he did, and no one had ever seen such balls and feasts and sports before.","所有人都大声喊着，让国王必须把公主嫁给这个胜利者。国王的确这样做了，所有的舞会和宴乐都是前所未见的。"
"And when they were all over the young couple went to the palace prepared for them, which was so large that it was three miles round.","一切结束之后，年轻的夫妻回到为他们准备的宫殿里。宫殿很大，方圆三英里。"
"The first wet day after their marriage the bridegroom begged the bride to show him all the rooms in the palace, and it was so big and took so long that the sun was shining brightly again before they stepped on to the roof to see the view.","婚后第一天，新郎请新娘带他参观宫殿里的所有房间。宫殿如此之大，他们花了很长时间，等爬到屋顶观景之时，已经是第二天了。"
"‘What castle is that out there,’ asked the knight; ‘it seems to be made of black marble?’","“那是座什么城堡？”骑士问道，“看上去好像是用黑色大理石建成的。”"
"‘It is called the castle of Albatroz,’ answered the princess.","“它叫信天翁城堡。”公主回答说，"
"‘It is enchanted, and no one that has tried to enter it has ever come back.’","“那里被施了魔法，所有试图进入城堡的人没有一个回来过。”"
"Her husband said nothing, and began to talk of something else; but the next morning he ordered his horse, took his spear, called his bloodhound, and set off for the castle.","她丈夫没说什么，开始转开话题。但是第二天一早，他就要了一匹马，带上矛，叫上猎犬，出发去了那座城堡。"
"It needed a brave man to approach it, for it made your hair stand on end merely to look at it; it was as dark as the night of a storm, and as silent as the grave.","要靠近这座城堡需要很大的勇气，因为光是看着它都令人觉得毛骨悚然。它就像暴风雨的夜晚那般黑，安静得如同一座坟墓。"
"But the Knight of the Fish knew no fear, and had never turned his back on an enemy; so he drew out his horn, and blew a blast.","但是鱼骑士毫不畏惧，勇于正面迎敌，他拿出号角吹了一声。"
"The sound awoke all the sleeping echoes in the castle, and was repeated now loudly, now softly; now near, and now far.","响声弄醒了城堡里所有沉睡着的回声，它们被重复着，声音时大时小，时近时远。"
"But nobody stirred for all that.","但是没有一个人因此前来。"
"‘Is there anyone inside?’ cried the young man in his loudest voice; ‘anyone who will give a knight hospitality?","“里面有人吗？”年轻人扯开嗓子大声喊道，“有没有人来招待一位骑士？"
"Neither governor, nor squire, not even a page?’","没有堡主，没有护卫，甚至连一个侍者也没有？”"
"‘Not even a page!’ answered the echoes.","“一个侍者也没有！”那些回声答道。"
"But the young man did not heed them, and only struck a furious blow at the gate.","但是年轻人没有注意到它们，只是朝门上猛击了一拳。"
"Then a small grating opened, and there appeared the tip of a huge nose, which belonged to the ugliest old woman that ever was seen.","然后一个小格子打开了，从那里冒出一只大鼻子的鼻尖，鼻子的主人是个老妇人，奇丑无比，没人见过这么丑的人。"
"‘What do you want?’ said she.","“你想要什么？”老妇人说道。"
"‘To enter,’ he answered shortly.","“我要进去，”骑士立刻回答说，"
"‘Can I rest here this night?","“今晚我可以在这儿休息吗？"
"Yes or No?’","行还是不行？”"
"‘No, No, No!’ repeated the echoes.","“不行，不行，不行！”回声重复着。"
"Between the fierce sun and his anger at being kept waiting, the Knight of the Fish had grown so hot that he lifted his visor, and when the old woman saw how handsome he was, she began fumbling with the lock of the gate.","骄阳似火，加上恼于一直这么等着，鱼骑士觉得很热，于是揭去了面甲。老妇人看他如此英俊，便笨拙地开起门上的锁来。"
"‘Come in, come in,’ said she, ‘so fine a gentleman will do us no harm.’","“请进，请进，”老妇人说道，“这么好的绅士应该不会给我们带来伤害。”"
"‘Harm!’ repeated the echoes, but again the young man paid no heed.","“伤害！”回声重复道，这一次年轻人又没注意。"
"‘Let us go in, ancient dame,’ but she interrupted him.","“我们一起进去吧，老夫人。”但是老妇人打断了他的话。"
"‘You must call me the Lady Berberisca,’ she answered, sharply; ‘and this is my castle, to which I bid you welcome.","“你必须称呼我为柏柏尔利斯卡夫人，”老妇人严厉地回答道，“这是我的城堡，欢迎你进来。"
"You shall live here with me and be my husband.’","你要和我住在一起，做我的丈夫。”"
"But at these words the knight let his spear fall, so surprised was he.","听到这些话，骑士惊讶得将矛掉落在地。"
"‘I marry YOU? why you must be a hundred at least!’ cried he.","“跟你成亲？你最少也该有一百岁了！”他大声说道，"
"‘You are mad!","“你疯了！"
"All I desire is to inspect the castle and then go.’","我只不过想看看这座城堡，然后就离开。”"
"As he spoke he heard the voices give a mocking laugh; but the old woman took no notice, and only bade the knight follow her.","骑士说着，听到有声音发出一阵嘲笑，但是老妇人置之不理，只是命令骑士跟着自己。"
"Old though she was, it seemed impossible to tire her.","老妇人虽已是老态龙钟，却似乎不知疲倦。"
"There was no room, however small, she did not lead him into, and each room was full of curious things he had never seen before.","她带骑士进入每一个房间，哪怕很小的房间也不落下。每间房里都满是些他从未见过的稀奇古怪的东西。"
"At length they came to a stone staircase, which was so dark that you could not see your hand if you held it up before your face.","最后，他们来到一架石楼梯处，那里伸手不见五指。"
"‘I have kept my most precious treasure till the last,’ said the old woman; ‘but let me go first, for the stairs are steep, and you might easily break your leg.’","“我把最珍贵的财富都放在这底下了，”老妇人说道，“不过让我走在前边吧，楼梯太陡，一不小心就会摔断你的腿的。”"
" So on she went, now and then calling back to the young man in the darkness.","于是，在这黑暗之中，老妇人走在了前面，并时不时地回过头来叫年轻人跟上。"
"But he did not know that she had slipped aside into a recess, till suddenly he put his foot on a trap door which gave way under him, and he fell down, down, as many good knights had done before him, and his voice joined the echoes of theirs.","年轻人并不知道老妇人已经闪到了一个凹陷处，直到突然一下踩进了一个陷阱，那是一个通道，下面是空的，年轻人像先前很多骑士一样一直往下掉啊掉啊，他的声音也加入到那些骑士的回声之中。"
"‘So you would not marry me!’ chuckled the old witch.","“这样你就不用跟我成亲了！”老巫婆咯咯笑起来,"
"‘Ha! ha!","“哈！哈！"
"Ha! ha!’","哈！哈！”"
"Meanwhile his brother had wandered far and wide, and at last he wandered back to the same great city where the other young knight had met with so many adventures.","与此同时，另一个鱼骑士已经走遍了各地。最后，他也来到这座他的兄弟曾经历过诸多奇遇的城市。"
"He noticed, with amazement, that as he walked through the streets the guards drew themselves up in line, and saluted him, and the drummers played the royal march; but he was still more bewildered when several servants in livery ran up to him and told him that the princess was sure something terrible had befallen him, and had made herself ill with weeping.","他惊愕地注意到，当他从街道上走过的时候，卫兵们就会列成队朝他致敬，鼓手们也演奏起皇家进行曲。但是让他更加疑惑的是，几个身着制服的仆人跑上前来，告诉他说公主以为他出了事都哭出病来了。"
"At last it occurred to him that once more he had been taken for his brother.","最后他突然明白，自己又一次被错认为了自己的兄弟。"
"‘I had better say nothing,’ thought he; ‘perhaps I shall be able to help him after all.’","“我最好什么也不说，”他想，“说不定我还能帮上他。”"
"So he suffered himself to be borne in triumph to the palace, where the princess threw herself into his arms.","于是他假装凯旋，回到宫殿，公主一下子扑进他怀里。"
"‘And so you did go to the castle?’ she asked.","“所以你是去了那座城堡？”公主问道。"
"‘Yes, of course I did,’ answered he.","“是的，我当然去了。”他回答道。"
"‘And what did you see there?’","“那你在那儿看到了什么？”"
"‘I am forbidden to tell you anything about it, until I have returned there once more,’ replied he.","“再一次返回城堡之前，我不能告诉你任何事。”他回答道。"
"‘Must you really go back to that dreadful place?’ she asked wistfully.","“你真的一定要再回到那个可怕的地方去吗？”公主忧郁地问道，"
"‘You are the only man who has ever come back from it.’","“你是唯一一个从那里回来的人。”"
"‘I must,’ was all he answered.","“我必须去。”他这样答道。"
"And the princess, who was a wise woman, only said: ‘Well, go to bed now, for I am sure you must be very tired.’","公主是个通情达理的女人，她只是说道：“好吧，现在去睡吧，我知道你一定很累了。”"
"But the knight shook his head.","但是骑士摇了摇头。"
"‘I have sworn never to lie in a bed as long as my work in the castle remains standing.’","“我发过誓，只要那座城堡的事还没解决，我就不睡觉。”"
"And the princess again sighed, and was silent.","公主又叹了一口气，没有说话。"
"Early next day the young man started for the castle, feeling sure that some terrible thing must have happened to his brother.","第二天一大早，这个年轻人就出发去城堡了，他觉得一定有什么可怕的事发生在了他兄弟身上。"
"At the blast of his horn the long nose of the old woman appeared at the grating, but the moment she caught sight of his face, she nearly fainted from fright, as she thought it was the ghost of the youth whose bones were lying in the dungeon of the castle.","号角响起，老妇人的长鼻子又出现小格子那里。老妇人看到他的脸，以为是尸骨还躺在城堡地牢里的那个年轻人的鬼魂回来了，吓得差点儿昏倒过去。"
"‘Lady of all the ages,’ cried the new comer, ‘did you not give hospitality to a young knight but a short time ago?’","“老太婆，”这个新来者大声喊道，“你是不是接待过一位骑士，就在不久前？”"
"‘A short time ago!’ wailed the voices.","“不久前！”那些声音哀号道。"
"‘And how have you ill-treated him?’ he went on.","“你是怎样虐待了他？”他继续问道。"
"‘Ill-treated him!’ answered the voices.","“虐待了他！”那些声音回答道。"
"The woman did not stop to hear more; she turned to fly; but the knight’s sword entered her body.","老妇人无暇多听，转身逃跑，但是骑士的剑插进了她的身体。"
"‘Where is my brother, cruel hag?’ asked he sternly.","“我的兄弟在哪儿，残忍的老妖婆？”他厉声问道。"
"‘I will tell you,’ said she; ‘but as I feel that I am going to die I shall keep that piece of news to myself, till you have brought me to life again.’","“我会告诉你的，”老妇人说道，“但是我觉得我就要死了，所以在你把我救活之前，我要守住那个秘密。”"
"The young man laughed scornfully.","年轻人轻蔑地笑了笑。"
"‘How do you propose that I should work that miracle?’","“你觉得我有能力创造那种奇迹吗？”"
"‘Oh, it is quite easy.","“哦，这很简单。"
"Go into the garden and gather the flowers of the everlasting plant and some of dragon’s blood.","去花园里摘些永生之木的花，取一些龙血。"
"Crush them together and boil them in a large tub of water, and then put me into it.’","把他们一起捣碎，放进一大桶水里煮沸，然后把我放进水里。”"
"The knight did as the old witch bade him, and, sure enough, she came out quite whole, but uglier than ever.","骑士照着老巫婆吩咐的做了，当然，老巫婆从水里出来之后完全好了，只不过比以前更丑了。"
"She then told the young man what had become of his brother, and he went down into the dungeon, and brought up his body and the bodies of the other victims who lay there, and when they were all washed in the magic water their strength was restored to them.","随后老巫婆告诉了年轻人他兄弟的事。年轻人来到地牢，将兄弟及其他骑士的尸骨带上来，在魔法药水里洗过之后，恢复了他们的体力。"
"And, besides these, he found in another cavern the bodies of the girls who had been sacrificed to the dragon, and brought them back to life also.","此外，他又在另一处洞穴里发现了献给恶龙的那些女孩的尸体，于是把她们也救活了。"
"As to the old witch, in the end she died of rage at seeing her prey escape her; and at the moment she drew her last breath the castle of Albatroz fell into ruins with a great noise.","至于那个老巫婆，她看到自己的猎物纷纷逃走，最后活活气死了。就在她咽下最后一口气那一刹那，信天翁城堡也伴着一声巨响坍塌下来，化为了一片废墟。"
