"An African Story","一个非洲故事"
"by Ernest Hemingway","作者：欧内斯特·海明威"
"He was waiting for the moon to rise and he felt Kibo’s hair rise under his hand as he stroked him to be quiet and they both watched and listened as the moon came up and gave them shadows.","他在静候着月亮升起，抚摩着基博，让它别出声，手下感受到狗的毛发都竖了起来。他和狗都注视着，倾听着，直到月亮升起，投射出他们的影子。"
"His arm was around the dog’s neck now and he could feel him shivering.","他搂着狗的脖子，能感觉到它浑身在颤抖。"
"All of the night sounds had stopped.","所有夜籁都已静止。"
"They did not hear the elephant and David did not see him until the dog turned his head and seemed to settle into David.","他们没有听到大象的声音。直到狗转过头，差点儿撞到他，戴维才发现了大象。"
"Then the elephant’s shadow covered them and he moved past making no noise at all and they smelled him in the light wind that came down from the mountain.","随即，大象的影子笼罩住他们，悄无声息地从他们面前走过。他们从山上吹来的微风中闻到了大象的气味。"
"He smelled strong but old and sour and when he was past David saw that the left tusk was so long it seemed to reach the ground.","那气味很浓烈，陈腐酸臭。当它走过去之后，戴维发现它左边的象牙长得似乎快碰到地面了。"
"They waited but no other elephants came by and then David and the dog started off running in the moonlight.","他们等了一会儿，但是再没有别的大象经过，于是戴维和狗开始在月光下奔跑起来。"
"The dog kept close behind him and when David stopped the dog pressed his muzzle into the back of his knee.","狗紧紧地跟在戴维的脚后，以至于他一停，狗鼻子就撞上了他的膝盖弯。"
"David had to see the bull again and they came up on him at the edge of the forest.","戴维非得再看一眼那头公象，终于他们在森林边上赶上了它。"
"He was traveling toward the mountain and slowly moving into the steady night breeze.","大象正朝着山的方向行进，迎着徐徐晚风缓缓而行。"
"David came close enough to see him cut off the moon again and to smell the sour oldness but he could not see the right tusk.","戴维走得很近，以至于又被大象的身影笼罩。他又闻到了那陈年的酸臭味，但就是看不到右边的象牙。"
"He was afraid to work closer with the dog and he took him back with the wind and pushed him down against the base of a tree and tried to make him understand.","他不敢带着狗继续靠近，于是顺着风向把狗带回到一棵树脚下，强迫它蹲下，试图让它领会其中的意思。"
"He thought the dog would stay and he did but when David moved up toward the bulk of the elephant again he felt the wet muzzle against the hollow of his knee.","他想那狗应该会呆在那里的，那狗也确实留下了，可当他朝那头公象走去的时候，却又感觉到狗湿湿的鼻头撞到了他的膝弯。"
"The two of them followed the elephant until he came to an opening in the trees.","他俩跟随着大象，直到来到树林中的一块空地上。"
"He stood there moving his huge ears.","大象站在那里甩动着它的大耳朵。"
"His bulk was in the shadow but the moonlight would be on his head.","庞大的身躯罩在树影里，但是月光仍然照在了它的头上。"
"David reached behind him and closed the dog’s jaws gently with his hand and then moved softly and unbreathing to his right along the edge of the night breeze, feeling it on his cheek, edging with it, never letting it get between him and the bulk until he could see the elephant’s head and the great ears slowly moving.","戴维来到大象身后，用手轻轻地把狗的嘴巴合上，然后屏住呼吸，侧身擦着迎面的晚风缓缓地向大象的右边移动，感觉到风拂面而过。戴维紧贴着大象的身躯前移，几乎不留一点儿空隙，终于看到大象的头和缓慢甩动的巨大耳朵。"
"The right tusk was as thick as his own thigh and it curved down almost to the ground.","它右边的象牙就和戴维的大腿一样粗，向下弯曲几乎要触到地面了。"
"He and Kibo moved back, the wind on his neck now, and they back-tracked out of the forest and into the open park country.","戴维和基博退了回来，这时风都吹到脖子上了。他们沿原路返回走出森林，来到了狩猎区空旷的野地。"
"The dog was ahead of him now and he stopped where David had left the two hunting spears by the trail when they had followed the elephant.","这个时候，狗跑在了戴维的前面，然后在两支猎矛处停了下来，这猎矛是戴维在跟随大象足迹时留下的。"
"He swung them over his shoulder in their thong and leather cup harness and, with his best spear that he had kept with him all the time in his hand, they started on the trail for the shamba.","他提起猎矛上的皮圈皮套，往肩上一背，手上拿着从不离手的、最称心的长矛，带上狗开始循着大象的足迹向庄地行进。"
"The moon was high now and he wondered why there was no drumming from the shamba.","月亮已经升得很高了，为什么庄地却没有鼓声？他感到很疑惑。"
"Something was strange if his father was there and there was no drumming.","如果父亲在那里却没有鼓声，那就很奇怪了。"
"David had felt the tiredness as soon as they had picked up the trail again.","当他们再次找到象迹时，戴维已感觉浑身疲惫。"
"For a long time he had been fresher and in better shape than the two men and impatient with their slow trailing and the regular halts his father made each hour on the hour.","一直以来他比两个大人的体力都好，更精力充沛，看到他们慢步行进，父亲每小时都定点停息，戴维总是不耐烦。"
"He could have moved ahead much faster than Juma and his father but when he started to tire they were the same as ever and at noon they took only the usual five-minute rest and he had seen that Juma was increasing the pace a little.","他本可以走得比朱玛和他父亲快很多，但当他开始感到疲累的时候，他们却一如往常，面不改色，中午也只是照常休息了五分钟，并且他发现朱玛的步伐似乎加快了一些。"
"Perhaps he wasn’t.","或许他并没有加快。"
"Perhaps it had only seemed faster but the elephant dung was fresher now although it was not warm yet to the touch.","或许只是看上去快了些，但是此时的象粪已经新鲜多了，尽管摸上去没有一点儿热气。"
"Juma gave him the rifle to carry after they came upon the last pile of dung but after an hour he looked at him and took it back.","当他们来到最后一堆象粪前时，朱玛把步枪交给戴维背。可过了一个钟头，朱玛看了看他，又把枪拿了回去。"
"They had been climbing steadily across a slope of the mountain but now the trail went down and from a gap in the forest he saw broken country ahead.","他们本是沿着一个山坡平稳地向上爬，但是现在象迹向下延伸去，透过森林的缝隙，他看到前面起伏不平的冈峦。"
"“Here’s where the tough part starts, Davey.”","“戴维，从这儿开始路就难走了。”"
"his father said.","父亲说道。"
"It was then he knew that he should have been sent back to the shamba once he had put them on the trail.","他这才意识到，当他带他们找到象迹的时候，他就应该被打发回庄地的。"
"Juma had known it for a long time.","这一点朱玛早就知道了。"
"His father knew it now and there was nothing to be done.","他的父亲现在也明白了，但却也无计可施。"
"It was another of his mistakes and there was nothing to do now except gamble.","他又犯了个错误，现在除了冒险也别无选择。"
"David looked down at the big flattened circle of the print of the elephant’s foot and saw where the bracken had been pressed down and where a broken stem of a weed was drying.","戴维低头看着那又圆又大的、扁平的大象足迹，只见欧洲蕨都被踩倒了，还有一颗踏断的杂草都快要干枯了。"
"Juma picked it up and looked at the sun.","朱玛捡起杂草，然后看了看太阳。"
"Juma handed the broken weed to David’s father and his father rolled it in his fingers.","他把断草递给了戴维的父亲，戴维的父亲将草绕在了手指上。"
"David noticed the white flowers that were drooped and dying.","戴维注意到草茎上的白花都蔫掉了，快要死了。"
"But they still had not dried in the sun nor shed their petals.","但是它们还没有被太阳晒枯，花瓣也没有掉落。"
"“It’s going to be a bitch,” his father said.","“太好了，”他父亲说，"
"“Let’s get going.”","“我们快跟上。”"
"Late in the afternoon they were still tracking through the broken country.","直到傍晚时分他们仍然在崎岖的山路上追踪着。"
"He had been sleepy now for a long time and as he watched the two men he knew that sleepiness was his real enemy and he followed their pace and tried to move through and out of the sleep that deadened him.","戴维已经昏昏欲睡很久了，当他看向那两个大人时，他意识到困倦才是他真正的敌人。他跟随着他们的步伐，努力地挪着脚步，以此来驱逐令他变得迟钝的睡意。"
"The two men relieved each other tracking on the hour and the one who was in second place looked back at him at regular intervals to check if he was with them.","两个大人每小时轮流替换在前追寻象迹，后面的人每隔一定时间就回头看看他有没有跟上。"
"When they made a dry camp at dark in the forest he went to sleep as soon as he sat down and woke with Juma holding his moccasins and feeling his bare feet for blisters.","夜晚，当他们在这森林的无水地露营时，戴维一坐下来就睡着了，醒来时就看到朱玛拎着鹿皮靴，抚摸着光脚看有没有水泡。"
"His father had spread his coat over him and was sitting by him with a piece of cold cooked meat and two biscuits.","父亲已经将外套盖在了他身上，正坐在他旁边，手里拿着一块冷的熟肉和两块饼干，"
"He offered him a water bottle with cold tea.","递给他一个装着冷茶的水瓶。"
"“He’ll have to feed, Davey,” his father said.","“大象也要吃东西的，戴维，”父亲说，"
"“Your feet are in good shape.","“你的脚没事。"
"They’re as sound as Juma’s.","就和朱玛的一样结实。"
"Eat this slowly and drink some tea and go to sleep again.","你慢慢吃，然后喝点儿茶再睡觉吧。"
"We haven’t any problems.”","我们不会有什么问题的。”"
"“I’m sorry I was so sleepy.”","“很抱歉，我实在是太困了。”"
"“You and Kibo hunted and traveled all last night.","“昨晚你和基博寻找象迹奔走了整个晚上。"
"Why shouldn’t you be sleepy?","怎么会不累呢？"
"You can have a little more meat if you want it.”","你想吃的话就多吃点儿肉吧。”"
"“I’m not hungry.”","“我不饿。”"
"“Good.","“好吧。"
"We’re good for three days.","我们可以坚持三天。"
"We’ll hit water again tomorrow.","明天又可以找到水源了。"
"Plenty of creeks come off the mountain.”","山上有充足的泉水。”"
"“Where’s he going?”","“大象是要去哪呢？”"
"“Juma thinks he knows.”","“朱玛觉得他大概知道。”"
"“Isn’t it bad?”","“那情况糟糕吗？”"
"“Not too bad, Davey.”","“不会很糟糕的，戴维。”"
"“I’m going back to sleep,” David had said.","“我又想睡觉了，”戴维说道，"
"“I don’t need your coat.”","“我不需要你的外套。”"
"“Juma and I are all right,” his father said.","“我和朱玛能对付，”父亲说道，"
"“I always sleep warm you know.”","“你知道，我睡觉总是不怕冷的。”"
"David was asleep even before his father said good night.","父亲还没来得及说晚安，戴维他就睡着了。"
"Then he woke once with the moonlight on his face and he thought of the elephant with his great ears moving as he stood in the forest, his head hung down with the weight of the tusks.","后来他又醒了一次，发现月光洒在自己的脸上，他想起了大象在森林中的场景：煽动着巨耳，头因象牙的重量而往下垂着。"
"David thought then in the night that the hollow way he felt as he remembered him was from waking hungry.","戴维觉得夜里想到大象时所感觉到的空虚，是由于睡醒时的饥饿造成的。"
"But it was not and he found that out in the next three days.","但事实并非如此，他在接下来的三天中才意识到。"
"The next day was very bad because long before noon he knew that it was not just the need for sleep that made the difference between a boy and men.","第二天情况很糟糕，因为还远没到中午，他就意识到大人跟孩子的差别不仅仅是需要多睡会儿的问题。"
"For the first three hours he was fresher than they were and he asked Juma for the .303 rifle to carry but Juma shook his head.","头三个小时戴维比他们有精神，他请求朱玛将点三零三口径的枪给他背，但是朱玛摇了摇头。"
"He did not smile and he had always been David’s best friend and had taught him to hunt.","脸上没有一丝笑容，他可一直是戴维最好的朋友，还教会了戴维打猎。"
"He offered it to me yesterday, David thought, and I’m in better shape today than I was then.","戴维心想，昨天他还把枪交给我背了，而且我今天的精神比昨天好多了。"
"He was, too, but by ten o’clock he knew the day would be as bad or worse than the day before.","他的精神的确是好多了，但是才到十点他也就意识到今天可能跟昨天一样糟，甚至比昨天更糟。"
"It was as silly for him to think that he could trail with his father as to think he could fight with him.","对他来说，想跟上父亲的步伐，就跟他想和父亲干上一架一样，是个十分愚蠢的想法。"
"He knew too that it was not just that they were men.","他也知道那并不仅仅是因为他们是大人。"
"They were professional hunters and he knew now that was why Juma would not even waste a smile.","他们是专业猎人，他现在知道为什么朱玛连一个笑容都很吝啬了。"
"They knew everything the elephant had done, pointed out the signs of it to each other without speaking, and when the tracking became difficult his father always yielded to Juma.","他们知道大象的一举一动，不用言语，只需用手指一指就能让对方知道是大象的足迹，当追踪变得困难时，父亲总是听朱玛的。"
"When they stopped to fill the water bottles at a stream his father said, “Just last the day out, Davey.”","当他们在泉边停下装水时，父亲说：“只要够今天喝就行了，戴维。”"
"Then when they were past the broken country and climbing toward the forest the tracks of the elephant turned off to the right onto an old elephant trail.","后来崎岖的山路终于走完了，他们开始向森林攀爬，这时，大象的足迹转向了右边，通到一条旧的象迹上。"
"He saw his father and Juma talking and when he got up to them Juma was looking back over the way they had come and then at a far distant stony island of hills in the dry country and seemed to be taking a bearing of this against the peaks of three far blue hills on the horizon.","他看到朱玛和父亲在说着什么，当他走近时，朱玛回头看了看他们来时的路，然后又望了望远处无水地带几座如僻岩孤岛般的小山，似乎正在以远处地平线上的三座青山顶来测定方位。"
"“Juma knows where he’s going now,” his father explained.","“现在朱玛知道大象往哪儿去了，”父亲解释说，"
"“He thought he knew before but then he dropped down into this stuff.”","“他本来以为自己知道，但是大象却转向绕了这一大圈。”"
"He looked back at the country they had come through all day.","父亲回头望了望他们整整一天所走过的路。"
"“Where he’s headed now is pretty good going but we’ll have to climb.”","“现在大象所走的路比较平坦好走了，但是我们还得爬坡。”"
"They climbed until it was dark and then made another dry camp.","他们一直爬着山坡，直到天黑，然后又就地露营。"
"David killed two spur fowl with his slingshot out of a small flock that had walked across the trail just before the sunset.","就在日落前不久，一小群鹧鸪从象径上横穿而过，戴维用弹弓射中了两只。"
"The birds had come into the old elephant trail to dust, walking neatly and plumply, and when the pebble broke the back of one and the bird began to jerk and toss with its wings thumping, another bird ran forward to peck at it and David pouched another pebble and pulled it back and sent it against the ribs of the second bird.","那群胖墩墩的鹧鸪潇洒地踏上了老象径，整齐阔步地走着，扬起了阵阵尘土。其中一只小鹧鸪的背被石子打断了，它拍打着翅膀开始挣扎扑腾，另一只鹧鸪跑过来想用嘴救它，戴维又装上一颗石子，往后一拉，打中这只鹧鸪的肋骨。"
"As he ran forward to put his hand on it the other birds whirred off.","当他跑过去捡的时候，其他的鹧鸪呼呼地飞走了。"
"Juma had looked back and smiled this time and David picked up the two birds, warm and plump and smoothly feathered, and knocked their heads against the handle of his hunting knife.","朱玛回过头来看了看，这次还露出了笑容。戴维捡起那两只鸟，都是胖墩墩、热乎乎的，羽毛还很平整。他用猎刀刀柄敲了几下鸟的脑袋。"
"Now where they were camped for the night his father said, “I’ve never seen that type of francolin quite so high.","到了他们夜晚露营的地方，父亲说：“我从来没见过这么大的鹧鸪。"
"You did very well to get a double on them.”","你能连中两只，干得真不错！”"
"Juma cooked the birds spitted on a stick over the coals of a very small fire.","朱玛将鹧鸪串在枝条上，放在很小的炭火上烤。"
"His father drank a whiskey and water from the cup top on his flask as they lay and watched Juma cook.","他和父亲躺在那里，看着朱玛烤鹧鸪，父亲往长颈瓶瓶盖里倒了些威士忌，惨了点儿水，在那里喝着。"
"Afterward Juma gave them each a breast with the heart in it and ate the two necks and backs and the legs himself.","后来朱玛把胸脯肉和鹧鸪心分给他们一人一份，自己吃了两份颈背和鹧鸪腿。"
"“It makes a great difference, Davey,” his father said.","“这可帮了大忙，戴维，”父亲说道，"
"“We’re very well off on rations now.”","“这下我们的干粮就很宽裕了。”"
"“How far are we behind him?”","“我们离大象还有多远？”"
"David asked.","戴维问道。"
"“We’re quite close,” his father said.","“已经很近了，”父亲说，"
"“it depends on whether he travels when the moon comes up.","“这要看大象在月亮出来后还走不走。"
"It’s an hour later tonight and two hours later than when you found him.”","今天晚上月亮上山比昨天晚一个钟头，比你找到它那天晚了两个钟头。”"
"“Why does Juma think he knows where he’s going?”","“为什么朱玛会认为他知道大象的去向呢？”"
"“He wounded him and killed his askari not too far from here.”","“他就在离这儿不远的地方打伤过大象，而且还杀死了它的‘部下’。”"
"“When?”","“什么时候？”"
"“Five years ago, he says.","“他说是五年前，"
"That may mean anytime.","也可能是另外的某个时候。"
"When you were still a toto he says.”","他说那时你还是一个娃娃。”"
"“Has he been alone since then?”","“从那时起他就没再见过那头大象吗？”"
"“He says so.","“他是这样说的，"
"He hasn’t seen him.","再也没有见过它，"
"Only heard of him.”","只是听说过它。”"
"“How big does he say he is?”","“他说那头大象有多大？”"
"“Close to two hundred.","“接近两百磅。"
"Bigger than anything I’ve ever seen.","比我所见过的所有动物都大。"
"He says there’s only been one greater elephant and he came from near here too.”","他说比这还大的大象只有过一只，也出没在这附近。”"
"“I’d better get to sleep,” David said.","“我还是睡觉吧，”戴维说，"
"“I hope I’ll be better tomorrow.”","“希望我明天会好些。”"
"“You were splendid today,” his father said.","“你今天已经做得很好了，”父亲说，"
"“I was very proud of you.","“我真为你感到骄傲！"
"So was Juma.”","朱玛也一样！”"
"In the night when he woke after the moon was up he was sure they were not proud of him except perhaps for his dexterity in killing the two birds.","夜晚，当他醒来时，月亮已经升得很高了，他确信他们并不为自己感到骄傲，也许只是除了他敏捷地抓住了两只鹧鸪之外。"
"He had found the elephant at night and followed him to see that he had both of his tusks and then returned to find the two men and put them on the trail.","他在夜里发现了大象，跟踪它，看到了它的两只大象牙都还在，然后回来找到了父亲和朱玛，带着他们踏上了象径。"
"David knew they were proud of that.","戴维知道他们也为那也让他们感到骄傲。"
"But once the deadly following started he was useless to them and a danger to their success just as Kibo had been to him when he had gone up close to the elephant in the night, and he knew they must each have hated themselves for not having sent him back when there was time.","然而艰难的追踪一开始，他就成了他们的累赘，甚至会对他们的成功构成威胁，就像他夜里想靠近大象时，基博会妨碍他一样。而且他知道他们两个肯定都在埋怨自己，在可以让他回去的时候没有叫他回去。"
"The tusks of the elephant weighed two hundred pounds apiece.","那头大象的每只象牙都有两百磅重。"
"Ever since these tusks had grown beyond their normal size the elephant had been hunted for them and now the three of them would kill him for them.","当象牙长到超过一定长度以后，那头大象就因为它的牙而一直遭到猎杀。而现在他们三个想杀它，也就是为了象牙。"
"David was sure that they would kill him now because he, David, had lasted through the day and kept up after the pace had destroyed him by noon.","戴维确信他们这次会杀了它，因为戴维他已经坚持了一整天，尽管在快到中午的时候自己已经累垮了，他还是紧跟着他们的步子。"
"So they probably were proud of him doing that.","所以他们可能也因为他坚持下来了而感到骄傲吧。"
"But he had brought nothing useful to the hunt and they would have been far better off without him.","但是他对这次猎杀行动毫无用处，况且如果没有他，他们可能会做得好得多。"
"Many times during the day he had wished that he had never betrayed the elephant and in the afternoon he remembered wishing that he had never seen him.","白天的时候，他曾多次希望自己并没有说出来大象的踪迹，每到下午，他又希望自己从未见到过它。"
"Awake in the moonlight he knew that was not true.","当他在月光中醒来时，，他很明了这其实并不是他真正的想法。"
"The next morning they were following the spoor of the elephant on an old elephant trail that was a hard-packed worn road through the forest.","第二天早上，他们又跟着大象的足迹，大象是沿着一条横穿树林的旧象径行进，这条象径很硬实。"
"It looked as though elephants had traveled it ever since the lava had cooled from the mountain and the trees had first grown tall and close.","看样子，似乎自从山上的熔岩冷却，树林开始长得高大密集后，象群就开始走这条路了。"
"Juma was very confident and they moved fast.","朱玛非常有信心，所以他们走得很快。"
"Both his father and Juma seemed very sure of themselves and the going on the elephant road was so easy that Juma gave him the .303 to carry as they went on through the broken light of the forest.","他的父亲和朱玛看上去都充满了自信，象径也很好走，朱玛还把那支点三零三给他背着，他们在有零星光线的树林中穿行。"
"Then they lost the trail in smoking piles of fresh dung and the flat round prints of a herd of elephants that had come onto the elephant road from the heavy forest on the left of the trail.","后来他们跟丢了，眼前是还冒着热气的几堆新鲜象粪，还有一些又圆又大的象群脚印从左侧的密林一直通到象径上。"
"Juma had taken the .303 from David angrily.","朱玛生气地从戴维手里拿回了点三零三。"
"It was afternoon before they worked up to the herd and around it, seeing the gray bulks through the trees and the movement of the big ears and the searching trunks coiling and uncoiling, hearing the crash of branches broken, the crash of trees pushed over, the rumbling in the bellies of the elephants and the slap and thud of the dung falling.","直到下午，他们终于找到了象群，并且离得很近了。透过树林他们看到了那些灰色的大块头们，它们扇动着大耳朵，象鼻卷起又放下，四处探寻着什么。只听见树枝断裂，树木被推倒的咔嚓声、轰隆声，大象的肚子隆隆作响的声音，以及象粪落地砰砰啪啪的声音。"
"They had found the trail of the old bull finally and when it turned off onto a smaller elephant road Juma had looked at David’s father and grimed showing his filed teeth and his father had nodded his head.","他们终于找到了这头老象的足迹！足迹转向了一条较窄的象路。朱玛看了一眼戴维的父亲，咧嘴一笑，露出了一口黄牙，他的父亲也心照不宣地点了点头。"
"They looked as though they had a dirty secret, just as they had looked when he had found them that night at the shamba.","他俩仿佛有不可告人的秘密似的，跟那天晚上他在庄地上找到他们时的表情一样。"
"It was not very long before they came on the secret.","没过多久，他们就解开了这个秘密。"
"It was off to the right in the forest and the tracks of the old bull led to it.","秘密就藏在森林的右侧，那头老公象的足迹刚好通向那里。"
"It was a skull as high as David’s chest and white from the sun and the rain.","那是一个骷髅头，有戴维的胸部那么高，经过日晒雨淋已经发白了。"
"There was a deep depression in the forehead and a ridge ran from between the bare white eye sockets and flared out in empty broken holes where the tusks had been chopped away.","前额有很深的凹陷，发白的裸露眼窝间是一条隆起，向空空的破洞延展开去，洞里的象牙已经被割走了。"
"Juma pointed out where the great elephant they were trailing had stood while he looked down at the skull and where his trunk had moved it a little way from the place it had rested on the ground and where the points of his tusks had touched the ground beside it.","朱玛低头看着骷髅头，指出他们追踪的那头大象所站过的地方，是它用象鼻把本在那边地上的骷髅头移到这里来的，它的象牙还在边上留下了一些印记。"
"He showed David the single hole in the big depression in the white bone of the forehead and then the four holes close together in the bone around the earhole.","他还指给戴维看：骷髅头前额白骨里的大凹陷有一个洞，而耳孔旁边的骨头里有四个洞连在一起。"
"He grinned at David and at his father and took a .303 solid from his pocket arid fitted the nose into the hole in the bone of the forehead.","他冲戴维和戴维的父亲咧嘴笑了笑，从口袋里拿出了一颗点三零三的子弹，把弹头塞进了前额骨头的洞里。"
"“Here is where Juma wounded the big bull,” his father said.","“朱玛就是在这儿打伤那头大公象的，”父亲说，"
"“This was his askari.","“这是它的‘部下’。"
"His friend, really, because he was a big bull too.","他的伙伴，真的，因为它也是一头大公象。"
"He charged and Juma knocked him down and finished him in the ear.”","它冲向朱玛，朱玛一枪把它打倒，又在它的耳朵上打了几枪，要了它的命。”"
"Juma was pointing out the scattered bones and how the big bull had walked among them.","朱玛指着满地的碎骨，指出那头大公象是怎样在这些骨头间走来走去的。"
"Juma and David’s father were both very pleased with what they had found.","朱玛和戴维的父亲对他们发现感到很满意。"
"“How long do you suppose he and his friend had been together?”","“你觉得它和它的伙伴在一起多久了？”"
"David asked his father.","戴维问父亲。"
"“I haven’t the faintest idea.” his father said.","“我一点儿都不知道，”父亲说，"
"“Ask Juma.”","“去问朱玛吧。”"
"“You ask him, please.”","“你去问他吧。”"
"His father and Juma spoke together and Juma had looked at David and laughed.","父亲和朱玛交谈了一会儿，朱玛看了看戴维，笑了。"
"“Probably four or five times your life, he says,” David’s father told him.","“他说，可能是你年龄的四五倍吧，”父亲告诉戴维，"
"“He doesn’t know or care really.”","“事实上，他不知道，也不在意。”"
"I care, David thought.","可我在意，戴维心想，"
"I saw him in the moonlight and he was alone but I had Kibo.","我在月光下看到它，它是孤独的，而我有基博作伴，"
"Kibo has me too.","基博也有我作伴。"
"The bull wasn’t doing any harm and now we’ve tracked him to where he came to see his dead friend and now we’re going to kill him.","那头大公象并没有伤害到谁，而我们却一直跟踪它，现在它来这里看望死去的伙伴，我们也跟来了，并且我们还要杀了它。"
"It’s my fault.","都是我的错，"
"I betrayed him.","是我出卖了它。"
"Now Juma had worked out the trail and motioned to his father and they started on.","现在朱玛找到了象迹，向戴维的父亲打了个手势，他们就出发了。"
"My father doesn’t need to kill elephants to live, David thought.","父亲并不需要以猎杀大象谋生，戴维心想，"
"Juma would not have found him if I had not seen him.","如果我没看见过它，朱玛也不会找到它。"
"He had his chance at him and all he did was wound him and kill his friend.","他以前就有幸遇见过这头大象，可是他所做的却是把它打伤，并且杀害了它的伙伴。"
"Kibo and I found him and I never should have told them and I should have kept him secret and had him always and let them stay drunk at the beer shamba.","基博和我发现了它，我真不该告诉他们，我应该永远保守秘密，由他们在酒馆喝得烂醉。"
"Juma was so drunk we could not wake him.","当时朱玛醉醺醺的，我们根本都叫不醒他。"
"I’m going to keep everything a secret always.","我以后一定要对所有事情保密。"
"I’ll never tell them anything again.","我再也不会告诉他们任何事情了。"
"If they kill him Juma will drink his share of the ivory or just buy himself another goddamn wife.","如果这次他们杀死了它，朱玛会用他那份卖象牙的钱全用来买酒喝，或者再给自己买个臭婆娘。"
"Why didn’t you help the elephant when you could?","你力所能及的时候，干嘛不帮帮大象呢？"
"All you had to do was not go on the second day.","你所要做的就是第二天不走了。"
"No, that wouldn’t have stopped them.","不，那样阻止不了他们。"

"You never should have told them.","你就不该告诉他们的，"
"Never, never tell them.","完完全全不应该。"
"Try and remember that.","要努力记住这个教训。"

"He’s not traveling as he was.","不再像之前那样赶路了。"
"We’ll be up on him anytime now.”","我们现在随时可以追上它。”"
"“Fuck elephant hunting,” David had said very quietly.","“打象打象，打个屁象。”戴维轻轻地说。"
"“What’s that?” his father asked.","“你说什么？”父亲问。"
"“Fuck elephant hunting,” David said softly.","“打个屁象啊！”戴维轻轻地说。"
"“Be careful you don’t fuck it up,” his father had said to him and looked at him flatly.","“你可小心点儿，别把事情搞砸了。”父亲对他说道，还狠狠地瞪了他一眼。"

"In the morning he was on the far slope of the mountain again.","早上，大象远远地站在山的斜坡上。"
"The elephant was no longer traveling as he had been but was moving aimlessly now, feeding occasionally and David had known they were getting close to him.","那头大象不再像以前那样赶路了，现在只是漫无目的地走着，偶尔吃点儿东西，戴维知道已经离它不远了。"
"He tried to remember how he had felt.","他试着回忆一路来的感受。"
"He had no love for the elephant yet.","他还谈不上是喜爱这头大象，"
"He must remember that.","他必须记住这一点。"
"He had only a sorrow that had come from his own tiredness that had brought an understanding of age.","只是由于自己的疲劳，他感到难过，并且产生了一种对年老的理解。"
"Through being too young, he had learned how it must be to be too old.","虽然很年轻，他体会到了年老应该是什么感受。"
"He was lonesome for Kibo and thinking of how Juma killing the elephant’s friend had turned him against Juma and made the elephant his brother.","他感到落寞，想念基博，想到朱玛是怎样杀死那头大象的伙伴，这使他讨厌起朱玛来，觉得那头大象似乎成了他的手足兄弟。"
"He knew then how much it meant to him to have seen the elephant in the moonlight and to have followed him and come close to him in the clearing so that he had seen the great tusks.","他这才意识到，那天在月光下发现大象，一路跟踪，在空地上靠近它，并看清了那两颗大象牙，对他来说影响是多么大。"
"But he did not know that nothing would ever be as good as that again.","但是他并不知道，不会再有什么事会和这件事一样有这么深远的影响。"
"Now he knew they would kill the elephant and there was nothing he could do about it.","现在他知道他们会杀了那头大象，而自己却无能为力。"
"He had betrayed the elephant when he had gone back to tell them at the shamba.","当他回到庄地向他们报告时，他就已经出卖那头大象了。"
"They would kill me and they would kill Kibo if we had ivory, he had thought, and known it was untrue.","如果我和基博有象牙，他们也会杀掉我们的，他心想，尽管他知道这是不可能的。"
"Probably the elephant is going to find where he was born and they’ll kill him there.","也许那头大象是去找它的出生地，而他们就会在那里杀掉它。"
"That’s all they’d need to make it perfect.","这对他们来说再好不过了。"
"They’d like to have killed him where they killed his friend.","他们本想在杀害它伙伴的地方就把它干掉的，"
"That would be a big joke.","那样的话就太好笑了，"
"That would have pleased them.","就太如他们的意了。"
"The goddamned friend killers.","这些杀害别人伙伴的混蛋！"
"They had moved to the edge of thick cover now and the elephant was close ahead.","他们现在已经到了茂密树林的边了，那头大象就在前头，近得很。"
"David could smell him and they could all hear him pulling down branches and the snapping that they made.","戴维已经能闻到它的气味了，他们都听到它折断树枝的咔嚓声。"
"His father put his hand on David’s shoulder to move him back and have him wait outside and then he took a big pinch of ashes from the pouch in his pocket and tossed it in the air.","父亲一把抓住戴维的肩膀，把他拽了回来，让他待在外面。然后从衣服口袋里掏出一个小袋子，从里面取出一大撮灰，弹向空中。"
"The ash barely slanted toward them as it fell and his father nodded at Juma and bent down to follow him into the thick cover.","灰散落下来的时候，有少量飘向他们，父亲冲朱玛点了点头，然后弯腰跟着他进了密林深处。"
"David watched their backs and their asses go in and out of sight.","戴维看着他们的后背和屁股一下子就钻了进去，消失不见了。"
"He could not hear them move.","他听不到一点儿走动的声音。"
"David had stood still and listened to the elephant feeding.","戴维静静地站着，听着大象吃东西的声音。"
"He could smell him as strongly as he had the night in the moonlight when he had worked up close to him and had seen his wonderful tusks.","他闻到了大象的气味，跟那晚在月光下靠近它，看到它那美妙的象牙时一样浓烈。"
"Then as he stood there it was silent and he could not smell the elephant.","后来他又在那里站了一会儿，周围静悄悄的，他也闻不到大象的气味了。"
"Then there had been a high squealing and smashing and a shot by the .303, then the heavy rocking double report of his father’s .450, then the smashing and crashing had gone on going steadily away and he had gone into the heavy growth and found Juma shaken and bleeding from his forehead all down over his face and his father white and angry.","接着听到一声刺耳的尖叫和“砰”的一声，那支点三零三一声枪响，接着是父亲那支点四五零的两声地动山摇的响声，后来是轰隆声、劈啪声响个不停，不过渐渐远去了。他走进密林，发现朱玛在发抖，鲜血顺着前额淌下，流得满脸都是，父亲脸色苍白，十分气恼。"
"“He went for Juma and knocked him over,” his father had said.","“它冲向朱玛，把他撞倒了，”父亲说，"
"“Juma hit him in the head.”","“朱玛的头被它撞了一下。”"
"“Where did you hit him?”","“你打它哪儿了？”"
"“Where I fucking well could,” his father had said.","“他妈的，哪里好打我就打哪儿了，”他的父亲说，"
"“Get on the blood spoor.”","“去沿着血迹找！”"
"There was plenty of blood.","地上有很多血。"
"One stream as high as David’s head that had squirted bright on trunks and leaves and vines and another much lower that was dark and foul with stomach content.","有一股鲜红的血喷了出来，有戴维的头那么高，溅在树干、树叶和树藤上；另外一股血低多了，黑黑的，臭臭的，夹杂着胃里没有消化完的东西。"
"“Lung and gut shot,” his father said.","“肺和内脏都被抢打中了，”父亲说，"
"“We’ll find him down or anchored—I hope the hell,” he added.","“我们找到它时，它要么倒下了，要么停下不走了。我希望是这样！”他补充道。"
"They found him anchored, in such suffering and despair that he could no longer move.","他们找到它时，它确实已经停了下来，它很痛苦，很绝望，再也走不动了。"
"He had crashed through the heavy cover where he had been feeding and crossed a path of open forest and David and his father ran along the heavily splashed blood trail.","它一路跌跌撞撞，从之前觅食的密林中跑了出来，又穿过一片稀疏树林里的小径。戴维和父亲一路沿着大摊大摊的血迹找过来了。"
"Then the elephant had gone on into thick forest and David had seen him ahead standing gray and huge against the trunk of a tree.","接着大象又钻进了密林，戴维看见了它灰色、庞大的身躯正倚着一棵树干。"
"David could only see his stern and then his father moved ahead and he followed and they came alongside the elephant as though he was a ship and David saw the blood coming from his flanks and running down his sides and then his father raised his rifle and fired and the elephant turned his head with the great tusks moving heavy and slow and looked at them and when his father fired the second barrel the elephant seemed to sway like a felled tree and came smashing down toward them.","戴维只看得见它的屁股，接着父亲向前走去，他也跟了上去。他们来到大象身边，它的身躯像一条大船似的。戴维看见它的腹部还冒着血，顺着身体流下来。接着父亲举起枪来开了一枪，那头大象慢慢地、吃力地转过两只长长的象牙，回头看着他们。这时父亲又开了一枪，大象似乎晃了一下，犹如一棵被砍断的树，轰的一声朝他们这边倒下了。"
"But he was not dead.","但是它没有死。"
"He had been anchored and now he was down with his shoulder broken.","现在它倒下了，动不了了，肩胛骨被打碎了。"
"He did not move but his eye was alive and looked at David.","它不动了，但它的眼睛神充满活力地看着戴维。"
"He had very long eyelashes and his eye was the most alive thing David had ever seen.","它的睫毛特别长，灵动的眼睛是戴维所见过的最有活力的东西。"
"“Shoot him in the earhole with the three oh three,” his father said.","“拿那把点三零三的枪对准它的耳朵打！”他父亲说，"
"“Go on.”","“打呀！”"
"“You shoot him,” David had said.","“要打你自己打！”戴维说。"
"Juma had come up limping and bloody, the skin of his forehead hanging down over his left eye, the bone of his nose showing and one ear torn and had taken the rifle from David without speaking and pushed the muzzle almost into the earhole and fired twice, jerking the bolt and driving it forward angrily.","朱玛腿上流着血，一瘸一拐地走来了。他额头上的破皮掉下来遮住了左眼，鼻子露出了骨头，一只耳朵也被撕裂了，他一言不发，从戴维手里夺过猎枪，把枪口几乎塞进大象的耳洞里，猛地把枪栓一推一拉，气冲冲地连开了两枪。"
"The eye of the elephant had opened wide on the first shot and then started to glaze and blood came out of the ear and ran in two bright streams down the wrinkled gray hide.","开第一枪的时候，大象的眼睛还睁得大大的，随即便渐渐失去了光彩；耳朵里冒出了血，两道鲜红的血流顺着它布满皱纹的灰色象皮纹理直往下淌。"
"It was different colored blood and David had thought I must remember that and he had but it had never been of any use to him.","这个血的颜色不一样。戴维暗暗思忖：我得记住这个颜色。他的确记住了，可是这对他毫无意义。"
"Now all the dignity and majesty and all the beauty were gone from the elephant and he was a huge wrinkled pile.","此时大象所有的威严气概、翩翩风度已经荡然无存，只剩下一堆皱巴巴的皮肉。"
"“Well, we got him, Davey, thanks to you,” his father had said.","“好啦，总算到手了。戴维，多亏了你，”父亲说道，"
"“Now we’d better get a fire going so I can put Juma back together again.","“现在我们最好生堆火，让我给朱玛疗疗伤。"
"Come here, you bloody Humpty Dumpty.","快过来，你这个受伤的汉普蒂－邓普蒂。"
"Those tusks will keep.”","那些象牙先放着。”"
"Juma had come to him grinning, bringing the tail of the elephant that had no hairs on it at all.","朱玛笑嘻嘻地来到他跟前，手上还拿着那只大象的尾巴，上面一点儿毛也没有。"
"They had made a dirty joke and then his father had begun to speak rapidly in Swahili.","他们说了一个黄色笑话，接着父亲开始用斯瓦希里语说了起来，语速飞快。"
"How far to water?","这里离水源有多远？"
"How far will you have to go to get people to get those tusks out of here?","要走多远才能找到人把这些象牙运出去？"
"How are you, you worthless old pig fucker?","你这个没用的混蛋猪头，情况到底怎么样了？"
"What have you broken?","伤到哪里了？"
"With the answers known his father had said, “You and I will go back to get the packs where we dropped them.","唠叨完这些后，父亲对戴维说：“你待会儿跟我一起回去把扔下的背包找回来。"
"Juma can get wood and have the fire ready.","朱玛捡些柴火把火生好。"
"The medical kit is in my pack.","医药箱在我的包里。"
"We have to get the packs before it’s dark.","我们必须在天黑以前找到那些背包。"
"He won’t infect.","他的伤不会感染的。"
"It’s not like claw wounds.","这不是抓伤，不要紧。"
"Let’s go.”","我们走吧。”"
"That evening as David had sat by the fire he had looked at Juma with his stitched-up face and his broken ribs and wondered if the elephant had recognized him when he had tried to kill him.","那天晚上，当戴维坐在火堆旁，望着脸上缝了许多针、肋骨也断了几根的朱玛，心里寻思着，大象是不是认出了朱玛，所以才想干掉他呢？"
"He hoped he had.","他希望如此。"
"The elephant was his hero now as his father had been for a long time and he had thought, I didn’t believe he could do it when he was so old and tired.","现在大象成了他心目中的英雄了，正如长久以来父亲在他心中的英雄形象一样。他心想：那头大象已经那么老，那么累，还敢这么做，简直难以置信。"
"He would have killed Juma, too.","它本来是可以杀死朱玛的。"
"But he didn’t look at me as though he wanted to kill me.","但是它看我的眼神看里，似乎并没有要伤害我的意思。"
"He only looked sad the same way I felt.","它只是和我一样流露出难过的样子。"
"He visited his old friend on the day he died.","在临死的那天，它还看望了它的老朋友。"
"David remembered how the elephant lost all dignity as soon as his eye had ceased to be alive and how when his father and he had returned with the packs the elephant had already started to swell, even in the cool evening.","戴维不会忘记，那头大象一旦失去生命的活力，它那副尊贵的威严也就随之消逝了。他也不会忘记，等到他和父亲找到背包回来时，大象已经开始变肿，即便是在这凉爽的夜。"
"There was no more true elephant; only the gray wrinkled swelling dead body and the huge mottled brown and yellow tusks that they had killed him for.","哪里还看得出那是头大象啊！剩下的只是它那皮皱肉肿的尸体和那黄褐斑斑的大象牙，正是这对象牙害它送了命。"
"The tusks were stained with dried blood and he scraped some off with his thumbnail like a dried piece of sealing wax and put it in the pocket of his shirt.","粘在象牙上的血迹已经凝固了。他像刮干了的火漆一样，用拇指指甲刮了点儿血迹下来，放进了衬衣的口袋里。"
"That was all he took from the elephant except the beginning of the knowledge of loneliness.","除了刮下来的这些血块，他什么也没要，倒是这大象给了他一种孤寂之感。"
"After the butchery his father tried to talk to him that night by the fire.","那晚，宰割取完牙后，父亲在火堆旁想要和他说说话。"
"“He was a murderer you know, Davey,” he had said.","“戴维，大象是个杀人狂，”他说，"
"“Juma says nobody knows how many people he has killed.”","“朱玛说谁也不知道它到底害死了多少人。”"
"“They were all trying to kill him, weren’t they?”","“他们不都想猎杀它吗？”"
"“Naturally,” his father had said, “with that pair of tusks.”","“那当然，”父亲说道，“那对象牙谁都想要。”"
"“How could he be a murderer then?”","“那怎么能说它爱杀人呢？!”"
"“Just as you like,” his father had said.","“你爱怎么想就怎么想吧，”父亲说，"
"“I’m sorry you got so mixed up about him.”","“我很遗憾你对它的看法这么糊涂。”"
"“I wish he’d killed Juma,” David said.","“我真希望它那时能杀了朱玛。”戴维说。"
"“I think that’s carrying it a little far,” his father said.","“我觉得你说得有点儿过分了，”父亲说道，"
"“Juma’s your friend, you know.”","“要知道，朱玛是你的好朋友。”"
"“Not any more.”","“他再也不是我的朋友了。”"
"“No need to tell him so.”","“这种话可别对他说！”"
"“He knows it,” David had said.","“不说他也知道。”戴维说。"
"“I think you misjudge him,” his father said and they had left it there.","“我看你是误会他了，”父亲说。谈到这里，也就没再说下去了。"
"Then when they were finally back safely with the tusks after all the things that had happened and the tusks were propped against the wall of the stick and mud house, leaning there with their points touching, the tusks so tall and thick that no one could believe them even when they touched them and no one, not even his father, could reach to the top of the bend where they curved in for the points to meet, there when Juma and his father and he were heroes and Kibo was a hero’s dog and the men who had carried the tusks were heroes, already slightly drunk heroes and to be drunker, his father had said, “Do you want to make peace, Davey?”","后来，经过种种波折，他们终于带着象牙安全地回来了。两只大象牙在泥糊枝编的房子外靠着墙。象牙尖头挨着尖头斜靠在一起，那么高，那么粗，人们用手摸着都不敢相信。两个尖头上都有一个向里的弯，谁也够不到那弯的顶，就连他的父亲也不行。顿时，朱玛和他们父子俩都成了英雄，基博也成了英雄的狗，连那些扛象牙的人也都成了英雄。他们本来就已经微醉了，后来醉得更厉害了。也就在这时，父亲说：“戴维，我们和解好吗？”"
"“All right,” he said because he knew this was the start of the never telling that he had decided on.","“好吧。”他说。因为他知道，这是他决定再也不把心里话告诉别人的开始。"
"“I’m so glad,” his father said.","“太好了，”父亲说，"
"“It’s so much simpler and better.”","“这样事情就简单多了，感觉也好多了。”"
"Then they sat on old men’s stools under the shade of the fig tree with the tusks against the wall of the hut and drank beer from gourd cups that were brought by a young girl and her younger brother, the servant of heroes, sitting in the dust by the heroic dog of a hero who held an old cockerel, newly promoted to the standing of the heroes’ favorite rooster.","于是，他们坐在无花果树树阴下的长者凳上喝起啤酒来。大象牙依然在茅屋的墙上靠着，他们用葫芦杯喝着酒，那些酒杯是一个姑娘和她的弟弟送来的，他们可是为英雄而服务的仆人，也跟英雄的那头神犬一起坐在地上，那位英雄养了一只老公鸡，那只老公鸡也被升格为英雄心爱的大雄鸡。"
"They sat there and drank beer while the big drum started and the ngoma began to build.","他们就坐在那里喝着啤酒，大鼓开始敲起来了，恩戈麦鼓也擂了起来。"
