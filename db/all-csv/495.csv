"寡妇的抗议","The Widow’s Protest"
"作者：马克·吐温","by Mark Twain "
"我曾听说过的最悲惨的故事之一（听某银行职员说的）发生在战争时期的康宁城。丹·墨菲入伍时是个列兵，作战非常勇敢。战友都喜欢他。一次他负伤之后，身体渐渐虚弱。后来，扛步枪对他来说都非常吃力了，战友们就集资安排他做个军中小贩。之后，他赚了钱，但总是寄给老婆，让她帮他存到银行里。他老婆是个洗衣熨衣的女工，经历了生活的艰辛，懂得一有钱就要存起来。她自己从来不浪费一分钱。","One of the saddest things that ever came under my notice (said the banker’s clerk) was there in Corning during the war.Dan Murphy enlisted as a private, and fought very bravely.The boys all liked him, and when a wound by and by weakened him down till carrying a musket was too heavy work for him, they clubbed together and fixed him up as a sutler.He made money then, and sent it always to his wife to bank for him.She was a washer and ironer, and knew enough by hard experience to keep money when she got it.She didn’t waste a penny."
"相反，银行账户里的存款越来越多时，她反而开始变得吝啬了。花一分钱都让她痛苦万分。可怜的人啊，在她辛劳的一生中，她曾两次挨饿受冻，孤身一人，贫病交加，身无分文。她心里常常害怕会再次经历那样的痛苦。最后丹死了。为了表达对丹的尊重和关切，战友们发电报给墨菲太太，问她愿不愿意对先将丹的遗体进行防腐处理，然后再将其运回家。你要知道对待像丹这样的穷人，通常的做法是直接把遗体扔进一个浅坑里随便埋了，然后再通知他的亲友。墨菲太太粗略估计：顶多花两三美元就能把她去世的丈夫进行防腐处理，所以很快就回电报答应了。守灵的时候，防腐处理的账单到了，寡妇才看到。","On the contrary, she began to get miserly as her bank-account grew.She grieved to part with a cent, poor creature, for twice in her hard-working life she had known what it was to be hungry, cold, friendless, sick, and without a dollar in the world, and she had a haunting dread of suffering so again.Well, at last Dan died; and the boys, in testimony of their esteem and respect for him, telegraphed to Mrs. Murphy to know if she would like to have him embalmed and sent home; when you know the usual custom was to dump a poor devil like him into a shallow hole, and then inform his friends what had become of him.Mrs. Murphy jumped to the conclusion that it would only cost two or three dollars to embalm her dead husband, and so she telegraphed “Yes.”It was at the “wake” that the bill for embalming arrived and was presented to the widow."
"她发出一声疯狂的、悲惨的哀嚎，让在场的每个人为之心碎。她说道：“在丹身上涂了几下就要七十五美元啊，他们的良心给狗吃了啊！这帮混蛋以为俺要开博物馆啊，俺怎么存得起这么贵的古董啊！”","She uttered a wild, sad wail that pierced every heart, and said, “Sivinty-foive dollars for stooffin’ Dan, blister their sowls!Did thim divils suppose I was goin’ to stairt a Museim, that I’d be dalin’ in such expinsive curiassities!”"
"据银行职员说，当时屋子里无人不落泪。","The banker’s clerk said there was not a dry eye in the house."
