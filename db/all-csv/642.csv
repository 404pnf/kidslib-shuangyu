"红圈会","The Adventure of The Red Circle"
"“呃，沃伦太太，我看您并没有什么非担心不可的理由，而我也看不出来，我这么个时间也算宝贵的人干吗要掺和这件事情。不瞒您说，我真的还有其他事情要办。”说到这里，歇洛克·福尔摩斯回过头去，继续整理他那本硕大的剪贴簿，为他新近收集的各种材料编制索引。","“WELL, Mrs. Warren, I cannot see that you have any particular cause for uneasiness, nor do I understand why I, whose time is of some value, should interfere in the matter. I really have other things to engage me.” So spoke Sherlock Holmes and turned back to the great scrapbook in which he was arranging and indexing some of his recent material."
"不过，这位女房东不光是性子执拗，而且不欠缺女性特有的巧妙手腕。她顽强地坚守着自己的阵地。","But the landlady had the pertinacity and also the cunning of her sex. She held her ground firmly."
"“去年的时候，您还帮我的一个房客办过事呢，”她说道——“我是说费尔戴尔·霍布斯先生。”","“You arranged an affair for a lodger of mine last year,” she said—“Mr. Fairdale Hobbs.”"
"“是的，没错——小事而已。”","“Ah, yes—a simple matter.”"
"“可他总把那件事情挂在嘴上——说您的心肠多么多么的好，先生，又说您扫清迷雾的本领多么多么的高超。所以啊，等到我自个儿陷进迷雾的时候，我就想起了他的话。我知道您肯定有办法帮我，只要您愿意就成。”","“But he would never cease talking of it—your kindness, sir, and the way in which you brought light into the darkness. I remembered his words when I was in doubt and darkness myself. I know you could if you only would.”"
"福尔摩斯架不住恭维，还有呢，替他说句公道话，也架不住别人劝他行善的恳求。两种力量合在一起，他无可奈何地叹了一声，放下手里的胶水刷子，把自个儿的椅子往后挪了挪。","Holmes was accessible upon the side of flattery, and also, to do him justice, upon the side of kindliness. The two forces made him lay down his gum-brush with a sigh of resignation and push back his chair."
"“好啦，好啦，沃伦太太，把您的事情说来听听吧。按我看，您应该不反对我抽烟吧？麻烦你，华生——火柴！我没理解错的话，您之所以担心，是因为您的新房客一直待在自己的房间里，您看不见他。咳，上帝保佑您，沃伦太太，您那个房客要是跟我一样的话，一连几个星期不露面也是常事。”","“Well, well, Mrs. Warren, let us hear about it then. You don’t object to tobacco, I take it? Thank you, Watson—the matches! You are uneasy, as I understand, because your new lodger remains in his rooms and you cannot see him. Why, bless you, Mrs. Warren, if I were your lodger you often would not see me for weeks on end.”"
"“那是当然，先生，不过，这一回的情形可不一样。这事情把我吓得够戗，福尔摩斯先生，吓得我夜里睡不着觉。我光是听见他在房里急急忙忙地走来走去，从清早走到深夜，但却连他的影子也瞧不见——这样的情形真让我受不了。我丈夫跟我一样，也被这件事情弄得非常紧张，可他白天好歹要去外面上班，我却得一刻不停地遭受折磨。他到底在躲什么？他干过些什么事情？除了那个帮忙的小姑娘之外，整座屋子里就只有他跟我，这样的情形真让我吃不消啦。”","“No doubt, sir, but this is different. It frightens me, Mr. Holmes. i can’t sleep for fright. To hear his quick step moving here and moving there from early morning to late at night, and yet never to catch so much as a glimpse of him—it’s more than i can stand. My husband is as nervous over it as i am, but he is out at his work all day, while i get no rest from it. What is he hiding for? What has he done? Except for the girl, i am all alone in the house with him, and it’s more than my nerves can stand.”"
"福尔摩斯探身向前，把瘦长的手指搭在了这个女人的肩头。只要他想，他总是能够施放几近催眠的安抚力量。这么着，女人眼里的惊恐神色渐渐消失，紧张的面容也放松下来，恢复了素日里的平凡模样。紧接着，她在福尔摩斯指给她的那把椅子上坐了下来。","Holmes leaned forward and laid his long, thin fingers upon the woman’s shoulder. He had an almost hypnotic power of soothing when he wished. The scared look faded from her eyes, and her agitated features smoothed into their usual commonplace. She sat down in the chair which he had indicated."
"“既然接下了这件事情，我就得知道所有的细节，”福尔摩斯说道，“您不用着急，想好了再说。最细小的事情兴许就是最关键的地方。您刚才说，这个人是十天之前来的，预付了两个星期的食宿费，对吗？”","“If i take it up i must understand every detail,” said he. “Take time to consider. The smallest point may be the most essential. You say that the man came ten days ago and paid you for a fortnight’s board and lodging?”"
"“他问我房钱怎么算，先生，于是我跟他说，每周五十先令，出租的是顶楼的一间卧房，带一个小小的起居室，所有东西都齐。”","“He asked my terms, sir. i said fifty shillings a week. There is a small sitting-room and bedroom, and all complete, at the top of the house.”"
"“然后呢？”","“Well?”"
"“他说，‘我可以给你每周五镑，可你得按我的规矩来办。’我是个穷苦女人，先生，沃伦先生挣得也很少，这笔租金对我来说很重要。紧接着，他掏出一张十镑的票子，当场递到了我的面前。‘只要你遵守我的规矩，接下来的很长一段时间里面，你每两个星期就能有这么一张，’他说，‘不行的话，咱们就不用打交道了。’”","“He said, ‘i’ll pay you five pounds a week if i can have it on my own terms.’ i’m a poor woman, sir, and Mr. Warren earns little, and the money meant much to me. He took out a ten pound note, and he held it out to me then and there. ‘You can have the same every fortnight for a long time to come if you keep the terms,’ he said. ‘if not, i’ll have no more to do with you.’”"
"“他的规矩是什么呢？”","“What were the terms?”"
"“呃，先生，规矩就是他要有屋子大门的钥匙，这倒是没什么，别的房客也经常这样。除此之外，他要求绝对的清静，我们不能在任何时候以任何理由去打搅他。”","“Well, sir, they were that he was to have a key of the house. That was all right. lodgers often have them. Also, that he was to be left entirely to himself and never, upon any excuse, to be disturbed.”"
"“这也没什么古怪啊，不是吗？”","“Nothing wonderful in that, surely?”"
"“按常理说，确实是没什么古怪，先生。只不过，接下来的事情完全不合常理。他已经在我们那儿住了十天，与此同时，不管是我、沃伦先生，还是那个小姑娘，都没有瞧见过他，一次都没有。光听见他急急忙忙地走来走去，走来走去，晚上走，早上走，中午也走。可是，除了第一天晚上之外，他从来没有离开过屋子。”","“Not in reason, sir. But this is out of all reason. He has been there for ten days, and neither Mr. Warren, nor i, nor the girl has once set eyes upon him. We can hear that quick step of his pacing up and down, up and down, night, morning, and noon; but except on that first night he has never once gone out of the house.”"
"“噢，第一天晚上他出去过，对吗？”","“Oh, he went out the first night, did he?”"
"“是的，先生，而且很晚才回来，回来的时候我们都已经睡了。租下房间之后，他跟我说了他要出去，还叫我不要闩上屋门。过了十二点，我才听见了他上楼的脚步声。”","“Yes, sir, and returned very late—after we were all in bed. He told me after he had taken the rooms that he would do so and asked me not to bar the door. i heard him come up the stair after midnight.”"
"“他怎么吃饭呢？”","“But his meals?”"
"“他特意交代过，听到他拉铃才能送饭，还得把饭摆在他门外的一把椅子上。吃完之后，他会把杯盘放在椅子上，拉铃叫我们去取。需要其他东西的时候，他会用印刷体写在纸片上，然后就把纸片放在门外。”","“It was his particular direction that we should always, when he rang, leave his meal upon a chair, outside his door. Then he rings again when he has finished, and we take it down from the same chair. if he wants anything else he prints it on a slip of paper and leaves it.”"
"“印刷体？”","“Prints it?”"
"“是的，先生，用铅笔写的印刷体。纸片上没有别的内容，只有物品的名称。喏，我带了一张来给您看——‘soap’（肥皂）。这又是一张——‘match’（火柴）。这儿还有一张，是他刚搬来的第一天早上放在门外的——‘ daily gazette’（《每日公报》）。每天早上，我都会把他要的那份报纸跟早餐一起送上去。”","“Yes, sir, prints it in pencil. Just the word, nothing more. Here’s one i brought to show you—Soap. Here’s another— match. This is one he left the first morning— daily gazEttE. i leave that paper with his breakfast every morning.”"
"“天哪，华生，”福尔摩斯说道，惊奇不已地盯着女房东递给他的那几张纸条，“这确实有点儿不同寻常。闭门谢客我还可以理解，可他干吗要用印刷体呢？印刷体写起来很费工夫啊。为什么不用手写体呢？这会是什么意思呢，华生？”","“Dear me, Watson,” said Holmes, staring with great curiosity at the slips of foolscap which the landlady had handed to him, “this is certainly a little unusual. Seclusion i can understand; but why print? Printing is a clumsy process. Why not write? What would it suggest, Watson?”"
"“意思就是他想隐藏自己的笔迹。 ”","“That he desired to conceal his handwriting.”"
"“可他干吗要隐藏呢？他的房东太太看到了他手写的一两个单词，对他又能有什么妨害呢？当然喽，没准儿你说得对。那么，还有一个问题，他干吗总是把条子写得这么简短呢？”","“But why? What can it matter to him that his landlady should have a word of his writing? Still, it may be as you say. Then, again, why such laconic messages?”"
"“我想不出来。 ”","“I cannot imagine.”"
"“这些纸片给咱们留下了充分的演绎空间。他用的是一支普通铅笔，笔芯很粗、色调发紫。你瞧，他把这张纸片的边缘部分撕掉了，而且是写完之后才撕的，所以把‘soap’（肥皂）当中的‘ S’撕掉了一部分。挺耐人寻味的吧，华生，你说呢？”","“It opens a pleasing field for intelligent speculation. The words are written with a broad-pointed, violet-tinted pencil of a not unusual pattern. You will observe that the paper is torn away at the side here after the printing was done, so that the ‘S’ of ‘Soap’ is partly gone. Suggestive, Watson, is it not?”"
"“是因为谨慎吗？”","“Of caution?”"
"“没错。显而易见，被他撕掉的部分沾上了指纹之类的痕迹，兴许会暴露他的身份[^2]。好了，沃伦太太，您刚才说这个人中等身材、肤色黝黑、蓄着大胡子。他大概是多大年纪呢？”","“Exactly. There was evidently some mark, some thumbprint, something which might give a clue to the person’s identity. now, Mrs. Warren, you say that the man was of middle size, dark, and bearded. What age would he be?”"
"“挺年轻的，先生——最多不过三十岁。”","“Youngish, sir—not over thirty.”"
"“好的，还有别的特征吗？”","“Well, can you give me no further indications?”"
"“他的英语说得很好，先生，不过，听他的口音，我觉得他是外国人。 ”","“He spoke good English, sir, and yet i thought he was a foreigner by his accent.”"
"“他穿得讲究吗？”","“And he was well dressed?”"
"“穿得非常讲究，先生，很有绅士派头。他穿一身黑衣服，没有什么异常的地方。”","“Very smartly dressed, sir—quite the gentleman. Dark clothes—nothing you would note.”"
"“他没说自己的名字吗？”","“He gave no name?”"
"“没有，先生。”","“No, sir.”"
"“他没有信件或者访客吗？”","“And has had no letters or callers?”"
"“没有。”","“None.”"
"“不过，早上的时候，您或者那个小姑娘肯定会替他收拾房间吧？”","“But surely you or the girl enter his room of a morning?”"
"“不是这样的，先生，他都是自己收拾。”","“No, sir; he looks after himself entirely.”"
"“天哪！这一点确实值得注意。他带了些什么行李呢？”","“Dear me! that is certainly remarkable. What about his luggage?”"
"“他带了个棕色的大包，别的就没了。”","“He had one big brown bag with him—nothing else.”"
"“呃，看样子，能供咱们参考的情况并不多嘛。您说他从来不往门外扔任何东西——一样都没有吗？”","“Well, we don’t seem to have much material to help us. Do you say nothing has come out of that room—absolutely nothing?”"
"女房东从自己的手提包里掏出一个信封，抖了一抖，两根烧过的火柴和一个烟头掉在了桌子上。","The landlady drew an envelope from her bag, from it she shook out two burnt matches and a cigarette-end upon the table."
"“这些都是他今天早上放在盘子里的东西。我带着它们来，是因为我听人说，您可以通过细小的东西看出重要的事情。”","“They were on his tray this morning. I brought them because I had heard that you can read great things out of small ones.”"
"福尔摩斯耸了耸肩。","Holmes shrugged his shoulders."
"“这上面没什么可看的，”他说道，“当然喽，他用火柴显然是为了点香烟，因为烧过的部分非常短，如果是点烟斗或者雪茄的话，火柴一定得烧掉一半。不过，天哪！这个烟头确实值得注意。您刚才说这位先生是个大胡子，而且蓄着髭须，对吧？”","“There is nothing here,” said he. “The matches have, of course, been used to light cigarettes. That is obvious from the shortness of the burnt end. Half the match is consumed in lighting a pipe or cigar. But dear me! this cigarette stub is certainly remarkable. The gentleman was bearded and moustached, you say?”"
"“是的，先生。”","“Yes, sir.”"
"“那我就想不明白了。依我看，只有脸刮得非常干净的人才能把烟抽成这样。不是吗，华生，尽管你的髭须并不是特别地浓密，可你要是把烟抽成这样的话，髭须肯定会被烤焦的。”","“I don’t understand that. i should say that only a clean-shaven man could have smoked this. Why, Watson, even your modest moustache would have been singed.”"
"“他用了烟嘴吧？”我如是推测。","“A holder?” i suggested."
"“不，不对，因为烟头的顶端已经被含得变了形。要我说，您那个房间里该不会住了两个人吧，沃伦太太？”","“No, no; the end is matted. i suppose there could not be two people in your rooms, Mrs. Warren?”"
"“不会的，先生。他吃得非常少，我经常都担心那点儿东西不够养活一个人哩。”","“No, sir. He eats so little that i often wonder it can keep life in one.”"
"“好吧，按我看，咱们只能等一等，等资料充足一点儿的时候再说。不管怎么样，您并没有什么抱怨的理由，因为您收到了应得的租金，而他也没有给您添什么麻烦，尽管他确实是个不同寻常的房客。他付给您的租金相当丰厚，如果他打定主意要躲起来不露面的话，跟您也没有直接的关系。我们无权干涉他的隐私，除非我们有理由认为，他这种隐秘生活是为了掩盖罪恶。我既然接下了这件事情，自然会时刻保持关注。有什么新情况的话，您一定要随时通知我，我保证会向您提供必要的帮助。”","“Well, i think we must wait for a little more material. After all, you have nothing to complain of. You have received your rent and he is not a troublesome lodger, though he is certainly an unusual one. He pays you well, and if he chooses to lie concealed it is no direct business of yours. We have no excuse for an intrusion upon his privacy until we have some reason to think that there is a guilty reason for it. i’ve taken up the matter, and i won’t lose sight of it. Report to me if anything fresh occurs, and rely upon my assistance if it should be needed.”"
"“毫无疑问，华生，这件案子包含着一些很有意思的细节，”女房东离开之后，福尔摩斯如是说道。“当然喽，这件事情兴许无足轻重，仅仅是个人的怪癖而已。如其不然，情况就有可能比表面上的样子严重得多。面对这样的事情，你首先就会想到一种显而易见的解释，也就是说，眼下住在那个房间里的人多半不是当初来租房的那个人，而且跟那个人很不一样。”","“There are certainly some points of interest in this case, Watson,” he remarked when the landlady had left us. “it may, of course, be trivial—individual eccentricity; or it may be very much deeper than appears on the surface. The first thing that strikes one is the obvious possibility that the person now in the rooms may be entirely different from the one who engaged them.”"
"“你为什么会这么想呢？”","“Why should you think so?”"
"“呃，抛开烟头的事情不说，房客仅有的一次外出恰好是在租下房间的当天晚上，这一点难道不值得推敲吗？他回来的时候，或者说是某个人回来的时候，所有能够充当见证的人都不在现场。咱们没有证据，没法断定回来的人就是当初出去的那个人。还有啊，租房的人英语说得很好，住在里面的人却把‘ matches’写成了‘match’。据我看，这个词他多半是从字典里查来的，字典里有这个词，但却没有这个词的复数形式[^3]。条子写得这么简短，正是为了掩盖他不懂英文的事实。没错，华生，咱们有充分的理由推测，房客已经掉了包。”","“Well, apart from this cigarette-end, was it not suggestive that the only time the lodger went out was immediately after his taking the rooms? He came back—or someone came back—when all witnesses were out of the way. We have no proof that the person who came back was the person who went out. Then, again, the man who took the rooms spoke English well. This other, however, prints ‘match’ when it should have been ‘matches.’ i can imagine that the word was taken out of a dictionary, which would give the noun but not the plural. The laconic style may be to conceal the absence of knowledge of English. Yes, Watson, there are good reasons to suspect that there has been a substitution of lodgers.”"
"“可是，掉包的目的在哪里呢？”","“But for what possible end?”"
"“哈！这正是咱们必须解决的问题。要解决这个问题，咱们有一条相当明显的线索。”说到这里，他把架子上的一个大本子拿了下来。他每天都会对伦敦各家报纸刊载的私人启事进行整理，整理的成果就在那个本子里面。“我的天！”他一边翻阅那个本子，一边感叹，“这真是一部呻吟、哭号与哀鸣交织而成的大合唱！真是一盘无奇不有的大杂烩！不过，对于研究奇特事件的学者来说，它无疑是古往今来最为难得的狩猎场！这个人独居一室，又想保持绝对的隐秘状态，因此就不能接收信件。既然如此，外面的人怎么才能把消息或者音信传递给他呢？显然得通过报上的启事，别的方法似乎都行不通。幸运的是，需要咱们研究的报纸只有一份。找到了，这就是从前面两周的《每日公报》上摘来的启事。‘一位围着黑色毛皮披肩的女士在王子溜冰俱乐部’——这个不用咱们来管。‘吉米肯定不会让他的妈妈伤心的’——好像跟咱们不相干。‘如果那位晕倒在布里克斯顿公共马车上的女士’——我对她不感兴趣。‘我的心天天都在盼望——’矫情啊，华生——矫情得无可救药！哈，这一则还有点儿像。你听听：‘请耐心等待。必将找到可靠通讯方式。目前请继续留意此专栏。G.’这则启事见报的时间是沃伦太太的房客入住两天之后。听起来挺像那么回事的，对吧？看样子，这个神秘人物虽然不会写英文，阅读还是没问题的。咱们接着往下看，看看能不能再次找到他们的蛛丝马迹。有了，这儿又有一则——时间是三天之后。‘正在进行妥善安排。请保持耐心，谨慎行事。乌云终将消散。G.’这之后，连着一个星期都没有新的，再下来就是一条格外明确的讯息：‘道路即将扫清。如有机会将发信号，届时请记住我们约定的暗号——一次代表A，两次代表 B，以此类推。很快就会与你联系。G.’这则启事登在昨天的报纸上，今天的报纸上什么也没有[^4]。这些启事都跟沃伦太太那个房客的情况非常吻合。咱们只需要稍微等一等，华生，情况肯定会变得更加清楚的。”","“Ah! there lies our problem. There is one rather obvious line of investigation.” He took down the great book in which, day by day, he filed the agony columns of the various london journals. “Dear me!” said he, turning over the pages, “what a chorus of groans, cries, and bleatings! What a rag-bag of singular happenings! But surely the most valuable hunting-ground that ever was given to a student of the unusual! This person is alone and cannot be approached by letter without a breach of that absolute secrecy which is desired. How is any news or any message to reach him from without? obviously by advertisement through a news paper. There seems no other way, and fortunately we need concern ourselves with the one paper only. Here are the *Daily Gazette* extracts of the last fortnight. ‘lady with a black boa at Prince’s Skating Club’—that we may pass. ‘Surely Jimmy will not break his mother’s heart’—that appears to be irrelevant. ‘if the lady who fainted in the Brixton bus’—she does not interest me. ‘Every day my heart longs——’ Bleat, Watson—unmitigated bleat! Ah, this is a little more possible. listen to this: ‘Be patient. Will find some sure means of communication. Meanwhile, this column. G.’ That is two days after Mrs. Warren’s lodger arrived. it sounds plausible, does it not? The mysterious one could understand English, even if he could not print it. let us see if we can pick up the trace again. Yes, here we are—three days later. ‘ Am making successful arrangements. Patience and prudence. The clouds will pass. G.’ nothing for a week after that. Then comes something much more definite: ‘The path is clearing. if i find chance signal message remember code agreed—one A, two B, and so on. You will hear soon. G.’ That was in yesterday’s paper, and there is nothing in to-day’s. it’s all very appropriate to Mrs. Warren’s lodger. if we wait a little, Watson, i don’t doubt that the affair will grow more intelligible.”"
"事实果然如此。第二天早晨，我发现我朋友站在壁炉跟前的小地毯上，背对炉火，脸上带着再满意不过的微笑。","So it proved; for in the morning i found my friend standing on the hearthrug with his back to the fire and a smile of complete satisfaction upon his face."
"“你觉得这一则怎么样，华生？”他高声说道，把桌上的报纸拿了起来。“‘红色高楼，白石贴面。四楼。左数第二扇窗子。天黑之后。G.’这已经说得非常明确了。依我看，吃过早饭之后，咱们得在沃伦太太的房子周围稍微侦察一下。啊，沃伦太太！今天早上的消息又是什么呢？”","“How’s this, Watson?” he cried, picking up the paper from the table. “‘High red house with white stone facings. Third floor. Second window left. After dusk. G.’ That is definite enough. i think after breakfast we must make a little reconnaissance of Mrs. Warren’s neighbourhood. Ah, Mrs. Warren! what news do you bring us this morning?”"
"我们的主顾已经突然冲进了房间，瞧她那副火急火燎的模样，肯定是出了什么不得了的事情。","our client had suddenly burst into the room with an explosive energy which told of some new and momentous development."
"“得让警察来管管啦，福尔摩斯先生，”她嚷嚷了一句。“我再也忍不下去了，一定得让他卷铺盖走人。我本打算直接冲上楼去打发他走，可我又觉得，应该先听听您的意见，要不就对不住您。反正啊，我的耐性已经到了尽头，更何况，老头子还挨了打——”","“It’s a police matter, Mr. Holmes,” she cried. “i’ll have no more of it. He shall pack out of there with his baggage. i would have gone straight up and told him so, only i thought it was but fair to you to take your opinion first. But i’m at the end of my patience, and when it comes to knocking my old man about——”"
"“沃伦先生挨了打？”","“Knocking Mr. Warren about?”"
"“起码是遭到了粗暴的对待吧。”","“Using him roughly, anyway.”"
"“可是，到底是谁对他动了粗呢？”","“But who used him roughly?”"
"“唉！我们要问的就是这个问题！事情出在今天早晨，先生。沃伦先生是莫顿-维莱特商行的考勤员，商行在托特纳姆宫廷路上，他七点之前就得出门上班。今天早上呢，他在路上刚走没几步，两个男的就从背后赶上去，用一件大衣罩住他的脑袋，把他塞进了路边的一辆马车。他们载着他兜了一个钟头，最后才打开车门把他推了出去。他躺在大路上，骇得晕头转向，完全没留意马车的去向。爬起来之后，他发现自己是在汉普斯特德荒地，于是就搭公共马车回了家。眼下他正在沙发上躺着呢，而我赶紧跑了过来，好把这件事情告诉您。”","“Ah! that’s what we want to know! it was this morning, sir. Mr. Warren is a timekeeper at Morton and Waylight’s, in Tottenham Court Road. He has to be out of the house before seven. Well, this morning he had not gone ten paces down the road when two men came up behind him, threw a coat over his head, and bundled him into a cab that was beside the curb. They drove him an hour, and then opened the door and shot him out. He lay in the roadway so shaken in his wits that he never saw what became of the cab. When he picked himself up he found he was on Hampstead Heath; so he took a bus home, and there he lies now on the sofa, while i came straight round to tell you what had happened.”"
"“真有意思，”福尔摩斯说道，“他有没有留意到那些人的长相——有没有听到他们说话呢？”","“Most interesting,” said Holmes. “Did he observe the appearance of these men—did he hear them talk?”"
"“没有，他完全吓糊涂了。他只记得自己被人塞进马车，后来又被人推下马车，从头到尾都跟变戏法一样。马车里至少有两个人，也可能是三个。 ”","“No; he is clean dazed. He just knows that he was lifted up as if by magic and dropped as if by magic. Two at least were in it, and maybe three.”"
"“按你们的看法，这一次的袭击跟你们的房客有关，对吗？”","“And you connect this attack with your lodger?”"
"“怎么说呢，我们在那里住了十五年，从来都没遇上过这样的事情。我已经受够他啦。钱可不能代表一切。不等今天天黑，我就要把他赶出我的房子。”","“Well, we’ve lived there fifteen years and no such happenings ever came before. i’ve had enough of him. Money’s not everything. i’ll have him out of my house before the day is done.”"
"“先等一等，沃伦太太，什么事情都不能着急。眼下我渐渐觉得，这件事情可能比乍看起来严重得多。事情已经非常清楚，您的房客面临着某种危险。同样清楚的是，他的那些敌人埋伏在您家门口，本来是为了对付他，结果却在雾蒙蒙的晨光之中把您的丈夫认成了他。发现自己认错了人，他们就把您的丈夫给放了。要是没认错的话，天知道他们会干出些什么来呢。”","“Wait a bit, Mrs. Warren. Do nothing rash. i begin to think that this affair may be very much more important than appeared at first sight. it is clear now that some danger is threatening your lodger. it is equally clear that his enemies, lying in wait for him near your door, mistook your husband for him in the foggy morning light. on discovering their mistake they released him. What they would have done had it not been a mistake, we can only conjecture.”"
"“那么，我应该怎么做呢，福尔摩斯先生？”","“Well, what am i to do, Mr. Holmes?”"
"“我特别想见见您这位房客，沃伦太太。”","“I have a great fancy to see this lodger of yours, Mrs. Warren.”"
"“我看您没法见到他，除非您破门而入，因为他成天都锁着门。放好盘子往楼下走的时候，我总是能听见他开锁的声音。”","“I don’t see how that is to be managed, unless you break in the door. i always hear him unlock it as i go down the stair after i leave the tray.”"
"“他总得把盘子拿进去吧，我们肯定可以躲在某个地方，趁他拿盘子的时候看看他。”","“He has to take the tray in. Surely we could conceal ourselves and see him do it.”"
"女房东想了想。","The landlady thought for a moment."
"“是这样，先生，他的房间正对着储藏室。兴许我可以摆上一面镜子，如果您躲在储藏室的门后面的话——”","“Well, sir, there’s the box-room opposite. i could arrange a looking-glass, maybe, and if you were behind the door——”"
"“好极了！”福尔摩斯说道，“他什么时候吃午饭呢？”","“Excellent!” said Holmes. “When does he lunch?”"
"“大概一点钟，先生。”","“About one, sir.”"
"“好的，我和华生医生肯定会准时赶到。那么，沃伦太太，再见吧。 ”","“Then Dr. Watson and i will come round in time. For the present, Mrs. Warren, good-bye.”"
"十二点半，我俩已经来到了沃伦太太的家门口。沃伦太太的房子是一座又高又窄的黄色砖房，所在的大奥姆街是大英博物馆东北边的一条狭窄通衢。房子贴近街角，从这里可以看到屋宇更为气派的豪街[^5]。豪街上有一排十分显眼的住宅，福尔摩斯指了指其中的一座，吃吃地笑了起来。","At half-past twelve we found ourselves upon the steps of Mrs. Warren’s house—a high, thin, yellow-brick edifice in Great orme Street, a narrow thoroughfare at the northeast side of the British Museum. Standing as it does near the corner of the street, it commands a view down Howe Street, with its more pretentious houses. Holmes pointed with a chuckle to one of these, a row of residential flats, which projected so that they could not fail to catch the eye."
"“瞧，华生！”他说道， “‘红色高楼，石头贴面。’他们的信号台就在那里，错不了。咱们知道他们发信号的地方，又知道他们的暗号，由此看来，这一次的任务肯定是轻而易举。那扇窗子上贴着‘出租’的告示，显然是一套空着的公寓，正好给他的同伙提供了方便。好了，沃伦太太，情况怎么样呢？”","“See, Watson!” said he. “ ‘High red house with stone facings.’ There is the signal station all right. We know the place, and we know the code; so surely our task should be simple. There’s a ‘to let’ card in that window. it is evidently an empty flat to which the confederate has access. Well, Mrs. Warren, what now?”"
"“我都替你们安排好了。你们俩上来吧，把靴子脱在楼梯转角的平台上，我这就领你们去。”","“I have it all ready for you. if you will both come up and leave your boots below on the landing, i’ll put you there now.”"
"沃伦太太替我俩安排了一个绝佳的藏身之处，镜子也摆得非常巧妙，这样一来，我俩坐在暗处就可以清清楚楚地看到对面的房门。我俩刚刚安顿好，沃伦太太就离开了，这时远远的地方传来了叮叮当当的声响，说明那个神秘的房客已经拉响了铃铛。不一会儿，女房东端着盘子再次现身，把盘子放在那道紧闭房门旁边的一把椅子上，然后就踏着重重的步子再次离开。我俩蜷缩在门背后的角落里，眼睛紧紧地盯着镜子。女房东的脚步声渐渐消失，突然之间，我俩的耳边传来了钥匙转动门锁的咔嗒声响，门把转了一转，两只纤瘦的手猛然伸到门外，把椅子上的盘子端了起来。一眨眼的工夫，那双手已经急匆匆地缩了回去，而我瞬间瞥见了一张肤色黝黑的美丽脸庞，正在惊恐万状地看着房门略微敞开的储藏室、看着那道窄窄的门缝。紧接着，对面的房门重重地关了起来，钥匙再次转动，一切归于沉寂。这时候，福尔摩斯拽了拽我的衣袖，我俩轻手轻脚地下了楼。","It was an excellent hiding-place which she had arranged. The mirror was so placed that, seated in the dark, we could very plainly see the door opposite. We had hardly settled down in it, and Mrs. Warren left us, when a distant tinkle announced that our mysterious neighbour had rung. Presently the landlady appeared with the tray, laid it down upon a chair beside the closed door, and then, treading heavily, departed. Crouching together in the angle of the door, we kept our eyes fixed upon the mirror. Suddenly, as the landlady’s footsteps died away, there was the creak of a turning key, the handle revolved, and two thin hands darted out and lifted the tray from the chair. An instant later it was hurriedly replaced, and i caught a glimpse of a dark, beautiful, horrified face glaring at the narrow opening of the box-room. Then the door crashed to, the key turned once more, and all was silence. Holmes twitched my sleeve, and together we stole down the stair."
"“晚上我还会来，”他对满怀期望的女房东说了一句。“依我看，华生，这件事情嘛，咱们还是回家商量比较好。”","“I will call again in the evening,” said he to the expectant landlady. “i think, Watson, we can discuss this business better in our own quarters.”"
"“刚才你已经看见了，事实正如我的预料，”说这话的时候，他已经窝进了他那把安乐椅。“房客已经掉了包。可我没有料到，华生，咱们看到的竟然是个女人，还是个不一般的女人。”","“My surmise, as you saw, proved to be correct,” said he, speaking from the depths of his easy-chair. “There has been a substitution of lodgers. What i did not foresee is that we should find a woman, and no ordinary woman, Watson.”"
"“她肯定是看见咱们了。”","“She saw us.”"
"“应该这么说，她看见了某种值得警惕的情况。这一点可以肯定。整件事情的大致脉络已经是相当清晰了，对吧？一对爱侣跑到伦敦来逃难，为的是躲避某种迫在眉睫的可怕威胁。这种威胁有多可怕，瞧瞧他们有多小心就知道了。男的有一些不得不办的事情，因此就想把女的安置在一个绝对安全的地方，自己好去办事。要做到这一点并不容易，可他想出了一个别出心裁的办法，效果也非常之好，连房东都不知道那个女的住在自己家里，尽管她还得给那个女的供应伙食。现在看来，那个女的之所以要用印刷体写条子，显然是害怕别人通过笔迹看出自己的性别。那个男的不敢接近女的，怕的是把敌人引到她的身边。他没法直接跟她联系，所以就用上了报纸的私人启事栏。到这里为止，所有的事情都可以说是一目了然。”","“Well, she saw something to alarm her. That is certain. The general sequence of events is pretty clear, is it not? A couple seek refuge in london from a very terrible and instant danger. The measure of that danger is the rigour of their precautions. The man, who has some work which he must do, desires to leave the woman in absolute safety while he does it. it is not an easy problem, but he solved it in an original fashion, and so effectively that her presence was not even known to the landlady who supplies her with food. The printed messages, as is now evident, were to prevent her sex being discovered by her writing. The man cannot come near the woman, or he will guide their enemies to her. Since he cannot communicate with her direct, he has recourse to the agony column of a paper. So far all is clear.”"
"“可是，这件事情的根由是什么呢？”","“But what is at the root of it?”"
"“噢，可不是嘛，华生——你的问题可真是务实，跟往常一样！这一切的根由是什么呢？这个问题起初只是沃伦太太的大惊小怪，但却在咱们调查的过程当中渐渐放大，呈现出了一种更为险恶的面目。最低限度，咱们也可以这么说：这绝对不是普普通通的私奔事件。你自己也看见了，发现危险征兆的时候，那个女的是一种什么样的表情。不仅如此，咱们还听到了房东先生遭到袭击的事情，那次袭击的真正目标无疑是那个房客。这些危险讯号，还有那对男女竭力隐瞒身份的举动，全都意味着这是件生死攸关的事情。此外，针对沃伦先生的袭击还可以说明，不管那对男女的敌人究竟是何方神圣，总而言之，他们并不知道房客已经从男的换成了女的。华生啊，这可是一件非常离奇、非常复杂的事情哩。”","“Ah, yes, Watson—severely practical, as usual! What is at the root of it all? Mrs. Warren’s whimsical problem enlarges somewhat and assumes a more sinister aspect as we proceed. This much we can say: that it is no ordinary love escapade. You saw the woman’s face at the sign of danger. We have heard, too, of the attack upon the landlord, which was undoubtedly meant for the lodger. These alarms, and the desperate need for secrecy, argue that the matter is one of life or death. The attack upon Mr. Warren further shows that the enemy, whoever they are, are themselves not aware of the substitution of the female lodger for the male. it is very curious and complex, Watson.”"
"“那你干吗要接着往下查呢？查下去对你有什么好处呢？”","“Why should you go further in it? What have you to gain from it?”"
"“真是啊，有什么好处呢？这就叫‘为艺术而艺术’，华生。依我看，行医的时候，你也是光想病例不想诊费吧？”","“What, indeed? it is art for art’s sake, Watson. i suppose when you doctored you found yourself studying cases without thought of a fee?”"
"“我那是为了长学问啊，福尔摩斯。”","“For my education, Holmes.”"
"“学问是没有止境的，华生。学问是一堂又一堂的课程，最精彩的课程总在最后。这是件富于教益的案子，虽然说无名无利，可你还是想把它弄个水落石出。天黑的时候，咱们的调查就会有新的进展。”","“Education never ends, Watson. it is a series of lessons with the greatest for the last. This is an instructive case. There is neither money nor credit in it, and yet one would wish to tidy it up. When dusk comes we should find ourselves one stage advanced in our investigation.”"
"我俩回到沃伦太太家里的时候，伦敦冬日的暮色已经凝成了一道灰色的帘幕，全无变化的色彩笼罩一切，打破单调的只有一扇扇黄光闪耀、轮廓清晰的方形窗子，以及煤气路灯泛出的一团团模糊光晕。我俩从寄宿公寓里那间光线昏暗的起居室向外张望，朦胧暮色之中，又一点暗淡的灯火在高高的地方亮了起来。","When we returned to Mrs. Warren’s rooms, the gloom of a london winter evening had thickened into one gray curtain, a dead monotone of colour, broken only by the sharp yellow squares of the windows and the blurred haloes of the gas-lamps. As we peered from the darkened sitting-room of the lodging-house, one more dim light glimmered high up through the obscurity."
"“有人在那间屋子里走动，”福尔摩斯低声说道，瘦削的脸庞急切地凑到了窗子玻璃跟前。“没错，我看见他的影子啦。他又出现了！他手里拿着一支蜡烛，眼下正在朝咱们这边张望，肯定是想确定她正在朝他那边看。好了，他开始晃蜡烛了。你也留意一下他发的信号吧，华生，咱们可以互相核对。他晃了一下——这就代表‘A’，错不了。很好，接着来。这一次你数出来多少下呢？二十。跟我数的一样。这就代表‘T’，连起来是‘ at’，意思很清楚嘛！又一个‘T’，毫无疑问，这是第二个单词的开头。好的，继续——‘TENTA’。他彻底停住了。该不会就这么完了吧，华生？‘ATTENTA’这串字母没有意义啊，就算把它拆成‘ AT’、‘TEN’和‘TA’这三个部分，还是没有什么意义，除非‘TA’是某个人的姓名缩写。信号又来了！这一回是什么呢？‘ATTE’——怎么回事，这一次的讯息跟上一次一模一样啊。怪事，华生，咄咄怪事！他又停住啦！‘AT’——瞧这意思，他还要重复第三次哩。接连三次都是‘ATTENTA’！他到底要重复多少次呢？不对，他好像是不打算再重复了，因为他已经离开了窗口。你觉得这是什么意思呢，华生？”","“Someone is moving in that room,” said Holmes in a whisper, his gaunt and eager face thrust forward to the window-pane. “Yes, i can see his shadow. There he is again! He has a candle in his hand. now he is peering across. He wants to be sure that she is on the lookout. now he begins to flash. Take the message also, Watson, that we may check each other. A single flash—that is A, surely. now, then. How many did you make it? Twenty. So did i. That should mean T. AT—that’s intelligible enough! Another T. Surely this is the beginning of a second word. now, then—TENTA. Dead stop. That can’t be all, Watson? ATTENTA gives no sense. nor is it any better as three words AT, TEN, TA, unless T. A. are a person’s initials. There it goes again! What’s that? ATTE—why, it is the same message over again. Curious, Watson, very curious! now he is off once more! AT—why, he is repeating it for the third time. ATTENTA three times! How often will be repeat it? no, that seems to be the finish. He has withdrawn from the window. What do you make of it, Watson?”"
"“应该是一条密码讯息吧，福尔摩斯。”","“A cipher message, Holmes.”"
"我同伴突然心领神会，吃吃地笑了一声。“而且是一种不太难懂的密码，华生，”他说道，“咳，当然喽，他用的是意大利文！结尾的‘A’是因为他说话的对象是个女人。如此说来，他的意思就是‘当心！当心！当心！’ [^6]你觉得怎么样，华生？”","My companion gave a sudden chuckle of comprehension. “And not a very obscure cipher, Watson,” said he. “Why, of course, it is italian! The a means that it is addressed to a woman. ‘Beware! Beware! Beware!’ How’s that, Watson?”"
"“我觉得你说得对。”","“I believe you have hit it.”"
"“绝对错不了。这是条十万火急的讯息，更何况还重复了三次。不过，他要她当心什么呢？等等啊，他又到窗子边上来了。”","“Not a doubt of it. it is a very urgent message, thrice repeated to make it more so. But beware of what? Wait a bit; he is coming to the window once more.”"
"我俩又一次看到那个男人伏在窗边的黢黑身影，又一次看到那个小小的火苗在窗子里来回摇晃，代表着新的信号。火苗摇晃的速度比之前快了一些，快得几乎让人数不过来。","Again we saw the dim silhouette of a crouching man and the whisk of the small flame across the window as the signals were renewed. They came more rapidly than before—so rapid that it was hard to follow them."
"“‘PERICOLO’——‘pericolo’[^7]——呃，这是什么意思呢，华生？‘危险’，对吗？没错，老天作证，这个信号的意思是‘危险’。他又开始了！‘PERI’。嘿，到底是怎么——”","“PERICOLO—*pericolo*—eh, what’s that, Watson? ‘Danger,’ isn’t it? Yes, by Jove, it’s a danger signal. There he goes again! pEri. Halloa, what on earth——”"
"烛光已经突然熄灭，微微发亮的方形窗口不见了，那座高耸建筑的四楼也变成了一条黑黢黢的带子，夹在那些灯光明亮的楼层之间。最后这句示警的呼叫陡然中断，究竟是怎么中断的，又是被谁打断的呢？我俩的脑子里立刻闪出了同样的疑问。福尔摩斯原本伏在窗边，此时便一跃而起。","The light had suddenly gone out, the glimmering square of window had disappeared, and the third floor formed a dark band round the lofty building, with its tiers of shining casements. That last warning cry had been suddenly cut short. How, and by whom? The same thought occurred on the instant to us both. Holmes sprang up from where he crouched by the window."
"“这可就严重了，华生，”他高声说道，“一定是发生了什么十分凶险的事情！这样的讯息怎么会以这样的方式中断呢？我得向苏格兰场通报这件事情——可是，眼前的形势实在是太过危急，容不得咱们离开。”","“This is serious, Watson,” he cried. “There is some devilry going forward! Why should such a message stop in such a way? i should put Scotland Yard in touch with this business—and yet, it is too pressing for us to leave.”"
"“需要我去报警吗？”","“Shall I go for the police?”"
"“咱们应该先把情况摸得更清楚一点儿才是。说不定，事情的真相也没有那么凶险。走吧，华生，咱们这就赶过去，亲眼看看到底是怎么回事。”","“We must define the situation a little more clearly. it may bear some more innocent interpretation. Come, Watson, let us go across ourselves and see what we can make of it.”"
"我俩飞快地顺着豪街往前赶，我回头看了看我俩刚刚离开的那座房子。顶楼的窗子里隐约可以看见一个女人的头部剪影，她正在一瞬不瞬地凝望窗外的夜色，等待着中断的信号再次出现，心里装满了令人窒息的焦灼与疑虑。豪街那座公寓门口的栏杆上倚着一个男人，全身都被围巾和大衣包裹得严严实实。公寓门厅的灯光照到了我俩的脸上，那个男人一下子惊跳起来。","As we walked rapidly down Howe Street i glanced back at the building which we had left. There, dimly outlined at the top window, i could see the shadow of a head, a woman’s head, gazing tensely, rigidly, out into the night, waiting with breathless suspense for the renewal of that interrupted message. At the doorway of the Howe Street flats a man, muffled in a cravat and greatcoat, was leaning against the railing. He started as the hall-light fell upon our faces."
"“福尔摩斯！”他大叫一声。","“Holmes!” he cried."
"“是你啊，格雷森！”我同伴一边说，一边跟这名苏格兰场探员握起手来。“情人既已相见，旅路便是终点[^8]。什么风把你给吹来了呢？”","“Why, Gregson!” said my companion as he shook hands with the Scotland Yard detective. “Journeys end with lovers’ meetings. What brings you here?”"
"“依我看，就是把你吹来的那阵风，”格雷森说道，“可我想不出来，你是怎么赶上那阵风的。”","“The same reasons that bring you, i expect,” said Gregson. “How you got on to it i can’t imagine.”"
"“线头虽然不一样，连着的却是同一团乱麻。我这是在追踪那些信号。 ”","“Different threads, but leading up to the same tangle. i’ve been taking the signals.”"
"“信号？”","“Signals?”"
"“是啊，信号是从那扇窗子里发出来的。刚才它突然断了，所以我们才跑过来查找原因。不过，既然你们已经稳稳地控制住了局面，我看我没必要再往下查了。”","“Yes, from that window. They broke off in the middle. We came over to see the reason. But since it is safe in your hands i see no object in continuing the business.”"
"“等一等！”格雷森连忙叫道。“我得替你说句公道话，福尔摩斯先生，有你帮着我办案的时候，我总是会觉得信心百倍。这座公寓只有这么一个出口，咱们可以稳稳地逮到他。”","“Wait a bit!” cried Gregson eagerly. “i’ll do you this justice, Mr. Holmes, that i was never in a case yet that i didn’t feel stronger for having you on my side. There’s only the one exit to these flats, so we have him safe.”"
"“他是谁啊？”","“Who is he?”"
"“妙啊，妙啊，我们总算是赢了你一次，福尔摩斯先生。这一次，你不认输也不行了吧。”他用手杖重重地敲了敲地面，听到这个声音，一个车夫从街对面的一辆四轮马车旁边踱了过来，手里还拿着马鞭。“我来替你向歇洛克·福尔摩斯先生作个介绍，可以吧？”他冲车夫说道，“这位是莱弗顿先生，来自美国的平克顿侦探事务所[^9]。”","“Well, well, we score over you for once, Mr. Holmes. You must give us best this time.” He struck his stick sharply upon the ground, on which a cabman, his whip in his band, sauntered over from a four-wheeler which stood on the far side of the street. “May i introduce you to Mr. Sherlock Holmes?” he said to the cabman. “This is Mr. leverton, of Pinkerton’s American Agency.”"
"“长岛山洞谜案就是您破的吧？”福尔摩斯说道，“幸会，先生。”","“The hero of the long island cave mystery?” said Holmes. “Sir, i am pleased to meet you.”"
"这个美国人年纪轻轻，瘦削的脸庞刮得干干净净，看起来又沉静又精明。听了福尔摩斯的夸奖，他顿时满脸通红。“这一回我可是拼上了老命，福尔摩斯先生，”他说道，“要是能抓到戈尔吉亚诺——”","The American, a quiet, businesslike young man, with a clean-shaven, hatchet face, flushed up at the words of commendation. “i am on the trail of my life now, Mr. Holmes,” said he. “if i can get Gorgiano——”"
"“什么！您说的是红圈会的那个戈尔吉亚诺吗？”","“What! Gorgiano of the Red Circle?”"
"“嗬，他在欧洲也是个响当当的人物，对吗？这么说吧，我们美国那边的人对他可是一清二楚。我们知道他是五十起谋杀案的幕后主使，只可惜没有确凿的证据，没法把他抓起来。我从纽约追到了这里，又在伦敦跟了他一个星期，等待着一个抓他的名目。格雷森先生和我把他堵在了这座大公寓里面，公寓只有这么一道门，他肯定是溜不掉的。从他进去之后，一共有三个人从里面出来，我可以打包票，那三个人都不是他。”","“Oh, he has a European fame, has he? Well, we’ve learned all about him in America. We *know* he is at the bottom of fifty murders, and yet we have nothing positive we can take him on. i tracked him over from new York, and i’ve been close to him for a week in london, waiting some excuse to get my hand on his collar. Mr. Gregson and i ran him to ground in that big tenement house, and there’s only the one door, so he can’t slip us. There’s three folk come out since he went in, but i’ll swear he wasn’t one of them.”"
"“福尔摩斯先生刚才说到了信号的事情，”格雷森说道，“依我看，这次的情形又跟往常一样，他知道很多我们不知道的事情。”","“Mr. Holmes talks of signals,” said Gregson. “i expect, as usual, he knows a good deal that we don’t.”"
"福尔摩斯三言两语地讲明了我俩掌握的情况。","In a few clear words Holmes explained the situation as it had appeared to us."
"美国人两手一拍，显得很是气恼。","The American struck his hands together with vexation."
"“他发现咱们啦！”他大叫一声。","“He’s on to us!” he cried."
"“您为什么这么想呢？”","“Why do you think so?”"
"“咳，这不是明摆着的吗？他跑到这里来，开始给某个同伙发信号——他那个帮会在伦敦也有几个爪牙。然后呢，就像您刚才说的那样，他正在警告同伙有危险，突然之间却停了下来。由此看来，他还在窗口的时候，一定是突然瞥见了咱们在街上，或者是通过其他某种方式意识到危险迫在眉睫，自己必须立刻逃跑，他的举动只能是这个意思，要不然又是什么意思呢？您觉得咱们应该怎么办呢，福尔摩斯先生？”","“Well, it figures out that way, does it not? Here he is, sending out messages to an accomplice—there are several of his gang in london. Then suddenly, just as by your own account he was telling them that there was danger, he broke short off. What could it mean except that from the window he had suddenly either caught sight of us in the street, or in some way come to understand how close the danger was, and that he must act right away if he was to avoid it? What do you suggest, Mr. Holmes?”"
"“咱们应该立刻上楼，亲眼瞧瞧这是怎么回事。 ”","“That we go up at once and see for ourselves.”"
"“可是，咱们手里没有逮捕令啊。 ”","“But we have no warrant for his arrest.”"
"“他待在一间空屋子里，形迹又非常可疑，”格雷森说道，“暂时说来，咱们是有理由拘捕他的。把他逮起来之后，咱们可以问问纽约警方，看他们能不能提供一些继续关押他的理由。咱们现在就去逮捕他，有什么责任都由我来担着。”","“He is in unoccupied premises under suspicious circumstances,” said Gregson. “That is good enough for the moment. When we have him by the heels we can see if new York can’t help us to keep him. i’ll take the responsibility of arresting him now.”"
"需要智力的时候，我们的各位官方探员常常会出岔子，到了需要勇气的时候，他们却从来不会含糊。这不，格雷森一马当先地顺着楼梯往上爬，打算去逮捕那个杀人如麻的亡命凶徒，神态无比从容、无比干练，就跟他走的是苏格兰场的办公室楼梯似的。平克顿的侦探想要抢到格雷森的头里，格雷森却用胳膊肘毅然决然地把他挡在了身后。应对伦敦的危险，自然是伦敦警方的特权。","Our official detectives may blunder in the matter of intelligence, but never in that of courage. Gregson climbed the stair to arrest this desperate murderer with the same absolutely quiet and businesslike bearing with which he would have ascended the official staircase of Scotland Yard. The Pinkerton man had tried to push past him, but Gregson had firmly elbowed him back. london dangers were the privilege of the london force."
"到了四楼的楼梯口，我们发现左手边的那套公寓房门虚掩。格雷森推开房门，里面漆黑一片、鸦雀无声。我划燃一根火柴，点亮了格雷森的提灯。提灯的火苗突突地蹿成了火焰，这时候，我们都惊讶得倒吸了一口凉气。没铺地毯的松木地板上有两行带血的新鲜足迹，红色的脚印从一间关着门的内室延伸到了我们的面前。格雷森一把推开内室的门，把火光熊熊的提灯伸向自己的前方，我们都凑了过去，隔着他的肩膀急切地窥视房里的情形。","The door of the left-hand flat upon the third landing was standing ajar. Gregson pushed it open. Within all was absolute silence and darkness. I struck a match and lit the detective’s lantern. As i did so, and as the flicker steadied into a flame, we all gave a gasp of surprise. On the deal boards of the carpetless floor there was outlined a fresh track of blood. The red steps pointed towards us and led away from an inner room, the door of which was closed. Gregson flung it open and held his light full blaze in front of him, while we all peered eagerly over his shoulders."
"眼前这间空屋的中央蜷着一个五大三粗的男人，躺在白木地板上一个湿漉漉的大圆圈里面，光溜溜的黝黑脸庞拧成了怪异可怖的模样，脑袋周围是一摊怵目惊心的殷红血泊。他的双膝支棱着，摊开的双手诉说着巨大的痛苦，仰着的脖子又粗又黑，脖子中央戳着一把刀子，刀子整个儿地没入了他的身体，只有白色的刀柄还留在外面。这个人虽然身材魁梧，遭到如此恐怖的攻击之后，想必也是当场倒地，就像挨了斧子的公牛一样。他右手旁边的地板上有一把极其可怕的角柄双刃匕首，匕首附近还有一只黑色的小山羊皮手套。","In the middle of the floor of the empty room was huddled the figure of an enormous man, his clean-shaven, swarthy face grotesquely horrible in its contortion and his head encircled by a ghastly crimson halo of blood, lying in a broad wet circle upon the white woodwork. His knees were drawn up, his hands thrown out in agony, and from the centre of his broad, brown, upturned throat there projected the white haft of a knife driven blade-deep into his body. Giant as he was, the man must have gone down like a pole-axed ox before that terrific blow. Beside his right hand a most formidable horn-handled, two-edged dagger lay upon the floor, and near it a black kid glove."
"“我的天！这正是黑煞戈尔吉亚诺本人！”美国侦探叫道，“这一回，咱们可被别人抢了先啦。”","“By George! it’s Black Gorgiano himself!” cried the American detective. “Someone has got ahead of us this time.”"
"“这肯定就是出现在窗口的那支蜡烛，福尔摩斯先生，”格雷森说道，“嘿，你这是在干什么？”","“Here is the candle in the window, Mr. Holmes,” said Gregson. “Why, whatever are you doing?”"
"福尔摩斯已经走到窗边，点上了那支蜡烛，眼下正举着蜡烛，对着窗子玻璃来回地晃动。这之后，他冲着窗外的黑暗看了一阵，跟着就吹灭蜡烛，把它扔到了地板上。","Holmes had stepped across, had lit the candle, and was passing it backward and forward across the window-panes. Then he peered into the darkness, blew the candle out, and threw it on the floor."
"“我确实觉得，这对咱们大有帮助，”他这么说了一句，然后就走了过来，站在那里沉思默想，两名专业侦探则忙着检查尸体。“您刚才说，你们还在楼下等着的时候，一共有三个人走出这座公寓，”想了一阵之后，他终于开了口。“您仔细留意过他们的模样吗？”","“I rather think that will be helpful,” said he. He came over and stood in deep thought while the two professionals were examining the body. “You say that three people came out from the flat while you were waiting downstairs,” said he at last. “Did you observe them closely?”"
"“是的，我留意过。”","“Yes, i did.”"
"“其中有没有一个三十岁左右、黑胡子、黑皮肤、中等身材的家伙呢？”","“Was there a fellow about thirty, black-bearded, dark, of middle size?”"
"“有的，最后一个从我身边经过的就是这么一个家伙。”","“Yes; he was the last to pass me.”"
"“依我看，他就是你们要找的人。我可以把他的长相告诉你们，他的脚印咱们也看得清清楚楚。对你们来说，这应该够用了吧。”","“That is your man, i fancy. i can give you his description, and we have a very excellent outline of his footmark. That should be enough for you.”"
"“不太够，福尔摩斯先生，伦敦有几百万人呢。”","“Not much, Mr. Holmes, among the millions of london.”"
"“确实有可能不够，所以啊，刚才我就想，最好把这位女士请来帮你们的忙。”","“Perhaps not. That is why i thought it best to summon this lady to your aid.”"
"听了他的话，我们不约而同地转过身去。门口站着一个身材颀长的漂亮女人，正是布卢姆斯伯里街区[^10]那个神秘的房客。她慢慢地走上前来，苍白憔悴的脸庞带着忧心如焚的神情，圆睁的眼睛一瞬不瞬，惊骇的目光牢牢地锁住了地板上那个黑乎乎的人形。","We all turned round at the words. There, framed in the doorway, was a tall and beautiful woman—the mysterious lodger of Bloomsbury. Slowly she advanced, her face pale and drawn with a frightful apprehension, her eyes fixed and staring, her terrified gaze riveted upon the dark figure on the floor."
"“你们杀死了他！”她喃喃念道。“噢，我的天，你们杀死了他！”接下来，我听见她突然深吸一口气，欢呼一声，高高地跳了起来。她蹦蹦跳跳地在房间里转了一圈又一圈，不停地拍手，黑色的眼睛里闪着惊喜交集的光芒，一声又一声意大利语的轻轻呼喊从她嘴里连珠炮似的迸了出来。这样的一个女人竟然会为这样的一种景象欣喜若狂，实在让人骇异莫名。突然之间，她停了下来，直愣愣地盯着我们，眼睛里充满了迷惑。","“You have killed him!” she muttered. “oh, *Dio mio*, you have killed him!” Then i heard a sudden sharp intake of her breath, and she sprang into the air with a cry of joy. Round and round the room she danced, her hands clapping, her dark eyes gleaming with delighted wonder, and a thousand pretty italian exclamations pouring from her lips. it was terrible and amazing to see such a woman so convulsed with joy at such a sight. Suddenly she stopped and gazed at us all with a questioning stare."
"“你们！你们都是警察，对吧？你们杀死了朱塞佩·戈尔吉亚诺，对不对？”","“But you! You are police, are you not? You have killed Giuseppe Gorgiano. is it not so?”"
"“我们确实是警察，太太。”","“We are police, madam.”"
"她往房间四周的黑暗角落张望了一番。","She looked round into the shadows of the room."
"“可是，吉纳罗又在哪儿呢？”她问道。“我问的是我丈夫，吉纳罗·卢卡。我名叫埃米莉亚·卢卡，我俩都是从纽约来的。吉纳罗在哪儿呢？刚才他从这扇窗子叫我过来，所以我就用最快的速度赶来了。”","“But where, then, is Gennaro?” she asked. “He is my husband, Gennaro lucca. i am Emilia lucca, and we are both from new York. Where is Gennaro? He called me this moment from this window, and i ran with all my speed.”"
"“叫您过来的是我，”福尔摩斯说道。","“It was I who called,” said Holmes."
"“您！您怎么会知道用这种方法来叫我呢？”","“You! How could you call?”"
"“你们的暗号并不复杂，太太。我们需要您过来一趟，而我刚好知道，只需要用烛光打出‘ Vieni’[^11]这个词，您肯定会过来的。”","“Your cipher was not difficult, madam. Your presence here was desirable. i knew that i had only to flash ‘*Vieni*’ and you would surely come.”"
"这位漂亮的意大利女士敬畏地看了看我的同伴。","The beautiful italian looked with awe at my companion."
"“我想不出您是怎么知道这些事情的，”她说道，“朱塞佩·戈尔吉亚诺——他是怎么——”她顿了一顿，紧接着，她的脸上突然漾起了骄傲与喜悦的光彩。“我明白了！是我的吉纳罗！我的妙人儿吉纳罗，我的可人儿吉纳罗，是他保护我远离了所有的伤害，他办到了，他用他自个儿那双强壮的手杀死了这个畜生！噢，吉纳罗，你可真是了不起！什么样的女人才配得上你这样的男人呢？”","“I do not understand how you know these things,” she said. “Giuseppe Gorgiano—how did he——” She paused, and then suddenly her face lit up with pride and delight. “now i see it! My Gennaro! My splendid, beautiful Gennaro, who has guarded me safe from all harm, he did it, with his own strong hand he killed the monster! oh, Gennaro, how wonderful you are! What woman could ever be worthy of such a man?”"
"“呃，卢卡太太，”不解风情的格雷森一边说，一边抓住了这位女士的袖管，神态无比淡漠，就跟他抓的是个诺丁山[^12]痞子一样，“我还不清楚您到底是谁，干的又是什么行当，不过，您刚才的话已经清楚地表明，您得跟我们上局里去一趟。”","“Well, Mrs. lucca,” said the prosaic Gregson, laying his hand upon the lady’s sleeve with as little sentiment as if she were a notting Hill hooligan, “i am not very clear yet who you are or what you are; but you’ve said enough to make it very clear that we shall want you at the Yard.”"
"“等一等，格雷森，”福尔摩斯说道，“我倒是觉得，咱们很想了解情况，这位女士多半也很想向咱们提供情况，心情跟咱们一样迫切。太太，您的丈夫杀死了摆在咱们眼前的这个人，马上就得面临逮捕和审判，您明白吗？您所说的一切都可能会成为呈堂证供。不过，如果您认为他的行为并不是出于犯罪的动机，并且认为他愿意让人知道自己的动机，那就应该把所有的事情告诉我们，这才是对他最有利的做法。 ”","“One moment, Gregson,” said Holmes. “i rather fancy that this lady may be as anxious to give us information as we can be to get it. You understand, madam, that your husband will be arrested and tried for the death of the man who lies before us? What you say may be used in evidence. But if you think that he has acted from motives which are not criminal, and which he would wish to have known, then you cannot serve him better than by telling us the whole story.”"
"“既然戈尔吉亚诺已经死了，我们也就没什么可害怕的了，”女士说道，“他是个恶魔，又是个畜生，世上没有哪个法官会认为我丈夫杀他是种罪行。”","“Now that Gorgiano is dead we fear nothing,” said the lady. “He was a devil and a monster, and there can be no judge in the world who would punish my husband for having killed him.”"
"“这样的话，”福尔摩斯说道，“我提议咱们让房里的一切维持原状，然后就锁上这道门，跟这位女士一起上她的屋里去，听完她的陈述再下结论。 ”","“In that case,” said Holmes, “my suggestion is that we lock this door, leave things as we found them, go with this lady to her room, and form our opinion after we have heard what it is that she has to say to us.”"
"半个钟头之后，我们四人已经一起坐进了卢卡太太那间小小的起居室，开始听她讲述那些险象环生的离奇事件，至于那些事件的结局，我们已经在偶然的情形之下亲眼目睹。她的英语讲得又快又流利，只可惜十分地不合常规，为了让大家看明白，我会把她的讲述改写成合乎文法的模样。","Half an hour later we were seated, all four, in the small sitting-room of Signora lucca, listening to her remarkable narrative of those sinister events, the ending of which we had chanced to witness. She spoke in rapid and fluent but very unconventional English, which, for the sake of clearness, i will make grammatical."
"“我出生在那不勒斯附近的波西里波，”她说道，“我父亲奥古斯托·巴雷利是当地最有名望的律师，还曾经是当地的议员。吉纳罗在我父亲手下做事，我渐渐地爱上了他，遇见他这样的男人，哪个女人都会心动。他没有钱也没有地位——除了俊俏的模样、坚定的意志和浑身的活力之外，他什么也没有——所以我父亲反对这门亲事。我俩一起逃离家乡，在巴里[^13]结了婚，然后我卖掉自己的首饰，凑够了去美国的盘缠。那是四年之前的事情，接下来，我俩一直都住在纽约。","“I was born in Posilippo, near naples,” said she, “and was the daughter of Augusto Barelli, who was the chief lawyer and once the deputy of that part. Gennaro was in my father’s employment, and i came to love him, as any woman must. He had neither money nor position—nothing but his beauty and strength and energy—so my father forbade the match. We fled together, were married at Bari, and sold my jewels to gain the money which would take us to America. This was four years ago, and we have been in new York ever since."
"“刚开始，命运之神对我俩格外青睐。一位意大利绅士在一个名叫鲍厄里[^14]的地方遇上了几名歹徒，吉纳罗救了他，由此交上了一个很有势力的朋友。那位绅士名叫蒂托·卡斯塔洛蒂，是卡斯塔洛蒂-赞巴商行的大股东，那家商行非常大，是纽约市首屈一指的水果进口商。赞巴先生患有重病，那家三百多号人的商行都由我俩的新朋友卡斯塔洛蒂说了算。他请我丈夫去帮他做事，还让我丈夫主管一个部门，方方面面都对我丈夫特别关照。卡斯塔洛蒂先生是个单身汉，我觉得他把我丈夫看成了自己的儿子，我和我丈夫也把他当成父亲来敬爱。我俩在布鲁克林买了座小房子，置办了家具，整个儿的未来似乎已经有了保障，就在这个时候，那团乌云飘了过来，很快就会盖满我俩头上的那片天空。","“Fortune was very good to us at first. Gennaro was able to do a service to an italian gentleman—he saved him from some ruffians in the place called the Bowery, and so made a powerful friend. His name was Tito Castalotte, and he was the senior partner of the great firm of Castalotte and Zamba, who are the chief fruit importers of new York. Signor Zamba is an invalid, and our new friend Castalotte has all power within the firm, which employs more than three hundred men. He took my husband into his employment, made him head of a department, and showed his good-will towards him in every way. Signor Castalotte was a bachelor, and i believe that he felt as if Gennaro was his son, and both my husband and i loved him as if he were our father. We had taken and furnished a little house in Brooklyn, and our whole future seemed assured when that black cloud appeared which was soon to overspread our sky."
"“一天晚上，吉纳罗下班回家，领了个老乡一起回来。那个老乡名叫戈尔吉亚诺，也是从波西里波来的。他是个大块头，这一点你们都可以作证，因为你们看见了他的尸体。他不光体型夸张，其他方面也是又怪异又夸张，让人非常害怕。他的嗓门儿跟打雷一样，说话的时候不停地挥舞他那两只又长又粗的胳膊，看样子，我俩的小房子还不够他抡开胳膊的呢。他的想法、他的情绪、他的嗜好，全都是特别夸张、特别可怕。他说话的时候更像是在咆哮，劲头大得要命，其他的人只能干坐着听他讲，全都被他那些滔滔不绝的大话给镇住了。他那双眼睛气势汹汹地盯着你，马上就吓得你举手投降。他这个人非常可怕，本事也非常大，谢天谢地，他已经死啦！","“One night, when Gennaro returned from his work, he brought a fellow-countryman back with him. His name was Gorgiano, and he had come also from Posilippo. He was a huge man, as you can testify, for you have looked upon his corpse. not only was his body that of a giant but everything about him was grotesque, gigantic, and terrifying. His voice was like thunder in our little house. There was scarce room for the whirl of his great arms as he talked. His thoughts, his emotions, his passions, all were exaggerated and monstrous. He talked, or rather roared, with such energy that others could but sit and listen, cowed with the mighty stream of words. His eyes blazed at you and held you at his mercy. He was a terrible and wonderful man. i thank God that he is dead!"
"“他一次又一次地上我家来，可我已经意识到，他在的时候，我丈夫并不比我高兴多少。我可怜的丈夫总是愣愣地坐在那里，脸色煞白，无精打采地听我俩的客人没完没了地胡扯，扯的全都是政治和社会问题。吉纳罗什么也没说，可我非常地了解他，于是就从他的脸上看到了一种我从来没看到过的情绪。刚开始我以为那只是厌恶，后来我才慢慢地发现，那不仅仅是厌恶，而是恐惧，深入骨髓、遮遮掩掩、战战兢兢的恐惧。一天晚上，就是我看出他心怀恐惧的那个晚上，我抱住他，恳求他念着他对我的爱，也念着他珍爱的所有东西，再不要跟我隐瞒任何事情，一定要告诉我，那个大块头为什么能把他弄得这么晦气。","“He came again and again. Yet i was aware that Gennaro was no more happy than i was in his presence. My poor husband would sit pale and listless, listening to the endless raving upon politics and upon social questions which made up our visitor’s conversation. Gennaro said nothing, but i, who knew him so well, could read in his face some emotion which i had never seen there before. At first i thought that it was dislike. And then, gradually, i understood that it was more than dislike. it was fear—a deep, secret, shrinking fear. That night—the night that i read his terror—i put my arms round him and i implored him by his love for me and by all that he held dear to hold nothing from me, and to tell me why this huge man overshadowed him so."
"“他告诉了我，听着听着，我自个儿的心也变得一片冰凉。我可怜的吉纳罗有过一段狂野暴烈的日子，那时的他觉得整个世界都在跟自己作对，又被生活当中的种种不平逼得疯疯癫癫，于是就加入了那不勒斯的一个帮会。那个帮会名叫红圈会，跟以前那个烧炭党[^15]差不多，会里的那些誓约和秘密非常可怕，可你一旦入了会，以后就再也别想脱身。我俩逃到美国的时候，吉纳罗以为自己已经永远地摆脱了他们，叫他惊骇的是，一天傍晚，他竟然在大街上遇见了当初在那不勒斯招他入会的那个人。那个人就是大块头戈尔吉亚诺，意大利南部的人都管他叫做‘死神’，因为他手上沾满了杀人的鲜血，一直红到了胳膊肘！为了躲避意大利警方的追捕，他跑到了纽约，并且在自己的新地盘里替那个可怕的帮会办了个分会。吉纳罗把这些事情都告诉了我，还给我看了他当天收到的一张通知。那张通知的抬头画着一个红圈，内容是那个帮会打算在某个日子举行集会，命令他准时出席。","“He told me, and my own heart grew cold as ice as i listened. My poor Gennaro, in his wild and fiery days, when all the world seemed against him and his mind was driven half mad by the injustices of life, had joined a neapolitan society, the Red Circle, which was allied to the old Carbonari. The oaths and secrets of this brotherhood were frightful, but once within its rule no escape was possible. When we had fled to America Gennaro thought that he had cast it all off forever. What was his horror one evening to meet in the streets the very man who had initiated him in naples, the giant Gorgiano, a man who had earned the name of ‘Death’ in the south of italy, for he was red to the elbow in murder! He had come to new York to avoid the italian police, and he had already planted a branch of this dreadful society in his new home. All this Gennaro told me and showed me a summons which he had received that very day, a Red Circle drawn upon the head of it telling him that a lodge would be held upon a certain date, and that his presence at it was required and ordered."
"“这已经够糟糕的了，可是，更糟糕的还在后头呢。一段时间之前，我就已经注意到，到了晚上，戈尔吉亚诺总是会来拜访我们，来了就会跟我说很多话。即便是在冲我丈夫说话的时候，他那双野兽一般的可怕眼睛也总是瞪得溜圆、死死地钉在我的身上。一天晚上，他终于暴露了心里的秘密，让我看清了他称之为‘爱’的那种东西，那只能说是畜生的爱、野人的爱。那天他来的时候，吉纳罗还没有回家，可他强行闯进门来，用他那两只粗大的胳膊抓住我，像熊一样箍住了我，劈头盖脸地吻我，还求我跟他一起走。我正在尖叫挣扎，吉纳罗进了家门，跟着就动手打他。他把吉纳罗打得不省人事，然后就逃之夭夭，再也没有来过。那天晚上，我俩结下的可是一个要命的仇人。","“That was bad enough, but worse was to come. i had noticed for some time that when Gorgiano came to us, as he constantly did, in the evening, he spoke much to me; and even when his words were to my husband those terrible, glaring, wildbeast eyes of his were always turned upon me. one night his secret came out. i had awakened what he called ‘love’ within him—the love of a brute—a savage. Gennaro had not yet returned when he came. He pushed his way in, seized me in his mighty arms, hugged me in his bear’s embrace, covered me with kisses, and implored me to come away with him. i was struggling and screaming when Gennaro entered and attacked him. He struck Gennaro senseless and fled from the house which he was never more to enter. it was a deadly enemy that we made that night."
"“几天之后，通知的开会时间到了。吉纳罗开完会回来的时候，一看他的脸色，我就知道他遇上了可怕的事情。事情非常糟糕，我俩连想都想不到。那个帮会专靠勒索那些富裕的意大利人挣钱，如果他们不给钱，帮会就会用上暴力恫吓的方法。当时的情形似乎是，帮会找上了我俩的好友和恩人卡斯塔洛蒂，可他不光没有屈服于帮会的威胁，还把帮会的警告信交给了警察。帮会已经决定，必须把他做成一个如此这般的榜样，好让其他的勒索对象不敢反抗。按照会上的安排，他和他的房子都会被炸药炸到天上去。会上还有个抽签仪式，为的是决定谁去执行这个任务。吉纳罗把手伸进了抽签的袋子，同时也看到了我俩的那个仇人，看到仇人那张冷酷的脸正在冲他微笑。毫无疑问，他们肯定是预先做了什么手脚，因为落到他手里的正是那张要命的签条，画在上面的红圈就是杀人的命令。这一来，他必须杀死自己最好的朋友，不然的话，他和我就会遭受他那些同志的报复。那个帮会有一套邪恶的规矩，其中一条就是，对于他们害怕的人，或者是他们仇恨的人，他们的惩罚不光针对那些人自己，还会株连那些人的亲人。就是因为知道这条规矩，我可怜的吉纳罗才觉得乌云盖顶，急得都快疯了。","“A few days later came the meeting. Gennaro returned from it with a face which told me that something dreadful had occurred. it was worse than we could have imagined possible. The funds of the society were raised by blackmailing rich italians and threatening them with violence should they refuse the money. it seems that Castalotte, our dear friend and benefactor, had been approached. He had refused to yield to threats, and he had handed the notices to the police. it was resolved now that such an example should be made of him as would prevent any other victim, from rebelling. At the meeting it was arranged that he and his house should be blown up with dynamite. There was a drawing of lots as to who should carry out the deed. Gennaro saw our enemy’s cruel face, smiling at him as he dipped his hand in the bag. no doubt it had been prearranged in some fashion, for it was the fatal disc with the Red Circle upon it, the mandate for murder, which lay upon his palm. He was to kill his best friend, or he was to expose himself and me to the vengeance of his comrades. it was part of their fiendish system to punish those whom they feared or hated by injuring not only their own persons but those whom they loved, and it was the knowledge of this which hung as a terror over my poor Gennaro’s head and drove him nearly crazy with apprehension."
"“当天晚上，我俩搂在一起坐了一整夜，彼此鼓励，准备应付眼前的麻烦。帮会预定的动手时间就在第二天晚上，第二天中午，我和我丈夫已经踏上了来伦敦的旅途。不过，出发之前，吉纳罗已经向我俩的恩人发出了一清二楚的警报，还把相关的情况通知了警方，好让警方保护恩人的生命安全，免得他以后遭人毒手。","“All that night we sat together, our arms round each other, each strengthening each for the troubles that lay before us. The very next evening had been fixed for the attempt. By midday my husband and i were on our way to london, but not before he had given our benefactor full warning of his danger, and had also left such information for the police as would safeguard his life for the future."
"“剩下的事情嘛，各位先生，你们都已经知道了。我俩非常清楚，仇人会像影子一样跟在我俩身后。戈尔吉亚诺想要报复，自然有他私人的理由，就算没有这一层，我俩也知道他这个人是多么的残忍、多么的狡猾、多么的不依不饶。关于他那些可怕的本领，意大利和美国都流传着许多故事。哪怕他从来不曾使尽浑身解数，这一回也肯定会这么做。我俩抢先来到这里，赢得了几天喘息的工夫，我亲爱的人就利用这段时间给我安排了一个避难的地方，而且安排得非常巧妙，让我不会遇上任何危险。他自己则打算独来独往，以便同时跟美国和意大利的警方进行联系。我并不知道他住在哪里，过得怎么样，我知道的一切都是从一张报纸的启事栏里看来的[^16]。不过，有一次我往窗外看了看，发现有两个意大利人正在监视这座房子，于是我立刻明白，戈尔吉亚诺不知道用什么法子找到了我俩的藏身之处。到最后，吉纳罗通过报纸告诉我，他会从某个窗口给我发信号，可他发信号的时候没说别的，只有几句警告，而且还突如其来地断掉了。现在我全都明白了，这一定是因为他突然发现，戈尔吉亚诺已经追到了附近，还有呢，谢天谢地！戈尔吉亚诺追到他的时候，他已经做好了准备。好了，各位先生，我想问问你们，我俩有没有什么法律不能容忍的行为，世上有没有哪个法官会为这次的事情惩办我的吉纳罗？”","“The rest, gentlemen, you know for yourselves. We were sure that our enemies would be behind us like our own shadows. Gorgiano had his private reasons for vengence, but in any case we knew how ruthless, cunning, and untiring he could be. Both italy and America are full of stories of his dreadful powers. if ever they were exerted it would be now. My darling made use of the few clear days which our start had given us in arranging for a refuge for me in such a fashion that no possible danger could reach me. For his own part, he wished to be free that he might communicate both with the American and with the italian police. i do not myself know where he lived, or how. All that i learned was through the columns of a newspaper. But once as i looked through my window, i saw two italians watching the house, and i understood that in some way Gorgiano had found out our retreat. Finally Gennaro told me, through the paper, that he would signal to me from a certain window, but when the signals came they were nothing but warnings, which were suddenly interrupted. it is very clear to me now that he knew Gorgiano to be close upon him, and that, thank God! he was ready for him when he came. And now, gentlemen, i would ask you whether we have anything to fear from the law, or whether any judge upon earth would condemn my Gennaro for what he has done?”"
"“呃，格雷森先生，”美国人看着那位官方代表说道，“我不知道你们英国人会有什么样的看法，不过，据我估计，如果是在纽约，这位女士的丈夫肯定会赢得大多数人的隆重致谢。”","“Well, Mr. Gregson,” said the American, looking across at the official, “i don’t know what your British point of view may be, but i guess that in new York this lady’s husband will receive a pretty general vote of thanks.”"
"“她必须跟我回去见见局里的头儿，”格雷森回答道。“依我看，如果她所言属实的话，她和她丈夫也没有什么好担心的。不过，福尔摩斯先生，叫我完全摸不着头脑的是，你究竟是怎么掺和到这件事情里来的。”","“She will have to come with me and see the chief,” Gregson answered. “if what she says is corroborated, i do not think she or her husband has much to fear. But what i can’t make head or tail of, Mr. Holmes, is how on earth *you* got yourself mixed up in the matter.”"
"“学问哪，格雷森，全都是因为学问，因为我还想在这所古老的大学里学点儿知识。好啦，华生，你那份收藏里又多了一件惨烈怪诞的样本。对了，眼下还不到八点，考文特花园今晚有瓦格纳的歌剧呢！[^17]动作快点儿的话，咱们还能赶上第二幕。”","“Education, Gregson, education. Still seeking knowledge at the old university. Well, Watson, you have one more specimen of the tragic and grotesque to add to your collection. By the way, it is not eight o’clock, and a Wagner night at Covent Garden! if we hurry, we might be in time for the second act.”"
