"他真是个令人难以忍受的人。总的来说，太腼腆。他决不会讲有关自己的事情，而且对他而言这是个负担。一旦他走入你的画室，他从不知道何时该走，而是一直坐着，坐到你几乎要尖叫起来；当他最后红着脸出去时，你气得真想朝他背后扔个炉灶之类的大家伙。奇怪的是，第一眼看上去他挺有意思。大家都这样认为。哪天晚上你溜达到咖啡馆，就会看到他坐在一个角落里，面前放着一杯咖啡，一副瘦黑的大男孩模样，穿一件蓝色针织衫，外罩一件灰色法兰绒小夹克，扣着扣子。他那蓝色运动衫和袖子太短的灰夹克不知为什么使他看起来像一个决心逃到海上去的男孩子。实际上，他已经逃出来了，马上就会站起来，用一根棍子的一端挑起一个系好的包袱，里面装着他的长睡衣和母亲的照片，走向外面的黑夜，淹没其中……上船的路上，在码头边上绊倒，甚至……他留着黑短发，长长的睫毛灰色的眼睛，白色面颊，撅着嘴，好像他是在强忍着不哭出来……人们怎能忍心不理他呢？唉，谁看见他这样都会难受的。而且，好像这还不够，他还有脸红这招……每当侍者走近他时，他就满脸涨红——好像他刚刚出狱，而侍者又知道内情一样……","HE really was an impossible person.Too shy altogether.With absolutely nothing to say for himself. And such a weight. Once he was in your studio he never knew when to go, but would sit on and on until you nearly screamed, and burned to throw something enormous after him when he did finally blush his way out—something like the tortoise stove.The strange thing was that at first sight he looked most interesting.Everybody agreed about that.You would drift into the café one evening and there you would see, sitting in a corner, with a glass of coffee in front of him, a thin dark boy, wearing a blue jersey with a little grey flannel jacket buttoned over it.And somehow that blue jersey and the grey jacket with the sleeves that were too short gave him the air of a boy that has made up his mind to run away to sea.Who has run away, in fact, and will get up in a moment and sling a knotted handkerchief containing his nightshirt and his mother’s picture on the end of a stick, and walk out into the night and be drowned....Stumble over the wharf edge on his way to the ship, even....He had black close-cropped hair, grey eyes with long lashes, white cheeks and a mouth pouting as though he were determined not to cry....How could one resist him?Oh, one’s heart was wrung at sight.And, as if that were not enough, there was his trick of blushing....Whenever the waiter came near him he turned crimson—he might have been just out of prison and the waiter in the know...."
"“他是谁，亲爱的？你了解吗？”","“Who is he, my dear?Do you know?”"
"“了解。他叫伊恩·弗伦奇，画家。人家说他特别聪明。有个女人先是给予他慈母般的温柔体贴。她问他多长时间收到一次家信，床上有没有足够的毯子，每天喝多少牛奶。但是当她走到他的画室前想看看他袜子有没有洗时，她反复按门铃，就是没人应声开门，虽然她都能发誓她肯定听到里面有人在呼吸……绝望啊!”","“Yes.His name is Ian French. Painter.Awfully clever, they say.Someone started by giving him a mother’s tender care.She asked him how often he heard from home, whether he had enough blankets on his bed, how much milk he drank a day.But when she went round to his studio to give an eye to his socks, she rang and rang, and though she could have sworn she heard someone breathing inside, the door was not answered....Hopeless!”"
"另外一个女人断定他应该谈恋爱。她把他唤到身边，称他“孩子”，为了让他嗅到她头发迷人的香味，她向他俯下身来，还挽着他的胳膊，告诉他，人只要有勇气，生活会变得多美妙。某天晚上她走到他的画室前，反复摁着门铃……绝望!","Someone else decided that he ought to fall in love.She summoned him to her side, called him “boy,” leaned over him so that he might smell the enchanting perfume of her hair, took his arm, told him how marvellous life could be if one only had the courage, and went round to his studio one evening and rang and rang....Hopeless."
"“这无聊的年轻人真正需要的是能唤醒他的刺激！”第三个女人说。于是他们一块去咖啡厅、夜总会、小型舞会，那些地方可以喝到号称“香槟”的有点像罐头杏汁味的饮料，但是卖二十七先令一瓶；还有其他地方，惊悚刺激得难以形容，你坐的地方恐怖阴暗，在这之前的晚上总有人在那儿被枪杀。但是他面不改色。只有一次他喝多了，但是仍无进展；他像块石头似的坐在那儿，面颊绯红，哎呀，对了，那副死相就像人们玩的滑稽玩偶，像是一个“弄坏了的玩偶”。但当她把他送回画室的时候，他已经完全恢复常态了。他在楼下的街道上跟她说“晚安”，好像他们是从教堂一起走回家一样……绝望。","“What the poor boy really wants is thoroughly rousing,” said a third.So off they went to café’s and cabarets, little dances, places where you drank something that tasted like tinned apricot juice, but cost twenty-seven shillings a bottle and was called champagne, other places, too thrilling for words, where you sat in the most awful gloom, and where someone had always been shot the night before.But he did not turn a hair.Only once he got very drunk, but instead of blossoming forth, there he sat, stony, with two spots of red on his cheeks, like, my dear, yes, the dead image of that rag-time thing they were playing, like a “Broken Doll.”But when she took him back to his studio he had quite recovered, and said “good night” to her in the street below, as though they had walked home from church together....Hopeless."
"天知道又有多少次失败的尝试——因为女人的慈爱精神是难以泯灭的——她们才放过了他。当然，她们还是那么迷人，请他去看表演，在咖啡馆和他寒暄，但是仅此而已。成了艺术家的人是没时间在意对他没反应的人的，对吧？","After heaven knows how many more attempts—for the spirit of kindness dies very hard in women—they gave him up.Of course, they were still perfectly charming, and asked him to their shows, and spoke to him in the café but that was all.When one is an artist one has no time simply for people who won’t respond. Has one?"
"“而且我真觉得这事肯定有那么点可疑的地方……难道你不觉得？不可能像看起来那么简单！要是想做原野上的一朵雏菊，为什么还来巴黎？不，这不是我多想了。不过——”","“And besides I really think there must be something rather fishy somewhere... don’t you?It can’t all be as innocent as it looks!Why come to Paris if you want to be a daisy in the field?No, I’m not suspicious.But —”"
"他住在一座看起来有些凄凉的高楼顶层，楼房可以俯瞰一条河流。其中有一幢房子在雨夜和月夜里看起来颇具浪漫色彩：那时百叶窗都关闭了，沉重的大门以及写着“一套小公寓现在出租”的广告牌闪着光，透出难以言传的孤寂。另一座楼房整年也嗅不出一丝浪漫气息，看门人住在一楼的一个玻璃笼子里，裹着一条脏兮兮的披肩，一边搅着锅，一边舀出一小块食物给那条懒洋洋地趴在珠垫上的浮肿的老狗……画室身居高空，美景尽收。两扇大窗面对着河水，他可以看到小船和游艇摇来荡去，一座小岛周边种着树，像一扎圆形的花束。侧窗对面是一座更小也更破旧的房子，下面还有一个花卉市场。你可以望见一个个大遮阳伞的伞盖，四周露出的鲜艳的花朵就像镶在伞盖下的花边；还有很多条纹帐篷摊，卖的是盆栽植物和养在陶盆里的一丛丛湿润光泽的棕榈。老太太们像螃蟹一样来来回回地在花间穿梭。他真的没必要到外面去。纵使他一直坐在窗前，直到他的白胡子长得够到窗台，他还能发现可画的东西……","He lived at the top of a tall mournful building overlooking the river.One of those buildings that look so romantic on rainy nights and moonlight nights, when the shutters are shut, and the heavy door, and the sign advertising “a little apartment to let immediately” gleams forlorn beyond words.One of those buildings that smell so unromantic all the year round, and where the concierge lives in a glass cage on the ground floor, wrapped up in a filthy shawl, stirring something in a saucepan and ladling out tit-bits to the swollen old dog lolling on a bead cushion....Perched up in the air the studio had a wonderful view.The two big windows faced the water; he could see the boats and the barges swinging up and down, and the fringe of an island planted with trees, like a round bouquet.The side window looked across to another house, shabbier still and smaller, and down below there was a flower market.You could see the tops of huge umbrellas, with frills of bright flowers escaping from them, booths covered with striped awning where they sold plants in boxes and clumps of wet gleaming palms in terra-cotta jars.Among the flowers the old women scuttled from side to side, like crabs.Really there was no need for him to go out.If he sat at the window until his white beard fell over the sill he still would have found something to draw...."
"若是那些温柔的女人当时成功地闯进他的门，她们会多么惊奇啊。他竟把自己的画室打理得如此整洁。每件东西都摆放有序，就像一帧小巧的“静物画”——带盖的汤锅挂在煤气炉后面的墙上，装着鸡蛋的碗、牛奶罐和茶壶摆在置物架上，书籍和扣着多褶纸罩的灯放在桌上。白天，一幅四边印着阔步前进的红色豹子的印度窗帘罩在床上；床边的墙上，有一张提醒注意的小条，贴在与人躺倒后视线相平的地方，条上用优美的印刷体写着：立刻起床。","How surprised those tender women would have been if they had managed to force the door.For he kept his studio as neat as a pin.Everything was arranged to form a pattern, a little “still life” as it were—the saucepans with their lids on the wall behind the gas stove, the bowl of eggs, milk jug and teapot on the shelf, the books and the lamp with the crinkly paper shade on the table.An Indian curtain that had a fringe of red leopards marching round it covered his bed by day, and on the wall beside the bed on a level with your eyes when you were lying down there was a small neatly printed notice: GET UP AT ONCE."
"每天大致都一样。光线好时，他拼命画画，接下来做饭，整理房间。晚上，他就去咖啡馆，或者坐在家里读书，抑或开列一张最最繁琐的开支单，开头写着：“我应当能够继续做到这些，”最后用一句誓言结尾：“我郑重保证下个月的花销决不会超过这个总数。伊恩·弗伦奇（签名）。”","Every day was much the same.While the light was good he slaved at his painting, then cooked his meals and tidied up the place.And in the evenings he went off to the café, or sat at home reading or making out the most complicated list of expenses headed: “What I ought to be able to do it on,” and ending with a sworn statement... “I swear not to exceed this amount for next month.Signed, Ian French.”"
"这事并没有什么好怀疑的；但是那些看得远的女人是完全正确的，这并非事情的全部。","Nothing very fishy about this; but those far-seeing women were quite right. It wasn’t all."
"有一天晚上，他正坐在侧窗旁边吃着李子干，向空荡无人的花市里的那些大伞盖上抛着果核。雨一直在下——这是今年第一场真正的春雨降临——所有的东西都亮晶晶的，空气中散发着花蕾的芬芳和湿润的泥土气息。许多听起来疲倦又让人高兴的说话声在微暗的空气中回响，要来关窗和拉下百叶窗的人又把身体伸出窗外。在楼下的花市里，树木披上了星星点点的新绿。那是些什么树？他有点好奇。现在点燃街灯的灯夫过来了。他目不转睛地盯着那座房子，那座小小的破旧的房子。突然，好像他的凝视得到了回应，两扇窗户打开，一个女孩手捧一盆水仙花来到外面的小阳台上。她是一个异常瘦削的女孩，围着一个深色的围裙，发髻上扎着一块粉红色的方巾。她把袖子挽得快到肩膀了，细长的胳膊在暗色东西的反衬下显得很有光泽。","One evening he was sitting at the side window eating some prunes and throwing the stones on to the tops of the huge umbrellas in the deserted flower market.It had been raining—the first real spring rain of the year had fallen—a bright spangle hung on everything, and the air smelled of buds and moist earth.Many voices sounding languid and content rang out in the dusky air, and the people who had come to close their windows and fasten the shutters leaned out instead.Down below in the market the trees were peppered with new green.What kind of trees were they? he wondered.And now came the lamplighter.He stared at the house across the way, the small, shabby house, and suddenly, as if in answer to his gaze, two wings of windows opened and a girl came out on to the tiny balcony carrying a pot of daffodils.She was a strangely thin girl in a dark pinafore, with a pink handkerchief tied over her hair.Her sleeves were rolled up almost to her shoulders and her slender arms shone against the dark stuff."
"“的确，天够暖和的。对花儿有好处。”她放下花盆，朝着屋里的一个人说着。当她转过身来时，抬手把几缕头发掖到方巾里。她往下瞧瞧空空荡荡的市场，又向上看看天空。但是，他坐的地方像是空中的一个洞。她完全看不到对面这座楼房。然后她就不见了。","“Yes, it is quite warm enough.It will do them good,” she said, putting down the pot and turning to someone in the room inside.As she turned she put her hands up to the handkerchief and tucked away some wisps of hair.She looked down at the deserted market and up at the sky, but where he sat there might have been a hollow in the air.She simply did not see the house opposite.And then she disappeared."
"他的心也从画室的侧窗跌出来，落到对面房子的阳台上——埋在那盆芽苞半开、绿叶如矛的水仙花的花盆里了……带阳台的那个房间是客厅，紧挨着的那间是厨房。他听得到晚饭后她哗啦哗啦的洗碗声，然后她走近窗户，在窗台上敲打一个小拖把，再把它挂在钉子上晾干。和年轻姑娘通常所做的不同，她从不唱歌，从不披散头发，也不把手臂伸向月亮。她总是围着同一条深色围裙，头发上系同一条粉红色方巾……她和谁一起生活?没有其他人靠近这两扇窗户，不过她常常和屋里的一个人说话。她的母亲，他断定，是个缺乏活动能力的病人。她们在家接针线活做。她的父亲去世了……他生前是个记者——脸色苍白，长胡子，额前垂下一缕黑发。","His heart fell out of the side window of his studio, and down to the balcony of the house opposite—buried itself in the pot of daffodils under the half-opened buds and spears of green....That room with the balcony was the sitting-room, and the one next door to it was the kitchen.He heard the clatter of the dishes as she washed up after supper, and then she came to the window, knocked a little mop against the ledge, and hung it on a nail to dry.She never sang or unbraided her hair, or held out her arms to the moon as young girls are supposed to do.And she always wore the same dark pinafore and the pink handkerchief over her hair....Whom did she live with?Nobody else came to those two windows, and yet she was always talking to someone in the room.Her mother, he decided, was an invalid.They took in sewing.The father was dead....He had been a journalist—very pale, with long moustaches, and a piece of black hair falling over his forehead."
"她们一天到晚地干活，挣的钱仅够维持生活，但是她们从不外出，而且没有朋友。现在，他在桌前坐下来，不得不作出一番全新的誓言声明……在某一时间之前,不要靠近侧窗。伊恩·弗伦奇（签名）。完成当天工作，把画具收好之后才能想她。伊恩·弗伦奇（签名）。","By working all day they just made enough money to live on, but they never went out and they had no friends.Now when he sat down at his table he had to make an entirely new set of sworn statements....Not to go to the side window before a certain hour: signed, Ian French.Not to think about her until he had put away his painting things for the day: signed, Ian French."
"事情相当简单。她是唯一一个他真的想了解的人，因为他认定，她是活人当中唯一一个和他同龄的人。他受不了爱咯咯笑的女孩，也不喜欢成熟的女人……她和他同岁，她——噢，就像他一样。他疲倦地坐在昏暗的画室里，一只胳膊搭在椅背上，凝视着她的窗户，看到自己在那儿，和她在一起。她性情易怒；他们有时吵得很厉害，他和她。她跺着脚，在围裙上绞着双手……这是她大发脾气的习惯。她难得笑。她向他讲起她从前养过的一只可笑的小猫。每次喂它肉吃的时候，那只小猫都要咆哮几声，自以为是只狮子呢。只有类似这样的事情才会让她发笑……但一般说来他们会安安静静地坐在一起；他就像现在这样坐着，她则双手扶膝，两脚藏在下面，低声细语，或者默不作声，因为干了一天活，累了。当然，她从不过问他的画；而他，当然会给她画许多精妙绝伦的画，她却不喜欢这些画，因为他把她画得又瘦又黑……可怎样才能认识她呢?这种情形可能会继续好几年……","It was quite simple.She was the only person he really wanted to know, because she was, he decided, the only other person alive who was just his age.He couldn’t stand giggling girls, and he had no use for grown-up women....She was his age, she was—well, just like him.He sat in his dusky studio, tired, with one arm hanging over the back of his chair, staring in at her window and seeing himself in there with her.She had a violent temper; they quarrelled terribly at times, he and she.She had a way of stamping her foot and twisting her hands in her pinafore... furious.And she very rarely laughed.Only when she told him about an absurd little kitten she once had who used to roar and pretend to be a lion when it was given meat to eat.Things like that made her laugh....But as a rule they sat together very quietly; he, just as he was sitting now, and she with her hands folded in her lap and her feet tucked under, talking in low tones, or silent and tired after the day’s work.Of course, she never asked him about his pictures, and of course he made the most wonderful drawings of her which she hated, because he made her so thin and so dark....But how could he get to know her?This might go on for years...."
"后来，他发现她晚上出来买东西，每周一次。连续两个星期四，她在围裙外又围了条过时的披肩，提着一个篮子，走到窗前。从他坐的地方看不到她那所房子的大门。但接下来的那个星期四晚上，就在同一时间，他抓起帽子就跑下楼梯。一切都笼罩在充满爱意的粉红色的光里。他看到那粉红色的光在河水中闪耀，人们向他走来，他们脸和手也都是粉红色的。","Then he discovered that once a week, in the evenings, she went out shopping.On two successive Thursdays she came to the window wearing an old-fashioned cape over the pinafore, and carrying a basket.From where he sat he could not see the door of her house, but on the next Thursday evening at the same time he snatched up his cap and ran down the stairs.There was a lovely pink light over everything.He saw it glowing in the river, and the people walking towards him had pink faces and pink hands."
"他靠在他的楼房一侧等她，不知道接下来该做什么，说什么。一个声音在他的脑子里说：“她来了。”她迈着轻巧的小步子很快走过来，一只手提着篮子，另一只手拉住披肩两头……他能干什么?只能尾随着……她先去了杂货店,在那儿耗费了很长时间，接着又走进肉店，那里买肉必须按次序等候。然后她又去布店搭配什么东西，过了许久，又去水果店买了一个柠檬。在他注视着她的时候，他明白他比以前更加确定，他必须现在就去结识她。她沉着、严肃又孤单，走路的样子就像急欲和这个成年人的世界了断关系一样，而这一切对他来说却是那么自然、那么必然。","He leaned against the side of his house waiting for her and he had no idea of what he was going to do or say.“Here she comes,” said a voice in his head.She walked very quickly, with small, light steps; with one hand she carried the basket, with the other she kept the cape together....What could he do?He could only follow....First she went into the grocer’s and spent a long time in there, and then she went into the butcher’s where she had to wait her turn.Then she was an age at the draper’s matching something, and then she went to the fruit shop and bought a lemon.As he watched her he knew more surely than ever he must get to know her, now.Her composure, her seriousness and her loneliness, the very way she walked as though she was eager to be done with this world of grown-ups all was so natural to him and so inevitable."
"“是的，她总是那样。”他得意地想，“我们和这些人毫不相干。”","“Yes, she is always like that,” he thought proudly.“We have nothing to do with—these people.”"
"但是现在她已在回家的路上，他还像先前那样离她那么远……她突然进入乳品店，他就隔着窗户看她买鸡蛋。她格外小心地从筐里挑选了一个出来——一个棕色的、形状优美的鸡蛋，若是他也会挑这样一个。当她走出乳品店之后，他走了进去。旋即又出来了，跟着她走过他的楼房，穿过花市，避开一个个大伞，踏着落英和花盆留下的圆印儿……他悄悄地走进她家大门，跟着她上楼，小心翼翼地适时跟进，好不让她发觉。终于，她在楼梯平台停下，从钱包取出钥匙。就在她把钥匙插进房门的时候，他跑了上来，面对着她。","But now she was on her way home and he was as far off as ever....She suddenly turned into the dairy and he saw her through the window buying an egg.She picked it out of the basket with such care—a brown one, a beautifully shaped one, the one he would have chosen.And when she came out of the dairy he went in after her.In a moment he was out again, and following her past his house across the flower market, dodging among the huge umbrellas and treading on the fallen flowers and the round marks where the pots had stood....Through her door he crept, and up the stairs after, taking care to tread in time with her so that she should not notice.Finally, she stopped on the landing, and took the key out of her purse.As she put it into the door he ran up and faced her."
"他的脸比从前更红了，但很严肃地看着她，近乎生气地说：“抱歉，小姐，你落下了这个。”","Blushing more crimson than ever, but looking at her severely he said, almost angrily: “Excuse me, Mademoiselle, you dropped this.”"
"他递给了她一个鸡蛋。","And he handed her an egg."
