"“寓言不会骗人，但是骗子会说寓言。”——利普金","“Parables don’t lie, but liars will parable.”—Lip-King."
"长胡子老头说着暂停了一下，舔了舔他油腻的手指头，然后用手指在他那张破熊皮没能遮住的侧身上抹了抹。在他周围蹲着三个年轻人，都是他的孙子，分别叫鹿跑儿、黄头儿和怕黑儿。他们长得几乎一模一样。他们都披着野兽皮，兽皮遮住了身体的一部分。他们都骨瘦如柴，臀部很窄，腿部弯弯曲曲的，但他们胸脯很厚，胳膊很强壮，手也很大。他们的胸脯、肩膀以及胳膊和腿部的外侧上都长着很多毛。他们的长头发未经修剪，经常一绺一绺地在眼前飘荡着。那又亮又黑的小眼睛就像鸟眼睛一样闪闪发光。他们的脸部轮廓是两眼之间窄，两颊之间宽，下巴很厚，还向外突出着。","Old Long-Beard paused in his narrative, licked his greasy fingers, and wiped them on his naked sides where his one piece of ragged bearskin failed to cover him.Crouched around him, on their hams, were three young men, his grandsons, Deer-Runner, Yellow-Head, and Afraid-of-the-Dark.In appearance they were much the same.Skins of wild animals partly covered them.They were lean and meagre of build, narrow-hipped and crooked-legged, and at the same time deep-chested, with heavy arms and enormous hands.There was much hair on their chests and shoulders, and on the outsides of their arms and legs.Their heads were matted with uncut hair, long locks of which often strayed before their eyes, beady and black and glittering like the eyes of birds.They were narrow between the eyes and broad between the cheeks, while their lower jaws were projecting and massive."
"这是一个星光熠熠的夜晚。在他们的下面是连绵的群山，树林茂密，一直绵延到远处。远方，天空被火山的光亮映得通红。在他们背后，一个山洞张着黑色大口，不时地向外吹出阵阵穿堂风。在他们面前，一堆篝火熊熊燃烧着。篝火的一边，躺着一头吃剩的死熊。在距篝火颇远的地方，还有几条大狗，毛发蓬松杂乱，像狼一样。每个人身边都放着自己的弓箭和一根大棍子。还有许多简陋的长矛靠在洞口的岩石上。","It was a night of clear starlight, and below them, stretching away remotely, lay range on range of forest-covered hills.In the distance the heavens were red from the glow of a volcano.At their backs yawned the black mouth of a cave, out of which, from time to time, blew draughty gusts of wind.Immediately in front of them blazed a fire.At one side, partly devoured, lay the carcass of a bear, with about it, at a respectable distance, several large dogs, shaggy and wolf-like.Beside each man lay his bow and arrows and a huge club.In the cave-mouth a number of rude spears leaned against the rock."
"“我们就是这样从洞里搬到树上的。”长胡子老头大声地说着。","“So that was how we moved from the cave to the tree,” old Long-Beard spoke up."
"他们都放声大笑起来，像大孩子一样。这句话让他们想起了他以前讲过的一个故事。长胡子老头也笑了，笑得他那从鼻子软骨中间横穿过的5英寸长的骨簪都一跳一跳的，让他的样子变得更加凶狠了。他所说的和记载的并不完全相同，但是他发出的动物般的声音表达了同样的意思。","They laughed boisterously, like big children, at recollection of a previous story his words called up.Long-Beard laughed, too, the five-inch bodkin of bone, thrust midway through the cartilage of his nose, leaping and dancing and adding to his ferocious appearance.He did not exactly say the words recorded, but he made animal-like sounds with his mouth that meant the same thing."
"“这就是我所记住的第一件关于海谷的事。”长胡子继续说道，“那时我们这群人非常愚蠢。我们不懂得力量的奥秘。因为，你瞧，每个家庭都独立生活，自己照顾自己。我们这里有三十户家庭，但是我们从不互相帮衬。我们总是互相防范。我们也从不往来。我们各自在树梢上盖一间草屋，并且在屋外的平台上堆很多石头，这样，若偶尔有人想来造访，我们就用石头砸他们。并且，我们还有长矛和箭。我们也从来不在其他人家的树下走动。有一次，我哥哥从老布乌的树下经过，结果头被砸破，送了命。","“And that is the first I remember of the Sea Valley,” Long-Beard went on.“We were a very foolish crowd.We did not know the secret of strength.For, behold, each family lived by itself, and took care of itself.There were thirty families, but we got no strength from one another.We were in fear of each other all the time.No one ever paid visits.In the top of our tree we built a grass house, and on the platform outside was a pile of rocks, which were for the heads of any that might chance to try to visit us.Also, we had our spears and arrows.We never walked under the trees of the other families, either.My brother did, once, under old Boo-oogh’s tree, and he got his head broken and that was the end of him."
"“老布乌非常强壮。据说他可以一下子把一个成年人的脑袋给拧下来。我从来没听说他这样做过，因为没有人愿意给他机会。我父亲也不会。有一天，我父亲去海滩的时候，布乌来追赶我的母亲。她跑不快，因为前一天她上山采浆果的时候被熊抓伤了腿。结果布乌就抓住了她，把她带到自己的树上。父亲再也没把她要回来。因为他害怕。老布乌还朝他扮鬼脸。","“Old Boo-oogh was very strong.It was said he could pull a grown man’s head right off.I never heard of him doing it, because no man would give him a chance.Father wouldn’t.One day, when father was down on the beach, Boo-oogh took after mother.She couldn’t run fast, for the day before she had got her leg clawed by a bear when she was up on the mountain gathering berries.So Boo-oogh caught her and carried her up into his tree.Father never got her back.He was afraid.Old Boo-oogh made faces at him."
"“不过父亲不在乎。当时还有另外一个强人，名叫壮臂。他是个一流的捕鱼好手。可是有一天，他爬上悬崖去找海鸥蛋，从上面摔了下来。从那以后他就再也没力气了。他咳得厉害，两个肩膀都快靠在了一起。所以父亲就抢了壮臂的老婆。每当他来到我家树下咳嗽时，父亲就嘲笑他，还朝他扔石头。那时我们就是这样。我们不懂得怎样齐心协力而变得强大。”","“But father did not mind.Strong-Arm was another strong man.He was one of the best fishermen.But one day, climbing after sea-gull eggs, he had a fall from the cliff.He was never strong after that.He coughed a great deal, and his shoulders drew near to each other.So father took Strong-Arm’s wife.When he came around and coughed under our tree, father laughed at him and threw rocks at him.It was our way in those days.We did not know how to add strength together and become strong.”"
"“会有人抢自己兄弟的老婆吗？”鹿跑儿问道。","“Would a brother take a brother’s wife?” Deer-Runner demanded."
"“如果他搬到另一棵树上自立门户，他就会这样做。”","“Yes, if he had gone to live in another tree by himself.”"
"“可是我们现在就不会做这种事了。”怕黑儿反驳道。","“But we do not do such things now,” Afraid-of-the-Dark objected."
"“那是因为我对你们的父亲教导有方。”长胡子把自己毛茸茸的手伸到熊肉里，抓出一把板油，若有所思地吮吸着。然后，他又把手在腰间露出肉的地方抹了抹，继续说：“我现在跟你们讲的都是很久以前的事，那时候我们什么都不懂。”","“It is because I have taught your fathers better.”Long-Beard thrust his hairy paw into the bear meat and drew out a handful of suet, which he sucked with a meditative air.Again he wiped his hands on his naked sides and went on.“What I am telling you happened in the long ago, before we knew any better.”"
"“你们什么都不懂，一定是傻子。”鹿跑儿这样说，黄头儿也咕哝着表示同意。","“You must have been fools not to know better,” was Deer-Runner’s comment, Yellow-Head grunting approval."
"“我们就是这样，不过我们之后变得更傻了，一会儿你们就知道了。不过，我们还是学到了一些东西，这是必然的过程。我们这些食鱼人还不明白要齐心协力，不懂得将个人的力量转化为群体的力量。但是住在大谷分水岭那边的食肉人却非常团结，他们一起狩猎，一起捕鱼，一起打仗。有一天，他们跑到我们的山谷来了。我们家家户户都躲回了各自的山洞和树上。他们食肉人仅来了十个，但他们一起战斗，而我们却各自为战。”","“So we were, but we became bigger fools, as you shall see.Still, we did learn better, and this was the way of it.We Fish-Eaters had not learned to add our strength until our strength was the strength of all of us.But the Meat-Eaters, who lived across the divide in the Big Valley, stood together, hunted together, fished together, and fought together.One day they came into our valley.Each family of us got into its own cave and tree.There were only ten Meat-Eaters, but they fought together, and we fought, each family by itself.”"
"长胡子掰着手指为难地数了很久。","Long-Beard counted long and perplexedly on his fingers."
"“那时我们有六十个男人，”他努力一边用手指比划一边说，“并且我们的力量非常强大，只是我们自己不懂。我们眼睁睁地看着那十个人围攻布乌家的树。他拼命和他们对攻，但是毫无扭转败局的机会。我们都袖手旁观。有几个食肉人想爬上树，布乌只好出来扔石头砸他们的头，谁知被其他几个早已伺机而动的食肉人射得浑身中箭。布乌就这样送了命。","“There were sixty men of us,” was what he managed to say with fingers and lips combined.“And we were very strong, only we did not know it.So we watched the ten men attack Boo-oogh’s tree.He made a good fight, but he had no chance.We looked on.When some of the Meat-Eaters tried to climb the tree, Boo-oogh had to show himself in order to drop stones on their heads, whereupon the other Meat-Eaters, who were waiting for that very thing, shot him full of arrows.And that was the end of Boo-oogh."
"“接下来，食肉人又去攻打住在山洞里的独眼一家。他们在洞口放了把火，将独眼熏了出来，就像咱们现在放火把狗熊熏出来一样。然后他们爬到树上去抓六指一家，杀了他和他的大儿子。我们这些剩下的人趁机逃跑了。他们还抓走了这里的一些女人，杀了两个跑不快的老人和几个孩子。那些女人都被他们带到大谷里去了。","“Next, the Meat-Eaters got One-Eye and his family in his cave.They built a fire in the mouth and smoked him out, like we smoked out the bear there to-day.Then they went after Six-Fingers, up his tree, and, while they were killing him and his grown son, the rest of us ran away.They caught some of our women, and killed two old men who could not run fast and several children.The women they carried away with them to the Big Valley."
"“之后我们这些剩下的人又悄悄回来了。不知为何，我们一起商量起这件事情来，也许是因为心里害怕，觉得彼此需要的缘故。这是我们的第一次会议——我们第一次真正的会议。而且在那次会议上我们成立了我们的第一个部落。因为我们吸取了教训。那十个食肉人，每个人的力量都足以以一抵十，因为他们十人是团结一致在战斗。他们把力量集中在一起。但是，我们三十户人家，六十个男人，可我们的力量只抵得上一个人，因为我们各自为战。","“After that the rest of us crept back, and, somehow, perhaps because we were in fear and felt the need for one another, we talked the thing over.It was our first council—our first real council.And in that council we formed our first tribe.For we had learned the lesson.Of the ten Meat-Eaters, each man had had the strength of ten, for the ten had fought as one man.They had added their strength together.But of the thirty families and the sixty men of us, we had had the strength of but one man, for each had fought alone."
"“那次我们讨论了很久，但讨论得很艰难，因为那时我们还没有现在说的语言。过了很久以后，一个叫臭虫的人造了一些字，其他的人也陆续造了一些字。但不管怎样，我们最后达成了共识，等到食肉人再翻过分水岭来抢我们的女人时，我们要集中力量，团结一致。就这样，我们有了部落。","“It was a great talk we had, and it was hard talk, for we did not have the words then as now with which to talk.The Bug made some of the words long afterward, and so did others of us make words from time to time.But in the end we agreed to add our strength together and to be as one man when the Meat-Eaters came over the divide to steal our women.And that was the tribe."
"“我们派了两个人在分水岭上放哨，一个白天站，一个晚上站，以防食肉人过来。这两人是整个部落的耳目。同时，还有十个男人每日每夜手持棍棒、长矛和箭，准备打仗。以前，每当一个人捕鱼、捉蛤蚌或者掏海鸥蛋的时候，他都随身带着武器，一边捕获食物，一边防备别人来侵袭。现在情况完全变了。男人们出门不带武器了，他们所有的时间都用来猎捕食物。同样地，每逢女人们进山去挖根茎和浆果的时候，十个男人中会有五个人跟着去保护她们。而且部落的耳目也时时刻刻不分昼夜地在分水岭上监视着。","“We set two men on the divide, one for the day and one for the night, to watch if the Meat-Eaters came.These were the eyes of the tribe.Then, also, day and night, there were to be ten men awake with their clubs and spears and arrows in their hands, ready to fight.Before, when a man went after fish, or clams, or gull-eggs, he carried his weapons with him, and half the time he was getting food and half the time watching for fear some other man would get him.Now that was all changed.The men went out without their weapons and spent all their time getting food.Likewise, when the women went into the mountains after roots and berries, five of the ten men went with them to guard them.While all the time, day and night, the eyes of the tribe watched from the top of the divide."
"“但是麻烦还是来了。照例还是为了女人。没有老婆的男人想要别人的老婆。男人之间战争不断，时不时就有人脑袋被砸碎了，或有人被长矛刺穿了身体。有一次，一个看守人正在分水岭顶上放哨，另外一个人抢走了他的老婆，于是他赶紧下山去与那人搏斗。另外一个看守人因为害怕别人抢走他的老婆，于是也下了山。同时，那十个带武器的男人之间也出了乱子。他们五对五打起架来，结果一些人沿着海边逃跑，另外一些人在后面穷追不舍。","“But troubles came.As usual, it was about the women.Men without wives wanted other men’s wives, and there was much fighting between men, and now and again one got his head smashed or a spear through his body.While one of the watchers was on top of the divide, another man stole his wife, and he came down to fight.Then the other watcher was in fear that some one would take his wife, and he came down likewise.Also, there was trouble among the ten men who carried always their weapons, and they fought five against five, till some ran away down the coast and the others ran after them."
"“这样，我们的部落就没了耳目和守卫了。我们没有了六十个人的力量了。我们根本没有力量可言。所以我们开了一次会议，制定了我们的第一批法律。那时候我还是个毛头小伙子，但是我记得这件事。我们商量着，为了使部落更强大，我们不能互相争斗。我们定了一则法律，谁杀了别人，部落就要处死他。我们还定了另一则法律，规定凡是抢别人老婆的人也要被部落处死。我们还说，无论谁的力量有多大，若他用自己的力气去伤害部落里的其他兄弟，我们也会杀了他，让他不再伤害别人。因为，如果我们由着他伤人，其他兄弟就会害怕，整个部落就会解散。我们又会变得毫无力量，就像食肉人第一次攻打我们并杀死布乌的时候一样。","“So it was that the tribe was left without eyes or guards.We had not the strength of sixty.We had no strength at all.So we held a council and made our first laws.I was but a cub at the time, but I remember.We said that, in order to be strong, we must not fight one another, and we made a law that when a man killed another him would the tribe kill.We made another law that whoso stole another man’s wife him would the tribe kill.We said that whatever man had too great strength, and by that strength hurt his brothers in the tribe, him would we kill that his strength might hurt no more.For, if we let his strength hurt, the brothers would become afraid and the tribe would fall apart, and we would be as weak as when the Meat-Eaters first came upon us and killed Boo-oogh."
"“有一个力气极大的人名叫关节骨，他不知道什么法律。他只知道自己有力气，因此他趁势去抢了三蛤的老婆。三蛤试图反抗，但是关节骨一棍子打得他脑浆直流。可是关节骨忘了我们大家已经齐心协力来维护法律。我们在他家的树下处死了他，把他的尸首吊在树枝上以儆效尤，让大家知道法律比任何人都强大。因为我们就是法律，我们所有人，没有任何人比法律更强大。","“Knuckle-Bone was a strong man, a very strong man, and he knew not law.He knew only his own strength, and in the fullness thereof he went forth and took the wife of Three-Clams.Three-Clams tried to fight, but Knuckle-Bone clubbed out his brains.Yet had Knuckle-Bone forgotten that all the men of us had added our strength to keep the law among us, and him we killed, at the foot of his tree, and hung his body on a branch as a warning that the law was stronger than any man.For we were the law, all of us, and no man was greater than the law."
"“后来又出了其他的乱子。哎呀，鹿跑儿、黄头儿和怕黑儿，你们要知道，建立一个部落不容易啊。事情很多，也很琐碎，而且召集所有人开会是件非常麻烦的事情。无论在早上、中午、晚上，甚至在半夜，我们都要开会。我们发现几乎没有时间出去打猎觅食了，因为总是有琐碎的事情需要通过开会来处理，比如指派两个新看守人去代替山上以前的看守人，还有决定分多少食物给那些总是随身带着武器而没有时间去打猎觅食的人。”","“Then there were other troubles, for know, O Deer-Runner, and Yellow-Head, and Afraid-of-the-Dark, that it is not easy to make a tribe.There were many things, little things, that it was a great trouble to call all the men together to have a council about.We were having councils morning, noon, and night, and in the middle of the night.We could find little time to go out and get food, because of the councils, for there was always some little thing to be settled, such as naming two new watchers to take the place of the old ones on the hill, or naming how much food should fall to the share of the men who kept their weapons always in their hands and got no food for themselves."
"“我们需要一个首领来做这些事，他将是会议的发言人，并且要向会议报告他所做的事情。于是我们任命费兹费兹当首领。他也是个力气很大的人，而且极其狡猾。每当他生气的时候，他就像野猫似的发出费兹费兹的声音。","“We stood in need of a chief man to do these things, who would be the voice of the council, and who would account to the council for the things he did.So we named Fith-Fith the chief man.He was a strong man, too, and very cunning, and when he was angry he made noises just like that, fith-fith, like a wild-cat."
"“那十个负责保卫部落的人被派去在山谷最窄处筑一道石墙。女人们、大一点的孩子们和其他男人也去帮忙，最终筑起了一道很牢固的墙。之后，所有家庭走出山洞，走下自己家的树，去石墙后面的掩蔽处搭起了茅草房。这些房子很大，比山洞和树好得多。由于大家齐心协力，，组成了一个部落，所以人人都过得比以前好多了。有了墙、守卫和看守人，大家有更多时间去狩猎捕鱼、拔根须、采浆果；食物越来越多，也越来越好，这样就没有人挨饿了。有一个人，因为小时候被砸伤了腿，得拄拐棍走路，大家都叫他三条腿。他弄来了一些野谷种子，种在山谷里他家附近的地里。他还试着种肥大的根茎和他在山谷里找到的其他东西。","“The ten men who guarded the tribe were set to work making a wall of stones across the narrow part of the valley.The women and large children helped, as did other men, until the wall was strong.After that, all the families came down out of their caves and trees and built grass houses behind the shelter of the wall.These houses were large and much better than the caves and trees, and everybody had a better time of it because the men had added their strength together and become a tribe.Because of the wall and the guards and the watchers, there was more time to hunt and fish and pick roots and berries; there was more food, and better food, and no one went hungry.And Three-Legs, so named because his legs had been smashed when a boy and who walked with a stick—Three-Legs got the seed of the wild corn and planted it in the ground in the valley near his house.Also, he tried planting fat roots and other things he found in the mountain valleys."
"“那堵墙、守卫和看守人保障了海谷的安全，而且因为食物充足，大家不用为了争食物而打仗，所以许多住在两边沿岸山谷的家庭和后面高山的家庭都搬来了。他们原来过着像野兽一样的生活。没过多久海谷就住满了人，数不清住了多少人家。可是，在这之前，本来可以自由使用的、归大家所有的土地已经被瓜分完毕了。三条腿种谷子的时候就先占了一块地。但是大多数人都不在乎土地。我们觉得砌石墙来表明地界是一件蠢事。我们有足够的食物，还需要什么呢？我还记得我和父亲为三条腿砌石墙，然后从他那儿得到了一些谷子作为酬劳。","“Because of the safety in the Sea Valley, which was because of the wall and the watchers and the guards, and because there was food in plenty for all without having to fight for it, many families came in from the coast valleys on both sides and from the high back mountains where they had lived more like wild animals than men.And it was not long before the Sea Valley filled up, and in it were countless families.But, before this happened, the land, which had been free to all and belonged to all, was divided up.Three-Legs began it when he planted corn.But most of us did not care about the land.We thought the marking of the boundaries with fences of stone was a foolishness.We had plenty to eat, and what more did we want?I remember that my father and I built stone fences for Three-Legs and were given corn in return."
"“于是只有少数人瓜分了所有的土地，而且三条腿占了大部分。而且，其他占了土地的人又把土地给了少数几个占住土地不放的人，换来了谷子、肥大的根茎、熊皮和鱼。鱼是农夫用谷子从渔夫那儿换来的。等到我们都明白过来时，所有的土地都已经被瓜分光了。","“So only a few got all the land, and Three-Legs got most of it.Also, others that had taken land gave it to the few that held on, being paid in return with corn and fat roots, and bear-skins, and fishes which the farmers got from the fishermen in exchange for corn.And, the first thing we knew, all the land was gone."
"“大概就在这个时候，费兹费兹死了，他的儿子狗牙当了首领。总之，他要求当首领，理由是他的父亲是前任首领。而且，他认为自己是一个比他父亲更了不起的首领。他一开始的确是一个好首领，工作也努力，这样，会议要做的事情就越来越少了。这时，海谷里出现了新的声音。那是歪嘴。我们本来没有把他放在心上，直到他开始跟死人的灵魂对话。后来，我们都叫他大肥，因为他吃得太多又不干活，长得又圆又壮。一天，大肥告诉我们他知道死人的秘密，而且他能说出上帝的旨意。他和狗牙成了很好的朋友，狗牙还命令大家给大肥建一间草房。大肥在他的房子周围立了很多塔布，并把上帝供在屋子里。","“It was about this time that Fith-Fith died and Dog-Tooth, his son, was made chief.He demanded to be made chief anyway, because his father had been chief before him.Also, he looked upon himself as a greater chief than his father.He was a good chief at first, and worked hard, so that the council had less and less to do.Then arose a new voice in the Sea Valley.It was Twisted-Lip.We had never thought much of him, until he began to talk with the spirits of the dead.Later we called him Big-Fat, because he ate over-much, and did no work, and grew round and large.One day Big-Fat told us that the secrets of the dead were his, and that he was the voice of God.He became great friends with Dog-Tooth, who commanded that we should build Big-Fat a grass house.And Big-Fat put taboos all around this house and kept God inside."
"“渐渐地，狗牙越来越凌驾于会议之上了。会议的成员抱怨起来，并提出要任命一个新的首领，但是大肥代表上帝发言，说不行。并且三条腿和其他占有土地的人也支持狗牙。而且当时在会议里最有势力的人是海狮，地主们偷偷地送给他土地，还有许多熊皮和一筐筐谷子。所以海狮就说大肥的话确实代表上帝的旨意，而且大家必须遵守。不久以后，海狮就被任命为狗牙的发言人，大部分话都由海狮代说。","“More and more Dog-Tooth became greater than the council, and when the council grumbled and said it would name a new chief, Big-Fat spoke with the voice of God and said no.Also, Three-Legs and the others who held the land stood behind Dog-Tooth.Moreover, the strongest man in the council was Sea-Lion, and him the land-owners gave land to secretly, along with many bearskins and baskets of corn.So Sea-Lion said that Big-Fat’s voice was truly the voice of God and must be obeyed.And soon afterward Sea-Lion was named the voice of Dog-Tooth and did most of his talking for him."
"“当时还有个小男人叫小肚子，他的腰很细，看起来好像从来没吃饱过的样子。在河口沙洲减弱了碎浪的威力之后，他在河口里面造了一个很大的捕鱼器。我们从来没有见过或者想过这种东西。他和他的老婆儿子为此干了好几个星期，而我们其他人都对他们的劳动嘲笑不已。然而，当他们造好了之后，第一天捕的鱼比整个部落一个星期捕的鱼还要多，大家都很高兴。河里适合造捕鱼器的地方只剩下一处了。当我和我的父亲以及其他十几个人开始造一个很大的捕鱼器时，守卫就从我们给狗牙造的大草房里出来了。守卫们用长矛刺我们，并让我们走开，因为小肚子已经得到狗牙发言人——海狮的允许，要在那儿造捕鱼器。“当时有很多人抱怨，于是我父亲就召开了一个会议。谁知道他一站起来说话，海狮就用长矛刺穿了他的喉咙，他就这样死了。狗牙、小肚子、三条腿以及所有占有土地的人都说很好。大肥还说这是上帝的旨意。自那以后，再没有人敢在会议上站起来说话了，这样会议就不存在了。","“Then there was Little-Belly, a little man, so thin in the middle that he looked as if he had never had enough to eat.Inside the mouth of the river, after the sand-bar had combed the strength of the breakers, he built a big fish-trap.No man had ever seen or dreamed a fish-trap before.He worked weeks on it, with his son and his wife, while the rest of us laughed at their labours.But, when it was done, the first day he caught more fish in it than could the whole tribe in a week, whereat there was great rejoicing.There was only one other place in the river for a fish-trap, but, when my father and I and a dozen other men started to make a very large trap, the guards came from the big grass-house we had built for Dog-Tooth.And the guards poked us with their spears and told us begone, because Little-Belly was going to build a trap there himself on the word of Sea-Lion, who was the voice of Dog-Tooth.，“There was much grumbling, and my father called a council.But, when he rose to speak, him the Sea-Lion thrust through the throat with a spear and he died.And Dog-Tooth and Little-Belly, and Three-Legs and all that held land said it was good.And Big-Fat said it was the will of God.And after that all men were afraid to stand up in the council, and there was no more council."
"“还有一个叫猪下巴的人开始养山羊。他是从那些食肉人那儿听说养山羊一事的，不久他就有了好多群山羊。其他没有土地、没有捕鱼器的人们为了免于挨饿，乐意为猪下巴干活，替他照看山羊，使它们不受野狗和老虎的侵袭，并且把它们带到山中的牧场吃草。猪下巴给他们山羊肉吃，给他们羊皮穿，以此作为他们的报酬。有时候，他们也拿山羊肉来换鱼、谷子和肥大的根茎。","“Another man, Pig-Jaw, began to keep goats.He had heard about it as among the Meat-Eaters, and it was not long before he had many flocks.Other men, who had no land and no fish-traps, and who else would have gone hungry, were glad to work for Pig-Jaw, caring for his goats, guarding them from wild dogs and tigers, and driving them to the feeding pastures in the mountains.In return, Pig-Jaw gave them goat-meat to eat and goat-skins to wear, and sometimes they traded the goat-meat for fish and corn and fat roots."
"“就在这时候，钱出现了。海狮是第一个想到这个主意的人，他把这个想法跟狗牙和大肥商量了一下。你们瞧，他们三个在海谷里什么东西都要分走一份。每三筐谷子中有一筐是他们的，每三条鱼中有一条归他们，每三只羊中得有一只归他们。他们拿出其中一部分来养活守卫和看守人，剩下的全归他们自己。有时候捕到一大网鱼，他们分到的鱼太多，都不知道该怎么办才好。所以海狮就让女人们用贝壳做成钱——先做成小圆片，然后在每个贝壳上穿一个洞，个个都光滑漂亮。将它们用绳子串起来，这一串一串的东西就称作钱。","“It was this time that money came to be.Sea-Lion was the man who first thought of it, and he talked it over with Dog-Tooth and Big-Fat.You see, these three were the ones that got a share of everything in the Sea Valley.One basket out of every three of corn was theirs, one fish out of every three, one goat out of every three.In return, they fed the guards and the watchers, and kept the rest for themselves.Sometimes, when a big haul of fish was made they did not know what to do with all their share.So Sea-Lion set the women to making money out of shell—little round pieces, with a hole in each one, and all made smooth and fine.These were strung on strings, and the strings were called money."
"“每串值三十或四十条鱼，但是女人们一天做一串只能得到两条鱼。这些鱼都来自狗牙、大肥和海狮各自分到的东西，也是他们吃不完剩下的。这样，所有的钱都归他们所有。然后，他们告诉三条腿和其他地主，他们要用钱来换谷子和根，他们还告诉小肚子说他们要用钱来换鱼，告诉猪下巴说他们要用钱换山羊和奶酪。这样一来，一无所有的人为有产业的人干活，得到钱作为报酬。他用这些钱可以买到谷子、鱼、肉和奶酪。三条腿和所有有产业的人都付钱给狗牙、海狮和大肥。他们付给守卫和看守人的也是钱，守卫和看守人也用钱买食物。并且，因为钱便宜，狗牙就使唤更多人去当守卫。也因为钱容易制造，很多人开始自己用贝壳造钱。可是守卫们用长矛刺死他们，还射得他们满身中箭，因为他们这是想要解散部落。解散部落可不是一件好事。如果这样，食肉人就要越过分水岭把他们全杀光。","“Each string was of the value of thirty fish, or forty fish, but the women, who made a string a day, were given two fish each.The fish came out of the shares of Dog-Tooth, Big-Fat, and Sea-Lion, which they three did not eat.So all the money belonged to them.Then they told Three-Legs and the other land-owners that they would take their share of corn and roots in money, Little-Belly that they would take their share of fish in money, Pig-Jaw that they would take their share of goats and cheese in money.Thus, a man who had nothing, worked for one who had, and was paid in money.With this money he bought corn, and fish, and meat, and cheese.And Three-Legs and all owners of things paid Dog-Tooth and Sea-Lion and Big-Fat their share in money.And they paid the guards and watchers in money, and the guards and watchers bought their food with the money.And, because money was cheap, Dog-Tooth made many more men into guards.And, because money was cheap to make, a number of men began to make money out of shell themselves.But the guards stuck spears in them and shot them full of arrows, because they were trying to break up the tribe.It was bad to break up the tribe, for then the Meat-Eaters would come over the divide and kill them all."
"“大肥是上帝的发言人，但是他收了断肋骨当门徒，并让他当牧师。这样断肋骨就成了大肥的发言人，大肥的大多话都由他来讲。他们两人都由很多仆人来服侍。同样，小肚子、三条腿和猪下巴也有很多仆人。仆人们躺在他们的草屋周围，替他们送信和传达命令。就这样，不干活的人越来越多了，剩下来干活的人就比以前更辛苦了。似乎人们都不愿干活，都想方设法让别人替自己干活。歪眼就找到了这样一个办法。他率先用谷子酿酒。从此以后，他就不再工作了，因为他和狗牙、大肥和其他头目们私下商量好了，他们同意只准他一个人酿酒。但是歪眼并不自己工作。别人来替他酿酒，他付钱给他们。然后，他将酒出售，所有人都用钱来买。然后他送了很多串钱给狗牙、海狮和所有他们这些人。","“Big-Fat was the voice of God, but he took Broken-Rib and made him into a priest, so that he became the voice of Big-Fat and did most of his talking for him.And both had other men to be servants to them.So, also, did Little-Belly and Three-Legs and Pig-Jaw have other men to lie in the sun about their grass houses and carry messages for them and give commands.And more and more were men taken away from work, so that those that were left worked harder than ever before.It seemed that men desired to do no work and strove to seek out other ways whereby men should work for them.Crooked-Eyes found such a way.He made the first fire-brew out of corn.And thereafter he worked no more, for he talked secretly with Dog-Tooth and Big-Fat and the other masters, and it was agreed that he should be the only one to make fire-brew.But Crooked-Eyes did no work himself.Men made the brew for him, and he paid them in money.Then he sold the fire-brew for money, and all men bought.And many strings of money did he give Dog-Tooth and Sea-Lion and all of them."
"“当狗牙娶了第二个老婆，又娶第三个老婆的时候，大肥和断肋骨都为他说话。他们说狗牙和其他人不同，他的地位仅次于供在大肥禁屋里的上帝。狗牙自己也这么说。他还想知道谁在嘀咕他娶了多少个老婆。狗牙让人造了一个大独木舟，并且雇了更多原来干活的人。这些人什么也不做，就只是躺着晒太阳，只有当狗牙要乘船的时候，他们替他划船。同时，他又让虎脸担任守卫队队长，这样虎脸就成了他的左膀右臂。他不喜欢谁，虎脸就替他杀死谁。而虎脸也让另一个人当他的助手，替他发号施令，还替他杀人。","“Big-Fat and Broken-Rib stood by Dog-Tooth when he took his second wife, and his third wife.They said Dog-Tooth was different from other men and second only to God that Big-Fat kept in his taboo house, and Dog-Tooth said so, too, and wanted to know who were they to grumble about how many wives he took.Dog-Tooth had a big canoe made, and, many more men he took from work, who did nothing and lay in the sun, save only when Dog-Tooth went in the canoe, when they paddled for him.And he made Tiger-Face head man over all the guards, so that Tiger-Face became his right arm, and when he did not like a man Tiger-Face killed that man for him.And Tiger-Face, also, made another man to be his right arm, and to give commands, and to kill for him."
"“但是这是件奇怪的事情：日子一天天过去，我们这些剩下来干活的人变得越来越辛苦，但得到的食物反而越来越少。”","“But this was the strange thing: as the days went by we who were left worked harder and harder, and yet did we get less and less to eat.”"
"“但是那些山羊、谷子、肥大的根茎和捕鱼器呢？”怕黑儿大声问，“所有这些东西呢？人们通过劳动不是应该得到更多的食物吗？”","“But what of the goats and the corn and the fat roots and the fish-trap?” spoke up Afraid-of-the-Dark, “what of all this?Was there not more food to be gained by man’s work?”"
"“是这样的。”长胡子同意他的话，“只用三个人负责捕鱼器，所捕的鱼就比没有捕鱼器的时候整个部落所捕的鱼都要多。可是我不是说过吗？我们都是傻子。我们能获得的食物越多，我们吃到的东西就越少。”","“It is so,” Long-Beard agreed.“Three men on the fish-trap got more fish than the whole tribe before there was a fish-trap.But have I not said we were fools?The more food we were able to get, the less food did we have to eat.”"
"“可是事情不是很清楚吗？食物都让许多不干活的人吃光了。”黄头儿追问道。长胡子伤心地点点头。","“But was it not plain that the many men who did not work ate it all up?” Yellow-Head demanded.Long-Beard nodded his head sadly."
"“狗牙的狗给肉喂饱了，那些躺在阳光下不干活的人都养得圆滚滚的。但同时还有很多小孩子饿得大哭，哭着哭着就睡着了。”","“Dog-Tooth’s dogs were stuffed with meat, and the men who lay in the sun and did no work were rolling in fat, and, at the same time, there were little children crying themselves to sleep with hunger biting them with every wail.”"
"鹿跑儿听了这个挨饿的故事，受了刺激，撕下一大块熊肉，穿在一根棍子上放在炭火上烤。他一边吧唧吧唧吃肉，一边听长胡子继续讲故事：","Deer-Runner was spurred by the recital of famine to tear out a chunk of bear-meat and broil it on a stick over the coals.This he devoured with smacking lips, while Long-Beard went on:"
"“每当我们抱怨的时候，大肥就站起来代表上帝说话。他说那些拥有土地、山羊和捕鱼器以及酿酒的聪明人是上帝选定的。如果没有这些聪明人，我们都会是动物，仍然过着我们从前在树上过的日子。","“When we grumbled Big-Fat arose, and with the voice of God said that God had chosen the wise men to own the land and the goats and the fish-trap, and the fire-brew, and that without these wise men we would all be animals, as in the days when we lived in trees."
"“这时候出现了一个为国王唱歌的人。人们叫他臭虫，因为他又瘦又小，脸和四肢都很难看，干活或者办事都不如别人。他喜欢吃最肥的骨髓、最好的鱼肉、最新鲜的热山羊奶，还有初熟的谷子，他还喜欢火堆边最舒服的地方。于是，他当了为国王唱歌的歌手，找到了不干一点儿事还养得肥肥胖胖的路子。后来人们越来越不满，一些人还往国王的草屋里扔石头，这时臭虫就唱歌，唱做一个食鱼人多么幸福。在他的歌里，他说食鱼人是被上帝选定的人，是上帝造的人中最好的。他唱食肉人都是猪和乌鸦，还唱如果食鱼人去杀死食肉人，为上帝的事情而战死，是多么美好的一件事。他的这些歌词就像火一样在我们心里燃烧，我们都吵着让国王带领我们去跟食肉人打仗。这样我们就忘了自己在挨饿，忘了我们为何抱怨，还高高兴兴地由虎脸率领跨过分水岭。我们在那里杀了很多食肉人，觉得很满意。","“And there arose one who became a singer of songs for the king.Him they called the Bug, because he was small and ungainly of face and limb and excelled not in work or deed.He loved the fattest marrow bones, the choicest fish, the milk warm from the goats, the first corn that was ripe, and the snug place by the fire.And thus, becoming singer of songs to the king, he found a way to do nothing and be fat.And when the people grumbled more and more, and some threw stones at the king’s grass house, the Bug sang a song of how good it was to be a Fish-Eater.In his song he told that the Fish-Eaters were the chosen of God and the finest men God had made.He sang of the Meat-Eaters as pigs and crows, and sang how fine and good it was for the Fish-Eaters to fight and die doing God’s work, which was the killing of Meat-Eaters.The words of his song were like fire in us, and we clamoured to be led against the Meat-Eaters.And we forgot that we were hungry, and why we had grumbled, and were glad to be led by Tiger-Face over the divide, where we killed many Meat-Eaters and were content."
"“不过海谷里的情况并没有好转。要想得到食物，唯一的出路就是为三条腿、小肚子和猪下巴干活，因为已经没有一块土地可以让我们自己种谷子了。常常还有很多人在三条腿和其他人那儿找不到活干。所以这些人只有挨饿，他们的老婆、孩子和老妈妈也都得挨饿。虎脸说，如果他们愿意，他们可以当守卫。很多人当了守卫，从那以后他们不再干活，只顾着用长矛戳死那些干活的人，还有那些抱怨要养活很多吃闲饭的人。","“But things were no better in the Sea Valley.The only way to get food was to work for Three-Legs or Little-Belly or Pig-Jaw; for there was no land that a man might plant with corn for himself.And often there were more men than Three-Legs and the others had work for.So these men went hungry, and so did their wives and children and their old mothers.Tiger-Face said they could become guards if they wanted to, and many of them did, and thereafter they did no work except to poke spears in the men who did work and who grumbled at feeding so many idlers."
"“每逢我们抱怨时，臭虫就唱新歌。他说，三条腿、猪下巴和其余的那些人都是强者，所以他们会拥有那么多东西。他还说，我们应该为有这些强者而感到高兴，否则我们会因为自己的无能而死去，或者被食肉人杀死。因此，我们应该乐于让那些强者去占有所有他们可以得到的东西。大肥、猪下巴和虎脸以及其他这些人都说这是实话。","“And when we grumbled, ever the Bug sang new songs.He said that Three-Legs and Pig-Jaw and the rest were strong men, and that that was why they had so much.He said that we should be glad to have strong men with us, else would we perish of our own worthlessness and the Meat-Eaters.Therefore, we should be glad to let such strong men have all they could lay hands on.And Big-Fat and Pig-Jaw and Tiger-Face and all the rest said it was true."
"“‘好吧，’一个叫长牙的人说，‘那么我也要成为一个强者。’于是他就自己弄一些谷子开始酿酒，卖了很多串钱。这时候，歪眼抱怨起来，长牙说他自己就是一个强者，并说如果歪眼再敢啰嗦，就把他揍得脑袋开花。当时歪眼很害怕，他跑去跟三条腿和猪下巴商量。然后他们三个一起去跟狗牙商量。狗牙告诉了海狮，海狮又派了个跑腿的人送信给虎脸。于是，虎脸派他的守卫烧了长牙的房子，还毁了他酿的酒。他们还杀了他和他全家人。大肥说这样做很好，于是臭虫又唱了另一支歌，唱到服从法律有多好，唱到海谷是多么好的地方，还唱到所有热爱海谷的人都应该出发去杀那些坏蛋食肉人。他的歌又一次燃起了我们心中的火，又让我们忘了怨言。","“‘All right,’ said Long-Fang, ‘then will I, too, be a strong man.’  And he got himself corn, and began to make fire-brew and sell it for strings of money.And, when Crooked-Eyes complained, Long-Fang said that he was himself a strong man, and that if Crooked-Eyes made any more noise he would bash his brains out for him.Whereat Crooked-Eyes was afraid and went and talked with Three-Legs and Pig-Jaw.And all three went and talked to Dog-Tooth.And Dog-Tooth spoke to Sea-Lion, and Sea-Lion sent a runner with a message to Tiger-Face.And Tiger-Face sent his guards, who burned Long-Fang’s house along with the fire-brew he had made.Also, they killed him and all his family.And Big-Fat said it was good, and the Bug sang another song about how good it was to observe the law, and what a fine land the Sea Valley was, and how every man who loved the Sea Valley should go forth and kill the bad Meat-Eaters.And again his song was as fire to us, and we forgot to grumble."
"“说来这真是非常奇怪。每当小肚子捕的鱼太多，他卖很多条才能得到一点点钱，这时他就把许多鱼又放回海里，然后把剩下的鱼以更高的价钱卖出去。三条腿也经常让大片的土地荒着以提高谷价。同时，因为女人用贝壳造的钱太多了，人们要用很多钱才能买到东西，于是狗牙就不让再造钱了。这样，女人们就没活干了，只好去干男人们的活。我本来在捕鱼器上干活，每五天得一串钱。但是我的姊妹顶了我的工作，每十天才得一串钱。女人们的工钱变少了，食物也变少了，虎脸说我们应该去当守卫。只有我不能去当守卫，因为我的一条腿是跛的，虎脸不要我。当时还有许多人像我一样。我们都是残废，只配去求别人给一点儿活干，或者在女人们干活的时候照看她们的孩子。”","“It was very strange.When Little-Belly caught too many fish, so that it took a great many to sell for a little money, he threw many of the fish back into the sea, so that more money would be paid for what was left.And Three-Legs often let many large fields lie idle so as to get more money for his corn.And the women, making so much money out of shell that much money was needed to buy with, Dog-Tooth stopped the making of money.And the women had no work, so they took the places of the men.I worked on the fish-trap, getting a string of money every five days.But my sister now did my work, getting a string of money for every ten days.The women worked cheaper, and there was less food, and Tiger-Face said we should become guards.Only I could not become a guard because I was lame of one leg and Tiger-Face would not have me.And there were many like me.We were broken men and only fit to beg for work or to take care of the babies while the women worked.”"
"这时，黄头儿也被这些话弄饿了，也在炭火上烤了一块熊肉。","Yellow-Head, too, was made hungry by the recital and broiled a piece of bear-meat on the coals."
"“可是你们，你们所有人为什么不起来反抗呢？为什么不杀掉三条腿、猪下巴、大肥和其他那些人好填饱肚子呢？”怕黑儿问道。“因为我们不懂要这么做。”长胡子回答道，“我们的顾虑太多，并且那些守卫们会用长矛刺死我们，而且我们还会顾忌到大肥口中的上帝和臭虫唱的新歌。即使有人想到了，说了出来，虎脸和守卫就会抓住他，在低潮时把他绑在岩石上，让潮水在涨潮时溺死他。","“But why didn’t you rise up, all of you, and kill Three-Legs and Pig-Jaw and Big-Fat and the rest and get enough to eat?” Afraid-in-the-Dark demanded.“Because we could not understand,” Long-Beard answered.“There was too much to think about, and, also, there were the guards sticking spears into us, and Big-Fat talking about God, and the Bug singing new songs.And when any man did think right, and said so, Tiger-Face and the guards got him, and he was tied out to the rocks at low tide so that the rising waters drowned him."
"“钱这个东西真是奇怪。它就像臭虫唱的那些歌。它看起来很好，其实不是那么回事，我们也不容易弄明白。狗牙开始把钱收回。他把钱堆成一大堆，放在一间草屋里，派守卫日夜看守。他堆在房子里的钱越多，钱的价值就越高。所以一个人要比从前干更长时间的活才能得到一串钱。那时，大家还老是谈论着跟食肉人打仗。狗牙和虎脸囤积了谷子、干鱼、熏山羊肉和奶酪，装满了许多间房子。食物堆积如山，可是人们却吃不饱。可是这又有什么关系呢？每当人们怨声载道的时候，臭虫就开始唱新歌。大肥就会说我们应该奉上帝的旨意去杀食肉人，于是虎脸就带领我们越过分水岭去杀人，也有人战死在那里。我当守卫不够格，也干不了那种只晒太阳光养膘的差事，但是每逢打仗的时候，虎脸都乐意带上我。等到我们把房间里的存粮吃完了，我们就收兵回来干活，囤积更多的粮食。","“It was a strange thing—the money.It was like the Bug’s songs.It seemed all right, but it wasn’t, and we were slow to understand.Dog-Tooth began to gather the money in.He put it in a big pile, in a grass house, with guards to watch it day and night.And the more money he piled in the house the dearer money became, so that a man worked a longer time for a string of money than before.Then, too, there was always talk of war with the Meat-Eaters, and Dog-Tooth and Tiger-Face filled many houses with corn, and dried fish, and smoked goat-meat, and cheese.And with the food, piled there in mountains the people had not enough to eat.But what did it matter?Whenever the people grumbled too loudly the Bug sang a new song, and Big-Fat said it was God’s word that we should kill Meat-Eaters, and Tiger-Face led us over the divide to kill and be killed.I was not good enough to be a guard and lie fat in the sun, but, when we made war, Tiger-Face was glad to take me along.And when we had eaten, all the food stored in the houses we stopped fighting and went back to work to pile up more food.”"
"“你们那时全都是疯子。”鹿跑儿说。","“Then were you all crazy,” commented Deer-Runner."
"“那时我们的确都是疯子。”长胡子赞同道，“这真奇怪，这一切真奇怪。有一个人叫裂鼻。他说一切都不对劲。他说通过齐心协力，我们是变得强大了。他又说当初成立部落的时候，我们杀掉了那些仗着自己力气大而去破坏部落的人——那些打碎兄弟脑袋、偷走兄弟老婆的人，这些事情做得都很对。他说，而现在，部落非但没有变得更强，却变得更弱了，因为有些人得到了另外一种力量，这些人在破坏着整个部落——拥有土地力量的人，像三条腿，拥有捕鱼器力量的人，比如小肚子，以及拥有山羊肉力量的人，像猪下巴。裂鼻说，我们应该做的是去剥夺这些人的罪恶力量，驱使他们去干活，他们所有人都得去，而且不劳动者不得食。","“Then were we indeed all crazy,” Long-Beard agreed.“It was strange, all of it.There was Split-Nose.He said everything was wrong.He said it was true that we grew strong by adding our strength together.And he said that, when we first formed the tribe, it was right that the men whose strength hurt the tribe should be shorn of their strength—men who bashed their brothers’ heads and stole their brothers’ wives.And now, he said, the tribe was not getting stronger, but was getting weaker, because there were men with another kind of strength that were hurting the tribe—men who had the strength of the land, like Three-Legs; who had the strength of the fish-trap, like Little-Belly; who had the strength of all the goat-meat, like Pig-Jaw.The thing to do, Split-Nose said, was to shear these men of their evil strength; to make them go to work, all of them, and to let no man eat who did not work."
"“于是臭虫又唱了一首歌，唱道像裂鼻那样的人就是想要回到过去，重回树上的生活。","“And the Bug sang another song about men like Split-Nose, who wanted to go back, and live in trees."
"“但是裂鼻说不是这样，他并不想回到过去，而是要向前走。他说他们只有团结起来才会变得强大。他还说，如果食鱼人愿意和食肉人团结起来，那就不会有战争，不需要守卫和看守人。如果所有人都工作，食物就会很充足，一个人一天只要工作两小时就行了。“当时臭虫又唱了，他唱裂鼻是个懒汉，他还唱了一首‘蜜蜂之歌’。这是一首奇怪的歌，听到歌的人都像喝了烈酒一样发疯。它讲的是一群蜜蜂和一只黄蜂大盗。黄蜂过来和蜜蜂们住在一起，偷走了它们所有的蜂蜜。这只黄蜂很懒，还告诉蜜蜂们不用工作。它还告诉蜜蜂们和熊做朋友，说熊不偷蜂蜜，它们只会是非常要好的朋友。 臭虫把歌词编得很巧妙，让听到的人都知道那群蜜蜂指的是海谷部落里的人，熊指的是食肉人，而那只懒黄蜂指的就是裂鼻。当臭虫唱道蜜蜂们听了黄蜂的话，却害得它们几乎灭亡的时候，大家都咆哮怒吼起来。当臭虫唱道最后善良的蜜蜂奋起把黄蜂蛰死的时候，人们从地上捡起石头把裂鼻砸死了，直到把他埋在石堆里看不见他才善罢甘休。还有很多干活时间长、干活辛苦、吃不饱的穷人们也帮着朝裂鼻砸石头。","“Yet Split-Nose said no; that he did not want to go back, but ahead; that they grew strong only as they added their strength together; and that, if the Fish-Eaters would add their strength to the Meat-Eaters, there would be no more fighting and no more watchers and no more guards, and that, with all men working, there would be so much food that each man would have to work not more than two hours a day.“Then the Bug sang again, and he sang that Split-Nose was lazy, and he sang also the ‘Song of the Bees.’  It was a strange song, and those who listened were made mad, as from the drinking of strong fire-brew.The song was of a swarm of bees, and of a robber wasp who had come in to live with the bees and who was stealing all their honey.The wasp was lazy and told them there was no need to work; also, he told them to make friends with the bears, who were not honey-stealers but only very good friends.And the Bug sang in crooked words, so that those who listened knew that the swarm was the Sea Valley tribe, that the bears were the Meat-Eaters, and that the lazy wasp was Split-Nose.And when the Bug sang that the bees listened to the wasp till the swarm was near to perishing, the people growled and snarled, and when the Bug sang that at last the good bees arose and stung the wasp to death, the people picked up stones from the ground and stoned Split-Nose to death till there was naught to be seen of him but the heap of stones they had flung on top of him.And there were many poor people who worked long and hard and had not enough to eat that helped throw the stones on Split-Nose."
"“裂鼻死了以后，只有一个人敢站起来说出自己的想法，那个人叫毛脸。‘强者的力量在哪儿？’他问道，‘我们全都是强者，我们比狗牙、虎脸、三条腿、猪下巴和所有他们那样的人都强，因为他们什么也不做还吃很多，他们用邪恶的力量来伤害我们、削弱我们。做奴隶的人不会是强者。如果当初发现火的优点和用途的人利用他的力量，我们就会变成他的奴隶。就像如今小肚子发现了捕鱼器的优点和用途，我们便成了他的奴隶。还有些人发现了土地、山羊和酿酒的优点和用途，我们同样也成了他们的奴隶。兄弟们，过去我们住在树上，没有一个人是安全的。但是现在我们彼此间再也不打架了。我们已经同心协力了。那么，就让我们停止和食肉人的斗争吧。让我们和他们团结起来。那时我们真的会变得强大。那时，我们食鱼人和食肉人将一起出去，杀猛虎、狮子、狼和野狗。我们将在山坡上放羊，在每个高山谷里种谷子和肥大的根茎。到那天，我们将变得强大无比，所有野兽都会被我们追得到处逃跑，被我们消灭。而且，没有什么能挡住我们，因为一个人的力量就成了世界上全人类的力量。’","“And, after the death of Split-Nose, there was but one other man that dared rise up and speak his mind, and that man was Hair-Face.‘Where is the strength of the strong?’ he asked.‘We are the strong, all of us, and we are stronger than Dog-Tooth and Tiger-Face and Three-Legs and Pig-Jaw and all the rest who do nothing and eat much and weaken us by the hurt of their strength which is bad strength.Men who are slaves are not strong.If the man who first found the virtue and use of fire had used his strength we would have been his slaves, as we are the slaves to-day of Little-Belly, who found the virtue and use of the fish-trap; and of the men who found the virtue and use of the land, and the goats, and the fire-brew.Before, we lived in trees, my brothers, and no man was safe.But we fight no more with one another.We have added our strength together.Then let us fight no more with the Meat-Eaters.Let us add our strength and their strength together.Then will we be indeed strong.And then we will go out together, the Fish-Eaters and the Meat-Eaters, and we will kill the tigers and the lions and the wolves and the wild dogs, and we will pasture our goats on all the hill-sides and plant our corn and fat roots in all the high mountain valleys.In that day we will be so strong that all the wild animals will flee before us and perish.And nothing will withstand us, for the strength of each man will be the strength of all men in the world.’"
"“毛脸说了这些以后就被他们杀死了，他们说因为他是一个野人，想回到过去，住到树上去。这真的非常奇怪。每逢有人站起来说要向前走的时候，那些站着不动的人就说他要后退，应该被杀死。穷人们也帮着向他扔石头，真是傻子。除了那些不干活却养得肥肥胖胖的人之外，我们都是傻子。当时大家都把傻瓜当成聪明人，而真正聪明的人被砸死了。干活的人不一定吃得饱，不干活的人反而吃撑了。","“So said Hair-Face, and they killed him, because, they said, he was a wild man and wanted to go back and live in a tree.It was very strange.Whenever a man arose and wanted to go forward all those that stood still said he went backward and should be killed.And the poor people helped stone him, and were fools.We were all fools, except those who were fat and did no work.The fools were called wise, and the wise were stoned.Men who worked did not get enough to eat, and the men who did not work ate too much."
"“因此部落就开始失去了力量。孩子们都体弱多病。而且因为我们吃不饱，各种奇怪的病症开始在我们中间蔓延，人们像苍蝇一样死去。后来食肉人来攻打我们了。过去，我们频繁地跟着虎脸跨过分水岭去杀他们。现在他们要来让我们血债血还了。我们因为体弱多病，守不住那堵大墙了。他们带走了一些女人，杀光了我们所有剩下的人。只有臭虫和我逃走了。我藏在最荒凉的地方，成了一个有肉吃的猎人，再也不会挨饿了。我从食肉人那儿偷了一个老婆，然后去高山上的山洞里住下了，这样他们就找不到我。我们后来有了三个儿子，每个儿子都从食肉人那儿偷来了一个老婆。后来的你们都知道了，你们不就是我儿子的儿子吗？”","“And the tribe went on losing strength.The children were weak and sickly.And, because we ate not enough, strange sicknesses came among us and we died like flies.And then the Meat-Eaters came upon us.We had followed Tiger-Face too often over the divide and killed them.And now they came to repay in blood.We were too weak and sick to man the big wall.And they killed us, all of us, except some of the women, which they took away with them.The Bug and I escaped, and I hid in the wildest places, and became a hunter of meat and went hungry no more.I stole a wife from the Meat-Eaters, and went to live in the caves of the high mountains where they could not find me.And we had three sons, and each son stole a wife from the Meat-Eaters.And the rest you know, for are you not the sons of my sons?”"
"“但是臭虫呢？”鹿跑儿问道，“他后来怎么样了？”","“But the Bug?” queried Deer-Runner.“What became of him?”"
"“他去和食肉人住在了一起，又做了给国王唱歌的人。他现在老了，但他还是唱同样的老歌。每当有人站起来要前进的时候，他就唱那个人是要退回去住在树上。”","“He went to live with the Meat-Eaters and to be a singer of songs to the king.He is an old man now, but he sings the same old songs; and, when a man rises up to go forward, he sings that that man is walking backward to live in a tree.”"
"长胡子把手伸到熊的尸体里，挖出一把板油，用他那没有牙的牙龈吮吸着。","Long-Beard dipped into the bear-carcass and sucked with toothless gums at a fist of suet."
"“总有一天，”他把手在侧身上抹了几下，说道，“所有傻子都被杀死了，然后活着的人将向前走。到那时候，强者的力量将会归他们所有，他们会把力量集中起来，因此，全世界的人都不会相互打架。那时城墙上就不会再有守卫和看守人了。所有野兽都会被杀死，就像毛脸说的一样，所有山坡上都可以放羊，所有高山谷里都可以种谷子和肥大的根茎。这样，所有人都成了兄弟，再没有人躺在阳光下无所事事而让别人来养活他。这一切总会实现的。到那个时候，傻瓜都会死光，再不会有歌手站着不动唱‘蜜蜂之歌’了。蜜蜂并不是人啊。”","“Some day,” he said, wiping his hands on his sides, “all the fools will be dead and then all live men will go forward.The strength of the strong will be theirs, and they will add their strength together, so that, of all the men in the world, not one will fight with another.There will be no guards nor watchers on the walls.And all the hunting animals will be killed, and, as Hair-Face said, all the hill-sides will be pastured with goats and all the high mountain valleys will be planted with corn and fat roots.And all men will be brothers, and no man will lie idle in the sun and be fed by his fellows.And all that will come to pass in the time when the fools are dead, and when there will be no more singers to stand still and sing the ‘Song of the Bees.’  Bees are not men.”"
