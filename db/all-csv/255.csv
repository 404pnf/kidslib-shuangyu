"有这么一个漂亮女人，上帝赋予了她一切优越的条件，然而她却不怎么走运。她为爱而结婚，而最终这爱情却只是一场空。她有几个美丽健康的孩子，然而她却觉得那是强加给她的，她并不能去爱他们。他们看她的时候冷冷淡淡，似乎在挑她的不是。她总是急着想去掩饰自己的一些缺点。要掩盖些什么，她却从不知晓。然而，当孩子们在场时，她总是感到内心深处正变得冷酷无情。这使她很烦恼，在行为举止上她便更加温柔和气，愈发地为孩子们担心，就好像她非常爱他们一样。只有她自己知道，在她的内心深处，有一块小小的坚硬的地方感受不到爱，不，感受不到对任何人的爱。别人总是这么说她：“她是这样一位好母亲。她深爱她的孩子们。”只有她和孩子们清楚，事实绝非如此。他们可以从对方的眼睛里看到这一点。","There was a woman who was beautiful, who started with all the advantages, yet she had no luck.She married for love, and the love turned to dust.She had bonny children, yet she felt they had been thrust upon her, and she could not love them.They looked at her coldly, as if they were finding fault with her.And hurriedly she felt she must cover up some fault in herself.Yet what it was that she must cover up she never knew.Nevertheless, when her children were present, she always felt the centre of her heart go hard.This troubled her, and in her manner she was all the more gentle and anxious for her children, as if she loved them very much.Only she herself knew that at the centre of her heart was a hard little place that could not feel love, no, not for anybody.Everybody else said of her: “She is such a good mother.She adores her children.” Only she herself, and her children themselves, knew it was not so.They read it in each other’s eyes."
"家里有一个男孩，两个小女孩。他们住在一栋舒适的带花园的房子里，家里有言行审慎的仆人。和街坊四邻中的任何一家相比，他们都觉得自己家高人一等。","There were a boy and two little girls.They lived in a pleasant house, with a garden, and they had discreet servants, and felt themselves superior to anyone in the neighbourhood."
"尽管日子过得奢侈阔气，他们却总感到家里有件让人焦虑的事情。那就是，钱永远都不够花。母亲收入微薄，父亲收入也不高，他们想维持这个家的社会地位，而这些钱却远远不够。父亲在城里任职。尽管前景大好，但这些前景却从未实现过。他们一如既往地过着体面阔气的生活，而缺钱的感觉却使他们备受折磨。","Although they lived in style, they felt always an anxiety in the house.There was never enough money.The mother had a small income, and the father had a small income, but not nearly enough for the social position which they had to keep up.The father went in to town to some office.But though he had good prospects, these prospects never materialized.There was always the grinding sense of the shortage of money, though the style was always kept up."
"终于，母亲开口道：“我倒要看看，我是不是真的什么也做不了。”可是她却不知道从哪里着手。她绞尽脑汁，不断尝试，最终却一事无成。挫败使她的脸上长出了深深的皱纹。孩子们一个个长大了，他们得上学。必须要有更多钱，必须要有更多钱。这位父亲，总是英俊潇洒、喜好奢华，却似乎从来都做不了一件值得一做的事情。而这位极为自信的母亲，像父亲一样喜好奢华，却也比父亲成功不了多少。","At last the mother said: “I will see if @I@ can’t make something.” But she did not know where to begin.She racked her brains, and tried this thing and the other, but could not find anything successful.The failure made deep lines come into her face.Her children were growing up; they would have to go to school.There must be more money, there must be more money.The father, who was always very handsome and expensive in his tastes, seemed as if he never @would@ be able to do anything worth doing.And the mother, who had a great belief in herself, did not succeed any better, and her tastes were just as expensive."
"因此，家里萦绕着一句未曾言明的话：必须要有更多钱！必须要有更多钱！圣诞节，当昂贵耀眼的玩具堆满儿童室时，孩子们便能听到这声音。在闪亮的时髦的木马背后，在洋娃娃居住的漂亮小屋背后，一个声音开始低诉：“必须要有更多钱！必须要有更多钱！”木马正轻轻地摇动着，有低语声从它的弹跳中传来，甚至连似乎正在低头咬着马嚼子的木马自己，也听见了这低语声。粉红色的大玩具娃娃坐在新童车里傻笑，它清楚地听到了这声音，并且似乎因此而傻笑得更加忸怩。还有取代玩具熊的傻乎乎的小狗，它看起来格外傻头傻脑，不是由于别的原因，正是因为它听到了萦绕房中的私语：“必须要有更多钱！”然而却从没有人大声说出来过。这种低语声无处不在，也因此而无人将它说出口。就像没有人说“我们正在呼吸！”一样，虽然事实上人们一直在呼吸。","And so the house came to be haunted by the unspoken phrase: @There must be more money! There must be more money!@ The children could hear it at Christmas, when the expensive and splendid toys filled the nursery.Behind the shining modern rocking-horse, behind the smart doll’s-house, a voice would start whispering: “There @must@ be more money!There @must@ be more money!” It came whispering from the springs of the still-swaying rocking-horse, and even the horse, bending his wooden, champing head, heard it.The big doll, sitting so pink and smirking in her new pram, could hear it quite plainly, and seemed to be smirking all the more self-consciously because of it.The foolish puppy, too, that took the place of the teddy-bear, he was looking so extraordinarily foolish for no other reason but that he heard the secret whisper all over the house: “There @must@ be more money!” Yet nobody ever said it aloud.The whisper was everywhere, and therefore no one spoke it.Just as no one ever says: “We are breathing!” in spite of the fact that breath is coming and going all the time."
"“妈妈，”有一天男孩保罗说，“为什么我们没有一辆自己的车呢？为什么我们总用舅舅的车，不然就坐出租车呢？”母亲说：“因为我们是家族里最穷的。”","“Mother,” said the boy Paul one day, “why don’t we keep a car of our own?Why do we always use uncle’s or else a taxi?” “Because we’re the poor members of the family,” said the mother."
"“为什么是我们最穷呢，妈妈？”“嗯——我想，”她缓慢而苦涩地说道，“是因为你爸爸不走运。”男孩沉默了一阵。","“But why @are@ we, mother?” “Well—I suppose,” she said slowly and bitterly, “it’s because your father has no luck.” The boy was silent for some time."
"“运气是钱吗，妈妈？”他怯生生地问道。","“Is luck money, mother?” he asked, rather timidly."
"“不是，保罗。不完全是。它能让你有钱。”“噢！”保罗似懂非懂地说道，　“当奥斯卡舅舅说到‘不义之财’的时候，我还以为指的是钱呢。”（注：此处男孩将lucre“钱财”和lucker“运气”的发音混淆了。）“‘不义之财’确实指的是钱，”母亲说，“但那是钱财，不是运气。”“噢！”男孩说，“那运气是什么呢，妈妈？”“它能让你有钱。如果你运气好，你就会有钱。所以生来就走运，比生来就有钱更好。要是你生来就有钱，你可能会花完。可要是你生来就走运，你总会赚到更多的钱。”“噢！是吗？那爸爸不走运吗？”“应该说，他很不走运。”她痛苦地说道。","“No, Paul.Not quite.It’s what causes you to have money.” “Oh!” said Paul vaguely.“I thought when Uncle Oscar said @filthy lucker@, it meant money.” “@Filthy lucre@ does mean money,” said the mother, “But it’s lucre, not luck.” “Oh!” said the boy.“Then what @is@ luck, mother?” “It’s what causes you to have money.If you’re lucky you have money.That’ s why it’s better to be born lucky than rich.If you’re rich, you may lose your money.But if you’re lucky, you will always get more money.” “Oh!Will you?And is father not lucky?” “Very unlucky, I should say,” she said bitterly."
"男孩将信将疑地注视着她。","The boy watched her with unsure eyes."
"“为什么呢？”他问。","“Why?” he asked."
"“我不知道。没有人知道为什么一个人走运，而另一个人不走运。”“是吗？谁都不知道？没有人知道吗？”“也许上帝知道吧。可他从不告诉大家。”“那他应该告诉大家。妈妈，难道你也不走运吗？”“嫁了个不走运的丈夫，我也不可能走运。”“但是就你自己的时候呢？”“结婚前，我总以为自己很走运。可现在，我觉得自己实在是不走运。”“为什么？”“嗯——管它呢！也许我并不是真的不走运。”她说道。","“I don’t know.Nobody ever knows why one person is lucky and another unlucky.” “Don’t they?Nobody at all?Does @nobody@ know?” “Perhaps God.But He never tells.” “He ought to, then.And aren’t you lucky either, mother?” “I can’t be, if I married an unlucky husband.” “But by yourself, aren’t you?” “I used to think I was, before I married.Now I think I am very unlucky indeed.” “Why?” “Well—never mind!Perhaps I’m not really,” she said."
"孩子看着她，想知道她是不是在说真话。可是从她的口型他就知道，她只是在试图对他掩饰些什么。","The child looked at her, to see if she meant it.But he saw, by the lines of her mouth, that she was only trying to hide something from him."
"“好吧，不管怎样，”他坚定地说，“我是个走运的人。”“为什么？”母亲突然笑了，她问道。","“Well, anyhow,” he said stoutly, “I’m a lucky person.” “Why?” said his mother, with a sudden laugh."
"他盯着她。连他自己都不知道为什么说了这样的话。","He stared at her.He didn’t even know why he had said it."
"“上帝告诉我的。”他坚持这么说，准备厚着脸皮硬挺过去。","“God told me,” he asserted, brazening it out."
"“我希望上帝告诉你了，亲爱的！”“妈妈！他告诉我了。”“太棒了！”母亲说道，她用了她丈夫常说的一个感叹句。","“I hope He did, dear!” “He did, mother!” “Excellent!” said the mother, using one of her husband’s exclamations."
"男孩看见母亲并不相信他，或者，更确切地说，她根本就不关心自己的断言。这让他稍微有些恼火，使他想迫使母亲注意他。","The boy saw she did not believe him; or, rather, that she paid no attention to his assertion.This angered him somewhat, and made him want to compel her attention."
"他茫然地独自走开了，以一种孩子的方式去寻找“运气”的线索。他聚精会神，丝毫注意不到别人，带着一丝诡秘，四处暗自寻找着运气。他想要运气，他想要它，太想要了！当两个小女孩在儿童室玩洋娃娃时，他会坐在自己的大木马上，疯狂地向空气里猛冲，这使得小女孩们不安地凝视着他。木马狂烈地猛冲，男孩卷曲的深色头发不断颤动着，他的眼里出现了一种奇异的光芒。小女孩们不敢跟他说话。","He went off by himself, vaguely, in a childish way, seeking for the clue to “luck.” Absorbed, taking no heed of other people, he went about with a sort of stealth, seeking inwardly for luck.He wanted luck, he wanted it, he wanted it.When the two girls were playing dolls in the nursery, he would sit on his big rocking-horse, charging madly into space, with a frenzy that made the little girls peer at him uneasily.Wildly the horse careered, the waving dark hair of the boy tossed, his eyes had a strange glare in them.The little girls dared not speak to him."
"终于，短暂而疯狂的木马之旅告一段落，他爬了下去，站在木马前，死死地盯着它低垂的脸。木马红色的嘴巴微微张着，像玻璃般明亮的眼睛睁得大大的。","When he had ridden to the end of his mad little journey, he climbed down and stood in front of his rocking-horse, staring fixedly into its lowered face.Its red mouth was slightly open, its big eye was wide and glassy-bright."
"“现在！”他无声地命令这匹喷着鼻息的骏马，“现在，带我到有运气的地方去！现在就带我去！”接下来，他用从奥斯卡舅舅那里要来的小鞭子，抽打马的脖子。他知道只要他强迫这匹马，它就会带着自己到有运气的地方去。所以他再一次爬上马背，继续开始他猛烈的骑马之旅，希望最终到达目的地。他知道自己能到达目的地。","“Now!” he would silently command the snorting steed, “Now, take me to where there is luck!Now take me!” And he would slash the horse on the neck with the little whip he had asked Uncle Oscar for.He @knew@ the horse could take him to where there was luck, if only he forced it.So he would mount again, and start on his furious ride, hoping at last to get there.He knew he could get there."
"“你会把木马弄坏的，保罗！”保姆说道。","“You’ll break your horse, Paul!” said the nurse."
"“他总是那样骑！我希望他别再那样骑木马了！”他的大妹妹琼说。","“He always riding like that!I wish he’d leave off!” said his elder sister Joan."
"可他只是一声不吭地朝下瞪着她们。保姆自动认输。她拿他没办法。毕竟，他长大了，她管不住他了。","But he only glared down on them in silence.Nurse gave him up.She could make nothing of him.Anyhow he was growing beyond her."
"他无数次疯狂地骑马旅行。一天，当他正猛烈地骑着木马时，妈妈和奥斯卡舅舅进来了。他没有跟他们说话。","One day his mother and his Uncle Oscar came in when he was on one of his furious rides.He did not speak to them."
"“嘿！小骑手！获胜了吗？”舅舅说。","“Hallo, you young jockey!Riding a winner?” said his uncle."
"“你不觉得自己长大了，不再适合骑木马了吗？你知道，你已经不是个小孩子了。”妈妈说道。","“Aren’t you growing too big for a rocking-horse?You’re not a very little boy any longer, you know,” said his mother."
"但保罗只是瞪着那双靠得很近的大眼睛，眼里发出蓝色的光芒。他全力冲刺的时候是不会跟任何人说话的。母亲注视着他，一脸焦虑的神情。","But Paul only gave a blue glare from his big, rather close-set eyes.He would speak to nobody when he was in full tilt.His mother watched him with an anxious expression on her face."
"最后，他突然停下来，不再强迫他的马机械地奔驰，然后从马背上溜了下来。","At last he suddenly stopped forcing his horse into the mechanical gallop, and slid down."
"“嘿，我到了那里！”他狂热地宣布道，蓝眼睛仍在熠熠发光，强健修长的双腿叉开站着。","“Well, I got there!” he announced fiercely, his blue eyes still flaring, and his sturdy long legs straddling apart."
"“你到了什么地方？”妈妈问道。","“Where did you get to?” asked his mother."
"“我想去的地方。”他目光炯炯地望着她说。","“Where I wanted to go,” he flared back at her."
"“对极了，孩子！”奥斯卡舅舅说。“不要停下来，一直坚持直到到达目的地。这马叫什么名字？”“它没有名字。”男孩说。","“That’s right, son!” said Uncle Oscar.“Don’t you stop till you get there.What’s the horse’s name?” “He doesn’t have a name,” said the boy."
"“没有名字也行？”奥斯卡舅舅问道。","“Gets on without all right?” asked the uncle."
"“嗯，它有不同的名字。上周它叫做桑索维诺。”“桑索维诺，嗯？阿斯科特赛马会的优胜者。你怎么知道它的名字？”“他总跟巴西特谈赛马的事情。”琼说道。","“Well, he has different names.He was called Sansovino last week.” “Sansovino, eh?Won the Ascot.How did you know his name?” “He always talks about horse-races with Bassett,” said Joan."
"舅舅十分欣喜地发现，他的这位小外甥知道所有关于赛马的消息。年轻的园丁巴西特在战争中左脚负伤，他曾经做过奥斯卡·克雷斯韦尔的勤务兵，通过这层关系得到了现在这份工作。巴西特是个赛马老手。他的生活重心就是赛马比赛，而这个小男孩就跟他住在一起。","The uncle was delighted to find that his small nephew was posted with all the racing news.Bassett, the young gardener, who had been wounded in the left foot in the war and got his present job through Oscar Cresswell, whose batman he had been, was a perfect blade of the “turf.” He lived in the racing events, and the small boy lived with him."
"奥斯卡·克雷斯韦尔从巴西特那里明白了一切。","Oscar Cresswell got it all from Bassett."
"“保罗少爷来问我，所以我只能告诉他了，先生。”巴西特说道，他的脸色异乎寻常地严肃，好像在谈论宗教事务。","“Master Paul comes and asks me, so I can’t do more than tell him, sir,” said Bassett, his face terribly serious, as if he were speaking of religious matters."
"“那他对他看好的马下注了吗？”“嗯——我不想泄露他的秘密——他是个年轻的好手，他很棒，先生。要是您不介意，您自己去问他好吗？他从赛马比赛中得到了乐趣，也许他会觉得我在泄露他的秘密，先生，要是您不介意的话。”巴西特神情严肃得像个教堂一样。","“And does he ever put anything on a horse he fancies?” “Well—I don’t want to give him away—he’s a young sport, a fine sport, sir.Would you mind asking him himself?He sort of takes a pleasure in it, and perhaps he’d feel I was giving him away, sir, if you don’t mind.” Bassett was serious as a church."
"舅舅回到他外甥那里，用汽车带他去兜风。","The uncle went back to his nephew, and took him off for a ride in the car."
"“嗨，保罗，我的老朋友，你下过注赌马吗？”舅舅问道。","“Say, Paul, old man, do you ever put anything on a horse?” the uncle asked."
"男孩紧盯着这个英俊的男子。","The boy watched the handsome man closely."
"“怎么，你认为我不应该是吗？”他避而不答。","“Why, do you think I oughtn’t to?” he parried."
"“当然不是！我的意思是，也许你能透露一点和林肯赛马会有关的消息给我。”汽车飞驰着驶进乡下，直向奥斯卡舅舅在汉普郡的住所开过去。","“Not a bit of it!I thought perhaps you might give me a tip for the Lincoln.” The car sped on into the country, going down to Uncle Oscar’s place in Hampshire."
"“以名誉担保吗？”外甥说。","“Honour bright?” said the nephew."
"“孩子，我以名誉担保！”舅舅说道。","“Honour bright, son!” said the uncle."
"“那么，好吧，我说是‘黄水仙’。”“‘黄水仙’！小家伙，我很怀疑。‘米尔泽’怎么样？”“我只知道要赢的马，”男孩说道，“就是‘黄水仙’。”“你确定是‘黄水仙’，嗯？”两人沉默了一会。“黄水仙”相对来说是匹不太引人注意的马。","“Well, then, Daffodil.” “Daffodil!I doubt it, sonny.What about Mirza?” “I only know the winner,” said the boy.“That’s Daffodil.” “Daffodil, eh?” There was a pause.Daffodil was an obscure horse comparatively."
"“舅舅！”“嗯，孩子？”“你不要再告诉别人了，好吗？我跟巴西特保证过。”“该死的巴西特，老家伙！这跟他有什么关系？”“我们是合伙人。我们一开始就合伙了，舅舅，他一开始借给我五先令，我输掉了。我跟他保证过，以名誉担保，这是我和他之间的秘密；只是你给我那十先令以后我才开始赢，所以我觉得你运气很好。你不会再告诉别人了，对吗？”男孩靠得很近的两只大大的蓝眼睛，此刻正热切地盯着他的舅舅。舅舅心里一动，不安地笑了笑。","“Uncle!” “Yes, son?” “You won’t let it go any further, will you?I promised Basset.” “Bassett be damned, old man!What’s he got to do with it?” “We’re partners.We’ve been partners from the first, Uncle, he lent me my first five shillings, which I lost.I promised him, honour bright, it was only between me and him; only you gave me that ten-shilling note I started winning with, so I thought you were lucky.You won’t let it go any further, will you?” The boy gazed at his uncle from those big, hot, blue eyes, set rather close together.The uncle stirred and laughed uneasily."
"“行，孩子！我保守秘密。‘黄水仙’，是吗？你准备在它身上下多少注？”“我准备只留二十磅，其余的都下注，”男孩说，“我留着这二十镑做老本。”舅舅觉得很滑稽。","“Right you are, son!I’ll keep your tip private.Daffodil, eh?How much are you putting on him?” “All except twenty pounds,” said the boy.“I keep that in reserve.” The uncle thought it a good joke."
"“你留下二十镑做老本，是吗，你这个小捣蛋鬼？那你准备押上多少呢？”“我准备押上三百镑。”男孩神情严肃地说，“奥斯卡舅舅，这事可只有你知我知！以名誉担保？”舅舅禁不住大笑起来。","“You keep twenty pounds in reserve, do you, you young romancer?What are you betting, then?” “I’m betting three hundred,” said the boy gravely.“But it’s between you and me, Uncle Oscar!Honour bright?” The uncle burst into a roar of laughter."
"“好，你知我知，你这个小纳特·古尔德。”他笑着说，“可是你那三百镑在哪儿呢？”“巴西特替我保管着。我们是合伙人。”“你们是合伙人，是啊！那巴西特又准备在‘黄水仙’身上押多少钱呢？”“我想他不会像我押那么高。也许他会押一百五吧。”“什么，便士吗？”舅舅笑着问。","“It’s between you and me all right, you young Nat Gould,” he said, laughing.“But where’s your three hundred?” “Bassett keeps it for me.We’re partners.” “You are, are you!And what is Bassett putting on Daffodil?” “He won’t go quite as high as I do, I expect.Perhaps he’ll go a hundred and fifty.” “What, pennies?” laughed the uncle."
"“英镑，”孩子说道，惊奇地瞥了舅舅一眼，“巴西特留下的保本钱比我多多了。”奥斯卡舅舅又吃惊又觉得好笑，他不吭声了。他不想再深究此事了，可他决定带外甥去林肯赛马场。","“Pounds,” said the child, with a surprised look at his uncle.“Bassett keeps a bigger reserve than I do.” Between wonder and amusement Uncle Oscar was silent.He pursued the matter no further, but he determined to take his nephew with him to the Lincoln races."
"“孩子，现在，”他说，“我押二十镑赌‘米尔泽’赢，我替你押五镑赌任意一匹你中意的马赢。你选择哪匹？”","“Now, son,” he said, “I’m putting twenty on Mirza, and I’ll put five for you on any horse you fancy.“What’s your pick?"
"“‘黄水仙’，舅舅！”“不，这五镑不赌‘黄水仙’！”“要是这五镑是我自己的，我就赌。”孩子说。","“Daffodil, uncle.” “No, not the fiver on Daffodil!” “I should if it was my own fiver,” said the child."
"“好！好！你说得对！我五镑，你五镑，押‘黄水仙’。”保罗以前从没有来过赛马场，他的双眼像两团蓝色的火焰。他紧紧抿着嘴，注视着跑马场。坐在他们前面的一个法国人，押的是“兰斯洛特”。他激动得近乎狂野，上下挥动着手臂，用他的法国腔叫喊着“‘兰斯洛特’！‘兰斯洛特’！”","“Good!Good!Right you are!A fiver for me and a fiver for you on Daffodil.” The child had never been to a race-meeting before, and his eyes were blue fire.He pursed his mouth tight, and watched.A Frenchman just in front had put his money on Lancelot.Wild with excitement, he flayed his arms up and down, yelling “@Lancelot! Lancelot!@” in his French accent."
"“黄水仙”冲在第一，“兰斯洛特”第二，“米尔泽”第三。","Daffodil came in first, Lancelot second, Mirza third."
"孩子满脸通红，眼睛闪闪发光，却出奇地平静。他舅舅给他拿来了四张五镑的钞票，赔率是一赔四。","The child, flushed and with eyes blazing, was curiously serene.His uncle brought him four five-pound notes, four to one."
"“我怎么处理这些钱呢？”舅舅在男孩眼前挥舞着这些钱，叫喊道。","“What am I do with these?” he cried, waving them before the boy’s eyes."
"“我觉得我们要去跟巴西特谈谈。”孩子说，“我想现在我有一千五百镑了，再加上二十镑的老本，还要加上手上这二十镑。”舅舅仔细端详了他好一会。","“I suppose we’ll talk to Bassett,” said the boy.“I expect I have fifteen hundred now; and twenty in reserve; and this twenty.” His uncle studied him for some moments."
"“听我说，孩子！”他说道。“你说的关于巴西特和一千五百镑的事情，不是真的，对吧？”不，我说的是真的。不过这事只有你知我知，舅舅。以名誉担保！”“好吧，以名誉担保，孩子！但我必须跟巴西特谈谈。”“要是你愿意跟巴西特和我合作，那我们都可以成为合伙人。只是，舅舅，你必须保证，以名誉担保，不能把这事告诉别人，就只限我们三个人知道。巴西特和我运气很好，你运气肯定也很好，因为我开始赢钱就是用你给的那十先令……”不久后的一个下午，奥斯卡舅舅把巴西特和保罗带到了里士满公园，他们在那儿谈话。","“Look here, son!” he said.“You’re not serious about Bassett and that fifteen hundred, are you?” “Yes, I am.But it’s between you and me, uncle.Honour bright!” “Honour bright all right, son!But I must talk to Bassett.” “If you’d like to be a partner, uncle, with Bassett and me, we could all be partners.Only, you’d have to promise, honour bright, uncle, not to let it go beyond us three.Bassett and I are lucky, and you must be lucky, because it was your ten shillings I started winning with ...” Uncle Oscar took both Bassett and Paul into Richmond Park for an afternoon, and there they talked."
"“您瞧，是这样的，先生。保罗少爷非缠着我，让我给他讲赛马的事情，您知道的，讲故事。而且，他总是十分想知道我到底是赢了还是输了。那大约是一年前的事情了，我替他押了五先令在‘破晓的红霞’身上——结果我们输了。后来，他从您那得到十先令，我们赌了‘僧伽罗人’，接着我们就时来运转了。自那以后，从各方面来看，一直都相当平稳。保罗少爷，你来说说看？”“我们有把握的时候，就必定会赢；”保罗说道，“我们不是那么有把握的时候，就肯定会输。”“哦，但那时候我们都很谨慎。”巴西特说。","“It’s like this, you see, sir, “Master Paul would get me talking about racing events, spinning yarns, you know, sir.And he was always keen on knowing if I’d made or if I’d lost.It’s about a year since, now, that I put five shilling on Blush of Dawn for him—and we lost.Then the luck turned, with that ten shillings he had from you, that we put on Singhalese.And since that time, it’s been pretty steady, all things considering.What do you say, Master Paul?” “We’re all right when we’re sure,” said Paul.“It’s when we’re not quite so sure that we go down.” “Oh, but we’re careful then,” said Bassett."
"“可你们什么时候有把握呢？”奥斯卡舅舅微笑着问道。","“But when are you @sure@?” smiled Uncle Oscar."
"“先生，这取决于保罗少爷。”巴西特说道，声音中充满着神秘和虔诚。“他似乎得到了神谕。比方说，这回林肯赛马会押‘黄水仙’。那简直是手到擒来。”“你押了‘黄水仙’？”奥斯卡·克雷斯韦尔问道。","“It’s Master Paul, sir,” said Bassett in a secret, religious voice.“It’s as if he had it from heaven.Like Daffodil, now, for the Lincoln.That was as sure as eggs.” “Did you put anything on Daffodil?” asked Oscar Cresswell."
"“是的，先生。我赢了。”“那我外甥呢？”巴西特固执地沉默着，望着保罗。","“Yes, sir.I made my bit.” “And my nephew?” Bassett was obstinately silent, looking at Paul."
"“我赢了一千二百镑，是不是，巴西特？我已经告诉过舅舅，我在‘黄水仙’身上押了三百镑。”“对。”巴西特点点头说。","“I made twelve hundred, didn’t I, Basset?I told uncle I was putting three hundred on Daffodil.” “That’s right,” said Bassett, nodding."
"“那钱在哪儿呢？”舅舅问道。","“But where’s the money?” asked the uncle."
"“先生，我把钱好好地锁起来了。保罗少爷任何时候想要，我都可以取出来给他。”“什么，一千五百英镑吗？”“还有二十镑呢！加上他在赛马场上赚到的二十镑的话，就还有四十镑呢！”“太不可思议了！”舅舅说道。","“I keep it safe locked up, sir.Master Paul he can have it any minute he likes to ask for it.” “What, fifteen hundred pounds?” “And twenty!And @forty@, that is, with the twenty he made on the course.” “It’s amazing!” said the uncle."
"“先生，要是保罗少爷让您入伙，恕我冒昧，如果我是您，我会入伙的。”巴西特说。","“If Master Paul offers you to be partners, sir, I would, if I were you; if you’ll excuse me,” said Bassett."
"奥斯卡·克雷斯韦尔考虑了一下。","Oscar Cresswell thought about it."
"“我要看看钱。”他说道。","“I’ll see the money,” he said."
"他们又开车回家。果然，巴西特绕到花园里的小屋，拿出了一共一千五百镑的钞票。","They drove home again, and sure enough, Bassett came round to the garden-house with fifteen hundred pounds in notes."
"保本的二十镑存在赛马场托管储蓄所的乔·格雷那里。","The twenty pounds reserve was left with Joe Glee, in the Turf Commission deposit."
"“舅舅，你看，我有把握的时候都是对的！我们现在有这么多钱，接下来钱还会越来越多。巴西特，是不是？”“是这样，保罗少爷。”“那你什么时候有把握呢？”舅舅笑着问道。","“You see, it’s all right, uncle, when I’m @sure@!Then we go strong, for all we’re worth.Don’t we Bassett?” “We do that, Master Paul.” “And when are you sure?” said the uncle, laughing."
"“哦，是这样的，有的时候我有绝对的把握，比方说赌‘黄水仙’的时候；”孩子说，“有的时侯我仅仅有个想法，还有的时候我连个想法也没有，是不是，巴西特？那时我们会很谨慎，因为多半会输。”“是这样的，是的！那当你有把握的时候，就像赌‘黄水仙’时，是什么使你觉得有把握呢，孩子？”“哦，嗯，我不知道。”男孩不安地说道，“舅舅，你知道，我就是有把握，就是这样。”“他像得到了神谕一样，先生。”巴西特重申道。","“Oh, well, sometimes I’m @absolutely@ sure, like about Daffodil,” said the boy; “and sometimes I have an idea; and sometime I haven’t even an idea, have I, Basset?Then we’re careful, because we mostly go down.” “You do, do you!And when you’re sure, like about Daffodil, what makes you sure, sonny?” “Oh, well, I don’t know,” said the boy uneasily.“I’m sure, you know, uncle; that’s all.” “It’s as if he had it from heaven, sir,” Bassett reiterated."
"“我也认为是这样！”舅舅说。","“I should say so!” said his uncle."
"舅舅成了合伙人。在里格赛马会举办之际，保罗对一匹叫“跳跃的火花”的马“很有把握”，这是一匹很微不足道的马。孩子坚持押了一千镑赌这匹马胜，巴西特押了五百镑，而奥斯卡·克雷斯韦尔押了两百镑。结果，“跳跃的火花”跑了第一，赔率为一赔十，保罗赢了一万英镑。","But he became a partner.And when the Leger was coming on, Paul was “sure” about Lively Spark, which was a quite inconsiderable horse.The boy insisted on putting a thousand on the horse, Bassett went for five hundred, and Oscar Cresswell two hundred.Lively Spark came in first, and the betting had been ten to one against him, Paul had made ten thousand."
"“你看，”他说，“我对它完全有把握。”甚至奥斯卡·克雷斯韦尔也净赚了两千镑。","“You see,” he said, “I was absolutely sure of him.” Even Oscar Cresswell had cleared two thousand."
"“孩子，你看看，”他说，“这种事让我紧张不安。”“用不着的，舅舅！也许要再过很长时间我才能再次有把握。”“那你打算怎么处理这些钱？”舅舅问道。","“Look here, son,” he said, “this sort of thing makes me nervous.” “It needn’t, uncle!Perhaps I shan’t be sure again for a long time.” “But what are you going to do with your money?” asked the uncle."
"“我当然有打算，”孩子说，“我是为妈妈才开始赌的。她说因为爸爸不走运，她运气也不好，所以我想要是我走运，它也许会停止低语。”“什么也许会停止低语？”“我们的房子。我恨我家房子的低语声。”“它低语些什么？”“唉——唉，”——孩子烦躁起来——“唉，我不知道。总是关于缺钱之类的，舅舅，你知道的。”“我知道，孩子，我知道的。”“你知道人们寄给妈妈一大堆账单，是吧，舅舅？”“恐怕是这样。”舅舅说。","“Of course,” said the boy, “I started it for mother.She said she had no luck, because father is unlucky, so I thought if I was lucky, it might stop whispering.” “What might stop whispering?” “Our house.I @hate@ our house for whispering.” “What does it whisper?” “Why—why”—the boy fidgeted—“why, I don’t know.But it’s always short of money, you know, uncle.” “I know it son, I know it.” “You know people send mother writs, don’t you, uncle?” “I’m afraid I do,” said the uncle."
"“然后这房子喃喃低语，就像人们在背后嘲笑你一样。太可怕了，真的！我想要是我走运……”“你也许能阻止它。”舅舅接着说。","“And then the house whispers, like people laughing at you behind your back.It’s awful, that is!I thought if I was lucky ...” “You might stop it,” added the uncle."
"孩子用大大的蓝眼睛注视着他，一言不发，眼里燃烧着一团神秘的冷冷的火焰。","The boy watched him with big blue eyes, that had an uncanny cold fire in them, and he said never a word."
"“那么，好吧！”舅舅说道，“我们怎么做呢？”“我不想让妈妈知道我运气好。”孩子说。","“Well, then!” said the uncle.“What are we doing?” “I shouldn’t like mother to know I was lucky,” said the boy."
"“这是为什么呢，孩子？”“她会阻止我的。”“我想她不会。”“噢！”——孩子古怪地扭动着身体——“舅舅，我就是不想让她知道。”“好的，孩子！我们想个办法不让她知道。”这一点他们很容易就做到了。在舅舅的建议下，保罗把五千英镑交给了他，舅舅把这笔钱存在家庭律师那里，然后由律师通知保罗的妈妈，说有一位亲戚把五千镑放在他那里，在以后五年间每逢她生日那天，她便可支取一千镑。","“Why not, son?” “She’d stop me.” “I don’t think she would.” “Oh!”—and the boy writhed in and odd way—“I @don’t@ want her to know, uncle.” “All right, son!We’ll manage it without her knowing.” They managed it very easily.Paul, at the other’s suggestion, handed over five thousand pounds to his uncle, who deposited it with the family lawyer, who was then to inform Paul’s mother that a relative had put five thousand pounds into his hands, which sum was to be paid out a thousand pounds at a time, on the mother’s birthday, for the next five years."
"“连续五年，她每年都会得到一千镑作生日礼物，”奥斯卡舅舅说，“我希望这不会让她以后变本加厉。”保罗的妈妈十一月过生日。最近一段时间，这房子的低语比以往更严重了，尽管保罗运气好，他也实在忍受不了了。他非常渴望看见妈妈收到获赠一千镑的生日贺信后，会有什么反应。","“So she’ll have a birthday present of a thousand pounds for five successive years,” said Uncle Oscar.“I hope it won’t make it all the harder for her later.” Paul’s mother had her birthday in November.“The house had been “whispering” worse that ever lately, and, even in spite of his luck, Paul could not bear up against it.He was very anxious to see the effect of the birthday letter, telling his mother about the thousand pounds."
"因为保罗现在已经不用呆在儿童室，所以在没有客人的时候，他便跟父母一起用餐。他妈妈几乎每天都进城。她发现自己有速写毛皮衣饰的特殊技能，所以她私下里在一个朋友的工作室工作，这个朋友是大布商的首席“艺术家”。她画一些穿着裘皮大衣的女士，还有身着缀满金片的丝绸服饰的女士，发在报纸上做广告。这位年轻的女艺术家一年收入几千英镑，但保罗的妈妈却只能挣到几百镑，因此她又不满意了。她十分渴望能在某个领域领先于别人，可她并没有做到，甚至在为服装广告画速写这方面也没能领先。","When there were no visitors, Paul now took his meals with his parents, as he was beyond the nursery control.His mother went into town nearly every day.She had discovered that she had an odd knack of sketching furs and dress materials, so she worked secretly in the studio of a friend who was the chief “artist” for the leading drapers.She drew the figures of ladies in furs and ladies in silk and sequins for the newspaper advertisements.This young woman artist earned several thousand pounds a year, but Paul’s mother only made several hundred, and she was again dissatisfied.She so wanted to be first in something, and she did not succeed, even in making sketches for drapery advertisements."
"生日的那天早晨，她下楼来吃早饭。母亲读信的时候，保罗在一旁观察着她。他知道那是律师的信。母亲一边读着，脸色沉了下来，变得更加面无表情。接下来，她嘴角露出了一种冷漠而坚决的表情。她把信藏在一堆信的底下，对此一言未发。","She was down to breakfast on the morning of her birthday.Paul watched her face as she read her letters.He knew the lawyer’s letter.As his mother read it, her face hardened and became more expressionless.Then a cold, determined look came on her mouth.She hid the letter under the pile of others, and said not a word about it."
"“妈妈，在那些生日贺信里没有什么好消息吗？”保罗问道。","“Didn’t you have anything nice in the post for your birthday, mother?” said Paul."
"“都挺好的。”她漠然而又心不在焉地说道。","“Quite moderately nice,” she said, her voice cold and absent."
"她没再说什么，起身进城去了。但是那天下午，奥斯卡舅舅来了。他说保罗的妈妈跟律师进行了一次长谈，问五千镑可否一次性全部支取，因为她现在负债累累。","She went away to town without saying more.But in the afternoon Uncle Oscar appeared.He said Paul’s mother had had a long interview with the lawyer, asking if the whole five thousand could not be advanced at once, as she was in debt."
"“舅舅，你认为如何？”孩子问道。","“What do you think, uncle?” said the boy."
"“孩子，你决定吧。”“哦，那就让她拿吧！我们用另外的本钱，还可以挣更多钱。”男孩说。","“I leave it to you, son.” “Oh, let her have it, then!We can get some more with the other,” said the boy."
"“小伙子，‘一鸟在手，胜似二鸟在林’啊！”奥斯卡舅舅说道。","“A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, laddie!” said Uncle Oscar."
"“但是我对英国大赛马会很有把握，或者是林肯郡赛马会，要不就是德比赛马会。它们中至少有一个，我是有把握的。”保罗说道。","“But I’m sure to @know@ for the Grand National; or the Lincolnshire; or else the Derby.I’m sure to know for @one@ of them,” said Paul."
"于是奥斯卡舅舅和保罗的妈妈签订了协议，保罗的妈妈触碰到了整整五千镑。接下来，一些十分离奇古怪的事情发生了。房子里发出的声音突然变得疯狂起来，像春日傍晚时分青蛙的合唱。家里有了一些新家具，保罗也有了位家庭教师。来年秋天，他将真正地进伊顿公学念书了，那是他爸爸的母校。冬天，家里也摆着鲜花，保罗的妈妈向来都习惯于奢华的生活。然而，从含羞草的细小花枝后面，从朵朵杏花后面，从彩虹色的漂亮坐垫下面，房子简直是在狂喜地用颤音尖叫：“必须要有更多钱！噢——噢——噢；必须要有更多钱！噢，现在，现在——现在！现在——现在——现在——必须要有更多钱！——比以前更多！比以前更多！”这真把保罗吓坏了。他跟着家庭教师学习拉丁语、希腊语。而跟巴西特一起，度过紧张激烈的时间。英国大赛马会已经举办过了：他还没“知道”，并且输了一百镑。暑期即将到来。他极度痛苦地等待着林肯赛马会的举办。可即使是林肯赛马会，他也不“知道”，于是又赔了五十镑。他的眼神变得疯狂，举止变得怪异，似乎心里有什么东西要爆炸了。","So Uncle Oscar signed the agreement, and Paul’s mother touched the whole five thousand.Then something very curious happened.The voices in the house suddenly went mad, like a chorus of frogs on a spring evening.There were certain new furnishings, and Paul had a tutor.He was @really@ going to Eton, his father’s school, in the following autumn.There were flowers in the winter, and a blossoming of the luxury Paul’s mother had been used to.And yet the voices in the house, behind the sprays of mimosa and almond blossom, and from under the piles of iridescent cushions, simply trilled and screamed in a sort of ecstasy: “There @must@ be more money!Oh-h-h; there @must@ be more money.Oh, now, now-w!Now-w-w—there @must@ be more money!—more than ever! More than ever!” It frightened Paul terribly.He studied away at his Latin and Greek with his tutors.But his intense hours were spent with Bassett.The Grand National had gone by: he had not “known,” and had lost a hundred pounds.Summer was at hand.He was in agony for the Lincoln.But even for the Lincoln he didn’t “know,” and he lost fifty pounds.He became wild-eyed and strange, as if something were going to explode in him."
"“别管它了，孩子！别操心这事了！”奥斯卡舅舅极力劝道。但是这孩子似乎根本听不见舅舅的劝说。","“Let it alone, son!Don’t you bother about it!” urged Uncle Oscar.But it was as if the boy couldn’t really hear what his uncle was saying."
"“我必须知道德比赛马会！我必须知道德比赛马会！”孩子重复道，他大大的蓝眼睛里燃烧着一种疯狂。","“I’ve got to know for the Derby!I’ve got to know for the Derby!” the child reiterated, his big blue eyes blazing with a sort of madness."
"妈妈注意到了孩子的过度紧张。","His mother noticed how overwrought he was."
"“你最好去海滨玩玩。难道你不愿意停止空等，现在就去海滨吗？我觉得你还是应该去海滨玩玩。”她说着，不安地低头看着他，心情因他而异常沉重。","“You’d better go the seaside.Wouldn’t you like to go now to the seaside, instead of waiting?I think you’d better,” she said, looking down at him anxiously, her heart curiously heavy because of him."
"但是男孩扬起那眼神怪异的蓝眼睛。","But the child lifted his uncanny blue eyes."
"“德比赛马会之前我没法去，妈妈！”他说道。“我没法去！”“为什么没法去？”她说道，遇到孩子的反对时，她的声音变得阴沉严肃。“为什么没法去？要是你愿意，你也可以从海滨出发，跟奥斯卡舅舅去看德比赛马会。你根本没必要在这儿等。另外，我觉得你对赛马会关心得有点过头了。这可是个坏兆头。我的家族曾经热衷于赌博，你只有长大后才会知道赌博有多大的危害。但那时已经于事无补了。我得把巴西特送走了，除非你能在赛马这件事上保持理智，不然我就让奥斯卡舅舅再也不跟你说赛马的事了；到海滨去，忘了这事吧。你太紧张了！”“妈妈，你叫我做什么我就做什么，只要你不在德比赛马会之前把我送走。”孩子说道。","“I couldn’t possibly go before the Derby, mother!” he said.“I couldn’t possibly!” “Why not?” she said, her voice becoming heavy when she was opposed.“Why not?You can still go from the seaside to see the Derby with your Uncle Oscar, if that’s what you wish.No need for you to wait here.Besides, I think you care too much about these races.It’s a bad sign.My family has been a gambling family, and you won’t know till you grow up how much damage it has done.But it has done damage.I shall have to send Bassett away, and ask Uncle Oscar not to talk racing to you unless you promise to be reasonable about it; go away to the seaside and forget it.You’re all nerves!” “I’ll do what you like, mother, so long as you don’t send me away till after the Derby,” the boy said."
"“从哪儿把你送走？就从这栋房子吗？”“是的。”他说道，凝视着她。","“Send you away from where?Just from this house?” “Yes,” he said gazing at her."
"“哎呀，你这怪孩子，是什么让你突然这么关注这个房子？我从来不知道你爱它。”他盯着她，一言不发。他暗地里有个秘密，这个秘密他从来没透露给别人过，甚至连巴西特或是奥斯卡舅舅他也没告诉。","“Why, you curious child, what makes you care about this house so much, suddenly?I never knew you loved it.” He gazed at her without speaking.He had a secret within a secret, something he had not divulged, even to Bassett or to his Uncle Oscar."
"然而他妈妈犹豫不决地在原地站了一会，稍稍愠怒了片刻，张口说道：“那么好吧！要是你不愿意，那就在德比赛马会之后再去海滨吧。不过你得答应我，别把自己弄得神经兮兮的！答应我，别老是想着你所谓的赛马大事！”“噢，不会的！”男孩随口说道。“我不会老想着的，妈妈。你不用担心。妈妈，我要是你的话就不会担心。”“要是你是我，而我是你，”妈妈说道，“我在想我们应该怎么办！”“但你知道你不必担心，对吧，妈妈？”男孩重复着。","But his mother, after standing undecided and a little bit sullen for some moments, said: “Very well, then!Don’t go to the seaside till after the Derby, if you don’t wish it.But promise me you won’t let your nerves go to pieces.Promise you won’t think so much about horse-racing and @events@, as you call them!” “Oh, no,” said the boy casually.“I won’t think much about them, mother.You needn’t worry.I wouldn’t worry, mother, if I were you.” “If you were me and I were you,” said his mother, “I wonder what we @should@ do!” “But you know you needn’t worry, mother, don’t you?” the boy repeated."
"“如果真是这样，我该是十分高兴地知道这一点。”她疲倦地说道。","“I should be awfully glad to know it,” she said wearily."
"“噢，嗯，你能的，你知道。我说的是，你应该知道你用不着担心！”他强调道。","“Oh, well, you @can@, you know.I mean, you @ought@ to know you needn’t worry,” he insisted."
"“是吗？那就走着瞧吧。”她说。","“Ought I?Then I’ll see about it,” she said."
"保罗秘密中的秘密就是他的木马，那匹没有名字的木马。自从他摆脱了保姆的管教，也不用一直呆在儿童室以来，他就把木马搬到了楼顶自己的卧室里。","Paul’s secret of secrets was his wooden horse, that which had no name.Since he was emancipated from a nurse and a nursery-governess, he had had his rocking-horse removed to his own bedroom at the top of the house."
"“你无疑已经过了骑木马的年龄了！”妈妈曾规劝过他。","“Surely, you’re too big for a rocking-horse!” his mother had remonstrated."
"“嗯，你瞧，妈妈，在我能有匹真马之前，我喜欢周围有些动物。”他曾经这样巧妙地回答道。","“Well, you see, mother, till I can have a @real@ horse, I like to have @some@ sort of animal about.” Had been his quaint answer."
"“你觉得它在陪着你吗？”她笑了。","“Do you feel he keeps you company?” she laughed."
"“噢，是的！它特别好，我在房间里的时候，它总是跟我作伴。”保罗说道。","“Oh, yes!He’s very good, he always keeps me company, when I’m there,” said Paul."
"就这样，这匹相当破旧的木马依然以一副腾跃的姿态，静立在孩子的卧室里。","So the horse, rather shabby, stood in an arrested prance in the boy’s bedroom."
"德比赛马会快到了，男孩变得越来越紧张。别人对他说什么他几乎都听不见，他很虚弱，眼睛里流露出十分怪异的神情。妈妈突然在他身上捕捉到一种莫名其妙的不安。有时候，她会突然为孩子感到忧虑，心中极度悲痛，而这种悲痛要持续半小时左右。她想马上冲到他跟前，确定他是健康平安的。","The Derby was drawing near, and the boy grew more and more tense.He hardly heard what was spoken to him, he was very frail, and his eyes were really uncanny.His mother had sudden strange seizures of uneasiness about him.Sometimes, for half-an-hour, she would feel a sudden anxiety about him that was almost anguish.She wanted to rush to him at once, and know he was safe."
"德比赛马会之前两天的晚上，她正在城里参加一个盛大的晚会，就在这时，一股对她儿子、对她这个头胎孩子的焦虑之情涌上心头，攫住了她的心脏，使她几乎无法开口说话。她竭尽全力与这种感觉斗争，因为她相信自己天生的判断力。但是这感觉太强烈了。她只得离开舞场，下楼往乡下打电话。孩子们的保育员十分吃惊，她被这深夜里的电话铃声吓了一大跳。","Two nights before the Derby, she was at a big party in town, when one of her rushes of anxiety about her boy, her first-born, gripped her heart till she could hardly speak.She fought with the feeling, might and main, for she believed in common-sense.But it was too strong.She had to leave the dance and go downstairs to telephone to the country.The children’s nursery-governess was terribly surprised and startled at being rung up in the night."
"“威尔莫特小姐，孩子们都还好吧？”“噢，是的，他们都很好。”“那保罗少爷呢，他没事吧？”“他准时上床睡觉了。需要我上去看看他吗？”“不用了。”保罗的妈妈有些勉强地说。“不！不用麻烦了。就这样吧。你不用等我们。我们很快就回家。”她不想让别人贸然闯入儿子的私密空间。","“Are the children all right, Miss Wilmot?” “Oh, yes, they are quite all right.” “Master Paul?Is he all right?” “He went to bed as right as a trivet.Shall I run up and look at him?” “No,” said Paul’s mother reluctantly.“No!Don’t trouble.It’s all right.Don’t sit up.We shall be home fairly soon.” She did not want her son’s privacy intruded upon."
"“好的。”保育员说。","“Very good,” said the governess."
"保罗的爸爸妈妈开车回到家里时，已经大约是夜里一点钟了。房里一片沉寂。保罗的妈妈回到自己的房间，脱下白色的裘皮大衣。她已告诉佣人不用等她了。她听到丈夫在楼下，正在往威士忌酒里兑苏打水。","It was about one o’clock when Paul’s mother and father drove up to their house.All was still.Paul’s mother went to her room and slipped off her white fur cloak.She had told her maid not to wait up for her.She heard her husband downstairs, mixing a whisky-and-soda."
"这时，出于内心里奇怪的焦虑，她悄悄走上楼往儿子的房间走去。她轻轻地沿着顶楼走廊走着。像是有种微弱的声音传来。那是什么声音？","And then, because of the strange anxiety at her heart, she stole upstairs to her son’s room.Noiselessly she went along the upper corridor.Was there a faint noise?What was it?"
"她站在门外倾听着，浑身肌肉绷得紧紧的。屋里有种奇怪的、沉重的、却又不怎么响的声音。她屏气凝神。那是一种寂静的喧哗声，尽管无声却十分活跃，且很有力量。一些巨大的东西，正在疯狂而静默地动作着。那是什么？上帝啊，那到底是什么？她应该知道。她觉得自己了解那声音。　她知道那是什么。","She stood, with arrested muscles, outside his door, listening.There was a strange, heavy, and yet not loud noise.Her heart stood still.It was a soundless noise, yet rushing and powerful.Something huge, in violent, hushed motion.What was it?What in God’s name was it?She ought to know.She felt that she knew the noise.She knew what it was."
"然而她却想不起来。她说不清那到底是什么。那声音不停地响啊响，像疯了一样。","Yet she could not place it.She couldn’t say what it was.And on and on it went, like a madness."
"她万分恐惧焦虑，简直被吓呆了，她轻轻地转动着门把手。","Softly, frozen with anxiety and fear, she turned the door-handle."
"房间里一片漆黑。然而在靠近窗户的地方，她听见也看见了什么东西正在来回猛冲。她恐惧而惊诧地凝视着。","The room was dark.Yet in the space near the window, she heard and saw something plunging to and fro.She gazed in fear and amazement."
"她突然拧开灯，看见她儿子穿着绿色的睡衣，骑着木马疯狂地奔腾驰骋着。强烈的灯光突然照亮了在木马上猛冲的孩子，也照亮了她，她有着金色的头发，白皙的皮肤，身着浅绿色饰有水晶的礼服，站在门边。","Then suddenly she switched on the light, and saw her son, in his green pyjamas, madly surging on the rocking-horse.The blaze of light suddenly lit him up, as he urged the wooden horse, and lit her up, as she stood, blonde, in her dress of pale green and crystal, in the doorway."
"“保罗！”她喊道，“你究竟在干什么？”“是‘马拉巴尔’！”他尖叫道，声音有力而怪异，“是‘马拉巴尔’！”他不再驱策木马，有那么奇妙而无意识的一秒钟，他神采奕奕地盯着她。然后“砰”地一声，他倒在了地板上。她备受折磨的母爱一下全涌上心头，连忙猛冲过去,扶起了孩子。","“Paul!” she cried.“Whatever are you doing?” “It’s Malabar!” he screamed, in a powerful, strange voice.“It’s Malabar!” His eyes blazed at her for one strange and senseless second, as he ceased urging his wooden horse.Then he fell with a crash to the ground, and she, all her tormented motherhood flooding upon her, rushed to gather him up."
"可他失去知觉了，一直神志不清，他患上了轻度的脑膜炎。他喃喃自语，翻来覆去，他妈妈则面无表情地坐在他身边。","But he was unconscious, and unconscious he remained, with some brain-fever.He talked and tossed, and his mother sat stonily by his side."
"“‘马拉巴尔’！是‘马拉巴尔’！巴西特，巴西特，我知道了！是‘马拉巴尔’！”孩子就这样叫喊着，试图站起来去驱策那匹给他灵感的木马。","“Malabar!It’s Malabar!Bassett, Bassett, I know!It’s Malabar!” So the child cried, trying to get up and urge the rocking-horse that gave him his inspiration."
"“他说的‘马拉巴尔’是什么意思？”心寒的母亲问道。","“What does he mean by Malabar?” asked the heart-frozen mother."
"“我不知道。”父亲漠然地应答。","“I don’t know,” said the father stonily."
"“‘马拉巴尔’是什么意思？”她问她兄弟奥斯卡。","“What does he mean by Malabar?” she asked her brother Oscar."
"“那是德比赛马会上的一匹赛马。”舅舅是这样回答的。","“It’s one of the horses running for the Derby,” was the answer."
"之后，奥斯卡·克雷斯韦尔不由自主地向巴西特透露了这一消息，他自己押了一千镑赌“马拉巴尔”胜，赔率是一赔十四。","And, in spite of himself, Oscar Cresswell spoke to Basset, and himself put a thousand on Malabar: at fourteen to one."
"第三天保罗的病情变得十分严重；他们期待着转机。男孩在枕头上不停地翻来覆去，他那头长长的卷发也跟着不停地摆动。他既没有睡着，也没有恢复知觉，眼睛像蓝色的宝石。他的妈妈坐在一边，觉得内心空空如也，好像真的变成了一块石头。","The third day of the illness was critical: they were waiting for a change.The boy, with his rather long, curly hair, was tossing ceaselessly on the pillow.He neither slept nor regained consciousness, and his eyes were like blue stones.His mother sat, feeling her heart had gone, turned actually into a stone."
"晚上，奥斯卡·克雷斯韦尔没有来，但是巴西特送了个口信，问他能否上来一会，就一会。保罗的妈妈对他的打搅很生气，但转念一想又同意了。孩子还是老样子。或许巴西特会让他恢复知觉。","In the evening, Oscar Cresswell did not come, but Bassett sent a message, saying could he come up for one moment, just one moment?Paul’s mother was very angry at the intrusion, but on second thought she agreed.The boy was the same.Perhaps Bassett might bring him to consciousness."
"园丁巴西特个子不高，留着一小撮褐色的小胡子，同是褐色的小眼睛透着精明。他蹑手蹑脚地走进房间，向保罗的妈妈碰了下想象中的帽子，然后悄悄走到了床边，闪闪发亮的小眼睛紧盯着辗转反侧的垂死的孩子。　","The gardener, a shortish fellow with a little brown moustache, and sharp little brown eyes, tiptoes into the room, touched his imaginary cap to Paul’s mother, and stole to the bedside, staring with glittering, smallish eyes, at the tossing, dying child."
"“保罗少爷！”他小声说道。“保罗少爷！‘马拉巴尔’真的跑了第一，大获全胜。我照你说的办了。你赢了七万多镑，真的；全部加起来你有八万多镑了。‘马拉巴尔’跑得很好，保罗少爷。”“‘马拉巴尔’！‘马拉巴尔’！我说是‘马拉巴尔’吧，妈妈？我说是‘马拉巴尔’吧？你觉得我走运吗，妈妈？我就知道是‘马拉巴尔’，对不对？八万多镑！这就叫走运，你不觉得吗，妈妈？八万多镑！我就知道，难道我不清楚我知道？‘马拉巴尔’跑得很棒。要是我骑着我的马直到我确定了，那我告诉你，巴西特，你能押多高就押多高。你把所有财产都押上了吗，巴西特？”“我押了一千镑，保罗少爷。”“妈妈，我从来没告诉过你，要是我能骑着我的马到达那里，我就完全有把握——噢，完全有！　妈妈，我告诉过你吗？我很走运！”“没有，从来没有。”母亲说道。","“Master Paul!” he whispered.“Master Paul!Malabar came in first all right, a clean win.I did as you told me.You’ve made over seventy thousand pounds, you have; you’ve got over eighty thousand.Malabar came in all right, Master Paul.” “Malabar!Malabar!Did I say Malabar, mother?Did I say Malabar?Do you think I’m lucky, mother?I knew Malabar, didn’t I?Over eighty thousand pounds!I call that lucky, don’t you, mother?Over eighty thousand pounds!I knew, didn’t I know I knew?Malabar came in all right.If I ride my horse till I’m sure, then I tell you, Bassett, you can go as high as you like.Did you go for all you were worth, Bassett?” I went a thousand on it, Master Paul.” “I never told you, mother, that if I can ride my horse, and @get there@, then I’m absolutely sure—oh, absolutely!Mother, did I ever tell you?I @am@ lucky!” “No, you never did,” said the mother."
"然而,男孩在夜里死去了。","But the boy died in the night."
"正当他躺着死去时，他妈妈听见她兄弟对她说：“上帝啊，赫丝特，好事是你赚了八万镑，坏事是不幸地损失了一个儿子。可是，可怜的小家伙，可怜的小家伙，他最好还是别再过这种骑着木马寻找胜者的日子了。”","And even as he lay dead, his mother heard her brother’s voice saying to her: “My God, Hester, you’re eighty-thousand to the good, and a poor devil of a son to the bad.But, poor devil, poor devil, he’s best gone out of a life where he rides his rocking-horse to find a winner."
