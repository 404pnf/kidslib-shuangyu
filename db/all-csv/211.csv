"第一章法律、秩序和克制在弗雷德里克·特拉弗斯的脸上留下了深深的刻痕。这张有力而坚定的脸曾习惯了权力，他过去就是凭借他的智慧和判断力来运用权力的。正派的生活让他拥有健康的肌肤，就连肌肤上的纹理也都是诚实的曲线。辛苦而专注的工作留下了健康的杰作，这就是全部。这个男人身上的每一个特点，从碧蓝色的眼睛到浓密的头发——他的头发呈浅棕色，中间夹杂着白发，头发顺滑地向两边分开，在隆起的额头上方划出一条直线——都讲述着一个相同的故事。他是一个很讲究打扮的人，而且这套淡色夏款西装只是映衬了他多年来的机警，并没有高调地表明，它的主人也是一个拥有数不清财产的人。","ILaw, order, and restraint had carved Frederick Travers’ face.It was the strong, firm face of one used to power and who had used power with wisdom and discretion.Clean living had made the healthy skin, and the lines graved in it were honest lines.Hard and devoted work had left its wholesome handiwork, that was all.Every feature of the man told the same story, from the clear blue of the eyes to the full head of hair, light brown, touched with grey, and smoothly parted and drawn straight across above the strong-domed forehead.He was a seriously groomed man, and the light summer business suit no more than befitted his alert years, while it did not shout aloud that its possessor was likewise the possessor of numerous millions of dollars and property."
