"第一幕","ACT I"
"第一场——瓦莱尔，埃莉斯。","SCENE I.——VALÈRE, ÉLISE."
"瓦莱尔怎么了，亲爱的埃莉斯？你真心地与我许诺终生后，怎会这样忧伤？在我快乐的时候，你却在唉声叹气！你难道后悔让我感到幸福？还是后悔我逼得你答应我的求婚？","Val.What, dear Élise! you grow sad after having given me such dear tokens of your love; and I see you sigh in the midst of my joy!Can you regret having made me happy? and do you repent of the engagement which my love has forced from you?"
"埃莉斯不，瓦莱尔，我不后悔我为你做的一切，有一股十分愉快的力量促使我这样做，我甚至不希望这件事还有别的可能性。可是，说实话，这事情的结果令我担忧，而且我害怕我爱你爱得有点过分。","Eli.No, Valère, I do not regret what I do for you; I feel carried on by too delightful a power, and I do not even wish that things should be otherwise than they are. Yet, to tell you the truth, I am very anxious about the consequences; and I greatly fear that I love you more than I should."
"瓦莱尔你对我一片深情，这有什么好怕的？","Val.What can you possibly fear from the affection you have shown me?"
"埃莉斯怕这一切——怕我父亲生气，怕家人指责，怕众人说三道四。尤其最让我害怕的，瓦莱尔，便是你变心！我怕当女孩子表达出她纯真的爱意后，你们男人会残酷又冷漠地回应她。","Eli.Everything; the anger of my father, the reproaches of my family, the censure of the world, and, above all, Valère, a change in your heart!I fear that cruel coldness with which your sex so often repays the too warm proofs of an innocent love."
"瓦莱尔啊！不要误解我，把我看作和别的男人一样。你怎样想我都行，埃莉斯，可我绝不会辜负你。我太爱你了，我对你的爱永不改变！","Val.Alas! do not wrong me thus; do not judge of me by others. Think me capable of everything, Élise, except of falling short of what I owe to you. I love you too much for that; and my love will be as lasting as my life!"
"埃莉斯啊！瓦莱尔，每个男人都这么说，所有男人说的话都一样，而只有通过行动，才能看出他们的不同。","Eli. Ah!Valère, all men say the same thing; all men are alike in their words; their actions only show the difference that exists between them."
"瓦莱尔那么你为何不等一等，让我用实际行动来表明我的心迹？不要让不恰当的担忧误导了你，认为我有罪。不要让过度敏感的猜忌毁掉了我看得比生命还要重的幸福。给我点时间，我会无数次地向你证明我真挚的情感。","Val.Then why not wait for actions, if by them alone you can judge of the truthfulness of my heart?Do not suffer your anxious fears to mislead you, and to wrong me. Do not let an unjust suspicion destroy the happiness which is to me dearer than life; but give me time to show you by a thousand proofs the sincerity of my affection."
"埃莉斯唉！每当这时，人们都很容易相信自己所爱的人。我信任你，瓦莱尔，我相信你的心不会欺骗我，你是真心爱我，并永远忠于我。幸福近在咫尺，我不再怀疑了。如果我难过，那只是担心我们的艰难处境，还有其他人的责难。","Eli.Alas! how easily do we allow ourselves to be persuaded by those we love. I believe you, Valère; I feel sure that your heart is utterly incapable of deceiving me, that your love is sincere, and that you will ever remain faithful to me.I will no longer doubt that happiness is near.If I grieve, it will only be over the difficulties of our position, and the possible censures of the world."
"瓦莱尔可干吗要担心这个？","Val.But why even this fear?"
"埃莉斯哦，瓦莱尔！如果所有人都像我一样了解你的话，我就没什么好担心了。我为你所做的一切，都能在你身上找到充分的理由。我的心知道你所有的好，而且我怀揣感激，一定要和你在一起。我怎会忘记我们第一次见面时的危难情景？你冒着生命危险，勇敢地把我从急流中救出来。将我救出之后，你又给我无微不至的关怀。你那持久的、像烈火一般的爱情，绝不会因为时间或者困难而减弱！为了我，你不顾自己的亲人和祖国，放弃自己的真实身份，甘愿做我父亲的仆人！我怎能对你为我所做的一切无动于衷？难道这不足以证明我对你的承诺是正确的吗？然而，别人是不是也这样认为呢？我又如何肯定别人能够了解我的感情呢？","Eli.Oh, Valère! if everybody knew you as I do, I should not have much to fear.I find in you enough to justify all I do for you; my heart knows all your merit, and feels, moreover, bound to you by deep gratitude. How can I forget that horrible moment when we met for the first time?Your generous courage in risking your own life to save mine from the fury of the waves; your tender care afterwards; your constant attentions and your ardent love, which neither time nor difficulties can lessen!For me you neglect your parents and your country; you give up your own position in life to be a servant of my father!How can I resist the influence that all this has over me?Is it not enough to justify in my eyes my engagement to you?Yet, who knows if it will be enough to justify it in the eyes of others?and how can I feel sure that my motives will be understood?"
"瓦莱尔你徒劳地寻找着我这样做的价值，可是我认为是我的真爱，才值得你去提起。你父亲的本质就足以让大家明白你的担忧是有道理的。因为他过于贪婪，对自己的子女也很疏远，所以发生了再奇怪的事情也不算过分。亲爱的埃莉斯，请原谅我，在你面前这样评论你的父亲，可是很不幸，你也知道的，一提起你的父亲，我实在说不出什么好听的话来。不过，倘若我能如愿以偿地找回我的父母，他们会很快接受我们的。我迫不及待地等待着他们的消息，假如还是杳无音信的话，我就要亲自去找。","Val.You try in vain to find merit in what I have done; it is by my love alone that I trust to deserve you. As for the scruples you feel, your father himself justifies you but too much before the world; and his avarice and the distant way in which he lives with his children might authorise stranger things still. Forgive me, my dear Élise, for speaking thus of your father before you; but you know that, unfortunately, on this subject no good can be said of him. However, if I can find my parents, as I fully hope I shall, they will soon be favourable to us.I am expecting news of them with great impatience; but if none comes I will go in search of them myself."
"埃莉斯哦不！瓦莱尔，你不要走，求求你。你要想办法得到我父亲的欢心。","Eli.Oh no!Valère, do not leave me, I entreat you. Try rather to ingratiate yourself in my father’s favour."
"瓦莱尔你知道我有多么想得到你父亲的欢心，你也看到了我付出的努力。为了给他当仆人，我已经费尽了心机对他阿谀奉承。为了得到他的赏识，我要隐藏自己的真实情感，极力地装出赞同他、迎合他的样子。为了获取他的宠爱，我要扮演怎样一个角色，这些你都应该看到了。在这方面，我取得了惊人的进步，而且我总结出要讨好一个人，最好的办法就是让他觉得你和他有一样的嗜好，把他的话当至理名言，把他的缺点说成优点，为他所做的事情鼓掌称赞。用不着害怕吹捧过了头，最聪明的人遇上拙劣的赞美也会上当的。再荒诞、再可笑的话，只要奉承着说，他也会欣然接受。我深知，做这事真诚多少要打点折扣，但是在有求于人的时候，我们也只好去迎合他们了，因为只有这样才能达到我们的目的。这不能怪吹捧的人，要怪就得怪那些愿意受吹捧的人。","Val. You know how much I wish it, and you can see how I set about it. You know the skilful manoeuvres I have had to use in order to introduce myself into his service; under what a mask of sympathy and conformity of tastes I disguise my own feelings to please him; and what a part I play to acquire his affection. I succeed wonderfully well, and I feel that to obtain favour with men, there are no better means than to pretend to be of their way of thinking, to fall in with their maxims, to praise their defects, and to applaud all their doings. One need not fear to overdo it, for however gross the flattery, the most cunning are easily duped; there is nothing so impertinent or ridiculous which they will not believe, provided it be well seasoned with praise. Honesty suffers, I acknowledge; but when we have need of men, we may be allowed without blame to adapt ourselves to their mode of thought; and if we have no other hope of success but through such stratagem, it is not after all the fault of those who flatter, but the fault of those who wish to be flattered."
"埃莉斯那你为何不试着去获得我哥哥的支持，万一那女仆泄露了我们的秘密呢？","Eli.Why do you not try also to gain my brother’s goodwill, in case the servant should betray our secret?"
"瓦莱尔我是怕同时应付两个人顾不过来。你父亲跟你哥哥的脾气相差甚远，让他们两个都喜欢我，恐怕很难。不过你可以找你哥哥，利用你们的手足之情，让他站在我们这边。他来了，我得走了。趁机跟他说一说，探探口风，看看我们到底能不能相信他。","Val.I am afraid I cannot humour them both. The temper of the father is so different from that of the son that it would be difficult to be the confidant of both at the same time. Rather try your brother yourself; make use of the love that exists between you to enlist him in our cause. I leave you, for I see him coming. Speak to him, sound him, and see how far we can trust him."
"埃莉斯我非常害怕，我不知道有没有那个胆量把我们的秘密告诉他。","Eli. I greatly fear I shall never have the courage to speak to him of my secret."
"第二场——克莱昂特，埃莉斯。","SCENE II.——CLÉANTE, ÉLISE,"
"克莱昂特我的妹妹，见你一个人在这里真高兴。我迫不及待要告诉你一个秘密。","Cle. I am very glad to find you alone, sister. I longed to speak to you and to tell you a secret."
"埃莉斯我很乐意听你说，哥哥。你想要告诉我什么呢？","Eli.I am quite ready to hear you, brother. What is it you have to tell me?"
"克莱昂特太多事情，妹妹，不过这都能概括成两个字——爱情。","Cle.Many things, sister, summed up in one word—love."
"埃莉斯你恋爱了？","Eli. You love?"
"克莱昂特是的，我恋爱了。不过，在我说这事之前，我得说，我知道自己该听从父亲的，作儿子的也该服从他的意愿。所以，没得到我们父母的同意就私定终身，这是不对的。上天已经决定由他们来主持我们的终身大事，我们的一言一行就应该顺从他们的意愿。他们都是过来人，能做出不偏不倚的判断。因此，他们也不会被虚假的表面所蒙骗，能更好地判断什么对我们有益。那么，我们就更应该信任他们的生活阅历，而不是自己的盲目热情。人年轻时的疯狂冲动，常常使我们陷入危险的深渊。这些我都知道，我的妹妹，我这样一说，就省得你再费口舌了，因为我的爱已让我无法再听进任何话，我恳求你，就不要劝阻我了。","Cle. Yes, I love. But, before I say more, let me tell you that I know I depend on my father, and that the name of son subjects me to his will; that it would be wrong to engage ourselves without the consent of the authors of our being; that heaven has made them the masters of our affections, and that it is our duty not to dispose of ourselves but in accordance to their wish; that their judgment is not biassed by their being in love themselves; that they are, therefore, much more likely not to be deceived by appearances, and to judge better what is good for us; that we ought to trust their experience rather than the passion which blinds us; and that the rashness of youth often carries us to the very brink of dangerous abysses. I know all this, my sister, and I tell it you to spare you the trouble of saying it to me, for my love will not let me listen to anything, and I pray you to spare me your remonstrances."
"埃莉斯哥哥，那你和你的爱人订下婚约了？","Eli.Have you engaged yourself, brother, to her you love?"
"克莱昂特还没有，不过我已决心要娶她。而且我再一次恳求你，不要再找什么理由来阻止我。","Cle. No, but I have determined to do so; and I beseech you once more not to bring forward any reason to dissuade me from it."
"埃莉斯哥哥，难道我是这么不近情理的人吗？","Eli. Am I such a very strange person, brother?"
"克莱昂特不，亲爱的妹妹。可是你没有恋爱过，你体会不到爱情给我们内心带来的甜蜜力量。而且我怕你的理智，怕你跟我说大道理。","Cle. No, dear sister; but you do not love. You know not the sweet power that love has upon our hearts; and I dread your wisdom."
"埃莉斯啊！哥哥，不要说我理智。这世上大部分人都很理智，可人一生中总有失去理智的时候。而且如果我告诉你我的心事，也许你会认为我还不如你理智呢。","Eli. Alas! my brother, let us not speak of my wisdom. There are very few people in this world who do not lack wisdom, were it only once in their lifetime; and if I opened my heart to you, perhaps you would think me less wise than you are yourself."
"克莱昂特啊！但愿你的情感也和我一样……","Cle. Ah!would to heaven that your heart, like mine …"
"埃莉斯还是先说你的事吧。跟我说说，你的爱人是谁。","Eli. Let us speak of you first, and tell me whom it is you love."
"克莱昂特她是最近搬到我们家附近的一个年轻女孩，一个人见人爱的姑娘。我亲爱的妹妹，大自然不会再造出比她更可爱的人了。第一眼看到她，我就像是获得了重生。她叫玛丽安娜，和她温柔善良的母亲住在一起。她母亲常年有病在身，可这个美丽的女孩对她却满生怜爱之心。她精心地照料着母亲，疼爱她、安抚她。她的温柔都能触动到你的心灵。她不管做什么事，都不失迷人魅力。她的一举一动都透出一种不可思议的优雅，一股无可匹敌的柔情，一种招人喜爱的谦逊，一个……噢！我的妹妹，我真希望你能亲眼看到她。","Cle. A young girl who has lately come to live in our neighbourhood, and who seems made to inspire love in all those who behold her. Nature, my dear sister, has made nothing more lovely; and I felt another man the moment I saw her. Her name is Marianne, and she lives with a good, kind mother, who is almost always ill, and for whom the dear girl shows the greatest affection. She waits upon her, pities and comforts her with a tenderness that would touch you to the very soul. Whatever she undertakes is done in the most charming way; and in all her actions shine a wonderful grace, a most winning gentleness, an adorable modesty, a … ah! my sister, how I wish you had but seen her."
"埃莉斯亲爱的哥哥，听了你的这一番描述，我仿佛已经看到了她。你对她的爱足以说明她是一个怎样的人。","Eli. I see many things in what you tell me, dear brother; and it is sufficient for me to know that you love her for me to understand what she is."
"克莱昂特在她们不知情的情况下，我已经发现她们家经济状况不好，尽管她们已经很节省了，可那仅有的财产很难应付日常的支出。试想一下，我的妹妹，能够改善所爱的人的生活条件，提供这个善良家庭的基本所需，这不也是一种幸福吗？然而，父亲的吝啬却剥夺了我获得这种幸福的权力，使我不能向我一生最爱的姑娘表达我的爱意，这对我来说是多么的痛苦啊。","Cle. I have discovered, without their knowing it, that they are not in very good circumstances, and that, although they live with the greatest care, they have barely enough to cover their expenses. Can you imagine, my sister, what happiness it must be to improve the condition of those we love; skilfully to bring about some relief to the modest wants of a virtuous family?And think what grief it is for me to find myself deprived of this great joy through the avarice of a father, and for it to be impossible for me to give any proof of my love to her who is all in all to me."
"埃莉斯是的，我理解，亲爱的哥哥，这对你来说一定非常痛苦。","Eli. Yes, I understand, dear brother, what sorrow this must be to you."
"克莱昂特我的妹妹，这痛苦你根本无法想象。父亲让我们过度地节衣缩食，还有什么比这更残酷？我们就该忍受这样不公的贫穷吗？如果我们得到财富的时候，美好年华已不在，现在却要为自己的日常开支四处借债，而且我们都不得不向商人低三下四才能穿上这体面的衣服，那这样的财富对我们还有什么好处可言？简而言之，我找你说这事，就是希望你帮我去探探父亲的口风，看他对我这事有何想法。如果他执意反对，我就决定离家出走，带着我心爱的女孩去别处生活，享受上天赐予我们的财富。我正努力为这事四处筹钱。亲爱的妹妹，如果你的心事也和我相似，自己的意愿与父亲背道而驰，我们就一起离他而去，摆脱长久以来那种令人难以忍受的吝啬对我们的折磨。","Cle. It is greater, my sister, than you can believe. For is there anything more cruel than this mean economy to which we are subjected?this strange penury in which we are made to pine?What good will it do us to have a fortune if it only comes to us when we are not able to enjoy it; if now to provide for my daily maintenance I get into debt on every side; if both you and I are reduced daily to beg the help of tradespeople in order to have decent clothes to wear?In short, I wanted to speak to you that you might help me to sound my father concerning my present feelings; and if I find him opposed to them, I am determined to go and live elsewhere with this most charming girl, and to make the best of what Providence offers us. I am trying everywhere to raise money for this purpose; and if your circumstances, dear sister, are like mine, and our father opposes us, let us both leave him, and free ourselves from the tyranny in which his hateful avarice has for so long held us."
"埃莉斯的确如此，父亲的做法越来越让我们怀疑母亲的早逝，还有……","Eli. It is but too true that every day he gives us more and more reason to regret the death of our mother, and that …"
"克莱昂特我听到他的声音了。我们先走到偏僻点的地方，把话说完。然后我们联合起来，一起去对付他那颗坚硬冷酷的心。","Cle. I hear his voice. Let us go a little farther and finish our talk. We will afterwards join our forces to make a common attack on his hard and unkind heart."
"第三场——阿巴贡，拉·弗莱什。","SCENE III.——HARPAGON, LA FLÈCHE."
"阿巴贡滚出去，现在就滚，我可不想再听你鬼扯。就现在，马上滚出我家，你这个无耻的小偷，真该被活活绞死。","Har. Get out of here, this moment; and let me have no more of your prating. Now then, be gone out of my house, you sworn pickpocket, you veritable gallows’ bird."
"拉·弗莱什（旁白）他是我见过的最邪恶的老东西。我真的相信，说得不好听一点，他是被恶魔缠身了。","La Fl. (aside). I never saw anything more wicked than this cursed old man; and I truly believe, if I may be allowed to say so, that he is possessed with a devil."
"阿巴贡你在那儿嘀咕什么呢？","Har. What are you muttering there between your teeth?"
"拉·弗莱什您凭什么赶我走？","La Fl. Why do you send me away?"
"阿巴贡你这个无赖还敢来问我？现在，趁我发善心没有好好鞭打你之前，滚出去。","Har. You dare to ask me my reasons, you scoundrel?Out with you, this moment, before I give you a good thrashing."
"拉·弗莱什我哪里招惹您了？","La Fl. What have I done to you?"
"阿巴贡就凭你杵在这儿，你就该被赶出去。","Har. Done this, that I wish you to be off."
"拉·弗莱什我的主人——您的儿子，命令我在这里候着他。","La Fl. My master, your son, gave me orders to wait for him."
"阿巴贡那就去大马路上等着去，赶快出去，别呆在我的房子里，像个硬邦邦的柱子。你贼兮兮地环顾四周，肯定想偷东西吧。我才不需要谁来时刻监视我的事务，像是一个奸诈的流氓，带着邪恶的眼神，觊觎我的财产，各处搜寻，不就为了能够偷点什么。","Har. Go and wait for him in the street, then; out with you; don’t stay in my house, straight and stiff as a sentry, to observe what is going on, and to make your profit of everything. I won’t always have before me a spy on all my affairs; a treacherous scamp, whose cursed eyes watch all my actions, covet all I possess, and ferret about in every corner to see if there is anything to steal."
"拉·弗莱什您觉得有谁可以从您这里偷得走东西？您把所有能值点钱的东西都锁上，派人日夜看守，像是会被偷的人吗？","La Fl. How the deuce could one steal anything from you?Are you a man likely to be robbed when you put every possible thing under lock and key, and mount guard day and night?"
"阿巴贡我的东西，我爱锁上就锁上，爱派人看管就派人看管。你这样盯住我的一举一动还不是监视？（旁白）我担心，他多半猜到我藏钱的事儿了。（高声）现在，还不承认是你到处散播谣言，说我家藏着财富呢？","Har. I will lock up whatever I think fit, and mount guard when and where I please. Did you ever see such spies as are set upon me to take note of everything I do?(Aside) I tremble for fear he should suspect something of my money. (Aloud) Now, aren’t you a fellow to give rise to stories about my having money hid in my house?"
"拉·弗莱什您家里藏了财富？","La Fl. You have some money hid in your house?"
"阿巴贡没有，你这无赖！我没说这话。（旁白）我真是气晕了！（高声）我只是在询问你，那些说我家藏财富的流言蜚语，是不是你居心不良散布出去的？","Har. No, scoundrel!I do not say that. (Aside) I am furious!(Aloud) I only ask if out of mischief you do not spread abroad the report that I have some?"
"拉·弗莱什哦！您有钱还是没钱，这有什么要紧？反正对我们来说都一样。","La Fl. Oh!What does it matter whether you have money, or whether you have not, since it is all the same to us?"
"阿巴贡（举起手想给弗莱什一个耳光）哦！哦！你想顶嘴，是吧？我这就让你体会一下巴掌打在耳朵上的滋味。我再说一遍，给我滚出去。","Har. (raising his hand to give La Flèche a blow). Oh! oh!You want to argue, do you?I will give you, and quickly too, some few of these arguments about your ears. Get out of the house, I tell you once more."
"拉·弗莱什好，好，我这就走。","La Fl. Very well; very well. I am going."
"阿巴贡别慌，等会儿，你拿走什么东西没有？","Har. No, wait; are you carrying anything away with you?"
"拉·弗莱什我能拿走什么？","La Fl. What can I possibly carry away?"
"阿巴贡过来，我看看。两只手伸出来。","Har. Come here, and let me see. Show me your hands."
"拉·弗莱什这儿呢。","La Fl. There they are."
"阿巴贡其他的。","Har. The others."
"拉·弗莱什其他的？","La Fl. The others?"
"阿巴贡对。","Har. Yes."
"拉·弗莱什在这儿。","La Fl. There they are."
"阿巴贡（指着弗莱什的裤子）那里面藏东西没有？","Har. (pointing to La Flèche’s breeches). Have you anything hid in here?"
"拉·弗莱什您自己瞧吧。","La Fl. Look for yourself."
"阿巴贡（摸了摸弗莱什的裤腿）穿这种宽松的肥裤子最适合藏东西，我真恨不得把那裤腿剪了去。","Har. (feeling the knees of the breeches). These wide knee-breeches are convenient receptacles of stolen goods; and I wish a pair of them had been hanged."
"拉·弗莱什（旁白）啊！他这么有钱的人就该被偷。要是我能从他这儿偷点什么，那可太好了。","La Fl. (aside). Ah!how richly such a man deserves what he fears, and what joy it would be to me to steal some of his …"
"阿巴贡嗯？","Har. Eh?"
"拉·弗莱什什么？","La Fl. What?"
"阿巴贡你在那儿嘀咕什么偷不偷的？","Har. What is it you talk of stealing?"
"拉·弗莱什我说，您可以搜遍我全身，看看我到底有没有偷您的东西。","La Fl. I say that you feel about everywhere to see if I have been stealing anything."
"阿巴贡我正打算要这样做。（他开始搜弗莱什的衣服口袋。）","Har. And I mean to do so too. (He feels in La Flèche’s pockets)."
"拉·弗莱什这该死的吝啬和吝啬鬼！","La Fl. Plague take all misers and all miserly ways!"
"阿巴贡嗯？你嘀咕什么？","Har. Eh?What do you say?"
"拉·弗莱什我嘀咕什么了？","La Fl. What do I say?"
"阿巴贡你说了，你说什么吝啬和吝啬鬼。","Har. Yes. What is it you say about misers and miserly ways."
"拉·弗莱什我说，这该死的吝啬和吝啬鬼。","La Fl. I say plague take all misers and all miserly ways."
"阿巴贡你说谁呢？","Har. Of whom do you speak?"
"拉·弗莱什说吝啬鬼呢。","La Fl. Of misers."
"阿巴贡谁是吝啬鬼？","Har. And who are they, these misers?"
"拉·弗莱什小气卑鄙的坏人。","La Fl. Villains and stingy wretches!"
"阿巴贡你说这些是指谁？","Har. But what do you mean by that?"
"拉·弗莱什您为何自寻烦恼，这么关心我说的话？","La Fl. Why do you trouble yourself so much about what I say?"
"阿巴贡该关心的我就关心。","Har. I trouble myself because I think it right to do so."
"拉·弗莱什您觉得我是在指您？","La Fl. Do you think I am speaking about you?"
"阿巴贡我爱怎么想怎么想，但是你必须得说清楚了，你这些话到底是跟谁说的。","Har. I think what I think; but I insist upon your telling me to whom you speak when you say that."
"拉·弗莱什跟谁说？我跟帽子里的人说话呢。","La Fl. To whom I speak?I am speaking to the inside of my hat."
"阿巴贡那么我可能得跟脑袋外面的人好好说话了。","Har. And I will, perhaps, speak to the outside of your head."
"拉·弗莱什您不准我诅咒吝啬鬼？","La Fl. Would you prevent me from cursing misers?"
"阿巴贡不，不过我不允许你这样无礼，瞎说一通。你给我闭嘴。","Har. No; but I will prevent you from prating and from being insolent. Hold your tongue, will you?"
"拉·弗莱什我没有指名道姓。","La Fl. I name nobody."
"阿巴贡再说一句，看我不打你。","Har. Another word, and I’ll thrash you."
"拉·弗莱什这帽子扣在谁头上最合适，谁自个儿清楚。","La Fl. He whom the cap fits, let him wear it."
"阿巴贡你还不闭嘴？","Har. Will you be silent?"
"拉·弗莱什是，我也是忍不住。","La Fl. Yes; much against my will."
"阿巴贡啊！啊！","Har. Ah! ah!"
"拉·弗莱什（向阿巴贡示意自己一个上衣口袋）看吧，这儿还剩一个口袋。您满意了吗？","La Fl. (showing Harpagon one of his doublet pockets).Just look, here is one more pocket. Are you satisfied?"
"阿巴贡来吧，直接把东西给我，我就不搜身了。","Har. Come, give it up to me without all that fuss."
"拉·弗莱什给您什么？","La Fl. Give you what?"
"阿巴贡你从我这儿偷走的东西。","Har. What you have stolen from me."
"拉·弗莱什我根本什么都没偷您的。","La Fl. I have stolen nothing at all from you."
"阿巴贡你当真没偷？","Har. Are you telling the truth?"
"拉·弗莱什真的。","La Fl. Yes."
"阿巴贡再见，你去见鬼去吧。","Har. Good-bye, then, and now you may go to the devil."
"拉·弗莱什（旁白）这样打发我，真是有礼貌啊。","La Fl. (aside). That’s a nice way of dismissing anyone."
"阿巴贡记住，我是要让你受到良心的谴责！","Har. I leave it to your conscience, remember!"
"第四场——阿巴贡（一个人）。","SCENE IV.——HARPAGON (alone.)"
"这该死的仆人真让我头痛，每次看到这没用的瘸子，我就来气。真是的，管理好家里这一大笔财富可不是一件省心的事情，最好就是把钱都贷出去，身边仅留够日常生活必不可少的支出就可以了。要在家里选择一个最保险的地方把钱藏起来，还真是难倒我了。别跟我提保险箱，我压根儿就不信那玩意儿。为什么，因为保险箱就是引贼入室的诱饵！","This rascally valet is a constant vexation to me; and I hate the very sight of the good-for-nothing cripple. Really, it is no small anxiety to keep by one a large sum of money; and happy is the man who has all his cash well invested, and who needs not keep by him more than he wants for his daily expenses. I am not a little puzzled to find in the whole of this house a safe hiding-place. Don’t speak to me of your strong boxes, I will never trust to them. Why, they are just the very things thieves set upon!"
"第五场——阿巴贡，埃莉斯和克莱昂特在舞台后面说话。","SCENE V.——HARPAGON, ÉLISE and CLÉANTE are seen talking together at the back of the stage."
"阿巴贡（独自思考）再说了，我把昨天人家还的一万克朗埋在花园里，不知道够不够安全。要知道，一万克朗的金币可不是一笔小数目……（旁白，看见了埃莉斯和克莱昂特在说悄悄话）哎呀！天啊！我说漏嘴了，这一高兴就忘形了，刚才我说话的声音太大了吧。（对埃莉斯和克莱昂特）你们有事吗？","Har. (thinking himself alone.) Meanwhile, I hardly know whether I did right to bury in my garden the ten thousand crowns which were paid to me yesterday. Ten thousand crowns in gold is a sum sufficiently … (Aside, on perceiving Élise and Cléante whispering together) Good heavens!I have betrayed myself; my warmth has carried me away. I believe I spoke aloud while reasoning with myself. (To Cléante and Élise) What do you want?"
"克莱昂特没事，父亲。","Cle. Nothing, father."
"阿巴贡你们在这儿呆了很长时间吗？","Har. Have you been here long?"
"埃莉斯我们刚刚到。","Eli. We have only just come."
"阿巴贡那你们听到……","Har. Did you hear…?"
"克莱昂特什么，父亲？","Cle. What, father?"
"阿巴贡就是……","Har. There…!"
"克莱昂特什么？","Cle. What?"
"阿巴贡我刚才说的话。","Har. What I was just now saying."
"克莱昂特没有。","Cle. No."
"阿巴贡你们听到了，我知道你们听到了。","Har. You did. I know you did."
"埃莉斯请您原谅，父亲，可我们真的没听到。","Eli. I beg your pardon, father, but we did not."
"阿巴贡我知道你们是无意听到了一部分。事实上，我只是自言自语，说这年头挣点钱太困难了，要是谁家里能有个一万克朗的财产，那他真是太有福气了。","Har. I see well enough that you overheard a few words. The fact is, I was only talking to myself about the trouble one has nowadays to raise any money; and I was saying that he is a fortunate man who has ten thousand crowns in his house."
"克莱昂特我们不敢走过来，是怕打扰到您。","Cle. We were afraid of coming near you, for fear of intruding."
"阿巴贡我很愿意向你们澄清这一点，这样你们就不会曲解我的意思，误以为我是在说我藏有那一万克朗。","Har. I am very glad to tell you this, so that you may not misinterpret things, and imagine that I said that it was I who have ten thousand crowns."
"克莱昂特我们并不希望干预您的私事。","Cle. We do not wish to interfere in your affairs."
"阿巴贡我倒是真希望我有那一万克朗啊！","Har. Would that I had them, these ten thousand crowns!"
"克莱昂特我不应该认为那……","Cle. I should not think that …"
"阿巴贡这对我来说可是一件大好事。","Har. What a capital affair it would be for me."
"克莱昂特有些事情……","Cle. There are things …"
"阿巴贡我真的非常需要这笔钱。","Har. I greatly need them."
"克莱昂特我觉得……","Cle. I fancy that …"
"阿巴贡有了那钱我手头可就宽裕多了。","Har. It would suit me exceedingly well."
"埃莉斯您在……","Eli. You are …"
"阿巴贡这样一来，我就不用像现在这样满腹牢骚，抱怨自己遇上了坏时代。","Har. And I should not have to complain, as I do now, that the times are bad."
"克莱昂特听我说，父亲，您没道理发牢骚，大家都知道您有的是钱。","Cle. Hear me, father, you have no reason to complain; and everyone knows that you are well enough off."
"阿巴贡什么？我有的是钱？！说这话的人都是骗子，这都是假话，而且是一些无赖在散播这种谣言。","Har. How?I am well enough off!Those who say it are liars. Nothing can be more false; and they are scoundrels who spread such reports."
"埃莉斯不要发火。","Eli. Don’t be angry."
"阿巴贡这真是奇怪，我自己的孩子也背叛我，跟我作对。","Har. It is strange that my own children betray me and become my enemies."
"克莱昂特难道说您有钱就是跟您作对？","Cle. Is it being your enemy to say that you have wealth?"
"阿巴贡是，就是跟我作对。这样的流言蜚语，再加上你胡乱花钱，小偷会真的以为我家财万贯，总有一天他们会跑到我们家把我杀了。","Har. Yes, it is. Such talk and your extravagant expenses will be the cause that some day thieves will come and cut my throat, in the belief that I am made of gold."
"克莱昂特我怎么胡乱花钱了？","Cle. What extravagant expenses do I indulge in?"
"阿巴贡什么！你穿着这身奢侈的衣服招摇过市，还有比这更惹是生非的吗？我昨天还为此责备了你妹妹，可你比她还奢侈。这会招来上天报应的。而且算一算你这身打扮，从头到脚，都足够放一年的债了。我已经跟你说过一百遍了，我的孩子，你的做法我一点都不喜欢。你就喜欢侯爵的装扮，为了能穿上这样的衣服，你一定偷了我的钱。","Har. What!Is there anything more scandalous than this sumptuous attire with which you jaunt it about the town?I was remonstrating with your sister yesterday, but you are still worse.It cries vengeance to heaven; and were we to calculate all you are wearing, from head to foot, we should find enough for a good annuity. I have told you a hundred times, my son, that your manners displease me exceedingly; you affect the marquis terribly, and for you to be always dressed as you are, you must certainly rob me."
"克莱昂特偷您的钱？要怎么偷？","Cle. Rob you?And how?"
"阿巴贡我怎么知道？你还能从哪里弄到这么多的钱，买这样一身衣服？","Har. How should I know?Where else could you find money enough to clothe yourself as you do?"
"克莱昂特从我自己这里，父亲！我赌钱。我手气很好，我用自己赢来的钱买这些衣服。","Cle. I, father?I play; and as I am very lucky, I spend in clothes all the money I win."
"阿巴贡这一点都不聪明。如果你真的手气好，你就应该利用它去赚钱，然后放贷出去吃利息，以后连本带利地收回来。我非常想弄清楚，比方说，不说其他的，从头到脚挂这些乱七八糟的丝带有什么用处，难道六根绳子还不够系紧你的裤子。我们都有天生的头发，不花钱，难道还有必要花钱去买假发戴上吗？我敢打赌，这假发加上带子至少得花二十个皮斯托尔，而这些钱以百分之八的利息放贷出去，一年就能获得十八里弗六苏八丹尼尔了。","Har. It is very wrong. If you are lucky at play, you should profit by it, and place the money you win at decent interest, so that you may find it again some day.I should like to know, for instance, without mentioning the rest, what need there is for all these ribbons with which you are decked from head to foot, and if half a dozen tags are not sufficient to fasten your breeches. What necessity is there for anyone to spend money upon wigs, when we have hair of our own growth, which costs nothing.I will lay a wager that, in wigs and ribbons alone, there are certainly twenty pistoles spent, and twenty pistoles brings in at least eighteen livres six sous eight deniers per annum, at only eight per cent interest."
"克莱昂特您所言极是。","Cle. You are quite right."
"阿巴贡这个话题就说到这里，接下来说点别的吧。（旁白，看到克莱昂特和埃莉斯互相递眼色）他们俩相互打手势一定是想偷我的钱。（高声）你们打手势是什么意思？","Har. Enough on this subject; let us talk of something else. (Aside, noticing Cléante and Élise, who make signs to one another) I believe they are making signs to one another to pick my pocket. (Aloud) What do you mean by those signs?"
"埃莉斯我和哥哥是在犹豫谁先说，因为我们俩都有事情要跟您说。","Eli. We are hesitating as to who shall speak first, for we both have something to tell you."
"阿巴贡我正好也有事情跟你们说。","Har. And I also have something to tell you both."
"克莱昂特我们来是想跟您商量婚事的，父亲。","Cle. We wanted to speak to you about marriage, father."
"阿巴贡这也是我想要跟你们说的。","Har. The very thing I wish to speak to you about."
"埃莉斯啊！我的父亲！","Eli. Ah! my father!"
"阿巴贡你大叫什么？女儿，是我说的话，还是这件事让你害怕了？","Har. What is the meaning of that exclamation?Is it the word, daughter, or the thing itself that frightens you?"
"克莱昂特让我们俩害怕的是您怎么看待婚姻这件事，而且担心我们的爱情可能不符合您的标准。","Cle. Marriage may frighten us both according to the way you take it; and our feelings may perhaps not coincide with your choice."
"阿巴贡请耐心一点。你们没必要这么惊慌。我清楚什么样的人最适合你们，你们也没有理由抱怨我将要为你们做的事。我们从头说起。（对着克莱昂特）告诉我，你知道有一个叫玛丽安娜的姑娘住在我们家附近吗？","Har. A little patience, if you please. You need not be alarmed.I know what is good for you both, and you will have no reason to complain of anything I intend to do. To begin at the beginning. (To Cléante) Do you know, tell me, a young person, called Marianne, who lives not far from here?"
"克莱昂特是的，父亲。","Cle. Yes, father."
"阿巴贡你呢？","Har. And you?"
"埃莉斯我听说过她。","Eli. I have heard her spoken of."
"阿巴贡那么，我的儿子，你觉得这个女孩怎么样？","Har. Well, my son, and how do you like the girl?"
"克莱昂特她是个惹人爱的女孩。","Cle. She is very charming."
"阿巴贡她的相貌？","Har. Her face?"
"克莱昂特端庄而且乖巧机灵。","Cle. Modest and intelligent."
"阿巴贡她的言谈举止？","Har. Her air and manner?"
"克莱昂特当然是无可挑剔。","Cle. Perfect, undoubtedly."
"阿巴贡你不认为这样好的女孩值得我们考虑吗？","Har. Do you not think that such a girl well deserves to be thought of?"
"克莱昂特当然值了，父亲。","Cle. Yes, father."
"阿巴贡那这是一桩理想的婚姻吗？","Har. She would form a very desirable match?"
"克莱昂特非常理想。","Cle. Very desirable."
"阿巴贡她看起来像是能成为一个节俭持家，懂得关怀的妻子。","Har. That there is every likelihood of her making a thrifty and careful wife."
"克莱昂特那是自然。","Cle. Certainly."
"阿巴贡那她会让她的丈夫称心如意吗？","Har. And that a husband might live very happily with her?"
"克莱昂特这一点我坚信不疑。","Cle. I have not the least doubt about it."
"阿巴贡不过有一个小小的困难——我担心她没有我们所期望的财富。","Har. There is one little difficulty; I am afraid she has not the fortune we might reasonably expect."
"克莱昂特噢，我的父亲，要是能够娶到一位善良的妻子，财富无关紧要。","Cle. Oh, my father, riches are of little importance when one is sure of marrying a virtuous woman."
"阿巴贡请原谅我。我只是想说，如果从她那不能得到所期望的钱财，我们可以想别的办法来弥补。","Har. I beg your pardon. Only there is this to be said: that if we do not find as much money as we could wish, we may make it up in something else."
"克莱昂特那是当然的了。","Cle. That follows as a matter of course."
"阿巴贡好，我非常高兴你能同意我的想法。她的端庄举止和优雅谈吐征服了我的心，我已经决定要和她结婚，如果我能从中得到点嫁妆。","Har. Well, I must say that I am very much pleased to find that you entirely agree with me, for her modest manner and her gentleness have won my heart; and I have made up my mind to marry her, provided I find she has some dowry."
"克莱昂特啊！","Cle. Eh!"
"阿巴贡这次怎么了？","Har. What now?"
"克莱昂特您刚才说，您下定决心要……？","Cle. You are resolved, you say…?"
"阿巴贡我要和玛丽安娜结婚。","Har. To marry Marianne."
"克莱昂特谁？您？您？","Cle. Who? you? you?"
"阿巴贡是的，是我、是我、是我。你这是怎么了？","Har. Yes, I, I, I. What does all this mean?"
"克莱昂特我突然感觉有些头昏，我得先离开一会儿。","Cle. I feel a sudden dizziness, and I must withdraw for a little while."
"阿巴贡这没什么大不了的，赶快去厨房喝上一大杯冷水，一会儿就没事了。","Har. It will be nothing. Go quickly into the kitchen and drink a large glass of cold water, it will soon set you all right again."
"第六场——阿巴贡，埃莉斯。","SCENE VI.——HARPAGON, ÉLISE."
"阿巴贡瞧瞧这些娇生惯养的公子哥儿，还没一只雏鸡壮实呢。女儿啊，这就是我为自己做的决定。至于你的哥哥，我给他物色了一个寡妇，今天早上有人来跟我谈过了。至于你，我把你许配给了安塞尔姆先生。","Har. There goes one of your effeminate fops, with no more stamina than a chicken. That is what I have resolved for myself, my daughter. As to your brother, I have thought for him of a certain widow, of whom I heard this morning; and you I shall give to Mr. Anselme."
"埃莉斯安塞尔姆先生？","Eli. To Mr. Anselme?"
"阿巴贡没错，他是一个稳重谨慎的男人，还不到五十岁，人人都说他非常有钱。","Har. Yes, a staid and prudent man, who is not above fifty, and of whose riches everybody speaks."
"埃莉斯（向父亲鞠躬行礼）我不想结婚，父亲，求求您。","Eli. (curtseying). I have no wish to marry, father, if you please."
"阿巴贡（模仿埃莉斯的鞠躬礼）可是，我的女儿，我的心肝儿，我想让你结婚，求你了。","Har. (imitating Élise). And I, my little girl, my darling, I wish you to marry, if you please."
"埃莉斯（再行鞠躬礼）请您原谅，我的父亲。","Eli. (curtseying again). I beg your pardon, my father."
"阿巴贡（再模仿埃莉斯的鞠躬礼）请你原谅，我的女儿。","Har. (again imitating Élise). I beg your pardon, my daughter."
"埃莉斯我对安塞尔姆先生非常敬佩，可是（再行鞠躬礼），请您原谅，我不想嫁给他。","Eli. I am the very humble servant of Mr. Anselme, but (curtseying again), with your leave, I shall not marry him."
"阿巴贡我对你也非常敬佩，可是（再模仿埃莉斯的鞠躬礼），你今晚就得嫁给他。","Har. I am your very humble servant, but (again imitating Élise) you will marry him this very evening."
"埃莉斯今晚？","Eli. This evening?"
"阿巴贡就是今晚。","Har. This evening."
"埃莉斯（再行鞠躬礼）这办不到，父亲。","Eli. (curtseying again). It cannot be done, father."
"阿巴贡（再模仿埃莉斯的鞠躬礼）这办得到，女儿。","Har. (imitating Élise). It will be done, daughter."
"埃莉斯不行。","Eli. No."
"阿巴贡行。","Har. Yes."
"埃莉斯不行，我说了。","Eli. No, I tell you."
"阿巴贡就行，我说了。","Har. Yes, I tell you."
"埃莉斯这种事情您不能强迫我。","Eli. You will never force me to do such a thing"
"阿巴贡这件事我必须强迫你。","Har. I will force you to it."
"埃莉斯我宁可自杀也不愿意嫁给他。","Eli. I had rather kill myself than marry such a man."
"阿巴贡你不会自杀，你要嫁给他。看看你自己，怎么这么放肆？谁听过有女儿这样跟父亲说话的？","Har. You will not kill yourself, and you will marry him. But did you ever see such impudence?Did ever any one hear a daughter speak in such a fashion to her father?"
"埃莉斯那谁又见过有父亲这样让女儿出嫁的？","Eli. But did ever anyone see a father marry his daughter after such a fashion?"
"阿巴贡这门婚事无可挑剔，我肯定，所有人都会赞同我的决定。","Har. It is a match against which nothing can be said, and I am perfectly sure that everybody will approve of my choice."
"埃莉斯可我相信任何有理智的人都不会同意的。","Eli. And I know that it will be approved of by no reasonable person."
"阿巴贡（看到瓦莱尔）瓦莱尔来了。我们不如让他来评一评理？","Har. (seeing Valère). There is Valère coming. Shall we make him judge in this affair?"
"埃莉斯我愿意。","Eli. Willingly."
"阿巴贡你服从他的评判吗？","Har. You will abide by what he says?"
"埃莉斯是的，只要他认为是对的，我都会照做。","Eli. Yes, whatever he thinks right, I will do."
"阿巴贡一言为定。","Har. Agreed."
"第七场——瓦莱尔，阿巴贡，埃莉斯。","SCENE VII.——VALÈRE, HARPAGON, ÉLISE."
"阿巴贡瓦莱尔，你来评判一下，我们俩谁说的有理，是我女儿，还是我。","Har. Valère, we have chosen you to decide who is in the right, my daughter or I."
"瓦莱尔那肯定是您啦，老爷。","Val. It is certainly you, Sir."
"阿巴贡可是，你知道我们在说什么吗？","Har. But have you any idea of what we are talking about?"
"瓦莱尔不知道，但是您不会有错的，您总是正确的。","Val. No; but you could not be in the wrong; you are reason itself."
"阿巴贡我想今晚就把我女儿嫁给一个富裕又理智的人，可是这丫头竟然对我说她不愿意嫁给他。这事你怎么看？","Har. I want to give her to-night, for a husband, a man as rich as he is good; and the hussy tells me to my face that she scorns to take him.What do you say to that?"
"瓦莱尔我怎么看？","Val. What I say to it?"
"阿巴贡是啊。","Har. Yes?"
"瓦莱尔呃！呃！","Val. Eh!eh!"
"阿巴贡什么？","Har. What?"
"瓦莱尔我是说，我不反对您的决定，您不会做错误的决定。可是，也许小姐她也未必全错，而且……","Val. I say that I am, upon the whole, of your opinion, and that you cannot but be right; yet, perhaps, she is not altogether wrong; and …"
"阿巴贡怎么会这样？安塞尔姆先生可是个了不起的人物，他既是贵族又是绅士，生活简单，并且非常的富有。他前妻也没为他留下孩子。我女儿还能找到一个比他更好的人吗？","Har. How so?Mr. Anselme is an excellent match; he is a nobleman, and a gentleman too; of simple habits, and extremely well off.He has no children left from his first marriage. Could she meet with anything more suitable?"
"瓦莱尔：确实如此。但是小姐也许认为这事有些匆忙，您至少该多给她一点时间让她慢慢考虑，想清楚该不该接受这桩婚事……","Val. It is true. But she might say that you are going rather fast, and that she ought to have at least a little time to consider whether her inclination could reconcile itself to …"
"阿巴贡这可是一个千载难逢的好机会，不能错过。我会从他那儿得到从别处得不到的好处，而且他还答应不要女方嫁妆。","Har. It is an opportunity I must not allow to slip through my fingers.I find an advantage here which I should not find elsewhere, and he agrees to take her without dowry."
"瓦莱尔不要嫁妆？","Val. Without dowry?"
"阿巴贡是的。","Har. Yes."
"瓦莱尔啊！那我没什么可说的了。没有比这更有说服力的理由了，小姐不能拒绝这门婚事。","Val. Ah!I have nothing more to say. A more convincing reason could not be found; and she must yield to that."
"阿巴贡这对我来说可省下一大笔钱。","Har. It is a considerable saving to me."
"瓦莱尔当然了，这一点谁都不会反对。可是，小姐也对您说过了，婚姻是一件大事，比人们想象中还要重要，这关系到她一生能否幸福，这是一辈子的承诺，必须经过慎重考虑才能决定。","Val. Undoubtedly; this admits of no contradiction.It is true that your daughter might represent to you that marriage is a more serious affair than people are apt to believe; that the happiness or misery of a whole life depends on it, and that an engagement which is to last till death ought not to be entered into without great consideration."
"阿巴贡不要嫁妆！","Har. Without dowry!"
"瓦莱尔这当然是决定性的。不过肯定也有人对您说过，在这时候，毫无疑问应该重视一下女儿的意愿。还有，年龄、性格、感情上的巨大差异，会给婚姻带来很多不愉快的事情。","Val. That must of course decide everything. There are certainly people who might tell you that on such occasions the wishes of a daughter are no doubt to be considered, and that this great disparity of age, of disposition, and of feelings might be the cause of many an unpleasant thing in a married life."
"阿巴贡不要嫁妆！","Har. Without dowry!"
"瓦莱尔啊！这一点无可争议，有谁会否认呢？我想说的是，天下有很多父亲更看重自己女儿是否幸福，而不是计较金钱。他们不会为了自己的利益牺牲掉自己女儿。对于女儿的婚事，他们首先想到的是两个人的甜蜜结合能否让两人过上彼此尊重、和睦、快乐的生活，而且……","Val. Ah! it must be granted that there is no reply to that; who in the world could think otherwise?I do not mean to say but that there are many fathers who would set a much higher value on the happiness of their daughter than on the money they may have to give for their marriage; who would not like to sacrifice them to their own interests, and who would, above all things, try to see in a marriage that sweet conformity of tastes which is a sure pledge of honour, tranquillity and joy; and that …"
"阿巴贡不要嫁妆！","Har. Without dowry!"
"瓦莱尔事实如此，这令人无话可说。不要嫁妆。这理由谁能抗拒？","Val. That is true; nothing more can be said. Without dowry. How can anyone resist such arguments?"
"阿巴贡（旁白，目光投向花园）啊！我好像听见了狗叫。该不会是有人想偷走我的钱吧。（对着瓦莱尔）先说到这儿，我等会儿就回来。","Har. (aside, looking towards the garden). Ah! I fancy I hear a dog barking. Is anyone after my money. (To Valère) Stop here, I’ll come back directly."
"第八场——埃莉斯，瓦莱尔。","SCENE VIII.——ÉLISE, VALÈRE."
"埃莉斯瓦莱尔，你刚才对我父亲所说的话，肯定是开玩笑的吧？","Eli. Surely, Valère, you are not in earnest when you speak to him in that manner?"
"瓦莱尔我那样说是为了不激怒你父亲，也是为了达到我们的目的。要是当面跟他顶撞，只会把事情弄糟。对付有些人只能用迂回的办法，他们无法忍受一点反抗，生性倔强，你说真话，他们就发脾气，你讲道理，他们死活不肯听，所以我们只能兜圈子，让他跟着我们走。","Val. I do it that I may not vex him, and the better to secure my ends. To resist him boldly would simply spoil everything. There are certain people who are only to be managed by indirect means, temperaments averse from all resistance, restive natures whom truth causes to rear, who always kick when we would lead them on the right road of reason, and who can only be led by a way opposed to that by which you wish them to go. "
"埃莉斯可这婚事怎么办，瓦莱尔？","Eli. But this marriage, Valère?"
"瓦莱尔我们得想方法取消它。","Val. We will find some pretext for breaking it off."
"埃莉斯但是婚事就定在今晚，我们能想到什么办法？","Eli. But what pretext can we find if it is to be concluded to-night?"
"瓦莱尔你必须想法儿拖延时间，假装生病什么的。","Val. You must ask to have it delayed, and must feign some illness or other."
"埃莉斯可是他们只要一请医生来，就会发现我是装病。","Eli. But he will soon discover the truth if they call in the doctor."
"瓦莱尔才不会呢。你以为医生能知道什么？都是胡说！别怕，相信我，你可以随便说你有什么病，因为医生一定会去找你生病的原因的。","Val. Not a bit of it. Do you imagine that a doctor understands what he is about?Nonsense!Don’t be afraid. Believe me, you may complain of any disease you please, the doctor will be at no loss to explain to you from what it proceeds."
"第九场——阿巴贡，埃莉斯，瓦莱尔。","SCENE IX——HARPAGON, ÉLISE, VALÈRE."
"阿巴贡（独自一人在远处舞台）一切正常，谢天谢地！","Har. (alone, at the farther end of the stage). It is nothing, thank heaven!"
"瓦莱尔（没看见阿巴贡）简而言之，我们还有最后一招，那就是一走了之。亲爱的埃莉斯，如果你对我的爱真的……（看到了阿巴贡）是的，女儿必须遵从父亲的意愿。她没有权力去想自己的丈夫是个什么样的人，而且面对“不要嫁妆”这最重要的条件，身为女儿应当服从一切安排。","Val. (not seeing Harpagon). In short, flight is the last resource we have left us to avoid all this; and if your love, dear Élise, is as strong as … (Seeing Harpagon) Yes, a daughter is bound to obey her father. She has no right to inquire what a husband offered to her is like, and when the most important question, “without dowry,” presents itself, she should accept anybody that is given her."
"阿巴贡好，你说的太好了！","Har. Good; that was beautifully said!"
"瓦莱尔请您原谅，老爷，我有点太过火了，竟敢这么跟她说话。","Val. I beg your pardon, Sir, if I carry it a little too far, and take upon myself to speak to her as I do."
"阿巴贡怎么会，我非常高兴，我希望你全权控制她。（对埃莉斯）对，你想躲也没有用。我让他行使上天赐予我管教你的权利，我要让你照他说的去做。","Har. Why, I am delighted, and I wish you to have her entirely under your control. (To Élise) Yes, you may run away as much as you like. I give him all the authority over you that heaven has given me, and I will have you do all that he tells you."
"瓦莱尔那么现在，你还敢不听我的话吗？","Val. After that, resist all my expostulations, if you can."
"第十场——阿巴贡，瓦莱尔。","SCENE X.——HARPAGON, VALÈRE."
"瓦莱尔老爷，如果您允许，我会跟着她，继续这么教育她的。","Val. I will follow her, Sir, if you will allow me, and will continue the lecture I was giving her."
"阿巴贡是的，就这么办，我真得非常感激你。","Har. Yes, do so; you will oblige me greatly."
"瓦莱尔应该对小姐严加看管。","Val. She ought to be kept in with a tight hand."
"阿巴贡千真万确，你一定……","Har. Quite true, you must …"
"瓦莱尔您不用担心，我相信我会说服她的。","Val. Do not be afraid; I believe I shall end by convincing her."
"阿巴贡去吧，去吧。我要进城一趟，很快就回来。","Har. Do so, do so. I am going to take a short stroll in the town, and I will come back again presently."
"瓦莱尔（走向刚才埃莉斯离开的门口，假装对着她说。）是的，金钱是世界上最宝贵的东西，你应该感谢上苍赐予你一位这样通情达理的父亲。他懂得生活是怎么回事。如果有人愿意娶一个没有嫁妆的姑娘，我们不应该再有别的要求了。不要嫁妆就包涵了一切，“不要嫁妆”能够弥补英俊、年轻、出身、荣誉、智慧和正直的缺乏。","Val. (going towards the door through which Élise left, and speaking as if it were to her). Yes, money is more precious than anything else in the world, and you should thank heaven that you have so worthy a man for a father.He knows what life is. When a man offers to marry a girl without a dowry, we ought to look no farther.Everything is comprised in that, and “without dowry” compensates for want of beauty, youth, birth, honour, wisdom, and probity."
"阿巴贡啊！真是一个诚实的人！他说的话就像是神谕。能有这样一个仆人真让人高兴！","Har. Ah! the honest fellow! he speaks like an oracle. Happy is he who can secure such a servant!"
"第二幕","ACT II."
"第一场——克莱昂特，拉·弗莱什。","SCENE I.——CLÉANTE, LA FLÈCHE."
"克莱昂特现在才来，你这无赖！你都躲哪儿去了？我不是吩咐过你……","Cle. How now, you rascal! where have you been hiding?Did I not give you orders to…?"
"拉·弗莱什是的，少爷，我可在这儿一直恭候着您，可是您父亲，那个最讨厌的人，硬是把我赶到街上去了，他还差点要狠狠地揍我一顿呢。","La Fl. Yes, Sir, and I came here resolved to wait for you without stirring, but your father, that most ungracious of men, drove me into the street in spite of myself, and I well nigh got a good drubbing into the bargain."
"克莱昂特我们的事情办得怎么样了？现在的情况更加紧急了，你不在的时候，我发现我的父亲竟然是我的情敌。","Cle. How is our affair progressing?Things are worse than ever for us, and since I left you, I have discovered that my own father is my rival."
"拉·弗莱什老爷也在谈恋爱？","La Fl. Your father in love?"
"克莱昂特看来是这样的。我竭力控制住自己，没让他看出我对此事的心慌意乱。","Cle. It seems so; and I found it very difficult to hide from him what I felt at such a discovery."
"拉·弗莱什他在玩弄爱情！他心里到底打的什么主意？他是不是要跟所有人作对？像他这种人也配拥有爱情？","La Fl. He meddling with love!What the deuce is he thinking of?Does he mean to set everybody at defiance?And is love made for people of his build?"
"克莱昂特一定是我造的孽，他居然也有了这种感情。","Cle. It is to punish me for my sins that this passion has entered his head."
"拉·弗莱什可你为何要向他隐瞒自己的爱情呢？","La Fl. But why do you hide your love from him?"
"克莱昂特这是为了不让他起疑心，到了紧要关头，我好全身而退。若是需要，我得想个对策让这婚事取消。你收到了什么答复？","Cle. That he may not suspect anything, and to make it more easy for me to fall back, if need be, upon some device to prevent this marriage. What answer did you receive?"
"拉·弗莱什少爷，说实话，向别人借钱真是让人怜悯，尤其像少爷您现在的状况，我们被迫得求助放高利贷的人了，不论遇到什么奇怪的事情，我们要能忍。","La Fl. Indeed, Sir, those who borrow are much to be pitied, and we must put up with strange things when, like you, we are forced to pass through the hands of the usurers."
"克莱昂特这事没指望了？","Cle. Then the affair won’t come off?"
"拉·弗莱什请原谅我。别人介绍来的中介人西蒙先生，是一个很活跃的热心人，他说他为你想尽了一切办法。他还说仅凭您的相貌就已经赢得了他的心。","La Fl. Excuse me; Mr. Simon, the broker who was recommended to us, is a very active and zealous fellow, and says he has left no stone unturned to help you.He assures me that your looks alone have won his heart."
"克莱昂特那我需要的一万五千法郎有着落了吗？","Cle. Shall I have the fifteen thousand francs which I want?"
"拉·弗莱什是的，不过要做成这买卖，您必须接受几个小小的条件。","La Fl. Yes, but under certain trifling conditions, which you must accept if you wish the bargain to be concluded."
"克莱昂特你直接和借钱人说上话了吗？","Cle. Did you speak to the man who is to lend the money?"
"拉·弗莱什噢！当然没有。事情不是那样办的。他比你还担心暴露自己的身份。这事比您想得隐秘多了。他的名字绝不会被泄露，而且由他来指定你们今天见面的地点，这样他就能直接从您本人这儿了解到您的经济地位和家庭背景，可我相信，就凭您父亲的大名，他准能把钱借给您。","La Fl. Oh! dear no. Things are not done in that way. He is still more anxious than you to remain unknown. These things are greater mysteries than you think. His name is not by any means to be divulged, and he is to be introduced to you to-day at a house provided by him, so that he may hear from yourself all about your position and your family; and I have not the least doubt that the mere name of your father will be sufficient to accomplish what you wish."
"克莱昂特特别是我的母亲去世后，她留给我的财产没人能拿走。","Cle. Particularly as my mother is dead, and they cannot deprive me of what I inherit from her."
"拉·弗莱什好的。这是他口述给中介人的一些条款，交易生效之前，需要您的同意。“假定放贷方对自己身份的隐瞒表示满意，借方的年纪符合，而且其家庭环境富裕、稳定、安全，没有任何负担，交易双方都同意在公证人的监督下，签订一份诚实无误的契约。考虑到放贷方更加关注契约的合理履行，该公证人由放贷方选定。”","La Fl. Well, here are some of the conditions which he has himself dictated to our go-between for you to take cognisance of, before anything is begun.“Supposing that the lender is satisfied with all his securities, and that the borrower is of age and of a family whose property is ample, solid, secure, and free from all incumbrances, there shall be drawn up a good and correct bond before as honest a notary as it is possible to find, and who for this purpose shall be chosen by the lender, because he is the more concerned of the two that the bond should be rightly executed.”"
"克莱昂特对这我没异议。","Cle. There is nothing to say against that."
"拉·弗莱什“放贷方不想让良心感到不安，决定借款的利息不超过百分之五点五。”","La Fl. “The lender, not to burden his conscience with the least scruple, does not wish to lend his money at more than five and a half per cent.”"
"克莱昂特百分之五点五？天啊，这很公平！我们没什么可抱怨的。","Cle. Five and a half per cent?By Jove, that’s honest!We have nothing to complain of."
"拉·弗莱什这倒是真的。“可是由于放贷方现款不足，所以，为了履行契约，放贷方本人向第三方借取，利息是百分之二十，由此借方也应承担这部分利息，因为这是放贷方为了借方才借款的。”","La Fl. That’s true.“But as the said lender has not in hand the sum required, and as, in order to oblige the borrower, he is himself obliged to borrow from another at the rate of twenty per cent., it is but right that the said first borrower shall pay this interest, without detriment to the rest; since it is only to oblige him that the said lender is himself forced to borrow.”"
"克莱昂特究竟在搞什么！好一个犹太人！好一个土耳其人！真让我们碰上了！这算下来比百分之二十五的利息还高呢。","Cle. The deuce!What a Jew! what a Turk we have here!That is more than twenty-five per cent."
"拉·弗莱什一点不假，我当时听到的反应也是这样。少爷，您还是要三思而后行啊。","La Fl. That’s true; and it is the remark I made. It is for you to consider the matter before you act."
"克莱昂特我还要怎么三思？我需要那笔钱，任何条件我都得答应。","Cle. How can I consider?I want the money, and I must therefore accept everything."
"拉·弗莱什这正是我给他的回复。","La Fl. That is exactly what I answered."
"克莱昂特还有其他条件吗？","Cle. Is there anything else?"
"拉·弗莱什还有一个小条件。“因为放贷方现款不足契约规定的一万五千法郎，只能付现一万两千法郎，所剩余的三千法郎，放贷方出于善意，以最低价格折算自己的动产、衣物、首饰等。现附清单如下——”","La Fl. Only a small item.“Of the fifteen thousand francs which are demanded, the lender will only be able to count down twelve thousand in hard cash; instead of the remaining three thousand, the borrower will have to take the chattels, clothing, and jewels, contained in the following catalogue, and which the said lender has put in all good faith at the lowest possible figure.”"
"克莱昂特这话是什么意思？","Cle. What is the meaning of all that?"
"拉·弗莱什我给您念念这清单：“一、一张四脚床，附带匈牙利风格花边的幔帐，橄榄色床褥一套，外加六只椅子和配套座套，这一整套毫无破损，还镶有红蓝两色闪光缎边。另：一副床帐，面料采用欧马耳浅粉色哗叽粗纺，缝有长短不一的丝绸须边。”","La Fl. I’ll go through the catalogue:—“Firstly:—A fourpost bedstead, with hangings of Hungary lace very elegantly trimmed with olive-coloured cloth, and six chairs and a counterpane to match; the whole in very good condition, and lined with soft red and blue shot-silk.Item:—the tester of good pale pink Aumale serge, with the small and the large fringes of silk.”"
"克莱昂特这东西拿给我做什么？","Cle. What does he want me to do with all this?"
"拉·弗莱什稍安勿躁。“另：一整套描写贡保与玛赛爱情生活的挂式花毯。另：一张胡桃木大桌，有十二根桌腿儿，两头均可拉伸，还配有六条小板凳。”","La Fl. Wait.“Item:—Tapestry hangings representing the loves of Gombaud and Macée.(1)Item:—A large walnut table with twelve columns or turned legs, which draws out at both ends, and is provided beneath with six stools.”"
"克莱昂特真见鬼！我能拿这些做什么？","Cle. Hang it all!What am I to do with all this?"
"拉·弗莱什别急别急。“另：三把嵌有珍珠母的火枪以及配套的架子。另：一个砖炉，其中有两个蒸馏器，三个受容器，这对蒸馏爱好者可是好东西。”","La Fl. Have patience.“Item:—Three large matchlocks inlaid with mother-of-pearl, with rests to correspond. Item:—A brick furnace with two retorts and three receivers, very useful to those who have any taste for distilling.”"
"克莱昂特这真要把我逼疯了。","Cle. You will drive me crazy."
"拉·弗莱什不要激动！“另：一把博洛尼亚产的琵琶，完好无损，几乎完好无损。另：一张球桌，一只棋盘，以及从古希腊人流传下来的鹅图游戏，这些都是闲暇无聊之时打发时间的好东西。另：一张蜥蜴皮，长三英尺半，内填有干草，悬挂于天花板上，赏心悦目。上述所有物品，合理价值总和超过四千五百法郎，但出于放贷方的好心，抵现价一千克朗。”","La Fl. Gently!“Item:—A Bologna lute with all its strings, or nearly all. Item:—A pigeon-hole table and a draught-board, and a game of mother goose, restored from the Greeks, most useful to pass the time when one has nothing to do. Item:—A lizard’s skin, three feet and a half in length, stuffed with hay, a pleasing curiosity to hang on the ceiling of a room. The whole of the above-mentioned articles are really worth more than four thousand five hundred francs, and are reduced to the value of a thousand crowns through the considerateness of the lender.”"
"克莱昂特让他的好心见鬼去吧，这卑鄙之徒，他就是刽子手！哪有这样无理的高利贷？难道让我接受那高得离谱的利息都不能让他如意，还强迫我接收这一堆他收拾出来的破烂，还说值三千法郎。就算全部变卖掉，我也得不到两百克朗，即使这样我还是必须同意他的条件，因为他明白这时的我没有资格谈条件。这个恶棍，他简直要了我的命。","Cle. Let the plague choke him with his considerateness, the wretch, the cut-throat that he is!Did ever anyone hear of such usury?Is he not satisfied with the outrageous interest he asks that he must force me to take, instead of the three thousand francs, all the old rubbish which he picks up.I shan’t get two hundred crowns for all that, and yet I must bring myself to yield to all his wishes; for he is in a position to force me to accept everything, and he has me, the villain, with a knife at my throat."
"拉·弗莱什少爷，可别怪我多嘴，我看到您现在的处境，就像巴汝奇(拉伯雷著作《巨人传》里的角色)一样，一步一步走向破产——预先借款，被迫高价买进，低价售出，得不偿失啊。","La Fl. I see you, Sir, if you’ll forgive my saying so, on the high-road followed by Panurge(2) to ruin himself—taking money in advance, buying dear, selling cheap, and cutting your corn while it is still grass."
"克莱昂特你要我怎么办？这都是吝啬的父亲把儿子逼到这种地步，这也怪不得当儿子的盼着父亲早点死。","Cle. What would you have me do?It is to this that young men are reduced by the accursed avarice of their fathers; and people are astonished after that, that sons long for their death."
"拉·弗莱什遇见您父亲这样吝啬的人，再有修养的君子都会忍不住动怒的。感谢老天爷，我从不想被绞死，可我的同行们就爱做些偷鸡摸狗的坏事儿，而我非常清楚自己要远离那些让人暴富的小把戏，不会去趟这趟浑水，以免断送小命。可是，说真的，老爷的所作所为，让我真想偷走他什么东西，而且我也认为，这样做简直是为世人造福。","La Fl. No one can deny that yours would excite against his meanness the most quiet of men. I have not, thank God, any inclination gallows-ward, and among my colleagues whom I see dabbling in various doubtful affairs, I know well enough how to keep myself out of hot water, and how to keep clear of all those things which savour ever so little of the ladder; but to tell you the truth, he almost gives me, by his ways of going on, the desire of robbing him, and I should think that in doing so I was doing a meritorious action."
"克莱昂特把那清单给我，我得好好瞧瞧。","Cle. Give me that memorandum that I may have another look at it."
"第二场——阿巴贡，西蒙先生（克莱昂特与拉·弗莱什在舞台后面）","SCENE II.——HARPAGON, MR. SIMON (CLÉANTE and LA FLÈCHE at the back of the stage)."
"西蒙先生是的，先生，是一位年轻人需要这笔钱，而且很急切，无论您提出什么条件他都会接受。","Sim. Yes, Sir; it is a young man who is greatly in want of money; his affairs force him to find some at any cost, and he will submit to all your conditions."
"阿巴贡可是，西蒙先生，这笔买卖没有任何风险吗？您都了解这个人的姓名、财产和他家庭状况吗？","Har. But are you sure, Mr. Simon, that there is no risk to run in this case? and do you know the name, the property, and the family of him for whom you speak?"
"西蒙先生不，我还无法向您说清楚，因为他是我偶然听人介绍认识的。不过他本人可以当面跟您说清楚，而且他的仆人已保证，您知道他的身份后，会非常满意这笔交易的。现在我所能告诉您的就是，他的家庭条件相当富裕，而且他母亲已不在了。他还担保，只要您愿意，他的父亲活不过八个月了。","Sim. No; I cannot tell you anything for certain, as it was by mere chance that I was made acquainted with him; but he will tell you everything himself, and his servant has assured me that you will be quite satisfied when you know who he is. All I can tell you is that his family is said to be very wealthy, that he has already lost his mother, and that he will pledge you his word, if you insist upon it, that his father will die before eight months are passed."
"阿巴贡那太好了。西蒙先生，我认为在我们力所能及的时候，我们应该行善积德帮助别人。","Har. That is something. Charity, Mr. Simon, demands of us to gratify people whenever we have it in our power."
"西蒙先生这是当然。","Sim. Evidently."
"拉·弗莱什（辨认出西蒙先生，对克莱昂特低语）这是怎么回事？西蒙先生正在跟您父亲谈话！","La Fl. (aside to Cléante, on recognising Mr. Simon). What does this mean?Mr. Simon talking with your father!"
"克莱昂特（对拉·弗莱什低语）难道他知道我的身份了？你怎么可以这样出卖我？","Cle. (aside to La Flèche). Has he been told who I am, and would you be capable of betraying me?"
"西蒙先生（对着克莱昂特和拉·弗莱什）啊！你们来得真是时候！谁告诉你们在这儿见面的？（对阿巴贡）我肯定没有透露给他们您的姓名和住址，不过我认为这也没什么大碍，他们值得信任，而且你们可以在一起协商达成共识。","Sim. (to Cléante and La Flèche). Ah! you are in good time!But who told you to come here?(To Harpagon) It was certainly not I who told them your name and address; but I am of opinion that there is no great harm done; they are people who can be trusted, and you can come to some understanding together."
"阿巴贡什么！","Har. What!"
"西蒙先生（介绍克莱昂特给阿巴贡）这就是向您借一万五千法郎的年轻人。","Sim. (showing Cléante). This is the gentleman who wants to borrow the fifteen thousand francs of which I have spoken to you."
"阿巴贡什么！无赖！那个不可救药的家伙竟然是你？","Har. What! miscreant! is it you who abandon yourself to such excesses?"
"克莱昂特什么！父亲！那个赚黑心钱的人竟然是您？","Cle. What! father! is it you who stoop to such shameful deeds?"
"（西蒙先生见状离开，拉·弗莱什也躲了起来。）","(M. Simon runs away, and La Flèche hides himself.)"
"第三场——阿巴贡，克莱昂特。","SCENE III.——HARPAGON, CLÉANTE."
"阿巴贡原来借此厚债、糟蹋名誉的人是你啊！","Har. It is you who are ruining yourself by loans so greatly to be condemned!"
"克莱昂特所以，靠这罪恶的高利贷发财的就是您啊！","Cle. So it is you who seek to enrich yourself by such criminal usury!"
"阿巴贡做出这种事，你还敢出现在我面前？","Har. And you dare, after that, to show yourself before me?"
"克莱昂特做出这种事，您还有脸见人吗？","Cle. And you dare, after that, to show yourself to the world?"
"阿巴贡告诉我，你挥金如土，没有分寸、不知羞耻地挥霍掉父母用汗水挣得的财富，就一点都不觉得羞愧吗？","Har. Are you not ashamed, tell me, to descend to these wild excesses, to rush headlong into frightful expenses, and disgracefully to dissipate the wealth which your parents have amassed with so much toil."
"克莱昂特那么您做出这种勾当败坏自己的地位，用荣誉和名声为代价来满足您积攒钱财的愿望，您用最出名的高利贷主也想不到的无耻伎俩聚敛财富，难道就不觉得脸红吗？","Cle. Are you not ashamed of dishonouring your station by such dealings, of sacrificing honour and reputation to the insatiable desire of heaping crown upon crown, and of outdoing the most infamous devices that have ever been invented by the most notorious usurers?"
"阿巴贡快滚开，你这无赖，我不想再看到你！","Har. Get out of my sight, you reprobate; get out of my sight!"
"克莱昂特依您看谁的罪过最大：是需要钱而向别人借钱的人，还是不需要钱而利用不法手段去获取钱财的人？","Cle. Who is the more criminal in your opinion: he who buys the money of which he stands in need, or he who obtains, by unfair means, money for which he has no use?"
"阿巴贡我说了，快滚开，别惹我发火。（自言自语）我对这件事情并不生气，毕竟，这对我是个警告，以后我对他的一举一动要格外注意了。","Har. Begone, I say, and do not provoke me to anger.(Alone) After all, I am not very much vexed at this adventure; it will be a lesson to me to keep a better watch over all his doings."
"第四场——弗罗辛娜，阿巴贡。","SCENE IV.——FROSINE, HARPAGON."
"弗罗辛娜先生。","Fro. Sir."
"阿巴贡请等一下，我马上就回来，再跟你说话。（旁白）我最好先去瞧瞧我的钱。","Har. Wait a moment, I will come back and speak to you. (Aside) I had better go and see a little after my money."
"第五场——拉·弗莱什，弗罗辛娜。","SCENE V.——LA FLÈCHE, FROSINE."
"拉·弗莱什（没有注意到弗罗辛娜）这件事可太荒谬了。清单上的那些玩意儿我们谁都没见过，他一定有个不为人知的大仓库，把他那些玩意儿藏得严严实实的。","La Fl. (without seeing Frosine). The adventure is most comical. Hidden somewhere he must have a large store of goods of all kinds, for the list did not contain one single article which either of us recognised."
"弗罗辛娜啊！是你吗，我可怜的拉·弗莱什？怎么会在这儿遇见你？","Fro. Hallo! is it you, my poor La Flèche?How is it we meet here?"
"拉·弗莱什啊！啊！是你，弗罗辛娜，你来这里干什么？","La Fl. Ah! ah! it is you, Frosine; and what have you come to do here?"
"弗罗辛娜我来这里做什么？嗨！我只是到处走走，为了别人的婚事操心，也算是对社会贡献自己的一份力量，当然同时也不忘靠自己的小才干从中赚点小钱。在世上没点智慧还怎么活下去？像我这样的人，除了有点小诡计和小聪明外，还有什么优势可言？","Fro. What have I come to do?Why! what I do everywhere else, busy myself about other people’s affairs, make myself useful to the community in general, and profit as much as I possibly can by the small talent I possess. Must we not live by our wits in this world? and what other resources have people like me but intrigue and cunning?"
"拉·弗莱什那你正跟这家主人谈事？","La Fl. Have you, then, any business with the master of this house?"
"弗罗辛娜是的，我正在为他办一件小事，他说他一定会给我酬劳。","Fro. Yes. I am transacting for him a certain small matter for which he is pretty sure to give me a reward."
"拉·弗莱什他能给你酬劳！啊！啊！恕我直言，如果你能从他那里得到什么，那你太了不起了。我告诉你，这儿的钱可不是那么容易赚的。","La Fl. He give you a reward!Ah! ah!Upon my word, you will be ‘cute if you ever get one, and I warn you that ready money is very scarce hereabouts."
"弗罗辛娜也许不假，但是有些事情帮帮忙是能感动人的。","Fro. That may be, but there are certain services which wonderfully touch our feelings."
"拉·弗莱什敬爱的弗罗辛娜，可你还不了解阿巴贡老爷。阿巴贡是人类中最没有人性的人，是人世间心肠最硬、最吝啬的人。再贴心的服侍也别想让他掏腰包。如果你确实渴望得到一点奖励、尊敬、善意和友谊，那很容易做到。可是钱，那就另当别论了。就连他的问候和礼貌都是世上最枯燥无味的，而且“给予”是他最厌恶的字眼，他从不说给予你问候，而是借给你问候。","La Fl. Your humble servant; but as yet you don’t know Harpagon. Harpagon is the human being of all human beings the least humane, the mortal of all mortals the hardest and closest.There is no service great enough to induce him to open his purse.If, indeed, you want praise, esteem, kindness, and friendship, you are welcome to any amount; but money, that’s a different affair. There is nothing more dry, more barren, than his favour and his good grace, and “give” is a word for which he has such a strong dislike that he never says I give, but I lend, you a good morning."
"弗罗辛娜这实在太好了，但是我知道怎么从这种人身上获取钱财。我知道怎么敞开他们的心房，找到他们的弱点，然后触动他们的心灵。","Fro. That’s all very well; but I know the art of fleecing men. I have a secret of touching their affections by flattering their hearts, and of finding out their weak points."
"拉·弗莱什在他身上都没用。我敢跟你打赌，只要在钱的方面，你打动不了他的心肠。他对钱就像一个土耳其人，那股子吝啬能把你逼疯了，他能站在一旁眼睁睁地看你饿死过去，而且就算遇到乞丐，他也不会伸手帮一把。一句话，他爱钱胜过名誉、声望和道德。他一看到向他要钱的人，就像受到了致命的打击一样，就好像挖走了他的心头肉、掏走了他的五脏六腑一样！而且如果……可他回来了，我得走了。","La Fl. All useless here. I defy you to soften, as far as money is concerned, the man we are speaking of.He is a Turk on that point, of a Turkishness to drive anyone to despair, and we might starve in his presence and never a peg would he stir.In short, he loves money better than reputation, honour, and virtue, and the mere sight of anyone making demands upon his purse sends him into convulsions; it is like striking him in a vital place, it is piercing him to the heart, it is like tearing out his very bowels!And if … But here he comes again; I leave you."
"第六场——阿巴贡，弗罗辛娜。","SCENE VI.——HARPAGON, FROSINE."
"阿巴贡（旁白）一切都是原来的样子。（对弗罗辛娜）好了，弗罗辛娜，有什么事？","Har. (aside). All is as it should be. (To Frosine) Well, what is it, Frosine?"
"弗罗辛娜噢，上帝，您看起来气色真好！身体也非常健康。","Fro. Bless me, how well you look!You are the very picture of health."
"阿巴贡谁？我？","Har. Who?I?"
"弗罗辛娜我从没见过您这么神采奕奕，精神饱满。","Fro. Never have I seen you looking more rosy, more hearty."
"阿巴贡你说的是实话？","Har. Are you in earnest?"
"弗罗辛娜当然啦！您一辈子都没像现在这么年轻，而且我看有些二十五岁的年轻小伙都比您显老。","Fro. Why!you have never been so young in your life; and I know many a man of twenty-five who looks much older than you do."
"阿巴贡不过，弗罗辛娜，我可都过六十了。","Har. And yet, Frosine, I have passed threescore."
"弗罗辛娜六十！那算什么？您难道想在这数字上找麻烦吗？现在正是一个人的大好年华呀，是进入了人生最美好的时期。","Fro. Threescore!Well, and what then?You don’t mean to make a trouble of that, do you?It’s the very flower of manhood, the threshold of the prime of life."
"阿巴贡是这样。不过我想再年轻二十岁也没坏处。","Har. True; but twenty years less would do me no harm, I think."
"弗罗辛娜胡说！您根本不需要，而且您这身子骨儿能活到一百岁。","Fro. Nonsense!You’ve no need of that, and you are of a build to last out a hundred."
"阿巴贡你真的这么认为？","Har. Do you really think so?"
"弗罗辛娜毫无疑问。您的模样一看就是个寿星。站直一点。啊！看您双眼之间竖直而下的线条，就预示着您能长命百岁。","Fro. Decidedly. You have all the appearance of it. Hold yourself up a little. Ah! what a sign of long life is that line there straight between your two eyes!"
"阿巴贡真的？你懂这些？","Har. You know all about that, do you?"
"弗罗辛娜我的确懂。伸出您的手(弗罗辛娜懂得看手相)。哦，我的天，多好的生命线啊！","Fro. I should think I do. Show me your hand. (Frosine professes a knowledge of palmistry.) Dear me, what a line of life there is there!"
"阿巴贡哪里？","Har. Where?"
"弗罗辛娜您没看到这条生命线延伸到很远吗？","Fro. Don’t you see how far this line goes?"
"阿巴贡是的，那又代表什么？","Har. Well, and what does it mean?"
"弗罗辛娜代表什么？您看……我刚才说能活到一百岁，但不，我应该说能活到一百二十岁。","Fro. What does it mean?There … I said a hundred years; but no, it is one hundred and twenty I ought to have said."
"阿巴贡这可能吗？","Har. Is it possible?"
"弗罗辛娜我告诉您，您会活到为自己的孩子，孩子的孩子去送终，除非有人杀了您。","Fro. I tell you they will have to kill you, and you will bury your children and your children’s children."
"阿巴贡这太好了！我们的事情怎么样了？","Har. So much the better!And what news of our affair?"
"弗罗辛娜那还用问吗？由我插手还有办不成的事情？尤其是牵线说媒这种事，我最拿手了。这世上没有我说不成的亲事，而且我相信，只要我愿意，甚至能把土耳其和威尼斯共和国结成亲家。(它们是古时的仇敌。在1669年，经过二十年的战争，土耳其国从威尼斯国那里夺走干地亚。)而且我确信，这件事远没有那么棘手。况且我和她们家本来就有来往，我向她们母女谈了您的事情，而且我也告诉她的母亲，当您看到玛丽安娜从街上走过，看见她在窗户那儿透气的片刻便决定娶她为妻了。","Fro. Is there any need to ask?Did ever anyone see me begin anything and not succeed in it?I have, especially for matchmaking, the most wonderful talent. There are no two persons in the world I could not couple together; and I believe that, if I took it into my head, I could make the Grand Turk marry the Republic of Venice. (Old enemies. The Turks took Candia from the Venetians in 1669, after a war of twenty years.)But we had, to be sure, no such difficult thing to achieve in this matter. As I know the ladies very well, I told them every particular about you; and I acquainted the mother with your intentions towards Marianne since you saw her pass in the street and enjoy the fresh air out of her window."
"阿巴贡那她回应说……？","Har. What did she answer…?"
"弗罗辛娜她非常欣喜地接受了您的提亲。还有，当我告诉她，您希望她女儿能够参加今晚为您女儿举办的订婚仪式时，她爽快答应了，并委托我照顾她的女儿。","Fro. She received your proposal with great joy; and when I told her that you wished very much that her daughter should come to-night to assist at the marriage contract which is to be signed for your own daughter, she assented at once, and entrusted her to me for the purpose."
"阿巴贡你看，弗罗辛娜，我得为安塞尔姆先生准备点晚餐，我希望她也能光临，共进晚餐。","Har. You see, Frosine, I am obliged to give some supper to Mr. Anselme, and I should like her to have a share in the feast."
"弗罗辛娜您说得太对了。玛丽安娜会在午餐后来探望您的女儿，然后去集市逛逛，再准时在晚餐时间回来。","Fro. You are quite right. She is to come after dinner to pay a visit to your daughter; then she means to go from here to the fair, and return to your house just in time for supper."
"阿巴贡这真是太棒了！她们可以一起坐我的马车去集市，我很乐意借给她们。","Har. That will do very well; they shall go together in my carriage, which I will lend them."
"弗罗辛娜这样安排真是完美。","Fro. That will suit her perfectly."
"阿巴贡可我得说，弗罗辛娜，你有没有向她母亲提到嫁妆的事？你有没有跟她说，在这种情况下，她应该尽最大努力，出一点血？因为，毕竟没人愿意娶一个不带嫁妆的女儿。","Har. But I say, Frosine, have you spoken to the mother about the dowry she can give her daughter?Did you make her understand that under such circumstances she ought to do her utmost and to make a great sacrifice?For, after all, one does not marry a girl without her bringing something with her."
"弗罗辛娜什么呀！这个姑娘她会每年给您带来整整一万两千法郎。","Fro. How something!She is a girl who will bring you a clear twelve thousand francs a year?"
"阿巴贡每年一万两千法郎？","Har. Twelve thousand francs a year?"
"弗罗辛娜是的！首先，她是在及其严格的节俭观念中长大的。她习惯了简单的食谱，只吃沙拉、牛奶、干酪和苹果，而且既不需要讲究的餐桌食具，也不需要任何食材丰富的肉汤，或者养颜护肤的大麦茶。简而言之，其他女人渴望的精致小吃她都不需要。这些东西得花费不少钱，算起来每年得用去三千法郎。另外，她只想要干净和朴素的衣服，她不喜欢华丽的衣裙，昂贵的珠宝，或者豪华的家具，这都是别的女人喜欢的，而这笔账算下来每年得花掉四千多法郎。最后一点，她最痛恨的事情就是赌博，这在现在的女人中可是不多见的。为何这么说，因为我认识的一个邻居，今年就在这里面栽进去至少两万法郎。这里我们就按照四分之一来计算。每年五千法郎的赌资，加上四千法郎的衣裙和珠宝，再加上三千法郎的食物，这不就是一万两千法郎吗？","Fro. Yes!To begin with, she has been nursed and brought up with the strictest notions of frugality. She is a girl accustomed to live upon salad, milk, cheese, and apples, and who consequently will require neither a well served up table, nor any rich broth, nor your everlasting peeled barley; none, in short, of all those delicacies that another woman would want.This is no small matter, and may well amount to three thousand francs yearly. Besides this, she only cares for simplicity and neatness; she will have none of those splendid dresses and rich jewels, none of that sumptuous furniture in which girls like her indulge so extravagantly; and this item is worth more than four thousand francs per annum. Lastly, she has the deepest aversion to gambling; and this is not very common nowadays among women. Why, I know of one in our neighbourhood who lost at least twenty thousand francs this year.But let us reckon only a fourth of that sum. Five thousand francs a year at play and four thousand in clothes and jewels make nine thousand; and three thousand francs which we count for food, does it not make your twelve thousand francs?"
"阿巴贡是，是不错，可是，这笔账没有实在的东西啊。","Har. Yes, that’s not bad; but, after all, that calculation has nothing real in it."
"弗罗辛娜请原谅。一场婚姻能带给您节俭的美德，对朴素衣服的热衷，以及对赌博的深恶痛绝，这难道不是实在的东西？","Fro. Excuse me; is it nothing real to bring you in marriage a great sobriety, to inherit a great love for simplicity in dress, and the acquired property of a great hatred for gambling?"
"阿巴贡你把她以后节省的开支算作嫁妆，这是在开玩笑吧。我没得到实在的东西是不会打收条的，而且我必须得到些东西。","Har. It is a farce to pretend to make up a dowry with all the expenses she will not run into. I could not give a receipt for what I do not receive; and I must decidedly get something."
"弗罗辛娜上天保佑！您会得到的。她们对我提过一个地方，她们在那儿有一笔财产，您迟早都是它的主人。","Fro. Bless me! you will get enough; and they have spoken to me of a certain country where they have some property, of which you will be master."
"阿巴贡我要亲眼看到才算数。但是，弗罗辛娜，还有一件事让我不安心。你知道，这女孩还年轻，一般年轻人都只喜欢年纪相仿的人，只关心年轻人的事情。我担心我这把年纪的男人也许不符合她的要求，这就会在我家里引起一些麻烦，我不喜欢这样。","Har. We shall have to see to that. But, Frosine, there is one more thing that makes me uneasy.The girl is young, you know; and young people generally like those who are young like themselves, and only care for the society of the young.I am afraid that a man of my age may not exactly suit her taste, and that this may occasion in my family certain complications that would in nowise be pleasant to me."
"弗罗辛娜哦，您对她还很不了解！这也是我特别要告诉您的。她非常讨厌跟她一般年纪的男孩子，她只喜欢老年人。","Fro. Oh, how badly you judge her!This is one more peculiarity of which I had to speak to you. She has the greatest detestation to all young men, and only likes old people."
"阿巴贡她真这样？","Har. Does she?"
"弗罗辛娜我真希望您能亲耳听到她这么说。她忍受不了看见年轻的小伙，她说如果是一个长着大胡子的英俊老头的话，她再开心不过了。对她而言，越老越可爱，而且我可提醒您，别想着把自己打扮得年轻点。她希望对方的年纪至少有六十岁。而且就在半年前，眼看着婚期临近，她突然终止了婚约，就因为她得知对方只有五十六岁，而且不戴眼镜，于是就断然拒婚。","Fro. I should like you to hear her talk on that subject; she cannot bear at all the sight of a young man, and nothing delights her more than to see a fine old man with a venerable beard. The oldest are to her the most charming, and I warn you beforehand not to go and make yourself any younger than you really are. She wishes for one sixty years old at least; and it is not more than six months ago that on the very eve of being married she suddenly broke off the match on learning that her lover was only fifty-six years of age, and did not put on spectacles to sign the contract."
"阿巴贡就因为这个？","Har. Only for that?"
"弗罗辛娜是的。她还说她不喜欢五十六岁的男人，而且她特别喜欢戴着眼镜的老人。","Fro. Yes; she says there is no pleasure with a man of fifty-six; and she has a decided affection for those who wear spectacles."
"阿巴贡这事对我来说太新鲜了。","Har. Well, this is quite new to me."
"弗罗辛娜还有更新鲜的事情要说呢。在她房间里放着一些油画和版画，您知道上面都是什么吗？阿多尼斯？刻法罗斯？帕里斯？还是阿波罗？都不是！是萨图努斯、普里阿摩斯君王、内斯特长老，还有被儿子背着的安喀塞斯的肖像。","Fro. No one can imagine how far she carries this. She has in her room a few pictures and engravings, and what do you imagine they are?An Adonis, a Cephalus, a Paris, an Apollo?Not a bit of it!Fine portraits of Saturn, of King Priam, of old Nestor, and of good father Anchises on his son’s shoulders."
"阿巴贡这太妙了。我从未想过会有这等事。我很乐意听到她对男人有这样的喜好。事实上，我要是个女性，我也不会喜欢那些年轻的小伙。","Har. That’s admirable. I should never have guessed such a thing; and I am very pleased to hear that she has such taste as this. Indeed had I been a woman, I should never have loved young fellows."
"弗罗辛娜我同意。年轻小伙们中看不中用，不值得去爱。要女人去追求一些油腔滑调、乳臭未干的年轻人，真不知道这样做有什么意义。","Fro. I should think not. Fine trumpery indeed, these young men, for any one to fall in love with. Fine jackanapes and puppies for a woman to hanker after. I should like to know what relish anyone can find in them?"
"阿巴贡就是，我就不懂，想不通为何有些女性那么喜欢年轻的男人。","Har. Truly; I don’t understand it myself, and I cannot make out how it is that some women dote so on them."
"弗罗辛娜她们绝对是头脑发昏了。觉得年轻人可爱这能算是明白事理吗？那些卷发的花花公子算是真正的男人吗？这样的蠢家伙值得去爱吗？","Fro. They must be downright idiots. Can any one be in his senses who thinks youth amiable?Can those curly-pated coxcombs be men, and can one really get attached to such animals?"
"阿巴贡这就是我每天在说的事！他们的嗓音女里女气的，三根卷起的胡须像猫胡须一样，还戴着粗麻做的假发，穿着裤腿肥大的马裤和那袒露胸膛的衬衣！","Har. Exactly what I say every day!With their effeminate voices, their three little bits of a beard turned up like cat’s whiskers, their tow wigs, their flowing breeches and open breasts!"
"弗罗辛娜是呀，您和他们真是鲜明的对比。在您身上，我们才能看到男人的气概，这足以让人满意了。因此只有像您这样的体格和穿着才能招人喜欢。","Fro. Yes; they are famous guys compared with yourself. In you we see something like a man. There is enough to satisfy the eye. It is thus that one should be made and dressed to inspire love."
"阿巴贡所以你觉得我真的很不错？","Har. Then you think I am pretty well?"
"弗罗辛娜相当不错！我真的这么认为。您的魅力，再加上您的相貌，就像是一幅美丽的图画。请您转一下身。没人能找到比您更优秀的了。让我看看您走路。您的身材笔直、灵活、潇洒，好极了，找不到一点毛病。","Fro. Pretty well!I should think so; you are charming, and your face would make a beautiful picture.Turn round a little, if you please. You could not find anything better anywhere. Let me see you walk.You have a well-shaped body, free and easy, as it should be, and one which gives no sign of infirmity."
"阿巴贡我也很感恩地说，自己没找出什么毛病。只是我这时不时的咳嗽，老是不好。","Har. I have nothing the matter to speak of, I am thankful to say. It is only my cough, which returns from time to time."
"弗罗辛娜这没什么大碍，咳嗽只会让您更有魅力。","Fro. That is nothing, and coughing becomes you exceedingly well."
"阿巴贡告诉我，弗罗辛娜，玛丽安娜见过我吗？当我们擦身而过时她注意到我了吗？","Har. Tell me, Frosine, has Marianne seen me yet?Has she not noticed me when I passed by?"
"弗罗辛娜没有，但是我们的谈话大都是关于您。我如实向她描述了您的情况，我也充分强调了您的优点，让她知道能有一个您这样的丈夫是绝对有利的。","Fro. No; but we have had many conversations about you. I gave her an exact description of your person, and I did not fail to make the most of your merit, and to show her what an advantage it would be to have a husband like you."
"阿巴贡你做得对，对此我非常感谢。","Har. You did right, and I thank you very much for it."
"弗罗辛娜先生，我对您有一个小小的请求。我正在打官司，眼看要输了，需要点钱（阿巴贡脸色阴沉下来），这对您来说是举手之劳，您就可怜可怜我吧。您无法想象玛丽安娜有多么高兴能见到您。（阿巴贡脸色又明亮起来。）哦！她一定会喜欢您的，看您那老式的白色皱领，一定会对她产生奇妙的效果。但是，她尤其会欣赏您用绳子把裤子和上衣拴在一起的衣着，这会让她迷恋上您，因为佩戴绳子的男人她最喜欢了。","Fro. I have, Sir, a small request to make to you.I am in danger of losing a lawsuit for want of a little money (Harpagon looks grave), and you can easily help me with it, if you have pity upon me.You cannot imagine how happy she will be to see you. (Harpagon looks joyful.) Oh! how sure you are to please her, and how sure that antique ruff of yours is to produce a wonderful effect on her mind. But, above all, she will be delighted with your breeches fastened to your doublet with tags; that will make her mad after you, and a lover who wears tags will be most welcome to her."
"阿巴贡你说得我高兴得不知如何是好了，弗罗辛娜。","Har. You send me into raptures, Frosine, by saying that."
"弗罗辛娜老爷，我没一句假话。这场官司对我来说至关重要。（阿巴贡脸色又严肃起来。）如果我败诉了，我会破产的，但是一小笔钱就能挽救回来。我真希望您能看到我提起您时她脸上的笑容。（阿巴贡的脸色又转晴了。）当我告诉她您所有的优点时，她眼睛里闪烁着喜悦的光芒。简而言之，因为我，她迫切地期待这桩婚事。","Fro. I tell you the truth, Sir; this lawsuit is of the utmost importance for me. (Harpagon looks serious again.) If I lose it, I am for ever ruined; but a very small sum will save me.I should like you to have seen the happiness she felt when I spoke of you to her. (Harpagon looks pleased again.)Joy sparkled in her eyes while I told her of all your good qualities; and I succeeded, in short, in making her look forward with the greatest impatience to the conclusion of the match."
"阿巴贡你真是太让我高兴了，弗罗辛娜，我保证你……","Har. You have given me great pleasure, Frosine, and I assure you I …"
"弗罗辛娜我求您了，老爷，就好心帮我这一回吧。（阿巴贡的脸色再一次阴沉下来。）这会让我走出困境，我也会永远感激您。","Fro. I beg of you, Sir, to grant me the little assistance I ask of you. (Harpagon again looks grave.) It will put me on my feet again, and I shall feel grateful to you for ever."
"阿巴贡再见了，我必须走，我得回去写信。","Har. Good-bye; I must go and finish my correspondence."
"弗罗辛娜我向您保证，老爷，我真的是逼不得已才来寻求您的援助啊。","Fro. I assure you, Sir, that you could not help me in a more pressing necessity."
"阿巴贡我会安排好我的马车，待会儿你们好去集市。","Har. I will see that my carriage is ready to take you to the fair."
"弗罗辛娜如果不是迫不得已，我也不会在此强烈恳求您了。","Fro. I would not importune you so if I were not compelled by necessity."
"阿巴贡而且我会把晚餐提前，这样对大家都好。","Har. And I will see that we have supper early, so that nobody may be ill."
"弗罗辛娜别拒绝我的请求，我求您。您绝对不能设想，老爷，我有多高兴……","Fro. Do not refuse me the service; I beg of you. You can hardly believe, Sir, the pleasure that …"
"阿巴贡我得走了，有人在叫我。我们不久以后会再见的。","Har. I must go; somebody is calling me. We shall see each other again by and by."
"弗罗辛娜（一个人）但愿你被热病活活折磨死，卑鄙无耻的铁公鸡，然后把你送到魔鬼那儿去！这吝啬鬼对我的哀求完全无视，但是我绝不妥协，因为我还有办法，到时，无论如何，我都要拿到一笔丰厚的报酬。","Fro. (alone). May the fever seize you, you stingy cur, and send you to the devil and his angels!The miser has held out against all my attacks; but I must not drop the negotiation; for I have the other side, and there, at all events, I am sure of a good reward."
"第三幕","ACT III."
"第一场——阿巴贡，克莱昂特，埃莉斯，瓦莱尔，克洛德夫人（手拿扫帚），雅克师傅，拉·梅吕什，布兰达瓦纳。","SCENE I.——HARPAGON, CLÉANTE, ÉLISE, VALÈRE, DAME CLAUDE (holding a broom), MASTER JACQUES, LA MERLUCHE, BRINDAVOINE."
"阿巴贡来，所有人到这儿来，我得给你们吩咐任务，挨个儿安排你们需要办的事。过来，克洛德夫人，从你开始。（盯着她手中的扫帚。）很好，我看出来你已经准备好了。我就把这清洁工作全权交给你了，不过，擦家具时要尤其小心点，免得把家具磨坏了。除此之外，吃晚餐的时候我派你看管这些瓶子，要是有一个丢失，或者磕了、破了的话，都要拿你是问，还要从你的工资里直接扣去。","Har. Here, come here, all of you; I must give you orders for by and by, and arrange what each one will have to do. Come nearer, Dame Claude; let us begin with you. (Looking at her broom.) Good; you are ready armed, I see.To you I commit the care of cleaning up everywhere; but, above all, be very careful not to rub the furniture too hard, for fear of wearing it out.Besides this, I put the bottles under your care during supper, and if any one of them is missing, or if anything gets broken, you will be responsible for it, and pay it out of your wages."
"雅克师傅（旁白）真是个精明的处罚。","Jac. (aside). A shrewd punishment that."
"阿巴贡（对克洛德夫人）现在你可以去干活了。","Har. (to Dame Claude.) Now you may go."
"第二场——阿巴贡，克莱昂特，埃莉斯，瓦莱尔，雅克师傅，布兰达瓦纳，拉·梅吕什。","SCENE II.——HARPAGON, CLÉANTE, ÉLISE, VALÈRE, MASTER JACQUES, BRINDAVOINE, LA MERLUCHE."
"阿巴贡至于你，布兰达瓦纳，还有你，拉·梅吕什，你们负责擦拭酒杯，以及给客人斟酒，但只在客人口渴的时候才倒酒，别跟着其他不懂规矩的马屁精学，劝客人喝酒，甚至是客人没想喝酒的时候也一个劲儿地劝。必须等到客人要求多次以后才能倒酒，而且之前要记得掺够水。","Har. To you, Brindavoine, and to you, La Merluche, belongs the duty of washing the glasses, and of giving to drink, but only when people are thirsty, and not according to the custom of certain impertinent lackeys, who urge them to drink, and put the idea into their heads when they are not thinking about it. Wait until you have been asked several times, and remember always to have plenty of water."
"雅克师傅（旁白）是呀，这酒要不加水可容易上头。","Jac. (aside). Yes; wine without water gets into one’s head."
"拉·梅吕什老爷，那我们需要脱掉工作服吗？","La Mer. Shall we take off our smocks, Sir?"
"阿巴贡当然，等客人到了后才脱掉，但是记住了，小心点，别把衣服弄脏了。","Har. Yes, when you see the guests coming; but be very careful not to spoil your clothes."
"布兰达瓦纳您知道，老爷，我上衣前面已经沾了一大团灯油渍。","Brind. You know, Sir, that one of the fronts of my doublet is covered with a large stain of oil from the lamp."
"拉·梅吕什而且，老爷，我的裤子后面全是窟窿，所以，恕我冒昧……","La Mer. And I, Sir, that my breeches are all torn behind, and that, saving your presence …"
"阿巴贡（对着拉·梅吕什）安静！那就老老实实背对着墙壁，一直面对客人。（对着布兰达瓦纳，取下他的帽子，比划着用帽子遮住衣服上的污渍）至于你，服侍客人的时候就一直这样拿着帽子。","Har. (to La Merluche). Peace!Turn carefully towards the wall, and always face the company. (To Brindavoine, showing him how he is to hold his hat before his doublet, to hide the stain of oil) And you, always hold your hat in this fashion when you wait on the guests."
"第三场——阿巴贡，克莱昂特，埃莉斯，雅克师傅。","SCENE III.——HARPAGON, CLÉANTE, ÉLISE, VALÈRE, MASTER JACQUES."
"阿巴贡至于你，我的女儿，你就紧紧盯住那些撤离餐桌的食物，当心不要给糟蹋了。这种差事最适合你们这些年轻女孩子来做了。同时，你还要准备好接见我心爱的姑娘，今天下午她会来拜访你，然后和你一起去集市逛逛。你懂我的意思？","Har. As for you, my daughter, you will look after all that is cleared off the table, and see that nothing is wasted: this care is very becoming to young girls. Meanwhile get ready to welcome my lady-love, who is coming this afternoon to pay you a visit, and will take you off to the fair with her. Do you understand what I say?"
"埃莉斯完全明白，父亲。","Eli. Yes, father."
"第四场——阿巴贡，克莱昂特，瓦莱尔，雅克师傅。","SCENE IV.——HARPAGON, CLÉANTE, VALÈRE, MASTER JACQUES."
"阿巴贡而你，我年轻英俊的儿子，今早的事我已经原谅你了，但你不能怠慢她，在她面前摆臭脸色。","Har. And you, my young dandy of a son to whom I have the kindness of forgiving what happened this morning, mind you don’t receive her coldly, or show her a sour face."
"克莱昂特怠慢她！我何必要这么做？","Cle. Receive her coldly!And why should I?"
"阿巴贡何必？何必？我们都知道，当父母再婚的时候，孩子们总是用那种眼神去看他们的继母。可如果你希望我忘记你早上做的荒唐事，我建议你，首先要和善地接待她。总而言之，尽你所能地招待好她。","Har. Why? why?We know pretty well the ways of children whose fathers marry again, and the looks they give to those we call stepmothers. But if you wish me to forget your last offence, I advise you, above all things, to receive her kindly, and, in short, to give her the heartiest welcome you can."
"克莱昂特不瞒您说，父亲，我不能保证她做了我的继母我还很高兴，但是，友好地接受她，和善地欢迎她，我可以答应，并照您说的一切去做。","Cle. To speak the truth, father, I cannot promise you that I am very happy to see her become my stepmother; but as to receiving her properly, and as to giving her a kind welcome, I promise to obey you in that to the very letter."
"阿巴贡反正给我当心点。","Har. Be careful you do, at least."
"克莱昂特您不会有什么地方需要责怪我的。","Cle. You will see that you have no cause to complain."
"阿巴贡你最好这么做。","Har. You will do wisely."
"第五场——阿巴贡，瓦莱尔，雅克师傅。","SCENE V.——HARPAGON, VALÈRE, MASTER JACQUES."
"阿巴贡瓦莱尔，你给我打下手。现在，雅克师傅，我把最后的事务吩咐给你。","Har. Valère, you will have to give me your help in this business. Now, Master Jacques, I kept you for the last."
"雅克师傅老爷，您是想对您的马车夫说话，还是您的厨师说话？我干两份差事。","Jac. Is it to your coachman, Sir, or to your cook you want to speak, for I am both the one and the other?"
"阿巴贡两个一起。","Har. To both."
"雅克师傅那您先跟谁说？","Jac. But to which of the two first?"
"阿巴贡先跟厨师说。","Har. To the cook."
"雅克师傅不好意思，请稍等。（雅克师傅脱掉车夫外套，里面露出厨师的制服。）","Jac. Then wait a minute, if you please.(Jacques takes off his stable-coat and appears dressed as a cook.)"
"阿巴贡哪来那么多臭规矩？","Har. What the deuce is the meaning of this ceremony?"
"雅克师傅现在我听您吩咐。","Jac. Now I am at your service."
"阿巴贡雅克师傅，我已决定今晚要举行晚宴。","Har. I have engaged myself, Master Jacques, to give a supper to-night."
"雅克师傅（旁白）真棒！","Jac. (aside). Wonderful!"
"阿巴贡那么给我说说，你能给我们做顿美味的晚餐吗？","Har. Tell me, can you give us a good supper?"
"雅克师傅能啊，只要您给我足够买菜的钱。","Jac. Yes, if you give me plenty of money."
"阿巴贡什么！永远都是钱！我真想不出他们除了钱、钱、钱，还能说些什么！嘴巴里只有那个字，钱！他们只知道提钱！他们恨不得睡在钱堆里！","Har. The deuce!Always money!I think they have nothing else to say except money, money, money!Always that same word in their mouth, money!They always speak of money!It’s their pillow companion, money!"
"瓦莱尔我从没听过如此无礼的回答！要花很多钱才做得出一顿美味的晚餐，那还叫手艺？这不是世上最简单的事？最笨的人也知道怎么做。可是一个聪明的厨师，就应该用最少的钱做出最美味的晚餐。","Val. Never did I hear such an impertinent answer!Would you call it wonderful to provide good cheer with plenty of money?Is it not the easiest thing in the world?The most stupid could do as much. But a clever man should talk of a good supper with little money."
"雅克师傅最少的钱做出最美味的晚餐？","Jac. A good supper with little money?"
"瓦莱尔是的。","Val. Yes."
"雅克师傅（对瓦莱尔）的确，管家先生，如果你能把你的这个秘密告诉我，或者，如果你愿意顶替我来做这个厨师的话，我会感激涕零的，反正这儿没你不管的事。","Jac. (to Valère). Indeed, Mr. Steward, you will oblige me greatly by telling me your secret, and also, if you like, by filling my place as cook; for you keep on meddling here, and want to be everything."
"阿巴贡别废话。我们晚上做什么吃的？","Har. Hold your tongue. What shall we want?"
"雅克师傅去问管家先生呀，他会用最少的钱做出最美味的晚餐。","Jac. Ask that of Mr. Steward, who will give you good cheer with little money."
"阿巴贡你听见了吗？我是在问你，我要你给我个答复。","Har. Do you hear?I am speaking to you, and expect you to answer me."
"雅克师傅晚上有多少人来吃饭？","Jac. How many will there be at your table?"
"阿巴贡八个，或十个，就照着八个人的分量准备。八个人的饭菜足够十个人吃的。","Har. Eight or ten; but you must only reckon for eight. When there is enough for eight, there is enough for ten."
"瓦莱尔那当然。雅克师傅：那么很好，就做四盆汤，五个小菜。汤，主菜……","Val. That is evident.Jac. Very well, then; you must have four tureens of soup and five side dishes; soups, entrées …"
"阿巴贡什么！你做这么多菜想喂饱整个镇上的人吗？","Har. What!do you mean to feed a whole town?"
"雅克师傅烤肉……","Jac. Roast …"
"阿巴贡（马上用手捂住雅克师傅的嘴。）啊！坏蛋！你要把我吃穷啊。","Har. (clapping his hand on Master Jacques’ mouth). Ah!Wretch!you are eating up all my substance."
"雅克师傅饭后甜点……","Jac. Entremêts …"
"阿巴贡（又用手捂住雅克师傅的嘴。）还没说够？","Har. (again putting his hand on Jacques’ mouth). More still?"
"瓦莱尔（对雅克师傅）你想撑死所有人啊？你以为你家老爷请客，是为了让他们拼命吃东西而让他们撑死吗？去看一看有关健康的劝告吧，问一问医生，是不是暴饮暴食对身体有害。","Val. (to Jacques). Do you mean to kill everybody?And has your master invited people in order to destroy them with over-feeding?Go and read a little the precepts of health, and ask the doctors if there is anything so hurtful to man as excess in eating."
"阿巴贡他说得对极了。","Har. He is perfectly right."
"瓦莱尔雅克师傅，你和你的同行要记住，摆满佳肴的宴席是要人命的。所以，要想对邀请的客人表示友好，就得用简朴的饭菜来招待他们。而且，有句古话说得好，“我们吃饭是为了生存，可生存不是为了吃饭。”","Val. Know, Master Jacques, you and people like you, that a table overloaded with eatables is a real cut-throat; that, to be the true friends of those we invite, frugality should reign throughout the repast we give, and that according to the saying of one of the ancients, “We must eat to live, and not live to eat.”"
"阿巴贡啊！这话说得多好啊！来，我得为你最后那句话跟你拥抱一下。那是我听过最美妙的一句话了：“我们生存是为了吃饭，可吃饭不是为了生存。”不，不是这样说的。你刚才怎么说来着？","Har. Ah!How well the man speaks!Come near, let me embrace you for this last saying. It is the finest sentence that I have ever heard in my life: “We must live to eat, and not eat to live.” No; that isn’t it. How do you say it?"
"瓦莱尔“我们吃饭是为了生存，可生存不是为了吃饭。”","Val. That we must eat to live, and not live to eat."
"阿巴贡（对着雅克师傅）对。你都听到了？（对着瓦莱尔）是哪位伟人说的这句话？","Har. (to Master Jacques). Yes. Do you hear that?(To Valère) Who is the great man who said that?"
"瓦莱尔我一时想不起他的名字了。","Val. I do not exactly recollect his name just now."
"阿巴贡记着给我把那句话写下来，我要把这句话用金字刻在客厅的壁炉上面。","Har. Remember to write down those words for me. I will have them engraved in letters of gold over the mantel-piece of my dining-room."
"瓦莱尔一切照办。至于晚餐，您还是让我来操办吧。我会把它办得无可挑剔。","Val. I will not fail. As for your supper, you had better let me manage it. I will see that it is all as it should be."
"阿巴贡行。","Har. Do so."
"雅克师傅这太好了，我就少操点心了。","Jac. So much the better; all the less work for me."
"阿巴贡（对瓦莱尔）我们要准备客人不能多吃的食物，这样就吃不多，看着就觉得饱了。例如油腻的大豆，和塞满栗子的馅饼。","Har. (to Valère). We must have some of those things of which it is not possible to eat much, and that satisfy directly. Some good fat beans, and a pâté well stuffed with chestnuts."
"瓦莱尔包在我身上。","Val. Trust to me."
"阿巴贡雅克师傅，现在你去把马车冲洗干净。","Har. Now, Master Jacques, you must clean my carriage."
"雅克师傅等等，您这是在对马车夫说话。（雅克师傅穿上外套。）您刚才说……","Jac. Wait a moment; this is to the coachman. (Jacques puts on his coat.)  You say …"
"阿巴贡去把马车清洗干净，备好马匹，待会儿要去集市。","Har. That you must clean my carriage, and have my horses ready to drive to the fair."
"雅克师傅您的马匹！说实在的，老爷，您的马匹根本走不了路。我不是说它们倒在了干草垛上，因为那些可怜的马根本没有干草可吃，这也许不是事实。可是您严厉地让它们节食，现在它们已经变成了幻影，或者是幽灵，已经徒有其名了。","Jac. Your horses!Upon my word, Sir, they are not at all in a condition to stir. I won’t tell you that they are laid up, for the poor things have got nothing to lie upon, and it would not be telling the truth. But you make them keep such rigid fasts that they are nothing but phantoms, ideas, and mere shadows of horses."
"阿巴贡它们真让人可怜，可它们没干什么。","Har. They are much to be pitied. They have nothing to do."
"雅克师傅那就因为它们没干什么，就不给它们吃的了？这些可怜的牲口，最好是干得多吃得也多。看着它们现在饿成这个样子，我的心都碎了，一句话，因为我心疼我的这些马，而且看着它们一天天消瘦下去，就好像我看见自己在消瘦。每天我从自己嘴里省下些吃的来喂它们。老爷，对近邻都没一点恻隐之心，这心肠也太狠了。","Jac. And because they have nothing to do, must they have nothing to eat?It would be much better for them, poor things, to work much and eat to correspond. It breaks my heart to see them so reduced; for, in short, I love my horses; and when I see them suffer, it seems as if it were myself. Every day I take the bread out of my own mouth to feed them; and it is being too hard-hearted, Sir, to have no compassion upon one’s neighbour."
"阿巴贡从家到集市并不是很累的活。","Har. It won’t be very hard work to go to the fair."
"雅克师傅不可，老爷。我不忍心去鞭笞它们，它们已经变成这样了，还鞭打它们，这我可做不出来。你怎会忍得下心让它们去拖动一辆马车？它们连自己都拉不动了。","Jac. No, Sir. I haven’t the heart to drive them; it would go too much against my conscience to use the whip to them in the state they are in. How could you expect them to drag a carriage?They have not even strength enough to drag themselves along."
"瓦莱尔老爷，我叫我们的邻居皮卡尔来赶马车吧，再说准备晚餐也需要他来帮忙。","Val. Sir, I will ask our neighbour, Picard, to drive them; particularly as we shall want his help to get the supper ready."
"雅克师傅就这样吧。我宁愿让他们死在别人手上，也别死在我手上。","Jac. Be it so. I had much rather they should die under another’s hand than under mine."
"瓦莱尔雅克师傅，你想得真是太周到了。","Val. Master Jacques is mightily considerate."
"雅克师傅管家先生，你可是不可或缺的人才啊。","Jac. Mr. Steward is mightily indispensable."
"阿巴贡闭嘴。","Har. Peace."
"雅克师傅老爷，我无法忍受那样拍马屁，我看得出，这个人所做的事，包括没完没了地检查面包、酒水、柴火、盐巴、还有蜡烛，都是为了拍您的马屁，为了讨您的喜欢。我看着就是受不了，我也很生气每天都听到别人对您的指指点点，因为毕竟，我对您是怀有敬重之情的，而且，这世上除了我的那些马，您就是我最喜爱的人了。","Jac. Sir, I can’t bear these flatteries, and I can see that, whatever this man does, his continual watching after the bread, wine, wood, salt, and candles, is done but to curry favour and to make his court to you.I am indignant to see it all; and I am sorry to hear every day what is said of you; for, after all, I have a certain tenderness for you; and, except my horses, you are the person I like most in the world."
"阿巴贡那么雅克师傅，你告诉我别人在我背后都说了些什么吧。","Har. And I would know from you, Master Jacques, what it is that is said of me."
"雅克师傅是，当然，老爷，但您得保证听后不迁怒于我。","Jac. Yes, certainly, Sir, if I were sure you would not get angry with me."
"阿巴贡不，不会，别怕。","Har. No, no; never fear."
"雅克师傅请原谅，我知道您一定会生气的。","Jac. Excuse me, but I am sure you will be angry."
"阿巴贡不会，相反，我还会感谢你呢。我很乐意去了解别人对我的看法。","Har. No, on the contrary, you will oblige me. I should be glad to know what people say of me."
"雅克师傅既然您愿意听，老爷，那我就老老实实告诉您吧，您已是大家口中的笑柄了，他们从各方面挖苦您，讥笑您，他们最高兴的事就是说您的坏话，没完没了地编造您吝啬的故事。有人说，您让人印刷了一种很特别的日历，将每个季节的守斋期延长一倍，为的是强迫全家人多吃几天斋。还有，在年底或辞退仆人的时候，您总是找茬跟仆人吵架，为的是找个理由不给他们工钱。还有人说，您因为邻居家的猫偷吃了您家剩菜里的羊腿肉，把那只猫告上法庭。另有人说，一天晚上，您被撞见从自己的马厩里偷燕麦，然后您的马车夫，当然指的是我之前那一任，黑灯瞎火之中狠狠揍了您一顿，您对这事只字未提。总之，还有必要这样继续说下去吗？我们现在无论走到哪儿，都能听到别人把您说得一文不值。您已经是大家的笑料和话柄了，而且只要一提到您，都用您的外号，什么吝啬鬼、守财奴、铁公鸡、小气鬼和刻薄鬼之类的。","Jac. Since you wish it, Sir, I will tell you frankly that you are the laughing-stock of everybody; that they taunt us everywhere by a thousand jokes on your account, and that nothing delights people more than to make sport of you, and to tell stories without end about your stinginess. One says that you have special almanacks printed, where you double the ember days and vigils, so that you may profit by the fasts to which you bind all your house; another, that you always have a ready-made quarrel for your servants at Christmas time or when they leave you, so that you may give them nothing.One tells a story how not long since you prosecuted a neighbour’s cat because it had eaten up the remainder of a leg of mutton; another says that one night you were caught stealing your horses’ oats, and that your coachman,—that is the man who was before me,—gave you, in the dark, a good sound drubbing, of which you said nothing. In short, what is the use of going on?We can go nowhere but we are sure to hear you pulled to pieces. You are the butt and jest and byword of everybody; and never does anyone mention you but under the names of miser, stingy, mean, niggardly fellow and usurer."
"阿巴贡（动手打雅克师傅）你这个蠢货、无赖、混蛋、无礼的家伙。","Har. (beating Jacques). You are a fool, a rascal, a scoundrel, and an impertinent wretch."
"雅克师傅得了，得了！我早就该猜到您会这样。说了您也不信。我告诉过您如果我说实话，您准会生气的吧？","Jac. There, there!Did not I know how it would be?You would not believe me. I told you I should make you angry if I spoke the truth?"
"阿巴贡你去学学怎么说话。","Har. Learn how to speak."
"第六场——瓦莱尔，雅克师傅。","SCENE VI.——VALÈRE, MASTER JACQUES."
"瓦莱尔（大笑）这下好了，雅克师傅，这就是你说实话的代价。","Val. (laughing). Well, Master Jacques, your frankness is badly rewarded, I fear."
"雅克师傅该死的！这位自命不凡的先生，别自以为多有分量，依我看，这根本不关你的事。先别嘲笑我，等你挨棍子的时候再笑吧。","Jac. S’death!Mr. Upstart, you who assume the man of consequence, it is no business of yours as far as I can see. Laugh at your own cudgelling when you get it, and don’t come here and laugh at mine."
"瓦莱尔啊！雅克师傅，我请求你别这么生气嘛。","Val. Ah!Master Jacques, don’t get into a passion, I beg of you."
"雅克师傅（旁白）他现在想和解。我得给他点厉害瞧瞧，要他真的笨到被我吓怕，我就报复他一下。（对瓦莱尔）你知道吗，这位喜欢笑的先生，我现在笑不出来，如果你一再激怒我，我会让你换个方式笑的。（雅克师傅威胁瓦莱尔，推搡着瓦莱尔直到舞台远端。）","Jac. (aside). He is drawing in his horns. I will put on a bold face, and if he is fool enough to be afraid of me, I will pay him back somewhat. (To Valère) Do you know, Mr. Grinner, that I am not exactly in a laughing humour, and that if you provoke me too much, I shall make you laugh after another fashion. (Jacques pushes Valère to the farther end of the stage, threatening him.)"
"瓦莱尔慢点，慢点。","Val. Gently, gently."
"雅克师傅要多慢？那如果我不高兴慢点呢？","Jac. How gently?And if it does not please me to go gently?"
"瓦莱尔来吧，来吧！你到底想干吗？","Val. Come, come!What are you about?"
"雅克师傅你这个厚颜无耻的无赖。","Jac. You are an impudent rascal."
"瓦莱尔雅克师傅……","Val. Master Jacques …"
"雅克师傅这儿没你雅克师傅！如果我现在手上有棍子，我会结结实实揍你一顿。","Jac. None of your Master Jacques here!If I take up a stick, I shall soon make you feel it."
"瓦莱尔你说棍子是什么意思？（瓦莱尔反过来推搡着雅克师傅到舞台另一端。）","Val. What do you mean by a stick?(Drives back Jacques in his turn.)"
"雅克师傅没什么，我说的不是这个。","Jac. No; I don’t say anything about that."
"瓦莱尔你知道吗，这位狂妄自大的先生，我就是那个要揍你一顿的人。","Val. Do you know, Mr. Conceit, that I am a man to give you a drubbing in good earnest?"
"雅克师傅那当然。","Jac. I have no doubt of it."
"瓦莱尔还有，终究你只是一个不值一提的厨子。","Val. That, after all, you are nothing but a scrub of a cook?"
"雅克师傅我非常清楚。","Jac. I know it very well."
"瓦莱尔你对我还是不了解？","Val. And that you don’t know me yet?"
"雅克师傅我请求你的原谅。","Jac. I beg your pardon."
"瓦莱尔你说你要揍我？","Val. You will beat me, you say?"
"雅克师傅我只是开玩笑来着。","Jac. I only spoke in jest."
"瓦莱尔可我不喜欢你这玩笑，而且（开始打雅克师傅）记住，你的玩笑非常愚蠢。","Val. I don’t like your jesting, and (beating Jacques) remember that you are but a sorry hand at it."
"雅克师傅（独自一人）让老实话都见鬼去吧，真是好心没好报。以后，我再也不说实话了。我家老爷打我还说得过去，可哪里跑来个管家也跟着凑热闹，他凭什么打我？我有机会一定会报复他。","Jac. (alone). Plague take all sincerity; it is a bad trade. I give it up for the future, and will cease to tell the truth. It is all very well for my master to beat me; but as for that Mr. Steward, what right has he to do it?I will be revenged on him if I can."
"第七场——玛丽安娜，弗罗辛娜，雅克师傅。","SCENE VII.——MARIANNE, FROSINE, MASTER JACQUES."
"弗罗辛娜你的主人在家吗？","Fro. Do you know if your master is at home?"
"雅克师傅在，当然在家，我非常清楚。","Jac. Yes, he is indeed; I know it but too well."
"弗罗辛娜那请通报他一声，我们到了。","Fro. Tell him, please, that we are here."
"第八场——玛丽安娜，弗罗辛娜。","SCENE VIII.——MARIANNE, FROSINE."
"玛丽安娜啊！弗罗辛娜，我怎么感觉这么奇怪，我真担心这次见面！","Mar. Ah!Frosine, how strange I feel, and how I dread this interview!"
"弗罗辛娜为什么呢？有什么可担心的？","Fro. Why should you?What can you possibly dread?"
"玛丽安娜哎！你明知故问？难道你不懂得，一个人即将面临别人让她忍受的痛苦时，她是多么惊惶？","Mar. Alas!can you ask me?Can you not understand the alarms of a person about to see the instrument of torture to which she is to be tied."
"弗罗辛娜我看得出来，即使死也要死得痛快，你绝不会愿意忍受阿巴贡这样的人的，而且从你的眼神中我还看得出来，你给我提过的那位年轻小伙一定还让你念念不忘。","Fro. I see very well that to die agreeably, Harpagon is not the torture you would embrace; and I can judge by your looks that the fair young man you spoke of to me is still in your thoughts."
"玛丽安娜是的，弗罗辛娜，这件事我并不否认。他几次彬彬有礼地拜访我家，说真的，这触动了我的心。","Mar. Yes, Frosine; it is a thing I do not wish to deny. The respectful visits he has paid at our house have left, I confess, a great impression on my heart."
"弗罗辛娜可是你知道他是怎样的人吗？","Fro. But do you know who he is?"
"玛丽安娜不，我不知道，我只知道他讨人喜欢。如果事情能够允许我自己做选择，我一定要嫁给他，而不是其他人，而且我把别人给我选择的丈夫看作是生活的枷锁和折磨，都是受到他的影响。","Mar. No, I do not. All I know is that he is made to be loved; that if things were left to my choice, I would much rather marry him than any other, and that he adds not a little to the horrible dread that I have of the husband they want to force upon me."
"弗罗辛娜哦，是的！那些花花公子很善于取悦女人，说话也漂亮得体，可是大多数也穷得一贫如洗。而嫁给上年纪的老头儿就好多了，他们可都是腰缠万贯啊。我完全承认我刚才所说的话有些难听，的确嫁给他这个人会有些难以忍受。但是这不会长久，相信我，他只要一死，你很快就能重新寻找一个称心如意的好丈夫，一切都能弥补回来。","Fro. Oh yes!All those dandies are very pleasant, and can talk agreeably enough, but most of them are as poor as church mice; and it is much better for you to marry an old husband, who gives you plenty of money. I fully acknowledge that the senses somewhat clash with the end I propose, and that there are certain little inconveniences to be endured with such a husband; but all that won’t last; and his death, believe me, will soon put you in a position to take a more pleasant husband, who will make amends for all."
"玛丽安娜哦，弗罗辛娜！为了得到幸福，我们却盼着一个人结束生命，这个逻辑太奇怪了。况且，死亡可不是我们能预料到的事。","Mar. Oh, Frosine!What a strange state of things that, in order to be happy, we must look forward to the death of another.Yet death will not fall in with all the projects we make."
"弗罗辛娜你开玩笑吧。你嫁给他，是因为清楚用不了多久，你就会成为寡妇，这条应该白纸黑字在婚约条款里写着。如果三个月后，他还活着，那才叫人讨厌呢。说他，他就来了。","Fro. You are joking. You marry him with the express understanding that he will soon leave you a widow; it must be one of the articles of the marriage contract.It would be very wrong in him not to die before three months are over.Here he is himself."
"玛丽安娜啊！亲爱的弗罗辛娜，这人长得真难看！","Mar. Ah!dear Frosine, what a face!"
"第九场——阿巴贡，玛丽安娜，弗罗辛娜。","SCENE IX.——HARPAGON, MARIANNE, FROSINE."
"阿巴贡（对玛丽安娜）你可别介意，美丽的姑娘，我特意戴着眼镜来迎接您了。我知道您的美丽不用戴眼镜也能看得很清楚，可是，要欣赏一颗星星我们就必须得戴眼镜，而我认为您就是一颗星星，是漫天繁星中最美丽的一颗。弗罗辛娜，她怎么不说话，我美丽的星星好像看到我不太高兴啊。","Har. (to Marianne). Do not be offended, fair one, if I come to you with my glasses on.  I know that your beauty is great enough to be seen with the naked eye; but, still, it is with glasses that we look at the stars, and I maintain and uphold that you are a star, the most beautiful and in the land of stars.Frosine, she does not answer, star, it seems to me, shows no joy at the sight of me."
"弗罗辛娜那是因为她对您充满敬畏，年轻女孩一开始都会害羞，不好意思表达她们的内心感受。","Fro. It is because she is still quite awe-struck, and young girls are always shy at first, and afraid of showing what they feel."
"阿巴贡（对弗罗辛娜）你说得对。（对玛丽安娜）我亲爱的姑娘，我女儿马上就来招待您。","Har. (to Frosine). You are right. (To Marianne) My pretty darling, there is my daughter coming to welcome you."
"第十场——阿巴贡，埃莉斯，玛丽安娜，弗罗辛娜。","SCENE X.——HARPAGON, ÉLISE, MARIANNE, FROSINE."
"玛丽安娜我其实早就该来问候您的。","Mar. I am very late in acquitting myself of the visit I owed you."
"埃莉斯其实该我来问候您，先去拜访您才对。","Eli. You have done what I ought to have done. It was for me to have come and seen you first."
"阿巴贡您看，她是多好的一个女孩啊。可俗话说得好，恶习易染啊。","Har. You see what a great girl she is; but ill weeds grow apace."
"玛丽安娜（凑到弗罗辛娜耳边私语）他这人真讨厌！","Mar. (aside to Frosine). Oh, what an unpleasant man!"
"阿巴贡（对弗罗辛娜）我美丽的姑娘刚才说什么？","Har. (to Frosine). What does my fair one say?"
"弗罗辛娜她说您很完美。","Fro. That she thinks you perfect."
"阿巴贡您这样说我真是万分荣幸，我可爱的姑娘。","Har. You do me too much honour, my adorable darling."
"玛丽安娜（旁白）他真是个令人厌恶的家伙！","Mar. (aside). What a dreadful creature!"
"阿巴贡承蒙您的夸奖，我真是太感激了。","Har. I really feel too grateful to you for these sentiments."
"玛丽安娜（旁白）我实在无法忍受了。","Mar. (aside). I can bear it no longer."
"第十一场——阿巴贡，玛丽安娜，克莱昂特，瓦莱尔，弗罗辛娜，布兰达瓦纳。","SCENE XI.——HARPAGON, MARIANNE, ÉLISE, CLÉANTE, VALÈRE, FROSINE, BRINDAVOINE."
"阿巴贡这是我的儿子，他也来向您表示敬意啦。","Har. Here is my son, who also comes to pay his respects to you."
"玛丽安娜（凑到弗罗辛娜耳边私语）哦，弗罗辛娜！怎么会遇见他！他就是我给你提起的那个人。","Mar. (aside to Frosine). Oh, Frosine! what a strange meeting!He is the very one of whom I spoke to you."
"弗罗辛娜（对玛丽安娜）这可太巧了。","Fro. (to Marianne). Well, that is extraordinary."
"阿巴贡您也许会惊讶我有这么大的孩子了，可是我很快就会把他们打发出去的。","Har. You are surprised to see that my children can be so old; but I shall soon get rid of both of them."
"克莱昂特（对玛丽安娜）小姐，跟您说实话，我从未想过我们会如此见面，当我父亲告诉我他今天的决定后，我感到非常吃惊。","Cle. (to Marianne). Madam, to tell you the truth, I little expected such an event; and my father surprised me not a little when he told me to-day of the decision he had come to."
"玛丽安娜我也有同样的感觉。能在这里见到您，这是我绝对没有料到的。","Mar. I can say the same thing. It is an unexpected meeting; and I certainly was far from being prepared for such an event."
"克莱昂特小姐，我父亲的确选择了最好的姑娘。能在这里招待您是我的荣幸，真是太高兴了。但同时，对您愿意成为我的继母这件事，我不能说我为此感到高兴。我必须承认，要向您表达祝贺，我真的很难做到。而且您得到这个名分，是我最不愿意看到的。我这么说话也许对某个人来说非常的粗鲁无礼，但我相信您会了解的。这桩婚事，小姐，我是完全反对的。既然现在您知道我是谁了，您不会不了解这件事对我的利益有多大的损害。假如经过了我父亲允许，我不得不说，如果我能自主选择，这件事绝不会发生。","Cle. Madam, my father cannot make a better choice, and it is a great joy to me to have the honour of welcoming you here. At the same time, I cannot say that I should rejoice if it were your intention to become my stepmother. I must confess that I should find it difficult to pay you the compliment; and it is a title, forgive me, that I cannot wish you to have. To some this speech would seem coarse, but I feel that you understand it. This marriage, Madam, is altogether repugnant to me. You are not ignorant, now that you know who I am, how opposed it is to all my own interests, and with my father’s permission I hope you will allow me to say that, if things depended on me, it would never take place."
"阿巴贡（旁白）这祝福让人听起来真不舒服，他怎么把自己的内心感受都说给她听了！","Har. (aside). What a very impertinent speech to make; and what a confession to make to her!"
"玛丽安娜作为对您的回答，我必须说，我和您的感受是相同的。如果您不愿看到我成为您的继母，那我也同样不愿看到您成为我的孩子。我请求您，千万别误会，认为是我愿意给您造成这样的局面。我为给您带来的痛苦感到非常难过，要不是我承受着极大的压力，使我别无选择，我向您保证，我绝不会同意这桩婚事，让您深陷痛苦中。","Mar. And as my answer, I must tell you that things are much the same with me, and that, if you have any repugnance in seeing me your stepmother, I shall have no less in seeing you my stepson.  Do not believe, I beg of you, that it is of my own will that this trouble has come upon you. I should be deeply grieved to cause you the least sorrow, and unless I am forced to it by a power I must obey, I give you my word that, I will never consent to a marriage which is so painful to you."
"阿巴贡她说得对。对这种愚蠢的祝福就应该这样回答。我请求您原谅，我的美人，原谅我儿子这样的鲁莽。他年轻不懂事，还不知道这样说话会带来怎样的后果。","Har. She is right. A foolish speech deserves a foolish answer. I beg your pardon, my love, for the impertinence of my son. He is a silly young fellow, who has not yet learnt the value of his own words."
"玛丽安娜我向您保证他没有冒犯到我。相反，我很感激他对我说出了他真实的感受。我非常喜欢他的坦诚，要是他换另一种方式说话，我就不会这么欣赏他了。","Mar. I assure you that he has not at all offended me. I am thankful, on the contrary, that he has spoken so openly. I care greatly for such a confession from him, and if he had spoken differently, I should feel much less esteem for him."
"阿巴贡您能这样原谅他的过错，真是太善良了。日子长了，他会懂事的，您等着瞧吧，他也会改变想法的。","Har. It is very kind of you to excuse him thus. Time will make him wiser, and you will see that his feelings will change."
"克莱昂特不会，父亲，我的想法绝不改变。我也恳请您，小姐，一定要相信这一点。","Cle. No, father, they will never change; and I earnestly beg of you, Madam, to believe me."
"阿巴贡你们见过这么荒唐的人吗？他越说越放肆。","Har. Did ever anybody see such folly?He is becoming worse and worse."
"克莱昂特难道您想我背叛我自己的真实感受？","Cle. Would you have me false to my inmost feelings?"
"阿巴贡还说！请你换个方式说话。","Har. Again!Change your manners, if you please."
"克莱昂特那好，您既然希望我换个方式，那么请允许我，小姐，替我父亲说几句，请别见怪。您是我平生见过的最迷人的女子，能获得您的芳心是最大的幸福，能成为您的丈夫是一种荣耀，一种福气，为此我不惜抛弃做全世界最伟大的王子的命运。是的，小姐，在我看来，能够拥有您，就是拥有了全世界最富有的宝藏，得到您就是我毕生的愿望。为了达到这个目的，我赴汤蹈火，在所不辞，哪怕存在最大的障碍……","Cle. Very well, since you wish me to speak differently. Allow me, Madam, to take for a moment my father’s place; and forgive me if I tell you that I never saw in the world anybody more charming than you are; that I can understand no happiness to equal that of pleasing you, and that to be your husband is a glory, a felicity, I should prefer to the destinies of the greatest princes upon earth. Yes, Madam, to possess you is, in my mind, to possess the best of all treasures; to obtain you is all my ambition. There is nothing I would not do for so precious a conquest, and the most powerful obstacles …"
"阿巴贡请平静，平静，我的儿子。","Har. Gently, gently, my son, if you please."
"克莱昂特这是我替您对这位小姐说的好话啊。","Cle. These are complimentary words which I speak to her in your name."
"阿巴贡老天保佑！我自己长了嘴，可以自己说话，而且我也不需要你来替我说……去拿些椅子来。","Har. Bless me!I have a tongue of my own to explain my feelings, and I really don’t care for such an advocate as you … Here, bring us some chairs."
"弗罗辛娜不用，我觉得我们最好马上去集市，这样可以早点回来，你们也有足够的时间说会儿话。","Fro. No; I think it is better for us to go at once to the fair, in order to be back earlier, and have plenty of time for talking."
"阿巴贡（对布兰达瓦纳）快去把马车备好。","Har. (to Brindavoine). Have the carriage ready at once."
"第十二场——阿巴贡，玛丽安娜，克莱昂特，瓦莱尔，弗罗辛娜。","SCENE XII.——HARPAGON, MARIANNE, ÉLISE, CLÉANTE, VALÈRE, FROSINE."
"阿巴贡（对玛丽安娜）我希望您能原谅，亲爱的，我忘记在您逛集市之前准备点点心了。","Har. (to Marianne). I hope you will excuse me, my dear, but I forgot to order some refreshments for you, before you went out."
"克莱昂特我没忘记，父亲，我让人去订了几篮中国蜜桔、柠檬和蜜饯，都是以您的名义买的。","Cle. I have thought of it, father, and have ordered to be brought in here some baskets of China oranges, sweet citrons, and preserves, which I sent for in your name."
"阿巴贡（旁白，对瓦莱尔）瓦莱尔！","Har. (aside, to Valère). Valère!"
"瓦莱尔（旁白，对阿巴贡）他已经失去了理智！","Val. (aside, to Harpagon). He has lost his senses!"
"克莱昂特父亲，难道您是担心这些不够吗？小姐，我希望您也别往心里去。","Cle. You are afraid, father, that it will not be enough?I hope, Madam, that you will have the kindness to excuse it."
"玛丽安娜你们没必要准备这些。","Mar. It was by no means necessary."
"克莱昂特我说小姐，您以前见过比我父亲手上这钻戒还闪亮的吗？","Cle. Did you ever see, Madam, a more brilliant diamond than the one my father has upon his finger?"
"玛丽安娜这钻戒的确很耀眼。","Mar. It certainly sparkles very much."
"克莱昂特（把钻戒从父亲手指上扒下来）您可以靠近点瞧瞧。","Cle. (taking the diamond off his father’s finger). You must see it near."
"玛丽安娜它真漂亮，光泽也很耀眼。","Mar. It is a beautiful one; it possesses great lustre."
"克莱昂特（站到玛丽安娜前面，玛丽安娜准备归还钻戒）不用，小姐，要戴在手上才更漂亮，这是我父亲送您的礼物。","Cle. (steps before Marianne, who wants to restore it). No, Madam, it is in hands too beautiful; it is a present my father gives you."
"阿巴贡我？","Har. I?"
"克莱昂特不是吗，父亲？您不是希望玛丽安娜小姐为了你而收下它吗？","Cle. Is it not true, father, that you wish her to keep it for your sake?"
"阿巴贡（旁白，对儿子）什么？","Har. (aside, to his son). What?"
"克莱昂特（对玛丽安娜）这还用问！他让我请您一定要收下。","Cle. (to Marianne). A strange question indeed!He is making me signs that I am to force you to accept it."
"玛丽安娜我可不能……","Mar. I would not …"
"克莱昂特（对玛丽安娜）我请求您……他是不会收回去的。","Cle. (to Marianne). I beg of you…. He would not take it back."
"阿巴贡（旁白）气死我了！","Har. (aside). I am bursting with rage!"
"玛丽安娜这太……","Mar. It would be …"
"克莱昂特（依然阻止玛丽安娜把钻戒归还）不，听我的，不收下他会不高兴的。","Cle. (still hindering Marianne from returning it). No; I tell you, you will offend him."
"玛丽安娜请您……","Mar. Pray …"
"克莱昂特一定得收下。","Cle. By no means."
"阿巴贡（旁白）这真见鬼……","Har. (aside). Plague take …"
"克莱昂特您的拒绝让他非常生气。","Cle. He is perfectly shocked at your refusal."
"阿巴贡（旁白，对他的儿子）啊！你这叛徒！","Har. (aside, to his son). Ah! traitor!"
"克莱昂特（对玛丽安娜）您看，他都气成这样了。","Cle. (to Marianne). You see he is in despair."
"阿巴贡（旁白，对他的儿子，威胁他）你这个坏蛋！","Har. (aside, to his son, threatening him). You villain!"
"克莱昂特真的，父亲，不是我的错。我已经尽力劝她收下了，可她就是不要。","Cle. Really, father, it is not my fault. I do all I can to persuade her to accept it; but she is obstinate."
"阿巴贡（气急败坏，旁白，对儿子）无赖！","Har. (in a rage, aside to his son). Rascal!"
"克莱昂特这都是因为您，小姐，我父亲都责备我了。","Cle. You are the cause, Madam, of my father scolding me."
"阿巴贡（旁白，依然气急败坏）混账东西！","Har. (aside, with the same looks). Scoundrel!"
"克莱昂特（对玛丽安娜）您会让他气出病来的，看在上帝的份上，别再犹豫了。","Cle. (to Marianne). You will make him ill; for goodness’ sake, hesitate no longer."
"弗罗辛娜（对玛丽安娜）你还客气什么？收下戒指吧，既然这是老爷的愿望。","Fro. (to Marianne). Why so much ceremony?Keep the ring, since the gentleman wishes you to."
"玛丽安娜（对阿巴贡）老爷，为了不惹您生气，那我暂时收下了，过段时间我会找机会还给您的。","Mar. (to Harpagon). I will keep it now, Sir, in order not to make you angry, and I shall take another opportunity of returning it to you."
"第十三场——阿巴贡，玛丽安娜，埃莉斯，瓦莱尔，弗罗辛娜，布兰达瓦纳。","SCENE XIII.——HARPAGON, MARIANNE, ÉLISE, VALÈRE, FROSINE, BRINDAVOINE."
"布兰达瓦纳老爷，来了一位先生想见您。","Brind. Sir, there is a gentleman here who wants to speak to you."
"阿巴贡告诉他我现在没空，今天无法接见他。","Har. Tell him that I am engaged, and that I cannot see him to-day."
"布兰达瓦纳他说是来给您送钱的。","Brind. He says he has some money for you."
"阿巴贡（对玛丽安娜）请允许我失陪一会儿，我马上就回来。","Har. (to Marianne). Pray, excuse me; I will come back directly."
"第十四场——阿巴贡，玛丽安娜，埃莉斯，克莱昂特，拉·梅吕什。","SCENE XIV.——HARPAGON, MARIANNE, ÉLISE, CLÉANTE, FROSINE, LA MERLUCHE."
"拉·梅吕什（跑着进来，撞倒了阿巴贡）老爷……","La Mer. (comes in running, and throws Harpagon down). Sir …"
"阿巴贡哦！摔死我了。","Har. Oh! he has killed me."
"克莱昂特没事吧，父亲？摔疼了吗？","Cle. What’s the matter, father?Have you hurt yourself?"
"阿巴贡这个坏蛋，一定是收了我债务人的贿赂，要加害于我。","Har. The wretch must have been bribed by some of my debtors to break my neck."
"瓦莱尔（对阿巴贡）看来没摔坏。","Val. (to Harpagon). There is nothing serious."
"拉·梅吕什（对阿巴贡）我请求您原谅，老爷，我想的是我要快点来告诉您……","La Mer. (to Harpagon). I beg your pardon, Sir; I thought I had better run fast to tell you…."
"阿巴贡告诉我什么？","Har. What?"
"拉·梅吕什告诉您那两匹马的马掌都不在了。","La Mer. That your two horses have lost their shoes."
"阿巴贡那就赶快去钉新马掌。","Har. Take them quickly to the smith."
"克莱昂特父亲，那钉马掌的这段时间，请允许我代替您，领这位姑娘到花园转转，顺便在那里吃点点心。","Cle. In the meantime, father, I will do the honours of the house for you, and take this lady into the garden, where lunch will be brought."
"第十五场——阿巴贡，瓦莱尔。","SCENE XV.——HARPAGON, VALÈRE."
"阿巴贡瓦莱尔，你要紧紧盯住这一桌点心，也拜托你，尽你所能，能省多少就省多少，然后剩下的再送回点心铺。","Har. Valère, look after all this; and take care, I beseech you, to save as much of it as you can, so that we may send it back to the tradesman again."
"瓦莱尔我会的。","Val. I will."
"阿巴贡（独自一人）卑鄙小人！真想害我破产？","Har. (alone). Miscreant! do you mean to ruin me?"
"第四幕","ACT IV."
"第一场——克莱昂特，玛丽安娜，埃莉斯，弗罗辛娜。","SCENE I.——CLÉANTE, MARIANNE, ÉLISE, FROSINE."
"克莱昂特来，都进来，这样就好多了。现在身边都是自己人，我们可以自由说话了。","Cle. Let us come in here; we shall be much better. There is no one about us that we need be afraid of, and we can speak openly."
"埃莉斯是的，小姐，我哥哥已经告诉我他对您的爱意了。我明白，如此倒霉的事给你们带来了很大的困扰和忧虑，我也非常同情你们的遭遇。","Eli. Yes, Madam, my brother has told me of the love he has for you. I know what sorrow and anxiety such trials as these may cause, and I assure you that I have the greatest sympathy for you."
"玛丽安娜能够遇见您这样的人关心我们，我感到非常宽慰，我也请求您，小姐，让我们彼此成为朋友，这样就能让我觉得，所发生的这些事情不会那么残酷。","Mar. I feel it a great comfort in my trouble to have the sympathy of a person like you, and I entreat you, Madam, ever to retain for me a friendship so capable of softening the cruelty of my fate."
"弗罗辛娜你们俩真该在之前就告诉我实情。也许我能避免这件事的发生，至少不让事态恶化。","Fro. You really are both very unfortunate not to have told me of all this before. I might certainly have warded off the blow, and not have carried things so far."
"克莱昂特我能怎么做？这都是我的命不好，逃不了这一劫。但是您，可爱的玛丽安娜，您为何答应这桩婚事？您是下了多大的决心啊？","Cle. What could I do?It is my evil destiny which has willed it so.But you, fair Marianne, what have you resolved to do?What resolution have you taken?"
"玛丽安娜唉！我哪有权利去决定？而且，依我的处境，我除了祈愿上天，还能做什么？","Mar. Alas!Is it in my power to take any resolution?And, dependent as I am, can I do anything else except form wishes?"
"克莱昂特那难道您就没有从心里支持我？只是祈愿老天爷？没有同情的力量？没有温暖的慰藉？没有炙热的感情？","Cle. No other support for me in your heart?Nothing but mere wishes?No pitying energy?No kindly relief?No active affection?"
"玛丽安娜我能对您说些什么？换作我的位置想一想，再判断我是不是真的束手无策。请您给我建议，帮我安排，我是完全信任您的，因为我肯定，您不会让我去做不正确或不恰当的事情。","Mar. What am I to say to you?Put yourself in my place, and judge what I can possibly do.Advise me, dispose of me, I trust myself entirely to you, for I am sure that you will never ask of me anything but what is modest and seemly."
"克莱昂特唉！您希望我做事完全谨小慎微，恰当合理，那您还指望我做什么呢？","Cle. Alas! to what do you reduce me when you wish me to be guided entirely by feelings of strict duty and of scrupulous propriety."
"玛丽安娜那您希望我做什么？即使我真的为了您，不去管女人都会有的顾忌，那我也必须为我母亲着想，她一手把我拉扯大，总是温柔真挚地待我，我也必须考虑可能带给她的任何痛苦。您可以去找她说。争取赢得她的心。您可以按照您想要的方式处理这件事，如果让她知道我的真实感受有可能会扭转局势，就尽您所能告诉她，如果需要，我一定会亲自去向她说明我的感受。","Mar. But what would you have me do?Even if I were, for you, to divest myself of the many scruples which our sex imposes on us, I have too much regard for my mother, who has brought me up with great tenderness, for me to give her any cause of sorrow. Do all you can with her. Strive to win her.I give you leave to say and do all you wish; and if anything depends upon her knowing the true state of my feelings, by all means tell her what they are; indeed I will do it myself if necessary."
"克莱昂特弗罗辛娜，亲爱的弗罗辛娜，您能帮助我们吗？","Cle. Frosine, dear Frosine, will you not help us?"
"弗罗辛娜当然，你们知道的，我很乐意帮助你们。我不是个无情无义的人，上天没有赋予我铁一样的心肠。当我看到年轻人诚实真心地相爱，我就忍不住想全力地去撮合。我们怎么处理这个情况？","Fro. Indeed, I should like to do so, as you know. I am not naturally unkind. Heaven has not given me a heart of flint, and I feel but too ready to help when I see young people loving each other in all earnestness and honesty. What can we do in this case?"
"克莱昂特试着想个法子。","Cle. Try and think a little."
"玛丽安娜帮我们想想。","Mar. Advise us."
"埃莉斯想个办法让您之前安排的事情都不成立。","Eli. Invent something to undo what you have done."
"弗罗辛娜这可不容易。（对玛丽安娜）至于你母亲，她也不是不通情理的人，我们也许可以让她改变主意把你嫁给他，而不是他父亲。（对克莱昂特）但整件事最难攻克的就是你的父亲，是你的父亲啊。","Fro. Rather a difficult piece of business. (To Marianne) As far as your mother is concerned, she is not altogether unreasonable and we might succeed in making her give to the son the gift she reserved for the father. (To Cléante) But the most disheartening part of it all is that your father is your father."
"克莱昂特是，的确如此。","Cle. Yes, so it is."
"弗罗辛娜我是说，如果他知道自己被她拒绝了，肯定会恼羞成怒，也更不可能事后还同意你们的婚事。那么就一定得让他自己先拒绝，所以，玛丽安娜，你要想尽办法让他讨厌你。","Fro. I mean that he will bear malice if he sees that he is refused, and he will be in no way disposed afterwards to give his consent to your marriage.It would be well if the refusal could be made to come from him, and you ought to try by some means or other to make him dislike you, Marianne."
"克莱昂特您说得太对了。","Cle. You are quite right."
"弗罗辛娜是的，理论上绝对成立，事情就要这么来办。可是我们要怎么付诸实践呢？等等。假设我们找到一位年纪稍微大点的妇女，也跟我一样有本事，让她打扮成一位有教养的贵妇人，后面还急匆匆地跟着一帮仆人，再起一个古里古怪的侯爵夫人或子爵夫人的名字，再假设说她来自下布列塔尼地区。我有足够的口才说服你父亲相信她是一个富有的女人，除了房子外，她还拥有着数以万计的克朗现金。再加上她一心一意爱着他，无论如何都要嫁给他，而且她在婚约里提出将所有财产都归于他的名下。我相信，他一定会同意这个婚约。当然，他非常喜欢你，亲爱的，但他还是更爱钱。一旦他同意了你们俩的婚事，即使那时他反应过来侯爵夫人是个圈套，也无法挽回什么了。","Fro. Yes, right enough, no doubt. That is what ought to be done; but how in the world are we to set about it?Wait a moment. Suppose we had a somewhat elderly woman with a little of the ability which I possess, and able sufficiently well to represent a lady of rank, by means of a retinue made up in haste, and of some whimsical title of a marchioness or viscountess, whom we would suppose to come from Lower Brittany.I should have enough power over your father to persuade him that she is a rich woman, in possession, besides her houses, of a hundred thousand crowns in ready money; that she is deeply in love with him, and that she would marry him at any cost, were she even to give him all her money by the marriage contract.I have no doubt he would listen to the proposal. For certainly he loves you very much, my dear, but he loves money still better. When once he has consented to your marriage, it does not signify much how he finds out the true state of affairs about our marchioness."
"克莱昂特这个办法太妙了。","Cle. All that is very well made up."
"弗罗辛娜这件事我来办，我刚好想起我一个朋友，她可以出色地办好这件事。","Fro. Leave it to me; I just remember one of my friends who will do beautifully."
"克莱昂特这事如果成了，弗罗辛娜，那就太感谢了。可是，亲爱的玛丽安娜，请求您，让我们先去说服您的母亲。一旦您和我父亲的婚约不成立，那您母亲的同意则是关键。我请求您，要用您从您母亲那里学到的温柔真挚去打动她。不要犹豫，充分利用您动人的举止，美丽的眼睛和双唇，这是上天赋予你的财富。我请求您，别忘了要用甜美的话语，真挚的恳求，还有动人的温情去劝她，我相信，她一定不会拒绝的。","Cle. Depend on my gratitude, Frosine, if you succeed. But, dear Marianne, let us begin, I beg of you, by gaining over your mother; it would be a great deal accomplished if this marriage were once broken off. Make use, I beseech you, of all the power that her tenderness for you gives you over her.Display without hesitation those eloquent graces, those all-powerful charms, with which Heaven has endowed your eyes and lips; forget not, I beseech you, those sweet persuasions, those tender entreaties, those loving caresses to which, I feel, nothing could be refused."
"玛丽安娜我会尽力去做，所有这一切我都不会忘记。","Mar. I will do all I can, and will forget nothing."
"第二场——阿巴贡，玛丽安娜，弗罗辛娜。","SCENE II.——HARPAGON, MARIANNE, ÉLISE, FROSINE."
"阿巴贡（旁白，没有人发现）啊！啊！我儿子正在吻他未来继母的手，而他未来继母并没有拒绝！难道这其中有什么秘密？","Har. (aside, and without being seen). Ah! ah! my son is kissing the hand of his intended stepmother, and his intended stepmother does not seem much averse to it!Can there be any mystery in all this?"
"埃莉斯我父亲来了。","Eli. Here comes my father."
"阿巴贡马车已经备好了，你们随时可以启程。","Har. The carriage is quite ready, and you can start when you like."
"克莱昂特父亲，既然您无法陪同前往，请允许我照顾她们吧。","Cle. Since you are not going, father, allow me to take care of them."
"阿巴贡不行，你留下，她们可以自己照顾好自己，我这里需要你。","Har. No, stop here; they can easily take care of themselves, and I want you."
"第三场——阿巴贡，克莱昂特。","SCENE III.——HARPAGON, CLÉANTE."
"阿巴贡好吧，现在，抛开她是你继母的身份，告诉我，你觉得她这个人怎么样？","Har. Well, now, all consideration of stepmother aside, tell me what do you think of this lady?"
"克莱昂特我对她的看法？","Cle. What I think of her?"
"阿巴贡是的，你对她的神情、身材、容貌，还有她的头脑什么看法？","Har. Yes, what do you think of her appearance, her figure, her beauty and intelligence?"
"克莱昂特一般般吧。","Cle. So, so."
"阿巴贡但是？","Har. But still?"
"克莱昂特告诉您实话，我觉得她没有我想象中那么好。她的神情简直是在卖弄风情，她的身材也死板笨拙，她的容貌实在平庸无奇，她的头脑更是一般。别误会我说这些是为了让您讨厌她，因为如果我必须有个继母，那谁来当都是一样，我都可以接受。","Cle. To tell you the truth, I did not find her such as I expected. Her manner is that of a thorough coquette, her figure is rather awkward, her beauty very middling, and her intelligence of the meanest order.Do not suppose that I say this to make you dislike her; for if I must have a stepmother, I like the idea of this one as well as of any other."
"阿巴贡但是，你刚才还说她……","Har. You spoke to her just now, nevertheless…."
"克莱昂特我那是替您说的好话，是为了想让您高兴。","Cle. I paid her several compliments in your name, but it was to please you."
"阿巴贡所以你对她一点都没有好感？","Har. So then you don’t care for her?"
"克莱昂特谁？我？当然没有。","Cle. Who?I?Not in the least."
"阿巴贡我真是难过，因为你的回答刚刚打消了我想到的一个念头。自从刚才看到她，我想了想我自己的年龄，我觉得如果跟她这样一个年轻的女士结婚，可能会被人说三道四。这个考虑让我放弃了原来的打算，但是我已经提出了求婚，也已经给出我了的承诺，于是我就想将她让给你，可惜你刚才说你一点都不喜欢她。","Har. I am sorry for it, for that puts an end to a scheme which had occurred to me. Since I have seen her here, I have been thinking of my own age; and I feel that people would find fault with me for marrying so young a girl. This consideration had made me determine to abandon the project, and as I had demanded her in marriage, and had given her my promise, I would have given her to you if it were not for the dislike you have for her."
"克莱昂特让给我？","Cle. To me?"
"阿巴贡让给你。","Har. To you."
"克莱昂特让我们结婚？","Cle. In marriage?"
"阿巴贡让你们结婚。","Har. In marriage."
"克莱昂特她的确不太合乎我的心意，但是，为了让您高兴，父亲，我愿意娶她为妻，如果您愿意。","Cle. It is true she is not at all to my taste; but, to please you, father, I will bring myself to marry her, if you please."
"阿巴贡如果我愿意！我可比你想象的理智多了，我不想强迫你娶她。","Har. If I please!I am more reasonable than you think. I don’t wish to compel you."
"克莱昂特请您原谅！我会尽力去喜欢上她。","Cle. Excuse me!I will make an attempt to love her."
"阿巴贡不，不，没有感情的婚姻不是幸福的婚姻。","Har. No, no; a marriage cannot be happy where there is no love."
"克莱昂特父亲，感情这东西，也许以后会慢慢有的，而且人们常说，感情往往是婚姻的果实。","Cle. That, my father, will, perhaps, come by and by, and it is said that love is often the fruit of marriage."
"阿巴贡不，对一个男人来说，不能冒这样的险，而且有些麻烦事我也不愿意去尝试。如果你对她有任何好感，你就应该代替我，跟她结婚。可惜事实不是这样，我还是按我原来的打算，我自己跟她结婚。","Har. No, it is not right to risk it on the side of the man, and there are some troublesome things I don’t care to run the chance of. If you had felt any inclination for her, you should have married her instead of me, but as it is, I will return to my first intention and marry her myself."
"克莱昂特那好，父亲，事情既然如此，我就给您说实话吧，告诉您我们之间的私情。事实是，从那天看到她在街上散步，我就爱上她了。我本来打算今天告诉您，请您允许我跟她结婚的，可您给我说了您和她的婚事，我就克制住了自己的感情，只是担心您会不高兴。","Cle. Well, father, since things are so, I had better be frank with you, and reveal our secret to you.The truth is that I have loved her ever since I saw her one day on the promenade.I intended to ask you today to let me marry her, and I was only deterred from it because you spoke of marrying her, and because I feared to displease you."
"阿巴贡你拜访过她了吗？","Har. Have you ever paid her any visits?"
"克莱昂特是的，父亲。","Cle. Yes, father."
"阿巴贡很多次？","Har. Many?"
"克莱昂特是的，从我们认识的时间上看。","Cle. Yes; considering how long we have been acquainted."
"阿巴贡她很热情地招待了你吧。","Har. You were well received."
"克莱昂特是的，但是她那时不知道我是谁，所以今天玛丽安娜见到我时，才会那么惊讶。","Cle. Very well, but without her knowing who I was; and that is why Marianne was so surprised when she saw me today."
"阿巴贡那你对她表白你的爱意，以及你愿意跟她结婚的意图了？","Har. Have you told her of your love, and of your intention of marrying her?"
"克莱昂特当然，我甚至跟她母亲透露过这个想法。","Cle. Certainly, and I also spoke a little to the mother on the subject."
"阿巴贡那她母亲也欣然接受了你对她女儿的求婚？","Har. Did she kindly receive your proposal for her daughter?"
"克莱昂特是的，欣然接受。","Cle. Yes, very kindly."
"阿巴贡那她女儿对你也有这个想法？","Har. And does the daughter return your love?"
"克莱昂特如果从表面上看，她肯定也对我有好感。","Cle. If I can believe appearances, she is certainly well disposed towards me."
"阿巴贡（旁白）很好！我很高兴知道了这个秘密，这也正是我想知道的。（对他儿子）现在，看着我，儿子，我告诉你该怎么做。你必须放弃对玛丽安娜的爱意，停止追求她，那是我要娶的姑娘，而且尽快跟我为你挑选的那个女人结婚。","Har. (aside). Well!I am very glad to have found out this secret; it is the very thing I wanted to know.  (To his son) Now, look here, my son, I tell you what.You will have, if you please, to get rid of your love for Marianne, to cease to pay your attentions to a person I intend for myself, and to marry very soon the wife I have chosen for you."
"克莱昂特好啊，父亲，您竟然这样骗我！很好，既然事情到了这个地步，我也向您宣布，我绝不会放弃对玛丽安娜的爱。绝不！所以请您理解，为了和您争夺这个姑娘，面临怎样的困难我也决不退缩。而且即使您已经得到她母亲的同意，我也会想出别的办法得到她。","Cle. So, father, it is thus you deceive me!Very well, since things are come to such a pass, I openly declare to you that I shall not give up my love for Marianne. No! understand that henceforth there is nothing from which I shall shrink in order to dispute her with you; and if you have on your side the consent of the mother, perhaps I shall have some other resources left to aid me."
"阿巴贡什么，混蛋！你竟敢跟你父亲我争夺？","Har. What, rascal!You dare to trespass on my grounds?"
"克莱昂特那是您先抢走了我的爱人，是我先爱上她的。","Cle. It is you who trespass on mine. I was the first."
"阿巴贡难道我不是你的父亲？你不应该尊重我吗？","Har. Am I not your father, and do you not owe me respect?"
"克莱昂特对某些事情，孩子是不需要尊重父亲的，而且爱情也不让位于对某人的尊重。","Cle. There are things in which children are not called upon to pay deference to their fathers; and love is no respector of persons."
"阿巴贡我用棍子揍你一顿，你就知道我是谁了。","Har. My stick will make you know me better."
"克莱昂特您怎么威胁都没用。","Cle. All your threatenings are nothing to me."
"阿巴贡你放不放弃玛丽安娜？","Har. You will give up Marianne?"
"克莱昂特绝不！","Cle. Never!"
"阿巴贡给我拿棍子来。我说快点！我要棍子！","Har. Bring me my stick. Quick, I say! my stick!"
"第四场——阿巴贡，克莱昂特，雅克师傅。","SCENE IV.——HARPAGON, CLÉANTE, MASTER JACQUES."
"雅克师傅慢着！慢着！先生们，你们要干吗？你们在想些什么？","Jac. Hold! hold!Gentlemen, what does this mean?What are you thinking of?"
"克莱昂特我才不关心呢。","Cle. I don’t care a bit for it."
"雅克师傅（对克莱昂特）啊！少爷，消消气。","Jac. (to Cléante). Ah!Sir, gently."
"阿巴贡他胆敢这样跟我说话，简直太放肆了！","Har. He dares to speak to me with such impudence as that!"
"雅克师傅（对阿巴贡）啊！老爷，我也求您了。","Jac. (to Harpagon). Ah!Sir, I beg of you."
"克莱昂特我决不放弃。","Cle. I shall keep to it."
"雅克师傅（对克莱昂特）什么！他可是您父亲！","Jac. (to Cléante). What! to your father?"
"阿巴贡我要揍他！","Har. Let me do it."
"雅克师傅（对阿巴贡）什么！他可是您儿子！要打，那您还是打我吧。","Jac. (to Harpagon). What! to your son?To me it’s different."
"阿巴贡我要你来评评这件事，雅克师傅，看清楚，我才是正确的那一方。","Har. I will make you judge between us, Master Jacques, so that you may see that I have right on my side."
"雅克师傅很乐意！（对克莱昂特）后退几步。","Jac. Willingly. (To Cléante) Go a little farther back."
"阿巴贡我爱上一个年轻姑娘，想跟她结婚，可这个兔崽子竟然也爱上了她，还想从我身边把她抢走，跟她结婚。","Har. There is a young girl I love and want to marry, and the scoundrel has the impudence to love her also, and wants to marry her in spite of me."
"雅克师傅哦！那是他的错。","Jac. Oh! he is wrong."
"阿巴贡为了一个女人，眼看自己的儿子要跟自己为敌，这难道不是可怕的事情吗？他要是真的尊重我，难道就不应该放弃我所爱的人吗？","Har. Is it not an abominable thing to see a son who does not shrink from becoming the rival of his father?And is it not his bounden duty to refrain from interfering with my love?"
"雅克师傅您很在理，先这样，让我过去跟他说说。","Jac. You are quite right; stop here, and let me go and speak to him."
"克莱昂特（对正在向他走来的雅克师傅）很好，既然他让你来评理，我没有异议。不管谁来评理，我都不怕。我也不介意讨论我跟他之间的分歧。","Cle. (to Master Jacques, who comes near him). Very well; if he wants to make you a judge between us, I have no objection. I care little who it is, and I don’t mind referring our quarrel to you."
"雅克师傅您真给我面子。","Jac. You do me great honour."
"克莱昂特我爱上一个年轻姑娘，她也爱我，也接受了我的爱，可是我的父亲却偏偏突然想到要结婚，并向她提出求婚。","Cle. I am in love with a young girl who returns my affection, and who receives kindly the offer of my heart; but my father takes it into his head to disturb our love by asking her in marriage."
"雅克师傅那就是他的不对。","Jac. He certainly is wrong."
"克莱昂特像他这种上了年纪的人，还想再结婚，难道不是件很不体面的事吗？我问你，他谈恋爱是对的吗？难道他不应该把这种事留给我们年轻人？","Cle. Is it not shameful for a man of his age to think of marrying?I ask you if it is right for him to fall in love? and ought he not now to leave that to younger men?"
"雅克师傅您说得真对，他简直在胡闹，让我跟他谈谈。（转身走向阿巴贡）说真的，您的儿子不是您想象中那么桀骜不驯，他还是讲理的。他说他意识到他不够尊重您，而且他刚才是气昏头了，一时冲动。他将愿意服从您的意愿，只要您答应尽量对他更友善些，而且帮他订桩他称心如意的婚事。","Jac. You are quite right; he is not serious; let me speak a word or two to him. (To Harpagon) Really, your son is not so extravagant as you think, and is amenable to reason. He says that he is conscious of the respect he owes you, and that he only got angry in the heat of the moment. He will willingly submit to all you wish if you will only promise to treat him more kindly than you do, and will give him in marriage a person to his taste."
"阿巴贡啊！告诉他，雅克师傅，他刚才说的我都能做到，而且，除了玛丽安娜，我会让他照自己的喜好选择妻子，我绝不干预。","Har. Ah!tell him, Master Jacques, that he will obtain everything from me on those terms, and that, except Marianne, I leave him free to choose for his wife whomsoever he pleases."
"雅克师傅好的，交给我了。（转身向克莱昂特）说真的，您父亲也不是您口中所说的那么不讲理，他跟我说，他那么生气完全是因为你刚才暴怒的态度。他只是看不惯您处理事务的方式，其实他准备按照您的心愿来办，只要您答应态度柔和些，像一个儿子一样多顺着他些，多尊敬他些，多孝敬他些。","Jac. Leave that to me. (To Cléante) Really, your father is not so unreasonable as you make him out to me; and he tells me that it is your violence which irritated him. He only objects to your way of doing things, and is quite ready to grant you all you want, provided you will use gentle means and will give him the deference, respect, and submission that a son owes to his father."
"克莱昂特啊！雅克师傅，你让他大可放心，只要他允许我和玛丽安娜结婚，我会做一个最乖巧的儿子，我绝不会再对着他干了。","Cle. Ah!Master Jacques, you can assure him that if he grants me Marianne, he will always find me the most submissive of men, and that I shall never do anything contrary to his pleasure."
"雅克师傅（向阿巴贡）说好了，他同意了您的条件。","Jac. (to Harpagon). It’s all right; he consents to what you say."
"阿巴贡这可太好了。","Har. Nothing could be better."
"雅克师傅（对克莱昂特）都说妥了，他很满意您的承诺。","Jac. (to Cléante). It’s all settled; he is satisfied with your promises."
"克莱昂特谢天谢地！","Cle. Heaven be praised!"
"雅克师傅先生们，这件事你们可以好好谈谈了。你们已经达成一致，之前的争执都是因为彼此的一点点误会。","Jac. Gentlemen, you have nothing to do but to talk quietly over the matter together; you are agreed now, and yet you were on the point of quarrelling through want of understanding each other."
"克莱昂特亲爱的雅克，我会一辈子都感谢你的。","Cle. My poor Jacques, I shall be obliged to you all my life."
"雅克师傅不足挂齿，少爷。","Jac. Don’t mention it, Sir."
"阿巴贡你让我太高兴了，雅克师傅，真该好好奖励你。（阿巴贡掏着荷包，雅克师傅伸出手，可阿巴贡只是从荷包里掏出手帕，并说）走吧，我不会忘记你的，我保证。","Har. You have given me great pleasure, Master Jacques, and deserve a reward. (Harpagon feels in his pocket, Jacques holds out his hand, but Harpagon only pulls out his handkerchief, and says,) Go; I will remember it, I promise you."
"雅克师傅真谢谢您，老爷。","Jac. I thank you kindly, Sir."
"第五场——阿巴贡，克莱昂特。","SCENE V.——HARPAGON, CLÉANTE."
"克莱昂特我请求您的原谅，父亲，我刚才太莽撞了。","Cle. I beg your pardon, father, for having been angry."
"阿巴贡没什么。","Har. It is nothing."
"克莱昂特我是真的为刚才的事感到抱歉。","Cle. I assure you that I feel very sorry about it."
"阿巴贡我也非常高兴看到你通情达理。","Har. I am very happy to see you reasonable again."
"克莱昂特您真是太善良了，这么快就忘了我的过错。","Cle. How very kind of you so soon to forget my fault."
"阿巴贡只要孩子能听话孝顺，做父辈的就没必要记恨。","Har. One easily forgets the faults of children when they return to their duty."
"克莱昂特什么！您对我刚才的过激行为一点都不记恨？","Cle. What! you are not angry with me for my extravagant behaviour?"
"阿巴贡既然你已经顺从我，也尊重我了，我自然就不责怪你啦。","Har. By your submission and respectful conduct you compel me to forget my anger."
"克莱昂特我向您保证，父亲，我会将您的善良牢记在心。","Cle. I assure you, father, I shall for ever keep in heart the remembrance of all your kindness."
"阿巴贡那我也向你承诺，以后你想要的一切我都会给你。","Har. And I promise you that, in future, you will obtain all you like from me."
"克莱昂特哦，父亲！只要您能把玛丽安娜给我，就足够了，我别无他求。","Cle. Oh, father!I ask nothing more; it is sufficient for me that you give me Marianne."
"阿巴贡什么？","Har. What?"
"克莱昂特我是说，父亲，我对您做的决定真是太感谢了，而且您把玛丽安娜给我，就是给了我一切。","Cle. I say, father, that I am only too thankful already for what you have done, and that when you give me Marianne, you give me everything."
"阿巴贡谁说要把玛丽安娜给你的？","Har. Who talks of giving you Marianne?"
"克莱昂特您啊，父亲。","Cle. You, father."
"阿巴贡我？","Har. I?"
"克莱昂特是的。","Cle. Yes."
"阿巴贡什么！不是你答应说放弃她的吗？","Har. What! is it not you who promised to give her up?"
"克莱昂特我！放弃她？","Cle. I! give her up?"
"阿巴贡是的。","Har. Yes."
"克莱昂特当然不。","Cle. Certainly not."
"阿巴贡你没有放弃跟她结婚的念头？","Har. Did you not give up all pretensions to her?"
"克莱昂特恰恰相反，我现在比以前更坚定了要娶她的决心。","Cle. On the contrary, I am more determined than ever to have her."
"阿巴贡什么？混账！又来跟我争？","Har. What, scoundrel! again?"
"克莱昂特任何事都不能改变我的决定。","Cle. Nothing can make me change my mind."
"阿巴贡看我怎么修理你，无赖！","Har. Let me get at you again, wretch!"
"克莱昂特随您怎么都行。","Cle. You can do as you please."
"阿巴贡我不许你再出现在我的面前。","Har. I forbid you ever to come within my sight."
"克莱昂特随您的便。","Cle. As you like."
"阿巴贡我不要你了。","Har. I abandon you."
"克莱昂特不要就不要。","Cle. Abandon me."
"阿巴贡我不认你了。","Har. I disown you."
"克莱昂特不认就不认。","Cle. Disown me."
"阿巴贡我剥夺你的继承权。","Har. I disinherit you."
"克莱昂特照您说的办。","Cle. As you will."
"阿巴贡我要诅咒你。","Har. I give you my curse."
"克莱昂特我不需要您的恩惠。","Cle. I want none of your gifts."
"第六场——克莱昂特，拉·弗莱什。","SCENE VI.——CLÉANTE, LA FLÈCHE."
"拉·弗莱什（捧着个匣子从花园走出来）啊！少爷，您来得真是时候。快，跟我来！","La Fl. (leaving the garden with a casket). Ah!Sir, you are just in the nick of time. Quick! follow me."
"克莱昂特发生什么事了？","Cle. What is the matter?"
"拉·弗莱什跟我来，我们有救了。","La Fl. Follow me, I say. We are saved."
"克莱昂特什么？","Cle. How?"
"拉·弗莱什这就是您想要的。","La Fl. Here is all you want."
"克莱昂特什么？","Cle. What?"
"拉·弗莱什我已经看着这个一整天了。","La Fl. I have watched for this all day."
"克莱昂特这是什么？","Cle. What is it?"
"拉·弗莱什您父亲的财富，我拿到手了。","La Fl. Your father’s treasure that I have got hold of."
"克莱昂特你怎么拿到的？","Cle. How did you manage it?"
"拉·弗莱什我会一五一十告诉您的，现在必须马上离开。我听到他在叫抓贼了。","La Fl. I will tell you all about it. Let us be off. I can hear him calling out."
"第七场——阿巴贡，从花园跑来，匆忙之中没戴帽子，一路叫喊着——","SCENE VII.——HARPAGON, from the garden, rushing in without his hat, and crying—"
"抓贼啊！抓贼啊！抓杀人犯啊！抓凶手啊！快叫法官来，天啊！我完蛋了，我被谋杀了，他们割破了我的喉咙，他们偷走了我的钱！这会是谁干的？他到底做了什么？他在哪儿？他藏在哪儿？我要怎么找到他？我该从哪里找起？不该从哪里找？他不在这里？是谁？别动！（自言自语，抓住自己的一只胳膊）把我的钱还给我，恶棍……啊……！是我自己……我真是昏了头了，我这是在哪儿，我是谁，我在干什么。啊！我亲爱的钱啊！我的宝贝啊！我最亲密的朋友，他们把你从我身边夺走，你这么一走，我便失去了依靠、安慰，还有我的快乐。我的一切都没了，我没有继续生活的理由了！没有你，我简直活不成啊。全完了，我实在受不了了。我快死了，我死了，我被埋葬了。没人愿意把我从鬼门关拖回来，把我的钱都还给我吗？或者，至少告诉我，是谁偷走了我的钱？啊！你说什么？没人偷。不管是谁干了这勾当，他一定是暗中监视策划许久，趁我跟我的不孝子谈话的空当下的手。我得马上离开。我要诉诸正义，要审问这里每一个人，包括女仆、男仆、我的儿子、我的女儿和我自己。来这儿的人可真多啊！每个人都可能是偷钱的贼。我看见谁都觉得可疑。嘿！他们在那边说什么呢？是他偷了我的钱？这边又在说什么？偷钱的贼在这里吗？老天爷啊，如果您知道这贼的下落，我恳求您告诉我吧。那贼就藏在人群中？他们都在看着我笑。我看出来了，钱被偷这事，他们都有份儿。快来啊！调查员、警官、宪兵、法官，还得搬来刑具、绞刑架，再叫刽子手来。我要绞死这儿的每个人，如果我抓不到偷钱的贼的话，我就绞死我自己。","Thieves! thieves! assassins! murder!Justice, just heavens!I am undone; I am murdered; they have cut my throat; they have stolen my money!Who can it be?What has become of him?Where is he?Where is he hiding himself?What shall I do to find him?Where shall I run?Where shall I not run?Is he not here?Who is this?Stop!(To himself, taking hold of his own arm) Give me back my money, wretch…. Ah…! it is myself…. My mind is wandering, and I know not where I am, who I am, and what I am doing. Alas! my poor money! my poor money! my dearest friend, they have bereaved me of thee; and since thou art gone, I have lost my support, my consolation, and my joy. All is ended for me, and I have nothing more to do in the world!Without thee it is impossible for me to live.It is all over with me; I can bear it no longer. I am dying; I am dead; I am buried.Is there nobody who will call me from the dead, by restoring my dear money to me, or by telling me who has taken it?Ah! what is it you say?It is no one. Whoever has committed the deed must have watched carefully for his opportunity, and must have chosen the very moment when I was talking with my miscreant of a son. I must go. I will demand justice, and have the whole of my house put to the torture—my maids and my valets, my son, my daughter, and myself too. What a crowd of people are assembled here!Everyone seems to be my thief. I see no one who does not rouse suspicion in me. Ha! what are they speaking of there?Of him who stole my money?What noise is that up yonder?Is it my thief who is there?For pity’s sake, if you know anything of my thief, I beseech you to tell me. Is he hiding there among you?They all look at me and laugh. We shall see that they all have a share in the robbery. Quick! magistrates, police, provosts, judges, racks, gibbets, and executioners. I will hang everybody, and if I do not find my money, I will hang myself afterwards."
"第五幕","ACT V."
"第一场——阿巴贡，一位警官。","SCENE I.——HARPAGON, A POLICE OFFICER."
"警官这事交给我了，这是我的职责。谢天谢地！这不是我第一次侦破这种盗窃案了，我倒是希望自己从中挣得的一千法郎荷包能跟我抓的窃贼一样多。","Off. Leave that to me. I know my business. Thank Heaven! this is not the first time I have been employed in finding out thieves; and I wish I had as many bags of a thousand francs as I have had people hanged."
"阿巴贡每个法官都必须审理这件案子，倘若我的钱找不回来，我连法官一起上告。","Har. Every magistrate must take this affair in hand; and if my money is not found, I shall call justice against justice itself."
"警官我们必须按照程序办事。你说那匣子里有……","Off. We must take all needful steps. You say there was in that casket…?"
"阿巴贡有现金一万克朗。","Har. Ten thousand crowns in cash."
"警官一万克朗！","Off. Ten thousand crowns!"
"阿巴贡是一万克朗。","Har. Ten thousand crowns."
"警官这可是大案子。","Off. A considerable theft."
"阿巴贡犯下如此滔天大罪，再怎么判刑都不为过。而且要是罪犯逍遥法外的话，那么这世上最神圣的东西都失去了保障。","Har. There is no punishment great enough for the enormity of the crime; and if it remain unpunished, the most sacred things are no longer secure."
"警官里边都有哪些币种？","Off. In what coins was that sum?"
"阿巴贡货真价实的金路易，还有成色十足的皮斯托尔。","Har. In good louis d’or and pistoles of full weight."
"警官你怀疑是谁偷的？","Off. Whom do you suspect of this robbery?"
"阿巴贡所有人。我希望你把城里城外的人都关起来审讯。","Har. Everybody. I wish you to take into custody the whole town and suburbs."
"警官如果你信任我，你就不能惊动任何人，必须暗地里慢慢搜集证据，顺藤摸瓜，最后再用严厉的手段把被偷走的钱追回来。","Off. You must not, if you trust me, frighten anybody, but must use gentle means to collect evidence, in order afterwards to proceed with more rigour for the recovery of the sum which has been taken from you."
"第二场——阿巴贡，警官，雅克师傅。","SCENE II.——HARPAGON, THE POLICE OFFICER, MASTER JACQUES."
"雅克师傅（在舞台尽头，背对着刚才进来的门，面朝门里）我回来了。先一刀把它宰了，把它的蹄子烤焦，再把它放开水里煮，最后把它吊在楼板上。","Jac. (at the end of the stage, turning back to the door by which he came in). I am coming back. Have his throat cut at once; have his feet singed; put him in boiling water, and hang him up to the ceiling."
"阿巴贡什么！他就是偷我钱的那家伙？","Har. What!Him who has robbed me?"
"雅克师傅我说的是您管家刚才送来的乳猪，我打算按照我的想法给您露一手。","Jac. I was speaking of a sucking pig that your steward has just sent me; and I want to have it dressed for you after my own fancy."
"阿巴贡我没跟你说这个，你先跟这位先生谈谈别的事情。","Har. This is no longer the question; and you have to speak of something else to this gentleman."
"警官（对雅克师傅）别害怕。我不是那种靠不住的人，这事我会处理得和和气气，有条不紊。","Off. (to Jacques). Don’t get frightened. I am not a man to cause any scandal, and matters will be carried on by gentle means."
"雅克师傅（对阿巴贡）这位先生也留下来吃晚饭吗？","Jac. (to Harpagon). Is this gentleman coming to supper with you?"
"警官伙计，就这件事，你不得对你的主人有任何隐瞒。","Off. You must, in this case, my good man, hide nothing from your master."
"雅克师傅当然，先生，我会把我的本事都拿出来，也会尽我所能把您照顾好。","Jac. Indeed, Sir, I will show you all I know, and will treat you in the best manner I possibly can."
"警官我说的不是这件事。","Off. That’s not the question."
"雅克师傅要是我做出来的饭菜不合胃口，那也是您管家的不对，他只顾着省钱，我都无法施展厨艺。","Jac. If I do not give as good fare as I should like, it is the fault of your steward, who has clipped my wings with the scissors of his economy."
"阿巴贡混蛋！我们在说跟做饭没有关系的事，我想要你说出我那笔被偷走的钱的下落。","Har. Rascal!We have other matters to talk about than your supper; and I want you to tell me what has become of the money which has been stolen from me."
"雅克师傅有人偷您的钱？","Jac. Some money has been stolen from you?"
"阿巴贡是的，你这个混蛋！如果你不把钱还给我，我就把你绞死。","Har. Yes, you rascal!And I’ll have you hanged if you don’t give it me back again."
"警官（对阿巴贡）天啊，你别对他这么严厉。从他的样子，我看得出来他是个诚实的人，他会告诉你他知道的一切，这样他就不会为此进监狱。是的，我的朋友，如果你说实话，你不用吃任何苦头，而且你的主人还会为此奖赏你呢。今天他的钱被偷了，你应该知道有关这件事的情况。","Off. (to Harpagon). Pray, don’t be hard upon him.I see by his looks that he is an honest fellow, and that he will tell you all you want to know without going to prison. Yes, my friend, if you confess, no harm shall come to you, and you shall be well rewarded by your master. Some money has been stolen from him, and it is not possible that you know nothing about it."
"雅克师傅（旁白）现在正是我报复管家的好机会。自从他来到这儿，他很得宠，事事都听他的。而且，我可没忘，今天他刚打了我几棍子……","Jac. (aside). The very thing I wanted in order to be revenged of our steward. Ever since he came here, he has been the favourite, and his advice is the only one listened to. Moreover, I have forgotten neither the cudgelling of to-day nor …"
"阿巴贡你在那儿嘀咕什么呢？","Har. What are you muttering about there?"
"警官（对阿巴贡）让他仔细想想，他正考虑怎么说呢，我告诉过你他是一个诚实的人。","Off. (to Harpagon). Leave him alone. He is preparing himself to satisfy you; I told you that he was an honest fellow."
"雅克师傅老爷，既然您让我把我所知道的事情告诉您，我跟您说吧，这钱是您的管家给偷走的。","Jac. Sir, since you want me to tell you what I know, I believe it is your steward who has done this."
"阿巴贡瓦莱尔？","Har. Valère?"
"雅克师傅是的。","Jac. Yes."
"阿巴贡可他一直对我忠心耿耿啊！","Har. He who seemed so faithful to me!"
"雅克师傅就是他！我坚信就是他把您的钱给偷走了。","Jac. Himself. I believe that it is he who has robbed you."
"阿巴贡你为什么认定是他？","Har. And what makes you believe it?"
"雅克师傅我为什么认定是他？","Jac. What makes me believe it?"
"阿巴贡是呀。","Har. Yes."
"雅克师傅我坚信是他……因为我坚信是他。","Jac. I believe it … because I believe it."
"警官可你必须得有根据才行。","Off. But you must tell us the proofs you have."
"阿巴贡难道你看见他在我藏钱的地方晃悠？","Har. Did you see him hanging about the place where I had put my money?"
"雅克师傅是的，看见过。您把钱藏哪了？","Jac. Yes, indeed. Where was your money?"
"阿巴贡花园里。","Har. In the garden."
"雅克师傅没错，我曾见过他一直在花园周围徘徊。您的钱装哪儿了？","Jac. Exactly; I saw him loitering about in the garden; and in what was your money?"
"阿巴贡在一个匣子里。","Har. In a casket."
"雅克师傅这就对了。我看见他有一个匣子。","Jac. The very thing. I saw him with a casket."
"阿巴贡那这个匣子，是什么样儿的？我要看看是不是和我的一样。","Har. And this casket, what was it like?I shall soon see if it is mine."
"雅克师傅什么样儿的？","Jac. What it was like?"
"阿巴贡是的。","Har. Yes."
"雅克师傅它是……它就是个匣子的样子嘛。","Jac. It was like … like a casket."
"警官当然。你得描述得详细些，要弄清楚是不是失窃的那个。","Off. Of course. But describe it a little, to see if it is the same."
"雅克师傅那是个很大的匣子。","Jac. It was a large casket."
"阿巴贡可偷走的是个小匣子。","Har. The one taken from me is a small one."
"雅克师傅是的，我说大是说里面装的钱，就匣子而言是算小的。","Jac. Yes, small if you look at it in that way; but I call it large because of what it contains."
"阿巴贡那匣子是什么颜色？","Har. And what colour was it?"
"雅克师傅什么颜色？","Jac. What colour?"
"警官是的。","Off. Yes."
"雅克师傅这个颜色……就是某一种……您帮我想想那颜色叫什么？","Jac. Of a colour … of a certain colour…. Can’t you help me to find the word?"
"阿巴贡啊！","Har. Ugh!"
"雅克师傅红色，是吧？","Jac. Red; isn’t it?"
"阿巴贡不是，是灰色。","Har. No, grey."
"雅克师傅哈！是的，就是灰红灰红的颜色。我就是指的这个颜色。","Jac. Ha! yes, reddish-grey!That’s what I meant."
"阿巴贡现在水落石出了，那就是我被偷走的匣子。快把他的证词记下来，先生。天啊！我们以后还能信任谁？以后不能对任何事断言了。现在我都会怀疑自己偷自己东西啦。","Har. There is no doubt about it, it’s my casket for certain. Write down his evidence, Sir!Heavens! whom can we trust after that?We must never swear to anything, and I believe now that I might rob my own self."
"雅克师傅（对阿巴贡）他来了，老爷，我请求您，千万别告诉他是我把他抖搂出来的。","Jac. (to Harpagon). There he is coming back, Sir; I beg of you not to go and tell him that it was I who let it all out, Sir."
"第三场——阿巴贡，警官，瓦莱尔，雅克师傅。","SCENE III.——HARPAGON, THE POLICE OFFICER, VALÈRE, MASTER JACQUES."
"阿巴贡过来，走近点，承认吧，这是有史以来最卑鄙的行为，是最残忍的犯罪。","Har.Come, come near, and confess the most abominable action, the most horrible crime, that was ever committed."
"瓦莱尔您什么意思，老爷？","Val. What do you want, Sir?"
"阿巴贡什么，叛徒！你犯下如此罪行难道都不脸红吗？","Har. What, wretch! you do not blush for shame after such a crime?"
"瓦莱尔您在说什么罪行？","Val. Of what crime do you speak?"
"阿巴贡我在说什么罪行？卑鄙无耻的小人，别装得听不懂我在说什么！你已无需再隐藏了，事情已经被揭发了，有人已经告诉我整件事的来龙去脉了。你怎能背叛我的一片好心，打着仆人的幌子潜入我家，想出这个鬼把戏来蒙蔽我？","Har. Of what crime I speak?Base villain, as if you did not know what I mean!It is in vain for you to try to hide it; the thing is discovered, and I have just heard all the particulars. How could you thus abuse my kindness, introduce yourself on purpose into my house to betray me, and to play upon me such an abominable trick?"
"瓦莱尔老爷，既然您已经全部知道了，那我对我所做的事不再否认，也不再隐瞒了。","Val. Sir, since everything is known to you, I will neither deny what I have done nor will I try to palliate it."
"雅克师傅（旁白）哦！哦！真让我猜对了？","Jac. (aside). Oh! oh!Have I guessed the truth?"
"瓦莱尔我本来打算告诉您的，但我还在等待合适的时机。可是，这已经不可能了，我请求您不要生气，先听我解释我的动机。","Val. I intended to speak to you about it, and I was watching for a favourable opportunity; but, as this is no longer possible, I beg of you not to be angry, and to hear my motives."
"阿巴贡这无耻的窃贼，你能说出什么好的理由？","Har. And what fine motives can you possibly give me, infamous thief?"
"瓦莱尔啊！老爷，您凭什么这么称呼我。我的确有不对的地方，可毕竟，我的错误是可以原谅的。","Val. Ah!Sir, I do not deserve these names. I am guilty towards you, it is true; but, after all, my fault is pardonable."
"阿巴贡什么叫可以原谅？这是个精心策划的阴谋，是不折不扣的谋杀！","Har. How pardonable?A premeditated trick, and such an assassination as this!"
"瓦莱尔我恳求您，不要发这么大火。当您听完我要说的话，您就会明白这没有您想象中那么严重。","Val. I beseech you not to be so angry with me. When you have heard all I have to say, you will see that the harm is not so great as you make it out to be."
"阿巴贡这没有我想象中那么严重！什么！那是我的心肝宝贝，混账！","Har. The harm not so great as I make it out to be!What!my heart’s blood, scoundrel!"
"瓦莱尔老爷，您的心肝宝贝，可并没有落入坏人之手。我的地位是绝不可能使她蒙羞的，而且我愿为这件事做任何补偿。","Val. Your blood, Sir, has not fallen into bad hands.My rank is high enough not to disgrace it, and there is nothing in all this for which reparation cannot be made."
"阿巴贡是的，确实。我想，你应该把从我这儿偷走的东西还给我。","Har. It is, indeed, my intention that you should restore what you have taken from me."
"瓦莱尔老爷，您的名誉不会受到任何的损害。","Val. Your honour, Sir, shall be fully satisfied."
"阿巴贡这和我的名誉没有关系。但是告诉我，是谁指使你犯下这样的罪行？","Har. Honour is not the question in all this.But tell me what made you commit such a deed?"
"瓦莱尔唉！您问我这个？","Val. Alas!do you ask it?"
"阿巴贡是的，我当然想知道。","Har. Yes, I should rather think that I do."
"瓦莱尔是一个神，老爷，他指点人们做的任何事都能被原谅，这件事就是爱情。","Val. A god, Sir, who carries with him his excuses for all he makes people do: Love."
"阿巴贡爱情？","Har. Love?"
"瓦莱尔是的。","Val. Yes."
"阿巴贡多美好的爱情！真是美好的爱情！是对我的金钱的爱情！","Har. Fine love that! fine love, indeed! the love of my gold!"
"瓦莱尔不是的，老爷，不是您的财富让我心动的，我不是一个见钱眼开的人，而且我发誓，我绝不贪恋您的丁点财产，只要您把属于我的留给我。","Val. No, Sir, it is not your wealth that has tempted me, it is not that which has dazzled me; and I swear never to pretend to any of your possessions, provided you leave me what I have."
"阿巴贡以所有恶魔的名义，绝不，我绝不把它留给你。可从没见过你这样厚颜无耻的人！他还妄想要把从我这儿偷走的东西留下来！","Har. In the name of all the devils, no, I shall not leave it to you. But did anyone ever meet with such villainy!He wishes to keep what he has robbed me of!"
"瓦莱尔您说我是在偷？","Val. Do you call that a robbery?"
"阿巴贡这不是偷是什么？那是我的宝贝！","Har. If I call that a robbery?A treasure like that!"
"瓦莱尔我知道这的确是宝贝，而且是您最最珍贵的宝贝。可是您留给我并不会给您带来任何损失。我跪下来请求您，把这让我心驰神往的宝贝留给我。留给我才是您正确的做法啊。","Val. I readily acknowledge that it is a treasure, and the most precious one you have. But it will not be losing it to leave it to me.I ask you on my knees to leave in my possession this treasure so full of charms; and if you do right, you will grant it to me."
"阿巴贡我才不会那样做。你究竟是想干吗？","Har. I will do nothing of the kind. What in the world are you driving at?"
"瓦莱尔我们已经彼此许诺，并发誓从此不离不弃。","Val. We have pledged our faith to each other, and have taken an oath never to forsake one another."
"阿巴贡这个发誓值得敬佩，但这个承诺可笑至极！","Har. The oath is admirable, and the promise strange enough!"
"瓦莱尔是的，我们已决定生生世世永不分开。","Val. Yes, we are engaged to each other for ever."
"阿巴贡我非常清楚怎么能让你们分开，我说到做到。","Har. I know pretty well how to disengage you, I assure you of that."
"瓦莱尔只有死才能让我们分开。","Val. Nothing but death can separate us."
"阿巴贡你简直想我的钱都想疯啦。","Har. You must be devilishly bewitched by my money."
"瓦莱尔我已经跟您说过，老爷，我这么做完全不是因为私利。不是私利驱使着我的心，是一种更加崇高的动机鼓舞着我。","Val. I have told you already, Sir, that it is not self-interest which has prompted me to what I have done. It was not that which prompted my heart; a nobler motive inspired me."
"阿巴贡我们都听到了，你是想以基督徒做慈善为由来占领我的财产！但是我不会让你得逞的，你这厚颜无耻的家伙，法庭会为我做出满意的判决。","Har. We shall hear presently that it is out of Christian charity that he covets my money!But I will put a stop to all this, and justice, impudent rascal, will soon give me satisfaction."
"瓦莱尔您随便怎样都行，无论您使用怎样的酷刑我都能承受，老爷，但是请求您，如果有任何不幸发生，至少要相信，我才是有罪的一方，而您的女儿在这件事上没有任何过错。","Val. You will do as you please, and I am ready to suffer all the violence you care to inflict upon me, but I beg of you to believe, at least, that if there is any harm done, I am the only one guilty, and that your daughter has done nothing wrong in all this."
"阿巴贡我当然相信。要是我女儿跟这件事有瓜葛的话，这也太离奇了。但是我要你归还我的宝贝，你必须坦白你把它带到什么地方去了。（此处有大量魅化的信息未能翻译出来，因为需要时而指代它，即钱匣子，时而指代她，即埃莉斯。）","Har. I should think not!It would be strange, indeed, if my daughter had a share in this crime. But I will have that treasure back again, and you must confess to what place you have carried it off. (A good deal of the mystification is lost in the translation through the necessity of occasionally putting it for casket, and she for Élise.)"
"瓦莱尔我没带到哪里去啊，她还在您家里呀。","Val. I have not carried it off, and it is still in your house."
"阿巴贡（旁白）哦，我亲爱的匣子！（对瓦莱尔）我的宝贝没离开我家？","Har. (aside). O my beloved casket!(To Valère) My treasure has not left my house?"
"瓦莱尔没有，老爷。","Val. No, Sir."
"阿巴贡那好，那告诉我，你有没有动过……？","Har. Well, then, tell me, have you taken any liberties with…?"
"瓦莱尔啊！老爷，您误会我们了，我内心燃烧的感情是非常纯洁、充满尊重的爱情。","Val. Ah!Sir, you wrong us both; the flame with which I burn is too pure, too full of respect."
"阿巴贡（旁白）他爱上了我的匣子！","Har. (aside). He burns for my casket!"
"瓦莱尔我宁愿死也不会有任何伺机冒犯的邪念。她是如此羞怯，如此纯洁。","Val. I had rather die than show the least offensive thought: I found too much modesty and too much purity for that."
"阿巴贡（旁白）我的钱匣子羞怯！","Har. (aside). My cash-box modest!"
"瓦莱尔我所有的愿望就是能够时刻看到她，她那双美丽的眼睛令我着迷，这是没有邪念、没有杂质的感情。","Val. All my desires were limited to the pleasures of sight, and nothing criminal has profaned the passion those fair eyes have inspired me with."
"阿巴贡（旁白）我的匣子还有一双美丽的眼睛！他说起这个匣子就像是在跟他情人对话。","Har. (aside). The fair eyes of my cash-box!He speaks of it as a lover does of his mistress."
"瓦莱尔克洛德夫人也知道此事的真相，她可以作证。","Val. Dame Claude knows the whole truth, and she can bear witness to it."
"阿巴贡嘿！我的仆人也是这件事的同谋？","Har. Hallo!my servant is an accomplice in this affair?"
"瓦莱尔是的，老爷，她是我们私定终身的见证人。就是她，在了解了我纯洁的感情后，帮助我说服了您的女儿接受我的求婚。","Val. Yes, Sir, she was a witness to our engagement; and it was after being sure of the innocence of my love that she helped me to persuade your daughter to engage herself to me."
"阿巴贡啊！（旁白）是不是这法庭让他失去理智了？（对瓦莱尔）你干吗把我女儿牵扯进来？","Har. Ah!(Aside) Has the fear of justice made him lose his senses?(To Valère) What rubbish are you talking about my daughter?"
"瓦莱尔老爷，我是说，我付出了很大的努力才最终使得她放下羞怯，接受了我的感情。","Val. I say, Sir, that I found it most difficult to make her modesty consent to what my love asked of her."
"阿巴贡谁放下羞怯？","Har. The modesty of whom?"
"瓦莱尔您的女儿啊。她直到昨天才下定决心签订了我们俩的婚约。","Val. Of your daughter; and it was only yesterday that she could make up her mind to sign our mutual promise of marriage."
"阿巴贡我的女儿在婚约上签字啦？","Har. My daughter has signed a promise of marriage?"
"瓦莱尔是的，老爷，我也签字了。","Val. Yes, Sir, and I have also signed."
"阿巴贡哦，天啊！这倒霉事一桩接一桩！","Har. O heavens!another misfortune!"
"雅克师傅（对警官）写下来，先生，写下来。","Jac. (to the Officer). Write, Sir, write."
"阿巴贡厄运不断！祸不单行！（对警官）先生，履行你的职责，快帮我起草诉状，我要告他盗窃，还诱拐少女。","Har. Aggravation of misery!Excess of despair!(To the Officer) Sir, discharge your duty, and draw me up an indictment against him as a thief and a suborner."
"雅克师傅他盗窃，还诱拐少女。","Jac. As a thief and a suborner."
"瓦莱尔这些罪名都不该加在我的身上，当您知道我是谁后……","Val. These are names which I do not deserve, and when you know who I am …"
"第四场——阿巴贡，埃莉斯，玛丽安娜，瓦莱尔，弗罗辛娜，雅克师傅，警官。","SCENE IV.——HARPAGON, ÉLISE, MARIANNE, VALÈRE, FROSINE, MASTER JACQUES, THE POLICE OFFICER."
"阿巴贡啊！不孝的女儿！真不配有我这样的父亲！难道你就是这样遵从我对你的教训吗？你居然爱上了一个无耻的窃贼，而且你不经过我的同意就与他许诺终生！但是，你们两个得失望了。（对埃莉斯）我要把你关在屋子里，让你悔悟你所做的事。（对瓦莱尔）还有你，无耻的窃贼，绞刑架会替我修理你的胆大妄为。","Har. Ah! guilty daughter! unworthy of a father like me! is it thus that you put into practice the lessons I have given you?You give your love to an infamous thief, and engage yourself to him without my consent!But you shall both be disappointed. (To Élise) Four strong walls will answer for your conduct in the future; (to Valère) and good gallows, impudent thief, shall do me justice for your audacity."
"瓦莱尔您的怒火不能左右这件事，至少，您得听我说完我的理由之后再做判决。","Val. Your anger will be no judge in this affair, and I shall at least have a hearing before I am condemned."
"阿巴贡让你上绞刑架是我便宜你了，你该活活被车轮碾死。","Har. I was wrong to say gallows; you shall be broken alive on the wheel."
"埃莉斯（跪在父亲面前）啊！父亲，您发发善心，我请求您了，不要利用您做父亲的权利，把事情做得太绝了。不要凭您一时的愤怒失去理智，请您三思而后行啊。您稍安勿躁，仔细观察一下这个冒犯您的人。他不是您想象中的那样，而且如果您知道要是没有他，您早就失去我这个女儿的话，您就不会这么惊奇我跟他以身相许了。是的，父亲，在我落水的时候，就是他冒着生命危险救起了我，正是他挽回了您女儿的一条命……","Eli. (kneeling to her father). Ah! my father, be more merciful, I beseech you, and do not let your paternal authority drive matters to extremes.Do not suffer yourself to be carried away by the first outburst of your anger, but give yourself time to consider what you do. Take the trouble of inquiring about him whose conduct has offended you. He is not what you imagine, and you will think it less strange that I should have given myself to him, when you know that without him you would long ago have lost me for ever. Yes, father, it is he who saved me from the great danger I ran in the waters, and to whom you owe the life of that very daughter who …"
"阿巴贡这不算什么。我宁愿你淹死在水里，也不愿看到他做出这种事情。","Har. All this is nothing; and it would have been much better for me if he had suffered you to be drowned rather than do what he has done."
"埃莉斯我的父亲，我恳求您，看在您是我父亲的份上，就允许我……","Eli. My father, I beseech you, in the name of paternal love, grant me …"
"阿巴贡不，不。我什么都不听，法庭会做出判决的。","Har. No, no. I will hear nothing, and justice must have its course."
"雅克师傅（旁白）你会为刚才揍我的那顿付出代价的。","Jac. (aside). You shall pay me for the blows you gave me."
"弗罗辛娜这真是件棘手的事情！","Fro. What a perplexing state of affairs!"
"第五场——安塞尔姆，阿巴贡，埃莉斯，玛丽安娜，弗罗辛娜，警官，雅克师傅。","SCENE V.——ANSELME, HARPAGON, ÉLISE, MARIANNE, FROSINE, VALÈRE, THE POLICE OFFICER, MASTER JACQUES."
"安塞尔姆发生了什么事，阿巴贡先生？您看起来非常气愤。","Ans. What can have happened, Mr. Harpagon?You are quite upset."
"阿巴贡啊，安塞尔姆先生，您眼前的我就是世界上最不幸的人。您一定无法想象，我们签订的婚约现在变得如此让人恼火和混乱！我的财产被盗窃了，我的名誉也被损坏了。而且您看，就是这个混账无赖，侵犯了最圣洁的权利，佯装成仆人混进我家，就为了偷我的钱，拐骗我的女儿。","Har. Ah, Mr. Anselme, you see in me the most unfortunate of men; and you can never imagine what vexation and disorder is connected with the contract you have come to sign!I am attacked in my property; I am attacked in my honour; and you see there a scoundrel and a wretch who has violated the most sacred rights, who has introduced himself into my house as a servant in order to steal my money, and seduce my daughter."
"瓦莱尔别大呼小叫，谁想过要去偷您的钱？","Val. Who ever thought of your money about which you rave?"
"阿巴贡确实是。他们还彼此私定终身。这也是对您的侮辱，安塞尔姆先生，您应该出面告他，不惜任何代价起诉并严厉制裁他，来报复他的所作所为。","Har. Yes; they have given each other a promise of marriage. This insult concerns you, Mr. Anselme; and it is you who ought to be plaintiff against him, and who at your own expense ought to prosecute him to the utmost, in order to be revenged."
"安塞尔姆我可不想强迫别人嫁给我，也不想得到心有所属的人。可是只要关系到您的利益，我会像对待自己的利益一样站在您这边的。","Ans. It is not my intention to force anybody to marry me, and to lay claim to a heart which has already bestowed itself; but as far as your interests are concerned, I am ready to espouse them as if they were my own."
"阿巴贡这位先生是一名诚实的警官，他向我保证绝对秉公执法。（对着警官，指着瓦莱尔）处决他，先生，他罪有应得，让他背上重罪。","Har. This is the gentleman, an honest commissary, who has promised that he will omit nothing of what concerns the duties of his office. (To the Officer, showing Valère) Charge him, Sir, as he ought to be, and make matters very criminal."
"瓦莱尔我不明白我对您女儿的一片痴心到底犯了什么罪，也不明白我们许诺终生会带给我怎样的酷刑，当您知道我是谁后……","Val. I do not see what crime they can make of my passion for your daughter, nor the punishment you think I ought to be condemned to for our engagement; when it is known who I am …"
"阿巴贡我才不相信你说的这些话。现如今，这世界满是冒充贵族的骗子，他们利用自己的不明身份，随便在前面加上个地位显赫的家族名字，来显示自己的不凡身世。","Har. I don’t care a pin for all those stories, and the world is full, nowadays, of those pretenders to nobility, of those impostors, who take advantage of their obscurity and deck themselves out insolently with the first illustrious name that comes into their head."
"瓦莱尔您要知道我是正直诚实的人，不会往自己头上扣其他家族的帽子，而且那不勒斯全城的人都能证明我的出生！","Val. Know that I am too upright to adorn myself with a name which is not mine, and that all Naples can bear testimony to my birth!"
"安塞尔姆别激动！当心你要说的话。站在你面前的这个人可是非常熟悉那不勒斯城的，你的故事是真是假马上就能分明。","Ans. Softly!Take care of what you are about to say. You speak before a man to whom all Naples is known, and who can soon see if your story is true."
"瓦莱尔（自豪地戴上帽子）我没有什么可害怕的，如果您真的熟悉那不勒斯城，就应该知道堂托马·达尔布西是谁。","Val. (proudly putting on his hat). I am not the man to fear anything; and if all Naples is known to you, you know who was Don Thomas d’Alburci."
"安塞尔姆当然知道，我比任何人都要了解他。","Ans. Certainly; I know who he is, and few people know him better than I do."
"阿巴贡不管是堂托马，还是堂马丁，都跟我没关系。（看到两支蜡烛燃着，他吹灭了一支。）","Har. I care neither for Don Thomas nor Don Martin. (Seeing two candles burning, he blows one out.)"
"安塞尔姆耐心点，让他把话说完，我们很快就知道他是谁了。","Ans. Have patience and let him speak; we shall soon know what he has to say of him."
"瓦莱尔就是他给了我生命。","Val. That it is to him that I owe my birth."
"安塞尔姆是他？","Ans. To him?"
"瓦莱尔是的。","Val. Yes."
"安塞尔姆胡说八道，你简直在开玩笑。再试试编一个更有说服力的故事，别指望用这样的谎言来救你。","Ans. Nonsense; you are laughing. Try and make out a more likely story, and don’t pretend to shelter yourself under such a piece of imposture."
"瓦莱尔说这话之前请想清楚了。这不是谎言，我会证明我所说的一切。","Val. Consider your words better before you speak; it is no imposture, and I say nothing here that I cannot prove."
"安塞尔姆什么！你敢说自己是堂托马·达尔布西的儿子？","Ans. What!You dare to call yourself the son of Don Thomas d’Alburci?"
"瓦莱尔是的，我敢说，而且不管当着谁的面，我都敢这样说。","Val. Yes, I dare to do so; and I am ready to maintain the truth against anyone, who ever he may be."
"安塞尔姆你真是胆大包天。让我揭穿你吧，你说的这个人，还有他的妻子、孩子，死于至少十六年前的海难中。当时他们是为了躲避那不勒斯城的暴乱，这场暴乱导致一些贵族家庭被驱逐出境。","Ans. This audacity is marvellous. Learn to your confusion that it is now at least sixteen years ago since the man of whom you speak died in a shipwreck at sea with his wife and children, when he was trying to save their lives from the cruel persecutions which accompanied the troubles at Naples, and which caused the banishment of several noble families."
"瓦莱尔是的，但是您不知道的一些事情让我告诉您吧。他七岁的儿子，还有一个仆人，都被一艘西班牙船从海难中给救了，而站在这里跟您说话的就是他的儿子。而后这艘船的船长，非常同情我的遭遇，对我悉心照料，待我像他的亲生儿子一样。之后当我会用兵器了，他就送我去参军服役。就在不久前，我得知我的父亲并没有去世，这跟我想的一样。然后，就在我寻找父亲，路经这里的时候，一个意外，上天安排的意外发生了，我遇见了迷人的埃莉斯。第一眼看到她，我就被她的美貌所征服。我的爱是那么强烈，而她的父亲却又是那么残酷，于是我决定佯装成一位仆人混进她的家，然后另外派了人继续去寻找我的父亲。","Val. Yes; but learn to your confusion that his son, seven years of age, was, with a servant, saved from the wreck by a Spanish vessel, and that this son is he who now speaks to you. Learn that the captain of that ship, touched with compassion at my misfortune, loved me; that he had me brought up as his own son, and that the profession of arms has been my occupation ever since I was fit for it; that lately I heard that my father is not dead, as I thought he was; that, passing this way to go and find him out, an accident, arranged by heaven, brought to my sight the charming Élise; that the sight of her made me a slave to her beauty, and that the violence of my love and the harshness of her father made me take the resolution to come into his house disguised as a servant, and to send some one else to look after my parents."
"安塞尔姆可是除此之外，你还有其他证据，能证实这是真的，而不是你凭空捏造的吗？","Ans. But what other proofs have you besides your own words that all this is not a fable based by you upon truth."
"瓦莱尔什么证据？就是那艘西班牙船的船长，还有我父亲留下来的一颗红宝石印章，我母亲为我戴上的一串玛瑙手镯，以及跟我一起在海难中顺利逃生的老佩德罗。","Val. What proofs?The captain of the Spanish vessel; a ruby seal which belonged to my father; an agate bracelet which my mother put upon my arm; and old Pedro, that servant who was saved with me from the wreck."
"玛丽安娜天啊！听了你刚才的话，我可以证实你没有对我们撒谎。而且你所说的话让我明确认出，你就是我的哥哥。","Mar. Alas!I can answer here for what you have said; that you do not deceive us; and all you say clearly tells me that you are my brother."
"瓦莱尔你是我的妹妹！","Val. You my sister!"
"玛丽安娜是的，你一开口说话的时候，我就压抑不住内心的激动。我们的母亲要是见到你，一定会非常惊喜的，她经常给我讲我们家族在海难中的悲惨遭遇。我们也在海难中活了下来，可是失去了自由，因为我们在破船板上漂流的时候被海盗俘获了。经过十年的劳役，我们才有幸遇到一个机会重获自由。当我们返回那不勒斯城后，发现我们所有的家产都被卖掉了，也打听不到父亲的消息。我们便坐船去了热那亚，母亲得到一点已被瓜分所剩无几的财产。为了逃离她那些亲戚不公正的待遇，她来到这里，过着非常艰难的生活。","Mar. Yes, my heart was touched as soon as you began to speak; and our mother, who will be delighted at seeing you, often told me of the misfortunes of our family. Heaven spared us also in that dreadful wreck; but our life was spared at the cost of our liberty, for my mother and myself were taken up by pirates from the wreck of our vessel. After ten years of slavery a lucky event gave us back to liberty, and we returned to Naples, where we found all our property sold, and could hear no news of our father. We embarked for Genoa, where my mother went to gather what remained of a family estate which had been much disputed. Leaving her unjust relatives, she came here, where she has lived but a weary life."
"安塞尔姆哦，上帝啊！您是多么的伟大，只有您才能创造出这样的奇迹！到我怀里来，我的孩子们，我们一起享受全家团聚的喜悦吧！","Ans. O heaven! how wonderful are thy doings, and how true it is that it only belongs to thee to work miracles!Come to my arms, my children, and share the joy of your happy father!"
"瓦莱尔您是我们的父亲？","Val. You are our father?"
"玛丽安娜我母亲就是为您伤心痛哭的？","Mar. It was for you that my mother wept?"
"安塞尔姆是的，我的女儿，是的，我的儿子，我就是堂托马·达尔布西。上天把他和他的财产从海难中拯救了出来。十六年后，他以为你们都已不在人世，所以长途奔波后准备迎娶一位温柔善良的姑娘，建立一个新的家庭以求慰藉。一想到回那不勒斯城，我的生命安全没有保证，我便打消了回去的念头，并想方设法变卖了我的财产，定居在了这里，用了安塞尔姆这个名字。我希望忘却之前那个名字所带来的那么多的痛苦和麻烦。","Ans. Yes, my daughter; yes, my son; I am Don Thomas d’Alburci, whom heaven saved from the waves, with all the money he had with him, and who, after sixteen years, believing you all dead, was preparing, after long journeys, to seek the consolations of a new family in marrying a gentle and virtuous woman. The little security there was for my life in Naples has made me abandon the idea of returning there, and having found the means of selling what I had, I settled here under the name of Anselme. I wished to forget the sorrows of a name associated with so many and great troubles."
"阿巴贡（对安塞尔姆）他是您的儿子？","Har. (to Anselme). He is your son?"
"安塞尔姆是的。","Ans. Yes."
"阿巴贡太好了，那他从我这儿偷走的一万克朗就由您来赔偿吧。","Har. That being so, I make you responsible for the ten thousand crowns that he has stolen from me."
"安塞尔姆他偷了您的钱？","Ans. He steal anything from you!"
"阿巴贡是的。","Har. Yes."
"瓦莱尔谁说是我偷的？","Val. Who said so?"
"阿巴贡雅克师傅。","Har. Master Jacques."
"瓦莱尔（对雅克师傅）你说是我偷的？","Val. (to Master Jacques). You say that?"
"雅克师傅我可什么都没说。","Jac. You see that I am not saying anything."
"阿巴贡他说了的。这位警官已经记下了他的证词。","Har. He certainly did. There is the officer who has received his deposition."
"瓦莱尔难道您真的认为我会做出如此下流的事情？","Val. Can you really believe me capable of such a base action?"
"阿巴贡不管你会不会，我都要拿回我的钱。","Har. Capable or not capable, I must find my money."
"第六场——阿巴贡，安塞尔姆，埃莉斯，玛丽安娜，克莱昂特，瓦莱尔，弗罗辛娜，警官，雅克师傅，拉·弗莱什。","SCENE VI.——HARPAGON, ANSELME, ÉLISE, MARIANNE, CLÉANTE, VALÈRE, FROSINE, THE POLICE OFFICER, MASTER JACQUES, LA FLÈCHE."
"克莱昂特父亲，别再为您丢的钱难过了，也别怪罪任何人了。我知道这些钱的下落，我来这儿就是想告诉您，如果您同意我与玛丽安娜结婚，我就把您的钱还给您。","Cle. Do not grieve for your money, father, and accuse any one. I have news of it, and I come here to tell you that if you consent to let me marry Marianne, your money will be given back to you."
"阿巴贡那钱在哪儿？","Har. Where is it?"
"克莱昂特这个您不用担心，我保证它在一个安全的地方，一切都取决于您的决定。您必须做出选择，看您是选择失去玛丽安娜，还是失去您的钱匣子。","Cle. Do not trouble yourself about that. It is in a safe place, and I answer for it; everything depends on your resolve. It is for you to decide, and you have the choice either of losing Marianne or your cash-box."
"阿巴贡没人动过里边的钱？","Har. Has nothing been taken out?"
"克莱昂特没有。就看您是不是同意我与玛丽安娜的婚事。她母亲已经同意玛丽安娜按照自己的意愿做选择，您同意她母亲的做法吗？","Cle. Nothing at all. Is it your intention to agree to this marriage, and to join your consent to that of her mother, who leaves her at liberty to do as she likes?"
"玛丽安娜（对克莱昂特）可是你还不知道，只有我母亲的同意还不够，上天又安排我和我的哥哥重聚了（指着瓦莱尔）。与此同时，我还找回了我的父亲（指着安塞尔姆），你还要得到他的同意。","Mar. (to Cléante). But you do not know that this consent is no longer sufficient, and that heaven has given me back a brother (showing Valère), at the same time that it has given me back a father (showing Anselme); and you have now to obtain me from him."
"安塞尔姆我亲爱的孩子们，上天把你们送回我身边可不是让我违背你们心愿的。阿巴贡先生，您一定也知道，一个年轻女孩的选择更可能是您的儿子，而不是您这个做父亲的。来，多余的话也不说了，像我一样，同意吧，允许他们结婚吧。","Ans. Heaven, my dear children, has not restored you to me that I might oppose your wishes. Mr. Harpagon, you must be aware that the choice of a young girl is more likely to fall upon the son than upon the father. Come, now, do not force people to say to you what is unnecessary, and consent, as I do, to this double marriage."
"阿巴贡为了做出正确的决定，我必须看到我的钱匣子。","Har. In order for me to be well advised, I must see my casket."
"克莱昂特您会看到一个完好无缺的匣子。","Cle. You shall see it safe and sound."
"阿巴贡我可没钱给我的孩子们结婚。","Har. I have no money to give my children in marriage."
"安塞尔姆没关系，我有些钱，这事您不用操心。","Ans. Never mind, I have some; do not let this trouble you."
"阿巴贡您的意思是这两场婚礼的钱都您来付？","Har. Do you take upon yourself to defray the expenses of these two weddings?"
"安塞尔姆是的，我会全额负担的。您满意了吗？","Ans. Yes, I will take this responsibility upon myself. Are you satisfied?"
"阿巴贡是的，只要您答应给我定制一套参加婚礼穿的新礼服。","Har. Yes, provided you order me a new suit of clothes for the wedding."
"安塞尔姆没问题！让我们去庆祝这带给我们美满祝福的一天吧。","Ans. Agreed!Let us go and enjoy the blessings this happy day brings us."
"警官停，先生们，先停下，请稍安勿躁。谁来支付我刚才诉讼记录的费用？","Off. Stop, Sirs, stop; softly, if you please. Who is to pay me for my writing?"
"阿巴贡我们不需要你的那些记录了。","Har. We have nothing to do with your writing."
"警官那倒是！可我也不想自己白白记录了半天。","Off. Indeed! and yet I do not pretend to have done it for nothing."
"阿巴贡（指着雅克师傅）那就把这个人绞死作为酬劳吧。","Har. (showing Master Jacques). There is a fellow you can hang in payment!"
"雅克师傅唉！我可怎么办？我因为之前说实话挨了一顿揍，现在又因为说假话要被绞死了。","Jac. Alas! what is one to do?I receive a good cudgelling for telling the truth, and now they would hang me for lying."
"安塞尔姆阿巴贡先生，您就原谅他这次说谎吧。","Ans. Mr. Harpagon, you must forgive him this piece of imposture."
"阿巴贡那您来支付这位警官的劳务费？","Har. You will pay the officer then?"
"安塞尔姆好吧。我们快离开这儿，我的孩子们，去把这些好消息告诉你们的母亲吧！","Ans. Let it be so.Let us go quickly, my children, to share our joy with your mother!"
"阿巴贡那我要去看看我亲爱的钱匣子啦。","Har. And I to see my dear casket"
