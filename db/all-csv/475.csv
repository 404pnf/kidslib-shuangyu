"“喂，梅布尔，你自己有什么打算？”乔问道，一副愚蠢无礼的口气。他感觉自己相当有把握。他没有听到回答，便把头转向一边，将嘴里的烟丝碎屑运到舌尖，然后吐出来。他对任何事情都漠不关心，因为他感觉自己对什么事情都有把握。","‘Well, Mabel, and what are you going to do with yourself?’ asked Joe, with foolish flippancy.He felt quite safe himself.Without listening for an answer, he turned aside, worked a grain of tobacco to the tip of his tongue, and spat it out.He did not care about anything, since he felt safe himself."
"三兄弟和他们的妹妹围坐在沉闷的早餐桌边，试图随意地商讨点什么。早上送来的邮件已经给这个家庭的命运以最后一击，一切都结束了。这个令人压抑的餐厅本身，连同它那沉重的红木家具，似乎都在等着被处理掉。","The three brothers and the sister sat round the desolate breakfast table, attempting some sort of desultory consultation.The morning’s post had given the final tap to the family fortunes, and all was over.The dreary dining-room itself, with its heavy mahogany furniture, looked as if it were waiting to be done away with."
"但是这次商讨没有取得任何结果。当这三个男人四肢摊开坐在桌旁，抽着烟并茫然地思考着他们各自的境况时，他们都表现出一种无能为力的奇怪神情。那个姑娘单独坐在一边。她二十七岁，是个个头相当矮小、面容阴沉的年轻女子。她和她的兄弟们过着不同的生活。如果没有脸上那一成不变的冷漠，她本来应当是个漂亮的姑娘。她的兄弟们管她那种表情叫“斗牛犬”。","But the consultation amounted to nothing.There was a strange air of ineffectuality about the three men, as they sprawled at table, smoking and reflecting vaguely on their own condition.The girl was alone, a rather short, sullen-looking young woman of twenty-seven.She did not share the same life as her brothers.She would have been good-looking, save for the impassive fixity of her face, ‘bull-dog’, as her brothers called it."
"外面响起了一阵混乱的马蹄声。三个男人都四肢摊开地坐在椅子里注视着。越过草坪带和大道之间的深绿色冬青树林，他们可以看见一队夏尔马正大摇大摆地走出它们各自的圈栏，被带去受训了。这是最后一次了。这些是他们经手的最后一批马了。这些年轻男人们带着挑剔的、冷漠的神情望着。对于突如其来的生活的坍塌，他们都很恐惧。被卷入灾难之中的感觉没有给他们的内心留下丝毫的自由感。","There was a confused tramping of horses’ feet outside.The three men all sprawled round in their chairs to watch.Beyond the dark holly-bushes that separated the strip of lawn from the highroad, they could see a cavalcade of shire horses swinging out of their own yard, being taken for exercise.This was the last time.These were the last horses that would go through their hands.The young men watched with critical, callous look.They were all frightened at the collapse of their lives, and the sense of disaster in which they were involved left them no inner freedom."
"然而，他们是三个十分漂亮、结实的小伙子。乔最年长，是个三十三岁的汉子，身材魁梧、面色红润、性感十足、英俊潇洒。他满脸通红，正用粗手指捻着自己黑黑的胡子，眼神浮躁而不安分。他笑的时候，露出满口牙齿，有一种色眯眯的感觉；他的举止愚笨。现在，他看着那些马，眼中流露出一种无助的呆滞神情，一种没落了的恍惚神情。","Yet they were three fine, well-set fellows enough.Joe, the eldest, was a man of thirty-three, broad and handsome in a hot, flushed way.His face was red, he twisted his black moustache over a thick finger, his eyes were shallow and restless.He had a sensual way of uncovering his teeth when he laughed, and his bearing was stupid.Now he watched the horses with a glazed look of helplessness in his eyes, a certain stupor of downfall."
"这些高大的挽马大摇大摆地走过去了。其中有四匹马头尾上套，它们喷着鼻息，沿着大道走到一条小岔路处，蔑视地用它们巨大的蹄子在细细的黑泥中践踏，炫耀地摇晃着它们硕大滚圆的屁股。当它们在拐角处被带进小路时，突然小跑了几步。它们的一举一动都表现出一种巨大的、昏睡的蛮力和令它们甘于被奴役的愚蠢。前面的马夫一边转过头来，一边猛扯缰绳。马群梦游似的在树篱后晃来晃去，最后一匹马的尾巴突然坚挺地出现在众多扭动着的滚圆的马屁股中。马队就这样走上小路，看不见了。","The great draught-horses swung past.They were tied head to tail, four of them, and they heaved along to where a lane branched off from the highroad, planting their great hoofs floutingly in the fine black mud, swinging their great rounded haunches sumptuously, and trotting a few sudden steps as they were led into the lane, round the corner.Every movement showed a massive, slumbrous strength, and a stupidity which held them in subjection.The groom at the head looked back, jerking the leading rope.And the cavalcade moved out of sight up the lane, the tail of the last horse, bobbed up tight and stiff, held out taut from the swinging great haunches as they rocked behind the hedges in a motion like sleep."
"乔用绝望呆滞的眼神望着。这些马对他而言几乎就像他自己的身体一样。他觉得自己现在完蛋了。幸好他和一位与他年纪相当的女人订了婚。因此她的父亲，附近一处庄园的管家，将给他提供一份工作。他将结婚，将会开始工作。他的人生结束了，从现在起，他将是一只受支配的动物。","Joe watched with glazed hopeless eyes.The horses were almost like his own body to him.He felt he was done for now.Luckily he was engaged to a woman as old as himself, and therefore her father, who was steward of a neighbouring estate, would provide him with a job.He would marry and go into harness.His life was over, he would be a subject animal now."
"他心神不宁地转过脸去，马群远去的蹄声仍在耳中回响。带着愚蠢的躁动，他伸手从盘子里抓了些碎的熏肉皮，轻轻地吹了声口哨，把肉皮扔给了躺在火炉围栏边的猎犬。他看着狗吞下这些碎肉皮，并一直等到这动物也望向他的眼睛为止。然后，他咧开嘴微微一笑，傻乎乎地高声说：","He turned uneasily aside, the retreating steps of the horses echoing in his ears.Then, with foolish restlessness, he reached for the scraps of bacon-rind from the plates, and making a faint whistling sound, flung them to the terrier that lay against the fender.He watched the dog swallow them, and waited till the creature looked into his eyes.Then a faint grin came on his face, and in a high, foolish voice he said:"
"“你再也得不到更多的熏肉了，是吧，你这个小畜——？”","‘You won’t get much more bacon, shall you, you little b—?’"
"狗忧郁地微微摇了摇尾巴，然后蹲了下去，又转了转圈，接着又躺下了。","The dog faintly and dismally wagged its tail, then lowered his haunches, circled round, and lay down again."
"桌子旁又是一阵无可奈何的沉默。乔摊开手脚不自在地坐在自己的位子上，家庭会议不结束就不想走。第二个兄弟弗雷德·亨利，身材挺拔、四肢匀称、机敏灵活。他刚才注视那些马经过的眼神更为镇静沉着。如果说他也像乔一样是只动物的话，那么他会是一只处于支配地位的动物，而不是被支配的动物。他能驾驭任何马匹，因此脸上带着一种对驾驭从容镇定的神情。但是，他却没法驾驭生活中的各种局面。他将粗糙的棕色小胡子往上推了推，露出嘴唇，烦躁地扫了他妹妹一眼。她还是坐着，冷漠而让人无法理解。","There was another helpless silence at the table.Joe sprawled uneasily in his seat, not willing to go till the family conclave was dissolved.Fred Henry, the second brother, was erect, clean-limbed, alert.He had watched the passing of the horses with more sang-froid.If he was an animal, like Joe, he was an animal which controls, not one which is controlled.He was master of any horse, and he carried himself with a well-tempered air of mastery.But he was not master of the situations of life.He pushed his coarse brown moustache upwards, off his lip, and glanced irritably at his sister, who sat impassive and inscrutable."
"“你要去和露西住几天，是吗？”他问。姑娘没有回答。","‘You’ll go and stop with Lucy for a bit, shan’t you?’ he asked.The girl did not answer."
"“我看不出你还能干点什么别的。”弗雷德·亨利继续说道。","‘I don’t see what else you can do,’ persisted Fred Henry."
"“去当女佣。”乔干脆地插嘴道。","‘Go as a skivvy,’ Joe interpolated laconically."
"姑娘纹丝不动。","The girl did not move a muscle."
"“如果我是她，我就去参加培训，当一名护士。”他们当中年龄最小的马尔科姆说。他在家里年龄最小，是个二十二岁的青年，有一张年轻快活的脸。","‘If I was her, I should go in for training for a nurse,’ said Malcolm, the youngest of them all.He was the baby of the family, a young man of twenty-two, with a fresh, jaunty museau."
"但是梅布尔完全没理会他。这么多年来，他们一直不停地唠叨她，拐弯抹角地说她，以至于她几乎没听他们说话。","But Mabel did not take any notice of him.They had talked at her and round her for so many years, that she hardly heard them at all."
"壁炉台上的大理石钟轻轻敲响半点的钟声，狗不安地从壁炉前的地毯上站起来，看着早餐桌旁的这伙人。但是他们仍然坐着，开着徒劳无益的会议。","The marble clock on the mantel-piece softly chimed the half-hour, the dog rose uneasily from the hearthrug and looked at the party at the breakfast table.But still they sat on in ineffectual conclave."
"“噢，好啦，”乔突然说道，什么建议都没提，“我要动身走了。”","‘Oh, all right,’ said Joe suddenly, a propose of nothing.‘I’ll get a move on.’"
"他将椅子向后一推，像骑马似的叉开双腿，突然往下一蹲，好让自己双腿行动自如，然后走向壁炉。他仍然没有走出房间，他非常想知道其他人会做什么或说什么。他开始向烟斗中装烟丝，俯视着狗，不自然地高声说道：","He pushed back his chair, straddled his knees with a downward jerk, to get them free, in horsy fashion, and went to the fire.Still he did not go out of the room; he was curious to know what the others would do or say.He began to charge his pipe, looking down at the dog and saying, in a high, affected voice:"
"“跟我一块儿走吗？跟我一块儿走，怎么样？那样你得到的会比你刚才期望的还要多，听见没？”","‘Going wi’ me?Going wi’ me are ter?Tha’rt goin’ further than tha counts on just now, dost hear?’"
"狗微微地摆了摆尾巴。这个男人翘起下巴，双手握着烟斗心无旁骛地抽着烟，让自己沉迷在烟草中。他一直用自己棕色的眼睛心不在焉地俯视着狗。狗带着伤心和不信任的神情抬头看他。乔双膝向外突出，像是真的在骑马似的站着。","The dog faintly wagged its tail, the man stuck out his jaw and covered his pipe with his hands, and puffed intently, losing himself in the tobacco, looking down all the while at the dog with an absent brown eye.The dog looked up at him in mournful distrust.Joe stood with his knees stuck out, in real horsy fashion."
"“你收到露西的信了吗？” 弗雷德·亨利问他妹妹。","‘Have you had a letter from Lucy?’ Fred Henry asked of his sister."
"“上星期。”回答很含糊。","‘Last week,’ came the neutral reply."
"“那她说什么？”","‘And what does she say?’"
"没有应答。","There was no answer."
"“她要你去，并且呆在那儿吗？”弗雷德·亨利继续追问。","‘Does she ask you to go and stop there?’ persisted Fred Henry."
"“她说如果我愿意，可以住那儿。” ","‘She says I can if I like.’"
"”呃，那么，你还是去比较好。跟她说你周一去。”","‘Well, then, you’d better.Tell her you’ll come on Monday.’"
"这句话得到的回应是沉默。","This was received in silence."
"“那么这就是你打算要做的，是吧？”弗雷德·亨利有点恼怒地说。","‘That’s what you’ll do then, is it?’ said Fred Henry, in some exasperation."
"但是她没有回答。房间里一片沉默，弥漫着无聊和愤怒。马尔科姆咧着嘴憨笑。","But she made no answer.There was a silence of futility and irritation in the room.Malcolm grinned fatuously."
"“从现在开始到下周三之前，你必须打定主意，”乔大声地说，“否则你就要露宿街头了。”","‘You’ll have to make up your mind between now and next Wednesday,’ said Joe loudly, ‘or else find yourself lodgings on the kerbstone.’"
"年轻姑娘的脸阴沉下来，但是她仍然一动不动地坐着。","The face of the young woman darkened, but she sat on immutable."
"“杰克·弗格森来了！”马尔科姆大叫道，他正漫无目的地朝窗外看。","‘Here’s Jack Fergusson!’ exclaimed Malcolm, who was looking aimlessly out of the window."
"“在哪里？”乔大声叫道。","‘Where?’ exclaimed Joe, loudly."
"“刚刚走过去。”","‘Just gone past.’"
"“就要进来了吗？”","‘Coming in?’"
"马尔科姆伸长脖子去看大门。","Malcolm craned his neck to see the gate."
"“是的。”他说道。","‘Yes,’ he said."
"又是一阵沉默。梅布尔像被判了刑似的，继续坐在桌子的上首。这时厨房传来了口哨声。狗站起来猛烈地吠叫。乔打开门叫道：","There was a silence.Mabel sat on like one condemned, at the head of the table.Then a whistle was heard from the kitchen.The dog got up and barked sharply.Joe opened the door and shouted:"
"“快进来。”","‘Come on.’"
"过了一会儿，一个年轻人进来了。他被一件大衣、一条紫色羊毛围巾和一顶花呢帽子裹得紧紧的。进屋后，他没有脱掉帽子，仍然扣在头上。他中等身高，脸相当长，脸色苍白，眼神看上去很疲惫。","After a moment a young man entered.He was muffled up in overcoat and a purple woollen scarf, and his tweed cap, which he did not remove, was pulled down on his head.He was of medium height, his face was rather long and pale, his eyes looked tired."
"“你好，杰克！咳，杰克！”马尔科姆和乔大声说。弗雷德·亨利仅仅说了声“杰克”。","‘Hello, Jack!Well, Jack!’ exclaimed Malcolm and Joe.Fred Henry merely said, ‘Jack.’"
"“还好吗？”新来的人问，明显是在和弗雷德·亨利讲话。","‘What’s doing?’ asked the newcomer, evidently addressing Fred Henry."
"“老样子。我们周三之前必须搬出去。感冒了吗？”","‘Same.We’ve got to be out by Wednesday.—Got a cold?’"
"“是啊——还严重了。”","‘I have—got it bad, too.’"
"“为什么不呆在家里呢？”","‘Why don’t you stop in?’"
"“我呆在家里？等我无法自立的时候，也许我会有这种机会。”这个年轻人嗓音嘶哑地说。他稍微有点苏格兰口音。","‘Me stop in?When I can’t stand on my legs, perhaps I shall have a chance.’ The young man spoke huskily.He had a slight Scotch accent."
"“这可是致命打击，是吧？”乔闹哄哄地说，“如果一位医生患了感冒，嘶哑着嗓子到处走动的话。这看起来对病人不好，不是吗？”","‘It’s a knock-out, isn’t it,’ said Joe, boisterously, ‘if a doctor goes round croaking with a cold.Looks bad for the patients, doesn’t it?’"
"年轻医生缓缓地望向他。","The young doctor looked at him slowly."
"“那么，你有什么病吗？”他讽刺地问道。","‘Anything the matter with you, then?’ he asked sarcastically."
"“据我所知，没有。你这该死的眼睛，我希望没有。为什么？”","‘Not as I know of.Damn your eyes, I hope not.Why?’"
"“我觉得你很关心病人，就怀疑你本人也许是一个病人。”","‘I thought you were very concerned about the patients, wondered if you might be one yourself.’"
"“见鬼，不，我从来就不容忍讨厌的医生，而且希望永远不会。”乔回应道。","‘Damn it, no, I’ve never been patient to no flaming doctor, and hope I never shall be,’ returned Joe."
"就在这时，梅布尔从桌子边站起来，于是他们才似乎开始觉察到她的存在。她开始把盘子收拾到一起。年轻的医生瞅着她，但没有跟她讲话。他之前也没有和她打招呼。她端着托盘走出房间，表情冷漠、没有变化。","At this point Mabel rose from the table, and they all seemed to become aware of her existence.She began putting the dishes together.The young doctor looked at her, but did not address her.He had not greeted her.She went out of the room with the tray, her face impassive and unchanged."
"“那么你们什么时候走，你们所有的人？”医生问道。","‘When are you off then, all of you?’ asked the doctor."
"“我要赶十一点四十分的车。”马尔科姆回答说。“你打算坐双轮马车吗，乔？”","‘I’m catching the eleven-forty,’ replied Malcolm.‘Are you goin’ down wi’ th’ trap, Joe?’"
"“是的，我跟你讲过我要坐双轮马车，不是吗？”","‘Yes, I’ve told you I’m going down wi’ th’ trap, haven’t I?’"
"“那么我们最好赶得上那车。——再会，杰克，如果我走之前没再见到你。”马尔科姆边说边和他握手。","‘We’d better be getting her in then.—So long, Jack, if I don’t see you before I go,’ said Malcolm, shaking hands."
"他走了出去，乔像夹着尾巴似的跟在他后面。","He went out, followed by Joe, who seemed to have his tail between his legs."
"“哎，真是麻烦事啊。”医生大声说，这时他和弗雷德·亨利单独留了下来。“你要在周三之前离开，是吗？”","‘Well, this is the devil’s own,’ exclaimed the doctor, when he was left alone with Fred Henry.‘Going before Wednesday, are you?’"
"“那是命令。”对方回答说。","‘That’s the orders,’ replied the other."
"“上哪儿？北安普敦？”","‘Where, to Northampton?’"
"“对，就是那儿。“","‘That’s it.’"
"“见鬼！”弗格森大声嚷道，心怀懊恼。","‘The devil!’ exclaimed Fergusson, with quiet chagrin."
"随后，两人一阵沉默。","And there was silence between the two."
"“都办妥了，是吗？”弗格森问道。","‘All settled up, are you?’ asked Fergusson."
"“差不多吧。”","‘About.’"
"又是一阵沉默。","There was another pause."
"“我会想你的，弗雷迪，老兄。”年轻的医生说。","‘Well, I shall miss yer, Freddy, boy,’ said the young doctor."
"“我也会想你的，杰克。”对方回答说。","‘And I shall miss thee, Jack,’ returned the other."
"“我会非常想你的。”医生若有所思地说道。","‘Miss you like hell,’ mused the doctor."
"弗雷德转过脸去。没有什么可说了。梅布尔又进来了，把桌子清理完。","Fred Henry turned aside.There was nothing to say.Mabel came in again, to finish clearing the table."
"“那你打算怎么办，柏文小姐？”弗格森问道，“去你姐姐家，是吧？”","‘What are you going to do, then, Miss Pervin?’ asked Fergusson.‘Going to your sister’s, are you?’"
"梅布尔用危险的眼神定定地盯着他，这眼神总使他不安，搅乱了他表面的轻松。","Mabel looked at him with her steady, dangerous eyes, that always made him uncomfortable, unsettling his superficial ease."
"“不。”她说道。","‘No,’ she said."
"“噢，天哪，你打算干什么？说说你想干什么？”弗雷德·亨利徒劳地大声叫道。","‘Well, what in the name of fortune are you going to do?Say what you mean to do,’ cried Fred Henry, with futile intensity."
"但是她只是转过头去，继续干她的活。她叠起白色的桌布，然后铺上雪尼尔绒布。","But she only averted her head, and continued her work.She folded the white table-cloth, and put on the chenille cloth."
"“怎么也踹不出个屁来，这个最阴阳怪气的婊子！”他哥哥咕哝道。","‘The sulkiest bitch that ever trod!’ muttered her brother."
"但她表情极其冷漠地干完活；年轻的医生一直饶有兴致地看着她。然后她走了出去。","But she finished her task with perfectly impassive face, the young doctor watching her interestedly all the while.Then she went out."
"弗雷德·亨利瞪着她，紧闭双唇，蓝色的眼睛带着强烈的敌意，一副刻薄愤怒的痛苦表情。","Fred Henry stared after her, clenching his lips, his blue eyes fixing in sharp antagonism, as he made a grimace of sour exasperation."
"“你把她碾得粉碎，从她那儿也就得到这些。”他低声细气地说。","‘You could bray her into bits, and that’s all you’d get out of her,’ he said, in a small, narrowed tone."
"医生微微一笑。","The doctor smiled faintly."
"“那么她打算怎么办？”他问。","‘What’s she going to do, then?’ he asked."
"“我要是知道，你揍我都行！”对方答道。","‘Strike me if I know!’ returned the other."
"两人停了一会儿。接着医生有些激动。","There was a pause.Then the doctor stirred."
"“今晚我要见你，行吗？”他对他的朋友说。","‘I’ll be seeing you tonight, shall I?’ he said to his friend."
"“好的——去哪儿？”“我们要去爵斯代尔吗？”","‘Ay—where’s it to be?Are we going over to Jessdale?’"
"“我不知道。我都感冒成这样了。反正我会去‘星月’的。”","‘I don’t know.I’ve got such a cold on me.I’ll come round to the Moon and Stars, anyway.’"
"“就让利齐和梅错过一晚，呃？”","‘Let Lizzie and May miss their night for once, eh?’"
"“就这样——如果到时我还这么想的话。“","‘That’s it—if I feel as I do now.’"
"“全都一样——”","‘All’s one—’"
"两个年轻人一起穿过走廊，来到后门。这座房子很大，但是现在没有仆人了，因此非常荒凉。在房子的后面是一个砖砌的小院子，院子外是一个大广场，铺着精细的红色石头，广场的两侧有些马厩。冬天昏暗阴湿的田野倾斜着往空旷的远处延伸。","The two young men went through the passage and down to the back door together.The house was large, but it was servantless now, and desolate.At the back was a small bricked house-yard, and beyond that a big square, gravelled fine and red, and having stables on two sides.Sloping, dank, winter-dark fields stretched away on the open sides."
"但马厩里空空如也。约瑟夫·柏文，这家的父亲，是个没有受过教育的人，过去是个实力相当雄厚的马贩子。马厩里曾挤满了马匹。马匹、贩子和马夫们来来往往，场面宏大而喧嚣。当时厨房里挤满了佣人。但是近来，生意衰败了。为了重获好运，老人家曾经再婚。现在他死了，一切都成了过眼云烟，只剩下债务与恫吓。","But the stables were empty.Joseph Pervin, the father of the family, had been a man of no education, who had become a fairly large horse dealer.The stables had been full of horses, there was a great turmoil and come-and-go of horses and of dealers and grooms.Then the kitchen was full of servants.But of late things had declined.The old man had married a second time, to retrieve his fortunes.Now he was dead and everything was gone to the dogs, there was nothing but debt and threatening."
"几个月来，梅布尔呆在这座没有佣人的大房子里，在贫困中为她那些碌碌无为的兄弟们维持着这个家。她当家已经有十年了。但以前花钱是没有限制的。那时，虽然一切都粗俗野蛮，但是有钱的感觉让她骄傲、自信。男人们也许满嘴脏话，厨房里的女人们可能名声不好，她的兄弟们也许私生子。但是只要有钱，姑娘就感觉自己地位稳固，冷酷骄傲，沉默寡言。","For months, Mabel had been servantless in the big house, keeping the home together in penury for her ineffectual brothers.She had kept house for ten years.But previously, it was with unstinted means.Then, however brutal and coarse everything was, the sense of money had kept her proud, confident.The men might be foul-mouthed, the women in the kitchen might have bad reputations, her brothers might have illegitimate children.But so long as there was money, the girl felt herself established, and brutally proud, reserved."
"这个家，除了一些马贩子和粗俗的男人，没有什么客人来访。自从姐姐嫁走以后，梅布尔就没有同性友伴了。但是她不在意。她定期去教堂，还负责照顾父亲。她生活在对她母亲的回忆里。母亲在她十四岁时就死了，她很爱母亲。她也曾以一种不同的方式爱着她的父亲。她曾依赖他，在他那里感到安全，直到他五十四岁再婚为止。当时，她强烈反对他再婚。现在他已经死了，撇下他们绝望地生活在债务中。","No company came to the house, save dealers and coarse men.Mabel had no associates of her own sex, after her sister went away.But she did not mind.She went regularly to church, she attended to her father.And she lived in the memory of her mother, who had died when she was fourteen, and whom she had loved.She had loved her father, too, in a different way, depending upon him, and feeling secure in him, until at the age of fifty-four he married again.And then she had set hard against him.Now he had died and left them all hopelessly in debt."
"在这段贫苦的日子里，她受了不少罪。但是，古怪、阴沉、动物般的骄傲主宰着这个家庭的每一个成员，没有什么可以撼动。现在，对梅布尔来讲，结局已经来了。她仍然不愿意为自己想方设法，寻找出路。她宁愿按自己的方式一成不变地生活。她总是想掌控自己的处境。她日复一日地、愚蠢固执地苦熬着。为什么她应当思考？为什么她应当回答别人？行了，这就是尽头，没有出路了。她再也不必避人耳目，悄悄地穿过小镇的主街了。她再也不需要自贬身份，到商店买最廉价的食物了。这就是尽头了。她不考虑任何人，甚至连自己都不考虑。她仿佛处在一种心醉神迷的状态中，愚蠢而固执。她觉得自己越来越接近自我实现，接近自身的荣耀，接近去世了的荣耀的母亲。","She had suffered badly during the period of poverty.Nothing, however, could shake the curious sullen, animal pride that dominated each member of the family.Now, for Mabel, the end had come.Still she would not cast about her.She would follow her own way just the same.She would always hold the keys of her own situation.Mindless and persistent, she endured from day to day.Why should she think?Why should she answer anybody?It was enough that this was the end, and there was no way out.She need not pass any more darkly along the main street of the small town, avoiding every eye.She need not demean herself any more, going into the shops and buying the cheapest food.This was at an end.She thought of nobody, not even of herself.Mindless and persistent, she seemed in a sort of ecstasy to be coming nearer to her fulfilment, her own glorification, approaching her dead mother, who was glorified."
"下午，她拿了一个小包出去了，包里有大剪刀、海绵以及一把小洗衣刷。这是一个阴沉、寒冷的日子，深绿色的田野相当惨淡，空气被不远处铸造厂排出的烟弄得黑黢黢的。她悄悄地沿着人行道匆匆穿过镇子，往墓地而去，不理会任何人。","In the afternoon she took a little bag, with shears and sponge and a small scrubbing brush, and went out.It was a grey, wintry day, with saddened, dark-green fields and an atmosphere blackened by the smoke of foundries not far off.She went quickly, darkly along the causeway, heeding nobody, through the town to the churchyard."
"在那里她总是感觉很安全，仿佛没人能看见她。但实际上，她却暴露在从墓地墙下经过的所有人的目光之下。虽然如此，一旦身处教堂那隐隐约约的巨大阴影下，身处墓地之中，她就觉得自己不再受尘世的影响，留在教堂墓地厚厚的围墙之中，如同身处异国他乡。","There she always felt secure, as if no one could see her, although as a matter of fact she was exposed to the stare of everyone who passed along under the churchyard wall.Nevertheless, once under the shadow of the great looming church, among the graves, she felt immune from the world, reserved within the thick churchyard wall as in another country."
"她仔细地修剪坟墓上的草，然后将粉白色的小菊花摆放在锡制的十字架中。当这些都做完后，她从临近的一个坟墓处拿了一个空罐子，取来水，接着用海绵认真仔细、小心翼翼地擦洗大理石墓碑和压顶石。","Carefully she clipped the grass from the grave, and arranged the pinky-white, small chrysanthemums in the tin cross.When this was done, she took an empty jar from a neighbouring grave, brought water, and carefully, most scrupulously sponged the marble headstone and the coping-stone."
"做这些给她一种真切的满足感。她感觉直接接触到了她母亲的世界。她几乎感觉不到辛苦，以一种近乎完美的幸福状态穿过墓园。仿佛在执行这一任务时，她进入了一种与母亲的微妙、亲密的联系中。因为她在这个世界上所追随的生命远不及她从母亲那里继承来的死亡世界真实。","It gave her sincere satisfaction to do this.She felt in immediate contact with the world of her mother.She took minute pains, went through the park in a state bordering on pure happiness, as if in performing this task she came into a subtle, intimate connexion with her mother.For the life she followed here in the world was far less real than the world of death she inherited from her mother."
"医生的房子就在教堂旁边。弗格森仅仅是一名受雇的助理，拼命在乡下出诊。现在他正匆匆赶去诊疗室给门诊病人看病。他用敏锐的目光瞥过墓地，看见这个姑娘正在墓地扫墓。她看起来如此专注，又如此遥远，仿佛是在观察另一个世界。他内心被某种神秘的元素打动了。走着走着，他慢下了脚步，仿佛着了魔似的看着她。","The doctor’s house was just by the church.Fergusson, being a mere hired assistant, was slave to the countryside.As he hurried now to attend to the outpatients in the surgery, glancing across the graveyard with his quick eye, he saw the girl at her task at the grave.She seemed so intent and remote, it was like looking into another world.Some mystical element was touched in him.He slowed down as he walked, watching her as if spell-bound."
"她抬起眼睛，觉察到他在看她。他们的目光相遇了。接着他们又对视了一下，彼此都感觉到在某些方面被对方洞察到了。他举了举帽子，然后沿着路走了过去。在他的意识中，像幻觉一样，清晰地记得她的脸从教堂墓地的墓碑旁抬起，用她迟钝的、大大的、令人畏惧的眼神看着他。她的脸令人畏惧。它仿佛对他施了催眠术。她的眼神里有一股巨大的力量牢牢地抓住了他的整个身心，让他仿佛喝了某种强力药似的。过去他一直感到虚弱和精疲力竭。现在他又焕发了生机，感觉自己从焦躁、日复一日的自我中解脱出来了。","She lifted her eyes, feeling him looking.Their eyes met.And each looked again at once, each feeling, in some way, found out by the other.He lifted his cap and passed on down the road.There remained distinct in his consciousness, like a vision, the memory of her face, lifted from the tombstone in the churchyard, and looking at him with slow, large, portentous eyes.It was portentous, her face.It seemed to mesmerize him.There was a heavy power in her eyes which laid hold of his whole being, as if he had drunk some powerful drug.He had been feeling weak and done before.Now the life came back into him, he felt delivered from his own fretted, daily self."
"他尽可能快地做完诊所的工作，匆忙地往等候的人们的瓶子里填满便宜的药。随后，在没完没了的匆忙中，他在下午茶之前再次动身去附近另外一处的几个病人那里巡诊。一直以来，除了身体不适的特别情况之外，只要他能，他就更愿意步行。他想着运动能让他恢复精力。","He finished his duties at the surgery as quickly as might be, hastily filling up the bottles of the waiting people with cheap drugs.Then, in perpetual haste, he set off again to visit several cases in another part of his round, before teatime.At all times he preferred to walk, if he could, but particularly when he was not well.He fancied the motion restored him."
"下午即将落下帷幕。天气死一般寒冷灰暗，潮湿、阴沉的严寒慢慢渗入身体，麻木着所有的感官。但是为什么他要考虑或注意这些呢？他匆忙地爬上山，转身穿过深绿色的田野，接着走上黑色的煤渣路。远处，穿过乡间一个浅浅的洼地，小镇像阴燃的灰烬一般坐落在那里。一座堡垒、一座尖塔和一堆熄了灯、光秃秃的低矮房子聚集在一起。在最近的小镇边缘，地势向下倾斜延伸到洼地，那里是“古牧场”，柏文家的住宅。他能够清楚地看到那些马厩和外围建筑，因为它们位于朝向他的斜坡上。咳，他去那儿的次数不会很多了！对他来说，又少了一个娱乐消遣，又少了一个可去之处：他将失去在这个陌生的、丑陋的小镇里唯一关心的友伴。除了工作、苦差事、不断在煤矿工人和钢铁工人中匆匆从这个住所赶到那个住所以外，他什么都没有了。这使他筋疲力尽，但同时，他又渴望这样生活。身处这些劳动者们的家里，这对他而言是一种兴奋剂，可以说是在穿越他们生活的最深处。他的神经既兴奋又满足。他能如此近地深入到这些不善言辞、感情强烈的粗野男女的生活中。他抱怨说他憎恨这个地狱般的洞穴。但事实上，与这些感情强烈的粗野之人接触是直接作用于他神经的一种兴奋剂，使他兴奋不已。","The afternoon was falling.It was grey, deadened, and wintry, with a slow, moist, heavy coldness sinking in and deadening all the faculties.But why should he think or notice?He hastily climbed the hill and turned across the dark-green fields, following the black cinder-track.In the distance, across a shallow dip in the country, the small town was clustered like smouldering ash, a tower, a spire, a heap of low, raw, extinct houses.And on the nearest fringe of the town, sloping into the dip, was Oldmeadow, the Pervins’ house.He could see the stables and the outbuildings distinctly, as they lay towards him on the slope.Well, he would not go there many more times!Another resource would be lost to him, another place gone: the only company he cared for in the alien, ugly little town he was losing.Nothing but work, drudgery, constant hastening from dwelling to dwelling among the colliers and the iron-workers.It wore him out, but at the same time he had a craving for it.It was a stimulant to him to be in the homes of the working people, moving as it were through the innermost body of their life.His nerves were excited and gratified.He could come so near, into the very lives of the rough, inarticulate, powerfully emotional men and women.He grumbled, he said he hated the hellish hole.But as a matter of fact it excited him, the contact with the rough, strongly-feeling people was a stimulant applied direct to his nerves."
"在“古牧场”下面，在浅浅的、湿润的绿色田野洼地中，有一个方形的深池塘。环视着这些景色，医生目光敏锐地发现一个身穿黑衣的人影通过田野的大门，向下朝池塘走去。他又看了看。那应当是梅布尔·柏文。他的思想突然变得活跃专注起来。","Below Oldmeadow, in the green, shallow, soddened hollow of fields, lay a square, deep pond.Roving across the landscape, the doctor’s quick eye detected a figure in black passing through the gate of the field, down towards the pond.He looked again.It would be Mabel Pervin.His mind suddenly became alive and attentive."
"她为什么往那里去？他停在上面斜坡的小路上，站在那里目不转睛地看着。他仅仅能够确定这个黑色的小身影在暮色降临的洼地中移动。在如此昏暗的天色里，他似乎看见了她，像是有千里眼似的。与其说他是用普通的视力看见的，倒不如说他是用心灵之眼看到的。然而当他专注地盯着时，他足够肯定能看见她。他觉得，在这丑陋的、浓浓的暮色降临之时，如果他把目光从她身上移开，就会完全看不见她了。","Why was she going down there?He pulled up on the path on the slope above, and stood staring.He could just make sure of the small black figure moving in the hollow of the failing day.He seemed to see her in the midst of such obscurity, that he was like a clairvoyant, seeing rather with the mind’s eye than with ordinary sight.Yet he could see her positively enough, whilst he kept his eye attentive.He felt, if he looked away from her, in the thick, ugly falling dusk, he would lose her altogether."
"当她移动时，他的目光时刻跟着她，目不转睛，就好像是什么东西被传染了，而不是自发地流行起来一样，他就这样径直沿着田野往池塘走去。她在池塘的岸上站了一会儿。她一直没抬头。然后她缓缓地涉入水中。","He followed her minutely as she moved, direct and intent, like something transmitted rather than stirring in voluntary activity, straight down the field towards the pond.There she stood on the bank for a moment.She never raised her head.Then she waded slowly into the water."
"他一动不动地站着。这个黑色的小身影缓缓地、小心谨慎地朝池塘中心走去，在静止的水中极其缓慢地、逐步地移向水的更深处，并且当水漫到她的胸部时，她仍然朝前移动。然后在死一般的暮色中，他再也看不见她了。","He stood motionless as the small black figure walked slowly and deliberately towards the centre of the pond, very slowly, gradually moving deeper into the motionless water, and still moving forward as the water got up to her breast.Then he could see her no more in the dusk of the dead afternoon."
"“喂！”他喊道，“你会相信吗？”","‘There!’ he exclaimed.‘Would you believe it?’"
"他急忙笔直向下跑过湿漉漉的田野，挤过树篱，进入到这寒冷、阴暗、无情的洼地中。他用了几分钟来到了池塘。他站在岸上，气喘吁吁。他什么都看不见。他的目光仿佛穿透了这池死水。是的，水面下的可能就是她黑色衣服的暗影。","And he hastened straight down, running over the wet, soddened fields, pushing through the hedges, down into the depression of callous wintry obscurity.It took him several minutes to come to the pond.He stood on the bank, breathing heavily.He could see nothing.His eyes seemed to penetrate the dead water.Yes, perhaps that was the dark shadow of her black clothing beneath the surface of the water."
"他冒险慢慢进入池塘。池塘底部是深软的泥土，他陷了进去，冰冷刺骨的水缠绕着他的双腿。当他活动时，他可以闻到向上泛起的水中那冰冷、腐烂的泥土的气味。这种味道令他作呕。尽管反感，但是他并不在意，他朝池塘更深处走进去。冰冷的水淹到了他的大腿处，到了他的腰部，升到了他的腹部。他身体的下半部完全陷入这可怕的冰冷之中。池塘底部是又深又软，变化无常，他害怕会猛然跌倒，嘴巴没入水中。他不会游泳，十分害怕。","He slowly ventured into the pond.The bottom was deep, soft clay, he sank in, and the water clasped dead cold round his legs.As he stirred he could smell the cold, rotten clay that fouled up into the water.It was objectionable in his lungs.Still, repelled and yet not heeding, he moved deeper into the pond.The cold water rose over his thighs, over his loins, upon his abdomen.The lower part of his body was all sunk in the hideous cold element.And the bottom was so deeply soft and uncertain, he was afraid of pitching with his mouth underneath.He could not swim, and was afraid."
"他稍稍下蹲，张开双手在水下四处搜寻，想设法摸到她。冰冷刺骨的塘水摇荡着升到了他的胸口。他又动了一下，更深了一点，再一次用双手在水下到处摸索。然后他触到了她的衣服。但是衣服从他的指间溜走了。他拼命地想抓住它。","He crouched a little, spreading his hands under the water and moving them round, trying to feel for her.The dead cold pond swayed upon his chest.He moved again, a little deeper, and again, with his hands underneath, he felt all around under the water.And he touched her clothing.But it evaded his fingers.He made a desperate effort to grasp it."
"这样一来，他失去了平衡，沉了下去。他在污秽的泥水中感到窒息，疯狂地挣扎了一会儿，十分恐怖。终于，在经过了一段仿佛无穷无尽的时间之后，他站稳了脚，再次冒出水面，然后四处张望。他喘着气，知道自己还活在这个世上。然后他看着池水。她已经在他附近浮了起来。他抓住她的衣服，把她拉得更近一些，转身向岸上走去。","And so doing he lost his balance and went under, horribly, suffocating in the foul earthy water, struggling madly for a few moments.At last, after what seemed an eternity, he got his footing, rose again into the air and looked around.He gasped, and knew he was in the world.Then he looked at the water.She had risen near him.He grasped her clothing, and drawing her nearer, turned to take his way to land again."
"他走得非常迟缓、小心翼翼，全神贯注地缓慢前进。他渐渐浮出水面，爬出了池塘。水现在只及他的腿部了；摆脱了池塘的魔爪，他很感激，心中充满了慰藉。他托起她，蹒跚地走出恐怖的灰色湿泥，来到岸上。","He went very slowly, carefully, absorbed in the slow progress.He rose higher, climbing out of the pond.The water was now only about his legs; he was thankful, full of relief to be out of the clutches of the pond.He lifted her and staggered on to the bank, out of the horror of wet, grey clay."
"他把她平放在岸上。她完全不省人事，浑身是水。他将水从她嘴里弄出来，努力使她恢复知觉。他没有忙活太久就感到她又开始呼吸了；她在自然地呼吸了。他又抢救了一段时间。他能够感到她在他的双手下活了过来；她在渐渐恢复。他擦了擦她的脸，用自己的大衣将她裹住，看了看四周深灰色的昏暗世界，然后托起她，蹒跚地走下岸边，穿过田野。","He laid her down on the bank.She was quite unconscious and running with water.He made the water come from her mouth, he worked to restore her.He did not have to work very long before he could feel the breathing begin again in her; she was breathing naturally.He worked a little longer.He could feel her live beneath his hands; she was coming back.He wiped her face, wrapped her in his overcoat, looked round into the dim, dark-grey world, then lifted her and staggered down the bank and across the fields."
"这仿佛是一段不可思议的漫漫长路，负担如此之重，让他觉得自己永远也到不了那栋房子。但是他终于进了马厩的院子，接着又进了房屋的院子。他打开门，然后走进屋子。他让她躺在厨房里炉前的地毯上，然后叫人。房子里没人。但是壁炉中的火还在燃烧着。","It seemed an unthinkably long way, and his burden so heavy he felt he would never get to the house.But at last he was in the stable-yard, and then in the house-yard.He opened the door and went into the house.In the kitchen he laid her down on the hearthrug, and called.The house was empty.But the fire was burning in the grate."
"然后他再次跪下来护理她。她正在有规律地呼吸着，她的双眼睁得大大的，仿佛有了意识，但她的神情中似乎缺少了什么东西。她有了知觉，但意识不到她周围的事物。","Then again he kneeled to attend to her.She was breathing regularly, her eyes were wide open and as if conscious, but there seemed something missing in her look.She was conscious in herself, but unconscious of her surroundings."
"他跑上楼去，从一张床上拿了几床毯子，将它们放在炉火前烤暖和。然后，他脱掉她透湿的、带有土腥味的衣服，用一条毛巾将她擦干，接着将她赤身裸体地裹在这些毯子里。接着他走进餐厅，去找些烈酒。还有点威士忌。他自己喝了一大口，接着往她的嘴里喂了一些。","He ran upstairs, took blankets from a bed, and put them before the fire to warm.Then he removed her saturated, earthy-smelling clothing, rubbed her dry with a towel, and wrapped her naked in the blankets.Then he went into the dining-room, to look for spirits.There was a little whisky.He drank a gulp himself, and put some into her mouth."
"效果立竿见影。她仔细地打量着他的脸，好像一直看着他，过了一段时间后才意识到他。","The effect was instantaneous.She looked full into his face, as if she had been seeing him for some time, and yet had only just become conscious of him."
"“弗格森医生？”她说道。","‘Dr. Fergusson?’ she said."
"“什么？”他回答说。","‘What?’ he answered."
"他正在脱掉外套，打算上楼去找些干衣服。他受不了那死水泥土的味道，而且他对自己的健康担心得要命。","He was divesting himself of his coat, intending to find some dry clothing upstairs.He could not bear the smell of the dead, clayey water, and he was mortally afraid for his own health."
"“我干什么了？”她问。","‘What did I do?’ she asked."
"“走进了池塘。”他回答说。他之前就开始像病人一样发抖，几乎护理不了她。她的目光完全停留在他身上，他的意识仿佛要变得模糊，他无助地回望向她。他抖得不那么厉害了，重新恢复了生气。虽然它模糊而不易察觉，但他的生命又强大了起来。","‘Walked into the pond,’ he replied.He had begun to shudder like one sick, and could hardly attend to her.Her eyes remained full on him, he seemed to be going dark in his mind, looking back at her helplessly.The shuddering became quieter in him, his life came back in him, dark and unknowing, but strong again."
"“我当时是不是疯了？”她问道，同时眼睛一直盯着他。","‘Was I out of my mind?’ she asked, while her eyes were fixed on him all the time."
"“可能，当时是。”他答道。他感觉平静了，因为他的力气已经恢复了。那种奇怪的焦躁紧张已经离他而去。","‘Maybe, for the moment,’ he replied.He felt quiet, because his strength had come back.The strange fretful strain had left him."
"“我现在是不是疯了？”她问。","‘Am I out of my mind now?’ she asked."
"”你吗？”他思索了片刻。“不，”他诚实地回答，“我觉得你没疯。”他转过脸去。他现在害怕起来，因为他感到茫然，而且他朦胧地感到在这个问题上她的力量比自己的强。她一直目不转睛地看着他。“你能不能告诉我，我在哪里能找到些干衣服穿？”他问道。","‘Are you?’ he reflected a moment.‘No,’ he answered truthfully, ‘I don’t see that you are.’He turned his face aside.He was afraid now, because he felt dazed, and felt dimly that her power was stronger than his, in this issue.And she continued to look at him fixedly all the time.‘Can you tell me where I shall find some dry things to put on?’ he asked."
"“你为了我跳进了池塘？”她问道。","‘Did you dive into the pond for me?’ she asked."
"“不，”他答道，“我是走进去的。但水还是淹没了我的头顶。”","‘No,’ he answered.‘I walked in.But I went in overhead as well.’"
"他们沉默了一会儿。他犹豫着。他非常想上楼穿上干衣服。但是在他体内还有另一种欲望。而且她似乎要拥抱他。他软弱无力地站在她面前，仿佛他的意志已经睡着了，并且离开了他。但是他的内心深处感到温暖。虽然他身上的衣服湿透了，但他丝毫没有颤抖。","There was silence for a moment.He hesitated.He very much wanted to go upstairs to get into dry clothing.But there was another desire in him.And she seemed to hold him.His will seemed to have gone to sleep, and left him, standing there slack before her.But he felt warm inside himself.He did not shudder at all, though his clothes were sodden on him."
"“你为什么救我？”她问道。","‘Why did you?’ she asked."
"“因为我不想让你做如此愚蠢的一件事。”他说。","‘Because I didn’t want you to do such a foolish thing,’ he said."
"“这不愚蠢，”她说着，躺在地板上，一个沙发垫子枕在头下，仍然盯着他，“这是正确的事。那时我最清楚。”","‘It wasn’t foolish,’ she said, still gazing at him as she lay on the floor, with a sofa cushion under her head.‘It was the right thing to do.I knew best, then.’"
"“我去换掉这些湿衣服。”他说。但是他仍然无力从她面前离开，除非她打发他走。她仿佛把他身体的活力掌握在了她的手里，他不能自己摆脱。或者他也许是不想摆脱。","‘I’ll go and shift these wet things,’ he said.But still he had not the power to move out of her presence, until she sent him.It was as if she had the life of his body in her hands, and he could not extricate himself.Or perhaps he did not want to."
"她忽然坐了起来。接着她意识到她自己目前的处境。她感觉到毯子裹着自己，感觉到了自己的四肢。片刻间她仿佛失去了理智。她用疯狂的目光四处查看，好像在寻找什么东西。他恐惧地站着，一动不动。她看见自己的衣服散落在地板上。","Suddenly she sat up.Then she became aware of her own immediate condition.She felt the blankets about her, she knew her own limbs.For a moment it seemed as if her reason were going.She looked round, with wild eye, as if seeking something.He stood still with fear.She saw her clothing lying scattered."
"“谁脱了我的衣服？”她问，目光逼人地牢牢盯住他的脸。","‘Who undressed me?’ she asked, her eyes resting full and inevitable on his face."
"“我脱的，”他回答说，“为了让你苏醒过来。”","‘I did,’ he replied, ‘to bring you round.’"
"有一段时间，她张着嘴坐着，可怕地盯着他。","For some moments she sat and gazed at him awfully, her lips parted."
"“那么你爱我吗？”她问。","‘Do you love me then?’ she asked."
"他只是站着，着迷地凝视着她。他的灵魂仿佛融化了。","He only stood and stared at her, fascinated.His soul seemed to melt."
"她双膝跪着蹒跚向前，双臂抱着他，抱着他的双腿，而他就站在那儿。她将胸部抵压在他的膝盖和大腿上，带着奇怪而骚动的坚定神情搂着他。她抵着他的大腿，把他拽向自己的脸、喉咙，用闪亮而又恭顺的眼神仰视着他。这个眼神变幻无穷，露出第一次占有男人的喜悦之情。","She shuffled forward on her knees, and put her arms round him, round his legs, as he stood there, pressing her breasts against his knees and thighs, clutching him with strange, convulsive certainty, pressing his thighs against her, drawing him to her face, her throat, as she looked up at him with flaring, humble eyes, of transfiguration, triumphant in first possession."
"“你爱我，”她怪异而喜不自胜地咕哝着，这声音充满了渴望、得意与自信。“你爱我。我知道你爱我，我知道。”","‘You love me,’ she murmured, in strange transport, yearning and triumphant and confident.‘You love me.I know you love me, I know.’"
"接着，她热情地亲吻他的双膝，透过湿漉漉的衣服，热情而恣意地亲吻他的双膝、双腿，仿佛忘却了一切。","And she was passionately kissing his knees, through the wet clothing, passionately and indiscriminately kissing his knees, his legs, as if unaware of every thing."
"他低头看着她乱成一团的湿发和她狂野、赤裸、充满肉感的双肩。他惊讶、困惑、害怕。他从未想过爱她。他也从未想要去爱她。当他救她并使她恢复知觉时，他是一位医生，而她是一位病人。他对她没有过一丝私念。不仅如此，如此介入个人因素对他而言是非常讨厌的，是对他职业声誉的玷污。让她在那里抱着他的双膝真是令人讨厌。这令人讨厌。他感到强烈地反感。但是——但是——他无力挣脱。","He looked down at the tangled wet hair, the wild, bare, animal shoulders.He was amazed, bewildered, and afraid.He had never thought of loving her.He had never wanted to love her.When he rescued her and restored her, he was a doctor, and she was a patient.He had had no single personal thought of her.Nay, this introduction of the personal element was very distasteful to him, a violation of his professional honour.It was horrible to have her there embracing his knees.It was horrible.He revolted from it, violently.And yet—and yet—he had not the power to break away."
"她再次看着他，眼里依旧充满了强大的爱的恳求，以及那种超然的、令人恐惧的喜悦的光芒。见到这微妙的热情像一道光芒般从她脸上放射出来，他就无能为力了。但是他从来没有打算过要去爱她。他从来没打算过。而且他内心深处某种执拗的东西让他无法让步。","She looked at him again, with the same supplication of powerful love, and that same transcendent, frightening light of triumph.In view of the delicate flame which seemed to come from her face like a light, he was powerless.And yet he had never intended to love her.He had never intended.And something stubborn in him could not give way."
"“你爱我，”她带着一种深深的、狂热的自信，喃喃重复道，“你爱我。”","‘You love me,’ she repeated, in a murmur of deep, rhapsodic assurance.‘You love me.’"
"她双手拉着他，将他往下拉到身边。他害怕，甚至有点恐惧。因为他确实没有爱她的打算。但是她的双手正在把他拉向她。他迅速抽出手来使自己站稳，抓住了她赤裸的肩膀。一股火焰仿佛在灼烧着他抓住她柔软肩膀的手。他没打算过爱她：他的整个意志反对他屈服。这太可怕了。但是触摸她的肩膀是多么奇妙啊，她脸上的光芒是多么美丽啊。她当时也许是疯了吧？他有一种向她屈从的恐惧。但是他内心深处也有某种东西在疼痛。","Her hands were drawing him, drawing him down to her.He was afraid, even a little horrified.For he had, really, no intention of loving her.Yet her hands were drawing him towards her.He put out his hand quickly to steady himself, and grasped her bare shoulder.A flame seemed to burn the hand that grasped her soft shoulder.He had no intention of loving her: his whole will was against his yielding.It was horrible.And yet wonderful was the touch of her shoulders, beautiful the shining of her face.Was she perhaps mad?He had a horror of yielding to her.Yet something in him ached also."
"他一直凝视着远处的门，没有看她。但是他的那只手还放在她的肩上。她突然变得非常平静了。他低头看她。她的眼睛因为害怕和疑惑而睁得大大的，脸上的光芒正在消失，一道可怕的灰色阴影又要回到她的脸上。他无法忍受接触到她怀疑的目光，以及在怀疑之后死亡一般的神情。","He had been staring away at the door, away from her.But his hand remained on her shoulder.She had gone suddenly very still.He looked down at her.Her eyes were now wide with fear, with doubt, the light was dying from her face, a shadow of terrible greyness was returning.He could not bear the touch of her eyes’ question upon him, and the look of death behind the question."
"他内心呻吟了一声，不再坚持，让自己的心向她屈服。一丝温和的笑容突然出现在他脸上。她的目光一直没有离开他的脸，双眼慢慢地、慢慢地充满了泪水。他看着她眼中这奇怪的水浮现，像泉水似的慢慢涌出。而他的心仿佛在胸中燃烧、熔化了。","With an inward groan he gave way, and let his heart yield towards her.A sudden gentle smile came on his face.And her eyes, which never left his face, slowly, slowly filled with tears.He watched the strange water rise in her eyes, like some slow fountain coming up.And his heart seemed to burn and melt away in his breast."
"他不忍再看她了。他跪下来，用双臂抱住她的头，然后将她的脸紧紧贴在自己的喉咙上。她非常平静。他那仿佛已经破碎的心带着一种剧痛在他的胸中燃烧着。接着他感到她的热泪慢慢湿润了他的喉咙。但是他不能动。","He could not bear to look at her any more.He dropped on his knees and caught her head with his arms and pressed her face against his throat.She was very still.His heart, which seemed to have broken, was burning with a kind of agony in his breast.And he felt her slow, hot tears wetting his throat.But he could not move."
"他感到这热泪湿润了他的脖子和颈窝，但是他仍然一动不动，仿佛悬在了人的某个来世之中。只有在这个时候，将她的脸紧紧地贴近他才是绝对必要的，他决不会再放开她了。他决不会让她的头从他胳膊的紧紧拥抱中离开。他想像这样永远继续下去，而他的心却使他受伤痛楚，这种痛楚对他来也是生活。他不知不觉地俯视着她潮湿、柔软的棕发。","He felt the hot tears wet his neck and the hollows of his neck, and he remained motionless, suspended through one of man’s eternities.Only now it had become indispensable to him to have her face pressed close to him; he could never let her go again.He could never let her head go away from the close clutch of his arm.He wanted to remain like that for ever, with his heart hurting him in a pain that was also life to him.Without knowing, he was looking down on her damp, soft brown hair."
"接着，仿佛是突然间，他闻到了极为讨厌的污水的气味。与此同时，她从他身旁缩回去，然后看着他。她的目光充满渴望，令人捉摸不定。他害怕这双眼睛，于是开始亲吻她，自己都不知道自己在干什么。他想让她的眼睛不再有那种可怕的、渴求的、捉摸不定的神情。","Then, as it were suddenly, he smelt the horrid stagnant smell of that water.And at the same moment she drew away from him and looked at him.Her eyes were wistful and unfathomable.He was afraid of them, and he fell to kissing her, not knowing what he was doing.He wanted her eyes not to have that terrible, wistful, unfathomable look."
"当她又将脸转向他时，脸上微微泛起了柔和的红晕，眼里再次出现异常喜悦的光芒，这的确让他感到恐惧，但也是他现在想看到的，因为他更害怕她怀疑的眼神。","When she turned her face to him again, a faint delicate flush was glowing, and there was again dawning that terrible shining of joy in her eyes, which really terrified him, and yet which he now wanted to see, because he feared the look of doubt still more."
"“你爱我？”她说得相当犹豫。","‘You love me?’ she said, rather faltering."
"“是的。”他费劲地说出这句话。不是因为这句话不真实。而是因为这是最近才发生的事实，这句话仿佛再次撕开了他新近被撕裂的心。而且他几乎不希望这是真的，即使是在此刻。","‘Yes.’ The word cost him a painful effort.Not because it wasn’t true.But because it was too newly true, the saying seemed to tear open again his newly-torn heart.And he hardly wanted it to be true, even now."
"她仰起脸对着他，于是他向前弯腰，温柔地亲吻她的嘴，伴随这个吻的是一个永恒的誓约。在他吻她的时候，他的心在胸中又紧缩起来。他从未打算爱她。但是现在这一切都结束了。他已经越过了与她之间的雷池，留在他身后的一切都干枯萎缩，变成了虚无。","She lifted her face to him, and he bent forward and kissed her on the mouth, gently, with the one kiss that is an eternal pledge.And as he kissed her his heart strained again in his breast.He never intended to love her.But now it was over.He had crossed over the gulf to her, and all that he had left behind had shrivelled and become void."
"这一吻之后，她的双眼又慢慢充满了泪水。她离开他，静静地坐着，脸朝一边低着，双手交叉放在膝上。眼泪非常缓慢地流下来。房间里鸦雀无声。他也沉默地坐在炉前的地毯上，纹丝不动。他那颗破碎之心的奇异痛苦仿佛要将他毁灭。他竟然会爱上她？这就是爱！他竟然就这样被撕裂开来！———他，一位医生！——如果他们知道了，会怎样嘲笑他啊！——想到他们也许会知道，他痛不欲生。","After the kiss, her eyes again slowly filled with tears.She sat still, away from him, with her face drooped aside, and her hands folded in her lap.The tears fell very slowly.There was complete silence.He too sat there motionless and silent on the hearthrug.The strange pain of his heart that was broken seemed to consume him.That he should love her?That this was love!That he should be ripped open in this way!—Him, a doctor!—How they would all jeer if they knew!—It was agony to him to think they might know."
"在这奇怪的、毫无遮掩的痛苦的思绪中，他又朝她望去。她正消沉地坐在那里，陷入了沉思。他看见一滴眼泪落了下来，于是他的心又炽热起来。房间里几乎暗下来了。朦胧中，他第一次看见她的一个肩膀完全没有遮掩，一只胳膊赤裸着，他能看见她的一个小乳房。","In the curious naked pain of the thought he looked again to her.She was sitting there drooped into a muse.He saw a tear fall, and his heart flared hot.He saw for the first time that one of her shoulders was quite uncovered, one arm bare, he could see one of her small breasts; dimly, because it had become almost dark in the room."
"“你为什么哭？”他变了口气问道。","‘Why are you crying?’ he asked, in an altered voice."
"她抬头看着他，透过泪水，她第一次意识到自己的处境，眼里流露出羞愧的阴郁神色。","She looked up at him, and behind her tears the consciousness of her situation for the first time brought a dark look of shame to her eyes."
"“我不是在哭，真的。”她说着，有些害怕地看着他。","‘I’m not crying, really,’ she said, watching him half frightened."
"他伸出手，温柔地握住她那只赤裸的胳膊。","He reached his hand, and softly closed it on her bare arm."
"“我爱你！我爱你！”他用一种温柔的、微微颤抖的声音说道，不像他自己。","‘I love you! I love you!’ he said in a soft, low vibrating voice, unlike himeslf."
"她退缩了，低下了头。他的手温柔而又富有穿透力地握着她的胳膊，令她痛苦忧伤。她抬头看着他。","She shrank, and dropped her head.The soft, penetrating grip of his hand on her arm distressed her.She looked up at him."
"“我想离开，”她说，“我想离开给你拿些干衣服。”","‘I want to go,’ she said.‘I want to go and get you some dry things.’"
"“为什么？“他说，“我很好。”","‘Why?’ he said.‘I’m all right.’"
"“但是我想去，”她说，“而且我想让你把衣服换了。”","‘But I want to go,’ she said.‘And I want you to change your things.’"
"他松开她的胳膊，于是她将自己裹在毯子里，十分恐惧地看着他。但她仍然没有站起来。","He released her arm, and she wrapped herself in the blanket, looking at him rather frightened.And still she did not rise."
"“吻我。”她渴望地说。","‘Kiss me,’ she said wistfully."
"他吻了她，但很短暂，有些生气的样子。","He kissed her, but briefly, half in anger."
"过了一会儿，她紧张不安地站起来，全身都裹在毯子里。当她设法让自己摆脱出来，将自己包裹好以便能够行走时，他一直看着她混乱不堪的样子。她知道他一直在看着她。当她走动的时候，毯子拖在后面。当他一眼瞥见她的双脚和白皙的腿时，他试着回忆当他将她裹在毯子里时她的样子。但是当时他不想记住，因为她当时对他来讲是个无关紧要的人，而且他的禀性让他厌恶去回忆当她对他无关紧要时她的样子。","Then, after a second, she rose nervously, all mixed up in the blanket.He watched her in her confusion, as she tried to extricate herself and wrap herself up so that she could walk.He watched her relentlessly, as she knew.And as she went, the blanket trailing, and as he saw a glimpse of her feet and her white leg, he tried to remember her as she was when he had wrapped her in the blanket.But then he didn’t want to remember, because she had been nothing to him then, and his nature revolted from remembering her as she was when she was nothing to him."
"昏暗的房子里一个低沉的跌落声吓了他一跳。然后他听到她的声音：“——是衣服。”他站起来走到楼梯脚下，拾起她扔下来的衣服。然后他回到壁炉边，擦干身子，穿上衣服。当他穿完衣服，看见自己的外表，他咧着嘴笑了。","A tumbling, muffled noise from within the dark house startled him.Then he heard her voice:—‘There are clothes.’He rose and went to the foot of the stairs, and gathered up the garments she had thrown down.Then he came back to the fire, to rub himself down and dress.He grinned at his own appearance when he had finished."
"炉火正在变小，于是他添了些煤。除了从远处冬青树间透射来的微弱的路灯灯光之外，房子里现在相当黑暗。他用壁炉台上找到的火柴点亮了煤气灯。然后他将自己衣服的口袋全都清空，并且将湿衣服堆成一堆扔进洗涤槽里。之后，他轻轻收起她透湿的衣服，将它们单独放成一堆，放在洗涤槽上方的铜盖上。","The fire was sinking, so he put on coal.The house was now quite dark, save for the light of a street-lamp that shone in faintly from beyond the holly trees.He lit the gas with matches he found on the mantel-piece.Then he emptied the pockets of his own clothes, and threw all his wet things in a heap into the scullery.After which he gathered up her sodden clothes, gently, and put them in a separate heap on the copper-top in the scullery."
"钟上的时间是六点。他自己的手表已经停了。他应当回诊所去了。他等着，但是她仍然没有下来。于是他走到楼梯脚下喊道：","It was six o’clock on the clock.His own watch had stopped.He ought to go back to the surgery.He waited, and still she did not come down.So he went to the foot of the stairs and called:"
"“我得走了。”","‘I shall have to go.’"
"他几乎立刻就听见她正在走下来。她穿上了她最好的黑色巴里纱连衣裙。她的头发整齐了，但仍然潮湿着。她看着他——然后不由自主地笑了。","Almost immediately he heard her coming down.She had on her best dress of black voile, and her hair was tidy, but still damp.She looked at him—and in spite of herself, smiled."
"“我不喜欢你穿着那些衣服。”她说。","‘I don’t like you in those clothes,’ she said."
"“我看上去是不是很可笑？”他回答说。","‘Do I look a sight?’ he answered."
"他们彼此都难为情。","They were shy of one another."
"“我去给你沏点茶。”她说。","‘I’ll make you some tea,’ she said."
"“不，我必须走了，”","‘No, I must go.’"
"“必须吗？”她用大大的、紧张的、疑惑的眼睛再次看着他。再一次，从他内心的痛苦里，他知道他是多么爱她。他走过去，然后弯下腰，带着内心的痛苦温柔、热情地去吻她。","‘Must you?’And she looked at him again with the wide, strained, doubtful eyes.And again, from the pain of his breast, he knew how he loved her.He went and bent to kiss her, gently, passionately, with his heart’s painful kiss."
"“我的头发太难闻了。”她心烦意乱地低声说，“我真是糟透了，我真是糟透了！噢，不，我真是太糟了。”她痛哭失声，伤心至极。“你不可能想要爱我，我太糟糕了。”","‘And my hair smells so horrible,’ she murmured in distraction.‘And I’m so awful, I’m so awful!Oh, no, I’m too awful.’And she broke into bitter, heart-broken sobbing.‘You can’t want to love me, I’m horrible.’"
"“别犯傻，别犯傻了，”他一边说，一边设法安慰她、亲吻她、把她搂在怀里，“我要你，我想要娶你，我们会结婚，很快，很快——如果我能够的话，就在明天。”","‘Don’t be silly, don’t be silly,’ he said, trying to comfort her, kissing her, holding her in his arms.‘I want you, I want to marry you, we’re going to be married, quickly, quickly—to-morrow if I can.’"
"但是她只是拼命地呜咽着，哭喊着：","But she only sobbed terribly, and cried:"
"“我感觉糟透了。我感觉糟透了。我觉得我对你来说糟透了。”","‘I feel awful.I feel awful.I feel I’m horrible to you.’"
"“不，我要你，我要你。”这就是他全部的回答，十分盲目，那可怕的语调几乎比她唯恐他不要她更使她感到恐惧。","‘No, I want you, I want you,’ was all he answered, blindly, with that terrible intonation which frightened her almost more than her horror lest he should not want her."
