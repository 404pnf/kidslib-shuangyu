"第二天（9月24日，礼拜二），我写好旅行日记并把背包修理好的时候已经下午两点钟了，因为我决定以后背着包赶路，不再费事地带着篮子了；半个小时后我动身前往梅尔夸森树林边上一个叫主教的谢拉尔的地方。有人告诉我，一个人走去那儿要花一个半小时；而我想，让一个被驴子拖累的人花上四个小时走完同样的路程，应该算不上过于野心勃勃吧。","The next day (Tuesday, September 24th), it was two o’clock in the afternoon before I got my journal written up and my knapsack repaired, for I was determined to carry my knapsack in the future and have no more ado with baskets; and half an hour afterwards I set out for Le Cheylard l’Evêque, a place on the borders of the forest of Mercoire. A man, I was told, should walk there in an hour and a half; and I thought it scarce too ambitious to suppose that a man encumbered with a donkey might cover the same distance in four hours."
"离开朗戈涅，我踏上了长长的上山路，一路上大雨或冰雹轮番袭来；风虽慢条斯理，但踌躇满志，越刮越紧；漫天的乌云自北方飞卷而来，一路追赶着我。有的带来阵阵急雨，下个不停，有的聚成块块阴霾，发着光亮，预示着行将飘落的雪花。我很快走出了阿列河流域已经开垦的盆地，远离了那些犁地的耕牛，和诸如此类的乡间景色。荒地、石南丛生的沼泽、岩石、松树驻守的小道，以及被秋天染得黄灿灿的白桦林，还有散布其间素面朝天的小茅屋，以及荒凉的旷野——这些便是乡间的特色。一重峦壑跟着又一重峦壑；一条条绿草丛生、遍布碎石的牛羊小道纵横交错，一会儿分出三四条小路，一会儿消失在沼泽深处的洼地中，又间或出现在山坡上或树林边。","All the way up the long hill from Langogne it rained and hailed alternately; the wind kept freshening steadily, although slowly; plentiful hurrying clouds—some dragging veils of straight rain-shower, others massed and luminous as though promising snow—careered out of the north and followed me along my way. I was soon out of the cultivated basin of the Allier, and away from the ploughing oxen, and such-like sights of the country. Moor, heathery marsh, tracts of rock and pines, woods of birch all jewelled with the autumn yellow, here and there a few naked cottages and bleak fields—these were the characters of the country. Hill and valley followed valley and hill; the little green and stony cattle-tracks wandered in and out of one another, split into three or four, died away in marshy hollows, and began again sporadically on hillsides or at the borders of a wood."
"这里没有直通谢拉尔的大路，而要想在这崎岖的乡间，在这时断时续的迷宫似的小径中找到一条出路，可绝非易事。我到萨涅鲁斯时肯定已经四点了，然后，因为有了一个确定的出发地点，我高高兴兴地继续上路了。两小时后，暮色迅速降临，风也暂时止住了。我从一片转了很久的冷杉林中钻出，发现出现在眼前的并不是自己想要找的村子，而是另一片乱山中的沼泽滩。我之前听到过前面有牲口铃铛的响声；现在，从树林的枝蔓中走出来后，我看到将近一打的母牛和大概同样多的黑影，我猜那是一群孩子，尽管薄雾夸大了他们的身影，让人几乎认不出来了。他们静静地一个跟着一个，不停地转着圈，一会儿牵着手，一会儿又围着圈分散开，互致敬意。孩子们的舞蹈，通常会引发人们天真、生动的暇想；然而，在黄昏的沼泽上，它看起来却怪诞诡谲。即使是我，虽然曾仔细研读过斯宾塞的著作，瞬间也感到某种突如其来的静默袭上心头。随后，我用刺棒赶小乖向前走，努力引领她穿过空地，就像在掌控一叶不羁的扁舟。走在小路上的时候，她顺着自己的心意固执地向前跑，好像顺风而行的小船；但是一旦走上一块草地，或走在石南丛中，这畜生就发起癫来。迷路的旅人那种绕着圈子到处找路的习惯在她身上达到了狂热的程度，即使要在一片空地上走出像样的直线，我也要使出浑身解数去驱赶她。","There was no direct road to Cheylard, and it was no easy affair to make a passage in this uneven country and through this intermittent labyrinth of tracks. It must have been about four when I struck Sagnerousse, and went on my way rejoicing in a sure point of departure. Two hours afterwards, the dusk rapidly falling, in a lull of the wind, I issued from a fir-wood where I had long been wandering, and found, not the looked-for village, but another marish bottom among rough-and-tumble hills. For some time past I had heard the ringing of cattle-bells ahead; and now, as I came out of the skirts of the wood, I saw near upon a dozen cows and perhaps as many more black figures, which I conjectured to be children, although the mist had almost unrecognisably exaggerated their forms. These were all silently following each other round and round in a circle, now taking hands, now breaking up with chains and reverences. A dance of children appeals to very innocent and lively thoughts; but, at nightfall on the marshes, the thing was eerie and fantastic to behold. Even I, who am well enough read in Herbert Spencer1, felt a sort of silence fall for an instant on my mind. The next, I was pricking Modestine forward, and guiding her like an unruly ship through the open. In a path, she went doggedly ahead of her own accord, as before a fair wind; but once on the turf or among heather, and the brute became demented. The tendency of lost travellers to go round in a circle was developed in her to the degree of passion, and it took all the steering I had in me to keep even a decently straight course through a single field."
"正当我东弯西拐地拼命在沼泽中穿行时，孩子们和牲口开始四散开来，最后只剩下两个女孩。我于是去向这两个女孩问路。乡下人一般不太愿意向旅人指路。曾经有一个老家伙，看到我向他走去，居然回到房子里，还关上了门；哪怕我上去拍打他的房门，叫破了喉咙，他也还是充耳不闻。还有一个人，给我指了路，但我后来发现我理解错了他说的话。可就算这样，他也只是得意地看着我误入歧途，却一声不吭。他完全不在乎我是否会迷路，是否会因此整夜在山里彷徨游荡！至于这两个女孩，她们是一对无礼又狡猾的小荡妇，满脑子恶作剧的念头。一个向我吐舌头，另一个让我跟着牛群走；她们咯咯傻笑，还相互用肘部轻推对方。那条热沃当的狼在这个地区吞吃了大概一百个孩子；我现在开始理解他的做法了。","While I was thus desperately tacking through the bog, children and cattle began to disperse, until only a pair of girls remained behind. From these I sought direction on my path. The peasantry in general were but little disposed to counsel a wayfarer. One old devil simply retired into his house, and barricaded the door on my approach; and I might beat and shout myself hoarse, he turned a deaf ear. Another, having given me a direction which, as I found afterwards, I had misunderstood, complacently watched me going wrong without adding a sign. He did not care a stalk of parsley if I wandered all night upon the hills! As for these two girls, they were a pair of impudent sly sluts, with not a thought but mischief. One put out her tongue at me, the other bade me follow the cows; and they both giggled and jogged each other’s elbows. The Beast of Gévaudan ate about a hundred children of this district; I began to think of him with sympathy."
"离开那两个女孩后，我继续在沼泽中跋涉，又走进一片树林，然后踏上一条路标明确的大路。夜色越来越浓了。小乖突然开始嗅出了危险的气息，自动调整步伐，从那以后再也没给我带来麻烦。这是我第一次发现这小家伙还有点儿头脑。与此同时，风又刮得急了，又一阵暴雨从北方急驰而来。在树林另一边，我看到，暮色中透出几扇红窗。这是富齐伊村，山坡上的白桦林边上有三户人家。我在这儿找到了一位和善可亲的老人家，他在雨中陪我走了一段，好把我安全地送上去谢拉尔的大路。他不肯要任何报酬，而是挥动着高高举起的手，好像受到他人威胁似的，还用纯粹的当地土话，不断地尖叫着拒绝。","Leaving the girls, I pushed on through the bog, and got into another wood and upon a well-marked road. It grew darker and darker. Modestine, suddenly beginning to smell mischief, bettered the pace of her own accord, and from that time forward gave me no trouble. It was the first sign of intelligence I had occasion to remark in her. At the same time, the wind freshened into half a gale, and another heavy discharge of rain came flying up out of the north. At the other side of the wood I sighted some red windows in the dusk. This was the hamlet of Fouzilhic; three houses on a hillside, near a wood of birches. Here I found a delightful old man, who came a little way with me in the rain to put me safely on the road for Cheylard. He would hear of no reward; but shook his hands above his head almost as if in menace, and refused volubly and shrilly, in unmitigated patois."
"最终似乎一切顺利。我的脑海中出现了晚餐和炉火，心情也变得愉悦起来。可是，唉，我万万没想到自己即将陷入又一个更加凄惨的境地！突然，夜幕倏地一下子完全拉下来了。我曾经多次在黑夜里身处野外，但却没有哪一次的夜晚比今夜更黑。影影绰绰的石块，模模糊糊的久经践踏的小径，还有蒙蒙眬眬的一团树影，像是黑夜中的黑夜——这就是我所能辨认出的一切。头上的天空是纯粹的一片漆黑；人眼甚至无法看到天上的云团怎样飞过。只要把手伸出一臂开外，就完全看不清哪儿是手，哪儿是路了；还有我的刺棒，伸出同样的距离，它看起来就和草地或天空融为一体了。","All seemed right at last. My thoughts began to turn upon dinner and a fireside, and my heart was agreeably softened in my bosom. Alas, and I was on the brink of new and greater miseries! Suddenly, at a single swoop, the night fell. I have been abroad in many a black night, but never in a blacker. A glimmer of rocks, a glimmer of the track where it was well beaten, a certain f leecy density, or night within night, for a tree—this was all that I could discriminate. The sky was simply darkness overhead; even the flying clouds pursued their way invisibly to human eyesight. I could not distinguish my hand at arm’s-length from the track, nor my goad, at the same distance, from the meadows or the sky."
"很快，我走的大路就像其他乡间的路一样开始分岔，它在一处布满岩石的草地上分成了三四条小路。因为小乖看起来特别迷恋这种踏出来的小路，因此，我试着利用她的直觉来走出这种困境。但是一头蠢驴的直觉，光听名字就该料想得到是怎样的了；足足半分钟的时间，她都在巨石间吃力地转来转去，正如我们料想的那样，完全不知所措。如果我带了足够的食物和水，早就应该露营了；但因为这段路并不长，所以我没有带酒，也没有为自己准备面包，只为我的雌性朋友带了大概一磅多一点儿。更糟的是，由于下雨，我和小乖浑身上下都湿透了。即使如此，如果能找到些水的话，我也将不顾一切立即在此露营。但是，除了正在下着的雨水，我完全找不到一点水。我决定返回富齐伊村，请一位向导带我再往前走一点——“借你指路的手稍稍前进一程。”","Soon the road that I was following split, after the fashion of the country, into three or four in a piece of rocky meadow. Since Modestine had shown such a fancy for beaten roads, I tried her instinct in this predicament. But the instinct of an ass is what might be expected from the name; in half a minute she was clambering round and round among some boulders, as lost a donkey as you would wish to see. I should have camped long before had I been properly provided; but as this was to be so short a stage, I had brought no wine, no bread for myself, and little over a pound for my lady friend. Add to this, that I and Modestine were both handsomely wetted by the showers. But now, if I could have found some water, I should have camped at once in spite of all. Water, however, being entirely absent, except in the form of rain, I determined to return to Fouzilhic, and ask a guide a little farther on my way—“a little farther lend thy guiding hand.”2"
"想起来容易，做起来就难了。在这狂风呼啸的黑夜里，除了风向，我无法确定任何东西。我逆风而行；道路消失了，我在田野中穿行而过，一会儿走入大片的沼泽中，一会儿又被小乖越不过去的障碍挡住，直到我又一次看到一些红色窗扇。这次窗户的格局与上次的不同。这里不是富齐伊村，而是富齐阿村，离富齐伊不远的一个小村，但村民们的态度却迥异。我把小乖拴在路旁，自己摸着黑往前走，不是被石头绊得跌跌撞撞，就是陷入及膝的沼泽中，最后终于来到村子的入口。第一所亮着灯火的房子里有一个妇女，她不愿为我开门。她在门里冲着我喊道，她一个人住，又是个瘸子，什么也做不了；但如果我去隔壁，那里有个男人，如果他愿意的话，可以帮得到我。","The thing was easy to decide, hard to accomplish. In this sensible roaring blackness I was sure of nothing but the direction of the wind. To this I set my face; the road had disappeared, and I went across country, now in marshy opens, now baffled by walls unscalable to Modestine, until I came once more in sight of some red windows. This time they were differently disposed. It was not Fouzilhic, but Fouzilhac, a hamlet little distant from the other in space, but worlds away in the spirit of its inhabitants. I tied Modestine to a gate, and groped forward, stumbling among rocks, plunging mid-leg in bog, until I gained the entrance of the village. In the first lighted house there was a woman who would not open to me. She could do nothing, she cried to me through the door, being alone and lame; but if I would apply at the next house, there was a man who could help me if he had a mind."
"在隔壁，一个男人、两个妇女和一个女孩涌到门口，还提了两盏灯笼，来好好审视我这位旅行者。这男人长得倒不像坏人，但有一副狡黠的笑容。他倚着门柱，听我讲述我的情况。我所需要的只是一位能把我带到谢拉尔的向导。","They came to the next door in force, a man, two women, and a girl, and brought a pair of lanterns to examine the wayfarer. The man was not ill-looking, but had a shifty smile. He leaned against the doorpost, and heard me state my case. All I asked was a guide as far as Cheylard."
"“现在，你看，天黑了。”他说。","“C’est que, voyez-vous, il fait noir,” said he."
"我告诉他这正是我寻求帮助的原因。","I told him that was just my reason for requiring help."
"“我知道，”他说，一副不情愿的模样，“可这，很麻烦呀。”","“I understand that,” said he, looking uncomfortable; “Mais—c’est—de la peine.”"
"我愿意付钱，我说。他摇摇头。我出到十法郎；可他还是摇头。“你开价吧。”我说。","I was willing to pay, I said. He shook his head. I rose as high as ten francs; but he continued to shake his head. “Name your own price, then,” said I."
"“不是那么回事儿，”他最后说，明显很为难，“但是我不会出门的——maisjenesortiraipasdelaporte（但是我不会出门的）。”","“Ce n’est pas ca,” he said at length, and with evident difficulty; “but I am not going to cross the door—mais je ne sortirai pas de la porte.”"
"我有点发恼，问他他认为我该怎么办。","I grew a little warm, and asked him what he proposed that I should do."
"“到了谢拉尔后，你还要去哪儿？”他不答反问。","“Where are you going beyond Cheylard?” he asked by way of answer."
"“那不关你的事，”我回答，因为我可不想再纵容他残忍的好奇心了，“这又不会对我眼下的困境有任何改变。”","“That is no affair of yours,” I returned, for I was not going to indulge his bestial curiosity; “it changes nothing in my present predicament.”"
"“是呀，”他大笑着承认，“是这么回事。你从哪儿来的呀？”","“C’est vrai,ca,” he acknowledged, with a laugh; “Oui, c’est vrai. Et d’ou venez-vous?”"
"教养再好的人兴许也要发火了。","A better man than I might have felt nettled."
"“啊，”我说，“我不会回答你任何问题了，所以你也不必费神再问了。我现在已经够迟了；我需要帮助。如果你自己不愿给我带路，最起码帮我找个愿意的人吧。”","“O,” said I, “I am not going to answer any of your questions, so you may spare yourself the trouble of putting them. I am late enough already; I want help. If you will not guide me yourself, at least help me to find some one else who will.”"
"“等一下，”他突然叫道，“你不就是白天那个穿过草地的人吗？”","“Hold on,” he cried suddenly. “Was it not you who passed in the meadow while it was still day?”"
"“是的，是的，”女孩说，我刚刚没认出她来，“就是那位先生；我让他跟着牛走。”","“Yes, yes,” said the girl, whom I had not hitherto recognised; “it was monsieur; I told him to follow the cow.”"
"“而你，小姐，”我说，“你是位爱捣蛋的小丑。”","“As for you, mademoiselle,” said I, “you are a farceuse.”"
"“那么，”男人接着说，“你到底怎么走的？现在还在这里转悠？”","“And,” added the man, “what the devil have you done to be still here?”"
"到底怎么回事，真是！但我就是还在这儿。","What the devil, indeed! But there I was."
"“重要的是，”我说道，“结束这一切。”然后又提议他应该帮我找一个向导。","“The great thing,” said I, “is to make an end of it”; and once more proposed that he should help me to find a guide."
"“天色，”他又说，“天色太黑了。”","“C’est que,” he said again, “C’est que-il fait noir.”"
"“很好。”我说，“提一个灯笼就是了。”","“Very well,” said I; “take one of your lanterns.”"
"“不行，”他叫道，他的思绪又倒回去，又躲回到他之前的借口背后，“我不会出门的。”","“No,” he cried, drawing a thought backward, and again intrenching himself behind one of his former phrases; “I will not cross the door.”"
"我看着他。在他脸上，真实的的恐惧与真实的的羞愧在交锋；他可怜地微笑着，伸出舌头舔舔嘴唇，像一个做了错事被抓到的男孩。我大概想了一下自己目前的处境，问他我该怎么办。","I looked at him. I saw unaffected terror struggling on his face with unaffected shame; he was smiling pitifully and wetting his lip with his tongue, like a detected schoolboy. I drew a brief picture of my state, and asked him what I was to do."
"“我不知道。”他说，“我不会出门的。”","“I don’t know,” he said; “I will not cross the door.”"
"他怕的是热沃当之狼，一点儿没错。","Here was the Beast of Gévaudan, and no mistake."
"“先生，”我说，用我最威严的态度，“你是一个懦夫。”","“Sir,” said I, with my most commanding manners, “you are a coward.”"
"说完，我背转身，离开了这一大家子。他们立刻退回到他们的堡垒中；那扇经典的门重新关上了，但门关上前，我听到一阵笑声。“野蛮的女儿，必有其更野蛮的父亲。”还是让我用复数来说吧：一群热沃当之狼。","And with that I turned my back upon the family party, who hastened to retire within their fortifications; and the famous door was closed again, but not till I had overheard the sound of laughter. Filia barbara pater barbarior. Let me say it in the plural: the Beasts of Gévaudan."
"那两盏灯笼有些照花了我的眼，我深一脚浅一脚地在石块和垃圾堆之间痛苦地穿行。村中所有其他房屋都是一片漆黑寂静。尽管我不停地敲着这家那户的门，却得不到任何应答。真是糟糕透顶，我一边诅咒，一边离开了富齐阿。雨已经停了，风还是越刮越紧，开始吹干我的上衣和裤子。“很好，”我想，“不管有没有水，我都必须露营了。”但首先要回去牵小乖。我很确定，我在黑暗中摸索了足有二十分钟才找到我的小母驴；而且，要不是那块不太友好的沼泽的帮忙，让我又跌倒了一次，我可能到天亮还在找她呢。我下面要做的是去树林里避风，因为风刮得又冷又凶。在这个树木繁茂的地区，为何我却花了好久才找到一片树林，这是我这天探险的又一个难解之谜；但我发誓，我花了将近一个小时才找到了它。","The lanterns had somewhat dazzled me, and I ploughed distressfully among stones and rubbish-heaps. All the other houses in the village were both dark and silent; and though I knocked at here and there a door, my knocking was unanswered. It was a bad business; I gave up Fouzilhac with my curses. The rain had stopped, and the wind, which still kept rising, began to dry my coat and trousers. “Very well,” thought I, “water or no water, I must camp.” But the first thing was to return to Modestine. I am pretty sure I was twenty minutes groping for my lady in the dark; and if it had not been for the unkindly services of the bog, into which I once more stumbled, I might have still been groping for her at the dawn. My next business was to gain the shelter of a wood, for the wind was cold as well as boisterous. How, in this well-wooded district, I should have been so long in finding one, is another of the insoluble mysteries of this day’s adventures; but I will take my oath that I put near an hour to the discovery."
"最终，一些黑色的树影出现在我的左侧，然后，那些树木徒然穿过大路在我的正前方形成了一个黑沉沉的洞穴。我称它为洞穴丝毫没有夸张；在这些枝枝蔓蔓形成的拱门下面穿行，就像进入地牢里一样。我四处摸索着，直到我的手触到了一根结实的树枝，就把小乖拴在它上面。这时小乖已经筋疲力尽、浑身透湿，没精打采极了。我卸下行李，把它沿着路边的墙放好，解开睡袋皮带的扣子。我很清楚灯笼在哪里；但是蜡烛呢？我在杂乱无章的物品里摸索了半天。然后，就在我这样搜寻着的时候，突然我触到了酒精灯。得救了！用这个也不错。狂风在林间呼啸着，全无止息的迹象。在方圆半英里的树林里，我听得到树枝被摇撼得颠簸不已，树叶在风中上下翻飞；但我的露营之地不但像深坑般漆黑一团，而且还是很好的遮护之处。擦了第二根火柴之后，灯芯就点着了。灯光暗淡摇曳，却把我和外面的世界隔绝开来，还衬得周围的夜色愈见漆黑。","At last black trees began to show upon my left, and, suddenly crossing the road, made a cave of unmitigated blackness right in front. I call it a cave without exaggeration; to pass below that arch of leaves was like entering a dungeon. I felt about until my hand encountered a stout branch, and to this I tied Modestine, a haggard, drenched, desponding donkey. Then I lowered my pack, laid it along the wall on the margin of the road, and unbuckled the straps. I knew well enough where the lantern was; but where were the candles? I groped and groped among the tumbled articles, and, while I was thus groping, suddenly I touched the spirit-lamp. Salvation! This would serve my turn as well. The wind roared unwearyingly among the trees; I could hear the boughs tossing and the leaves churning through half a mile of forest; yet the scene of my encampment was not only as black as the pit, but admirably sheltered. At the second match the wick caught flame. The light was both livid and shifting; but it cut me off from the universe, and doubled the darkness of the surrounding night."
"我把小乖拴得更舒服一点，掰碎半块黑面包作她的晚餐，留着另外半块作早餐。然后把可能用得着的东西放在我触手可及之处，脱下湿漉漉的靴子和绑腿，把它们裹在雨衣里，把背包整好，放在睡袋的袋盖下面作枕头，慢慢钻入睡袋里，用带子把自己绑得像个小婴儿似的。我打开一听大红肠罐头，又撕下一块巧克力蛋糕，这就是我所有的食物了。这听起来似乎很令人作呕，但我就像吃夹肉面包一样，把它们一口一口吃完了。唯一能够让我拿来冲下这些令人反胃食物的是纯白兰地：它本身就是难以下咽的饮料。但是我实在饿极了。我美美地享用完晚餐，又抽了一根我平生抽过的最好的香烟。接着我把一块石头放进我的草帽里，拉下皮帽子的帽沿遮住脖子和眼睛，把我的左轮手枪放在手边，舒舒服服地蜷缩进这些羊皮中间。","I tied Modestine more conveniently for herself, and broke up half the black bread for her supper, reserving the other half against the morning. Then I gathered what I should want within reach, took off my wet boots and gaiters, which I wrapped in my waterproof, arranged my knapsack for a pillow under the flap of my sleeping-bag, insinuated my limbs into the interior, and buckled myself in like a bambino. I opened a tin of Bologna sausage and broke a cake of chocolate, and that was all I had to eat. It may sound offensive, but I ate them together, bite by bite, by way of bread and meat. All I had to wash down this revolting mixture was neat brandy: a revolting beverage in itself. But I was rare and hungry; ate well, and smoked one of the best cigarettes in my experience. Then I put a stone in my straw hat, pulled the flap of my fur cap over my neck and eyes, put my revolver ready to my hand, and snuggled well down among the sheepskins."
"我一开始还怀疑自己是否有睡意，因为我感到心跳得比平常要快，好像怀着一种自己还不熟悉的愉快的兴奋感。但我的上眼皮一触到下眼皮，就有一种奇妙的胶水在它们中间跳跃，它们就再也分不开了。林间的风声是我的催眠曲。有时连续几分钟这风声都像是平滑稳定的急流，既不增强，也不减弱；有时又会突然暴涨，急剧迸放，仿佛撞击着的巨浪，然后下午残留在树叶上的大颗雨滴，就会噼里啪啦地拍打在我全身上下。夜复一夜，在故乡我自己的卧室里，我曾仔细聆听这使人心烦意乱的风林协奏曲；但不知是因为树林的不同，还是所处的地形不同，抑或是因为我身在野外，处于这风声之中，总之事实却是，热沃当的林中之风唱出的是不同的曲调。我静静地倾听着，倾听着；与此同时，睡意渐渐俘获了我的身体，麻痹了我的思想和感觉；但陷入睡眠的最后一瞬，我仍在努力聆听、辨认，在最后的一丝清明中，我还在惊讶于耳中那陌生的嘈杂之声。","I questioned at first if I were sleepy, for I felt my heart beating faster than usual, as if with an agreeable excitement to which my mind remained a stranger. But as soon as my eyelids touched, that subtle glue leaped between them, and they would no more come separate. The wind among the trees was my lullaby. Sometimes it sounded for minutes together with a steady, even rush, not rising nor abating; and again it would swell and burst like a great crashing breaker, and the trees would patter me all over with big drops from the rain of the afternoon. Night after night, in my own bedroom in the country, I have given ear to this perturbing concert of the wind among the woods; but whether it was a difference in the trees, or the lie of the ground, or because I was myself outside and in the midst of it, the fact remains that the wind sang to a different tune among these woods of Gévaudan. I hearkened and hearkened; and meanwhile sleep took gradual possession of my body and subdued my thoughts and senses; but still my last waking effort was to listen and distinguish, and my last conscious state was one of wonder at the foreign clamour in my ears."
"我在黑夜里醒来了两次——一次是睡袋下面的一块石头硌醒了我，另一次是可怜的好脾气的小乖生起气来，不停地用蹄子刨土跺地——我短暂地清醒了一下，看到头上有一两点星光，一簇簇枝叶的边缘像花边一样嵌在夜空中。我第三次醒来时（9月25日，礼拜三），整个世界沐浴在一片蓝光之中，这是黎明的前兆。我看到叶子在风中不停地摇曳，大路像一条长长的缎带；转过头来，小乖拴在一棵山毛榉上，半边身子站在路上，态度无比乖顺。我又闭上了眼睛，开始回想夜间的经历。我惊讶地发现，尽管风狂雨骤，我过得还是很轻松愉快的。如果我不是被迫在这晦暗的夜晚摸黑露营的话，让我烦恼不已的那块石头也不会出现在那里；而且，除了我的脚在睡袋中的一堆杂物中碰到了灯笼，或是佩拉的《荒漠中的牧师》第二卷，我也没有感到其他的不便之处；不仅如此，我丝毫没有感觉到寒冷，而且还在不寻常的惬意和清醒的意识中醒来。","Twice in the course of the dark hours—once when a stone galled me underneath the sack, and again when the poor patient Modestine, growing angry, pawed and stamped upon the road—I was recalled for a brief while to consciousness, and saw a star or two overhead, and the lace-like edge of the foliage against the sky. When I awoke for the third time (Wednesday, September 25th), the world was flooded with a blue light, the mother of the dawn. I saw the leaves labouring in the wind and the ribbon of the road; and, on turning my head, there was Modestine tied to a beech, and standing half across the path in an attitude of inimitable patience. I closed my eyes again, and set to thinking over the experience of the night. I was surprised to find how easy and pleasant it had been, even in this tempestuous weather. The stone which annoyed me would not have been there, had I not been forced to camp blindfold in the opaque night; and I had felt no other inconvenience, except when my feet encountered the lantern or the second volume of Peyrat’s Pastors of the Desert3 among the mixed contents of my sleeping-bag; nay, more, I had felt not a touch of cold, and awakened with unusually lightsome and clear sensations."
"带着这份惬意清醒，我振作精神，重新穿上靴子和绑腿。然后，掰碎剩下的面包喂了小乖，又四处走走，看我到底是在世界的哪个角落醒来的。被留在伊萨卡岛上的尤利西斯，因为女神而心神不宁，绝不像我现在这般因迷路而愉快。我一生渴求探险，那种完全冷静理智的探险，就像那些早期英勇的航行者经历的那样。因此早晨发现自己在热沃当任意一个林边角落醒来，——不辨南北，就像世界上出现的第一个人那样对周围的一切那样陌生，堪称一个历经陆地“漂流”的“鲁宾逊”——等于是实现了我的一部分幻想。我身处一小片白桦林的边缘，林间掺杂着几棵山毛榉树；白桦林后面邻着一片冷杉林；而前面，树木不再聚集成林，稀稀落落地散入一个绿草如茵的浅浅山谷。那里四周都是些光秃秃的山头，近观或是远眺，会发现有的山在近处，有的在远处，但没有一座明显兀立于其他山头。大风把树的枝叶都吹拢在一起，白桦林点点金黄的秋叶在风中瑟瑟发抖。头顶上空飘荡着丝丝缕缕的雾气，在风儿的追赶下飞扬着，忽隐忽现，有时还像杂技演员般翻着筋斗。这时天气恶劣，空气冷峭逼人。趁手指还没被冻僵，我赶紧吃了些巧克力，灌下一口白兰地，还抽了一根烟。我吃喝完毕，整好行囊并把它缚在驮鞍上，这时，东方才依稀现出了几缕晨光。我们在路上没走几步，就看到，虽然太阳还没出来，但金灿灿的光芒已经照亮了东方天边云雾中绵延的群山。","With that, I shook myself, got once more into my boots and gaiters, and, breaking up the rest of the bread for Modestine, strolled about to see in what part of the world I had awakened. Ulysses, left on Ithaca4 and with a mind unsettled by the goddess, was not more pleasantly astray. I have been after an adventure all my life, a pure dispassionate adventure, such as befell early and heroic voyagers; and thus to be found by morning in a random woodside nook in Gévaudan—not knowing north from south, as strange to my surroundings as the first man upon the earth, an inland castaway—was to find a fraction of my day-dreams realised. I was on the skirts of a little wood of birch, sprinkled with a few beeches; behind, it adjoined another wood of fir; and in front, it broke up and went down in open order into a shallow and meadowy dale. All around there were bare hilltops, some near, some far away, as the perspective closed or opened, but none apparently much higher than the rest. The wind huddled the trees. The golden specks of autumn in the birches tossed shiveringly. Overhead the sky was full of strings and shreds of vapour, flying, vanishing, reappearing, and turning about an axis like tumblers, as the wind hounded them through heaven. It was wild weather and famishing cold. I ate some chocolate, swallowed a mouthful of brandy, and smoked a cigarette before the cold should have time to disable my fingers. And by the time I had got all this done, and had made my pack and bound it on the pack-saddle, the day was tiptoe on the threshold of the east. We had not gone many steps along the lane, before the sun, still invisible to me, sent a glow of gold over some cloud mountains that lay ranged along the eastern sky. "
"狂风自我们身后吹来，猛烈地吹着我们向前走。我把自己严密地扣在大衣里，怀着愉快的心情和大家一起走着。忽然，在一个转角处，富齐伊村又一次出现在我的眼前。不光如此，还有那位前夜护送了我很远的老人家，一看到我，就跑出了他的屋子，手惊恐地高高举着。","The wind had us on the stern, and hurried us bitingly forward. I buttoned myself into my coat, and walked on in a pleasant frame of mind with all men, when suddenly, at a corner, there was Fouzilhic once more in front of me. Nor only that, but there was the old gentleman who had escorted me so far the night before, running out of his house at sight of me, with hands upraised in horror."
"“可怜的孩子！”他喊道，“这是怎么回事？”","“My poor boy!” he cried, “what does this mean?”"
"我告诉他事情的经过。他像磨坊里的拍板那样拍打着他苍老的双手，觉得自己就那样放我走真是太轻率了；但一听到富齐阿村的那个男人，这位老人立刻表现得义愤填膺，神情沮丧。","I told him what had happened. He beat his old hands like clappers in a mill, to think how lightly he had let me go; but when he heard of the man of Fouzilhac, anger and depression seized upon his mind."
"“这次，至少，”他说，“不会再走错路了。”","“This time, at least,” said he, “there shall be no mistake.”"
"于是他就一瘸一拐地向前走，因为他风湿病非常严重。我们走了大概半英里，直到我的目的地，谢拉尔，出现在我们的视野里。","And he limped along, for he was very rheumatic, for about half a mile, and until I was almost within sight of Cheylard, the destination I had."
"5.谢拉尔和吕克","V. Cheylard And Luc"
"6.阿波利纳里斯神父","VI. Father Apollinaris"
"7.修道士","VII. The Monks"
"迈克尔神父三十五岁上下，温雅可亲，气色极佳，总在微笑着。他把我带到食品室里，给了我一杯利口酒，让我在正餐之前垫垫饥。我们聊了一会儿，或者应该说，他很有耐心地听我喋喋不休地瞎扯，只不过显得心不在焉，像附在肉体上的一缕游魂。老实说，当我想起我那时主要是在对我的胃口大加阐述，而迈克尔神父在超过十八个小时之前只是吃了些碎面包时，我便完全明白，他一定觉得我的话鄙俗不堪。但他的态度，虽然有些高傲，却还是非常亲切的。我对于迈克尔神父的过去暗自好奇了起来。","Father Michael, a pleasant, fresh-faced, smiling man, perhaps of thirty-five, took me to the pantry, and gave me a glass of liqueur1 to stay me until dinner. We had some talk, or rather I should say he listened to my prattle indulgently enough, but with an abstracted air, like a spirit with a thing of clay. And truly, when I remember that I descanted principally on my appetite, and that it must have been by that time more than eighteen hours since Father Michael had so much as broken bread, I can well understand that he would find an earthly savour in my conversation. But his manner, though superior, was exquisitely gracious; and I find I have a lurking curiosity as to Father Michael’s past."
"享用过那杯开胃酒之后，我被一个人留在修道院的花园里，在那儿呆了一小会儿。花园跟主庭院差不多大小，错综排布着一条条沙路和一块块种着各色大丽花的花圃。花园中央还有一个喷泉和一座黑色圣母像。四周环绕着的房屋，方方正正、样式单调，像是还没有经过岁月和风雨的洗礼，除了一座钟楼和两面石板山墙外，没有其他特色。身着白色或褐色长袍的修道士默默地走过铺满沙的小路；我刚到园中的时候，三位戴着兜帽的修道士正跪在阳台上祷告。修道院的一侧是一座光秃秃的小山，另一侧则是一片树林。它处于风口上，从十月到次年五月，雪断断续续地下着，有时积雪长达六个礼拜不化；但即使是在有着天堂般气候的伊甸园里，这些建筑物本身也会同样给人以冬天般冷寂阴郁的感觉。就我而言，在这凄清的九月，没有吃饭前，我觉得里里外外都冷飕飕的。","The whet administered, I was left alone for a little in the monastery garden. This is no more than the main court, laid out in sandy paths and beds of parti-coloured dahlias, and with a fountain and a black statue of the Virgin in the centre. The buildings stand around it four-square, bleak, as yet unseasoned by the years and weather, and with no other features than a belfry and a pair of slated gables. Brothers in white, brothers in brown, passed silently along the sanded alleys; and when I first came out, three hooded monks were kneeling on the terrace at their prayers. A naked hill commands the monastery upon one side, and the wood commands it on the other. It lies exposed to wind; the snow falls off and on from October to May, and sometimes lies six weeks on end; but if they stood in Eden, with a climate like heaven’s, the buildings themselves would offer the same wintry and cheerless aspect; and for my part, on this wild September day, before I was called to dinner, I felt chilly in and out."
"痛痛快快饱餐一顿后，安布罗斯修士，一位爽朗健谈的法国人（所有负责接待访客的修道士都可以自由谈话），把我带到楼中专为隐居修行者辟出的一部分地方里的一间小屋里。小屋干净整洁，墙壁刷成了白色，陈设着必需的家具，一个十字架，一座已故教皇的半身像，法文版的《效仿基督》——一本关于宗教冥想的书，还有一本《伊丽莎白.西顿传》，记叙的似乎是一位在北美、特别是新英格兰地区传教的福音传教士。据我的经验，其他传教士也有平等的机会在这些地区宣讲福音；但是想想科顿.马瑟吧！我很想让他在天堂里读一下这本小书——希望他现在是在天堂里；但可能他已经懂得这些了，而且可能懂得更多；可能他和西顿夫人已成为知己，并一起快乐地吟咏着永恒的圣歌。桌子上方——那里有这间屋子的最后一件陈设——挂着一套隐居者的行为规范：需要参加哪些宗教仪式，何时数念珠祷告或冥想，何时起床，何时休息。最下面是一个很显眼的注意事项：“闲暇时须自省良心，须忏悔，须下好的决心，等等。”须下好的决心，真是这样啊！你可以同样骄傲地谈起你的决心：让头上生出头发。","When I had eaten well and heartily, Brother Ambrose, a hearty conversible Frenchman (for all those who wait on strangers have the liberty to speak), led me to a little room in that part of the building which is set apart for MM. les retraitants. It was clean and whitewashed, and furnished with strict necessaries, a crucifix, a bust of the late Pope, the Imitation2 in French, a book of religious meditations, and the Life of Elizabeth Seton3, evangelist, it would appear, of North merica and of New England in particular. As far as my experience goes, there is a fair field for some more evangelisation in these quarters; but think of Cotton Mather4! I should like to give him a reading of this little work in heaven, where I hope he dwells; but perhaps he knows all that already, and much more; and perhaps he and Mrs. Seton are the dearest friends, and gladly unite their voices in the everlasting psalm. Over the table, to conclude the inventory of the room, hung a set of regulations for MM. les retraitants: what services they should attend, when they were to tell their beads or meditate, and when they were to rise and go to rest. At the foot was a notable N.B.: “Le temps libre est employé à l’examen de conscience, à la confession, à, faire de bonnes résolutions, etc.” To make good resolutions, indeed! You might talk as fruitfully of making the hair grow on your head."
"我还没有好好探究一番我所处的环境，安布罗斯修士就回来了。好像有一位英国寄宿者想跟我交谈一下。我同意了，于是安布罗斯修士带来一位精力充沛的矮个子爱尔兰人，五十岁上下，是教会的副主祭，穿着不折不扣的牧师法衣，头上戴着一顶——因为我的无知，我只能称之为——平顶桶状教士帽。他曾在比利时的女修道院里隐居修行了七年，如今在雪中圣母院住了五年了；他还从未见过一份英文报纸；他法语说得不甚流利，而且就算他能说得像当地人那样好，他住的地方也没有多少谈话的机会。正因为这样，他非常热爱交际，渴望听到新闻，思想单纯得像个孩子。如果我想要一位向导陪同游览一下修道院，那么他是非常高兴可以看到一张英国人的脸孔，听到英国乡音的。","I had scarce explored my niche when Brother Ambrose returned. An English boarder, it appeared, would like to speak with me. I professed my willingness, and the friar ushered in a fresh, young, little Irishman of fifty, a deacon of the Church, arrayed in strict canonicals, and wearing on his head what, in default of knowledge, I can only call the ecclesiastical shako. He had lived seven years in retreat at a convent of nuns in Belgium, and now five at Our Lady of the Snows; he never saw an English newspaper; he spoke French imperfectly, and had he spoken it like a native, there was not much chance of conversation where he dwelt. With this, he was a man eminently sociable, greedy of news, and simple-minded like a child. If I was pleased to have a guide about the monastery, he was no less delighted to see an English face and hear an English tongue."
"他带我看了他自己的房间，他在那里读祈祷书，《希伯来圣经》和韦弗利系列小说以打发时间。然后他带我去了回廊，进入牧师会礼堂，穿过法衣室，那里挂着修士们的长袍和阔檐草帽，每件上面都有块牌子，牌子上写着他们的教名——都是些富有传奇色彩、文雅而有趣的名字，如巴西勒、希拉里翁、拉斐尔或帕西菲克。然后我们进了藏书室，那里有弗约和夏多布里昂的所有作品，竟然还有雨果的《颂歌与杂诗》，甚至还有莫里哀的剧作，更不用说数不清的神父的著作和很多当地和世界历史书籍了。随后我那善良的爱尔兰同伴带我转了修道院内的工场，修士们在那儿烤面包、造车轮、拍照片；一名修士在那儿管理收藏的古玩，另一个在照看一群兔子。因为在特拉普派的修道院里，除了宗教方面的职责和修道院一般的劳役外，每个修道者都有自己所选择的工作。如果嗓音和听力方面没有缺陷，每人都必须在唱诗班里唱圣歌；如果手臂可以自由挥动，就必须参加割晒干草的劳动；但在他自由支配的时间里，尽管必须有事可做，但却可以选择自己喜欢的事情。因此我听说一位修士从事文学创作，而阿波利纳里斯神父则忙于修筑道路，院长选择的是装订书籍的工作。顺便说一下，院长被授予这一圣职还没多久；在任职仪式上，作为一项特殊的恩遇，他的母亲被允许进入小礼拜堂，亲眼目睹了授职仪式。看到自己的儿子成为戴着主教冠的修道院院长，真是让做母亲的倍感骄傲的一天；这样一想，人们也会为他们让她进去观礼而感到高兴。","He showed me his own room, where he passed his time among breviaries, Hebrew Bibles, and the Waverley Novels5. Thence he led me to the cloisters, into the chapter-house, through the vestry, where the brothers'gowns and broad straw hats were hanging up, each with his religious name upon a board—names full of legendary suavity and interest, such as Basil, Hilarion, Raphael, or Pacifique6; Into the library, where were all the works of Veuillot7 and Chateaubriand8, and the Odes et Ballades, if you please, and even Moliére9, to say nothing of innumerable fathers and a great variety of local and general historians. Thence my good Irishman took me round the workshops, where brothers bake bread, and make cartwheels, and take photographs; where one superintends a collection of curiosities, and another a gallery of rabbits. For in a Trappist monastery each monk has an occupation of his own choice, apart from his religious duties and the general labours of the house. Each must sing in the choir, if he has a voice and ear, and join in the haymaking if he has a hand to stir; but in his private hours, although he must be occupied, he may be occupied on what he likes. Thus I was told that one brother was engaged with literature; while Father Apollinaris busies himself in making roads, and the Abbot employs himself in binding books. It is not so long since this Abbot was consecrated, by the way; and on that occasion, by a special grace, his mother was permitted to enter the chapel and witness the ceremony of consecration. A proud day for her to have a son a mitred abbot; it makes you glad to think they let her in."
"我们就这样在修道院里转来转去，路上遇到很多默默走着的神父和修士。他们通常并不注意我们，仿佛我们只是天上的浮云；但有时他们也允许这位善良的副主祭向他们询问，这种许可是通过双手的一种奇特的动作表达的，很像小狗游泳时前爪的动作，或者他们会用常用的否定手势拒绝他。不管是许可还是拒绝，他们都垂着眼帘，带着一副悔罪的神情，像是一个马上要被引向罪恶深渊的人。","In all these journeyings to and fro, many silent fathers and brethren fell in our way. Usually they paid no more regard to our passage than if we had been a cloud; but sometimes the good deacon had a permission to ask of them, and it was granted by a peculiar movement of the hands, almost like that of a dog’s paws in swimming, or refused by the usual negative signs, and in either case with lowered eyelids and a certain air of contrition, as of a man who was steering very close to evil."
"由于院长的特殊恩惠，这些修道士仍是一日两餐；但现在已经是他们的长斋期了，斋期从九月份的某个时候开始，一直持续到复活节。在这期间，他们在二十四小时内只进一次餐，时间是在下午两点，这时他们已经劳作祷告了十二个小时了。他们的食物非常俭素，但即便如此，他们还是吃得很克制。尽管每人可以得到一小瓶酒，但很多人还是忍住了诱惑。毫无疑问，多数世人都吃得过多；食物不仅满足我们生存的需要，还是弥补人们艰辛生活的一种愉悦而自然的消遣。尽管狂吃滥饮有害无益，然而在我看来，这种特拉普式的养生之道同样不无缺欠。可当我回想起我所见到的人全都容光焕发、精神振奋，就不禁大为惊奇。我想不出还在哪里见过比这里更加快乐、更加健康的人群。事实上，在这片荒凉的高地上，对雪中圣母院劳作不停的修道士们来说，生命是无常的期限，而死神是时常光顾的访客。至少，人们是这样告诉我的。但如果说他们死得很安逸，那么同时他们一定活得非常健康，因为他们看来都身体强健、气色极佳；我可以观察到的唯一病态的迹象，就是亮得不寻常的双眼，而这却更加深了他们给人的活跃、强健的总体印象。","The monks, by special grace of their Abbot, were still taking two meals a day; but it was already time for their grand fast, which begins somewhere in September and lasts till Easter, and during which they eat but once in the twenty-four hours, and that at two in the afternoon, twelve hours after they have begun the toil and vigil of the day. Their meals are scanty, but even of these they eat sparingly; and though each is allowed a small carafe of wine, many refrain from this indulgence. Without doubt, the most of mankind grossly overeat themselves; our meals serve not only for support, but as a hearty and natural diversion from the labour of life. Yet, though excess may be hurtful, I should have thought this Trappist regimen defective. And I am astonished, as I look back, at the freshness of face and cheerfulness of manner of all whom I beheld. A happier nor a healthier company I should scarce suppose that I have ever seen. As a matter of fact, on this bleak upland, and with the incessant occupation of the monks, life is of an uncertain tenure, and death no infrequent visitor, at Our Lady of the Snows. This, at least, was what was told me. But if they die easily, they must live healthily in the meantime, for they seemed all firm of flesh and high in colour; and the only morbid sign that I could observe, an unusual brilliancy of eye, was one that served rather to increase the general impression of vivacity and strength."
"与我交谈过的人态度都极其和悦，我只能称其为神态和谈吐中圣洁的愉悦。在访客指南中，有一条注意事项，告诉他们不要为接待者简略的言辞而恼怒，因为对于修道者来说，沉默寡言是适当的。这条注意事项也许有些多此一举，因为所有负责接待的修士都很健谈，言语毫无恶意，而且，以我对这座修道院的认识，开始一场交谈比打断它要容易得多。除了精通世故的迈克尔神父，其他人都对所有的话题——政治、航行、我的睡袋——都表现得兴致勃勃，而且谈话间毫不吝于说出自己的看法。","Those with whom I spoke were singularly sweet-tempered, with what I can only call a holy cheerfulness in air and conversation. There is a note, in the direction to visitors, telling them not to be offended at the curt speech of those who wait upon them, since it is proper to monks to speak little. The note might have been spared; to a man the hospitallers were all brimming with innocent talk, and, in my experience of the monastery, it was easier to begin than to break off a conversation. With the exception of Father Michael, who was a man of the world, they showed themselves full of kind and healthy interest in all sorts of subjects—in politics, in voyages, in my sleeping-sack—and not without a certain pleasure in the sound of their own voices."
"对于那些严守沉默的人来说，我只能暗自纳闷，他们是如何忍受严肃而阴郁的孤寂的。除了苦修的目的，我还从他们的行为中看到了一种睿智，这种智慧不仅仅在于他们对女性的排斥，还在于他们的沉默戒律。我曾见过一些俗世的类似法伦斯泰尔团体，它们的成员具有艺术家的气质，简直像酒神的信徒那样狂饮作乐；这些成员很容易就聚在一起，却也更加轻易就风流云散了。如果他们也有西多会那样严格的教规的话，他们可能会持续得更久一点。有了女性在近旁，那些不设防的男人结成的就只能是个转瞬即逝的团体，异性间更加强烈的吸引力无疑会大获全胜。只需与之谈上十分钟，孩提时的梦想，青年时的宏愿，就统统被扔诸脑后了；那柔情的眼波，爱抚的声调，立刻把艺术、科学以及由职业带来的属于男性的欢悦，抛到了九霄云外。其次，口舌也是了不得的离间者。","As for those who are restricted to silence, I can only wonder how they bear their solemn and cheerless isolation. And yet, apart from any view of mortification, I can see a certain policy, not only in the exclusion of women, but in this vow of silence. I have had some experience of lay phalansteries, of an artistic, not to say a bacchanalian character; and seen more than one association easily formed and yet more easily dispersed. With a Cistercian rule , perhaps they might have lasted longer. In the neighbourhood of women it is but a touch-and-go association that can be formed among defenceless men; the stronger electricity is sure to triumph; the dreams of boyhood, the schemes of youth, are abandoned after an interview of ten minutes, and the arts and sciences, and professional male jollity, deserted at once for two sweet eyes and a caressing accent. And next after this, the tongue is the great divider."
"要继续从如此世俗的角度去评判宗教教规，让我难免羞愧；但特拉普派的教规中还有一点吸引了我，在我看来它同样是智慧的典范。凌晨两点，钟声开始敲响，此后每一小时敲响一次，有时隔一刻钟就敲响一次，一直到八点才可以休息；一天的时间被割成零碎的小块，每一段时间都有不同的工作要做。比方说那位养兔子的修士，一整天都要匆匆奔波于兔箱、小礼拜堂、牧师会礼堂或食堂之间：每小时他都要进行祷告，或有一项修行的功课需要完成；从两点在黑暗中起床，直到八点回去接受睡眠这一舒适的恩赐，他都是步履匆匆，从事着种种繁杂的劳作。我认识很多人，他们一年有数千的收入，却没有修道士们的好运，能够把生活安排得这样井井有条。修道院的钟声把一天分成易于管理的几部分，它能进入多少家庭，为之带来心灵的宁静以及有益身体健康的活动啊！我们时常谈及生活的艰辛，可真正的艰辛却是成为一个迟钝的傻瓜，用我们枯燥又愚蠢的方式不当地安排我们的生活。","I am almost ashamed to pursue this worldly criticism of a religious rule10; but there is yet another point in which the Trappist order appeals to me as a model of wisdom. By two in the morning the clapper goes upon the bell, and so on, hour by hour, and sometimes quarter by quarter, till eight, the hour of rest; so infinitesimally is the day divided among different occupations. The man who keeps rabbits, for example, hurries from his hutches to the chapel, the chapter-room, or the refectory, all day long: every hour he has an office to sing, a duty to perform; from two, when he rises in the dark, till eight, when he returns to receive the comfortable gift of sleep, he is upon his feet and occupied with manifold and changing business. I know many persons, worth several thousands in the year, who are not so fortunate in the disposal of their lives. Into how many houses would not the note of the monastery bell, dividing the day into manageable portions, bring peace of mind and healthful activity of body! We speak of hardships, but the true hardship is to be a dull fool, and permitted to mismanage life in our own dull and foolish manner. "
"从这一角度来讲，我们可能会更好地理解修道士的生活。在成为正式的修士修女之前，有一个长长的见习期，见习者们需要展示出他们不屈的意志和强健的体魄，但我却很少看到有人因此气馁。修道院的摄影棚在其附属建筑群中，外形显得十分奇特。在那里，我的视线被一位穿着步兵制服的年轻人的肖像吸引住了。他是一位见习修道士，到了服役年龄，于是在阿尔及尔的驻军里服了一段时间的兵役，每日里行军、操练、站岗放哨。在作决定之前，这个人肯定已经看到了生活的两个截然不同的方面，但他一服完兵役，就马上回来完成他的见习。","From this point of view, we may perhaps better understand the monk’s existence. A long novitiate and every proof of constancy of mind and strength of body is required before admission to the order; but I could not find that many were discouraged. In the photographer’s studio, which figures so strangely among the outbuildings, my eye was attracted by the portrait of a young fellow in the uniform of a private of foot. This was one of the novices, who came of the age for service, and marched and drilled and mounted guard for the proper time among the garrison of Algiers. Here was a man who had surely seen both sides of life before deciding; yet as soon as he was set free from service he returned to finish his novitiate."
"严厉的教规赋予了人们进入天堂的权利。即便是生了病，特拉普派的修士也不会中止他的修行。他祈祷并劳作着过完他节俭沉默的一生后，躺在了临终床上；就在解脱者终于来临的那一瞬间，甚至不等他们为他穿上长袍，在持续的诵经声中把他的遗体摆在小礼拜堂里，喜钟就响起来了，就像婚礼时那样，穿过石板砌成的钟塔，向四邻宣告，又一个灵魂飞向上帝的怀抱了。","This austere rule entitles a man to heaven as by right. When the Trappist sickens, he quits not his habit; he lies in the bed of death as he has prayed and laboured in his frugal and silent existence; and when the Liberator comes, at the very moment, even before they have carried him in his robe to lie his little last in the chapel among continual chantings, joy-bells break forth, as if for a marriage, from the slated belfry, and proclaim throughout the neighbourhood that another soul has gone to God."
"晚上，在那位善良的爱尔兰人的引导下，我在楼座里找了一席之地，听人们晚祷，咏唱《圣母经》，这宣告了西多会修士们一天活动的终结。在新教徒看来，这些仪式绝不像罗马天主教会那些公开的仪式那样幼稚而俗丽。仪式极其简朴，因周围环境的渲染显得尤为庄严，有着直触人心的力量。我回忆起那粉刷成白色的小礼拜堂，唱诗班中戴着兜帽的身影，明灭的烛光，雄壮的吟唱，以及随之而来的一片肃静，戴着兜帽的头颅纷纷低下祈祷的情景，其后响起清越的钟声，打断这片肃静，表示最后的仪式已然完成，就寝时间到了。现在我想起当时的情景，我毫不奇怪自己当时会逃入院中，满脑子混乱的幻想，像一个困惑不已的人，吹着冷风站在星空下。","At night, under the conduct of my kind Irishman, I took my place in the gallery to hear compline and Salve Regina, with which the Cistercians bring every day to a conclusion. There were none of those circumstances which strike the Protestant as childish or as tawdry in the public offices of Rome. A stern simplicity, heightened by the romance of the surroundings, spoke directly to the heart. I recall the whitewashed chapel, the hooded figures in the choir, the lights alternately occluded and revealed, the strong manly singing, the silence that ensued, the sight of cowled heads bowed in prayer, and then the clear trenchant beating of the bell, breaking in to show that the last office was over and the hour of sleep had come; and when I remember, I am not surprised that I made my escape into the court with somewhat whirling fancies, and stood like a man bewildered in the windy starry night."
"但是我很疲倦了，那本枯燥的伊丽莎白.西顿传记平静了我的心神，寒气和松林间呼啸的风声（我的房间在修道院紧邻着树林的那一边）让我很快沉沉入睡。我在黑夜里被第一阵钟声唤醒了，当时似乎还是午夜，但实际上已经凌晨两点了。所有的修士都匆匆奔进小礼拜堂；这些活死人们，在这样一个绝早的时刻，已经开始了一天的辛苦劳碌。这些活死人们——我沉思着，一股寒意涌上心头。这时我记起了一首法国歌谣，唱出了我们男女同处世间的美妙：","But I was weary; and when I had quieted my spirits with Elizabeth Seton’s memoirs—a dull work—the cold and the raving of the wind among the pines (for my room was on that side of the monastery which adjoins the woods) disposed me readily to slumber. I was wakened at black midnight, as it seemed, though it was really two in the morning, by the first stroke upon the bell. All the brothers were then hurrying to the chapel; the dead in life, at this untimely hour, were already beginning the uncomforted labours of their day. The dead in life—there was a chill reflection. And the words of a French song came back into my memory, telling of the best of our mixed existence: "
"“你有几位美貌的女儿啊，","“Que t’as de belles filles,"
"吉罗弗莱！","Giroflé! "
"吉罗弗拉！","Girofla! "
"你有几位美貌的女儿啊，","Que t’as de belles filles, "
"爱会把她们一一点数！”","L’amour let comptera!” "
"我感谢上帝，让我可以自由地漫步，自由地希望，自由地去爱。","And I blessed God that I was free to wander, free to hope, and free to love."
"8.寄宿者","VIII. The Boarders"
"但是我在雪中圣母院的生活还有另外一面。时至季末，修道院里没有多少寄宿者；但它的公共区域却也不单我一人。这儿离大门很近，一楼有一个小小的食堂，楼上走廊两侧全是跟我住的类似的小房间。我蠢得忘掉了长期隐居者的膳食费用，但大概是三到五法郎一天，我想很有可能是前者。像我这样偶尔一至的访客可以用自愿捐款的形式随意交一些费用，但绝不强求。值得一提的是，我要离开的时候，迈克尔神父谢绝了我的二十法郎，说那太多了。我向他解释了我给他如此之多的原因，但即使是那样，出于一种奇特的荣誉心，他也不愿亲手接受这笔钱。“我无权替修道院拒绝，”他解释说，“但我更希望你把它交给其中一位修士。”","But there was another side to my residence at Our Lady of the Snows. At this late season there were not many boarders; and yet I was not alone in the public part of the monastery. This itself is hard by the gate, with a small dining-room on the ground-floor and a whole corridor of cells similar to mine upstairs. I have stupidly forgotten the board for a regular retraitant; but it was somewhere between three and five francs a day, and I think most probably the first. Chance visitors like myself might give what they chose as a free-will offering, but nothing was demanded. I may mention that when I was going away, Father Michael refused twenty francs as excessive. I explained the reasoning which led me to offer him so much; but even then, from a curious point of honour, he would not accept it with his own hand. “I have no right to refuse for the monastery,” he explained, “but I should prefer if you would give it to one of the brothers.”"
"因为到得太迟，所以我独自一人用餐。但晚餐时我看到了另外两位客人。一位是乡村教区教士，他是那天上午从芒德附近他的任职地一路步行而来的，想在此度过幽居祷告的四天。他身材魁梧，肤色健康，脸上刻着一道道皱纹，像个庄稼汉；他对一路上绊手绊脚的长袍下摆大加抱怨时，我脑海中不禁浮现出一幅他栩栩如生的形象：昂首挺胸，骨骼粗大，卷起了长袍下摆，大步走在热沃当的荒山秃岭之中。另外一位头发灰白，矮壮结实，大概四十五到五十岁，穿着粗花呢外套，针织短上衣，纽扣眼上系着装饰用的红色缎带。很难把第二位客人归入哪一类人。他是位退伍军人，曾经服过兵役，并晋升至当地部队驻地指挥官，现在仍保留着军队中某些干脆斩截的气质。另一方面，他的辞呈一被接受，他就来到雪中圣母院寄宿，然后，短暂地体验了其中的生活后，他决定留在此地做一名见习修士。这种新的生活已经开始改变他的形象；他已或多或少拥有了修士们安详和悦的神态；现在他既不是一名军官，也不是特拉普派的修道士，而是兼具二者的特点。显然这是一位正处于人生中有趣而又关键的时刻的男人。他自嘈杂的炮声军号声中出来，正走向这仿佛墓地的僻静乡野，这儿的人们晚上穿着寿衣入睡，而且，像幽灵一样，用手势进行交流。","I had dined alone, because I arrived late; but at supper I found two other guests. One was a country parish priest, who had walked over that morning from the seat of his cure near Mende to enjoy four days of solitude and prayer. He was a grenadier in person, with the hale colour and circular wrinkles of a peasant; and as he complained much of how he had been impeded by his skirts upon the march, I have a vivid fancy portrait of him, striding along, upright, big-boned, with kilted cassock, through the bleak hills of Gévaudan. The other was a short, grizzling, thick-set man, from forty-five to fifty, dressed in tweed with a knitted spencer, and the red ribbon of a decoration in his button-hole. This last was a hard person to classify. He was an old soldier, who had seen service and risen to the rank of commandant; and he retained some of the brisk decisive manners of the camp. On the other hand, as soon as his resignation was accepted, he had come to Our Lady of the Snows as a boarder, and, after a brief experience of its ways, had decided to remain as a novice. Already the new life was beginning to modify his appearance; already he had acquired somewhat of the quiet and smiling air of the brethren; and he was as yet neither an officer nor a Trappist, but partook of the character of each. And certainly here was a man in an interesting nick of life. Out of the noise of cannon and trumpets, he was in the act of passing into this still country bordering on the grave, where men sleep nightly in their grave-clothes, and, like phantoms, communicate by signs."
"晚餐时我们聊起了政治。在法国时，我以宣扬政治上的亲善和温和为己任，还以波兰为例高谈阔论，很像英国一些杞人忧天的人谈论迦太基。牧师和指挥官都向我保证他们和我的意见完全一致，同时对现在人们之间深深的敌意深为叹息。","At supper we talked politics. I make it my business, when I am in France, to preach political good-will and moderation, and to dwell on the example of Poland, much as some alarmists in England dwell on the example of Carthage1. The priest and the commandant assured me of their sympathy with all I said, and made a heavy sighing over the bitterness of contemporary feeling. "
"“唉，你无法和一个人就他完全不赞同的事情说上一句话，”我说，“否则他就会对你大发雷霆。”","“Why, you cannot say anything to a man with which he does not absolutely agree,” said I, “but he flies up at you in a temper.” "
"他们都宣称，这种情况是违背基督精神的。","They both declared that such a state of things was antichristian. "
"我们聊得正投机，无意间我称赞了甘必大所持的温和立场。这位老军人的脸立刻涨得血红，他像个淘气的孩子一样用手掌敲打着桌面。","While we were thus agreeing, what should my tongue stumble upon but a word in praise of Gambetta’s2 moderation. The old soldier’s countenance was instantly suffused with blood; with the palms of his hands he beat the table like a naughty child. "
"“怎么回事，先生？”他大叫，“怎么回事？甘必大温和？你敢证明你的话吗？”","“Comment, Monsieur?” he shouted. “Comment? Gambetta moderate? Will you dare to justify these words?” "
"但是牧师还没有忘记我们谈话的主题。正当怒气勃发之际，老军人突然在牧师的脸上看到了警告的神色，他立刻意识到自己举止的荒唐之处，咆哮嘎然而止，我们都没有再发一言。","But the priest had not forgotten the tenor of our talk. And suddenly, in the height of his fury, the old soldier found a warning look directed on his face; the absurdity of his behaviour was brought home to him in a flash; and the storm came to an abrupt end, without another word. "
"直到次日早晨喝咖啡的时候（9月27日，礼拜五），这两个人才发现我是个异教徒。我猜是我对这里修道生活的一些赞赏之言误导了他们；直到我问出一个直率的问题，他们才发现了事实真相。天真率性的阿波利纳里斯神父和老于世故的迈克尔神父都宽容地对待我；而那位好心的爱尔兰副主祭，在听到我的宗教倾向后，只是拍拍我的肩膀，说：“你应该成为一名天主教徒，然后进入天堂。”但当时我属于正统教的另一个派系。这二人苛刻、正派而又狭隘，就像最糟的苏格兰人那样，甚至，在我心里，我把他们想得更坏。牧师像战马一样响亮地哼着鼻子。","It was only in the morning, over our coffee (Friday, September 27th), that this couple found out I was a heretic. I suppose I had misled them by some admiring expressions as to the monastic life around us; and it was only by a point-blank question that the truth came out. I had been tolerantly used both by simple Father Apollinaris and astute Father Michael; and the good Irish deacon, when he heard of my religious weakness, had only patted me upon the shoulder and said, “You must be a Catholic and come to heaven.” But I was now among a different sect of orthodox. These two men were bitter and upright and narrow, like the worst of Scotsmen, and indeed, upon my heart, I fancy they were worse. The priest snorted aloud like a battle-horse. "
"“那你是打算到死都坚持那种信仰吗？”他责问我；世间没有一个排版工人能有足够大的字体可以标出他的语气。","“Et vous prétendez mourir dans cette espèce de croyance?” he demanded; and there is no type used by mortal printers large enough to qualify his accent. "
"我谦逊地表示我还没有想过要改变信仰。","I humbly indicated that I had no design of changing. "
"但他却无法姑息这样一种可怕的态度。“不，不，”他大声喊道，“你必须改变。你已经来到了这儿，上帝把你引领到这里，你就必须抓住这个机会。”","But he could not away with such a monstrous attitude. “No, no,” he cried; “you must change. You have come here, God has led you here, and you must embrace the opportunity.” "
"我不慎在策略上犯了一个错误；我提到了家庭感情问题，但是我是在对一位牧师和一位军人说话，这两类人受环境所限，远离了生活中友爱和家庭的联系。","I made a slip in policy; I appealed to the family affections, though I was speaking to a priest and a soldier, two classes of men circumstantially divorced from the kind and homely ties of life."
"“你的父母？”牧师喊道。“很好；回到家后你可以让他们也皈依天主教。”","“Your father and mother?” cried the priest. “Very well; you will convert them in their turn when you go home.” "
"我想我看到了父亲的脸！我宁愿去捉洞穴里的加图利亚狮子，也不愿冒险跟我们的家庭神学家作对。","I think I see my father’s face! I would rather tackle the Gaetulian lion3 in his den than embark on such an enterprise against the family theologian. "
"但此刻的猎捕活动正在兴头儿上。牧师和军人高呼要我改变信仰；而谢拉尔人民在1877年为之捐献了四十八法郎十生丁的“信仰传播事业”，被坚定地实施在我的身上。他们让我改变宗教信仰的方式古怪却非常有效。他们从不试图用道理说服我，如果这样的话我还可以试着为自己辩护一下，而是理所当然地认为，我对自己的立场是既羞愧又恐惧的，于是完全从时机的角度对我进行规劝。现在，他们说，上帝让我来到了雪中圣母院，现在正是上帝指定的时间。","But now the hunt was up; priest and soldier were in full cry for my conversion; and the Work of the Propagation of the Faith, for which the people of Cheylard subscribed forty-eight francs ten centimes during 1877, was being gallantly pursued against myself. It was an odd but most effective proselytising. They never sought to convince me in argument, where I might have attempted some defence; but took it for granted that I was both ashamed and terrified at my position, and urged me solely on the point of time. Now, they said, when God had led me to Our Lady of the Snows, now was the appointed hour. "
"“不要为了虚无的羞耻心而退缩呀，”牧师如此鼓励我。","“Do not be withheld by false shame,” observed the priest, for my encouragement. "
"对于一位感到所有教派都无甚差别的人，一个从来不能、甚至一刻也不能从事物永恒的层面上认真衡量这种或那种教义的优点的人，无论他可能会在那些世俗的短暂的方面发现多少值得赞扬或谴责的地方，现在的这种情形是不公而又痛苦的。我在策略上犯了第二个错误，辩解说，最终的结果都是一样的，我们都沿着不同的道路一步步接近同一位仁慈而公正的朋友和天父。这一点，在世俗的心灵看来，是唯一真正的福音。然而，不同的人见地自然也不相同；这种革命性的愿望把牧师吓坏了，他想到了戒律的各种可怕，于是开始讲述地狱里各种悲惨的细节。他根据不到一星期前才读过的一本书说道，那些被罚入地狱的灵魂和我持有同样的态度，而他们将永世在痛苦中煎熬。那本小书，为了可信再可信，他已决意随身带在口袋里。他这样详加阐述时，神色在对宗教的热情中显得更加高贵了。","For one who feels very similarly to all sects of religion, and who has never been able, even for a moment, to weigh seriously the merit of this or that creed on the eternal side of things, however much he may see to praise or blame upon the secular and temporal side, the situation thus created was both unfair and painful. I committed my second fault in tact, and tried to plead that it was all the same thing in the end, and we were all drawing near by different sides to the same kind and undiscriminating Friend and Father. That, as it seems to lay spirits, would be the only gospel worthy of the name. But different men think differently; and this revolutionary aspiration brought down the priest with all the terrors of the law. He launched into harrowing details of hell. The damned, he said—on the authority of a little book which he had read not a week before, and which, to add conviction to conviction, he had fully intended to bring along with him in his pocket—were to occupy the same attitude through all eternity in the midst of dismal tortures. And as he thus expatiated, he grew in nobility of aspect with his enthusiasm."
"结果这二人得出结论，既然院长不在，我应该去找副院长，把我的情况立刻报告给他。","As a result the pair concluded that I should seek out the Prior, since the Abbot was from home, and lay my case immediately before him."
"“这是我作为一名退伍军人的忠告，”指挥官说，“也是这位先生作为牧师的忠告。”","“C’est mon conseil comme ancien militaire,” obser ved the commandant; “Et celui de Monsieur comme prêtre.” "
"“是的，”教区牧师接道，郑重其事地点了点头，“作为一名退伍军人和一名牧师。”","“Oui, ” added the cure, sententiously nodding; “Comme ancien militaire—et comme prêtre.” "
"我正有些尴尬，不知如何作答，这时，进来了一位修道士。这是一位穿着褐色长袍的小个子，像蟋蟀一样活泼，带着意大利口音，他立刻就加入了争论，但语气更加温和，更加令人信服，正符合这些举止文雅的修士的态度。看看他，他说道。这里的戒律非常严格，他内心更4愿意留在他的祖国，意大利——大家都知道那里有多么美丽，美丽的意大利；但是那时意大利没有特拉普派的修道院；而他要拯救自己的灵魂，所以就来到这里了。","At this moment, whilst I was somewhat embarrassed how to answer, in came one of the monks, a little brown fellow, as lively as a grig, and with an Italian accent, who threw himself at once into the contention, but in a milder and more persuasive vein, as befitted one of these pleasant brethren. Look at him, he said. The rule was very hard; he would have dearly liked to stay in his own country, Italy—it was well known how beautiful it was, the beautiful Italy; but then there were no Trappists in Italy; and he had a soul to save; and here he was. "
"恐怕我本质上是个，像一位快活的印度批评家称呼我的那样，“轻佻的享乐主义者，”因为那位修士对自己动机的描述让我有些震惊。我本应该认为，他是因为喜欢才选择这样的生活，而不是为了什么其他隐晦的目的；这证明了我和那些善良的特拉普派修道士在本质上是多么不同，即使我正尽力争取向他们靠近。但对于牧师来说，这个理由似乎是决定性的。","I am afraid I must be at bottom, what a cheerful Indian critic has dubbed me, “a faddling hedonist,” for this description of the brother’s motives gave me somewhat of a shock. I should have preferred to think he had chosen the life for its own sake, and not for ulterior purposes; and this shows how profoundly I was out of sympathy with these good Trappists, even when I was doing my best to sympathise. But to the curé the argument seemed decisive. "
"“听听这个吧！”他叫道。“我在此遇到过一位侯爵，一位侯爵，一位侯爵”——他把这个高贵的字眼重复了三遍——“还有其他地位很高的人；还有几位将军。还有这里，你身边的这位先生，他曾经服役多年——授过勋，一位年事已高的战士。他就在这里，准备把自己奉献给上帝。”","“Hear that!” he cried. “And I have seen a marquis here, a marquis, a marquis”—he repeated the holy word three times over—“and other persons high in society; and generals. And here, at your side, is this gentleman, who has been so many years in armies—decorated an old warrior. And here he is, ready to dedicate himself to God.” "
"此刻我深感惭愧，于是以双脚很冷为借口，逃出了房间。这是个狂风怒号的清晨，天色十分晴朗，强烈的阳光长时间地闪耀着；直到午饭前我都在野地里往东游荡，大风吹得我踉踉跄跄，但作为此行的回报，我也得以饱览了许多迷人的风景。","I was by this time so thoroughly embarrassed that I pled cold feet, and made my escape from the apartment. It was a furious windy morning, with a sky much cleared, and long and potent intervals of sunshine; and I wandered until dinner in the wild country towards the east, sorely staggered and beaten upon by the gale, but rewarded with some striking views. "
"午饭时，“信仰传播事业”又开始了，而且这次更加令我不快。就他眼中我父亲可鄙的信仰，牧师向我问了很多问题，又对我的回答报以牧师们特有的吃吃傻笑。","At dinner the Work of the Propagation of the Faith was recommenced, and on this occasion still more distastefully to me. The priest asked me many questions as to the contemptible faith of my fathers, and received my replies with a kind of ecclesiastical titter. "
"“你们的教派，”他有次说道，“我认为你也会承认，把它称之为宗教，实在是太抬举它了。”","“Your sect,” he said once; “for I think you will admit it would be doing it too much honour to call it a religion.”"
"“随你高兴吧，先生，”我说，“这是你的看法。”","“As you please, monsieur,” said I. “La parole est à vous.” "
"我终于被烦扰得忍无可忍；尽管他有自己的理由，而且更重要的是，他是一位老人，因此有理由得到我的容忍，我还是忍不住抗议这种不文明的相处方式。他听过后感到悲哀又窘迫。","At length I grew annoyed beyond endurance; and although he was on his own ground and, what is more to the purpose, an old man, and so holding a claim upon my toleration, I could not avoid a protest against this uncivil usage. He was sadly discountenanced. "
"“我向你保证。”他说，“我内心无意嘲笑你们。我只是关心你的灵魂，别无他意。”","“I assure you.” he said, “I have no inclination to laugh in my heart. I have no other feeling but interest in your soul.” "
"我的改宗到此也告一段落。多么真诚的人啊！他并不是危险的欺骗者，而是一个乡下牧师，满怀宗教热忱和信念。愿他能长久地穿着卷起下摆的长袍行走在热沃当的山路上！他身体强健，足以应付行路；又意志坚强，足以安慰垂死的教区居民。我敢说当他的职责召唤他时，他一定会英勇地在暴风雪中跋涉前进；最虔诚的信徒并不总是最灵活的传道者。","And there ended my conversion. Honest man! he was no dangerous deceiver; but a country parson, full of zeal and faith. Long may he tread Gévaudan with his kilted skirts—a man strong to walk and strong to comfort his parishioners in death! I daresay he would beat bravely through a snowstorm where his duty called him; and it is not always the most faithful believer who makes the cunningest apostle."

"9.跨越古莱山","IX. Across The Goulet"
"午饭时风小了，但天色仍很清朗，因此当我在修道院门前把行李装到小乖背上时，兆头比上次出发时好多了。我的爱尔兰朋友陪我走了很长一段路。我们穿过树林的时候，阿波利纳里斯神父正在那儿用力拖着他的手推车；他也停下来，陪我走了大概一百码的路程，双手紧紧地把我的手握在胸前。我与他们先后分手时，不免黯然神伤，但同时也难掩身为旅行者雀跃的心情，因为终于要抖落前段路程的征尘，向下一个目标进发了。小乖和我沿着阿列河溯游而上，这条河把我们带回热沃当，通向它在梅尔夸森林中的源头。我们离开它的引导之前，它已成了一条不起眼的小溪流。后来，我们翻过一座山，在一片寸草不生的高地中寻路前行，终于在日暮时分来到了夏塞拉代。","The wind fell during dinner, and the sky remained clear; so it was under better auspices that I loaded Modestine before the monastery gate. My Irish friend accompanied me so far on the way. As we came through the wood, there was Père Apollinaire hauling his barrow; and he too quitted his labours to go with me for perhaps a hundred yards, holding my hand between both of his in front of him. I parted first from one and then from the other with unfeigned regret, but yet with the glee of the traveller who shakes off the dust of one stage before hurrying forth upon another. Then Modestine and I mounted the course of the Allier, which here led us back into Gévaudan towards its sources in the forest of Mercoire. It was but an inconsiderable burn before we left its guidance. Thence, over a hill, our way lay through a naked plateau, until we reached Chasseradès at sundown. "
"那天晚上，聚在旅馆厨房里的人都是为计划修建的铁路进行勘察而来的。他们聪明又健谈，我们一边喝着烈酒，一边纵谈法国的未来，直到钟表的指针让我们大吃一惊，便赶紧去休息了。楼上的小房间里有四张床，上面睡了我们六个人。我一个人睡了一整张床，还劝他们开着窗户。","The company in the inn kitchen that night were all men employed in survey for one of the projected railways. They were intelligent and conversible, and we decided the future of France over hot wine, until the state of the clock frightened us to rest. There were four beds in the little upstairs room; and we slept six. But I had a bed to myself, and persuaded them to leave the window open. "
"“嘿，城里人，五点钟了！”清晨（9月28日，礼拜六）的喊声让我从睡梦中醒来。卧室沉浸在一片透明的黑暗中，我隐隐约约看到另外三张床，还有枕上五个不同的睡帽。但窗外山巅上那长长的一抹微红的晨光正越来越浓，曙光即将洒遍这片高地。这是令人心情振奋的时刻；看起来今天不会再有大风了，我的预测随后完全得到了证实。我和小乖立刻就上路了。我们在高地上走了一段，然后道路下斜，经过一个地势险峻的村落，来到了沙斯扎克河谷。这条小河流淌在茵茵绿草之间，陡峭的河岸把它很好地隐藏在尘世之外。金雀花正在盛开，随处可见村落里袅袅上升的炊烟。","“Hé, bourgeois; il est cinq heures!” was the cry that wakened me in the morning (Saturday, September 28th). The room was full of a transparent darkness, which dimly showed me the other three beds and the five different nightcaps on the pillows. But out of the window the dawn was growing ruddy in a long belt over the hill-tops, and day was about to flood the plateau. The hour was inspiriting; and there seemed a promise of calm weather, which was perfectly fulfilled. I was soon under way with Modestine. The road lay for a while over the plateau, and then descended through a precipitous village into the valley of the Chassezac. This stream ran among green meadows, well hidden from the world by its steep banks; the broom was in flower, and here and there was a hamlet sending up its smoke. "
"最后我们从一座桥上跨过沙斯扎克河，然后把这个深谷抛在身后，开始翻越古莱山。山路蜿蜒而上，途径莱唐佩镇，两边是高地上的块块农田和片片山毛榉林和白桦林，每转过一个弯，就会有一些新鲜的景致映入我的眼帘。还在沙斯扎克河谷的时候，我就听到一阵响声，仿佛低沉的钟声，从数英里外远远传来；但就当我继续攀山而上，离它越来越近的时候，这声音似乎变了，我最终发现它来自于一个乡下的号角，牧羊人吹着它赶羊到田野去。莱唐佩窄窄的街道上全是羊，挤得满满的，黑的白的，都在咩咩叫着，好像春日里唧啾乱鸣的鸟群，每只羊脖子上还挂着铃铛为它们伴奏。这些声音汇成了一场蹩脚的音乐会，全是刺耳的高音。又往上走了一段，我看到两个人站在树上，手里拿着修枝剪，其中一个嘴里还哼唱着布雷舞曲。继续向上爬，我在白桦林中绕来绕去的时候，公鸡此起彼伏的啼叫声欢快地响了起来，随之响起的还有高地上某个村庄传来的长笛声，吹奏着从容哀婉的乐曲。我脑海中勾勒出一位头发花白、脸颊红润的乡村教师，坐在他小小的花园里，在秋日的晴空下吹奏着他的长笛。所有这些动听美妙的声音让我的心里充满了非同寻常的期待，仿佛一旦翻越了正在爬的这座山，我将进入一个人间乐园。我没有失望，因为现在我已经逃出了凄风苦雨还有荒凉的乡野。我旅行的第一部分在这里结束了；这些乐声仿佛一支甜美的序曲，把我引领至另一段更加美好的旅程。","At last the path crossed the Chassezac upon a bridge, and, forsaking this deep hollow, set itself to cross the mountain of La Goulet. It wound up through Lestampes by upland fields and woods of beech and birch, and with every corner brought me into an acquaintance with some new interest. Even in the gully of the Chassezac my ear had been struck by a noise like that of a great bass bell ringing at the distance of many miles; but this, as I continued to mount and draw nearer to it, seemed to change in character, and I found at length that it came from some one leading flocks afield to the note of a rural horn. The narrow street of Lestampes stood full of sheep, from wall to wall—black sheep and white, bleating with one accord like the birds in spring, and each one accompanying himself upon the sheep-bell round his neck. It made a pathetic concert, all in treble. A little higher, and I passed a pair of men in a tree with pruning-hooks, and one of them was singing the music of a bourrée1. Still further, and when I was already threading the birches, the crowing of cocks came cheerfully up to my ears, and along with that the voice of a flute discoursing a deliberate and plaintive air from one of the upland villages. I pictured to myself some grizzled, apple-cheeked, country schoolmaster fluting in his bit of a garden in the clear autumn sunshine. All these beautiful and interesting sounds filled my heart with an unwonted expectation; and it appeared to me that, once past this range which I was mounting, I should descend into the garden of the world. Nor was I deceived, for I was now done with rains and winds and a bleak country. The first part of my journey ended here; and this was like an induction of sweet sounds into the other and more beautiful. "
"除去美好的一面，也有种种不如意之处，仿佛对我的惩罚。现在我的好兴致就把我带入了一场冒险。为着以后的赶驴人着想，我还是把我的经历讲一下吧。山坡上的道路太过迂回曲折，所以我就靠着地图和罗盘，选了一条捷径，打算穿过一片矮林，在山势较高处再走回正路。这是我和小乖之间的一次严重冲突。她完全不理会我的捷径，当着我的面转过身子；她向后退，用后腿立着；我本以为她是个哑巴，这次却大声而刺耳地嘶鸣着，好像一只报晓的公鸡。我一只手挥舞着刺棒，另一只手因为山势太过陡峭，只好扶着驮鞍。大概有五六次，她因为后退几乎压在我头顶上；还有五六次，我因为筋疲力尽几乎想要放弃，把她重新领回下面去走原来的山路。但我还是想赌上一把，最后总算是赢了。我重新回到路上后，发觉有冰冷的雨滴落到我手上，奇怪极了，我不止一次纳闷地抬头看看没有一丝云彩的晴空。而那只是从我额头滴落的汗水。","There are other degrees of feyness, as of punishment, besides the capital; and I was now led by my good spirits into an adventure which I relate in the interest of future donkey-drivers. The road zigzagged so widely on the hillside, that I chose a short cut by map and compass, and struck through the dwarf woods to catch the road again upon a higher level. It was my one serious conflict with Modestine. She would none of my short cut; she turned in my face; she backed, she reared; she, whom I had hitherto imagined to be dumb, actually brayed with a loud hoarse flourish, like a cock crowing for the dawn. I plied the goad with one hand; with the other, so steep was the ascent, I had to hold on the pack-saddle. Half-a-dozen times she was nearly over backwards on the top of me; half-a-dozen times, from sheer weariness of spirit, I was nearly giving it up, and leading her down again to follow the road. But I took the thing as a wager, and fought it through. I was surprised, as I went on my way again, by what appeared to be chill rain-drops falling on my hand, and more than once looked up in wonder at the cloudless sky. But it was only sweat which came dropping from my brow. "
"在古莱山顶上没有明显的道路，只有耸立的石块散布在四处为行人指示着方向。脚下的草地土质松软，清芬可人。除去一两只云雀，我没有其他同行者。从莱唐佩到布莱马尔的途中我也只遇到了一辆牛车。在我面前是一个浅浅的山谷，山谷之上是洛泽尔山脉，草木稀疏，侧面看非常优美，但整体轮廓却呆板无趣。这里没有什么耕种过的痕迹；只是在布莱马尔附近，有一条从维勒福尔到芒德的白色公路横贯一片草地，两旁种着细长的白杨树，路边回响着一群群牛羊的铃铛声。","Over the summit of the Goulet there was no marked road—only upright stones posted from space to space to guide the drovers. The turf underfoot was springy and well scented. I had no company but a lark or two, and met but one bullock-cart between Lestampes and Bleymard. In front of me I saw a shallow valley, and beyond that the range of the Lozère, sparsely wooded and well enough modelled in the flanks, but straight and dull in outline. There was scarce a sign of culture; only about Bleymard, the white high-road from Villefort to Mende traversed a range of meadows, set with spiry poplars, and sounding from side to side with the bells of flocks and herds."
"10.松林之夜","X. A Night Among The Pines "
"吃过饭后，尽管天色已经不早了，我还是从布莱马尔出发，爬了一段洛泽尔山。一条形迹不明显的石凿小径引我向前；我遇到大概五六辆牛车从高处的树林中下来，每辆车都载着一整棵松树，充作冬天的柴火。在这寒冷的山梁上，松林没有向上延伸到很高的地方。在林子高处，我顺着林间小道向左走，直到偶然间发现一个葱茏幽谷，一道清溪自几块碎石间涌出，形成一个小小水柱，刚好给我当作水龙头。“在更神圣、更幽僻的居处，……没有水泽女神，也没有牧神出现。”这些松树并不老，但却围着林中空地长得郁郁葱葱：大树把视线遮得严严实实，人们只能看得到东北方向远山的山峰，或者是头顶正上方的天空；我的露营地好像房间一样隐秘安全。我打点好一切，又喂了小乖后，夕阳已经西斜。我把膝盖以下都埋进睡袋，又美美地吃了一顿；太阳一下山，我就拉下睡帽盖住眼睛，进入了梦乡。","From Bleymard after dinner, although it was already late, I set out to scale a portion of the Lozère. An ill-marked stony drove-road guided me forward; and I met nearly half-a-dozen bullock-carts descending from the woods, each laden with a whole pine-tree for the winter’s firing. At the top of the woods, which do not climb very high upon this cold ridge, I struck leftward by a path among the pines, until I hit on a dell of green turf, where a streamlet made a little spout over some stones to serve me for a water-tap. “In a more sacred or sequestered bower…nor nymph nor faunus haunted.”1 The trees were not old, but they grew thickly round the glade: there was no outlook, except north-eastward upon distant hill-tops, or straight upward to the sky; and the encampment felt secure and private like a room. By the time I had made my arrangements and fed Modestine, the day was already beginning to decline. I buckled myself to the knees into my sack and made a hearty meal; and as soon as the sun went down, I pulled my cap over my eyes and fell asleep. "
"在屋檐下，晚上是极单调的一段时间，而在野外，夜晚轻柔且带着繁星、露珠和清香，时间是由自然景色的变化来标记的。那对于困在四壁和窗帘之间的人来说似乎是暂时死亡的事，对于睡在旷野之中的人来说，却只是轻浅生动的安眠。他可以整晚倾听大自然深沉自由的呼吸；大自然即使在休憩的时候，也在辗转、微笑；在这里，有一个生机盎然的时刻，是住在室内的人无从得知的。当一丝清醒的力量从沉睡的疆域走过，所有野外的世界就都苏醒过来了。那时雄鸡发出第一声啼叫，并不是为了宣告黎明的到来，而是像一个快活的巡夜人催促黑夜快快过去。草地上的牛群也醒来了；羊群开始进食，在沾满露珠的山坡上啃上几口草，又在那些蕨类植物中换了一个地方重新安卧；那些没有栖身之所、与鸟儿同宿的人们，睁开他们惺忪的睡眼，欣赏夜色的美丽。","Night is a dead monotonous period under a roof; but in the open world it passes lightly, with its stars and dews and perfumes, and the hours are marked by changes in the face of Nature. What seems a kind of temporal death to people choked between walls and curtains, is only a light and living slumber to the man who sleeps afield. All night long he can hear Nature breathing deeply and freely; even as she takes her rest, she turns and smiles; and there is one stirring hour unknown to those who dwell in houses, when a wakeful influence goes abroad over the sleeping hemisphere, and all the outdoor world are on their feet. It is then that the cock first crows, not this time to announce the dawn, but like a cheerful watchman speeding the course of night. Cattle awake on the meadows; sheep break their fast on dewy hillsides, and change to a new lair among the ferns; and houseless men, who have lain down with the fowls, open their dim eyes and behold the beauty of the night. "
"是怎样无声的召唤，或大自然如何温柔的碰触，让这些沉睡者同时苏醒了过来？是夜星洒下的魔力，还是我们都感觉到了沉睡的身躯下大地母亲的阵阵颤抖？即使是最了解这些神秘之处的牧羊人和乡下老农，也猜不透这种夜间复苏的方式和目的。他们承认它发生在凌晨两点，但是却不懂为何如此，也从未深究。但至少这是一件美好的事情。我们仅在睡眠中被打断，就像那位词藻优美的蒙田所说：“我们或许能够更真切、更细致地享受它。”我们有了片刻时间可以仰望星空。对于某些心灵来说，想到我们同周围一切的野外生物感受到同样的生命力，想到我们逃出了文明的巴士底狱，暂时只做一只温顺的动物，一只大自然羊群中的羔羊，就会感到某种独特的乐趣。","At what inaudible summons, at what gentle touch of Nature, are all these sleepers thus recalled in the same hour to life? Do the stars rain down an influence, or do we share some thrill of mother earth below our resting bodies? Even shepherds and old country-folk, who are the deepest read in these arcana, have not a guess as to the means or purpose of this nightly resurrection. Towards two in the morning they declare the thing takes place; and neither know nor inquire further. And at least it is a pleasant incident. We are disturbed in our slumber only, like the luxurious Montaigne2, “that we may the better and more sensibly relish it.” We have a moment to look upon the stars. And there is a special pleasure for some minds in the reflection that we share the impulse with all outdoor creatures in our neighbourhood, that we have escaped out of the Bastille of civilisation, and are become, for the time being, a mere kindly animal and a sheep of Nature’s flock. "
"当那一刻在林间来临，我醒来，感到口渴难耐。罐子就放在我旁边，里面盛了一半的水。我把水一口气喝光；腹内的清凉让我完全醒了过来，于是就坐起来，点了一支烟。夜星宝石似地光亮璀璨，但并不清冷。一带模糊的银色雾气，那是银河。在我四周是黑色的冷杉树冠，笔直挺立，纹丝不动。在白色驮鞍的映衬下，我看到小乖在缰绳允许的范围内一圈圈转着；我可以听到她不停地大声咀嚼着地上的青草；但除了溪流流过石块发出的无可名状的细碎声响，再没有其他声音了。我抽着烟，懒散地躺着，研究着天空的颜色。天空，我们是这样称呼那片虚旷的空间的。在这边的松树后面，天空呈现一片泛红的灰色；那边的群星之间，则是光润的蓝黑色。好像是为了让自己更像一名小贩，我戴了一枚银戒指。当举起或放下雪茄的时候，就看到它闪着微弱的光芒；每吸一口香烟，我的手中就亮一下，并且瞬间成了这片景色中最亮的一点。","When that hour came to me among the pines, I wakened thirsty. My tin was standing by me half full of water. I emptied it at a draught; and feeling broad awake after this internal cold aspersion, sat upright to make a cigarette. The stars were clear, coloured, and jewel-like, but not frosty. A faint silvery vapour stood for the Milky Way. All around me the black fir-points stood upright and stock-still. By the whiteness of the pack-saddle, I could see Modestine walking round and round at the length of her tether; I could hear her steadily munching at the sward; but there was not another sound, save the indescribable quiet talk of the runnel over the stones. I lay lazily smoking and studying the colour of the sky, as we call the void of space, from where it showed a reddish grey behind the pines to where it showed a glossy blue-black between the stars. As if to be more like a pedlar, I wear a silver ring. This I could see faintly shining as I raised or lowered the cigarette; and at each whiff the inside of my hand was illuminated, and became for a second the highest light in the landscape."
"柔风不时吹过林间空地，与其说那是空气的流动，倒更像是飘过的一阵凉意。因此，即使是在我舒适的睡卧里，整晚空气也在不停流动更新。我憎恶地回忆起夏塞拉代的旅馆和那许多凑在一起的睡帽；回忆起那些职员和学生们夜间的破坏力，还有闷热的剧院、万能钥匙和紧闭的房间。我很少感到现在这样的安详宁静，也很少像这样独立于物质支撑之外。我们常常逃开外面的自然界，退缩进我们的房屋中去，然而大自然看起来终究还是一个柔和的宜居之地。夜复一夜，似乎一张床已安放在野外，在上帝建造的开阔的房间内，等待人的到来。我认为自己重新发现了一条真理，是那些为野蛮人所知，然而政治经济学家们却从不知晓的真理中的一条——最起码，我为自己找到了一种新的乐趣。但虽然我为自己的独处欣然自得，却仍然感到一种奇怪的缺憾。我希望身边有位同伴和我一起躺在星光下，不说、不动，但却随时可以碰触得到。因为有种情谊甚至比独处更让人感到内心恬静，确切地说，这是独处至善至美之境界。男人与心爱的女人共同生活在户外，才是最圆满、最无拘无束的生活方式。","A faint wind, more like a moving coolness than a stream of air, passed down the glade from time to time; so that even in my great chamber the air was being renewed all night long. I thought with horror of the inn at Chasseradès and the congregated nightcaps; with horror of the nocturnal prowesses of clerks and students, of hot theatres and pass- keys and close rooms. I have not often enjoyed a more serene possession of myself, nor felt more independent of material aids. The outer world, from which we cower into our houses, seemed after all a gentle habitable place; and night after night a man’s bed, it seemed, was laid and waiting for him in the fields, where God keeps an open house. I thought I had rediscovered one of those truths which are revealed to savages and hid from political economists: at the least, I had discovered a new pleasure for myself. And yet even while I was exulting in my solitude I became aware of a strange lack. I wished a companion to lie near me in the starlight, silent and not moving, but ever within touch. For there is a fellowship more quiet even than solitude, and which, rightly understood, is solitude made perfect. And to live out of doors with the woman a man loves is of all lives the most complete and free."
"我正这样躺着，畅心快意又略感美中不足之际，一阵细微的喧噪之声穿过松林，遥遥传了过来。我一开始以为是从很远的农庄那边传来的鸡犬之声；但慢慢地，它在我耳边越来越清晰，逐渐形成音调，直到我意识到有个赶路人正从谷中的大路上走过，一边走一边大声唱着歌。歌声虽不优美，却很亲切；他响亮地唱着，歌声飘荡在山坡上，翠谷中的空气都因之激荡起来了。在沉睡的城市中，我曾听到行人趁着夜色赶路；有些人会唱歌；我记得有一个人还响亮地吹着风笛。我曾听到过，几小时的寂静后，推车或者马车的吱嘎声霍然响起，然后离去，几分钟后待我躺到床上声音才消失在耳畔。所有黑夜里还在户外活动的人们都有其神秘性，我们会带着几分恐惧猜测他们的举动。但是现在有双重的神秘：首先，是这位愉快的赶路人，酒意陶然，整夜里扯着嗓子唱歌；然后，是裹在睡袋里的我，在松林里独自抽着烟，四五千英尺远的高处，是天上的繁星。","As I thus lay, between content and longing, a faint noise stole towards me through the pines. I thought, at first, it was the crowing of cocks or the barking of dogs at some very distant farm; but steadily and gradually it took articulate shape in my ears, until I became aware that a passenger was going by upon the high-road in the valley, and singing loudly as he went. There was more of good-will than grace in his performance; but he trolled with ample lungs; and the sound of his voice took hold upon the hillside and set the air shaking in the leafy glens. I have heard people passing by night in sleeping cities; some of them sang; one, I remember, played loudly on the bagpipes. I have heard the rattle of a cart or carriage spring up suddenly after hours of stillness, and pass, for some minutes, within the range of my hearing as I lay abed. There is a romance about all who are abroad in the black hours, and with something of a thrill we try to guess their business. But here the romance was double: first, this glad passenger, lit internally with wine, who sent up his voice in music through the night; and then I, on the other hand, buckled into my sack, and smoking alone in the pine-woods between four and five thousand feet towards the stars. "
"我再次醒来的时候（9月29日，礼拜日），很多星星不见了；只有那些较强的黑夜之伴仍然在头顶闪烁可见；我看到东方的天际线上，飘着一团微微发光的薄雾，就像我上次醒来时所看到的银河。朝阳即将喷薄而出。我点亮灯笼，借着萤火虫般的亮光，穿上靴子，系好绑腿；然后掰了些碎面包喂了小乖，在泉眼处接满水罐，又点上酒精灯为自己煮了些热巧克力。我酣眠的林间空地上依然弥漫着深蓝的夜色；但很快维瓦赖山巅上出现了很宽的一带橙色，然后又融合在金光里。看到曙光缓缓地、美妙地呈现，一种肃穆的喜悦占据了我的心灵。我愉快地听着潺潺流水之声；举目四望，想找到一些意想不到的美丽之处；然而，静止的黑色松树、低洼的林间空地、大嚼青草的驴子，它们的轮廓并没有什么改变。一切都没有变化，除了晨光，而晨光，的确为林中的一切带来了无限生机和宁静，也把我带入了一种奇异的兴奋之中。","When I awoke again (Sunday, 29th September), many of the stars had disappeared; only the stronger companions of the night still burned visibly overhead; and away towards the east I saw a faint haze of light upon the horizon, such as had been the Milky Way when I was last awake. Day was at hand. I lit my lantern, and by its glow-worm light put on my boots and gaiters; then I broke up some bread for Modestine, filled my can at the water-tap, and lit my spirit-lamp to boil myself some chocolate. The blue darkness lay long in the glade where I had so sweetly slumbered; but soon there was a broad streak of orange melting into gold along the mountain-tops of Vivarais. A solemn glee possessed my mind at this gradual and lovely coming in of day. I heard the runnel with delight; I looked round me for something beautiful and unexpected; but the still black pine-trees, the hollow glade, the munching ass, remained unchanged in figure. Nothing had altered but the light, and that, indeed, shed over all a spirit of life and of breathing peace, and moved me to a strange exhilaration. "
"我喝下了兑水的巧克力，虽然不浓，但是很热，然后在空地周围来回溜达了一下。我为此耽搁的时候，一阵劲风，长得像沉重的叹息，从东方晨曦处直直吹了过来。风很冷，吹得我直打喷嚏。附近松树黑色的树冠立刻在风中摇摆不已；我看到，在东方金色晨光的映衬下，远方山岩边松树细细的尖顶轻轻地来回摆动。十分钟后，阳光迅速洒遍山坡，播下一片片光和影，白昼彻底来临了。","I drank my water-chocolate, which was hot if it was not rich, and strolled here and there, and up and down about the glade. While I was thus delaying, a gush of steady wind, as long as a heavy sigh, poured direct out of the quarter of the morning. It was cold, and set me sneezing. The trees near at hand tossed their black plumes in its passage; and I could see the thin distant spires of pine along the edge of the hill rock slightly to and fro against the golden east. Ten minutes after, the sunlight spread at a gallop along the hillside, scattering shadows and sparkles, and the day had come completely. "
"我赶紧收拾好行装，沿着面前的陡坡奋力向上爬；但同时也在思量着什么。这只是一个古怪的念头；但怪念头有时也是挥之不去的。在我那绿色的大旅馆里，我受到了最亲切适当的招待。房间通风良好，水质甘澈，曙光也准时把我叫醒。我还没有提及它那美丽的织锦挂毯，或是无与伦比的穹顶，也没有提到我透过窗户眺望到的美景；但我觉得我因为这所有慷慨的款待欠下了人情。所以，我半开玩笑地把一些钱放在我经过的草地上，直到我留够了这晚的房费，这样做让我觉得很愉悦。我相信，它们不会落入那些有钱而粗野的牲口贩子手中。","I hastened to prepare my pack, and tackle the steep ascent that lay before me; but I had something on my mind. It was only a fancy; yet a fancy will sometimes be importunate. I had been most hospitably received and punctually served in my green caravanserai. The room was airy, the water excellent, and the dawn had called me to a moment. I say nothing of the tapestries or the inimitable ceiling, nor yet of the view which I commanded from the windows; but I felt I was in some one’s debt for all this liberal entertainment. And so it pleased me, in a half-laughing way, to leave pieces of money on the turf as I went along, until I had left enough for my night’s lodging. I trust they did not fall to some rich and churlish drover."

"11.跨过洛泽尔山脉","XI. Across The Lozère"
"昨晚走的小路很快就消失了，我又沿着一片不见树木的草地往山上走，草地旁竖着一排石柱，就像我翻越古莱山时那样。天气已经热起来了。我把夹克系在睡袋上，只穿着一件针织背心走着。小乖兴致很高，竟然主动哒哒地一路小跑，颠得我上衣口袋里的燕麦哗哗作响，在我的经验里这还是第一次。景色从我们身后的热沃当北部一路延伸，越来越开阔。荒凉的山脉向北、向东、向西延伸，旷野中找不到一棵树、一间房，山岚笼罩的地方，呈现出一片青色，而阳光照耀处，则是金色的。路上有许多小鸟飞来飞去，发出阵阵啾啾唧唧的鸟鸣；它们时而在石柱上歇脚，时而在草地上啄食，或者神气活现地走来走去；我看到它们成群地在蓝色的天空中盘旋，扑闪的翅膀在阳光下不时地呈现出半透明的颜色。","The track that I had followed in the evening soon died out, and I continued to follow over a bald turf ascent a row of stone pillars, such as had conducted me across the Goulet. It was already warm. I tied my jacket on the pack, and walked in my knitted waistcoat. Modestine herself was in high spirits, and broke of her own accord, for the first time in my experience, into a jolting trot that set the oats swashing in the pocket of my coat. The view, back upon the northern Gévaudan, extended with every step; scarce a tree, scarce a house, appeared upon the fields of wild hill that ran north, east, and west, all blue and gold in the haze and sunlight of the morning. A multitude of little birds kept sweeping and twittering about my path; they perched on the stone pillars, they pecked and strutted on the turf, and I saw them circle in volleys in the blue air, and show, from time to time, translucent flickering wings between the sun and me. "
"几乎从踏上旅途的第一步起，我就隐约听到一片澎湃之声，好像远方的海潮，若有若无地传入我的耳中。我有时觉得那是邻近的瀑布发出的水声，有时又想是寂静的空山所带来的幻觉。但当我继续向前，声音也越来越大，就像是一个巨大的茶罐煮水时发出的嘶嘶声，就在这时，从山顶吹来了阵阵凉风。最后我终于明白了。这风从南面吹来，强劲地吹着洛泽尔山的另一侧山坡，我每向前一步，离风就更近一步。","Almost from the first moment of my march, a faint large noise, like a distant surf, had filled my ears. Sometimes I was tempted to think it the voice of a neighbouring waterfall, and sometimes a subjective result of the utter stillness of the hill. But as I continued to advance, the noise increased, and became like the hissing of an enormous tea-urn, and at the same time breaths of cool air began to reach me from the direction of the summit. At length I understood. It was blowing stiffly from the south upon the other slope of the Lozère, and every step that I took I was drawing nearer to the wind. "
"尽管期待已久，但当我最终站在山顶骋目四望时，还是感到非常意外。尽管最后一步看起来并不比之前迈出的很多步子更为关键——就“像刚勇的科尔特斯，用他锐利的鹰眼，注视着太平洋，”我自命为这个新发现的世界一角的主人。因为，看哪，现在的风景已不再是我之前爬了许久的蔓草丛生的山崖，而是云雾缭绕的天空，还有脚下连绵起伏的青山。","Although it had been long desired, it was quite unexpectedly at last that my eyes rose above the summit. A step that seemed no way more decisive than many other steps that had preceded it—and, “like stout Cortez when, with eagle eyes, he stared on the Pacific,”1 I took possession, in my own name, of a new quarter of the world. For behold, instead of the gross turf rampart I had been mounting for so long, a view into the hazy air of heaven, and a land of intricate blue hills below my feet. "
"洛泽尔山脉近乎横贯东西，把热沃当分成了不等的两部分。它的最高峰，菲尼厄尔峰，也就是当时我脚下的山峰，海拔五千六百英尺，天气晴朗时，立于其上可以俯瞰朗格多克南部全境直到地中海一带。我跟一些人聊过天，他们佯称或者真的相信自己曾在菲尼厄尔峰上看到了白色的船只航行经过蒙波利埃和赛特港。在我身后，是北部高地上的乡村，那是我来时经过的地方，那儿的居民愚钝无趣，当地没有什么树木，山川也不见壮丽，过去除了狼群并没有什么闻名之处。但在我面前，半笼罩在一片光亮的雾霭中的，是一个全新的热沃当，它富饶、美丽，因为一些风云激荡的事件而闻名于世。从广义上说，整个旅行中我都身处莫纳斯捷的塞文山脉；但根据当地严格意义上的说法，这个地名只属于我脚下这曲折萦回、荒草丛生的山区，这是当地农民的叫法。这里是带有强调色彩的塞文山区：塞文山区里的塞文山区。在这片错综复杂的迷宫似的山区里，曾经爆发过一场强盗般的战争，也是场野兽般的战争。战争持续了两年，一方是“伟大的君主”以及他的元帅和部队，另一方是几千名信仰新教的山里人。一百八十年前，甚至在我现在站着的洛泽尔山上都设有卡米撒派的岗哨；他们有自身的组织，有军火库，还有军事和宗教上的等级制度；他们的事迹是伦敦城“每个咖啡馆里的话题”；英国曾派军舰支援他们；他们的领袖预言未来也进行杀戮；他们的队伍有时伴随着旌旗和锣鼓声，高唱着古老的法国圣歌，在大白天行军经过城墙高筑的城市，驱散国王的将军；有时在夜里，或是通过伪装，攻占坚固的城堡，报复盟军的背叛和敌人的凶残。一百八十年前，这儿曾有位英勇的罗兰，“罗兰伯爵，法兰西新教大元帅”，他严肃、沉默、专横，是一位一脸麻子的退伍龙骑兵，有位女士因为爱他跟随他到处漂泊。还有卡瓦利埃，面包房学徒，是位战争天才，十七岁被选为卡米撒派军队的准将，五十五岁去世时是泽西岛的英国总督。还有卡斯塔内，一位戴着长长假发、喜爱争论神学问题的党派领袖。这是一群古怪的将军，他们离群独处，以向万军之主耶和华寻求启示，他们逃开或挑起战争，布置岗哨或睡在没有护卫的营地，听从神灵向他们的心灵发出的耳语！然后，追随着这些和其他领袖的，是先知和信徒组成的士兵们，他们英勇，坚忍，不知疲倦，长于山间奔袭，用圣歌歌唱他们艰苦的生活，渴望战斗，热爱祷告，虔诚地听着癫狂的孩子们的预言，把麦粒神秘地放在锡弹中，再装进他们的步枪里。","The Lozère lies nearly east and west, cutting Gévaudan into two unequal parts; its highest point, this Pic de Finiels, on which I was then standing, rises upwards of five thousand six hundred feet above the sea, and in clear weather commands a view over all lower Languedoc to the Mediterranean Sea. I have spoken with people who either pretended or believed that they had seen, from the Pic de Finiels, white ships sailing by Montpellier and Cette. Behind was the upland northern country through which my way had lain, peopled by a dull race, without wood, without much grandeur of hill-form, and famous in the past for little beside wolves. But in front of me, half veiled in sunny haze, lay a new Gévaudan, rich, picturesque, illustrious for stirring events. Speaking largely, I was in the Cévennes at Monastier, and during all my journey; but there is a strict and local sense in which only this confused and shaggy country at my feet has any title to the name, and in this sense the peasantry employ the word. These are the Cévennes with an emphasis: the Cévennes of the Cévennes. In that undecipherable labyrinth of hills, a war of bandits, a war of wild beasts, raged for two years between the Grand Monarch2 with all his troops and marshals on the one hand, and a few thousand Protestant mountaineers upon the other. A hundred and eighty years ago, the Camisards3 held a station even on the Lozère, where I stood; they had an organisation, arsenals, a military and religious hierarchy; their affairs were “the discourse of every coffee-house” in London; England sent fleets in their support; their leaders prophesied and murdered; with colours and drums, and the singing of old French psalms, their bands sometimes affronted daylight, marched before walled cities, and dispersed the generals of the king; and sometimes at night, or in masquerade, possessed themselves of strong castles, and avenged treachery upon their allies and cruelty upon their foes. There, a hundred and eighty years ago, was the chivalrous Roland4, “Count and Lord Roland, generalissimo of the Protestants in France,” grave, silent, imperious, pock-marked ex-dragoon, whom a lady followed in his wanderings out of love. There was Cavalier5, a baker’s apprentice with a genius for war, elected brigadier of Camisards at seventeen, to die at fifty-five the English governor of Jersey. There again was Castanet6, a partisan leader in a voluminous peruke and with a taste for controversial divinity. Strange generals, who moved apart to take counsel with the God of Hosts, and fled or offered battle, set sentinels or slept in an unguarded camp, as the Spirit whispered to their hearts! And there, to follow these and other leaders, was the rank and file of prophets and disciples, bold, patient, indefatigable, hardy to run upon the mountains, cheering their rough life with psalms, eager to fight, eager to pray, listening devoutly to the oracles of brain-sick children, and mystically putting a grain of wheat among the pewter balls with which they charged their muskets. "
"在此之前，我游历的都是些乏味的地区，一路上遇到的最著名的事物也不过就是热沃当食人野兽，即那条狼中的拿破仑·波拿巴。但现在我即将进入的地方，曾经经历过世界历史中风云变换的一章，——或者更妙地说，是世界历史中一条富有传奇色彩的脚注。当一切尘埃散尽，那些过往的英雄事迹现在还留下些什么呢？据说在这个新教抵抗运动的前沿地区，新教信仰仍然存在，这一点我曾在修道院的接待室里多次听那位牧师自己提起过。但我还不知道它仅是残存的一点遗风，还是一项仍然有生机的传统。而且，如果说北部塞文山区的人们宗教意识狭隘，心中充满对宗教的热诚而甚于博爱之心，那么在这片充满宗教迫害和报复的土地上，我又能指望看到什么呢？——正是在这里，天主教会的暴政激起了卡米撒派的叛乱，而卡米撒派的恐怖政策又反过来逼得信仰天主教的农民走上了合法反抗之路，卡米撒派和弗洛朗帮于是就在这群山之间相互躲避，以求保命。","I had travelled hitherto through a dull district, and in the track of nothing more notable than the child-eating beast of Gévaudan, the Napoléon Bonaparte of wolves. But now I was to go down into the scene of a romantic chapter—or, better, a romantic footnote in the history of the world. What was left of all this bygone dust and heroism? I was told that Protestantism still survived in this head seat of Protestant resistance; so much the priest himself had told me in the monastery parlour. But I had yet to learn if it were a bare survival, or a lively and generous tradition. Again, if in the northern Cévennes the people are narrow in religious judgments, and more filled with zeal than charity, what was I to look for in this land of persecution and reprisal—in a land where the tyranny of the Church produced the Camisard rebellion, and the terror of the Camisards threw the Catholic peasantry into legalised revolt upon the other side, so that Camisard and Florentin7 skulked for each other’s lives among the mountains? "
"就在我驻步远望的山顶上，那排石柱陡然而止。往下一点，一条勉强可称之为路的小道顺着陡削的山坡螺旋而下。随着下降的山势，小路伸向一个山谷，地面上竖着粗短的石块，就像收割后的玉米地，继续往前，青草开始铺满山谷。我顺着小路疾步而下；急转而下的山势，还有路上一个个的急转弯，以及那从未磨灭的想在新的地方看到新鲜事物的愿望，都聚在一起，好像为我插上了双翅。再下面一点，出现了一道由几股山泉汇集而成的溪涧，欢快地在山间潺潺流淌。这山溪有时会变成小小的一道飞瀑，穿过小路，形成一个小潭，小乖就在里面清凉一下它疲倦的四蹄。","Just on the brow of the hill, where I paused to look before me, the series of stone pillars came abruptly to an end; and only a little below, a sort of track appeared and began to go down a break-neck slope, turning like a corkscrew as it went. It led into a valley between falling hills, stubbly with rocks like a reaped field of corn, and floored farther down with green meadows. I followed the track with precipitation; the steepness of the slope, the continual agile turning of the line of the descent, and the old unwearied hope of finding something new in a new country, all conspired to lend me wings. Yet a little lower and a stream began, collecting itself together out of many fountains, and soon making a glad noise among the hills. Sometimes it would cross the track in a bit of waterfall, with a pool, in which Modestine refreshed her feet. "
"整个下山的路程对我来说就像一场梦，很快就走完了。我才刚刚从山顶下来，山谷就围住了我的前路，阳光照在身上，我走在低地平静的空气里。小径变成了大路，平缓地起伏。我经过一个又一个茅舍，但似乎所有的茅屋都无人居住；看不到一个人影，也听不到人声，耳畔只有小河的淙淙流水之声。不管怎样，我现在已置身于和昨日完全不同的世界了。这世界那布满岩石的轮廓充满生机地暴露在阳光和空气中。山坡峭拔而变化万千。一棵棵橡树紧紧攀着山岩，枝繁叶茂，让秋天染上了绚烂夺目的色彩。左右两侧不时可以看到一道流泉飞瀑，泻在布满巨石的雪白峡谷里。山溪向前涌流，一路从四面八方汇集泉水，很快成了一条小河。小河在尽头（由于这是一条迅速形成的河流，一路流淌过程中，汇聚了不少的溪流）时而湍浚奔流，溅起层层泡沫，时而聚成小潭，潭水漾着醉人的碧蓝色，中间还闪烁着浅浅的褐色。在我一生之中，还从未见到过如此变化莫测又美妙绝伦的色彩。水晶不比其莹澈，而草地不得其一半的碧绿。每看到一个小潭，我就不由得感到一阵渴望，想要脱下这沾满尘土的闷热的衣服，把赤裸的身子沉浸在这山间的空气和潭水中。我一路走来，从未忘记今天是安息日；空气中的寂静一直在提醒着我；我在冥冥中听到全欧洲教堂里的钟都敲响了，从千百个教堂中传出了赞美诗的吟唱声。","The whole descent is like a dream to me, so rapidly was it accomplished. I had scarcely left the summit ere the valley had closed round my path, and the sun beat upon me, walking in a stagnant lowland atmosphere. The track became a road, and went up and down in easy undulations. I passed cabin after cabin, but all seemed deserted; and I saw not a human creature, nor heard any sound except that of the stream. I was, however, in a different country from the day before. The stony skeleton of the world was here vigorously displayed to sun and air. The slopes were steep and changeful. Oak-trees clung along the hills, well grown, wealthy in leaf, and touched by the autumn with strong and luminous colours. Here and there another stream would fall in from the right or the left, down a gorge of snow-white and tumultuary boulders. The river in the bottom (for it was rapidly growing a river, collecting on all hands as it trotted on its way) here foamed a while in desperate rapids, and there lay in pools of the most enchanting sea-green shot with watery browns. As far as I have gone, I have never seen a river of so changeful and delicate a hue; crystal was not more clear, the meadows were not by half so green; and at every pool I saw I felt a thrill of longing to be out of these hot, dusty, and material garments, and bathe my naked body in the mountain air and water. All the time as I went on I never forgot it was the Sabbath; the stillness was a perpetual reminder; and I heard in spirit the church-bells clamouring all over Europe, and the psalms of a thousand churches. "
"我终于听到了人类的声音——一种夹杂着痛苦和嘲笑的奇怪的叫声；我的目光越过山谷，看到一个小孩子坐在草地上，双手环膝，缩成小小的一团，因为距离很远，显得很是滑稽。但当我沿着山路，赶着小乖走过一棵棵橡树时，这捣蛋鬼已经看到了我。他用颤抖尖锐的嗓音向我发出这一地区的问候。正如相隔够远，又透过如此清新的空气和青翠的山谷，任何吵声都显得宜人而自然那样，这次也不例外，在我听来，他的嗓音非常悦耳，充满乡村风情，就像这些橡树和小河。","At length a human sound struck upon my ear—a cry strangely modulated between pathos and derision; and looking across the valley, I saw a little urchin sitting in a meadow, with his hands about his knees, and dwarfed to almost comical smallness by the distance. But the rogue had picked me out as I went down the road, from oak wood on to oak wood, driving Modestine; and he made me the compliments of the new country in this tremulous high-pitched salutation. And as all noises are lovely and natural at a sufficient distance, this also, coming through so much clean hill air and crossing all the green valley, sounded pleasant to my ear, and seemed a thing rustic, like the oaks or the river. "
"又走了一小段，伴我同行的小溪在充满血腥记忆的蒙瓦特桥边流进了塔恩河。","A little after, the stream that I was following fell into the Tarn at Pont de Montvert of bloody memory."

"12.蒙瓦特桥","XII. Pont De Montvert"
"如果没有记错的话，我在蒙瓦特桥最先见到的事物中，有一座新教的教堂；这教堂正是这里其他新事物的代表。有一种微妙的气氛把英国和法国的城镇区分开来，甚至让它和苏格兰的城镇显得迥然不同。在卡莱尔你会发现自己身处一个国家；而在三十英里之外的邓弗里斯，你会很确定自己是在另一个国家。很难说清蒙瓦特桥和勒莫纳斯捷，或者朗戈涅，甚至和布莱马尔有什么具体的不同；但它们的不同是存在的，而且这些不同还非常鲜明地呈现在我们眼前。在这个地区，它的房屋、乡间小路、闪闪发光的河床，都给人一种难以言说的南方韵味。","One of the first things I encountered in Pont de Montvert was, if I remember rightly, the Protestant temple; but this was but the type of other novelties. A subtle atmosphere distinguishes a town in England from a town in France, or even in Scotland. At Carlisle you can see you are in the one country; at Dumfries, thirty miles away, you are as sure that you are in the other. I should find it difficult to tell in what particulars Pont de Montvert differed from Monastier or Langogne, or even Bleymard; but the difference existed, and spoke eloquently to the eyes. The place, with its houses, its lanes, its glaring river-bed, wore an indescribable air of the South. "
"不论是街道上还是酒馆里，到处都呈现出星期日的熙攘忙碌，就像在山间万物总是呈现出一派安息日的宁静一样。上午十一点钟的时候，酒馆里就有将近二十人来吃午饭；我吃饱喝足后坐在那里写我的日志，看到又有几乎同样多的人，或一个接一个，或三三两两地走了进来。翻越洛泽尔山时，我不仅身处全新的自然景色之中，同时也走进了一个不同民族的地域。吃饭的人们一面用舞剑般精妙的刀法匆匆切割着食物，一面向我问长问短，也回答着我的问题，言辞间的才智超出我之前遇到的所有人，只有夏塞拉代的铁路工人才比得上。他们喜怒形于色，言行举止间洋溢着热情。他们不仅完全能够理解我的小小旅行，领略其中的意趣，而且，不只一个人宣称，如果有足够的钱，也要进行一番这样的旅行。","All was Sunday bustle in the streets and in the public-house, as all had been Sabbath peace among the mountains. There must have been near a score of us at dinner by eleven before noon; and after I had eaten and drunken, and sat writing up my journal, I suppose as many more came dropping in one after another, or by twos and threes. In crossing the Lozère I had not only come among new natural features, but moved into the territory of a different race. These people, as they hurriedly despatched their viands in an intricate sword-play of knives, questioned and answered me with a degree of intelligence which excelled all that I had met, except among the railway folk at Chasseradès. They had open telling faces, and were lively both in speech and manner. They not only entered thoroughly into the spirit of my little trip, but more than one declared, if he were rich enough, he would like to set forth on such another. "
"甚至在外貌方面，这儿的人们也令人耳目一新。自离开勒莫纳斯捷后，我还没有见过一个俊俏的女子，现在这里就有一个。和我同桌吃饭的三人中，其中一位绝对称不上美丽，她是一位四十岁左右、羞怯可怜的女子，被这顿嘈杂喧闹的酒席搅得心神不宁。我大献殷勤，为她倒酒，又为她祝酒，百般鼓励她喝，可结果却适得其反；但是另外两位已婚的女士，都要比一般女人长得漂亮。至于克拉丽丝？我该怎样形容克拉丽丝呢？她是个凝重、温厚、冷漠的女招待，好像一头耕地的母牛；她大大的灰眼睛里含着多情而倦怠的神色；她的容貌，虽说有些丰满，却清新精致；嘴唇微微翘起；鼻孔显出一种雅致的骄傲；脸颊的线条奇妙动人。这张脸可以表现出强烈的情感，经过训练，也可表达微妙的情意。看到这样一张美丽的脸庞只能留在乡间，被乡下人用乡下人的思维打量欣赏，真是可惜。美貌至少应和社会接触；然后立刻甩开覆在它之上的重负，开始意识到自身的存在，开始做出文雅的举止，学会了优雅的步态和头部的仪态，于是，转瞬之间，美貌“就如女神般现身了”。离开之前，我再三向克拉丽丝表达我衷心的爱慕。她泰然自若地听着，既没有因此而局促不安，也不显得多么惊奇，只是用她的大眼睛沉静地看着我。我承认，这反而使我自己有些迷惑了。如果克拉丽丝看得懂英语的话，我是不敢接着说她的体态是配不上她的脸蛋的。她需要一个紧身衣来使身材完美；但随着年龄的增长，情况也许会有所改善。","Even physically there was a pleasant change. I had not seen a pretty woman since I left Monastier, and there but one. Now of the three who sat down with me to dinner, one was certainly not beautiful—a poor timid thing of forty, quite troubled at this roaring table d’hote, whom I squired and helped to wine, and pledged and tried generally to encourage, with quite a contrary effect; but the other two, both married, were both more handsome than the average of women. And Clarisse? What shall I say of Clarisse? She waited the table with a heavy placable nonchalance, like a performing cow; her great grey eyes were steeped in amorous languor; her features, although fleshy, were of an original and accurate design; her mouth had a curl; her nostril spoke of dainty pride; her cheek fell into strange and interesting lines. It was a face capable of strong emotion, and, with training, it offered the promise of delicate sentiment. It seemed pitiful to see so good a model left to country admirers and a country way of thought. Beauty should at least have touched society; then, in a moment, it throws off a weight that lay upon it, it becomes conscious of itself, it puts on an elegance, learns a gait and a carriage of the head, and, in a moment, patet dea. Before I left I assured Clarisse of my hearty admiration. She took it like milk, without embarrassment or wonder, merely looking at me steadily with her great eyes; and I own the result upon myself was some confusion. If Clarisse could read English, I should not dare to add that her figure was unworthy of her face. Hers was a case for stays; but that may perhaps grow better as she gets up in years. "
"蒙瓦特桥，或者像在国内那样被称为青山桥，是卡米撒派的历史故事中一个具有纪念意义的地方。战争是在此爆发的；也是在这里，那些法国南部地区的国民誓约派成员杀死了他们的大主教夏普。在当前平静的日子里，对于持有温和的现代信仰和怀疑的我们来说，无论是当时那些残酷的迫害，还是疯狂的热情，都是难以理解的。所有新教徒都因为狂热和悲伤而失去了理智。他们不论男女，都成了预言家。还在吃奶的婴儿会恳请他们的父母投身正义的事业。“基萨克一个十五个月大的婴儿，在他妈妈的怀里说起话来，神情激动，涕泪横飞，声音大而清晰。”维拉尔元帅曾见过这样一座城，那里满城的女人都“似乎被恶魔附了身”，她们浑身颤抖抽搐，在街上公开喊叫着预言。维瓦赖的一个女预言家在蒙比利埃被绞死了，因为鲜血从她的眼睛和鼻子里流出来，而她宣称，她的血泪是为新教徒的不幸而流的。还不只是妇女和孩子。那些过去惯于挥舞镰刀或伐木斧头的强壮而危险的男人们，也会莫名其妙地发作，涕泗滂沱地诉说着神谕。前所未有的暴力迫害持续了将近二十年，而这就是它给受迫害者所带来的后果；绞刑、火刑、车裂，都徒劳无功；龙骑兵的铁蹄踏遍了整个乡村地区；许多男子被罚在船舰上划桨，许多女子在教会的监狱里憔悴消瘦；但是，所有正直的新教徒心中的信念却丝毫未变。","Pont de Montvert, or Greenhill Bridge, as we might say at home, is a place memorable in the story of the Camisards. It was here that the war broke out; here that those southern Covenanters slew their Archbishop Sharpe1. The persecution on the one hand, the febrile enthusiasm on the other, are almost equally difficult to understand in these quiet modern days, and with our easy modern beliefs and disbeliefs. The Protestants were one and all beside their right minds with zeal and sorrow. They were all prophets and prophetesses. Children at the breast would exhort their parents to good works. “A child of fifteen months at Quissac spoke from its mother’s arms, agitated and sobbing, distinctly and with a loud voice.” Marshal Villars2 has seen a town where all the women “seemed possessed by the devil,” and had trembling fits, and uttered prophecies publicly upon the streets. A prophetess of Vivarais was hanged at Montpellier because blood flowed from her eyes and nose, and she declared that she was weeping tears of blood for the misfortunes of the Protestants. And it was not only women and children. Stalwart dangerous fellows, used to swing the sickle or to wield the forest axe, were likewise shaken with strange paroxysms, and spoke oracles with sobs and streaming tears. A persecution unsurpassed in violence had lasted near a score of years, and this was the result upon the persecuted; hanging, burning, breaking on the wheel, had been in vain; the dragoons had left their hoof-marks over all the countryside; there were men rowing in the galleys, and women pining in the prisons of the Church; and not a thought was changed in the heart of any upright Protestant. "
"在拉穆瓦尼翁.德巴维勒之后，迫害活动的头领和先锋，塞文地区的大司祭和传道督导弗朗索瓦.德朗格拉德.迪谢拉，在蒙瓦特桥镇有一所房子，他有时就住在那里。他是个一丝不苟的人，有着海盗的天性。他现在五十五岁，到了这个年龄，一个人早已学会了如何尽可能稳健行事。“信仰传播事业”在他这里得到了坚决彻底的执行。他在蒙瓦特的房子被他变成了一所监狱。在那里，他拿烧红了的煤块去烫囚犯的手，拔下他们的胡须，迫使他们承认在信仰方面受到了蒙蔽。","Now the head and forefront of the persecution—after Lamoignon de Bavile3—Francois de Langlade du Chayla4 (pronounce Cheila), Archpriest of the Cévennes and Inspector of Missions in the same country, had a house in which he sometimes dwelt in the town of Pont de Montvert. He was a conscientious person, who seems to have been intended by nature for a pirate, and now fifty-five, an age by which a man has learned all the moderation of which he is capable. The Work of the Propagation of the Faith went roundly forward in his hands. His house in Pont de Montvert served him as a prison. There he closed the hands of his prisoners upon live coal, and plucked out the hairs of their beards, to convince them that they were deceived in their opinions. "
"在朗格多克，不仅生活让人无法忍受，就连逃亡也是被严格禁止的。一位名叫马西普的赶骡人，熟知山间路径，曾带着几批逃亡者安全地抵达了日内瓦。有一次在他护送一群人——其中大部分是女扮男装的妇女——逃亡的时候，迪谢拉把魔掌伸向了他。不过这次倒霉的却是迪谢拉自己。随后的那个星期天，在布热山的阿尔特法树林里，新教徒们秘密集会；在会上塞吉埃站了出来，他被同伴们称为“圣灵塞吉埃”。他是个梳毛工人，身材高大，脸色黝黑，牙齿都脱落了，但他却很有预言的天赋。他以上帝的名义宣称，屈服的时代已经过去了，他们必须拿起武器抗争，以换取教友的释放和牧师的毁灭。","Not only was life made intolerable in Languedoc, but f light was rigidly forbidden. One Massip, a muleteer, and well acquainted with the mountain-paths, had already guided several troops of fugitives in safety to Geneva; and on him, with another convoy, consisting mostly of women dressed as men, Du Chayla, in an evil hour for himself, laid his hands. The Sunday following, there was a conventicle of Protestants in the woods of Altefage upon Mount Bouges; where there stood up one Séguier5—Spirit Séguier, as his companions called him—a wool-carder, tall, black-faced, and toothless, but a man full of prophecy. He declared, in the name of God, that the time for submission had gone by, and they must betake themselves to arms for the deliverance of their brethren and the destruction of the priests. "
"次日晚上，即1702年7月24日，正当传道督导坐在蒙瓦特桥镇他用作监狱的家中时，一个声音搅得他心神不宁。一群男人高唱赞美诗的声音穿过镇子传了过来，而且越来越近。那时是晚上10点钟，他的党羽都在身边，包括牧师、士兵和仆从，大概有十二到十五个人。这时，因为害怕那些逼近家门的秘密集会者会有什么无礼的举动，他派他的士兵去打探消息。但此时唱着赞美诗的人们已经来到他的门外了，五十名强健的男人，由被神感召的塞吉埃带领着，送来了死亡的气息。对于他们的召唤，大司祭以一位顽固的迫害老手的方式进行了回应，他下令卫士向“暴民”开枪。一名“卡米撒”（有人说，正是那晚之后才出现了卡米撒派这个名字）在枪声中倒下了。他的伙伴用短柄斧头和椽木撞开房门，冲进了房屋的较低一层，释放了那里的囚犯。人们还发现其中一个囚犯被锁在木枷里，那是那个地方当时使用的一种特殊刑具，它能夹紧受刑者的身体，鲜血会从受刑者的鼻子和耳朵中流出来。这一发现更加激起了人们对迪谢拉的愤怒，他们一次又一次地发起进攻想要冲上房子的上层。但是迪谢拉却给了他的人赦罪令，因此随从们奋力守住楼梯。","The next night, 24th July 1702, a sound disturbed the Inspector of Missions as he sat in his prison-house at Pont de Montvert: the voices of many men upraised in psalmody drew nearer and nearer through the town. It was ten at night; he had his court about him, priests, soldiers, and servants, to the number of twelve or fifteen; and now dreading the insolence of a conventicle below his very windows, he ordered forth his soldiers to report. But the psalm-singers were already at his door, fifty strong, led by the inspired Séguier, and breathing death. To their summons, the archpriest made answer like a stout old persecutor, and bade his garrison fire upon the mob. One Camisard (for, according to some, it was in this night’s work that they came by the name) fell at this discharge: his comrades burst in the door with hatchets and a beam of wood, overran the lower story of the house, set free the prisoners, and finding one of them in the vine, a sort of Scavenger’s Daughter of the place and period, redoubled in fury against Du Chayla, and sought by repeated assaults to carry the upper floors. But he, on his side, had given absolution to his men, and they bravely held the staircase. "
"“上帝之子啊，”先知喊道，“暂且停下吧。让我们烧了这所房子，烧了邪神巴力的牧师和追随者吧。”","“Children of God,” cried the prophet, “hold your hands. Let us burn the house, with the priest and the satellites of Baal6.” "
"大火马上就烧起来了。迪谢拉和他的随从把床单接在一起，顺着床单从楼上的窗户下到花园里来；一些人冒着起义者的炮火逃到了河对面；但是大司祭本人却跌倒了，还摔断了大腿，于是只能爬进树篱里。当屋顶塌陷，熊熊燃烧的火焰暴露了他的藏身之地后，人们冲过来把他拖到城镇的公共场地，狂怒地称他有罪。他至少找到了一个有力的反击之词来为自己辩护——“如果我该入地狱，”他说，“那为什么你们又在做该下地狱的事情呢？”","The fire caught readily. Out of an upper window Du Chayla and his men lowered themselves into the garden by means of knotted sheets; some escaped across the river under the bullets of the insurgents; but the archpriest himself fell, broke his thigh, and could only crawl into the hedge. He found at least one telling word to say in his defence; for when the roof fell in and the upbursting flames discovered his retreat, and they came and dragged him to the public place of the town, raging and calling him damned—“If I be damned,” said he, “why should you also damn yourselves?” "
"他垂死之际所说的这句话，确实是很有道理的；但是在他做传道督导期间给出了很多更加有力的理由，每一条都与此恰恰相反；现在他马上就要听到这些理由了。由塞吉埃打头，卡米撒派的人们一个接一个地走到前面去用刀刺他。“这一下，”他们说，“是为了我被车裂的父亲而刺的。这一下是为了我在军舰上服苦役的兄弟。那一刀是为了被关在你那该死的女修道院里的妈妈或姐妹。”每人都给他一击，还讲述了他们这样做的缘由；然后所有人跪在地上，围着尸体唱起了赞美诗，一直唱到了天亮。他们迎着晨曦，一边歌唱，一边列队走向塔恩河上游的弗吕热勒斯，继续他们的复仇大业。在他们身后，迪谢拉的监狱成了一片废墟，他那被戳了五十二处伤口的尸体则摊在公共场地上。","Here was a good reason for the last; but in the course of his inspectorship he had given many stronger which all told in a contrary direction; and these he was now to hear. One by one, Séguier first, the Camisards drew near and stabbed him. “This,” they said, “is for my father broken on the wheel. This for my brother in the galleys. That for my mother or my sister imprisoned in your cursed convents.” Each gave his blow and his reason; and then all kneeled and sang psalms around the body till the dawn. With the dawn, still singing, they defiled away towards Frugeres, farther up the Tarn, to pursue the work of vengeance, leaving Du Chayla’s prison-house in ruins, and his body pierced with two-and-fifty wounds upon the public place. "
"这是一场发生在夜晚的疯狂复仇，一直伴随着赞美诗的吟唱；在塔恩河上游的那个城镇里，赞美诗似乎始终带着一种威胁的意味。但是，即使在蒙瓦特城，这个故事也并未随着卡米撒派的离去而终结。塞吉埃的生涯短暂而血腥。从那以后，又有两个牧师以及住在拉德韦兹的整整一家人，从父亲到奴仆，被他亲自或下令杀死；但他也只是肆意了一两天，由于军队开进，他的活动受到了永久的束缚。最后他被著名的军事冒险家普尔上尉所擒，在他的审判者面前，他表现得无动于衷。","’Tis a wild night’s work, with its accompaniment of psalms; and it seems as if a psalm must always have a sound of threatening in that town upon the Tarn. But the story does not end, even so far as concerns Pont de Montvert, with the departure of the Camisards. The career of Séguier was brief and bloody. Two more priests and a whole family at Ladeveze, from the father to the servants, fell by his hand or by his orders; and yet he was but a day or two at large, and restrained all the time by the presence of the soldiery. Taken at length by a famous soldier of fortune, Captain Poul7, he appeared unmoved before his judges. "
"“你的名字？”他们问。","“Your name?” they asked. "
"“皮埃尔.塞吉埃。”","“Pierre Séguier.” "
"“你为何被称为圣灵？”","“Why are you called Spirit?”"
"“因为上帝的圣灵与我同在。”","“Because the Spirit of the Lord is with me.”"
"“你的住址？”","“Your domicile?”"
"“最近在荒漠中，不久将升入天国。”","“Lately in the desert, and soon in heaven.”"
"“你不为你的罪过悔恨吗？”","“Have you no remorse for your crimes?” "
"“我没有犯罪。我的灵魂像一个满是绿阴和泉水的花园。”","“I have committed none. My soul is like a garden full of shelter and of fountains.”"
"在蒙瓦特，8月12日，他的右手被砍掉了，然后被活活烧死。他的灵魂像个花园吗？也许迪谢拉，那位基督教的殉道者的灵魂也是如此吧。也许如果你可以看到我的灵魂，或者我可以看到你的，我们表现出的镇定自若就不会那么令人吃惊吧。","At Pont de Montvert, on the 12th of August, he had his right hand stricken from his body, and was burned alive. And his soul was like a garden? So perhaps was the soul of Du Chayla, the Christian martyr. And perhaps if you could read in my soul, or I could read in yours, our own composure might seem little less surprising. "
"在城中某一座桥边，迪谢拉的房子依然存在，现在有了一个新的屋顶。如果你有兴趣，还可以看到他失足坠入的那个台地式花园。","Du Chayla’s house still stands, with a new roof, beside one of the bridges of the town; and if you are curious you may see the terrace-garden into which he dropped."

"13.在塔恩河谷","XIII. In The Valley Of The Tarn"
"一条新路，沿着塔恩河谷，从蒙瓦特桥通向弗洛拉克；这是半山腰一条平整的沙质岩架，悬在峭壁绝顶和谷底的河流之间。我沿着小路，一会儿走在绿树的浓阴里，一会儿又沐浴在午后的阳光中。这条狭路很像基利克兰基山口的那条路，是山间一条幽深曲折的隘谷，塔恩河美妙低沉的轰鸣声从下面远远传来，而上方嶙峋的山峰在阳光照耀下高耸入云。群山顶上，疏疏朗朗地立着一排水曲柳，好像废墟上爬着的常春藤；但在较低的山坡上，还有峡谷的高处，一棵棵欧洲栗亭亭如帷盖，屹立着，直指天空。有些是人工栽种的，每棵只在缓坡上占得不比一张床大的一方土地；有的攀在山坡的险峻之处，靠根部汲取着力量，长得枝叶繁茂，伟岸挺拔；还有一些，整齐地排成一排立在河边的空地上，苍劲宛如黎巴嫩的雪松。然而，即使是树木最繁密的地方，它们也绝不会被人想成是一片树林，而是被当作一群劲拔的个体。每棵树巨大的树冠都各自向外伸出，像一座座小山似的，独立于其他树冠之外。树木似有若无地送来阵阵清香，弥漫在午后的空气中。秋天在绿叶间染上了金黄和褐色的痕迹。阳光透进来，照亮了浓密宽大的枝叶，栗子也不再隐在阴影里了，而是在光亮中一颗颗凸显了出来。面对此景，我这个浅陋的画者只能无望地放下画笔。","A new road leads from Pont de Montvert to Florac by the valley of the Tarn; a smooth sandy ledge, it runs about half-way between the summit of the cliffs and the river in the bottom of the valley; and I went in and out, as I followed it, from bays of shadow into promontories of afternoon sun. This was a pass like that of Killiecrankie; a deep turning gully in the hills, with the Tarn making a wonderful hoarse uproar far below, and craggy summits standing in the sunshine high above. A thin fringe of ash-trees ran about the hill-tops, like ivy on a ruin; but on the lower slopes, and far up every glen, the Spanish chestnut-trees stood each four-square to heaven under its tented foliage. Some were planted, each on its own terrace no larger than a bed; some, trusting in their roots, found strength to grow and prosper and be straight and large upon the rapid slopes of the valley; others, where there was a margin to the river, stood marshalled in a line and mighty like cedars of Lebanon. Yet even where they grew most thickly they were not to be thought of as a wood, but as a herd of stalwart individuals; and the dome of each tree stood forth separate and large, and as it were a little hill, from among the domes of its companions. They gave forth a faint sweet perfume which pervaded the air of the afternoon; autumn had put tints of gold and tarnish in the green; and the sun so shone through and kindled the broad foliage, that each chestnut was relieved against another, not in shadow, but in light. A humble sketcher here laid down his pencil in despair."
"我希望我可以描绘出这些高贵树木的生长历程：它们是怎样像橡树那样伸展着它们的枝桠，又像柳树那样拖曳着低垂的枝条；它们是怎样像教堂里的柱子那样笔直挺立着长有凹槽的树干；或者像橄榄树，在损伤最严重的树干上也能发出柔嫩的新芽，从而在朽木上重新焕发出新的生机。它们就这样融合了众多不同树木的特点；甚至在近处看他们多刺的树顶，在天空的映衬下，也依稀带着些许棕榈树的丰姿，令人印象深刻。尽管综合了如此多的元素，他们自身的特点却显得更丰富、更独特。低头看到那被小山似的树冠覆盖着的平地，或是看见那一蔟蔟永不屈服的老栗树“像成群的大象一样”横在突出的山嘴上，人们会更深地体会到大自然的力量。","I wish I could convey a notion of the growth of these noble trees; of how they strike out boughs like the oak, and trail sprays of drooping foliage like the willow; of how they stand on upright fluted columns like the pillars of a church; or like the olive, from the most shattered bole can put out smooth and youthful shoots, and begin a new life upon the ruins of the old. Thus they partake of the nature of many different trees; and even their prickly top-knots, seen near at hand against the sky, have a certain palm-like air that impresses the imagination. But their individuality, although compounded of so many elements, is but the richer and the more original. And to look down upon a level filled with these knolls of foliage, or to see a clan of old unconquerable chestnuts cluster “like herded elephants” upon the spur of a mountain, is to rise to higher thoughts of the powers that are in Nature. "
"因为小乖慢吞吞的性子和沿途美丽的山景，我们整个下午都没走多少路；最后发现虽然离天黑还早，太阳却已经开始离开狭长的塔恩河谷，于是我开始寻找可以宿营的地方。要找到合适的地方并不容易，那些梯田都太窄了，而不是梯田的地面又往往过于陡峭，容不得人躺在上面。我可能会在夜里从山坡上滑下来，早上醒来时发现自己的脚或者头浸在河里。","Between Modestine’s laggard humour and the beauty of the scene, we made little progress all that afternoon; and at last finding the sun, although still far from setting, was already beginning to desert the narrow valley of the Tarn, I began to cast about for a place to camp in. This was not easy to find; the terraces were too narrow, and the ground, where it was unterraced, was usually too steep for a man to lie upon. I should have slipped all night, and awakened towards morning with my feet or my head in the river. "
"走了大概一英里后，我看到在离路大约六英尺高的地方，有一块小小的高地，足以放下我的睡袋，一根粗大的栗子树树干横在边上，成了安全的护栏。我对着不情不愿的小乖又刺又踢，费尽辛苦才把她赶到那里，然后匆匆卸下了她身上的行李。这块高地只容得下我一个人，我不得不又向上走了差不多同样长的距离，才给这头驴子也找到了可以歇脚的地方。那是一块建在一堆乱石之上的人工砌成的台地，总共还不足五平方英尺。我把她拴在一棵栗树上，喂了她谷子和面包，还摘了一堆她垂涎已久的栗树叶，然后又下行回到了我的宿营地。","After perhaps a mile, I saw, some sixty feet above the road, a little plateau large enough to hold my sack, and securely parapeted by the trunk of an aged and enormous chestnut. Thither, with infinite trouble, I goaded and kicked the reluctant Modestine, and there I hastened to unload her. There was only room for myself upon the plateau, and I had to go nearly as high again before I found so much as standing-room for the ass. It was on a heap of rolling stones, on an artificial terrace, certainly not five feet square in all. Here I tied her to a chestnut, and having given her corn and bread and made a pile of chestnut-leaves, of which I found her greedy, I descended once more to my own encampment. "
"可恼的是，这里不够隐蔽。路上有一两辆马车经过；在余晖落尽之前，我都像个被搜捕的卡米撒派教徒一样，躲在巨大的栗木树干围成的堡垒后面，因为我非常害怕被人发现，害怕夜里会有些爱开玩笑的家伙来骚扰我。另外，我意识到我必须很早醒来，因为就在前一天，这些栗树园里还有人在辛苦地劳作。山坡上撒满了砍下的树枝，而且到处是一堆堆靠着树干堆放的树叶，因为就连树叶也是有用途的，冬天农夫们把它们当作牲口的草料。我半躺半坐地躲避着路人，胆战心惊地吃了一点儿晚饭。我敢说，我警觉得就像是一个探子，在那充满赞美诗和鲜血的古老年代里，被在洛泽尔山上活动的若阿尼，或是在塔恩河流域活动的萨洛蒙派出来刺探情报。或者，事实上，可能不仅仅是个探子，因为卡米撒派对上帝笃信不疑。这时我想到了一个故事，热沃当的伯爵带着一队龙骑兵，鞍前还跟着一个书记官，闯进每一个村庄，强迫村民们宣誓效忠。他们进入树林深处的一个山谷，发现卡瓦利埃和他的手下正在吃饭，他们欢乐地坐在草地上，帽子上戴着黄杨树花环，还有十五个女人在溪水中洗着他们的亚麻衣服。这是发生在1703年的一场野地狂欢。那时，安东尼.华托也在用类似的题材作画吧。","The position was unpleasantly exposed. One or two carts went by upon the road; and as long as daylight lasted I concealed myself, for all the world like a hunted Camisard, behind my fortification of vast chestnut trunk; for I was passionately afraid of discovery and the visit of jocular persons in the night. Moreover, I saw that I must be early awake; for these chestnut gardens had been the scene of industry no further gone than on the day before. The slope was strewn with lopped branches, and here and there a great package of leaves was propped against a trunk; for even the leaves are serviceable, and the peasants use them in winter by way of fodder for their animals. I picked a meal in fear and trembling, half lying down to hide myself from the road; and I daresay I was as much concerned as if I had been a scout from Joani’s1 band above upon the Lozère, or from Salomon’s2 across the Tarn, in the old times of psalm-singing and blood. Or, indeed, perhaps more; for the Camisards had a remarkable confidence in God; and a tale comes back into my memory of how the Count of Gévaudan, riding with a party of dragoons and a notary at his saddlebow to enforce the oath of fidelity in all the country hamlets, entered a valley in the woods, and found Cavalier and his men at dinner, gaily seated on the grass, and their hats crowned with box-tree garlands, while fifteen women washed their linen in the stream. Such was a field festival in 1703; at that date Antony Watteau3 would be painting similar subjects. "
"这次露营和昨晚在凉爽静谧的松林之中的露营大为不同。山谷中非常温暖，甚至有些闷热。太阳还没下山，就从河边传来了青蛙尖利的歌唱，歌声好似塞了一颗豌豆的哨子发出的颤音。在渐渐苍茫的暮色中，轻微的沙沙声在落叶间回荡；时不时地，一阵隐约的啁啁啾啾之声会传进我的耳中；而且我觉得可以看到栗子树间有迅捷模糊的影于不时地闪过。成群的大蚂蚁在地上爬着，蝙蝠飞掠而过，蚊子嗡嗡地在头顶盘旋。长长的树枝上垂下一簇簇树叶，在天空的映衬下，宛如一个个花环；而紧挨着我头顶和身边的那些枝叶，仿佛形成了一个棚架，大概是被一阵大风吹断耷拉下来的。","This was a very different camp from that of the night before in the cool and silent pine-woods. It was warm and even stifling in the valley. The shrill song of frogs, like the tremolo note of a whistle with a pea in it, rang up from the river-side before the sun was down. In the growing dusk, faint rustlings began to run to and fro among the fallen leaves; from time to time a faint chirping or cheeping noise would fall upon my ear; and from time to time I thought I could see the movement of something swift and indistinct between the chestnuts. A profusion of large ants swarmed upon the ground; bats whisked by, and mosquitoes droned overhead. The long boughs with their bunches of leaves hung against the sky like garlands; and those immediately above and around me had somewhat the air of a trellis which should have been wrecked and half overthrown in a gale of wind. "
"我很久都没有睡意；我刚刚开始感到安宁渐渐潜入我的四肢，并深深地进入我的意识的时候，头顶的一阵响动又惊得我睡意全无了，而且，我要坦率地承认，这让我的心都跳到嗓子眼里了。这声音好像是有人在用指甲刮擦着什么，发出很大的声响；它从被我当作枕头的背包下传来，我还没来得及坐起来查看四周，这声音已经响过三次了。我看不到有什么东西，也听不到其他的声音，只有这些神秘的沙沙声远远近近地传来，还和着河水和蛙声无休无止的伴奏。第二天我才知道，这片栗树园老鼠肆虐，这些沙沙声、啁啾声还有刮擦声应该都是这些老鼠造成的；但是这个谜题在当时那个时刻却是难以解开的，我只好尽量镇定下来继续睡觉，一边还在猜度着这些神秘的邻居。","Sleep for a long time fled my eyelids; and just as I was beginning to feel quiet stealing over my limbs, and settling densely on my mind, a noise at my head startled me broad awake again, and, I will frankly confess it, brought my heart into my mouth. It was such a noise as a person would make scratching loudly with a finger-nail; it came from under the knapsack which served me for a pillow, and it was thrice repeated before I had time to sit up and turn about. Nothing was to be seen, nothing more was to be heard, but a few of these mysterious rustlings far and near, and the ceaseless accompaniment of the river and the frogs. I learned next day that the chestnut gardens are infested by rats; rustling, chirping, and scraping were probably all due to these; but the puzzle, for the moment, was insoluble, and I had to compose myself for sleep, as best I could, in wondering uncertainty about my neighbours. "
"清晨（9月30日，礼拜一），天还灰蒙蒙的，我就被不远处石块上传来的脚步声惊醒了。睁开眼来，我看到一个农夫从我身旁经过，走在栗树间我之前没有看到的一条小路上。他目不斜视，几步就消失在枝叶间了。这里有条逃跑的小路！但是显然，逃离所需要的不仅仅是时间。到处都是农夫，他们对于无法解释清楚自己处境的我来说，所带来的恐惧完全不亚于普尔上尉带给一个无畏的卡米撒教徒的恐惧。我尽可能快地喂了小乖；但当我走回我的睡袋时，我看到一个男人和一个男孩从山坡上向我走了过来。他们嘟嘟囔囔地向我打了个招呼，我也用含混不清但很愉快的声音回应了他们，又匆匆系上绑腿。","I was awakened in the grey of the morning (Monday, 30th September) by the sound of foot-steps not far off upon the stones, and opening my eyes, I beheld a peasant going by among the chestnuts by a footpath that I had not hitherto observed. He turned his head neither to the right nor to the left, and disappeared in a few strides among the foliage. Here was an escape! But it was plainly more than time to be moving. The peasantry were abroad; scarce less terrible to me in my nondescript position than the soldiers of Captain Poul to an undaunted Camisard. I fed Modestine with what haste I could; but as I was returning to my sack, I saw a man and a boy come down the hillside in a direction crossing mine. They unintelligibly hailed me, and I replied with inarticulate but cheerful sounds, and hurried forward to get into my gaiters. "
"这两个人似乎是对父子，慢慢上到这块高地上，默默地在我身边站了一会儿。睡袋敞开着，我懊恼地看到我的左轮手枪公然暴露在蓝色的羊皮上。最终，在他们好好打量了我一番之后——而此时我们之间的沉默已经发展成为可笑的尴尬，男人用很不友好的语气问我：","The pair, who seemed to be father and son, came slowly up to the plateau, and stood close beside me for some time in silence. The bed was open, and I saw with regret my revolver lying patently disclosed on the blue wool. At last, after they had looked me all over, and the silence had grown laughably embarrassing, the man demanded in what seemed unfriendly tones:"
"“你睡在这里？”","“You have slept here?” "
"“是的，”我说，“正如你看到的这样。”","“Yes,” said I. “As you see.”"
"“为什么？”他问。","“Why?” he asked."
"“我保证，”我轻松地回答，“我当时累了。”","“My faith,” I answered lightly, “I was tired.”"
"他又问我要去哪里，晚饭都吃了些什么；然后，没有任何过渡地，“那好，”他说，“走吧。”之后，他和他儿子没有再说什么，转头走过我身旁的一棵栗树，来到下一棵栗树前，开始给它剪枝。事情就这么过去了，比我希望的还要简单。他是一位庄重可敬的人；他不友好的语气并不代表他认为自己在和一个罪犯说话，而只是觉得是在和一个下等人说话。","He next inquired where I was going and what I had had for dinner; and then, without the least transition, “C’est bien,” he added, “come along.” And he and his son, without another word, turned off to the next chestnut-tree but one, which they set to pruning. The thing had passed of more simply than I hoped. He was a grave, respectable man; and his unfriendly voice did not imply that he thought he was speaking to a criminal, but merely to an inferior. "
"我很快就上路了，一边啃着一块巧克力蛋糕，一边严肃地思考着一个关乎良心的问题。我要不要付晚间的住宿费呢？我睡得并不好，床上满是蚂蚁形状的跳蚤，卧室内没有水，破晓的第一缕晨光也没有在早晨把我叫醒。我很有可能会误了火车，如果附近有火车的话。很显然，我对受到的接待很不满意，因此我决定，除非碰到乞丐，否则我就不付钱了。","I was soon on the road, nibbling a cake of chocolate and seriously occupied with a case of conscience. Was I to pay for my night’s lodging? I had slept ill, the bed was full of fleas in the shape of ants, there was no water in the room, the very dawn had neglected to call me in the morning. I might have missed a train, had there been any in the neighbourhood to catch. Clearly, I was dissatisfied with my entertainment; and I decided I should not pay unless I met a beggar. "
"早晨的山谷看上去更加美丽；很快道路就降到和河流一般高度了。许多笔直茂盛的栗树站在一起，在长满青草的梯田上形成了一条走廊。在那里，我用塔恩河水洗漱了一番。河水极其清澈，而且冰凉沁骨。肥皂泡像变魔术般消失在湍急的河水里，白色的卵石让人明白了洁净的真正含义。在野外，在上帝众多河流中的一条里清洗自己，在我是种愉快而庄重的事，或是某种半异教徒的崇拜仪式。在卧室里的盆盆罐罐间洗浴可能可以洁净身体，但那种洗浴方式却无法获得精神上的洁净。我带着轻松宁静的心情又出发了，一边向前走，一边对上帝唱着赞美诗。","The valley looked even lovelier by morning; and soon the road descended to the level of the river. Here, in a place where many straight and prosperous chestnuts stood together, making an aisle upon a swarded terrace, I made my morning toilette in the water of the Tarn. It was marvellously clear, thrillingly cool; the soap-suds disappeared as if by magic in the swift current, and the white boulders gave one a model for cleanliness. To wash in one of God’s rivers in the open air seems to me a sort of cheerful solemnity or semi-pagan act of worship. To dabble among dishes in a bedroom may perhaps make clean the body; but the imagination takes no share in such a cleansing. I went on with a light and peaceful heart, and sang psalms to the spiritual ear as I advanced. "
"忽然走来了一位老妇人，她干脆直白地问我讨要施舍。","Suddenly up came an old woman, who point-blank demanded alms."
"“很好，”我想，“侍者带着账单来了。”","“Good,” thought I; “here comes the waiter with the bill.”"
"我马上付了我的房费。随你怎么想吧，但这是我在整个旅途中碰到的第一个也是最后一个乞丐。","And I paid for my night’s lodging on the spot. Take it how you please, but this was the first and the last beggar that I met with during all my tour. "
"又走了一两步，一位老汉赶上了我。他戴着棕色的睡帽，眼神清澈，饱经风霜，带着一丝激动的微笑。他身后跟着一个小姑娘，赶着两只绵羊和一只山羊；老汉和我并肩边走边聊着清晨和山谷的时候，她就一直紧紧跟着我们。现在六点刚过，对于刚刚睡饱的健康人来说，这是舒展身体的时刻，也是进行坦率诚恳的谈话的时刻。","A step or two farther I was overtaken by an old man in a brown nightcap, clear-eyed, weather-beaten, with a faint excited smile. A little girl followed him, driving two sheep and a goat; but she kept in our wake, while the old man walked beside me and talked about the morning and the valley. It was not much past six; and for healthy people who have slept enough, that is an hour of expansion and of open and trustful talk. "
"“你和主相识吗？”他最后用法语问道。","“Connaissez-vous le seigneur?” he said at length. "
"我问他他指的是哪位主；但他只是加重语气重复了这个问题，眼睛里流露出希望和关注。","I asked him what Seigneur he meant; but he only repeated the question with more emphasis and a look in his eyes denoting hope and interest. "
"“啊，”我说，往上指着，“我明白了。是的，我和主相识，主是我最熟识的人。”","“Ah,” said I, pointing upwards, “I understand you now. Yes, I know Him; He is the best of acquaintances.” "
"老汉说他很欣慰。“保持吧，”他又说，拍打着他的胸膛，“它让我这里很高兴。”这些山谷里有一些人与主相识，他接着告诉我；不多，但是有一些。“被召的人多，”他引用了一句《圣经》上的话，“选上的人少。”","The old man said he was delighted. “Hold,” he added, striking his bosom; “it makes me happy here.” There were a few who knew the Lord in these valleys, he went on to tell me; not many, but a few. “Many are called.” he quoted, “and few chosen.”4 "
"“老爹啊，”我说，“很难说谁和主相识；而且这也不关我们的事。新教徒和天主教徒，甚至那些崇拜石头的人，可能认识主，主也可能认识他们；因为主创造了一切。”","“My father,” said I, “it is not easy to say who know the Lord; and it is none of our business. Protestants and Catholics, and even those who worship stones, may know Him and be known by Him; for He has made all.” "
"我从不知道我还是一个这么好的传道者。","I did not know I was so good a preacher. "
"老汉向我保证说他也是这样想的，然后又一次表达了与我相遇的愉悦之情。“我们是这样少，”他说，“这里的人叫我们摩拉维亚派；但在加尔地区，那儿也有很多我们的教徒，他们根据一位英国牧师的名字，把我们叫做达秘派。”","The old man assured me he thought as I did, and repeated his expressions of pleasure at meeting me. “We are so few,” he said. “They call us Moravians5 here; but down in the Department of Gard, where there are also a good number, they are called Derbists6, after an English pastor.” "
"我开始明白过来，这位老汉以他令人怀疑的鉴别力，把我当成一个我没听说过的教派的一员了。但是，尽管因为未能及时表明我自己的真实身份而有些尴尬，我却更享受我给这位同伴带来的快乐。的确，我看不出不坦率承认自己的不同有什么不诚实之处；特别是在这些重要的问题上，我们都十分肯定，不管谁可能是错的，我们自己也不是完全正确的。关于真理的争论太多了；但这个戴着棕色睡帽的老汉是如此淳朴、亲切和友善，以至于要我皈依他的教派，我也并非不情愿。事实上，他是普利茅斯兄弟会的成员。对于他们的教义，我没有想要了解的念头，也没有时间了解；但我清楚地知道，我们都生在同一个艰难坎坷的世界上，都是同一位天父的子女，在众多实质性问题上努力做到一致或变成一样。尽管多少是出于误解，老汉才这样频繁地和我握手，表现得这样愿意接受我说的话，但这种误解的产生也可以归为探寻真理的一类。因为仁爱始于盲目；只有经过很多相似的误解，才能最终上升为一个固定的关于爱与忍耐的原则，以及对我们所有同胞的坚定信心。如果说我欺骗了这位善良的老人，我愿意以同样的方式继续欺骗其他人。而且如果，在各个走过各自悲伤的人生道路之后，我们最终都能一起进入那唯一的天堂，我衷心地希望，到那时我大山里的普利茅斯兄弟会跑过来跟我再次握手。","I began to understand that I was figuring, in questionable taste, as a member of some sect to me unknown; but I was more pleased with the pleasure of my companion than embarrassed by my own equivocal position. Indeed, I can see no dishonesty in not avowing a difference; and especially in these high matters, where we have all a sufficient assurance that, whoever may be in the wrong, we ourselves are not completely in the right. The truth is much talked about; but this old man in a brown nightcap showed himself so simple, sweet, and friendly, that I am not unwilling to profess myself his convert. He was, as a matter of fact, a Plymouth Brother7. Of what that involves in the way of doctrine I have no idea nor the time to inform myself; but I know right well that we are all embarked upon a troublesome world, the children of one Father, striving in many essential points to do and to become the same. And although it was somewhat in a mistake that he shook hands with me so often and showed himself so ready to receive my words, that was a mistake of the truth-finding sort. For charity begins blindfold; and only through a series of similar misapprehensions rises at length into a settled principle of love and patience, and a firm belief in all our fellow-men. If I deceived this good old man, in the like manner I would willingly go on to deceive others. And if ever at length, out of our separate and sad ways, we should all come together into one common house, I have a hope, to which I cling dearly, that my mountain Plymouth Brother will hasten to shake hands with me again. "
"于是，我们就这样一路像基督徒和忠信那样交谈着走下山来，来到塔恩河边的一个村庄。这是个简陋的地方，叫做拉凡尔奈德，只有大概十所房屋左右和一座建在小山上的新教礼拜堂。他就住在这儿，我在这里的小客栈里点了我的早餐。开店的是一位随和的年轻人，他是一名筑路碎石工；还有他的妹妹，一位俊俏迷人的姑娘。乡村小学的校长顺道进来和异乡人聊天。他们都是新教徒，这一事实带给我意想不到的愉悦。更让我高兴的是，他们看来都是些正直淳朴的人。那位普利茅斯兄弟带着热切的关心围着我走来走去，至少三次返回来问我饭菜是否可口。他的举动在当时使我深为感动，即使现在回忆起来，也还让我感怀不已。他不敢打扰，可一刻也不愿放过和我相伴的机会，而且他似乎对和我握手从来也不感到厌倦。","Thus, talking like Christian and Faithful8 by the way, he and I came down upon a hamlet by the Tarn. It was but a humble place, called La Vernède, with less than a dozen houses, and a Protestant chapel on a knoll. Here he dwelt; and here, at the inn, I ordered my breakfast. The inn was kept by an agreeable young man, a stone-breaker on the road, and his sister, a pretty and engaging girl. The village schoolmaster dropped in to speak with the stranger. And these were all Protestants—a fact which pleased me more than I should have expected; and, what pleased me still more, they seemed all upright and simple people. The Plymouth Brother hung round me with a sort of yearning interest, and returned at least thrice to make sure I was enjoying my meal. His behaviour touched me deeply at the time, and even now moves me in recollection. He feared to intrude, but he would not willingly forego one moment of my society; and he seemed never weary of shaking me by the hand. "
"当所有其他人都渐渐散去，开始他们一天的劳作之时，我坐着和这所房子的年轻女主人聊了近半个小时。她一边做着针线，一边愉快地和我谈起栗子丰收，塔恩河的美景，还有往日的家庭亲情，它因为年轻人离家外出而变淡了，但还维系着。我很肯定，她天性温柔，还有着乡村的朴实以及深藏其下的优雅；毫无疑问，能对她倾心相爱的人，一定是位幸运的小伙子。","When all the rest had drifted off to their day’s work, I sat for near half an hour with the young mistress of the house, who talked pleasantly over her seam of the chestnut harvest, and the beauties of the Tarn, and old family affections, broken up when young folk go from home, yet still subsisting. Hers, I am sure, was a sweet nature, with a country plainness and much delicacy underneath; and he who takes her to his heart will doubtless be a fortunate young man. "
"我越往前走，越陶醉于拉凡尔奈德下面山谷中的美景。时而是左右两边连绵拥来的山岭，光秃散乱，河流夹在两岸的绝壁中间；时而又是豁然开朗、绿草茵茵的山谷。顺着山路我经过峭壁上的米勒古堡；又经过一座筑有城垛的修道院，它很早之前就败落了，现在成了教堂和牧师住宅；还经过一片有着黑色房顶的房屋，那是科居勒斯村，坐落在众多葡萄园、草地和结满红苹果的果园之间。在靠近公路的地方，人们正在打落路边树上的胡桃，把它们装进袋子和篮子里面。不论河谷有多开阔，群山都是那么高峻荒凉，山上修着陡峭的城垛，不时还会耸出尖尖的山峰。塔恩河依旧从石间湍急地流过，发出轰鸣的声响。受那些思维古怪的行商们的影响，我以为将会看到一个拜伦所钟意的那种可怕村庄；但在我这双苏格兰人的眼睛看来，这里美好丰饶，正如这里的天气让我这个苏格兰人的身体感觉仍在盛夏；尽管栗子已在秋天被收完，而此地混杂于栗树之间的白杨，也因为冬天的临近而染上了淡金色。","The valley below La Vernède pleased me more and more as I went forward. Now the hills approached from either hand, naked and crumbling, and walled in the river between cliffs; and now the valley widened and became green. The road led me past the old castle of Miral on a steep; past a battlemented monastery, long since broken up and turned into a church and parsonage; and past a cluster of black roofs, the village of Cocurès, sitting among vineyards, and meadows, and orchards thick with red apples, and where, along the highway, they were knocking down walnuts from the roadside trees, and gathering them in sacks and baskets. The hills, however much the vale might open, were still tall and bare, with cliffy battlements and here and there a pointed summit; and the Tarn still rattled through the stones with a mountain noise. I had been led, by bagmen of a picturesque turn of mind, to expect a horrific country after the heart of Byron9; but to my Scottish eyes it seemed smiling and plentiful, as the weather still gave an impression of high summer to my Scottish body; although the chestnuts were already picked out by the autumn, and the poplars, that here began to mingle with them, had turned into pale gold against the approach of winter. "
"这片景色中有某种东西，尽管荒凉但却美好，为我诠释了南部国民誓约派成员的精神。那些受良心驱使而走入山间的苏格兰人思想阴郁痛苦，因为他们一旦接受了上帝的抚慰，就会加倍地投向撒旦的怀抱。而卡米撒派却只有欢快进取的幻想。他们多次浴血奋战，自己流血，也让敌人流血；但是在他们的历史记载中，我找不到对撒旦的迷恋。带着不是那么沉重的道德感，他们在那些艰难的时代和境遇下勇往直前。我们不能忘记，塞吉埃的灵魂就像花园一般。他们知道他们和上帝站在一边，怀着苏格兰人无法企及的见识；因为尽管苏格兰人对他们的理想非常坚定，却永远对人没信心。","There was something in this landscape, smiling although wild, that explained to me the spirit of the Southern Covenanters10. Those who took to the hills for conscience’ sake in Scotland had all gloomy and bedevilled thoughts; for once that they received God’s comfort they would be twice engaged with Satan; but the Camisards had only bright and supporting visions. They dealt much more in blood, both given and taken; yet I find no obsession of the Evil One in their records. With a light conscience, they pursued their life in these rough times and circumstances. The soul of Séguier, let us not forget, was like a garden. They knew they were on God’s side, with a knowledge that has no parallel among the Scots; for the Scots, although they might be certain of the cause, could never rest confident of the person."
"“我们飞翔，”一位年老的卡米撒派成员说，“当我们听到赞美诗的吟唱声时，我们就好像在展翅飞翔。我们心中感觉到一种勃发的热情，一种激狂的渴望。这种感觉无以言表，只有经历过才能够理解。不管有多疲倦，一听到赞美诗的歌声，我们就忘记了疲倦，一下子就感觉轻快起来。”","“We flew,” says one old Camisard, “when we heard the sound of psalm-singing, we flew as if with wings. We felt within us an animating ardour, a transporting desire. The feeling cannot be expressed in words. It is a thing that must have been experienced to be understood. However weary we might be, we thought no more of our weariness, and grew light so soon as the psalms fell upon our ears.”"
"塔恩河谷和我在拉凡尔奈遇到的人们不只为我解释了这段话，也解释了这些一旦投入战斗就坚决嗜杀的人们在二十年来以孩子般的顺从以及圣人和农夫的坚毅所忍受的苦难。","The valley of the Tarn and the people whom I met at La Vernède not only explain to me this passage, but the twenty years of suffering which those, who were so stiff and so bloody when once they betook themselves to war, endured with the meekness of children and the constancy of saints and peasants."
"14.弗洛拉克","XIV. Florac"
"弗洛拉克矗立在塔恩河的一条支流上，它是一个区的公署所在地，城里有一座古老的城堡，一条栽着悬铃木的小巷，很多古雅的街角，还有一股淙淙的泉水从山间流出。另外，此地还以美女闻名，同时还是卡米撒派活动的两个中心之一，另一个是阿莱斯。","On a branch of the Tarn stands Florac, the seat of a sub-prefecture, with an old castle, an alley of planes, many quaint street-corners, and a live fountain welling from the hill. It is notable, besides, for handsome women, and as one of the two capitals, Alais being the other, of the country of the Camisards. "
"吃过饭后，旅店主人就把我带到了临近的咖啡馆。在那里，我，更确切地说，是我的旅行，成了下午话题的中心。每个人都会指点我几句；这个区的地图也被从公署里拿了过来，在咖啡杯和酒杯间传来传去。大部分热心人是新教徒，但我发现，新教徒和天主教徒之间相处得非常融洽；而且，看到过去宗教战争的记忆仍然鲜活地留在人们的记忆里，真让我吃惊不小。在苏格兰西南山区，在莫赫林、卡姆诺克和卡斯费恩附近，在荒僻的农场或牧师住宅里，严肃的长老会教友仍然记得那段残酷的宗教迫害的日子，当地殉教者的坟墓也还被虔诚地照看着。但是在城里，在那些所谓的上层阶级里，恐怕那些昔日的事迹已成了闲暇时的谈资了。如果你在威格顿的“皇家卫队”酒馆看到一伙混杂的人群，他们的聊天是不太可能涉及国民誓约派的。不仅如此，在格伦卢斯的缪尔柯克，我发现牧师助理的妻子竟然从未听说过先知佩登的名字。但是在赛文山区，人们以先辈为荣的方式却与之完全不同。战争是他们必谈的话题；战争中的英勇事迹代表了他们独有的高贵之处；如果一个人或一个民族曾有过哪怕一次冒险行为，而那冒险又是英勇无畏的，我们就能料想得到、并且还要容忍在提及此事时言语上的些许冗长。他们告诉我，这个地区至今仍有很多未被收集的传说；我从他们那里听说卡瓦利埃的后代——不是直系后代，要知道，而只是表亲、堂亲或侄儿侄女什么的——仍然生活在这位少年将军浴血战斗过的地方，日子过得很丰裕；19世纪的一个下午，在祖先们曾经战斗过的旷野里，一位农夫曾经看见昔日战士的尸骨被挖出来，暴露在空气中，而这些曾孙辈的人们还在平静地挖掘着沟渠。","The landlord of the inn took me, after I had eaten, to an adjoining café, where I, or rather my journey, became the topic of the afternoon. Every one had some suggestion for my guidance; and the sub-prefectorial map was fetched from the sub-prefecture itself, and much thumbed among coffee-cups and glasses of liqueur. Most of these kind advisers were Protestant, though I observed that Protestant and Catholic intermingled in a very easy manner; and it surprised me to see what a lively memory still subsisted of the religious war. Among the hills of the south-west, by Mauchline, Cumnock, or Carsphairn1, in isolated farms or in the manse, serious Presbyterian people still recall the days of the great persecution, and the graves of local martyrs are still piously regarded. But in towns and among the so-called better classes, I fear that these old doings have become an idle tale. If you met a mixed company in the King’s Arms at Wigton, it is not likely that the talk would run on Covenanters. Nay, at Muirkirk of Glenluce, I found the beadle’s wife had not so much as heard of Prophet Peden Presbyterian2. But these Cévenols were proud of their ancestors in quite another sense; the war was their chosen topic; its exploits were their own patent of nobility; and where a man or a race has had but one adventure, and that heroic, we must expect and pardon some prolixity of reference. They told me the country was still full of legends hitherto uncollected; I heard from them about Cavalier’s descendants—not direct descendants, be it understood, but only cousins or nephews—who were still prosperous people in the scene of the boy-general’s exploits; and one farmer had seen the bones of old combatants dug up into the air of an afternoon in the nineteenth century, in a field where the ancestors had fought, and the great-grandchildren were peaceably ditching."
"那天晚些时候，一位新教牧师好意地拜访了我。他是一位聪明有礼的年轻人，我和他聊了一两个小时。他告诉我，弗洛拉克的教徒部分信仰新教，部分信仰天主教；而政治方面的分歧往往会使宗教方面的分歧成倍地加深。我从勒莫纳斯捷走来，那里纷争不休，好像炼狱般的波兰，现在却得知这里的人们平静地生活在一起，政治、宗教信仰都不同的家庭，居然还会热情相邀去彼此的家中作客，你可以想到我该有多惊讶吧。黑卡米撒派和白卡米撒派，民兵、非正规军战士和龙骑兵，新教先知和天主教白十字青年，他们都曾经历过马刀和火枪的搏斗，经历过焚烧、掠夺和杀戮，他们的心里曾满是愤慨；而在一百七十年后的这里，新教徒还是新教徒，天主教徒还是天主教徒，他们相互容忍，和睦地生活在一起。但是人类，就像养育了他的不屈不挠的大自然一样，有着自我疗伤的能力。岁月和四季带来各种收获；大雨过后，太阳重新升起；人类也从世俗的仇恨中一路走了出来，仿佛一个人从一天强烈的情感中醒了过来。我们从一个更加崇高的角度评判我们的祖先；现在，几个世纪的尘埃已经落下，我们也可以看到，当时的双方都拥有人类的德行，也都是为了正义而战。","Later in the day one of the Protestant pastors was so good as to visit me: a young man, intelligent and polite, with whom I passed an hour or two in talk. Florac, he told me, is part Protestant, part Catholic; and the difference in religion is usually doubled by a difference in politics. You may judge of my surprise, coming as I did from such a babbling purgatorial Poland of a place as Monastier, when I learned that the population lived together on very quiet terms; and there was even an exchange of hospitalities between households thus doubly separated. Black Camisard and White Camisard, militiaman and Miquelet and dragoon, Protestant prophet and Catholic cadet of the White Cross3, they had all been sabring and shooting, burning, pillaging, and murdering, their hearts hot with indignant passion; and here, after a hundred and seventy years, Protestant is still Protestant, Catholic still Catholic, in mutual toleration and mild amity of life. But the race of man, like that indomitable nature whence it sprang, has medicating virtues of its own; the years and seasons bring various harvests; the sun returns after the rain; and mankind outlives secular animosities, as a single man awakens from the passions of a day. We judge our ancestors from a more divine position; and the dust being a little laid with several centuries, we can see both sides adorned with human virtues and fighting with a show of right. "
"我从不认为公正是件容易的事情，而且日益发觉它比我料想的还要困难。我承认，见到这些新教徒令我非常愉快，有一种回家的感觉。我习惯于用他们的语言交谈，相对于英语和法语的区别，这种语言在一种更高的层面上区别于其他语言；因为真正的巴别塔指的是道德方面的分歧。因此比之天主教徒，我可以与新教徒进行更为自由的交流，也能更公正地评价他们。阿波利纳里斯神父和我那位山里的普利茅斯兄弟可以结成一对，他们都是正直虔诚的老人。但我还是会问我自己，我是否真的能衷心接受特拉普派教徒的种种德行呢？或者，如果我是一名天主教徒，我还会对拉凡尔奈德那些不赞成英国国教的新教徒感到如此亲切吗？对于前者，我仅仅抱着忍耐的态度，而对于后者，尽管是出于误解，谈的也是有选择的话题，我们之间还是可以进行交谈并交流一些诚实的想法的。在这个并非尽善尽美的世界上，即使是那些不完全的友爱之情，我们也应热诚地欢迎。而且，哪怕我们只能找到一个人让我们自由地倾吐心声，可以带着爱和单纯的心情结伴而行而毫无伪饰，我们就没有理由对这个世界或是上帝有什么怨言。","I have never thought it easy to be just, and find it daily even harder than I thought. I own I met these Protestants with a delight and a sense of coming home. I was accustomed to speak their language, in another and deeper sense of the word than that which distinguishes between French and English; for the true Babel is a divergence upon morals. And hence I could hold more free communication with the Protestants, and judge them more justly, than the Catholics. Father Apollinaris may pair off with my mountain Plymouth Brother as two guileless and devout old men; yet I ask myself if I had as ready a feeling for the virtues of the Trappist; or, had I been a Catholic, if I should have felt so warmly to the dissenter of La Vernede. With the first I was on terms of mere forbearance; but with the other, although only on a misunderstanding and by keeping on selected points, it was still possible to hold converse and exchange some honest thoughts. In this world of imperfection we gladly welcome even partial intimacies. And if we find but one to whom we can speak out of our heart freely, with whom we can walk in love and simplicity without dissimulation, we have no ground of quarrel with the world or God."
"15.在米芒特河谷","XV. In The Valley Of The Mimente"
"10月1日，礼拜二，我们，一头疲惫的驴子和一个疲惫的赶驴人，在下午晚些时候动身离开了弗洛拉克。朝塔尔农河上游走了不多久，一座木制棚桥把我们带进了米芒特山谷。陡峭多岩的红色山崖悬在河水上方；巨大的橡树和栗树长在山坡和多石的梯田上；环视四周，不时会有一片红色黍地或者几棵缀着红苹果的苹果树；道路紧挨着两个黑色的村落，其中一个村庄高处矗立着一座古堡，令旅人心情愉悦。","On Tuesday, 1st October, we left Florac late in the afternoon, a tired donkey and tired donkey-driver. A little way up the Tarnon, a covered bridge of wood introduced us into the valley of the Mimente. Steep rocky red mountains overhung the stream; great oaks and chestnuts grew upon the slopes or in stony terraces; here and there was a red field of millet or a few apple-trees studded with red apples; and the road passed hard by two black hamlets, one with an old castle atop to please the heart of the tourist."
"要在这里找到一处适合宿营的地方也很困难。即使在那些橡树和栗树下面，地面不只很陡，还堆满了松动的石块；而没有树的地方，石南丛生的红色悬崖向下倾斜，延伸到河流回荡着。太阳已经落到我面前最高那座山峰的下面去了，山谷中回荡着牧人呼唤牛羊归圈的低沉号角声。这时我看到路下方河流转弯处有一小块草地，就下到那里，把小乖暂且拴到树上，开始查看周围的环境。珍珠灰般的暮色弥漫在峡谷中；稍远处的景物变得模糊不清，在蒙眬中彼此融成一片；黑暗如雾气一般愈来愈浓。我走近草地上紧傍小河的一棵高大橡树，这时传来了一阵令我厌烦的孩子们的声音，于是发现对岸靠近转弯处有一所房屋。我颇有意整好行李离开此处，可是渐渐苍茫的暮色阻止了我。我只好静悄悄地呆在此处，等着夜色完全降临，同时指望晨光能早早把我唤醒。但在这样一个大客栈中，被邻居骚扰是不大可能的。","It was difficult here again to find a spot fit for my encampment. Even under the oaks and chestnuts the ground had not only a very rapid slope, but was heaped with loose stones; and where there was no timber the hills descended to the stream in a red precipice tufted with heather. The sun had left the highest peak in front of me, and the valley was full of the lowing sound of herdsmen’s horns as they recalled the flocks into the stable, when I spied a bight of meadow some way below the roadway in an angle of the river. Thither I descended, and, tying Modestine provisionally to a tree, proceeded to investigate the neighbourhood. A grey pearly evening shadow filled the glen; objects at a little distance grew indistinct and melted bafflingly into each other; and the darkness was rising steadily like an exhalation. I approached a great oak which grew in the meadow, hard by the river’s brink; when to my disgust the voices of children fell upon my ear, and I beheld a house round the angle on the other bank. I had half a mind to pack and be gone again, but the growing darkness moved me to remain. I had only to make no noise until the night was fairly come, and trust to the dawn to call me early in the morning. But it was hard to be annoyed by neighbours in such a great hotel."
"橡树下的一块洼地就是我的床榻。我还没有给小乖喂食，也没有整好我的睡袋，三颗星星就灿烂地亮起来了，其他星星也开始隐约出现。河水在礁石的映衬下显得黑沉沉的。我往下滑到河边，盛满我的水罐，在黑暗中津津有味地吃起了晚餐，因为我不敢在如此靠近房屋的地方点亮灯笼。整个下午我都看到的那弯苍白的新月，现在黯淡地照着群山山巅，但却没有一丝月光落到我栖身的峡谷深处。橡树在我面前肃立着，仿佛黑暗的支柱；头顶的群星在黑夜中欢快地闪烁着。法国人会快乐地说——没有“对着美丽的繁星”睡过的人，是不会了解这些星星的。他可能知道它们每一颗的名字、距离和亮度，却不会知晓那些独独与人类相关的好处——它们带给心灵的宁静与喜悦。诗歌中很大一部分是关于星星的；理应如此，因为它们本身就是第一流的诗人。这些同样遥远的世界，像点缀在夜空中的小蜡烛，又像遍撒空中的钻石粉尘，当时在罗兰或卡瓦利埃看来也并无二致，后者曾经写到，他们“只能以苍穹为篷，以大地为席。”","A hollow underneath the oak was my bed. Before I had fed Modestine and arranged my sack, three stars were already brightly shining, and the others were beginning dimly to appear. I slipped down to the river, which looked very black among its rocks, to fill my can; and dined with a good appetite in the dark, for I scrupled to light a lantern while so near a house. The moon, which I had seen , a pallid crescent, all afternoon, faintly illuminated the summit of the hills, but not a ray fell into the bottom of the glen where I was lying. The oak rose before me like a pillar of darkness; and overhead the heartsome stars were set in the face of the night. No one knows the stars who has not slept, as the French happily put it, à la belle étoile. He may know all their names and distances and magnitudes, and yet be ignorant of what alone concerns mankind—their serene and gladsome influence on the mind. The greater part of poetry is about the stars; and very justly, for they are themselves the most classical of poets. These same far-away worlds, sprinkled like tapers or shaken together like a diamond dust upon the sky, had looked not otherwise to Roland or Cavalier, when, in the words of the latter, they had “no other tent but the sky, and no other bed than my mother earth.” "
"整晚大风吹遍了山谷，树上的橡子噼噼啪啪地砸落在我身上。但是，在这十月的第一个夜晚，空气像五月那样温暖，我睡觉时，还把睡袋的毛皮掀了开来。","All night a strong wind blew up the valley, and the acorns fell pattering over me from the oak. Yet, on this first night of October, the air was as mild as May, and I slept with the fur thrown back."
"一只狗的叫声吵得我无法安眠，而我怕狗更甚于怕狼。狗比狼勇猛得多，此外，还有责任感在驱使着他。如果你杀了一头狼，迎接你的是鼓励和赞美；但如果你杀了一条狗，人们由于神圣的财产权和对家养动物的感情，就会围住你喧嚷不已，索要赔偿。经过了一天的疲累，尖厉凶猛的犬吠声本身就惹得人心烦意乱；而且对于我这样一个徒步旅行者来说，它将这个原本可敬的世界以最充满敌意的方式呈现了出来。这种迷人的动物身上有几分牧师或律师的气质；如果他面对石块的击打仍不顺服的话，最勇敢的旅行者也不敢徒步旅行了。我对家犬非常尊重，但如果是走在路上，或睡在田野中，我对它们真是又恨又怕。","I was much disturbed by the barking of a dog, an animal that I fear more than any wolf. A dog is vastly braver, and is besides supported by the sense of duty. If you kill a wolf, you meet with encouragement and praise; but if you kill a dog, the sacred rights of property and the domestic affections come clamouring round you for redress. At the end of a fagging day, the sharp cruel note of a dog’s bark is in itself a keen annoyance; and to a tramp like myself, he represents the sedentary and respectable world in its most hostile form. There is something of the clergyman or the lawyer about this engaging animal; and if he were not amenable to stones, the boldest man would shrink from travelling afoot. I respect dogs much in the domestic circle; but on the highway, or sleeping afield, I both detest and fear them."
"第二天早晨（10月2日，礼拜三），我被同一只狗的叫声吵醒了，我能认得他的声音。这狗冲到岸边，看到我坐起身来，又极其迅速地退了回去。群星还没有完全消失，清晨的天空呈现出微微的蓝灰色，极其妩媚动人。一缕静谧明亮的晨光洒下来，山坡上的树木在天空的映衬下露出清晰的轮廓。风更多地转向北方吹着，已经吹不到山谷中我的身上。我正在准备行程的时候，一片白云被风飞快地吹过山巅。看到染成金色的云朵我感到讶异极了。在这一带高空地区，太阳已经像正午那样光芒四射了。只要这些云飘得足够高，我们会整晚都看到与此时同样的景象。因为在太空中，一直都是白昼。","I was wakened next morning (Wednesday, October 2nd) by the same dog—for I knew his bark—making a charge down the bank, and then, seeing me sit up, retreating again with great alacrity. The stars were not yet quite extinguished. The heaven was of that enchanting mild grey-blue of the early morn. A still clear light began to fall, and the trees on the hillside were outlined sharply against the sky. The wind had veered more to the north, and no longer reached me in the glen; but as I was going on with my preparations, it drove a white cloud very swiftly over the hill-top; and looking up, I was surprised to see the cloud dyed with gold. In these high regions of the air, the sun was already shining as at noon. If only the clouds travelled high enough, we should see the same thing all night long. For it is always daylight in the fields of space. "
"我开始向上走出山谷的时候，一阵风从日出的地方吹了下来，尽管头上的云彩还在朝着几乎相反的方向疾驰。又往上走了几步，我看到整片山坡都被阳光镀上了金色；继续往上一点儿，在两座山峰之间，是一片炫丽夺目的光辉，其中心在空中漂浮，我又一次与这个位于太阳系中心的大火球面对面了。","As I began to go up the valley, a draught of wind came down it out of the seat of the sunrise, although the clouds continued to run overhead in an almost contrary direction. A few steps farther, and I saw a whole hillside gilded with the sun; and still a little beyond, between two peaks, a centre of dazzling brilliancy appeared floating in the sky, and I was once more face to face with the big bonfire that occupies the kernel of our system. "
"那天上午我只遇到了一个人，是一位黑黑的颇像军人的行人，肩头挂着一个猎物袋。但他说了一句话，颇值得一记。当我问他是新教徒还是天主教徒时——","I met but one human being that forenoon, a dark military-looking wayfarer, who carried a game-bag on a baldric; but he made a remark that seems worthy of record. For when I asked him if he were Protestant or Catholic—"
"“啊，”他说，“我从不以我的宗教为耻。我是天主教徒。”","“O,” said he, “I make no shame of my religion. I am a Catholic.” "
"他不以它为耻！这句话本身就是天然的数据资料，因为这是一位少数派的语言。我笑着，想起了巴维勒和他的龙骑兵，就算你用一个世纪来践踏一个地区的宗教，结果也只能让冲突更加严重。爱尔兰人依然信仰天主教；塞文山区的人们依然信仰新教。不论是满筐的法律文书，还是骑兵团的铁蹄和枪托，都无法改变庄稼汉一丁点儿的想法。野外耕作的乡下人没有多少思想，但是他们已经有的思想却是根深蒂固的，即使在遭到迫害时还是会茁壮地生长起来。一位长期在正午的辛勤汗水中和夜晚的星空下成长起来的人，一位山林的常客，一位诚实的乡下老人，最终会感到和宇宙万物的能量相通，并和他的上帝建立友好的联系。就像我那位山里的普利茅斯兄弟一样，他了解主。他的宗教并非建立在理性的选择之上；而是他人生阅历的诗歌，是他生活历史的哲学。上帝就像一股伟大的力量，一轮巨大而闪耀着的太阳，在这个单纯的人的一生中时时出现，成为他哪怕最细小思想的基础和精髓。如果你愿意，你可以通过权力改变宗教信条和教义，在号角声中宣称建立一种新的宗教；但在这里，这个人却有他自己的思想，而且不论是顺境还是逆境，都将坚定不移。他要么是天主教徒，要么是新教徒，或者普利茅斯兄弟会成员，这一事实就像男人不能是女人，或女人不能是男人那样不可更改。因为他不能变更他的信仰，除非他根除掉过去的全部记忆；并且按照严格而非传统的意义，他也不能改变思想。","He made no shame of it! The phrase is a piece of natural statistics; for it is the language of one in a minority. I thought with a smile of Bavile and his dragoons, and how you may ride rough-shod over a religion for a century, and leave it only the more lively for the friction. Ireland is still Catholic; the Cévennes still Protestant. It is not a basketful of law-papers, nor the hoofs and pistol-butts of a regiment of horse, that can change one tittle of a ploughman’s thoughts. Outdoor rustic people have not many ideas, but such as they have are hardy plants, and thrive flourishingly in persecution. One who has grown a long while in the sweat of laborious noons, and under the stars at night, a frequenter of hills and forests, an old honest countryman, has, in the end, a sense of communion with the powers of the universe, and amicable relations towards his God. Like my mountain Plymouth Brother, he knows the Lord. His religion does not repose upon a choice of logic; it is the poetry of the man’s experience, the philosophy of the history of his life. God, like a great power, like a great shining sun, has appeared to this simple fellow in the course of years, and become the ground and essence of his least reflections; and you may change creeds and dogmas by authority, or proclaim a new religion with the sound of trumpets, if you will; but here is a man who has his own thoughts, and will stubbornly adhere to them in good and evil. He is a Catholic, a Protestant, or a Plymouth Brother, in the same indefeasible sense that a man is not a woman, or a woman not a man. For he could not vary from his faith, unless he could eradicate all memory of the past, and, in a strict and not a conventional meaning, change his mind."
"16.地区中心","XVI. The Heart Of The Country"
"现在我离卡萨尼亚斯越来越近了。它坐落在一个荒凉的山谷里。山坡上，一片黑色的屋顶掩映在栗树园间，一片峭壁巉岩在清朗的蓝天下俯瞰着它。沿着米芒特河修建的山道依然很新，山里的人们还没有从看到此处第一辆马车的惊讶中恢复过来。尽管隔绝在世事之外，这个小村却早已在法国历史中占据了一席之地。在这附近，在山中的洞穴里，就有卡米撒派五个军火库中的一个；他们在那里贮存衣服、谷物和武器以备不时之需，还铸造刺刀和马刀，并把柳木炭和硝石放在锅里煮，自己制成火药。也是在这些山洞中，除了种种劳作，还有伤病员被带到这里养病疗伤；两位外科医生，夏布里埃和塔万，会来诊视，附近的妇女也会秘密前来照看他们。","I was now drawing near to Cassagnas, a cluster of black roofs upon the hillside, in this wild valley, among chestnut gardens, and looked upon in the clear air by many rocky peaks. The road along the Mimente is yet new, nor have the mountaineers recovered their surprise when the first cart arrived at Cassagnas. But although it lay thus apart from the current of men’s business, this hamlet had already made a figure in the history of France. Hard by, in caverns of the mountain, was one of the five arsenals of the Camisards; where they laid up clothes and corn and arms against necessity, forged bayonets and sabres, and made themselves gunpowder with willow charcoal and saltpetre boiled in kettles. To the same caves, amid this multifarious industry, the sick and wounded were brought up to heal; and there they were visited by the two surgeons, Chabrier and Tavan, and secretly nursed by women of the neighbourhood. "
"在卡米撒派划分的五大军团中，设在卡萨尼亚斯附近的这个军火库是最古老，也是最隐蔽的。他们是圣灵塞吉埃的队伍；在前去夜袭赛文山区大司祭的途中，这些人曾和他一起高唱《诗篇》第六十八章。塞吉埃升入天堂后，继任者是萨洛蒙·库代克，卡瓦利埃在他的回忆录里称其为整个卡米撒派军队的随军牧师长。他是位先知，可以洞悉人们的内心，通过“仔细观察每个人”的眉心，就可以决定是否接受他们参加圣礼；他还可以背诵《圣经》的大部分经文。这一点确实很幸运，因为在1703年8月遭受的一次奇袭中，他丢失了他的骡子、公文包和《圣经》。他们没有经常被奇袭，而且奇袭的效果也并不显著，倒也真是奇怪；因为卡萨尼亚斯这个军团在战争理论方面实行的是绝对的男权制，他们露营时不设岗哨，而是把这一职责交给了他们为之战斗的上帝的天使。这是一个象征，不仅体现了他们的信仰，也说明他们栖居的山区人迹罕至。在一个天气晴朗的日子，M·德卡拉东先生闲步山间，无意间走进了这伙人中，就好像走进了“草原上的羊群”里，发现一些人在睡觉，一些醒着，醒着的人在唱赞美诗。一个奸细，只要“会唱赞美诗”，无需介绍就可以潜入到他们之中；甚至先知萨洛蒙也会“以特别的情谊相待”。就这样，在萦纡的山林中，这支乡间部队存活了下来；可是除了圣礼和宗教狂喜之外，他们也没有太多的丰功伟绩可供青史记载。","Of the five legions into which the Camisards were divided, it was the oldest and the most obscure that had its magazines by Cassagnas. This was the band of Spirit Séguier; men who had joined their voices with his in the 68th Psalm as they marched down by night on the archpriest of the Cévennes. Séguier, promoted to heaven, was succeeded by Salomon Couderc, whom Cavalier treats in his memoirs as chaplain-general to the whole army of the Camisards. He was a prophet; a great reader of the heart, who admitted people to the sacrament or refused them, by “intensively viewing every man” between the eyes; and had the most of the Scriptures off by rote. And this was surely happy; since in a surprise in August 1703, he lost his mule, his portfolios, and his Bible. It is only strange that they were not surprised more often and more effectually; for this legion of Cassagnas was truly patriarchal in its theory of war, and camped without sentries, leaving that duty to the angels of the God for whom they fought. This is a token, not only of their faith, but of the trackless country where they harboured. M. de Caladon, taking a stroll one fine day, walked without warning into their midst, as he might have walked into “a flock of sheep in a plain,” and found some asleep and some awake and psalm-singing. A traitor had need of no recommendation to insinuate himself among their ranks, beyond “his faculty of singing psalms”; and even the prophet Salomon “took him into a particular friendship.” Thus, among their intricate hills, the rustic troop subsisted; and history can attribute few exploits to them but sacraments and ecstasies. "
"这些性格坚韧而淳朴的居民，正如我刚刚所说的，是不会随意改变他们的宗教信仰的；就算背教，他们也不会像乃缦那样只在临门神庙前做表面的服从。到路易十六颁布法令说，“鉴于一个世纪之久的迫害俱无效果，而且是出于必需而不是同情，”皇家终于赐予宗教宽容的时候，卡萨尼亚斯人仍然信仰新教；就个人而言，直至今日依然如此。固然，这儿有一户人家并非新教徒，但他们也不是天主教徒。那是一位反叛的天主教教区牧师，他与一位女教师倾心相爱。值得一提的是，他的行为受到了新教徒村民们的反对。","People of this tough and simple stock will not, as I have just been saying, prove variable in religion; nor will they get nearer to apostasy than a mere external conformity like that of Naaman1  in the house of Rimmon2. When Louis XVI., in the words of the edict, “convinced by the uselessness of a century of persecutions, and rather from necessity than sympathy,” granted at last a royal grace of toleration, Cassagnas was still Protestant; and to a man, it is so to this day. There is, indeed, one family that is not Protestant, but neither is it Catholic. It is that of a Catholic curé in revolt, who has taken to his bosom a schoolmistress. And his conduct, it is worth noting, is disapproved by the Protestant villagers. "
"“背弃他自己的承诺，”有人说，“这可是种坏思想。”","“It is a bad idea for a man,” said one, “to go back from his engagements.” "
"我所见到的这些村民，看起来都有着一种乡野化的智慧，而且举止质朴端庄。由于我是一名新教徒，大家都待我很亲切，而我对历史的熟知则更是为我赢得了尊重。因为我们在餐桌上展开了一场宗教辩论，和我一起用餐的那位警察和商人都不是本地人，而且都是天主教徒。店里的年轻人站在我们周围，并且支持我；辩论中人们的态度都很宽容，让我这个成长于充满琐细分歧和争执的苏格兰人大为惊诧。那位商人确实变得有点激动，而且远不像其他有些人那样欣赏我的历史知识。但那位警察，态度却非常从容平和。","The villagers whom I saw seemed intelligent after a countrified fashion, and were all plain and dignified in manner. As a Protestant myself, I was well looked upon, and my acquaintance with history gained me further respect. For we had something not unlike a religious controversy at table, a gendarme and a merchant with whom I dined being both strangers to the place, and Catholics. The young men of the house stood round and supported me; and the whole discussion was tolerantly conducted, and surprised a man brought up among the infinitesimal and contentious differences of Scotland. The merchant, indeed, grew a little warm, and was far less pleased than some others with my historical acquirements. But the gendarme was mighty easy over it all."
"“改变信仰这种想法太糟糕了，”他说，这个观点得到了大家的赞声。","“It’s a bad idea for a man to change,” said he; and the remark was generally applauded. "
"雪中圣母院的牧师和军人可不是这么想的。但在这里的是不同的一类人；也许当初促使他们奋起反抗的那份英勇豪迈，现在也能让他们以更加豁达的态度去对待分歧。因为勇士与勇士总是惺惺相惜的；而一旦信仰之光被扑灭，我们所看到的，就可能是一群卑劣狭隘的人了。布鲁斯和华莱士真正的功绩在于带来国家的统一；不是一直对立，双方在边界上冲突不断；而是当时机来临，他们可以带着自尊团结在一起。","That was not the opinion of the priest and soldier at Our Lady of the Snows. But this is a different race; and perhaps the same great-heartedness that upheld them to resist, now enables them to differ in a kind spirit. For courage respects courage; but where a faith has been trodden out, we may look for a mean and narrow population. The true work of Bruce3 and Wallace4 was the union of the nations; not that they should stand apart a while longer, skirmishing upon their borders; but that, when the time came, they might unite with self-respect. "
"商人对我的旅行很感兴趣，认为睡在野地里太危险了。","The merchant was much interested in my journey, and thought it dangerous to sleep afield. "
"“会有狼的，”他说，“还有，人们都知道你是个英国人。英国人的钱袋总是满满的，所以，很可能有人会想在某个晚上狠狠给你来上一下。”","“There are the wolves,” said he; “and then it is known you are an Englishman. The English have always long purses, and it might very well enter into some one’s head to deal you an ill blow some night.” "
"我告诉他我不怎么怕这类事情；而且，不管怎么说，每天提心吊胆，老想着生活中的小灾小难，是不明智的。我承认，生活本身总体上就是一件过于危险的事情，因此，那些额外的危险是不值得顾虑的。“如果你把自己牢牢锁在房间里，你身体里的某个东西，”我说，“可能在一礼拜里的任何一天破裂，然后你的生命就完结了。”","I told him I was not much afraid of such accidents; and at any rate judged it unwise to dwell upon alarms or consider small perils in the arrangement of life. Life itself, I submitted, was a far too risky business as a whole to make each additional particular of danger worth regard. “Something,” said I, “might burst in your inside any day of the week, and there would be an end of you, if you were locked into your room with three turns of the key.”"
"“可是，”他说，“睡在野地里！”","“Cependant,” said he, “Coucher dehors!”"
"“上帝无所不在。”我说。","“God,” said I, “is everywhere.”"
"“可是睡在野地里！”他重复着，声音中充满了恐惧。","“Cependant, coucher dehors!” he repeated, and his voice was eloquent of terror. "
"在我整个旅行中，他是唯一在如此简单的举动中看到艰险的人；尽管也有很多人认为这是没有必要的。而另一方面，也只有一个人，对这个念头欣喜不已；那人是我的普利茅斯兄弟，当我告诉他我有时更喜欢睡在星空下，而不是封闭吵闹的旅馆中，他大叫道：“现在我明白你与主相识了！”","He was the only person, in all my voyage, who saw anything hardy in so simple a proceeding; although many considered it superfluous. Only one, on the other hand, professed much delight in the idea; and that was my Plymouth Brother, who cried out, when I told him I sometimes preferred sleeping under the stars to a close and noisy ale-house, “Now I see that you know the Lord!” "
"我要离开的时候，商人向我要一张名片，因为他说我将来会成为人们津津乐道的人物，还要我把他的请求和理由记录下来，我就遵从了他的愿望。","The merchant asked me for one of my cards as I was leaving, for he said I should be something to talk of in the future, and desired me to make a note of his request and reason; a desire with which I have thus complied."
"两点刚过，我就跨过了米芒特河，顺着崎岖的山路向南攀上了一个山坡，山坡上到处是松动的石块和一簇簇的石南。就像在所有的乡村一样，小路在山顶处就消失了；我让母驴留在原处啃石南花，独自一人前去寻路。","A little after two I struck across the Mimente, and took a rugged path southward up a hillside covered with loose stones and tufts of heather. At the top, as is the habit of the country, the path disappeared; and I left my she-ass munching heather, and went forward alone to seek a road. "
"我现在正站在两大流域的分水岭上。在我身后，所有的河流都会流向加龙河和大西洋；我的前面是罗纳河流域。从这里，就像在洛泽尔一样，在晴朗的日子里，你可以看到闪闪发亮的里昂湾。说不定，萨洛蒙的士兵们就是在这里翘首盼望着克劳兹利·肖维尔爵士的船帆，以及早已承诺的英国援助物资。这道山脊可以看作是卡米撒派活动的中心地区，五大军团中的四个曾在这附近扎营，几乎可以彼此相望——萨洛蒙和若阿尼在北边，卡斯塔内和罗兰在南边。1703年，朱利安摧毁了整个塞文山区高地，十月和十一月整整两个月的时间里，四百六十个大小村庄被大火和铁镐夷为平地。在朱利安完成他的杰作之后，站在此处高地的人，看到的应该是一片死寂寥落、杳无人烟的土地。现在，时间和人类的活动已经重新修复了这片废墟；卡萨尼亚斯又建起了房屋，屋顶上又升起了炊烟；在栗树园里，在低矮的阴蔽角落里，富裕的农民们回家了，他们完成了一天的劳作，回到孩子们身边和明亮的炉火旁。尽管如此，这仍然可能是我在旅行中见过的最天然的景色。群山层峦叠嶂，一路绵延向南方，被冬天的溪流刻蚀出一道道沟壑，栗树漫山遍野，到处都是突兀的峭壁。太阳离落山还早，越过层层山巅，洒下淡淡的阳光，但是山谷早已陷入一片静寂无声的沉沉昏暗之中。","I was now on the separation of two vast water-sheds; behind me all the streams were bound for the Garonne and the Western Ocean; before me was the basin of the Rhone. Hence, as from the Lozère, you can see in clear weather the shining of the Gulf of Lyons; and perhaps from here the soldiers of Salomon may have watched for the topsails of Sir Cloudesley Shovel5, and the long-promised aid from England. You may take this ridge as lying in the heart of the country of the Camisards; four of the five legions camped all round it and almost within view—Salomon and Joani to the north, Castanet and Roland to the south; and when Julien had finished his famous work, the devastation of the High Cévennes, which lasted all through October and November 1703, and during which four hundred and sixty villages and hamlets were, with fire and pickaxe, utterly subverted, a man standing on this eminence would have looked forth upon a silent, smokeless, and dispeopled land. Time and man’s activity have now repaired these ruins; Cassagnas is once more roofed and sending up domestic smoke; and in the chestnut gardens, in low and leafy corners, many a prosperous farmer returns, when the day’s work is done, to his children and bright hearth. And still it was perhaps the wildest view of all my journey. Peak upon peak, chain upon chain of hills ran surging southward, channelled and sculptured by the winter streams, feathered from head to foot with chestnuts, and here and there breaking out into a coronal of cliffs. The sun, which was still far from setting, sent a drift of misty gold across the hill-tops, but the valleys were already plunged in a profound and quiet shadow."
"一位老态龙钟的牧羊人，拄着一对拐杖一瘸一拐地走来。他戴着一顶黑色的自由帽，仿佛是为了宣扬自己即将走向墓地。老人向我指明了前往圣日耳曼·德卡尔伯特的路。在这位老态龙钟的孤独老人身上，有某种庄严的气息。他住在哪里，是怎样爬上这高高的山脊，又打算如何下山，这些都是我无法想象的。我右边不远处就是著名的普朗·德丰·莫尔特高地，在那里，普尔用他的亚美尼亚军刀打垮了塞吉埃带领的卡米撒派。这位老人，在我看来，是一位战乱中的瑞普·凡·温克尔，失去了他的伙伴，在普尔的袭击中逃了出来，从那以后就在这山间游荡。卡瓦利埃已经投降了，而罗兰也已在一次战斗中背靠着一棵橄榄树倒下了。这些对他来说，都还是新闻吧。正当我任由思绪天马行空之际，我听到他结结巴巴地向我招呼，只见他挥舞着一根拐杖要我回去。这时我已经超过他往前走了一段了，但是，我还是又放开小乖，折了回去。","A very old shepherd, hobbling on a pair of sticks, and wearing a black cap of liberty, as if in honour of his nearness to the grave, directed me to the road for St. Germain de Calberte. There was something solemn in the isolation of this infirm and ancient creature. Where he dwelt, how he got upon this high ridge, or how he proposed to get down again, were more than I could fancy. Not far off upon my right was the famous Plan de Font Morte6, where Poul with his Armenian sabre slashed down the Camisards of Séguier. This, methought, might be some Rip van Winkle7 of the war, who had lost his comrades, fleeing before Poul, and wandered ever since upon the mountains. It might be news to him that Cavalier had surrendered, or Roland had fallen fighting with his back against an olive. And while I was thus working on my fancy, I heard him hailing in broken tones, and saw him waving me to come back with one of his two sticks. I had already got some way past him; but, leaving Modestine once more, retraced my steps. "
"唉，事情再普通不过了。这位老人忘记问小贩都是卖些什么，因此希望能弥补一下这个疏忽。","Alas, it was a very commonplace affair. The old gentleman had forgot to ask the pedlar what he sold, and wished to remedy this neglect. "
"我严肃地对他说：“什么都不卖。”","I told him sternly, “Nothing.” "
"“什么都不卖？”他喊道。","“Nothing?” cried he. "
"我重复道：“什么都不卖。”然后就走开了。","I repeated “Nothing,” and made off. "
"想来真是古怪，但是可能我就此成了老人的一个难解之谜，就像他之前给我的感觉一样。","It’s odd to think of, but perhaps I thus became as inexplicable to the old man as he had been to me. "
"山路掩在栗树的浓阴里，尽管我在下方的山谷里看到了一两个村落，还有栗农们许多单独的小屋，但是整个下午的旅程还是非常寂寞，而树阴下的夜晚也来得格外早。我听到不远处有一个女人的声音无休无止地唱着一首古老而哀婉的民谣。歌曲似乎是关于爱情和一个好情人，她那英俊的恋人。我走在昏暗的林间小路上，很想和着她的曲调对唱一番，像诗中的皮帕那样，把我的思绪和她的交织在一起。我能告诉她些什么呢？实在是很少；然而我的心里却全是这样的念头。造物总是赐予又夺走，让恋人们相聚一时，却是为了把他们重新分隔在遥远的异乡；但是爱情却是伟大的护身符，让这个世界变成了一座花园；而且，“人人都能拥有的希望”使我们熬过生命中的种种磨难，超脱了坟墓和死亡，最终落入颤抖的手中。说起来很轻巧：的确如此，但同样地，由于上帝的怜悯，信仰也是同样容易和值得感激的！","The road lay under chestnuts, and though I saw a hamlet or two below me in the vale, and many lone houses of the chestnut farmers, it was a very solitary march all afternoon; and the evening began early underneath the trees. But I heard the voice of a woman singing some sad, old, endless ballad not far off. It seemed to be about love and a bel amoureux, her handsome sweetheart; and I wished I could have taken up the strain and answered her, as I went on upon my invisible woodland way, weaving, like Pippa8 in the poem, my own thoughts with hers. What could I have told her? Little enough; and yet all the heart requires. How the world gives and takes away, and brings sweethearts near only to separate them again into distant and strange lands; but to love is the great amulet which makes the world a garden; and “hope, which comes to all,” outwears the accidents of life, and reaches with tremulous hand beyond the grave and death. Easy to say: yea, but also, by God’s mercy, both easy and grateful to believe!"
"我们最终踏上了一条宽阔的白色大路，上面覆着尘土，走上去悄无声响。夜晚来临了；月亮已经升起了很久，在对面的山上泛着银光；转过一个弯，驴子和我就走入她的光辉里了。早在弗洛拉克，我就喝光了白兰地，因为我实在是喝厌了它，然后换上了一些浓郁芬芳的沃尔内葡萄酒；此刻我就在路上，为月亮神圣的庄严而举杯。我只喝了几大口，然后就无法控制我的四肢，血液因为欢愉而快速涌动。就连小乖也被这纯洁的夜间光辉所感染，四个小蹄子迈得更加欢快了。山路在一片片栗树林间蜿蜒曲折，很快转为下坡。燥热的尘土自我们脚下扬起，又飘散开来。我们的影子——我的被背包压得变了形，她的却滑稽地驮着睡袋——一会儿清晰地映在道路的前方，一会儿又在转过弯后，突然变成远远的模糊的黑影，像云朵一样，沿着高山轻快地前行。时不时地，一阵暖风簌簌吹向谷中，所有的栗树立刻摇动起一簇簇枝叶和其间的果实；我的耳中满是低语般的音乐声，那些影子也仿佛随着乐声翩翩起舞。不久后微风远去了，山谷中的一切静止不动，只有我们的脚步还在不停地移动着。对面的山坡上，月光朦朦胧胧地勾勒出山间丘壑奇诡的形态；高高的头顶上，一所孤零零的房子里，一扇窗子亮着灯，方形的红红火光闪烁在这广阔的凄迷月色中。","We struck at last into a wide white high-road carpeted with noiseless dust. The night had come; the moon had been shining for a long while upon the opposite mountain; when on turning a corner my donkey and I issued ourselves into her light. I had emptied out my brandy at Florac, for I could bear the stuff no longer, and replaced it with some generous and scented Volnay; and now I drank to the moon’s sacred majesty upon the road. It was but a couple of mouthfuls; yet I became thenceforth unconscious of my limbs, and my blood flowed with luxury. Even Modestine was inspired by this purified nocturnal sunshine, and bestirred her little hoofs as to a livelier measure. The road wound and descended swiftly among masses of chestnuts. Hot dust rose from our feet and flowed away. Our two shadows—mine deformed with the knapsack, hers comically bestridden by the pack—now lay before us clearly outlined on the road, and now, as we turned a corner, went off into the ghostly distance, and sailed along the mountain like clouds. From time to time a warm wind rustled down the valley, and set all the chestnuts dangling their bunches of foliage and fruit; the ear was filled with whispering music, and the shadows danced in tune. And next moment the breeze had gone by, and in all the valley nothing moved except our travelling feet. On the opposite slope, the monstrous ribs and gullies of the mountain were faintly designed in the moonshine; and high overhead, in some lone house, there burned one lighted window, one square spark of red in the huge field of sad nocturnal colouring. "
"下山途中，转过几个急剧的弯，在某一个地方，月亮被山遮住了；我在一团漆黑中继续赶路，又转过一个弯，圣日耳曼·德卡尔伯特赫然出现在眼前。这地方已经陷入宁静的酣眠中了，朦胧的夜色笼罩着它。只从一扇开着的门中漏出一些灯光，映在路上，让我知道我已经来到人们聚居之处了。那天晚上的最后两个闲聊者还在花园的墙边聊天，他们为我指点了去旅馆的道路。女店主正打发孩子们上床睡觉；炉火已经熄灭了，店主人只好重新点着了它，嘴里少不了要抱怨几声；再晚上半个小时，我睡觉前就真的吃不上晚饭了。","At a certain point, as I went downward, turning many acute angles, the moon disappeared behind the hill; and I pursued my way in great darkness, until another turning shot me without preparation into St. Germain de Calberte. The place was asleep and silent, and buried in opaque night. Only from a single open door, some lamplight escaped upon the road to show me that I was come among men’s habitations. The two last gossips of the evening, still talking by a garden wall, directed me to the inn. The landlady was getting her chicks to bed; the fire was already out, and had, not without grumbling, to be rekindled; half an hour later, and I must have gone supperless to roost."
"17.最后一日","XVII. The Last Day "
"我在洁净舒适的卧室中醒来（10月2日，礼拜四），一阵高亢的鸡啼和母鸡心满意足的咯咯声，把我引到窗边，看到种满栗树的深谷中阳光灿烂。天色还早，拂晓的天色、斜照的阳光和长长的影子引得我走出房门，四处看看。","When I awoke (Thursday, 2nd October), and, hearing a great flourishing of cocks and chuckling of contented hens, betook me to the window of the clean and comfortable room where I had slept the night, I looked forth on a sunshiny morning in a deep vale of chestnut gardens. It was still early, and the cockcrows, and the slanting lights, and the long shadows encouraged me to be out and look round me. "
"圣日耳曼·德卡尔伯特是个大教区，方圆约九平方里格。战争期间，就在朱利安毁城之前，大概有二百七十五户人家定居于此，其中只有九家是天主教徒；为了做一次人口普查，教区牧师九月份要在马背上颠簸十七天去挨家挨户地查访。但是虽然是一个区的首府，这个地方本身并不比一个小村子大多少。它建在一个陡峭的山坡上，四周全是高大的栗树。新教礼拜堂在下面的山肩处，城中心有一个古雅的天主教堂。","St. Germain de Calberte is a great parish nine leagues round about. At the period of the wars, and immediately before the devastation, it was inhabited by two hundred and seventy-five families, of which only nine were Catholic; and it took the curé seventeen September days to go from house to house on horseback for a census. But the place itself, although capital of a canton, is scarce larger than a hamlet. It lies terraced across a steep slope in the midst of mighty chestnuts. The Protestant chapel stands below upon a shoulder; in the midst of the town is the quaint old Catholic church. "
"就是在这里，可怜的迪谢拉，那位天主教的殉道者，修建了藏书室，还组织了一个传教士法庭；在这里，他建造了自己的坟墓，以为会躺在一群充满感恩的人中间，因为是他把这些人从错误中救赎出来；也是在这里，在他死去的第二天，他们抬着他被刺了五十二处的尸体去埋葬。人们为他穿上祭司的长袍，把他庄重地摆放在教堂里。教区牧师引用《撒母耳记》下篇第二十章第十二节，“亚玛撒在道路上滚在自己的血里”，作了一篇激动人心的布道，号召他的教友们死在自己的岗位上，正如他们这位不幸而伟大的上级一样。就在牧师滔滔不绝之际，谣言传来，圣灵塞吉埃已经近在咫尺了；看吧！所有人都奔向他们的马匹，东的东，西的西，而那位教区牧师，已经远在阿莱了。","It was here that poor Du Chayla, the Christian martyr, kept his library and held a court of missionaries; here he had built his tomb, thinking to lie among a grateful population whom he had redeemed from error; and hither on the morrow of his death they brought the body, pierced with two-and-fifty wounds, to be interred. Clad in his priestly robes, he was laid out in state in the church. The curé, taking his text from Second Samuel, twentieth chapter and twelfth verse, “And Amasa wallowed in his blood in the highway,” preached a rousing sermon, and exhorted his brethren to die each at his post, like their unhappy and illustrious superior. In the midst of this eloquence there came a breeze that Spirit Séguier was near at hand; and behold! All the assembly took to their horses’ heels, some east, some west, and the curé himself as far as Alais. "
"这个小小的天主教教区的选址非常奇怪。这样一个针尖大的小小“罗马”，却处于疯狂的对立教派的包围之中。一方面，萨洛蒙的军团在卡萨尼亚斯监视着它；另一方面，米亚莱的罗兰军团切断了他的援兵路径。虽然教区牧师卢弗勒莱尼尔在大司祭的葬礼上受到惊吓，急匆匆溜到了阿莱，却还是稳稳地站在他那孤立无援的讲道坛后面，从那里发出了一篇篇声讨新教徒所犯罪恶的檄文。萨洛蒙把这个村子围了一个半小时，却被打退了。在夜里，人们可以听到站在牧师门前守卫的民兵们唱着天主教的赞美诗，与造反者友好地聊天。早晨的时候，尽管一枪未发，他们的火药桶中却不见一发弹药。它们去哪儿了呢？都作为报酬给了卡米撒派的士兵了。对这位孤立无援的牧师来说，他们是多么不可信任的守卫啊！","Strange was the position of this little Catholic metropolis, a thimbleful of Rome, in such a wild and contrary neighbourhood. On the one hand, the legion of Salomon overlooked it from Cassagnas; on the other, it was cut off from assistance by the legion of Roland at Mialet. The curé, Louvrelenil, although he took a panic at the arch-priest’s funeral, and so hurriedly decamped to Alais, stood well by his isolated pulpit, and thence uttered fulminations against the crimes of the Protestants. Salomon besieged the village for an hour and a half, but was beaten back. The militiamen, on guard before the curé’s door, could be heard, in the black hours, singing Protestant psalms and holding friendly talk with the insurgents. And in the morning, although not a shot had been fired, there would not be a round of powder in their flasks. Where was it gone? All handed over to the Camisards for a consideration. Untrusty guardians for an isolated priest! "
"如今很难想象圣日耳曼·德卡尔伯特那些持续骚乱动荡的日子；现在所有的一切都是如此宁静，在这个小小的山村里，人们生活的脉搏跳得低沉而缓慢。一些男孩子跟着我走了好长一段路，就像那些胆怯的猎狮人；我经过的时候，人们会扭过头来，或者从屋子中跑出来仔细打量我。可以想象，我的旅行是卡米撒派叛乱之后这里的第一个大事件。这种注视绝不含任何无礼鲁莽之意；而是一种愉快而好奇的审视，仿佛牛或者婴儿的注视打量；但是我还是被这种注视搞得筋疲力尽，逃离了街道。","That these continual stirs were once busy in St. Germain de Calberte, the imagination with difficulty receives; all is now so quiet, the pulse of human life now beats so low and still in this hamlet of the mountains. Boys followed me a great way off, like a timid sort of lion-hunters; and people turned round to have a second look, or came out of their houses, as I went by. My passage was the first event, you would have fancied, since the Camisards. There was nothing rude or forward in this observation; it was but a pleased and wondering scrutiny, like that of oxen or the human infant; yet it wearied my spirits, and soon drove me from the street. "
"我逃到了绿草如茵的阶地上，试图用铅笔描绘出栗树撑起绿叶华盖时那独特的丰姿。轻风不时拂过，栗子就落在我的四周，砸在草地上，发出轻微而沉闷的响声。这声音仿佛是大颗大颗的冰雹稀稀疏疏地落下，却让人愉快地联想到即将到来的丰收和为之庆祝的农夫们。抬起头来，我可以看到褐色的栗子正透过裂开口的果壳向外窥望；视线越过树干，看到的是山间栗树围成的圆形剧场，里面阳光充沛，绿叶婆娑。","I took refuge on the terraces, which are here greenly carpeted with sward, and tried to imitate with a pencil the inimitable attitudes of the chestnuts as they bear up their canopy of leaves. Ever and again a little wind went by, and the nuts dropped all around me, with a light and dull sound, upon the sward. The noise was as of a thin fall of great hailstones; but there went with it a cheerful human sentiment of an approaching harvest and farmers rejoicing in their gains. Looking up, I could see the brown nut peering through the husk, which was already gaping; and between the stems the eye embraced an amphitheatre of hill, sunlit and green with leaves. "
"我很少像这样深切地喜爱一个地方。我进入到一种美妙的境界，感到轻快、宁静而满足。但也许使我心情愉悦的不只是这个地方。也许在另一个国度有人在思念着我；或者可能在我不经意间，某些思绪来了又走了，但却使我受益匪浅。因为有些思绪，肯定是最美好的，但却在我们能够细细审视之前就溜走了；仿佛一位神祇，沿我们绿色的大路而来，却只是打开门，笑着往屋里瞧了一眼，然后又永远地离开了。它到底是阿波罗、墨丘利，还是折起翅膀的爱神？谁知道呢？但我们做起事情来心情却轻松了，心中也感到宁静安乐。","I have not often enjoyed a place more deeply. I moved in an atmosphere of pleasure, and felt light and quiet and content. But perhaps it was not the place alone that so disposed my spirit. Perhaps some one was thinking of me in another country; or perhaps some thought of my own had come and gone unnoticed, and yet done me good. For some thoughts, which sure would be the most beautiful, vanish before we can rightly scan their features; as though a god, travelling by our green highways, should but open the door, give one smiling look into the house, and go again for ever. Was it Apollo, or Mercury, or Love with folded wings? Who shall say? But we go the lighter about our business, and feel peace and pleasure in our hearts. "
"我和两个天主教徒一起吃的晚餐。他们一致指责一位年轻的天主教徒，因为他娶了一位信仰新教的姑娘，还皈依了他妻子的宗教。他们能够理解和尊重一位天生的新教徒；没错，他们似乎和一位信仰天主教的老妇人拥有同样的观念。就在同一天，老妇人告诉我说两个教派之间是没有区别的，除了“天主教徒犯错比新教徒犯错更加严重，”因为他们享有更多的光明和指引；然而此人的叛教行为却令他们深深蔑视。","I dined with a pair of Catholics. They agreed in the condemnation of a young man, a Catholic, who had married a Protestant girl and gone over to the religion of his wife. A Protestant born they could understand and respect; indeed, they seemed to be of the mind of an old Catholic woman, who told me that same day there was no difference between the two sects, save that “wrong was more wrong for the Catholic,” who had more light and guidance; but this of a man’s desertion filled them with contempt. "
"“改变宗教是个糟糕的念头。”一个人说。","“It is a bad idea for a man to change,” said one."
"这也许是巧合，但看看这句话是如何纠缠着我的吧；就我个人而言，我认为这是这些地区的普遍观点。我很难想出比这更好的观点。当一个人改变他的宗教，并以上帝的名义脱离他的家庭，不仅极大地伤害了人们对他的信任，而且其可能的结果会是——不仅如此，我们也希望——虽然在世人眼中他作了巨大的改变，但在上帝的眼中却没有一丁点儿的变化。让我们向那些作出此等改变的人致敬，因为这种转变极其痛苦。但是它也暴露了这些人的狭隘之处，不论他们是强者还是弱者，是先知还是愚人，因为他们对这些细枝末节的人为活动居然表现出这样浓厚的兴趣，居然可以为了一种不太可靠的思想转变而放弃友谊。而且我认为，我不应该放弃我原有的信条去改信另外一个，这仅仅是字眼上的改变；而应该通过一些大胆的见解，在精神上真正地信奉它，发现我们所犯的过错，这些过错对我来说是错误的，而对于其他教派中最虔诚的信徒来说同样也是错误的。","It may have been accidental, but you see how this phrase pursued me; and for myself, I believe it is the current philosophy in these parts. I have some difficulty in imagining a better. It’s not only a great flight of confidence for a man to change his creed and go out of his family for heaven’s sake; but the odds are—nay, and the hope is—that, with all this great transition in the eyes of man, he has not changed himself a hairbreadth to the eyes of God. Honour to those who do so, for the wrench is sore. But it argues something narrow, whether of strength or weakness, whether of the prophet or the fool, in those who can take a sufficient interest in such infinitesimal and human operations, or who can quit a friendship for a doubtful process of the mind. And I think I should not leave my old creed for another, changing only words for other words; but by some brave reading, embrace it in spirit and truth, and find wrong as wrong for me as for the best of other communions. "
"周围地区正在害葡萄根瘤蚜病；午饭时我们没有喝葡萄酒，而是喝了一种更为经济的葡萄汁，他们叫它“巴黎姑娘”。酿制它时，人们把水果整个放入装着水的木桶里，然后这些浆果会一个个发酵、胀破。夜里在水中酿好的饮料，白天就可以喝了。所以，只需不断从井里打来一罐罐清水，然后一个个葡萄相继爆裂，释放出它的能量。一桶“巴黎姑娘”可以让一家人一直喝到春天。读者可以想见，这是一种味道非常淡的饮料，但是却很可口。","The phylloxera1 was in the neighbourhood; and instead of wine we drank at dinner a more economical juice of the grape—La Parisienne, they call it. It is made by putting the fruit whole into a cask with water; one by one the berries ferment and burst; what is drunk during the day is supplied at night in water: so, with ever another pitcher from the well, and ever another grape exploding and giving out its strength, one cask of Parisienne may last a family till spring. It is, as the reader will anticipate, a feeble beverage, but very pleasant to the taste."
"由于吃了午饭，喝了咖啡，我离开圣日耳曼·德卡尔伯特的时候，早已过了下午三点了。我沿着米亚莱的加尔东河下山，那是一条闪闪发光的无水河道，然后穿过法兰西谷的圣艾蒂安，或者像他们过去习惯的那样称它为弗朗西斯克谷；傍晚时开始攀登又高又陡的圣皮埃尔山。一辆要返回圣让迪加尔的空马车紧跟在我身后，在快到山顶的时候赶上了我。赶车人像其他所有人一样，确信我是一名小贩；但跟其他人不同的是，他很肯定我要卖的是什么。他注意到从我行李两边垂下来的蓝色羊皮；从这一点上他就认定，我做的是蓝羊皮领圈的生意，比如用来装饰法国役马脖子的那些东西。我无论如何都没法改变他的这个判断。","What with dinner and coffee, it was long past three before I left St. Germain de Calberte. I went down beside the Gardon of Mialet, a great glaring watercourse devoid of water, and through St. Etienne de Vallée Francaise, or Val Francesque, as they used to call it; and towards evening began to ascend the hill of St. Pierre. It was a long and steep ascent. Behind me an empty carriage returning to St. Jean du Gard kept hard upon my tracks, and near the summit overtook me. The driver, like the rest of the world, was sure I was a pedlar; but, unlike others, he was sure of what I had to sell. He had noticed the blue wool which hung out of my pack at either end; and from this he had decided, beyond my power to alter his decision, that I dealt in blue-wool collars, such as decorate the neck of the French draught-horse. "
"我催赶着小乖让她尽可能地快走，因为我非常渴望能在日落前欣赏一下另一边的景色。但是我到达山顶时夜色已经降临了；明亮的月亮高高地悬在天边，只有西边还残留着几缕暗淡的暮光。山谷裂着大口，沉浸在黑暗中，像一个人造的坑洞躺在我的脚下；但群山的轮廓在天空的映衬下却格外清晰。那里有埃戈阿尔山，卡斯塔内的据点。而卡斯塔内在卡米撒派中值得一提，不只因为他是活跃的革命领袖，还因为他的桂冠上带着些玫瑰色彩。他证明了，即使是在一场公众悲剧中，爱情仍是不可阻止的。在战争高潮时期，他在山中的大本营里迎娶了一位年轻美丽的姑娘，玛丽埃特。人们为此大事欢宴；新郎还释放了二十五名战俘以庆祝他们的喜事。七个月后，人们戏称为“塞文山区公主”的玛丽埃特落入了当局者之手，可能遭到了严酷的折磨。但卡斯塔内也不是等闲之辈，而且非常爱他的妻子。他攻入了瓦勒罗格，从那里掠走了一位贵妇人当作人质。于是，在那场战争中，双方第一次也是最后一次彼此交换了俘虏。他们的女儿，埃戈阿尔山上某个星夜里的爱情结晶，至今仍有后代。","I had hurried to the topmost powers of Modestine, for I dearly desired to see the view upon the other side before the day had faded. But it was night when I reached the summit; the moon was riding high and clear; and only a few grey streaks of twilight lingered in the west. A yawning valley, gulfed in blackness, lay like a hole in created nature at my feet; but the outline of the hills was sharp against the sky. There was Mount Aigoal, the stronghold of Castanet. And Castanet, not only as an active undertaking leader, deserves some mention among Camisards; for there is a spray of rose among his laurel; and he showed how, even in a public tragedy, love will have its way. In the high tide of war he married, in his mountain citadel, a young and pretty lass called Mariette. There were great rejoicings; and the bridegroom released five-and-twenty prisoners in honour of the glad event. Seven months afterwards, Mariette, the Princess of the Cévennes, as they called her in derision, fell into the hands of the authorities, where it was like to have gone hard with her. But Castanet was a man of execution, and loved his wife. He fell on Valleraugue, and got a lady there for a hostage; and for the first and last time in that war there was an exchange of prisoners. Their daughter, pledge of some starry night upon Mount Aigoal, has left descendants to this day. "
"我和小乖在圣皮埃尔山顶上草草吃了些东西——这是我们在一起的最后一餐。我坐在一堆石块上，她站在我旁边，在月光下文雅地吃着我手中的面包。这头可怜的牲口以这种方式会吃得香甜一些，因为她已经对我产生了一定的依恋之情，而我却很快就要背叛她的感情了。","Modestine and I—it was our last meal together—had a snack upon the top of St. Pierre, I on a heap of stones, she standing by me in the moonlight and decorously eating bread out of my hand. The poor brute would eat more heartily in this manner; for she had a sort of affection for me, which I was soon to betray. "
"到圣让迪加尔有一段很长的下山路，我们一路上一个人也没遇见，除了一位运货的马车夫。月光照在他熄灭了的灯笼上，闪闪发亮，离得很远了还看得到。","It was a long descent upon St. Jean du Gard, and we met no one but a carter, visible afar off by the glint of the moon on his extinguished lantern. "
"不到十点我们就到了目的地，还吃上了晚餐。我们只花了六个小时多一点就走了十五英里的路程，还翻越了一座陡峭的小山！","Before ten o’clock we had got in and were at supper; fifteen miles and a stiff hill in little beyond six hours!"
"18.再见，小乖！","XVIII. Farewell, Modestine!"
"10月3日早晨，经过检查，有人告诉我，小乖不再适合继续旅行了。一位马夫说她至少需要休息两天；但我现在急着去阿莱取我的信件；而且因为身处拥有驿站马车的文明国家，我决定卖掉我的雌性朋友，当天下午乘驿站马车离开。我们昨天的旅行，加上在圣皮埃尔山追了好久才追上我们的马车夫的证词，使得关于我的驴子能力的有利消息流传开来。有意购买的人们意识到这是一个千载难逢的良机。十点没到，就有人出价二十五法郎；经过激烈的讨价还价，我在中午前以三十五法郎卖掉了小乖，包括驮鞍和所有的配件。金钱上的收益并不明显，但这场交易让我买回了自由。","On examination, on the morning of October 3rd, Modestine was pronounced unfit for travel. She would need at least two days’ repose, according to the ostler; but I was now eager to reach Alais for my letters; and, being in a civilised country of stage-coaches, I determined to sell my lady friend and be off by the diligence that afternoon. Our yesterday’s march, with the testimony of the driver who had pursued us up the long hill of St. Pierre, spread a favourable notion of my donkey’s capabilities. Intending purchasers were aware of an unrivalled opportunity. Before ten I had an offer of twenty-five francs; and before noon, after a desperate engagement, I sold her, saddle and all, for five-and-thirty. The pecuniary gain is not obvious, but I had bought freedom into the bargain. "
"圣让迪加尔是个大地方，大部分居民都是新教徒。那里的市长是一名新教徒，他请我在一件小事上帮个忙，而这件小事本身正体现了这个地区的特色。塞文山区的年轻姑娘们，得益于共同的宗教和不同的语言，很多都去了英国做家庭教师；现在这里就有一位米亚莱姑娘，正为来自伦敦两家不同机构的信件而苦恼。我尽自己所能帮了忙，还主动给了些我认为绝妙的建议。","St. Jean du Gard is a large place, and largely Protestant. The maire, a Protestant, asked me to help him in a small matter which is itself characteristic of the country. The young women of the Cévennes profit by the common religion and the difference of the language to go largely as governesses into England; and here was one, a native of Mialet, struggling with English circulars from two different agencies in London. I gave what help I could; and volunteered some advice, which struck me as being excellent. "
"我还记下了一件事。在附近的葡萄园里葡萄根瘤蚜肆虐；大清早，我发现一群人在河边的栗子树下摆弄苹果压榨机。我一开始搞不明白他们在做些什么，就请其中一位为我解释一下。","One thing more I note. The phylloxera has ravaged the vineyards in this neighbourhood; and in the early morning, under some chestnuts by the river, I found a party of men working with a cider-press. I could not at first make out what they were after, and asked one fellow to explain. "
"“做苹果酒呀，”他说，“是的，就是这样，就像在北方那样。”","“Making cider,” he said. “Oui, c’est comme ca. Comme dans le Nord!” "
"他的话里带着某种嘲讽：这个地方就要完蛋了。","There was a ring of sarcasm in his voice: the country was going to the devil."
"直到我稳稳地坐在车夫旁边，马车嘎嘎地驶过一个布满石块、长着低矮的橄榄树的山谷时，我才意识到我的失落。我失去了小乖。那一刻之前我一直以为自己恨她，但现在她不见了。","It was not until I was fairly seated by the driver, and rattling through a rocky valley with dwarf olives, that I became aware of my bereavement. I had lost Modestine. Up to that moment I had thought I hated her; but now she was gone."
"“啊！我的世界全变了！”","“And, O! The difference to me!”1"
"十二天以来，我们一直都是形影不离的同伴；我们攀登了一百二十英里的山路，越过了几座巍峨的山岭，我们的六条腿跋涉在许多布满岩石和沼泽的小道上。在第一天之后的时间里，尽管有时我感到伤心，对她很冷淡，但还是保持着耐心；而她呢，可怜的家伙！她已经把我当作她的神灵了。她喜欢在我的手里吃东西。她很乖，体态优雅，有着完美的老鼠般的毛色，而且小巧得无与伦比。她的缺点是她那个物种和性别所共有的，而她的优点却是她自己独有的。再见了，而且如果这是永别——","For twelve days we had been fast companions; we had travelled upwards of a hundred and twenty miles, crossed several respectable ridges, and jogged along with our six legs by many a rocky and many a boggy by-road. After the first day, although sometimes I was hurt and distant in manner, I still kept my patience; and as for her, poor soul! she had come to regard me as a god. She loved to eat out of my hand. She was patient, elegant in form, the colour of an ideal mouse, and inimitably small. Her faults were those of her race and sex; her virtues were her own. Farewell, and if for ever—"
"把小乖卖给我的时候，亚当老爹流泪了；而我卖掉她之后，也忍不住要像他那样了；我和驿站的车夫以及四五个讨人喜欢的年轻人坐在一起，还是感到孤零零的，就不管不顾地流下泪来。","Father Adam wept when he sold her to me; after I had sold her in my turn, I was tempted to follow his example; and being alone with a stage-driver and four or five agreeable young men, I did not hesitate to yield to my emotion."
"1.“啊！我的世界全变了！”，引自华兹华斯（1770—1850）的诗《她住在无人迹的小路旁》。",""
