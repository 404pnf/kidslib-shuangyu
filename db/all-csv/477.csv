"“你要去何方？”“去瓦尔佩。”“我去瓦尔佩，你也去瓦尔佩，好，好，我们一块去。”","“Whither goest thou?”“To Walpe.”“I to Walpe, thou to Walpe, so, so, together we’ll go.”"
"“你结婚了吗？爱人叫什么？”“夏姆。”“我的爱人叫夏姆，你的爱人也叫夏姆；我去瓦尔佩，你也去瓦尔佩；好，好，我们一块去。”“你有小孩吗？小孩叫什么？”“维尔德。”“我家小孩叫维尔德，你家小孩也叫维尔德；我的爱人叫夏姆，你的爱人也叫夏姆；我去瓦尔佩，你也去瓦尔佩，好，好，我们一块去。”“你家有摇篮吗？摇篮叫什么？”“希波戴德。”“我家的摇篮叫希波戴德，我家小孩叫维尔德，你家小孩也叫维尔德；我的爱人叫夏姆，你的爱人也叫夏姆；我去瓦尔佩，你也去瓦尔佩，好，好，我们一块去。”","“Hast thou a man?What is his name?”“Cham.”“My man Cham, thy man Cham; I to Walpe, thou to Walpe; so, so, together we’ll go.”“Hast thou a child; how is he styled?”“Wild.”“My child Wild, thy child Wild; my man Cham, thy man Cham; I to Walpe, thou to Walpe, so, so, together we’ll go.”“Hast thou a cradle?How callest thou thy cradle?”“Hippodadle.”“My cradle Hippodadle, my child Wild, thy child Wild, my man Cham, thy man Cham; I to Walpe, thou to Walpe, so, so, together we’ll go.”"

"特露德夫人","Frau Trude"
"从前有个小女孩，她十分倔强，对什么事物都十分好奇，当她父母叫她做事情时，她总是不听他们的话，那么她又怎么会有好下场呢？一天，她对父母说：“我听到了很多有关特露德夫人的事情，我想哪天去找她。大家都说有关她的一切看起来都很古怪，她的房子里有非常稀奇古怪的东西，我非常好奇！”她的父母极力表示反对，对她说：“特鲁露夫人是个坏女人，专做坏事儿，如果你去找她，那么我们就不再认你这个女儿了。”但是小女孩儿没有因为父母禁止就改变想法，她仍然去找了特露德夫人。当她找到特露德夫人时，特露德夫人说：“为什么你脸色苍白？”“啊，”她全身颤抖着回答道，“我刚看到了一些东西，吓死我了。”“你看到什么了？”“我看见你家台阶上有个黑人。”“那是矿工。”“然后我看见一个绿色的人。”“那是猎人。”“在那之后我看见了一个血红色的人。”“那是屠夫。”“啊，特露德夫人，吓死我了；我透过窗户没看到你，但是，我很肯定看到了头颅是一团火的魔鬼。”“啊哈！”她说，“那么你看到的是身着巫服的女巫。我一直在等你，已经等了你好长时间了；你应该给我一些光。”然后她把这个小女孩变成了一块木头，将其扔进火里。火熊熊燃烧，她在旁边坐下取暖，说：“从某种程度上来说，这火也只会燃烧一次。”","There was once a little girl who was obstinate and inquisitive, and when her parents told her to do anything, she did not obey them, so how could she fare well?One day she said to her parents, “I have heard so much of Frau Trude, I will go to her some day.People say that everything about her does look so strange, and that there are such odd things in her house, that I have become quite curious!”Her parents absolutely forbade her, and said, “Frau Trude is a bad woman, who does wicked things; and if thou goest to her, thou art no longer our child.”But the maiden did not let herself be turned aside by her parent’s prohibition, and still went to Frau Trude.And when she got to her, Frau Trude said, “Why art thou so pale?”“Ah,” she replied, and her whole body trembled, “I have been so terrified at what I have seen.”“What hast thou seen?”“I saw a black man on your steps.”“That was a collier.”“Then I saw a green man.”“That was a huntsman.”“After that I saw a blood-red man.”“That was a butcher.”“Ah, Frau Trude, I was terrified; I looked through the window and saw not you, but, as I verily believe, the devil himself with a head of fire.”“Oho!” said she, “then thou hast seen the witch in her proper costume.I have been waiting for thee, and wanting thee a long time already; thou shalt give me some light.”Then she changed the girl into a block of wood, and threw it into the fire.And when it was in full blaze she sat down close to it, and warmed herself by it, and said, “That shines bright for once in a way.”"
"克诺斯特和他的三个儿子","Knoist and his Three Sons"
"在维勒尔和索斯特之间住着一个名叫克诺斯特的男人。这个人有三个儿子。一个是瞎子，一个是瘸子，另一个赤裸着身子。一天，他们三人经过野地，看到了一只野兔。瞎子射中了它，瘸子逮住了它，赤裸着身子的人把它放进了口袋里。然后他们来到了一条大河边，河上有三条船，一条起航了，一条下沉了，一条没有底。他们都上了那条没底的船。然后他们来到了一片很大的森林里，森林中有一棵高大的树；树上有座宏伟的教堂；教堂里有山毛榉司事和黄杨木牧师，他俩用粗短棍洒圣水。","Between Werrel and Soist there lived a man whose name was Knoist, and he had three sons.One was blind, the other lame, and the third stark-naked.Once on a time they went into a field, and there they saw a hare.The blind one shot it, the lame one caught it, the naked one put it in his pocket.Then they came to a mighty big lake, on which there were three boats, one sailed, one sank, the third had no bottom to it.They all three got into the one with no bottom to it.Then they came to a mighty big forest in which there was a mighty big tree; in the tree was a mighty big chapel; in the chapel was a sexton made of beech-wood and a box-wood parson, who dealt out holy-water with cudgels."
"多开心啊，能避开这圣水的人！","“How truly happy is that one Who can from holy water run!”"
"线头的故事","Odds And Ends"
"以前有一个女孩，人长得很美，但是特别懒惰，还很粗枝大叶。每当她不得不纺线的时候，她都会发脾气。只要麻线上结了一个小疙瘩，她马上就会把一整团线从纺织机里拽出来，然后胡乱扔在地上。然而她的女仆却十分勤劳。她把主人丢弃的麻线收集起来，加以清洗，纺成上好的线，又用这些线为自己做了一件美丽的礼服。一个年轻人向这个懒女孩求婚了，他们的婚礼很快就要举行。婚礼前一天晚上，勤劳的女仆穿着她美丽的礼服，兴高采烈地跳着舞。新娘子看见了就说：","There was once on a time a maiden who was pretty, but idle and negligent.When she had to spin she was so out of temper that if there was a little knot in the flax, she at once pulled out a whole heap of it, and strewed it about on the ground beside her.Now she had a servant who was industrious, and gathered together the bits of flax which were thrown away, cleaned them, span them fine, and had a beautiful gown made out of them for herself.A young man had wooed the lazy girl, and the wedding was to take place.On the eve of the wedding, the industrious one was dancing merrily about in her pretty dress, and the bride said,—"
"“哟，这女仆穿着我的破线头，跳得还真欢快。”","“Ah, how that girl does jump about, dressed in my odds and ends.”"
"新郎官听到了，就问她这话是什么意思。新娘子告诉他，这个女孩身上的礼服，是用她扔掉的麻线做成的。新郎官听到这些，知道了新娘子很懒惰，而这个穷女仆却很勤劳。他离开了新娘子，来到女仆身边，娶她做了自己的妻子。","The bridegroom heard that, and asked the bride what she meant by it?Then she told him that the girl was wearing a dress make of the flax which she had thrown away.When the bridegroom heard that, and saw how idle she was, and how industrious the poor girl was, he gave her up and went to the other, and chose her as his wife."
"有福同享，有难同当","Sharing Joy and Sorrow"
"从前有个裁缝，喜欢跟人吵嘴。他有个妻子，心肠好，又勤快又虔诚，却一直不得他的欢心。不管她做什么，他总是不满意，而且又是抱怨又是责骂，对她拳打脚踢。最后官府听说了，就把他传唤去，并送进监狱，以使他改过自新。他在监狱里粗茶淡饭地呆了些日子，然后被放了出来。但是，他被要求发誓，以后再也不打妻子，而是要和她和气地过日子，有福同享，有难同当，像个夫妻的样子。和和气气地过了一段时间后，他的老毛病又犯了，脾气暴躁，没事找事。由于他不敢打妻子，于是就拽住她的头发往下扯。妻子从他身边逃开，冲到院子里，可他却拿起码尺和剪刀追着她跑来跑去。他边追还边将码尺和剪刀或手边的任何东西扔向妻子。要是砸到妻子，他就大笑，要是没砸到，就咆哮起来，咒骂妻子。他一直不停地这样追打，最后邻居们都过来帮助妻子了。这个裁缝又被传唤到官府，法官提醒他想想自己的誓言。“尊敬的阁下，”他说，“我遵守了我的誓言，我没有打她，我只是和她有福同享有难同当。”“这怎么可能，”法官说，“她不是不断地向你提出强烈抗议吗？”“我没有打她，只是因为她看起来太古怪了，我想给她梳理梳理头发而已。可她却抛开我，心怀怨恨地跑掉了。于是我就去追她，为了让她回来尽职。我将手边的东西扔向她是好意的劝谏。而且我和她也是有福同享有难同当，因为每当我砸到她我就开心，她就痛苦；如果我没砸中她，那她就庆幸，我就难过了。”但法官们并不满意于他的回答，因此给了他应得的报应。","There was once a tailor, who was a quarrelsome fellow, and his wife, who was good, industrious, and pious, never could please him.Whatever she did, he was not satisfied, but grumbled and scolded, and knocked her about and beat her.As the authorities at last heard of it, they had him summoned, and put in prison in order to make him better.He was kept for a while on bread and water, and then set free again.He was forced, however, to promise not to beat his wife any more, but to live with her in peace, and share joy and sorrow with her, as married people ought to do.All went on well for a time, but then he fell into his old ways, and was surly and quarrelsome.And because he dared not beat her, he would seize her by the hair and tear it out.The woman escaped from him, and sprang out into the yard, but he ran after her with his yard-measure and scissors, and chased her about, and threw the yard-measure and scissors at her, and whatever else came his way.When he hit her he laughed, and when he missed her, he stormed and swore.This went on so long that the neighbors came to the wife’s assistance.The tailor was again summoned before the magistrates, and reminded of his promise.“Dear gentlemen,” said he, “I have kept my word, I have not beaten her, but have shared joy and sorrow with her.”“How can that be,” said the judge, “when she continually brings such heavy complaints against you?”“I have not beaten her, but just because she looked so strange I wanted to comb her hair with my hand; she, however, got away from me, and left me quite spitefully.Then I hurried after her, and in order to bring her back to her duty, I threw at her as a well-meant admonition whatever came readily to hand.I have shared joy and sorrow with her also, for whenever I hit her I was full of joy, and she of sorrow, and if I missed her, then she was joyful, and I sorry.”The judges were not satisfied with this answer, but gave him the reward he deserved."
"老太太","The Aged Mother"
"在一个大镇子里住着一位老太太。一天夜里，她独自坐在屋子里，回忆着过往。想起自己起初是如何失去了丈夫，接着又失去了两个孩子，后来所有的亲人又一个接一个地去世。最终，她的最后一个朋友也在今天离开了她。现在，她孤身一人，境况凄凉。她十分难过。对她来说，最沉重的打击莫过于失去了两个儿子。她很痛苦，便把这一切都归罪于上帝。她还坐在那儿，沉浸在自己的思绪中。突然，她听到早晨祷告的钟声。她很惊讶，自己竟然如此悲伤，一整晚都没合眼。然后，她点上提灯去了教堂。她到教堂时，里面已经亮了，但与往常不同的是，那光亮不是烛光，而是微弱的阳光。教堂里已经挤满了人，所有的座位都坐满了；她走到她常坐的位子，那儿也有已经人占了，而且整个长凳上没有一点空位。她看了看那些人，发现他们正是自己已故的亲人。他们坐在那儿，穿着旧式衣服，脸色苍白。他们既没有说话，也没有唱圣歌，但整个教堂却充满着轻柔的嗡嗡声和耳语声。她的一位姨妈起身走过来，对这可怜的老太太说：“看着祭坛旁边，你会看到你的儿子们。”老太太往那边看，果然看到了她的两个孩子，一个被吊在绞刑架上，另一个被绑在刑轮上。然后，那位姨妈说：“你看，如果他们还活着，如果仁慈的上帝没有在他们还是纯真的孩子时把他们带离人世，他们就会落得这样的下场。”老太太颤抖着回了家，她双膝跪地，感谢上帝对她的仁慈，虽然她曾经一度无法理解。第二天，老太太就寿终正寝了。","In a large town there was an old woman who sat in the evening alone in her room thinking how she had lost first her husband, then both her children, then one by one all her relations, and at length, that very day, her last friend, and now she was quite alone and desolate.She was very sad at heart, and heaviest of all her losses to her was that of her sons; and in her pain she blamed God for it.She was still sitting lost in thought, when all at once she heard the bells ringing for early prayer.She was surprised that she had thus in her sorrow watched through the whole night, and lighted her lantern and went to church.It was already lighted up when she arrived, but not as it usually was with wax candles, but with a dim light.It was also crowded already with people, and all the seats were filled; and when the old woman got to her usual place it also was not empty, but the whole bench was entirely full.And when she looked at the people, they were none other than her dead relations who were sitting there in their old-fashioned garments, but with pale faces.They neither spoke nor sang; but a soft humming and whispering was heard all over the church.Then an aunt of hers stood up, stepped forward, and said to the poor old woman, “Look there beside the altar, and thou wilt see thy sons.”The old woman looked there, and saw her two children, one hanging on the gallows, the other bound to the wheel.Then said the aunt, “Behold, so would it have been with them if they had lived, and if the good God had not taken them to himself when they were innocent children.”The old woman went trembling home, and on her knees thanked God for having dealt with her more kindly than she had been able to understand, and on the third day she lay down and died."
"桌子上的面包渣","The Crumbs on the Table"
"有一天，一个农夫对他的小狗们说：“到客厅去享乐吧，去捡桌上的面包渣，你们的女主人出门做客去了。”小狗们说：“不，不，我们不去。要是女主人知道了，会打我们的。”农夫说：“她不会知道的。来吧，反正她也从来不给你们好吃的。”小狗们还是说：“不行，不行，我们不能动面包屑，我们不能去。”但农夫吵得它们不得安宁，最后小狗们都到桌子上去，并敞开肚皮吃光了面包渣。但正在这时，女主人回来了。她飞快地抓起棍子，严厉地鞭打、处罚它们。在屋外，小狗们对农夫说：“瞧瞧，瞧见没？”这时农夫大笑道：“噢，噢，你们没料到吗？”小狗们只好跑开了。","A countryman one day said to his little puppies, “Come into the parlour and enjoy yourselves, and pick up the bread-crumbs on the table; your mistress has gone out to pay some visits.”Then the little dogs said, “No, no, we will not go.If the mistress gets to know it, she will beat us.”The countryman said, “She will know nothing about it.Do come; after all, she never gives you anything good.”Then the little dogs again said, “Nay, nay, we must let it alone; we must not go.”But the countryman let them have no peace until at last they went, and got on the table, and ate up the bread-crumbs with all their might.But at that very moment the mistress came, and seized the stick in great haste, and beat them and treated them very hardly.And when they were outside the house, the little dogs said to the countryman, “Dost, dost, dost, dost, dost thou see?”Then the countryman laughed and said, “Didn’t, didn’t, didn’t, you expect it?”So they just had to run away."
"聪敏的小裁缝","The Cunning Little Tailor"
"从前有一位公主，她特别骄傲。如果有人来向她求婚，她总要给人出个谜语来猜，要是他猜不出，她就会轻蔑地把他赶走。她宣称，不管他是什么人，只要能猜出她的谜语，就可以娶她。终于有一天，三个裁缝偶然碰到了一起。两个年长的裁缝认为自己曾成功地做过那么多灵巧的针线活，若去求婚肯定也能成功。而第三个裁缝是个一无是处的流浪汉，连自己的本行都不懂，但他想去冒险碰碰运气，不然运气还能从何而来？于是，两个年长的裁缝对小裁缝说：“在家呆着吧，你懂的不多，去了也做不了什么。”然而，小裁缝并没有就此气馁，他说自己早就渴望能赌上一把，而且应该能应付自如，之后他就动身出发了，仿佛全世界都尽在自己的掌控中。","There was once on a time a princess who was extremely proud.If a wooer came she gave him some riddle to guess, and if he could not find it out, he was sent contemptuously away.She let it be made known also that whosoever solved her riddle should marry her, let him be who he might.At length, therefore, three tailors fell in with each other, the two eldest of whom thought they had done so many dexterous bits of work successfully that they could not fail to succeed in this also; the third was a little useless land-louper, who did not even know his trade, but thought he must have some luck in this venture, for where else was it to come from?Then the two others said to him, “Just stay at home; thou canst not do much with thy little bit of understanding.”The little tailor, however, did not let himself be discouraged, and said he had set his head to work about this for once, and he would manage well enough, and he went forth as if the whole world were his."
"他们三个都去公主那儿报到了，说她该给他们出谜语，因为最适合的人选就在她眼前，他们的心思比针眼还要细密。于是，公主说：“我头上有两种头发，它们是什么颜色的？”“如果就是这个问题，”第一个裁缝说，“那一定是黑色和白色，就像黑白相间的芝麻布布料一样。”公主说：“猜错了，第二个来回答吧。”于是第二个人说：“如果不是黑色和白色，那么就是棕色和红色，就像我父亲待客时穿的衣服一样。”“猜错了，”公主说，“让第三个来回答吧，因为我看得出他似乎有了确定的答案。”于是，小裁缝大胆地走向前说：“公主的头上有银色和金色的头发，这就是公主头发的两种不同颜色。”公主一听，吓得面色苍白，几乎要瘫倒在地，因为小裁缝猜中了她的谜语，她原本坚信这个世界上没人能找到谜底。当她回过神来，她说：“单凭这件事，你还不能算赢了我，还有一件事情你必须做到。下面的马厩里有只熊，你得和它共度一个晚上，如果第二天早上我起床时你还活着，我就嫁给你。”不管怎样，她期待这次能摆脱这个小裁缝，因为这只熊从不会让落入它掌中的任何人活着出来。小裁缝没有被吓跑，反倒十分开心地说道：“敢于冒险就成功了一半。”","They all three announced themselves to the princess, and said she was to propound her riddle to them, and that the right persons were now come, who had understandings so fine that they could be threaded in a needle.Then said the princess, “I have two kinds of hair on my head, of what color is it?”“If that be all,” said the first, “it must be black and white, like the cloth which is called pepper and salt.”The princess said, “Wrongly guessed; let the second answer.”Then said the second, “If it be not black and white, then it is brown and red, like my father’s company coat.”“Wrongly guessed,” said the princess, “let the third give the answer, for I see very well he knows it for certain.”Then the little tailor stepped boldly forth and said, “The princess has a silver and a golden hair on her head, and those are the two different colors.”When the princess heard that, she turned pale and nearly fell down with terror, for the little tailor had guessed her riddle, and she had firmly believed that no man on earth could discover it.When her courage returned she said, “Thou hast not won me yet by that; there is still something else that thou must do.Below, in the stable is a bear with which thou shalt pass the night, and when I get up in the morning if thou art still alive, thou shalt marry me.”She expected, however, she should thus get rid of the tailor, for the bear had never yet left any one alive who had fallen into his clutches.The little tailor did not let himself be frightened away, but was quite delighted, and said, “Boldly ventured is half won.”"
"于是，夜幕降临时，小裁缝被带到了熊那里。熊正准备要袭击这个小个子，用爪子给他一个热情的“欢迎”，小裁缝连忙说：“轻点儿，轻点儿，我会马上让你安静下来。”然后，他非常沉着地从口袋里掏出一些坚果，去了果核，吃起了果仁，好像根本没什么要担心的事。熊见了，也很想吃些坚果。小裁缝把手伸进口袋，抓出一把给它，但那不是坚果，而是鹅卵石。熊把它们放进嘴里，拼命地咬，却怎么也咬不开。“啊！”熊想，“我多么蠢啊！我连坚果都咬不开！”于是它对小裁缝说：“给，帮我弄开它。”“瞧，你多笨啊！”小裁缝说，“有着那么大一张嘴，竟咬不开一个小小的坚果！”然后他接过石头，迅速地换成了个坚果放进了嘴里，咬了一下，坚果分成了两半！“我要再试一次，”熊说道，“看着你咬，我想我应该也能咬开。”于是小裁缝又给了熊一颗鹅卵石，熊试了一次又一次，用尽了全身力气想咬开它。但是，谁都想不到它居然咬开了。这之后，小裁缝从他的外套下拿出一把小提琴，独自弹奏了一曲。熊一听到音乐，就情不自禁地跳起了舞，跳了一会儿之后，它高兴地对小裁缝说：“喂，拉琴难吗？”“太容易了，连小孩子都会。瞧，左手手指按弦，右手拉弓，琴弦就欢快地跳跃啦，hopsasa vivallalera。”（hopsasa vivallalera应为小裁缝跟随乐曲随意哼唱的词。）“那么，”熊说道，“小提琴也是我能学会的东西啦，这样，我什么时候想跳舞都可以了。你觉得这主意怎样？你能教我吗？”“十分乐意，”小裁缝说，“如果你有此天赋的话。”但是让我先看看你的爪子，它们太长了，我必须把它们剪短一点。”随后，他拿来一把老虎钳，熊把爪子放在里面，小裁缝将它拧紧了，说：“你先等着，我去拿把剪刀。”然后，他就躺到屋角的干草堆上睡着了，任凭熊在一旁拼命咆哮。","When therefore the evening came, our little tailor was taken down to the bear.The bear was about to set at the little fellow at once, and give him a hearty welcome with his paws: “Softly, softly,” said the little tailor, “I will soon make thee quiet.”Then quite composedly, and as if he had not an anxiety in the world, he took some nuts out of his pocket, cracked them, and ate the kernels.When the bear saw that, he was seized with a desire to have some nuts too.The tailor felt in his pockets, and reached him a handful; they were, however, not nuts, but pebbles.The bear put them in his mouth, but could get nothing out of them, let him bite as he would.“Eh!” thought he, “what a stupid blockhead I am!I cannot even crack a nut!” and then he said to the tailor, “Here, crack me the nuts.”“There, see what a stupid fellow thou art!” said the little tailor, “to have such a great mouth, and not be able to crack a small nut!”Then he took the pebble and nimbly put a nut in his mouth in the place of it, and crack, it was in two!“I must try the thing again,” said the bear; “when I watch you, I then think I ought to be able to do it too.”So the tailor once more gave him a pebble, and the bear tried and tried to bite into it with all the strength of his body.But no one will imagine that he accomplished it.When that was over, the tailor took out a violin from beneath his coat, and played a piece of it to himself.When the bear heard the music, he could not help beginning to dance, and when he had danced a while, the thing pleased him so well that he said to the little tailor, “Hark you, is the fiddle heavy?”“Light enough for a child.Look, with the left hand I lay my fingers on it, and with the right I stroke it with the bow, and then it goes merrily, hopsasa vivallalera!”“So,” said the bear; “fiddling is a thing I should like to understand too, that I might dance whenever I had a fancy.What dost thou think of that?Wilt thou give me lessons?”“With all my heart,” said the tailor, “if thou hast a talent for it.But just let me see thy claws, they are terribly long, I must cut thy nails a little.”Then a vise was brought, and the bear put his claws in it, and the little tailor screwed it tight, and said, “Now wait until I come with the scissors,” and he let the bear growl as he liked, and lay down in the corner on a bundle of straw, and fell asleep."
"夜里，公主听到熊咆哮得那么凶猛，她只以为是熊把小裁缝吃了，正高兴地大叫呢。早上，她轻松愉快地起了床，但是当她朝马厩偷看时，小裁缝却得意地站在她面前，活蹦乱跳得就像水里的鱼一样。事到如今，她也说不出什么来反对这门婚事了，因为她曾在众人面前许下过诺言。于是国王派来了一辆马车，她只得和小裁缝驾着它去教堂举行婚礼。他们刚坐进马车，另外那两个心怀不轨的裁缝因为嫉妒小裁缝的好运气，就跑去马厩把熊放了出来。熊愤怒地追着马车。公主听到了熊的怒吼和咆哮，吓得尖叫起来：“天啊，那只熊在后面追我们，它要抓你！”小裁缝急中生智，双脚倒立，将腿伸出窗外，喊道：“你看见老虎钳了吗？如果你再不走，我又要拿老虎钳来夹你了。”熊一看到这个，就立即掉头跑了。小裁缝稳稳地驾着车来到教堂，立刻与公主举行了婚礼，从此二人像森林云雀般过上了幸福美好的生活。任何不相信这个故事的人都必须支付一泰勒（德国旧银币）。","When the princess heard the bear growling so fiercely during the night, she believed nothing else but that he was growling for joy, and had made an end of the tailor.In the morning she arose careless and happy, but when she peeped into the stable, the tailor stood gaily before her, and was as healthy as a fish in water.Now she could not say another word against the wedding because she had given a promise before every one, and the King ordered a carriage to be brought in which she was to drive to church with the tailor, and there she was to be married.When they had got into the carriage, the two other tailors, who had false hearts and envied him his good fortune, went into the stable and unscrewed the bear again.The bear in great fury ran after the carriage.The princess heard him snorting and growling; she was terrified, and she cried, “Ah, the bear is behind us and wants to get thee!”The tailor was quick and stood on his head, stuck his legs out of the window, and cried, “Dost thou see the vise?If thou dost not be off thou shalt be put into it again.”When the bear saw that, he turned round and ran away.The tailor drove quietly to church, and the princess was married to him at once, and he lived with her as happy as a woodlark.Whosoever does not believe this, must pay a thaler."

"从前，有一只牧羊犬，它的主人对它不好，而且总让它挨饿。它在主人身边再也呆不下去了，便十分难过地离开了。路上，它遇见了一只麻雀，麻雀说：“狗兄弟，你为什么这么悲伤呢？”牧羊犬回答道：“我很饿，又没东西吃。”麻雀又说：“亲爱的兄弟，跟我一起进城吧，我会让你填饱肚子的。”于是它们一起进了城。到了一间肉铺前，麻雀对狗说道：“你呆在那儿，我去给你衔一点肉来。”然后，麻雀就落在那肉摊上，环视四周，确定没有人注意到它后，便又是啄、又是拉、又是扯的，终于，一片放在案边的肉滑落了下来。接着，狗就叼住那块肉，跑进一个角落，狼吞虎咽地把肉吃了。那麻雀又说道：“现在再跟我去另一家店，我再给你弄块肉，这样你应该就饱了。”当狗把第二块肉也吞下去之后，麻雀问道：“狗兄弟，现在你吃饱了吧？”“嗯，肉我已经吃够了，”狗回答道，“但是我还没有吃到面包呢。”麻雀说道：“你也能吃到面包的，跟我来吧。”然后麻雀就把狗带到一家面包店里，啄着两个小圆面包，直到它们滚落下来。狗还想要更多的面包，麻雀又带它去了另一个摊位，并且也给它弄了些面包。狗吃完面包以后，麻雀问：“狗兄弟，现在你吃饱了吗？”“吃饱了。”狗回答说，“现在我们去城外散会儿步吧。”然后它们一起出了城，走到了公路上。但那天很暖和，它们才走了没多远，狗就说：“我累了，想睡会儿觉。”“好吧，那你睡吧。”麻雀回答道，“你睡觉的时候，我就在树枝上坐着好了。”于是狗便躺在了路上，很快就睡着了。当狗在那儿睡觉的时候，一个车夫驾着车路过，那车由三匹马拉着，车上装了两桶葡萄酒。然而麻雀看到车夫并不打算避开那条狗，而是继续沿着狗卧着的那条车辙走，它就喊道：“车夫，别这样，不然我让你变成穷光蛋。”但是车夫自言自语地嘟哝道：“你才不能把我变成穷光蛋呢。”他甩了个响鞭，赶着马车从狗的身上碾了过去，把狗轧死了。麻雀哭喊道：“你轧死了我的狗兄弟，你会为此赔上你的马车和马。”“马车和马，哼！”车夫说。“看你能把我怎么样？”他继续驾着车向前走。于是麻雀偷偷飞进车篷内，一直不停地啄同一个桶塞，就那样把塞子啄了出来，然后这一桶酒都流光了，车夫却毫无察觉。等到车夫偶然向后看时，发现车湿淋淋的，再一看酒桶时，发现其中一个已经空了。“我多倒霉啊！”他哭喊道。“还不够倒霉呢。”麻雀说着，又飞到其中一匹马的头上，把马的眼睛啄了出来。车夫一看，便取出斧子想砍那麻雀，但是麻雀飞到了空中，斧头正砍在他的马的头上，那匹马倒下去死掉了。“啊，我是个多么倒霉的人啊！”他哭喊道。“还不够倒霉呢。”麻雀说道。当车夫驾着两匹马拉的车继续前行时，麻雀又一次偷偷飞进了车篷，将第二个酒桶的塞子啄了出来，于是所有酒就都泼洒光了。当车夫意识到时，他又哭喊道：“啊，我是个多么倒霉的人啊！”但麻雀回应道：“还不够倒霉呢。”接着又飞落在第二匹马的头上，把马的眼睛啄了出来。车夫跑上前去举起斧头向它砍去，但是麻雀飞到了空中，而斧子又砍着了第二匹马，马倒地死了。“啊，我是个多么倒霉的人啊！”“还不够倒霉呢。”麻雀说，接着停落在第三匹马的头上，又把马的眼睛啄了出来。车夫火冒三丈，看都不看，就拿斧头向麻雀砍去，却还是没有砍到麻雀，反倒又这样砍死了他的第三匹马。“啊，我是个多么倒霉的人啊！”他哭喊道。“还不够倒霉呢。”麻雀说。“我会让你家里也碰上倒霉事。”说完就飞走了。","A sheep-dog had not a good master, but, on the contrary, one who let him suffer hunger.As he could stay no longer with him, he went quite sadly away.On the road he met a sparrow who said, “Brother dog, why art thou so sad?”The dog replied, “I am hungry, and have nothing to eat.”Then said the sparrow, “Dear brother, come into the town with me, and I will satisfy thy hunger.”So they went into the town together, and when they came in front of a butcher’s shop the sparrow said to the dog, “Stay there, and I will pick a bit of meat down for thee,” and he alighted on the stall, looked about him to see that no one was observing him, and pecked and pulled and tore so long at a piece which lay on the edge, that it slipped down.Then the dog seized it, ran into a corner, and devoured it.The sparrow said, “Now come with me to another shop, and then I will get thee one more piece that thou mayst be satisfied.”When the dog had devoured the second piece as well, the sparrow asked, “Brother dog, hast thou now had enough?”“Yes, I have had meat enough,” he answered, “but I have had no bread yet.”Said the sparrow, “Thou shalt have that also, come with me.”Then he took him to a baker’s shop, and pecked at a couple of little buns till they rolled down, and as the dog wanted still more, he led him to another stall, and again got bread for him.When that was consumed, the sparrow said, “Brother dog, hast thou now had enough?”“Yes,” he replied, “now we will walk a while outside the town.”Then they both went out on to the highway.It was, however, warm weather, and when they had walked a little way the dog said, “I am tired, and would like to sleep.”“Well, do sleep,” answered the sparrow, “and in the meantime I will seat myself on a branch.”So the dog lay down on the road, and fell fast asleep.Whilst he lay sleeping there, a waggoner came driving by, who had a cart with three horses, laden with two barrels of wine.The sparrow, however, saw that he was not going to turn aside, but was staying in the wheel track in which the dog was lying, so it cried, “Waggoner, don’t do it, or I will make thee poor.”The waggoner, however, growled to himself, “Thou wilt not make me poor,” and cracked his whip and drove the cart over the dog, and the wheels killed him.Then the sparrow cried, “Thou hast run over my brother dog and killed him, it shall cost thee thy cart and horses.”“Cart and horses indeed!” said the waggoner.“What harm canst thou do me?” and drove onwards.Then the sparrow crept under the cover of the cart, and pecked so long at the same bung-hole that he got the bung out, and then all the wine ran out without the driver noticing it.But once when he was looking behind him he saw that the cart was dripping, and looked at the barrels and saw that one of them was empty.“Unfortunate fellow that I am,” cried he.“Not unfortunate enough yet,” said the sparrow, and flew on to the head of one of the horses and pecked his eyes out.When the driver saw that, he drew out his axe and wanted to hit the sparrow, but the sparrow flew into the air, and he hit his horse on the head, and it fell down dead.“Oh, what an unfortunate man I am,” cried he.“Not unfortunate enough yet,” said the sparrow, and when the driver drove on with the two hoses, the sparrow again crept under the cover, and pecked the bung out of the second cask, so all the wine was spilt.When the driver became aware of it, he again cried, “Oh, what an unfortunate man I am,” but the sparrow replied, “Not unfortunate enough yet,” and seated himself on the head of the second horse, and pecked his eyes out.The driver ran up to it and raised his axe to strike, but the sparrow flew into the air and the blow struck the horse, which fell.“Oh, what an unfortunate man I am.”“Not unfortunate enough yet,” said the sparrow, and lighted on the third horse’s head, and pecked out his eyes.The driver, in his rage, struck at the sparrow without looking round, and did not hit him but killed his third horse likewise.“Oh, what an unfortunate man I am,” cried he.“Not unfortunate enough yet,” answered the sparrow.“Now will I make thee unfortunate in thy home,” and flew away."
"车夫只好把马车留在原地，怒气冲冲地回家了。“唉，”他对妻子说，“我遇到了好多倒霉事啊！我的酒都流光了，三匹马也都死了！”“哎呀，亲爱的，”她回答说，“有只恶毒的鸟飞进了屋子！它召集了世界上所有的鸟，落在楼上晾着的谷物上，正大吃特吃呢。”车夫走上楼，只见成千上万只鸟正停在阁楼上，并吃完了他家所有的谷物，而那只麻雀正坐在那群鸟中间。于是那车夫又哭喊道：“啊，我是个多么倒霉的人啊！”","The driver had to leave the waggon standing, and full of anger and vexation went home.“Ah,” said he to his wife, “what misfortunes I have had!My wine has run out, and the horses are all three dead!”“Alas, husband,” she answered, “what a malicious bird has come into the house!It has gathered together every bird there is in the world, and they have fallen on our corn up there, and are devouring it.”Then he went upstairs, and thousands and thousands of birds were sitting in the loft and had eaten up all the corn, and the sparrow was sitting in the midst of them.Then the driver cried, “Oh, what an unfortunate man I am?”"
"“还不够倒霉呢！”麻雀回答说，“车夫，你会为此付出生命的代价。”接着便飞了出去。","“Not unfortunate enough yet!” answered the sparrow; “waggoner, it shall cost thee thy life as well,” and flew out."
"车夫失去了所有的财产。他走到楼下的房间，在火炉后面坐了下来，感到万分愤怒和痛苦。可麻雀仍坐在窗子外面喊着：“车夫，你会为此付出生命的代价！”于是车夫抓过斧子就扔向麻雀，但斧子只是砸碎了窗户，却没有砸到麻雀。麻雀飞了进来，落在了火炉上喊道：“车夫，你会为此付出生命的代价。”车夫非常生气，失去了理智，他重击火炉，把它砸成了两半。麻雀飞来飞去，飞过他家里每一件家具，它飞到哪儿车夫就砸到哪儿：穿衣镜、长凳、餐桌，最后是他家房子的墙，他却还是没能砸到麻雀。然而最后，他终于用手抓住了麻雀。他的妻子问道：“要我杀了它吗？”“不，”他喊道，“那样对它太仁慈了。它应该死得更加惨烈。”接着，他抓住麻雀，把它活吞了下去。可麻雀开始在他的身体里乱跳，并且又跳进了他的嘴里，伸出头来喊道：“车夫，你会为此付出生命的代价！”车夫把斧子给了他的妻子，说道：“老婆，帮我把我嘴里的这只鸟杀了。”那个妇人便砍了过去，但是没有砍准，却直直地砸在了车夫的脑袋上，车夫便倒地而死。那只麻雀却飞走了。","Then the waggoner had lost all his property, and he went downstairs into the room, sat down behind the stove and was quite furious and bitter.But the sparrow sat outside in front of the window, and cried, “Waggoner, it shall cost thee thy life.”Then the waggoner snatched the axe and threw it at the sparrow, but it only broke the window, and did not hit the bird.The sparrow now hopped in, placed itself on the stove and cried, “Waggoner, it shall cost thee thy life.”The latter, quite mad and blind with rage, smote the stove in twain, and as the sparrow flew from one place to another so it fared with all his household furniture, looking-glass, benches, table, and at last the walls of his house, and yet he could not hit the bird.At length, however, he caught it with his hand.Then his wife said, “Shall I kill it?”“No,” cried he, “that would be too merciful.It shall die much more cruelly,” and he took it and swallowed it whole.The sparrow, however, began to flutter about in his body, and fluttered up again into the man’s mouth; then it stretched out its head, and cried, “Waggoner, it shall still cost thee thy life.”The driver gave the axe to his wife, and said, “Wife, kill the bird in my mouth for me.”The woman struck, but missed her blow, and hit the waggoner right on his head, so that he fell dead.But the sparrow flew up and away."
"狐狸和他的表亲","The Fox and His Cousin"
"母狼生下了一只小狼，于是请狐狸当教父。她说：“毕竟狐狸是我们的近亲，他不但理解力强，而且又有才能，他肯定能教好我的小儿子，帮他在世界上生存。”狐狸装得很真诚的样子，说道：“敬爱的教母，您这么看得起我，实在是我的荣幸；但我一定会做得让你满意。”在酒席上，他高兴地尽情大吃，然后他说：“亲爱的狼妈妈，我们有责任照顾好孩子。他必须吃好吃的食物才能强壮。我知道有一个羊圈，我们可以去抓一只美味的羊回来。”母狼听了这话很欣喜，于是跟狐狸一同去了那个农场。狐狸远远地指着羊圈说：“你从那儿钻进去，不会被发现。同时我会在另一边看看能不能捉到一只鸡。”然而狐狸并没有走那边，而是在森林的入口坐了下来，他伸了伸腿休息起来。母狼钻进了羊圈。一只狗正躺在那儿，它看见母狼后就叫起来，于是农夫跑出来逮住了母狼，还泼了她一身准备用来洗涤的水，滚烫烫的。最后她总算是逃了出来，蹒跚地走出农场。狐狸还躺在那儿，假装充满怨气地说：“噢，亲爱的女士，我可倒了大霉了，农夫们偶然间发现了我，把我的四条腿都打断了。要是你不想让我躺在这里死去，就把我背走吧。”尽管母狼自己只能慢慢地走，但是她很关心狐狸，还是把他背在了背上，缓慢地把他安然无恙地背回了她家里。然后狐狸对母狼大喊：“永别了，亲爱的狼妈妈，但愿这次的事能让你受益匪浅啊。”他痛快地嘲笑了母狼一番，便溜走了。","The she-wolf brought forth a young one, and invited the fox to be godfather.“After all, he is a near relative of ours,” said she, “he has a good understanding, and much talent; he can instruct my little son, and help him forward in the world.”The fox, too, appeared quite honest, and said, “Worthy Mrs. Gossip, I thank you for the honour which you are doing me; I will, however, conduct myself in such a way that you shall be repaid for it.”He enjoyed himself at the feast, and made merry; afterwards he said, “Dear Mrs. Gossip, it is our duty to take care of the child, it must have good food that it may be strong.I know a sheep-fold from which we might fetch a nice morsel.”The wolf was pleased with the ditty, and she went out with the fox to the farm-yard.He pointed out the fold from afar, and said, “You will be able to creep in there without being seen, and in the meantime I will look about on the other side to see if I can pick up a chicken.”He, however, did not go there, but sat down at the entrance to the forest, stretched his legs and rested.The she-wolf crept into the stable.A dog was lying there, and it made such a noise that the peasants came running out, caught Gossip Wolf, and poured a strong burning mixture, which had been prepared for washing, over her skin.At last she escaped, and dragged herself outside.There lay the fox, who pretended to be full of complaints, and said, “Ah, dear Mistress Gossip, how ill I have fared, the peasants have fallen on me, and have broken every limb I have; if you do not want me to lie where I am and perish, you must carry me away.”The she-wolf herself was only able to go away slowly, but she was in such concern about the fox that she took him on her back, and slowly carried him perfectly safe and sound to her house.Then the fox cried to her, “Farewell, dear Mistress Gossip, may the roasting you have had do you good,” laughed heartily at her, and bounded off."
"金鹅","The Golden Goose"
"从前有一个男人，膝下有三个儿子。最小的那个儿子被叫做“傻瓜”。“傻瓜”总是被人看不起，被人嘲弄，干什么事都被人欺负。","There was a man who had three sons, the youngest of whom was called Dummling, and was despised, mocked, and put down on every occasion."
"有一天，大儿子要到森林里去砍柴，出发前妈妈给了他一块精致的、美味的蛋糕和一瓶葡萄酒，怕他饿着或是渴着。","It happened that the eldest wanted to go into the forest to hew wood, and before he went his mother gave him a beautiful sweet cake and a bottle of wine in order that he might not suffer from hunger or thirst."
"在森林里，大儿子遇到了一位头发灰白的小老头。小老头向他问了一声好，然后对他说：“把你口袋里的蛋糕给我一块，让我喝口你的葡萄酒吧，我实在是又渴又饿。”但精明的大儿子回答道：“如果我把蛋糕和葡萄酒给你了，我吃什么，你快给我滚开！”说完，他就把小老头儿晾在那里，自顾自地走了。","When he entered the forest there met him a little grey-haired old man who bade him good-day, and said, “Do give me a piece of cake out of your pocket, and let me have a draught of your wine; I am so hungry and thirsty.”But the prudent youth answered, “If I give you my cake and wine, I shall have none for myself; be off with you,” and he left the little man standing and went on."
"随后他就开始砍树，不一会儿，就不小心没砍准，一斧子砍到了自己的胳膊。于是他只好回家包扎伤口。这都是那个头发灰白的小老头捣的鬼啊。","But when he began to hew down a tree, it was not long before he made a false stroke, and the axe cut him in the arm, so that he had to go home and have it bound up.And this was the little grey man’s doing."
"之后，老二也要去森林里，妈妈像对待大儿子一样，给了他一块蛋糕和一瓶葡萄酒。他也同样碰上了那个头发灰白的小老头。小老头也恳求他给一块蛋糕和一口葡萄酒。但是，二儿子也十分理直气壮地说：“要是我把我的给了你，我吃什么，快滚！”他把小矮人晾在那里，扬长而去。然而，他很快也遭到了报应。刚砍了几下树，二儿子就砍伤了自己的腿，只得被人抬回家去。","After this the second son went into the forest, and his mother gave him, like the eldest, a cake and a bottle of wine.The little old grey man met him likewise, and asked him for a piece of cake and a drink of wine.But the second son, too, said with much reason, “What I give you will be taken away from myself; be off!” and he left the little man standing and went on.His punishment, however, was not delayed; when he had made a few strokes at the tree he struck himself in the leg, so that he had to be carried home."
"于是“傻瓜”对爸爸说：“爸爸，让我去砍柴吧。”爸爸回答道：“你两个哥哥去砍柴都把自己砍伤了，你一点都不会，就别去了。”但是“傻瓜”一个劲地恳求，最后爸爸说：“那你去吧，也许伤着自己以后，你能变聪明点。”妈妈给了他一块掺了很多水、在灶灰里烤出的饼子和一瓶酸啤酒。","Then Dummling said, “Father, do let me go and cut wood.”The father answered, “Your brothers have hurt themselves with it, leave it alone, you do not understand anything about it.”But Dummling begged so long that at last he said, “Just go then, you will get wiser by hurting yourself.”His mother gave him a cake made with water and baked in the cinders, and with it a bottle of sour beer."
"在森林里，他也同样碰上了那个头发灰白的小老头。小老头跟他打招呼，说：“我又渴又饿，给我一块你的饼子，让我喝口你的酒。”“傻瓜”回答说：“我只有灶灰里烤的饼子和酸啤酒，如果你不嫌弃的话，我们一起坐下来吃吧。”所以他们就坐了下来。可是当“傻瓜”拿出他的灶灰里烤的饼子时，饼子变成了一块精美可口的蛋糕，而酸啤酒也变成了上好的葡萄酒。他们吃完喝完之后，小老头对他说：“你有一颗善良的心，乐于分享，因此我要带给你好运。那边有一棵古老的树，去把它砍倒，在树根里你会找到宝物的。”说完这些，小老头就离开了。","When he came to the forest the little old grey man met him likewise, and greeting him, said, “Give me a piece of your cake and a drink out of your bottle; I am so hungry and thirsty.”Dummling answered, “I have only cinder-cake and sour beer; if that pleases you, we will sit down and eat.”So they sat down, and when Dummling pulled out his cinder-cake, it was a fine sweet cake, and the sour beer had become good wine.So they ate and drank, and after that the little man said, “Since you have a good heart, and are willing to divide what you have, I will give you good luck.There stands an old tree, cut it down, and you will find something at the roots.”Then the little man took leave of him."
"“傻瓜”走过去砍倒了那棵树。他发现树根里坐着一只金鹅，全身的羽毛都是纯金的。他抱起金鹅，带着它去了一家旅店，准备在那里过夜。旅店的店主有三个女儿，她们看到金鹅都很好奇，想知道这么漂亮的是什么鸟，也都想得到一根金羽毛。","Dummling went and cut down the tree, and when it fell there was a goose sitting in the roots with feathers of pure gold.He lifted her up, and taking her with him, went to an inn where he thought he would stay the night.Now the host had three daughters, who saw the goose and were curious to know what such a wonderful bird might be, and would have liked to have one of its golden feathers."
"大女儿心想：“我应该赶快找到个机会拔根它的毛。”于是一等“傻瓜”出门，她就抓住金鹅的翅膀，谁料她的手指被牢牢粘在金鹅身上了。","The eldest thought, “I shall soon find an opportunity of pulling out a feather,” and as soon as Dummling had gone out she seized the goose by the wing, but her finger and hand remained sticking fast to it."
"紧接着，二女儿也进来了，她只想着为自己拔一根羽毛，但是她一碰到姐姐，就被牢牢地粘住了。","The second came soon afterwards, thinking only of how she might get a feather for herself, but she had scarcely touched her sister than she was held fast."
"最后三女儿也抱着同样的目的进来了。两个姐姐冲她喊道：“千万别过来！看在老天爷的份上，别过来！”但她不明白两个姐姐为什么不让她过去。三女儿想：“她们两个都在那儿，我也应该在那儿。”于是，她向两个姐姐跑过去。但她一碰到姐姐，就被牢牢地粘住了。所以三姐妹只得陪着金鹅过了一晚。","At last the third also came with the like intent, and the others screamed out, “Keep away; for goodness’ sake keep away!”But she did not understand why she was to keep away.“The others are there,” she thought, “I may as well be there too,” and ran to them; but as soon as she had touched her sister, she remained sticking fast to her.So they had to spend the night with the goose."
"第二天早上，“傻瓜”抱起金鹅夹在腋下就上路了，没有理睬粘在金鹅上的三个姑娘。三个姑娘只得一直跟在“傻瓜”身后，忽左忽右，“傻瓜”去哪儿，她们就跟着去哪儿。","The next morning Dummling took the goose under his arm and set out, without troubling himself about the three girls who were hanging on to it.They were obliged to run after him continually, now left, now right, just as he was inclined to go."
"走到地里时，他们遇上了一位牧师。牧师看到这队人，说道：“你们这帮没用的丫头，也不知道害臊，跟着一个小伙子到处跑！这像话吗！”说着，牧师一把拉住最小的姑娘，想把她拉开，但他一碰上她就同样被牢牢粘住了，不得不跟在后面跑起来。","In the middle of the fields the parson met them, and when he saw the procession he said, “For shame, you good-for-nothing girls, why are you running across the fields after this young man? is that seemly?”At the same time he seized the youngest by the hand in order to pull her away, but as soon as he touched her he likewise stuck fast, and was himself obliged to run behind."
"不一会儿，教堂司事过来了。他看到牧师跟在三个姑娘后面跑。他感到十分吃惊，大喊道：“嗨，牧师先生，阁下这么急匆匆是要上哪儿去啊？不要忘了今天我们还要给人施洗呢！”说着，他跑上前去，拉住牧师的衣袖，于是也被粘住了。","Before long the sexton came by and saw his master, the parson, running behind three girls.He was astonished at this and called out, “Hi, your reverence, whither away so quickly? do not forget that we have a christening to-day!” and running after him he took him by the sleeve, but was also held fast to it."
"正当这五个人这样一个跟着一个一路小跑的时候，地里走过来两个扛着锄头的农夫。牧师喊叫着请他们把他自己和教堂司事从这队人里分开。可他们一碰到教堂司事就被粘住了。这样一来，就有七个人跟在“傻瓜”和金鹅后面跑了。","Whilst the five were trotting thus one behind the other, two labourers came with their hoes from the fields; the parson called out to them and begged that they would set him and the sexton free.But they had scarcely touched the sexton when they were held fast, and now there were seven of them running behind Dummling and the goose."
"不久，“傻瓜”来到一座城市。住在城里的国王有一个女儿，她冷若冰霜，谁也没办法使她笑一笑。于是国王颁布了一项法令，谁能把公主逗笑，谁就能娶她。“傻瓜”听说了这件事，就带着金鹅和身后的一大队人去见公主。公主一见到这七个人一个跟着一个不停地跑，就开始哈哈大笑，好像一笑就停不下来了。于是“傻瓜”提出要娶公主为妻。他们举行了一场盛大的婚礼。国王死后，“傻瓜”继承了王位，和他妻子一起幸福地生活了很久。","Soon afterwards he came to a city, where a king ruled who had a daughter who was so serious that no one could make her laugh.So he had put forth a decree that whosoever should be able to make her laugh should marry her.When Dummling heard this, he went with his goose and all her train before the King’s daughter, and as soon as she saw the seven people running on and on, one behind the other, she began to laugh quite loudly, and as if she would never leave off.Thereupon Dummling asked to have her for his wife, and the wedding was celebrated.After the King’s death, Dummling inherited the kingdom and lived a long time contentedly with his wife."
"金钥匙","The Golden Key"
"隆冬，大雪覆盖大地，一个贫穷的小孩还得滑着雪橇到外面拾柴火。把捡来的柴火堆到一块捆起来后，他不想马上回家，而想生一把火给自己暖和暖和，因为他都快冻僵了。于是他扒开一块雪地，正当他清理积雪的时候，他发现了一把小小的金钥匙。因此他想有钥匙在的地方，锁也应该在这儿，于是他就在地上挖起来，终于挖到了一个铁盒。“要是这把钥匙能配这个盒子就好了！”他想，“那盒子里一定有许多宝贝。”他找了找，就是没找到锁眼。最后，他终于找到了锁眼，但是锁眼小得都几乎看不到。他拿钥匙试了试，钥匙正好能伸进去。然后，他拧了钥匙一圈。现在我们得等他把盒子打开，揭开盖子，然后我们就会知道铁盒里究竟有什么好东西了。","In the winter time, when deep snow lay on the ground, a poor boy was forced to go out on a sledge to fetch wood.When he had gathered it together, and packed it, he wished, as he was so frozen with cold, not to go home at once, but to light a fire and warm himself a little.So he scraped away the snow, and as he was thus clearing the ground, he found a tiny, gold key.Hereupon he thought that where the key was, the lock must be also, and dug in the ground and found an iron chest.“If the key does but fit it!” thought he; “no doubt there are precious things in that little box.”He searched, but no keyhole was there.At last he discovered one, but so small that it was hardly visible.He tried it, and the key fitted it exactly.Then he turned it once round, and now we must wait until he has quite unlocked it and opened the lid, and then we shall learn what wonderful things were lying in that box."
"兔子和刺猬","The Hare and the Hedgehog"
"亲爱的小朋友们，这个故事听起来不像真的，但它确实是真的，因为我爷爷给我讲这个故事的时候总是自信满满地跟我说：“孩子，这肯定是真的，否则就没人会跟你说这个故事了。”故事是这样的。正值丰收时节，一个星期天的上午，荞麦欣欣向荣地生长着，明媚的太阳在天空闪耀着，和煦的东风吹拂着收割后的田地，百灵鸟在天空中鸣唱，蜜蜂在荞麦地里嗡嗡起舞，人们穿着节日的盛装走向教堂，所有的生物都很开心，刺猬也不例外。","This story, my dear young folks, seems to be false, but it really is true, for my grandfather, from whom I have it, used always, when relating it, to say complacently, “It must be true, my son, or else no one could tell it to you.”The story is as follows.One Sunday morning about harvest time, just as the buckwheat was in bloom, the sun was shining brightly in heaven, the east wind was blowing warmly over the stubble-fields, the larks were singing in the air, the bees buzzing among the buckwheat, the people were all going in their Sunday clothes to church, and all creatures were happy, and the hedgehog was happy too."
"刺猬站在自家门口，双手叉腰，正享受着清晨的微风，他慢悠悠地用颤音唱着小曲，跟其他刺猬在幸福的星期天早上习惯唱的小曲一样，不会更好也不会更差。正当他唱得兴起的时候，他突然想到这会儿老婆正在给孩子们洗澡擦身子，他不妨去田里散散步，同时看看他的萝卜长得怎么样了。萝卜其实就长在他家房子旁边，因为他们一家子都习惯了以此为食，所以也就将之视为己有。说去就去。刺猬关上身后的门，向田里走去。离家没走多远，正要绕过田边的黑刺李灌木丛进到萝卜地时，他看见兔子也出来做同样的事了，也就是说他也打算来看看他的白菜长得怎么样了。刺猬一看到兔子，就友好地说了声“早上好！”而兔子呢，自以为是位高贵的绅士，十分傲慢自大，没有回应刺猬的问候，只是轻蔑地问道：“这么一大早，你怎么这么巧就跑到田里来了？”“我出来散散步。”刺猬答道。“散步？”兔子笑着说道，“在我看来，你还是用你那双腿干点别的好！”这话让刺猬十分生气，因为他无法忍受别人取笑它天生就弯曲的腿。于是，刺猬对兔子说：“你显然以为你的腿比我的腿要能干些啰？”“正是如此！”兔子说道。“那我们就比试比试吧！”刺猬说道，“我打赌，如果我们比跑步我准赢你！”“真是可笑！就凭你那短腿！”兔子说道，“但如果你真敢斗胆一试，我倒是没意见。那我们赌什么？”“就赌一个金路易（法国古金币名）和一瓶白兰地。”刺猬说道。“一言为定！”兔子应道，“握手约定，然后我们不妨马上就开始！”“不！”刺猬说道，“别这么急嘛！我还空着肚子呢，我想先回家吃个早饭！半个小时后我会再回到这儿来。”","The hedgehog, however, was standing by his door with his arms akimbo, enjoying the morning breezes, and slowly trilling a little song to himself, which was neither better nor worse than the songs which hedgehogs are in the habit of singing on a blessed Sunday morning.Whilst he was thus singing half aloud to himself, it suddenly occurred to him that, while his wife was washing and drying the children, he might very well take a walk into the field, and see how his turnips were going on.The turnips were, in fact, close beside his house, and he and his family were accustomed to eat them, for which reason he looked upon them as his own.No sooner said than done.The hedgehog shut the house-door behind him, and took the path to the field.He had not gone very far from home, and was just turning round the sloe-bush which stands there outside the field, to go up into the turnip-field, when he observed the hare who had gone out on business of the same kind, namely, to visit his cabbages.When the hedgehog caught sight of the hare, he bade him a friendly good morning.But the hare, who was in his own way a distinguished gentleman, and frightfully haughty, did not return the hedgehog’s greeting, but said to him, assuming at the same time a very contemptuous manner, “How do you happen to be running about here in the field so early in the morning?”“I am taking a walk,” said the hedgehog.“A walk!” said the hare, with a smile.“It seems to me that you might use your legs for a better purpose.”This answer made the hedgehog furiously angry, for he can bear anything but an attack on his legs, just because they are crooked by nature.So now the hedgehog said to the hare, “You seem to imagine that you can do more with your legs than I with mine.”“That is just what I do think,” said the hare.“That can be put to the test,” said the hedgehog.“I wager that if we run a race, I will outstrip you.”“That is ridiculous!You with your short legs!” said the hare, “but for my part I am willing, if you have such a monstrous fancy for it.What shall we wager?”“A golden louis-d’or and a bottle of brandy,” said the hedgehog.“Done,” said the hare.“Shake hands on it, and then we may as well come off at once.”“Nay,” said the hedgehog, “there is no such great hurry!I am still fasting, I will go home first, and have a little breakfast.In half-an-hour I will be back again at this place.”"
"兔子十分满意于这一安排，于是刺猬离开了。回家的路上，刺猬心想：“兔子靠的是他的长腿，我得想个赢他的办法！他也许是个大人物，但他却是个蠢家伙，他会为他所说的话付出代价的！”于是，刺猬一到家，就对他老婆说：“老婆，快穿好衣服，跟我到田里去！”“发生什么事啦？”刺猬的老婆问道。“我跟兔子打赌，赌一个金路易和一瓶白兰地。我要跟他赛跑，你得在场。”“我的天呐！老公！”老婆叫了起来，“你疯了吗，你傻了吗？你怎么想到要跟兔子赛跑呢？”“少啰嗦，你这妇道人家！”刺猬说道，“这是我的事！男人的事，别多嘴！滚过去，穿好衣服，跟我走！”刺猬的老婆又能怎么办呢？无论她喜不喜欢，都得对丈夫言听计从。","Hereupon the hedgehog departed, for the hare was quite satisfied with this.On his way the hedgehog thought to himself, “The hare relies on his long legs, but I will contrive to get the better of him.He may be a great man, but he is a very silly fellow, and he shall pay for what he has said.”So when the hedgehog reached home, he said to his wife, “Wife, dress thyself quickly, thou must go out to the field with me.”“What is going on, then?” said his wife.“I have made a wager with the hare, for a gold louis-d’or and a bottle of brandy.I am to run a race with him, and thou must be present.”“Good heavens, husband,” the wife now cried, “art thou not right in thy mind, hast thou completely lost thy wits?What can make thee want to run a race with the hare?”“Hold thy tongue, woman,” said the hedgehog, “that is my affair.Don’t begin to discuss things which are matters for men.Be off, dress thyself, and come with me.”What could the hedgehog’s wife do?She was forced to obey him, whether she liked it or not."
"他俩一起走在路上时，刺猬对他老婆说：“记住我要说的话。你看，我会把这长长的田野当作赛道。肯定是兔子跑一条犁沟，我跑一条，而且我们会从上面开始跑。现在你要做的就是站在这儿，在犁沟下面，当兔子跑到犁沟末端的时候，你得在对面冲他大喊：“我已经到了！”","So when they had set out on their way together, the hedgehog said to his wife, “Now pay attention to what I am going to say.Look you, I will make the long field our race-course.The hare shall run in one furrow, and I in another, and we will begin to run from the top.Now all that thou hast to do is to place thyself here below in the furrow, and when the hare arrives at the end of the furrow, on the other side of thee, thou must cry out to him, ‘I am here already!’”"
"接着他们到了田里，刺猬把她老婆要站的位置指给她看了后，他就向田里走去。当刺猬走到田野高处的时候，兔子已经等在那儿了。“我们可以开始了吗？”兔子问道。“当然可以！”刺猬答道，“马上就跑吧。”说着，他们已经在犁沟里各就各位了。兔子数着：“一，二，三，跑！”然后他就像一道旋风似地向田野下端跑去。可是刺猬呢，只跑了三步就停了下来，伏在犁沟里，静静地躲在那里。所以当兔子全速跑到田野低处那端时，刺猬的妻子便冲他大喊：“我已经到了！”兔子惊呆了，感到非常不可思议。因为刺猬的妻子和他的丈夫长得太像了，兔子以为正是刺猬本人在冲自己叫喊呢。然而，兔子寻思着：“这可不妙。”所以他喊道：“得重跑，我们重跑！”兔子又一次跑得如同暴雨中的狂风，他看起来就像在飞。而刺猬的妻子仍然静静地呆在原地。所以当兔子到达田野高处那端时，刺猬自己冲着兔子喊：“我已经到了！”然而，兔子气得发狂，他大喊道：“再跑，我们必须再跑一次！”“好啊！”刺猬回答道，“对我来说，你想跑多少次都行。”就这样兔子又跑了七十三次，刺猬一直奉陪到底，而且兔子每次到达顶端或底端的时候，都会有刺猬或者他的老婆在那儿叫：“我已经到了！”","Then they reached the field, and the hedgehog showed his wife her place, and then walked up the field.When he reached the top, the hare was already there.“Shall we start?” said the hare.“Certainly,” said the hedgehog.“Then both at once.”So saying, each placed himself in his own furrow.The hare counted, “Once, twice, thrice, and away!” and went off like a whirlwind down the field.The hedgehog, however, only ran about three paces, and then he stooped down in the furrow, and stayed quietly where he was.When the hare therefore arrived in full career at the lower end of the field, the hedgehog’s wife met him with the cry, “I am here already!”The hare was shocked and wondered not a little, he thought no other than that it was the hedgehog himself who was calling to him, for the hedgehog’s wife looked just like her husband.The hare, however, thought to himself, “That has not been done fairly,” and cried, “It must be run again, let us have it again.”And once more he went off like the wind in a storm, so that he seemed to fly.But the hedgehog’s wife stayed quietly in her place.So when the hare reached the top of the field, the hedgehog himself cried out to him, “I am here already.”The hare, however, quite beside himself with anger, cried, “It must be run again, we must have it again.”“All right,” answered the hedgehog, “for my part we’ll run as often as you choose.”So the hare ran seventy-three times more, and the hedgehog always held out against him, and every time the hare reached either the top or the bottom, either the hedgehog or his wife said, “I am here already.”"
"然而，就在跑第七十四次的时候，兔子再也跑不到终点了。他倒在了田地中央，口中血如泉涌，当场毙命。刺猬则拿着赢来的金路易和白兰地，叫出犁沟那端的妻子，夫妻俩高高兴兴地回家了；而且如果他们没死的话，应该至今还住在那儿呢！","At the seventy-fourth time, however, the hare could no longer reach the end.In the middle of the field he fell to the ground, blood streamed out of his mouth, and he lay dead on the spot.But the hedgehog took the louis-d’or which he had won and the bottle of brandy, called his wife out of the furrow, and both went home together in great delight, and if they are not dead, they are living there still."
"这就是刺猬如何让兔子和他在布克斯特胡德荒地里赛跑直至最后累死的经过，而且自那以后，再也没有兔子敢跟布克斯特胡德的刺猬赛跑了。","This is how it happened that the hedgehog made the hare run races with him on the Buxtehuder heath till he died, and since that time no hare has ever had any fancy for running races with a Buxtehuder hedgehog."
"然而这个故事的寓意是：第一，不管是什么大人物，他都不能嘲笑不如他的人，哪怕对方只是只刺猬；第二，它告诫大家，当男人结婚时，他应该找一个门当户对的人，这样看起来才相配。所以，如果是只刺猬，他就得确保他的老婆也一定是一只刺猬。","The moral of this story, however, is, firstly, that no one, however great he may be, should permit himself to jest at any one beneath him, even if he be only a hedgehog.And, secondly, it teaches, that when a man marries, he should take a wife in his own position, who looks just as he himself looks.So whosoever is a hedgehog let him see to it that his wife is a hedgehog also, and so forth."
"榛树枝","The Hazel-Branch"
"一天下午，幼年基督自己在摇篮里躺下睡着了。他的妈妈来到他跟前，看着他，满心欢喜，说道：“宝贝，你自己躺下睡了？好好睡，趁你睡觉，我去树林里给你采一些草莓，因为我知道你醒后看到草莓会非常高兴的。”在树林里，她发现有个地方长满了草莓，这是她见过长得最好看的草莓；但是就在她弯腰摘草莓时，草丛里窜出一条毒蛇。她惊恐万分，把草莓丢在原地，拔腿就跑。毒蛇紧追不舍，但这位女士知道怎么做最好，这个读者很快就会明白了。她藏在榛树灌木丛后面，站在那儿直到毒蛇爬走。然后她把草莓捡起来，准备回家，她说：“榛树灌木丛这次保护了我，将来也可以保护他人。”于是，从很早之前绿色的榛树枝就已经成为人们防范毒蛇等所有爬行动物的保护神了。","One afternoon the Christ-child had laid himself in his cradle-bed and had fallen asleep.Then his mother came to him, looked at him full of gladness, and said, “Hast thou laid thyself down to sleep, my child?”Sleep sweetly, and in the meantime I will go into the wood, and fetch thee a handful of strawberries, for I know that thou wilt be pleased with them when thou awakest.”In the wood outside, she found a spot with the most beautiful strawberries; but as she was stooping down to gather one, an adder sprang up out of the grass.She was alarmed, left the strawberries where they were, and hastened away.The adder darted after her; but Our Lady, as you can readily understand, knew what it was best to do.She hid herself behind a hazel-bush, and stood there until the adder had crept away again.Then she gathered the strawberries, and as she set out on her way home she said, “As the hazel-bush has been my protection this time, it shall in future protect others also.”Therefore, from the most remote times, a green hazel-branch has been the safest protection against adders, snakes, and everything else which creeps on the earth."
"上帝的动物和魔鬼的动物","The Lord’s Animals and the Devil’s"
"上帝创造了各种动物，并挑选了狼做他的狗，但是他却忘了造出山羊了。于是，魔鬼也准备就绪，开始创造动物。他造出了尾巴非常长的山羊。山羊们去牧场时，那长长的尾巴常常会缠在树篱上，这时魔鬼就不得不过去费好大劲把山羊的尾巴解开来。终于，这事惹恼了魔鬼。他便去牧场把每一只山羊的尾巴给咬掉了，我们今天从那剩下的一小截尾巴或许可以看出来。然后，魔鬼就让山羊们独自去牧场，但上帝恰巧注意到了它们，看到它们是怎样一会啃啮结满果实的果树，一会又去破坏茂盛威严的藤蔓，或者去毁坏其他脆弱的植物。上帝感到很难过。因此怀着善良和怜悯，他召集了他的狼群，很快就把牧场里的山羊撕成了碎片。魔鬼发现了这一切，便来到上帝面前说：“你造的物毁了我造的物。”上帝回答道：“为什么你要造物来进行破坏呢？”魔鬼说：“我也是被逼无奈啊！就像我的思想永远是邪恶的，我所造的物就没有什么其他的本性。你必须对我受到的巨大损失进行赔偿。”“橡树的叶子一落下我就会补偿你，那时候你来，我会把钱给你准备好。”等到橡树的树叶落了，魔鬼来了，他要求得到他应得的钱。但是上帝却说：“在君士坦丁堡的一个教堂里，有一棵高大的橡树，所有的树叶都还在上面没落呢。”魔鬼暴怒，咒骂着离开去寻找那棵橡树，在外四处飘荡了六个月后才找到。当他返回时，所有的橡树都在那一瞬间又长出了绿叶。魔鬼不得不放弃他的赔偿金。盛怒之下，他便挖出了所有剩下山羊的眼睛，然后把自己的眼睛放了进去。","The Lord God had created all animals, and had chosen out the wolf to be his dog, but he had forgotten the goat.Then the Devil made ready and began to create also, and created goats with fine long tails.Now when they went to pasture, they generally remained caught in the hedges by their tails, then the Devil had to go there and disentangle them, with a great deal of trouble.This enraged him at last, and he went and bit off the tail of every goat, as may be seen to this day by the stump.Then he let them go to pasture alone, but it came to pass that the Lord God perceived how at one time they gnawed away at a fruitful tree, at another injured the noble vines, or destroyed other tender plants.This distressed him, so that in his goodness and mercy he summoned his wolves, who soon tore in pieces the goats that went there.When the devil observed this, he went before the Lord and said, “Thy creatures have destroyed mine.”The Lord answered, “Why didst thou create things to do harm?”The Devil said, “I was compelled to do it: inasmuch as my thoughts run on evil, what I create can have no other nature, and thou must pay me heavy damages.”“I will pay thee as soon as the oak leaves fall; come then, thy money will then be ready counted out.”When the oak-leaves had fallen, the Devil came and demanded what was due to him.But the Lord said, “In the church of Constantinople stands a tall oak-tree which still has all its leaves.”With raging and curses, the Devil departed, and went to seek the oak, wandered in the wilderness for six months before he found it, and when he returned, all the oaks had in the meantime covered themselves again with green leaves.Then he had to forfeit his indemnity, and in his rage he put out the eyes of all the remaining goats, and put his own in instead."
"这就是为什么山羊有着魔鬼般的眼睛，它们的尾巴也被咬掉了，而且魔鬼也常常化身成山羊模样的原因。","This is why all goats have devil’s eyes, and their tails bitten off, and why he likes to assume their shape."
"爷爷和孙子","The Old Man and His Grandson"
"从前有位老人，他的视力不好，听力也不好，膝盖老打颤，坐在桌边吃饭时他几乎没法拿住汤匙，浓汤会洒在桌布上，或者会溢出嘴角。他的儿子媳妇都感到恶心，所以老人最后不得不在火炉后面的角落里坐着吃饭，他们用一只陶土碗盛饭给他，饭量甚至都不够吃的。他常常看着饭桌，两眼噙满了泪水。又有一次，他的手发颤，没有拿住碗，碗掉到地上摔碎了。年轻的媳妇把他数落了一番，但是他什么也没说，只是叹着气。于是他们花了点钱给他买了一只木碗，以后他必须用木碗吃饭。","There was once a very old man, whose eyes had become dim, his ears dull of hearing, his knees trembled, and when he sat at table he could hardly hold the spoon, and spilt the broth upon the table-cloth or let it run out of his mouth.His son and his son’s wife were disgusted at this, so the old grandfather at last had to sit in the corner behind the stove, and they gave him his food in an earthenware bowl, and not even enough of it.And he used to look towards the table with his eyes full of tears.Once, too, his trembling hands could not hold the bowl, and it fell to the ground and broke.The young wife scolded him, but he said nothing and only sighed.Then they bought him a wooden bowl for a few half-pence, out of which he had to eat."
"有一次他们就这样坐着，突然四岁的小孙子开始在地上收集一些木屑。“你在那儿干什么？”他父亲问道。“我正在做一个食槽。”孩子说道，“我长大后爸爸妈妈就可以用它来吃东西了。”","They were once sitting thus when the little grandson of four years old began to gather together some bits of wood upon the ground.“What are you doing there?” asked the father.“I am making a little trough,” answered the child, “for father and mother to eat out of when I am big.”"
"丈夫和妻子互相对望了一阵，不久就开始哭起来。接着他们就把年老的爷爷请到饭桌边，从那以后他们总是让他跟他们一起吃饭，爷爷吃饭时要是再把什么溢出来他们也不再说什么了。","The man and his wife looked at each other for a while, and presently began to cry.Then they took the old grandfather to the table, and henceforth always let him eat with them, and likewise said nothing if he did spill a little of anything."
"农夫与魔鬼","The Peasant and the Devil"
"很久以前，有一个狡黠而又颇有远见的农夫，他的妙计常为人们所谈起。而其中最精彩的，是他曾如何抓住并愚弄了魔鬼。一天，农夫在地里干活。暮色降临，他正准备回家，突然看到地中间有一堆燃着的煤。惊奇之余，他走上前去，看到一个小小的黑色魔鬼正坐在那堆烧得正旺的煤上。“你一定是坐在一堆财宝上了！”农夫说。“那当然了，”魔鬼答道，“这财宝里的金银比你一辈子见过得都要多！”“这堆财宝在我的地里，应该属于我。”农夫说。“它是你的，”魔鬼答道，“但前提是，你要把接下来这两年内地里长的所有东西都分我一半。钱我多得是，但我渴望得到大地的果实。”农夫答应了这笔交易。“不过，为了在分的时候不发生争议，”他说，“所有长在地面上的都归你，长在地面下的都归我。”魔鬼对这个交易非常满意，但是狡黠的农夫却种下了萝卜。","There was once on a time a far-sighted, crafty peasant whose tricks were much talked about.The best story is, however, how he once got hold of the Devil, and made a fool of him.The peasant had one day been working in his field, and as twilight had set in, was making ready for the journey home, when he saw a heap of burning coals in the middle of his field, and when, full of astonishment, he went up to it, a little black devil was sitting on the live coals.“Thou dost indeed sit upon a treasure!” said the peasant.“Yes, in truth,” replied the Devil, “on a treasure which contains more gold and silver than thou hast ever seen in thy life!”“The treasure lies in my field and belongs to me,” said the peasant.“It is thine,” answered the Devil, “if thou wilt for two years give me the half of everything thy field produces.Money I have enough of, but I have a desire for the fruits of the earth.”The peasant agreed to the bargain.“In order, however, that no dispute may arise about the division,” said he, “everything that is above ground shall belong to thee, and what is under the earth to me.”The Devil was quite satisfied with that, but the cunning peasant had sown turnips."
"到了收获的时节，魔鬼出现了，想要取走自己的收成。但除了枯黄的叶子，他什么也没有得到；农夫却满心欢喜地挖着他的萝卜。“这次算你分到的收成好，”魔鬼说，“但下次就不会了。这次，长在地面上的归你，长在地面下的归我。”“我愿意。”农夫答道。而当播种的时节再次来临，他种的却不是萝卜，而是小麦。谷粒成熟时，农夫去地里把小麦齐根割下放在了地上。魔鬼来后，除了收割后剩下的残茎，什么都没有找到。他愤怒地钻进石头缝里离开了。“这就是愚弄魔鬼的办法。”农夫说着，带着财宝离开了。","Now when the time for harvest came, the Devil appeared and wanted to take away his crop; but he found nothing but the yellow withered leaves, while the peasant, full of delight, was digging up his turnips.“Thou hast had the best of it for once,” said the Devil, “but the next time that won’t do.What grows above ground shall be thine, and what is under it, mine.”“I am willing,” replied the peasant; but when the time came to sow, he did not again sow turnips, but wheat.The grain became ripe, and the peasant went into the field and cut the full stalks down to the ground.When the Devil came, he found nothing but the stubble, and went away in a fury down into a cleft in the rocks.“That is the way to cheat the Devil,” said the peasant, and went and fetched away the treasure."
"聪明的农家女","The Peasant’s Wise Daughter"
"从前，有个贫穷的农夫，他没有土地，只有一间小房子和一个女儿。有一天，他女儿说道：“我们应该向国王陛下要一小块新开垦的土地。”国王得知他们生活贫困后，便赐给他们一块土地。父女俩打算翻翻地，种一些谷物之类的东西。快要翻完这块地时，他们发现了一个纯金做的臼。“听着,”农夫对女儿说，“既然国王对我们这么仁慈，还给我们土地，我们就应该把这臼献给他，作为对他的回报。”然而，女儿却不同意这么做，她说：“爸爸，即使我们有了臼也没有杵啊，我们得找到杵，所以，现在你最好什么也别说。”但农夫没有听女儿的，而是把那金臼送到了国王那里，告诉国王他从那块新开垦的土地里挖出了这个金臼，并问他愿不愿意接受这个礼物。国王拿了臼，又问他除了臼有没有发现别的什么东西。“没有。”农夫回答道。然后国王命令他必须马上把杵找来。农夫说他们没有发现杵，但他说什么也不管用了。他被关进了监狱，而且会一直被关在那里，除非他能交出那个杵来。仆人们每天都给他送面包和水，这就是牢饭了。他们总能听到农夫不停地哭喊着：“啊！我要是听了女儿的话该多好啊！哎呀，天哪，我要是听了女儿的话该多好啊！”他不吃面包，也不喝水。于是国王命令仆人们把这个囚犯带到他面前，问他为何总是哭喊，“啊！我要是听了女儿的话该多好啊”，以及他女儿到底说了什么。“她对我说，我不能把臼献给您，因为我还得交出杵。”“如果你的女儿真有这么聪明，叫她来见我。”于是，她被带到国王面前。国王问她是不是真有那么聪明，还说他会给她出个谜语，如果她能猜对，他就娶她为妻。她立即答应了，她会猜出来的。于是，国王说道：“如果你能不穿衣也不赤身裸体，不骑马也不步行，不在路中也不在路外地来到我跟前，我就娶你。”于是她离开了。她先脱掉了所有的衣服，便不算穿衣；然后拿来一张大大的渔网，把自己紧紧地一圈圈裹在里面，就不算赤身裸体了。她又租了头驴子，把渔网绑在驴尾巴上，迫使驴子拉着她走，这样她便既没有骑马也没有步行了。驴子只能拽着她顺着车辙走，她只用大脚趾接触地面，这样就既不在路中也不在路外。当她以这般模样抵达王宫时，国王说她已经破解了那个谜，并且符合了所有的条件。于是他下令释放了她父亲，娶她为妻，并将所有的皇室财产都交给她掌管。","There was once a poor peasant who had no land, but only a small house, and one daughter.Then said the daughter, “We ought to ask our lord the King for a bit of newly-cleared land.”When the King heard of their poverty, he presented them with a piece of land, which she and her father dug up, and intended to sow with a little corn and grain of that kind.When they had dug nearly the whole of the field, they found in the earth a mortar made of pure gold.“Listen,” said the father to the girl, “as our lord the King has been so gracious and presented us with the field, we ought to give him this mortar in return for it.”The daughter, however, would not consent to this, and said, “Father, if we have the mortar without having the pestle as well, we shall have to get the pestle, so you had much better say nothing about it.”He would, however, not obey her, but took the mortar and carried it to the King, said that he had found it in the cleared land, and asked if he would accept it as a present.The King took the mortar, and asked if he had found nothing besides that?“No,” answered the countryman.Then the King said that he must now bring him the pestle.The peasant said they had not found that, but he might just as well have spoken to the wind; he was put in prison, and was to stay there until he produced the pestle.The servants had daily to carry him bread and water, which is what people get in prison, and they heard how the man cried out continually, “Ah!if I had but listened to my daughter!Alas, alas, if I had but listened to my daughter!” and would neither eat nor drink.So he commanded the servants to bring the prisoner before him, and then the King asked the peasant why he was always crying, “Ah!if I had but listened to my daughter!” and what it was that his daughter had said.“She told me that I ought not to take the mortar to you, for I should have to produce the pestle as well.”“If you have a daughter who is as wise as that, let her come here.”She was therefore obliged to appear before the King, who asked her if she really was so wise, and said he would set her a riddle, and if she could guess that, he would marry her.She at once said yes, she would guess it.Then said the King, “Come to me not clothed, not naked, not riding, not walking, not in the road, and not out of the road, and if thou canst do that I will marry thee.”So she went away, put off everything she had on, and then she was not clothed, and took a great fishing net, and seated herself in it and wrapped it entirely round and round her, so that she was not naked, and she hired an ass, and tied the fisherman’s net to its tail, so that it was forced to drag her along, and that was neither riding nor walking.The ass had also to drag her in the ruts, so that she only touched the ground with her great toe, and that was neither being in the road nor out of the road.And when she arrived in that fashion, the King said she had guessed the riddle and fulfilled all the conditions.Then he ordered her father to be released from the prison, took her to wife, and gave into her care all the royal possessions."
"几年后，有一次国王整队阅兵时，正巧有一些卖木材的农夫把车停在了王宫外，有些是牛车，有些是马车。其中一个农夫有三匹马，其中一匹马生了个小马驹，马驹跑去卧在另一辆马车前的两头公牛中间了。当两个农夫们碰到一起的时候，便开始争论、互相殴打，引起一阵骚乱。牛车的主人想要这个马驹，说马驹是他的牛所生，而马车的主人又说马驹是他的马所生，马驹是他的。后来，他们吵到了国王那儿。国王给出了裁决：小马驹应该呆在原地。所以，牛车的主人得到了本不属于自己的马驹。另一个农夫哭着离开了，为自己的马驹感到难过。这时候他听说王后很有同情心，因为她出身于贫困的农家，他便去拜见王后并乞求她，看她能否帮忙重新要回自己的马驹。王后说：“好的，如果你保证不出卖我，我就告诉你该怎么做。明天一大早当国王检阅卫兵时，你拿一大张渔网，就把它放在国王必经的地方，假装你在捕鱼。他来了你也继续，并假装着倒渔网，好像你已经捕满了鱼。”然后她又告诉他如果国王问起，应该怎样回答。于是，第二天，那个农夫便站在旱地上捕鱼。当国王经过看到那个场景后，便派他的信使去问问那个愚蠢的农夫在忙些什么。农夫答道：“我在捕鱼。”信使又问他，那儿没有水他怎么能捕到鱼呢。农夫回答说：“对于我来说，在干涸的地上捕到鱼就跟一头公牛生个马驹一样简单。”信使回去把农夫的回答禀报给了国王。国王便下令把那农夫带来，告诉农夫他知道这并不是农夫自己的主意，并想知道是谁替他出的主意。农夫必须马上坦白。然而，那个农夫没有坦白，而是一直说，上帝不允许他这么做！那办法是他自己想到的。于是他们把他放倒在一堆稻草上，一直不停地痛打并折磨他。最后，农夫供认了是王后出的主意。","Now when some years had passed, the King was once drawing up his troops on parade, when it happened that some peasants who had been selling wood stopped with their waggons before the palace; some of them had oxen yoked to them, and some horses.There was one peasant who had three horses, one of which was delivered of a young foal, and it ran away and lay down between two oxen which were in front of the waggon.When the peasants came together, they began to dispute, to beat each other and make a disturbance, and the peasant with the oxen wanted to keep the foal, and said one of the oxen had given birth to it, and the other said his horse had had it, and that it was his.The quarrel came before the King, and he give the verdict that the foal should stay where it had been found, and so the peasant with the oxen, to whom it did not belong, got it.Then the other went away, and wept and lamented over his foal.Now he had heard how gracious his lady the Queen was because she herself had sprung from poor peasant folks, so he went to her and begged her to see if she could not help him to get his foal back again.Said she, “Yes, I will tell you what to do, if thou wilt promise me not to betray me.Early to-morrow morning, when the King parades the guard, place thyself there in the middle of the road by which he must pass, take a great fishing-net and pretend to be fishing; go on fishing, too, and empty out the net as if thou hadst got it full” and then she told him also what he was to say if he was questioned by the King.The next day, therefore, the peasant stood there, and fished on dry ground.When the King passed by, and saw that, he sent his messenger to ask what the stupid man was about?He answered, “I am fishing.”The messenger asked how he could fish when there was no water there?The peasant said, “It is as easy for me to fish on dry land as it is for an ox to have a foal.”The messenger went back and took the answer to the King, who ordered the peasant to be brought to him and told him that this was not his own idea, and he wanted to know whose it was?The peasant must confess this at once.The peasant, however, would not do so, and said always, God forbid he should!the idea was his own.They laid him, however, on a heap of straw, and beat him and tormented him so long that at last he admitted that he had got the idea from the Queen."
"国王再回到家的时候，便质问妻子：“你怎么能这么欺骗我？我再也不要你做我的妻子了。你的时到了，回到当初你来的地方去，回到那个农家木屋去。”但他也留给她最后一点恩赐：她可以带走一件她眼中最最珍贵的东西，这样她便可以离开了。她回答说：“好的，我亲爱的丈夫。如果你这么要求，我就会这么做的。”接着她拥抱、亲吻了他，并说要带他走。然后她命人拿来强劲的安眠药水，说要喝了好和他告别。国王喝了很多，她却只喝了一点点。很快国王就沉沉地睡着了。她见状，便叫了一个仆人，让他把国王裹进一块薄薄的白色亚麻布里，并令他把国王抬到门口的马车里，然后驾着车回到了自家的小屋。她让国王躺在自己的小床上。他睡了一天一夜都没有醒来。当他睡醒后环视四周，不禁叫道：“天哪！我这是在哪儿？”他传唤他的仆人们，却无人应答。过了一会儿，他的妻子来到他身边说到：“我尊贵的陛下啊，您说我可以带走宫中一件在我眼中最最心爱和珍贵的东西。对我来说，没有什么比您更珍贵、更心爱的了，所以我把您带来了。”国王的眼中溢满了泪水，说到：“亲爱的妻子啊，你应该是我的，我也是你的。”于是他又将她带回了皇宫并再次与她结了婚。而且，说不定现在他们还活着呢。","When the King reached home again, he said to his wife, “Why hast thou behaved so falsely to me?I will not have thee any longer for a wife; thy time is up, go back to the place from whence thou camest to thy peasant’s hut.”One favour, however, he granted her; she might take with her the one thing that was dearest and best in her eyes; and thus was she dismissed.She said, “Yes, my dear husband, if you command this, I will do it,” and she embraced him and kissed him, and said she would take leave of him.Then she ordered a powerful sleeping draught to be brought, to drink farewell to him; the King took a long draught, but she took only a little.He soon fell into a deep sleep, and when she perceived that, she called a servant and took a fair white linen cloth and wrapped the King in it, and the servant was forced to carry him into a carriage that stood before the door, and she drove with him to her own little house.She laid him in her own little bed, and he slept one day and one night without awakening, and when he awoke he looked round and said, “Good God!where am I?”He called his attendants, but none of them were there.At length his wife came to his bedside and said, “My dear lord and King, you told me I might bring away with me from the palace that which was dearest and most precious in my eyes I have nothing more precious and dear than yourself, so I have brought you with me.”Tears rose to the King’s eyes and he said, “Dear wife, thou shalt be mine and I will be thine.” and he took her back with him to the royal palace and was married again to her, and at the present time they are very likely still living."
"墓穴里的苦命孩子","The Poor Boy in the Grave"
"从前，有一个可怜的牧羊童，由于父母早逝，所以官府做主把他寄养在一个财主家里，让他们来抚养他。但财主夫妇心肠歹毒、生性贪婪且守财如命。任何人吃了他们哪怕一小片面包，他们都会很恼火。可怜的小男孩不管怎么做，都只能得到一点点食物，并且还常常挨打。","There was once a poor shepherd-boy whose father and mother were dead, and he was placed by the authorities in the house of a rich man, who was to feed him and bring him up.The man and his wife, had however, bad hearts, and were greedy and anxious about their riches, and vexed whenever any one put a morsel of their bread in his mouth.The poor young fellow might do what he liked, he got little to eat, but only so many blows the more."
"一天，他被安排照看一只母鸡和一群小鸡，但是母鸡带着小鸡们跑出了那个草草搭建的树篱。突然，一只老鹰飞速俯冲下来，抓起母鸡就飞走了。男孩喊道：“小偷！小偷！坏蛋！”他喊得声嘶力竭了。但那又能起什么作用呢？老鹰是不会把到手的猎物再送回来的。财主听到叫喊声就跑了过来。一发现母鸡不见了，他立刻暴跳如雷，把男孩狠狠地打了一顿，可怜的男孩被打得两天都动弹不得。后来，男孩又得接着照看这群小鸡。但这回更难，没有了母鸡，小鸡们总是到处乱跑。于是他想了个自认为很好的办法，把所有的小鸡都用一根绳子系在一起，这样老鹰就没法再从他那里偷走任何一只鸡了。但是他大错特错了。两天后，又累又饿的男孩不小心睡着了。老鹰又来了，它抓住了其中一只小鸡，但是由于其他小鸡都和它紧紧系在一起，老鹰就把所有的小鸡都抓走了，然后停在一棵树上，狼吞虎咽地吃了起来。农场主刚好回家，看见了这一幕，他火冒三丈。小男孩于是又挨了顿毒打，不得不在床上躺了好几天。","One day he had to watch a hen and her chickens, but she ran through a quick-set hedge with them, and a hawk darted down instantly, and carried her off through the air.The boy called, “Thief!thief!rascal!” with all the strength of his body.But what good did that do?The hawk did not bring its prey back again.The man heard the noise, and ran to the spot, and as soon as he saw that his hen was gone, he fell in a rage, and gave the boy such a beating that he could not stir for two days.Then he had to take care of the chickens without the hen, but now his difficulty was greater, for one ran here and the other there.He thought he was doing a very wise thing when he tied them all together with a string, because then the hawk would not be able to steal any of them away from him.But he was very much mistaken.After two days, worn out with running about and hunger, he fell asleep; the bird of prey came, and seized one of the chickens, and as the others were tied fast to it, it carried them all off together, perched itself on a tree, and devoured them.The farmer was just coming home, and when he saw the misfortune, he got angry and beat the boy so unmercifully that he was forced to lie in bed for several days."
"当男孩又可以下地走路的时候，农场主对他说：“你太蠢了，我不能再让你当牧童了，给我当跑差吧。”随后他派男孩带着一篮葡萄和一封信去找法官。路上，可怜的男孩又饿又渴，他忍不住偷偷吃了两串葡萄。他把篮子带到法官那里，法官读完信后就开始数葡萄的串数。数完后，他说：“少了两串葡萄。”男孩诚实地承认了少了的那两串葡萄是自己吃的，因为他实在忍受不了口渴和饥饿。法官给农场主写了封信，又向他索要同样数目的葡萄。这一回男孩去送葡萄时，也得带封信过去。他又抵挡不住饥饿、口渴的折磨，吃了其中的两串葡萄。但是这次，他先从篮子里把信取出来，放在一块石头下面，自己则坐在石头上，这样信就看不到他吃葡萄，不会出卖他了。然而，法官又让他解释葡萄为什么少了。“啊，”男孩问，“你是怎么知道葡萄少了的？信是不会知道的，因为我吃葡萄之前把它压在石头下面了。”男孩头脑如此简单，法官不禁觉得好笑。他并写信给农场主，提醒他要对男孩好一点，不能让他缺吃少喝，并且要教他如何辨别是非黑白。","When he was on his legs again, the farmer said to him, “Thou art too stupid for me, I cannot make a herdsman of thee, thou must go as errand-boy.”Then he sent him to the judge, to whom he was to carry a basketful of grapes, and he gave him a letter as well.On the way hunger and thirst tormented the unhappy boy so violently that he ate two of the bunches of grapes.He took the basket to the judge, but when the judge had read the letter, and counted the bunches he said, “Two clusters are wanting.”The boy confessed quite honestly that, driven by hunger and thirst, he had devoured the two which were wanting.The judge wrote a letter to the farmer, and asked for the same number of grapes again.These also the boy had to take to him with a letter.As he again was so extremely hungry and thirsty, he could not help it, and again ate two bunches.But first he took the letter out of the basket, put it under a stone and seated himself thereon in order that the letter might not see and betray him.The judge, however, again made him give an explanation about the missing bunches.“Ah,” said the boy, “how have you learnt that?The letter could not know about it, for I put it under a stone before I did it.”The judge could not help laughing at the boy’s simplicity, and sent the man a letter wherein he cautioned him to keep the poor boy better, and not let him want for meat and drink, and also that he was to teach him what was right and what was wrong."
"“我会教你如何辨别是非黑白的，”这个铁石心肠的财主对男孩说，“如果你想吃东西，你就必须工作；但如果你做错了事，我会用拳头好好教教你的。”","“I will soon show thee the difference,” said the hard man, “if thou wilt eat, thou must work, and if thou dost anything wrong, thou shalt be quite sufficiently taught by blows.”"
"第二天，他给男孩安排了一项很艰巨的任务。他让男孩剁碎两捆稻草喂马，并且威胁着说：“五个小时内必须剁好。”他说，“我到时就会回来，如果稻草还没有剁好的话，我会把你打得动弹不了。”农场主带着他的妻子、男仆和女佣去了一年一度的集市。除了一小块面包，他什么都没给男孩留下。男孩坐到凳子上，使出全身力气，开始剁稻草。不一会儿他觉得越来越热，就把自己的小外套脱了扔到稻草堆上。他怕到规定时间剁不完稻草，就一直不停地剁。匆忙中竟没注意到他把自己的小外套和稻草一起剁碎了。他发现的时候已经太晚了，衣服补不好了。“啊！”他哭喊道，“这下我全完了。”这可恶的家伙说得到就做得到。要是他回来发现我干了些什么，肯定会杀了我。与其那样，我还不如自己了结了。”","The next day he set him a hard task.He was to chop two bundles of straw for food for the horses, and then the man threatened: “In five hours,” said he, “I shall be back again, and if the straw is not cut to chaff by that time, I will beat thee until thou canst not move a limb.”The farmer went with his wife, the man-servant and the girl, to the yearly fair, and left nothing behind for the boy but a small bit of bread.The boy seated himself on the bench, and began to work with all his might.As he got warm over it he put his little coat off and threw it on the straw.In his terror lest he should not get done in time he kept constantly cutting, and in his haste, without noticing it, he chopped his little coat as well as the straw.He became aware of the misfortune too late; there was no repairing it.“Ah,” cried he, “now all is over with me!The wicked man did not threaten me for nothing; if he comes back and sees what I have done, he will kill me.Rather than that I will take my own life.”"
"男孩曾经听农场主的妻子说过：“我床下面有一罐毒药。”但她那样说只是防备那些贪婪的人，因为那里面装的是蜂蜜。男孩爬到床下面，拿出那个罐子，吃光了里面的东西。“我真不明白，”他说，“都说死是很痛苦的，但我感觉很甜呢。难怪农场主的妻子老是说想死。”他坐在一个小椅子上，等待死亡的降临。然而，他不但没有变虚弱，反而觉得自己吃了那瓶滋补的东西后，越来越有力了。“这不是毒药。”他想，“农场主曾说过在他放衣服的柜子里有一瓶灭苍蝇的毒药。那个应该是真的吧，能把我毒死。”然而，那个并不是灭苍蝇的毒药，而是匈牙利葡萄酒。男孩拿出那瓶酒，把它喝光了。“这种死的感觉也很甜。”他说道，但很快酒精就开始发挥作用了，他感到昏昏沉沉的，心想自己离死不远了。“我肯定是要死了，”他说，“我要去教堂墓地找一个墓穴。”他跌跌撞撞地走了出去，到了墓地，躺进一个新挖好的墓穴里。渐渐地，他就失去了知觉。附近的一个小酒馆里正在举行婚礼。他听见了音乐，以为自己到了天堂。最后，他失去了所有的意识。这个可怜的男孩再也没有醒过来。烈酒和夜里寒冷的露水夺去了他的生命，他永远躺在了那个墓穴里。","The boy had once heard the farmer’s wife say, “I have a pot with poison in it under my bed.”She, however, had only said that to keep away greedy people, for there was honey in it.The boy crept under the bed, brought out the pot, and ate all that was in it.“I do not know,” said he, “folks say death is bitter, but it tastes very sweet to me.It is no wonder that the farmer’s wife has so often longed for death.”He seated himself in a little chair, and was prepared to die.But instead of becoming weaker he felt himself strengthened by the nourishing food.“It cannot have been poison,” thought he, “but the farmer once said there was a small bottle of poison for flies in the box in which he keeps his clothes; that, no doubt, will be the true poison, and bring death to me.”It was, however, no poison for flies, but Hungarian wine.The boy got out the bottle, and emptied it.“This death tastes sweet too,” said he, but shortly after when the wine began to mount into his brain and stupefy him, he thought his end was drawing near.“I feel that I must die,” said he, “I will go away to the churchyard, and seek a grave.”He staggered out, reached the churchyard, and laid himself in a newly dug grave.He lost his senses more and more.In the neighbourhood was an inn where a wedding was being kept; when he heard the music, he fancied he was already in Paradise, until at length he lost all consciousness.The poor boy never awoke again; the heat of the strong wine and the cold night-dew deprived him of life, and he remained in the grave in which he had laid himself."
"农场主听说了男孩的死讯后十分害怕，怕被带去审问。他悲痛欲绝，昏倒在地上。他妻子当时正站在炉子旁煮着一锅滚烫的肉，见状连忙跑过去扶他。就在这时火苗窜上锅里，很快烧着了整座房子。短短几个小时之后，房子就成了一堆废墟。后来的日子，他们都在贫穷和痛苦中度过，并承受着良心的折磨。","When the farmer heard the news of the boy’s death he was terrified, and afraid of being brought to justice indeed, his distress took such a powerful hold of him that he fell fainting to the ground.His wife, who was standing on the hearth with a pan of hot fat, ran to him to help him.But the flames darted against the pan, the whole house caught fire, in a few hours it lay in ashes, and the rest of the years they had to live they passed in poverty and misery, tormented by the pangs of conscience."
"玫瑰花","The Rose"
"很久以前，有一个生活贫困的女人，她有两个孩子。年幼的那个每天都得到森林里去捡柴。有一天，当她走了很远去捡柴的时候，突然来了一个长得很结实的小孩，非常勤快地帮她捡柴，还帮她把柴拿回家；可是眨眼间，这奇怪的小孩就不见了。孩子把这件事告诉了妈妈，但妈妈起先并不相信。后来，孩子带了朵玫瑰回家，并对妈妈说，这是那个漂亮的小孩给她的，还告诉她，等到玫瑰花盛开的时候，他会再来。妈妈把玫瑰放在水里养着。一天早上，孩子迟迟不能起床，妈妈到她的床边，发现她已经离开人世，但神情却显得很快乐。就在那天早上，玫瑰花开了。","There was once a poor woman who had two children.The youngest had to go every day into the forest to fetch wood.Once when she had gone a long way to seek it, a little child, who was quite strong, came and helped her industriously to pick up the wood and carry it home, and then before a moment had passed the strange child disappeared.The child told her mother this, but at first she would not believe it.At length she brought a rose home, and told her mother that the beautiful child had given her this rose, and had told her that when it was in full bloom, he would return.The mother put the rose in water.One morning her child could not get out of bed, the mother went to the bed and found her dead, but she lay looking very happy.On the same morning, the rose was in full bloom."
"牧童","The Shepherd Boy"
"从前有个牧童，由于别人问什么问题，他都能给出巧妙的回答，因此名声远扬。那里的国王也听说了这件事，但是不相信，于是派人去传唤牧童。他对牧童说：“如果你能回答我问你的三个问题，我就把你当成我的儿子，让你和我一起住在我的皇宫里。”牧童问：“是三道什么问题？”国王说：“第一个是，大海里有多少滴水？”牧童答道：“陛下，如果您下令将地球上所有的河流都堵上，不让一滴水流向海里，直到我数完为止，我就会告诉你大海里有多少滴水。”国王说：“下一个问题是，天空中有多少星星？”牧童答道：“给我一大张白纸。”　然后他用笔在上面点了很多细点，小得几乎都看不清，更不可能数得清了。任何人看见它们都会失去视力。然后他说：“天空中的星星就像这纸上的点一样多，请数数吧。”但是没人能数得清。国王又问：“第三道题是，永恒有多少秒钟？”牧童回答：“在后波美拉尼亚有座钻石山，那山有两英里半高，两英里半宽，两英里半深；每一百年就有一只小鸟飞来磨它的喙。当整座山被它的嘴磨没时，永恒的第一秒才结束。”","There was once on a time a shepherd boy whose fame spread far and wide because of the wise answers which he gave to every question.The King of the country heard of it likewise, but did not believe it, and sent for the boy.Then he said to him, “If thou canst give me an answer to three questions which I will ask thee, I will look on thee as my own child, and thou shalt dwell with me in my royal palace.”The boy said, “What are the three questions?”The King said, “The first is, how many drops of water are there in the ocean?”The shepherd boy answered, “Lord King, if you will have all the rivers on earth dammed up so that not a single drop runs from them into the sea until I have counted it, I will tell you how many drops there are in the sea.”The King said, “The next question is, how many stars are there in the sky?”The shepherd boy said, “Give me a great sheet of white paper,” and then he made so many fine points on it with a pen that they could scarcely be seen, and it was all but impossible to count them; any one who looked at them would have lost his sight.Then he said, “There are as many stars in the sky as there are points on the paper; just count them.”But no one was able to do it.The King said, “The third question is, how many seconds of time are there in eternity.”Then said the shepherd boy, “In Lower Pomerania is the Diamond Mountain, which is two miles and a half high, two miles and a half wide, and two miles and a half in depth; every hundred years a little bird comes and sharpens its beak on it, and when the whole mountain is worn away by this, then the first second of eternity will be over.”"
"国王说：“你像智者一样回答了我的三个问题，以后你就和我一起住在宫里，我把你视若自己的儿子。”","The King said, “Thou hast answered the three questions like a wise man, and shalt henceforth dwell with me in my royal palace, and I will regard thee as my own child.”"
"穿小寿衣的孩子","The Shroud"
"从前有位母亲，她的儿子七岁大了，这小男孩又漂亮又可爱，谁见了他都很喜欢。他的母亲把他视若珍宝，看得比世上一切东西都重要。碰巧这孩子突然生了场大病，上帝把他接到了自己身边。母亲伤心极了，怎么也没办法平复过来，只是日日夜夜地伤心痛哭。就在小孩下葬后不久的夜里，他又出现在生前坐着和玩耍的地方了。母亲哭他也哭，天一亮就不见踪影。可是，母亲还是哭泣不止。一天夜里，小男孩又回来了，穿着棺材里裹着他的那件白色小寿衣，头戴一个小花环，站在床上，在他母亲的脚边说道：“哎呀，妈妈，你别再哭了。你的眼泪都会落在我的寿衣上，你一直哭它就没法干，我就永远没法睡着啊。”母亲听到这话，很担心孩子，就再也不哭了。第二天夜里，小男孩又回来了，手里提着一盏小灯，对他母亲说：“妈妈，看，我的寿衣快干了，我能在坟墓里休息了。”母亲把悲伤交由上帝保管，并坚强地默默忍受着痛苦。小男孩再也没回来过，他已在他地下的小床上安息了。","There was once a mother who had a little boy of seven years old, who was so handsome and lovable that no one could look at him without liking him, and she herself worshipped him above everything in the world.Now it so happened that he suddenly became ill, and God took him to himself; and for this the mother could not be comforted, and wept both day and night.But soon afterwards, when the child had been buried, it appeared by night in the places where it had sat and played during its life, and if the mother wept, it wept also, and when morning came it disappeared.As, however, the mother would not stop crying, it came one night, in the little white shroud in which it had been laid in its coffin, and with its wreath of flowers round its head, and stood on the bed at her feet, and said, “Oh, mother, do stop crying, or I shall never fall asleep in my coffin, for my shroud will not dry because of all thy tears, which fall upon it.”The mother was afraid when she heard that, and wept no more.The next night the child came again, and held a little light in its hand, and said, “Look, mother, my shroud is nearly dry, and I can rest in my grave.”Then the mother gave her sorrow into God’s keeping, and bore it quietly and patiently, and the child came no more, but slept in its little bed beneath the earth."

"从前有个女孩，她很小的时候父母就去世了。女孩的教母孤零零地住在村头的一所小房子里，她靠纺线、织布和做针线活维持自己的生活。教母收养了这个孤苦伶仃的女孩，教会她纺织、缝纫，并在各方面教导她做一个好人。女孩15岁那年，老太太病倒了。她把女孩叫到床边，对她说：“亲爱的女儿，我快不行了。我把这个小房子留给你遮风挡雨，把纺锤、梭子和针留给你，你可以用它们维持生计。”接着她把手放到女孩头上，为她祈福，说道：“心中时刻想着上帝的仁爱，你将会幸福安好！”说完，老太太闭上眼睛离开了人世。在埋葬老人时，女孩跟在棺材后面伤心地哭泣，并献上了她最后的敬意。现在小房子里只剩下女孩一个人了。她很勤快，每天纺线、织布、缝缝补补。善良的老太太的祝福都得到了应验。小屋里的亚麻布似乎自动增多了起来，而且每当她织完一块布或一块地毯，或者做完一件衣服，她总能立刻就找到买主并卖个好价钱。这样一来，她不但衣食无忧，甚至还常常救济他人。","There was once a girl whose father and mother died while she was still a little child.All alone, in a small house at the end of the village, dwelt her godmother, who supported herself by spinning, weaving, and sewing.The old woman took the forlorn child to live with her, kept her to her work, and educated her in all that is good.When the girl was fifteen years old, the old woman became ill, called the child to her bedside, and said, “Dear daughter, I feel my end drawing near.I leave thee the little house, which will protect thee from wind and weather, and my spindle, shuttle, and needle, with which thou canst earn thy bread.”Then she laid her hands on the girl’s head, blessed her, and said, “Only preserve the love of God in thy heart, and all will go well with thee.”Thereupon she closed her eyes, and when she was laid in the earth, the maiden followed the coffin, weeping bitterly, and paid her the last mark of respect.And now the maiden lived quite alone in the little house, and was industrious, and span, wove, and sewed, and the blessing of the good old woman was on all that she did.It seemed as if the flax in the room increased of its own accord, and whenever she wove a piece of cloth or carpet, or had made a shirt, she at once found a buyer who paid her amply for it, so that she was in want of nothing, and even had something to share with others."
"这段时间，王子正在全国四处巡游，想要寻觅一位新娘。他不想选个穷女孩做新娘，也不想找个富家小姐。于是，他说道：“我要娶一位最贫穷但同时又是最富有的姑娘为妻。”当他走到女孩住的这个村庄时，跟在其他地方一样，他向村民们打听谁是村里最富有又最贫穷的女孩。村民们首先说起了村里最富的小姐，接着，他们说最穷的女孩住在村子尽头的那所小房子里。那位富家小姐身着华服，坐在她家房门前。当王子走近时，她起身迎接，给他行礼。王子看了看她，什么都没说便上马离开了。当他来到最穷的女孩屋前时，女孩没有站在门口，而是坐在自己的小屋里。王子勒马驻足，此时耀眼的阳光正照射着窗户，王子透过窗户看到女孩正坐在纺车前忙碌地纺线。女孩抬起头，当她发现王子正朝屋里望时，她的脸变得绯红，于是她赶紧垂下眼帘继续干活。至于那时她的线纺得是不是均匀，那就不得而知了。不过她始终在纺线，直到王子离开。随后，她走到窗前，打开窗子，说道：“屋里好热啊！”但是她却一直目送着王子的背影远去，直到她看不清他帽子上的白羽毛为止。女孩又回到自己的小屋里，坐下继续纺线。这时，老太太以前干活时反复说过的话突然闪现在她脑海，于是她自己唱了起来：","About this time, the son of the King was travelling about the country looking for a bride.He was not to choose a poor one, and did not want to have a rich one.So he said, “She shall be my wife who is the poorest, and at the same time the richest.”When he came to the village where the maiden dwelt, he inquired, as he did wherever he went, who was the richest and also the poorest girl in the place?They first named the richest; the poorest, they said, was the girl who lived in the small house quite at the end of the village.The rich girl was sitting in all her splendour before the door of her house, and when the prince approached her, she got up, went to meet him, and made him a low curtsey.He looked at her, said nothing, and rode on.When he came to the house of the poor girl, she was not standing at the door, but sitting in her little room.He stopped his horse, and saw through the window, on which the bright sun was shining, the girl sitting at her spinning-wheel, busily spinning.She looked up, and when she saw that the prince was looking in, she blushed all over her face, let her eyes fall, and went on spinning.I do not know whether, just at that moment, the thread was quite even; but she went on spinning until the King’s son had ridden away again.Then she went to the window, opened it, and said, “It is so warm in this room!” but she still looked after him as long as she could distinguish the white feathers in his hat.Then she sat down to work again in her own room and went on with her spinning, and a saying which the old woman had often repeated when she was sitting at her work, came into her mind, and she sang these words to herself,—"
"“纺锤，纺锤，快快出去，听我祈祷，将那求婚者带到我屋里。”","“Spindle, my spindle, haste, haste thee away, And here to my house bring the wooer, I pray.”"
"你猜怎么着？眨眼间，纺锤从她手中跳了出去，蹦蹦跳跳地离开了屋子。她惊奇地站起身，跟在后面看到底是怎么回事。她看到纺锤欢快地跳跃到了广阔的田野里，后面拖着闪亮的金线。没过多久，纺锤完全地消失在她的视线中。女孩失去了纺锤，于是她拿起了梭子，坐到织布机前开始织布。","And what do you think happened?The spindle sprang out of her hand in an instant, and out of the door, and when, in her astonishment, she got up and looked after it, she saw that it was dancing out merrily into the open country, and drawing a shining golden thread after it.Before long, it had entirely vanished from her sight.As she had now no spindle, the girl took the weaver’s shuttle in her hand, sat down to her loom, and began to weave."
"纺锤一直向前蹦啊蹦啊，然而正当线快到头的时候追上了王子。“我看到了什么啊？”王子喊了一声，“这只纺锤肯定是想做我的向导！”于是他掉转马头，顺着金线往回走。而女孩仍然坐在那里忙着织布，边织边唱道：","The spindle, however, danced continually onwards, and just as the thread came to an end, reached the prince.“What do I see?” he cried; “the spindle certainly wants to show me the way!” turned his horse about, and rode back with the golden thread.The girl was, however, sitting at her work singing,"
"“梭子，梭子，今日纺好线，听我祈祷，将那求婚者带到我身边。”","“Shuttle, my shuttle, weave well this day, And guide the wooer to me, I pray.”"
"梭子立即从她手中跳了出去，蹦到门外去了。然而，在跳出门槛前，梭子就开始织起了地毯。这地毯如此精美，世间罕见。地毯的两边织着盛开的百合和玫瑰，中间金色的底上有绿色的藤蔓向上攀爬；藤蔓下一群小兔子跳跃着，藤蔓间一只只小鹿伸出脑袋；各种艳丽的鸟儿栖息枝头，活灵活现，就差真能唱歌了。梭子蹦过来，跳过去，一切似乎都自动生成着。","Immediately the shuttle sprang out of her hand and out by the door.Before the threshold, however, it began to weave a carpet which was more beautiful than the eyes of man had ever yet beheld.Lilies and roses blossomed on both sides of it, and on a golden ground in the centre green branches ascended, under which bounded hares and rabbits, stags and deer stretched their heads in between them, brightly-coloured birds were sitting in the branches above; they lacked nothing but the gift of song.The shuttle leapt hither and thither, and everything seemed to grow of its own accord."
"没有了梭子，女孩就坐下来缝缝补补。她将针捏在手里，又唱道：","As the shuttle had run away, the girl sat down to sew.She held the needle in her hand and sang,"
"“针儿，针儿，尖又细，将屋子收拾干净，迎接求婚者。”","“Needle, my needle, sharp-pointed and fine, Prepare for a wooer this house of mine.”"
"接着针从她手指间跳下来，在屋里如同闪电般来回飞旋。屋里就好像有看不见的精灵不停地忙碌着。一瞬间，桌子和长凳上就罩上了绿色的布，椅子上覆盖了天鹅绒，窗户上挂起了丝绸的窗帘。就在针刚刚完成最后一针时，女孩便透过窗户看到了王子帽子上的白羽毛。是纺锤用金线把王子带回来了。王子飞身下马，走过地毯进了屋里。他进来看到女孩站在那里，衣着朴素却光彩照人，正如绿叶丛中盛开的玫瑰。“你正是我寻找的最贫穷又最富有的心上人。”王子对她说，“跟我一起走吧，做我的新娘。”女孩没有说话，而是向他伸出了手。王子吻了女孩，领她走出小屋，抱她上马，带她回到了王宫，并在王宫中兴高采烈地举行了盛大的婚礼。纺锤、梭子和针被授予了极高的荣誉，珍藏于宝库之中。","Then the needle leapt out of her fingers, and flew everywhere about the room as quick as lightning.It was just as if invisible spirits were working; they covered tables and benches with green cloth in an instant, and the chairs with velvet, and hung the windows with silken curtains.Hardly had the needle put in the last stitch than the maiden saw through the window the white feathers of the prince, whom the spindle had brought thither by the golden thread.He alighted, stepped over the carpet into the house, and when he entered the room, there stood the maiden in her poor garments, but she shone out from within them like a rose surrounded by leaves.“Thou art the poorest and also the richest,” said he to her.“Come with me, thou shalt be my bride.”She did not speak, but she gave him her hand.Then he gave her a kiss, led her forth, lifted her on to his horse, and took her to the royal castle, where the wedding was solemnized with great rejoicings.The spindle, shuttle, and needle were preserved in the treasure-chamber, and held in great honour."
"善良的回报","The Star-Money"
"从前，有一个小女孩，爸爸妈妈都死了。她十分贫穷，既没有屋子可以住，也没有床可以睡。后来，除了身上穿的衣服和手里的一丁点面包，她就什么都没有了，那点面包还是一位好心人给的。尽管如此，她仍然善良而虔诚。被整个世界所抛弃的她，走向原野，心中仍信仰着仁慈的上帝。后来，一个穷人碰见了她，就对她说：“啊，给我点儿吃的吧，我实在太饿了！”她把面包全都给了他，说道：“请享用吧，愿上帝保佑您！”然后继续往前走。接着，一个小孩向她走来，呜咽着说：“我的头冷极了，给我点儿东西把头包着吧。”于是，她取下自己的兜帽给了他。她走了没多远，又遇到一个小孩。那孩子没有外套，都快冻僵了。她便把自己的外套给了出去；没走多远，有人向她乞讨一件连衣裙，她把裙子也给了出去。最后，她走进了一片森林，这时天已经黑了，又有一个孩子走了过来，向她要衬衫。善良的小女孩暗自想道：“现在已经是晚上，没人会看见我，我还是可以把衬衫给出去的。”于是，她就脱下衬衫给了那孩子。她站在那里，一丁点东西都不剩了。突然，一些星星从天上落下来，变成了坚硬光滑的钱币；尽管她刚才给出了自己的衬衫，现在，她却又有了一件用上好亚麻布做成的新衬衫。她捡起钱币放进衬裙里。从那以后，她一生都过着富足的日子。","There was once on a time a little girl whose father and mother were dead, and she was so poor that she no longer had any little room to live in, or bed to sleep in, and at last she had nothing else but the clothes she was wearing and a little bit of bread in her hand which some charitable soul had given her.She was, however, good and pious.And as she was thus forsaken by all the world, she went forth into the open country, trusting in the good God.Then a poor man met her, who said, “Ah, give me something to eat, I am so hungry!”She reached him the whole of her piece of bread, and said, “May God bless it to thy use,” and went onwards.Then came a child who moaned and said, “My head is so cold, give me something to cover it with.”So she took off her hood and gave it to him; and when she had walked a little farther, she met another child who had no jacket and was frozen with cold.Then she gave it her own; and a little farther on one begged for a frock, and she gave away that also.At length she got into a forest and it had already become dark, and there came yet another child, and asked for a little shirt, and the good little girl thought to herself, “It is a dark night and no one sees thee, thou canst very well give thy little shirt away,” and took it off, and gave away that also.And as she so stood, and had not one single thing left, suddenly some stars from heaven fell down, and they were nothing else but hard smooth pieces of money, and although she had just given her little shirt away, she had a new one which was of the very finest linen.Then she gathered together the money into this, and was rich all the days of her life."
"三片羽毛","The Three Feathers"
"从前有一位国王，他有三个儿子，大儿子和二儿子都聪明机智，但是三儿子却不怎么说话，还呆头呆脑的，大家都叫他“小笨蛋”。国王日渐苍老，身体也越来越虚弱，他开始考虑后事，可他不确定自己百年之后，应该让哪个孩子继承王位。于是他对三个儿子说：“你们出宫去吧，谁把世上最精美的地毯带回来给我，谁就能在我百年之后继承王位。”为了避免他们起争执，国王把他们领到王宫外面，将三片羽毛吹到半空中，说道：“羽毛飞到什么地方，你们就去什么地方。”一片羽毛向东飞去，另一片向西飞去，第三片羽毛一直朝前飞去，不久便在不远处落了下来。于是老大向东走，老二向西走，他们还取笑“小笨蛋”，因为他不得不留在第三片羽毛落下来的地方。“小笨蛋”坐在地上，十分伤心，突然他发现羽毛的附近有一道通往地下的活板门。他掀起活板门，发现下面有台阶。他顺着台阶走下去，又来到另一扇门前。他敲了敲门，听到有人在里面喊道：","There was once on a time a King who had three sons, of whom two were clever and wise, but the third did not speak much, and was simple, and was called the Simpleton.When the King had become old and weak, and was thinking of his end, he did not know which of his sons should inherit the kingdom after him.Then he said to them, “Go forth, and he who brings me the most beautiful carpet shall be King after my death.”And that there should be no dispute amongst them, he took them outside his castle, blew three feathers in the air, and said, “You shall go as they fly.”One feather flew to the east, the other to the west, but the third flew straight up and did not fly far, but soon fell to the ground.And now one brother went to the right, and the other to the left, and they mocked Simpleton, who was forced to stay where the third feather had fallen.He sat down and was sad, then all at once he saw that there was a trap-door close by the feather.He raised it up, found some steps, and went down them, and then he came to another door, knocked at it, and heard somebody inside calling ,"
"“青衣小姑娘，到处蹦又跳；","“Little green maiden small, Hopping hither and thither;"
"跳到门口瞧一瞧，谁在把门敲。”","Hop to the door, And quickly see who is there.”"
"门打开了，他看到一只胖乎乎的大蛤蟆坐在屋里，身边有一群小蛤蟆。大胖蛤蟆问“小笨蛋”想要什么东西。他答道：“我想要世上最美丽、最精致的地毯。”大胖蛤蟆叫来一只小蛤蟆，说道：","The door opened, and he saw a great, fat toad sitting, and round about her a crowd of little toads.The fat toad asked what he wanted?He answered, “I should like to have the prettiest and finest carpet in the world.”Then she called a young one and said,"
"“青衣小姑娘，到处蹦又跳，","“Little green maiden small, Hopping hither and thither,"
"快快跳起来，拿我宝盒来。”","Hop quickly and bring meThe great box here.”"
"小蛤蟆取来了盒子，大胖蛤蟆打开盒盖，取出了一块地毯给“小笨蛋”。这块地毯是如此美丽，如此精致，这世上没有人能编织出那么精美的地毯。“小笨蛋”谢过大蛤蟆，又回到地面上来。然而，“小笨蛋”的两个兄长认为他们的弟弟傻头傻脑的，肯定什么也找不到，只会空手而归。他们说：“我们干吗费那么大劲去找地毯？”他们从各自途中最初遇到的牧羊人的妻子那里，分别要了些粗布手帕，便带回家去见国王了。这时候“小笨蛋”也回到了宫中。他带回了精美的地毯。国王看了以后，十分惊讶地说：“公正地说，应当由老三继承王位。”可是两个兄长把他们的父亲搅得不得安宁。他们说“小笨蛋”什么都不懂，根本没法当国王。他们恳请国王再出一个题目。国王便说道：“谁把世上最精美的戒指带回来给我，谁就继承王位。”他把三个儿子叫到外面，将三片羽毛吹到空中，让三个儿子跟着羽毛走。两个兄长仍旧一个向东走，一个向西走，而“小笨蛋”的那根羽毛径直地向天上飞去，又落到了那扇通往地下的活板门旁。他又走进去找大胖蛤蟆，说他想要世上最精美的戒指。大胖蛤蟆立刻命令小蛤蟆拿来了她的大盒子，从里面取出一枚戒指交给了王子。戒指上镶嵌着闪闪发光的宝石，世上没有哪个金匠能打造出这么精美的戒指。两个兄长嘲笑“小笨蛋”也想找金戒指。他们毫不费事地找来一个旧车轮，只是拔掉车轮上的铁钉，便带着它去见国王了。等“小笨蛋”取出他找到的金戒指，国王又一次说道：“王位由他继承。”两个兄长不停地纠缠着国王，直到他出了第三个题目。国王宣布谁把最美丽的姑娘领回宫，王国就归谁所有。他又一次将三片羽毛吹向空中，羽毛又像前两次那样飞了出去。","The young toad brought the box, and the fat toad opened it, and gave Simpleton a carpet out of it, so beautiful and so fine, that on the earth above, none could have been woven like it.Then he thanked her, and ascended again.The two others had, however, looked on their youngest brother as so stupid that they believed he would find and bring nothing at all.“Why should we give ourselves a great deal of trouble to search?” said they, and got some coarse handkerchiefs from the first shepherds’ wives whom they met, and carried them home to the King.At the same time Simpleton also came back, and brought his beautiful carpet, and when the King saw it he was astonished, and said, “If justice be done, the kingdom belongs to the youngest.”But the two others let their father have no peace, and said that it was impossible that Simpleton, who in everything lacked understanding, should be King, and entreated him to make a new agreement with them.Then the father said, “He who brings me the most beautiful ring shall inherit the kingdom,” and led the three brothers out, and blew into the air three feathers, which they were to follow.Those of the two eldest again went east and west, and Simpleton’s feather flew straight up, and fell down near the door into the earth.Then he went down again to the fat toad, and told her that he wanted the most beautiful ring.She at once ordered her great box to be brought, and gave him a ring out of it, which sparkled with jewels, and was so beautiful that no goldsmith on earth would have been able to make it.The two eldest laughed at Simpleton for going to seek a golden ring.They gave themselves no trouble, but knocked the nails out of an old carriage-ring, and took it to the King; but when Simpleton produced his golden ring, his father again said, “The kingdom belongs to him.”The two eldest did not cease from tormenting the King until he made a third condition, and declared that the one who brought the most beautiful woman home, should have the kingdom.He again blew the three feathers into the air, and they flew as before."
"“小笨蛋”立刻走到地下去找大胖蛤蟆。他说道：“我想要世上最漂亮的姑娘，我要把她带回王宫去！”“噢，”大胖蛤蟆答道，“最漂亮的姑娘！她现在没在这里，可你仍然能得到她。”大胖蛤蟆给了他一棵黄色的空心芜菁菜，让六只老鼠拉了过来。“小笨蛋”发愁地说：“我该怎么做呢？”大胖蛤蟆答道：“你只要在我的小蛤蟆里捉一只，放在菜里就行了。”于是“小笨蛋”随手捉了一只小蛤蟆放进去。就在被放进去的一瞬间，小蛤蟆变成了一位美丽绝伦的姑娘，芜菁菜变成了一架大马车，六只老鼠变成了六匹马。“小笨蛋”吻了吻姑娘，便迅速地驾着马车，带她回宫去见国王了。他的兄长们随后也回到了宫中。他们并没费劲去找漂亮的姑娘，而是把各自在路上碰到的第一个村姑领回了王宫。国王见过他们之后说：“我死后，王位由老三继承。”可是两个兄长再度开始吵吵嚷嚷，国王的耳朵都快被他们吵聋了。他们说道：“我们不同意由‘小笨蛋’来继承王位。”他们还逼老国王出新的题目：谁带回的姑娘能从大厅中悬挂的那只铁环里跳过去，谁就继承王位。他们想：“村姑身体壮实，跳过去轻而易举；而那位弱不禁风的姑娘准会被摔死。”年迈的国王同样也答应了。于是两个村姑开始跳，虽然她们跳过了铁环，可是她们太胖了，摔倒在地上，摔断了粗壮的胳膊和腿。然后轮到“小笨蛋”领回来的漂亮姑娘了。她像只小鹿一样轻盈地从铁环中跳了过去。这回谁也无法提出异议了。这样，“小笨蛋”终于继承了王位。在这以后的很长一段时间里，他英明地统治着这个国家。","Then Simpleton without more ado went down to the fat toad, and said, “I am to take home the most beautiful woman!”“Oh,” answered the toad, “the most beautiful woman!She is not at hand at the moment, but still thou shalt have her.”She gave him a yellow turnip which had been hollowed out, to which six mice were harnessed.Then Simpleton said quite mournfully, “What am I to do with that?”The toad answered, “Just put one of my little toads into it.”Then he seized one at random out of the circle, and put her into the yellow coach, but hardly was she seated inside it than she turned into a wonderfully beautiful maiden, and the turnip into a coach, and the six mice into horses.So he kissed her, and drove off quickly with the horses, and took her to the King.His brothers came afterwards; they had given themselves no trouble at all to seek beautiful girls, but had brought with them the first peasant women they chanced to meet.When the King saw them he said, “After my death the kingdom belongs to my youngest son.”But the two eldest deafened the King’s ears afresh with their clamour, “We cannot consent to Simpleton’s being King,” and demanded that the one whose wife could leap through a ring which hung in the centre of the hall should have the preference.They thought, “The peasant women can do that easily; they are strong enough, but the delicate maiden will jump herself to death.”The aged King agreed likewise to this.Then the two peasant women jumped, and jumped through the ring, but were so stout that they fell, and their coarse arms and legs broke in two.And then the pretty maiden whom Simpleton had brought with him, sprang, and sprang through as lightly as a deer, and all opposition had to cease.So he received the crown, and has ruled wisely for a length of time."
"三个懒鬼","The Three Sluggards"
"从前，有一位国王，他有三个儿子。他爱他们每一个人，所以不知道在他死之后应该把王位传给谁。终于，在他快要死的时候，他把他的三个儿子召唤到他的床前，说道：“亲爱的孩子们，我一直在考虑一件事，今天我就宣布：你们当中最懒的一个将继承我的王位。”大儿子说道：“父王，王位是我的，因为我懒到如果我躺下来休息，一滴水滴到我的眼睛里，我都不会睁眼，继续睡。”二儿子说道：“父王，王位是我的，因为我非常懒，当我烤火时，我宁肯让火把我的膝盖烧坏，也不会把腿缩回来。”三儿子说道：“父王，王位传给我才对，因为我很懒。如果我快要被处以绞刑了，绳子已经捆着我的脖子，有人把一个锋利的刀子送到我的手里，我可以用它割断绳索；我宁愿让自己被绞死也懒得举起手把绳子割断。”国王听完三儿子的话，说道：“确实没有人比你更懒了，那么就由你来继承我的王位吧。”","A certain King had three sons who were all equally dear to him, and he did not know which of them to appoint as his successor after his own death.When the time came when he was about to die, he summoned them to his bedside and said, “Dear children, I have been thinking of something which I will declare unto you; whichsoever of you is the laziest shall have the kingdom.”The eldest said, “Then, father, the kingdom is mine, for I am so idle that if I lie down to rest, and a drop falls in my eye, I will not open it that I may sleep.”The second said; “Father, the kingdom belongs to me, for I am so idle that when I am sitting by the fire warming myself, I would rather let my heel be burnt off than draw back my leg.”The third said, “Father, the kingdom is mine, for I am so idle that if I were going to be hanged, and had the rope already round my neck, and any one put a sharp knife into my hand with which I might cut the rope, I would rather let myself be hanged than raise my hand to the rope.”When the father heard that, he said, “Thou hast carried it the farthest, and shalt be King.”"
"萝卜","The Turnip"
"从前，有一对当兵的兄弟，一个很富有，而另一个却很穷。穷兄弟为了摆脱贫困，退伍当了农夫。他锄好了一小块地，撒上了萝卜种子。萝卜种子发芽后，其中一个萝卜长得又大又旺盛，而且它越长越大，就像要一直不停地长下去。或许应该叫它萝卜公主吧，因为这是个空前绝后的大萝卜。","There were once two brothers who both served as soldiers; one of them was rich, and the other poor.Then the poor one, to escape from his poverty, put off his soldier’s coat, and turned farmer.He dug and hoed his bit of land, and sowed it with turnip-seed.The seed came up, and one turnip grew there which became large and vigorous, and visibly grew bigger and bigger, and seemed as if it would never stop growing, so that it might have been called the princess of turnips, for never was such an one seen before, and never will such an one be seen again."
"最后，这萝卜大到要一辆马车才能装得下，并且得两头牛才能拉得动。这个农夫也不知道该拿这个萝卜怎么办好了，他也不清楚这对他来说是福还是祸。最后他想：“如果把它卖了，也得不到多大的好处；如果自己把它吃了，又怎么样呢，和吃小萝卜又没有什么区别。还不如把它当作礼物献给国王，这样会更好。”","At length it was so enormous that by itself it filled a whole cart, and two oxen were required to draw it, and the farmer had not the least idea what he was to do with the turnip, or whether it would be a fortune to him or a misfortune.At last he thought, “If thou sellest it, what wilt thou get for it that is of any importance, and if thou eatest it thyself, why, the small turnips would do thee just as much good; it would be better to take it to the King, and make him a present of it.”"
"于是他把萝卜装进车里，用两头牛拉着车去了皇宫，把萝卜献给了国王。“这个奇怪的东西是什么？”国王问道，“我见过很多神奇的东西，却从没见过这样的怪物！这是用什么种子种出来的，还是你运气好碰巧遇上了它？”“啊，不是的！”农夫说，“我不是什么幸运儿。我是一个穷士兵，因为没钱再维持我当兵的花销，就退伍种田了。我有一个很富有的兄弟，您肯定知道他。但是，亲爱的陛下，因为一无所有，我就被大家遗忘了。”","So he placed it on a cart, harnessed two oxen, took it to the palace, and presented it to the King.“What strange thing is this?” said the King.“Many wonderful things have come before my eyes, but never such a monster as this!From what seed can this have sprung, or are you a luck-child and have met with it by chance?”“Ah, no!” said the farmer, “no luck-child am I.I am a poor soldier, who because he could no longer support himself hung his soldier’s coat on a nail and took to farming land.I have a brother who is rich and well known to you, Lord King, but I, because I have nothing, am forgotten by every one.”"
"国王很同情他，说道：“你会摆脱贫穷的，会得到我的礼物，那样你就会跟你的兄弟一样富有了。”于是国王赐给农夫很多黄金、土地、牧场、牲畜，他变得非常富有，连他的兄弟都比不上他了。当富兄弟听说穷兄弟只用了一个萝卜就得到这么多赏赐时，非常嫉妒，于是费尽一切心机也想得到这样的好运。他用了一个更聪明的方法。他带着金子和马匹去献给国王，确保国王会回赠给他更丰厚的礼物。如果他的兄弟只用一个萝卜就能得到这么多赏赐，那他带了这么多好东西，又会得到什么样的回赠呢？国王接受了他的礼物，并说除了那个大萝卜，再没有比这更稀有、更好的东西回赠给他了。因此，富兄弟不得不把穷兄弟的萝卜放在车上带回了家。他气坏了，但不知道该向谁发泄愤怒，直到后来动了坏心，决定要杀了自己的兄弟。他雇了几个杀手准备好伏击后，便去找穷兄弟，他说道：“亲爱的兄弟，我知道一处秘密宝藏，我们一起去挖吧，然后我们两个再分。”穷兄弟同意了，就毫无疑心地跟着他一起去了。然而就在去的路上，那些杀手抓住了他，把他绑起来，并想在树上吊死他。但他们正要这样做时，远处传来了响亮的歌声和马蹄声。于是他们害怕极了，就将穷兄弟头朝下装进袋子里挂在了树枝上，然后匆忙逃跑了。然而，穷兄弟在树上不停地折腾，直到把袋子戳破了个洞，可以露出自己的脑袋。路过的不过是个外出旅行的学生，这个年轻人正骑着马穿过树林，快乐地唱着歌。当穷兄弟在上面看到有人从下面经过时，他喊道：“多好的天气啊！你真幸运，来得太巧了！”那个学生四处看了看，却不知道声音是从哪儿来的。最后他问：“是谁在叫我？”树上传来了回答的声音：“抬头看。我坐在高处的智慧袋里呢。才一会儿，我就学到了很多东西。与这相比，所有的学校不过都是些笑料。很快我就能学完所有的东西，比任何人都聪明了。我能看懂星星和星座，知道了风的踪迹，清楚海里有多少沙子，懂得了怎么治病，还了解了各种药草、鸟类和石头的特性。只要你一进来，就会感受到智慧袋里美妙之物在涌出。”","Then the King felt compassion for him, and said, “Thou shalt be raised from thy poverty, and shalt have such gifts from me that thou shalt be equal to thy rich brother.”Then he bestowed on him much gold, and lands, and meadows, and herds, and made him immensely rich, so that the wealth of the other brother could not be compared with his.When the rich brother heard what the poor one had gained for himself with one single turnip, he envied him, and thought in every way how he also could get hold of a similar piece of luck.He would, however, set about it in a much wiser way, and took gold and horses and carried them to the King, and made certain the King would give him a much larger present in return.If his brother had got so much for one turnip, what would he not carry away with him in return for such beautiful things as these?The King accepted his present, and said he had nothing to give him in return that was more rare and excellent than the great turnip.So the rich man was obliged to put his brother’s turnip in a cart and have it taken to his home.When there he did not know on whom to vent his rage and anger, until bad thoughts came to him, and he resolved to kill his brother.He hired murderers, who were to lie in ambush, and then he went to his brother and said, “Dear brother, I know of a hidden treasure, we will dig it up together, and divide it between us.”The other agreed to this, and accompanied him without suspicion.While they were on their way, however, the murderers fell on him, bound him, and would have hanged him to a tree.But just as they were doing this, loud singing and the sound of a horse’s feet were heard in the distance.On this their hearts were filled with terror, and they pushed their prisoner head first into the sack, hung it on a branch, and took to flight.He, however, worked up there until he had made a hole in the sack through which he could put his head.The man who was coming by was no other than a travelling student, a young fellow who rode on his way through the wood joyously singing his song.When he who was aloft saw that someone was passing below him, he cried, “Good day!You have come at a lucky time.”The student looked round on every side, but did not know whence the voice came.At last he said, “Who calls me?”Then an answer came from the top of the tree, “Raise your eyes; here I sit aloft in the Sack of Wisdom.In a short time have I learnt great things; compared with this all schools are a jest; in a very short time I shall have learnt everything, and shall descend wiser than all other men.I understand the stars, and the signs of the Zodiac, and the tracks of the winds, the sand of the sea, the healing of illness, and the virtues of all herbs, birds, and stones.If you were once within it you would feel what noble things issue forth from the Sack of Knowledge.”"
"听到这些时，那个学生感到非常惊讶，他说：“很庆幸我今天在这儿遇到了你！能让我也到袋子里呆一会儿吗？”穷兄弟在上面假装不情愿地说：“如果你能回报我，说些好听的话，我就让你进来呆一小会儿，但你必须再等一小时，因为在这之前我还要再学一样东西。”这个学生等了一会儿后，变得没耐心了，他的求知欲是如此地强烈，就乞求立即进入智慧袋里。上面的穷兄弟最后装作让步了，他说：“为了让我从智慧袋里出来，你必须用绳子把它降下去，然后你才能进来。”于是，那个学生把袋子降下来，打开它，放了穷兄弟后，喊道：“现在就把我挂上去吧。”并要进到袋子里去。“等会儿！”穷兄弟说道，“那样不管用的。”他按着学生的头，把他头朝下地装进袋子里，再用绳子把这个智慧的门徒送到了树上。然后他一边让他在空中晃悠一边问：“你感觉怎么样啊，我亲爱的朋友？看，你已经感觉到智慧来了，你现在正在收获宝贵的经验呢。保持绝对安静，你就会成为一个智者的。”随后，穷兄弟爬上学生的马，骑着它走了。但是一小时以后，他派人来把学生放了。","The student, when he heard all this, was astonished, and said, “Blessed be the hour in which I have found thee!May not I also enter the sack for a while?”He who was above replied as if unwillingly, “For a short time I will let you get into it, if you reward me and give me good words; but you must wait an hour longer, for one thing remains which I must learn before I do it.”When the student had waited a while he became impatient, and begged to be allowed to get in at once, his thirst for knowledge was so very great.So he who was above pretended at last to yield, and said, “In order that I may come forth from the house of knowledge you must let it down by the rope, and then you shall enter it.”So the student let the sack down, untied it, and set him free, and then cried, “Now draw me up at once,” and was about to get into the sack.“Halt!” said the other, “that won’t do,” and took him by the head and put him upside down into the sack, fastened it, and drew the disciple of wisdom up the tree by the rope.Then he swung him in the air and said, “How goes it with thee, my dear fellow?Behold, already thou feelest wisdom coming, and art gaining valuable experience.Keep perfectly quiet until thou becomest wiser.”Thereupon he mounted the student’s horse and rode away, but in an hour’s time sent some one to let the student out again."
"水妖","The Water-Nix"
"从前，姐弟俩在一口水井边玩的时候，不幸落入水中。一个水妖住在井底，她说道：“你们现在落到我手上，以后就要卖力给我干活！”　说完就把她们带走了。她让小女孩纺又脏又乱的麻，还让她用有洞的桶打水，小男孩不得不用一把钝斧头砍倒一棵树。但他们除了吃硬的像石头一样的团子外，再也没有其他可吃的。最终，孩子们受不了了，他们一直等着，终于等到一个星期天，当水妖去教堂做礼拜时，他们就逃跑了。但是，当礼拜结束后，水妖看到很多鸟儿从林中惊起，于是大步跟着它们。孩子们远远地看到她，小女孩把一把刷子扔到背后，形成了一个巨大的毛鬃山，山上长满了成千上万的长钉子。女妖为了越过去，不得不费力地爬，然而，最终她越过去了。当孩子们看到这一情况，男孩往身后扔了一把梳子；形成了有成千上万个齿的梳子山，但是女妖尽量使自己在上面保持平稳，并最终跨过去了。然后女孩往身后又扔了一面镜子，形成了一座镜子山。镜子山非常滑，使得女妖不可能跨过去。于是，她想：“我要赶快回家拿我的斧子，把这座镜子山砍成两半。”然而，在她返回并把镜子山砍断的这段时间里，孩子们早已逃到了很远的地方，水妖只能又回到了井里。","A little brother and sister were once playing by a well, and while they were thus playing, they both fell in.A water-nix lived down below, who said, “Now I have got you, now you shall work hard for me!” and carried them off with her.She gave the girl dirty tangled flax to spin, and she had to fetch water in a bucket with a hole in it, and the boy had to hew down a tree with a blunt axe, and they got nothing to eat but dumplings as hard as stones.Then at last the children became so impatient, that they waited until one Sunday, when the nix was at church, and ran away.But when church was over, the nix saw that the birds were flown, and followed them with great strides.The children saw her from afar, and the girl threw a brush behind her which formed an immense hill of bristles, with thousands and thousands of spikes, over which the nix was forced to scramble with great difficulty; at last, however, she got over.When the children saw this, the boy threw behind him a comb which made a great hill of combs with a thousand times a thousand teeth, but the nix managed to keep herself steady on them, and at last crossed over that.Then the girl threw behind her a looking-glass which formed a hill of mirrors, and was so slippery that it was impossible for the nix to cross it.Then she thought, “I will go home quickly and fetch my axe, and cut the hill of glass in half.”Long before she returned, however, and had hewn through the glass, the children had escaped to a great distance, and the water-nix was obliged to betake herself to her well again."
"篱笆国王","The Willow-Wren"
"在以前，每种声音还都有其意义和用途。当铁匠的铁锤敲响时，那回音像在喊：“击开！击开！”当木匠的刨子吱吱作响时，那声音像在喊：“走吧！走吧！”当磨粉机轮咯咯响起时，那声音像在喊：“救命啊，上帝！救命啊，上帝！”而如果磨坊主是个骗子，又碰巧离开了磨坊，它就会用高地德语先慢慢地问：“谁在那儿？谁在那儿？”然后又快速地回答：“是磨坊主！是磨坊主！”最后又急促地喊：“他竟然敢偷东西！他竟然敢偷东西！每蒲式耳里偷了三配克！”","In former days every sound still had its meaning and application.When the smith’s hammer resounded, it cried, “Strike away!strike away.”When the carpenter’s plane grated, it said, “Here goes!here goes.”If the mill wheel began to clack, it said, “Help, Lord God!help, Lord God!”And if the miller was a cheat and happened to leave the mill, it spoke high German, and first asked slowly, “Who is there?Who is there?” and then answered quickly, “The miller!the miller!” and at last quite in a hurry, “He steals bravely!he steals bravely!three pecks in a bushel.”"
"如今，鸟儿的声音听起来就像唧唧声、尖叫声，又像口哨声，在一些人听来，就像是没有歌词的音乐。而在那时候，鸟儿也有自己的语言，而且大家都能听懂。然而，鸟儿们觉得他们不能没有领导者，于是决定在他们当中选出一个国王。只有一只田凫反对这种想法。他一直自由地生活着，而且也想自由地死去，于是他焦急地飞来飞去，嚷嚷着：“我该飞向哪里？我该飞向哪里？”他飞去了一个人迹罕至的沼泽地，从此再也没在他的同伴中出现过。","At this time the birds also had their own language which every one understood; now it only sounds like chirping, screeching, and whistling, and to some like music without words.It came into the bird’s mind, however, that they would no longer be without a ruler, and would choose one of themselves to be their King.One alone amongst them, the green plover, was opposed to this.He had lived free, and would die free, and anxiously flying hither and thither, he cried, “Where shall I go?where shall I go?”He retired into a solitary and unfrequented marsh, and showed himself no more among his fellows."
"如今鸟儿们都想讨论一下这件事。于是，在五月一个晴朗的早上，他们都从田间、林中飞来，聚在一起：有老鹰、苍头燕雀、猫头鹰、乌鸦、百灵鸟、麻雀……实在不能尽举。甚至连杜鹃和他的办事员戴胜鸟也来了——之所以这么称呼他是因为他的叫声总比杜鹃的早几天。另外还有一只无名的小鸟，也跟大伙儿混在一起。母鸡碰巧对此事不知情，当她看到如此大规模的集会时，都惊呆了。“怎么啦？怎么啦？要发生什么事了？”她咯咯地叫道。深爱着她的公鸡让她平静下来，说：“只是有钱人的事！”并告诉了她所发生的事。在集会中，大家决定让飞得最高的那只鸟当国王。坐在灌木丛中的树蛙听到这个决定之后，大声警告说：“不行！不行！不行！不行！”因为他觉得很多鸟儿会为此伤心流泪的。但是乌鸦却“呱，呱”地叫着，并说一切都会顺利进行。鸟儿们决定，在那个晴朗的早上，大家都即刻起飞，这样日后就不会有谁抱怨说：“本来我能很轻松就飞得更高，只是因为天黑了，就没法再飞了。”起飞信号发出后，整个鸟群都飞向了天空。灰尘腾地而起，到处都是翅膀扇动时发出的有节奏的呼呼声，整个场面看起来就像是一片乌云升向天空。然而，体型较小的鸟儿们还是很快就被落在后面了。他们没法飞得更高了，只得折回地面。体型大一点的鸟儿可以坚持飞得再高一点，但是没有谁可以和老鹰相比。他飞得很高，都能把太阳的眼睛啄出来了。老鹰看见没有别的鸟儿追上来，心里暗想：“我都是国王了，为什么还要飞得更高呢？”于是就降下来了。比他飞得低的鸟儿立刻大声向他喊道：“你就是我们的国王了，没有人能比你飞得更高了。”“除了我！”那只无名的小鸟尖叫道。他之前悄悄地爬进了老鹰胸前的羽毛里。因为他一点也不累，所以就又向上飞去，几乎都要到达天堂了。不过，飞到这么高时，他突然合上翅膀，用响亮而清晰的声音喊道：“我才是国王！我才是国王！”","The birds now wished to discuss the matter, and on a fine May morning they all gathered together from the woods and fields: eagles and chaffinches, owls and crows, larks and sparrows, how can I name them all?Even the cuckoo came, and the hoopoe, his clerk, who is so called because he is always heard a few days before him, and a very small bird which as yet had no name, mingled with the band.The hen, which by some accident had heard nothing of the whole matter, was astonished at the great assemblage.“What, what, what is going to be done?” she cackled; but the cock calmed his beloved hen, and said, “Only rich people,” and told her what they had on hand.It was decided, however, that the one who could fly the highest should be King.A tree-frog which was sitting among the bushes, when he heard that, cried a warning, “No, no, no! no!” because he thought that many tears would be shed because of this; but the crow said, “Caw, caw,” and that all would pass off peaceably.It was now determined that on this fine morning they should at once begin to ascend, so that hereafter no one should be able to say, “I could easily have flown much higher, but the evening came on, and I could do no more.”On a given signal, therefore, the whole troop rose up in the air.The dust ascended from the land, and there was tremendous fluttering and whirring and beating of wings, and it looked as if a black cloud was rising up.The little birds were, however, soon left behind.They could go no farther, and fell back to the ground.The larger birds held out longer, but none could equal the eagle, who mounted so high that he could have picked the eyes out of the sun.And when he saw that the others could not get up to him, he thought, “Why shouldst thou fly still higher, thou art the King?” and began to let himself down again.The birds beneath him at once cried to him.“Thou must be our King, no one has flown so high as thou.”“Except me,” screamed the little fellow without a name, who had crept into the breast-feathers of the eagle.And as he was not at all tired, he rose up and mounted so high that he reached heaven itself.When, however, he had gone as far as this, he folded his wings together, and called down with clear and penetrating voice, “I am King!I am King.”"
"“你？我们的国王？”鸟儿们都愤怒地喊道。“你是耍花招才得逞的！”所以大家又提出一个条件。能够入地最深的才能当国王。鹅迅速用他那宽大的胸膛拍打着地面，因为这又是一次陆地赛！乌鸦也不甘示弱，快速地在地上刨出一个洞！鸭子表现得最糟糕了，因为她跳进了沟里，却扭伤了腿，于是她摇摇摆摆地走向旁边的一个池塘，还边走边说：“骗人的！骗人的！”然而，那只无名小鸟找到了一个老鼠洞，迅速钻进去，并用他那很小的声音使劲喊：“我是国王！我是国王！”","“Thou, our King?” cried the birds angrily.“Thou hast compassed it by trick and cunning!”So they made another condition.He should be King who could go down lowest in the ground.How the goose did flap about with its broad breast when it was once more on the land!How quickly the cock scratched a hole!The duck came off the worst of all, for she leapt into a ditch, but sprained her legs, and waddled away to a neighboring pond, crying, “Cheating, cheating!”The little bird without a name, however, sought out a mouse-hole, slipped down into it, and cried out of it with his small voice, “I am King!I am King!”"
"“你是我们的国王？”鸟儿们更加愤怒地喊道。“你觉得你那些骗人的把戏会得逞吗？”鸟儿们决定把他关在那个洞里，饿到他出洞为止。猫头鹰被选为哨兵，在洞前监视着。只要她不是个窝囊废，都不会让这只无赖跑掉的。夜幕降临时，所有的鸟儿都因白天飞得很累，跟自己的妻儿回家睡觉去了。只有猫头鹰独自在老鼠洞前坚守着岗位，用她那双大眼坚定地看着洞口。但与此同时，她也很疲倦，于是暗想：“就算闭上一只眼，我还可以用另一只眼看着。这只小恶棍可是逃不出洞的。”于是她闭上了一只眼睛，用另一只眼睛死死地盯着老鼠洞。那个小家伙悄悄探出脑袋往外偷看，想趁机逃跑。但是猫头鹰迅速冲了过去，又把他吓回了洞里。过一会儿，猫头鹰又睁开一只眼睛，闭上另一只，打算一整晚轮换着闭眼休息。","“Thou our King!” cried the birds still more angrily.“Dost thou think thy cunning shall prevail?”They determined to keep him a prisoner in the hole and starve him out.The owl was placed as sentinel in front of it, and was not to let the rascal out if she had any value for her life.When evening was come all the birds were feeling very tired after exerting their wings so much, so they went to bed with their wives and children.The owl alone remained standing by the mouse-hole, gazing steadfastly into it with her great eyes.In the meantime she, too, had grown tired and thought to herself, “You might certainly shut one eye, you will still watch with the other, and the little miscreant shall not come out of his hole.”So she shut one eye, and with the other looked straight at the mouse-hole.The little fellow put his head out and peeped, and wanted to slip away, but the owl came forward immediately, and he drew his head back again.Then the owl opened the one eye again, and shut the other, intending to shut them in turn all through the night."
"但接着，她闭上一只眼，却忘记睁开另一只了。双眼一合上，她马上就睡着了。那小家伙很快就发现猫头鹰睡着了，便趁机逃跑了。","But when she next shut the one eye, she forgot to open the other, and as soon as both her eyes were shut she fell asleep.The little fellow soon observed that, and slipped away."
"从那以后，猫头鹰再也不敢在白天出来了，因为她一出来，别的鸟就会驱赶她，拔掉她的羽毛。她到晚上才敢飞出来，并且很讨厌老鼠，不停地捉他们，因为他们造了可恶的老鼠洞。那只小鸟也不敢现身了，因为他怕自己被捉住后就没命了。他只在树篱下悄悄活动。有时，当觉得自己很安全时，他也会说：“我是国王！”因此，别的鸟儿讥讽地称他为“树篱国王”。最开心的要数百灵鸟了，因为她不用听从“树篱国王”的差遣。太阳一升起，她就会飞向高处叫道：“啊，好美啊！好美啊！好美！好美！啊，好美啊！”","From that day forth, the owl has never dared to show herself by daylight, for if she does the other birds chase her and pluck her feathers out.She only flies out by night, but hates and pursues mice because they make such ugly holes.The little bird, too, is very unwilling to let himself be seen, because he is afraid it will cost him his life if he is caught.He steals about in the hedges, and when he is quite safe, he sometimes cries, “I am King,” and for this reason, the other birds call him in mockery, ‘King of the hedges’.No one, however, was so happy as the lark at not having to obey the little King.As soon as the sun appears, she ascends high in the air and cries, “Ah, how beautiful that is!beautiful that is!beautiful, beautiful!ah, how beautiful that is!”"
