"于吾国吾家，我无话可说。时光荏苒，岁月无情，如今我背井离乡，疏远了家人。世袭的财产使我能够获得非凡的教育，而善于沉思的头脑又使我能够将早年勤奋习得的知识梳理捋顺。所习之物中，德国伦理学家的著作，我最是乐之；并非出于盲目崇拜他们雄辩的疯狂，而恰是由于我思路清晰的习惯，使我能轻而易举地察觉他们的虚伪之处。我常因天赋匮乏而遭诟病；而想象力缺乏亦被列为我的罪过，至于我思想中的怀疑论，更是使我声名狼藉。其实，我担心，由于对物理哲学的热爱，我脑中已被注入了这个年代的普遍错误——我指的是将偶然事件，即便是毫无关联之事追溯到某门科学原理的习惯。总之，没有人比我更难被蛊惑人心的迷信从残酷的现实中拖离。我觉得有必要先在此啰唆一番，以免我将要讲述的难以置信之事被认为是凭空臆想的胡言乱语，而非是本人——一个没有想象能力的人的亲身经历。","OF my country and of my family I have little to say.Ill usage and length of years have driven me from the one, and estranged me from the other.Hereditary wealth afforded me an education of no common order, and a contemplative turn of mind enabled me to methodize the stores which early study very diligently garnered up.—Beyond all things, the study of the German moralists gave me great delight; not from any ill-advised admiration of their eloquent madness, but from the ease with which my habits of rigid thought enabled me to detect their falsities.I have often been reproached with the aridity of my genius; a deficiency of imagination has been imputed to me as a crime; and the Pyrrhonism of my opinions has at all times rendered me notorious.Indeed, a strong relish for physical philosophy has, I fear, tinctured my mind with a very common error of this age—I mean the habit of referring occurrences, even the least susceptible of such reference, to the principles of that science.Upon the whole, no person could be less liable than myself to be led away from the severe precincts of truth by the ignes fatui of superstition.I have thought proper to premise thus much, lest the incredible tale I have to tell should be considered rather the raving of a crude imagination, than the positive experience of a mind to which the reveries of fancy have been a dead letter and a nullity."
"我在国外游荡了多年。一八几几年，我从位于富饶且人口众多的爪洼岛上的巴达维亚港出发，出海前往巽他群岛。我以乘客的身份出发了——并没有什么其他原因，只因我总感觉焦躁不安，而且这种焦灼如鬼魅般缠上了我。","After many years spent in foreign travel, I sailed in the year 18—, from the port of Batavia, in the rich and populous island of Java, on a voyage to the Archipelago of the Sunda islands.I went as passenger—having no other inducement than a kind of nervous restlessness which haunted me as a fiend."
"我们的船很漂亮，约重四百吨，镶着黄铜，是在孟买用马拉巴的柚木制造的。船上装了拉克代夫群岛的棉织品和油料。此外还有椰子壳纤维、椰子糖、酥油、椰子和几箱鸦片。货物装得很是潦草，因此船经常摇来晃去的。","Our vessel was a beautiful ship of about four hundred tons, copper-fastened, and built at Bombay of Malabar teak.She was freighted with cotton-wool and oil, from the Lachadive islands.We had also on board coir, jaggeree, ghee, cocoa-nuts, and a few cases of opium.The stowage was clumsily done, and the vessel consequently crank."
"我们起航时海上仅有微风阵阵，在爪哇的东海岸航行了很多天，没有什么事情可以消磨旅途中的无聊时光，唯有偶见一些自我们的目的地巽他群岛开来的小帆船。","We got under way with a mere breath of wind, and for many days stood along the eastern coast of Java, without any other incident to beguile the monotony of our course than the occasional meeting with some of the small grabs of the Archipelago to which we were bound."
"一天傍晚，我斜靠在船尾的栏杆上，望着西北方一朵形单影只的云彩。自离开巴达维亚以来，这是第一次看到云彩，且它的颜色也特别，便显得引人注意。我凝神遥望，直到夕阳西下。那时，那片云彩忽然向东西两边蔓延开来，在天水相连处形成一道窄窄的烟霞，看似一条长长的浅滩线。不多时，我的注意力便被暗红色的月亮和海上奇异景观所吸引。大海正快速变化着，海水呈现出一种不同寻常的透明。此时竟能清晰地看到海底，但我抛下铅陲一量，发现船下海水居然有15英寻之深。此时空气变得酷热难当，暑气氤氲盘旋，和从灼热的铁块上冒出来的并无二致。夜幕降临，仅有的一丝微风也消失殆尽，四周是难以想象的寂静。船尾上燃着的烛火纹丝不动，用食指和拇指捏着一根长发，也不见它有丝毫摆动。不过，船长说他没察觉到任何危险的迹象，而且我们整体也在向逐渐靠向岸边，因此他下令收起风帆，抛下铁锚。没有安排守夜人。水手们大多是马来人，在甲板上伸展着身子悠哉地躺下了。我下到船舱里，满是不祥的预感。说真的，我觉得所有的迹象都表明，西蒙风即将到来。我将担忧告诉船长，但他对我所说的不屑一顾，甚至懒得回答我一句就转身离去。我很是不安，难以入睡。大约午夜时分光景，我上了甲板。我刚将脚踏上舱室扶梯的最上面一阶，就被一阵巨大的嗡嗡声吓了一跳，那就像是水车轮子飞速转动的声音。我还没弄清楚是怎么回事，就发现船身由中心开始震动起来了。紧接着，一个巨浪朝船梁末端打来，一波接一波地同时攻向船头和船尾，洗劫了整个甲板。 ","One evening, leaning over the taffrail, I observed a very singular, isolated cloud, to the N.W.It was remarkable, as well for its color, as from its being the first we had seen since our departure from Batavia.I watched it attentively until sunset, when it spread all at once to the eastward and westward, girting in the horizon with a narrow strip of vapor, and looking like a long line of low beach.My notice was soon afterwards attracted by the dusky-red appearance of the moon, and the peculiar character of the sea.The latter was undergoing a rapid change, and the water seemed more than usually transparent.Although I could distinctly see the bottom, yet, heaving the lead, I found the ship in fifteen fathoms.The air now became intolerably hot, and was loaded with spiral exhalations similar to those arising from heat iron.As night came on, every breath of wind died away, an more entire calm it is impossible to conceive.The flame of a candle burned upon the poop without the least perceptible motion, and a long hair, held between the finger and thumb, hung without the possibility of detecting a vibration.However, as the captain said he could perceive no indication of danger, and as we were drifting in bodily to shore, he ordered the sails to be furled, and the anchor let go.No watch was set, and the crew, consisting principally of Malays, stretched themselves deliberately upon deck.I went below—not without a full presentiment of evil.Indeed, every appearance warranted me in apprehending a Simoom.I told the captain my fears; but he paid no attention to what I said, and left me without deigning to give a reply.My uneasiness, however, prevented me from sleeping, and about midnight I went upon deck.—As I placed my foot upon the upper step of the companion-ladder, I was startled by a loud, humming noise, like that occasioned by the rapid revolution of a mill-wheel, and before I could ascertain its meaning, I found the ship quivering to its centre.In the next instant, a wilderness of foam hurled us upon our beam-ends, and, rushing over us fore and aft, swept the entire decks from stem to stern."
"从很大程度上说，却正是那排凶猛的巨浪拯救了我们的船只。虽然整条船已是水漫金山，不过由于巨浪袭击，桅杆落了水，船不久倒吃力地浮出了海面，在暴风雨中晃动了一阵子后，最终稳住了。 ","The extreme fury of the blast proved, in a great measure, the salvation of the ship.Although completely water-logged, yet, as her masts had gone by the board, she rose, after a minute, heavily from the sea, and, staggering awhile beneath the immense pressure of the tempest, finally righted."
"我居然逃脱了灾难，说不出这是怎样的奇迹。我先是被巨浪打晕，醒来后发现自己困在船尾柱和方向舵之间了。我勉强站了起来，头晕眼花地四下张望了一番，首先想到的是我们竟曾身处如此惊涛骇浪中，还曾被卷入了一个排山倒海的漩涡，其恐怖程度远超乎想象。片刻之后，我听到一个瑞典老头的声音，他是在我们离港之时上的船。我用尽力气向他呼喊，不一会儿他蹒跚着向船尾走来。很快，我们发现我们是此次事故仅有的幸存者。除了我们，甲板上的一切都被冲走了——船长和船员们应该是在睡梦中无声无息地去了，因为船舱已经被水淹没。没有援助，我们也不指望能做什么让船只安全些，而且心里总在担心船随时都可能下沉，我们从一开始就气馁了。当然，我们的锚绳在第一阵飓风的肆虐中便像包装绳一样被扯断了，否则这船定是早早地被骤然掀翻了。我们在海上以可怕的速度向前移动着，海浪则飞过甲板击打着我们。船尾的骨架已是支离破碎，而且船身上到处都遭到损坏，已是百孔千疮。不过让我们狂喜的是，水泵没有阻塞，压舱物也没有太大的移动。暴风狂刮过后，我们认为余风应该不会再有什么危险了，但依旧对风浪的彻底平息不抱什么希望，甚至坚信稍后的巨浪定会置筋疲力尽的我们于死地。不过如此合理的预料似乎并不会马上应验。整整五天五夜——在此期间我们仅靠少量的椰子糖充饥，那是我们艰难地从水手舱里弄到的——这条废船都在狂风的推动下以难以估量的速度极速漂流着。狂风不及第一阵西蒙风猛烈，却依旧比我所经历过的任何暴风雨都要恐怖。当然，前四天中我们的航向基本没变，只是向着东南偏南方向移动，而且应该是沿着新荷兰海岸漂移。到了第五天，虽然风向逐渐北偏，但天气却愈发寒冷了。太阳带着病态的昏黄色稍稍爬出地平线，连丝光线也散发不出。天上没什么云彩，但风力却在渐长，断断续续地猛刮着。约是午后时分——这是可以估摸到的最接近的时间——我们再次被太阳所吸引。它散发出的不是真正意义上的光，而是阴沉的、没有反射的光晕，仿佛所有的光线都被偏振了。在沉入汹涌的大海的前一刻，那团光晕中央的光芒忽然消失了，似乎是被某种未知的力量匆匆熄灭。在急冲进深不见底的海洋之时，仅剩了一个昏暗的鱼片状的轮廓。","By what miracle I escaped destruction, it is impossible to say.Stunned by the shock of the water, I found myself, upon recovery, jammed in between the stern-post and rudder.With great difficulty I gained my feet, and looking dizzily around, was, at first, struck with the idea of our being among breakers; so terrific, beyond the wildest imagination, was the whirlpool of mountainous and foaming ocean within which we were engulfed.After a while, I heard the voice of an old Swede, who had shipped with us at the moment of our leaving port.I hallooed to him with all my strength, and presently he came reeling aft.We soon discovered that we were the sole survivors of the accident.All on deck, with the exception of ourselves, had been swept overboard;—the captain and mates must have perished as they slept, for the cabins were deluged with water.Without assistance, we could expect to do little for the security of the ship, and our exertions were at first paralyzed by the momentary expectation of going down.Our cable had, of course, parted like pack-thread, at the first breath of the hurricane, or we should have been instantaneously overwhelmed.We scudded with frightful velocity before the sea, and the water made clear breaches over us.The frame-work of our stern was shattered excessively, and, in almost every respect, we had received considerable injury; but to our extreme Joy we found the pumps unchoked, and that we had made no great shifting of our ballast.The main fury of the blast had already blown over, and we apprehended little danger from the violence of the wind; but we looked forward to its total cessation with dismay; well believing, that, in our shattered condition, we should inevitably perish in the tremendous swell which would ensue.But this very just apprehension seemed by no means likely to be soon verified.For five entire days and nights—during which our only subsistence was a small quantity of jaggeree, procured with great difficulty from the forecastle—the hulk flew at a rate defying computation, before rapidly succeeding flaws of wind, which, without equalling the first violence of the Simoom, were still more terrific than any tempest I had before encountered.Our course for the first four days was, with trifling variations, S.E. and by S.; and we must have run down the coast of New Holland.—On the fifth day the cold became extreme, although the wind had hauled round a point more to the northward.—The sun arose with a sickly yellow lustre, and clambered a very few degrees above the horizon—emitting no decisive light.—There were no clouds apparent, yet the wind was upon the increase, and blew with a fitful and unsteady fury.About noon, as nearly as we could guess, our attention was again arrested by the appearance of the sun.It gave out no light, properly so called, but a dull and sullen glow without reflection, as if all its rays were polarized.Just before sinking within the turgid sea, its central fires suddenly went out, as if hurriedly extinguished by some unaccountable power.It was a dim, sliver-like rim, alone, as it rushed down the unfathomable ocean."
"我们徒劳地等待第六日的到来——于我而言那一天还未到来，而于瑞典老头而言，那一天永远不会来。之后我们便陷入了斑驳的黑暗之中，看不到离船二十步以外的任何东西。无尽的黑夜继续包围着我们，没有尽头，我们在热带已经习惯了的磷火也未能把海面照亮。我们还发现，尽管暴风雨怒气未消，持续肆虐，但一直不离我们左右的惊涛骇浪却已不见。我们漂泊在如荒漠般的黑色海面上，周围一片漆黑，十分恐怖。迷信式的恐惧渐渐侵入瑞典老头的心中，我的内心亦在寂静中困惑。我们不再关心这条几近于无用的废船，只是尽可能地紧抱着后桅以图自救，痛苦地望着汪洋大海。我们无法计算时间，也无法知道身处的位置。不过，我们非常清楚，我们已经向南漂了太远，远过了所有航海家。不过没有遇上常见的冰山倒是让我们有些惊奇。当时，每时每刻都可能是我们生命的最后一刻，船下的每一个巨浪都可能将我们吞没。海浪汹涌的势头非我所能想象，但我们没有立时葬身海底，当真是个奇迹。我的同伴说着船上的货物如何之轻，提醒我船的质量如何之好。但我却不禁觉得希望已彻底消失，还沮丧地做好了死的准备。在我看来，我们与死亡相距不会超过一小时了，因为船每前行一海里，黑漆漆的大海就澎湃得愈加骇人几分，阴郁几分。有时我们地被抛向高过海上飞翔的信天翁的浪尖上，只能挣扎着喘息；有时我们又被急流甩下地狱般的深水处，眩晕不已。那里空气都是凝滞的，没有什么声响一能惊扰海妖的酣睡。 ","We waited in vain for the arrival of the sixth day—that day to me has not arrived—to the Swede, never did arrive.Thenceforward we were enshrouded in patchy darkness, so that we could not have seen an object at twenty paces from the ship.Eternal night continued to envelop us, all unrelieved by the phosphoric sea-brilliancy to which we had been accustomed in the tropics.We observed too, that, although the tempest continued to rage with unabated violence, there was no longer to be discovered the usual appearance of surf, or foam, which had hitherto attended us.All around were horror, and thick gloom, and a black sweltering desert of ebony.—Superstitious terror crept by degrees into the spirit of the old Swede, and my own soul was wrapped up in silent wonder.We neglected all care of the ship, as worse than useless, and securing ourselves, as well as possible, to the stump of the mizen-mast, looked out bitterly into the world of ocean.We had no means of calculating time, nor could we form any guess of our situation.We were, however, well aware of having made farther to the southward than any previous navigators, and felt great amazement at not meeting with the usual impediments of ice.In the meantime every moment threatened to be our last—every mountainous billow hurried to overwhelm us.The swell surpassed anything I had imagined possible, and that we were not instantly buried is a miracle.My companion spoke of the lightness of our cargo, and reminded me of the excellent qualities of our ship; but I could not help feeling the utter hopelessness of hope itself, and prepared myself gloomily for that death which I thought nothing could defer beyond an hour, as, with every knot of way the ship made, the swelling of the black stupendous seas became more dismally appalling.At times we gasped for breath at an elevation beyond the albatross—at times became dizzy with the velocity of our descent into some watery hell, where the air grew stagnant, and no sound disturbed the slumbers of the kraken."
"那时我俩身处深渊底部时＝，我的同伴忽然尖叫出声，惊惧地打破了夜的寂静。“看！","We were at the bottom of one of these abysses, when a quick scream from my companion broke fearfully upon the night.“See!"
"看！”他在我耳边尖叫了起来，“万能的主啊！看！看！”在他尖叫之际，我注意到我们所处的巨大的深渊边缘处发出一丝灰暗阴郁的红光，并不时地照射到我们的甲板上。我抬眼一看，一副景象赫然在目，顿时使我血液凝固。在我们的正上方极高的地方，一个高陡的下劈浪边缘，竟悬浮着一艘约四千吨位的巨轮。虽然它飞腾在一个比自身高出一百多倍的浪尖上，但它的目测大小超过了任何一艘第一线作战军舰或东印度大商船。船体是暗淡的深黑色，虽雕刻着轮船常见的图案，却未能淡化它的色调。一排黄铜大炮从敞开的炮门处伸出，锃亮的表面上反射着无数随着灯绳摇来晃去的战灯的火光。不过最令我们惊恐的是，它居然可以无视超自然的海洋的和无法驾驭的飓风而扬帆驶向下风。我们刚发现这船的时候，只看到了船头，那时它正从身下昏暗可怖的漩涡里缓缓地上浮。它在令人眩晕的浪尖上停留了片刻，仿佛在思忖着自己所达到的高度。这一刻极是恐怖，而后它摇摇晃晃地着冲了下来。","see!” cried he, shrieking in my ears, “Almighty God!see!see!”As he spoke, I became aware of a dull, sullen glare of red light which streamed down the sides of the vast chasm where we lay, and threw a fitful brilliancy upon our deck.Casting my eyes upwards, I beheld a spectacle which froze the current of my blood.At a terrific height directly above us, and upon the very verge of the precipitous descent, hovered a gigantic ship of, perhaps, four thousand tons.Although upreared upon the summit of a wave more than a hundred times her own altitude, her apparent size exceeded that of any ship of the line or East Indiaman in existence.Her huge hull was of a deep dingy black, unrelieved by any of the customary carvings of a ship.A single row of brass cannon protruded from her open ports, and dashed from their polished surfaces the fires of innumerable battle-lanterns, which swung to and fro about her rigging.But what mainly inspired us with horror and astonishment, was that she bore up under a press of sail in the very teeth of that supernatural sea, and of that ungovernable hurricane.When we first discovered her, her bows were alone to be seen, as she rose slowly from the dim and horrible gulf beyond her.For a moment of intense terror she paused upon the giddy pinnacle, as if in contemplation of her own sublimity, then trembled and tottered, and—came down."
"此时，不知为何我忽然变得沉着了起来。我尽力朝船尾蹒跚地走着，无畏地等待着倾覆的毁灭。我们自己的船最终不再挣扎，船头沉入了海中。接着，下落的巨轮猛撞上了已沉入水里的船头。这结果是不可避免的：我被一股势不可挡的巨力猛地抛到了那艘陌生巨轮的索具上。 ","At this instant, I know not what sudden self-possession came over my spirit.Staggering as far aft as I could, I awaited fearlessly the ruin that was to overwhelm.Our own vessel was at length ceasing from her struggles, and sinking with her head to the sea.The shock of the descending mass struck her, consequently, in that portion of her frame which was already under water, and the inevitable result was to hurl me, with irresistible violence, upon the rigging of the stranger."
"我落到船上时，大船正在戗风调向，接着便朝上风而行。幸得此时一片混乱，我才没被船员们发现。我没费什么力气便神不知鬼不觉地溜到了主舱口，见舱门半掩着，很快便找了个机会躲进了船舱。我自己也说不清为什么要这样做。第一眼看到船上的船员，便有一种莫名的恐惧感袭上我的心头，也许这就是我藏匿起来的原因。我仅是粗略的瞥了一眼人，便觉得这群人隐约有些怪异、可疑、令人生畏，我可不愿意将自己的命运托付给他们。因此，我觉得最好还是在船舱中找个地方藏身。我移开了若干隔舱板，就这样给自己在巨大的船骨之间搭了一个方便藏身的地方。 ","As I fell, the ship hove in stays, and went about; and to the confusion ensuing I attributed my escape from the notice of the crew.With little difficulty I made my way unperceived to the main hatchway, which was partially open, and soon found an opportunity of secreting myself in the hold.Why I did so I can hardly tell.An indefinite sense of awe, which at first sight of the navigators of the ship had taken hold of my mind, was perhaps the principle of my concealment.I was unwilling to trust myself with a race of people who had offered, to the cursory glance I had taken, so many points of vague novelty, doubt, and apprehension.I therefore thought proper to contrive a hiding-place in the hold.This I did by removing a small portion of the shifting-boards, in such a manner as to afford me a convenient retreat between the huge timbers of the ship."
"我刚刚弄完，船舱内就响起了脚步声，我只好躲了进去。一个男人脚步虚弱不稳地走过我的藏身处。我瞧不见他的脸，却有机会观察到了他的大体样子。此人已年迈体弱。他的膝盖因为年老而打着颤，而他整个身子则不堪重负，巍巍颤颤。他断断续续地用我听不懂的语言低声自言自语，一边在角落里那堆样子古怪的仪器和虫蛀了的航海图中摸索找寻着。他举手投足间既有返老还童似的暴躁，又有神明般的威严。最终他上了甲板，我看不见他了。","I had scarcely completed my work, when a footstep in the hold forced me to make use of it.A man passed by my place of concealment with a feeble and unsteady gait.I could not see his face, but had an opportunity of observing his general appearance.There was about it an evidence of great age and infirmity.His knees tottered beneath a load of years, and his entire frame quivered under the burthen.He muttered to himself, in a low broken tone, some words of a language which I could not understand, and groped in a corner among a pile of singular-looking instruments, and decayed charts of navigation.His manner was a wild mixture of the peevishness of second childhood, and the solemn dignity of a God.He at length went on deck, and I saw him no more."
"我被一种莫名的感觉牢牢掌控——这种感觉不容分析，而我过去的经验也无从解释，恐怕将来也不会有答案。对于我这样头脑的人来说，考虑将来就是一种不幸。我再也不会——我知道我再也不会——对自己的一套观念的本性感到满意。不过这些观念是含糊的倒也不足为奇，因为他们的来源本就相当怪异。一种新的感觉——一种全新的存在又在我心里生了根。","A feeling, for which I have no name, has taken possession of my soul—a sensation which will admit of no analysis, to which the lessons of bygone times are inadequate, and for which I fear futurity itself will offer me no key.To a mind constituted like my own, the latter consideration is an evil.I shall never—I know that I shall never—be satisfied with regard to the nature of my conceptions.Yet it is not wonderful that these conceptions are indefinite, since they have their origin in sources so utterly novel.A new sense—a new entity is added to my soul."
"我登上这艘恐怖的船已过了很长一段时间，我想我的命运已初见端倪。一帮令人费解的人！他们全都沉浸在一种冥思苦想中，从我身旁经过居然没有注意到我。在全然看不见我的人眼前躲起来，于我而言真是够傻的。刚刚我还从他们眼前大摇大摆地走过去；不久之前我还大胆地去船长的私人船舱拿了些纸笔，就是用它们写下我的见闻的。我会一直坚持把日志写下去。我应该是没什么机会将它公诸于世，不过我还是会竭尽全力的。到最后关头，我会把手稿放在瓶子里，抛到海中。","It is long since I first trod the deck of this terrible ship, and the rays of my destiny are, I think, gathering to a focus.Incomprehensible men!Wrapped up in meditations of a kind which I cannot divine, they pass me by unnoticed.Concealment is utter folly on my part, for the people will not see.It was but just now that I passed directly before the eyes of the mate—it was no long while ago that I ventured into the captain’s own private cabin, and took thence the materials with which I write, and have written.I shall from time to time continue this Journal.It is true that I may not find an opportunity of transmitting it to the world, but I will not fail to make the endeavour.At the last moment I will enclose the MS. in a bottle, and cast it within the sea."
"一件小事的发生给了我更多新的思考空间。莫非这真的是不受控制的命运的安排？我曾冒险到甲板上去，躺在在帆船底部一堆梯绳和旧帆布中间，结果也没有人注意我。当我沉浸在在对自己奇特命运的思考中时，无意中抓着一把柏油刷涂抹着身边一只大桶上一张折得整整齐齐的辅助帆的边缘。现在那辅助帆展开在船上，我用刷子胡乱涂抹的痕迹竟是“发现”这个单词。","An incident has occurred which has given me new room for meditation.Are such things the operation of ungoverned Chance?I had ventured upon deck and thrown myself down, without attracting any notice, among a pile of ratlin-stuff and old sails in the bottom of the yawl.While musing upon the singularity of my fate, I unwittingly daubed with a tar-brush the edges of a neatly-folded studding-sail which lay near me on a barrel.The studding-sail is now bent upon the ship, and the thoughtless touches of the brush are spread out into the word DISCOVERY."
"最近我对大船的构造做了很多观察。尽管大船武装精良，但我觉得它不是一艘战船。船上的索具、船的构造和大体装备，都说明它不是。我能断言它不是什么战船，不过它到底是什么，又实在说不上来。我仔细审查了着它奇特的外形、还有独特的桅杆、巨大的体型、大得离谱的帆，以及极其简易的船头和老式的船尾，心头间或会闪过一种熟悉的感觉，并总是混杂着一些不甚清晰的记忆——对古老的异国编年史和远古时代的无法解释的追忆，我不知道为什么会这样。我一直在观察船骨。它是由一种我所不知的材料制成的。在我看来，这种木材的特质并不适合用来做船骨。我是说，在海上航行时船骨易遭虫蛀，仅是考虑到这一点，这种木头的材质也过于松软，且不说经年累月后木头本来就会腐烂。如果西班牙橡木是使用某种非自然的方法膨胀起来的话，这种木头便具备了它的一切特征——或许这种说法过于挑剔。 ","I have made many observations lately upon the structure of the vessel.Although well armed, she is not, I think, a ship of war.Her rigging, build, and general equipment, all negative a supposition of this kind.What she is not, I can easily perceive—what she is I fear it is impossible to say.I know not how it is, but in scrutinizing her strange model and singular cast of spars, her huge size and overgrown suits of canvas, her severely simple bow and antiquated stern, there will occasionally flash across my mind a sensation of familiar things, and there is always mixed up with such indistinct shadows of recollection, an unaccountable memory of old foreign chronicles and ages long ago.I have been looking at the timbers of the ship.She is built of a material to which I am a stranger.There is a peculiar character about the wood which strikes me as rendering it unfit for the purpose to which it has been applied.I mean its extreme porousness, considered independently by the worm-eaten condition which is a consequence of navigation in these seas, and apart from the rottenness attendant upon age.It will appear perhaps an observation somewhat over-curious, but this wood would have every, characteristic of Spanish oak, if Spanish oak were distended by any unnatural means."
"正读着上面这句的时候，我突然想起了一个饱经风霜的荷兰老航海家的古怪格言。每当有人对他的诚实心存质疑时，他便会说：“这就和船在海水中泡着就会像水手的身体一样被泡得很大是一样的，都是千真万确的。 ","In reading the above sentence a curious apothegm of an old weather-beaten Dutch navigator comes full upon my recollection.“It is as sure,” he was wont to say, when any doubt was entertained of his veracity, “as sure as there is a sea where the ship itself will grow in bulk like the living body of the seaman.”"
"约摸一个小时前，我大着胆子闯进一伙船员中间。虽然我就站在他们正中间，但他们对我毫不理睬，像是根本没意识到我的存在一样。就像我刚开始在船舱里看到的那人一样，他们全都老态龙钟。他们的膝盖因虚弱而颤抖；肩背因衰老而驼得厉害；枯皱的皮肤在风中嘎嘎作响；眼睛里闪烁着年老浑浊的光芒；灰白的头发在暴风中恐怖地飘动着。在他们周围，甲板上到处散落着稀奇古怪、式样过时的数学仪器。 ","About an hour ago, I made bold to thrust myself among a group of the crew.They paid me no manner of attention, and, although I stood in the very midst of them all, seemed utterly unconscious of my presence.Like the one I had at first seen in the hold, they all bore about them the marks of a hoary old age.Their knees trembled with infirmity; their shoulders were bent double with decrepitude; their shrivelled skins rattled in the wind; their voices were low, tremulous and broken; their eyes glistened with the rheum of years; and their gray hairs streamed terribly in the tempest.Around them, on every part of the deck, lay scattered mathematical instruments of the most quaint and obsolete construction."
"我前面提到过辅助帆已经张开了。从那时候起，船便一直顺着狂风继续着恐怖的南行之旅。从桅杆顶端的木冠到帆的下桁，整个船帆在船上迎风鼓起。每时每刻，桁端都会卷进骇人的巨浪之中，海水之恐怖程度，非人所能想象。我发现尽管对船员们来说在甲板上并没什么不便，但于我而言，却是无法立足于此。这艘大船居然没有立时被巨浪所吞没，在我看来当真是奇迹中的奇迹。我们一定是注定了要永远徘徊在永恒的边缘而无法最终一跃入海。船如海鸥一般，箭一样地在我前所未见的惊涛骇浪中滑行。那巨浪抬着头，如同地狱的恶魔一般，却又只限于恐吓，而不会当真毁灭什么。我只能把屡次的侥幸归因为自然因素，因为唯有自然才有此等力量——我只能推测，船是遇到了某种强大的水流或海底逆流。 ","I mentioned some time ago the bending of a studding-sail.From that period the ship, being thrown dead off the wind, has continued her terrific course due south, with every rag of canvas packed upon her, from her trucks to her lower studding-sail booms, and rolling every moment her top-gallant yard-arms into the most appalling hell of water which it can enter into the mind of a man to imagine.I have just left the deck, where I find it impossible to maintain a footing, although the crew seem to experience little inconvenience.It appears to me a miracle of miracles that our enormous bulk is not swallowed up at once and forever.We are surely doomed to hover continually upon the brink of Eternity, without taking a final plunge into the abyss.From billows a thousand times more stupendous than any I have ever seen, we glide away with the facility of the arrowy sea-gull; and the colossal waters rear their heads above us like demons of the deep, but like demons confined to simple threats and forbidden to destroy.I am led to attribute these frequent escapes to the only natural cause which can account for such effect.—I must suppose the ship to be within the influence of some strong current, or impetuous under-tow."
"我曾与船长在他的船舱里面对面地碰见过，但如我所料，他对我视而不见。不经意地一看，他的外表与常人无别，但我凝视他时，心里还是生出了无法抑制的敬畏，以及好奇的感觉。他大概和我差不多高——五英尺八英寸左右。他体格结实紧致，既不粗壮也不十分纤细。但他脸上的表情很是奇异——年老的痕迹是如此明显、触目惊心而又令人毛骨悚然，老得彻底，老得无以复加。这样的脸在我心中激起了一种说不清道不明的感觉。他的前额上尽管没什么皱纹，却像是带着了岁月的印记——他灰白的头发记录着过去，苍白的眼珠预示着未来。船舱的地板上堆积着厚厚一地的奇怪的铁扣对开本书籍、残破的科学仪器以及遭弃很久的过时航海图。他双手捧着低垂的脑袋，凝视着一张纸，眼神炯炯而不安。那纸我看应是一张委任状，上面竟有国王的签名。他低声自言自语着，就像我在船舱里见到的第一个船员那样。他怒冲冲地低声说了几句外国话。尽管他就在我的身旁，但那声音却像从一英里以外传来的一样。","I have seen the captain face to face, and in his own cabin—but, as I expected, he paid me no attention.Although in his appearance there is, to a casual observer, nothing which might bespeak him more or less than man-still a feeling of irrepressible reverence and awe mingled with the sensation of wonder with which I regarded him.In stature he is nearly my own height; that is, about five feet eight inches.He is of a well-knit and compact frame of body, neither robust nor remarkably otherwise.But it is the singularity of the expression which reigns upon the face—it is the intense, the wonderful, the thrilling evidence of old age, so utter, so extreme, which excites within my spirit a sense—a sentiment ineffable.His forehead, although little wrinkled, seems to bear upon it the stamp of a myriad of years.—His gray hairs are records of the past, and his grayer eyes are Sybils of the future.The cabin floor was thickly strewn with strange, iron-clasped folios, and mouldering instruments of science, and obsolete long-forgotten charts.His head was bowed down upon his hands, and he pored, with a fiery unquiet eye, over a paper which I took to be a commission, and which, at all events, bore the signature of a monarch.He muttered to himself, as did the first seaman whom I saw in the hold, some low peevish syllables of a foreign tongue, and although the speaker was close at my elbow, his voice seemed to reach my ears from the distance of a mile."
"这艘船以及船上的一切都散发出一种远古的气息。船员像埋葬了千百年的幽灵般来回飘动，他们的眼神焦灼不安。当他们的指尖在耀眼的战灯光亮下扫过我面前时，我都会生出一种前所未有的感觉，尽管在我的灵魂幻灭之前，一生都在与古物打交道，心中早已投下了巴尔贝克、泰德穆尔、波斯波利斯那倾覆支柱之影。 ","The ship and all in it are imbued with the spirit of Eld.The crew glide to and fro like the ghosts of buried centuries; their eyes have an eager and uneasy meaning; and when their fingers fall athwart my path in the wild glare of the battle-lanterns, I feel as I have never felt before, although I have been all my life a dealer in antiquities, and have imbibed the shadows of fallen columns at Balbec, and Tadmor, and Persepolis, until my very soul has become a ruin."
"我四下看了看，不禁为自己先前的担忧而惭愧。要是看到一直不离左右的狂风就吓得发抖，那看到狂风与海洋之战，还不得吓得呆若木鸡？须知若将此战与龙卷风跟西蒙风相比，后二者是根本不值一提的。船的附近唯有无穷无尽的夜的黑，还有无沫海水的喧嚣，但是在船两侧各一里格远的地方，巨大的冰墙间或隐约可见。它们高耸直入苍凉的天空，看上去就像是宇宙之墙。 ","When I look around me I feel ashamed of my former apprehensions.If I trembled at the blast which has hitherto attended us, shall I not stand aghast at a warring of wind and ocean, to convey any idea of which the words tornado and simoom are trivial and ineffective?All in the immediate vicinity of the ship is the blackness of eternal night, and a chaos of foamless water; but, about a league on either side of us, may be seen, indistinctly and at intervals, stupendous ramparts of ice, towering away into the desolate sky, and looking like the walls of the universe."
"如我所想，这船确实是在水流中前行，若这潮水可称为水流的话。这潮水正在白冰之中怒吼尖叫，如洪水般迅猛地向南奔流而去。","As I imagined, the ship proves to be in a current; if that appellation can properly be given to a tide which, howling and shrieking by the white ice, thunders on to the southward with a velocity like the headlong dashing of a cataract."
"我想我心底的恐惧根本无法形容，不过我决心要探清这个恐怖地带的秘密。这种好奇心战胜了绝望，也使我不惮于那最是可怕的死亡。很显然，我们坐着这船，正匆匆奔着某些激动人心的秘密而去——某些永远无人知晓的秘密，而其结局必然是毁灭。也许水流便是带着我们去到南极的。须得承认，这个猜测虽貌似荒诞，却也是极有可能的。","To conceive the horror of my sensations is, I presume, utterly impossible; yet a curiosity to penetrate the mysteries of these awful regions, predominates even over my despair, and will reconcile me to the most hideous aspect of death.It is evident that we are hurrying onwards to some exciting knowledge—some never-to-be-imparted secret, whose attainment is destruction.Perhaps this current leads us to the southern pole itself.It must be confessed that a supposition apparently so wild has every probability in its favor."
"船员们在甲板上踱来踱去，步子颤抖不安，不过，他们脸上的表情更多的是希望的渴求，而不是绝望的漠然。 ","The crew pace the deck with unquiet and tremulous step; but there is upon their countenances an expression more of the eagerness of hope than of the apathy of despair."
"与此同时，船尾依然被风吹着，由于船帆林立，船时不时会被整个抛离海面——哦，那真是险象环生！那冰忽然向右裂开，接着又向左裂开，我们则头晕目眩地绕着巨大的同心圆打转，一圈又一圈地绕着一个巨大的冰斗转着，而它的冰墙的墙头却远远地消失在黑暗之中。我还没来得及想自己的命运，船绕的圈子迅速地变小了，我们陷在漩涡里，猛地栽了进去。船在海洋和暴风雨雷鸣般的怒吼咆哮声中剧烈颤动，哦，天哪！而且它在下沉。","In the meantime the wind is still in our poop, and, as we carry a crowd of canvas, the ship is at times lifted bodily from out the sea—Oh, horror upon horror!the ice opens suddenly to the right, and to the left, and we are whirling dizzily, in immense concentric circles, round and round the borders of a gigantic amphitheatre, the summit of whose walls is lost in the darkness and the distance.But little time will be left me to ponder upon my destiny—the circles rapidly grow small—we are plunging madly within the grasp of the whirlpool—and amid a roaring, and bellowing, and thundering of ocean and of tempest, the ship is quivering, oh God! and—going down."
"注：《瓶中手稿》最初发表于1831年。直到多年以后，我才对墨卡托画的地图有所了解。地图上表明了海洋从四个入口流入北极湾，然后被地球吸进腹部。北极的标志是高耸入云的黑色巨石。","NOTE.—The “MS. Found in a Bottle,” was originally published in 1831 (1833), and it was not until many years afterwards that I became acquainted with the maps of Mercator, in which the ocean is represented as rushing, by four mouths, into the (northern) Polar Gulf, to be absorbed into the bowels of the earth; the Pole itself being represented by a black rock, towering to a prodigious height."
