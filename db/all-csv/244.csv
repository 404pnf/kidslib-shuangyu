"两只蓝鸟","Two Blue Birds"
"作者：D. H. 劳伦斯 ","by D. H. Lawrence"
"有一个女人，爱着他的丈夫，却不能和他生活在一起。丈夫这方呢，虽也真心依恋着妻子，但也无法跟她共同生活。他们都还不到四十岁，都是相貌俊俏，魅力十足。两人相敬如宾，而且说来也怪，他们都觉得彼此能够相守一生。他们对彼此的了解比对其他任何人的了解都要深，同时他们也觉得没有比对方更了解自己的人了。","There was a woman who loved her husband, but she could not live with him.The husband, on his side, was sincerely attached to his wife, yet he could not live with her.They were both under forty, both handsome and both attractive.They had the most sincere regard for one another, and felt, in some odd way, eternally married to one another.They knew one another more intimately than they knew anybody else, they felt more known to one another than to any other person."
"然而他们却无法生活在一起。通常，在地域上，他们总是远隔千里。他坐在英格兰的蒙蒙灰雾中，一心忠诚不移，可他知道自己的妻子此时正在南方的阳光下做着风流事，尽管她还奇怪地向往着要做个忠贞的女人。而她，正坐在海面上方的露台上品着鸡尾酒，转过她灰色的眼眸嘲讽地看着她的追求者那又大又黑的脸，她确实挺喜欢他的。但实际上她满脑子都是年轻英俊的丈夫那张轮廓分明的脸庞，想着他如何用他那温和而充满自信的声音要求他的女秘书为他做事——他清楚地知道自己的要求肯定会被愉快地满足。","Yet they could not live together.Usually, they kept a thousand miles apart, geographically.But when he sat in the greyness of England, at the back of his mind, with a certain grim fidelity, he was aware of his wife, her strange yearning to be loyal and faithful, having her gallant affairs away in the sun, in the south.And she, as she drank her cocktail on the terrace over the sea, and turned her grey, sardonic eyes on the heavy dark face of her admirer, whom she really liked quite a lot, she was actually preoccupied with the clear-cut features of her handsome young husband, thinking of how he would be asking his secretary to do something for him, asking in that good-natured, confident voice of a man who knows that his request will be only too gladly fulfilled."
"那女秘书，当然是仰慕他的。她不仅年轻漂亮，而且非常能干。她仰慕他。但他所有的佣人都仰慕他，特别是他的女佣人。他的男佣人却可能会欺骗他。","The secretary, of course, adored him.She was very competent, quite young, and quite good-looking.She adored him.But then all his servants always did, particularly his women-servants.His men-servants were likely to swindle him."
"当一个男人有个仰慕他的女秘书，而你就是这个人的妻子，你会怎么办？这倒不是说他们之间有什么不对劲的地方——如果你明白我的意思。实际上，绝对没有你可以称之为苟且的事。绝对没有！他们只是年轻的雇主和秘书的关系而已。雇主向秘书发号施令，秘书对其唯命是从并仰慕着雇主，整件事就是这么回事了。","When a man has an adoring secretary, and you are the man’s wife, what are you to do?Not that there was anything ‘wrong’—if you know what I mean!—between them.Nothing you could call adultery, to come down to brass tacks.No, no!They were just the young master and his secretary.He dictated to her, she slaved for him and adored him, and the whole thing went on wheels."
"而他并不“仰慕”她。一个男人没必要去仰慕自己的女秘书。但他却依赖她。“我只是依赖威克斯奥小姐而已！”然而他绝不可能依赖他的妻子。因为，他最终明白了她的一件事，那就是她并不打算被人依赖。","He didn’t ‘adore’ her.A man doesn’t need to adore his secretary.But he depended on her.“I simply rely on Miss Wrexall.”Whereas he could never rely on his wife.The one thing he knew finally about her was that she didn’t intend to be relied on."
"所以他们虽有着夫妻之间不言而喻的极度亲密，却一直保持着朋友一样的关系。他们每年都会一起出去度假，如果他们未结连理，他们肯定会在彼此身上发现更多的乐趣与刺激。可是他们结了婚，结婚已经十二年了，而且在近三四年内又无法生活在一起，这个事实不禁破坏了彼此的兴致。夫妻俩心里都对对方起了怨恨。","So they remained friends, in the awful unspoken intimacy of the once-married.Usually each year they went away together for a holiday, and, if they had not been man and wife, they would have found a great deal of fun and stimulation in one another.The fact that they were married, had been married for the last dozen years, and couldn’t live together for the last three or four, spoilt them for one another.Each had a private feeling of bitterness about the other."
"尽管如此，他们都是十分友善的人。他心胸宽广，无论她做了多少对他不忠的事，他都一直对她温柔体贴、敬重有加。风流韵事不过是她时髦生活中不可缺少的一部分。“毕竟，我还要生活呀。我不能仅仅因为我们不能生活在一起，就得在五分钟内变成一根盐柱子吧！要我这样的女人变成盐柱得花上好几年呢！至少我希望如此！”","However, they were awfully kind.He was the soul of generosity, and held her in real tender esteem, no matter how many gallant affairs she had.Her gallant affairs were part of her modern necessity.“After all, I’ve got to live.I can’t turn into a pillar of salt in five minutes just because you and I can’t live together!It takes years for a woman like me to turn into a pillar of salt.At least I hope so!”"
"“确实如此！”他回应道，“确实！在你结晶前，先想尽办法把那些个男人放进盐水里变成腌黄瓜再说。那就是我的建议。”","“Quite!” he replied.“Quite!By all means put them in pickle, make pickled cucumbers of them, before you crystallise out.That’s my advice.”"
"他就是这样：如此聪颖又高深莫测。腌黄瓜的意思她或多或少能理解，但是“结晶”是什么意思呢？","He was like that: so awfully clever and enigmatic.She could more or less fathom the idea of the pickled cucumbers, but the ‘crystallising out’—what did that signify?"
"难道他意在暗示他自己已经腌够了，再腌下去不但没有必要，还会毁了他的风味吗？他是这个意思吗？而她，就是那盐水和泪溪吗？","And did he mean to suggest that he himself had been well pickled and that further immersion was for him unnecessary, would spoil his flavour?Was that what he meant?And herself, was she the brine and the vale of tears?"
"你永远都琢磨不透一个男人有多狡猾，如果他既聪明又高深，而且还有点古怪。他古怪得有些可爱，上唇较长，嘴角灵活而傲气十足地一撇，显得好不神气！然而，像他这样一个轮廓分明，如演员般俊俏的年轻男人，又怎么会不骄傲呢？这都是女人造成的。","You never knew how catty a man was being, when he was really clever and enigmatic, withal a bit whimsical.He was adorably whimsical, with a twist of his flexible, vain mouth, that had a long upper lip, so fraught with vanity!But then a handsome, clear-cut, histrionic young man like that, how could he help being vain?The women made him so."
"啊！女人！如果没有其他女人，男人们该多好啊！","Ah, the women!How nice men would be if there were no other women!"
"同样，如果没有其他男人，女人们该多好啊！这就是女秘书的最大好处。她可能有丈夫，但是与老板、主人——一个对你发号施令、他说的每个字你都必须忠实记录、誊写的男人——相比起来，丈夫是多么地微不足道啊。试想哪位妻子会记录下她丈夫说的每一句话!但女秘书会！她会记录下老板说的每一个“而且”和“但是”。相比之下，蜜糖紫罗兰算什么！","And how nice the women would be if there were no other men!That’s the best of a secretary.She may have a husband, but a husband is the mere shred of a man, compared to a boss, a chief, a man who dictates to you and whose words you faithfully write down and then transcribe.Imagine a wife writing down anything her husband said to her!But a secretary!Every and and but of his she preserves for ever.What are candied violets in comparison!"
"在遥远的北方，那个你应该视之为家的地方，亲爱的丈夫正在对他的女秘书发号施令。一想到这些，你就会觉得当下在这南方明媚的阳光下干些风流事也不为过。对于女秘书，你从不屑于去恨她，只是相当鄙视罢了，尽管你承认女秘书有她的诸多优点。当然，眼里有了这么一粒沙子，风流韵事就不再那么快活了。或许你心底深处还惦记着什么。","Now it is all very well having gallant affairs under the southern sun, when you know there is a husband whom you adore dictating to a secretary whom you are too scornful to hate yet whom you rather despise, though you allow she has her good points, away north in the place you ought to regard as home.A gallant affair isn’t much good when you’ve got a bit of grit in your eye.Or something at the back of your mind."
"该怎么办呢？当然，当初并不是丈夫把妻子打发走的。","What’s to be done?The husband, of course, did not send his wife away."
"“你有了秘书和工作，”她说，“哪里还有我的位置？”","“You’ve got your secretary and your work,” she said.“There’s no room for me.”"
"“你有你专用的卧室和客厅啊。”他回答道，“还有个花园和一辆两人合用的汽车。一切都随你便。干什么都行，只要你高兴。”","“There’s a bedroom and a sitting-room exclusively for you,” he replied.“And a garden and half a motor-car.But please yourself entirely.Do what gives you most pleasure.”"
"“那样的话，”她说，“我去南方过冬好了。”","“In that case,” she said, “I’ll just go south for the winter.”"
"“行，去吧！”他说道，“你一直喜欢南方。”","“Yes, do!” he said.“You always enjoy it.”"
"“是啊。”她应道。","“I always do,” she replied."
"他们无情的分离背后却有一丝淡淡的惆怅。她走了，去干她的风流事去了，但这种生活也是苦乐参半的。而他则专注工作。他说他讨厌工作，但他从没做过别的事情。一天工作十或十一个小时。这就是自己做老板的代价。","They parted with a certain relentlessness that had a touch of wistful sentiment behind it.Off she went to her gallant affairs, that were like the curate’s egg, palatable in parts.And he settled down to work.He said he hated working, but he never did anything else.Ten or eleven hours a day.That’s what it is to be your own master!"
"冬天慢慢消逝，春天来了，这种情况下，燕子也北飞归巢了。这个冬天，与往年冬天一样，真是特别难熬。这位风流太太越是眨眼，眼中的那粒沙子就陷得越深。忧郁的脸也许看上去很阴沉，加冰的鸡尾酒或许能给脸上添丝红润；她使劲地眨着眼想把这沙子挤走，却是枉然。坐在含羞草馥郁的圆形花朵下，她想着她的丈夫现在应该正在他的书房里，而他那位整洁、能干但却有些普通的小秘书永远都在记录他的每句话！","So the winter wore away, and it was spring, when the swallows homeward fly, or northward, in this case.This winter, one of a series similar, had been rather hard to get through.The bit of grit in the gallant lady’s eye had worked deeper in the more she blinked.Dark faces might be dark, and icy cocktails might lend a glow; she blinked her hardest to blink that bit of grit away, without success.Under the spicy balls of the mimosa she thought of that husband of hers in his library, and of that neat, competent but common little secretary of his, for ever taking down what he said!"
"“一个人怎能受得了这个！我真不明白，像她这样一个普通的小女人，怎么能受得了这个！”妻子冲自己喊道。","“How a man can stand it!How she can stand it, common little thing as she is, I don’t know!” the wife cried to herself."
"她指的是这种听写的工作，一天十个小时的交流，两人之间除了一只铅笔和滔滔不绝的话语，别无其他。","She meant this dictating business, this ten hours a day intercourse, à deux, with nothing but a pencil between them, and a flow of words."
"该怎么办呢？事情不但没起色，反而愈来愈糟。小秘书还把她妈妈和妹妹都带到家里来了。她妈妈成了厨师和管家，妹妹则做了高级女佣——她很会洗烫衣服，专门负责收拾整理他的服装，把他收拾得体体面面。这真是个绝佳的安排啊！她老妈是个出色的家庭厨师，妹妹则将贴心的侍女、能干的洗衣工、高级客厅女佣、餐厅侍应集于一身！这倒挺划算。她们对他的事务非常用心。当他的某个债权人来要账时，他的女秘书就会飞一般地赶到城里，并总能顺利地化解财务危机。","What was to be done?Matters, instead of improving, had grown worse.The little secretary had brought her mother and sister into the establishment.The mother was a sort of cook-housekeeper, the sister was a sort of upper maid—she did the fine laundry, and looked after ‘his’ clothes, and valeted him beautifully.It was really an excellent arrangement.The old mother was a splendid plain cook, the sister was all that could be desired as a valet de chambre, a fine laundress, an upper parlour-maid, and a table-waiter.And all economical to a degree.They knew his affairs by heart.His secretary flew to town when a creditor became dangerous, and she always smoothed over the financial crisis."
"“他”，当然有债务，他工作就是要偿还债务。如果他是童话中的王子，能召集蚂蚁来帮忙，也不可能有比得到这家人的帮助更奇妙的事了。她们几乎不要工钱。她们似乎每天都在上演着无视私人利益的奇迹。","‘He’, of course, had debts, and he was working to pay them off.And if he had been a fairy prince who could call the ants to help him, he would not have been more wonderful than in securing this secretary and her family.They took hardly any wages.And they seemed to perform the miracle of loaves and fishes daily."
"“她”，当然是个爱丈夫的妻子，不过她让他负债，她的开销一直都很大。然而，当她出现在她“家”时，仍受到了秘书一家无比殷勤的款待和尊重。东征回来的十字军都没造成这么大的轰动。她感觉自己像是伊丽莎白女王驾临凯尼尔沃思，俨然一国之君在访问其忠诚的子民。但是，也许她的汤里总藏着一根头发。难道她们不想我再次离开吗？","‘She’, of course, was the wife who loved her husband, but helped him into debt, and she still was an expensive item.Yet when she appeared at her ‘home’, the secretarial family received her with most elaborate attentions and deference.The knight returning from the Crusades didn’t create a greater stir.She felt like Queen Elizabeth at Kenilworth, a sovereign paying a visit to her faithful subjects.But perhaps there lurked always this hair in her soup!Won’t they be glad to be rid of me again!"
"但是她们抗议说，不！不！她们一直翘首期盼，祈祷着她能回来。她们一直渴望着她——家里的女主人，“他”的妻子——回来掌管这个家。啊，“他”的妻子！","But they protested No!No!They had been waiting and hoping and praying she would come.They had been pining for her to be there, in charge: the mistress, ‘his’ wife.Ah, ‘his’ wife!"
"“他”的妻子！他的光环有如一只水桶，悬在她的头顶上。","‘His’ wife!His halo was like a bucket over her head."
"厨子妈妈登不上台面，所以是高级女佣女儿来听候差遣。","The cook-mother was ‘of the people’, so it was the upper-maid daughter who came for orders."
"“吉太太，您对明天的中餐和晚餐有什么指示？”","“What will you order for to-morrow’s lunch and dinner, Mrs. Gee?”"
"“你们平常都吃些什么呢？”","“Well, what do you usually have?”"
"“哦，我们想要您来定夺。”","“Oh, we want you to say.”"
"“不不，你们平常都吃些什么呢？”","“No, what do you usually have?”"
"“我们没有什么固定的。妈妈每天出去买菜，总是选她能碰见最好的——最新鲜的菜。但她想您现在可以告诉她应该买些什么。”","“We don’t have anything fixed.Mother goes out and chooses the best she can find, that is nice and fresh.But she thought you would tell her now what to get.”"
"“哦，我真不知道！我对那些事情不太在行。叫她跟平时一样买吧；我想她肯定知道怎么做最好。”","“Oh, I don’t know!I’m not very good at that sort of thing.Ask her to go on just the same; I’m quite sure she knows best.”"
"“或许您会想来点甜食？”","“Perhaps you’d like to suggest a sweet?”"
"“不，我不喜欢甜食，你知道吉先生也不喜欢甜食。所以不用为我做了。”","“No, I don’t care for sweets—and you know Mr. Gee doesn’t.So don’t make one for me.”"
"还能有什么事比这更不可思议！她们把房子打扫得一尘不染，把家管理得如同梦境；当看到她们如此惊人地精打细算，她这样一个不称职的骄奢妻子又怎敢贸然干涉呢？但她们却是两手空空地持家！","Could anything be more impossible!They had the house spotless and running like a dream; how could an incompetent and extravagant wife dare to interfere, when she saw their amazing and almost inspired economy!But they ran the place on simply nothing!"
"这些神奇的人！她们在她脚下撒棕榈枝，对她毕恭毕敬。","Simply marvellous people!And the way they strewed palm branches under her feet!"
"但是那只会让她觉得自己更可笑。","But that only made her feel ridiculous."
"“你不认为家里打点得很好吗？”他试探着问她。","“Don’t you think the family manage very well?” he asked her tentatively."
"“棒极了！几乎好得超乎想象！”她回答说。“但我想你应该很幸福吧？”","“Awfully well!Almost romantically well!” she replied.“But I suppose you’re perfectly happy?”"
"“我觉得非常舒服！”他答道。","“I’m perfectly comfortable,” he replied."
"“我看得出来，”她说，“真是舒服得不可思议！我从不知道会有这么舒服！你确定这对你没坏处吗？”","“I can see you are,” she replied.“Amazingly so!I never knew such comfort!Are you sure it isn’t bad for you?”"
"她偷偷看了他一眼。他看起来气色很好，非常英俊，派头十足。他衣着考究、干净利落。他有着从容淡定的神态、高度的幽默感，这对一个男人来说，是再适宜不过的风度了。也只有当他像一只被家里的母鸡们好生伺候的公鸡时，才会拥有如此风度。","She eyed him stealthily.He looked very well, and extremely handsome, in his histrionic way.He was shockingly well-dressed and valeted.And he had that air of easy aplomb and good humour which is so becoming to a man, and which he only acquires when he is cock of his own little walk, made much of by his own hens."
"“不！”他说着，从嘴里取下烟斗，对着她古怪地笑着。“这看起来像是对我有坏处么？”","“No!” he said, taking his pipe from his mouth and smiling whimsically round at her.“Do I look as if it were bad for me?”"
"“不，不是。”她立即回答道，如女人这会儿该想的一样，心里很自然地想到了他的健康和舒适——显然，这些才是一切幸福的基础。","“No, you don’t,” she replied promptly: thinking, naturally, as a woman is supposed to think nowadays, of his health and comfort, the foundation, apparently, of all happiness."
"然后，当然，趁他还没有回答，她马上把话题岔开了。","Then, of course, away she went on the back-wash."
"“但也许对你的工作有影响，不像对你个人而言那么好。”她小声地说道。她知道，他受不了她对他的工作哪怕一丁点的嘲笑。而他却明白她的这种轻声细语。","“Perhaps for your work, though, it’s not so good as it is for you,” she said in a rather small voice.She knew he couldn’t bear it if she mocked at his work for one moment.And he knew that rather small voice of hers."
"“怎么说？”他说道，头发都竖了起来。","“In what way?” he said, bristles rising."
"“哦，我也不知道，”她冷淡地答道，“一个男人要是太舒适的话，对他的事业可能不太好吧。”","“Oh, I don’t know,” she answered indifferently.“Perhaps it’s not good for a man’s work if he is too comfortable.”"
"“我怎么就不知道呢！”他说道，抽着烟斗，在书房里夸张地转来转去。“按我每天实际工作十二个小时，短的时候十个小时来算，我认为你不能说我因为舒服而堕落了。”","“I don’t know about that!” he said, taking a dramatic turn round the library and drawing at his pipe.“Considering I work, actually, by the clock, for twelve hours a day, and for ten hours when it’s a short day, I don’t think you can say I am deteriorating from easy comfort.”"
"“不是，我想不会。”她承认。","“No, I suppose not,” she admitted."
"但是，她的确是这么想的。他的舒服并不在于吃好睡好，而在于没任何人和任何事来违逆他。女秘书曾跟她说过：“我确实认为他没有什么可恼的事情。”","Yet she did think it, nevertheless.His comfortableness didn’t consist so much in good food and a soft bed, as in having nobody, absolutely nobody and nothing to contradict him.“I do like to think he’s got nothing to aggravate him,” the secretary had said to the wife."
"“没有可恼的事情！”对男人来说这是多么舒服的状态啊！被女人照料着，没什么事让他“可恼”的。如果真有什么事能刺激到他那受伤的虚荣心，那就是这件事了。","“Nothing to aggravate him!”What a position for a man!Fostered by women who would let nothing ‘aggravate’ him.If anything would aggravate his wounded vanity, this would!"
"妻子是这么认为的。但她又能样呢？寂静的午夜，她听到远处他口述的声音，然后渐渐远去，如同上帝对塞缪尔说话时的声音，孤单且单调。她能想象到女秘书正忙着速记的小小身影。在旭日初升的早上，他还没起床——他从未在中午之前起过床——而另一个方向却传来了如虫鸣般的刺耳打字声，就像只大蚱蜢在叽喳鸣叫。那是女秘书在用打字机敲打他的讲话记录，可怜的小东西。","So thought the wife.But what was to be done about it?In the silence of midnight she heard his voice in the distance, dictating away, like the voice of God to Samuel, alone and monotonous, and she imagined the little figure of the secretary busily scribbling shorthand.Then in the sunny hours of morning, while he was still in bed—he never rose till noon—from another distance came that sharp insect noise of the typewriter, like some immense grasshopper chirping and rattling.It was the secretary, poor thing, typing out his notes."
"那个姑娘——才二十八岁——工作太卖命了，都瘦成了皮包骨头。她娇小灵巧，但她实在是累坏了。她做的事比他做的要多得多，因为她不仅要记下所有他说的话，还要趁他还在休息的时候用打字机打出来，并制作三个副本。","That girl—she was only twenty-eight—really slaved herself to skin and bone.She was small and neat, but she was actually worn out.She did far more work than he did, for she had not only to take down all those words he uttered, she had to type them out, make three copies, while he was still resting."
"“她到底从中得到了些什么？”妻子想着，“我实在不明白。她薪水很低，只累得个皮包骨，他也从未吻过她，而且他也永远不会吻她，如果我对他十分了解的话。”","“What on earth she gets out of it,” thought the wife, “I don’t know.She’s simply worn to the bone, for a very poor salary, and he’s never kissed her, and never will, if I know anything about him.”"
"他从没吻过他的女秘书——这是好还是坏，妻子也没法决断。他从不亲吻任何人。就算是她自己，作为妻子，她都不清楚他是否会吻自己。她宁愿认为是她不想要。","Whether his never kissing her—the secretary, that is—made it worse or better, the wife did not decide.He never kissed anybody.Whether she herself—the wife, that is—wanted to be kissed by him, even that she was not clear about.She rather thought she didn’t."
"那她到底想要些什么呢？她是他的妻子。她到底需要他的什么呢？","What on earth did she want then?She was his wife.What on earth did she want of him?"
"她肯定不会想去速记他说的话，并在打字机上把那些话再次打出来。而且她并不真的想他吻她，因为她太了解他了。是的，她太了解他了。如果你过于了解一个男人，你就不会想他吻你。","She certainly didn’t want to take him down in shorthand, and type out again all those words.And she didn’t really want him to kiss her; she knew him too well.Yes, she knew him too well.If you know a man too well, you don’t want him to kiss you."
"然后呢？她想要什么呢？为什么她对他还是这么地念念不忘？只是因为她是他妻子吗？她为什么如此“喜欢”与别的男人在一起——并对此乐此不疲——但却从不把他们当回事？而为什么当她不再真正“喜欢”与他在一起时，却还是如此地看重他？","What then?What did she want?Why had she such an extraordinary hang-over about him?Just because she was his wife?Why did she rather ‘enjoy’ other men—and she was relentless about enjoyment—without ever taking them seriously?And why must she take him so damn seriously, when she never really ‘enjoyed’ him?"
"当然，她曾和他有过快乐的日子，在过去，以前——啊！当初就算有一千件快乐的事，现在也不值一提了。但她已经不喜欢他了。她不再喜欢与他一起厮守。他们之间有着一种挣不断的无言的紧张关系，即使相隔千里也从未消失。","Of course she had had good times with him, in the past, before—ah!Before a thousand things, all amounting really to nothing.But she enjoyed him no more.She never even enjoyed being with him.There was a silent, ceaseless tension between them, that never broke, even when they were a thousand miles apart."
"真可怕！那就是所谓的婚姻！能拿它怎么办呢？可笑，明明知道一切的问题所在，就是不知道拿它如何是好！","Awful!That’s what you call being married!What’s to be done about it?Ridiculous, to know it all and not do anything about it!"
"她又回来了，回到了自己的家里，却感觉自己像个上宾，即使在他面前也是如此。秘书一家人对他算是尽心尽力。","She came back once more, and there she was, in her own house, a sort of super-guest, even to him.And the secretarial family devoting their lives to him."
"把命都献给他了！事实也是如此！三个女人夜以继日地把自己的整个生命都奉献给了他。而她们得到了什么回报呢？连一个吻都没有！工资很低，因为她们知道他还欠着债，所以她们把帮他还债看成了自己终身的事业！别无所求！一天工作十二个小时！相对的与世隔绝，因为他不见任何人。","Devoting their lives to him!But actually!Three women pouring out their lives for him day and night!And what did they get in return?Not one kiss!Very little money, because they knew all about his debts, and had made it their life business to get them paid off!No expectations!Twelve hours’ work a day!Comparative isolation, for he saw nobody!"
"而除此之外呢？什么都没有！也许会有地位提高、受到重视的感觉吧，因为她们有时会在报纸上看到他的名字和照片。但是谁会相信这就够了呢？","And beyond that?Nothing!Perhaps a sense of uplift and importance because they saw his name and photograph in the newspaper sometimes.But would anybody believe that it was good enough?"
"然而她们却喜欢这种感觉。她们看上去十分满足，就像背负使命的人一样。太不可思议了！","Yet they adored it!They seemed to get a deep satisfaction out of it, like people with a mission.Extraordinary!"
"好吧！如果她们愿意，就随她们去吧。当然，她们只是平庸之辈，对她们来说，这其中可能大有魅力。","Well, if they did, let them.They were, of course, rather common, ‘of the people’; there might be a sort of glamour in it for them."
"但这对他来说却不是好事。毋庸置疑。他的作品越来越冗长，质量也每况愈下——这也难怪！难怪他的整体格调都在下降——愈来愈平庸。这对他当然是不利的。","But it was bad for him.No doubt about it.His work was getting diffuse and poor in quality—and what wonder!His whole tone was going down—becoming commoner.Of course it was bad for him."
"作为妻子，她觉得她应该做点什么来挽救他。但她又能如何做呢？对那忠心耿耿、了不起的秘书一家，她又怎么能够去非难他们呢？然而她很想将她们扫地出门。她们确实对他不利：正在葬送他的工作，葬送他作家的名声，葬送他的生活。正在用她们奴隶般的伺候毁灭他。","Being his wife, she felt she ought to do something to save him.But how could she?That perfectly devoted, marvellous secretarial family, how could she make an attack on them?Yet she’d love to sweep them into oblivion.Of course they were bad for him: ruining his work, ruining his reputation as a writer, ruining his life.Ruining him with their slavish service."
"她当然要对她们展开一轮攻击！但她要怎样做呢？如此忠心！而她自己又能做些什么去代替她们呢？她当然不会对他奴隶般地忠心耿耿，也不会去记录他滔滔不绝的口述！绝对不会！","Of course she ought to make an onslaught on them!But how could she?Such devotion!And what had she herself to offer in their place?Certainly not slavish devotion to him, nor to his flow of words!Certainly not!"
"一想到把女秘书及其家人从他身边赶走后他的处境，她就不禁浑身打颤。这就像把光着身子的婴儿丢到垃圾桶一般。不能这么做！","She imagined him stripped once more naked of secretary and secretarial family, and she shuddered.It was like throwing the naked baby in the dust-bin.Couldn’t do that!"
"但总得做些什么。她知道了。她几乎想再欠上一千英镑的负债，然后把账单递送给他，或是像平常一样，差人送给他。","Yet something must be done.She felt it.She was almost tempted to get into debt for another thousand pounds, and send in the bill, or have it sent in to him, as usual."
"不行！要来点更狠的！","But no!Something more drastic!"
"来点狠的，还是来点温和的。她在两者之间摇摆不定。她就这样摇摆不定着，先是什么也没做，打不定主意，之后又茫然地拖了一天又一天，等着养足精神准备再次离开。","Something more drastic, or perhaps more gentle.She wavered between the two.And wavering, she first did nothing, came to no decision, dragged vacantly on from day to day, waiting for sufficient energy to take her departure once more."
"现在是春天！在春天回来，她真是个蠢才。她已经四十岁了！活到了四十岁的蠢女人！","It was spring!What a fool she had been to come up in spring!And she was forty!What an idiot of a woman to go and be forty!"
"一个温暖的下午，鸟儿在树阴里大声叽啾，天空低沉而温暖，她走在花园里，无事可干。花园里到处都是花儿，他爱花，因为它们妖娆多姿。丁香和荚蒾属植物，金链花和红色山楂花，郁金香和银莲花，还有多彩的雏菊。好多花啊！整片的勿忘我！矢车菊！多荒诞的花名啊！她本会叫它们蓝点，黄斑和白褶边的。压根儿不会那么多愁善感！","She went down the garden in the warm afternoon, when birds were whistling loudly from the cover, the sky being low and warm, and she had nothing to do.The garden was full of flowers: he loved them for their theatrical display.Lilac and snowball bushes, and laburnum and red may, tulips and anemones and coloured daisies.Lots of flowers!Borders of forget-me-nots!Bachelor’s buttons!What absurd names flowers had!She would have called them blue dots and yellow blobs and white frills.Not so much sentiment after all!"
"欣欣向荣的绿叶，合唱队姑娘般密集的花朵，这纯粹是春天艳丽做作的无用之物，除非你内心有什么能与之呼应。而她没有。","There is a certain nonsense, something showy and stagey about spring, with its pushing leaves and chorus-girl flowers, unless you have something corresponding inside you.Which she hadn’t."
"噢，上帝啊！她听到篱笆那边传来一个声音，沉稳而充满戏剧效果的声音。噢，上帝！他正在花园里对着秘书口述。天啊！没有地方可以躲开吗？","Oh, heaven!Beyond the hedge she heard a voice, a steady rather theatrical voice.Oh, heaven!He was dictating to his secretary in the garden.Good God, was there nowhere to get away from it!"
"她环顾四周，的确有很多地方可供逃跑。但逃跑的好处是什么呢？他会一直继续。她一边静静地走向篱笆，一边听着。","She looked around: there was indeed plenty of escape.But what was the good of escaping?He would go on and on.She went quietly towards the hedge, and listened."
"他正在口述一篇关于现代小说的杂志文章。“现代小说缺的是结构。”天啊！结构！他不妨这样说：现代小说缺的是鲸须，或是茶匙或是一颗掉落的牙齿。","He was dictating a magazine article about the modern novel.“What the modern novel lacks is architecture.”Good God!Architecture!He might just as well say: What the modern novel lacks is whalebone, or a teaspoon, or a tooth stopped."
"可是秘书仍然记下了，记下，记下！不，不能再这样继续了！任何一个有血有肉的人都不能忍受。","Yet the secretary took it down, took it down, took it down!No, this could not go on!It was more than flesh and blood could bear."
"她静静地沿着篱笆走着，像狼一样地潜行——一个肩宽体壮的女人穿着昂贵的芥末色丝质毛衫和奶油色的百褶裙。她的腿长而匀称，鞋也很贵。","She went quietly along the hedge, somewhat wolf-like in her prowl, a broad, strong woman in an expensive mustard-coloured silk jersey and cream-coloured pleated skirt.Her legs were long and shapely, and her shoes were expensive."
"她像一只好奇的狼，悄悄转过篱笆，朝那个被树阴遮挡的小草坪望去，那儿雏菊正在疯长。“他”斜斜地倚在彩色吊床上，穿着白色的哔叽裤和漂亮的黄色亚麻衬衣，头顶是开着粉红花朵的七叶树。他的手优雅地垂在吊床的一侧，和着他说的话打着模糊的拍子。藤桌边的那个小秘书，穿着绿色针织连衣裙，黑色的头一直埋在笔记本上，勤奋地写着那可怕的速记符号。他的话不难记录，因为他说得很慢，还保持着某种节奏，用他垂着的手打着拍子。","With a curious wolf-like stealth she turned the hedge and looked across at the small, shaded lawn where the daisies grew impertinently.‘He’ was reclining in a coloured hammock under the pink-flowering horse-chestnut tree, dressed in white serge with a fine yellow-coloured linen shirt.His elegant hand dropped over the side of the hammock and beat a sort of vague rhythm to his words.At a little wicker table the little secretary, in a green knitted frock, bent her dark head over her note-book, and diligently made those awful shorthand marks.He was not difficult to take down, as he dictated slowly, and kept a sort of rhythm, beating time with his dangling hand."
"“每部小说都必须有一个能引起我们共鸣的突出角色——我们始终与他感同身受——即使我们意识到了这一点——甚至当我们明显意识到人性的弱点的时候。”","“In every novel there must be one outstanding character with which we always sympathise—with whom we always sympathise—even though we recognise it—even when we are most aware of the human frailties—”"
"每个男人都是自己的英雄，妻子冷冷地想，却忘了每个女人更是自己的女英雄。","Every man his own hero, thought the wife grimly, forgetting that every woman is intensely her own heroine."
"但是一只蓝色的鸟把妻子吓了一跳，它在全神贯注忙着速记的小秘书脚边冲来撞去。它至少是只蓝山雀，带点灰和黄的蓝。但对妻子来说它似乎就是蓝色，在这水灵灵的春日，在这透明的下午。蓝鸟在小秘书那漂亮却很普通的小脚周围扑腾着翅膀。","But what did startle her was a blue bird dashing about near the feet of the absorbed, shorthand-scribbling little secretary.At least it was a blue-tit, blue with grey and some yellow.But to the wife it seemed blue, that juicy spring day, in the translucent afternoon.The blue bird, fluttering round the pretty but rather common little feet of the little secretary."
"蓝鸟啊！幸福的蓝鸟！哎呦，上帝保佑，——妻子想。哎呦，上帝保佑！","The blue bird!The blue bird of happiness!Well, I’m blest,—thought the wife.Well, I’m blest!"
"她正叫老天时，另一只蓝鸟出现了——那是另外一只蓝山雀——开始与第一只角力。一对代表幸福的蓝鸟，为幸福打了起来。哎呦，上帝保佑！","And as she was being blest, appeared another blue bird—that is, another blue-tit—and began to wrestle with the first blue-tit.A couple of blue birds of happiness, having a fight over it!Well, I’m blest!"
"两个专心致志的人几乎都没有看到她。但“他”却被打架的蓝鸟扰到了，它们的小羽毛四处飘散。","She was more or less out of sight of the human preoccupied pair.But ‘he’ was disturbed by the fighting blue birds, whose little feathers began to float loose."
"“走开！”他温柔地对它们说，拿着一块深黄色的手帕挥向它们，“到别处去打你们的小架，解决你们的私事，我亲爱的小绅士们。”","“Get out!” he said to them mildly, waving a dark-yellow handkerchief at them.“Fight your little fight, and settle your private affairs elsewhere, my dear little gentlemen.”"
"小秘书快速地抬头看了一眼，因为她已经开始记下这句话了。他给了她一个扭曲又古怪的笑容。","The little secretary looked up quickly, for she had already begun to write it down.He smiled at her his twisted whimsical smile."
"“不！那个别记！”他温柔地说，“你看到那两只山雀在打架吗？”","“No, don’t take that down,” he said affectionately.“Did you see those two tits laying into one another?”"
"“没！”小秘书说道，欢快地左顾右盼，眼睛由于工作太久而有点暗淡。","“No!” said the little secretary, gazing brightly round, her eyes half-blinded with work."
"然而，当她看到身后的妻子那奇怪、强大、优雅、有如狼一般的身影时，她的眼里马上充满了恐惧。","But she saw the queer, powerful, elegant, wolf-like figure of the wife, behind her, and terror came into her eyes."
"“我看到了！”妻子说，用短裙下那双好奇、匀称、母狼般的腿慢慢走上前来。","“I did!” said the wife, stepping forward with those curious, shapely, she-wolf legs of hers, under the very short skirt."
"“难道它们不是邪恶的小野兽吗？”他说。","“Aren’t they extraordinarily vicious little beasts?” said he."
"“非常邪恶！”她附和道，俯身捡起一根小小的胸部羽毛，“非常邪恶！看看这些羽毛飞得！”","“Extraordinarily!” she re-echoed, stooping and picking up a little breast-feather.“Extraordinarily!See how the feathers fly!”"
"她把羽毛放在指尖上，看着它。接着看看女秘书，然后又看了看他。她的眉间有种奇怪的的表情，就像狼人一般。","And she got the feather on the tip of her finger, and looked at it.Then she looked at the secretary, then she looked at him.She had a queer, were-wolf expression between her brows."
"“我想，”他开口道，“这些应该是最令人愉快的下午了，没有阳光的直射，而所有的声音、颜色和气味都有几分融入到，你也知道，空气里，所有的事物都浸泡着，浸泡在这春日之中。就像在内部，你知道我的意思，像在蛋里面，马上就要破壳而出。”","“I think,” he began, “these are the loveliest afternoons, when there’s no direct sun, but all the sounds and the colours and the scents are sort of dissolved, don’t you know, in the air, and the whole thing is steeped, steeped in spring.It’s like being on the inside; you know how I mean, like being inside the egg and just ready to chip the shell.”"
"“就是那样！”她赞同道，却不确信。","“Quite like that!” she assented, without conviction."
"片刻的停顿。秘书没说话。他们在等着妻子再次离开。","There was a little pause.The secretary said nothing.They were waiting for the wife to depart again."
"“我想，”后者说，“你和平常一样忙吧？”","“I suppose,” said the latter, “you’re awfully busy, as usual?”"
"“和平时差不多。”他说着，不乐意地撅起嘴来。","“Just about the same,” he said, pursing his mouth deprecatingly."
"又是茫然的停顿，他在等她再次离开。","Again the blank pause, in which he waited for her to go away again."
"“我知道我打扰你了。”她说。","“I know I’m interrupting you,” she said."
"“事实上，”他说，“我刚刚只是在看那两只蓝山雀。”","“As a matter of fact,” he said, “I was just watching those two blue-tits.”"
"“一对小魔鬼！”妻子说着，吹走了指尖的黄羽毛。","“Pair of little demons!” said the wife, blowing away the yellow feather from her finger-tip."
"“当然。”他说。","“Absolutely!” he said."
"“好吧，我最好还是走吧，让你继续你的工作。”她说。","“Well, I’d better go, and let you get on with your work,” she said."
"“不急！”他说，神情宽容而冷漠，“事实上，我觉得在户外也做不成什么事。”","“No hurry!” he said, with benevolent nonchalance.“As a matter of fact, I don’t think it’s a great success, working out of doors.”"
"“那你为何还要尝试呢？”妻子说，“你知道你从来无法在户外工作的！”","“What made you try it?” said the wife.“You know you never could do it.”"
"“威克斯奥小姐建议改变一下。但我觉得这没有什么帮助，你认为呢，威克斯奥小姐？”","“Miss Wrexall suggested it might make a change.But I don’t think it altogether helps, do you, Miss Wrexall?”"
"“对不起。”小秘书说。","“I’m sorry,” said the little secretary."
"“为什么要对不起？”妻子说，带着几分仁慈低头看着她，就像一头狼低头看着一只黑棕相间的杂种狗，“我相信你是为他好才这么建议的！”","“Why should you be sorry?” said the wife, looking down at her as a wolf might look down half-benignly at a little black-and-tan mongrel.“You only suggested it for his good, I’m sure!”"
"“我想多呼吸些空气对他可能有好处。”秘书承认道。","“I thought the air might be good for him,” the secretary admitted."
"“为什么像你们这样的人从来不为自己着想？”妻子问。","“Why do people like you never think about yourselves?” the wife asked."
"女秘书看着她的眼睛。","The secretary looked her in the eye."
"“我想我们有为自己着想，只是以一种不同的方式而已。”她说。","“I suppose we do, in a different way,” she said."
"“真是一种非比寻常的方式！”妻子讽刺地说。“为什么不让他想想你呢？”她又加上一句，慢吞吞故意拉长调子地说着，“在这样一个宜人的春日下午，你应该让他向你口述一些诗歌，关于幸福的蓝鸟在你秀美的小脚边飞来飞去的诗。如果我是他的秘书，我知道我会这么做。”","“A very different way!” said the wife ironically.“Why don’t you make him think about you?” she added, slowly, with a sort of drawl.“On a soft spring afternoon like this, you ought to have him dictating poems to you, about the blue birds of happiness fluttering round your dainty little feet.I know I would, if I were his secretary.”"
"一阵死一般的沉寂。妻子一动不动地站着，雕像似的，以她特有的姿态，用背斜对着小秘书。她用背斜对着一切。","There was a dead pause.The wife stood immobile and statuesque, in an attitude characteristic of her, half turning back to the little secretary, half averted.She half turned her back on everything."
"女秘书看着他。","The secretary looked at him."
"“事实上，”他说，“我正在写一篇题为《小说未来》的文章。”","“As a matter of fact,” he said, “I was doing an article on the Future of the Novel.”"
"“我知道。”妻子说，“那太可怕了！为何不写点小说家生活中的趣事呢？”","“I know that,” said the wife.“That’s what’s so awful!Why not something lively in the life of the novelist?”"
"又是一阵持续的沉默，他看起来受到了伤害，有些冷淡，像尊雕像。小秘书耷拉着头。妻子慢慢地走开了。","There was a prolonged silence, in which he looked pained, and somewhat remote, statuesque.The little secretary hung her head.The wife sauntered slowly away."
"“我们刚说到哪儿了，威克斯奥小姐？”他的声音又响了起来。","“Just where were we, Miss Wrexall?” came the sound of his voice."
"小秘书吓了一跳。她感到极度愤怒。他们美好的关系，他和她的，竟被如此侮辱！","The little secretary started.She was feeling profoundly indignant.Their beautiful relationship, his and hers, to be so insulted!"
"但是她很快就转回到连绵不断的口述听写中来了，除了忙碌的喜悦，再没有时间产生任何其他的情绪。","But soon she was veering down-stream on the flow of his words, too busy to have any feelings, except one of elation at being so busy."
"喝茶的时间到了，妹妹端着茶盘走进花园。很快，妻子出现了。她换了衣服，穿了件菊苣蓝的上等布料做的裙子。小秘书收好了她的纸正要离开，她的鞋跟很高。","Tea-time came; the sister brought out the tea-tray into the garden.And immediately, the wife appeared.She had changed, and was wearing a chicory-blue dress of fine cloth.The little secretary had gathered up her papers and was departing, on rather high heels."
"“别走，威克斯奥小姐。”妻子说。","“Don’t go, Miss Wrexall,” said the wife."
"小秘书突然停住了，然后犹豫不决。","The little secretary stopped short, then hesitated."
"“妈妈会等我的。”她说。","“Mother will be expecting me,” she said."
"“告诉她你不去了。叫你妹妹再拿个杯子来。我想你和我们一起喝茶。”","“Tell her you’re not coming.And ask your sister to bring another cup.I want you to have tea with us.”"
"威克斯奥小姐看看那个男人，他正一手撑着吊床，看起来像哈姆雷特一样神秘莫测。","Miss Wrexall looked at the man, who was reared on one elbow in the hammock, and was looking enigmatical, Hamletish."
"他迅速地瞟了她一眼，接着孩子气般不在乎地撅起嘴。","He glanced at her quickly, then pursed his mouth in a boyish negligence."
"“对，就留下和我们一起喝回茶吧，”他说，“我看见草莓了，我知道你喜欢草莓。”","“Yes, stay and have tea with us for once,” he said.“I see strawberries, and I know you’re the bird for them.”"
"她瞟了他一眼，苍白地笑了一下，便匆匆离去去通知她的母亲。她甚至费时换了条丝裙。","She glanced at him, smiled wanly, and hurried away to tell her mother.She even stayed long enough to slip on a silk dress."
"“哇，你多漂亮啊！”妻子说，当小秘书穿着一条菊苣蓝的丝裙再次出现在草坪上时。","“Why, how smart you are!” said the wife, when the little secretary reappeared on the lawn, in chicory-blue silk."
"“噢，别看我的裙子，和您的没法比！”威克斯奥小姐说。他们是同样的颜色，千真万确！","“Oh, don’t look at my dress, compared to yours!” said Miss Wrexall.They were of the same colour, indeed!"
"“至少你是自己赚来的，比我好多了。”妻子边倒茶边说，“你喜欢浓茶吗？”","“At least you earned yours, which is more than I did mine,” said the wife, as she poured tea.“You like it strong?”"
"她用阴郁的眼神看着那这个矮小的年轻女人——她像个小鸟一样被蓝色包裹着，由于工作而过度操劳——妻子的眼神似乎在诉说着许多费解和隐晦的话语。","She looked with her heavy eyes at the smallish, birdy, blue-clad, overworked young woman, and her eyes seemed to speak many inexplicable dark volumes."
"“哦，随便，谢谢。”威克斯奥小姐说道，紧张地向前倾了倾身。","“Oh, as it comes, thank you,” said Miss Wrexall, leaning nervously forward."
"“茶太浓了，会破坏你的消化系统的。”妻子说。","“It’s coming pretty black, if you want to ruin your digestion,” said the wife."
"“哦，那么，我加些水进去吧。”","“Oh, I’ll have some water in it, then.”"
"“那就好多了，我想！”","“Better, I should say.”"
"“工作进行得如何？——还好吧？”妻子问，他们喝着茶，两个女人看着彼此的蓝裙子。","“How’d the work go—all right?” asked the wife, as they drank tea, and the two women looked at each other’s blue dresses."
"“哦！”他说，“同你料想得差不多。它只是一篇纯粹的废话。但这正是他们想要的。糟糕透顶，不是吗，威克斯奥小姐？”","“Oh!” he said.“As well as you can expect.It was a piece of pure flummery.But it’s what they want.Awful rot, wasn’t it, Miss Wrexall?”"
"威克斯奥小姐子在凳子上不安地扭动着。","Miss Wrexall moved uneasily on her chair."
"“我挺感兴趣的，”她说，“虽然不及对那部小说那样感兴趣。”","“It interested me,” she said, “though not so much as the novel.”"
"“那部小说？哪部小说？”妻子问，“又有部新的吗？”","“The novel?Which novel?” said the wife.“Is there another new one?”"
"威克斯奥小姐看着他。她绝不会透露有关他文学活动的任何一个字。","Miss Wrexall looked at him.Not for words would she give away any of his literary activities."
"“哦，我只是大致和威克斯奥小姐说了一个想法。”他说。","“Oh, I was just sketching out an idea to Miss Wrexall,” he said."
"“给我们说说吧！”妻子说，“威克斯奥小姐，告诉我们是关于什么的？”","“Tell us about it!” said the wife.“Miss Wrexall, you tell us what it’s about.”"
"她从椅子上转过身来，凝视着小秘书。","She turned on her chair, and fixed the little secretary."
"“我恐怕”——威克斯奥小姐忸怩着——“我自己也不是很清楚。”","“I’m afraid”—Miss Wrexall squirmed—“I haven’t got it very clearly myself, yet.”"
"“哦，说吧！那就告诉我你知道的！”","“Oh, go along!Tell us what you have got then!”"
"威尔克斯奥小姐坐在那里一时语塞，一副很为难的样子。她感觉自己正在被戏弄。她看着自己裙子上的蓝色褶裥。","Miss Wrexall sat dumb and very vexed.She felt she was being baited.She looked at the blue pleatings of her skirt."
"“我恐怕不能说。”她说。","“I’m afraid I can’t,” she said."
"“为什么恐怕不能？你这么能干！我确信你已经对它了如指掌。我想你为吉先生写了很多书吧？真的。他给你提示，你再把内容全填进去。你不是这么做的吗？”她讽刺地说着，像在逗一个小孩。然后她低头看着自己蓝色裙子的漂亮褶裥，很漂亮华贵。","“Why are you afraid you can’t?You’re so very competent.I’m sure you’ve got it all at your finger-ends.I expect you write a good deal of Mr. Gee’s books for him, really.He gives you the hint, and you fill it all in.Isn’t that how you do it?”She spoke ironically, and as if she were teasing a child.And then she glanced down at the fine pleatings of her own blue skirt, very fine and expensive."
"“你肯定不是在说真的？”威尔克斯奥小姐鼓起勇气说。","“Of course you’re not speaking seriously?” said Miss Wrexall, rising on her mettle."
"“我当然是！我怀疑了很长一段时间——至少有一段时间了——你根据吉先生的提示为他写了很多书。”","“Of course I am!I’ve suspected for a long time—at least, for some time—that you write a good deal of Mr. Gee’s books for him, from his hints.”"
"虽然是用开玩笑的口吻说的，但却很残忍。","It was said in a tone of raillery, but it was cruel."
"“我本应该会受宠若惊的，”威克斯奥小姐站直身子说，“如果我知道你不是只想愚弄我的话！”","“I should be terribly flattered,” said Miss Wrexall, straightening herself, “if I didn’t know you were only trying to make me feel a fool.”"
"“愚弄你？我亲爱的孩子！——为什么？我绝不会那么做！你比我聪明一倍，比我能干百万倍。真的，亲爱的孩子，我非常钦佩你！我做不了你所做的事，就是给我印度所有的珍珠我也办不到。不管怎样我都不能——”","“Make you feel a fool?My dear child!—why, nothing could be farther from me!You’re twice as clever, and a million times as competent as I am.Why, my dear child, I’ve the greatest admiration for you!I wouldn’t do what you do, not for all the pearls in India.I couldn’t anyhow—”"
"威克斯奥小姐闭上了嘴，不再吭声。","Miss Wrexall closed up and was silent."
"“你的意思是我的书读起来像——”他暴跳如雷，用痛苦的声音开始说道。","“Do you mean to say my books read as if—” he began, rearing up and speaking in a harrowed voice."
"“是的！”妻子说，“就像威克斯奥小姐按你提示写出来的一样。我真的以为是她代你写的——当你太忙时——”","“I do!” said the wife.“Just as if Miss Wrexall had written them from your hints.I honestly thought she did—when you were too busy—”"
"“你真聪明！”他说。","“How very clever of you!” he said."
"“特别聪明！”她说，“尤其要是我错了的话！”","“Very!” she said.“Especially if I was wrong!”"
"“你是错了！”他说。","“Which you were,” he said."
"“多奇怪啊！”她喊道，“好吧，又是我错了！”","“How very extraordinary!” she cried.“Well, I am once more mistaken!”"
"完全的沉寂。","There was a complete pause."
"是威克斯奥小姐打破了这一僵局，她紧张地绞着手指。","It was broken by Miss Wrexall, who was nervously twisting her fingers."
"“你想毁掉我们之间的关系，我看得出！”她悲痛地说。","“You want to spoil what there is between me and him, I can see that,” she said bitterly."
"“亲爱的，你和他之间有什么关系？”妻子问。","“My dear, but what is there between you and him?” asked the wife."
"“我乐意和他一起工作，乐意为他工作！为他工作我很快乐！”威克斯奥小姐喊道，眼里充满了气愤和委屈的泪水。","“I was happy working with him, working for him!I was happy working for him!” cried Miss Wrexall, tears of indignant anger and chagrin in her eyes."
"“我亲爱的孩子！”妻子喊道，假装很激动，“继续快乐地和他一起工作啊，如果你可以，继续快乐呀！如果这能让你高兴，为什么不好好享受呢！当然！你觉得我会残忍地剥夺你这个快乐吗？——和他一起工作？我不会速记、打字，和复式记账，或是等等诸如此类的事。我告诉你，我是彻底什么都不会。我从未挣过一分钱。我就是英国橡树的寄生虫，像槲寄生。蓝鸟不会在我脚边拍打翅膀。也许我的脚太大，容易踩到它。”","“My dear child!” cried the wife, with simulated excitement, “go on being happy working with him, go on being happy while you can!If it makes you happy, why then, enjoy it!Of course!Do you think I’d be so cruel as to want to take it away from you?—working with him?I can’t do shorthand and typewriting and double-entrance book-keeping, or whatever it’s called.I tell you, I’m utterly incompetent.I never earn anything.I’m the parasite of the British oak, like the mistletoe.The blue bird doesn’t flutter round my feet.Perhaps they’re too big and trampling.”"
"她低头看着她那双昂贵的鞋。","She looked down at her expensive shoes."
"“如果我要批评谁的话，”她转向丈夫说，“那也是批评你，卡梅伦，因为你从她那得到太多却从不回报。”","“If I did have a word of criticism to offer,” she said turning to her husband, “it would be to you, Cameron, for taking so much from her and giving her nothing.”"
"“但他给了我一切，一切！”威克斯奥小姐喊道，“他给了我一切！”","“But he gives me everything, everything!” cried Miss Wrexall.“He gives me everything!”"
"“你说的一切是指什么？”妻子说，严肃地转向她。","“What do you mean by everything?” said the wife, turning on her sternly."
"威克斯奥小姐突然停住了。空气中仿佛有什么突然折断，气流也发生了变化。","Miss Wrexall pulled up short.There was a snap in the air, and a change of currents."
"“我的意思是你没必要嫉妒我，”小秘书傲慢地说，“我从未干过贬低自己的事。”","“I mean nothing that you need begrudge me,” said the little secretary rather haughtily.“I’ve never made myself cheap.”"
"空白的停顿。","There was a blank pause."
"“我的天！”妻子说，“你那样还说不是贬低自己？哎，我可以说你从未从他那得到任何东西，你只是付出！难道你认为那样还不算贬低你自己——我的天！”","“My God!” said the wife.“You don’t call that being cheap?Why, I should say you got nothing out of him at all, you only give!And if you don’t call that making yourself cheap—my God!”"
"“你看，我们看法不一样！”秘书说。","“You see, we see things different,” said the secretary."
"“我想确实不一样！——感谢上帝！”妻子回答说。","“I should say we do!—thank God!” rejoined the wife."
"“你在代表谁感谢上帝？”他嘲讽地问。","“On whose behalf are you thanking God?” he asked sarcastically."
"“代表每个人，我想！为你，因为你得到一切却不付出，为她，因为她似乎还乐在其中，还为我，因为我还可以置身事外！”","“Everybody’s, I suppose!Yours, because you get everything for nothing, and Miss Wrexall’s, because she seems to like it, and mine because I’m well out of it all.”"
"“你不必置身事外，”威克斯奥小姐大度地喊道，“如果你不让自己置身事外的话。”","“You needn’t be out of it all,” cried Miss Wrexall magnanimously, “if you didn’t put yourself out of it all.”"
"“谢谢你，亲爱的，谢谢你的建议。”妻子说着，站起身，“但恐怕没有人希望两只幸福的蓝鸟在他的脚边扑打翅膀，相互撕扯羽毛！”","“Thank you, my dear, for your offer,” said the wife, rising, “but I’m afraid no man can expect two blue birds of happiness to flutter round his feet, tearing out their little feathers!”"
"说完，她走开了。","With which she walked away."
"在一阵紧张和绝望的停顿后，威克斯奥小姐喊道：“真的，一个女人有必要嫉妒我吗？”","After a tense and desperate interim, Miss Wrexall cried: “And really, need any woman be jealous of me?”"
"“当然！”他说。","“Quite!” he said."
"那就是他说的全部的话。","And that was all he did say."
