"怀着埋在内心深处刀刺般让人心寒、让人心痛的绝望，梅多斯小姐头戴方帽，身穿长袍，拿着小指挥棒，穿行于通往音乐厅的冰冷走廊里。不同年龄的女学生们，脸蛋被风吹得红红的，在秋天晴朗的早晨跑来学校时，抑制不住内心的喜悦和激动，匆匆忙忙、蹦蹦跳跳，蝴蝶似的飞过她的身边，一间间空荡荡的教室里很快传出一阵阵的嗡嗡声，上课的铃声响了，有个鸟鸣般的声音喊着：“缪里尔。”这时楼梯上传来了一阵巨大的撞击声。有人把哑铃弄掉了。","With despair—cold, sharp despair—buried deep in her heart like a wicked knife, Miss Meadows, in cap and gown and carrying a little baton, trod the cold corridors that led to the music hall.Girls of all ages, rosy from the air, and bubbling over with that gleeful excitement that comes from running to school on a fine autumn morning, hurried, skipped, fluttered by; from the hollow class-rooms came a quick drumming of voices; a bell rang; a voice like a bird cried, “Muriel.”And then there came from the staircase a tremendous knock-knock-knocking.Some one had dropped her dumbbells."
"理科女教师叫住了梅多斯小姐。","The Science Mistress stopped Miss Meadows."
"“早上——好。”她用甜美的声音做作地拉着长调喊道，“这天真冷不是？真像冬——天。”","“Good mor—ning,” she cried, in her sweet, affected drawl.“Isn’t it cold?It might be win—ter.”"
"梅多斯小姐心里正刺着绝望那把刀子，满怀仇恨地盯着理科女教师。她这个人浑身上下都像蜂蜜一样甜软。要是你看到有一只蜜蜂被她那头黄发缠绕住了，也不会感到惊讶。","Miss Meadows, hugging the knife, stared in hatred at the Science Mistress.Everything about her was sweet, pale, like honey.You would not have been surprised to see a bee caught in the tangles of that yellow hair."
"“相当冷了。”梅多斯小姐冷冰冰地说。","“It is rather sharp,” said Miss Meadows, grimly."
"对方冲她甜甜地一笑。","The other smiled her sugary smile."
"“你看起来冻——僵了。”她说。她一双蓝眼睛睁得大大的，眼神中带着一丝嘲笑的意味。（难道她看出什么了？）","“You look fro—zen,” said she.Her blue eyes opened wide; there came a mocking light in them.(Had she noticed anything?)"
"“噢，还没那么糟。”梅多斯小姐说，她迅速地对理科女教师做了个鬼脸，算是回敬她的微笑，继续往前走去……","“Oh, not quite as bad as that,” said Miss Meadows, and she gave the Science Mistress, in exchange for her smile, a quick grimace and passed on..."
"四、五、六年级的学生们已经聚集在音乐厅里了。吵闹声震耳欲聋。讲台上，钢琴旁边站着玛丽·比兹利，她是梅多斯小姐最喜欢的学生，负责钢琴伴奏。她正在转动琴凳。她一看见梅多斯小姐就大声发出警告“嘘——嘘！姑娘们！”梅多斯小姐双手插在袖子里，腋下夹着指挥棒，沿着中间过道大步走来，她登上台阶，猛地转过身去，抓起黄铜乐谱架，放在自己面前，用她的指挥棒使劲地敲了两下，示意大家安静下来。　　　　　“请安静！马上安静下来！”她没有瞧任何人，只是扫视了一下穿着各种颜色法兰绒上衣的学生们，她们粉红色的脸蛋和手在晃动着，头上的蝴蝶结也在抖动着，一本本乐谱都打开了。她很清楚她们在想什么。“梅弟发怒了。”好吧，就让她们这么想吧！她眨了眨眼睛，猛地仰头，对抗着她们的目光。那些学生有什么想法跟这个站在讲台上就要流血而死的人有什么关系呢，这个人被刺刀直插心脏，而刺入心脏的是这么一封信——","Forms Four, Five, and Six were assembled in the music hall.The noise was deafening.On the platform, by the piano, stood Mary Beazley, Miss Meadows’ favourite, who played accompaniments.She was turning the music stool.When she saw Miss Meadows she gave a loud, warning “Sh—sh! girls!” and Miss Meadows, her hands thrust in her sleeves, the baton under her arm, strode down the centre aisle, mounted the steps, turned sharply, seized the brass music stand, planted it in front of her, and gave two sharp taps with her baton for silence.“Silence, please!Immediately!” and, looking at nobody, her glance swept over that sea of coloured flannel blouses, with bobbing pink faces and hands, quivering butterfly hair-bows, and music-books outspread.She knew perfectly well what they were thinking.“Meady is in a wax.”Well, let them think it!Her eyelids quivered; she tossed her head, defying them.What could the thoughts of those creatures matter to some one who stood there bleeding to death, pierced to the heart, to the heart, by such a letter—"
"……“我越来越强烈地感觉到我们如果结婚将会酿成大错。不是我不爱你。我爱一个人能有多深，我爱你就有多深，但是，说实话，我得出了一个结论，我不是一个想结婚的男人，一想到安家立业就会使我——”后面“厌烦”这个词被轻轻涂掉了，在上面加上了“后悔”。","... “I feel more and more strongly that our marriage would be a mistake.Not that I do not love you.I love you as much as it is possible for me to love any woman, but, truth to tell, I have come to the conclusion that I am not a marrying man, and the idea of settling down fills me with nothing but—” and the word “disgust” was scratched out lightly and “regret” written over the top."
"巴兹尔！梅多斯小姐大步走到钢琴旁。一直等待这一时刻到来的玛丽·比兹利躬身向前，在她说“早上好，梅多斯小姐”的时候，她的卷发沿面颊而落，她拿着手里的一朵漂亮的黄菊花，向女老师示意了一下，但还没有交到老师的手里。这种小小的献花仪式已经持续了很久，足有一个半学期了。这跟打开琴盖一样，已成为上课的一部分了。但是今天早晨梅多斯小姐并没有接过花来，也没有一边把花别在腰带上，一边弯身对玛丽说：“谢谢你，玛丽。多好的花呀！把书翻到第三十二页 。”使玛丽震惊的是，梅多斯小姐完全忽略了那朵菊花，也没有搭理她的问候，而是用冰冷的声音说：“请把书翻到第十四页，注意重音符。”","Basil!Miss Meadows stalked over to the piano.And Mary Beazley, who was waiting for this moment, bent forward; her curls fell over her cheeks while she breathed, “Good morning, Miss Meadows,” and she motioned towards rather than handed to her mistress a beautiful yellow chrysanthemum.This little ritual of the flower had been gone through for ages and ages, quite a term and a half.It was as much part of the lesson as opening the piano.But this morning, instead of taking it up, instead of tucking it into her belt while she leant over Mary and said, “Thank you, Mary.How very nice!Turn to page thirty-two,” what was Mary’s horror when Miss Meadows totally ignored the chrysanthemum, made no reply to her greeting, but said in a voice of ice, “Page fourteen, please, and mark the accents well.”"
"这瞬间真叫人难以置信！玛丽的脸红了，眼眶里也噙满了泪水，然而梅多斯小姐已经回到谱架前；她的声音回响在整个音乐厅里。","Staggering moment!Mary blushed until the tears stood in her eyes, but Miss Meadows was gone back to the music stand; her voice rang through the music hall."
"“第十四页。我们从第十四页开始。《哀歌》。好，姑娘们，你们现在应该清楚了。我们一起唱，不分声部，一起来。不要有表情。但是要唱得朴素，用左手打拍子。”","“Page fourteen.We will begin with page fourteen.‘A Lament.’Now, girls, you ought to know it by this time.We shall take it all together; not in parts, all together.And without expression.Sing it, though, quite simply, beating time with the left hand.”"
"她举起了指挥棒；敲了两下乐谱架。开头的和弦由玛丽奏出，所有的左手都在打着拍子，年轻而又伤感的嗓音伴着乐曲整齐地唱了起来：——","She raised the baton; she tapped the music stand twice.Down came Mary on the opening chord; down came all those left hands, beating the air, and in chimed those young, mournful voices:—"
"“匆匆！啊，欢乐的玫瑰凋谢得太匆匆；","“Fast!Ah, too Fast Fade the Ro—o—ses of Pleasure;"
"瞬息间秋去，沉闷的冬天来临。","Soon Autumn yields,unto Wi—i—nter Drear."
"飞逝！啊，音乐的欢乐飞逝。弹指间，","Fleetly!Ah, Fleetly Mu—u—sic’s Gay.Measure"
"优美的乐曲从耳边逝去。”","Passes away from the Listening Ear.”"
"天哪，没有比这支哀歌更悲惨的了！每个音符都是一声哀叹，一声哭泣，一声肝肠欲断般的呻吟。梅多斯小姐抬起了藏在宽大长袍里的双臂，开始用双手指挥起来。“……我越来越强烈地感觉到我们如果结婚将会酿成大错……”她打着节拍。歌声唱道：“飞逝！啊，时光飞逝。”是什么使他写了这么一封信！是什么使他这么做！什么原因都没有。他的上一封信写的都是关于他买的一个烘制栎木书架，用来摆放“我们俩的”书，还写了他看到“一个时髦的小衣帽架”，“一件很精致的东西，撑架上雕刻着一只猫头鹰，猫头鹰的爪子上抓着三把帽刷。”当时看信时，她笑得多么开心啊！一个人用三把帽刷，只有他这样的人才想得出！“优美的乐曲从耳边逝去。”歌声唱着。","Good Heavens, what could be more tragic than that lament!Every note was a sigh, a sob, a groan of awful mournfulness.Miss Meadows lifted her arms in the wide gown and began conducting with both hands.“... I feel more and more strongly that our marriage would be a mistake...”she beat.And the voices cried: “Fleetly!Ah, Fleetly.”What could have possessed him to write such a letter!What could have led up to it!It came out of nothing.His last letter had been all about a fumed-oak bookcase he had bought for “our” books, and a “natty little hall-stand” he had seen, “a very neat affair with a carved owl on a bracket, holding three hat-brushes in its claws.”How she had smiled at that!So like a man to think one needed three hat-brushes!“From the Listening Ear,” sang the voices."
"“再唱一遍。”梅多斯小姐说，“但是这次分声部唱。还是不要带表情。”“匆匆！啊，太匆匆。”加上了女低音的忧郁唱调，任何人听了都会禁不住浑身战栗，“欢乐的玫瑰花匆匆凋谢。”上一次巴兹尔来看她时，扣眼上还插着一支玫瑰花。穿上那套亮蓝色的西装，配上深红色的玫瑰，他看起来多么英俊啊！他也知道这一点。他不可能不知道这一点。他先摸了一下头发，然后摸了摸胡子；他笑起来时牙齿闪着亮光。","“Once again,” said Miss Meadows.“But this time in parts.Still without expression.”“Fast!Ah, too Fast.”With the gloom of the contraltos added, one could scarcely help shuddering.“Fade the Roses of Pleasure.”Last time he had come to see her, Basil had worn a rose in his buttonhole.How handsome he had looked in that bright blue suit, with that dark red rose!And he knew it, too.He couldn’t help knowing it.First he stroked his hair, then his moustache; his teeth gleamed when he smiled."
"“校长太太老是请我吃饭。真是讨厌。在那个地方我没有一个晚上独处过。”","“The headmaster’s wife keeps on asking me to dinner.It’s a perfect nuisance.I never get an evening to myself in that place.”"
"“可是你不会拒绝吗？”","“But can’t you refuse?”"
"“噢，算了，处在我这种位置的男人不与人交往是行不通的。”","“Oh, well, it doesn’t do for a man in my position to be unpopular.”"
"“欢快的音乐节奏。”大家悲伤地唱道。又高又窄的窗子外面，柳树在随风摇曳。树叶掉了一半。幼小的树叶紧贴在树枝上，像上了钩的鱼儿苦苦挣扎。“……我不是一个想结婚的男人……”歌声停下来了，钢琴在等待伴奏。","“Music’s Gay Measure,” wailed the voices.The willow trees, outside the high, narrow windows, waved in the wind.They had lost half their leaves.The tiny ones that clung wriggled like fishes caught on a line.“... I am not a marrying man…” The voices were silent; the piano waited."
"“很好。”梅多斯小姐说，她仍然用奇怪、生硬的语调说话，年龄较小的女孩子开始真的害怕了。“既然大家都学会了，那我们带着表情唱。尽可能多带些表情。想想歌词，姑娘们。发挥你们的想象力。‘匆匆！啊，太匆匆。’”梅多斯小姐喊道，“这一句应该从口中爆发出来——一个嘹亮有力的强音——一首哀歌。第二行‘沉闷的冬天’，要把‘沉闷’唱得有如一阵寒风呼啸而过。‘沉——闷！’”她这个词发音发得很恐怖，以至于琴凳上的玛丽·比兹利都不寒而栗了，“第三行应该是渐强音。‘飞逝！啊，音乐的欢乐飞逝。’唱到最后一行的第一个字‘弹’时要停顿一下。唱到下一个词‘指间’时，你们的声音要开始减弱……逐渐变小……一直唱到‘逝去’时声音变成微弱的低语声……最后一行可以尽量慢唱。准备，开始。”","“Quite good,” said Miss Meadows, but still in such a strange, stony tone that the younger girls began to feel positively frightened.“But now that we know it, we shall take it with expression.As much expression as you can put into it.Think of the words, girls.Use your imaginations.‘Fast!Ah, too Fast,’” cried Miss Meadows.“That ought to break out—a loud, strong forte—a lament.And then in the second line, ‘Winter Drear,’ make that ‘Drear’ sound as if a cold wind were blowing through it.‘Dre—ear!’” said she so awfully that Mary Beazley, on the music stool, wriggled her spine.“The third line should be one crescendo.‘Fleetly!Ah, Fleetly Music’s Gay Measure.’Breaking on the first word of the last line ‘Passes.’And then on the word, ‘Away,’ you must begin to die... to fade... until ‘The Listening Ear’ is nothing more than a faint whisper... You can slow down as much as you like almost on the last line.Now, please.”"
"她再一次轻轻地敲了两下，又一次举起双臂。‘匆匆！啊，太匆匆。’“……一想到安家立业就会使我厌烦——”而“厌烦”就是他写下的词。这实际上就是明确说出他们的婚约终止了！终止了！他们的婚约！听说她订了婚，大家都吃惊不已。理科女教师一开始就不相信。但是没有人比她自己更吃惊了。她三十了。巴兹尔二十五。真是个奇迹，简直就是奇迹。那个黑夜，他们从教堂往家里走时，她听见他说：“你知道，不知怎的，我喜欢上你了。”他还握紧了她的鸵鸟毛披肩的一头。“优美的乐曲从耳边逝去。”","Again the two light taps; she lifted her arms again.‘Fast!Ah, too Fast.’“... and the idea of settling down fills me with nothing but disgust—” Disgust was what he had written.That was as good as to say their engagement was definitely broken off.Broken off!Their engagement!People had been surprised enough that she had got engaged.The Science Mistress would not believe it at first.But nobody had been as surprised as she.She was thirty.Basil was twenty-five.It had been a miracle, simply a miracle, to hear him say, as they walked home from church that very dark night, “You know, somehow or other, I’ve got fond of you.”And he had taken hold of the end of her ostrich feather boa.“Passes away from the Listening Ear.”"
"“再唱一遍！再唱一遍！”梅多斯小姐说，“表情再丰富些，姑娘们！再来一遍！”","“Repeat!Repeat!” said Miss Meadows.“More expression, girls!Once more!”"
"“匆匆！啊，太匆匆。”年龄大些的姑娘们脸变成了绯红色；年龄较小的几个姑娘开始哭起来。大滴的雨点吹打到窗户上，可以听到柳树在低语：“……不是我不爱你……”","“Fast!Ah, too Fast.”The older girls were crimson; some of the younger ones began to cry.Big spots of rain blew against the windows, and one could hear the willows whispering, “... not that I do not love you... ”"
"“可是，亲爱的，如果你爱我，”梅多斯小姐想，“我不介意你爱我的程度有多深。只要你有一点爱我就可以。”但是她知道他不爱她。他都没有注意到要把“厌烦”这个词擦掉，免得她看出来！“瞬息间秋去，沉闷的冬天来临。”她也不得不离开学校了。解除婚约的事情一旦传开，她可就无法面对理科女教师和那些姑娘们了。她不得不躲到某个地方去，消失不见。“逝去。”声音开始减弱，逐渐变小，变成低语声……消失……","“But, my darling, if you love me,” thought Miss Meadows, “I don’t mind how much it is.Love me as little as you like.”But she knew he didn’t love her.Not to have cared enough to scratch out that word “disgust,” so that she couldn’t read it!“Soon Autumn yields unto Winter Drear.”She would have to leave the school, too.She could never face the Science Mistress or the girls after it got known.She would have to disappear somewhere.“Passes away.”The voices began to die, to fade, to whisper... to vanish..."
"忽然间门开了。一个穿着蓝色衣服的小女孩局促不安地从过道那边走来，低着头，咬着嘴唇，转着她那红红的小手腕上的银镯子。她走到台阶上，在梅多斯小姐面前站住了。","Suddenly the door opened.A little girl in blue walked fussily up the aisle, hanging her head, biting her lips, and twisting the silver bangle on her red little wrist.She came up the steps and stood before Miss Meadows."
"“嘿，莫妮卡，有什么事吗？”","“Well, Monica, what is it?”"
"“噢，梅多斯小姐，如果您愿意，”小女孩气喘嘘嘘地说，“怀亚特小姐想见您，想让您去一趟校长办公室。”","“Oh, if you please, Miss Meadows,” said the little girl, gasping, “Miss Wyatt wants to see you in the mistress’s room.”"
"“很好。”梅多斯小姐说。然后她冲姑娘们喊道：“在我出去的时候，我相信你们会自觉保持安静。”然而姑娘们已经心里压抑得做不了别的事情了。大多数人都在抽鼻子。","“Very well,” said Miss Meadows.And she called to the girls, “I shall put you on your honour to talk quietly while I am away.”But they were too subdued to do anything else.Most of them were blowing their noses."
"走廊里又静又冷，只有梅多斯小姐脚步回响在其中。校长正在办公室里工作。有一会儿她头都没抬。她像往常一样摘下眼镜，眼镜钩住了她的花边领带。“坐吧，梅多斯小姐。”她很友善地说。接着她从吸墨水纸旁拿起了一个粉红色信封，“刚才我叫人找你，是因为这封电报是发给你的。”","The corridors were silent and cold; they echoed to Miss Meadows’ steps.The head mistress sat at her desk.For a moment she did not look up.She was as usual disentangling her eyeglasses, which had got caught in her lace tie.“Sit down, Miss Meadows,” she said very kindly.And then she picked up a pink envelope from the blotting-pad.“I sent for you just now because this telegram has come for you.”"
"“发给我的电报，怀亚特小姐？”","“A telegram for me, Miss Wyatt?”"
"巴兹尔！他一定是自杀了，梅多斯小姐心里想。她急着伸手去拿，但是怀特小姐一时握着电报不放。“我希望不是坏消息。”她说，态度更友善了。梅多斯小姐撕开了信封。","Basil!He had committed suicide, decided Miss Meadows.Her hand flew out, but Miss Wyatt held the telegram back a moment.“I hope it’s not bad news,” she said, so more than kindly.And Miss Meadows tore it open."
"“前信请勿介意，实属胡言疯语，今已购置帽架——巴兹尔。”她读道。她简直没法把视线从电报上移开。","“Pay no attention to letter, must have been mad, bought hat-stand today—Basil,” she read.She couldn’t take her eyes off the telegram."
"“我希望没什么严重的事情。”怀亚特小姐探着身子说道。","“I do hope it’s nothing very serious,” said Miss Wyatt, leaning forward."
"“噢，没有，谢谢你，怀亚特小姐。”梅多斯小姐脸上泛起了红晕，“的确不是坏消息。就是”——她抱歉地微微一笑——“我未婚夫来信说……说——”她停顿了一下。“我清楚了。”怀亚特小姐说。然后又停顿了一下。接着说道——“离下课还有十五分钟，是不是，梅多斯小姐？”","“Oh, no, thank you, Miss Wyatt,” blushed Miss Meadows.“It’s nothing bad at all.It’s”—and she gave an apologetic little laugh—“it’s from my fiance saying that... saying that—” There was a pause.“I see,” said Miss Wyatt.And another pause.Then—“You’ve fifteen minutes more of your class, Miss Meadows, haven’t you?”"
"“是的，怀亚特小姐。”她站了起来。她几乎是跑着朝门口走去。","“Yes, Miss Wyatt.”She got up.She half ran towards the door."
"“噢，等一下，梅多斯小姐。”怀亚特小姐说，“我得讲明我不赞成教师们在工作时间内收到电报，除非是很糟糕的消息，比如死亡，”梅多斯小姐解释道，“或是非常严重的事故，或是类似的事情。梅多斯小姐，你知道好事不易传开。”","“Oh, just one minute, Miss Meadows,” said Miss Wyatt.“I must say I don’t approve of my teachers having telegrams sent to them in school hours, unless in case of very bad news, such as death,” explained Miss Wyatt, “or a very serious accident, or something to that effect.Good news, Miss Meadows, will always keep, you know.”"
"插上了希望、爱情和喜悦的翅膀，梅多斯小姐飞跑回音乐厅，跑过过道，跑上台阶，跑到钢琴旁。","On the wings of hope, of love, of joy, Miss Meadows sped back to the music hall, up the aisle, up the steps, over to the piano."
"“第三十二页，玛丽，”她说，“第三十二页。”接着她拿起那朵黄菊花，把花放到唇边，掩饰住笑容。然后她转向姑娘们，敲着指挥棒说：“第三十二页，姑娘们。第三十二页。”","“Page thirty-two, Mary,” she said, “page thirty-two,” and, picking up the yellow chrysanthemum, she held it to her lips to hide her smile.Then she turned to the girls, rapped with her baton: “Page thirty-two, girls.Page thirty-two.”"
"“我们来到此地，携着鲜花盈筐，","“We come here To-day with Flowers o’erladen,"
"还有满篮的佳果和彩带，","With Baskets of Fruit and Ribbons to boot,"
"来庆贺……","To-oo Congratulate..."
"“停！停！”梅多斯小姐喊道，“太糟糕。太难听。”她笑盈盈地看着姑娘们，“你们都怎么啦？”想一想，姑娘们，想一想你们在唱什么歌。发挥你们的想象力。‘鲜花盈筐，还有满篮的佳果和彩带，’还要‘来庆贺’。”梅多斯小姐突然停了下来，“不要这么哀伤，姑娘们。应该唱出温暖、欢快、热切之情。‘庆贺。’再来一遍。快。一起唱。开始！”","“Stop!Stop!” cried Miss Meadows.“This is awful.This is dreadful.”And she beamed at her girls.“What’s the matter with you all?Think, girls, think of what you’re singing.Use your imaginations.‘With Flowers o’erladen.Baskets of Fruit and Ribbons to boot.’And ‘Congratulate.’” Miss Meadows broke off.“Don’t look so doleful, girls.It ought to sound warm, joyful, eager.‘Congratulate.’Once more.Quickly.All together.Now then!”"
"这一次梅多斯小姐的声音压过了其他所有的人———歌声丰满、深切、生机勃勃而富有感染力。","And this time Miss Meadows’ voice sounded over all the other voices—full, deep, glowing with expression."
