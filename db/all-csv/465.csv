"美人李婉","Li-wan, the Fair"
"作者：杰克·伦敦","by Jack London"
"“太阳落下了，卡尼姆，热气也散了！”","“The sun sinks, Canim, and the heat of the day is gone!”"
"李婉对一个把头埋在松鼠皮袍下的男人这样说道，但她说得很轻，好像有义务把他叫醒却又害怕他会醒来似的。因为她害怕她身材魁梧的大丈夫，他和她认识的其他男人都不一样。驼鹿肉不稳定地吱吱作响，于是她把煎锅往红色余火的边上挪了挪。她边做着边警惕地扫了那两条哈得孙湾狗一眼，只见它们紧盯着她的一举一动，鲜红舌头急不可耐地滴着口水。它们是那种体型高大、多毛的动物，蜷伏在背风处借着火堆发出的薄烟来躲避成群的蚊子。李婉向斜坡下望去，克朗代克河高涨的河水从两山间流过，一只狗像蠕虫一般向前爬行，爪子像猫一样把一大块滚烫的肉掏到了地上。但是李婉用余光看到了它，它啪地跳了回去，厉声咆哮起来，因为李婉用一根柴火棒敲了一下它的鼻子。","So called Li Wan to the man whose head was hidden beneath the squirrel-skin robe, but she called softly, as though divided between the duty of waking him and the fear of him awake.For she was afraid of this big husband of hers, who was like unto none of the men she had known.The moose-meat sizzled uneasily, and she moved the frying-pan to one side of the red embers.As she did so she glanced warily at the two Hudson Bay dogs dripping eager slaver from their scarlet tongues and following her every movement.They were huge, hairy fellows, crouched to leeward in the thin smoke-wake of the fire to escape the swarming myriads of mosquitoes.As Li Wan gazed down the steep to where the Klondike flung its swollen flood between the hills, one of the dogs bellied its way forward like a worm, and with a deft, catlike stroke of the paw dipped a chunk of hot meat out of the pan to the ground.But Li Wan caught him from out the tail of her eye, and he sprang back with a snap and a snarl as she rapped him over the nose with a stick of firewood."
"“不许这样，欧乐。”她大笑着把肉放了回去，眼睛依旧看着那条狗。“你总是饿，所以你的鼻子给你带来了无尽的麻烦。”","“Nay, Olo,” she laughed, recovering the meat without removing her eye from him.“Thou art ever hungry, and for that thy nose leads thee into endless troubles.”"
"可是欧乐的伙伴加入了它，和它一起挑战这个女人。一阵阵的愤怒使它们背上和肩上的毛发都竖了起来，它们薄薄的嘴唇扭动着，耸起难看的皱褶，露出能把肉撕碎的尖牙，又凶残又吓人。它们的鼻子呈锯齿状，残暴地抖动着，他们像狼一样咆哮，犬族的仇恨和狠毒驱使它们跳向李婉，把她拖倒在地。","But the mate of Olo joined him, and together they defied the woman.The hair on their backs and shoulders bristled in recurrent waves of anger, and the thin lips writhed and lifted into ugly wrinkles, exposing the flesh-tearing fangs, cruel and menacing.Their very noses serrulated and shook in brute passion, and they snarled as the wolves snarl, with all the hatred and malignity of the breed impelling them to spring upon the woman and drag her down."
"“还有你，巴什，和你的主人一样残忍，并且从不和喂养你的人和平相处！争吵和你无关，那个给你了！还有那个！”","“And thou, too, Bash, fierce as thy master and never at peace with the hand that feeds thee!This is not thy quarrel, so that be thine! and that!”"
"她呼喊着，用柴火驱赶它们，但是他们躲过了袭击，不肯后退。它们两个分开，从两边接近她，伏向地面，还咆哮着。从李婉在圆锥形帐篷里一摞摞皮毛中间蹒跚的时候，她就在和狼狗争夺统治权，她明白眼前是一个危机。巴什停了下来，它为前扑的动作绷紧了肌肉，而欧乐正要爬到攻击距离以内。","As she cried, she drove at them with the firewood, but they avoided the blows and refused to retreat.They separated and approached her from either side, crouching low and snarling.Li Wan had struggled with the wolf-dog for mastery from the time she toddled among the skin-bales of the teepee, and she knew a crisis was at hand.Bash had halted, his muscles stiff and tense for the spring; Olo was yet creeping into striking distance."
"她握住两根烧着的棍子烧焦的那一头，面对着这两个畜生。一条狗后退了，可是巴什跳了起来，她在半空中用这个燃烧的武器击中了它。巴什在土里打滚，空气中立刻传来痛苦的狺狺声，还有毛肉燃烧的味道，李婉将余火未尽的小木块塞到它嘴里了。它大声地叫着，快速转到李婉够不着的边侧，极为害怕地爬着以求安全。另一侧，欧乐已经开始向后撤，李婉抄起一根木头，重重地扔到它的肋骨上，提醒它这里谁做主。接着，在柴火接二连三的攻击下，那两只狗趴在帐篷边，一会儿舔舔伤口，一会儿呜咽咆哮。","Grasping two blazing sticks by the charred ends, she faced the brutes.The one held back, but Bash sprang, and she met him in mid-air with the flaming weapon.There were sharp yelps of pain and swift odors of burning hair and flesh as he rolled in the dirt and the woman ground the fiery embers into his mouth.Snapping wildly, he flung himself sidewise out of her reach and in a frenzy of fear scrambled for safety.Olo, on the other side, had begun his retreat, when Li Wan reminded him of her primacy by hurling a heavy stick of wood into his ribs.Then the pair retreated under a rain of firewood, and on the edge of the camp fell to licking their wounds and whimpering by turns and snarling."
"李婉把肉上的灰吹掉，然后坐了下来。她心情一点波动都没有，这件事已经过去，生活就是如此。刚才混乱的时候，卡尼姆动也没动，相反，他大声地打着鼾。","Li Wan blew the ashes off the meat and sat down again.Her heart had not gone up a beat, and the incident was already old, for this was the routine of life.Canim had not stirred during the disorder, but instead had set up a lusty snoring."
"“起来，卡尼姆！”她叫道，“白天的热气已经散了，咱们该启程了。”","“Come, Canim!” she called.“The heat of the day is gone, and the trail waits for our feet.”"
"松鼠皮袍子动了动，一条棕色的胳膊把它掀到了一边。接着，那个男人的眼皮动了一下又合上了。","The squirrel-skin robe was agitated and cast aside by a brown arm.Then the man’s eyelids fluttered and drooped again."
"“他的包很重，”她想，“而且早上的活计把他累坏了。”","“His pack is heavy,” she thought, “and he is tired with the work of the morning.”"
"一只蚊子叮在她脖子上，她顺手从附近拿起一个泥球，糊在没有湿泥保护的地方。整个早上，两人都在分水岭吃力地赶路，周围一大群虫子，浑身涂满了粘土，太阳下一晒，他们的脸上就像糊了一层粘土面具。这些面具随着面部肌肉的活动而裂开，需要不时地重新抹上泥土，因而厚度不均、不同角度有其各异的模样。","A mosquito stung her on the neck, and she daubed the unprotected spot with wet clay from a ball she had convenient to hand.All morning, toiling up the divide and enveloped in a cloud of the pests, the man and woman had plastered themselves with the sticky mud, which, drying in the sun, covered their faces with masks of clay.These masks, broken in divers places by the movement of the facial muscles, had constantly to be renewed, so that the deposit was irregular of depth and peculiar of aspect."
"李婉不停地轻推着卡尼姆，直到他醒过来坐起身。他先是扫了一眼太阳，依照天空计时器估摸着时间的早晚，接着弓着背向火边狼吞虎咽地吃起肉来。他是一个高大的印第安人，足足有六英尺那么高，胸膛结实，肌肉发达，比起其他印第安人，他的目光更有神，他的头脑更有活力。意志力在他的脸上留下深刻的痕迹，还有一种严厉和原始的气质，昭示着天生不屈的性格和坚定的意志，而一旦遭受失败时，就容易郁郁寡欢、愠怒残暴。","Li Wan shook Canim gently but with persistence till he roused and sat up.His first glance was to the sun, and after consulting the celestial timepiece he hunched over to the fire and fell-to ravenously on the meat.He was a large Indian fully six feet in height, deep-chested and heavy-muscled, and his eyes were keener and vested with greater mental vigor than the average of his kind.The lines of will had marked his face deeply, and this, coupled with a sternness and primitiveness, advertised a native indomitability, unswerving of purpose, and prone, when thwarted, to sullen cruelty."
"“李婉，咱们明天大吃一顿。”他吸干了一根骨头的髓液，然后把骨头扔给了狗。“咱们用猪油煎甜燕麦饼，加点糖，会更好吃——”","“To-morrow, Li Wan, we shall feast.”He sucked a marrow-bone clean and threw it to the dogs.“We shall have flapjacks fried in bacon grease, and sugar, which is more toothsome—”"
"“甜燕麦饼？”她问道，好奇地说出这个词。","“Flapjacks?” she questioned, mouthing the word curiously."
"“是的。”卡尼姆得意地回答，“我还会教你一些新做法。我说，你对我说的这些事一无所知，还有很多其他的事情你也不知道呢。你一直生活在地球的一个小角落里，什么都不知道。而我，”——他直了直身子，骄傲地望向她——“我是一个伟大的旅行者，哪儿都去过，还和白人一块儿呆过，我熟悉他们的做事方法，还了解很多其他民族。我不是一棵树，生来就只站在一个地方，不知道山那边是什么；我是卡尼姆，一条独木舟，天生就要到处游历、上下求索、四处探寻。”","“Ay,” Canim answered with superiority; “and I shall teach you new ways of cookery.Of these things I speak you are ignorant, and of many more things besides.You have lived your days in a little corner of the earth and know nothing.But I,”—he straightened himself and looked at her pridefully,—“I am a great traveller, and have been all places, even among the white people, and I am versed in their ways, and in the ways of many peoples.I am not a tree, born to stand in one place always and know not what there be over the next hill; for I am Canim, the Canoe, made to go here and there and to journey and quest up and down the length and breadth of the world.”"
"她恭顺地点点头。“没错。以前我一直呆在地球的一个小角落里，整日吃的都是鱼、肉和浆果。我也从来没想过世界是这么大，直到你把我从我的族人中偷走，之后在这没有尽头的旅途中，我为你做饭、背行李。”她突然抬头看他。“告诉我，卡尼姆，这旅途有尽头吗？”","She bowed her head humbly.“It is true.I have eaten fish and meat and berries all my days and lived in a little corner of the earth.Nor did I dream the world was so large until you stole me from my people and I cooked and carried for you on the endless trails.”She looked up at him suddenly.“Tell me, Canim, does this trail ever end?”"
"“没有。”他答道，“我的旅途就像是这世界，无穷无尽。我的旅途就是世界，从我会走的那天起，我就在旅行，而我会一直旅行下去直到我死。我很久没去看我的父母了，他们也许已经死了，可是我不在乎。我的部落和你的一样。它停留在一个地方——离这里很远的地方——不过不关心，因为我是卡尼姆，一条独木舟！”","“Nay,” he answered.“My trail is like the world; it never ends.My trail is the world, and I have travelled it since the time my legs could carry me, and I shall travel it until I die.My father and my mother may be dead, but it is long since I looked upon them, and I do not care.My tribe is like your tribe.It stays in the one place—which is far from here,—but I care naught for my tribe, for I am Canim, the Canoe!”"
"“我已经很累了，我还必须跟随你的足迹一直到死吗？”","“And must I, Li Wan, who am weary, travel always your trail until I die?”"
"“李婉，你是我的妻子，妻子无论在哪里都要追随丈夫的脚步。这是法。如果它不是法律的规定，那也是卡尼姆的规矩，卡尼姆为他自己和他的所有物制定法律。”","“You, Li Wan, are my wife, and the wife travels the husband’s trail wheresoever it goes.It is the law.And were it not the law, yet would it be the law of Canim, who is lawgiver unto himself and his.”"
"她又点了点头，因为她只知道一个法，就是男人是女人的主人。","She bowed her head again, for she knew no other law than that man was the master of woman."
"“但是别着急，”卡尼姆提醒她，因为她已经开始把简陋的帐篷用具捆起来放进背包里，“太阳的热气还没散呢，而且咱们走的是下坡路，位置也不错。”","“Be not in haste,” Canim cautioned her, as she began to strap the meagre camp outfit to her pack.“The sun is yet hot, and the trail leads down and the footing is good.”"
"她顺从地丢下工作，又坐了回去。","She dropped her work obediently and resumed her seat."
"卡尼姆饶有兴趣地打量着她。“你不像别的女人那样蹲坐在腿上。”他说道。","Canim regarded her with speculative interest.“You do not squat on your hams like other women,” he remarked."
"“是的，”她答道，“那样一点也不舒服。让我觉得很累，而且我没法那样歇着。”","“No,” she answered.“It never came easy.It tires me, and I cannot take my rest that way.”"
"“那为什么不把脚往前伸直呢？”","“And why is it your feet point not straight before you?”"
"“不知道，也许我的脚和其他女人的脚长得不一样吧。”","“I do not know, save that they are unlike the feet of other women.”"
"他的眼中闪过一丝满意的神情，但仅此而已，他没有任何其他的表示。","A satisfied light crept into his eyes, but otherwise he gave no sign."
"“你的头发像其他女人一样是黑色的；但是你有没有注意到它很柔软光滑，比其他女人的要软要光滑？”","“Like other women, your hair is black; but have you ever noticed that it is soft and fine, softer and finer than the hair of other women?”"
"“我注意到了。”她回答得很短，她不高兴他如此冷酷地计算自己缺乏哪些女性特点。","“I have noticed,” she answered shortly, for she was not pleased at such cold analysis of her sex-deficiencies."
"“我把你从你的族人中偷走已经一年了，”他接着说，“而你也没有当初我第一眼看见你时那么害羞和怕我了。怎么会变成这样？”","“It is a year, now, since I took you from your people,” he went on, “and you are nigh as shy and afraid of me as when first I looked upon you.How does this thing be?”"
"李婉摇摇头。“我怕你，卡尼姆，你这么高大，这么奇怪。而且，见到你之前，我就害怕所有的青年男子。我不知道……我说不清……不知怎么，只是觉得好像我不属于他们似的，好像……”","Li Wan shook her head.“I am afraid of you, Canim, you are so big and strange.And further, before you looked upon me even, I was afraid of all the young men.I do not know...I cannot say...only it seemed, somehow, as though I should not be for them, as though...”"
"“嗯，”他催促她说，对她的吞吞吐吐有点不耐烦。","“Ay,” he encouraged, impatient at her faltering."
"“好像他们不是我中意的那种人。”","“As though they were not my kind.”"
"“不是你中意的那种人？”他一个字一个字地问道。“那你中意什么样的人？”","“Not your kind?” he demanded slowly.“Then what is your kind?”"
"“我不知道，我……”她困惑地摇摇头。“我说不出来自己的感觉。我觉得我自己很奇怪。其他女孩总是工于心计地找男人，可我却不像她们那样。我无法用那种方式关注青年男子。好像那样的行为很不正当，是一种不好的行为似的。”","“I do not know, I...”She shook her head in a bewildered manner.“I cannot put into words the way I felt.It was strangeness in me.I was unlike other maidens, who sought the young men slyly.I could not care for the young men that way.It would have been a great wrong, it seemed, and an ill deed.”"
"“你最早的记忆是什么？”卡尼姆突然打断她，转移到别的话题上。","“What is the first thing you remember?”Canim asked with abrupt irrelevance."
"“我妈妈，宝华芹。”","“Pow-Wah-Kaan, my mother.”"
"“在宝华芹之前再不记得别人了吗？”","“And naught else before Pow-Wah-Kaan?”"
"“不记得了。”","“Naught else.”"
"可是卡尼姆死盯着她的眼睛，搜寻着她隐秘的灵魂，察觉到她的灵魂在颤抖。","But Canim, holding her eyes with his, searched her secret soul and saw it waver."
"“想想，好好想想，李婉！”他威胁道。","“Think, and think hard, Li Wan!” he threatened."
"她支支吾吾，眼神里满是可怜和乞求，可是他的意志掌控着她，逼她说出她不想说的话。","She stammered, and her eyes were piteous and pleading, but his will dominated her and wrung from her lips the reluctant speech."
"“可那只是梦，卡尼姆，儿时的噩梦，不真实的幻影，就像狗儿们在温暖的太阳下打盹时看到并对着吠叫的幻像。”","“But it was only dreams, Canim, ill dreams of childhood, shadows of things not real, visions such as the dogs, sleeping in the sun-warmth, behold and whine out against.”"
"“告诉我，”他命令道，“你妈妈宝华芹之前的事情。”","“Tell me,” he commanded, “of the things before Pow-Wah-Kaan, your mother.”"
"“我已经不记得了。”她抗议道。“小时候，我总是睁着眼做白日梦，当我说起那些稀奇古怪的事情时，我发现别人会笑话我，然后其他孩子都害怕我，不理我。而当我把自己看见的事情告诉宝华芹时，她训斥我，说那些都是邪恶的，她还打我。我觉得，那是一种病，就像老人们会衰弱生病一样。很快，我就恢复了，再也不做梦了。而现在……我都记不得了”——她迷茫地把手举到额头前——“它们在这儿，某个地方，可是我找不到了，只有……”","“They are forgotten memories,” she protested.“As a child I dreamed awake, with my eyes open to the day, and when I spoke of the strange things I saw I was laughed at, and the other children were afraid and drew away from me.And when I spoke of the things I saw to Pow-Wah-Kaan, she chided me and said they were evil; also she beat me.It was a sickness, I believe, like the falling-sickness that comes to old men; and in time I grew better and dreamed no more.And now...I cannot remember”—she brought her hand in a confused manner to her forehead—“they are there, somewhere, but I cannot find them, only...”"
"“只有。”卡尼姆握着她，重复说道。","“Only,” Canim repeated, holding her."
"“只有一件事。不过你会笑话我愚蠢的，那太不真实了。”","“Only one thing.But you will laugh at its foolishness, it is so unreal.”"
"“不，李婉。梦就是梦。它们也许是我们前世的记忆。我曾经是一只驼鹿。我在梦里的所闻所见，让我坚信以前我就是一只驼鹿。”","“Nay, Li Wan.Dreams are dreams.They may be memories of other lives we have lived.I was once a moose.I firmly believe I was once a moose, what of the things I have seen in dreams, and heard.”"
"虽然他努力地想要掩饰，但脸上还是渐渐地露出了些许焦虑，可是李婉正在脑海里苦苦找寻词语来形容自己的梦境，并没注意到他的表情。","Strive as he would to hide it, a growing anxiety was manifest, but Li Wan, groping after the words with which to paint the picture, took no heed."
"“在树林里我看见一片白雪覆盖的空地，”她开始讲了，“在雪地上一个男人模样的东西，他手脚并用地使劲爬。我还看见了那个雪里的男人，而且在我看他的时候，我似乎离他很近。他不像是真正的人，因为他的脸上有毛，很重的毛发，他脸上和头上的毛发是黄色的，就像鼬鼠在夏天时皮毛的颜色。他的眼睛一开始是合着的，后来他又睁开眼，四处搜寻。那双眼睛和天空一样蓝，当我们四目相对时，他停止了搜寻。他的手挪动着，很慢，好像是因为虚弱，而且我感到……”","“I see a snow-tramped space among the trees,” she began, “and across the snow the sign of a man where he has dragged himself heavily on hand and knee.And I see, too, the man in the snow, and it seems I am very close to him when I look.He is unlike real men, for he has hair on his face, much hair, and the hair of his face and head is yellow like the summer coat of the weasel.His eyes are closed, but they open and search about.They are blue like the sky, and look into mine and search no more.And his hand moves, slow, as from weakness, and I feel...”"
"“嗯，”卡尼姆嘶哑地低声说，“你感到——？”","“Ay,” Canim whispered hoarsely.“You feel—?”"
"“不！不！”她急忙大叫。“我什么都没感觉到。我刚才说‘感到’了么？我不是这个意思。那不是我想说的意思。我看到，只是看到，我只看到这些——一个男人在雪地里，眼珠如天空一样蓝，头发像鼬鼠一样黄。我梦见了很多次，总是同样的场景——一个男人在雪地里——”","“No! no!” she cried in haste.“I feel nothing.Did I say ‘feel’?I did not mean it.It could not be that I should mean it.I see, and I see only, and that is all I see—a man in the snow, with eyes like the sky, and hair like the weasel.I have seen it many times, and always it is the same—a man in the snow—”"
"“你看见你自己了吗？”他问道，身子前倾，专注地看着她。“你有没有见过自己和那个男人一起在雪地里？”","“And do you see yourself?” he asked, leaning forward and regarding her intently.“Do you ever see yourself and the man in the snow?”"
"“为什么我应该看见自己？难道我不是个真人吗？","“Why should I see myself?Am I not real?”"
"他的肌肉放松了下来，向后躺去，眼中闪现出一种欣喜和满意的神情，他背过身，好不让李婉看见。","His muscles relaxed and he sank back, an exultant satisfaction in his eyes which he turned from her so that she might not see."
"“我告诉你，李婉，”他坚定地说，“你看到这件事的时候，你正处于你的前世，那时你是一只小鸟，一只小驼鹿鸟，所以你才会一直记得。这并不奇怪。我以前是一只驼鹿，我的爷爷后来变成了一只熊——萨满是这么说的，他是不会撒谎的。于是，我们在众神的轨道中轮回，只有众神知晓和理解其中的原委。梦和梦的幻影不过是记忆，温暖的阳光下于睡梦中狺狺的狗，无疑也看见和记起了从前的事情。那边的巴什，以前是一名战士。我坚信他以前是一名战士。”","“I will tell you, Li Wan,” he spoke decisively; “you were a little bird in some life before, a little moose-bird, when you saw this thing, and the memory of it is with you yet.It is not strange.I was once a moose, and my father’s father afterward became a bear—so said the shaman, and the shaman cannot lie.Thus, on the Trail of the Gods we pass from life to life, and the gods know only and understand.Dreams and the shadows of dreams be memories, nothing more, and the dog, whining asleep in the sun-warmth, doubtless sees and remembers things gone before.Bash, there, was a warrior once.I do firmly believe he was once a warrior.”"
"卡尼姆向那畜生扔了一块骨头，然后站起身。“来，咱们动身吧。虽然阳光还很烈，但是一会儿也凉快不了多少。”","Canim tossed a bone to the brute and got upon his feet.“Come, let us begone.The sun is yet hot, but it will get no cooler.”"
"“那么那些白人，他们长什么样？”李婉壮着胆子问道。","“And these white people, what are they like?”Li Wan made bold to ask."
"“就像你我一样，”他答道，“只是肤色白一点。天黑之前，你就可以见到他们了。”","“Like you and me,” he answered, “only they are less dark of skin.You will be among them ere the day is dead.”"
"卡尼姆把睡袍塞进他那150磅重的背包里，往脸上糊满湿粘土，然后就坐下来休息，等李婉把狗套好。欧乐看到她手中的棍子就害怕，李婉毫不费劲就给它套上了40多磅重的包裹。可是巴什愤愤不平，气势汹汹，李婉把担子压到它身上时，它竟然忍不住呜咽咆哮起来。李婉拉紧绳索的时候，它便竖起了背上的毛，还露出牙齿，向李婉身后和旁边扫视，把天性中的邪恶全都表现出来了。卡尼姆咯咯地笑了，说道，“我不是说过它曾经是一名非常伟大的战士吗？”","Canim lashed the sleeping-robe to his one-hundred-and-fifty-pound pack, smeared his face with wet clay, and sat down to rest till Li Wan had finished loading the dogs.Olo cringed at sight of the club in her hand, and gave no trouble when the bundle of forty pounds and odd was strapped upon him.But Bash was aggrieved and truculent, and could not forbear to whimper and snarl as he was forced to receive the burden.He bristled his back and bared his teeth as she drew the straps tight, the while throwing all the malignancy of his nature into the glances shot at her sideways and backward.And Canim chuckled and said, “Did I not say he was once a very great warrior?”"
"“这些毛皮能值点钱。”他边说边调整自己头上的带子，把背包从地上拎了起来。“值个好价钱。白人会给个好价钱的，因为他们没有时间打猎，也不禁冻。我们马上能大吃一顿了，李婉，你几辈子都不会见过这么多好吃的。”","“These furs will bring a price,” he remarked as he adjusted his head-strap and lifted his pack clear of the ground.“A big price.The white men pay well for such goods, for they have no time to hunt and are soft to the cold.Soon shall we feast, Li Wan, as you have feasted never in all the lives you have lived before.”"
"她嘟囔了一下表示承认，以及对她主人屈尊俯就表示感谢，然后钻进挽具，身体前倾负起行李。","She grunted acknowledgment and gratitude for her lord’s condescension, slipped into the harness, and bent forward to the load."
"“下一次出生的时候，我要做个白人。”他加了一句，顺着一条通向脚下山谷的小路走了下去。","“The next time I am born, I would be born a white man,” he added, and swung off down the trail which dived into the gorge at his feet."
"狗紧跟在他身后，而李婉则跟在最后头。但是她的思绪飘得很远，穿过冰山去了东方，去了那个她儿时生活过的角落。她记得，在她还是孩子的时候，人们就觉得她很奇怪，有点毛病。她的确做过白日梦，还因为看到一些不同寻常的幻影而被训斥和殴打，直到过了一段时间，她长大成熟，不再做梦。但不是完全不做。虽然它们不再在她醒着的时候烦扰她，可是它们却来到了她的梦中。成年后，她总是做恶梦，梦里都是飘动的轮廓，模糊又没有意义。和卡尼姆的谈话激起了她的回忆，在分水岭歪歪斜斜的沟壑里，她重新回到了梦中那些嘲弄人的幻想中。","The dogs followed close at his heels, and Li Wan brought up the rear.But her thoughts were far away, across the Ice Mountains to the east, to the little corner of the earth where her childhood had been lived.Ever as a child, she remembered, she had been looked upon as strange, as one with an affliction.Truly she had dreamed awake and been scolded and beaten for the remarkable visions she saw, till, after a time, she had outgrown them.But not utterly.Though they troubled her no more waking, they came to her in her sleep, grown woman that she was, and many a night of nightmare was hers, filled with fluttering shapes, vague and meaningless.The talk with Canim had excited her, and down all the twisted slant of the divide she harked back to the mocking fantasies of her dreams."
"“咱们歇会儿吧。”卡尼姆说，那时他们正走到了一条主流的河床中间。","“Let us take breath,” Canim said, when they had tapped midway the bed of the main creek."
"他把背包放在一块突起的石头上，松开头上的带子，坐了下来。李婉也跟着他坐了下来，狗则趴在旁边的土地上喘气。在他们的脚下，山峦上冰川的融水泛着涟漪，可这水很污浊，好像被大地的喧闹弄脏了似的。","He rested his pack on a jutting rock, slipped the head-strap, and sat down.Li Wan joined him, and the dogs sprawled panting on the ground beside them.At their feet rippled the glacial drip of the hills, but it was muddy and discolored, as if soiled by some commotion of the earth."
"“怎么会这样？”李婉问道。","“Why is this?”Li Wan asked."
"“因为在这里工作的白人。你听！”他举起他的手，他们听到镐和铁锹的声音，还有人说话的声音。“他们都疯了，为了挖到金子不停地工作。金子？金子是黄色的，来自于大地，人们认为它的价值很高。它也是一种价格单位。”","“Because of the white men who work in the ground.Listen!”He held up his hand, and they heard the ring of pick and shovel, and the sound of men’s voices.“They are made mad by gold, and work without ceasing that they may find it.Gold?It is yellow and comes from the ground, and is considered of great value.It is also a measure of price.”"
"可是李婉环顾四周，注意力不再集中在他身上。下面几英里处，一小片云杉的掩映之下，一座座圆木做成的小屋，立起来迎接在它上面高悬的泥土房顶。她突然感到一阵激动，所有的幻影都浮现出来，不安地骚动着。","But Li Wan’s roving eyes had called her attention from him.A few yards below and partly screened by a clump of young spruce, the tiered logs of a cabin rose to meet its overhanging roof of dirt.A thrill ran through her, and all her dream-phantoms roused up and stirred about uneasily."
"“卡尼姆。”她痛苦地轻声叫着。“卡尼姆，那是什么？”","“Canim,” she whispered in an agony of apprehension.“Canim, what is that?”"
"“白人的帐篷，是他们吃饭睡觉的地方。”","“The white man’s teepee, in which he eats and sleeps.”"
"她渴望地看着那木屋，一下就明白了它的好处，那些无法言喻的感受又令她激动起来。“霜冻的时候，那里面肯定很暖和。”她大声地说，虽然她觉得自己发出的声音肯定十分奇怪。","She eyed it wistfully, grasping its virtues at a glance and thrilling again at the unaccountable sensations it aroused.“It must be very warm in time of frost,” she said aloud, though she felt that she must make strange sounds with her lips."
"她忍不住要叫出那小屋的名字，可是她没说，而卡尼姆随即说道：“这叫小木屋。”","She felt impelled to utter them, but did not, and the next instant Canim said, “It is called a cabin.”"
"她的心猛地跳了一下。小木屋！就是小木屋！她突然惶恐地望向四周。她从没听过这个奇怪的词，那她是怎么知道的呢？这是怎么回事？接着，震惊之下，带着恐惧和兴奋，她此生第一次意识到她的梦的启示是理性和有意义的。","Her heart gave a great leap.The sounds! the very sounds!She looked about her in sudden awe.How should she know that strange word before ever she heard it?What could be the matter?And then with a shock, half of fear and half of delight, she realized that for the first time in her life there had been sanity and significance in the promptings of her dreams."
"“小木屋，”她对着自己重复道，“小木屋。”不连续的梦境不停地往上涌，直到她觉得头晕目眩，心好像要炸开了。阴影、不断靠近的事物、莫名其妙的联想在飘动回旋，她徒劳地努力用意识抓住它们。因为她觉得在那里，那些混乱的记忆中，有那个谜团的关键；只要她能抓住这个关键，一切都将变得清晰明白——","“Cabin.” she repeated to herself.“Cabin.”An incoherent flood of dream-stuff welled up and up till her head was dizzy and her heart seemed bursting.Shadows, and looming bulks of things, and unintelligible associations fluttered and whirled about, and she strove vainly with her consciousness to grasp and hold them.For she felt that there, in that welter of memories, was the key of the mystery; could she but grasp and hold it, all would be clear and plain—"
"哦，卡尼姆！哦，宝华芹！哦，全是阴影和幻影，是什么东西呢？","O Canim!O Pow-Wah-Kaan!O shades and shadows, what was that?"
"她转向卡尼姆，浑身颤抖，一句话也说不出来，那些梦幻疯狂而又迷乱，压在心头。她感到头晕想吐，只能听到木屋里传来令人陶醉的美妙节奏。","She turned to Canim, speechless and trembling, the dream-stuff in mad, overwhelming riot.She was sick and fainting, and could only listen to the ravishing sounds which proceeded from the cabin in a wonderful rhythm."
"“嗯，是小提琴。”卡尼姆肯定地说。","“Hum, fiddle,” Canim vouchsafed."
"但是她没有听见他的话，因为她正处于狂喜之中，终于，似乎一切都开始变得清晰了。现在！现在！她想。她的眼眶突然湿润了，泪水滑落她的脸颊。谜团正在一步步解开，但是一阵晕厥攫住了她。只要她能撑得久一点！只要——可是景象扭曲了，弯折了，山峰在天空中来回摇晃，她站直了身子，尖叫起来：“爸爸！爸爸！”接着太阳晃动起来，一片黑暗击中了她，她感到身子软软的，一头往前栽倒在岩石间。","But she did not hear him, for in the ecstasy she was experiencing, it seemed at last that all things were coming clear.Now! now! she thought.A sudden moisture swept into her eyes, and the tears trickled down her cheeks.The mystery was unlocking, but the faintness was overpowering her.If only she could hold herself long enough!If only—but the landscape bent and crumpled up, and the hills swayed back and forth across the sky as she sprang upright and screamed, “Daddy!Daddy!”Then the sun reeled, and darkness smote her, and she pitched forward limp and headlong among the rocks."
"卡尼姆看了看她的脖子，想知道是不是被沉重的背包压断了，然后他满意地咕噜了一声。接着他从溪涧里取了些水，泼在她的脸上。她慢慢地醒了过来，抽泣着，坐了起来。","Canim looked to see if her neck had been broken by the heavy pack, grunted his satisfaction, and threw water upon her from the creek.She came to slowly, with choking sobs, and sat up."
"“这可不好，烈日正当头。”他试着让她停下哭泣。","“It is not good, the hot sun on the head,” he ventured."
"她答道：“嗯，是不好，我身上的包让我很辛苦。”","And she answered, “No, it is not good, and the pack bore upon me hard.”"
"“我们应该早点扎营，这样你就可以多睡会儿，恢复体力了。”他温柔地说，“如果咱们现在走，就能早点睡觉了。”","“We shall camp early, so that you may sleep long and win strength,” he said gently.“And if we go now, we shall be the quicker to bed.”"
"李婉什么也没说，只是顺从他，摇晃着站起身来，把狗也赶了起来。她机械地随着他的步伐，跟着他路过小木屋，连气都不敢出。门是开着的，烟气从铁皮烟囱里袅袅升起，但里面什么声音也没有。","Li Wan said nothing, but tottered to her feet in obedience and stirred up the dogs.She took the swing of his pace mechanically, and followed him past the cabin, scarce daring to breathe.But no sounds issued forth, though the door was open and smoke curling upward from the sheet-iron stovepipe."
"他们在溪流弯处遇到一个人，白皮肤，蓝眼睛，一瞬间，雪地里的那个人又出现在李婉眼前。可是她看不清楚，因为她刚刚经历的一切让她虚弱疲倦。不过，她还是好奇地看着那个人，和卡尼姆一块停下来看他工作。他正在一个大盘子里洗沙砾，斜着盘子，一圈一圈地转着；他看到有人在看他，便熟练地一挥，晃了晃盘子底部宽条纹处闪亮的黄金。","They came upon a man in the bend of the creek, white of skin and blue of eye, and for a moment Li Wan saw the other man in the snow.But she saw dimly, for she was weak and tired from what she had undergone.Still, she looked at him curiously, and stopped with Canim to watch him at his work.He was washing gravel in a large pan, with a circular, tilting movement; and as they looked, giving a deft flirt, he flashed up the yellow gold in a broad streak across the bottom of the pan."
"“这条河很富有。”他们继续往前走的时候，卡尼姆对她说道。“有一天我会找到这么条河，那个时候我就会成为一个大人物啦。”","“Very rich, this creek,” Canim told her, as they went on.“Sometime I will find such a creek, and then I shall be a big man.”"
"两边的木屋和人逐渐多了起来，最后河流的主干道在他们面前延伸开来。眼前是一片被蹂躏的土地。这片土地到处都很凌乱，像是一位泰坦巨人的蛮力所致。满地除了隆起的沙堆，就是张着大口的孔穴、深沟和裂层，那些裂层上地球的厚厚表皮被扒开了，露出底下的基岩。那里没有河流固有的河道，河水积在一起，分流进峡沟处，飞溅到空气中，令人眼花，然后水又流到低洼处，又被大水车提离地面，为人们上千次地反复使用。山上的树都被砍去了，土地的这一伤处千疮百孔，上面有一些木滑道和探矿钻的孔。整体上看，这群人像是一个庞大的蚂蚁军团——尘土满面、污秽不堪、蓬头散发。他们从自己挖的洞里钻进钻出，像大虫子一样沿着峡沟爬，在碎石堆上奋力干着，汗流浃背。那碎石堆在他们的捣鼓下不停地变化。目光所及之处，都是不停不歇的人们，就连山顶上都有，他们挖啊，撕扯啊，在大自然的脸庞上搜寻着。","Cabins and men grew more plentiful, till they came to where the main portion of the creek was spread out before them.It was the scene of a vast devastation.Everywhere the earth was torn and rent as though by a Titan’s struggles.Where there were no upthrown mounds of gravel, great holes and trenches yawned, and chasms where the thick rime of the earth had been peeled to bed-rock.There was no worn channel for the creek, and its waters, dammed up, diverted, flying through the air on giddy flumes, trickling into sinks and low places, and raised by huge water-wheels, were used and used again a thousand times.The hills had been stripped of their trees, and their raw sides gored and perforated by great timber-slides and prospect holes.And over all, like a monstrous race of ants, was flung an army of men—mud-covered, dirty, dishevelled men, who crawled in and out of the holes of their digging, crept like big bugs along the flumes, and toiled and sweated at the gravel-heaps which they kept in constant unrest—men, as far as the eye could see, even to the rims of the hilltops, digging, tearing, and scouring the face of nature."
"李婉被这巨大的动荡震住了。“真的，这些人都疯了。”她对卡尼姆说。","Li Wan was appalled at the tremendous upheaval.“Truly, these men are mad,” she said to Canim."
"“没什么好奇怪的。他们要找的金子是一种很好的东西，”他回答说，“这世上最好的东西。”","“Small wonder.The gold they dig after is a great thing,” he replied.“It is the greatest thing in the world.”"
"一连几个小时，他们在贪婪所制造的乱象中穿行，卡尼姆既急切又专注，李婉却是虚弱倦怠。她知道自己正处于解开谜团的边缘，并且感到自己依然处在这个边缘，可是精神的紧张让她很累，她消极地等待着，不知道会发生什么。她感到每只手都猛然抓住她，向她转达数不清的印象，每一个印象都在轻轻刺激她疲惫不堪的想象。她身体里的某个地方正在回应外面这一切，已经遗忘的和从未梦见过的联系正在被更新着；她意识到这一切，但她并不关心，她的心很乱，可是没有因为变化和理解而感到快乐。所以她疲惫地拖着身子，跟在她主人的身后，心满意足地等着，因为她知道，在某个地方，以某种方式，一定会有什么事情发生。","For hours they threaded the chaos of greed, Canim eagerly intent, Li Wan weak and listless.She knew she had been on the verge of disclosure, and she felt that she was still on the verge of disclosure, but the nervous strain she had undergone had tired her, and she passively waited for the thing, she knew not what, to happen.From every hand her senses snatched up and conveyed to her innumerable impressions, each of which became a dull excitation to her jaded imagination.Somewhere within her, responsive notes were answering to the things without, forgotten and undreamed—of correspondences were being renewed; and she was aware of it in an incurious way, and her soul was troubled, but she was not equal to the mental exultation necessary to transmute and understand.So she plodded wearily on at the heels of her lord, content to wait for that which she knew, somewhere, somehow, must happen."
"在经过人类疯狂的阻挠之后，河流终于回到了它原来的轨道。这番折磨之后，河水变得浑浊肮脏，懒懒地盘绕在宽阔的平地上和茂盛的林地间，峡谷从那里开始一直到谷口都变得更加宽阔。在这里，已经没什么“黄金”了，人们看到挣钱的希望渺茫，都不愿继续在此徘徊。就在这里，李婉停了下来，用杆子捅了下欧乐，这时她听到了一个女子银铃般的笑声。","After undergoing the mad bondage of man, the creek finally returned to its ancient ways, all soiled and smirched from its toil, and coiled lazily among the broad flats and timbered spaces where the valley widened to its mouth.Here the “pay” ran out, and men were loth to loiter with the lure yet beyond.And here, as Li Wan paused to prod Olo with her staff, she heard the mellow silver of a woman’s laughter."
"一名妇人正坐在木屋前，她皮肤白皙，像婴儿一样脸色红润，面带酒窝，笑着和门口的另一个女子说着话。但是那坐着的女人晃动着一头漆黑、潮湿的头发，发上的湿气接受着太阳温暖的抚摸。","Before a cabin sat a woman, fair of skin and rosy as a child, dimpling with glee at the words of another woman in the doorway.But the woman who sat shook about her great masses of dark, wet hair which yielded up its dampness to the warm caresses of the sun."
"一瞬间，李婉呆住了。接着她感到一片炫目的闪光，啪的一声，好像有什么东西坏了似的；接着，木屋前的女子消失了，木屋和高高的云杉也消失了，还有那参差不齐的天际线，都一起不见了。而李婉看到另外一个女子在另外一个太阳下，梳着浓密的黑发，一边还唱着歌。李婉听见了歌词，也明白歌词的意思。她又回到了孩童时代。她被一幅景象击中，所有令人烦扰的梦境都交织在一起变成了一个梦，各种形态和影象循着它们惯常的路径，一切都变得清晰、明白而又真实。许多画面争推挤着经过她的脑海，奇怪的景象、树、花，还有人；她看清了他们，也认识他们。","For an instant Li Wan stood transfixed.Then she was aware of a blinding flash, and a snap, as though something gave way; and the woman before the cabin vanished, and the cabin and the tall spruce timber, and the jagged sky-line, and Li Wan saw another woman, in the shine of another sun, brushing great masses of black hair, and singing as she brushed.And Li Wan heard the words of the song, and understood, and was a child again.She was smitten with a vision, wherein all the troublesome dreams merged and became one, and shapes and shadows took up their accustomed round, and all was clear and plain and real.Many pictures jostled past, strange scenes, and trees, and flowers, and people; and she saw them and knew them all."
"“那时你是一只小鸟，小驼鹿鸟。”卡尼姆说道，他盯着她，眼神如烙铁一般。","“When you were a little bird, a little moose-bird,” Canim said, his eyes upon her and burning into her."
"“那时我是一只小驼鹿鸟。”她低语道，声音又弱又低，他几乎都听不到。她把头低向连着重物的皮带，明白自己撒了谎，然后继续沿着小路前行。","“When I was a little moose-bird,” she whispered, so faint and low he scarcely heard.And she knew she lied, as she bent her head to the strap and took the swing of the trail."
"这就是让人感到奇怪的地方，真实的事物现在都变得不真实了。数英里的跋涉和在河边搭帐篷就好像是噩梦的一个片段。她煮了肉，喂完狗，把包解开，就好像在梦里一样，直到卡尼姆开始描绘他的下一段旅程，她才恢复过来。","And such was the strangeness of it, the real now became unreal.The mile tramp and the pitching of camp by the edge of the stream seemed like a passage in a nightmare.She cooked the meat, fed the dogs, and unlashed the packs as in a dream, and it was not until Canim began to sketch his next wandering that she became herself again."
"“克朗代克河流入育空河，”他说着，“育空河是一条大河，比你知道的那个麦肯齐河要大。所以咱们，你和我，到育空河的要塞那里去。冬天，带着狗，20天就到了。然后咱们沿着育空河往西去——100天，也许200天——我没听人说过。那里很远。接着咱们就到海边了。你不了解大海吧，让我来告诉你。就好像湖是相对于岛屿而言的，大海是相对于陆地而言的；所有的河流都会流进大海，它是无边无际的。我在哈得孙湾看过一次海，还在阿拉斯加见到过。然后咱们就乘一艘巨大的独木舟过海，你和我，李婉，或许咱们会沿着海岸线去南方，那得要好几百天。再往下会发生什么我就不知道了，我只知道自己是卡尼姆，一条独木舟，周游世界的流浪者和远行者！”","“The Klondike runs into the Yukon,” he was saying; “a mighty river, mightier than the Mackenzie, of which you know.So we go, you and I, down to Fort o’ Yukon.With dogs, in time of winter, it is twenty sleeps.Then we follow the Yukon away into the west—one hundred sleeps, two hundred—I have never heard.It is very far.And then we come to the sea.You know nothing of the sea, so let me tell you.As the lake is to the island, so the sea is to the land; all the rivers run to it, and it is without end.I have seen it at Hudson Bay; I have yet to see it in Alaska.And then we may take a great canoe upon the sea, you and I, Li Wan, or we may follow the land into the south many a hundred sleeps.And after that I do not know, save that I am Canim, the Canoe, wanderer and far-journeyer over the earth!”"
"她坐在那里听着，在她想着这意味着一头扎进无止无尽的荒凉，恐惧就咬噬着她的心。“这条路让人疲乏。”她就说了这一句，无奈地把头低向膝盖。","She sat and listened, and fear ate into her heart as she pondered over this plunge into the illimitable wilderness.“It is a weary way,” was all she said, head bowed on knee in resignation."
"接着她想到一个极好的主意，一想到它，她就满面红光。她走到溪边，洗掉了脸上干透的泥土。等到水面重归平静之后，她长时间地盯着自己的倒影；风吹雨打，烈日娇阳，她的皮肤已经变得黝黑、粗糙，不再像婴儿一样，柔软细嫩、面带酒窝。但是她仍旧觉得那个主意极好，当她钻进睡袍，躺在丈夫身边时，心中还是十分欢喜。","Then it was a splendid thought came to her, and at the wonder of it she was all aglow.She went down to the stream and washed the dried clay from her face.When the ripples died away, she stared long at her mirrored features; but sun and weather-beat had done their work, and, what of roughness and bronze, her skin was not soft and dimpled as a child’s.But the thought was still splendid and the glow unabated as she crept in beside her husband under the sleeping-robe."
"她没有合眼，仰望蔚蓝的天宇，等着卡尼姆陷入第一天的沉睡之中。当他睡着后，她慢慢地、小心翼翼地把身子挪了出来，再掖好睡袍，站起身来。她才迈出第二步，巴什就拼命地狂吠。她轻声地叫唤那狗，让它别吼，然后看了一眼那个男人。卡尼姆大声地打着鼾。接着，她转过身，毫无声息地迅速往回飞奔。","She lay awake, staring up at the blue of the sky and waiting for Canim to sink into the first deep sleep.When this came about, she wormed slowly and carefully away, tucked the robe around him, and stood up.At her second step, Bash growled savagely.She whispered persuasively to him and glanced at the man.Canim was snoring profoundly.Then she turned, and with swift, noiseless feet sped up the back trail."
"伊夫琳·范·怀克夫人正准备睡觉。社会给她加负的职责、她的财富，以及寡居的独身之福都令她感到厌倦，于是她来到北部地带，在淘金区边上一个惬意的小木屋生活。这里，在朋友兼同伴默特尔·吉丁斯的帮助和唆使下，她开始了一种贴近土地的生活，抛弃礼数，耕种着原始的土地。","Mrs. Evelyn Van Wyck was just preparing for bed.Bored by the duties put upon her by society, her wealth, and widowed blessedness, she had journeyed into the Northland and gone to housekeeping in a cosey cabin on the edge of the diggings.Here, aided and abetted by her friend and companion, Myrtle Giddings, she played at living close to the soil, and cultivated the primitive with refined abandon."
"她努力远离代代相传的现代文化和谈吐高雅的文明人，转而寻找她的祖先们业已失去的大地情结。同样，她改变心境，天真地以为能接近石器时代人们的那种心理状态。刚才她挽起头发准备睡觉时，还沉浸在一个旧石器时代的人向她求爱的幻想中。她幻想自己居住在岩洞中，里面有碎裂的髓骨，间或有些凶残的食肉动物，多毛的猛犸象，还要用粗糙的燧石刀来拼杀打斗，不过那感觉真是不错。正当伊夫林·范·怀克被那个眉毛歪斜、身着毛皮的求爱者辛苦不迭地追赶着，在森林里阴冷的小径上快速穿行时，木屋的门开了，一个身着毛皮、原始而野蛮的女人连门都没敲就闯了进来。","She strove to get away from the generations of culture and parlor selection, and sought the earth-grip her ancestors had forfeited.Likewise she induced mental states which she fondly believed to approximate those of the stone-folk, and just now, as she put up her hair for the pillow, she was indulging her fancy with a palaeolithic wooing.The details consisted principally of cave-dwellings and cracked marrow-bones, intersprinkled with fierce carnivora, hairy mammoths, and combats with rude flaked knives of flint; but the sensations were delicious.And as Evelyn Van Wyck fled through the sombre forest aisles before the too arduous advances of her slant-browed, skin-clad wooer, the door of the cabin opened, without the courtesy of a knock, and a skin-clad woman, savage and primitive, came in."
"“上帝啊！”","“Mercy!”"
"吉丁斯小姐一下子跳了起来，这得归功于山洞的女人。她安全地落在了桌子的后面。但是范·怀克夫人并没有慌乱。她注意到那擅自闯入者兴奋异常，于是自己快速地回头一望，确保一直到床边都并无障碍物，而那体积很大的科尔特左轮手枪就放在枕头下面。","With a leap that would have done credit to a cave-woman, Miss Giddings landed in safety behind the table.But Mrs. Van Wyck held her ground.She noticed that the intruder was laboring under a strong excitement, and cast a swift glance backward to assure herself that the way was clear to the bunk, where the big Colt’s revolver lay beneath a pillow."
"“你好哦，一头秀发的女人。”李婉说道。","“Greeting, O Woman of the Wondrous Hair,” said Li Wan."
"但她用的是自己的语言，一种仅在世界一个小角落使用的语言，范·怀克夫人没有听懂。","But she said it in her own tongue, the tongue spoken in but a little corner of the earth, and the women did not understand."
"“我要找人来帮忙吗？”吉丁斯小姐有些颤抖。","“Shall I go for help?”Miss Giddings quavered."
"“我想这个可怜的家伙没什么恶意。”范·怀克夫人回答道，“你看看她的皮衣服，很破，还因为赶路而磨损了，其他的东西也是这样。它们多特别。我要买下来收藏。请把袋子给我，默特尔，再摆好秤。”","“The poor creature is harmless, I think,” Mrs. Van Wyck replied.“And just look at her skin-clothes, ragged and trail-worn and all that.They are certainly unique.I shall buy them for my collection.Get my sack, Myrtle, please, and set up the scales.”"
"李婉看着那个女人的口型，却一个字都没听懂，一阵疑惑和犹豫之后，她第一次明白了她们之间没有交流的媒介。","Li Wan followed the shaping of the lips, but the words were unintelligible, and then, and for the first time, she realized, in a moment of suspense and indecision, that there was no medium of communication between them."
"她因为听不懂而焦急万分，用力张开双臂，喊了出来：“哦，女人，你是我的姐姐啊！”","And at the passion of her dumbness she cried out, with arms stretched wide apart, “O Woman, thou art sister of mine!”"
"她冲着她们大喊，泪水流过她的脸颊，她声音中的崩溃带着说不出的悲伤。可是吉丁斯小姐颤抖着，甚至是范·怀克夫人都有些受惊。","The tears coursed down her cheeks as she yearned toward them, and the break in her voice carried the sorrow she could not utter.But Miss Giddings was trembling, and even Mrs. Van Wyck was disturbed."
"“我想和你们一样生活。你们的路就是我的路，我们的路相同。我的丈夫是卡尼姆，一条独木舟，他高大而又奇怪，我害怕他。他要走遍全世界，永不停止，可是我很累。我妈妈和你一样，她的头发和眼睛也和你的一样。那时的生活很舒适，太阳也很暖和。”","“I would live as you live.Thy ways are my ways, and our ways be one.My husband is Canim, the Canoe, and he is big and strange, and I am afraid.His trail is all the world and never ends, and I am weary.My mother was like you, and her hair was as thine, and her eyes.And life was soft to me then, and the sun warm.”"
"她谦卑地跪下，把头低到范·怀克夫人的脚边。可是夫人为她的热情所惊，向后一退。","She knelt humbly, and bent her head at Mrs. Van Wyck’s feet.But Mrs. Van Wyck drew away, frightened at her vehemence."
"李婉站起来，想说话。她口齿不够伶俐，不能清楚地表达自己激动的情绪。","Li Wan stood up, panting for speech.Her dumb lips could not articulate her overmastering consciousness of kind."
"“生意？你是要和我做生意吗？”范·怀克夫人用一种居高临下的语气问道。","“Trade? you trade?”Mrs. Van Wyck questioned, slipping, after the fashion of the superior peoples, into pigeon tongue."
"她摸了摸李婉破烂的毛皮来表明自己想买什么，并把几百粒金子倒入了碗中。她来回搅动那金沙，金子泛着诱人的澄黄色光泽，从她的指尖流下。可是李婉只注意到她的手指，乳白色，线条优美，指头从指根到指尖逐渐变细，指甲是玫瑰色，如珠宝一般。她把自己那双长期操劳、长满老茧的手放到一边，大哭起来。","She touched Li Wan’s ragged skins to indicate her choice, and poured several hundreds of gold into the blower.She stirred the dust about and trickled its yellow lustre temptingly through her fingers.But Li Wan saw only the fingers, milk-white and shapely, tapering daintily to the rosy, jewel-like nails.She placed her own hand alongside, all work-worn and calloused, and wept."
"范·怀克夫人有些困惑。“金子，”她鼓励道，“上好的金子！你交易么？一个换另一个，怎么样？”她又把手放到了李婉的皮毛上。","Mrs. Van Wyck misunderstood.“Gold,” she encouraged.“Good gold!You trade?You changee for changee?”And she laid her hand again on Li Wan’s skin garments."
"“多少钱？你卖不？多少钱？”她坚持着，拿手逆着皮毛的方向摸索着，想找到筋线缝合的缝隙。","“How much?You sell?How much?” she persisted, running her hand against the way of the hair so that she might make sure of the sinew-thread seam."
"但是李婉还是不明白，那女人的话她一句也听不懂。失败的沮丧压制着她。她怎么才能让这两个女人认同自己呢？因为她知道她们同属一族，她们是血肉相连的姐妹，也都是男人的女人。她的眼睛急切地观察着室内，看到了挂着的软帷帐，女士服装，椭圆形的镜子，镜子下面还有讲究的洗漱用具。这些东西常常萦绕在她的脑海里，因为她以前见过这类的东西；当她看着它们的时候，她不自主地发出了颤抖的声音。接着一个念头闪过脑际，她镇定了下来。她必须平静下来。她必须控制住自己，因为这次绝不可以再有误会，或是其他——她甩掉压抑的泪水，再次让自己镇定下来。","But Li Wan was deaf as well, and the woman’s speech was without significance.Dismay at her failure sat upon her.How could she identify herself with these women?For she knew they were of the one breed, blood-sisters among men and the women of men.Her eyes roved wildly about the interior, taking in the soft draperies hanging around, the feminine garments, the oval mirror, and the dainty toilet accessories beneath.And the things haunted her, for she had seen like things before; and as she looked at them her lips involuntarily formed sounds which her throat trembled to utter.Then a thought flashed upon her, and she steadied herself.She must be calm.She must control herself, for there must be no misunderstanding this time, or else,—and she shook with a storm of suppressed tears and steadied herself again."
"她把手放在桌子上。“桌子，”她清晰明白地发出这个音，“桌子。”她重复了一下。","She put her hand on the table.“Table,” she clearly and distinctly enunciated.“Table,” she repeated."
"她看向范·怀克夫人，夫人赞许地点点头。李婉很高兴，但是告诫自己要忍住兴奋并保持镇定。“火炉，”她接着说，“火炉。”","She looked at Mrs. Van Wyck, who nodded approbation.Li Wan exulted, but brought her will to bear and held herself steady.“Stove” she went on.“Stove.”"
"范·怀克夫人每点一次头，李婉就会更加兴奋一些。那些忘记的词或快或慢地浮现在她脑海中，她时而吞吞吐吐，时而极度兴奋。她在木屋里四处走动，一件件地说出每个物品的名字。当她最终停下来的时候，她带着成功的喜悦站得笔直，头向后仰着，满心期待地等着。","And at every nod of Mrs. Van Wyck, Li Wan’s excitement mounted.Now stumbling and halting, and again in feverish haste, as the recrudescence of forgotten words was fast or slow, she moved about the cabin, naming article after article.And when she paused finally, it was in triumph, with body erect and head thrown back, expectant, waiting."
"“猫，”范·怀克夫人大笑着用幼儿园的方式一字一顿地说道，“我—看—见—猫—在—抓—老—鼠。”","“Cat,” Mrs. Van Wyck, laughing, spelled out in kindergarten fashion.“I—see—the—cat—catch—the—rat.”"
"李婉认真地点点头。她们终于开始理解她了，这些女人们。想到这一点，她古铜色的皮肤下隐隐有了一丝红晕。她微笑着，更加用力地点着头。","Li Wan nodded her head seriously.They were beginning to understand her at last, these women.The blood flushed darkly under her bronze at the thought, and she smiled and nodded her head still more vigorously."
"范·怀克夫人转向她的同伴，“我想她是在某个地方接受了一点差传教育，刚刚正好表现了一下。”","Mrs. Van Wyck turned to her companion.“Received a smattering of mission education somewhere, I fancy, and has come to show it off.”"
"“当然，”吉丁斯小姐嗤笑，“小傻瓜！她这么自大，咱们该睡不成觉了。”","“Of course,” Miss Giddings tittered.“Little fool!We shall lose our sleep with her vanity.”"
"“不管怎么样，我还是想要那件皮衣。即使旧了，做工还是不错的——是最棒的那种。”范·怀克夫人转向她的客人：“以物易物？你！以物易物！多少钱？嗯？多少钱，你出？”","“All the same I want that jacket.If it is old, the workmanship is good—a most excellent specimen.”She returned to her visitor.“Changee for changee?You!Changee for changee?How much?Eh?How much, you?”"
"“或许她想要条裙子什么的。”吉丁斯小姐建议道。","“Perhaps she’d prefer a dress or something,” Miss Giddings suggested."
"范·怀克夫人走向李婉，打着手势说她愿意用披肩来换夹克。为了推动这笔交易，她抓住李婉的手，把它放在隆起的胸前的蕾丝和丝带间，让它的手指在其间来回摩搓来感觉披肩的材质。可是缀满珠宝的蝴蝶结松松地固定在衣服上，系得不够紧，让袍子的前方滑到一边，露出了一只雪白、坚挺的乳房。还没有一个宝宝吮吸过它。","Mrs. Van Wyck went up to Li Wan and made signs that she would exchange her wrapper for the jacket.And to further the transaction, she took Li Wan’s hand and placed it amid the lace and ribbons of the flowing bosom, and rubbed the fingers back and forth so they might feel the texture.But the jewelled butterfly which loosely held the fold in place was insecurely fastened, and the front of the gown slipped to the side, exposing a firm white breast, which had never known the lip-clasp of a child."
"范·怀克夫人冷静地整理好衣服；可是李婉却大叫一声，对自己的皮衣又撕又扯，直到露出和对方一样雪白、挺立的胸脯。她口齿不清地嘟囔着，快速地打着手势，试图和对方攀上亲族关系。","Mrs. Van Wyck coolly repaired the mischief; but Li Wan uttered a loud cry, and ripped and tore at her skin-shirt till her own breast showed firm and white as Evelyn Van Wyck’s.Murmuring inarticulately and making swift signs, she strove to establish the kinship."
"“一个混血儿，”范·怀克夫人发表了她的意见，“从她的头发我就猜出来了。”","“A half-breed,” Mrs. Van Wyck commented.“I thought so from her hair.”"
"吉丁斯小姐做出一个挖苦的动作。“为她的白皮肤父亲而骄傲。太可恶了！伊夫琳，给她点教训，然后让她走。”","Miss Giddings made a fastidious gesture.“Proud of her father’s white skin.It’s beastly!Do give her something, Evelyn, and make her go.”"
"但是另一个女子叹了口气，“可怜的家伙，我希望能为她做点什么。”","But the other woman sighed.“Poor creature, I wish I could do something for her.”"
"一只脚重重地踏在门外的碎石上。接着木屋的门晃开了，卡尼姆走了进来。吉丁斯小姐仿佛看见有人暴毙一样，大叫起来；可范·怀克夫人却镇定地面对着他。","A heavy foot crunched the gravel without.Then the cabin door swung wide, and Canim stalked in.Miss Giddings saw a vision of sudden death, and screamed; but Mrs. Van Wyck faced him composedly."
"“你想干什么？”她问道。","“What do you want?” she demanded."
"“想干什么？”卡尼姆文雅又直接地答道，同时指向李婉。","“How do?”Canim answered suavely and directly, pointing at the same time to Li Wan."
"“嗯，我的妻子。”","“Um my wife.”"
"他伸手去抓她，可她却挥开他的手。","He reached out for her, but she waved him back."
"“说！卡尼姆！告诉她们我是——”","“Speak, Canim!Tell them that I am—”"
"“宝华芹的女儿？不，她们怎么会关心？我更应该告诉她们你是个坏妻子，因为你趁丈夫沉睡的时候从他的床边溜走了。”","“Daughter of Pow-Wah-Kaan?Nay, of what is it to them that they should care?Better should I tell them thou art an ill wife, given to creeping from thy husband’s bed when sleep is heavy in his eyes.”"
"他又伸手去抓她，她却躲到范·怀克夫人那里。李婉试图抓住她的膝盖，跪在她脚下疯狂地乞求。可那位太太退了几步，看着卡尼姆，示意他能把李婉抓回去。他抓住李婉的胳肢窝，让她站起来。她绝望而疯狂地和他抗争着，直到他累得大口喘气。他们缠斗的战场覆盖了大半个屋子。","Again he reached out for her, but she fled away from him to Mrs. Van Wyck, at whose feet she made frenzied appeal, and whose knees she tried to clasp.But the lady stepped back and gave permission with her eyes to Canim.He gripped Li Wan under the shoulders and raised her to her feet.She fought with him, in a madness of despair, till his chest was heaving with the exertion, and they had reeled about over half the room."
"“放开我吧，卡尼姆。”她哭泣着。","“Let me go, Canim,” she sobbed."
"可是他扭住她的手腕，直到她停止抗争。“关于小驼鹿鸟的记忆太深刻了，惹是生非。”他开口说。","But he twisted her wrist till she ceased to struggle.“The memories of the little moose-bird are overstrong and make trouble,” he began."
"“我知道！我知道！”她打断了他，“我看见雪地里那个人了，可不像以前，只能看见他匍匐在地。而我就是他背上的那个小孩。这是宝华芹和我开始住在那个小角落之前的事。”","“I know!I know!” she broke in.“I see the man in the snow, and as never before I see him crawl on hand and knee.And I, who am a little child, am carried on his back.And this is before Pow-Wah-Kaan and the time I came to live in a little corner of the earth.”"
"“你知道，”他用力把她顶在门上，回答说，“你会和我一起沿着育空河走下去，忘记一切。”","“You know,” he answered, forcing her toward the door; “but you will go with me down the Yukon and forget.”"
"“我永远不会忘记！只要我的皮肤是白的，我就不会忘记！”她疯狂地抓住门框，带着乞求，最后一次望向伊夫琳·范·怀克夫人。","“Never shall I forget!So long as my skin is white shall I remember!”She clutched frantically at the door-post and looked a last appeal to Mrs. Evelyn Van Wyck."
"“那我会教你如何忘记，我，卡尼姆，那只独木舟！”","“Then will I teach thee to forget, I, Canim, the Canoe!”"
"说着，他拉开她的手，带着她踏上了旅途。","As he spoke he pulled her fingers clear and passed out with her upon the trail."
