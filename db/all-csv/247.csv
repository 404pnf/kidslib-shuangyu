"母与女","MOTHER AND DAUGHTER"
"作者：D. H. 劳伦斯","by D. H. Lawrence "
"弗吉尼娅·博多恩有一份好工作：她是某个政府部门的部门负责人，并且，如同巴尔扎克那样确切地说，她每年能挣七百五十英镑。","Virginia Bodoin had a good job: she was head of a department in a certain government office, held a responsible position, and earned, to imitate Balzac and be precise about it, seven hundred and fifty pounds a year."
"那已经够可观了。","That is already something."
"她的母亲雷切尔·博多恩，年收入则在六百英镑左右，自从那个从来都不是很重要的丈夫消失之后，她母亲就一直依靠这笔收入在欧洲各大城市轮流居住。","Rachel Bodoin, her mother, had an income of about six hundred a year, on which she had lived in the capitals of Europe since the effacement of a never very important husband."
"如今，经过几乎是完全分离和“自由”的几年之后，母女二人再次考虑安顿下来。","Now, after some years of virtual separation and “freedom”, mother and daughter once more thought of settling down."
"这些年之后，她们两人已经变得更像一对夫妇而不像母女了。","They had become, in course of time, more like a married couple than mother and daughter."
"她们的确非常了解彼此，而且各自对对方都有些“神经质”。","They knew one another very well indeed, and each was a little “nervous” of the other."
"她们时聚时散，已有好几次了。","They had lived together and parted several times."
"弗吉尼娅如今三十岁了，可是看不出她有结婚的打算。","Virginia was now thirty, and she didn’t look like marrying."
"四年来，她和亨利·卢伯克，一个喜爱音乐却被娇纵坏了的年轻人，好得如同结了婚一般。","For four years she had been as good as married to Henry Lubbock, a rather spoilt young man who was musical."
"后来，亨利让她失望了：有两个原因。","Then Henry let her down: for two reasons."
"一是他不能容忍她的母亲。","He couldn’t stand her mother."
"而她母亲也不能容忍他。","Her mother couldn’t stand him."
"另外，凡是博多恩太太不能容忍的人，她就会想方设法欺压人家，让人变得悲惨不已。","And anybody whom Mrs Bodoin could not stand she managed to sit on, disastrously."
"亨利遭到岳母的百般压制，感到十分苦恼。而弗吉尼娅呢，终究还是无可奈何地忠于自己的家族，站在了她母亲这一边。","So Henry had writhed horribly, feeling his mother-in-law sitting on him tight, and Virginia, after all, in a helpless sort of family loyalty, sitting alongside her mother."
"弗吉尼娅并不是真的想欺压亨利。","Virginia didn’t really want to sit on Henry."
"可是当她母亲教唆她时，她便没了主意。","But when her mother egged her on, she couldn’t help it."
"因为，归根结底她的母亲支配着她，那是一种神秘的女性力量，与父母的权威没有丝毫关系。","For ultimately, her mother had power over her; a strange female power, nothing to do with parental authority."
"弗吉尼娅早就把父母的权威抛到脑后了。","Virginia had long thrown parental authority to the winds."
"然而，她的母亲拥有另一种更为微妙的支配形式，柔弱却令人毛骨悚然，因此当雷切尔说：让我们制服他吧！","But her mother had another, much subtler form of domination, female and thrilling, so that when Rachel said: Let’s squash him!"
"弗吉尼娅便不得不恶狠狠地、欢欣鼓舞地赶忙加入到这场游戏当中。","Virginia had to rush wickedly and gleefully to the sport."
"而每逢亨利遭到排挤时，他都心知肚明。","And Henry knew quite well when he was being squashed."
"所以，那就是他背弃文尼的原因之一。他称她文尼，博多恩太太对此极为反感，总是纠正他说：“我女儿叫弗吉尼娅——”","So that was one of his reasons for going back on Vinny.—He called her Vinny, to the superlative disgust of Mrs Bodoin, who always corrected him: My daughter Virginia—"
"第二个原因，还是借用巴尔扎克的话说，弗吉尼娅那时是一文不名。","The second reason was, again to be Balzacian, that Virginia hadn’t a sou of her own."
"亨利只有可怜的二百五十英镑。","Henry had a sorry two hundred and fifty."
"弗吉尼娅呢，在二十四岁的时候，就已经能挣四百五十英镑了。","Virginia, at the age of twenty-four, was already earning four hundred and fifty."
"不过，那可是她挣的。","But she was earning them."
"而亨利靠着他那珍爱的音乐，每年才只能挣大约十二英镑。","Whereas Henry managed to earn about twelve pounds per annum, by his precious music."
"他意识到自己很难再挣得更多。","He had realized that he would find it hard to earn more."
"所以，除非娶一位能养他的妻子，否则，结婚便毫无可能。","So that marrying, except with a wife who could keep him, was rather out of the question."
"文尼会继承她母亲的财产。","Vinny would inherit her mother’s money."
"然而，博多恩太太拥有斯芬克斯那样的强健体魄和肌肉组织。","But then Mrs Bodoin had the health and muscular equipment of the Sphinx."
"她会一直活下去，寻觅她可以吞噬的男人，然后吞噬他。","She would live forever, seeking whom she might devour, and devouring him."
"亨利与文尼像夫妻一样，共同生活了两年：而且文尼感觉到他们确实结婚了，只差一个仪式罢了。","Henry lived with Vinny for two years, in the married sense of the words: and Vinny felt they were married, minus a mere ceremony."
"不过，文尼总是有她母亲作后盾，尽管母亲经常远在巴黎或比亚里茨，但仍然有信件往来。","But Vinny had her mother always in the background; often as far back as Paris or Biarritz, but still, within letter reach."
"母亲甚至在信中也会展开自己的裙子，镇定地打压亨利，而她从未意识到就在那时她淘气的脸上会露出会心的微笑。","And she never realized the funny little grin that came on her own elvish face when her mother, even in a letter, spread her skirts and calmly sat on Henry."
"她从没有意识到，在精神上，她也已经迅速又顽皮地挤兑了他：她不能控制自己的行为，就如同潮汐涨落不能摆脱月亮的影响一样。","She never realized that in spirit she promptly and mischievously sat on him too: she could no more have helped it than the tide can help turning to the moon."
"她连做梦都没想过他感受到了这一切，而且他那男性的虚荣心受到了极大的羞辱。","And she did not dream that he felt it, and was utterly mortified in his masculine vanity."
"女人们通常是互相迷恋，着了迷之后，进而温柔地搂住她们认为自己全心全意爱着的男人的脖子。","Women, very often, hypnotize one another, and then, hypnotized, they proceed gently to wring the neck of the man they think they are loving with all their hearts."
"若是那个男人不喜欢自己的脖子被搂住，她们便称之为彻底反常。","Then they call it utter perversity on his part, that he doesn’t like having his neck wrung."
"她们认为他这是在拒绝一份真心真意的爱情。","They think he is repudiating a heart-felt love."
"因为她们心醉魂迷了。","For they are hypnotized."
"女人便这么不知不觉地相互迷恋着。","Women hypnotize one another, without knowing it."
"最终，亨利退出了。","In the end, Henry backed out."
"他发现自己被这两个女人贬得一无是处，一个是有着斯芬克斯那样肌肉的老女巫，另一个是着了魔的年轻女巫，她挥霍无度、古灵精怪而软弱无用，她极力地宠着他，却吞噬了他的精髓。","He saw himself being simply reduced to nothingness by two women, an old witch with muscles like the Sphinx, and a young, spell-bound witch, lavish, elvish and weak, who utterly spoilt him but who ate his marrow."
"雷切尔会从巴黎写信来说：我亲爱的弗吉尼娅，由于我在投资方面发了一笔横财，所以我要和你一起分享。","Rachel would write from Paris: My dear Virginia, as I had a windfall in the way of an investment, I am sharing it with you."
"随信附上一张二十英镑的支票。","You will find enclosed my cheque for twenty pounds."
"你肯定会需要这笔钱给亨利买一套西服的，因为眼看春天就要到了，阳光很可能会把他的穷酸相都暴露出来的。","No doubt you will be needing it to buy Henry a suit of clothes, since the spring is apparently come, and the sunlight may be tempted to show him up for what he is worth."
"我可不想我的女儿和一个像是街头乐手的人到处走动，不过得你自己付裁缝的手工钱，要不然以后还得你再付。——亨利得了一套西装，可那几乎就是一件“内萨斯之衣”，用稀薄的毒液吞噬着他。","I don’t want my daughter going around with what is presumably a street-corner musician, but please pay the tailor’s bill yourself, or you may have to do it over again later.—Henry got a suit of clothes, but it was as good as a shirt of Nessus, eating him away with subtle poison."
"因此他退出了。","So he backed out."
"他不是在双方剑拔弩张的时候猛然离开、突然溜走，或是夺路而逃。","He didn’t jump out, or bolt, or carve his way out at the sword’s point."
"他应该算是逐渐淡出的，若即若离有一年多才彻底离开的。","He sort of faded out, distributing his departure over a year or more."
"他喜欢文尼，简直离不开她，他也对她感到歉疚。","He was fond of Vinny, and he could hardly do without her, and he was sorry for her."
"但最终他看出她不能离开她母亲。","But at length he couldn’t see her apart from her mother."
"她是个年轻、软弱、爱挥霍浪费的女巫，是她那个手段强硬、巫婆般母亲的帮凶。","She was a young, weak, spendthrift witch, accomplice of her tough-clawed witch of a mother."
"亨利与其他人确定了关系，在别处找到了立足之地，从而渐渐地解救了自己。","Henry made other alliances, got a good hold on elsewhere, and gradually extricated himself."
"他拯救了自己的生命，可是他感到,自己浪费了许多青春和精力。","He saved his life, but he had lost, he felt, a good deal of his youth and marrow."
"现在他开始发胖，变得有点儿臃肿，有点儿不起眼了。","He tended now to go fat, a little puffy, somewhat insignificant."
"可他曾经帅气英俊、引人注目。","And he had been handsome and striking-looking."
"当他离开这两个女巫师时，她们大声嚎叫了起来。","The two witches howled when he was lost to them."
"可怜的弗吉尼娅真的半疯半癫了，她不知道如何是好。","Poor Virginia was really half crazy, she didn’t know what to do with herself."
"她对母亲怀着一种强烈的抵触情绪。","She had a violent recoil from her mother."
"而博多恩太太对女儿充满了强烈的鄙视：她竟然让这样一条上了钩的鱼从她手里溜掉了！她竟然让这样的一个人把她给抛弃了！——“我真搞不懂我的女儿是怎么被亨利·卢伯克这样的寄生虫引诱然后抛弃的！”她写道，","Mrs Bodoin was filled with furious contempt for her daughter: that she should let such a hooked fish slip out of her hands! that she should allow such a person to turn her down!—“I don’t quite see my daughter seduced and thrown over by a sponging individual such as Henry Lubbock,” she wrote."
"“可是既然事情已经发生了，我想这就是某个人的过错——”","“But if it has happened, I suppose it is somebody’s fault—”"
"母女间的相互抵触持续了将近五年。","There was a mutual recoil, which lasted nearly five years."
"可是那种魔力并未消散。","But the spell was not broken."
"博多恩太太的心思从来没离开过女儿，而弗吉尼娅也总是意识到她的母亲就在宇宙中的某个地方。","Mrs Bodoin’s mind never left her daughter, and Virginia was ceaselessly aware of her mother, somewhere in the universe."
"她们互通书信，时不时地也见见面，可是她们在逃避中保持着距离。","They wrote, and met at intervals, but they kept apart in recoil."
"然而，这种魔力仍旧存在于她们之间，并渐渐地产生了作用。","The spell, however, was between them, and gradually it worked."
"她们感到更亲近些了。","They felt more friendly."
"博多恩太太来到了伦敦。","Mrs Bodoin came to London."
"她和女儿住在同一家清静的旅馆里：过去三年来，弗吉尼娅在旅馆里一直租着两个房间。","She stayed in the same quiet hotel with her daughter: Virginia had had two rooms in a hotel for the past three years."
"最终，她们想要一起租一套寓所。","And, at last, they thought of taking an apartment together."
"弗吉尼娅如今三十多了。","Virginia was now over thirty."
"她仍旧瘦弱、古怪而淘气，她的一只棕色的眼睛中略微投射出逗人喜爱的目光，脸上依旧露出古怪而扭曲的微笑，舒缓而低沉的声音如同细俏指尖般抚摸着男人。","She was still thin and odd and elvish, with a very slight and piquant cast in one of her brown eyes, and she still had her odd, twisted smile, and her slow, rather deep-toned voice, that caressed a man like the stroking of subtle finger-tips."
"她依旧是一头自然卷发，略微有些凌乱。","Her hair was still a natural tangle of curls, a bit dishevelled."
"她仍旧衣着自然典雅，只是显得有些别扭，看上去有点邋遢。","She still dressed with a natural elegance which tended to go wrong and a tiny bit sluttish."
"她那昂贵全新的长筒袜上仍旧会有个破洞，而她一到客厅喝茶，依旧会脱掉鞋子，穿着长筒袜坐在那里。","She still might have a hole in her expensive and perfectly new stockings, and still she might have to take off her shoes in the drawing-room, if she came to tea, and sit there in her stockinged-feet."
"不错，她有双漂亮的脚：她整个人都优雅标致。","True, she had elegant feet: she was altogether elegantly shaped."
"可是这不能说明什么。","But it wasn’t that."
"那既不是卖弄风骚也不是虚荣做作。","It was neither coquetry nor vanity."
"原因很简单，她曾找了一位手艺精湛的鞋匠，花了五个几尼定做了一双非常简朴、自然、合脚的鞋，可是当她穿着这双鞋走上半英里，鞋就夹得她异常难受，她就只能脱下这鞋，甚至是坐在路边镶边石上也要脱掉它。","It was simply that, after having gone to a good shoemaker and paid five guineas for a pair of perfectly simple and natural shoes, made to her feet, the said shoes would hurt her excruciatingly, when she had walked half a mile in them, and she would simply have to take them off, even if she sat on the kerb to do it."
"这就是命中注定的事。","It was a fatality."
"她的双脚有点顽皮、有些懒惰，绝不愿规规矩矩地呆在漂亮顺脚的鞋中。","There was a touch of the gamin in her very feet, a certain sluttishness that wouldn’t let them stay properly in nice proper shoes."
"事实上，她总是穿她母亲的旧鞋。——当然我自始至终都是穿母亲的旧鞋。","She practically always wore her mother’s old shoes.—Of course I go through life in mother’s old shoes."
"如果她死了，离开了我，因而不再有旧鞋供我穿的话，我想我只能坐着轮椅行走了，她咧着嘴，怪模怪样地笑着说。","If she died and left me without a supply, I suppose I should have to go in a bathchair, she would say, with her odd twisted little grin."
"她是如此优雅漂亮，却是个荡妇。","She was so elegant, and yet a slut."
"这就是她的魅力所在，真的。","It was her charm, really."
"这正好与她母亲相反。她们可以换着穿对方的鞋子和衣服，这似乎有点不可思议，因为博多恩太太看上去比女儿高大多了。","Just the opposite of her mother.They could wear each other’s shoes and each other’s clothes, which seemed remarkable, for Mrs Bodoin seemed so much the bigger of the two."
"不过弗吉尼娅的肩很宽，她虽然偏瘦，但身躯高大，即使当她看上去弱不禁风、衣衫褴褛的时候也是如此。","But Virginia’s shoulders were broad, if she was thin, she had a strong frame, even when she looked a frail rag."
"博多恩太太是那种六十岁左右的女人之一，身上充满了一种令人生畏的内在能量和某种强大的活力。","Mrs Bodoin was one of those women of sixty or so, with a terrible inward energy and a violent sort of vitality."
"不过她成功地掩饰了这一点。","But she managed to hide it."
"她坐着的时候双手叉握，神态极为镇定。","She sat with perfect repose, and folded hands."
"人们会想：这真是一个沉着的妇人啊！","One thought: What a calm woman!"
"正如同在夜光下，人们看着一座沉默火山那白雪皑皑的顶峰，会想：多么平静啊！","Just as one may look at the snowy summit of a quiescent volcano, in the evening light, and think: What peace!"
"有一种奇特的强大能量控制着博多恩太太，让人感到好奇的是，许多超过五十岁的女人都受这种能量的控制，并且其表现形式通常都令人反感。","It was a strange muscular energy which possessed Mrs Bodoin, as it possesses, curiously enough, many women over fifty, and is usually distasteful in its manifestations."
"也许这可以用来解释为什么年轻人无精打采。","Perhaps it accounts for the lassitude of the young."
"不过博多恩太太意识到了她那些精力充沛的同龄人趣味低级，所以她培养出沉着的性情。","But Mrs Bodoin recognized the bad taste in her energetic coevals, so she cultivated repose."
"沉——着，她说出这个两个音节的词时，能把第二个音节读得直冲云霄，这表露出她有太多太多被压抑的能量了。","Her very way of pronouncing the word, in two syllables: re-pose, making the second syllable run on into the twilight, showed how much suppressed energy she had."
"面对着铁灰色头发和黑眉毛的问题，她极其聪明，决不去尝试靠染色让自己回复青春。","Faced with the problem of iron-grey hair and black eyebrows, she was too clever to try dyeing herself back into youth."
"她仔细端详着自己那张脸，整个身材，然后作出乐观的判断。","She studied her face, her whole figure, and decided that it was positive."
"这是无可挑剔的。","There was no denying it."
"没有纤弱的体态，没有凹陷的双颊，没有弱不禁风凋花残枝之相。","There was no wispiness, no hollowness, no limp frail blossom-on-a-bending-stalk about her."
"她的身材，丰腴强壮，曲线优雅，但不显胖。","Her figure, though not stout, was full, strong, and cambré."
"她脸上有着一只贵族式的拱形鼻子，一双高贵又不可一世的灰色眼眸，脸颊颇长但很丰满。","Her face had an aristocratic arched nose, aristocratic, who-the-devil-are-you grey eyes, and cheeks rather long but also rather full."
"这模样虽说不上令人神魂颠倒，也绝无年轻人的轻佻。","Nothing appealing or youthfully skittish here."
"像任何一个独立的女人一样，她善用智慧，非常坚定地决心不让自己显得年少轻佻或是妩媚动人。","Like an independent woman, she used her wits, and decided most emphatically not to be either youthful or skittish or appealing."
"她保持着自己的尊严，因为她喜爱这样。","She would keep her dignity, for she was fond of it."
"她很积极。","She was positive."
"她喜欢积极的状态。","She liked to be positive."
"她已习惯了自己的积极。","She was used to her positivity."
"所以她会这样积极下去。","So she would just be positive."
"她偏向于十八世纪那个实证主义时代，求教于伏尔泰、尼农·德·朗克洛和蓬帕杜尔，求教于公爵夫人和侯爵先生。","She turned to the positive period; to the eighteenth century, to Voltaire, to Ninon de l’Enclos and the Pompadour, to Madame la Duchesse and Monsieur le Marquis."
"她断定自己与蓬帕杜尔夫人或公爵夫人不太相像，不过几乎完全与伯爵先生是同一类人。","She decided that she was not much in the line of la Pompadour or la Duchesse, but almost exactly in the line of Monsieur le Marquis."
"她是对的。","And she was right."
"她银白色的头发干净利索地向后梳去，露出自信的眉毛和鬓角，头发剪得很短，略微向后伸展，加上她那张相当丰满的粉红面庞和拉成两道细细弦月形的黑色眉毛，配上她那只拱形的鼻子和那双饱满傲慢的眼睛，使她全然成了一位十八世纪上半叶的人了。","With hair silvering to white, brushed back clean from her positive brow and temples, cut short, but sticking out a little behind, with her rather full, pink face and thin black eyebrows plucked to two fine, superficial crescents, her arching nose and her rather full insolent eyes she was perfectly eighteenth-century, the early half."
"她这种更像侯爵先生而非侯爵夫人的气派使她显得十分摩登。","That she was Monsieur le Marquis rather than Madame la Marquise made her really modern."
"她的外表是完美的。","Her appearance was perfect."
"她的衣服颜色是灰色和粉色优雅地搭配在一起，也许还稍带点深铁灰色，她佩戴的首饰是颜色柔和古典的人造宝石。","She wore delicate combinations of grey and pink, maybe with a darkening iron-grey touch, and her jewels were of soft old coloured paste."
"她的举止恬静，同时透着警觉，非常镇定，但又极其自信。","Her bearing was a sort of alert repose, very calm, but very assured."
"用一句俗话说，没有她跨不过的槛儿。","There was, to use a vulgarism, no getting past her."
"她手头有几千英镑。","She had a couple of thousand pounds she could lay hands on."
"而弗吉尼娅呢，自然地，总是欠债累累。","Virginia, of course, was always in debt."
"可终归也不能对弗吉尼娅嗤之以鼻。","But, after all, Virginia was not to be sniffed at."
"她每年能挣七百五十英镑呢。","She made seven hundred and fifty a year."
"弗吉尼娅异常聪明，可不怎么精明。","Virginia was oddly clever, and not clever."
"她并非真的无所不知，因为凡是她当时感兴趣的东西，她都能马上学会它。","She didn’t really know anything, because anything and everything was interesting to her for the moment, and she picked it up at once."
"她学起语言来格外轻松，不出两个星期她就能说得很流利。","She picked up languages with extraordinary ease, she was fluent in a fortnight."
"这对她的工作有很大的帮助。","This helped her enormously with her job."
"她可以和行业领导们东拉西扯，不管他们来自哪里。","She could prattle away with heads of industry, let them come from where they liked."
"可她却不了解任何语言，甚至包括她自己的母语。","But she didn’t know any language, not even her own."
"打个比方说，她能在梦中学东西，而对它们毫不理解。","She picked things up in her sleep, so to speak, without knowing anything about them."
"这使她受到男人们的青睐。","And this made her popular with men."
"尽管她具备这种奇特的学习能力，可男人们在她面前并不感到无地自容，因为她好似一架机器。","With all her curious facility, they didn’t feel small in front of her, because she was like an instrument."
"她需要受到激发。","She had to be prompted."
"得有男人先启动她，然后她才能真正灵巧地运转起来。","Some man had to set her in motion, and then she worked, really cleverly."
"她能收集到最有价值的资料。","She could collect the most valuable information."
"她这样的人很有用。","She was very useful."
"她同男人们一起工作，大部分时间都和男人们在一起，她的朋友差不多都是男的。","She worked with men, spent most of her time with men, her friends were practically all men."
"她和女人相处时感觉不自在。","She didn’t feel easy with women."
"然而她没有情人，好像没有人渴望娶她，好像根本没有人急于想接近她。","Yet she had no lover, nobody seemed eager to marry her, nobody seemed eager to come close to her at all."
"博多恩太太说：恐怕弗吉尼娅是个只有一个男人的女人。","Mrs Bodoin said: I’m afraid Virginia is a one-man woman."
"我就是只有一个男人的女人。","I am a one-man woman."
"我母亲也是，我的外祖母也是。","So was my mother, and so was my grandmother."
"弗吉尼娅的爸爸是我人生中仅有的男人，仅有的一个。","Virginia’s father was the only man in my life, the only one."
"恐怕弗吉尼娅也是这样，这样固执。","And I’m afraid Virginia is the same, tenacious."
"倒霉的是，她的这个男人就是这种人，她这一生也只能停留于此了。","Unfortunately, the man was what he was, and her life is just left there."
"而亨利从前说过，博多恩太太绝非只有一个男人的女人，她是个没有男人的女人，如果她能得逞的话，所有雄性的东西都将会从地球上一扫而光，仅留下雌性的东西。","Henry had said, in the past, that Mrs Bodoin wasn’t a one-man woman, she was a no-man woman, and that if she could have had her way, everything male would have been wiped off the face of the earth, and only the female element left."
"不管怎样，博多恩太太认为现在是该搬家的时候了。","However, Mrs Bodoin thought that it was now time to make a move."
"于是，她和弗吉尼娅在古老的布鲁姆斯堡广场附近的一个街区挑选了一套很漂亮的公寓，精心装修一番，配上家具和一些十分可爱的东西，雇来一个很不错的奥地利男人做饭，然后，母女二人便一起开始了婚姻生活。","So she and Virginia took a quite handsome apartment in one of the old Bloomsbury Squares, fitted it up and furnished it with extreme care, and with some quite lovely things, got in a very good man, an Austrian, to cook, and they set up married life together, mother and daughter."
"一开始，这种生活是非常令人兴奋的。","At first it was rather thrilling."
"两间客厅极为宽敞，俯视着广场花园中脏兮兮的老树，并且每一间都有三扇大窗户，窗户开得很低，差不多低至膝盖的高度。","The two reception-rooms, looking down on the dirty old trees of the square garden, were of splendid proportions, and each with three great windows coming down low, almost to the level of the knees."
"壁炉架是十八世纪晚期的风格。","The chimney-piece was late eighteenth-century."
"博多恩太太布置的房间略微受路易十六时代风格的启发并融合了法兰西第一帝国时代的风格，但也没有固守任何特定的风格。","Mrs Bodoin furnished the rooms with a gentle suggestion of Louis Seize merged with Empire, without keeping to any particular style."
"不过，她有一块从她自己家里保留下来的、委实与众不同的欧比松地毯。","But she had, saved from her own home, a really remarkable Aubusson carpet."
"它看上去几乎是新的，就像两年前才织成的一样，这着实令人惊叹，当它在地板上展开时，那玫瑰色的滚边，镶在那绚丽绝伦毯面上的银灰色和金灰色的玫瑰花、百合花、华丽的天鹅和喇叭状的螺环，不知为何都颇为奢华艳丽。","It looked almost new, as if it had been woven two years ago, and was startling, yet somehow rather splendid, as it spread its rose-red borders and wonderful florid array of silver-grey and gold-grey roses, lilies and gorgeous swans and trumpeting volutes away over the floor."
"极具审美眼光的人会觉得它过于刺眼花哨，他们更喜欢大卧室里的那张发旧的色彩暗淡微黄的欧比松地毯。","Very aesthetic people found it rather loud, they preferred the worn, dim yellowish Aubusson in the big bedroom."
"可是博多恩太太就喜欢她客厅里的地毯。","But Mrs Bodoin loved her drawing-room carpet."
"它色彩明快却不俗气。","It was positive, but it was not vulgar."
"它那绚丽华美中透露着某种大气。","It had a certain grand air in its floridity."
"她感觉它给予她一种脚踏实地之感。","She felt it gave her a proper footing."
"而且，它与她那色彩鲜明的橱柜，金灰色凸花的锦缎椅子和中国大花瓶十分匹配，她喜欢在这些大花瓶里插上一些名花：独一无二的中国牡丹，大朵的玫瑰，细长的郁金香，橙色的百合。","And it behaved very well with her painted cabinets and grey-and-gold brocade chairs and big Chinese vases, which she liked to fill with big flowers: single Chinese peonies, big roses, great tulips, orange lilies."
"这间伦敦昏暗的房间，带着它那独具美感的色调，迎着这些大朵的、自由绽放、争奇斗艳的鲜花。","The dim room of London, with all its atmospheric colour, would stand the big, free, fisticuffing flowers."
"而弗吉尼娅在她一生中第一次感受到了安家的喜悦。","Virginia, for the first time in her life, had the pleasure of making a home."
"她再一次完全受控于母亲的魔力之下，神魂颠倒，身心俱醉。","She was again entirely under her mother’s spell, and swept away, thrilled to her marrow."
"她从未想到母亲竟背地里藏有这等宝贝，如地毯、色调鲜明的橱柜和凸花锦缎椅子：这里面有许多是爱尔兰菲茨帕特里克家的余物，博多恩太太是菲茨帕特里克家族的一员。","She had had no idea that her mother had got such treasures as the carpets and painted cabinets and brocade chairs up her sleeve: many of them the débris of the Fitzpatrick home in Ireland, Mrs Bodoin being a Fitzpatrick."
"弗吉尼娅几乎像个孩子、像个新娘似的投身于装扮房间的事务中。","Almost like a child, like a bride, Virginia threw herself into the business of fixing up the rooms."
"“当然，弗吉尼娅，我把这儿看作是你的公寓。”博多恩太太说，","“Of course, Virginia, I consider this is your apartment,” said Mrs Bodoin."
"“我只不过是陪伴你的老太太，你有什么吩咐就说出来，我完全会照办。”","“I am nothing but your dame de compagnie, and shall carry out your wishes entirely, if you will only express them.”"
"当然，弗吉尼娅会提些要求的，但不多。","Of course Virginia expressed a few, but not many."
"她挂上了一些风格狂放的画作，那是从她资助的一些穷艺术家那里买来的。","She introduced some wild pictures bought from impecunious artists whom she patronized."
"博多恩太太认为这些画作明确地表达了错误的东西，不过她还是尽可能地留着它们：权且把它们看作是现代的丑陋之中必不可少的组成元素吧。","Mrs Bodoin thought the pictures positive about the wrong things, but as far as possible, she let them stay: looking on them as the necessary element of modern ugliness."
"可是，透过这些故意表现出来的现代丑陋的元素，就很容易看出弗吉尼娅给这间公寓增添的都是些什么样的东西了。","But by that element of modern ugliness, wilfully so, it was easy to see the things that Virginia had introduced into the apartment."
"也许没有什么事能像装饰房子一样令人振奋了。","Perhaps nothing goes to the head like setting up house."
"你会陶醉其中。","You can get drunk on it."
"你会感到你在创造某种东西。","You feel you are creating something."
"如今，它不再是“家”，一个安乐窝了。","Nowadays it is no longer the “home”, the domestic nest."
"它成了“我的房间”，或是“我的房子”，成了展现和掩饰“我的性格”的大外套。","It is “my rooms”, or “my house”, the great garment which reveals and clothes “my personality”."
"博多恩太太是慎重周到地为弗吉尼娅策划，因而对此保持着适度的冷静，可就是她也是从骨子里感到兴奋，对待室内设计师和家具商时那副紧张、凶恶的神情，真令人吃惊。","Mrs Bodoin, deliberately scheming for Virginia, kept moderately cool over it, but even she was thrilled to the marrow, and of an intensity and ferocity with the decorators and furnishers, astonishing."
"而弗吉尼娅则自始自终对此情有独钟，仿佛是伴随着一声芝麻开门，她已经触碰到了生命灰墙上的某个神秘开关。","But Virginia was just all the time tipsy with it, as if she had touched some magic button on the grey wall of life, and with an Open Sesame!"
"她可爱而绚丽的房间便开始从仙境中显现出来。对她而言，这比她继承一处公爵领地显得更加生动和奇妙。","her lovely and coloured rooms had begun to assemble out of fairyland.It was far more vivid and wonderful to her than if she had inherited a duchy."
"此后母女二人便开始宴请宾客，母亲身着有点褪色的赤褐色衣服，而女儿则一身银色打扮。","The mother and daughter, the mother in a sort of faded russet crimson and the daughter in silver, began to entertain."
"当然，她们宴请的多半是男人。","They had, of course, mostly men."
"招待女人让博多恩太太心里充满一种强烈的不耐烦之感。","It filled Mrs Bodoin with a sort of savage impatience to entertain women."
"况且弗吉尼娅的熟人也大部分是男人。","Besides, most of Virginia’s acquaintances were men."
"于是，家中便会举行晚宴和精心准备的晚会。","So there were dinners and well-arranged evenings."
"一切都进展顺利，可总缺少点什么。","It went well, but something was missing."
"博多恩太太想表现得优雅些，因此变得颇为矜持。","Mrs Bodoin wanted to be gracious, so she held herself rather back."
"她对人略微保持着距离，镇定沉静、神色自若，很有点十八世纪的味道，她决心要给聪明且有些顽皮的弗吉尼娅作陪衬。","She stayed a little distant, was calm, reposed, eighteenth-century, and determined to be a foil to the clever and slightly-elvish Virginia."
"这只是装模做样，而且，哎，这阻碍了某些事情的发生。","It was a pose, and alas, it stopped something."
"不论她多么瞧不起那些男人，她都对他们和蔼可亲。","She was very nice with the men, no matter what her contempt of them."
"但是这些男人同她在一起却心神不安：他们怕她。","But the men were uneasy with her: afraid."
"所有的那些男宾客，他们所感受到的就是，对他们来说实际上什么事也没发生。","What they all felt, all the men guests, was that for them, nothing really happened."
"所发生的一切不过是在她们母女二人之间。","Everything that happened was between mother and daughter."
"所有情感的流露全在母女二人之间。","All the flow was between mother and daughter."
"某种神秘的、具有催眠作用的魔力环绕着这两个女人，无论那些男人们怎样努力，他们还是被排斥在外了。","A subtle, hypnotic spell encompassed the two women, and try as they might, the men were shut out."
"不止有一个年轻男人，有些神魂颠倒了，开始钟情于弗吉尼娅。","More than one young man, a little dazzled, began to fall in love with Virginia."
"但这是不可能的事。","But it was impossible."
"他不但被排斥在外，而且在某种程度上被摧毁了。","Not only was he shut out, he was, in some way, annihilated."
"这种自发的爱情被抹杀在了他的内心深处。","The spontaneity was killed in his bosom."
"这两个聪颖而极其漂亮的女人坐在桌子两端，仿佛二人之间存在磁场感应，她们好似两个女巫，好似两个不是把男人变成猪猡而是将他们变成笨蛋的赛丝——男人们本是非常愿意被变成猪猡的。","While the two women sat, brilliant and rather wonderful, in magnetic connection at opposite ends of the table, like two witches, a double Circe turning the men not into swine—the men would have liked that well enough—but into lumps."
"这真是可悲。","It was tragic."
"因为博多恩太太想要弗吉尼娅去恋爱结婚。她真的希望这样，并且还把弗吉尼娅缺少追随者归因于亨利的过错。","Because Mrs Bodoin wanted Virginia to fall in love and marry.She really wanted it, and she attributed Virginia’s lack of forthcoming to the delinquent Henry."
"她从没意识到那股环绕着她、也环绕着弗吉尼娅的催眠性魔力，这种魔力使男人根本无法接近这两个女人，母女二人都是如此。","She never realized the hypnotic spell, which of course encompassed her as well as Virginia, and made men just an impossibility to both women, mother and daughter alike."
"这一次，博多恩太太藏起了自己的幽默。","At this time, Mrs Bodoin hid her humour."
"她确实拥有不可思议的幽默模仿才能。","She had a really marvellous faculty of humorous imitation."
"她能模仿从她老家来的爱尔兰仆人，或拜访她的美国妇人们，或那些摩登娘娘腔的年轻男人，她称这些年轻男人为“日光兰”：“你肯定知道日光兰是一种洋葱！","She could imitate the Irish servants from her old home, or the American women who called on her, or the modern lady-like young men, the asphodels, as she called them: “Of course you know the asphodel is a kind of onion!"
"噢，是的，只不过是一种养尊处优的洋葱。”他们小声嘀咕着，挤眉弄眼地窥视着，想让她感到自己极其渺小和庸俗。","Oh yes, just an over-bred onion”: who wanted, with their murmuring voices and peeping under their brows, to make her feel very small and very bourgeois."
"她能够幽默地模仿他们所有人，那份幽默还果真带着些许天赋。","She could imitate them all with a humour that was really touched with genius."
"可这是毁灭性的。","But it was devastating."
"它完全摧毁了她幽默的对象，用无情的锤子把他们砸成碎片，又可怕地把他们打得粉碎，这使人惊恐，特别是男人。","It demolished the objects of her humour so absolutely, smashed them to bits with a ruthless hammer, pounded them to nothing so terribly, that it frightened people, particularly men."
"它把男人们吓跑了。","It frightened men off."
"所以她把它隐藏起来了。","So she hid it."
"她把它掩盖住了。","She hid it."
"不过她那冷酷无情、如同重锤似的幽默就躲在暗处，刚刚已经狠狠地击打了它嘲讽对象的脑瓜，致使他头破血流。","But there it was, up her sleeve, her merciless, hammer-like humour, which just smashed its object on the head and left him brained."
"她试图否认拥有这种幽默。","She tried to disown it."
"她甚至在弗吉尼娅面前也试图装作她不再拥有这种天分了。","She tried to pretend, even to Virginia, that she had the gift no more."
"可这是白费力气，她藏起来的重锤悬在每一位宾客的头上，让每位来宾都感觉到头皮发麻，当又一个蠢男人被神秘地迎头一击时，弗吉尼娅的心里便浮现出一丝略带恶作剧的傻笑。","But in vain; the hammer hidden up her sleeve hovered over the head of every guest, and every guest felt his scalp creep, and Virginia felt her inside creep with a little, mischievous, slightly idiotic grin, as still another fool male was mystically knocked on the head."
"这是一种怪异离奇的游戏。","It was a sort of uncanny sport."
"的确，这个计划——让弗吉尼娅恋爱结婚的计划——是不会实现的。","No, the plan was not going to work: the plan of having Virginia fall in love and marry."
"当然，这些男人是如此愚蠢，如此窝囊。","Of course the men were such lumps, such oeufs farcies."
"至少，还有一个是博多恩太太真正寄予希望的。","There was one, at least, that Mrs Bodoin had real hopes of."
"他是一个健康、正常、英俊、家庭出身不错的小伙子，虽然没有钱，可在上议院当文书，很有前途，虽不很精明，但完全爱上了弗吉尼娅的聪颖。","He was a healthy and normal and very good-looking boy of good family, with no money, alas, but clerking to the House of Lords and very hopeful, and not very clever, but simply in love with Virginia’s cleverness."
"他也正是博多恩太太自己想嫁的那种男人。","He was just the one Mrs Bodoin would have married for herself."
"的确，他仅有二十六岁，而弗吉尼娅三十一岁了。","True, he was only twenty-six, to Virginia’s thirty-one."
"不过他在牛津八人赛艇队中当过划手，并且喜欢马，一聊起马就充满了敬慕之情，同时也完全被弗吉尼娅的聪颖迷得神魂颠倒。","But he had rowed in the Oxford eight, and adored horses, talked horses adorably, and was simply infatuated by Virginia’s cleverness."
"对他而言，弗吉尼娅拥有世界上最出色的头脑。","To him Virginia had the finest mind on earth."
"她和柏拉图一样了不起，但却更加有魅力，因为她是女人，故此更加引人注目。","She was as wonderful as Plato, but infinitely more attractive, because she was a woman, and winsome with it."
"想象一下，一个迷人的柏拉图，满头凌乱的鬈发，眯缝着褐色的小眼睛，仅仅暗示出女人对保护者的一种让人爱怜的渴求，由此你就可以猜想阿德里安对弗吉尼娅的感情了。","Imagine a winsome Plato with untidy curls and the tiniest little brown-eyed squint and just a hint of woman’s pathetic need for a protector, and you may imagine Adrian’s feeling for Virginia."
"他对她爱慕不已，完全被她征服。不过他觉得自己可以保护她。","He adored her on his knees, but he felt he could protect her."
"“当然，他实在是个很不错的小伙子！”博多恩太太说，","“Of course he’s just a very nice boy!” said Mrs Bodoin."
"“他是个小伙子，你只能这么说。","“He’s a boy, and that’s all you can say."
"而且他永远都是一个小伙子。","And he always will be a boy."
"不过那才是男人中最好的一类，你能与之生活的唯一的一类：永远的小伙子。","But that’s the very nicest kind of man, the only kind you can live with: the eternal boy."
"弗吉尼娅，难道你没被他迷住吗？”","Virginia, aren’t you attracted to him?”"
"“有的，妈妈！","“Yes, Mother!"
"我认为他就像你说的那样是个非常不错的小伙子。”弗吉尼娅回答说，声音相当舒缓悦耳，又有些顽皮。","I think he’s an awfully nice boy, as you say,” replied Virginia, in her rather slow, musical, whimsical voice."
"可是那声调中小小的嘲弄味意味着阿德里安没戏唱了。","But the mocking little curl in the intonation put the lid on Adrian."
"弗吉尼娅才不打算嫁给一个好小伙呢！","Virginia was not marrying a nice boy!"
"她也可能是故意使坏，跟她母亲的品味对着干。","She could be malicious too, against her mother’s taste."
"于是博多恩太太略微做了个不耐烦的手势让她走开了。","And Mrs Bodoin let escape her a faint gesture of impatience."
"因为她一直在计划着自己的隐退，倘若弗吉尼娅会嫁给阿德里安的话，她打算立马将整个公寓和自己收入的一半都交给弗吉尼娅。","For she had been planning her own retreat, planning to give Virginia the apartment outright, and half of her own income, if she would marry Adrian."
"是的，这位母亲早就已经在算计，一旦弗吉尼娅同那个尽管有点缺少头脑却非常迷人的小伙子幸福地结婚，她怎样能靠一年三百英镑过着最体面的日子。","Yes, the mother was already scheming how best she could live with dignity on three hundred a year, once Virginia was happily married to that most attractive if slightly brainless boy."
"一年以后，此时弗吉尼娅三十二了，阿德里安已娶了一位富有的美国姑娘，同时还被调往驻华盛顿的公使馆工作，他一到伦敦便诚心诚意地来看弗吉尼娅了，忠诚地拜倒在她脚下，忠诚地认为她是最迷人的精神尤物，而且忠诚地认为弗吉尼娅本可以同他一起创造奇迹的，可是这种奇迹已经永远不会实现了，因为他此时已经结婚了。","A year later, when Virginia was thirty-two, Adrian, who had married a wealthy American girl and been transferred to a job in the legation at Washington in the meantime, faithfully came to see Virginia as soon as he was in London, faithfully kneeled at her feet, faithfully thought her the most wonderful spiritual being, and faithfully felt that she, Virginia, could have done wonders with him, which wonders would now never be done, for he had married in the meantime."
"弗吉尼娅看上去面容枯槁、疲惫不堪。","Virginia was looking haggard and worn."
"她与母亲的两人之家的计划没有成功。","The scheme of a ménage à deux with her mother had not succeeded."
"而现在，工作使这个年轻女人疲惫不堪。","And now, work was telling on the younger woman."
"不错，她灵巧敏捷，令人惊叹。","It is true, she was amazingly facile."
"可她不能自始至终都依靠这样的灵巧敏捷。","But facility wouldn’t get her all the way."
"她得去挣自己那份钱，而且挣得很辛苦。","She had to earn her money, and earn it hard."
"她得勤恳工作，而且必须专心致志。","She had to slog, and she had to concentrate."
"当她可以凭借灵敏的直觉而且不用担什么责任地工作时，工作使她感到兴奋。","While she could work by quick intuition and without much responsibility, work thrilled her."
"但一旦她不得不踏踏实实地工作时，就像他们所说的那样，在一个真正要承担责任的岗位上，兢兢业业、勤勤恳恳、全神贯注，工作便弄得她疲惫不堪。","But as soon as she had to get down to it, as they say, grip and slog and concentrate, in a really responsible position, it wore her out terribly."
"她不得不神经高度紧张地工作。","She had to do it all off her nerves."
"她没有男人那样的战斗力。","She hadn’t the same sort of fighting power as a man."
"一个男人可以唤起自己与生俱来的男人本性去拼命干好自己的工作，可一个女人不得不靠勇气，并且只能靠勇气。","Where a man can summon his old Adam in him to fight through his work, a woman has to draw on her nerves, and on her nerves alone."
"因为女人的本性和这种工作毫无关系。","For the old Eve in her will have nothing to do with such work."
"因此，精神上的责任感、心智上的专心致志和精神上的殚精竭虑可怕地折磨着一个女人，特别是当她作为一个部门的头儿，不是为别人工作的时候。","So that mental responsibility, mental concentration, mental slogging wear out a woman terribly, especially if she is head of a department, and not working for somebody."
"就这样，可怜的弗吉尼娅被弄得精疲力竭。","So poor Virginia was worn out."
"她变得骨瘦如柴。","She was thin as a rail."
"她的精神彻底崩溃了。","Her nerves were frayed to bits."
"可是她怎么也放不下那令人厌恶的工作。","And she could never forget her beastly work."
"她常常在晚茶时分回到家里，一言不发，疲惫不堪。","She would come home at teatime speechless and done for."
"一看见她这副样子，她母亲便痛苦不堪，真想说：是不是遇上什么麻烦了，弗吉尼娅？","Her mother, tortured by the sight of her, longed to say: Has anything gone wrong, Virginia?"
"你今天在办公室里遇到了什么特别烦心的事儿吗？——但她学会了保持沉默，一言不语。","Have you had anything particularly trying at the office today?—But she learned to hold her tongue, and say nothing."
"这个问题对弗吉尼娅那可怜而劳累过度的神经会是无法忍受的最后一击，而尽管博多恩太太缄默忍让，也会有一点冒犯这位老妇人，戳到她内心痛处的小插曲。","The question would be the last straw to Virginia’s poor overwrought nerves, and there would be a little scene which, despite Mrs Bodoin’s calm and forbearance, offended the elder woman to the quick."
"之前的痛苦经历使她学会了不去理会这孩子，就像人们不去理会一只易裂的硫酸桶一样。","She had learned, by bitter experience, to leave her child alone, as one would leave a frail tube of vitriol alone."
"但是，当然，她不可能不挂念着弗吉尼娅。","But of course, she could not keep her mind off Virginia."
"不挂念是不可能的。","That was impossible."
"而不幸的弗吉尼娅，在工作压力以及她母亲那种令人生畏的不断关怀之下，处在了心力憔悴的最边缘。","And poor Virginia, under the strain of work and the strain of her mother’s awful ceaseless mind, was at the very end of her strength and resources."
"博多恩太太一直不喜欢弗吉尼娅去工作。","Mrs Bodoin had always disliked the fact of Virginia’s doing a job."
"而现在她则是憎恨这个事实了。","But now she hated it."
"她对整个政府机构怀有强烈而恶毒的憎恨。它不但把弗吉尼娅困在那里，使她失去尊严，而且还把她，博多恩太太的女儿，变成了一个瘦削如柴、唠叨不休、令人生畏的老处女。","She hated the whole government office with violent and virulent hate.Not only was it undignified for Virginia to be tied up there, but it was turning her, Mrs Bodoin’s daughter, into a thin, nagging, fearsome old maid."
"难道还有什么事更能使一个出生名门的爱尔兰女人完全变成一副英国人的德性，使她蒙受更大的耻辱吗？","Could anything be more utterly English and humiliating to a well-born Irishwoman?"
"整整一天，博多恩太太都在收拾这套公寓，熟练地织补其中一把锦缎椅子，擦亮几面威尼斯风格的镜子，一直擦到自己满意为止，挑选鲜花，买东西和料理家务，精心地照料家里的一切，下午精力不竭地接待了一些访客，喝完下午茶后离开会客厅上楼去写了几封信，洗个澡，精心打扮一番——她很乐于装扮自己——然后才像邹菊一样鲜艳亮丽地下来吃饭，不过比那静静的花儿更加精神饱满。","After a long day attending to the apartment, skilfully darning one of the brocade chairs, polishing the Venetian mirrors to her satisfaction, selecting flowers, doing certain shopping and housekeeping, attending perfectly to everything, then receiving callers in the afternoon, with never-ending energy, Mrs Bodoin would go up from the drawing-room after tea and write a few letters, take her bath, dress with great care—she enjoyed attending to her person—and come down to dinner as fresh as a daisy, but far more energetic than that quiet flower."
"她现在准备好要度过一个完美的夜晚。","She was ready now for a full evening."
"她痛苦焦急地感觉到弗吉尼娅就在家里，可是直到晚饭开始的时候才见到自己的女儿。","She was conscious, with gnawing anxiety, of Virginia’s presence in the house, but she did not see her daughter till dinner was announced."
"弗吉尼娅悄然而入，然后直奔她自己的房间躲着不见人，也从不到客厅来用茶点。","Virginia slipped in, and away to her room unseen, never going into the drawing-room to tea."
"如果博多恩太太听到女儿用钥匙开锁的声音，她便会快速地退回到某间屋子，直到弗吉尼娅安全通过。","If Mrs Bodoin heard her daughter’s key in the latch, she quickly retired into one of the rooms till Virginia was safely through."
"对可怜的弗吉尼娅来说，当她从办公室回来时，仅仅是看到家里有人神经就会非常紧张。","It was too much for poor Virginia’s nerves even to catch sight of anybody in the house, when she came in from the office."
"若听到客厅里那些来访者的喃喃细语声便更受不了了。","Bad enough to hear the murmur of visitors’ voices behind the drawing-room door."
"于是博多恩太太便会纳闷：她怎么啦？","And Mrs Bodoin would wonder: How is she?"
"她今天晚上会怎么样？","How is she to-night?"
"我想知道她度过了怎样的一天？——这种挂念会徘徊在房子里，徘徊到弗吉尼娅在自己的房间里仰面躺着的地方。","I wonder what sort of a day she’s had?—And this thought would roam prowling through the house, to where Virginia was lying on her back in her room."
"可是这位母亲不得不消磨着她的焦虑不安，直到晚饭时分。","But the mother would have to consume her anxiety till dinner-time."
"那时弗吉尼娅就会出现，眼圈发黑、瘦骨嶙峋、神色紧张，一个刚下了班的年轻女人，浑身上下透着如此痕迹：衣着不得体，幽默中略带尖酸刻薄，受工作折磨，胃口不佳，对任何事都毫无兴趣。","And then Virginia would appear, with black lines under her eyes, thin, tense, a young woman out of an office, the stigma upon her: badly dressed, a little acid in humour, with an impaired digestion, not interested in anything, blighted by her work."
"博多恩太太一看到她这副模样便觉得丢脸，但她完全能够克制住自己，只是轻描淡写地说几句无关痒痛的话，姿态优美地坐着，守着一桌纯粹为取悦弗吉尼娅而精心烹制的饭菜。","And Mrs Bodoin, humiliated at the very sight of her, would control herself perfectly, say nothing but the mere smooth nothings of casual speech, and sit in perfect form presiding at a carefully-cooked dinner thought out entirely to please Virginia."
"那时，弗吉尼娅根本没在意自己吃了些什么。","Then Virginia hardly noticed what she ate."
"博多恩太太渴望着一个充满活力的夜晚。","Mrs Bodoin was pining for an evening with life in it."
"而弗吉尼娅会躺在长沙发上，然后打开扬声器。","But Virginia would lie on the couch and put on the loudspeaker."
"或者她会在留声机上放一盘幽默唱片，被逗乐了之后，会再听一遍，又被逗乐了之后，再听一遍，一连听上六遍，一连被这样一盘略带幽默的唱片逗乐了六次，而博多恩太太都已经把这盘唱片的内容熟记于心了。","Or she would put a humorous record on the gramophone, and be amused, and hear it again, and be amused, and hear it again, six times, and six times be amused by a mildly funny record that Mrs Bodoin now knew off by heart."
"“哎呀，弗吉尼娅，要是你乐意，我可以给你背诵那盘唱片，你就不必费事地去摇唱机了。”——而弗吉尼娅呢，停顿了一下，好像没有听清母亲说什么，然后回答道：“我确信你能，妈妈。”","“Why, Virginia, I could repeat that record over to you, if you wished it, without your troubling to wind up that gramophone.”—And Virginia, after a pause in which she seemed not to have heard what her mother said, would reply, “I’m sure you could, mother”."
"这简单的一句话表达出对雷切尔·博多恩本人、过去及其能力等所有一切的蔑视，蔑视她的精力、她的活力、她的智力、她的身体甚至是她本身的存在，这不禁令这位老妇人寒心。","And that simple speech would convey such volumes of contempt for all that Rachel Bodoin was or ever could be or ever had been, contempt for her energy, her vitality, her mind, her body, her very existence, that the elder woman would curl."
"这就好似罗伯特·博多恩的灵魂极其恶毒地借女儿之口说话——然后，弗吉尼娅第七次放上了这张唱片。","It seemed as if the ghost of Robert Bodoin spoke out of the mouth of the daughter, in deadly venom.—Then Virginia would put on the record for the seventh time."
"在尴尬难堪的第二年里，博多恩太太意识到这场游戏结束了。","During the second ghastly year, Mrs Bodoin realized that the game was up."
"她成了一个精神垮掉的女人，一个再也没有目标和意义的女人了。","She was a beaten woman, a woman without object or meaning any more."
"她那令人生畏的女性幽默之锤，曾经砸在了许多人的头上，实际上，砸过所有她曾经接触过的人，现在这重锤则向后抡去，砸在了她自己的头上。","The hammer of her awful female humour, which had knocked so many people on the head, all the people, in fact, that she had come into contact with, had at last flown backwards and hit herself on the head."
"因为她女儿是她的另一个自我，她的另一面。","For her daughter was her other self, her alter ego."
"博多恩太太一生的秘密、意义和力量都贮藏在这把铁锤上，这把对一切事物都要当头一击的活生生的幽默之锤。","The secret and the meaning and the power of Mrs Bodoin’s whole life lay in the hammer, that hammer of her living humour which knocked everything on the head."
"幽默地给予每个人、每件事物当头一击一直都是她的欲望，她的激情。","That had been her lust and her passion, knocking everybody and everything humorously on the head."
"她觉得从中受到了启发：这是一项使命。","She had felt inspired in it: it was a sort of mission."
"并且她曾希望将这把锤子传给弗吉尼娅，她那聪颖、虽不可靠但仍旧真实的女儿，弗吉尼娅。","And she had hoped to hand on the hammer to Virginia, her clever, unsolid but still actual daughter, Virginia."
"弗吉尼娅是雷切尔自我的延续。","Virginia was the continuation of Rachel’s own self."
"弗吉尼娅是雷切尔的变体，是她的另外一个自我。","Virginia was Rachel’s alter ego, her other self."
"可是，唉，这只说对了一半。","But, alas, it was a half-truth."
"弗吉尼娅曾经有一个父亲。","Virginia had had a father."
"这个一直被这位母亲完全忽略的事实，通过那锤子怪异的反弹，渐渐地被她所了解。","This fact, which had been utterly ignored by the mother, was gradually brought home to her by the curious recoil of the hammer."
"弗吉尼娅还是她父亲的女儿。","Virginia was her father’s daughter."
"在自然万物的结局当中，还有更不体面、更令人恐惧、更违反常情的事情吗？","Could anything be more unseemly, horrid, more perverse in the natural scheme of things?"
"因为罗伯特·博多恩已经被雷切尔的锤子彻底地、理所当然地当头击中。","For Robert Bodoin had been fully and deservedly knocked on the head by Rachel’s hammer."
"可他竟然在博多恩太太自己的女儿，她的另一个自我，也就是弗吉尼娅的身上复活了，而且开始用一把有点儿恶毒的锤子回击了，那简直就是戴维的卵石与哥利亚的战斧在作战！还有什么比这更令人恶心的吗？","Could anything, then, be more disgusting than that he should resurrect again in the person of Mrs Bodoin’s own daughter, her own alter ego Virginia, and start hitting back with a little spiteful hammer that was David’s pebble against Goliath’s battle-axe!"
"可是那小小的卵石是致命的。","But the little pebble was mortal."
"博多恩太太感觉它陷进了她的额头、她的太阳穴，她完了。","Mrs Bodoin felt it sink into her brow, her temple, and she was finished."
"锤子从她手中无力地掉落下来。","The hammer fell nerveless from her hand."
"现在这两个女人大部分时间里都是独处。","The two women were now mostly alone."
"弗吉尼娅太劳累了，晚上就不想去招待客人了。","Virginia was too tired to have company in the evening."
"因此就与留声机或扬声器为伴，或保持寂静沉默。","So there was the gramophone or loudspeaker, or else silence."
"两个女人开始憎恶起这寓所来了。","Both women had come to loathe the apartment."
"弗吉尼娅认为这是她母亲横行霸道的最后的绝招，她感觉自己被那独断的欧比松地毯，那令人厌恶的威尼斯式镜子，那过于精心摆弄的大束鲜花所欺压。","Virginia felt it was the last grand act of bullying on her mother’s part, she felt bullied by the assertive Aubusson carpet, by the beastly Venetian mirrors, by the big overcultured flowers."
"她甚至觉得受到那精美饭菜的侮辱，于是再次怀念起索霍饭店和旅馆里她那两间简陋破旧的房间。","She even felt bullied by the excellent food, and longed again for a Soho restaurant and her two poky shabby rooms in the hotel."
"她讨厌这个寓所，她憎恶每件事物。","She loathed the apartment: she loathed everything."
"但她没有精力搬家了。","But she had not the energy to move."
"她没精力做任何事情。","She had not the energy to do anything."
"她慢悠悠地去干她的工作，其余时间里她就平躺在那里混时间。","She crawled to her work, and for the rest, she lay flat, gone."
"正是弗吉尼娅精疲力竭的懒散模样真正击垮了博多恩太太。","It was Virginia’s worn-out inertia that really finished Mrs Bodoin."
"那正是击碎她太阳穴骨的卵石。“不得不参加我女儿的葬礼，接受所有她办公室职员的慰问，不，那是最大的屈辱，我必须免遭其伤害。","That was the pebble that broke the bone of her temple: “To have to attend my daughter’s funeral, and accept the sympathy of all her fellow-clerks in her office, no, that is a final humiliation which I must spare myself."
"不！","No!"
"如果弗吉尼娅一定要当个女职员的话，从今以后她必须自己负责任。","If Virginia must be a lady-clerk, she must be it henceforth on her own responsibility."
"我要从她的生活中退出来。”","I will retire from her existence.”"
"博多恩太太曾努力设法说服弗吉尼娅放弃工作来和她一起住。","Mrs Bodoin had tried hard to persuade Virginia to give up her work and come and live with her."
"博多恩太太还曾提出把她收入的一半给弗吉尼娅。","She had offered her half her income."
"都是白费力气。","In vain."
"弗吉尼娅仍坚守在自己的岗位上。","Virginia stuck to her office."
"好吧！","Very well!"
"就那样好了！——这间寓所真是一大败笔，博多恩太太真想，真想再把它撕得粉碎。","So be it!—The apartment was a fiasco, Mrs Bodoin was longing, longing to tear it to pieces again."
"这把锤子最后的、最终的一击！——“弗吉尼娅，难道你不觉得我们最好处理掉这间寓所，像过去那样这里住住那里住住吗？","One last and final blow of the hammer!—“Virginia, don’t you think we’d better get rid of this apartment, and live around as we used to?"
"难道你不认为我们应该那样做吗？”——“但是你投进去的那些钱怎么办？","Don’t you think we’ll do that?”—“But all the money you’ve put into it?"
"而且租期是十年呢！”弗吉尼娅用一种懒洋洋的口吻叫喊道。——“不要紧！","And the lease for ten years!” cried Virginia, in a kind of inertia.—“Never mind!"
"我们愿意花这钱。","We had the pleasure of making it."
"并且我们住在这里已经享受了该享受的乐趣。","And we’ve had as much pleasure out of living in it as we shall ever have."
"现在我们最好处理掉它——尽快——难道你不觉得吗？”","Now we’d better get rid of it—quickly—don’t you think?”"
"此时此刻，博多恩太太猛然伸展双臂把画从墙上扯了下来，卷起了那张欧比松式地毯，把瓷器从镶有象牙的橱柜中抓了出来。","Mrs Bodoin’s arms were twitching to snatch the pictures off the walls, roll up the Aubusson carpet, take the china out of the ivory-inlaid cabinet there and then, at that very moment."
"“我们等到星期天再做决定吧。”弗吉尼娅说道。","“Let us wait till Sunday before we decide,” said Virginia."
"“等到星期天！","“Till Sunday!"
"还有四天！","Four days!"
"要那么久吗？","As long as that?"
"难道我们各自心里还没做出决定吗？”博多恩太太说。","Haven’t we already decided in our own minds?” said Mrs Bodoin."
"“无论如何，我们得等到星期天。”弗吉尼娅说道。","“We’ll wait till Sunday, anyhow,” said Virginia."
"次日晚上，那个亚美尼亚人过来吃晚饭。","The next evening, the Armenian came to dinner."
"弗吉尼娅叫他阿诺德，用法语发音就叫阿尔诺。","Virginia called him Arnold, with the French pronunciation, Arnault."
"博多恩太太简直受不了他，而且怎么也记不住他的名字，那名字似乎相当拗口，她要么叫他亚美尼亚人，要么以蜜饯的名字称他为拉哈特·拉科姆，要么干脆称他叫土耳其软糖。","Mrs Bodoin, who barely tolerated him, and could never get his name, which seemed to have a lot of bouyoums in it, called him either the Armenian, or the Rahat Lakoum, after the name of the sweetmeat, or simply The Turkish Delight."
"“阿尔诺今晚要来吃晚饭，妈妈。”","“Arnault is coming to dinner to-night, Mother.”"
"“真的吗？","“Really!"
"土耳其软糖要来这里吃晚饭？","The Turkish Delight is coming here to dinner?"
"我该准备些特色饭菜吗？”——她的声音听起来好像她要推荐蜗牛冻肉似的。","Shall I provide anything special?”—Her voice sounded as if she would suggest snails in aspic."
"“我认为没必要。”","“I don’t think so.”"
"弗吉尼娅在办公室和这位亚美尼亚人见过很多面，当时她必须代表商务部同他洽谈。","Virginia had seen a good deal of the Armenian at the office, when she had to negotiate with him on behalf of the Board of Trade."
"他是个约六十岁的男人，一个商人，曾是个百万富翁，战争期间破产了，但现在又开始恢复元气了，并当上了保加利亚的贸易代表。","He was a man of about sixty, a merchant, had been a millionaire, was ruined during the war, but was now coming on again, and represented trade in Bulgaria."
"他想跟英国政府进行洽谈，英国政府明智地先通过中间人弗吉尼娅与他进行谈判。","He wanted to negotiate with the British Government, and the British Government sensibly negotiated with him: at first through the medium of Virginia."
"现在，阿尔诺先生——弗吉尼娅如是称呼他——和商务部之间的事务进展得令人满意，因而公务往来之后紧接着便产生了一种友谊。","Now things were going satisfactorily between Monsieur Arnault, as Virginia called him, and the Board of Trade, so that a sort of friendship had followed the official relations."
"土耳其软糖六十了，头发灰白，身体肥胖。","The Turkish Delight was sixty, grey-haired and fat."
"在保加利亚，他有很多正在长大成人的孙辈，但他仍然是个鳏夫。","He had numerous grandchildren growing up in Bulgaria, but he was a widower."
"他的灰白胡子修剪得像把刷子，呆滞无神的褐色眼睛上垂着沉重的眼睑，睫毛是白色的。","He had a grey moustache cut like a brush, and glazed brown eyes over which hung heavy lids with white lashes."
"他举止谦卑，可他的神态中透着一种固执的自负。","His manner was humble, but in his bearing there was a certain dogged conceit."
"人们注意到有时犹太人身上具有这二者的结合。","One notices the combination sometimes in Jews."
"他曾经非常富有，人们都对他卑躬屈膝，他也曾倾家荡产、备受羞辱，而如今他又顽强地东山再起了，有他远在保加利亚的儿子们为他撑腰呢。","He had been very wealthy and kow-towed to, he had been ruined and humiliated, terribly humiliated, and now, doggedly, he was rising up again, his sons backing him, away in Bulgaria."
"人们觉得他并不是孤身一人。","One felt he was not alone."
"在他身后有着远在近东的儿子、家庭和家族。","He had his sons, his family, his tribe behind him, away in the Near East."
"他的英语讲得很糟糕，但带着小舌音的法语却讲得相当流利。","He spoke bad English, but fairly fluent guttural French."
"他的话不多，只管坐着。","He did not speak much, but he sat."
"他坐着，两条大腿又短又肥，仿佛他要永恒地坐在那儿。","He sat, with his short, fat thighs, as if for eternity, there."
"他那静止不动的肥硕身躯里有着一种奇特的力量，仿佛他的臀部连接着地球的正中心。","There was a strange potency in his fat immobile sitting, as if his posterior were connected with the very centre of the earth."
"而他那一门心思只想着做生意的头脑，则相当敏捷。","And his brain, spinning away at the one point in question, business, was very agile."
"他心无旁骛地做生意。","Business absorbed him."
"但并不是用一种紧张，私人的方式做生意。","But not in a nervous, personal way."
"不知怎地，他总是感觉家庭、家族就在他的身后。","Somehow the family, the tribe was always felt behind him."
"这是为家庭和家族而做的生意。","It was business for the family, the tribe."
"同英国人在一起时，他就显得谦卑，因为英国人喜欢这样的外国人表现得卑躬屈膝，并且他还在土耳其人那里接受过长期的教育。","With the English he was humble, for the English like such aliens to be humble, and he had had a long schooling from the Turks."
"并且他永远是一个局外人。","And he was always an outsider."
"在社会上，没有人愿意理会他。","Nobody would ever take any notice of him in society."
"他只不过是个局外人，坐在一旁。","He would just be an outsider, sitting."
"“我希望，弗吉尼娅，当我们招待其他宾客时，你别请那个土耳其地毯绅士来。","“I hope, Virginia, you won’t ask that Turkish-carpet gentleman when we have other people."
"我可以容忍他。”博多恩太太说，","I can bear it,” said Mrs Bodoin."
"“而有些人可能会介意。”","“Some people might mind.”"
"“在你自己的家中却不能选择自己的宾客，这不太无情了吗！”弗吉尼娅讥讽道。","“Isn’t it hard when you can’t choose your own company in your own house!” mocked Virginia."
"“不！","“No!"
"我无所谓。","I don’t care."
"我能够应付一切，而且我相信，卖起土耳其地毯来，你那个熟人会相当擅长。","I can meet anything; and I’m sure, in the way of selling Turkish carpets, your acquaintance is very good."
"但是，我想你不会把他看作私人朋友吧——？”","But I don’t suppose you look on him as a personal friend—?”"
"“我是把他当做私人朋友。","“I do."
"我非常喜欢他。”","I like him quite a lot.”"
"“好吧——！随你便。","“Well—! as you will."
"但替你的其他朋友想想吧。”","But consider your other friends.”"
"这次博多恩太太的自尊心是真的受到了伤害。","Mrs Bodoin was really mortified this time."
"她看待这亚美尼亚人就像人们看待头戴土耳其毡帽在赛德港或在尼斯海岸设法兜售丑陋挂毯的肥胖的黎凡特人一样，他算不上人类，他被看作是昆虫类。","She looked on the Armenian as one looks on the fat Levantine in a fez who tries to sell one hideous tapestries at Port Said, or on the sea-front at Nice, as being outside the class of human beings, and in the class of insects."
"他曾经是个百万富翁，而且可能会重新成为百万富翁的这个事实只是让她厌恶被迫同这样的渣滓交往之外又增添了几分恶意。","That he had been a millionaire, and might be a millionaire again, only added venom to her feeling of disgust at being forced into contact with such scum."
"她甚至无法碾碎他，或者消灭他。","She could not even squash him, or annihilate him."
"在渣滓中，没有什么东西可碾碎的了，因为渣滓已是被碾碎的、令人讨厌的残渣，除此之外什么也不是。","In scum, there is nothing to squash, for scum is only the unpleasant residue of that which was never anything but squashed."
"然而，她并不是非常公平。","However, she was not quite just."
"不错，他是胖，大腿粗短，而且坐着就像癞蛤蟆一样，像一只癞蛤蟆永恒地坐着一样。","True, he was fat, and he sat, with short thighs, like a toad, as if seated for a toad’s eternity."
"他的脸色是一种暗淡的浆糊色，沉沉的眼睑下那双黑眼睛显得呆滞无神。","His colour was of a dirty sort of paste, his black eyes were glazed under heavy lids."
"而且，除非别人跟他说话，否则他绝不开口，在他那癞蛤蟆式的安静中，像个奴隶般地候着。","And he never spoke until spoken to, waiting in his toad’s silence, like a slave."
"不过，他那浓密细软的灰白头发，像把软刷似的竖立在他的脑瓜上，出奇地具有男子气概。","But his thick, fine white hair, which stood up on his head like a soft brush, was curiously virile."
"他那双小得离奇的手，肤色同样是略微暗淡的浆糊色，却有着他们家族特有的肥胖而柔和的男子气。","And his curious small hands, of the same soft dull paste, had a peculiar, fat, soft masculine breeding of their own."
"他那双暗棕色的眼睛在白刷子般的睫毛下面闪烁着巨蛇那样的狡猾目光。","And his dull brown eye could glint with the subtlety of serpents, under the white brush of eyelash."
"他疲惫了，但并未被击败。","He was tired, but he was not defeated."
"他奋斗、胜利、失败，然后再奋斗，而且总是处于不利地位。","He had fought, and won, and lost, and was fighting again, always at a disadvantage."
"他属于那种被击败之后接受失败，但又凭借狡诈卷土重来的那一类人。","He belonged to a defeated race which accepts defeat, but which gets its own back by cunning."
"他是儿子们的父亲，是一家之主，是一个可以被击败但不可以被摧毁的家族的长辈之一。","He was the father of sons, the head of a family, one of the heads of a defeated but indestructible tribe."
"他并不是孤身一人，因此你不能伤害他一根毫毛。","He was not alone, and so you could not lay your finger on him."
"他的所有意识都是家长式的，宗族式的。","His whole consciousness was patriarchal and tribal."
"而且不知怎地，他虽然谦卑，却是不可摧毁的。","And somehow, he was humble, but he was indestructible."
"用餐时，他坐在那里，几乎被人遗忘了，他态度谦卑，但谦卑之中又透着自负。","At dinner he sat half-effaced, humble, yet with the conceit of the humble."
"他的举止十分得体，很有法国人的气派。","His manners were perfectly good, rather French."
"弗吉尼娅用法语同他闲聊，他则以那种独特的林荫大道般的冷静应答着，那是他说法语时能表现出来的唯一的举止态度。","Virginia chattered to him in French, and he replied with that peculiar nonchalance of the boulevards, which was the only manner he could command when speaking French."
"博多恩太太能听懂，但她是那种被人们称为蹩脚语言学家的人，她想说什么话的时候，都用英语。","Mrs Bodoin understood, but she was what one would call a heavy-footed linguist, so when she said anything, it was intensely in English."
"于是那位土耳其软糖用他那笨拙的英语慌忙地回答着。","And the Turkish Delight replied in his clumsy English, hastily."
"说法语并不是他的错。","It was not his fault that French was being spoken."
"那是弗吉尼娅的错。","It was Virginia’s."
"和博多恩太太相处时，他显得很温和谦卑。","He was very humble, conciliatory, with Mrs Bodoin."
"但有时他用一种令人厌恶的眼神迅速地朝她一瞥，仿佛在说：是的！","But he cast at her sometimes that rapid glint of a reptilian glance as if to say: Yes!"
"我看到你了！","I see you!"
"你是个漂亮的女人。","You are a handsome figure."
"你几乎就像一件艺术珍品那样完美无缺。——他用他那鉴赏家、古董商的眼光鉴定着她。","As an objet de vertu you are almost perfect.—Thus his connoisseur’s, antique-dealer’s eye would appraise her."
"但随后，他那浓密的白眉毛似乎又补充说：可是，天宇之下，作为女人，你算什么？","But then his thick white eyebrows would seem to add: But what, under holy Heaven, are you as a woman?"
"你既不是妻子，也不是母亲，又不是情妇，你毫无女性的气息，你比一个土耳其士兵或一个英国官员还要可怕。","You are neither wife nor mother nor mistress, you have no perfume of sex, you are more dreadful than a Turkish soldier or an English official."
"世界上没有哪个男人会拥抱你。","No man on earth could embrace you."
"你是个食尸鬼，你是个来自地狱的诡异妖怪！——随后他会暗暗地念叨神的名字来庇佑自己。","You are a ghoul, you are a strange genie from the underworld!—And he would secretly invoke the holy names, to shield him."
"可是他爱上了弗吉尼娅。","Yet he was in love with Virginia."
"首先，他喜欢她身上的孩子气，似乎她就是一个掉落在阴沟里的女孩，一个流浪儿，她那褐色眼睛虽然暗淡无光，但却令人着魔，她一直在等着有人来把她救起。","He saw, first and foremost, the child in her, as if she were a lost child in the gutter, a waif with a faint, fascinating cast in her brown eyes, waiting till someone would pick her up."
"一个没有父亲的流浪儿！","A fatherless waif!"
"然而他是一个家族的父亲，一直都是个父亲。","And he was tribal father, father through all the ages."
"另一方面，他了解她在处理事务时那种独特无私的聪慧。","Then, on the other hand, he knew her peculiar disinterested cleverness in affairs."
"同样让他神魂颠倒的是她那种与众不同的、对生意有着超凡远见的智慧，而这种智慧完全不带私人情感，完全可以被人感知到。","That, too, fascinated him: that odd, almost second-sight cleverness about business, and entirely impersonal, entirely in the air."
"这在他看来非常不可思议。","It seemed to him very strange."
"但这对他的计划有巨大的帮助。","But it would be an immense help to him in his schemes."
"他并没有真正地了解英国人。","He did not really understand the English."
"他和他们交往时感到茫然困惑。","He was at sea with them."
"可与她在一起时，他对一切都有了头绪。","But with her, he would have a clue to everything."
"因为她在这些英国人中间，在这些英国官员中间的确是个挺了不起的人物。","For she was, finally, quite a somebody among these English, these English officials."
"他差不多六十岁了。","He was about sixty."
"他的家族在东方打下了根基，他的孙辈们也渐渐长大成人了。","His family was established, in the East, his grandsons were growing up."
"对他来说，在伦敦住上几年很有必要。","It was necessary for him to live in London, for some years."
"这个姑娘会有用处的。","This girl would be useful."
"除了她将会从她母亲那儿继承的财产以外，她压根儿没钱。","She had no money, save what she would inherit from her mother."
"可他愿意冒险：她将会成为他生意上的一笔投资。","But he would risk that: she would be an investment in his business."
"还有这套寓所。","And then the apartment."
"他非常喜欢这套寓所。","He liked the apartment extremely."
"他意识到了那欧布松地毯的独特品质，其上的百合花与天鹅，真的对他起了作用。","He recognized the cachet, and the lilies and swans of the Aubusson carpet really did something to him."
"弗吉尼娅对他说：母亲把这套寓所给我了。——因此他觉得他的投资稳妥了。还有，弗吉尼娅几乎是个处女，很有可能就是个处女，而且在像他自己这样父亲般的东方男性看来，完全是个处女了。","Virginia said to him: Mother gave me the apartment.—So he looked on that as safe.And finally, Virginia was almost a virgin, probably quite a virgin, and, as far as the paternal oriental male like himself was concerned, entirely virgin."
"他对英国人之间那种可笑幼稚的性行为知之甚少，那与他那种持久的为了自己肉体享受的男性情欲如此不同。","He had a very small idea of the silly puppy-sexuality of the English, so different from the prolonged male voluptuousness of his own pleasures."
"最后，他感到了肉体上的孤独，感到自己渐渐老了、疲惫了。","And last of all, he was physically lonely, getting old, and tired."
"当然，弗吉尼娅不知道她为何喜欢和阿诺德在一起。","Virginia of course did not know why she liked being with Arnault."
"当话题涉及到生活和生计时，她的聪慧就笨拙得令人吃惊。","Her cleverness was amazingly stupid when it came to life, to living."
"她说他“与众不同”。","She said he was “quaint”."
"她说他讲法语时那种林荫大道般的冷静“很逗人”。","She said his nonchalant French of the boulevards was “amusing”."
"她认为他在商业上的狡猾“很迷人”，还认为他浓密的白睫毛下那双呆滞无神的黑眼睛在“威严地”闪烁着。","She found his business cunning “intriguing”, and the glint in his dark glazed eyes, under the white, thick lashes, “sheiky”."
"她经常和他见面，在他住的旅馆里同他一起喝茶，而且有一天跟他一起驾车去了海边。","She saw him quite often, had tea with him in his hotel, and motored with him one day down to the sea."
"当他静静地把她的手握在自己柔和的手中时，他的触摸是如此亲切、如此充满占有欲，他向她倾斜的身子是如此的陌生却又十分自信，以致于尽管她恐惧得发抖，可也无法抗拒。——“你这么瘦，可爱的小瘦东西，你需要歇息，心绪宁静地等着花蕾绽放，可怜的小花蕾，变胖点吧！”他用法语说道。","When he took her hand in his own soft still hands, there was something so caressing, so possessive in his touch, so strange and positive in his leaning towards her, that though she trembled with fear, she was helpless.—“But you are so thin, dear little thin thing, you need repose, repose, for the blossom to open, poor little blossom, to become a little fat!” he said in his French."
"她颤抖着，可是无法抗拒。","She quivered, and was helpless."
"这的确古怪离奇！","It certainly was quaint!"
"他是如此地奇特、自信，他似乎拥有一切力量。","He was so strange and positive, he seemed to have all the power."
"当他意识到她会屈服于他的力量时，他便掌控了整个局面，不再犹豫也不再谦卑了。","The moment he realized that she would succumb into his power, he took full charge of the situation, he lost all his hesitation and his humility."
"他不只是想和她做爱：出于他这些各种各样的原因，他还想要娶她。","He did not want just to make love to her: he wanted to marry her, for all his multifarious reasons."
"而且他必须要让自己成为她的主宰。","And he must make himself master of her."
"他把她的手放到他的唇上，亲吻着她那瘦小的手，他似乎要把她的生命融入到自己的生命中。","He put her hand to his lips, and seemed to draw her life to his in kissing her thin hand."
"“这可怜的孩子累了，她需要歇息，她需要抚爱和呵护。”他用法语说道。","“The poor child is tired, she needs repose, she needs to be caressed and cared for,” he said in his French."
"然后他向她靠得更近了。","And he drew nearer to her."
"她抬起头，畏惧地看着他那白色睫毛下闪亮却疲倦的黑眼睛。","She looked up in dread at his glinting, tired dark eyes under the white lashes."
"但他使出他的全部热情，也深情地凝视着她，猜想她一定会屈服。","But he used all his will, looking back at her heavily and calculating that she must submit."
"他把身体靠得离她很近，然后把一只手温柔地放在她脸上，让她的脸倚在自己的胸前，同时用另一只手安抚地抚摸着她的手臂：“可爱的小东西！","And he brought his body quite near to her, and put his hand softly on her face, and made her lay her face against his breast, as he soothingly stroked her arm with his other hand, “Dear little thing!"
"可爱的小东西哟！","dear little thing!"
"阿诺德是这般深情地爱着她哟！","Arnault loves her so dearly!"
"阿诺德爱她！","Arnault loves her!"
"或许她会嫁给她的阿诺德。","Perhaps she will marry her Arnault."
"亲爱的小姑娘，阿诺德将在她的生活中铺满鲜花，并且要让她的生活充满甜蜜的芳香和满足。”","Dear little girl, Arnault will put flowers in her life, and make her life perfumed with sweetness and content.”"
"她倚在他的胸前，任他抚摸着自己。","She leaned against his breast and let him caress her."
"有一瞬间她想到了自己的母亲，半是心酸半是怀恨。","She gave a fleeting, half poignant, half vindictive thought to her mother."
"接着她感觉到命运，命运之神即将到来。","Then she felt in the air the sense of destiny, destiny."
"哦，太好了，不用再挣扎了。","Oh so nice, not to have to struggle."
"任凭命运之神来做决定吧。","To give way to destiny."
"“她愿意嫁给她的老阿诺德吗？嗯？","“Will she marry her old Arnault?Eh?"
"她愿意嫁给他吗？”他用一种抚慰、柔情却又强迫的口吻问道。","Will she marry him?” he asked in a soothing, caressing voice, at the same time compulsive."
"她仰起头看着他：眉毛浓密却已灰白，黑眼睛疲惫而闪闪发光。","She lifted her head and looked at him: the thick white brows, the glinting, tired dark eyes."
"多么奇特而滑稽啊！","How queer and comic!"
"让他掌控着，这太滑稽了！","How comic to be in his power!"
"他看上去有些困惑。","And he was looking a little baffled."
"“我应该吗？”她说着，顽皮地咧着嘴笑了笑。","“Shall I?” she said, with her mischievous twist of a grin."
"“是的！”他睁着他那老练沉静的双眼说，","“Mais oui!” he said, with all the sang froid of his old eyes."
"“是的！","“Mais oui!"
"我会让你满意的，你会看到这一点的。”","Je te contenterai, tu le verras.”"
"“你会让我满意！”她看到他这副信誓旦旦的样子，感到很有趣，于是笑了笑说：","“Tu me contenteras!” she said, with a flickering smile of real amusement at his assurance."
"“你真的会让我心满意足？”","“Will you really content me?”"
"“那当然！","“But surely!"
"我向你保证。","I assure it you."
"那你愿意嫁给我吗？”","And you will marry me?”"
"“你必须告诉母亲。”她说着，又淘气地依偎在他的西装背心上，此时此刻他身上的那种男性的骄傲充盈着他的全身。","“You must tell mother,” she said, and hid wickedly against his waistcoat again, while the male pride triumphed in him."
"博多恩太太不知道弗吉尼娅同土耳其软糖关系亲密：她从不打探女儿的行踪。","Mrs Bodoin had no idea that Virginia was intimate with the Turkish Delight: she did not inquire into her daughter’s movements."
"在这次有名的晚宴上，她平静中略带着些冷漠，但非常冷静沉着。","During the famous dinner, she was calm and a little aloof, but entirely self-possessed."
"用过咖啡之后，弗吉尼娅就离开了，只留下她和土耳其软糖在一起，她没有做出任何尝试来发起谈话，只是瞥了瞥这个身穿得体晚礼服的矮胖男人，心想他这样的胖子怎么符合《巴格达之贼》中头戴土耳其毡帽、身穿宽大穆斯林马裤的集市商贩形象。","When, after coffee, Virginia left her alone with the Turkish Delight, she made no effort at conversation, only glanced at the rather short, stout man in correct dinner-jacket, and thought how his sort of fatness called for a fez and the full muslin breeches of a bazaar merchant in The Thief of Baghdad."
"“你果真喜欢抽水烟袋吗？”她慢吞吞地拉长调子问他。","“Do you really prefer to smoke a hookah?” she asked him, with a slow drawl."
"“请问，水烟袋是什么？”","“What is a hookah, please?”"
"“水烟的一种。","“One of those water-pipes."
"在东方，你们所有人不都抽这个吗？”","Don’t you all smoke them, in the East?”"
"他看起来一脸茫然、谦卑温顺，接着便缄默不语了。","He only looked mystified and humble, and silence resumed."
"她根本不知道他沉静的心中在酝酿着什么。","She little knew what was simmering inside his stillness."
"“夫人，”他说，“我想恳求您一件事儿。”","“Madame,” he said, “I want to ask you something.”"
"“是吗？","“You do?"
"那干吗不说呢？”传来她那略带忧郁的慢吞吞的调子。","Then why not ask it?” came her slightly melancholy drawl."
"“好吧！","“Yes!"
"是这样的。","It is this."
"我希望我能有幸娶到您的女儿。","I wish I may have the honour to marry your daughter."
"她是情愿的。”","She is willing.”"
"接下来那一刻是完全的沉默。","There was a moment’s blank pause."
"随后博多恩太太异常严肃地向他倾过身子。","Then Mrs Bodoin leaned towards him from her distance, with curious portentousness."
"“你刚刚说什么？”她问，","“What was that you said?” she asked."
"“再说一遍！”","“Repeat it!”"
"“我希望我能有幸娶到您的女儿。","“I wish I may have the honour to marry your daughter."
"她愿意接受我。”","She is willing to take me.”"
"他目光呆滞的黑眼睛看了看她，然后又闪开了。","His dark, glazed eyes looked at her, then glanced away again."
"她仍向前探着身子，目不转睛地凝视着他，好像被施了魔法，变成了石头一样。","Still leaning forward, she gazed fixedly on him, as if spellbound, turned to stone."
"她佩戴着粉红的宝石饰品，但他判断那是很普通的人造宝石。","She was wearing pink topaz ornaments, but he judged they were paste, moderately good."
"“我是不是听见你说她愿意接受你？”那缓慢、阴郁而冷淡声音说道。","“Did I hear you say she is willing to take you?” came the slow, melancholy, remote voice."
"“夫人，我想是这样的。”他说着，鞠了一躬。","“Madame, I think so,” he said, with a bow."
"“我想，我们得等她来了再说。”她说着，回过身去。","“I think we’ll wait till she comes,” she said, leaning back."
"一阵沉默。","There was silence."
"她凝视着天花板。","She stared at the ceiling."
"他则仔细地环顾着房间，看了看了家具和镶饰着象牙的橱柜中摆放的瓷器。","He looked closely round the room, at the furniture, at the china in the ivory-inlaid cabinet."
"“我可以赠给弗吉尼娅小姐五千英镑，夫人。”传来了他的声音，","“I can settle five thousand pounds on Mademoiselle Virginia, Madame,” came his voice."
"“她会把这座公寓和公寓里的家具纳入婚姻授产协议，我猜得对吗？”","“Am I correct to assume that she will bring this apartment and its appointments into the marriage settlement?”"
"一阵完全的沉默。","Absolute silence."
"他如同在月球上一般。","He might as well have been on the moon."
"可他是一个定力很好的人。","But he was a good sitter."
"他就那样坐着，直到弗吉尼娅进来。","He just sat until Virginia came in."
"博多恩太太仍然凝视着天花板。","Mrs Bodoin was still staring at the ceiling."
"她的心像被刀完全彻底地刺穿了一样的痛苦。","The iron had entered her soul finally and fully."
"弗吉尼娅瞥了她一眼，却说：","Virginia glanced at her, but said:"
"“阿诺德，喝杯威士忌苏打酒好吗？”","“Have a whisky-and-soda, Arnault?”"
"他起身走向酒瓶，然后站在她旁边：一个相当粗壮矮胖的男人，一头白发，因心存忧虑而沉默不语。","He rose and came towards the decanters, and stood beside her: a rather squat, stout man with white head, silent with misgiving."
"传来一阵虹吸管的嘶嘶声，然后他们又回到各自的椅子上。","There was the fizz of the syphon: then they came to their chairs."
"“阿诺德已经和您说过了吧，妈妈？”弗吉尼娅说道。","“Arnault has spoken to you, Mother?” said Virginia."
"博多恩太太直挺挺地坐了起来，两只猫头鹰般的大眼睛凶狠地瞪着弗吉尼娅。","Mrs Bodoin sat up straight, and gazed at Virginia with big, owlish eyes, haggard."
"弗吉尼娅很海派，但却感到一丝兴奋。","Virginia was terrified, yet a little thrilled."
"她母亲被击垮了。","Her mother was beaten."
"“是真的吗，弗吉尼娅？你愿意嫁给这个——东方绅士，是吗？”博多恩太太缓慢地问道。","“Is it true, Virginia, that you are willing to marry this—oriental gentleman?” asked Mrs Bodoin slowly."
"“是的，妈妈，一点儿没错。”弗吉尼娅用温和而带着调侃的声音说道。","“Yes, Mother, quite true,” said Virginia, in her teasing soft voice."
"博多恩太太一脸严肃，愕然不知所措。","Mrs Bodoin looked owlish and dazed."
"“我是否可以不和这事有任何关系？或者说不与你未来的丈夫有任何关系——我指的是不和他有任何生意上的交易？”她迷惑地问道，声音缓慢而清晰。","“May I be excused from having any part in it, or from having anything to do with your future husband—I mean having any business to transact with him?” she asked dazedly, in her slow, distinct voice."
"“噢，当然！”惊恐之下的弗吉尼娅古怪地笑着说道。","“Why, of course!” said Virginia, frightened, smiling oddly."
"接着又是一阵沉默。","There was a pause."
"随后感觉苍老而憔悴的博多恩太太再一次振作起来。","Then Mrs Bodoin, feeling old and haggard, pulled herself together again."
"“我是否可以理解为你未来的丈夫想占有这套公寓？”她说道。","“Am I to understand that your future husband would like to possess this apartment?” came her voice."
"突然，弗吉尼娅邪恶地笑了笑。","Virginia smiled quickly and crookedly."
"阿诺德只是屁股被钉住了似的坐着、听着。","Arnault just sat, planted on his posterior, and heard."
"她信赖他。","She reposed on him."
"“咳——也许吧！”弗吉尼娅说，","“Well—perhaps!” said Virginia."
"“也许他想确认一下我拥有这套公寓。”","“Perhaps he would like to know that I possessed it.”"
"她看着他。","She looked at him."
"阿诺德郑重地点点头。","Arnault nodded gravely."
"“那么你想占有它吗？”传来博多恩太太缓慢的声音，","“And do you wish to possess it?” came Mrs Bodoin’s slow voice."
"“和你丈夫一起占有它，这是不是你的意图？”","“If it your intention to inhabit it, with your husband?”"
"她拉长声音，一字一顿地说道。","She put eternities into her long, stressed words."
"“是的，我想是的。”弗吉尼娅说，","“Yes, I think it is,” said Virginia."
"“你知道你曾经说过这公寓是我的，妈妈。”","“You know you said the apartment was mine, Mother.”"
"“好吧！","“Very well!"
"它应该是你的。","It shall be so."
"如果你在我的书桌上留下书面要求，我会让我的律师来找这位——东方绅士。","I shall send my lawyer to this—oriental gentleman, if you will leave written instructions on my writing-table."
"我能问问你们考虑什么时候——结婚？”","May I ask when you think of getting—married?”"
"“你打算什么时候，阿诺德？”弗吉尼娅说。","“When do you think, Arnault?” said Virginia."
"“两周以后，可以吗？”他说着坐直了身子，拳头放在膝盖上。","“Shall it be, in two weeks?” he said, sitting erect, with his fists on his knees."
"“大概两周之后，妈妈。”弗吉尼娅说。","“In about a fortnight, Mother,” said Virginia."
"“我听到了！","“I have heard!"
"两周以后！","In two weeks!"
"好吧！","Very well!"
"两个星期之后，所有东西都任你支配。","In two weeks everything shall be at your disposal."
"那么现在，失陪了。”","And now, please excuse me.”"
"她站起身，照例微微地鞠了一躬，平静而缓慢地走出了房间。","She rose, made a slight general bow, and moved calmly and dimly from the room."
"她不能高声叫喊，也不能把那个黎凡特人逐出家门，这真是要了她的命。","It was killing her, that she could not shriek aloud and beat that Levantine out of the house."
"可是她不能这样。","But she couldn’t."
"她努力地控制住了自己。","She had imposed the restraint on herself."
"阿诺德站着，两眼放光，环视着房间。","Arnault stood and looked with glistening eyes round the room."
"它就要变成他的了。","It would be his."
"当他的儿子们来到英国时，他将在这里接待他们。","When his sons came to England, here he would receive them."
"他看着弗吉尼娅。","He looked at Virginia."
"她现在也是面色苍白又憔悴。","She too was white and haggard, now."
"然后她从他身边躲开了，好像充满了憎恶似的。","And she hung away from him, as if in resentment."
"她憎恶将自己的母亲打败。","She resented the defeat of her mother."
"她现在仍然可以永远地抛弃他，再回到母亲的身边。","She was still capable of dismissing him for ever, and going back to her mother."
"“你母亲是个了不起的女人。”他说着便走向弗吉尼娅，握住她的手，","“Your mother is a wonderful lady,” he said, going to Virginia and taking her hand."
"“可是她是不幸的，没有丈夫来保护她。","“But she has no husband to shelter her, she is unfortunate."
"她将会孤苦零丁，对此我感到很难过。","I am sorry she will be alone."
"若是她愿意同我们一起住在这里，我会很高兴的。”","I should be happy if she would like to stay here with us.”"
"这狡猾的老狐狸知道自己在做什么。","The sly old fox knew what he was about."
"“恐怕那个是没有希望的。”弗吉尼娅用她先前的那种嘲弄的语气说道。","“I’m afraid there’s no hope of that,” said Virginia, with a return to her old irony."
"她坐在沙发上，而他则像父亲般温柔地爱抚着她，这极不协调的场景就发生在她母亲的客厅里，这让她感到好笑。","She sat on the couch, and he caressed her softly and paternally, and the very incongruity of it, there in her mother’s drawing-room, amused her."
"他看到客厅里的东西既美观又值钱，并且现在这些都是他的了，为此，他热血沸腾，充满激情地爱抚着身边这个瘦小的姑娘，因为，她代表着周围这些贵重的东西并让它们为他所拥有。","And because he saw that the things in the drawing-room were handsome and valuable, and now they were his, his blood flushed and he caressed the thin girl at his side with passion, because she represented these valuable surroundings, and brought them to his possession."
"他说：“和我在一起，你将过得很惬意，很满足，哦，我会让你心满意足的，绝不会像你母亲那样。","And he said: “And with me you will be very comfortable, very content, oh, I shall make you content, not like Madame your mother."
"你会丰满起来，像玫瑰一样绽放。","And you will get fatter, and bloom like the rose."
"我会让你像玫瑰一样绽放。","I shall make you bloom like the rose."
"我们定在下星期，怎么样？","And shall we say next week, hein?"
"下星期，下周三，咱们结婚，怎么样？","Shall it be next week, next Wednesday, that we marry?"
"星期三是个好日子。","Wednesday is a good day."
"那天可以吗？”","Shall it be then?”"
"“很好！”弗吉尼娅说，又一次的爱抚使她感受到命运奢华的安排，命数已定，之后的一生中都不用再努力了。","“Very well!” said Virginia, caressed again into a luxurious sense of destiny, reposing on fate, having to make no effort, no more effort, all her life."
"博多恩太太第二天就搬进了一家旅馆，而且必定是趁弗吉尼娅不在的时候才回到公寓去整理行装，解救自己和她目前拥有的那些私人物品。","Mrs Bodoin moved into an hotel next day, and came into the apartment to pack up and extricate herself and her immediate personal belongings only when Virginia was necessarily absent."
"她和她女儿只在必要时才通过书信联系。","She and her daughter communicated by letter, as far as was necessary."
"然后接下来的五天时间里，博多恩太太头脑清醒。所有该处理的事情都处理了，她所有的行李箱都搬走了。","And in five days’ time Mrs Bodoin was clear.All business that could be settled was settled, all her trunks were removed."
"她有五个行李箱，那就是她的所有家当了。","She had five trunks, and that was all."
"财产被剥夺，也无家可归，她不得不动身去巴黎度过她的余生了。","Denuded and outcast, she would depart to Paris, to live out the rest of her days."
"最后一天，她在客厅里等着，一直等到弗吉尼娅回家。","The last day, she waited in the drawing-room till Virginia should come home."
"她坐在那里，戴着帽子，穿着出行服装，就像一个陌生人。","She sat there in her hat and street things, like a stranger."
"“我只是等着和你说声再见。”她说，","“I just waited to say good-bye,” she said."
"“我明天上午就动身去巴黎。","“I leave in the morning for Paris."
"这是我的地址。","This is my address."
"我想一切事情都已经处理好了，如果还有没办妥的，通知我，我会安排的。","I think everything is settled; if not, let me know and I’ll attend to it."
"好吧，再见了！——我希望你过得非常幸福！”","Well, good-bye!—and I hope you’ll be very happy!”"
"她带着恶意地吐出最后几个字，这让开始失去方向的弗吉尼娅恢复了理智。","She dragged out the last words sinisterly; which restored Virginia, who was beginning to lose her head."
"“噢，我想我会的。”弗吉尼娅说着，嘴角露出了扭曲的笑容。","“Why, I think I may be,” said Virginia, with the twist of a smile."
"“我不该感到惊讶。”博多恩太太尖刻而阴沉地说，","“I shouldn’t wonder,” said Mrs Bodoin pointedly and grimly."
"“我想那位亚美尼亚老爷爷非常清楚他在做什么。","“I think the Armenian grandpapa knows very well what he’s about."
"归根结底，你只是个妾而已。”","You’re just the harem type, after all.”"
"这些话缓缓说出，字字掷地有声，充满强烈的鄙视！","The words came slowly, dropping, each with a plop! Of deep contempt."
"“我想我是！","“I suppose I am!"
"非常有趣！”弗吉尼娅说。","Rather fun!” said Virginia."
"“可我想知道我是从哪儿学会这一点的？","“But I wonder where I got it?"
"不会是从你那儿，妈妈——”她拉长调子戏谑地说道。","Not from you, Mother—” she drawled mischievously."
"“我想不是。”","“I should say not.”"
"“可能女儿们就像梦一样，都是朝相反的方向发展。”弗吉尼娅带着恶意若有所思地说道，","“Perhaps daughters go by contraries, like dreams,” mused Virginia wickedly."
"“所有的小妾都与你无关，所以可能都只能我来当了。”","“All the harem was left out of you, so perhaps it all had to be put back into me.”"
"博多恩太太瞥了她一眼。","Mrs Bodoin flashed a look at her."
"“你让我非常同情！”她说。","“You have all my pity!” she said."
"“谢谢你，亲爱的。","“Thank you, dear."
"你却只得到我一丁点儿的同情。”","You have just a bit of mine.”"
