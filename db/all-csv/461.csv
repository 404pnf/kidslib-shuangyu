"一个纽约人的成长","The Making of a New Yorker"
"作者：欧·亨利","by O. Henry"
"除了拥有其他的特长，拉格斯还是位诗人。人们叫他流浪汉；但那仅仅是对他是一位哲学家、一位艺术家、一个旅行者、一个自然主义者以及一位发现者的省略说法。不过他首先是位诗人。他一生中从没有写过一行诗；但他过着诗的生活。要是把他的漂泊之旅写下来，那将会是一首五行打油诗。但是就我们这里谈论的主题而言，我们是说他是位诗人。","Besides many other things, Raggles was a poet.He was called a tramp; but that was only an elliptical way of saying that he was a philosopher, an artist, a traveller, a naturalist and a discoverer.But most of all he was a poet.In all his life he never wrote a line of verse; he lived his poetry.His Odyssey would have been a Limerick, had it been written.But, to linger with the primary proposition, Raggles was a poet."
"要是强迫拉格斯去写东西，他的专长会是写城市十四行诗。他研究城市，就如同女人研究镜子中的自己，如同儿童研究一个结构变位了的玩偶的粘胶和锯屑，如同记述野生动物的人研究动物园里的兽笼一般。对于格拉斯来说，城市不只是砖头和灰浆的堆砌，也不仅仅是有一定数量的居民的居住地；城市有独特明确的灵魂；它是一盘与众不同的生命大杂烩，有着自己特殊的本质、味道和感觉。怀着诗人的热情，拉格斯朝东西南北漫游了两千英里，将那些城市都装入了自己的心里。他在灰尘飞扬的道路上徒步行走，或者在货车上高贵地快速前进，根本不考虑时间。当他找到一个城市的心脏，聆听完它秘密的供述之后，他就会毫不停歇地继续向另一个城市漫游。菲克尔·拉格斯！——但也许他还没有遇到能吸引他产生批判性的幻想并保持这种幻想的市政当局。","Raggles’s specialty, had he been driven to ink and paper, would have been sonnets to the cities.He studied cities as women study their reflections in mirrors; as children study the glue and sawdust of a dislocated doll; as the men who write about wild animals study the cages in the zoo.A city to Raggles was not merely a pile of bricks and mortar, peopled by a certain number of inhabitants; it was a thing with a soul characteristic and distinct; an individual conglomeration of life, with its own peculiar essence, flavor and feeling.Two thousand miles to the north and south, east and west, Raggles wandered in poetic fervor, taking the cities to his breast.He footed it on dusty roads, or sped magnificently in freight cars, counting time as of no account.And when he had found the heart of a city and listened to its secret confession, he strayed on, restless, to another.Fickle Raggles!—but perhaps he had not met the civic corporation that could engage and hold his critical fancy."
"我们从古代诗人那里了解到，城市是阴性的。诗人拉格斯也认同这一点；他的脑海中有一个具体而清晰的形象，这形象象征和代表着他追逐过的每一个城市。","Through the ancient poets we have learned that the cities are feminine.So they were to poet Raggles; and his mind carried a concrete and clear conception of the figure that symbolized and typified each one that he had wooed."
"芝加哥似乎带着帕廷顿夫人那令人愉悦的建议、长羽毛和广藿香，迅速降落到了拉格斯面前，它以歌颂未来誓约的高亢而美丽的歌声，扰乱了他的平静。但是拉格斯还是会清醒过来，察觉到一种冷得发抖的感觉，意识到一直萦绕于脑际的理想迷失在了令人沮丧的土豆色拉和鱼的气味中。","Chicago seemed to swoop down upon him with a breezy suggestion of Mrs. Partington, plumes and patchouli, and to disturb his rest with a soaring and beautiful song of future promise.But Raggles would awake to a sense of shivering cold and a haunting impression of ideals lost in a depressing aura of potato salad and fish."
"就这样，芝加哥影响了他。也许描述有些模糊，有些偏差，但那是拉格斯的错。他本应该将自己的感触写在诗里，发表在杂志上。","Thus Chicago affected him.Perhaps there is a vagueness and inaccuracy in the description; but that is Raggles’s fault.He should have recorded his sensations in magazine poems."
"匹兹堡给他留下的印象，如同在一个火车站里，一群多克斯塔德的游吟诗人用俄语表演的《奥赛罗》。匹兹堡就像一位高贵慷慨的女士——尽管她为人朴实，热情，有着红彤彤的脸庞，洗碗时穿着丝绸裙子和白色的小山羊皮拖鞋，吩咐拉格斯在烧旺的火炉旁坐下，一边喝着香槟，一边啃着猪脚吃着炸土豆。","Pittsburg impressed him as the play of “Othello” performed in the Russian language in a railroad station by Dockstader’s minstrels.A royal and generous lady this Pittsburg, though—homely, hearty, with flushed face, washing the dishes in a silk dress and white kid slippers, and bidding Raggles sit before the roaring fireplace and drink champagne with his pigs’ feet and fried potatoes."
"新奥尔良从阳台上单纯地凝视着他。他可以看到她深思的明眸，看到她的扇子在扇动，仅此而已。他和她面对面只有一次。那是黎明时分，当时她正用一桶水冲洗人行道上的红砖。她笑着，哼着小曲，把拉格斯的鞋子里灌满了冰冷的水。算了吧！","New Orleans had simply gazed down upon him from a balcony.He could see her pensive, starry eyes and catch the flutter of her fan, and that was all.Only once he came face to face with her.It was at dawn, when she was flushing the red bricks of the banquette with a pail of water.She laughed and hummed a chansonette and filled Raggles’s shoes with ice-cold water.Allons!"
"波士顿则以一种飘忽不定的奇特方式向诗人拉格斯诠释了自己。波士顿对于他，就好像他喝了冰茶，这座城市是一块冰冷的白布，紧紧地缠住他的额头，激励着他做出未知却巨大的精神上的努力。终于，他开始铲雪以谋生计；头上的布开始变湿，使上面的结变得越来越紧，紧得解不开。","Boston construed herself to the poetic Raggles in an erratic and singular way.It seemed to him that he had drunk cold tea and that the city was a white, cold cloth that had been bound tightly around his brow to spur him to some unknown but tremendous mental effort.And, after all, he came to shovel snow for a livelihood; and the cloth, becoming wet, tightened its knots and could not be removed."
"你可能会说，这些都是含糊且难以理解的想法。但是你的这种不赞同的意见应该以感激来缓和，因为这些全是诗人的幻想——假设你突然从诗中感受到了这些。","Indefinite and unintelligible ideas, you will say; but your disapprobation should be tempered with gratitude, for these are poets’ fancies—and suppose you had come upon them in verse!"
"一天，拉格斯来到了大城市曼哈顿，百般努力，想赢得她的心。在所有城市中，她是最伟大的；他想在一定程度上了解她的音符，品味她，鉴赏她，将她分类，加以解释，并为她贴上标签，把她和那些将自己的个性秘密展示给他的其他城市安排在一起。在这里，我们不再当拉格斯的翻译员，而是变成了他的记录者。","One day Raggles came and laid siege to the heart of the great city of Manhattan.She was the greatest of all; and he wanted to learn her note in the scale; to taste and appraise and classify and solve and label her and arrange her with the other cities that had given him up the secret of their individuality.And here we cease to be Raggles’s translator and become his chronicler."
"一天早上，拉格斯乘着渡轮上岸，走向市中心，带着一副世界公民的厌世的神情。他刻意把自己打扮成一位“身份不明之人”。他不属于任何国籍、种族、阶级、集团、工会联盟和党派，也不属于任何保龄球协会。他的衣服虽然是由身高不同但胸围尺寸相同的公民捐赠给他的，但是不会像那些由带着手提箱、穿着吊带裤、拿着丝手帕，还戴着额外珍珠饰品的横跨大陆的裁缝们量身定做后送过来的衣服那样令人感觉不舒服。没有钱——诗人正应如此——但是怀着如天文学家在银河系发现了新星，或者是一个人看见墨汁突然从钢笔中流出后所具有的激情，拉格斯信步走进了这座大城市。","Raggles landed from a ferry-boat one morning and walked into the core of the town with the blasé air of a cosmopolite.He was dressed with care to play the role of an “unidentified man.”No country, race, class, clique, union, party clan or bowling association could have claimed him.His clothing, which had been donated to him piece-meal by citizens of different height, but same number of inches around the heart, was not yet as uncomfortable to his figure as those speciments of raiment, self-measured, that are railroaded to you by transcontinental tailors with a suit case, suspenders, silk handkerchief and pearl studs as a bonus.Without money—as a poet should be—but with the ardor of an astronomer discovering a new star in the chorus of the milky way, or a man who has seen ink suddenly flow from his fountain pen, Raggles wandered into the great city."
"下午晚些时候，他从喧嚣混乱中抽身出来，脸上带着一副无言的恐惧表情。他被打败了，他感到迷惑、窘迫和害怕。对他而言，其他城市就像要读的长长的初级课本，就像很快就能被看透的乡村姑娘，就像需要解答的蕴含着答案和捐赠额的画谜，就像咽牡蛎鸡尾酒一样；但这座城市，冰冷，发亮，宁静，就像橱窗里的一颗四克拉的钻戒，即使情人对着它，将衣袋里被卷成了一卷的工资捏出了汗，它也还是可望不可及。","Late in the afternoon he drew out of the roar and commotion with a look of dumb terror on his countenance.He was defeated, puzzled, discomfited, frightened.Other cities had been to him as long primer to read; as country maidens quickly to fathom; as send-price-of-subscription-with-answer rebuses to solve; as oyster cocktails to swallow; but here was one as cold, glittering, serene, impossible as a four-carat diamond in a window to a lover outside fingering damply in his pocket his ribbon-counter salary."
"其他他了解的城市的问候带着朴实的友善，人类尽有的粗放的仁慈，友好的诅咒，喋喋不休的好奇以及容易发觉的轻信或冷漠。曼哈顿这座城市没有给予他任何提示；它对他是封闭的。它就像一条固执的河流，在街上流过他的身旁。没有一只眼睛转向他；也没有任何人和他说话。他心里渴望匹兹堡那些被煤弄脏的手拍打他的肩膀，渴望芝加哥在他耳边恐吓着但又属于社交性质的喊叫，渴望波士顿那透过镜片投来的暗淡但慈善的凝视——甚至渴望路易斯维尔或圣路易斯那突如其来但并无恶意的靴尖。","The greetings of the other cities he had known—their homespun kindliness, their human gamut of rough charity, friendly curses, garrulous curiosity and easily estimated credulity or indifference.This city of Manhattan gave him no clue; it was walled against him.Like a river of adamant it flowed past him in the streets.Never an eye was turned upon him; no voice spoke to him.His heart yearned for the clap of Pittsburg’s sooty hand on his shoulder; for Chicago’s menacing but social yawp in his ear; for the pale and eleemosynary stare through the Bostonian eyeglass—even for the precipitate but unmalicious boot-toe of Louisville or St. Louis."
"站在百老汇，成功地追求了许多城市的拉格斯，就像个害羞的乡村情郎。他第一次深切地感受到了被忽视的屈辱感。当他试图将这座辉煌的、快速变化而又冰冷的城市纳入一个公式时，他彻底失败了。尽管他是位诗人，但它没有给他彩色的明喻，没有给他对比点，在磨光的表面，没有给他任何缺陷，没有给他任何他所熟悉且加以蔑视的其他城市那样的把手，可以让他握住，并能让他打量它的形状和结构。这些房子如层层壁垒，布满了防御的枪眼；市民是愉快但无生气的幽灵，随着阴险且自私的人群涌动。","On Broadway Raggles, successful suitor of many cities, stood, bashful, like any country swain.For the first time he experienced the poignant humiliation of being ignored.And when he tried to reduce this brilliant, swiftly changing, ice-cold city to a formula he failed utterly.Poet though he was, it offered him no color similes, no points of comparison, no flaw in its polished facets, no handle by which he could hold it up and view its shape and structure, as he familiarly and often contemptuously had done with other towns.The houses were interminable ramparts loopholed for defense; the people were bright but bloodless spectres passing in sinister and selfish array."
"在拉格斯灵魂中那个份量最重且阻碍他诗人幻想的就是完全的以自我为中心的精神，人们似乎饱含这种精神，正如玩具上满是涂的漆一样。他认为，每一个城市看起来都像是一个可恶、傲慢而自大的怪物。人性已经远离了它们；尽管它们十分渴望忘记同胞心中不可磨灭的偶像形象，但它们却是石头和涂料的蹒跚学步的影子，崇拜着自己。它们缺乏感情，冷酷，毫不宽容，麻木，被雕刻成了相同的样子。它们匆忙行走，就如因奇迹而产生的雕像在移动，而灵魂和感情依然在顽抗的大理石中沉睡。","The thing that weighed heaviest on Raggles’s soul and clogged his poet’s fancy was the spirit of absolute egotism that seemed to saturate the people as toys are saturated with paint.Each one that he considered appeared a monster of abominable and insolent conceit.Humanity was gone from them; they were toddling idols of stone and varnish, worshipping themselves and greedy for though oblivious of worship from their fellow graven images.Frozen, cruel, implacable, impervious, cut to an identical pattern, they hurried on their ways like statues brought by some miracles to motion, while soul and feeling lay unaroused in the reluctant marble."
"渐渐地，拉格斯注意到了一些特定的类型。一种类型是年长的绅士，留着雪白的短胡须，脸色红润，长着一双尖锐的蓝眼睛，穿得像阔气青年一样时髦，看起来像是城市的财富、老练和冷漠的化身。另一种这是一位女性，高挑，漂亮，清晰得如钢版印刷品一样，像女神一样，镇静，穿戴像古代的公主，眼睛发蓝光，目光如冰川上发射的阳光一样冰冷。第三种类型则是这座城市的附产物，提线木偶——一位胸襟开阔、昂首阔步、严厉、邪恶但沉着的人。他的下颌垂肉如丰收的麦地一样大，面色如受过洗礼的婴儿，指关节跟职业拳击手的一样。这种类型依靠着雪茄广告牌，傲慢地冷眼看着这个世界。","Gradually Raggles became conscious of certain types.One was an elderly gentleman with a snow-white, short beard, pink, unwrinkled face and stony, sharp blue eyes, attired in the fashion of a gilded youth, who seemed to personify the city’s wealth, ripeness and frigid unconcern.Another type was a woman, tall, beautiful, clear as a steel engraving, goddess-like, calm, clothed like the princesses of old, with eyes as coldly blue as the reflection of sunlight on a glacier.And another was a by-product of this town of marionettes—a broad, swaggering, grim, threateningly sedate fellow, with a jowl as large as a harvested wheat field, the complexion of a baptized infant and the knuckles of a prize-fighter.This type leaned against cigar signs and viewed the world with frappéd contumely."
"诗人是敏感的生物，拉格斯很快就在难以揣测的严峻环境中束手无策了。这座城市的表情寒冷，难以琢磨，具有讽刺意味，难以理解，怪异，而且冷酷，使他感到沮丧和迷惑。难道它没有心吗？木材堆，一脸尖酸相的家庭主妇们站在后门的责骂，外省酒保在免费午餐柜台后的善意的怨愤，下乡警察友善的粗暴，踢打，拘捕以及其他粗俗的、喧闹的、简陋的城市里的幸运机会等都比这个冷酷无情的城市好。","A poet is a sensitive creature, and Raggles soon shrivelled in the bleak embrace of the undecipherable.The chill, sphinx-like, ironical, illegible, unnatural, ruthless expression of the city left him downcast and bewildered.Had it no heart?Better the woodpile, the scolding of vinegar-faced housewives at back doors, the kindly spleen of bartenders behind provincial free-lunch counters, the amiable truculence of rural constables, the kicks, arrests and happy-go-lucky chances of the other vulgar, loud, crude cities than this freezing heartlessness."
"拉格斯鼓起自己的勇气，从平民大众那里寻找施舍。但是他们没有留意他，也不理会他，继续前行，眼睛都不眨一下，没有这样以示他们意识到了他的存在。那个时候拉格斯对自己说，曼哈顿，这个美丽却无情的城市是没有灵魂的；这里的居民就是人体模型，受着金属线和弹簧的操控；在这片广袤的荒原中，他是孤独的。","Raggles summoned his courage and sought alms from the populace.Unheeding, regardless, they passed on without the wink of an eyelash to testify that they were conscious of his existence.And then he said to himself that this fair but pitiless city of Manhattan was without a soul; that its inhabitants were manikins moved by wires and springs, and that he was alone in a great wilderness."
"拉格斯开始穿越马路。在轰鸣声、咆哮声、嘶嘶声和碰撞声中，什么东西碰倒了他，他被扔到了离原来的地方六码之外的地方。当他像火箭筒一样跌落到地面时，地球和所有的城市随之都成了破碎的梦。","Raggles started to cross the street.There was a blast, a roar, a hissing and a crash as something struck him and hurled him over and over six yards from where he had been.As he was coming down like the stick of a rocket the earth and all the cities thereof turned to a fractured dream."
"拉格斯睁开了眼睛。首先，他闻到了一种香味——一种天堂里初春的花香。然后他感受到了一只手触摸他的额头，柔软如落花。向他俯身的是那位穿得像古代公主的妇女，蓝色的眼睛温柔湿润，充满了人类的同情心。他的头枕在人行道上的丝绸手帕和毛皮衣物上。象征着城市财富和老练的那位老绅士，站着，手上拿着拉格斯的帽子。由于强烈地斥责他鲁莽的驾驶，他的脸更红了。从附近的咖啡馆里匆忙走出来的是那个长着硕大颈垂肉和婴儿面容的城市附产物。他手拿一满杯深红色的饮料，暗示着令人愉悦的潜在价值。","Raggles opened his eyes.First an odor made itself known to him—an odor of the earliest spring flowers of Paradise.And then a hand soft as a falling petal touched his brow.Bending over him was the woman clothed like the princess of old, with blue eyes, now soft and humid with human sympathy.Under his head on the pavement were silks and furs.With Raggles’s hat in his hand and with his face pinker than ever from a vehement burst of oratory against reckless driving, stood the elderly gentleman who personified the city’s wealth and ripeness.From a nearby café hurried the by-product with the vast jowl and baby complexion, bearing a glass full of a crimson fluid that suggested delightful possibilities."
"“喝吧，朋友。”附产物说。他将杯子拿到拉格斯的嘴边。","“Drink dis, sport,” said the by-product, holding the glass to Raggles’s lips."
"没过多大一会儿，数百人聚集在他周围，他们脸上露出深切关心的神情。两位讨人喜欢的帅气的警察走进人群中，把过多的好心人往后赶。一位披着黑披肩的老妇人，大声谈起了樟脑；一个报童悄悄地在拉格斯的肘下放了一张报纸，他的胳膊肘落在了泥泞的人行道上。一个活泼的青年人拿着一个笔记本，正在询问着名字。","Hundreds of people huddled around in a moment, their faces wearing the deepest concern.Two flattering and gorgeous policemen got into the circle and pressed back the overplus of Samaritans.An old lady in a black shawl spoke loudly of camphor; a newsboy slipped one of his papers beneath Raggles’s elbow, where it lay on the muddy pavement.A brisk young man with a notebook was asking for names."
"铃声叮当地紧急响起，一辆救护车从人群中开出一条路来。一位沉着冷静的外科医生挤进了人群中。","A bell clanged importantly, and the ambulance cleaned a lane through the crowd.A cool surgeon slipped into the midst of affairs."
"“老先生，感觉如何？”医生弯身问道。穿着丝绸缎衣服的公主用香喷喷的丝手帕擦去了拉格斯额头上一两滴血。","“How do you feel, old man?” asked the surgeon, stooping easily to his task.The princess of silks and satins wiped a red drop or two from Raggles’s brow with a fragrant cobweb."
"“我？”拉格斯说，脸上带着纯洁的笑容，“我感觉很好。”","“Me?” said Raggles, with a seraphic smile, “I feel fine.”"
"他找到了这个新城市的心脏。","He had found the heart of his new city."
"这三天，他们让他躺在医院的康复病房里的小床上。当医护人员听到争吵声时，他已经在那里呆了一个小时了。在调查中，他们发现拉格斯攻击并伤害了他的病友——一个怒视的过客，因为货物列车碰撞而被临时送到这里治疗。","In three days they let him leave his cot for the convalescent ward in the hospital.He had been in there an hour when the attendants heard sounds of conflict.Upon investigation they found that Raggles had assaulted and damaged a brother convalescent—a glowering transient whom a freight train collision had sent in to be patched up."
"护士长询问道：“怎么回事？”","“What’s all this about?” inquired the head nurse."
"“他骂我的老家。”拉格斯说。","“He was runnin’ down me town,” said Raggles."
"护士问：“老家在哪儿？”","“What town?” asked the nurse."
"拉格斯回答道：“纽约。”","“Noo York,” said Raggles."
