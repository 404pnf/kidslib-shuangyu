"聪明的格蕾特尔","Clever Grethel"
"从前有一个女厨子叫格蕾特尔，她穿着红色玫瑰花饰的鞋子，每当她穿着它们出门的时候，她就转过来转过去，心里想：“你真是个美丽的女孩！”当她回到家里，心里一高兴，就要喝上一口。由于喝的酒激起了她的食欲，她就把自己做得最好的饭菜吃了，直到酒足饭饱，说道：“厨师必须得要知道自己做的食物是什么味道的。”","There was once a cook named Grethel, who wore shoes with red rosettes, and when she walked out with them on, she turned herself this way and that, and thought, “You certainly are a pretty girl!”And when she came home she drank, in her gladness of heart, a draught of wine, and as wine excites a desire to eat, she tasted the best of whatever she was cooking until she was satisfied, and said, “The cook must know what the food is like.”"
"后来，有一天主人对她说：“格蕾特尔，今天晚上有个客人要来；给我准备两只可口的鸡。”“我会照办的，主人。”格蕾特尔回答道。她杀了两只鸡，用开水烫了，把毛拔了，然后串到烤肉叉上，快到晚上的时候把它们放到火上烤。两只鸡开始变成棕色，基本上快烤好了，但是客人还没有到。于是，格蕾特尔向她的主人喊道：“如果客人还不来，我就必须把鸡从火上拿开了，但是现在鸡烤得恰到好处，油都冒出来了，如果不马上吃了，真是太可惜了，简直是罪孽啊。”主人说：“我这就跑去把客人请来。”主人刚转身走开，格蕾特尔就把烤肉叉和鸡从火上取下来，心里想：“我在火边站了这么久，真是又热又渴，谁知道他们什么时候才能回来？这个时候，我一定要去酒窖里喝一口。”她跑过去，拿起一罐酒说：“上帝会保佑你喝了它的，格蕾特尔。”说完喝了一大口，又痛痛快快地喝了另外一大口。","It came to pass that the master one day said to her, “Grethel, there is a guest coming this evening; prepare me two fowls very daintily.”“I will see to it, master,” answered Grethel.She killed two fowls, scalded them, plucked them, put them on the spit, and towards evening set them before the fire, that they might roast.The fowls began to turn brown, and were nearly ready, but the guest had not yet arrived.Then Grethel called out to her master, “If the guest does not come, I must take the fowls away from the fire, but it will be a sin and a shame if they are not eaten directly, when they are juiciest.”The master said, “I will run myself, and fetch the guest.”When the master had turned his back, Grethel laid the spit with the fowls on one side, and thought, “Standing so long by the fire there, makes one hot and thirsty; who knows when they will come?Meanwhile, I will run into the cellar, and take a drink.”She ran down, set a jug, said, “God bless it to thy use, Grethel,” and took a good drink, and took yet another hearty draught."
"然后，她再次把鸡放到火上，涂上油脂，高兴地把肉叉翻来翻去。但是，烤鸡的味道实在是太香了，格蕾特尔想：“可能还缺点佐料，应该尝尝！”她用手指碰了碰，说：“啊！多好的鸡啊！现在不马上吃了，真是可惜，是罪过！”她跑到窗户那儿，看看主人和客人是不是到了，但是她没看见一个人，就跑回到烤鸡那里，心想：“一只翅膀快烤焦了！我最好把它取下来，吃了。”因此她就把它切下来，享用了，吃完后她想：“另外一个也要弄下来，不然主人一定会发现少了点什么。”当她把两只翅膀都吃了，就跑去找她的主人，还是没有看见他。突然，她想到：“谁会知道？他们可能根本不会来了，去别的地方了。”然后，她说：“喂，格蕾特尔，好好吃吧，一只鸡已经切掉了两个翅膀，再喝一杯，把它都吃了；都吃了你才会心安一些，怎么能糟蹋上帝的礼物呢？”因此，她又跑进酒窖，喝了一大杯，兴高采烈地吃了一只鸡。当一只鸡被她吞进肚之后，她的主人还是没有回来，格蕾特尔看着另外一只鸡说：“那只鸡去了哪里，另外一只也应该跟着去，两只鸡应该一起。那只鸡怎么处理了，这只鸡也该怎么处理；我想如果我再喝上一口也没什么坏处。”因此，她又痛痛快快地喝了一大口，让第二只鸡去和第一只鸡团圆了。","Then she went and put the fowls down again to the fire, basted them, and drove the spit merrily round.But as the roast meat smelt so good, Grethel thought, “Something might be wrong, it ought to be tasted!”She touched it with her finger, and said, “Ah!how good fowls are!It certainly is a sin and a shame that they are not eaten directly!”She ran to the window, to see if the master was not coming with his guest, but she saw no one, and went back to the fowls and thought, “One of the wings is burning!I had better take it off and eat it.”So she cut it off, ate it, and enjoyed it, and when she had done, she thought, “the other must go down too, or else master will observe that something is missing.”When the two wings were eaten, she went and looked for her master, and did not see him.It suddenly occurred to her, “Who knows?They are perhaps not coming at all, and have turned in somewhere.”Then she said, “Hallo, Grethel, enjoy yourself, one fowl has been cut into, take another drink, and eat it up entirely; when it is eaten you will have some peace, why should God’s good gifts be spoilt?”So she ran into the cellar again, took an enormous drink and ate up the one chicken in great glee.When one of the chickens was swallowed down, and still her master did not come, Grethel looked at the other and said, “Where one is, the other should be likewise, the two go together; what’s right for the one is right for the other; I think if I were to take another draught it would do me no harm.”So she took another hearty drink, and let the second chicken rejoin the first."
"她正吃得津津有味的时候，主人回来了，喊道：“快点儿，格蕾特尔，你快点儿，客人马上就到了！”“是的，主人，我马上就弄好。”格蕾特尔答道。同时，主人留心看看桌子已经布置好了，然后把切鸡用的大刀拿出来，去台阶上磨刀了。不一会儿，客人来了，亲切而又有礼貌地敲敲门。格蕾特尔跑去看是谁来了，当她看到是客人来了时，她把手指头竖在唇前，说：“嘘！嘘！赶紧逃跑吧，如果我的主人抓到你，你就惨了；他一定是说邀请你吃晚饭的吧，但是实际上他是想割掉你的两只耳朵。听听他这不是磨刀呢吗！”客人听到了磨刀声，慌忙地跑下台阶。格蕾特尔也没有耽搁；她尖叫着跑向主人，喊道：“你邀请来的贵客！”“啊，怎么啦，格蕾特尔？你说这话什么意思？”“是的，”她说，“他把我要端上来的鸡从盘子上抢走，拿着它们跑了！”“怎么会有这种事！”她的主人说，然后为可口的鸡感到惋惜。“如果他留一只给我，让我尝尝就好了。”他叫他停下来，但是客人装作没有听到。于是，他在后面追赶，手里拿着刀，喊着：“就要一只，就要一只。”意思是说客人应该留给他一只鸡，不要把两只都拿走。然而，客人想肯定是让他留下一只耳朵，跑得飞快像是火要烧到他了，带着两只耳朵回家去了。","While she was just in the best of the eating, her master came and cried, hurry up, “Haste thee, Grethel, the guest is coming directly after me!”“Yes, sir, I will soon serve up,” answered Grethel.Meantime the master looked to see that the table was properly laid, and took the great knife, wherewith he was going to carve the chickens, and sharpened it on the steps.Presently the guest came, and knocked politely and courteously at the house-door.Grethel ran, and looked to see who was there, and when she saw the guest, she put her finger to her lips and said, “Hush!hush!get away as quickly as you can, if my master catches you it will be the worse for you; he certainly did ask you to supper, but his intention is to cut off your two ears.Just listen how he is sharpening the knife for it!”The guest heard the sharpening, and hurried down the steps again as fast as he could.Grethel was not idle; she ran screaming to her master, and cried, “You have invited a fine guest!”“Eh, why, Grethel?What do you mean by that?”“Yes,” said she, “he has taken the chickens which I was just going to serve up, off the dish, and has run away with them!”“That’s a nice trick!” said her master, and lamented the fine chickens.“If he had but left me one, so that something remained for me to eat.”He called to him to stop, but the guest pretended not to hear.Then he ran after him with the knife still in his hand, crying, “Just one, just one,” meaning that the guest should leave him just one chicken, and not take both.The guest, however, thought no otherwise than that he was to give up one of his ears, and ran as if fire were burning under him, in order to take them both home with him."
"聪明的汉斯","Clever Hans"
"汉斯的妈妈说：“汉斯，你去哪里？”汉斯回答：“我去格蕾特尔家。”“表现好点儿，汉斯。”“噢，我会好好表现的。再见，妈妈。”“再见，汉斯。”汉斯来到格蕾特尔家：“你好，格蕾特尔。”“你好，汉斯。你带什么好东西来了吗？”“我什么都没带，我还想有人给我点什么呢。”格蕾特尔送给汉斯一根针。汉斯说：“再见，格蕾特尔。”“再见，汉斯。”","The mother of Hans said, “Whither away, Hans?”Hans answered, “To Grethel.”“Behave well, Hans.”“Oh, I’ll behave well.Good-bye, mother.”“Good-bye, Hans.”Hans comes to Grethel, “Good day, Grethel.”“Good day, Hans.What dost thou bring that is good?”“I bring nothing, I want to have something given me.”Grethel presents Hans with a needle.Hans says, “Good-bye, Grethel.”“Good-bye, Hans.”"

"弗雷德里克和凯瑟琳","Frederick and Catherine"
"很久以前，有个小伙子叫弗雷德里克，他娶了个老婆叫凯瑟琳，小两口新婚不久。一天，弗雷德里克对妻子说：“凯瑟琳，我要去耕田了，你务必准备些烤肉和新鲜啤酒放在桌上，等我回来，到时候我会又渴又饿。”“放心去吧，弗雷德里克，”凯瑟琳说，“放心去吧！我会准备好的。”临近午饭的时候，凯瑟琳从烟囱里取出一段香肠，扔进煎锅，和着黄油，一道放在炉火上煎。香肠开始煎得滋滋作响，凯瑟琳在一旁握着锅把，走起神来。她心想：“香肠还要再煎一会儿呢，何不趁现在去地窖打啤酒呢？”于是她把煎锅稳稳地放在火上，抓起酒罐就跑到地窖里去打酒。看着啤酒流入酒罐，她又猛然想到：“糟啦！楼上的狗没拴好，它肯定要把我的香肠叼走。还好我想到了！”她马上冲出地窖，但是绒毛狗已经叼起香肠，一路拖着香肠跑了。但是手忙脚乱的凯瑟琳拔腿就去追赶那条狗，一直撵到庄稼地里；那条狗呢，跑得比她快，并不想轻易结束它的香肠之旅，而是叼着香肠跨过了犁沟。“算了吧！”凯瑟琳只好往回走。因为刚才跑得太猛，累得不轻，她就慢慢悠悠地往回走，好让自己喘口气。就在这时，地窖里的啤酒还在从酒桶里往外流，因为她刚才忘了关龙头就跑出去了。于是啤酒灌满酒壶之后，就溢了出来，流到地窖里，直到整桶都漏光了。凯瑟琳一踏上地窖的楼梯，就看见了那灾难性的一幕。“我的老天哪！”她大叫道，“可别让弗雷德里克看见了！”她想了一会，猛然记起，上次赶集买的一袋精面粉还搁在阁楼上，可以拿来撒在啤酒上。“就是嘛，”她嘟囔着，“平时攒点什么，关键时候还真用得着呢！”她爬上阁楼，把面粉扛下来，往地窖里一扔，正好把那个酒罐给打翻了，给弗雷德里克备好的啤酒也洒在地窖里。“这倒好，”凯瑟琳说，“倒霉事全扎堆了！”她将整袋面粉全撒在地上。撒完之后，凯瑟琳兴奋地看着自己的杰作，高兴地说：“这儿看上去多干净整洁啊！”中午，弗雷德里克回家吃饭了：“嘿，老婆，做什么好吃的给我啦？”“唉，亲爱的，”妻子答道，“刚才，我锅里正给你煎着香肠呢，但是在去地窖给你打酒的时候，狗把香肠从锅里叼走了，我就去追狗，这时啤酒还流完了，我只有拿面粉来吸干地上的酒，又把你的酒罐碰翻了！不过你别担心，地窖里已经干啦！”弗雷德里克说道：“凯特啊凯特，你怎么能做这种傻事呢？竟然让狗叼走了香肠，啤酒还流光了，最后还搭上一袋子面粉！”“是啊，弗雷德里克，我不知道该怎么办。你早该教我的！”男人心想：“要是我老婆这么笨，那我以后可得看紧点儿了。”弗雷德里克以前攒下了许多银币，这时他全部兑换成了金币，然后对凯瑟琳说：“你看，这些都是赌博用的筹码；现在我把它们装进罐子里，埋在牛圈的食槽下面，你可千万别去碰，否则会惹麻烦的！”妻子回答道：“放心吧，我才不会碰它呢！”弗雷德里克出门后，几个卖盆盆罐罐的小贩子来到村里，见到这个年轻媳妇，就问她要不要买点什么。“唉，先生们，”凯瑟琳说，“我手里可没钱，买不了什么，可是我有一些黄铜筹码，你们愿意收的话，我就可以买你们的东西了。”“黄铜筹码？好啊！但是就给我们看看吧！”“那你们自己去牛圈的食槽下面挖吧，黄铜筹码就埋在那儿。我是不能过去的。”那些刁滑的小贩就走过去，在牛圈里挖出了那些金币。他们一拿到金币，就撇下那些盆盆罐罐，赶紧溜了。凯瑟琳心里想着要怎么用这些新东西，厨房里可什么都不缺，最后她把这些盆盆罐罐的底全部敲掉，一个个挂在屋外的篱笆上做装饰用。弗雷德里克回到家，看到篱笆上挂的那些新装饰，便问：“凯瑟琳，你这是干嘛呢？”“那些东西是我用你埋在牛圈下面的铜筹码买的。我可没过去，是那些小贩们自己去挖的。”“天哪，老婆呀，”弗雷德里克说，“瞧你都做了什么傻事啊！那些不是筹码，而是纯金币啊，是咱家的全部家当啊；你怎么能做这种事呢？”“是啊，老公，”妻子答道，“我不知道嘛，你怎么不早说呢？”","There was once on a time a man who was called Frederick and a woman called Catherine, who had married each other and lived together as young married folks.One day Frederick said, “I will now go and plough, Catherine; when I come back, there must be some roast meat on the table for hunger, and a fresh draught for thirst.”“Just go, Frederick,” answered Kate, “just go, I will have all ready for you.”Therefore when dinner-time drew near she got a sausage out of the chimney, put it in the frying-pan, put some butter to it, and set it on the fire.The sausage began to fry and to hiss, Catherine stood beside it and held the handle of the pan, and had her own thoughts as she was doing it.Then it occurred to her, “While the sausage is getting done thou couldst go into the cellar and draw beer.”So she set the frying-pan safely on the fire, took a can, and went down into the cellar to draw beer.The beer ran into the can and Kate watched it, and then she thought, “Oh, dear!The dog upstairs is not fastened up, it might get the sausage out of the pan.Well thought of.”And in a trice she was up the cellar-steps again, but the Spitz had the sausage in its mouth already, and trailed it away on the ground.But Catherine, who was not idle, set out after it, and chased it a long way into the field; the dog, however, was swifter than Catherine and did not let the sausage journey easily, but skipped over the furrows with it.“What’s gone is gone!” said Kate, and turned round, and as she had run till she was weary, she walked quietly and comfortably, and cooled herself.During this time the beer was still running out of the cask, for Kate had not turned the tap.And when the can was full and there was no other place for it, it ran into the cellar and did not stop until the whole cask was empty.As soon as Kate was on the steps she saw the mischance.“Good gracious!” she cried.“What shall I do now to stop Frederick knowing it!”She thought for a while, and at last she remembered that up in the garret was still standing a sack of the finest wheat flour from the last fair, and she would fetch that down and strew it over the beer.“Yes,” said she, “he who saves a thing when he ought, has it afterwards when he needs it,” and she climbed up to the garret and carried the sack below, and threw it straight down on the can of beer, which she knocked over, and Frederick’s draught swam also in the cellar.“It is all right,” said Kate, “where the one is the other ought to be also,” and she strewed the meal over the whole cellar.When it was done she was heartily delighted with her work, and said, “How clean and wholesome it does look here!”At mid-day home came Frederick: “Now, wife, what have you ready for me?”“Ah, Freddy,” she answered, “I was frying a sausage for you, but whilst I was drawing the beer to drink with it, the dog took it away out of the pan, and whilst I was running after the dog, all the beer ran out, and whilst I was drying up the beer with the flour, I knocked over the can as well, but be easy, the cellar is quite dry again.”Said Frederick, “Kate, Kate, you should not have done that!to let the sausage be carried off and the beer run out of the cask, and throw out all our flour into the bargain!”“Indeed, Frederick, I did not know that, you should have told me.”The man thought, “If my wife is like this, I must look after things more.”Now he had got together a good number of thalers which he changed into gold, and said to Catherine, “Look, these are counters for playing games; I will put them in a pot and bury them in the stable under the cow’s manger, but mind you keep away from them, or it will be the worse for you.”Said she, “Oh, no, Frederick, I certainly will not go.”And when Frederick was gone some pedlars came into the village who had cheap earthen-bowls and pots, and asked the young woman if there was nothing she wanted to bargain with them for?“Oh, dear people,” said Catherine, “I have no money and can buy nothing, but if you have any use for yellow counters I will buy of you.”“Yellow counters, why not?But just let us see them.”“Then go into the stable and dig under the cow’s manger, and you will find the yellow counters.I am not allowed to go there.”The rogues went thither, dug and found pure gold.Then they laid hold of it, ran away, and left their pots and bowls behind in the house.Catherine though she must use her new things, and as she had no lack in the kitchen already without these, she knocked the bottom out of every pot, and set them all as ornaments on the paling which went round about the house.When Frederick came and saw the new decorations, he said, “Catherine, what have you been about?”“I have bought them, Frederick, for the counters which were under the cow’s manger.I did not go there myself, the pedlars had to dig them out for themselves.”“Ah, wife,” said Frederick, “what have you done?Those were not counters, but pure gold, and all our wealth; you should not have done that.”“Indeed, Frederick,” said she, “I did not know that, you should have forewarned me.”"
"凯瑟琳站着想了会儿，然后对丈夫说：“听着，弗雷德里克，我们现在出发去追那些窃贼吧，把那些金币都追回来。”“那么，好吧，”弗雷德里克说，“我们试试吧，带点黄油和奶酪，我们路上饿了可以吃。”“好的，弗雷德里克，我这就去拿。”他们就出发了，弗雷德里克走得快些，因而凯瑟琳就跟在他后面。“这倒方便我了，”凯瑟琳心想，“往回走的时候，我就走在他前面了。”凯瑟琳来到一座大山前，路两侧都是深深的车辙。“看看，”凯瑟琳心想，“过路的车把可怜的地碾破轧伤了，这条路再也不会像以前那么平整了。”满怀同情心的凯瑟琳拿出黄油，把车辙两侧都抹了一遍，这样车轮碾过之时便不会如此受伤了。当她弯腰做好事的时候，一片奶酪从口袋里掉出来，滚到下山去了。凯瑟琳自言自语道：“我好不容易爬上山了，可不愿意再下去了；就让另一片奶酪去喊它回来吧。”于是她掏出第二片奶酪，扔下山去。但等了半天，都没回来，她又扔下第三片，心里想：“也许它们不想独自一人走路，而是等着结伴而行呢。”“也许它们不想独自一人走路，而是等着结伴而行呢。”由于三片奶酪都有去无归，凯瑟琳又说：“真是搞不懂，是不是第三片迷路走错了，那我再派第四片去找！”不过第四片也没回来交差。凯瑟琳发火了，她掏出剩下的第五片和第六片也扔下山去。她守在那儿等着，但是许久还是不见奶酪回来，便又说：“你们可真有本事啊！派你们出去这么久都不回来！别以为我会一直等着你们！我得赶路了，你们自己来追我吧；你们可比我年轻，跑得比我还快！”凯瑟琳就继续赶路，发现弗雷德里克在前方等着她，因为他想吃点东西。“把你带的食物拿出来吧！”他说。她只给了他一块干面包。“不是还叫你带了奶酪和黄油吗？”丈夫问。“哦，亲爱的，”凯瑟琳答道，“我把黄油抹在车辙里了，奶酪嘛，马上就自己回来了。有一片跑下山去了，我就派剩下的去找它去了。”弗雷德里克感叹道：“凯瑟琳，你怎么能用黄油去擦车辙印，让奶酪滚下山去呢！”“是啊，弗雷德里克，你早该教我的嘛！”于是，他们只能一起嚼着干面包，突然弗雷德里克问道：“凯瑟琳，出发的时候，家门关好了没？”“没关啊，弗雷德里克，你怎么不早说啊？”“那你就回去把门关好，顺便再带点吃的，我们吃了好继续赶路。我就在这儿等着你啊！”凯瑟琳就返身回家，她想：“弗雷德里克是想要吃点别的吧？那他肯定不喜欢黄油和奶酪了，我就带包梨子干给他，再拿罐醋给他解渴。”出门的时候，她把上半边门的门闩插好了，然后拆下下半边门，扛在背上，她想，门都随身带着呢，房子这下绝对安全了。凯瑟琳慢条斯理地走着，心想：“这样就可以让弗雷德里克多休息会儿了。”等她终于赶上老公，对他说：“我把门都给你扛来了，弗雷德里克，现在你可以自己看着啦。”“噢，我的老天爷！”他惊叹，“瞧我娶了个多么精明的老婆啊！她竟然把上半边门拴好，下半边门拆了，这样什么东西都能进去了。唉，现在让你再送回去也晚了。但既然你自己扛来的，你还是自己扛着吧！”“那就我扛吧，弗雷德里克，不过梨子干和醋罐实在太沉了，我把它们挂在门上，让门来背它们吧！”","Catherine stood for a while and bethought to herself; then she said, “Listen, Frederick, we will soon get the gold back again, we will run after the thieves.”“Come, then,” said Frederick, “we will try it; but take with you some butter and cheese that we may have something to eat on the way.”“Yes, Frederick, I will take them.”They set out, and as Frederick was the better walker, Catherine followed him.“It is to my advantage,” thought she, “when we turn back I shall be a little way in advance.”Then she came to a hill where there were deep ruts on both sides of the road.“There one can see,” said Catherine, “how they have torn and skinned and galled the poor earth, it will never be whole again as long as it lives,” and in her heart’s compassion she took her butter and smeared the ruts right and left, that they might not be so hurt by the wheels, and as she was thus bending down in her charity, one of the cheeses rolled out of her pocket down the hill.Said Catherine, “I have made my way once up here, I will not go down again; another may run and fetch it back.”So she took another cheese and rolled it down.But the cheeses did not come back, so she let a third run down, thinking,“perhaps they are waiting for company, and do not like to walk alone.”“Perhaps they are waiting for company, and do not like to walk alone.”As all three stayed away she said, “I do not know what that can mean, but it may perhaps be that the third has not found the way, and has gone wrong, I will just send the fourth to call it.”But the fourth did no better than the third.Then Catherine was angry, and threw down the fifth and sixth as well, and these were her last.She remained standing for some time watching for their coming, but when they still did not come, she said, “Oh, you are good folks to send in search of death, you stay a fine long time away!Do you think I will wait any longer for you?I shall go my way, you may run after me; you have younger legs than I.”Catherine went on and found Frederick, who was standing waiting for her because he wanted something to eat.“Now just let us have what you have brought with you,” said he.She gave him the dry bread.“Where have you the butter and the cheeses?” asked the man.“Ah, Freddy,” said Catherine, “I smeared the cart-ruts with the butter and the cheeses will come soon; one ran away from me, so I sent the others after to call it.”Said Frederick, “You should not have done that, Catherine, to smear the butter on the road, and let the cheeses run down the hill!”“Really, Frederick, you should have told me.”Then they ate the dry bread together, and Frederick said, “Catherine, did you make the house safe when you came away?”“No, Frederick, you should have told me to do it before.”“Then go home again, and make the house safe before we go any farther, and bring with you something else to eat.I will wait here for you.”Catherine went back and thought, “Frederick wants something more to eat, he does not like butter and cheese, so I will take with me a handkerchief full of dried pears and a pitcher of vinegar for him to drink.”Then she bolted the upper half of the door fast, but unhinged the lower door, and took it on her back, believing that when she had placed the door in security the house must be well taken care of.Catherine took her time on the way, and thought, “Frederick will rest himself so much the longer.”When she had once reached him she said, “Here is the house-door for you, Frederick, and now you can take care of the house yourself.”“Oh, heavens,” said he, “what a wise wife I have!She takes the under-door off the hinges that everything may run in, and bolts the upper one.It is now too late to go back home again, but since you have brought the door here, you shall just carry it farther.”“I will carry the door, Frederick, but the dried pears and the vinegar-jug will be too heavy for me, I will hang them on the door, it may carry them.”"
"他们走进树林了，四处寻找窃贼的踪迹，可是一无所获。天黑下来的时候，他们爬上一棵大树，准备在上面过夜。然而，他们刚在树枝上坐下来，树下竟然出现了那几个窃贼。这些窃贼总是拿走本不该被拿走的东西，被他们看上的东西一定会失踪。他们就在弗雷德里克和凯瑟琳藏身那棵树下坐了下来，几人升起一堆火便准备分赃。弗雷德里克从大树的另一边悄悄溜下来，捡了一些石块。然后他又爬上树去，打算从上面扔石块下来，砸死他们。但是石块都砸偏了！那几个无赖嚷道：“天恐怕要亮了吧，冷杉果都被风刮下来了！”凯瑟琳背上还背着一扇门呢，有点扛不住了，她觉得都是梨子干的问题，便对老公说：“弗雷德里克，我得把梨子干丢了哈！”“不行！凯瑟琳，现在可不行！”他回答道，“这样会暴露我们的！”“唉，但是，弗雷德里克，我实在是撑不住啦！我被压得不行了！”“那么就扔吧，真是找死！”梨子干就从树枝间滚下去，树下的几个无赖听见声音，就说：“是树叶落下来了。”","And now they went into the forest, and sought the rogues, but did not find them.At length as it grew dark they climbed into a tree and resolved to spend the night there.Scarcely, however, had they sat down at the top of it than the rascals came thither who carry away with them what does not want to go, and find things before they are lost.They sat down under the very tree in which Frederick and Catherine were sitting, lighted a fire, and were about to share their booty.Frederick got down on the other side and collected some stones together.Then he climbed up again with them, and wished to throw them at the thieves and kill them.The stones, however, did not hit them, and the knaves cried, “It will soon be morning, the wind is shaking down the fir-apples.Catherine still had the door on her back, and as it pressed so heavily on her, she thought it was the fault of the dried pears, and said, “Frederick, I must throw the pears down.”“No, Catherine, not now,” he replied, “they might betray us.”“Oh, but, Frederick, I must!They weigh me down far too much.”“Do it, then, and be hanged!”Then the dried pears rolled down between the branches, and the rascals below said, “The leaves are falling.”"
"过了一会儿，门依然很重，凯瑟琳受不了了，说：“唉，弗雷德里克，我得把醋倒下去了！”“不行，凯瑟琳，会暴露我们的！”“哎呀，但是，弗雷德里克，我没办法，实在是受不了了，醋好重啊！””那就倒吧，真是找死！”然后凯瑟琳就把醋倒下去了，洒在那些盗贼身上。那几个家伙说：“开始下露水了啊。”最后，凯瑟琳实在扛不住了，说：“难道一直是门太沉了？弗雷德里克，我得把门扔掉才行啦！”“不行，凯瑟琳，会暴露我们的！”“哦，但是，弗雷德里克，我没办法。我扛不住了，门太重了！”“哦，不行，凯瑟琳，坚持住！”“哎呀，弗雷德里克，我实在坚持不住了！”“那就扔了吧！真是见鬼！”门板就轰隆一下摔下去了，下面的几个无赖吓得大喊：“魔鬼下树了啊！”他们四散而逃，吓得什么都忘了带走。第二天一早，夫妻两个溜下树来，找回所有丢失的金币，带回家去了。","A short time afterwards, as the door was still heavy, Catherine said, “Ah, Frederick, I must pour out the vinegar.”“No, Catherine, you must not, it might betray us.”“Ah, but, Frederick, I must, it weighs me down far too much.”“Then do it and be hanged!”So she emptied out the vinegar, and it besprinkled the robbers.They said amongst themselves, “The dew is already falling.”At length Catherine thought, “Can it really be the door which weighs me down so?” and said, “Frederick, I must throw the door down.”“No, not now, Catherine, it might discover us.”“Oh, but, Frederick, I must.It weighs me down far too much.”“Oh, no, Catherine, do hold it fast.”“Ah, Frederick, I am letting it fall!”“Let it go, then, in the devil’s name.”Then it fell down with a violent clatter, and the rascals below cried, “The devil is coming down the tree!” and they ran away and left everything behind them.Early next morning, when the two came down they found all their gold again, and carried it home."
"他们回到家后，弗雷德里克说：“凯瑟琳，从今往后，你也得好好干活了啊！”“好的，弗雷德里克，我会好好干的！我这就去地里收玉米去。”凯瑟琳来到地里，心里想：“收玉米之前是该先吃点东西，还是该睡一会儿呢？哦，我还是先吃点东西再说吧！”然后凯瑟琳就大吃起来，吃饱了又困了，她勉强支撑着去割麦子，半睡半醒之中把自己的衣服，包括围裙、外衣和连衣裙都当成麦子给割成碎片了。睡了很长时间之后，她醒来，看着自己半裸地站在那里，自言自语道：“这个人是我吗？哦，肯定不是啦！”这时天已经黑了，凯瑟琳跑回村里，敲着丈夫的窗户，大喊道：“弗雷德里克！”","When they were once more at home, Frederick said, “And now, Catherine, you, too, must be industrious and work.”“Yes, Frederick, I will soon do that, I will go into the field and cut corn.”When Catherine got into the field, she said to herself, “Shall I eat before I cut, or shall I sleep before I cut?Oh, I will eat first.”Then Catherine ate and eating made her sleepy, and she began to cut, and half in a dream cut all her clothes to pieces, her apron, her gown, and her shift.When Catherine awoke again after a long sleep she was standing there half-naked, and said to herself, “Is it I, or is it not I?Alas, it is not I.”In the meantime night came, and Catherine ran into the village, knocked at her husband’s window, and cried, “Frederick.”"
"“什么事？”“我想问问凯瑟琳在不在家啊？”“在呢，在呢，”弗雷德里克回答道，“她应该在床上睡觉吧！”","“What is the matter?”“I should very much like to know if Catherine is in?”“Yes, yes,” replied Frederick, “she must be in and asleep.”"
"凯瑟琳说道：“哦，那我已经回家了嘛。”说完她就跑了。","Said she, “‘Tis well, then I am certainly at home already,” and ran away."
"凯瑟琳走着走着，发现有几个小偷正准备偷人家东西呢。她走上去，对他们说：“我来给你们当帮手吧！”歹徒心想她熟悉这里的情况，就答应了。于是凯瑟琳走到几户人家门口，大声喊道：“好乡亲们，有什么好东西没？我们想来偷点东西！”小偷们吓了一跳，心想：“这不是坏事了嘛！”于是他们就想赶紧摆脱掉凯瑟琳。他们说：“村外的牧师家地里种着些萝卜。你去帮我们拔点回来吧。”于是凯瑟琳就来到牧师家的地里，开始拔萝卜，但是她拔了也懒得收。这时，一个人恰好路过，看见她，便停下脚步，心想，难道是魔鬼在拔萝卜？他赶紧跑到村里找到牧师，说：“牧师啊，有个魔鬼在你地里拔萝卜呢！”“天哪！”牧师回答道，“我有条腿瘸了，我不能出门，没法赶走它。”这个人说：“那我就背着你去吧！”说着，就背上牧师向地里跑去。他们来到地里，凯瑟琳这时刚好直起身来了。“天哪，是恶魔啊！”牧师吓得大叫，然后两个人撒腿就跑。牧师吓得不轻，他这个瘸腿的人，竟然比背他的那个健全人跑得还快呢！","Outside Catherine found some vagabonds who were going to steal.Then she went to them and said, “I will help you to steal.”The rascals thought that she knew the situation of the place, and were willing.Catherine went in front of the houses, and cried, “Good folks, have you anything?We want to steal.”The thieves thought to themselves, “That’s a fine way of doing things,” and wished themselves once more rid of Catherine.Then they said to her, “Outside the village the pastor has some turnips in the field.Go there and pull up some turnips for us.”Catherine went to the ground, and began to pull them up, but was so idle that she did not gather them together.Then a man came by, saw her, and stood still and thought that it was the devil who was thus rooting amongst the turnips.He ran away into the village to the pastor, and said, “Mr. Pastor, the devil is in your turnip-ground, rooting up turnips.”“Ah, heavens,” answered the pastor, “I have a lame foot, I cannot go out and drive him away.”Said the man, “Then I will carry you on my back,” and he carried him out on his back.And when they came to the ground, Catherine arose and stood up her full height.“Ah, the devil!” cried the pastor, and both hurried away, and in his great fright the pastor could run better with his lame foot than the man who had carried him on his back could do with his sound one."
"赌鬼汉塞尔","Gambling Hansel"
"很久以前有一个人，他整天除了赌博之外什么都不做，也正是这个原因，人们除了叫他“赌鬼汉塞尔”外，从没称呼过他别的。由于他从来没有停止过赌博，他把他的房子和所有财产都输光了。到了债主们要来收房子的前一天，上帝和圣彼得来了，请求晚上的时候在他家借宿。赌鬼汉塞尔说：“对我来说，你们可以留下来过夜，但是没有可供你们休息的床，也没有任何吃的东西。”于是上帝说他们只想借宿，他们可以自己买东西吃。赌鬼汉塞尔对此没有异议。圣彼得随即给了他三枚银币，说让他去面包店买些面包。然后赌鬼汉塞尔就去了，但是当他走到其他赌棍聚集在一起的房子时，尽管他们已经赢走了他所有的财物，他们仍然冲他叫嚷着，说道：“汉塞尔，快进来吧。”“哦，”他说道，“你们想把这三枚银币也赢走吗？”汉塞尔说完，他们却还不放他走。于是他就进去了，把那三枚银币也输光了。同时圣彼得和上帝正等着他，因为他很久没回来，他们就动身去找他。赌鬼汉塞尔看见他们走过来，就装作把钱掉进了水沟里，还在那里一直认真地找，但是上帝已经知道他在赌博时输掉了。圣彼得又给了他三枚银币，而且这次汉塞尔再也不让自己上别人的钩了，终于给上帝和圣彼得买回了面包。然后上帝问他有没有葡萄酒，他说，“哎呀，先生，酒桶都是空的！”但是上帝说让他下酒窖去看看，因为最好的酒仍旧在那儿。半天他都不信，但是最后他说：“好吧，我下去，但是我知道那里已经没有葡萄酒了。”然而，当他拧开塞子，瞧啊，上好的葡萄酒就流了出来！于是他把葡萄酒拿给他们，上帝和圣彼得就在那里过了夜。第二天一大早，上帝告诉赌鬼汉塞尔他可以提三个请求。上帝以为他会请求到天堂里；但是赌鬼汉塞尔请求要一副可以赢得一切的扑克牌，一个可以赢得一切的骰子，一棵生长着各种果实的树，爬上这棵树的人，只要赌鬼汉塞尔不让他下来，他就下不来。上帝满足了他所有的请求，和圣彼得离开了。","Once upon a time there was a man who did nothing but gamble, and for that reason people never called him anything but Gambling Hansel, and as he never ceased to gamble, he played away his house and all that he had.Now the very day before his creditors were to take his house from him, came the Lord and St. Peter, and asked him to give them shelter for the night.Then Gambling Hansel said, “For my part, you may stay the night, but I cannot give you a bed or anything to eat.”So the Lord said he was just to take them in, and they themselves would buy something to eat, to which Gambling Hansel made no objection.Thereupon St. Peter gave him three groschen, and said he was to go to the baker’s and fetch some bread.So Gambling Hansel went, but when he reached the house where the other gambling vagabonds were gathered together, they, although they had won all that he had, greeted him clamorously, and said, “Hansel, do come in.”“Oh,” said he, “do you want to win the three groschen too?”On this they would not let him go.So he went in, and played away the three groschen also.Meanwhile St. Peter and the Lord were waiting, and as he was so long in coming, they set out to meet him.When Gambling Hansel came, however, he pretended that the money had fallen into the gutter, and kept raking about in it all the while to find it, but our Lord already knew that he had lost it in play.St. Peter again gave him three groschen, and now he did not allow himself to be led away once more, but fetched them the loaf.Our Lord then inquired if he had no wine, and he said, “Alack, sir, the casks are all empty!”But the Lord said he was to go down into the cellar, for the best wine was still there.For a long time he would not believe this, but at length he said, “Well, I will go down, but I know that there is none there.”When he turned the tap, however, lo and behold, the best of wine ran out!So he took it to them, and the two passed the night there.Early next day our Lord told Gambling Hansel that he might beg three favours.The Lord expected that he would ask to go to Heaven; but Gambling Hansel asked for a pack of cards with which he could win everything, for dice with which he would win everything, and for a tree whereon every kind of fruit would grow, and from which no one who had climbed up, could descend until he bade him do so.The Lord gave him all that he had asked, and departed with St. Peter."
"现在赌鬼汉塞尔立即着手认真地赌博，不久以后他已经赢得了半个世界。圣彼得根据这个情况对上帝说：“上帝，这样的事情不能再继续下去了，他会赢得整个世界，而您会输掉整个世界。我们必须派死神去找他。”当死神出现的时候，赌鬼汉塞尔刚刚坐到赌桌前，然后死神说：“汉塞尔，出来一下。”但是赌鬼汉塞尔说：“等一小会儿，我把这局赌完，在这段时间里，你到外面那棵树上去，摘一些水果，我们可以在路上吃。”于是死神爬上了树，但是当他想要再下来的时候，他却下不来了。赌鬼汉塞尔让他在上面呆了七年，在这七年里没有人死去。","And now Gambling Hansel at once set about gambling in real earnest, and before long he had gained half the world.Upon this St. Peter said to the Lord, “Lord, this thing must not go on, he will win, and thou lose, the whole world.We must send Death to him.”When Death appeared, Gambling Hansel had just seated himself at the gaming-table, and Death said, “Hansel, come out a while.”But Gambling Hansel said, “Just wait a little until the game is done, and in the meantime get up into that tree out there, and gather a little fruit that we may have something to munch on our way.”Thereupon Death climbed up, but when he wanted to come down again, he could not, and Gambling Hansel left him up there for seven years, during which time no one died."
"因此圣彼得对上帝说：“上帝，这种情况不能再继续下去了。人们都不会死了；我们必须亲自去一趟。”于是他们亲自去了，上帝命令汉塞尔让死神下来。因此，汉塞尔立即去见死神，然后对他说：“下来吧。”，死神一下来就直接把他杀了。他们一起离开，来到了另一个世界，然后赌鬼汉塞尔直接走到天堂的门口，敲了敲门。“谁在那儿？”“赌鬼汉塞尔。”“啊，我们不收留他！走开！”他又走到了炼狱门口，再次敲门。“谁在那儿？”“赌鬼汉塞尔。”“啊，这里就算没有他也已经全是哭泣声、哀号声了。我们不想赌博，你走吧。”然后他到了地狱门前，这次他们收留了他。然而，只有老撒旦和那些扭曲的小鬼在家，他们一直都在世上作恶。汉塞尔一坐下就又赌起来。然而，撒旦除了奇形怪状的小鬼外，没有什么可输的，于是赌鬼汉塞尔把小鬼都赢了过来，因为他的扑克牌不会让他输。现在他再次出发，带着他那些歪歪扭扭的小鬼去了霍恩福特，拔起一根啤酒花藤支柱，带回去捅天，天堂开始噼噼啪啪地响。于是，圣彼得再次说道：“上帝，这种情况不能再继续下去了，我们必须让他进来，否则他会把我们从天堂里扔下去。”于是他们让他进去了。但是，赌鬼汉塞尔立即又开始赌了，噪音和骚乱声之大，他们都听不到自己在说什么。因此，圣彼得再次说道：“上帝，这种情况不能再继续下去了，我们必须把他扔出去，否则他会把整个天堂弄得天翻地覆的。”于是他们立即去找他，并把他扔了下去，他的灵魂摔成了碎片，进入了赌棍的体内，到了今天还活在世上。","So St. Peter said to the Lord, “Lord, this thing must not go on.People no longer die; we must go ourselves.”And they went themselves, and the Lord commanded Hansel to let Death come down.So Hansel went at once to Death and said to him, “Come down,” and Death took him directly and put an end to him.They went away together and came to the next world, and then Gambling Hansel made straight for the door of Heaven, and knocked at it.“Who is there?”“Gambling Hansel.”“Ah, we will have nothing to do with him!Begone!”So he went to the door of Purgatory, and knocked once more.“Who is there?”“Gambling Hansel.”“Ah, there is quite enough weeping and wailing here without him.We do not want to gamble, just go away again.”Then he went to the door of Hell, and there they let him in.There was, however, no one at home but old Lucifer and the crooked devils who had just been doing their evil work in the world.And no sooner was Hansel there than he sat down to gamble again.Lucifer, however, had nothing to lose, but his mis-shapen devils, and Gambling Hansel won them from him, as with his cards he could not fail to do.And now he was off again with his crooked devils, and they went to Hohenfuert and pulled up a hop-pole, and with it went to Heaven and began to thrust the pole against it, and Heaven began to crack.So again St. Peter said, “Lord, this thing cannot go on, we must let him in, or he will throw us down from Heaven.”And they let him in.But Gambling Hansel instantly began to play again, and there was such a noise and confusion that there was no hearing what they themselves were saying.Therefore St. Peter once more said, “Lord, this cannot go on, we must throw him down, or he will make all Heaven rebellious.”So they went to him at once, and threw him down, and his soul broke into fragments, and went into the gambling vagabonds who are living this very day."
"上帝的食物","God’s Food"
"从前有两姐妹，一个没有孩子，很富有，另一个生了五个孩子，是个寡妇，很穷，她和孩子们都已经没有吃的了。情急之下，她去她姐姐那儿，说：“我和我的孩子们都快饿死了，你那么富有，给我一口面包吧。”那个富姐姐心肠很硬，她说：“我自己家也没有吃的了。”然后对可怜的妹妹恶语相加，赶走了她。不久后，富姐姐的丈夫回到家，刚要给自己切片面包吃，但他第一刀刚切下去，鲜血就从面包中流了出来。他妻子看到后很是害怕，于是告诉了丈夫所发生的一切。他急忙离开，要去帮助寡妇和她的孩子们。可当他进屋后，发现寡妇在祈祷。她将两个最小的孩子搂在怀里，三个大一些的孩子躺在那儿，已经死了。他要给她食物，但她说：“我们不再需要俗世的食物了。上帝已经喂饱了三个孩子，我们的祈祷，上帝也同样会听见的。”她刚说完，两个最小的就断气了，随后她的心碎了，也倒下死去了。","There were once upon a time two sisters, one of whom had no children and was rich, and the other had five and was a widow, and so poor that she no longer had food enough to satisfy herself and her children.In her need, therefore, she went to her sister, and said, “My children and I are suffering the greatest hunger; thou art rich, give me a mouthful of bread.”The very rich sister was as hard as a stone, and said, “I myself have nothing in the house,” and drove away the poor creature with harsh words.After some time the husband of the rich sister came home, and was just going to cut himself a piece of bread, but when he made the first cut into the loaf, out flowed red blood.When the woman saw that she was terrified and told him what had occurred.He hurried away to help the widow and her children, but when he entered her room, he found her praying.She had her two youngest children in her arms, and the three eldest were lying dead.He offered her food, but she answered, “For earthly food have we no longer any desire.God has already satisfied the hunger of three of us, and he will hearken to our supplications likewise.”Scarcely had she uttered these words than the two little ones drew their last breath, whereupon her heart broke, and she sank down dead."
"汉斯娶妻","Hans Married"
"在很久很久以前，有一个叫汉斯的年轻农民，他的叔叔想给他找个有钱的妻子。因此，他让汉斯在火炉后面坐下，把火炉烧得非常热。然后他取出一罐牛奶和很多白面包，又递给他一枚崭新的、闪闪发光的法新（1/4便士），说道：“汉斯，握紧那枚法新，把白面包弄成碎屑放到牛奶里，然后你就呆在这儿，在我回来之前不要乱动。”“好的，”汉斯说，“我会照您的吩咐做的。”然后，求爱者穿上一条旧的补丁裤，去找邻村一个有钱农民的女儿，说道：“嫁给我的侄子汉斯怎么样——你将得到一个适合你的、诚实明智的男人？”贪婪的父亲问道，“他的财产如何？”他吃得起面包吗？”“亲爱的朋友，”求爱者回复道，“我那年轻的侄子有舒适的床，手里有相当多的钱，还有很多面包可以掰着吃，除此之外，他也和我一样，有好多块儿。”（他边说，边拍着他裤子上的补丁，但是在那个区域，小块儿地也叫做“补丁”。）“如果你不怕麻烦可以和我回家看看，你马上就会看到我说的情形。”然后守财奴不想失去这么好的机会，说道：“如果确实如此，我不会再反对这门婚事了。”","There was once upon a time a young peasant named Hans, whose uncle wanted to find him a rich wife.He therefore seated Hans behind the stove, and had it made very hot.Then he fetched a pot of milk and plenty of white bread, gave him a bright newly-coined farthing in his hand, and said, “Hans, hold that farthing fast, crumble the white bread into the milk, and stay where you are, and do not stir from that spot till I come back.”“Yes,” said Hans, “I will do all that.”Then the wooer put on a pair of old patched trousers, went to a rich peasant’s daughter in the next village, and said, “Won’t you marry my nephew Hans—you will get an honest and sensible man who will suit you?”The covetous father asked, “How is it with regard to his means?Has he bread to break?”“Dear friend,” replied the wooer, “my young nephew has a snug berth, a nice bit of money in hand, and plenty of bread to break, besides he has quite as many patches as I have,” (and as he spoke, he slapped the patches on his trousers, but in that district small pieces of land were called patches also.) “If you will give yourself the trouble to go home with me, you shall see at once that all is as I have said.”Then the miser did not want to lose this good opportunity, and said, “If that is the case, I have nothing further to say against the marriage.”"
"因此婚礼在约定的日期举行了，当年轻的妻子走出房门去看看新郎的财产时，汉斯脱下他最好的衣服，穿上他带补丁的长罩衫说道，“我怕弄坏了我的好衣服。”然后他们一起出去了，看到了一块庄稼地和一块草地的交界处，汉斯用手指着，然后拍着他长罩衫上的一块儿大补丁和一块儿小补丁说，“那块儿是我的，那块儿也是，亲爱的，看看吧，”他的意思是说让他的妻子不要盯着那宽阔的土地看，而是看他的衣服，衣服上的补丁才是他的。","So the wedding was celebrated on the appointed day, and when the young wife went out of doors to see the bridegroom’s property, Hans took off his Sunday coat and put on his patched smock-frock and said, “I might spoil my good coat.”Then together they went out and wherever a boundary line came in sight, or fields and meadows were divided from each other, Hans pointed with his finger and then slapped either a large or a small patch on his smock-frock, and said, “That patch is mine, and that too, my dearest, just look at it,” meaning thereby that his wife should not stare at the broad land, but look at his garment, which was his own."
"“你确实是在婚礼上？”“是的，我确实在那儿，冠带齐全。我的头饰是雪做的；然后太阳一出来，它就化了。我的外衣是蛛丝做的，我又不得不穿过一些荆棘，都挂坏了，我的鞋是玻璃做的，我碰到一个石头上了，听到，‘叮当’一声，成了两半。”","“Were you indeed at the wedding?”“Yes, indeed I was there, and in full dress.My head-dress was of snow; then the sun came out, and it was melted.My coat was of cobwebs, and I had to pass by some thorns which tore it off me, my shoes were of glass, and I pushed against a stone and they said, “Klink,” and broke in two."
"汉塞尔和格蕾特","Hansel and Grethel"
"在一个大森林附近，住着一个穷苦的砍柴人和他的妻子，还有他的两个孩子。儿子叫汉塞尔，女儿叫格蕾特。他们吃不起饭，日子过得很苦，有一年闹饥荒，家里连每天的口粮都没了。夜里，砍柴人躺在床上，想到眼前的困境，心里着急，辗转反侧，唉声叹气，他对妻子说：“我们该怎么办才好？我们自己都一无所有了，拿什么抚养我们苦命的孩子啊？”“老公，我告诉你怎么办，”妻子答道，“明天一早，我们就带孩子去森林最深处，在那儿点堆火，给孩子们各自留下一块面包，然后我们就去砍柴，把他们扔那儿不管了。他们肯定找不到回家的路，从今后我们就再也不用抚养他们了。”“不行，老婆，”男人说，“我做不到啊！我怎么能把自己的孩子遗弃在森林里呢？那些野兽很快就会发现他们，把他们撕碎的！”“哼，你这个蠢才！”妻子说，“那我们四个就都等着饿死吧！你这就去把棺材准备好吧。”妻子吵闹不休，男人别无他法，只得同意了。“但是我好心疼那两个苦命的孩子啊！”他哀叹道。","Hard by a great forest dwelt a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his two children.The boy was called Hansel and the girl Grethel.He had little to bite and to break, and once when great scarcity fell on the land, he could no longer procure daily bread.Now when he thought over this by night in his bed, and tossed about in his anxiety, he groaned and said to his wife, “What is to become of us?How are we to feed our poor children, when we no longer have anything even for ourselves?”“I’ll tell you what, husband,” answered the woman, “Early tomorrow morning we will take the children out into the forest to where it is the thickest, there we will light a fire for them, and give each of them one piece of bread more, and then we will go to our work and leave them alone.They will not find the way home again, and we shall be rid of them.”“No, wife,” said the man, “I will not do that; how can I bear to leave my children alone in the forest?—the wild animals would soon come and tear them to pieces.”“O, thou fool!” said she, “Then we must all four die of hunger, thou mayest as well plane the planks for our coffins,” and she left him no peace until he consented.“But I feel very sorry for the poor children, all the same,” said the man."
"那两个孩子也因为太饿而睡不着觉，就听到了继母和爸爸的谈话。格蕾特伤心地哭了，她对汉塞尔说：“现在一切都完了。”“别哭，格蕾特，”汉塞尔说，“不用难过！我自有办法！”等大人们都睡了，汉塞尔从床上爬起来，披上他的小外套，打开下面的门，悄悄地爬出去了。月光是多么地皎洁啊，照得屋前地上的白色鹅卵石像银币一般闪闪发亮。汉塞尔弯下腰，捡了许多小石子，把外套的小衣兜装得满满的。回去以后，他对格蕾特说：“妹妹，你就安心地睡吧！上帝不会不管我们的。”然后他上床继续睡了。天刚朦朦亮，太阳还没升起来呢，继母就来把两个孩子喊起来了：“快起床！两个懒骨头！今天我们要去森林里砍柴。“继母给了两个孩子每人一小片面包，对他们说：“这是你俩的晚餐，别一下子吃完了，那可就什么都没有了。”汉塞尔的衣兜里装满了小石头，所以格蕾特就接过了面包，装进自己的围裙里。他们一家人便一起向森林出发了。每走一小会儿，汉塞尔就会停下，一次又一次转身回望家的方向。父亲问：“汉塞尔，落在后面在看什么呢？你这是在做什么呢？快赶路啊。”“哦，爸爸，”汉塞尔回答道，“我在看我的小白猫呢，它正蹲在屋梁上看着我，想和我说再见。”继母说：“傻瓜，那不是你的小白猫，那是太阳照在烟囱上的反光呢。”然而汉塞尔不是在看什么小白猫，他每次转身都悄悄地把兜里的小石头一一撒在路上。","The two children had also not been able to sleep for hunger, and had heard what their step-mother had said to their father.Grethel wept bitter tears, and said to Hansel, “Now all is over with us.”“Be quiet, Grethel,” said Hansel, “do not distress thyself, I will soon find a way to help us.”And when the old folks had fallen asleep, he got up, put on his little coat, opened the door below, and crept outside.The moon shone brightly, and the white pebbles which lay in front of the house glittered like real silver pennies.Hansel stooped and put as many of them in the little pocket of his coat as he could possibly get in.Then he went back and said to Grethel, “Be comforted, dear little sister, and sleep in peace, God will not forsake us,” and he lay down again in his bed.When day dawned, but before the sun had risen, the woman came and awoke the two children, saying “Get up, you sluggards!we are going into the forest to fetch wood.”She gave each a little piece of bread, and said, “There is something for your dinner, but do not eat it up before then, for you will get nothing else.”Grethel took the bread under her apron, as Hansel had the stones in his pocket.Then they all set out together on the way to the forest.When they had walked a short time, Hansel stood still and peeped back at the house, and did so again and again.His father said, “Hansel, what art thou looking at there and staying behind for?Mind what thou art about, and do not forget how to use thy legs.”“Ah, father,” said Hansel, “I am looking at my little white cat, which is sitting up on the roof, and wants to say good-bye to me.”The wife said, “Fool, that is not thy little cat, that is the morning sun which is shining on the chimneys.”Hansel, however, had not been looking back at the cat, but had been constantly throwing one of the white pebble-stones out of his pocket on the road."
"终于走到森林深处了，父亲对孩子们说：“孩子们，去拾些柴禾，我来点堆火，免得冻着你们。”汉塞尔和格莱特捡来好多小树枝，堆得像座小山。火堆点燃了，烧得很旺。继母对孩子们说：“孩子们，你们先在这儿烤火休息一会儿，我和你们爸爸去森林那边砍点柴。我们干完了就回来接你们。”","When they had reached the middle of the forest, the father said, “Now, children, pile up some wood, and I will light a fire that you may not be cold.”Hansel and Grethel gathered brushwood together, as high as a little hill.The brushwood was lighted, and when the flames were burning very high, the woman said, “Now, children, lay yourselves down by the fire and rest, we will go into the forest and cut some wood.When we have done, we will come back and fetch you away.”"
"汉塞尔和格蕾特就坐在火堆边等着。中午的时候，他们饿了，就把那一小片面包吃了。他们相信父亲就在不远处，因为还能听得见砍柴的声音。然而，事实上，那不是砍柴的声音，是父亲绑在枯树上的一段树枝，随风荡来荡去，发出的声音。两个孩子就一直坐在那儿等啊等，等到两眼都困得睁不开了，就睡着了。最后醒来的时候， 已经是深夜了。格蕾特开始哭了，说道：“我们怎么才能走出森林啊？”但汉塞尔安慰妹妹说：“再等一会儿，月亮升起来后，我们很快就会找到回家的路了。”不久，圆月升起。汉塞尔牵着妹妹的手，一路顺着在月光下如银币般闪闪发亮的鹅卵石，找到了回家的路。","Hansel and Grethel sat by the fire, and when noon came, each ate a little piece of bread, and as they heard the strokes of the wood-axe they believed that their father was near.It was not, however, the axe, it was a branch which he had fastened to a withered tree which the wind was blowing backwards and forwards.And as they had been sitting such a long time, their eyes shut with fatigue, and they fell fast asleep.When at last they awoke, it was already dark night.Grethel began to cry and said, “How are we to get out of the forest now?”But Hansel comforted her and said, “Just wait a little, until the moon has risen, and then we will soon find the way.”And when the full moon had risen, Hansel took his little sister by the hand, and followed the pebbles which shone like newly-coined silver pieces, and showed them the way."
"他们走了整整一夜，第二天黎明时分才回到了父亲的家。他们敲了敲门，继母打开门，看见是他们，便说：“你们两个贪玩的小东西，怎么在森林里面睡了那么久呢？还以为你们不回来了呢！”可是爸爸非常高兴，他正为抛弃孩子们而心痛不已。","They walked the whole night long, and by break of day came once more to their father’s house.They knocked at the door, and when the woman opened it and saw that it was Hansel and Grethel, she said, “You naughty children, why have you slept so long in the forest?—we thought you were never coming back at all!”The father, however, rejoiced, for it had cut him to the heart to leave them behind alone."
"不久之后，各地又闹饥荒。一天夜里，孩子们又听见继母对父亲说：“没吃的了，只剩半条面包了，吃完就什么都没了。那两个孩子必须得丢掉，这次我们把他们扔到森林的更深处，免得他们又自己找回家来了。只能这样，要不我们就等死吧！”男人心里很沉重，他相信：为人父母，应与子女的分享最后的食物。可是妻子根本就不听他的，只是一味地责骂他。可是一次妥协就意味着永远的妥协，父亲已经让步了一次，也只能再次让步了。","Not long afterwards, there was once more great scarcity in all parts, and the children heard their mother saying at night to their father, “Everything is eaten again, we have one half loaf left, and after that there is an end.The children must go, we will take them farther into the wood, so that they will not find their way out again; there is no other means of saving ourselves!”The man’s heart was heavy, and he thought “it would be better for thee to share the last mouthful with thy children.”The woman, however, would listen to nothing that he had to say, but scolded and reproached him.He who says A must say B, likewise, and as he had yielded the first time, he had to do so a second time also."
"孩子们这次也没睡着，听到了继母和父亲的对话。等大人都睡了，汉塞尔又从床上爬起来，准备跟上次一样，出门捡些小石头做路标，可是，继母把门都锁死了，汉塞尔根本出不去。不过，他还是安慰妹妹，说：“别哭，格蕾特，安心地睡吧，好心的上帝会帮助我们的。”","The children were, however, still awake and had heard the conversation.When the old folks were asleep, Hansel again got up, and wanted to go out and pick up pebbles as he had done before, but the woman had locked the door, and Hansel could not get out.Nevertheless he comforted his little sister, and said, “Do not cry, Grethel, go to sleep quietly, the good God will help us.”"
"第二天一大早，继母来叫孩子们起床。她给了孩子们每人一小片面包，比上次的还小。在去森林路上，汉塞尔悄悄在口袋里把面包揉碎了，时不时地停下脚步，偷偷撒一点面包屑在路上。“汉塞尔，停下来东张西望地干什么呢？”父亲说，“快赶路吧！”“我看见我的小鸽子了，它就在屋顶上，好像在和我道别呢。”汉塞尔回答道。“傻瓜！”后母说，“那才不是你的小鸽子，是太阳照在烟囱上的反光呢。”然而，汉塞尔就这样一点一点地一路上撒着面包屑。","Early in the morning came the woman, and took the children out of their beds.Their bit of bread was given to them, but it was still smaller than the time before.On the way into the forest Hansel crumbled his in his pocket, and often stood still and threw a morsel on the ground.“Hansel, why dost thou stop and look round?” said the father, “go on.”“I am looking back at my little pigeon which is sitting on the roof, and wants to say good-bye to me,” answered Hansel.“Simpleton!” said the woman, “that is not thy little pigeon, that is the morning sun that is shining on the chimney.”Hansel, however, little by little, threw all the crumbs on the path."
"后母把孩子们带进比上次更远的森林深处，那是他们从未到过的地方。她在那儿又点燃一大堆火，对孩子们说：“坐好了，孩子们，累了就自己睡一觉。我们要去森林里砍柴了，晚上干完活就回来接你们。”中午，兄妹俩分吃着格蕾特的那点面包，因为汉塞尔的已经撒在路上做路标了。过了一会儿，他们睡着了，天渐渐黑了，一直都没有人来找这两个可怜的孩子。夜深了，他们才醒来。汉塞尔安慰妹妹道：“等着吧，格莱特，等月亮升起来，我们就看得见路上的面包屑了，我们就可以找到路回家了。”月亮升起来，两兄妹寻找面包屑。可是哪里还有面包屑啊？树林里、田野里成千上万的鸟儿早就把面包屑吃光了。汉塞尔对格蕾特说：“我们很快就可以找到回家的路了。”可事实是，他们找不到了。他们走啊走，走了一整夜，第二天又从天亮走到天黑，却走不出森林，孩子们早就饿得不行了，他们没有东西吃，只有地上长着的几个浆果。走到双腿发软了，实在走不动了，他们就躺在一棵树下睡着了。","The woman led the children still deeper into the forest, where they had never in their lives been before.Then a great fire was again made, and the mother said, “Just sit there, you children, and when you are tired you may sleep a little; we are going into the forest to cut wood, and in the evening when we are done, we will come and fetch you away.”When it was noon, Grethel shared her piece of bread with Hansel, who had scattered his by the way.Then they fell asleep and evening came and went, but no one came to the poor children.They did not awake until it was dark night, and Hansel comforted his little sister and said, “Just wait, Grethel, until the moon rises, and then we shall see the crumbs of bread which I have strewn about, they will show us our way home again.”When the moon came they set out, but they found no crumbs, for the many thousands of birds which fly about in the woods and fields had picked them all up.Hansel said to Grethel, “We shall soon find the way,” but they did not find it.They walked the whole night and all the next day too from morning till evening, but they did not get out of the forest, and were very hungry, for they had nothing to eat but two or three berries, which grew on the ground.And as they were so weary that their legs would carry them no longer, they lay down beneath a tree and fell asleep."
"这已经是离开父亲家以来的第三个早晨了。孩子们又继续往前走，但他们越走越深，要是再没有人帮助的话，他们会累死饿死的。正午时分，他们看见一只漂亮的小鸟正停在树枝上，浑身雪白，唱着悦耳的歌，兄妹俩不由得停下脚步，聆听起来。小鸟唱完，就扇着翅膀在他们前面飞起来了，兄妹俩一路跟过去，来到一座小屋子前。小鸟在屋顶落下，兄妹俩走近小屋，才发现小屋竟然是用面包砌的墙，蛋糕做的屋顶，晶莹透亮的糖果做的窗户！“现在我们有吃的了，”汉塞尔对妹妹说，“我们好好地大吃一顿吧！我想吃屋顶，格蕾特，你去尝尝窗子，肯定很甜很甜的。”汉塞尔够到顶上，掰下一小块屋顶，尝了尝；妹妹呢，靠在窗户上，一点一点地啃起来。突然，一个细微的声音从屋里传出来：","It was now three mornings since they had left their father’s house.They began to walk again, but they always got deeper into the forest, and if help did not come soon, they must die of hunger and weariness.When it was mid-day, they saw a beautiful snow-white bird sitting on a bough, which sang so delightfully that they stood still and listened to it.And when it had finished its song, it spread its wings and flew away before them, and they followed it until they reached a little house, on the roof of which it alighted; and when they came quite up to little house they saw that it was built of bread and covered with cakes, but that the windows were of clear sugar.“We will set to work on that,” said Hansel, “and have a good meal.I will eat a bit of the roof, and thou, Grethel, canst eat some of the window, it will taste sweet.”Hansel reached up above, and broke off a little of the roof to try how it tasted, and Grethel leant against the window and nibbled at the panes.Then a soft voice cried from the room,"
"“啃，啃，啃！是谁在啃我的小屋子啊？”","“Nibble, nibble, gnaw, Who is nibbling at my little house?”"
"孩子们回答道：","The children answered,"
"“是风，是风，是空中的风。”","“The wind, the wind, The heaven-born wind,”"
"孩子们继续吃，饥饿已经让他们什么都顾不上了。汉塞尔觉得屋顶的蛋糕真是太美味了，就掰下了一大块慢慢吃；格蕾特呢，干脆把整块圆玻璃都拆下来，坐下来慢慢吃。突然，门开了，一个老太太拄着拐棍，悄悄地走出来。汉塞尔和格蕾特见到她，吓了一跳，手里的吃的都掉到了地上。然而，老太太却笑着点了点头，说：“哦，可爱的孩子们，是谁把你们带到我这儿来的呢？进屋里来吧，就住我这儿。没有人会伤害你们的。”她拉起两个孩子的小手，把他们带进了屋。她拿出好多好吃的给孩子们吃，有牛奶、蛋糕、糖果、苹果，还有坚果。之后，她在两张漂亮的小床上铺上雪白的亚麻床单，让孩子们睡在上面，汉赛尔和格蕾特觉得简直像进了天堂一般。","and went on eating without disturbing themselves.Hansel, who thought the roof tasted very nice, tore down a great piece of it, and Grethel pushed out the whole of one round window-pane, sat down, and enjoyed herself with it.Suddenly the door opened, and a very, very old woman, who supported herself on crutches, came creeping out.Hansel and Grethel were so terribly frightened that they let fall what they had in their hands.The old woman, however, nodded her head, and said, “Oh, you dear children, who has brought you here?Do come in, and stay with me.No harm shall happen to you.”She took them both by the hand, and led them into her little house.Then good food was set before them, milk and pancakes, with sugar, apples, and nuts.Afterwards two pretty little beds were covered with clean white linen, and Hansel and Grethel lay down in them, and thought they were in heaven."
"其实，这位老太太的善心都是装出来的，她其实是个邪恶的巫婆，专门造了这座美味甜点的小屋子来引诱他们的。一旦有孩子落入她的圈套，她就会杀了他，然后煮了吃掉，对她来说，那可是值得庆祝的丰收之宴。巫婆长着红彤彤的眼睛，看不清远处，不过她们的嗅觉可跟野兽一样灵敏，每当有人类走进，她就闻得到。之前当汉塞尔和格蕾特出现在附近的时候，她就闻到了，她邪恶地笑着，阴险地说：“哈哈！他们是我的了，可逃不出我的手掌心！”第二天一早，孩子们还在熟睡之中，巫婆就起身了，她来到他们的床前，看着他们熟睡中肉嘟嘟、红彤彤的小脸蛋，自言自语道：“真是香喷喷的美味啊！”她用她干枯如树枝的手一把抓住汉塞尔，把他丢到一间小马圈里，关在了栅栏后。汉塞尔惊恐得大声叫喊，可是没有用。老巫婆来到格蕾特身旁，抓住她用力地摇醒，大声喊道：“起床了，懒东西，快去挑水，给你哥哥煮好吃的去，他现在在屋外的马圈里呢，要把他养得胖胖的。等他长肥了，我就吃了他。”格蕾特伤心地大哭起来，可是有什么用呢？她必须得照巫婆的命令去做。","The old woman had only pretended to be so kind; she was in reality a wicked witch, who lay in wait for children, and had only built the little house of bread in order to entice them there.When a child fell into her power, she killed it, cooked and ate it, and that was a feast day with her.Witches have red eyes, and cannot see far, but they have a keen scent like the beasts, and are aware when human beings draw near.When Hansel and Grethel came into her neighborhood, she laughed maliciously, and said mockingly, “I have them, they shall not escape me again!”Early in the morning before the children were awake, she was already up, and when she saw both of them sleeping and looking so pretty, with their plump red cheeks, she muttered to herself, “That will be a dainty mouthful!”Then she seized Hansel with her shrivelled hand, carried him into a little stable, and shut him in with a grated door.He might scream as he liked, that was of no use.Then she went to Grethel, shook her till she awoke, and cried, “Get up, lazy thing, fetch some water, and cook something good for thy brother, he is in the stable outside, and is to be made fat.When he is fat, I will eat him.”Grethel began to weep bitterly, but it was all in vain, she was forced to do what the wicked witch ordered her."
"于是，每天，汉塞尔都能吃到格蕾特做的可口的饭菜，可格蕾特只能吃点螃蟹壳充饥。每天早晨，老巫婆都会溜到小马圈，对汉塞尔喊道：“汉塞尔， 把你的手指头伸出来给我摸摸，看看你快长胖了没有。”汉塞尔呢，每次都伸出一只小骨头，老巫婆眼睛看不清楚，就以为真是他的手指，感到非常纳闷，搞不清楚怎么老是喂不肥他。四个星期过去了，汉塞尔的手指摸起来还是那么干枯，老巫婆不耐烦了，再也等不下去了。“嘿，格蕾特，”她对女孩嚷道，“跑快点，快去挑水！我可不管汉塞尔是胖是瘦，明天我一定要把他杀了吃了。”苦命的妹妹去挑水的时候，恸哭起来，泪水顺着脸颊流淌！她喊道：“亲爱的上帝，请救救我们吧！就算被林子里的野兽吞吃了，我们也能死在一起了。”“省省吧，”巫婆说，“谁也救不了你们。”","And now the best food was cooked for poor Hansel, but Grethel got nothing but crab-shells.Every morning the woman crept to the little stable, and cried, “Hansel, stretch out thy finger that I may feel if thou wilt soon be fat.”Hansel, however, stretched out a little bone to her, and the old woman, who had dim eyes, could not see it, and thought it was Hansel’s finger, and was astonished that there was no way of fattening him.When four weeks had gone by, and Hansel still continued thin, she was seized with impatience and would not wait any longer.“Hola, Grethel,” she cried to the girl, “be active, and bring some water.Let Hansel be fat or lean, to-morrow I will kill him, and cook him.”Ah, how the poor little sister did lament when she had to fetch the water, and how her tears did flow down over her cheeks!“Dear God, do help us,” she cried.“If the wild beasts in the forest had but devoured us, we should at any rate have died together.”“Just keep thy noise to thyself,” said the old woman, “all that won’t help thee at all.”"
"第二天一早，格蕾特就得起床，挑水，架锅，烧火。“我们先烤面包，”巫婆说，“我已经把炉子烧热了，面也揉好了。”她把可怜的格蕾特推到炉子跟前，炉子里的火苗已经窜出老高。“你给我爬进去！”巫婆命令道，“看看炉子是不是够热了，够热就把面包放进去。”老巫婆的如意算盘是：等格蕾特一爬进去，她就在外面把炉门关上，把她烤熟，然后就可以一道把她吃了。不过格蕾特可是完全看穿了巫婆的用心，说：“我不知道怎么爬进去，你是怎么进去的呢？”“真是个大笨蛋！”老巫婆说，“门足够大，看着，我这个老婆子都爬得进去！”老巫婆跪下来，把头伸了进去。格蕾特赶紧把老巫婆往炉子里用力一推，然后合上炉子门，插好炉闩。啊！老巫婆在炉子里凄惨地叫喊，但格蕾特却跑开了。邪恶的巫婆就这样被活活地烧死了。","Early in the morning, Grethel had to go out and hang up the cauldron with the water, and light the fire.“We will bake first,” said the old woman, “I have already heated the oven, and kneaded the dough.”She pushed poor Grethel out to the oven, from which flames of fire were already darting.“Creep in,” said the witch, “and see if it is properly heated, so that we can shut the bread in.”And when once Grethel was inside, she intended to shut the oven and let her bake in it, and then she would eat her, too.But Grethel saw what she had in her mind, and said, “I do not know how I am to do it; how do you get in?”“Silly goose,” said the old woman, “The door is big enough; just look, I can get in myself!” and she crept up and thrust her head into the oven.Then Grethel gave her a push that drove her far into it, and shut the iron door, and fastened the bolt.Oh! then she began to howl quite horribly, but Grethel ran away, and the godless witch was miserably burnt to death."
"这时，格蕾特飞也似的跑去找哥哥，打开马圈的门，喊道：“汉塞尔，我们得救了！老巫婆死了！”门一打开，汉塞尔就像只出笼的小鸟一样冲了出来。他们高兴地紧紧地拥抱着，又蹦又跳，开心地亲吻着彼此！因为他们已经不用再害怕那个老巫婆了，于是便回到那个小屋子，屋子里的每个角落都有成箱的金银珠宝。“这些比我们的小石子可好多了！”汉塞尔高兴地说，把衣兜塞得满满的。格蕾特说：“我也要带点东西回家。”也把围裙装满了宝贝。“现在我们可以走了，”汉塞尔说，“离开这个老巫婆的森林。”","Grethel, however, ran like lightning to Hansel, opened his little stable, and cried, “Hansel, we are saved!The old witch is dead!”Then Hansel sprang out like a bird from its cage when the door is opened for it.How they did rejoice and embrace each other, and dance about and kiss each other!And as they had no longer any need to fear her, they went into the witch’s house, and in every corner there stood chests full of pearls and jewels.“These are far better than pebbles!” said Hansel, and thrust into his pockets whatever could be got in, and Grethel said, “I, too, will take something home with me,” and filled her pinafore full.“But now we will go away.” said Hansel, “that we may get out of the witch’s forest.”"
"走啊走，走了两个钟头，他们来到一条大河边。“我们这样可过不去啊！”汉塞尔说，“没有踏板，也没有桥。”“也没有船，”格蕾特说，“不过你看，那边有只白色的鸭子在水里游着，我去求求它渡我们过河吧！”格蕾特对鸭子喊道：","When they had walked for two hours, they came to a great piece of water.“We cannot get over,” said Hansel, “I see no foot-plank, and no bridge.”“And no boat crosses either,” answered Grethel, “but a white duck is swimming there; if I ask her, she will help us over.”Then she cried,"
"“小鸭子，小鸭子，你看见我们了吗？汉塞尔和格蕾特正等着你呢。河上既没有踏板，也没有桥。","“Little duck, little duck, dost thou see, Hansel and Grethel are waiting for thee?There’s never a plank, or bridge in sight,"
"请用你洁白的背驮我们过河吧！”","Take us across on thy back so white.”"
"鸭子游过来，汉塞尔骑到了鸭子背上，让妹妹坐在他身旁。“不行，”格蕾特说，“我们两个一起坐太沉了，让小鸭子一个一个地送我们过去吧。”好心的小鸭子就这样把他们送过了岸。两兄妹渡过河继续前行，走了一小会儿，就发觉树林越看越熟悉了，最后，终于远远地望见了父亲的家。两个孩子高兴地奔跑起来 ，冲进家门，直扑进爸爸的怀里。爸爸自从把孩子们丢弃在森林里，就没开心过一天。而那个狠心的继母也过世了。格蕾特把兜里的珍珠玉石都倾倒出来，撒了一地；汉塞尔也从兜里大把大把地掏出珠宝来。从此，他们一家再无烦恼，生活得开开心心，无忧无虑。我的故事讲完了。看见那边有只大老鼠没？谁捉住它，就可以拿鼠皮做顶皮帽了。","The duck came to them, and Hansel seated himself on its back, and told his sister to sit by him.“No,” replied Grethel, “that will be too heavy for the little duck; she shall take us across, one after the other.”The good little duck did so, and when they were once safely across and had walked for a short time, the forest seemed to be more and more familiar to them, and at length they saw from afar their father’s house.Then they began to run, rushed into the parlour, and threw themselves into their father’s arms.The man had not known one happy hour since he had left the children in the forest; the woman, however, was dead.Grethel emptied her pinafore until pearls and precious stones ran about the room, and Hansel threw one handful after another out of his pocket to add to them.Then all anxiety was at an end, and they lived together in perfect happiness.My tale is done, there runs a mouse, whosoever catches it, may make himself a big fur cap out of it."
"克布斯先生","Herr Korbes"
"有一次，小公鸡和小母鸡想要一同旅行。于是，小公鸡造了一辆漂亮的马车，马车备有四个红色的车轮，由四只小老鼠拉着。小母鸡坐上马车，与小公鸡一起驾车出发了。不一会儿，他们遇到了一只猫，猫问道：“你们要去哪儿啊？”小公鸡回答说：“我们要去克布斯先生家。”猫说道：“带我一起去吧！”小公鸡说：“好呀，从后面上来吧，免得你从前面上来摔下去。千万要小心，别把我的红色小车轮弄脏了。亲爱的车轮们，往前滚动吧，亲爱的老鼠们，喊起你们的号子，我们接着往克布斯先生家走。”","There were once a cock and a hen who wanted to take a journey together.So the cock built a beautiful carriage, which had four red wheels, and harnessed four mice to it.The hen seated herself in it with the cock, and they drove away together.Not long afterwards they met a cat who said, “Where are you going?”The cock replied, “We are going to the house of Herr Korbes.”“Take me with you,” said the cat.The cock answered, “Most willingly, get up behind, lest you fall off in front.Take great care not to dirty my little red wheels.And you little wheels, roll on, and you little mice pipe out, as we go forth on our way to the house of Herr Korbes.”"
"后来它们又碰到一个磨盘、一个鸡蛋、一只鸭子、一根别针和一根缝衣针，大家都坐上了马车，前往克布斯家。不过，它们到克布斯先生家时，克布斯先生出去了。小老鼠们把马车拉进了谷仓，小母鸡和小公鸡飞上了栖木。猫坐在炉边，鸭子蹲到井架上。鸡蛋滚进了毛巾里，别针把自己钉在坐垫上，缝衣针跳上了床钻到了枕头中间，而磨盘则平躺着呆在门框上。克布斯先生回到家了。他走向了壁炉想要生火，猫扑了他一脸炭灰。他连忙跑进厨房洗脸，鸭子又把水溅了他一脸。他想要拿毛巾擦干，可鸡蛋滚到他脸上，碎了，把他的眼睛都糊住了。他想在椅子上歇一会，于是坐了下来，别针便扎了他一下。他气坏了，往床上一躺，可头刚落在枕头上，就被缝衣针扎了一下。他尖声大叫起来，怒气冲冲地想要跑出去，可刚到门口，磨盘就跳了下来，把他砸死了。克布斯先生一定是一个大坏蛋！","After this came a millstone, then an egg, then a duck, then a pin, and at last a needle, who all seated themselves in the carriage, and drove with them.When, however, they reached the house of Herr Korbes, Herr Korbes was not there.The mice drew the carriage into the barn, the hen flew with the cock upon a perch.The cat sat down by the hearth, the duck on the well-pole.The egg rolled itself into a towel, the pin stuck itself into the chair-cushion, the needle jumped on to the bed in the middle of the pillow, and the millstone laid itself over the door.Then Herr Korbes came home, went to the hearth, and was about to light the fire, when the cat threw a quantity of ashes in his face.He ran into the kitchen in a great hurry to wash it off, and the duck splashed some water in his face.He wanted to dry it with the towel, but the egg rolled up against him, broke, and glued up his eyes.He wanted to rest, and sat down in the chair, and then the pin pricked him.He fell in a passion, and threw himself on his bed, but as soon as he laid his head on the pillow, the needle pricked him, so that he screamed aloud, and was just going to run out into the wide world in his rage, but when he came to the house-door, the millstone leapt down and struck him dead.Herr Korbes must have been a very wicked man!"
"一只眼、两只眼和三只眼","One-eye, Two-eyes, and Three-eyes"
"从前，有个女人，她有三个女儿。大女儿只有一只眼睛，长在前额正中间，所以她叫一只眼。二女儿和普通人一样长着两只眼睛，所以她叫两只眼。小女儿有三只眼睛，她的第三只眼睛也长在前额的正中间，所以她叫三只眼。　　　然而，由于两只眼看东西和其他普通人一模一样，她的姐妹和妈妈都不能忍受她。她们对她说：“你长着两只眼，和那些普通人一样，你和我们不是一家人！”她们还任意摆布她，给她穿旧衣服，给她吃剩饭剩菜，并且还想方设法折磨她。有一天，两只眼的姐妹们只给她一点儿吃的，虽然她依然很饿，她们还让她去到田野里放羊。于是她坐在山丘上开始哭啊哭，哭得是那么伤心，她的眼泪像两条小河似的不断地从眼睛里往下淌。她悲伤地抬起头来时，发现一个女人站在她身边，这个女人问道：“可怜的两只眼，你为什么哭啊？”两只眼回答说：“叫我怎能不哭呢？因为我和普通人一样长着两只眼，我的姐妹和妈妈都讨厌我。她们对我任意摆布，只让我穿旧衣服，让我吃剩饭剩菜。今天她们给我吃的太少，现在我还是很饿！”那时，睿智的女人说道：“两只眼，擦掉你的眼泪，让我来告诉你一个好办法，你以后就不会再挨饿了。你只要对着你的羊说：","THERE was once a woman who had three daughters, the eldest of whom was called One-eye, because she had only one eye in the middle of her forehead, and the second, Two-eyes, because she had two eyes like other folks, and the youngest, Three-eyes, because she had three eyes; and her third eye was also in the centre of her forehead.However, as Two-eyes saw just as other human beings did, her sisters and her mother could not endure her.They said to her, “Thou, with thy two eyes, art no better than the common people; thou dost not belong to us!”They pushed her about, and threw old clothes to her, and gave her nothing to eat but what they left, and did everything that they could to make her unhappy.It came to pass that Two-eyes had to go out into the fields and tend the goat, but she was still quite hungry, because her sisters had given her so little to eat.So she sat down on a ridge and began to weep, and so bitterly that two streams ran down from her eyes.And once when she looked up in her grief, a woman was standing beside her, who said, “Why art thou weeping, little Two-eyes?”Two-Eyes answered, “Have I not reason to weep, when I have two eyes like other people, and my sisters and mother hate me for it, and push me from one corner to another, throw old clothes at me, and give me nothing to eat but the scraps they leave?Today they have given me so little that I am still quite hungry.”Then the wise woman said, “Wipe away thy tears, Two-eyes, and I will tell thee something to stop thee ever suffering from hunger again; just say to thy goat,"
"‘小羊儿，咩咩叫，小饭桌，快放好！’","“Bleat, my little goat, bleat, Cover the table with something to eat,”"
"然后你的面前就会出现一张干干净净、摆放整齐的小饭桌，桌上摆满了好吃的东西，你可以尽情地吃个够。吃饱之后，你就不再需要这个小饭桌了，这时，你只要说：","and then a clean well-spread little table will stand before thee, with the most delicious food upon it of which thou mayst eat as much as thou art inclined for, and when thou hast had enough, and hast no more need of the little table, just say,"
"‘小羊儿，咩咩叫，小饭桌，快收好。’","“Bleat, bleat, my little goat, I pray, And take the table quite away,”"
"那样它就会在你眼前消失。”说完，那个睿智的女人就离开了。两只眼心里想：“我一定要马上试一试，看她说的是不是真的，因为我实在是太饿了。”于是，她说：","and then it will vanish again from thy sight.”Hereupon the wise woman departed.But Two-eyes thought, “I must instantly make a trial, and see if what she said is true, for I am far too hungry,” and she said,"
"“小羊儿，咩咩叫，小饭桌，快放好！”","“Bleat, my little goat, bleat, Cover the table with something to eat,”"
"话音刚落，一张铺着白色台布的小饭桌便出现在她眼前了。饭桌上放好了盘子、刀叉和银勺，满桌的美味热腾腾的，就好像是刚从厨房里端出来的一样。于是，两只眼说了一句最简短的祷词：“上帝啊，愿你和我们永远在一起，阿门！”接着她便津津有味地吃了起来。吃饱之后，她就按照那个睿智的女人所教的，说道：","and scarcely had she spoken the words than a little table, covered with a white cloth, was standing there, and on it was a plate with a knife and fork, and a silver spoon; and the most delicious food was there also, warm and smoking as if it had just come out of the kitchen.Then Two-eyes said the shortest prayer she knew, “Lord God, be with us always, Amen,” and helped herself to some food, and enjoyed it.And when she was satisfied, she said, as the wise woman had taught her,"
"“小羊儿，咩咩叫，小饭桌，快收好。”","“Bleat, bleat, my little goat, I pray, And take the table quite away,”"
"转眼间，小饭桌和上面的东西就都不见了。两只眼感到非常快乐，非常幸福，她心里想：“这样的生活真是美好啊！”","and immediately the little table and everything on it was gone again.“That is a delightful way of keeping house!” thought Two-eyes, and was quite glad and happy."
"天黑了，她赶着羊回到家中，看到姐妹们在她的小陶碟里留下的一口剩饭，就连碰都没去碰一下。第二天她又出去放羊，出门时并没有把她们留给她的几口碎面包带上，面包依旧放在那里，她碰都没碰。她这样做，开始姐妹们根本没有注意到。可是她每次都这样，她们就开始察觉，说：“两只眼有些不正常，以前给她什么她都会吃个精光，可是现在一口不吃就走了。她一定有其他办法找吃的。”她们为了弄清真相，决定让一只眼跟着两只眼去牧场放羊，监视两只眼在那儿到底做了什么，看看是不是有人给她送去吃的喝的。于是，当两只眼又要出去放羊的时候，一只眼走过去对她说：“今天我陪你一起去牧场，看看你放羊放得好不好，是不是把羊带到了草多的地方。”可是两只眼看透了她的心思，便把羊赶进高高的草丛中，然后对她说：“一只眼，过来吧，咱们坐下，我唱歌给你听。”一只眼坐了下来，她不习惯走那么远路，再加上烈日炎炎，所以她感到很疲倦，并且两只眼一遍又一遍地唱着：","In the evening, when she went home with her goat, she found a small earthenware dish with some food, which her sisters had set ready for her, but she did not touch it.Next day she again went out with her goat, and left the few bits of broken bread which had been handed to her, lying untouched.The first and second time that she did this, her sisters did not remark it at all, but as it happened every time, they did observe it, and said, “There is something wrong about Two-eyes, she always leaves her food untasted, and she used to eat up everything that was given her; she must have discovered other ways of getting food.”In order that they might learn the truth, they resolved to send One-eye with Two-eyes when she went to drive her goat to the pasture, to observe what Two-eyes did when she was there, and whether any one brought her anything to eat and drink.So when Two-eyes set out the next time, One-eye went to her and said, “I will go with you to the pasture, and see that the goat is well taken care of, and driven where there is food.”But Two-eyes knew what was in One-eye’s mind, and drove the goat into high grass and said, “Come, One-eye, we will sit down, and I will sing something to you.”One-eye sat down and was tired with the unaccustomed walk and the heat of the sun, and Two-eyes sang constantly,"
"“一只眼，你还醒着吗？一只眼，你睡着了吗？”","“One eye, wakest thou?One eye, sleepest thou?”"
"直到一只眼闭上了她那一只眼，进入了梦乡，两只眼才停下来，看到她已经睡熟了，不会发现什么了，就说道：","until One-eye shut her one eye, and fell asleep, and as soon as Two-eyes saw that One-eye was fast asleep, and could discover nothing, she said,"
"“小羊儿，咩咩叫，小饭桌，快放好！”","“Bleat, my little goat, bleat, Cover the table with something to eat,”"
"然后她就坐在桌旁吃起来、喝起来，一直到她吃饱喝足了，她又大声说道：","and seated herself at her table, and ate and drank until she was satisfied, and then she again cried,"
"“小羊儿，咩咩叫，小饭桌，快收好。”","“Bleat, bleat, my little goat, I pray, And take the table quite away,”"
"转眼间，一切都立刻消失了。这时，两只眼叫醒一只眼，对她说：“一只眼，你想来放羊，可是你却睡着了，羊会趁机跑丢的。走吧，我们回家吧。”她们回到家里，两只眼还是一口饭都没吃。一只眼却没法向她妈妈解释为什么两只眼不吃饭，只得为自己开脱：“我在外面睡着了。”","and in an instant all was gone.Two-eyes now awakened One-eye, and said, “One-eye, you want to take care of the goat, and go to sleep while you are doing it, and in the meantime the goat might run all over the world.Come, let us go home again.”So they went home, and again Two-eyes let her little dish stand untouched, and One-eye could not tell her mother why she would not eat it, and to excuse herself said, “I fell asleep when I was out.”"
"第二天，妈妈对三只眼说：“这次你跟着两只眼，看她是不是在外面吃过东西了，是不是有人给她送吃的喝的，要明白，她肯定是背着我们大吃大喝了。”于是，三只眼走到两只眼面前说：“我陪你去放羊，看看你放羊放得好不好，是不是把羊带到了草多的地方。”可是，两只眼又看透了她的心思，就把羊赶到了高高的草丛中，对三只眼说：“三只眼，我们坐下来吧，我要唱歌给你听。”三只眼坐下来，走了那么远的路，再加上烈日炎炎，她已经很累了，这时两只眼又唱起上次的歌：","Next day the mother said to Three-eyes, “This time thou shalt go and observe if Two-eyes eats anything when she is out, and if any one fetches her food and drink, for she must eat and drink in secret.”So Three-eyes went to Two-eyes, and said, “I will go with you and see if the goat is taken proper care of, and driven where there is food.”But Two-eyes knew what was in Three-eyes’ mind, and drove the goat into high grass and said, “We will sit down, and I will sing something to you, Three-eyes.”Three-eyes sat down and was tired with the walk and with the heat of the sun, and Two-eyes began the same song as before, and sang,"
"“三只眼，你还醒着吗？”","“Three eyes, are you waking?”"
"可是那时，她本应该接着唱：","but then, instead of singing,"
"“三只眼，你睡着了吗？”","“Three eyes, are you sleeping?”"
"但是她不小心却唱成：","as she ought to have done, she thoughtlessly sang,"
"“两只眼，你睡着了吗？”","“Two eyes, are you sleeping?”"
"然后一直反复地唱着：","and sang all the time,"
"“三只眼，你还醒着吗？两只眼，你睡着了吗？”","“Three eyes, are you waking?Two eyes, are you sleeping?”"
"唱着，唱着，三只眼就闭上两只眼睛进入梦乡了，但是两只眼在歌中没提到的第三只眼却还醒着。的确，三只眼将第三只眼闭上了，但她却是在狡猾地装睡，她的第三只眼一眨一眨的，能够看清所发生的一切。两只眼以为三只眼真的已经睡熟了，便念起咒语：","Then two of the eyes which Three-eyes had, shut and fell asleep, but the third, as it had not been named in the song, did not sleep.It is true that Three-eyes shut it, but only in her cunning, to pretend it was asleep too, but it blinked, and could see everything very well.And when Two-eyes thought that Three-eyes was fast asleep, she used her little charm,"
"“小羊儿，咩咩叫，小饭桌，快放好！”","“Bleat, my little goat, bleat, Cover the table with something to eat,”"
"然后她就放心享用起吃的喝的，之后就叫桌子消失：","and ate and drank as much as her heart desired, and then ordered the table to go away again,"
"“小羊儿，咩咩叫，小饭桌，快收好。”","“Bleat, bleat, my little goat, I pray, And take the table quite away,”"
"三只眼什么都看见了。两只眼过去把她叫醒，说道：“三只眼，你睡着了吗？你放羊放得真好！走吧，我们回家吧。”她们回到家以后，两只眼又没吃东西。三只眼就对妈妈说：“此刻我终于明白了那傲慢的家伙为什么不吃东西了。在田野里，她对着羊儿说：","and Three-eyes had seen everything.Then Two-eyes came to her, waked her and said, “Have you been asleep, Three-eyes?You are a good care-taker!Come, we will go home.”And when they got home, Two-eyes again did not eat, and Three-eyes said to the mother, “Now, I know why that high-minded thing there does not eat.When she is out, she says to the goat,"
"‘小羊儿，咩咩叫，小饭桌，快放好！’","‘Bleat, my little goat, bleat, Cover the table with something to eat,’"
"于是她面前就出现了一张小饭桌，上面摆满了美味的食物，比我们吃的好多了。她吃饱以后，又说道：","and then a little table appears before her covered with the best of food, much better than any we have here, and when she has eaten all she wants, she says,"
"‘小羊儿，咩咩叫，小饭桌，快收好。’","‘Bleat, bleat, my little goat, I pray, And take the table quite away,’"
"然后所有东西就都消失了。我把这一切看得清清楚楚。她念咒给我听，我的两只眼睛就睡着了，可是幸好我前额的第三只眼睛还醒着。”那心怀嫉妒的妈妈听后，大声说道：“你想吃得比我们还好吗？以后你就别想啦！”于是妈妈拿起一把屠刀，一刀刺进羊的心脏，那只羊倒在地上死了。","and all disappears.I watched everything closely.She put two of my eyes to sleep by using a certain form of words, but luckily the one in my forehead kept awake.”Then the envious mother cried, “Dost thou want to fare better than we do?The desire shall pass away,” and she fetched a butcher’s knife, and thrust it into the heart of the goat, which fell down dead."
"见此情形，两只眼十分难过地离开了家，坐在田野边野草遍布的山丘上大哭了起来。突然，那个睿智的女人又站在她的身边，对她说：“两只眼，你为什么哭啊？”“叫我怎么能不哭呢？”她回答道，“我一念你教的咒语，那只小羊就把小饭桌为我摆好，如今它却被我妈妈杀掉了。现在我又要忍饥挨饿了。”睿智的女人说道：“两只眼，我告诉你一个好方法，你去求你的姐妹把这只羊的内脏分给你，然后把它埋在你家门前的地里，这样，它就又会给你带来好运了。”话音刚落，那个女人就消失了。两只眼回到家里，跟她的姐妹说道：“亲爱的姐妹，分给我一点羊身上的东西吧。我不想要什么好东西，给我点内脏就行啦！”她们笑着说：“如果那就是你想要的，你尽管拿好了。”两只眼就拿了羊内脏，天黑以后按照那个睿智的女人说的那样悄悄地把它埋在了她家门前的地里。","When Two-eyes saw that, she went out full of trouble, seated herself on the ridge of grass at the edge of the field, and wept bitter tears.Suddenly the wise woman once more stood by her side, and said, “Two-eyes, why art thou weeping?”“Have I not reason to weep?” she answered.“The goat which covered the table for me every day when I spoke your charm, has been killed by my mother, and now I shall again have to bear hunger and want.”The wise woman said, “Two-eyes, I will give thee a piece of good advice; ask thy sisters to give thee the entrails of the slaughtered goat, and bury them in the ground in front of the house, and thy fortune will be made.”Then she vanished, and Two-eyes went home and said to her sisters, “Dear sisters, do give me some part of my goat; I don’t wish for what is good, but give me the entrails.”Then they laughed and said, “If that’s all you want, you can have it.”So Two-eyes took the entrails and buried them quietly in the evening, in front of the house-door, as the wise woman had counselled her to do."
"第二天早上，当她们醒来，走出家门，看到面前挺立着一棵奇妙的树，上面长着银色的叶子和金色的果实。世界上再也没有比这更美丽、更珍贵的东西了。可她们却弄不明白，一夜之间怎么会长出这么一棵树来。只有两只眼清楚这是从羊的内脏里长出来的，因为这棵树正好长在她埋内脏的地方。此刻，妈妈对一只眼说：“孩子，爬到树上去，把果实给我们摘下来。”一只眼爬了上去，但是每当她要伸出手去摘那些金色的苹果时，树枝却总是从她的手里滑脱开来，每次都如此。就这样，不管她怎么努力，还是一个苹果也没摘到。于是妈妈说道：“三只眼，你上去吧，你有三只眼睛，你能比一只眼看得更准些。”一只眼爬下来，三只眼又爬了上去。她和一只眼一样，不论她怎么伸手去够，那些苹果总是避开她。最后，妈妈不耐烦了，便自己爬了上去，但是和一只眼三只眼一样，一抓一个空，一个苹果都没摘到。此时，两只眼说道：“让我上去试试吧，或许我能摘到苹果呢。”姐妹们大叫起来：“你，你长着两只眼睛，你能做什么呢？”但两只眼爬上了树，金色的苹果不但不从她手边溜走，反倒主动送到了她的手里。这样她就一个接一个地摘，把满满一围裙金苹果带了下来。妈妈从两只眼那里拿走了那些金苹果，但她并不因此对可怜的两只眼好些，她们只是嫉妒只有她一个人能摘到金苹果，所以对她变本加厉。","Next morning, when they all awoke, and went to the house-door, there stood a strangely magnificent tree with leaves of silver, and fruit of gold hanging among them, so that in all the wide world there was nothing more beautiful or precious.They did not know how the tree could have come there during the night, but Two-eyes saw that it had grown up out of the entrails of the goat, for it was standing on the exact spot where she had buried them.Then the mother said to One-eye, “Climb up, my child, and gather some of the fruit of the tree for us.”One-eye climbed up, but when she was about to get hold of one of the golden apples, the branch escaped from her hands, and that happened each time, so that she could not pluck a single apple, let her do what she might.Then said the mother, “Three-eyes, do you climb up; you with your three eyes can look about you better than One-eye.”One-eye slipped down, and Three-eyes climbed up.Three-eyes was not more skilful, and might search as she liked, but the golden apples always escaped her.At length the mother grew impatient, and climbed up herself, but could get hold of the fruit no better than One-eye and Three-eyes, for she always clutched empty air.Then said Two-eyes, “I will just go up, perhaps I may succeed better.”The sisters cried, “You indeed, with your two eyes, what can you do?”But Two-eyes climbed up, and the golden apples did get out of her way, but came into her hand of their own accord, so that she could pluck them one after the other, and brought a whole apronful down with her.The mother took them away from her, and instead of treating poor Two-eyes any better for this, she and One-eye and Three-eyes were only envious, because Two-eyes alone had been able to get the fruit, and they treated her still more cruelly."
"一天，正当她们都站在树下，一个年轻的骑士从远处走了过来。“两只眼，快点！”姐妹俩叫道，“蹲在这下面，不要给我们丢脸！”她们急忙用树旁的空桶盖住了两只眼，把她刚刚摘下来的金苹果也一同盖上了。当骑士走近时，她们发现他是一个英俊的贵族，他停下来欣赏这棵奇妙的金银树，对姐妹俩说：“这棵树是谁的啊？谁要是能给我折下一枝，她要什么我都会给的。”一只眼和三只眼说这树是她们的，她们愿意折一枝送给他。她们便使出浑身解数去折，但就是折不下来，因为树枝和果实老是避开她们的手。骑士看后说道：“这真是太奇怪了，树既然是你们的，可是你们连一枝树枝都折不下来！”姐妹俩还是坚持说这棵树是她们的。就在她们说话的时候，两只眼从桶下扔出几只金苹果，苹果滚到了骑士的脚边，因为姐妹俩的谎言把她惹恼了。骑士看到苹果很吃惊，就问苹果是从哪里来的。一只眼和三只眼回答说，她们还有一个姐妹，因为她和普通人一样有两只眼睛，不能出来和生人见面。然而，骑士却很想见她，就叫道：“两只眼，出来吧。”于是，两只眼放心地从桶里钻了出来，骑士见她长得十分美丽，很是惊异，就说：“两只眼，你肯定能为我从树上折下一枝树枝。”“是的。”两只眼回答道，“我肯定能做到，因为这树是我的。”于是两只眼爬到树上，轻而易举地折下了一枝长满银叶和金果的树枝，送给了骑士。骑士说：“两只眼，我怎样才能报答你呢？”“唉！”两只眼回答道，“在这儿我整天忍饥挨饿，痛苦不堪，如果你能把我带走，救我出去，我会很高兴的。”于是，骑士就把两只眼抱上马，把她带回到他父亲的城堡。在那儿，他让两只眼穿上华丽的衣服，让她尽情地享用美味。骑士非常爱她，就娶了她，他们举行了神圣的婚礼，非常幸福。两只眼被英俊的骑士带走以后，她的两个姐妹十分嫉妒她的好运。“不过这棵树还在我们这里。”她们想，“即使我们不能从树上摘下果子，可人人都会驻足观赏，来到我们这里称赞它。说不定哪天我们也会交上好运呢！”可是第二天早上，那棵树就不见了，姐妹俩的希望也落了个空。此刻两只眼从她的小房间往窗外看，让她高兴的是，那棵树就矗立在她的面前，原来它也跟着来到了这里。","It so befell that once when they were all standing together by the tree, a young knight came up.“Quick, Two-eyes,” cried the two sisters, “creep under this, and don’t disgrace us!” and with all speed they turned an empty barrel which was standing close by the tree over poor Two-eyes, and they pushed the golden apples which she had been gathering, under it too.When the knight came nearer he was a handsome lord, who stopped and admired the magnificent gold and silver tree, and said to the two sisters, “To whom does this fine tree belong?Any one who would bestow one branch of it on me might in return for it ask whatsoever he desired.”Then One-eye and Three-eyes replied that the tree belonged to them, and that they would give him a branch.They both took great trouble, but they were not able to do it, for the branches and fruit both moved away from them every time.Then said the knight, “It is very strange that the tree should belong to you, and that you should still not be able to break a piece off.”They again asserted that the tree was their property.Whilst they were saying so, Two-eyes rolled out a couple of golden apples from under the barrel to the feet of the knight, for she was vexed with One-eye and Three-eyes, for not speaking the truth.When the knight saw the apples he was astonished, and asked where they came from.One-eye and Three-eyes answered that they had another sister, who was not allowed to show herself, for she had only two eyes like any common person.The knight, however, desired to see her, and cried, “Two-eyes, come forth.”Then Two-eyes, quite comforted, came from beneath the barrel, and the knight was surprised at her great beauty, and said, “Thou, Two-eyes, canst certainly break off a branch from the tree for me.”“Yes,” replied Two-eyes, “that I certainly shall be able to do, for the tree belongs to me.”And she climbed up, and with the greatest ease broke off a branch with beautiful silver leaves and golden fruit, and gave it to the knight.Then said the knight, “Two-eyes, what shall I give thee for it?”“Alas!” answered Two-eyes, “I suffer from hunger and thirst, grief and want, from early morning till late night; if you would take me with you, and deliver me from these things, I should be happy.”So the knight lifted Two-eyes on to his horse, and took her home with him to his father’s castle, and there he gave her beautiful clothes, and meat and drink to her heart’s content, and as he loved her so much he married her, and the wedding was solemnized with great rejoicing.When Two-eyes was thus carried away by the handsome knight, her two sisters grudged her good fortune in downright earnest.The wonderful tree, however, still remains with us,” thought they, “and even if we can gather no fruit from it, still every one will stand still and look at it, and come to us and admire it.Who knows what good things may be in store for us?”But next morning, the tree had vanished, and all their hopes were at an end.And when Two-eyes looked out of the window of her own little room, to her great delight it was standing in front of it, and so it had followed her."
"两只眼幸福地度过了很长时间。一天，有两个可怜的女人走进她住的城堡，求她施舍。两只眼一看到她们的脸，才知道是她的姐姐和妹妹。她们俩现在穷困潦倒，不得不四处流浪，挨家挨户地乞讨为生。然而，两只眼不仅欢迎她们，还十分善待她们，她们俩为自己当年虐待两只眼而感到悔恨不已。","Two-eyes lived a long time in happiness.Once two poor women came to her in her castle, and begged for alms.She looked in their faces, and recognized her sisters, One-eye, and Three-eyes, who had fallen into such poverty that they had to wander about and beg their bread from door to door.Two-eyes, however, made them welcome, and was kind to them, and took care of them, so that they both with all their hearts repented the evil that they had done their sister in their youth."

"从前有个车夫，他的车载满了酒，陷在泥里走不了了，不论他怎么弄，车就是没法前进。就在那时圣母偶然经过，她看到这个可怜的车夫如此苦恼，于是对他说：“我累了，很渴，给我一杯酒吧，然后我就可以让你的车走起来。”“乐意之极，”车夫答道，“但是我没有玻璃杯，没法给你乘酒。”于是圣母摘了一朵带红色条纹的小白花，人们叫它田旋花，这种花看起来很像一个玻璃杯，圣母将其递给车夫。车夫往杯里倒满酒，然后圣母喝了，与此同时，车也活动起来了，车夫得以驾车前行。现在人们还是总把这种小花叫做“圣母的小玻璃杯”。","Once upon a time a waggoner’s cart which was heavily laden with wine had stuck so fast that in spite of all that he could do, he could not get it to move again.Then it chanced that Our Lady just happened to come by that way, and when she perceived the poor man’s distress, she said to him, “I am tired and thirsty, give me a glass of wine, and I will set thy cart free for thee.”“Willingly,” answered the waggoner, “but I have no glass in which I can give thee the wine.”Then Our Lady plucked a little white flower with red stripes, called field bindweed, which looks very like a glass, and gave it to the waggoner.He filled it with wine, and then Our Lady drank it, and in the self-same instant the cart was set free, and the waggoner could drive onwards.The little flower is still always called Our Lady’s Little Glass."
"甜粥","Sweet Porridge"
"从前有个贫穷的好女孩儿，她跟妈妈单独住在一起，她们没有食物了。所以小女孩儿到森林里去，那里住着一位老婆婆，老婆婆知道小女孩儿的悲伤，于是赠给她一个小锅，当她说“做饭，小锅，做饭”，小锅就可以熬出美味的甜粥，当她说“停下来，小锅”，小锅就停止煮食物。小女孩把锅拿回家给妈妈，现在她们就不会再因为贫穷而挨饿了，她们可以喝到可口的甜粥，而且想喝多少就喝多少。有一次小女孩外出，她的妈妈说：“做饭，小锅，做饭。”然后，小锅就煮出了美味的粥，最后她吃得很饱。当她想让小锅停下来时却不知道该对小锅说什么。所以小锅不停地煮着，粥溢出来了，但是小锅仍旧继续煮着粥，整个厨房、整个房子，到处都是粥，邻居家也是同样的情况，然后是整条街到处都流着粥，好像小锅要把整个饥饿的世界都喂饱似的，大家都非常惊慌失措，但是没人知道怎么做才能让小锅停下来。最后，只剩下一间房子没有被粥填满了，小孩回到家，只说了句：“停下来，小锅。”然后小锅就停下来了，不再煮粥。要是谁想回到这个小镇，就必须一路喝着粥回家。","THERE was a poor but good little girl who lived alone with her mother, and they no longer had anything to eat.So the child went into the forest, and there an aged woman met her who was aware of her sorrow, and presented her with a little pot, which when she said, “Cook, little pot, cook,” would cook good, sweet porridge, and when she said, “Stop, little pot,” it ceased to cook.The girl took the pot home to her mother, and now they were freed from their poverty and hunger, and ate sweet porridge as often as they chose.Once on a time when the girl had gone out, her mother said, “Cook, little pot, cook.”And it did cook and she ate till she was satisfied, and then she wanted the pot to stop cooking, but did not know the word.So it went on cooking and the porridge rose over the edge, and still it cooked on until the kitchen and whole house were full, and then the next house, and then the whole street, just as if it wanted to satisfy the hunger of the whole world, and there was the greatest distress, but no one knew how to stop it.At last when only one single house remained, the child came home and just said, “Stop, little pot,” and it stopped and gave up cooking, and whosoever wished to return to the town had to eat his way back."
"鸡驮的木头","The Beam"
"从前有一个巫师，他站在一大群人中间表演他的巫术。他带来了一个公鸡，它能驮着放在它背上的重重的木头，就好像那木头轻得像羽毛一样。但是在场的一个女孩曾经找到过四片叶子的三叶草，并变得非常智慧，以至于没有任何骗术能骗到她，而她看出来那根木头只不过是一根稻草。所以她喊道：“朋友们，你们看不到那公鸡驮的是一根稻草，而不是木头？”随即魔法就消失了，人们看到确实是稻草，就把羞愧难当、无地自容的巫师给赶走了。然而，他满带怨恨地说：“我很快会回来报仇的。”","There was once an enchanter who was standing in the midst of a great crowd of people performing his wonders.He had a cock brought in, which lifted a heavy beam and carried it as if it were as light as a feather.But a girl was present who had just found a bit of four-leaved clover, and had thus become so wise that no deception could stand out against her, and she saw that the beam was nothing but a straw.So she cried, “You people, do you not see that it is a straw that the cock is carrying, and no beam?”Immediately the enchantment vanished, and the people saw what it was, and drove the magician away in shame and disgrace.He, however, full of inward anger, said, “I will soon revenge myself?”"
"过了一段时间后，这个女孩结婚的日子到了，她妆扮一新，在送亲队伍的簇拥下到教堂去。突然她遇到了一条小溪，溪水涨得很高，上面也没有桥或是木板可以过去。这位新娘敏捷地把衣服提起，想要趟水过去。而就当她站在水中的时候，一个人，就是那个巫师，站在她身边很近的地方嘲笑起她来：“哈哈！你哪只眼睛看到那是水了？”然后她的眼睁开了，看到她自己正提着衣服站在一块开满花的暗黑色的亚麻田里。大家也都看清了整个场面，嘲笑着把她赶走了。","After some time the girl’s wedding-day came, and she was decked out, and went in a great procession over the fields to the place where the church was.All at once she came to a stream which was very much swollen, and there was no bridge and no plank to cross it.Then the bride nimbly took her clothes up, and wanted to wade through it.And just as she was thus standing in the water, a man, and it was the enchanter, cried mockingly close beside her, “Aha!Where are thine eyes that thou takest that for water?”Then her eyes were opened, and she saw that she was standing with her clothes lifted up in the middle of a field that was blue with the flowers of blue flax.Then all the people saw it likewise, and chased her away with ridicule and laughter."
"麻鸦和戴胜鸟","The Bittern and the Hoopoe"
"有人问一个放牛的老人：“你最喜欢去哪里放牛？”“这里，先生，草既不太多也不太少的地方，其他的地方都不行。”“为什么呢？”那人问。“你听见那边牧场上悲伤的叫声了么？”牧人回答道，“那是麻鸦在叫，他曾经是一个牧人，戴胜鸟曾经也是——我会告诉你整个故事。麻鸦把他的牛群赶到绿草丰茂、开满鲜花的草地上放牧，他的牛儿们变得野起来，不好管了。而戴胜鸟把他的牛赶到一个草木稀少的高山上，那里有风沙光顾，他的牛儿们开始变瘦，变得没有力气了。到了傍晚，牧人要把他们的牛群赶回家，麻鸦却不能再把他的牛儿们聚拢在一起，它们的精神太足，都跑开了。他喊道：‘回来，牛儿，回来。’但是一点用都没有，它们对他的呼唤一点都不理睬。尽管戴胜鸟的牛儿没有跑掉，但是，他甚至都不能让他的牛儿们站起来，它们是那么地虚弱无力。‘起来，起来，起来 。’他大喊大叫，但是徒劳无功，它们依然趴在沙地上。当一个人做事却不知道适度的时候，就会出现那样的情况。直到今天，尽管他们已经没有牛群需要放牧了，麻鸦还是在喊‘回来，牛儿，回来。’而戴胜鸟也在叫‘起来，起来，起来。’”","“Where do you like best to feed your flocks?” said a man to an old cow-herd.“Here, sir, where the grass is neither too rich nor too poor, or else it is no use.”“Why not?” asked the man.“Do you hear that melancholy cry from the meadow there?” answered the shepherd, “that is the bittern; he was once a shepherd, and so was the hoopoe also,—I will tell you the story.The bittern pastured his flocks on rich green meadows where flowers grew in abundance, so his cows became wild and unmanageable.The hoopoe drove his cattle on to high barren hills, where the wind plays with the sand, and his cows became thin, and got no strength.When it was evening, and the shepherds wanted to drive their cows homewards, the bittern could not get his together again; they were too high-spirited, and ran away from him.He called, “Come, cows, come,” but it was of no use; they took no notice of his calling.The hoopoe, however, could not even get his cows up on their legs, so faint and weak had they become.“Up, up, up,” screamed he, but it was in vain, they remained lying on the sand.That is the way when one has no moderation.And to this day, though they have no flocks now to watch, the bittern cries, “Come, cows, come,” and the hoopoe, “Up, up, up.”"
"迪特马申的奇事","The Ditmarsch Tale of Wonders"
"我给大家说说一些事。我曾见过两只烤鸡在天上飞，他们飞得很快，而且肚子朝天、背朝地；一个铁砧和一块磨石在莱茵河上慢条斯理地、无比优雅地漂着；一只青蛙在圣灵降临周那会儿坐在冰上，啃着犁头。我还见过三个想要逮野兔的人拄着拐杖，踩着高跷；他们其中一个耳朵听不见，一个眼睛看不见，另一个嘴巴出不了声，还有一个连路都不能走。你想知道他们是怎么抓到野兔的吗？先是眼睛看不见的人看到兔子在田里跑，接着出不了声的人叫走不了路的人去抓它，最后，走不了路的人提着兔子的脖子，抓住了它。","I will tell you something.I saw two roasted fowls flying; they flew quickly and had their breasts turned to heaven and their backs to hell, and an anvil and a mill-stone swam across the Rhine prettily, slowly, and gently, and a frog sat on the ice at Whitsuntide and ate a ploughshare.Three fellows who wanted to catch a hare, went on crutches and stilts; one of them was deaf, the second blind, the third dumb, and the fourth could not stir a step.Do you want to know how it was done?First, the blind man saw the hare running across the field, the dumb one called to the lame one, and the lame one seized it by the neck."
"我还知道，有些人想在旱地上驾船航行，于是他们在风中挂帆起航，驶过广袤的大地。后来他们驾船想要掠过高山，却在那里悲惨地淹死了。我还见过一只螃蟹正追逐着全速奔跑的野兔；高高的屋顶上有一头凭着自己的本事爬上去的母牛。在迪特马申那里，苍蝇像这儿的山羊一样大。打开窗户，或许这些谎话都能飞出去呢。","There were certain men who wished to sail on dry land, and they set their sails in the wind, and sailed away over great fields.Then they sailed over a high mountain, and there they were miserably drowned.A crab was chasing a hare which was running away at full speed, and high up on the roof lay a cow which had climbed up there.In that country the flies are as big as the goats are here.Open the window, that the lies may fly out."
"鼓手","The Drummer"
"一天傍晚，一位年轻的鼓手独自一人到郊外漫步。走到一片湖畔的时候，他看见地上放着三片白色的亚麻布。","A young drummer went out alone one evening into the country, and came to a lake on the shore of which he perceived three pieces of white linen lying."
"“好漂亮的亚麻布啊！”说着他捡起一片装进了自己的口袋。回到家，他已经忘了这事，就上床睡了。","“What fine linen,” said he, and put one piece in his pocket.He returned home, thought no more of what he had found, and went to bed."
"正要入睡时，他感觉似乎有人在喊他的名字。他侧耳倾听，听到一个柔弱的声音在喊他：“鼓手，鼓手，醒醒啊！”可此时漆黑一片，他看不见人，只感觉似乎有个人影在床边晃晃悠悠的。","Just as he was going to sleep, it seemed to him as if some one was saying his name.He listened, and was aware of a soft voice which cried to him, “Drummer, drummer, wake up!”As it was a dark night he could see no one, but it appeared to him that a figure was hovering about his bed."
"“你要干什么？”他问道。","“What do you want?” he asked."
"“还我的裙子啊，”那个声音说，“就是你昨天傍晚在湖边捡走的那条。”","“Give me back my dress,” answered the voice, “that you took away from me last evening by the lake.”"
"“我会还给你的，”鼓手说，“不过你得先告诉我你是谁。”","“You shall have it back again,” said the drummer, “if you will tell me who you are.”"
"“哦，”那个声音回答到，“我是一位强大的国王的女儿，却被一个女巫捉走了，关在了玻璃山上。我跟我的两个姐姐每天都要去湖里洗澡，可是没了裙子我就飞不回去了。她们都回去了，我只好留在这儿了。求求你，把我的裙子还给我吧。”","“Ah,” answered the voice, “I am the daughter of a mighty King; but I have fallen into the power of a witch, and am shut up on the glass-mountain.I have to bathe in the lake every day with my two sisters, but I cannot fly back again without my dress.My sisters have gone away, but I have been forced to stay behind.I entreat you to give me my dress back.”"
"“别着急，可怜的孩子。”鼓手道。","“Be easy, poor child,” said the drummer."
"“我愿意还给你。”","“I will willingly give it back to you.”"
"他从口袋里掏出裙子，摸黑递给她。她急匆匆地抓过去，想马上飞走。","He took it out of his pocket, and reached it to her in the dark.She snatched it in haste, and wanted to go away with it."
"“等一等，也许我还能帮你呢！”","“Stop a moment, perhaps I can help you.”"
"“你要帮我，只有爬上玻璃山，把我从巫婆的巫术中解救出来。可是你到不了玻璃山的。就算你到了山脚下，也爬不上去的。”","“You can only help me by ascending the glass-mountain, and freeing me from the power of the witch.But you cannot come to the glass-mountain, and indeed if you were quite close to it you could not ascend it.”"
"“只要我想做的事情，就一定做到，”鼓手说，“我很同情你，而且我无所畏惧。但是我不知道去玻璃山的路。”","“When I want to do a thing I always can do it,” said the drummer; “I am sorry for you, and have no fear of anything.But I do not know the way which leads to the glass-mountain.”"
"“要穿过住着食人巨怪的大森林，”女孩回答说，“其他的我就不敢多说什么了。”","“The road goes through the great forest, in which the man-eaters live,” she answered, “and more than that, I dare not tell you.”"
"鼓手听到一阵翅膀颤动的声音，之后女孩飞走了。","And then he heard her wings quiver, and she flew away."
"于是天刚蒙蒙亮，鼓手就起床了。他系好鼓带，毫无畏惧地走进了大森林。走了一阵子，他没发现什么巨怪，心里想：“看来我得把这些懒家伙叫醒。”于是他把鼓挂在胸前，一阵狂敲，把树上的鸟儿惊得大声鸣叫着飞散开去。没多久，躺在草丛中睡觉的一个巨怪就被惊醒了。他站起来，足有杉树那么高。","By daybreak the drummer arose, buckled on his drum, and went without fear straight into the forest.After he had walked for a while without seeing any giants, he thought to himself, “I must waken up the sluggards,” and he hung his drum before him, and beat such a reveille that the birds flew out of the trees with loud cries.It was not long before a giant who had been lying sleeping among the grass, rose up, and was as tall as a fir tree."
"“混蛋！”他大叫道，“你干嘛跑这儿来敲鼓？干嘛破坏我的美梦？”","“Wretch!” cried he; “what are you drumming here for, and wakening me out of my best sleep?”"
"鼓手回答道：“我敲鼓是因为要给后面跟着的几千人带路。”","“I am drumming,” he answered, “because I want to show the way to many thousands who are following me.”"
"“他们来我的森林做什么？”巨怪问。","“What do they want in my forest?” demanded the giant."
"“他们是来杀你的，要把你这样的怪物清理出森林！”","“They want to put an end to you, and cleanse the forest of such a monster as you are!”"
"“哈哈！”巨怪说，“那我就把你们像踩蚂蚁一样都踩死。”","“Oho!” said the giant, “I will trample you all to death like so many ants.”"
"“你以为你打得过我们吗？”鼓手说，“你弯腰去抓一个人的时候，他会逃走躲起来。但是等你躺下睡觉时，他们又从四周的树丛里钻出来，悄悄围攻你。他们腰带上可都别着铁锤子呢，可以砸破你的头骨！”","“Do you think you can do anything against us?” said the drummer; “if you stoop to take hold of one, he will jump away and hide himself; but when you are lying down and sleeping, they will come forth from every thicket, and creep up to you.Every one of them has a hammer of steel in his belt, and with that they will beat in your skull.”"
"巨怪很气恼，他暗自想：“要是和这些狡猾的人交手，肯定对我不利。我能勒死狼和熊，但和这些小蚯蚓过招，我还真无法保全自己。”","The giant grew angry and thought, “If I meddle with the crafty folk, it might turn out badly for me.I can strangle wolves and bears, but I cannot protect myself from these earthworms.”"
"“听着，小东西，”他说，“你回去吧！我发誓以后再也不骚扰你和你的同伴了。如果你还有什么要求，尽管说吧，我很愿意为你效劳。”","“Listen, little fellow,” said he; “go back again, and I will promise you that for the future I will leave you and your comrades in peace, and if there is anything else you wish for, tell me, for I am quite willing to do something to please you.”"
"“你腿长，跑起来比我快，”鼓手说，“就带我去玻璃山吧，我就发信号让其他人都撤兵，他们这次就放过你了。”","“You have long legs,” said the drummer, “and can run quicker than I; carry me to the glass-mountain, and I will give my followers a signal to go back, and they shall leave you in peace this time.”"
"“上来吧，你这只小虫子，”巨怪说，“坐我的肩上来，我带你去你想去的地方。”","“Come here, worm,” said the giant; “seat yourself on my shoulder, I will carry you where you wish to be.”"
"巨怪把他托起来，鼓手开心地敲起鼓来。巨怪心想：“那是在发信号让其他人撤退。”","The giant lifted him up, and the drummer began to beat his drum up aloft to his heart’s delight.The giant thought, “That is the signal for the other people to turn back.”"
"走了一会，来了第二个巨怪。他站在路中间，接过了鼓手，把他放在自己的扣眼里。鼓手搂住盘子大的扣子，稳稳坐着，开心地四处张望。接着又来了第三个巨怪，把鼓手从扣眼里拈出来，放在自己的帽檐上。鼓手在帽檐上溜达来溜达去，越过树顶观望着远处。他看到蔚蓝的天际浮现出一座山，心里想：“那一定就是玻璃山了。”他猜对了。距离山脚下只差两步远的时候，巨怪把鼓手放了下来。鼓手要他把自己放到山顶上，可是巨怪摇摇头，胡子间发出几声咆哮，然后他转身回森林去了。","After a while, a second giant was standing in the road, who took the drummer from the first, and stuck him in his own button-hole.The drummer laid hold of the button, which was as large as a dish, held on by it, and looked merrily around.Then they came to a third giant, who took him out of the button-hole, and set him on the rim of his hat.Then the drummer walked backwards and forwards up above, and looked over the trees, and when he perceived a mountain in the blue distance, he thought, “That must be the glass-mountain,” and so it was.The giant only made two steps more, and they reached the foot of the mountain, when the giant put him down.The drummer demanded to be put on the summit of the glass-mountain, but the giant shook his head, growled something in his beard, and went back into the forest."
"可怜的鼓手此时就站在山脚下。山高得像三座山重叠起来，而且光滑得像镜子一样，鼓手不知道该怎么爬上去。鼓手开始往上爬，可是无济于事，他一次次地滑下来。","And now the poor drummer was standing before the mountain, which was as high as if three mountains were piled on each other, and at the same time as smooth as a looking-glass, and did not know how to get up it.He began to climb, but that was useless, for he always slipped back again."
"“我要是只鸟就好了！”鼓手想，可希望终归是希望，他并没有长出翅膀来。","“If one were a bird now,” thought he; but what was the good of wishing, no wings grew for him."
"正当鼓手站在那儿不知所措的时候，他看见不远处有两个人争执得很厉害。他走过去，发现两人是为面前地上的一副马鞍而争执，他们都想得到它。","While he was standing thus, not knowing what to do, he saw, not far from him, two men who were struggling fiercely together.He went up to them and saw that they were disputing about a saddle which was lying on the ground before them, and which both of them wanted to have."
"“你们可够傻的，”鼓手说，“你们连马都没有，却为马鞍争来争去的！”","“What fools you are,” said he, “to quarrel about a saddle, when you have not a horse for it!”"
"“这马鞍很值得一争，”其中一个人回答道，“不管谁坐上去，想到哪儿就可以到哪儿。就算要到天涯海角，只要讲出自己的愿望，那也只是一瞬间的事。这副马鞍是我们俩共有的。这次该轮到我坐了，可是他不让。”","“The saddle is worth fighting about,” answered one of the men; “whoever sits on it, and wishes himself in any place, even if it should be the very end of the earth, gets there the instant he has uttered the wish.The saddle belongs to us in common.It is my turn to ride on it, but that other man will not let me do it.”"
"“我马上来给你们裁决一下。”鼓手说着往前迈了几步，在地上插了根白色的木桩子。转身回来，鼓手说：“现在你们都向木桩跑，谁先到谁就可以先坐马鞍。”","“I will soon decide the quarrel,” said the drummer, and he went to a short distance and stuck a white rod in the ground.Then he came back and said, “Now run to the goal, and whoever gets there first, shall ride first.”"
"两人撒腿就跑，可还没迈出几步远呢，鼓手就跨上马鞍，许愿登上玻璃山顶，在两个人转身之前就到达了。","Both put themselves into a trot; but hardly had they gone a couple of steps before the drummer swung himself on the saddle, wished himself on the glass-mountain, and before anyone could turn round, he was there."
"山顶上是一片平地。有座老石头屋子，屋前是一个大鱼池，屋后是一片阴森的森林。他没发现什么人或动物，四周都静悄悄的，只有风吹树叶的沙沙声，低低的白云从头顶掠过。鼓手走上前，敲了敲屋门。敲第三下的时候，门开了，出来一位老太太，她面色黝黑，眼睛通红。老太太高高的鼻梁上还架着副眼镜，用锐利的眼神打量着鼓手，问他来做什么。","On the top of the mountain was a plain.There stood an old stone house, and in front of the house lay a great fish-pond, but behind it was a dark forest.He saw neither men nor animals, everything was quiet; only the wind rustled among the trees, and the clouds moved by quite close above his head.He went to the door and knocked.When he had knocked for the third time, an old woman with a brown face and red eyes opened the door.She had spectacles on her long nose, and looked sharply at him; then she asked what he wanted."
"“我想进屋去，吃点东西，再在这里歇一晚。”鼓手说。","“Entrance, food, and a bed for the night,” answered the drummer."
"老太太回答道：“那你得答应为我做三件事，我就满足你的要求。”","“That you shall have,” said the old woman, “if you will perform three services in return.”"
"“没问题啊，”鼓手说，“我什么都能做，再难都难不倒我！”","“Why not?” he answered, “I am not afraid of any kind of work, however hard it may be.”"
"于是老太太就让他进屋了，给他吃的，还让他在一张舒适的床上睡了一夜。第二天早上，等鼓手睡醒了，老太太从她皱巴巴的手指上取下一枚顶针，交给他，吩咐道：“快去干活吧，用这枚顶针把外面鱼池里的水舀干，天黑前得干完，还有，把鱼全部捞出来，按大小种类堆放。”","The old woman let him go in, and gave him some food and a good bed at night.The next morning when he had had his sleep out, she took a thimble from her wrinkled finger, reached it to the drummer, and said, “Go to work now, and empty out the pond with this thimble; but you must have it done before night, and must have sought out all the fishes which are in the water and laid them side by side, according to their kind and size.”"
"“好奇怪的活儿！”鼓手自言自语道，但他还是拿着顶针来到鱼池，开始舀池水。他舀了一上午，可是哪怕舀一千年，单凭这枚小小的顶针怎么能够舀干这么大个鱼池里的水呢？","“That is strange work,” said the drummer, but he went to the pond, and began to empty it.He bailed the whole morning; but what can anyone do to a great lake with a thimble, even if he were to bail for a thousand years?"
"到中午时分了，鼓手心想：“根本就没用，干不干都一样。”","When it was noon, he thought, “It is all useless, and whether I work or not it will come to the same thing.”"
"于是他就坐下不干了。这时，石屋里走出一个女子，她把一小篮吃的放在他面前，问道：“你怎么了，为什么坐在这儿发愁啊？”他抬头看着她，发现她真是美如天仙。","So he gave it up and sat down.Then came a maiden out of the house who set a little basket with food before him, and said, “What ails you, that you sit so sadly here?”He looked at her, and saw that she was wondrously beautiful."
"“唉，”他叹着气说，“第一件事就完不成，后面的事该怎么办？我是来寻找住在这儿的一位公主的，可还没看见她，所以我得接着往前走。”","“Ah,” said he, “I cannot finish the first piece of work, how will it be with the others?I came forth to seek a king’s daughter who is said to dwell here, but I have not found her, and I will go farther.”"
"“待在这里吧，”女孩说，“我来帮助你。你累了，就枕在我腿上睡一觉吧。等你醒来的时候，任务就完成了。”","“Stay here,” said the maiden, “I will help you out of your difficulty.You are tired, lay your head in my lap, and sleep.When you awake again, your work will be done.”"
"鼓手听她这么说，当然求之不得了。他一闭上眼睛，女孩就转动手指上的如意戒，口中念到：“水升起，鱼出去！”","The drummer did not need to be told that twice.As soon as his eyes were shut, she turned a wishing-ring and said, “Rise, water.Fishes, come out.”"
"眨眼之间，池水像白雾一般升上天空，和其他白云一起飘走了；鱼儿自己跳上岸，按大小和种类排得整整齐齐。","Instantly the water rose on high like a white mist, and moved away with the other clouds, and the fishes sprang on the shore and laid themselves side by side each according to his size and kind."
"鼓手一觉醒来，惊讶地看见一切都做完了。不过女孩说：“还有一条鱼没有跟它的同类在一起，而是单独放着。晚上老太太回来看见她要求你做的事都做完了，会问你：‘怎么有一条鱼自个儿待着呢？’你就把这条鱼甩到她脸上，说：‘这条是留给你的，老巫婆。’”晚上巫婆来时，还真这么问了，鼓手就把鱼甩她的脸上。巫婆一副无所谓的样子，什么也没说，只是恶毒地看着他。","When the drummer awoke, he saw with amazement that all was done.But the maiden said, “One of the fish is not lying with those of its own kind, but quite alone; when the old woman comes tonight and sees that all she demanded has been done, she will ask you, ‘What is this fish lying alone for?’Then throw the fish in her face, and say, ‘This one shall be for you, old witch.’” In the evening the witch came, and when she had put this question, he threw the fish in her face.She behaved as if she did not remark it, and said nothing, but looked at him with malicious eyes."
"第二天一早，巫婆又吩咐了：“昨天的事对你来说太容易了，我必须吩咐你做一件比较难的事。今天你得去把这整个森林的树都砍倒，劈成木柴，堆成垛，傍晚前做完。”","Next morning she said, “Yesterday it was too easy for you, I must give you harder work.Today you must hew down the whole of the forest, split the wood into logs, and pile them up, and everything must be finished by the evening.”"
"她交给他一把斧头，一把大头锤和两个楔子。但是斧头是铅做的，大头锤和楔子是锡制的。等他拿到林子里一用，斧头的刃就卷边了，锤子和楔子也变形了。","She gave him an axe, a mallet, and two wedges.But the axe was made of lead, and the mallet and wedges were of tin.When he began to cut, the edge of the axe turned back, and the mallet and wedges were beaten out of shape."
"鼓手又不知道该怎么办，但是中午的时候，那个女孩又来了，给他带了午餐，还安慰他。","He did not know how to manage, but at mid-day the maiden came once more with his dinner and comforted him."
"“枕在我腿上睡一觉，”她说，“等你醒来的时候，你的任务就完成了。”","“Lay your head on my lap,” said she, “and sleep; when you awake, your work will be done.”"
"女孩转动如意戒，一刹那间整座森林都砍倒了，圆木被劈成木柴，整整齐齐地堆放着，就像是由看不见的巨人完成的。等鼓手睡醒，女孩嘱咐道：“你看，木柴都按要求堆好了，只有一根没放好。晚上老巫婆回来问起，你就用这根抽她一下，说：‘这根是留给你的，老巫婆。’”","She turned her wishing-ring, and in an instant the whole forest fell down with a crash, the wood split, and arranged itself in heaps, and it seemed just as if unseen giants were finishing the work.When he awoke, the maiden said, “Do you see that the wood is piled up and arranged, one bough alone remains; but when the old woman comes this evening and asks you about that bough, give her a blow with it, and say, ‘That is for you, you witch.’”"
"晚上老巫婆回来了，说：“看！这工作多轻松啊！但那根木柴放在那儿是留给谁的？”","The old woman came, “There!You see how easy the work was!” said she; “but for whom have you left that bough which is lying there still?”"
"“给你留的，老巫婆！”鼓手回答道，抽了老巫婆一下。但是老巫婆还是假装无所谓的样子，阴笑着说：“明天一早你把木头堆成一垛，全部烧了！”","“For you, you witch,” he answered, and gave her a blow with it.But she pretended not to feel it, laughed scornfully, and said, “Early tomorrow morning you shall arrange all the wood in one heap, set fire to it, and burn it.”"
"第二天天刚亮，鼓手就起床开始搬木头了，可是他一个人怎么能搬完整个森林的木头呢？怎么搬都无济于事。不过，那个女孩并没有在他需要的时候抛弃他。中午她给他送饭过来。他吃完饭，就枕在女孩的腿上睡着了。鼓手醒来的时候，看见山一样高的木头垛子正燃起大火，熊熊火焰向天空伸去。","He rose at break of day, and began to pick up the wood, but how can a single man get a whole forest together?The work made no progress.The maiden, however, did not desert him in his need.She brought him his food at noon, and when he had eaten, he laid his head on her lap, and went to sleep.When he awoke, the entire pile of wood was burning in one enormous flame, which stretched its tongues out into the sky."
"“听着，”女孩说，“老巫婆来的时候，还会要你做很多事；无论她吩咐什么，你都要毫无畏惧地去做，这样她也拿你没办法。不过要是你退缩了，这场大火就会烧到你身上，把你烧死。等你什么都做完了，就用双手抓住她，把她推到火里。”","“Listen to me,” said the maiden, “when the witch comes, she will give you all kinds of orders; do whatever she asks you without fear, and then she will not be able to get the better of you, but if you are afraid, the fire will lay hold of you, and consume you.At last when you have done everything, seize her with both your hands, and throw her into the midst of the fire.”"
"女孩离开了，老巫婆不知什么时候偷偷跑了过来。","The maiden departed, and the old woman came sneaking up to him."
"“噢，我好冷！”她说，“但这里有堆火，刚好暖暖我的老骨头，舒服啊！但怎么还有根木头没烧着，把它拿给我。做完这件事，你就自由了，想去哪儿去哪儿。快行行好钻进去帮我拿吧。”","“Oh, I am cold,” said she, “but that is a fire that burns; it warms my old bones for me, and does me good!But there is a log lying there which won’t burn, bring it out for me.When you have done that, you are free, and may go where you like; come, go in with a good will.”"
"鼓手毫不犹豫地跳进了火堆。但大火却没烧到他，就连一根头发都没烧着。他把那根木头拽出来，放在地上。然而，木头一放到地上就变了，变成了那位总在他遇到困境时帮助他的女子，她站在鼓手面前，身上穿着闪着金光的丝绸裙子，鼓手知道她正是公主。但老巫婆却恶毒地笑了笑，说：“你别以为你这就得到她了，想得美！”说着她向公主扑去，要把她带走，小伙子双手抓住老巫婆，把她高高举起，一下扔进火堆，火舌一下子就吞没了老巫婆，好像也迫不及待地要烧死她似的。","The drummer did not reflect long; he sprang into the midst of the flames, but they did not hurt him, and could not even singe a hair of his head.He carried the log out, and laid it down.Hardly, however, had the wood touched the earth than it was transformed, and the beautiful maiden who had helped him in his need stood before him, and by the silken and shining golden garments which she wore, he knew right well that she was the king’s daughter.But the old woman laughed venomously, and said, “You think you have her safe, but you have not got her yet!”Just as she was about to fall on the maiden and take her away, the youth seized the old woman with both his hands, raised her up on high, and threw her into the jaws of the fire, which closed over her as if it were delighted that the old witch was to be burnt."
"这时，公主才仔细打量着鼓手，发现他是个英俊的小伙子，又念及他不顾生命危险解救她，于是她把手放到他的掌心，说：“你为我甘冒一切危险，但我也愿意为你付出一切。请承诺对我忠贞不渝吧，那么你就是我的丈夫了。我们以后会非常富有，老巫婆搜刮的财宝已经够我俩用的了。”","Then the king’s daughter looked at the drummer, and when she saw that he was a handsome youth and remembered how he had risked his life to deliver her, she gave him her hand, and said, “You have ventured everything for my sake, but I also will do everything for your.Promise to be true to me, and you shall be my husband.We shall not want for riches, we shall have enough with what the witch has gathered together here.”"
"公主把鼓手带进石屋，那里到处都是老巫婆敛来的钱柜宝箱。公主没有拿那些金银，只带了些宝石。公主不想继续留在玻璃山上了，于是鼓手对她说：“靠着我坐到马鞍上来，我们就可以像小鸟一样飞下山了。”","She led him into the house, where there were chests and coffers crammed with the old woman’s treasures.The maiden left the gold and silver where it was, and took only the precious stones.She would not stay any longer on the glass-mountain, so the drummer said to her, “Seat yourself by me on my saddle, and then we will fly down like birds.”"
"“我不想坐这个破旧的马鞍，”公主说，“我只需转动一下如意戒，我们就回家了。”","“I do not like the old saddle,” said she, “I need only turn my wishing-ring and we shall be at home.”"
"“好啊！”鼓手答道，“那我们先到城门口吧。”","“Very well, then,” answered the drummer, “then wish us in front of the town-gate.”"
"一转眼，他们就到了城门口。但这时鼓手对公主说：“我想去见见父母，告诉他们这个消息，就在这儿等着我吧，我很快就回来。”","In the twinkling of an eye they were there, but the drummer said, “I will just go to my parents and tell them the news, wait for me outside here, I shall soon be back.”"
"“哎，”公主说，“求你要小心啊。到家后别吻你父母的右脸颊，要不然你就会忘记一切，把我孤零零一个人扔在这儿的。”","“Ah,” said the king’s daughter, “I beg you to be careful.On your arrival do not kiss your parents on the right cheek, or else you will forget everything, and I shall stay behind here outside, alone and deserted.”"
"“我怎么会忘记你呢?”鼓手承诺见完父母马上就回来，并举手起誓。","“How can I forget you?” said he, and promised her to come back very soon, and gave his hand on it."
"可等鼓手回到家里，由于他变化太大了，谁都不认识他了，因为他在玻璃山上过的三天相当于凡间的三年。终于认出他后，他的父母高兴地搂着儿子的脖子，他也特别感动，忘记了公主的嘱咐，亲了父母的左右脸颊。但当他一吻到父母的右脸颊，就再也记不得公主这个人了。鼓手把口袋都掏空了，把大颗大颗的宝石堆在桌上。他的父母看着这么多财宝，简直手足无措了。后来，他父亲用这笔钱建了一座华丽无比的城堡，四周都是花园、树林和草坪，简直像给王子建的。庭院建好后，母亲对他说：“我已经帮你选好了一位女孩做妻子，三天之后就举行婚礼吧。”","When he went into his father’s house, he had changed so much that no one knew who he was, for the three days which he had passed on the glass-mountain had been three years.Then he made himself known, and his parents fell on his neck with joy, and his heart was so moved that he forgot what the maiden had said, and kissed them on both cheeks.But when he had given them the kiss on the right cheek, every thought of the king’s daughter vanished from him.He emptied out his pockets, and laid handfuls of the largest jewels on the table.The parents had not the least idea what to do with the riches.Then the father built a magnificent castle all surrounded by gardens, woods, and meadows as if a Prince were going to live in it, and when it was ready, the mother said, “I have found a maiden for you, and the wedding shall be in three days.”"
"儿子同意了父母的安排。","The son was content to do as his parents desired."
"在城门外，可怜的公主还在久久地等候小伙子回来。一直等到天黑了，她想：“他一定是亲了父母的右脸颊，忘记我了。”","The poor King’s daughter had stood for a long time without the town waiting for the return of the young man.When evening came, she said, “He must certainly have kissed his parents on the right cheek, and has forgotten me.”"
"公主心里十分悲伤，她许愿让自己隐居到一座寂寞的森林小屋里，不愿再回父亲的宫殿了。不过，每天傍晚，她都会去城里，特意走过鼓手的家门。鼓手经常看见这个女子，却再也不记得她了。终于有一天，公主听到人们说：“鼓手明天就要成婚了。”","Her heart was full of sorrow, she wished herself into a solitary little hut in a forest, and would not return to her father’s court.Every evening she went into the town and passed the young man’s house; he often saw her, but he no longer knew her.At length she heard the people saying, “The wedding will take place tomorrow.”"
"公主对自己说：“我要再努力一次，挽回鼓手的心。”","Then she said, “I will try if I can win his heart back.”"
"在鼓手婚礼的第一天，公主转动如意戒，念道：“请许我一条如阳光般绚烂的裙子吧！”","On the first day of the wedding ceremonies, she turned her wishing-ring, and said, “A dress as bright as the sun.”"
"转眼间，一条裙子出现在她面前，绚烂无比，仿佛真是用阳光织就的。 当所有的宾客都到齐了，她才进入大厅。每个人看见这条炫丽的裙子，都无比惊叹。尤其是新娘子，因为美丽的衣裙是她的最爱，于是她走到公主面前，问她是否可以卖给她。","Instantly the dress lay before her, and it was as bright as if it had been woven of real sunbeams.When all the guests were assembled, she entered the hall.Every one was amazed at the beautiful dress, and the bride most of all, and as pretty dresses were the things she had most delight in, she went to the stranger and asked if she would sell it to her."
"“钱可买不到我这条裙子，”公主答道，“不过如果你在新婚头一夜，能让我守在新郎卧室外的话，我就把裙子白送给你。”","“Not for money,” she answered, “but if I may pass the first night outside the door of the room where your betrothed sleeps, I will give it up to you.”"
"新娘禁不住诱惑，就同意了，不过她在新郎晚上喝的酒里放了安眠药，新郎喝下去就陷入沉睡了。夜深人静的时候，公主悄悄来到鼓手的卧室外，将门推开一道缝，朝里面喊道：","The bride could not overcome her desire and consented, but she mixed a sleeping-draught with the wine her betrothed took at night, which made him fall into a deep sleep.When all had become quiet, the king’s daughter crouched down by the door of the bedroom, opened it just a little, and cried,"
"“鼓手啊，鼓手，你可听见？","“Drummer, drummer, I pray you hear!"
"难道已经忘记我们相亲又相爱？","Have you forgotten you held me dear?"
"玻璃山上的日日夜夜我们相依又相伴，","That on the glass-mountain we sat hour by hour?"
"我也曾救你于巫婆的万般魔法，","That I rescued your life from the witch’s power?"
"难道你忘了你曾对我许下的衷心誓言？","Did you not plight your troth to me?"
"鼓手啊，鼓手，请倾听我的真心呼唤！”","Drummer, drummer, harken to me!”"
"可一切都是白费。鼓手没有醒，第二天黎明，公主不得不失望地离开。","But it was all in vain, the drummer did not awake, and when morning dawned, the king’s daughter was forced to go back again as she came."
"第二天傍晚，公主又转动如意戒，念道：“请许我一条如月光般银光闪闪的裙子吧！”","On the second evening she turned her wishing-ring and said, “A dress as silvery as the moon.”"
"当她身着这如月光般柔美的裙子出现在宴席上时，新娘又忍不住诱惑了。公主又把裙子送给她，这样公主又可以在新郎卧室外守一晚。","When she appeared at the feast in the dress which was as soft as moonbeams, it again excited the desire of the bride, and the king’s daughter gave it to her for permission to pass the second night also, outside the door of the bedroom."
"夜深人静的时候，她又在门外喊道：","Then in the stillness of the night, she cried,"
"“鼓手啊，鼓手，你可听见？","“Drummer, drummer, I pray you hear!"
"难道已经忘记我们相亲又相爱？","Have you forgotten you held me dear?"
"玻璃山上的日日夜夜我们相依又相伴，","That on the glass-mountain we sat hour by hour?"
"我也曾救你于巫婆的万般魔法，","That I rescued your life from the witch’s power?"
"难道你就忘了你曾对我许下的衷心誓言？","Did you not plight your troth to me?"
"鼓手啊， 鼓手，请倾听我的真心呼唤！”","Drummer, drummer, harken to me!”"
"但是鼓手还是被安眠药麻醉得沉沉睡去，未能被唤醒。天一亮，她只能悲伤地回到林中的小木屋里。但是，幸好新郎的家人都听到了这位陌生女子在夜晚的悲叹，他们把那些话告诉了新郎。他们还提醒他，他之所以听不见，是因为新娘在酒里放了安眠药。","But the drummer, who was stupefied with the sleeping-draught, could not be aroused.Sadly next morning she went back to her hut in the forest.But the people in the house had heard the lamentation of the stranger-maiden, and told the bridegroom about it.They told him also that it was impossible that he could hear anything of it, because the maiden he was going to marry had poured a sleeping-draught into his wine."
"第三个黄昏，公主又转动如意戒，念道：“请许我一条如星光般闪耀的裙子吧。”","On the third evening, the king’s daughter turned her wishing-ring, and said, “A dress glittering like the stars.”"
"当公主身着这条裙子出现在宴席上，新娘被这条惊艳无比的裙子深深迷住了，她对公主说：“我一定要，而且一定会拥有它！”","When she showed herself therein at the feast, the bride was quite beside herself with the splendor of the dress, which far surpassed the others, and she said, “I must, and will have it.”"
"于是，公主又如愿以偿地换来了第三个可以守在新郎卧室外的夜晚。然而，这一夜，新郎没有喝下新娘放过药的酒，而是悄悄把酒倒在了床后，夜深人静之时，他终于听见了一个女子用甜美的声音对他呼唤：","The maiden gave it as she had given the others for permission to spend the night outside the bridegroom’s door.The bridegroom, however, did not drink the wine which was handed to him before he went to bed, but poured it behind the bed, and when everything was quiet, he heard a sweet voice which called to him,"
"“鼓手啊，鼓手，你可听见？","“Drummer, drummer, I pray you hear!"
"难道你已忘记我们相亲又相爱？","Have you forgotten you held me dear?"
"在玻璃山上的日日夜夜我们相依又相伴，","That on the glass-mountain we sat hour by hour?"
"我也曾救你于巫婆的万般魔法，","That I rescued your life from the witch’s power?"
"难道你就忘了你对我许下的衷心誓言？","Did you not plight your troth to me?"
"鼓手啊，鼓手，请倾听我的真心呼唤！”","Drummer, drummer, harken to me!”"
"一刹那间，鼓手什么都想起来了！","Suddenly, his memory returned to him."
"“天哪！”他大叫道，“我怎么能做出如此不忠的事情啊？但都怪我当时太激动，吻了父母的右脸颊，我才变得如此糊涂啊！”鼓手一跃而起，握住公主的手，把她带到父母面前。","“Ah,” cried he, “how can I have acted so unfaithfully; but the kiss which in the joy of my heart I gave my parents, on the right cheek, that is to blame for it all, that is what stupefied me!”He sprang up, took the king’s daughter by the hand, and led her to his parents’ bed."
"“这才是我的新娘，”他说道，“如果我娶了别人，我就大错特错了！”他的父母听他讲了事情的前因后果之后，也赞成了儿子的做法。大厅里再次灯火通明，鼓号手也请来了，亲戚朋友们再次应邀前来，在一片欢乐隆重的气氛中，举行了真正的婚礼。而第一位新娘因为得到了三条漂亮的裙子作为补偿，也表示自己很满意。","“This is my true bride,” said he; “if I marry the other, I shall do a great wrong.The parents, when they heard how everything had happened, gave their consent.Then the lights in the hall were lighted again, drums and trumpets were brought, friends and relations were invited to come, and the real wedding was solemnized with great rejoicing.The first bride received the beautiful dresses as a compensation, and declared herself satisfied."
"麦穗","The Ear of Corn"
"很久很久以前，上帝还会亲自到人间走走，那时候土地的收成比现在要好得多，一根麦穗上可不是只结五六十粒麦粒，而是有四五百倍那么多。那时的麦穗从麦秆底部一直长到顶端，麦秆有多高，麦穗就长多高。但是人们生来就是如此，生活富裕了就不再珍惜上帝的恩赐，而是变得满不在乎并且马虎草率起来。一天，一个妇女带着她的孩子走过一片麦田，孩子在她身边跑来跑去，掉进了水坑，把她的连衣裙都弄脏了。这位母亲马上扯下一把漂亮的麦穗来擦她的裙子。","In former times, when God himself still walked the earth, the fruitfulness of the soil was much greater than it is now; then the ears of corn did not bear fifty or sixty, but four or five hundred-fold.Then the corn grew from the bottom to the very top of the stalk, and according to the length of the stalk was the length of the ear.Men however are so made, that when they are too well off they no longer value the blessings which come from God, but grow indifferent and careless.One day a woman was passing by a corn-field when her little child, who was running beside her, fell into a puddle, and dirtied her frock.On this the mother tore up a handful of the beautiful ears of corn, and cleaned the frock with them."
"这时候，上帝恰好路过，看到了这一切，他非常生气，说道：“从今以后麦秆上再也不会长穗了，人类再也不配得到神的恩赐。”旁观的人听到这些话后都吓坏了，连忙跪下来祈求上帝说，即使他们自己不配享有这份恩赐，但为了那些无辜的小鸟，也请上帝把麦穗留在麦秆上，否则小鸟们会饿死的。上帝预知到小鸟的苦难，觉得它们很可怜，便答应了人们的请求。因此，麦穗就变成现在这样了。","When the Lord, who just then came by, saw that, he was angry, and said, “Henceforth shall the stalks of corn bear no more ears; men are no longer worthy of heavenly gifts.”The by-standers who heard this, were terrified, and fell on their knees and prayed that he would still leave something on the stalks, even if the people were undeserving of it, for the sake of the innocent birds which would otherwise have to starve.The Lord, who foresaw their suffering, had pity on them, and granted the request.So the ears were left as they now grow."
"本领非凡的四兄弟","The Four Skilful Brothers"
"从前，有个穷人，养育了四个儿子。儿子长大成人后，他对他们说：“亲爱的儿子们，你们得去外面闯闯事业了。我很穷，给不了你们什么。所以你们就出发吧，到外面去学点本领吧，瞧瞧你们各自能有多大的出息。”于是，四兄弟就各自拿上手杖，与父亲道别，然后一起出了城门。同行了一段路，他们走到一个岔路口，岔路口延伸向四个不同的方向。老大说：“咱们就在这儿道别吧！四年后的今天，我们就在这儿见面，现在我们就各自去闯荡吧。”","There was once a poor man who had four sons, and when they were grown up, he said to them, “My dear children, you must now go out into the world, for I have nothing to give you, so set out, and go to some distance and learn a trade, and see how you can make your way.”So the four brothers took their sticks, bade their father farewell, and went through the town-gate together.When they had travelled about for some time, they came to a cross-way which branched off in four different directions.Then said the eldest, “Here we must separate, but on this day four years, we will meet each other again at this spot, and in the meantime we will seek our fortunes.”"
"于是四兄弟就各奔前程。老大在路上遇到一个人，那个人问他去向何方，要干什么。“我想学个本事。”老大回答道。那个人便说：“随我来吧，去当小偷。”“不行，”老大说，“那才不是正道呢，最终小偷都要被绞死的。”“呵呵，”那个人说，“别担心什么绞刑，我教你偷的东西别人根本拿不到手，而且永远不会有人逮到你。”老大被说动了心，跟着那个人学习技术，最后成了一名技术精湛的小偷，身手灵活到只有他想不到的，没有偷不到的。老二也遇到一个人同样问他要学什么。“我还不知道呢。”他回答道。“跟我走吧，去学天文学，那可是再好不过的本领，学了就无所不知了。”老二欣然同意，最终成为了一名优秀的天文学家，学成准备离开的时候，师傅送给他一副望远镜，嘱咐道：“它可以帮你看到天上地上所有的事情，什么都逃不过你的眼睛。”老三拜了一位猎人为师，猎人对他悉心指导，把自己的打猎本领全部传授给了他，老三最终成了一名经验丰富的猎人。老三学成离开的时候，师傅送他一只猎枪，嘱咐说：“这是只神枪！你想打什么都打得中。”老四也在路上遇到一个人问他要去做什么。“想不想做个裁缝？”那人问。“不喜欢，”老四回答道，“一天到晚得弯腰驼背地坐着，没完没了地缝缝补补，我可不喜欢做裁缝。”“噢，那你就说错啦。”那人说，“我会教你一种非常特别的缝纫技术，那可是一门令人敬重的体面技艺，这种技艺可以说是倍受景仰。”于是老四就答应了，跟那人从头开始学习这门非常特别的裁缝技术。学成离开的时候，师傅送他一根针，嘱咐道：“这根针可以缝合任何东西。不管是蛋壳那样易碎的，还是钢那样坚硬的东西，它都能缝得完完整整、天衣无缝。”","Then each of them went his way, and the eldest met a man who asked him where he was going, and what he was intending to do?“I want to learn a trade,” he replied.Then the other said, “Come with me, and be a thief.”“No,” he answered, “that is no longer regarded as a reputable trade, and the end of it is that one has to swing on the gallows.”“Oh,” said the man, “you need not be afraid of the gallows; I will only teach you to get such things as no other man could ever lay hold of, and no one will ever detect you.”So he allowed himself to be talked into it, and while with the man became an accomplished thief, and so dexterous that nothing was safe from him, if he once desired to have it.The second brother met a man who put the same question to him what he wanted to learn in the world.“I don’t know yet,” he replied.“Then come with me, and be an astronomer; there is nothing better than that, for nothing is hid from you.”He liked the idea, and became such a skillful astronomer that when he had learnt everything, and was about to travel onwards, his master gave him a telescope and said to him, “With that you canst thou see whatsoever takes place either on earth or in heaven, and nothing can remain concealed from thee.”A huntsman took the third brother into training, and gave him such excellent instruction in everything which related to huntsmanship, that he became an experienced hunter.When he went away, his master gave him a gun and said, “It will never fail you; whatsoever you aim at, you are certain to hit.”The youngest brother also met a man who spoke to him, and inquired what his intentions were.“Would you not like to be a tailor?” said he.“Not that I know of,” said the youth; “sitting doubled up from morning till night, driving the needle and the goose backwards and forwards, is not to my taste.”“Oh, but you are speaking in ignorance,” answered the man; “with me you would learn a very different kind of tailoring, which is respectable and proper, and for the most part very honorable.”So he let himself be persuaded, and went with the man, and learnt his art from the very beginning.When they parted, the man gave the youth a needle, and said, “With this you can sew together whatever is given you, whether it is as soft as an egg or as hard as steel; and it will all become one piece of stuff, so that no seam will be visible.”"
"转眼到了四年后约定见面的那一天，四兄弟同时赶到了那个岔路口，他们彼此亲吻拥抱，一起回家看望父亲。父亲开心地说：“啊，现在你们终于回家啦。”他们把这四年的经历一一告诉了父亲，个个都学成出师了。此刻大家围坐在房前的一棵大树下，父亲对儿子们说：“我来考考你们，看你们本事如何！”他抬头看看大树，对老二说：“在树顶的两段树枝间，有个苍头燕雀的窝，告诉我里面有多少鸟蛋。”天文学家拿起望远镜，看了看，说：“有五只蛋。”父亲转头又对大儿子说：“你去把蛋取下来，别惊动了那只孵蛋的鸟。”神偷爬上树，把五只蛋从那只鸟身下取了出来，它根本没有察觉，还安静地坐着孵蛋呢。神偷把蛋拿给父亲。父亲把其中四只蛋分别放在桌子的一角，另一只蛋置于桌子中心，对当猎人的三儿子说：“现在，你只射一枪，要让子弹从五只蛋中心穿过。”猎人瞄准，开枪射击，正如父亲要求的那样，一枪就射中了五个蛋。他一定是拥有一些用于回旋射击的子弹。“现在轮到你了，”父亲对老四说，“你把蛋重新缝起来，里面的雏鸟也得缝好，要让它完好无损，就像没射穿过一样。”裁缝拿出他的神针，照父亲的吩咐缝起来。完成之后，大儿子爬上树，又把蛋放回了鸟窝，放到那只鸟身下，它依然没有察觉。雌鸟整天孵蛋，几天后，五只雏鸟钻出蛋壳，在每只鸟的脖子上，裁缝曾经缝合的地方还留有条红线。","When the appointed four years were over, the four brothers arrived at the same time at the cross-roads, embraced and kissed each other, and returned home to their father.“So now,” said he, quite delighted, “the wind has blown you back again to me.”They told him of all that had happened to them, and that each had learnt his own trade.Now they were sitting just in front of the house under a large tree, and the father said, “I will put you all to the test, and see what you can do.”Then he looked up and said to his second son, “Between two branches up at the top of this tree, there is a chaffinch’s nest, tell me how many eggs there are in it.”The astronomer took his glass, looked up, and said, “There are five.”Then the father said to the eldest, “Fetch the eggs down without disturbing the bird which is sitting hatching them.”The skillful thief climbed up, and took the five eggs from beneath the bird, which never observed what he was doing, and remained quietly sitting where she was, and brought them down to his father.The father took them, and put one of them on each corner of the table, and the fifth in the middle, and said to the huntsman, “With one shot thou shalt shoot me the five eggs in two, through the middle.”The huntsman aimed, and shot the eggs, all five as the father had desired, and that at one shot.He certainly must have had some of the powder for shooting round corners.“Now it’s your turn,” said the father to the fourth son; “you shall sew the eggs together again, and the young birds that are inside them as well, and you must do it so that they are not hurt by the shot.”The tailor brought his needle, and sewed them as his father wished.When he had done this the thief had to climb up the tree again, and carry them to the nest, and put them back again under the bird without her being aware of it.The bird sat her full time, and after a few days the young ones crept out, and they had a red line round their necks where they had been sewn together by the tailor."
"“棒极了，”老人对儿子们说，“个个都成了神手啊！你们这几年的时间没有白费，学到了非凡的好本领。我说不出你们之中谁最值得表扬。如果早点有机会让你们一展身手，这就可以证明了。”不久，国家出了件大事，国王的女儿被一头龙给叼走了。国王日夜焦虑，通告全国：救回公主的人，就可以娶公主为妻。四兄弟商量道：“这可是咱们一展身手的好机会啊！”他们相约一同上路去拯救公主。“我很快就可以知道她哪里！”天文学家拿出望远镜，看了看，说，“看见了，她在海中间的一块大石上，那条恶龙就在一边守着呢。”之后，天文学家去面见国王，并向国王要了一艘船。四兄弟驾着船，穿越大海，最后到了那块岩石边。公主就坐在那儿呢，恶龙躺在她腿上正睡着。猎人说：“我不敢开枪，怕误伤了美丽的公主。”“那么让我来试试。”神偷应声道。他爬上大石，把公主从恶龙身下偷出来，他的动作是那么轻快敏捷，恶龙一点都没意识到，还在呼呼大睡呢！他们很兴奋，把公主抱上船，然后驾船驶入大海。但是，那条恶龙醒来后，不见公主，就气呼呼地追赶他们的船。正当恶龙在船上空盘旋，准备俯冲下来的时候，猎人掏出神枪，一枪打中了它的心脏。恶龙当场毙命，掉了下来，但是巨大的身躯把船砸碎了。然而，幸运的是，他们抓住了一些木板，在大海上漂浮着。于是大家又陷入危险处境，可是裁缝可没闲着，他掏出神针，几针就把那几块木板给缝好了，然后他们坐在木板上，继续寻找散落海中的船体碎片。接着，裁缝把碎片一块块缝合起来，很快船就可以正常行驶了，他们安全地回到了王国。","“Well,” said the old man to his sons, “I begin to think you are worth more than breen clover; you have used your time well, and learnt something good.I can’t say which of you deserves the most praise.That will be proved if you have but an early opportunity of using your talents.”Not long after this, there was a great uproar in the country, for the King’s daughter was carried off by a dragon.The King was full of trouble about it, both by day and night, and caused it to be proclaimed that whosoever brought her back should have her to wife.The four brothers said to each other, “This would be a fine opportunity for us to show what we can do!” and resolved to go forth together and liberate the King’s daughter.“I will soon know where she is,” said the astronomer, and looked through his telescope and said, “I see her already, she is far away from here on a rock in the sea, and the dragon is beside her watching her.”Then he went to the King, and asked for a ship for himself and his brothers, and sailed with them over the sea until they came to the rock.There the King’s daughter was sitting, and the dragon was lying asleep on her lap.The huntsman said, “I dare not fire, I should kill the beautiful maiden at the same time.”“Then I will try my art,” said the thief, and he crept thither and stole her away from under the dragon, so quietly and dexterously, that the monster never remarked it, but went on snoring.Full of joy, they hurried off with her on board ship, and steered out into the open sea; but the dragon, who when he awoke had found no princess there, followed them, and came snorting angrily through the air.Just as he was circling above the ship, and about to descend on it, the huntsman shouldered his gun, and shot him to the heart.The monster fell down dead, but was so large and powerful that his fall shattered the whole ship.Fortunately, however, they laid hold of a couple of planks, and swam about the wide sea.Then again they were in great peril, but the tailor, who was not idle, took his wondrous needle, and with a few stitches sewed the planks together, and they seated themselves upon them, and collected together all the fragments of the vessel.Then he sewed these so skilfully together, that in a very short time the ship was once more seaworthy, and they could go home again in safety."
"国王和女儿重逢，十分高兴。他对四兄弟说：“你们之中有一位可以娶到公主，但究竟是谁，这要你们自己决定了。”四兄弟各执一词，激烈地争论起来。天文学家说：“如果不是我先发现公主的位置，你们那些本领也用不上。所以，公主应该属于我。”神偷说：“光发现公主有什么用？还不是我把公主从恶龙身下偷出来的？她应该属于我！”猎人也说：“要不是我一枪打死了恶龙，你们所有的人，包括公主，不早就被恶龙撕成碎片了吗？公主应该属于我！”裁缝说：“要不是我用我的技术把船缝好，你们早就悲惨地葬身海底了，公主应该属于我才对！”最后国王发话了：“你们的功劳一样大，可是你们四个人不能都娶到公主，所以，她谁也不能嫁，但是作为报答，我决定把王国的一半送给你们，作为奖赏。”听到这个决定，四兄弟都很开心，说：“这样好！免得我们兄弟相争，伤了和气。”后来他们得到了半个王国，和父亲一起过着幸福的生活，直到升上天堂。","When the King once more saw his daughter, there were great rejoicings.He said to the four brothers, “One of you shall have her to wife, but which of you it is to be you must settle among yourselves.”Then a warm contest arose among them, for each of them preferred his own claim.The astronomer said, “If I had not seen the princess, all your arts would have been useless, so she is mine.”The thief said, “What would have been the use of your seeing, if I had not got her away from the dragon?so she is mine.”The huntsman said, “You and the princess, and all of you, would have been torn to pieces by the dragon if my ball had not hit him, so she is mine.”The tailor said, “And if I, by my art, had not sewn the ship together again, you would all of you have been miserably drowned, so she is mine.”Then the King uttered this saying, “Each of you has an equal right, and as all of you cannot have the maiden, none of you shall have her, but I will give to each of you, as a reward, half a kingdom.”The brothers were pleased with this decision, and said, “It is better thus than that we should be at variance with each other.”Then each of them received half a kingdom, and they lived with their father in the greatest happiness as long as it pleased God."
"狐狸与猫","The Fox and the Cat"
"猫在森林里碰巧遇见了狐狸，它想：“狐狸既聪明又世故，倍受世人尊敬呢。”于是，猫友善地对狐狸说：“您好，亲爱的狐狸先生，您近来可好？您日子过得如何？您准备怎么熬过荒年呢？”心高气傲的狐狸将猫从头到脚打量了一番，犹豫了很长时间，不知是否要回答。最后，狐狸说：“哼，你这个只会捋胡须的倒霉鬼，看你花里花气的蠢样，像个饿死鬼似的成天追着耗子跑，你想干什么？竟然还敢问我过得如何？你学过什么？会几样本领？”猫谦虚地答道：“我只会一样。”“是什么？”狐狸问。“猎狗追我的时候，我可以跳到树上去保命。”“就这个？”狐狸回答。“我会的本领可有上百样，此外，我还有满满一袋子的计谋。你这可怜虫，跟我来吧，让我教教你怎么甩掉猎狗。”就在这时，猎人带着四只狗走了过来。猫敏捷地跳上了树，坐在了树梢上，藏在茂密的枝叶当中。“快打开您的智慧之袋，狐狸先生，快啊。”猫对着狐狸大喊。可猎犬已经追到了狐狸，并死死地逮住了它。“唉，狐狸先生，”猫叹道，“您纵是有百般本领还是难逃厄运啊！您要是能像我这样窜到树上去，也不会就此丧命啊。”","It happened that the cat met the fox in a forest, and as she thought to herself,  “He is clever and full of experience, and much esteemed in the world,” she spoke to him in a friendly way.“Good-day, dear Mr. Fox, how are you? How is all with you?How are you getting through this dear season?”The fox, full of all kinds of arrogance, looked at the cat from head to foot, and for a long time did not know whether he would give any answer or not.At last he said, “Oh, thou wretched beard-cleaner, thou piebald fool, thou hungry mouse-hunter, what canst thou be thinking of?Dost thou venture to ask how I am getting on?What hast thou learnt?How many arts dost thou understand?” “I understand but one,” replied the cat, modestly.“What art is that?” asked the fox.“When the hounds are following me, I can spring into a tree and save myself.”“Is that all?” said the fox.“I am master of a hundred arts, and have into the bargain a sackful of cunning.Thou makest me sorry for thee; come with me, I will teach thee how people get away from the hounds.”Just then came a hunter with four dogs.The cat sprang nimbly up a tree, and sat down on top of it, where the branches and foliage quite concealed her.“Open your sack, Mr. Fox, open your sack,” cried the cat to him, but the dogs had already seized him, and were holding him fast.“Ah, Mr. Fox,” cried the cat.“You with your hundred arts are left in the lurch!Had you been able to climb like me, you would not have lost your life.”"
"懒惰的纺纱妇","The Lazy Spinner"
"从前，在一个村庄里住着一个男人和他的妻子。妻子懒得什么都不想做；无论她的丈夫给她什么纺，她都纺不完，而且她纺了的线也不缠起来，让它全都纠缠成一堆。如果她的丈夫责骂她，她总能找到借口，说：“啊，我都没有卷轴，怎么把线缠起来？你赶快去森林里给我弄一个来呀。”“如果只是这个原因，”男人说，“那么我这就去森林里，弄些木材来做个卷轴。”于是，这个女人害怕如果他有了木材就会给她做个卷轴，那么她就不得不把线缠起来，然后又要开始纺新线。她稍微一动脑筋，就想到了一个好主意，她秘密地跟着她的丈夫去了森林，当他爬上一棵树边选边砍时，她就溜到下面丈夫看不到的灌木丛里，喊道：","In a certain village there once lived a man and his wife, and the wife was so idle that she would never work at anything; whatever her husband gave her to spin, she did not get done, and what she did spin she did not wind, but let it all remain entangled in a heap.If the man scolded her, she was always ready with her tongue, and said, “Well, how should I wind it, when I have no reel?Just you go into the forest and get me one.”“If that is all,” said the man, “then I will go into the forest, and get some wood for making reels.”Then the woman was afraid that if he had the wood he would make her a reel of it, and she would have to wind her yarn off, and then begin to spin again.She bethought herself a little, and then a lucky idea occurred to her, and she secretly followed the man into the forest, and when he had climbed into a tree to choose and cut the wood, she crept into the thicket below where he could not see her, and cried,"
"“砍木材做卷轴的人会死，缠线的人也会亡。”","“He who cuts wood for reels shall die, And he who winds, shall perish.”"
"丈夫听到后，把斧头放下停了一会儿，开始考虑那是什么意思。“喂，”最后他说，“怎么会那样呢；一定是我耳鸣，我可不能无中生有，自己吓自己。”于是，他再次抓起斧头，开始砍，然后下面又传来叫喊声：","The man listened, laid down his axe for a moment, and began to consider what that could mean.“Hollo,” he said at last, “what can that have been; my ears must have been singing, I won’t alarm myself for nothing.”So he again seized the axe, and began to hew, then again there came a cry from below:"
"“砍木材做卷轴的人会死，缠线的人也会亡。”","“He who cuts wood for reels shall die, And he who winds, shall perish.”"
"他停下来，觉得既害怕又担忧，然后仔细考虑了一下刚才的情况。但是过了一会儿，他又重新振作了起来，第三次伸出手拿过斧头，开始砍。但是有人第三次大声喊道：","He stopped, and felt afraid and alarmed, and pondered over the circumstance.But when a few moments had passed, he took heart again, and a third time he stretched out his hand for the axe, and began to cut.But some one called out a third time, and said loudly,"
"“砍木材做卷轴的人会死，缠线的人会亡。”","“He who cuts wood for reels shall die, And he who winds, shall perish.”"
"他听不下去了，再也没有心思干活，于是他很快从树上爬下来，动身回家。女人抄小道拼命地跑，好赶在丈夫前面先到家。就这样，当他进客厅时，她就装出一幅若无其事的样子，好像什么都没有发生过，说：“唔，你带回来一块好木材做卷轴了吗？”“没有，”他说，“我明白了，还是不要缠线的好。”并告诉她在森林里发生的事，从此以后他再也不提让她缠线的事了。然而，过了一段时间，男人又开始抱怨房子里的混乱。“媳妇，”他说，“纺好的线全都在那儿乱缠着，真是太丢人了！”“我来告诉你怎么办。”她说，“因为我们还没有卷轴，你去阁楼上，我站在下面把线扔上去给你，你把它扔下来给我，那样我们就能把线缠成一束了。”“是的，就这么办。”男人说。于是他们就照做了，做完以后，他说：“纺线缠成一团了，现在必须要把它煮开。”女人又感到很苦恼；她肯定地说：“是的，我们明天一大早就把它煮开。”但是她背地里又设计了另一个诡计。","That was enough for him, and all inclination had departed from him, so he hastily descended the tree, and set out on his way home.The woman ran as fast as she could by by-ways so as to get home first.So when he entered the parlour, she put on an innocent look as if nothing had happened, and said, “Well, have you brought a nice piece of wood for reels?”“No,” said he, “I see very well that winding won’t do,” and told her what had happened to him in the forest, and from that time forth left her in peace about it.Nevertheless after some time, the man again began to complain of the disorder in the house.“Wife,” said he, “it is really a shame that the spun yarn should lie there all entangled!”“I’ll tell you what,” said she, “as we still don’t come by any reel, go you up into the loft, and I will stand down below, and will throw the yarn up to you, and you will throw it down to me, and so we shall get a skein after all.”“Yes, that will do,” said the man.So they did that, and when it was done, he said, “The yarn is in skeins, now it must be boiled.”The woman was again distressed; She certainly said, “Yes, we will boil it next morning early.” but she was secretly contriving another trick."
"第二天一大早她就起床了，点着火，烧上一壶水，只是不是要煮线而是将一团短麻屑放了进去，把它煮开。然后她去找她的丈夫，她的丈夫还躺在床上，她对他说：“我现在必须出去一趟，你得赶紧起床，照看放在火上煮着的壶里的纱线，你要马上去；留心，因为如果鸡鸣了，你还没去照看纱线，它就会变成短麻屑。”丈夫很乐意，说做就做。他尽快起了床，来到厨房。但是，当他来壶边往里一瞥，却惊恐地发现他只看见一团短麻屑。结果这个可怜的丈夫不敢吭声，认为是他自己疏忽了，责任在他，以后再也不提纺线和缠线了。不过，你自己一定会认为她是一个可恶的女人吧！","Early in the morning she got up, lighted a fire, and put the kettle on, only instead of the yarn, she put in a lump of tow, and let it boil.After that she went to the man who was still lying in bed, and said to him, “I must just go out, you must get up and look after the yarn which is in the kettle on the fire, but you must be at hand at once; mind that, for if the cock should happen to crow, and you are not attending to the yarn, it will become tow.”The man was willing and took good care not to loiter.He got up as quickly as he could, and went into the kitchen.But when he reached the kettle and peeped in, he saw, to his horror, nothing but a lump of tow.Then the poor man was as still as a mouse, thinking he had neglected it, and was to blame, and in future said no more about yarn and spinning.But you yourself must own she was an odious woman!"
"讨饭的老婆婆","The Old Beggar-Woman"
"曾经有一个老婆婆，你以前见过老婆婆讨饭么？这个老婆婆就是那样乞讨，而且当她讨到东西的时候会说：“愿上帝恩赐于你。”这个讨饭的老婆婆来到一户人家的门前，在壁炉边上，一个友好而调皮的男孩儿正站在旁边取暖。看到这个可怜的老婆婆站在门前瑟瑟发抖，男孩儿友好地对她说：“来，老妈妈，暖和一下。”她走了进去，但是她站得离壁炉太近了，以至于她那破旧的衣服都开始着了起来，而她却没有察觉。那男孩儿站在那里看着这一切，但是他应该把火扑灭的。他是不是真的应该把火扑灭？而且即使他没有水，他也应该让全身的水从双眼中流出来，那将是两股美丽的水流，他可以借此把火扑灭。","There was once an old woman, but thou hast surely seen an old woman go a-begging before now?This woman begged likewise, and when she got anything she said, “May God reward you.”The beggar-woman came to a door, and there by the fire a friendly rogue of a boy was standing warming himself.The boy said kindly to the poor old woman as she was standing shivering thus by the door, “Come, old mother, and warm yourself.”She came in, but stood too near the fire, so that her old rags began to burn, and she was not aware of it.The boy stood and saw that, but he ought to have put the flames out.Is it not true that he ought to have put them out?And if he had not any water, then should he have wept all the water in his body out of his eyes, and that would have supplied two pretty streams with which to extinguish them."
"一群叫花子","The Pack of Ragamuffins"
"从前，有一只公鸡对一只母鸡说：“这个时候我们的坚果应该熟了，我们一起去山上，赶在松鼠把它们都摘走之前，痛痛快快地吃个饱吧。”“好啊，”母鸡回复道，“来，我们一起去开开心心地玩。”然后，他们就离开家，去了山上。那一天天气晴朗，他们一直呆到了晚上。现在，我不知道是因为他们吃得太多而长胖了，还是因为他们变得骄傲了，他们不愿意走着回家，公鸡不得不用坚果壳造了一辆马车。马车造好以后，小母鸡坐在里面，对公鸡说：“只能是你自己拉车。”“好像我喜欢拉车一样！”公鸡说，“我宁愿走回家，也不愿意自己拉车；不行，我们可没说好。我不介意坐在座位上当车夫，但是让我自己拉车，我不干。”","The cock once said to the hen, “It is now the time when our nuts are ripe, so let us go to the hill together and for once eat our fill before the squirrel takes them all away.”“Yes,” replied the hen, “come, we will have some pleasure together.”Then they went away to the hill, and on it was a bright day they stayed till evening.Now I do not know whether it was that they had eaten till they were too fat, or whether they had become proud, but they would not go home on foot, and the cock had to build a little carriage of nut-shells.When it was ready, the little hen seated herself in it and said to the cock, “Thou canst just harness thyself to it.”“I like that!” said the cock, “I would rather go home on foot than let myself be harnessed to it; no, that is not our bargain.I do not mind being coachman and sitting on the box, but drag it myself I will not.”"
"他们正这样争吵着的时候，一只鸭子嘎嘎叫着走过来：“你们这两个偷东西的家伙，谁叫你们来我的坚果山上偷坚果呢？唔，我要你们好看！”，她张着嘴向公鸡跑去。但是，公鸡也不是好惹的，他大胆地将鸭子击倒在地，最后用距把她弄伤了。小鸭子向他求饶，并愿意给他们拉车，将功折罪。现在小公鸡自己坐在驭者座上当马车夫，并催促道：“鸭子，跑得越快越好。”因此车跑得飞快。他们走了一段路后遇到了两个脚夫——一个大头针和一个缝衣针。他们大叫道：“停下来！停下来！”并且说天马上就变得漆黑了，他们再也无法继续赶路了，路上非常脏，问他们是否可以上车呆一会儿。他们在城门口裁缝家的小酒馆里喝啤酒，因此耽误了时间。因为它们都很瘦，占不了多大地方，公鸡就让它们两个进去了，但是他必须让大头针和缝衣针承诺不踩他和小母鸡的脚。深夜的时候，他们来到一家客栈，因为他们不喜欢晚上赶路，并且鸭子的脚也快撑不住了，左摇右摆地走了进去。店主一开始不让他们在那过夜，他的房子已经住满了，除此之外，店主觉得他们不是什么重要人物；但是最终他们说了很多好听的话，并告诉他会把小母鸡在路上下的蛋送给他，同时，还会把每天下一个蛋的鸭子也送给他，最后店主同意他们晚上在那过夜。现在他们叫了丰盛的饭菜，大吃大喝，欢闹作乐。一大清早，天刚蒙蒙亮，大家还都在睡觉，公鸡叫醒母鸡，带上鸡蛋，把它啄开，一起吃了，但是他们把蛋壳扔在了壁炉边。然后他们去找缝衣针，缝衣针还在睡觉，他们就抓起针头，把它扎进了店主椅子的坐垫里，并把大头针扎进他的毛巾，最后没什么可做了，他们就穿过荒野跑走了。鸭子喜欢在露天的地方睡觉，因此就呆在院子里，听到他们跑走，沾沾自喜，她发现了一条小溪，就顺着水流游走了，这比拉着车走要快多了。再过了两个小时店主才起床；他洗了个澡，想用毛巾擦干，然后大头针扎到他脸上，两个耳朵之间划了一道血印。过后，他走到厨房，想要把烟袋点着，但是当他走到壁炉前，马上就看到了鸡蛋壳。“今天早上一切都和我作对。”他说，非常生气地坐在他爷爷的椅子上，但是他很快就跳起来，大叫道：“哎呦，好疼啊！”缝衣针比大头针刺得疼多了，而且不是头部。现在，他彻底生气了，怀疑是昨天晚上很晚来投宿的客人搞的鬼，可是当他去找他们的时候，他们已经不见了。然后，他发誓再也不把一些叫花子带到他的房子里了，因为他们大吃大喝，也不付账，还对这些恩情报以恶作剧。","As they were thus disputing, a duck quacked to them, “You thieving folks, who bade you go to my nut-hill?Well, you shall suffer for it!” and ran with open beak at the cock.But the cock also was not idle, and fell boldly on the duck, and at last wounded her so with his spurs that she also begged for mercy, and willingly let herself be harnessed to the carriage as a punishment.The little cock now seated himself on the box and was coachman, and thereupon they went off in a gallop, with “Duck, go as fast as thou canst.”When they had driven a part of the way they met two foot-passengers, a pin and a needle.They cried, “Stop!stop!” and said that it would soon be as dark as pitch, and then they could not go a step further, and that it was so dirty on the road, and asked if they could not get into the carriage for a while.They had been at the tailor’s public—house by the gate, and had stayed too long over the beer.As they were thin people, who did not take up much room, the cock let them both get in, but they had to promise him and his little hen not to step on their feet.Late in the evening they came to an inn, and as they did not like to go further by night, and as the duck also was not strong on her feet, and fell from one side to the other, they went in.The host at first made many objections, his house was already full, besides he thought they could not be very distinguished persons; but at last, as they made pleasant speeches, and told him that he should have the egg which the little hen has laid on the way, and should likewise keep the duck, which laid one every day, he at length said that they might stay the night.And now they had themselves well served, and feasted and rioted.Early in the morning, when day was breaking, and every one was asleep, the cock awoke the hen, brought the egg, pecked it open, and they ate it together, but they threw the shell on the hearth.Then they went to the needle which was still asleep, took it by the head and stuck it into the cushion of the landlord’s chair, and put the pin in his towel, and at the last without more ado they flew away over the heath.The duck who liked to sleep in the open air and had stayed in the yard, heard them going away, made herself merry and found a stream, down which she swam, which was a much quicker way of travelling than being harnessed to a carriage.The host did not get out of bed for two hours after this; he washed himself and wanted to dry himself, then the pin went over his face and made a red streak from one ear to the other.After this he went into the kitchen and wanted to light a pipe, but when he came to the hearth the egg-shell darted into his eyes.“This morning everything attacks my head, “ said he, and angrily sat down on his grandfather’s chair, but he quickly started up again and cried, “Woe is me, “ for the needle had pricked him still worse than the pin, and not in the head.Now he was thoroughly angry, and suspected the guests who had come so late the night before, and when he went and looked about for them, they were gone.Then he made a vow to take no more ragamuffins into his house, for they consume much, pay for nothing, and play mischievous tricks into the bargain by way of gratitude."
"天堂的礼遇","The Peasant in Heaven"
"从前有个虔诚的贫农过世了，他来到了天堂大门前。与此同时，一位非常富有的地主也来到这里，他也想进天堂。圣彼得拿着钥匙来了，打开大门，让富人进去，但是很显然他没有看见农民，就把门关上了。现在农民在门外听见天堂里面大家为富人的到来而欢呼雀跃，他们奏着美妙的音乐，唱着歌。最后一切又变得很安静，圣彼得又来打开天堂之门，让农民进来。农民期待着进去时大家也能弹奏美妙的音乐，为他唱歌，但是一切都还是那么安静，大家都热情接待他，真的，天使也都来看望他，但是没人唱歌。于是农民问圣彼得为什么富人进来时大家为他歌唱而他进来时没人唱歌，他还说对他来说天堂的一切都跟地上一样不公平。然后圣彼得说道：“绝不是那样的，对我们来说，你和其他人一样珍贵，会享受到富人所享受到的一切天堂般的快乐，但是每天都会有像你这样的穷人来到天堂，但是像他那样的富人一百年里最多才来一次！”","Once on a time a poor pious peasant died, and arrived before the gate of heaven.At the same time a very rich, rich lord came there who also wanted to get into heaven.Then Saint Peter came with the key, and opened the door, and let the great man in, but apparently did not see the peasant, and shut the door again.And now the peasant outside, heard how the great man was received in heaven with all kinds of rejoicing, and how they were making music, and singing within.At length all became quiet again, and Saint Peter came and opened the gate of heaven, and let the peasant in.The peasant, however, expected that they would make music and sing when he went in also, but all remained quite quiet; he was received with great affection, it is true, and the angels came to meet him, but no one sang.Then the peasant asked Saint Peter how it was that they did not sing for him as they had done when the rich man went in, and said that it seemed to him that there in heaven things were done with just as much partiality as on earth.Then said Saint Peter, “By no means, thou art just as dear to us as any one else, and wilt enjoy every heavenly delight that the rich man enjoys, but poor fellows like thee come to heaven every day, but a rich man like this does not come more than once in a hundred years!”"
"蜂王","The Queen Bee"
"从前，国王的两个儿子出去历险，却过起了狂野、无序的生活，因此他们再也没有回过家。最小的王子叫“笨蛋”，动身找他的哥哥们，但是最后当他找到他们时，他们却嘲笑他，觉得他那么单纯，很难在世界上过活。他们两个比他聪明得多，都快混不下去了，更别提他了。他们三个一起上路，来到了一个蚁冢前。年长的两个想要捣毁它，看看小蚂蚁们在恐惧之中到处乱爬，并把它们的蚁卵带走的情形，但是“笨蛋”却说：“让这些生物平静地生活吧；我不允许你们打扰它们。”然后，他们继续向前走，来到了一个湖边，湖里有很多鸭子在游泳。两个哥哥想要抓一对，烤了吃，但是“笨蛋”不允许，他说：“让这些生物平静地生活吧，我不能忍受你们杀死它们。”后来，他们来到了一个蜂窝前，蜂窝里有很多蜂蜜，多得都从蜂窝顺着树干流出来了。他们两个想在树下生火，闷死那些蜜蜂，好把蜂蜜取走，但是“笨蛋”又阻止了他们，说道：“让这些生物平静生活吧，我不允许你们烧死它们。”最后，三兄弟来到了一个城堡，城堡的马棚里站着很多石头马，却不见有一个人，他们穿过了所有的大厅，走到最里面的那个门前，门上有三把锁。不过，门的中间有一个小窗口，从那儿他们可以看到房间里的情形。在那儿，他们看到一个灰白头发的小矮人坐在桌子前。他们叫他，一次，两次，但是他没有听到，最后他们叫他第三次的时候，他起身，打开锁，走了出来。但是，他什么也没说，只是把他们带到一张摆满了美味佳肴的桌子前，等他们吃饱喝足后，小矮人又给他们每人安排了一间卧室。第二天早上，灰白头发的小矮人来到年纪最长的面前，打手势叫他，并把他带到一个石桌子前，桌子上刻着三个任务，完成这三个任务才能拯救城堡。第一个任务是，在森林里，苔藓下面，放置着公主的一千粒珍珠，他必须把它们拾起来，如果日落之前还有一颗珍珠没找到，那么找珍珠的人就会变成石头。老大就去了，找了一整天，但是日落前他只找到了一百颗，刻在石桌上的话应验了，他变成了石头。第二天，老二承担了这项任务。然而，他的表现比老大强不了多少。他找到了不足两百颗珍珠，也变成了石头。最后轮到“笨蛋”在苔藓中找珍珠了。但是，找齐珍珠太困难了，他的进展非常缓慢，于是他坐在一块石头上哭了起来。就在这时候，他曾经救过的蚁王带了五千只蚂蚁来了。不一会儿，这些小东西就把所有的珍珠都找到了，堆在一起。第二个任务是从湖里取出国王女儿卧室的钥匙。当“笨蛋”来到湖边时，他曾经救过的鸭子朝他游过来，潜到水里，把钥匙从水里取了出来。但是，第三个任务是最困难的：从三个熟睡的公主里挑出年龄最小、最可爱的那个。可是，她们三个人长得一模一样，只能通过她们睡前吃的不同的蜜饯来区分：大公主吃了一点儿糖；二公主吃了一点儿糖浆；小公主吃了一勺蜂蜜。“笨蛋”曾经保护蜂王逃过火灾，所以蜂王飞过来，在三位公主的嘴唇上分别尝了尝，最后它停留在吃了蜂蜜的公主的嘴唇上，于是王子意识到这位就是他要找的公主。然后，魔咒消失了；所有人都醒了，那些变成石头的人也恢复了原来的模样。“笨蛋”娶了那位年龄最小、最可爱的公主，在她父亲死后继成了王位，他的两个哥哥也娶了另外两位公主。","Two kings’ sons once went out in search of adventures, and fell into a wild, disorderly way of living, so that they never came home again.The youngest, who was called Simpleton, set out to seek his brothers, but when at length he found them they mocked him for thinking that he with his simplicity could get through the world, when they two could not make their way, and yet were so much cleverer.They all three travelled away together, and came to an ant-hill.The two elder wanted to destroy it, to see the little ants creeping about in their terror, and carrying their eggs away, but Simpleton said, “Leave the creatures in peace; I will not allow you to disturb them.”Then they went onwards and came to a lake, on which a great number of ducks were swimming.The two brothers wanted to catch a couple and roast them, but Simpleton would not permit it, and said, “ Leave the creatures in peace, I will not suffer you to kill them.”At length they came to a bee’s nest, in which there was so much honey that it ran out of the trunk of the tree where it was.The two wanted to make a fire beneath the tree, and suffocate the bees in order to take away the honey, but Simpleton again stopped them and said, “Leave the creatures in peace, I will not allow you to burn them.”At length the three brothers arrived at a castle where stone horses were standing in the stables, and no human being was to be seen, and they went through all the halls until, quite at the end, they came to a door in which were three locks.In the middle of the door, however, there was a little pane, through which they could see into the room.There they saw a little grey man, who was sitting at a table.They called him, once, twice, but he did not hear; at last they called him for the third time, when he got up, opened the locks, and came out.He said nothing, however, but conducted them to a handsomely-spread table, and when they had eaten and drunk, he took each of them to a bedroom.Next morning the little grey man came to the eldest, beckoned to him, and conducted him to a stone table, on which were inscribed three tasks, by the performance of which the castle could be delivered.The first was that in the forest, beneath the moss, lay the princess’s pearls, a thousand in number, which must be picked up, and if by sunset one single pearl was wanting, he who had looked for them would be turned into stone.The eldest went thither, and sought the whole day, but when it came to an end, he had only found one hundred, and what was written on the table came to pass, and he was changed into stone.Next day, the second brother undertook the adventure; it did not, however, fare much better with him than with the eldest; he did not find more than two hundred pearls, and was changed to stone.At last the turn came to Simpleton also, who sought in the moss.It was, however, so hard to find the pearls, and he got on so slowly, that he seated himself on a stone, and wept.And while he was thus sitting, the King of the ants whose life he had once saved, came with five thousand ants, and before long the little creatures had got all the pearls together, and laid them in a heap.The second task, however, was to fetch out of the lake the key of the King’s daughter’s bed-chamber.When Simpleton came to the lake, the ducks which he had saved, swam up to him, dived down, and brought the key out of the water.But the third task was the most difficult; from amongst the three sleeping daughters of the King was the youngest and dearest to be sought out.They, however, resembled each other exactly, and were only to be distinguished by their having eaten different sweetmeats before they fell asleep; the eldest a bit of sugar; the second a little syrup; and the youngest a spoonful of honey.Then the Queen of the bees, which Simpleton had protected from the fire, came and tasted the lips of all three, and at last she remained sitting on the mouth which had eaten honey, and thus the King’s son recognized the right princess.Then the enchantment was at an end; everything was released from sleep, and those who had been turned to stone received once more their natural forms.Simpleton married the youngest and sweetest princess, and after her father’s death became King, and his two brothers received the two other sisters."
"海兔","The Sea-Hare"
"从前，有一位公主，她在城堡里那高高的城垛下有一个房间，房间共有十二扇窗户，这些窗户尽可能朝向每一个方向。每当公主登上这个房间、环视四周时，她就可以视察她的整个王国。当她从第一个窗户往外看时，她的视觉比其他任何人都要敏锐，从第二个窗户她能看得更清，从第三个就看得更清楚了，就这样以此类推，从第十二个窗户向外望去，她可以看到地上地下的所有东西，没有什么能够逃脱她的眼睛。此外，由于她很高傲且不愿受人支配，只想独自一人统治王国，她宣布，谁要想成为他的丈夫，就得成功地把自己隐藏起来，绝不能让她找到。然而，凡是想要尝试却最终被她找到的人都要被砍头，砍下的头要被钉在一根柱子上。城堡前已经立了九十七根柱子，每根柱子上都有一颗死人头，所以有很长一段时间没人敢来尝试了。公主很高兴，心想：“我活着的时候，就没人管得了我了。”这时有三兄弟来到她面前，宣称他们也想碰碰运气。老大相信只要爬进一个石灰池，他就会很安全，但是公主从第一个窗户就看到他了，差人把他抓了出来，砍了他的头。老二爬进了宫殿的地下室，但是公主也只从第一个窗户就发现了他，他的命运也便成了定局。他的头被钉在了第九十九根柱子上。之后老三来了，他恳求公主给他一天时间考虑，而且如果公主碰巧找到了他的话，希望她能宽恕他两次，但要是他第三次还失败了，他甘愿受死。因为他长得很英俊，又恳求得如此诚恳，公主便说：“好吧，我答应你，但你不会成功的。”","There was once upon a time a princess, who, high under the battlements in her castle, had an apartment with twelve windows, which looked out in every possible direction, and when she climbed up to it and looked around her, she could inspect her whole kingdom.When she looked out of the first, her sight was more keen than that of any other human being; from the second she could see still better, from the third more distinctly still, and so it went on, until the twelfth, from which she saw everything above the earth and under the earth, and nothing at all could be kept secret from her.Moreover, as she was haughty, and would be subject to no one, but wished to keep the dominion for herself alone, she caused it to be proclaimed that no one should ever be her husband who could not conceal himself from her so effectually, that it should be quite impossible for her to find him.He who tried this, however, and was discovered by her, was to have his head struck off, and stuck on a post.Ninety-seven posts with the heads of dead men were already standing before the castle, and no one had come forward for a long time.The princess was delighted, and thought to herself, “Now I shall be free as long as I live.”Then three brothers appeared before her, and announced to her that they were desirous of trying their luck.The eldest believed he would be quite safe if he crept into a lime-pit, but she saw him from the first window, made him come out, and had his head cut off.The second crept into the cellar of the palace, but she perceived him also from the first window, and his fate was sealed.His head was placed on the nine and ninetieth post.Then the youngest came to her and entreated her to give him a day for consideration, and also to be so gracious as to overlook it if she should happen to discover him twice, but if he failed the third time, he would look on his life as over.As he was so handsome, and begged so earnestly, she said, “Yes, I will grant thee that, but thou wilt not succeed.”"
"第二天，老三想了很久怎样去隐藏自己，但什么办法都没想到。于是，他拿起枪，出门打猎去了。他看到一只乌鸦，正要瞄准它开枪，这时乌鸦大叫：“不要开枪，只要你不杀我，我会报答你的。”他放下枪，继续前行，来到一个湖边，在那里他意外地发现一条大鱼正从湖底深处游上水面。当他用枪瞄着鱼时，鱼大叫起来：“不要开枪，我会报答你的。”他让鱼又潜回了深水中，继续往前走，又遇到了一只瘸了腿的狐狸。他向它开了一枪但没有打中，狐狸叫了起来：“你行行好，过来帮我把脚上的刺拔了吧。”他帮狐狸拔了刺，不过他还是想杀了它、取它的皮，狐狸马上说：“不要杀我，我会报答你的。”小伙子放了它，这时天也黑了，他只好回家了。","Next day he meditated for a long time how he should hide himself, but all in vain.Then he seized his gun and went out hunting.He saw a raven, took a good aim at him, and was just going to fire, when the bird cried, “Don’t shoot; I will make it worth thy while not to kill me.”He put his gun down, went on, and came to a lake where he surprised a large fish which had come up from the depths below to the surface of the water.When he had aimed at it, the fish cried, “Don’t shoot, and I will make it worth thy while.”He allowed it to dive down again, went onwards, and met a fox which was lame.He fired and missed it, and the fox cried, “You had much better come here and draw the thorn out of my foot for me.”He did this; but then he wanted to kill the fox and skin it, the fox said, “Stop, and I will make it worth thy while.”The youth let him go, and then as it was evening, returned home."
"第二天，他该把自己藏起来了，但是不管他怎样绞尽脑汁，还是不知道藏在哪里好。他去森林里找到了乌鸦，说：“我放了你一条生路，现在你告诉我，该藏到哪里，好让公主找不到我。”乌鸦低着头思索了很久。最后，它呱呱叫道：“我有办法了！”乌鸦从巢里拿出一颗蛋，切成了两半，把小伙子关在里面，然后把蛋合了起来，自己坐了上去。公主来到第一个窗户，她没能找到他，其他几个里也找不到，她开始有些不安，但是，从第十一个窗户中，她发现了他。她下令射死了乌鸦，并把蛋拿来打碎，小伙子不得不出来了。公主说：“第一次我赦免你，但是下次你不藏好点，你就输定了！”","Next day he was to hide himself; but howsoever much he puzzled his brains over it, he did not know where.He went into the forest to the raven and said, “I let thee live on, so now tell me where I am to hide myself, so that the King’s daughter shall not see me.”The raven hung his head and thought it over for a longtime.At length he croaked, “I have it.”He fetched an egg out of his nest, cut it into two parts, and shut the youth inside it; then made it whole again, and seated himself on it.When the King’s daughter went to the first window she could not discover him, nor could she from the others, and she began to be uneasy, but from the eleventh she saw him.She ordered the raven to be shot, and the egg to be brought and broken, and the youth was forced to come out.She said, “For once thou art excused, but if thou dost not do better than this, thou art lost!”"
"第二天，他来到湖边把鱼叫了出来，说：“我放了你一条生路，现在告诉我，该藏到哪里，好让公主找不到我。”鱼想了一会儿，最后叫道：“我有办法了！我将把你关进我的肚子里。”鱼吞下小伙子，游到了湖底。公主从她的窗户往外看，可即使到了第十一个窗户还没找到他，公主不由得惊慌起来，但她最后还是从第十二个窗户里发现了他。她下令把鱼捉来杀了，小伙子就出来了。任何人都能想象到他是什么心情。公主说：“第二次我还放过你，但是你的头终究会被钉在第一百根柱子上。”","Next day he went to the lake, called the fish to him and said, “I suffered thee to live, now tell me where to hide myself so that the King’s daughter may not see me.”The fish thought for a while, and at last cried, “I have it!I will shut thee up in my stomach.”He swallowed him, and went down to the bottom of the lake.The King’s daughter looked through her windows, and even from the eleventh did not see him, and was alarmed; but at length from the twelfth she saw him.She ordered the fish to be caught and killed, and then the youth appeared.Every one can imagine what a state of mind he was in.She said, “Twice thou art forgiven, but be sure that thy head will be set on the hundredth post.”"
"最后一天，他心情沉重地回到了村里，遇到了狐狸。“你最了解怎样寻找各种藏身的地方，”他说，“我放了你一条生路，现在给我点建议，我该藏到哪里，好让公主找不到我。”“这真是个难题。”狐狸若有所思地答道。最后，它叫道：“我有办法了！”接着它和小伙子一起来到了一个泉水边，狐狸让自己在泉水里泡了泡，出来就变成了一个专门贩卖小动物的集市商贩。小伙子也不得不在水里泡了一下，然后变成了一只小海兔。这个商贩来到了市区，把这只可爱的小动物拿出来展出，很多人都聚过来围观。最后，公主也来了，因为她很喜欢这只小海兔，便给了商贩一大笔钱，把它买了下来。把海兔交给公主之前，商贩对海兔说：“当公主走向窗户时，你就赶紧爬到她的发辫下面去。”现在到了公主搜寻小伙子的时间了。公主依次走过每个窗户，从第一个到第十一个窗户，她都没有看到他。当从第十二个窗户也没能看到他时，公主气急败坏，猛地一把关上窗户，所有的窗玻璃都被震得支离破碎，连整个城堡都在摇晃。","On the last day, he went with a heavy heart into the country, and met the fox.“Thou knowest how to find all kinds of hiding-places,” said he; “I let thee live, now advise me where I shall hide myself so that the King’s daughter shall not discover me.”“That’s a hard task,” answered the fox, looking very thoughtful.At length he cried, “I have it!” and went with him to a spring, dipped himself in it, and came out as a stall-keeper in the market, and dealer in animals.The youth had to dip himself in the water also, and was changed into a small sea-hare.The merchant went into the town, and showed the pretty little animal, and many persons gathered together to see it.At length the King’s daughter came likewise, and as she liked it very much, she bought it, and gave the merchant a good deal of money for it.Before he gave it over to her, he said to it, “When the King’s daughter goes to the window, creep quickly under the braids of her hair.”And now the time arrived when she was to search for him.She went to one window after another in turn, from the first to the eleventh, and did not see him.When she did not see him from the twelfth either, she was full of anxiety and anger, and shut it down with such violence that the glass in every window shivered into a thousand pieces, and the whole castle shook."
"她往回走时，发现海兔在她的发辫下面。于是，她一把抓住它扔在地上，大声吼道：“滚开，从我眼前消失！”海兔跑回了商贩那里，他们便一起匆匆赶到泉水边，跳了进去，然后就恢复了他们自己的真实模样。小伙子谢过了狐狸，说道：“和你相比，乌鸦和鱼都太笨了，毫无疑问，你最有办法！”","She went back and felt the sea-hare beneath the braids of her hair.Then she seized it, and threw it on the ground exclaiming, “Away with thee, get out of my sight!”It ran to the merchant, and both of them hurried to the spring, wherein they plunged, and received back their true forms.The youth thanked the fox, and said, “The raven and the fish are idiots compared with thee; thou knowest the right tune to play, there is no denying that!”"
"小伙子径直来到了宫殿。公主已经在等着他了，她愿意服从命运的安排。婚礼举行得非常隆重，现在小伙子成了国王，统领着整个国家。他从没告诉过公主他第三次藏在了哪里，是谁帮助了他，因此她一直以为他所做的一切都是完全依靠自己的本事，所以她十分钦佩他，心中暗想：“他比我有本事多了。”","The youth went straight to the palace.The princess was already expecting him, and accommodated herself to her destiny.The wedding was solemnized, and now he was king, and lord of all the kingdom.He never told her where he had concealed himself for the third time, and who had helped him, so she believed that he had done everything by his own skill, and she had a great respect for him, for she thought to herself, “He is able to do more than I.”"
"会唱歌的骨头","The Singing Bone"
"从前，有一个国家受到野猪的危害，举国悲叹。野猪破坏农民的田地，咬死家畜，还用他那獠牙把许多人都撕碎了。国王许诺会重赏能让这片土地摆脱这一祸害的人；但是野猪肢体庞大，非常强壮，没有人敢靠近它住的森林。最后，国王贴出告示，谁能够将野猪捕获或者杀死，谁就可以娶他唯一的女儿做妻子。","In a certain country there was once great lamentation over a wild boar that laid waste the farmer’s fields, killed the cattle, and ripped up people’s bodies with his tusks.The King promised a large reward to anyone who would free the land from this plague; but the beast was so big and strong that no one dared to go near the forest in which it lived.At last the King gave notice that whosoever should capture or kill the wild boar should have his only daughter to wife."
"在这个国家里生活着两兄弟，他们是穷人的儿子，两兄弟声称愿意去冒这个险；哥哥狡诈、精明，做这件事是出于自负；弟弟，单纯、朴实，做这件事是出于善心。国王说：“为了能够确保你们找到野兽，你们俩必须从森林的两边分别进入。”因此哥哥从西边进入森林，弟弟则从东边进入。","Now there lived in the country two brothers, sons of a poor man, who declared themselves willing to undertake the hazardous enterprise; the elder, who was crafty and shrewd, out of pride; the younger, who was innocent and simple, from a kind heart.The King said, “In order that you may be the more sure of finding the beast, you must go into the forest from opposite sides.”So the elder went in on the west side, and the younger on the east."
"当弟弟走了一小段路后，一个小矮人走向他。他手里握着一杆黑色的长矛，说：“因为你的心纯洁、善良，我将这把长矛送给你。用这把长矛你就能大胆地袭击野猪，并且不会被它所伤了。”","When the younger had gone a short way, a little man stepped up to him.He held in his hand a black spear and said, “I give you this spear because your heart is pure and good; with this you can boldly attack the wild boar, and it will do you no harm.”"
"他谢过了小矮人，扛起长矛，勇敢地往前走。","He thanked the little man, shouldered the spear, and went on fearlessly."
"不久，他就看到野猪向他冲过来；但是他握紧长矛对准它，野猪发了狂似的朝他猛跑过去，心脏被长矛刺成了两半。于是，他把野猪背在身上，往家走，要把它献给国王。","Before long he saw the beast, which rushed at him; but he held the spear towards it, and in its blind fury it ran so swiftly against it that its heart was cloven in twain.Then he took the monster on his back and went homewards with it to the King."
"他从树林的另一边走出来，在入口处有一座房子，人们都在那里饮酒、跳舞作乐。他的哥哥也在这里，哥哥觉得反正野猪也不会逃走，就在这里喝酒来壮胆。但是，当他看见他的弟弟带着战利品从树林里走出来，他那颗满怀妒忌的、邪恶的心使他无法平静。他大声叫弟弟：“快进来，亲爱的弟弟，过来休息一下，喝杯葡萄酒提提神。”","As he came out at the other side of the wood, there stood at the entrance a house where people were making merry with wine and dancing.His elder brother had gone in here, and, thinking that after all the boar would not run away from him, was going to drink until he felt brave.But when he saw his young brother coming out of the wood laden with his booty, his envious, evil heart gave him no peace.He called out to him, “Come in, dear brother, rest and refresh yourself with a cup of wine.”"
"弟弟从不知道邪恶为何物，走进去告诉他有个好心的小矮人给了他一杆长矛，他就是用那长矛杀死了野猪。","The youth, who suspected no evil, went in and told him about the good little man who had given him the spear wherewith he had slain the boar."
"他的哥哥一直留他到了晚上，然后他们就一起走了，黑暗中他们走到横跨小溪的桥上，哥哥让弟弟先过，当他的弟弟刚走到中间的时候，他就从背后重击他，弟弟就摔下去死了。他把弟弟埋在桥下面，拿走野猪，把它献给了国王，装作是他杀死了野猪，就这样他娶了国王的女儿做妻子。他的弟弟没能回来，他就说：“一定是野猪把他杀死了。”大家也都信以为真。","The elder brother kept him there until the evening, and then they went away together, and when in the darkness they came to a bridge over a brook, the elder brother let the other go first; and when he was half-way across he gave him such a blow from behind that he fell down dead.He buried him beneath the bridge, took the boar, and carried it to the King, pretending that he had killed it; whereupon he obtained the King’s daughter in marriage.And when his younger brother did not come back he said, “The boar must have killed him,” and every one believed it."
"但是，就像没有什么事可以瞒过上帝一样，这种恶劣的行为也会有暴露的一天。","But as nothing remains hidden from God, so this black deed also was to come to light."
"很多年后，一个牧羊人赶着羊群从桥上过，看到下面沙子里埋着一根雪白的骨头。他觉得用它可以做一个很好的乐器吹口，他就爬下去，把它捡起来，修刻成了他的号角的吹口。但是，当他第一次吹的时候，让他感到惊奇的是，骨头开始自己唱起歌来：","Years afterwards a shepherd was driving his herd across the bridge, and saw lying in the sand beneath, a snow-white little bone.He thought that it would make a good mouth-piece, so he clambered down, picked it up, and cut out of it a mouth-piece for his horn.But when he blew through it for the first time, to his great astonishment, the bone began of its own accord to sing:"
"“啊，朋友，你对着我的骨头吹号角！我在水边被放置了很久，我的哥哥为了得到野猪杀了我，还娶了国王年轻的女儿做他的妻子。”","“Ah, friend, thou blowest upon my bone!Long have I lain beside the water; My brother slew me for the boar, And took for his wife the King’s young daughter.”"
"牧羊人说：“好奇妙的号角啊！自己会唱歌；我一定要带它去见我的国王。”当他带着号角见了国王，号角再次开始唱起那支小歌曲。国王全都明白了，让人挖开桥下的地面，被谋杀的人的整个骸骨重见天日。邪恶的哥哥不能否认这种行为，被缝到一个大口袋里淹死了。但是，被杀的人的骸骨被安葬在教堂墓地中的一个美丽的墓穴里。","“What a wonderful horn!” said the shepherd; “it sings by itself; I must take it to my lord the King.”And when he came with it to the King the horn again began to sing its little song.The King understood it all, and caused the ground below the bridge to be dug up, and then the whole skeleton of the murdered man came to light.The wicked brother could not deny the deed, and was sewn up in a sack and drowned.But the bones of the murdered man were laid to rest in a beautiful tomb in the churchyard."
"失窃的两个铜子儿","The Stolen Farthings"
"一日，夫妻俩和孩子们坐着一块吃午饭，席上还有一位来拜访他们的好朋友。就在他们这么坐着吃饭的时候，时钟敲了十二下，这时客人看见门开了，一个面色苍白、身着白衣的小孩进了屋。小男孩没有环顾四周，也没有说话，径直走进了旁边的一个房间。过了一会儿，他从房间里走了出来，又和来时一样，悄无声息地从大门走了出去。接下来的两天，这个小孩都像第一天那样，悄悄地来，又悄悄地走。终于，这位客人张口询问父亲，那个长得很漂亮、每天正午时分走进旁边房间的小孩到底是谁家的。父亲说：“我从来没有看见过他。”又说他也不知道那小孩是谁家的。又过了一天，小孩再次走进屋里，客人把他指给父亲看，但父亲看不见他，母亲和孩子们也同样看不见。这时候，客人起身走到旁边房间的门口，把门开了条小缝，从门缝往里看。他看见那个小孩坐在地板上，奋力地在地板的裂缝里挖着，好像在寻找什么东西。但是小孩一看见他就消失不见了。然后，客人告诉这家人他看到的情景，并详细描述了这个小孩的样子，这么一来母亲便知道他是谁了，她说道：“唉，这是我的宝贝儿子啊。他一个月前刚过世。”于是他们把地板打开，在地板下找到了两个铜子儿。这是有一次小孩从母亲那得到的，他本想把它们送给一个穷人，可又想到：“你可以用这钱给自己买一个小甜饼。”他就把这钱留下来，藏在地板的缝隙里。因为惦记着这两个铜子儿，小孩在坟墓里不得安息，就每天正午回来找。父母马上把这两个铜子儿给了一个穷人，从那以后，这小孩再也没有回来过。","A father was one day sitting at dinner with his wife and his children, and a good friend who had come on a visit was with them.And as they thus sat, and it was striking twelve o’clock, the stranger saw the door open, and a very pale child dressed in snow-white clothes came in.It did not look around, and it did not speak; but went straight into the next room.Soon afterwards it came back, and went out at the door again in the same quiet manner.On the second and on the third day, it came also exactly in the same way.At last the stranger asked the father to whom the beautiful child that went into the next room every day at noon belonged.“I have never seen it,” said he, neither did he know to whom it could belong.The next day when it again came, the stranger pointed it out to the father, who however did not see it, and the mother and the children also all saw nothing.On this the stranger got up, went to the room door, opened it a little, and peeped in.Then he saw the child sitting on the ground, and digging and seeking about industriously amongst the crevices between the boards of the floor, but when it saw the stranger, it disappeared.He now told what he had seen and described the child exactly, and the mother recognized it, and said, “Ah, it is my dear child who died a month ago.”They took up the boards and found two farthings which the child had once received from its mother that it might give them to a poor man; it, however, had thought, “Thou canst buy thyself a biscuit for that,” and had kept the farthings, and hidden them in the openings between the boards; and therefore it had had no rest in its grave, and had come every day at noon to seek for these farthings.The parents gave the money at once to a poor man, and after that the child was never seen again."
"狐狸太太的婚礼","The Wedding of Mrs. Fox"
"故事之一","FIRST STORY"
"很久以前，有一只九条尾巴的老狐狸，他认为太太对他不忠，想要试探一下她。他四肢伸展，躺在长凳下，一动不动，表现得像是完全死了一样。狐狸太太走到她的房间里，把自己关起来，她的侍女，猫小姐坐在火旁烧饭。当大家都知道老狐狸死了，求爱者便纷纷而至。侍女听到有人站在房门前敲门。她走过去，把门打开，是个年轻的狐狸，他说：","There was once upon a time an old fox with nine tails, who believed that his wife was not faithful to him, and wished to try her.He stretched himself out under the bench, did not move a limb, and behaved as if he were stone dead.Mrs. Fox went up to her room, shut herself in, and her maid, Miss Cat, sat by the fire, and did the cooking.When it became known that the old fox was dead, wooers presented themselves.The maid heard some one standing at the house-door, knocking.She went and opened it, and it was a young fox, who said,"
"“猫小姐，你在忙些什么？是睡着呢，还是醒着呢？”","“What may you be about, Miss Cat.?Do you sleep or do you wake?”"
"她回答：","She answered,"
"“我没睡觉，我醒着呢，你想知道我在做什么吗？我在热啤酒，再加些奶油，味道好极了，先生也要进来喝点吗？”","“I am not sleeping, I am waking, Wouldst thou know what I am making?I am boiling warm beer with butter so nice, Will the gentleman enter and drink some likewise?”"
"“不，谢谢你，小姐。”狐狸说，“狐狸太太正在做什么？”侍女回答道：","“No, thank you, miss,” said the fox, “what is Mrs. Fox doing?”The maid replied,"
"“她自己坐着，呜咽，把她的小眼睛哭得通红，因为老狐狸先生死了。”","“She sits all alone, And makes her moan, Weeping her little eyes quite red, Because old Mr. Fox is dead.”"
"“一定要告诉她，小姐，有个年轻的狐狸在这儿，想向她求爱。”“一定，年轻先生。”","“Do just tell her, miss, that a young fox is here, who would like to woo her.”“Certainly, young sir.”"
"猫蹑手蹑脚地上了楼，她轻轻地敲门：“女主人，你在里面吗？”“噢，是的，我的小猫。”她叫道。“一个求爱者站在门口。”","The cat goes up the stairs trip, trap, The door she knocks at tap, tap, tap, “Mistress Fox, are you inside?”“Oh yes, my little cat,” she cried.“A wooer he stands at the door out there.”"
"“亲爱的，告诉我他长得什么样？”","“Tell me what he is like, my dear?”"
"“可是他有像老狐狸一样的九条美丽的尾巴吗？”“噢，不，”猫答道，“他只有一条尾巴。”","“But has he nine as beautiful tails as the late Mr. Fox?”“Oh, no,” answered the cat, “he has only one.”"
"“那么我不愿意。”猫小姐下楼把求爱者送走了。过了一会儿，又有人敲门，另外一只狐狸也想向狐狸太太求爱。他有两条尾巴，但是他的结果比第一个好不了多少。这之后来了更多狐狸，每只都比前一个多一条尾巴，但是他们全都被谢绝了，直到最后来了一个像老狐狸似的长着九条尾巴的。当寡妇狐狸听到后，她高兴地对猫说：","“Then I will not have him.”Miss Cat went downstairs and sent the wooer away.Soon afterwards there was another knock, and another fox was at the door who wished to woo Mrs. Fox.He had two tails, but he did not fare better than the first.After this still more came, each with one tail more than the other, but they were all turned away, until at last one came who had nine tails, like old Mr. Fox.When the widow heard that, she said joyfully to the cat,"
"“现在把所有的门窗都大敞开，把老狐狸带到外面去。”","“Now open the gates and doors all wide, And carry old Mr. Fox outside.”"
"但是恰到婚礼举行的时候，凳子下的老狐狸活过来了，用棍子把所有的乌合之众和狐狸太太都赶出了房子。","But just as the wedding was going to be solemnized, old Mr. Fox stirred under the bench, and cudgelled all the rabble, and drove them and Mrs. Fox out of the house."
"故事之二","SECOND STORY"
"老狐狸死了之后，狼来求爱，他敲门，狐狸太太的仆人猫给他开了门。狼向她打招呼，说：","When old Mr. Fox was dead, the wolf came as a wooer, and knocked at the door, and the cat who was servant to Mrs. Fox, opened it for him.The wolf greeted her, and said,"
"“你好，打扫卫生的猫太太，你怎么一个人坐着呢？你在做什么好东西呢？”","“Good day, Mrs. Cat of Kehrewit, How comes it that alone you sit?What are you making good?”"
"猫回答道：","The cat replied,"
"“我在牛奶里掰了些味道特别甜美的面包，先生请进来吃点吧？”","“In milk I’m breaking bread so sweet, Will the gentleman please come in and eat?”"
"“不了，谢谢你，猫太太。”狼回答道，“狐狸太太不在家？”","“No, thank you, Mrs. Cat,” answered the wolf.“Is Mrs. Fox not at home?”"
"猫说：","The cat said,"
"“她在她楼上的房间里坐着，她正在叹息她那令人伤心的命运，","“She sits upstairs in her room, Bewailing her sorrowful doom,"
"叹息她那无比痛心的苦恼，因为老狐狸先生已经不在了。”","Bewailing her trouble so sore, For old Mr. Fox is no more.”"
"狼回答：","The wolf answered,"
"“如果她现在需要一个丈夫，那么能不能请她下楼来？”猫很快跑上楼，尾巴来回摆动，一直跑到客厅门口。","“If she’s in want of a husband now, Then will it please her to step below?”The cat runs quickly up the stair, And lets her tail fly here and there, Until she comes to the parlour door."
"用她那戴着五个金戒指的手敲了敲门：“你在里面吗，善良的女主人？如果你现在需要一个丈夫，那么请你下楼来好吗？”","With her five gold rings at the door she knocks, “Are you within, good Mistress Fox?If you’re in want of a husband now, Then will it please you to step below?”"
"狐狸太太问道：“那位先生是不是穿着红色的袜子，长着尖尖的嘴巴？”“不是。”猫回答。“那么他不适合我。”","Mrs. Fox asked, “Has the gentleman red stockings on and has he a pointed mouth?”“No,” answered the cat.“Then he won’t do for me.”"
"狼走了以后，来了一条狗，一只雄鹿，一只野兔，一只熊，一头狮子，还有森林里所有的野兽都相继来向她求爱。但是，他们都缺少老狐狸先生身上的一个优点，猫就相继把求爱者都赶走了。最后来了一个年轻的狐狸。狐狸太太说：“那位先生是不是穿着红袜子，还长着尖尖的嘴巴？”“是的，”猫说，“他是。”“那么让他上楼来。”狐狸太太说，并令仆人准备婚宴。","When the wolf was gone, came a dog, a stag, a hare, a bear, a lion, and all the beasts of the forest, one after the other.But one of the good points which old Mr. Fox had possessed, was always lacking, and the cat had continually to send the wooers away.At length came a young fox.Then Mrs. Fox said, “Has the gentleman red stockings on, and has he a little pointed mouth?”“Yes,” said the cat, “he has.”“Then let him come upstairs,” said Mrs. Fox, and ordered the servant to prepare the wedding-feast."
"“把屋子尽可能地打扫干净，从窗户那儿把老狐狸扔出去！因为他带回来很多美味的肥老鼠，但他从未考虑过他的妻子，自己全都吃光了。”","“Sweep me the room as clean as you can, Up with the window, fling out my old man!For many a fine fat mouse he brought, Yet of his wife he never thought, But ate up every one he caught.”"
"于是，狐狸太太和年轻狐狸先生的婚礼举行了，他们非常高兴，跳起舞来；如果他们一直没有停下来，那么到了今天他们还在跳着呢。","Then the wedding was solemnized with young Mr. Fox, and there was much rejoicing and dancing; and if they have not left off, they are dancing still."
"任性的孩子","The Wilful Child"
"从前，有个任性的小孩，从不做妈妈让她做的事情。因为她太不听话，上帝一点也不喜欢她，就让她生重病，任何医生都治不好她。很快地，这个孩子便不治而终了。当人们将她下葬入墓，为她撒上尘土时，孩子的手突然伸了出来，而且还直直地向上举着。人们想把它放进去，再撒些土，可根本不管用，因为她的手臂总是再次从里面伸出来。后来，只有让孩子的妈妈亲自到她的坟墓边用荆条抽打她的手臂，果然，在妈妈打了她的手臂后，她终于把手收了回去，并安静地在地下长眠。","Once upon a time there was a child who was willful, and would not do what her mother wished.For this reason God had no pleasure in her, and let her become ill, and no doctor could do her any good, and in a short time she lay on her death-bed.When she had been lowered into her grave, and the earth was spread over her, all at once her arm came out again, and stretched upwards, and when they had put it in and spread fresh earth over it, it was all to no purpose, for the arm always came out again.Then the mother herself was obliged to go to the grave, and strike the arm with a rod, and when she had done that, it was drawn in, and then at last the child had rest beneath the ground."
"机智的仆人","The Wise Servant"
"如果一个主人能有一个听从命令却不拘泥于命令，善于运用自身智慧的聪明仆人，那他该是多么幸运，他的家务该被处理地多么井井有条啊。聪明的约翰就是这类仆人，他的主人曾经派他去寻找一头走失的奶牛。他离开了很长时间，他的主人想：“忠实的约翰工作太努力了！”然而，因为他始终没有回来，主人开始担心他遇到危险，于是自己出去找他。他找了很久，最终却发现这个男孩正在一大块田野里跑来跑去。“现在，亲爱的约翰，”当主人走向他的时候，主人说，“你找到我让你找的奶牛了么？”“没有，主人，”他回答，“我没有找到奶牛，于是我就没有再找它。”“那你在找什么，约翰？”“更好的东西，而且我已经幸运地找到了。” “是什么，约翰？”“三只画眉鸟。”男孩说。“那它们在哪儿呢？”主人问。“我看到了一只，听见了第二只，我正在追第三只。” 这个机智的男孩答道。","How fortunate is the master, and how well all goes in his house, when he has a wise servant who listens to his orders and does not obey them, but prefers following his own wisdom.A clever John of this kind was once sent out by his master to seek a lost cow.He stayed away a long time, and the master thought, “Faithful John does not spare any pains over his work!”As, however, he did not come back at all, the master was afraid lest some misfortune had befallen him, and set out himself to look for him.He had to search a long time, but at last he perceived the boy who was running up and down a large field.“Now, dear John,” said the master when he had got up to him, “hast thou found the cow which I sent thee to seek?”“No, master,” he answered, “I have not found the cow, but then I have not looked for it.”“Then what hast thou looked for, John?”“Something better, and that luckily I have found.”“What is that, John?”“Three blackbirds,” answered the boy.“And where are they?” asked the master.“I see one of them, I hear the other, and I am running after the third,” answered the wise boy."
"以此为例，不要为你的主人或他们的命令而劳神费力，做你想做的、高兴做的事，那样你就会和聪明的约翰表现得一样机智了。","Take example by this, do not trouble yourselves about your masters or their orders, but rather do what comes into your head and pleases you, and then you will act just as wisely as prudent John."
