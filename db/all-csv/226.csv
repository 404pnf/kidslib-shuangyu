"泰拉奇纳的旅店","The Inn at Terracina"
"作者：华盛顿·欧文　","by Washington Irving"
"驾！驾！驾！驾！驾！","Crack! crack! crack! crack! crack!"
"“那不勒斯的信差来了。” 泰拉奇纳旅店的店主说，“牵匹新马出来。”","“Here comes the estafette from Naples,” said mine host of the inn at Terracina, “bring out the relay.”"
"信差像往常一样沿路飞驰而来，在头上挥舞着一根短柄马鞭，上面系着一根多节的长绳。每挥一次，马鞭就像手枪一样发出响声。他是一个结实魁梧的青年，穿着传统的制服——一件漂亮的蓝色上衣，上面镶着饰物和金色花边。然而，衣服背面太短了，几乎遮不住腰带，而且像鹪鹩的尾巴一样往上翘。他头戴一顶镶金边的三角帽，脚蹬一双坚挺的马靴。他没有穿平时常穿的皮马裤，反而穿了一条破内裤，连屁股都遮不住，很不雅观。","The estafette came as usual galloping up the road, brandishing over his head a short-handled whip, with a long knotted lash; every smack of which made a report like a pistol.He was a tight square-set young fellow, in the customary uniform—a smart blue coat, ornamented with facings and gold lace, but so short behind as to reach scarcely below his waistband, and cocked up not unlike the tail of a wren.A cocked hat, edged with gold lace; a pair of stiff riding boots; but instead of the usual leathern breeches he had a fragment of a pair of drawers that scarcely furnished an apology for modesty to hide behind."
"信差飞奔到门口，跳下马来。","The estafette galloped up to the door and jumped from his horse."
"“一杯红葡萄酒，一匹新马，一条马裤。”他说，“快点——我已经晚点了，得马上出发！”","“A glass of rosolio, a fresh horse, and a pair of breeches,” said he, “and quickly—I am behind my time, and must be off.”"
"“圣真纳约！”店主答道，“出了什么事？你把衣服丢到哪里了？”","“San Genaro!” replied the host, “why, where hast thou left thy garment?”"
"“衣服在从丰迪来这儿的路上被强盗抢走了。”","“Among the robbers between this and Fondi.”"
"“什么！抢信差！我还从没听说过这种荒唐事。他们想从你那里抢什么东西？”","“What! rob an estafette!I never heard of such folly.What could they hope to get from thee?”"
"“我的皮马裤！”信差答道，“那马裤是崭新崭新的，像金子般闪亮，所以叫强盗头子给看上了。”","“My leather breeches!” replied the estafette.“They were brand new, and shone like gold, and hit the fancy of the captain.”"
"“唉，这些家伙越来越坏了。连信差都抢！而且就只为了一条皮马裤！”","“Well, these fellows grow worse and worse.To meddle with an estafette!And that merely for the sake of a pair of leather breeches!”"
"对店主而言，政府信差被抢似乎要比路上发生的其他任何暴行都让人震惊。的确，这么荒唐的暴行还是第一次。通常，强盗都小心行事，不去抢劫政府的东西。","The robbing of a government messenger seemed to strike the host with more astonishment than any other enormity that had taken place on the road; and indeed it was the first time so wanton an outrage had been committed; the robbers generally taking care not to meddle with any thing belonging to government."
"此时，信差已准备好了，因为他在说话时，手头的准备工作也一刻没停。马也换了，酒也喝了。","The estafette was by this time equipped; for he had not lost an instant in making his preparations while talking.The relay was ready: the rosolio tossed off."
"他抓住缰绳，踩上马镫。","He grasped the reins and the stirrup."
"“那帮强盗人多吗？”一个皮肤黝黑的英俊青年边从店里走出边问道。","“Were there many robbers in the band?” said a handsome, dark young man, stepping forward from the door of the inn."
"“和我原先见到的强盗一样可怕。”信差边说边跳上了马鞍。","“As formidable a band as ever I saw,” said the estafette, springing into the saddle."
"“他们对待旅客残忍吗？”一位年轻美丽的威尼斯女士问，她的手一直搭在那位绅士的胳膊上。","“Are they cruel to travellers?” said a beautiful young Venetian lady, who had been hanging on the gentleman’s arm."
"“他们十分残忍，夫人！”信差答道，踢马刺的时候，瞄了一眼那位女士。“酒神啊！他们用匕首刺杀男人，至于女人——”","“Cruel, signora!” echoed the estafette, giving a glance at the lady as he put spurs to his horse.“Corpo del Bacco! they stiletto all the men, and as to the women—”"
"驾！驾！驾！驾！驾！——信差的最后的几句话淹没在马鞭声中，他沿着通往庞廷沼泽的路飞奔而去。","Crack! crack! crack! crack! crack! — the last words were drowned in the smacking of the whip, and away galloped the estafette along the road to the Pontine marshes."
"“圣母啊！”那位漂亮的威尼斯女士突然叫道，“我们会怎么样？”","“Holy Virgin!” ejaculated the fair Venetian, “what will become of us!”"
"泰拉奇纳旅店正好坐落在古老的泰拉奇纳的城墙外，位于罗马领土的边境之上。这是一座懒散的意大利小镇。这里的居民看上去无精打采、漫不经心。据说，他们并不比周围的强盗好到哪里去。事实上，他们中一半人都应该和强盗有着某种往来。小镇位于一个高耸多石的大悬崖的正下方，崖顶上就是哥特人西奥多里克城堡的废墟。前方是广阔的地中海，海水没有涨落。在这个地方，所有的东西似乎都处于一种闲滞状态。港口一条船也看不到，除了偶尔可以看到一条小船独自在那里卸鳕鱼，那是为四旬斋准备的一点点供应。沿岸设有一些孤零零的岗楼，说明海边常有海盗和海盗船出没。远处一条大道蜿蜒穿过橄榄树林，路上到处都是矮矮的营房，暗示着旅客上山有危险，强盗们在此来去自如。","The inn of Terracina stands just outside of the walls of the old town of that name, on the frontiers of the Roman territory.A little, lazy, Italian town, the inhabitants of which, apparently heedless and listless, are said to be little better than the brigands which surround them, and indeed are half of them supposed to be in some way or other connected with the robbers.A vast, rocky height rises perpendicularly above it, with the ruins of the castle of Theodoric the Goth, crowning its summit; before it spreads the wide bosom of the Mediterranean, that sea without flux or reflux.There seems an idle pause in every thing about this place.The port is without a sail, excepting that once in a while a solitary felucca may be seen, disgorging its holy cargo of baccala, the meagre provision for the Quaresima or Lent.The naked watch towers, rising here and there along the coast, speak of pirates and corsairs which hover about these shores: while the low huts, as stations for soldiers, which dot the distant road, as it winds through an olive grove, intimate that in the ascent there is danger for the traveller and facility for the bandit."
"事实上，从小镇到丰迪，也就是在通往那不勒斯的大部分路上都有强盗出没。蜿蜒的路上石头很多、又很僻静，这使得强盗们从远处的山顶或是悬崖上就能发现旅客，于是他们在荒凉险要的山隘里等待旅客。","Indeed, it is between this town and Fondi that the road to Naples is mostly infested by banditti.It winds among rocky and solitary places, where the robbers are enabled to see the traveller from a distance from the brows of hills or impending precipices, and to lie in wait for him, at the lonely and difficult passes."
"就在这些强盗们胆大妄为、气焰嚣张到前所未有的时候，信差恰恰在这个节骨眼上突然出现了。他们在每个镇、村庄和旅店都插有探子以及亲信，为他们提供旅客们的行踪和身份。他们肆无忌惮地告诉各个乡镇的商人和别墅富豪们，要求其提供一定数目的钱财、衣服或者奢侈品，如敢违抗，则威胁加以报复。他们抢劫马车，把有钱有势的人绑架到山上，要求他们写信，勒索大笔赎金；对那些落入他们手中的女子，他们则施以暴行。","At the time that the estafette made this sudden appearance, almost in cuerpo, the audacity of the robbers had risen to an unparalleled height.They had their spies and emissaries in every town, village, and osteria, to give them notice of the quality and movements of travellers.They did not scruple to send messages into the country towns and villas, demanding certain sums of money, or articles of dress and luxury; with menaces of vengeance in case of refusal.They had plundered carriages; carried people of rank and fortune into the mountains and obliged them to write for heavy ransoms; and had committed outrages on females who had fallen in their power."
"警察竭力严加管束，却无济于事。与薄弱的警力相比，这些强盗人数更多、力量也更大。他们受到一些村民的支持与保护。尽管时不时会有罪犯的四肢被挂在他们犯下暴行之处的附近的树枝上，那些四肢慢慢变黑，或者把他们的头颅放在铁笼里，挂在路边的告示牌上，但这些使道路变得更加阴森，只会使游客而非其他人更加恐惧。","The police exerted its rigor in vain.The brigands were too numerous and powerful for a weak police.They were countenanced and cherished by several of the villages; and though now and then the limbs of malefactors hung blackening in the trees near which they had committed some atrocity; or their heads stuck upon posts in iron cages made some dreary part of the road still more dreary, still they seemed to strike dismay into no bosom but that of the traveller."
"刚才我说到的那位皮肤黝黑的英俊青年和那位威尼斯女士，他们乘着自己的骡车，还带着一位随行的仆人，在那天下午很早就到了。他们刚结婚，正在度蜜月，游览这些美丽的乡镇。这位年轻的女士在那不勒斯有位富裕的姑母，他们此刻正前去拜访。","The dark, handsome young man; and the Venetian lady, whom I have mentioned, had arrived early that afternoon in a private carriage, drawn by mules and attended by a single servant.They had been recently married, were spending the honeymoon in travelling through these delicious countries, and were on their way to visit a rich aunt of the young lady’s at Naples."
"这位女士年轻、温柔，也很胆小。沿途听到的故事让她心中充满了恐惧，她不仅仅是担心自己，更担心她的丈夫。虽然结婚都几乎一个月了，她依然近乎崇拜地爱着自己的丈夫。当她到达泰拉奇纳后，路上的谣言越来越多，已到了令人惊恐的地步，加上看到古老的城门左右两边挂着的铁笼中有两个龇牙咧嘴的强盗头颅，她不敢前行了。虽然她的丈夫试图使她安心，但也无济于事。","The lady was young, and tender and timid.The stories she had heard along the road had filled her with apprehension, not more for herself than for her husband; for though she had been married almost a month, she still loved him almost to idolatry.When she reached Terracina the rumors of the road had increased to an alarming magnitude; and the sight of two robbers’ skulls grinning in iron cages on each side of the old gateway of the town brought her to a pause.Her husband had tried in vain to reassure her."
"他们整个下午都逗留在旅店里，到了晚上想动身时又已太晚。信差走时说的话让她恐惧不已。","They had lingered all the afternoon at the inn, until it was too late to think of starting that evening, and the parting words of the estafette completed her affright."
"“咱们回罗马吧。”她说道，同时她挽着丈夫的胳膊，靠近他，像是在寻求保护——“我们回罗马吧，不去那不勒斯了。”","“Let us return to Rome,” said she, putting her arm within her husband’s, and drawing towards him as if for protection—“let us return to Rome and give up this visit to Naples.”"
"“那也不去看你姑母了？”丈夫说道。","“And give up the visit to your aunt, too,” said the husband."
"“不去了——姑母怎能和你的安全相比呢？”她答道，抬起头温柔地看着他的脸。","“Nay—what is my aunt in comparison with your safety,” said she, looking up tenderly in his face."
"从她的语调与神情就可以看出,她当时更多考虑的真的是丈夫的安全，而非自身的安危。由于他们刚刚结婚，又是因纯粹的真爱而结合，所以她这么想也完全是有可能的。至少她丈夫是这样认为的。的确，无论是谁，只要听到威尼斯人那甜美、悦耳的嗓音、那软绵绵的温柔话语，看到那温柔迷人的眼睛，就不会怀疑，不管她们说什么，丈夫是绝对相信的。","There was something in her tone and manner that showed she really was thinking more of her husband’s safety at that moment than of her own; and being recently married, and a match of pure affection, too, it is very possible that she was.At least her husband thought so.Indeed, any one who has heard the sweet, musical tone of a Venetian voice, and the melting tenderness of a Venetian phrase, and felt the soft witchery of a Venetian eye, would not wonder at the husband’s believing whatever they professed."
"他一只手握住臂弯里那只白皙的手，伸出手臂搂住她的纤纤细腰，把她拉到怀里疼爱地说：“至少今晚我们得在泰拉奇纳过夜了。”","He clasped the white hand that had been laid within his, put his arm round her slender waist, and drawing her fondly to his bosom—“This night at least,” said he, “we’ll pass at Terracina.”"
"驾！驾！驾！驾！驾！","Crack! crack! crack! crack! crack!"
"又一个身影出现在路上，引起了店主和旅客的注意。一辆六匹马拉着的马车从庞廷沼泽方向发怒般飞驰而来。车夫正疯狂地挥着马鞭，好像这样就会得到大笔丰厚的酬金一样。这是一辆四轮马车，后座上坐着一个仆人。马车的结构既十分精致、结实，又很简单；车上干净整齐地放着大量衣箱和日用品，后座有很多厚大衣和男士紧身衣，窗口露出一张精神、结实、生硬的脸，这立刻告诉人们，这辆车的主人是一位英国人。","Another apparition of the road attracted the attention of mine host and his guests.From the road across the Pontine marshes, a carriage drawn by half a dozen horses, came driving at a furious pace—the postillions smacking their whips like mad, as is the case when conscious of the greatness or the munificence of their fare.It was a landaulet, with a servant mounted on the dickey.The compact, highly finished, yet proudly simple construction of the carriage; the quantity of neat, well-arranged trunks and conveniences; the loads of box coats and upper benjamins on the dickey—and the fresh, burly, gruff-looking face at the window, proclaimed at once that it was the equipage of an Englishman."
"店主走到车门前，鞠躬问候，英国人说道：“换马到丰迪。”","“Fresh horses to Fondi,” said the Englishman, as the landlord came bowing to the carriage door."
"“大人不下车吃些点心吗？”","“Would not his Excellenza alight and take some refreshment?”"
"“不了——他打算到了丰迪再吃！”","“No—he did not mean to eat until he got to Fondi!”"
"“但是备马得花一段时间——”","“But the horses will be some time in getting ready—”"
"“唉——总是这样——在这个该死的国家，办什么事都拖拖拉拉的！”","“Ah.—that’s always the case—nothing but delay in this cursed country.”"
"“如果大人只是进店——”","“If his Excellenza would only walk into the house—”"
"“不，不，不！——告诉你，我不进去!——我只要换马，尽量快点。约翰！去看看马准备好没，别让我们在这里等上一两个钟头。告诉他，要是耽误了我们的时间，我就去驿站长那儿告他。”","“No, no, no!—I tell you no!—I want nothing but horses, and as quick as possible.John! see that the horses are got ready, and don’t let us be kept here an hour or two.Tell him if we’re delayed over the time, I’ll lodge a complaint with the postmaster.”"
"约翰摸摸自己的帽子，听从了主人的命令，带着英国仆人一贯默默服从的态度。他面色红润，圆脸，短头发，穿着短上衣、褐色裤子和高筒靴。和他的主人一样，他看似对周围所有的事物都露出鄙夷的神情。","John touched his hat, and set off to obey his master’s orders, with the taciturn obedience of an English servant.He was a ruddy, round-faced fellow, with hair cropped close; a short coat, drab breeches, and long gaiters; and appeared to have almost as much contempt as his master for everything around him."
"与此同时，英国人下了马车，两手插在口袋里，在旅店门前踱来踱去，并没有注意到一伙游手好闲的人正盯着他和他的马车。他是个强壮、魁梧的高个子，衣着精致整洁，戴着一顶姜饼色的旅行帽，嘴角露出不悦的神情——一半是因为还没吃饭，一半是因为前行速度太慢，每小时还不到七里。他这么着急并没有什么原因，只是英国人一向习惯急忙赶完路，或者换句俗话，就是“前进”。","In the meantime the Englishman got out of the carriage and walked up and down before the inn, with his hands in his pockets: taking no notice of the crowd of idlers who were gazing at him and his equipage.He was tall, stout, and well made; dressed with neatness and precision, wore a travelling-cap of the color of gingerbread, and had rather an unhappy expression about the corners of his mouth; partly from not having yet made his dinner, and partly from not having been able to get on at a greater rate than seven miles an hour.Not that he had any other cause for haste than an Englishman’s usual hurry to get to the end of a journey; or, to use the regular phrase, “to get on.”"
"过了一会儿，仆人从马厩回来了，摆着一张臭脸，和主人的表情如出一辙。","After some time the servant returned from the stable with as sour a look as his master."
"“马备好了吗，约翰？”","“Are the horses ready, John?”"
"“没有，大人——我还从没见过这样的地方。什么事都办不了。我觉得大人最好先进屋里吃点东西，我们到丰迪还有很长一段时间呢。”","“No, sir—I never saw such a place.There’s no getting anything done.I think your honor had better step into the house and get something to eat; it will be a long while before we get to Fundy.”"
"“这该死的旅店——这不过是个花招——我什么也不吃，就要故意刁难他们。”这个英国人说道，这么长时间不吃饭，让他的脾气变得更加暴躁了。","“D—n the house—it’s a mere trick—I’ll not eat anything, just to spite them,” said the Englishman, still more crusty at the prospect of being so long without his dinner."
"约翰说：“他们都说大人这么晚动身不好。因为前面的路上到处都是强盗。”","“They say your honor’s very wrong,” said John, “to set off at this late hour.The road’s full of highwaymen.”"
"“这纯粹是为了招揽顾客而造谣罢了。”","“Mere tales to get custom.”"
"“我们前面过去的那个信差就被一帮强盗拦住了。”约翰说道，每听到一条消息，他的语气就加重一些。","“The estafette which passed us was stopped by a whole gang,” said John, increasing his emphasis with each additional piece of information."
"“我一个字也不信。”","“I don’t believe a word of it.”"
"“他们抢了他的马裤。”约翰边说边扣紧了自己的腰带。","“They robbed him of his breeches,” said John, giving at the same time a hitch to his own waist-band."
"“全是胡扯！”","“All humbug!”"
"这时那个肤色黝黑的英俊青年走上前来，用不流利的英语彬彬有礼地和那位英国人说话，并邀请他共进即将开始的晚餐。“谢谢。”英国人说着，一面把手往口袋更深处插，一面带着怀疑的神色瞄了这个青年男子一眼，好像觉得他是因为觊觎自己的钱财才这么彬彬有礼的。","Here the dark, handsome young man stepped forward and addressing the Englishman very politely in broken English, invited him to partake of a repast he was about to make.“Thank’ee,” said the Englishman, thrusting his hands deeper into his pockets, and casting a slight side glance of suspicion at the young man, as if he thought from his civility he must have a design upon his purse."
"“如果您肯赏脸，我们会感到非常高兴。”那位女士用温柔的威尼斯方言说道。她的甜美的口音十分具有说服力。那位英国人朝她脸上瞄了一眼，她的美貌更为动人。他的表情立刻温和起来。他向她彬彬有礼地鞠了一躬。“我很愿意，夫人。”他说道。","“We shall be most happy if you will do us that favor,” said the lady, in her soft Venetian dialect.There was a sweetness in her accents that was most persuasive.The Englishman cast a look upon her countenance; her beauty was still more eloquent.His features instantly relaxed.He made an attempt at a civil bow.“With great pleasure, signora,” said he."
"总之，他原本那么急于想要“前进”，现在突然不急了；他原本打定主意忍饥挨饿直到丰迪，好惩罚这个店主，现在也放弃了。约翰为他的主人挑了店里最好的一间房，准备在这里住上一晚，明早动身。","In short, the eagerness to “get on” was suddenly slackened; the determination to famish himself as far as Fondi by way of punishing the landlord was abandoned; John chose the best apartment in the inn for his master’s reception, and preparations were made to remain there until morning."
"过夜需要的所有东西都从马车上卸下来。既有常用的箱子、写字台、公事包、梳妆盒，也有那些能够提供方便但又很累赘的东西。旅店门口那些看热闹的闲人们，裹着脏大衣，只露出一只锐利的眼睛。他们互相讨论这些行李的份量，似乎足够养活一支军队了。店里的伙计们也十分惊奇，他们谈论着那些华丽的梳妆盒，摆在梳妆台上的金银物品，以及从箱子里取出时那袋叮当作响的金子。那天晚上，整个泰拉奇纳的人都在讨论这个奇怪的“贵族的”财富和那些随身携带的珍宝。","The carriage was unpacked of such of its contents as were indispensable for the night.There was the usual parade of trunks and writing-desks, and portfolios, and dressing-boxes, and those other oppressive conveniences which burden a comfortable man.The observant loiterers about the inn door, wrapped up in great dirt-colored cloaks, with only a hawk’s eye uncovered, made many remarks to each other on this quantity of luggage that seemed enough for an army.And the domestics of the inn talked with wonder of the splendid dressing-case, with its gold and silver furniture that was spread out on the toilette table, and the bag of gold that chinked as it was taken out of the trunk.The strange “Milor’s” wealth, and the treasures he carried about him, were the talk, that evening, over all Terracina."
"这个英国人洗了一会儿澡，换上吃饭的衣服。做了这么多努力，费了这么多事之后，他终于觉得轻松自如，这才走出来。他戴着笔挺的白领结，精心打扮，穿着一尘不染的衣服。进来时，他很正式地鞠了一躬，然后才坐下来。毫无疑问，他是想表达自己的诚恳，然而这在他人看来却是一种冷漠。","The Englishman took some time to make his ablutions and arrange his dress for table, and after considerable labor and effort in putting himself at his ease, made his appearance, with stiff white cravat, his clothes free from the least speck of dust, and adjusted with precision.He made a formal bow on entering, which no doubt he meant to be cordial, but which any one else would have considered cool, and took his seat."
"所谓的意大利晚餐，或是英国人所称的正餐，已经摆上餐桌。这顿晚餐囊括了天上飞的、地上跑的、海里游的，因为空中的鸟、田野的兽、海里的鱼，应有尽有。那位英国人的仆人也热心地要为主人做牛排吃，结果把厨房弄得一团糟。他走出来的时候，端着番茄酱、酱油、辣椒粉、哈维酱以及一瓶葡萄酒。这些都是从那个仓库，也就是那个马车里取出来的，他的主人似乎想带着英国周游世界。但是，这位英国人认为每一道菜都很糟糕。碗里的汤就像一个黑海，上面浮着各种鸟兽的肝、四肢和肉块碎片，犹如失事船只的残骸一样。有一道被店主称为嫩鸡的翅膀瘦小的动物太嫩了，他无法消受，因为那只鸡显然是害肺痨死掉的。通心粉是烟熏的。牛排是用坚硬的水牛肉做的，店主的表情便可以证明这一点。什么菜都不对这英国人的胃口，除了一道炖鳗鱼的菜，他还吃得津津有味。可当有人告诉他这是用蛇肉做的时候，他差点儿把吃的都吐出来。而这种蛇捕自泰拉奇纳岩石中，被本地人视为一大美味。","The supper, as it was termed by the Italian, or dinner, as the Englishman called it, was now served.Heaven and earth, and the waters under the earth, had been moved to furnish it, for there were birds of the air and beasts of the earth and fish of the sea.The Englishman’s servant, too, had turned the kitchen topsy-turvy in his zeal to cook his master a beefsteak; and made his appearance loaded with ketchup, and soy, and Cayenne pepper, and Harvey sauce, and a bottle of port wine, from that warehouse, the carriage, in which his master seemed desirous of carrying England about the world with him.Every thing, however, according to the Englishman, was execrable.The tureen of soup was a black sea, with livers and limbs and fragments of all kinds of birds and beasts, floating like wrecks about it.A meagre winged animal, which my host called a delicate chicken, was too delicate for his stomach, for it had evidently died of a consumption.The macaroni was smoked.The beefsteak was tough buffalo’s flesh, and the countenance of mine host confirmed the assertion.Nothing seemed to hit his palate but a dish of stewed eels, of which he ate with great relish, but had nearly refunded them when told that they were vipers, caught among the rocks of Terracina, and esteemed a great delicacy."
"总之，英国人边吃边吼，边吼边吃，就像一只正在与同伴进食的猫，嘴里嚷着每一道菜都被下毒了，却依旧不要命的吃，不屑于死亡和医生。那位威尼斯女士并不习惯和这位英国旅客一同进餐，很后悔当初劝他一起吃饭，因为尽管他对自己很亲近，但对周围其他人却很不近人情，这使她有所畏惧。不过，若要平息那位英国人的脾气，莫过于吃一顿，不管烹调技艺如何；若要他与同伴们友好相处，莫过于一同进餐。所以，这个英国人在酒菜还未过半时，就觉得这个威尼斯人对一个外国人还是十分宽容的，他的太太也几乎和英国女人一样漂亮。","In short, the Englishman ate and growled, and ate and growled, like a cat eating in company, pronouncing himself poisoned by every dish, yet eating on in defiance of death and the doctor.The Venetian lady, not accustomed to English travellers, almost repented having persuaded him to the meal; for though very gracious to her, he was so crusty to all the world beside, that she stood in awe of him.There is nothing, however, that conquers John Bull’s crustiness sooner than eating, whatever may be the cookery; and nothing brings him into good humor with his company sooner than eating together; the Englishman, therefore, had not half finished his repast and his bottle, before he began to think the Venetian a very tolerable fellow for a foreigner, and his wife almost handsome enough to be an Englishwoman."
"吃饭的时候，人们谈到了强盗的故事，让这位美丽的威尼斯女士心烦意乱。店主和伙计们的强盗故事和端上来的菜肴一样多，几乎把这可怜的女人的食欲全都吓跑了。这些故事中有一个关于泰拉奇纳学校的，仍然记忆犹新。强盗们为了拿到赎金，把所有的学生都抓到山上，并残忍地杀害了一名学生，以此威胁其他学生的父母前来缴纳赎金。另一个故事说的是，一位儿子被强盗绑架的罗马绅士因为耽误了给强盗送赎金，收到一封夹有他儿子的一只耳朵的信，信上说如果不快点汇钱，他很快会收到另一只耳朵，而且他将会慢慢收到儿子的其他身体部位，直到他按价去赎为止。","In the course of the repast the tales of robbers which harassed the mind of the fair Venetian, were brought into discussion.The landlord and the waiter served up such a number of them as they served up the dishes, that they almost frightened away the poor lady’s appetite.Among these was the story of the school of Terracina, still fresh in every mind, where the students were carried up the mountains by the banditti, in hopes of ransom, and one of them massacred, to bring the parents to terms for the others.There was a story also of a gentleman of Rome, who delayed remitting the ransom demanded for his son, detained by the banditti, and received one of his son’s ears in a letter with information that the other would be remitted to him soon, if the money were not forthcoming, and that in this way he would receive the boy by instalments until he came to terms."
"那位美丽的威尼斯女士听到了这些故事吓得直打哆嗦。看到大家对故事有了反应，店主像一个讲故事的高手，描述得更加恐怖。就在他正要说到一位英国大贵族和其家庭的不幸时，那位英国人厌烦了他的喋喋不休，不耐烦地打断了他，说这些只不过是旅客道听途说，又或是那些无知的乡下人和店主在夸大其词。店主见英国人不相信他讲的故事，还讥讽他们这一行，感到非常气愤，于是就讲了另外六个更加恐怖的故事来证实自己所说的话。","The fair Venetian shuddered as she heard these tales.The landlord, like a true story-teller, doubled the dose when he saw how it operated.He was just proceeding to relate the misfortunes of a great English lord and his family, when the Englishman, tired of his volubility, testily interrupted him, and pronounced these accounts mere traveller’s tales, or the exaggerations of peasants and innkeepers.The landlord was indignant at the doubt levelled at his stories, and the innuendo levelled at his cloth; he cited half a dozen stories still more terrible, to corroborate those he had already told."
"“我一个字也不相信。”英国人说。","“I don’t believe a word of them,” said the Englishman."
"“但确实有几个强盗被审讯并处死了。”","“But the robbers had been tried and executed.”"
"“全都是闹剧！”","“All a farce!”"
"“可他们的头还挂在路边呢。”","“But their heads were stuck up along the road.”"
"“那是一百年来积攒的旧人头。”","“Old skulls accumulated during a century.”"
"店主边走出门边喃喃自语：“圣真纳约！这些英国人真奇怪。”","The landlord muttered to himself as he went out at the door, “San Genaro, come sono singolari questi Inglesi.”"
"旅店门外又开始嘈杂起来，又来了更多旅客。各种各样的喧嚣声不绝于耳，有“咔哒咔哒”的马蹄声，也有“咔嚓咔嚓”的车轮声，门里门外，吵吵闹闹，看来这次来的人真是不少。事实上，来的是商队和他们的护送队——一些定期运送货物的商人，他们请了一支军队保护他们以防盗匪。旅客们充分利用商队的优势，所以商队后面通常跟着一长串车辆。过了好一会儿，店主跟伙计们才回来。他们刚才急着去迎接这批突然新来的大部队了。店主回来的时候，脸上带着胜利的微笑。——“或许，”他一边收拾桌子一边说道，“或许大人还不知道发生了什么事情。”","A fresh hubbub outside of the inn announced the arrival of more travellers; and from the variety of voices, or rather clamors, the clattering of horses’ hoofs, the rattling of wheels, and the general uproar both within and without, the arrival seemed to be numerous.It was, in fact, the procaccio, and its convoy—a kind of caravan of merchandise, that sets out on stated days, under an escort of soldiery to protect it from the robbers.Travellers avail themselves of the occasion, and many carriages accompany the procaccio.It was a long time before either landlord or waiter returned, being hurried away by the tempest of new custom.When mine host appeared, there was a smile of triumph on his countenance. —“Perhaps,” said he, as he cleared away the table, “perhaps the signor has not heard of what has happened.”"
"“怎么了？”英国人冷冷地问道。","“What?” said the Englishman, drily."
"“哦，先生，商队刚到，还带来消息说是强盗又在抢劫了。”","“Oh, the procaccio has arrived, and has brought accounts of fresh exploits of the robbers, signor.”"
"“呸！”","“Pish!”"
"“他们还说了很多关于一个英国贵族和他家人的消息。”店主强调道。","“There’s more news of the English Milor and his family,” said the host, emphatically."
"“一个英国贵族？——哪个英国贵族？”","“An English lord.—What English lord?”"
"“波普金大人。”","“Milor Popkin.”"
"“波普金爵士？我从没听说过有这个人！”","“Lord Popkin?I never heard of such a title!”"
"“啊，千真万确——他是一位英国大贵族，最近带着他的夫人小姐路过此地——是个大人物——是伦敦市的高级议员——阿尔曼诺。”","“O Sicuro—a great nobleman that passed through here lately with his Milady and daughters—a magnifico—one of the grand councillors of London—un almanno.”"
"“阿尔曼诺——阿尔曼诺？——他是说市议员。”","“Almanno—almanno?—tut! he means alderman.”"
"“是的，市议员波普金大人、波普金夫人和小姐！”店主得意洋洋地说。他现在正打算详细地叙述一番，但是却被英国人阻止了，英国人似乎打定主意不相信他的话，也不容他说下去。然而，意大利人的话匣是不容易打住的：我们的店主一面把残羹剩饭端出房间，一面滔滔不绝地越来越起劲。虽然当他从过道出去，声音也渐行渐远了，但是“波普金——波普金——波普金——波普——波普——波普——”最后几个他最钟爱的词仍然清晰可辨。","“Sicuro, aldermanno Popkin, and the principezza Popkin, and the signorina Popkin!” said mine host, triumphantly.He would now have entered into a full detail, but was thwarted by the Englishman, who seemed determined not to credit or indulge him in his stories.An Italian tongue, however, is not easily checked: that of mine host continued to run on with increasing volubility as he conveyed the fragments of the repast out of the room, and the last that could be distinguished of his voice, as it died away along the corridor, was the constant recurrence of the favorite word Popkin—Popkin—Popkin—pop—pop—pop."
"的确，商队的到来，使屋子里到处都是客人，同时也带来了各种故事。晚饭后，那位英国人和他的同伴们来到了一间大厅，一间穿过旅店中心的普通房间。房子很暗，看起来很脏，到处都摆着桌子。一些旅客成堆坐着，而另外一些旅客则在漫步，他们饥肠辘辘，正焦急地等着吃晚饭。这个商队由众多旅行者构成，他们来自各国各个阶层，乘着各式各样的车辆而来。尽管这些旅客是一批一批的，但在同一支队伍的护送下，他们一路上都混熟了。他们人数众多且有强大的护送队的护送，防止了强盗们的任何侵犯。此外，每个车队都有自己的奇谈，彼此之间在讲故事上开始较量。不止一人说看见过成群的强盗从岩石上窥探；亦或说看见他们的枪在灌木丛中闪现；或是发现一些看似可疑的人怒视着他们，可是他们一看见护送队就消失了。","The arrival of the procaccio had indeed filled the house with stories as it had with guests.The Englishman and his companions walked out after supper into the great hall, or common room of the inn, which runs through the centre building; a gloomy, dirty-looking apartment, with tables placed in various parts of it, at which some of the travellers were seated in groups, while others strolled about in famished impatience for their evening’s meal.As the procaccio was a kind of caravan of travellers, there were people of every class and country, who had come in all kinds of vehicles; and though they kept in some measure in separate parties, yet the being united under one common escort had jumbled them into companionship on the road.Their formidable number and the formidable guard that accompanied them, had prevented any molestation from the banditti; but every carriage had its tale of wonder, and one vied with another in the recital.Not one but had seen groups of robbers peering over the rocks; or their guns peeping out from among the bushes, or had been reconnoitred by some suspicious-looking fellow with scowling eye, who disappeared on seeing the guard."
"那位美丽的威尼斯女士带着强烈的好奇心听完全部的故事，正如我们常常以此来满足自己渴求恐怖的感觉一样。即使那个英国人也开始对这个话题感兴趣了，想从这里得到比流言更加准确的信息。","The fair Venetian listened to all these stories with that eager curiosity with which we seek to pamper any feeling of alarm.Even the Englishman began to feel interested in the subject, and desirous of gaining more correct information than these mere flying reports."
"他混到一伙看起来最体面的人群中，这伙人都围着那个正在讲故事人，又瘦又高，长着长长的鹰钩鼻、高高的额头和一双闪闪发光的凸起的眼睛，很引人注目，头上还戴着一顶镶嵌着金流苏的绿丝绒旅行帽。他滔滔不绝，语言流利，既善于演讲又喜欢展示自己的才能。他是个罗马人，是个外科医生，但也偶尔写写诗，搞一些即兴创作。他很快就给这个英国人提供了大量关于强盗的信息。","He mingled in one of the groups which appeared to be the most respectable, and which was assembled round a tall, thin person, with long Roman nose, a high forehead, and lively prominent eye, beaming from under a green velvet travelling-cap with gold tassel.He was holding forth with all the fluency of a man who talks well and likes to exert his talent.He was of Rome; a surgeon by profession, a poet by choice, and one who was something of an improvvisatore.He soon gave the Englishman abundance of information respecting the banditti."
"“事实上，”他说，“山里很多村子的村民都是强盗，或者更确切地说，他们能为强盗提供极好的庇护所。强盗们占据了大量贫穷荒凉的村庄，这些村庄位于横跨多国边境的亚平宁山脉上。他们熟悉所有险要的山隘、捷径以及据点。他们保护这些地区里那些善良的穷人和温和的居民，不去骚扰他们，还常常帮他们致富。的确，在山里的村庄和他们分赃的边境城镇的居民看来，他们是非法英雄。他们从山顶眺望平原和山谷，并考虑他们的将来。”","“The fact is,” said he, “that many of the people in the villages among the mountains are robbers, or rather the robbers find perfect asylum among them.They range over a vast extent of wild impracticable country, along the chain of Apennines, bordering on different states; they know all the difficult passes, the short cuts and strong-holds.They are secure of the good-will of the poor and peaceful inhabitants of those regions, whom they never disturb, and whom they often enrich.Indeed, they are looked upon as a sort of illegitimate heroes among the mountain villages, and some of the frontier towns, where they dispose of their plunder.From these mountains they keep a look-out upon the plains and valleys, and meditate their descents.”"
"“去丰迪的路，也就是你要走的那条路，是一个出名地强盗们经常光顾的地方。从远处那些地理位置高的小村庄就可以看到路上的状况。因此，强盗们就像呆在自己巢中的老鹰一样，观察着旅客，看从哪些人身上可以得到赃物或勒索赎金。蜿蜒的马路使他们能够提前看到即将路过的马车，这样他们就有足够的时间到达有利的伏击地，在那里捕获他们的猎物。”","“The road to Fondi, which you are about to travel, is one of the places most noted for their exploits.It is overlooked from some distance by little hamlets, perched upon heights.From hence, the brigands, like hawks in their nests, keep on the watch for such travellers as are likely to afford either booty or ransom.The windings of the road enable them to see carriages long before they pass, so that they have time to get to some advantageous lurking-place from whence to pounce upon their prey.”"
"“可是为什么警察不出面干预，剿灭他们呢？”英国人问道。","“But why does not the police interfere and root them out?” said the Englishman."
"“因为警察太弱，而强盗太强了。”那人回答道，“要剿灭他们比你想象的要难得多。他们一般都跟村里的人以及农民都联系密切，彼此都认识。为数众多的匪徒之间不但彼此照应，还跟全国各地各种各样的人有联系。他们知道一切将要发生的事情。警察一有举动，他们就会知道。他们的间谍和探子无处不在。这些人潜藏在镇里、乡村、旅馆里，混迹于每一伙人群中，遍布于每一个旅游点。如果这时候有人正在监视我们，我一点儿也不会感到惊讶。”他说。","“The police is too weak and the banditti are too strong,” replied the improvvisatore.“To root them out would be a more difficult task than you imagine.They are connected and identified with the people of the villages and the peasantry generally; the numerous bands have an understanding with each other, and with people of various conditions in all parts of the country.They know all that is going on; a gens d’armes cannot stir without their being aware of it.They have their spies and emissaries in every direction; they lurk about towns, villages, inns,—mingle in every crowd, pervade every place of resort.I should not be surprised,” said he, “if some one should be supervising us at this moment.”"
"那位美丽的威尼斯女士惊恐地环顾四周，脸色都变白了。","The fair Venetian looked round fearfully and turned pale."
"“意大利强盗有一个怪癖，”那人接着讲道，“他们穿着一种能表明职业的服装，更确切的说是一种制服。这大概是想祛除他们偷偷摸摸、非法营生的品性，并让普通人觉得他们有些军人气质，或者，也许想以此来抓住村里年轻人的眼球，诱使他们入伙。他们的服装往往华丽而又花哨。他们有些人穿着带有华丽刺绣的鲜亮的夹克和马裤，腰系宽宽的布腰带，或是丝绸网状的腰带，头顶宽边的、带有羽毛或是彩色飘带装饰的帽子，头发用丝网拢着。”","“One peculiarity of the Italian banditti” continued the improvvisatore, “is that they wear a kind of uniform, or rather costume, which designates their profession.This is probably done to take away from its skulking lawless character, and to give it something of a military air in the eyes of the common people; or perhaps to catch by outward dash and show the fancies of the young men of the villages.These dresses or costumes are often rich and fanciful.Some wear jackets and breeches of bright colors, richly embroidered; broad belts of cloth; or sashes of silk net; broad, high-crowned hats, decorated with feathers of variously-colored ribbands, and silk nets for the hair."
"“有很多强盗都是农民。他们每年有一部分时间在村里从事普通职业，然后剩下的时间都在大山里度过。有些人好像每年只有一个季度当强盗，剩下的时间里，他们的穿着和习惯都跟普通人一样。村里很多年轻人偶尔也尝试下这种强盗生活，仅仅是因为爱冒险，出于年轻时那种野性流浪的精神，以及受到身边的坏榜样不良影响。但又一点可以肯定的是，这些年轻人都不喜欢一直过着一成不变的生活。他们喜欢无拘无束的自由和原始的放纵。深山里的生活充满了危险和刺激——掠夺富有的旅客对他们来说很很有诱惑力，可以满足贪婪。”","“Many of the robbers are peasants who follow ordinary occupations in the villages for a part of the year, and take to the mountains for the rest.Some only go out for a season, as it were, on a hunting expedition, and then resume the dress and habits of common life.Many of the young men of the villages take to this kind of life occasionally from a mere love of adventure, the wild wandering spirit of youth and the contagion of bad example; but it is remarked that they can never after brook a long continuance in settled life.They get fond of the unbounded freedom and rude license they enjoy; and there is something in this wild mountain life checquered by adventure and peril, that is wonderfully fascinating, independent of the gratification of cupidity by the plunder of the wealthy traveller.”"
"这时，一位活跃的那不勒斯律师打断了这位滔滔不绝的人。他说：“你提到的那些年轻的强盗让我想起了一个有学识的医生的奇遇。他是我的朋友，而那件事就发生在这附近。”","Here the improvvisatore was interrupted by a lively Neapolitan lawyer.“Your mention of the younger robbers,” said he, “puts me in mind of an adventure of a learned doctor, a friend of mine, which happened in this very neighborhood.”"
"大家当然都希望听听那位医生的奇遇，只有那位口若悬河的人例外。因为他爱说，而且爱听自己说，还有，他更习惯于无间断地长篇演说。此时，他显得非常生气，因为他正说在兴头上的时候被打断了。","A wish was of course expressed to hear the adventure of the doctor by all except the improvvisatore, who, being fond of talking and of hearing himself talk, and accustomed moreover to harangue without interruption, looked rather annoyed at being checked when in full career."
"然而，那位那不勒斯人并没有注意到他的不悦，讲了下面这段轶事。","The Neapolitan, however, took no notice of his chagrin, but related the following anecdote."
