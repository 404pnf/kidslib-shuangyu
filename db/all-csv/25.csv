"第一章","CHAPTER I"
"一日，我在翻阅文件时发现了一年前我写给一位昔日同窗的一封信的抄件：","The other day, in looking over my papers, I found in my copy of a letter, sent by me a year since to an old school acquaintance:—"
"亲爱的查尔斯，我觉得我们在伊顿读书那会儿，都称不上是广受欢迎的人物。你是个言辞刻薄、观察力敏锐、精明又不近人情的家伙。我自己的形象我就不试图去描绘了，但我也回想不起来那时的我有什么特别讨人喜欢之处。你能想起来吗？我不清楚是什么样的动物间的吸引力将你我吸引到了一起；但我对你绝对没有产生过像皮拉得斯和俄瑞斯忒斯之间的那种感情；而对你来说，我有理由相信你也同样没有对我产生任何浪漫情绪。但是，课外时间我们还是时常一起散步，一起交谈。当我们谈到同学和老师时，我们能相互理解；当我再谈到某种情感的话题、某种对极好或美丽事物的模糊的爱意时，无论这事物是有生命的还是无生命的，你无情的冷嘲热讽并不能使我动摇。我当时就觉得你的指责不能改变我的行为，现在仍是这样。","Dear Charles,—I think when you and I were at Eton together, we were neither of us what could be called popular characters.You were a sarcastic, observant, shrewd, cold-blooded creature.My own portrait I will not attempt to draw, but I cannot recollect that it was a strikingly attractive one; can you?What animal magnetism drew thee and me together I know not; certainly I never experienced anything of the Pylades and Orestes sentiment for you, and I have reason to believe that you, on your part, were equally free from all romantic regard to me. Still, out of school hours, we walked and talked continually together.When the theme of conversation was our companions or our masters, we understood each other, and when I recurred to some sentiment of affection, some vague love of an excellent or beautiful object, whether in animate or inanimate nature, your sardonic coldness did not move me. I felt myself superior to that check then as I do now."
"很久没有给你写信了，也更久没有见到你了。某日偶然翻阅你们郡的报纸，我一眼就看到了你的名字。我便想起了昔日的时光，想起了自我们分别后发生的种种事情，于是，我便坐下开始写这封信。我不晓得你近来在做些什么，但是如果你想听，我可以给你讲讲我经历了怎样的世事沧桑。","It is a long time since I wrote to you, and a still longer time since I saw you.Chancing to take up a newspaper of your county the other day, my eye fell upon your name.I began to think of old times, to run over the events which have transpired since we separated, and I sat down and commenced this letter.What you have been doing I know not; but you shall hear, if you choose to listen, how the world has wagged with me."
"首先，离开伊顿后，我和我舅父们，即泰尼德尔勋爵和约翰·西科姆议员，见了一面。","First, after leaving Eton, I had an interview with my maternal uncles, Lord Tynedale and the Hon. John Seacombe."
"他们问我是否愿意进入教会，我的贵族舅父提出，如果我愿意，他可以利用自己的职权为我提供在西科姆的一切生活费用；西科姆先生则暗示我说，当我当上西科姆－卡姆－斯凯夫教区的教区长后，我或许可以从六位表姐妹——即他的六个女儿——中娶到一位，让她当我的妻子和教区的女主人，可是我极其讨厌他的女儿们。","They asked me if I would enter the Church, and my uncle the nobleman offered me the living of Seacombe, which is in his gift, if I would; then my other uncle, Mr. Seacombe, hinted that when I became rector of Seacombe-cum-Scaife, I might perhaps be allowed to take, as mistress of my house and head of my parish, one of my six cousins, his daughters, all of whom I greatly dislike."
"教会的职务及许婚的好意我都拒绝了。当个好牧师固然是件好事，但我肯定不是这块料。至于妻子——啊，一想到要和其中一位表姐或表妹共度一生，我就像做了一场噩梦！毫无疑问，她们颇有才学，也很貌美，但是她们的才学和美貌一点都不能拨动我的心弦。想起冬天的夜晚要在西科姆教区的客厅壁炉边只和其中一位表姐妹——比如，那位身材魁梧、犹如雕塑般的萨拉——一起度过。不！这种情况下，我肯定当不了好丈夫，也当不了好牧师。","I declined both the Church and matrimony.A good clergyman is a good thing, but I should have made a very bad one.As to the wife—oh, how like a nightmare is the thought of being bound for life to one of my cousins!No doubt they are accomplished and pretty; but not an accomplishment, not a charm of theirs, touches a chord in my bosom.To think of passing the winter evenings by the parlour fireside of Seacombe Rectory alone with one of them—for instance, the large and well-modelled statue, Sarah—no. I should be a bad husband, under such circumstances, as well as a bad clergyman."
"我拒绝舅父们的好意时，他们问我准备做什么。我说我会好好想想。他们提醒我说，我既没有财产也没有什么遗产可以指望。好长一阵沉默之后，泰尼德尔勋爵严厉地问我是否打算步父亲的后尘去经商。当时，我并没有那种想法。我觉得我脑袋不够机灵，没有资格成为一名好商人。我的爱好和志向也不在于此；可当泰尼德尔勋爵说到“经商”两个字时，那轻蔑的表情和那鄙视挖苦的语气让我即刻下定了决心。父亲对我来说只不过是个名字罢了，即便如此，我也不喜欢别人在我的面前用讥笑的口吻提起他。于是，我急忙激动地回答说：“我只能步父亲后尘了。是的，我要成为一名商人。”舅父们没有反对。我们就这样怀着对彼此的厌恶分别了。想起这次会面，我觉得摆脱泰尼德尔监护的烦扰是相当正确的；但我同时又很愚蠢，这么快又给自己的肩上加了另一个重担——有可能比以往的重负更无法忍受，当然以前也从没有试过。","When I had declined my uncles’ offers, they asked me what I intended to do.I said I should reflect.They reminded me that I had no fortune, and no expectation of any, and after a considerable pause Lord Tynedale demanded sternly whether I had thoughts of following my father’s steps and engaging in trade.Now, I had had no thoughts of the sort.I do not think that my turn of mind qualifies me to make a good tradesman.My taste, my ambition does not lie in that way; but such was the scorn expressed in Lord Tynedale’s countenance as he pronounced the word trade, such the contemptuous sarcasm of his tone, that I was instantly decided.My father was but a name to me, yet that name I did not like to hear mentioned with a sneer to my very face.I answered then, with haste and warmth, “I cannot do better than follow in my father’s steps; yes, I will be a tradesman.” My uncles did not remonstrate.They and I parted with mutual disgust.In reviewing this transaction, I find that I was quite right to shake off the burden of Tynedale’s patronage, but a fool to offer my shoulders instantly for the reception of another burden—one which might be more intolerable, and which certainly was yet untried."
"我即刻写信给爱德华——你知道爱德华的，他是我唯一的兄弟，比我年长十岁，娶了一位富有的磨坊主的女儿，现在是这家磨坊厂厂主，还经营着我父亲破产前的生意。你知道我父亲——曾经也被人认为是个大富翁——破产后不久便离开人世了，我母亲在父亲过世后穷困潦倒地生活了六个多月，她的贵族兄弟们对她见死不救，因为她嫁给郡里的制造商克利姆斯沃思而大大得罪了他们。第六个月月底，母亲生下我之后便离开了人世，我想，她并没有太多遗憾，因为这个世界没有给她多少希望和籍慰。","I wrote instantly to Edward—you know Edward, my only brother, ten years my senior, married to a rich mill-owner’s daughter, and now possessor of the mill and business which was my father’s before he failed.You are aware that my father—once reckoned a Croesus of wealth—became bankrupt a short time previous to his death, and that my mother lived in destitution for some six months after him, unhelped by her aristocratical brothers, whom she had mortally offended by her union with Crimsworth, the —shire manufacturer.At the end of the six months she brought me into the world, and then herself left it, without, I should think much regret, as it contained little hope or comfort for her."
"父亲的亲戚们收养了爱德华和我，直到我九岁。当时，碰巧我们郡的一个重要选区的代表职位出现了空缺。西科姆先生当了候选人。克利姆斯沃思叔父是位精明的商人，他趁此机会给候选人写了一封言辞激烈的信。信上说，如果西科姆和泰尼德尔勋爵不同意做点什么来抚养他们妹妹的遗孤，他就把这两个人对妹妹的无情和恶行公布于众，并将不遗余力破坏西科姆先生的选举。西科姆先生和泰尼德尔勋爵深知克利姆斯沃思家族的人做事向来无所忌惮，言出必行。他们也同样清楚克利姆斯沃思家族在X选区的影响力；于是，出于无奈，他们装作好心，同意支付我的教育费用。于是，我被送到了伊顿，呆了十年。在此期间，我从未与爱德华见面。爱德华长大后去经商了，他靠勤奋和能力经营着事业，如今已有所成就，在三十岁之际，他很快就发财致富了。我从他每年寄来的三四封短信中知道这些情况，他在信尾总说一些坚决仇视西科姆家族的话，并责怪我，用他的原话就是，靠他们家的施舍度日。起初，当我还小的时候，我不明白，既然我父母已经不在人世了，为什么我的学费不能仰仗泰尼德尔和西科姆舅父的帮助？但是当我长大后，我听说了他们和我父亲之间的积怨有多深，直至父亲死的时候，仇恨也未能化解；还有母亲生前遭受的一切，总之一切关于我们家的种种经历，直到那时，我才感受到寄人篱下的难堪，决心不再从这些曾经对我母亲见死不救的人那里接受任何恩惠。正是受到这些情绪的影响，我谢绝了西科姆教区的职务及与其中一位贵族表姐妹的联姻。","My father’s relations took charge of Edward, as they did of me, till I was nine years old. At that period it chanced that the representation of an important borough in our county fell vacant.Mr. Seacombe stood for it.My uncle Crimsworth, an astute mercantile man, took the opportunity of writing a fierce letter to the candidate, stating that if he and Lord Tynedale did not consent to do something towards the support of their sister’s orphan children, he would expose their relentless and malignant conduct towards that sister, and do his best to turn the circumstances against Mr. Seacombe’s election.That gentleman and Lord T. knew well enough that the Crimsworths were an unscrupulous and determined race.They knew also that they had influence in the borough of X—; and, making a virtue of necessity, they consented to defray the expenses of my education.I was sent to Eton, where I remained ten years, during which space of time Edward and I never met. He, when he grew up, entered into trade, and pursued his calling with such diligence, ability, and success, that now, in his thirtieth year, he was fast making a fortune.Of this I was apprised by the occasional short letters I received from him, some three or four times a year; which said letters never concluded without some expression of determined enmity against the house of Seacombe, and some reproach to me for living, as he said, on the bounty of that house.At first, while still in boyhood, I could not understand why, as I had no parents, I should not be indebted to my uncles Tynedale and Seacombe for my education; but as I grew up, and heard by degrees of the persevering hostility, the hatred till death evinced by them against my father, of the sufferings of my mother, of all the wrongs, in short, of our house, then did I conceive shame of the dependence in which I lived, and form a resolution no more to take bread from hands which had refused to minister to the necessities of my dying mother.It was by these feelings I was influenced when I refused the rectory of Seacombe and the union with one of my patrician cousins."
"就这样，我和舅父们之间的关系已决裂到无法挽回的程度。我写信告诉爱德华所发生的一切，并告诉他我打算追随他的脚步，成为一名商人。此外，我还问他是否可以聘我做事。他的回信对我的行为未曾表示赞许，但是他说，如果我愿意，我可以到X郡，他会“看看能否帮我找一份工作”。我强忍了信上说的一切，甚至忍下他对我智商的贬低，收拾好箱子和手提包，就动身直奔北方了。","An irreparable breach thus being effected between my uncles and myself, I wrote to Edward, told him what had occurred, and informed him of my intention to follow his steps and be a tradesman.I asked, moreover, if he could give me employment.His answer expressed no approbation of my conduct, but he said I might come down to shire if I liked, and he would “see what could be done in the way of furnishing me with work.” I repressed all, even mental comment on his note, packed my trunk and carpet-bag, and started for the north directly."
"经过两天的奔波（当时没有铁路），我终于在十月的一个雨天的下午到了X郡上。我一直以为爱德华就住在这个镇上，但是经过询问后发现只有克利姆斯沃思先生的工厂及仓库坐落在那烟雾弥漫的比格本大院，他的住所在郊外，离这里有四英里远。","After two days’ travelling (railroads were not then in existence) I arrived, one wet October afternoon, in the town of X—.I had always understood that Edward lived in this town, but on inquiry I found that it was only Mr. Crimsworth’s mill and warehouse which were situated in the smoky atmosphere of Bigben Close; his residence lay four miles out, in the country."
"当我照别人指引来到哥哥的住所时已是入暮时分了。当我往林阴道上走时，透过夕阳的余辉和阴沉的雾色，看到哥哥的房子很大，四周的场院很开阔。我在前面的草坪停了一会儿，背靠在中央的一棵大树上，饶有兴致地欣赏起克利姆斯沃思公馆的外景。","It was late in the evening when I alighted at the gates of the habitation designated to me as my brother’s.As I advanced up the avenue, I could see through the shades of twilight, and the dark gloomy mists which deepened those shades, that the house was large, and the grounds surrounding it sufficiently spacious.I paused a moment on the lawns in front, and leaning my back against a tall tree which rose in the centre, I gazed with interest on the exterior of Crimsworth Hall."
"“爱德华很富有，”我心里想，“我知道他事业做得不错，但我没想到他拥有这么一大栋宅子。”我止住惊叹，止住推测和臆想，走到门前，按了门铃。一位仆人打开门。我告诉他我是谁。他帮我脱下淋湿的斗篷，接过手提包，把我带到一个布置得像书房的房间里，屋内炉火很旺，桌上烛火通明。他告诉我他家主人还未从X镇市场上回来，但是他肯定在半小时内就能到家。","“Edward is rich,” thought I to myself “I believed him to be doing well, but I did not know he was master of a mansion like this.” Cutting short all marvelling speculation, conjecture, etc., I advanced to the front door and rang.A manservant opened it. I announced myself.He relieved me of my wet cloak and carpet-bag, and ushered me into a room furnished as a library, where there was a bright fire and candles burning on the table.He informed me that his master was not yet returned from X market, but that he would certainly be at home in the course of half an hour."
"房间里只剩我一人了，我坐在炉边包着红色山羊皮的软软的安乐椅上，望着火焰从炽热的煤里喷出，煤渣间或掉到炉边，满脑猜想着即将到来的会面场景。在众多猜疑中，唯有一点差不多可以肯定——我绝不会太失望，因为我本不抱太大的期望。我对兄弟间的情谊也并没期望太多。爱德华以往的来信早已打消了我此类的幻想。虽然如此，当我坐在那里等他回来时，我仍然很期待——迫不及待。不知道我为什么这样。我从未与这位同胞兄弟握过手，我握紧拳头，压制住心中的激动与焦躁，要不然我的手一定会抖个不停。","Being left to myself, I took the stuffed easy-chair, covered with red morocco, which stood by the fireside, and while my eyes watched the flames dart from the glowing coals, and the cinders fall at intervals on the hearth, my mind busied itself in conjectures concerning the meeting about to take place.Amidst much that was doubtful in the subject of these conjectures, there was one thing tolerably certain—I was in no danger of encountering severe disappointment; from this the moderation of my expectations guaranteed me. I anticipated no overflowings of fraternal tenderness.Edward’s letters had always been such as to prevent the engendering or harbouring of delusions of this sort.Still, as I sat awaiting his arrival, I felt eager—very eager.I cannot tell you why. My hand, so utterly a stranger to the grasp of a kindred hand, clenched itself to repress the tremor with which impatience would fain have shaken it."
"我想到了舅父们，以及从他们那里时常遭受到的冷漠和轻视，正在猜想爱德华是否会和他们一样冷漠时，听到林阴道上的门开了。车轮声渐渐靠近，克利姆斯沃思先生回来了；他和仆人简短谈话后过了几分钟，他拖着脚步靠近书房门口。光听这脚步声就知道他是房子的主人。","I thought of my uncles; and as I was engaged in wondering whether Edward’s indifference would equal the cold disdain I had always experienced from them, I heard the avenue gates open.Wheels approached the house—Mr. Crimsworth was arrived; and after the lapse of some minutes, and a brief dialogue between himself and his servant in the hall, his tread drew near the library door.That tread alone announced the master of the house."
"我对爱德华的模糊印象仍然停留在十年前——一个瘦高结实、甚是粗犷的青年；现在，当我从椅子上站起来朝书房门口走去时，我看到的是一位俊美强壮的男子，皮肤白皙，身材均匀，有着运动健将的体格。一眼看得出他是个机敏果决的人，这从他的行为举止、眼神、及整体面部表情上可以体现出来。他简单地同我攀谈了几句，在和我握手的同时从头到脚审视了我一番。他坐在羊皮安乐椅上，让我坐到另一张椅子上。","I still retained some confused recollection of Edward as he was ten years ago—a tall, wiry, raw youth; now, as I rose from my seat and turned towards the library door, I saw a fine-looking and powerful man, light-complexioned, well-made, and of athletic proportions.The first glance made me aware of an air of promptitude and sharpness, shown as well in his movements as in his port, his eye, and the general expression of his face.He greeted me with brevity, and, in the moment of shaking hands, scanned me from head to foot.He took his seat in the morocco-covered arm-chair, and motioned me to another seat."
"他说：“我以为你会到大院的账房找我。”我注意到了他说话时生硬的口气，或许他习惯这样了吧。他说话时带有喉音很重的北方口音，对于已经习惯南方清脆口音的我来说听起来十分刺耳。","“I expected you would have called at the counting-house in the Close,” said he; and his voice, I noticed, had an abrupt accent, probably habitual to him. He spoke also with a guttural northern tone, which sounded harsh in my ears, accustomed to the silvery utterance of the south."
"“马车停靠的旅馆老板告诉我你的住所。”我回答说，“起初，我怀疑他提供的信息准确度，我没想到你有这么像样的房子。”","“The landlord of the inn where the coach stopped directed me here,” said I.“I doubted at first the accuracy of his information, not being aware that you had such a residence as this.”"
"“哦，没关系！”他回答道，“我只是因为等你晚回来了半小时；没什么。我以为你肯定是搭八点钟的马车来。”","“Oh, it is all right!” he replied, “only I was kept half an hour behind time, waiting for you; that is all.I thought you must be coming by the eight o’clock coach.”"
"我对他的等待表示了歉意。他没有回答，倒是拨弄起炉里的火来，好像要掩饰不耐烦的举止；接着，他又打量了我一番。","I expressed regret that he had had to wait.He made no answer, but stirred the fire, as if to cover a movement of impatience; then he scanned me again."
"我心里暗自感到满意，在这次会面的开始我没有流露出任何热情和亲切，而是平静而镇定地问候着他。","I felt an inward satisfaction that I had not, in the first moment of meeting, betrayed any warmth, any enthusiasm, that I had saluted this man with a quiet and steady phlegm."
"“你已经和泰尼德尔和西科姆彻底决裂了？”他迫不及待地问我。","“Have you quite broken with Tynedale and Seacombe?” he asked hastily."
"“我想我不会再和他们来往了。我拒绝了他们的建议，我想，这将成为以后所有交往的障碍了。”","“I do not think I shall have any further communication with them.My refusal of their proposals will, I fancy, operate as a barrier against all future intercourse.”"
"“这样啊，”他说道，“我最好把丑话先说在前头了，‘一人不事二主’。你要是和泰尼德尔勋爵往来就别指望我帮你。”他说完这些话时，用莫名的恐吓的目光盯着我看。","“Why,” said he, “I may as well remind you at the very outset of our connection that ‘no man can serve two masters.’ Acquaintance with Lord Tynedale will be incompatible with assistance from me.” There was a kind of gratuitous menace in his eye as he looked at me in finishing this observation."
"我不想回答他的话，心里暗自推想着人的大脑构造的区别，以此为乐。不知道克利姆斯沃思先生从我的沉默中推断出了什么——也许是桀骜的征兆，或是他相信我被他的专横举止吓住了。他冷冷地盯了我好一会儿之后，一下子站了起来。","Feeling no disposition to reply to him, I contented myself with an inward speculation on the differences which exist in the constitution of men’s minds.I do not know what inference Mr. Crimsworth drew from my silence—whether he considered it a symptom of contumacity, or an evidence of my being cowed by his peremptory manner.After a long and hard stare at me, he rose sharply from his seat."
"“明天，”他说，“我有几点需要你注意；现在已经是晚饭时间了，克利斯沃思太太也许正等着呢。你来吗？”","“To-morrow,” said he, “I shall call your attention to some other points; but now it is supper-time, and Mrs. Crimsworth is probably waiting.Will you come?”"
"他大步走出房间，我紧随其后。穿过大厅时，我在想克利姆斯沃思太太会是什么样子的。我心里想，“她像泰尼德尔、西科姆和西科姆女儿们，以及这位大摇大摆走在我前面亲爱的哥哥那样与我的所好大相径庭呢，还是要比这些人好？我能和她自由自在地交谈，展现自己的真性情吗？还是——”我还没来得及多想，餐厅就到了。","He strode from the room, and I followed.In crossing the hall, I wondered what Mrs. Crimsworth might be. “Is she,” thought I, “as alien to what I like as Tynedale, Seacombe, the Misses Seacombe, as the affectionate relative now striding before me, or is she better than these?Shall I, in conversing with her, feel free to show something of my real nature, or—” Further conjectures were arrested by my entrance into the dining-room."
"一盏灯点亮着，被罩在毛玻璃罩内，屋内四壁用橡木装饰，灯光下餐厅显得很是美观。晚餐摆置在桌上。壁炉边站着一位太太，仿佛在等我们的来临。她很年轻，身材高挑，体态匀称；衣着大方、时髦。一眼看过去只能看到这些。她和克利姆斯沃思先生愉快地互致了问候。她半开玩笑半责备式地数落他回来晚了。她的声音（我总爱拿声音来评判一个人的性格）活泼；我想，这表明她脾气不错。克利姆斯沃思先生给了她一个亲吻回应了她那甜蜜的责备——那个亲吻仍然充满着新郎的柔情蜜意（他们结婚还未满一年）。她满心欢喜坐到餐桌前。这时她注意到了我的存在。她对她刚才没注意到我表示了歉意，然后同我握了握手，就像女士们那样，高兴的时候对谁都热情，即使是熟人中最不在意的人也那样。我这才看清楚，她肤色健康，轮廓清晰，十分协调；她的头发是红色的——很红。她和爱德华不时交谈，总是开玩笑般地在争辩。他谈到那天他乘坐一匹烈马拉的双轮马车，还取笑她胆小时，她生气了，或许是假装生气。偶尔，她也和我搭几句话。","A lamp, burning under a shade of ground-glass, showed a handsome apartment, wainscoted with oak.Supper was laid on the table.By the fireplace, standing as if waiting our entrance, appeared a lady.She was young, tall, and well-shaped; her dress was handsome and fashionable.So much my first glance sufficed to ascertain.A gay salutation passed between her and Mr. Crimsworth.She chid him, half playfully, half poutingly, for being late.Her voice (I always take voices into the account in judging of character) was lively; it indicated, I thought, good animal spirits.Mr. Crimsworth soon checked her animated scolding with a kiss—a kiss that still told of the bridegroom (they had not yet been married a year).She took her seat at the supper-table in first-rate spirits.Perceiving line, she begged my pardon for not noticing me before, and then shook hands with me, as ladies do when a flow of good-humour disposes them to be cheerful to all even the most indifferent of their acquaintance.It was now further obvious to me that she had a good complexion, and features sufficiently marked but agreeable; her hair was red—quite red.She and Edward talked much, always in a vein of playful contention.She was vexed, or pretended to be vexed, that he had that day driven a vicious horse in the gig, and he made light of her fears.Sometimes she appealed to me."
"“威廉先生，爱德华这么讲话是不是很荒谬？他说他要套杰克，不要其他的马，可那畜生都摔过他两回了。”","“Now, Mr. William, isn’t it absurd in Edward to talk so?He says he will drive Jack, and no other horse, and the brute has thrown him twice already.”"
"她说话的时候有点咬舌头，但不会令人不舒服，只是有点孩子气。很快我又发现，在她那一点也不娇小的五官上有着一种更甚于孩子气——应该说是很稚嫩的表情。我敢肯定，她的舌音和表情在爱德华眼里很有吸引力，而且对大多数男人来说也是如此，但我却不这么认为。我注视着她的眼睛，极力想从中找出未能从她脸上或谈话中找寻到的智慧。她的眼睛尽管很小，但给人愉悦的感觉。我从她那眼波里时而看到生气，时而看到虚荣，时而看到妩媚，但怎么样也见不到灵魂。我毕竟不是东方人。她没有像普罗米修斯般的火焰，在花朵凋谢、头发变灰白之后还会燃烧，细颈、樱唇、红颊以及缕缕光泽闪耀的卷发都不足以吸引我。花朵在阳光下，在盛开的季节里是美丽的；但是人生总会有许多雨天——灾难的十一月总会来临，这就好比一个男人的炉膛和家如果没有明亮欢快的智慧之光，会变得冷冰冰。","She spoke with a kind of lisp, not disagreeable, but childish.I soon saw also that there was more than girlish—a somewhat infantine expression in her by no means small features.This lisp and expression were, I have no doubt, a charm in Edward’s eyes, and would be so to those of most men, but they were not to mine.I sought her eye, desirous to read there the intelligence which I could not discern in her face or hear in her conversation.It was merry, rather small.By turns I saw vivacity, vanity, coquetry, look out through its irid, but I watched in vain for a glimpse of soul.I am no oriental.Mite necks, carmine lips and cheeks, clusters of bright curls, do not suffice for me without that Promethean spark which will live after the roses and lilies are faded, the burnished hair grown gray.In sunshine, in prosperity, the flowers are very well; but how many wet days are there in life—November seasons of disaster, when a man’s hearth and home would be cold indeed without the clear, cheering gleam of intellect!"
"仔细看过克利姆斯沃思太太的脸之后，我失望得不由自主地深叹了口气。她以为我的叹息是为她的美貌所惊叹，而爱德华，他显然是为有这么有钱又漂亮年轻的太太引以为豪，半讥半怒地瞅了我一眼。","Having perused the fair page of Mrs. Crimsworth’s face, a deep, involuntary sigh announced my disappointment.She took it as a homage to her beauty, and Edward, who was evidently proud of his rich and handsome young wife, threw on me a glance, half ridicule, half ire."
"我将目光从他们身上移开，漫不经心地环视房间四周，看到橡木框镶嵌的两幅画——壁炉两边各一幅。我不再参与克利姆斯沃思夫妇的打情骂俏，开始欣赏起这些画来。这两幅是肖像图——一位女士与一位绅士，他们的装束都是二十年前的打扮。绅士在阴影中。我看不太清楚。女士的画像刚好被灯罩里柔和的灯光照射着。我即刻认出她来了。我小时候看过这幅画。这是我母亲的画像——她的画像和另一幅画像是我父亲遗产中仅存的遗物。","I turned from them both, and gazing wearily round the room, I saw two pictures set in the oak panelling—one on each side of the mantelpiece.Ceasing to take part in the bantering conversation that flowed on between Mr. and Mrs. Crimsworth, I bent my thoughts to the examination of these pictures.They were portraits—a lady and a gentleman, both costumed in the fashion of twenty years ago.The gentleman was in the shade.I could not see him well.The lady had the benefit of a full beam from the softly shaded lamp.I presently recognized her.I had seen this picture before in childhood.It was my mother—that and the companion picture being the only heirlooms saved out of the sale of my father’s property."
"我记得我小时候很喜欢那张脸，但当时我不知道为什么喜欢；现在我知道了，这样的面容在这个时代的世界是多么珍贵，我十分欣赏那深思却又慈祥的表情。那庄重的灰眼睛深深吸引了我，面部的某些线条也显示出最真挚最温柔的感情。很遗憾这只是张画像。","The face, I remembered, had pleased me as a boy, but then I did not understand it; now I knew how rare that class of face is in the world, and I appreciated keenly its thoughtful yet gentle expression.The serious gray eye possessed for me a strong charm, as did certain lines in the features indicative of most true and tender feeling.I was sorry it was only a picture."
"不一会儿，我便离开了克利姆斯沃思夫妇；仆人将我带到了卧室。关上房门，我就将所有的闯入者都拒之门外了——你，查尔斯，还有其他人。就此停笔。","I soon left Mr. and Mrs. Crimsworth to themselves; a servant conducted me to my bedroom.In closing my chamber door, I shut out all intruders—you, Charles, as well as the rest.Good-bye for the present."
"威廉·克利姆斯沃思","WILLIAM CRIMSWORTH."
"这封信我从未收到回信。在我这位旧友收到这封信之前，他就接受了政府的任命，已经在去往一个殖民地上任的路上了。自此之后我就不知道他的情况了。","To this letter I never got an answer.Before my old friend received it, he had accepted a Government appointment in one of the colonies, and was already on his way to the scene of his official labours.What has become of him since I know not."
"原先，我打算利用我的闲暇时间为他一个人提供休闲娱乐的材料，现在我决定把这些奉献给广大读者。我的故事不太激动人心，更谈不上美妙绝伦；但它也许可以吸引某些和我从事一样职业的读者，他们会频频从我的经历联想到自己的经历。以上的这封信就算是开场白吧。我现在要开始讲了。","The leisure time I have at command, and which I intended to employ for his private benefit, I shall now dedicate to that of the public at large.My narrative is not exciting, and above all, not marvellous; but it may interest some individuals, who, having toiled in the same vocation as myself, will find in my experience frequent reflections of their own.

"第二章","CHAPTER II"
"我初到克利姆斯沃思家时是十月的一个傍晚，雾蒙蒙的，第二天清晨天气却很晴朗。我早早起来，在房屋四周如同公园般的大草坪上散步。秋日的太阳从郡里的山顶冉冉升起，呈现出一派乡村美景；棕色的树林和草坪点缀着刚刚收割过的田野；一条小河流淌于树林间，河面上映射着十月的太阳与天空冰冷的光芒。河岸边每隔不远就耸立着一个高高的圆柱形烟囱，宛如一座座纤细的圆塔，由此便看到半隐在树木后面的工厂，山腰的宜人之处到处都屹立着像克利姆斯沃思公馆般的豪宅。整个乡村呈现出一派欣欣向荣、美丽富饶的景象。船运、贸易以及机械业的兴起早将乡村这世外桃源般的浪漫气息消除殆尽了。五英里外，低山环绕成的杯状山谷环抱着伟大的X镇。镇上常年被浓雾笼罩着。这里就是爱德华的“公司”所在地。","A fine October morning succeeded to the foggy evening that had witnessed my first introduction to Crimsworth Hall.I was early up and walking in the large park-like meadow surrounding the house.The autumn sun, rising over the shire hills, disclosed a pleasant country; woods brown and mellow varied the fields from which the harvest had been lately carried; a river, gliding between the woods, caught on its surface the somewhat cold gleam of the October sun and sky;at frequent intervals along the banks of the river, tall, cylindrical chimneys, almost like slender round towers, indicated the factories which the trees half concealed; here and there mansions, similar to Crimsworth Hall, occupied agreeable sites on the hillside; the country wore, on the whole a cheerful, active, fertile look.Stream, trade, machinery had long banished from it all romance and seclusion.At a distance of five miles, a valley, opening between the low hills, held in its cups the great town of X—.A dense, permanent vapour brooded over this locality.There lay Edward’s ‘concern.’"
"我强迫自己欣赏眼前的景色，强迫自己的思绪片刻地停留于此。可是，我发现，眼前的景色并不能使我心情愉悦——它并不能激起我心中的那种希望，那种一个人看到自己一生的事业就在眼前时应有的希望——我告诉自己‘威廉啊，你真是不识时务的人。你是个大傻瓜，连自己想要什么都不知道；你已经选择了经商，你就该成为一个商人。看！’我继续思索着——‘看空中那浓黑的烟雾，那里就是你的岗位！你不能在那里做梦，你不能在那里思索，不能讲理论；你得在那做点实事！’","I forced my eye to scrutinize this prospect, I forced my mind to dwell on it for a time; and when I found that it communicated no pleasurable emotion to my heart—that it stirred in me none of the hopes a man ought to feel when he sees laid before him the scene of his life’s career—I said to myself ‘William, you are a rebel against circumstances.you are a fool, and know not what you want; you have chosen trade and you shall be a tradesman. Look!’ I continued mentally—‘look at the sooty smoke in that hollow, and know that there is your post!There you cannot dream, you cannot speculate and theorize; there you shall out and work!’"
"把自己教育一番之后，我回到了屋里。哥哥在餐厅里。见到他时我很平静。我不能很激动地见他。他站在地毯上，背朝炉火。当我走上前去向他道早安时，我们目光相遇的那一刻，我从他的眼神里读懂了很多东西——他的本性和我的本性多么矛盾啊！他草草回了一句“早安”，点了点头，然后抓起——不是拿起——一张报纸读起来，还摆出一副主人的姿态，仿佛在找借口避免与下属之间令人生厌的对话似的。幸好我已下定决心要忍耐一阵子，否则，他的态度肯定早使我刚刚尽力压制的反感爆发出来。我看着他。我打量着他魁梧的身材，匀称强壮；我从壁炉上面的镜子看到自己的影子。我对比着哥哥和我在镜中的影子，把自己逗乐了。从脸部看，我长得挺像他，虽然我没他那么英俊。我的五官没他的端正。我眼睛比他的黑，眉毛比他的粗。从身材看，我比他差多了——我比较瘦削、单薄，也不如他高大。从外表上看，爱德华比我英俊多了；假如他的智商与他的外表一样极品，那我肯定就会沦为奴隶，对一个弱者，我不期待他会宽宏大量，就像狮子那样；他那冷漠、贪婪的目光，苛刻、令人生畏的态度告诉我他是不会宽恕别人的。我有足够的机智对付他吗？我不知道。我从来也没尝试过。","Thus self-schooled, I returned to the house.My brother was in the breakfast-room.I met him collectedly.I could not meet him cheerfully.He was standing on the rug, his back to the fire.How much did I read in the expression of his eye as my glance encountered his, when I advanced to bid him good-morning—how much that was contradictory to my nature!He said ‘good-morning’ abruptly and nodded, and then he snatched, rather than took, a newspaper from the table, and began to read it with the air of a master who seizes a pretext to escape the bore of conversing with an underling.It was well I had taken a resolution to endure for a time, or his manner would have gone far to render insupportable the disgust I had just been endeavouring to subdue.I looked at him.I measured his robust frame and powerful proportions; I saw my own reflection in the mirror over the mantelpiece.I amused myself with comparing the two pictures.In face I resembled him, though I was not so handsome.My features were less regular.I had a darker eye, and a broader brow.In form I was greatly inferior—thinner, slighter, not so tall.As an animal, Edward excelled me far; should he prove as paramount in mind as in person, I must be a slave, for I must expect from him no lion-like generosity to one weaker than himself; his cold, avaricious eye, his stem, forbidding manner, told me he would not spare.Had I then force of mind to cope with him?I did not know.I had never been tried."
"克利姆斯沃思太太走进来，打断了我的思绪一会儿。她看起来气色不错，穿着白色的衣服，红润的脸颊与之在清晨交相辉映，宛如新娘子般容光焕发。我很自然地同她打招呼，这与她昨晚不刻意的欢快态度是很相称的，但她的回答却显得冷漠而拘束。她丈夫教导过她，不许和职员过于随便。","Mrs. Crimsworth’s entrance diverted my thoughts for a moment.She looked well, dressed in white, her face and her attire shining in morning and bridal freshness.I addressed her with the degree of ease her last night’s careless gaiety seemed to warrant, but she replied with coolness and restraint.Her husband had tutored her: she was not to he too familiar with his clerk."
"早餐一结束，克利姆斯沃思先生提示我仆人们在门口准备马车，他希望我五分钟之内做好准备，与他同去X镇。我没让他久等；很快我们便驰骋在路上了。他套的马正是克利姆斯沃思太太昨晚提及的令她胆战心惊的那匹烈马。有一两回，杰克似乎不太听话，但是主人手中无情的鞭子有力果断地抽打着它，很快便将它降服了，爱德华扩张的鼻孔显示出斗争胜利的光辉。在整个短暂的路途中，他很少和我讲话，只是不时张嘴骂他的马几句。","As soon as breakfast was over, Mr. Crimsworth intimated to me that they were bringing the gig round to the door, and that in five minutes he should expect me to be ready to go down with him to X—.I did not keep him waiting; we were soon dashing at a rapid rate along the road.The horse he drove was the same vicious animal about which Mrs. Crimsworth had expressed her fears the night before.Once or twice Jack seemed disposed to turn restive, but a vigorous and determined application of the whip from the ruthless hand of his master soon compelled him to submission, and Edward’s dilated nostril expressed his triumph in the result of the contest.He scarcely spoke to me during the whole of the brief drive, only opening his lips at intervals to damn his horse."
"我们驶入X镇上时，到处是一派喧嚣的气氛。马车驶过干净的街道，街道两旁是居民房、商店、教堂和公共建筑群，我们驶过所有这些，拐进了一片工厂与仓库区。从这，我们穿过两扇大门到了一个地面铺设平整的大院子，这就是比格本大院。工厂在我们前面，长长的烟囱吐着煤烟，振动着穿过厚实的壁砖，墙上的铁管也一块抖动着。工人们来来往往，一辆马车正在装货。克利姆斯沃思先生四周看了看，似乎一眼就明白了眼前发生的一切。他跳下马车，把马和马车交给另一个人，这个人从他手中匆匆接过缰绳后，他便叫我随他去账房。我们走进一个与克利姆斯沃斯公馆客厅完全不一样的地方，这是一个办公场所，光秃秃的厚木地板上摆着一个保险柜、两张高桌、几张垫凳和几把椅子。一个人坐在其中一张桌子旁。克利姆斯沃思先生一进来，他便脱下方帽致敬，即刻又投入工作去了，不知道是在写什么还是算什么。","X— was all stir and bustle when we entered it.We left the clean streets where there were dwelling-houses and shops, churches, and public buildings; we left all these, and turned down to a region of mills and warehouses.Thence we passed through two massive gates into a great paved yard, and we were in Bigben Close, and the mill was before us, vomiting soot from its long chimney, and quivering through its thick brick walls with the commotion of its iron bowels.Work-people were passing to and fro; a wagon was being laden with pieces.Mr. Crimsworth looked from side to side, and seemed at one glance to comprehend all that was going on. He alighted, and leaving his horse and gig to the care of a man who hastened to take the reins from his hand, he bid me follow him to the counting-house.We entered it—a very different place from the parlours of Crimsworth Hall—a place for business, with a bare, planked floor, a safe, two high desks and stools, and some chairs.A person was seated at one of the desks, who took off his square cap when Mr. Crimsworth entered, and in an instant was again absorbed in his occupation of writing or calculating, I know not which."
"克利姆斯沃思先生脱下雨衣，坐在火炉边。我仍然站在炉膛旁边。不久，他便说道：","Mr. Crimsworth, having removed his mackintosh, sat down by the fire.I remained standing near the hearth.He said presently,"
"“斯泰格顿，你可以出去了。我要与这位先生谈点事情。等听到铃声时你再进来。”","‘Steighton, you may leave the room.I have some business to transact with this gentleman.Come back when you hear the bell.’"
"在桌子边的那个人站起来离开了，出去时还关上了门。克利姆斯沃思先生拨弄了一下炉火，然后抱着双臂，坐在那儿沉思片刻，双唇紧闭，眉头紧皱。我没事可做，只好看着他。他的容貌的确俊俏。好一个英俊的男子！那么，在他狭窄而棱角分明的前额上，在他整个的面部轮廓中，哪来那种盛气凌人的气势呢？","The individual at the desk rose and departed, closing the door as he went out. Mr. Crimsworth stirred the fire, then folded his arms, and sat a moment thinking, his lips compressed, his brow knit.I had nothing to do but to watch him. How well his features were cut!What a handsome man he was!Whence, then, came that air of contraction, that narrow and hard aspect on his forehead, in all his lineaments?"
"他突然转头开口问我：","Turning to me, he began abruptly,—"
"“你来郡上就是为了学做一名商人？”","‘You are come down to shire to learn to he a tradesman?’"
"“是啊，我正是此意。”","‘Yes, I am.’"
"“在这点上，你已经下定决心了？你得马上让我知道。”","‘Have you made up your mind on the point?Let me know that at once.’"
"“是的。”","‘Yes.’"
"“好吧。我并没有义务要帮助你，但是如果你胜任的话，我这刚好有个空缺。我可以让你试试。你会什么呢？除了大学里学的诸如希腊语、拉丁语等没用的东西之外，你还会什么？”","‘Well, I am not bound to help you, but I have a place here vacant, if you are qualified for it. I will take you on trial.What can you do?Do you know anything besides that useless trash of college learning—Greek, Latin, and so forth?’"
"“我有学数学。”","‘I have studied mathematics.’"
"“废话！我肯定你学过。”","‘Stuff!I dare say you have.’"
"“法语和德文的读写我都会。”","‘I can read and write French and German.’"
"“啊！”他想了一会，然后拉开他旁边的抽屉，拿出一封信给我。","‘Hum!’ He reflected a moment, then opening a drawer in a desk near him, took out a letter, and gave it to me."
"“你看得懂这封信吗？”他问道。","‘Can you read that?’ he asked."
"那是封德语商务信函。我把信翻译给他听。我看不出来他满意与否。他一直板着个脸。","It was a German commercial letter.I translated it. I could not tell whether he was gratified or not.His countenance remained fixed."
"“很好，”停了一会儿，他说道，“你还学了一些有用的东西，这可以让你赚点生活费。既然你懂法语与德文，我就让你做我的二等秘书，负责处理与国外的信件往来。我会给你一份不错的薪水——年薪九十磅；而现在，”他提高嗓门接着说，“我就一次性说清楚我们之间的关系，免得你日后倚仗你我的关系行骗。在这点上，我很严肃的；我对此一向很反感。我不会因为是你的哥哥就包庇你什么。如果我发现你愚钝、粗心大意、游手好闲、无所事事或是犯了什么损害工厂利益的错误，我会像解雇其他员工一样解雇你。年薪九十英镑相当不错了，我希望我给你的钱能物有所值。记住，在我的工厂里做事情要踏踏实实——公事公办的习惯、感情及想法最适合我。明白吧？”","‘It is well,’ he said, after a pause, ‘that you are acquainted with something useful—something that may enable you to earn your board and lodging.Since you know French and German, I will take you as second clerk to manage the foreign correspondence of the house.I shall, give you a good salary—£90 a year; and now,’ he continued, raising his voice, ‘hear once for all what I have to say about our relationship, and all that sort of humbug.I must have no nonsense on that point; it would never suit me.I shall excuse you nothing on the plea of being my brother.If I find you stupid, negligent, dissipated, idle, or possessed of any faults detrimental to the interests of the house, I shall dismiss you as I would any other clerk.Ninety pounds a year are good wages, and I expect to have the full value of my money out of you.Remember, too, that things are on a practical footing in my establishment: business-like habits, feelings, and ideas suit me best.Do you understand?’"
"“明白了些。”我回答说。“我想，你的意思是说我拿你的薪水是要为你做事，而不是期望你的恩惠，也不是指望你的任何资助，只能靠我自己赚钱。这正合我意。我接受这些条件，同意当你的秘书。”","‘Partly,’ I replied.‘I suppose you mean that I am to do my work for my wages, not to expect favour from you, and not to depend on you for any help but what I earn.That suits me exactly, and on these terms I will consent to be your clerk.’"
"我转身走到窗前。这次，我没有去读他的表情，了解他的想法。他有什么想法我不知道，我那时也不想知道。几分钟沉默之后，他又开始说：","I turned on my heel, and walked to the window.This time I did not consult his face to learn his opinion.What it was I do not know, nor did I then care.After a silence of some minutes he recommenced,—"
"“或许你希望能住在克利姆斯沃思公馆的房间里，与我一同搭马车上班。但我希望你能理解，这样的安排对我不太方便。我想把马车的空位留给那些和我洽谈生意的人，我会想带他们去我的住所呆上一两个晚上。你就在X镇上找住的地方吧。”","‘You perhaps expect to be accommodated with apartments at Crimsworth Hall, and to go and come with me in the gig.I wish you, however, to be aware that such an arrangement would be quite inconvenient to me.I like to have the seat in my gig at liberty for any gentleman whom for business reasons I may wish to take down to the hall for a night or so. You will seek out lodgings in X—.’"
"离开窗边，我走回炉边。","Quitting the window, I walked back to the hearth."
"“我当然会在X镇上找个住宿的地方。”我回答说。“住在你家我也不方便。”","‘Of course I shall seek out lodgings in X—,’ I answered.‘It would not suit me either to lodge at Crimsworth Hall.’"
"我的语气很平静。我通常是心平气和地说话。然而，克利姆斯沃思先生的蓝眼睛却露出怒火。他的报复方式很奇怪。他转身朝我直言不讳地说：","My tone was quiet.I always speak quietly.Yet Mr. Crimsworth’s blue eye became incensed.He took his revenge rather oddly.Turning to me, he said bluntly,—"
"“我想，你生活已经很拮据了。在领到这季的薪水之前，你打算怎么生活？”","‘You are poor enough, I suppose.How do you expect to live till your quarter’s salary becomes due?’"
"“我过得去。”我回答说。","‘I shall get on,’ said I."
"“你怎么过？”他提高声音，重复问道。","‘How do you expect to live?’ he repeated in a louder voice."
"“我尽量吧，克利姆斯沃思先生。”","‘As I can, Mr. Crimsworth.’"
"“冒着风险去借钱，是这样吧。”他说道。“据我所知，你有贵族那种铺张浪费的习气吧。如果你有，改掉这些习惯。在这儿，我绝不容忍这类习气，我绝不会多给你一分钱，记住，不论你欠下多大的债务也不会。”","‘Get into debt at your peril, that’s all!’ he answered.‘For aught I know, you may have extravagant aristocratic habits.If you have, drop them.I tolerate nothing of the sort here, and I will never give you a shilling extra, whatever liabilities you may incur; mind that.’"
"“我明白，克利姆斯沃思先生，你会发现我记忆力很好。”","‘Yes, Mr. Crimsworth, you will find I have a good memory.’"
"我没有再说什么。我觉得此时没有必要与他多说。我本能地觉得经常跟爱德华这种人怄气是十分愚蠢的。我心想，“我的忍耐力就像个杯子，上面不断滴下水来，杯子会稳稳地立着不动，一旦满了，就会溢出来。这时，要忍耐。有两点可以肯定。我有能力做好克利姆斯沃思先生给我的工作。我本着自己的良心赚钱，这些钱足够我生活。至于哥哥对我摆出的那副盛气凌人和苛刻的主人架子，那是他的错，不是我的；难道他对我的不公与恶劣的态度就可以马上改变我选择的道路？不！至少在我改变主意之前，我会向前走得足够远，好让自己看到自己事业的走向在哪里。如今我只是被挤在门口——这是一个很狭窄的入口；但会有一个好出路。”就在我思考的同时，克利姆斯沃思先生按了铃。他的一等秘书，就是刚才我们会面前出去的那位，走了进来。","I said no more.I did not think the time was come for much parley.I had an instinctive feeling that it would be folly to let one’s temper effervesce often with such a man as Edward.I said to myself, ‘I will place my cup under this continual dropping; it shall stand there still and steady; when full, it will run over of itself.Meantime, patience.Two things are certain.I am capable of performing the work Mr. Crimsworth has set me.I can earn my wages conscientiously, and those wages are sufficient to enable me to live.As to the fact of my brother assuming towards me the bearing of a proud, harsh master, the fault is his, not mine; and shall his injustice, his bad feeling, turn me at once aside from the path I have chosen?No; at least, ere I deviate, I will advance far enough to see whither my career tends.As yet I am only pressing in at the entrance—a strait gate enough; it ought to have a good terminus.’ While I thus reasoned, Mr. Crimsworth rang a bell.His first clerk, the individual dismissed previously to our conference, re-entered."
"“斯泰格顿先生，”他吩咐道，“把沃斯兄弟公司的来信给威廉先生，把英文的回复也给他看。由他来翻译。”","‘Mr. Steighton,’ said he, ‘show Mr. William the letters from Voss Brothers, and give him English copies of the answers.He will translate them.’"
"斯泰格顿先生急忙执行命令；他大约三十五岁的光景，长着一张狡猾又阴沉的脸。他把信件放在桌上，我即刻坐下，开始把英文的回复翻译成德文。第一次靠自己的努力赚钱的喜悦感涌上心头——这种喜悦感并未因雇主在场而受到影响或减弱。他站在我旁边监视着我写了一会儿。我以为他在揣测我的个性，但是我感到很放心，就像我戴了一顶放下面甲的头盔一样，或者说我给他展现出一副信心十足的样子，就好像给毫无学问的人看用希腊文写的信件一样。他或许可以看到一行一行的文字，看到一个个字母，但是他却看不懂什么意思。我的个性与他的个性不一样，我的表情对他就像一门外语的文字。不久，他便突然转身离开了账房，一副困惑的样子。那天他又来了账房两次。每次来的时候他总要从壁炉一边的橱柜拿出自制的掺水白兰地，喝一杯。看了一眼我的翻译之后——他会法语和德文——他便又一声不响地出去了。","Mr. Steighton, a man of about thirty-five, with a face at once sly and heavy, hastened to execute this order.He laid the letters on the desk, and I was soon seated at it, and engaged in rendering the English answers into German.A sentiment of keen pleasure accompanied this first effort to earn my own living—a sentiment neither poisoned nor weakened by the presence of the taskmaster, who stood and watched me for some time as I wrote.I thought he was trying to read my character, but I felt as secure against his scrutiny as if I had had on a casque with the visor down, or rather I showed him my countenance with the confidence that one would show an unlearned man a letter written in Greek.He might see lines, and trace characters, but he could make nothing of them.My nature was not his nature, and its signs were to him like the words of an unknown tongue.Ere long he turned away abruptly, as if baffled, and left the counting-house.He returned to it but twice in the course of that day. Each time he mixed and swallowed a glass of brandy-and-water, the materials for making which he extracted from a cupboard on one side of the fireplace.Having glanced at my translations—he could read both French and German—he went out again in silence."

"我恪尽职守地当着爱德华的二等秘书，守时又勤恳。他分配给我的工作，我有能力也有决心去做好它。克利姆斯沃思先生严格地检查着我的工作是否有疏漏，但是一处也找不到。他还吩咐他的心腹，首席秘书蒂莫西·斯泰格顿来监视我的工作。蒂姆也未有所获。我，和他一样，做事精密，但比他快。克利姆斯沃思先生问我怎么生活，是否欠了钱。不，我与房东的账目总是很清楚的。我用我在伊顿节省积攒的一点微薄的零花钱设法租了一小间房屋。因为我生性讨厌向别人借钱，所以我早就养成了经济上克制自己的习惯，对每月的开销都是精打细算，为的就是避免将来出现紧急情况而不得不求助他人的险境。我记得当时很多人叫我守财奴，而对于这些责骂，我这样安慰自己——与其被人误解也不要日后招人嫌。今天我总算有回报了。过去我就有过这样的回报，在和那些被惹恼的舅父们分别时，其中一位在我面前的桌上扔了一张五英镑的纸币，但我把钱留在那里没拿，说我的路费已经有了。克利姆斯沃思先生还吩咐蒂姆去打听我的房东是否对我的品行有什么不满。房东太太回答说她相信我是个非常虔诚的教徒，她甚至还反问蒂姆，问他是否认为我打算日后进教堂任职；她说她曾经有几位年轻的房客是助理牧师，那些人一点都不及我稳重、安静。蒂姆自己也是个“虔诚的教徒”——事实上，他是个“卫理公会教徒”，这不影响他同时又是个十足的混蛋（随你怎么理解）；听人说我很虔诚，他很为难地离开了。他把了解的一切都告知了克利姆斯沃思先生，可这个正人君子自己从没去过教堂，他不相信上帝，只相信财神，把这消息当成对付我文静性格的武器。他开始在背后一再嘲笑我，起初我没觉察出来这种意味，直到有一天房东太太偶然提及她和斯泰格顿先生的那次谈话。我这才醒悟过来。从此以后，我去账房时都会做好准备，设法接受工厂主对我的侮辱、嘲弄，当下一轮攻击再对准我时，只能碰上一个用冷漠铸成的难以穿透的圆盾。不久他便厌倦了这种把弹药浪费在雕塑身上的攻击，但他并没有丢弃利箭——他只是悄悄地把它们放在箭囊中。在我工作期间，我曾经应邀去过克利姆斯沃思公馆一次。那次是去参加主人庆祝生日举办的一次大型晚会。在类似的纪念日里，他通常会邀请自己的职员参加，不请我也说不过去。但我只被安排在一个不引人注意的地方。克利姆斯沃思太太身着绣边绸缎，很是优雅，显出一副青春焕发、神采飞扬的样子，她没怎么理我，只是远远跟我打了个招呼；当然，克利姆斯沃思先生从没有和我说过话。在这间又长又大的房间的另一边坐着一排青年女子，他们穿着白云般的薄纱和薄棉布衣服，正好在我的对面，但没人给我引见她们中的任何一个。实际上，我很孤独，只能注视着远处那些闪耀的身影。当厌倦这令人目眩的场景时，我便低头研究起地毯图案来。克利姆斯沃思先生站在地毯上，手肘支在大理石壁炉上，与一群围在他身边的十分美丽的女子愉快地交谈着——克里姆斯沃思先生，就在这时，瞥了我一眼。我看起来一副厌倦、孤独的样子，活像一个被冷落的家庭教师。他感到心满意足。舞会开始了。我多希望有人把我引见给一位招人喜欢、聪明伶俐的姑娘，也希望有自由和机会向人展示，我也能领略并传达社交的乐趣，总之，我不是一块木头或一件家具，而是一个有活动能力、善于思考的有血有肉的人。一张张笑脸，一个个优美的身影从我眼前飘然而过，但这些笑脸是摆给别人看的，这些身影是由他人而非我的手牵着。我感到可望而不可及，便转身离开那些舞者，漫步到橡木镶嵌的餐厅里。这个公馆里的一切生物对我没有丝毫的同情。我寻找着母亲的画像，终于，找到了。我从烛台上拿下一根蜡烛，举了起来。我热切地久久凝视着画像，整个心都扑在画像上。我发现，我遗传了母亲的大致相貌与面容——她的前额、眼睛与肤色。自负的人不管看到多么标致的美人也不及看到自己被润色、被美化的形象高兴。正是出于这个原因，父亲们会心满意足地看着女儿的脸形，时常在她们的脸上发现自己的影子，更讨他们喜欢的是，她们的脸色更加柔和，线条更加优美。我在想，这幅画对我来说很有意思，却不知一个没有私心的观众会怎么看，突然背后很近的地方有人说道：“嗯！这张脸有点意思。”我转过身去。在我的身边站着一位高大的男子，虽然他可能比我大五六岁，但也很年轻。从其它方面看，他的容貌显得与众不同——尽管我现在还没详细描述他的外貌，读者肯定会对我刚才的勾勒满意的，暂时我看到的就是这些。我没有细看他眉毛的颜色，也没有看他眼睛的颜色。但我看清楚了他的身材，他的轮廓。我还看到了他的朝天鼻，看起来一副吹毛求疵的样子。这些观察很简单，也很笼统（最后一点除外），可这样就够了，因为已经足以让我记住此人。“晚上好，亨斯登先生。”我弯腰致敬，低声问候道。说完，我开始往外走，像一个害羞的傻瓜一样。为什么会这样？　原因很简单，因为亨斯登先生是个制造商，也是个工厂主，而我只是个职员，我下意识地逼迫自己远离职位比我高的人。我在比格本大院经常见到亨斯登先生，他几乎每周都去那里同克利姆斯沃思先生谈生意，但我从未与他说过话，他也没有同我交谈过，我不由自主地对他有些怨意，因为他不止一次目睹爱德华侮辱我而默不作声。我确信他只把我看成是一个懦弱的奴隶，因此我走开了，避免同他碰面和交谈。“你上哪儿去？”当我徐徐走到一旁时他问道。我早注意到亨斯登先生喜欢突如其来地发话，我固执地自言自语:“他以为他可以随便对一个小小的职员发话，但我的个性绝不是他想像的那么温顺，他那粗暴的随性真让我讨厌。”我冷淡地、不太礼貌地敷衍了他几句，继续往前走。他冷冷地拦住了我。“在这儿呆一会儿，”他说道，“舞厅里太热了，况且你又不跳舞。你今晚没有舞伴。”他说得没错，但他说话的表情、语气以及态度都没有令我厌烦。这使我的自尊心得到了宽慰。他跟我搭话并不是屈尊俯就，而是因为到凉快的餐厅里提一下神时，他需要有一个人陪他说说话，暂时娱乐娱乐。我讨厌向别人屈服，但我喜欢帮助别人。于是我留下来了。“那是一幅不错的画像。”他继续说道，话题又回到画像上。“你觉得画中的脸庞漂亮吗？”我问道。“漂亮！不。眼睛深陷，双颊凹陷，怎么称得上漂亮呢？但是这幅画很特别，画里的人像是在沉思。如果这个女人还活着，你可以和她聊聊除了衣饰、社交以及恭维话之外的话题。”我同意他的看法，只是没有说出来。他继续说。“我不欣赏这样的头脑，画中的人缺乏个性，缺乏力量。唇齿间显露出一副多愁善感的样子（他说这话的同时努努嘴），而且，在她的眉宇间、身形中都显露出一股贵族的气质。我讨厌那些贵族。” “那么，亨斯登先生，你是觉得贵族出身可以从独特的外貌和面容中看出来吗？”　“让贵族血统见鬼去吧！谁都知道那些小老爷们有‘独特的外貌与面容’,就像我们郡上的商人也有我们自己的特征一样。哪一种更好？肯定不是他们的。至于贵族女人，那就有所不同了。她们从小便开始悉心打扮，经由精心照料与教导已相当漂亮，就像东方宫廷的嫔妃一般。但是，即使拥有这种优势也不见得会占上风。拿这幅画像和克利姆斯沃思太太比比看。哪个更漂亮？”我平静地回答：“不如拿你自己和克利姆斯沃思先生比比，亨斯登先生。”“哦，克利姆斯沃思先生比我英俊，这我知道。而且他鼻子笔直，眉毛弯起，其他也都比我强。但是这些优点——如果这些算优点的话——都不是从他那贵族出身的母亲身上遗传下来的，而是从他父亲，老克利姆斯沃思身上继承下来的，我父亲经常说老克利姆斯沃思先是个真正出类拔萃的杰出人物，而且还是三个行政区里最英俊的男子。倒是你，威廉，你才是你们家有贵族气质的人，但你的英俊和你那平民气的哥哥相比差一大截。”亨斯登先生的话说得有些道理，他直率的说话方式反倒令我欣喜，因为这种方式使我相当自在。我饶有兴致地与他继续交谈着。“你是怎么知道我是克利姆斯沃思先生的弟弟的？我以为你和其他人一样，都只把我当成一个普通的小职员。”“不错，我们是这么认为的。你难道不只是一个小职员吗？你在克利姆斯沃思这里做事，他付你薪水——也是极少的薪水。”我无言以对。亨斯登先生说话开始变得傲慢起来了，但他的态度一点也没有惹恼我，只是激起我的好奇心。我希望他接着说，他也确实继续说了一会儿。“这是个荒唐的世界。”他说道。“为什么这么说，亨斯登先生？”“我就知道你会这么问。你自己就是我说的荒唐的最有力的证明。”我想他没有我的追问也会解释他的说法，所以我保持沉默。我肯定我不追问他也会解释他的说法，所以我保持沉默。“你打算成为商人吗？”他接着问道。“这个打算我三个月前认真考虑过。” “唉！你真傻。你看起来像个商人。你的脸看起来多像一张务实的、商人的脸啊！”“我的脸是上帝创造的，亨斯登先生。”“上帝给你这张脸、这个头脑，并不是要你留在X镇的。你善于想象，有对比的能力，你的自尊，你的勤恳的本性在这里能发挥什么作用呢？但是如果你喜欢比格本大院，你就呆在这儿吧。这是你自己的事，不关我的事。”  “也许，我没有其他选择了。”“那我就管不着了。你做什么，你去哪里对我来说没有什么区别。我现在已经凉下来了——我想再去跳舞。我看到有个不错的女孩和她母亲坐在沙发的角落。看看我能不能一会儿就让她成为我的舞伴。沃迪——萨姆·沃迪正朝她走去。我能阻止他吗？”亨斯登先生大步走开了。我透过敞开的折叠门看着他。他超过沃迪去邀请那位美丽的姑娘，并得意洋洋地牵走了她。那位年轻姑娘身材高挑，体态匀称丰满，衣着华丽，颇有一番爱德华·克利姆斯沃思太太的风韵。亨斯登先生带着她带劲地旋转着跳完整个华尔兹舞曲。晚上剩下的时间他都陪伴在她身边，我从姑娘神采飞扬、心满意足的表情里看得出亨斯登先生已经成功获取了姑娘的芳心。姑娘的母亲（一位裹着穆斯林头巾的矮胖女士，即勒普顿太太）看上去也很高兴。她也许是打心眼里为女儿的前景感到满意。亨斯登家族是个古老的家族；尽管约克（这是刚才与我谈话的人的名字）总是宣称自己如何不屑那显耀的出身，但内心里他很清楚，也很感激他那古老的——也许算不上显赫的——家系给他在X镇这样快速发展的地方带来的优越感。这里的居民都知道，一千个居民里也没有一个知道他们自己的祖父是谁的。再说了，亨斯登家族过去富有，至今经济上仍很独立。有人断言，约克在生意上十分成功，很有可能重振家业，恢复原先丧失的部分家产。考虑到这些现实，勒普顿太太看到亨斯登伍德的继承人忙着向她的宝贝女儿萨拉·马撒献殷勤时，她宽大的脸庞露出满意的笑容。但我可以说是旁观者清，于是很快便发现令这位母亲喜悦的理由实在是不够充足。亨斯登先生看起来更像是想让自己在别人心中留下好印象，而不太在乎别人给他留下了什么印象。我不清楚亨斯登先生是什么样的人，但是当我注视着他（我别无它事可做），他不时会给我一种外国人的感觉。从外貌和面容上看，他称得上是个英国人，尽管有些特征像高卢人；但他却没有英国人特有的羞怯。不知他从哪里学了处之泰然的技巧，他从来不会让保守的羞涩干涉他的自由与快乐。高雅倒说不上，但他绝不是粗俗之人。他不是奇怪的人——但他却不像我之前见过的任何一个人。他整体的举止风度显示他对自己十分满意。但有时候一种莫名其妙的阴影犹如月食笼罩着他的脸一般一闪而过，我觉得这像是一种信号，显示了他内心突然对自己和自己的言行产生了强烈的怀疑——我不知道是对生活、社会地位、将来的前景、还是对智力水平的强烈的不满。或许，说到底这也只是他脾气暴躁，性格阴晴不定罢了。","I served Edward as his second clerk faithfully, punctually, diligently.What was given me to do I had the power and the determination to do well.Mr. Crimsworth watched sharply for defects, but found none.He set Timothy Steighton, his favourite and head man, to watch also.Tim was baffled.I was as exact as himself, and quicker.Mr. Crimsworth made inquiries as to how I lived whether I got into debt.No; my accounts with my landlady were always straight.I had hired small lodgings, which I contrived to pay for out of a slender fund, the accumulated savings of my Eton pocket-money; for as it had ever been abhorrent to my nature to ask pecuniary assistance, I had early acquired habits of self-denying economy, husbanding my monthly allowance with anxious care, in order to obviate the danger of being forced, in some moment of future exigency, to beg additional aid.I remember many called me miser at the time, and I used to couple the reproach with this consolation—better to be misunderstood now than repulsed hereafter.At this day I had my reward.I had had it before, when on parting with my irritated uncles one of them threw down on the table before me a £5 note, which I was able to leave there, saying that my travelling expenses were already provided for.Mr. Crimsworth employed Tim to find out whether my landlady had any complaint to make on the score of my morals.She answered that she believed I was a very religious man, and asked Tim, in her turn, if he thought I had any intention of going into the Church some day; for, she said, she had had young curates to lodge in her house who were nothing equal to me for steadiness and quietness.Tim was ‘a religious man’ himself—indeed, he was ‘a joined Methodist,’ which did not (be it understood) prevent him from being at the same time an engrained rascal; and he came away much posed at hearing this account of my piety.Having imparted it to Mr. Crimsworth, that gentleman, who himself frequented no place of worship, and owned no God but Mammon, turned the information into a weapon of attack against the equability of my temper.He commenced a series of covert sneers, of which I did not at first perceive the drift, till my landlady happened to relate the conversation she had had with Mr. Steighton.This enlightened me.Afterwards I came to the counting-house prepared, and managed to receive the mill-owner’s blasphemous sarcasms, when next levelled at me, on a buckler of impenetrable indifference.Ere long he tired of wasting his ammunition on a statue, but he did not throw away the shafts—he only kept them quiet in his quiver.Once during my clerkship I had an invitation to Crimsworth Hall.It was on the occasion of a large party given in honour of the master’s birthday.He had always been accustomed to invite his clerks on similar anniversaries, and could not well pass me over.I was, however, kept strictly in the background.Mrs. Crimsworth, elegantly dressed in satin and lace, blooming in youth and health, vouchsafed me no more notice than was expressed by a distant move; Crimsworth, of course, never spoke to me.I was introduced to none of the band of young ladies who, enveloped in silvery clouds of white gauze and muslin, sat in array against me on the opposite side of a long and large room; in fact, I was fairly isolated, and could but contemplate the shining ones from afar, and when weary of such a dazzling scene, turn for a change to the consideration of the carpet pattern.Mr. Crimsworth, standing on the rug, his elbow supported by the marble mantelpiece, and about him a group of very pretty girls, with whom he conversed gaily—Mr. Crimsworth, thus placed, glanced at me.I looked weary, solitary, kept down like some desolate tutor or governess.He was satisfied.Dancing began.I should have liked well enough to be introduced to some pleasing and intelligent girl, and to have freedom and opportunity to show that I could both feel and communicate the pleasure of social intercourse, that I was not, in short, a block or a piece of furniture, but an acting, thinking, sentient man.Many smiling faces and graceful figures glided past me, but the smiles were lavished on other eyes, the figures sustained by other hands than mine.I turned away tantalized, left the dancers, and wandered into the oak-panelled dining-room.No fibre of sympathy united me to any living thing in this house.I looked for and found my mother’s picture.I took a waX—taper from a stand, and held it up.I gazed long earnestly; my heart grew to the image.My mother, I perceived, had bequeathed to me much of her features and countenance—her forehead, her eyes, her complexion.No regular beauty pleases egotistical human beings so much as a softened and refined likeness of themselves; for this reason, fathers regard with complacency the lineaments of their daughters’ faces, where frequently their own similitude is found flatteringly associated with softness of hue and delicacy of outline.I was just wondering how that picture, to me so interesting, would strike an impartial spectator, when a voice close behind me pronounced the words,—‘Humph! there’s some sense in that face.’ I turned.At my elbow stood a tall man, young, though probably five or six years older than I, in other respects of an appearance the opposite to commonplace—though just now, as I am not disposed to paint his portrait in detail, the reader must be content with the silhouette I have just thrown off; it was all I myself saw of him for the moment.I did not investigate the colour of his eyebrows, nor of his eyes either.I saw his stature, and the outline of his shape.I saw, too, his fastidious-looking retroussé  nose.These observations, few in number, and general in character (the last excepted), sufficed, for they enabled me to recognize him.‘Good-evening, Mr. Hunsden,’ muttered I with a bow; and then, like a shy noodle as I was, I began moving away, and why?Simply because Mr. Hunsden was a manufacturer and a mill-owner, and I was only a clerk, and my instinct propelled me from my superior.I had frequently seen Hunsden in Bigben Close, where he came almost weekly to transact business with Mr. Crimsworth, but I had never spoken to him, nor he to me, and I owed him a sort of involuntary grudge, because he had more than once been the tacit witness of insults offered by Edward to me.I had the conviction that he could only regard me as a poor-spirited slave, wherefore I now went about to shun his presence and eschew his conversation.‘Where are you going?’ asked he, as I edged off sideways.I had already noticed that Mr. Hunsden indulged in abrupt forms of speech, and I perversely said to myself,—‘He thinks he may speak as he likes to a poor clerk, but my mood is not, perhaps, so supple as he deems it, and his rough freedom pleases me not at all.’ I made some slight reply, rather indifferent than courteous, and continued to move away.He coolly planted himself in my path.‘Stay here awhile,’ said he—‘it is so hot in the dancing-room; besides, you don’t dance.You have not had a partner tonight.’ He was right, and as he spoke neither his look, tone, nor manner displeased me.My amour-propre was propitiated.He had not addressed me out of condescension, but because, having repaired to the cool dining-room for refreshment, he now wanted some one to talk to by way of temporary amusement.I hate to be condescended to, but I like well enough to oblige.I stayed.‘That is a good picture,’ he continued, recurring to the portrait.‘Do you consider the face pretty?’ I asked.‘Pretty! No.How can it be pretty, with sunk eyes and hollow cheeks?But it is peculiar; it seems to think.You could have a talk with that woman, if she were alive, on other subjects than dress, visiting, and compliments.’ I agreed with him, but did not say so.He went on.‘Not that I admire a head of that sort; it wants character and force.There’s too much of the sensitive (so he articulated it, curling his lip at the same time) in that mouth; besides, there is aristocrat written on the brow and defined in the figure.I hate your aristocrats.’‘You think, then, Mr. Hunsden, that patrician descent may be read in a distinctive cast of form and features?’ ‘Patrician descent be hanged!Who doubts that your lordlings may have their “distinctive cast of form and features” as much as we shire tradesmen have ours?But which is the best?Not theirs assuredly.As to their women, it is a little different.They cultivate beauty from childhood upwards, and may by care and training attain to a certain degree of excellence in that point, just like the oriental odalisques.Yet even this superiority is doubtful.Compare the figure in that frame with Mrs. Edward Crimsworth.Which is the finer animal?’ I replied quietly, ‘Compare yourself and Mr. Edward Crimsworth, Mr. Hunsden.’ ‘Oh, Crimsworth is better filled up than I am, I know; besides, he has a straight nose, arched eyebrows, and all that.But these advantages—if they are advantages—he did not inherit from his mother, the patrician, but from his father, old Crimsworth, who, my father says, was as veritable a shire blue-dyer as ever put indigo in a vat, yet withal the handsomest man in the three ridings.It is you, William, who are the aristocrat of your family, and you are not as fine a fellow as your plebeian brother by a long chalk.’ There was something in Mr. Hunsden’s point-blank mode of speech which rather pleased me than otherwise, because it set me at my ease.I continued the conversation with a degree of interest.‘How do you happen to know that I am Mr. Crimsworth’s brother?I thought you and everybody else looked upon me only in the light of a poor clerk.’ ‘Well, and so we do; and what are you but a poor clerk?You do Crimsworth’s work, and he gives you wages—shabby wages they are too.’ I was silent.Hunsden’s language now bordered on the impertinent, still his manner did not offend me in the least; it only piqued my curiosity.I wanted him to go on, which he did in a little while.‘This world is an absurd one,’ said he.‘Why so, Mr. Hunsden?’ ‘I wonder you should ask.You are yourself a strong proof of the absurdity I allude to.’ I was determined he should explain himself of his own accord, without my pressing him so to do, so I resumed my silence.‘Is it your intention to become a tradesman?’ he inquired presently.‘It was my serious intention three months ago.’ ‘Humph!The more fool you.You look like a tradesman.What a practical, businesslike face you have!’‘My face is as the Lord made it, Mr. Hunsden.’‘The Lord never made either your face or head for X—.What good can your bumps of ideality, comparison, self-esteem, conscientiousness, do you here?But if you like Bigben Close, stay there.It’s your own affair, not mine.’  ‘Perhaps I have no choice.’‘Well, I care nought about it.It will make little difference to me what you do or where you go; but I’m cool now—want to dance again; and I see such a fine girl sitting in the corner of the sofa there by her mamma.See if I don’t get her for a partner in a jiffy!There’s Waddy—Sam Waddy—making up to her.Won’t I cut him out?’ And Mr. Hunsden strode away.I watched him through the open folding-doors.He outstripped Waddy, applied for the hand of the fine girl, and led her off triumphant.She was a tall, well-made, full-formed, dashingly-dressed young woman, much in the style of Mrs. E. Crimsworth. Hunsden whirled her through the waltz with spirit; he kept at her side during the remainder of the evening, and I read in her animated and gratified countenance that he succeeded in making himself perfectly agreeable.The mamma, too (a stout person in a turban—Mrs. Lupton by name), looked well pleased; prophetic visions probably flattered her inward eye. The Hunsdens were of an old stem; and scornful as Yorke (such was my late interlocutor’s name) professed to be of the advantages of birth, in his secret heart he well knew and fully appreciated the distinction his ancient if not high lineage conferred on him in a mushroom place like X—, concerning whose inhabitants it was proverbially said that not one in a thousand knew his own grandfather.Moreover, the Hunsdens, once rich, were still independent; and report affirmed that Yorke bade fair, by his success in business, to restore to pristine prosperity the partially decayed fortunes of his house.These circumstances considered, Mrs. Lupton’s broad face might well wear a smile of complacency as she contemplated the heir of Hunsden Wood occupied in paying assiduous court to her darling Sarah Martha.I, however, whose observations being less anxious were likely to be more accurate, soon saw that the grounds for maternal self-congratulation were slight indeed.The gentleman appeared to me much more desirous of making than susceptible of receiving an impression.I know not what it was in Mr. Hunsden that, as I watched him (I had nothing better to do), suggested to me, every now and then, the idea of a foreigner.In form and features he might be pronounced English, though even there one caught a dash of something Gallic; but he had no English shyness.He had learned somewhere, somehow, the art of setting himself quite at his ease, and of allowing no insular timidity to intervene as a barrier between him and his convenience or pleasure.Refinement he did not affect, yet vulgar he could not be called.He was not odd no quiz—yet he resembled no one else I had ever seen before.His general bearing intimated complete, sovereign satisfaction with himself; yet at times an indescribable shade passed like an eclipse over his countenance, and seemed to me like the sign of a sudden and strong inward doubt of himself, his words and actions—an energetic discontent at his life or his social position, his future prospects or his mental attainments, I know not which; perhaps, after all, it might only be a bilious caprice."
"第四章","CHAPTER IV"
"没有人愿意承认自己选错了职业，每个真正的人总要在与风浪搏斗一番后才会喊：‘我不行了！’然后才听天由命地漂回陆地。从我住在X镇的第一个星期起，我就觉得自己的职业令人厌烦。工作本身——抄写和翻译商业信函——已经足够枯燥无味了，但如果是仅仅仅如此，我也会长期忍受这份令人厌倦的工作。我并不是一个天生缺乏耐心的人，况且，在两重欲望——一是为了维持生计，一是为了给自己、也给别人证明我成为商人的决心——的影响下，我本应该默默忍受自己最杰出的才能被埋没、被限制。我不应该喃喃自语，说自己渴望自由，甚至内心也不应该有此想法。在狭窄闭塞、烟雾缭绕、单调无趣、吵吵闹闹的比格本大院，我的内心可能会冒险流露出痛苦忧郁，以及对更自由、更清新的环境的强烈渴望，我应该压制每一次这样的叹息。我应该请来责任之神和毅力之神，把它们当成我的家神供奉在我在金太太的寄宿宿舍租的小卧室里。这样我那亲爱的、私下里很珍视的脆弱或强大的幻想，不管软磨还是硬逼，也绝不会让我改变。但境况比这更糟糕。我和雇主之间所产生的厌恶越积越深，阴影日益浓厚，使我的生活见不到一丝阳光。我开始觉得自己像一颗长在黏湿的井壁上的植物，周围一片潮湿，暗无光日。","No man likes to acknowledge that he has made a mistake in the choice of his profession, and every man worthy of the name will row long against wind and tide before he allows himself to cry out, ‘I am baffled!’ and submits to be floated passively back to land.From the first week of my residence in X— I felt my occupation irksome.The thing itself—the work of copying and translating business letters was a dry and tedious task enough, but had that been all I should long have borne with the nuisance.I am not of an impatient nature, and, influenced by the double desire of getting my living and justifying to myself and others the resolution I had taken to become a tradesman, I should have endured in silence the rust and cramp of my best faculties.I should not have whispered, even inwardly, that I longed for liberty.I should have pent in every sigh by which my heart might have ventured to intimate its distress under the closeness, smoke, monotony, and joyless tumult of Bigben Close, and its panting desire for freer and fresher scenes.I should have set up the image of Duty, the fetish of Perseverance, in my small bedroom at Mrs. King’s lodgings, and they two should have been my household gods, from which my darling, my cherished-in-secret, Imagination, the tender and the mighty, should never, either by softness or strength, have severed me.But this was not all.The antipathy which had sprung up between myself and my employer striking deeper root and spreading denser shade daily, excluded me from every glimpse of the sunshine of life; and I began to feel like a plant growing in humid darkness out of the slimy walls of a well."
"爱德华·克利姆斯沃思对我的感情只能用厌恶这个词来形容——这种感情多半是无意识流露出来的。我的每一个最细微的动作、每个表情或每句话都有可能激起他的厌恶。我的南方口音惹恼了他；我的语言能力体现了我的教育程度，这也激怒了他；我上班守时、工作勤快、做事的准确也招致了他的讨厌，让他对我更加憎恨，并产生了极其浓烈的嫉妒心；他唯恐我日后也成为一名成功的商人。假如我有一方面比他差，他也不至于那么恨我；但是我掌握了所有他掌握的知识，更糟糕的是，他怀疑我悄悄锁着自己的精神财富，不与他分享。如果他有一次可以将我置于荒谬或受辱的境地，他或许会大大宽恕我，但是我有三大能力护身——谨慎、机智、善于观察；尽管爱德华居心叵测地暗中打探我，却从未逃脱过我这些天然哨兵的锐利的眼睛。他每日都心怀敌意地监视着我，希望我的机警能沉睡，这样他便可以趁机像毒蛇一般偷袭我；但是真正的机警是永远都不会有沉睡的时候。","Antipathy is the only word which can express the feeling Edward Crimsworth had for me—a feeling, in a great measure, involuntary, and which was liable to be excited by every, the most trifling, movement, look, or word of mine.My southern accent annoyed him; the degree of education evinced in my language irritated him; my punctuality, industry, and accuracy fixed his dislike, and gave it the high flavour and poignant relish of envy; he feared that I too should one day make a successful tradesman.Had I been in anything inferior to him, he would not have hated me so thoroughly; but I knew all that he knew, and, what was worse, he suspected that I kept the padlock of silence on mental wealth in which he was no sharer.If he could have once placed me in a ridiculous or mortifying position, he would have forgiven me much, but I was guarded by three faculties—caution, tact, observation; and prowling and prying as was Edward’s malignity, it could never baffle the lynX—eyes of these, my natural sentinels.Day by day did his malice watch my tact, hoping it would sleep, and prepared to steal snake-like on its slumber; but tact, if it be genuine, never sleeps."
"我领到第一季度的薪水后，我正要回到住所，满心欣喜，因为我的雇主对我辛苦挣的微薄收入的一分一毫都给得不情不愿。（我很早以前便不把克利姆斯沃思先生当哥哥了。他是个冷酷的、压榨工人的雇主。他希望自己是个无情专横的人，仅此而已。）简单但是强烈的思想占据了我的头脑。两种声音在我的内心响起；它们一次又一次重复着同样的话语。一个声音说：“威廉，你的生活是不堪忍受的。”另一个声音说：“你能做什么改变这种生活？”这是一月份的一个严寒霜冻的的晚上，我走得很快。快要走到住所时，我的思绪从对事情的宏观考虑转移到了对细节的思考：我的炉火是否已经灭了。我朝客厅的窗户望去，没看见有令人振奋的红色的光芒在闪耀。","I had received my first quarter’s wages, and was returning to my lodgings, possessed heart and soul with the pleasant feeling that the master who had paid me grudged every penny of that hard-earned pittance.(I had long ceased to regard Mr. Crimsworth as my brother.He was a hard, grinding master.He wished to be an inexorable tyrant, that was all.)Thoughts, not varied but strong, occupied my mind.Two voices spoke within me; again and again they uttered the same monotonous phrases.One said, ‘William, your life is intolerable.’The other, ‘What can you do to alter it?’ I walked fast, for it was a cold, frosty night in January.As I approached my lodgings, I turned from a general view of my affairs to the particular speculation as to whether my fire would be out.Looking towards the window of my sitting-room, I saw no cheering red gleam."
"“那懒婆娘仆人又像往常一样忘记烧火了,” 我自言自语道，“我进去看不到别的，只能看到白白的灰烬。今晚星光灿烂，很不错。我再多走走吧。”","‘That slut of a servant has neglected it as usual,’ said I, ‘and I shall see nothing but pale ashes if I go in. It is a fine starlight night; I will walk a little farther.’"
"今晚天气晴朗，街道地面干燥，对X镇来说，甚至是干净的了。可以看见教区教堂的塔边挂着一弯新月，月光闪烁，四周天空中繁星密布，亮晶晶地闪耀着。","It was a fine night, and the streets were dry and even clean for X—.There was a crescent curve of moonlight to be seen by the parish church tower, and hundreds of stars shone keenly bright in all quarters of the sky."
"不知不觉中我走向了郊区。我已经来到格罗夫大街，看到街道尽头环抱着郊区房屋的朦胧的树木，不禁心感愉悦，这条街道整齐的住宅前面有几个的小花园，一个人依靠在其中一个花园的铁门上。我迈着快步匆匆走过时，那人对我说起话来。","Unconsciously I steered my course towards the country.I had got into Grove Street, and began to feel the pleasure of seeing dim trees at the extremity, round a suburban house when a person leaning over the iron gate of one of the small gardens which front the neat dwelling-houses in this street addressed me as I was hurrying with quick stride past."
"“怎么这么匆忙？当年洛特料想到燃烧的黄铜云要倾泻而下，降大火于所多玛城时，他肯定也是如此匆忙地逃离此城。”","‘What the deuce is the hurry?Just so must Lot have left Sodom, when he expected fire to pour down upon it out of burning brass clouds.’"
"我马上停了下来，望向讲话的人。我闻到香烟的味道，然后又看到香烟的红色火花。同时我看到一个男子模糊的轮廓正对着我倚在小门上。","I stopped short, and looked towards the speaker.I smelt the fragrance and saw the red spark of a cigar.The dusk outline of a man, too, bent towards me over the wicket."
"“你瞧，日暮时分我正在田间沉思呢。”这个身影继续说道。“上帝知道这是多么枯燥的事啊！尤其是这可不像丽贝卡戴着手镯、鼻环骑在骆驼背上，上帝只给我一个以灰色斜纹软呢遮体的账房秘书职位。”","‘You see I am meditating in the field at eventide,’ continued this shade.‘God knows it’s cool work, especially as instead of Rebecca on a camel’s hump, with bracelets on her arms and a ring in her nose, Fate sends me only a counting-house clerk, in a gray tweed wrapper.’"
"这声音听起来很熟悉。从第二句话我听出来说话的是谁了。","The voice was familiar to me.Its second utterance enabled me to seize the speaker’s identity."
"“亨斯登先生！晚上好！”","‘Mr. Hunsden!Good-evening.’"
"“晚上确实很好！如果我不是如此礼貌地与你搭话，恐怕你经过我身边都不知道我是谁。”","‘Good-evening, indeed!Yes, but you would have passed me without recognition if I had not been so civil as to speak first.’"
"“我没认出你来。”","‘I did not know you.’"
"“这借口太常见了！你应该认得出我。我认得你，即使你正像蒸汽机般往前走着。有警察在后面追你吗？”","‘A famous excuse!You ought to have known me. I knew you, though you were going ahead like a steam-engine.Are the police after you?’"
"“我不值得他们浪费时间，我不是什么重要人物，不足以吸引他们。”","‘It wouldn’t be worth their while; I’m not of consequence enough to attract them.’"
"“唉，可怜的牧羊人！啊，天啊！多么懊丧的话！从你说话的声音来判断，你肯定很沮丧！但是你既然不是逃避警察，那你又是在逃避谁呢？魔鬼吗？","‘Alas, poor shepherd!Alack and well-a-day!What a theme for regret, and how down in the mouth you must be judging from the sound of your voice!But since you’re not running from the police, from whom are you running?The devil?"
"“恰恰相反，我正追捕魔鬼呢。”","‘On the contrary, I am going post to him.’"
"“很好。你运气很好。现在是周二晚上。今晚有许多赶集的双轮马车和手推车要返回迪尼福特，每辆车上一定坐着魔鬼或者魔鬼手下的小鬼；所以，如果你进来到我那单身汉客厅坐上半小时，你不费吹灰之力就可以看到他。不过，我想今晚你就放过他吧，他有很多客户要招待。周二他在X镇和迪尼福特都很忙。不管怎样，进来吧。”","‘That is well; you’re just in luck.This is Tuesday evening.There are scores of market gigs and carts returning to Dinneford tonight, and he, or some of his, have a seat in all regularly; so, if you’ll step in and sit half an hour in my bachelor’s parlour, you may catch him as he passes without much trouble.I think, though, you’d better let him alone to-night, he’ll have so many customers to serve.Tuesday is his busy day in X—and Dinneford.Come in, at all events.’"
"他边说边把门打开了。","He swung the wicket open as he spoke."
"“你真想让我进去吗？”我问道。","‘Do you really wish me to go in?’ I asked."
"“随你的便。我就一个人。你要能陪我一两个小时，我很高兴；如果你不肯，我也不强求。我讨厌烦到别人。”","‘As you please.I’m alone.Your company for an hour or two would be agreeable to me; but if you don’t choose to favour me so far, I’ll not press the point.I hate to bore any one.’"
"接受邀请正合我意，这也正合亨斯登先生的意思。我穿过大门，跟着他来到前门。他打开前门，我们从那里穿过一个过道，进入他的客厅。他关上客厅门，并指了指炉边的扶手椅。我坐了下来，并看了看四周。","It suited me to accept the invitation as it suited Hunsden to give it.I passed through the gate, and followed him to the front door, which he opened; thence we traversed a passage, and entered his parlour.The door being shut, he pointed me to an arm-chair by the hearth.I sat down and glanced round me."
"房间很舒服，既舒适又美观。明亮的火炉内燃烧着名副其实的X镇之火——通红、透亮、大气——不像英国吝啬的南方人，烧过的灰烬还要堆积在壁炉的角落里。桌上有盏罩灯，散发出柔、温馨而又均匀的光。屋内摆着一张沙发和两张十分舒适的椅子，壁炉架两旁凹陷的地方嵌着书架；书架上摆满了东西，井井有条；这样的家具摆设对一个年轻单身汉来说，可以算得上是奢侈豪华。房间干净整洁，符合我的品位；我讨厌无规律、散漫的生活习惯。就我所见，我断言亨斯登先生的在这方面的想法与我的是一致的。他从中间的桌子上挪动一些小册子和杂志到餐具柜上时，我扫了一眼离我最近的书架。主要是一些法国和德国的作品——有古老的法国戏剧家的作品，还有各种各样的现代作家作品，如梯也尔、维尔曼、保尔·德科克、乔治·桑和欧仁·休等人的作品；德国的作家诸如歌德、席勒、乔克、让·保罗·里希特的作品；还有英文作品，是关于政治经济学的。由于亨斯登先生叫我，我没再看到什么了。","It was a comfortable room, at once snug and handsome.The bright grate was filled with a genuine —shire fire, red, clear, and generous—no penurious South-of-England embers heaped in the corner of a grate.On the table a shaded lamp diffused around a soft, pleasant, and equal light.The furniture was almost luxurious for a young bachelor, comprising a couch and two very easy chairs; bookshelves filled the recesses on each side of the mantelpiece; they were well furnished, and arranged with perfect order.The neatness of the room suited my taste; I hate irregular and slovenly habits.From what I saw I concluded that Hunsden’s ideas on that point corresponded with my own. While he removed from the centre table to the sideboard a few pamphlets and periodicals, I ran my eye along the shelves of the book-ease nearest me. French and German works predominated—the old French dramatists, sundry modern authors, Thiers, Villemain, Paul de Kock, George Sand, Eugene Sue; in German—Goethe, Schiller, Zschokke, Jean Paul Richter; in English there were works on political economy.I examined no further, for Mr. Hunsden himself recalled my attention."
"“你该喝点东西。”他说道，“在这个加拿大式的晚上没人知道你走了多远，你现在应该会想喝点东西来提提神。我给你喝的既不是加水白兰地也不是波尔图葡萄酒或雪利酒。我这儿可没这些毒药。我自己喝莱茵白葡萄酒，你可以在它和咖啡之间选择。","‘You shall have something,’ said he, ‘for you ought to feel disposed for refreshment after walking nobody knows how far on such a Canadian night as this; but it shall not be brandy-and-water, and it shall not be a bottle of port, nor ditto of sherry.I keep no such poison.I have Rhein-wein for my own drinking, and you may choose between that and coffee."
"亨斯登先生的安排又一次合我的意。如果说有一种人们普遍能接受的习惯，而我却比讨厌其他东西更讨厌它的话，那就是常饮烈酒。不过，我对那酸酸的德国佳酿没兴趣，但我喜欢咖啡，所以，我回答说——","Here again Hunsden suited me. If there was one generally received practice I abhorred more than another, it was the habitual imbibing of spirits and strong wines.I had, however, no fancy for his acid German nectar, but I liked coffee, so I responded,—"
"“给我一杯咖啡，亨斯登先生。”","‘Give me some coffee, Mr. Hunsden.’"
"我发现我的回答使他愉快。他肯定原以为坚持不给我葡萄酒或烈酒会使我有些扫兴。他朝我的脸瞥了一眼，研究着我的热情是发自内心还是佯装礼貌。我笑了笑，因为我十分清楚他是怎么想的。而尽管我尊重他煞费苦心的坚持，却也对他的多疑感到好笑。他似乎很满意，按铃给我叫了咖啡，咖啡很快便端了上来；他自己则要了一串葡萄和半品托很酸的东西。咖啡味道好极了。我把这点告诉了他，并表示他隐士般的饮食触发了我对他的深深的同情。他没有回答，我差点以为他没听到我说的话。我之前提及过的短暂的沮丧爬上了他的脸庞，笑容消失了，一种心不在焉的、生疏的表情取而代之，眼睛里露露出一贯的狡诈与嘲弄的眼神。我趁这沉默的片刻，迅速审视他的外貌。我以往从没仔细观察过他，而且，我近视很严重，对他的外貌总共就了解了个模糊的总体特征。我对自己的审视吃了一惊，现在才发现原来他的脸庞狭小，轮廓甚至有些女人气。他身材高大，头发又黑又长，他的声音和总体的举止一直给我一种强壮魁梧的印象。其实不然。我自己的外貌与他相比就显得更粗犷、更魁梧。我看得出来，他的内心与他的有对比——也有矛盾，我想虽然他身体的肌肉并不发达，但他的灵魂具有足够的毅力与志向。也许在‘肉体’和‘精神’这两个对立面中隐藏着他那种间歇性忧郁的秘密。他心有余而力不足，强健的灵魂怒视着虚弱的身躯。至于他英俊的外貌，我倒想听听女士的看法。在我看来，似乎他的容貌在女士心中的引起的反响很可能和一位长得不漂亮，但是活泼风趣的女子在男士心中引起的反响一样。我刚提到他黑色的头发——梳在白皙又十分宽阔的前额两侧；他的脸颊通红，气色饱满；他的容貌若要描绘于画布上则栩栩如生，但若用大理石雕刻则会显得毫无生气。他的容貌易于塑形；每个器官都铭刻着他的个性；可以随心所欲得重新雕饰他的面部表情，雕饰出各种怪异的变体，让他时而像头脾气暴躁的公牛，时而又像个调皮淘气的小姑娘；更多时候像这两种形象的结合，一种奇异的混合表情。","I perceived my answer pleased him.He had doubtless expected to see a chilling effect produced by his steady announcement that he would give me neither wine nor spirits; he just shot one searching glance at my face to ascertain whether my cordiality was genuine or a mere feint of politeness.I smiled, because I quite understood him; and, while I honoured his conscientious firmness, I was amused at his mistrust.He seemed satisfied, rang the bell, and ordered coffee, which was presently brought; for himself, a bunch of grapes and half a pint of something sour sufficed.My coffee was excellent.I told him so, and expressed the shuddering pity with which his anchorite fare inspired me.He did not answer and I scarcely think heard my remark.At that moment one of those momentary eclipses I before alluded to had come over his face, extinguishing his smile, and replacing, by an abstracted and alienated look, the customarily shrewd, bantering glance of his eye. I employed the interval of silence in a rapid scrutiny of his physiognomy.I had never observed him closely before, and, as my sight is very short, I had gathered only a vague, general idea of his appearance.I was surprised now, on examination, to perceive how small and even feminine were his lineaments.His tall figure, long and dark locks, his voice and general bearing, had impressed me with the notion of something powerful and massive.Not at all. My own features were cast in a harsher and squarer mould than his.I discerned that there would be contrasts between his inward and outward man—contentions too, for I suspected his soul had more of will and ambition than his body had of fibre and muscle.Perhaps in these incompatibilities of the ‘physique’ with the ‘morale’ lay the secret of that fitful gloom.He would but could not, and the athletic mind scowled scorn on its more fragile companion.As to his good looks, I should have liked to have a woman’s opinion on that subject.It seemed to me that his face might produce the same effect on a lady that a very piquant and interesting though scarcely pretty female face would on a man.I have mentioned his dark locks—they were brushed sideways above a white and sufficiently expansive forehead; his cheek had a rather hectic freshness; his features might have done well on canvas but indifferently in marble.They were plastic; character had set a stamp upon each; expression recast them at her pleasure, and strange metamorphoses she wrought, giving him now the mien of a morose bull, and anon that of an arch and mischievous girl; more frequently the two semblances were blent, and a queer, composite countenance they made."
"沉默一阵之后，他开始说起来——","Starting from his silent fit, he began,—"
"“威廉，你尽可以像我一样住在格罗夫大街，有个像我的花园一样的花园，干嘛要住在金太太那阴暗的寄宿宿舍里，多傻啊！”","‘William, what a fool you are to live in those dismal lodgings of Mrs. King’s, when you might take rooms here in Grove Street, and have a garden like me!’"
"“那我离工厂就太远了。”","‘I should be too far from the mill.’"
"“那又怎么样？每天来回走两三次对你有好处；而且难道你是一块石头，从不想看看红花绿叶吗？”","‘What of that?It would do you good to walk there and back two or three times a day; besides, are you such a fossil that you never wish to see a flower or a green leaf?’"
"“我不是石头。”","‘I am no fossil.’"
"“那你是什么？你坐在克利姆斯沃思的账房里，日复一日，周复一周，用笔在纸上沙沙写着，就像一个机器人。你从未站起身；从不说累；从不请假；从不改变生活或放松一下；从不肯放纵一个晚上；也不滥交朋友或酗酒。”","‘What are you then?You sit at that desk in Crimsworth’s counting-house day by day and week by week, scraping with a pen on paper, just like an automaton.You never get up; you never say you are tired; you never ask for a holiday; you never take change or relaxation; you give way to no excess of an evening; you neither keep wild company nor indulge in strong drink.’"
"“那你这么做吗，亨斯登先生？”","‘Do you, Mr. Hunsden?’"
"“别以为你可以用这些唐突的问题难住我。你的情况和我的完全不同，试图把我们相提并论是很愚蠢的。照我说，一个耐心地忍受着不该忍受的人，他就是一块石头。”","‘Don’t think to pose me with short questions.Your case and mine are diametrically different, and it is nonsense attempting to draw a parallel.I say that when a man endures patiently what ought to be unendurable, he is a fossil.’"
"“你怎么知道我的耐性怎么样呢？”","‘Whence do you acquire a knowledge of my patience?’"
"“哈，伙计，你以为你是个谜？那天晚上你对我知道你的身世感到惊讶；现在你又对我说你耐心感到惊讶。你以为我的眼睛和耳朵干什么用的？我不止一次在账房看到克利斯沃思像对一条狗一样对你——例如，当你拿错书给他的时候，或者他认为你拿错了他就扔过去，几乎是砸到你脸上；他像奴隶般使唤你，叫你关门开门——一个月前的晚会上你的处境就不提了，既没有位子也没有舞伴，你就像一个可怜落魄的食客随从徘徊左右。在这所有的、每一次的处境中，你是如此有耐性啊。”","‘Why, man, do you suppose you are a mystery?The other night you seemed surprised at my knowing to what family you belonged; now you find subject for wonderment in my calling you patient.What do you think I do with my eyes and ears?I’ve been in your counting-house more than once when Crimsworth has treated you like a dog—called for a book, for instance, and when you gave him the wrong one, or what he chose to consider the wrong one, flung it back almost in your face; desired you to shut or open the door as if you had been his flunkey—to say nothing of your position at the party about a month ago, where you had neither place nor partner, but hovered about like a poor, shabby hanger-on.And how patient you were under each and all of these circumstances’"
"“嗯，亨斯登先生，那又怎么样？”","‘Well, Mr. Hunsden, what then?’"
"“我就很难说清楚那会怎样，关于你性格的结论取决于指引你行为的动机的性质。尽管克利姆斯沃思专制暴虐，如果你忍气吞声只是想最终从他那里得到什么，或想通过他的暴虐获取什么，你就是世人所说的唯利是图之辈，但也是个颇为聪明的人；如果你忍耐是因为你觉得你应该这样逆来顺受，那你就是十足的笨蛋，依我看你也不配做人；如果你忍耐是因为你生性冷淡平庸、难以激动，从而不奋起反抗，唉，上帝让你生来就要受人践踏，你干脆平躺下来任凭讫哩什那神车从身上碾过去。”","‘I can hardly tell you what then, the conclusion to be drawn as to your character depends upon the nature of the motives which guide your conduct.If you are patient because you expect to make something eventually out of Crimsworth notwithstanding his tyranny, or perhaps by means of it, you are what the world calls an interested and mercenary but may be a very wise fellow; if you are patient because you think it a duty to meet insult with submission, you are an essential sap and in no shape the man for my money; if you are patient because your nature is phlegmatic, flat, inexcitable, and that you cannot get up to the pitch of resistance, why, God made you to be crushed; and lie down by all means, and he flat, and let Juggernaut ride well over you.’"
"你会发觉，其实亨斯登先生的话语并非油腔滑调。他说的时候，我感到不快。我似乎从他身上看到其中一种人，他们自己十分敏感，却很自私，对他人的敏感毫无怜悯之心。另外，虽说他既不像克利姆斯沃思也不像泰尼德尔男爵，但是他言语刻薄，而且在我看来，他这样做显得傲慢自大。他急切地激励被压迫者起来反抗压迫者时，那责备意味十足的话语中带有专制的语气。我更专注地凝视着他，从他眼睛和神态里，看到了一种为了争取自己的自由可以做任何事情的决心，甚至不惜侵犯别人的自由。我脑袋里迅速浮现出这些想法，接着我不由自主地轻声笑了笑，对人类内心显露的自相矛盾的心理感触良多。这正是我想的。亨斯登先生以为我会平静地接受他错误的、冒犯的猜测和他傲慢尖刻的嘲弄，所以，他被我那比耳语大不了多少的笑声惹火了。","Mr. Hunsden’s eloquence was not, it will be perceived, of the smooth and oily order.As he spoke he pleased me ill. I seem to recognize in him one of those characters who, sensitive enough themselves, are selfishly relentless towards the sensitiveness of others.Moreover, though he was neither like Crimsworth nor Lord Tynedale, yet he was acrid, and, I suspected, overbearing in his way. There was a tone of despotism in the urgency of the very reproaches by which he aimed at goading the oppressed into rebellion against the oppressor.Looking at him still more fixedly than I had yet done, I saw written in his eye and mien a resolution to arrogate to himself a freedom so unlimited that it might often trench on the just liberty of his neighbours.I rapidly ran over these thoughts, and then I laughed a low and involuntary laugh, moved thereto by a slight inward revelation of the inconsistency of man. It was as I thought.Hunsden had expected me to take with calm his incorrect and offensive surmises, his bitter and haughty taunts, and himself was chafed by a laugh scarce louder than a whisper."
"他的眉毛阴沉下来，小小的鼻孔张大了些许。","His brow darkened, his thin nostril dilated a little."
"“不错，”他接着说道，“我说过你是贵族出身，不然还有谁会那么笑，有谁会有那样的目光——嘲弄般的冷笑，不卑不亢的反叛的目光，还有这绅士般的讽刺，贵族式的怨恨？你本可以成为一名贵族，威廉·克利姆斯沃思！你生来就是这块料；可怜的命运阻碍了天性！看你这容貌、身材，再看看你的手，处处都与众不同——令人讨厌的与众不同！现在只要你有财产，有豪宅、公园和头衔，你就可以行使特权，维护阶级的利益，训练你的佃农养成对贵族卑躬屈膝的习惯，反对日渐强大的人民力量，维护腐朽的制度，做好剥削工人心血的准备。而事实上，你没有力量，什么也做不了；你就像一艘失事的航船在商业的海滩搁浅了，你被迫与一些很现实的人发生冲突，这些人你对付不了，因为你永远成为不了一名商人。”","‘Yes,’ he began, ‘I told you that you were an aristocrat, and who but an aristocrat would laugh such a laugh as that and look such a look—a laugh frigidly jeering, a look lazily mutinous, gentlemanlike irony, patrician resentment?What a nobleman you would have made, William Crimsworth!You are cut out for one; pity Fortune has balked Nature!Look at the features, figure, even to the hands; distinction all over—ugly distinction!Now, if you’d only an estate, and a mansion, and a park, and a title, how you could play the exclusive, maintain the rights of your class, train your tenantry in habits of respect to the peerage, oppose at every step the advancing power of the people, support your rotten order, and be ready for its sake to wade knee-deep in churls’ blood.As it is, you’ve no power; you can do nothing; you’re wrecked and stranded on the shores of commerce, forced into collision with practical men, with whom you cannot cope, for you’ll never be a tradesman.’"
"亨斯登先生讲话的前一部分对我没有任何触动，即使有的话，那也只是对他的误解有些惊讶，他的偏见扭曲了他对我性格的判断。然而，最后一句话不止触动了我，更使我感到震撼；这句话给我沉重的打击，因为真理就是武器。如果我现在一笑了之，那就只是我自己对自己的藐视。","The first part of Hunsden’s speech moved me not at all, or, if it did, it was only to wonder at the perversion into which prejudice, had twisted his judgment of my character.The concluding sentence, however, not only moved but shook me; the blow it gave was a severe one, because Truth wielded the weapon.If I smiled now, it was only in disdain of myself."
"亨斯登先生看到他占了上风。他趁热打铁。","Hunsden saw his advantage.He followed it up."
"“靠经商你得不到什么，”他继续说道，“仅仅是维持生计的干面包皮和少得可怜的清水。你唯一的出头机会是娶一位富有的寡妇或是和一位女继承人私奔。”","‘You’ll make nothing by trade,’ continued he—‘nothing more than the crust of dry bread and the draught of fair water on which you now live; your only chance of getting a competency lies in marrying a rich widow or running away with an heiress.’"
"“我把这些选择留给出点子的人去实践。”我起身说道。","‘I leave such shifts to be put in practice by those who devise them,’ said I, rising."
"“甚至这种机会也是很渺茫。”他继续冷冷地说。“什么样的寡妇要你？更不用说哪个女继承人了。就寡妇来说，你不够大胆，也没有冒险精神，再说你也不够英俊迷人，能吸引到什么女继承人。你可能觉得你看起来很机智、高雅。把你的聪明才智和高雅拿到市场，悄悄写信告诉我它们能值几个钱吧。”","‘And even that is hopeless,’ he went on coolly.‘What widow would have you?Much less, what heiress?You’re not bold and venturesome enough for the one, nor handsome and fascinating enough for the other.You think perhaps you look intelligent and polished.Carry your intellect and refinement to market, and tell me in a private note what price is bid for them.’"
"亨斯登先生的语调里已有了倦意，说话语无伦次，也不想扯其它的了。我不喜欢争吵不休，这些我平日里一天到晚已经受够了，最终我总结出，沉默孤独要比刺耳的争吵声好得多；于是我向他道了晚安。","Mr. Hunsden had taken his tone for the night; the string he struck was out of tune; he would finger no other.Averse to discord, of which I had enough every day and all day long, I concluded, at last, that silence and solitude were preferable to jarring converse; I bade him good-night."
"“什么！你要走了，小伙子？好吧，晚安。你可以找到出去的门。”我走出房间，离开他家的时候，他坐在火炉前一动也不动。在回住所的途中，走了好一段路，我才发现自己步子很快，呼吸急促，指甲都快陷进紧握的手掌里了，牙也咬得紧紧的。在我意识到这些时，我即刻放慢了脚步，松开了拳头，放松了牙齿，但是我不能很快安抚迅速涌上心头的悔意。为什么我要做一名商人？我今晚为什么去亨斯登先生的家？为什么明天早上我又得去克利姆斯沃思的工厂？一整个晚上我都在问自己这些问题，一整个晚上我都强烈要求自己的内心给自己一个答复。我辗转难眠。我脑袋烧起来了，脚冻得冰凉。终于工厂的铃声响了，我和其他奴隶一样，从床上一跃而起。","‘What!Are you going, lad?Well, good-night.You’ll find the door.’ And he sat still in front of the fire, while I left the room and the house.I had got a good way on my return to my lodgings before I found out that I was walking very fast, and breathing very hard, and that my nails were almost stuck into the palms of my clenched hands, and that my teeth were set fast.On making this discovery I relaxed both my pace, fists, and jaws, but I could not so soon cause the regrets rushing rapidly through my mind to slacken their tide.Why did I make myself a tradesman?Why did I enter Hunsden’s house this evening?Why, at dawn to-morrow, must I repair to Crimsworth’s mill?All that night did I ask myself these questions, and all that night fiercely demanded of my soul an answer.I got no sleep; my head burned, my feet froze.At last the factory bells rang, and I sprang from my bed with other slaves."
"第五章","CHAPTER V"
"任何事情都有一个极点——无论是每种感情状态还是每种生活处境都是如此。在一月份的这个结霜的破晓，我匆忙冲下那陡峭的、现在还结着冰的街道，从金太太的公寓赶向大院，一路上反复思考着这个老套的道理。工厂的工人比我早来了快一个小时；当我到达工厂时，厂里已经灯火通明，全面生产。我如同往常一样走到自己在账房的岗位上。火已经有了，但是刚刚才生着，因为此时还只是冒着烟；斯泰格顿还没来。我关上门，坐在办公桌前；我的手刚刚用半冰着的水洗过，仍然是冻僵的；我得等到它们恢复知觉了才能写字，于是，我继续思考，思考的主题仍然是“极点”问题。自我不满的情绪极度地扰乱着我目前的沉思","There is a climax to everything—to every state of feeling as well as to every position in life.I turned this truism over in my mind as, in the frosty dawn of a January morning, I hurried down the steep and now icy street which descended from Mrs. King’s to the Close.The factory workpeople had preceded me by nearly an hour, and the mill was all lighted up and in full operation when I reached it. I repaired to my post in the counting-house as usual.The fire there, but just lit, as yet only smoked; Steighton was not yet arrived.I shut the door and sat down at the desk; my hands, recently washed in half-frozen water, were still numb; I could not write till they had regained vitality, so I went on thinking, and still the theme of my thoughts was the ‘climax.’ Self-dissatisfaction troubled exceedingly the current of my meditations."
"“哎，威廉·克里姆斯沃斯，”我的良知或者说是那个我们内心里总斥责我们的东西说——“哎，弄清楚你能忍受什么，或者不能忍受什么。你提到一个极限；试问，你的忍耐已经达到极限了吗？还没到四个月。你告诉泰尼德尔你要步父亲的后尘时，你以为自己将是个很有决心的家伙，还觉得自己很有可能会因此前程似锦。你多么喜欢X镇啊！就是现在，你想起它的街道，它的商店，它的货栈，它的工厂，浮现的都是多么美好的联想啊！展望一下今天，你又多么振奋啊！从早上到中午抄写信件，然后孤身一人在寄宿宿舍里吃午饭，然后又从中午到晚上抄写信件，孤独一人；因为无论是和布朗还是史密斯，尼科尔或者埃克尔在一起，你都觉得索然无味。至于亨斯登，你本以为和他在一起会有趣些——可他呀！他那个人呀！你昨晚见识过他了，滋味如何啊？讨人喜欢吗？但他是个有才能、有想法的人，就连他都不喜欢你。你的自尊心又不能容忍你喜欢他。他总是看扁你；他也会一直看扁你；你们地位不平等，即使地位平等，你们的想法也无法达到共识。所以就别指望从那棵长满刺的植物身上采集友谊之蜜了。喂，克里姆斯沃斯！你的思绪飞到哪儿去了？你赶快抛弃关于亨斯顿的回忆吧，就像蜜蜂忘记岩石，鸟儿忘记沙漠一样，你的抱负就会展开热切的翅膀飞向一片梦幻的之境，此时在即将天亮的X镇，天亮了——你还敢于梦想着与周围的人意气相投、相依相靠、和睦相处。这三点你在这个世界上永远不会遇见；它们是天使。正直而尽善尽美的人的灵魂也许能在天堂碰见它们，但是你的灵魂永远也不会完美无瑕。八点的钟声都敲响了！你的手也暖和了；去工作吧！”","‘Come, William Crimsworth,’ said my conscience, or whatever it is that within ourselves takes ourselves to task—‘come, get a clear notion of what you would have, or what you would not have.You talk of a climax; pray, has your endurance reached its climax?It is not four months old. What a fine resolute fellow you imagined yourself to be when you told Tynedale you would tread in your father’s steps, and a pretty treading you are likely to make of it.How well you like X—!Just at this moment how redolent of pleasant associations are its streets, its shops, its warehouses, its factories!How the prospect of this day cheers you!Letter-copying till noon, solitary dinner at your lodgings, letter-copying till evening, solitude; for you neither find pleasure in Brown’s, nor Smith’s, nor Nicholl’s, nor Eccle’s company.And as to Hunsden, you fancied there was pleasure to be derived from his society—he! he!How did you like the taste you had of him last night?Was it sweet?Yet he is a talented, an original-minded man, and even he does not like you.Your self-respect defies you to like him.He has always seen you to disadvantage; he always will see you to disadvantage; your positions are unequal, and were they on the same level your minds could not assimilate.Never hope, then, to gather the honey of friendship out of that thorn-guarded plant.Hallo, Crimsworth!Where are your thoughts tending?You leave the recollection of Hunsden as a bee would a rock, as a bird a desert, and your aspirations spread eager wings towards a land of visions where, now in advancing daylight in X— daylight—you dare to dream of congeniality, repose, union.Those three you will never meet in this world; they are angels.The souls of just men made perfect may encounter them in heaven, but your soul will never be made perfect.Eight o’clock strikes!Your hands are thawed; get to work!’"
"“工作！为什么我要工作？”我不高兴地说。“即使我像奴隶一样辛苦工作也无法讨好别人。”“工作，工作！”内心的声音重申道。“我可以工作；但是这没用，”我咆哮道；不管怎样我还是取出一包信函，开始我的工作——一种吃力不讨好的、痛苦的工作，就像那以色列人在被太阳烘烤的埃及田野上爬行着寻找干草和断株以完成他们的烧砖任务。","‘Work!Why should I work?’ said I sullenly.‘I cannot please though I toil like a slave.’ ‘Work, work!’ reiterated the inward voice.‘I may work; it will do no good,’ I growled; but nevertheless I drew out a packet of letters and commenced my task—task thankless and bitter as that of the Israelite crawling over the sun-baked fields of Egypt in search of straw and stubble wherewith to accomplish his tale of bricks."
"十点左右我听见克里姆斯沃斯的马车拐进了庭院里，一两分钟后他便走进了账房。他的习惯就是先瞥一眼斯泰格顿和我，挂上他的雨衣，背对着火炉站一会儿，然后走出去。今天他没有改变他的习惯；唯一的不同在于当他看我时，他的表情并不只是严厉的，而是粗暴的；他的眼神不是冷酷的，而是凶恶的。他比平常多注视了我几分钟，但还是没有说话就走了出去。","About ten o’clock I heard Mr. Crimsworth’s gig turn into the yard, and in a minute or two he entered the counting-house.It was his custom to glance his eye at Steighton and myself, to hang up his mackintosh, stand a minute with his back to the fire, and then walk out.Today he did not deviate from his usual habits; the only difference was that when he looked at me his brow, instead of being merely hard, was surly; his eye, instead of being cold, was fierce.He studied me a minute or two longer than usual, but went out in silence."
"十二点到了；响起了下班的铃声。工人们都出去吃饭了；斯泰格顿也离开了，他让我锁好账房的门并让我随身带上钥匙。我正在把信件系成一捆并将它们归位，准备合上我的办公桌抽屉时，克里姆斯沃斯再次出现在门口，他走进来，随手关上了门。","Twelve o’clock arrived; the bell rang for a suspension of labour.The workpeople went off to their dinners; Steighton too departed, desiring me to lock the counting-house door and take the key with me.I was tying up a bundle of papers and putting them in their place, preparatory to closing my desk, when Crimsworth reappeared at the door, and entering, closed it behind him."
"“你留下来会儿，”他低沉而野蛮地说，同时他的鼻孔放大，眼睛里透出凶恶的火星。","‘You’ll stay here a minute,’ said he, in a deep, brutal voice, while his nostrils distended and his eye shot a spark of sinister fire."
"和爱德华单独在一起使我记起了我们的关系，同时也就忘记了我们地位的差别。我收起了对他的顺从，也没有慎重选择言辞；只是简短地回答了他。","Alone with Edward I remembered our relationship, and remembering that forgot the difference of position.I put away deference and careful forms of speech; I answered with simple brevity."
"“该回家了。”我边说边转动桌上的钥匙。","‘It is time to go home,’ I said, turning the key in my desk."
"“你给我留下。”他重复道，“放下你手中的钥匙！让它留在锁孔里！”","‘You’ll stay here,’ he reiterated.‘And take your hand off that key!Leave it in the lock!’"
"“为什么？”我问道，“有什么理由可以改变我惯常的安排？”","‘Why?’ asked I.‘What cause is there for changing my usual plans?’"
"“按我说的做，”他这样回答，“不要多问！你是我的仆人；你就得听我的话！你都干了些什么事——”他本准备一口气说完，但是突然的停顿说明此刻他愤怒得话都说不出来了。","‘Do as I order,’ was the answer, ‘and no questions!You are my servant; obey me!What have you been about—’ He was going on in the same breath, when an abrupt pause announced that rage had for the moment got the better of articulation."
"“你要是想知道你可以看的，”我回答道。“桌子是开的，文件都在里面。”","‘You may look if you wish to know,’ I replied.‘There is the open desk, there are the papers.’"
"“大胆！你都干了些什么事？”","‘Confound your insolence!What have you been about?’"
"“干了你交待的工作，并且干得不错。”","‘Your work, and have done it well.’"
"“伪君子！胡说八道！假惺惺的，装可怜的油脂角！”（最后一个词，我相信，纯粹是某个郡的方言，指的是装着黑乎乎的腥臭鲸鱼油的牛角，常被系在车轮上，用来给车轮润滑。）","‘Hypocrite and twaddler!smooth-faced, snivelling grease-horn!’ (This last term is, I believe, purely—shire, and alludes to the horn of black, rancid whale-oil usually to be seen suspended to cart wheels, and employed for greasing the same.)"
"“算了吧，爱德华·克里姆斯沃斯，够了吧。我们是时候来算算帐了。我已经经过了你三个月的试用期，我发现这是天底下最恶心的奴隶制度了。你另寻职工吧。我不干了。”","‘Come, Edward Crimsworth, enough of this.It is time you and I wound up accounts.I have now given your service three months’ trial, and I find it the most nauseous slavery under the sun.Seek another clerk.I stay no longer.’"
"“什么！你胆敢向我辞职？看在工资的份上你还是别闹了。”他拿下了那根挂在雨衣旁边的重重的马鞭子。","‘What!Do you dare to give me notice?Stop at least for your wages.’ He took down the heavy gig-whip hanging beside his mackintosh."
"我毫不压抑自己也毫不掩饰地带着几分轻蔑的神情笑了笑。他这下气急败坏，对我破口大骂了五六句粗俗无礼的话之后，还是没敢举起鞭子，又继续说道——","I permitted myself to laugh with a degree of scorn I took no pains to temper or hide.His fury boiled up, and when he had sworn half a dozen vulgar, impious oaths, without, however, venturing to lift the whip, he continued,—"
"“我已经认清你并且看透你了，你这个卑鄙无耻，满腹牢骚、阿谀奉承之徒！你在X镇都说我什么了？回答我。”","‘I’ve found you out and know you thoroughly, you mean whining lickspittle!What have you been saying all over X— about me?Answer me that.’"
"“你？我可是既不想又没兴趣去对你说三道四。”","‘You?I have neither inclination nor temptation to talk about you.’"
"“你说谎！说我坏话是你的老把戏；你一向喜欢在公众场合抱怨你在我这边受到的待遇。你四处传播，说我给你工资低，说我像对狗一样粗鲁对待你。我倒情愿你是条狗！我现在就要动手，就在这里，非要用这条鞭子把你骨头上的一块块肉给抽下来不可。”","‘You lie!It is your practice to talk about me; it is your constant habit to make public complaint of the treatment you receive at my hands.You have gone and told it far and near that I give you low wages and knock you about like a dog.I wish you were a dog!I’d set to this minute, and never stir from the spot till I’d cut every strip of flesh from your bones with thus whip.’"
"他挥舞起他的鞭子。鞭尾刚好碰到我的前额。一股强烈的激愤之情涌过我的血管；我的血液似乎沸腾了，随后沿着血管迅速而又火辣辣地游遍全身。我快速站了起来，走到他站的地方，面对面地看着他。","He flourished his tool.The end of the lash just touched my forehead.A warm, excited thrill ran through my veins; my blood seemed to give a bound, and then raced fast and hot along its channels.I got up nimbly, came round to where he stood, and faced him."
"“放下你的鞭子，”我说，“你想怎样，现在直说吧！”","‘Down with your whip,’ said I, ‘and explain this instant what you mean!’"
"“臭小子！你现在在对谁说话？”","‘Sirrah!To whom are you speaking?’"
"“对你。我想这里也没有其他人在场了。你说我一直在恶意中伤你——抱怨你给的工资低，待遇差。你拿出说这些话的证据来。”","‘To you.There is no one else present, I think.You say I have been calumniating you—complaining of your low wages and bad treatment.Give your grounds for these assertions.’"
"克里姆斯沃斯根本没有尊严，当我坚决要求他给我一个说法时，他只会用斥责的语气大叫。","Crimsworth had no dignity, and when I sternly demanded an explanation, he gave one in a loud, scolding voice."
"“证据！你会看到证据的；你转向亮光，这样当我拿出你是骗子、伪君子的证据时，我就可以看见你的厚脸皮会因羞愧而脸红。昨天在镇务厅的公开会议上，我有幸在讨论时听到反对我的人侮辱了我，还隐射了我的私事——乱说什么我是没有人性的恶魔、家庭的暴君等诸如此类的废话；当我站起来反驳时，那一群乌合之众朝我大喊大叫，他们还提及了你，我一下就明白了这恶劣的人身攻击究竟缘何而起。我四处张望，看见了那个阴险的恶棍亨斯登，他正是始作俑者。我查到一个月之前你在我家里和亨斯登详谈过一次，我还知道你昨晚去亨斯登家里了。你要是敢否认试试看。”","‘Grounds!You shall have them; and turn to the light that I may see your brazen face blush black when you hear yourself proved to be a liar and a hypocrite.At a public meeting in the Town Hall yesterday I had the pleasure of hearing myself insulted by the speaker opposed to me in the question under discussion, by allusions to my private affairs—by cant about monsters without natural affection, family despots, and such trash; and when I rose to answer, I was met by a shout from the filthy mob, where the mention of your name enabled me at once to detect the quarter in which this base attack had originated.When I looked round, I saw that treacherous villain Hunsden acting as fugleman.I detected you in close conversation with Hunsden at my house a month ago, and I know that you were at Hunsden’s rooms last night.Deny it if you dare.’"
"“哦，我不会否认的！如果亨斯登唆使其他人说你的是非，那他做得很好。你就活该臭名远扬；因为在世上很少有比你更坏的人、更刻薄的老板、更野蛮的哥哥了。”","‘Oh, I shall not deny it!And if Hunsden hounded on the people to hiss you, he did quite right.You deserve popular execration; for a worse man, a harder master, a more brutal brother than you are has seldom existed.’"
"“臭小子！臭小子！”克里姆斯沃斯反复骂道；为了补充他后面省略的话，他“啪”地一鞭朝我头上径直甩来。","‘Sirrah! sirrah!’ reiterated Crimsworth; and to complete his apostrophe he cracked the whip straight over my head."
"仅用一分钟我就从他手里抢过鞭子，把它折成两段，扔到了炉排下面。他朝我一头撞来，我躲开了，说道，——","A minute sufficed to wrest it from him, break it in two pieces, and throw it under the grate.He made a headlong rush at me, which I evaded, and said, —"
"“你要是碰我，我就到最近的地方法官那儿起诉你。”","‘Touch me, and I’ll have you up before the nearest magistrate.’"
"像克里姆斯沃斯这种人，只要碰上坚定而冷静的反抗，傲慢气焰总是会减弱不少。他可不想去地方法官那边，而且我想他看出了我说一不二。他用奇怪的眼光瞪了我很长一段时间，愤怒不已，同时又有些吃惊；他似乎考虑到毕竟他的金钱足以使他胜过我这个乞丐一样的人一筹，而且他手上有一张比多少有点危险的人身攻击更保险并且能更体面地报复我的底牌。","Men like Crimsworth, if firmly and calmly resisted, always abate something of their exorbitant insolence.He had no mind to be brought before a magistrate, and I suppose he saw I meant what I said.After an odd and long stare at me, at once bull-like and amazed, he seemed to bethink himself that, after all, his money gave him sufficient superiority over a beggar like me, and that he had in his hands a surer and more dignified mode of revenge than the somewhat hazardous one of personal chastisement."
"“拿起你的帽子，”他说，“拿上属于你的东西，滚出这个门。滚回到你自己的教区去，你个穷鬼。你去讨饭、去偷窃、去挨饿、去流浪，你要做什么都随你的便，但是如果你胆敢再进入我的眼界，后果自负。如果我听说你踏入我的地盘一步，我就雇人给你一顿好打。”","‘Take your hat,’ said he. ‘Take what belongs to you, and go out at that door.Get away to your parish, you pauper.Beg, steal, starve, get transported, do what you like, but at your peril venture again into my sight.If ever I hear of your setting foot on an inch of ground belonging to me, I’ll hire a man to cane you.’"
"“你不可能有那样的机会的。一旦离开了你的地盘，你指望还有什么诱惑能把我吸引回来吗？我离开了一座监狱；我离开了一个暴君；我离开了一个我见过的坏到极致的东西，所以你不用担心我会回来。”","‘It is not likely you’ll have the chance.Once off your premises, what temptation can I have to return to them?I leave a prison; I leave a tyrant; I leave what is worse than the worst that can lie before me, so no fear of my coming back.’"
"“滚，否则我要赶你走了！”克里姆斯沃斯大声叫嚷道。","‘Go, or I’ll make you!’ exclaimed Crimsworth."
"我从容不迫地走回自己的办公桌，从抽屉里拿出我自己的东西放到口袋里，然后锁上抽屉，把钥匙放在了桌子上。","I walked deliberately to my desk, took out such of its contents as were my own property, put them in my pocket, locked the desk, and placed the key on the top."
"“你从抽屉里拿了什么东西？”工厂老板问道。“把它们都放回去，不然我就要警察来搜你的身了。”","‘What are you abstracting from that desk?’ demanded the mill-owner.‘Leave all behind in its place, or I’ll send for a policeman to search you.’"
"“那你得赶紧了，”我说道，然后我取下帽子，戴上手套，悠闲地走出了账房——走出去就不会再回来了。","‘Look sharp about it then,’ said I; and I took down my hat, drew on my gloves, and walked leisurely out of the counting-house—walked out of it to enter it no more."
"我想起来当工厂午饭铃声响起，克里姆斯沃斯先生进账房前，也就是以上事情发生之前，我饿得发慌，一直在急切地等着吃饭的信号。然而现在我已经忘却了饥饿。脑子里土豆和烤羊肉的形象已经被半小时之前的激动和吵闹抹去了。我只想着走路，这样或许我的肌肉行为能与我的神经活动相协调。我一直快速地走着，走得很远。不然我又能怎样？一个重荷从我心头移去；我感到轻松而无拘束。我不假思索地走出了比格本大院，自尊心丝毫没有受到损害。我并没有刻意去创造条件；我的自由来得水到渠成。生活之门又向我敞开；生活的地平线不再受到克里姆斯沃斯工厂周围那黑色高墙的限制了。两个小时过去了，我内心的激动之情才平息下来，我平静地思考，离开那个煤烟熏黑的小地方，我换来了更广阔而又更清晰的天地。我抬头看了看，瞧！我的正前方就是格罗夫镇，那是一个离X镇大概五英里的别墅村。从那西沉的太阳可以看出短暂的冬日已经接近尾声；一团刺骨的霜雾从X镇的河面上冉冉升起，河边便是我走过的小路；霜雾使得大地一片朦胧昏暗，但是无法掩盖一月那清晰冰冷而蔚蓝的天空。四周一片寂静；此刻人们尽可享受着宁静的时光，因为还没到厂里下班的时间，工人们都还在屋里工作。空气中只有哗哗的流水声，因为最近下了一场雪，雪融化后流进河里，使得河水又深又满。我倚在墙上站了一会儿，低头看那水流，注视着它汹涌的波浪。我想清楚而永久地铭记这一情景，好把它珍藏在将来的岁月里。格罗夫镇教堂的钟敲了四下。我抬头看了看那天最后的太阳，它闪烁着红光射过教堂周围古老橡树的光秃秃的树枝；那日光仿佛变了颜色，呈现出我想看的那幅图景。我驻足了一会儿，直到那美妙而缓慢的钟声完全消失在空气之中；此时我的耳朵、眼睛以及情感全都得到了满足；然后我从墙边走开，再次将脸转向了X镇。","I recollect that when the mill-bell rang the dinner hour, before Mr. Crimsworth entered and the scene above related took place, I had had rather a sharp appetite, and had been waiting somewhat impatiently to hear the signal of feeding time.I forgot it now, however.The images of potatoes and roast mutton were effaced from my mind by the stir and tumult which the transaction of the last half-hour had there excited.I only thought of walking, that the action of my muscles might harmonize with the action of my nerves.and walk I did, fast and far.How could I do otherwise?A load was lifted off my heart; I felt light and liberated.I had got away from Bigben Close without a breach of resolution, without injury to my self-respect.I had not forced circumstances; circumstances had freed me.Life was again open to me; no longer was its horizon limited by the high black wall surrounding Crimsworth’s mill.Two hours had elapsed before my sensations had so far subsided as to leave me calm enough to remark for what wider and clearer boundaries I had exchanged that sooty girdle.When I did look up, look!Straight before me lay Grovetown, a village of villas about five miles out of X—.The short winter day, as I perceived from the far-declined sun, was already approaching its close; a chill frost-mist was rising from the river on which X— stands, and along whose banks the road I had taken lay; it dimmed the earth, but did not obscure the clear icy blue of the January sky. There was a great stillness near and far; the time of the day favoured tranquillity, as the people were all employed within doors, the hour of evening release from the factories not being yet arrived.A sound of full-flowing water alone pervaded the air, for the river was deep and abundant, swelled by the melting of a late snow.I stood awhile, leaning over a wall, and looking down at the current I watched the rapid rush of its waves.I desired memory to take a clear and permanent impression of the scene, and treasure it for future years.Grovetown church clock struck four.Looking up, I beheld the last of that day’s sun, glinting red through the leafless boughs of some very old oak trees surrounding the church; its light coloured and characterized the picture as I wished.I paused yet a moment, till the sweet, slow sound of the bell had quite died out of the air; then car, eye, and feeling satisfied, I quitted the wall and once more turned my face towards X—."
"第六章","CHAPTER VI"
"我又饥肠辘辘地回到镇上。我忘了吃的午餐又充满诱惑力地涌入我的脑海，我健步如飞、饥肠辘辘地沿着通往我住所的狭窄街道向上走着。当我打开前门，走进屋子的时候，天已经黑了。我想着我的火炉会怎样。夜晚是寒冷的，当我想到炉子里全是没有火星的煤渣时，我不禁打了个冷颤。一进起居室的门，我又惊又喜，因为我发现一炉熊熊燃烧的火焰和一个干净清洁的炉台。我几乎还没来得及弄清楚状况就注意到另一件让我惊奇的事——炉台旁我经常坐的椅子已经被人占据了，一个人坐在那儿，双手抱在胸前，双腿伸长搭在地毯上。虽然我是个近视眼，而且火光闪烁不定，但我还是一下就认出了他是我的老熟人亨斯登先生。考虑到昨晚我在他家扬长而去，此时见到他我当然不会太高兴；我走到炉台那边，拨了一下火，冷冷地说了声‘晚上好’，我的行为和我的感觉一样毫不热诚。不过我自己心里也在猜想着，他出于什么原因来到这里，他又是出于什么动机如此活跃地干涉我跟爱德华之间的事情。似乎这次我有幸被开除应该归功于他。但是我仍然不能主动去问他，以免让他看出我急切的好奇心。如果他选择解释的话，他会的，但是这个解释应该是完全出于他自愿的。我觉得他立刻就要谈及这个问题。","I re-entered the town a hungry man.  The dinner I had forgotten recurred seductively to my recollection, and it was with a quick step and sharp appetite I ascended the narrow street leading to my lodgings.It was dark when I opened the front door and walked into the house.I wondered how my fire would be.The night was cold, and I shuddered at the prospect of a grate full of sparkless cinders.To my joyful surprise I found, on entering my sitting-room, a good fire and a clean hearth.I had hardly noticed this phenomenon when I became aware of another subject for wonderment—the chair I usually occupied near the hearth was already filled, a person sat there with his arms folded on his chest and his legs stretched out on the rug.Short-sighted as I am, doubtful as was the gleam of the firelight, a moment’s examination enabled me to recognize in this person my acquaintance Mr. Hunsden.I could not of course be much pleased to see him, considering the manner in which I had parted from him the night before, and as I walked to the hearth, stirred the fire, and said coolly, ‘Good-evening,’ my demeanour evinced as little cordiality as I felt; yet I wondered in my own mind what had brought him there, and I wondered also what motives had induced him to interfere so actively between me and Edward.It was to him, it appeared, that I owed my welcome dismissal.Still I could not bring myself to ask him questions, to show any eagerness of curiosity.If he chose to explain, he might, but the explanation should be a perfectly voluntary one on his part.I thought he was entering upon it."
"他的第一句话就是：“你应该向我表示感谢。”","‘You owe me a debt of gratitude,’ were his first words."
"“我应该吗？”我说道。“我希望这次恩情不要太大，因为我太穷了，偿还不起任何很重的债务。”","‘Do I?’ said I.‘I hope it is not a large one, for I am much too poor to charge myself with heavy liabilities of any kind.’"
"“那你就马上宣布自己破产吧，因为这份债务有一吨重。当我进来时，发现你的炉火灭了，就又把它生着了，并且让那个板着脸的邋遢女佣留下来用风箱吹火，直到火完全地烧起来为止。现在说声‘谢谢’吧！”","‘Then declare yourself bankrupt at once, for this liability is a ton weight.When I came in I found your fire out, and I had it lit again, and made that sulky drab of a servant stay and blow at it with the bellows till it had burnt up properly.Now say “Thank you!”’"
"“到我找到吃的东西再说吧。我非常饿的时候是不能感谢人的。”","‘Not till I have had something to eat.I can thank nobody while I am so famished.’"
"我按了铃，点了茶和一些冷肉。","I rang the bell and ordered tea and some cold meat."
"“冷肉！”仆人一关上门亨斯登就惊叫道，“喂，你还真是个贪吃的人！又吃肉又喝茶！你会因为吃太多而撑死的。”","‘Cold meat!’ exclaimed Hunsden, as the servant closed the door, ‘what a glutton you are, man!Meat with tea!You’ll die of eating too much.’"
"“不，亨斯登先生，我不会的。”我觉得我有必要跟他对着干。我饿得冒火，看见他在这里又很恼火，他那连续不断的粗鲁举止更让我火冒三丈。","‘No, Mr. Hunsden, I shall not.’ I felt a necessity for contradicting him.I was irritated with hunger, and irritated at seeing him there, and irritated at the continued roughness of his manner."
"“就是因为吃太多了，你的脾气才会这么差，”他说。","‘It is overeating that makes you so ill-tempered,’ said he."
"“你怎么知道？”我问道，“你这种人不搞清楚事情的任何状况就多管闲事地下结论。我都没有吃午饭。”","‘How do you know?’ I demanded.‘It is like you to give a pragmatical opinion without being acquainted with any of the circumstances of the case.I have had no dinner.’"
"我说得已经够暴躁而刻薄了，亨斯登却只是看着我的脸笑了笑。","What I said was petulant and snappish enough, and Hunsden only replied by looking in my face and laughing."
"“可怜的东西！”他停了一会儿，然后哀诉道。“它都还没吃午饭，是吗？什么！我想它的主人都不让它回家了。威廉，难道克里姆斯沃斯命令你禁食以惩罚你？”","‘Poor thing!’ he whined, after a pause.‘It has had no dinner, has it?What! I suppose its master would not let it come home.Did Crimsworth order you to fast by way of punishment, William?’"
"“不是的，亨斯登先生。”","‘No, Mr. Hunsden.’"
"所幸的是，在这个尴尬的关头，茶点被送进来了，我便扑到面包、黄油和冷牛肉上来。将一盘吃的一扫而空之后，我开始有点人情味，便对亨斯登先生说：“你不必坐在那里看着，如果你愿意，倒是可以过来跟我一起吃。”","Fortunately, at this sulky juncture, tea was brought in, and I fell to upon some bread and butter and cold beef directly.Having cleared a plateful, I became so far humanized as to intimate to Mr. Hunsden ‘that he need not sit there staring, but might come to the table and do as I did, if he liked.’"
"“但是我丝毫也不愿意，”他说；随即他拉了一下铃绳叫来了仆人，说要一杯泡过吐司的水。“再拿来一些煤，”他补充道。“我在这里的时候，克里姆斯沃斯先生要把火烧得旺旺的。”","‘But I don’t like in the least,’ said he; and therewith he summoned the servant by a fresh pull of the bell-rope, and intimated a desire to have a glass of toast-and-water.‘And some more coal,’ he added.‘Mr. Crimsworth shall keep a good fire while I stay.’"
"仆人去执行他的命令了，他把椅子转到桌子旁，坐在我对面。","His orders being executed, he wheeled his chair round to the table, so as to be opposite me."
"“呃，”他开始问道。“我想你失业了吧。”","‘Well,’ he proceeded.‘You are out of work, I suppose.’"
"“是的，”我答道；我不打算让他看到我对这一点的满意之情，于是我灵光一闪，接着他的话说下去，表现得就好像失业对我而言弊大于利。“是的，多亏了你，我是失业了。我一提出辞职克里姆斯沃斯便辞退了我，我明白，这都是由于你在公众大会上的干涉而造成的。”","‘Yes,’ said I; and not disposed to show the satisfaction I felt on this point, I, yielding to the whim of the moment, took up the subject as though I considered myself aggrieved rather than benefited by what had been done.‘Yes; thanks to you, I am. Crimsworth turned me off at a minute’s notice, owing to some interference of yours at a public meeting, I understand.’"
"“啊！什么！他提起那件事了？他看到我指使那些家伙了，是不是呀？关于他的朋友亨斯登他都说了些什么——说了什么好听的吗？”","‘Ah!What! he mentioned that?He observed me signalling the lads, did he?What had he to say about his friend Hunsden—anything sweet?’"
"“他说你是个阴险的恶棍。”","‘He called you a treacherous villain.’"
"“噢，那他还几乎不了解我呢。我属于那种腼腆的人，不会突然一下子抛头露面，他也才刚刚认识我，但是他会发现我有很多优良的品质——绝好的品质！我们亨斯登家族追踪坏蛋的本事可谓无人能敌；彻头彻尾的无耻恶棍就是我们天然的猎物——无论在哪里碰见丢不会放过他。你刚刚用了爱管闲事这个词：这个词可是我们家族的特性；它代代相传，直到我们这一代。我们的嗅觉对于种种劣迹都很敏感；我们能从一英里之外就嗅出一个无赖。我们生来就是改革者，激进的改革者，要我和克里姆斯沃斯住在同一个镇上，每周与他交往并且目睹他对你的恶行（对于你个人我倒是不关心，我关心的是他残忍不公的恶行妨碍了你追求平等的天性），这是不可能的——我是说，要我安之若素，将我与身俱来的家族的天使或是魔鬼的传统抛诸脑外是不可能的。我服从了我的本能，反对了暴君，打破了枷锁。”","‘Oh, he hardly knows me yet. I’m one of those shy people who don’t come out all at once, and he is only just beginning to make my acquaintance, but he’ll find I’ve some good qualities—excellent ones!The Hunsdens were always unrivalled at tracking a rascal; a downright, dishonourable villain is their natural prey—they could not keep off him wherever they met him.You used the word pragmatical just now: that word is the property of our family; it has been applied to us from generation to generation.We have fine noses for abuses; we scent a scoundrel a mile off.We are reformers born, radical reformers, and it was impossible for me to live in the same town with Crimsworth, to come into weekly contact with him, to witness some of his conduct to you (for whom personally I care nothing: I only consider the brutal injustice with which he violated your natural claim to equality)—I say it was impossible for me to be thus situated and not feel the angel or the demon of my race at work within me.I followed my instinct, opposed a tyrant, and broke a chain.’"
"他的话现在激起了我很大的兴趣，既因为它显示了亨斯登的性格，也因为它解释了亨斯登的动机；我对他的话太感兴趣了，以至于忘了回复，坐在那一言不发，沉思着它所暗示的一系列含义。","Now this speech interested me much, both because it brought out Hunsden’s character, and because it explained his motives; it interested me so much that I forgot to reply to it, and sat silent, pondering over a throng of ideas it had suggested."
"“你对我感不感激？”他不久后问道。","‘Are you grateful to me?’ he asked presently."
"事实上我是感激他的，或者说是几乎感激，而且我相信此刻我有点喜欢他了，虽然他附带说明他所做的并不是为了我。但是人的本性是倔强的。既然不可能肯定地回答他直言不讳的问题，我便否认一切感激他的倾向，并且奉劝他，如果他期待领取冠军奖赏的话，还是去一个更好的地方找吧，因为在这里是不可能找到的。他答复时称我是“一个铁石心肠的贵族式的流氓”。于是我又指责他拿走了我到嘴的面包。","In fact I was grateful, or almost so, and I believe I half liked him at the moment, notwithstanding his proviso that what he had done was not out of regard for me.But human nature is perverse.Impossible to answer his blunt question in the affirmative, so I disclaimed all tendency to gratitude, and advised him, if he expected any reward for his championship to look for it in a better world, as he was not likely to meet with it here.In reply he termed me ‘a dry-hearted aristocratic scamp,’ whereupon I again charged him with having taken the bread out of my mouth."
"“你的面包是脏的，小伙子！”亨斯登喊道——“肮脏而又腐臭！它是经过暴君的手给你的，因为我告诉你，克里姆斯沃斯是一个暴君——是工人的暴君，是职员的暴君，并且有朝一日会成为他妻子的暴君。”","‘Your bread was dirty, man!’ cried Hunsden—‘dirty and unwholesome!It came through the hands of a tyrant, for I tell you Crimsworth is a tyrant—a tyrant to his work people, a tyrant to his clerks, and will some day be a tyrant to his wife.’"
"“胡说！面包是面包，工资是工资。我已经失去了我的工资，这都是因为你从中作梗。”","‘Nonsense!Bread is bread, and a salary is a salary.I’ve lost mine, and through your means.’"
"“毕竟你说的这话还是有点道理，”亨斯登又回答说。“我必须说，听到你刚刚说的那句这么实际的话，我真是非常惊喜。从我以前对你性格的观察，我本来以为，你新近重获自由所带来的欢乐情绪应该至少在一段时期内使你缺乏远见和谨慎。现在你能坚定地追求自己必需的东西，我倒对你刮目相看了。”","‘There’s sense in what you say, after all,’ rejoined Hunsden.‘I must say I am rather agreeably surprised to hear you make so practical an observation as that last.I had imagined now, from my previous observation of your character, that the sentimental delight you would have taken in your newly-regained liberty would, for a while at least, have effaced all ideas of forethought and prudence.I think better of you for looking steadily to the needful.’"
"“坚定地追求自己必需的东西！否则我能怎么样？我必须生存，要生存我就必须拥有你所说的“必需的东西”，那只有通过工作才能得到。我再说一遍——你使我丢了工作。”","‘Looking steadily to the needful!How can I do otherwise?I must live, and to live I must have what you call “the needful,” which I can only get by working.I repeat it—you have taken my work from me.’"
"“你打算怎么办？”亨斯登冷冷地继续问道。“你有几个有影响力的亲戚，我想很快他们就能为你再找个事干的。”","‘What do you mean to do?’ pursued Hunsden coolly.‘You have influential relations: I suppose they’ll soon provide you with another place.’"
"“有影响力的亲戚？谁啊？我倒想知道他们的名号。”","‘Influential relations?Who? I should like to know their names.’"
"“西科姆家族。”","‘The Seacombes.’"
"“够了！我已经跟他们决裂了。”","‘Stuff!I have cut them.’"
"亨斯登不可置信地看着我。","Hunsden looked at me incredulously."
"“真的，”我说，“这是毋庸置疑的。”","‘I have,’ said I, ‘and that definitively.’"
"“威廉，你的意思肯定是他们已经抛弃你了。”","‘You must mean they have cut you, William.’"
"“你要怎么说都可以。他们提出要资助我，但条件是我要进入教堂供职。我既拒绝了他们的条件，也拒绝了他们的资助。我脱离了冷酷的舅舅们，甘愿投入哥哥的怀抱，简而言之，就是因为你这个陌生人残忍的搅合，我现在才失去了哥哥充满深情的怀抱。”","‘As you please.They offered me their patronage on condition of my entering the Church.I declined both the terms and the recompense.I withdrew from my cold uncles, and preferred throwing myself into my elder brother’s arms, from whose affectionate embrace I am now torn by the cruel intermeddling of a stranger of yourself, in short.’"
"我说这句话时忍不住露出了一丝笑容。与此同时亨斯登的嘴边也露出了相似的似笑非笑的神情。","I could not repress a half-smile as I said this.A similar demi-manifestation of feeling appeared at the same moment on Hunsden’s lips."
"“哦，我懂了！”他直视我的双眼说道；很显然他确实看透了我的心思。他手托着下巴坐了一两分钟，同时认真地继续观察我的表情，然后又说道，——","‘Oh, I see!’ said he, looking into my eyes; and it was evident he did see right down into my heart.Having sat a minute or two with his chin resting on his hand, diligently occupied in the continued perusal of my countenance, he went on,—"
"“老实说，你对西科姆家族真的别无所求了吗？”","‘Seriously, have you then nothing to expect from the Seacombes?’"
"“是的，只剩下拒绝和反感。你为什么问我两遍呀？我这双被账房里的墨汁玷污，又被羊毛仓库里的油脂弄脏的手，怎么可能被允许再去碰贵族的手掌呢？”","‘Yes, rejection and repulsion.Why do you ask me twice?How can hands stained with the ink of a counting-house, soiled with the grease of a wool-warehouse, ever again be permitted to come into contact with aristocratic palms?’"
"“毋庸置疑这是个难题；无论从外表、容貌、语言还是举止，你仍然是个十足的西科姆家族的人呐，我想不通他们居然与你脱离关系。”","‘There would be a difficulty, no doubt; still you are such a complete Seacombe in appearance, feature, language, almost manner, I wonder they should disown you.’"
"“他们已经不承认我了；所以不要再提这件事了。”","‘They have disowned me; so talk no more about it.’"
"“你后悔吗，威廉？”","‘Do you regret it, William?’"
"“不。”","‘No.’"
"“为什么不啊，小伙子？”","‘Why not, lad?’"
"“因为他们永远都不是那种与我志同道合之人。”","‘Because they are not people with whom I could ever have had any sympathy.’"
"“我说的是你是他们其中一员。”","‘I say you are one of them.’"
"“这只能证明你对这一切一无所知。我是我母亲的儿子，但不是我舅舅的外甥。”","‘That merely proves that you know nothing at all about it. I am my mother’s son, but not my uncles’ nephew.’"
"“但毕竟，你的一位舅舅是个勋爵，尽管地位并不显赫也不太富有；另一个舅舅也是一名官员。你应该从世故名利角度好好考虑一下。”","’Still, one of your uncles is a lord, though rather an obscure and not a very wealthy one, and the other a right honourable.You should consider worldly interest.’"
"“亨斯登先生，你都是废话。”你知道或者也许知道，即使我想顺从我的舅舅们，我也不可能卑躬屈膝来换取他们的喜爱。如果那样做的话我就会牺牲自己的安逸，反过来也不会得到他们的帮助。”","‘Nonsense, Mr. Hunsden.You know or may know that even had I desired to be submissive to my uncles, I could not have stooped with a good enough grace ever to have won their favour.I should have sacrificed my own comfort and not have gained their patronage in return.’"
"“很有可能。因此你认为你最明智的计划就是立马听随自己的意愿行事？”","‘Very likely.So you calculated your wisest plan was to follow your own devices at once?’"
"“就是这样的。我必须听随自己的意愿办事——到死都是如此——因为我不能理解、采纳或弄清楚别人的意愿。”","‘Exactly.I must follow my own devices—I must till the day of my death—because I can neither comprehend, adopt, nor work out those of other people.’"
"亨斯登打了个呵欠。“好吧，”他说，“从这一切我只看清了一点——那就是，这整件事都与我无关。”他伸了个懒腰，又打了个呵欠。“我想知道几点了。”他继续说道，“七点我还有个约会呢。”","Hunsden yawned.‘Well,’ said he, ‘in all this I see but one thing clearly—that is, that the whole affair is no business of mine.’ He stretched himself and again yawned.‘I wonder what time it is,’ he went on. ‘I have an appointment for seven o’ clock.’"
"“我的表显示是六点三刻。”","‘Three-quarters past six by my watch.’"
"“好吧，那我走了。”他站起身来。“你不打算再试身商界了？”他把胳膊撑在壁炉台上，问道：“是的，我想不了。”","‘Well, then I’ll go.’ He got up. ‘You’ll not meddle with trade again?’ said he, leaning his elbow on the mantelpiece.‘No, I think not.’"
"“要是你真那样的话你就是个傻子了。也许到最后你还是会重新考虑你舅舅们的建议，进教堂任职。”","‘You would be a fool if you did. Probably, after all, you’ll think better of your uncles’ proposal, and go into the Church.’"
"“在进教堂之前我整个人得从里到外进行一次重生。因为一个好牧师是最好的人之一。”","‘A singular regeneration must take place in my whole inner and outer man before I do that.A good clergyman is one of the best of men.’"
"“确实如此！你真这么认为吗？”亨斯登冷笑着打断我的话。","‘Indeed!Do you think so?’ interrupted Hunsden scoffingly."
"“千真万确，我是这么认为的。但是我并不具备做一个好牧师的特点；与其接受一个我没有才能胜任的职位，我倒情愿忍受贫穷所带来的极度艰辛。","‘I do, and no mistake.But I have not the peculiar points which go to make a good clergyman; and rather than adopt a profession for which I have no vocation, I would endure extremities of hardship from poverty.’"
"“你真是个极难满足的家伙。你不愿做商人也不愿做牧师，也不能成为一个律师、医生或是绅士，因为你没有钱。我建议你去旅行。”","‘You’re a mighty difficult customer to suit.You won’t be a tradesman or a parson; you can’t be a lawyer or a doctor, or a gentleman, because you’ve no money.I’d recommend you to travel.’"
"“什么！身无分文去旅行？”","‘What! without money?’"
"“你必须通过旅行寻找钱，小伙子。你会说法语——肯定会带点蹩脚的英语口音——不过你还是会说的。去欧洲大陆看看吧，看看那里有什么你能做的事。”","‘You must travel in search of money, man. You can speak French—with a vile English accent, no doubt—still, you can speak it. Go on to the Continent, and see what will turn up for you there.’"
"“上帝知道我倒是真想去呢！”我带着一股情不自禁的热情喊道。","‘God knows I should like to go!’ exclaimed I, with involuntary ardour."
"“去吧！到底还有什么妨碍着你呢？举个例子，只要你知道怎么节省用钱的话，只需五六英镑就可以到布鲁塞尔了。”","‘Go!What the deuce hinders you?You may get to Brussels, for instance, for five or six pounds, if you know how to manage with economy.’"
"“就算我不知道的话，贫苦也会教会我的。”","‘Necessity would teach me if I didn’t.’"
"“那么就去吧，到那里用你的机智闯出一条生路。我对布鲁塞尔几乎跟对X镇一样熟悉——我确信它会比伦敦更适合你这样的人。","‘Go, then, and let your wits make a way for you when you get there.I know Brussels almost as well as I know X—and I am sure it would suit such a one as you better than London.’"
"“但是工作怎么办呢，亨斯登先生！我必须去有工作的地方；在布鲁塞尔我怎么能得到推荐或者介绍或者雇佣呢？”","‘But occupation, Mr. Hunsden!I must go where occupation is to be had; and how could I get recommendation, or introduction, or employment at Brussels?’"
"“这话倒是说出了你的谨慎的一面了。你必须知道前方的每一寸路你才肯前进一步。你有纸、笔、墨没有？”","‘There speaks the organ of caution.You hate to advance a step before you know every inch of the way.You haven’t a sheet of paper and a pen and ink?’"
"“我希望有吧。”","‘I hope so.’"
"我十分乐意地拿出了笔墨纸张，因为我猜到他要干什么。他坐下，写了几行字，折叠起来，装进信封并封口，写上地址然后交给我。","I produced writing materials with alacrity, for I guessed what he was going to do. He sat down, wrote a few lines folded, sealed, and addressed a letter, and held it out to me."
"“拿着，谨慎鬼——这里有一位先锋可以为你铲除你前进道路上的第一批艰难、阻碍。我知道得很清楚，小伙子，你不是那种做事不管不顾的人，这一点你很好。我最讨厌不顾后果的鲁莽家伙，无论怎样我都不会干涉那种人的事。那些对自己就不顾后果的人，通常对朋友更会十倍地不顾后果。”","‘There, Prudence—there’s a pioneer to hew down the first rough difficulties of your path.I know well enough, lad, you are not one of those who will run their neck into a noose without seeing how they are to get out again, and you’re right there.A reckless man is my aversion, and nothing should ever persuade me to meddle with the concerns of such a one.Those who are reckless for themselves are generally ten times more so for their friends.’"
"“我想这是一份推荐信吧？”我拿着信问道。","‘This is a letter of introduction, I suppose?’ said I, taking the epistle."
"“是的。把它放到口袋里，这样你就不会陷入穷途末路的窘境；我知道，你会认为这种窘境很丢脸；要是我的话，我也会这样觉得。你把它交给那个人，他只要肯推荐，通常会提供两到三份体面的工作。”","‘Yes.With that in your pocket, you will run no risk of finding yourself in a state of absolute destitution, which, I know, you will regard as a degradation; so should I, for that matter.The person to whom you will present it generally has two or three respectable places depending upon his recommendation.’"
"“那正好适合我，”我说。","‘That will just suit me,’ said I."
"“咦，你的感谢呢？”亨斯登要求道。“难道你就不知道怎么说‘谢谢’吗？”","‘Well, and where’s your gratitude?’ demanded Mr. Hunsden.‘Don’t you know how to say “Thank you”?’"
"“我有十五英镑，还有我素未谋面的教母十八年前给我的一块表，”我答非所问；我更坦率地声明我是一个幸福的人，并且表示我不羡慕基督世界的任何一个人。","‘I’ve fifteen pounds and a watch which my godmother, whom I never saw, gave me eighteen years ago,’ was my rather irrelevant answer; and I further avowed myself a happy man, and professed that I did not envy any being in Christendom."
"“还有你的感谢呢？”","‘And your gratitude?’"
"“我马上就出发，亨斯登先生——如果一切妥当的话我明天就走。可以的话，我不会在X镇多呆一天。”","‘I shall be off presently, Mr. Hunsden—to-morrow, if all be well.I’ll not stay a day longer in X— than I’m obliged.’"
"“很好；但是要对向你提供帮助的人适当地致谢才像样啊。快点吧！马上就要到七点了。我正等着你谢我呢。”　","‘Very good; but it will be decent to make due acknowledgment for the assistance you have received.Be quick!It is just going to strike seven.I am waiting to be thanked.’"
"“亨斯登先生，请让一下好不好？我要拿壁炉台角上的钥匙。我得在睡觉之前把我的旅行皮箱整理好。”","‘Just stand out of the way, will you, Mr. Hunsden.I want a key there is on the corner of the mantelpiece.I’ll pack my portmanteau before I go to bed.’"
"屋内的钟敲了七下。","The house clock struck seven."
"“真是个不懂事的小子，”亨斯登说；他从餐具柜上拿下帽子，自顾自笑着离开了房间。我真有点想去送送他。我真的决定第二天早上就离开X镇，这样就肯定不会再有机会跟他告别了。前门“砰”地一下关起来了。","‘The lad is a heathen,’ said Hunsden; and taking his hat from a sideboard, he left the room, laughing to himself I had half an inclination to follow him.I really intended to leave X— the next morning, and should certainly not have another opportunity of bidding him good-bye.The front door banged to."
"“让他走吧，”我说。“有朝一日我们还会再见面的。”","‘Let him go,’ said I.‘We shall meet again some day.’"
"第七章","CHAPTER VII"
"读者，也许你曾来过比利时？也许你对这个国家的风貌并不了解？你并不像我一样，在记忆中对它有一个清晰的轮廓？","Reader, perhaps you were in Belgium?Haply you don’t know the physiognomy of the country?You have not its lineaments defined upon your memory as I have them on mine?"
"三幅——不对，四幅——图画挂在我“小房间”的四壁，这间小房间里收藏着我过去的记录。第一幅图画是伊顿。整幅画面都是放小的有些模糊的透视远景，但是色彩清新，郁郁葱葱，十分清爽，春日的晴空堆砌着耀眼但是蕴含着阵雨的云朵；因为我的童年并非都是阳光灿烂的日子——有着阴暗、严寒和暴雨时刻。第二幅图画是X镇——画幅巨大而色彩暗淡；画布有裂缝，也被熏黑了；画面上是昏黄的天空、乌黑的云朵；没有太阳，没有碧空。郊外的树木因被污染而枯萎了——一幅极其沉闷的景象。","Three—nay, four—pictures line the four-walled cell where are stored for me the records of the past.First, Eton.All in that picture is in far perspective, receding, diminutive, but freshly coloured, green, dewy, with a spring sky, piled with glittering yet showery clouds; for my childhood was not all sunshine—it had its overcast, its cold, its stormy hours.Second, X—, huge, dingy; the canvas cracked and smoked; a yellow sky, sooty clouds; no sun, no azure.The verdure of the suburbs blighted and sullied—a very dreary scene."
"第三幅图画是比利时；我会在这幅画前驻足片刻。至于第四幅，有一个帘子盖在上面，将来我也许会揭开它，也许不会，这得看我是否方便，是否有能力。无论如何，此时它得挂在那里不动。比利时！这是个既不浪漫又没有诗意的名字，然而一旦提及这个名字，我的耳边便会响起一个声音，在我心间形成一种共鸣，而其他的音符组合，不管多么悦耳、多么经典，都无法产生这样的效果。比利时！现在将近午夜，我独坐家中，重复着这个词语。它搅动着我以前的世界，像在召唤逝去的一切。墓穴打开，死者被唤起；我看见原先沉睡的思想、情感和记忆从肉体升起，像光环般笼罩着肉体的大部分；然而，当我凝视着它们朦胧的形状，并努力去准确地弄清楚它们的轮廓时，原先弄醒它们的声音消寂了，它们便一个接一个地全都消沉下去，犹如薄雾缭绕，又被吸回泥土，召回坟墓，封藏于碑墓之下。再见吧，发着光的幻影！","Third, Belgium; and I will pause before this landscape.As to the fourth, a curtain covers it, which I may hereafter withdraw, or may not, as suits my convenience and capacity.At any rate, for the present it must hang undisturbed.Belgium! name unromantic and unpoetic, yet name that whenever uttered has in my ear a sound, in my heart an echo, such as no other assemblage of syllables, however sweet or classic, can produce.Belgium! I repeat the word now as I sit alone near midnight.It stirs my world of the past like a summons to resurrection.The graves unclose, the dead are raised; thoughts, feelings, memories that slept are seen by me ascending from the clods, haloed most of them; but while I gaze on their vapoury forms, and strive to ascertain definitely their outline, the sound which wakened them dies, and they sink, each and all, like a light wreath of mist, absorbed in the mould, recalled to urns, resealed in monuments.Farewell, luminous phantoms!"
"读者，这就是比利时。看！别说这幅画平淡或无趣；当我第一眼看到它时，觉得既不平淡也不无趣。当我于一个温和的二月清晨离开奥斯坦德，置身于通往布鲁塞尔的路上时，一切对我来说都充满新奇。我的欢喜之情犹如一把从未用过的刀刃，已被磨得极为尖锐、锋利而又精致。我年轻，又有健康的身体。我从未领会过欢乐之情；我本性中的任何一项才能都未曾因任意行乐而受到削弱或得到满足。我第一次将自由拥入怀里，她的微笑和拥抱，犹如太阳和西风般使我的生命得到复苏。是的，在那一刻我觉得自己就像是一个早晨的旅行者，他坚信登上山峰必能看到壮美的日出。如果山路笔直、陡峭或者多石又该如何？他无视这一切。他双眼直盯山顶，已经满脸通红、汗流满面；一旦登上山顶，他必会将景色一览无遗。他知道太阳将会出现在他的面前，他的双轮战车甚至现在正从东方的地平线驶出，他脸颊上所感觉到的捷报之风正在柔软如珠、温暖如焰的云层中开辟一条清晰而宽广的碧空之路，以迎接上帝的光临。我诸多要受尽困苦艰难，但只要有活力支持，有光明而又模糊的希望引领，我觉得这一切并不是多么艰苦。现在我从山的背阴面攀登，道路上乱石满地、崎岖不平、杂草丛生，但是我的双眼直盯着上方那深红的山顶；我的想象力被引向了那遥远的灿烂天空，丝毫没顾虑到脚下滚动的乱石和不断擦伤脸庞和双手的荆棘。","This is Belgium, reader.Look! Don’t call the picture a flat or a dull one; it was neither flat nor dull to me when I first beheld it.When I left Ostend on a mild February morning, and found myself on the road to Brussels, nothing could look vapid to me.My sense of enjoyment possessed an edge whetted to the finest, untouched, keen, exquisite.I was young; I had good health.Pleasure and I had never met; no indulgence of hers had enervated or sated one faculty of my nature.Liberty I clasped in my arms for the first time, and the influence of her smile and embrace revived my life like the sun and the west wind.Yes, at that epoch I felt like a morning traveller who doubts not that from the hill he is ascending he shall behold a glorious sunrise.What if the track be strait, steep, and stony?He sees it not.His eyes are fixed on that summit, flushed already, flushed and gilded; and having gained it, he is certain of the scene beyond.He knows that the sun will face him, that his chariot is even now coming over the eastern horizon, and that the herald breeze he feels on his cheek is opening for the god’s career a clear, vast path of azure, amidst clouds soft as pearl and warm as flame.Difficulty and toil were to be my lot, but sustained by energy, drawn on by hopes as bright as vague, I deemed such a lot no hardship.I mounted now the hill in shade, There were pebbles, inequalities, briars in my path, but my eyes were fixed on the crimson peak above; my imagination was with the refulgent firmament beyond, and I thought nothing of the stones turning under my feet or of the thorns scratching my face and hands."
"我总是不时满怀喜悦地从公共马车的车窗向外望去（如果您还记得的话，那个年代还没有火车和铁路）。啊，我看到了什么？我将如实地告诉你。芦苇丛生的碧绿沼泽；一块一块开垦得像放大的菜园般的肥沃却平坦的田地；一条条修剪过的树木如同去梢的柳树那样平整，仿佛给地平线穿上了花裙；一条条小运河沿着路边缓缓地流淌；漆过的佛兰芒人的农屋；一些非常肮脏的茅舍；灰暗而死寂的天空；潮湿的道路，潮湿的田地，潮湿的屋顶。整个旅程中我并没有看见堪称美丽的东西，更少有如画般的美景，但是对我来说一切都是美丽的，这一切都比画还美。尽管前些天多日的阴雨天气已经浸透了全国，可白天依旧是晴天。然而夜幕降临之时，又开始下起雨来，我的眼睛就是透过雾气氤氲、毫无星辰的黑暗看到布鲁塞尔的第一缕灯光。那夜，除了这个城市的万家灯火外，我几乎什么都没看到。从公共马车下来，我被一辆小型四轮马车送到了某餐馆，是一位旅伴建议我来这里住宿的。吃完旅行晚餐，我便回到床上，美美地睡了一觉。","I gazed often, and always with delight, from the window of the diligence (these, be it remembered, were not the days of trains and railroads).Well, and what did I see?I will tell you faithfully.Green, reedy swamps; fields fertile but flat, cultivated in patches that made them look like magnified kitchen-gardens; belts of cut trees, formal as pollard willows, skirting the horizon; narrow canals, gliding slow by the roadside; painted Flemish farm-houses; some very dirty hovels; a gray, dead sky; wet road, wet fields, wet house-tops.Not a beautiful, scarcely a picturesque object met my eye along the whole route, yet to me all was beautiful, all was more than picturesque.It continued fair so long as daylight lasted, though the moisture of many preceding damp days had sodden the whole country.As it grew dark, however, the rain recommenced, and it was through streaming and starless darkness my eye caught the first gleam of the lights of Brussels.I saw little of the city but its lights that night.Having alighted from the diligence, a fiacre conveyed me to the Hotel de-, where I had been advised by a fellow-traveller to put up. Having eaten a traveller’s supper, I retired to bed, and slept a traveller’s sleep."
"次日早晨我从又长又香的睡眠中醒来，似乎觉得我还是在X镇，当我看到天已经大亮时，赶紧坐了起来，以为自己睡过了头，到账房会迟到。我拉开白色的床帘，看到宽敞而高级的外国房间时，渐渐意识到自己已经恢复了自由，那短暂而痛苦的受约束感才消失了。在等行李运来的时，我曾在伦敦一家体面的旅店住过一两个晚上，当时的房间尽管算不上不舒服，却狭小、肮脏，与眼前的房间比起来真是相形见绌！但是我无意亵渎对那间昏暗的小房间的记忆！它对于我的灵魂也很重要；因为在那里，当我安静地躺在黑暗之中时，第一次听到圣保罗教堂的大钟敲响，钟声告诉伦敦的人们已经到了午夜时分；我清楚地回忆起，那深沉从容的钟声充满着无比的镇定和力量。从那房间狭小的窗户我第一次看见了在伦敦薄雾中隐约可见的圆顶。我想到第一次听到的钟声、第一次看到的景色所激发的感情只能感受一次。珍藏它们吧，记忆；将它们密封在罐子里，存在一个安全的地方。好吧，我起床了。旅行者们说国外的旅馆的房间简陋而且不舒适：我却觉得我的房间看起来既堂皇又有生气。房间窗子很大——十字形的，打开了就像门一样，窗格上的玻璃那么宽大明亮；梳妆台上还有大型的梳妆镜；壁炉台上，一面如此漂亮镜子在闪闪发光；粉刷过的地板看上去那么干净而有光泽。当我穿好衣服下楼时，宽阔的大理石台阶几乎使我惊叹，它们通向的华丽大厅也使我感到惊叹。在第一个楼梯平台我碰见了一个佛兰芒女仆。她脚穿木质的鞋子，身着短装红色衬裙和印花棉睡衣；她脸膛宽阔，模样看起来十分笨拙。当我用法语跟她说话时，她用佛兰芒语回答我，态度很不礼貌。然而我还是觉得她挺有魅力。我想，如果她不漂亮也没礼貌，那她还是很别致的；她让我想起前几年在西科姆大厅见到的某些荷兰油画里的女性形象。","Next morning I awoke from prolonged and sound repose with the impression that I was yet in X—, and perceiving it to be broad daylight, I started up, imagining that I had overslept myself and should be behind time at the counting-house.The momentary and painful sense of restraint vanished before the revived and reviving consciousness of freedom, as, throwing back the white curtains of my bed, I looked forth into a wide, lofty, foreign chamber.How different from the small and dingy, though not uncomfortable, apartment I had occupied for a night or two at a respectable inn in London while waiting for the sailing of the packet!Yet far be it from me to profane the memory of that little dingy room!It too is dear to my soul; for there, as I lay in quiet and darkness, I first heard the great bell of St. Paul’s telling London it was midnight; and well do I recall the deep, deliberate tones, so full charged with colossal phlegm and force.From the small, narrow window of that room I first saw the dome, looming through a London mist.I suppose the sensations, stirred by those first sounds, first sights, are felt but once.Treasure them, Memory; seal them in urns, and keep them in safe niches.Well I rose.Travellers talk of the apartments in foreign dwellings being bare and uncomfortable: I thought my chamber looked stately and cheerful.It had such large windows—croisées that opened like doors, with such broad, clear panes of glass; such a great looking-glass stood on my dressing-table; such a fine mirror glittered over the mantelpiece; the painted floor looked so clean and glossy.When I had dressed and was descending the stairs, the broad marble steps almost awed me, and so did the lofty hall into which they conducted.On the first landing I met a Flemish housemaid.She had wooden shoes, a short red petticoat, a printed cotton bedgown; her face was broad, her physiognomy eminently stupid.When I spoke to her in French she answered me in Flemish, with an air the reverse of civil.Yet I thought her charming.If she was not pretty or polite, she was, I conceived, very picturesque; she reminded me of the female figures in certain Dutch paintings I had seen in other years at Seacombe Hall."
"我走进公共大厅。那儿也既大又高，而且生着炉火，很温暖。地板是黑色的，炉子是黑色的，大部分家具也都是黑色的；然而当我坐在一张又长又黑的桌子前（尽管桌子的一部分盖着白色的桌布），点好了早餐，开始从一个黑色小咖啡壶里倒出咖啡时，我感到了一种前所未有的自由的欣喜之情。炉子也许在某些人眼里看起来很沉闷，但是我不这么认为，它确实非常暖和，有两个绅士坐在它旁边用法语交谈着。虽然我不可能跟上他们那么快的语速，也听不懂他们所说的主旨，然而不管是法国人说的还是比利时人说的法语（那时我还没认识到比利时口音的可怕）对我来说都如同听音乐一般。其中有一位绅士立马认出我是英国人，毋庸置疑他是从我称呼侍者的方式上看出来的，因为我坚持用我拙劣的带有英国南方口音的法语说话，尽管这个人听得懂英语。这个绅士，看了我一两眼后，礼貌地用流利的英语跟我搭话。记得我当时向上帝许愿，但愿我也能说流利的法语；他那流利而标准的发音第一次使我有了这样应有的印象，我所在的首都是一个国际性的都市。这是我第一次见识到灵活使用语言的技能，后来我才发现这在布鲁塞尔很常见。","I repaired to the public room.That too was very large and very lofty, and warmed by a stove.The floor was black, and the stove was black, and most of the furniture was black; yet I never experienced a freer sense of exhilaration than when I sat down at a very long, black table (covered, however, in part by a white cloth), and having ordered breakfast, began to pour out my coffee from a little black coffee-pot.The stove might be dismal-looking to some eyes, not to mine, but it was indisputably very warm, and there were two gentlemen seated by it talking in French.Impossible to follow their rapid utterance, or comprehend much of the purport of what they said, yet French, in the mouths of Frenchmen or Belgians (I was not then sensible of the horrors of the Belgian accent), was as music to my ears.One of these gentlemen presently discerned me to be an Englishman, no doubt from the fashion in which I addressed the waiter, for I would persist in speaking French in my execrable South-of-England style, though the man understood English.The gentleman, after looking towards me once or twice, politely accosted me in very good English.I remember I wished to God that I could speak French as well; his fluency and correct pronunciation impressed me for the first time with a due notion of the cosmopolitan character of the capital I was in.It was my first experience of that skill in living languages I afterwards found to be so general in Brussels."
"我尽我所能地慢慢吃着早餐。早餐放在桌上，那个陌生人继续跟我说着话，那时我是个多么自由又独立的旅行者呀。但是最终桌上的东西被移走了。那两个绅士离开了房间。突然那个幻觉停止了；现实和工作又回来了。我这个刚刚从束缚中解脱的奴隶，在被束缚了二十一年之后自由了一个星期，便又必须要重新戴上依赖于他人的脚镣。我刚刚品尝到没有主人的甜头时，责任心就发出了严厉的指令：“向前走吧，另找一份工作。”我从不在痛苦而必要的任务上拖延，我从不将享乐置于工作之前。我的本性并不会这么做。尽管我发觉那天早晨天气很好，但要想在这个城市悠闲地散散步是不可能的，除非我首先呈递亨斯登先生的推荐信，然后找到正当的新出路。我从自由和欣喜中收回自己的心思，抓起我的帽子，强迫着自己离开某某宾馆，走上陌生的大街。","I lingered over my breakfast as long as I could.While it was there on the table, and while that stranger continued talking to me, I was a free, independent traveller.But at last the things were removed.The two gentlemen left the room.Suddenly the illusion ceased; reality and business came back.I, a bondsman just released from the yoke, freed for one week from twenty-one years of constraint, must, of necessity, resume the fetters of dependency.Hardly had I tasted the delight of being without a master when duty issued her stem mandate, ‘Go forth and seek another service.’ I never linger over a painful and necessary task, I never take pleasure before business.It is not in my nature to do so. Impossible to enjoy a leisurely walk over the city, though I perceived the morning was very fine, until I had first presented Mr. Hunsden’s letter of introduction, and got fairly on to the track of a new situation.Wrenching my mind from liberty and delight I seized my hat and forced my reluctant body out of the Hotel de- into the foreign street."
"那天晴空万里，但是我没有欣赏蔚蓝的天空以及我周围庄严宏伟的建筑。我的思想集中在一件事上——找到“布朗先生，门牌号——，国王大街”，因为信封上就是那么写的。通过询问我找到了。最终我站在了我要找的门前，敲了敲门，求见布朗先生，然后被带了进去。","It was a fine day, but I would not look at the blue sky or at the stately houses round me. My mind was bent on one thing—finding out ‘Mr. Brown, Numero-, Rue Royale,’ for so my letter was addressed.By dint of inquiry I succeeded.I stood at last at the desired door, knocked, asked for Mr. Brown, and was admitted."
"我被领进一间小的早餐间，见到了一位年长的绅士，十分严肃，一副公事公办的神情，很体面的样子。我奉上亨斯登先生的信。他很客气地接待了我。在简短的寒暄之后，他问我是不是有用上他建议或者经验的地方。我说“是的”，然后我接着跟他说我并不是一个到处旅游散心的有钱绅士，而是一个离职的账房职员，想找一份工作，而且想马上就能找到。他回答说作为亨斯登先生的朋友，他很乐意尽全力来帮我。他考虑了一会儿，便提出了两个地方：一个是列日的商行，另一个是卢万的一家书店。","Being shown into a small breakfast-room, I found myself in the presence of an elderly gentleman, very grave, businesslike, and respectable-looking.I presented Mr. Hunsden’s letter.He received me very civilly.After a little desultory conversation he asked me if there was anything in which his advice or experience could be of use.I said ‘Yes,’ and then proceeded to tell him that I was not a gentleman of fortune, travelling for pleasure, but an eX—counting-house clerk, who wanted employment of some kind, and that immediately too.He replied that as a friend of Mr. Hunsden’s he would be willing to assist me as well as he could.After some meditation he named a place in a mercantile house at Liege, and another in a bookseller’s shop at Louvain."
"“职员和店员！”我自言自语地低声说。“不。”我摇了摇头。我已经试过了那种高凳子；我讨厌它。我想会有其他更适合我的职位；此外，我也不想离开布鲁塞尔。","‘Clerk and shopman!’ murmured I to myself.‘No.’ I shook my head.I had tried the high stool; I hated it. I believed there were other occupations that would suit me better; besides, I did not wish to leave Brussels."
"“我不知道布鲁塞尔哪里要人，”布朗先生回答说，“除非你确实打算教书。我认识一所大型学校的校长，他需要一位教英语和拉丁语的教授。”","‘I know of no place in Brussels,’ answered Mr. Brown, ‘unless indeed you were disposed to turn your attention to teaching.I am acquainted with the director of a large establishment who is in want of a professor of English and Latin.’"
"我思考了两分钟，便急切地抓住了这个机会。","I thought two minutes; then I seized the idea eagerly."
"“这个很合适，先生！”我说。","‘The very thing, sir!’ said I."
"“但是，”他问，“你的法语程度足够教比利时学生英语了吗？”","‘But,’ asked he, ‘do you understand French well enough to teach Belgian boys English?’"
"所幸的是我能够肯定地回答这个问题。我跟一个法国人学过法语，我的法语虽然不是很流利但是足以听懂。我读得很好，也写得可以。","Fortunately I could answer this question in the affirmative.Having studied French under a Frenchman, I could speak the language intelligibly though not fluently.I could also read it well, and write it decently."
"“那样的话，”布朗先生说，”我想我能够许诺你这个职位，因为珀莱先生不会拒绝我所推荐的教授的，今天下午五点再过来一趟，我将把你介绍给他。”","‘Then,’ pursued Mr. Brown, ‘I think I can promise you the place, for Monsieur Pelet will not refuse a professor recommended by me; but come here again at five o’clock this afternoon, and I will introduce you to him.’"
"“教授”这个词让我有些担心。“我不是一个教授，”我说。","The word ‘professor’ struck me. ‘I am not a professor,’ said I."
"“哦，”布朗先生回答说，“在比利时，教授的意思是教师——就是这样。”","‘Oh,’ returned Mr. Brown, ‘professor here in Belgium means a teacher—that is all.’"
"我这才放心，我向布朗先生表示了感谢，便暂时离开了。这次我大步迈到街上，心里顿时轻松了；因为我为自己那天安排的任务已经完成了。我现在可以休息几个小时了。我自在地抬头看去。第一次注意到了闪烁的清新空气，天空中的一片湛蓝，还有那已粉刷或上过漆的房屋的清丽干净的外观；我发现国王大街十分美丽，便沿着它宽广的道路悠闲地散着步，继续观察着一家家富丽堂皇的宾馆，直到眼前出现了公园的栅栏、大门和树木，我的注意力被吸引了过去。记得在进公园之前，我站在那瞻仰了一会儿贝利亚尔将军的雕像，然后登上不远处一个的巨大阶梯的顶端，朝下面狭窄的后街看去，后来才知道那条街叫做迪萨贝尔街。我清楚地想起当时我的眼神停留在对面一个相当大的房子的绿门上，门上铜牌上印着“女子寄宿学校”！这个词在我的脑海中引起了不安；它似乎预示了某种约束。一些少女，无疑是走读生，那时正从门中涌出来。我想在她们中间找出一张秀美的脸蛋，但是她们戴得很紧的法国小软帽遮住了她们的容貌。不一会儿她们就都走了。","My conscience thus quieted, I thanked Mr. Brown, and, for the present, withdrew.This time I stepped out into the street with a relieved heart; the task I had imposed on myself for that day was executed.I might now take some hours of holiday.I felt free to look up.For the first time I remarked the sparkling clearness of the air, the deep blue of the sky, the gay, clean aspect of the whitewashed or painted houses; I saw what a fine street was the Rue Royale, and, walking leisurely along its broad pavement, I continued to survey its stately hotels, till the palisades, the gates, the trees of the park appearing in sight offered to my eye a new attraction.I remember, before entering the park, I stood a while to contemplate the statue of General Belliard, and then I advanced to the top of the great staircase just beyond, and I looked down into a narrow back street, which I afterwards learned was called the Rue d’ Isabelle.I well recollect that my eye rested on the green door of a rather large house opposite, where, on a brass plate, was inscribed, ‘Pensionnat de Demoiselles’ Pensionnat!The word excited an uneasy sensation in my mind; it seemed to speak of restraint.Some of the demoiselles, externats no doubt, were at that moment issuing from the door.I looked for a pretty face amongst them, but their close little French bonnets hid their features.In a moment they were gone."
"五点前我逛了布鲁塞尔的很多地方，但是整五点的时候我再次准时来到国王大街。我又被带进了布朗先生的早餐室，看见他像之前一样坐在桌边，他并不是一个人——还有个绅士站在壁炉旁边。两三句话的介绍就确定了他是我将来的主人。“克里姆斯沃斯先生，这位是珀莱先生；珀莱先生，这位是克里姆斯沃斯先生。”我们互相鞠躬，算是完成了这项介绍仪式。我不知道当时我鞠了个什么样的躬，我想应该是很普通的一躬，因为我当时心平如水，心境如常；根本没有当初见到爱德华·克里姆斯沃斯时的那种激动不安。珀莱先生的一躬则是极其有礼，然而并不做作，算不上法国式的。随后我们便面对面地坐下来。珀莱先生声音悦耳、低沉，考虑到我是外国人，他发音清楚而从容，他说他刚刚听“令人尊敬的布朗先生”介绍了我的学识和性格，消除了他一切有关于聘用我去他们学校当英语和拉丁语的教师是否适合的顾虑。但是按照惯例，他还是要问我几个问题来测试一下我的能力。他问过问题后，用一种让我高兴的语气表示对我的回答满意。然后提到了工资的问题。我们谈妥了，除食宿之外每年一千法郎。“此外，”珀莱先生建议说，“因为在我校工作期间你每天还有几个小时空闲时间，你可以适时地在其他学校兼职，这样可以利用空闲时间赚点钱。”","I had traversed a good deal of Brussels before five o’clock arrived, but punctually as that hour struck I was again in the Rue Royale.Readmitted to Mr. Brown’s breakfast-room, I found him, as before, seated at the table, and he was not alone—a gentleman stood by the hearth.Two words of introduction designated him as my future master.‘M. Pelet, Mr. Crimsworth; Mr. Crimsworth, M. Pelet.’ A bow—on each side finished the ceremony.I don’t know what sort of a bow I made—an ordinary one, I suppose, for I was in a tranquil, commonplace frame of mind; I felt none of the agitation which had troubled my first interview with Edward Crimsworth.M. Pelet’s bow was extremely polite, yet not theatrical, scarcely French.He and I were presently seated opposite to each other.In a pleasing voice, low, and, out of consideration to my foreign ears, very distinct and deliberate, M. Pelet intimated that he had just been receiving from ‘le respectable M. Brown’ an account of my attainments and character which relieved him from all scruple as to the propriety of engaging me as professor of English and Latin in his establishment.Nevertheless, for form’s sake, he would put a few questions to test my powers.He did, and expressed in flattering terms his satisfaction at my answers.The subject of salary next came on.It was fixed at one thousand francs per annum, besides board and lodging.‘And in addition,’ suggested M. Pelet, ‘as there will be some hours in each day during which your services will not he required in my establishment, you may, in time, obtain employment in other seminaries, and thus turn your vacant moments to profitable account.’"
"我认为这个建议很令人感激，事实上我后来发现珀莱先生给我的条件对于布鲁塞尔人而言是很优厚的，因为当时教师过多，薪资极低。我们又进一步商定我第二天就去上班，随后我便和珀莱先生分别了。","I thought this very kind, and indeed I found afterwards that the terms on which M. Pelet had engaged me were really liberal for Brussels, instruction being extremely cheap there on account of the number of teachers.It was further arranged that I should be installed in my new post the very next day, after which M. Pelet and I parted."
"哦，他长什么样子呢？我对他的印象又怎么样呢？他是个大约四十岁左右的男人，中等身高，十分削瘦，面色苍白，脸颊凹陷，眼窝很深，相貌端正，和颜悦色。那是一幅法国人的样貌（因为珀莱先生不是佛兰芒人，而是无论从出身还是血统来说都是法国人），尽管他仍带有高卢人那不可或缺的严厉，但其程度也被他那温和的蓝眼睛和那忧郁的、几乎是痛苦的表情减弱了；他的相貌文雅而充满智慧。我用了两个法语词是因为它们比任何英语词更能够描绘他脸上流露出的聪锐。总体来说，他是个有趣并有魅力的人。我只是担心他完全缺少一切他应有的职业禀性，甚至担心他不能成为一位足够严格而果决的校长。至少从外表看，珀莱先生与我的前任主人爱德华·克里姆斯沃斯形成鲜明对比。","Well, and what was he like, and what were my impressions concerning him?He was a man of about forty years of age, of middle size, and rather emaciated figure; his face was pale, his cheeks were sunk, and his eyes hollow; his features were pleasing and regular.They had a French turn (for M. Pelet was no Fleming, but a Frenchman both by birth and parentage), yet the degree of harshness inseparable from Gallic lineaments was in his case softened by a mild blue eye and a melancholy, almost suffering, expression of countenance; his physiognomy was fine et spirituelle.I use two French words because they define better than any English terms the species of intelligence with which his features were imbued.He was altogether an interesting and prepossessing personage.I wondered only at the utter absence of all the ordinary characteristics of his profession, and almost feared he could not be stern and resolute enough for a schoolmaster.Externally, at least, M. Pelet presented an absolute contrast to my late master, Edward Crimsworth."
"由于我先前对于珀莱先生的印象是彬彬有礼，第二天的情景真是令我大为吃惊。那天我到达新雇主那里，第一次看到了我未来的工作场所——也就是说，宽敞、高大、明亮的教室，我看到了很多学生——当然都是男孩——集合在那里，他们一起亮相，让我觉得这是一个人丁兴旺、欣欣向荣、纪律严明的学校。我在珀莱先生的陪同之下到各个班级走了一遍，所到之处鸦雀无声。如果恰巧有窃窃私语声，那位和蔼的老师只需用他那沉思的眼睛一瞥，便立刻安静下来。我想，这真令人震惊，如此温和的一瞥竟然这么有效果。当我巡视完教室的四周时，珀莱先生转过身来对我说：","Influenced by the impression I had received of his gentleness, I was a good deal surprised when, on arriving the next day at my new employer’s house, and being admitted to a first view of what was to be the sphere of my future labours—namely, the large, lofty, and well-lighted schoolrooms—I beheld a numerous assemblage of pupils, boys of course, whose collective appearance showed all the signs of a full, flourishing, and well disciplined seminary.As I traversed the classes in company with M. Pelet a profound silence reigned on all sides, and if by chance a murmur or a whisper arose, one glance from the pensive eye of this most gentle pedagogue stilled it instantly.It was astonishing, I thought, how so mild a check could prove so effectual.When I had perambulated the length and breadth of the classes, M. Pelet turned and said to me, —"
"“你介意就教这些男生们，测试一下他们的英语水平吗？”","‘Would you object to taking the boys as they are, and testing their proficiency in English?’"
"这个建议实在是出人意料。我本以为至少会给我一天准备；但是无论做什么职业，一开始就踌躇可不是什么好征兆，于是我走上我们身边的讲台，面对着我的学生们。我稳定了一下情绪，同时构思着该怎样用法语开场。我尽量简短地开场了——","The proposal was unexpected.I had thought I should have been allowed at least a day to prepare; but it is a bad omen to commence any career by hesitation, so I just stepped to the professor’s desk near which we stood and faced the circle of my pupils.I took a moment to collect my thoughts, and likewise to frame in French the sentence by which I proposed to open business.I made it as short as possible, —"
"“先生们，请拿出你们的阅读书。”","‘Messieurs, prenez vos livres de lecture.’"
"“先生，英语的还是法语的？”一个穿着宽松上衣，胖墩墩的圆脸佛兰芒学生问道。所幸的是这个回答很简单，","‘Anglais ou Français, monsieur?’ demanded a thickset, moonfaced young Flamand in a blouse.The answer was fortunately easy, —"
"“英语的。”","‘Anglais.’"
"我决定这节课尽量给自己少找麻烦。用我没有实践过的法语来讲解课文是不行的；我的口音和方言会一下子暴露出来，从而遭受面前这些年轻学生们的批评，我觉得对于他们我应该立即占据有利地位，所以我决定采取相应的行动。","I determined to give myself as little trouble as possible in this lesson.It would not do yet to trust my unpractised tongue with the delivery of explanations; my accent and idiom would be too open to the criticisms of the young gentlemen before me, relative to whom I felt already it would be necessary at once to take up an advantageous position, and I proceeded to employ means accordingly."
"当他们都拿出书来我喊道：“开始读！”圆脸的年轻人（后来我才知道他的名字叫朱尔·范德凯科夫）读了第一句。阅读书的名字叫做《韦克菲尔德牧师》，多用于外国学校里，因为据说它包含了对话英语中的很多典型句型。不过正如朱尔所说，也许它原本是用古代北欧文字写成的卷轴书，因为它的用词与大不列颠本地人的日常用语非常相似。哦，天哪！他鼻音极重，还读得直喘气！他的声音都憋在喉咙和鼻子里，因为这是佛兰芒人说话的方式；但是我听他把那一段读完，没有纠正一个词，而他倒是很洋洋自得，十分得意，无疑，他确信自己是个土生土长、地道的‘英国人’了。我就这样不露声色地听了十二个人朗读；当第十二个人口沫横飞、嘘嘘嘶嘶、含糊不清地读完时，我表情凝重地放下了课本。","‘Commencez!’ cried I, when they had all produced their books.Ale moon-faced youth (by name Jules Vanderkelkov, as I afterwards learned) took the first sentence.The livre de lecture was ‘The Vicar of Wakefield,’ much used in foreign schools, because it is supposed to contain prime samples of conversational English.It might, however, have been a Runic scroll for any resemblance the words, as enunciated by Jules, bore to the language in ordinary use amongst the natives of Great Britain.My God!how he did snuffle, snort, and wheeze!All he said was said in his throat and nose, for it is thus the Flamands speak; but I beard him to the end of his paragraph without proffering a word of correction, whereat he looked vastly self-complacent, convinced, no doubt, that he had acquitted himself like a real born and bred ‘Anglais.’ In the same unmoved silence I listened to a dozen in rotation; and when the twelfth had concluded with splutter, hiss, and mumble, I solemnly laid down the book."
"“停！”我说道。教室里顿时一片寂静，我用沉着而又有些严厉的眼神注视着他们。就算是一只狗被这样长时间狠狠地盯着也会表现出局促的，我的比利时学生最终也不安了。我观察到我面前的一些脸孔开始郁郁不乐，其他人则显得有些惭愧；我慢吞吞地握住双手，用低沉的声音喊道——","‘Arrêtez!!’ said I. There was a pause, during which I regarded them all with a steady and somewhat stern gaze.A dog, if stared at hard enough and long enough, will show symptoms of embarrassment, and so at length did my bench of Belgians.Perceiving that some of the faces before me were beginning to look sullen, and others ashamed, I slowly joined my hands, and ejaculated in a deep voix de poitrine,—"
"“太恐怖了！”","‘Comme c’est affreux!’"
"他们彼此看了看，撅嘴生气，面红耳赤，摇晃着脚后跟；我看出来他们都不高兴，但是他们被压住了，并且露出我所期待的神情。就这样煞了他们自满的气焰之后，下一步就要提升我在他们中的威信了——这不是一件特别简单的事，因为我担心暴露自己的弱点，在他们面前几乎不敢说话。","They looked at each other, pouted, coloured, swung their heels; they were not pleased, I saw, but they were impressed, and in the way I wished them to be. Having thus taken them down a peg in their self-conceit, the next step was to raise myself in their estimation—not a very easy thing, considering that I hardly dared to speak for fear of betraying my own deficiencies."
"“听着，先生们！”我说道，尽量在语调里加进一些强者的同情的腔调，这位强者对这帮无助的学生们的极差英语感到震惊，刚开始只是引起了他的鄙视，但最终他决定赐予帮助。然后我就从《韦克菲尔德牧师》最开始读起，用一种缓慢而清楚的声音，读了二十页，同时学生们都悄然无声地坐着，全神贯注地听着。当我读完时，差不多一个小时过去了。于是我站起来说——","‘Ecoutez, messieurs!’ said I, and I endeavoured to throw into my accents the compassionate tone of a superior being, who, touched by the extremity of the helplessness which at first only excited his scorn, deigns at length to bestow aid. I then began at the very beginning of ‘The Vicar of Wakefield,’ and read, in a slow, distinct voice, some twenty pages, they all the while sitting mute and listening with fixed attention.By the time I had done nearly an hour had elapsed.I then rose and said, —"
"“今天就先到这里了，先生们；明天你们再来读一遍，我期待你们做得更好。”","‘C’est assez pour aujourd’hui, messieurs; demain nous recommençerons, et j’espère que tout ira bien.’"
"说完这句深奥的话，我鞠了个躬，和珀莱先生一起离开了教室。","With this oracular sentence I bowed, and in company with M. Pelet quitted the schoolroom."
"“非常好！太好了！”当我们走进他的会客室时，校长便说道。“我刚看到先生很机灵，这使我很高兴，因为，在教学这一行，机灵和学识都是很重要的。”","‘C’est bien!c’est très bien!’ said my principal as we entered his parlour.‘Je vois que monsieur a de l’adresse; cela me plait, car, dans l’instruction, l’adresse fait tout autant que le savoir.’"
"出了会客室，珀莱先生带我去我的房间——我的卧室，那位先生用自鸣得意的口吻称呼着它。那是一间很小的房间，有一张极小的床，但是珀莱先生让我明白，能单独住一间已经是很大的安慰了。然而，尽管房间空间有限，却有两扇窗户。在比利时光线是不用纳税的，所以人们从不吝惜让光线照进他们的屋子。但是在这里，这一说法并不是十分贴切，因为其中一扇窗子已经用木板钉死。打开的窗户对着男生们的操场。我瞥了一眼那扇封死的窗子，想着如果拿掉木板那边会呈现出什么风景。我想珀莱先生从我的眼神中看出了我的心思，便做了一个解释。","From the parlour M. Pelet conducted me to my apartment—my chambre, as monsieur said with a certain air of complacency.It was a very small room, with an excessively small bed, but M. Pelet gave me to understand that I was to occupy it quite alone, which was of course a great comfort.Yet, though so limited in dimensions, it had two windows.Light not being taxed in Belgium, the people never grudge its admission into their houses.Just here, however, this observation is not very apropos, for one of these windows was boarded up. The open window looked into the boys’ playground.I glanced at the other, as wondering what aspect it would present if disencumbered of the boards.M. Pelet read, I suppose, the expression of my eye; he explained."
"“这扇封死的窗户对着一所女子寄宿学校宿舍的院子，”他说，“总之是那些强制性的礼教——所以，你可以理解——不是吗，先生？”","‘La fenêtre fermée donne sur un jardin appartenant à un pensionnat de demoiselles,’ said he, ‘et les convenances exigent—enfin, vous comprenez—n’est-ce pas, monsieur?’"
"我回答道：“是的，是的”。我当然要表现出十分满意的样子；但是当珀莱离开我的房间并随手关上门，我所做的第一件事就是仔细地察看被钉死的板子，希望能够发现某个我能将其扩大的裂缝或者裂隙，以便偷窥一下外面的圣地。我的探索是徒劳无功的，因为板子都被连接得严严实实，钉得十分结实。真是令人惊讶，我竟然感到很失望。我原想，要是能看到外面长满鲜花树木的花园该多美好啊，要是能看到少女们在外面玩耍该多有趣啊，我可以躲在薄棉窗帘后面研究着各个时期的女性性格了；然而，无疑是由于女校长手下的某一个老保姆无谓的顾虑，我现在只能看到铺着碎石的光秃秃的庭院，中间一条宽阔的道路以及男校平淡的围墙和窗户。不仅是那时，很久之后，尤其当我感到厌倦和情绪低落时，我就会不满地看着那个撩人的木板，渴望掀掉它，窥视一下外边我所想象的绿色区域。我知道有棵树紧挨着窗户长着，因为虽然现在没有树叶沙沙作响的声音，但是我经常能在晚上听到树枝拍动窗格的声音。白天我聚精会神地听，甚至能够隔着木板听见少女们嬉戏玩耍时发出的声音，老实说，我伤感的沉思偶尔会被这种其实并不悦耳反倒有些刺耳的声音所扰乱，那声音从下面看不见的乐园里传来，吵闹地闯入我的孤独。实话实说，对我来讲我确实说不清，究竟是勒泰小姐的女学生还是珀莱先生的男学生肺活量大；要是论及喊叫声，毫无疑问女学生是远胜过男学生的。我忘了提及，顺便说一下，勒泰就是那个用木板把我的窗子钉起来的老女士的名字。我说她老，当然是从她那小心翼翼的彷佛老保姆一样的举止判断的；此外，也没有人说过她年轻。我记得当我第一次听到她的教名时觉得非常有趣；她的教名是左蕾特——佐蕾德·勒泰小姐。不过大陆国家确实可以发挥奇思妙想取名字，我们严肃的英国人就从不会这么做。我觉得我们选名字的范围确实太狭窄了，以至于不好选。","‘Oui, oui,’ was my reply, and I looked of course quite satisfied; but when M. Pelet had retired and closed the door after him, the first thing I did was to scrutinize closely the nailed boards, hoping to find some chink or crevice which I might enlarge, and so get a peep at the consecrated ground.My researches were vain, for the boards were well joined and strongly nailed.It is astonishing how disappointed I felt.I thought it would have been so pleasant to have looked out upon a garden planted with flowers and trees, so amusing to have watched the demoiselles at their play, to have studied female character in a variety of phases, myself the while sheltered from view by a modest muslin curtain; whereas, owing doubtless to the absurd scruples of some old duenna of a directness, I had now only the option of looking at a bare gravelled court, with an enormous pas de géant in the middle and the monotonous walls and windows of a boys’ schoolhouse round.Not only then, but many a time after, especially in moments of weariness and low spirits, did I look with dissatisfied eyes on that most tantalizing board, longing to tear it away and get a glimpse of the green region which I imagined to be beyond.I knew a tree grew close up to the window, for though there were as yet no leaves to rustle, I often heard at night the tapping of branches against the panes.In the daytime, when I listened attentively, I could hear, even through the boards, the voices of the demoiselles in their hours of recreation, and, to speak the honest truth, my sentimental reflections were occasionally a trifle disarranged by the not quite silvery, in fact the too often brazen, sounds, which, rising from the unseen paradise below, penetrated clamorously into my solitude.Not to mince matters, it really seemed to me a doubtful case whether the lungs of Mdlle. Reuter’s girls or those of M. Pelet’s boys were the strongest; and when it came to shrieking, the girls indisputably beat the boys hollow.I forgot to say, by-the-bye, that Reuter was the name of the old lady who had had my window boarded up.I say old, for such I, of course, concluded her to be, judging from her cautious, chaperon-like proceedings; besides, no body ever spoke of her as young.I remember I was very much amused when I first heard her Christian name; it was ZoraÃ¯de—Mademoiselle ZoraÃ¯de Reuter.But the Continental nations do allow themselves vagaries in the choice of names such as we sober English never run into.I think, indeed, we have too limited a list to choose from."
"在这段期间，我面前的道路逐渐平坦起来。我在几个星期内，克服了几乎每个职业刚开始都会遇到的不可避免的、难以克服的重重困难。没过多久我的法语口语程度大大提高，可以跟学生从容交谈；由于我一开始便找到了对付学生的立足点，后来又继续紧握着我之前所取得的优势，所以他们从不敢尝试制造混乱。所有不同程度地熟知比利时学校情况的人，以及所有了解学校里师生间对立情况的人都会认为我这种情况是重要而不同寻常的先例。在结束这一章前，我想简短提一下我在班上所推行的方法。我的经验也许对其他人是有用处的。","Meantime my path was gradually growing smooth before me.I, in a few weeks, conquered the teasing difficulties inseparable from the commencement of almost every career.Ere long I had acquired as much facility in speaking French as set me at my ease with my pupils; and as I had encountered them on a right footing at the very beginning, and continued tenaciously to retain the advantage I had early gained, they never attempted mutiny, which circumstance all who are in any degree acquainted with the ongoings of Belgian schools, and who know the relation in which professors and pupils too frequently stand towards each other in those establishments, will consider an important and uncommon one. Before concluding this chapter I will say a word on the system I pursued with regard to my classes.My experience may possibly be of use to others."
"要弄清布拉邦年轻人的性格，并不需要敏锐的观察力，但是需要一定程度的因材施教的能力。他们的智力一般比较低下，兽性强烈；因此他们本性里既没有能力又没有活力。他们呆滞迟钝，又异常固执；重如铅，又像铅一样难以移动。鉴于这种情况，强求他们多动脑便显得很荒谬了。因为他们记忆力不好，头脑愚钝，反应迟钝，所以一旦遇到需要细致研究或者深思的问题他们就会因厌恶而畏缩。假如教师采取不恰当而武断的措施来强迫他们做让他们痛苦的事情，他们就会像绝望的猪一样固执地抵制，大声嚎叫；虽然说他们一个个都没什么胆量，但是若要一起闹起来那倒是绝不罢休的。","It did not require very keen observation to detect the character of the youth of Brabant, but it needed a certain degree of tact to adopt one’s measures to their capacity.Their intellectual faculties were generally weak, their animal propensities strong; thus there was at once an impotence and a kind of inert force in their natures.They were dull, but they were also singularly stubborn, heavy as lead, and, like lead, most difficult to move.Such being the case, it would have been truly absurd to exact from them much in the way of mental exertion.Having short memories, dense intelligence, feeble reflective powers, they recoiled with repugnance from any occupation that demanded close study or deep thought.Had the abhorred effort been extorted from them by injudicious and arbitrary measures on the part of the professor, they would have resisted as obstinately, as clamorously, as desperate swine; and, though not brave singly, they were relentless acting en masse."
"我了解到在我来珀莱先生学校之前，不止一位英语老师因为学生的联合反抗被解雇。所以只能要求那些没有天赋的学生稍稍动动脑子，并用尽各种可行的方法来帮助启迪他们迟钝而有限的理解力；要温和文雅、细致入微，甚至在某些方面做出不合理的违反常情的让步。但是，当达到纵容的底线时，你必须站稳脚跟，彻底扎根于岩石之中，就像圣加杜尔教堂的塔楼一样不可动摇。再向前一步——甚至是半步——你就会一头扎进愚钝的深渊。那样，你就会立即收到佛兰芒人式的感谢和慷慨，只不过是通过阵雨似的布拉邦人的唾沫和低地国家的大把污泥的方式。你应该尽最大限度地铲平求知路，移走每一块绊脚石，但是最后你必须坚持不懈地让学生们扶着你的手臂，让他们在你的指导下轻轻地沿着你所铺好的道路前进。当我把我的教学降至那些愚笨的学生所能接受的最低水平时，当我已经表现得最为谦和、最能容忍时，学生每一句鲁莽的话语，每一个违抗的举止，都会立即使我变成一个暴君。我只给他们提供一个选择，如果不低头认错就要被不光彩地开除。这个方法果然有效，我的威望逐渐在这一稳固的基础上确立起来。俗话说“三岁看老”；看着这些学生，回想起他们祖先的革命历史，我便想起了这句话。珀莱的学校仅仅只是比利时这个国家的一个缩影。","I understood that before my arrival in M. Pelet’s establishment the combined insubordination of the pupils had effected the dismissal of more than one English Master.It was necessary then to exact only the most moderate application from natures so little qualified to apply; to assist in every practical way understandings so opaque and contracted; to be ever gentle, considerate, yielding even, to a certain point, with dispositions so irrationally perverse.But, having reached that culminating point of indulgence, you must fix your foot, plant it, root it in rock, become immutable as the towers of St. Gudule.for a step—but half a step farther—and you would plunge headlong into the gulf of imbecility.There lodged, you would speedily receive proofs of Flemish gratitude and magnanimity in showers of Brabant saliva and handfuls of Low Country mud. You might smooth to the utmost the path of learning, remove every pebble from the track, but then you must finally insist with decision on the pupil taking your arm and allowing himself to be led quietly along the prepared road.When I had brought down my lesson to the lowest level of my dullest pupil’s capacity, when I had shown myself the mildest, the most tolerant of masters, a word of impertinence, a movement of disobedience, changed me at once into a despot.I offered them but one alternative—submission and acknowledgment of error, or ignominious expulsion.This system answered, and my influence, by degrees, became established on a firm basis.‘The boy is father to the man,’ it is said; and so I often thought when I looked at my boys and remembered the political history of their ancestors.Pelet’s school was merely an epitome of the Belgian nation."
"第九章","CHAPTER IX"
"珀莱先生当然不能反对勒泰小姐提出的建议，在他雇佣我的合同上有条款规定，如果有机会我可以接受额外的雇用。因此，第二天这件事便谈好了，我可以自由地到勒泰小姐的学校里授课，每周上四个下午的课。","M. Pelet could not, of course, object to the proposal made by Mdlle. Reuter, permission to accept such additional employment, should it offer, having formed an article of the terms on which he had engaged me. It was, therefore arranged in the course of next day that I should be at liberty to give lessons in Mdlle. Reuter’s establishment four afternoons in every week."
"那天晚上来临时，我准备过去跟小姐本人就此事商谈一下。之前我没有时间拜访她，因为我一整天都忙于班上的事。我现在还清楚地记得，离开住所之前，我做了一番思想斗争，想着是否应该将自己普通的衣着换成比较时髦一点的。最后我得出结论，这可能是在浪费精力。当时我想，“毫无疑问，她肯定是个拘谨的老处女，因为虽然是勒泰夫人的女儿，但是她很可能已经四十多岁了；除此之外，即使不是这样，如果她年轻又貌美，而我却不帅气，怎么打扮都于事无补，因此我还是就这样去吧。”于是我就这样出发了。经过梳妆台时，我好奇地侧身朝置于台上的镜子瞟了一眼自己。我看见的是一张消瘦而不端正的脸，又大又方的额头下面是一双凹陷的深色眼睛；面容缺乏生气和吸引力；虽然年轻，却没有活力——没有本钱去赢得女士的爱慕，也难成为丘比特的箭靶。","When evening came I prepared to step over, in order to seek a conference with mademoiselle herself on the subject.I had not had time to pay the visit before, having been all day closely occupied in class.I remember very well that before quitting my chamber I held a brief debate with myself as to whether I should change my ordinary attire for something smarter.At last I concluded it would be a waste of labour.‘Doubtless,’ thought I, ’she is some stiff old maid, for though the daughter of Madame Reuter, she may well number upwards of forty winters; besides, if it were otherwise, if she be both young and pretty, I am not handsome, and no dressing can make me so, therefore I’ll go as I am.’ And off I started, cursorily glancing sideways as I passed the toilet-table, surmounted by a looking-glass.A thin, irregular face I saw, with sunk, dark eyes under a large, square forehead; complexion destitute of bloom or attraction; something young, but not youthful—no object to win a lady’s love, no butt for the shafts of Cupid."
"不久我便到达寄宿学校的门口。我立即拉了下门铃；不一会门便开了，里面出现了一条由黑白大理石相间铺成的过道。墙壁也被刷成了仿大理石的图案，在遥远的尽头一道玻璃门敞开着，透过这道门我看见灌木丛和一块草坪，它们在春天傍晚那柔和的余晖下显得赏心悦目，因为现在已经是四月中旬了。","I was soon at the entrance of the pentionnat.In a moment I had pulled the bell; in another moment the door was opened, and within appeared a passage paved alternately with black and white marble.The walls were painted in imitation of marble also, and at the far end opened a glass door, through which I saw shrubs and a grass-plat, looking pleasant in the sunshine of the mild spring evening, for it was now the middle of April."
"这便是我对这个花园的第一印象；但是我没有时间继续环顾。女门房肯定地回答我女主人在家，随后推开左边一个房间的折叠门，带我进去后又重新关上门。我发现自己置身于一间客厅里，地板粉刷雅致，清漆极有光泽；椅子上和沙发上都罩着白罩布，还有一个绿瓷火炉，墙上挂着很多图画，镶在镀金的画框里，壁炉上放着镀金的座钟和其他装饰品，天花板的中央还挂着一个大型的闪着光吊灯，还有镜子、小桌子、棉布窗帘，客厅中间还摆着一张漂亮的桌子，这便是所有的家具。这一切看起来都极其整洁而华丽，但是如果不是因为有第二道敞开着的大折叠门，这里整体会给人一种冰冷的感觉。通过第二道折叠门可以看到另一间较小的客厅，装修更为舒适，让眼睛舒缓了一些。这间房间铺着地毯，里面有一架钢琴、一张沙发和一个小五斗柜；最重要的是，客厅里有一扇挂着深红色窗帘的大型窗户，窗帘没有拉上，透过被常春藤树叶和葡萄藤卷须盖起来的明亮的大玻璃，可以窥视整个花园。","This, then, was my first glimpse of the garden; but I had not time to look long.The portress, after having answered in the affirmative my question as to whether her mistress was at home, opened the folding-doors of a room to the left, and having ushered me in, closed them behind me.I found myself in a salon with a very well painted, highly varnished floor; chairs and sofas covered with white draperies, a green porcelain stove, walls hung with pictures in gilt frames, a gilt pendule and other ornaments on the mantelpiece, a large lustre pendent from the centre of the ceiling, mirrors, consoles, muslin curtains, and a handsome centre table completed the inventory of furniture.All looked extremely clean and glittering, but the general effect would have been somewhat chilling had not a second large pair of folding-doors, standing wide open, and disclosing another and smaller salon, more snugly furnished, offered some relief to the eye. This room was carpeted, and therein was a piano, a couch, a chiffonnière; above all, it contained a lofty window with a crimson curtain, which, being undrawn, afforded another glimpse of the garden through the large, clear panes, round which some leaves of ivy, some tendrils of vine were trained."
"“你是克里姆斯沃斯先生，是吗？”我身后传来问话声，我闻声不由地转过身来。由于我聚精会神地欣赏着这个漂亮小客厅，所以没有注意到有人进了这个大客厅。没错，那就是勒泰小姐。刚刚叫我的勒泰小姐就站在我的身后；我立即恢复沉着冷静，向她鞠躬致意——因为我不会轻易陷入窘境——然后便开始交谈起来，我评论着她这个小客厅的舒适之处，说她比珀莱先生多了一个花园，真是大有益处。","‘Monsieur Creemsvort, n’est ce pas?’ said a voice behind me; and, starting involuntarily, I turned.I had been so taken up with the contemplation of the pretty little salon that I had not noticed the entrance of a person into the larger room.It was, however, Mdlle. Reuter who now addressed me, and stood close beside me; and when I had bowed with instantaneously recovered sang-froid—for I am not easily embarrassed—I commenced the conversation by remarking on the pleasant aspect of her little cabinet, and the advantage she had over M. Pelet in possessing a garden."
"“是的，”她说道，她也常这么想，又补充道，“正是因为这个花园，先生，我才一直住在这里，否则我或许早就搬到一个更大并且更宽敞的住所去了；但是你知道，我不可能随身带着我的花园，在这个镇上的其他地方很难再找到这样一个又大又舒适的花园了。”","‘Yes,’ she said, she often thought so, and added, ‘It is my garden, monsieur, which makes me retain this house, otherwise I should probably have removed to larger and more commodious premises long since; but you see I could not take my garden with me, and I should scarcely find one so large and pleasant anywhere else in town.’"
"我对她的想法表示赞同。","I approved her judgment."
"“可是你还没看过我的花园呢，”她起身说道，“到窗户这边来，可以看得清楚些。”我跟着她走过去。她打开窗框，我探身向外望去，这个对我来说一直是个未知领域的花园，此时一览无遗。这是一片很长的耕地，并不开阔，中间有条小径，两边环绕着巨大的老果树。花园里有一块草坪，一个玫瑰花坛，一些由鲜花围成的边沿，远处是一片浓密的紫丁香、金链花和金合欢的小花丛。对我来说，它赏心悦目、美不胜收，因为我已经很久没有见过任何类型的花园了。但是我的目光并没有只停留在勒泰小姐的花园上；当我欣赏完那修剪整齐的花坛和正在发芽的小花丛后，我的目光转移到她本人身上，也没有匆忙收回。","‘But you have not seen it yet,’ said she, rising; ‘come to the window and take a better view.’ I followed her.She opened the sash, and leaning out I saw in full the enclosed demesne which had hitherto been to me an unknown region.It was a long, not very broad strip of cultured ground, with an alley bordered by enormous old fruit-trees down the middle.There was a sort of lawn, a parterre of rose-trees, some flower-borders, and, on the far side, a thickly-planted copse of lilacs, laburnums, and acacias.It looked pleasant to me, very pleasant, so long a time had elapsed since I had seen a garden of any sort.But it was not only on Mdlle. Reuter’s garden that my eyes dwelt; when I had taken a view of her well-trimmed beds and budding shrubberies, I allowed my glance to come back to herself, nor did I hastily withdraw it."
"我原以为我会看见一个身材瘦高，面色发黄的修女形象，身穿黑衣，头戴紧边白帽，帽带像修女的头饰一样绑在下巴下面；然而站在我面前的却是一个个头不高，颇为丰满的女人，也许实际上比我年龄大些，但是仍然年轻。我想，她不会超过二十七八岁。她像正统英国女人一样白皙。她没有戴帽子；头发是栗红色的，梳成一缕缕卷发；她的相貌并不算俊俏，也不算十分柔美，也不是非常端正，但是也绝不难看，而且我有理由认为她的五官表情丰富。她面容的首要特性是什么呢？是睿智？还是理智？是的，我想是这样的；但是我尚不能确定。然而我发现她的眼睛里带有某种宁静，面容里带有某种青春活力，看了令人极为喜悦。她脸颊红润，就像一个里外都熟透了的苹果。","I had thought to see a tall, meagre, yellow, conventual image in black, with a close white cap, bandaged under the chin like a nun’s head-gear; whereas there stood by me a little and roundly formed woman, who might indeed be older than I, but was still young.She could not, I thought, be more than six or seven and twenty.She was as fair as a fair Englishwoman.She had no cap; her hair was nut-brown, and she wore it in curls; pretty her features were not, nor very soft, nor very regular, but neither were they in any degree plain, and I already saw cause to deem them expressive.What was their predominant cast?Was it sagacity—sense?Yes, I thought so; but I could scarcely as yet be sure.I discovered, however that there was a certain serenity of eye and freshness of complexion most pleasing to behold.The colour on her cheek was like the bloom on a good apple, which is as sound at the core as it is red on the rind."
"勒泰小姐和我开始谈及正事。她说她对自己即将采取的步骤是否明智不敢绝对肯定，因为我很年轻，家长们可能会反对我这样的教师去教他们的女儿。“但是根据自己的判断行事一般都是好的，”她说，“我们要牵着家长走，而不是由他们领导我们走。一个教师是否合格并不取决于年龄；从我的见闻观察来看，我宁愿信任你而不信任音乐老师勒德吕先生，他是一个近五十的已婚男人。”","Mdlle. Reuter and I entered upon business.She said she was not absolutely certain of the wisdom of the step she was about to take, because I was so young, and parents might possibly object to a professor like me for their daughters.‘But it is often well to act on one’s own judgment,’ said she, ‘and to lead parents, rather than be led by them.The fitness of a professor is not a matter of age; and, from what I have heard, and from what I observe myself, I would much rather trust you than M. Ledru, the music-master, who is a married man of near fifty.’"
"我说我希望她会发现我值得她的褒奖；如果我了解我自己的话，我是不会辜负她对我的信任的。“虽然如此，”她说，“我还是会对你严加监督的。”之后她接着谈及薪水问题。她很慎重，戒备心强。她完全没有讨价还价，而是小心翼翼地试探着我的期望；我守口如瓶，不说出一个确定的数字，她就反复地劝导我，用一种流利但又婉转曲折的说法，最终商定每年五百法郎——这并不算太多，但是我同意了。谈判还没有结束时，天色已微暗。我倒是不急不忙，因为我喜欢坐在那里听她说话。她所展现的那种商务才能让我愉悦。爱德华也不会比她更注重实效，他还更粗暴、急躁；而且她又列出很多理由，解释颇多；最终她成功地使我相信她是个公正无私而且很慷慨大方的人。最后她不再讲了，她没什么可讲了，因为我默许了所有的一切，她没有必要再多解释什么。我只得起身告辞。我倒情愿再多坐一会儿。我回到我那空荡荡的小房间干什么呢？而且我看着勒泰小姐便觉得开心。尤其是现在，暮色使她的面貌柔和了一些，在这似明又暗的薄暮中，我可以想象她的额头已经舒展开来，嘴角上既带着甜美的微笑，又有着理智的线条。我起身离开时，故意伸出手，尽管我知道这有悖于国外的习惯。她微笑着，然后说道——","I remarked that I hoped she would find me worthy of her good opinion; that if I knew myself, I was incapable of betraying any confidence reposed in me.‘Du reste,’ said she, ‘the surveillance will he strictly attended to.’ And then she proceeded to discuss the subject of terms.She was very cautious, quite on her guard.She did not absolutely bargain, but she warily sounded me to find out what my expectations might be; and when she could not get me to name a sum, she reasoned and reasoned with a fluent yet quiet circumlocution of speech, and at last nailed me down to five hundred francs per annum—not too much, but I agreed.Before the negotiation was completed, it began to grow a little dusk.I did not hasten it, for I liked well enough to sit and hear her talk.I was amused with the sort of business talent she displayed.Edward could not have shown himself more practical, though he might have evinced more coarseness and urgency; and then she had so many reasons, so many explanations; and, after all, she succeeded in proving herself quite disinterested and even liberal.At last she concluded she could say no more, because, as I acquiesced in all things, there was no further ground for the exercise of her parts of speech.I was obliged to rise.I would rather have sat a little longer.What had I to return to but my small empty room?And my eyes had a pleasure in looking at Mdlle.Reuter, especially now, when the twilight softened her features a little, and, in the doubtful dusk, I could fancy her forehead as open as it was really elevated, her mouth touched with turns of sweetness as well as defined in lines of sense.When I rose to go, I held out my hand, on purpose, though I knew it was contrary to the etiquette of foreign habits.She smiled, and said,—"
"“啊！还真是典型的英国人呢，”她还是很友好地递过来她的手。","‘Ah!c’est comme tous les Anglais,’ but gave me her hand very kindly."
"“这是我们国家的特权，小姐，”我说，“并且请您记住，我将会一直这么做。”","‘It is the privilege of my country, mademoiselle,’ said I ‘and, remember, I shall always claim it.’"
"她笑了笑，十分温和，而且带着那种她一举一动都会表现出来的宁静——这种宁静格外地使我平静、满足，至少那天晚上我是这么想的。当我再次走上大街时，布鲁塞尔似乎成了一个让我非常愉快的地方，在那个完全一样的温和平静的四月之夜，前方似乎为我敞开了一条令人振奋、十分重要的光明前程。人是一种多么敏感的生物啊，至少在那段时间里我是这样。","She laughed a little, quite good-naturedly, and with the sort of tranquillity obvious in all she did—a tranquillity which soothed and suited me singularly, at least I thought so that evening.Brussels seemed a very pleasant place to me when I got out again into the street, and it appeared as if some cheerful, eventful, upward-tending career were even then opening to me, on that self-same mild, still April night.So impressionable a being is man, or at least such a man as I was in those days."
"第八章","CHAPTER VIII"
"那么珀莱先生本人呢？我后来还喜欢他吗？噢，极其喜欢！没有什么比他对我的态度更温和、更有风度、甚至更友好了。在他手下，我既不需要忍受冷酷的忽视和恼人的干涉，也没见过他有过自命不凡的优越感。但是，我恐怕学校那两位努力工作的贫穷的比利时招待对他不会有我这样的看法；对于他们，校长的态度总是那么冷淡、严峻、冷若冰霜。我相信有一两次他也发觉了，我对他对待我跟那两个人的不同态度有些吃惊，便带着平静而嘲讽的微笑解释说：","And Pelet himself?How did I continue to like him?Oh, extremely well!Nothing could be more smooth, gentlemanlike, and even friendly than his demeanour to me.I had to endure from him neither cold neglect, irritating interference, nor pretentious assumption of superiority.I fear, however, two poor, hard-worked Belgian ushers in the establishment could not have said as much; to them the director’s manner was invariably dry, stem, and cool.I believe he perceived once or twice that I was a little shocked at the difference he made between them and me, and accounted for it by saying, with a quiet, sarcastic smile,—"
"“只是两个佛兰芒人——无所谓！”","‘Ce ne sont que des Flamands—allez!’"
"然后他便轻轻地拿掉嘴上的香烟，向我们所坐房间的油漆地板上吐了口口水。他们确实是佛兰芒人，并且两个都带有真正佛兰芒人的特征，他们智力低下，并显示在外形中，没有人会看错。他们仍然是人，基本上都是老实人；我不懂，为什么别人就因为他们是那块贫瘠荒凉的土地上的原住民，就有借口用无止尽的刻薄和蔑视来对待他们。珀莱对我温文尔雅、和蔼可亲，这本会让我对他大有好感，可这种不公平的思想让我对他的好感多少有点减弱。一天的工作结束之后发现自己的雇主是个聪明而开朗的同伴，这当然是件愉快的事；虽然有时他显得有点尖酸刻薄，有时又有点阿谀奉承；虽然我发现他只是表面上温文尔雅，而实际上并非如此——虽然我偶尔察觉他温和的外表下实际上有着冷酷无情的一面——但我们都不是完美的；而且我早已厌倦了长期生活在X镇，那种暴虐横行、傲慢无礼的氛围了；所以在一个风平浪静的海港拔锚驻扎后，我现在可不想马上去窥探那些被小心翼翼地隐藏起来，仔细掩饰着不想让我察觉的缺点。我倒情愿认为珀莱是表里如一的，相信他是个仁慈而友好的人，除非有什么出乎意料的情况来表明他并非如此。他未婚，不久后我又发现他对于婚姻和女人完全是法国人的、巴黎人的观念。我怀疑他的道德观有些放纵，每当他提及自己所称的美丽女性时，语气中总带有一种冷淡和厌恶；但是他彬彬有礼，凡是我没有提及的话题他都不会涉及的。因为他十分聪明并且真正地喜欢谈有知识性的话题，我们总是有聊不完的话，绝不会陷入没话题的困境。我讨厌他提及爱情的方式。我从内心里憎恨逢场作戏、放浪形骸。他也感觉到我们两个的不同观念，于是我们都不约而同地避开有争议的话题。","And then he took his cigar gently from his lips and spat on the painted floor of the room in which we were sitting.Flamands certainly they were, and both had the true Flamand physiognomy, where intellectual inferiority is marked in lines none can mistake.Still they were men, and, in the main, honest men; and I could not see why their being aboriginals of the flat, dull soil should serve as a pretext for treating them with perpetual severity and contempt.This idea of injustice somewhat poisoned the pleasure I might otherwise have derived from Pelet’s soft affable manner to myself. Certainly it was agreeable, when the day’s work was over, to find one’s employer an intelligent and cheerful companion; and if he was sometimes a little sarcastic and sometimes a little too insinuating, and if I did discover that his mildness was more a matter of appearance than of reality—if I did occasionally suspect the existence of flint or steel under an external covering of velvet—still we are none of us perfect; and weary as I was of the atmosphere of brutality and insolence in which I had constantly lived at X—, I had no inclination now, on casting anchor in calmer regions, to institute at once a prying search after defects that were scrupulously withdrawn and carefully veiled from my view.I was willing to take Pelet for what he seemed, to believe him benevolent and friendly until some untoward event should prove him otherwise.He was not married, and I soon perceived he had all a Frenchman’s, all a Parisian’s, notions about matrimony and women.I suspected a degree of laxity in his code of morals, there was something so cold and blasé in his tone whenever he alluded to what he called le beau sexe; but he was too gentlemanlike to intrude topics I did not invite, and as he was really intelligent and really fond of intellectual subjects of discourse, he and I always found enough to talk about, without seeking themes in the mire.I hated his fashion of mentioning love.I abhorred from my soul mere licentiousness.He felt the difference of our notions, and, by mutual consent, we kept off ground debatable."
"珀莱的房屋和厨房都由他的母亲打理，她是一位真正的法国老太太。她曾经是个美貌的女人——至少她对我这样说过，我也尽力相信她的话；现在她却十分丑陋，丑陋到大陆的老妇人才会有的那么丑陋。不过也许是她的穿着方式使她看起来比实际上更丑陋。在室内时她会不带帽子到处走动，灰白的头发凌乱不堪；在家里时她很少穿长外衣——只穿一件破旧的棉背心。她也很少穿鞋，而是穿着一双大拖鞋，那鞋后脚跟都给踩烂了。可是，当她高兴出去逛逛时，比如星期天或者节日时，她就会穿上色彩艳丽、质地通常都很薄的衣服，戴上一顶装饰着花环的丝绸软帽，还披了一条很漂亮的披肩。总的来说，她并不是一个坏脾气的老妇人，而是一个啰嗦又爱随随便便说话的人。她主要是在厨房里外忙，似乎很想避开她那令人敬畏的儿子。的确，她对他显然有些畏惧。当他责骂她时，他的言辞既尖刻又严厉；但是他很少自找那种麻烦。","Pelet’s house was kept and his kitchen managed by his mother, a real old Frenchwoman.She had been handsome—at least she told me so, and I strove to believe her; she was now ugly, as only Continental old women can be. Perhaps, though, her style of dress made her look uglier than she really was.Indoors she would go about without cap, her gray hair strangely dishevelled; then, when at home, she seldom wore a gown—only a shabby cotton camisole.Shoes, too, were strangers to her feet, and in lieu of them she sported roomy slippers, trodden down at the heels.On the other hand, whenever it was her pleasure to appear abroad, as on Sundays and fête-days, she would put on some very brilliant-coloured dress, usually of thin teXture, a silk bonnet with a wreath of flowers, and a very fine shawl.She was not, in the main, an ill-natured old woman, but an incessant and most indiscreet talker.She kept chiefly in and about the kitchen, and seemed rather to avoid her son’s august presence.Of him, indeed, she evidently stood in awe. When he reproved her, his reproofs were bitter and unsparing; but he seldom gave himself that trouble."
"珀莱夫人有她自己的社交圈，有她固定的来访者，不过她的那些客人我倒是很少见，因为她一般在她所谓的密室里接待他们，那是个连着厨房、下一两级台阶才能进去的小房间。顺便说一下，我常看到珀莱夫人坐在那些台阶上，膝盖上放个木盘，一边吃着饭，一边跟她喜欢的仆人、女佣聊天，还一边责骂她的冤家——厨师，三不耽误。她从来不跟儿子一起吃正餐，事实上她也很少跟儿子一起吃任何饭。至于她在学生们的餐桌上露面那更是不可能了。这些细节在英国人听来真是匪夷所思，但是比利时不是英国，他们的习惯跟我们的不同。","Madame Pelet had her own society, her own circle of chosen visitors, whom, however, I seldom saw, as she generally entertained them in what she called her cabinet, a small den of a place adjoining the kitchen, and descending into it by one or two steps.On these steps, by-the-bye, I have not unfrequently seen Madame Pelet seated with a trencher on her knee, engaged in the three-fold employment of eating her dinner, gossiping with her favourite servant, the housemaid, and scolding her antagonist, the cook.She never dined, and seldom indeed took any meal with her son, and as to showing her face at the boys’ table, that was quite out of the question.These details will sound very odd in English ears, but Belgium is not England, and its ways are not our ways."
"考虑到珀莱夫人这样的生活习惯，有一天发生的一件事让我感到很吃惊，那是个星期四的晚上（星期四通常放半天假），当我一个人在房间里改大叠的英文和拉丁文练习时，一个佣人敲了敲门，门打开后，那个佣人向我转达了珀莱夫人的问候，并说如果我能去餐厅跟夫人吃茶点（在我们英国称之为“茶点”）的话，夫人将十分开心。","Madame Pelet’s habits of life, then, being taken into consideration, I was a good deal surprised when, one Thursday evening (Thursday was always a half-holiday), as I was sitting all alone in my apartment, correcting a huge pile of English and Latin exercises, a servant tapped at the door, and, on its being opened, presented Madame Pelet’s compliments, and she would be happy to see me to take my goûter (a meal which answers to our English ‘tea’) with her in the dining-room."
"“你说什么？”我说，因为我想我肯定是误解了，因为这个口信和邀请都太不同寻常了。佣人又重复了一遍同样的话。当然我接受了邀请；当我下楼时，我在想这个老太太葫芦里到底在卖什么药。她儿子出门了，到阿默尼大音乐厅或者别的某个他参加的俱乐部打发夜间时光去了。就在我的手刚抓住餐厅的门把时，一个奇怪的想法在我脑海中一闪而过。","‘Plaît-il?’ said I, for I thought I must have misunderstood, the message and invitation were so unusual.The same words were repeated.I accepted, of course; and as I descended the stairs, I wondered what whim had entered the old lady’s brain.Her son was out, gone to pass the evening at the salle of the Grande Harmonie, or some other club of which he was a member.Just as I laid my hand on the handle of the dining-room door a queer idea glanced across my mind."
"“她肯定不会是向我求爱吧。”我想。我曾听说过法国老太太喜欢干那种类型的无稽之事；而那个茶点又是怎么回事呢！我相信，她们通常是通过吃喝来开始那种事情的。","‘Surely she’s not going to make love to me,’ said I.‘I’ve heard of old Frenchwomen doing odd things in that line; and the goûter!They generally begin such affairs with eating and drinking, I believe.’"
"我这活跃的想象让我惊慌害怕起来，如果还有时间仔细考虑的话，我无疑会立即止步，奔回房间，将自己反锁在房间里；但是每当有一种危险或者恐惧被不确定性笼罩的话，大脑中的首要想法就是弄清楚真相，当可怕的预料成真时，便可以准备逃脱的应急手段了。我扭开门把手，马上跨过那致命的门槛，随手关上门，站在珀莱夫人的面前。","There was a fearful dismay in this suggestion of my excited imagination, and if I had allowed myself time to dwell upon it, I should no doubt have cut there and then, rushed back to my chamber, and bolted myself in; but whenever a danger or a horror is veiled with uncertainty, the primary wish of the mind is to ascertain first the naked truth, reserving the expedient of flight for the moment when its dread anticipation shall be realized.I turned the door-handle, and in an instant had crossed the fatal threshold, closed the door behind me and stood in the presence of Madame Pelet."
"我的上帝啊！第一眼看到她便似乎证实了我最担心的事情。她坐在那里，身穿浅绿色的棉布长袍，头戴一顶绣着花边的便帽，褶皱里还装饰着朵朵盛开的红色玫瑰。她的桌子上已经精心摆好食品。有水果、蛋糕、咖啡，还有一瓶我说不上名字的东西。我的额头已经开始冒冷汗，我已经回头瞟了一眼关好的门，当我眼睛四处打转看见炉边的大扶手椅上还坐了个人，我感到一种不可言状的安慰。那人也是女人，并且也是个老妇人，她体态丰满、面色红润，而珀莱夫人则是面黄肌瘦。她的打扮同样很华丽，春天里五彩缤纷的花朵把她的紫色天鹅绒帽子编织成一顶绚丽的花冠。","Gracious heavens!The first view of her seemed to confirm my worst apprehensions.There she sat, dressed out in a light green muslin gown, on her head a lace cap with flourishing red roses in the frill.Her table was carefully spread.There were fruit, cakes, and coffee, with a bottle of something—I did not know what.Already the cold sweat started on my brow already I glanced back over my shoulder at the closed door when, to my unspeakable relief, my eye, wandering wildly in the direction of the stove, rested upon a second figure, seated in a large fauteuil beside it. This was a woman, too, and, moreover, an old woman, and as fat and as rubicund as Madame Pelet was meagre and yellow.Her attire was likewise very fine, and spring flowers of different hues circled in a bright wreath the crown of her violet-coloured velvet bonnet."
"我只来得及大概观察一番，珀莱夫人就迈着她臆想的优雅而灵活的步伐走上前来跟我搭讪——","I had only time to make these general observations when Madame Pelet, coming forward with what she intended should be a graceful and elastic step, thus accosted me,—"
"“先生能应我这样一个微不足道的人的邀请丢下书本和学习，真是太赏脸了。先生能否再赏个脸，允许我向您介绍我亲爱的朋友勒泰夫人吗？她就住在隔壁——女子学校里。”","‘Monsieur is indeed most obliging to quit his books, his studies, at the request of an insignificant person like me.Will monsieur complete his kindness by allowing me to present him to my dear friend Madame Reuter, who resides in the neighbouring house—the young ladies’ school?’"
"“啊！”我想，“我就知道她很老。”我向她鞠了一躬后便就坐了。勒泰夫人坐在我的对面。","‘Ah!’ thought I, ‘I knew she was old.’ And I bowed and took my seat.Madame Reuter placed herself at the table opposite to me."
"“您觉得比利时怎么样啊，先生？”她操着极重的布鲁塞尔口音问我。现在我已经能够很好地区分优美纯正的巴黎人发音，比如说珀莱先生的发音，和喉音很重的佛兰芒人的发音了。我礼貌地回答了她的问题，暗自纳闷我面前这样一位粗俗而笨拙的老太太是怎么成为那所声誉极高的女子学校校长的。说真的，这里面肯定有问题。勒泰夫人看起来更像一位开朗快乐、自由自在的佛兰芒老妇人，甚至像一位小客栈的老板娘，而不像一位沉着、严肃而死板的寄宿学校女校长。一般来说，大陆国家的老妇人，至少是比利时人，对自己的举止，言行以及神态都无所顾忌，而我们英国庄严的老太太则对此嗤之以鼻，认为有失体面。从勒泰夫人的那张欢快的脸可以看出她同自己国家别的老妇没有什么两样。让我觉得实在奇怪的是她的左眼总是一眨一眨地斜瞟着，右眼习惯性地半睁着。我几次尝试弄清楚这两个古怪的老家伙邀请我来用茶点的动机，但都未成功，最终只好放弃了，听任它作为一个不解之谜，我坐在那里，先看看这个，再看看那个，同时还要尽情享用她们提供的充足的蜜饯、蛋糕和咖啡。她们也吃东西，但是没有什么极好的食欲；吃完一大半的食物之后，她们建议喝一小杯酒。我婉言谢绝了。珀莱夫人和勒泰夫人就没那么拘束；她们每人给自己调了一杯在我看来烈度相当高的鸡尾酒，放在炉子旁的一个台子上，为了方便起见，她们把椅子往那边拉了拉，并邀请我也拉过去。我照做了；我正好坐在她们中间，这样两人轮流跟我聊起来，先是珀莱夫人，接着又是勒泰夫人。","‘How do you like Belgium, monsieur?’ asked she, in an accent of the broadest Bruxellois.I could now well distinguish the difference between the fine and pure Parisian utterance of M. Pelet, for instance, and the guttural enunciation of the Flamands.I answered politely, and then wondered how so coarse and clumsy an old woman as the one before me should be at the head of a ladies’seminary, which I had always heard spoken of in terms of high commendation.in truth there was something to wonder at.Madame Reuter looked more like a joyous, free-living old Flemish fermière, or even a maîtresse d’auberge, than a staid, grave, rigid directrice de pensionnat.In general the Continental, or at least the Belgian, old women permit themselves a license of manners, speech, and aspect such as our venerable grand-dames would recoil from as absolutely disreputable and Madame Reuter’s jolly face bore evidence that she was no exception to the rule of her country.There was a twinkle and leer in her left eye; her right she kept habitually half shut, which I thought very odd indeed.After several vain attempts to comprehend the motives of these two droll old creatures for inviting me to join them at their goûter, I at last fairly gave it up, and resigning myself to inevitable mystification, I sat and looked first at one, then at the other, taking care meantime to do justice to the confitures, cakes, and coffee, with which they amply supplied me.They, too, ate, and that with no delicate appetite; and having demolished a large portion of the solids, they proposed a petit verre.I declined.Not so Mesdames Pelet and Reuter; each mixed herself what I thought rather a stiff tumbler of punch, and placing it on a stand near the stove, they drew up their chairs to that convenience, and invited me to do the same.I obeyed; and being seated fairly between them, I was thus addressed first by Madame Pelet, then by Madame Reuter."
"“我们现在谈正事吧，”珀莱夫人说，然后她便发表了她精心准备的演说，大概意思是她有幸邀请我来是为了给她朋友勒泰夫人一个机会，让她开口提出一项对我有很多益处的重要建议。","‘We will now speak of business,’ said Madame Pelet, and she went on to make an elaborate speech, which, being interpreted, was to the effect that she had asked for the pleasure of my company that evening in order to give her friend Madame Reuter an opportunity of broaching an important proposal, which might rum out greatly to my advantage."
"“要是你懂得这事能给你带来多少好处，”勒泰夫人说，“要我说，你像是个挺机灵的人。喝一点鸡尾酒吧（或者是奇尾酒，她是那么说的）；吃饱饭后喝点倒是一种适宜的有益于健康的饮料。”","‘Pourvu que vous soyez sage,’ said Madame Reuter, ‘et à vrai dire, vous en avez bien l’air.Take one drop of the punch (or ponche, as she pronounced it); it is an agreeable and wholesome beverage after a full meal.’"
"我鞠躬致谢，但还是谢绝了。她继续说道：“我觉得，”她严肃地抿了一小口后说，“我深深地感觉到我的爱女委托给我办的事十分重要；因为您知道，先生，掌管隔壁那所学校的是我的女儿吧？”","I bowed, but again declined it. She went on,—‘I feel,’ said she, after a solemn sip—‘I feel profoundly the importance of the commission with which my dear daughter has entrusted me; for you are aware, monsieur, that it is my daughter who directs the establishment in the next house?’"
"“啊！我还以为是您掌管呢，夫人。”尽管那么说，那时我确实回想起那所学校叫勒泰小姐寄宿学校，而不是勒泰夫人寄宿学校。","‘Ah!I thought it was yourself, madame.’ Though, indeed at that moment I recollected that it was called Mademoiselle, not Madame, Reuter’s pensionnat."
"“我！噢，不！我管理家务，看管仆人，就像我的朋友珀莱夫人为她的儿子所做的那样——别的都不干。啊！你还以为我在学校上课吧，是吗？”","‘I!Oh no!I manage the house and look after the servants, as my friend Madame Pelet does for monsieur her son—nothing more.Ah! you thought I gave lessons in class, did you?’"
"她大笑不止，似乎我的想法不可思议地激起了她的幻想。","And she laughed loud and long, as though the idea tickled her fancy amazingly."
"“夫人您不该笑的，”我说道。“如果您没有授课，我确定并不是因为您教不了。”说着我从口袋里抽出一方白手帕，抖开它，以法国式的优雅擦了擦鼻子，同时鞠了个躬。","‘Madame is in the wrong to laugh,’ I observed.‘If she does not give lessons, I am sure it is not because she cannot.’ And I whipped out a white pocket-handkerchief, and wafted it, with a French grace, past my nose, bowing at the same time."
"“多么讨人喜欢的年轻人呐！”珀莱夫人低声夸道，勒泰夫人并不那么富有情感，只是又笑了笑，因为她是佛兰芒人而不是法国人。","‘Quel charmant jeune homme!’ murmured Madame Pelet in a low voice, Madame Reuter, being less sentimental, as she was Flamand and not French, only laughed again."
"“我担心你是个危险人物，”她说。“如果你那么能恭维人，佐蕾德肯定会怕你；但是如果你是个好人，我将保守你的秘密，不告诉她你多么会阿谀奉承。现在，听听她给你提的建议吧。她听说你是位杰出的教师，而她又想为她的学校找到最好的教师（因为佐蕾德是个杰出的人，是个称职的女校长），所以今天下午她委托我过来一趟，向珀莱夫人打听是否能聘用你。佐蕾德是一位行事周密的将军，没有事先准备好她是不会鲁莽前行的。我想如果她知道我已经把她的意图透露给你她会不高兴的，她没让我说这么多，但是我认为向你透露这个秘密并没有什么坏处，珀莱夫人也是这个想法。不过小心点，你不要把我们出卖给佐蕾德——我的女儿，我的意思是说。她本人行事十分细心，且十分谨慎，无法理解为什么人们能从散播一些内幕消息中找到快乐。“","‘You are a dangerous person, I fear,’ said she.‘If you can forge compliments at that rate, Zoraïde will positively be afraid of you; but if you are good, I will keep your secret, and not tell her how well you can flatter.Now, listen what sort of a proposal she makes to you. She has heard that you are an excellent professor, and as she wishes to get the very best masters for her school (car Zoraïde fait tout comme une reine, c’est une veritable maitresse-femme), she has commissioned me to step over this afternoon, and sound Madame Pelet as to the possibility of engaging you.Zoraïde is a wary general; she never advances without first examining well her ground.I don’t think she would be pleased if she knew I had already disclosed her intentions to you. She did not order me to go so far, but I thought there would be no harm in letting you into the secret, and Madame Pelet was of the same opinion.Take care, however, you don’t betray either of us to Zoraïde—to my daughter, I mean.She is so discreet and circumspect herself, she cannot understand that one should find a pleasure in gossiping a little.’"
"“她跟我的儿子一模一样！”珀莱夫人喊道。","‘C’est absolument comme mon fils!’ cried Madame Pelet."
"“这个世界从我们的少女时代就全改变了！”另一个插嘴道。“现在的年轻人竟然都这样古板。但是我们还是闲话少说吧，先生。珀莱夫人会向她儿子提及你在我女儿学校上课的事，然后他会跟你说的；明天你就到我们家去，要求见见我女儿，你就跟她提这件事，像是先从珀莱先生那得知的，千万不要提我的名字，无论如何我都不想惹佐蕾德不高兴。","‘All the world is so changed since our girlhood!’ rejoined the other.‘Young people have such old heads now.—But to return, monsieur.Madame Pelet will mention the subject of your giving lessons in my daughter’s establishment to her son, and he will speak to you; and then to-morrow you will step over to our house, and ask to see my daughter, and you will introduce the subject as if the first intimation of it had reached you from M. Pelet himself, and be sure you never mention my name, for I would not displease Zoraïde on any account.’"
"“好的，好的！”我打断她，因为这些喋喋不休的累赘话开始让我很烦躁。“我会跟珀莱先生商量一下，事情会如您希望的那样被安排好的。晚安了，夫人们；我非常感谢您二位。”","‘Bien, bien!’ interrupted I, for all this chatter and circumlocution began to bore me very much.‘I will consult M. Pelet, and the thing shall be settled as you desire.Good-evening, mesdames; I am infinitely obliged to you.’"
"“什么！您要走了吗？”珀莱夫人惊叫道。","‘Comment!vous vous en allez déj E ’ eXclaimed Madame Pelet."
"“再吃些什么东西吧，先生；一个烤苹果，一些饼干，或者一杯咖啡如何？”","‘Prenez encore quelquechose, monsieur; une pomme cuite, des biscuits, encore une tasse de cafe?’"
"“谢谢，谢谢，夫人——再见了。”我最终离开了那栋房子。","‘Merci, merci, madame—an revoir.’ And I backed at last out of the apartment."
"回到自己的房间，我便自己在脑海里将晚上的事情顺了一遍。总而言之这件事很蹊跷，而且处理得很奇怪。两位老太太把整件事情搅合得有点错综复杂；但是，我心中对于这件事最主要的感觉倒是一种满足感。首先，在另一所学校授课是一种改变；其次教年轻的女学生们会是一件有趣的事情；被邀请去给寄宿学校的女学生们上课将是我人生中一种全新的体验。此外，当我瞥见那个被木板钉起来的窗户时，我心想，“现在起码我可以见到那个神秘的花园了。我将看到天使们和她们的伊甸园了。”","Having regained my own room, I set myself to turn over in my mind the incident of the evening.It seemed a queer affair altogether, and queerly managed.The two old women had made quite a little intricate mess of it; still, I found that the uppermost feeling in my mind on the subject was one of satisfaction.In the first place, it would be a change to give lessons in another seminary; and then to teach young ladies would be an occupation so interesting; to be admitted at all into a ladies’ boarding-school would be an incident so new in my life.Besides, thought I, as I glanced at the boarded window, ‘I shall now at last see the mysterious garden. I shall gaze both on the angels and their Eden.’"
"第十章","CHAPTER X"
"第二天上午我在珀莱先生家度过，时间似乎过得很慢。我恨不得快点到下午，那样我就能再去隔壁的寄宿学校，在那环境宜人的地方给学生上第一堂课，在我眼里，那地方真是太可爱了。中午时，午休时间到了；我们一点钟用餐。很快就到了上课的时间。终于，圣居迪勒教堂深沉的大钟缓缓敲响了下午两点的钟声，预示着我满心期待的时刻来临了。","Next day the morning hours seemed to pass very slowly at M. Pelet’s. I wanted the afternoon to come, that I might go again to the neighbouring pensionnat and give my first lesson within its pleasant precincts, for pleasant they appeared to me. At noon the hour of recreation arrived; at one o’clock we had lunch.This got on the time; and at last St. Gudule’s deep bell, tolling slowly two, marked the moment for which I had been waiting."
"就在那窄窄的后楼梯下面，我碰到了珀莱先生。","At the foot of the narrow back stairs that descended from my room I met M. Pelet."
"“你今天看上去真是神采奕奕啊！”他说，“我还从没见你这么开心过呢。什么事那么开心呢？”","‘Comme vous avez l’air rayonnant!’ said he. ‘Je ne vous ai jamais vu aussi gai.Que s’est-il donc passé?’"
"“还用说嘛，我太喜欢这些改变了。”我回答说。","‘Apparemment que j’aime les changements,’ replied I."
"“哦！明白了——原来是这样啊——不过我还是希望你明智一点儿。你年纪还小——还很年轻，相对你即将承担的责任，你得谨慎一点儿——明白吗？”","‘Ah!je comprends—c’est cela—soyez sage seulement.Vous ètes bien jeune—trop jeune pour le role que vous allez jouer; il faut prendre garde—savez-vous?’"
"“可是有什么该小心的呢？”","‘Mais quel danger y a-t-il?’"
"“我也说不好——不要给人留下深刻印象——就是这样吧。”","‘Je n’en sais rien—ne vous laissez pas aller à de vives impressions—violà tout.’"
"我笑了。一想到我可能会创造深刻的印象，一阵细微的喜悦感就会涌上心头。而正是那死气沉沉、单调乏味的日常琐事一直折磨着我。男子学院里那些身穿宽大外套的孩子从未在我心里激起过什么深刻印象，除了偶尔在我发怒的时候。我从珀莱先生面前冲过去，沿着走廊阔步走去，他的笑声随之从我身后传来——一种纯正的法式的、放荡的、嘲讽的笑声。","I laughed.A sentiment of exquisite pleasure played over my nerves at the thought that “vives impressions” were likely to be created.It was the deadness, the sameness of life’s daily ongoings that had hitherto been my bane.My blouse-clad élèves in the boys’ seminary never stirred in me any “vives impressions” , except it might be occasionally some of anger.I broke from M. Pelet, and as I strode down the passage he followed me with one of his laughs—a very French, rakish, mocking sound."
"我又一次站立在隔壁的门边，很快就又被请上那条让人心情愉快的通道，这通道四周是鸽灰色的仿大理石墙壁。我随着女仆走下台阶，转了个弯，发觉自己来到了一个类似走廊的地方。一个侧门开了，勒泰小姐那娇小丰满却不失优雅的身姿出现了。因为是大白天，所以我现在能看清她的衣着打扮。她穿着一件简单朴素的真丝长袍，长袍剪裁合适，将她那结实圆润的身形衬托得近乎完美；精致的小领子、绣着蕾丝的袖口和干净的巴黎风格短靴，将她的脖颈、手腕和双脚展现得美丽无比；可当她突然向我走近时，表情又是那么庄重！她的眼睛里和前额上都写着焦虑和忙碌。她看起来简直是严苛。“早安，先生。”她相当客气地问候我，却如此漠然、平淡，给我的深刻印象迎面甩来一条又冷又湿的毛巾。主人露面之后，女仆就转身离去了，我和勒泰小姐于走廊上并肩慢慢走着。","Again I stood at the neighbouring door, and soon was readmitted into the cheerful passage with its clear dove-colour imitation marble walls.I followed the portress, and descending a step, and making a turn, I found myself in a sort of corridor.A side door opened; Mdlle. Reuter’s little figure, as graceful as it was plump, appeared.I could now see her dress in full daylight.A neat, simple mousseline-laine gown fitted her compact round shape to perfection; delicate little collar and manchettes of lace, trim Parisian brodequins showed her neck, wrists, and feet to complete advantage; but how grave was her face as she came suddenly upon me!Solicitude and business were in her eye, on her forehead.She looked almost stern.Her ‘Bonjour, monsieur’ was quite polite, but so orderly, so commonplace, it spread directly a cool, damp towel over my vives impressions.The servant turned back when her mistress appeared, and I walked slowly along the corridor, side by side with Mdlle. Reuter."
"“先生今天要给一班授课，”她说，“教新课之前最好先来个听写或阅读，毕竟在外语教学中那些是最简单的形式；当然，第一次登台讲课感到紧张是在所难免的。”","‘Monsieur will give a lesson in the first class today,’ said she; ‘dictation or reading will perhaps be the best thing to begin with, for those are the easiest forms of communicating instruction in a foreign language; and at the first a master naturally feels a little unsettled.’"
"依我的经验来看，她说得很对。我只好沉默以示赞同。我们往前走着，都默默不语。走廊的尽头是一个又高又大的方形的大厅。从一边的玻璃门看进去，会发现里面有一个长长的、窄窄的餐厅，有几张桌子、一个橱柜和两盏灯。大厅什么也没有。正面那几扇大玻璃门向运动场和花园打开着；对面是一条宽大而弯曲盘旋的楼梯；大厅的其他两面墙上各有一扇巨大的折叠门，此时都紧闭着，毋庸置疑，通过那对折叠门就可以进到教室。","She was quite right, as I had found from experience.It only remained for me to acquiesce.We proceeded now in silence.The corridor terminated in a hall, large, lofty, and square.A glass door on one side showed within a long narrow refectory, with tables, an armoire, and two lamps.It was empty.Large glass doors in front opened on the playground and garden; a broad staircase ascended spirally on the opposite side; the remaining wall showed a pair of great folding doors, now closed, and admitting, doubtless, to the classes."
"勒泰小姐用余光瞥了我一下，或许是想确认我是否足够冷静，好被领进她那神秘的殿堂。我想，她应该觉得我的神情还算镇静，因为她已经推开了那扇门，我跟在她后面走了进去。迎接我们的是一阵沙沙的起立声。我并未左顾右盼，径直沿着两排桌凳之间的过道走上讲台，讲台有一个台阶那么高，上面有张孤零零的讲桌，我便坐在桌旁的空椅子上，这样就可以监视教室的一部分了，而另外一部分由坐在差不多高度的讲台上的女教师监视。讲台后面有一块可移动的隔板，可将这个教室和那边的教室隔开，隔板上连着一块漆得乌黑发亮的木制大黑板；讲桌上放着一支白色粗粉笔，以便老师将课文中出现的语法或语言难点写在黑板上进行讲解。粉笔旁边有一块湿海绵，可以擦去黑板上已经讲解过的字迹。","Mdlle. Reuter turned her eye laterally on me, to ascertain, probably, whether I was collected enough to be ushered into her sanctum sanctorum.I suppose she judged me to be in a tolerable state of self-government, for she opened the door, and I followed her through.A rustling sound of uprising greeted our entrance.Without looking to the right or left, I walked straight up the lane between two sets of benches and desks, and took possession of the empty chair and isolated desk raised on an estrade, of one step high, so as to command one division, the other division being under the surveillance of a maîtresse  similarly elevated.At the back of the estrade, and attached to a movable partition dividing this schoolroom from another beyond, was a large tableau of wood painted black and varnished; a thick crayon of white chalk lay on my desk, for the convenience of elucidating any grammatical or verbal obscurity which might occur in my lessons, by writing it upon the tableau; a wet sponge appeared beside the chalk, to enable me to efface the marks when they had served the purpose intended."
"我仔细并特意地做了这些观察才扫视了一遍坐在我眼前这些学生。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　我拿了支粉笔，回头看了下黑板，又摸了摸那块海绵，以确认湿度是否合适，此时，我发觉自己足可冷静地抬起头，从容地环顾四周。　","I carefully and deliberately made these observations before allowing myself to take one glance at the benches before me. Having handled the crayon, looked back at the tableau, fingered the sponge, in order to ascertain that it was in a right state of moisture, I found myself cool enough to admit of looking calmly up and gazing deliberately round me."
"我先是发现勒泰小姐已然溜走了，到处都见不到她的身影。只有一位女管事，或者是教师——就是坐在和我同样高度台子上?的那位——独自留在这里观察我的表现。她呆在一个光线稍微昏暗的地方，因为我眼睛近视，所以只能看见她那瘦骨嶙峋的身材和苍白的脸色。她坐着时，完全是一副无精打采、装腔作势的神态。","And first I observd that Mdlle. Reuter had already glided away; she was nowhere visible.A maîtresse, or teacher—the one who occupied the corresponding estrade to my own—alone remained to keep guard over me.She was a little in the shade, and with my short sight I could only see that she was of a thin bony figure and rather tallowy complexion, and that her attitude, as she sat, partook equally of listlessness and affectation."
"明亮的光线从宽大的玻璃窗射进来，我觉得更清晰、更显眼的还是坐在我眼前的学生们，她们中有些是十四、十五和十六岁的女孩子，有些则是十八（在我看来）到二十岁的少女。她们全都穿着最朴素的衣服，梳着最简单的发型；并且一个个都容貌姣好，脸色红润，笑逐颜开，大眼睛亮晶晶的，丰满的身材甚至显得有点结实。刚看过去我就忍受不了，就像禁欲主义者那样。我头昏目眩，眉眼低垂，用极低的声音嘟哝道——","More obvious, more prominent, shone on by the full light of the large window, were the occupants of the benches just before me, of whom some were girls of fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, some young women from eighteen (as it appeared to me) up to twenty.The most modest attire, the simplest fashion of wearing the hair, were apparent in all; and good features, ruddy, blooming complexions, large and brilliant eyes, forms full, even to solidity, seemed to abound.I did not bear the first view like a stoic.I was dazzled, my eyes fell, and in a voice somewhat too low I murmured,—"
"“小姐们，请把听写本拿出来。”","‘Prenez vos cahiers de dictée, mesdemoiselles.’"
"我命令珀莱先生的学生们把阅读课本拿出来时，语气可不这样。一阵沙沙声和拉开课桌的声音紧随其后，被掀起的课桌盖暂时挡住了一个个低下去掏练习本的脑袋，这时，我听见了她们的嘻笑声和低语声。","Not so had I bid the boys at Pelet’s take their reading-books.A rustle followed, and an opening of desks; behind the lifted lids which momentarily screened the heads bent down to search for exercise-books, I heard tittering and whispers."
"“厄拉利，我快笑抽了。”一个学生说。","‘Eulalie, je suis prête à pâmer de rire,’ observed one."
"“他讲话的时候脸可真红啊！”","‘Comme il a rougi en parlant!’"
"“是啊，这真是个缺乏经验的人。”","‘Oui, c’est un veritable blanc-bec.’"
"“别说了，奥尔唐斯，他听见了。”","‘Tais-toi, Hortense; il nous écoute.’"
"这时，课桌盖沉了下去，脑袋们重现了出来。我注意到三个窃窃私语的学生。在她们的脸庞消失了一会儿又重新出现的时候，我毫不顾忌地盯着她们看。她们几句不痛不痒的尖酸私语竟让我如此气愤，甚至让我鼓起勇气决心要治服她们。这太令人惊奇了。我觉得坐在面前的这些穿着黑长袍、梳着蓬松辫子像修女一般的年轻女孩们竟有几分天使的模样，连我自己也被这样的想法吓到了。刚才那低低的嗤笑和轻浮的私语，使我的头脑从那让人喜欢又感到压迫的幻想中得到了几分释放。","And now the lids sank and the heads reappeared.I had marked three, the whisperers, and I did not scruple to take a very steady look at them as they emerged from their temporary eclipse.It is astonishing what case and courage their little phrases of flippancy had given me.The idea by which I had been awed was that the youthful beings before me, with their dark nun-like robes and softly-braided hair, were a kind of half-angels.The light titter, the giddy whisper, had already in some measure relieved my mind of that fond and oppressive fancy."
"我说的那三个学生就坐在前排，离讲台不到半码远的位置，她们可算是班上最具女性美的几位了。我是后来才知道她们的名字的，现在不妨提一下；她们是厄拉利、奥尔唐斯和卡罗琳。厄拉利是一个身材高挑，身形曼妙的女生。肌白如雪，容貌堪比这个低地国家的圣母玛利亚。跟我见过的荷兰画家笔下的许多少女画像十分相似。她的身材或脸上没有一丝棱角——非常圆润光滑；不管思考也好，哀伤也罢，亦或是生气和害羞，她的肤色总是那样白皙，那样剔透。丰满的胸脯随着均匀的呼吸高低起伏着，眼睛微微转动。只凭着这些生命的迹象，我就能分辨出她们并不是什么漂亮的人物蜡像，而是真真实实的人。奥尔唐斯中等个子，身材肥胖。她体形并不优雅，但脸庞却很迷人，比厄拉利的还要富有朝气和活力；一头深褐色的头发，脸上的表情也复杂多样。她的眼眼里透着一钟古灵精怪的淘气样。她或许还很坚毅、理智，但这些从她的相貌上完全看不出来。","The three I allude to were just in front, within half a yard of my estrade, and were among the most womanly-looking present.Their names I knew afterwards, and may as well mention now; they were Eulalie, Hortense, Caroline.Eulalie was tall, and very finely shaped.She was fair, and her features were those of a Low Country Madonna.Many a figure de Vierge have I seen in Dutch pictures exactly resembling hers.There were no angles in her shape or in her face—all was curve and roundness; neither thought, sentiment, nor passion disturbed by line or flush the equality of her pale, clear skin.Her noble bust heaved with her regular breathing, her eyes moved a little.By these evidences of life alone could I have distinguished her from some large handsome figure moulded in wax.Hortense was of middle size, and stout.Her form was ungraceful, her face striking, more alive and brilliant than Eulalie’s; her hair was dark brown, her complexion richly coloured.there were frolic and mischief in her eye.Consistency and good sense she might possess, but none of her features betokened those qualities."
"卡罗琳显然已经发育成熟，但是身材却有点娇小。她的头发乌黑亮丽，双眼深邃幽黑，神情端庄无比，脸色是苍白的橄榄色，肌肤晶莹剔透，颈部周围也洁白如洗。在很多人眼里，这一切组合成了一个完美无瑕的美人。真不知道，她那苍白的皮肤和端庄的神情，怎么能引起人们感官欲望。我觉得那种感官欲望定然来自她的嘴唇和眼睛，所有见过她的人都无法否认她的魅力。现在她就已经如此性感，十年以后，肯定变得粗俗不堪，将来也一定会做不少傻事，这一点很明显地写在她脸上。","Caroline was little, though evidently full-grown.Raven-black hair, very dark eyes, absolutely regular features, with a colourless olive complexion, clear as to the face and sallow about the neck, formed in her that assemblage of points whose union many persons regard as the perfection of beauty.How, with the tintless pallor of her skin and the classic straightness of her lineaments, she managed to look sensual, I don’t know.I think her lips and eyes contrived the affair between them, and the result left no uncertainty on the beholder’s mind.She was sensual now, and in ten years’ time she would be coarse, promise plain was written in her face of much future folly."
"如果说在看这些女孩们的时候我的眼神是毫无顾忌的，那么，她们的眼神可以说是近乎放肆了。厄拉利目不转睛地盯着我，看似被动，实是自信地等着我为她那高贵的魅力即兴赞叹一番。奥尔唐斯一边放肆地注视着我，一边咯咯地笑着。突然，她莽撞地对我说：","If I looked at these girls with little scruple, they looked at me with still less.Eulalie raised her unmoved eye to mine, and seemed to expect, passively but securely, an impromptu tribute to her majestic charms.Hortense regarded me boldly, and giggled at the same time, while she said, with an air of impudent freedom,—"
"“先生，先给我们做点简单的听写吧。”","‘Dictez-nous quelque chose de facile pour commencer, monsieur.’"
"卡罗琳甩了甩头，将遮在她那双黝黑滚圆的眼睛上的蓬松浓密又略显粗糙的卷发甩到一边。她的嘴巴张得像一个逃亡的黑奴的嘴巴那么大，两排整齐、洁白的牙齿显露无遗；接着，她向我投来了一个含情脉脉的微笑。就如同波利娜·伯吉斯那样美，却不如柳克丽丝·德波吉亚纯洁。卡罗琳出生贵族家庭。在我后来听闻她那贵族母亲的个性之后，我也就丝毫不讶异于她的早熟了。从我看到她们的第一眼开始，我就知道，这三位小姐肯定认为自己是学校的皇后，自己的魅力定能使其他同学黯然无光。还不到五分钟，她们就将自己的性格暴露在我眼前，在不到五分钟的时间里，我就横下心来决定用强硬的手腕让她们屈服于我。","Caroline shook her loose ringlets of abundant but somewhat coarse hair over her rolling black eyes.parting her lips, as full as those of a hot-blooded Maroon, she showed her- well-set teeth sparkling between them, and treated me at the same time to a smile de sa façon.Beautiful as Pauline Borghese, she looked at the moment scarcely purer than Lucrèce de Borgia.Caroline was of noble family.I heard her lady-mother’s character afterwards, and then I ceased to wonder at the precocious accomplishments of the daughter.These three, I at once saw, deemed themselves the queens of the school, and conceived that by their splendour they threw all the rest into the shade.In less than five minutes they had thus revealed to me their characters, and in less than five minutes I had buckled on a breast-plate of steely indifference, and let down a visor of impassable austerity."
"“拿起笔来开始听写，”我用一种冷漠而平淡的语气说道，就像跟朱尔·范德凯科夫那伙人讲话一样。","‘Take your pens and commence writing,’ said I, in as dry and trite a voice as if I had been addressing only Jules Vanderkelkov and Co."
"听写开始了。那三位美丽的女孩不停地打断我，尽是问些愚蠢的问题或说些没用的话；对有些问题，我默而不答，而另一些问题，也只是小声简洁地应付过去。","The dictée now commenced.My three belles interrupted me perpetually with little silly questions and uncalled-for remarks, to some of which I made no answer, and to others replied very quietly and briefly."
"“先生，英文里面有个句号加一个逗号用英语怎么说来着？”","‘Comment dit-on point et virgule en anglais, monsieur?’"
"“是分号，小姐。”","‘Semi-colon, mademoiselle.’"
"“分号?啊，真是太好笑了！”（咯咯的笑声。）","‘Semi-collong?Ah, comme c‘est drôle!’ (Giggle.)"
"“我的笔真是太难用——简直没办法写了！”","‘J’ai une si mauvaise plume—impossible d’écrire!’"
"“可是，先生——我跟不上您的节奏——您念得太快了。”","‘Mais, monsieur—je ne sais pas suivre—vous allez si vite.’"
"“我怎么一点也没听懂！”","‘Je n’ai rien compris, moi!’"
"这时班里响起一阵嗡嗡声，那位教师第一次开了口，喊道——","Here a general murmur arose, and the teacher, opening her lips for the first time, ejaculated,—"
"“小姐们，请安静！”","‘Silence, mesdemoiselles!’"
"安静并没有到来。反而，前排的那三位小姐说得更大声了。","No silence followed; on the contrary, the three ladies in front began to talk more loudly."
"“学英语真是太难了！”","‘C’est si difficile, l’anglais!’"
"“我讨厌听写。”","‘Je déteste la dictée.’"
"“净是听写这些不懂的东西，真讨厌！”","‘Quel ennui d’écrire quelque chose quc l’on ne comprend pas!’"
"坐在后排的几名学生笑了起来。混乱开始弥漫于教室。现在我必须采取些及时的措施了。","Some of those behind laughed.A degree of confusion began to pervade the class.It was necessary to take prompt measures."
"“把练习本拿给我，”我对厄拉利说道，语气相当严厉，在她还没有来得及递给我前，我就俯下身抓起她的本子。","‘Donnez-moi votre cahier,’ said I to Eulalie in an abrupt tone; and bending over, I took it before she had time to give it."
"“还有你，小姐，把你的也拿给我，”随后，我又对坐在第一排的另一边的一位脸色苍白、相貌平平的姑娘说，语气比刚才缓和多了，我立刻就发现，她的外表是班上最丑陋的，上课却是最专心的。她起身走近我，大方而恭敬地行了一个屈膝礼后把练习本递给了我。我迅速地扫视了一下两人的听写。厄拉利的字模糊难辨，本子上也墨迹斑斑，满是粗心而犯的错误；西尔维（就是那个丑女孩的名字）则写得工工整整，没有一点不合情理的错误，只有些拼写错误。我镇定地大声地宣读了这两份听写练习，指出了其中的错误，然后，看着厄拉利。","‘Et vous, mademoiselle; donnez-moi le votre,’ continued I, more mildly, addressing a little pale, plain-looking girl, who sat in the first row of the other division, and whom I had remarked as being at once the ugliest and the most attentive in the room.She rose up, walked over to me, and delivered her book with a grave, modest curtsy.I glanced over the two dictations.Eulalie’s was slurred, blotted, and full of silly mistakes; Sylvie’s (such was the name of the ugly little girl) was clearly written, it contained no error against sense, and but few faults of orthography.I coolly read aloud both exercises, marking the faults; then I looked at Eulalie."
"“真是丢人！”我说完便故意把她的本子撕成四片并将碎片扔给她，然后微笑着把练习本还给西尔薇，对她说——","‘C’est honteux!’ said I, and I deliberately tore her dictation in four parts, and presented her with the fragments I returned Sylvie her book with a smile, saying,—"
"“很好，我真为你感到骄傲。”","‘C’est bien; je suis content de vous.’"
"西尔维看似镇定而开心。而厄拉利却鼓鼓得像只被斗得发怒的火鸡。不过她没有发作。第一排学生刚才那种自负和轻佻的神气不见了，取而代之的是默不作声和闷闷不乐。这种情形于我非常有利，接下来的课就会不受任何干扰地顺利进行了。","Sylvie looked calmly pleased.Eulalie swelled like an incensed turkey.But the mutiny was quelled.The conceited coquetry and futile flirtation of the first bench were exchanged for a taciturn sullenness, much more convenient to me, and the rest of my lesson passed without interruption."
"这时，院子里钟声叮当，宣布是下课的时间了。我也听到了我们自己的钟声，随即，某一所公立大学的钟声也跟着响起来。教室的秩序瞬间消失。每个学生都站了起来。我急忙抓起我的帽子，向那位女老师点头致意了一下，赶在里面一帮学生蜂拥而出的高潮前，离开了教室；据我所知，里面还有大约一百名学生，我已经听到了她们起立时的嘈杂声。","A bell clanging out in the yard announced the moment for the cessation of school labours.I heard our own bell at the same time, and that of a certain public college immediately after.Order dissolved instantly.Up started every pupil.I hastened to seize my hat, bow to the maîtresse, and quit the room before the tide of externats should pour from the inner class, where I knew near a hundred were prisoned, and whose rising tumult I already heard."
"我刚穿过大厅，来到走廊上，恰好勒泰小姐再次向我迎了上来。","I had scarcely crossed the hall and gained the corridor when Mdlle. Reuter came again upon me."
"“到这儿来坐会儿吧。”她说着打开走廊一侧房间的房门，刚才她就是从那里出来的。从那个精致的玻璃柜可以看出这是一个餐厅，玻璃柜里满是杯子和瓷器，构成了餐厅家具的一部分。我们刚一走进房间关上门，走读生们就把整个走廊挤得水泄不通，扯取着挂在木制衣架上的的斗篷、帽子和手提包。隔一段时间，就能听见一位女管事大声呵斥，竭尽全力地想要维持秩序，却无济于事。我也觉得这没有用。这帮粗野的学生根本不知道什么是纪律，亏得这所学校还被认为是布鲁塞尔管理最好的学校之一。","‘Step in here a moment,’ said she, and she held open the door of the side room from whence she had issued on my arrival.It was a salle-Emanger, as appeared from the beaufet, and the armoire vitrée, filled with glass and china, which formed part of its furniture.Ere she had closed the door on me and herself, the corridor was already filled with day-pupils, tearing down their cloaks, bonnets, and cabas from the wooden pegs on which they were suspended.The shrill voice of a maîtresse was heard at intervals, vainly endeavouring to enforce some sort of order—vainly, I say. Discipline there was none in these rough ranks, and yet this was considered one of the best conducted schools in Brussels."
"“好了，你的第一堂课结束了。”勒泰小姐用极其镇静平淡的预期开口说道。虽然我上课的教室和她的房间仅仅隔着一堵墙，但她却好像对刚才的混乱毫不知情一样。","‘Well, you have given your first lesson,’ began Mdlle. Reuter in the most calm, equable voice, as though quite unconscious of the chaos from which we were separated only by a single wall."
"“你满意学生的表现吗？或者说她们有没有任何行为使你恼怒？不必对我有丝毫隐瞒，请你完全相信我。”","‘Were you satisfied with your pupils, or did any circumstance in their conduct give you cause for complaint?Conceal nothing from me; repose in me entire confidence.’"
"很高兴的是，我觉得我完全有能力管理好我的学生，无需任何人的帮助。一开始，学校里那种魅力，那种金色的光晕，让我有坠入迷雾的感觉，现在这都已经大大地消散了。我不能说女子寄宿学校的现实与之前那种模糊的想像有差别会让我感到心烦或丧气。我只是觉得受到了启发，被人逗乐了，所以，我觉得我没有任何理由向勒泰小姐抱怨，对于她的关心和信任，我抱以微笑。","Happily, I felt in myself complete power to manage my pupils without aid. The enchantment, the golden haze which had dazzled my perspicuity at first, had been a good deal dissipated.I cannot say I was chagrined or downcast by the contrast which the reality of a pensionnat de demoiselles presented to my vague ideal of the same community.I was only enlightened and amused; consequently, I felt in no disposition to complain to Mdlle. Reuter, and I received her considerate invitation to confidence with a smile."
"“非常感谢，小姐；一切都进展得很顺利。”","‘A thousand thanks, mademoiselle; all has gone very smoothly.’"
"她看上去更多的是怀疑。","She looked more than doubtful."
"“那么第一排那三个女孩呢？”她说。","‘Et les trois demoiselles du premier bane?’ said she."
"“啊！一切都会好起来的！”我回答道。勒泰小姐不再问我问题了。但她的眼睛——不大、不亮、不动人、也不愠怒，却充满狡黠、敏锐和实在的眼睛——显出一丝怀疑的神色。她的眼睛瞬间闪现出一道光芒，好像在说：“随你怎么守口如瓶吧，我并不指望你坦白。你想要隐瞒的事，我早就知道了。”","‘Ah!tout va an mieux!’ was my answer, and Mdlle. Reuter ceased to question me; but her eye—not large, not brilliant, not melting, or kindling, but astute, penetrating, practical—showed she was even with me.It let out a momentary gleam, which said plainly, ‘Be as close as you like; I am not dependent on your candour.What you would conceal I already know.’"
"经过一番平静、不露痕迹的过渡之后，女校长的态度转变了。那种焦急关切的表情不见了，她开始聊起了天气和小镇，天南地北地侃起来，并客套式地问候起珀莱先生和珀莱夫人。我一一回答了她的所有问题。她一直拖延着谈话的时间，我也只好应和着。她坐了很久，谈了很多，并不时地转换话题；很显然，她这样纠缠我是有特别目的的。单凭她的谈话看不出来究竟，但从她的表情里我找到了一些线索，她的话不过都是些客套之语，眼睛却时不时地盯着我的脸看。她并不是正视着我，而是斜看过来，目光如此娴静和诡秘，但没有一次能过逃过我的眼睛。她急切地观察着我，我对她也毫不放松。很快我便发觉，她是在观察我的真实个性。她在探寻我性格中坚强、脆弱以及怪异之处。她一下用这种方法测试我，一下又用那种方法考验我，希望能够找到一条裂缝，一个漏洞，好趁机插足，将她有力的小脚踏在我的脖子上，成为主宰我天性的女主人。读者们，不要误解我的意思，她并非想在爱情上赢得优势，她那时渴望的只是政治家的权力。如今，我在她的学校里当了老师，她想知道她的智力在哪方面胜过我，她要用什么感情、什么方法才能领导我。","By a transition so quiet as to be scarcely perceptible, the directress’s manner changed.The anxious business air passed from her face, and she began chatting about the weather and the town, and asking in neighbourly wise after M. and Madame Pelet.I answered all her little questions.She prolonged her talk; I went on following its many little windings.She sat so long, said so much, varied so often the topics of discourse, that it was not difficult to perceive she had a particular aim in thus detaining me. Her mere words could have afforded no clue to this aim, but her countenance aided, while her lips uttered only affable commonplaces, her eyes reverted continually to my face.Her glances were not given in full, but out of the corners, so quietly, so stealthily, yet I think I lost not one.  I watched her as keenly as she watched me.I perceived soon that she was feeling after my real character.She was searching for salient points, and weak points, and eccentric points.She was applying now this test, now that, hoping in the end to find some chink, some niche where she could put in her little firm foot and stand upon my neck, mistress of my nature.Do not mistake me, reader—it was no amorous influence she wished to gain; at that time it was only the power of the politician to which she aspired.I was now installed as a professor in her establishment, and she wanted to know where her mind was superior to mine, by what feeling or opinion she could lead me."
"我很享受这样的游戏，并不急着结束。有时，我给她一点的希望，说话语气就故意松软一点；等她以为自己占了上风，那敏锐的目光就变得明亮起来。引诱她一会后，我便沾沾自喜地突然改变语气，用精明、有力的语气结束一番对话；这时，她的脸又拉了下来。最后，一个仆人进来通知用餐。我们不得不结束这场心理战；到分开时，也没得出个胜负。即使勒泰小姐没有给我任何机会对她进行情感攻势，我也成功地拆穿她的一个个小阴谋。这场战斗不分胜负。走出房间时，我又一次伸出手来；她也把手给了我。那是一双纤小、白嫩的手，却冰凉无比！我直视着她的眼睛，她也不得不直视我。这场最后的较量于我不利。我的目光一碰上她的就退却了——她的目光还是那样稳重、温和和平静；这种目光令我大失所望。","I enjoyed the game much, and did not hasten its conclusion.Sometimes I gave her hopes, beginning a sentence rather weakly, when her shrewd eye would light up; she thought she had me.Having led her a little way, I delighted to turn round and finish with sound, hard sense, whereat her countenance would fall.At last a servant entered to announce dinner.The conflict being thus necessarily terminated, we parted without having gained any advantage on either side.Mdlle. Reuter had not even given me an opportunity of attacking her with feeling, and I had managed to baffle her little schemes of craft.It was a regular drawn battle.I again held out my hand when I left the room; she gave me hers.It was a small and white hand, but how cool!I met her eye, too, in full, obliging her to give me a straightforward look.This last test went against me.It left her as it found her—moderate, temperate, tranquil; me it disappointed."
"“我变得更明智了。”在返回珀莱先生家的路上我这样想着，“瞧这个小女人。她不正像小说家和浪漫作家笔下的那些妇女吗？要读懂诗歌和小说中描绘的女性性格，那就得思考，不管是善良还是邪恶的性格，那都是由情感塑造的。这就是一个标本，而且是一个最具理性、最可敬的标本，而且大部分由抽象的理性构成。连塔列朗那种毫无激情的人，都不可拿来跟佐蕾德·勒泰相提并论。”这就是我那时候的想法。后来我才发现，情感迟钝的人个性通常也比较鲜明。","‘I am growing wiser,’ thought I, as I walked back to M. Pelet’s. ‘Look at this little woman.Is she like the women of novelists and romancers?To read of female character as depicted in poetry and fiction, one would think it was made up of sentiment, either for good or bad.Here is a specimen and a most sensible and respectable specimen too, whose staple ingredient is abstract reason.No Talleyrand was ever more passionless than Zoraïde Reuter.’ So I thought then.I found afterwards that blunt susceptibilities are very consistent with strong propensities."
"第十一章","CHAPTER XI"
"我的确和那个圆滑的小政治家谈了很久，回到住处时发现晚饭已经进行到一半了。该校有一项老规矩，就是不允许用餐的时候迟到，要是有哪个佛兰芒仆人，在用汤完毕、准备开始享用第一道菜的时候才进门，珀莱先生定会当众教训他一番，并且不许他喝汤吃鱼，以示惩罚。可是现在这种情况发生在我身上。那位客气而偏心的绅士却只是摇了摇头。我坐下来，打开餐巾，开始做饭前祷告。这时，他客气地差遣仆人去厨房给我端来一盘胡萝卜菜羹（因为今天是素食日），还留了一块鳕鱼干给我，才让人把头盘菜撤走。吃完晚餐，男孩们一窝蜂地涌到外面去玩了。金特和范达姆（那两个仆人）当然跟在他们后面一起出去了。","I had indeed had a very long talk with the crafty little politician, and on regaining my quarters I found that dinner was half over.To be late at meals was against a standing rule of the establishment, and had it been one of the Flemish ushers who thus entered after the removal of the soup and the commencement of the first course, M. Pelet would probably have greeted him with a public rebuke, and would certainly have mulcted him both of soup and fish.As it was, that polite though partial gentleman only shook his head, and as I took my place, unrolled my napkin, and said my heretical grace to myself, he civilly dispatched a servant to the kitchen, to bring me a plate of purée aux carottes (for this was a maigre day), and before sending away the first course, reserved for me a portion of the stock fish of which it consisted.Dinner being over, the boys rushed out for their evening play.Kint and Vandam (the two ushers) of course followed them."
"可怜的家伙们！要不是因为他们看上去如此笨拙，如此沉闷，对天上地下的一切事物如此不闻不问，那么，我会极其同情他们的，因为他们必须随时随地地围着那群粗鲁的孩子转。看完他们这样，再对比我自己，在回宿舍的路上我不禁觉得自己受到了特别的优待。我敢说，在宿舍里虽然谈不上什么欢乐，但至少还是不受约束的。今天晚上（过去也常有这样的情况），我还会得到进一步的优待。","Poor fellows! if they had not looked so very heavy, so very soulless, so very indifferent to all things in heaven above or in the earth beneath, I could have pitied them greatly for the obligation they were under to trail after those rough lads everywhere and at all times; even as it was, I felt disposed to scout myself as a privileged prig when I turned to ascend to my chamber, sure to find there, if not enjoyment, at least liberty; but this evening (as had often happened before) I was to be still further distinguished."
"“嘿，坏家伙！”我刚抬脚迈上一级台阶的时候，就听到身后珀莱先生的声音，“你要去哪儿？进餐厅来，我得教训你一下！”","‘Eh bien, mauvais sujet!’ said the voice of M. Pelet behind me, as I set my foot on the first step of the stair, ‘où allez-vous?Venez à la salle-Emanger, que je vous gronde un peu.’"
"“抱歉，先生，”我边说边跟在他身后进了他的私人客厅，“我晚上回来迟了。但这怪不得我啊。”","‘I beg pardon, monsieur,’ said I, as I followed him to his private sitting-room, ‘for having returned so late.It was not my fault.’"
"“那正是我想知道的，”珀莱先生边说边把我引进了那个舒适的客厅，客厅里的炭火烧得正旺，因为季节原因，炉子已经被搬走了。他按了下铃，叫了“两杯咖啡”，不一会我们就分别在炭火的两边坐了下来，颇有英国人的风格。我们中间放着一张小圆桌，上面有一个咖啡壶、一个糖罐和两只白色的大陶瓷杯。当珀莱先生娴熟地从一个盒子里抽出一支雪茄的时候，我又想起那两个在外面跟着孩子跑的看管，甚至现在我都还能听到他们为控制操场秩序而发出的嘶哑的喊声。","‘That is just what I want to know,’ rejoined M. Pelet, as he ushered me into the comfortable parlour with a good wood-fire, for the stove had now been removed for the season.Having rung the bell he ordered ‘Coffee for two,’ and presently he and I were seated, almost in English comfort, one on each side of the hearth, a little round table between us, with a coffee-pot, a sugar-basin, and two large white china cups.While M. Pelet employed himself in choosing a cigar from a box, my thoughts reverted to the two outcast ushers, whose voices I could hear even now crying hoarsely for order in the playground."
"“照顾他们，真是件苦差事。”我说道。","‘C’est une grande responsabilité, que la surveillance,’ observed I."
"“你说什么？”珀莱先生问。","‘Plaît-il??’ dit M. Pelet."
"我便表达了自己的想法，觉得范达姆先生和金特先生看管那群孩子有时肯定会有点劳累。","I remarked that I thought Messieurs Vandam and Kint must sometimes be a little fatigued with their labours."
"“两个狗娘养的——两个狗娘养的。”校长鄙夷地低声骂道。与此同时，我把一杯咖啡递给了他。","‘Des bêtes de somme—des bêtes de somme,’ murmured scornfully the director.Meantime I offered him his cup of coffee."
"“小伙子，请便。”当我把两大块大陆方糖加进他的杯子时，他温和地对我说道。“现在跟我说说为什么会在勒泰小姐家呆那么久。我知道她的学校可是和我的学校同一时间放学，都是四点钟；但你回到家的时候已经超过五点了。“","‘Servez-vous, mon garçon,’ said he blandly, when I had put a couple of huge lumps of Continental sugar into his cup.‘And now tell me why you stayed so long at Mdlle. Reuter’s.I know that lessons conclude, in her establishment as in mine, at four o’ clock, and when you returned it was past five.’"
"“先生，小姐要和我谈话。”","‘Mademoiselle wished to speak with me, monsieur.’"
"“真的啊！那请问谈论的什么话题？”","‘Indeed!On what subject, if one may ask?’"
"“小姐谈的是些无关紧要的话题，先生。”","‘Mademoiselle talked about nothing, monsieur.’"
"“真是个好话题！她是在教室里，当着学生的面跟你谈的吗？”","‘A fertile topic!And did she discourse thereon in the schoolroom, before the pupils?’"
"“不是的。跟您一样，先生，她也请我进她的客厅去。”","‘No.Like you, monsieur, she asked me to walk into her parlour.’"
"“那么勒泰夫人——那个老保姆——我妈的八卦姐妹，当然也在啦？”","‘And Madame Reuter—the old duenna—my mother’s gossip, was there, of course?’"
"“她不在，先生。很荣幸，就我跟小姐单独在一起。”","‘No, monsieur.I had the honour of being quite alone with mademoiselle.’"
"“太有趣了——这真是。”珀莱先生微笑着说道，眼睛盯着炭火。","‘C’est joli—cela,’ observed M. Pelet, and he smiled and looked into the fire."
"“但并不是你想的那样。”我郑重地小声说道。","‘Honi soit qui mal y pense,’ murmured I significantly."
"“你知道——我对我那位可爱的邻居是有所了解的。”","‘Je connais un peu ma petite voisine—voyez-vous.’"
"“那样的话，先生一定能够帮我解开这个谜团，为什么小姐会让我在她的沙发前坐上整整一个小时，对着我喋喋不休，滔滔不绝地发表演说，而谈的又都是些微不足道的小事儿？”","‘In that case, monsieur will be able to aid me in finding out what was mademoiselle’s reason for making me sit before her sofa one mortal hour, listening to the most copious and fluent dissertation on the merest frivolities.’"
"“她在试探你的性格。”","‘She was searching your character.’"
"“我想也是，先生。”","‘I thought so, monsieur.’"
"“她发现你的弱点了吗？”","‘Did she find out your weak point?’"
"“我弱点是什么？”","‘What is my weak point?’"
"“什么，情绪不定呀。克利姆斯沃斯，任何一个女人，只要把箭插得足够深，最后总能找到你心中的那深不可测的情感源泉。”","‘Why, the sentimental.Any woman sinking her shaft deep enough will at last reach a fathomless spring of sensibility in thy breast, Crimsworth.’"
"我顿时心中热血翻腾，随即便烧到脸上。","I felt the blood stir about my heart and rise warm to my cheek."
"“有的女人或许可以，先生。”","‘Some women might, monsieur.’"
"“勒泰小姐算不算呢？那么，跟我坦白说吧，我的孩子，她也还年轻，可能比你大几岁吧。不过你不正喜欢这样的吗，不但有母亲般的关爱，还有妻子般柔情？”","Is Mdlle. Reuter of the number?Come, speak frankly, mon fils; elle est encore jeune, plus âgée que toi peut-etre, mais juste assez pour unir la tendresse d'une petite maman à l’amour d’une épouse dévouée; n’est-ce pas que cela t’irait supérieurement?’"
"“不，先生；我觉得妻子就应该是妻子，而不是半个母亲。”","‘No, monsieur; I should like my wife to be my wife, and not half my mother.’"
"“那么，她的年纪对你来说是不是稍大了点？”","‘She is, then, a little too old for you?’"
"“不，先生；要是她其他方面适合我的话，年龄绝对不是问题。”","‘No, monsieur; not a day too old if she suited me in other things.’"
"“她哪点不合你意呢，威廉？难道她本人不可爱吗？”","‘In what does she not suit you, William?She is personally agreeable, is she not?’"
"“非常可爱。我就是喜欢她那种的发型和面容；她的体态虽说有点像比利时人，却韵味十足。”","‘Very.Her hair and complexion are just what I admire; and her turn of form, though quite Belgian, is full of grace.’"
"“很好！那你觉得她的脸庞、相貌怎么样呢？“","‘Bravo!And her face, her features—how do you like them?’"
"“有一点严肃，特别是嘴巴。”","‘A little harsh, especially her mouth.’"
"“啊，是的！她的嘴巴，“珀莱先生兀自低声笑着说。“她的嘴很有个性——刚毅；可是笑容还是非常令人愉快的，你不觉得吗？“","‘Ah, yes!her mouth,’ said M. Pelet, and he chuckled inwardly.‘There is character about her mouth—firmness; but she has a very pleasant smile; don’t you think so?’"
"“相当狡黠。”","‘Rather crafty.’"
"“说得没错，但是那种狡黠的表情是由于眉毛的缘故。你留意过她的眉毛没？”","‘True, but that expression of craft is owing to her eyebrows.Have you remarked her eyebrows?’"
"我回答说没有。","I answered that I had not."
"“那么，你没见过她低眉垂眼的样子？”他说。","‘You have not seen her looking down, then?’ said he."
"“没有。”","‘No.’"
"“无论如何，她的眉毛太有趣了。仔细观察一下，当她做针线活或帮其他妇女打下手的时候，当她娴静地坐着，精神集中在手里的针和丝绸，同时还听着旁边人的讨论，这时候，你就可以发现她与众不同之处了。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　她不参与。她那娇柔的心思全都放在手里的针线上；五官也很平静，不会微笑表示同意，也不会皱眉表示反对。双手勤快地做着那微不足道的活儿。对她来说，能绣好钱包或者做好帽子，就足够了。有哪位先生靠近她的话，她脸上的表情就会变得更加沉静，更加庄重，以掩盖她平时的仪态。这时注意观察她的眉毛，然后告诉我，是不是一边像猫，一边像狐狸？”","‘It is a treat, notwithstanding.Observe her when she has some knitting, or some other woman’s work in hand, and sits the image of peace, calmly intent on her needles and her silk, some discussion meantime going on around her, in the course of which peculiarities of character are being developed or important interests canvassed.She takes no part in it.Her humble, feminine mind is wholly with her knitting; none of her features move, she neither presumes to smile approval nor frown disapprobation, her little hands assiduously ply their unpretending task.If she can only get this purse finished or this bonnet-grec completed, it is enough for her.If gentlemen approach her chair, a deeper quiescence, a meeker modesty settles on her features and clothes her general mien.Observe then her eyebrows, et dites-moi s’il n’y a pas du chat dans l’un et du renard dans l‘autre.’"
"“下次有机会我一定好好瞧瞧。”我说。","‘I will take careful notice the first opportunity,’ said I."
"“接着，”珀莱先生接着说，”她眼皮会跳跃，浅色的睫毛也跟着上扬。这时，一双蓝色的眼睛立马就从眼睑底下显露出来，向四周扫视一下又缩回去了。","‘And then,’ continued M. Pelet, ’the eyelid will flicker, the light-coloured lashes he lifted a second, and a blue eye, glancing out from under the screen, will take its brief, sly, searching survey, and retreat again."
"我微微笑了下，珀莱也笑了；片刻沉默以后，我问，——","I smiled and so did Peter, and after a few minutes’ silence, I asked,—"
"“你觉得她会结婚吗？”","‘Will she ever marry, do you think?’"
"“当然会！鸟儿不也要配对吗？当然，她愿意也打算在找到合适的对象时就结婚，没有人比她更清楚自己可以给别人留下什么印象。没人比她更喜欢不动声色地俘获男人的心。克利姆斯沃思，如果她还没有悄悄地在你的内心留下足迹，那就是我误解她了。”","‘Marry!Will birds pair?Of course it is both her intention and resolution to marry when she finds a suitable match, and no one is better aware than herself of the sort of impression she is capable of producing.No one likes better to captivate in a quiet way. I am mistaken if she will not yet leave the print of her stealing steps on thy heart, Crimsworth.’"
"“她的足迹？搞错啦，才没有！我的心又不是让人随意行走的木板。”","‘Of her steps?Confound it, no!My heart is not a plank to be walked on.’"
"“但是天鹅爪子柔软的触摸并不会伤害它呀。”","‘But the soft touch of a palate de velours will do it no harm.’"
"“她的天鹅爪子可没伸向我。在我面前，她可是很矜持保守的。”","‘She offers me no palate de velours.She is all form and reserve with me.’"
"“一开始是这样的。让尊重为地基，感情为第一层楼，而爱则为上层建筑。勒泰小姐可是个技艺精湛的建筑师。”","‘That to begin with.Let respect be the foundation, affection the first floor, love the superstructure.Mdlle. Reuter is a skilful architect.’"
"“那兴趣，珀莱先生——兴趣。难道小姐不考虑这一点吗？”","‘And interest, M. Pelet—interest.Will not mademoiselle consider that point?’"
"“当然，当然要考虑了，这还用说。兴趣是粘合在两块石头之间的水泥。既然我们谈论完了女校长，那么学生呢？那些年轻的美人没有值得琢磨的吗？”","‘Yes, yes, no doubt; it will he the cement between every stone.And now we have discussed the directness, what of the pupils?N’y-a-t-il pas de belles études parmi ces jeunes têtes?’"
"“研究她们的性格？是啊。都是些奇怪家伙们，至少，我是这么觉得。不过第一次见面，还不能看出什么来。”","‘Studies of character?Yes; curious ones, at least, I imagine; but one cannot divine much from a first interview.’"
"“哎，真是缺乏判断力。那你现在告诉我，在那些貌美如花的年轻女孩子面前，你不觉得有点害羞吗？”","‘Ah, you affect discretion; but tell me now, were you not a little abashed before those blooming young creatures?’"
"“起先是有的；但当我冷静下来后，就容地应付过了。”","‘At first, yes; but I rallied and got through with all due sang-froid."
"“我不相信。”","‘I don’t believe you.’"
"“可这无论如何是真的。开始我觉得她们像天使一样，但很快就发现这只是个幻觉。是班上那三个年龄最大、最漂亮的女生让我改变了之前的看法；她们的确聪明了得，以至于我在五分钟之内就看穿她们了，至少，我知道她们是什么样的人——三个彻头彻尾的风尘女子。”","‘It is true, notwithstanding.At first I thought them angels, but they did not leave me long under that delusion.Three of the eldest and handsomest undertook the task of setting me right, and they managed so cleverly that in five minutes I knew them, at least, for what they were—three arrant coquettes.’"
"“我知道她们！”珀莱先生叫道，“无论是在教堂里，或是公共场所，她们都艳压群芳。一个是高傲的金发美女，一个是漂亮的捣蛋鬼，一个是皮肤淡褐色的美人。”","‘Je les connais!’ exclaimed M. Pelet. ‘Elles sont toujours au premier rang à l’église et a la promenade; une blonde superbe, une jolie espiegle, une belle brune.’"
"“就是她们。”","‘Exactly.’"
"“她们都是可爱的小家伙——艺术家的宠儿。要是把她们聚在一起，该多么引人注目啊！厄拉利（我知道她们的名字）是一个有着柔顺的辫子、象牙般双眉的娴静女孩。奥尔唐斯一头深栗色的头发又是编又是拧的，好像她不知道该拿她那些浓密的头发怎么办；她嘴唇朱红，脸蛋粉嫩，眼睛调皮且带着笑意。而卡罗琳·布勒蒙！啊，真是个美人儿——无可挑剔的美人儿！黑色的鬈发像云朵一样飘散在这个天使般的脸蛋周围！多么迷人的嘴唇啊！多么高贵的黑眼睛啊！就连你们的拜伦也会对她顶礼膜拜的。可你——你这个冷漠的孤岛居民！——在这么精致可人的阿弗罗迪特面前，你怎么能无动于衷，视而不见呢？”","‘Lovely creatures all of them—heads for artists.What a group they would make, taken together!Eulalie (I know their names), with her smooth braided hair and calm ivory brow.Hortense, with her rich chestnut locks, so luxuriantly knotted, plaited, twisted, as if she did not know how to dispose of all their abundance, with her vermilion lips, damask cheek, and roguish laughing eye. And Caroline de Blemont!Ah, there is beauty—beauty in perfection!What a cloud of sable curls about the face of a houri!What fascinating lips!What glorious black eyes!Your Byron would have worshipped her, and you—you cold, frigid islander!—you played the austere, the insensible in the presence of an Aphrodite so exquisite?’"
"要是我相信这位校长所说的话，那我定会耻笑他的热情。但我发现，他的语气里有一种狂喜的韵味。我明白他只是假装热情想让我卸下防备，好对他坦白，所以我连笑都没笑。他继续说道——","I might have laughed at the director’s enthusiasm had I believed it real, but there was something in his tone which indicated got-up raptures.I felt he was only affecting fervour in order to put me off my guard, to induce me to come out in return, so I scarcely even smiled.He went on,—"
"“说实话，威廉——只是五官端正的佐蕾德·勒泰小姐和她那些貌美如花的学生比起来不是逊色很多吗？”","‘Confess, William—do not the mere good looks of Zoraïde Reuter appear dowdyish and commonplace compared with the splendid charms of some of her pupils?’"
"这个问题真烦人，但我清楚地感到，校长努力（原因他内心最清楚——那时，我也想不通）想要激起我内心那与正确和高尚相异的想法和愿望。当他看到我丝毫不受他那邪恶煽动的影响时，接着说道——","The question discomposed me, but I now felt plainly that my principal was endeavouring (for reasons best known to himself—at that time I could not fathom them) to excite ideas and wishes in my mind alien to what was right and honourable.The iniquity of the instigation proved its antidote, and when he further added,—"
"“这三个漂亮的女孩都会有一个美好的将来；只有像你这样低调、绅士和智慧的年轻人，才有可能成为三位中任何一位小姐和她钱包的主人。”","‘Each of those three beautiful girls will have a handsome fortune; and with a little address, a gentlemanlike, intelligent young fellow like you might make himself master of the hand, heart, and purse of any one of the trio.’"
"我看了他一眼，用质疑的语气答道：“是吗，先生？”这让他吓了一跳。","I replied by a look and an interrogative ‘Monsieur?’ which startled him."
"他勉强挤出一丝笑容，再次强调自己只是在开玩笑，并问我是不是把他的话当真了。就在这时钟声响了，娱乐时间结束了。这天晚上珀莱先生像往常一样要去朗读戏剧片段及情书给他的学生们听。他没等我回答就起身离开了房间，边走还边吟诵几句贝兰热的诗句。","He laughed a forced laugh, affirmed that he had only been joking, and demanded whether I could possibly have thought him in earnest.Just then the bell rang; the play-hour was over.It was an evening on which M. Pelet was accustomed to read passages from the drama and the belles lettres to his pupils.He did not wait for my answer, but rising, left the room, humming as he went some gay strain of Béranger’s."
"第十二章","CHAPTER XII"
"我继续留在勒泰小姐的女子学院任教，日复一日，我发现了不少可以比较理想和现实的机会。在来布鲁塞尔之前，我对女性性格又了解多少呢？真是少之又少。女性性格对我又是一种什么样的概念呢？这一概念模糊、不牢靠、轻飘而耀眼。如今当我与它接触之后，我才发觉那是一种很明显的、实实在在的东西——有时也非常坚硬，通常又很沉重。里面注满了金属，有铅，也有铁。","Daily, as I continued my attendance at the seminary of Mdlle. Reuter, did I find fresh occasions to compare the ideal with the real.What had I known of female character previously to my arrival at Brussels?Precious little.And what was my notion of it?Something vague, slight, gauzy, glittering.Now when I came in contact with it I found it to be a palpable substance enough—very hard too sometimes, and often heavy.There was metal in it, both lead and iron."
"让那些幻想着尘世天使和人间花朵的理想主义者及梦想家们到这里来看一下吧，而我则要打开文件夹，向他们展示一两幅用铅笔勾勒的素描。这些素描是我在勒泰小姐学校的二班教室里完成的，我从那收集了大概一百来件少女标本，种类繁多，题材不一。花色齐全，各个阶级、各个国籍都有。我坐在讲台上，扫视着那一长排桌子时，看到的是法国人、英国人、比利时人、奥地利人，还有普鲁士人。她们大多数来自资产阶级家庭，但也有不少女伯爵，有两位将军的女儿，还有几位是上校、上尉及政府办公人员的女儿。与这些小姐们并肩坐在一起的还有那些命中注定要当店铺老板女儿的年轻女子，以及该国一些真正的佛兰芒土著女子。在衣着打扮上她们几乎没什么区别，举手投足也相差无几。当然也有与众不同的；但这绝大多数人使学校的校风变得粗俗、喧闹，有个特征是：学生之间或者学生跟老师之间，直接全然不顾对方的忍耐力，各自急切地追求着各自的利益和便利，对别人的利益和便利通常漠视不理。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　如果说谎能得到好处的话，大多数人都会明目张胆地撒谎。一有什么好处可谋，所有人都变得巧舌如簧；然而，一旦发现客气已不能带来什么利益时，立马就能驾轻就熟地转脸无情。公开的争吵在学生中间是很罕见的；但在人后嚼舌头和散布谣言的现象却是司空见惯的。学校规矩严禁亲密的友谊，女孩子之间互相关心，只不过是因为她们厌烦孤单寂寞，需要有人陪伴而已。所有人都被人怀疑在背后做了什么见不得人的坏事。而她们所做的防备措施更是数不胜数，让她们处于即便不是愚蠢，但也不是无知的境地。可为什么，这些已经年过十四岁的女孩几乎没有一个能够谦逊、大方地直视一个男子呢？她们对一个男子最普通的眼神的回应都是鲁莽的调情，或放荡、愚蠢的勾引。我完全不了解罗马天主教的秘密，也不盲信神学；但我怀疑，天主教国家女孩这么明显，这么普遍的早熟与不纯洁，即使不能从罗马教堂的教义中，也可以从其戒律中找到根源。我记录下了我的所见。这些姑娘们都出身于社会上受人尊崇的阶层。她们全都在精心呵护下长大，然而，很多人的思想却很堕落。对于她们大致的看法就这么多。接下来，我们看看一两副精挑细选的素描画像吧。","Let the idealists, the dreamers about earthly angels and human flowers, just look here while I open my portfolio and show them a sketch or two, pencilled after nature.I took these sketches in the second-class schoolroom of Mdlle. Reuter’s establishment, where about a hundred specimens of the genus jeune fille collected together offered a fertile variety of subject.A miscellaneous assortment they were, differing both in caste and country.As I sat on my estrade and glanced over the long range of desks, I had under my eye French, English, Belgians, Austrians, and Prussians.The majority belonged to the class bourgeois; but there were many countesses, there were the daughters of two generals, and of several colonels, captains, and government employes.These ladies sat side by side with young females destined to be demoiselles de magasins, and with some Flamandes, genuine aborigines of the country.In dress all were nearly similar, and in manners there was small difference; exceptions there were to the general rule, but the majority gave the tone to the establishment, and that tone was rough, boisterous, marked by a point-blank disregard of all forbearance towards each other or their teachers, an eager pursuit by each individual of her own interest and convenience, and a coarse indifference to the interest and convenience of every one else.Most of them could lie with audacity when it appeared advantageous to do so.All understood the art of speaking fair when a point was to be gained, and could with consummate skill and at a moment’s notice  the instant civility ceased to be profitable.Very little open quarrelling ever took place amongst them, but backbiting and talebearing were universal.Close friendships were forbidden by the rules of the school, and no one girl seemed to cultivate more regard for another than was just necessary to secure a companion when solitude would have been irksome.They were each and all supposed to have been reared in utter unconsciousness of vice.The precautions used to keep them ignorant, if not innocent, were innumerable.How was it, then, that scarcely one of those girls, having attained the age of fourteen, could look a man in the face with modesty and propriety?An air of bold, impudent flirtation, or a loose, silly leer, was sure to answer the most ordinary glance from a masculine eye.I know nothing of the arcana of the Roman Catholic religion, and I am not a bigot in matters of theology, but I suspect the root of this precocious impurity, so obvious, so general in Popish countries, is to be found in the discipline if not the doctrines of the Church of Rome.I record what I have seen.These girls belonged to what are called the respectable ranks of society.They had all been carefully brought up, yet was the mass of them mentally depraved.So much for the general view; now for one or two selected specimens."
"第一幅画是奥里莉亚·科斯洛的全身像。她是一位德国小姐，或者更准确地说是一位德、俄混血儿。她今年十八岁，被送到布鲁塞尔来接受教育。她中等身材，体格壮硕，身长腿短，胸部虽未完全成型却很丰满，腰部被一件紧身胸衣残忍而不协调地包裹着；她的衣着是经过精心搭配的，一双大脚被硬塞进小靴子里；脑袋很小，头发被整齐地梳成辫子，上面还涂着发油和树胶以保持完美；她前额低平，一双极小的灰眼睛发出凶狠的光芒；样子有点像鞑靼人；鼻子扁平，颧骨突出；但总的来说，并不是非常难看，脸色也还可以。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　这就是她的外貌。至于思想嘛，可以说无知到了令人可悲的地步，甚至连自己的母语——德语都写不好也说不好，法语更是一塌糊涂，还要学英语，真是太荒唐了。尽管她上学已十二年了，但由于她的各种练习无一例外都是叫一位同学帮她完成的，上课时又偷偷摸摸把课外书放在大腿上看，这就怪不得她进步的速度就像蜗牛爬行了。我不知道奥里莉亚的日常生活里有些什么习惯，因为我没有机会成天观察她。但从她的课桌、书本和考卷上看来，我应该说她是一个不修边幅，甚至是脏乱的女生。她的外套，就如我所说的，保持得很干净。而当我从她的凳子后面走过去时，会发现她的脖子由于没有清洗而灰灰的；头发因为抹了发胶与发油显得油乎乎的，让人都懒得伸手去触摸，更别说用手指去揉一揉了。奥里莉亚在班上表现得非常好，至少我在的时候是这样的。这可以被视为少女幼稚的标志吧。我进教室的那一刻，她正用胳膊肘推邻桌的同学，还沉浸于难以掩饰的笑声中。我在讲台上坐下后，她的眼光便锁住了我；看来她是下定决心要引起我的注意了，有可能的话，还想独霸我的注意力。为此，她用各种各样的目光对我展开攻势——孱弱的、挑衅的、诱惑的、嘲弄的。后来发现这种攻势对我完全不起作用——因为人们都对那些不请自来的东西不屑一顾——她不得不换一种手段，制造起噪音来。她一会叹息，一会呻吟，一会又发出难以用言语名状的声音。我在教室里巡视时，如果从她身边走过，她就会把脚伸出来碰我的脚。这时，如果我碰巧没发现她的诡计，让自己的靴子碰到她的靴子时，她就装出一副想笑又不敢笑的痉挛的样子；如果诡计被我识破且躲开了，她就会绷着脸愠怒地操着难听的低地德语，用蹩脚的法语低声骂我。","The first picture is a full length of Aurelia Koslow, a German fräulein,, or rather a half-breed between German and Russian.She is eighteen years of age, and has been sent to Brussels to finish her education.She is of middle size, stiffly made, body long, legs short, bust much developed but not compactly moulded, waist disproportionately compressed by an inhumanly braced corset, dress carefully arranged, large feet tortured into small bottines, head small, hair smoothed, braided, oiled, and gummed to perfection, very low forehead, very diminutive and vindictive gray eyes, somewhat Tartar features, rather flat nose, rather high cheekbones, yet the ensemble not positively ugly, tolerably good complexion.So much for person.As to mind—deplorably ignorant and ill-informed, incapable of writing or speaking correctly even German, her native tongue; a dunce in French, and her attempts at learning English a mere farce.Yet she has been at school twelve years; but as she invariably gets her exercises of every description done by a fellow-pupil, and reads her lessons off a book concealed in her lap, it is not wonderful that her progress has been so snail-like.I do not know what Aurelia’s daily habits of life are, because I have not the opportunity of observing her at all times; but from what I see of the state of her desk, books, and papers, I should say she is slovenly and even dirty.Her outward dress, as I have said, is well attended to; but in passing behind her bench, I have remarked that her neck is gray for want of washing, and her hair, so glossy with gum and grease, is not such as one feels tempted to pass the hand over, much less to run the fingers through.Aurelia’s conduct in class, at least when I am present, is something extraordinary, considered as an index of girlish innocence.The moment I enter the room, she nudges her next neighbour and indulges in a half-suppressed laugh.As I take my seat on the estrade, she fixes her eye on me; she seems resolved to attract and if possible monopolize my notice.To this end she launches at me all sorts of looks—languishing, provoking, leering, laughing.As I am found quite proof against this sort of artillery—for we scorn what, unasked, is lavishly offered—she has recourse to the expedient of making noises.Sometimes she sighs, sometimes groans, sometimes utters inarticulate sounds for which language has no name.If, in walking up the schoolroom, I pass near her, she puts out her foot that it may touch mine.If I do not happen to observe the manoeuvre, and my boot comes in contact with her brodequin, she affects to fall into convulsions of suppressed laughter; if I notice the snare and avoid it, she expresses her mortification in sullen muttering, where I hear myself abused in bad French, pronounced with an intolerable Low German accent."
"科斯洛小姐不远处坐着另一位叫阿德尔·德朗萨尔的年轻女士。她是比利时人，个子有点矮，身形笨拙，腰身粗壮，脖子、四肢都短短的，脸色白里透红，五官端正，眉目分明，眼睛和头发都是淡褐色的，牙齿整洁，年纪十五岁多一点，但身材却丰满得像一个壮实的二十岁英国女子。这幅画像给出的不正是一位略微矮胖却样貌好看的少女吗？当我看着面前这些年轻的面孔，我的目光总会停留在阿德尔身上。她也好像总是凝神等着跟我的眼神交汇，而且时常能够成功。她长相非凡——那么年轻、稚嫩、有朝气，却又像蛇发女妖一般。前额上布有猜忌、愠怒和火爆的表情，目光含有凶狠的习性，嘴角露着嫉妒的、豹子般的狡诈。总体来说，她坐下时非常安静。她那庞大的身形看似弯不下来，那上窄下宽的脑袋也是如此——看上去就要从那短脖子上断开来一样。她的脸上只有两种表情——经常出现的是一种严峻、不满的皱眉的样子，有时会变成一种极其可恶而狡诈的微笑。同学们对她退避三舍，虽说那些学生有许多也很坏，但几乎没有谁能坏到她那个地步。","Nor far from Mdlle. Koslow sits another young lady, by name Adele Dronsart.This is a Belgian, rather low of stature, in form heavy, with broad waist, short neck and limbs, good red and white complexion, features well chiselled and regular, well-cut eyes of a dear brown colour, light brown hair, good teeth, age not much above fifteen, but as full grown as a stout young Englishwoman of twenty.This portrait gives the idea of a somewhat dumpy but good-looking damsel, does it not?Well, when I looked along the row of young heads, my eye generally stopped at this of Adele’s.Her gaze was ever waiting for mine, and it frequently succeeded in arresting it.She was an unnatural-looking being—so young, fresh, blooming, yet so Gorgon-like.Suspicion, sullen ill-temper were on her forehead, vicious propensities in her eve, envy and panther-like deceit about her mouth.In general she sat very still.Her massive shape looked as if it could not bend much, nor did her large head so broad at the base, so narrow towards the top—seem made to turn readily on her short neck.She had but two varieties of expression—the prevalent one a forbidding, dissatisfied scowl, varied sometimes by a most pernicious and perfidious smile.She was shunned by her fellow-pupils, for, bad as many of them were, few were as bad as she."
"奥里莉亚与阿德尔都在二班的第一组。第二组由一位名叫朱安娜·特里斯塔的寄宿生领导。这位女孩是比利时与西班牙混血儿。她母亲是佛兰芒人，已经去世了，父亲是加泰罗尼亚商人，居住在某个不知名的群岛上；朱安娜就是在那儿出生的，后来被送到欧洲来求学。我真想知道，看到这个女孩的脑袋和脸孔还有谁敢收她作学生。她的头型和亚历山大六世的毫无二致。她极少有仁爱之心，对人也很少表现出崇敬、责任感和忠心；然而她又非常自尊、坚定、充满破坏力和战斗力。她脑袋的形状像阁楼一样，前额向内收缩，后脑勺又向外突出。虽然五官巨大而醒目，却很漂亮。她个性坚韧，脾气暴躁，脸色苍白、阴郁，头发和眼睛都是黑色的；身形消瘦、僵直，不过看上去比例很好，年龄是十五岁。","Aurelia and Adele were in the first division of the second class.The second division was headed by a pensionnaire named Juanna Trista.This girl was of mixed Belgian and Spanish origin.Her Flemish mother was dead, her Catalonian father was a merchant residing in the—Isles, where Juanna had been born, and whence she was sent to Europe to be educated.I wonder that any one, looking at that girl’s head and countenance, would have received her under their roof.She had precisely the same shape of skull as Pope Alexander the Sixth.Her organs of benevolence, veneration, conscientiousness, adhesiveness, were singularly small; those of self-esteem firmness, destructiveness, combativeness, preposterously large.Her head sloped up in the penthouse shape, was contracted about the forehead, and prominent behind.She had rather good though large and marked features.Her temperament was fibrous and bilious, her complexion pale and dark, hair and eyes black, form angular and rigid but proportionate, age fifteen."
"朱安娜不算太瘦，却脸色憔悴，眼里满是凶狠贪婪的神色。尽管她的额头很窄，却有足够的空间能够清晰地刻下两个单词：叛逆和仇恨。从她其他的五官里——我觉得是眼睛——明显可以看出她的懦弱。特里斯塔小姐认为，粗俗的工作日式的暴乱比较适合用来扰乱我的第一堂课。她嘴巴里噪音阵阵，象一匹马一样，口水乱喷，尽说些粗野的话。坐在她身后的是一群粗俗、其貌不扬的佛兰芒人，这里面还有两三个残疾人和低能儿。她们在低地国家如此常见，似乎证明了那儿的气候不但让人类智力退化，还让人的身体产生畸形，真是太可怕了。不一会儿我就发现，这些佛兰芒人完全是受了她的影响，跟她一起掀起了杀猪一般的暴动，最后我无计可施，只能罚她和她的两个走卒起来站了五分钟，而后把她们赶出教室，骚乱才得以平息；那两个走卒被赶到教室隔壁的一个大厅，主犯则被单独反锁在一个小房间里，我做这些的时候勒泰小姐也在场。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　看我对付学生的果断样子，她都被吓呆了——她在学校里还从来没见过这么严厉的处罚手段。面对她的惊恐，我以冷静的表情回应她，而后又给了她一个微笑，这可能会显得有点奉承，但肯定让她放松不少。朱安娜·特里斯塔在欧洲的时间长得足够用狠毒和忘恩负义来回报所有对她好的人；后来，她去到某某群岛找她父亲了，一想到那儿有一群奴隶可以让她肆意打骂，她就兴奋得不得了。","Juanna was not very thin, but she had a gaunt visage, and her regard was fierce and hungry.Narrow as was her brow it presented space enough for the legible graving of two words, Mutiny and Hate.In some one of her other lineaments—I think the eye—cowardice had also its distinct cipher.Mdlle. Trista thought fit to trouble my first lessons with a coarse work-day sort of turbulence.She made noises with her mouth like a horse, she ejected her saliva, she uttered brutal expressions.Behind and below her were seated a band of very vulgar, inferior-looking Flamandes, including two or three examples of that deformity of person and imbecility of intellect whose frequency in the Low Countries would seem to furnish proof that the climate is such as to induce degeneracy of the human mind and body.These, I soon found, were completely under her influence, and with their aid she got up and sustained a swinish tumult, which I was constrained at last to quell by ordering her and two of her tools to rise from their seats, and, having kept them standing five minutes, turning them bodily out of the schoolroom the accomplices into a large place adjoining called the grande salle, the principal into a cabinet, of which I closed the door and pocketed the key. This judgment I executed in the presence of Mdlle.Reuter who looked much aghast at beholding so decided a proceeding—the most severe that had ever been ventured on in her establishment.Her look of affright I answered with one of composure, and finally with a smile, which perhaps flattered, and certainly soothed her.Juanna Trista remained in Europe long enough to repay, by malevolence and ingratitude, all who had ever done her a good turn; and she then went to join her father in the—Isles, exulting in the thought that she should there have slaves, whom, as she said, she could kick and strike at will."
"这三幅都是日常生活照。我手里还有一些其他的，同样醒目，让人不快。但我不打算拿出来跟读者分享了。","These three pictures are from the life.I possess others, as marked and as little agreeable, but I will spare my reader the exhibition of them."
"毋庸置疑，大家都会认为我现在应该拿出一些迷人的作品出来以作对比——一些头顶光晕的温柔少女的头像或是一些天真的、怀抱着和平鸽的甜美画像。不！那样的少女我一个也没见过，所以画不出来。学校里个性最活泼的是一个来自比利时的名叫路易斯·帕斯的女孩子。她非常仁爱、乐于助人，却缺乏教养和礼仪。而且，虚荣这种致命伤也在她身上体现出来了。她不知何为荣誉和纪律，甚至也不知它们的存在。最中规中矩的就是我之前提过一次的那个可怜的小西尔维了。西尔维仪态优美，头脑聪慧。她待人真诚无比，又合乎宗教礼仪，但身体却有点虚弱。身体欠佳让她的成长和精神都受到折磨；就像命中注定要进修道院一样，她的整个灵魂也被扭曲成了一个修女的形象，从她那柔弱和逆来顺受的样子就可以看出，她已经准备好将独立思考和行事的权力交给某一位暴虐的神父。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　她不容许自己有自己的见解，或自行选择伴侣和职业的权力，别人让她做什么就做什么。她整天虚弱、消极地任人差遣，四处奔忙——那些都不是她喜欢的或从心底里觉得是对的事，这位可怜的未来小信徒早就明白应该使自己的理智与良心受精神领袖的意志来支配。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　她堪称勒泰小姐学院里的典范。这个苍白、憔悴的小人儿，虽然还在虚弱地喘着一口气，灵魂却早已被天主教的魔法掠去了。","Doubtless it will be thought that I ought now, by way of contrast, to show something charming—some gentle virgin head, circled with a halo, some sweet personification of innocence, clasping the dove of peace to her bosom.No. I saw nothing of the sort, and therefore cannot portray it.The pupil in the school possessing the happiest disposition was a young girl from the country, Louise Path.She was sufficiently benevolent and obliging, but not well taught nor well mannered.Moreover, the plague-spot of dissimulation was in her also.Honour and principle were unknown to her; she had scarcely heard their names.The least exceptionable pupil was the poor little Sylvie I have mentioned once before.Sylvie was gentle in manners, intelligent in mind.She was even sincere, as far as her religion would permit her to be so; but her physical organization was defective.Weak health stunted her growth and chilled her spirits, and then, destined as she was for the cloister, her whole soul was warped to a conventual bias, and in the tame, trained subjection of her manner one read that she had already prepared herself for her future course of life by giving up her independence of thought and action into the hands of some despotic confessor.She permitted herself no original opinion, no preference of companion or employment; in everything she was guided by another.With a pale, passive, automaton air, she went about all day long doing what she was bid—never what she liked, or what, from innate conviction, she thought it right to do. The poor little future religieuse had been early taught to make the dictates of her own reason and conscience quite subordinate to the will of her spiritual director.She was the model pupil of Mdlle.Reuter’s establishment—pale, blighted image, where life lingered feebly, but whence the soul had been conjured by Romish wizard-craft."
"学校里还有几个英国学生，她们可以分成两类。一类是居住在大陆的英国人——主要是那些破产的风险家的女儿，这些风险家因为债务或羞耻而被迫离开自己的国家。这些可怜的姑娘们从来就没有体验过安居的乐趣，也没有合适的榜样可以学习，更没有得到过诚实的基督教教育。她们跟着父母从一个国家迁徙到另一个国家——从法国到德国，从德国到比利时，只能在这个天主教学校呆几个月，又在那个学校呆几个月——她们接受了一些不完整的教育，染上了坏习惯，甚至丢失了宗教与道德中最重要的东西，变成彻头彻尾的傻瓜，对所有有关道德修养的事情不屑一顾。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　这分明地写在她们那一惯郁郁寡欢的脸上；这是因为不仅她们的自尊遭到践踏，还不断受到来自天主教同学的恐吓，那些同学憎恨她们是英国人，鄙视她们是异教徒。","A few English pupils there were in this school, and these might be divided into two classes.First the Continental English—the daughters chiefly of broken adventurers, whom debt or dishonour had driven from their own country.These poor girls had never known the advantages of settled homes, decorous example, or honest Protestant education.Resident a few months now in one Catholic school, now in another, as their parents wandered from land to land—from France to Germany, from Germany to Belgium—they had picked up some scanty instruction, many bad habits, losing every notion even of the first elements of religion and morals, and acquiring an imbecile indifference to every sentiment that can elevate humanity.They were distinguishable by an habitual look of sullen dejection, the result of crushed self-respect and constant browbeating from their Popish fellow-pupils, who hated them as English, and scorned them as heretics."
"另一类是不列颠英国人。这一类学生我在学院任职期间见到的也就五六个。她们的特征有：干净随意的打扮，乱蓬蓬的头发（与梳理得一丝不苟的外国人相比），挺直的身材，婀娜的身姿，白皙纤细的双手，不及比利时人端正但却更显聪明的五官，严肃端庄的表情，庄重得体的礼仪，单凭最后一点，我便能区分不列颠人、耶稣教徒和罗马教徒的女儿。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　这些大不列颠女孩还有一个共同的特点，就是骄傲；一旦遭到那些大陆英国人的嫉妒或耻笑，她们便会严肃又礼貌地避开她们，沉默却又蔑视地回应她们的仇恨。她们拒绝有人陪伴，在人群中也显得孤零零。","The second class were British English.Of these I did not encounter half a dozen during the whole time of my attendance at the seminary.Their characteristics were clean but careless dress, ill-arranged hair (compared with the tight and trim foreigners), erect carriage, flexible figures, white and taper hands, features more irregular but also more intellectual than those of the Belgians, grave and modest countenances, a general air of native propriety and decency; by this last circumstance alone I could at a glance distinguish the daughter of Albion and nursling of Protestantism from the foster-child of Rome, the protégé of Jesuitry.Proud, too, was the aspect of these British girls; at once envied and ridiculed by their Continental associates, they warded off insult with austere civility, and met hate with mute disdain.They eschewed company-keeping, and in the midst of numbers seemed to dwell isolated."
"一共有三位法国老师负责管理这群鱼龙混杂的学生——她们是泽菲兰小姐，佩拉吉小姐和絮泽特小姐。后两位实在太普通了。平庸的外表，平庸的举止，平庸的脾气，就连她们的思想、情感和看法也毫无特点可言。要是以她们为题单独写一章，我也没有更多的话可说。泽菲兰在长相和举止方面要比佩拉吉和絮泽特出彩一些，但在个性方面，她却背信弃义、贪得无厌、冷血无情，是个真真正正的风骚巴黎女人。第四个老师我有时会碰到，她好像每天都会来教女孩们做针线活、编织、缝花边或做一些类似的手工活；但是她给我的印象，只不过是匆匆一瞥，那还是她跟她那十几个稍微大点的女学生一起坐在餐厅的时候——所以我根本没机会了解她的个性，就连多看几眼也很难。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　我发现，后面那个老师，有种女孩气质；除此之外，什么都不起眼。说到个性，我感觉她没什么个性可言，因为她在学生面前没什么威信。她不住学校，我想她应该是叫亨利小姐。","The teachers presiding over this mixed multitude were three in number, all French—their names Mdlles. Zéphyrine, Pélagie, and Suzette.The two last were commonplace personages enough.Their look was ordinary, their manner was ordinary, their temper was ordinary, their thoughts, feelings, and views were all ordinary.Were I to write a chapter on the subject I could not elucidate it further.Zéphyrine was somewhat more distinguished in appearance and deportment than Pélagie and Suzette, but in character a genuine Parisian coquette, perfidious, mercenary, and dry-hearted.A fourth maîtresse I sometimes saw who seemed to come daily to teach needle-work, or netting, or lace-mending or some such flimsy art; but of her I never had more than a passing glimpse, as she sat in the carré, with her frames and some dozen of the elder pupils about her—consequently I had no opportunity of studying her character, or even of observing her person much.The latter, I remarked, had a very girlish air for a maîtresse; otherwise it was not striking.Of character I should think she possessed but little, as her pupils seemed constantly en revolte against her authority.She did not reside in the house; her name, I think, was Mdlle. Henri."
"这是一群微不足道、满身陋习、邪恶且令人厌恶的学生（许多人会用最后一个词去形容那两三个呆板、沉默、行为正派、衣着不整的不列颠女孩），而那位理性、睿智、和善的女校长像恒星一样在沼泽上空闪耀着光辉。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　她深知自己高人一等这种意识支撑着她承受所有的烦恼和责任，这些都是她作为校长不可避免的。这使她心态平和，眉宇舒展，态度安详。她喜欢——谁会不喜欢呢？——一迈入教室，就只是她单独一人便足以打破秩序和安静，这是那些下属老师抗议甚至命令也没办法做到的。她喜欢跟周围的人比较，或者确切地说是对比，来显示自己在智力方面、人品方面所占的无可非议的优势（那三位女教师都很平庸）。她如此溺爱、宽恕她的学生——嘉奖和表扬的事都是她来做，而责备和惩罚的工作却留给其他那些老师——学生们即使喜欢她，也尊敬她。而教师们却不喜欢她，但因为没有一个方面能胜出她，也就都屈从了。在学院任职的那些老师们在不同程度上都受到了她的影响。一个脾气恶略的男老师被她高超的管理手段所屈服；另一个反复无常的老师被她放任的态度所治服；第三个老师被她的讨好之辞折服；至于第四个——一个懦弱的人——被她那种严正决绝的威严所驯服；而对于我，她还在观察中，仍然用一些最精心的测试在考验我。她游走于我周围，虽困惑却还不屈不挠，我想，她应该会觉得我像一面光滑裸露的峭壁，既没有突出的石块，也没有树根或者草丛可助其攀爬。她一下不露痕迹地奉承我；一下用道德教诲我；一下又用金钱诱惑我；接着又跟我玩暧昧，深知可以利用弱点来击败某些男人；她说了些富有哲理的话，知道有些人会愚蠢地因此而对她产生钦佩之情。很快我便发现要让她的这些努力幻灭不但容易还很让人开心。当她以为自己要打败我的时候，我便转过身来，微笑着跟她四目相对，眼里充满了鄙视，看到她流露出无声的羞耻的神色，真是大快人心。可她依旧不肯罢休；最后，我不得不承认，她用尽了一切办法终于触碰到了我内心的那个秘密弹簧；不一会，盒盖砰地一声打开了。她伸手去拿里面的珠宝。她把珠宝偷去摔碎了，还是又合上了盖子，还是差点夹到她的手指，往下读，你就会知道了。","Amidst this assemblage of all that was insignificant and defective, much that was vicious and repulsive (by that last epithet many would have described the two or three stiff, silent, decently behaved, ill-dressed British girls), the sensible, sagacious, affable directness shone like a steady star over a marsh full of jack-o’-lanthorns.Profoundly aware of her superiority, she derived an inward bliss from that consciousness which sustained her under all the care and responsibility inseparable from her position; it kept her temper calm, her brow smooth, her manner tranquil.She liked—as who would not?—on entering the schoolroom, to feel that her sole presence sufficed to diffuse that order and quiet which all the remonstrances, and even commands, of her underlings frequently failed to enforce.She liked to stand in comparison or rather contrast, with those who surrounded her, and to know that in personal as well as mental advantages she bore away the undisputed palm of preference (the three teachers were all plain).Her pupils she managed with such indulgence and address—taking always on herself the office of recompenser and eulogist, and abandoning to her subalterns every invidious task of blame and punishment—that they all regarded her with deference, if not with affection.Her teachers did not love her, but they submitted because they were her inferiors in everything.The various masters who attended her school were each and all in some way or other under her influence.Over one she had acquired power by her skilful management of his bad temper; over another by little attentions to his petty caprices; a third she had subdued by flattery; a fourth—a timid man—she kept in awe by a sort of austere decision of mien; me she still watched, still tried by the most ingenious tests.She roved round me, baffled yet persevering, I believe she thought I was like a smooth and bare precipice, which offered neither jutting stone nor tree-root nor tuft of grass to aid the climber.Now she flattered with exquisite tact; now she moralized; now she tried how far I was accessible to mercenary motives; then she disported on the brink of affection, knowing that some men are won by weakness; anon, she talked excellent sense, aware that others have the folly to admire judgment.I found it at once pleasant and easy to evade all these efforts.It was sweet, when she thought me nearly won, to turn round and to smile in her very eyes, half scornfully, and then to witness her scarcely veiled though mute mortification.Still she persevered, and at last, I am bound to confess it, her finger, essaying, proving every atom of the casket, touched its secret spring, and for a moment the lid sprang open.She laid her hand on the jewel within.Whether she stole and broke it, or whether the lid shut again with a snap on her fingers, read on, and you shall know."
"很碰巧，有一天我去上课，还是带病去的。我得了重感冒，还咳嗽。连续两个小时的讲课让我的嗓子变得非常沙哑，人也很疲劳。我离开教室顺着走廊走时，碰到了勒泰小姐。她焦虑地说我看上去脸色苍白，身心疲倦。“是的，”我说，“我快虚脱了。”她听了便更加关心地说：“你得进来休息一下再走。”她说服我进了客厅，对我真是和善又温柔。第二天，她对我更好了。她亲自到教室来查看窗户是否都关紧了，确定没有风跑进来，而且还友好并真诚地劝我别太拼命了。我离开时，她又主动伸出手来；出于尊重和礼貌，我只好说我明白并且十分感激她对我的关心。听到我这么庄重的感谢，她脸上露出了一丝高兴的微笑。这让我觉得她有点迷人。整整那晚的后半夜，我都焦躁不安，盼望着第二天下午的到来，那样我就能再见到她了。","It happened that I came one day to give a lesson when I was indisposed.I had a bad cold and a cough.Two hours‘ incessant talking left me very hoarse and tired.As I quitted the schoolroom, and was passing along the corridor, I met Mdlle. Reuter. She remarked, with an anxious air, that I looked very pale and tired.‘Yes,’ I said, ‘I was fatigued.’  And then, with increased interest, she rejoined, ‘You shall not go away till you have had some refreshment.’She persuaded me to step into the parlour, and was very kind and gentle while I stayed.The next day she was kinder still.She came herself into the class to see that the windows were closed, and that there was no draught; she exhorted me with friendly earnestness not to overexert myself.When I went away, she gave me her hand unasked, and I could not but mark, by a respectful and gentle pressure, that I was sensible of the favour, and grateful for it. My modest demonstration kindled a little merry smile on her countenance; I thought her almost charming.During the remainder of the evening my mind was full of impatience for the afternoon of the next day to arrive, that I might see her again."
"如我所愿，就在我上第二节课时，她一直坐在教室里，几乎时时面带爱意地注视着我。四点钟的时候她跟我一起离开了教室，还一边担忧地关心着我的健康状况；接着又娇嗔地责备我，因为我说话声音太大，给自己带来诸多麻烦。在那个通向花园的玻璃门口我停下了脚步，听她把话讲完；门是打开的，能看到外面的天空万里无云；我边听着她那让人安慰的训斥，边欣赏着外面的阳光和鲜花，心情好极了。走读生们开始潮水般地涌出教室，挤到那条通道上。","I was not disappointed, for she sat in the class during the whole of my subsequent lesson, and often looked at me almost with affection.At four o’clock she accompanied me out of the schoolroom, asking with solicitude after my health, then scolding me sweetly because I spoke too loud and gave myself too much trouble.I stopped at the glass door which led into the garden, to hear her lecture to the end. The door was open; it was a very fine day; and while I listened to the soothing reprimand, I looked at the sunshine and flowers, and felt very happy.The day-scholars began to pour from the schoolrooms into the passage."
"“要不要去花园里呆一两分钟，”她问我，“等他们都走完了？”","‘Will you go into the garden a minute or two,’ asked she, ‘till they are gone?’"
"我没吭声便下了台阶，但当我头去看时，差不多是在说：","I descended the steps without answering, but I looked back, as much as to say,—"
"“要跟我一起来吗？”","‘You will come with me?’"
"很快，我就和校长并肩走在两旁栽着果树的小路上，那些果树花朵盛开，绿叶舒展。天色蔚蓝，空气宁静。五月的午后阳光明媚，香气四溢。逃离了沉闷的教室，徜徉于鲜花和绿叶中，有宜人微笑，面容可人的女子相伴，那该是何等感受呢？啊，真是太令人羡慕了！就好像那块让人嫉妒的木板把花园挡住的时候，我对它的种种浪漫的想象现在已经全部变成现实；我们拐了一个弯，房子就看不见了，珀莱先生的小楼也被一些高大的灌木挡住了；一时间，其它所有房子也都被遮挡了，犹如高高的圆形剧场包围着这一小块绿地，我把手伸向勒泰小姐，牵引她来到植有紫丁香树的园子的椅子边。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    她坐了下来，我在她身旁坐下。她继续放松地对我滔滔不绝说着，听着听着我忽然意识到我就快要陷入情网了。这时，她家和珀莱家的晚饭钟声同时响起。我们才不得不相互道别。正当她要走开的时候，我拦住了她。","In another minute I and the directness were walking side by side down the alley bordered with fruit-trees, whose white blossoms were then in full blow as well as their tender green leaves.The sky was blue, the air still; the May afternoon was full of brightness and fragrance.Released from the stifling class, surrounded with flowers and foliage, with a pleasing, smiling, affable woman at my side, how did I feel?Why, very enviably.It seemed as if the romantic visions my imagination had suggested of this garden, while it was yet hidden from me by the jealous boards, were more than realized; and when a turn in the alley shut out the view of the house, and some tall shrubs excluded M. Pelet’s mansion, and screened us momentarily from the other houses rising amphitheatre-like round this green spot, I gave my arm to Mdlle. Reuter, and led her to a garden-chair, nestled under some lilacs near.She sat down; I took my place at her side.She went on talking to me with that ease which communicates case, and as I listened a revelation dawned in my mind that I was on the brink of falling in love.The dinner-bell rang, both at her house and M. Pelet’s. We were obliged to part.I detained her a moment as she was moving away."
"“我想要点东西。”我说。","‘I want something,’ said I."
"“什么？”佐蕾德天真地问道。","‘What?’ asked Zoraïde naively."
"“就一朵花。”","‘Only a flower.’"
"“那就摘一朵呗——想要的话，两朵、二十朵也行。”","‘Gather it, then—or two, or twenty, if you like.’"
"“不，一朵就行。你去摘，再送给我。”","‘No, one will do; but you must gather it, and give it to me.’"
"“真是个怪人！”她大声说。但还是踮起脚尖摘了一枝美丽的紫丁香，优雅地送给我。我接过花便离开了，暂时是满足了，却更期待未来。","‘What a caprice!’ she exclaimed; but she raised herself on her tiptoes, and, plucking a beautiful branch of lilac, offered it to me with grace.I took it, and went away, satisfied for the present and hopeful for the future."
"诚然，那五月的一天是个可爱的日子，那天结束在温暖宁静的夏日月光里。我记得很清楚，因为那天晚上我熬夜批改作业，觉得疲倦，待在小屋里又憋得慌，便推开了我常常提到的那个钉着木板的窗子；那块木板，从我就职那天起就要求勒泰老夫人把它卸掉，因为对我来说，俯看我自己的学生在游戏场上玩耍，已不再有什么不方便了。                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   我在靠窗的位置坐下，胳膊支着窗台，身子向外倾斜着。我头顶上是一片晴朗无云的夜空；如水的月色让周围的星光都黯淡了；楼下的花园银光和暗影交替出现，在露水的清洗下，一切显得那么清新；果树上闭合的花朵散发出阵阵芳香，空气中一丝风没有，树枝也静止不动。                 从我的窗口俯瞰下去就是勒泰小姐花园的某条小路。那条小路叫做禁行道——这么给它命名是不许女学生步入，因为附近就是男子学校。在这儿，紫丁香和金链花长得尤其繁茂。这里是园中最隐蔽的角落，灌木丛挡住了那天下午我和年轻女校长坐过的那把花园长椅。我倚靠在窗棂上，眼睛漫无目的地游走，一会看看花园的小路和围栏，一会瞧瞧座落于繁枝绿叶之中的那座多窗的白色小屋的正面；可想而知，我心里一直惦念着她。我猜想着她的公寓到底在这栋房子的那个位置，一盏孤灯从一个百叶窗里射出了光亮，似乎在指引着我。","Certainly that May day was a lovely one, and it closed in a moonlight night of summer warmth and serenity.I remember this well, for, having sat up late that evening, correcting devoirs, and feeling weary and a little oppressed with the closeness of my small room, I opened the often-mentioned boarded window, whose boards, however, I had persuaded old Madame Pelet to have removed since I had filled the post of professor in the pensionnat de demoiselles, as from that time it was no longer ‘inconvenient’ for me to overlook my own pupils at their sports.I sat down in the window seat, rested my arm on the sill, and leaned out. Above me was the clear-obscure of a cloudless night sky; splendid moonlight subdued the tremulous sparkle of the stars; below lay the garden, varied with silvery lustre and deep shade, and all fresh with dew; a grateful perfume exhaled from the closed blossoms of the fruit-trees; not a leaf stirred; the night was breezeless.My window looked directly down upon a certain walk of Mdlle. Reuter’s garden, called l’allée défendue—so named because the pupils were forbidden to enter it on account of its proximity to the boys’ school.It was here that the lilacs and laburnums grew especially thick.This was the most sheltered nook in the enclosure; its shrubs screened the garden-chair where that afternoon I had sat with the young directness.I need not say that my thoughts were chiefly with her as I leaned from the lattice, and let my eye roam, now over the walks and borders of the garden, now along the many-windowed front of the house which rose white beyond the masses of foliage.I wondered in what part of the building was situated her apartment; and a single light, shining through the persiennes of one croisée, seemed to direct me to it."
"“她看书看到太晚了。”我暗想，因为现在肯定接近午夜了。“她真是位迷人的小女人。”我心里默默地自言自语，“在我记忆中，她的肖像就是一幅宜人的画卷。我知道，她不是那种世人称道的美人。但这不重要。我喜欢她骨子里散发出来的那种和谐感。棕色的头发，蓝色的眼睛，白嫩的脸蛋，雪白的颈部，全都是符合我的品位。还有，我钦佩她的才能。娶一个洋娃娃或傻瓜当老婆这样的想法，总是让我很反感。我知道，要是度蜜月找一个可爱的洋娃娃或漂亮的傻瓜一起去还不错，但是当激情褪去，发现自己胸口躺着的竟是一块蜡烛或木头，怀里搂着的竟是半个白痴，才想起自己竟选择这样的人做老婆——不，我的偶像——知道自己余下的宝贵生命必须跟这样一个听不懂我的语言、猜不透我的心思以及不能与我的感情产生共鸣的东西一起度过，该是多么可怕的一件事啊！　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　“然而，佐蕾德·勒泰，”我认为，“是个有智慧、有个性、有判断力以及有辨别力的人。她有爱心吗？她送给我那枝紫丁香的时候，嘴唇上的微笑多么简单美好！之前我以为她个性圆滑、虚伪、贪恋，这些都没错。但是她所表现出的那些圆滑和虚伪会不会只是因为她想用温和的态度来把复杂的困难简单化呢？至于说利害关系，那是因为她想在这个世界上立足，毫无疑问，这无可厚非。即便她真的在道德方面有缺失，难道不能说是她的不幸，非要责怪于她吗？她从小就在一个天主教家庭里长大。如果她出生在英国，被培养成一名新教徒，难道除了其他的优秀品质之外，不会再加上正直吗？倘若她未来的丈夫是名英国新教徒，像她这么理智聪慧的人，难道不能很快认识到权力胜于权术，正直胜于阴谋吗？我看，追求她是一件很值得男人去做的事。明天我要重新对她做一番观察。她知道我在注意她。仔细看去，她是多么娴静啊！她似乎非但不恼怒，还很开心。”这时，有一阵弦乐飘进我的耳朵，打断了我的思绪。是一阵吹奏得非常娴熟的小号声，我想，应该是从花园的隔壁，或者是从皇家广场传来的。如此优美之曲调，如此沉静之时刻；此时万籁俱寂，月色宁静，我停止了思索，这样我方能听得更加专注。那音乐声越来越弱，很快便消逝了。我的思绪将再次驻足于午夜绝对的宁静。不行。一阵低语声快使我想要宁静的期望破灭了；那低沉，不远而且还在迫近的声音到底是什么呢？原来是有人在交谈——没错，太明显了，一阵压低的但仍可听见的说话声从我正下方的花园里传来。另一个声音在回答。前一个是男人的声音，后一个是女人的；我还看见一男一女正沿着小路漫步走来。本来他们的身形被阴影遮住了——我只能辨认出他们的轮廓；然而，走到小路尽头，一束月光就刚好落在他们身上；等他们正好走到我的鼻子底下，我才清楚无疑地辨认出，那是佐蕾德·勒泰小姐和我的校长、密友、良师弗朗索瓦·珀莱先生臂挽着臂，或手拉着手（我忘了是怎么样了）。只听珀莱先生说：","‘She watches late,’ thought I, for it must be now near midnight.‘She is a fascinating little woman,’ I continued in voiceless soliloquy; ‘her image forms a pleasant picture in memory.I know she is not what the world calls pretty.No matter; there is harmony in her aspect, and I like it.Her brown hair, her blue eye, the freshness of her cheek, the whiteness of her neck, all suit my taste.Then I respect her talent.The idea of marrying a doll or a fool was always abhorrent to me.I know that a pretty doll, a fair fool, might do well enough for the honeymoon; but when passion cooled, how dreadful to find a lump of wax and wood laid in my bosom a half idiot clasped in try arms, and to remember that I had made of this my equal—nay, my idol—to know that I must pass the rest of my dreary life with a creature incapable of understanding what I said, of appreciating what I thought, or of sympathizing with what I felt!‘Now, Zoraïde  Reuter,’ thought I, ‘has tact, caractère, judgment, discretion.Has she heart?What a good, simple little smile played about her lips when she gave me the branch of lilacs!I have thought her crafty, dissembling, interested sometimes, it is true; but may not much that looks like cunning and dissimulation in her conduct be only the efforts made by a bland temper to traverse quietly perplexing difficulties?And as to interest, she wishes to make her way in the world, no doubt, and who can blame her?Even if she be truly deficient in sound principle, is it not rather her misfortune than her fault?She has been brought up a Catholic.Had she been born an Englishwoman, and reared a Protestant, might she not have added straight integrity to all her other excellences?Supposing she were to marry an English and Protestant husband, would she not, rational, sensible as she is, quickly acknowledge the superiority of right over expediency, honesty over policy?It would be worth a man’s while to try the experiment.To-morrow I will renew my observations.She knows that I watch her.How calm she is under scrutiny!It seems rather to gratify than annoy her.’ Here a strain of music stole in upon my monologue, and suspended it.It was a bugle, very skilfully played, in the neighbourhood of the park, I thought, or on the Place Royale.So sweet were the tones, so subduing their effect at that hour, in the midst of silence and under the quiet reign of moonlight I ceased to think, that I might listen more intently.The strain retreated, its sound waxed fainter and was soon gone.My car prepared to repose on the absolute hush of midnight once more.No. What murmur was that which, low, and yet near and approaching nearer, frustrated the expectation of total silence?It was some one conversing—yes, evidently, an audible though subdued voice spoke in the garden immediately below me.Another answered.The first voice was that of a man, the second that of a woman; and a man and a woman I saw coming slowly down the alley.Their forms were at first in shade—I could but discern a dusk outline of each; but a ray of moonlight met them at the termination of the walk, when they were under my very nose, and revealed very plainly, very unequivocally, Mdlle. Zoraïde Reuter, arm-in-arm, or hand-in-hand (I forget which) with my principal, confidant, and counsellor, M. François Pelet.And M. Pelet was saying,—"
"“亲爱的，我们到底要等到哪一天才结婚啊？“","‘A quand done le jour des noces, ma bien-aimée?’"
"勒泰小姐回答说：","And Mdlle. Reuter answered,—"
"“但是，弗朗索瓦，你很清楚，暑假之前我是不可能结婚的。”","‘Mais, François, tu sais bien qu’il me serait impossible de me marier avant les vacances."
"“六月、七月、八月——可是一整个季度啊！”珀莱先生叫道。“我怎么等得了那么久——我甚至都准备好急死在你的脚下了？“","‘June, July, August—a whole quarter!’ exclaimed the director.‘How can I wait so long—I who am ready even now to expire at your feet with impatience?’"
"“啊！你要是死了，一切就好办了。什么公证呀、合同呀，所有麻烦都省了。我只需订做一套丧服，这可比做一套嫁妆要快得多了。”","‘Ah!if you die, the whole affair will be settled without any trouble about notaries and contracts.I shall only have to order a slight mourning dress, which will be much sooner prepared than the nuptial trousseau.’"
"“佐蕾德，你真是可恶！我这样全心全意地爱着你，你倒拿我的痛苦开涮；难道看我受折磨你很快乐？你毫无顾忌地使我的灵魂深受嫉妒之苦；我敢肯定地说，即便你会极力否认，你已经给过那个书呆子克利姆斯沃斯鼓励的眼神。他觉得自己已经坠入情网了，要不是你给他遐想的空间，他敢这样想吗？”","‘Cruel Zoraïde!you laugh at the distress of one who loves you so devotedly as I do; my torment is your sport.You scruple not to stretch my soul on the rack of jealousy; for, deny it as you will, I am certain you have cast encouraging glances on that schoolboy Crimsworth.He has presumed to fall in love, which he dared not have done unless you had given him room to hope.’"
"“你说什么，弗朗索瓦？你的意思是克利姆斯沃斯爱上我了？”","‘What do you say, Français?Do you say Crimsworth is in love with me?’"
"“已经深陷其中了。”","‘Over head and ears.’"
"“他这么跟你说的？”","‘Has he told you so?’"
"“不是；但是从他的脸上可以看出，因为只要一提到你的名字他就脸红。”","‘No; but I see it in his face, He blushes whenever your name is mentioned.’"
"勒泰小姐那愉快的小声媚笑表明她对珀莱的这份情报十分感激（顺便说一下，这其实是一个谎言。毕竟我对她的喜欢还没到那种程度）。珀莱先生又问她打算怎么对付我，并相当明显、但并不很勇敢地对她暗示道，这样一个小白脸并不是做丈夫的明智选择，因为她肯定比我至少要大十岁。（这么说，她已经三十二岁啦？我真没想到。）我听到她对于这样的意图一概不承认。然而，珀莱先生还在逼迫她，希望她能确切地回答他。","A little laugh of exulting coquetry announced Mdlle. Reuter’s gratification at this piece of intelligence (which was a lie, by-the-bye; I had never been so far gone as that, after all).M. Pelet proceeded to ask what she intended to do with me, intimating pretty plainly, and not very gallantly, that it was nonsense for her to think of taking such a blanc-bec as a husband, since she must be at least ten years older than I.(Was she then thirty-two?I should not have thought it.)I heard her disclaim any intentions on the subject.The director, however, still pressed her to give a definite answer."
"“弗朗索瓦，”她说，“你吃醋了。”她还在笑。接着，好像突然想起这种媚态跟她希望展现的那种端庄、高贵的性格不相符，就用一种严肃的口吻继续道：“的确，亲爱的弗朗索瓦，我承认这位英国小伙子或许一直努力向我献殷勤，而我也尽量谨慎而又不失礼貌地对待他，所以根本说不上我给了他什么希望。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　既然我们已经订婚了，我不会给任何男人任何空想的机会，亲爱的，相信我。”","‘Français,’ said she, ‘you are jealous.’ And still she laughed.Then, as if suddenly recollecting that this coquetry was not consistent with the character for modest dignity she wished to establish, she proceeded, in a demure voice, ‘Truly, my dear FranÃ§ois, I will not deny that this young Englishman may have made some attempts to ingratiate himself with me; but so far from giving him any encouragement, I have always treated him with as much reserve as it was possible to combine with civility.Affianced as I am to you, I would give no man false hopes, believe me, dear friend.’"
"珀莱还在怀疑地咕咕哝哝——至少从她的回答来看是这样的。","Still Pelet uttered murmurs of distrust—so I judged at least, from her reply."
"“真是个傻瓜！我怎么会放弃你而选择一个我并不了解的外国人呢？而且——这可不是奉承话——克利姆斯沃斯无不管是才干和相貌，都是不能拿来跟你相提并论的。他长得一点也不英俊。也许还有人会说他举止绅士、长相聪慧，但对我来说——”","‘What folly!How could I prefer an unknown foreigner to you?And then—not to flatter your vanity—Crimsworth could not bear comparison with you either physically or mentally; he is not a handsome man at all. Some may call him gentlemanlike and intelligent-looking, but for my part—’"
"随着他们从刚刚坐过的椅子上站起来，越走越远，后面的话我就没有听见了。我在等着他们回来，但是很快就听到一阵开门和关门的声音，我知道，他们又回到房子里去了。我又听了一会，全然宁静。我听了一个多钟头。最后，听见珀莱进门上楼回他自己的房间去了。我再次扫视了一遍花园房子那长长的正面，最后看见那盏孤灯终于熄灭了；在那一刹那，爱情与友谊的信念也随之破灭了。我上床睡觉，然而血液中有股热气让我感到灼热难耐，致使我一整晚都难以入眠。","The rest of the sentence was lost in the distance, as the pair, rising from the chair in which they had been seated, moved away.I waited their return, but soon the opening and shutting of a door informed me that they had re-entered the house.I listened a little longer; all was perfectly still.I listened more than an hour.At last I heard M. Pelet come in and ascend to his chamber.Glancing once more towards the long front of the garden-house, I perceived that its solitary light was at length extinguished; so, for a time, was my faith in love and friendship.I went to bed, but something feverish and fiery had got into my veins which prevented me from sleeping much that night."
"第十三章","CHAPTER XIII"
"次日清晨，破晓时分我就起来了。我穿好衣服，手肘靠在衣橱上，站了半个小时，思索着该用什么方法才能打起精神，像往日一样，失眠已经让我精疲力竭——我没打算与珀莱先生吵架，责备他背信弃义，向他提出挑战或者搞出其他类似的恶作剧——后来我忽然想到一个好办法，早晨清爽宜人，我该到附近的浴场好好洗个澡，提提神。这个补救办法果真取得了理想的效果。我七点钟返回时，情绪已经稳定下来，也精神多了。珀莱先生进来吃早餐时，我也能带着一贯平静的表情招呼他了。我甚至热情地伸出手来，还用亲切的语气同他说话；他习惯于用这种语气跟我说话，尤其是最近，他讨好地称呼我为“我的孩子”时，就是这腔调。我外表丝毫没有表现出什么，但是内心仍旧有些气愤，尽管这种感觉已消减了许多。并不是我怀着报复之心——不是；然而那种遭遇侮辱和背叛的感觉依然在我心里，就像可引燃的煤火一样，虽然现在它被闷灭了。上帝知道我不是生来就具有报复性，不会因为不能再相信或者喜欢一个人而去伤害他；然而我的理智和情感都不会摇摆不定——它们不似沙子那样，迅速留下痕迹，还能同样迅速地抹去。一旦确信朋友的性情与我的性情难以相容，一旦知道他沾染了某些恶习，违背了我的原则，并难以改掉，我会结束这种朋友关系。对于爱德华，我就是这样做的。对于珀莱先生，我才刚刚发现这点。我应该也这么对他吗？我用半个奶油面包搅拌杯子里的咖啡（我们从不用勺子）时，脑子里思索的正是这个问题。与此同时，珀莱先生正坐在对面，苍白的脸看起来与平时一样睿智，但也比平时更加憔悴。他转动着一双蓝眼睛，时而严厉地看着他的男仆和使者，时而温和地看着我。","Next morning I rose with the dawn, and having dressed myself and stood half an hour, my elbow leaning on the chest of drawers, considering what means I should adopt to restore my spirits, fagged with sleeplessness, to their ordinary tone—for I had no intention of getting up a scene with M. Pelet, reproaching him with perfidy, sending him a challenge, or performing other gambadoes of the sort—I hit at last on the expedient of walking out in the cool of the morning to a neighbouring establishment of baths, and treating myself to a bracing plunge.The remedy produced the desired effect.I came back at seven o’clock steadied and invigorated, and was able to greet M. Pelet when he entered to breakfast with an unchanged and tranquil countenance.Even a cordial offering of the hand and the flattering appellation of ‘mon fils,’ pronounced in that caressing tone with which monsieur had, of late days especially, been accustomed to address me, did not elicit any external sign of the feeling which, though subdued, still glowed at my heart.Not that I nursed vengeance—no; but the sense of insult and treachery lived in me like a kindling, though as yet smothered, coal.God knows I am not by nature vindictive; I would not hurt a man because I can no longer trust or like him; but neither my reason nor feelings are of the vacillating order—they are not of that sand-like sort where impressions, if soon made, are as soon effaced.Once convinced that my friend’s disposition is incompatible with my own, once assured that he is indelibly stained with certain defects obnoxious to my principles, and I dissolve the connection.I did so with Edward.As to Pelet, the discovery was yet new. Should I act thus with him?Should I act thus with him?It was the question I placed before my mind as I stirred my cup of coffee with a half pistolet (we never had spoons), Pelet meantime being seated opposite, his pallid face looking as knowing and more haggard than usual, his blue eye turned, now sternly on his boys and ushers, and now graciously on me."
"“命运必定在指引我。”我暗自说道；碰上珀莱先生虚假的瞥视和谄媚的微笑时，我感谢上天让我昨晚打开了窗户，借着满月的光，明白了那狡诈表情真正的意思。我觉得自己是他的半个主人，因为现在我知道他的本性。尽管他对人微笑、恭维，但我看到了他微笑背后隐藏的灵魂，从他的每一句花言巧语中听出一种声音，这声音让我领会到他不怀好意。","‘Circumstances must guide me,’ said I; and meeting Pelet’s false glance and insinuating smile, I thanked Heaven that I had last night opened my window and read by the light of a full moon the true meaning of that guileful countenance.I felt half his master, because the reality of his nature was now known to me. Smile and flatter as he would, I saw his soul lurk behind his smile, and heard in every one of his smooth phrases a voice interpreting their treacherous import."
"可是佐蕾德·勒泰小姐呢？当然，她的背叛深深地伤害了我的感情？这伤痛钻得太深，任何富于哲理的安慰都不能消除这伤痛？根本不是这样。夜里的高烧退去，我四处寻求治疗创伤的膏药，却找到了比吉利厄德更近的家园。理智就是我的医生。她开始向我证明我所失去的奖品毫无价值。她承认，肉体上佐蕾德可能会适合我。然而她断言我们的心灵无法和谐共处，那种不合必定源自两人思想的结合。然后她坚持要我停止一切抱怨和牢骚，命令我反而应该高兴起来，因为我躲过了一个陷阱。她的药对我很有益处。次日再遇到女校长，我感受到了这药的巩固疗效。它严格地地作用于我的神经，我没有颤抖，没有踌躇；它让我坚定地面对她，让我从容走过她身边。她向我伸出手，而我选择视而不见。她用妩媚的微笑向我打招呼，而我的心丝毫不为所动。我继续走，一直来到了讲台上，她跟在后面。她的眼睛盯住我的脸。她要从我面貌的每个细节中弄明白我态度变冷漠的真正含义。“我会给她一个答复。”我这样想着，眼睛与她注视的目光撞个正着，我捕捉并盯住她的目光。从我眼里投向她的目光没有尊重，没有爱意，没有温柔，没有殷勤；再缜密的分析也只能发现鄙夷、刚毅和嘲讽。我要让她感受并忍受这种目光。她沉稳的表情没有改变，但脸色变红了，她像着了迷似的走近我。她走上讲台，站在我身旁；她没什么可说的。我不会为她缓解这种尴尬局面，便若无其事地翻起一本书来。","But Zoraïde Reuter?Of course her defection had cut me to the quick?That sting must have gone too deep for any consolations of philosophy to be available in curing its smart?Not at all.The night fever over, I looked about for balm to that wound also, and found some nearer home than at Gilead.Reason was my physician.She began by proving that the prize I had missed was of little value.She admitted that, physically, Zoraïde might have suited me, but affirmed that our souls were not in harmony, and that discord must have resulted from the union of her mind with mine.She then insisted on the suppression of all repining, and commanded me rather to rejoice that I had escaped a snare.Her medicament did me good.I felt its strengthening effect when I met the directress the next day.Its stringent operation on the nerves suffered no trembling, no faltering; it enabled me to face her with firmness, to pass her with case.She had held out her hand to me that I did not choose to see.She had greeted me with a charming smile; it fell on my heart like light on stone.I passed on to the estrade; she followed me.Her eye, fastened on my face, demanded of every feature the meaning of my changed and careless manner.‘I will give her an answer,’ thought I; and meeting her gaze full, arresting, fixing her glance, I shot into her eyes from my own a look where there was no respect, no love, no tenderness, no gallantry, where the strictest analysis could detect nothing but scorn, hardihood, irony.I made her bear it and feel it.Her steady countenance did not change, but her colour rose, and she approached me as if fascinated.She stepped on to the estrade, and stood close by my side; she had nothing to say.I would not relieve her embarrassment, and negligently turned over the leaves of a book."
"“希望你今天恢复得好多了。”最终她用低沉的语调说道。","‘I hope you feel quite recovered today,’ at last she said, in a low tone."
"“我呢，倒是希望小姐你昨晚没有因为大半夜的在花园里散步而着凉。”","‘And I, mademoiselle, hope that you took no cold last night in consequence of your late walk in the garden.’"
"她理解得很快，即刻明白了我的意思。她的脸色变得有些苍白——稍稍白了一点而已——然而她分明的五官上的肌肉没有为之动一下；她很镇静从容地从讲台上退下来，静静地在一个离讲台不远的座位上坐下，忙着织起钱包来。我接着讲课。这是一节“作文”课——也就是，我口述一些一般问句，学生根据记忆将答案组成一篇文章，禁止看书。","Quick enough of comprehension, she understood me directly.Her face became a little blanched—a very little—but no muscle in her rather marked features moved; and, calm and self-possessed, she retired from the estrade, taking her seat quietly at a little distance, and occupying herself with netting a purse.I proceeded to give my lesson.It was a ‘composition’—that is, I dictated certain general questions, of which the pupils were to compose the answers from memory access to books being forbidden."
"当厄拉利、奥尔唐斯、卡罗琳等人正思考着我所提出的一系列艰深的语法问题时，我可以随意地利用这半小时的闲暇时间，更进一步地观察女校长。她快速地织着手中的绿色丝织钱包。她的眼睛注视着钱包，态度平静而警觉，因为她坐着织钱包的地方离我只有两码距离。她整个人清楚地同时表现出一种安详和警觉，这两者的结合很罕见。就像从前一样，我这样看着她，就会不由自主地对她良好的判断力和令人惊叹的自制力感到钦佩。她觉察到我已经收回了对她的尊重，她从我的眼睛里看到了轻蔑和冷漠，对她这样一个贪求身边所有人的赞扬，渴望博得一致好评的人来讲，这发现一定是种严重的伤害。她脸颊上片刻的苍白让我目睹了这一发现的效果——她的面色是不易改变的，但她的自制力又多么迅速地让她恢复了沉着！她几乎就坐在我旁边，健全而又有力的心智支持着她，她此刻显得平静而又威严——稍长而机敏的上唇没有一丝颤抖，皱起的眉头上也看不出一点怯懦和愧疚。","While Mdlles. Eulalie, Hortense, Caroline, etc., were pondering over the string of rather abstruse grammatical interrogatories I had propounded, I was at liberty to employ the vacant half-hour in further observing the directress herself.The green silk purse was progressing fast in her hands.Her eyes were bent upon it; her attitude, as she sat netting within two yards of me, was still yet guarded.In her whole person were expressed at once, and with equal clearness, vigilance, and repose a rare union.Looking at her, I was forced, as I had often been before, to offer her good sense, her wondrous self-control, the tribute of involuntary admiration.She had felt that I had withdrawn from her my esteem; she had seen contempt and coldness in my eye; and to her, who coveted the approbation of all around her, who thirsted after universal good opinion, such discovery must have been an acute wound.I had witnessed its effect in the momentary pallor of her cheek—cheek unused to vary; yet how quickly, by dint of self-control, had she recovered her composure!With what quiet dignity she now sat, almost at my side, sustained by her sound and vigorous sense—no trembling in her somewhat lengthened though shrewd upper lip, no coward shame on her austere forehead!"
"“她头脑里有块金属。”我盯着她，自言自语道，“要是那里面还有火，那高温会把钢铁也烧红！那么我可能会爱她。”","‘There is metal there,’ I said as I gazed.‘Would that there were fire also, living ardour to make the steel glow!Then I could love her.’"
"不一会儿我发觉她知道我在看她，因为她身体动也不动，狡黠的眼皮抬也不抬。她的眼睛顺着正在织的钱包上看下去，透过紫色精纺长袍柔和的褶皱，瞧了瞧她小巧的脚；之后她的目光又移回手上，她的手像象牙一般白皙，食指上戴着一枚闪亮的石榴红戒指，手腕上系着一条打着小褶的蕾丝花边饰带。她转过头来，动作简直让人难以察觉，栗色的发卷随之优雅地摆动。从这些细微的迹象中，我看懂了她内心的愿望和脑中的打算，她想把曾经吓走的猎物引诱回来。一件小事让她有了再次和我说话的机会。","Presently I discovered that she knew I was watching her, for she stirred not, she lifted not her crafty eyelid.She had glanced down from her netting to her small foot, peeping from the soft folds of her purple merino gown; thence her eye reverted to her hand, ivory white, with a bright garnet ring on the forefinger, and a light frill of lace round the wrist.With a scarcely perceptible movement she turned her head, causing her nut-brown curls to wave gracefully.In these slight signs I read that the wish of her heart, the design of her brain, was to lure back the game she had scared.A little incident gave her the opportunity of addressing me again."
"当教室里正鸦雀无声时——安静得只有学生们翻练习本和钢笔书写在纸张上的沙沙声——通向门厅的大折叠门的一扇打开了，进来一个学生，匆匆行了个礼，坐在了离门最近的一个空位上。她神情有些不安，或许是因为来得太迟了。坐下来后，她依旧用一副慌张、尴尬的神情打开手提包，拿出课本。我在等她抬起脸来，好认出她是谁——因为我是近视，她进来时我没认出是谁。勒泰小姐离开座位，向讲台走来。","While all was silence in the class—silence but for the rustling of copy-books and the travelling of pens over their pages—a leaf of the large folding-door, opening from the hall, unclosed, admitting a pupil who, after making a hasty obeisance, ensconced herself, with some appearance of trepidation, probably occasioned by her entering so late, in a vacant seat at the desk nearest the door.Being seated, she proceeded, still with an air of hurry and embarrassment, to open her cabas, to take out her books; and while I was waiting for her to look up, in order to make out her identity—for, short-sighted as I was, I had not recognized her at her entrance—Mdlle. Reuter, leaving her chair, approached the estrade."
"“克里姆斯沃先生，”她小声说道，教室里一片寂静，女校长总是把脚步放得很轻，说话的声音也很小，以身作则地极力维护着课堂秩序和教室安静，“克里姆斯沃先生，刚刚进来的那个年轻人希望可以在您的课上跟您学英语。她不是这所学校的学生。实际上，从某种意义上来说，她是个老师，她指导学生们缝补花边，做一些装饰用的针线活之类的。她提出合理要求，想要提升自己以胜任更高层的教学工作，她还请求我们允许她上您的课，以提高自己的英文水平。我觉得她的英语已经有进步了。当然帮助她只是我的个人愿望。她付出的努力值得称道。您会允许的，而且您会帮助她，给她指导——是吧，先生？”勒泰小姐抬眼望着我，眼神一下子变得天真、温和、恳切。","‘Monsieur Creemsvort,’ said she, in a whisper, for when the schoolrooms were silent the directness always moved with velvet tread, and spoke in the most subdued key, enforcing order and stillness fully as much by example as precept—‘Monsieur Creemsvort, that young person who has just entered wishes to have the advantage of taking lessons with you in English.She is not a pupil of the house; she is, indeed, in one sense, a teacher, for she gives instruction in lace-mending and in little varieties of ornamental needlework.She very properly proposes to qualify herself for a higher department of education, and has asked permission to attend your lessons, in order to perfect her knowledge of English, in which language she has, I believe, already made some progress.Of course it is my wish to aid her in an effort so praiseworthy.You will permit her, then, to benefit by your instruction—n’est-ce pas, monsieur?’ And Mdlle Reuter’s eyes were raised to mine with a look at once naive, benign, and beseeching."
"“当然。”我用几乎生硬的语气简单答道。","I replied, ‘Of course,’ very laconically, almost abruptly."
"“另外，”她轻柔地说道，“亨利小姐没有接受过正规教育。也许她的天分不是最高的，但我可以向你保证，她的动机良好，性格也随和。我确信先生刚开始会为她考虑周到，不会在这些年轻的女孩子面前暴露她的落后和一些难免的不足之处，因为从某种意义上说，这些女孩子都是她的学生。克里姆斯沃先生，您愿意帮我个忙，听取这个建议吗？”","‘Another word,’ she said, with softness.‘Mdlle. Henri has not received a regular education.Perhaps her natural talents are not of the highest order, but I can assure you of the excellence of her intentions, and even of the amiability of her disposition.Monsieur will then, I am sure, have the goodness to be considerate with her at first, and not expose her backwardness, her inevitable deficiencies, before the young ladies, who, in a sense, are her pupils.Will Monsieur Creemsvort favour me by attending to this hint?’"
"我点了点头。她继续镇静而恳切地说道:","I nodded.She continued with subdued earnestness,—"
"“先生，请恕我冒昧地再加一句，我刚才所说的对于这位可怜的女孩子很重要。因为要赢得这些轻佻的年轻女孩子应有的尊重，她已经经历了很多困难了，要是她们再发现她能力不足，困难会再增加，她可能会觉得太痛苦而不愿在我们学校任职了——出现这种情况的话，我会为她感到十分遗憾，因为她几乎承受不起失去这里的工作。","‘Pardon me, monsieur, if I venture to add that what I have just said is of importance to the poor girl.She already experiences great difficulty in impressing these giddy young things with a due degree of deference for her authority, and should that difficulty he increased by new discoveries of her incapacity, she might find her position in my establishment too painful to be retained—a circumstance I should much regret for her sake, as she can ill afford to lose the profits of her occupation here.’"
"勒泰小姐拥有过人的机智。但是再机智灵敏，没有真诚来帮衬，有时也达不到效果。因此，这一次，她越是长篇大论地讲宽厚对待这位教师学生的必要性，就越让我听得心烦。我分辨得很清楚。她对外声称自己的动机是想帮这位迟钝但是善良的亨利小姐，而真正的动机只不过是要给我留下一个崇高善良、温柔体贴的好印象，为了避免再次听到她喋喋不休，我又一次匆忙点头同意她的话，还突然间尖声要求同学们交上作文，然后我走下讲台，开始收作文。","Mdlle. Reuter possessed marvellous tact; but tact the most exquisite, unsupported by sincerity, will sometimes fail of its effect.Thus, on this occasion, the longer she preached about the necessity of being indulgent to the governess-pupil, the more impatient I felt as I listened.I discerned so clearly that while her professed motive was a wish to aid the dull though well-meaning Mdlle. Henri, her real one was no other than a design to impress me with an idea of her own exalted goodness and tender considerateness; so having again hastily nodded assent to her remarks, I obviated their renewal by suddenly demanding the compositions, in a sharp accent, and stepping from the estrade I proceeded to collect them."
"我经过那位教师学生时，对她说：","As I passed the governess-pupil, I said to her,—"
"“你今天上课来得太晚了。下次尽量准时来上课。”","‘You have come in too late to receive a lesson today; try to be more punctual next time.’"
"我在她后面，没能从她的脸上看出我那句不太客气的言语产生的效果。大概即使我在她面前也不会费工夫去观察她吧。然而我注意到她立刻把书又收回到提包里，我回到讲台上整理一大堆作文时，不久就听到折叠门又一次打开然后关上了，我抬眼看过去，只见她的位置已经空了。我心里想着：“她会觉得第一次尝试听用英文讲的课是一种失败。”我想知道她是不是赌气离开的，又或许她的愚昧让她把我的话太当真了，再者，我生气的口气有没有伤了她的心呢？这最后一种念头，我几乎一想到就把它排除了，因为自从我到了比利时，还没有从人们的脸上看到过这种敏感的表情。我几乎已经把敏感看作一种美好的品质了。她的脸上有没有显露出这种表情，我没法说，因为她离开得很迅速，我没有时间确定当时的情况。其实，以前有那么两三次，我匆匆看到过她（我相信我之前提到过），但是我从未停下脚步仔细观察她的脸或是人，对她的外貌我只是有一个很模糊的印象。我刚刚卷好作文，四点的钟声就响了。带着习惯性的警觉，我听从了钟声的指示，抓起帽子，离开了教室。","I was behind her, and could not read in her face the effect of my not very civil speech.Probably I should not have troubled myself to do so had I been full in front; but I observed that she immediately began to slip her books into her cabas again; and presently, after I had returned to the estrade, while I was arranging the mass of compositions, I heard the folding-door again open and close, and on looking up I perceived her place vacant.I thought to myself, “She will consider her first attempt at taking a lesson in English something of a failure”; and I wondered whether she had departed in the sulks, or whether stupidity had induced her to take my words too literally, or, finally, whether my irritable tone had wounded her feelings.The last notion I dismissed almost as soon as I had conceived it; for not having seen any appearance of sensitiveness in any human face since my arrival in Belgium, I had begun to regard it almost as a fabulous quality.Whether her physiognomy announced it I could not tell, for her speedy exit had allowed me no time to ascertain the circumstance.I had, indeed, on two or three previous occasions, caught a passing view of her (as I believe has been mentioned before), but I had never stopped to scrutinize either her face or person, and had but the most vague idea of her general appearance.Just as I had finished rolling up the compositions, the four o’clock bell rang.With my accustomed alertness in obeying that signal, I grasped my hat and evacuated the premises."
"第十四章","CHAPTER XIV"
"如果说我离开勒泰小姐的学校准时，我到达那里至少也同样准时。第二天下午，差五分钟两点时，我来到教室门口，开门之前一阵急促而含混的声音提醒了我，“祈祷午餐”还没有结束。因此，我在门口等它结束；祈祷进行中时，我一个异教徒的出现是对上帝的亵渎。这些人是如何叽叽呱呱、喋喋不休地重复着祷告文啊！我以前没听到过，之后也没再听过人这般像蒸汽机一样急促地说话声了。“上天的圣父”像子弹一样飞快，接下来是对玛丽说的话，“天上的圣母，天使的母后，黄金之殿，象牙之塔”； 再接着是向当代的圣人祈祷，然后她们都坐下了，这个庄严的仪式结束了。我进来的时候，把门开得很大，阔步匆匆走进教室，这样走进来已是我的习惯，因为我发现了一个奥秘：镇静沉着地走进教室，迈着有力的步伐踏上讲台可以确保教室即刻安静下来。两个教室之间为祷告而打开的折叠门也即刻关上了。一个女教师，手拿针线盒，坐到了自己的位子上。学生们安静地坐着，钢笔和书本摆在面前；三个美女起到了带头作用，由于我一贯对她们态度冷漠，此刻她们正挺直了腰板，谦逊地坐在位子上，双手合十放在膝盖上。她们放弃了咯咯的笑，停止了互相窃窃私语，也不敢在我面前讲那些粗鲁的话。她们只是偶尔用眼睛和我交流。然而即便用眼睛这个器官，她们也能传达很大胆、很轻佻的讯息。要是她们明亮的双眼传达的是温情、善良、谦逊和才干，我想我不至于抑制自己，会时不时投以和蔼、鼓励，或者热情的目光作为回应；然而现状不是这样，我发现用坚韧自制的注视回应她们虚荣的眼光十分有趣。虽然我很多学生都朝气蓬勃、漂亮动人、光芒四射，但我可以很确定地说，她们在我身上从未看到过除严峻以外的其他姿态，尽管这种严峻的态度可能只会在监护人身上发现。如果有人怀疑我的言论的准确性，不愿意相信我，推断我这种行为只不过是更加自觉地克己行为或是西皮奥式的自控行为，我会让他们考虑以下情形，这些情况不但不会贬低我的优点，还会证明我说的是实话。","If I was punctual in quitting Mdlle. Reuter’s domicile, I was at least equally punctual in arriving there.I came the next day at five minutes before two, and on reaching the schoolroom door, before I opened it I heard a rapid, gabbling sound, which warned me that the prière du midi was not yet concluded.I waited the termination thereof; it would have been impious to intrude my heretical presence during its progress.How the repeater of the prayer did cackle and splutter!I never before or since heard language enounced with such steam-engine haste.‘Notre Père qui êtes au ciel’ went off like a shot; then followed an address to Marie ‘vièrge céleste, reine des anges, maison d’or, tour d'ivoire;’ and then an invocation to the saint of the day; and then down they all sat, and the solemn rite was overand I entered, flinging the door wide and striding in fast, as it was my wont to do now, for I had found that in entering with aplomb, and mounting the estrade with emphasis, consisted the grand secret of ensuring immediate silence.The folding-doors between the two classes, opened for the prayer, were instantly closed.A maîtresse, work-box in hand, took her seat at her appropriate desk.The pupils sat still with their pens and books before them, my three beauties in the van, now well humbled by a demeanour of consistent coolness, sat erect with their hands folded quietly on their knees.They had given up giggling and whispering to each other, and no longer ventured to utter pert speeches in my presence.They now only talked to me occasionally with their eyes, by means of which organs they could still, however, say very audacious and coquettish things.Had affection, goodness, modesty, real talent ever employed those bright orbs as interpreters, I do not think I could have refrained from giving a kind and encouraging, perhaps an ardent, reply now and then; but as it was, I found pleasure in answering the glance of vanity with the gaze of stoicism.Youthful, fair, brilliant as were many of my pupils, I can truly say that in me they never saw any other bearing than such as an austere though just guardian might have observed towards them.If any doubt the accuracy of this assertion, as inferring more conscientious self-denial or Scipiolike self-control than they feel disposed to give me credit for, let them take into consideration the following circumstances, which, while detracting from my merit, justify my veracity."
"噢，疑心的读者们！你知道，一个老师和一个漂亮单纯，很可能也无知的女学生间的关系有些不一样，这种关系不同于在舞会上抱着女伴跳舞，也不同于散步时对女士献殷勤。老师遇见学生，不是为看她身穿锦缎轻纱，不是为看她撒了香水的、卷卷的头发，不是为看她在梦幻般的蕾丝颈带下近乎显露无遗的脖子，也不是为看她雪白圆润、戴着手镯的胳膊，更不是为看她为翩翩起舞而精心装扮的双脚。教师不会带她伴着华尔兹舞曲旋转，对她大肆恭维，夸大她的美以满足她泛滥的虚荣心。教师也不会和学生在光滑平坦的林阴大道上，或是在绿意盎然、阳光灿烂的公园里私会，无论到哪里她都要穿上好看的外出服，将围巾优雅地搭在肩上，还要戴上几乎遮不住发卷的小帽，帽沿下插一朵红玫瑰，给她原本柔和粉嫩的脸颊增添了新的色彩；她的脸庞、眼睛也在微笑中显得神采焕发；或许这神采像节日里的阳光一样稍纵即逝，却依然灿烂夺目。教师更没有职责和学生并肩散步，听她活泼地讲话，为她撑一把不比一片绿色阔叶大多少的阳伞，用缎带牵一只布伦海姆狗或是意大利猎犬。不。他只在教室里看到她，穿着朴素，面前摆着一些书。由于个人修养或天性，她很讨厌书本，常带着厌恶之情翻开书；然而她的老师必须向她灌输这些书本的内容。她的头脑排斥那些严肃刻板的知识；它退缩，它开始难以驾驭。她的坏脾气显露出来，皱起的眉头毁坏了脸部的匀称美，偶尔摆出的粗鲁姿势让她的举止不再优雅；而她嘟哝的抱怨话语，让人联想起根深蒂固的本地粗话，亵渎了她甜美的嗓音。当她的脾气变得温和，但理解力还是迟钝时，她那无法战胜的麻木感会让她反对任何教导。只要有诡计——而不是活力——时，掩饰、谎言等无数的伎俩都会上演，以逃避用功读书。总之，对于教师来说，女学生的青春活力和女学生的魅力就像挂毯，反面总对着教师，即便看到那平滑、齐整的外表，也很难被诱使着由衷地赞赏大众都能看见的美丽图案和鲜艳色彩，因为他对挂毯背面有多么难看的疙瘩，多么长的针脚，多么参差不齐的线头，再清楚不过了。","Know, O incredulous reader!that a master stands in a somewhat different relation towards a pretty, lightheaded, probably ignorant girl to that occupied by a partner at a ball or a gallant on the promenade.A professor does not meet his pupil to see her dressed in satin and muslin, with hair perfumed and curled, neck scarcely shaded by aerial lace, round white arms circled with bracelets, feet dressed for the gliding dance.It is not his business to whirl her through the waltz, to feed her with compliments, to heighten her beauty by the flush of gratified vanity.Neither does he encounter her on the smooth-rolled, tree-shaded boulevard, in the green and sunny park, whither she repairs clad in her becoming walking-dress, her scarf thrown with grace over her shoulders, her little bonnet scarcely screening her curls, the red rose under its brim adding a new tint to the softer rose on her cheek, her face and eyes, too, illumined with smiles, perhaps as transient as the sunshine of the gala-day, but also quite as brilliant.It is not his office to walk by her side, to listen to her lively chat, to carry her parasol, scarcely larger than a broad green leaf, to lead in a ribbon her Blenheim spaniel or Italian greyhound.No. He finds her in the schoolroom, plainly dressed, with books before her.Owing to her education or her nature, books are to her a nuisance, and she opens them with aversion; yet her teacher must instil into her mind the contents of these books.That mind resists the admission of grave information; it recoils, it grows restive.Sullen tempers are shown, disfiguring frowns spoil the symmetry of the face, sometimes coarse gestures banish grace from the deportment, while muttered expressions, redolent of native and ineradicable vulgarity, desecrate the sweetness of the voice.Where the temperament is serene though the intellect be sluggish, an unconquerable dullness opposes every effort to instruct.Where there is cunning but not energy, dissimulation, falsehood, a thousand schemes and tricks are put in play to evade the necessity of application.In short, to the tutor, female youth, female charms, are like tapestry hangings of which the wrong side is continually turned towards him; and even when he sees the smooth, neat external surface, he so well knows what knots, long stitches, and jagged ends are behind that he has scarce a temptation to admire too fondly the seemly forms and bright colours exposed to general view."
"我们的喜好会随着所处环境而改变。画家偏爱多山的村庄，因为那里风景如画；工程师偏爱平坦的村庄，因为那里施工便利；花花公子偏爱他所谓的“美丽女人”，因为她适合他；年轻时髦的绅士追求同样年轻时髦的淑女，因为他们门当户对；辛苦工作而筋疲力尽，很可能脾气也暴躁的教师，对美几乎视而不见，对装腔作势和风度翩翩也无动于衷。而某些良好的心理品质：专心致志、热爱知识、聪明、温柔、真诚、懂得感恩，大多会吸引他的注意力，赢得他的尊重。他在寻找这些品质，却很难找到；假如偶然发现了，他也会乐于将其永远记在心中，当分别将其剥夺时，他会感觉像是有一只残忍的手从他那里抢走了他唯一的羔羊。情况确实如此，既然如此，那么我说我在勒泰小姐的寄宿女校的言行正直而恰当，既没什么值得称道也没什么让人惊讶的，读者们也会赞同我的。","Our likings are regulated by our circumstances.The artist prefers a hilly country because it is picturesque; the engineer a flat one because it is convenient; the man of pleasure likes what he calls ‘a fine woman’—she suits him; the fashionable young gentleman admires the fashionable young lady—she is of his kind; the toil-worn, fagged, probably irritable tutor, blind almost to beauty, insensible to airs and graces, glories chiefly in certain mental qualities: application, love of knowledge, natural capacity, docility, truthfulness, gratefulness are the charms that attract his notice and win his regard.These he seeks, but seldom meets; these if by chance he finds, he would fain retain for ever; and when separation deprives him of them he feels as if some ruthless hand had snatched from him his only ewe-Iamb.Such being the case, and the case it is, my readers will agree with me that there was nothing either very meritorious or very marvellous in the integrity and moderation of my conduct at Mdlle. Reuter’ s pensionnat de demoiselles."
"我今天下午的第一项任务就是宣读这个月学生的名次，他们的名次由前一天收上来的作文的正确度决定；名单之首照例是西尔维——一个平凡、安静的小女孩。我曾这样描述过她，她是这学校里最棒，也是最丑的学生了；得第二的是一个叫莱奥妮·勒德吕的姑娘，她身材矮小，五官清楚，肤色如羊皮纸一般，她机智灵敏，没什么道德观念，心肠硬，是个律师般的人物，我曾经说过她要是个男生，定会成为一个典型的没有原则而又聪明伶俐的律师。接着是厄拉利，那位骄傲的美女，学校的朱诺女神。尽管智力迟钝，但苦练简单英语语法六年，迫使她机械地熟悉了大多数语法规则。当听到第一个读到的名字是自己时，西尔维修女般冷漠的脸上没有微笑，没有一丝愉悦或满足的痕迹。看到这位可怜的姑娘在任何场合都是如此沉静，我总觉得悲哀。我习惯尽量不看她，不跟她讲话。假若我没有发现她会将我每句友好的话语，每个亲切的举动报告给听她忏悔的神父，神父还误解、诬蔑我的言行，她的极度温驯、勤奋和坚持会大大博得我的好感，她的谦逊和智慧也会让我更温和、亲切地对待她，尽管她相貌近乎丑陋，身材不匀称，面容也如死尸般缺乏生气。一次，为了表示赞扬，我把手放在了她头上。我原以为西尔维会微笑——她黯淡无神的眼睛几乎变得闪闪发亮；然而不一会儿，她就避开了我。我是个男人，还是个异教徒；她呢，可怜的孩子！她注定是个修女，是个虔诚的天主教徒。因此，一堵四重的墙把我们两人的心灵就此分开。粗鲁的假笑，自鸣得意而刻薄的一瞥是莱奥妮显示满足感的方式。厄拉利有些嫉妒，闷闷不乐。她本期望自己能拿第一。听到自己的名字几乎排在了名单的最后，奥尔唐斯和卡罗琳向彼此扮出一个满不在乎的鬼脸。她们并不把智力低人一等认为是丢脸的事，她们对未来的憧憬只建立在自己迷人的外貌上。","My first business this afternoon consisted in reading the list of places for the month, determined by the relative correctness of the compositions given the preceding day. The list was headed, as usual, by the name of Sylvie—that plain, quiet little girl I have described before as being at once the best and ugliest pupil in the establishment; the second place had fallen to the lot of a certain Léonie Ledru, a diminutive, sharp-featured, and parchment-skinned creature of quick wits, frail conscience, and indurated feelings—a lawyer-like thing, of whom I used to say that, had she been a boy, she would have made a model of an unprincipled, clever attorney.Then came Eulalie, the proud beauty, the Juno of the school, whom six long years of drilling in the simple grammar of the English language had compelled, despite the stiff phlegm of her intellect, to acquire a mechanical acquaintance with most of its rules.No smile, no trace of pleasure or satisfaction appeared in Sylvie’s nun-like and passive face as she heard her name read first.I always felt saddened by the sight of that poor girl’s absolute quiescence on all occasions, and it was my custom to look at her, to address her, as seldom as possible.Her extreme docility, her assiduous perseverance, would have recommended her warmly to my good opinion; her modesty, her intelligence, would have induced me to feel most kindly, most affectionately towards her, notwithstanding the almost ghastly plainness of her features, the disproportion of her form, the corpse-like lack of animation in her countenance, had I not been aware that every friendly word, every kindly action, would be reported by her to her confessor, and by him misinterpreted and poisoned.Once I laid my hand on her head in token of approbation.I thought Sylvie was going to smile—her dim eye almost kindled; but presently she shrank from me.I was a man and a heretic; she, poor child! a destined nun and devoted Catholic.Thus a fourfold wall of separation divided her mind from mine.A pert smirk and a hard glance of triumph was Léonie’s method of testifying her gratification.Eulalie looked sullen and envious.She had hoped to be first.Hortense and Caroline exchanged a reckless grimace on hearing their names read out somewhere near the bottom of the list; the brand of mental inferiority was considered by them as no disgrace, their hopes for the future being based solely on their personal attractions."
"这件事情处理完，接下来正式上课。利用学生们整理书的短暂间隙，我的眼睛漫不经心地搜寻一排排的座椅，第一次观察到，最后一排最远的那个位置——平常总空着的座位——又被我的新学生坐了。她也就是女校长铺陈了很多，极力推荐给我的亨利小姐。今天我戴了眼镜，因而一眼就看清了她的外貌；我不必再苦苦想她到底长什么样了。她看上去挺年轻，然而要我给出她的确切年龄，我会觉得有些为难。从她纤细的身形推断，她可能就十七岁；然而她忧虑、心事重重的表情像在表明她已达到了更成熟的年龄。她的穿着和其他人并无二致，一件黑色长外衣配白色的领子。她的相貌和其他人都不同——脸没有那么圆，五官比较分明，但说不上匀称。她的头型也不同于其他人——上部长得更大些，底部相当小。第一眼看到她时，我就确定她不是比利时人。她的肤色、相貌、轮廓和身形都和其他人都不一样，很显然她是另一个种族的人——一个身体没那么丰满，脸色没那么红润的种族，一个相比之下少了些幸福感、少了些物质欲望并多了些思考的种族。最初我把目光投向她时，她手掌托着下巴，一动不动地向下看；直到我开始讲课，她都没有变换姿势。没有一个比利时姑娘可以这么长时间保持同一种姿势，况且是思考的姿势。然而，我已经透露过，她的相貌有些奇特，不同于她的佛兰芒同伴们，那么关于相貌我没有其他要说的了。我不能称赞她的美貌，因为她并不漂亮。我也不能对她的平平相貌表示怜悯，因为这相貌还过得去。她的额头显得忧心忡忡，嘴型也是如此，这触动了我的心，心里有种像是惊异的感觉；然而这些特质，对于一个没那么敏感的人很可能不会注意到。","This affair arranged, the regular lesson followed.During a brief interval, employed by the pupils in ruling their books my eye, ranging carelessly over the benches, observed, for the first time, that the farthest seat in the farthest row—a seat usually vacant—was again filled by the new scholar, the Mdlle. Henri so ostentatiously recommended to me by the directness.Today I had on my spectacles; her appearance, therefore, was clear to me at the first glance; I had not to puzzle over it. She looked young, yet had I been required to name her exact age I should have been somewhat nonplussed.The slightness of her figure might have suited seventeen; a certain anxious and preoccupied expression of face seemed the indication of riper years.She was dressed, like all the rest, in a dark stuff gown and a white collar.Her features were dissimilar to any there—not so rounded, more defined, yet scarcely regular.The shape of her head too was different—the superior part more developed, the base considerably less.I felt assured, at first sight, that she was not a Belgian.Her complexion, her countenance, her lineaments, her figure were all distinct from theirs, and evidently the type of another race—of a race less gifted with fullness of flesh and plenitude of blood, less jocund, material, unthinking.When I first cast my eyes on her, she sat looking fixedly down, her chin resting on her hand, and she did not change her attitude till I commenced the lesson.None of the Belgian girls would have retained one position, and that a reflective one, for the same length of time.Yet, having intimated that her appearance was peculiar, as being unlike that of her Flemish companions, I have little more to say respecting it. I can pronounce no encomiums on her beauty, for she was not beautiful, nor offer condolence on her plainness, for neither was she plain.A careworn character of forehead and a corresponding moulding of the mouth struck me with a sentiment resembling surprise, but these traits would probably have passed unnoticed by any less crotchety observer."
"读者们，关于亨利小姐我已描述了一页多。但我深知在你们的脑海中她并没有留下的清晰图像；我没有描述她的肤色、眼睛，或者头发，就连她的外形轮廓也没加以叙述。你无从知道她的鼻子是鹰钩鼻还是朝天鼻，她的下巴是长还是短，她的脸形是方还是椭圆；第一天看她，我也无法了解这些，况且我也无意把自己一点一点了解到的信息一次全传达给你们。","Now, reader, though I have spent more than a page in describing Mdlle. Henri, I know well enough that I have left on your mind’s eye no distinct picture of her; I have not painted her complexion, nor her eyes, nor her hair, nor even drawn the outline of her shape.You cannot tell whether her nose was aquiline or retroussé, whether her chin was long or short, her face square or oval; nor could I the first day, and it is not my intention to communicate to you at once a knowledge I myself gained by little and little."
"我让她们做了个简短的练习，都要写下来。起初我看到这位新生面露困惑，因为这种形式和语言十分新奇。有那么一两回，她显得很伤脑筋，很焦虑地抬头看我，像是她根本无法理解我的意思。她没有像其他人一样准备就绪。她也无法写得像她们一样迅速。我不想帮她，便没有间断地继续读了下去。她看着我，眼神很显然传递着“我无法跟上你”的讯息。我无视她的恳求，漠然地仰靠在椅子上，并且时不时漫不经心地向窗外看去，读得更快了一些。再次看她时，我觉察到她的脸上满是窘迫之情，然而她仍然孜孜不倦地努力写着。我停了一小会儿。她赶忙利用这会儿时间重新审查自己写出来的东西，脸上明显露出羞愧和挫败的表情；显然，她觉得自己做得非常糟糕。又过了十分钟，听写结束，我给她们留出一点时间修改之后，便把她练习本都收了上来。亨利小姐很不情愿地把本子交了出来。然而一把本子交给我，她那张忧虑的脸就平静了下来，好像现在她已经决定消除心中的懊悔，也打定主意就让别人认为她绝顶愚蠢吧。","I gave a short exercise which they all wrote down.I saw the new pupil was puzzled at first with the novelty of the form and language.Once or twice she looked at me with a sort of painful solicitude, as not comprehending at all what I meant.Then she was not ready when the others were; she could not write her phrases so fast as they did.I would not help her; I went on relentless.She looked at me; her eye said most plainly, ‘I cannot follow you.’I disregarded the appeal, and, carelessly leaning back in my chair, glancing from time to time with a nonchalant air out of the window, I dictated a little faster.On looking towards her again, I perceived her face clouded with embarrassment, but she was still writing on most diligently.I paused a few seconds.She employed the interval in hurriedly reperusing what she had written, and shame and discomfiture were apparent in her countenance; she evidently found she had made great nonsense of it.In ten minutes more the dictation was complete, and, having allowed a brief space in which to correct it, I took their books.It was with a reluctant hand that Mdlle. Henri gave up hers; but, having once yielded it to my possession, she composed her anxious face, as if, for the present, she had resolved to dismiss regret, and had made up her mind to be thought unprecedentedly stupid."
"我浏览了一下她的作业，发现有几行落下没写，但是写出来的很少出错。我马上在页面下方写了个“好”字，把练习本归还给她。她微笑，刚开始是有些不相信，接着好像是放心了，但没有抬起眼来。似乎她只在感到茫然不知所措时才看我，感到满足时却不会。我认为这不怎么公平。","Glancing over her exercise, I found that several lines had been omitted, but what was written contained very few faults.I instantly inscribed ‘Bon’ at the bottom of the page, and returned it to her.She smiled, at first incredulously, then as if reassured, but did not lift her eyes.She could look at me, it seemed, when perplexed and bewildered, but not when gratified.I thought that scarcely fair."
"第十五章","CHAPTER XV"
"再次给一班上课时，已过了好几天。圣灵降临节的假期占去了三天，第四天又轮到给二班上课。经过苗圃时，像往常一样，我看到一群学习针线活的女孩子围着亨利小姐。她们只有十几个人，但声音却可能足有五十人那样大；她们似乎不大听从亨利小姐的管束。三四个人一起胡搅蛮缠地要求着什么；她看上去有些厌烦，要大家安静，但却白搭。她看到了我，我从她眼神里看出了苦恼，那种被陌生人撞见自己管不住学生的苦恼。她好像在恳求大家遵守规矩。可她的祈求却无济于事。接着我看到她闭紧了嘴唇，眉头皱起，她的面容，如果我理解正确的话，像是在说：“我已经尽力而为了。尽管如此，我受责备看来也是应该的。谁愿意责备我就来吧。”我继续向前走。正当我关上教室门时，听到她突然尖声对其中一个年龄最长也是最吵闹的学生说：","Some time elapsed before I again gave a lesson in the first class.The holiday of Whitsuntide occupied three days, and on the fourth it was the turn of the second division to receive my instructions.As I made the transit of the carré, I observed, as usual, the band of sewers surrounding Mdlle. Henri.There were only about a dozen of them, but they made as much noise as might have sufficed for fifty; they seemed very little under her control.Three or four at once assailed her with importunate requirements; she looked harassed, she demanded silence, but in vain.She saw me, and I read in her eye pain that a stranger should witness the insubordination of her pupils.She seemed to entreat order.Her prayers were useless.Then I remarked that she compressed her lips and contracted her brow, and her countenance, if I read it correctly, said, ‘I have done my best.I seem to merit blame notwithstanding.blame me, then, who will.’I passed on.As I closed the schoolroom door I heard her say, suddenly and sharply, addressing one of the eldest and most turbulent of the lot—"
"“阿梅莉·米朗贝，接下来的一周内别问我任何问题，别要我帮助你；这一周，我既不会跟你讲话也不会帮你。”","‘Amelie Mullenberg, ask me no question, and request of me no assistance, for a week to come; during that space of time I will neither speak to you nor help you.’"
"说这话的时候加重了语气——不仅如此，言辞也很激烈，接下来，姑娘们相对安静了。这安静能否持久，我不清楚；现在在我和苗圃之间的两扇门都关上了。","The words were uttered with emphasis—nay, with vehemence and a comparative silence followed.Whether the calm was permanent, I know not; two doors now closed between me and the carré."
"隔天是要给一班上课的。我一到教室，便看到女校长照旧坐在两个讲台之间的一张椅子上，面前站着亨利小姐。她的姿态在我看来，似乎有些不大情愿专心听。","Next day was appropriated to the first class.On my arrival I found the directress seated, as usual, in a chair between the two estrades, and before her was standing Mdlle. Henri, in an attitude (as it seemed to me) of somewhat reluctant attention."
"女校长边织东西边说话。在嘈杂的大教室里，对一个人耳语并且只让她一人听到是很简单的事。勒泰小姐和她手下的老师就这样讨论着什么。这老师的脸有些泛红，不是因为有些焦虑，而是出于烦恼；这烦恼根源何处，我不知道，因为实际上女校长看起来非常心平气和。她不可能用这么柔和的耳语，这么平静的态度来训斥她。当然不会了。不一会儿，我就证实了她的谈话是非常友好的，因为我听到了最后几句：","The directness was knitting and talking at the same time.Amidst the hum of a large schoolroom it was easy so to speak in the ear of one person as to be heard by that person alone, and it was thus Mdlle. Reuter parleyed with her teacher.The face of the latter was a little flushed, not a little troubled; there was vexation in it—whence resulting I know not, for the directress looked very placid indeed.She could not be scolding in such gentle whispers and with so equable a mien.No; it was presently proved that her discourse had been of the most friendly tendency, for I heard the closing words, —"
"“我的好朋友，就说这么多吧。此刻，我不想再耽误你的时间了。”","‘C’est assez, ma bonne amie; a present je ne veux pas vous retenir davantage.’"
"亨利小姐没有回答，就转身走开了。","Without reply, Mdlle. Henri turned away."
"她脸上的表情明显地显示着自己的不满；她在教室的位子上坐下时，嘴唇一撇，露出一丝微笑，轻微而短暂，但包含着苦涩和质疑，我觉得还带着一丝鄙夷。她无意的微笑仅仅持续了一秒，这是个秘密，接着是沮丧的神情，但不一会儿，当我告诉大家拿出阅读课本时，她的沮丧就被专注和兴趣盎然的表情驱散了。通常我很厌恶上阅读课，听她们用粗俗的发音读着我的母语，简直是对耳朵的折磨；我费力地言传身教似乎对纠正她们的口音起不了一点点作用。今天同往常一样，每人操着自己的调子，含混不清、结结巴巴、叽里咕哝、吱吱喳喳地读了下来。大约十五人轮番折磨过我之后，我的听觉神经在无可奈何地等着第十六个噪音，此时一个低沉但却饱满的声音读出声来，读着清楚、准确的英语：","Dissatisfaction was plainly evinced in her face, and a smile, slight and brief, but bitter, distrustful, and, I thought, scornful, curled her lip as she took her place in the class.It was a secret, involuntary smile, which lasted but a second; an air of depression succeeded, chased away presently by one of attention and interest, when I gave the word for all the pupils to take their reading-books.In general I hated the reading-lesson it was such a torture to the ear to listen to their uncouth mouthing of my native tongue, and no effort of example or precept on my part ever seemed to effect the slightest improvement in their accent.Today each, in her appropriate key, lisped, stuttered, mumbled, and jabbered as usual.About fifteen had racked me in turn, and my auricular nerve was expecting with resignation the discords of the sixteenth, when a full though low voice read out, in clear, correct English, —"
"“在去珀斯的路上，国王遇见一位高地妇人，她称自己是先知。她站在国王北去要经过的渡口边上高声叫道：‘国王陛下，如果你过了这条河，你将永远不会活着回来。’”（见《苏格兰历史》）","‘On his way to Perth the king was met by a Highland woman calling herself a prophetess.She stood at the side of the ferry by which he was about to travel to the north, and cried with a loud voice, “My lord the king, if you pass this water you will never return again alive.”’ (Vide the ‘History of Scotland.’)"
"我诧异地抬头看去。这声音是英国口音，听上去纯正、悦耳，只是缺了与埃塞克斯或者米德尔塞克斯那些受过良好教育的女士的发音相类似的坚定和自信。然而说话的人或者说读书的人不是别人，正是亨利小姐。我见她一脸庄重、阴郁，没有丝毫迹象表明她意识到自己的壮举。也没有一个人对此表示惊讶。勒泰小姐还在认认真真地织着东西。然而我发觉，亨利小姐读完这一段话时，她眼皮抬起来，斜视了我一眼。她不了解这位女教师读得多么出色，不过她觉察到她的口音不像其他人，于是她想了解我的想法。我用漠然掩饰着表情，命令下一位女孩子继续读。","I looked up in amazement.The voice was a voice of Albion; the accent was pure and silvery; it only wanted firmness and assurance to be the counterpart of what any well-educated lady in Essex or Middlesex might have enounced; yet the speaker or reader was no other than Mdlle. Henri, in whose grave, joyless face I saw no mark of consciousness that she had performed any extraordinary feat.No one else evinced surprise either.Mdlle. Reuter knitted away assiduously.I was aware, however, that at the conclusion of the paragraph she had lifted her eyelid and honoured me with a glance sideways.She did not know the full excellency of the teacher’s style of reading, but she perceived that her accent was not that of the others, and wanted to discover what I thought.I masked my visage with indifference, and ordered the next girl to proceed."
"课上完了，我趁人群散去时混乱之际走近亨利小姐。她站在窗前，看见我走上前去，就退了回来。她以为我要向外看，没有想到我会有话跟她说。我把练习本从她手里拿过来。我一边翻看，一边同她讲话。","When the lesson was over, I took advantage of the confusion caused by breaking up to approach Mdlle. Henri.She was standing near the window, and retired as I advanced.She thought I wanted to look out, and did not imagine that I could have anything to say to her.I took her exercise-book out of her hand.As I turned over the leaves I addressed her."
"“你以前上过英语课吗？”我问。","‘You have had lessons in English before?’ I asked."
"“没有，先生。”","‘No, sir.’"
"“没有？你读得很不错。你曾经去过英格兰吗？”","‘No!You read very well.You have been in England?’"
"“噢，没有！”她情绪有些高涨地回答。","‘Oh no!’ with some animation."
"“那你曾经住在英国人家庭里吗？”","‘You have been in English families?’"
"答案依旧是“没有”。这会儿我的目光停留在本子的衬页上，看到上面写着‘弗朗西斯·埃文斯·亨利’。","Still the answer was ‘No.’ Here my eye, resting on the flyleaf of the book, saw written, ‘Frances Evans Henri.’"
"“这是你的名字吗？”我问。","‘Your name?’ I asked."
"“是的，先生。”","‘Yes, sir.’"
"我的询问被打断了。我听到背后一阵轻微的沙沙声——背后的正是女校长——她宣称要检查一张课桌的里面。","My interrogations were cut short.I heard a little rustling behind me, and close at my back was the directress, professing to be examining the interior of a desk."
"“小姐”，她抬起头来对这位女教师说道，“当那些年轻的姑娘们放东西时，你可否好心站到走廊里，设法维持一下秩序？”","‘Mademoiselle,’ said she, looking up and addressing the teacher, ‘will you have the goodness to go and stand in the corridor, while the young ladies are putting on their things, and try to keep some order?’"
"亨利小姐听从了她的命令。","Mdlle. Henri obeyed."
"“天气真棒！”女校长一边快活地说着，一边向窗外看去。我表示赞同，并打算离去。“先生，您的新学生怎么样？”她继续说道，跟着我离去的脚步。“她的英语有希望进步吗？”","‘What splendid weather!’ observed the directress cheerfully, glancing at the same time from the window.I assented, and was withdrawing.‘What of your new pupil, monsieur?’ continued she, following my retreating steps.‘Is she likely to make progress in English?’"
"“这确实很难判断。她拥有漂亮的口音。说到她真正的英语知识水平，我还没有机会去了解，也没什么观点。”","‘Indeed I can hardly judge.She possesses pretty good accent.Of her real knowledge of the language I have as yet had no opportunity of forming an opinion.’"
"“那么先生，她的天分如何？我对这个有点担心。您能否确信她的能力至少在一般水平上，好让我放心？”","‘And her natural capacity, monsieur?I have had my fears about that.Can you relieve me by an assurance at least of its average power?’"
"“小姐，我没有任何理由怀疑她天分一般，但事实上，我确实不怎么了解她，也还没有时间研究她的能力如何。我祝您下午好！”","‘I see no reason to doubt its average power, mademoiselle, but really I scarcely know her, and have not had time to study the calibre of her capacity.I wish you a very good afternoon.’"
"她仍旧追着我不放。“您会注意到的，先生，而且您要告诉我您的想法；相比我自己的看法，我更加相信您的看法。女人无法像男人一样对这些事情作出合理判断；先生，请原谅我的固执，然而我对这个可怜的小姑娘有兴趣是很自然的。她没什么亲戚，只能全靠自己的努力。她的学识是她唯一的财富。她现在的职务我曾经也做过，或者说我做过几乎一样的工作，那么我自然而然就对她产生了怜悯之情。有时看到她费那么大力气管理学生，我会觉得懊悔。我没有怀疑她已经尽了力，她的意图是好的，可是先生，她缺乏机智和坚定。我也就此跟她谈过，但我口齿不够伶俐，很可能没表达清楚。她好像一点也没理解我的意思。偶尔看到有合适的机会的话，您能就此向她提点建议吗？男人的影响力比女人大得多——男人论证问题比女人更有逻辑性，尤其是先生您，您有种强大的力量，能让您的学生们服从命令。您的建议只会给她带来好处。即便她会闷闷不乐、固执任性（我希望她不会这样），她也决不会拒绝听您的话。至于我自己，我可以很肯定地说，每一回听您的课，亲眼看见您如何管理学生，我无不觉得从中受益。我总为其他教师担心。他们没法赢得这些年轻女学生的尊重，也遏制不了年轻人本能的轻浮行为。在先生您身上，我感受到了绝对的信心。因而，就试着帮帮这个可怜的孩子吧，让她能管住这些举止轻浮、精力过剩的布拉班特女孩子吧。然而先生，我还要再说一句：不要触动她的自尊，当心别伤害了她的自尊。虽然不情愿，但我不得不承认这一点——有人会觉得可笑——她的敏感真该受责备。恐怕无意间我已经触到了她的痛处，而且她还没法恢复过来。”","She still pursued me.‘You will observe, monsieur, and tell me what you think; I could so much better rely on your opinion than on my own.Women cannot judge of these things as men can; and, excuse my pertinacity, monsieur, but it is natural I should feel interested about this poor little girl.She has scarcely any relations; her own efforts are all she has to look to; her acquirements must be her sole fortune.Her present position has once been mine, or nearly so; it is then but natural I should sympathize with her; and sometimes, when I see the difficulty she has in managing pupils, I feel quite chagrined.I doubt not she does her best; her intentions are excellent; but, monsieur, she wants tact and firmness.I have talked to her on the subject, but I am not fluent, and probably did not express myself with clearness; she never appears to comprehend me.Now, would you occasionally, when you see an opportunity, slip in a word of advice to her on the subject?Men have so much more influence than women have—they argue so much more logically than we do; and you, monsieur, in particular, have so paramount a power of making yourself obeyed.A word of advice from you could not but do her good.Even if she were sullen and headstrong (which I hope she is not) she would scarcely refuse to listen to you.For my own part, I can truly say that I never attend one of your lessons without deriving benefit from witnessing your management of the pupils.The other masters are a constant source of anxiety to me; they cannot impress the young ladies with sentiments of respect, nor restrain the levity natural to youth.In you, monsieur, I feel the most absolute confidence.Try, then, to put this poor child into the way of controlling our giddy, high-spirited Brabantoises.But, monsieur, I would add one word more: don’t alarm her amour propre, beware of inflicting a wound there.I reluctantly admit that in that particular she is blamably—some would say ridiculously—susceptible.I fear I have touched this sore point inadvertently, and she cannot get over it.’"
"在她发表这篇高谈阔论的大部分时间里，我的手都放在外门的锁上。这会儿我把门打开了。","During the greater part of this harangue my hand was on the lock of the outer door.I now turned it."
"“再见了，小姐。”我说着就逃了出去。我知道离女校长的阔论结束还早。她注视着我的背影；她倒很乐意挽留我。从我对她的态度开始变得强硬、冷漠之后，她对我的态度也变了。几乎每次她都要对我谄媚奉承，她不断揣测我的表情，对我表现出无微不至的关心。奴颜媚骨能酿造暴政。这种奴隶般的顺从，不会让我心软，只会让我的心更加严厉、苛刻。她现在这个样子，像只着了迷的小鸟般围着我打转，却似乎只能把我变成刚硬的石柱。她像连珠炮一样说个不停，只会激起我的鄙夷，她的奉承话让我更坚定了缄默的态度。有时我很想知道，既然对她更有好处的珀莱先生已经在她掌控之中，她为何要如此自寻烦恼来赢得我？况且，她也觉察到我知道她的秘密——因为我毫无顾忌地告诉了她；事实是这样的，她本性怀疑现实，轻视谦虚、温情和无私的价值——她把这些品格看成是性格上的缺陷——因而也是因为这样，她认为骄傲、冷酷和自私才能证明力量。她会践踏谦虚的颈项，却会屈膝于鄙视的脚下；她会暗带蔑视地幽会温柔，却百般殷切地追求冷漠。仁慈、忠实和热忱都是她反感的，虚伪和私心才是她的偏好——在她眼里，这些才是真正的智慧。她嗜好道德的沦丧与身体的退化，心智与身体的卑劣，这些像是金箔，正好能够派上用场，衬托她自己的禀赋。对于残暴、不义和专横，她听之任之：这些就是她天生的主宰者。她没有憎恶倾向，也没有抵制主宰者们的冲动；这些在别人心里唤醒义愤的东西在她的心里却没有。这一切所产生的后果是：虚假和自私称她为明智，鄙俗和低劣称她为宽厚，目中无人、不公不正称她为和蔼可亲；通常，而善良、仁慈起初认为她靠得住，因为她宣称自己也善良、仁慈；而不久，掩饰的镀层被磨掉，真正的材料从下面露出，善良、仁慈就会抛弃她这个骗子。","‘An revoir, mademoiselle,’ said I, and I escaped.I saw the directress’s stock of words was yet far from exhausted.She looked after me; she would fain have detained me longer.Her manner towards me had been altered ever since I had begun to treat her with hardness and indifference.She almost cringed to me on every occasion; she consulted my countenance incessantly, and beset me with innumerable little officious attentions.Servility creates despotism.This slavish homage, instead of softening my heart, only pampered whatever was stern and exacting in its mood.The very circumstance of her hovering round me like a fascinated bird seemed to transform me into a rigid pillar of stone; her Batteries irritated my scorn, her blandishments confirmed my reserve.At times I wondered what she meant by giving herself such trouble to win me, when the more profitable Pelet was already in her nets, and when, too, she was aware that I possessed her secret—for I had not scrupled to tell her as much; but the fact is that as it was her nature to doubt the reality and undervalue the worth of modesty, affection, disinterestedness—to regard these qualities as foibles of character—so it was equally her tendency to consider pride, hardness, selfishness, as proofs of strength.She would trample on the neck of humility, she would kneel at the feet of disdain; she would meet tenderness with secret contempt, indifference she would woo with ceaseless assiduities.Benevolence, devotedness, enthusiasm were her antipathies; for dissimulation and self-interest she had a preference—they were real wisdom in her eyes.Moral and physical degradation, mental and bodily inferiority she regarded with indulgence: they were foils capable of being turned to good account as set-offs for her own endowments.To violence, injustice, tyranny, she succumbed: they were her natural masters.She had no propensity to hate, no impulse to resist them; the indignation their behests awake in some hearts was unknown in hers.From all this it resulted that the false and selfish called her wise, the vulgar and debased termed her charitable, the insolent and unjust dubbed her amiable, the conscientious and benevolent generally at first accepted as valid her claim to be considered one of themselves; but ere long the plating of pretension wore off, the real material appeared below, and they laid her aside as a deception."
"第十六章","CHAPTER XVI"
"在后来的两星期里，我常常见到弗朗西斯·埃文斯·亨利，这让我对她的性格有了更确切的认识。我发觉她在一定程度上至少有两处显著优点——那就是坚韧和责任感。我还发觉她的确有专心学习和与困难斗争的能力。我总发现别人需要帮助，于是刚开始时我也曾给予她同样的帮助。起初我为她解决每个困难。可我很快就发现，在我的新生看来这种帮助有辱人格。她有些傲气，不耐烦地抗拒我的帮助。于是我给她布置了长期作业，让她独自解决任何可能出现的复杂问题。她以极大的激情开始去做这项任务，飞快地完成一项任务后，又迫切要求做更多的事。我就说这么多她的坚韧了。至于她的责任感，表现为这种方式：她喜欢学习，但却讨厌授课。作为学生，她的进步取决于她自己，我看到她自己做打算很有把握；作为一名教师，她的成功部分地，或许主要地依赖于别人的意志。与他人的意志发生冲突时，她付出了最艰辛的努力，奋力让别人的意志屈服于自己的意志；因为通常在受人尊重的人眼里，她的意志因为重重顾虑而受阻。凡是关乎自己的事情，她都会表现得义无反顾；假如那种意向与她的是非观背道而驰，她会在任何情况下支配自己的意向；然而，在需要与那些癖好、那些习惯和他人的错误，特别是与那些对道理充耳不闻的孩子们的错误作斗争的时，大多数情况下，尤其对于劝告已没有感觉的情况下，她的意志有时就几乎拒绝发挥作用；接着，责任感便油然而生，强迫这种不情愿的意志采取行动。其结果往往就是对精力和劳动的巨大浪费。弗朗西斯为了孩子们辛勤劳动，也陪着她们一起辛勤劳动，就像一名苦工。不过，在她那尽职尽责的努力换来诸如孩子们的顺从之前，却需要很长的时日，因为她们意识到自己可以支配她，因此她们可以通过反抗她为规劝、说服和控制她们所付出的艰辛尝试——迫使她采取种种强制性措施——而让她忍受剧烈的痛楚。人类——特别是人类的子女——很少会拒绝这种行使权力的乐趣，他们知道自己拥有这种权力，即使这一权力的意义仅仅在于它能够让别人不幸。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　一个学生的感受比老师的迟钝，勇气却比老师的强大，体力也或许比老师的充沛，他比起老师来有着巨大的优势；他通常会持续不断地使用这一优势，因为这个十分年轻、健康、做事欠考虑的人既不知道如何同情，又不知道如何饶恕。我担心弗朗西斯承受了太多，长期的重担似乎压制着她的精神。我曾经说过，她不住在学校，不管住在自己的住所还是别的什么地方，她是否也似在勒泰小姐的屋檐下这般带着同样专著、严肃、感伤而坚定的神情——这种神情总掩盖着她的相貌，这我可说不来了。","In the course of another fortnight I had seen sufficient of Frances Evans Henri to enable me to form a more definite opinion of her character.I found her possessed in a somewhat remarkable degree of at least two good points—namely, perseverance and a sense of duty.I found she was really capable of applying to study, of contending with difficulties.At first I offered her the same help which I had always found it necessary to confer on the others.I began with unloosing for her each knotty point; but I soon discovered that such help was regarded by my new pupil as degrading; she recoiled from it with a certain proud impatience.Hereupon I appointed her long lessons, and left her to solve alone any perplexities they might present.She set to the task with serious ardour, and having quickly accomplished one labour, eagerly demanded more.So much for her perseverance.As to her sense of duty, it evinced itself thus: she liked to learn, but hated to teach.Her progress as a pupil depended upon herself, and I saw that on herself she could calculate with certainty; her success as a teacher rested partly, perhaps chiefly, upon the will of others.It cost her a most painful effort to enter into conflict, with this foreign will, to endeavour to bend it into subjection to her own; for in what  regarded people in general the action of her will was impeded by many scruples.It was as unembarrassed as strong where her own affairs were concerned, and to it she could at any time subject her inclination, if that inclination went counter to her convictions of right; yet when called upon to wrestle with the propensities, the habits, the faults of others, of children especially, who are deaf to reason, and, for the most part, insensate to persuasion, her will sometimes almost refused to act; then came in the sense of duty, and forced the reluctant will into operation.A wasteful expense of energy and labour was frequently the consequence.Frances toiled for and with her pupils like a drudge, but it was long ere her conscientious exertions were rewarded by anything like docility on their part, because they saw that they had power over her, inasmuch as by resisting her painful attempts to convince, persuade, control—by forcing her to the employment of coercive measures—they could inflict upon her exquisite suffering.Human beings—human children especially—seldom deny themselves the pleasure of exercising a power which they are conscious of possessing, even though that power consist only in a capacity to make others wretched.A pupil whose sensations are duller than those of his instructor, while his nerves are tougher and his bodily strength perhaps greater, has an immense advantage over that instructor, and he will generally use it relentlessly, because the very young, very healthy, very thoughtless know neither how to sympathize nor how to spare.Frances, I fear, suffered much; a continual weight seemed to oppress her spirits.I have said she did not live in the house; and whether in her own abode, wherever that might be, she wore the same preoccupied, unsmiling sorrowfully resolved air that always shaded her features under the roof of Mdlle. Reuter, I could not tell."
"一天，我布置了一份作业，是关于艾尔弗雷德在一间牧人屋舍里照看蛋糕的老掉牙的小故事，那是一个扩写故事练习。真是非同寻常，大多数学生都完成了。但她们大多都写得很简洁。多数人的故事很让人莫名奇妙。只有西尔维和莱奥妮·勒德吕的故事还多少有点道理、有点联系。其实，厄拉利无意中使用了一个聪明的权宜之计，既保证了故事准确性，又免去了麻烦。不知怎么回事，她竟然得到了一本删节版的英国历史书，还把这段故事原封不动地誊抄了出来。我在她作业的空白处写上了“愚蠢、虚假”的评语，并沿着中间位置撕了下来。","One day I gave, as a devoir, the trite little anecdote of Alfred tending cakes in the herdsman’s hut, to be related with amplifications.A singular affair most of the pupils made of it.Brevity was what they had chiefly studied.The majority of the narratives were perfectly unintelligible.Those of Sylvie and Leonie Ledru alone pretended to anything like sense and connection.Eulalie, indeed, had hit upon a clever expedient for at once ensuring accuracy and saving trouble.She had obtained access somehow to an abridged history of England, and had copied the anecdote out fair.I wrote on the margin of her production, ‘Stupid and deceitful,’ and then tore it down the middle."
"就在那一叠单页的作业最后，我发现了一份有好几页的作业，这份作业书写整齐并缝制在一起。我认识那笔迹，不需要“弗朗西斯·埃文斯·亨利”的签名作为证据，我也不难确认自己对笔者身份的判断是正确的。","Last in the pile of single-leaved devoirs I found one of several sheets neatly written out and stitched together.I knew the hand, and scarcely needed the evidence of the signature ‘Frances Evans Henri’ to confirm my conjecture as to the writer’s identity."
"通常我会在夜间批阅学生作业，而我的房间也通常是我批阅作业的地方——这是我迄今为止最繁重的工作，当我剪掉烛花专心阅读那位可怜的老师的作业时，我感到一种前所未有的兴趣油然而生，这让我有些奇怪。","Night was my usual time for correcting devoirs, and my own room the usual scene of such task—task most onerous hitherto; and it seemed strange to me to feel rising within me an incipient sense of interest, as I snuffed the candle and addressed myself to the perusal of the poor teacher’s manuscript."
"“如今，”我想，“我终于可以一窥真正的她了；我也可以弄清她的天性和才能了。我并没有期望她能用外语很棒地表达自己的思想。相反，倘若她真有什么思想的话，那么从这里就可以表现出来。”","‘Now,’ thought I, ‘I shall see a glimpse of what she really is; I shall get an idea of the nature and extent of her powers.Not that she can be expected to express herself well in a foreign tongue; but still, if she has any mind, here will be a reflection of it.’"
"她的故事始于对一间撒克逊农舍的描写，那屋舍坐落在一片广阔的森林中，时值冬日，林中枝叶稀少。那是十二月的一个夜晚，雪片飘落，那牧人预感到一场特大暴风雪即将来临。他召唤妻子帮他去归拢羊群，它们仍徜徉在远处索恩河畔的牧场上。他提醒妻子说要到很晚才能回来。善良的妻子不愿抛下烘烤晚餐面包的活计，不过还得承认保护牛羊群才是首要任务。她穿好羊皮斗篷，嘱咐一位借宿的路人——他正半卧在炉边的灯心草铺成的床上休息——在他们回来之前留心着面包。","The narrative commenced by a description of a Saxon peasant’s hut, situated within the confines of a great, leafless, winter forest.It represented an evening in December; flakes of snow were falling, and the herdsman foretold a heavy storm.He summoned his wife to aid him in collecting their flock, roaming far away on the pastoral banks of the Thone; he warns her that it will be late ere they return.The good woman is reluctant to quit her occupation of baking cakes for the evening meal; but acknowledging the primary importance of securing the herds and flocks, she puts on her sheepskin mantle, and addressing a stranger who rests half reclined on a bed of rushes near the hearth, bids him mind the bread till her return."
"“要当心，年轻人，”　她继续说，“我们走后你要锁好门，最要紧的是，我们不在时不要给任何人开门。无论听到什么都不要动，也不要朝外看。天很快就要黑了，这片林子最荒凉偏僻了，日落后常常会有奇怪的声响，狼群常常出没在林间空地，丹麦的武士们也常常侵扰这一带。更恐怖的事情你都会听到。兴许你偶尔会听到，就像传闻的那样，有小孩在哭，倘若你去开门救他，就会有一头巨大的黑牛或者一条幽灵般的妖狗冲进门槛；更可怕的是，要是有像翅膀拍打窗棂那样的东西，接着又有一只大乌鸦或者一只白鸽飞进屋，停落在壁炉上，这等造访者对我们家来说定是一种厄运的征兆。所以啊，记住我的话，不管发生什么都别打开门闩。”","‘Take care, young man,’ she continues, ‘that you fasten the door well after us; and above all, open to none in our absence.Whatever sound you hear, stir not, and look not out. The night will soon fall; this forest is most wild and lonely; strange noises are often heard therein after sunset; wolves haunt these glades, and Danish warriors infest the country.Worse things are talked of.You might chance to hear, as it were, a child cry, and on opening the door to afford it succour, a great black bull or a shadowy goblin dog might rush over the threshold; or, more awful still, if something flapped, as with wings, against the lattice, and then a raven or a white dove flew in and settled on the hearth, such a visitor would be a sure sign of misfortune to the house.Therefore heed my advice, and lift the latchet for nothing.’"
"丈夫叫着妻子，他们出发了。那陌生人独自在屋内听一会儿隐约的风雪声，又听一会儿遥远的涨河声，便说起话来。","Her husband calls her away; both depart.The stranger, left alone, listens awhile to the muffled snow-wind, the remote, swollen sound of the river, and then he speaks."
"“今晚是圣诞节前夜，”　他说，“我记得这日子。就在这粗制的灯心草草榻之上，我孤零零地坐着，避难于一位牧人家的屋舍中；我，堂堂王位的继承者，却要在一位穷苦的农奴家栖身过夜。我的王位被篡夺，我的皇冠落在一个侵略者的额头上。我没有任何朋友。我的军队在威尔士山落败而逃。野蛮的掠夺者们蹂躏着我的国家。我的臣民们被征服，躺卧在地，他们的胸口遭受着凶残的丹麦人的践踏。命运啊！你已使出了最恶毒的手段，如今你又手扶钝剑站我面前。唉！我看到你我目光对视；我还看到你质问我为何还活着，为何还怀有希望。你这个异教的魔鬼，我不信你是全能的，因此绝不屈服于你的力量。上帝啊，您的儿子，就如同今夜，化为人形，允诺为人类受难，为人类流血，住手吧，命运！没有上帝的旨意，你不能肆意妄为。上帝是清白的、永恒的、全智的——上帝，我信仰你，尽管我遭受你的剥夺，遭受你的压榨，尽管我赤身裸体、孤苦凄凉、回天乏术，但我并不绝望，也不能绝望。即便格斯拉姆的长矛浸染了我的鲜血，我也不该绝望。我注视着、挣扎着、憧憬着、祈祷着；耶和华会在他合适的时刻来助我一臂之力的。”","‘It is Christmas Eve,’ says he; ‘I mark the date.Here I sit alone on a rude couch of rushes, sheltered by the thatch of a herdsman’s hut; I, whose inheritance was a kingdom, owe my night’s harbourage to a poor serf.My throne is usurped, my crown presses the brow of an invader.I have no friends.My troops wander broken in the hills of Wales.Reckless robbers spoil my country.My subjects lie prostrate, their breasts crushed by the heel of the brutal Dane.Fate! thou hast done thy worst, and now thou standest before me resting thy hand on thy blunted blade.Ay; I see thine eye confront mine and demand why I still live, why I still hope.Pagan demon, I credit not thine omnipotence, and so cannot succumb to thy power.My God, whose Son, as on this night, took on Him the form of man, and for man vouchsafed to suffer and bleed, controls thy hand, and without His behest thou canst not strike a stroke.My God is sinless, eternal, all-wise—in Him is my trust; and though stripped and crushed, by thee, though naked, desolate, void of resource, I do not despair, I cannot despair.Were the lance of Guthrum now wet with my blood, I should not despair.I watch, I toil, I hope, I pray; Jehovah, in His own time, will aid.’"
"我无需再继续引用了。她的故事通篇都是同样的笔调。她的故事中有拼写错误，有外来的习语，也有结构方面的错误，还有不规则动词误用为规则动词的错误。如同以上例子所示，绝大部分篇幅都由短句和略微粗糙的句子组成，文体方面也急需润色和不断提高。然而，尽管这样，在我从教生涯里，我从未遇到过如此优秀的作品。这个女孩子的脑海里构思了一幅有那屋舍、两个农民和那位无冕国王的图画；她构想了那片冬日的森林，回顾了古老的撒克逊鬼怪传奇故事，赞颂了艾尔弗雷德罹难时的勇气，追忆了艾尔弗雷德所受的基督教教育，以及他当初依靠耶和华的帮助与传说命运抗争时固有的信心。这篇文章，是在她丝毫没有我的暗示的情况下完成的。我只给出了题目，但对于撰写的方式我却只字未提。","I need not continue the quotation; the whole devoir was in the same strain.There were errors of orthography, there were foreign idioms, there were some faults of construction, there were verbs irregular transformed into verbs regular.It was mostly made up, as the above example shows, of short and somewhat rude sentences, and the style stood in great need of polish and sustained dignity; yet such as it was I had hitherto seen nothing like it in the course of my professorial experience.The girl’s mind had conceived a picture of the hut, of the two peasants, of the crownless king; she had imagined the wintry forest; she had recalled the old Saxon ghost-legends; she had appreciated Alfred’s courage under calamity; she had remembered his Christian education, and had shown him, with the rooted confidence of those primitive days, relying on the scriptural Jehovah for aid against the mythological Destiny.This she had done without a hint from me. I had given the subject, but not said a word about the manner of treating it."
"“我打算寻找机会或者创造机会跟她谈谈，”我一边卷着那份作业，一边自言自语地说，“除了‘弗朗西斯·埃文斯’这个姓名之外，我还打算了解她对于英语掌握的其他情况。她在英语方面并非新手，这是有据可查的。然而，她却跟我讲她从未去过英格兰，也从未修过英文课程，更没有在英国的家庭里生活过。”","‘I will find or make an opportunity of speaking to her,’ I said to myself as I rolled the devoir up; ‘I will learn what she has of English in her besides the name of Frances Evans.She is no novice in the language, that is evident; yet she told me she had neither been in England, nor taken lessons in English, nor lived in English families.’"
"按照我的习惯，我在第二次上课过程中通报了其他学生的写作作业，对于个别的作业给予了些微的表扬和批评，因为严厉的批评是没用的，很高的赞誉却又不值。","In the course of my next lesson I made a report of the other devoirs, dealing out praise and blame in very small retail parcels, according to my custom, for there was no use in blaming severely, and high encomiums were rarely merited."
"对于亨利小姐的作业，我什么也没说。我戴上眼睛，竭力想从她脸上读出被我刻意忽视后的感伤。我想弄清在她的内心是否有一种关于自己天资的看法。“如果她认为自己在那篇作文中的确表现不错的话，那她现在定会现很懊悔。”我想。她的脸色严肃地如同往常，几乎是阴沉的；和先前一样，她双眼紧盯着面前打开的笔记本。当我结束对最后一份作业的简短评述之后，我感觉，她的神态中似有什么期待；我放下作业揉搓着手，吩咐她们拿出语法书，她的神态掠过某种微小的变化，似乎在此刻放弃了一丝愉快而兴奋的期望。她一直在等着讨论她颇有兴趣的东西。但是讨论并没有到来，于是期望便消退了，变得越来越小，越来越沮丧；可是，注意力迅速地填补了她的落寞，顷刻间修复了那反常的表情。可我还是感觉，不是看到，在整个上课的过程里，始终有种希望纠缠着她；如果她没有表现出痛苦，那是因为她不愿意表现出来。","I said nothing to Mdlle. Henri’s exercise, and, spectacles on nose, I endeavoured to decipher in her countenance her sentiments at the omission.I wanted to find out whether in her existed a consciousness of her own talents.‘If she thinks she did a clever thing in composing that devoir, she will now look mortified,’ thought I. Grave as usual, almost sombre, was her face; as usual her eyes were fastened on the cahier open before her.There was something, I thought, of expectation in her attitude, as I concluded a brief review of the last devoir; and when, casting it from me and rubbing my hands, I bade them take their grammars, some slight change did pass over her air and mien, as though she now relinquished a faint prospect of pleasant excitement.She had been waiting for something to be discussed in which she had a degree of interest.The discussion was not to come on, so expectation sank back, shrunk and sad; but attention, promptly filling up the void, repaired in a moment the transient collapse of feature.Still, I felt, rather than saw, during the whole course of the lesson, that a hope had been wrenched from her, and that if she did not show distress, it was because she would not. "
"四点，铃声响了，教室马上喧嚣骚动起来，我并没有拿上我的帽子起身离开讲台，只是静静地坐了一会儿。我注视着弗朗西斯。她正在往手提包里面装书。扣上包上的纽扣，她抬起了头。当我们目光相遇时，她向我文雅而恭敬地鞠了一躬，似乎是问候我下午好，便转身要走。","At four o’clock, when the bell rang and the room was in immediate tumult, instead of taking my hat and starting from the estrade, I sat still a moment.I looked at Frances.she was putting her books into her cabas.Having fastened the button, she raised her head.Encountering my eye, she made a quiet, respectful obeisance, as bidding good-afternoon, and was turning to depart."
"“到这里来。”我说着便抬起了手。她迟疑了一下。两间教室充斥着喧嚣声，她可能没听到我的话。我重复做了一下手势，她终于靠近了。她又一次在距离讲台半码的地方停了一下，看上去很羞怯的样子。她仍然不确定自己是否误解了我的意思。","‘Come here,’ said I, lifting my finger at the same time.She hesitated; she could not hear the words amidst the uproar now pervading both schoolrooms.I repeated the sign; she approached.Again she paused within half a yard of the estrade, and looked shy, and still doubtful whether she had mistaken my meaning."
"“走上前来。”我果断地说。这是应对无自信、易尴尬之人唯一可行的办法，我轻轻伸手拉她一下，很快就让她站在我希望她站立的位置——即我的课桌和窗户的中间，那里可以避免另一个班的人流穿过，也不会有人躲在她身后偷听。","‘Step up,’ I said, speaking with decision.It is the only way of dealing with diffident, easily-embarrassed characters; and with some slight manual aid I presently got her placed just where I wanted her to be—that is, between my desk and the window, where she was screened from the rush of the second division, and where no one could sneak behind her to listen."
"“坐吧。”我说着递给她一只小矮凳。她随后遵从我的意思坐了下来。我清楚我要做的会被认为是件很奇怪的事，其他的事我并不在意。弗朗西斯也很清楚，看她那不安和颤抖的表情，恐怕她非常在意。我从口袋里抽出那份卷着的练习作业。","‘Take a seat,’ I said, placing a tabouret.And I made her sit down.I knew what I was doing would be considered a very strange thing, and, what was more, I did not care.Frances knew it also, and, I fear, by an appearance of agitation and trembling, that she cared much.I drew from my pocket the rolled-up devoir."
"“我猜这是你的作业吧？”我用英语问道，因为我现在确定她能讲英语。","‘This is yours, I suppose?’ said I, addressing her in English, for I now felt sure she could speak English."
"“是的。”她清楚地回答，我打开作业，手里拿着铅笔按在作业上面，在她面前展开，我看她有些感动，可以说是，有些兴奋；她那沮丧的表情犹如遮掩在燃烧的烈日背后的乌云，盛开着笑容。","‘Yes,’ she answered distinctly; and as I unrolled it and laid it out flat on the desk before her with my hand upon it, and a pencil in that hand, I saw her moved, and, as it were, kindled; her depression beamed as a cloud might behind which the sun is burning."
"“这份作业有许多错误。”我说。“你需要几年的认真学习才能准确无误地进行英文写作。注意！我给你指出一些主要的缺点。”我从头到尾仔细地讲解，不忘每一处错误，标明为什么会错以及那些词或者短语本应如何书写。我从头到尾仔细地讲解，不忘每一处错误，标明为什么会错以及那些词或者短语本应如何书写。在我严肃的讲解过程中，她逐渐平静了下来。这时我又继续说道：","‘This devoir has numerous faults,’ said I.‘It will take you some years of careful study before you are in a condition to write English with absolute correctness.Attend! I will point out some principal defects.’ And I went through it carefully, noting every error, and demonstrating why they were errors, and how the words or phrases ought to have been written.And I went through it carefully, noting every error, and demonstrating why they were errors, and how the words or phrases ought to have been written.In the course of this sobering process she became calm.I now went on,—"
"“对于你文章的内容，亨利小姐，它很让我惊讶。我愉快地读了一遍，因为我从中的确看到了你的兴趣和想象力。兴趣和想象力并不是人类心智的最高天赋，尽管你已经拥有了——可能未能达到最高程度，但在某种程度上，已经让人望尘莫及了。那么，你或许需要拿出勇气来，培养上帝和自然赋予你的才华，不畏任何困苦，在身处不公正的压力之下，要认识到这些才能的优点和可贵之处，并从中获取无拘无束、充分的慰藉。”","‘As to the substance of your devoir, Mdlle. Henri, it has surprised me. I perused it with pleasure, because I saw in it some proofs of taste and fancy.Taste and fancy are not the highest gifts of the human mind, but such as they are you possess them—not probably in a paramount degree, but in a degree beyond what the majority can boast.You may, then, take courage; cultivate the faculties that God and nature have bestowed on you, and do not fear in any crisis of suffering, under any pressure of injustice, to drive free and full consolation from the consciousness of their strength and rarity.’"
"“优点和可贵之处！”我自言自语到。“唉，我的话可能说到了点子上。”　因为我抬头一看，太阳已然冲破了遮蔽的乌云，她的表情大变，眼睛里闪动着微笑——一种近乎得意的微笑。那表情似乎想说：","‘Strength and rarity!’ I repeated to myself; ‘ay, the words are probably true,’ for on looking up I saw the sun had dissevered its screening cloud, her countenance was transfigured, a smile shone in her eyes—a smile almost triumphant.It seemed to say,—"
"“你可是发现我这么多天性了，我真开心；你不必小心翼翼地节制你的辞令。你认为我自个儿还不了解自个儿吗？你讲的我的确有天分，我从孩提时代就已非常清楚了。”","‘I am glad you have been forced to discover so much of my nature; you need not so carefully moderate your language.Do you think I am myself a stranger to myself?What you tell me in terms so qualified I have known fully from a child.’"
"她那毫不掩饰的、闪亮的眼神的确说明了这点；可就在一瞬间，她脸上的光彩和喜悦就消退了。倘若她强烈地意识到了自己的天分，她也同样意识到了自己那令人烦恼的缺陷；这些意识消失了仅一秒钟，此刻又突然复活了，立刻便征服了她那太过活泼的性格，就是这些性格使她她对力量的感觉得以表露。她情感变化如此之快，我都没有时间用斥责她的方式验证一下她那份喜悦；可当我的眉头刚要紧缩一下时，她已变得严肃起来，表情严肃到了近乎忧伤的地步。","She did say this as plainly as a frank and flashing glance could, but in a moment the glow of her complexion, the radiance of her aspect, had subsided.If strongly conscious of her talents, she was equally conscious of her harassing defects; and the remembrance of these, obliterated for a single second, now reviving with sudden force, at once subdued the too vivid characters in which her sense of her powers had been expressed.So quick was the revulsion of feeling, I had not time to check her triumph by reproof; ere I could contract my brows to a frown she had become serious and almost mournful-looking."
"“谢谢您，先生。”她起身说到。她的声音和那一如往常的表情中都充满了感激。的确，我们的交谈是该结束了；当我环顾四周时，看到所有的寄宿生（走读生都已离去）都聚集着站在距我的课桌只有一两码的地方，大睁着眼睛，大张着嘴巴。三位女教师在一个角落里挤作一团，窃窃私语。女校长距我几乎一肘之隔，坐在一张低矮的椅子上，静静地为她那做好了的钱包修剪流苏。","‘Thank you, sir,’ said she, rising.There was gratitude both in her voice and in the look with which she accompanied it. It was time, indeed, for our conference to terminate; for, when I glanced around, behold all the boarders (the day-scholars had departed) were congregated within a yard or two of my desk, and stood staring with eyes and mouths wide open.The three maîtresses formed a whispering knot in one corner, and, close at my elbow, was the directness, sitting on a low chair, calmly clipping the tassels of her finished purse."
"第十七章","CHAPTER XVII"
"毕竟，我这次这么大胆地争取到和亨利小姐谈话的机会是有所收获的，但并不完满。除了想知道她的法语姓氏之外，我本打算问问她，弗朗西斯和埃文斯这两个英语受洗名是怎么得来的，还有那么纯正的口音是从哪儿学来的。但这两点让我统统给忘掉了，或者是因为，我们的谈话时间过短,我都没有时间向她发问。还有，我连她一半的英语口语水平都没有测试出来；我从她嘴里听到的英语仅仅是些诸如“是的”，“谢谢您，先生”之类的话。“没关系。”我答道，“现在没有谈完的改日再谈吧。”给自己的许诺总算没有落空，毕竟当着这么多学生的面，要想和哪位学生谈论某个特别的话题，就算几句，那也是困难的；可有一句古话这样讲：“有志者事竟成”，我接二连三地设法寻找机会，想和亨利小姐谈谈，顾不得每次靠近她时别人投来嫉妒的注视以及轻声的诋毁。","After all, I had profited but imperfectly by the opportunity I had so boldly achieved of speaking to Mdlle. Henri. It was my intention to ask her how she came to be possessed of two English baptismal names, Frances and Evans, in addition to her French surname, also whence she derived her good accent.I had forgotten both points, or rather our colloquy had been so brief that I had not had time to bring them forward.Moreover, I had not half tested her powers of speaking English; all I had drawn from her in that language were the words ‘Yes,’ and ‘Thank you, sir.’ ‘No matter,’ I reflected.‘What has been left incomplete now shall be finished another day.’ Nor did I fail to keep the promise thus made to myself It was difficult to get even a few words of particular conversation with one pupil among so many; but, according to the old proverb, ‘where there is a will there is a way;’ and again and again I managed to find an opportunity for exchanging a few words with Mdlle. Henri, regardless that envy stared and detraction whispered whenever I approached her."
"“把你的书拿过来一下。”这就是我惯常跟她开始简短谈话的方式。而时间总是选在恰好要下课的时候；我示意她站起来，自己坐在她的座位上，吩咐她恭敬地站在我的一侧；因为我认为对她而言，严格遵守正常的师生礼仪是明智的、没错的；并且，我觉得这样做的话，我的态度会相应地变得庄重威严，而她的态度也显得坦然自若一些——一般在这样的情况下，效果无疑是相反的，可是，事实就是这样。","‘Your book an instant.’ Such was the mode in which I often began these brief dialogues.The time was always just at the conclusion of the lesson; and motioning to her to rise, I installed myself in her place, allowing her to stand deferentially at my side, for I esteemed it wise and right in her case to enforce strictly all forms ordinarily in use between master and pupil, the rather because I perceived that in proportion as my manner grew austere and magisterial, hers became easy and self-possessed—an odd contradiction, doubtless, to the ordinary effect in such cases; but so it was."
"“给我支铅笔。”我伸出一只手，看都不看她地说。（现在我要简要描述一下我们这样第一次谈话时的情节。）她递给我一支铅笔，我一边划着她语法练习本上的部分错误，一边问她：","‘A pencil,’ said I, holding out my hand without looking at her. (I am now about to sketch a brief report of the first of these conferences.)She gave me one, and while I underlined some errors in a grammatical exercise she had written, I observed,—"
"“你不是比利时本地人？”","‘You are not a native of Belgium?’"
"“不是。”","‘No.’"
"“也不是法国人？”","‘Nor of France?’"
"“不是。”","‘No.’"
"“那么，你的出生地在哪里？”","‘Where, then, is your birthplace?’"
"“我出生在日内瓦。”","‘I was born at Geneva.’"
"“我想，你不会把弗朗西斯和埃文斯当作瑞士名字吧？”","‘You don’t call Frances and Evans Swiss names, I presume?’"
"“不会，先生。那是英语名字。”","‘No, sir; they are English names.’"
"“很对。日内瓦人习惯给孩子取英国名字吗？”","‘Just so; and is it the custom of the Genevese to give their children English appellatives?’"
"“不是，先生。可是——”","‘Non, monsieur; mais—’"
"“想讲英语就讲英语吧。”","‘Speak English, if you please.’"
"“可是——”","‘Mais—’"
"“英语——”","‘English—’"
"“不过，”（语气缓慢而带点尴尬）“我的父母并不所有都是日内瓦人。”","‘But’ (slowly and with embarrassment) ‘my parents were not all the two Genevese.’"
"“要说他们俩，不要说‘所有都’，小姐。”","‘Say both instead of “all the two,” mademoiselle.’"
"“他们并非都是瑞士人。我母亲是英国人。”","‘Not both Swiss.My mother was English.’"
"“啊！还是英国血统？”","‘Ah! and of English extraction?’"
"“是的。她的祖辈都是英国人。”","‘Yes; her ancestors were all English.’"
"“那你父亲呢？”","‘And your father?’"
"“他是瑞士人。”","‘He was Swiss.’"
"“还有什么？他的职业是什么？”","‘What besides?What was his profession?’"
"“教士——牧师——他有一座教堂。”","‘Ecclesiastic—pastor—he had a church.’"
"“既然你母亲是英国人，那你的英语怎么讲得并不很好呢？”","‘Since your mother is an Englishwoman, why do you not speak English with more facility?’"
"“母亲去世了，都十年了。”","‘Maman est morte, il y a dix ans.’"
"“那你就用忘记她的母语来纪念她啊。只要和我交谈，最好把法语忘掉——坚持用英语讲。”","‘And you do homage to her memory by forgetting her language.Have the goodness to put French out of your mind so long as I converse with you—keep to English.’"
"“先生，当一个人对它已不再习惯的时候，这太难了。”","‘C’est si difficile, monsieur, quand on n‘en a plus l’habitude.’"
"“我想，你以前有这种习惯吧？现在，用你的母语回答我的问题。”","‘You had the habitude formerly, I suppose?Now answer me in your mother tongue.’"
"“是，先生，我小的时候，讲英语要比法语多。”","‘Yes, sir, I spoke the English more than the French when I was a child.’"
"“但你现在为何不讲了呢？”","‘Why do you not speak it now?’"
"“因为我没有讲英语的朋友。”","‘Because I have no English friends.’"
"“我想，你跟你父亲一起过吧？”","‘You live with your father, I suppose?’"
"“我父亲也去世了。”","‘My father is dead.’"
"“你有兄弟姐妹吗？”","‘You have brothers and sisters?’"
"“一个都没有。”","‘Not one.’"
"“就你一个人过活？”","‘Do you live alone?’"
"“不是。我有一个姑妈叫朱利安娜。”","‘No; I have an aunt—ma tante Julienne.’"
"“她是你父亲的姐妹吗？”","‘Your father’s sister?’"
"“正是，先生。”","‘Justement, monsieur.’"
"“刚才这句是英文吗？”","‘Is that English?’"
"“不是，可我忘了啊。”","‘No, but I forget.’"
"“就为这一点，小姐，如果你是个孩子的话，我肯定会想出点办法小小惩罚你一下。在你这个年龄——我猜你肯定有二十二三岁了吧？”","‘For which, mademoiselle, if you were a child, I should certainly devise some slight punishment.At your age—you must be two or three and twenty, I should think?’"
"“还没有，先生——再有一个月就十九岁了。”","‘Pas encore, monsieur—en un mois j’aurai diX—neuf ans.’"
"“好啦，十九岁是该成熟的年龄了，既然到了这个年龄，你就该为自己的进步操心了；到该用英语的时候，就不需要老师提醒你两次讲英语的好处了。”","‘Well, nineteen is a mature age, and, having attained it, you ought to be so solicitous for your own improvement that it should not be needful for a master to remind you twice of the expediency of your speaking English whenever practicable.’"
"对于我这样高明的谈话，我并没有得到答案。可当我抬头看时，只见她在暗暗发笑，这笑容虽不是太过开心，但却意义深长。那笑容仿佛在说，“他谈的都是他不了解的事。”这意思被她的笑容表现得再明显不过了，于是我决心要搞清她是怎样从我的漏洞中默然认定我不了解她的。","To this wise speech I received no answer; and when I looked up, my pupil was smiling to herself a much-meaning though not very gay smile.It seemed to say, ‘He talks of he knows not what.’It said this so plainly that I determined to request information on the point concerning which my ignorance seemed to be thus tacitly affirmed."
"“你真在为你的成长操心吗？”","‘Are you solicitous for your own improvement?’"
"“相当操心。”","‘Rather.’"
"“你如何才能证明这一点呢，小姐？”","‘How do you prove it, mademoiselle?’"
"这是一个奇怪的问题，而且是单刀直入地提出，引得她又一次发笑。“怎么，先生，我并非不操心——不是吗？我功课学得很好。”","An odd question and bluntly put; it excited a second smile.‘Why, monsieur, I am not inattentive—am I?I learn my lessons well.’"
"“哦，任何一个孩子都能做到！你还做了什么吗？”","‘Oh, a child can do that!And what more do you do?’"
"“我还能做些什么呢？”","‘What more can I do?’"
"“哦，当然不是很多。可你毕竟是老师，也还是学生，对吧？","‘Oh, certainly, not much.But you are a teacher, are you not, as well as a pupil?’"
"“是这样的。”","‘Yes.’"
"“你教授花边缝补课吗？”","‘You teach lace-mending?’"
"“是的。”","‘Yes.’"
"“这是一件无味又烦人的工作。你喜欢吗？","‘A dull, stupid occupation.Do you like it?’"
"“当然不了，这工作很乏味。”","‘No; it is tedious.’"
"“可你为何还要继续干呢？你为何不去教授历史、地理、语法甚至是算术课呢？”","‘Why do you pursue it?Why do you not rather teach history, geography, grammar, even arithmetic?’"
"“先生肯定我完全熟悉这些学科吗？”","‘Is monsieur certain that I am myself thoroughly acquainted with these studies?’"
"“我不肯定。按照你现在的年龄，应该熟悉才是。”","‘I don’t know.You ought to be at your age.’"
"“可我从来没上过学，先生。”","‘But I never was at school, monsieur.’"
"“当真！那，你的朋友们是干什么的——你姑妈是怎么搞的？这事真应该怪你姑妈。”","‘Indeed!What, then, were your friends—what was your aunt about?She is very much to blame.’"
"“不，先生，不是这样的。我姑妈很好——这不能怪她——她已经尽了她所能，她供我住宿，供我吃饭。”（我转述的是亨利小姐的原话，就这样她从逐句把法语翻译成了英语。）“我姑妈并不富裕。她每年仅有一千二百法郎的养老金，叫她供我上学是不可能的。”","‘No, monsieur, no; my aunt is good—she is not to blame—she does what she can; she lodges and nourishes me.’ (I report Mdlle. Henri’s phrases literally, and it was thus she translated from the French).‘She is not rich; she has only an annuity of twelve hundred francs, and it would be impossible for her to send me to school.’"
"“也是啊。”听到这些话，我心里暗想。但我用了一种武断的口吻接着说：","‘Rather,’ thought I to myself on hearing this, but I continued, in the dogmatical tone I had adopted,—"
"“不过，你长这么大，竟然连最一般的学科都没有学过过，真是太可悲了。要是你懂点历史或者语法的话，你可能会慢慢儿不用做这种缝补花边儿的苦差事，进而改善你的社会地位。”","‘It is sad, however, that you should be brought up in ignorance of the most ordinary branches of education.Had you known something of history and grammar you might, by degrees, have relinquished your lace-mending drudgery, and risen in the world.’"
"“这正是我打算做的。”","‘It is what I mean to do.’"
"“你怎么打算的？就凭你只懂点儿英语？那是不够的。没有哪个体面的家庭会请一位就懂得一门外语，其他什么知识都不懂的女家庭教师的。”","‘How?By a knowledge of English alone?That will not suffice.No respectable family will receive a governess whose whole stock of knowledge consists in a familiarity with one foreign language.’"
"“先生，我还懂别的呢。”","‘Monsieur, I know other things.’"
"“对，你说得没错。你会编织柏林毛线织品，还会绣手帕和衣领；可那对你没有什么用。”","‘Yes, yes; you can work with Berlin wools, and embroider handkerchiefs and collars; that will do little for you.’"
"亨利小姐嘴唇张开想说什么，但她忍住了。她似乎在想这次谈话已经进行得很充分了，所以就保持沉默。","Mdlle. Henri’s lips were unclosed to answer, but she checked herself, as thinking the discussion had been sufficiently pursued, and remained silent."
"“说话啊。”我不耐烦地继续说。“我从不喜欢心里不服，表面却顺从的样子；你的反驳意见就在舌根儿上呢。”","‘Speak,’ I continued impatiently.‘I never like the appearance of acquiescence when the reality is not there; and you had a contradiction at your tongue’s end.’"
"“先生，我曾经学过许多科目，如语法、历史、地理和算术等。每一门课程我都学完了。”","‘Monsieur, I have had many lessons both in grammar, history, geography, and arithmetic.I have gone through a course of each study.’"
"“好哇！可既然你姑妈供不起你去上学，你又是如何做到的呢？”","‘Bravo!But how did you manage it, since your aunt could not afford to send you to school?’"
"“缝补花边儿，先生就这么瞧不起啊。”","‘By lace-mending; by the thing monsieur despises so much.’"
"“没错！现在，亨利小姐，用英语来解释一下你是如何用这手艺来达到这个目的的，这可是一个不错的锻炼机会。","‘Truly!And now, mademoiselle, it will be a good exercise for you to explain to me in English how such a result was produced by such means."
"“先生，我一到布鲁塞尔就央求姑妈让我学习缝补花边儿，因为我知道干这行也是一种职业——一种容易学的职业，可以能很快赚点钱的职业。没几天我就学会了。很快我就开始工作了，原因是那些布鲁塞尔的太太们都有老式的花边儿——很是珍贵——这花边儿每洗一回就得缝补。我赚了点钱，就用这些钱去支付方才提到的那几门学科的学费。其中有些钱我花在了买书上面——特别是英文书籍。我会用英语写作与交谈时，就想尽快找份女家庭教师或学校教师的工作，但是那太难了，因为那些知道我缝补花边儿的身份的人会鄙视我，就像这里的学生鄙视我那样。不过，我自有主意。”她又轻声地补了一句。","‘Monsieur, I begged my aunt to have me taught lace-mending soon after we came to Brussels, because I knew it was a métier—a trade—which was easily learned, and by which I could earn some money very soon.I learned it in a few days; and I quickly got work, for all the Brussels ladies have old lace—very precious—which must be mended all the times it is washed.I earned money a little, and this money I gave for lessons in the studies I have mentioned.Some of it I spent in buying books—English books especially.Soon I shall try to find a place of governess, or schoolteacher, when I can write and speak English well; but it will be difficult, because those who know I have been a lace-mender will despise me, as the pupils here despise me.Pourtant j’ai mon projet,’ she added in a lower tone."
"“什么主意？”","‘What is it?’"
"“我打算前往英格兰，并在那里住下来，在那儿教法语。”","‘I will go and live in England; I will teach French there.’"
"这几句话说得很重。她说“英格兰”时的语气，能让你联想到摩西时代以色列人提到迦南时的语气一样。","The words were pronounced emphatically.She said ‘England’ as you might suppose an Israelite of Moses’ days would have said Canaan."
"“你希望去英格兰看看吗？”","‘Have you a wish to see England?’"
"“是的，是我一个打算。”","‘Yes, and an intention.’"
"这时，有一个声音，女校长的声音，插了进来：","And here a voice, the voice of the directress, interposed,—"
"“亨利小姐，我看就要下雨了，你还是赶紧回家的好，我的朋友。”","‘Mademoiselle Henri, je crois qu’il va pleuvoir; vous feriez bien, ma bonne amie, de retourner chez vous tout de suite.’"
"亨利小姐默不做声，对这般多管闲事的提醒没有一句感谢之词。把书收了起来。","In silence, without a word of thanks for this officious warning, Mdlle. Henri collected her books."
"她尊敬地走到我跟前，又努力地走到她的上司跟前，虽说她的努力几乎并不成功，因为她似乎连头都不想点一下。就这样，她离去了。","She moved to me respectfully, endeavoured to move to her superior, though the endeavour was almost a failure, for her head seemed as if it would not bend, and thus departed."
"显然，凡是一个人的性格里稍有一丝刚毅和倔强，任何小小的困难都会刺激它而非抑制它。勒泰小姐原本可以不必自讨麻烦地提醒亨利小姐快要下雨的（顺便说一句，事实证明勒泰小姐的预言是错误的，那天晚上并没有下雨）。就在第二天上课结束时，我又来到了亨利小姐的桌前。","Where there is one grain of perseverance or wilfulness in the composition, trifling obstacles are ever known rather to stimulate than discourage.Mdlle. Reuter might as well have spared herself the trouble of giving that intimation about the weather (by-the-bye, her prediction was falsified by the event; it did not rain that evening).At the close of the next lesson I was again at Mdlle. Henri’s desk."
"于是我便以这种方式跟她搭讪：","Thus did I accost her,—"
"“你认为英格兰怎么样，小姐？为什么你想去那儿？”","‘What is your idea of England, mademoiselle?Why do you wish to go there?’"
"这次，亨利小姐习惯了我这种蓄意唐突的发问方式，没再让她感到慌乱和吃惊，只是她的回答带着些许迟疑；这种迟疑似乎是因为她必须当场把自己的思维从法语转换为英语。","Accustomed by this time to the calculated abruptness of my manner, it no longer discomposed or surprised her, and she answered with only so much of hesitation as was rendered inevitable by the difficulty she experienced in improvising the translation of her thoughts from French to English."
"“就像我听到的、读到的那样，英格兰是一个独特的国家。我对英格兰的看法模糊不清，所以打算去那儿让自己的看法清晰明朗起来。”","‘England is something unique, as I have heard and read.My idea of it is vague, and I want to go there to render my idea clear, definite.’"
"“哦！如果你以教师的身份去那儿，那你觉得你对英格兰能了解多少呢？好奇怪的想法啊，你必须对一个国家有一个清晰明确的看法！你对大不列颠所有的认识可能是某个学校的内部，或者，充其量只是一两家私人的住宅而已。”","‘Hum!How much of England do you suppose you could see if you went there in the capacity of a teacher?A strange notion you must have of getting a clear and definite idea of a country!All you could see of Great Britain would be the interior of a school, or at most of one or two private dwellings.’"
"“或许是某个英国的学校，或许是英国人的住宅。”","‘It would be an English school; they would be English dwellings.’"
"“不可否认。可那又如何呢？在如此狭隘的范围内所做的观察又会有什么价值呢？” “先生，难道一个人就不能通过类比来学习吗？通过一个——标本——一件样本，通常可以了解全部。再说了，狭隘和广泛只是说说的话，是相对的，难道不对吗？在您的眼里，我的一生或许看起来都是狭窄的。那么一只——生活在地下的小动物——鼹鼠的一生——那您该作何评论呢？”","‘Indisputably.but what then?What would be the value of observations made on a scale so narrow?’ ‘Monsieur, might not one learn something by analogy?An—échantillon—a—a sample often serves to give an idea of the whole.besides, narrow and wide are words, comparative, are they not?All my life would perhaps seem narrow in your eyes.All the life of a—that little animal subterranean—une taupe—comment dit-on?’"
"“鼹鼠。”","‘Mole.’"
"“没错。地下生活的鼹鼠在我看来也是很狭隘的。”","‘Yes; a mole, which lives underground, would seem narrow even to me.’"
"“就算这样，小姐，然后呢？接着讲。”","‘Well, mademoiselle, what then?Proceed.’"
"“可是先生，您明白我的意思。”","‘Mais, monsieur, vous me comprenez.’"
"“一点儿都不清楚。烦劳解释一下。”","‘Not in the least.Have the goodness to explain.’"
"“哎哟，先生，就是这样一回事。在瑞士，我做事很少，学到的很少，看到的也很少。我在那儿生活在一个圆圈里。每天我只能在同一个圆圈里面走来走去，但却走不出去。就算我生活在那里——待在那儿一直到死——我也不会让那个圆变大，因为我既贫穷又没有技艺，更没有什么大学问。在我十分厌倦这个圆圈之后，我央求姑妈带我去布鲁塞尔。我在这里的生活圈子并没有扩大，因为我既不是富人也不是高贵的人；我仍然在同样狭隘的范围里活动，但情形却有了变化。如果我去了英格兰，我的生活圈还会变的。我清楚有关日内瓦资产阶级的情况；如今，我明白了布鲁塞尔资产阶级的情况。如果我去伦敦，我也会对伦敦资产阶级有所了解的。您能明白我所说的吗，先生，或者，你认为我的回答很不清楚吗？”","‘Why, monsieur, it is just so. In Switzerland I have done but little, learned but little, and seen but little.My life there was in a circle.I walked the same round every day; I could not get out of it.Had I rested—remained there even till my death—I should never have enlarged it, because I am poor and not skilful; I have not great acquirements.When I was quite tired of this round, I begged my aunt to go to Brussels.My existence is no larger here, because I am no richer or higher; I walk in as narrow a limit, but the scene is changed.It would change again if I went to England.I knew something of the bourgeois of Geneva; now I know something of the bourgeois of Brussels.If I went to London, I should know something of the bourgeois of London.Can you make any sense out of what I say, monsieur, or is it all obscure?’"
"“我明白了，明白了。那么，就让我们换个话题吧。你意在投身于教育，可你却是最不成功的教师；你没有办法维持学生上课的课堂秩序。”","‘I see, I see.Now let us advert to another subject.You propose to devote your life to teaching, and you are a most unsuccessful teacher; you cannot keep your pupils in order.’"
"这严厉的话语让她感到一阵痛苦不安。她低下头面对着课桌，但很快就抬了起来，回答说：","A flush of painful confusion was the result of this harsh remark.She bent her head to the desk; but soon raising it, replied,—"
"“先生，我不擅长教学，这是事实；不过，锻炼总会有进步的。还有，我的工作是有难处的。在这儿，我只教缝补课程。我不会在缝补花边儿上显示实力，也不会显现优势；这是一种不重要的手工艺。在这个学校，我没有伙伴，我很孤独。我又是个异教徒，这让我失去了影响力。”","‘Monsieur, I am not a skilful teacher, it is true, but practice improves; besides, I work under difficulties.Here I only teach sewing.I can show no power in sewing, no superiority; it is a subordinate art.Then I have no associates in this house; I am isolated.I am too a heretic, which deprives me of influence.’"
"“在英格兰你就是个外国人；这也会让你失去影响力，也会让你与世隔绝的。在英格兰，你的伙伴会更少，你也会像在这里一样无足轻重。”","‘And in England you would be a foreigner; that too would deprive you of influence, and would effectually separate you from all round you.In England you would have as few connections, as little importance as you have here.’"
"“但我毕竟会学到点什么的。至于其他方面，我可能会遇到与这里同样的困难；如果我非得抗争，也可能会被征服，我宁愿屈从于英格兰人的傲慢，也不愿屈从与佛兰芒人的粗俗。还有，先生——”","‘But I should be learning something.For the rest, there are probably difficulties for such as I everywhere; and if I must contend, and perhaps be conquered, I would rather submit to English pride than to Flemish coarseness.Besides, monsieur—’"
"她停了下来——很明显，原因并非是难以找到适当语言来表达自己，而是因为她的谨慎似乎在告诉她：“你说的够多了。”","She stopped—not evidently from any difficulty in finding words to express herself, but because discretion seemed to say, ‘You have said enough.’"
"“说完你的话。”我鼓励她。","‘Finish your phrase,’ I urged."
"“还有就是，先生，我渴望还能和清教徒们生活。他们要比天主教徒们更加诚实。可恶的天主教学校，墙壁多孔，地板中空，顶棚虚设。这栋房子的每间屋子，先生，都有视孔和听孔。学校如此，居住的人也是如此——太奸诈了。他们统统认为撒谎是合法的；他们统统声称，对自己厌恶的人表示友谊是礼貌的。”","‘Besides, monsieur, I long to live once more among Protestants; they are more honest than Catholics.A Romish school is a building with porous walls, a hollow floor, a false ceiling.Every room in this house, monsieur, has eye-holes and ear-holes, and what the house is the inhabitants are—very treacherous.They all think it lawful to tell lies; they all call it politeness to profess friendship where they feel hatred.’"
"“统统？”我问。“你指的是那些学生们——她们只不过是些孩子——未谙世事，做事不稳健的孩子，那些还未曾学会辨别是非的孩子们吗？”","‘All?’ said I.‘You mean the pupils—the mere children—inexperienced, giddy things, who have not learned to distinguish the difference between right and wrong?’"
"“正好相反，先生，那些孩子倒是最真诚的。”他们还不曾来得及学会欺诈。他们会撒谎，但他们撒起谎来还很幼嫩，你知道他们在撒谎；可大人们就虚伪得多了。他们欺骗外地人，更尔虞我诈。","‘On the contrary, monsieur, the children are the most sincere.They have not yet had time to become accomplished in duplicity.They will tell lies, but they do it inartificially and you know they are lying; but the grown-up people are very false.They deceive strangers, they deceive each other."
"一位仆人恰好走了进来。","A servant here entered."
"“亨利小姐，勒泰小姐想请您把多洛多家的小姑娘送到家去。她在门房罗莎莉那儿等您——因为她的保姆没来接她。”","‘Mdlle. Henri, Mdlle. Reuter vous prie de vouloir bien conduire la petite de Dorlodot chez elle.Elle vous attend dans le cabinet de Rosalie la portiÃ¨re—c’est que sa borne n‘est pas venue la chercher - voyez-vous.’"
"“好啊！这么说我就是她的保姆了？”亨利小姐追问道。接着，她笑了，笑容里带着以往的苦涩和嘲弄；这样的笑，我曾经在她的嘴唇上看到过，她匆匆站起身，出去了。","‘Eh bien!est-ce que je suis sa bonne-moi?’ demanded Mdlle. Henri;then smiling with that same bitter, derisive smile I had seen on her lips once before, she hastily rose and made her exit."
"第十八章","CHAPTER XVIII"
"显然这个年轻的英瑞混血儿从她的母语学习中既获得了快乐，又有了收益。当然在教她时我并没有局限于一般学校的常规方式。我把教英语作为教文学的渠道。我为她规定了一门阅读课程。她有一小套英国文学名著选读，其中不多几本是她母亲留给她的，其他的都是她用自己的零花钱买的。我又借给了她一些现代作品。她迫不及待地读着这些书，每当读完一本，就会写清楚的摘要给我。她也喜欢作文。这些事情似乎占据了她所有的时间；不久后，她那有所进步的作品迫使我坦率承认，原先她那些我称之为爱好与幻想的品质，现在应该称作鉴赏力与想象力。我如往常一样用干瘪而克制的语言暗示了对她的嘉许，并去找寻以往我的一句赞扬话就能引得她容光焕发、欢欣鼓舞的微笑时，弗朗西斯却红了脸。即使她真的笑了，也笑得十分恬淡羞涩，她没有如征服者般地抬头瞥视我，而是把目光停留在我手上，我的手正从她的肩膀上伸过去，拿着一支铅笔在作业本空白处写着一些评语。","The young Anglo-Swiss evidently derived both pleasure and profit from the study of her mother-tongue.In teaching her I did not, of course, confine myself to the ordinary school routine.I made instruction in English a channel for instruction in literature.I prescribed to her a course of reading.She had a little selection of English classics, a few of which had been left her by her mother, and the others she had purchased with her own penny-fee.I lent her some more modern works.All these she read with avidity, giving me, in writing, a clear summary of each work when she had perused it.Composition, too, she delighted in.Such occupation seemed the very breath of her nostrils, and soon her improved productions wrung from me the avowal that those qualities in her I had termed taste and fancy ought rather to have been denominated judgment and imagination.When I intimated so much, which I did as usual in dry and stinted phrase, I looked for the radiant and exulting smile my one word of eulogy had elicited before; but Frances coloured.If she did smile, it was very softly and shyly; and instead of looking up to me with a conquering glance, her eyes rested on my hand, which, stretched over her shoulder, was writing some directions with a pencil on the margin of her book."
"“恩，我对你的进步很满意，你开心吗？”我问道。","‘Well, are you pleased that I am satisfied with your progress?’ I asked."
"“是的。”她缓慢轻柔地回答道，那已褪了一半的红晕又涌回脸颊。","‘Yes,’ said she slowly, gently, the blush that had half subsided returning."
"“我想，是不是我说得不够多？”我继续说道，“我的表扬太过平淡了。”","‘But I do not say enough, I suppose“ I continued.‘My praises are too cool.’"
"她没有回答，我想她看起来有点难过。我揣测了她的想法，如果迎合她的想法有什么好处的话，我还是很愿意做的。此时她并不很想赢得我的欣赏，也不急于要我对她赞叹不已，只要我透露出一点柔情——哪怕只有一点点——也比全世界所有的赞颂更令她高兴。想到这里，我在她的身后又站了好一会，一直在她作业本的空白处写着。我几乎不能挪动我的位置，也无法停止写字。有一种东西使我俯在那里，我的头离她的头很近，我的手离她的手也很近；但是作业本上的空白并不是无限的——那位女校长无疑也是那么想的，于是，她便趁机从我身边走过，想看看我在耍什么花招，就那么点空白我却写了那么久。我必须要走了。这真令人厌恶——不得不放下我们最喜欢干的事。","She made no answer, and, I thought, looked a little sad.I divined her thoughts, and should much have liked to have responded to them, had it been expedient so to do. She was not now very ambitious of my admiration, not eagerly desirous of dazzling me; a little affection—ever so little—pleased her better than all the panegyrics in the world.Feeling this, I stood a good while behind her, writing on the margin of her book.I could hardly quit my station or relinquish my occupation.Something retained me bending there, my head very near hers, and my hand near hers too; but the margin of a copy-book is not an illimitable space—so, doubtless, the directress thought; and she took occasion to walk past, in order to ascertain by what art I prolonged so disproportionately the period necessary for filling it.I was obliged to go.Distasteful effort—to leave what we most prefer."
"弗朗西斯没有因为久坐而显得苍白无力；也许是因为这种状态传递到她大脑的刺激抵消了久坐不动给身体带来的疲劳。她确实变了——明显而迅速地变了，但是变得更好。我第一次见到她时，她表情阴翳，面无血色，看起来像是一个不会快乐的人，彷佛这世上任何地方都没有能让她幸福的事情。如今，那层阴云已经从她的脸上散去，取而代之的是希望与兴趣的曙光，这些感情如同晴朗的早晨般涌出来，使原先受压抑的灵魂获得生气，使本来苍白的脸庞多了几分色彩。起初我并不知道她眼睛的颜色，它们因为含着的压抑的泪水而显得浑浊，因为无尽的沮丧而显得暗淡。而今，她的眼睛已被一束暖人心房的阳光照亮，显露出那明亮的淡褐色双眸——那眸子大而饱满，被长长的睫毛遮掩着，瞳孔里充满着热情。她那因焦虑和消沉而显得心事重重的瘦长脸庞上总是显现着病态的憔悴；现如今，这些已经离她而去，透亮的皮肤几乎如花般盛开，丰腴的面容亦软化了原本生硬的脸部线条。她的身材也随之得到了改善。她圆润了些，整个人因此看上去更协调，加之她身高适中，所以尽管仍然纤细，也并不使人（起码是我）为她的轮廓欠缺饱满而感到遗憾，因为她依旧紧实，优雅，灵巧。她的腰肢、手腕、纤手、玉足以及脚踝转动起来那样优美，完全达到了我心中的匀称美；她的动作轻盈飘逸，正契合了我对于优雅的理解。","Frances did not become pale or feeble in consequence of her sedentary employment; perhaps the stimulus it communicated to her mind counterbalanced the inaction it imposed on her body.She changed, indeed—changed obviously and rapidly; but it was for the better.When I first saw her, her countenance was sunless, her complexion colourless; she looked like one who had no source of enjoyment, no store of bliss anywhere in the world.Now the cloud had passed from her mien, leaving space for the dawn of hope and interest, and those feelings rose like a clear morning, animating what had been depressed, tinting what had been pale.Her eyes, whose colour I had not at first known, so dim were they with repressed tears, so shadowed with ceaseless dejection, now, lit by a ray of the sunshine that cheered her heart, revealed irids of bright hazel—irids large and full, screened with long lashes, and pupils instinct with fire.That look of wan emaciation which anxiety or low spirits often communicates to a thoughtful, thin face, rather long than round, having vanished from hers, a clearness of skin almost bloom and a plumpness almost embonpoint softened the decided lines of her features.Her figure shared in this beneficial change.It became rounder; and as the harmony of her form was complete and her stature of the graceful middle height, one did not regret (or at least I did not regret) the absence of confirmed fullness in contours still slight, though compact, elegant, flexible.The exquisite turning of waist, wrist, hand, foot, and ankle satisfied completely my notions of symmetry, and allowed a lightness and freedom of movement which corresponded with my ideas of grace."
"就这样，亨利小姐进步了，苏醒了，她开始以一种新的姿态出现在学校里。她的精神力量缓慢而稳定地展现出来，不久就连那些妒火中烧的人也不得不对她另眼相看；当那些年轻健康的女子们看到她居然也能灿烂地微笑、欢乐地交谈、轻盈快活地四处走动时，也承认她是个“年轻健康的好姐妹”，于是勉强将她视为同类中的一员了。","Thus improved, thus wakened to life, Mdlle. Henri began to take a new footing in the school.Her mental power manifested gradually but steadily, ere long extorted recognition even from the envious; and when the young and healthy saw that she could smile brightly, converse gaily, move with vivacity and alertness, they acknowledged in her a sisterhood of youth and health, and tolerated her as of their kind accordingly."
"说真话，我就像园丁注视着一棵珍稀植物成长一样关注着她的变化，为此我也倾注了心血，正如园丁为自己心爱植物的成长付出了汗水。对我而言，要了解怎样才能最好地培养她，关心她那枯竭的感情，并引导她表现出那一直饱受暗无阳光、干旱笼罩和狂风摧残而不能展现的内在活力，这一切都并非难事。我一直默默无闻地、警惕地对她关心有加，总是伴其左右，在严厉粗糙的外表掩饰下，仅凭偶尔关心的一瞥或者一句诚恳温和的话语表示真心，在专横的面具下，用真诚的尊重引导并督促她的行为，同时全心全意且谨慎地帮助她——这些就是我所使用的方法，因为这最适合弗朗西斯的性情，她既骄傲又害羞，既敏感又深沉。","To speak truth, I watched this change much as a gardener watches the growth of a precious plant, and I contributed to it too, even as the said gardener contributes to the development of his favourite.To me it was not difficult to discover how I could best foster my pupil, cherish her starved feelings, and induce the out-ward manifestation of that inward vigour which sunless drought and blighting blast had hitherto forbidden to expand.Constancy of attention, a kindness as mute as watchful, always standing by her, cloaked in the rough garb of austerity, and making its real nature known only by a rare glance of interest or a cordial and gentle word; real respect masked with seeming imperiousness, directing, urging her actions, yet helping her too, and that with devoted care,— these were the means I used, for these means best suited Frances’ feelings, as susceptible as deep-vibrating, her nature at once proud and shy."
"她作为老师的行为风格也改变了，由此可见，我这一套教育方法有明显的益处。如今她在上课时神采奕奕，表情坚定地坐在学生们中间，使她们立即明白她这是要她们规矩行事。她们也确实听话了。她们发觉对她失去了控制力。再有哪个女生捣蛋，她也不再会放在心上。因为她拥有了一个她们无法耗尽的自我安慰的源泉，一根她们无法推倒的精神支柱。以前，如果她们欺负她，她只有哭泣；而今，她一笑而过。","The benefits of my system became apparent also in her altered demeanour as a teacher.She now took her place amongst her pupils with an air of spirit and firmness which assured them at once that she meant to be obeyed, and obeyed she was.They felt they had lost their power over her.If any girl had rebelled, she would no longer have taken her rebellion to heart.She possessed a source of comfort they could not drain, a pillar of support they could not overthrow.Formerly, when insulted, she wept; now, she smiled."
"她的一篇作品被当众朗读，大家一下子意识到了她的才华。我还记得那个主题——那是一个移民写给故乡朋友们的一封信。文章开头简洁。几行自然而形象的描写，向读者展示了一幅由原始森林和新大陆大河构成的画面——河上没有帆船和旗帜——这封信应该就是在这场景中写的。信中，尽管亨利小姐只用寥寥数笔就暗示了移民者生活中遇到的重重险阻，但字里行间移民者的决心、耐心与努力使人读之如闻其声。文中暗示了迫使他背井离乡的灾难，并描写了他毫无瑕疵的荣誉感、不屈不挠的独立精神以及坚不可摧的自尊心。还回忆了过去的时光，触及了分离的痛苦以及人在异乡的惆怅；通篇用动人的文笔流露着强烈而细腻的感情。结尾处写到一丝安慰：宗教信仰与移民者的动人叙述融为一体。","The public reading of one of her devoirs achieved the revelation of her talents to all and sundry.I remember the subject—it was an emigrant’s letter to his friends at home.It opened with simplicity.Some natural and graphic touches disclosed to the reader the scene of virgin forest and great New World river—barren of sail and flag—amidst which the epistle was supposed to be indited.The difficulties and dangers that attend a settler’s life were hinted at; and in the few words said on that subject, Mdlle. Henri failed not to render audible the voice of resolve, patience, endeavour.The disasters which had driven him from his native country were alluded to; stainless honour, inflexible independence, indestructible self-respect there took the word.Past days were spoken of; the grief of parting, the regrets of absence, were touched upon; feeling, forcible and fine, breathed eloquent in every period.At the close, consolation was suggested; religious faith became there the speaker, and she spoke well."
"作品通篇气势磅礴，语言朴实高雅，生动活泼的风格中不失优雅协调。","The devoir was powerfully written in language at once chaste and choice, in a style nerved with vigour and graced with harmony."
"当着勒泰小姐的面读或者说英语，她还是完全听得懂的，虽然她自己既不会讲也不会写。在我读亨利小姐的这篇作品时，她一直安静地坐在那里忙着，眼睛和手指一会忙着织领饰，一会忙着在一方麻纱手帕四周编花边。她什么都没说，脸和前额只表达出一丝不满的神情，双唇也不吐露一句评论。她的表情既没有吃惊、高兴和赞许，也没有任何兴趣或者蔑视、嫉妒、恼怒和厌倦；如果这种捉摸不透的态度说明了什么，那也仅是在说：","Mdlle. Reuter was quite sufficiently acquainted with English to understand it when read or spoken in her presence, though she could neither speak nor write it herself.During the perusal of this devoir she sat placidly busy, her eyes and fingers occupied with the formation of a rivière, or open-work hem round a cambric handkerchief.She said nothing, and her face and forehead, clothed with a mask of purely negative expression, were as blank of comment as her lips.As neither surprise, pleasure, approbation, nor interest was evinced in her countenance, so no more were disdain, envy, annoyance, weariness; if that inscrutable mien said anything, it was simply this,—"
"“这事太陈腐了，完全无法让人激动，也没什么意见好提的。”","‘The matter is too trite to excite an emotion or call forth an opinion.’"
"我一读完就响起一阵嗡嗡的议论声。几个学生围住了亨利小姐，七嘴八舌地恭维起来。这时传来了女校长漫不经心的声音：","As soon as I had done a hum rose,several of the pupils, pressing round Mdlle. Henri, began to beset her with compliments.The composed voice of the directress was now heard,—"
"“年轻的小姐们，你们中有斗篷和雨伞的就在雨下大之前快点回家吧”（当时正在下着小雨）；“其余的就等你们各自的仆人来接你们吧。”然后学校放学了，因为已经四点了。","‘Young ladies, such of you as have cloaks and umbrellas will hasten to return home before the shower becomes heavier’ (it was raining a little); ‘the remainder will wait till their respective servants arrive to fetch them.’ And the school dispersed, for it was four o’clock."
"“先生，有句话想跟你说，”勒泰小姐说。她站上讲台，同时做了个手势暗示她希望我等一下，我立即领会了她的意思。","‘Monsieur, a word,’ said Mdlle. Reuter, stepping on to the estrade, and signifying, by a movement of the hand, that she wished me to relinquish, for an instant, the castor I had clutched."
"“小姐，我听候您的吩咐。”","‘Mademoiselle, I am at your service.’"
"“先生，在年轻人面前大张旗鼓地表扬某些特别努力的学生所取得的明显进步以激励他们勤奋学习，这确实是一个很好的方法；但是以今天为例，你难道没有想过亨利小姐几乎不能跟其他学生同日而语的吗？她比她们中的大多数人都要年长，又具有学习英语的特殊天分这一优势。另一方面，她的社会地位要比她们稍微低一些。在这些情况下，于众人面前给亨利小姐这种殊荣，也许会引起比较之风，并且可能激起一些对她远为不利的情绪，使她成为众矢之的。我正是从亨利小姐本身的利益出发，才想要让她远离这种烦恼的；此外，先生，我之前已向您暗示过，她强烈的自尊感在她的性格里占主导地位。而名声很容易滋生这种感情；对她来说，这种感情还是该受到压抑——她确实应该克制而不是一味出头；而且我想，先生——我认为野心，尤其是在文学方面的野心，在一个女人的心灵中可不是什么该珍视的情感。教导亨利女士，让她相信她真正的才能在于默默地履行她的社会职责，而不是鼓励她追求掌声和公众的注意，这样她不是会更安全更幸福吗？她可能永不结婚；她经济来源匮乏，缺乏社会关系，身体也不好（因为我认为她是肺结核，她的母亲就是死于那种病），也许她根本就没想结婚。至少我是看不出她有结婚的可能；但是即使是独身，保持一位受人尊敬的端庄女性的性格和习惯对她来说也是较好的。”","‘Monsieur, it is, of course, an excellent plan to encourage effort in young people by making conspicuous the progress of any particularly industrious pupil; but do you not think that, in the present instance, Mdlle. Henri can hardly be considered as a concurrent with the other pupils?She is older than most of them, and has had advantages of an exclusive nature for acquiring a knowledge of English.On the other hand, her sphere of life is somewhat beneath theirs.Under these circumstances, a public distinction conferred upon Mdlle. Henri may be the means of suggesting comparisons and exciting feelings such as would be far from advantageous to the individual forming their object.The interest I take in Mdlle. Henri’s real welfare makes me desirous of screening her from annoyances of this sort; besides, monsieur, as I have before hinted to you, the sentiment of amour propre has a somewhat marked preponderance in her character.Celebrity has a tendency to foster this sentiment, and in her it should be rather repressed—she rather needs keeping down than bringing forward; and then I think, monsieur—it appears to me that ambition, literary ambition especially, is not a feeling to be cherished in the mind of a woman.Would not Mdlle. Henri be much safer and happier if taught to believe that in the quiet discharge of social duties consists her real vocation, than if stimulated to aspire after applause and publicity?She may never marry; scanty as are her resources, obscure as are her connections, uncertain as is her health (for I think her consumptive; her mother died of that complaint), it is more than probable she never will.I do not see how she can rise to a position whence such a step would be possible; but even in celibacy it would be better for her to retain the character and habits of a respectable decorous female.’"
"“无可置疑，小姐，”我回答道，“您的观点当然是对的。”我怕她又要长篇大论起来，便假意诚恳地附和着，一边匆忙退了出去。","‘Indisputably, mademoiselle,’ was my answer.‘Your opinion admits of no doubt;’ and fearful of the harangue being renewed, I retreated under cover of that cordial sentence of assent."
"就在上述这件小事发生两周后的一天，我从我的教学日记里发现亨利小姐有段时间没像往常一样来正常上课。","At the date of a fortnight after the little incident noted above, I find it recorded in my diary that a hiatus occurred in Mdlle. Henri’s usually regular attendance in class."
"开始一两天我为她的缺席感到纳闷，但是不想去问原因。事实上，我想从别人的闲聊中得到我想要的信息，省得去问而招来傻笑和闲言闲语。但是一个星期过去了，门旁边的桌子边上的位子仍然是空的，班上也没有人问及这件事——相反，我发现所有人都对此事有意避而不谈——因此，我决心放弃自己愚蠢的坚持，打破这沉默的坚冰。我选择了去问西尔维，因为我知道从她那里我至少可以得到一个明确的答案，而不是搪塞、窃笑之类的打马虎眼。","The first day or two I wondered at her absence, but did not like to ask an explanation of it. I thought, indeed, some chance word might be dropped which would afford me the information I wished to obtain, without my running the risk of exciting silly smiles and gossiping whispers by demanding it. But when a week passed and the seat at the desk near the door still remained vacant, and when no allusion was made to the circumstance by any individual of the class—when, on the contrary, I found that all observed a marked silence on the point—I determined, coûte qu’il coûte, to break the ice of this silly reserve.I selected Sylvie as my informant, because from her I knew that I should at least get a sensible answer, unaccompanied by wriggle, titter, or other flourish of folly."
"“亨利小姐到哪儿去了？”一天我趁着返还给她批过的作业的机会问她。","‘Où donc est Mdlle. Henri?’ I said one day as I returned an exercise-book I had been examining."
"“她走了，先生。”","‘Elle est partie, monsieur.’"
"“走了！要走多久呀？什么时候回来呢？”","‘Partie!et pour combien de temps?Quand reviendra-t-elle?’"
"“她永远地离开了，先生，她再也不会回来了。”","‘Elle est partie pour toujours, monsieur; elle ne reviendra plus.’"
"“啊！”我情不自禁地叫道，然后停了一会又问，","‘Ah!’ was my involuntary exclamation; then after a pause,—"
"“你肯定吗，西尔维？”","‘En êtes-vous bien sure, Sylvie?’"
"“没错的，没错的，先生，校长前两天亲口对我们说的。”","‘Oui, oui, monsieur, mademoiselle la directrice nous l’ a dit elle- même il y a deux ou trois jours’"
"我不能再问下去了；时间、地点以及环境都不允许我再多说一个字。我既不能对她所说的加以评价，也不能再进一步询问细节。我还想问问关于她离开的原因，是出于自愿还是其他原因，这些问题确实都到嘴边了，但我还是咽了下去——四周到处都有人在听着。一小时之后，碰见西尔维在走廊上戴帽子，我停了一下，问道：","And I could pursue my inquiries no further; time, place, and circumstances forbade my adding another word.I could neither comment on what had been said nor demand further particulars.A question as to the reason of the teacher’s departure, as to whether it had been voluntary or otherwise, was indeed on my lips, but I suppressed it—there were listeners all round.An hour after, in passing Sylvie in the corridor as she was putting on her bonnet, I stopped short and asked,—"
"“西尔维，你知道亨利小姐住在哪儿吗？我这里还有她的几本书，”我随意地加了一句，“我想把它们还给她。”","’Sylvie, do you know Mdlle. Henri’s address?I have some books of hers, ‘I added carelessly,’ and I should wish to send them to her.’"
"“我不知道，先生，”西尔维回答道，“但是也许门房罗莎莉能告诉你。”","‘No, monsieur,’ replied Sylvie; ‘but perhaps Rosalie, the portress, will be able to give it you.’"
"罗莎莉的房间就在附近。我走进门，又问了一遍。罗莎莉是个精明的法国女工，她放下手中的活，抬头看了看我，会心一笑——正是我一直避免引起的那种微笑。她的回答是精心准备好的。她说她对亨利小姐的地址一无所知——从来也没有听说过。我不耐烦地转过身——因为我相信她在撒谎，而且是被收买而撒谎——差点撞倒一个一直站在我身后的人。那个人正是女校长。我突然的转身动作使她后退了两三步。我只好道歉；我的道歉与其说彬彬有礼，不如说是在敷衍搪塞。没有人喜欢被监视，而且我当时在气头上，看见勒泰小姐，更是觉得恼羞成怒。我转过身，只见她面容僵硬，脸色阴沉，还有几分打探之意；她的眼睛带着一种近乎渴望的好奇神情盯着我，我几乎还没有捕捉到那个神情，它便消失了；此时她又堆出一副笑盈盈的面孔，一派温和地接受了我不甚由衷的道歉。","Rosalie’s cabinet was just at hand.I stepped in and repeated the inquiry.Rosalie, a smart French grisette, looked up from her work with a knowing smile, precisely the sort of smile I had been so desirous to avoid exciting.Her answer was prepared.She knew nothing whatever of Mdlle. Henri’s address—had never known it.Turning from her with impatience—for I believed she lied and was hired to lie—I almost knocked down some one who had been standing at my back.It was the directress.My abrupt movement made her recoil two or three steps.I was obliged to apologize, which I did more concisely than politely.No man likes to be dogged, and in the very irritable mood in which I then was the sight of Mdlle. Reuter thoroughly incensed me.At the moment I turned her countenance looked hard, dark, and inquisitive; her eyes were bent upon me with an expression of almost hungry curiosity.I had scarcely caught this phase of physiognomy ere it had vanished; a bland smile played on her features; my harsh apology was received with good-humoured facility."
"“哦，没关系，先生，你的手肘只碰到了我的头发，不要紧，只是把头发弄得有点乱。”她向后甩了甩头发，又用手指卷了卷，放开后又显出更多流畅的波纹。接着她又故作轻松地说，——","‘Oh, don’t mention it, monsieur; you only touched my hair with your elbow; it is no worse, only a little dishevelled.’ She shook it back, and passing her fingers through her curls, loosened them into more numerous and flowing ringlets.Then she went on with vivacity,—"
"“罗莎莉，我是来告诉你，赶快去把客厅的窗子关上。刮风了，平纹布窗帘上会沾到灰尘的。”","‘Rosalie, I was coming to tell you to go instantly and close the windows of the salon.The wind is rising, and the muslin curtains will be covered with dust.’"
"罗莎莉离开了。“这可不行”我想。勒泰小姐以为找个借口就可以将她偷听别人说话的卑劣行径掩盖过去，更何况，让平纹布窗帘这借口也假得太过分了。我突然有一种冲动，想戳穿这低劣的谎言，大胆地说几句实话来对抗她的伎俩。“在滑地上行走，穿着带防滑钉铁蹄的鞋最稳当。”我想，于是我开始说：“亨利小姐已经离开了您的学校。我想她是被开除的吧？”“啊，我想跟你谈一谈，先生，”女校长用世界上最为自然友善的声音回答道，“但是在这里无法安静地交谈。请先生到公园去一会儿好吗？”于是她便在我前面，走出了我之前提到的那个玻璃门。","Rosalie departed.‘Now,’ thought I, ‘this will not do. Mdlle. Reuter thinks her meanness in eavesdropping is screened by her art in devising a pretext, whereas the muslin curtains she speaks of are not more transparent than this same pretext.’ An impulse came over me to thrust the flimsy screen aside, and confront her craft boldly with a word or two of plain truth.‘The roughshod foot treads most firmly on slippery ground,’ thought I; so I began,—‘Mademoiselle Henri has left your establishment, been dismissed, I presume?’‘Ah, I wished to have a little conversation with you, monsieur,’ replied the directress, with the most natural and affable air in the world.‘but we cannot talk quietly here.Will monsieur step into the garden a minute?’ And she preceded me, stepping out through the glass door I have before mentioned."
"“就这儿吧。”当我们走到那条小路的正中时，她说道。时值仲夏，园中树木枝叶茂盛，所过之处都被灌木丛包围着，使我们看不见任何房屋，因此尽管这一块小地方处于城市的中心地带，但仍给人一种世外桃源的感觉。“在这里，一个人置身于梨树与玫瑰花丛之中，会感到静谧与自由。我敢说，先生您跟我一样，有时也会厌倦无休止地处于生活之中，厌倦于一张张总是在你周围的面孔，一双双总是盯着你的眼睛，一阵阵充斥你耳朵的人声。我总是很希望能有空到乡下的某个小农舍里无拘无束地住上一个月，环境优美，空气清新，周围都是原野或树林，那种田园生活多么地美妙啊！不是吗，先生？”","‘There,’ said she, when we had reached the centre of the middle alley, and when the foliage of shrubs and trees, now in their summer pride, closing behind and around us, shut out the view of the house, and thus imparted a sense of seclusion even to this little plot of ground in the very core of a capital—‘there one feels quiet and free when there are only pear-trees and rose-bushes about one.I dare say you, like me, monsieur, are sometimes tired of being eternally in the midst of life, of having human faces always round you, human eyes always upon you, human voices always in your ear. I am sure I often wish intensely for liberty to spend a whole month in the country at some little farmhouse, bien gentille, bien propre tout entouree de champs et de bois; quelle vie charmante que la vie champetre!N’est-ce pas, monsieur?’"
"“那得看情况，小姐。”","‘Cela depend, mademoiselle.’"
"“好凉爽的风啊！”女校长继续说道，这回她倒说得没错，因为确实一阵柔和的南风拂过，沁人心脾。我把帽子拿在手里，这阵微风掠过我的头发，如同手掌一样轻抚着我的两鬓。然而这清爽的感觉只限于身体表面，因为当我和勒泰小姐并肩而行时，我的心中仍是愤愤不平，当我在深思的时候那把怒火仍在熊熊燃烧。然后我硬着舌头说：","‘Que le vent est bon et frais!’ continued the directress; and she was right there, for it was a south wind, soft and sweet.I carried my hat in my hand, and this gentle breeze, passing through my hair, soothed my temples like palm.Its refreshing effect, however, penetrated no deeper than the mere surface of the frame; for as I walked by the side of Mdlle. Reuter my heart was still hot within me, and while I was musing the fire burned.Then spoke I with my tongue,—"
"“我知道亨利小姐已经走了，而且不会回来了，是吧？”","‘I understand Mdlle. Henri is gone from hence, and will not return?’"
"“啊，是这样！我本准备几天前跟您说这件事的，但是我的时间总是被占得满满的，我想做的事一半都没做到。事情太多，总是觉得白天十二个小时不够用，先生，您有过这样的经历吗？”","‘Ah, true!I meant to have named the subject to you some days ago, but my time is so completely taken up I cannot do half the things I wish.Have you never experienced what it is, monsieur, to find the day too short by twelve hours for your numerous duties?’"
"“不常有。我想，亨利小姐的离开并不是自愿的吧？如果是自愿的话，作为我的学生她应该会知会我一声的。”","‘Not often.Mdlle. Henri’s departure was not voluntary, I presume?If it had been, she would certainly have given me some intimation of it, being my pupil.’"
"“哦，她没告诉你吗？那是有些奇怪了。至于我，我从来没想起来要讲这件事。当人有太多事情忙的时候，很容易忘记一些无关痛痒的小事。”","‘Oh, she did not tell you?That was strange.For my part, I never thought of adverting to the subject; when one has so many things to attend to, one is apt to forget little incidents that are not of primary importance.’"
"“您认为亨利小姐被解雇是一件鸡毛蒜皮的小事？”","‘You consider Mdlle. Henri’s dismission, then, as a very insignificant event?’"
"“被解雇？啊！她不是被解雇的，我可以实话实说，先生，自从我担任这所学校的校长以来还没有哪个老师被解雇过。”","‘Dismission?Ah! she was not dismissed, I can say with truth, monsieur, that since I became the head of this establishment no master or teacher has ever been dismissed from it.’"
"“但是有些人不是离开了吗，小姐？”","‘Yet some have left it, mademoiselle?’"
"“是很多人。我觉得时不时的变化是很有必要的。更换一下老师对于维护一所学校的利益是大有好处的，它可以使得各项讨论更多元，更具活力，使得学生有新鲜感，同时让家长感到这所学校在不断改善进步。”","‘Many.I have found it necessary to change frequently.A change of instructors is often beneficial to the interests of a school; it gives life and variety to the proceedings; it amuses the pupils, and suggests to the parents the idea of exertion and progress.’"
"“那么当您对某个教师感到厌烦并解聘他们的时候会有顾虑吗？”","‘Yet when you are tired of a professor or maitresse you scruple to dismiss them?’"
"“完全没有必要采取这样极端的方式，这我可以向你保证。来，先生，我们坐着说吧，我想就您的教师身份给您一点小小的忠告。”（我希望能把她用法语对我所说的话都写下来；翻译成英语会面目全非的。）此时我们走到了花园长椅处。女校长坐了下来，示意让我坐到她旁边；但我只是一条腿搭在椅子上，另一条腿站着，头和胳膊靠在一棵巨大的金链花枝干上，上面长满了树叶；它金色的花朵与紫丁香暗绿的叶子彼此交错，在这幽静的角落构成一个光影婆娑的弧形顶盖。勒泰小姐默不作声地坐了一会；很明显，她脑袋里正在打着新算盘，这一点可以从她狡猾的眉毛上看出来。她在苦想着什么锦囊妙计。几个月的经验使我确信，她本不具有却硬要装出来的美德对我是没有用了——因为我已经看穿了她的本性，不会再相信她做出的任何姿态——最后她下定决心要用一把新钥匙，来试试看能不能打开我的心灵之锁，那就是一点厚颜无耻，一句真话和一段真相。“好吧，我试试看，”这是她内心的决定；接着，她那蓝眼睛朝我闪动起来——那里并没有闪现什么，在那有节制的一瞥中并没有任何点燃的激情。","‘No need to have recourse to such extreme measures I assure you. Allons, monsieur le professeur—asseyons nous; je vais vous donner une petite lecon dans votre etat d’instituteur.’ (I wish I might write all she said to me in French; it loses sadly by being translated into English.)We had now reached the garden-chair.The directress sat down, and signed to me to sit by her; but I only rested my knee on the seat, and stood leaning my head and arm against the embowering branch of a huge laburnum, whose golden flowers, blent with the dusky green leaves of a lilac-bush, formed a mixed arch of shade and sunshine over the retreat.Mdlle. Reuter sat silent a moment; some novel movements were evidently working in her mind, and they showed their nature on her astute brow.She was meditating some chef d’ouvre of policy.Convinced by several months’ experience that the affectation of virtues she did not possess was unavailing to ensnare me—aware that I had read her real nature, and would believe nothing of the character she gave out as being hers—she had determined at last to try a new key, and see if the lock of my heart would yield to that; a little audacity, a word of truth a glimpse of the real.’Yes, I will try,’ was her inward resolve; and then her blue eye glittered upon me—it did not flash, nothing of flame ever kindled in its temperate gleam."
"“先生莫非不敢坐在我旁边？”她调侃似地问。","‘Monsieur fears to sit by me?’ she inquired playfully."
"“我并不想侵占珀莱的位置，”我回答道，我已经养成跟她直言不讳的习惯——一开始这样是因为愤怒，但是之所以我继续这样做，是因为我发现这非但没有使她生气，反而让她着迷。她收起目光，垂下眼帘。她心神不安地叹了口气，焦虑地转过身去，似乎想让我感觉正有一只小鸟在笼子里振翅，想冲出笼子，飞离主人，寻觅它自然的同伴和欢乐的鸟巢。","‘I have no wish to usurp Pelet’s place,’ I answered, for I had got the habit of speaking to her bluntly—a habit begun in anger, but continued because I saw that, instead of offending it fascinated her.She cast down her eyes and dropped her eyelids.She sighed uneasily; she turned with an anxious gesture, as if she would give me the idea of a bird that flutters in its cage, and would fain fly from its jail and jailer, and seek its natural mate and pleasant nest."
"“好吧，那您的忠告呢？”我简短地问道。","‘Well, and your lesson?’ I demanded briefly."
"“啊！”她一下子回过神来，惊叫道，”您这么年轻，这么坦率，勇敢无惧，又这么有天分，看不上愚钝，又瞧不上庸俗，您确实需要一些忠告。我想跟您说的是，在这个世界上需要靠巧力来解决的事比需要靠蛮力解决的事要多得多；但是也许您以前就知道了，因为您的性格粗中有细，既有谋才又不失傲骨！”","‘Ah!’ she exclaimed, recovering herself, ‘you are so young, so frank and fearless, so talented, so impatient of imbecility, so disdainful of vulgarity, you need a lesson.Here it is, then.Far more is to be done in this world by dexterity than by strength; but perhaps you knew that before, for there is delicacy as well as power in your character, policy as well as pride!’"
"“说下去，”我说道，并情不自禁地笑了起来，这一番奉承听起来十分痛快，也恰如其分。尽管我用手去掩住那强忍的笑，她还是看到了；她再次腾出空间让我坐在她身边。我摇了摇头，尽管那种诱惑此时已经冲破了我的理性，我再一次让她继续说下去。","‘Go on,’ said I; and I could hardly help smiling, the flattery was so piquant, so finely seasoned.She caught the prohibited smile, though I passed my hand over my mouth to conceal it: and again she made room for me to sit beside her.I shook my head, though temptation penetrated to my senses at the moment, and once more I told her to go on."
"“好吧，倘若有朝一日您成为一所大学校的校长，请不要解雇任何人。说真话，先生（对您我要说真话），我鄙视那些总是吵吵嚷嚷，说话气势汹汹，今天解雇这个，明天辞退那个，不分青红皂白胡乱处理事情的人。让我告诉您我最喜欢什么，好吗先生？”她又抬起头看着我，这次她给的眼神搭配得很好——十分顽皮，也更为顺从，外加少许故作媚态的风骚，还有毫不掩饰的自负。我点了点头。她像对待莫卧儿大帝一样对待我；我估计在她眼里我就是莫卧儿大帝了。","‘Well, then, if ever you are at the head of a large establishment, dismiss nobody.To speak truth, monsieur (and to you I will speak truth), I despise people who are always making rows, blustering, sending off one to the right, and another to the left, urging and hurrying circumstances.I’ll tell you what I like best to do, monsieur, shall I?’ She looked up again; she had compounded her glance well this time—much archness, more deference, a spicy dash of coquetry, an unveiled consciousness of capacity.I nodded.She treated me like the great Mogul; so I became the great Mogul as far as she was concerned."
"“先生，我喜欢手里拿着我的编织物，安静地坐在我的椅子上。各种事务列队一般从我身边经过。我看着它们前进。只要它们按着我所希望的路线行走，我就什么都不说什么也不做。我不会边鼓掌边说‘太棒了！我多幸运呐！’以此来吸引邻居们的关注与羡慕——我只会不动声色；可是当有事情脱轨——当情况不利时——我就会高度警惕地查看着。我还是会静静地编织，还是不说话，但是先生，我只需要伸出脚——就是这样——私下里悄悄地踹那个反叛者一脚，把他送回到我所希望的轨道上；而我终究是成功了，也没有人看到我的对策。所以，每当有老师变得调皮捣蛋并且效率低下——简而言之，当他们留在学校便会损坏学校的利益时——我专心织着我的衣服；事情发展，情况倒退；如果我发现有人不管怎样都推不上正轨，无法完成我交给他的工作时——我就会采取行动——绊脚石被搬开了——没有人看见我，我也没有树敌，只是解决掉了一个累赘。”","‘I like, monsieur, to take my knitting in my hands, and to sit quietly down in my chair.Circumstances defile past me.I watch their march.So long as they follow the course I wish, I say nothing and do nothing.I don’t clap my hands, and cry out “Bravo!how lucky I am!” to attract the attention and envy of my neighbours—I am merely passive; but when events fall out ill—when circumstances become adverse—I watch very vigilantly.I knit on still, and still I hold my tongue; but every now and then, monsieur, I just put my toe out—so—and give the rebellious circumstance a little secret push, without noise which sends it the way I wish, and I am successful after all, and nobody has seen my expedient.So, when teachers or masters become troublesome and inefficient—when, in short, the interests of the school would suffer from their retaining their places—I mind my knitting; events progress, circumstances glide past; I see one which, if pushed ever so little awry will render untenable the post I wish to have vacated—the deed is done—the stumbling- block removed—and no one saw me; I have not made an enemy; I am rid of an encumbrance.’"
"之前我以为她在引诱我，而当她说完时，我憎恶地看着她。“多么像你。”我冷冷地答道。“你就是用这种方法赶走亨利小姐的？你想解除她的职务，所以你便使她在这待不下去？”","A moment since, and I thought her alluring; this speech concluded, I looked on her with distaste.‘Just like you,’ was my cold answer.‘And in this way you have ousted Mdlle. Henri? You wanted her office, therefore you rendered it intolerable to her?’"
"“完全不是这样的，先生；我只是关心亨利小姐的健康。不，您一向明辨是非，但是这一次您没看清事实。我曾——我一直是真真正正地在为亨利小姐着想。我不想看到她不管刮风下雨都得外出，我想如果她能找到一个固定的职位对她会更有益；此外，我觉得现在她有能力做更多的事，不用非得教缝纫。我对她晓之以理，让她自己做决定。她知道我的观点是对的，于是便接受了。”","‘Not at all, monsieur; I was merely anxious about Mdlle. Henri’s health.No; your moral sight is clear and piercing, but there you have failed to discover the truth.I took—I have always taken a real interest in Mdlle. Henri’s welfare.I did not like her going out in all weathers; I thought it would be more advantageous for her to obtain a permanent situation: besides, I considered her now qualified to do something more than teach sewing.I reasoned with her; left the decision to herself She saw the correctness of my views, and adopted them.’"
"“太棒了！那现在，小姐，请您把她的地址给我吧。“","‘Excellent!And now, mademoiselle, you will have the goodness to give me her address.’"
"“她的地址！”女校长的态度立即变得阴暗而冷酷——“她的地址？啊！好吧，我倒是很愿意告诉您，先生，但是我不能，我来告诉您原因。因为我自己每次问她住在哪儿时，她总是避而不谈。我觉得——当然我有可能是错的——我觉得她这么做虽然不对，但她的动机也合乎情理，她极有可能是不想让我看见她十分贫寒的住所。她收入不多，出身卑微，毋庸置疑，她一定是住在一个‘下层的居住区'。”","‘Her address!’ and a sombre and stony change came over the mien of the directress—‘her address?Ah! well, I wish I could oblige you, monsieur, but I cannot, and I will tell you why. Whenever I myself asked her for her address, she always evaded the inquiry.I thought—I may be wrong—but I thought her motive for doing so was a natural though mistaken reluctance to introduce me to some probably very poor abode.Her means were narrow, her origin obscure; she lives somewhere, doubtless, in the ‘basse ville.’’"
"“我不会见不到我最好的学生的，”我说道，“即便她是出身于乞丐家庭，住在地下室里；另外，关于她的出身您欺骗我可太可笑了。我碰巧知道她刚好是一位瑞士牧师的女儿，至于她的贫寒，只要她拥有丰富的精神世界，再穷我也不在乎。”","‘I’ll not lose sight of my best pupil yet,’ said I, ‘though she were born of beggars and lodged in a cellar; for the rest, it is absurd to make a bugbear of her origin to me. I happen to know that she was a Swiss pastor’s daughter, neither more nor less; and as to her narrow means, I care nothing for the poverty of her purse so long as her heart overflows with affluence.’"
"“先生，您的情操真是无比高尚。”女校长说道，并假装要打哈欠但又忍住的样子；如今她的活泼已经荡然无存，她片刻的直率已经无处可见。那面狭小的厚颜无耻的红色海盗三角旗在空中飘扬了一阵后被收起来了，取而代之的是虚伪欺骗的素色大旗，它再次低低地挂在城堡之上。我不喜欢她这样子，于是我中断了谈话，起身离去。","‘Your sentiments are perfectly noble, monsieur,’ said the directress, affecting to suppress a yawn; her sprightliness was now extinct, her temporary candour shut up. The little, red-coloured, piratical-looking pennon of audacity she had allowed to float a minute in the air was furled, and the broad, sober-hued flag of dissimulation again hung low over the citadel.I did not like her thus, so I cut short the tete-a-tete and departed."
"第十九章","CHAPTER XIX"
"小说家们绝不应该让自己对现实生活的研究感到厌烦。如果他们认真履行了这种职责，就不会向我们呈现出那么多光明与明暗交织，对比如此鲜明的画面了。他们很少让男女主人公提升到狂喜的状态，更不会让他们陷入绝望的境地，因为如果我们很少体会到生活中充满欢乐，那就更难品尝到绝望痛苦的辛酸。的确，除非我们像野兽一样沉浸于声色犬马——肆意挥霍，强弩精神，深受刺激，过度劳累，最终毁掉了我们享乐的能力；那时我们会发现自己真的失去了支撑，丧失了希望。我们的痛苦是巨大的，然而它会怎样结束呢？我们破坏了力量的源泉。活着就是要受尽折磨——生命太虚弱而难以产生信念；死亡就是一片黑暗；上帝、精神和宗教在我们垮掉的心灵上没有立足之地，那上面只有对罪恶那丑恶肮脏的回忆；时间把我们带到坟墓的边缘，腐尸将我们裹挟进去——如同一块破布，被疾病反复咀嚼，被痛苦一次次折磨，而后被无情的绝望之蹄践踏，踩烂到教堂庭院的草皮之中。","Novelists should never allow themselves to weary of the study of real life.If they observed this duty conscientiously, they would give us fewer pictures chequered with vivid contrasts of light and shade；they would seldom elevate their heroes and heroines to the heights of rapture, still seldomer sink them to the depths of despair; for if we rarely taste the fullness of joy in this life, we yet more rarely savour the acrid bitterness of hopeless anguish.Unless, indeed, we have plunged like beasts into sensual indulgence—abused, strained, stimulated, again overstrained, and at last destroyed our faculties for enjoyment; then, truly, we may find ourselves without support, robed of hope.Our agony is great, and how can it end?We have broken the spring of our powers.Life must be all suffering—too feeble to conceive faith; death must be darkness; God, spirits, religion can have no place in our collapsed minds, where linger only hideous and polluting recollections of vice; and time brings us on to the brink of the grave, and dissolution flings us in—a rag eaten through and through with disease, wrung together with pain, stamped into the churchyard sod by the inexorable heel of despair."
"但是，生活有规律而且头脑清醒的人永远不会绝望。他失去了他的财产——这是当头一棒——他蹒跚了一会儿，然后那被痛苦所激起的能量便开始寻找拯救的方案；行动会立即减轻懊悔。疾病折磨他，他却耐心忍受着那无法治愈的疾病。剧烈的疼痛撕扯着他——扭曲的四肢不知该倚靠何处，他只能依偎在希望的铁锚上。死亡夺走了他的所爱；连根拔起并且残暴地撕裂了他情感与之共生的树干——那是一个黑暗阴沉的时刻，一种可怕的痛苦。但是一天清晨，信仰伴着朝霞探望了他荒凉的房子，说道，在另一个世界，另一个生命，他会与族亲重逢。信仰谈到那个世界是一个不曾被罪恶玷污的地方，那段生命不会受痛苦的折磨；她通过联系两种思想——两种凡人不能理解，但愿意依靠的思想——永恒与不朽极大地增强了她的安抚之意；哀悼者的内心被充满光明与安宁的天国山峦之景填满了，这景色模糊但却壮丽——一个受福佑的灵魂在那里安享——某一天他的灵魂也会升入那里，自由自在，没有羁绊——没有恐惧，只有爱的圆满的团聚——他走出去挺身面对必经的困难和生命的责任；虽然永远无法将悲伤的负担从心灵上卸下，但希望已经赋予他了承受的力量。","But the man of regular life and rational mind never despairs.He loses his property—it is a blow—he staggers a moment; then his energies, roused by the smart, are at work to seek a remedy; activity soon mitigates regret.Sickness affects him; he takes patience—endures what he cannot cure.Acute pain racks him—his writhing limbs know not where to find rest; he leans on Hope’s anchor.Death takes from him what he loves; roots up, and tears violently away the stem round which his affections were twined—a dark, dismal time, a frightful wrench.But some morning Religion looks into his desolate house with sunrise, and says that in another world, another life, he shall meet his kindred again.She speaks of that world as a place unsullied by sin, of that life as an era unembittered by suffering; she mightily strengthens her consolation by connecting with it two ideas—which mortals cannot comprehend, but on which they love to repose—Eternity, Immortality; and the mind of the mourner, being filled with an image, faint yet glorious, of heavenly hills all light and peace—of a spirit resting there in bliss—of a day when his spirit shall also alight there, free and disembodied—of a reunion perfected by love, purified from fear—goes out to encounter then necessities and discharges the duties of life; and, though sadness may never lift her burden from his mind, Hope will enable him to support it."
"那么，所有这些意味着什么，从中又该得到什么结论呢？这些意味着，我最好的学生——我的珍宝——被从我的手中夺去，并被抛到了我无从寻找的地方。从中可以得到的结论是，作为一个沉着稳重、通情达理的人，我既不能让怨恨、失望和悲伤趁虚而入，在我的心里扎根长成参天大树，也不能让它们霸占我的整个心灵；相反，我要将它们囚禁在一个狭窄而隐秘的角落里。白天工作时，我让它们沉默安静；只有到夜晚关上自己的房门后，我才稍稍放松对这些忧郁婴儿的严格管教，允许它们窃窃私语地发泄；于是，为了报复我，它们就坐在我的枕上，缠在我的床边，用幽长的夜半哭声吵得我无法入眠。","Well, and what suggested all this, and what is the inference to be drawn therefrom?What suggested it is the circumstance of my best pupil—my treasure—being snatched from my hands, and put away out of my reach.The inference to be drawn from it is, that being a steady, reasonable man, I did not allow the resentment, disappointment, and grief engendered in my mind by this evil chance to grow there to any monstrous size, nor did I allow them to monopolize the whole space of my heart; I pent them, on the contrary, in one strait and secret nook.In the daytime, too, when I was about my duties, I put them on the silent system; and it was only after I had closed the door of my chamber at night that I somewhat relaxed my severity towards these morose nurslings, and allowed vent to their language of murmurs; then, in revenge, they sat on my pillow, haunted my bed, and kept me awake with their long midnight cry."
"一个星期过去了。我没有跟勒泰小姐说过一句话。尽管我对她没什么过激的举动，但态度冷酷无情，而且生硬。“小姐，您能否发发慈悲将弗朗西斯·埃文斯·亨利的住址给我？”","A week passed.I had said nothing more to Mdlle. Reuter. I had been calm in my demeanour to her, though stony cold and hard.‘Mademoiselle, will you have the goodness to give me the address of Frances Evans Henri?’"
"她有些吃惊，但并没有慌乱，她微笑着说自己并不知道那个地址，还补充道：“先生难道忘了，关于这件事情我之前已经向您解释过了——就在一个星期之前？”","A little surprised, but not disconcerted, she smilingly disclaimed any knowledge of that address, adding, ‘Monsieur has perhaps forgotten that I explained all about that circumstance before—a week ago?’"
"“小姐，”我接着说道，“如果您能告知我那个年轻人的住处，我将不胜感激。”","‘Mademoiselle,’ I continued, ‘you would greatly oblige me by directing me to that young person’s abode.’"
"她似乎有点迷惑，但是最终以伪装得十分完美的天真表情问道：“难道先生认为我在说谎吗？”","She seemed somewhat puzzled; and at last, looking up with an admirably counterfeited air of naivete, she demanded ‘Does monsieur think I am telling an untruth?’"
"我还是避免正面回答她的问题，说道：“小姐，您的意思是您并不打算在这件事上帮我这个忙了？”","Still avoiding to give her a direct answer, I said, ‘It is not, then, your intention, mademoiselle, to oblige me in this particular?’"
"“但是，先生，我怎么能告诉您我不知道的事情呢？”","‘But, monsieur, how can I tell you what I do not know?’"
"“非常好。我完全明白您的意思，小姐，现在我只想说两三句话。这是七月的最后一个星期，下个月假期就要开始了。劳烦您最好利用假期时间再找一位英语老师。在八月底我将不得已辞去在贵校的职位。”","‘Very well.I understand you perfectly, mademoiselle, and now I have only two or three words to say.This is the last week in July; in another month the vacation will commence.Have the goodness to avail yourself of the leisure it will afford you to look out for another English master.At the close of August I shall be under the necessity of resigning my post in your establishment.’"
"我没有等她对我的话发表评论便鞠了个躬，立即离开了。","I did not wait for her comments on this announcement, but bowed and immediately withdrew."
"当天晚上晚饭过后不久，一位仆人给了我一个小包裹。我很熟悉上面的笔迹，但是没想到这么快又见到它。独处在自己的公寓时，我迫不及待地打开了它。那里面有四枚五法郎的硬币和一张用英文写的便条。","That same evening, soon after dinner, a servant brought me a small packet.It was directed in a hand I knew, but had not hoped so soon to see again.Being in my own apartment and alone, there was nothing to prevent my immediately opening it. It contained four five-franc pieces, and a note in English."
"“先生，我昨天去了勒泰小姐房间，我知道当时您快要下课了，所以我就问我能否到教室跟您说几句话。勒泰小姐出来说您已经走了。那时还没到四点，所以我想她肯定弄错了，但是我想就同一件事改天再来拜访一次也徒劳无益。从某种意义上说留一张便条也是一样的。里面有二十法郎，是我上您的课应缴的费用；如果它不足以表达我对您的感谢，我会日后再补上——如果它不能如我所愿地向您告别——如果它不能如我长期所盼望的那样表达我可能再也见不到您的遗憾之情——那么，当面谈也无法充分表达我的心意。如果能见到您，或许我也只是结结巴巴地说一些软弱无力，无法令人满意的话——那些话只会掩饰我的情感，而不是解释它们；所以，也许我没能见到您倒也好。先生，您经常说，我的习作总是围绕着隐忍伤痛的坚韧来写，您说这个主题我写得太多了。我发现事实上去描写一种严苛的职责要比去经历它容易得多，因为每当我明白并感受到颠倒的命运对我的谴责时，我就感到十分压抑。先生，您对我很好——非常好。我很痛苦——与您分别令我极度伤心，不久我在这世上就彻底没有朋友了。但是为了我的痛苦去叨扰您是没有用的。我有什么权利要求您的同情呢？没有。我应就此罢笔。——再见，先生。","‘Monsieur,—I came to Mdlle. Reuter’s house yesterday at the time when I knew you would be just about finishing your lesson, and I asked if I might go into the schoolroom and speak to you.Mdlle. Reuter came out and said you were already gone.It had not yet struck four, so I thought she must be mistaken, but concluded it would be vain to call another day on the same errand.In one sense a note will do as well.It will wrap up the twenty francs, the price of the lessons I have received from you; and if it will not fully express the thanks I owe you in addition—if it will not bid you good-bye as I could wish to have done—if it will not tell you, as I long to do, how sorry I am that I shall probably never see you more—why, spoken words would hardly be more adequate to the task.Had I seen you, I should probably have stammered out something feeble and unsatisfactory—something belying my feelings rather than explaining them; so it is perhaps as well that I was denied admission to your presence.You often remarked, monsieur, that my devoirs dwelt a great deal on fortitude in bearing grief; you said I introduced that theme too often.I find indeed that it is much easier to write about a severe duty than to perform it, for I am oppressed when I see and feel to what a reverse fate has condemned me.You were kind to me, monsieur—very kind.I am afflicted—I am heart-broken to be quite separated from you; soon I shall have no friend on earth.But it is useless troubling you with my distresses.What claim have I on your sympathy?None. I will then say no more.—Farewell, monsieur."
"F．E．亨利。”","F. E. Henri."
"我将这张便条夹在我的小笔记本里，将这几枚五法郎硬币塞进钱包里，然后便在我狭小的房间里转起圈来。","I put up the note in my pocket-book; I slipped the five-franc pieces into my purse; then I took a turn through my narrow chamber."
"“勒泰小姐说过她的贫困，”我自言自语道，“她确实穷，但是她付了学费，而且还多付了。我还没有教够她一个季度的课程，她却给了我一个季度的报酬。我想知道她为了存够这二十法郎是怎么省吃俭用的。我想知道她住在什么样的地方，她的姑妈是个什么样的人，还想知道她是否能找到差事来替代所失去的这份工作。毋庸置疑，她不得不整日长途跋涉，从一所学校到另一所学校，这里问问那里找找，不是被这里拒绝就是对那里感到失望。很多个夜晚她会疲惫不堪，满心沮丧地爬上床。而校长甚至不肯让她来跟我道个别？我就不能有个机会跟她在教室的窗口前站上几分钟，说上几句话——弄清楚她住在哪里——搞清楚事情的来龙去脉，好让我心里也有个交待？便条上也没有地址。”想到这儿，我从小笔记本里又拿出它，把那两页纸翻来覆去看了又看。“女人终究还是女人，她们总是以女人的方式做事。男人写信都会顺手写上日期和地址。这几个硬币，”（我把它们从钱包里扒出来）——“如果她是亲手将它们交给我，而不是用绿丝带把它们扎在小人国似的袋子里，我就能够把钱塞回她的小手里，然后合上她那纤纤玉指——就这样——她的惭愧、骄傲、害羞，最后都不得不服从于我坚定的意志。她现在到底在哪儿？我怎么才能找到她？”","‘Mdlle. Reuter talked about her poverty,’ said I, ‘and she is poor; yet she pays her debts and more.I have not yet given her a quarter’s lessons, and she has sent me a quarter’s due. I wonder of what she deprived herself to scrape together the twenty francs.I wonder what sort of a place she has to live in, and what sort of a woman her aunt is, and whether she is likely to get employment to supply the place she has lost.No doubt she will have to trudge about long enough from school to school, to inquire here and apply there, she rejected in this place, disappointed in that.Many an evening she’ll go to her bed tired and unsuccessful.And the directress would not let her in to bid me good-bye?I might not have the chance of standing with her for a few minutes at a window in the schoolroom and exchanging some half-dozen of sentences—getting to know where she lived—putting matters in train for having all things arranged to my mind?No address on the note,’ I continued, drawing it again from the pocket-book and examining it on each side of the two leaves.‘Women are women that is certain, and always do business like women.Men mechanically put a date and address to their communications.And these five-franc pieces’ (I hauled them forth from my purse)—‘if she had offered me them herself instead of tying them up with a thread of green silk in a kind of Lilliputian packet, I could have thrust them back into her little hand, and shut up the small, taper fingers over them—so—and compelled her shame, her pride, her shyness, all to yield to a little bit of determined will.Now where is she?How can I get at her?’"
"我打开房间门，走到楼下的厨房。","Opening my chamber door, I walked down into the kitchen."
"“谁送这个包裹过来的？”我问那个递给我包裹的仆人。","‘Who brought the packet?’ I asked of the servant who had delivered it to me."
"“一个小信差，先生。”","‘Un petit commissionaire, monsieur.’"
"“他说什么了吗？”","‘Did he say anything?’"
"“没有。”","‘Rien.’"
"我便走回楼上，以便能好好思考这些事。","And I wended my way up the back stairs, wondrously the wiser for my inquiries."
"“没关系，”我再次关上房门自言自语道，“没关系，就算走遍布鲁塞尔我也要找到她。”","‘No matter,’ said I to myself, as I again closed the door—‘no matter; I’ll seek her through Brussels.’"
"我真的这样做了。只要我有一小会的空闲时间，我便去找她，日复一日，找了四个星期。每逢周日我便整日地找她；我到大路上找，到林阴小道上找，到公园找；我到圣居迪勒教堂和圣雅克教堂找；到两所基督教礼拜堂找；到那两个专供德国人、法国人和英国人做礼拜的基督教堂找，我会在其中一个教堂遇见她，对此我从未怀疑过。我的所有找寻都是徒劳无功；我确定我会在那两个礼拜堂见到她，但这想法和我其他的估计一样，被事实证明是没有根据的。每当礼拜结束时，我便站在两个礼拜堂的门口，直到每个人都出来，我认真地审视着每件长袍盖住的苗条身姿，窥视着每个圆帽遮盖下的年轻脑袋。还是白费力气。我看着一个个少女走过我的身边，将她们的黑色披肩拉下来盖住倾斜的双肩，但是没有一个人有亨利小姐那样的气质和风度。我看着一张张苍白而又深思的脸蛋，配着褐色头发；但是我从来没有见到亨利小姐那样的前额，那样的双眼，那样的眉毛。我所见的所有的面部特征似乎都渐渐消失，因为我的眼睛没能找到我想要看到的特质——宽阔的眉间，大眼睛黝黑而严肃，以及眼睛上那线条分明的精致眉毛。","And I did. I sought her day by day, whenever I had a moment’s leisure, for four weeks.I sought her on Sundays all day long; I sought her on the boulevards, in the Allée Verte, in the Park; I sought her in St. Gudule and St. Jacques; I sought her in the two Protestant chapels; I attended these latter at the German, French, and English services, not doubting that I should meet her at one of them.All my researches were absolutely fruitless; my security on the last point was proved by the event to be equally groundless with my other calculations.I stood at the door of each chapel after the service, and waited till every individual had come out scrutinizing every gown draping a slender form, peering under every bonnet covering a young head.In vain.I saw girlish figures pass me, drawing their black scarfs over their sloping shoulders, but none of them had the exact turn and air of Mdlle. Henri’s. I saw pale and thoughtful faces encadrees in bands of brown hair, but I never found her forehead, her eyes, her eye- brows.All the features of all the faces I met seemed frittered away, because my eye failed to recognize the peculiarities it was bent upon—an ample space of brow and a large dark, and serious eye, with a fine but decided line of eyebrow traced above."
"“很有可能她已经离开布鲁塞尔了——也许她去英国了，因为她说过她会去。”我心里自语道，在第四个周日的下午，我离开了皇家礼拜堂的大门，刚转过身，看门人就关门上锁，我跟在最后一批信徒后面。现在他们在广场上渐渐散开了。很快我就超过了那一对对英国男女们。（天啊！他们就不能穿得好看点吗？我满眼尽是用名贵绸缎做成的镶着多层荷叶边的邋遢衣服，尽是绣着昂贵花边的不得体的大领子，尽是裁剪糟糕的外套和形状古怪的裤子；每个周日英国人做礼拜时，皇家礼拜堂唱诗班都穿这种衣服，祈祷结束后，他们又涌入广场，与那些匆匆赶来参观科堡大教堂的外国人清新整洁的打扮形成鲜明对比，实在是有损英国人的形象。）我超过了这一对对英国人，超过了一群群可爱的英国小孩，超过了一个个英国的男侍从和女仆人；我穿过了皇室住宅区，来到了国王大街，从那里拐进了卢汶街，一条古老寂静的街道。我感到有点饿，现在才想起摆在珀莱家餐桌上的茶点——小奶油面包和水——但是我又不想回去，于是走进一家面包店，要了一份充饥的couc——这是一个佛兰芒词，我不知道怎么拼它——是科林斯语加英语构成的，意思就是一种内有葡萄干的圆形甜面包——还有一杯咖啡；吃完后我又朝卢汶门慢慢走去。","‘She has probably left Brussels—perhaps is gone to England, as she said she would,’ muttered I inwardly, as on the afternoon of the fourth Sunday I turned from the door of the chapel-royal, which the doorkeeper had just closed and locked, and followed in the wake of the last of the congregation, now dispersed and dispersing over the square.I had soon outwalked the couples of English gentlemen and ladies.(Gracious goodness!why don’t they dress better?My eye is yet filled with visions of the high-flounced, slovenly, and rumbled dresses in costly silk and satin, of the large unbecoming collars in expensive lace, of the ill-cut coats and strangely fashioned pantaloons which every Sunday, at the English service, filled the choirs of the chapel-royal, and after it issuing forth into the square, came into disadvantageous contrast with freshly and trimly attired foreign figures, hastening to attend salut at the church of Coburg.)I had passed these pairs of Britons, and the groups of pretty British children, and the British footmen and waiting-maids; I had crossed the Place Royale, and got into the Rue Royale; thence I had diverged into the Rue de Louvain, an old and quiet street.I remember that, feeling a little hungry, and not desiring to go back and take my share of the gouter, now on the refectory table at Pelet’s—to wit, pistolets and water—I stepped into a baker’s and refreshed myself on a couc—it is a Flemish word, I don’t know how to spell it—A Corinthe—anglice, a currant bun—and a cup of coffee; and then I strolled on towards the Porte de Louvain."
"我很快便走出了市区，慢慢登着山，那山从城门外就开始向上倾斜了，我不慌不忙地登着；因为是下午，所以虽然多云，但仍很闷热，没有一丝风来让空气清新一下。布鲁塞尔居民无须走太远去寻求宁静，只要走到城外半里格，他就会发现这座城正静静地、茫然地凝望着广阔的田野沉思，环绕着布拉班特首都的田野虽然肥沃，但也很沉闷，放眼望去，没有树木，也没有道路。我登上山顶，驻足良久，俯瞰着那虽已开垦却了无生气的田野，顿时有一种想法，就是离开来时走的公路踏进那些耕地——它们如同布罗布丁纳格菜地的菜一样肥沃——耕地向前方延伸开来，遥远而宽阔，直到地平线，它的颜色也由深绿变成暗蓝，与暴雨之前的铅灰色天空融为一体；于是，我拐入了右边上的一条岔道。没走多久，这小道就正如我所预料的那样把我带进了农田，一座高耸且长的白墙立在我面前的农田之中，从墙上方露出的叶子可以猜出，里面是一些种植着茂密的紫杉和柏树的苗圃，因为那些搭在白色低矮围墙上的正是这两种树的树枝。这些树阴沉地环绕着一个无疑是矗立在围墙中央的巨大十字架，同时十字架展开的黑色大理石双臂又凌驾在那些不祥的树冠之上。我向前走去，想知道这个守卫森严的花园是谁家的；我转过墙角，心想该会看到庄严宏伟的住宅。我来到大铁门前。那边有一间用作门房的小屋；不过我不需要钥匙——大门是开着的。我推开一扇门——门上的铰链已经被雨腐蚀了，因而门转动时铰链发出阴沉的吱吱声。入口被浓密的植物遮蔽着。我穿过林阴大道，看到在左右两边到处刻着铭文和标志，这些清楚地告诉我自己来到了什么地方。这是个为所有活着的人准备的房间，那些十字架，墓碑还有石刻花圈都说明这里是“卢汶门外基督教公墓”。","Very soon I was out of the city, and slowly mounting the hill, which ascends from the gate, I took my time; for the afternoon, though cloudy, was very sultry, and not a breeze stirred to refresh the atmosphere.No inhabitant of Brussels need wander far to search for solitude; let him but move half a league from his own city, and he will find her brooding still and blank over the wide fields, so drear though so fertile, spread out treeless and trackless round the capital of Brabant.Having gained the summit of the hill, and having stood and looked long over the cultured but lifeless campaign, I felt a wish to quit the highroad, which I had hitherto followed, and get in among those tilled grounds—fertile as the beds of a Brobdignagian kitchen-garden—spreading far and wide even to the boundaries of the horizon, where from a dusk green distance changed them to a sullen blue, and confused their tints with those of the livid and thunderous-looking sky. Accordingly I turned up a by-path to the right.I had not followed it far ere it brought me, as I expected, into the fields, amidst which, just before me, stretched a long and lofty white wall enclosing, as it seemed from the foliage showing above, some thickly planted nursery of yew and cypress, for of that species were the branches resting on the pale parapets, and crowding gloomily about a massive cross, planted doubtless on a central eminence and extending its arms, which seemed of black marble, over the summits of those sinister trees.I approached, wondering to what house this well-protected garden appertained; I turned the angle of the wall, thinking to see some stately residence.I was close upon great iron gates.There was a hut serving for a lodge near; but I had no occasion to apply for the key—the gates were open.I pushed one leaf back—rain had rusted its hinges, for it groaned dolefully as they revolved.Thick planting embowered the entrance.Passing up the avenue, I saw objects on each hand which, in their own mute language of inscription and sign, explained clearly to what abode I had made my way. This was the house appointed for all living; crosses, monuments, and garlands of everlastings announced, ‘The Protestant Cemetery, outside the gate of Louvain.’"
"这个地方很大，即使不走回头路也足够在里面转上半个小时；而对于那些喜欢研究墓场年鉴的人来说，这些各种各样的碑文足够他花上两到三倍的时间去研究。这里埋葬着不同血统、不同语言、不同国家的人；在那一块块用石头、大理石或者青铜做成的墓碑上，分别用英语、法语、德语、拉丁语刻着那些长眠者的姓名、生卒年月、以及献给他们的最后歌颂或敬爱之词。这里有一个英国人在玛丽·史密斯或者简·布朗的遗体上竖了一个大理石墓碑，上面仅仅刻着她的名字。在那边一个法国鳏夫在他的爱弥尔或塞莱斯蒂纳的坟前堆满了绚丽的玫瑰花丛，花丛中立着的碑上写着同样绚丽的话语，作为对她诉说不尽的美德的见证。每个国家，每个部落，每个家族都以自己的方式哀悼死者，而所有哀悼都如此无声无息！尽管小路的起伏很流畅，我自己的步子也放得很慢，但是脚步声听起来仍触目惊心，因为它是墓场肃杀气氛的唯一破坏者，或者说，全部破坏者。那天下午像是达成共识一般，不只是风，就连一阵阵飘荡的气流都躲到各处睡觉了：北边一片肃静，南边一片沉静，东边十分安静，西边也不再低语，沉静了。天上的云像被挤压了，毫无光彩，但也显然一动不动。公墓的树下萦绕着一种闷热且令人窒息的阴暗，沉默的柏树冲破了这阴暗，笔直耸立着，阴暗上方的柳枝也纹丝不动低垂着；花儿们懒散无力，无精打采地等着夜露或者雷雨；只有那些树阴下的坟墓及其掩盖的长眠者们无动于衷地躺在那里，不理会是艳阳还是阴暗，是雨水还是干旱。","The place was large enough to afford half an hour’s strolling without the monotony of treading continually the same path; and for those who love to peruse the annals of graveyards here was variety of inscription enough to occupy the attention for double or treble that space of time.Hither people of many kindreds, tongues, and nations had brought their dead for interment; and here, on pages of stone, of marble, and of brass, were written names, dates, last tributes of pomp or love, in English, in French, in German, and Latin.Here the Englishman had erected a marble monument over the remains of his Mary Smith or Jane Brown, and inscribed it only with her name.There the French widower had shaded the grave of his Elmire or Celestine with a brilliant thicket of roses, amidst which a little tablet rising bore an equally bright testimony to her countless virtues.Every nation, tribe, and kindred mourned after its own fashion; and how soundless was the mourning of all!My own tread, though slow and upon smooth-rolled paths, seemed to startle, because it formed the sole break to a silence, otherwise total.Not only the winds but the very fitful, wandering airs, were that afternoon, as by common consent, all fallen asleep in their various quarters: the north was hushed, the south silent, the east sobbed not, nor did the west whisper.The clouds in heaven were condensed and dull, but apparently quite motionless.Under the trees of this cemetery nestled a warm, breathless gloom, out of which the cypresses stood up straight and mute, above which the willows hung low and still; where the flowers, as languid as fair, waited listless for night-dew or thunder-shower; where the tombs, and those they hid, lay impassible to sun or shadow, to rain or drought."
"因为不愿再让自己的脚步声打破这宁静，我离开小道走上了草地，慢慢地向一片紫杉林迈进。我看见有个东西在林中晃动。我原以为那可能是一根断枝在摆动——我眼睛近视，没看清楚形状，只是感觉到它在动弹——但那黑黝黝的形状在林荫道的空旷处若隐若现。不久我便发现那个东西是有生命的，而且是个人。直到靠近点，我才发现是个女人在那里慢慢地走来走去，而且显然和我一样以为自己是一个人在这儿，也和我一样在这里沉思。不久她便回到一个座位上，我猜想她刚刚才从那边站起来，或者说我应该刚刚就看到她在那坐着了。那是在一个角落里，被一丛丛的树掩蔽着。她面前是那座白墙，靠墙竖立着一块小石碑，石碑底下的草地是刚翻过的——这是一座新坟。我带上眼镜，轻轻地贴着她身后走过，瞥了一眼石头上刻的字，写道：“朱利安娜·亨利，卒于布鲁塞尔，享年六十，一八几几年八月十日。”细读完这些碑文，我把目光转向弯腰坐在我眼前思索的身影，她竟然对我这个近在咫尺的生命体毫无感觉。那是一个身材修长，十分年轻的身影，身穿最普通的黑布孝服，头戴一顶小巧简单的黑色孝帽。我感觉到，也看出来那是谁了；我在那站了一阵，从头到脚一动不动，享受着这种认出她的喜悦。我已经找了她一个月，从没发现过她的一丝行踪，我以为没有任何希望任何机会再见到她了。仅仅是一个小时前，我已经被迫放弃希望了，已经无力地坠入了令人沮丧的念头：生活的洪流与命运的冲力已将她永远地卷离我的身边；但没想到，当我被消沉的意志压得低下头——就在我用目光寻找墓场草皮上的悲哀脚印之时——我却在这找到了我丢失的珍宝，它就落在用眼泪灌溉的草地上，倚在生满苔藓腐烂发霉的杉树根下。","Importuned by the sound of my own footsteps, I turned off upon the turf, and slowly advanced to a grove of yews.I saw something stir among the stems.I thought it might be a broken branch swinging—my short-sighted vision had caught no form, only a sense of motion—but the dusky shade passed on, appearing and disappearing at the openings in the avenue.I soon discerned it was a living thing, and a human thing.And drawing nearer, I perceived it was a woman, pacing slowly to and fro, and evidently deeming herself alone as I had deemed myself alone, and meditating as I had been meditating.Ere long she returned to a seat which I fancy she had but just quitted, or I should have caught sight of her before.It was in a nook, screened by a clump of trees.There was the white wall before her, and a little stone set up against the wall, and at the foot of the stone was an allotment of turf freshly turned up—a new- made grave.I put on my spectacles, and passed softly close behind her; glancing at the inscription on the stone, I read, ‘Julienne Henri, died at Brussels, aged sixty, August 10th, 18--.’Having perused the inscription, I looked down at the form sitting bent and thoughtful just under my eyes, unconscious of the vicinity of any living thing.It was a slim, youthful figure in mourning apparel of the plainest black stuff, with a little, simple black crape bonnet.I felt, as well as saw, who it was; and moving neither hand nor foot, I stood some moments enjoying the security of conviction.I had sought her for a month, and had never discovered one of her traces, never met a hope or seized a chance of encountering her anywhere.I had been forced to loosen my grasp on expectation, and, but an hour ago, had sunk slackly under the discouraging thought that the current of life and the impulse of destiny had swept her for ever from my reach; and, behold, while bending sullenly earthward beneath the pressure of despondency—while following with my eyes the track of sorrow on the turf of a graveyard—here was my lost jewel dropped on the tear-fed herbage, nestling in the mossy and mouldy roots of yew trees."
"弗朗西斯十分安静地坐在那里，胳膊撑在膝盖上，手托着脸。我知道她会长时间坐在那一动不动，一直思考着问题。最终一滴泪水夺眶而出。她一直盯着面前石碑上的名字，内心无疑一直忍受着那种生者追忆故人时所感到的被遗弃的痛苦。泪水不停滚落，她用手帕擦了又擦，却悲伤地呜咽起来，最后在一阵伤心的痛哭后，她再次安静地坐在那。我轻轻地将手搭在她的肩膀上，没有必要让她多做准备，因为她既不会歇斯底里，也不会吓昏到不省人事。我猛地推她一下，确实会使她大吃一惊；但是正如我想象的那样，我静静地碰碰她，仅仅唤起了她的注意，尽管她快速转过脸来——尤其，在某些人看来像是闪电一样快——但是我相信，在她做出那个突然的动作之前，她的脑海里已经闪过究竟是什么人偷偷闯进她的孤独，甚至已经闪入她的心房，至少，在她没有因认出我而眼中闪着最富表情的亮光之前，这惊讶没有使她睁开眼睛来看我。在她整张脸上露出清晰、热情、最生动的喜悦前，她并没有因为紧张而显得吃惊不已。我几乎没时间观察她那憔悴苍白的神色，便看见她整个脸上都泛起强烈的喜悦的光芒，涌出片片红晕，焕发着光芒，没等我对此表示由衷的高兴，那红晕已经在我学生的脸上蔓延开了。这是沉闷的夏天阵雨之后露出的第一缕阳光，还有什么比这束阳光发展得更快呢，那简直是像炽烈燃烧的火焰！","Frances sat very quiet, her elbow on her knee and her head on her hand.I knew she could retain a thinking attitude a long time without change.At last a tear fell.She had been looking at the name on the stone before her, and her heart had no doubt endured one of those constrictions with which the desolate living, regretting the dead, are at times so sorely oppressed.Many tears rolled down, which she wiped away again and again with her handkerchief; some distressed sobs escaped her, and then, the paroxysm over, she sat quiet as before.I put my hand gently on her shoulder; no need further to prepare her, for she was neither hysterical nor liable to fainting fits.A sudden push, indeed, might have startled her, but the contact of my quiet touch merely woke attention as I wished; and though she turned quickly, yet so lightning-swift is thought—in some minds especially—I believe the wonder of what, the consciousness of who it was that thus stole unawares on her solitude, had passed through her brain and flashed into her heart even before she had effected that hasty movement; at least Amazement had hardly opened her eyes and raised them to mine ere Recognition informed their irids with most speaking brightness.Nervous surprise had hardly discomposed her features ere a sentiment of most vivid joy shone clear and warm on her whole countenance.I had hardly time to observe that she was wasted and pale, ere called to feet a responsive inward pleasure by the sense of most full and exquisite pleasure glowing in the animated flush, and shining in the expansive light, now diffused over my pupil’s face.It was the summer sun flashing out after the heavy summer shower; and what fertilizes more rapidly than that beam, burning almost like fire in its ardour?"
"我讨厌冒失——那种厚颜无耻的眉目传情和毫无情感的神经质的冒失；但是我喜欢坚强心灵的勇气，喜欢那种大方开朗的热情。我十分喜欢弗朗西斯·埃文斯那清澈的淡褐色眼睛毫不畏惧地直视我的眼睛时所闪烁的光芒。我喜欢她叫我时的声调：","I hate boldness—that boldness which is of the brassy brow and insensate nerves; but I love the courage of the strong heart, the favour of the generous blood.I loved with passion the light of Frances Evans’s clear haze eye when it did not fear to look straight into mine.I loved the tones with which she uttered the words,—"
"“老师！老师！”","‘Mon maître!mon maître!’"
"我喜欢此时此刻她把手放在我手里。我喜欢她站在那的模样，身无分文，无父无母，对于好色之徒来说她毫无魅力，但对我来说她就是块珍宝——她是我这个世界上最同情的人，她想我所想，感我所感；她是我储藏爱的理想圣地；她是谨慎与远见、勤勉与毅力、克己与自制的化身——我渴望将我的礼物交给她，交给这样一个值得信赖的人看管——那就是我的全部感情；她是诚实、忠贞、独立和责任感的典范，这些品质能够维持一种真正的生活；她默默地拥有一口深井，充满了温柔和激情，她和蔼宁静，纯洁超然，天生感情丰富而强烈——这些对组成一个美好家庭都是必要的，是温馨舒适的来源。我知道她心里的井是多么地平静而深邃；我知道那危险的火焰在她理智的目光下燃烧得多么安全；我曾见过当火焰产生的热量扰乱生命之河时，火焰会在瞬间窜高迸裂；我也曾见过理智战胜反抗，将火焰泯为灰烬。","I loved the movement with which she confided her hand to my hand.I loved her as she stood there, penniless and parentless; for a sensualist charmless, for me a treasure—my best object of sympathy on earth, thinking such thoughts as I thought, feeling such feelings as I felt; my ideal of the shrine in which to seal my stores of love; personification of discretion and forethought, of diligence and perseverance, of self-denial and self-control—those guardians, those trusty keepers of the gift I longed to confer on her—the gift of all my affections;model of truth and honour, of independence and conscientiousness—those refiners and sustainers of an honest life; silent possessor of a well of tenderness, of a flame, as genial as still, as pure as quenchless, of natural feeling, natural passion—those sources of refreshment and comfort to the sanctuary of home.I knew how quietly and how deeply the well bubbled in her heart; I knew how the more dangerous flame burned safely under the eye of reason; I had seen when the fire shot up a moment high and vivid, when the accelerated heat troubled life’s current in its channels; I had seen reason reduce the rebel, and humble its blaze to embers."
"我对弗朗西斯·埃文斯有信心；我尊重她，当我挽着她的手臂带她走出那块墓地时，我有了另一种感情，如同信心一样强烈，同敬重一样坚定，又比两者都要热忱——那就是爱。","I had confidence in Frances Evans; I had respect for her, and as I drew her arm through mine and led her out of the cemetery, I felt I had another sentiment, as strong as confidence, as firm as respect, more fervid than either—that of love."
"“好了，我的学生，”当那发出刺耳声音的铁门在我们身后关上时，我说道：“这下，我又找到你了。我已经苦寻你一个月之久了，怎么也没想到我迷失的羔羊会在墓场里晃荡。”","‘Well, my pupil,’ said I, as the ominous-sounding gate swung to behind us—‘well, I have found you again.A month’s search has seemed long, and I little thought to have discovered my lost sheep straying amongst graves.’"
"我以前都是称呼她“小姐”，而现在这样说话，对我们来说都是一种崭新的方式。她的回答让我知道她对这种方式并不生气也不反感。","Never had I addressed her but as ‘mademoiselle’ before, and to speak thus was to take up a tone new to both her and me.Her answer apprised me that this language ruffled none of her feelings, woke no discord in her heart."
"“老师，”她说，“您真的这么费心找我？我从没想过您会这么关心我的去留，但是被人从您身边赶走我确实很伤心。对那件事我真的很抱歉，更加沉重的打击本该使我忘记它，但我忘不了。”","‘Mon maitre,’ she said, ‘have you troubled yourself to seek me?I little imagined you would think much of my absence, but I grieved bitterly to be taken away from you.I was sorry for that circumstance when heavier troubles ought to have made me forget it.’"
"“你姑妈过世了？”","‘Your aunt is dead?’"
"“是的，两个星期前过世的。她离开的时候满心遗憾，但我不知道她的遗憾是什么。她生前的最后一个晚上还一直在重复说，‘弗朗西斯，我走了之后你该有多么孤单呐——无亲无友。’她也很希望自己能够葬在瑞士，当初是我劝她在花甲之年离开莱芒河畔，来到这地势平坦的法兰德斯地区的，但似乎只是叫她来送死。我多么想能满足她最后一个愿望，将她的遗体运回祖国，但那是不可能的。我只得把她葬在这。”","‘Yes, a fortnight since, and she died full of regret, which I could not chase from her mind.She kept repeating, even during the last night of her existence, “Frances, you will be so lonely when I am gone—so friendless.”She wished, too, that she could have been buried in Switzerland, and it was I who persuaded her in her old age to leave the banks of Lake Leman, and to come only, as it seems, to die in this flat region of Flanders.Willingly would I have observed her last wish, and taken her remains back to our own country, but that was impossible.I was forced to lay her here.’"
"“我猜她只病了很短一段时间吧？”","’She was ill but a short time, I presume?’"
"“只有三个星期。她生病之后，我向勒泰小姐请假回家照顾她陪伴她。她欣然地准了我的假。”","‘But three weeks.When she began to sink I asked Mdlle. Reuter’s leave to stay with her and wait on her.I readily got leave.’"
"“你还回学校吗？”我急忙问道。","‘Do you return to the pensionnat?’ I demanded hastily."
"“先生，我在家住了一个星期之后，一天晚上在我刚把姑妈送上床勒泰小姐就来了。她走到姑妈房间跟她谈话，像往常一样极其彬彬有礼而又和善可亲；后来她出来跟我坐了很久，当她起身离开时她说道：‘小姐，你教你们班学生教得很好，这是事实，她们都很熟练地掌握了你所教授的手工课，所以没有必要再教她们了。尽管如此，我还是会在未来一段时间内对你的离开感到很遗憾。考虑到这些还年轻的学生们，我又找到一个老师来接替你的工作，虽然她的手艺确实不如你，但她会尽她所能，毫无疑问你将另寻高就。我确定，凭你的能力，随处都可以找到愿意聘用你的学校和家庭。’说完，她便付了我最后一个季度的薪水。我像一般小姐肯定都会想到的那样，很直率地问她是不是想把我赶出学校。她对我的粗俗话语笑了笑，回答说‘我们的雇佣关系已经解除，但是她希望仍能和我保持朋友的友好关系，她愿意随时把我当做朋友’，然后她便说了些路况很好，天气很晴朗之类的话，很开心地走了。”","‘Monsieur, when I had been at home a week Mdlle. Reuter called one evening, just after I had got my aunt to bed. She went into her room to speak to her, and was extremely civil and affable, as she always is; afterwards she came and sat with me a long time, and just as she rose to go away she said, ‘Mademoiselle I shall not soon cease to regret your departure from my establishment, though indeed it is true that you have taught your class of pupils so well that they are all quite accomplished in the little works you manage so skilfully, and have not the slightest need of further instruction.My second teacher must in future supply your place, with regard to the younger pupils, as well as she can, though she is indeed an inferior artiste to you, and doubtless it will he your part now to assume a higher position in your calling.I am sure you will everywhere find schools and families willing to profit by your talents.” And then she paid me my last quarter’s salary.I asked, as mademoiselle would no doubt think, very bluntly, if she designed to discharge me from the establishment.She smiled at my inelegance of speech, and answered that “our connection as employer and employed was certainly dissolved, but that she hoped still to retain the pleasure of my acquaintance; she should always be happy to see me as a friend,” and then she said something about the excellent condition of the streets, and the long continuance of fine weather, and went away quite cheerful.’"
"我打从心底笑起来；这一切多么像校长啊——她的行为跟我所预料和猜测的极其相似，她撒谎的证据被弗朗西斯无意间揭露了。“她一直在询问亨利小姐的住址。”确实。“亨利小姐一直缄默不语，”等等，我才发现她竟然来这个她宣称一无所知的人家拜访过！","I laughed inwardly; all this was so like the directress—so like what I had expected and guessed of her conduct; and then the exposure and proof of her lie, unconsciously afforded by Frances.‘She had frequently applied for Mdlle. Henri’s address,’ forsooth.‘Mdlle. Henri had always evaded giving it,’ etc., etc., and here I found her a visitor at the very house of whose locality she had professed absolute ignorance!"
"我正想对我的学生所说的情况讲点什么，这时被哗哗啦啦的雨点打断了。豆大的雨滴打在我们脸上，落在小道上，嘀嘀咕咕地着预示远方马上有暴雨袭来。窒闷的空气和铅色的天空所发出的明显警告把我引上了返回布鲁塞尔的路，此刻我加快了脚步，同伴也加快了脚步，由于道路一直是下坡，我们走得很快。在真正的大雨来临前，之前的雨停了一会，我们趁机通过了卢汶门，又回到了城里。","Any comments I might have intended to make on my pupil’s communication were checked by the plashing of large rain-drops on our faces and on the path, and by the muttering of a distant but coming storm.The warning obvious in stagnant air and leaden sky had already induced me to take the road leading back to Brussels, and now I hastened my own steps and those of my companion, and as our way lay down hill, we got on rapidly.There was an interval after the fall of the first broad drops before heavy rain came on; in the meantime we had passed through the Porte de Louvain, and were again in the city."
"“你住在哪儿？”我问道，“我要将你安全送到家。”","‘Where do you live?’ I asked.‘I will see you safe home.’"
"“内日河畔圣母大街。”弗朗西斯回答道。","‘Rue Notre Dame aux Neiges,’ answered Frances."
"那里离卢汶大街不远，我们站到她家门前的台阶上时，乌云才被震耳的雷声划破，被刺眼的闪电撕碎，散开那铅色的皱痕，顷刻间，暴雨便如瀑布般倾泻而出。","It was not far from the Rue de Louvain, and we stood on the doorsteps of the house we sought ere the clouds, severing with loud peal and shattered cataract of lightning, emptied their livid folds in a torrent, heavy, prone, and broad."
"“进来吧！进来！”弗朗西斯走到屋里，见我没有跟上便喊道。她的话使我下定了决心。。我跨过门槛，将那闪电雷鸣的白茫茫暴雨关在门外，跟随她上楼来到她的房间。我们俩都没有被淋湿；门上方的一道房檐挡住了倾盆而下的大雨。我们的衣服上只沾了最初的几颗大雨点。如果再晚一分钟，我们浑身上下就不会有一块干的地方了。","‘Come in!come in!’ said Frances, as, after putting her into the house, I paused ere I followed.The word decided me. I stepped across the threshold, shut the door on the rushing flashing, whitening storm, and followed her upstairs to her apartments.Neither she nor I was wet; a projection over the door had warded off the straight-descending flood.None but the first large drops had touched our garments.One minute more and we should not have had a dry thread on us."
"踏过一小块绿色的羊毛垫子，我发现自己置身于一个小房间，油漆的地板中间是一块绿地毯。房间内家具很少，但都很明亮，并且极其干净；地方虽小，但摆设得井井有条——这种井然抚慰了我拘谨的心灵。我犹豫着是否要进她的房间，因为我想起了勒泰小姐的话，担心她家徒四壁，这样贸然闯入会使这位修补花边的小姐尴尬。这个地方也许很穷，或者真的很穷，但是它的整洁胜过了高贵，只要那干净的壁炉上有明亮的一小簇火焰在燃着，我就敢说它比宫殿更有魅力。然而室内没有生火，也没有放着要烧的木柴；这位补花边的小姐没有能力允许自己乱用钱，尤其是现在她唯一的亲人刚刚去世，手头很紧，又无人接济，她不得不自食其力。弗朗西斯到里屋脱下帽子，出来的时候浑然一个朴素又整洁的模特，身着合体的黑色素裙，准确地勾勒出她的酥胸与纤腰，纯白的领子向后翻卷，露出白皙姣好的脖颈，浓密的褐色头发整齐地由两鬓向后梳去，在后面编成一条希腊式的大辫子。她没有装饰品——既没有胸针、耳环，也没有丝带；没有那些，她一样打扮得很体面——那完美的体型，匀称的身段，优雅的姿态，都恰到好处地体现出来。她一回到这小客厅便找寻我的目光，此刻我正盯着壁炉看。看着那冰冷空荡的壁炉，我的心里涌起一阵怜惜之痛，我知道她立刻看出了我的心思。她理解得快，决定得快，行动得更快，她立马在腰间系上荷兰麻布围裙，走了出去，不一会拿着个篮子回来了；篮子有个盖，她打开盖子，拿出木柴和煤炭，熟练利索地将它们放入壁炉。","Stepping over a little mat of green wool, I found myself in a small room with a painted floor and a square of green carpet in the middle.The articles of furniture were few, but all bright and exquisitely clean; order reigned through its narrow limits—such order as it soothed my punctilious soul to behold.And I had hesitated to enter the abode, because I apprehended after all that Mdlle. Reuter’s hint about its extreme poverty might be too well founded, and I feared to embarrass the lace-mender by entering her lodgings unawares!Poor the place might be; poor truly it was; but its neatness was better than elegance, and had but a bright little fire shone on that clean hearth, I should have deemed it more attractive than a palace.No fire was there, however, and no fuel laid ready to light; the lace-mender was unable to allow herself that indulgence especially now when, deprived by death of her sole relative she had only her own unaided exertions to rely on.Frances went into an inner room to take off her bonnet, and she came out a model of frugal neatness, with her well- fitting black stuff dress, so accurately defining her elegant bust and taper waist, with her spotless white collar turned back from a fair and shapely neck, with her plenteous brown hair arranged in smooth bands on her temples, and in a large Grecian plait behind.Ornaments she had none—neither brooch, ring, nor ribbon; she did well enough without them—perfection of fit, proportion of form, grace of carriage, agreeably supplied their place.Her eye, as she re-entered the small sitting-room, instantly sought mine, which was just then lingering on the hearth.I knew she read at once the sort of inward ruth and pitying pain which the chill vacancy of that hearth stirred in my soul.Quick to penetrate, quick to determine, and quicker to put in practice, she had in a moment tied a holland apron round her waist; then she disappeared, and reappeared with a basket; it had a cover; she opened it, and produced wood and coal; deftly and compactly she arranged them in the grate."
"“她就剩那么一点，但是为了招待客人她会全部用上。”我想道。","‘It is her whole stock, and she will exhaust it out of hospitality,’ thought I."
"“你要干什么？”我问道，“不会这么热的晚上还生火吧？我会被闷死的。”","‘What are you going to do?’ I asked; ‘not surely to light a fire this hot evening?I shall be smothered.’"
"“是的，先生，下雨了，我感到冷嗖嗖的。而且我还要生火泡茶，因为我周日都要喝茶的；只能委屈您忍受一下热了。”","‘Indeed, monsieur, I feel it very chilly since the rain began.Besides, I must boil the water for my tea, for I take tea on Sundays; you will be obliged to try and bear the heat.’"
"她划着一根火柴，木柴便燃烧起来；说真的，与外面的黑暗和吵闹的大雨比起来，那壁炉上静静燃烧的火焰都变得很令人振奋了。某处传来一阵低沉的呜呜声，似乎除了我之外还有个生命对这个变化感到高兴：是一只黑猫，它正在一个铺着地毯的小脚凳旁睡觉，被火光惊醒，便跑了出来，用脑袋蹭着跪在那里的弗朗西斯的长袍。她抚摸着它，说它是她“可怜的朱莉安娜姑妈”的心头至爱。","She had struck a light; the wood was already in a blaze; and truly, when contrasted with the darkness, the wild tumult of the tempest without, that peaceful glow which began to beam on the now animated hearth seemed very cheering.A low, purring sound from some quarter announced that another being besides myself was pleased with the change: a black cat, roused by the light from its sleep on a little cushioned footstool, came and rubbed its head against Frances‘ gown as she knelt.She caressed it, saying it had been a favourite with her ‘pauvre tante Julienne.’"
"生起了火，打扫完壁炉，弗朗西斯把一个样式极为古老的小水壶放在红红的火焰上，那个小水壶我记得曾在英国的一些古老农舍见过。弗朗西斯洗过了手，又马上解下围裙。然后她打开壁橱拿出一个茶盘，不一会儿就在上面摆好了一套陶瓷茶具，茶具的式样、形状以及大小都极为古老；她又在每个小碟子里摆上一只老式银勺；在糖罐里又摆上同样老式的银钳子，接着又从壁橱里拿出一个鸡蛋大小的银质奶酪罐。在进行这一系列的准备时，她还间或抬起头来看看我，看出我眼里的好奇，便微笑着问道，——","The fire being lit, the hearth swept, and a small kettle of a very antique pattern, such as I thought I remembered to have seen in old farmhouses in England, placed over the now ruddy flame, Frances’ hands were washed, and her apron removed in an instant.Then she opened a cupboard, and took out a tea-tray, on which she had soon arranged a china tea-equipage, whose pattern, shape, and size denoted a remote antiquity; a little, old-fashioned silver spoon was deposited in each saucer; and a pair of silver tongs, equally old-fashioned, were laid on the sugar-basin; from the cupboard, too, was produced a tiny silver cream-ewer, not larger than an egg-shell.While making these preparations, she chanced to look up, and reading curiosity in my eyes, she smiled and asked,—"
"“像是在英格兰吗，先生？”","‘Is this like England, monsieur?’"
"“像是在一百年前的英格兰，”我回答道。","‘Like the England of a hundred years ago,’ I replied."
"“真的吗？这个茶盘上所有东西都有至少一百年的历史了。这些茶杯，这些勺子，还有这个罐子都是传家宝；我的曾祖母将它们传给我的祖母，我的祖母又传给我母亲，我母亲将它们从英格兰带到瑞士，然后传给我；从我是个小姑娘时起我就想将它们带回英格兰，回到它们的故乡去。”","‘Is it truly?Well, everything on this tray is at least a hundred years old. These cups, these spoons, this ewer, are all heirlooms; my great-grandmother left them to my grandmother, she to my mother, and my mother brought them with her from England to Switzerland, and left them to me; and ever since I was a little girl I have thought I should like to carry them back to England, whence they came.’"
"她放了些奶油面包在桌上。她沏上茶，就像外国人那样沏茶——我是说，把一茶匙茶叶分到六个杯子里。她给我摆好一把椅子，我就座后，她不无得意地问道：","She put some pistolets on the table.She made the tea, as foreigners do make tea—that is, at the rate of a teaspoonful to half a dozen cups.She placed me a chair, and as I took it she asked, with a sort of exultation,—"
"“会不会让你觉得现在是在家里？”","‘Will it make you think yourself at home for a moment?’"
"“如果我在英格兰有家，我相信我会有那种感觉。”我回答说。事实上，看着这位肤色白皙、长得像英格兰人的姑娘在做着英式茶点，又讲着英语，确实会有几分那种错觉。","‘If I had a home in England, I believe it would recall it,’ I answered; and, in truth, there was a sort of illusion in seeing the fair-complexioned English-looking girl presiding at the English meal and speaking in the English language."
"“那您没有家了？”她问道。","‘You have, then, no home?’ was her remark."
"“没有，也从来没有过。如果我有家的话，那一定要是我自己建立的家庭，但这个任务我还没开始做。”我说着这些话，一种从未经历过的刺痛穿过我的心。那是一种因为地位低下、金钱匮乏而感到羞辱的痛苦，伴随着这种痛苦，我也产生了一种强烈的欲望，那就是努力工作，努力多赚钱，出人头地，拥有更多；随着财富不断增多，我势必会渴望创建一个我从来没有过的家庭，娶到我心里暗暗发誓要娶的妻子。","‘None, nor ever have had.If ever I possess a home, it must be of my own making, and the task is yet to begin.’ And as I spoke, a pang, new to me, shot across my heart.It was a pang of mortification at the humility of my position and the inadequacy of my means, while with that pang was born a strong desire to do more, earn more, be more, possess more; and in the increased possessions my roused and eager spirit panted to include the home I had never had, the wife I inwardly vowed to win."
"弗朗西斯的茶比热水、糖水或者牛奶好不了多少，她的面包上也没有黄油，但我尝起来却觉得比吗哪还可口。","Frances’ tea was little better than hot water, sugar, and milk-, and her pistolets, with which she could not offer me butter, were sweet to my palate as manna."
"用完餐，弗朗西斯洗完那些珍贵的茶盘和瓷器后又收了起来，本来就很光亮的桌子被她擦得更加光亮，“我朱莉安娜姑妈的小猫”特别享受了她端来的一盘食物。之后她又扫去壁炉上散落的炉渣和煤灰，终于坐了下来；当她拿过一把椅子和我面对面坐着时，我第一次看见她显露出一丝窘迫不安。这也不足为奇，因为我不自觉地过于专注地盯着她看，始终过于关注她的一举一动：因为她优雅熟练的动作迷住了我——那纤纤细手的每一个动作都那么灵巧利索，甚至富有艺术魅力；当她最终静静地坐下来时，她脸上所流露出的智慧对我来说简直美极了，于是我沉溺了。她的脸色非但没有因为沉默而镇定下来，反而更加兴奋，她的眼神还是有点悲伤，虽然我一直期待着她能够抬起眼帘好让我欣赏一下我喜爱的目光——在那种目光下，烈火能被温柔熄灭，锐气能被情感削弱，至少在此刻，欢乐能够玩弄思想——但是我的这个期待并没有得到满足，我最后才意识到这种失望很可能只怪我自己。要想打破这种她坐在那一动不动的僵局，我就不能再盯着她看，而要跟她说话。想起以前我对她所采用的那种权威式的语气在她身上往往能起舒缓作用，我对她说：","The repast over, and the treasured plate and porcelain being washed and put by, the bright table rubbed still brighter, ‘le chat de ma tante Julienne’ also being fed with provisions brought forth on a plate for its special use, a few stray cinders, and a scattering of ashes too, being swept from the hearth, Frances at last sat down; and then, as she took a chair opposite to me, she betrayed, for the first time, a little embarrassment.And no wonder, for indeed I had unconsciously watched her rather too closely, followed all her steps and all her movements a little too perseveringly with my eyes: for she mesmerized me by the grace and alertness of her action—by the deft, cleanly, and even decorative effect resulting from each touch of her slight and fine fingers; and when at last she subsided to stillness, the intelligence of her face seemed beauty to me, and I dwelt on it accordingly.Her colour, however, rising rather than settling with repose, and her eyes remaining downcast, though I kept waiting for the lids to be raised that I might drink a ray of the light I loved—a light where fire dissolved in softness, where affection tempered penetration, where, just now at least, pleasure played with thought—this expectation not being gratified, I began at last to suspect that I had probably myself to blame for the disappointment.I must cease gazing, and begin talking, if I wished to break the spell under which she now sat motionless.So recollecting the composing effect which an authoritative tone and manner had ever been wont to produce on her, I said,—"
"“小姐，拿一本英语书出来，因为雨还下得很大，我可能还得再呆半个小时。”她一下子松了一口气，站起身拿了一本书，转身坐在我给她在我旁边安排的椅子上。她从古典文学书架上选了一本《失乐园》，我猜她觉得宗教性质的书最适合礼拜天读。我让她从头读起，当她读到弥尔顿向神圣的缪斯祈祷，缪斯曾在“神秘的奥勒布山或西奈山山顶”向一位希伯来牧羊人讲述世界的概念是怎样从混沌的状态中产生并且成熟的，我完全沉浸于三重享受之中：一是她在我的身边，二是听见她的嗓音——在我耳边那甜美悦耳的嗓音——，三是不时欣赏一下她的面孔。最后一种享受我是通过纠正她语调、顿号或者重音等方式达到的，只要我坚持自己的意见时我便盯着她看，但也不至让她羞红脸。","‘Get one of your English books, mademoiselle; for the rain yet falls heavily, and will probably detain me half an hour longer.Released and set at ease, up she rose, got her book, and accepted at once the chair I placed for her at my side.She had selected ’Paradise Lost‘ from her shelf of classics, thinking, I suppose, the religious character of the book best adapted it to Sunday.I told her to begin at the beginning, and while she read Milton’s invocation to that heavenly muse, who on the ‘secret top of Oreb or of Sinai’ had taught the Hebrew shepherd how in the womb of chaos the conception of a world had originated and ripened, I enjoyed, undisturbed, the treble pleasure of having her near me, hearing the sound of her voice—a sound sweet and satisfying in my ear—and looking by intervals at her face.Of this last privilege I chiefly availed myself when I found fault with an intonation, a pause, or an emphasis; as long as I dogmatized I might also gaze, without exciting too warm a flush."
"“可以了，”当她读完六页左右我对她说（她读了很长时间，因为她读得很慢，还经常停下来问我问题，并听我给她讲解），“可以了；现在雨停了，我必须马上走了。”因为那时我朝窗外看，天空确实已经变蓝了。乌云已经四散开来，八月的夕阳透过窗格投入一束光芒，犹如红宝石上的反光。我站了起来，戴上了手套。","‘Enough,’ said I, when she had gone through some half-dozen pages (a work of time with her, for she read slowly, and paused often to ask and receive information), ‘enough; and now the rain is ceasing, and I must soon go.’ For, indeed, at that moment, looking towards the window, I saw it all blue.The thunder-clouds were broken and scattered, and the setting August sun sent a gleam like the reflection of rubies through the lattice.I got up; I drew on my gloves."
"“你被勒泰小姐解雇后还没有找到适合的职位吧？”","‘You have not yet found another situation to supply the place of that from which you were dismissed by Mdlle. Reuter?’"
"“没有，先生。我到处都问过了，但是他们都向我要介绍信；说真话，我不想去找那个女校长，因为我觉得她对我所做的既不公正也不体面。她用阴险的手段教唆学生跟我对着干，让我在她那工作得很不愉快；她最终又用虚假伪善的手段解雇了我，还声称她那样做是为了我好，但是实际上是在关键时候断了我主要的生活来源，因为彼时不光我要生活，还有另外一个人的生活也在靠我维持。我不会再求她什么。”","‘No, monsieur.I have made inquiries everywhere, but they all ask me for references; and to speak truth, I do not like to apply to the directress, because I consider she acted neither justly nor honourably towards me.She used underhand means to set my pupils against me, and thereby render me unhappy while I held my place in her establishment; and she eventually deprived me of it by a masked and hypocritical manÂ¦uvre, pretending that she was acting for my good, but really snatching from me my chief means of subsistence, at a crisis when not only my own life, but that of another, depended on my exertions.Of her I will never more ask a favour.’"
"“那么你打算怎么办呢？你现在要怎么过活？”","‘How, then, do you propose to get on?How do you live now?’"
"“我还有一些修补花边的活，认真点还不至于饿死，而且我坚信只要我努力还是可以找到好一点的职位的。我才试着找了两个星期的工作，我的勇气和信心还没有枯竭。”","‘I have still my lace-mending trade; with care it will keep me from starvation, and I doubt not by dint of exertion to get better employment yet. It is only a fortnight since I began to try; my courage or hopes are by no means worn out yet.’"
"“如果你能找到工作，之后怎样呢？你的最终目标是什么呢？”","‘And if you get what you wish, what then?What are your ultimate views?’"
"“攒足够的钱，穿过英吉利海峡。我一直把英格兰当做我的乐土。”","‘To save enough to cross the Channel.I always look to England as my Canaan.’"
"“好的，好的，不久后我会再来看你，现在晚安了。”就这样我突然地离开了她。我费了很大力气才抵制住内心的强烈欲望，那种欲望促使我想要跟她告别时更温情些，更意味深长些。如果将她紧紧拥入怀中一阵，再在她脸蛋和额头上亲吻一下，那也是很自然吧？我并非不切实际，那就是我想要的全部。那样的话我就可以心满意足地走了。然而理智甚至连这一点也没有允许我。它命令我从她脸上收回目光，从她的房间走出去——像离开珀莱夫人那样冷淡无情地离开她。我服从了，但是我满怀恨意地发誓终有一天要报复。在这场抗争中，我宁死也要赢得想干什么就干什么的权利。现在在我前方有一个目标——就是要娶到那位日内瓦姑娘为妻，只要她对我这个老师的关心跟我对她的关心一样或者只有一半，那我就要娶她为妻。如果她不是那样关心我，那在我教她学习时她怎么会那么温顺，那样微笑而且那么开心呢？当我口授或者改错时，她为何那么安静，那么满足又那么愉快地坐在我身边？我之前说过，当我走进房间时，不管之前她的脸色多么地伤心或者多么地苦闷，只要我走到她的身边，跟对她说上几句话，给她一点指导，或者责备她几句，她都会立刻陷入幸福之中，平静又振奋地抬头看着我。我的责备在她那儿最适用。当我责怪她时，她总是拿着一把铅笔刀削着铅笔或者钢笔，烦躁不安地噘着嘴巴，不时简短地为自己辩解几句。每当我因为怕她把笔都削完而夺走她的钢笔或铅笔时，每当我为了活跃气氛而打断她的辩解时，她就会抬起眼睛，以一种特殊的眼神瞥向我，说真话，那甜蜜快乐又带有挑战性的一瞥令我激动不已——从来没有什么能让我这样激动——并使我稀里糊涂地（幸亏她不知道这一点）即便不做她的奴隶，也甘愿臣服于她。在这些小事之后她的精神会很高涨，常常长达几个小时，而且正如我之前说过的，她的身体从此吸收了能量与活力，在她姑妈去世和她被解雇之前，这种能量与活力几乎使她的躯体获得了新生。","‘Well, well, ere long I shall pay you another visit, Good-evening now,’ and I left her rather abruptly.I had much ado to resist a strong inward impulse, urging me to take a warmer, a more expressive leave.What so natural as to fold her for a moment in a close embrace, to imprint one kiss on her cheek and forehead?I was not unreasonable; that was all I wanted.Satisfied in that point I could go away content.And Reason denied me even this.She ordered me to turn my eyes from her face and my steps from her apartment—to quit her as dryly and coldly as I would have quitted old Madame Pelet.I obeyed, but I swore rancorously to be avenged one day. I’ll earn a right to do as I please in this matter, or I’ll die in the contest.I have one object before me now—to get that Genevese girl for my wife; and my wife she shall be—that is, provided she has as much, or half as much, regard for her master as he has for her.And would she be so docile, so smiling, so happy under my instructions if she had not?Would she sit at my side, when I dictate or correct, with such a still, contented, halcyon mien? For I had ever remarked that, how- ever sad or harassed her countenance might be when I entered a room, yet after I had been near her, spoken to her a few words, given her some directions, uttered perhaps some reproofs, she would, all at once, nestle into a nook of happiness, and look up serene and revived.The reproofs suited her best of all.While I scolded she would chip away with her penknife at a pencil or a pen, fidgeting a little, pouting a little, defending herself by monosyllables; and when I deprived her of the pen or pencil, fearing it would be all cut away, and when I interdicted even the monosyllabic defence, for the purpose of working up the subdued excitement a little higher, she would at last raise her eyes and give me a certain glance, sweetened with gaiety, and pointed with defiance, which, to speak truth, thrilled me as nothing had ever done, and made me, in a fashion (though happily she did not know it), her subject, if not her slave.After such little scenes her spirits would maintain their flow, often for some hours, and, as, I remarked before, her health therefrom took a sustenance and vigour which, previously to the event of her aunt’s death and her dismissal, had almost recreated her whole frame."
"上面的几句话我是花了好几分钟才写出来的，但这一切都是我在从弗朗西斯房间出来下楼梯的短暂时间里想出的。就在我打开前门时，忽然想起我还没有还她那二十法郎。我停住了——我不可能再拿着那些钱，但是要强行把它们物归原主也很难。我现在已经见到了她那简陋的住所，目睹了她贫困中的傲骨，有序中的傲气，以及对于保守传统的讲究挑剔，更了解了她小家的布局与节俭。我确定，如果我还给她这学费，她会感到痛苦的。我确定她不会接受任何人的恩惠，尤其是从我的手中。然而这四枚五法郎硬币对我的自尊心也是一种负担，我必须摆脱。我忽然想出一个权宜之计——毫无疑问，这是个笨办法，但却是我能想到的最好的。我冲到楼上，敲了敲门，装作很急地又进了她的房间：“小姐，我忘了一只手套。肯定是落在这儿了。”","It has taken me several minutes to write these last sentences; but I had thought all their purport during the brief interval of descending the stairs from Frances‘ room.Just as I was opening the outer door I remembered the twenty francs which I had not restored.I paused—impossible to carry them away with me, difficult to force them back on their original owner.I had now seen her in her own humble abode, witnessed the dignity of her poverty, the pride of order, the fastidious care of conservatism, obvious in the arrangement and economy of her little home.I was sure she would not suffer herself to be excused paying her debts.I was certain the favour of indemnity would be accepted from no hand, perhaps least of all from mine.Yet these four five-franc pieces were a burden to my self- respect, and I must get rid of them.An expedient—a clumsy one no doubt, but the best I could devise—suggested itself to me.I darted up the stairs, knocked, re-entered the room as if in haste,—‘Mademoiselle, I have forgotten one of my gloves.I must have left it here.’"
"她立即起身去找。在她转身的时候，我正站在壁炉旁悄悄地拿起一只小花瓶，把钱偷偷地溜进下面。那是一套瓷器装饰品中的一只，和那些茶杯一样古老，然后说道，“啊，我的手套在这！它掉到炉子围栏里了。晚安了，小姐，”我再一次离开了。","She instantly rose to seek it.As she turned her, back, I—being now at the hearth—noiselessly lifted a little vase, one of a set of china ornaments, as old-fashioned as the tea-cups slipped the money under it, then saying, ‘Oh, here is my glove!I had dropped it within the fender.Good-evening, mademoiselle,’ I made my second exit."
"尽管这次即兴的回访很短，但却让我有时间去掉一块心病。我看到弗朗西斯已经将烧得发红的煤块从跳跃着的炉火夹了下来。迫于要计较每个铜板，才会在每处细节上省钱，所以我一离开她就熄了火，她认为一个人烧那么旺的火太奢侈了。","Brief as my impromptu return had been, it had afforded me time to pick up a heartache.I remarked that Frances had already removed the red embers of her cheerful little fire from the grate.Forced to calculate every item, to save in every detail, she had instantly on my departure retrenched a luxury too expensive, to be enjoyed alone."
"“还好不是冬天，”我暗想，“不过再过两个多月，十一月的风雨就要来袭了。如果在那之前我能有资格往那个炉子里上随意加煤该多好啊！”","‘I am glad it is not yet winter,’ thought I; ‘but in two months more come the winds and rains of November.Would to God that before then I could earn the right and the power to shovel coals into that grate ad libitum!’"
"人行道已经快干了，芬芳清新的微风在被闪电净化后的空气中飘拂。我背西而行，此时西边的天空就像块蓝色的蛋白石，湛蓝中夹杂着一丝深红。夕阳仿佛被拉长了，整个天边都染上了泰尔红紫色，瑰丽辉煌。我向东边走去，面对着朵朵白云，在我面前出现一道彩虹——一道完美的彩虹，又高又宽，十分鲜艳。我久久地看着，双眼迷醉在这美景下，思绪也沉浸其中了；那天晚上，我躺在床上兴奋得难以入睡，注视着窗外悄无声息的成片闪电，云层逐渐散去了，它们却仍然在其间嬉戏，在整个星海上空洒下银辉。最后，我睡着了，在梦中又见到了那轮落日，那排彩云，那道浩瀚的彩虹。我觉得似乎站在一个高坡上。背倚一道护墙。身下是一道深不可测的深渊，但因为能听见波浪不停的拍打声，我猜那是大海——大海一直延伸到天际，海水的颜色由淡绿过渡成深蓝，远处的一切都很柔和，都陷入雾霭之中。突然水天的交接处出现一道金光，那金光慢慢浮起，靠近，扩大，变化；那道金光悬在天地之间，彩虹之下，柔和而暗沉的云朵在它后面散开。它像长了翅膀一般翱翔着，如珍珠般美丽、羊毛般柔软并闪闪发亮的气流霓裳一般披在身上；肉红色的光芒仿佛为它勾勒出面孔与四肢：一颗更富光泽的大星星在一位天使的额头闪烁，抬起的手臂和手掌像是一道光束，直指头顶的彩虹，一个声音在我心中低语：“希望在朝着努力微笑！”","Already the pavement was drying; a balmy and fresh breeze stirred the air, purified by lightning.I felt the west behind me, where spread a sky like opal; azure immingled with crimson.The enlarged sun, glorious in Tyrian tints, dipped his brim already.Stepping, as I was, eastward, I faced a vast bank of clouds, but also I had before me the arch of an evening rainbow—a perfect rainbow, high, wide, vivid.I looked long; my eye drank in the scene, and I suppose my brain must have absorbed it; for that night, after lying awake in pleasant fever a long time, watching the silent sheet-lightning, which still played among the retreating clouds, and flashed silvery over the stars. I at last fell asleep; and then in a dream were reproduced the setting sun, the bank of clouds, the mighty rain- bow.I stood, methought, on a terrace.I leaned over a parapeted wall.there was space below me, depth I could not fathom; but hearing an endless dash of waves, I believed it to be the sea—sea spread to the horizon, sea of changeful green and intense blue; all was soft in the distance, all vapour-veiled.A spark of gold glistened on the line between water and air, floated up, approached, enlarged, changed; the object hung midway between heaven and earth under the arch of the rainbow; the soft but dusk clouds diffused behind.It hovered as on wings; pearly, fleecy, gleaming air streamed like raiment round it; light, tinted with carnation, coloured what seemed face and limbs; a large star shone with still lustre on an angel’s forehead; an upraised arm and hand, glancing like a ray, pointed to the bow overhead, and a voice in my heart whispered, ‘Hope smiles on effort!’"
"第二十章","CHAPTER XX"
"我所需要的是丰厚的待遇；丰厚的待遇就是我现在的目标，我下定决心要得到的东西，但是它从来没像现在这样离我如此遥远。随着八月的来临，学年结束了，已经考完试，派发完奖金了，学校的人都已离开，所有学院和寄宿学校的大门都关闭了，一直到十月初或者中旬才会再次打开。八月的最后一天即将来临，我的地位怎么样了呢？从上个季度初到现在我向前迈进一步了吗？刚好相反，我向后退了一步。因为放弃了在勒泰小姐学校的英语老师工作，我就自动减去了自己每年二十英镑的收入，这样年收入就从每年六十英镑降到四十英镑，即使这个数目现在也很不稳定。","A competency was what I wanted; a competency it was now my aim and resolve to secure, but never had I been farther from the mark.With August the school year (l’année scolaire) closed, the examinations concluded, the prizes were adjudged, the schools dispersed, the gates of all colleges, the doors of all pensionnats shut, not to be reopened till the beginning or middle of October.The last day of August was at hand, and what was my position?Had I advanced a step since the commencement of the past quarter?On the contrary, I had receded one. By renouncing my engagement as English master in Mdlle. Reuter’s establishment I had voluntarily cut off £20 from my yearly income; I had diminished my £60 per annum to £40, and even that sum I now held by a very precarious tenure."
"我已经有段时间没提过珀莱先生了。我想，那次月下散步是本故事中最后一次对这位绅士形象的显著描写了。事实上，自从那件事情之后我们之间交往的性质就有了变化。他还真不知道那个寂静的时刻，一轮毫无遮掩的皓月和一扇打开的格子窗已经向我暴露了他那自私的爱情和虚伪的友谊，所以他还像以前那么圆滑殷勤，但我已变得像一头豪猪一样浑身是刺，像一根带黑刺的短棍一样不屈不挠。对于他的逗趣我从来不笑，也一刻都不愿跟他多呆。他请我去他家客厅和他喝咖啡的邀请，无一不被我拒绝，而且拒绝得生硬坚决。过去他拿女校长打趣（现在也还是那么做），总会逗得我大乐，如今大不相同，我只会冷冷地静静听着。对我的冷漠行为，珀莱非常有耐心地忍受了很长一段时间。他甚至更加殷勤，但是当他发现对我礼貌到阿谀奉承的地步还是不能打动我、使我态度缓和时，他终于也改变了态度。轮到他对我冷淡了。他也不再邀请我，脸色变得多疑而阴沉。我从他眉宇间沉思困惑的样子看出，在不断的自我检查与比较之下，他还是急切地想尽力对所有事情得出一个解释性的结论。我想不久他就成功了，因为他并不缺乏洞察力，也许佐蕾德小姐也在帮助他解开这个难题。","It is some time since I made any reference to M. Pelet.The moonlight walk is, I think, the last incident recorded in this narrative where that gentleman cuts any conspicuous figure.The fact is, since that event a change had come over the spirit of our intercourse.He, indeed, ignorant that the still hour, a cloudless moon, and an open lattice had revealed to me the secret of his selfish love and false friendship, would have continued smooth and complaisant as ever; but I grew spiny as a porcupine and inflexible as a black- thorn cudgel.I never had a smile for his raillery, never a moment for his society.His invitations to take coffee with him in his parlour were invariably rejected, and very stiffly and sternly rejected too.His jesting allusions to the directress (which he still continued) were heard with a grim calm very different from the petulant pleasure they were formerly wont to excite.For a long time Pelet bore with my frigid demeanour very patiently.He even increased his attentions; but finding that even a cringing politeness failed to thaw or move me, he at last altered too.In his turn he cooled; his invitations ceased; his countenance became suspicious and overcast, and I read in the perplexed yet brooding aspect of his brow a constant examination and comparison of premises, and an anxious endeavour to draw thence some explanatory inference.Ere long, I fancy, he succeeded, for he was not without penetration; perhaps, too, Mdlle. Zoraïde might have aided him in the solution of the enigma."
"不论怎样，我不久就发现他那疑心重重的举动已经消失了；他干脆放弃了对我友好热情的伪装，换上一副沉默不语的正经样子，但仍小心翼翼，彬彬有礼。这就是我想要在他身上达到的目的，如此一来，我又重新感到相对自在了。我实在不喜欢我在他家的位置。但是既然摆脱了假情假意和口是心非给我带来的烦恼，我还是能够忍受的，尤其是校长对我的过分仇视和嫉妒并没有扰乱我达观的心绪。我发现他并没有刺伤我的敏感处，伤口很快便彻底愈合了，只剩下对他一贯奸诈嘴脸的蔑视，也永远不再信任那只我查明了企图暗中刺伤我的手。","At any rate, I soon found that the uncertainty of doubt had vanished from his manner; renouncing all pretence of friendship and cordiality, he adopted a reserved, formal, but still scrupulously polite deportment.This was the point to which I had wished to bring him, and I was now again comparatively at my ease.I did not, it is true, like my position in his house.But being freed from the annoyance of false professions and double-dealing I could endure it, especially as no heroic sentiment of hatred or jealousy of the director distracted my philosophical soul.He had not, I found, wounded me in a very tender point, the wound was so soon and so radically healed, leaving only a sense of contempt for the treacherous fashion in which it had been inflicted, and a lasting mistrust of the hand which I had detected attempting to stab in the dark."
"这种状态一直持续到七月中旬，然后发生了一点小变化。一天晚上珀莱比他以往晚回来一个小时，明显显得喝多了，这对他来说有点反常，因为如果他有着几样他的同胞们最坏的缺点，那至少他还保留着他们的一样美德——那就是，饮酒节制。然而这一次他却喝得烂醉如泥，他在大厅里疯狂地摇铃，惊动了整个学校（除了学生们，因为他们宿舍不在住宅楼，而在另一栋楼的教室上面，所以免受干扰），又叫仆人马上把午饭送过来——因为他以为当时是中午，实际上城市的午夜钟声刚刚敲过——他狂怒地斥责过仆人开饭不准时后，又跑去责骂他那可怜的老母亲；老太太劝他去睡觉，他却疯疯癫癫地大骂起“那个该死的英国人克里姆斯沃斯”来。当时我还没有睡觉，因为我手头有几本德语书，最近总是读到很晚。我听见楼下的骚动声，并辨出是校长在大喊大叫，声音异样而又十分骇人。我打开了一点门缝，听见他在叫人把“克里姆斯沃斯”给他带来，他要在大厅的桌子上割断他的喉咙，洗净他的人格。他断定克里姆斯沃斯的人格肮脏，带有可憎的英国血统。“他要不就是疯了，要不就是醉了，”我暗想，“无论哪种情况，那个老太太和仆人们都很需要一个男人的帮助。”于是我径直下楼来到大厅。我看见他步履蹒跚，眼珠快速地狂转着。他那半傻半疯的模样倒还挺有意思的。","This state of things continued till about the middle of July, and then there was a little change.Pelet came home one night, an hour after his usual time, in a state of unequivocal intoxication; a thing anomalous with him, for if he had some of the worst faults of his countrymen, he had also one at least of their virtues—that is, sobriety.So drunk, however, was he upon this occasion, that after having roused the whole establishment (except the pupils, whose dormitory, being over the classes in a building apart from the dwelling-house, was consequently out of the reach of disturbance) by violently ringing the hall bell and ordering lunch to be brought in immediately—for he imagined it was noon, whereas the city bells had just tolled midnight—after having furiously rated the servants for their want of punctuality, and gone near to chastise his poor old mother, who advised him to go to bed, he began raving dreadfully about ‘le maudit Anglais, Creemsvort.’ I had not yet retired; some German books I had got hold of had kept me up late.I heard the uproar below, and could distinguish the director’s voice exalted in a manner as appalling as it was unusual.Opening my door a little, I became aware of a demand on his part for ‘Creemsvort’ to be brought down to him, that he might cut his throat on the hall table and wash his honour, which he affirmed to be in a dirty condition, in infernal British blood.‘He is either mad or drunk,’ thought I, ‘and in either case the old woman and the servants will be the better of a man’s assistance;’ so I descended straight to the hall.I found him staggering about, his eyes in a fine frenzy rolling.A pretty sight he was—a just medium between the fool and the lunatic."
"“好了，珀莱先生，”我说道，“你还是去睡觉吧。”我抓住他的胳膊。他刚刚还在嚷嚷着要给我洗血，现在看见了我本人，又被我抓着，当然就更激动了。他挣扎着，对我愤怒地拳打脚踢。但是一个醉汉哪里打得过一个清醒的人；就算在正常状态下，珀莱那单薄的身躯也不可能与我健壮的体魄对抗。我将他扶上楼，又花了好长时间才把他弄上床。在这期间，他一直在嘟囔着一些话，尽管断断续续，但是有一定的含义；他骂我是一个背信弃义国家里的奸诈小人，同时又诅咒着佐蕾德·勒泰。他称她为“愚蠢的坏女人”，骂她是个水性杨花的烂货，堕落得一头钻进了无耻投机者的怀抱，最后那句“投机者”显然愤怒地将矛头间接转向了我。我把他放在床上安顿好，在这期间他不断地从床上弹起来；但直到我小心翼翼地用钥匙锁上他房间的门回到自己的房间，才确定他会在里面安安分分地睡到天亮，并能够不受影响地从刚刚目睹的情景中得出结论。","‘Come, M. Pelet,’ said I, ‘you had better go to bed,’ and I took hold of his arm. His excitement, of course, increased greatly at sight and touch of the individual for whose blood he had been making application.He struggled and struck with fury.But a drunken man is no match for a sober one; and, even in his normal state, Pelet’s worn-out frame could not have stood against my sound one.I got him upstairs, and, in process of time, to bed.During the operation he did not fail to utter comminations which, though broken, had a sense in them; while stigmatizing me as the treacherous spawn of a perfidious country, he in the same breath anathematized Zoraïde Reuter.He termed her ‘femme sotte et vicieuse,’ who, in a fit of lewd caprice, had thrown herself away on an unprincipled adventurer, directing the point of the last appellation by a furious blow, obliquely aimed at me.I left him in the act of bounding elastically out of the bed into which I had tucked him; but as I took the precaution of turning the key in the door behind me, I retired to my own room, assured of his safe custody till the morning, and free to draw undisturbed conclusions from the scene I had just witnessed."
"如今那位女校长正好被我的冷漠激怒，对我的轻蔑感到迷惑，又因怀疑我爱上另一个女人而深受刺激，此时她恰恰已经坠入她自己设置的圈套——她陷入了自己编织的情网，而她原本是想用那张网缠住我的。联想起那天在花园发生的事情，我从校长刚刚的表现可以推测出，他的情人泄露了她对他感情的疏远——或者我该说是意向的转移，感情这词在这里显得太过温情也太过纯洁——这使他发现她那空洞的心房中已没有了他，如今被他的职员占据着。当我发觉自己对此事有这样的想法时，不禁吃了一惊。珀莱拥有这样一所历史悠久的学校，是一位十分适宜又有利可图的佳偶——而佐蕾德是一个精于算计又很自私自利的女人——我很惊讶她心中纯粹的个人感情竟会在一时间压过世俗的利益。但是从珀莱所说的话中显然可以知道，她不但拒绝了他，还无意中说出了对我的偏爱。他的醉话里有一句是这样的，“那个女人看上了你的年轻，你这个没进化好的笨蛋，提到你那该死的英国礼节时还说你如贵族般风度翩翩，说你道德高尚——去你的吧！还说有卡顿那样的品质——笑话！”我想她的心态一定很古怪，尽管在那种心态之下她很自然地将财产和地位看得过重，但一个无财无权的下属对她的讽刺和轻蔑所产生的作用竟然远胜那位前途一片光明的校长的大肆奉承与殷勤。我暗暗地笑了笑；这也真是奇怪，尽管征服校长不合时宜地满足了我的自尊心，但我更美好的感情丝毫未被触动。次日，我见到了女校长，她借故和我在走廊上见了一面，她以一种如希洛人般谦卑的行为和表情想博得我的注意，可是我不能爱她，我甚至对她同情不起来。当她饶有兴趣地问及我的健康状况时，我所能做的只是简短而冷漠地回答几句，然后生硬地鞠了个躬离开。她那时的仪态和举止——在过去的很长一段时间也是这样——使我产生一种特别的印象。它们封锁了一切善的东西，引诱出我天性里一切恶的东西；有时它们能削弱我的感官，但却总是使我的心肠变得坚硬。我意识到它所造成的危害，内心也斗争过是否要改变。我素来痛恨专制之人；可是看，我也有了一个主动送上的奴隶，我本人也快要成为一个自己都憎恨的专制者了！在接受这位仍然年轻貌美的女崇拜者的赤裸裸地诱惑时，我心里有一种低贱的满足感，可就在享受这种乐趣时又有一种令人愤怒的堕落感。当她像个奴隶一样轻悄悄地走到我的身边，我立即会像个帕夏一样产生一种野蛮的肉欲。我有时忍受她的崇拜；有时又很排斥。我的冷淡和严肃却也同样地助长了我本想抑制的邪恶。","Now, it was precisely about this time that the directress, stung by my coldness, bewitched by my scorn, and excited by the preference she suspected me of cherishing for another, had fallen into a snare of her own laying—was herself caught in the meshes of the very passion with which she wished to entangle me.Conscious of the state of things in that quarter, I gathered, from the condition in which I saw my employer, that his ladylove had betrayed the alienation of her affections—inclinations, rather, I would say; affection is a word at once too warm and too pure for the subject—had let him see that the cavity of her hollow heart, emptied of his image, was now occupied by that of his usher.It was not without some surprise that I found myself obliged to entertain this view of the case.Pelet, with his old-established school, was so convenient, so profitable a match—Zoraïde was so calculating, so interested a woman—I wondered mere personal preference could, in her mind, have prevailed for a moment over worldly advantage.Yet it was evident from what Pelet said that not only had she repulsed him, but had even let slip expressions of partiality for me.One of his drunken exclamations was, ‘And the jade dotes on your youth, you raw blockhead, and talks of your noble deportment, as she calls your accursed English formality, and your pure morals, forsooth! des m¦urs de Caton a-t-elle dit—sotte!’Hers, I thought, must be a curious soul, where, in spite of a strong natural tendency to estimate unduly advantages of wealth and station, the sardonic disdain of a fortuneless subordinate had wrought a deeper impression than could he imprinted by the most flattering assiduities of a prosperous chef d’institution.I smiled inwardly; and, strange to say, though my amour propre was excited not disagreeably by the conquest, my better feelings remained untouched.Next day, when I saw the directress, and when she made an excuse to meet me in the corridor, and besought my notice by a demeanour and look subdued to Helot humility, I could not love, I could scarcely pity her.To answer briefly and dryly some interesting inquiry about my health, to pass her by with a stern bow, was all I could.Her presence and manner had then, and for some time previously and consequently, a singular effect upon me.They sealed up all that was good, elicited all that was noxious in my nature; sometimes they enervated my senses, but they always hardened my heart.I was aware of the detriment done, and quarrelled with myself for the change.I had ever hated a tyrant; and, behold, the possession of a slave, self-given, went near to transform me into what I abhorred!There was at once a sort of low gratification in receiving this luscious incense from an attractive and still young worshipper, and an irritating sense of degradation in the very experience of the pleasure.When she stole about me with the soft step of a slave, I felt at once barbarous and sensual as a pasha.I endured her homage sometimes; sometimes I rebuked it.My indifference or harshness served equally to increase the evil I desired to check."
"有一次我无意听到她对她的母亲说：“他是多么地高傲啊！他高傲地微笑时就像太阳神阿波罗一样漂亮。“","‘Que le lui sied bien!’ I once overheard her say to her mother.‘Il est beau comme Apollon quand il sourit de son air hautain.’"
"这位快乐的老夫人哈哈笑起来，说她觉得她的女儿着了魔；因为我除了品德端正、四肢健全之外，一点都不具备美男的特征。“在我看来，”她继续说道，“他戴上眼镜就像一只猫头鹰。”","And the jolly old dame laughed, and said she thought her daughter was bewitched; for I had no point of a handsome man about me, except being straight and without deformity.‘Pour moi,’ she continued, ‘il me fait tout l’effet d‘un chathuant, avec ses bésicles.’"
"多么可敬的老姑娘啊！如果她不是有点太老太胖、脸色又过于通红的话，我就会走过去亲亲她。与她女儿那病态的幻觉相比，她明智而真实的评价多么全面。","Worthy old girl!I could have gone and kissed her had she not been a little too old, too fat, and too red-faced.Her sensible, truthful words seemed so wholesome, contrasted with the morbid illusions of her daughter."
"发酒疯的次日早晨，珀莱醒来，已经记不得前一天晚上发生的事情了，所幸她的母亲很谨慎，没有跟他说我亲眼目睹他出尽的洋相。他没有再借酒浇愁，但即使是清醒的，他也很快表现出那嫉妒的铁块已坠入了他的心灵。他是一个彻头彻尾的法国人，在他性格的各种构成要素中，法兰西民族的凶残特点绝对少不了。这种特点在他酒后的愤怒行为中第一次展现出来的，当时他对我个人充满仇恨的威胁体现了他恶魔似的本性，如今这种本性表现得较为隐蔽些，在他看到我时脸部肌肉会短暂地收缩，而当他的浅蓝色眼睛与我的相遇时便会闪耀着凶猛的光芒。他彻底避开了同我讲话，现在连假客气也一并省了。对于眼下我们之间的关系，我已经很厌烦，有时候几乎到了不可控制的地步，不想住在这间房子里，为这样一个人卖力；但是谁能挣脱环境的束缚呢？在那个时候，我不能。每天早晨起床我都想摆脱他的束缚，恨不得夹着我的皮箱离开这里，即便是当一个乞丐，至少也是自由的；晚上，当我从小姐的寄宿学校回来，就有一个愉快的声音回荡在我的耳边，一张机敏而又温顺、沉思而又温和的面孔出现在我的眼前，一个骄傲而又顺从、敏感而又聪慧、严肃而又热情的身影出现在我的脑海，一种热烈而又谦卑、高贵而又踏实、纯洁而又有力的情感使我的回忆既愉快又伤感——我能建起新的关系，承担新的义务，这使我不想再漂泊，再反叛，而应该用斯巴达人那样的品德去宽恕我所记恨的那些人。","When Pelet awoke on the morning after his frenzy fit, he retained no recollection of what had happened the previous night, and his mother fortunately had the discretion to refrain from informing him that I had been a witness of his degradation.He did not again have recourse to wine for curing his griefs, but even in his sober mood he soon showed that the iron of jealousy had entered into his soul.A thorough Frenchman, the national characteristic of ferocity had not been omitted by nature in compounding the ingredients of his character.It had appeared first in his access of drunken wrath when some of his demonstrations of hatred to my person were of a truly fiendish character, and now it was more covertly betrayed by momentary contractions of the features, and flashes of fierceness in his light blue eyes when their glance chanced to encounter mine.He absolutely avoided speaking to me; I was now spared even the falsehood of his politeness.In this state of our mutual relations my soul rebelled, sometimes almost ungovernably, against living in the house and discharging the service of such a man; but who is free from the constraint of circumstances?At that time I was not.I used to rise each morning eager to shake off his yoke, and go out with my portmanteau under my arm, if a beggar, at least a freeman; and in the evening, when I came back from the pensionnat de demoiselles, a certain pleasant voice in my ear; a certain face, so intelligent yet so docile, so reflective yet so soft, in my eyes; a certain cast of character, at once proud and pliant, sensitive and sagacious, serious and ardent, in my head; a certain tone of feeling, fervid and modest, refined and practical, pure and powerful, delighting and troubling my memory—visions of new ties I longed to contract, of new duties I longed to undertake, had taken the rover and the rebel out of me, and had shown endurance of my hated lot in the light of a Spartan virtue."
"但是珀莱的愤怒已经平息，两个星期的时间足够它产生、发展，然后消亡。在那段时间隔壁学校解雇了一位讨厌的老师，同时我也下定决心追寻我的学生，由于女校长拒绝告诉我女学生的地址，我立刻辞掉了我在她学校的工作。我的最后一招似乎立即使得勒泰小姐恢复了理智。她的洞察力和判断力长期被蛊惑人的幻象误导着，当幻象消失时，它们立即又回到了正确的轨道。我所说的正确轨道并不意味着陡峭艰难的原则之路——她从来没踏上过那条路——而是常识的大路，在这条路上她最近偏离得很厉害。她在常识这条路上仔细搜寻着，终于发现并不遗余力地追求起她旧时的求婚者珀莱先生；不久她就征服了他。我不知道她用了什么手段去安慰、迷惑他，但是她的确成功缓和了他的愤怒，并蒙蔽了他的双眼，这一点不久就被珀莱仪表和态度上的变化所证明。她肯定使他相信我从前不是，现在也不是他的对手，因为两周来他针对我的狂怒以一种过分和平友好的方式结束了，其中还颇有一些沾沾自喜的成分，让我在感到恼怒之余，更觉可笑。珀莱的单身生活是以地道的法国方式度过的，即无视道德的约束，我想他的婚后生活肯定也会是非常法国式的。他经常向我吹嘘他的那些已婚的老朋友是多么地害怕他；我猜想现在他们不难以其人之道还治其人之身了。","But Pelet’s fury subsided; a fortnight sufficed for its rise, progress, and extinction.In that space of time the dismissal of the obnoxious teacher had been effected in the neighbouring house, and in the same interval I had declared my resolution to follow and find out my pupil, and upon my application for her address being refused I had summarily resigned my own post.This last act seemed at once to restore Mdlle. Reuter to her senses.Her sagacity, her judgment, so long misled by a fascinating delusion, struck again into the right track the moment that delusion vanished.By the right track I do not mean the steep and difficult path of principle—in that path she never trod—but the plain highway of common sense, from which she had of late widely diverged.When there she carefully sought, and having found, industriously pursued the trail of her old suitor, M. Pelet. She soon overtook him.What arts she employed to soothe and blind him I know not, but she succeeded both in allaying his wrath and hoodwinking his discernment, as was soon proved by the alteration in his mien and manner.She must have managed to convince him that I neither was nor ever had been a rival of his, for the fortnight of fury against me terminated in a fit of exceeding graciousness and amenity, not unmixed with a dash of exulting self-complacency, more ludicrous than irritating.Pelet’s bachelor life had been passed in proper French style with due disregard to moral restraint and I thought his married life promised to be very French also.He often boasted to me what a terror he had been to certain husbands of his acquaintance; I perceived it would not now be difficult to pay him back in his own coin."
"变化仍在继续。刚一放暑假我便注意到珀莱家里开始忙起一些重要的事情。粉刷匠、打磨匠、家具商都立即开始工作，到处谈论着“夫人的卧室”、“夫人的客厅”。我想那位老女人不可能一下子身价倍增，居然让她儿子孝心大发，专门为她装修起房间来；我和厨师、两个女仆以及管厨房的人断定将有一位年轻的新夫人将要入住这座漂亮的房子了。","The crisis drew on. No sooner had the holidays commenced than note of preparation for some momentous event sounded all through the premises of Pelet.Painters, polishers, and upholsterers were immediately set to work, and there was talk of ‘la chambre de madame,’ ‘le salon de madame.’ Not deeming it probable that the old duenna at present graced with that title in our house had inspired her son with such enthusiasm of filial piety as to induce him to fit up apartments expressly for her use, I concluded, in common with the cook, the two housemaids, and the kitchen-scullion, that a new and more juvenile madame was destined to be the tenant of these gay chambers."
"不久后，这件即将到来的大事便被正式公开了。再过一个星期，弗朗索瓦·珀莱校长先生将与佐蕾德·勒泰小姐喜结连理。校长先生亲自通知了我这件事，最后亲切地向我表示他希望我一如既往地继续做他最得力的助手和最信赖的朋友，还说要给我加工资，每年再加二十法郎。我谢过了他，当时没给他明确答复。他离开之后，我脱下衬衫穿上外套，向弗朗德尔门外走去，我走了很远，想以此来冷却我的血液，平静我的神经，好把凌乱的思想理出一个头绪。事实上，我刚刚所收到的根本就是解聘通知。我不能也不想对自己隐瞒这种想法，勒泰小姐现在已经注定会成为珀莱夫人，我继续住在这个即将属于她的房子里也不合适。现在她对我的态度既尊重又颇为得体，但是我知道她之前的感情并没有改变。如今感情被礼节压抑，被策略遮掩，但是时机一到一切都会化为乌有——诱惑可以让束缚战栗。","Presently official announcement of the coming event was put forth.In another week’s time M. François Pelet, directeur, and Mdlle. Zoraïde Reuter, directrice, were to be joined together in the bonds of matrimony.Monsieur, in person heralded the fact to me, terminating his communication by an obliging expression of his desire that I should continue, as heretofore, his ablest assistant and most trusted friend, and a proposition to raise my salary by an additional two hundred francs per annum.I thanked him, gave no conclusive answer at the time, and, when he had left me, threw off my blouse put on my coat, and set out on a long walk outside the Porte de Flandre, in order, as I thought, to cool my blood, calm my nerves, and shake my disarranged ideas into some order.In fact, I had just received what was virtually my dismissal.I could not conceal, I did not desire to conceal, from myself the conviction that, being now certain that Mdlle.Reuter was destined to become Madame Pelet, it would not do for me to remain a dependent dweller in the house which was soon to be hers.Her present demeanour towards me was deficient neither in dignity nor propriety; but I knew her former feeling was unchanged.Decorum now repressed, and policy masked it, but opportunity would be too strong for either of these—temptation would shiver their restraints."
"我不是教皇——我不能自诩绝无过失：简而言之，如果我继续住下去，很可能头三个月就会在没有戒心的珀莱的屋檐下上演一部活色生香的现实版法国现代小说。然而，法国现代小说无论从实践上还是理论上都不对我的胃口。尽管我的人生经验还有限，但我还是有幸目睹了身边一个有趣而浪漫的家庭背叛实例。这个实例没有被小说里的金色光晕萦绕，我看见它赤裸而真切地暴露着，十分可憎。我看到一个机关算尽、惯于行骗的人是多么堕落，也看到一个身体慢慢被邪恶的灵魂侵蚀掉是多么腐败。我曾因被迫长时间注视这种景象而感到十分痛苦；但我现在并不后悔，因为这种简单的回忆是抵制诱惑最有效的解毒剂。这种痛苦在我的理性上刻下了这样的信条：靠侵犯别人的权利而获得的不正当快乐是虚幻且有毒的，它的空虚会在当时使人失望，它的毒素会在日后使人痛苦，它的后果就是使人永世堕落。","I was no pope—I could not boast infallibility: in short, if I stayed, the probability was that in three months’ time a practical modern French novel would be in full process of concoction under the roof of the unsuspecting Pelet.Now, modern French novels are not to my taste, either practically or theoretically.Limited as had yet been my experience of life, I had once had the opportunity of contemplating, near at hand, an example of the results produced by a course of interesting and romantic domestic treachery.No golden halo of fiction was about this example; I saw it bare and real, and it was very loathsome.I saw a mind degraded by the practice of mean subterfuge, by the habit of perfidious deception, and a body depraved by the infectious influence of the vice-polluted soul.I had suffered much from the forced and prolonged view of this spectacle; those sufferings I did not now regret, for their simple recollection acted as a most wholesome antidote to temptation.They had inscribed on my reason the conviction that unlawful pleasure, trenching on another’s rights, is delusive and envenomed pleasure; its hollowness disappoints at the time, its poison cruelly tortures afterwards, its effects deprave for ever."
"从这一切我得出结论，那就是我必须离开珀莱家，而且立即离开。“但是，”谨慎告诉我，“你既不知道去哪也不知道怎么生存。”这时真爱之梦朝我走来。亨利小姐似乎是站在我这边，她的纤腰邀请我的手臂去拥抱，她的小手请求着我的大手去握住。我觉得她的手就是为了让我抓在手里而存在的；我既不能放弃我的权利，也永远不能避开她的眼神，在她眼里我看到了满满的幸福，看到了两心相印；我对她的表情有着很大的影响力，我能够在她体内燃起欢乐，灌注敬畏，搅动心底的愉悦，唤起闪光的灵魂，有时弄醒那令人愉快的恐惧。成功与富有的希望，工作与升迁的决心一个个站起来反对我，这里我几乎要坠入彻底贫困的深渊；“这一切，”我内心里一个声音说道，“都是因为你害怕一种可能根本不会发生的邪恶！”，“它会发生，你知道它会。”固执的良心回答说。“做你感觉是对的事吧。听我的话，即使陷入贫穷的泥潭中我也会让你站稳脚跟。”然后，当我快速地沿着这条路走时，内心里突然出现一个陌生的庞然大物，虽然看不见，但它是存在的。在它仁慈时，我只想到我的幸福安宁，但现在它却注视着我内心正与邪的斗争，等着看我是否会遵循它的话，听着我良心里的窃窃私语，或者偷听着我跟它共同的敌人——邪恶的幽灵——试图将我引上迷途。万能的理智给我暗示的是一条陡峭不平的上坡道，而下坡之路却长满青苔，沿着绿色的道路洒满了诱惑的鲜花；但是我想只要我鼓足勇气，勇敢地踏上崎岖的上坡道，那么身为万物之友的爱神将会极为满意地微笑；反过来说，一旦我踏上铺满天鹅绒的下坡，就会使得身为人神公敌的恶魔的眉角露出欣喜之情。我急忙转过身匆忙地往回跑；半个小时后我又回到了珀莱先生的家。在他的书房里我找到了他，简短的会谈、简单的解释便已足够，我的方式表明我已下定决心，也许他从心底里是赞同我的决定的。二十分钟的谈话后我又回到自己的房间，我就这样剥夺了自己的谋生手段，判决自己离开现在的家，简单地通知了他我会在一个星期之内找到地方搬走。","From all this resulted the conclusion that I must leave Pelet’s, and that instantly.‘But,’ said Prudence, ‘you know not where to go nor how to live.’ And then the dream of true love came over me.Frances Henri seemed to stand at my side, her slender waist to invite my arm, her hand to court my hand.I felt it was made to nestle in mine; I could not relinquish my right to it, nor could I withdraw my eyes for ever from hers, where I saw so much happiness, such a correspondence of heart with heart; over whose expression I had such influence; where I could kindle bliss, infuse awe, stir deep delight, rouse sparkling spirit, and sometimes waken pleasurable dread.My hopes to win and possess, my resolutions to work and rise rose in array against me; and here I was about to plunge into the gulf of absolute destitution; ‘and all this,’ suggested an inward voice, ‘because you fear an evil which may never happen!’ ‘It will happen; you know it will,’ answered that stubborn monitor Conscience.‘Do what you feel is right.Obey me, and even in the sloughs of want I will plant for you firm footing.’ And then, as I walked fast along the road there rose upon me a strange, inly-felt idea of some Great Being, unseen, but all-present, who in His beneficence desired only my welfare, and now watched the struggle of good and evil in my heart, and waited to see whether I should obey His voice, heard in the whispers of my conscience, or lend an ear to the sophisms by which His enemy and mine, the Spirit of Evil, sought to lead me astray.Rough and steep was the path indicated by divine suggestion, mossy and declining the green way along which temptation strewed flowers; but whereas, methought, the Deity of Love, the Friend of all that exists, would smile well pleased were I to gird up my loins and address myself to the rude ascent, so, on the other hand, each inclination to the velvet declivity seemed to kindle a gleam of triumph on the brow of the man- hating, God-defying demon.Sharp and short I turned round, fast I retraced my steps; in half an hour I was again at M. Pelet’s. I sought him in his study; brief parley, concise explanation sufficed; my manner proved that I was resolved; he, perhaps, at heart approved my decision.After twenty minutes’ conversation I re-entered my own room, self-deprived of the means of living, self-sentenced to leave my present home, with the short notice of a week in which to provide another."
"第二十一章","CHAPTER XXI"
"我刚关上门就看见桌子上摆了两封信。我先想到的是我某个学生的朋友寄过来的邀请信。我过去偶尔收到过这类邀请信，对于我这种没有朋友的人，根本不会有更为重要的信件。自我来到布鲁塞尔，邮差的到来从来就不关我的事。我毫不在意地将手放在信上，冷淡而缓慢地看着它们，准备撕信封。忽然我的眼睛和手都停住了，我明白是什么让我激动了，那就像是我本以为只是白纸一张，结果却看到了一副鲜艳的图画。一个信封上是英国邮戳，另一张上是一位女子清晰娟秀的笔迹。我先打开了后一封。","Directly as I closed the door I saw laid on the table two letters.My thought was that they were notes of invitation from the friends of some of my pupils.I had received such marks of attention occasionally, and with me, who had no friends, correspondence of more interest was out of the question.The postman’s arrival had never yet been an event of interest to me since I came to Brussels.I laid my hand carelessly on the documents, and coldly and slowly glancing at them, I prepared to break the seals.My eye was arrested and my hand too; I saw what excited me, as if I had found a vivid picture where I expected only to discover a blank page.On one cover was an English postmark; on the other a lady’s clear, fine autograph.The last I opened first."
"“先生，在您拜访我的第二天早晨我便发现您所做的事情了。您也许确定我每天都会给瓷器除尘，因为除了您之外，这周没有人来过我的房间，而且这种带有仙女图像的硬币在布鲁塞尔并不流通，我毫无疑问就断定是谁将这二十法郎放在壁炉台上的。我想起当我弯腰去桌子下帮您找手套的时候曾经听见您弄那个花瓶，我还想您怎么会把手套掉到那么小的杯子里呢。先生，既然这钱不是我的，我不能留着它。我没有将它们装到这个信封里寄给您，因为可能会丢——而且那也太重了——我会暂时收着，等到下次见到您再还给您。您一定要毫不客气地拿走它们，首先因为我确定先生您能够理解任何人都想还清他的债务——正所谓“无债一身轻”；其次我之所以能够真心诚意地将钱还给您是因为我已经找到一份工作。事实上，这也是我写信给您的真正原因，因为我很乐意给您报喜，这些日子里我唯能跟我的老师说一些事情。","’Monsieur,—I found out what you had done the very morning after your visit to me. You might be sure I should dust the china every day; and as no one but you had been in my room for a week, and as fairy-money is not current in Brussels, I could not doubt who left the twenty francs on the chimney-piece.I thought I heard you stir the vase when I was stooping to look for your glove under the table, and I wondered you should imagine it had got into such a little cup. Now, monsieur, the money is not mine, and I shall not keep it.I will not send it in this note, because it might be lost—besides, it is heavy—but I will restore it to you the first time I see you.And you must make no difficulties about taking it: because, in the first place, I am sure, monsieur, you can understand that one likes to pay one’s debts—that it is satisfactory to owe no man anything; and, in the second place, I can now very well afford to be honest, as I am provided with a situation.This last circumstance is, indeed, the reason of my writing to you, for it is pleasant to communicate good news and in these days I have only my master to whom I can tell anything."
"“先生，一周前一个叫沃顿太太的英国夫人派人叫我过去。她的大女儿要结婚，有一位富亲戚送给她一方面纱和一件镶着昂贵古花边的衣服，她们说那件衣服几乎像珍宝一样珍贵，但是因为年代久远而有一些损坏，她们请我去修一下。我只好在她家里修。此外她们还给了我一些刺绣活，我花了快一个星期才把一切弄好。在我工作的时候，沃顿小姐经常来房间里和我坐在一起，沃顿夫人也是一样。她们让我说英语，问我怎么学的，能讲那么好。然后她们问我还知道什么，读过什么书，不久她们似乎对我有了好奇心，认为我一定是个有学识的女工。一天下午沃顿太太带来一个巴黎夫人，想测试我的法语水平。可能很大程度上由于这对好脾气的母女人逢喜事，乐于行善，我想还部分地因为她们天性向善，所以她们认为我表达过想做一些比缝补花边更重要的事的愿望很理所当然。她们当天便带我坐马车到德太太家，德太太是布鲁塞尔第一所英语学校的女校长。好像她正好在找一个法国女士用法语教授地理、历史、语法和作文。沃顿太太很热情地推荐了我；由于她的两个小女儿在这所学校读书，她又是该校赞助人，这两点帮助我谋得了那个职位。最后确定我每天上六个小时的课（所幸的是没有要求我住在学校；要我离开家我会很难过的），沃顿太太每年付我一千两百法郎。","‘A week ago, monsieur, I was sent for by a Mrs. Wharton, an English lady.Her eldest daughter was going to be married, and some rich relation having made her a present of a veil and dress in costly old lace, as precious, they said, almost as jewels, but a little damaged by time, I was commissioned to put them in repair.I had to do it at the house.They gave me, besides some embroidery to complete, and nearly a week elapsed before I had finished everything.While I worked, Miss Wharton often came into the room and sat with me, and so did Mrs. Wharton.They made me talk English; asked how I had learned to speak it so well.Then they inquired what I knew besides—what books I had read; soon they seemed to make a sort of wonder of me, considering me no doubt as a learned grisette.One afternoon Mrs. Wharton brought in a Parisian lady to test the accuracy of my knowledge of French.The result of it was that, owing probably in a great degree to the mother’s and daughter’s good- humour about the marriage, which inclined them to do beneficent deeds, and partly, I think, because they are naturally benevolent people, they decided that the wish I had expressed to do something more than mend lace was a very legitimate one, and the same day they took me in their carriage to Mrs. D—’s, who is the directress of the first English school at Brussels.It seems she happened to be in want of a French lady to give lessons in geography, history, grammar, and composition, in the French language.Mrs. Wharton recommended me very warmly; and as two of her younger daughters are pupils in the house, her patronage availed to get me the place.It was settled that I am to attend six hours daily (for, happily, it was not required that I should live in the house; I should have been sorry to leave my lodgings), and for this Mrs. D— will give me twelve hundred francs per annum."
"“所以先生您看，我现在富起来了——几乎比我以前所希望的还富有。对此我很感激，尤其是我的视力开始由于长期做精细女工而受到损害，而且夜里经常熬夜到很晚，也弄得我非常厌倦，都没有时间读书学习。我开始担心这样迟早会生病，甚至无力支付日常开销。这种担心如今已经在很大程度上不存在了；说实在的，先生，我很感激上帝为我减轻了负担，我觉得很有必要向乐他人所乐的好心人诉说我心中的喜悦之情。于是我忍不住提笔给您写信。我和自己争辩，写这封信令我很开心，先生您读起来尽管可能会觉得很无聊，但也不至于痛苦。我拙词劣句地赘述了这么多，还请先生见谅，并请相信您忠实的学生。","‘You see, therefore, monsieur, that I am now rich—richer almost than I ever hoped to be.I feel thankful for it, especially as my sight was beginning to be injured by constant working at fine lace; and I was getting, too, very weary of sitting up late at nights, and yet not being able to find time for reading or study.I began to fear that I should fall ill, and be unable to pay my way. This fear is now in a great measure removed; and in truth, monsieur, I am very grateful to God for the relief, and I feel it necessary, almost, to speak of my happiness to some one who is kind-hearted enough to derive joy from seeing others joyful.I could not, therefore, resist the temptation of writing to you. I argued with myself it is very pleasant for me to write, and it will not be exactly painful, though it may be tiresome, to monsieur to read.Do not be too angry with my circumlocution and inelegancies of expression, and believe me your attached pupil,"
"弗·埃·亨利。”","F. E. Henri.’"
"读完这封信，我对里面的内容沉思了一会儿——心里究竟是伤感还是喜悦留到以后再说——跟着又拿起了第二封。那个笔迹我并不熟识——字体很小又很工整，既不像男人的字也不像女人的字。封条上是个盾形纹徽，我只能确定这不是西科姆家族的标志，这样我就知道这封信不会来自我几乎已经遗忘，当然也几乎遗忘我的贵族亲戚。那它到底是谁寄的呢？我打开信封，拆开叠着的信纸，信的内容如下：","Having read this letter, I mused on its contents for a few moments—whether with sentiments pleasurable or otherwise I will hereafter note—and then took up the other.It was directed in a hand to me unknown—small, and rather neat, neither masculine nor exactly feminine.The seal bore a coat of arms, concerning which I could only decipher that it was not that of the Seacombe family; consequently the epistle could be from none of my almost forgotten, and certainly quite forgetting, patrician relations.From whom, then, was it?I removed the envelope; the note folded within ran as follows:—"
"“我肯定你在那块法兰德斯的沃土上混得不错，你极有可能在富得流油的土地上过着奢侈的生活，就像一个坐在埃及人肉锅边上的黑头发、黄褐色皮肤、长鼻子的以色列人，或者就像利未那卑劣的儿子坐在神殿的大铜锅旁，时不时放进一个圣钩，从肉汤中捞出最肥的膀子和肉最多的前肋。因为你从没有给英国的任何人写过信，所以我知道这些。你真是条忘恩负义的狗啊！全赖我的鼎力推荐，你方能得到今天的位置，过着此般安逸的日子，而你却没有一句感激之言，甚至没听你说过一句谢谢来回赠我。但是我还是要去看你的，你那混乱的贵族头脑很难想象我是多么气愤，我已经将这种怨恨收到我的旅行箱里，准备带到布鲁塞尔去，一见你面就拿出来让你瞧瞧。","‘I have no doubt in the world that you are doing well in that greasy Flanders; living probably on the fat of the unctuous land; sitting like a black-haired, tawny-skinned, long-nosed Israelite by the flesh-pots of Egypt; or like a rascally son of Levi near the brass cauldrons of the sanctuary, and every now and then plunging in a consecrated hook, and drawing out of the sea of broth the fattest heave-shoulders and the fleshiest of wave-breasts.I know this, because you never write to any one in England.Thankless dog that you are!I, by the sovereign efficacy of my recommendation, got you the place where you are now living in clover, and yet not a word of gratitude, or even acknowledgment, have you ever offered in return.But I am coming to see you, and small conception can you, with your addled aristocratic brains, form of the sort of moral kicking I have ready packed in my carpet bag, destined to be presented to you immediately on my arrival."
"“同时我还知道你所有的事情，并且刚从布朗先生的上封信里得到消息，据说你即将和一位矮小肥胖的比利时女校长——叫佐诺比小姐还是什么的——喜结连理。我去你那儿的时候一定要见一见她！我可以向你保证——如果她合我的胃口，或者从经济的角度我觉得她很合适的话，我会向你猛扑过去，就算扳开你的牙齿也要成功地抢走她。但是我不喜欢矮胖型的，布朗说她就是又矮又胖——这正好适合你这种又瘦又长饿死鬼般的家伙。","’Meantime I know all about your affairs, and have just got information, by Brown’s last letter, that you are said to be on the point of forming an advantageous match with a pursy little Belgian schoolmistress—a Mdlle. Zoraïbe, or some such name.Won’t I have a look at her when I come over!And this you may rely on—if she pleases my taste, or if I think it worth while in a pecuniary point of view, I’ll pounce on your prize and bear her away triumphant in spite of your teeth.Yet I don’t like dumpies either, and Brown says she is little and stout—the better fitted for a wiry, starved-looking chap like you."
"“注意这点，你不会知道你的——（我不想亵渎神明，所以用了一个破折号来代表我要说的那个词）何日何时会到。——你忠实的，","‘Be on the lookout, for you know neither the day nor hour when your (I don’t wish to blaspheme, so I’ll leave a blank) cometh.—Yours truly,"
"亨斯登·约克·亨斯登。","Hunsden Yorke Hunsden."
"我“哼”了一声，放下信之前我又看了眼那细小而工整的字迹，一点都不像是出于一个商人之手，也确实不像除了亨斯登之外的任何人之手。人们说字如其人，那这封信与它主人的性格有什么相同之处呢？我回忆起写信者那古怪的面孔和一些我所猜测而非我所了解的特征，便自己答道：“真是极为相像。”","‘Humph!’ said I; and ere I laid the letter down I again glanced at the small, neat handwriting, not a bit like that of a mercantile man, nor, indeed, of any man except Hunsden himself.They talk of affinities between the autograph and the character; what affinity was there here?I recalled the writer’s peculiar face, and certain traits I suspected, rather than knew, to appertain to his nature, and I answered, ‘A great deal.’"
"那么亨斯登很快就要到布鲁塞尔了，我也不知道何时会到，他来是想看到我意气风发，即将娶得娇妻，步入温暖的巢窝，十分舒服地躺在一个温暖肥胖的小女人身边。","Hunsden, then, was coming to Brussels, and coming I knew not when—coming charged with the expectation of finding me on the summit of prosperity, about to be married, to step into a warm nest, to lie comfortably down by the side of a snug, well-fed little mate."
"“我倒希望能满足他，让他看到他所想象的场景，”我暗想，“但当看到的不是在玫瑰花丛里卿卿我我的一对肥斑鸠，而是一只孤孤单单无依无靠，站在荒凉的贫困悬崖边上的瘦鸬鹚，他会作何感想？哦，去他的吧！让他来吧，让他看着谣言和现实之间的差距来嘲笑我吧。如果他自己就是魔鬼，而不是我所想象的那个他，我就不用屈尊远离他了，也不会对他的讽刺挖苦付诸一笑，故作乐观。","‘I wish him joy of the fidelity of the picture he has painted,’ thought I.‘What will he say when, instead of a pair of plump turtle-doves, billing and cooing in a bower of roses, he finds a single lean cormorant, standing mateless and shelterless on poverty’s bleak cliff?Oh, confound him!Let him come, and let him laugh at the contrast between rumour and fact.Were he the devil himself, instead of being merely very like him I’d not condescend to get out of his way, or to forge a smile or a cheerful word wherewith to avert his sarcasm.’"
"然后我又想起之前那封信。它像一根奏响的琴弦，即使我用指头塞住耳朵也能听见那声音，因为它搅动着我的内心，虽然它的攀升很像优雅的音乐，可它的降落却像是在呻吟。","Then I recurred to the other letter.That struck a chord whose sound I could not deaden by thrusting my fingers into my ears, for it vibrated within; and though its swell might be exquisite music, its cadence was a groan."
"弗朗西斯摆脱了贫困的压力，告别了过分繁重的工作，这使我很高兴；她在得意时第一刻想到与我分享她的快乐，这满足了我内心的愿望。前两次读她的来信就好像两杯琼浆一样甘甜，但是当我将嘴唇靠近杯子喝第三次时，它却如醋和胆汁般又酸又苦。","That Frances was relieved from the pressure of want, that the curse of excessive labour was taken off her, filled me with happiness; that her first thought in prosperity should be to augment her joy by sharing it with me met and satisfied the wish of my heart.Two results of her letter were then pleasant sweet as two draughts of nectar; but applying my lips for the third time to the cup, and they were excoriated as with vinegar and gall."
"同样的收入在伦敦几乎不足以维持一个人的体面生活，但是在布鲁塞尔却足以让两个生活节制的人过得很好。这并不是因为伦敦的生活必需品价格或者税收比布鲁塞尔高很多，而是因为英国人比世界上其他民族的人愚蠢得多，他们屈从于习惯风俗，顾及外界的风言风语，渴望保持体面的形象，这比意大利人对牧师的尊敬、俄国人对沙皇崇拜、法国人对虚荣的追求以及德国人对黑啤的依赖都更强烈。我见过一个比利时家庭，那朴素大方的布置足以使一百个上流社会的英国宅邸中优雅冗余而奢华的装饰相形见绌。在比利时，只要你能赚钱你就能存钱。这在英国几乎不可能；英国人为了虚荣可以在一个月之内挥霍掉一年所赚的钱。更为可耻的是，在那个既富裕又贫穷的国家，所有人不分阶级都卑躬屈膝地追赶潮流。关于这个话题我能写一两章，但我必须克制，至少现在要克制。如果我保持以前每年六十英镑的收入，而如今弗朗西斯每年大概也有五十英镑，今晚我就可以直奔她家，向她说出我一直压抑着的话——那些话一直在我心里燃烧，使我烦躁不安。由于在我们生活的国家，节约并不被看做吝啬，衣食住行等方面的节俭并不等同于粗俗，所以只要我们合理安排，我们的收入加在一起足以维持我们共同的生活。但是一个无家可归又失去经济来源，而且毫无依靠的穷教师，是断不该有此想法的；他心里不该有爱情，嘴里也不该说出“结婚”二字。现在我第一次真切地明白贫穷的含义；我所作出的切断经济来源的牺牲，此刻看起来竟是另一种结果。这并不是一个正确、合适并体面的决定，反而似乎是一种轻率荒唐的行为。我在房间里走来走去，悔恨的痛苦不断扎着我。我从墙边走到窗边，足足走了有一刻钟，当我面对窗户时，有一种自责感，面对墙壁时又有一种自卑感。突然良心喊道：","Two persons whose desires are moderate may live well enough in Brussels on an income which would scarcely afford a respectable maintenance for one in London, and that not because the necessaries of life are so much dearer in the latter capital, or taxes so much higher than in the former, but because the English surpass in folly all the nations on God’s earth, and are more abject slaves to custom, to opinion, to the desire to keep up a certain appearance, than the Italians are to priestcraft, the French to vainglory, the Russians to their czar or the Germans to black beer.I have seen a degree of sense in the modest arrangement of one homely Belgian household that might put to shame the elegance, the superfluities, the luxuries, the strained refinements of a hundred genteel English mansions.In Belgium, provided you can make money, you may save it.This is scarcely possible in England; ostentation there lavishes in a month what industry has earned in a year.More shame to all classes in that most bountiful and beggarly country for their servile following of fashion.I could write a chapter or two on this subject, but must forbear, at least for the present.Had I retained my £60 per annum, I could, now that Frances was in possession of £50, have gone straight to her this very evening and spoken out the words which, repressed, kept fretting my heart with fever.Our united income would, as we should have managed it, have sufficed well for our mutual support, since we lived in a country where economy was not confounded with meanness, where frugality in dress, food, and furniture was not synonymous with vulgarity in these various points.But the placeless usher, bare of resource, and unsupported by connections, must not think of this; such a sentiment as love, such a word as marriage, were misplaced in his heart and on his lips.Now for the first time did I truly feel what it was to be poor; now did the sacrifice I had made in casting from me the means of living put on a new aspect.Instead of a correct, just, honourable act, it seemed a deed at once light and fanatical.I took several turns in my room, under the goading influence of most poignant remorse.I walked a quarter of an hour from the wall to the window; and at the window self-reproach seemed to face, me, at the wall self-disdain.All at once out spoke Conscience."
"“趴下，你这个让人痛苦的蠢货！”她喊道，“这个人已经尽了他的职责。你不应该再用各种幻想引诱他。他放弃了一些暂时的有可能的好处，避免了一场长久而必然的不幸，他干得很好。现在让他好好想想，当你蒙蔽双眼的尘土和震耳欲聋的噪声退去之后，他就会找到一条出路的。”","‘Down, stupid tormentors!’ cried she.‘The man has done his duty.You shall not bait him thus by thoughts of what might have been.He relinquished a temporary and contingent good to avoid a permanent and certain evil; he did well.Let him reflect now, and when your blinding dust and deafening hum subside he will discover a path.’"
"我坐下来，双手托着头，苦苦思考了一个小时——两个小时——还是徒劳无功。我似乎是在一个隐蔽的地窖里，凝视着四下的黑暗，因为周围是一码厚的石墙，头顶是层层的建筑，我盼望着光线能够穿透花岗岩，穿透如花岗岩般结实的水泥。但即使是最结实的建筑也会有或可能有裂缝。我这个如同洞穴般的小房间里就有，因为我终于看到，或者说似乎看到有一束光——那束光虽然暗淡、冰凉、可疑，但它毕竟是一束光，因为它照出了一条我的良心所认定的狭窄小径。在两三个小时的苦思冥想之后，我发掘了一些残余的情况，把这些情况拼凑起来也许有希望构成一个权宜之计，找到一些线索。情况大致如下：","I sat down; I propped my forehead on both my hands; I thought and thought an hour—two hours—vainly.I seemed like one sealed in a subterranean vault, who gazes at utter blackness, at blackness ensured by yard-thick stone walls around, and by piles of building above expecting light to penetrate through granite, and through cement firm as granite.But there are chinks, or there may be chinks, in the best-adjusted masonry.There was a chink in my cavernous cell, for eventually I saw, or seemed to see, a ray—pallid, indeed, and cold, and doubtful, but still a ray, for it showed that narrow path which conscience had promised.After two, three hours’ torturing research in brain and memory, I disinterred certain remains of circumstances, and conceived a hope that by putting them together an expedient might be framed and a resource discovered.The circumstances were briefly these:—"
"大概三个月前珀莱先生在生日之际设宴款待了他的学生们，那次宴会是在布鲁塞尔郊外一个人们常去郊游的地方举行的，现在我不太记得它的名字，只记得那附近有很多叫做池塘的小湖泊；有一个池塘比其他的都要大，节假日时人们总是喜欢在里面乘小船游玩。学生们已经吃了一大份薄脆松饼，又喝了几瓶卢汶啤酒，坐在一个专为他们这种酒足饭饱的人修建的花园里乘凉，恳请校长让他们去池塘里划船。大概六个年龄较大的学生成功地得到了准假，我被派去监护他们。在这六个学生中恰巧有一个叫吉恩·巴普蒂斯特·范登赫顿的最笨重的佛兰芒青年，他个子不高，虽然当时只有十六岁，却已是虎背熊腰，典型的一副法国人身材。又碰巧吉恩是第一个上船的。他摇摇晃晃，滚向一侧；船经不住他的体重，一下子就翻了。范登赫顿像铅块一样沉了又浮，浮了又沉。我立马脱下外套和背心。我从小在伊顿长大，在那漫长的十年中我划船、洗澡、游泳，水性极佳，对我来说跳入水中救人是件自然而简单的事情。小伙子和船夫们大叫起来，他们认为现在不是溺死一个而是要淹死一双了。当吉恩第三次浮起来时我抓住他的一只胳膊和衣领，三分多钟后我们两个就都安全上岸了。说实话，这件事实在是微不足道，因为我没有冒任何风险，虽然衣服湿了，但是后来甚至都没有感冒。可是吉恩·巴普蒂斯特是范登赫顿夫妻的独生子，他们听说了我的英勇事迹后，似乎就认为我展示出的英勇与奉献精神是无论怎么感谢都无以回报的。尤其是那位太太，她确信我肯定非常爱他们的宝贝儿子，否则我断然不会如此舍命相救；那位先生看起来十分老实，表情平淡，话说得很少，但也是直到我答应日后一旦需要帮助就回来麻烦他，给他一个报答我的机会，他才肯放我离开他家。当时我说那些话只是一道微弱的光线，而此时这却是我的唯一出路；事实上，这冰冷的光线虽然已燃起，却并没有使我高兴，似乎那条路也不是我愿意走的。我没有权利要求范登赫顿先生帮助我。我并没有做出什么能让他回报的丰功伟绩，没有，我只是迫不得已。我没有工作，我想找到工作。我能找到工作的最好机会就是寻求他的推荐。我知道只要我提出来他就会推荐我；但是我不想提出来，因为这样做会伤及我的自尊，有悖我的习惯，我觉得那样做是一种错误的放纵和懒惰的挑剔。不那样做，我也许会后悔一辈子。但我不会为此感到愧疚。","Some three months ago M. Pelet had, on the occasion of his fete, given the boys a treat, which treat consisted in a party of pleasure to a certain place of public resort in the outskirts of Brussels, of which I do not at this moment remember the name, but near it were several of those lakelets called etangs; and there was one etang, larger than the rest, where on holidays people were accustomed to amuse themselves by rowing round it in little boats.The boys having eaten an unlimited quantity of gaufres, and drunk several bottles of Louvain beer amid the shades of a garden made and provided for such crams, petitioned the director for leave to take a row on the etang.Half a dozen of the eldest succeeded in obtaining leave, and I was commissioned to accompany them as surveillant.Among the half- dozen happened to be a certain Jean Baptiste Vandenhuten, a most ponderous young Flamand, not tall, but even now, at the early age of sixteen, possessing a breadth and depth of personal development truly national.It chanced that Jean was the first lad to step into the boat.He stumbled, rolled to one side; the boat revolted at his weight, and capsized.Vandenhuten sank like lead, rose, sank again.My coat and waistcoat were off in an instant.I had not been brought up at Eton and boated and bathed and swum there ten long years for nothing; it was a natural and easy act for me to leap to the rescue.The lads and the boatmen yelled; they thought there would be two deaths by drowning instead of one.But as Jean rose the third time I clutched him by one leg and the collar, and in three minutes more both he and I were safe landed.To speak heaven’s truth, my merit in the action was small indeed, for I had run no risk, and subsequently did not even catch cold from the wetting; but when M.and Madame Vandenhuten, of whom Jean Baptiste was the sole hope, came to hear of the exploit, they seemed to think I had evinced a bravery and devotion which no thanks could sufficiently repay.Madame, in particular, was ‘certain I must have dearly loved their sweet son, or I would not thus have hazarded my own life to save his.’ Monsieur, an honest-looking though phlegmatic man, said very little; but he would not suffer me to leave the room till I had promised that in case I ever stood in need of help I would, by applying to him, give him a chance of discharging the obligation under which he affirmed I had laid him.These words, then, were my glimmer of light; it was here I found my sole outlet; and in truth, though the cold light roused, it did not cheer me, nor did the outlet seem such as I should like to pass through.Right I had none to M. Vandenhuten’s good offices.It was not on the ground of merit I could apply to him; no, I must stand on that of necessity.I had no work; I wanted work.My best chance of obtaining it lay in securing his recommendation.This I knew could be had by asking for it; not to ask because the request revolted my pride and contradicted my habits would, I felt, be an indulgence of false and indolent fastidiousness.I might repent the omission all my life.I would not, then, be guilty of it."
"那天晚上我来到范登赫顿家，但是我又是拉弓又是调箭却是一场空；因为弓弦断了。我按了大门的门铃（这是城市繁华地带上的一座高大富丽的房子），一位男仆人开了门，我求见范登赫顿先生，但是范登赫顿先生全家都不在城里——他们去奥斯坦德了——也不知道什么时候回来。我留下名片，便往回走了。","That evening I went to M. Vandenhuten’s, but I had bent the bow and adjusted the shaft in vain; the string broke.I rang the bell at the great door (it was a large, handsome house in an expensive part of the town); a manservant opened; I asked for M. Vandenhuten. M. Vandenhuten and family were all out of town—gone to Ostend—did not know when they would be back.I left my card, and retraced my steps."
"第二十二章","CHAPTER XXII"
"一个星期过去了，婚期到来了；婚礼在圣雅克教堂隆重举行；佐蕾德小姐变成了珀莱夫人，勒泰氏，这一转变发生大概一个小时之后，正如报纸所说，“那幸福的一对”按照之前的计划踏上了赴往巴黎的行程，他们要在那度蜜月。第二天我搬离了珀莱家。很快我便连人带物（一些书和衣服）搬到我租在不远处一条街上的简陋的房子里。不到半个小时我便把衣服收到了柜子里，把书摆在书架上，“迁徙大业”至此结束。我那天本无烦心之事，但是有一种剧痛折磨着我——我渴望到内日河畔的圣母大街去，但我克制着，心里已经下决心，在前途未卜的阴云散去之前避开那条街；但是我仍很烦躁。","A week is gone; le jour des noces arrived; the marriage was solemnized at St. Jacques; Mdlle. Zoraïde became Madame Pelet, née Reuter; and in about an hour after this transformation ‘the happy pair,’ as newspapers phrase it, were on their way to Paris, where, according to previous arrangement, the honeymoon was to be spent. The next day I quitted the pensionnat.Myself and my chattels (some books and clothes) were soon transferred to a modest lodging I had hired in a street not far off. In half an hour my clothes were arranged in a commode, my books on a shelf, and the ‘flitting’ was effected.I should not have been unhappy that day had not one pang tortured me—a longing to go to the Rue Notre Dame aux Neiges, resisted, yet irritated by an inward resolve to avoid that street till such time as the mist of doubt should clear from my prospects."
"那是一个甜蜜的九月份的夜晚——很暖和，很恬静。我没事可做。我知道此时弗朗西斯也已下班回家。我想她也许正想着见到她的老师呢。我知道我也很想见我的学生。想象力开始对我窃窃私语，对我的灵魂讲述着有可能发生的温馨的故事。","It was a sweet September evening—very mild, very still.I had nothing to do. At that hour I knew Frances would be equally released from occupation.I thought she might possibly be wishing for her master.I knew I wished for my pupil.Imagination began with her low whispers, infusing into my soul the soft tale of pleasures that might be."
"“你会发现她在读书或者写字，”她说，“你可以在她旁边坐下，无需让过分的激动来扰乱她的平静，也无需让不同寻常的行为或者话语来使她局促不安。而是像一如往常，俯身看她写了什么，侧耳倾听她读书，训斥她，或者无声地表示赞许。你知道这两种方法分别会有什么效果；你了解她高兴时的微笑，了解她激动时的面部表情；你有秘诀能在她的脸上唤起你想要的表情，你也能在她各种令人愉快的表情中选择。如果你在身边她就能够安静地坐着，无论你自顾自说多久都行；你可以用有力的咒语将吸引她。尽管她很聪明，又能言善辩，但是你能封住她的嘴巴，使她不得不害羞地掩饰住开心的表情。但是，你知道，她并不总是那么温柔；你曾见过她脸上出现过的奇怪的开心、反叛、鄙视、严厉、以及痛苦的表情；她的感情和面容都表现出充分的自信。你知道很少有人能像你那样制服她，你知道她宁愿牺牲也绝不向专政和不公低头，但是理智和情感只要稍作示意就可支配她。现在试试它们的影响力吧。去吧——它们不是激情；你可以安全地驾驭它们。”","‘You will find her reading or writing,’ said she; ‘you can take your seat at her side; you need not startle her peace by undue excitement; you need not embarrass her manner by unusual action or language.Be as you always are; look over what she has written; listen while she reads; chide her, or quietly approve.You know the effect of either system; you know her smile when pleased; you know the play of her looks when roused; you have the secret of awakening what expression you will, and you can choose amongst that pleasant variety.With you she will sit silent as long as it suits you to talk alone; you can hold her under a potent spell.Intelligent as she is, eloquent as she can be, you can seal her lips, and veil her bright countenance with diffidence.Yet, you know, she is not all monotonous mildness; you have seen, with a sort of strange pleasure, revolt, scorn, austerity, bitterness, lay energetic claim to a place in her feelings and physiognomy；you know that few could rule her as you do; you know she might break but never bend under the hand of Tyranny and Injustice but Reason and Affection can guide her by a sign.Try their influence now. Go—they are not passions; you may handle them safely.’"
"“我不会去的。”我对那位引诱我的甜美妖妇回答说道。“一个人在某种限度内是自己的主人，但超越这个限度就不是了。”我能去找弗朗西斯吗？能和她单独坐在安静的房间里，只用理智和情感的语言与她交谈吗？","‘I will not go,’ was my answer to the sweet temptress.‘A man is master of himself to a certain point, but not beyond it. Could I seek Frances to-night, could I sit with her alone in a quiet room, and address her only in the language of reason and affection?’"
"“不能。”那位征服我，且此刻控制着我的爱神简短而炽烈地回答道。","‘No,’ was the brief, fervent reply of that love which had conquered and now controlled me."
"时间似乎停止了，太阳不愿意下山去；我的表滴答作响，但我以为指针已经停了。","Time seemed to stagnate; the sun would not go down; my watch ticked, but I thought the hands were paralysed."
"“好热的夜晚哪！”我喊道，推开了格子窗；的确，我很少这样狂躁。听见有上公共楼梯的脚步声，我以为是一个房客正在回自己的房间，他可能如我一样心神不宁，无依无靠，也可能他的生活风平浪静，衣食无忧，自由自在，没有感情的羁绊。什么！难道我那无声的心思刚刚提出问题，他就亲自过来解决？他确实敲门了——敲了我的门——果断而急促；我还没邀请他就跨过门槛，然后随手关上房门。","‘What a hot evening!’ I cried, throwing open the lattice for, indeed, I had seldom felt so feverish.Hearing a step ascending the common stair, I wondered whether the locataire, now mounting to his apartments, were as unsettled in mind and condition as I was, or whether he lived in the calm of certain resources and in the freedom of unfettered feelings.What! was he coming in person to solve the problem hardly proposed in inaudible thought?He had actually knocked at the door—at my door—a smart, prompt rap; and almost before I could invite him in he was over the threshold, and had closed the door behind him."
"“你好吗？”只听有个人用英语冷漠平静地问道，而我的客人既没有寒暄半句也没有通报姓名，便把帽子放在桌上，把手套放入帽子里，向前拉了拉房间里唯一的一把安乐椅，静静地坐了进去。","‘And how are you?’ asked an indifferent, quiet voice, in the English language, while my visitor, without any sort of bustle or introduction, put his hat on the table and his gloves into his hat, and drawing the only armchair the room afforded a little forward, seated himself tranquilly therein."
"“你不会说话吗？”过了一会儿他问道，语气中的漠不关心似乎暗示我回答与否都没有什么两样。事实上，我现在很需要我的好朋友——眼镜——的帮助，并不是想完全确定我的客人是谁——因为我认识他，看他那厚颜无耻的样子！——但是我想看看他的样子，想看清他的神态和表情。我很小心地擦了擦眼镜，又同样小心翼翼地戴上，调了一下位置以免碰到鼻梁或者缠住我的褐色短发。我坐在靠窗的座位上，背向着光，正好跟他面对面——他肯定很想和我换位置，因为不论何时他都更喜欢观察别人而不是被别人观察。是的，来人就是他，没错，他那六英尺高的身躯坐在椅子上，身着天鹅绒衣领的深色旅行大衣，一条灰色的裤子，还有黑色领圈，他的脸是大自然所创造出的最新颖的脸，但这种新颖却最不易引人注意——没有哪个五官称得上特别或者奇特，但是总体效果却非同一般。试图描述不可描述的东西毫无用处。我并不急着和他说话，便安然地坐在那里瞪着眼睛。","‘Can’t you speak?’ he inquired in a few moments, in a tone whose nonchalance seemed to intimate that it was much the same thing whether I answered or not.The fact is, I found it desirable to have recourse to my good friends les bésicles, not exactly to ascertain the identity of my visitor—for I already knew him, confound his impudence!—but to see how he looked, to get a clear notion of his mien and countenance.I wiped the glasses very deliberately, and put them on quite as deliberately, adjusting them so as not to hurt the bridge of my nose or get entangled in my short tufts of dun hair.I was sitting in the window-seat, with my back to the light, and I had him vis-Evis—a position he would much rather have had reversed, for at any time he preferred scrutinizing to being scrutinized.Yes, it was he, and no mistake, with his six feet of length arranged in a sitting attitude, with his dark travelling surtout with its velvet collar, his gray pantaloons, his black stock, and his face, the most original one Nature ever modelled, yet the least obtrusively so—not one feature that could be termed marked or odd, yet the effect of the whole unique.There is no use in attempting to describe what is indescribable.Being in no hurry to address him, I sat and stared at my ease."
"“哦，你是要跟我比赛，是吗？”最后他说道，“好的，我们来看看谁先开口。”说着他慢慢地拿出一个精美的香烟盒，抽出一根烟放入嘴里，点燃，又从手边的书架上抽出本书，然后靠到椅子上，继续安安静静地抽烟看书，似乎他是在英国Ｘ镇格罗夫大街他自己的房间里。我知道他只要想出这个古怪的想法，就能这个样子坚持到半夜；于是我站了起来，从他手里拿过书，说道，——","‘Oh, that’s your game, is it?’ said he at last.‘Well, we’ll see which is soonest tired.’ And he slowly drew out a fine cigar-case, picked one to his taste, lit it, took a book from the shelf convenient to his hand, then leaning back, proceeded to smoke and read as tranquilly as if he had been in his own room in Grove Street, X—shire, England.I knew he was capable of continuing in that attitude till midnight, if he conceived the whim; so I rose, and taking the book from his hand, I said,—"
"“你没有向我要过书，你不应该看。”","‘You did not ask for it, and you shall not have it.’"
"“真是愚蠢无聊之极，”他说，“所以我还没有输很多是吧。”就这样尴尬局面被打破了，他接着说道：“我以为你住在珀莱先生那。今天下午我去他那儿，以为要坐在寄宿学校的客厅里饿死，他们告诉我你已经离开了——今天上午走的。但是你离开时留下了地址，我觉得很奇怪，因为这种预防措施很实际、很理智，我还觉得你没那么聪明呢。你为什么要离开？”","‘It is silly and dull,’ he observed, ‘so I have not lost much;’ then, the spell being broken, he went on, ‘I thought you lived at Pelet’s.I went there this afternoon, expecting to be starved to death by sitting in a boarding-school drawing-room, and they told me you were gone—had departed this morning.You had left your address behind you though, which I wondered at; it was a more practical and sensible precaution than I should have imagined you capable of. Why did you leave?’"
"“因为珀莱先生刚刚跟那个你和布朗先生都指定给我当妻子的女人结婚了。”","‘Because M. Pelet has just married the lady whom you and Mr. Brown assigned to me as my wife.’"
"“哦，真的啊！”亨斯登短笑了一声。“所以说你赔了夫人又折兵了？”","‘Oh, indeed!’ replied Hunsden, with a short laugh.’So you’ve lost both your wife and your place?’"
"“正是这样。”","‘Precisely so.’"
"我看见他偷偷而迅速地四处扫视了一下我的房间；他留意到了狭小的房间和寒酸的家具。他立马就理解了事态——一下子免除了我享乐荣华的罪过。这个发现在他奇特的脑海里产生了古怪的效果。我心里能确定，如果他发现我置身于一个富丽堂皇的客厅，懒洋洋地躺在柔软的沙发上，旁边是漂亮而富有的妻子，他肯定会恨我。那样的话，他最多只会出于礼貌进行一次短暂、冷酷而傲慢的拜访，只要财富之潮将我稳稳地托在其表面，他就绝不会再靠近我；但是那刷过油漆的家具，空荡的墙壁，还有阴郁又孤寂的房间却使他僵硬的自尊心软化了，当他再次说话时，我不知道他的声音和表情都为何变温和了很多。","I saw him give a quick, covert glance all round my room; he marked its narrow limits, its scanty furniture.In an instant he had comprehended the state of matters—had absolved me from the crime of prosperity.A curious effect this discovery wrought in his strange mind.I am morally certain that if he had found me installed in a handsome parlour, lounging on a soft couch, with a pretty, wealthy wife at my side, he would have hated me.A brief, cold, haughty visit would in such a case have been the extreme limit of his civilities, and never would he have come near me more so long as the tide of fortune bore me smoothly on its surface; but the painted furniture, the bare walls, the cheerless solitude of my room relaxed his rigid pride, and I know not what softening change had taken place both in his voice and look ere he spoke again."
"“你又找了份工作？”","‘You have got another place?’"
"“没有呢。”","‘No.’"
"“你正在找？”","‘You are in the way of getting one?’"
"“也没有。”","‘No.’"
"“那很糟糕。你找过布朗先生没？”","‘That is bad.Have you applied to Brown?’"
"“没有，确实没有。”","‘No, indeed.’"
"“你最好去找他，他经常有能力在这种事情上给人提供有用的信息。”","‘You had better; he often has it in his power to give useful information in such matters.’"
"“他已经很好地帮过我一次了；我没有资格，也不愿意再麻烦他。”","‘He served me once very well; I have no claim on him, and am not in the humour to bother him again.’"
"“啊，如果你这么不好意思，害怕麻烦别人，那你只需要委托我就好。我今晚要见他，可以帮你捎句话。","‘Oh, if you’re bashful, and dread being intrusive, you need only commission me. I shall see him to-night; I can put in a word."
"“求求你不要吧，亨斯登先生，我已经欠您了。在Ｘ镇的时候您就帮过我大忙——帮我脱离虎穴，我当时已然奄奄一息了。那次恩情我尚未回报，现在我着实不想再欠你更多人情了。”","‘I beg you will not, Mr. Hunsden; I am in your debt already.You did me an important service when I was at X—; got me out of a den where I was dying.That service I have never repaid, and at present I decline positively adding another item to the account.’"
"“如果你那样想，我就心满意足了。帮你离开那该死的账房是我史无前例的慷慨，我知道这一举动终有一天会得到应有的感激的。圣经上说过，‘将面包丢到水里，很多天后你会找到它的。’是的，那是对的，小伙子，多多依靠我吧，我可是无可匹敌的。在普通人中没有像我这样的。好吧，我们废话少说，讲一会儿有意义的吧，你的处境会大大好转，此外，如果你拒绝任何人提供给你的工作，那你就是个大傻瓜。”","‘If the wind sits that way, I’m satisfied.I thought my unexampled generosity in turning you out of that accursed counting-house would be duly appreciated some day. “Cast your bread on the waters, and it shall be found after many days,” say the Scriptures.Yes, that’s right, lad; make much of me—I’m a nonpareil.There’s nothing like me in the common herd.In the meantime, to put all humbug aside and talk sense for a few moments, you would be greatly the better of a situation, and what is more, you are a fool if you refuse to take one from any hand that offers it.’"
"“很好，亨斯登先生。如今你已经解决了这个问题，再讲点别的吧。Ｘ镇有什么新闻吗？”","‘Very well, Mr. Hunsden.Now you have settled that point, talk of something else.What news from X—?’"
"“我还没解决这个问题呢，至少在我们讲Ｘ镇之前还有一个事情要解决——那个佐诺比小姐（“是佐蕾德”，我更正道）——好吧，佐蕾德，真的嫁给珀莱了吗？”","‘I have not settled that point, or at least there is another to settle before we get to X—.Is this Miss Zénobie’ (‘Zoraïde,’ interposed I)—‘well, Zoraïde—is she really married to Pelet?’"
"“我都说是了；如果你不相信我，可以去问问圣雅克教堂的牧师。”","‘I tell you yes; and if you don’t believe me, go and ask the curé of St. Jacques.’"
"“那你心碎了？”","‘And your heart is broken?’"
"“我觉得它没碎。它感觉良好——像往常一样跳动。”","‘I am not aware that it is. It feels all right—beats as usual.’"
"“那么你的感情并不像我所想的那么细腻。你肯定是个粗俗麻木的人，受到这么大的打击竟然没有摇晃着倒下。”","‘Then your feelings are less superfine than I took them to be.You must be a coarse, callous character to bear such a thwack without staggering under it.’"
"“摇晃着倒下？一位比利时女校长嫁给一位法国男校长，我究竟为什么要倒下呢？他们的子孙绝对会是奇怪混血儿，但这是他们担心的事，不是我的。”","‘Staggering under it?What the deuce is there to stagger under in the circumstance of a Belgian schoolmistress marrying a French schoolmaster?The progeny will doubtless be a strange hybrid race; but that’s their lookout, not mine.’"
"“他竟然说起粗俗的笑话来，那个新娘曾是他的未婚妻呢！”","‘He indulges in scurrilous jests, and the bride was his affianced one!’"
"“谁说的呀？”","‘Who said so?’"
"“布朗。”","‘Brown.’"
"“我告诉你吧，亨斯登，布朗就是一个爱传播谣言的老头子。”","‘I’ll tell you what, Hunsden: Brown is an old gossip.’"
"“他的确是；但与此同时，如果他的小道消息是无风起浪，如果你对佐蕾德小姐毫无兴趣，那么，年轻的教员，为什么她成了珀莱夫人后你就离开那了呢？”","‘He is; but in the meantime, if his gossip be founded on less than fact, if you took no particular interest in Miss Zoraïde, why, O youthful pedagogue, did you leave your place in consequence of her becoming Madame Pelet?’"
"“那是因为”——我觉得自己的脸有点发烫——“因为，简而言之，亨斯登先生，我拒绝再回答任何问题。”我把双手深深地插进裤袋里。","‘Because’—I felt my face grow a little hot—‘because, in short, Mr. Hunsden, I decline answering any more questions;’ and I plunged my hands deep in my breeches pocket."
"亨斯登打了胜仗；他的眼睛，他的笑声都宣布着他的胜利。","Hunsden triumphed; his eyes, his laugh announced victory."
"“你到底在笑什么，亨斯登先生？”","‘What the deuce are you laughing at, Mr. Hunsden?’"
"“笑你真是够沉着。好了，小伙子，我不烦你了。我明白是怎么一回事了。佐蕾德抛弃了你——嫁给了一个更有钱的人，任何理智的女人只要有机会都会这么做的。”","‘At your exemplary composure.Well, lad, I’ll not bore you.I see how it is. Zoraïde has jilted you—married some one richer, as any sensible woman would have done if she had had the chance.’"
"我没有回应，随他怎么去想，我不想去解释事情的真相，更不想编造谎言。但是蒙蔽亨斯登是不容易的。我的沉默，不但没有使他确信已经知道真相，反而似乎使他对此产生怀疑。他接着说道——","I made no reply, I let him think so, not feeling inclined to enter into an explanation of the real state of things, and as little to forge a false account.But it was not easy to blind Hunsden.My very silence, instead of convincing him that he had hit the truth, seemed to render him doubtful about it.He went on,—"
"“我想这类事情发生在理智的人身上时一般是这样解决的。你提供她青春和才华——这些你都有——用来交换她的地位和金钱。我认为你不会以貌取人，或者看重所谓的爱情，因为我知道她比你年龄大，而且布朗说她虽看上去很聪敏，但并不美丽。她没法要得更多了，所以一开始就和你交往了；但是珀莱作为一所生意兴隆的学校校长，以更高的价钱插了一脚。她接受了他，而他就得到了她。这是一笔正确的交易——完全正确——就像做生意一样，十分正当。那我们现在谈点别的吧。”","‘I suppose the affair has been conducted as such affairs always are amongst rational people.You offered her your youth and your talents—such as they are—in exchange for her position and money.I don’ t suppose you took appearance, or what is called love, into the account—for I understand she is older than you, and Brown says rather sensible looking than beautiful.She having then no chance of making a better bargain, was at first inclined to come to terms with you; but Pelet, the head of a flourishing school, stepped in with a higher bid. She accepted, and he has got her: a correct transaction—perfectly so—business-like and legitimate.And now we’ll talk of something else.’"
"“那谈吧。”我很庆幸摆脱了这个话题，尤其庆幸能够抵挡住这位盘问者的精明审问——如果我真的已经挡住了它的话；因为虽然他说的话已经远离了那个危险的话题，但他敏锐机警的眼睛似乎表明他还在思量着之前的问题。","‘Do,’ said I, very glad to dismiss the topic, and especially glad to have baffled the sagacity of my cross-questioner—if indeed, I had baffled it; for though his words now led away from the dangerous point, his eyes, keen and watchful, seemed still preoccupied with the former idea."
"“你想听听来自Ｘ镇的消息吗？你对Ｘ镇还有什么牵挂呢？你在那里没有留下朋友，因为你在那里没有交上朋友。无论男女都没有人问过你；如果我在朋友中提及你的名字，男人们看起来就像我在说普雷斯特·约翰那样无所谓，而女人们则偷偷地嘲笑着。我们Ｘ镇的美女们肯定都很不喜欢你。你怎么惹她们不高兴了？”","‘You want to hear news from X—?And what interest can you have in X—?You left no friends there, for you made none.Nobody ever asks after you, neither man nor woman; and if I mention your name in company, the men look as if I had spoken of Prester John, and the women sneer covertly.Our X— belles must have disliked you.How did you excite their displeasure?’"
"“我不知道。我很少跟她们说话——她们对我而言无关紧要。我觉得她们是只可远观的东西。她们的穿着和面孔常使我赏心悦目，但是我不懂她们的对话，甚至也看不懂她们的表情。有时我无意中听到她们的谈话，根本就不解其意；她们双唇和眼睛的动作也没有给我启发。”","‘I don’t know.I seldom spoke to them—they were nothing to me.I considered them only as something to be glanced at from a distance.Their dresses and faces were often pleasing enough to the eye, but I could not understand their conversation, nor even read their countenances.When I caught snatches of what they said, I could never make much of it; and the play of their lips and eyes did not help me at all.’"
"“那就是你的过错，不是她们的。Ｘ镇有很多又漂亮又聪明的女人。女人值得任何一个男人与之交谈，我就很喜欢和女人交谈。但是你不论过去还是现在，都没有过愉快的交谈经历，在你身上没有什么能赢得女人的青睐。我曾经见过在满是人的房间里，你只坐在房门旁，俯身倾听着，却不喜欢交谈；一直观察着，却不喜欢主动迎合；聚会开始时显得呆板害羞，聚会中间显得迷惑警惕，聚会结束时又显得疲倦无礼。你觉得这样能够传递愉悦或者引起别人的兴趣吗？不能；如果大家都不喜欢你，那就说明你是咎由自取。”","‘That was your fault, not theirs.There are sensible as well as handsome women in X—.women it is worth any man’s while to talk to, and with whom I can talk with pleasure.But you had and have no pleasant address; there is nothing in you to induce a woman to be affable.I have remarked you sitting near the door in a room full of company, bent on hearing, not on speaking; on observing, not on entertaining; looking frigidly shy at the commencement of a party, confusingly vigilant about the middle, and insultingly weary towards the end. Is that the way, do you think, ever to communicate pleasure or excite interest?No; and if you are generally unpopular, it is because you deserve to be so.’"
"“我就愿意这样！”我叫道。","‘Content!’ I ejaculated."
"“不是的，你不愿意的。看见美女们总是对你毫不理睬，你深感羞辱，然后便嗤之以鼻。我坚定不移地相信世界上所有令人渴望的事情——财富、名誉、爱情——对你而言永远都是高架上熟透的葡萄。你会抬头看它们；它们引诱着你，使你露出贪婪的眼神，但是你却够不到它们。你没有地方找梯子，只得离开，口里还叫着它们是酸的。”","‘No, you are not content.You see beauty always turning its back on you; you are mortified, and then you sneer.I verify believe all that is desirable on earth—wealth, reputation, love—will for ever to you be the ripe grapes on the high trellis.You’ll look up at them; they will tantalize in you the lust of the eye; but they are out of reach.You have not the address to fetch a ladder, and you’ll go away calling them sour.’"
"有些时候，这些话让我觉得很尖刻，可是这次却没有让我血流不止。自从离开Ｘ镇，我的生活就改变了，我的经历也是五味杂陈，但是亨斯登是不知道这一点的。他只看过作为克里姆斯沃思先生职员的我——那时我在富有的陌生人眼中只是一个仆人，不会在意别人的轻蔑，因为知道自己不善交际，外表毫无魅力，不会去特意吸引注意，因为知道没有人会来关注我，也不会阿谀奉承，因为知道会由于毫无用处而遭人鄙夷。他不可能知道，自那以后，年轻而可爱的姑娘们成了我每天接触的对象，我可以从容而仔细地审视她们，看到她们靓丽外表下的平庸本质；尽管他的目光如此犀利，也无法穿过我的内心，探寻我的大脑，读懂我所特有的同情和反感。他认识我的时间还不够长，或对我不够了解，没办法感知我的感情在某些影响下会退缩脆弱，而在大多人面前又很有力；在某种影响下我感情的潮水会激昂奔腾，或许有一股力量左右着我，它们由于只对我一个人有影响而显得更为有力。他也绝不会想到我和勒泰小姐还有这样一段往事。她对我的痴心对于他，对于其他所有的人来说都是个秘密。她的花言巧语，她的阴谋诡计只有我见过，也只有我知道。但是它们已经改变了我，这是因为它们证明我能够给人留下印象的。我的内心里还住着另一个更为甜蜜的秘密，那是个充满柔情与力量的秘密。它抚平了亨斯登先生冷嘲热讽所带来的刺痛，它使我受到屈辱而不屈服，面对愤慨而不愤怒。但是，对于这一切我什么都不能说——因为什么都没有最终确定下来；正因为不确定，我没有说话，只以沉默回复亨斯登先生，在沉默之中，我下定决心，目前就让他误解我吧，反正我已经被误解了。他以为他对我说得有些重，以为我被他的谴责压垮了；为了安慰我他又确定地说总有一天我会开窍的，说我的人生才刚刚起步，庆幸的是，我又不是不懂情理，我所走错的每一步都会成为很好的教训。","Cutting as these words might have been under some circumstances, they drew no blood now. My life was changed, my experience had been varied since I left X—; but Hunsden could not know this.He had seen me only in the character of Mr. Crimsworth’s clerk—a dependant amongst wealthy strangers, meeting disdain with a hard front, conscious of an unsocial and unattractive exterior, refusing to sue for notice which I was sure would be withheld, declining to evince an admiration which I knew would be scorned as worthless.He could not be aware that since then youth and loveliness had been to me everyday objects, that I had studied them at leisure and closely, and had seen the plain texture of truth under the embroidery of appearance; nor could he, keen-sighted as he was, penetrate into my heart, search my brain, and read my peculiar sympathies and antipathies.He had not known me long enough or well enough to perceive how low my feelings would ebb under some influences, powerful over most minds; how high, how fast they would flow under other influences, that perhaps acted with the more intense force on me because they acted on me alone.Neither could he suspect for an instant the history of my communications with Mdlle. Reuter.Secret to him and to all others was the tale of her strange infatuation.Her blandishments, her wiles had been seen but by me, and to me only were they known.but they had changed me, for they had proved that I could impress.A sweeter secret nestled deeper in my heart, one full of tenderness and as full of strength.It took the sting out of Hunsden’s sarcasm; it kept me unbent by shame and unstirred by wrath.But, of all this I could say nothing—nothing decisive at least; uncertainty sealed my lips, and during the interval of silence by which alone I replied to Mr. Hunsden, I made up my mind to be for the present wholly misjudged by him, and misjudged I was.He thought he had been rather too hard upon me, and that I was crushed by the weight of his upbraidings; so to reassure me he said doubtless I should mend some day. I was only at the beginning of life yet; and since happily I was not quite without sense, every false step I made would be a good lesson."
"就在那时我的脸稍稍朝光亮转了转。因为已近黄昏，而我的位置又是在靠窗处，所以在刚刚的十分钟内他看不到我的表情；然而当我转过来时，他捕捉到了我的表情，并这样理解它，——","Just then I turned my face a little to the light.The approach of twilight and my position in the window-seat had, for the last ten minutes, prevented him from studying my countenance; as I moved, however, he caught an expression which he thus interpreted,—"
"“真是讨厌！你这个臭小子看起来多么地顽固不堪，自以为很了不起！我还以为他会羞愧至死，他却坐在那咧着嘴笑，像是在说：‘让别人说去吧，我在我的背心口袋里装满了魔法石，橱柜里装着长生不老药；命运和财富都奈何不了我！”","‘Confound it!How doggedly self-approving the lad looks!I thought he was fit to die with shame, and there he sits grinning smiles, as good as to say, “Let the world wag as it will, I’ve the philosopher’s stone in my waistcoat pocket and the elixir of life in my cupboard; I’m independent of both fate and fortune!”"
"“亨斯登，你提到葡萄，我就想到一种果子，与你们Ｘ镇温室里葡萄相比我更喜欢那个。它是一种极为罕见的水果，生长在野外，我已经做了记号是属于我的，希望某一天能够摘下来尝尝。你给我提供这些苦药喝，还威胁我不喝就会渴死，其实这些都没有用。我期待着甘甜进入我的味蕾，希望感受唇间的信息；我拒绝喝那种令人作呕的东西，我能忍受干涸。”","‘Hunsden, you spoke of grapes; I was thinking of a fruit I like better than your X— hothouse grapes—a unique fruit, growing wild, which I have marked as my own, and hope one day to gather and taste.It is of no use your offering me the draught of bitterness or threatening me with death by thirst.I have the anticipation of sweetness on MY palate, the hope of freshness on my lips; I can reject the unsavoury and endure the exhausting.’"
"“能够忍受多久？”","‘For how long?’"
"“直到下次我付出努力时；既然成功的奖赏是我发自内心珍视的财宝，那我就要用尽一头牛的力气去奋斗。”","‘Till the next opportunity for effort; and as the prize of success will be a treasure after my own heart, I’ll bring a bull’s strength to the struggle.’"
"“厄运会像压碎李子一样易如反掌地压碎那头牛；我相信，你一直厄运缠身，你是生来嘴里就含着木匙的，准是这样。”","‘Bad luck crushes bulls as easily as bullaces; and, I believe, the fury dogs you. You were born with a wooden spoon in your mouth, depend on it.’"
"“我相信你；但是我想用我的木匙去干一些别人用银匙干的事情。只要抓得紧，用得麻利，就算是木匙也能够舀上可口的高汤。”","‘I believe you; and I mean to make my wooden spoon do the work of some people’s silver ladles.Grasped firmly and handled nimbly, even a wooden spoon will shovel up broth.’"
"亨斯登站了起来。“我懂了。”他说道，“我想你是那种没人看护就能成长，没人帮忙就能干好的人。按你自己的方法干下去吧。现在我要走了。”。他没有再多说话便离开了，到了门口他又转过身来","Hunsden rose.‘I see,’ said he.‘I suppose you’re one of those who develop best unwatched and act best unaided.Work your own way.Now, I’ll go.’ And without another word he was going; at the door he turned."
"“克里姆斯沃思公馆被卖了。”他说。","‘Crimsworth Hall is sold,’ said he."
"“卖了！”我惊呼道。","‘Sold!’ was my echo."
"“是的。你应该知道你哥哥三个月前破产了？”","‘Yes.You know, of course, that your brother failed three months ago?’"
"“什么！爱德华·克里姆斯沃思？”","‘What!Edward Crimsworth?’"
"“一点不错，他老婆回她父亲家了。他的脾气也随着破产偏离了常态。他一直对她不好。我曾跟你说过，总有一天他会像一个暴君一样对她。至于他——”","‘Precisely; and his wife went home to her father’s.When affairs went awry his temper sympathized with them.He used her ill.I told you he would be a tyrant to her some day.As to him—’"
"“哎，至于他——他怎么了？”","‘Ay, as to him—what is become of him?’"
"“没什么特别的，别紧张。他寻求法院的保护，和他的债权人进去和解，最终要求一英镑先还十便士——六个星期之后他又东山再起，把老婆哄回来，现在又像月桂树一样繁荣起来。”","‘Nothing extraordinary; don’t be alarmed.He put himself under the protection of the court, compounded with his creditors—ten-pence in the pound—in six weeks set up again, coaxed back his wife, and is flourishing like a green bay tree.’"
"“那克里姆斯沃思公馆的——家具也卖了吗？”","‘And Crimsworth Hall—was the furniture sold too?’"
"“所有东西——从大钢琴到擀面杖。”","‘Everything—from the grand piano down to the rolling-pin.’"
"“那橡木餐厅里的东西呢——它们也卖掉了吗？”","‘And the contents of the oak dining-room—were they sold?’"
"“当然了。为什么把那个房间的沙发和椅子看得比其他房间的更神圣呢？”","‘Of course.Why should the sofas and chairs of that room be held more sacred than those of any other?’"
"“那些画也卖了？”","‘And the pictures?’"
"“什么画啊？据我所知克里姆斯沃思没有什么特别的收藏啊。他没说过他是一位业余收藏家呀。”","‘What pictures?Crimsworth had no special collection that I know of. He did not profess to be an amateur.’"
"“那里有两幅肖像画的，壁炉两边各一张。你不会忘记的，亨斯登先生，你曾注意过那幅夫人的画像——”","‘There were two portraits, one on each side the mantelpiece.You cannot have forgotten them, Mr. Hunsden; you once noticed that of the lady—’"
"“哦，我记起来了！那个面容很清瘦，披着像帷帐一样披肩的贵妇人。哎，它肯定是跟别的东西混在一起卖掉了。如果你很富有的话，也许会把它买下来，因为我记得你说过画的是你母亲。你看现在身无分文就什么也干不成吧。”","‘Oh, I know! the thin-faced gentlewoman with a shawl put on like drapery.Why, as a matter of course, it would be sold among the other things.If you had been rich, you might have bought it, for I remember you said it represented your mother.You see what it is to be without a sou.’"
"这个我懂。“但是肯定的，”我暗想，“我绝不会总是这般穷困潦倒，总有一天我会把它赎回来”——“谁买过去了？你知道吗？”我问道。","I did.‘But surely,’ I thought to myself, ‘I shall not always be so poverty-stricken; I may one day buy it back yet.’—‘Who purchased it?Do you know?’ I asked."
"“我怎么可能知道？我从来没问过谁买了什么东西。你可真不现实——以为全世界都对你所感兴趣的东西有兴趣！好了，晚安了；我明早要去德国。六个星期后我会回来，也许我会再来看看你。不知道那时候你会不会还是失业呢！”他笑了起来，像梅菲斯特那样嘲讽而又无情，他就这样笑着，消失不见了。","‘How is it likely?I never inquired who purchased anything.There spoke the unpractical man—to imagine all the world is interested in what interests himself!Now, goodnight; I’m off for Germany to-morrow morning.I shall be back here in six weeks, and possibly I may call and see you again.I wonder whether you’ll be still out of place!’ he laughed, as mockingly, as heartlessly as Mephistopheles, and so laughing, vanished."
"一些人不管在久别之后感情多么冷淡，总是会在重逢离开时尽量留下一个好的印象。但是亨斯登不是这样的。和他谈次话就像吞了秘鲁树皮一样：真是又苦又涩，味道很重。不知道它是不是跟金鸡纳树皮一样有可以使人精力充沛的。","Some people, however indifferent they may become after a considerable space of absence, always contrive to leave a pleasant impression just at parting.Not so Hunsden.A conference with him affected one like a draught of Peruvian bark: it seemed a concentration of the specially harsh, stringent, bitter.Whether, Eke bark, it invigorated, I scarcely knew."
"心情烦乱便会辗转反侧。会面之后那晚我几乎未眠。早晨的时候刚开始犯瞌睡，还没等进入梦乡，又被吵醒了；我卧室毗连的起居室里传出一阵声音——一阵脚步声和拖家具的声音。那声响只持续了两分钟的样子，门关上之后就停止了。我仔细听了听：不是老鼠的声音。也许我只是做梦吧；也许某位房客误进了我的房间，把我的房间当做他自己的了。现在才刚刚五点钟；我还没有清醒，天也还没有大亮。我翻了下身，很快便睡着了。大概两个小时后我起床时，已经忘了刚才听到的那些响声。但是我离开卧室时，看到的第一件东西让我又想了起来。我一推开起居室的门，就看见一个木制的行李箱倒立着放在门口——是个制作粗劣的箱子，很宽但很浅。无疑是搬运工人搬来的，发现房间里没人便放在门口了。","A ruffled mind makes a restless pillow.I slept little on the night after this interview.Towards morning I began to doze, but hardly had my slumber become sleep when I was roused from it by hearing a noise in my sitting-room, to which my bedroom adjoined—a step and a shoving of furniture.The movement lasted barely two minutes; with the closing of the door it ceased.I listened: not a mouse stirred.Perhaps I had dreamt it; perhaps a locataire had made a mistake and entered my apartment instead of his own.It was yet but five o’clock; neither I nor the day was wide awake.I turned, and was soon unconscious.When I did rise, about two hours later, I had forgotten the circumstance.The first thing I saw, however, on quitting my chamber, recalled it.Just pushed in at the door of my sitting- room, and still standing on end, was a wooden packing-case—a rough deal affair, wide but shallow.A porter had doubtless shoved it forward, but seeing no occupant of the room, had left it at the entrance."
"“那肯定不是我的，”我边想边走过去，“肯定是寄给别人的。”我停下来看了看地址：——“威廉·克里姆斯沃思，布鲁塞尔圣某某街某号。”","‘That is none of mine,’ thought I, approaching; ‘it must be meant for somebody else.’ I stooped to examine the address:—‘Wm. Crimsworth, Esq., No.-, -St., Brussels.’"
"我很困惑，但是想要搞清楚情况最好的方式就是看看里面。我割断绳子，打开箱子。绿色的毛毯包着里面的东西，四周仔细地缝住了。我用袖珍折刀挑开包装线，线松开后，镀金的亮光从逐渐变宽的缝隙处露出来。最后我终于拆下木板，拿掉毛毯，从箱子里拿出一副装在华贵相框里的大画像。我将它靠着一张椅子摆好，这样窗外射来的光线刚好照在画面上，我已经戴上了眼镜，后退几步打量。上面是一位肖像画家渲染的天空（极为昏暗而可怕的苍穹）远处的树木用传统的深色调勾勒而成，衬托出一张苍白而哀愁的女性面孔；她的脸上遮着几缕柔软的黑发，几乎与深色的云朵融为一体，那双严肃的大眼睛反思地看着我的眼睛，消瘦的面颊托在精致的小手上，那条披巾很有艺术感地披在身上，纤细的身躯若隐若现。如果身边有人的话，他可能会听见我在沉默注视了十分钟后说出的“母亲！”二字。我本来还会再多说些话，但是那声自言自语的“母亲”让我一下子清醒了过来，它使我想起只有疯子才会自言自语，于是我思忖着我的独白，而没有说出来。我想了很久，良久地注视着她那美丽的灰色双眸中散发出来的睿智和甜美，还有，哎！还有悲伤，和那前额显示出的精神力量，坚毅的嘴巴显示出的不多的敏感；我的目光向下游移，最后落在一个狭窄的图章上，那图章印在画像的角落处，就在画框与画布之间。于是我才想起来要问：“这幅画是谁送来的？谁会为我着想，将它从克里姆斯沃思公馆的残留物中救出来，现在又将它交给本来的主人保管？”我从箱子内部找到一张便条，上面写着：——","I was puzzled, but concluding that the best way to obtain information was to ask within, I cut the cords and opened the case.Green baize enveloped its contents, sewn carefully at the sides.I ripped the pack-thread with my penknife, and still, as the seam gave way, glimpses of gilding appeared through the widening interstices.Boards and baize being at length removed, I lifted from the case a large picture, in a magnificent frame.Leaning it against a chair, in a position where the light from the window fell favourably upon it, I stepped back; already I had mounted my spectacles.A portrait-painter’s sky (the most sombre and threatening of welkins) and distant trees of a conventional depth of hue raised in full relief a pale, pensive-looking female face, shadowed with soft dark hair, almost blending with the equally dark clouds; large, solemn eyes looked reflectively into mine; a thin cheek rested on a delicate little hand, a shawl, artistically draped, half hid, half showed a slight figure.A listener (had there been one) might have heard me, after ten minutes’ silent gazing, utter the word ‘Mother!’ I might have said more, but with me the first word uttered aloud in soliloquy rouses consciousness; it reminds me that only crazy people talk to themselves, and then I think out my monologue instead of speaking it.I had thought a long while, and a long while had contemplated the intelligence, the sweetness, and, alas!the sadness also of those fine gray eyes, the mental power of that forehead, and the rare sensibility of that serious mouth, when my glance, travelling downwards, fell on a narrow billet, stuck in the corner of the picture, between the frame and the canvas.Then I first asked, ‘Who sent this picture?Who thought of me, saved it out of the wreck of Crimsworth Hall, and now commits it to the care of its natural keeper?’ I took the note from its niche thus it spoke:—"
"“给小孩糖果，给傻瓜铃铛，给狗骨头，这其中有一种愚笨的愉快。当你看到小孩被糖弄脏了脸，看见傻瓜的满心欢喜换来更多的洋相，看见狗啃着骨头兽性大发，你就得到了报酬。在我把威廉·克里姆斯沃思母亲的画像寄给他时，我就是把糖果、铃铛以及骨头一起给了他。可惜的是，我不能亲眼目睹他的反应。只要拍卖商能给我那种乐趣，我愿意再加追五先令。","‘There is a sort of stupid pleasure in giving a child sweets, a fool his bells, a dog a bone.You are repaid by seeing the child besmear his face with sugar, by witnessing how the fool’s ecstasy makes a greater fool of him than ever, by watching the dog’s nature come out over his bone.In giving William Crimsworth his mother’s picture, I give him sweets, bells, and bone all in one. What grieves me is that I cannot behold the result.I would have added five shillings more to my bid if the auctioneer could only have promised me that pleasure."
"H. Y. H.","H. Y. H."
"“此外——你昨晚说你坚决不肯再在欠我的账单上添上一项，你难道不认为我已经帮你省了那个麻烦吗？”","‘P. S.—You said last night you positively declined adding another item to your account with me. Don’t you think I’ve saved you that trouble?’"
"我用那块绿色毛毯又将画像包好，装回箱子里，将整个箱子搬回我的卧室，放在我看不见的床底下。此时，我的欢乐已经被剧痛代替；我决定在能安适悠闲地欣赏它之前，不再看它。如果亨斯登此时进来，我会对他说：“我什么都不欠你，亨斯登——一分钱都不欠你；你已经用讥讽替我还了你的债了。”","I muffled the picture in its green baize covering, restored it to the case, and having transported the whole concern to my bedroom, put it out of sight under my bed. My pleasure was now poisoned by pungent pain; I determined to look no more till I could look at my ease.If Hunsden had come in at that moment, I should have said to him, ‘I owe you nothing, Hunsden—not a fraction of a farthing; you have paid yourself in taunts.’"
"我十分不安，久久不能平静，一用过早餐便再次造访范登赫顿先生，虽然并未指望能在他家见到他——因为自我第一次拜访后过了还不到一个星期——但是我说不定能打听到他什么时候回来。想不到等待我的是个更好的结果；因为虽然他家人还在奥斯坦德，但是范登赫顿先生那天恰好回布鲁塞尔办事。他平静、真诚而友善地接待了我，尽管他不是那种容易兴奋的人。我在他办公室还没单独坐上五分钟，便感到在他面前很自在，以前跟陌生人在一起时我很少有这种感觉。我很意外自己竟这么镇静，因为毕竟我来这里是要完成一件很痛苦的事——求别人的帮忙。我问自己究竟为什么这么沉着呢。我害怕理由是站不住脚的。不久我就抓到了某种根据，立即觉得它很坚固，我知道自己的位置了。","Too anxious to remain any longer quiescent, I had no sooner breakfasted than I repaired once more to M. Vandenhuten’s, scarcely hoping to find him at home—for a week had barely elapsed since my first call—but fancying I might be able to glean information as to the time when his return was expected.A better result awaited me than I had anticipated; for though the family were yet at Ostend, M. Vandenhuten had come over to Brussels on business for the day.He received me with the quiet kindness of a sincere though not excitable man.I had not sat five minutes alone with him in his bureau before I became aware of a sense of ease in his presence such as I rarely experienced with strangers.I was surprised at my own composure, for, after all, I had come on business to me exceedingly painful—that of soliciting a favour.I asked on what basis the calm rested.I feared it might be deceptive.Ere long I caught a glimpse of the ground, and at once I felt assured of its solidity; I knew where I was."
"范登赫顿先生十分富有，受人尊敬，举足轻重；而我一穷二白，受人鄙视，无权无势。对于这个世界来说我们不过是社会中的两个成员；但是作为一对特定的人，我们彼此的位置相差甚远。这位荷兰人（他不是佛兰芒人，而是纯荷兰人）行动迟缓，十分冷静，拥有敏锐的判断力，而理解力并不缜密：而我这个英国人无论计划还是行动，构思还是实现都更容易神经紧张，积极迅速。这位荷兰人仁慈亲切，而我这个英国人易动感情；简而言之，我们的性格有些相似，但我的头脑更有活力更爱思考，于是便本能地占据并保持着优势。","M. Vandenhuten was rich, respected, and influential; I poor, despised, and powerless.So we stood to the world at large as members of the world’s society; but to each other, as a pair of human beings, our positions were reversed.The Dutchman (he was not Flamand, but pure Hollandais) was slow, cool, of rather dense intelligence, though sound and accurate judgment: the Englishman far more nervous, active, quicker both to plan and to practise, to conceive and to realize.The Dutchman was benevolent, the Englishman susceptible; in short, our characters dovetailed, but my mind having more fire and action than his, instinctively assumed and kept the predominance."
"这一点想明白了，我的位置也就摆得很清楚了；我向他毫不隐瞒地介绍自己的情况，只有满怀信心时我才会这样。他因为我来向他求助而很开心，他感谢我给了他这样一个机会能够为我尽绵薄之力。我接着解释说，我的愿望并不是让他给予很大的帮助，只想请他为我指明自助的方向；我并不想他直接帮我安排——那是我的事情——我只是想让他给一些信息并给以推荐。不久我便起身离开，他伸手表示告别——外国人比英国人更为注重这种礼节。当我向他微笑时，我想他真诚的面孔上显示的善意比我面孔上的智慧好很多。我这种身份的人能和像维克多·范登赫顿这样心胸坦荡的人接触，心里极为安慰。","This point settled, and my position well ascertained, I addressed him on the subject of my affairs with that genuine frankness which full confidence can alone inspire.It was a pleasure to him to be so appealed to; he thanked me for giving him this opportunity of using a little exertion in my behalf.I went on to explain to him that my wish was not so much to be helped as to be put into the way of helping myself; of him I did not want exertion—that was to be my part—but only information and recommendation.Soon after I rose to go. He held out his hand at parting—an action of greater significance with foreigners than with Englishmen.As I exchanged a smile with him, I thought the benevolence of his truthful face was better than the intelligence of my own. Characters of my order experience a balm-like solace in the contact of such souls as animated the honest breast of Victor Vandenhuten."
"接下来的两个星期是充满变数的时期，那一段时间我的生活就像是秋日的夜晚，天空中徘徊着流星和陨石。希望与担心，期望与失望，如阵雨般闪烁着从天顶滑向地面；但是这一切都极为短暂，每次幻象消逝之后，黑暗就立即随之而来。范登赫顿先生全心全意地给予我帮助。他介绍了好几个地方给我，还亲自为我担保；但是长久以来他的恳求与推荐都是徒劳无功的——学校的大门要不是在我走入之前就关上，要不就是有人捷足先登，使得我怎么努力都是无济于事。我激动而愤怒，但是并没有被失望击倒。失败紧跟着失败，我的意志却越挫越勇。我不再吹毛求疵，不再沉默矜持，把骄傲远远甩开；我询问着，坚持着，抗议着，催促着。就这样那守卫森严的圈子被强行打开了，我看见命运之神正坐在里面给予周围之人恩惠。我的坚持不懈使我为人所知晓，我的死缠烂打使我为人所注意。有人开始询问我的事，我之前学生的父母根据孩子们的反映，只要听到有人夸我很能干，他们便附和着。这种赞美之声在周围随意流传着，最后传到一些有权势的人耳中，要不是因为流传广泛，也许永远不会为这些人所知；正当我竭尽全力但仍不知所措的关键时刻，幸运之神在一天上午眷顾了我，当时我正苦闷绝望地坐在床前，她如老朋友般熟悉地向我点头——尽管对天发誓我以前从没见过她——她在我的腿上扔了一个奖品。","The next fortnight was a period of many alternations; my existence during its lapse resembled a sky of one of those autumnal nights which are specially haunted by meteors and falling stars.Hopes and fears, expectations and disappointments, descended in glancing showers from zenith to horizon; but all were transient, and darkness followed swift each vanishing apparition.M. Vandenhuten aided me faithfully.He set me on the track of several places, and himself made efforts to secure them for me; but for a long time solicitation and recommendation were vain—the door either shut in my face when I was about to walk in, or another candidate, entering before me, rendered my further advance useless.Feverish and roused, no disappointment arrested me；defeat following fast on defeat served as stimulants to will.I forgot fastidiousness, conquered reserve, thrust pride from me; I asked, I persevered, I remonstrated, I dunned.It is so that openings are forced into the guarded circle where Fortune sits dealing favours round.My perseverance made me known; my importunity made me remarked.I was inquired about; my former pupils’ parents, gathering the reports of their children, heard me spoken of as talented, and they echoed the word.The sound, bandied about at random, came at last to ears which, but for its universality, it might never have reached; and at the very crisis when I had tried my last effort, and knew not what to do, Fortune looked in at me one morning, as I sat in drear and almost desperate deliberation on my bedstead, nodded with the familiarity of an old acquaintance—though God knows I had never met her before—and threw a prize into my lap."
"一八几几年十月的第二个星期，我得到了一个英语教师的职位，教授布鲁塞尔某某学院所有的班级，年薪三千法郎，凭借这一职位所获得的名声和宣传，可以使我在外面兼职的时候赚更多的钱。告知我这一消息的正式通知还提到，正是商人范登赫顿先生的强有力举荐，才使得入选的天平倾向了我一边。","In the second week of October 18-- I got the appointment of English professor to all the classes of—College, Brussels, with a salary of three thousand francs per annum, and the certainty of being able, by dint of the reputation and publicity accompanying the position, to make as much more by private lessons.The official notice which communicated this information mentioned also that it was the strong recommendation of M. Vandenhuten, négociant, which had turned the scale of choice in my favour."
"我一看完通知便急忙跑到范登赫顿先生的办公室，将聘书推到他的面前，当他细读完之后我便抓住他的双手，难以抑制住兴奋地向他表示感谢。我充满活力的言语和坚决有力的手势感染了这位一向平静的荷兰人，他也不同寻常地激动起来。他说他很开心——很高兴能帮到我，但他说区区小事不足挂齿。他连一个生丁都没花，只是在一张纸上随便写了几句话罢了。","No sooner had I read the announcement than I hurried to M. Vandenhuten’s bureau, pushed the document under his nose, and when he had perused it, took both his hands and thanked him with unrestrained vivacity.My vivid words and emphatic gesture moved his Dutch calm to unwonted sensation.He said he was happy—glad to have served me, but he had done nothing meriting such thanks.He had not laid out a centime, only scratched a few words on a sheet of paper."
"可我还是重复地说道——","Again I repeated to him,—"
"“您让我感到很高兴，这种方式也很适合我。从您这样慷慨的人手中得到援助，我毫不觉得欠着什么令我苦恼的人情，我完全不觉得因为您给予过我恩惠，我就得躲避您。从今天起，您一定得同意让我做您的好友，因为从今往后我会经常看望您的。”","‘You have made me quite happy, and in a way that suits me.I do not feel an obligation irksome, conferred by your kind hand; I do not feel disposed to shun you because you have done me a favour.From this day you must consent to admit me to your intimate acquaintance, for I shall hereafter recur again and again to the pleasure of your society.’"
"“这样很好。”他回答说，脸上带着和蔼满足的微笑。我内心充满阳光地微笑着离开了他家。","‘Ainsi soit-il,’ was the reply, accompanied by a smile of benignant content.I went away with its sunshine in my heart."

"当我回到住处时已经两点钟了，午餐刚刚从隔壁的旅馆里端过来，正在桌子上冒着气。我坐下来想着要不要吃：就算盘子里装的都是碎瓦片和碎玻璃，也不能比这炖牛肉和菜豆更让我反胃的了。我已经没有了胃口。看着这些令人毫无胃口的食物，我很不耐烦，便将它们全部放入柜橱里，然后问自己：“现在到晚上我该干点什么呢？”因为下午六点之前到内日河畔的圣母大街去是毫无收获的，因为那里的居民（对我来说那里只有一个居民）仍在别的地方忙着工作呢。从两点钟到六点钟，我一会在布鲁塞尔的大街上散着步，一会又回到自己的房间踱步。在那段时间里我都没有坐下来过；我在自己的房间里踱步时，忽然听见时钟敲了六下。那时我刚洗了脸和发烫的双手，正站在镜子旁。我脸颊通红，眼睛里闪着火焰，但是整个面部表情还是相当镇定平静的。我快速地下楼出门，很高兴还能看见夕阳在云层中西下，我觉得这渐暗的天色像是优雅的屏风，阵阵西北风拂面而来，带来晚秋的寒意，使我感觉凉爽，精神振奋。但是我发现这天气对于其他人来说有点冷，因为从我身边经过的女人们都裹在披巾里，男人们都把上衣扣得很紧。","It was two o’ clock when I returned to my lodgings; my dinner, just brought in from a neighbouring hotel, smoked on the table.I sat down thinking to eat: had the plate been heaped with potsherds and broken glass instead of boiled beef and haricots, I could not have made a more signal failure.Appetite had forsaken me.Impatient of seeing food which I could not taste, I put it all aside into a cupboard, and then demanded, ‘What shall I do till evening?’ for before 6 p.m. it would be vain to seek the Rue Notre Dame aux Neiges; its inhabitant (for me it had but one) was detained by her vocation elsewhere.I walked in the streets of Brussels, and I walked in my own room, from two o’clock till six. Never once in that space of time did I sit down; I was in my chamber when the last-named hour struck.I had just bathed my face and feverish hands, and was standing near the glass.My cheek was crimson, my eye was flame; still all my features looked quite settled and calm.Descending swiftly the stair and stepping out, I was glad to see twilight drawing on in clouds; such shade was to me like a graceful screen, and the chill of later autumn, breathing in a fitful wind from the north-west, met me as a refreshing coolness.Still I saw it was cold to others, for the women I passed were wrapped in shawls, and the men had their coats buttoned close."
"我们什么时候很幸福呢？我过去幸福吗？不幸福。一种急切并渐增的忧虑折磨着我的神经，自从好消息来临时便一直折磨着我。弗朗西斯怎么样了？我上次见到她已是十周之前的事，上次收到她的信或者说听到她的消息已是六周前的事了。我写了个简短的便条回她的信，写得友好而冷静，没有提到要继续联系或者再去拜访她。那时我彷佛在命运的浪尖上飘荡的一艘小船，这滚滚向前的激流会将它带到哪片浅滩上，我无从知晓。正因为如此，我不愿用哪怕最细的线将她的命运与我的命运联系在一起。如果注定要撞到岩石或者搁浅在沙滩上，我决意不让别的船只陪我遭殃；但是六个星期是个很漫长的时间，她身体还好吗？生活得还好吗？不是所有圣贤都一致宣称世上的幸福是没有顶点的吗？我敢不敢设想，此时我离那盛满幸福之水的酒杯——传说此水只从天堂流淌的水中取得——只有半条街之隔呢？","When are we quite happy?Was I so then?No. An urgent and growing dread worried my nerves, and had worried them since the first moment good tidings had reached me.How was Frances?It was ten weeks since I had seen her, six since I had heard from her or of her.I had answered her letter by a brief note, friendly but calm, in which no mention of continued correspondence or further visits was made.At that hour my bark hung on the topmost curl of a wave of fate, and I knew not on what shoal the onward rush of the billow might hurl it.I would not then attach her destiny to mine by the slightest thread.If doomed to split on the rock or run aground on the sandbank, I was resolved no other vessel should share my disaster; but six weeks was a long time, and could it be that she was still well and doing well?Were not all sages agreed in declaring that happiness finds no climax on earth?Dared I think that but half a street now divided me from the full cup of contentment—the draught drawn from waters said to flow only in heaven?"
"我到了门口，走进那安静的房子，爬上楼梯。大厅里空洞洞的，没有响动，所有的门都紧闭着。我四处寻找那块整洁的绿色脚垫，它十分规矩地躺在原来的位置。","I was at the door; I entered the quiet house; I mounted the stairs.The lobby was void and still, all the doors closed.I looked for the neat green mat; it lay duly in its place."
"“有希望！”我说了一声，往前走去。“但是我应该更冷静些，不能贸然闯进去直接出现在她面前。”我强迫自己稳住急切的脚步，停在那块脚垫上。","‘Signal of hope!’ I said, and advanced.‘But I will be a little calmer; I am not going to rush in and get up a scene directly.’ Forcibly staying my eager step, I paused on the mat."
"“真是冒失啊！她在不在家呢？会有人在家吗？”我问自己。一声细微的叮当响——似乎是一块煤渣从壁炉上掉下来——回答了我；还有动作的声音——有人在轻轻地拨动着火焰，发出微微的沙沙声音，房间里有平稳的脚步声来来回回地走着。我站在那儿，入了迷，更令我着迷的是，这时又一个声音传入我伸长的耳朵中，回应了我的注意力——那声音极为低沉，像极了在自言自语，使我极为肯定房间里只有一个人。只有一个人在沙漠里或者在凄凉的房间大厅里才会这样说话。","‘What an absolute hush!Is she in?Is anybody in?’ I demanded to myself.A little tinkle, as of cinders falling from a grate, replied; a movement—a fire was gently stirred; and the slight rustle of life continuing, a step paced equably backwards and forwards, backwards and forwards in the apartment.Fascinated, I stood, more fixedly fascinated when a voice rewarded the attention of my strained ear—so low, so self-addressed I never fancied the speaker otherwise than alone; solitude might speak thus in a desert, or in the hall of a forsaken house."

"诵读了一部分这首古老的苏格兰民谣，声音便停了下来。随之停了一会，然后又来了一节，这次是法语，大概主旨可以翻译成这样：","The old Scotch ballad was partly recited, then dropped.A pause ensued; then another strain followed, in French, of which the purport, translated, ran as follows:—"
"“开始我只是密切注意着；","‘I gave, at first, attention close;"

"他便会大发雷霆。”","His anger fiercely flamed.’"
"隔壁房间有一些响动声。万不可让人发现我偷听而受到惊吓。我慌忙地敲门，又慌忙地进去。弗朗西斯正好在我面前；她在房间里慢慢地走来走去，看见我来了便停住脚步。她全身笼罩着暮霭，恰似一团宁静而红润的火光；在我进来之前她正在用诗歌同光亮与黑暗两姐妹对话。第一段诗节是沃尔特·司各脱爵士的声音，对于她来说这种大山里的回音陌生而遥远；第二段诗节从风格和内容看，我觉得是她自己的心声。她面容肃穆，表情专注。她面无笑容地看着我——眼神刚刚从空想中回来，刚刚从梦中清醒。她的衣着简单大方，黑色秀发十分柔顺，安静的房间井然有序；但是——她那冥思的表情，严肃的自立，她对思考的热爱和幸运的灵感——她与爱情有什么关系呢？“没什么。”她温和却悲伤的面部表情回答道。它似乎在说：“我必须培养坚韧不拔的精神，对诗歌紧握不放；前者是我的精神支柱，后者是我终身的慰藉。对我而言，人类情感不会开花，人类的激情也不会发光。”其他女人也有过这种想法。弗朗西斯若真如她认为的那样孤独，那就不会比她数以千计的女性同胞们更糟糕。看看那些死板而拘谨的老处女吧——所有人都瞧不起她们；她们自年轻时便不断给自己灌输顺从和忍耐的准则。她们中的许多人因这枯燥的饮食而变得僵化。自制的思想在她们身上是如此根深蒂固，对她们来说那是一个终极的目标，以致它最终吸干了她们本性中的相对柔软和美好的品质，使她们只能作为苦行的典范而死去，变成一小张皮和一大把骨头。解剖学家会告诉你在这个老处女干瘪的躯体里有一颗心，和世界上那些受宠的妻子或骄傲的母亲的心灵一样。但这可能吗？我真的不知道，不过我更倾向于怀疑。","Something stirred in an adjoining chamber.It would not do to be surprised eavesdropping.I tapped hastily, and as hastily entered.Frances was just before me; she had been walking slowly in her room, and her step was checked by my advent.Twilight only was with her, and tranquil, ruddy firelight; to these sisters, the bright and the dark, she had been speaking, ere I entered, in poetry.Sir Walter Scott’s voice, to her a foreign, far-off sound, a mountain echo, had uttered itself in the first stanzas; the second, I thought, from the style and the substance, was the language of her own heart.Her face was grave, its expression concentrated.She bent on me an unsmiling eye—an eye just resumed from abstraction, just awaking from dreams.Well arranged was her simple attire, smooth her dark hair, orderly her tranquil room; but what—with her thoughtful look, her serious self-reliance, her bent to meditation and happy inspiration—what had she to do with love?‘Nothing,’ was the answer of her own sad though gentle countenance.It seemed to say, ‘I must cultivate fortitude and cling to poetry; one is to be my support and the other my solace through life.Human affections do not bloom, nor do human passions glow for me.’ Other women have such thoughts.Frances, had she been as desolate as she deemed, would not have been worse off than thousands of her sex. Look at the rigid and formal race of old maids—the race whom all despise; they have fed themselves, from youth upwards, on maxims of resignation and endurance.Many of them get ossified with the dry diet.Self-control is so continually their thought, so perpetually their object, that at last it absorbs the softer and more agreeable qualities of their nature, and they die mere models of austerity, fashioned out of a little parchment and much bone.Anatomists will tell you that there is a heart in the withered old maid’s carcass, the same as in that of any cherished wife or proud mother in the land.Can this be so?I really don’t know, but feel inclined to doubt it."
"我走上前，向弗朗西斯说了声“晚上好”便坐下了。我所选择坐下的椅子很有可能是她刚刚坐过的；旁边是张小桌子，上面摆着打开的作业。我不知道起初她是不是完全认出我了，但是现在认出来了；她温柔而平静地回复了我的问候。我并没有表现出急切；她和我一样，也没有流露出吃惊。我们就如同平常见面，老师与学生——仅此而已。我开始翻她的作业。善于观察又乐于助人的弗朗西斯马上到里屋拿出了一根蜡烛，点燃放在我旁边，然后拉上窗帘，在已经烧得很旺的火炉里加了一点新的煤块，又拉了把椅子到桌旁，然后坐在我的右手边——然而却保持了一定距离。最上面的的作业是一位严肃的法国作家的英文翻译作品，但是下面一沓纸上却是诗歌。我正准备去拿。弗朗西斯半起身，想要把被没收的赃物拿回去，说那不是什么东西——只是抄诗而已。我决心不顾她的反抗，因为我知道她从不会坚持很久，但是这一次她的手紧紧地捂着那张纸。我只得轻轻地松开它们。我一碰到她的手，她便马上松开手，收了回去。我真想再去抓她的手，但是暂时克制住了这种冲动。那沓纸的第一页写的都是我刚刚听到的诗句；后面的并不都是作者的亲身经历，而是根据前面那部分构想的。这样的话，既可以防止夸大的描写，也可以训练想象力，而且内心得到了满足。我像前面一样翻译成英语，译文几乎是逐字逐句的。它接着这样写道：","I came forward, bade Frances ‘good-evening,’ and took my seat.The chair I had chosen was one she had probably just left; it stood by a little table where were her open desk and papers.I know not whether she had fully recognized me at first, but she did so now; and in a voice soft but quiet she returned my greeting.I had shown no eagerness; she took her cue from me, and evinced no surprise.We met as we had always met, as master and pupil—nothing more.I proceeded to handle the papers.Frances, observant and serviceable, stepped into an inner room, brought a candle, lit it, placed it by me, then drew the curtain over the lattice, and having added a little fresh fuel to the already bright fire, she drew a second chair to the table and sat down at my right hand, a little removed.The paper on the top was a translation of some grave French author into English, but underneath lay a sheet with stanzas.On this I laid hands.Frances half rose, made a movement to recover the captured spoil, saying that was nothing—a mere copy of verses.I put by resistance with the decision I knew she never long opposed, but on this occasion her fingers had fastened on the paper.I had quietly to unloose them.Their hold dissolved to my touch; her hand shrunk away.My own would fain have followed it, but for the present I forbade such impulse.The first page of the sheet was occupied with the lines I had overheard; the sequel was not exactly the writer’s own experience, but a composition by portions of that experience suggested.Thus, while egotism was avoided, the fancy was exercised, and the heart satisfied.I translate as before, and my translation is nearly literal.It continued thus:—"

"但当你被人欺骗，受人冷落或者遭人压迫时，","But when deceived, repulsed, opprest,"
"一定要回到我的身边。’”","Come home to me again.’ ”"
"我读着这些诗，而后如做梦一般用铅笔在边上做记号，心里一直想着别的事情——想着那个“简”此刻坐在我的旁边，不是小孩子，而是一个十九岁的姑娘；她可能成为我的妻子，我的心里也是这样确定的。我已经摆脱了贫困的诅咒，嫉妒和猜忌也已远去，我们这次平静的见面也是未先安排的。那位老师冷若冰霜的态度也许会融化；不管我愿意与否，我感到冰霜正在迅速融化。我再也没有必要向她投去严厉的目光，因为紧锁的眉头已经舒展；现在可以将内心的炽热表现出来了，可以询问、要求、启发她热情的回应了。在思考这个的同时，我想着，哈蒙峰上的青草吮吸黄昏时分的甘露时，那份痛快也无法和我的感情畅饮此刻的幸福相比吧。","I read, then dreamily made marks on the margin with my pencil, thinking all the while of other things—thinking that ‘Jane’ was now at my side, no child, but a girl of nineteen; and she might be mine, so my heart affirmed.Poverty’s curse was taken off me, envy and jealousy were far away, and unapprised of this our quiet meeting.The frost of the master’s manner might melt; I felt the thaw coming fast, whether I would or not. No further need for the eye to practise a hard look, for the brow to compress its expanse into a stern fold; it was now permitted to suffer the outward revelation of the inward glow, to seek, demand, elicit an answering ardour.While musing thus I thought that the grass on Hermon never drank the fresh dews of sunset more gratefully than my feelings drank the bliss of this hour."
"弗朗西斯似乎很不安地站了起来，从我面前走过去拨弄那根本不需要拨弄的火焰，拿起又放下壁炉架上的小饰品；她的裙摆就在离我一码内的地方飘动着，她苗条，挺拔，优雅，笔直地站在壁炉边。","Frances rose as if restless; she passed before me to stir the fire, which did not want stirring; she lifted and put down the little ornaments on the mantelpiece; her dress waved within a yard of me; slight, straight, and elegant, she stood erect on the hearth."
"有些冲动我们能够控制，有些冲动控制着我们；因为它们一个虎跃就跳过来了，在我们尚未意识到之前，成了我们的主人。尽管也许这种冲动并非坏事，也许理智已在不知不觉间迅速无声地确定了这种行为并无过错，并认为当事情发生时最好让它保持冷静。我知道我没有想那么多，没有计划和思量；我只是前一刻还独自坐在桌边的椅子上，下一刻便将弗朗西斯快速而果断地抱在膝上，极为固执地保持着这个姿势。","There are impulses we can control, but there are others which control us, because they attain us with a tiger leap, and are our masters ere we have seen them.Perhaps, though, such impulses are seldom altogether bad; perhaps reason, by a process as brief as quiet, a process that is finished ere felt, has ascertained the sanity of the deed instinct meditates, and feels justified in remaining passive while it is performed.I know I did not reason, I did not plan or intend; yet, whereas one moment I was sitting solus on the chair near the table, the next I held Frances on my knee, placed there with sharpness and decision, and retained with exceeding tenacity."
"“先生！”弗朗西斯喊道，但一动不动。她也没有再说别的话。开头一阵子她似乎被我的举动吓到了；但这种惊愕很快便平息下来。她既没有恐惧也没有生气。毕竟她也只是比以前离我——一个她一直尊敬信赖的人——更近了一些而已。尴尬本会使她反抗，但反抗亦是徒劳，她的自尊心便使她不再反抗。","‘Monsieur!’ cried Frances, and was still.Not another word escaped her lips.Sorely confounded she seemed during the lapse of the first few moments; but the amazement soon subsided.Terror did not succeed, nor fury.After all, she was only a little nearer than she had ever been before to one she habitually respected and trusted.Embarrassment might have impelled her to contend, but self-respect checked resistance where resistance was useless."
"“弗朗西斯，你对我有多少关心？”我问道。她没有回答；眼下的情况太新奇、太意外了，她说不出话来。基于这种考虑，我强迫自己忍受了几秒她的沉默，尽管心里已经迫不及待。不久我又问了一遍同样的问题，这次语调大概不是很平静。她看了看我。我的脸色无疑已经不再镇静，我的双眼也不再是两口平静的井水。","‘Frances, how much regard have you for me?’ was my demand.No answer; the situation was yet too new and surprising to permit speech.On this consideration I compelled myself for some seconds to tolerate her silence, though impatient of it. Presently I repeated the same question, probably not in the calmest of tones.She looked at me.My face, doubtless, was no model of composure, my eyes no still wells of tranquillity."
"“说话，”我催促着；她用很低沉而急切，但又有些调皮的声音说：","‘Do speak,’ I urged; and a very low, hurried, yet still arch voice said,—"
"“先生，您弄疼我了，抓我右手能不能松一点。”","‘Monsieur, vous me faites mal; de grace lachez un peu ma main droite.’"
"事实上，我才意识到我正抓着她的“右手”，而且抓得太紧了。抓紧她是因为想这样做；然后我更加温和地问了第三遍：","In truth I became aware that I was holding the said ‘main droite’ in a somewhat ruthless grasp.I did as desired, and, for the third time, asked more gently,—"
"“弗朗西斯，你对我有多少关心？”","‘Frances, how much regard have you for me?’"
"“老师，很多很多。”她如实地回答。","‘Mon maitre, j’en ai beaucoup,’ was the truthful rejoinder,"
"“弗朗西斯，那有没有多到可以让你做我的妻子？接受我当你的丈夫？”","‘Frances, have you enough to give yourself to me as my wife? to accept me as your husband?’"
"我感到她的心在震颤；我看见她的脸颊上、两鬓处、颈脖上都泛起了“爱情的紫光”。我想从她的眼睛读出点什么，但是她的眼睛被长长的睫毛和眼睑遮住了。","I felt the agitation of the heart; I saw ‘the purple light of love’ cast its glowing reflection on cheeks, temples, neck.I desired to consult the eye, but sheltering lash and lid forbade."
"“先生，”终于她温柔地说，“先生是不是想知道我是否同意——就是，我是否愿意和他结婚？“","‘Monsieur,’ said the soft voice at last—‘monsieur desire savoir si je consens—si, enfin, si je veux me marier avec lui?’"
"“正是。”","‘Justement.’"
"“先生会不会像他是一个好老师那样，是一个好丈夫呢？”","‘Monsieur sera-t-il aussi bon mari qu’il a ete bon maitre?’"
"“我会尽力的，弗朗西斯。”","‘I will try, Frances.’"
"她停了一会，又用一种清新但是很柔和的声调，一种有点挑衅又使我很开心的语调，——还伴随着一个调皮而害羞的微笑，那微笑与语调简直浑然天成：","A pause; then with a new yet still subdued inflection of the voice an inflection which provoked while it pleased me—accompanied, too, by a ‘sourire a la fois fin et timide’ in perfect harmony with the tone,—"
"“也就是说，先生以后还是会有点固执、严厉、任性——”","‘C’est a dire, monsieur sera toujours un peu entete, exigeant, volontaire—’"
"“我一直是这样的吗，弗朗西斯？”","‘Have I been so, Frances?’"
"“是的，这个您很清楚。”","‘Mais oui; vous le savez bien.’"
"“我就没有其他什么了吗？”","‘Have I been nothing else?’"
"“有的，您一直是我最好的朋友。”","‘Mais oui; vous avez ete mon meilleur ami.’"
"“那么弗朗西斯，你对我呢？”","‘And what, Frances, are you to me?’"
"“我是您忠实的学生，全心全意爱着你。”","‘Votre devouee eleve, qui vous aime de tout son coeur.’"
"“我的学生会愿意与我共度余生吗？用英语说，弗朗西斯。”","‘Will my pupil consent to pass her life with me?Speak English now, Frances.’"
"她思忖了一会儿。然后慢慢地这样回答道：","Some moments were taken for reflection.The answer, pronounced slowly, ran thus,—"
"“您总是让我很幸福。我喜欢听您说话，我喜欢看着您，我喜欢在您身旁。我认为您非常好，非常出众。我知道您对那些粗心懒惰的人很严厉，但是对于那些专心勤奋的人很和善，即使他们不是天生聪慧。老师，我很乐意永远和您在一起，”她动了一下，似乎想要靠在我身上，但又克制住自己，只是诚恳地强调补充说，“先生，我愿意与您共度余生。”","‘You have always made me happy.I like to hear you speak; I like to see you; I like to be near you.I believe you are very good, and very superior.I know you are stern to those who are careless and idle, but you are kind, very kind to the attentive and industrious, even if they are not clever.Master, I should be glad to live with you always;’ and she made a sort of movement as if she would have clung to me, but restraining herself, she only added with earnest emphasis, ‘Master, I consent to pass my life with you.’"
"“太好了，弗朗西斯。”","‘Very well, Frances.’"
"我将她拉近我的怀中，第一次亲吻了她的嘴唇，由此在我们刚确立的契约上盖上印章。随后我们都沉默了，沉默了很久。我不知道弗朗西斯在此期间想些什么，我也不想去猜，我既没有去留意她的面部表情，也没有打扰她镇静的状态。我希望她能感觉到我所感到的平静。事实上我的手臂还抱着她，但是我克制着抱得很轻，只要她不反抗我就不会抱得更紧。炽烈的火焰在我的凝视中燃烧着；我的心在测量着自己的满足感，它测了又测，发现这种满足深不见底。","I drew her a little nearer to my heart; I took a first kiss from her lips, thereby sealing the compact now framed between us. Afterwards she and I were silent, nor was our silence brief. Frances’ thoughts during this interval I know not, nor did I attempt to guess them; I was not occupied in searching her countenance, nor in otherwise troubling her composure.The peace I felt I wished her to feel.My arm, it is true, still detained her, but with a restraint that was gentle enough, so long as no opposition tightened it.My gaze was on the red fire, my heart was measuring its own content; it sounded and sounded, and found the depth fathomless."
"“先生。”我安静的同伴终于说话了，她沉浸在幸福之中一动不动，就像是一只被吓着的老鼠。即使现在说话的时候她也几乎没有抬头。","‘Monsieur,’ at last said my quiet companion, as stirless in her happiness as a mouse in its terror.Even now in speaking she scarcely lifted her head."
"“怎么了，弗朗西斯？”我喜欢不言过其实的交流；我这个人不会用含情脉脉的称呼将对方压倒，也不喜欢自私地用缠绵不休的亲吻让人烦恼。","‘Well, Frances?’ I like unexaggerated intercourse; it is not my way to overpower with amorous epithets, any more than to worry with selfishly importunate caresses."
"“先生是通情达理的人，是吧？”","‘Monsieur est raisonnable, n’est-ce pas?’"
"“是的，若你这话用英语来说，我会更加通情达理。为什么这样问？你看我处事并没有什么过于猛烈或者冒失的吧，我难道还不够沉稳吗？”","‘Yes, especially when I am requested to be so in English.But why do you ask me?You see nothing vehement or obtrusive in my manner; am I not tranquil enough?’"
"“我不是那个意思——”弗朗西斯开始说。","‘Ce n’est pas cela—’began Frances."
"“说英语！”我提醒她。","‘English!’ I reminded her."
"“好的，先生，我只是想说，我当然还是希望继续当教师。我想您也会继续当教师，是吧，先生？”","‘Well, monsieur, I wished merely to say that I should like, of course, to retain my employment of teaching.You will teach still, I suppose, monsieur?’"
"“哦，是的；我全靠那个谋生。”","‘Oh yes; it is all I have to depend on.’"
"“Bon——我的意思是好。那我们就拥有同样的职业了。我喜欢这样；那我就可以像您一样无所顾忌地努力干下去了——是不是啊，先生？”","‘Bon—I mean good.Thus we shall have both the same profession.I like that; and my efforts to get on will be as unrestrained as yours—will they not, monsieur?’"
"“你在制定不依靠我的计划。”我说。","‘You are laying plans to be independent of me,’ said I."
"“是的，先生；我决不能成为您的累赘——无论如何都不能成为您的负担。”","‘Yes, monsieur; I must be no encumbrance to you—no burden in any way.’"
"“但是，弗朗西斯，我还没有告诉你我目前的情况呢。我已经离开了珀莱先生的学校，经过将近一个月的寻找，我得到了另一份差事，年薪三千法郎，只要我在外面稍微兼职就可以轻松地将这个数目翻倍。你看，这样你就没必要那么辛苦地出去教课了；每年六千法郎足够我们过活 ，而且会活得很好。”","‘But, Frances, I have not yet told you what my prospects are. I have left M. Pelet’s; and after nearly a month’s seeking I have got another place, with a salary of three thousand francs a year, which I can easily double by a little additional exertion.Thus you see it would be useless for you to fag yourself by going out to give lessons; on six thousand francs you and I can live, and live well.’"
"弗朗西斯似乎在考虑。男人只要一想到能够成为自己所爱之人的依靠——为她提供衣食住行，如同上帝培育田地里的百合，就会想要夸耀自己的能力，这与他高贵的骄傲一脉相承。于是，为了使她下定决心，我接着说道：","Frances seemed to consider.There is something flattering to man’s strength, something consonant to his honourable pride, in the idea of becoming the providence of what he loves—feeding and clothing it, as God does the lilies of the field.So, to decide her resolution, I went on,—"
"“这么多年来你过得太艰辛、太吃力了，弗朗西斯，你应该彻底地休息一下。你年薪一千两百法郎对我们的收入并不是很重要，而且为了挣那些钱得牺牲多少享乐的时光啊！辞掉你的工作吧——你肯定很疲倦了——就让我享受一下供养你休息的幸福吧。”","‘Life has been painful and laborious enough to you so far, Frances; you require complete rest.Your twelve hundred francs would not form a very important addition to our income, and what sacrifice of comfort to earn it!Relinquish your labours—you must be weary—and let me have the happiness of giving you rest.’"
"我不知道弗朗西斯是否对我的长篇大论给予了应有的注意。她没有如往常一样十分尊敬地立即回答我，而只是叹了口气，然后说道：","I am not sure whether Frances had accorded due attention to my harangue.Instead of answering me with her usual respectful promptitude, she only sighed, and said,—"
"“先生您是多么的富有啊！”然后在我的怀里不安地动了动。“年薪三千法郎！”她低声说道，“而我只有一千二百法郎！”她说得更快了。“但是目前应该这样了，先生，您刚不是说让我放弃我的工作吗？啊不！我要紧紧地抓牢它。”她的小手把我的手抓得更紧了，“想想我嫁给您，靠您养活，先生！我可做不到；而且那样的话，我的日子会是多么无聊啊！您会从早到晚出门，在紧闭又吵闹的教室里上课；而我只能在家里，游手好闲，孤单寂寞。我会很快就变得压抑而沉闷，那您不久就会厌烦我了。”","‘How rich you are, monsieur!’ and then she stirred uneasy in my arms.‘Three thousand francs!’ she murmured, ‘while I get only twelve hundred!’ She went on faster.‘However, it must be so for the present; and, monsieur, were you not saying something about my giving up my place?Oh no!I shall hold it fast,’ and her little fingers emphatically tightened on mine.‘Think of my marrying you to be kept by you, monsieur!I could not do it; and how dull my days would be!You would be away teaching in close, noisy schoolrooms from morning till evening, and I should be lingering at home, unemployed and solitary.I should get depressed and sullen, and you would soon tire of me.’"
"“弗朗西斯，你可以读书，可以学习呀——你不是很喜欢干这两件事嘛。”","‘Frances, you could read and study—two things you like so well.’"
"“先生，我做不到。我的确喜欢沉思冥想的生活，但是我更热爱积极向上的生活。无论如何我要做些事，和您一起做事。我已经注意到，先生，那些只是彼此的玩伴的夫妻不会像那些一起工作或者一起吃苦的夫妻那样互相爱慕，互相尊重。”","‘Monsieur, I could not. I like a contemplative life, but I like an active life better.I must act in some way, and act with you. I have taken notice, monsieur, that people who are only in each other’s company for amusement never really like each other so well, or esteem each other so highly, as those who work together, and perhaps suffer together.’"
"“你说得很对，”我最后说道，”你应该走自己的路，因为那是最好的一条路。现在我欣然答应了你，作为奖赏你应该主动给我一个吻吧。”","‘You speak God’s truth,’ said I at last; ‘and you shall have your own way, for it is the best way.Now, as a reward for such ready consent, give me a voluntary kiss.’"
"她犹豫了一会，这对于她这样一个接吻的新生来说是很自然的，她十分害羞地用嘴唇轻触了我的额头。我接受了这份小礼物，作为一笔债，并马上偿还了她，而且带着丰厚的利息。","After some hesitation, natural to a novice in the art of kissing, she brought her lips into very shy and gentle contact with my forehead.I took the small gift as a loan, and repaid it promptly, and with generous interest."
"我不知道自从我第一次见到弗朗西斯以来，她是不是真的改变了很多；但是当我现在看着她时，我感觉她确实为我一人改变了。我所记得的她的早先特征——悲伤的眼神，苍白的面颊，沮丧寡欢的面容——都已荡然无存，如今我看到的是一张充满魅力的面孔：浅笑，酒窝，玫瑰般的气色软化了她的轮廓，使她光艳照人。我习惯在内心酝酿一个讨人喜欢的想法，认为我对她的强烈爱慕是我本性中的某种特殊的洞察力。她不漂亮，也没有钱，甚至毫无才艺，但是她是我生命中的珍宝。那样的话我肯定是眼光独到了。今晚我终于睁开眼睛，看到自己犯下的错误了；我开始怀疑只是因为我品位独特，而不是慧眼识珠，才能够欣赏那种精神情操胜过肉体的魅力。对我而言弗朗西斯也是有肉体魅力的。她身上没有什么残缺，眼睛、牙齿、肤色、以及体型都没有显著的缺陷——那些缺陷，会让即便是最为拥护女性“智力美”的男人退避三舍(因为女人会爱上一个丑八怪，只要他有才华）。如果她是个“没牙齿的老太婆，近视眼，又是个麻子或者驼背”，那我对她的感情也许仍然会很和善，但是决不会为她神魂颠倒。我对可怜的畸形的小西尔薇有同情心，但是我永远不会对她有爱情。确实，一开始吸引我的是弗朗西斯的精神，这也一直是我最喜爱的一点；但是我同样喜欢她外优雅的外表。当我凝视她那清澈的棕色双瞳，光滑细腻的皮肤，整齐洁白的牙齿，凹凸有致的身材，便会有一种纯感官的享受——那种享受我至今都无法舍弃。这样看来，我也是个好色之徒，一个适度而挑剔的好色之徒。","I know not whether Frances was really much altered since the time I first saw her; but as I looked at her now, I felt that she was singularly changed for me.The sad eye, the pale cheek, the dejected and joyless countenance I remembered as her early attributes were quite gone, and now I saw a face dressed in graces; smile, dimple, and rosy tint rounded its contours and brightened its hues.I had been accustomed to nurse a flattering idea that my strong attachment to her proved some particular perspicacity in my nature.She was not handsome, she was not rich, she was not even accomplished, yet was she my life’s treasure.I must, then, be a man of peculiar discernment.To-night my eyes opened on the mistake I had made; I began to suspect that it was only my tastes which were unique, not my power of discovering and appreciating the superiority of moral worth over physical charms.For me Frances had physical charms.In her there was no deformity to get over, none of those prominent defects of eyes, teeth, complexion, shape, which hold at bay the admiration of the boldest male champions of intellect (for women can love a downright ugly man if he be but talented).Had she been either ‘edentee, myope, rugueuse, ou bossue,’ my feelings towards her might still have been kindly, but they could never have been impassioned.I had affection for the poor little misshapen Sylvie, but for her I could never have had love.It is true Frances’ mental points had been the first to interest me, and they still retained the strongest hold on my preference; but I liked the graces of her person too.I derived a pleasure, purely material, from contemplating the clearness of her brown eyes, the fairness of her fine skin, the purity of her well-set teeth, the proportion of her delicate form; and that pleasure I could ill have dispensed with.It appeared, then, that I too was a sensualist, in my temperate and fastidious way."
"现在，读者们，在上两页里我一直为你们奉献新鲜的花蜜，但是你不能完全靠着如此甘甜的食物生活；那就先尝一点胆汁吧——只尝一滴，就当换换口味。","Now, reader, during the last two pages I have been giving you honey fresh from flowers, but you must not live entirely on food so luscious; taste, then, a little gall—just a drop, by way of change."
"我回到住处的时候，已经有点晚了。因为暂时忘了人们还要操心吃喝之类令人讨厌的事情，我空着肚子上床了。我一整天都很激动，一直忙碌着，从那天早上八点一直没有吃东西；此外，在那之前的两个星期，我的身心都没有得到休息。过去的几个小时我一直处于甜蜜的狂热状态，至今未能平静；直到半夜很久之后这种烦人的狂喜仍然干扰着我急需的睡眠。最终，我睡着了，但是没有睡很久；当我醒来时天还很黑，我就像约伯一样，被面前晃过的幽灵惊醒，我像他一样也是“不寒而栗”。我可以把这个比喻继续下去，因为事实上，尽管我什么都没看到，但的确“有一个东西正神秘地朝我走来，我听到它的一点响声。在万籁无声之时我听到一个声音，”说着，“活着就是死去。”","At a somewhat late hour I returned to my lodgings.Having temporarily forgotten that man had any such coarse cares as those of eating and drinking, I went to bed fasting.I had been excited and in action all day, and had tasted no food since eight that morning; besides, for a fortnight past I had known no rest either of body or mind.The last few hours had been a sweet delirium; it would not subside now, and till long after midnight broke with troubled ecstasy the rest I so much needed.At last I dozed, but not for long; it was yet quite dark when I awoke, and my waking was like that of Job when a spirit passed before his face, and, like him, ‘the hair of my flesh stood up.’ I might continue the parallel, for in truth, though I saw nothing, yet ‘a thing was secretly brought unto me, and mine ear received a little thereof.There was silence, and I heard a voice,’ saying, ‘In the midst of life we are in death.’"
"那种声音以及随之而来的令人不寒而栗的痛苦感，很多人会认为是超自然的；但是我立即意识到那是一种心理反应。人终有一死，此刻踌躇和抱怨的，正是我的凡人本性——我的神经振动着，发出一种不合调的声音，令我烦躁不安，因为我的灵魂最近一直一往无前地朝着一个目标冲击，使得原本就相对虚弱的身体过度紧张。一种巨大的黑暗恐惧笼罩着我。我感觉我的房间闯进一个我以前认识，但是觉得永远都见不到的人。我暂时变成了臆想症的猎物。","That sound, and the sensation of chill anguish accompanying it, many would have regarded as supernatural; but I recognized it at once as the effect of reaction.Man is ever clogged with his mortality, and it was my mortal nature which now faltered and plained—my nerves which jarred and gave a false sound, because the soul, of late rushing headlong to an aim, had overstrained the body’s comparative weakness.A horror of great darkness fell upon me. I felt my chamber invaded by one I had known formerly, but had thought for ever departed.I was temporarily a prey to hypochondria."
"她曾是我少年期之前的的一个相识——不，我的客人。我曾在一年的时间里招待了她的吃住，在那段时间我和她偷偷地在一起。她与我一起睡觉，一起吃饭，和我一起出门散步，带我看森林里的偏僻角落，还有山上的山洞，在那我们坐在一起，她揭掉那让人阴郁的面纱，戴在我的头上，遮住天空和太阳，草地和绿树；她一把将我整个抱入她冰冷的乳房，用骨瘦如柴的手臂搂着我。在这样的时候她会给我讲那么奇妙的故事！会给我唱那么动听的歌！她会向我描述她的国家——坟墓——并且一次次地向我许诺，不久后就会带我去那里；她将我带往一条阴沉的黑河边上，指给我看对岸大大小小的坟堆、纪念碑和墓碑，它们伫立在比月光还要惨白的寒光中。“那是公墓！”她指着那暗淡的土堆低语，又补充说，“那里有为你准备的府邸。”","She had been my acquaintance—nay, my guest, once before in boyhood.I had entertained her at bed and board for a year; for that space of time I had her to myself in secret.She lay with me, she ate with me, she walked out with me, showing me nooks in woods, hollows in hills, where we could sit together, and where she could drop her drear veil over me and so hide sky and sun, grass and green tree; taking me entirely to her death-cold bosom, and holding me with arms of bone.What tales she would tell me at such hours!What songs she would recite in my ears!How she would discourse to me of her own country—the grave—and again and again promise to conduct me there ere long; and, drawing me to the very brink of a black, sullen river, show me, on the other side, shores unequal with mound, monument, and tablet, standing up in a glimmer more hoary than moonlight.‘Necropolis!’ she would whisper, pointing to the pale piles, and add, ‘It contains a mansion prepared for you.’"
"我少年时无父无母，孤苦伶仃，更没有兄弟姐妹的疼爱；所以当我步入青春期时，这位女巫发现我迷失在朦胧的精神流浪之中，带着诸多的情感与稀疏的目标、热情的抱负与黯淡的前景、强烈的欲望以及渺茫的希望，她便在远方举起幻影之灯，引诱我走向她那拱形的恐怖之家，也就不那么令人大惊小怪了。难怪当时她的魔咒那么有力量；但是现在我的道路逐渐拓宽，我的前景逐渐明朗，我的情感得以栖息，我的欲望厌倦了长期的飞行收起翅膀刚刚着陆在丰收的果实上，充满温暖，十分惬意地躺着那里接受一只柔软手的爱抚——为什么臆想症现在又来引诱我呢？","But my boyhood was lonely, parentless, uncheered by brother or sister; and there was no marvel that, just as I rose to youth, a sorceress, finding me lost in vague mental wanderings, with many affections and few objects, glowing aspirations and gloomy prospects, strong desires and slender hopes, should lift up her illusive lamp to me in the distance, and lure me to her vaulted home of horrors.No wonder her spells then had power; but now, when my course was widening, my prospect brightening, when my affections had found a rest, when my desires, folding wings, weary with long flight, had just alighted on the very lap of Fruition, and nestled there, warm, content, under the caress of a soft hand—why did hypochondria accost me now?"
"我回绝了她的诱惑，就好像所有人都会冷落一个可怕、令人畏惧的姘妇一样，她们唆使丈夫从打心底怨恨他年轻的新娘。一连八天，她夜复一夜地缠绕着我。此后我的精神才开始慢慢地恢复正常，我的食欲也回来了，两个星期之后我康复了。我如往常一样整日奔走，对他人从未提及我的感受；我庆幸那个邪灵已离我而去，我又可以去找弗朗西斯，坐在她的身边，摆脱那个可怕恶魔的缠绕了。","I repulsed her as one would a dreaded and ghastly concubine coming to embitter a husband’s heart towards his young bride.In vain.She kept her sway over me for that night and the next day, and eight succeeding days.Afterwards my spirits began slowly to recover their tone; my appetite returned, and in a fortnight I was well.I had gone about as usual all the time, and had said nothing to anybody of what I felt; but I was glad when the evil spirit departed from me, and I could again seek Frances, and sit at her side, freed from the dreadful tyranny of my demon."
"第二十四章","CHAPTER XXIV"
"十一月的一个晴朗而严寒的星期天，我和弗朗西斯散了很久的步。我们沿着林阴大道在城中漫步，后来因为弗朗西斯有点累，我们便坐在路边树下的椅子上休息，这些椅子间隔排列着，为走累的路人而设。弗朗西斯为我讲述起瑞士的事情。这个话题让她很兴奋；我正在想她的眼睛像她的舌头一样富于表现力之时，她突然停住说道：","One fine, frosty Sunday in November Frances and I took a long walk.We made the tour of the city by the boulevards, and afterwards, Frances being a little tired, we sat down on one of those wayside seats placed under the trees at intervals for the accommodation of the weary, Frances was telling me about Switzerland.The subject animated her; and I was just thinking that her eyes spoke full as eloquently as her tongue, when she stopped and remarked,—"
"“先生，那边有位绅士认识您。”","‘Monsieur, there is a gentleman who knows you.’"
"我抬头看去。三个打扮时髦的男人正从我们身边经过——都是英国人，我从他们的神态，步态以及相貌看出来的。我一眼就认出三人中最高的那位是亨斯登先生；他正在举帽向弗朗西斯问好。随后他就对我扮了个鬼脸，又接着向前走去。","I looked up. Three fashionably dressed men were just then passing—Englishmen, I knew, by their air and gait as well as by their features.In the tallest of the trio I at once recognized Mr. Hunsden; he was in the act of lifting his hat to Frances.Afterwards he made a grimace at me, and passed on."
"“他是谁呀？”","‘Who is he?’"
"“一个我在英国认识的人。”","‘A person I knew in England.’"
"“他为什么向我鞠躬呢？他不认识我呀。”","‘Why did he bow to me?He does not know me.’"
"“不，他确实认识你，他那样就算认识了。”","‘Yes, he does know you, in his way.’"
"“怎么会呢，先生？”（她还是叫我‘先生’；我没办法说服她用别的更为亲切的词来称呼我。）","‘How, monsieur?’ (She still called me ’monsieur;’ I could not persuade her to adopt any more familiar term.)"
"“你没有看懂他的眼神吗？”","‘Did you not read the expression of his eyes?’"
"“他的眼神？没有；他的眼神怎么了？”","‘Of his eyes?No; what did they say?’"
"“它们在对你说‘您好，威廉明娜·克里姆斯沃思。’对我说‘你终于找到你的另一半了；她就坐在那儿，正是适合你的女人！’”","‘To you they said, “How do you do, Wilhelmina Crimsworth?” To me, “So you have found your counterpart at last; there she sits, the female of your kind!”’"
"“先生，您不可能从他眼里一下子看出那么多的；他这么快就离开了。”","‘Monsieur, you could not read all that in his eyes; he was so soon gone.’"
"“我除了那些还看到更多，弗朗西斯。就我看出来他很可能今晚要来拜访我，或者是不久的将来。而且我一点也不怀疑他会坚持让我介绍你们认识。我把他带到你家去好不好？”","‘I read that and more, Frances.I read that he will probably call on me this evening, or on some future occasion shortly.And I have no doubt he will insist on being introduced to you.Shall I bring him to your rooms?’"
"“如果您愿意的话，先生；我不会反对。我想我确实也想近一点地看看他；他看起来很特别。”","‘If you please, monsieur; I have no objection.I think, indeed, I should rather like to see him nearer; he looks so original.’"
"正如我所料，亨斯登先生那晚就来了。他所说的第一件事就是：","As I had anticipated, Mr. Hunsden came that evening.The first thing he said was,—"
"“你没必要开始自吹自擂，教师先生。我知道你被那所学院聘用了，知道那一切；布朗都告诉我了。”然后他便提到自己刚从德国回来一两天；接着他突然问我，他在林荫道上看到和我一起在的人是不是珀莱·勒泰夫人。我正准备竭力否认，但再想了想后又止住了，装作承认的样子，问他觉得她如何。","‘You need not begin boasting, monsieur le professeur.I know about your appointment to College, and all that; Brown has told me.’ Then he intimated that he had returned from Germany but a day or two since; afterwards he abruptly demanded whether that was Madame Pelet-Reuter with whom he had seen me on the boulevards.I was going to utter a rather emphatic negative, but on second thoughts I checked myself, and, seeming to assent, asked what he thought of her."
"“关于她，我马上就会提到；但是首先我有一句话要奉劝你。我觉得你是个流氓。你不应该跟别人的妻子散步。我本以为你还算明智，不会稀里糊涂地卷入这种混帐事。”","‘As to her, I’ll come to that directly; but first I’ve a word for you.I see you are a scoundrel.You’ve no business to be promenading about with another man’s wife.I thought you had sounder sense than to get mixed up in foreign hodgepodge of this sort.’"
"“但是那个女人？”","‘But the lady?’"
"“显然她太优秀了，你配不上她。她很像你，但是要比你好；但并不算是一个美女。不过当她站起来时（我那时回头看到你们一起走开），我觉得她的身材和姿态还是不错的。这些外国人倒懂得什么是优雅。她跟珀莱到底怎么回事？她嫁给他还没到三个月呢；珀莱肯定是个傻瓜！”","‘She’s too good for you evidently.She is like you, but something better than you; no beauty, though.Yet when she rose (for I looked back to see you both walk away) I thought her figure and carriage good.These foreigners understand grace.What the devil has she done with Pelet?She has not been married to him three months; he must be a spoon!’"
"我不想让他再误会下去。我可不想那样。","I would not let the mistake go too far.I did not like it much."
"“珀莱？怎么你的脑子里一直想着珀莱夫妇呢！你总是谈论他们。我真希望你能娶了佐蕾德小姐。”","‘Pelet?How your head runs on M. and Madame Pelet!You are always talking about them.I wish to the gods you had wed Mdlle. Zoraïde yourself.’"
"“那个年轻的女士不是佐蕾德小姐吗？”","‘Was that young gentlewoman not Mdlle. Zoraïde?’"
"“不是的，也不是佐蕾德夫人。”","‘No, nor Madame Zoraïde either.’"
"“那你为什么要说谎？”","‘Why did you tell a lie then?’"
"“我没有说谎；但是你一直都急冲冲的。她是我的一个学生——一位瑞士姑娘。”","‘I told no lie; but you are in such a hurry.She is a pupil of mine—a Swiss girl.’"
"“那你当然准备跟她结婚了？不要否认。”","‘And, of course, you are going to be married to her?Don’t deny that.’"
"“结婚！我想我会的——只要命运再给我们俩十个礼拜。她就是我的野生小草莓，亨斯登，它的甜蜜让我对你那温室的葡萄毫不在乎。”","‘Married!I think I shall—if Fate spares us both ten weeks longer.That is my little wild strawberry, Hunsden, whose sweetness made me careless of your hot-house grapes.’"
"“闭嘴！不要再吹牛了，不要再装腔作势了；我是不会听的。她是干什么的？她属于哪个阶级？”","‘Stop!No boasting, no heroics; I won’t hear them.What is she?To what caste does she belong?’"
"我笑了笑。亨斯登无意中强调了阶级这个词，事实上，他虽然是一名共和党人，贵族的死敌，但他仍像诺曼族人以及征服英国时被授予封号的人的国家里的所有人一样，为自己古老的某某郡的血脉、世系以及体面、世代受人尊敬的家庭地位感到骄傲。就像斯坦利人不会想到跟科布登人结亲一样，亨斯登也不会考虑娶一个比自己阶级地位低的女人做妻子。我很享受自己给他带来的惊讶；我很享受自己的实践战胜他的理论所带来的欢欣；我靠在桌上，抑制住心中的喜悦，慢吞吞地、简明地说道：","I smiled.Hunsden unconsciously laid stress on the word caste, and, in fact, republican, lord-hater as he was, Hunsden was as proud of his old —shire blood, of his descent and family standing, respectable and respected through long generations back, as any peer in the realm of his Norman race and Conquest-dated title.Hunsden would as little have thought of taking a wife from a caste inferior to his own as a Stanley would think of mating with a Cobden.I enjoyed the surprise I should give; I enjoyed the triumph of my practice over his theory; and leaning over the table, and uttering the words slowly but with repressed glee, I said concisely,—"
"“她是修花边的。”","‘She is a lace-mender.’"
"亨斯登仔细地看着我。他没有说他很惊讶，但是他确实很惊讶。他对于什么是良好的出身有自己的见解。我看得出来他怀疑我会草率行事；但是他没有激辩，也没有规劝，只是回答道：","Hunsden examined me. He did not say he was surprised, but surprised he was.He had his own notions of good breeding.I saw he suspected I was going to take some very rash step; but repressing declamation or remonstrance, he only answered,—"
"“好吧，你最清楚你自己在做什么。一位修花边的女工也许可以像一位贵族小姐一样成为好妻子；不过，显然你已经完全考虑清楚了，既然她没受过教育，没有财产，没有地位，她一定有着你所认为极有可能给你带来幸福的天然的品质。她有很多亲戚吗？”","‘Well, you are the best judge of your own affairs.A lace-mender may make a good wife as well as a lady; but, of course, you have taken care to ascertain thoroughly that since she has not education, fortune, or station, she is well furnished with such natural qualities as you think most likely to conduce to your happiness.Has she many relations’ ’"
"“在布鲁塞尔一个都没有。”","‘None in Brussels.’"
"“那还好些。在这种情况下亲戚往往容易坏事。我只能这样想，一大群穷亲戚会成为你一辈子的负担。”","‘That is better.Relations are often the real evil in such cases.I cannot but think that a train of inferior connections would have been a bore to you to your life’s end.’"
"在沉默不语地坐了一阵后，亨斯登站了起来，轻声地向我说了声晚安。他用礼貌又体贴的方式向我伸出手来（以前他从来没有这样过），这个举动使我相信他认为我已经做了一件极为愚蠢的事；并且认为既然我自甘毁灭，自暴自弃，那他就不需要讽刺挖苦或者冷嘲热讽，并且除了放纵与忍耐外也确实别无他法。","After sitting in silence a little while longer, Hunsden rose, and was quietly bidding me good-evening.The polite, considerate manner in which he offered me his hand (a thing he had never done before) convinced me that he thought I had made a terrible fool of myself; and that, ruined and thrown away as I was, it was no time for sarcasm or cynicism, or indeed for anything but indulgence and forbearance."
"“晚安，威廉，”他用极为柔和的声音说道，同时他的脸上露出极为仁慈的同情神色；“晚安了，小伙子。我祝你和你未来的妻子前程似锦，并且希望她能够满足你那苛求的心灵。”","‘Good-night, William,’ he said, in a really soft voice, while his face looked benevolently compassionate; ‘goodnight, lad. I wish you and your future wife much prosperity, and I hope she will satisfy your fastidious soul.’"
"看着他那宽宏大量的怜悯神色，我好不容易控制住自己才没笑出来。而我故作凝重地说：“我还以为你会很想见见亨利小姐呢？”","I had much ado to refrain from laughing as I beheld the magnanimous pity of his mien.Maintaining, however, a grave air, I said, ‘I thought you would have liked to have seen Mdlle. Henri?’"
"“哦，那是她的名字！是的，如果方便的话我很想见见她；但是——”他迟疑着。","‘Oh, that is the name!Yes, if it would be convenient, I should like to see her; but—’ He hesitated."
"“怎么了？”","‘Well?’"
"“我不能贸然闯入她家。”","‘I should on no account wish to intrude.’"
"“那我带你去吧，”我说道。我们就出发了。亨斯登无疑把我当做一个轻率而鲁莽的人，居然带他去那可怜的没有装潢的小房间里见我可怜的小女工爱人；但是他准备表现得像一位真正的绅士，而事实上，他已经领会表演这种性格的精髓了，虽然表演有些粗糙，但他很乐意把它当成精神防水衣穿着。我们沿着大街走着，他说话温和，甚至可以说是彬彬有礼。他一生中从未对我这么客气过。我们来到那栋房子，走了进去，爬上楼梯；到门廊时，亨斯登转身还要往引向更高一层的、更为狭窄的楼梯上爬。我明白，他以为弗朗西斯住在阁楼里。","‘Come, then,’ said I. We set out.Hunsden no doubt regarded me as a rash, imprudent man, thus to show my poor little grisette sweet-heart, in her poor little unfurnished grenier; but he prepared to act the real gentleman, having, in fact, the kernel of that character under the harsh husk it pleased him to wear by way of mental mackintosh.He talked affably, and even gently, as we went along the street.He had never been so civil to me in his life.We reached the house, entered, ascended the stair; on gaining the lobby, Hunsden turned to mount a narrower stair which led to a higher story.I saw his mind was bent on the attics."
"“这里，亨斯登先生，”我边敲弗朗西斯的门边轻轻地说。他转过身来。因为他的恭敬有礼，这小小错误竟使他有些仓皇失措。他的目光又移回到那绿色的踏脚垫上，但是他什么都没有说。","‘Here, Mr. Hunsden,’ said I quietly, tapping at Frances’ door.He turned.In his genuine politeness he was a little disconcerted at having made the mistake.His eye reverted to the green mat, but he said nothing."
"我们走了进去，弗朗西斯从桌边站起来接待我们。她穿着一身孝服，看起来很像一个修道院的修女，但又显得十分高雅。那身简单而庄重的打扮并没有让她显得更加漂亮，却让她显得端庄了许多。那白色的衣领和袖口将庄重的黑色羊毛袍衬托得十分完美；衣服上没有装饰品。弗朗西斯行了一个稳重而优雅的屈膝礼，就像她一直以来那样，当别人先与她说话时，她看起来更像一位值得尊敬的女人，而不是一位值得爱慕的女人。我介绍了亨斯登先生，她用法语说她十分高兴认识他。她那纯正而动听的口音，低沉而甜美又很圆润的嗓音立即产生了效果。亨斯登也用法语应答。我以前没听他说过法语；但他说得很好。我退到窗边的座位坐了下来。亨斯登先生应女主人的邀请坐在壁炉旁的椅子上；从我的位置一眼就可以看见他们两个和整个房间。房间里干净明亮，看上去就像一个擦亮的壁橱；一个插满鲜花的玻璃杯摆在桌子中央，壁炉台上的每一只陶瓷杯里都插着一支新鲜的玫瑰，使得房间里有一种节日的气氛。弗朗西斯表情严肃，而亨斯登先生有些拘谨，但是两人都很礼貌；他们用法语流利地交谈着。他们认真而礼貌地讨论着一些日常话题。我想我从来没有见过像他们两个这样举止得体的模范；因为亨斯登（幸亏他受外语的限制）不得不小心措辞，以防讲出任何古怪的句子。最后他们谈到英国，弗朗西斯开始问东问西。弗朗西斯逐渐地变得活泼起来，就像一个暗淡的夜空随着日出而逐渐变亮一样。起初似乎是她的前额舒展开来，不久她的眼睛开始发光，神情亦渐趋放松，表情变得丰富起来。她暗淡的脸色变得红润而明晰。对我来说她现在美丽动人；之前她只是显得娴淑高雅。","We walked in, and Frances rose from her seat near the table to receive us. Her mourning attire gave her a recluse, rather conventual, but withal very distinguished look.Its grave simplicity added nothing to beauty, but much to dignity.The finish of the white collar and manchettes sufficed for a relief to the merino gown of solemn black; ornament was forsworn.Frances curtsied with sedate grace, looking, as she always did look, when one first accosted her, more a woman to respect than to love.I introduced Mr. Hunsden, and she expressed her happiness at making his acquaintance in French.The pure and polished accent, the low yet sweet and rather full voice, produced their effect immediately.Hunsden spoke French in reply.I had not heard him speak that language before; he managed it very well.I retired to the window seat.Mr. Hunsden, at his hostess’s invitation, occupied a chair near the hearth; from my position I could see them both, and the room too, at a glance.The room was so clean and bright it looked like a little polished cabinet; a glass filled with flowers in the centre of the table, a fresh rose in each china cup on the mantelpiece, gave it an air of fÃªte.Frances was serious and Mr. Hunsden subdued, but both mutually polite; they got on at the French swimmingly.Ordinary topics were discussed with great state and decorum.I thought I had never seen two such models of propriety; for Hunsden (thanks to the constraint of the foreign tongue) was obliged to shape his phrases, and measure his sentences, with a care that forbade any eccentricity.At last England was mentioned, and Frances proceeded to ask questions.Animated by degrees she began to change, just as a grave night-sky changes at the approach of sunrise.First it seemed as if her forehead cleared, then her eyes glittered, her features relaxed, and became quite mobile.Her subdued complexion grew warm and transparent.To me she now looked pretty; before, she had only looked ladylike."
"她对这位刚刚来自那个岛国的英国人有很多话要说，她带着一种求知的激情敦促着他回答问题，这种热情很快便融化了亨斯登的拘谨严肃，就像火暖和了一条被冻僵的毒蛇。我打了这样一个比喻并不算夸大其词，因为他生动的表现使我想起一条从冬眠中苏醒的毒蛇，他挺直了他高大的身躯，抬起他之前稍微低着的头，将头发从他宽阔的撒克逊式的额头拢到脑后，将他那几乎野蛮的讽刺嘴脸展露无遗；弗朗西斯急切的语调和热情的目光不但使这种傲慢在他心中燃烧，也从他的眼神中显现了出来。亨斯登就是亨斯登，正如弗朗西斯就是弗朗西斯；现在，他只愿用自己的母语跟她说话。","She had many things to say to the Englishman just fresh from his island country, and she urged him with an enthusiasm of curiosity which ere long thawed Hunsden’s reserve as fire thaws a congealed viper.I use this not very flattering comparison because he vividly reminded me of a snake waking from torpor, as he erected his tall form, reared his head, before a little declined, and putting back his hair from his broad Saxon forehead, showed unshaded the gleam of almost savage satire which his interlocutor’s tone of eagerness and look of ardour had sufficed at once to kindle in his soul and elicit from his eyes.He was himself as Frances was herself, and in none but his own language would he now address her."
"“你懂英语吗？”这是他的第一个开场问题。","‘You understand English?’ was the prefatory question."
"“懂一点点。”","‘A little.’"
"“哦，那你以后会懂很多。首先我认为你并不比我的某些其他熟人懂得多（他用大拇指了指我），否则当谈到那个叫英格兰的肮脏小国时你不会那么狂热——我看得出来你比较狂热。我从你的神情中看出来，从你的话语中听出来你有恐英症。小姐，为什么只要是有点理性的人都应该对英国这个名字这么有热情呢？五分钟前我以为你是位修女，所以对你极为尊敬；现在我发现你是个瑞士女巫，很保守，也有很强的宗教观念！”","‘Well, then, you shall have plenty of it.And first, I see you’ve not much more sense than some others of my acquaintance (indicating me with his thumb), or else you’d never turn rabid about that dirty little country called England—for rabid I see you are.I read Anglo-phobia in your looks, and hear it in your words.Why, mademoiselle, is it possible that anybody with a grain of rationality should feel enthusiasm about a mere name, and that name England?I thought you were a lady-abbess five minutes ago, and respected you accordingly; and now I see you are a sort of Swiss sibyl, with high Tory and high Church principles!’"
"“英国是您的祖国吗？”弗朗西斯问道。","‘England is your country?’ asked Frances."
"“是的。”","‘Yes.’"
"“你不喜欢英国？”","‘And you don’t like it?’"
"“不是不喜欢，是很不喜欢！那是一个腐败贪污盛行的小国，是可恶的权贵与国王的小国，充满了令人厌恶的傲慢——就像某某郡的人所说的那样——到处都是无助的穷人；这国家已经被不正之风所侵蚀，被偏见歧视所蛀蚀！”","‘I’d be sorry to like it!A little, corrupt, venal, lord-and-king-cursed nation, full of mucky pride—as they say in —shire—and helpless pauperism; rotten with abuses, worm-eaten with prejudices!’"
"“这种情况几乎在所有国家都存在。到处都有陋习和偏见，我本以为英国会比其他国家少一点。”","‘You might say so of almost every state.There are abuses and prejudices everywhere, and I thought fewer in England than in other countries.’"
"“去英国看一看吧。到伯明翰去，到曼彻斯特去，到伦敦的圣贾尔斯区去，亲身感受一下我们的制度是怎样运行的吧。仔细看看我们威风凛凛的贵族们的脚印；看看他们是怎样践踏人民的心灵，如何在血泊中行走的吧。去将你的头探进英国的村舍；看看呆滞地蜷缩在黑乎乎的壁炉边的饥民，看看无遮无盖赤裸地躺在床上的病人，看看无耻行径是如何邪恶地挑逗愚昧无知的，尽管骄奢淫逸是她最喜欢的情夫，高贵的客厅对她而言比寒酸的茅草屋珍贵多了。”","‘Come to England and see.Come to Birmingham and Manchester, come to St. Giles’s in London, and get a practical notion of how our system works.Examine the footprints of our august aristocracy; see how they walk in blood, crushing hearts as they go. Just put your head in at English cottage doors; get a glimpse of Famine crouched torpid on black hearthstones, of Disease lying bare on beds without coverlets, of Infamy wantoning viciously with Ignorance, though indeed Luxury is her favourite paramour, and princely halls are dearer to her than thatched hovels."
"“我想的不是英国的悲惨与邪恶；我想的是它好的方面——是它作为一个国家孕育出来的你的品德中好的一面。”","‘I was not thinking of the wretchedness and vice in England; I was thinking of the good side—of what is elevated in your character as a nation.’"
"“根本就没有好的方面，起码你无法体会；因为你不能充分意识到工业的成果，企业的成就或者科学的发现。你学历有限，身份低微，所以你无法理解这些东西；至于历史与理想化的联想，小姐，我并不想要侮辱你，我认为你提过那些骗人的东西。”","‘There is no good side—none, at least, of which you can have any knowledge; for you cannot appreciate the efforts of industry, the achievements of enterprise, or the discoveries of science.Narrowness of education and obscurity of position quite incapacitate you from understanding those points; and as to historical and poetical associations, I will not insult you mademoiselle, by supposing that you alluded to such humbug.’"
"“但是我只提过一部分。”","‘But I did partly.’"
"亨斯登笑了笑——他十足蔑视地笑了。","Hunsden laughed—his laugh of unmitigated scorn."
"“我确实提过，亨斯登先生。您也是那种觉得联想毫无乐趣的人吗？”","‘I did, Mr. Hunsden.Are you of the number of those to whom such associations give no pleasure?’"
"“小姐，联想是什么呀？我从没见过。它有多长，多宽，多重，多贵——啊，什么价钱？拿到市场上怎么卖的？”","‘Mademoiselle, what is an association?I never saw one. What is its length, breadth, weight, value—ay, value?What price will it bring in the market?’"
"“对任何爱您的人而言，因为产生了联想，您的肖像会是无价之宝。”","‘Your portrait, to any one who loved you, would, for the sake of association, be without price.’"
"那位神秘莫测的亨斯登听到这句话，也感觉某个地方有些尖锐，因为他脸红了——这是他被出其不意刺中痛处时的正常表现。一种烦恼一时之间让他的眼神暗淡了下来，我相信他的对手给了他致命一击之后，在这短暂间歇中，他在想，他也希望有人能爱他，因为他也愿意被人爱——他希望对于爱他的人他能毫无保留地以爱来报答。","That inscrutable Hunsden heard this remark, and felt it rather acutely, too, somewhere, for he coloured—a thing not unusual with him when hit unawares on a tender point.A sort of trouble momentarily darkened his eye, and I believe he filled up the transient pause succeeding his antagonist’s home-thrust by a wish that some one did love him as he would like to be loved—some one whose love he could unreservedly return."
"这位女士趁热打铁。","The lady pursued her temporary advantage."
"“如果您的世界是个没有联想的世界，亨斯登先生，我就不再对您憎恨英国感到奇怪了。我并不是很清楚地知道天堂是什么，天使是什么，但是我能够想象出天堂是最辉煌的地方，天使是最为高尚的生命，假如有其中一位天使——假如虔诚的阿布德尔”（她想到了弥尔顿）——“突然被剥夺了联想的能力，我想他会很快冲出‘永恒门’，离开天堂，到地狱去寻找他的丢失的东西——是的，就在那地狱中，他因为受到蔑视的反驳又扭头回去了。","‘If your world is a world without associations, Mr. Hunsden, I no longer wonder that you hate England so. I don’t dearly know what Paradise is, and what angels are, yet taking it to be the most glorious region I can conceive, and angels the most elevated existences, if one of them—if Abdiel the faithful himself’ (she was thinking of Milton)—‘were suddenly stripped of the faculty of association, I think he would soon rush forth from “the ever-during gates,” leave heaven, and seek what he had lost in hell—yes, in the very hell from which he turned “with retorted scorn.”’"
"弗朗西斯在说这段话的时候语调和她的措辞一样引人注目，当“地狱”这个词带着一种令人吃惊的强调语气从她的嘴里蹦出来时，亨斯登竟然降低身份投给了她一丝赞赏的目光。他喜欢刚强的性格，不管是男人还是女人；他喜欢一切敢于扫除传统限制的东西。以前他从未听到女人用那种强硬的语调说出“地狱”这个词，这声音出自一个女人之口，让他很开心；他十分乐意弗朗西斯再用那样的语气说话，但这不是她的风格。那种古怪的感情流露方式不会给她带来快乐，当碰到特殊情况——一般是痛苦情况下——这种潜藏着的燃烧的激情才会喷涌而出，而且也只表现在她的声音里，或在她的脸上稍纵即逝。曾经有一两回在我们的亲密谈话中，她曾以强健有力的语言向我说过她的大胆想法；但是像这样的时刻一过，我就不能回忆起她当时的那种表现——因为那种表现是自己出现又自己消失的。她对亨斯登的鼓励报之一笑，又回到争论的话题上，说道：","Frances’ tone in saying this was as marked as her language, and it was when the word ‘hell’ twanged off from her lips, with a somewhat startling emphasis, that Hunsden deigned to bestow one slight glance of admiration.He liked something strong, whether in man or woman; he liked whatever dared to clear conventional limits.He had never before heard a lady say ‘hell’ with that uncompromising sort of accent, and the sound pleased him from a lady’s lips; he would fain have had Frances to strike the string again, but it was not in her way. The display of eccentric vigour never gave her pleasure, and it only sounded in her voice or flashed in her countenance when extraordinary circumstances—and those generally painful—forced it out of the depths where it burned latent.To me, once or twice, she had, in intimate conversation, uttered venturous thoughts in nervous language; but when the hour of such manifestation was past, I could not recall it—it came of itself, and of itself departed.Hunsden’s excitations she put by soon with a smile, and recurring to the theme of disputation, said,—"
"“既然英国一无是处，为什么大陆国家都那么尊敬它？”","‘Since England is nothing, why do the Continental nations respect her so?’"
"“我原以为连小孩都不会问这样的问题，”亨斯登回答说，他每次回答都不忘谴责提问题的人是多么地愚蠢。“如果你是我的学生——我猜你曾经是离此不到百里的那个地方某个可悲的老师的学生——我肯定要罚你站在角落边忏悔自己的无知。小姐，你怎么就不明白，我们是用黄金买来了法国人的礼貌，德国人的和善以及瑞士人的卑下？”他残忍地冷嘲热讽道。","‘I should have thought no child would have asked that question,’ replied Hunsden, who never at any time gave information without reproving for stupidity those who asked it of him. ‘If you had been my pupil, as I suppose you once had the misfortune to be that of a deplorable character not a hundred miles off, I would have put you in the corner for such a confession of ignorance.Why, mademoiselle, can’t you see that it is our gold which buys us French politeness, German good will, and Swiss servility?’ and he sneered diabolically."
"“瑞士人！”弗朗西斯听到‘卑下’这个词，立即说道。“你说我的同胞们都是十分卑下？”然后她站了起来。我忍不住低声笑了起来：她的眼睛里充满了怒火，态度也很蔑视。“你是在当着我的面侮辱瑞士么，先生？你以为我没有联想力吗？你以为我只会对阿尔卑斯山山村的邪恶与堕落不能释怀，而不考虑我的同胞们的宽宏大量，我们用鲜血换来的自由以及我们山河的天然壮丽吗？”你错了——你大错特错。”","‘Swiss!’ said Frances, catching the word ‘servility.’ ‘Do you call my countrymen servile?’ And she started up. I could not suppress a low laugh: there was ire in her glance and defiance in her attitude.‘Do you abuse Switzerland to me, Mr. Hunsden?Do you think I have no associations?Do you calculate that I am prepared to dwell only on what vice and degradation may be found in Alpine villages, and to leave quite out of my heart the social greatness of my countrymen, and our blood-earned freedom, and the natural glories of our mountains?You’re mistaken—you’re mistaken.’"
"“宽宏大量？随便你叫它什么吧，你的同胞都是精明的家伙。他们把你所说的抽象想法当做可出售的商品；他们为了成为外国国王的奴仆，在这之前已经出卖了他们的宽宏大量以及用鲜血换来的自由。”","‘Social greatness?Call it what you will, your countrymen are sensible fellows.They make a marketable article of what to you is an abstract idea; they have ere this sold their social greatness and also their blood-earned freedom to be the servants of foreign kings.’"
"“你从没有去过瑞士吧？”","‘You never were in Switzerland?’"
"“不，我去过那里两次。”","‘Yes; I have been there twice.’"
"“你对它一无所知。”","‘You know nothing of it.’"
"“我很了解。”","‘I do.’"
"“你说瑞士人都财迷心窍，就像鹦鹉说‘可怜的鹦鹉’一样，或者这儿的比利时人说英国人十分懦弱，法国人说英国人背信弃义一样。你的看法未免太不公平了。”","‘And you say the Swiss are mercenary, as a parrot says “Poor Poll,” or as the Belgians here say the English are not brave, or as the French accuse them of being perfidious.There is no justice in your dictums.’"
"“可那是事实。”","‘There is truth.’"
"“我告诉你吧，亨斯登先生，我是个很不切实际的女人，但你比我更不切实际，因为你不承认实际存在的东西。你想毁灭个人爱国主义和民族的伟大，就像一个无神论者要通过否定上帝和他本身灵魂的存在来毁灭它们一样。”","‘I tell you, Mr. Hunsden, you are a more unpractical man than I am an unpractical woman, for you don’t acknowledge what really exists.You want to annihilate individual patriotism and national greatness as an atheist would annihilate God and his own soul, by denying their existence.’"
"“你到底在想些什么？你扯远了。我想我们刚在谈关于瑞士人财迷心窍的天性。”","‘Where are you flying to?You are of at a tangent.I thought we were talking about the mercenary nature of the Swiss.’"
"“是的；就算你明天向我证明瑞士人财迷心窍（当然你没办法证明），我仍然爱瑞士。”","‘We were; and if you proved to me that the Swiss are mercenary to-morrow (which you cannot do), I should love Switzerland still.’"
"“那你就疯了，就像三月的兔子一样疯狂，竟然对装满数万亿船泥土、木头和冰雪爱得如此无法自拔。”","‘You would be mad, then—mad as a March hare—to indulge in a passion for trillions of shiploads of soil, timber, snow, and ice.’"
"“我还是没有你疯，你什么都不爱。”","‘Not so mad as you who love nothing.’"
"“我疯得有道理，你没有。“","‘There’s a method in my madness; there’s none in yours.’"
"“你的疯法就是把万物的精华都挤掉，把糟粕当做肥料，把它变成你称之为有用的东西。”","‘Your method is to squeeze the sap out of creation and make manure of the refuse, by way of turning it to what you call use.’"
"“你根本不会思考，”亨斯登说，“你这人完全没有逻辑可言。”","‘You cannot reason at all,’ said Hunsden; ‘there is no logic in you.’"
"“没有逻辑总比没有感情好，”弗朗西斯反驳道，此时她正在壁橱与桌子之间来回走着——我想她心里尽管有些不愿意，但还勉强在行为上撑着待客之道，因为她正在摆桌布，往桌上摆盘子和刀叉。","‘Better to be without logic than without feeling,’ retorted Frances, who was now passing backwards and forwards from her cupboard to the table, intent, if not on hospitable thoughts, at least on hospitable deeds, for she was laying the cloth, and putting plates, knives, and forks thereon."
"“小姐，你刚才的话是在攻击我吗？你是说我没有感情？”","‘Is that a hit at me, mademoiselle?Do you suppose I am without feeling?’"
"“我认为你总是干涉自己以及别人的感觉，武断地认为各种感情都是不合理的，然后强压它们，因为你觉得它们都是不合逻辑。”","‘I suppose you are always interfering with your own feelings and those of other people, and dogmatizing about the irrationality of this, that, and the other sentiment, and then ordering it to be suppressed because you imagine it to be inconsistent with logic.’"
"“我做的是对的。”","‘I do right.’"
"弗朗西斯走出去了一会儿，去了一间小小的类似于食品储藏室的房间。不久她就又回来了。","Frances had stepped out of sight into a sort of little pantry.She soon reappeared."
"“你做的是对的？哼，才不！如果你这样想就错得太离谱了。请行行好，让我到火炉边去，亨斯登先生；我要煮点东西。”（她将一个焙盘放在火上，然后搅动着盘里的东西。）“对！好像践踏上帝给予人们的一切美好的感情，尤其像爱国主义这样的感情在更大范围内传播人们的自私心理也是对的。”（她拨动着炉火，将菜端到炉火前。）","‘You do right?Indeed, no!You are much mistaken if you think so.Just be so good as to let me get to the fire, Mr. Hunsden; I have something to cook.’ (An interval occupied in settling a casserole on the fire; then, while she stirred its contents.)‘Right! as if it were right to crush any pleasureable sentiment that God has given to man, especially any sentiment that, like patriotism, spreads man’s selfishness in wider circles’ (fire stirred, dish put down before it)."
"“你出生于瑞士吗？”","‘Were you born in Switzerland?’"
"“我想是的，否则我为什么会称它为我的祖国呢？”","‘I should think so, or else why should I call it my country?’"
"“那你那英国人特有的相貌和体型从何而来呢？”","‘And where did you get your English features and figure?’"
"“我也是英国人——我的血管里流着一半英国人的血；我有权拥有两倍的爱国力量，因为我与两个高贵，自由而且幸运的国家血脉相连。”","‘I am English too—half the blood in my veins is English; thus I have a right to a double power of patriotism, possessing an interest in two noble, free, and fortunate countries.’"
"“你母亲是英国人？”","‘You had an English mother?’"
"“是的，是的，而我觉得你有一位来自月球或者乌托邦的母亲，因为你对欧洲的任何一个国家都毫无兴趣。”","‘Yes, yes; and you, I suppose, had a mother from the moon or from Utopia, since not a nation in Europe has a claim on your interest?’"
"“相反，我是一个广义上的爱国主义者，如果你能正确地理解我的话。我的祖国是这整个世界。”","‘On the contrary, I’m a universal patriot, if you could understand me rightly.My country is the world.’"
"“散播得如此广泛的同情心肯定很肤浅。您能到桌边来吗，先生？”（她在对我说话，我看起来此刻正借助着月光聚精会神地读书），“先生，可以用晚餐了。”","‘Sympathies so widely diffused must be very shallow.Will you have the goodness to come to table—Monsieur’ (to me, who appeared to be now absorbed in reading by moonlight), ‘monsieur, supper is served.’"
"她对我说话时的语气与刚刚和亨斯登先生辩论时的语气全然不同——没有那么无礼，却更为低沉与温柔。","This was said in quite a different voice to that in which she had been bandying phrases with Mr. Hunsden—not so short, graver and softer."
"“弗朗西斯，你怎么准备了晚餐？我们没打算留在这里吃饭的。”","‘Frances, what do you mean by preparing supper?We had no intention of staying.’"
"“啊，先生，但是你们已经留在这儿了，晚饭都准备好了；你们别无选择只有吃饭了。”","‘Ah, monsieur, but you have stayed, and supper is prepared; you have only the alternative of eating it.’"
"晚餐当然是外国风格的。两小盘可口诱人的肉，做得很精致并且摆放讲究；还有一盘沙拉和一盘法国奶酪。交战双方在吃饭期间只得暂时休战，但是一用完晚餐他们又开战了。这次争论的新题目是关于宗教偏狭思潮，亨斯登先生坚持声称宗教偏狭思潮在瑞士普遍存在，尽管弗朗西斯断言瑞士人爱好自由。这次弗朗西斯没有占上风，并不只是因为她不擅长争论，而主要是因为她自己对于这个问题的真正想法碰巧与亨斯登先生的想法很相近，她纯粹是为了站在反对的立场上而反驳他的看法。最终她放弃了，承认她和他想的一样，但她又让他注意她不认为自己打了败仗。","The meal was a foreign one, of course.It consisted in two small but tasty dishes of meat prepared with skill and served with nicety; a salad and fromage franÃ§ais completed it.The business of eating interposed a brief truce between the belligerents, but no sooner was supper disposed of than they were at it again.The fresh subject of dispute ran on the spirit of religious intolerance, which Mr. Hunsden affirmed to exist strongly in Switzerland, notwithstanding the professed attachment of the Swiss to freedom.Here Frances had greatly the worst of it, not only because she was unskilled to argue, but because her own real opinions on the point in question happened to coincide pretty nearly with Mr. Hunsden’s, and she only contradicted him out of opposition.At last she gave in, confessing that she thought as he thought, but bidding him take notice that she did not consider herself beaten."
"“那这样的话，法国人在滑铁卢也没有战败啦，”亨斯登说。","‘No more did the French at Waterloo,’ said Hunsden."
"“这两件事之间没有可比性，”弗朗西斯反驳道；“我打的是假战争。”","‘There is no comparison between the cases,’ rejoined Frances; ‘mine was a sham fight.’"
"“不管是真是假，反正你说了算。”","‘Sham or real, it’s up with you.’"
"“不是的，虽然我既没有逻辑思维，也没有华丽的辞藻，但是当我的观点确实与你的不一样时我就会坚持己见，直到我无话可说为止；你会被我无言的决心所难倒。你提到滑铁卢！据拿破仑说，你们的威灵顿本来会在滑铁卢战败；但尽管违反了战争定律，他还是坚持了下来，他公然蔑视军事战略，铤而走险，获得了胜利。我也会像他那样做。”","‘No; though I have neither logic nor wealth of words, yet in a case where my opinion really differed from yours, I would adhere to it when I had not another word to say in its defence; you should be baffled by dumb determination.You speak of Waterloo!Your Wellington ought to have been conquered there, according to Napoleon; but he persevered in spite of the laws of war, and was victorious in defiance of military tactics.I would do as he did.’"
"“我猜你会这样做；你的身上很可能也有同样的倔强。”","‘I’ll be bound for it you would; probably you have some of the same sort of stubborn stuff in you.’"
"“要是没有，我会很遗憾的。他和特尔是兄弟，要是哪位瑞士人，不管是男是女，灵魂里没有我们民族英雄威廉的忍耐力，我都会表示蔑视。”","‘I should be sorry if I had not. He and Tell were brothers, and I’d scorn the Swiss, man or woman, who had none of the much-enduring nature of our heroic William in his soul.’"
"“要是特尔像威灵顿一样，那他就是ass了。”","‘If Tell was like Wellington, he was an ass.’"
"“ass意思不是驴子吗？”弗朗西斯转过身来问我。","‘Does not ass mean baudet?’ asked Frances, turning to me."
"“不是的，不是的，”我回答道，“它表示顽强的精神。我看到他们之间又在酝酿一场新的争论，便继续说道，“现在该走了吧。”","‘No, no,’ replied I, ‘it means an esprit fort.And now,’ I continued, as I saw that fresh occasion of strife was brewing between these two, ‘it is high time to go.’"
"亨斯登站了起来。“再见了，”他对弗朗西斯说。“我明天就要动身回那个辉煌壮丽的英国了，也许下次再来布鲁塞尔就是十二个月后或者更长时间之后了。不管我什么时候来我都会把你找出来的，你看着吧，我会不择手段把你激得比龙还凶猛。今晚你干得不错，但是下次你得使出你的看家本领来挑战我。我想这段时间你注定会成为威廉·克里姆斯沃思夫人的。可怜的年轻太太！但是你的思想有闪光点，珍惜它，好好善待我们的教师先生吧。”","Hunsden rose.‘Good-bye,’ said he to Frances.‘I shall be off for this glorious England to-morrow, and it maybe twelve months or more before I come to Brussels again.Whenever I do come I’ll seek you out, and you shall see if I don’t find means to make you fiercer than a dragon.You’ve done pretty well this evening, but next interview you shall challenge me outright.Meantime you’re doomed to become Mrs. William Crimsworth, I suppose.Poor young lady!But you have a spark of spirit; cherish it, and give the professor the full benefit thereof.’"
"“亨斯登先生你结婚了吗？”弗朗西斯突然问道。","‘Are you married, Mr. Hunsden?’ asked Frances suddenly."
"“还没呢。我本以为你可能从我的长相上猜出我是个独身多年的新婚男人呢。”","‘No.I should have thought you might have guessed I was a Benedict by my look.’"
"“好的，不管你什么时候结婚，请不要娶一个瑞士的妻子；因为如果你开始亵渎瑞士或者咒骂它的行政区——最重要的是，如果你同时提到ass这个词和特尔的话，（我知道ass是驴子的意思，虽然先生乐于把它译为顽强的精神）——你的山村夫人某天晚上就会把她的英国新郎掐死，就像你们的莎士比亚所写的奥赛罗掐死苔丝德蒙娜一样。”","‘Well, whenever you marry, don’t take a wife out of Switzerland; for if you begin blaspheming Helvetia and cursing the cantons—above all, if you mention the word ass in the same breath with the name Tell (for ass is baudet, I know, though monsieur is pleased to translate it esprit fort)—your mountain maid will some night smother her Breton-bretonnant, even as your own Shakespeare’s Othello smothered Desdemona.’"
"“我听到你的警告了，”亨斯登说，“你也得注意啊，伙计”（他对我点了点头）。“我还想听到对摩尔人和他那温和的妻子的一段滑稽模仿，按照刚刚描述的计划，角色需要调换过来——而你得戴着我的睡帽出现。再见了，小姐！”他鞠躬吻了吻她的手，绝对地像查尔斯·格兰迪森爵士亲吻哈里特·拜伦的手一样；他还加了一句，“能死在这样的手指下将会是很有魅力的。”","‘I am warned,’ said Hunsden; ‘and so are you, lad’ (nodding to me).‘I hope yet to hear of a travesty of the Moor and his gentle lady, in which the parts shall be reversed according to the plan just sketched—you, however, being in my nightcap.Farewell, mademoiselle!’ He bowed on her hand, absolutely like Sir Charles Grandison on that of Harriet Byron; adding, ‘Death from such fingers would not be without charms.’"
"“上帝呀！”弗朗西斯张大眼睛，耸起她很弯的眉毛，低声说道，“你在恭维我！我可不期望这样。”她笑着，半忿怒，半开心，还向他行了一个外国式的屈膝礼，他们就这样分开了。","‘Mon Dieu!’ murmured Frances, opening her large eyes and lifting her distinctly arched brows; ‘c’est qu‘il fait des compliments!je ne m’y suis pas attendu.’ She smiled, half in ire, half in mirth, curtsied with foreign grace, and so they parted."
"我们一走到街上亨斯登就抓住我的衣领。","No sooner had we got into the street than Hunsden collared me."
"“那就是你修补花边的女工？”他说，“你认为你主动提出要娶她是干了一件高尚的善事？你作为西科姆家族的后代，竟然通过与做工的姑娘恋爱来证明你藐视社会地位。我怜悯你这种人，知道是你的感情将你误导，也知道与地位低下的人恋爱只是在伤害自己。”","‘And that is your lace-mender?’ said he; ‘and you reckon you have done a fine, magnanimous thing in offering to marry her?You, a scion of Seacombe, have proved your disdain of social distinctions by taking up with an ouvriÃ¨re!And I pitied the fellow, thinking his feelings had misled him, and that he had hurt himself by contracting a low match!’"
"“放开我的领子，亨斯登。”","‘Just let go my collar, Hunsden.’"
"他不但没放手，还抓着我来回摇摆；我扭住他的腰。天色暗了，街上孤零零地，没有路灯。我们就这样互相拉扯着；后来两人都滚到人行道上，我们艰难地站了起来，最后彼此都冷静下来，继续往前走着。","On the contrary, he swayed me to and fro; I grappled him round the waist.It was dark, the street lonely and lampless.We had then a tug for it; and after we had both rolled on the pavement, and with difficulty picked ourselves up, we agreed to walk on more soberly."
"“是的，那就是我的修补花边的女工，”我说，“她会终生都是我的——这是上帝的意愿。”","‘Yes, that’s my lace-mender,’ said I; ‘and she is to be mine for life—God willing.’"
"“上帝没有这样的意愿——你不能想当然。你有什么资格配娶这么好的老婆？她对你又很尊敬，总是叫你‘先生’，跟你说话时声调都变了，好像你的地位很崇高似的！如果她有幸被我选中而不是你，我想她也不会对我表现得更尊重。”","‘God is not willing—you can’t suppose it. What business have you to be suited so well with a partner?And she treats you with a sort of respect, too, and says “monsieur,” and modulates her tone in addressing you, actually as if you were something superior!She could not evince more deference to such a one as I, were she favoured by fortune to the supreme extent of being my choice instead of yours.’"
"“亨斯登，你就是个目中无人的人。但你只是看到了我幸福的扉页；你不知道接下来的故事；你无法想象出里面的情节是多么地有趣，甜密而又令人兴奋。”","‘Hunsden, you’re a puppy.But you’ve only seen the title-page of my happiness; you don’t know the tale that follows; you cannot conceive the interest and sweet variety and thrilling excitement of the narrative.’"
"亨斯登说话声音十分低沉，因为我们已经走进了一条比较繁忙的街道——他想让我保持安静，威胁说如果我再自吹自擂让他生气的话，他就要做出令人不快的事情。我笑了起来，一直笑到肚子疼。不一会儿我们就到了他住的宾馆；在进去前，他说道：","Hunsden—speaking low and deep, for we had now entered a busier street—desired me to hold my peace, threatening to do something dreadful if I stimulated his wrath further by boasting.I laughed till my sides ached.We soon reached his hotel; before he entered it, he said,—"
"“不要狂妄自大。你的缝补工配你是有余的，但是配我还不够格。无论是长相还是品质她都达不到我理想中的女人的标准。达不到；我所想象的女人比你那位有着苍白的脸色又容易激动的小瑞士人强很多倍。（顺便说一下，她很像那种疯疯癫癫的活泼的巴黎女人，而不像健壮的‘少女’”）。你的亨利小姐与我理想的女人相比，相貌上不算出众，思想上缺乏个性。确实只有你能够容忍这种小黄毛丫头；但是如果我要结婚的话我一定要找一个更体面更端庄的女人，更别提身材也要比你那位倔强而又命运不济的小丫头更高雅而且有韵味。”","‘Don’t be vainglorious. Your lace-mender is too good for you, but not good enough for me. Neither physically nor morally does she come up to my ideal of a woman.No; I dream of something far beyond that pale-faced, excitable little Helvetian (by-the-bye, she has infinitely more of the nervous, mobile Parisienne in her than of the robust “jungfrau”).Your Mdlle. Henri is in person chétive, in mind sans caractère, compared with the queen of my visions.You, indeed, may put up with that minors chiffonne; but when I marry I must have straighter and more harmonious features, to say nothing of a nobler and better-developed shape than that perverse, ill-thriven child can boast.’"
"“如果你愿意的话就去贿赂六翼天使让她为你从天上取一块木炭，”我说，“用它为鲁宾斯所画的最高挑、最丰腴、最柔软无骨、最有血色的女人点燃生命；就把阿尔卑斯山下的小精灵留给我，我也不会羡慕你的。”","‘Bribe a seraph to fetch you a coal of fire from heaven, if you will,’ said I, ‘and with it kindle life in the tallest, fattest, most boneless, fullest-blooded of Rubens’s painted women; leave me only my Alpine peri, and I’ll not envy you.’"
"我们同时转过身背对着对方。彼此都没有说“上帝保佑你”，而第二天我们之间就翻云倒海了。","With a simultaneous movement each turned his back on the other.Neither said ‘God bless you;’ yet on the morrow the sea was to roll between us."
"第二十五章","CHAPTER XXV"
"又过了两个月，弗朗西斯为她姑妈的服丧期满了。一月的一个早晨——那是新年假期的第一天——我只在范登赫顿先生的陪同下乘坐着出租马车去了内日河畔的圣母大街；我独自下车，上了楼，看见弗朗西斯显然在等我，她那单薄的穿着与那寒冷又有霜冻的明朗天气很不相符。直到今天为止，除了黑色或者暗淡色外，我还从未见她穿过其他颜色的衣服。而现在，她一袭白衣，站在窗边，那白衣的质地最为柔软。她的衣饰确实非常朴素，但显得华贵而喜庆，因为它如此清新、宽松而飘逸。一块面纱盖住了她的头，一直垂到膝盖以下；一顶用粉色花朵编成的小花冠将面纱牢系在她那浓密的希腊式大辫子上，因此面纱柔顺地垂在脸两侧。有点奇怪的是，她在哭，或者之前在哭；我问她有没有准备好是，她说：“好了，先生”，好像在强忍着啜泣；当我拿起放在桌上的披肩裹在她身上时，不仅她的泪水一滴滴不由自主地顺着脸颊往下流，她自己也像一根芦苇似的靠着我颤抖着。我说，我看见她情绪这么低落很是伤心，问她能否告诉我伤心的原因，她只是说：“我就是控制不住，”然后主动，但又有些慌乱地将手放入我的手中，陪我走出房间，摇晃着匆匆跑下楼，就像是一个急于完成一件可怕的事情的人。我将她抱入出租马车。范登赫顿先生接住了她，让她坐在自己身旁。我们一起乘马车到了新教教堂，完成了英国国教祈祷书所记录的宗教仪式，走出教堂时，我们就是夫妻了。范登赫顿先生将新娘交给了我。","In two months more Frances had fulfilled the time of mourning for her aunt.One January morning—the first of the New Year holidays—I went in a fiacre, accompanied only by M. Vandenhuten, to the Rue Notre Dame aux Neiges; and having alighted alone and walked upstairs, I found Frances, apparently waiting for me, dressed in a style scarcely appropriate to that cold, bright, frosty day. Never till now had I seen her attired in any other than black or sad-coloured stuff, and there she stood by the window, clad all in white, and white of a most diaphanous texture.Her array was very simple, to be sure, but it looked imposing and festal because it was so clear, full, and floating.A veil shadowed her head and hung below her knee; a little wreath of pink flowers fastened it to her thickly tressed Grecian plait, and thence it fell softly on each side of her face.Singular to state, she was or had been crying; when I asked her if she were ready, she said, ‘Yes monsieur,’ with something very like a checked sob; and when I took a shawl, which lay on the table, and folded it round her, not only did tear after tear course unbidden down her cheek but she shook to my ministration like a reed.I said I was sorry to see her in such low spirits, and requested to be allowed an insight into the origin thereof She only said, ‘It was impossible to help it,’ and then voluntarily, though hurriedly putting her hand into mine, accompanied me out of the room, and ran downstairs with a quick, uncertain step, like one who was eager to get some formidable piece of business over.I put her into the fiacre.M. Vandenhuten received her, and seated her beside himself.We drove all together to the Protestant chapel, went through a certain service in the Common Prayer Book, and she and I came out married.M. Vandenhuten had given the bride away."
"我们没有新婚旅行。因为我们本就朴素，地位又低下，默默无闻的。这与世隔绝之境倒也惬意，便不再强求那额外的麻烦。我们马上就搬进了我在近郊租的一间小房子，那边离我们俩工作的学校都很近。","We took no bridal trip.Our modesty, screened by the peaceful obscurity of our station and the pleasant isolation of our circumstances, did not exact that additional precaution.We repaired at once to a small house I had taken in the faubourg nearest to that part of the city where the scene of our avocations lay."
"结婚仪式结束后三四个小时，弗朗西斯便脱下雪白的新娘礼服，穿上一条漂亮的、质地更暖和的淡紫色长袍，系上一条可爱的黑色丝绸围裙，又披上一条镶着淡紫色丝带的蕾丝披肩，在这间并不宽敞但布置得井然有序的客厅里，跪在地毯上将我从桌上拿起来递给她的书摆到五斗橱里。屋外雪下得很急；下午成了暴风雪，天气变得很冷；灰蒙蒙的天气好像充斥着雪片，街上的积雪已经深及脚踝了。我们的炉火烧得很旺，我们的新家看起来非常干净明亮，一派新气象，家具都已经摆好了，只剩下一些玻璃器皿，瓷器和书籍等需要整理。弗朗西斯一直到吃茶点时才忙完，之后我特意亲自教她怎么用地道的英国方式来煮茶，看见我往茶壶里放那么多茶叶，她吃了一惊，但冷静下来以后，她还给我张罗了一道地道的英式餐，既不缺糖果又不缺茶壶，既有火光又有舒适。","Three or four hours after the wedding ceremony, Frances, divested of her bridal snow, and attired in a pretty lilac gown of warmer materials, a piquant black silk apron, and a lace collar with some finishing decoration of lilac ribbon, was kneeling on the carpet of a neatly furnished though not spacious parlour, arranging on the shelves of a chiffonier some books which I handed to her from the table.It was snowing fast out of doors; the afternoon had turned out wild and cold; the leaden sky seemed full of drifts, and the street was already ankle-deep in the white downfall.Our fire burned bright, our new habitation looked brilliantly clean and fresh, the furniture was all arranged, and there were but some articles of glass, china, books, etc., to put in order.Frances found in this business occupation till tea-time, and then, after I had distinctly instructed her how to make a cup of tea in rational English style, and after she had got over the dismay occasioned by seeing such an extravagant amount of material put into the pot, she administered to me a proper British repast, at which there wanted neither candies nor urn, firelight nor comfort."
"一个星期的假期转瞬即逝，我们又投入了工作中。我和妻子从一开始就都很用心地工作，我们知道自己是劳苦大众，注定要竭尽全力赚面包钱，而教师这个职业又是最辛苦的工作。我们总是一天到晚忙于工作。我们总是早上八点分别，直到下午五点才再见面。但是劳累了一天之后，我们的休息是多么甜蜜呀！追忆起那一幕幕的往事时，我感觉在那个小客厅里度过的一个个夜晚，就像一长串红宝石盘绕在往昔那昏暗的眉头上。那一长串红宝石颗颗都像打磨过的宝石一样，颗颗都灿烂夺目，如燃烧的火焰。","Our week’s holiday glided by, and we readdressed ourselves to labour.Both my wife and I began in good earnest with the notion that we were working people, destined to earn our bread by exertion, and that of the most assiduous kind.Our days were thoroughly occupied.We used to part every morning at eight o’clock, and not meet again till five p.m.; but into what sweet rest did the turmoil of each busy day decline!Looking down the vista of memory, I see the evenings passed in that little parlour like a long string of rubies circling the dusk brow of the past.Unvaried were they as each cut gem, and like each gem brilliant and burning."
"一年半悄然而过。某天早上（那天是节日，我们不用上课）弗朗西斯突然奇怪地对我说：“我的工作不够。”每当她长时间思考一个问题，最终得到结论时就是这样的。她想用我的判断作为试金石来看看自己的想法是否正确。","A year and a half passed.One morning (it was a fête, and we had the day to ourselves) Frances said to me, with a suddenness peculiar to her when she had been thinking long on a subject, and at last, having come to a conclusion, wished to test its soundness by the touchstone of my judgment, ‘I don’t work enough.’"
"“怎么了？”我从咖啡杯上抬头问道。我刚刚正一边从容不迫地搅拌着咖啡，一边愉快地想着提过的郊游计划，也就是要在那个美好的夏日（当时已是六月）带着弗朗西斯散步到乡下一间农舍去，并在那里用餐；“你说什么？”我立马从她那严肃的神情里看出她有一件至关重要的事要跟我谈。","‘What now?’ demanded I, looking up from my coffee, which I had been deliberately stirring while enjoying, in anticipation, a walk I proposed to take with Frances that fine summer day (it was June) to a certain farmhouse in the country, where we were to dine; ‘what now?’ and I saw at once, in the serious ardour of her face, a project of vital importance."
"“我不满意。”她回答说。“您现在每年赚八千法郎”（这是真的，我工作勤奋，又很守时，学生进步的声誉以及工作的公众影响，迄今为止都在帮助我前进），“而我每年还是那可怜的一千两百法郎。我可以做得更好，我想做得更好。”","‘I am not satisfied,’ returned she. ‘You are now earning eight thousand francs a year’ (it was true; my efforts, punctuality, the fame of my pupils’ progress, the publicity of my station, had so far helped me on), ‘while I am still at my miserable twelve hundred francs.I can do better, and I will.’"
"“你和我工作一样久，一样努力，弗朗西斯。”","‘You work as long and as diligently as I do, Frances.’"
"“是的，先生；但是我工作的方式不对，这一点我很清楚。”","‘Yes, monsieur; but I am not working in the right way, and I am convinced of it.’"
"“你想改变——你脑海里现在已经有了改进的计划。你去戴上帽子，我们一边散步，你一边告诉我你的想法。”","‘You wish to change—you have a plan for progress in your mind.Go and put on your bonnet; and, while we take our walk, you shall tell me of it.’"
"“是的，先生。”","‘Yes, monsieur.’"
"她就像一个有教养的孩子一样乖顺地去了。她就是温顺与刚强的奇怪的混合体。我坐在那儿想着她，考虑着她的计划会是什么样子，这时她又回来了。","She went—as docile as a well-trained child.She was a curious mixture of tractability and firmness.I sat thinking about her, and wondering what her plan could be, when she re-entered."
"“先生，我给明妮（我们的保姆）放了假，让她也出去走走，因为天气这么好；麻烦您锁门，带上钥匙，好吗？”","‘Monsieur, I have given Minnie (our bonne) leave to go out too, as it is so very fine; so will you be kind enough to lock the door, and take the key with you?’"
"“亲我吧，克里姆斯沃思夫人，”我的回答并不恰当；但她穿着清爽的夏装，戴上小太阳帽，看上去十分迷人，而且她和我说话的态度还像往常一样真挚温和，尊重有礼，一看到她我就会心花怒放，必须要一个吻来满足我内心的渴望。","‘Kiss me, Mrs. Crimsworth,’ was my not very apposite reply; but she looked so engaging in her light summer dress and little cottage bonnet, and her manner in speaking to me was then, as always, so unaffectedly and suavely respectful, that my heart expanded at the sight of her, and a kiss seemed necessary to content its importunity."
"“好了，先生。”","‘There, monsieur.’"
"“你怎么总是叫我‘先生’呢？叫‘威廉’。”","‘Why do you always call me “monsieur” ?Say  “William.” ’"
"“我发不出你的W音，而且‘先生’这个称呼专属于你啊，我最喜欢它。”","‘I cannot pronounce your W. Besides, “monsieur” belongs to you; I like it best.’"
"明妮戴上干净的帽子，披上漂亮的披肩离开后，我们也出发了，留下一栋孤独而安静的房子——如果不是钟表的滴答声，房子起码是安静的。我们很快便走出了布鲁塞尔；迎接我们的是田野以及乡间小径，远离了车声隆隆的大马路。不久我们就到了一片幽静处，很有乡土风情，树木郁郁葱葱，与世隔绝，看上去像是英国某个充满田园风光的省份的一处景点；山楂树下有一个长满小草和生苔的斜坡，形成了一个座位，十分诱人，让人不忍拒绝。我们坐了下来，赏玩了脚下的英式的野花后，我又提起了早餐时俩人所谈到的话题。","Minnie having departed in clean cap and smart shawl, we too set out, leaving the house solitary and silent—silent, at least, but for the ticking of the clock. We were soon clear of Brussels; the fields received us, and then the lanes, remote from carriage-resounding chausées.Ere long we came upon a nook, so rural, green, and secluded it might have been a spot in some pastoral English province; a bank of short and mossy grass, under a hawthorn, offered a seat too tempting to be declined.We took it, and when we had admired and examined some English-looking wild flowers growing at our feet, I recalled Frances’ attention and my own to the topic touched on at breakfast."
"“她的计划是什么呢？”如果她想在事业上提升自己的话，下一步自然就由我们，或者至少她自己去攀登了。她提议创办一所学校。我们靠着自己的收入一直过得不错，只要勤俭节约，创办学校的启动资金还是有的。而且此时我们已经有了广阔的人际关系，从有利于事业的角度讲，也有资格办学校了；因为虽然我们所来往的交际圈子还是像之前一样窄，但是现在我们作为教师，在学校以及学生家庭那里已经广为人知。弗朗西斯详尽阐述完她的计划，最后几句话还透露出她对未来的希望。她确信，只要我们身体健康，诸事顺利，我们迟早会办成一所独立的学校，也许不用等到年老力衰时就能乐见其成。那时我们都可以休息了；到那时还有什么能够阻止我们一起到英国生活呢？英国仍然是她的理想圣地。","‘What was her plan?’ A natural one—the next step to be mounted by us, or at least by her, if she wanted to rise in her profession.She proposed to begin a school.We already had the means for commencing on a careful scale, having lived greatly within our income.We possessed, too, by this time, an extensive and eligible connection, in the sense advantageous to our business; for though our circle of visiting acquaintance continued as limited as ever, we were now widely known in schools and families as teachers.When Frances had developed her plan, she intimated, in some closing sentences, her hopes for the future.If we only had good health and tolerable success, we might, she was sure, in time realize an independence, and that perhaps before we were too old to enjoy it. Then both she and I would rest; and what was to hinder us from going to live in England?England was still her Promised Land."
"我没有在她的前行道路上设置障碍，没有提出反对意见。我知道她不是个能够无所作为就活着的人，就算比较懒散也不行。她必须要完成一些任务，而且是重要的任务。她需要有工作做，而且是令人激动、引人入胜而且有益的工作。她的身上蕴含着强大的才能，它们需要充足的营养，并得到自由的发挥。我不会让它们挨饿或者束缚它们；不会的，我很乐意为它们提供支持，为它们拓宽施展才能的空间。","I put no obstacle in her way, raised no objection.I knew she was not one who could live quiescent and inactive, or even comparatively inactive.Duties she must have to fulfil, and important duties;work to do, and exciting, absorbing, profitable work.Strong faculties stirred in her frame, and they demanded full nourishment, free exercise.Mine was not the hand ever to starve or cramp them; no, I delighted in offering them sustenance, and in clearing them wider space for action."
"“你已经构想出一个计划，弗朗西斯，”我说，“一个很好的计划；着手去实施吧。我绝对赞同，只要你需要我的帮助，我随时随地都会帮助你的。“","‘You have conceived a plan, Frances,’ said I, ‘and a good plan; execute it. You have my free consent, and wherever and whenever my assistance is wanted, ask and you shall have.’"
"弗朗西斯的眼眶中几乎充满了感激的泪水，不过只是一两滴泪珠，瞬间便擦掉了。她也抓住我的手，双手紧紧地握了很久，但她只是说：“谢谢您，先生。”","Frances’ eyes thanked me almost with tears, just a sparkle or two, soon brushed away.She possessed herself of my hand too, and held it for some time very close clasped in both her own, but she said no more than ‘Thank you, monsieur.’"
"我们过了极其美好的一天，回家很晚，一轮夏日满月照亮了我们回家的路。","We passed a divine day, and came home late, lighted by a full summer moon."
"如今十年时光已经带着满是灰尘的翅膀不断地扑闪着从我身边掠过——这是繁忙的十年，奋斗的十年，毫不松懈的十年；这十年来，我和妻子施尽全力推行着我们的计划，就像一连串欧洲各国首都的发展计划一样，我们几乎不知道休息，也从不纵情享乐；在我们肩并肩，手挽手的前进过程中，都从未抱怨、后悔或者踌躇过。希望确实激励着我们；健康支持着我们；想法与行动的一致克服了很多困难，最终成功不时对我们的勤劳给予鼓励性的回报。我们的学校成为布鲁塞尔最受欢迎的学校之一，随着我们逐步提高学费，改善教育体制，我们挑选学生也更加苛刻，甚至后来还有来自比利时最有名望的家族的孩子们。我们在英国也有了很好的渠道，首先是由亨斯登先生主动提出推荐而开辟的，他来过一次，臭骂我竟如此顺利地调整了学费，回去之后不久就送来了某某郡的三位女继承人——他的几位表妹；就像他说的，“让克里姆斯沃思夫人打磨一下。”","Ten years rushed now upon me with dusty, vibrating, unresting wings—years of bustle, action, unslacked endeavour; years in which I and my wife, having launched ourselves in the full career of progress, as progress whirls on in European capitals, scarcely knew repose, were strangers to amusement, never thought of indulgence, and yet, as our course ran side by side, as we marched hand in hand, we neither murmured, repented, nor faltered.Hope indeed cheered us; health kept us up; harmony of thought and deed smoothed many difficulties, and finally success bestowed every now and then encouraging reward on diligence.Our school became one of the most popular in Brussels, and as by degrees we raised our terms and elevated our system of education, our choice of pupils grew more select, and at length included the children of the best families in Belgium.We had too an excellent connection in England, first opened by the unsolicited recommendation of Mr. Hunsden, who having been over, and having abused me for my prosperity in set terms, went back, and soon after sent a leash of young —shire heiresses—his cousins; as he said, ‘to be polished off by Mrs. Crimsworth.’"
"至于那位克里姆斯沃思夫人，在某个方面讲她已经变成另一个女人，尽管从另一个方面讲她还没有变。她在不同情况下简直迥然不同，我似乎有着两个妻子。她的天生才干在我和她结婚时便已展现，现在仍然朝气蓬勃，讨人喜爱；而其他方面的才能也在迅速成长，抽枝发芽，大大地改变了她原有的外在性格。之前的倔强好动积极上进，已被严肃的外表以及诗人般的感情和热情所掩盖；但是这些花儿依然生长在那里，在后来成长的有着更为坚强本性的树阴之中保持着当初的纯洁和雨露。也许在这世界上只有我知道它们的存在这个秘密，但是对于我，它们随时都散发着精美的芬芳，展现出光芒四射的高雅之美。","As to this same Mrs. Crimsworth, in one sense she was become another woman, though in another she remained unchanged.So different was she under different circumstances, I seemed to possess two wives.The faculties of her nature already disclosed when I married her, remained fresh and fair; but other faculties shot up strong, branched out broad, and quite altered the external character of the plant.Firmness activity, and enterprise covered with grave foliage poetic feeling and fervour; but these flowers were still there, preserved pure and dewy under the umbrage of later growth and hardier nature.Perhaps I only in the world knew the secret of their existence, but to me they were ever ready to yield an exquisite fragrance and present a beauty as chaste as radiant."
"在白天，我的家和学校都是由这位女校长夫人主管，她庄严而优雅，那宽大的额头上挂着很多思虑，严肃的神情中带有适当的尊严。一吃完早饭我便和这位夫人道别。我要去我的学校，她要去她的教室。我一天就回来一个小时，总是看见她在教室里一心一意地忙碌着——沉默寡言，孜孜不倦，极为细心。当她没有课时，也会监督着，用眼神和手势指导他人；那时她显得警惕而又细心。上课时，她的表情更为活泼，似乎在教书中找到了某种快乐。她对学生说话时语言简洁而不做作，从不会用陈词滥调。她不依常规说话，而是有一套自己的措辞，她说话时经常会出现一些强健有力而又发人深省的句子；讲述历史或者地理里她最爱的章节时，她便会滔滔不绝地认真讲。她的学生们，至少那些年长或者比较聪明的学生们，清楚地认识到她语言中体现的出众的思维。他们也感觉到了她的高尚品德，这给其中有些人留下深刻印象。这位老师并没有溺爱这些学生，但是弗朗西斯的一些学生们后来还是学会真心真意地爱上了她，所有学生都很尊敬她。她对她们的态度总的来说是严肃的，有时当她们取得进步或者认真听讲让她很高兴时，她的态度会和蔼一些，但她总是很谨慎地表现出优雅与体贴。有时当需要责备或者处罚学生时，她总是竭力忍耐；但是如果有人利用她的忍耐不知悔改——这情况时有发生，她就会像闪电一样突然变得严厉起来，让这样的学生知道他们犯的错误有多严重。有时她的眼睛和举止中会透露出一丝对学生的温和之情，但是那很少见，只有当某位学生生病了，或者想家了，或者面对某个没有妈妈的小孩，或者某个比其他同学都要穷的孩子，因为衣着简朴，用具简陋，而受到那些穿金戴银的年轻女伯爵或者衣着光鲜的小姐们的嘲笑时。遇到这些羽翼未丰的小鸟，女校长便会张开最仁慈的翅膀保护她们。晚上她会到她们的床边给她们掖一下被子，让她们睡得暖和；冬天她会照顾她们，让她们总能舒服地坐在火炉边；她把她们轮流叫到客厅里，给她们一些小蛋糕或者水果，让她们坐在火炉旁边的脚凳上，一起享受一晚家庭的温暖，甚至可以说家庭自由，她温和地跟她们说话，安慰她们，鼓励她们，珍视她们，到了睡觉时间就会温柔地亲吻她们，让她们回去睡觉。对于一位英国准男爵的的女儿茱莉亚和乔治亚娜，以及一位比利时伯爵的女继承人马蒂尔德·某某小姐，以及其他各种贵族小姐，女校长会像对待其他人一样关怀她们，像对待其他人一样渴望她们的进步；但是在她脑海中绝没有偏爱她们，对她们区分对待的想法。她非常喜爱其中一位贵族女孩，那是位年轻的爱尔兰女男爵，凯瑟琳小姐；但是那是因为她为人热心，又很聪明，慷慨大方，富有天分，与头衔和地位毫无关系。","In the daytime my house and establishment were conducted by madame the directress, a stately and elegant woman, bearing much anxious thought on her large brow, much calculated dignity in her serious mien.Immediately after breakfast I used to part with this lady.I went to my college, she to her schoolroom.Returning for an hour in the course of the day, I found her always in class, intently occupied—silence, industry, observance attending on her presence.When not actually teaching, she was overlooking and guiding by eye and gesture; she then appeared vigilant and solicitous.When communicating instruction, her aspect was more animated; she seemed to feel a certain enjoyment in the occupation.The language in which she addressed her pupils, though simple and unpretending, was never trite or dry. She did not speak from routine formulas—she made her own phrases as she went on, and very nervous and impressive phrases they frequently were; often, when elucidating favourite points of history or geography, she would wax genuinely eloquent in her earnestness.Her pupils, or at least the elder and more intelligent amongst them, recognized well the language of a superior mind.They felt too, and some of them received the impression of elevated sentiments.There was little fondling between mistress and girls, but some of Frances’ pupils in time learnt to love her sincerely, all of them beheld her with respect.Her general demeanour towards them was serious, sometimes benignant when they pleased her with their progress and attention, always scrupulously refined and considerate.In cases where reproof or punishment was called for she was usually forbearing enough; but if any took advantage of that forbearance, which sometimes happened, a sharp, sudden, and lightning-like severity taught the culprit the extent of the mistake committed.Sometimes a gleam of tenderness softened her eyes and manner, but this was rare—only when a pupil was sick, or when it pined after home, or in the case of some little motherless child, or of one much poorer than its companions, whose scanty wardrobe and mean appointments brought on it the contempt of the jewelled young countesses and silk-dad misses.Over such feeble fledglings the directress spread a wing of kindliest protection.It was to their bedsides she came at night to tuck them warmly in; it was after them she looked in winter to see that they always had a comfortable seat by the stove; it was they who by turns were summoned to the salon to receive some little dole of cake or fruit—to sit on a footstool at the fireside—to enjoy home comforts, and almost home liberty, for an evening together—to be spoken to gently and softly, comforted, encouraged, cherished, and, when bedtime came, dismissed with a kiss of true tenderness.As to Julia and Georgiana G-, daughters of an English baronet, as to Mdlle. Mathilde de-, heiress of a Belgian count, and sundry other children of patrician race, the directress was careful of them as of the others, anxious for their progress as for that of the rest; but it never seemed to enter her head to distinguish them by a mark of preference.One girl of noble blood she loved dearly—a young Irish baroness—Lady Catherine; but it was for her enthusiastic heart and clever head, for her generosity and her genius—the title and rank went for nothing."
"我下午也在学校里度过，我妻子要求我每天去她学校一个小时，这一点她从不让步。她说我那段时间必须跟她的学生在一起，以便了解她们的性格，熟悉那栋房子里发生的一切，她感兴趣的我也要感兴趣，在她需要我的意见时我要能够在一些棘手的问题上提出自己的看法；她一直这样做着，绝不允许我对学生们的兴趣减少，在没有得到我的认定和同意之前，她从不会做任何重大的改变。当我讲课时（文学课），她喜欢坐在我旁边，双手叠放在膝盖上，比在场的其他人都要聚精会神。课堂上她很少和我说话；就是说话时也明显地带着恭敬的神色。她很乐意，也很高兴仍让我在一切事情上做主。","My afternoons were spent also in college, with the exception of an hour that my wife daily exacted of me for her establishment, and with which she would not dispense.She said that I must spend that time amongst her pupils to learn their characters, to be au courant with everything that was passing in the house, to become interested in what interested her, to be able to give her my opinion on knotty points when she required it; and this she did constantly, never allowing my interest in the pupils to fall asleep, and never making any change of importance without my cognizance and consent.She delighted to sit by me when I gave my lessons (lessons in literature), her hands folded on her knee, the most fixedly attentive of any present.She rarely addressed me in class; when she did, it was with an air of marked deference.It was her pleasure, her joy, to make me still the master in all things."
"下午六点钟，我一天的工作结束了。之后我会回到家里，因为家就是我的天堂。每次那个时候，当我走进我们的私人起居室时，女校长夫人就从我的眼前消失，我的小缝补花边女工弗朗西斯·亨利又奇迹般地回到我的怀中。如果她的老师没有像她自己那样持续赴约，如果当她温柔地说“晚上好，先生”时，她的老师没有立即报以真诚的一吻，那她就会很失望。","At six o‘clock p.m. my daily labours ceased.I then came home, for my home was my heaven.Ever at that hour, as I entered our private sitting-room, the lady directress vanished from before my eyes, and Frances Henri, my own little lace-mender, was magically restored to my arms.Much disappointed she would have been if her master had not been as constant to the tryst as herself, and if his truthful kiss had not been prompt to answer her soft, ‘Bon soir, monsieur.’"
"她总是对我说法语，因为她这固执我已经多次惩罚她。我觉得我对她的惩罚手段很不慎重，因为这不但没有改正她的缺点，却似乎还使她变本加厉。夜晚是属于我们自己的；此时的放松对于恢复我们的体力，应付第二天的工作很有必要。有时我们整个晚上都在谈话，我年轻的日内瓦女士现在因为已经完全适应了她的英国老师，因为她爱他爱得太深所以都没有对他心存畏惧了，她对他有着无限的信任，所以她和他已经是无所不谈，就好像和自己的心灵交流一样自由。那时，她就会像和同伴在一起的小鸟一样幸福，她会向我展示她那优良天性里的活泼、愉悦和奇特之处。她也会展示她暗藏的逗趣与调皮的品质，有时她会称呼包括我在内的英国人为“古怪的英国佬”和“反复无常的岛民”来激怒我、嘲笑我、刺伤我的自尊心，她说这些话时带着一种狂野而又诙谐的邪恶，活生生地像一个无害的小恶魔。但是这很少发生，而且这种精灵般捣蛋行径也总是很短暂。她总是用法语攻击我，因为她的舌头能够将她母语的精髓、要点和精致表现到极致，有时在论战中我词穷时，会以一贯的果断对她展开反攻，伸手去抓这个戏弄我的小精灵。可这毫无用处！我一抓到她的手或者胳膊，这个小精灵就不见了；那挑衅似的微笑在她深情的褐色眼睛中消失了，取而代之的是出现在眼睑下温和而尊敬的光芒。我抓住的只是一个让人苦恼的小仙女，怀中抱的是一个柔顺、乞求宽恕的人间小女人。那时我就会让她拿出一本书，读一个小时的英语给我听，以做惩罚。我常常通过这种方式让她读华兹华斯的诗，因为他很快就会让她安静下来。她很难理解华兹华斯那深奥、平静而审慎的思想。他的语言对她来说也不容易懂。她只得问问题，寻求解释，就像一个小孩，像个生手一样，不得不承认我是她的长者和老师。她的天分使她立即就能洞察并且掌握那些思想更激烈又更富有想象力的作家的作品涵义。拜伦使她激动，司各特令她爱慕，只有华兹华斯让她既十分迷惑又很惊叹，并且不敢对他妄加评述。","Talk French to me she would, and many a punishment she has had for her wilfulness.I fear the choice of chastisement must have been injudicious, for instead of correcting the fault, it seemed to encourage its renewal.Our evenings were our own; that recreation was necessary to refresh our strength for the due discharge of our duties.Sometimes we spent them all in conversation, and my young Genevese, now that she was thoroughly accustomed to her English professor, now that she loved him too absolutely to fear him much, reposed in him a confidence so unlimited that topics of conversation could no more be wanting with him than subjects for communion with her own heart.In those moments, happy as a bird with its mate, she would show me what she had of vivacity, of mirth, of originality in her well-dowered nature.She would show, too, some stores of raillery, of malice, and would vex, tease, pique me sometimes about what she called my bizarreries anglaises, my caprices insulaires, with a wild and witty wickedness that made a perfect white demon of her while it lasted.This was rare, however, and the elfish freak was always short.Sometimes when driven a little hard in the war of words—for her tongue did ample justice to the pith, the point, the delicacy of her native French, in which language she always attacked me—I used to turn upon her with my old decision, and arrest bodily the sprite that teased me.Vain idea!no sooner had I grasped hand or arm than the elf was gone; the provocative smile quenched in the expressive brown eyes, and a ray of gentle homage shone under the lids in its place.I had seized a mere vexing fairy, and found a submissive and supplicating little mortal woman in my arms.Then I made her get a look and read English to me for an hour by way of penance.I frequently dosed her with Wordsworth in this way, and Wordsworth steadied her soon.She had a difficulty in comprehending his deep, serene, and sober mind.His language, too, was not facile to her.She had to ask questions, to sue for explanations, to be like a child and a novice, and to acknowledge me as her senior and director.Her instinct instantly penetrated and possessed the meaning of more ardent and imaginative writers.Byron excited her; Scott she loved; Wordsworth only she puzzled at, wondered over, and hesitated to pronounce an opinion upon."
"但是不管她给我读书还是陪我说话，不管她用法语嘲笑我还是用英语哀求我；不管她用小聪明打趣我还是顺从地询问我；不管她饶有兴趣地向我诉说，还是聚精会神地倾听着我说话；不管她嘲笑我还是赞许我，九点的时候她就丢下我——抛弃我。她会从我的手臂中挣脱开，离开我身边，提着灯消失不见。她的任务就在楼上。有时我会跟踪并观察她。她先打开宿舍的门（学生宿舍），从两排长长的白色床边悄悄走过，查看所有睡觉的学生。如果有人还是醒的，尤其是有人在伤心的话，她就会跟她们说话，安慰她们，站在那儿几分钟以确定所有的人都安然无事，之后便调调公寓里那个整夜都亮着的照明灯，然后无声无息地离开宿舍并随手关上宿舍门。然后她又溜回我们自己的房间。房间里有个小房间。她摸进里面。那里面也有一张床，一张很小的床；她一靠近那个小沙发床表情就变了（那晚我跟踪她，观察着她）。表情由严肃变成温和与诚挚；她一手遮住另一只手上提着的灯；身子弯向枕边熟睡的婴儿。那小孩睡得又十分香甜（至少那晚是那样，我相信平时也是那样）；没有眼泪打湿他黑色的眼睫毛；没有发热染红他圆圆的脸颊；没有噩梦打搅他如花蕾般的面容。弗朗西斯注视着他，她没有笑，但是内心里充斥着深切的欢喜，她的脸上泛起了红晕。一种快乐又强烈的感情在仍一动不动的全身上下翻动着。我的确看见她的心脏起伏，嘴唇微张，呼吸有些加快。孩子笑了，最终母亲也笑了，轻声地自言自语道，“上帝保佑我的小儿子！”她又弯了弯腰靠他更近些，用最温柔的吻吻着他的额头，用她的手盖住他的小手，最终站起身离去。我在她之前回到了客厅。两分钟之后她进来了，一边放下已经灭了的灯一边轻轻地说：","But whether she read to me or talked with me; whether she teased me in French or entreated me in English; whether she jested with wit or inquired with deference, narrated with interest or listened with attention; whether she smiled at me or on me, always at nine o‘clock I was left—abandoned.She would extricate herself from my arms, quit my side, take her lamp, and be gone.Her mission was upstairs.I have followed her sometimes and watched her.First she opened the door of the dortior (the pupils’ chamber), noiselessly she glided up the long room between the two rows of white beds, surveyed all the sleepers.If any were wakeful, especially if any were sad spoke to them and soothed them, stood some minutes to ascertain that all was safe and tranquil, trimmed the watchlight which burned in the apartment all night, then withdrew closing the door behind her without sound.Thence she glided to our own chamber.It had a little cabinet within.This she sought.There, too, appeared a bed but one, and that a very small one; her face (the night I followed and observed her) changed as she approached this tiny couch.From grave it warmed to earnest; she shaded with one hand the lamp she held in the other; she bent above the pillow and hung over a child asleep.Its slumber (that evening, at least, and usually, I believe) was sound and calm; no tear wet its dark eyelashes; no fever heated its round cheek; no ill dream discomposed its budding features.Frances gazed; she did not smile, and yet the deepest delight filled, flushed her face.Feeling, pleasurable, powerful, worked in her whole frame, which still was motionless.I saw, indeed, her heart heave, her lips were a little apart, her breathing grew somewhat hurried.The child smiled; then at last the mother smiled too, and said in low soliloquy, ‘God bless my little son!’ She stooped closer over him, breathed the softest of kisses on his brow, covered his minute hand with hers, and at last started up and came away.I regained the parlour before her.Entering it two minutes later, she said quietly as she put down her extinguished lamp,—"
"“维克托睡得好着呢。睡的时候还笑。他的笑容跟您的一样，先生。”","‘Victor rests well.He smiled in his sleep.He has your smile, monsieur.’"
"这里的维克托当然是她的亲生儿子，是在我们婚后第三年出生的。给他取这个洗礼名是为了表示对范登赫顿先生的敬意，范登赫顿先生一直都是我们值得信赖和尊敬的朋友。","The said Victor was, of course, her own boy, born in the third year of our marriage.His Christian name had been given him in honour of M. Vandenhuten, who continued always our trusty and well-beloved friend."
"那时弗朗西斯是我亲爱的好妻子，因为我是她正直而忠实的好丈夫。假如她嫁给了一个苛刻无情，嫉妒好胜又淡漠随便的男人——一个放荡之人，一个挥金如土之人，一个酒鬼或者一个专制的人，她会怎么样——那就是另一种情况了，并且这是我曾经向她提出过的一个问题。她想了片刻后回答道：","Frances was, then, a good and dear wife to me, because I was to her a good, just, and faithful husband.What she would have been had she married a harsh, envious, careless man—a profligate, a prodigal, a drunkard, or a tyrant—is another question, and one which I once propounded to her.Her answer, given after some reflection, was,—"
"“我会试图忍受那个魔鬼一段时间，或者帮助他改正缺点；如果我发现那确实无法忍受并且无可救药后，我会悄悄地突然离开那个折磨我的人。”","‘I should have tried to endure the evil or cure it for a while; and when I found it intolerable and incurable, I should have left my torturer suddenly and silently.’"
"“如果法律或者强权又强迫你回到他的身边呢？”","‘And if law or might had forced you back again?’"
"“什么！回到一个酒鬼，一个放荡之人，一个自私的挥金如土的人，一个不正直的傻瓜身边？”","‘What! to a drunkard, a profligate, a selfish spendthrift, an unjust fool?’"
"“是啊。”","‘Yes.’"
"“那我会再回到他身边，再次弄清楚他的罪恶是否能得救，我的痛苦是否能平复，如果不能的话，我会再次离开他。”","‘I would have gone back, again assured myself whether or not his vice and my misery were capable of remedy, and if not, have left him again.’"
"“假如再次逼迫你回到他身边，强迫你忍受呢？”","‘And if again forced to return and compelled to abide?’"
"“我不知道，”她匆匆地回答说，“你为什么问我这个呢，先生？”","‘I don’t know,’ she said hastily.‘Why do you ask me, monsieur?’"
"我想要一个答案，因为我看见她眼睛里有一种奇怪的幽灵，我想唤醒那个幽灵的声音。","I would have an answer, because I saw a strange kind of spirit in her eye, whose voice I determined to waken."
"“先生，如果一个妻子与她所嫁的人本性不和，那他们的婚姻肯定就是一种奴隶制。所有正直的思想家都会反对奴隶制，虽然反抗的代价可能是痛苦折磨，但是要敢于直面折磨。尽管通往自由的唯一之路是穿过死亡之门，但是那些门是必须要穿过的，因为自由是不可或缺的。那么，先生，我会用尽全力去反抗；当我心力交瘁时，我就会找到避难之所。死亡肯定可以使我逃脱不正义的法律和这种法律所带来的恶果。”","‘Monsieur, if a wife’s nature loathes that of the man she is wedded to, marriage must he slavery.Against slavery all right thinkers revolt, and though torture be the price of resistance, torture must be dared.Though the only road to freedom lie through the gates of death, those gates must be passed, for freedom is indispensable.Then, monsieur, I would resist as far as my strength permitted; when that strength failed I should be sure of a refuge.Death would certainly screen me both from bad laws and their consequences."
"“自愿去死吗，弗朗西斯？”","‘Voluntary death, Frances?’"
"“不是的，先生。我要有勇气撑过命运安排给我的每份痛苦，力争为正义和自由斗争到底。“","‘No, monsieur.I’d have courage to live out every throe of anguish fate assigned me, and principle to contend for justice and liberty to the last.’"
"“我看你是做不成一位耐心的老太太的。现在假使命运只安排你做一位老处女，那你怎么办？你会喜欢那种独身生活吗？”","‘I see you would have made no patient Grizzle.And now, supposing fate had merely assigned you the lot of an old maid, what then?How would you have liked celibacy?’"
"“当然不喜欢了。老处女的生活肯定是空虚单调的，她的心灵因受压抑而空虚。如果我是一位老处女，我会终生努力去填充那种空虚，减少痛楚。我很有可能会失败，像其他单身女人一样劳累而失望地死去，受人鄙视，没有价值。但我不是一位老处女，”她很快地补上一句,“尽管要不是因为我的老师，我可能也是了。除了克里姆斯沃思老师外我不会钟意任何男人——没有任何绅士，不论是法国人，英国人还是比利时人，会认为我可爱美丽；如果他们对我表示认可的话，我想我也会不屑一顾的，现在我已经当了八年的克里姆斯沃思老师的妻子，他在我的眼里是什么样子的呢？他正直吗，值得人爱吗——”她停住了；她的声音突然停止，眼睛突然充满泪水。我们正肩并肩地站着。她突然抱住了我，热情而真诚地将我紧紧抱在她的胸前。她全身的能量都在那睁大的深色的眼睛中燃烧，映红了她那充满生气的脸颊。她的表情和动作就像是得到了神的指示；一个闪闪发光，一个充满力量。半个小时之后，当她冷静下来，我问她那狂野的激情去哪儿了，那激情刚刚使她顷刻间变了一个人，并使她的目光如此勾人魂魄和热切，她的动作如此快速而有力。她低下头，温和而勉强地一笑。","‘Not much, certainly.An old maid’s life must doubtless be void and vapid, her heart strained and empty.Had I been an old maid, I should have spent existence in efforts to fill the void and ease the aching.I should have probably failed, and died weary and disappointed, despised and of no account, like other single women.But I’m not an old maid,’ she added quickly, ‘I should have been, though, but for my master.I should never have suited any man but Professor Crimsworth—no other gentleman, French, English, or Belgian, would have thought me amiable or handsome; and I doubt whether I should have cared for the approbation of many others, if I could have obtained it. Now, I have been Professor Crimsworth’s wife eight years, and what is he in my eyes?Is he honourable, beloved—’ She stopped; her voice was cut off, her eyes suddenly suffused.She and I were standing side by side.She threw her arms round me, and strained me to her heart with passionate earnestness.The energy of her whole being glowed in her dark and then dilated eye, and crimsoned her animated cheek.Her look and movement were like inspiration; in one there was such a flash, in the other such a power.Half an hour afterwards, when she had become calm I asked where all that wild vigour was gone which had transformed her erewhile and made her glance so thrilling and ardent, her action so rapid and strong.She looked down, smiling softly and passively."
"“我也不知道它去哪儿了，先生，”她说，“但是我知道只要有需要的话，它就会再回来。”","‘I cannot tell where it is gone, monsieur,’ said she,‘but I know that, whenever it is wanted, it will come back again.’"
"现在仔细看看十年后的我们吧，我们已经建立了我们当初所希望的独立学校。我们能这么快获得这样的结局有三个原因。第一，我们为此很努力地工作；第二，我们没碰到什么推迟成功的阻碍；第三，我们一有资金要投资，就有两位高深的顾问，一位在比利时，一位在英国——就是范登赫顿和亨斯登——各自在选择哪种投资方面给我们建议。他们的建议都是明智的，而且能够立即见效，结果都很有收益——至于具体收益多少就不用我说了吧。这种详细情况我只会对范登赫顿先生和亨斯登先生讲述。其他人都不会对此感兴趣的。","Behold us now at the close of the ten years, and we have realized an independence.The rapidity with which we attained this end had its origin in three reasons.Firstly, we worked so hard for it; secondly, we had no encumbrances to delay success; thirdly, as soon as we had capital to invest, two well-skilled counsellors, one in Belgium, one in England—namely, Vandenhuten and Hunsden—gave us each a word of advice as to the sort of investment to be chosen.The suggestion made was judicious; and, being promptly acted on, the result proved gainful—I need not say how gainful.I communicated details to Messrs. Vandenhuten and Hunsden.Nobody else can be interested in hearing them."
"账目已经算清，我们的业务联系也已经处理完，我们一致认为，财神不是我们的主人，我们也不愿意一辈子为它打工，因为我们的追求也并不高，我们的生活习惯也很朴素，我们现在有足够的钱活下去，也有足够的钱留给我们的儿子，除此之外手头上还会有些余钱，如果能够通过正义的同情心以及无私的捐助来合理地处理这些钱的话，它们能够用来帮助慈善事业，并给予贫民以安慰。","Accounts being wound up, and our professional connection disposed of, we both agreed that, as Mammon was not our master, nor his service that in which we desired to spend our lives, as our desires were temperate, and our habits unostentatious, we had now abundance to live on, abundance to leave our boy, and should besides always have a balance on hand which, properly managed by right sympathy and unselfish activity, might help Philanthropy in her enterprises, and put solace into the hand of Charity."
"如今我们下定决心展翅飞向英国。我们安全地到达了那里。弗朗西斯实现了她毕生的梦想。我们花了一整个夏天和秋天的时间玩遍了整个不列颠岛，随后又在伦敦度过了一个冬天。后来我们认为确实该找个地方定居下来了。我心里思念着我在某某郡的故乡，我们如今就在那个郡里住下来了；此时此刻我就在自己家的书房里写作。那个家位于一个偏僻幽静又多山的地区，离X镇三十里远；那里碧绿的山坡还没有被工厂排放的浓烟玷污，那里的水依然清澈纯净，那里长满蕨类的幽谷有着很多隆起的沼泽地，保持着自然界最为原始的荒凉景象，满地的苔藓，满地的欧洲厥，满地的风铃草，弥散着芦苇与石楠花的芬芳，吹荡着自由清新的微风。我的房子风景如画，并不算宽敞，有着低而长的窗户，前门前面有一个由格架搭成的门廊，上面覆盖着绿叶，在这个夏天的夜晚，看起来就像一个用玫瑰和常春藤搭成的拱门。花园主要是草坪，由山上的草皮铺盖而成，里面生长着像苔藓一样矮而柔软的植物，各自开满了奇特的鲜花，星星般的小花儿点缀在如刺绣般精致的绿叶中。斜坡花园的底下有一扇小门，打开便是一条如草坪般碧绿的小径，又长又阴凉，很幽僻。春天时这条小径的草皮上一般会长出最早的雏菊，小路因此得名——雏菊路，这也是这座房子的一大特色。","To England we now resolved to take wing.We arrived there safely.Frances realized the dream of her lifetime.We spent a whole summer and autumn in travelling from end to end of the British Islands, and afterwards passed a winter in London.Then we thought it high time to fix our residence.My heart yearned towards my native county of —shire; and it is in —shire I now live; it is in the library of my own home I am now writing.That home lies amid a sequestered and rather hilly region, thirty miles removed from X—; a region whose verdure the smoke of mills has not yet sullied, whose waters still rim pure, whose swells of moorland preserve in some ferny glens that lie between them the very primal wildness of nature, her moss, her bracken, her blue-bells, her scents of reed and heather, her free and fresh breezes.My house is a picturesque and not too spacious dwelling, with low and long windows, a trellised and leaf-veiled porch over the front door, just now, on this summer evening, looking like an arch of roses and ivy. The garden is chiefly laid out in lawn, formed of the sod of the hills, with herbage short and soft as moss, full of its own peculiar flowers, tiny and starlike, embedded in the minute embroidery of their fine foliage.At the bottom of the sloping garden there is a wicket, which opens upon a lane as green as the lawn, very long, shady, and little frequented.On the turf of this lane generally appear the first daisies of spring—whence its name, Daisy Lane, serving also as a distinction to the house."
"它（我指的是那条小径）一直延伸至一个长满树木的峡谷；那片树林——主要是橡树和山毛榉——葱葱郁郁，伸展到一栋很古老的房子附近，那是一栋伊丽莎白式建筑，比起雏菊路的房子大得多也古老得多，这里的财产和房子都属于一个我和读者都很熟悉的人。是的，在亨斯登树林里——因为那些林间空地和那栋有很多山形墙与更多烟囱的灰色建筑都在树林里，——那里住着约克·亨斯登，他依然单身，我想是还没有找到他理想的女人，虽然据我所知，在方圆四十英里内少说也有二十多个年轻女士愿意帮助他寻找妻子。","It terminates (the lane I mean) in a valley full of wood; which wood—chiefly oak and beech—spreads shadowy about the vicinage of a very old mansion, one of the Flizabethan structures, much larger, as well as more antique than Daisy Lane, the property and residence of an individual familiar both to me and to the reader.Yes, in Hunsden Wood—for so are those glades and that gray building, with many gables and more chimneys, named—abides Yorke Hunsden, still unmarried, never, I suppose, having yet found his ideal, though I know at least a score of young ladies within a circuit of forty miles who would be willing to assist him in the search."
"这些财产是五年前他父亲去世时留给他的。在还清用家产抵押的债务之后，他就放弃了商业。我说他住在那里，但是我认为一年十二个月他不会在这儿住超过五个月。他四处游玩，每年冬天有段时间住在城里。每次他来某某郡时总是会带客人来，这些客人经常都是外国人。有时会带一个德国玄学家，有时是一个法国学者。有次他带了一个面露不满、长相野蛮的意大利人，他既不唱也不玩，弗朗西斯断定他有着“一副十足的阴谋家相”。","The estate fell to him by the death of his father, five years since.He has given up trade, after having made by it sufficient to pay off some encumbrances by which the family heritage was burdened.I say he abides here, but I do not think he is resident above five months out of the twelve.He wanders from land to land, and spends some part of each winter in town.He frequently brings visitors with him when he comes to —shire, and these visitors are often foreigners.Sometimes he has a German metaphysician, sometimes a French savant.He had once a dissatisfied and savage-looking Italian, who neither sang nor played, and of whom Frances affirmed that he had ‘tout l’air d’ un conspirateur.’"
"亨斯登请来的英国客人都是伯明翰人或者曼彻斯特人，这些人一副严肃的样子，而且，他们彷佛是由同一种思想串在一起似的，谈话内容都是关于自由贸易的。这些外国访客也都是政治家。他们谈话的主题比较宽泛，像欧洲的进步、自由主义思想在大陆的传播；在他们内心的写字板里，俄国、奥地利和罗马教皇的名字都是用红笔标刻的。我曾听见他们中一些人很有激情地谈论——是的，我曾在亨斯登树林古老的、用橡木装饰的餐厅里亲耳听见他们用多国语言进行讨论，当谈及尊重古老北方的独裁专制和更为古老的南方的迷信行为时，他们这些果敢的人有着一些独特的见解；我还听了他们主要用法语和德语说的许多瞎扯的话，关于这些我就不多说了。亨斯登本人容忍了这些满口胡言乱语的理论家；他似乎与实用主义者是同心协力的。","What English guests Hunsden invites are all either men of Birmingham or Manchester—hard men, seemingly knit up in one thought, whose talk is of free trade.The foreign visitors, too, are politicians.They take a wider theme—European progress—the spread of liberal sentiments over the Continent; on their mental tablets, the names of Russia, Austria, and the Pope are inscribed in red ink. I have heard some of them talk vigorous sense—yea, I have been present at polyglot discussions in the old, oak-lined dining-room at Hunsden Wood, where a singular insight was given of the sentiments entertained by resolute minds respecting old northern despotisms and older southern superstitions; also, I have heard much twaddle, enounced chiefly in French and Deutsch, but let that pass.Hunsden himself tolerated the drivelling theorists; with the practical men he seemed leagued hand and heart."
"当亨斯登一个人在林子里时（他很少这样做），一般每星期来雏菊路两三次。夏天的晚上，他出于一个善意的动机来我们家门廊下抽烟。他说这样做是为了杀死玫瑰丛里的蜈蚣，他暗示说要不是他善意的烟熏法，我们肯定会发蜈蚣灾。每当下雨天时我们也几乎肯定能见到他。据他所说，是时候践踏我内心的要害而让我发狂，或者是通过侮辱霍弗和特尔把克里姆斯沃思夫人心中的恶龙逗出来。","When Hunsden is staying alone at the Wood (which seldom happens) he generally find his way two or three times a week to Daisy Lane.He has a philanthropic motive for coming to smoke his cigar in our porch on summer evenings.He says he does it to kill the earwigs amongst the roses, with which insects, but for his benevolent fumigations, he intimates we should certainly be overrun.On wet days, too, we are almost sure to see him.According to him, it gets on time to work me into lunacy by treading on my mental corns, or to force from Mrs. Crimsworth revelations of the dragon within her by insulting the memory of Hofer and Tell."
"我们也经常去亨斯登树林，我和弗朗西斯都很喜欢去那儿拜访他。如果有其他客人的话，我们就观察他们的性格，这很有趣；他们的对话令我们很激动，也很惊奇。无论是主人还是他挑选的朋友都不会局限于谈论乡土民情，而是谈论大都市，几乎是全世界，自由自在，无所不谈。亨斯登在自己的家中礼貌有加。只要他想，他就会有无穷的法宝来招待客人。他的府邸也很有趣；房间古色古香，走廊像是充满了历史气息，房间的天花板很低，有着一排排长长的亮闪闪的玻璃格子窗，给人一种古代的阴森的、鬼魂经常出没的感觉。他在外旅行时收集了很多古董，都很整齐而雅致地摆放在那镶着板的或者挂着花毯的房间里。我在那里见过一两张画像和一两件雕塑，这都使很多贵族鉴赏家艳羡不已。","We also go frequently to Hunsden Wood, and both I and Frances relish a visit there highly.If there are other guests, their characters are an interesting study; their conversation is exciting and strange.The absence of all local narrowness both in the host and his chosen society gives a metropolitan, almost a cosmopolitan, freedom and largeness to the talk.Hunsden himself is a polite man in his own house.He has, when he chooses to employ it, an inexhaustible power of entertaining guests.His very mansion, too, is interesting; the rooms look storied, the passages legendary, the low-ceiled chambers with their long rows of diamond-paned lattices have an old-world, haunted air. In his travels he has collected store of articles of vertu, which are well and tastefully disposed in his panelled or tapestried rooms.I have seen there one or two pictures and one or two pieces of statuary which many an aristocratic connoisseur might have envied."
"当我和弗朗西斯在亨斯登家吃过饭，度过一个晚上时光之后，他经常会步行送我们回家。他的树林很大，一些树木颇有年月，并且十分高耸。林中有着蜿蜒盘旋的小路，时而穿过空地，时而穿过灌木丛，使得返回雏菊路的道路变得有些长。很多次恰逢满月当空，夜色温和宜人，此时夜莺一展歌喉，隐于楷木中的泉水温柔地伴奏，直到从十英里之外某个小村隐约传来子夜教堂钟声时，树林的主人才会离开我们家的门廊。在这期间，他的谈话很随意，比在白天或者在人多的时候要平静很多，也要温和很多。彼时他就会忘记议论政治，会给我们详述他家的过去，讲述他家族的历史，讲述他自己和他自己的情感——这每一件事他都饶有兴趣，因为每一件事都是独一无二的。六月一个月光皎洁的夜晚，我嘲弄他关于他空想的新娘的事情，问他她何时才会将她那异质的美丽嫁接到古老的亨斯登橡树上，他突然回答说：","When I and Frances have dined and spent an evening with Hunsden, he often walks home with us.His wood is large, and some of the timber is old and of huge growth.There are winding ways in it which, pursued through glade and brake, make the walk back to Daisy Lane a somewhat long one.Many a time, when we have had the benefit of a full moon, and when the night has been mild and balmy, when, moreover, a certain nightingale has been singing, and a certain stream, bid in alders, has lent the song a soft accompaniment, the remote church-bell of the one hamlet in a district of ten miles has tolled midnight ere the lord of the wood left us at our porch.Free-flowing was his talk at such hours, and far more quiet and gentle than in the daytime and before numbers.He would then forget politics and discussion, and would dwell on the past times of his house, on his family history, on himself and his own feelings—subjects each and all invested with a peculiar zest, for they were each and all unique.One glorious night in June, after I had been taunting him about his ideal bride, and asking him when she would come and graft her foreign beauty on the old Hunsden oak, he answered suddenly,—"
"“你说她是空想的，但是你看，这是她的影子，没有实物的话就不会有影子。”","‘You call her ideal; but see, here is her shadow, and there cannot be a shadow without a substance.’"
"他带我们走出“蜿蜒小道”，来到一片山毛榉簇拥之外的空地，抬头就可望见天空。皓月洒下一片光辉到这片空地上，在月光下，亨斯登拿出一个象牙的小画像。","He had led us from the depth of the ‘winding way’ into a glade from whence the beeches withdrew, leaving it open to the sky. An unclouded moon poured her light into this glade and Hunsden held out under her beam an ivory miniature."
"弗朗西斯迫不及待地先看了看；然后交给我——但她的小脸蛋还是靠我很近，想从我的眼神中看出我对这幅画像是怎么看的。我觉得这是一张非常漂亮又很有个性的女性脸蛋，就像他之前说过那样，“相貌端正而匀称”。图像很暗；头发乌黑，既没有遮住额头，也没有盖住双鬓——似乎是随意地向后弄去，好像这种美女不需要，不，应该说是不屑于打扮。那双意大利式的眼睛直视着你，透着自由而执着的眼神，嘴唇坚毅而美丽，下巴亦然。画像的背面镀着金字“露西亚”。","Frances, with eagerness, examined it first; then she gave it to me—still, however, pushing her little face close to mine, and seeking in my eyes what I thought of the portrait.I thought it represented a very handsome and very individual-looking female face, with, as he had once said, ‘straight and harmonious features.’ It was dark; the hair, raven-black, swept not only from the brow, but from the temples—seemed thrust away carelessly, as if such beauty dispensed with, nay, despised arrangement.The Italian eye looked straight into you, and an independent, determined eye it was; the mouth was as firm as fine, the chin ditto.On the back of the miniature was gilded ‘Lucia.’"
"“那是真人画像。”我得出结论。","‘That is a real head,’ was my conclusion."
"亨斯登笑了笑。","Hunsden smiled."
"“我想也是的。”他回答说。“露西亚的一切都是真实的。”","‘I think so,’ he replied.‘All was real in Lucia.’"
"“她就是你想娶却娶不了的女人？”","‘And she was somebody you would have liked to marry, but could not?’"
"“我肯定想娶她，但我没有娶她，说明我娶不了。”","‘I should certainly have liked to marry her, and that I have not done so is a proof that I could not.’"
"他要回现在在弗朗西斯手中的小画像，又收了起来。","He repossessed himself of the miniature, now again in Frances’ hand, and put it away."
"“你觉得怎么样？”他边系大衣的纽扣将它揣起来边问我的妻子。","‘What do you think of it?’ he asked of my wife, as he buttoned his coat over it."
"“我确定露西亚曾经戴过锁链又挣脱了它们，”她奇怪的回答道。“我指的并不是婚姻的锁链，”她又加以改正，似乎是担心他会理解错误，补充道，“而是某种社会的枷锁。她脸上的表情说明她一直在努力挣脱无法忍受的束缚，为了获得一种有力而宝贵的能力，而且她的努力成功了，获得了胜利，一旦露西亚的这种能力得到自由，我肯定它会展开双翅，将露西亚带上高空，高于——”。她犹豫了一下。","‘I am sure Lucia once wore chains and broke them,’ was the strange answer.‘I do not mean matrimonial chains,’ she added, correcting herself, as if she feared misinterpretation,‘but social chains of some sort.The face is that of one who has made an effort, and a successful and triumphant effort, to wrest some vigorous and valued faculty from insupportable constraint; and when Lucia’s faculty got free, I am certain it spread wide pinions and carried her higher than—’ She hesitated."
"“高于什么东西？”亨斯登问道。","‘Than what?’ demanded Hunsden."
"“高于你所追随的‘得体’，让你无法得到。”","‘Than les convenances permitted you to follow.’"
"“我觉得你开始心怀恶意——说的话不着调。”","‘I think you grow spiteful—impertinent.’"
"“露西亚已经踏上舞台，”弗朗西斯继续说道，“你从来没有认真考虑要娶她。你欣赏她的独特，她的无畏，她身心的活力；你喜欢她的才能，无论是哪个方面，不管是唱歌，跳舞还是戏剧表演；你爱慕她的美貌，那是你内心所追求的那种；但是我确定你是不会在她的那个阶层里找个妻子的。”","‘Lucia has trodden the stage,’ continued Frances.‘You never seriously thought of marrying her.You admired her originality, her fearlessness, her energy of body and mind; you delighted in her talent, whatever that was, whether song, dance, or dramatic representation; you worshipped her beauty, which was of the sort after your own heart; but I am sure she filled a sphere from whence you would never have thought of taking a wife.’"
"“说的很好，”亨斯登评价说，“但至于说得对不对就要另当别论了。同时，在露西亚这样一个烛台旁边，你难道不认为你这个小小的精神烛光太暗淡了吗？”","‘Ingenious,’ remarked Hunsden; ‘whether true or not is another question.Meantime, don’t you feel your little lamp of a spirit wax very pale beside such a girandole as Lucia’s?’"
"“是的。”","‘Yes.’"
"“你至少很坦率；教师先生很快就会对你所能发出的微弱光满感到不满的。”","‘Candid, at least; and the professor will soon be dissatisfied with the dim light you give?’"
"“您会这样吗，先生？”","‘Will you, monsieur?’"
"“我的视力总是太差了，受不了强光，弗朗西斯。”这时我们已经到了小门边。","‘My sight was always too weak to endure a blaze, Frances.’ And we had now reached the wicket."
"我在前几页说过这是个甜蜜的夏夜。确实如此；这些天天气都很好，而今天是最好的。干草刚刚从地里拉回来，它的香味仍然弥漫在空气中。弗朗西斯在一两个小时前向我提议在草坪上品茶。我看到圆桌摆在一颗山毛榉下，上面放着陶瓷茶具。我们正等着亨斯登——喏，我听见他正往这边来；是他的声音，正以权威的口吻大谈特谈某件事；我还听见弗朗西斯的搭话声。她当然是在反驳他。他们在争论关于维克托的事情，亨斯登认定他的妈妈正在把他培养成一个毫无男子汉气概的人。克里姆斯沃斯夫人回敬说：","I said, a few pages back, that this is a sweet summer evening.It is; there has been a series of lovely days, and this is the loveliest.The hay is just carried from my fields, its perfume still lingers in the air. Frances proposed to me, an hour or two since, to take tea out on the lawn.I see the round table, loaded with china, placed under a certain beech.Hunsden is expected—nay, I hear he is come; there is his voice, laying down the law on some point with authority; that of Frances replies.She opposes him, of course.They are disputing about Victor, of whom Hunsden affirms that his mother is making a milksop.Mrs. Crimsworth retaliates—"
"“就算成为一个没有男子汉气概的人也比亨斯登所说的‘好孩子’好上一千倍。”她还说如果亨斯登在这附近定居下来，而不是像一颗彗星，来去神秘，没人知道他从哪里来，到哪里去，什么时候，什么方式，何种原因，她只有把维克托送到至少一百英里之外的学校才能安心，因为凭着亨斯登那反叛的准则和不切实际的信条，二十个小孩也会被他毁掉。","‘Better a thousand times he should be a milksop than what he (Hunsden) calls a “a fine lad.” ’ And, moreover, she says that if Hunsden were to become a fixture in the neighbourhood, and were not a mere comet, coming and going no one knows how, when, where, or why, she should be quite uneasy till she had got Victor away to school at least a hundred miles off, for that with his mutinous maxims and unpractical dogmas he would ruin a score of children."
"在我把这部手稿锁进书桌之前我还有几句关于维克托的话要说；但得简短，因为我已经听见银器撞瓷器的叮当声。","I have a word to say of Victor ere I shut this manuscript in my desk; but it must be a brief one, for I hear the tinkle of silver on porcelain."
"维克托不是一个漂亮的小孩，就像我不是一个英俊男人，他的母亲也不是一个标致的女人一般。他脸色苍白，身体瘦小，有着大大的眼睛，像弗朗西斯的眼睛一样黑，像我的眼窝一样深。他的身材很匀称，但是有些瘦小，还算健康。我从没见过一个小孩比他笑得还少，也没有谁像他那样坐着看一本有趣的书，或者听他母亲、亨斯登或者我给他讲冒险、惊险或者神话故事时，眉头还那样紧皱的。尽管比较沉默，他并不是不快乐；虽然表情严肃但也并不孤僻。他很容易受欢乐情绪影响，常常反应过激，几乎有些痴狂了。他是通过很老式的方式，从放在妈妈膝盖上的拼音书开始学习识字的；因为后来他不用靠那种方法鞭策也能读下去时，弗朗西斯认为没有必要给他买象牙字母，也没有尝试那些现在被认为在刺激小孩读书方面是必不可少的方法。从他会读书开始，他便成了小书虫，现在仍然如此。他的玩具很少，他也从没要求要更多。他似乎对已拥有的玩具很偏爱，几乎到了钟情的程度。他的这种情感也延伸到家里养的一两只动物上，他对它们几乎到了深爱的地步。","Victor is as little of a pretty child as I am of a handsome man, or his mother of a fine woman.He is pale and spare, with large eyes, as dark as those of Frances, and as deeply set as mine.His shape is symmetrical enough, but slight; his health is good.I never saw a child smile less than he does, nor one who knits such a formidable brow when sitting over a book that interests him, or while listening to tales of adventure, peril, or wonder, narrated by his mother, Hunsden, or myself.But though still, he is not unhappy; though serious, not morose.He has a susceptibility to pleasurable sensations almost too keen, for it amounts to enthusiasm.He learned to read in the old-fashioned way out of a spelling-book at his mother’s knee; and as he got on without driving by that method, she thought it unnecessary to buy him ivory letters, or to try any of the other inducements to learning now deemed indispensable.When he could read, he became a glutton of books, and is so still.His toys have been few, and he has never wanted more.For those he possesses he seems to have contracted a partiality amounting to affection.This feeling, directed towards one or two living animals of the house, strengthens almost to a passion."
"亨斯登先生送给他一个小猛犬，他就依着赠送者的名字叫它约克。它后来长成一只威武的猛犬，但是在小主人的陪伴与爱抚下，它的凶猛大大地弱化了。没有约克陪伴，维克托哪儿都不去，什么都不干。学习功课的时候约克就躺在他的脚边，约克还和他在花园里嬉戏，陪他小径和树林里散步，吃饭时蹲在他的椅边，是由他亲手喂，他早上的第一件事就是找到约克，晚上睡觉前总是最后一个离开它。有一天约克陪着亨斯登先生去X镇，被街上一条患狂犬病的狗咬伤了。亨斯登先生一把它带回家，告知我情况之后，我马上到院子里开枪射死它，当时约克正在那儿卧着舔伤口。它当场死亡。它都没有看见我拿起枪，我站在它的后面。我回到屋里还没有十分钟，耳边便传来痛苦的哭声。我又回到院子里，因为哭声是从那边传来的。维克托跪在他死去的猛犬旁，弯下身子，抱着它如公牛脖子般的粗脖子，沉浸在悲恸之中。他看见了我。","Mr. Hunsden gave him a mastiff cub, which he called Yorke, after the donor.It grew to a superb dog, whose fierceness, however, was’ much modified by the companionship and caresses of its young master.He would go nowhere, do nothing without Yorke.Yorke lay at his feet while he learned his lessons, played with him in the garden, walked with him in the lane and wood, sat near his chair at meals, was fed always by his own hand, was the first thing he sought in the morning, the last he left at night.Yorke accompanied Mr. Hunsden one day to X—, and was bitten in the street by a dog in a rabid state.As soon as Hunsden had brought him home, and had informed me of the circumstance, I went into the yard and shot him where he lay licking his wound.He was dead in an instant.He had not seen me level the gun; I stood behind him.I had scarcely been ten minutes in the house, when my ear was struck with sounds of anguish.I repaired to the yard once more, for they proceeded thence.Victor was kneeling beside his dead mastiff, bent over it, embracing its bull-like neck, and lost in a passion of the wildest woe.He saw me."
"“啊，爸爸，我永远不会原谅你！永远不会原谅你！”他惊叫道。“你杀死了约克；我从窗子里看见了。我不敢相信你竟然这么残忍。我再也不爱你了！”我花了很大气力并以沉着的语气向他解释这样做很有必要。他仍然用我无法描述的悲痛欲绝的痛苦声音重复着，这声音刺透了我的心：","‘O papa, I’ll never forgive you!I’ll never forgive you!’ was his exclamation.‘You shot Yorke; I saw it from the window.I never believed you could be so cruel.I can love you no more!’ I had much ado to explain to him with a steady voice the stem necessity of the deed.He still, with that inconsolable and bitter accent which I cannot render, but which pierced my heart, repeated,—"
"“它本可以治好的——你本应该试一试——你可以用热铁烧烧伤口，或者用腐蚀剂敷在伤口上。你却没有给它一点时间；现在太晚了——它死了！”","‘He might have been cured—you should have tried—you should have burnt the wound with a hot iron, or covered it with caustic.You gave no time; and now it is too late—he is dead!’"
"他整个身子扑到那毫无知觉的尸体上。我耐心地等了很久，直到他已经哭得筋疲力尽；然后我把他抱到怀里交给他母亲，相信她能给他最好的安慰。她已经从窗户里看到整个情形。她没有出来是因为担心她的情绪会增加我的困难，但是她现在已经做好准备来安抚儿子。她把他抱入自己关爱的怀抱里，让他坐在她柔软的腿上；只是用她的双唇，她的眼睛还有她温柔的环抱安慰了他一段时间；当他的啜泣声慢慢停止，她便告诉他约克在死的时候没有任何痛苦，但是如果让它留下来，自然死去，结局会很可怕；她特别告诉他我并不残忍（因为那个想法似乎给可怜的维克托带来极大的痛苦），就是因为我爱约克和他，我才会那么做的，而且我现在看到他哭得那么厉害，几乎心都碎了。","He sank fairly down on the senseless carcass.I waited patiently a long while, till his grief had somewhat exhausted him; and then I lifted him in my arms and carried him to his mother, sure that she would comfort him best.She had witnessed the whole scene from a window.She would not come out for fear of increasing my difficulties by her emotion, but she was ready now to receive him.She took him to her kind heart, and on to her gentle lap; consoled him but with her lips, her eyes, her soft embrace, for some time; and then, when his sobs diminished, told him that Yorke had felt no pain in dying, and that if he had been left to expire naturally, his end would have been most horrible; above all, she told him that I was not cruel (for that idea seemed to give exquisite pain to poor Victor), that it was my affection for Yorke and him which had made me act so, and that I was now almost heartbroken to see him weep thus bitterly."
"如果他的母亲用这么低沉、这么甜蜜的语调向他讲述这些考虑和理由，再加上她那么亲切而温柔的抚摸和那么怜悯同情的神情，如果对维克托还毫无效果的话，那维克托就不配做他父亲真正的儿子。这确实产生了效果。他逐渐平静下来，脸埋在母亲的肩膀上，安静地趴在她的怀里。不一会儿他抬起头，让他的母亲再跟他说一遍约克是毫无痛苦地死去的，他的父亲并不残忍。母亲又重复了一遍这些温和的话语，他再次将他的脸颊贴在母亲的胸前，又平静下来。","Victor would have been no true son of his father had these considerations, these reasons, breathed in so low, so sweet a tone, married to caresses so benign, so tender, to looks so inspired with pitying sympathy, produced no effect on Wm.They did produce an effect.He grew calmer, rested his face on her shoulder, and lay still in her arms.Looking up shortly, he asked his mother to tell him over again what she had said about Yorke having suffered no pain, and my not being cruel.The balmy words being repeated, he again pillowed his cheek on her breast, and was again tranquil."
"几个小时之后，他来到我的书房，问我是否能够原谅他，表示想和我和解。我把儿子拉到身边，就这样让他呆了好大一会儿，和他谈了很多，在此期间他向我披露了很多方面的情感和想法，我很赞成。我发现他的身上真得没有很多“好孩子”或者“优秀孩子”的特征，也缺少那种喝些葡萄酒就灵光闪现的才能，或者那种能够能给他人熄灭的心灵火焰和带来激情的天赋；但是我发现在他心房的土壤上健康茁壮地生长着同情、喜爱与忠诚的胚芽。我发现在他的智力花园里茁壮地生长着很多有益身心的准则，如理智、公正、品性坚强，只要保持下去，不要枯萎，势必会结出丰盛的果实。所以我在他那宽阔的前额以及苍白的、还带着泪珠的脸颊上自豪而满意地吻了一下，让他得到了安慰，然后就让他走了。但第二天我还是看见他双手遮住脸，躺在约克的坟上。他伤心了好几个星期，大概一年多时间内，他完全不想听再养只狗的建议。","Some hours after, he came to me in my library, asked if I forgave him, and desired to be reconciled.I drew the lad to my side, and there I kept him a good while, and had much talk with him, in the course of which he disclosed many points of feeling and thought I approved of in my son. I found, it is true, few elements of the ‘good fellow’ or the ‘fine fellow’ in him, scant sparkles of the spirit which loves to flash over the wine cup, or which kindles the passions to a destroying fire; but I saw in the soil of his heart healthy and swelling germs of compassion, affection, fidelity.I discovered in the garden of his intellect a rich growth of wholesome principles; reason, justice, moral courage, promised, if not blighted, a fertile bearing.So I bestowed on his large forehead, and on his cheek—still pale with tears—a proud and contented kiss and sent him away comforted.Yet I saw him the next day laid on the mound under which Yorke had been buried, his face covered with his hands.He was melancholy for some weeks, and more than a year elapsed before he would listen to any proposal of having another dog."
"维克托学得很快。很快他就必须到伊顿公学读书，我觉得他在那里的前一两年会很悲惨。离开我，离开母亲，离开这个家会给他的心灵带来极度的痛苦。况且，他不适合替高年级学生跑腿；但是竞争意识，对知识的渴望以及成功的荣耀会逐渐刺激和奖励他的。在这段期间，我自己有着很强烈的抵触情绪来确定一个时间将我的独苗连根拔起，在离我很远的地方重新种植；当我向弗朗西斯提及这件事情时，她强忍着痛苦听着，似乎我在说一次可怕的手术，她的母性本能使她感到不寒而栗，但她的坚韧不拔不允许她畏缩。但是必须得走这一步，而且马上就要走；因为虽然弗朗西斯不想将儿子培养成没有男子汉气概的人，但她要让他习惯于一种新的待人方式，习惯于自制，习惯于志同道合的友情，而这些，除了在学校外，在任何人那里都得不到。她看到了，正如我也看到了，维克托的脾气里有着一种东西——一种像电一般的热情和力量——时而出现，迸发出令人生畏的火花。亨斯登称它为他的精神，说那不应该被强加控制。我说那是惹是生非的亚当潜移默化的影响，并且认为就算不从他身上赶走，至少也要正确地加以控制；不然任何一点肉体或者精神上的痛苦都会毁掉他，而只有这些痛苦才能使他彻底地学会自制。弗朗西斯不知道该怎么称呼儿子性格里的这种特质；但是每当它出现在他咬牙切齿时，出现在他怒火中烧的眼睛时，出现在他对于失望、灾难、突然的悲伤或者自认为的不公表现出激烈的反抗时，她会把他搂入怀中，或者独自带他去树林里走走。然后她会像哲学家一样劝服他，而维克托一向能听进去这种劝导；然后她就会满眼慈爱地看着他，维克托总会被慈爱征服的。但是将来世界也会用劝导和慈爱来面对他的狂暴吗？啊，不会的！因为他黑色眼睛里的怒火，因为他消瘦的眉头上的阴云，因为他轮廓清晰的唇角上绷紧的表情，这个孩子总有一天得到的不会是温言软语而是当头痛击，不是甜蜜一吻，而是拳打脚踢。那时无言的愤怒会使他身体虚弱、灵魂发疯，我相信受点痛苦挫折是应当并且是有益的，这样会使他成为一个更为明智和优秀的人！","Victor learns fast.He must soon go to Eton, where, I suspect, his first year or two will be utter wretchedness.To leave me, his mother, and his home, will give his heart an agonized wrench.Then, the fagging will not suit him; but emulation, thirst after knowledge, the glory of success, will stir and reward him in time.Meantime, I feel in myself a strong repugnance to fix the hour which will uproot my sole olive branch and transplant it far from me; and, when I speak to Frances on the subject, I am heard with a kind of patient pain, as though I alluded to some fearful operation, at which her nature shudders, but from which her fortitude will not permit her to recoil.The step must, however, be taken, and it shall be; for, though Frances will not make a milksop of her son, she will accustom him to a style of treatment, a forbearance, a congenial tenderness, he will meet with from none else.She sees, as I also see, a something in Victor’s temper—a kind of electrical ardour and power—which emits, now and then, ominous sparks.Hunsden calls it his spirit, and says it should not be curbed.I call it the leaven of the offending Adam, and consider that it should be, if not whipped out of him, at least soundly disciplined; and that he will be cheap of any amount of either bodily or mental suffering which will ground him radically in the art of self-control.Frances gives this something in her son’s marked character no name; but when it appears in the grinding of his teeth, in the glittering of his eye, in the fierce revolt of feeling against disappointment, mischance, sudden sorrow, or supposed injustice, she folds him to her breast, or takes him to walk with her alone in the wood.Then she reasons with him like any philosopher, and to reason Victor is ever accessible; then she looks at him with eyes of love, and by love Victor can be infallibly subjugated.But will reason or love be the weapons with which in future the world will meet his violence?Oh, no!For that flash in his black eye, for that cloud on his bony brow, for that compression of his statuesque lips, the lad will some day get blows instead of blandishments, kicks instead of kisses.Then for the fit of mute fury which will sicken his body and madden his soul, then for the ordeal of merited and salutary suffering out of which he will come, I trust, a wiser and a better man!"
"此时我看到了他。他站在亨斯登旁边，亨斯登正坐在山毛榉树下的草坪上。亨斯登一只手放在孩子的衣领上，也不知道他往孩子的耳朵里灌输着什么原则。维克托此刻看起来非常好，因为他面带微笑饶有兴致地听着，他笑的时候是最像他母亲了。可惜的是这种像阳光冲破乌云的表情太少见了！维克托对亨斯登有着一种偏爱，我觉得这样挺好，但他对他的感情比我对这位仁兄的要更加强烈、更坚决、也更全心全意。弗朗西斯也有一种无以言表的焦虑；每当儿子倚靠在亨斯登的膝盖上，或者靠在他的肩膀上，弗朗西斯就会不安地在附近走来走去，就像一只母鸽要保卫它的孩子不会被在近处盘旋的老鹰叼走一样。她说她很希望亨斯登有自己的孩子，那时他就会更好地知道放纵孩子骄傲的秉性，容忍他们的各种缺点是很危险的。","I see him now.He stands by Hunsden, who is seated on the lawn under the beech.Hunsden’s hand rests on the boy’s collar, and he is instilling God knows what principles into his ear. Victor looks well just now, for he listens with a sort of smiling interest, he never looks so like his mother as when he smiles.Pity the sunshine breaks out so rarely!Victor has a preference for Hunsden, full as strong as I deem desirable, being considerably more potent, decided, and undiscriminating than any I ever entertained for that personage myself. Frances, too, regards it with a sort of unexpressed anxiety; while her son leans on Hunsden’s knee, or rests against his shoulder, she roves with restless movement round, like a dove guarding its young from a hovering hawk.She says she wishes Hunsden had children of his own, for then better know the danger of inciting their pride and their foibles."
"弗朗西斯走到我的书房窗边，拨开半遮住窗户的金银花枝，告诉我茶已经准备好了。看到我还在忙，她走进屋里，轻轻地走到我身边，手搭在我的肩膀上。","Frances approaches my library window, puts honeysuckle which half covers it, and tells me tea is ready.Seeing that I continue busy, she enters the room, comes near me quietly, and puts her hand on my shoulder."
"“先生真是太用功了。”","‘Monsieur est trop appliqué.’"
"“我马上就写完了。”","‘I shall soon have done.’"
"她拉近一张椅子，坐在那儿等我写完。她在我的身边，我心里很高兴，就像闻到了新鲜干草和沁人心脾的花朵的香味，就像感受到落日的余晖，享受到仲夏之夜的宁静。","She draws a chair near, and sits down to wait till I have finished.Her presence is as pleasant to my mind as the perfume of the fresh hay and spicy flowers, as the glow of the westering sun, as the repose of the midsummer eve are to my senses."
"但是亨斯登来了。我听见他的脚步声，看着他弯腰将身子伸进了格子窗，用那无情的手将窗旁的金银花树枝拨到一边，吓走了两只蜜蜂和一只蝴蝶。","But Hunsden comes.I hear his step, and there he is, bending through the lattice, from which he has thrust away the woodbine with unsparing hand, disturbing two bees and a butterfly."
"“克里姆斯沃思！我说克里姆斯沃思！拿掉他手上的笔，夫人，让他抬起头。”","‘Crimsworth!I say, Crimsworth!Take that pen out of his hand, mistress, and make him lift up his head.’"
"“怎么了，亨斯登？我听你说着呢——”","‘Well, Hunsden?I hear you—’"
"“我昨天在X镇。你哥哥内德做铁路投机买卖发财了，现在比克里萨斯还要富有。他们称他已经跻身股票交易大厅的十大股票投机商之一。而且我听布朗先生说。范登赫顿夫妇和让·巴普蒂斯特谈到下个月要来看你们。他还提到了珀莱夫妇。他说他们的家庭并不算世界上最和谐的，但是在事业上他们干得是“不能再好了”，他总结说，这种情况对于双方感情上的任何小的磨难都足够称得上是一种慰藉。你为什么不邀请珀莱夫妇来某某郡呢，克里姆斯沃思？我很想见一见你的初恋情人佐蕾德。夫人别嫉妒，他爱那位夫人可是爱到精神错乱呢；我可是有事实根据的。布朗说她现在重达十二英石。教师先生，你看你丢掉了什么。现在，先生、夫人，如果你们再不来用茶的话，我和维克托就要先开始了哦。”","‘I was at X— yesterday.Your brother Ned is getting richer than Cresus by railway speculations.They call him in the Piece Hall a stag of ten.And I have heard from Brown.M. and Madame Vandenhuten and Jean Baptiste talk of coming to see you next month.He mentions the Pelets too.He says their domestic harmony is not the finest in the world, but in business they are doing “on ne peut mieux,” which circumstance, he concludes, will be a sufficient consolation to both for any little crosses in the affections.Why don’t you invite the Pelets to —shire, Crimsworth?I should so like to see your first flame, Zoraïde.Mistress, don’t be jealous, but he loved that lady to distraction; I know it for a fact.Brown says she weighs twelve stones now.You see what you’ve lost, Mr. Professor.Now, monsieur and madame, if you don’t come to tea, Victor and I will begin without you.’"
