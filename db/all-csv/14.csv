"第一章","Chapter 1"
"如果能让她心动，那就戴顶金帽子；如果你能跳高，那就也为她跳一跳，直到她高呼：“情人，戴着金帽子、高高跳起的情人，我非得将你要！”","Then wear the gold hat, if that will move her; If you can bounce high, bounce for her too, Till she cry ‘Lover, gold-hatted, high-bouncing lover, I must have you!’"
"——托马斯·帕克·丹维里埃","—THOMAS PARKE D’INVILLIERS"
"父亲在我年轻的时候对我的告诫，直到今天我还牢记于心。","In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I’ve been turning over in my mind ever since."
"“每当你想批评别人的时候，”他对我说，“一定要记得并不是世界上每个人都曾拥有你所拥有的优势。”","‘Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,’ he told me, ‘just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.’"
"他没有再多说什么，但是我们之间的交流向来就不需要太多的语言，我也明白父亲的话意味深长。这样一来，我喜欢保留自己的所有看法，也正是这种习惯让我了解到很多生性古怪的人，同时也使我成为很多向来无聊的人的牺牲品。当一个正常人拥有这种特质的时候，那些心理异常的人很快就会发觉并将其死死缠住。于是，在大学里，我因为私下聆听了一些情绪失控的陌生人倾诉的秘密与痛楚，而无辜地被指责为“小政客”。我一般不会询问或打听别人的什么隐私或秘密。每当我明显感觉到有谁迫不及待地想对我倾吐心声的时候，我就假装睡觉，假装专心做事，或表现出一副不友好的样子，轻率了事——因为年轻人所倾诉的，或至少他们倾诉时说的那些话往往都是剽窃别人的，而且他们总是明显地克制自己。保留看法代表着无尽的希望。父亲一直这样略显清高地教育我，人从一出生开始，所拥有的优势和特质就不一样，我也一直略显清高地听从父亲的教导，而且至今我依然生怕自己由于忘记了父亲的教导而错过一些东西。 ","He didn’t say any more but we’ve always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that.In consequence I’m inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores.The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men.Most of the confidences were unsought—frequently I have feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on the horizon—for the intimate revelations of young men or at least the terms in which they express them are usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions.Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope.I am still a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth."
"在对自己的容忍力做这么一番自我吹嘘之后，我还得承认自己的容忍力也是有限度的。一个人的操行可能坚守于磐石之上或湿地沼泽之中，但是超过了某种限度之后，我就不会在乎操行的基础到底是什么了。去年秋天我从东部归来以后，感觉自己好想让整个世界都穿上军装，全世界的人都能时刻将道德准则铭记于心，我不希望自己再肆无忌惮地带着优越感去窥探别人内心深处的秘密。唯独盖茨比——也就是将其名字奉献给本书的人——要被排除到我的反应之外，盖茨比也正代表了我始终所不屑和蔑视的一切。如果将人格视为持续不断地成功的表现，那么在盖茨比身上很了不起的一点就是他对于生活希望的高度敏感性，他的敏感能让人把他和那种能够记录千里之外地震数据的精密仪器相联系。盖茨比的敏感与那种被美其名曰为“创造性气质”的神经质不同，这种敏感是一种对于希望不同寻常的坚持，同时也是一种充满浪漫色彩的敏捷性。这种敏感是我从来不曾在哪个人的身上发现过的，我相信以后我也不会再从谁的身上找到。不——盖茨比一直都是不错的，而那些总是折磨着他的东西，那些在他梦醒之后将周围环境弄得污浊不堪的东西，却让我对于人们毫无意义的悲伤以及瞬间的欢快失去了兴趣。","And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission that it has a limit.Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes but after a certain point I don’t care what it’s founded on.When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart.Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was exempt from my reaction—Gatsby who represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn.If personality is an unbroken series of successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten thousand miles away.This responsiveness had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the ‘creative temperament’—it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again.No—Gatsby turned out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men."
"在这座中西部城市，我家连续三代都算是有头有脸的上流人士。卡拉韦家族也算庞大，相传我们是布克娄奇公爵的后裔，但我们家的创始人实际上是我爷爷的哥哥。1851年，他来到这里，找了个人替他去参加内战，然后自己开始做批发五金器具的生意，之后父亲继承经营，一直到今天。","My family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this middle-western city for three generations.The Carraways are something of a clan and we have a tradition that we’re descended from the Dukes of Buccleuch, but the actual founder of my line was my grandfather’s brother who came here in fifty-one, sent a substitute to the Civil War and started the wholesale hardware business that my father carries on today."
"据说我长得很像一位叔祖父，我从来没有见过这位叔祖父长什么样，唯一的依据就是父亲办公室里挂的那幅他毫无表情的照片。我于1915年毕业于纽黑文大学，刚好比父亲晚毕业整整二十五年。毕业不久我就参加了被延迟了的条顿民族大迁移，此次迁移被誉为“世界大战”。我彻彻底底地享受了一番反击的乐趣，回来之后还是久久无法平静。中西部已不再是世界上最舒适的地方了，现在它似乎变成了世界上最破旧的边缘——于是我决定去东部学习做债券生意。既然我认识的人都在做债券生意，那么也就不在乎再多一个我这样的单身汉了。我的叔姨姑舅们对此大加讨论一番，仿佛在帮我挑选大学预科学校一样，最后他们个个表情沉重，满脸犹豫地说：“干嘛不去，要不就去吧！”父亲同意帮我支付一年的费用。几经推迟后，我于1922年春天来到了东部，那时自己感觉是要在这里一直定居下去。","I never saw this great-uncle but I’m supposed to look like him—with special reference to the rather hard-boiled painting that hangs in Father’s office.I graduated from New Haven in 1915, just a quarter of a century after my father, and a little later I participated in that delayed Teutonic migration known as the Great War.I enjoyed the counter-raid so thoroughly that I came back restless.Instead of being the warm center of the world the middle-west now seemed like the ragged edge of the universe—so I decided to go east and learn the bond business.Everybody I knew was in the bond business so I supposed it could support one more single man.All my aunts and uncles talked it over as if they were choosing a prep-school for me and finally said, ‘Why—ye-es’ with very grave, hesitant faces.Father agreed to finance me for a year and after various delays I came east, permanently, I thought, in the spring of twenty-two."
"最实际的事就是要在城里找住处，但是当时天气暖和，而且我离开的时候家里也到处是绿草幽幽，树木宜人，所以当办公室的一个年轻人提议要与我在郊区镇上合租一套房子时，我觉得这个想法真是太棒了。他租了一座历经风雨剥蚀的木板平房，每月八十美元，但是就在我们要搬进去的最后一刻，他被公司调到华盛顿去了，我自己一个人去郊区住了。我养了一条狗，买了一辆道奇车，还雇了一个芬兰女佣帮我整理房间并做早饭。狗养了几天后就跑丢了。而那个芬兰女佣每天在电炉旁一边做饭，一边自己咕哝着芬兰的至理名言。","The practical thing was to find rooms in the city but it was a warm season and I had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly trees, so when a young man at the office suggested that we take a house together in a commuting town it sounded like a great idea.He found the house, a weather beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a month, but at the last minute the firm ordered him to Washington and I went out to the country alone.I had a dog, at least I had him for a few days until he ran away, and an old Dodge and a Finnish woman who made my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered Finnish wisdom to herself over the electric stove."
"那几天确实感觉有些孤独，直到一天早上，一个在我之后搬来的男人将我在路上拦住。","It was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man, more recently arrived than I, stopped me on the road."
"他带着些许无助，开口问道：“请问去西卵村怎么走？”","‘How do you get to West Egg village?’ he asked helplessly."
"我就告诉了他应该怎么走。然后我继续往前走，这时我已经不再感觉孤独了。我是最早搬到这里的，于是就成了向导和开拓者。他无意间还授予了我在附近一带自由活动的权利。","I told him.And as I walked on I was lonely no longer.I was a guide, a pathfinder, an original settler.He had casually conferred on me the freedom of the neighborhood."
"在明媚的阳光里，树木一夜之间就都已经换上了绿色的新装——这变化就如电影里演的那般迅速——一个熟悉的信念在我心里出现：随着夏天的到来，生活将重新开始。","And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees—just as things grow in fast movies—I had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer."
"首先，有很多的书要读，而且呼吸着这样清新宜人的空气，整个人都觉得神清气爽。我买了十几本书，是关于银行业务、信贷、以及投资证券的。这些包有红色和金色封皮的新书直立在书架上，仿佛造币厂刚印刷出来的新币，它们一定会为我揭晓弥达斯、摩根以及米塞纳斯的制胜秘诀。而且我有雄心要阅读很多其他方面的书。读大学时，我就很喜欢读书——记得有一年我在《耶鲁新闻》上发表了一系列沉重严肃却又浅显易懂的社论——而现在，我要将昔日的辉煌重写，我要再次成为那种中等水平的专家，也就是一个“通才”。这并不仅仅是一句隽语——毕竟，从单一的角度来看，人生要显得更加成功。我租房子的地方竟然属于北美最不同寻常的区域之一，这一切纯属巧合。这是一个形状细长、喧闹无比的岛屿，这个岛一直延伸到纽约的东部。这里有一些自然奇观，其中一处就是两片异乎寻常的地貌。在距离城市二十英里的地方，有两个硕大无比的卵形岛屿，其形状相同，仅被一条浅湾隔开，延伸到西半球最恬静的咸水域，即长岛海峡的巨大湿地区域。它们的形状并不是标准的椭圆形——就像哥伦布在故事里描写的蛋一样，在接壤处是犹如碰撞过形成的扁平状——但是它们形状是如此地相似，就连从天空掠过的海鸥都一定会对此困惑不已。而对于那些没有翅膀的来说，更加引人注意的现象就是除了形状大小相同，这两个岛在其他方面都截然不同。","There was so much to read for one thing and so much fine health to be pulled down out of the young breath-giving air.I bought a dozen volumes on banking and credit and investment securities and they stood on my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint, promising to unfold the shining secrets that only Midas and Morgan and Maecenas knew.And I had the high intention of reading many other books besides.I was rather literary in college—one year I wrote a series of very solemn and obvious editorials for the ‘Yale News’—and now I was going to bring back all such things into my life and become again that most limited of all specialists, the ‘well-rounded man.’This isn’t just an epigram—life is much more successfully looked at from a single window, after all.It was a matter of chance that I should have rented a house in one of the strangest communities in North America.It was on that slender riotous island which extends itself due east of New York and where there are, among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of land.Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the most domesticated body of salt water in the Western Hemisphere, the great wet barnyard of Long Island Sound.They are not perfect ovals—like the egg in the Columbus story they are both crushed flat at the contact end—but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual confusion to the gulls that fly overhead.To the wingless a more arresting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular except shape and size."
"我住在西卵，就是两个岛中相对不怎么时髦的一个，这算是再肤浅不过的表达方式了，因为比较两岛时总是充满着离奇和不祥的感觉。我的房子就在蛋尖上，距海湾只有五十码，紧挨我房子两边的是两座气派的别墅，一个季度的租金要一万二到一万五。我房子右边的私人别墅，从任何一方面来说，都算是大得无与伦比——她简直就是诺曼底市政厅的翻版，别墅的一边有一座塔楼，塔边上攀爬着一簇鲜嫩的常青藤，让整个塔楼显得崭新夺目。楼旁有一个大理石游泳池，四十多英亩的大草坪和一个花园。这里就是盖茨比的私人公寓。或者说，在这座私人公寓里，住着一位姓盖茨比的先生，因为我当时并不认识盖茨比。我自己的房子破旧得有些不堪入目，但是幸好房子不大，无人注意，而我因此也可以欣赏海景，观赏邻居的部分草坪，并以能与百万富翁为邻而自我安慰——所有这些只需每月支付八十美元。","I lived at West Egg, the—well, the less fashionable of the two, though this is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little sinister contrast between them.My house was at the very tip of the egg, only fifty yards from the Sound, and squeezed between two huge places that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season.The one on my right was a colossal affair by any standard—it was a factual imitation of some Hotel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on one side, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble swimming pool and more than forty acres of lawn and garden.It was Gatsby’s mansion.Or rather, as I didn’t know Mr. Gatsby it was a mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name.My own house was an eye-sore, but it was a small eye-sore, and it had been overlooked, so I had a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbor’s lawn, and the consoling proximity of millionaires—all for eighty dollars a month."
"海湾对面是时尚的东卵区，一座座白色的豪宅倒映在水里，显得更加璀璨夺目。就在那年夏天的一个傍晚，我开车去汤姆·布坎南夫妇家吃饭，故事也就从这里开始。黛西是我的远房表妹；而我在大学的时候就认识汤姆。战争刚结束的时候，我在芝加哥同他们呆了两天。","Across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable East Egg glittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins on the evening I drove over there to have dinner with the Tom Buchanans.Daisy was my second cousin once removed and I’d known Tom in college.And just after the war I spent two days with them in Chicago."
"她的丈夫不但擅长各种体育活动，而且曾经是纽黑文最有实力的橄榄球队边锋之一，因此在一定程度上也算是全国知名人物了。这种21岁就在某一领域登上顶峰的人，将来的一切都未免有走下坡路的感觉。他出生在一个非常富有的家庭——他读大学时，就可以自由挥霍金钱，还因此遭人非议——但是现在他已经从芝加哥搬到了东部。当时，他搬家的豪华阵容真是令人瞠目结舌：例如，他仅是马球马匹就从森林湖畔带来一长列。和我同龄的男人能够阔绰到如此程度，也确实有点令人难以置信。","Her husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of the most powerful ends that ever played football at New Haven—a national figure in a way, one of those men who reach such an acute limited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterward savors of anti-climax.His family were enormously wealthy—even in college his freedom with money was a matter for reproach—but now he’d left Chicago and come east in a fashion that rather took your breath away: for instance he’d brought down a string of polo ponies from Lake Forest.It was hard to realize that a man in my own generation was wealthy enough to do that."
"我不清楚他们为什么要搬到东部来。他们无缘无故地去法国呆了一年，然后又四处飘荡，他们所到之处总会聚集一群富豪，还经常一起打马球。黛西在电话上告诉我，这次搬来要定居到这里，但是我不相信她的话——我并不了解黛西的心思，但是我感觉汤姆会永远地这样飘荡下去，因为他渴望追求由一场场橄榄球赛所带来的刺激与兴奋，这种球赛不容错过。于是，在一个微风送爽的傍晚，我开车来东卵探望两个自己都不怎么熟悉的朋友。他们房子的精致华贵完全出乎我的预料，一座红白相间、令人赏心悦目的乔治王殖民期风格的豪宅临海而立。足有四分之一英里长的草坪从海滩一直朝家门口飞奔而来，越过日晷，砖墙以及花红似火的私人花园——最后到达房子边缘，仿佛是借助其奔跑之势，青草变成了鲜嫩的蔓藤，从房子的一边攀爬而上。草坪边上直立着一面法式落地窗，此刻正在彤红的晚霞里发着金光，窗户迎着温和宜人的晚风敞开着，汤姆·布坎南身着骑手服，双腿叉开，站在前门阳台上。","Why they came east I don’t know.They had spent a year in France, for no particular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully wherever people played polo and were rich together.This was a permanent move, said Daisy over the telephone, but I didn’t believe it—I had no sight into Daisy’s heart but I felt that Tom would drift on forever seeking a little wistfully for the dramatic turbulence of some irrecoverable football game.And so it happened that on a warm windy evening I drove over to East Egg to see two old friends whom I scarcely knew at all.Their house was even more elaborate than I expected, a cheerful red and white Georgian Colonial mansion overlooking the bay.The lawn started at the beach and ran toward the front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping over sun-dials and brick walks and burning gardens—finally when it reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though from the momentum of its run.The front was broken by a line of French windows, glowing now with reflected gold, and wide open to the warm windy afternoon, and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his legs apart on the front porch."
"与在纽黑文的时候相比，他基本上没有什么变化。如今他已是年过三十，身体强健，满头黄发，嘴角露出强硬之气，看上去盛气凌人。一双炯炯有神的眼睛流露着傲慢之气，他的眼睛非常引人注意，好像在告诉人们他是一个自信胆大而且积极上进的人。即使是他那柔软而优雅的骑手服也掩盖不了那强壮有力的身躯——他似乎是把那双锃亮的鞋子塞满后，又将上边的鞋带绷紧，而且当他的肩膀在那薄薄的上衣下动一下，你就可以看到下面大块的肌肉在移动。那是一个强壮有力的躯体，一个冷酷的躯体。","He had changed since his New Haven years.Now he was a sturdy, straw haired man of thirty with a rather hard mouth and a supercilious manner.Two shining, arrogant eyes had established dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward.Not even the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could hide the enormous power of that body—he seemed to fill those glistening boots until he strained the top lacing and you could see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his thin coat.It was a body capable of enormous leverage—a cruel body."
"他说话时声音粗哑，加深了他给人的那种性情暴戾的印象。即便是他同自己很喜欢的人说话，也总是带着一种居高临下的轻蔑口吻——于是在纽黑文就不难找出对他的狂妄自大深恶痛绝之人。","His speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of fractiousness he conveyed.There was a touch of paternal contempt in it, even toward people he liked—and there were men at New Haven who had hated his guts."
"他似乎在说: “嘿，不要仅仅因为我比你强壮，比你有男子汉气概，就觉得我对这些问题的看法不容更改。”我们同属一个高年级学生社团，虽然我们关系不是很亲密，但我一直都觉得他对我很好，并且希望我能喜欢他，一个带着特有的粗狂与傲慢之气的他。","‘Now, don’t think my opinion on these matters is final,’ he seemed to say, ‘just because I’m stronger and more of a man than you are.’We were in the same Senior Society, and while we were never intimate I always had the impression that he approved of me and wanted me to like him with some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own."
"我们在阳光明媚的阳台上聊了一会。","We talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch."
"“我的住所的确不错。”他对我说，一双眼睛不停地眨来眨去。","‘I’ve got a nice place here,’ he said, his eyes flashing about restlessly."
"他揪住我的一个胳膊，拉我转过身，然后一挥他那宽大的手，给我指着前面的景色，包括一座意大利凹陷式的私人花园，半英亩散发着浓郁香味的深色玫瑰，还有一艘前端扁平的汽艇，在岸上随着波浪上下起伏。","Turning me around by one arm he moved a broad flat hand along the front vista, including in its sweep a sunken Italian garden, a half acre of deep pungent roses and a snub-nosed motor boat that bumped the tide off shore."
"”这里以前属于石油巨头德梅因。”他突然又礼貌地拉我转过身，“我们进屋吧。”","‘It belonged to Demaine the oil man.’He turned me around again, politely and abruptly.‘We’ll go inside.’"
"穿过一条很高的过道，我们来到一间明亮的玫瑰色房间，房间两边脆弱地镶嵌着法式落地窗户。窗户微开着，窗外的嫩草与明亮的玻璃相互映衬，看上去好像青草一直延伸到了屋内。一阵微风吹进房间，窗帘从一头被吹进来，又从另外一头被吹了出去，看上去仿佛是淡色的旗帜，被风卷着飘向天花板上装饰着的磨砂结婚蛋糕——然后又在深红色的地毯上像波浪一样起起伏伏，那种晃晃的影子犹如清风吹过海面的感觉。","We walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-colored space, fragilely bound into the house by French windows at either end.The windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a little way into the house.A breeze blew through the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding cake of the ceiling—and then rippled over the wine-colored rug, making a shadow on it as wind does on the sea."
"房间里只有那张宽大厚实的沙发在那里一动不动，沙发上躺着两个年轻女子，她们看上去好像躺在一个固定在地面的气球上一般。她们穿着白色的衣服，衣服在微风中翩然舞动，似乎她们刚刚趁着微风环绕屋内飞了一圈后回到了这里。我在那里站了一会，听着窗帘随风噼里啪啦地抽打着墙壁，墙上的挂画在那里嘎吱嘎吱地响。突然只听砰的一声，汤姆·布坎南将后面的窗户关上了，屋子里风渐渐平息，窗帘和地毯变得安静，两位年轻女子也似乎随着气球降落到地面。","The only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored balloon.They were both in white and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight around the house.I must have stood for a few moments listening to the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a picture on the wall.Then there was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the rear windows and the caught wind died out about the room and the curtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the floor."
"我不认识两位中那个年轻一点的。她全身伸展，一动不动的躺在沙发长椅的一头，下巴向上微微翘起，好像在平衡什么东西不让它掉下来似的。如果她用眼角的余光瞟到我了，也没有任何反应——而我倒确实大吃一惊，差点因为自己的到来打扰了她而开口向她道歉。","The younger of the two was a stranger to me.She was extended full length at her end of the divan, completely motionless and with her chin raised a little as if she were balancing something on it which was quite likely to fall.If she saw me out of the corner of her eyes she gave no hint of it—indeed, I was almost surprised into murmuring an apology for having disturbed her by coming in."
"另外一位女子就是黛西，她试图想要站起来——她的身体微微前倾，一脸诚意——然后她发出了一声娇媚又有点奇怪的轻笑，我也笑了起来，向前走进了屋内。","The other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise—she leaned slightly forward with a conscientious expression—then she laughed, an absurd, charming little laugh, and I laughed too and came forward into the room."
"“我幸福得都动……动弹不了了。”","‘I’m p-paralyzed with happiness.’"
"她再次笑了起来，好像刚刚说了句俏皮话，然后她握着我的手，抬头看着我，似乎要让我明白我是她在这个世界上最想见到的人。那是她特有的待人方式。她小声提示我，那位做平衡姿势的女孩姓贝克。（我曾听说黛西低声细语只是为了让人身体前倾靠近她。不过，这些毫不相干的闲言碎语丝毫不影响她的魅力。)","She laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held my hand for a moment, looking up into my face, promising that there was no one in the world she so much wanted to see.That was a way she had.She hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was Baker.(I’ve heard it said that Daisy’s murmur was only to make people lean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made it no less charming.)"
"无论如何，那位贝克小姐还是动了一下嘴唇，用几乎让人察觉不到的动作向我点头问好，然后她又赶紧把头转回去——而她一直努力平衡着的东西明显动了一下，这可把她吓了一跳。我又一次想开口向她表示歉意了。几乎所有这种高傲自信的表现都会让我目瞪口呆，仰慕不已。","At any rate Miss Baker’s lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost imperceptibly and then quickly tipped her head back again—the object she was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her something of a fright.Again a sort of apology arose to my lips.Almost any exhibition of complete self sufficiency draws a stunned tribute from me."
"我回过头来看着我的表妹，她开始用那低柔而激动的声音问我话了。那声音委婉动听，仿佛是永远只能演奏一遍的音符，让人忍不住细耳聆听。她那忧郁而可人的脸颊带着一丝欢快，还有一双明亮的眼睛和一张热情而性感的嘴——但是，她的声音总是带有一种激情和活力，这种声音让那些深深爱慕着她的男士无法忘却：如同音乐般动人；一句轻声的“听着”；一声许诺——她刚才玩得很开心，而且下个小时也会感到开心刺激。","I looked back at my cousin who began to ask me questions in her low, thrilling voice.It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and down as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be played again.Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it, bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth—but there was an excitement in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget: a singing compulsion, a whispered ‘Listen,’ a promise that she had done gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay, exciting things hovering in the next hour."
"我告诉她我在来东部途中如何在芝加哥停留一天，在那里十几个朋友如何让我转达他们的问候。","I told her how I had stopped off in Chicago for a day on my way east and how a dozen people had sent their love through me."
"“他们都想念我吗？”她欢天喜地地叫道。","Do they miss me?' she cried ecstatically."
"“整个城镇一片荒凉。所有汽车的左后轮胎都被涂成了黑色，仿佛致哀的花圈，北滨沿岸整整一夜都回荡着哀号声。”","‘The whole town is desolate.All the cars have the left rear wheel painted black as a mourning wreath and there’s a persistent wail all night along the North Shore.’"
"“好美妙啊！汤姆，我们回去吧。明天！”然后，她又有点前言不搭后语地说：“你该去看看孩子。”","‘How gorgeous!Let’s go back, Tom.Tomorrow!’Then she added irrelevantly, ‘You ought to see the baby.’"
"“我想去看看。”","‘I’d like to.’"
"“她现在在睡觉。她两岁了。难道你从来没有见过她吗？”“从没见过。”","‘She’s asleep.She’s two years old.Haven’t you ever seen her?’‘Never.’"
"“那你该去看看她。她……”刚才一直在屋里不停地走来走去的汤姆·布坎南突然停下来，伸出一只手搂住我的肩膀。“尼克，你最近在忙什么？”“我是做债券生意的。”","‘Well, you ought to see her.She’s—’ Tom Buchanan who had been hovering restlessly about the room stopped and rested his hand on my shoulder.‘What you doing, Nick?’‘I’m a bond man.’"
"“和谁做？”","‘Who with?’"
"我把情况告诉了他。","I told him."
"“我从来没听说过他们。”他语气果断地说。这让我有点生气。","‘Never heard of them,’ he remarked decisively.This annoyed me."
"“你以后会听说的。”我立刻对他说，“只要你一直在东部住，你以后就会听说的。”","‘You will,’ I answered shortly.‘You will if you stay in the East.’"
"“噢，不用担心，我会一直在东部住下去的。”他边说边瞟了黛西一眼，然后又看看我，似乎有所防备，“我要是去其他地方住，那简直傻死了。”","‘Oh, I’ll stay in the East, don’t you worry,’ he said, glancing at Daisy and then back at me, as if he were alert for something more.‘I’d be a God Damned fool to live anywhere else.’"
"这时只听贝克小姐说“当然了！”她突如其来的一句话把我惊住了——这是从我进屋以来她说的第一句话。显然她也同我一样有点吃惊，因为她打着呵欠，灵巧而迅速地站了起来。","At this point Miss Baker said ‘Absolutely!’ with such suddenness that I startled—it was the first word she uttered since I came into the room.Evidently it surprised her as much as it did me, for she yawned and with a series of rapid, deft movements stood up into the room."
"“我已经僵了，”她抱怨道，“我在沙发上躺了好久好久。”","‘I’m stiff,’ she complained, ‘I’ve been lying on that sofa for as long as I can remember.’"
"“别看我了，”黛西还嘴说道，“我一下午都在试图说服你去纽约。”","‘Don’t look at me,’ Daisy retorted.‘I’ve been trying to get you to New York all afternoon.’"
"“谢谢，不过不用了。”贝克小姐看着刚从备膳室端出来的四杯鸡尾酒说道，“我绝对还处于训练阶段。”","‘No, thanks,’ said Miss Baker to the four cocktails just in from the pantry, ‘I’m absolutely in training.’"
"她的男主人半信半疑地看着她。","Her host looked at her incredulously."
"“是嘛！”他将自己杯中的酒一口喝下，仿佛只饮了杯底的一滴。“你做的那些事我都做不来。”","‘You are!’He took down his drink as if it were a drop in the bottom of a glass.‘How you ever get anything done is beyond me.’"
"我看着贝克小姐，很好奇她到底要“做”什么事情。看着她我很享受。她长得身材苗条，乳房瘦小，站在那里像一个军校学员一般挺胸抬头，身材越显挺拔。她那灰色的眼睛迎着阳光半眯着，带着同样的好奇，很礼貌地看着我，苍白而娇媚的脸上露出一丝不满。此刻我突然想起自己好像在哪儿见过她，或看过她的照片。","I looked at Miss Baker wondering what it was she ‘got done.’I enjoyed looking at her.She was a slender, small—breasted girl, with an erect carriage which she accentuated by throwing her body backward at the shoulders like a young cadet.Her grey sun-strained eyes looked back at me with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charming discontented face.It occurred to me now that I had seen her, or a picture of her, somewhere before."
"“你住在西卵吧，”她轻蔑地说，“我在那边有个认识的人。”","‘You live in West Egg,’ she remarked contemptuously.‘I know somebody there.’"
"“我谁都不认识……”","‘I don’t know a single—’"
"“你一定认识盖茨比。”","‘You must know Gatsby.’"
"“盖茨比？”黛西询问道，“哪个盖茨比啊？”","‘Gatsby?’ demanded Daisy.‘What Gatsby?’"
"我刚要回答说他是我的邻居，就有人宣布开饭了。汤姆·布坎南强行把他那硬实的胳膊插到我的胳膊下，将我从房间硬拖出去，像是在挪动棋盘上的一颗棋子一般。","Before I could reply that he was my neighbor dinner was announced; wedging his tense arm imperatively under mine Tom Buchanan compelled me from the room as though he were moving a checker to another square."
"这两位年轻的女士将双手轻轻搭在臀部，无精打采地跟着我们来到玫瑰色的阳台上。阳台正朝落日方向，桌子上点着四根蜡烛，烛光在平息了一点的风中摇曳不定。","Slenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips the two young women preceded us out onto a rosy-colored porch open toward the sunset where four candles flickered on the table in the diminished wind."
"“干嘛要点蜡烛？”黛西皱着眉头以示反对。她用手指将它们拍灭。“再过两周就要到了一年当中最长的那天了。”她一脸喜悦地看着我们。“你们是否总是盼着一年中最长的这一天到来，而过后又无比怀念呢？我总是在盼着一年中最长的这天，而过后又无比怀念。”","‘Why CANDLES?’ objected Daisy, frowning.She snapped them out with her fingers.‘In two weeks it’ll be the longest day in the year.’She looked at us all radiantly.‘Do you always watch for the longest day of the year and then miss it?I always watch for the longest day in the year and then miss it.’"
"“我们应该做点计划。”贝克小姐边打呵欠边说道，她坐在桌边的样子仿佛躺在床上一般。","‘We ought to plan something,’ yawned Miss Baker, sitting down at the table as if she were getting into bed."
"“好吧。”黛西说道，“我们做什么计划呢？”她有点无助地转向我问道，“人们都怎么计划啊？”我还没来得及开口，就看到她两眼死死盯着自己的小手指，一脸畏惧的表情。","‘All right,’ said Daisy.‘What’ll we plan?’She turned to me helplessly.‘What do people plan?’Before I could answer her eyes fastened with an awed expression on her little finger."
"“看吧！”她抱怨道，“我把它弄疼了。”","‘Look!’ she complained.‘I hurt it.’"
"我们都看到了——关节处青一块紫一块的。","We all looked—the knuckle was black and blue."
"“汤姆，都是你干的。”她带着点责怪的语气说道，“我知道你不是有意的，但你的确弄伤了我。这是我应得的，谁让我嫁了个野蛮的男人，一个高大而笨重的体育模范……”","‘You did it, Tom,’ she said accusingly.‘I know you didn’t mean to but you DID do it.That’s what I get for marrying a brute of a man, a great big hulking physical specimen of a—’"
"“我讨厌笨重这个词，”汤姆十分反感，嚷嚷道，“即便是玩笑都不可以。”","‘I hate that word hulking,’ objected Tom crossly, ‘even in kidding.’"
"“笨重。”黛西继续重复着。","‘Hulking,’ insisted Daisy."
"有时候她和贝克小姐一起开腔讲话，内容并不引人注意，都是一些不合逻辑的逗乐儿罢了，并不是什么琐碎的闲话，她们的话语正如她们的白色裙子一样淡然，也似她们那双冷淡而又无欲无求的眼睛一样冷漠。她们在这里——接待着我和汤姆，竭力礼貌而适宜地让我们开心，或者自己也寻一些开心。她们明白很快晚饭时间就过去了。再晚一会儿，一个傍晚就这样随便被打发过去了。这一切与西部的傍晚简直是大相径庭，那里傍晚从始至终都是一个乐曲接着一个乐曲地演奏，带着期望也伴着失望，有时唯恐面临结束的那一刻来得太早。","Sometimes she and Miss Baker talked at once, unobtrusively and with a bantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter, that was as cool as their white dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all desire.They were here—and they accepted Tom and me, making only a polite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained.They knew that presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening too would be over and casually put away.It was sharply different from the West where an evening was hurried from phase to phase toward its close in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in sheer nervous dread of the moment itself."
"“你让我感到自己很不文明，黛西。”我饮下第二杯夹着一点木塞味却香醇无比的葡萄酒，坦言道，“你能不能说说庄稼作物或者是什么别的呢？”","‘You make me feel uncivilized, Daisy,’ I confessed on my second glass of corky but rather impressive claret.‘Can’t you talk about crops or something?’"
"我说这些话并无他意，但这些话引起的下文出乎了我的意料。","I meant nothing in particular by this remark but it was taken up in an unexpected way."
"“文明已经濒临瓦解。”汤姆粗暴地大声吼道，“我已变成了一个可怕的悲观主义者。你有没有读过戈达德写的《有色帝国兴起》这本书?”","‘Civilization’s going to pieces,’ broke out Tom violently.‘I’ve gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things.Have you read ‘The Rise of the Coloured Empires’ by this man God-dard?’"
"“没看过，怎么了？”我回答说，他的语气让我吃了一惊。","‘Why, no,’ I answered, rather surprised by his tone."
"“嗯，这本书很好，每个人都应该读一下。书的主要思想是说如果我们不警惕，白色人种将会……将会彻底被湮没。所有这些都有科学根据，而且经过证明。”","‘Well, it’s a fine book, and everybody ought to read it.The idea is if we don’t look out the white race will be—will be utterly submerged.It’s all scientific stuff; it’s been proved.’"
"“汤姆开始变得深沉了，”黛西说道，脸上带着一种淡淡的忧伤，“他经常读一些很难懂的书，书上都是一个个长长的词。那个词叫什么来着，我们……”","‘Tom’s getting very profound,’ said Daisy with an expression of unthoughtful sadness.‘He reads deep books with long words in them.What was that word we—’"
"“嗯，这些书上讲的可全都是科学。”汤姆坚持自己的观点，同时有点不耐烦地扫了她一眼，“这家伙可是把全部道理讲得明明白白。作为占支配地位的人种，我们必须注意防范其他人种将来的统治和占领。”","‘Well, these books are all scientific,’ insisted Tom, glancing at her impatiently.‘This fellow has worked out the whole thing.It’s up to us who are the dominant race to watch out or these other races will have control of things.’"
"“我们必须将他们统统打败。”黛西一边小声嘀咕，一边朝着炽热的太阳使劲地眨巴着眼睛。","‘We’ve got to beat them down,’ whispered Daisy, winking ferociously toward the fervent sun."
"“你们应该去加利福尼亚居住……”贝克小姐刚开口说话，汤姆就一边在椅子上使劲地转了下身子，一边打断她说道：","‘You ought to live in California—’ began Miss Baker but Tom interrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair."
"“这种思想是说我们属于北欧日耳曼民族。我是，你也是，你也是，还有……”经过片刻犹豫，他点了点头，表示将黛西也包括进去了，只见黛西又向我眨了眨眼睛。“我们还制造了一切通向文明的东西——嗯，科学、艺术、还有所有的这些。你们清楚了吗？”","‘This idea is that we’re Nordics.I am, and you are and you are and—’ After an infinitesimal hesitation he included Daisy with a slight nod and she winked at me again.‘—and we’ve produced all the things that go to make civilization—oh, science and art and all that.Do you see?’"
"他那全神贯注的样子让人觉得挺可怜的，似乎他那种比往昔越发严重的高傲自满对他来说还是不够。此刻突然屋里响起了电话铃声，男管家离开了阳台进屋接电话。黛西赶紧抓住这短暂的间歇，将身子向我这边靠过来。","There was something pathetic in his concentration as if his complacency, more acute than of old, was not enough to him any more.When, almost immediately, the telephone rang inside and the butler left the porch Daisy seized upon the momentary interruption and leaned toward me."
"“我来告诉你一个家庭内部秘密，”她压低嗓子激动地说，“是关于管家鼻子的。你想不想听有关管家鼻子的秘密呢？”","‘I’ll tell you a family secret,’ she whispered enthusiasti—cally.‘It’s about the butler’s nose.Do you want to hear about the butler’s nose?’"
"“那也正是我今夜来访的原因嘛。”","‘That’s why I came over tonight.’"
"“听着，他以前可不是管家，他曾经在纽约给别人擦银器，在那里他给两百多人提供擦银器服务。他从早到晚擦呀擦，直到后来鼻子受不了了……”","‘Well, he wasn’t always a butler; he used to be the silver polisher for some people in New York that had a silver service for two hundred people.He had to polish it from morning till night until finally it began to affect his nose—"
"“情况越来越糟糕。”贝克小姐提示说。","‘Things went from bad to worse,’ suggested Miss Baker."
"“是啊，情况越来越糟糕，无奈最后他只能放弃这份工作。”","‘Yes.Things went from bad to worse until finally he had to give up his position.’"
"那一瞬间，夕阳的余晖爱抚着她那神采奕奕的脸庞。她的声音使我倾身向前，屏住呼吸，仔细聆听——随后那种神采不见了，她脸颊泛着的红光恋恋不舍地退去，仿佛小孩子在黄昏时分不舍地离开一条快乐的街道。","For a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her glowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as I listened—then the glow faded, each light deserting her with lingering regret like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk."
"男管家走回来在汤姆的耳边嘀咕了几句，汤姆便皱着眉头将椅子推开，一声不响地走进屋去了。他的离开似乎让黛西更加活跃，她再次将身子倾向前，用热情动听的声音说道：","The butler came back and murmured something close to Tom’s ear whereupon Tom frowned, pushed back his chair and without a word went inside.As if his absence quickened something within her Daisy leaned forward again, her voice glowing and singing."
"“你来我家吃饭，我真的很开心，尼克。你让我想起了一朵——一朵玫瑰花，一朵绝美的玫瑰花。是吧？”她将头转向贝克小姐，期待着她的赞同。“一朵绝美的玫瑰花？”","‘I love to see you at my table, Nick.You remind me of a—of a rose, an absolute rose.Doesn’t he?’She turned to Miss Baker for confirmation.‘An absolute rose?’"
"这真是瞎扯。我和玫瑰花真是半点都沾不上边。她仅仅是随便瞎讲，但却表现出满心的激动和热情，仿佛在她那一句句令人屏息而又激动万分的话语里，藏着一颗准备向你尽情吐露的心。接着，她突然将餐巾扔到桌上，同我们告辞，走进了屋里。","This was untrue.I am not even faintly like a rose.She was only extemporizing but a stirring warmth flowed from her as if her heart was trying to come out to you concealed in one of those breathless, thrilling words.Then suddenly she threw her napkin on the table and excused herself and went into the house."
"贝克小姐和我相互看了一下，故意避免让对方看出自己的想法。我正准备开口说话，只见她警觉地坐直身体，带有警告意味地“嘘”了一声。只听那边屋里一阵故意压低了的激动的说话声，贝克小姐毫不知羞地侧身向前倾听，试图想听到说话的内容。两人的低语交谈声一起高低起伏着，一会降了下来，一会又略带激动地高了上去，然后又一起停止了。","Miss Baker and I exchanged a short glance consciously devoid of meaning.I was about to speak when she sat up alertly and said ‘Sh!’ in a warning voice.A subdued impassioned murmur was audible in the room beyond and Miss Baker leaned forward, unashamed, trying to hear.The murmur trembled on the verge of coherence, sank down, mounted excitedly, and then ceased altogether."
"“刚刚说起的那位盖茨比先生是我的邻居——”我说道。","‘This Mr. Gatsby you spoke of is my neighbor—’ I said."
"“不要说话。我想听一下发生什么事了。”“出什么事了吗？”我带着些无知询问道。“你的意思是你什么都不知道？”贝克小姐说，显然大为惊奇，“我以为大家都知道的。”“我真不知道。”","‘Don’t talk.I want to hear what happens.’‘Is something happening?’I inquired innocently.‘You mean to say you don’t know?’ said Miss Baker, honestly surprised.‘I thought everybody knew.’‘I don’t.’"
"“嗯……”她迟疑了一下说道，“汤姆在纽约有一个女人。”","‘Why—’ she said hesitantly, ‘Tom’s got some woman in New York.’"
"“有女人？”我一脸茫然地重复道。贝克小姐点了点头。","‘Got some woman?’I repeated blankly.Miss Baker nodded."
"“她可能也不至于这么不识大体，选择在晚饭时间给他打电话吧。你觉得呢？”","‘She might have the decency not to telephone him at dinner-time.Don’t you think?’"
"我还没来得及领会她的话，就听见唰唰的衣裙飘动声以及噔噔的皮靴脚步声，紧接着，汤姆和黛西重新坐到了桌子旁。","Almost before I had grasped her meaning there was the flutter of a dress and the crunch of leather boots and Tom and Daisy were back at the table."
"“真是不可救药了！”黛西故作欢悦地大声吼道。","‘It couldn’t be helped!’ cried Daisy with tense gayety."
"她坐下来，用敏捷的目光将贝克小姐和我逐一扫视了一番之后，说道：“我到外面看了一下，外面真的很浪漫。草坪上落着一只鸟，我想它肯定是康拉德或者是白星号船上的一只夜莺。他唱着歌飞走了……”她似乎也跟着唱了起来，","She sat down, glanced searchingly at Miss Baker and then at me and continued: ‘I looked outdoors for a minute and it’s very romantic outdoors.There’s a bird on the lawn that I think must be a nightingale come over on the Cunard or White Star Line.He’s singing away—’ her voice sang"
"“真是浪漫，对吧，汤姆？”","‘—It’s romantic, isn’t it, Tom?’"
"“特别浪漫。”汤姆说。然后他又一脸可怜样地对我说：“晚饭后要是天还亮的话，我带你去看看马厩。”","‘Very romantic,’ he said, and then miserably to me: ‘If it’s light enough after dinner I want to take you down to the stables.’"
"屋内的电话铃将我们惊住了，黛西看着汤姆果断地摇了摇头。马厩的话题——其实是所有的话题——一下子消失地无影无踪。我依稀记得晚餐的最后五分钟，蜡烛无缘无故被再次点燃，我故意朝四周看了看他们，却又有意避开他们每个人的目光。我不知道黛西和汤姆当时在想什么，但我却想知道这位似乎拥有某种强硬的怀疑精神的贝克小姐，是否能完全将这第五位客人那刺耳的催促声完全置若罔闻。这种情形对于某些性情的人来讲可能还是很有意思的——我自己的本能反应是赶快给警察打电话。","The telephone rang inside, startlingly, and as Daisy shook her head decisively at Tom the subject of the stables, in fact all subjects, vanished into air.Among the broken fragments of the last five minutes at table I remember the candles being lit again, pointlessly, and I was conscious of wanting to look squarely at every one and yet to avoid all eyes.I couldn’t guess what Daisy and Tom were thinking but I doubt if even Miss Baker who seemed to have mastered a certain hardy skepticism was able utterly to put this fifth guest’s shrill metallic urgency out of mind.To a certain temperament the situation might have seemed intriguing—my own instinct was to telephone immediately for the police."
"不用说，再也没有提起马了。汤姆和贝克小姐一前一后悠闲地走回书房去了，他们之间几英尺的距离被暮色笼罩着。他们的样子像是要去值夜班看守一个实实在在的躯体。而我则装出很开心又很感兴趣的样子，像什么都没发生一样，跟着黛西走出一连串的走廊，来到房子前面的走廊上。我们在灰暗的黄昏中并肩坐在一张柳条编的靠背长椅上。","The horses, needless to say, were not mentioned again.Tom and Miss Baker, with several feet of twilight between them strolled back into the library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while trying to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf I followed Daisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front.In its deep gloom we sat down side by side on a wicker settee."
"黛西双手托着自己的脸颊，似乎在抚摸着自己那秀美的轮廓，而她的双眼渐渐抬起，向黄昏柔和的暮色望去。我能感觉到她心神不定，于是就问了一些关于她女儿的事情，以使她平静下来。“我们彼此并不了解，尼克。”她突然说道，“虽然我们是表兄妹。你没有来参加我的婚礼。”","Daisy took her face in her hands, as if feeling its lovely shape, and her eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk.I saw that turbulent emotions possessed her, so I asked what I thought would be some sedative questions about her little girl.‘We don’t know each other very well, Nick,’ she said suddenly.‘Even if we are cousins.You didn’t come to my wedding.’"
"“我那时还没有从战场回来。”","‘I wasn’t back from the war.’"
"“确实如此。”她犹豫了一下，“唉，我过得并不开心，尼克，而且非常愤世嫉俗。”","‘That’s true.’She hesitated.‘Well, I’ve had a very bad time, Nick, and I’m pretty cynical about everything.’"
"显然她的愤世嫉俗是有原因的。我等她继续往下说，但是她却没有多说。过了一会儿，我没办法就只好又开始聊起她的女儿：","Evidently she had reason to be.I waited but she didn’t say any more, and after a moment I returned rather feebly to the subject of her daughter."
"“我猜她已经会说话了，而且……会吃东西了，应该什么都会了吧。”","‘I suppose she talks, and—eats, and everything.’"
"“嗯，对。”她茫然地看着我，“听着，尼克，我来告诉你她出生的时候我都说了些什么。你想不想听啊？”","‘Oh, yes.’She looked at me absently.‘Listen, Nick; let me tell you what I said when she was born.Would you like to hear?’"
"“很想。”","‘Very much.’"
"“听了这些你就会知道我是怎样感觉——这些事情的。她刚出生不到一小时，天知道汤姆跑到哪里去了。我从麻醉中刚苏醒过来，就感到自己完全被遗弃了，立即问护士孩子是男孩还是女孩。她告诉我是女孩，于是我转过头，泪水流了下来。‘好，’我说，‘我很开心生了个女孩。而且我希望她以后是个傻瓜——在这个世界上，这是女孩最好的选择——一个漂亮的小傻瓜。’”","‘It’ll show you how I’ve gotten to feel about—things.Well, she was less than an hour old and Tom was God knows where.I woke up out of the ether with an utterly abandoned feeling and asked the nurse right away if it was a boy or a girl.She told me it was a girl, and so I turned my head away and wept.‘All right,’ I said, ‘I’m glad it’s a girl.And I hope she’ll be a fool—that’s the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful little fool.’"
"“你看，我觉得所有一切都让人厌恶。”她用确信的口吻继续讲道，“大家都这么想——那些最先进的人中大部分都这么想。而且我明白，我所有的地方都去过了，所有一切都见过了，所有的事情也都做过了。”她的眼睛向四周扫射了一圈，那种目中无人的神情真有点像汤姆。接着，她笑了起来，带着一种可怕的轻蔑：“老于世故……我的天啊，我真是老于世故。”","‘You see I think everything’s terrible anyhow,’ she went on in a convinced way.‘Everybody thinks so—the most advanced people.And I KNOW. I’ve been everywhere and seen everything and done everything.’Her eyes flashed around her in a defiant way, rather like Tom’s, and she laughed with thrilling scorn.‘Sophisticated—God, I’m sophisticated!’"
"她的声音停止的瞬间，一种迫使我关注她和信任她的东西消失了，我才觉得她刚才的话有点虚伪。我感到非常不自在，似乎整个傍晚发生的一切只不过是一个骗局，欺骗了我的真心与感情。我等了一会儿，她开始看着我，果然她那妩媚的脸上露出了得意的笑，仿佛在很肯定地告诉我，她是那个她和汤姆同属的神秘上流社会中的一份子。","The instant her voice broke off, ceasing to compel my attention, my belief, I felt the basic insincerity of what she had said.It made me uneasy, as though the whole evening had been a trick of some sort to exact a contributory emotion from me.I waited, and sure enough, in a moment she looked at me with an absolute smirk on her lovely face as if she had asserted her membership in a rather distinguished secret society to which she and Tom belonged."
"里面那绯红色的房间被灯光映得无比明亮辉煌。汤姆和贝克小姐坐在那个长沙发的两端，贝克小姐在为汤姆朗读着《星期六晚邮报》——声音不大，语调平稳，听起来心里有种暖暖的感觉。灯光照着他锃亮的皮靴，同时也照到她那如秋叶般暗黄的头发上。她轻轻抬起纤细的手臂翻过一页书时，灯光在那翻动的纸张上闪耀。","Inside, the crimson room bloomed with light.Tom and Miss Baker sat at either end of the long couch and she read aloud to him from the ‘Saturday Evening Post’—the words, murmurous and uninflected, running together in a soothing tune.The lamp-light, bright on his boots and dull on the autumn-leaf yellow of her hair, glinted along the paper as she turned a page with a flutter of slender muscles in her arms."
"但我们走进屋的时候，她举起一只手示意我们要暂时保持安静。","When we came in she held us silent for a moment with a lifted hand."
"“预知下文，”她边把杂志扔到桌上边说，“请听下期再续。”","‘To be continued,’ she said, tossing the magazine on the table, ‘in our very next issue.’"
"她动了动膝盖，将上身挺直，接着就站了起来。","Her body asserted itself with a restless movement of her knee, and she stood up."
"“十点钟啦，”她说道，显然看到了天花板上的钟，“该是好孩子上床休息的时候啦。”","‘Ten o’clock,’ she remarked, apparently finding the time on the ceiling.‘Time for this good girl to go to bed.’"
"“明天乔丹要参加锦标赛，”黛西解释说，“在威斯切斯特。”","‘Jordan’s going to play in the tournament tomorrow,’ explained Daisy, ‘over at Westchester.’"
"“哦……你是乔丹·贝克。”","‘Oh,—you’re JORdan Baker.’"
"我此刻才明白为什么她的脸庞看起来那么熟悉——在很多关于阿希维尔、温泉和棕榈海滩的体育生活报道的凹版图片上，我都看到过她的照片，她的表情总是讨人喜爱却又高傲。我曾经也听说过一些关于她的报道，一些批判性的负面报道，但我早就忘了内容是什么了。","I knew now why her face was familiar—its pleasing contemptuous expression had looked out at me from many rotogravure pictures of the sporting life at Asheville and Hot Springs and Palm Beach.I had heard some story of her too, a critical, unpleasant story, but what it was I had forgotten long ago."
"“晚安。”她温柔地说，“明早八点叫我起床，好不好？”","‘Good night,’ she said softly.‘Wake me at eight, won’t you?’"
"“如果你可以起得来的话。”","‘If you’ll get up.’"
"“我一定可以。晚安，卡拉韦先生。希望下次再见。”","‘I will.Good night, Mr. Carraway.See you anon.’"
"“你们当然会再见啦。”黛西肯定地说道，“实话说我还想给你俩做媒呢。经常过来嘛，尼克，然后我就可以——嗯——将你俩撮合到一起。就是说——碰巧将你俩一起锁在床上用品储物室啦，或把你俩放在一艘小船里推进海里啦，以及一系列类似的意外巧合。”","‘Of course you will,’ confirmed Daisy.‘In fact I think I’ll arrange a marriage.Come over often, Nick, and I’ll sort of—oh—fling you together.You know—lock you up accidentally in linen closets and push you out to sea in a boat, and all that sort of thing—’"
"“晚安。”贝克小姐站在楼梯上说道，“我可什么都没听见。”","‘Good night,’ called Miss Baker from the stairs.‘I haven’t heard a word.’"
"“她是一个好女孩。”过了一会儿，汤姆开口说道，“他们不该让她这样全国到处跑。”","‘She’s a nice girl,’ said Tom after a moment.‘They oughtn’t to let her run around the country this way.’"
"“谁不该让她到处跑？”黛西冷淡地问。","‘Who oughtn’t to?’ inquired Daisy coldly."
"“她的家人。”","‘Her family.’"
"“她家人就是一个七老八十的姨妈。而且，尼克将来要照顾她，对不对，尼克？今年夏天她许多周末都是在这儿度过的。我觉得这种家庭氛围对她的影响将会让她受益。”","‘Her family is one aunt about a thousand years old.Besides, Nick’s going to look after her, aren’t you, Nick?She’s going to spend lots of week-ends out here this summer.I think the home influence will be very good for her.’"
"黛西和汤姆都沉默着相互对视了片刻。","Daisy and Tom looked at each other for a moment in silence."
"“她是纽约人吗？”我迅速问道。","‘Is she from New York?’I asked quickly."
"“是路易斯维尔人。我们纯真的少女时代就是在那儿一起度过的。我们美丽纯真的……”","‘From Louisville.Our white girlhood was passed together there.Our beautiful white—’"
"“在阳台上你有没有和尼克说说心里话？”汤姆冷不丁地问道。“我有没有？”她看着我，“我好像记不得了，不过我觉得我们谈到了北欧日耳曼民族。是，我们确实谈到了这个。也没注意怎么就谈到这里了，而且开始的时候……”","‘Did you give Nick a little heart to heart talk on the veranda?’ demanded Tom suddenly.‘Did I?’She looked at me.‘I can’t seem to remember, but I think we talked about the Nordic race.Yes, I’m sure we did.It sort of crept up on us and first thing you know—’"
"“不要听到什么都信以为真，尼克。”他劝诫我说。","‘Don’t believe everything you hear, Nick,’ he advised me."
"我随意地说自己什么都没听到。又过了几分钟，我便起身要回家了。他们送我走到门口，并排站在令人愉悦的灯光下。我刚启动发动机，黛西急切地喊道：“等一下！","I said lightly that I had heard nothing at all, and a few minutes later I got up to go home.They came to the door with me and stood side by side in a cheerful square of light.As I started my motor Daisy peremptorily called ‘Wait!"
"我刚才忘了问你一件事，很重要的一件事。我们听说你同西部的一个女孩订婚了。”","‘I forgot to ask you something, and it’s important.We heard you were engaged to a girl out West.’"
"“对，”汤姆亲切地附和着，“我们是听说你订婚了。”","‘That’s right,’ corroborated Tom kindly.‘We heard that you were engaged.’"
"“那是无中生有的事。我太穷了。”","‘It’s libel.I’m too poor.’"
"“但是我们确实听说了。”黛西坚持说道，她那如花绽放的神态让我惊讶不已，“我们都听三个人说了，所以肯定是真的。”","‘But we heard it,’ insisted Daisy, surprising me by opening up again in a flower-like way.‘We heard it from three people so it must be true.’"
"当然我明白他们在说什么，但是我的的确确没订婚。事实上关于订婚的流言蜚语也是我决定来东部的原因之一。你不可能因为流言蜚语而与老朋友断绝关系，可是我也不想在别人的谣言下结婚。","Of course I knew what they were referring to, but I wasn’t even vaguely engaged.The fact that gossip had published the banns was one of the reasons I had come east.You can’t stop going with an old friend on account of rumors and on the other hand I had no intention of being rumored into marriage."
"他们对此事的兴趣倒使我有点感动，这种关心让他们不再显得那么高高在上——即便如此，驾车回家的路上，我还是有些困惑，甚至有点反感。在我看来，黛西应该抱上孩子赶快离开那座房子——然而，显然她的脑海里根本没有这种想法。至于汤姆，与其说“他在纽约有女人”这个事实让我吃惊，倒不如说他由于读了一本书而变得无比沮丧更让我难以理解。某些东西让他将那些陈腐的思想当成了精神食粮，似乎他强壮的体魄中的那种自负已无法为他那颗狂妄自大的心提供养分。","Their interest rather touched me and made them less remotely rich—nevertheless, I was confused and a little disgusted as I drove away.It seemed to me that the thing for Daisy to do was to rush out of the house, child in arms—but apparently there were no such intentions in her head.As for Tom, the fact that he ‘had some woman in New York’ was really less surprising than that he had been depressed by a book.Something was making him nibble at the edge of stale ideas as if his sturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his peremptory heart."
"路边客栈的屋顶上已经是一片盛夏的景象，修车厂门前明亮的灯光下有一台台崭新鲜红的油泵。到了西卵的住处后，我把车停在车棚里，出来在院子里废弃的除草机上坐了一会儿。风已停息，夜晚显得更加喧闹而明亮，有鸟儿挥动翅膀拍打树枝的声音，也有青蛙在大地的咆哮声中攒足了劲儿发出的持续不断的叫声，如风琴一般。一只在月光中移动的猫的轮廓吸引了我的视线，我转过头去看的时候，发现自己并不是一个人——五十英尺以外的地方，一个人从邻居豪宅的阴影下走出来，他双手插到衣兜里站在那儿，凝视着满天银白色的星斗。他那有些悠闲的动作，还有双脚踏在草坪上那安详的姿势告诉我，他就是盖茨比先生本人，他出来是要确定一下这儿的哪一片天空属于他。","Already it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs and in front of wayside garages, where new red gas-pumps sat out in pools of light, and when I reached my estate at West Egg I ran the car under its shed and sat for a while on an abandoned grass roller in the yard.The wind had blown off, leaving a loud bright night with wings beating in the trees and a persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth blew the frogs full of life.The silhouette of a moving cat wavered across the moonlight and turning my head to watch it I saw that I was not alone—fifty feet away a figure had emerged from the shadow of my neighbor’s mansion and was standing with his hands in his pockets regarding the silver pepper of the stars.Something in his leisurely movements and the secure position of his feet upon the lawn suggested that it was Mr. Gatsby himself, come out to determine what share was his of our local heavens."
"我决定和他打个招呼。贝克小姐晚饭的时候提到过他，这也许可以当作引荐了。但是我并没有和他打招呼，因为他一个突然的动作让我感到他在享受着一个人独处的快乐——他古怪地将自己的双手伸向幽暗的海水，虽然我当时离他很远，我敢肯定我看到他在发抖。我也不知不觉地向海上望去——我什么都看不清楚，除了很远的地方一盏闪着微光的绿灯，也许那儿便是码头的尽头吧。我再次回头寻找盖茨比的时候，他已经不见了。在这喧闹漆黑的夜里再次剩下了我独自一人。","I decided to call to him.Miss Baker had mentioned him at dinner, and that would do for an introduction.But I didn’t call to him for he gave a sudden intimation that he was content to be alone—he stretched out his arms toward the dark water in a curious way, and far as I was from him I could have sworn he was trembling.Involuntarily I glanced seaward—and distinguished nothing except a single green light, minute and far away, that might have been the end of a dock.When I looked once more for Gatsby he had vanished, and I was alone again in the unquiet darkness."
"第二章","Chapter 2"
"在从西卵去纽约中间一半路程的地方，公路突然和铁路匆匆会合，而且为了避开一片荒芜的空地，公路顺着铁路延伸了足有四分之一英里长。这是一个飞灰笼罩的山谷——灰烬从一个离奇古怪的农场如同小麦一样生长开来，长成了山脉，长成了小丘，长成了怪异的花园，灰烬在这些地方又变成了房子，烟囱，袅袅炊烟，最后又使尽浑身解数变成了一个个模模糊糊走动着的人，这些人又已经在灰粉飞舞的空气里化为灰烬。偶尔有一排灰色的汽车沿着一条看不清楚的路线缓慢爬行，在一阵怪异的嘎吱声中停了下来，停下瞬间只见一群浑身是灰的人带着铁锹蜂拥而上，他们搅起漫天灰尘，让你根本看不清楚他们到底在干什么。","About half way between West Egg and New York the motor-road hastily joins the railroad and runs beside it for a quarter of a mile, so as to shrink away from a certain desolate area of land.This is a valley of ashes—a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque gardens where ashes take the forms of houses and chimneys and rising smoke and finally, with a transcendent effort, of men who move dimly and already crumbling through the powdery air.Occasionally a line of grey cars crawls along an invisible track, gives out a ghastly creak and comes to rest, and immediately the ash-grey men swarm up with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable cloud which screens their obscure operations from your sight."
"但是在这片灰蒙蒙的土地上，在无休止地飘荡于其上的一阵阵尘土之上，不久你就会看到T.J.埃克尔堡大夫的一双眼睛。T.J.埃克尔堡大夫那蓝色的眼睛犹如巨人一般——视网膜就足有一码高。眼睛周围看不到脸庞，只看见一副被一个根本看不见的鼻子支撑起来的巨大的眼镜。毫无疑问那是一个异想天开的眼科医生为了在女王行政区增加自己的业务，故意将它们立起来的，后来那医生自己没落消失了，或是将它们遗忘在此，自己搬走了。然而他的这两只眼睛经过长年累月的日晒雨淋已经暗淡无光了，却依旧若有所思地凝望着这块废弃的土地。","But above the grey land and the spasms of bleak dust which drift endlessly over it, you perceive, after a moment, the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg.The eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg are blue and gigantic—their retinas are one yard high.They look out of no face but, instead, from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a nonexistent nose.Evidently some wild wag of an oculist set them there to fatten his practice in the borough of Queens, and then sank down himself into eternal blindness or forgot them and moved away.But his eyes, dimmed a little by many paintless days under sun and rain, brood on over the sol—emn dumping ground."
"这个灰尘飞扬的峡谷一边有一条又脏又臭的小河，当吊桥打开驳船通行的时候，等在一边的火车上的乘客就会对着这一惨淡的景象注视上半个小时。一般在那里经过的火车至少都要停一分钟。正因如此，我才第一次见到了汤姆·布坎南的情妇。","The valley of ashes is bounded on one side by a small foul river, and when the drawbridge is up to let barges through, the passengers on waiting trains can stare at the dismal scene for as long as half an hour.There is always a halt there of at least a minute and it was because of this that I first met Tom Buchanan’s mistress."
"认识他的人都确信他在外面有情妇的事实。让那些认识他的人都愤怒不已的是，他经常带着她去流行餐馆就餐，然后将她一个人丢在餐桌旁，自己到处走动找熟人聊天。虽然我对于她的样子感到很好奇，我并不想和她见面——但是我却见到了她。一天下午，我和汤姆一同坐火车去纽约。刚好一个灰土堆将车挡住了，车刚一停他就跳起来，一把抓住我的胳膊，将我生拉硬扯地拖出了车外。","The fact that he had one was insisted upon wherever he was known.His acquaintances resented the fact that he turned up in popular restaurants with her and, leaving her at a table, sauntered about, chatting with whomsoever he knew.Though I was curious to see her I had no desire to meet her—but I did.I went up to New York with Tom on the train one afternoon and when we stopped by the ashheaps he jumped to his feet and taking hold of my elbow literally forced me from the car."
"“我们现在下车！”他坚决地说道，“我想给你介绍一下我的女朋友。”","‘We’re getting off!’ he insisted.‘I want you to meet my girl.’"
"我觉得他午饭的时候肯定是喝多了，他让我陪他见女朋友的决心接近于暴力行事了。他可能极其傲慢地认为我在周末的下午没有什么别的事情好干的了。","I think he’d tanked up a good deal at luncheon and his determination to have my company bordered on violence.The supercilious assumption was that on Sunday afternoon I had nothing better to do."
"我跟着他跨过一排矮矮的白色铁路栏杆，然后在埃克尔堡大夫的注视下沿着公路往回走了一百码。眼前能看到的唯一建筑是一座黄砖砌成的小屋，边上是一块废地，看上去像是一条小型的商业街，附近便再无他物。街上有三家商店，一家是待租的，另外一家是门前尘灰飞扬的通宵饭店，最后一家是一个修车厂。乔治·B.威尔森。买卖汽车——我跟着汤姆走了进去。","I followed him over a low white-washed railroad fence and we walked back a hundred yards along the road under Doctor Eckleburg’s persistent stare.The only building in sight was a small block of yellow brick sitting on the edge of the waste land, a sort of compact Main Street ministering to it and contiguous to absolutely nothing.One of the three shops it contained was for rent and another was an all-night restaurant approached by a trail of ashes; the third was a garage—Repairs.GEORGE B. WILSON. Cars Bought and Sold—and I followed Tom inside."
"里面空空的没什么生意，只能看见一辆灰尘覆盖着的破旧不堪的福特，停在一个阴暗角落。我突然觉得这个名不副实的修车厂一定是一种掩饰，上面一定还隐藏着一座奢华浪漫的别墅。这时，老板出现在办公处的门口，用一张废纸擦着双手。那个男的满头黄发，无精打采，脸上气色不好，但长相还可以。他一看到我们，淡蓝色的眼睛便掠过一丝暗淡的希望。","The interior was unprosperous and bare; the only car visible was the dust-covered wreck of a Ford which crouched in a dim corner.It had occurred to me that this shadow of a garage must be a blind and that sumptuous and romantic apartments were concealed overhead when the proprietor himself appeared in the door of an office, wiping his hands on a piece of waste.He was a blonde, spiritless man, anaemic, and faintly handsome.When he saw us a damp gleam of hope sprang into his light blue eyes."
"“嘿，威尔森，老兄。”汤姆边说边高兴地拍着他的肩膀，“生意还好吧？”","‘Hello, Wilson, old man,’ said Tom, slapping him jovially on the shoulder.‘How’s business?’"
"“一般啦。”威尔森有点没底气地说道，“你打算什么时候把那辆车卖给我啊？”","‘I can’t complain,’ answered Wilson unconvincingly.‘When are you going to sell me that car?’"
"“下周吧，我已经找了人正在修理呢。”","‘Next week; I’ve got my man working on it now.’"
"“那他干活够慢的，是吧？”","‘Works pretty slow, doesn’t he?’"
"“不啊，他不慢。”汤姆冷淡地说道，“如果你觉得慢的话，也许我只好到别的地方去卖了。”","‘No, he doesn’t,’ said Tom coldly.‘And if you feel that way about it, maybe I’d better sell it somewhere else after all.’"
"“我并不是那个意思，“威尔森赶快解释说，“我只是说……”","‘I don’t mean that,’ explained Wilson quickly.‘I just meant—’"
"他的声音渐渐低了下去，而汤姆不耐烦地朝修车厂四周打望。随后我听到楼梯上响起了脚步声。过了一会儿，一个女人臃肿的身体将办公室门口的光线挡住了。她三十多岁，身材微胖，却像其他女人一样挑逗地将身子挺得直直的，看上去很美。她穿着一件带有污渍的深蓝色双绉连衣裙，脸庞并不滑嫩也不娇美，却散发着一种明显的活力，似乎她身上的每一处神经都在不停地燃烧。她慢慢微笑着，从她丈夫的身边走过，仿佛她的丈夫并不存在。她走到汤姆跟前同他握了握手，双眼直直地盯着他。然后她润了润嘴唇，头也不回便低声粗气地对她丈夫说：","His voice faded off and Tom glanced impatiently around the garage.Then I heard footsteps on a stairs and in a moment the thickish figure of a woman blocked out the light from the office door.She was in the middle thirties, and faintly stout, but she carried her surplus flesh sensuously as some women can.Her face, above a spotted dress of dark blue crepe-de-chine, contained no facet or gleam of beauty but there was an immediately perceptible vitality about her as if the nerves of her body were continually smouldering.She smiled slowly and walking through her husband as if he were a ghost shook hands with Tom, looking him flush in the eye.Then she wet her lips and without turning around spoke to her husband in a soft, coarse voice:"
"“拿两把椅子过来，让客人坐下啊。”","‘Get some chairs, why don’t you, so somebody can sit down.’"
"“哦，对。”威尔森赶忙答应着走向那间小办公室，他的背影瞬间在水泥色的墙壁中消失。白灰色的尘埃遮掩了他深色的西装，遮掩了他银灰的头发，遮掩了附近的一切一切——除了那位走向汤姆的他的妻子。","‘Oh, sure,’ agreed Wilson hurriedly and went toward the little office, mingling immediately with the cement color of the walls.A white ashen dust veiled his dark suit and his pale hair as it veiled everything in the vicinity—except his wife, who moved close to Tom."
"“我很想见你。”汤姆热切地说，“坐下班火车走吧。”","‘I want to see you,’ said Tom intently.‘Get on the next train.’"
"“好的。”","‘All right.’"
"“我们在车站下面的报刊摊旁见面。”","‘I’ll meet you by the news-stand on the lower level.’"
"她点了点头就转身回去了，这时乔治·威尔森拿着两把椅子正从办公室走出来。","She nodded and moved away from him just as George Wilson emerged with two chairs from his office door."
"我们在公路边上一个僻静的地方等她。距离七月四日还有几天，于是看见一个满身灰尘、瘦骨嶙峋的意大利小孩在沿着铁路轨道放了一排信号雷管。","We waited for her down the road and out of sight.It was a few days before the Fourth of July, and a grey, scrawny Italian child was setting torpedoes in a row along the railroad track."
"“这个地方真可怕，是吧。”汤姆边说边皱着眉头与埃克尔堡大夫对视着。“糟糕透顶。”","‘Terrible place, isn’t it,’ said Tom, exchanging a frown with Doctor Eckleburg.‘Awful.’"
"“离开这儿对她还好一点。”“他丈夫不反对吗？”","‘It does her good to get away.’‘Doesn’t her husband object?’"
"“威尔森吗？他认为她要去纽约看望妹妹。他极其愚钝，连自己的存活都感觉不到。”","‘Wilson?He thinks she goes to see her sister in New York.He’s so dumb he doesn’t know he’s alive.’"
"就这样汤姆·布坎南和他的情妇还有我一起同行去纽约——或者说并不是同行，因为威尔森夫人为谨慎起见坐到了另外一个车厢。汤姆对此让步妥协，也是避免火车上有一些极其敏感的东卵人有所察觉。","So Tom Buchanan and his girl and I went up together to New York—or not quite together, for Mrs. Wilson sat discreetly in another car.Tom deferred that much to the sensibilities of those East Eggers who might be on the train."
"她换穿了一件带花的棕色棉布连衣裙，当汤姆在纽约站将她扶下车的时候，只见她的裙子紧紧地绷在了她那肥大的臀部上。在一个报摊上，她买了一份《纽约闲话》和一份画报，在车站边上的药店里又买了一瓶冷霜和一小细瓶香水。在楼上那阴暗且有回音的车道上，她放走了四辆出租车，最后才等来一辆淡紫色且内置灰色坐垫的新车。乘着这辆车，我们挤出了拥挤的车站，看到了明媚的阳光。可是突然她转向车窗，然后将身体前倾敲打着前窗玻璃。","She had changed her dress to a brown figured muslin which stretched tight over her rather wide hips as Tom helped her to the platform in New York.At the news-stand she bought a copy of ‘Town Tattle’ and a moving-picture magazine and, in the station drug store, some cold cream and a small flask of perfume.Upstairs, in the solemn echoing drive she let four taxi cabs drive away before she selected a new one, lavender-colored with grey upholstery, and in this we slid out from the mass of the station into the glowing sunshine.But immediately she turned sharply from the window and leaning forward tapped on the front glass."
"“我想要一条那样的狗，”她急切地说，“我想买一条养在公寓里。那些狗养起来感觉一定很好——一条狗。”","‘I want to get one of those dogs,’ she said earnestly.‘I want to get one for the apartment.They’re nice to have—a dog.’"
"我们将车倒到一位满头银发的老人面前。很滑稽的是，那位老人长得非常像约翰·D.洛克菲勒。他的脖子上晃荡着一个筐子，里面抖缩着十几只刚刚出生且品种不明的狗崽。","We backed up to a grey old man who bore an absurd resemblance to John D. Rockefeller.In a basket, swung from his neck, cowered a dozen very recent puppies of an indeterminate breed."
"“它们是什么品种的？”老头刚走到出租车车窗旁，威尔森夫人便急切地问。","‘What kind are they?’ asked Mrs. Wilson eagerly as he came to the taxi-window."
"“什么品种都有。夫人，您想要什么品种的？”","‘All kinds.What kind do you want, lady?’"
"“我想买只警犬，我觉得你可能没有那个品种吧？”老人半信半疑地朝筐里瞅瞅，掐住一只狗的脖子，晃晃悠悠地将其拽了出来。","‘I’d like to get one of those police dogs; I don’t suppose you got that kind?’The man peered doubtfully into the basket, plunged in his hand and drew one up, wriggling, by the back of the neck."
"“那根本不是警犬。”汤姆说。","‘That’s no police dog,’ said Tom."
"“不是，这可能不是警犬。”老人声音带着几分失落说道，“这多数是只艾尔达犬。”他用手摸着狗背上毛巾般的棕色皮毛：“你看看这毛。多好的毛啊。你永远不用操心它会感冒。”","‘No, it’s not exactly a polICE dog,’ said the man with disappointment in his voice.‘It’s more of an airedale.’He passed his hand over the brown wash-rag of a back.‘Look at that coat.Some coat.That’s a dog that’ll never bother you with catching cold.’"
"“我觉得它挺可爱的。”威尔森夫人激动地说，“多少钱啊？”","‘I think it’s cute,’ said Mrs. Wilson enthusiastically.‘How much is it?’"
"“这只狗？”他用爱慕的目光看了看狗，“这条狗卖十美元。”","‘That dog?’He looked at it admiringly.‘That dog will cost you ten dollars.’"
"这只艾尔达犬——虽然四个爪子是让人震惊的白色，毫无疑问还是带有艾尔达犬血统——威尔森夫人将它接过来放在大腿上，欣喜若狂地抚摸着它那结实的皮毛。","The airedale—undoubtedly there was an airedale concerned in it somewhere though its feet were startlingly white—changed hands and settled down into Mrs. Wilson’s lap, where she fondled the weather-proof coat with rapture."
"“是雄的还是雌的？”她用轻柔的声音问道。","‘Is it a boy or a girl?’ she asked delicately."
"“那狗吗？那是只雄狗。”","‘That dog?That dog’s a boy.’"
"“那是只雌的。”汤姆坚定地说，“给你钱。拿着再去买十只回来。”","‘It’s a bitch,’ said Tom decisively.‘Here’s your money.Go and buy ten more dogs with it.’"
"我们乘车来到第五大道，那是夏日里一个温暖而舒适的周日下午，周围感觉像田园一般，所以即便在拐角处走出来一大群雪白的绵羊也不足为奇。","We drove over to Fifth Avenue, so warm and soft, almost pastoral, on the summer Sunday afternoon that I wouldn’t have been surprised to see a great flock of white sheep turn the corner."
"“等一下，”我说，“我得在这儿下车。”","‘Hold on,’ I said, ‘I have to leave you here.’"
"“不，你不能下。”汤姆赶忙插嘴说，“你不来公寓看看，默特尔会不开心的。是不是啊，","‘No, you don’t,’ interposed Tom quickly.‘Myrtle’ll be hurt if you don’t come up to the apartment.Won’t you,"
"默特尔？”“来嘛。”她恳求我说，“我给妹妹凯瑟琳打个电话，叫她也来。有眼光的人都夸她长得好看。”","Myrtle?’‘Come on,’ she urged.‘I’ll telephone my sister Catherine.She’s said to be very beautiful by people who ought to know.’"
"“嗯，我很想去，可是……”","‘Well, I’d like to, but—’"
"我们继续往前走，又绕回来穿过了公园，朝着城西一百多号街走去。车在一百五十八号街，一排白色的蛋糕状公寓其中的一栋前停了下来。威尔森夫人如同皇后回宫一般向四周扫视了一下，便抱起她的狗，拎着其他所购物品，趾高气昂地走了进去。","We went on, cutting back again over the Park toward the West Hundreds.At 158th Street the cab stopped at one slice in a long white cake of apartment houses.Throwing a regal homecoming glance around the neighborhood, Mrs. Wilson gathered up her dog and her other purchases and went haughtily in."
"“我要请麦基夫妇上来。”她边上电梯边宣布道，“当然我还要打电话叫妹妹过来。”","‘I’m going to have the McKees come up,’ she announced as we rose in the elevator.‘And of course I got to call up my sister, too.’"
"公寓在顶楼——一间小客厅、一间小饭厅、一间小卧室还有一个洗澡间。客厅里的一大套织锦家具一直摆到门口，整个客厅挤得满满的，走起来时不时地会被织有凡尔赛宫荡秋千侍女的布景绊倒。墙上唯一的画是一张特殊放大的照片，看上去像是一只母鸡蹲在一块有点模糊的石头上。但是从远处看，母鸡变成了一顶女帽，一个又矮又胖的老妇人眉开眼笑，俯视着屋子。桌上扔着几本过期的《纽约闲话》，还有一本《名字叫彼得的西门》，以及一些百老汇的八卦杂志。威尔森夫人先是关心她的小狗去了。一个电梯工极不情愿地跑去买了一个装满稻草的盒子和一些牛奶，还擅自做主买了一罐又硬又大的狗食饼干，其中一块饼干被放在牛奶碟里一下午泡地稀巴烂。这时，汤姆打开上锁的橱柜门，取出一瓶威士忌酒。","The apartment was on the top floor—a small living room, a small dining room, a small bedroom and a bath.The living room was crowded to the doors with a set of tapestried furniture entirely too large for it so that to move about was to stumble continually over scenes of ladies swinging in the gardens of Versailles.The only picture was an over-enlarged photograph, apparently a hen sitting on a blurred rock.Looked at from a distance however the hen resolved itself into a bonnet and the countenance of a stout old lady beamed down into the room.Several old copies of ‘Town Tattle ‘lay on the table together with a copy of ‘Simon Called Peter’ and some of the small scandal magazines of Broadway.Mrs. Wilson was first concerned with the dog.A reluctant elevator boy went for a box full of straw and some milk to which he added on his own initiative a tin of large hard dog biscuits—one of which decomposed apathetically in the saucer of milk all afternoon.Meanwhile Tom brought out a bottle of whiskey from a locked bureau door."
"我平生只醉过两次，那天下午是我第二次喝醉，因此那天发生的一切都已经模模糊糊地记不清楚了，尽管那天公寓里直到八点以后还是阳光明媚。威尔森夫人坐在汤姆的大腿上给几个人打了电话。随后没香烟了，我就出去到街角的药店买香烟。我回来的时候，他们不见了，于是我就悄悄地坐在客厅读了一章《名字叫彼得的西门》——不知道是书写地太烂了，还是喝威士忌喝多了，我看了半天什么也没读懂。","I have been drunk just twice in my life and the second time was that afternoon so everything that happened has a dim hazy cast over it although until after eight o’clock the apartment was full of cheerful sun.Sitting on Tom’s lap Mrs. Wilson called up several people on the telephone; then there were no cigarettes and I went out to buy some at the drug store on the corner.When I came back they had disappeared so I sat down discreetly in the living room and read a chapter of ‘Simon Called Peter’—either it was terrible stuff or the whiskey distorted things because it didn’t make any sense to me."
"汤姆和默特尔（喝完第一杯酒，威尔森夫人和我就以名字称呼对方了。）再次露面时，客人们就一个接着一个来到了公寓。","Just as Tom and Myrtle—after the first drink Mrs. Wilson and I called each other by our first names—reappeared, company commenced to arrive at the apartment door."
"她的妹妹凯瑟琳三十岁左右，身材苗条却长得十分俗气，一头浓密的红色短发，擦了粉的脸像牛奶一样白。她的眉毛是拔了之后又画了流线形的角，但是自然的那种恢复原貌的力量使她的脸显得有点眉目不清。她走动的时候，胳膊上一堆劣质玉镯上下晃动，叮叮当当地响个不停。她像主人似的大摇大摆地走了进来，环顾四周家具的眼神像是在看自己的东西一般，这倒让我怀疑她是否就住这里。但是当我问她的时候，她边重复我的问题边哈哈大笑，随后告诉我她和一个女性朋友住在一家旅店。","The sister, Catherine, was a slender, worldly girl of about thirty with a solid sticky bob of red hair and a complexion powdered milky white.Her eyebrows had been plucked and then drawn on again at a more rakish angle but the efforts of nature toward the restoration of the old alignment gave a blurred air to her face.When she moved about there was an incessant clicking as innumerable pottery bracelets jingled up and down upon her arms.She came in with such a proprietary haste and looked around so possessively at the furniture that I wondered if she lived here.But when I asked her she laughed immoderately, repeated my question aloud and told me she lived with a girl friend at a hotel."
"麦基先生是一位像女人一样白净的男人，他就住楼下。他显然是刚刚刮过胡子，颊骨上还留着一小块白色的皂沫。他表现得最恭敬了，进来和每一个人都一一打了招呼。他告诉我他是从事“艺术行业”的，后来我才知道他是个摄影师。墙上的那张放大后仿佛外胚般模糊不清的威尔森夫人母亲的照片就是他的作品。她的妻子声音尖锐刺耳，一副无精打采的样子，虽说相貌俊俏但却非常惹人讨厌。她得意地告诉我们，从他们结婚以来，她的丈夫已为她拍过一百二十七次照片了。","Mr. McKee was a pale feminine man from the flat below.He had just shaved for there was a white spot of lather on his cheekbone and he was most respectful in his greeting to everyone in the room.He informed me that he was in the ‘artistic game’ and I gathered later that he was a photographer and had made the dim enlargement of Mrs. Wilson’s mother which hovered like an ectoplasm on the wall.His wife was shrill, languid, handsome and horrible.She told me with pride that her husband had photographed her a hundred and twenty-seven times since they had been married."
"威尔森夫人刚才不知什么时候又换了装束，现在身上是一件午后穿的那种精致的乳白色雪纺连衣裙。她在屋里走来走去时，裙子一直沙沙作响。也许是换了裙子的缘故，她整个人都变得不一样了。刚在修车厂里的那种引人注目的活力没了，取而代之的是极度的傲慢。她的笑声、她的姿态以及她的谈吐已经越来越装模作样。在她逐渐膨胀的同时，她周边的空间也变得越来越小了，直到最后，在烟雾弥漫的空气里，她好像在绕着一根叽叽喳喳的枢轴不停地旋转。","Mrs. Wilson had changed her costume some time before and was now attired in an elaborate afternoon dress of cream colored chiffon, which gave out a continual rustle as she swept about the room.With the influence of the dress her personality had also undergone a change.The intense vitality that had been so remarkable in the garage was converted into impressive hauteur.Her laughter, her gestures, her assertions became more violently affected moment by moment and as she expanded the room grew smaller around her until she seemed to be revolving on a noisy, creaking pivot through the smoky air."
"“亲爱的，”她有点装腔作势地向她妹妹大声说道，“现在的男人大多总会欺骗你。他们想的全是钱。我上周让一个女的给我看脚，最后一看她开的账单，我还以为她给我割了阑尾呢。”","‘My dear,’ she told her sister in a high mincing shout, ‘most of these fellas will cheat you every time.All they think of is money.I had a woman up here last week to look at my feet and when she gave me the bill you’d of thought she had my appendicitus out.’"
"“那女的叫什么？”麦基太太问道。","‘What was the name of the woman?’ asked Mrs. McKee."
"“埃伯哈特夫人。她经常到别人家中帮人家看脚。”“我很喜欢你的裙子，”麦基太太说，“看上去很可爱。”","‘Mrs. Eberhardt.She goes around looking at people’s feet in their own homes.’‘I like your dress,’ remarked Mrs. McKee, ‘I think it’s adorable.’"
"威尔森夫人很不屑地扬起眉头，对此恭维极不赞同。","Mrs. Wilson rejected the compliment by raising her eyebrow in disdain."
"“这件衣服都老掉牙了。”她说道，“我只是在自己不太在乎形象的时候才随便穿穿。”","‘It’s just a crazy old thing,’ she said.‘I just slip it on sometimes when I don’t care what I look like.’"
"“但是穿到你身上确实很好看，你要是懂我的意思的话。”麦基太太紧接着说道，“如果切斯特能将你现在的姿势抓拍下来的话，那一定是一幅杰作。”","‘But it looks wonderful on you, if you know what I mean,’ pursued Mrs. McKee.‘If Chester could only get you in that pose I think he could make something of it.’"
"我们都安静地看着威尔森夫人，只见她将眼前的一缕头发撩开，露出一脸灿烂的笑容看着我们。麦基先生专心致志地看着她，头侧向一边，手在脸前面来回慢慢地移动。","We all looked in silence at Mrs. Wilson who removed a strand of hair from over her eyes and looked back at us with a brilliant smile.Mr. McKee regarded her intently with his head on one side and then moved his hand back and forth slowly in front of his face."
"“我应该变换下光线。”过了一会儿，他说道，“我想制造出一种立体形象。我还想把后面的头发都拍摄进来。”","‘I should change the light,’ he said after a moment.‘I’d like to bring out the modelling of the features.And I’d try to get hold of all the back hair.’"
"“我认为不用变换光线。”麦基太太大声喊道，“我觉得……”","‘I wouldn’t think of changing the light,’ cried Mrs. McK-ee.‘I think it’s—’"
"他的丈夫“嘘”了一声，我们便将目光再次转移到拍摄题材上，只见汤姆·布坎南出声打了个呵欠便站起来了。","Her husband said ‘SH!’ and we all looked at the subject again whereupon Tom Buchanan yawned audibly and got to his feet."
"“麦基先生，麦基太太，你们喝点东西。”他说，“再拿点冰块和矿泉水，默特尔，要不大家都快睡着了。”","‘You McKees have something to drink,’ he said.‘Get some more ice and mineral water, Myrtle, before everybody goes to sleep.’"
"“我早就叫那小伙买冰了。”默特尔皱着眉头，对下人的慵懒显得有点绝望，“这些人啊！你得时刻跟着他们。”","‘I told that boy about the ice.’Myrtle raised her eyebrows in despair at the shiftlessness of the lower orders.‘These people!You have to keep after them all the time.’"
"她看着我莫名其妙地笑了起来。接着她活蹦乱跳地跑到狗跟前，欣喜若狂地亲了半天，随后又拽着裙摆摇摇晃晃走进了厨房，似乎里面有十几个厨师在等候她点菜一般。","She looked at me and laughed pointlessly.Then she flounced over to the dog, kissed it with ecstasy and swept into the kitchen, implying that a dozen chefs awaited her orders there."
"“我在长岛拍了几张很棒的照片。”麦基先生肯定地说。","‘I’ve done some nice things out on Long Island,’ asserted Mr. McKee."
"汤姆毫无表情地看着他。","Tom looked at him blankly."
"“其中两张就加了框挂在楼下。”","‘Two of them we have framed downstairs.’"
"“两张什么？”汤姆问道。","‘Two what?’ demanded Tom."
"“两张习作。其中一张叫做《蒙涛角——海鸥》，另外一张叫《蒙涛角——大海》。”妹妹凯瑟琳挨着我坐在了沙发上。“你也住在长岛吗？”她问道。“我住在西卵。”","‘Two studies.One of them I call ‘Montauk Point—the Gulls,’ and the other I call ‘Montauk Point—the Sea.’ The sister Catherine sat down beside me on the couch.‘Do you live down on Long Island, too?’ she inquired.‘I live at West Egg.’"
"“真的吗？大约一个月前我还去那儿参加过一个聚会。在一个姓盖茨比的人家里。你认识他吗？”“我就住他隔壁。”","‘Really?I was down there at a party about a month ago.At a man named Gatsby’s.Do you know him?’‘I live next door to him.’"
"“哦，他们说他是凯泽·威廉的外甥，或者是侄儿。他的钱就是从那儿来的。”","‘Well, they say he’s a nephew or a cousin of Kaiser Wil-helm’s.That’s where all his money comes from.’"
"“是吗？”","‘Really?’"
"她点点头：","She nodded."
"“我很怕他。我讨厌他占我便宜。”","‘I’m scared of him.I’d hate to have him get anything on me.’"
"突然麦基太太用手指着凯瑟琳，打断了这段关于我的邻居的趣闻。","This absorbing information about my neighbor was interrupted by Mrs. McKee’s pointing suddenly at Catherine:"
"“切斯特，我觉得你可以给她拍几张。”她大声嚷嚷着，但是麦基先生毫无兴趣地点点头，就将注意力放到了汤姆的身上：","‘Chester, I think you could do something with HER,’ she broke out, but Mr. McKee only nodded in a bored way and turned his attention to Tom."
"“要是有人引荐的话，我倒很想在长岛多干点业务。只要他们让我在那里开个头就好了。”“问默特尔啊。”汤姆边说边大声笑起来，威尔森夫人也正好端着托盘走了出来。“她可以帮你写介绍信，是不是，默特尔？”","‘I’d like to do more work on Long Island if I could get the entry.All I ask is that they should give me a start.’‘Ask Myrtle,’ said Tom, breaking into a short shout of laughter as Mrs. Wilson entered with a tray.‘She’ll give you a letter of introduction, won’t you, Myrtle?’"
"“干什么？”她惊讶地问道。","‘Do what?’ she asked, startled."
"“你可以帮麦基写封介绍信，把他介绍给你丈夫，这样他就可以给他拍些照片了。”他的嘴唇默默地动了几下便瞎编乱造说道，“《油泵前的乔治·B.威尔森》，或类似的东西。”","‘You’ll give McKee a letter of introduction to your husband, so he can do some studies of him.’His lips moved silently for a moment as he invented.‘ ‘George B. Wilson at the Gasoline Pump,’ or something like that.’"
"凯瑟琳凑向前，在我耳朵边轻声说：“他们俩都无法忍受自己的另一半。”","Catherine leaned close to me and whispered in my ear: ‘Neither of them can stand the person they’re married to.’"
"“他们不能忍受吗？”","‘Can’t they?’"
"“当然无法忍受。”她先看了看默特尔，又看了看汤姆，“要我说，他们既然忍受不了，还何苦要在一起继续过下去呢？我要是他们，就干脆离婚，然后两个人立马结婚。”","‘Can’t STAND them.’She looked at Myrtle and then at Tom.‘What I say is, why go on living with them if they can’t stand them?If I was them I’d get a divorce and get married to each other right away.’"
"“难道她也不喜欢威尔森吗？”","‘Doesn’t she like Wilson either?’"
"问题的回答真是出乎意料。是默特尔回答的，她刚好听到了我的问题，而且口气既粗暴又令人讨厌。","The answer to this was unexpected.It came from Myrtle who had overheard the question and it was violent and obscene."
"“你明白了？”凯瑟琳得意洋洋地喊了一句，她又将声音压低，“都是他老婆，弄得他俩连婚都没法结。她是一个天主教徒，他们信教的都不能接受离婚。”","‘You see?’ cried Catherine triumphantly.She lowered her voice again.‘It’s really his wife that’s keeping them apart.She’s a Catholic and they don’t believe in divorce.’"
"黛西并不是一个天主教徒，对于这个精心编造的谎言我感到有点震惊。","Daisy was not a Catholic and I was a little shocked at the elaborateness of the lie."
"“他们要是真的结婚了，”凯瑟琳继续说道，“他们准备先去西部住一段时间，等事情平息了再回来。”","‘When they do get married,’ continued Catherine, ‘they’re going west to live for a while until it blows over.’"
"“到欧洲去会更稳妥一些。”","‘It’d be more discreet to go to Europe.’"
"“噢，你喜欢欧洲吗？”她出人意料地大声喊道，“我刚从蒙特卡洛回来。”“是吗？”","‘Oh, do you like Europe?’ she exclaimed surprisingly.‘I just got back from Monte Carlo.’‘Really.’"
"“就是去年。我和另外一个女孩一起去的。”“呆了很久吗？”","‘Just last year.I went over there with another girl.’‘Stay long?’"
"“没有，我们只去了蒙特卡洛，然后就回来了。我们是从马赛那边过去的。我们出发的时候带了一千二百多美元，可是在赌场的私人单间两天就被人敲诈完了。告诉你吧，我们回来的时候吃尽了苦头。天哪，我真是太痛恨那个城市了！”","‘No, we just went to Monte Carlo and back.We went by way of Marseilles.We had over twelve hundred dollars when we started but we got gypped out of it all in two days in the private rooms.We had an awful time getting back, I can tell you.God, how I hated that town!’"
"那天下午，窗外的天空格外清爽，仿佛蔚蓝的地中海一般——接着，麦基太太的尖吼声将我的注意力吸引到屋内。","The late afternoon sky bloomed in the window for a moment like the blue honey of the Mediterranean—then the shrill voice of Mrs. McKee called me back into the room."
"“我也差点犯了个错误。”她精力充沛地大声讲道，“我差点嫁给一个曾经追求我多年的犹太小子。我知道他配不上自己。大家都对我说：‘露西尔，那小子根本配不上你！’但是如果我没有遇到切斯特，那家伙肯定就得逞了。”","‘I almost made a mistake, too,’ she declared vigorously.‘I almost married a little kyke who’d been after me for years.I knew he was below me.Everybody kept saying to me: ‘Lucille, that man’s way below you!’But if I hadn’t met Chester, he’d of got me sure.’"
"“是的，但你听我说，”默特尔·威尔森一边点着头一边说道，“至少你当时并没嫁给他啊。”","‘Yes, but listen,’ said Myrtle Wilson, nodding her head up and down, ‘at least you didn’t marry him.’"
"“我明白好在我没嫁给他。”","‘I know I didn’t.’"
"“可是，我嫁给了那个男人。”默特尔含含糊糊地说道，“那也正是你我两人情况的不同之处啊。”","‘Well, I married him,’ said Myrtle, ambiguously.‘And that’s the difference between your case and mine.’"
"“你当时为什么要嫁给他呢，默特尔？”凯瑟琳追问道，“也没人逼你嫁啊？”","‘Why did you, Myrtle?’ demanded Catherine.‘Nobody forced you to.’"
"默特尔想了一下。","Myrtle considered."
"“我嫁她是因为当时觉得他还是个绅士。”她最后说道，“我当时觉得他还算懂教养，谁知他连舔我的鞋都配不上。”","‘I married him because I thought he was a gentleman,’ she said finally.‘I thought he knew something about breeding, but he wasn’t fit to lick my shoe.’"
"“你有段时间还是挺迷恋他的嘛。”凯瑟琳说。","‘You were crazy about him for a while,’ said Catherine."
"“迷恋他！”默特尔用怀疑的语气喊道，“谁说我迷恋他了？我迷恋哪个男人也不会迷恋他。”","‘Crazy about him!’ cried Myrtle incredulously.‘Who said I was crazy about him?I never was any more crazy about him than I was about that man there.’"
"她突然指向我，接着大家都用一种责怪的目光看着我。我努力地作出一副与她的过去毫不相干的样子。","She pointed suddenly at me, and every one looked at me accusingly.I tried to show by my expression that I had played no part in her past."
"“唯一让我发疯的事情就是当我嫁给他的那一刻，我立即意识到自己犯了个错误。结婚的时候他穿着问别人借的高档西装，却从来没有向我提起过。后来有一天他出去了，人家就来要衣服。”她向四周张望了一下，看看谁在听，""‘哦，那是你的西服吗？’我说，‘这可是我第一次听说。’但我还是还给了他，然后我就躺倒床上放声大哭，一直哭了一下午。”","‘The only CRAZY I was was when I married him.I knew right away I made a mistake.He borrowed somebody’s best suit to get married in and never even told me about it, and the man came after it one day when he was out.’She looked around to see who was listening: ‘ ‘Oh, is that your suit?’I said.‘This is the first I ever heard about it.’But I gave it to him and then I lay down and cried to beat the band all afternoon.’"
"“她确实应该离开他。”凯瑟琳又开始跟我讲道，“他们在那个修车厂上面一直住了十一年。而且汤姆还是她的第一个恋人。”","‘She really ought to get away from him,’ resumed Catherine to me.‘They’ve been living over that garage for eleven years.And Tom’s the first sweetie she ever had.’"
"那瓶威士忌酒——第二瓶——现在被大家不停地倒到杯子里，只有凯瑟琳不喝，因为她“什么都不喝也已经很舒服了。”汤姆给门房打电话，让他去买一种很有名的三明治，说是吃了可以抵一顿晚饭。我想出去在柔和的暮光中向东朝公园那边走走，可是每次试图走时，那些不着边际的高谈阔论就会将我死死缠住，而且仿佛绳子一般将我拽回到椅子上。然而，我们这排黄色的窗户在城市的上空，一定在为黑黢黢的街道上某位悠闲的路人展示着人生的秘密。而我同他一样，仰头观望，充满了好奇与疑惑。我身处其中同时又置身事外，这些无穷无尽的人生百态让我沉醉其中，却又使我讨厌至极。","The bottle of whiskey—a second one—was now in constant demand by all present, excepting Catherine who ‘felt just as good on nothing at all.’Tom rang for the janitor and sent him for some celebrated sandwiches, which were a complete supper in themselves.I wanted to get out and walk eastward toward the park through the soft twilight but each time I tried to go I became entangled in some wild strident argument which pulled me back, as if with ropes, into my chair.Yet high over the city our line of yellow windows must have contributed their share of human secrecy to the casual watcher in the darkening streets, and I was him too, looking up and wondering.I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life."
"默特尔将她的椅子拉到我跟前，突然吐着热气向我讲起他和汤姆初次见面时候的事来：","Myrtle pulled her chair close to mine, and suddenly her warm breath poured over me the story of her first meeting with Tom."
"“那是两个相对而坐的座位，两个火车上总是最后剩下了的座位。我正要去纽约看望妹妹，并在那里过夜。他穿着一套西装，一双醒目的皮鞋，我总是忍不住想看他，而每次他看我的时候，我就只好假装在看他头上的广告。我们来到车站的时候，他就在我旁边，他那白色的衬衫前胸就贴在我的胳膊上——于是我对他说我要喊警察啦，不过他也知道我在骗他呢。我是如此激动，跟着他一起坐上出租车的那一刻，我竟然忘了自己是要坐地铁的。有一句话在我的脑子里一直重复着——‘你不可能永远活着，你不可能永远活着。’”","‘It was on the two little seats facing each other that are always the last ones left on the train.I was going up to New York to see my sister and spend the night.He had on a dress suit and patent leather shoes and I couldn’t keep my eyes off him but every time he looked at me I had to pretend to be looking at the advertisement over his head.When we came into the station he was next to me and his white shirt-front pressed against my arm—and so I told him I’d have to call a policeman, but he knew I lied.I was so excited that when I got into a taxi with him I didn’t hardly know I wasn’t getting into a subway train.All I kept thinking about, over and over, was ‘You can’t live forever, you can’t live forever.’"
"她转向了麦基太太，整个屋里回荡着她那做作的笑声。","She turned to Mrs. McKee and the room rang full of her artificial laughter."
"“亲爱的，”她大声说道，“我穿过后就把这件衣服送给你了。明天我再去买一件。我要把所有事情列个清单出来。按摩、烫发、给小狗买项圈、买一个小巧可爱的弹簧按钮烟灰缸，还要买一个装饰有黑丝带的花圈放到妈妈的坟前，那种可以一直放一个夏天。我要把这些在清单上写下来，这样我就不会漏掉什么事情。”","‘My dear,’ she cried, ‘I’m going to give you this dress as soon as I’m through with it.I’ve got to get another one tomorrow.I’m going to make a list of all the things I’ve got to get.A massage and a wave and a collar for the dog and one of those cute little ash-trays where you touch a spring, and a wreath with a black silk bow for mother’s grave that’ll last all summer.I got to write down a list so I won’t forget all the things I got to do.’"
"已经是九点了——转眼再一看表，发现都十点了。麦基先生在椅子上已经睡着了，他紧握的双拳放在大腿上，看上去活像一张行为艺术照。我拿出手绢将他脸颊上那块已经干了的皂沫擦掉，这块皂沫整个下午都烦扰着我。","It was nine o’clock—almost immediately afterward I looked at my watch and found it was ten.Mr. McKee was asleep on a chair with his fists clenched in his lap, like a photograph of a man of action.Taking out my handkerchief I wiped from his cheek the remains of the spot of dried lather that had worried me all the afternoon."
"小狗坐在桌上，用它那双隐蔽的眼睛透过缭绕的烟雾东张西望，时不时还发出几声轻轻的嗷叫。这些人们时而不见了，时而又重现了。他们计划出游，接着又丢掉了彼此，四处寻找对方却在几步之遥又发现了彼此。快到午夜时分了，汤姆·布坎南和威尔森夫人面对面站在那里，他们声音有些激动地争吵着威尔森夫人是否有权提及黛西的名字。","The little dog was sitting on the table looking with blind eyes through the smoke and from time to time groaning faintly.People disappeared, reappeared, made plans to go somewhere, and then lost each other, searched for each other, found each other a few feet away.Some time toward midnight Tom Buchanan and Mrs. Wilson stood face to face discussing in impassioned voices whether Mrs. Wilson had any right to mention Daisy’s name."
"“黛西！黛西！黛西！”威尔森夫人大声喊着，“我什么时候想叫什么时候叫！黛西！黛……”","‘Daisy!Daisy!Daisy!’ shouted Mrs. Wilson.‘I’ll say it whenever I want to!Daisy!Dai—’"
"汤姆迅速伸出他那双大手，一巴掌便将威尔森夫人的鼻子打破了。","Making a short deft movement Tom Buchanan broke her nose with his open hand."
"接着在浴室的地上便出现了一条带血的毛巾，还有女人的责骂声，以及混乱中因疼痛引发的嚎啕大哭声。麦基先生从昏睡中醒来，恍恍惚惚地朝门口走去。他走到一半便转过身来，目不转睛地盯着眼前的场景——她的妻子和凯瑟琳拿着急救用具在拥挤的家具间跌撞着跑来跑去，她们一边责怪一边安慰，而沙发上的那个近乎绝望的人一面不停地流着血，一面努力将一份《纽约闲话》摊开铺在那副凡尔赛宫的织锦套上。接着麦基先生转身过去，继续走出门外。我从吊灯架上取下帽子便跟着出去了。","Then there were bloody towels upon the bathroom floor, and women’s voices scolding, and high over the confusion a long broken wail of pain.Mr. McKee awoke from his doze and started in a daze toward the door.When he had gone half way he turned around and stared at the scene—his wife and Catherine scolding and consoling as they stumbled here and there among the crowded furniture with articles of aid, and the despairing figure on the couch bleeding fluently and trying to spread a copy of ‘Town Tattle’ over the tapestry scenes of Versailles.Then Mr. McKee turned and continued on out the door.Taking my hat from the chandelier I followed."
"“改天来一块吃午饭吧。”电梯吱吱呀呀地向下行时，他建议说道。“在哪儿？”“哪儿都行。”","‘Come to lunch some day,’ he suggested, as we groaned down in the elevator.‘Where?’‘Anywhere.’"
"“不要碰操作杆。”电梯工厉声说道。","‘Keep your hands off the lever,’ snapped the elevator boy."
"“不好意思，”麦基先生不失尊严地说，“我没注意自己碰到了。”","‘I beg your pardon,’ said Mr. McKee with dignity, ‘I didn’t know I was touching it.’"
"“好的，”我答应说，“改天一定来。”","‘All right,’ I agreed, ‘I’ll be glad to.’"
"……我站在他的床边，他坐在两张床单中间，仅穿着内衣，手里拿着一堆摄影资料。","... I was standing beside his bed and he was sitting up between the sheets, clad in his underwear, with a great portfolio in his hands."
"“《美女与野兽》……《寂寞》……《小店老马》……《布鲁克林大桥》……”","‘Beauty and the Beast... Loneliness... Old Grocery Horse... Brook’n Bridge"
"之后，我半睡半醒地躺在宾夕法尼亚车站那冷冰冰的底层，盯着一份当日清晨的《论坛报》，等着四点钟的火车。","Then I was lying half asleep in the cold lower level of the Pennsylvania Station, staring at the morning ‘Tribune’ and waiting for the four o’clock train."
"第三章","Chapter 3"
"整整一个夏天，每晚都能听到从邻居家里传出的音乐声。他那蓝色的花园里，男男女女如同飞蛾一般来回于轻声谈笑中，来回于香槟和繁星中。下午涨潮时候，我望着他的客人们从木排的跳台上跳水，望着他们在热乎乎的私人沙滩上晒太阳，而他的两艘汽艇则乘风破浪，拖着滑水板在泛起浪花的激流中前行。每到周末，他那辆劳斯莱斯就成了公共汽车，从早上九点一直到午夜过后，载着宴会的客人往返于城里，同时他的旅行车也如同一只轻快的黄色小虫一样奔赴火车站迎接所有车次的客人。而每逢周一，他的八个佣人，包括一个临时园丁，就开始了整整一天的辛苦劳作。他们拿着拖把、硬毛刷、锤子以及园艺剪刀，打理前夜留下的残局。","There was music from my neighbor’s house through the summer nights.In his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars.At high tide in the afternoon I watched his guests diving from the tower of his raft or taking the sun on the hot sand of his beach while his two motor-boats slit the waters of the Sound, drawing aquaplanes over cataracts of foam.On week-ends his Rolls-Royce became an omnibus, bearing parties to and from the city, between nine in the morning and long past midnight, while his station wagon scampered like a brisk yellow bug to meet all trains.And on Mondays eight servants including an extra gardener toiled all day with mops and scrubbing-brushes and hammers and garden-shears, repairing the ravages of the night before."
"每逢周五就会有五板条箱的橘子和柠檬从纽约的水果商那儿被运回来——而周一的时候，这些橘子和柠檬就会一分为二，变成一座座金字塔状的果皮堆，从后门运走。他的厨房里放着一台榨汁机，如果男管家不停地用大拇指按两百下小按钮，榨汁机就能在半小时之内将两百个橘子榨成果汁。","Every Friday five crates of oranges and lemons arrived from a fruiterer in New York—every Monday these same oranges and lemons left his back door in a pyramid of pulp-less halves.There was a machine in the kitchen which could extract the juice of two hundred oranges in half an hour, if a little button was pressed two hundred times by a butler’s thumb."
"每隔两周，一伙宴会筹备工作人员就会一次或多次带着几百英尺长的帆布和一大堆彩灯从城里过来，这些彩灯足够将盖茨比巨大的私人花园装饰成一棵圣诞树。自助餐桌上摆放着各式各样的开胃食品，一根根五香烤制火腿与五颜六色的色拉堆挤在一起，还有烤成深黄色的乳猪和火鸡。在大厅里设有一个用真铜制的扶手围起来的酒吧间，里面储备有松子酒、烈性酒和早被人遗忘的甘露酒。大多数女客人都太年轻了，根本分不清这些酒。","At least once a fortnight a corps of caterers came down with several hundred feet of canvas and enough colored lights to make a Christmas tree of Gatsby’s enormous garden.On buffet tables, garnished with glistening hors-d’oeuvre, spiced baked hams crowded against salads of harlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a dark gold.In the main hall a bar with a real brass rail was set up, and stocked with gins and liquors and with cordials so long forgotten that most of his female guests were too young to know one from another."
"到七点的时候，管弦乐队已经到了——这绝非是那种单薄的五人乐队，而是一个浩浩荡荡的大型交响乐团，他们装备有双簧管、长号、萨克斯、古提琴、短号、短笛和高低音铜鼓。最后一批游泳的客人已经从海滩上回来了，正在楼上换衣服。纽约开来的汽车在车道上排成长长的五列，大厅中、客厅里、阳台上满是艳丽的红、黄、蓝色，还有新潮怪异的发型以及卡斯蒂尔人做梦都想不到的披肩。酒吧间开始热闹起来，觥筹交错中鸡尾酒飘洒于整个花园，空气里到处是欢声笑语，有随随便便的调侃，有当场就被遗忘的介绍，还有素不相识的女人之间热情的相会。","By seven o’clock the orchestra has arrived—no thin five-piece affair but a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and saxophones and viols and cornets and piccolos and low and high drums.The last swimmers have come in from the beach now and are dressing upstairs; the cars from New York are parked five deep in the drive, and already the halls and salons and verandas are gaudy with primary colors and hair shorn in strange new ways and shawls beyond the dreams of Castile.The bar is in full swing and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the garden outside until the air is alive with chatter and laughter and casual innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot and enthusiastic meetings between women who never knew each other’s names."
"灯光更加明亮了，大地已经摇摇晃晃地将太阳甩掉，此刻管弦乐队正在演奏黄色鸡尾酒会乐，而如同歌剧表演般的谈笑声也提高了一个调。欢笑声变得越来越轻松自在，而且被慷慨地洒落到角角落落，即便是一句逗乐的话也会带来满堂欢笑。人群越来越迅速地变换着，随着新到的客人而增大，不断离散重组着——这里已经有一些人四处闲逛，那些骄傲的女孩在密集稳固的人群中到处摇摆，时而欢呼雀跃地成了人群的焦点，接着又在不断变换的灯光下激动不已地穿梭于错综变化的面孔、声音和色彩之中。","The lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun and now the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music and the opera of voices pitches a key higher.Laughter is easier, minute by minute, spilled with prodigality, tipped out at a cheerful word.The groups change more swiftly, swell with new arrivals, dissolve and form in the same breath—already there are wanderers, confident girls who weave here and there among the stouter and more stable, become for a sharp, joyous moment the center of a group and then excited with triumph glide on through the sea-change of faces and voices and color under the constantly changing light."
"突然其中一位吉普赛女孩摇晃着满身的珠宝首饰，伸手抓住一杯才端过来的鸡尾酒，一口倒到肚子里给自己壮了壮胆，便在帆布台上挥手独舞。周围瞬间一片寂静，接着管弦乐队指挥非常热心地为她变换了演奏旋律，随后便爆发出一阵吵吵嚷嚷的闲聊声，散布着关于她的谣言，说她其实是速演剧团吉尔德·格雷的替角。晚会已经开始。","Suddenly one of these gypsies in trembling opal, seizes a cocktail out of the air, dumps it down for courage and moving her hands like Frisco dances out alone on the canvas platform.A momentary hush; the orchestra leader varies his rhythm obligingly for her and there is a burst of chatter as the erroneous news goes around that she is Gilda Gray’s understudy from the ‘Follies.’The party has begun."
"我相信那天晚上我第一次去盖茨比家的时候，我是几个为数不多的真正受邀的客人之一。人们并没被邀请——他们是自己来的。他们坐上一辆将他们载往长岛的汽车，最后不知何故便来到了盖茨比家门口。他们被认识盖茨比的人介绍过一次后，随后他们的行为准则就同游乐园里要求的一样了。有时他们来去都根本见不到盖茨比，怀着一颗简单的心来娱乐，这便是晚会的入场券。","I believe that on the first night I went to Gatsby’s house I was one of the few guests who had actually been invited.People were not invited—they went there.They got into automobiles which bore them out to Long Island and somehow they ended up at Gatsby’s door.Once there they were introduced by somebody who knew Gatsby and after that they conducted themselves according to the rules of behavior associated with amusement parks.Sometimes they came and went without having met Gatsby at all, came for the party with a simplicity of heart that was its own ticket of admission."
"我的确是受邀而来的。那是一个星期六的清晨，一个身着绿蓝色制服的司机穿过我的草坪，出乎意料地为我送来了一封来自他主人的正式邀请函，函文里问我是否愿意赏光参加当晚的“小聚会”。他说他曾几次见到过我，也曾有意上门拜访，但是由于各种原因未能如愿——下面是杰伊·盖茨比那威风的签名。","I had been actually invited.A chauffeur in a uniform of robin’s egg blue crossed my lawn early that Saturday morning with a surprisingly formal note from his employer—the honor would be entirely Gatsby’s, it said, if I would attend his ‘little party’ that night.He had seen me several times and had intended to call on me long before but a peculiar combination of circumstances had prevented it—signed Jay Gatsby in a majestic hand."
"晚上七点刚过，我就穿上自己的白色法兰绒套装来到他的草坪，在一群素不相识的人中间走来走去，感觉浑身不自在——虽然时不时会有我上班时在火车上见过的面孔。很快人群中夹杂的一些年轻的英国人吸引了我的注意，他们个个穿着讲究，殷勤无比而又低声下气地和那些健壮而富有的美国人谈论着什么。我确定他们在推销东西，可能是债券，或保险，或是汽车。他们至少还是痛苦地意识到，眼前就有唾手可得的钱，只要语出巧妙，几句话的功夫钱就是他们的了。","Dressed up in white flannels I went over to his lawn a little after seven and wandered around rather ill-at-ease among swirls and eddies of people I didn’t know—though here and there was a face I had noticed on the commuting train.I was immediately struck by the number of young Englishmen dotted about; all well dressed, all looking a little hungry and all talking in low earnest voices to solid and prosperous Americans.I was sure that they were selling something: bonds or insurance or automobiles.They were, at least, agonizingly aware of the easy money in the vicinity and convinced that it was theirs for a few words in the right key."
"我刚到就尝试着找主人，我问了两三个人主人在何处，他们却都大为吃惊地盯着我，然后一口咬定关于主人的所在他们一概不知，我也只好灰溜溜地朝鸡尾酒桌走去——那是花园里唯一一处可容一个单身男人逗留的地方，只有在这里才不会显得那么漫无目的和孤独。","As soon as I arrived I made an attempt to find my host but the two or three people of whom I asked his whereabouts stared at me in such an amazed way and denied so vehemently any knowledge of his movements that I slunk off in the direction of the cocktail table—the only place in the garden where a single man could linger without looking purposeless and alone."
"在这种尴尬困窘之中，我正想喝个酩酊大醉，却看见乔丹·贝克从房间里走出来。她站在大理石台阶上面，身体微微后仰，用一副不屑的表情俯视着下面的花园。","I was on my way to get roaring drunk from sheer embarrassment when Jordan Baker came out of the house and stood at the head of the marble steps, leaning a little backward and looking with contemptuous interest down into the garden."
"不管她是否愿意，我觉得自己是应该找一个人说说话了，否则过会儿就要找个过往的客人随便寒暄起来了。","Welcome or not, I found it necessary to attach myself to someone before I should begin to address cordial remarks to the passers-by."
"“你好！”我边大吼着边朝她走过去。在花园里听起来，我的声音似乎大得有点异常。","‘Hello!’I roared, advancing toward her.My voice seemed unnaturally loud across the garden."
"“我想你可能会来。”等我走近的时候，她心不在焉地回应我，“我记得你就住隔壁……”","‘I thought you might be here,’ she responded absently as I came up.‘I remembered you lived next door to—’"
"她不掺杂丝毫感情地握起我的手，以此向我保证马上就招呼我，然后侧耳去听台阶下的两个身着同样黄色裙子的女孩说话。","She held my hand impersonally, as a promise that she’d take care of me in a minute, and gave ear to two girls in twin yellow dresses who stopped at the foot of the steps."
"“你好！”他们齐声喊道，“真遗憾你没有赢。”","‘Hello!’ they cried together.‘Sorry you didn’t win.’"
"她们在说高尔夫比赛。她在上周决赛时输了。","That was for the golf tournament.She had lost in the finals the week before."
"“你不认识我们是谁，”穿黄色裙子其中一个女孩说道，“但我们大概一个月前就在这儿见过你。”","‘You don’t know who we are,’ said one of the girls in yellow, ‘but we met you here about a month ago.’"
"“之后你们就染了头发吧。”乔丹说道，我大吃一惊，而那两个女孩却随意地走开了。她的这句话似乎是讲给了那轮初月，月亮同晚餐一样，毫无疑问也是由宴会操办者布置的。我扶着乔丹那纤细的金黄色手臂，一起走下台阶，来到花园闲逛。暮色中有人端来了鸡尾酒，于是我们就同那两位身着黄裙的女孩还有三位男士一起坐在一张桌子旁，那三个男士自我介绍的时候咕哝了半天，也没听清楚是什么名字。","‘You’ve dyed your hair since then,’ remarked Jordan, and I started but the girls had moved casually on and her remark was addressed to the premature moon, produced like the supper, no doubt, out of a caterer’s basket.With Jordan’s slender golden arm resting in mine we descended the steps and sauntered about the garden.A tray of cocktails floated at us through the twilight and we sat down at a table with the two girls in yellow and three men, each one introduced to us as Mr. Mumble."
"“你经常来参加这儿的聚会吗？”乔丹问她旁边的女孩。","‘Do you come to these parties often?’ inquired Jordan of the girl beside her."
"“我上次来就是遇见你的那次。”那女孩活泼而自信地答道。她转向同伴问道：“你也是吧，露西尔？”","‘The last one was the one I met you at,’ answered the girl, in an alert, confident voice.She turned to her companion: ‘Wasn’t it for you, Lucille?’"
"露西尔同样也是。","It was for Lucille, too."
"“我很想来。”露西尔说，“我并不在乎要干些什么，所以每次都玩得很开心。上次来这儿的时候，我在椅子上将裙子给弄破了，他就问了我的姓名和住址——还不到一周，我就收到了克罗里公司送来的包裹，里面是一件崭新的晚礼服。”","‘I like to come,’ Lucille said.‘I never care what I do, so I always have a good time.When I was here last I tore my gown on a chair, and he asked me my name and address—inside of a week I got a package from Croirier’s with a new evening gown in it.’"
"“那你收下了吗？”乔丹问道。","‘Did you keep it?’ asked Jordan."
"“我当然收下了。我原本打算今晚要穿的，但是衣服胸口太大，要改一下才行。衣服是淡蓝色的，上面有淡紫色的小饰珠。265美元。”","‘Sure I did.I was going to wear it tonight, but it was too big in the bust and had to be altered.It was gas blue with lavender beads.Two hundred and sixty-five dollars.’"
"“有人干这种事，那还是挺有意思的。”另外一个女孩热切地说。“他不想与任何一个人闹得不愉快。”","‘There’s something funny about a fellow that’ll do a thing like that,’ said the other girl eagerly.‘He doesn’t want any trouble with ANYbody.’"
"“谁不想？”我问道。","‘Who doesn’t?’I inquired."
"“盖茨比。有人对我说……”","‘Gatsby.Somebody told me—’"
"那两个女孩和乔丹神秘地将身子向前靠到一起。","The two girls and Jordan leaned together confidentially."
"“有人对我说他们觉得他杀过一个人。”","‘Somebody told me they thought he killed a man once.’"
"我们几个顿感诧异。那三位男士也侧身过来，急切地想听说话内容。","A thrill passed over all of us.The three Mr. Mumbles bent forward and listened eagerly."
"“我才不相信那些话呢。”露西尔用怀疑的口气说道，“他更有可能是战争时期德国的间谍。”","‘I don’t think it’s so much THAT,’ argued Lucille skeptically; ‘it’s more that he was a German spy during the war.’"
"其中一位男士也很肯定地点点头。","One of the men nodded in confirmation."
"“我也听一个非常了解他的男的说过，那男的和他一块在德国长大。”他非常肯定地对我们说。","‘I heard that from a man who knew all about him, grew up with him in Germany,’ he assured us positively."
"“哦，不是的，”第一个女孩说道，“不可能是那样的，因为战争期间他是在美国部队。”由于我们又相信她的话了，她便兴趣大发地将身子探过来，“你们在他没有发现的时候可以观察一下他。我确定他杀过一个人。”","‘Oh, no,’ said the first girl, ‘it couldn’t be that, because he was in the American army during the war.’As our credulity switched back to her she leaned forward with enthusiasm.‘You look at him sometimes when he thinks nobody’s looking at him.I’ll bet he killed a man.’"
"她眯起眼睛打了个冷颤。露西尔也打了个冷战。我们都转过身，环顾四周寻找盖茨比。有些人早就认为这世界上没有什么需要窃窃私语的事情，现在谈起他来却这样避讳，这一点也足以证明他引起了人们何等浪漫的遐想了。","She narrowed her eyes and shivered.Lucille shivered.We all turned and looked around for Gatsby.It was testimony to the romantic speculation he inspired that there were whispers about him from those who found little that it was necessary to whisper about in this world."
"第一顿晚饭——午夜之后将会又有一顿——现在已经开餐，乔丹邀请我同她的一伙熟人坐到一起，他们都在花园的另一侧，围着一张桌子坐着。其中有三对夫妇，另有一位陪同乔丹来的男大学生。他言语谈吐蛮横无理，含沙射影地表示早晚乔丹都会或多或少委身于他。宴会上人们并不会四处走动，他们都正襟危坐，完全将自己当作是沉着的乡村贵族代表——从东卵屈尊光顾西卵，谨慎提防着任何灯红酒绿中的寻欢作乐。","The first supper—there would be another one after midnight—was now being served, and Jordan invited me to join her own party who were spread around a table on the other side of the garden.There were three married couples and Jordan’s escort, a persistent undergraduate given to violent innuendo and obviously under the impression that sooner or later Jordan was going to yield him up her person to a greater or lesser degree.Instead of rambling this party had preserved a dignified homogeneity, and assumed to itself the function of representing the staid nobility of the countryside—East Egg condescending to West Egg, and carefully on guard against its spectroscopic gayety."
"“我们出去吧。”坐在那种极其不和谐的气氛中浪费了半个小时后，她轻声对我说，“这些人太文雅了，我接受不了。”","‘Let’s get out,’ whispered Jordan, after a somehow wasteful and inappropriate half hour.‘This is much too polite for me.’"
"我们俩站起来，她跟大家解释说我们要去找主人——她说她从来没见过他，这让我颇感拘束不安。那位大学生点了点头，脸上露出一副不屑却又忧郁的表情。","We got up, and she explained that we were going to find the host—I had never met him, she said, and it was making me uneasy.The undergraduate nodded in a cynical, melancholy way."
"我们先瞅了一眼拥挤的酒吧，盖茨比不在那儿。她站在台阶上四处看了一下，也没找到他，而且他也不在阳台上。我们试着推开一扇庄严的大门，走进一个高大的哥特式图书馆，馆内镶嵌着英国的雕花橡木，橡木很可能是从海外遗址完整运输回来的。","The bar, where we glanced first, was crowded but Gatsby was not there.She couldn’t find him from the top of the steps, and he wasn’t on the veranda.On a chance we tried an important-looking door, and walked into a high Gothic library, panelled with carved English oak, and probably transported complete from some ruin overseas."
"一个矮胖矮胖的中年男人，戴着一副巨大的猫头鹰式眼镜，微微有点醉，坐在一张大桌子边上，摇摇晃晃地盯着一排排书架上的书全神贯注地看着。我们进去后，他便激动地转过身来，从头到脚打量着乔丹。","A stout, middle-aged man with enormous owl-eyed spectacles was sitting somewhat drunk on the edge of a great table, staring with unsteady concentration at the shelves of books.As we entered he wheeled excitedly around and examined Jordan from head to foot."
"“你觉得怎么样？”他有些冒失地问道。","‘What do you think?’ he demanded impetuously."
"“什么怎么样？”","‘About what?’"
"他挥手指向一排排的书架，“那些。事实上你也没必要去查看了，我已经查看过了。它们是真实的。”“那些书吗？”他点了点头。","He waved his hand toward the book-shelves.‘About that.As a matter of fact you needn’t bother to ascertain.I ascertained.They’re real.’‘The books?’He nodded."
"“绝对是真的——有一页一页的纸，什么都有。我原本以为它们只是一些漂亮结实的书壳子。实际上，他们确实是真的。一页一页的——来这儿！我翻给你们看。”","‘Absolutely real—have pages and everything.I thought they’d be a nice durable cardboard.Matter of fact, they’re absolutely real.Pages and—Here!Lemme show you.’"
"他理所当然地觉得我们会怀疑他的话，于是便跑到书架前，取了一册《斯托达德演讲集》拿过来。","Taking our skepticism for granted, he rushed to the bookcases and returned with Volume One of the ‘Stoddard Lectures.’"
"“看！”他洋洋得意地大喊着，“这可是实实在在的印刷品啊。它把我愚弄了。这家伙就是个贝拉斯科。真是成功啊！多么细致！多么逼真！懂得适可而止——一页纸都没有拆开。你还想要什么呢？你还有什么期待呢？”","‘See!’ he cried triumphantly.‘It’s a bona fide piece of printed matter.It fooled me.This fella’s a regular Belasco.It’s a triumph.What thoroughness!What realism!Knew when to stop too—didn’t cut the pages.But what do you want?What do you expect?’"
"他又把书从我手里抢了回去，一边急急忙忙放回原来的书架上，一边嘴里嘀咕着若是动了其中的一块砖，整个图书馆就有可能会倒塌。","He snatched the book from me and replaced it hastily on its shelf muttering that if one brick was removed the whole library was liable to collapse."
"“谁带你们过来的？”他问道，“还是你们自己过来的？我可是别人带来的。大多数人都是别人带来的。”","‘Who brought you?’ he demanded.‘Or did you just come?I was brought.Most people were brought.’"
"乔丹很机警地看着他，看上去很开心的样子，却并没有答话。","Jordan looked at him alertly, cheerfully without answering."
"“我是一个姓罗斯福的女的带来的。”他继续说道，“克劳德·罗斯福太太。昨晚我在某个地方碰到她了。我已经醉了快一周了，我觉得呆在图书馆里或许会清醒一点。”","‘I was brought by a woman named Roosevelt,’ he continued.‘Mrs. Claud Roosevelt.Do you know her?I met her somewhere last night.I’ve been drunk for about a week now, and I thought it might sober me up to sit in a library.’"
"“清醒了吗？”","‘Has it?’"
"“清醒一点了吧，我觉得是。我也说不准。我来这儿才呆了一个小时。我和你们讲没讲这些书啊？他们都是真的。他们都是……”","‘A little bit, I think.I can’t tell yet.I’ve only been here an hour.Did I tell you about the books?They’re real.They’re—"
"“你和我们讲过了。”","‘You told us.’"
"我们非常严肃地同他握了握手，便转身走出门外。","We shook hands with him gravely and went back outdoors."
"此时，花园里的帆布上有人在跳舞，老头子拉着年轻女孩子笨拙地转着圈一直往后退，高傲的夫妇相互拥抱着，在一个角落里迈着时尚的舞步扭来扭去——而一帮单身女孩都在独舞，有时还混在乐队里，一会儿帮忙弹奏班卓琴，一会儿又敲打打击乐器。等到午夜时分，欢歌笑语声越来越高。一位著名的男高音演唱了意大利文歌，另一位声名狼藉的女低音又演唱了爵士，花园中人群中间还有人在表演绝技，时不时引得阵阵欢快而空洞的笑声，回荡在夏日的天空。一对双胞胎在台上——结果就是那两个穿黄裙的女孩——穿着表演服，演了一场娃娃戏，这时香槟端上来了，用比洗手碗大点的杯子盛着。月亮升得更高了，一架银色的三角天平漂浮在海面，伴着草坪上铿锵的班卓琴声颤动着。","There was dancing now on the canvas in the garden, old men pushing young girls backward in eternal graceless circles, superior couples holding each other tortuously, fashionably and keeping in the corners—and a great number of single girls dancing individualistically or relieving the orchestra for a moment of the burden of the banjo or the traps.By midnight the hilarity had increased.A celebrated tenor had sung in Italian and a notorious contralto had sung in jazz and between the numbers people were doing ‘stunts’ all over the garden, while happy vacuous bursts of laughter rose toward the summer sky.A pair of stage ‘twins’—who turned out to be the girls in yellow—did a baby act in costume and champagne was served in glasses bigger than finger bowls.The moon had risen higher, and floating in the Sound was a triangle of silver scales, trembling a little to the stiff, tinny drip of the banjoes on the lawn."
"我依然和乔丹·贝克呆在一起。我们在一张桌子旁坐下，同坐一张桌子的还有一个同我年龄差不多大的男士，还有一个非常吵闹的小姑娘，她动不动就狂笑不止。我现在玩得非常开心。我已喝了洗手碗大小的两杯香槟，眼前的景象变得有意义，变得原始和深奥。","I was still with Jordan Baker.We were sitting at a table with a man of about my age and a rowdy little girl who gave way upon the slightest provocation to uncontrollable laughter.I was enjoying myself now.I had taken two finger bowls of champagne and the scene had changed before my eyes into something significant, elemental and profound."
"娱乐活动中场休息的时候，一位男子看着我微笑。","At a lull in the entertainment the man looked at me and smiled."
"“您看起来很面熟。”他礼貌地说，“战争期间你是在第三师吗？”","‘Your face is familiar,’ he said, politely.‘Weren’t you in the Third Division during the war?’"
"“啊，是啊。我在第九炮机枪营。”","‘Why, yes.I was in the Ninth Machine-Gun Battalion.’"
"“我在第七步兵连一直呆到1918年６月。我就知道我在什么地方见过您。”","‘I was in the Seventh Infantry until June nineteen-eigh-teen.I knew I’d seen you somewhere before.’"
"我们聊了会儿法国那潮湿而灰暗的小村庄。显然他就住附近，因为他对我说自己刚买了架水上飞机，正准备明天早上试飞。","We talked for a moment about some wet, grey little villages in France.Evidently he lived in this vicinity for he told me that he had just bought a hydroplane and was going to try it out in the morning."
"“和我一块去吧，老兄？就在海岸附近沿着海峡。”","‘Want to go with me, old sport?Just near the shore along the Sound.’"
"“几点？”","‘What time?’"
"“你觉得几点合适就几点。”","‘Any time that suits you best.’"
"我正想问他的名字，可是话刚到嘴边，乔丹就朝四周看了看，笑了笑。","It was on the tip of my tongue to ask his name when Jordan looked around and smiled."
"“现在玩开心了吧？”她问道。","‘Having a gay time now?’ she inquired."
"“感觉好多了。”我再次转向这位新认识的朋友，“对我来说这个晚会真是不同寻常。我还没见过主人呢。我就住那边……”我扬手指向远处不怎么看得见的树篱，“这位盖茨比先生让他的司机给我送了一份请帖。”","‘Much better.’I turned again to my new acquaintance.‘This is an unusual party for me.I haven’t even seen the host.I live over there—’ I waved my hand at the invisible hedge in the distance, ‘and this man Gatsby sent over his chauffeur with an invitation.’"
"他似乎不太理解地看了我一会儿。","For a moment he looked at me as if he failed to understand."
"“我就是盖茨比。”他突然说道。","‘I’m Gatsby,’ he said suddenly."
"“什么！”我惊奇地叫道，“哦，你说什么？”“我还以为你知道呢，老兄。看来恐怕我不是个好主人。”","‘What!’I exclaimed.‘Oh, I beg your pardon.’‘I thought you knew, old sport.I’m afraid I’m not a very good host.’"
"他会意地笑了笑——完全领会了。这是一种非常特殊的笑，他的笑容让人永远都不会再疑虑，而且你一辈子也只可能看到四五次。它面对着——或是看上去似乎面对着——整个永恒的世界的一瞬间，便又带着一种无法抗拒的偏爱集聚到你身上。他以一种你期待着被理解的方式理解你，又似你相信自己那样相信你，而且让你放心地明白，你给他的印象真是你所希望给予别人的最好印象。就在此时，他的笑容消失了——我看着这位举止文雅的年轻男士，他只有三十一二，谈吐优雅，却又不显滑稽。他在做自我介绍之前，给我一种强烈的印象，就是我觉得他说话时要斟词酌句。","He smiled understandingly—much more than under-standingly.It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life.It faced—or seemed to face—the whole external world for an instant, and then concentrated on YOU with an irresistible prejudice in your favor.It understood you just so far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey.Precisely at that point it vanished—and I was looking at an elegant young rough-neck, a year or two over thirty, whose elaborate formality of speech just missed being absurd.Some time before he introduced himself I’d got a strong impression that he was picking his words with care."
"差不多就在盖茨比先生表明身份的时候，一个管家匆匆忙忙地跑到他身边，告诉他说芝加哥那边有人打电话找他。他对着我们微微鞠了个躬便告辞了。","Almost at the moment when Mr. Gatsby identified himself a butler hurried toward him with the information that Chicago was calling him on the wire.He excused himself with a small bow that included each of us in turn."
"“你需要什么就提出来，老兄。”他恳请我说，“请见谅。我过会儿再来找你。”","‘If you want anything just ask for it, old sport,’ he urged me.‘Excuse me.I will rejoin you later.’"
"他走了之后，我便立刻转向乔丹——非常不自然地向她表示我的惊讶。我一度猜想着盖茨比先生应该是一个红光满面、肥头大耳的中年男人。","When he was gone I turned immediately to Jordan—constrained to assure her of my surprise.I had expected that Mr. Gatsby would be a florid and corpulent person in his middle years."
"“他是谁？”我问道，“你知道吗？”","‘Who is he?’I demanded.‘Do you know?’"
"“他不就是一个叫盖茨比的人嘛。”“我是说他来自哪儿？还有他是干什么的？”","‘He’s just a man named Gatsby.’‘Where is he from, I mean?And what does he do?’"
"“现在你也开始关心这些问题啦。”她无精打采地笑着说，“嗯……他曾经对我说他是牛津毕业的。”","‘Now YOU’re started on the subject,’ she answered with a wan smile.‘Well,—he told me once he was an Oxford man.’"
"有关他的背景刚刚开始有点眉目，可等她说下句话的时候便又消失了。“但是我不相信。”“为什么不相信？”","A dim background started to take shape behind him but at her next remark it faded away.‘However, I don’t believe it.’‘Why not?’"
"“我不知道，”她坚持说道，“我只是觉得他不可能上过牛津。”","‘I don’t know,’ she insisted, ‘I just don’t think he went there.’"
"她的语气有点让我想起另外那个女孩说的“我觉得他杀过一个人。”结果还激发了我的好奇心。不管是说盖茨比来自于路易斯安那州的贫民区，还是说他出身于纽约东区下层，我都会毫无疑问地相信。那是可以理解的。但是年轻人不会——至少在我这个没经验的外地人看来，我相信他们是不会——莫名其妙地漂泊而来，然后在长岛海湾买上一座豪华别墅。","Something in her tone reminded me of the other girl’s ‘I think he killed a man,’ and had the effect of stimulating my curiosity.I would have accepted without question the information that Gatsby sprang from the swamps of Louisiana or from the lower East Side of New York.That was comprehensible.But young men didn’t—at least in my provincial inexperience I believed they didn’t—drift coolly out of nowhere and buy a palace on Long Island Sound."
"“无论如何，他经常举行大型宴会。”乔丹说道，转换了话题，非常优雅地拒绝了细节的谈论，“而且我喜欢大型宴会。人与人之间会显得如此地亲密。在小的聚会上大家根本不会谈论个人隐私。”","‘Anyhow he gives large parties,’ said Jordan, changing the subject with an urbane distaste for the concrete.‘And I like large parties.They’re so intimate.At small parties there isn’t any privacy.’"
"这时传来了大鼓的隆隆声，接着在人声嘈杂花园的上空突然响起乐队指挥的声音。","There was the boom of a bass drum, and the voice of the orchestra leader rang out suddenly above the echolalia of the garden."
"“女士们，先生们，”他大声喊道，“应盖茨比先生的要求，接下来我们为大家演奏一曲弗拉迪米尔·托斯托夫先生的最新曲目，这首曲子去年五月在卡内基大礼堂曾备受关注。如果您当时读了报纸，您一定知道此曲当时引起了多大的轰动。”他露出一脸快活而傲慢的微笑，接着又补充说道：“好大的轰动！”于是，大家都笑了起来。","‘Ladies and gentlemen,’ he cried.‘At the request of Mr. Gatsby we are going to play for you Mr. Vladimir Tostoff’s latest work which attracted so much attention at Carnegie Hall last May. If you read the papers you know there was a big sensation.’He smiled with jovial condescension and added ‘Some sensation!’ whereupon everybody laughed."
"“这首曲子，”他最后兴致勃勃地说，“被誉为《弗拉迪米尔·托斯托夫的爵士音乐世界史》。”","‘The piece is known,’ he concluded lustily, ‘as ‘Vladimir Tostoff’s Jazz History of the World.’"
"我并没有仔细聆听托斯托夫先生的作品，因为演奏刚开始，我的目光就转移到了盖茨比身上，只见他一个人站在大理石台阶上，用一种心满意足的目光环顾着下面的一群群客人。他那棕色的皮肤紧绷在迷人的脸上，而他的短发看起来似乎是天天都要修剪一般。在他的身上我看不出有半点邪恶。我在想是否正是由于他从不喝酒，才得以在这些客人中显得如此与众不同，因为我觉得在那种称兄道弟的热闹狂欢中，他似乎显得更加举止得当。等《爵士音乐世界史》演奏完毕，有些女孩子小鸟依人般开心地将头靠到男人的肩膀上，有些女孩半开玩笑地故意晕倒在男人的怀中，甚至有些还倒向人群，好像知道肯定有人会接着她们——但是没有一个人会倒在盖茨比的身上，没有哪个法国短发女人会去触碰一下盖茨比的肩膀，也没有哪组四重唱会去找盖茨比来围一个圈。","The nature of Mr. Tostoff’s composition eluded me, because just as it began my eyes fell on Gatsby, standing alone on the marble steps and looking from one group to another with approving eyes.His tanned skin was drawn attractively tight on his face and his short hair looked as though it were trimmed every day.I could see nothing sinister about him.I wondered if the fact that he was not drinking helped to set him off from his guests, for it seemed to me that he grew more correct as the fraternal hilarity increased.When the ‘Jazz History of the World’ was over girls were putting their heads on men’s shoulders in a puppyish, convivial way, girls were swooning backward playfully into men’s arms, even into groups knowing that some one would arrest their falls—but no one swooned backward on Gatsby and no French bob touched Gatsby’s shoulder and no singing quartets were formed with Gatsby’s head for one link."
"“不好意思。”","‘I beg your pardon.’"
"盖茨比的管家突然站在我们的旁边。“贝克小姐吗？”他问道，“不好意思，盖茨比先生想和您单独说话。”“和我？”她大声惊叫道。“是的，小姐。”","Gatsby’s butler was suddenly standing beside us.‘Miss Baker?’ he inquired.‘I beg your pardon but Mr. Gatsby would like to speak to you alone.’‘With me?’ she exclaimed in surprise.‘Yes, madame.’"
"她缓慢地站起来，朝着我一脸诧异地扬起双眉，接着便跟着管家向房子走去。我注意到她穿的是晚礼服，她所有的晚礼服都和运动服有点像——她迈着轻快活泼的步子走着，就像在清新舒适的早晨，她刚学会在高尔夫球场走路一般。","She got up slowly, raising her eyebrows at me in astonishment, and followed the butler toward the house.I noticed that she wore her evening dress, all her dresses, like sports clothes—there was a jauntiness about her movements as if she had first learned to walk upon golf courses on clean, crisp mornings."
"我独自一人，已经快到两点了。又过了好一会儿功夫，从阳台上面那间装有一长排窗户的房间里传出一阵阵杂乱而引人入胜的声音。陪同乔丹来的那个男大学生现在正同合唱队里的两个女孩聊着产科问题，他还恳求我加入他们的讨论，为了避开他，我进到房里去了。","I was alone and it was almost two.For some time confused and intriguing sounds had issued from a long many-windowed room which overhung the terrace.Eluding Jordan’s undergraduate who was now engaged in an obstetrical conversation with two chorus girls, and who implored me to join him, I went inside."
"这个大大的房间里挤满了人。穿黄衣裙女孩的其中一个正在弹钢琴，站在她身边伴唱的是一位身材高挑、满头红发的年轻少妇，她来自一个非常出名的合唱团。她喝了不少的香槟，在唱歌的时候，她非常可笑地认定所有一切都是如此地悲哀——她不仅在唱歌，同时还在哭泣。歌曲里边只要一有停顿，她便不停地哽咽抽泣，然后又颤颤巍巍地接着歌词继续用女高音往下唱。眼泪顺着她的脸颊流了下来——但并不是直接流下来的，因为每当眼泪流到她那满是泪珠的睫毛上，便被染成了墨色，然后变成黑色的小溪继续慢慢流下来。有人非常幽默地建议她唱一下脸上的那些音符，她听后便甩手倒到椅子上，醉醺醺地沉睡过去了。","The large room was full of people.One of the girls in yellow was playing the piano and beside her stood a tall, red haired young lady from a famous chorus, engaged in song.She had drunk a quantity of champagne and during the course of her song she had decided ineptly that everything was very very sad—she was not only singing, she was weeping too.Whenever there was a pause in the song she filled it with gasping broken sobs and then took up the lyric again in a quavering soprano.The tears coursed down her cheeks—not freely, however, for when they came into contact with her heavily beaded eyelashes they assumed an inky color, and pursued the rest of their way in slow black rivulets.A humorous suggestion was made that she sing the notes on her face whereupon she threw up her hands, sank into a chair and went off into a deep vinous sleep."
"“她刚同一个男的吵了一架，那男的说自己是她丈夫。”我旁边的女孩解释说道。","‘She had a fight with a man who says he’s her husband,’ explained a girl at my elbow."
"我望了望四周，剩下的女士现在多数都在同她们所谓的丈夫在吵架。就连乔丹的那一伙，从东卵来的那四位，也因为意见不合而散开了。其中一个男的正在兴致勃勃地与一位女演员热情交谈，他的妻子开始时碍于面子，只是满不在乎地付之一笑，可到后来就彻底崩溃了，于是采取了侧面攻击——她时不时地如同一条愤怒的袖脊蛇般突然出现在他身边，对着他的耳朵嘶嘶叫道：“你发过誓的！”","I looked around.Most of the remaining women were now having fights with men said to be their husbands.Even Jordan’s party, the quartet from East Egg, were rent asun—der by dissension.One of the men was talking with curious intensity to a young actress, and his wife after attempting to laugh at the situation in a dignified and indifferent way broke down entirely and resorted to flank attacks—at intervals she appeared suddenly at his side like an angry diamond, and hissed ‘You promised!’ into his ear."
"不愿意回家的并不只有这些醉酒任性的男客。大厅里此刻还有两位意识清醒的男客以及他们的两位怒气冲冲的太太。他们的两位太太用微微抬高的声音在那里相互诉苦。","The reluctance to go home was not confined to wayward men.The hall was at present occupied by two deplorably sober men and their highly indignant wives.The wives were sympathizing with each other in slightly raised voices."
"“只要一看到我玩得很开心，他就要回家，”","‘Whenever he sees I’m having a good time he wants to go home.’"
"“我一辈子都没听说过还有这么自私的人。”“我们总是第一批离开。”“我们也是一样的。”","‘Never heard anything so selfish in my life.’‘We’re always the first ones to leave.’‘So are we.’"
"“唉，今晚我们都快是最后一个离开了。”其中一个男的有些懦怯地说，“管弦乐队半小时以前就走了。”","‘Well, we’re almost the last tonight,’ said one of the men sheepishly.‘The orchestra left half an hour ago.’"
"尽管两位太太都认为这种恶意行为实在让人难以置信，最后他们的争吵以短暂的推拉拽扯告终，两位太太被丈夫抱起来，双脚乱踢着消失在夜色中。","In spite of the wives’ agreement that such malevolence was beyond credibility, the dispute ended in a short struggle, and both wives were lifted kicking into the night."
"我在大厅里等着拿帽子的时候，图书馆的门开了，乔丹·贝克和盖茨比一同走了出来。他正在对她讲最后一句话，可是当几个人走近同他道别时，他那种迫不及待的神态立即变得拘谨严肃。","As I waited for my hat in the hall the door of the library opened and Jordan Baker and Gatsby came out together.He was saying some last word to her but the eagerness in his manner tightened abruptly into formality as several people approached him to say goodbye."
"乔丹的同伴在阳台上非常不耐烦地招呼她过去，可她还是逗留了片刻同我握手。","Jordan’s party were calling impatiently to her from the porch but she lingered for a moment to shake hands."
"“我刚听说了一件非常令人惊讶的事情。”她低声对我说，“我们在里面呆了多久？”“将近一个小时，怎么啦？”","‘I’ve just heard the most amazing thing,’ she whispered.‘How long were we in there?’‘Why,—about an hour.’"
"“真是……太令人惊讶了。”她有些心不在焉地自己重复道，“但是我发过誓我不会说出去，现在只是逗一下你。”她朝着我的脸优雅地打了个呵欠。“有空记得过来找我……电话薄......西戈尼·霍华德太太名下……我的姨妈……”她边说话边匆匆离开了——她轻松活泼地挥动着棕色的手以示道别，接着便消失在门口她那一帮同伴中。","‘It was—simply amazing,’ she repeated abstractedly.‘But I swore I wouldn’t tell it and here I am tantalizing you.’She yawned gracefully in my face.‘Please come and see me....Phone book....Under the name of Mrs. Sigourney Howard....My aunt....’She was hurrying off as she talked—her brown hand waved a jaunty salute as she melted into her party at the door."
"第一次过来就呆到这么晚，我觉得很不好意思，于是我就走到最后一批团团围住盖茨比的客人中间。我想去解释一下，告诉他其实早在傍晚的时候我就开始找他了，还想因为自己在花园里没认出他而向他道歉。","Rather ashamed that on my first appearance I had stayed so late, I joined the last of Gatsby’s guests who were clustered around him.I wanted to explain that I’d hunted for him early in the evening and to apologize for not having known him in the garden."
"“没关系。”他热情地嘱咐我说，“不要多想了，老兄。”他用手轻抚着我的肩膀以示安慰，他的手似乎比那句熟悉的称呼让我更加感到亲切。“别忘了明早九点钟我们要乘水上飞机起飞呢。”","‘Don’t mention it,’ he enjoined me eagerly.‘Don’t give it another thought, old sport.’The familiar expression held no more familiarity than the hand which reassuringly brushed my shoulder.‘And don’t forget we’re going up in the hydroplane tomorrow morning at nine o’clock.’"
"接着管家站在了他的身后。","Then the butler, behind his shoulder:"
"“费城那边有人打电话找您，先生。”","‘Philadelphia wants you on the phone, sir.’"
"“好的，马上。告诉他们我马上就来……晚安。”","‘All right, in a minute.Tell them I’ll be right there.... good night.’"
"“晚安。”","‘Good night.’"
"“晚安。”他微笑着——突然之间我觉得呆到最后一批走，是如此地有意义且让人愉悦，似乎这正是他一直所期待的。“晚安，老兄。晚安。”","‘Good night.’He smiled—and suddenly there seemed to be a pleasant significance in having been among the last to go, as if he had desired it all the time.‘Good night, old sport..Good night.’"
"但是当我走下台阶的时候，我看到的场景告诉我其实晚会还没结束。距离门五十英尺的地方，在十几辆汽车的灯光照射中呈现出一片奇怪混乱的景象。在路旁的水沟里，一辆崭新的小轿车右边朝上躺在那里，其中一只轮胎已经撞没了，而这辆车刚开出盖茨比家的车道还不到两分钟。墙上凸出来的尖尖的部分将轮胎给撞掉了，而现在十几个好奇的司机也正在围观。可是由于他们的车停在那里挡了道，后面便连续传来一阵尖锐刺耳的喇叭噪音，这使得本已喧嚣的场面更加混乱了。","But as I walked down the steps I saw that the evening was not quite over.Fifty feet from the door a dozen headlights illuminated a bizarre and tumultuous scene.In the ditch beside the road, right side up but violently shorn of one wheel, rested a new coupé which had left Gatsby’s drive not two minutes before.The sharp jut of a wall accounted for the detachment of the wheel which was now getting considerable attention from half a dozen curious chauffeurs.However, as they had left their cars blocking the road a harsh discordant din from those in the rear had been audible for some time and added to the already violent confusion of the scene."
"一个身着长风衣的男的从撞坏的汽车里走下来，现在正站在路中央，看了看汽车，又看了看轮胎，接着转头看了看围观的人，一脸很快乐又很困惑的表情。","A man in a long duster had dismounted from the wreck and now stood in the middle of the road, looking from the car to the tire and from the tire to the observers in a pleasant, puzzled way."
"“看！”他解释道，“车子走到沟里去了。”","‘See!’ he explained.‘It went in the ditch.’"
"这一事实可真是让他惊讶不已——我先是听出了那种与众不同的惊讶口吻，然后认出了那个男人——他就是很晚了依旧逗留在盖茨比的图书馆的那位客人。","The fact was infinitely astonishing to him—and I recognized first the unusual quality of wonder and then the man—it was the late patron of Gatsby’s library."
"“怎么可能这样呢？”","‘How’d it happen?’"
"他耸了耸肩膀。","He shrugged his shoulders."
"“我对机械方面可是一窍不通。”他肯定地说。","‘I know nothing whatever about mechanics,’ he said decisively."
"“那到底是怎么回事？你是不是撞到墙上了啊？”","‘But how did it happen?Did you run into the wall?’"
"“别问我，”那位猫头鹰眼镜先生说道，似乎想把整个事情同自己撇清关系，“我对于开车懂得甚少——几乎是一窍不通。事情就这样发生了，这就是我所知道的。”","‘Don’t ask me,’ said Owl Eyes, washing his hands of the whole matter.‘I know very little about driving—next to nothing.It happened, and that’s all I know.’"
"“那，如果你不会开车，你就不应该在晚上尝试开车嘛。”","‘Well, if you’re a poor driver you oughtn’t to try driving at night.’"
"“但是我根本就没尝试，”他非常气愤地解释说，“我根本就没尝试啊。”周边围观的人都诧异地看着，没人出声。“你是想自杀吗？”","‘But I wasn’t even trying,’ he explained indignantly, ‘I wasn’t even trying.’An awed hush fell upon the bystanders.‘Do you want to commit suicide?’"
"“你很幸运了，只是坏了个轮胎！不懂得开车，又不是在尝试！”","‘You’re lucky it was just a wheel!A bad driver and not even TRYing!’"
"“你们不明白。”那男的像罪犯一样解释道，“我刚才没有开车，车里还有一个人。”","‘You don’t understand,’ explained the criminal.‘I wasn’t driving.There’s another man in the car.’"
"他的话音刚落，人群便一片惊愕，连声叫着“哦……啊……啊！”同时，轿车的车门缓缓地开了。人群——此时已经有一群人了——不约而同地向后一退，等车门完全敞开的那一刻，这里被一种阴森可怕的气氛包围着。然后，一个脸色苍白的人摇晃着从撞坏的车内慢慢地、一点一点地跨出来，一只大得不合脚的舞鞋在地上试探了几下。","The shock that followed this declaration found voice in a sustained ‘Ah-h-h!’ as the door of the coupé swung slowly open.The crowd—it was now a crowd—stepped back involuntarily and when the door had opened wide there was a ghostly pause.Then, very gradually, part by part, a pale dangling individual stepped out of the wreck, pawing tentatively at the ground with a large uncertain dancing shoe."
"这个幽灵摇摇晃晃地站在那里，汽车的灯光照得他睁不开眼睛，而那持续不断的鸣笛声搞得他糊里糊涂。过了一会儿，他才认出穿风衣的男的。","Blinded by the glare of the headlights and confused by the incessant groaning of the horns the apparition stood swaying for a moment before he perceived the man in the duster."
"“怎么了？”他平静地问道，“我们没汽油了吗？”“看！”","‘Wha’s matter?’ he inquired calmly.‘Did we run outa gas?’‘Look!’"
"有五六个人用手指着那个掉下来的轮胎——他盯着轮胎看了一会儿，然后向上看看，似乎怀疑轮胎是从天上掉下来的。","Half a dozen fingers pointed at the amputated wheel—he stared at it for a moment and then looked upward as though he suspected that it had dropped from the sky."
"“轮胎掉了。”有人解释说道。","‘It came off,’ some one explained."
"他点了点头。","He nodded."
"“开始我还没注意到我们的车停了。”停了一会儿。接着他深吸了一口气，挺起胸膛，决然说道：“能不能告诉我哪儿有加油站？”至少有五六个人，其中一些还略微比他清醒一点，向他解释说轮胎和车已经完全没有连在一起了。","‘At first I din’ notice we’d stopped.’A pause.Then, taking a long breath and straightening his shoulders he remarked in a determined voice: ‘Wonder’ff tell me where there’s a gas’line station?’At least a dozen men, some of them little better off than he was, explained to him that wheel and car were no longer joined by any physical bond."
"“倒车。”过了一会儿他出主意说，“用倒车档倒。”","‘Back out,’ he suggested after a moment.‘Put her in reverse.’"
"“但是轮胎已经掉了啊！”","‘But the WHEEL’S off!’"
"他犹豫了一下。","He hesitated."
"“试一下也无妨。”他说。","‘No harm in trying,’ he said."
"尖锐的汽笛声越来越刺耳，于是我转身离去，穿过草坪，朝家走去。我回头看了一眼。一轮圆月在上空照耀着盖茨比的房子，夜色如从前一样美好，在这个依旧灯火辉煌的花园里，月色不变，欢声笑语却消失了。此刻一种突如其来的空虚似乎在从那些窗户和那扇巨大的门中涌出来，主人独自一人站在阳台上，享受着这份孤独，他举起一只手，做出非常正式的道别姿势。","The caterwauling horns had reached a crescendo and I turned away and cut across the lawn toward home.I glanced back once.A wafer of a moon was shining over Gatsby’s house, making the night fine as before and surviving the laughter and the sound of his still glowing garden.A sudden emptiness seemed to flow now from the windows and the great doors, endowing with complete isolation the figure of the host who stood on the porch, his hand up in a formal gesture of farewell."
"读一下以上所写，我觉得自己给人的一个印象就是这相隔几周的三个晚上发生的事情是我所关心的。正好相反，它们仅仅是一个拥挤的夏日里非常普通的事情，直到很久以后，我对自己个人私事的关心远胜于这些事情。","Reading over what I have written so far I see I have given the impression that the events of three nights several weeks apart were all that absorbed me.On the contrary they were merely casual events in a crowded summer and, until much later, they absorbed me infinitely less than my personal affairs."
"大多数时间我都在工作。每天，清晨的阳光将我的影子投向西边时，我匆匆忙忙地顺着纽约南边那一个个相隔于高楼间的白色裂缝，向正诚信托公司走去。我与其他的职员和债券销售员很熟，我们中午一起在阴暗拥挤的餐厅吃小猪肉香肠和土豆泥、喝咖啡。我甚至与一个住在泽西城的女孩发生了短短的一段恋情，她在会计部工作。后来由于他的哥哥开始给我眼色看，于是在她七月份出去度假时，我就让这段恋情自然散了。","Most of the time I worked.In the early morning the sun threw my shadow westward as I hurried down the white chasms of lower New York to the Probity Trust.I knew the other clerks and young bond-salesmen by their first names and lunched with them in dark crowded restaurants on little pig sausages and mashed potatoes and coffee.I even had a short affair with a girl who lived in Jersey City and worked in the accounting department, but her brother began throwing mean looks in my direction so when she went on her vacation in July I let it blow quietly away."
"我经常在耶鲁俱乐部吃晚饭——不知为什么，这是我一天当中最沮丧的时候——然后我就去楼上的图书馆勤勤恳恳地学习一个小时投资和证券。俱乐部一般总会有几个吵吵闹闹的人，但是他们从来都不进图书馆，因此这里是个工作的好地方。之后，如果夜色宜人，我就会沿着麦迪逊大道散步，路上经过古老的默里山酒店，穿过三十三号街，来到宾夕法尼亚车站。","I took dinner usually at the Yale Club—for some reason it was the gloomiest event of my day—and then I went upstairs to the library and studied investments and securities for a conscientious hour.There were generally a few rioters around but they never came into the library so it was a good place to work.After that, if the night was mellow I strolled down Madison Avenue past the old Murray Hill Hotel and over Thirty-third Street to the Pennsylvania Station."
"我开始喜欢上纽约了，喜欢这里的夜给人的那种活力与刺激感，以及来来往往的男女和川流不息的车辆给人的视觉满足感。我喜欢沿着第五大道往前走，然后在人群中挑出那些风流女子，幻想着接下来几分钟之内自己就会走进她们的生活，没有人会知道，也没有人会非难。有时候，我会想象着自己跟随她们到她们位于一个隐蔽的街角处的公寓，在门口，她们会回眸一笑，然后就走进门消失在温暖的夜色中。在这个大都市那令人陶醉的暮色中，有时我会感觉到一种难以逃脱的孤独，同时我也会感到别人的孤独——可怜的年轻职员在窗户前面漫无目的地闲逛，等待着在餐厅自己独享的那顿晚餐——暮色里年轻的职员正在虚度着夜晚和人生中最动人的时刻。","I began to like New York, the racy, adventurous feel of it at night and the satisfaction that the constant flicker of men and women and machines gives to the restless eye.I liked to walk up Fifth Avenue and pick out romantic women from the crowd and imagine that in a few minutes I was going to enter into their lives, and no one would ever know or disapprove.Sometimes, in my mind, I followed them to their apartments on the corners of hidden streets, and they turned and smiled back at me before they faded through a door into warm darkness.At the enchanted metropolitan twilight I felt a haunting loneliness sometimes, and felt it in others—poor young clerks who loitered in front of windows waiting until it was time for a solitary restaurant dinner—young clerks in the dusk, wasting the most poignant moments of night and life."
"同样在晚上八点，四十几号街黑暗的小巷里五辆一排的出租车颠簸前行，载着人们向剧院那边街区走去，此刻我的心里就会感到一种失落。出租车停下来的时候，就能看到车上的人倚靠在一起，有歌唱声，有不知什么笑话引起的欢笑声，还有燃着的香烟下那奇怪的姿势。想象着自己也同样匆匆地赶去寻欢作乐，以此分享他们那种亲密的兴奋，我为他们祝福。","Again at eight o’clock, when the dark lanes of the Forties were five deep with throbbing taxi cabs, bound for the theatre district, I felt a sinking in my heart.Forms leaned together in the taxis as they waited, and voices sang, and there was laughter from unheard jokes, and lighted cigarettes outlined unintelligible gestures inside.Imagining that I, too, was hurrying toward gayety and sharing their intimate excitement, I wished them well."
"我已经有一些时间没有见到乔丹了。后来在仲夏时节，我再次见到了她。能和她一起到处走，起初我感到非常荣幸，因为她是高尔夫球冠军，大家都认识她。后来另外一种感情萌发了。实际上我并不是爱上她了，我只是觉得有那么一点好奇。面对这个世界，她脸上表现出的那种冷淡与傲慢的背后，似乎隐藏着一些什么——大多数做作的表现最终总是有所隐藏，即便最初并非如此——而且有一天我发现了她所隐藏的是什么。当时我们两个一起在沃里克参加别墅宴会，她将一辆借来的车敞开车篷停在了雨里，后来对此还撒了谎——突然我想起了一件都快忘得差不多的事，就是那天在黛西家里关于她的事情。在她的第一场盛大的高尔夫锦标赛中，发生了一场风波，差点上报了——有人说在半决赛的时候她从一个极其不利的位置上移动了球。这件事情差点被闹成一桩丑闻——然后就渐渐平息了。一个球童收回了陈述，而另外一个目击者也承认自己可能是搞错了。这一事件连同她的名字依旧留在我的记忆里。","For a while I lost sight of Jordan Baker, and then in midsummer I found her again.At first I was flattered to go places with her because she was a golf champion and every one knew her name.Then it was something more.I wasn’t actually in love, but I felt a sort of tender curiosity.The bored haughty face that she turned to the world concealed something—most affectations conceal something eventually, even though they don’t in the beginning—and one day I found what it was.When we were on a house-party together up in Warwick, she left a borrowed car out in the rain with the top down, and then lied about it—and suddenly I remembered the story about her that had eluded me that night at Daisy’s.At her first big golf tournament there was a row that nearly reached the newspapers—a suggestion that she had moved her ball from a bad lie in the semi-final round.The thing approached the proportions of a scandal—then died away.A caddy retracted his statement and the only other witness admitted that he might have been mistaken.The incident and the name had remained together in my mind."
"乔丹·贝克本能地回避精明的男人，现在我明白这是因为坐在一架没有任何偏离航线可能性的飞机上，她会感觉更安全。她的不诚实已无可救药。她忍受不了自己处于劣势，正是由于这种不甘心，我觉得她年轻的时候就已经开始利用一些花招手段来保持自己面对世人时的那种冷淡与傲慢的微笑，从而满足她那洋洋得意的肢体的需求。","Jordan Baker instinctively avoided clever shrewd men and now I saw that this was because she felt safer on a plane where any divergence from a code would be thought impos—sible.She was incurably dishonest.She wasn’t able to endure being at a disadvantage, and given this unwillingness I suppose she had begun dealing in subterfuges when she was very young in order to keep that cool, insolent smile turned to the world and yet satisfy the demands of her hard jaunty body."
"我对这个并不在意。女人的不诚实永远都是无可厚非的——我只是感到有点遗憾，随后就忘了。就是参加那次别墅宴会的时候，我们有过一次关于开车的奇怪谈话。起因是她开车的时候从几个工人身旁经过，车子离工人非常近，结果挡泥板还碰到了其中一个工人的衣扣。","It made no difference to me.Dishonesty in a woman is a thing you never blame deeply—I was casually sorry, and then I forgot.It was on that same house party that we had a curious conversation about driving a car.It started because she passed so close to some workmen that our fender flicked a button on one man’s coat."
"“你可不是个好司机。”我提出了抗议，“你要么就应该多加小心，要么就干脆别开车了。”","‘You’re a rotten driver,’ I protested.‘Either you ought to be more careful or you oughtn’t to drive at all.’"
"“我很小心。”","‘I am careful.’"
"“不，你并不小心。”","‘No, you’re not.’"
"“嗯，那其他人会小心的。”她很轻松地说，“这和开车又有什么关系呢？”","‘Well, other people are,’ she said lightly.‘What’s that got to do with it?’"
"“他们会给我让路。”她坚决地说，“要双方都不小心才会发生交通事故的。”","‘They’ll keep out of my way,’ she insisted.‘It takes two to make an accident.’"
"“那假若你遇到和你一样不小心的人呢？”","‘Suppose you met somebody just as careless as yourself.’"
"“希望我永远不会遇到。”她回答说，“我讨厌粗心的人。这正是我喜欢你的原因。”","‘I hope I never will,’ she answered.‘I hate careless people.That’s why I like you.’"
"她那灰色的眼睛在阳光下紧眯着，注视着前方，但是她是在有意改变我们的关系。于是那一刻，我觉得自己爱上了她。但是我反应迟钝，而且满脑子都装满了清规戒律，以此来控制自己的各种欲望，并且我还知道自己首先要做的是彻底摆脱家乡的那段感情纠葛。我一直以来坚持每周写一封信，并且署上“爱你，尼克”，同时我所想的也是，在那个女孩打网球时，她上唇出现的像小胡子一般的汗珠的模样。无论如何，只有巧妙地摆脱了这种含含糊糊的默契，我才能获得自由。","Her grey, sun-strained eyes stared straight ahead, but she had deliberately shifted our relations, and for a moment I thought I loved her.But I am slow-thinking and full of interior rules that act as brakes on my desires, and I knew that first I had to get myself definitely out of that tangle back home.I’d been writing letters once a week and signing them: ‘Love, Nick,’ and all I could think of was how, when that certain girl played tennis, a faint mustache of perspiration appeared on her upper lip.Nevertheless there was a vague understanding that had to be tactfully broken off before I was free."
"每个人都觉得自己至少拥有一种基本的美德，那我的美德就是：我是我所认识的人当中为数不多的诚实的一个。","Every one suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and this is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever known."
"第四章","Chapter 4"
"星期天的早上，海滨村庄教堂里的钟声响起的时候，男男女女便回到了盖茨比的别墅，在他的草坪上寻欢作乐。","On Sunday morning while church bells rang in the villages along shore the world and its mistress returned to Gatsby’s house and twinkled hilariously on his lawn."
"“他是一个走私犯。”一位年轻女士一边说，一边端着他的鸡尾酒在他的花丛中走动，“他曾经杀了一个人，因为那个人查明了他是冯·兴登堡的侄子，魔鬼的表兄弟。给我摘朵玫瑰花，亲爱的，往那个水晶杯里再给我倒最后一滴酒。”","‘He’s a bootlegger,’ said the young ladies, moving somewhere between his cocktails and his flowers.‘One time he killed a man who had found out that he was nephew to von Hindenburg and second cousin to the devil.Reach me a rose, honey, and pour me a last drop into that there crystal glass.’"
"有一次我在一张时刻表的空白处记录下了那年夏天来过盖茨比别墅的客人的名字。现在那张时刻表已经非常旧了，折叠处都已破裂，表头上印着“此表1922年7月5日起生效”。但是我依然可以认出那些发灰的名字，这些名字比起我的笼统概括，会让你对盖茨比的客人有个清楚的认识。这些受到盖茨比盛情款待的客人对于他本人毫不了解，只是怀有那么一点敬意。","Once I wrote down on the empty spaces of a time-table the names of those who came to Gatsby’s house that summer.It is an old time-table now, disintegrating at its folds and headed ‘This schedule in effect July 5th, 1922.’But I can still read the grey names and they will give you a better impression than my generalities of those who accepted Gatsby’s hospitality and paid him the subtle tribute of knowing nothing whatever about him."
"从东卵来的有切斯特·贝克尔夫妇、利奇夫妇、一个我在耶鲁认识的姓本森的男的，还有去年夏天在缅因州已经淹死的韦伯斯特·西维特大夫。另外还有霍恩比姆夫妇、威利·伏尔泰夫妇和布莱克巴克全家，他们总是聚集在一个角落，像山羊一样翘着鼻子看着周边的人。以及伊斯梅夫妇、克里斯蒂夫妇(更确切点是休伯特·奥尔巴克和克里斯蒂先生的夫人。)还有埃德加·比弗，据说他的头发在一个冬季的下午无缘无故就变得像棉花一样白。","From East Egg, then, came the Chester Beckers and the Leeches and a man named Bunsen whom I knew at Yale and Doctor Webster Civet who was drowned last summer up in Maine.And the Hornbeams and the Willie Voltaires and a whole clan named Blackbuck who always gathered in a corner and flipped up their noses like goats at whosoever came near.And the Ismays and the Chrysties (or rather Hubert Auerbach and Mr. Chrystie’s wife) and Edgar Beaver, whose hair they say turned cotton-white one winter afternoon for no good reason at all."
"在我的记忆里，克拉伦斯·恩狄来自东卵。她只来过一次，那次穿着一条白色的灯笼裤，还和一个姓艾蒂的小混混在花园里打了一架。从岛上更远一点的地方来的有奇德尔夫妇、Ｏ. R. P. 斯雷德夫妇、乔治亚州的斯通·杰克逊·艾布拉姆夫妇、菲希加德夫妇，还有里普利·斯内尔夫妇。斯内尔在入狱的三天前还来过，他喝得酩酊大醉躺在石子儿车道上，结果尤利赛斯·斯韦特夫妇的汽车从他的右手上碾了过去。丹西夫妇也来了，还有年近七十的S. B. 怀特贝特、莫里斯·Ａ. 弗林克、汉默海德夫妇、烟草进口商贝路加以及他的几个女孩。   ","Clarence Endive was from East Egg, as I remember.He came only once, in white knickerbockers, and had a fight with a bum named Etty in the garden.From farther out on the Island came the Cheadles and the O. R. P. Schraed-ers and the Stonewall Jackson Abrams of Georgia and the Fishguards and the Ripley Snells.Snell was there three days before he went to the penitentiary, so drunk out on the gravel drive that Mrs. Ulysses Swett’s automobile ran over his right hand.The Dancies came too and S. B. Whitebait, who was well over sixty, and Maurice A. Flink and the Hammerheads and Beluga the tobacco importer and Beluga’s girls."
"从西卵来的有波尔夫妇、马尔雷迪夫妇、塞西尔·罗巴克、塞西尔·舍恩、州议员久利克，还有卓越影片公司老总牛顿·奥基德、艾克豪斯特和克莱德·科恩、唐·S. 施瓦茨（儿子）以及阿瑟·麦卡蒂，他们都和电影界有着各种各样的联系。　还有卡特利普夫妇、班姆堡夫妇和Ｇ. 厄尔·马尔登，以及马尔登的哥哥，后来他将自己的妻子亲手掐死了。经纪人达·冯坦诺来过，还有埃德·勒格罗、詹姆斯·Ｂ.（绰号“坏心肠”）费里特、德·琼夫妇和厄恩斯特·利利——他们都来这里赌钱，当费里特散漫地溜达进花园的时候，就说明他已经输得精光了，联合运输公司的股票在第二天将会盈利性地波动。","From West Egg came the Poles and the Mulreadys and Cecil Roebuck and Cecil Schoen and Gulick the state senator and Newton Orchid who controlled Films Par Excellence and Eckhaust and Clyde Cohen and Don S. Schwartze (the son) and Arthur McCarty, all connected with the movies in one way or another.And the Catlips and the Bembergs and G. Earl Muldoon, brother to that Muldoon who afterward strangled his wife.Da Fontano the promoter came there, and Ed Legros and James B. (”Rot-Gut’) Ferret and the De Jongs and Ernest Lilly—they came to gamble and when Ferret wandered into the garden it meant he was cleaned out and Associated Traction would have to fluctuate profitably next day."
"一个姓克利斯普林格的男的经常来这儿，而且一来就呆很久，所以大家都叫他“房客”——我都怀疑他是否有自己的家。戏剧表演者有格斯·威兹、霍勒斯·奥多诺万、莱斯特·迈耶、乔治·德克维德和弗朗西斯·布尔。从纽约来的有克罗姆夫妇、贝克海森夫妇、丹尼克夫妇、拉塞尔·贝蒂、科里根夫妇、凯瑟赫夫妇、迪尤尔夫妇、斯科里夫妇、Ｓ.Ｗ.贝尔彻、斯默克夫妇、现在已经离婚的小奎因夫妇，还有亨利·Ｌ.帕默多，后来他在时代广场跳到一列地铁前卧轨自杀了。  ","A man named Klipspringer was there so often and so long that he became known as ‘the boarder’—I doubt if he had any other home.Of theatrical people there were Gus Waize and Horace O’Donavan and Lester Meyer and George Duckweed and Francis Bull.Also from New York were the Chromes and the Backhyssons and the Dennick-ers and Russel Betty and the Corrigans and the Kellehers and the Dewars and the Scullys and S. W. Belcher and the Smirkes and the young Quinns, divorced now, and Henry L. Palmetto who killed himself by jumping in front of a subway train in Times Square."
"本尼·麦克莱纳亨总是带着四个女孩一起来。　　她们长得不完全相同，但是打扮得一模一样，难免看上去像是以前来过似的。我已经忘了她们的名字——杰奎琳吧，要不就是康雪爱拉，或是格洛丽亚或是朱迪或是琼，她们的姓是悦耳动听的花名和月份名，或者是美国大资本家威严的姓氏，如果非要逼问，她们就会承认自己是那些人的表亲。","Benny McClenahan arrived always with four girls.They were never quite the same ones in physical person but they were so identical one with another that it inevitably seemed they had been there before.I have forgotten their names—Jaqueline, I think, or else Consuela or Gloria or Judy or June, and their last names were either the melodious names of flowers and months or the sterner ones of the great American capitalists whose cousins, if pressed, they would confess themselves to be."
"除了这些人之外，我还记得福斯蒂娜·奥布莱恩至少来过一次，贝达克家的女孩们，还有战争中鼻子被枪打掉的小布鲁尔，还有阿尔布鲁克斯堡先生和他的未婚妻哈格小姐，还有阿迪泰·菲茨-彼得夫妇、曾经担任过美国退伍军人协会主席的卜朱伊特先生和以其所谓的男司机为伴的克劳迪娅·希普小姐，还有某王子，我们都叫他公爵，即便我以前知道他的名字，现在也忘掉了。  ","In addition to all these I can remember that Faustina O’Brien came there at least once and the Baedeker girls and young Brewer who had his nose shot off in the war and Mr. Albrucksburger and Miss Haag, his fiancee, and Ardita Fitz-Peters, and Mr. P. Jewett, once head of the American Legion, and Miss Claudia Hip with a man reputed to be her chauffeur, and a prince of something whom we called Duke and whose name, if I ever knew it, I have forgotten."
"所有这些人那年夏天都来过盖茨比的别墅。","All these people came to Gatsby’s house in the summer."
"七月下旬的一天早上九点钟，盖茨比的豪车顺着石子车道颠簸而上来到我家门口，三个音调的喇叭齐鸣，发出悦耳的响声。虽然我已经去他家参加过两次晚会了，乘坐过他的水上飞机，而且在他的盛情邀请之下频繁享用他的私人沙滩，但他来我家却还是第一次。","At nine o’clock, one morning late in July Gatsby’s gorgeous car lurched up the rocky drive to my door and gave out a burst of melody from its three noted horn.It was the first time he had called on me though I had gone to two of his parties, mounted in his hydroplane, and, at his urgent invitation, made frequent use of his beach."
"“早上好，老兄。你中午和我一起吃午饭吧，我想我们就一起乘车进城。”","‘Good morning, old sport.You’re having lunch with me today and I thought we’d ride up together.’"
"他靠在汽车仪表板上保持着身体的平衡，一边还做着美国人特有的各种小动作——我觉得那可能是由于年轻的时候没干过重活或者经常坐着不动的缘故，更可能是因为我们不定时地进行各种剧烈运动而形成的很自然的优雅。这些动作时不时被他那不安中流露出的拘谨打断。他一刻都不会静止，不是用脚轻拍着什么地方，就是毫不耐烦地将一只手掌一开一合。","He was balancing himself on the dashboard of his car with that resourcefulness of movement that is so peculiarly American—that comes, I suppose, with the absence of lifting work or rigid sitting in youth and, even more, with the formless grace of our nervous, sporadic games.This quality was continually breaking through his punctilious manner in the shape of restlessness.He was never quite still; there was always a tapping foot somewhere or the impatient opening and closing of a hand."
"他看到我用羡慕的目光看着他的汽车。","He saw me looking with admiration at his car."
"“车子很漂亮，是吧，老兄。”他从车上跳下来，好让我看得更清楚一点，“你以前从来没见过这种车吗？”","‘It’s pretty, isn’t it, old sport.’He jumped off to give me a better view.‘Haven’t you ever seen it before?’"
"我见到过。大家都看到过。车子是华丽的奶油色，镀镍的地方闪闪发光，车身超长无比，上面鼓出来各种各样的盒子，有帽子盒、晚餐盒和工具盒，迷宫一样的挡风玻璃上映射着十几个太阳齐放光芒。我们在如同温室一般的绿皮车厢里，坐在层层的玻璃后面，启程开往城里。","I’d seen it.Everybody had seen it.It was a rich cream color, bright with nickel, swollen here and there in its monstrous length with triumphant hatboxes and supper-boxes and tool-boxes, and terraced with a labyrinth of windshields that mirrored a dozen suns.Sitting down behind many layers of glass in a sort of green leather conservatory we started to town."
"过去一个月里我和他交谈过五六次。让我感到失望的是，他的话很少。因此，他在我第一印象里那种模糊不确定的形象逐渐退去，而他也只不过是隔壁豪华客栈的老板。","I had talked with him perhaps half a dozen times in the past month and found, to my disappointment, that he had little to say.So my first impression, that he was a person of some undefined consequence, had gradually faded and he had become simply the proprietor of an elaborate road-house next door."
"接着就开始了令我困窘不安的一程。我们还没到西卵，盖茨比就开始文文雅雅地将话说到一半，便犹豫不定地用手拍打着自己酱色西服下的膝盖。","And then came that disconcerting ride.We hadn’t reached West Egg village before Gatsby began leaving his elegant sentences unfinished and slapping himself indecisively on the knee of his caramel-colored suit."
"“看，老兄，”他出人意料地大声问道，“你究竟觉得我这个人怎么样？”","‘Look here, old sport,’ he broke out surprisingly.‘What’s your opinion of me, anyhow?’"
"我有点不知所措，开始含糊其辞、敷衍回答。","A little overwhelmed, I began the generalized evasions which that question deserves."
"“好吧，我来给你讲讲我的身世。”他打断我的话说道，“我不想你听信一些谣言而对我产生错误的认识。”","‘Well, I’m going to tell you something about my life,’ he interrupted.‘I don’t want you to get a wrong idea of me from all these stories you hear.’"
"原来他已经知道了在大厅里客人们当作谈资的那些离奇的流言。","So he was aware of the bizarre accusations that flavored conversation in his halls."
"“上帝作证，我对你讲的都是实话。”他突然举起右手，以示愿意接受上天任何惩罚，“我是中西部一个富家子弟——家里人已经全都去世了。我在美国长大，在牛津上学，因为多年来，我的祖辈们一直都在牛津读书。这是我们家族传统。”","‘I’ll tell you God’s truth.’His right hand suddenly ordered divine retribution to stand by.‘I am the son of some wealthy people in the middle-west—all dead now.I was brought up in America but educated at Oxford because all my ancestors have been educated there for many years.It is a family tradition.’"
"他斜着眼睛看了看我——这时我明白了为什么乔丹·贝克曾认定他在说谎。他将“在牛津上学”这句话匆匆忙忙地一带而过，含含糊糊地咕哝了一句，似乎他以前就因为这句话遇到过麻烦。而且因为这种犹豫，他说起话来也是断断续续地，我都在怀疑他是否真是干过些凶恶的事。","He looked at me sideways—and I knew why Jordan Baker had believed he was lying.He hurried the phrase ‘educated at Oxford,’ or swallowed it or choked on it as though it had bothered him before.And with this doubt his whole statement fell to pieces and I wondered if there wasn’t something a little sinister about him after all."
"“中西部哪一块儿啊？”我随便问了一句。","‘What part of the middle-west?’I inquired casually."
"“旧金山。”“知道了。”","‘San Francisco.’‘I see.’"
"“我的家人都去世了，于是我就继承了一大笔的钱。”","‘My family all died and I came into a good deal of money.’"
"他的声音很沉重，似乎那次突发的毁灭性的家族灾难在他的心头依旧留有阴影。有一阵子，我还以为他在和我开玩笑，可是瞥了他一眼之后，我才明白其实并非如此。","His voice was solemn as if the memory of that sudden extinction of a clan still haunted him.For a moment I suspected that he was pulling my leg but a glance at him convinced me otherwise."
"“从此以后，我就像一个年轻王子一样在欧洲各国首都当寓公——巴黎、威尼斯、罗马——收藏红宝石为主的各种珠宝、在野外打打猎、画点画儿，仅供自己消遣，忘掉那些让自己伤痛不已的往事。”","‘After that I lived like a young rajah in all the capitals of Europe—Paris, Venice, Rome—collecting jewels, chiefly rubies, hunting big game, painting a little, things for myself only, and trying to forget something very sad that had happened to me long ago.’"
"我好不容易才控制住自己怀疑的笑声。这些话语是如此地陈腐老套，让人不得不联想到戏剧里的一个头裹毛巾的角色，在布龙森林一边追着老虎跑，一边从一个个空洞往身后漏木屑。","With an effort I managed to restrain my incredulous laughter.The very phrases were worn so threadbare that they evoked no image except that of a turbaned ‘character’ leaking sawdust at every pore as he pursued a tiger through the Bois de Boulogne."
"“后来战争爆发了，老兄。这对我来说真是莫大的解脱方式，于是我试图让自己死于战场，但是我的生命似乎有一种魔力。战争开始时，我被任命为中尉。在阿尔贡森林战役中，我带领着两个机枪连分队向前挺进，将左右两边扫出半英里的空地，步兵根本无法前行。我们一百三十个人带着十六支刘易斯式机枪，在那儿呆了两天两夜。步兵最后到来的时候，在一堆堆的尸体中发现了三个德国师的徽章。我被提升为少校，而且同盟国政府也都给我颁发了勋章——甚至包括蒙特内格罗，安德里亚海上小小的蒙特内格罗啊！”小小的蒙特内格罗！说到这几个字的时候，他便抬高了声音，不断地点着头——脸上带着微笑。这种微笑包含着对于蒙特内格罗动乱史的了解，同时也流露出对蒙特内格罗英勇奋战的人民的同情。它同时表明了对于这个国家一系列现状的了解，而正是这种现状使得小小的蒙特内格罗由衷萌发了这种赞颂。我的怀疑消失了，现在已被他的故事深深地吸引，那种感觉就像在匆匆浏览着十几本杂志。","‘Then came the war, old sport.It was a great relief and I tried very hard to die but I seemed to bear an enchanted life.I accepted a commission as first lieutenant when it began.In the Argonne Forest I took two machine-gun detachments so far forward that there was a half mile gap on either side of us where the infantry couldn’t advance.We stayed there two days and two nights, a hundred and thirty men with sixteen Lewis guns, and when the infantry came up at last they found the insignia of three German divisions among the piles of dead.I was promoted to be a major and every Allied government gave me a decoration—even Montenegro, little Montenegro down on the Adriatic Sea!’Little Montenegro!He lifted up the words and nodded at them—with his smile.The smile comprehended Montenegro’s troubled history and sympathized with the brave struggles of the Montenegrin people.It appreciated fully the chain of national circumstances which had elicited this tribute from Montenegro’s warm little heart.My incredulity was submerged in fascination now; it was like skimming hastily through a dozen magazines."
"他伸手从口袋里拿出一枚吊在一条丝带上的金属片，然后放在我的手掌心：","He reached in his pocket and a piece of metal, slung on a ribbon, fell into my palm."
"“这就是蒙特内格罗的那一块。”","‘That’s the one from Montenegro.’"
"让我吃惊的是，这东西看上去像是真的。","To my astonishment, the thing had an authentic look."
"“丹尼罗勋章”，周边一圈写道：“蒙特内格罗，尼古拉斯·雷克斯”","Orderi di Danilo, ran the circular legend, Montenegro, Nicolas Rex."
"“把它翻过来。”","‘Turn it.’"
"“杰伊·盖茨比上校，”我读道，“英勇无比。”","Major Jay Gatsby, I read, For Valour Extraordinary."
"“这儿还有另外一件我随身携带的东西。牛津时代的纪念品。这是在三一学校校园里拍的——我左边的那个人现在是唐卡斯特伯爵。”","‘Here’s another thing I always carry.A souvenir of Oxford days.It was taken in Trinity Quad—the man on my left is now the Earl of Dorcaster.’"
"照片上有五六个身着亮色运动夹克的年轻人，在一条拱廊里随意走着，从拱廊望出去可以看到许多的塔尖。照片里的盖茨比看起来比现在年轻一点，但也没年轻多少——手里握着一根板球棒。","It was a photograph of half a dozen young men in blazers loafing in an archway through which were visible a host of spires.There was Gatsby, looking a little, not much, young-er—with a cricket bat in his hand."
"这样看来他所讲的都是真的。我仿佛看到了他那大运河畔宫殿里挂着的一张张色彩斑斓的虎皮，看到了他正在打开一箱子的红宝石，借着那深红色的光芒抚慰着自己那颗破碎的心。","Then it was all true.I saw the skins of tigers flaming in his palace on the Grand Canal; I saw him opening a chest of rubies to ease, with their crimson-lighted depths, the gnaw-ings of his broken heart."
"“今天我想让你帮我个大忙，”他边说边很满足地将自己的纪念物放在口袋里，“所以我觉得你应该对我有所了解。我不希望你把我当成那种不三不四的人。你知道，我经常置身于一群陌生人当中，是因为我经常到处漂泊，试图忘却那些曾经令自己伤痛不已的往事。”他犹豫了一会儿，“你今天下午就会听说的。”“吃午饭的时候吗？”","‘I’m going to make a big request of you today,’ he said, pocketing his souvenirs with satisfaction, ‘so I thought you ought to know something about me.I didn’t want you to think I was just some nobody.You see, I usually find myself among strangers because I drift here and there trying to forget the sad thing that happened to me.’He hesitated.‘You’ll hear about it this afternoon.’‘At lunch?’"
"“不，是今天下午。我碰巧听说你约贝克小姐一起喝茶。”","‘No, this afternoon.I happened to find out that you’re taking Miss Baker to tea.’"
"“你是说你爱上了贝克小姐？”","‘Do you mean you’re in love with Miss Baker?’"
"“不是的，老兄，我可没有。但是贝克小姐非常善良地同意和你谈这件事情。”","‘No, old sport, I’m not.But Miss Baker has kindly consented to speak to you about this matter.’"
"我一点儿都不明白他所谓的“这件事情”指的是什么，但是比起感兴趣，我更感到生气。我约乔丹一起喝茶，也并不是为了谈论杰伊·盖茨比先生。我敢肯定他提过的“帮忙”也一定是什么荒谬的事情，那时我还真有点后悔自己当初踏上他那人山人海的大草坪。","I hadn’t the faintest idea what ‘this matter’ was, but I was more annoyed than interested.I hadn’t asked Jordan to tea in order to discuss Mr. Jay Gatsby.I was sure the request would be something utterly fantastic and for a moment I was sorry I’d ever set foot upon his overpopulated lawn."
"他没有再多说什么。我们离城市越来越近了，他也变得越来越矜持了。我们经过了罗斯福港口，瞥见一艘艘远洋轮船，船身上涂着一道红色油漆。我们又从贫民窟的石子路上疾驰而过，沿路都是酒馆，没有了二十世纪的光彩，很阴暗，却依旧有客人光顾。接着又穿过了那个飞灰笼罩的山谷，我们开车经过时，只见威尔森夫人在加油机旁气喘吁吁地卖力干着活。","He wouldn’t say another word.His correctness grew on him as we neared the city.We passed Port Roosevelt, where there was a glimpse of red-belted ocean-going ships, and sped along a cobbled slum lined with the dark, undeserted saloons of the faded gilt nineteen-hundreds.Then the valley of ashes opened out on both sides of us, and I had a glimpse of Mrs. Wilson straining at the garage pump with panting vitality as we went by."
"汽车挡泥板像翅膀一样伸展开来，我们的灯光照亮了半个阿斯托利亚——仅仅是半个，因为当我们在高架桥的柱子中间绕来绕去的时候，我听到熟悉的机动车响声“嘟——嘟——噼啪”，接着看到一个性情狂暴的警察开着车子行驶在我们旁边。","With fenders spread like wings we scattered light through half Astoria—only half, for as we twisted among the pillars of the elevated I heard the familiar ‘jug—jug—SPAT!’ of a motor cycle, and a frantic policeman rode alongside."
"“好啦，老兄。”盖茨比大声说道。我们的车慢了下来。他从钱包里取出一张白色的卡片，然后在那个警察的眼前晃了晃。","‘All right, old sport,’ called Gatsby.We slowed down.Taking a white card from his wallet he waved it before the man’s eyes."
"“原来是您，”警察一边回应说着，一边用手轻轻扶了一下帽子，“下次就认识您了，盖茨比先生。很抱歉！”","‘Right you are,’ agreed the policeman, tipping his cap.‘Know you next time, Mr. Gatsby.Excuse ME!’"
"“那是什么啊？”我问道，“是牛津大学的那张照片吗？”","‘What was that?’I inquired.‘The picture of Oxford?’"
"“我以前帮过警察局长一个忙，他便每年都给我寄一张圣诞贺卡。”","‘I was able to do the commissioner a favor once, and he sends me a Christmas card every year.’"
"大桥的上面，阳光透过桥架，照耀在来来往往的汽车上，射出一道道流动的光芒，还能看见河流对岸耸起的城市，一座座白色的大厦和那些像糖块儿一样的矮房子，但愿这都是用正当的钱所建。从皇后区的这座桥上望去，这座城市总是像初次看到的那样新奇，充满着人世间所有的神秘与美丽。","Over the great bridge, with the sunlight through the girders making a constant flicker upon the moving cars, with the city rising up across the river in white heaps and sugar lumps all built with a wish out of non-olfactory money.The city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always the city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of all the mystery and the beauty in the world."
"一辆堆满了鲜花的灵车从我们身旁经过，后面跟着两辆帘子拉得严严实实的马车，还跟了一辆比较舒适的马车，车上载着亲友。亲友们带着悲伤的眼神朝车外望着我们，他们那短短的上唇告诉我们他们是来自东南欧一带的。我很高兴他们在这个忧伤的出丧日可以看到盖茨比的这辆豪华汽车。正当我们穿过布莱克韦尔岛的时候，一辆豪华轿车从我们旁边开过，里面是一个白人司机，还有两男一女三个穿着时髦的黑人坐在车上。他们咕咕噜噜转着眼珠子，带着一种不甘示弱的傲慢表情看着我们，我大笑起来。","A dead man passed us in a hearse heaped with blooms, followed by two carriages with drawn blinds and by more cheerful carriages for friends.The friends looked out at us with the tragic eyes and short upper lips of south-eastern Europe, and I was glad that the sight of Gatsby’s splendid car was included in their somber holiday.As we crossed Blackwell’s Island a limousine passed us, driven by a white chauffeur, in which sat three modish Negroes, two bucks and a girl.I laughed aloud as the yolks of their eyeballs rolled toward us in haughty rivalry."
"“我们一旦过了这座桥，任何事情都可能发生，”我心里想着，“不管是什么事情……”","‘Anything can happen now that we’ve slid over this bridge,’ I thought; ‘anything at all____’"
"就连盖茨比这样的人都有，就没有什么不可能发生的奇迹了。","Even Gatsby could happen, without any particular wonder."
"喧嚣的中午。在四十二街的一个装满风扇的地下餐厅，我和盖茨比见面，一起吃午饭。我眯着眼睛看着外边阳光灿烂的街道，隐约看到盖茨比在休息室和另外一个男的在谈话。","Roaring noon.In a well-fanned Forty-second Street cel—lar I met Gatsby for lunch.Blinking away the brightness of the street outside my eyes picked him out obscurely in the anteroom, talking to another man."
"“卡拉韦先生，这是我的朋友沃尔夫山姆先生。”","‘Mr. Carraway this is my friend Mr. Wolfshiem.’"
"一个个头矮小，鼻子扁平的犹太人抬起大脑袋看着我，鼻孔里长着浓密的两撮鼻毛。过了一会儿，在半明半暗的光线中，我发现他长着一双小眼睛。","A small, flat-nosed Jew raised his large head and regarded me with two fine growths of hair which luxuriated in either nostril.After a moment I discovered his tiny eyes in the half darkness."
"“……于是我看了他一眼……”沃尔夫山姆先生边说边热情地握着我的手，“……后来你猜我干了什么？”","‘—so I took one look at him—’ said Mr. Wolfshiem, shaking my hand earnestly, ‘—and what do you think I did?’"
"“什么啊？”我很礼貌地询问道。","‘What?’I inquired politely."
"但是他显然没有和我讲话，因为他放开我的手，转头将那表情丰富的鼻子朝向了盖茨比。","But evidently he was not addressing me for he dropped my hand and covered Gatsby with his expressive nose."
"“我把钱递给了凯兹保，并对他说：‘好了，凯兹保，他要是不闭上他那张嘴，就别给他一分钱。’结果他当下就闭嘴了。”","‘I handed the money to Katspaugh and I said, ‘All right, Katspaugh, don’t pay him a penny till he shuts his mouth.’He shut it then and there.’"
"盖茨比挽着我们俩的胳膊，一块儿向前走进了餐厅，沃尔夫山姆先生似乎想要说什么，但又咽了回去，露出一副梦游般呆滞的表情。","Gatsby took an arm of each of us and moved forward into the restaurant whereupon Mr. Wolfshiem swallowed a new sentence he was starting and lapsed into a somnambu-latory abstraction."
"“要姜汁威士忌吗？”服务员领班问道。","‘Highballs?’ asked the head waiter."
"“这儿这家饭店挺好的，”沃尔夫山姆先生一边望着天花板上的长老会美女，一边说道，“但是我更喜欢马路对面的那家。”","‘This is a nice restaurant here,’ said Mr. Wolfshiem looking at the Presbyterian nymphs on the ceiling.‘But I like across the street better!’"
"“好，就要姜汁威士忌，”盖茨比答应着说道，然后又对沃尔夫山姆先生说道：“那边太热了。”","‘Yes, highballs,’ agreed Gatsby, and then to Mr. Wolf-shiem: ‘It’s too hot over there.’"
"“又热又小——是啊，”沃尔夫山姆先生说，“可满是回忆呀。”","‘Hot and small—yes,’ said Mr. Wolfshiem, ‘but full of memories.’"
"“那是什么地方啊？”我问道。“旧时的大都会。”","‘What place is that?’I asked.‘The old Metropole.'"
"“旧时的大都会。”沃尔夫山姆先生若有所思又有些伤感地说道，“那里满是一张张已经消逝的面孔。满是一个个永远地离开了这个世界的朋友。只要我活着，我就不会忘记他们开枪打死罗西·罗森塔尔那个晚上。我们六个人一桌，罗西那天晚上一直大吃大喝。等快到清晨的时候，服务员表情很奇怪地走到他跟前对他说外面有人找他有话说。‘好的。’罗西说着就站起身来，我一把将他拉回到椅子上，","‘The old Metropole,’ brooded Mr. Wolfshiem gloomily.‘Filled with faces dead and gone.Filled with friends gone now forever.I can’t forget so long as I live the night they shot Rosy Rosenthal there.It was six of us at the table and Rosy had eat and drunk a lot all evening.When it was almost morning the waiter came up to him with a funny look and says somebody wants to speak to him outside.‘All right,’ says Rosy and begins to get up and I pulled him down in his chair."
"‘如果那些杂种们想找你，就让他们自己进来，罗西，就算是帮我的忙，你千万不能出这间房子。’”","‘ Let the bastards come in here if they want you, Rosy, but don’t you, so help me, move outside this room.’’"
"“那时正是凌晨四点钟，只要我们撩开窗帘就能看得见晨光。”","‘It was four o’clock in the morning then, and if we’d of raised the blinds we’d of seen daylight.’"
"“他出去了吗？”我天真地问。","‘Did he go?’I asked innocently."
"“当然他去了，”沃尔夫山姆先生非常气愤地向我甩了甩鼻子，“他走到门口还回头说：‘别让服务员收走我的咖啡！’然后他出门走到人行道上，他们就朝着他那饱饱的肚子开了三枪，随即便开车跑了。”","‘Sure he went,’—Mr. Wolfshiem’s nose flashed at me in-dignantly—’He turned around in the door and says, ‘Don’t let that waiter take away my coffee!’Then he went out on the sidewalk and they shot him three times in his full belly and drove away.’"
"“他们其中四个都坐电椅了。”我想了起来，便说道，","‘Four of them were electrocuted,’ I said, remembering."
"“五个，还有贝克尔。”他将鼻孔朝向我，似乎对我很感兴趣：“我知道你正在找关系做生意。”","‘Five with Becker.’His nostrils turned to me in an interested way.‘I understand you’re looking for a business gonnegtion.’"
"他的这两个话题的转换还真让人大吃一惊。盖茨比替我回答说：","The juxtaposition of these two remarks was startling.Gatsby answered for me:"
"“哦，不是，”他大声说，“这不是那个人。”“不是啊？”沃尔夫山姆先生似乎很失望。“这只是一个朋友。我跟你说过我们改天再谈那件事的嘛。”","‘Oh, no,’ he exclaimed, ‘this isn’t the man!’‘No?’Mr. Wolfshiem seemed disappointed.‘This is just a friend.I told you we’d talk about that some other time.’"
"“不好意思，”沃尔夫山姆先生说，“我认错人了。”","‘I beg your pardon,’ said Mr. Wolfshiem, ‘I had a wrong man.’"
"一盘鲜嫩的肉丁端了过来，沃尔夫山姆先生似乎已经忘掉了旧时大都会的那种伤感的场面，开始大肆享受美味佳肴。同时，他的双眼慢慢地转来转去，打量着整个屋子——他又转身审视了一下背后的人，完完整整地把餐厅看了一圈。我觉得，如果不是我在场，他肯定会连饭桌下也要瞅几眼。","A succulent hash arrived, and Mr. Wolfshiem, forgetting the more sentimental atmosphere of the old Metropole, began to eat with ferocious delicacy.His eyes, meanwhile, roved very slowly all around the room—he completed the arc by turning to inspect the people directly behind.I think that, except for my presence, he would have taken one short glance beneath our own table."
"“我说，老兄，”盖茨比将身子倾向我这边说道，“恐怕早上在车子里我惹你生气了吧。”","‘Look here, old sport,’ said Gatsby, leaning toward me, ‘I’m afraid I made you a little angry this morning in the car.’"
"他的脸上再次浮现出那种微笑，但这次我无动于衷。","There was the smile again, but this time I held out against it."
"“我不喜欢搞神秘。”我回答说，“我不明白为什么你不能直接说出来，告诉我你想要什么。为什么一切都要通过贝克小姐呢？”","‘I don’t like mysteries,’ I answered.‘And I don’t understand why you won’t come out frankly and tell me what you want.Why has it all got to come through Miss Baker?’"
"“哦，没有什么秘密。”他向我保证说，“你也知道，贝克小姐是一名优秀的运动员，她是不会做什么不正当的事的。”","‘Oh, it’s nothing underhand,’ he assured me.‘Miss Baker’s a great sportswoman, you know, and she’d never do anything that wasn’t all right.’"
"突然他看了看表，跳起来就匆匆走出餐厅去了，餐桌旁只剩下我和沃尔夫山姆先生。","Suddenly he looked at his watch, jumped up and hurried from the room leaving me with Mr. Wolfshiem at the table."
"“他得去打电话。”沃尔夫山姆先生一边目送他出去，一边对我说，“好人啊，是吧？长得帅，又非常绅士。”","‘He has to telephone,’ said Mr. Wolfshiem, following him with his eyes.‘Fine fellow, isn’t he?Handsome to look at and a perfect gentleman.’"
"“是的。”","‘Yes.’"
"“他是牛津大学毕业的。”","‘He’s an Oggsford man.’"
"“哦！”“他在英国牛津大学读书。你知道牛津大学不？”“我听说过。”","‘Oh!’‘He went to Oggsford College in England.You know Oggsford College?’‘I’ve heard of it.’"
"“那是世界最有名的学府之一。”","‘It’s one of the most famous colleges in the world.’"
"“你认识盖茨比时间长吗？”我问道。","‘Have you known Gatsby for a long time?’I inquired."
"“有几年了。”他带着一种无比满足的表情回答道，“战争刚刚结束，我便有幸认识了他。可是和他只交谈了一个小时，我就发现自己认识了一个非常有修养的人。我对自己说：‘这个男人就是那种让你非常乐意带回家去介绍给妈妈和妹妹认识的人。’”他顿了一下：“我知道你在看我袖口上的纽扣。”","‘Several years,’ he answered in a gratified way.‘I made the pleasure of his acquaintance just after the war.But I knew I had discovered a man of fine breeding after I talked with him an hour.I said to myself: ‘There’s the kind of man you’d like to take home and introduce to your mother and sister.’He paused.‘I see you’re looking at my cuff buttons.’"
"我本来并没有看，可现在倒真的看了看。这些扣子是用小象牙片制成的，看起来怪怪的，却又很熟悉。","I hadn’t been looking at them, but I did now.They were composed of oddly familiar pieces of ivory."
"“这是精选出来的人的臼齿做的。”他告诉我。","‘Finest specimens of human molars,’ he informed me."
"“真的！”我仔细瞅了瞅，“这个想法真是太妙了。”","‘Well!’I inspected them.‘That’s a very interesting idea.’"
"“是啊。”他将袖口轻轻缩回到了外套里面，“是啊，盖茨比在对待女人方面非常谨慎。朋友的妻子他从来都不会多看一眼。”","‘Yeah.’He flipped his sleeves up under his coat.‘Yeah, Gatsby’s very careful about women.He would never so much as look at a friend’s wife.’"
"当这位凭直觉而受到信赖的对象回到饭桌边坐下时，沃尔夫山姆先生猛地一口喝完杯里的咖啡，然后站了起来。","When the subject of this instinctive trust returned to the table and sat down Mr. Wolfshiem drank his coffee with a jerk and got to his feet."
"“我午餐吃得非常开心，”他说，“我得赶快走啦，否则一会儿你们两个年轻人就要嫌我不知趣喽。”","‘I have enjoyed my lunch,’ he said, ‘and I’m going to run off from you two young men before I outstay my welcome.’"
"“别急，迈耶。”盖茨比毫无热情地说。沃尔夫山姆先生举起手做了一个祝福的动作。","‘Don’t hurry, Meyer,’ said Gatsby, without enthusiasm.Mr. Wolfshiem raised his hand in a sort of benediction."
"“你们很文雅，不过我已经是另一辈的人了。”他庄严地说道，“你们坐在这儿聊聊你们喜欢的运动，你们的女朋友，还有你们的……”他说着将手一挥，示意以下内容可以自己想象，“至于我，已经是五十岁的人了，就不再打扰你们了。”","‘You’re very polite but I belong to another generation,’ he announced solemnly.‘You sit here and discuss your sports and your young ladies and your—’ He supplied an imaginary noun with another wave of his hand—‘As for me, I am fifty years old, and I won’t impose myself on you any longer.’"
"他和我们握过手转身离去的时候，他那伤感的鼻子又在抖动了。我在想是不是自己说了什么话冒犯了他。","As he shook hands and turned away his tragic nose was trembling.I wondered if I had said anything to offend him."
"“他有时候会变得非常伤感。”盖茨比先生解释道，“今天又是他的一个伤感日。他在纽约也是个人物——百老汇的常客。”","‘He becomes very sentimental sometimes,’ explained Gatsby.‘This is one of his sentimental days.He’s quite a character around New York—a denizen of Broadway.’"
"“他究竟是什么人，演员吗？”","‘Who is he anyhow—an actor?’"
"“不是。”","‘No.’"
"“牙科医生吗？”","‘A dentist?’"
"“迈耶·沃尔夫山姆？不是，他是个赌徒。”盖茨比迟疑了一下，然后很冷静地补充说，“他是1919年幕后操纵世界棒球联赛的那个人。”","‘Meyer Wolfshiem?No, he’s a gambler.’Gatsby hesitated, then added coolly: ‘He’s the man who fixed the World’s Series back in 1919.’"
"“幕后操纵世界棒球联赛？”我重复了一遍。","‘Fixed the World’s Series?’I repeated."
"这个消息让我瞠目结舌。我当然记得1919年世界棒球联赛被人幕后操纵的事，只是即便我想到过这件事情，我也只是将其当成一桩旧事儿，一个由一连串不可避免的事件导致的结果。我从来没有想过一个人居然可以将五千万人愚弄——正如一个盗贼单枪匹马便成功撬获一个保险柜一般。","The idea staggered me.I remembered of course that the World’s Series had been fixed in 1919 but if I had thought of it at all I would have thought of it as a thing that merely HAPPENED, the end of some inevitable chain.It never occurred to me that one man could start to play with the faith of fifty million people—with the single-mindedness of a burglar blowing a safe."
"“他是如何做到的呢？”过了一会儿我问道。","‘How did he happen to do that?’I asked after a minute."
"“他只是瞅准了机会。”","‘He just saw the opportunity.’"
"“他为什么没有坐牢呢？”","‘Why isn’t he in jail?’"
"“他们抓不住他，老兄。他可是非常聪明的。”","‘They can’t get him, old sport.He’s a smart man.’"
"我抢着去买了单。服务员把找的钱拿给我时，我看到汤姆·布坎南在这个拥挤房间的对面。","I insisted on paying the check.As the waiter brought my change I caught sight of Tom Buchanan across the crowded room."
"“跟我过来一下。”我说，“我要过去和一个人打声招呼。”","‘Come along with me for a minute,’ I said.‘I’ve got to say hello to someone.’"
"汤姆一看到我们便跳了起来，还朝我们这边走了五六步。","When he saw us Tom jumped up and took half a dozen steps in our direction."
"“你最近去哪儿啦？”他热切地询问道，“因为你没打电话过来，黛西都气疯了。”","‘Where’ve you been?’ he demanded eagerly.‘Daisy’s furious because you haven’t called up.’"
"“这位是盖茨比先生，这位是布坎南先生。”","‘This is Mr. Gatsby, Mr. Buchanan.’"
"他们简单地握了一下手，盖茨比表情很不自然，脸上流露出一种少有的局促不安。","They shook hands briefly and a strained, unfamiliar look of embarrassment came over Gatsby’s face."
"“你近来到底怎么样？”汤姆问我，“你怎么会跑这么远来这儿吃饭呢？”","‘How’ve you been, anyhow?’ demanded Tom of me.‘How’d you happen to come up this far to eat?’"
"“我刚和盖茨比先生一起吃的午餐。”","‘I’ve been having lunch with Mr. Gatsby.’"
"我转身看盖茨比先生，但是他已经不见了。","I turned toward Mr. Gatsby, but he was no longer there."
"1917年十月里的一天——","One October day in nineteen-seventeen—"
"（那天下午，乔丹·贝克挺直地坐在广场酒店茶室里的一张靠背笔直的椅子上，向我说起了往事。）——那天我正从一个地方步行去另外一个地方，一只脚走在人行道上，一只脚走在草坪上。我更喜欢在草坪上走，因为我穿着一双刚从英国买回来的鞋子，鞋底的橡胶粒踏在软绵绵的草坪上，留下一行行印痕。我还穿着一条新的方格子花呢裙，每当裙子在风中微微飘动的时候，各家各户门前的红、白、蓝三色旗帜就都舒展挺直，不以为然地发出“啧——啧——啧”的响声。","(said Jordan Baker that afternoon, sitting up very straight on a straight chair in the tea-garden at the Plaza Hotel)—I was walking along from one place to another half on the sidewalks and half on the lawns.I was happier on the lawns because I had on shoes from England with rubber nobs on the soles that bit into the soft ground.I had on a new plaid skirt also that blew a little in the wind and whenever this happened the red, white and blue banners in front of all the houses stretched out stiff and said TUT-TUT-TUT-TUT in a disapproving way."
"最大的旗帜和最大的草坪都是黛西·费伊家的。她只有十八岁，比我大两岁，而且是路易斯维尔所有年轻女孩中最受欢迎的一个。她穿着白色的裙子，开着一辆白色的敞篷跑车，家里的电话一天到晚响个不停，泰勒营里的军官总是非常激动地邀请她晚上单独约会，“不管怎样，就一个小时吧！”","The largest of the banners and the largest of the lawns belonged to Daisy Fay’s house.She was just eighteen, two years older than me, and by far the most popular of all the young girls in Louisville.She dressed in white, and had a little white roadster and all day long the telephone rang in her house and excited young officers from Camp Tay—lor demanded the privilege of monopolizing her that night, ‘anyways, for an hour!’"
"那天早上，我经过她家房子对面的时候，她的白色跑车就停在路边，而她和一个我从来都没有见过的中尉一起坐在车上。他们非常专注于对方，我走到离他们五英尺距离的时候，她才看到我。","When I came opposite her house that morning her white roadster was beside the curb, and she was sitting in it with a lieutenant I had never seen before.They were so engrossed in each other that she didn’t see me until I was five feet away."
"“你好，乔丹。”她出其不意地和我打了声招呼，“请过来一下。”","‘Hello Jordan,’ she called unexpectedly.‘Please come here.’"
"她要和我说话，这让我倍感荣幸，因为在所有比我年龄大的女孩中，我最羡慕的就是她。她问我是否要去红十字会做绷带。我说是的。接着，她问我能否帮她捎口信，说那天她不能去了。黛西说话的时候，那个军官看着她，那种眼神是每一个年轻女孩都期待得到的。因为那一刻让我觉得如此地浪漫，所以我至今一直记得。他的名字叫杰伊·盖茨比，而且从那以后四年多，我一直没有见到过他——就连我上次在长岛碰到他后，都没有意识到是同一个人。","I was flattered that she wanted to speak to me, because of all the older girls I admired her most.She asked me if I was going to the Red Cross and make bandages.I was.Well, then, would I tell them that she couldn’t come that day?The officer looked at Daisy while she was speaking, in a way that every young girl wants to be looked at sometime, and because it seemed romantic to me I have remembered the incident ever since.His name was Jay Gatsby and I didn’t lay eyes on him again for over four years—even after I’d met him on Long Island I didn’t realize it was the same man."
"那是1917年。到了第二年，我自己也有了几个追求者，同时我又开始参加了联赛，所以我不怎么见到黛西。她交往的是一帮比我年纪稍大一点的朋友——如果她还在和一些人交往的话。关于她的流言在到处传播——说什么一个冬日的晚上，她母亲发现她正在收拾行囊，准备去纽约同一个要出国的军人道别。她被拦了下来，但是有好几个星期都不愿意同家里人讲话。从此以后她不再同军人交往了，只是同城里的几个根本无法参军的平脚板、近视眼的年轻人来往。","That was nineteen-seventeen.By the next year I had a few beaux myself, and I began to play in tournaments, so I didn’t see Daisy very often.She went with a slightly older crowd—when she went with anyone at all.Wild rumors were circulating about her—how her mother had found her packing her bag one winter night to go to New York and say goodbye to a soldier who was going overseas.She was effectually prevented, but she wasn’t on speaking terms with her family for several weeks.After that she didn’t play around with the soldiers any more but only with a few flat-footed, short-sighted young men in town who couldn’t get into the army at all."
"到了次年的秋天，她再次快乐起来，和以前一样的快乐。停战后，她举办了首次社交舞会，大概在二月份，她同一个来自新奥尔良的男的订了婚。六月份她嫁给了来自芝加哥的汤姆·布坎南，婚礼的奢华隆重在路易斯维尔是前所未有的。新郎带了一百多人并包了四节车厢前来，并且将赛尔巴赫酒店的整整一层都包下来了。在婚礼的前一天他还送给她一串价值三十五万美元的珍珠项链。","By the next autumn she was gay again, gay as ever.She had a debut after the Armistice, and in February she was presumably engaged to a man from New Orleans.In June she married Tom Buchanan of Chicago with more pomp and circumstance than Louisville ever knew before.He came down with a hundred people in four private cars and hired a whole floor of the Seelbach Hotel, and the day before the wedding he gave her a string of pearls valued at three hundred and fifty thousand dollars."
"我是她的伴娘。我在婚宴开始前半个小时来到她的房间，发现她躺在床上，穿着一件绣花裙，看上去如同六月的夜晚那么漂亮——但是却醉得像一只猴子一般。她一只手拿着一瓶白葡萄酒，另一只手拿着一封信。","I was bridesmaid.I came into her room half an hour before the bridal dinner, and found her lying on her bed as lovely as the June night in her flowered dress—and as drunk as a monkey.She had a bottle of sauterne in one hand and a letter in the other."
"“恭喜我。”她咕哝着说，“从来都没喝过酒，啊，我真是喜欢喝酒啊。”","‘ ‘Gratulate me,’ she muttered.‘Never had a drink before but oh, how I do enjoy it.’"
"“怎么了，黛西？”","‘What’s the matter, Daisy?’"
"我被吓到了，实话说，我以前从来没有见过一个女孩子醉成那样。","I was scared, I can tell you; I’d never seen a girl like that before."
"“给你，亲爱的。”她将废纸篓拿在床上，在里面摸索了一会儿，掏出了那串珍珠项链，“把这个拿到楼下去，是谁的就还给谁。告诉他们说黛西改变主意了。就说‘黛西改变主意了！’”","‘Here, dearis.’She groped around in a waste-basket she had with her on the bed and pulled out the string of pearls.‘Take ‘em downstairs and give ‘em back to whoever they belong to.Tell ‘em all Daisy’s change’ her mine.Say ‘Daisy’s change’ her mine!’.’"
"她开始哭起来——一直哭啊哭。我冲出去找到了她妈妈的女佣，然后我们一起将门锁上，把她拖去洗了个冷水澡。她紧紧地捏着那封信不放手。她捏着信进了浴盆，并将其捏成了一个湿漉漉的纸团，最后直到她看到那封信碎得如同雪花一般时，才让我把它放在肥皂碟里边。","She began to cry—she cried and cried.I rushed out and found her mother’s maid and we locked the door and got her into a cold bath.She wouldn’t let go of the letter.She took it into the tub with her and squeezed it up into a wet ball, and only let me leave it in the soap dish when she saw that it was coming to pieces like snow."
"但是她一句话也没说。我们让她闻了闻阿摩尼亚精油，又用冰块敷了一下她的额头，然后哄她把衣服穿上。半个小时后，我们走出了房间，那串珍珠项链戴在了她的脖子上，一场风波就这样过去了。次日下午五点，她像是什么都没有发生过一样嫁给了汤姆·布坎南，然后起程去南太平洋开始了长达三个月的蜜月之旅。","But she didn’t say another word.We gave her spirits of ammonia and put ice on her forehead and hooked her back into her dress and half an hour later when we walked out of the room the pearls were around her neck and the incident was over.Next day at five o’clock she married Tom Buchanan without so much as a shiver and started off on a three months’ trip to the South Seas."
"他们回来后我在圣巴巴拉遇到了他们，我从来没有见过哪个女孩会如此迷恋自己的丈夫。如果他离开房间一会儿，她也会心神不定地四处张望着问：“汤姆哪儿去了？”同时脸上露出一副心不在焉的表情，直到看到他从门口走进来。她经常坐在沙滩上，把他的头放在自己的怀里，用手轻轻抚摸着他的眼睛，喜悦无比地望着他，一坐就是个把小时。看着他们在一起的时候，你会觉得无比感动——那情景会让你无限向往，同时又会轻轻一笑。那是八月的事情了。我离开圣巴巴拉后的一个星期，一天晚上汤姆开车在文图拉公路上与一辆货车相撞，他的车被撞掉了一只前轮。与他一同在车上的那个女孩也被登上了报纸，因为她的一个胳膊被撞断了——她是圣巴巴拉酒店清理房间的女服务员。","I saw them in Santa Barbara when they came back and I thought I’d never seen a girl so mad about her husband.If he left the room for a minute she’d look around uneasily and say ‘Where’s Tom gone?’ and wear the most abstracted expression until she saw him coming in the door.She used to sit on the sand with his head in her lap by the hour rubbing her fingers over his eyes and looking at him with unfathomable delight.It was touching to see them together—it made you laugh in a hushed, fascinated way.That was in August.A week after I left Santa Barbara Tom ran into a wagon on the Ventura road one night and ripped a front wheel off his car.The girl who was with him got into the papers too because her arm was broken—she was one of the chambermaids in the Santa Barbara Hotel."
"第二年的四月份，黛西生了她的小女儿，他们去法国呆了一年。有一年春天我在戛纳看到过他们，后来在多维尔又见过一次，然后她们就回到芝加哥定居下来了。你也知道，黛西在芝加哥可是很有名气的。和他们交往的一帮人个个都是年轻富有而又放荡不羁，但是她的名声却始终是清清白白的。也许是因为她不喝酒的缘故吧。在一帮嗜酒成性的人中能做到滴酒不沾，那可真的是一大优势。你可以保持沉默，也可以趁机搞点小动作。别的人都遮蔽了眼睛，看不到也不在意这些。也许黛西从来没搞过什么风流之事——但是她的声音里却有着一种特别的东西……","The next April Daisy had her little girl and they went to France for a year.I saw them one spring in Cannes and later in Deauville and then they came back to Chicago to settle down.Daisy was popular in Chicago, as you know.They moved with a fast crowd, all of them young and rich and wild, but she came out with an absolutely perfect reputation.Perhaps because she doesn’t drink.It’s a great advantage not to drink among hard-drinking people.You can hold your tongue and, moreover, you can time any little irregularity of your own so that everybody else is so blind that they don’t see or care.Perhaps Daisy never went in for amour at all—and yet there’s something in that voice of hers...."
"后来，大约是六个星期之前，她这么多年来第一次听到盖茨比的名字。就是那次我问你的时候——你还记得不——你认不认识西卵的盖茨比。你回家之后，她来到我的房间叫醒我，问道：“哪个盖茨比啊？”我将他描述了一番——那时我还半睡半醒——她听后却用非常奇怪的声音说，那一定是她曾经相识的那个男人。直到那时我才明白原来盖茨比就是当年坐在她白色跑车里的那个军官。","Well, about six weeks ago, she heard the name Gatsby for the first time in years.It was when I asked you—do you remember?—if you knew Gatsby in West Egg.After you had gone home she came into my room and woke me up, and said ‘What Gatsby?’ and when I described him—I was half asleep—she said in the strangest voice that it must be the man she used to know.It wasn’t until then that I connected this Gatsby with the officer in her white car."
"乔丹·贝克讲完所有这些之时，我们已经离开广场酒店半个小时了，此刻正坐着敞篷马车穿过中央公园。太阳已经在西城五十几号街明星们居住的公寓后面落下，小女孩们像蟋蟀一般聚集在草地上，她们清亮的嗓音在闷热的暮色中响起：","When Jordan Baker had finished telling all this we had left the Plaza for half an hour and were driving in a Victoria through Central Park.The sun had gone down behind the tall apartments of the movie stars in the West Fifties and the clear voices of girls, already gathered like crickets on the grass, rose through the hot twilight:"
"“我是阿拉伯的酋长，你的爱属于我。深夜，当你酣然入睡，我爬入你的帐篷——”","‘I’m the Sheik of Araby, Your love belongs to me.At night when you’re are asleep, Into your tent I’ll creep—’"
"“这是一种很奇怪的巧合。”我说道，“但这根本就不是什么巧合。”“为什么不是呢？”","‘It was a strange coincidence,’ I said.‘But it wasn’t a coincidence at all.’‘Why not?’"
"“盖茨比买了那套房子，就是因为黛西住在海湾的对面。”","‘Gatsby bought that house so that Daisy would be just across the bay.’"
"这样看来，那个六月的晚上他所翘首仰望的并不仅仅是那满天的星斗。盖茨比在我的眼中有了生命，似乎他突然从那种漫无目的的奢华中脱胎而出一般。","Then it had not been merely the stars to which he had aspired on that June night.He came alive to me, delivered suddenly from the womb of his purposeless splendor."
"“他想知道——”乔丹继续说道，“你是否愿意哪天下午把黛西邀请到你家，然后让他也过去。”","‘He wants to know—’ continued Jordan ‘—if you’ll invite Daisy to your house some afternoon and then let him come over.’"
"这个朴实的要求让我倍感震惊。他等了五年，买了一栋别墅，与来来往往的飞蛾分享着这里的星光，只是为了在某天下午能够到一个陌生人的花园“去一下”。","The modesty of the demand shook me.He had waited five years and bought a mansion where he dispensed starlight to casual moths so that he could ‘come over’ some afternoon to a stranger’s garden."
"“他就提了这么一个小小的要求，有必要告诉我这一切吗？”","‘Did I have to know all this before he could ask such a little thing?’"
"“他很担心。他等了这么久了。他觉得可能会冒犯你。你知道，即便如此，他还是内心很顽强的人。＂","‘He’s afraid.He’s waited so long.He thought you might be offended.You see he’s a regular tough underneath it all.’"
"我还是有点担心。","Something worried me."
"“他为什么不请你来安排见面呢？”","‘Why didn’t he ask you to arrange a meeting?’"
"“他想让她看看他的房子。”她解释说道，“而你的房子正好在他隔壁。”","‘He wants her to see his house,’ she explained.‘And your house is right next door.’"
"“哦！”","‘Oh!’"
"“我觉得他还是有点期待她哪天晚上能翩然而至，来参加他的宴会，”乔丹继续说道，“但是她从来都没去过。然后他开始随便向大家打听，问他们是否认识她，而我就是他找到的第一个人。就是在舞会上他派人过去请我的那天晚上，你真的应该在场听听他是如何费尽心思地转入正题的。当然了，我马上建议在纽约一起吃午餐——而他则像是疯了一样：‘我不会做任何出格的事情！’他一直说着，‘我只想在隔壁见见她。’”","‘I think he half expected her to wander into one of his parties, some night,’ went on Jordan, ‘but she never did.Then he began asking people casually if they knew her, and I was the first one he found.It was that night he sent for me at his dance, and you should have heard the elaborate way he worked up to it.Of course, I immediately suggested a luncheon in New York—and I thought he’d go mad: ‘ ‘I don’t want to do anything out of the way!’ he kept saying.‘I want to see her right next door.’"
"“当我告诉他你是汤姆一个很要好的朋友时，他有些动摇，想放弃整个计划。他不是很了解汤姆，虽然他说自己已经连续读了一年的一份芝加哥日报，只是为了碰巧能看一眼黛西的名字。”","‘When I said you were a particular friend of Tom’s he started to abandon the whole idea.He doesn’t know very much about Tom, though he says he’s read a Chicago paper for years just on the chance of catching a glimpse of Daisy’s name.’"
"此时天色已经黑了，马车走到小桥下的时候，我伸出胳膊搂住了乔丹那金色的肩膀，然后将她拉到我的身边，邀请她一起吃晚饭。瞬间，我想的不再是黛西和盖茨比的事了，而是这个干净、结实、有点笨笨的女人，她总是对一切充满着怀疑，而此刻她却开心地依偎在我的臂弯里。此刻，一句名言在我的耳畔响起，让我顿感兴奋不已：“人世芸芸众生，不是被人追求，就是在追求别人，不是忙忙碌碌，就是疲惫不堪。”","It was dark now, and as we dipped under a little bridge I put my arm around Jordan’s golden shoulder and drew her toward me and asked her to dinner.Suddenly I wasn’t thinking of Daisy and Gatsby any more but of this clean, hard, limited person who dealt in universal skepticism and who leaned back jauntily just within the circle of my arm.A phrase began to beat in my ears with a sort of heady excitement: ‘There are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy and the tired.’"
"“黛西的生活也应该得到点什么。”乔丹轻轻的对我说。","‘And Daisy ought to have something in her life,’ murmured Jordan to me."
"“她想见盖茨比吗？”","‘Does she want to see Gatsby?’"
"“她还不知道这件事情。盖茨比不想让她知道。你只管请她来喝茶就可以了。”","‘She’s not to know about it.Gatsby doesn’t want her to know.You’re just supposed to invite her to tea.’"
"我们经过一排黑黢黢的树木，然后在五十九号街道正面一片微弱而柔和的灯光的照耀下，走进了公园。与盖茨比和汤姆·布坎南不同的是，我没有情人，自然眼前也不会有哪位女孩的面孔浮现在黑暗的檐口或是炫目的广告牌上，于是我将身边的这个女孩拉得更近一些，紧紧地搂在怀里。她那苍白而有些傲慢的嘴唇露出了笑容。于是我再一次将她拉近，这次我的脸靠她更近了。","We passed a barrier of dark trees, and then the facade of Fifty-ninth Street, a block of delicate pale light, beamed down into the park.Unlike Gatsby and Tom Buchanan I had no girl whose disembodied face floated along the dark cornices and blinding signs and so I drew up the girl beside me, tightening my arms.Her wan, scornful mouth smiled and so I drew her up again, closer, this time to my face."
"第五章","Chapter 5"
"那天晚上回西卵的时候，有一小会儿我担心自己的房子着火了。凌晨两点钟的时候，半岛的整个一角灯火辉煌，灯光落在灌木丛上显得虚无缥缈，同时照到路旁的电线杆上，映出一条条长长的亮光。转弯之后，我才发现原来是盖茨比的别墅，从塔楼到地窖都灯火通明。","When I came home to West Egg that night I was afraid for a moment that my house was on fire.Two o’clock and the whole corner of the peninsula was blazing with light which fell unreal on the shrubbery and made thin elongating glints upon the roadside wires.Turning a corner I saw that it was Gatsby’s house, lit from tower to cellar."
"起初我还以为又是一次晚会，一个狂欢盛会，整个别墅所有房间都统统开放，让大家一起玩“捉迷藏”或“罐头沙丁鱼”。但是却听不到一点声音。只有树丛里的一阵阵风吹动着电线，弄得灯光时明时暗，仿佛整栋别墅在对着黑暗眨眼睛。当我乘坐的出租车呻吟着开走后，我看到盖茨比正穿过他的草坪，向我走过来。“你的房子看上去仿佛在开世界博览会一般。”我说道。“是吗？”他心不在焉地转头过去看了一眼，“我刚进几间房里随便看了看。我们去科尼岛玩吧，老兄。坐我的车去。”“现在太晚了吧。”","At first I thought it was another party, a wild rout that had resolved itself into ‘hide-and-go-seek’ or ‘sardines-in-the-box’ with all the house thrown open to the game.But there wasn’t a sound.Only wind in the trees which blew the wires and made the lights go off and on again as if the house had winked into the darkness.As my taxi groaned away I saw Gatsby walking toward me across his lawn.‘Your place looks like the world’s fair,’ I said.‘Does it?’He turned his eyes toward it absently.‘I have been glancing into some of the rooms.Let’s go to Coney Island, old sport.In my car.’‘It’s too late.’"
"“那么，我们一起跳进游泳池去吧，怎么样？我整个夏天都没有用过呢。”“我得去休息了。”","‘Well, suppose we take a plunge in the swimming pool?I haven’t made use of it all summer.’‘I’ve got to go to bed.’"
"“好吧。”","‘All right.’"
"他等在那儿，看着我，竭力抑制着自己急切的心情。“我和贝克小姐已经谈过了。”过了一会儿，我说道，“我明天会给黛西打电话，邀请她过来喝茶。”","He waited, looking at me with suppressed eagerness.‘I talked with Miss Baker,’ I said after a moment.‘I’m going to call up Daisy tomorrow and invite her over here to tea.’"
"“哦，那好吧。”他漫不经心地说道，“我不想给您增添任何麻烦。”","‘Oh, that’s all right,’ he said carelessly.‘I don’t want to put you to any trouble.’"
"“你看哪天合适呢？”","‘What day would suit you?’"
"“您看哪天合适呢？”他赶快把我的话纠正了过来，“我不想给您增添任何麻烦，您也知道。”","‘What day would suit YOU?’ he corrected me quickly.‘I don’t want to put you to any trouble, you see.’"
"“后天怎么样呢？”他想了一会儿。然后，他勉强说道：","‘How about the day after tomorrow?’He considered for a moment.Then, with reluctance:"
"“我想找人修剪一下草坪。”","‘I want to get the grass cut,’ he said."
"我们俩同时低头看了看草坪——我的这块参差不齐的草地和他的那块修剪整齐、郁郁葱葱的草坪之间有一条明显的分界线。我猜想他指的是我的这块草地。","We both looked at the grass—there was a sharp line where my ragged lawn ended and the darker, well-kept expanse of his began.I suspected that he meant my grass."
"“另外还有件小事。”他吞吞吐吐地，有些犹豫不定。","‘There’s another little thing,’ he said uncertainly, and hesitated."
"“你是想推迟几天吗？”我问道。","‘Would you rather put it off for a few days?’I asked."
"“哦，和那个没关系。至少——”　他支支吾吾地开了一连串的头，“噢，我觉得……嘿，我说，老兄，你赚钱并不多，是不？”","‘Oh, it isn’t about that.At least—’ He fumbled with a series of beginnings.‘Why, I thought—why, look here, old sport, you don’t make much money, do you?’"
"“不是很多。”","‘Not very much.’"
"这句话似乎让他放下了心，他信心十足地说道：","This seemed to reassure him and he continued more confidently."
"“我猜你就赚得不多，你要是不介意的话——你知道，我附带着做些小生意，就是点副业，你也明白。我在想既然你赚得不是很多的话——你在推销债券，是吧，老兄？”","‘I thought you didn’t, if you’ll pardon my—you see, I carry on a little business on the side, a sort of sideline, you understand.And I thought that if you don’t make very much—You’re selling bonds, aren’t you, old sport?’"
"“尝试着干。”","‘Trying to.’"
"“那么，你可能对这个感兴趣。你不需要花费太多的时间，却可能拥有一笔可观的收入。碰巧这也是非常机密的。","‘Well, this would interest you.It wouldn’t take up much of your time and you might pick up a nice bit of money.It happens to be a rather confidential sort of thing.’"
"现在，我才意识到若不是当时那种情况，那次谈话可能会是我人生的一个转折点。但是，由于他的提议既直白又唐突，分明是为了酬谢我的帮助，我别无其他选择，只能当场打断他的话。","I realize now that under different circumstances that conversation might have been one of the crises of my life.But, because the offer was obviously and tactlessly for a service to be rendered, I had no choice except to cut him off there."
"“我手头上已经有很多事情要做。”我说，“非常感谢你，但是我实在是干不了更多的工作了。”","‘I’ve got my hands full,’ I said.‘I’m much obliged but I couldn’t take on any more work.’"
"“你不需要和沃尔夫山姆有任何的交往。”显然他认为我在回避午餐时提到的“关系”，但是我告诉他并不是这样的。他又等了一会儿，希望我能找个话题来聊，可是我的心思并不在这上面，也没有搭理他，于是他只好不情愿地回家去了。","‘You wouldn’t have to do any business with Wolfshiem.’Evidently he thought that I was shying away from the ‘gon-negtion’ mentioned at lunch, but I assured him he was wrong.He waited a moment longer, hoping I’d begin a conversation, but I was too absorbed to be responsive, so he went unwillingly home."
"那天晚上我很开心，感觉整个身体轻飘飘地，我觉得自己可能一进门就倒头睡着了。因此我也不知道盖茨比是否去了科尼岛，也不知道他在那灯火通明的别墅里花了几个小时“随便看看房间”。第二天早上我在办公室里给黛西打了个电话，邀请她来我家喝茶。","The evening had made me light-headed and happy; I think I walked into a deep sleep as I entered my front door.So I didn’t know whether or not Gatsby went to Coney Island or for how many hours he ‘glanced into rooms’ while his house blazed gaudily on.I called up Daisy from the office next morning and invited her to come to tea."
"“别带汤姆来。”我提醒她说。","‘Don’t bring Tom,’ I warned her."
"“什么？”","‘What?’"
"“别带汤姆来。”","‘Don’t bring Tom.’"
"“汤姆’是谁啊？”她故意装糊涂地问。","‘Who is ‘Tom’?’ she asked innocently."
"我们约的那天下起了倾盆大雨。上午十一点的时候，一个男的穿着雨衣，拖着一台割草机，敲开我的门，说盖茨比先生派他来修剪我的草地。这倒让我想起自己忘了告诉芬兰女佣回来帮忙。于是我开车去西卵村，沿着两边都是白灰墙的湿漉漉的巷子找她，同时还买了些茶杯、柠檬还有鲜花。","The day agreed upon was pouring rain.At eleven o’clock a man in a raincoat dragging a lawn-mower tapped at my front door and said that Mr. Gatsby had sent him over to cut my grass.This reminded me that I had forgotten to tell my Finn to come back so I drove into West Egg Village to search for her among soggy white-washed alleys and to buy some cups and lemons and flowers."
"鲜花其实是多余的，因为下午两点的时候，从盖茨比家送来了一温室的鲜花，还有数不清的插花容器。一个小时后，前门被人小心翼翼地推开了。盖茨比身着白色法兰绒西装、银色的衬衫、金色的领带，匆匆忙忙地走了进来。他脸色苍白，眼袋发黑，明显是彻夜未眠。","The flowers were unnecessary, for at two o’clock a greenhouse arrived from Gatsby’s, with innumerable receptacles to contain it.An hour later the front door opened nervously, and Gatsby in a white flannel suit, silver shirt and gold-colored tie hurried in.He was pale and there were dark signs of sleeplessness beneath his eyes."
"“一切都准备好了吗？”他进门便问道。","‘Is everything all right?’ he asked immediately."
"“如果你是说草地的话，草地看上去很漂亮。”","‘The grass looks fine, if that’s what you mean.’"
"“什么草地？”他一脸茫然地问道。“哦，院子里的草地。”他向窗外望了望草地，但是从他的表情我看得出，其实他根本什么都没看见。","‘What grass?’ he inquired blankly.‘Oh, the grass in the yard.’He looked out the window at it, but judging from his expression I don’t believe he saw a thing."
"“看上去不错。”他含含糊糊地说，“有一家报纸报道说雨在四点左右会停。好像就是《纽约时报》吧。喝——喝茶所需的东西都准备齐全了吗？”","‘Looks very good,’ he remarked vaguely.‘One of the papers said they thought the rain would stop about four.I think it was ‘The Journal.’Have you got everything you need in the shape of—of tea?’"
"我带他来到食品间，他用责备的目光看了一眼芬兰女佣。我们又一起仔细检查了一番从熟食店买回来的十二块柠檬蛋糕。","I took him into the pantry where he looked a little reproachfully at the Finn.Together we scrutinized the twelve lemon cakes from the delicatessen shop."
"“这个行吗？”我问道。","‘Will they do?’I asked."
"“当然行，当然行！都很好！”他又空洞地加了一句，“老兄。”","‘Of course, of course!They’re fine!’ and he added hollowly, ‘... old sport.’"
"三点半的时候，雨渐渐小了下来，变成了蒙蒙的雾气，偶尔也会有几滴雨点像露珠一般在雾气里飘过。盖茨比神情茫然地翻阅着一本克莱的《经济学》，每当芬兰女佣的脚步轻轻震动一下厨房的地板时，他便不由得一惊，同时他还时不时地朝着模糊的窗口向外张望，似乎外边正在发生着一连串看不见却让人惊恐不已的事情。最后他站起来，用不确定的声音告诉我他要回家了。","The rain cooled about half-past three to a damp mist through which occasional thin drops swam like dew.Gatsby looked with vacant eyes through a copy of Clay’s ‘Economics,’ startling at the Finnish tread that shook the kitchen floor and peering toward the bleared windows from time to time as if a series of invisible but alarming happenings were taking place outside.Finally he got up and informed me in an uncertain voice that he was going home."
"“为什么要回去呢？”","‘Why’s that?’"
"“没人会来喝茶了。时间已经太晚了！”他看了看表，好像别处还有什么紧急的事等着他去办，“我不能在这里等一整天。”","‘Nobody’s coming to tea.It’s too late!’He looked at his watch as if there was some pressing demand on his time elsewhere.‘I can’t wait all day.’"
"“别傻了，现在差两分才四点钟。”","‘Don’t be silly; it’s just two minutes to four.’"
"他很伤心地坐了下来，仿佛是我强迫他留下来的。就在这时，我们听到外边有一辆汽车拐进了我的巷子。我们俩都跳了起来，我自己也有点担心，便冲到了院子里。","He sat down, miserably, as if I had pushed him, and simultaneously there was the sound of a motor turning into my lane.We both jumped up and, a little harrowed myself, I went out into the yard."
"一辆大型敞篷汽车朝着一颗秃秃的丁香树开了过来，树此刻还滴着水。车子停了下来。黛西戴着一顶浅紫色的三角帽子，她的脸向侧边歪了一下，笑容满面地看着我，欣喜万分。","Under the dripping bare lilac trees a large open car was coming up the drive.It stopped.Daisy’s face, tipped sideways beneath a three-cornered lavender hat, looked out at me with a bright ecstatic smile."
"“这儿就是你住的地方吗，我最亲爱的？”","‘Is this absolutely where you live, my dearest one?’"
"她那悦耳的声音在雨中听着觉得心旷神怡。我总是先倾听一会儿她那抑扬顿挫的声音，然后才听清楚她说话的内容。一缕湿漉漉的头发贴在她的脸上，仿佛涂了一笔蓝色的颜料。而当我扶她下车的时候，我看到她湿湿的手上落着一层晶莹的水珠。","The exhilarating ripple of her voice was a wild tonic in the rain.I had to follow the sound of it for a moment, up and down, with my ear alone before any words came through.A damp streak of hair lay like a dash of blue paint across her cheek and her hand was wet with glistening drops as I took it to help her from the car."
"“你是不是爱上我了？”她在我耳边低声说道，“否则怎么非得叫我单独来呢？”","‘Are you in love with me,’ she said low in my ear.‘Or why did I have to come alone?’"
"“那是雷克兰特古堡的秘密。让你的司机走的远点，一个小时后再回来。”","‘That’s the secret of Castle Rackrent.Tell your chauffeur to go far away and spend an hour.’"
"“一个小时后再来，弗蒂。”然后她又压低声音对我说：“他的名字叫弗蒂。”","‘Come back in an hour, Ferdie.’Then in a grave murmur, ‘His name is Ferdie.’"
"“他的鼻子受没受汽油味的影响啊？”“我觉得没有。”她天真地说。“为什么这样问啊？”我们进到房间里。让我大吃一惊的是客厅里空无一人。","‘Does the gasoline affect his nose?’‘I don’t think so,’ she said innocently.‘Why?’We went in.To my overwhelming surprise the living room was deserted."
"“哦，真是搞笑！”我大声说道。“什么搞笑啊？”","‘Well, that’s funny!’I exclaimed.‘What’s funny?’"
"这时大门传来了轻轻的敲门声，听上去很是斯文，于是她转过头去。我出去将门打开。只见盖茨比面色惨白，两只手像是什么重物一般插在外套的口袋里。他站在一大滩水中，眼神凄凉地瞪着我的眼睛。","She turned her head as there was a light, dignified knocking at the front door.I went out and opened it.Gatsby, pale as death, with his hands plunged like weights in his coat pockets, was standing in a puddle of water glaring tragically into my eyes."
"他昂首阔步走进门廊，两只手依旧拖在衣袋里，然后像牵线的木偶一般，猛地转了个弯，随即走进客厅不见了。那样子一点都不滑稽。我意识到自己的心在怦怦地跳个不停，外边的雨越来越大了，我伸手关上了门。","With his hands still in his coat pockets he stalked by me into the hall, turned sharply as if he were on a wire and disappeared into the living room.It wasn’t a bit funny.Aware of the loud beating of my own heart I pulled the door to against the increasing rain."
"有半分钟之久，里面没有一点声音。接着客厅里传来了哽咽着的低语声，时而夹有点笑声，紧接着就听到黛西那清晰而不自然的声音。","For half a minute there wasn’t a sound.Then from the living room I heard a sort of choking murmur and part of a laugh followed by Daisy’s voice on a clear artificial note."
"“再次见到你，我真的是万分高兴。”","‘I certainly am awfully glad to see you again.’"
"接着一阵寂静，时间长地让人害怕。我在门廊里没事可做，便走进了房间。","A pause; it endured horribly.I had nothing to do in the hall so I went into the room."
"盖茨比双手依旧放在衣袋里，斜靠在壁炉架上，非常不自然地装出一副轻松自在的样子，甚至有点像是百无聊赖。他的头后仰着靠到一台已经废弃的大台钟的钟面上，以这个姿势他用那双有些心神错乱的眼睛盯着黛西，而黛西正坐在一张硬背椅子的边上，神色慌张，姿态却很优雅。","Gatsby, his hands still in his pockets, was reclining against the mantelpiece in a strained counterfeit of perfect ease, even of boredom.His head leaned back so far that it rested against the face of a defunct mantelpiece clock and from this position his distraught eyes stared down at Daisy who was sitting frightened but graceful on the edge of a stiff chair."
"“我们以前见过面。”盖茨比咕哝了一句。他瞅了我一眼，嘴巴张开想笑却又没能笑出来。幸好那一刻，那座钟被他的头压得摇摇晃晃，他赶紧转过身用颤抖的手指将钟接住，然后扶正放好。接着他坐了下来，笔直僵硬，胳膊放在沙发扶手上，手托着下巴。","‘We’ve met before,’ muttered Gatsby.His eyes glanced momentarily at me and his lips parted with an abortive attempt at a laugh.Luckily the clock took this moment to tilt dangerously at the pressure of his head, whereupon he turned and caught it with trembling fingers and set it back in place.Then he sat down, rigidly, his elbow on the arm of the sofa and his chin in his hand."
"“对不起，刚才碰到钟了。”他说。","‘I’m sorry about the clock,’ he said."
"我的脸现在涨得火辣辣的。我的脑海里虽然有一堆的家常话，现在却一句都讲不出来。","My own face had now assumed a deep tropical burn.I couldn’t muster up a single commonplace out of the thousand in my head."
"“那是一座旧钟了。”我傻傻地对他们说。","‘It’s an old clock,’ I told them idiotically."
"我觉得那会儿我们肯定都觉得那座钟会掉到地上摔得粉碎。","I think we all believed for a moment that it had smashed in pieces on the floor."
"“我们很多年没有见面了。”黛西说道，她尽量使自己的声音自然平和。","‘We haven’t met for many years,’ said Daisy, her voice as matter-of-fact as it could ever be."
"“到十一月就整整五年了。”","‘Five years next November.’"
"盖茨比不假思索的回答又让我们愣在那里至少有一分钟。我别无他法，只好提议让他们一起来厨房帮忙准备茶，他们便都站了起来。谁知可恶的芬兰女佣却在这时候用托盘端着茶走了出来。","The automatic quality of Gatsby’s answer set us all back at least another minute.I had them both on their feet with the desperate suggestion that they help me make tea in the kitchen when the demoniac Finn brought it in on a tray."
"于是大家赶紧忙着递茶杯，拿蛋糕，在一阵忙乱中，整个气氛表面上看来还算和谐。当我和黛西聊起来的时候，盖茨比退到了一边，认真地看看这个再看看那个，神情紧张，眼神忧郁。但是这种平静的本身并不是今天喝茶的目的，于是时机一到我便找了个借口，起身来要走开。","Amid the welcome confusion of cups and cakes a certain physical decency established itself.Gatsby got himself into a shadow and while Daisy and I talked looked conscientiously from one to the other of us with tense unhappy eyes.However, as calmness wasn’t an end in itself I made an excuse at the first possible moment and got to my feet."
"“你去哪儿啊？”盖茨比立刻警觉地问道。","‘Where are you going?’ demanded Gatsby in immediate alarm."
"“我一会儿就回来。”“你走之前，我要和你说几句话。”他感情激动地跟着我来到厨房，然后关上门，神情痛苦地低声说道：“哦，天哪！”“怎么了？”","‘I’ll be back.’‘I’ve got to speak to you about something before you go.’He followed me wildly into the kitchen, closed the door and whispered: ‘Oh, God!’ in a miserable way.‘What’s the matter?’"
"“这是个严重的错误，”他边说边左右摇着头，“大错特错啊。”","‘This is a terrible mistake,’ he said, shaking his head from side to side, ‘a terrible, terrible mistake.’"
"“你只是觉得尴尬，仅此而已，”幸好我还补充了一句，“黛西也觉得尴尬。”","‘You’re just embarrassed, that’s all,’ and luckily I added: ‘Daisy’s embarrassed too.’"
"“她觉得尴尬吗？”他用怀疑的口吻重复道。","‘She’s embarrassed?’ he repeated incredulously."
"“和你一样尴尬。”","‘Just as much as you are.’"
"“别说得这么大声。”","‘Don’t talk so loud.’"
"“你怎么像个孩子似的。”我不耐烦地说道，“不仅如此，你还非常没礼貌，黛西一个人在那儿坐着呢。”","‘You’re acting like a little boy,’ I broke out impatiently.‘Not only that but you’re rude.Daisy’s sitting in there all alone.’"
"他举手示意我不要再讲了，用一种令我难以忘怀的责怪的眼神看了我一眼，随后小心翼翼地推开了门，走回那间屋子。","He raised his hand to stop my words, looked at me with unforgettable reproach and opening the door cautiously went back into the other room."
"我从后门走了出来——半个小时前盖茨比同样也是从这个门出来的，出来后他紧张不安地绕着房子转了一圈——我跑向一棵黑黝黝的满是节瘤的大树，树上枝繁叶茂，树枝相互交织在雨中构成了一块挡雨布。这时雨再次瓢泼而下，我的那块不成形的草坪，虽然被盖茨比的园丁修得整整齐齐的，现在却满是一个个小泥潭，如同史前时代的沼泽一般。蹲在树下，除了盖茨比的那座豪宅之外也没什么别的可看，于是我盯着他的房子看了足足有半个小时，就如同康德盯着他的教堂尖一般。这座房子是十年前“仿古热”初期一位酿酒商修建的，据说他曾答应为所有邻里别墅支付五年的税款，条件是各位房主同意在他们的屋顶上铺上稻草。或许是由于他们的拒绝使他“创建家业”的计划受到了致命的打击——他很快就败落了。门上依旧留着黑色花圈的时候，他的子女就将这个房子卖掉了。美国人虽然偶尔愿意去打工做农奴，可是却坚决不肯屈从做小农阶级。","I walked out the back way—just as Gatsby had when he had made his nervous circuit of the house half an hour be-fore—and ran for a huge black knotted tree whose massed leaves made a fabric against the rain.Once more it was pouring and my irregular lawn, well-shaved by Gatsby’s gardener, abounded in small muddy swamps and prehistoric marshes.There was nothing to look at from under the tree except Gatsby’s enormous house, so I stared at it, like Kant at his church steeple, for half an hour.A brewer had built it early in the ‘period’ craze, a decade before, and there was a story that he’d agreed to pay five years’ taxes on all the neighboring cottages if the owners would have their roofs thatched with straw.Perhaps their refusal took the heart out of his plan to Found a Family—he went into an immediate decline.His children sold his house with the black wreath still on the door.Americans, while occasionally willing to be serfs, have always been obstinate about being peasantry."
"半个小时后，太阳再次出来了，食品店老板开着车绕着盖茨比的汽车绕了一圈，载着他的佣人准备晚餐的各种原料驶了过来——我想他肯定一口东西都吃不下。一个女佣开始打开楼上他的房间的窗户，在每个窗户口露一下脸，然后从中间的大窗户探出身子，若有所思地朝着花园唾了一口。现在我该回去了。雨又继续下了起来，就像他们的低语声一般，时不时由于情绪的高涨而变得高亢起来。但是四周再一次变得静谧的时候，我感觉到屋里也是静悄悄的。","After half an hour the sun shone again and the grocer’s automobile rounded Gatsby’s drive with the raw material for his servants’ dinner—I felt sure he wouldn’t eat a spoonful.A maid began opening the upper windows of his house, appeared momentarily in each, and, leaning from a large central bay, spat meditatively into the garden.It was time I went back.While the rain continued it had seemed like the murmur of their voices, rising and swelling a little, now and then, with gusts of emotion.But in the new silence I felt that silence had fallen within the house too."
"我走了进去——在厨房里弄出各种声响，像是把炉子掀翻了一般——但是我觉得他们好像什么都没听见。他们俩分别坐在沙发的两端，相互注视着对方，似乎提出了什么问题，或像有什么问题悬而未决，却没有一点尴尬的迹象。黛西的脸上满是泪水。我进来的时候，她跳了起来，对着镜子用手帕擦拭着。但是盖茨比却发生了令人不解的变化。他一副神采飞扬的样子，虽然没有什么欣喜的言语姿势，身上却分明散发着一种喜气，这种喜气充满了整个小屋。","I went in—after making every possible noise in the kitchen short of pushing over the stove—but I don’t believe they heard a sound.They were sitting at either end of the couch looking at each other as if some question had been asked or was in the air, and every vestige of embarrassment was gone.Daisy’s face was smeared with tears and when I came in she jumped up and began wiping at it with her handkerchief before a mirror.But there was a change in Gatsby that was simply confounding.He literally glowed; without a word or a gesture of exultation a new well-being radiated from him and filled the little room."
"“哦，你好，老兄。”他说道，仿佛好多年没见过我了。那会儿，我还真以为他要过来和我握手。","‘Oh, hello, old sport,’ he said, as if he hadn’t seen me for years.I thought for a moment he was going to shake hands."
"“雨已经停了。”","‘It’s stopped raining.’"
"“是吗？”当他意识到我说话的意思，又看到一缕缕阳光射进了屋里时，脸上露出了微笑，活像一个天气预报员，又仿佛一个欣喜若狂的光明守护神，将消息转报给黛西。“感觉怎么样？雨已经停了。”","‘Has it?’When he realized what I was talking about, that there were twinkle-bells of sunshine in the room, he smiled like a weather man, like an ecstatic patron of recurrent light, and repeated the news to Daisy.‘What do you think of that?It’s stopped raining.’"
"“我很开心，杰伊。”她的声音凄美哀婉，只是表达了一下自己意外的惊喜。","‘I’m glad, Jay.’Her throat, full of aching, grieving beauty, told only of her unexpected joy."
"“我想请你和黛西一起来我家，”他说，“我想带她到处看看。”","‘I want you and Daisy to come over to my house,’ he said, ‘I’d like to show her around.’"
"“你确定想让我过去吗？”","‘You’re sure you want me to come?’"
"“当然了，老兄。”","‘Absolutely, old sport.’"
"黛西上楼去洗脸了——我想起了自己那块毛巾，感到很是惭愧，可是已经太晚了——盖茨比和我在草坪上等着她。","Daisy went upstairs to wash her face—too late I thought with humiliation of my towels—while Gatsby and I waited on the lawn."
"“我的房子看起来还不错，是不是啊？”他问道，“你看整个楼的正面采光都很好。”我表示赞同，房子确实是挺漂亮的。","‘My house looks well, doesn’t it?’ he demanded.‘See how the whole front of it catches the light.’I agreed that it was splendid."
"“是的。”他仔细打量着房子，每一扇拱门，每一座方塔，“我只花了三年就赚够了买房子的钱。”","‘Yes.’His eyes went over it, every arched door and square tower.‘It took me just three years to earn the money that bought it.’"
"“我还以为你的钱是继承来的呢。”","‘I thought you inherited your money.’"
"“我是继承了，老兄，”他不假思索地说道，“但是在大恐慌期间我损失了一半——就是战争大恐慌。”","‘I did, old sport,’ he said automatically, ‘but I lost most of it in the big panic—the panic of the war.’"
"我想他根本不知道自己在说些什么，因为当我问他到底是干什么生意的时候，他回答说：“那是我自己的事。”可是话刚出口，他就意识到自己的回答很不得体。“哦，我干过好几种生意。”他改口说道，“我做过药材生意，然后做了石油生意。但是我现在两种生意都不做了。”他非常专注地看着我。“你是说你已经考虑过了我那天晚上的提议？”","I think he hardly knew what he was saying, for when I asked him what business he was in he answered ‘That’s my affair,’ before he realized that it wasn’t the appropriate reply.‘Oh, I’ve been in several things,’ he corrected himself.‘I was in the drug business and then I was in the oil business.But I’m not in either one now.’He looked at me with more attention.‘Do you mean you’ve been thinking over what I proposed the other night?’"
"我还没来得及回答，黛西就从房间里走了出来，她裙子上的两排铜纽扣在阳光中闪闪发光。","Before I could answer, Daisy came out of the house and two rows of brass buttons on her dress gleamed in the sunlight."
"“就是那边那栋大房子吗？”她用手指着大声问道。“你喜欢吗？”","‘That huge place THERE?’ she cried pointing.‘Do you like it?’"
"“我很喜欢，但是我不明白你怎么自己一个人住那里。”","‘I love it, but I don’t see how you live there all alone.’"
"“我总是邀请许多有趣的人，不分昼夜，把房间挤得满满的。一些做着有意思事情的人。社会各界名流。”","‘I keep it always full of interesting people, night and day.People who do interesting things.Celebrated people.’"
"我们没有沿着海边走小路过去，而是沿着大路，从一扇很大的后门走了进去。黛西用她那迷人的声音低声赞美着眼前的一切，赞美着在蓝天的映衬下这座中世纪城堡的轮廓，赞美着花园里竞相开放的各种花：长寿花四溢的芬芳、山楂花和梅花淡淡的清香，还有淡金色“吻别花”的香气。　一路走到大理石台阶前，并没有看到那些身着华丽服饰的人进进出出，却只听到树上小鸟的鸣叫声，这一切都让人觉得怪怪的。","Instead of taking the short cut along the Sound we went down the road and entered by the big postern.With enchanting murmurs Daisy admired this aspect or that of the feudal silhouette against the sky, admired the gardens, the sparkling odor of jonquils and the frothy odor of hawthorn and plum blossoms and the pale gold odor of kiss-me-at-the-gate.It was strange to reach the marble steps and find no stir of bright dresses in and out the door, and hear no sound but bird voices in the trees."
"走进房里，我们漫步穿过了玛丽·安托瓦尼特式的音乐厅和王政复辟时期风格的小客厅，我总觉得每个沙发、每张桌子后面都藏着客人，他们奉命屏住呼吸躲在后面，安安静静地等着我们走过去。当盖茨比关上了“默顿学院图书室”的大门时，我敢发誓我当时听到了戴猫头鹰眼镜的人突然发出幽灵般的笑声。我们来到楼上，穿过一间间古色古香的卧室，里面铺满了一条条玫瑰色和淡紫色的绸缎，摆满了五颜六色的新鲜花朵，我们还穿过了一间间更衣室、一间间弹子室，还有一间间配有地下浴池的浴室——我们还闯进了一间卧室，里面一个蓬头垢面的男的正穿着睡衣在地板上做肝部运动。他是克里普斯普林格先生，那个“寄宿者”。那天早上我还看见他拖着饥饿的身体在沙滩上闲逛。最后我们来到盖茨比本人的套房，里面有一间卧室、一间浴室和一间小书房，我们在书房里坐了下来，喝了一杯他从壁橱拿出来的法国荨麻酒。","And inside as we wandered through Marie Antoinette music rooms and Restoration salons I felt that there were guests concealed behind every couch and table, under orders to be breathlessly silent until we had passed through.As Gatsby closed the door of ‘the Merton College Library’ I could have sworn I heard the owl-eyed man break into ghostly laughter.We went upstairs, through period bedrooms swathed in rose and lavender silk and vivid with new flowers, through dressing rooms and poolrooms, and bathrooms with sunken baths—intruding into one chamber where a dishevelled man in pajamas was doing liver exercises on the floor.It was Mr. Klipspringer, the ‘boarder.’I had seen him wandering hungrily about the beach that morning.Finally we came to Gatsby’s own apartment, a bedroom and a bath and an Adam study, where we sat down and drank a glass of some Chartreuse he took from a cupboard in the wall."
"他一直看着黛西，我觉得他在观察黛西那迷人的双眼的反应，然后根据她的反应重新评估自己屋里的每一样东西。有时候他会神色茫然地朝四周看看家里的东西，仿佛她的真实却出人意料的出现使周围的一切都变得不再真实。有一次他还差点从楼梯上摔下去。","He hadn’t once ceased looking at Daisy and I think he revalued everything in his house according to the measure of response it drew from her well-loved eyes.Sometimes, too, he stared around at his possessions in a dazed way as though in her actual and astounding presence none of it was any longer real.Once he nearly toppled down a flight of stairs."
"他自己的卧室是所有屋子中最简朴的一间——只有梳妆台上点缀着一副纯金的梳妆用具。黛西很开心地拿起梳子梳了梳头发，这时盖茨比坐了下来，用手捂着眼睛开始笑了起来。","His bedroom was the simplest room of all—except where the dresser was garnished with a toilet set of pure dull gold.Daisy took the brush with delight and smoothed her hair, whereupon Gatsby sat down and shaded his eyes and began to laugh."
"“这真是太有意思了，老兄。”他无比愉悦地说道，“我简直不能……每当我想要……”","‘It’s the funniest thing, old sport,’ he said hilariously.‘I can’t—when I try to—’"
"他的状态显然是经历过了两个阶段，现在正进入到第三个阶段。他先是局促不安，而后变得欣喜若狂，现在却因她的意外出现而惊讶不已。他这些年来一直都朝思暮想，梦寐以求，可以说是咬紧牙关日夜期盼，他的热切程度是令人无法想象的。而现在，他就像一只发条上得太紧的时钟作出了回应，完全已经精疲力竭。","He had passed visibly through two states and was entering upon a third.After his embarrassment and his unreasoning joy he was consumed with wonder at her presence.He had been full of the idea so long, dreamed it right through to the end, waited with his teeth set, so to speak, at an inconceivable pitch of intensity.Now, in the reaction, he was running down like an overwound clock."
"过了一会儿，他恢复了平静，便打开两个做工精细的特大衣橱给我们看，里面装满了他的西装、晨衣和领带，摆放的衬衣像十几块砖头堆在一起一样高。","Recovering himself in a minute he opened for us two hulking patent cabinets which held his massed suits and dressing-gowns and ties, and his shirts, piled like bricks in stacks a dozen high."
"“有一个人在英国帮我买衣服。每年春秋伊始，他就会挑选一些衣服给我寄过来。”","‘I’ve got a man in England who buys me clothes.He sends over a selection of things at the beginning of each season, spring and fall.’"
"他拿出一摞衬衫，一件一件地丢在我们面前，有纯麻布的、厚丝绸的、细法兰绒的，全部抖散开了，五颜六色地摊了一桌。我们一边欣赏，他一边把衬衫往外拿，这些柔软华丽的衬衫堆得越来越高——条子的、花纹的、方格子的、珊瑚色的、苹果绿的、淡紫色的、浅橙色的，上边还织着他的名字，呈深蓝色。突然黛西发出了压抑已久的声音，她将头埋进衬衫堆里，放声大哭起来。","He took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them, one by one before us, shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel which lost their folds as they fell and covered the table in many-colored disarray.While we admired he brought more and the soft rich heap mounted higher—shirts with stripes and scrolls and plaids in coral and apple-green and lavender and faint orange with monograms of Indian blue.Suddenly with a strained sound, Daisy bent her head into the shirts and began to cry stormily."
"“这些衬衫太漂亮了，”她抽泣着说，在厚厚的衬衫堆里，她的声音有些发闷，“我看了很伤心，因为以前我从来没见过如此——如此漂亮的衬衫。”","‘They’re such beautiful shirts,’ she sobbed, her voice muffled in the thick folds.‘It makes me sad because I’ve never seen such—such beautiful shirts before.’"
"看过房子之后，我们原本打算去看庭院、游泳池、水上飞机和仲夏盛开的群花——但是在盖茨比房间看窗外，雨又开始下了起来，于是我们三人站成一排，望着水波荡漾的海面。","After the house, we were to see the grounds and the swimming pool, and the hydroplane and the midsummer flowers—but outside Gatsby’s window it began to rain again so we stood in a row looking at the corrugated surface of the Sound."
"“要是没有雾的话，我们就能看到海岸对面你家的房子。”盖茨比说，“你家码头的尽头总有一盏绿灯通宵亮着。”黛西用胳膊挽住盖茨比的胳膊，但是他却似乎还沉浸在自己刚才所说的话里。也许他突然意识到那盏灯对于他的重大意义已经永远不存在了。那盏灯曾经将他和黛西遥远地隔开，而现在，它离她如此之近，近乎于可以触碰到她。就好像星星和月亮那样近在咫尺。现在它又变回了码头上的一盏绿灯。那令他神魂颠倒的东西又少了一样。","‘If it wasn’t for the mist we could see your home across the bay,’ said Gatsby.‘You always have a green light that burns all night at the end of your dock.’Daisy put her arm through his abruptly but he seemed absorbed in what he had just said.Possibly it had occurred to him that the colossal significance of that light had now vanished forever.Compared to the great distance that had separated him from Daisy it had seemed very near to her, almost touching her.It had seemed as close as a star to the moon.Now it was again a green light on a dock.His count of enchanted objects had diminished by one."
"我开始在屋里到处走动，在半明半暗的光线里仔细观察着屋里模糊不清的各种摆设。他桌子上方的墙上挂着一幅巨大照片，吸引了我的目光，照片上是一位身着游艇服、上了年纪的男人。","I began to walk about the room, examining various indefinite objects in the half darkness.A large photograph of an elderly man in yachting costume attracted me, hung on the wall over his desk."
"“这是谁？”","‘Who’s this?’"
"“那个？那是丹·科迪先生，老兄。”","‘That?That’s Mr. Dan Cody, old sport.’"
"这个名字听起来隐约有点耳熟。","The name sounded faintly familiar."
"“他现在已经死了。很多年前他是我最好的朋友。”","‘He’s dead now.He used to be my best friend years ago.’"
"衣柜上还有一张盖茨比本人的小照片，也是穿着游艇服——盖茨比将头后仰着，一副目中无人的表情——这张照片显然是在他十八岁左右时拍的。","There was a small picture of Gatsby, also in yachting costume, on the bureau—Gatsby with his head thrown back defiantly—taken apparently when he was about eighteen."
"“我喜欢这张！”黛西大声叫道，“这种大背头的发型真帅！你从来都没告诉过我你还留过大背头，也没告诉过我你有一艘游艇。”","‘I adore it!’ exclaimed Daisy.‘The pompadour!You never told me you had a pompadour—or a yacht.’"
"“看这个，”盖茨比赶忙说，“这儿有很多剪报——都是和你有关的。”","‘Look at this,’ said Gatsby quickly.‘Here’s a lot of clip-pings—about you.’"
"他们俩肩并肩站在那里仔细看着那些剪报。我正想问他看看他收藏的那些红宝石，这时电话响了，盖茨比拿起了听筒。","They stood side by side examining it.I was going to ask to see the rubies when the phone rang and Gatsby took up the receiver."
"“是。嗯，我现在不方便说话……我现在不方便说话，老兄……我说是个小城市……他肯定知道小城市的意思……嗯，如果底特律就是他心目中的小城市，那他对我们也没有什么用处……”他挂上了电话。","‘Yes..Well, I can’t talk now..I can’t talk now, old sport..I said a SMALL town..He must know what a small town is....Well, he’s no use to us if Detroit is his idea of a small town....’He rang off."
"“快过来！”黛西在窗前喊道。","‘Come here QUICK!’ cried Daisy at the window."
"雨还在下着，但西方的乌云却已经散开，海湾上空翻腾着粉色和金色的彩云。","The rain was still falling, but the darkness had parted in the west, and there was a pink and golden billow of foamy clouds above the sea."
"“看那边，”她柔声说道，过了一会儿便又说，“我想采一朵粉色的云彩，将你放到上面，然后推着你到处走。”","‘Look at that,’ she whispered, and then after a moment: ‘I’d like to just get one of those pink clouds and put you in it and push you around.’"
"那时我想走了，可是怎么说他们都不同意，也许我的存在可以让他们更加心安理得地呆在一起吧。","I tried to go then, but they wouldn’t hear of it; perhaps my presence made them feel more satisfactorily alone."
"“我知道我们干什么好了，”盖茨比说道，“我们来听克里普斯普林格弹钢琴吧。”","‘I know what we’ll do,’ said Gatsby, ‘we’ll have Klip-springer play the piano.’"
"他走出房间喊了一声“尤因！”，进来时带着一个表情局促，面色憔悴的年轻人，那个年轻人戴着一副玳瑁边眼镜，一头稀疏的金黄色头发。他现在着装得体，一件敞领运动衫、一双运动鞋，还有一条颜色不明显的帆布裤子。","He went out of the room calling ‘Ewing!’ and returned in a few minutes accompanied by an embarrassed, slightly worn young man with shell-rimmed glasses and scanty blonde hair.He was now decently clothed in a ‘sport shirt’ open at the neck, sneakers and duck trousers of a nebulous hue."
"“我们是不是打扰你练习啦？”黛西很有礼貌地问。","‘Did we interrupt your exercises?’ inquired Daisy politely."
"“我在睡觉。”克里普斯普林格先生一脸尴尬地大声说道，“我是说，我本来在睡觉。然后就起来了……”","‘I was asleep,’ cried Mr. Klipspringer, in a spasm of embarrassment.‘That is, I’d BEEN asleep.Then I got up....’"
"“克里普斯普林格会弹钢琴。”盖茨比打断他的话说道，“是不是，尤因，老兄？”","‘Klipspringer plays the piano,’ said Gatsby, cutting him off.‘Don’t you, Ewing, old sport?’"
"“我弹得并不好。我不……根本就不怎么弹。我好久没练……”","‘I don’t play well.I don’t—I hardly play at all.I’m all out of prac—’"
"“我们下楼吧。”盖茨比打断他的话说道。他轻轻地按了一下开关。灰暗的窗户不见了，整个房子立刻变得灯火通明。","‘We’ll go downstairs,’ interrupted Gatsby.He flipped a switch.The grey windows disappeared as the house glowed full of light."
"在音乐厅里，盖茨比只打开了钢琴旁的一盏落地灯。他颤抖着用火柴为黛西点燃了一支香烟，然后同她一起远远坐在屋子那头的一张沙发上，那边除了地板上反射过来一点光亮之外，没有任何灯光。","In the music room Gatsby turned on a solitary lamp beside the piano.He lit Daisy’s cigarette from a trembling match, and sat down with her on a couch far across the room where there was no light save what the gleaming floor bounced in from the hall."
"当克里普斯普林格弹完“爱情的安乐窝”之后，他在琴凳上转过身来，很不开心地朝着昏暗处张望，寻找着盖茨比：","When Klipspringer had played ‘The Love Nest’ he turned around on the bench and searched unhappily for Gatsby in the gloom."
"“我好久没练了，你看。我就告诉你我不会弹。我好久没练……”","‘I’m all out of practice, you see.I told you I couldn’t play.I’m all out of prac—’"
"“别说这么多话，老兄。”盖茨比命令道，“弹！”","‘Don’t talk so much, old sport,’ commanded Gatsby.‘Play!’"
"“每日清晨，每日黄昏，我们无比欢畅……”","IN THE MORNING, IN THE EVENING, AIN’T WE GOT FUN—"
"外面风声呼呼作响，海上传来隐隐约约的雷鸣声。此时西卵已经是万家灯火，从纽约开来的电气火车也满载着客人，从雨中疾驰而来。这一刻，人生将会发生深刻的变化，连空气里都洋溢着激动的情绪。","Outside the wind was loud and there was a faint flow of thunder along the Sound.All the lights were going on in West Egg now; the electric trains, men-carrying, were plunging home through the rain from New York.It was the hour of a profound human change, and excitement was generating on the air."
"有一件事情千真万确：富人生财，穷人生——孩子。","ONE THING’S SURE AND NOTHING’S SURER THE RICH GET RICHER AND THE POOR GET-CHILDREN. "
"二者同时，时此时彼。我走过去道别，却看到盖茨比的脸上再次浮现出一种疑惑的表情，他仿佛在怀疑此刻的幸福是否是真真实实的。将近五年的时间了！即便是那天下午，肯定也有那么一些时刻让他感到其实黛西并没有他梦想得那么好——这也并不是她的错，而是他自己的幻想太过精彩的缘故。这种幻想超越了她本人，超越了一切。他以一种创造性的激情将自己融入到这种幻想中，而且不断地添枝加叶，用每一根随便飘来的闪亮羽毛加以装饰。任何的激情活力或是新鲜刺激也比不上一个人阴凄的内心深处堆积起来的那种情愫。","IN THE MEANTIME, IN BETWEEN TIME-As I went over to say goodbye I saw that the expression of bewilderment had come back into Gatsby’s face, as though a faint doubt had occurred to him as to the quality of his present happiness.Almost five years!There must have been moments even that afternoon when Daisy tumbled short of his dreams—not through her own fault but because of the colossal vitality of his illusion.It had gone beyond her, beyond everything.He had thrown himself into it with a creative passion, adding to it all the time, decking it out with every bright feather that drifted his way.No amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man will store up in his ghostly heart."
"我注视着他的时候，看得出他稍微调整了一下自己。他用手握住她的手，然后她在他的耳边地声说了些什么，他便立刻朝她转过去，感情非常激动。我觉得最使他入迷的就是那婉转动听，激情洋溢的声音，因为即便是在梦里他也无法听到那样美妙的声音——那声音是一曲永恒的歌。","As I watched him he adjusted himself a little, visibly.His hand took hold of hers and as she said something low in his ear he turned toward her with a rush of emotion.I think that voice held him most with its fluctuating, feverish warmth because it couldn’t be over-dreamed—that voice was a deathless song."
"他们已经忘了我还在，但是黛西朝上瞅了一眼，然后将手伸了出来。盖茨比现在根本不认识我了。我再次看了看他们，他们也朝我看了看，却恍如隔世一般，沉浸在强烈的情感之中。随后我走出了房间，下了大理石台阶，朝雨中走去，留下他们两个人在一起。","They had forgotten me, but Daisy glanced up and held out her hand; Gatsby didn’t know me now at all.I looked once more at them and they looked back at me, remotely, possessed by intense life.Then I went out of the room and down the marble steps into the rain, leaving them there together."
"第六章","Chapter 6"
"不久后的一天早上，一位雄心勃勃的年轻记者从纽约赶到盖茨比家，请他随便说点什么。","About this time an ambitious young reporter from New York arrived one morning at Gatsby’s door and asked him if he had anything to say."
"“随便说点什么呢？”盖茨比礼貌地问道。“呃——随便发表点什么观点。”糊里糊涂地过了五分钟，才弄明白到底是怎么回事，原来这个男的在他工作的报馆里曾听人提到盖茨比的名字，可是他却不肯透漏为什么提到，或许他自己也不是很清楚。今天他休息，于是便积极主动跑出城来“看看”。","‘Anything to say about what?’ inquired Gatsby politely.‘Why,—any statement to give out.’It transpired after a confused five minutes that the man had heard Gatsby’s name around his office in a connection which he either wouldn’t reveal or didn’t fully understand.This was his day off and with laudable initiative he had hurried out ‘to see.’"
"这也不过是碰碰运气，而这位记者的直觉却完全正确。这个夏天里盖茨比的名声越来越大，都快变成了一个新闻人物了，这都是那成百上千受过他热情款待的人们到处传播的结果，这些客人也因此成了他的身世经历的权威。当时的各种传奇故事，诸如“通往加拿大的地下管道”之类，都和他扯上了关系。还有一个长期流传的故事，那就是他其实根本不住在房间里，而是住在一艘貌似房子的船上，然后沿着长岛的海岸神秘地来回游弋。到底为什么这个来自北达科他州的詹姆斯·盖兹能从这些谣言中得到满足，原因就不得而知了。","It was a random shot, and yet the reporter’s instinct was right.Gatsby’s notoriety, spread about by the hundreds who had accepted his hospitality and so become authorities on his past, had increased all summer until he fell just short of being news.Contemporary legends such as the ‘underground pipe-line to Canada’ attached themselves to him, and there was one persistent story that he didn’t live in a house at all, but in a boat that looked like a house and was moved secretly up and down the Long Island shore.Just why these inventions were a source of satisfaction to James Gatz of North Dakota, isn’t easy to say."
"詹姆斯·盖兹——这是他真实的，或者至少是合法的名字。他在十七岁的时候改名换姓，而也正是在那个特殊的时期，他的事业刚刚起步——那时他看到丹·科迪的游艇在苏必利尔湖上最险峻的沙洲上抛锚了。那天下午他穿着一件破旧的绿色运动衫和一条帆布裤子在海滩上到处游荡时，名字还叫詹姆斯·盖兹，但是等他借了一条小船，划到托洛美号游艇那里，警告科迪说半个小时之内可能会刮起狂风吹翻他的整个游艇时，他已经是杰伊·盖茨比了。","James Gatz—that was really, or at least legally, his name.He had changed it at the age of seventeen and at the specific moment that witnessed the beginning of his career—when he saw Dan Cody’s yacht drop anchor over the most insidious flat on Lake Superior.It was James Gatz who had been loafing along the beach that afternoon in a torn green jersey and a pair of canvas pants, but it was already Jay Gatsby who borrowed a row-boat, pulled out to the TUOLOMEE and informed Cody that a wind might catch him and break him up in half an hour."
"我想在那时候他已早把这个名字准备好了。他的父母亲是平平庸庸、碌碌无为的庄稼人——在他的意识里就从来没有真正把他们当作自己的父母。事实上，长岛西卵的杰伊·盖茨比是他自己柏拉图式的理念中的产物。他是上帝的儿子——这个称呼若是有什么意思的话，那就是其字面意思——因此他必须为他的天父效命，致力于实现一种博大、庸俗、浮华的美。因此他虚构的那个杰伊·盖茨比也正是一个十七岁的男孩可能想到的，他始终不渝地忠实于这个理想的形象。","I suppose he’d had the name ready for a long time, even then.His parents were shiftless and unsuccessful farm people—his imagination had never really accepted them as his parents at all.The truth was that Jay Gatsby, of West Egg, Long Island, sprang from his Platonic conception of himself.He was a son of God—a phrase which, if it means anything, means just that—and he must be about His Father’s Business, the service of a vast, vulgar and meretricious beauty.So he invented just the sort of Jay Gatsby that a seventeen-year-old boy would be likely to invent, and to this conception he was faithful to the end."
"在一年多的时间里，他在苏必利尔湖南岸四处闯荡，或是捞蛤蜊，或是捕鲑鱼，抑或是做其他一些能够保障他基本生活的杂事。在那些令人振奋的日子里，他那晒得黝黑、越发结实的身体轻松应付着时而紧张时而松懈的工作。他很早就和女人有了交往，而且由于受到女人的宠爱，他倒有些看不起她们，他看不起年轻的处女，因为她们天真无知；他也看不起其他的女人，因为她们遇到事情就歇斯底里，而这些事情在过于自以为是的他看来却是理所当然的。","For over a year he had been beating his way along the south shore of Lake Superior as a clam digger and a salmon fisher or in any other capacity that brought him food and bed.His brown, hardening body lived naturally through the half fierce, half lazy work of the bracing days.He knew women early and since they spoiled him he became contemptuous of them, of young virgins because they were ignorant, of the others because they were hysterical about things which in his overwhelming self-absorption he took for granted."
"但是他的内心却一直处于躁动不安之中。每晚他躺在床上的时候，各种离奇古怪、荒诞不经的念头便蜂拥而至。一个无法形容的华丽世界浮现在他的脑海中，时钟在洗脸架上嘀嘀嗒嗒作响，地上他那乱七八糟的衣服浸泡在如水的月光里。每天晚上他都会给自己的幻想加些内容，直到睡意袭来，将这些惟妙惟肖的场面在不知不觉中掩埋。有一段时间，这些幻想为他的想象力提供了一种发泄方式，它们非常令人满意地暗示现实是不真实的，同时也表明世界的基石是牢牢建立在仙女的翅膀上的。","But his heart was in a constant, turbulent riot.The most grotesque and fantastic conceits haunted him in his bed at night.A universe of ineffable gaudiness spun itself out in his brain while the clock ticked on the wash-stand and the moon soaked with wet light his tangled clothes upon the floor.Each night he added to the pattern of his fancies until drowsiness closed down upon some vivid scene with an oblivious embrace.For a while these reveries provided an outlet for his imagination; they were a satisfactory hint of the unreality of reality, a promise that the rock of the world was founded securely on a fairy’s wing."
"几个月前，一种渴求飞黄腾达的本能促使他来到明尼苏达州南部路德教的圣奥拉夫学院，一个很小的学院。他在那儿呆了两周，一方面学院对于他起起落落的命运的鼓声以及命运本身表现出极大地漠视，让他感到失望沮丧；另一方面他也不屑做一些看门人的活儿来支付自己的学费。于是他再次飘荡回到苏必利尔湖，那天他还在找事儿做，就看到丹·科迪的游艇在湖边沙滩上抛锚了。","An instinct toward his future glory had led him, some months before, to the small Lutheran college of St. Olaf in southern Minnesota.He stayed there two weeks, dismayed at its ferocious indifference to the drums of his destiny, to destiny itself, and despising the janitor’s work with which he was to pay his way through.Then he drifted back to Lake Superior, and he was still searching for something to do on the day that Dan Cody’s yacht dropped anchor in the shallows along shore."
"科迪那时五十岁，是1875年以来每次淘金热的参与者，内华达州的银矿和育空地区的金矿他都参与过。蒙大拿州的铜矿交易让他赚了几百万。最后他虽然身体强壮，脑子却有点糊涂，无数的女人察觉到了这一点，想尽一切办法想将他的钱财骗过来。一位名叫埃拉·凯的女记者抓住了他的弱点，扮演了德曼特农夫人的角色，她怂恿他乘游艇沿海航行，而这种不光彩的手段也成了1902年那些乐于炒作的报刊争相报道的新闻。五年来他沿岸航行，受到当地热情好客的居民的款待。而他驶入少女湾的那天，却成了詹姆斯·盖兹命运的转折点。","Cody was fifty years old then, a product of the Nevada silver fields, of the Yukon, of every rush for metal since Seventy-five.The transactions in Montana copper that made him many times a millionaire found him physically robust but on the verge of soft-mindedness, and, suspecting this an infinite number of women tried to separate him from his money.The none too savory ramifications by which Ella Kaye, the newspaper woman, played Madame de Main-tenon to his weakness and sent him to sea in a yacht, were common knowledge to the turgid journalism of 1902.He had been coasting along all too hospitable shores for five years when he turned up as James Gatz’s destiny at Little Girl Bay."
"年轻的盖兹双手支着船桨，抬头看着围着栏杆的甲板。对于他来说，这艘船代表着世界上一切的美妙与诱惑。我猜想他会冲科迪微微一笑——他大概已经发现了自己在微笑的时候是最惹人喜欢的。科迪至少还是问了他几个问题（其中一个问题就引出了这个全新的名字。），发现他思维敏捷且胸怀大志。几天后科迪带着他来到德卢斯，给他买了一件蓝色的外套、六条白色帆布裤和一顶游艇帽。随后托洛美号启程前往西印度洋群岛和巴巴平海岸，盖茨比也一同跟船走了。","To the young Gatz, resting on his oars and looking up at the railed deck, the yacht represented all the beauty and glamor in the world.I suppose he smiled at Cody—he had probably discovered that people liked him when he smiled.At any rate Cody asked him a few questions (one of them elicited the brand new name) and found that he was quick, and extravagantly ambitious.A few days later he took him to Duluth and bought him a blue coat, six pair of white duck trousers and a yachting cap.And when the TUOLOMEE left for the West Indies and the Barbary Coast Gatsby left too."
"他以一种不太明确的私人雇员身份在科迪的手下干事——跟着科迪他先后做过服务生、大副、船长、秘书，甚至还做过监守。丹·科迪清醒的时候知道自己在醉酒时什么挥金如土的事情都干得出来，因此为了防止此类事情意外发生，他给予了盖茨比越来越多的信任。这种情况持续了五年之久，而那艘船也绕大陆航行了三圈。这种情况本来可以无限地持续下去。但是有一天晚上，埃拉·凯在波士顿上了船，然后丹·科迪便在一周后凄然去世。","He was employed in a vague personal capacity—while he remained with Cody he was in turn steward, mate, skipper, secretary, and even jailor, for Dan Cody sober knew what lavish doings Dan Cody drunk might soon be about and he provided for such contingencies by reposing more and more trust in Gatsby.The arrangement lasted five years during which the boat went three times around the continent.It might have lasted indefinitely except for the fact that Ella Kaye came on board one night in Boston and a week later Dan Cody inhospitably died."
"我依然记得挂在盖茨比卧室墙上的那张他的照片。一位满头银发、面色红润的老人，一张冷淡而空虚的脸——典型的沉湎于酒色的美国拓荒者。在美国人生活的某一阶段，这些人将边疆妓院和酒馆的那种野蛮与暴力带到了东部的沿海城市。盖茨比饮酒很少，这也当间接地归功于科迪。有时候在欢闹的宴会上，女人们会将香槟揉进他的头发里，而他本人还是养成了滴酒不沾的习惯。","I remember the portrait of him up in Gatsby’s bedroom, a grey, florid man with a hard empty face—the pioneer debauchee who during one phase of American life brought back to the eastern seaboard the savage violence of the frontier brothel and saloon.It was indirectly due to Cody that Gatsby drank so little.Sometimes in the course of gay parties women used to rub champagne into his hair; for himself he formed the habit of letting liquor alone."
"也正是从科迪那里，他继承了一笔钱——一笔两万五千美元的遗产。他并没有拿到钱。他从来都不明白人家是用了怎样的法律手段来对付他的，但是百万财产的剩下部分完完全全都被埃拉·凯拿走了。他得到的仅是那种独特又恰当的教育，盖茨比模糊的形象逐渐变得清晰了，他成了一个有血有肉的男人。","And it was from Cody that he inherited money—a legacy of twenty-five thousand dollars.He didn’t get it.He never understood the legal device that was used against him but what remained of the millions went intact to Ella Kaye.He was left with his singularly appropriate education; the vague contour of Jay Gatsby had filled out to the substantiality of a man."
"很久以后他才将这一切告诉我，但我将这些在这里写出来，主要是为了驳斥那些关于他的身世的流言蜚语，那些谣言全都是捕风捉影。而且他是在我十分困惑的时候告诉我的。那时对于他的种种传闻，我时而全盘皆信；时而一概不信。因此利用这个短暂的间歇，我想澄清一下种种误解，同时也借此给盖茨比一个喘息的机会。","He told me all this very much later, but I’ve put it down here with the idea of exploding those first wild rumors about his antecedents, which weren’t even faintly true.Moreover he told it to me at a time of confusion, when I had reached the point of believing everything and nothing about him.So I take advantage of this short halt, while Gatsby, so to speak, caught his breath, to clear this set of misconceptions away."
"在我和他的交往中，这也是一个间歇。已经有好几个星期了，我没有见到他，也没有接到过他来的电话——大多数时间我都在纽约和乔丹一起到处闲逛，并竭力想讨好她那年迈的姨妈——但最终我还是在一个周日的下午去了他家。我到后还没过两分钟，就有人把汤姆·布坎南带来喝酒了。我自然是惊讶无比，但真正令人惊讶的是，这种事今天还是头一次发生。","It was a halt, too, in my association with his affairs.For several weeks I didn’t see him or hear his voice on the phone—mostly I was in New York, trotting around with Jordan and trying to ingratiate myself with her senile aunt—but finally I went over to his house one Sunday afternoon.I hadn’t been there two minutes when somebody brought Tom Buchanan in for a drink.I was startled, naturally, but the really surprising thing was that it hadn’t happened before."
"他们三人一起骑马而来——汤姆和一个名叫斯隆的男人，还有一个身穿棕色骑装的漂亮女人，她以前来过这里。","They were a party of three on horseback—Tom and a man named Sloane and a pretty woman in a brown riding habit who had been there previously."
"“很高兴见到你们。”盖茨比站在门廊上说，“你们的光临让我无比开心。”","‘I’m delighted to see you,’ said Gatsby standing on his porch.‘I’m delighted that you dropped in.’"
"好像他们很在乎似的！","As though they cared!"
"“快请坐。抽支香烟，或者雪茄。”他在屋子里跑来跑去，忙着按铃叫人来，“我马上叫人给你们送点喝的来。”","‘Sit right down.Have a cigarette or a cigar.’He walked around the room quickly, ringing bells.‘I’ll have something to drink for you in just a minute.’"
"汤姆的到来让他甚感意外。但是不管怎样，他还是觉得局促不安。直到他招待了他们一番后，才隐约意识到他们过来的目的也不过就是喝点东西歇一歇。斯隆先生什么都不要。一杯柠檬水？不要，谢谢了。少来点香槟？什么都不要，谢谢了……不好意思……","He was profoundly affected by the fact that Tom was there.But he would be uneasy anyhow until he had given them something, realizing in a vague way that that was all they came for.Mr. Sloane wanted nothing.A lemonade?No, thanks.A little champagne?Nothing at all, thanks..I’m sorry—"
"“你们骑马玩得开心吧？”","‘Did you have a nice ride?’"
"“这儿附近的路很好。”","‘Very good roads around here.’"
"“我猜想过往的汽车……”","‘I suppose the automobiles—’"
"“是的。”","‘Yeah.’"
"刚才介绍时，汤姆只当他们是初次见面，但此刻盖茨比却情不自禁地转过头去看着汤姆。","Moved by an irresistible impulse, Gatsby turned to Tom who had accepted the introduction as a stranger."
"“我觉得我们以前在哪儿见过，布坎南先生。”","‘I believe we’ve met somewhere before, Mr. Buchanan.’"
"“哦，对。”汤姆出于礼貌生硬地回答道，但很明显他已经不记得了，“我们确实见过。我记得很清楚。”","‘Oh, yes,’ said Tom, gruffly polite but obviously not remembering.‘So we did.I remember very well.’"
"“大约在两周前。”","‘About two weeks ago.’"
"“对。你当时和尼克在一起。”","‘That’s right.You were with Nick here.’"
"“我认识你的妻子。”盖茨比继续说道，带着些挑衅的味道。","‘I know your wife,’ continued Gatsby, almost aggressively."
"“是吗？”","‘That so?’"
"汤姆转过头来看着我。","Tom turned to me."
"“你就住这儿附近吧，尼克？”“在隔壁。”“是吗？”","‘You live near here, Nick?’‘Next door.’‘That so?’"
"斯隆先生并没有加入我们的谈话，却只是傲慢地躺在椅子上，那个女的也一声不吭——直到两杯加冰的威士忌下肚之后，她突然变得热情起来。","Mr. Sloane didn’t enter into the conversation but lounged back haughtily in his chair; the woman said nothing either—until unexpectedly, after two highballs, she became cordial."
"“我们都会来参加你下次的聚会，盖茨比先生。”她提议说道，“你看怎么样?”","‘We’ll all come over to your next party, Mr. Gatsby,’ she suggested.‘What do you say?’"
"“当然好了。你们能来参加，我真是太高兴了。”","‘Certainly.I’d be delighted to have you.’"
"“很好。”斯隆先生说道，没有半点谢意，“哦——我看我们该回家了。”","‘Be ver’ nice,’ said Mr. Sloane, without gratitude.‘Well—think ought to be starting home.’"
"“请别急着走。”盖茨比竭力挽留道。他现在已经控制住了自己，而且他想多了解一下汤姆。“你们何不——你们何不留下来吃晚饭呢？说不定纽约还会有别的人要来。”","‘Please don’t hurry,’ Gatsby urged them.He had control of himself now and he wanted to see more of Tom.‘Why don’t you—why don’t you stay for supper?I wouldn’t be surprised if some other people dropped in from New York.’"
"“你们来我家吃晚饭吧。”那位女士热情地说，“你们两个都来。”","‘You come to supper with ME,’ said the lady enthusiastically.‘Both of you.’"
"这其中包括了我。斯隆先生站了起来。","This included me.Mr. Sloane got to his feet."
"“走吧。”他说——但只是对她一个人说。","‘Come along,’ he said—but to her only."
"“我是认真的。”她坚持说道，“我非常希望你们能来。有的是地方。”","‘I mean it,’ she insisted.‘I’d love to have you.Lots of room.’"
"盖茨比很疑惑地看着我。他想去，而且他没有看出来斯隆先生已经决定了不让他跟着去。","Gatsby looked at me questioningly.He wanted to go and he didn’t see that Mr. Sloane had determined he shouldn’t."
"“恐怕我是去不了了。”我说。","‘I’m afraid I won’t be able to,’ I said."
"“那么，你来嘛。”她竭力地集中说服盖茨比。","‘Well, you come,’ she urged, concentrating on Gatsby."
"斯隆先生凑到她的耳朵旁边低声说了几句。","Mr. Sloane murmured something close to her ear."
"“如果我们现在出发，我们是不可能晚的。”她固执地大声说道。","‘We won’t be late if we start now,’ she insisted aloud."
"“我没有马。”盖茨比说，“我在部队骑过马，但是我自己从来没买过马。我只能开车跟着你们。对不起，稍等我片刻。”","‘I haven’t got a horse,’ said Gatsby.‘I used to ride in the army but I’ve never bought a horse.I’ll have to follow you in my car.Excuse me for just a minute.’"
"我们其余几个人都来到了门廊上，斯隆和那位女士在一旁激烈地争执起来。","The rest of us walked out on the porch, where Sloane and the lady began an impassioned conversation aside."
"“天哪，我看这家伙真的要来了。”汤姆说道，“难道他不知道她并不是想让他来吗？”","‘My God, I believe the man’s coming,’ said Tom.‘Doesn’t he know she doesn’t want him?’"
"“她说她的确想要他来。”","‘She says she does want him.’"
"“她今晚举行的是盛大的晚宴，而他在那儿一个人也不认识。”他皱起眉头来。“我真纳闷儿他究竟是在哪儿认识黛西的。天晓得，也许我的想法有点过时了，但这年头女人到处乱跑，我可接受不了。她们会遇到形形色色的怪人。”","‘She has a big dinner party and he won’t know a soul there.’He frowned.‘I wonder where in the devil he met Daisy.By God, I may be old-fashioned in my ideas, but women run around too much these days to suit me.They meet all kinds of crazy fish.’"
"突然斯隆先生和那位女士走下台阶，上了自己的马。","Suddenly Mr. Sloane and the lady walked down the steps and mounted their horses."
"“走吧，”斯隆先生对汤姆说，“我们已经晚了。我们得赶快走了。”接着，他对我说：“告诉他我们没时间等了，好吗？”","‘Come on,’ said Mr. Sloane to Tom, ‘we’re late.We’ve got to go.’And then to me: ‘Tell him we couldn’t wait, will you?’"
"汤姆和我握了握手，我们其余的人相互冷冷地点了点头，随后他们便骑着马沿着车道快速小跑而去。等到盖茨比手里拿着帽子和大衣从前门出来的时候，他们已经消失在八月茂密的林荫里。","Tom and I shook hands, the rest of us exchanged a cool nod and they trotted quickly down the drive, disappearing under the August foliage just as Gatsby with hat and light overcoat in hand came out the front door."
"汤姆很显然对黛西一个人到处乱跑放不下心，因为随后的那个周六晚上，他同黛西一同来参加盖茨比的宴会。他的到来或许使得那天晚上的气氛显得异常压抑——于是同那个夏天盖茨比举行的其他宴会相比，这一次深深地印在了我的脑海里。同样还是那些人，或至少还是同一类人，同样有大量的香槟，同样是五颜六色、人声鼎沸的喧闹，我却感到空气里有种不友好的气氛，这种四处蔓延着的严肃是以前从来没有过的。或许我已经习惯了这一切，习惯于将西卵本身视为一个完整的世界，有它自己的标准和大人物，它是最好的，因此永远都不觉得自己比谁逊色，而现在我却要通过黛西的眼睛重新来认识这一切。你已经花了很多力气才适应的东西，却又要从新的视角去认识它，总会叫人十分难受。","Tom was evidently perturbed at Daisy’s running around alone, for on the following Saturday night he came with her to Gatsby’s party.Perhaps his presence gave the evening its peculiar quality of oppressiveness—it stands out in my memory from Gatsby’s other parties that summer.There were the same people, or at least the same sort of people, the same profusion of champagne, the same many-colored, many-keyed commotion, but I felt an unpleasantness in the air, a pervading harshness that hadn’t been there before.Or perhaps I had merely grown used to it, grown to accept West Egg as a world complete in itself, with its own standards and its own great figures, second to nothing because it had no consciousness of being so, and now I was looking at it again, through Daisy’s eyes.It is invariably saddening to look through new eyes at things upon which you have expended your own powers of adjustment."
"他们在黄昏时分到来，当我们在那数百位满身珠光宝气的客人中漫步时，黛西又玩起了她那种柔声细语的功夫。","They arrived at twilight and as we strolled out among the sparkling hundreds Daisy’s voice was playing murmurous tricks in her throat."
"“这些东西让我好兴奋啊。”她低声说道，“今晚不管什么时候，你要是想吻我了，尼克，你就告诉我，我会很开心地为你安排。只要叫我的名字就好。或者出示一张绿色的卡片。我正在散发绿色的……”","‘These things excite me SO,’ she whispered.‘If you want to kiss me any time during the evening, Nick, just let me know and I’ll be glad to arrange it for you.Just mention my name.Or present a green card.I’m giving out green—’"
"“向四周看一下。”盖茨比提议说。","‘Look around,’ suggested Gatsby."
"“我正在向四周看啊。我真的是开心极……”","‘I’m looking around.I’m having a marvelous—’"
"“你一定能看到许多你已久闻大名的人物的面孔。”","‘You must see the faces of many people you’ve heard about.’"
"汤姆傲慢地朝人群扫视了一眼。","Tom’s arrogant eyes roamed the crowd."
"“我们平时不怎么外出。”他说，“事实上我刚刚就在想，这里我一个人都不认识。”","‘We don’t go around very much,’ he said.‘In fact I was just thinking I don’t know a soul here.’"
"“或许你认识那位女士吧。”盖茨比指着一位貌似天仙的美女，她静静地坐在一棵白色的梅子树下。汤姆和黛西目不转睛地盯着她，当他们认出来那就是当下银幕上幽灵般的明星大腕儿时，竟流露出一种难以置信的表情。","‘Perhaps you know that lady.’Gatsby indicated a gorgeous, scarcely human orchid of a woman who sat in state under a white plum tree.Tom and Daisy stared, with that peculiarly unreal feeling that accompanies the recognition of a hitherto ghostly celebrity of the movies."
"“她真可爱啊。”黛西说。","‘She’s lovely,’ said Daisy."
"“在她身边弯着腰的那个男士就是她的导演。”","‘The man bending over her is her director.’"
"他带着他们，非常正式地向一群又一群客人介绍：“这位是布坎南夫人……这位是布坎南先生——”迟疑片刻后，他又补充道，“马球健将。”","He took them ceremoniously from group to group: ‘Mrs. Buchanan... and Mr. Buchanan—’ After an instant’s hesitation he added: ‘the polo player.’"
"“不是的，”汤姆连忙否认说，“我并不是。”","‘Oh no,’ objected Tom quickly, ‘Not me.’"
"盖茨比显然是十分喜欢这个称谓，因为从那时开始，汤姆一晚上都被称作是“马球健将”。","But evidently the sound of it pleased Gatsby for Tom remained ‘the polo player’ for the rest of the evening."
"“我从来都没见过这么多的社会名流！”黛西大声感叹道，“我喜欢那个男的——他叫什么名字呢？——就是鼻子有点发青的那个。”","‘I’ve never met so many celebrities!’Daisy exclaimed.‘I liked that man—what was his name?—with the sort of blue nose.’"
"盖茨比说出了那人的名字，并补充说他是一个小小的制片商。","Gatsby identified him, adding that he was a small producer."
"“哦，反正我就是喜欢他。”","‘Well, I liked him anyhow.’"
"“我倒宁愿不做什么马球健将，”汤姆开心地说，“我情愿以……以一个无名小卒的身份来默默地观察这些名人。”","‘I’d a little rather not be the polo player,’ said Tom pleasantly, ‘I’d rather look at all these famous people in—in oblivion.’"
"黛西和盖茨比跳起舞来。我还记得自己当时被他那优雅而老套的狐步给惊呆了——我以前从来没有见过他跳舞。随后他们一起漫步来到我家，在台阶上坐了半个小时，而我却应她的要求在花园里望风。“万一有什么火灾或洪水，”她解释说，“或是什么其他的天灾啦。”","Daisy and Gatsby danced.I remember being surprised by his graceful, conservative fox-trot—I had never seen him dance before.Then they sauntered over to my house and sat on the steps for half an hour while at her request I remained watchfully in the garden: ‘In case there’s a fire or a flood,’ she explained, ‘or any act of God.’"
"我们坐下来正准备一起吃晚饭，汤姆又不声不响地冒了出来。“我和那边的几个人一起吃饭，你们不介意吧？”他说道，“那家伙正在讲一些非常有意思的东西。”","Tom appeared from his oblivion as we were sitting down to supper together.‘Do you mind if I eat with some people over here?’ he said.‘A fellow’s getting off some funny stuff.’"
"“去吧，”黛西和颜悦色地回答，“而且你要是想记下什么地址的话，给你用我的小金铅笔。”……过了一会儿，她四周环顾了一下对我说，那个女孩“俗气，却很漂亮”，于是我明白了，除了和盖茨比单独呆在一起的半个小时之外，她一直玩得并不开心。我们这桌的人个个都是烂醉如泥。这都怪我不好——盖茨比被叫去接电话了，而两周前我还和这些人在一起玩得挺开心的。但是当初我觉得很有趣的东西，现在突然变得索然无味了。","‘Go ahead,’ answered Daisy genially, ‘And if you want to take down any addresses here’s my little gold pencil.’—— She looked around after a moment and told me the girl was ‘common but pretty,’ and I knew that except for the half hour she’d been alone with Gatsby she wasn’t having a good time.We were at a particularly tipsy table.That was my fault—Gatsby had been called to the phone and I’d enjoyed these same people only two weeks before.But what had amused me then turned septic on the air now."
"“感觉怎么样？贝达克小姐？”","‘How do you feel, Miss Baedeker?’"
"被问话的这位小姐正想慢慢倒下靠在我的肩膀上，但没有靠上。听到问话，她坐了起来，睁开了眼睛。","The girl addressed was trying, unsuccessfully, to slump against my shoulder.At this inquiry she sat up and opened her eyes."
"“什么？”","‘What?’"
"一个身材肥大、昏昏欲睡的女的，刚才还一直怂恿黛西明天和她一起去当地的俱乐部打高尔夫，现在出来为贝达克小姐说话了。","A massive and lethargic woman, who had been urging Daisy to play golf with her at the local club tomorrow, spoke in Miss Baedeker’s defence:"
"“噢，她现在已经很好了。她喝上五六杯鸡尾酒的时候，总是那样大喊大叫。我跟她说过，她就应该不喝酒的。”","‘Oh, she’s all right now.When she’s had five or six cocktails she always starts screaming like that.I tell her she ought to leave it alone.’"
"“我是没喝酒啊。”这位被数落的小姐空洞地说道。","‘I do leave it alone,’ affirmed the accused hollowly."
"“我刚听到你大声嚷嚷了，因此我还和希维特大夫说：‘有人需要你的帮助啦，大夫。’”","‘We heard you yelling, so I said to Doc Civet here: ‘There’s somebody that needs your help, Doc.’"
"“我敢肯定她非常感激你。”另外一位朋友很不领情地说道，“但是你将她的头摁到游泳池里的时候，把她的衣服也全部弄湿了。”","‘She’s much obliged, I’m sure,’ said another friend, without gratitude.‘But you got her dress all wet when you stuck her head in the pool.’"
"“我讨厌别人将我的头摁到游泳池里去。”贝达克小姐咕哝着说，“在新泽西那次，他们差点把我给淹死了。”","‘Anything I hate is to get my head stuck in a pool,’ mumbled Miss Baedeker.‘They almost drowned me once over in New Jersey.’"
"“那你就不应该喝酒。”希维特大夫反驳道。","‘Then you ought to leave it alone,’ countered Doctor Civet."
"“你是在说自己吧！”贝达克小姐凶暴地大吼道，“你的手发抖。我是绝不会让你给我做手术的。”","‘Speak for yourself!’ cried Miss Baedeker violently.‘Your hand shakes.I wouldn’t let you operate on me!’"
"情况就是这样。我记得差不多最后一件事就是和黛西站在一起看着电影导演和他的“大明星”的一举一动。他们依旧呆在白色的梅子树下，脸几乎贴在了一起，中间只隔着一层薄薄的月光。我才想起里，其实他整个晚上都在慢慢弯腰靠近她，直到现在才贴得这么近，而就当我还在注视着的时候，他弯下最后一点距离，亲吻了她的脸颊。","It was like that.Almost the last thing I remember was standing with Daisy and watching the moving picture director and his Star.They were still under the white plum tree and their faces were touching except for a pale thin ray of moonlight between.It occurred to me that he had been very slowly bending toward her all evening to attain this proximity, and even while I watched I saw him stoop one ultimate degree and kiss at her cheek."
"“我喜欢她，”黛西说，“我觉得她很可爱。”","‘I like her,’ said Daisy, ‘I think she’s lovely.’"
"但是宴会上的其他一切都让她反感——而且是毋庸质疑的，因为那并不是一种姿态，而是一种情感。整个西卵让她感到无比惊骇，这个由百老汇强加在一个长岛渔村上的前所未有的“胜地”——她惊骇于那种委婉斯文下凸显的野蛮与活力，惊骇于那由突兀的命运指引着当地居民沿着捷径的追寻，可到头来却是一无所获。在那种她一直不解的单纯之中，她看到了一种可怕的东西。","But the rest offended her—and inarguably, because it wasn’t a gesture but an emotion.She was appalled by West Egg, this unprecedented ‘place’ that Broadway had begotten upon a Long Island fishing village—appalled by its raw vigor that chafed under the old euphemisms and by the too obtrusive fate that herded its inhabitants along a short cut from nothing to nothing.She saw something awful in the very simplicity she failed to understand."
"他们在等车子的时候，我同他们一块坐在前门的台阶上。前面一片漆黑，只有敞开的大门射出来十平方英尺的亮光，融进了幽暗的黎明。有时楼上化妆间的遮帘上会有一个身影走过，然后又是另外一个身影，女客们影影绰绰的身影对着一面从外面看不见的镜子涂脂抹粉。","I sat on the front steps with them while they waited for their car.It was dark here in front: only the bright door sent ten square feet of light volleying out into the soft black morning.Sometimes a shadow moved against a dressing-room blind above, gave way to another shadow, an indefinite procession of shadows, who rouged and powdered in an invisible glass."
"“这个盖茨比到底是什么人啊？”汤姆突然问道，“是一个大走私贩吗？”","‘Who is this Gatsby anyhow?’ demanded Tom suddenly.‘Some big bootlegger?’"
"“你是哪儿听说的？”我问道。","‘Where’d you hear that?’I inquired."
"“我没听谁说。我自己猜测的。当今很多的此类暴发户都只是些大走私贩，你也知道的。”","‘I didn’t hear it.I imagined it.A lot of these newly rich people are just big bootleggers, you know.’"
"“盖茨比可不是。”我简短地说。他沉默了片刻。车道上的小石头在他的脚下嘎嘎吱吱地响。","‘Not Gatsby,’ I said shortly.He was silent for a moment.The pebbles of the drive crunched under his feet."
"“哦，他一定费了不少劲儿才请来这么一帮乌合之众吧。”","‘Well, he certainly must have strained himself to get this menagerie together.’"
"一阵微风将黛西毛茸茸的灰皮领子吹得微微颤动。","A breeze stirred the grey haze of Daisy’s fur collar."
"“至少他们比我们认识的那些人有趣得多。”她有点勉强地说道。","‘At least they’re more interesting than the people we know,’ she said with an effort."
"“你看上去也并不是多么感兴趣啊。”","‘You didn’t look so interested.’"
"“不，我很感兴趣。”","‘Well, I was.’"
"汤姆笑着转过来看着我说：","Tom laughed and turned to me."
"“当那个女孩让黛西给她冲个冷水澡的时候，你有没有注意黛西的脸？”","‘Did you notice Daisy’s face when that girl asked her to put her under a cold shower?’"
"黛西开始跟着音乐低声唱起歌来，声音沙哑而有节奏，唱出了每个字独特的含义，这种含义以前不曾有过，以后也不会再有。当旋律升高的时候，她的声音也非常悠扬地跟着上扬，非常纯正的女低音，每一点声音的变化都在向空气中散发着她那温情脉脉的魅力。","Daisy began to sing with the music in a husky, rhythmic whisper, bringing out a meaning in each word that it had never had before and would never have again.When the melody rose, her voice broke up sweetly, following it, in a way contralto voices have, and each change tipped out a little of her warm human magic upon the air."
"“很多到这儿的人并没有被邀请。”黛西突然说道，“那个女孩就没被邀请。他们是自己闯来的，而他又很客气，不好意思拒绝他们。”","‘Lots of people come who haven’t been invited,’ she said suddenly.‘That girl hadn’t been invited.They simply force their way in and he’s too polite to object.’"
"“我很想知道他到底是什么人，干什么的。”汤姆固执地说，“而且我觉得自己一定会打听清楚的。”","‘I’d like to know who he is and what he does,’ insisted Tom.‘And I think I’ll make a point of finding out.’"
"“我现在就可以告诉你。”她回答说，“他是开药店的，有很多家的药店。这都是他一手创办起来的。”","‘I can tell you right now,’ she answered.‘He owned some drug stores, a lot of drug stores.He built them up himself.’"
"他们的豪华轿车不紧不慢地沿着车道开了过来。","The dilatory limousine came rolling up the drive."
"“晚安，尼克。”黛西说。","‘Good night, Nick,’ said Daisy."
"她的目光瞥过我朝着灯光照耀着的最上层台阶望去，在那里一只高雅而伤感的当年流行的华尔兹舞曲《凌晨三点钟》正穿过敞开的大门传来。毕竟，在盖茨的宴会那种随意轻松的氛围中，才有可能找到一种她的世界里完全没有的浪漫。而歌曲里仿佛有一种东西在召唤着她回去。在这昏暗却又无法预知的时刻，到底会发生什么样的事情呢？也许会有某位难以置信的客人，一位不同寻常且令人惊叹不已的客人，某位真正活力四射的少女，她只要看上一眼盖茨比，在两人目光交织的神奇的一刹那，五年坚贞不渝的爱情就会被一笔勾销。","Her glance left me and sought the lighted top of the steps where ‘Three o’Clock in the Morning,’ a neat, sad little waltz of that year, was drifting out the open door.After all, in the very casualness of Gatsby’s party there were romantic possibilities totally absent from her world.What was it up there in the song that seemed to be calling her back inside?What would happen now in the dim incalculable hours?Perhaps some unbelievable guest would arrive, a person infinitely rare and to be marvelled at, some authentically radiant young girl who with one fresh glance at Gatsby, one moment of magical encounter, would blot out those five years of unwavering devotion."
"那天晚上我呆到了很晚。盖茨比要我等着他闲下来，于是我在花园里到处走，直到最后一帮游泳的客人像往常一样从黑黢黢的海滩跑了回来，浑身哆嗦却又兴致勃勃，直到楼上客房里的灯都熄了。最后他走下台阶的时候，他脸上那晒得黝黑的皮肤比往常绷得更紧了，眼睛明亮却略带疲惫。","I stayed late that night.Gatsby asked me to wait until he was free and I lingered in the garden until the inevitable swimming party had run up, chilled and exalted, from the black beach, until the lights were extinguished in the guest rooms overhead.When he came down the steps at last the tanned skin was drawn unusually tight on his face, and his eyes were bright and tired."
"“她不喜欢这个聚会。”他立刻说道。","‘She didn’t like it,’ he said immediately."
"“她当然喜欢了。”","‘Of course she did.’"
"“她并不喜欢。”他坚持说道，“她玩得并不开心。”","‘She didn’t like it,’ he insisted.‘She didn’t have a good time.’"
"他沉默了，我猜想他有着一种说不出的沮丧。","He was silent and I guessed at his unutterable depression."
"“我感到和她的距离很遥远。”他说，“很难让她理解。”","‘I feel far away from her,’ he said.‘It’s hard to make her understand.’"
"“你是说舞会吗？”","‘You mean about the dance?’"
"“舞会？”他弹了一个响指，一下将他举办过的所有舞会都否定了。“老兄，舞会并不重要。”他所期望的无非只是黛西能够跑到汤姆跟前和他说句“我从来就没爱过你。”等到她用这句话将三年的婚姻一笔勾销之后，他们就可以决定采取下一步更实际的行动。其中之一就是在她从婚姻从解放出来后，他们就回到路易斯维尔，让她重新从家里出嫁——就像时间倒回了五年前一样。","‘The dance?’He dismissed all the dances he had given with a snap of his fingers.‘Old sport, the dance is unimportant.’He wanted nothing less of Daisy than that she should go to Tom and say: ‘I never loved you.’After she had obliterated three years with that sentence they could decide upon the more practical measures to be taken.One of them was that, after she was free, they were to go back to Louisville and be married from her house—just as if it were five years ago."
"“而她却并不理解。”他说，“她以前是能够理解的。我们常常在一起一坐就是几个小时……”","‘And she doesn’t understand,’ he said.‘She used to be able to understand.We’d sit for hours—’"
"他忽然停住不说了，开始沿着一条荒芜的小路来回地走动，小路上面满是果皮、丢弃的小礼物和被践踏的残花。","He broke off and began to walk up and down a desolate path of fruit rinds and discarded favors and crushed flowers."
"“我看还是不要对她要求太高。”我冒昧地说，“你是不可能让过去重现的。”","‘I wouldn’t ask too much of her,’ I ventured.‘You can’t repeat the past.’"
"“不能让过去重现？”他非常怀疑地大声喊道，“怎么就不能，当然能了！”","‘Can’t repeat the past?’ he cried incredulously.‘Why of course you can!’"
"他狂躁地朝四周张望着，似乎过去就藏在这房子的影子里，却怎么也够不到。","He looked around him wildly, as if the past were lurking here in the shadow of his house, just out of reach of his hand."
"“我要将一切都恢复到过去的模样。”他说着非常坚决地点了点头，“她会看到的。”","‘I’m going to fix everything just the way it was before,’ he said, nodding determinedly.‘She’ll see.’"
"他说了一大堆过去的事情，我推测他是想重新得到什么东西，也许是想找回某种念头，让他再次进入到对黛西的热恋中。从此以后，他的生活一直都是杂乱无章，但如果他能重新回到某个起点，然后慢慢地重新再走一遍，也许他会发现那到底是什么东西……","He talked a lot about the past and I gathered that he wanted to recover something, some idea of himself perhaps, that had gone into loving Daisy.His life had been confused and disordered since then, but if he could once return to a certain starting place and go over it all slowly, he could find out what that thing was...."
"五年前的一个晚上，他们一起走在落叶飘飞的街头，来到一处没有树的地方，人行道在月光下泛着白色的光辉。他们停了下来，转身望着对方。那是一个凉爽的夜晚，是一年中换季的时节，空气中洋溢着那种令人兴奋的神秘。各家各户的屋子里发出的静谧的灯光正在对着夜的黑暗吟唱，天上的繁星熙熙攘攘、躁动不安。盖茨比用眼角的余光看到人行道两边的街区其实形成了一架梯子，梯子向上通向树上一个神秘的地方——他可以爬上去，如果他独自攀爬的话，他可以吮吸生命的乳汁，大口吞下那无与伦比的神奇汁液。","... One autumn night, five years before, they had been walking down the street when the leaves were falling, and they came to a place where there were no trees and the sidewalk was white with moonlight.They stopped here and turned toward each other.Now it was a cool night with that mysterious excitement in it which comes at the two changes of the year.The quiet lights in the houses were humming out into the darkness and there was a stir and bustle among the stars.Out of the corner of his eye Gatsby saw that the blocks of the sidewalk really formed a ladder and mounted to a secret place above the trees—he could climb to it, if he climbed alone, and once there he could suck on the pap of life, gulp down the incomparable milk of wonder."
"当黛西白皙的脸贴近他的脸的时候，他的心跳越来越快。他明白，在他亲吻这个女孩的时候，他那无以言表的憧憬就会同她那脆弱的呼吸永远地结合在一起，而他的心灵也将永远不会再像上帝的心灵那样肆意驰骋。因此他等了一会儿，倾听着那已经在一颗星星上敲响的音叉。而后他吻了她。他的唇一碰到她，她便像花一样为他绽放开来，于是一个理想的化身就完成了。","His heart beat faster and faster as Daisy’s white face came up to his own.He knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again like the mind of God.So he waited, listening for a moment longer to the tuning fork that had been struck upon a star.Then he kissed her.At his lips’ touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the incarnation was complete."
"他的这一番描述，甚至还有那种令人惊讶的情愫，让我想起了一些什么……很久以前我在什么地方听到的一曲难以捉摸的旋律，还有零零碎碎的几句歌词。有一会儿，一句话似乎到了我的嘴边，我像哑巴一样张开双唇，好像除了一丝受惊的空气，还有些什么在挣扎着出来。但是我的双唇没发出任何声响，因此那些回忆起来的东西也就永远无法表达出来了。","Through all he said, even through his appalling sentimentality, I was reminded of something—an elusive rhythm, a fragment of lost words, that I had heard somewhere a long time ago.For a moment a phrase tried to take shape in my mouth and my lips parted like a dumb man’s, as though there was more struggling upon them than a wisp of startled air.But they made no sound and what I had almost remembered was uncommunicable forever."
"第七章","Chapter 7"
"当人们对盖茨比的好奇心达到最高点的时候，一个星期六的晚上，他的别墅却没有像往常那样灯火通明——他像古罗马的特里马尔奇奥那样大宴宾客的生涯就此结束，这种结束就如同当初开始时那般莫名其妙。","It was when curiosity about Gatsby was at its highest that the lights in his house failed to go on one Saturday night—and, as obscurely as it had begun, his career as Tri-malchio was over."
"只是渐渐地，我发现那些乘兴而来的汽车开进车道没一会儿就扫兴而归了。我担心他是否是生病了，便去他家看看究竟是怎么回事——一个陌生的男管家满脸凶相地站在门口，斜起眼睛满腹狐疑地看着我。“盖茨比先生生病了吗？”","Only gradually did I become aware that the automobiles which turned expectantly into his drive stayed for just a minute and then drove sulkily away.Wondering if he were sick I went over to find out—an unfamiliar butler with a villainous face squinted at me suspiciously from the door.‘Is Mr. Gatsby sick?’"
"“没有。”停了一会儿，他又慢吞吞且很不情愿地加了一句“先生”。","‘Nope.’After a pause he added ‘sir’ in a dilatory, grudging way."
"“我很久没见他出来了，很是担心。你告诉他卡拉韦先生过来了。”“谁？”他粗鲁地问道。“卡拉韦。”","‘I hadn’t seen him around, and I was rather worried.Tell him Mr. Carraway came over.’‘Who?’ he demanded rudely.‘Carraway.’"
"“卡拉韦。好吧，我去告诉他。”他猛地将门砰的一声关上了。","‘Carraway.All right, I’ll tell him.’Abruptly he slammed the door."
"我的芬兰女佣告诉我说盖茨比在一周前就辞退了家里所有的佣人，而且又雇了六个，这些新雇的佣人从来都不去西卵村被商贩们贿赂，他们只是通过电话订购适量的日用品。杂货店送货的小伙说他的厨房看起来像个猪圈，而镇上人们一般都认为他新雇的那些人根本就不是佣人。第二天盖茨比就给我打电话了。“想出门走走吗？”我问道。“不想，老兄。”","My Finn informed me that Gatsby had dismissed every servant in his house a week ago and replaced them with half a dozen others, who never went into West Egg Village to be bribed by the tradesmen, but ordered moderate supplies over the telephone.The grocery boy reported that the kitchen looked like a pigsty, and the general opinion in the village was that the new people weren’t servants at all.Next day Gatsby called me on the phone.‘Going away?’I inquired.‘No, old sport.’"
"“我听说你辞掉了所有的佣人。”","‘I hear you fired all your servants.’"
"“我想雇些不会嚼舌头的人。黛西经常过来——下午的时候。”","‘I wanted somebody who wouldn’t gossip.Daisy comes over quite often—in the afternoons.’"
"原来是因为黛西的否定，使得这座大酒店像纸牌房子一般轰然坍塌。","So the whole caravansary had fallen in like a card house at the disapproval in her eyes."
"“沃尔夫山姆想帮他们的忙，于是就叫他们过来了。他们都是兄弟姐妹。他们以前经营一家小旅店。”","‘They’re some people Wolfshiem wanted to do something for.They’re all brothers and sisters.They used to run a small hotel.’"
"“我明白了。”","‘I see.’"
"他是应黛西的要求给我打电话的——问我明天是否愿意去她家里吃午饭。贝克小姐也会去的。半个小时之后，黛西亲自打电话过来了。得知我要过去，她好像松了一口气。一定是出什么事了。但是我万万没想到他们竟然选择了这个场合来大闹一场——特别是先前盖茨比在花园里描述过的那种难堪的场景。","He was calling up at Daisy’s request—would I come to lunch at her house tomorrow?Miss Baker would be there.Half an hour later Daisy herself telephoned and seemed relieved to find that I was coming.Something was up.And yet I couldn’t believe that they would choose this occasion for a scene—especially for the rather harrowing scene that Gatsby had outlined in the garden."
"第二天天气酷热难耐，虽说夏天已将近结束，但这无疑是夏季里最热的一天。当我乘坐的火车穿过隧道驶入阳光下时，只能听到国家饼干公司尖锐的汽笛声，将中午闷热的静寂划破。车座上的草垫子烫得快要着火了，我旁边的一位女士的汗水已经浸湿了她的衬衫，但她依旧很文雅地坐着。不料过了一会儿，她拿着的报纸也在手指中间变湿了，于是她郁闷地叹了口气，非常无奈地向后倒在炙热的靠背上。她的钱包啪的一声就掉在了地上。“哦，天哪！”她喘着气说道。","The next day was broiling, almost the last, certainly the warmest, of the summer.As my train emerged from the tunnel into sunlight, only the hot whistles of the National Biscuit Company broke the simmering hush at noon.The straw seats of the car hovered on the edge of combustion; the woman next to me perspired delicately for a while into her white shirtwaist, and then, as her newspaper dampened under her fingers, lapsed despairingly into deep heat with a desolate cry.Her pocket-book slapped to the floor.‘Oh, my!’ she gasped."
"我慵懒地弯腰捡了起来，轻轻地捏着钱包的一角，将手伸得长长的，把钱包还给了她，以示我无任何贪念——但是我周边的每一个人，包括那个女的在内，依旧有些怀疑我。","I picked it up with a weary bend and handed it back to her, holding it at arm’s length and by the extreme tip of the corners to indicate that I had no designs upon it—but every one near by, including the woman, suspected me just the same."
"“热啊！”售票员对熟客说，“这天气不得了啊！热啊！热啊！热啊！你热得够呛了吧？热吗？热不？”","‘Hot!’ said the conductor to familiar faces.‘Some weather!Hot!Hot!Hot!Is it hot enough for you?Is it hot?Is it.?’"
"他将月票递还给我，上面用手抹了一个黑色的汗渍。在这种酷热中，有谁还在乎自己吻的是谁的红唇，或在乎谁的头偎湿了自己睡衣胸前的口袋！","My commutation ticket came back to me with a dark stain from his hand.That any one should care in this heat whose flushed lips he kissed, whose head made damp the pajama pocket over his heart!"
"………盖茨比和我在门口等待开门的时候，一阵电话声从布坎南家的门廊伴着微风传出。","... Through the hall of the Buchanans’ house blew a faint wind, carrying the sound of the telephone bell out to Gatsby and me as we waited at the door."
"“主人的尸体！”男管家朝着话筒吼道，“对不起，太太，我们现在提供不了——中午太热了，没法碰！”","‘The master’s body!’ roared the butler into the mouthpiece.‘I’m sorry, madame, but we can’t furnish it—it’s far too hot to touch this noon!’"
"他实际上讲的是：“好……好……我去看看。”","What he really said was: ‘Yes.yes.I’ll see.’"
"他放下话筒，朝我们走过来，满头是汗，将我们的硬壳草帽接了过去。","He set down the receiver and came toward us, glistening slightly, to take our stiff straw hats."
"“夫人在客厅里等您们呢！”他大声说着，还显得有些多余地向我们示意了一下方向。在这样的酷热中，每一个多余的手势都是在冒犯公共储藏的生命。","‘Madame expects you in the salon!’ he cried, needlessly indicating the direction.In this heat every extra gesture was an affront to the common store of life."
"屋子的外边有遮阳蓬，因此屋内有些阴暗，很凉快。黛西和乔丹躺在一张巨大的沙发上，看上去像两座银像，她们压着自己白色的裙子，以防电扇呼呼的风将它们吹起来。“我们无法动了。”她们同时说道。","The room, shadowed well with awnings, was dark and cool.Daisy and Jordan lay upon an enormous couch, like silver idols, weighing down their own white dresses against the singing breeze of the fans.‘We can’t move,’ they said together."
"乔丹那晒得黝黑的手指上搽了一层白色的粉，她将手在我的手里放了一会儿。","Jordan’s fingers, powdered white over their tan, rested for a moment in mine."
"“我们的运动健将汤姆·布坎南哪儿去了？”我问道。","‘And Mr. Thomas Buchanan, the athlete?’I inquired."
"与此同时，我听到他在门廊里用那粗暴、低沉，却有些沙哑的声音正打着电话。","Simultaneously I heard his voice, gruff, muffled, husky, at the hall telephone."
"盖茨比站在深红色的地毯中央，非常入迷地四处张望。黛西看着他笑起来，那笑声甜美而撩人，还有淡淡的香粉味从她的胸口飘入空气中。","Gatsby stood in the center of the crimson carpet and gazed around with fascinated eyes.Daisy watched him and laughed, her sweet, exciting laugh; a tiny gust of powder rose from her bosom into the air."
"“有谣言说，”乔丹低声说，“电话那头是汤姆的情人。”","‘The rumor is,’ whispered Jordan, ‘that that’s Tom’s girl on the telephone.’"
"我们都沉默了。门廊里的声音高了起来，听起来有点气恼：“那好，那么，我肯定不会把车子卖给你……","We were silent.The voice in the hall rose high with annoyance.‘Very well, then, I won’t sell you the car at all____"
"我压根儿就不欠你什么……至于你在午饭的时候为这点事烦我，我根本就无法忍受！”","I’m under no obligations to you at all____And as for your bothering me about it at lunch time I won’t stand that at all!’"
"“挂着话筒说话了吧。”黛西冷嘲热讽地说。","‘Holding down the receiver,’ said Daisy cynically."
"“不，他没有。”我向她肯定道，“确实有这么一笔交易。我碰巧也知道这件事情。”","‘No, he’s not,’ I assured her.‘It’s a bona fide deal.I happen to know about it.’"
"汤姆猛然推开了门，他那壮实的身体在门口堵了会儿，他便匆匆走进屋内：","Tom flung open the door, blocked out its space for a moment with his thick body, and hurried into the room."
"“盖茨比先生！”他伸出那宽大扁平的手，巧妙地掩饰了对他的厌恶之情，“很高兴见到您，先生……尼克………”","‘Mr. Gatsby!’He put out his broad, flat hand with well-concealed dislike.‘I’m glad to see you, sir_.Nick_.’"
"“给我们倒杯冷饮来。”黛西嚷道。","‘Make us a cold drink,’ cried Daisy."
"汤姆再次离开屋子后，她便站起来走到盖茨比面前，扳下他的脸，对着他的嘴唇吻了一下。","As he left the room again she got up and went over to Gatsby and pulled his face down kissing him on the mouth."
"“你知道，我爱你。”她轻声说道。“你忘了还有一位女士在场呢。”乔丹说。黛西故意装作很疑惑的样子向四周看了看：“那你亲吻尼克好了。”“多么低级、庸俗的女孩啊！”","‘You know I love you,’ she murmured.‘You forget there’s a lady present,’ said Jordan.Daisy looked around doubtfully.‘You kiss Nick too.’‘What a low, vulgar girl!’"
"“我不在乎啊！”黛西一边大声说着，一边开始在砖砌的壁炉前跳起舞来。随后她想起来外边天气正炎热，便很难为情地坐在了沙发上。这时一个收拾得干净整齐的保姆领着一个小女孩走进屋来。","‘I don’t care!’ cried Daisy and began to clog on the brick fireplace.Then she remembered the heat and sat down guiltily on the couch just as a freshly laundered nurse leading a little girl came into the room."
"“亲爱的——宝贝。”她一边伸出双臂，一边轻声温柔地说，“来妈妈这儿，妈妈爱你。”","‘Bles-sed pre-cious,’ she crooned, holding out her arms.‘Come to your own mother that loves you.’"
"保姆一松手，小孩便从屋子那头跑过来，羞答答地一头栽进母亲的衣裙里。","The child, relinquished by the nurse, rushed across the room and rooted shyly into her mother’s dress."
"“亲爱的，宝贝！妈妈是不是把粉弄到你的黄发上啦？来，站起来，和大家说声——你好。”","‘The Bles-sed pre-cious!Did mother get powder on your old yellowy hair?Stand up now, and say How-de-do.’"
"盖茨比和我先后弯下腰，握了握那只勉强伸出来的小手。随后他便一直用一种惊讶的目光盯着小孩看。我觉得他以前真的从来没有相信过这个小孩的存在。","Gatsby and I in turn leaned down and took the small reluctant hand.Afterward he kept looking at the child with surprise.I don’t think he had ever really believed in its existence before."
"“我在午饭前就穿好衣服啦。”小孩说着热切地将脸转向黛西。","‘I got dressed before luncheon,’ said the child, turning eagerly to Daisy."
"“那是因为妈妈想让你表现一下。”她低头将脸伏在孩子雪白的小脖子上的那道颈纹里，“你呀，你这个小天使。你真是个天使般的小宝贝。”","‘That’s because your mother wanted to show you off.’Her face bent into the single wrinkle of the small white neck.‘You dream, you.You absolute little dream.’"
"“是啊。”孩子平静地应答道，“乔丹阿姨也穿了一条白色的裙子。”","‘Yes,’ admitted the child calmly.‘Aunt Jordan’s got on a white dress too.’"
"“你喜不喜欢妈妈的朋友啊？”黛西将她的身子转过来，让她面向盖茨比，“你觉得他们漂亮吗？”","‘How do you like mother’s friends?’Daisy turned her around so that she faced Gatsby.‘Do you think they’re pretty?’"
"“爸爸哪儿去了？”“她长得不像她爸爸。”黛西解释说，“她长得像我。她的头发和脸型都像我。”","‘Where’s Daddy?’‘She doesn’t look like her father,’ explained Daisy.‘She looks like me.She’s got my hair and shape of the face.’"
"黛西身子往后靠在了沙发上。保姆向前跨了一步，伸出手来：","Daisy sat back upon the couch.The nurse took a step forward and held out her hand."
"“来，帕米。”","‘Come, Pammy.’"
"“再见，宝贝！”","‘Goodbye, sweetheart!’"
"孩子依依不舍地回头看了一眼，然后非常懂事地抓着保姆的手，被拉到了门外。这时刚好汤姆回来了，后面的佣人跟着端来四杯杜松子利克酒，里面装满的冰块叮当作响。","With a reluctant backward glance the well-disciplined child held to her nurse’s hand and was pulled out the door, just as Tom came back, preceding four gin rickeys that clicked full of ice."
"盖茨比端起一杯酒来。","Gatsby took up his drink."
"“这酒看着就够凉的。”他带着一种显而易见的紧张神情说道。","‘They certainly look cool,’ he said, with visible tension."
"我们都急不可耐地大口大口喝起酒来。","We drank in long greedy swallows."
"“我在某处读到过，说是太阳在逐年变热。”汤姆温和地说，“又说地球好像不久后会掉到太阳里去——等会儿——是恰恰相反——太阳在逐年变冷。”","‘I read somewhere that the sun’s getting hotter every year,’ said Tom genially.‘It seems that pretty soon the earth’s going to fall into the sun—or wait a minute—it’s just the opposite—the sun’s getting colder every year."
"“出去吧，”他向盖茨比提议说，“我想请你看看我这儿。”","‘Come outside,’ he suggested to Gatsby, ‘I’d like you to have a look at the place.’"
"我同他们一起来到外边的阳台上。碧绿的海水在炎热中停止不动，海面上一条小帆慢吞吞地驶向新的海域。盖茨比的目光时刻跟着小船移动。他举起手指着海湾的对岸：","I went with them out to the veranda.On the green Sound, stagnant in the heat, one small sail crawled slowly toward the fresher sea.Gatsby’s eyes followed it momentarily; he raised his hand and pointed across the bay."
"“我就在你们的对岸。”","‘I’m right across from you.’"
"“可不是嘛。”","‘So you are.’"
"我们的视线扫过玫瑰花圃；扫过发烫的草坪；扫过海岸边暴露在烈日下的杂草丛。小船白色的船翼慢慢地驶向清凉的蔚蓝色天际。前面就是碧波荡漾的海洋，还有那星罗棋布的宝岛。","Our eyes lifted over the rosebeds and the hot lawn and the weedy refuse of the dog days along shore.Slowly the white wings of the boat moved against the blue cool limit of the sky.Ahead lay the scalloped ocean and the abounding blessed isles."
"“你们可以玩体育项目。”汤姆点头说道，“我很想和他去那边玩上个把钟头。”","‘There’s sport for you,’ said Tom, nodding.‘I’d like to be out there with him for about an hour.’"
"我们在餐室里吃的午餐。与外边的酷热相比，餐室很阴凉。在那里我们喝着凉啤酒，欢笑之中带着几分紧张。","We had luncheon in the dining-room, darkened, too, against the heat, and drank down nervous gayety with the cold ale."
"“我们今天下午怎么打发呢，”黛西大声说道，“还有明天，还有接下来的三十年？”","‘What’ll we do with ourselves this afternoon,’ cried Daisy, ‘and the day after that, and the next thirty years?’"
"“别发神经了。”乔丹说，“秋高气爽的时候，生活便就又重新开始了。”","‘Don’t be morbid,’ Jordan said.‘Life starts all over again when it gets crisp in the fall.’"
"“但是天气这么热，”黛西固执地说，眼泪差点就掉出来了，“而且一切都是乱七八糟的。我们一起进城去吧！”","‘But it’s so hot,’ insisted Daisy, on the verge of tears, ‘And everything’s so confused.Let’s all go to town!’"
"她的声音击打着热浪，在其中挣扎着，将毫无感觉的热浪塑出了形状。","Her voice struggled on through the heat, beating against it, moulding its senselessness into forms."
"“我听说过将马房改成车库的，”汤姆对盖茨比说，“但我却是第一个将车库改成马房的人。”","‘I’ve heard of making a garage out of a stable,’ Tom was saying to Gatsby, ‘but I’m the first man who ever made a stable out of a garage.’"
"“谁想进城去呢？”黛西执拗地问道。盖茨比将目光投向她。“啊，”她大声喊道，“你看起来真酷。”","‘Who wants to go to town?’ demanded Daisy insistently.Gatsby’s eyes floated toward her.‘Ah,’ she cried, ‘you look so cool.’"
"他们的目光相遇了，于是便目不转睛地盯着彼此，好像那儿只有他们两个人似的。黛西很不情愿地将目光转移到了桌子上。","Their eyes met, and they stared together at each other, alone in space.With an effort she glanced down at the table."
"“你总是看起来那么酷。”她又说了一遍。","‘You always look so cool,’ she repeated."
"她已经是在告诉他她爱他了，汤姆·布坎南也看出来了。他被惊呆了。他将嘴微微张开，然后看了看盖茨比，又看了看黛西，似乎他刚刚意识到她原来是自己很久以前就认识的人。","She had told him that she loved him, and Tom Buchanan saw.He was astounded.His mouth opened a little and he looked at Gatsby and then back at Daisy as if he had just recognized her as some one he knew a long time ago."
"“你很像广告里的那个男的。”她毫无察觉地继续说道，“你知道那个人拍的广告……”","‘You resemble the advertisement of the man,’ she went on innocently.‘You know the advertisement of the man—’"
"“好吧，”汤姆立刻打断她说道，“我非常赞同去城里。走吧——我们大家一起进城去。”","‘All right,’ broke in Tom quickly, ‘I’m perfectly willing to go to town.Come on—we’re all going to town.’"
"他站了起来，目光依旧在盖茨比和他的妻子之间飘来飘去。并没有人动。","He got up, his eyes still flashing between Gatsby and his wife.No one moved."
"“走啊！”他有点发火了，“到底怎么回事啊？我们要是进城的话，那就动身啊。”","‘Come on!’His temper cracked a little.‘What’s the matter, anyhow?If we’re going to town let’s start.’"
"他尽量控制住自己颤抖的双手，端起杯子，将剩下的啤酒一饮而尽。黛西招呼大家站起来，来到外面滚烫的石子车道上。","His hand, trembling with his effort at self control, bore to his lips the last of his glass of ale.Daisy’s voice got us to our feet and out on to the blazing gravel drive."
"“我们现在就走吗？”她非常不赞同地问，“就这样走？我们难道不先让大家抽支烟吗？”","‘Are we just going to go?’ she objected.‘Like this?Aren’t we going to let any one smoke a cigarette first?’"
"“大家吃午饭的时候一直在抽烟。”","‘Everybody smoked all through lunch.’"
"“噢，我们开心点儿玩吧。”黛西恳求道，“天气这么热，别闹了。”","‘Oh, let’s have fun,’ she begged him.‘It’s too hot to fuss.’"
"他没有回答。","He didn’t answer."
"“随便你了。”黛西说道，“来吧，乔丹。”","‘Have it your own way,’ she said.‘Come on, Jordan.’"
"她们上楼去准备了，而我们三个大男人站在那儿，用脚踢着滚烫的石头。西方的天空已经挂起了一弯银月。盖茨比刚想开口说话，却又改变了主意，要闭嘴时，却不料汤姆转过身来期待地望着他。","They went upstairs to get ready while we three men stood there shuffling the hot pebbles with our feet.A silver curve of the moon hovered already in the western sky.Gatsby started to speak, changed his mind, but not before Tom wheeled and faced him expectantly."
"“你的马房在这儿吗？”盖茨比吃力地问道。","‘Have you got your stables here?’ asked Gatsby with an effort."
"“沿这条路走四分之一英里就到。”","‘About a quarter of a mile down the road.’"
"“哦。”","‘Oh.’"
"沉默了一会儿。","A pause."
"“我就不理解为什么非要进城去。”汤姆突然粗鲁地说，“女人总是心血来潮……”","‘I don’t see the idea of going to town,’ broke out Tom savagely.‘Women get these notions in their heads—’"
"“我们要不要带点东西喝？”黛西在楼上的窗口喊道。","‘Shall we take anything to drink?’ called Daisy from an upper window."
"“我去拿点威士忌来。”汤姆回答说。他走到屋里去了。","‘I’ll get some whiskey,’ answered Tom.He went inside."
"盖茨比非常僵硬地转过来看着我。","Gatsby turned to me rigidly:"
"“在他的家里我什么也不能说，老兄。”","‘I can’t say anything in his house, old sport.’"
"“她说话很不慎重。”我说道，“话里都是……”","‘She’s got an indiscreet voice,’ I remarked.‘It’s full of—’"
"我犹豫了。","I hesitated."
"“她的话里都是金钱味。”他突然说道。","‘Her voice is full of money,’ he said suddenly."
"正是如此。我以前从来没有体会到。她的话里是充满了金钱味——这正是她那抑扬顿挫、清脆悦耳、铙钹齐鸣般的声音其中无穷的魅力之所在……仿佛一所高高的白色宫殿里面国王的女儿，黄金女郎……","That was it.I’d never understood before.It was full of money—that was the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of it, the cymbals’ song of it_.High in a white palace the king’s daughter, the golden girl_."
"汤姆从屋里面出来了，手里用毛巾包着一瓶一夸脱的酒，后面跟着黛西和乔丹，她们戴着金属布做成的又小又紧的帽子，手臂上搭着薄薄的披肩。","Tom came out of the house wrapping a quart bottle in a towel, followed by Daisy and Jordan wearing small tight hats of metallic cloth and carrying light capes over their arms."
"“大家一起坐我的车走可以吗？”盖茨比提议说。他用手摸了摸发烫的绿皮车座，“我本该把车停在树阴里的。”","‘Shall we all go in my car?’ suggested Gatsby.He felt the hot, green leather of the seat.‘I ought to have left it in the shade.’"
"“这车是标准排档吗？”汤姆问道。","‘Is it standard shift?’ demanded Tom."
"“是的。”","‘Yes.’"
"“好，那你开我的小轿车，我来开你的车进城。”","‘Well, you take my coupé and let me drive your car to town.’"
"这个提议可不符合盖茨比的口味。","The suggestion was distasteful to Gatsby."
"“我想没多少汽油了。”他表示不赞同。","‘I don’t think there’s much gas,’ he objected."
"“汽油多得很。”汤姆粗声说道。他看了看油表：“而且如果油真的用完了，我可以找个药店停下来。这年头药店里什么东西都可以买得到。”","‘Plenty of gas,’ said Tom boisterously.He looked at the gauge.‘And if it runs out I can stop at a drug store.You can buy anything at a drug store nowadays.’"
"听了这句毫无意义的话，大家都没出声。黛西皱着眉头看着汤姆，而盖茨比的脸上却浮现出一种难以形容的表情，这种表情既陌生却又似曾相识，仿佛我只是以前听别人口头描述过一般。","A pause followed this apparently pointless remark.Daisy looked at Tom frowning and an indefinable expression, at once definitely unfamiliar and vaguely recognizable, as if I had only heard it described in words, passed over Gatsby’s face."
"“走啊，黛西。”汤姆说着便用手将黛西推向盖茨比的车子，“我带你坐这辆马戏团的大篷车。”","‘Come on, Daisy,’ said Tom, pressing her with his hand toward Gatsby’s car.‘I’ll take you in this circus wagon.’"
"他打开了车门，但是她却从他的臂弯里移了出来。","He opened the door but she moved out from the circle of his arm."
"“你载尼克和乔丹。我们开小轿车在后面跟着你们。”","‘You take Nick and Jordan.We’ll follow you in the coupé.’"
"她走到盖茨比跟前，用手触摸着他的上衣。乔丹和我，还有汤姆上了盖茨比的车，在前排座坐下，汤姆尝试着扳了扳那不是很熟悉的排档，我们便在闷热中冲了出去，将他们远远地甩在了后面。","She walked close to Gatsby, touching his coat with her hand.Jordan and Tom and I got into the front seat of Gats-by’s car, Tom pushed the unfamiliar gears tentatively and we shot off into the oppressive heat leaving them out of sight behind."
"“你们看到没？”汤姆问道。“看到什么？”","‘Did you see that?’ demanded Tom.‘See what?’"
"他用敏锐的目光看着我，已经意识到了乔丹和我一直知道这件事情。","He looked at me keenly, realizing that Jordan and I must have known all along."
"“你们觉得我很傻，是不？”他说，“也许我是有点傻，但是我有一种——近乎是一种第二感，有时这种第二感告诉我该干什么。也许你们不相信这些，但是科学……”","‘You think I’m pretty dumb, don’t you?’ he suggested.‘Perhaps I am, but I have a—almost a second sight, sometimes, that tells me what to do.Maybe you don’t believe that, but science—’"
"他停住不说了。突然他意识到眼下的当务之急，于是便在长篇大论的边缘刹住车。","He paused.The immediate contingency overtook him, pulled him back from the edge of the theoretical abyss."
"“我已经对这个家伙做过了一些调查。”他继续说道，“我本来可以调查得更深入一些的，要是我早点知道……”","‘I’ve made a small investigation of this fellow,’ he continued.‘I could have gone deeper if I’d known—’"
"“你的意思是你去找过巫师？”乔丹幽默地问。“什么？”他疑惑不解地盯着我们，我们俩却在那儿哈哈大笑。“巫师？”","‘Do you mean you’ve been to a medium?’ inquired Jordan humorously.‘What?’Confused, he stared at us as we laughed.‘A medium?’"
"“是关于盖茨比的事。”","‘About Gatsby.’"
"“是关于盖茨比的事！不，我并没有。我说的是我已经对他的过去做过一些调查。”","‘About Gatsby!No, I haven’t.I said I’d been making a small investigation of his past.’"
"“结果你发现他是牛津大学毕业的。”乔丹帮忙说道。","‘And you found he was an Oxford man,’ said Jordan helpfully."
"“牛津大学毕业！”他满口怀疑地说道，“就他那样！看看他穿的那套粉红色的西服。”","‘An Oxford man!’He was incredulous.‘Like hell he is!He wears a pink suit.’"
"“即便如此，他也是牛津毕业的。”","‘Nevertheless he’s an Oxford man.’"
"“新墨西哥州的牛津镇吧，”汤姆轻蔑地哼着鼻子说，“或是类似的地方。”","‘Oxford, New Mexico,’ snorted Tom contemptuously, ‘or something like that.’"
"“我说，汤姆。既然你如此看不起这个人，那当初你为什么要请他吃午饭呢？”乔丹厉声质问道。","‘Listen, Tom.If you’re such a snob, why did you invite him to lunch?’ demanded Jordan crossly."
"“是黛西邀请的他，我们在结婚前她就认识他的——天晓得他们是在哪儿认识的！”","‘Daisy invited him; she knew him before we were married—God knows where!’"
"啤酒劲儿渐渐退去后，大家都变得烦躁起来。我们都意识到了这一点，所以有一会儿，我们谁都没有说话。随后，在路的前方，T.J. 埃克尔堡大夫那褪色的双眼跃入我们的视线，我又想起了盖茨比提醒过的汽油不够的事。","We were all irritable now with the fading ale and, aware of it, we drove for a while in silence.Then as Doctor T. J. Eckleburg’s faded eyes came into sight down the road, I remembered Gatsby’s caution about gasoline."
"“汽油还足够我们开到城里去。”汤姆说。","‘We’ve got enough to get us to town,’ said Tom."
"“但是这儿正好有一家修车厂。”乔丹反对说道，“大热天儿的，我可不想停在半路。”","‘But there’s a garage right here,’ objected Jordan.‘I don’t want to get stalled in this baking heat.’"
"汤姆不耐烦地踩了两边的刹车，车子扬起一阵尘土，我们便猛地停在了威尔森的招牌下。过了一会儿，老板从车库里边走出来，用那深陷的双眼盯着我们的车子看。","Tom threw on both brakes impatiently and we slid to an abrupt dusty stop under Wilson’s sign.After a moment the proprietor emerged from the interior of his establishment and gazed hollow-eyed at the car."
"“给我们加点汽油！”汤姆粗鲁地大声喊道，“你以为我们停在这里是为什么——欣赏风景吗？”“我生病了。”威尔森一动不动地站在那儿说道，“我已经病了一整天了。”","‘Let’s have some gas!’ cried Tom roughly.‘What do you think we stopped for—to admire the view?’‘I’m sick,’ said Wilson without moving.‘I been sick all day.’"
"“怎么啦？”“我整个人都垮掉了。”","‘What’s the matter?’‘I’m all run down.’"
"“那么是要我自己动手啦？”汤姆问道，“你刚才在电话里听起来还好好的。”","‘Well, shall I help myself?’Tom demanded.‘You sounded well enough on the phone.’"
"威尔森很吃力地从门口的阴凉处走出来，然后喘着气将油箱的盖子拧下来。他的脸在阳光里有些发青。","With an effort Wilson left the shade and support of the doorway and, breathing hard, unscrewed the cap of the tank.In the sunlight his face was green."
"“我并不是故意打扰你吃午饭的。”他说，“可是我急需钱，因此想知道你打算怎么处理你那辆旧车。”","‘I didn’t mean to interrupt your lunch,’ he said.‘But I need money pretty bad and I was wondering what you were going to do with your old car.’"
"“那你觉得这辆怎么样？”汤姆打断他的话说，“我上周买的。”","‘How do you like this one?’ inquired Tom.‘I bought it last week.’"
"“这辆黄车很漂亮。”威尔森一面说一面使劲儿握着加油嘴的手把。","‘It’s a nice yellow one,’ said Wilson, as he strained at the handle."
"“想买这辆？”","‘Like to buy it?’"
"“机会绝好。”威尔森微微地笑着说，“不想要这辆，我可以通过那辆车赚点钱。”","‘Big chance,’ Wilson smiled faintly.‘No, but I could make some money on the other.’"
"“你要钱做什么，还要得这么急？”","‘What do you want money for, all of a sudden?’"
"“我在这儿呆得太久了。我想离开这儿。我的妻子和我都想去西部。”","‘I’ve been here too long.I want to get away.My wife and I want to go west.’"
"“你的妻子想去！”汤姆惊讶地喊道。","‘Your wife does!’ exclaimed Tom, startled."
"“十年以来她一直在说这件事。”他靠在油泵上，双手遮到眼睛上，休息了片刻。“现在她真的要走了，不管她想不想去。我要带她离开这儿。”","‘She’s been talking about it for ten years.’He rested for a moment against the pump, shading his eyes.‘And now she’s going whether she wants to or not.I’m going to get her away.’"
"盖茨比和黛西的那辆小轿车从我们的身边疾驰而过，只见车后尘土飞扬，车上的人跟我们挥了一下手。“我要付你多少钱？”汤姆粗声问道。","The coupé flashed by us with a flurry of dust and the flash of a waving hand.‘What do I owe you?’ demanded Tom harshly."
"“我前两天才发现事情有点蹊跷。”威尔森说，“这就是我想离开这儿的原因。这也是我一直因为那辆汽车而打扰你的原因。”","‘I just got wised up to something funny the last two days,’ remarked Wilson.‘That’s why I want to get away.That’s why I been bothering you about the car.’"
"“我要付你多少钱？”","‘What do I owe you?’"
"“一元二十分。”","‘Dollar twenty.’"
"热浪一波接着一波汹涌而来，弄得我有点头脑发晕，而且有好一会儿心里还挺不舒服的，直到后来才意识到，到那时为止威尔森还并没有怀疑到汤姆的身上。他发现了默特尔背着他在另外一个世界里有着自己的生活，这一让他震惊无比的发现使他一下子病倒了。我盯着看了看威尔森，又看了看汤姆，原来汤姆也是在不到一小时以前才发现了这一点——于是我突然觉得人与人之间在智力或种族上的任何差异，远远不及病人和健康人之间的差异那么大。威尔森病得如此严重，看上去像是犯了错误一般，而且是不可原谅的错误——就像他刚把一个可怜的女孩弄怀孕了似的。","The relentless beating heat was beginning to confuse me and I had a bad moment there before I realized that so far his suspicions hadn’t alighted on Tom.He had discovered that Myrtle had some sort of life apart from him in another world and the shock had made him physically sick.I stared at him and then at Tom, who had made a parallel discovery less than an hour before—and it occurred to me that there was no difference between men, in intelligence or race, so profound as the difference between the sick and the well.Wilson was so sick that he looked guilty, unforgivably guilty—as if he had just got some poor girl with child."
"“我会把那辆车卖给你的。”汤姆说道，“明天下午我就给你送过来。”","‘I’ll let you have that car,’ said Tom.‘I’ll send it over tomorrow afternoon.’"
"这一带总是让人隐隐地感到不安，即便是在这么一个艳阳高照的下午也是如此，这时我转过头去，仿佛有人警告我背后藏着什么东西。在那些灰堆的上方，T.J.埃克尔堡睁着巨大的眼睛守望在那里，但是很快我就发现在不到二十英尺以外的地方，另外一双眼睛也在密切地注视着我们。","That locality was always vaguely disquieting, even in the broad glare of afternoon, and now I turned my head as though I had been warned of something behind.Over the ashheaps the giant eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg kept their vigil but I perceived, after a moment, that other eyes were regarding us with peculiar intensity from less than twenty feet away."
"在修车厂上方的一扇窗户前，窗帘被微微拉开了一点，默特尔·威尔森正在那里悄悄地向下注视着车子。她是那么地全神贯注，根本就没有意识到我看到了她，感情一种接着一种地在她的脸上流露而出，仿佛正在冲洗的底片上慢慢显影的物体一般。她的表情怪怪的，却让我觉得有些似曾相识——这是我经常在一些女人的脸上看到的表情，但是这种表情出现在莫特尔·威尔森的脸上，就显得有些毫无缘由且难以琢磨。直到后来，我才意识到她那瞪得大大的眼睛充满了嫉妒和恐惧，她并不在看汤姆，而是死死盯着乔丹·贝克，原来她将乔丹误认为是汤姆的妻子了。","In one of the windows over the garage the curtains had been moved aside a little and Myrtle Wilson was peering down at the car.So engrossed was she that she had no consciousness of being observed and one emotion after another crept into her face like objects into a slowly developing picture.Her expression was curiously familiar—it was an expression I had often seen on women’s faces but on Myrtle Wilson’s face it seemed purposeless and inexplicable until I realized that her eyes, wide with jealous terror, were fixed not on Tom, but on Jordan Baker, whom she took to be his wife."
"一个简单的头脑一旦陷入慌乱，那真是了不得。我们开车离开的时候，汤姆有些惊慌失措。他的妻子和他的情人，直到一个小时以前还是非常安全、不容侵犯的，但现在却正猝不及防地逃离他的控制。他本能地踩了油门，一方面是想追上黛西，另一方面是想将威尔森抛于脑后。在通往阿斯托利亚的路上，我们以每小时五十英里的速度奔驰而去，直到在高架桥蜘蛛网一般的钢架间，我们看到了那辆逍遥自在的蓝色小轿车。","There is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind, and as we drove away Tom was feeling the hot whips of panic.His wife and his mistress, until an hour ago secure and inviolate, were slipping precipitately from his control.Instinct made him step on the accelerator with the double purpose of overtaking Daisy and leaving Wilson behind, and we sped along toward Astoria at fifty miles an hour, until, among the spidery girders of the elevated, we came in sight of the easygoing blue coupé."
"“第五十号大道附近的大影院很凉爽。”乔丹建议说，“我喜欢夏日纽约的下午，街上没有什么人。非常有感觉——熟透的，好像各种各样奇异的果实都会纷纷落到你的手中。”","‘Those big movies around Fiftieth Street are cool,’ suggested Jordan.‘I love New York on summer afternoons when every one’s away.There’s something very sensuous about it—overripe, as if all sorts of funny fruits were going to fall into your hands.’"
"“感觉”这个词让汤姆更加焦虑不安了，但是他还没来得及找理由来反驳，就看见那辆小轿车在前面停了下来，黛西朝我们做手势，示意要我们开过去并排停下。","The word ‘sensuous’ had the effect of further disquieting Tom but before he could invent a protest the coupé came to a stop and Daisy signalled us to draw up alongside."
"“我们去哪儿呢？”她大声问道。","‘Where are we going?’ she cried."
"“去看电影怎么样？”","‘How about the movies?’"
"“天气真热。”她抱怨道，“你们去吧。我们到处兜兜风，随后再同你们碰面。”她好不容易又想出两句调皮话，“我们在某个街角与你们碰面吧。我到时候就是那个抽着两支香烟的男人。”","‘It’s so hot,’ she complained.‘You go.We’ll ride around and meet you after.’With an effort her wit rose faintly, ‘We’ll meet you on some corner.I’ll be the man smoking two cigarettes.’"
"“我们不能在这儿争论这个。”汤姆很不耐烦地说，同时我们后面有一辆卡车发出了刺耳的鸣笛声。“你们跟我到中央公园南边的广场酒店前面去。”","‘We can’t argue about it here,’ Tom said impatiently as a truck gave out a cursing whistle behind us.‘You follow me to the south side of Central Park, in front of the Plaza.’"
"一路上他几次回过头去找他们的车子，要是他们由于交通拥堵被落到后面了，他就放慢车速，等着看到他们赶上来为止。我想他是生怕他们会转进一个小巷子去，从此永远地从他的生活中消失。","Several times he turned his head and looked back for their car, and if the traffic delayed them he slowed up until they came into sight.I think he was afraid they would dart down a side street and out of his life forever."
"但是他们并没有。而且我们大家都做出了一个让人难以理解的举动，那就是在广场酒店租了一间套房的会客厅。","But they didn’t.And we all took the less explicable step of engaging the parlor of a suite in the Plaza Hotel."
"我已经记不清楚我们呆在那里那么长时间都七嘴八舌地嚷了些什么，最终进了房间。但是我深刻地记得，在屋里争论那段时间，我的内衣像一条湿漉漉的蛇一样在我的双腿间爬来爬去，而后背上隔一会儿便有凉凉的汗珠涔涔地流下来。后来黛西出了个主意，她建议我们去租五间卧室，洗个凉水澡，然后又有了更具体的方案——“找个地方喝杯冰镇薄荷酒。”我们个个都一遍又一遍说这是个“疯狂的想法”——我们同时开口，同一个左右为难的服务生讲话，我们都认为，或至少假装认为，这样做很有趣……","The prolonged and tumultuous argument that ended by herding us into that room eludes me, though I have a sharp physical memory that, in the course of it, my underwear kept climbing like a damp snake around my legs and intermittent beads of sweat raced cool across my back.The notion originated with Daisy’s suggestion that we hire five bathrooms and take cold baths, and then assumed more tangible form as ‘a place to have a mint julep.’Each of us said over and over that it was a ‘crazy idea’—we all talked at once to a baffled clerk and thought, or pretended to think, that we were being very funny_."
"那间房子很大，却很闷，虽然都已经是四点了，但是一打开窗户还是有一股热风从公园的灌木丛中刮来。黛西走到镜子前，背向我们站在那儿梳理着头发。","The room was large and stifling, and, though it was already four o’clock, opening the windows admitted only a gust of hot shrubbery from the Park.Daisy went to the mirror and stood with her back to us, fixing her hair."
"“这个套间真好。”乔丹满怀敬意地低声说道，接着大家都笑了。","‘It’s a swell suite,’ whispered Jordan respectfully and every one laughed."
"“把窗户再开一扇。”黛西头也不回地命令道。","‘Open another window,’ commanded Daisy, without turning around."
"“已经没有窗户可开啦。”","‘There aren’t any more.’"
"“那么，我们最好还是打电话叫他们送个斧头过来……”","‘Well, we’d better telephone for an axe—’"
"“我们要做的是将炎热忘掉。”汤姆不耐烦地说，“你这样唠唠叨叨只会更加难受。”","‘The thing to do is to forget about the heat,’ said Tom impatiently.‘You make it ten times worse by crabbing about it.’"
"他解开酒瓶上的毛巾，将一瓶威士忌酒放在了桌上。","He unrolled the bottle of whiskey from the towel and put it on the table."
"“你又何必老管她呢，老兄？”盖茨比说道，“是你自己要到城里来的。”","‘Why not let her alone, old sport?’ remarked Gatsby.‘You’re the one that wanted to come to town.’"
"接着是一阵沉默。电话薄从钉子上滑落下来，啪的一声掉到了地板上，这时乔丹低声说道：“不好意思。”——但是这次没有一个人笑。","There was a moment of silence.The telephone book slipped from its nail and splashed to the floor, whereupon Jordan whispered ‘Excuse me’—but this time no one laughed."
"“我去捡起来。”我主动说。","‘I’ll pick it up,’ I offered."
"“我捡起来啦。”盖茨比仔细瞧了瞧断开的绳子，轻轻“哼”了一声以示感兴趣，随后便将本子扔到了椅子上。","‘I’ve got it.’Gatsby examined the parted string, muttered ‘Hum!’ in an interested way, and tossed the book on a chair."
"“那是你得意的口头禅，是吧？”汤姆尖酸刻薄地说。","‘That’s a great expression of yours, isn’t it?’ said Tom sharply."
"“什么？”","‘What is?’"
"“动不动‘老兄老兄’的。你在哪儿学来的？”","‘All this ‘old sport’ business.Where’d you pick that up?’"
"“你现在听着，汤姆，”黛西从镜子前转过身来说道，“如果你想搞人身攻击，那我立即就走。打个电话要点冰块来做薄荷酒。”","‘Now see here, Tom,’ said Daisy, turning around from the mirror, ‘if you’re going to make personal remarks I won’t stay here a minute.Call up and order some ice for the mint julep.’"
"汤姆拿起话筒的时候，压抑了很久的热气突然爆发出了声音。我们听到了从楼下舞厅里传上来了门德尔松的《婚礼进行曲》那庄严的和弦旋律。","As Tom took up the receiver the compressed heat exploded into sound and we were listening to the portentous chords of Mendelssohn’s Wedding March from the ball—room below."
"“想想还有人在这样的热天儿结婚！”乔丹沉闷地大声说道。","‘Imagine marrying anybody in this heat!’ cried Jordan dismally."
"“即便如此——我也是在六月中旬结的婚。”黛西回忆道，“六月的路易斯维尔！有人晕倒了。是谁晕倒了啊，汤姆？”","‘Still—I was married in the middle of June,’ Daisy remembered, ‘Louisville in June!Somebody fainted.Who was it fainted, Tom?’"
"“毕洛克西。”他简单答道。","‘Biloxi,’ he answered shortly."
"“一个姓毕洛克西的人。‘木头人’毕洛克西，他是做盒子的——这是事实——而且他的老家是田纳西州一个叫毕洛克西的地方。”","‘A man named Biloxi.‘Blocks’ Biloxi, and he made boxes—that’s a fact—and he was from Biloxi, Tennessee.’"
"“他们把他拖到了我家，”乔丹补充道，“因为我家与教堂中间只隔着两家。后来他在我们家一连住了三个星期，直到爸爸叫他离开时才走。他离开的第二天爸爸就去世了。”过了一会儿，她又补充了一句，似乎她刚才说的有点前言不接后语，“这两件事之间没有任何联系。”","‘They carried him into my house,’ appended Jordan, ‘because we lived just two doors from the church.And he stayed three weeks, until Daddy told him he had to get out.The day after he left Daddy died.’After a moment she added as if she might have sounded irreverent, ‘There wasn’t any connection.’"
"“我以前认识一个孟菲斯人名叫比尔·毕洛克西。”我说。","‘I used to know a Bill Biloxi from Memphis,’ I remarked."
"“那是他的堂兄。他走之前，我对他的整个家史都很了解。他送了我一根铝制的高尔夫球轻击棒，我现在还用着呢。”","‘That was his cousin.I knew his whole family history before he left.He gave me an aluminum putter that I use today.’"
"音乐声渐渐消失了，仪式开始了，这时从窗户飘进来一阵长久的欢呼声，接着又是断断续续的叫喊声“好啊——好——好”，最后突然响起了爵士乐，舞会开始了。","The music had died down as the ceremony began and now a long cheer floated in at the window, followed by intermittent cries of ‘Yea—ea—ea!’ and finally by a burst of jazz as the dancing began."
"“我们变老了。”黛西说，“要是我们还年轻的话，我们就会起来跳舞了。”","‘We’re getting old,’ said Daisy.‘If we were young we’d rise and dance.’"
"“要记得毕洛克西啊。”乔丹提醒她说。“你在哪儿认识他的，汤姆？”","‘Remember Biloxi,’ Jordan warned her.‘Where’d you know him, Tom?’"
"“毕洛克西吗？”他努力地专心想了一会儿，“我不认识他。他是黛西的朋友。”","‘Biloxi?’He concentrated with an effort.‘I didn’t know him.He was a friend of Daisy’s.’"
"“他才不是呢。”她否认道，“我以前就没见到过他。他是坐专车来的。”","‘He was not,’ she denied.‘I’d never seen him before.He came down in the private car.’"
"“可是，他说他认识你的。他说他就在路易斯维尔长大。阿萨·伯德在最后一分钟将他带来的，还问我们是否有地方让他坐。”","‘Well, he said he knew you.He said he was raised in Louisville.Asa Bird brought him around at the last minute and asked if we had room for him.’"
"乔丹笑了笑。","Jordan smiled."
"“他很可能是想免费搭顺风车回家。他告诉我说他是你们在耶鲁大学上学时的班长。”","‘He was probably bumming his way home.He told me he was president of your class at Yale.’"
"汤姆和我非常茫然地瞅了瞅彼此：“毕洛克西？”","Tom and I looked at each other blankly.‘BilOxi?’"
"“首先，我们当时根本就没有什么班长……”","‘First place, we didn’t have any president—’"
"盖茨比的脚连续敲打了几声，显得有些不耐烦，这时汤姆猛地看了看他。","Gatsby’s foot beat a short, restless tattoo and Tom eyed him suddenly."
"“顺便提起来，盖茨比先生，我知道您是牛津毕业的。”","‘By the way, Mr. Gatsby, I understand you’re an Oxford man.’"
"“并不完全是那样。”","‘Not exactly.’"
"“哦，对了，我明白您是上过牛津。”“是的，我上过那儿。”","‘Oh, yes, I understand you went to Oxford.’‘Yes—I went there.’"
"停了一会儿。接着汤姆用充满怀疑和侮辱的语气说道：“你一定是在毕洛克西去纽黑文的时候上的牛津吧。”","A pause.Then Tom’s voice, incredulous and insulting: ‘You must have gone there about the time Biloxi went to New Haven.’"
"又停了一会儿。一个服务员敲了敲门，然后端着压碎的薄荷和冰块走了进来，但是他的一声“谢谢”和轻轻的关门声并没有将屋里的沉默打破。这一重要的细节终于要被澄清了。","Another pause.A waiter knocked and came in with crushed mint and ice but the silence was unbroken by his ‘Thank you’ and the soft closing of the door.This tremendous detail was to be cleared up at last."
"“我跟你说过了我是上过那儿。”盖茨比说。","‘I told you I went there,’ said Gatsby."
"“我听到你说了，只是我想知道你什么时候去的。”","‘I heard you, but I’d like to know when.’"
"“1919年，我在那儿只呆了五个月。这就是我为什么不能真正地称自己是牛津毕业的。”","‘It was in nineteen-nineteen, I only stayed five months.That’s why I can’t really call myself an Oxford man.’"
"汤姆向四周瞅了瞅，想看看大家的脸上是否同他一样写满了怀疑。但是我们都在看着盖茨比。","Tom glanced around to see if we mirrored his unbelief.But we were all looking at Gatsby."
"“停战后他们给一些军官提供了这个机会。”盖茨比继续说道，“我们可以随便挑一所英国或法国的大学读书。”","‘It was an opportunity they gave to some of the officers after the Armistice,’ he continued.‘We could go to any of the universities in England or France.’"
"我真想站起来去拍拍他的肩膀。我再一次对他充满了彻底的信任，就像以前一样。","I wanted to get up and slap him on the back.I had one of those renewals of complete faith in him that I’d experienced before."
"黛西站了起来，微微笑了一下，然后走到桌子前面。","Daisy rose, smiling faintly, and went to the table."
"“打开威士忌酒，汤姆。”她命令道，“我来给你做一杯冰镇薄荷酒。然后你就不会表现得那么蠢了……看这些薄荷叶子！”","‘Open the whiskey, Tom,’ she ordered.‘And I’ll make you a mint julep.Then you won’t seem so stupid to yourself....Look at the mint!’"
"“等一下，”汤姆硬生生地说，“我想再问盖茨比先生一个问题。”","‘Wait a minute,’ snapped Tom, ‘I want to ask Mr. Gatsby one more question.’"
"“说吧。”盖茨比很礼貌地说。","‘Go on,’ Gatsby said politely."
"“你究竟想在我家里制造什么风波？”","‘What kind of a row are you trying to cause in my house anyhow?’"
"最后他们终于把话挑明了，这倒也合盖茨比的心意。","They were out in the open at last and Gatsby was content."
"“他并没有制造风波。”黛西绝望地看看这个，又看看那个，“是你在制造风波。拜托你自制一点。”","‘He isn’t causing a row.’Daisy looked desperately from one to the other.‘You’re causing a row.Please have a little self control.’"
"“自制！”汤姆用怀疑的口吻重复了一遍，“我想最新鲜的事可能就是袖手旁观，任由一个不知道从什么地方冒出来的阿猫阿狗和你老婆在那儿调情。好，如果你那样觉得的话，你可以把我排除在外……这年头人们都开始对家庭生活以及家庭制度冷嘲热讽，下一步他们就开始抛弃一切，在黑人和白人之间通婚了。”","‘Self control!’ repeated Tom incredulously.‘I suppose the latest thing is to sit back and let Mr. Nobody from Nowhere make love to your wife.Well, if that’s the idea you can count me out_.Nowadays people begin by sneering at family life and family institutions and next they’ll throw everything overboard and have intermarriage between black and white.’"
"他激情洋溢地胡言乱语一通，脸涨得通红，俨然觉得自己正在孤身一人守卫着文明的最后一道屏障。","Flushed with his impassioned gibberish he saw himself standing alone on the last barrier of civilization."
"“我们这里大家可都是白人。”乔丹咕哝着说。","‘We’re all white here,’ murmured Jordan."
"“我知道自己不是很受欢迎。我不举行大型宴会。看来你是非得把自己家搞得跟猪圈一样才能交到朋友——在现代社会中。”","‘I know I’m not very popular.I don’t give big parties.I suppose you’ve got to make your house into a pigsty in order to have any friends—in the modern world.’"
"尽管同大家一样，我也感到非常生气，但是每次他一开口说话，我就忍不住想笑出来。一个放荡不羁的花花公子竟然摇身一变就彻彻底底成了道貌岸然的卫道士。","Angry as I was, as we all were, I was tempted to laugh whenever he opened his mouth.The transition from libertine to prig was so complete."
"“我有话和你说，老兄……”盖茨比开口说道。","‘I’ve got something to tell YOU, old sport,—’ began　Gatsby."
"但是黛西已经猜到了他要说什么。","But Daisy guessed at his intention."
"“不要讲了！”她很无助地打断了他的话，“我们都回家吧。我们都回家不好吗？”","‘Please don’t!’ she interrupted helplessly.‘Please let’s all go home.Why don’t we all go home?’"
"“好主意。”我站了起来。“走吧，汤姆。没有人想喝酒了。”","‘That’s a good idea.’I got up.‘Come on, Tom.Nobody wants a drink.’"
"“我想知道盖茨比先生有什么话要跟我说。”","‘I want to know what Mr. Gatsby has to tell me.’"
"“你的妻子并不爱你。”盖茨比说，“她从来就没爱过你。她爱的是我。”","‘Your wife doesn’t love you,’ said Gatsby.‘She’s never loved you.She loves me.’"
"“你肯定疯了吧！”汤姆非常大声地脱口而出。","‘You must be crazy!’ exclaimed Tom automatically."
"盖茨比猛地站了起来，情绪异常激动。","Gatsby sprang to his feet, vivid with excitement."
"“她从来没爱过你，听到没有？”他大声喊着，“她当时跟你结婚只是因为我穷，她等我等得不耐烦了。那可是个大错，但是在她的内心深处，除了我她从来没有爱过任何人！”","‘She never loved you, do you hear?’ he cried.‘She only married you because I was poor and she was tired of waiting for me.It was a terrible mistake, but in her heart she never loved any one except me!’"
"这时我和乔丹都想离开，但是汤姆和盖茨比却较着劲儿让我们留下——仿佛他俩谁都没有什么好隐藏的，而且好像间接地一起分享一下他们的感情是一种荣幸。","At this point Jordan and I tried to go but Tom and Gatsby insisted with competitive firmness that we remain—as though neither of them had anything to conceal and it would be a privilege to partake vicariously of their emotions."
"“坐下，黛西。”汤姆佯装出一种家长的口吻，但却不是很像，“到底是怎么回事？我想仔细听听整件事的来龙去脉。”","‘Sit down Daisy.’Tom’s voice groped unsuccessfully for the paternal note.‘What’s been going on?I want to hear all about it.’"
"“我已经告诉你是怎么回事了。”盖茨比说，“都已经五年了——而你并不知道。”","‘I told you what’s been going on,’ said Gatsby.‘Going on for five years—and you didn’t know.’"
"汤姆猛地转过去看着黛西：","Tom turned to Daisy sharply."
"“你和这家伙已经来往五年了？”","‘You’ve been seeing this fellow for five years?’"
"“并没有来往。”盖茨比说，“不是的，我们见不了面。但是我们俩都一直爱着对方，老兄，而你并不知道。我过去有时会发笑——”但是他的眼中并无笑意，“想到你对此一无所知的时候。”","‘Not seeing,’ said Gatsby.‘No, we couldn’t meet.But both of us loved each other all that time, old sport, and you didn’t know.I used to laugh sometimes—’but there was no laughter in his eyes, ‘to think that you didn’t know.’"
"“哦——就这些啊。”汤姆像牧师一样将双手那粗壮的手指轻轻一拍合到一起，便朝后靠到了椅背上。","‘Oh—that’s all.’Tom tapped his thick fingers together like a clergyman and leaned back in his chair."
"“你真是疯了！”他爆发了，“我没法说五年前的事情，因为那时候我不认识黛西——可是我真他妈不明白你怎么就能接近她，除非你是个到她们家后门送杂货的搬运工。但是其它的那些真他妈是扯淡。结婚的时候，黛西是爱我的，现在她依然是爱我的。”","‘You’re crazy!’ he exploded.‘I can’t speak about what happened five years ago, because I didn’t know Daisy then—and I’ll be damned if I see how you got within a mile of her unless you brought the groceries to the back door.But all the rest of that’s a God Damned lie.Daisy loved me when she married me and she loves me now.’"
"“不对。”盖茨比摇着头说道，","‘No,’ said Gatsby, shaking his head."
"“不管怎样，她确实是爱我的。问题就出在她有时会犯傻，连自己都不知道自己在干什么。”他睿智地点点头，“更重要的是，我也爱黛西。我曾经是出去胡闹过，干了些傻事，但我总能回得去，而且在我的心里，我一直是爱着她的。”","‘She does, though.The trouble is that sometimes she gets foolish ideas in her head and doesn’t know what she’s doing.’He nodded sagely.‘And what’s more, I love Daisy too.Once in a while I go off on a spree and make a fool of myself, but I always come back, and in my heart I love her all the time.’"
"“你真恶心。”黛西说。她转过身来朝着我，声音降了个八度，整个屋里都充满了她激动的嘲笑声，“你知道我们为什么离开芝加哥吗？我真奇怪怎么没人给你讲讲他干的那件荒唐事儿。”","‘You’re revolting,’ said Daisy.She turned to me, and her voice, dropping an octave lower, filled the room with thrilling scorn: ‘Do you know why we left Chicago?I’m surprised that they didn’t treat you to the story of that little spree.’"
"盖茨比走过去站在了她身边：","Gatsby walked over and stood beside her."
"“黛西，现在一切都已经结束了。”他认真地说，“现在那些已经不再重要了。只要告诉他真相——说你从来没爱过他——这一切就永远一笔勾销了。”","‘Daisy, that’s all over now,’ he said earnestly.‘It doesn’t matter any more.Just tell him the truth—that you never loved him—and it’s all wiped out forever.’"
"她茫然地看着他。“是啊——我怎么会爱他呢——怎么可能呢？”","She looked at him blindly.‘Why,—how could I love him—possibly?’"
"“你从来就没爱过他。”","‘You never loved him.’"
"她犹豫了。她那求助的目光落到了我和乔丹的身上，似乎终于意识到了自己到底在干什么——又好像她一直都根本没想着要干什么。但是现在事情已经做了。就为时已晚了。","She hesitated.Her eyes fell on Jordan and me with a sort of appeal, as though she realized at last what she was do-ing—and as though she had never, all along, intended doing anything at all.But it was done now.It was too late."
"“我从来就没爱过他。”她说，明显有点勉强。","‘I never loved him,’ she said, with perceptible reluctance."
"“在凯皮奥兰尼也没有吗？”汤姆突然问道。","‘Not at Kapiolani?’ demanded Tom suddenly."
"“没有。”","‘No.’"
"楼下舞厅里那低沉而令人窒息的和弦声顺着滚滚热浪飘了上来。","From the ballroom beneath, muffled and suffocating chords were drifting up on hot waves of air."
"“那天为了不让你的鞋子沾水，我把你从‘潘趣博’号上抱下来，也没有爱我吗？”·他那沙哑的声音中充满了柔情，“黛西？”","‘Not that day I carried you down from the Punch Bowl to keep your shoes dry?’There was a husky tenderness in his tone.‘Daisy?’"
"“求你不要再说了。”她的声音冷冷的，但是其中已经不再有怨恨了。她看着盖茨比。“噢，杰伊。”她说——但是当她尝试着点烟的时候，手却在发抖。突然她将香烟和燃着的火柴往地上一扔。","‘Please don’t.’Her voice was cold, but the rancour was gone from it.She looked at Gatsby.‘There, Jay,’ she said—but her hand as she tried to light a cigarette was trembling.Suddenly she threw the cigarette and the burning match on the carpet."
"“哦，你要求也太过分了吧！”她冲着盖茨比喊道，“我现在爱你——这还不够吗？过去的事我无能为力。”她很无助地呜咽起来，“我是曾经爱过他——但是我也爱过你。”","‘Oh, you want too much!’ she cried to Gatsby.‘I love you now—isn’t that enough?I can’t help what’s past.’She began to sob helplessly.‘I did love him once—but I loved you too.’"
"盖茨比的眼睛睁开一下又合上了。","Gatsby’s eyes opened and closed."
"“你也爱过我？”他重复了一遍。","‘You loved me TOO?’ he repeated."
"“连这句也是谎言，”汤姆蛮横地说，“她就不知道你还活着。看吧——我和黛西之间的许多事情你根本就不知道，而我们也永远都不会忘记的。”","‘Even that’s a lie,’ said Tom savagely.‘She didn’t know you were alive.Why,—there’re things between Daisy and me that you’ll never know, things that neither of us can ever forget.’"
"这些话深深地刺痛了盖茨比的心。","The words seemed to bite physically into Gatsby."
"“我想和黛西单独谈谈。”他坚持说道，“她现在太激动了……”","‘I want to speak to Daisy alone,’ he insisted.‘She’s all excited now—’"
"“即便是单独谈我也不能说自己从来就没爱过汤姆。”她用一种让人深感同情的声音承认道，“那不是真心话。”","‘Even alone I can’t say I never loved Tom,’ she admitted in a pitiful voice.‘It wouldn’t be true.’"
"“当然不是真心话了。”汤姆附和道。","‘Of course it wouldn’t,’ agreed Tom."
"她转身看着自己的丈夫。","She turned to her husband."
"“你好像还挺在乎这些的。”她说。","‘As if it mattered to you,’ she said."
"“当然在乎了。从今以后我会更好地照顾你。”","‘Of course it matters.I’m going to take better care of you from now on.’"
"“你并不明白。”盖茨比带着一丝恐慌说道，“你以后再也不会有机会照顾她了。”","‘You don’t understand,’ said Gatsby, with a touch of panic.‘You’re not going to take care of her any more.’"
"“我没机会了？”汤姆姆瞪大眼睛放声大笑起来。他现在可以控制住自己了，“凭什么那样说啊？”","‘I’m not?’Tom opened his eyes wide and laughed.He could afford to control himself now.‘Why’s that?’"
"“黛西要离开你了。”","‘Daisy’s leaving you.’"
"“胡说八道。”","‘Nonsense.’"
"“不过，我确实要离开。”明显她是费了很大的劲儿才说出来的。","‘I am, though,’ she said with a visible effort."
"“她是不会离开我的！”汤姆突然将矛头指向了盖茨比，“当然绝不会为了个大骗子而离开我的，一个连给她戴的婚戒都要去偷的大骗子。”","‘She’s not leaving me!’Tom’s words suddenly leaned down over Gatsby.‘Certainly not for a common swindler who’d have to steal the ring he put on her finger.’"
"“我受不了啦！”黛西大声喊道，“啊，求求你们了，我们走吧。”","‘I won’t stand this!’ cried Daisy.‘Oh, please let’s get out.’"
"“你究竟是什么玩意儿？”汤姆破口而出，“你就是跟迈耶·沃尔夫山姆混在一起的一个人，这些碰巧我知道。我对你的事儿做了些调查——而且明天我会进一步展开调查的。”","‘Who are you, anyhow?’ broke out Tom.‘You’re one of that bunch that hangs around with Meyer Wolfshiem—that much I happen to know.I’ve made a little investigation into your affairs—and I’ll carry it further tomorrow.’"
"“你尽请自便，老兄。”盖茨比镇定地说。","‘You can suit yourself about that, old sport.’ said Gatsby steadily."
"“我早发现你的那些‘药店’在搞什么名堂了。”他转过来看着我们，很快地说起来，“他和这个沃尔夫山姆在这儿和芝加哥的小街小巷买了很多药店，而且柜台上私自卖酒精给人家。这只是他那些小把戏中的一个罢了。我第一次见到他就觉得他是个私酒贩子，看来我猜得还差不多。”","‘I found out what your ‘drug stores’ were.’He turned to us and spoke rapidly.‘He and this Wolfshiem bought up a lot of side-street drug stores here and in Chicago and sold grain alcohol over the counter.That’s one of his little stunts.I picked him for a bootlegger the first time I saw him and I wasn’t far wrong.’"
"“那又怎么样呢？”盖茨比礼貌地说，“你朋友沃尔特·蔡斯和我们合伙，我没看出他觉得有多丢人啊。”","‘What about it?’ said Gatsby politely.‘I guess your friend Walter Chase wasn’t too proud to come in on it.’"
"“他还被你们给坑害了，不是吗？你们害得他在新泽西蹲了一个月的监狱。天哪！你就该听听沃尔特是怎么评价你的。”","‘And you left him in the lurch, didn’t you?You let him go to jail for a month over in New Jersey.God!You ought to hear Walter on the subject of YOU.’"
"“他来找我们的时候可是一穷二白。他自己也很高兴赚点钱，老兄。”","‘He came to us dead broke.He was very glad to pick up some money, old sport.’"
"“别叫我‘老兄’！”汤姆大声喊道。盖茨比什么都没说。“沃尔特本来可以告你们违法赌博的，但是沃尔夫山姆恐吓他，他就没敢说。”","‘Don’t you call me ‘old sport’!’ cried Tom.Gatsby said nothing.‘Walter could have you up on the betting laws too, but Wolfshiem scared him into shutting his mouth.’"
"那种陌生的却又似曾相识的表情再次出现在盖茨比的脸上。","That unfamiliar yet recognizable look was back again in Gatsby’s face."
"“药店的那点事儿不过是小意思，”汤姆继续慢慢地说道，“而你们现在搞的名堂，沃尔特都不敢告诉我。”","‘That drug store business was just small change,’ continued Tom slowly, ‘but you’ve got something on now that Walter’s afraid to tell me about.’"
"我瞅了黛西一眼，只见她用极其恐惧的眼神盯着盖茨比看了看，又看看她的丈夫，然后看看乔丹——她的下巴尖上又顶起了虽然看不到却很吸引人的东西，在那里保持着平衡。随后我回过身去看了看盖茨比——他那表情真是让我大吃一惊。他看上去好像刚“杀了一个人”似的——我说这话可跟他花园里的那些流言诽谤没半点关系。那会儿，他脸上的那副表情只能用那种荒唐的字眼来描述。","I glanced at Daisy who was staring terrified between Gatsby and her husband and at Jordan who had begun to balance an invisible but absorbing object on the tip of her chin.Then I turned back to Gatsby—and was startled at his expression.He looked—and this is said in all contempt for the babbled slander of his garden—as if he had ‘killed a man.’For a moment the set of his face could be described in just that fantastic way."
"这种表情很快就消失了，他情绪非常激动地开始向黛西解释，矢口否认一切，竭力捍卫自己的声誉，驳斥那些并无人指控的罪行。但是他越是说，黛西就越显得疏远，于是他便放弃了，只有那个破灭的梦想正随着下午的流逝在继续挣扎，拼命想触摸那些已经再也触摸不到的东西，朝着屋子那边的那个迷失的声音痛苦却并不绝望地挣扎着。","It passed, and he began to talk excitedly to Daisy, denying everything, defending his name against accusations that had not been made.But with every word she was drawing further and further into herself, so he gave that up and only the dead dream fought on as the afternoon slipped away, trying to touch what was no longer tangible, struggling unhappily, undespairingly, toward that lost voice across the room."
"那个声音开始再次央求大家离开：","The voice begged again to go."
"“求你了，汤姆！我再也受不了了。”","‘PLEASE, Tom!I can’t stand this any more.’"
"她那双充满了恐惧的眼睛告诉大家，不管她以前曾经有过怎样的意愿，有过怎样的勇气，现在已经不复存在了。","Her frightened eyes told that whatever intentions, whatever courage she had had, were definitely gone."
"“你们两人动身回家吧，黛西。”汤姆说，“就坐盖茨比先生的车。”","‘You two start on home, Daisy,’ said Tom.‘In Mr. Gatsby’s car.’"
"她看着汤姆，惊恐万分，而他却坚持要她和盖茨比一起走，故意以这种宽宏大量来表示侮蔑，","She looked at Tom, alarmed now, but he insisted with magnanimous scorn."
"“走吧。他是不会再烦你了。我想他也意识到自己的那点自以为是的小情调已经结束了。”","‘Go on.He won’t annoy you.I think he realizes that his presumptuous little flirtation is over.’"
"他们走了，没说一句话，匆匆而去，变得无足轻重，孤零零地像一对鬼影一般，我们甚至还没来得及表示同情。","They were gone, without a word, snapped out, made accidental, isolated, like ghosts even from our pity."
"过了一会儿，汤姆站了起来，用毛巾裹住那瓶还未开启的威士忌酒：","After a moment Tom got up and began wrapping the unopened bottle of whiskey in the towel."
"“想不想喝点这个？乔丹？……尼克？”","‘Want any of this stuff?Jordan?...Nick?’"
"我没有回答。“尼克？”他又问了一遍。","I didn’t answer.‘Nick?’He asked again."
"“什么？”","‘What?’"
"“想喝点儿不？”","‘Want any?’"
"“不要了……我刚想起来今天是我的生日。”","‘No _ I just remembered that today’s my birthday.’"
"我三十岁了。新的十年展现在我的面前，那是一条坎坷不平、凶多吉少的道路。","I was thirty.Before me stretched the portentous menacing road of a new decade."
"等我们同汤姆一起坐上小轿车，起身回长岛的时候，已经是七点了。汤姆一路上不停地说这说那，得意洋洋地哈哈笑着，但是他的声音对于我和乔丹来说，就如同人行道上听不清的嘈杂声和头顶上高架桥上的吵闹声一样遥远。人的同情心是有限度的，因此我们也宁愿让他们那些可悲的争执随着城市的灯光渐渐消逝。三十岁——这个年龄预示着新的十年又将是孤独的十年，可交往的单身汉渐渐减少，热情渐渐退去，头发渐渐稀薄。但是我的身边有乔丹，她和黛西不一样，她非常明智，不会将那些已经尘封的旧梦年复一年地藏于心上。当我们驶过漆黑的铁桥时，她那疲惫的脸慵懒地靠在我的肩上。她的手紧紧握住我的手，这使三十岁生日带给我的那种巨大的恐惧感渐渐消失了。","It was seven o’clock when we got into the coupé with him and started for Long Island.Tom talked incessantly, exulting and laughing, but his voice was as remote from Jordan and me as the foreign clamor on the sidewalk or the tumult of the elevated overhead.Human sympathy has its limits and we were content to let all their tragic arguments fade with the city lights behind.Thirty—the promise of a decade of loneliness, a thinning list of single men to know, a thinning brief-case of enthusiasm, thinning hair.But there was Jordan beside me who, unlike Daisy, was too wise ever to carry well-forgotten dreams from age to age.As we passed over the dark bridge her wan face fell lazily against my coat’s shoulder and the formidable stroke of thirty died away with the reassuring pressure of her hand."
"于是我们在慢慢凉爽下来的暮色中朝死亡驶去。","So we drove on toward death through the cooling twilight."
"一个年轻的希腊人米凯利斯，在那些灰堆的旁边开了一个咖啡馆，他是案件调查中的主要见证人。那个炎热的下午，他一直睡到了五点钟，起来后便溜达着去了修理厂。在那里他看到乔治·威尔森病倒在办公室里——病得很重，面色就如同他自己的头发一样煞白，浑身上下都在发抖。米凯利斯建议他上床休息，但是他就是不肯，说是那样的话就会错过很多生意。当这位邻居正在努力说服他的时候，楼上突然传来了一阵激烈的吵闹声。","The young Greek, Michaelis, who ran the coffee joint beside the ashheaps was the principal witness at the inquest.He had slept through the heat until after five, when he strolled over to the garage and found George Wilson sick in his office—really sick, pale as his own pale hair and shaking all over.Michaelis advised him to go to bed but Wilson refused, saying that he’d miss a lot of business if he did.While his neighbor was trying to persuade him a violent racket broke out overhead."
"“我把我老婆锁在楼上了。”威尔森平静地解释道，“她得在上面一直呆到后天，然后我们就搬走了。”","‘I’ve got my wife locked in up there,’ explained Wilson calmly.‘She’s going to stay there till the day after tomorrow and then we’re going to move away.’"
"米凯利斯非常惊讶，他们做了四年的邻居，威尔森一点都不像是能说出这种话的人。平常，他都是一副疲惫不堪的样子：不干活的时候就坐在门前的椅子上，呆呆地看着路上来来往往的行人和车流。不管是谁跟他说话，他总是和和气气却又无精打采地笑一笑。他对老婆言听计从，没有自己的主张。","Michaelis was astonished; they had been neighbors for four years and Wilson had never seemed faintly capable of such a statement.Generally he was one of these worn-out men: when he wasn’t working he sat on a chair in the doorway and stared at the people and the cars that passed along the road.When any one spoke to him he invariably laughed in an agreeable, colorless way.He was his wife’s man and not his own."
"因此很自然地，米凯利斯就要问问到底是发生什么事情了，但是威尔森一句话都不说——相反，他却开始用一种好奇、充满怀疑的目光打量着这位客人，还盘问他在某些日子的某些时间到底在干什么。就当米凯利斯感到越来越不自在的时候，几个工人从门口经过，朝他的餐厅的方向走去，米凯利斯就趁机脱了身，打算过会儿再过来。但他并没有再过来。他想自己大概是忘了，也没有什么其他原因。七点过了没多久，他再次出来的时候，便又想起了刚才的谈话，因为他听到威尔森夫人在楼下修理厂正大声责骂。","So naturally Michaelis tried to find out what had happened, but Wilson wouldn’t say a word—instead he began to throw curious, suspicious glances at his visitor and ask him what he’d been doing at certain times on certain days.Just as the latter was getting uneasy some workmen came past the door bound for his restaurant and Michaelis took the opportunity to get away, intending to come back later.But he didn’t.He supposed he forgot to, that’s all.When he came outside again a little after seven he was reminded of the conversation because he heard Mrs. Wilson’s voice, loud and scolding, downstairs in the garage."
"“你打我啊！”他听到她大声喊着，“把我按在地上打我啊，你这个肮脏的胆小鬼！”","‘Beat me!’ he heard her cry.‘Throw me down and beat me, you dirty little coward!’"
"过了一会儿，她冲到外边的暮色里，挥着手大声嚷嚷着——他还没来得及出门，惨祸就发生了。那辆“死亡之车”——这是一家报纸上的称呼——根本就没停，车子从昏暗的暮色中开来，肇事后悲惨地摇晃片刻，然后在前面拐个弯儿就没影儿了。米凯利斯连车的颜色都没有看清——他告诉第一个问他的警察说是浅绿色的。另外一辆车，一辆开往纽约的车，在一百码以外停了下来，司机急忙返回到事发地点，默特尔·威尔森惨死在马路中央，她跪在那里，暗红的浓血和灰尘混合在一起。","A moment later she rushed out into the dusk, waving her hands and shouting; before he could move from his door the business was over.The ‘death car’ as the newspapers called it, didn’t stop; it came out of the gathering darkness, wavered tragically for a moment and then disappeared around the next bend.Michaelis wasn’t even sure of its color—he told the first policeman that it was light green.The other car, the one going toward New York, came to rest a hundred yards beyond, and its driver hurried back to where Myrtle Wilson, her life violently extinguished, knelt in the road and mingled her thick, dark blood with the dust."
"米凯利斯和这个司机是最先赶到她身边的，但当他们撕开她那被汗水浸湿的衬衫时，她左边的乳房松垮垮地耷拉了下来，因此已经没必要去听那下面的心脏了。她的嘴张得很大，嘴角撕破了一点，仿佛在释放那储存了这么久的巨大能量时，喉咙有点哽住了。","Michaelis and this man reached her first but when they had torn open her shirtwaist still damp with perspiration, they saw that her left breast was swinging loose like a flap and there was no need to listen for the heart beneath.The mouth was wide open and ripped at the corners as though she had choked a little in giving up the tremendous vitality she had stored so long."
"我们远远就看到三四辆汽车还有一大群人。","We saw the three or four automobiles and the crowd when we were still some distance away."
"“车祸！”汤姆说，“这下好了。威尔森总算有点生意了。”","‘Wreck!’ said Tom.‘That’s good.Wilson’ll have a little business at last.’"
"他减慢了速度，但是并无意要停车。直到我们走得更近的时候，看到修理厂门口一群人安安静静地站在那里，神色严肃，汤姆便不由自主地踩下了刹车。","He slowed down, but still without any intention of stopping until, as we came nearer, the hushed intent faces of the people at the garage door made him automatically put on the brakes."
"“我们过去看一下，”汤姆带着些疑惑说道，“就看一下。”","‘We’ll take a look,’ he said doubtfully, ‘just a look.’"
"这时我听到修车厂里不断地传出一声声空洞的哀号，当我们下了车朝门口走去的时候，才听到那声音在上气不接下气、一遍又一遍地哀号：“哦，我的天哪！”","I became aware now of a hollow, wailing sound which issued incessantly from the garage, a sound which as we got out of the coupé and walked toward the door resolved itself into the words ‘Oh, my God!’ uttered over and over in a gasping moan."
"“这儿有大麻烦了。”汤姆激动地说。","‘There’s some bad trouble here,’ said Tom excitedly."
"他踮着脚尖从一层又一层的围观者的头上向修车厂里面望去，只见里面仅亮着一盏黄色的灯，摇摇晃晃地挂在头顶上方的铁丝罩上。接着他吼了一声，用他那有力的双臂猛烈地向前推去，从人群中挤了过去。","He reached up on tiptoes and peered over a circle of heads into the garage which was lit only by a yellow light in a swinging wire basket overhead.Then he made a harsh sound in his throat and with a violent thrusting movement of his powerful arms pushed his way through."
"被扒开的人群又围在了一起，同时传出一阵阵低低的劝告声，一下子我又什么都看不见了。随后新到的人又将人群挤乱了，于是我和乔丹便被猛地挤到了里面。","The circle closed up again with a running murmur of expostulation; it was a minute before I could see anything at all.Then new arrivals disarranged the line and Jordan and I were pushed suddenly inside."
"默特尔·威尔森的尸体被裹在一条毯子里，毯子外边又裹了一条毯子，似乎在这个炎热的夜晚还怕她受凉。尸体放在墙边的一张工作台上，汤姆背对着我们，低着头一动不动地看着。他的旁边站着一个骑摩托车的警察，满头大汗地在一个小本子上写着名字，时不时地还涂涂改改的。起初我并没发现回荡在空空的修车厂里的哀号哭喊声到底源于何人——随后我看到威尔森正站在办公室门口突出的门槛上，双手抱着门框在那里摇来晃去的。有个人在那里同他小声讲话，时不时想将手放在他的肩膀上，但是他既听不到也看不到。他的目光缓缓地从摇晃着的灯上下移到墙边那张放着尸体的桌上，忽而又猛地移回到灯上去，同时不停地发出高得可怕的哭喊声：","Myrtle Wilson’s body wrapped in a blanket and then in another blanket as though she suffered from a chill in the hot night lay on a work table by the wall and Tom, with his back to us, was bending over it, motionless.Next to him stood a motorcycle policeman taking down names with much sweat and correction in a little book.At first I couldn’t find the source of the high, groaning words that echoed clamorously through the bare garage—then I saw Wilson standing on the raised threshold of his office, swaying back and forth and holding to the doorposts with both hands.Some man was talking to him in a low voice and attempting from time to time to lay a hand on his shoulder, but Wilson neither heard nor saw.His eyes would drop slowly from the swinging light to the laden table by the wall and then jerk back to the light again and he gave out incessantly his high horrible call."
"“哦，我的天……哪！哦，我的天……哪！哦，我的天……哪！哦，我的天……哪！”过了一会儿，汤姆猛地抬起了头，用呆滞的目光扫视了一下修车厂之后，便语无伦次地向警察咕哝了几句。","‘O, my Ga—od!O, my Ga—od!Oh, Ga—od!Oh, my Ga—od!’Presently Tom lifted his head with a jerk and after staring around the garage with glazed eyes addressed a mumbled incoherent remark to the policeman."
"“马弗——”警察说着，“奥——”","‘M—a—v—’ the policeman was saying, ‘—o—’"
"“不对，罗——”那人更正道，“马——弗——罗”","‘No,—r—’ corrected the man, ‘M-a-v-r-o—’"
"“听我说！”汤姆恶狠狠地低声说道。","‘Listen to me!’ muttered Tom fiercely."
"“罗——”警察说，“奥——”","‘r—’ said the policeman, ‘o—’"
"“格——”","‘g—’"
"“格——”汤姆的大手掌重重地落在了他的肩上，他抬起了头，“你想干嘛，伙计？”","‘g—’ He looked up as Tom’s broad hand fell sharply on his shoulder.‘What you want, fella?’"
"“发生什么事了——这就是我想知道的！”","‘What happened—that’s what I want to know!’"
"“一辆汽车撞了她，当场死亡。”","‘Auto hit her.Ins’antly killed.’"
"“当场死亡。”汤姆瞪着双眼重复了一遍。","‘Instantly killed,’ repeated Tom, staring."
"“她跑到了路中间。那个狗娘养的连车都没停。”","‘She ran out ina road.Son-of-a-bitch didn’t even stopus car.’"
"“当时有两辆车，”米凯利斯说，“一辆过来，一辆过去，明白不？”","‘There was two cars,’ said Michaelis, ‘one comin’, one goin’, see?’"
"“去什么地方？”警察急切地问道。","‘Going where?’ asked the policeman keenly."
"“两辆车开往相反的方向。还有，她——”他的手朝着毯子举起来，但是举到一半就停了下来，又放回到身旁去，“她冲到外边的马路上，从纽约方向开来的那辆车迎面撞上了她，时速大约有三四十英里。”","‘One goin’ each way.Well, she—’ His hand rose toward the blankets but stopped half way and fell to his side, ‘—she ran out there an’ the one comin’ from N’York knock right into her goin’ thirty or forty miles an hour.’"
"“这个地方叫什么名字？”警察问道。","‘What’s the name of this place here?’ demanded the officer."
"“还没有什么名字。”","‘Hasn’t got any name.’"
"一个面色苍白、穿着体面的黑人走上前来。","A pale, well-dressed Negro stepped near."
"“那是一辆黄色的车子，”他说，“非常大的黄色汽车。新的。”","‘It was a yellow car,’ he said, ‘big yellow car.New.’"
"“看到车祸的经过了吗？”警察问道。","‘See the accident?’ asked the policeman."
"“没有，但是那辆车开到那边时，正好从我身边开过，时速不止四十英里。有五六十英里。”","‘No, but the car passed me down the road, going faster’n forty.Going fifty, sixty.’"
"“过来，告诉我们你的名字。现在都让开。我要记他的名字。”","‘Come here and let’s have your name.Look out now.I want to get his name.’"
"这些谈话肯定是有几句传到了在办公室门口左摇右晃的威尔森的耳朵，因为他那上气不接下气的哭喊声突然冒出了新的内容：","Some words of this conversation must have reached Wilson swaying in the office door, for suddenly a new theme found voice among his gasping cries."
"“你没必要告诉我那是一辆什么样的车，我知道那是一辆什么样的车！”","‘You don’t have to tell me what kind of car it was!I know what kind of car it was!’"
"我注视着汤姆，只见他肩膀后面的那块肌肉在衣服下绷得紧紧的。他赶快向威尔森走去，然后站在他面前，紧紧地抓住他的上臂。","Watching Tom I saw the wad of muscle back of his shoulder tighten under his coat.He walked quickly over to Wilson and standing in front of him seized him firmly by the upper arms."
"“你一定要振作起来。”他用粗哑的声音安慰道。","‘You’ve got to pull yourself together,’ he said with soothing gruffness."
"威尔森的目光落到了汤姆的身上，他踮着脚尖想站直，却不料差点就跪倒在地上了，幸好汤姆把他给扶直了。","Wilson’s eyes fell upon Tom; he started up on his tiptoes and then would have collapsed to his knees had not Tom held him upright."
"“听我说，”汤姆轻轻地摇了他一下说道，“我从纽约回来刚路过这儿。我正把我们一直谈的那辆小轿车给你送过来。今天下午我开的那辆黄色的车并不是我的，听到没？后来我整个下午都没见到它。”","‘Listen,’ said Tom, shaking him a little.‘I just got here a minute ago, from New York.I was bringing you that coupé we’ve been talking about.That yellow car I was driving this afternoon wasn’t mine, do you hear?I haven’t seen it all afternoon.’"
"只有那个黑人和我离得够近，能听到他在说什么。但是那个警察听出他的语气有问题，于是便恶狠狠地向这边看过来。","Only the Negro and I were near enough to hear what he said but the policeman caught something in the tone and looked over with truculent eyes."
"“你在那儿说什么呢？”他质问道。","‘What’s all that?’ he demanded."
"“我是他的朋友。”汤姆将头转过来，但双手还是紧紧地抓着威尔森，“他说他认识那辆肇事的车子……是一辆黄色的车子。”警察隐约感觉事情有点不对劲，便用怀疑的目光看着汤姆：","‘I’m a friend of his.’Tom turned his head but kept his hands firm on Wilson’s body.‘He says he knows the car that did it... It was a yellow car.’Some dim impulse moved the policeman to look suspiciously at Tom."
"“那么你的车是什么颜色的？”","‘And what color’s your car?’"
"“是一辆蓝色的车子，小轿车。”","‘It’s a blue car, a coupé.’"
"“我们刚从纽约来的。”我说。","‘We’ve come straight from New York,’ I said."
"有一位一直开车跟在我们后面不远的人证实了这一点，于是警察便将头转了过去：","Some one who had been driving a little behind us confirmed this and the policeman turned away."
"“现在，让我再核对一下你的名字……”","‘Now, if you’ll let me have that name again correct—’"
"汤姆将威尔森像玩偶一样提起来，拖到办公室里，放在一把椅子上，然后自己就回来了。","Picking up Wilson like a doll Tom carried him into the office, set him down in a chair and came back."
"“有没有人过来陪他坐会儿！”汤姆用命令的口吻说道。他张望着，这时离他最近的两个男的相互瞅了彼此一眼，便极不情愿地走进了屋里。随后汤姆关上了门，迈下那一级台阶，目光故意避开不看那张桌子。他经过我身边的时候低声说道：“我们走吧。”","‘If somebody’ll come here and sit with him!’ he snapped authoritatively.He watched while the two men standing closest glanced at each other and went unwillingly into the room.Then Tom shut the door on them and came down the single step, his eyes avoiding the table.As he passed close to me he whispered ‘Let’s get out.’"
"汤姆用那双霸道的手在人群中开路，我们在越聚越多的人群中跟着往前挤，还碰到一位匆匆赶来的医生，手里领着药箱，还是半个小时以前抱着一线希望让人去请的。","Self consciously, with his authoritative arms breaking the way, we pushed through the still gathering crowd, passing a hurried doctor, case in hand, who had been sent for in wild hope half an hour ago."
"汤姆开得很慢，直到过了那个拐弯之后他的脚才使劲踩了下去，于是小轿车在夜色中飞驰而去。过了一会儿，我听到一阵低沉沙哑的抽泣声，接着看到他泪流满面。","Tom drove slowly until we were beyond the bend—then his foot came down hard and the coupé raced along through the night.In a little while I heard a low husky sob and saw that the tears were overflowing down his face."
"“这个该死的懦夫！”他喃喃说道，“他连车都没停。”","‘The God Damn coward!’ he whimpered.‘He didn’t even stop his car.’"
"穿过黑黢黢的、沙沙作响的树木，布坎南的房子突然出现在我们的面前。汤姆将车停在走廊边上，抬头看了看二楼，在蔓藤中有两扇窗户透着明亮的灯光。","The Buchanans’ house floated suddenly toward us through the dark rustling trees.Tom stopped beside the porch and looked up at the second floor where two win—dows bloomed with light among the vines."
"“黛西在家。”他说。我们下车的时候，他瞅了我一眼，又轻轻地皱了皱眉头：","‘Daisy’s home,’ he said.As we got out of the car he glanced at me and frowned slightly."
"“我应该在西卵就让你们下车的，尼克。我们今晚没什么事可做了。”","‘I ought to have dropped you in West Egg, Nick.There’s nothing we can do tonight.’"
"他的身上发生了某种变化，说话的样子又严肃又果断。我们穿过月光照耀下的石子路向门廊走的时候，他用几句话就很干脆利落地处理了眼前的情况：","A change had come over him and he spoke gravely, and with decision.As we walked across the moonlight gravel to the porch he disposed of the situation in a few brisk phrases."
"“我打电话找辆出租车送你们回家，你们等车的时候，你和乔丹最好到厨房去，让他们给弄点晚饭——要是你们想吃的话。”他推开了门，“进来吧。”","‘I’ll telephone for a taxi to take you home, and while you’re waiting you and Jordan better go in the kitchen and have them get you some supper—if you want any.’He opened the door.‘Come in.’"
"“不用了，谢谢。但是要请你替我叫一辆出租车。我就在外边等吧。”","‘No thanks.But I’d be glad if you’d order me the taxi.I’ll wait outside.’"
"乔丹伸手挽住我的胳膊：","Jordan put her hand on my arm."
"“你不进来了吗，尼克？”","‘Won’t you come in, Nick?’"
"“不了，谢谢。”","‘No thanks.’"
"我有点不舒服，想一个人呆一会儿。但是乔丹还是不肯走。“现在才九点半。”她说。","I was feeling a little sick and I wanted to be alone.But Jordan lingered for a moment more.‘It’s only half past nine,’ she said."
"我是说什么也不会进去的，这一天我是受够了他们这些人了，突然间也觉得受够了乔丹。她一定是从我的表情看出点什么了，因为她猛地转过身去，跑上门廊的台阶，进屋去了。我用双手抱着头在那儿坐了几分钟，直到听到里面有人拿起电话，又听出是男管家的声音，他在叫出租车。然后我慢慢地沿着车道离开房子，想在门口等出租。我还没走出二十码远，就听到有人在叫我的名字，接着看到盖茨比从两个灌木丛中间走出来，来到小路上。我那时一定是被惊呆了，因为当时脑子里除了他那套在月光下闪闪发亮的粉色西服之外，一片空白。","I’d be damned if I’d go in; I’d had enough of all of them for one day and suddenly that included Jordan too.She must have seen something of this in my expression for she turned abruptly away and ran up the porch steps into the house.I sat down for a few minutes with my head in my hands, until I heard the phone taken up inside and the butler’s voice calling a taxi.Then I walked slowly down the drive away from the house intending to wait by the gate.I hadn’t gone twenty yards when I heard my name and Gatsby stepped from between two bushes into the path.I must have felt pretty weird by that time because I could think of nothing except the luminosity of his pink suit under the moon."
"“你在做什么呢？”我问道。","‘What are you doing?’I inquired."
"“就是在这儿站着，老兄。”","‘Just standing here, old sport.’"
"不知道为什么，他看上去像是要做什么卑鄙之事。说不定他要马上抢劫这一家呢。这时即便是从他身后漆黑的灌木丛中突然冒出来几张凶神恶煞的脸，“沃尔夫山姆那帮人”的面孔，我也不会感到惊讶的。","Somehow, that seemed a despicable occupation.For all I knew he was going to rob the house in a moment; I wouldn’t have been surprised to see sinister faces, the faces of ‘Wolf-shiem’s people,’ behind him in the dark shrubbery."
"“你在路上看到出什么事了吗？”过了一会儿他问道。","‘Did you see any trouble on the road?’ he asked after a minute."
"“看到了。”","‘Yes.’"
"他犹豫了一会儿：“她死了吗？”","He hesitated.‘Was she killed?’"
"“死了。”","‘Yes.’"
"“我当时就想到了，我对黛西也这样说了。所有的打击一起都来，反而好些。她遇事还是挺坚强的。”","‘I thought so; I told Daisy I thought so.It’s better that the shock should all come at once.She stood it pretty well.’"
"听他的话，好像黛西的反应是唯一重要的事。","He spoke as if Daisy’s reaction was the only thing that mattered."
"“我从一条小路开回西卵，”他继续说道，“然后将车子放到我的车库里。我想并没人看到我们，但当然也不敢确定，”","‘I got to West Egg by a side road,’ he went on, ‘and left the car in my garage.I don’t think anybody saw us but of course I can’t be sure.’"
"到这时我已经非常讨厌他了，所以就觉得没必要告诉他说他错了。","I disliked him so much by this time that I didn’t find it necessary to tell him he was wrong."
"“那女的是谁？”他问道。","‘Who was the woman?’ he inquired."
"“她的名字叫威尔森。他丈夫是那家修理厂的老板。这事儿到底是怎么发生的啊？”“嗯，我是想把方向盘扳过来……”他突然停住了，我也猛然意识到了事情的真相。“是黛西在开车吗？”","‘Her name was Wilson.Her husband owns the garage.How the devil did it happen?’‘Well, I tried to swing the wheel—’ He broke off, andsuddenly I guessed at the truth.‘Was Daisy driving?’"
"“是的，”他过了一会儿说道，“但我当然要说我在开。事情是这样的，我们离开纽约的时候她情绪非常紧张，她觉得开车可以帮助她平静下来——而正好对面有一辆车朝我们开来的时候，那个女人突然冲我们跑出来。所有一切在一刹那就发生了，但是我似乎觉得她想和我们说话，把我们当成了她认识的人。嗯，黛西先是避开那个女的朝另一辆车冲去，但后来她就有点惊慌失措，又转了回去。我的手碰到方向盘的时候，就感觉到剧烈的震动——一定是当场就把她撞死了。”","‘Yes,’ he said after a moment, ‘but of course I’ll say I was.You see, when we left New York she was very nervous and she thought it would steady her to drive—and this woman rushed out at us just as we were passing a car coming the other way.It all happened in a minute but it seemed to me that she wanted to speak to us, thought we were somebody she knew.Well, first Daisy turned away from the woman toward the other car, and then she lost her nerve and turned back.The second my hand reached the wheel I felt the shock—it must have killed her instantly.’"
"“把她都撞开花了……”","‘It ripped her open—’"
"“别说了，老兄。”他有点畏缩，“即便如此，黛西还是踩着油门不放。我想让她停下来，但是她停不了了，于是我就拉了紧急刹车。接着她就倒在我的腿上，我接过来继续向前开去。”","‘Don’t tell me, old sport.’He winced.‘Anyhow—Daisy stepped on it.I tried to make her stop, but she couldn’t so I pulled on the emergency brake.Then she fell over into my lap and I drove on.’"
"“她明天就没事了。”过了一会儿他说道，“我就在这儿等着，看看他是否因为今天下午那些不开心的事儿而找她麻烦。她把自己锁在了屋里，如果他敢动一点粗的话，她就会把灯关了然后再打开。”","‘She’ll be all right tomorrow,’ he said presently.‘I’m just going to wait here and see if he tries to bother her about that unpleasantness this afternoon.She’s locked herself into her room and if he tries any brutality she’s going to turn the light out and on again.’"
"“他是不会动她的。”我说，“他现在想的就不是她。”","‘He won’t touch her,’ I said.‘He’s not thinking about her.’"
"“我可不信任他，老兄。”","‘I don’t trust him, old sport.’"
"“你要在这儿等多久？”","‘How long are you going to wait?’"
"“如果有必要的话就等一晚上。至少也要等到他们都睡了。”","‘All night if necessary.Anyhow till they all go to bed.’"
"我忽然有了个新想法。假如汤姆知道了开车的是黛西，他也许会认为事出有因——或许还会乱想半天。我看了看那座房子，楼下亮着两三扇窗户，二楼黛西的房间泛着粉红色的柔光。","A new point of view occurred to me.Suppose Tom found out that Daisy had been driving.He might think he saw a connection in it—he might think anything.I looked at the house: there were two or three bright windows downstairs and the pink glow from Daisy’s room on the second floor."
"“你在这儿等着，”我说，“我去看看有没有什么吵闹的迹象。”","‘You wait here,’ I said.‘I’ll see if there’s any sign of a commotion.’"
"我沿着草坪边缘走了回去，轻手轻脚地穿过石子路，然后踮着脚尖上了走廊的台阶。客厅的窗帘敞开着，里面空无一人。我又穿过了阳台——三个月前的那个六月的晚上我们就在这里吃的饭——来到了一小片长方形的灯光前，我猜这儿应该是食品间的窗户。窗帘是拉着的，但是我在窗台处找到了一个缝隙。","I walked back along the border of the lawn, traversed the gravel softly and tiptoed up the veranda steps.The drawing-room curtains were open, and I saw that the room was empty.Crossing the porch where we had dined that June night three months before I came to a small rectangle of light which I guessed was the pantry window.The blind was drawn but I found a rift at the sill."
"黛西和汤姆正面对面坐在厨房的桌子的两边，两人中间的桌面上放着一盘冷炸鸡和两瓶啤酒。他正隔着桌子非常专心地对她说着什么，他是那样热切，还将手放在了她的手上，握住了她的手。她不时地抬头看看他，并赞同地点点头。","Daisy and Tom were sitting opposite each other at the kitchen table with a plate of cold fried chicken between them and two bottles of ale.He was talking intently across the table at her and in his earnestness his hand had fallen upon and covered her own.Once in a while she looked up at him and nodded in agreement."
"他们并不开心，而且谁都没有动一下炸鸡或啤酒——可是他们也并没有难过。这画面清清楚楚地流露着一种自然而亲密的气氛，谁看了都会说他们俩正一起谋划着什么。","They weren’t happy, and neither of them had touched the chicken or the ale—and yet they weren’t unhappy either.There was an unmistakable air of natural intimacy about the picture and anybody would have said that they were conspiring together."
"我蹑手蹑脚地走下阳台的时候，听见我的出租车正摸黑缓缓开向房子这边。盖茨比还在我们刚刚谈话的车道那里等着。","As I tiptoed from the porch I heard my taxi feeling its way along the dark road toward the house.Gatsby was waiting where I had left him in the drive."
"“上面一切都平静吧？”他焦急地问道。","‘Is it all quiet up there?’ he asked anxiously."
"“是的，一切都很平静。”我迟疑了一下，“你最好还是回家睡觉吧。”他摇了摇头。","‘Yes, it’s all quiet.’I hesitated.‘You’d better come home and get some sleep.’He shook his head."
"“我想在这儿一直等到黛西睡觉。晚安，老兄。”","‘I want to wait here till Daisy goes to bed.Good night, old sport.’"
"他将双手插到衣兜里，急切地转过身，密切注视着那座房子，仿佛我的出现有碍于他神圣的守护。于是我便走开了，留下他一个人站在月光里——空守着。","He put his hands in his coat pockets and turned back eagerly to his scrutiny of the house, as though my presence marred the sacredness of the vigil.So I walked away and left him standing there in the moonlight—watching over nothing."
"第八章","Chapter 8"
"我彻夜难眠，海湾上的雾迪警报声在不停地呜呜作响，而我却像一个病人一样，在离奇古怪的现实和胆战心惊的噩梦之间辗转反侧。临近拂晓的时候，我听到盖茨比的车道上有出租车开来的声音，于是我赶紧从床上跳下来，穿上衣服——我感觉自己有话要跟他说，有事要提醒他，等到早上恐怕就来不及了。","I couldn’t sleep all night; a fog-horn was groaning incessantly on the Sound, and I tossed half-sick between grotesque reality and savage frightening dreams.Toward dawn I heard a taxi go up Gatsby’s drive and immediately I jumped out of bed and began to dress—I felt that I had something to tell him, something to warn him about and morning would be too late."
"我穿过他家草坪，看到他的大门依然开着，而他则在大厅里靠在一张桌上，由于情绪低落或缺少睡眠而显得疲惫不堪。","Crossing his lawn I saw that his front door was still open and he was leaning against a table in the hall, heavy with dejection or sleep."
"“什么事都没发生。”他有气无力地说，“我一直等到凌晨四点钟的时候，她走到窗户前站了一会儿，然后把灯关了。”","‘Nothing happened,’ he said wanly.‘I waited, and about four o’clock she came to the window and stood there for a minute and then turned out the light.’"
"那天晚上我们在他家为了找香烟挨个搜遍了一间又一间的大房子，那时候我第一次觉得他的房子是如此之大。我们把像帐篷一样的窗帘推到一边，摸着漆黑一片、没有边际的墙壁，寻找着电灯开关——有一次我还被绊了一下，轰的一声就摔在了那架幽灵似的钢琴的键盘上。屋里到处都是灰尘，不知哪儿来那么多灰尘，房间也都是霉味儿，仿佛好久都没有通风了。我在一张不大熟悉的桌子上找到了一个雪茄盒，里面有两根已放了多时的干瘪了的香烟。我们将客厅的法式落地窗打开，坐在那里对着漆黑的夜抽着烟。“你应该离开这儿。”我说，“他们肯定会追查你的车子的。”","His house had never seemed so enormous to me as it did that night when we hunted through the great rooms for cigarettes.We pushed aside curtains that were like pavilions and felt over innumerable feet of dark wall for electric light switches—once I tumbled with a sort of splash upon the keys of a ghostly piano.There was an inexplicable amount of dust everywhere and the rooms were musty as though they hadn’t been aired for many days.I found the humidor on an unfamiliar table with two stale dry cigarettes inside.Throwing open the French windows of the drawing-room we sat smoking out into the darkness.‘You ought to go away,’ I said.‘It’s pretty certain they’ll trace your car.’"
"“现在离开，老兄？”","‘Go away NOW, old sport?’"
"“到大西洋城区呆上一周，或者到北边的蒙特利尔去。”","‘Go to Atlantic City for a week, or up to Montreal.’"
"他不想考虑这些。在他得知黛西下一步的打算之前，他是不可能离开的。他拼命抓着最后一线希望不肯放手，而我也不忍心叫他撒手。","He wouldn’t consider it.He couldn’t possibly leave Daisy until he knew what she was going to do.He was clutching at some last hope and I couldn’t bear to shake him free."
"就在那天晚上，他给我讲了他年轻的时候和丹·科迪之间发生的一些离奇的故事——他之所以告诉我是因为“杰伊·盖茨比”已经像玻璃一样被汤姆的恶意中伤砸得粉碎，而那出漫长的秘密幻想剧也已经谢幕。我想他现在已经毫无保留地承认一切，但是他却想说黛西的事。","It was this night that he told me the strange story of his youth with Dan Cody—told it to me because ‘Jay Gatsby’ had broken up like glass against Tom’s hard malice and the long secret extravaganza was played out.I think that he would have acknowledged anything, now, without reserve, but he wanted to talk about Daisy."
"她是他认识的第一个“名门闺秀”。他也曾隐藏身份同此类人接触过，每次总是觉得他们之间隔着一道看不清的铁丝网。他对她无比倾心。他去了她家，起初是同泰勒军营的其他军官去的，后来就单独前往了。她的家令他惊叹不已——他从来都没到过这么漂亮的住宅。但是这个房子之所以令他屏气息声、紧张无比，是因为黛西就住在那儿——这个房子在她的眼中是那么平常，就像他眼中军营里的帐篷那样。这个房子充满了无限神秘，似乎暗示着楼上有着更漂亮、更舒服的卧室，暗示着走廊里到处都是带给人无限欢乐和活力的活动，暗示着风流韵事——并不是那种发霉过时的、封存于薰衣草之中的浪漫，而是鲜活逼真的浪漫，当年闪亮汽车的芳香和鲜花依旧绽放的舞会。更令他激动不已的是，有很多男人曾经倾心于黛西——这也更加提高了她在他眼中的价值。他感觉到他们存在于房间的角角落落，空气中弥漫着他们的身影，回荡着他们热烈的情感。","She was the first ‘nice’ girl he had ever known.In various unrevealed capacities he had come in contact with such people but always with indiscernible barbed wire between.He found her excitingly desirable.He went to her house, at first with other officers from Camp Taylor, then alone.It amazed him—he had never been in such a beautiful house before.But what gave it an air of breathless intensity was that Daisy lived there—it was as casual a thing to her as his tent out at camp was to him.There was a ripe mystery about it, a hint of bedrooms upstairs more beautiful and cool than other bedrooms, of gay and radiant activities taking place through its corridors and of romances that were not musty and laid away already in lavender but fresh and breathing and redolent of this year’s shining motor cars and of dances whose flowers were scarcely withered.It excited him too that many men had already loved Daisy—it increased her value in his eyes.He felt their presence all about the house, pervading the air with the shades and echoes of still vibrant emotions."
"但是他知道自己能出入黛西家也纯属巧合。不管他作为杰伊·盖茨比会有多么美好的前程，现在他也只是一个出身贫寒、身无分文的年轻人，而且他的这套不起眼的军装随时会从他的肩头滑落。因此他充分利用了自己的时间。他利用他所能得到的东西，如饥似渴，肆无忌惮——终于在十月一个静寂的晚上，他占有了黛西，他要占有她，是因为他知道自己根本没有权利碰她的手。","But he knew that he was in Daisy’s house by a colossal accident.However glorious might be his future as Jay Gatsby, he was at present a penniless young man without a past, and at any moment the invisible cloak of his uniform might slip from his shoulders.So he made the most of his time.He took what he could get, ravenously and unscrupulously—eventually he took Daisy one still October night, took her because he had no real right to touch her hand."
"他也许是应该鄙视自己，因为他无疑是通过伪装和欺骗才占有她的。我并不是说他是利用那虚幻的百万家产得到她的，而是说他有意给黛西制造一种安全感，让她相信他是同她属于同一社会阶层的——并相信他完全可以照顾好她。事实上，他根本就没有这种能力——他的背后没有富有的家庭支撑，而且只要无情的政府一声令下，他随时都可能被调遣到世界的任何地方去。","He might have despised himself, for he had certainly taken her under false pretenses.I don’t mean that he had traded on his phantom millions, but he had deliberately given Daisy a sense of security; he let her believe that he was a person from much the same stratum as herself—that he was fully able to take care of her.As a matter of fact he had no such facilities—he had no comfortable family standing behind him and he was liable at the whim of an impersonal government to be blown anywhere about the world."
"但是他并没有鄙视自己，事情的结果并不是他想象的那样。他可能本来只是打算及时行乐，然后一走了之——但是此刻他却发现自己已经开始投身追求一个理想。他知道黛西与众不同，但是他却没有意识到“名门闺秀”原来可以如此地与众不同。她消失在那座豪宅里，消失在她富裕多彩的生活中，留下盖茨比一人——一无所有。他感觉自己已经和她结婚了，仅此而已。","But he didn’t despise himself and it didn’t turn out as he had imagined.He had intended, probably, to take what he could and go—but now he found that he had committed himself to the following of a grail.He knew that Daisy was extraordinary but he didn’t realize just how extraordinary a ‘nice’ girl could be.She vanished into her rich house, into her rich, full life, leaving Gatsby—nothing.He felt married to her, that was all."
"两天之后他们再次见面之时，那个有点紧张不安、似乎被欺骗了的人是盖茨比。她那奢华的阳台上星光灿烂、明亮无比。她转身过来让他吻自己那奇妙、可爱的双唇之时，柳条长靠椅在那里入时地吱吱作响。她感冒了，这让她的声音比平常更加沙哑而迷人。盖茨比非常深切地体会到财富中所蕴藏的青春与神秘；体会到一套套衣服中展现出来的清新靓丽；体会到像白银一样皎皎发光的黛西是怎样安然高居于穷苦人激烈的生存奋斗之上。","When they met again two days later it was Gatsby who was breathless, who was somehow betrayed.Her porch was bright with the bought luxury of star-shine; the wicker of the settee squeaked fashionably as she turned toward him and he kissed her curious and lovely mouth.She had caught a cold and it made her voice huskier and more charming than ever and Gatsby was overwhelmingly aware of the youth and mystery that wealth imprisons and preserves, of the freshness of many clothes and of Daisy, gleaming like silver, safe and proud above the hot struggles of the poor."
"“我无法向你描述，当我发现自己已经爱上她的时候是多么惊诧，老兄。我有段时间甚至希望她把我给甩了，但是她没有，因为她同样也爱我。她觉得我懂得很多东西，因为我知道的东西和她知道的不同……嗯，我就是那样把雄心壮志抛到一边，每一分钟都爱得越来越深，忽然之间我什么都不在乎了。如果告诉她我的打算，我就能过得更幸福，那么我又何必去做什么大事呢？”","‘I can’t describe to you how surprised I was to find out I loved her, old sport.I even hoped for a while that she’d throw me over, but she didn’t, because she was in love with me too.She thought I knew a lot because I knew different things from her.Well, there I was, way off my ambitions, getting deeper in love every minute, and all of a sudden I didn’t care.What was the use of doing great things if I could have a better time telling her what I was going to do?’"
"出国前的最后一个下午，他将黛西搂在怀里静静地坐了很久很久。那是一个寒冷的秋日，屋里生了火，黛西的两颊映得通红。她时不时地动一下，而他也轻轻挪动一下胳膊，有一次他还吻了她那乌黑发亮的头发。那天下午他们安安静静地坐了一会儿，似乎想为明天那长时间的离别留下段深刻的记忆。她静静地用唇拂过他上衣的肩头，而他则温柔地抚摸着她的指尖，仿佛她睡着了一般。他们谈恋爱的一个月以来，彼此从来都没有如此亲近过，也从来都没有如此深刻地交流过。","On the last afternoon before he went abroad he sat with Daisy in his arms for a long, silent time.It was a cold fall day with fire in the room and her cheeks flushed.Now and then she moved and he changed his arm a little and once he kissed her dark shining hair.The afternoon had made them tranquil for a while as if to give them a deep memory for the long parting the next day promised.They had never been closer in their month of love nor communicated more profoundly one with another than when she brushed silent lips against his coat’s shoulder or when he touched the end of her fingers, gently, as though she were asleep."
"他在战争期间表现非常出色。还没上前线，他就当上了上尉。阿尔贡战役之后，他又晋升为少校，还当上了师里机枪连的连长。停战后他迫不及待地想回国，但是由于情况复杂或是一些误会，他却被送去了牛津。此刻他非常担心——因为黛西的信里流露着一种紧张而绝望的情绪。她不理解为什么他不能回来。她感受到了来自外界的压力，而且非常想见他，想感觉到他就在自己的身边，想让他给自己信心，让自己相信现在所做的一切是完全正确的。","He did extraordinarily well in the war.He was a captain before he went to the front and following the Argonne battles he got his majority and the command of the divisional machine guns.After the Armistice he tried frantically to get home but some complication or misunderstanding sent him to Oxford instead.He was worried now—there was a quality of nervous despair in Daisy’s letters.She didn’t see why he couldn’t come.She was feeling the pressure of the world outside and she wanted to see him and feel his presence beside her and be reassured that she was doing the right thing after all."
"毕竟黛西还年轻，在她那虚饰的世界里充满了兰花的芬芳、欢快愉悦的谄媚奉承、还有交响乐队——这些乐队会定下当年的基调，同时用新的曲调总结哀伤和启示。萨克斯管会通宵演奏《比尔街布鲁斯》那忧伤的哀号，同时有几百双金色和银色的舞鞋扬起闪亮的灰尘。每天晚茶时分，总有一些房间会在这低沉而甜美的狂热旋律中不停地颤动，同时一张张娇艳的脸庞会飘来飘去，仿佛是被哀怨的号子吹落满地的玫瑰花瓣。","For Daisy was young and her artificial world was redolent of orchids and pleasant, cheerful snobbery and orchestras which set the rhythm of the year, summing up the sadness and suggestiveness of life in new tunes.All night the saxophones wailed the hopeless comment of the ‘Beale Street Blues’ while a hundred pairs of golden and silver slippers shuffled the shining dust.At the grey tea hour there were always rooms that throbbed incessantly with this low sweet fever, while fresh faces drifted here and there like rose petals blown by the sad horns around the floor."
"在这个朦朦胧胧的世界里，随着社交季节的到来，黛西又开始活跃起来。她突然又会每天与不同的男人约上五六次会，到拂晓时分才昏昏沉沉入睡，晚礼服被丢在床边的地板上，上面的珠子和薄纱同凋谢了的兰花缠绕在一起。这段时间她的内心深处一直在呼唤着一个决定。她想现在就将自己的终身大事定下来，刻不容缓——而这个决定需要在某种外力的迫使下才能做出——爱情也好，金钱也好，必须是实实在在的东西——而这些东西要近在眼前，唾手可得。","Through this twilight universe Daisy began to move again with the season; suddenly she was again keeping half a dozen dates a day with half a dozen men and drowsing asleep at dawn with the beads and chiffon of an evening dress tangled among dying orchids on the floor beside her bed.And all the time something within her was crying for a decision.She wanted her life shaped now, immediately—and the decision must be made by some force—of love, of money, of unquestionable practicality—that was close at hand."
"春天刚过了一半的时候，随着汤姆·布坎南的到来，这种外力变得具体起来。这个人的身材和身份都很有分量，因而黛西觉得受宠若惊。毫无疑问，她经过了一番思想斗争，然后便如释重负。盖茨比收到来信的时候，他还在牛津。","That force took shape in the middle of spring with the arrival of Tom Buchanan.There was a wholesome bulkiness about his person and his position and Daisy was flattered.Doubtless there was a certain struggle and a certain relief.The letter reached Gatsby while he was still at Oxford."
"这时长岛上已是破晓时分，我们走过去把楼下其余的窗户都打开了，屋里充满了渐渐变为银白色而后又变为金黄色的光线。一棵树的影子突兀地落在了露珠上，幽灵般的鸟儿开始在青色的树叶间唱起歌来。空气中缓缓流淌着愉悦之气，几乎没有风，这一天将会是一个凉爽宜人的好天气。","It was dawn now on Long Island and we went about opening the rest of the windows downstairs, filling the house with grey turning, gold turning light.The shadow of a tree fell abruptly across the dew and ghostly birds began to sing among the blue leaves.There was a slow pleasant movement in the air, scarcely a wind, promising a cool lovely day."
"“我相信她从来就没爱过他。”盖茨比从窗户前转过身来，用充满挑战之意的眼神看着我，“你一定要记得，老兄，她今天下午非常激动。他今天下午给她讲这些事情的方式把她吓坏了——听起来好像我是个一文不值的骗子，结果她就几乎不知道自己在说什么了。”","‘I don’t think she ever loved him.’Gatsby turned around from a window and looked at me challengingly.‘You must remember, old sport, she was very excited this afternoon.He told her those things in a way that frightened her—that made it look as if I was some kind of cheap sharper.And the result was she hardly knew what she was saying.’"
"他无比沮丧地坐了下来。","He sat down gloomily."
"“当然她可能是爱过他，就是在他们刚结婚的那么一会儿——即便在那时，她也是更爱我一些，你明白吗？”","‘Of course she might have loved him, just for a minute, when they were first married—and loved me more even then, do you see?’"
"突然他又冒出一句很奇怪的话：","Suddenly he came out with a curious remark:"
"“不管怎么样，”他说，“这只是我个人的事。”","‘In any case,’ he said, ‘it was just personal.’"
"你还能怎么理解呢？只能推测他对于这件事的看法中的种种感情已经强烈到了无法计量的地步。","What could you make of that, except to suspect some intensity in his conception of the affair that couldn’t be measured?"
"他从法国回来的时候，汤姆和黛西还在蜜月旅行。他痛不欲生，但还是忍不住用军饷余下的最后一点钱去了一趟路易斯维尔。他在那里呆了一周，走遍了当初十一月的一个个夜晚他俩并肩漫步过的所有街道，又重访了当年他俩开着她那辆白色的汽车去过的那些偏僻之地。正如黛西的房子在他的眼中向来都比起其他房子更神秘、更欢快，现在黛西虽然离开了，但是这座城市在他的眼中依旧充满了一种忧伤的美。","He came back from France when Tom and Daisy were still on their wedding trip, and made a miserable but irre—sistible journey to Louisville on the last of his army pay.He stayed there a week, walking the streets where their footsteps had clicked together through the November night and revisiting the out-of-the-way places to which they had driven in her white car.Just as Daisy’s house had always seemed to him more mysterious and gay than other houses so his idea of the city itself, even though she was gone from it, was pervaded with a melancholy beauty."
"他离开的时候觉得如果他寻找得再努力一点的话，或许会找到她——而自己现在正弃她而去。硬座车厢非常闷热——他自己现在却是身无分文。他走到车厢之间的通廊，在一把折叠椅上坐下，望着飞驰而过的车站，望着陌生的建筑物背影一闪而过。接着，火车驶过春天的田野。田野上一辆黄色的电车在那里和火车并肩奔驰了一会儿，车上的人或许在哪条街上碰巧看到了她那张楚楚动人的脸。","He left feeling that if he had searched harder he might have found her—that he was leaving her behind.The day-coach—he was penniless now—was hot.He went out to the open vestibule and sat down on a folding-chair, and the station slid away and the backs of unfamiliar buildings moved by.Then out into the spring fields, where a yellow trolley raced them for a minute with people in it who might once have seen the pale magic of her face along the casual street."
"铁道拐了个弯，火车现在正背对着太阳行驶。太阳渐渐沉了下去，用四射的余晖为这个即将远去的、她曾经生活过的城市送上祝福。他绝望地伸出手去，似乎想要抓住哪怕是一缕空气，好留住这个地方的一点碎片，因为这个地方曾经因为她而变得如此美好。但是现在一切都走得太快了，他泪眼模糊，因为他知道自己已经失去了，永远地失去了那最鲜活、最美好的部分。","The track curved and now it was going away from the sun which, as it sank lower, seemed to spread itself in benediction over the vanishing city where she had drawn her breath.He stretched out his hand desperately as if to snatch only a wisp of air, to save a fragment of the spot that she had made lovely for him.But it was all going by too fast now for his blurred eyes and he knew that he had lost that part of it, the freshest and the best, forever."
"我们吃过早饭后来到门廊上已是九点钟。一夜间天气骤然变化，空气中有了一丝秋天的气息。一个园丁——盖茨比先前的那批佣人中唯一一个留下来的——来到台阶脚下。“我准备今天将游泳池的水放掉，盖茨比先生。树叶很快就要落了，到时候水管肯定会出问题的。”","It was nine o’clock when we finished breakfast and went out on the porch.The night had made a sharp difference in the weather and there was an autumn flavor in the air.The gardener, the last one of Gatsby’s former servants, came to the foot of the steps.‘I’m going to drain the pool today, Mr. Gatsby.Leaves’ll start falling pretty soon and then there’s always trouble with the pipes.’"
"“今天不要放。”盖茨比回答说。他带着一丝歉意转身看着我：“你知道，老兄，整个夏天我从没下去游过泳呢！”","‘Don’t do it today,’ Gatsby answered.He turned to me apologetically.You know, old sport, I’ve never used that pool all summer!'"
"我看了看表，站了起来。","I looked at my watch and stood up."
"“我乘坐的那班车还有十二分钟就要开了。”","‘Twelve minutes to my train.’"
"我不想进城去了。我没心思做正经的工作，但更重要的是——我不想丢下盖茨比。我错过了那班车，接着又错过了一班，后来才极不情愿地离开。","I didn’t want to go to the city.I wasn’t worth a decent stroke of work but it was more than that—I didn’t want to leave Gatsby.I missed that train, and then another, before I could get myself away."
"“我会给你打电话的。”我最后说道。","‘I’ll call you up,’ I said finally."
"“一定要，老兄。”","‘Do, old sport.’"
"“我会在中午前后给你打电话。”","‘I’ll call you about noon.’"
"我们慢慢地走下台阶。","We walked slowly down the steps."
"“我想黛西也会打电话的。”他非常不安地看着我，似乎希望能在我这里得到确认。","‘I suppose Daisy’ll call too.’He looked at me anxiously as if he hoped I’d corroborate this."
"“我想她会的。”","‘I suppose so.’"
"“那么——再见了。”","‘Well—goodbye.’"
"我们握了握手，随后我就离开了。还没走到篱笆，我又想起了一件事，于是便转过身来：","We shook hands and I started away.Just before I reached the hedge I remembered something and turned around."
"“他们真是一帮混蛋。”我隔着草坪大声喊道，“他们那帮混蛋加在一起都比不上你。”","‘They’re a rotten crowd,’ I shouted across the lawn.‘You’re worth the whole damn bunch put together.’"
"我后来一直为自己说了那句话而感到高兴。这是我对他说的唯一一句赞美之辞，因为自始至终我都在否定他。他先是礼貌地点点头，接着脸上便绽放出灿烂的、会心的微笑，仿佛在这件事情上我们一直以来都是密切的同伙关系。他那套华丽的粉色西服在白色台阶的映衬下显得光鲜夺目，于是我想起了三个月前第一次踏入他这栋古色古香的别墅的那个晚上。当时草坪和车道上都满是人，他们都纷纷猜测着他的犯罪行径——而他却站在台阶上，藏起他那纯洁的梦，挥手与他们告别。","I’ve always been glad I said that.It was the only compliment I ever gave him, because I disapproved of him from beginning to end.First he nodded politely, and then his face broke into that radiant and understanding smile, as if we’d been in ecstatic cahoots on that fact all the time.His gogeous pink rag of a suit made a bright spot of color against the white steps and I thought of the night when I first came to his ancestral home three months before.The lawn and drive had been crowded with the faces of those who guessed at his corruption—and he had stood on those steps, concealing his incorruptible dream, as he waved them goodbye."
"我非常感谢他的热情款待。我们会一直对此心怀谢意——我和其他的人们。","I thanked him for his hospitality.We were always thanking him for that—I and the others."
"“再见！”我大声喊道，“早餐很好，盖茨比。”","‘Goodbye,’ I called.‘I enjoyed breakfast, Gatsby.’"
"到了城里后，我勉强整理了一会儿那长长的股市行情表，随后就在转椅上睡着了。还没到中午，电话铃声就把我吵醒了，我被惊了一下，额头上直冒汗珠子。打电话的是乔丹，她经常在这个点儿给我打电话，因为她自己的行踪很不确定，不是在酒店、俱乐部，就是在私人住宅，我很难用任何其他办法找到她。她的声音通常在电话里听起来非常清新悦耳，仿佛球棒削起的一块草皮从绿茵茵的高尔夫球场飘落到办公室的窗口来，但今天早上她的声音却显得生硬而枯涩。","Up in the city I tried for a while to list the quotations on an interminable amount of stock, then I fell asleep in my swivel-chair.Just before noon the phone woke me and I startled up with sweat breaking out on my forehead.It was Jordan Baker; she often called me up at this hour because the uncertainty of her own movements between hotels and clubs and private houses made her hard to find in any other way.Usually her voice came over the wire as something fresh and cool as if a divot from a green golf links had come sailing in at the office window but this morning it seemed harsh and dry."
"“我已经离开了黛西家。”她说，“我现在在亨普斯特德，下午打算去南安普顿。”","‘I’ve left Daisy’s house,’ she said.‘I’m at Hempstead and I’m going down to Southampton this afternoon.’"
"或许她离开黛西家是明智之举，但是她的做法让我很不开心，而她的下一句话更是让我生气。","Probably it had been tactful to leave Daisy’s house, but the act annoyed me and her next remark made me rigid."
"“你昨天晚上对我的态度可不怎么好。”","‘You weren’t so nice to me last night.’"
"“在那种情况下那又有什么关系呢？”","‘How could it have mattered then?’"
"她沉默了片刻。接着说道：","Silence for a moment.Then—"
"“无论如何……我想见见你。”","‘However—I want to see you.’"
"“我也想见见你。”“那么我不去南安普顿，下午进城来，好不？”","‘I want to see you too.’‘Suppose I don’t go to Southampton, and come into town this afternoon?’"
"“不行……我今天下午不行。”“真是好。”","‘No—I don’t think this afternoon.’‘Very well.’"
"“今天下午真的不可能。各种各样的……”","‘It’s impossible this afternoon.Various—’"
"我们就这样聊了一会儿，后来突然就都不说话了。我不知道我们俩到底是谁先“啪”的一声将电话挂上的，但是我知道自己并不在乎了。我那天真的不可能同她坐在桌子旁喝茶聊天，即便是她从此永远都不理我了。","We talked like that for a while and then abruptly we weren’t talking any longer.I don’t know which of us hung up with a sharp click but I know I didn’t care.I couldn’t have talked to her across a tea-table that day if I never talked to her again in this world."
"几分钟后我给盖茨比家里打了电话，但是线路忙。我打了四次，最后接线员不耐烦了，告诉我说这条线路在专等来自底特律的长途电话。我拿出列车时刻表，在三点五十分的那班车上画了个小圆圈。然后我靠在椅子上，想思考一下。现在才是中午。","I called Gatsby’s house a few minutes later, but the line was busy.I tried four times; finally an exasperated central told me the wire was being kept open for long distance from Detroit.Taking out my time-table I drew a small circle around the three-fifty train.Then I leaned back in my chair and tried to think.It was just noon."
"那天早上当我乘火车经过那些灰堆的时候，我特意走到了车厢的另一边。我想那儿一整天都会有一群好奇的人们在围观，那些小男孩会在尘土中找寻着黑色的血斑，还有那些多嘴之人会一遍一遍地讲着所发生的一切，直到越讲越觉得不真实，自己再没办法讲下去了，于是默特尔·威尔森悲惨的结局就被人们忘记了。现在我想倒回去讲一下前天夜里我们离开修车厂之后，那里发生的一些事情。","When I passed the ashheaps on the train that morning I had crossed deliberately to the other side of the car.I suppose there’d be a curious crowd around there all day with little boys searching for dark spots in the dust and some garrulous man telling over and over what had happened until it became less and less real even to him and he could tell it no longer and Myrtle Wilson’s tragic achievement was forgotten.Now I want to go back a little and tell what happened at the garage after we left there the night before."
"他们费了好大的劲儿才找到她的妹妹凯瑟琳。她那天晚上也肯定是破了自己的酒戒，因为当她到来的时候，她醉得稀里糊涂的，怎么也不理解救护车怎么就已经开到弗拉兴去了。等他们让她相信了这一点时，她立即就昏过去了，仿佛这是整个事件中最让她无法忍受的。有个人，出于好意或者是好奇，用自己的车带着她跟在她姐姐的灵车后面一路开了过去。","They had difficulty in locating the sister, Catherine.She must have broken her rule against drinking that night for when she arrived she was stupid with liquor and unable to understand that the ambulance had already gone to Flush—ing.When they convinced her of this she immediately fainted as if that was the intolerable part of the affair.Someone kind or curious took her in his car and drove her in the wake of her sister’s body."
"直到午夜过去很久以后，还是不断地有人拥堵在修车厂门口，而乔治·威尔森在里面的沙发上不停地前后摇晃着。开始办公室的门是开着的，凡是进了修车厂的人就忍不住向里面瞅瞅。后来有人说这太不象话了，就将门关上了。米凯利斯还有几个男的陪着他——开始是四五个人，后来就剩了两三个人再到后来，米凯利斯不得不叫最后的那个陌生人在那儿多呆十五分钟，自己利用这点时间回家煮了一壶咖啡。之后，他就一个人陪着威尔森一直呆到天亮。","Until long after midnight a changing crowd lapped up against the front of the garage while George Wilson rocked himself back and forth on the couch inside.For a while the door of the office was open and everyone who came into the garage glanced irresistibly through it.Finally someone said it was a shame and closed the door.Michaelis and several other men were with him—first four or five men, later two or three men.Still later Michaelis had to ask the last stranger to wait there fifteen minutes longer while he went back to his own place and made a pot of coffee.After that he stayed there alone with Wilson until dawn."
"凌晨三点左右，威尔森喃喃的胡言乱语发生了变化——他慢慢安静下来，开始说起那辆黄色的汽车。他声称自己有办法查出来那辆黄色的车到底是谁的，然后又脱口说两个月前他老婆从城里回来时，鼻青脸肿的。","About three o’clock the quality of Wilson’s incoherent muttering changed—he grew quieter and began to talk about the yellow car.He announced that he had a way of finding out whom the yellow car belonged to, and then he blurted out that a couple of months ago his wife had come from the city with her face bruised and her nose swollen."
"但当他意识到自己说了这些的时候，便又畏缩了，开始再次哭喊着叫起“我的天哪”。米凯利斯想分散他的注意力，但又显得有点拙嘴笨舌。","But when he heard himself say this, he flinched and began to cry ‘Oh, my God!’ again in his groaning voice.Mi-chaelis made a clumsy attempt to distract him."
"“你结婚有多久了，乔治？得啦，安安静静坐会儿，回答我的问题。你结婚有多久了？”","‘How long have you been married, George?Come on there, try and sit still a minute and answer my question.How long have you been married?’"
"“十二年。”","‘Twelve years.’"
"“有过孩子没？好了，乔治，安静坐着——我问你问题呢。你们有过孩子没？”","‘Ever had any children?Come on, George, sit still—I asked you a question.Did you ever have any children?’"
"棕色的硬壳甲壳虫不停地在昏暗的电灯上乱撞，每次米凯利斯听到外边有飞驰而过的汽车声时，他总觉得很像几小时前肇事逃逸的那辆车。他不想到修车间去，因为那张停放过尸体的工作台上依然留有血迹，于是他便很不自在地在办公室里走来走去——天还没亮他就已经将屋里的每一样东西都记得清清楚楚了——而且时不时就坐到威尔森身边，竭力使他平静一些。","The hard brown beetles kept thudding against the dull light and whenever Michaelis heard a car go tearing along the road outside it sounded to him like the car that hadn’t stopped a few hours before.He didn’t like to go into the garage because the work bench was stained where the body had been lying so he moved uncomfortably around the office—he knew every object in it before morning—and from time to time sat down beside Wilson trying to keep him more quiet."
"“你有没有一个经常做礼拜的教堂，乔治？也许你已经好久没有去了吧？或许我可以给那个教堂打个电话，请一位牧师过来，他可以和你谈一下，好吗？”","‘Have you got a church you go to sometimes, George?Maybe even if you haven’t been there for a long time?Maybe I could call up the church and get a priest to come over and he could talk to you, see?’"
"“我不属于任何教堂。”","‘Don’t belong to any.’"
"“你应当有个常去的教堂，乔治，碰到这种时候就有用了。你以前一定去过教堂吧。你难道不是在教堂里结的婚吗？听着，乔治，听我说。你难道不是在教堂里结的婚吗？”","‘You ought to have a church, George, for times like this.You must have gone to church once.Didn’t you get married in a church?Listen, George, listen to me.Didn’t you get married in a church?’"
"“那是很久以前的事了。”","‘That was a long time ago.’"
"因为要想着回答问题，他原先摇晃的节奏就被打乱了——他沉默了一会儿。接着，他黯淡的眼睛里再次流露出那种似懂非懂的表情。","The effort of answering broke the rhythm of his rocking—for a moment he was silent.Then the same half knowing, half bewildered look came back into his faded eyes."
"“你看那个抽屉里。”他指着那张办公桌说。","‘Look in the drawer there,’ he said, pointing at the desk."
"“哪个抽屉？”","‘Which drawer?’"
"“那个抽屉——就那个。”","‘That drawer—that one.’"
"米凯利斯打开手边最近的那只抽屉。里面没有别的，只有一根小巧却很贵重的狗链子，是用皮革和银线编织而成的。显然还是新的。“这个吗？”他举起狗链子问道。威尔森盯着看看，点了点头。","Michaelis opened the drawer nearest his hand.There was nothing in it but a small expensive dog leash made of leather and braided silver.It was apparently new.‘This?’ he inquired, holding it up.Wilson stared and nodded."
"“我是昨天下午发现的。她想方设法给我解释它的来由，但我知道这里面肯定有猫腻。”","‘I found it yesterday afternoon.She tried to tell me about it but I knew it was something funny.’"
"“你的意思是说你太太买的？”","‘You mean your wife bought it?’"
"“她用纸巾包好放在了她的梳妆台上。”","‘She had it wrapped in tissue paper on her bureau.’"
"米凯利斯也没发现这其中有什么不对劲的，于是就对威尔森说出了十多条理由，解释她老婆为什么会买这条狗链子。但可以想象，威尔森也一定从莫特尔那里听过了其中的某些理由了，因为他又开始低声哼着：“我的天哪！”——这位安慰者的那几个理由也白说了。","Michaelis didn’t see anything odd in that and he gave Wilson a dozen reasons why his wife might have bought the dog leash.But conceivably Wilson had heard some of these same explanations before, from Myrtle, because he began saying ‘Oh, my God!’ again in a whisper—his comforter left several explanations in the air."
"“那么是他杀了她。”威尔森说道，他突然将嘴巴大张开来。","‘Then he killed her,’ said Wilson.His mouth dropped open suddenly."
"“谁杀了她？”","‘Who did?’"
"“我有办法查出来。”","‘I have a way of finding out.’"
"“你在胡言乱语了，乔治。”他的这位朋友说，“你的精神受了太大的刺激，连自己在说什么都不知道了。你最好还是尽量安安静静地坐到天亮吧。”","‘You’re morbid, George,’ said his friend.‘This has been a strain to you and you don’t know what you’re saying.You’d better try and sit quiet till morning.’"
"“他谋杀了她。”","‘He murdered her.’"
"“那是一起交通事故，乔治。”","‘It was an accident, George.’"
"威尔森摇了摇头。他的眼睛眯了起来，嘴巴微微张开，不以为然地“哼”了一声。","Wilson shook his head.His eyes narrowed and his mouth widened slightly with the ghost of a superior ‘Hm!’"
"“我知道了，”他很确定地说，“我这个人很信任别人的，我不会无故伤害任何人，但是一旦我弄明白了一件事情，那就错不了。就是车里的那个男的。她跑过去想跟他说话，而他却不肯停下来。”","‘I know,’ he said definitely, ‘I’m one of these trusting fellas and I don’t think any harm to nobody, but when I get to know a thing I know it.It was the man in that car.She ran out to speak to him and he wouldn’t stop.’"
"米凯利斯当时也看到了这个场景，只是他并不觉得其中有什么特殊的意义。他觉得威尔森太太是从丈夫那里跑开的，而不是想去拦哪一辆车。“她怎么可能那样做呢？”","Michaelis had seen this too but it hadn’t occurred to him that there was any special significance in it.He believed that Mrs. Wilson had been running away from her husband, rather than trying to stop any particular car.‘How could she of been like that?’"
"“她城府很深。”威尔森说，似乎这样就回答了他的问题。“啊——呦——呦”","‘She’s a deep one,’ said Wilson, as if that answered the question.‘Ah-h-h—’"
"他又开始摇晃起来，米凯利斯站在旁边，手里的那条狗链子扭成了一团。","He began to rock again and Michaelis stood twisting the leash in his hand."
"“或许你有什么朋友，我可以给你朋友打电话，请他来帮忙吧，乔治？”","‘Maybe you got some friend that I could telephone for, George?’"
"这种希望实在是太渺茫了——他几乎可以肯定威尔森没有一个朋友，他连个老婆都对付不了。又过了一会儿，他很高兴地发现屋里有了变化，窗户边泛起了蓝光，他知道天很快就亮了。五点左右时，外边天色更蓝了，屋里都可以关灯了。","This was a forlorn hope—he was almost sure that Wilson had no friend: there was not enough of him for his wife.He was glad a little later when he noticed a change in the room, a blue quickening by the window, and realized that dawn wasn’t far off.About five o’clock it was blue enough outside to snap off the light."
"威尔森目光呆滞，转头望着外边的灰堆，那一朵朵奇形怪状的灰色小云团在黎明的微风中飘来飘去。","Wilson’s glazed eyes turned out to the ashheaps, where small grey clouds took on fantastic shape and scurried here and there in the faint dawn wind."
"“我跟她谈过了。”沉默了很久之后，他又喃喃说道，“我对她说，她可以欺骗我，但她绝对欺骗不了上帝。我把她带到窗口，”他很费力地站起来，走到后面的窗户前，把脸紧贴在窗户上，靠在那里，“然后我说：‘上帝知道你在做什么，知道你所做的一切事情。你可以欺骗我，但是你欺骗不了上帝！’”","‘I spoke to her,’ he muttered, after a long silence.‘I told her she might fool me but she couldn’t fool God.I took her to the window—’ With an effort he got up and walked to the rear window and leaned with his face pressed against it, ‘—and I said ‘God knows what you’ve been doing, everything you’ve been doing.You may fool me but you can’t fool God!’"
"米凯利斯站在他的后面，很吃惊地看着他在那里盯着T.J.埃克尔堡大夫的眼睛，那双黯淡却硕大的眼睛从渐渐消散的夜色中显现出来。","Standing behind him Michaelis saw with a shock that he was looking at the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg which had just emerged pale and enormous from the dissolving night."
"“上帝能看到一切。”威尔森又重复了一遍。“那是一幅广告牌。”米凯利斯给他确认道。他不知为什么又转过身来，朝屋里看了看。但是威尔森却在那儿站了很久，他的脸紧靠着窗户上的玻璃，朝着黎明的曙光不住地点头。","‘God sees everything,’ repeated Wilson.‘That’s an advertisement,’ Michaelis assured him.Something made him turn away from the window and look back into the room.But Wilson stood there a long time, his face close to the window pane, nodding into the twilight."
"等到六点的时候，米凯利斯已经精疲力竭，好不容易听到有一辆汽车在外边停了下来，他感到无比庆幸。来者是昨天晚上陪护者当中的一位，他答应过要回来的，于是便做了三个人的早餐，另外一个人也一起吃了早饭。威尔森现在平静了好多，米凯利斯回家去睡了一觉，四个小时后他醒了过来，便急忙跑回修车厂，却发现威尔森已经不见了。","By six o’clock Michaelis was worn out and grateful for the sound of a car stopping outside.It was one of the watchers of the night before who had promised to come back so he cooked breakfast for three which he and the other man ate together.Wilson was quieter now and Michaelis went home to sleep; when he awoke four hours later and hurried back to the garage Wilson was gone."
"他的行踪——他一直是步行的——后来被查明是先到了罗斯福港，然后又去了盖兹山，在那里他买了一块三明治，可是并没有吃，还买了一杯咖啡。他一定很累而且走得很慢，因为直到中午他才走到盖兹山。到现在为止，要解释他的行踪的相关时间并不困难——有一些男孩曾看到一个“疯疯癫癫”的男人，路上还有几个开车的记得他曾在路旁神情古怪地盯着他们看。随后的三个小时里，他就从人们的视线里消失了。警察根据他曾和米凯利斯说过的话，说他“有办法查出来”，推测他可能在那段时间去当地的修车厂挨个打听那辆黄色的汽车去了。但是没有修车厂主看到他去过——或许他有更简单可靠的办法查出自己想要知道的信息。到下午两点半的时候，他已经在西卵了，在那儿他还向人打听了怎么去盖茨比家。因此到那时他已经知道了盖茨比的名字。","His movements—he was on foot all the time—were afterward traced to Port Roosevelt and then to Gad’s Hill where he bought a sandwich that he didn’t eat and a cup of coffee.He must have been tired and walking slowly for he didn’t reach Gad’s Hill until noon.Thus far there was no difficulty in accounting for his time—there were boys who had seen a man ‘acting sort of crazy’ and motorists at whom he stared oddly from the side of the road.Then for three hours he disappeared from view.The police, on the strength of what he said to Michaelis, that he ‘had a way of finding out,’ supposed that he spent that time going from garage to garage thereabouts inquiring for a yellow car.On the other hand no garage man who had seen him ever came forward—and perhaps he had an easier, surer way of finding out what he wanted to know.By half past two he was in West Egg where he asked someone the way to Gatsby’s house.So by that time he knew Gatsby’s name."
"下午两点钟时，盖茨比穿上了游泳衣，并对男管家说，要是有人打电话给他，就到游泳池这边跟他说一声。他还去车库里拿了一个充气的橡皮垫子，这个垫子整个夏天都在供客人玩乐，司机还帮他把垫子充了气。随后他吩咐司机无论如何都不准把那辆敞篷车开出去——这很奇怪，因为车前面右侧的挡泥板需要修理。","At two o’clock Gatsby put on his bathing suit and left word with the butler that if any one phoned word was to be brought to him at the pool.He stopped at the garage for a pneumatic mattress that had amused his guests during the summer, and the chauffeur helped him pump it up.Then he gave instructions that the open car wasn’t to be taken out under any circumstances—and this was strange because the front right fender needed repair."
"他将垫子扛在肩上，向游泳池走去。他中途还有一次停下来摇摆了一下，当时司机问他是否需要帮忙，但他摇了摇头，过了一会儿便消失在那日渐变黄的树林中。","Gatsby shouldered the mattress and started for the pool.Once he stopped and shifted it a little, and the chauffeur asked him if he needed help, but he shook his head and in a moment disappeared among the yellowing trees."
"并没有人打电话过来，但是男管家没有睡觉，一直等到了四点——直到即便有电话来他也不能再接听了。我想盖茨比本人也不相信会有电话来，或许他已经不在乎了。如果他真是那样想的话，他一定感到自己已经失去了昔日那个温暖的世界，感到自己因为一直活在一个梦里而付出了惨重的代价。他一定透过令人战栗的树叶看着那片陌生的天空，当他发现玫瑰花原来是那么丑陋的时候，当他发现阳光照在刚刚抽出新芽的草坪上原来是那么残酷的时候，他不禁浑身发抖。一个崭新的世界，充满个物质，但却并不真实，这儿有着那些可怜的鬼魂，像呼吸空气一般做着梦，漫无目的地到处飘荡……就像那个灰蒙蒙的、怪异的人影，他正穿过杂乱的树木悄悄地向他走来。","No telephone message arrived but the butler went without his sleep and waited for it until four o’clock—until long after there was any one to give it to if it came.I have an idea that Gatsby himself didn’t believe it would come and perhaps he no longer cared.If that was true he must have felt that he had lost the old warm world, paid a high price for living too long with a single dream.He must have looked up at an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and shivered as he found what a grotesque thing a rose is and how raw the sunlight was upon the scarcely created grass.A new world, material without being real, where poor ghosts, breathing dreams like air, drifted fortuitously about... like that ashen, fantastic figure gliding toward him through the amorphous trees."
"那个司机——他是沃尔夫山姆手下的一个人——听到了枪响。后来他说当时自己也并没有在意这些。我从火车站直接开车到了盖茨比的家里，等我慌慌张张地冲上前面的台阶时，他们才感到出事了。但是我认为当时他们肯定都知道了。我们四个人，司机、男管家、园丁和我，一句话也没说就急忙跑到游泳池边。","The chauffeur—he was one of Wolfshiem’s protégés—heard the shots—afterward he could only say that he hadn’t thought anything much about them.I drove from the station directly to Gatsby’s house and my rushing anxiously up the front steps was the first thing that alarmed any one.But they knew then, I firmly believe.With scarcely a word said, four of us, the chauffeur, butler, gardener and I, hurried down to the pool."
"清新的水从游泳池的一端流进来，然后又向另一端的排水口流去，水面上微微泛起几乎都察觉不到的涟漪。随着微微泛起的涟漪，那个载有重负的气垫在游泳池里毫无规律地漂着。连水都吹不动的一阵清风就足以让那只偶然负重的气垫随意地漂动。一堆落叶使它缓缓转动起来，如罗盘的指针一般，在水上勾画出一道细细的红圈儿。","There was a faint, barely perceptible movement of the water as the fresh flow from one end urged its way toward the drain at the other.With little ripples that were hardly the shadows of waves, the laden mattress moved irregularly down the pool.A small gust of wind that scarcely corrugated the surface was enough to disturb its accidental course with its accidental burden.The touch of a cluster of leaves revolved it slowly, tracing, like the leg of compass, a thin red circle in the water."
"我们抬起盖茨比朝房子走去的时候，园丁在不远处的草地上看到了威尔森的尸体，于是这场屠杀就此结束了。","It was after we started with Gatsby toward the house that the gardener saw Wilson’s body a little way off in the grass, and the holocaust was complete."
"第九章","Chapter 9"
"事隔两年，我依然记得，出事那天余下的时间、晚上还有第二天，络绎不绝的警察、摄影师和媒体记者都在盖茨比家的前门进进出出。正门口拉了一根绳子，一个警察站在旁边不让那些看热闹的人进来，但是小男孩们很快就发现他们可以从我家院子绕进去，于是总有那么几个孩子嘴巴大张着围在游泳池旁。那天下午，一个煞有介事的人，或许是一名侦探，俯身查看威尔森的尸体时说了“疯子”这个词，于是他那颇具权威的语气竟然成了第二天各大报纸报道的调调。","After two years I remember the rest of that day, and that night and the next day, only as an endless drill of police and photographers and newspaper men in and out of Gatsby’s front door.A rope stretched across the main gate and a policeman by it kept out the curious, but little boys soon discovered that they could enter through my yard and there were always a few of them clustered open-mouthed about the pool.Someone with a positive manner, perhaps a detective, used the expression ‘mad man’ as he bent over Wilson’s body that afternoon, and the adventitious authority of his voice set the key for the newspaper reports next morning."
"多数报道都仿佛噩梦一般——离奇古怪、捕风捉影、尖酸刻薄且全然失真。米凯利斯在验尸时透露说威尔森怀疑他的妻子有外遇，那时我还以为整个事件很快就会被添油加醋地写成讽刺作品——不料凯瑟琳，这个本来可能会站出来说点什么的人，现在却保持沉默了。她对这一事件也表现出惊人的坚强——她的两道描过的眉毛下那双坚毅的眼睛直视着验尸官，发誓说她姐姐从来就没见过盖茨比，还说她姐姐和她姐夫在一起生活得非常美满，而且她姐姐从来都没有什么出轨行为。她说得连自己都信以为真了，便用手帕捂着脸痛苦起来，仿佛这样的质疑让她无法忍受。因此，威尔森就被归结为一个“因悲伤过度而精神失常”的人。这样，这个案子的案情就可以保持简单明了。于是，案子也就这样了结了。","Most of those reports were a nightmare—grotesque, circumstantial, eager and untrue.When Michaelis’s testimony at the inquest brought to light Wilson’s suspicions of his wife I thought the whole tale would shortly be served up in racy pasquinade—but Catherine, who might have said anything, didn’t say a word.She showed a surprising amount of character about it too—looked at the coroner with determined eyes under that corrected brow of hers and swore that her sister had never seen Gatsby, that her sister was completely happy with her husband, that her sister had been into no mischief whatever.She convinced herself of it and cried into her handkerchief as if the very suggestion was more than she could endure.So Wilson was reduced to a man ‘deranged by grief’ in order that the case might remain in its simplest form.And it rested there."
"但是事情的这部分似乎统统都显得细微而无关紧要。我发现自己是站在盖茨比一边的，而且是孤身一人。从我打电话到西卵村报告惨案的那一刻起，所有的猜测，所有相关的实际问题，统统都提到我这里来了。起初我既惊讶又困惑，后来，一个小时接着一个小时过去了，他还是躺在房间里，一动不动，没有呼吸，安安静静地，我才渐渐明白了自己的责任，因为除了我之外，再没有哪个人会对此感兴趣——我所说的兴趣，是指每个人在死后都有权利或多或少得到些来自于别人的热切的关心。","But all this part of it seemed remote and unessential.I found myself on Gatsby’s side, and alone.From the moment I telephoned news of the catastrophe to West Egg village, every surmise about him, and every practical question, was referred to me.At first I was surprised and confused; then, as he lay in his house and didn’t move or breathe or speak hour upon hour it grew upon me that I was responsible, because no one else was interested—interested, I mean, with that intense personal interest to which every one has some vague right at the end."
"我们发现他半个小时后，我就给黛西打了电话，完全出自于本能，而且毫不犹豫就给她打了电话。但是她和汤姆那天下午很早就出门了，还随身带了行李。","I called up Daisy half an hour after we found him, called her instinctively and without hesitation.But she and Tom had gone away early that afternoon, and taken baggage with them."
"“没有留地址吗？”","‘Left no address?’"
"“没有。”","‘No.’"
"“说没说他们什么时候回来啊？”","‘Say when they’d be back?’"
"“没有。”","‘No.’"
"“知道他们去哪儿了吗？我怎样才能和他们取得联系呢？”“我不知道。说不上来。”","‘Any idea where they are?How I could reach them?’‘I don’t know.Can’t say.’"
"我想给他找个人来。我很想走进他躺着的那间屋子里去安慰他说：“我会给你找个人来的，盖茨比。别担心。只要相信我，我会给你找个人来……”","I wanted to get somebody for him.I wanted to go into the room where he lay and reassure him: ‘I’ll get somebody for you, Gatsby.Don’t worry.Just trust me and I’ll get somebody for you—’"
"迈耶·沃尔夫山姆的名字并不在电话薄里。男管家把他在百老汇的办公室地址告诉了我，我便打电话去电话局咨询，可是等到我得到电话号码的时候，早就过了五点，已经没有人接电话了。","Meyer Wolfshiem’s name wasn’t in the phone book.The butler gave me his office address on Broadway and I called Information, but by the time I had the number it was long after five and no one answered the phone."
"“您能再接一下吗？”","‘Will you ring again?’"
"“我已经接过三次了。”","‘I’ve rung them three times.’"
"“有非常重要的事。”","‘It’s very important.’"
"“对不起。恐怕那边没人。”","‘Sorry.I’m afraid no one’s there.’"
"我回到客厅的时候，屋里忽然站满了官方人员。最初一瞬间，我还以为他们是一些不速之客。但是当他们掀开被单，满眼冷漠地盯着盖茨比的时候，他的抗议声一直在我的脑海中回荡：","I went back to the drawing room and thought for an instant that they were chance visitors, all these official people who suddenly filled it.But as they drew back the sheet and looked at Gatsby with unmoved eyes, his protest continued in my brain."
"“我说，老兄，你得替我找个人来。你必须想想办法。我不能一个人在这儿孤零零地受罪。”","‘Look here, old sport, you’ve got to get somebody for me.You’ve got to try hard.I can’t go through this alone.’"
"有人开始问我问题了，而我却摆脱了他们跑到楼上来，匆匆忙忙地翻看他书桌上那些没锁上的抽屉——他从来都没明确告诉过我他的父母已经去世了。但是我什么都没找到——只有一张丹·科迪的照片，那已经被人遗忘的狂野的象征，从墙上向下凝望着。","Some one started to ask me questions but I broke away and going upstairs looked hastily through the unlocked parts of his desk—he’d never told me definitely that his parents were dead.But there was nothing—only the picture of Dan Cody, a token of forgotten violence staring down from the wall."
"第二天早上，我让男管家去纽约给沃尔夫山姆送了一封信，信中向他询问了一些情况，并恳请他搭乘下一班火车过来。写的时候，我就觉得这个请求显得有点多余。我满以为他看了报纸就会马上赶来，正如我也相信黛西肯定会在中午之前来电报一样——但是电报没来，沃尔夫山姆先生也没到。除了那些不断涌来的警察、摄影师和媒体记者之外，没有什么人来。当男管家将沃尔夫山姆的回信带回来的时候，我的心中开始萌生一种蔑视，感觉盖茨比和我站在一起，横眉冷对所有的这些人们。“亲爱的卡拉韦先生，这个消息令我震惊万分，我几乎都不敢相信这是真的。那个人的此种疯狂的举动不得不引起我们大家的深思。我现在由于要处理一些非常重要的业务，所以无法赶过去，也不能被牵连进这件事中去。稍后如果有什么需要我帮忙的，就让埃德加送信通知我。听到这样的消息，我简直有点不知自己身在何处，而且彻底被击垮了。","Next morning I sent the butler to New York with a letter to Wolfshiem which asked for information and urged him to come out on the next train.That request seemed superfluous when I wrote it.I was sure he’d start when he saw the newspapers, just as I was sure there’d be a wire from Daisy before noon—but neither a wire nor Mr. Wolfshiem arrived, no one arrived except more police and photographers and newspaper men.When the butler brought back Wolfshiem’s answer I began to have a feeling of defiance, of scornful solidarity between Gatsby and me against them all.Dear Mr. Carraway.This has been one of the most terrible shocks of my life to me I hardly can believe it that it is true at all.Such a mad act as that man did should make us all think.I cannot come down now as I am tied up in some very important business and cannot get mixed up in this thing now.If there is anything I can do a little later let me know in a letter by Edgar.I hardly know where I am when I hear about a thing like this and am completely knocked down and out."
"您真诚的，迈耶·沃尔夫山姆。”接着下面附有：","Yours truly MEYER WOLFSHIEM and then hasty addenda beneath:"
"“葬礼相关事宜请告知。又及：根本不认识其家人。”","Let me know about the funeral etc do not know his family at all."
"那天下午电话响了，长途台说是从芝加哥打来的，我想黛西终于来电话了。但是接通后却是一个男人的声音，听起来很单薄、很远。","When the phone rang that afternoon and Long Distance said Chicago was calling I thought this would be Daisy at last.But the connection came through as a man’s voice, very thin and far away."
"“我是斯莱格尔……”","‘This is Slagle speaking....’"
"“什么事？”这个名字听上去有点陌生。","‘Yes?’The name was unfamiliar."
"“那封信出事了，对不？收到我的电报没？”","‘Hell of a note, isn’t it?Get my wire?’"
"“没有收到什么电报啊。”","‘There haven’t been any wires.’"
"“小帕克出事了。”他急速地说道，“他在柜台交易债券的时候被当场抓获。他们五分钟之前从纽约得到的消息，知道了号码。这种事你想得到吗？在这种乡下地方，你根本就预料不到……”“喂！”我屏住呼吸打断他的话，“你听我说——我不是盖茨比先生。盖茨比先生死了。”","‘Young Parke’s in trouble,’ he said rapidly.‘They picked him up when he handed the bonds over the counter.They got a circular from New York giving ‘em the numbers just five minutes before.What d’you know about that, hey?You never can tell in these hick towns—’ ‘Hello!’I interrupted breathlessly.‘Look here—this isn’t Mr. Gatsby.Mr. Gatsby’s dead.’"
"电话那头沉默了好久，接着是一声惊叫……随后啪的一声便将电话挂断了。","There was a long silence on the other end of the wire, followed by an exclamation... then a quick squawk as the connection was broken."
"我想大概是在第三天的时候，从明尼苏达州的一个小镇寄来一封署名为亨利·C. 盖茨的电报。上面说发电报的人马上就动身，并要求将葬礼推迟到他来后再办。","I think it was on the third day that a telegram signed Henry C. Gatz arrived from a town in Minnesota.It said only that the sender was leaving immediately and to postpone the funeral until he came."
"来者是盖茨比的父亲，一个表情严肃、神情无助而沮丧的老人，这样温暖的九月天，他身上却裹着一件廉价的长外套。他激动得眼泪不住地往下流，当我从他的手中接过包裹和雨伞的时候，他一个劲儿地扯着稀稀拉拉的白胡子，我好不容易才帮他把大衣脱了下来。他几乎就撑不住了，于是我一面把他带到音乐厅让他坐下，一面叫人弄点吃的过来。但是他却不肯吃，那杯牛奶从他颤颤巍巍的手里洒了出来。","It was Gatsby’s father, a solemn old man very helpless and dismayed, bundled up in a long cheap ulster against the warm September day.His eyes leaked continuously with excitement and when I took the bag and umbrella from his hands he began to pull so incessantly at his sparse grey beard that I had difficulty in getting off his coat.He was on the point of collapse so I took him into the music room and made him sit down while I sent for something to eat.But he wouldn’t eat and the glass of milk spilled from his trembling hand."
"“我是从芝加哥的报纸上看到的。”他说，“芝加哥的报纸上全都登出来了。看后我就马上动身了。”","‘I saw it in the Chicago newspaper,’ he said.‘It was all in the Chicago newspaper.I started right away.’"
"“我不知道怎样联系您。”","‘I didn’t know how to reach you.’"
"他的眼睛不停地屋内四处张望着，却又什么都没看到。","His eyes, seeing nothing, moved ceaselessly about the room."
"“是一个疯子干的。”他说，“他一定是疯了。”","‘It was a mad man,’ he said.‘He must have been mad.’"
"“您喝杯咖啡好吗？”我劝慰他说。","‘Wouldn’t you like some coffee?’I urged him."
"“我什么都不要。我现在就很好了，您是……”","‘I don’t want anything.I’m all right now, Mr.—’"
"“卡拉韦。”","‘Carraway.’"
"“嗯，我现在很好。他们把吉米放在哪儿了？”我把他带到客厅里停放着他儿子尸体的地方，然后就走开了。一些小男孩爬上了台阶，正在朝门厅里张望。等我告诉他们是谁来了时，他们才极不情愿地离开了。","‘Well, I’m all right now.Where have they got Jimmy?’I took him into the drawing-room, where his son lay, and left him there.Some little boys had come up on the steps and were looking into the hall; when I told them who had arrived they went reluctantly away."
"过了一小会儿，盖兹先生开门走了出来，他的嘴巴微微张开，脸有点泛红，眼睛时不时会滴几滴泪下来。他到了这个年纪已经不会把死看作是什么令人惊恐万分的事情了。这时，他第一次向四周望去，看到了那高大而华贵的门厅，看到了门厅周边的一间间大房间通向其他的很多房间，于是他的悲伤中开始掺杂进一种惊讶与自豪。我扶他来到楼上的卧室，他脱着外套和马甲的时候，我告诉他所有的安排都推迟了，只等他来后再决定。","After a little while Mr. Gatz opened the door and came out, his mouth ajar, his face flushed slightly, his eyes leaking isolated and unpunctual tears.He had reached an age where death no longer has the quality of ghastly surprise, and when he looked around him now for the first time and saw the height and splendor of the hall and the great rooms opening out from it into other rooms his grief began to be mixed with an awed pride.I helped him to a bedroom upstairs; while he took off his coat and vest I told him that all arrangements had been deferred until he came."
"“我不知道您想怎么办，盖茨比先生……”","‘I didn’t know what you’d want, Mr. Gatsby—’"
"“我姓盖茨。”","‘Gatz is my name.’"
"“盖茨先生，我想您也许想把遗体运到西部去。”","‘—Mr. Gatz.I thought you might want to take the body west.’"
"他摇了摇头：","He shook his head."
"“吉米一向更喜欢东部。他是在东部出人头地，有了今天的地位。你是我儿子的朋友吗，先生？”“我们是很要好的朋友。”","‘Jimmy always liked it better down East.He rose up to his position in the East.Were you a friend of my boy’s, Mr.—?’‘We were close friends.’"
"“他是大有前途啊，你也知道。他还很年轻，但是他脑子这儿很好使。”","‘He had a big future before him, you know.He was only a young man but he had a lot of brain power here.’"
"他郑重其事地用手碰了碰脑袋，我也点了点头。","He touched his head impressively and I nodded."
"“如果他能活下来的话，他会成为一个了不起的人。像詹姆斯·J. 希尔那样的人，他会为国家发展出力。”","‘If he’d of lived he’d of been a great man.A man like James J. Hill.He’d of helped build up the country.’"
"“确实如此。”我很不自在地说道。","‘That’s true,’ I said, uncomfortably."
"他笨手笨脚地扯了扯绣花床单，试图想把它从床上取下来，接着便直挺挺地躺了下去——很快就睡着了。","He fumbled at the embroidered coverlet, trying to take it from the bed, and lay down stiffly—was instantly asleep."
"那天晚上，一个明显受了惊吓的人打电话过来，非要先知道我是谁才肯告诉我他的名字。","That night an obviously frightened person called up and demanded to know who I was before he would give his name."
"“我是卡拉韦。”我说。","‘This is Mr. Carraway,’ I said."
"“哦！”他听起来好像是松了一口气，“我是克里普斯普林格。”","‘Oh—’ He sounded relieved.‘This is Klipspringer.’"
"我也松了一口气，因为这似乎意味着盖茨比下葬时墓前能多一个朋友。我不想将此登报，引来一大帮看热闹的人，所以我就自己打电话通知了几个人。他们可真是难找。","I was relieved too for that seemed to promise another friend at Gatsby’s grave.I didn’t want it to be in the papers and draw a sightseeing crowd so I’d been calling up a few people myself.They were hard to find."
"“明天举行葬礼。”我说，“下午三点，就在他家。我希望你能转告所有有意参与的人。”","‘The funeral’s tomorrow,’ I said.‘Three o’clock, here at the house.I wish you’d tell anybody who’d be interested.’"
"“哦，我会的。”他急忙说道，“当然我不大可能见到什么人，但是如果能碰到的话，我会转告的。”","‘Oh, I will,’ he broke out hastily.‘Of course I’m not likely to see anybody, but if I do.’"
"他的语气让我产生了疑虑：","His tone made me suspicious."
"“您本人当然是要来的。”","‘Of course you’ll be there yourself.’"
"“嗯，我当然会尽力的。我打电话来是要问……”","‘Well, I’ll certainly try.What I called up about is—’"
"“等一下，”我打断他的话，“先确定你要来，怎么样？”","‘Wait a minute,’ I interrupted.‘How about saying you’ll come?’"
"“嗯，事情是……实际情况是这样的，我现在在格林尼治的朋友家里，他们希望我明天能留下来陪他们。实际上，他们明天要去野餐什么的。当然我会尽力脱身的。”","‘Well, the fact is—the truth of the matter is that I’m staying with some people up here in Greenwich and they rather expect me to be with them tomorrow.In fact there’s a sort of picnic or something.Of course I’ll do my very best to get away.’"
"我毫不掩饰地突然“哼”了一声，他一定也听到了，因为他继续往下说的时候显得有点紧张。","I ejaculated an unrestrained ‘Huh!’ and he must have heard me for he went on nervously:"
"“我打电话过来是为了我以前留在那儿的一双鞋。不知能否麻烦您让男管家帮我寄过来。您知道，那是双网球鞋，离开了它们我还真是不方便。我的地址是B. F.……”","‘What I called up about was a pair of shoes I left there.I wonder if it’d be too much trouble to have the butler send them on.You see they’re tennis shoes and I’m sort of help—less without them.My address is care of B. F.—’"
"我没再往下听他的地址，便把话筒挂上了。","I didn’t hear the rest of the name because I hung up the receiver."
"此后，我为盖茨比而感到遗憾——还有一位我打过电话的先生，他暗示盖茨比罪有应得。但是反过来我也有错，因为他就是当初在盖茨比家里借着酒劲对盖茨比极力冷嘲热讽的那帮人中的一个，我本来就该放聪明点，别打电话给他。","After that I felt a certain shame for Gatsby—one gentleman to whom I telephoned implied that he had got what he deserved.However, that was my fault, for he was one of those who used to sneer most bitterly at Gatsby on the courage of Gatsby’s liquor and I should have known better than to call him."
"举行葬礼的那天早上，我去纽约找迈耶·沃尔夫山姆，好像也没有别的办法可以找得到他了。经一个电梯工指路，我来到一扇写着“十字控股公司”的门前，将门推开后，起先屋里好像没有一个人。我大声喊了几声“喂”，也没有人应答。可就在这时，突然从一块隔板后传来一阵争论声，接着里面一个门口出现了一个漂亮的犹太女人，她用那双充满敌意的黑眼睛将我打量了一番。","The morning of the funeral I went up to New York to see Meyer Wolfshiem; I couldn’t seem to reach him any other way.The door that I pushed open on the advice of an elevator boy was marked ‘The Swastika Holding Company’ and at first there didn’t seem to be any one inside.But when I’d shouted ‘Hello’ several times in vain an argument broke out behind a partition and presently a lovely Jewess appeared at an interior door and scrutinized me with black hostile eyes."
"“里面没有人。”她说，“沃尔夫山姆先生去芝加哥了。”","‘Nobody’s in,’ she said.‘Mr. Wolfshiem’s gone to Chicago.’"
"她的前半句话明显在撒谎，因为里面已经有人不成调地吹起了《玫瑰经》的口哨。","The first part of this was obviously untrue for someone had begun to whistle ‘The Rosary,’ tunelessly, inside."
"“请告诉他卡拉韦想见他。”","‘Please say that Mr. Carraway wants to see him.’"
"“我总不能把他从芝加哥叫回来，对不？”","‘I can’t get him back from Chicago, can I?’"
"这时有一个声音，毫无疑问是沃尔夫山姆的声音，从门的那边喊了一声“斯特拉”。","At this moment a voice, unmistakably Wolfshiem’s called ‘Stella!’ from the other side of the door."
"“在桌上留一下你的名字。”她快速说道，“他回来后我转告他。”","‘Leave your name on the desk,’ she said quickly.‘I’ll give it to him when he gets back.’"
"“但是我知道他就在这儿。”她朝我这边跨了一步，开始愤怒地将两只手在臀部上下滑动，","‘But I know he’s there.’She took a step toward me and began to slide her hands indignantly up and down her hips."
"“你们这些年轻人自以为随时都可以闯进来。”她训斥道，“我们对此已经深恶痛绝了。我说他在芝加哥，那他就是在芝加哥。”","‘You young men think you can force your way in here any time,’ she scolded.‘We’re getting sickantired of it.When I say he’s in Chicago, he’s in ChiCAgo.’"
"我提到了盖茨比。","I mentioned Gatsby."
"“哦……啊！”她又仔细打量了我一番，“请您……您贵姓？”","‘Oh—h!’She looked at me over again.‘Will you just—what was your name?’"
"她忽地不见了。过了一会儿，迈耶·沃尔夫山姆神情严肃地站在门口，向我伸出了双臂。他把我拉进办公室，同时非常虔诚地说这种时候我们大家都很伤心，一边说一边递给我一支雪茄烟。","She vanished.In a moment Meyer Wolfshiem stood solemnly in the doorway, holding out both hands.He drew me into his office, remarking in a reverent voice that it was a sad time for all of us, and offered me a cigar."
"“我想起了第一次见到他时的情景。”他说，“一个刚从部队出来的年轻少校，胸前挂满了战争期间获得的勋章。他经济拮据，因为买不起便装，所以不得不一直穿着那套军装。我第一次见到他的时候，他正在四十三号街瓦恩布雷纳的弹子房找工作。他已经有两天没吃东西了。‘走吧，和我一起去吃午饭。’我说。他半个小时便将四美元多的东西吃光了。”","‘My memory goes back to when I first met him,’ he said.‘A young major just out of the army and covered over with medals he got in the war.He was so hard up he had to keep on wearing his uniform because he couldn’t buy some regular clothes.First time I saw him was when he come into Winebrenner’s poolroom at Forty-third Street and asked for a job.He hadn’t eat anything for a couple of days.‘Come on have some lunch with me,’ I said.He ate more than four dollars’ worth of food in half an hour.’"
"“是你帮他起家做生意的吗？”我问道。","‘Did you start him in business?’I inquired."
"“帮他起家！是我一手造就了他。”","‘Start him!I made him.’"
"“哦。”","‘Oh.’"
"“我帮着他白手起家，脱贫致富的。我一眼就看出他是个一表人才、风度翩翩的年轻人，而当他告诉我他上过牛津的时候，我就知道他这个人可以成大事。我让他加入了美国退伍军人协会，而且他当时在那里还挺有威望的。很快他就在奥尔巴尼给我的一个客户办了件事。不论干什么，我们俩都像这个一样亲密无间，”他伸出两根粗胖的指头，“总是在一起。”","‘I raised him up out of nothing, right out of the gutter.I saw right away he was a fine appearing, gentlemanly young man, and when he told me he was an Oggsford I knew I could use him good.I got him to join up in the American Legion and he used to stand high there.Right off he did some work for a client of mine up to Albany.We were so thick like that in everything—’ He held up two bulbous fingers ‘—always together.’"
"我心里很想知道，这种合伙关系是否也包括1919年世界棒球联赛的那笔交易。","I wondered if this partnership had included the World’s Series transaction in 1919."
"“现在他死了。”过了一会儿，我说道，“你是他生前最亲密的朋友，因此我想你今天下午一定会来参加他的葬礼的。”","‘Now he’s dead,’ I said after a moment.‘You were his closest friend, so I know you’ll want to come to his funeral this afternoon.’"
"“我很想来。”","‘I’d like to come.’"
"“那就来呀。”","‘Well, come then.’"
"他摇了摇头，鼻毛轻轻抖了抖，眼睛里满是泪水：","The hair in his nostrils quivered slightly and as he shook his head his eyes filled with tears."
"“我不能去……我不能被牵连进去。”他说。","‘I can’t do it—I can’t get mixed up in it,’ he said."
"“没有什么可牵连的。现在一切都结束了。”","‘There’s nothing to get mixed up in.It’s all over now.’"
"“凡是有人被杀害的时候，我从不来都不想让自己受任何的牵连。我要置身事外。而我年轻的时候就不是这样的——如果我有朋友死了，无论如何，我都会陪他们一起坚持到最后。你可能觉得那样有点感情用事，但是我说到做到——坚持搏到最后。”","‘When a man gets killed I never like to get mixed up in it in any way.I keep out.When I was a young man it was different—if a friend of mine died, no matter how, I stuck with them to the end.You may think that’s sentimental but I mean it—to the bitter end.’"
"我看出来他是决意不来了，他自有自己的原因，于是我便站了起来。","I saw that for some reason of his own he was determined not to come, so I stood up."
"“你上过大学没？”他突然问道。","‘Are you a college man?’ he inquired suddenly."
"那会儿，我还以为他要拉点什么“关系”出来，但他只是点点头，又握了握我的手。","For a moment I thought he was going to suggest a ‘gon-negtion’ but he only nodded and shook my hand."
"“我们要学会在人活着的时候讲交情，而不是等他死了之后。”他建议说道，“等人去世了，我个人的原则是不管闲事。”","‘Let us learn to show our friendship for a man when he is alive and not after he is dead,’ he suggested.‘After that my own rule is to let everything alone.’"
"从他的办公室出来，天色已经变暗了，我冒着蒙蒙细雨回到了西卵。换过衣服之后，我来到隔壁，发现盖兹先生正在大厅里激动地踱来踱去。他对儿子以及儿子的财产的那种自豪感在不断增长，而现在他有东西要给我看。","When I left his office the sky had turned dark and I got back to West Egg in a drizzle.After changing my clothes I went next door and found Mr. Gatz walking up and down excitedly in the hall.His pride in his son and in his son’s possessions was continually increasing and now he had something to show me."
"“吉米给我寄了这张照片。”他手指颤抖着掏出了钱包，“看这个。”","‘Jimmy sent me this picture.’He took out his wallet with trembling fingers.‘Look there.’"
"那是这座房子的一张照片，角上都破裂了，上面满是手印。他非常急切地将细节处一一指给我看，“看这儿！”接着，他又在我的眼里寻找赞赏之情。他时不时就会将照片拿出来给人家看，我想照片对他来说也许要比房子本身显得更真实一些。","It was a photograph of the house, cracked in the corners and dirty with many hands.He pointed out every detail to me eagerly.‘Look there!’ and then sought admiration from my eyes.He had shown it so often that I think it was more real to him now than the house itself."
"“这是吉米寄给我的。我觉得这张照片非常漂亮。照得很好。”","‘Jimmy sent it to me.I think it’s a very pretty picture.It shows up well.’"
"“非常好。你最近见过他吗？”","‘Very well.Had you seen him lately?’"
"“他两年前回去看我，给我买了我现在住的房子。当然他离家出走之时，我们都非常难过，但现在我明白了他那样做是有道理的。他知道自己的前程远大，而且他成功之后对我一直很慷慨。”","‘He come out to see me two years ago and bought me the house I live in now.Of course we was broke up when he run off from home but I see now there was a reason for it.He knew he had a big future in front of him.And ever since he made a success he was very generous with me.’"
"他似乎很不舍得将照片收起来，便拿在手里极其依依不舍地在我的眼前晃了一会儿。然后，他将钱包放了回去，从口袋里掏出一本破烂不堪的旧书，书名是《霍普郎·卡西迪》：","He seemed reluctant to put away the picture, held it for another minute, lingeringly, before my eyes.Then he returned the wallet and pulled from his pocket a ragged old copy of a book called ‘Hopalong Cassidy.’"
"“看这个，这是他小时候的一本书。看了它你就明白了。”","‘Look here, this is a book he had when he was a boy.It just shows you.’"
"他翻开书的封底并转过来让我看。在最后一面空白页上工工整整写着“作息时间表”几个字，还有日期：1906年九月十二日。下面写着：起床　　　上午6:00","He opened it at the back cover and turned it around for me to see.On the last fly-leaf was printed the word SCHEDULE, and the date September 12th, 1906.And underneath: Rise from bed................6.00 A.M. "

"“看了它就明白了。”","‘It just shows you.’"
"“吉米注定了是要出人头地的。他总是有类似的决心或此类方法。你有没有注意到他是用什么方法来提高自己的心智的？他在这方面一向都是很棒的。他有一次说我吃饭的时候像猪一样，我还为此揍了他一顿。”","‘Jimmy was bound to get ahead.He always had some resolves like this or something.Do you notice what he’s got about improving his mind?He was always great for that.He told me I ate like a hog once and I beat him for it.’"
"他不愿将书合上，大声读着每一条，还热切地看着我。我觉得他非常期望我能将那张表抄下来以备己用。","He was reluctant to close the book, reading each item aloud and then looking eagerly at me.I think he rather expected me to copy down the list for my own use."
"快到三点的时候，路德教的牧师从弗拉兴来了，而我也开始不自觉地一直向窗外张望，看有没有其他汽车过来。盖茨比的父亲也同样一直张望着。时间一点点过去了，佣人都进到屋内在大厅里等候，老人家开始心神不定地眨着眼睛，同时又焦虑不安地谈着这场雨。牧师瞅了好几次表。于是，我把他叫到一边，让他再等半个小时。但是这毫不管用。还是没有一个人来。","A little before three the Lutheran minister arrived from Flushing and I began to look involuntarily out the windows for other cars.So did Gatsby’s father.And as the time passed and the servants came in and stood waiting in the hall, his eyes began to blink anxiously and he spoke of the rain in a worried uncertain way.The minister glanced several times at his watch so I took him aside and asked him to wait for half an hour.But it wasn’t any use.Nobody came."
"大约五点钟，我们的三辆汽车排成一队开到墓地，然后在绵绵细雨中停在了大门旁——第一辆汽车是灵车，又黑又湿，很可怖；随后是盖兹先生、牧师和我乘坐的大型轿车，再后面一点是盖茨比的旅行车，里面坐着四五个佣人和从西卵过来的邮差，大家浑身都湿透了。正当我们穿过大门走进墓地的时候，我听到后面有辆车停了下来，接着又听到满是积水的泥路上有人向我们追了过来。我向四处看了一下，原来是那位戴猫头鹰眼镜的先生，他就是三个月前的那个晚上我在图书馆碰上的那位对盖茨比的图书大加赞赏的先生。","About five o’clock our procession of three cars reached the cemetery and stopped in a thick drizzle beside the gate—first a motor hearse, horribly black and wet, then Mr. Gatz and the minister and I in the limousine, and, a little later, four or five servants and the postman from West Egg in Gatsby’s station wagon, all wet to the skin.As we started through the gate into the cemetery I heard a car stop and then the sound of someone splashing after us over the soggy ground.I looked around.It was the man with owl-eyed glasses whom I had found marvelling over Gatsby’s books in the library one night three months before."
"从那以后我再也没有见过他。我不知道他是怎么知道今天的葬礼的，甚至连他的名字也不知道。雨水顺着他那厚重的镜片淌了下来，于是他便将眼镜摘下来擦一擦，然后看着那块挡雨帆布在盖茨比墓上展开。","I’d never seen him since then.I don’t know how he knew about the funeral or even his name.The rain poured down his thick glasses and he took them off and wiped them to see the protecting canvas unrolled from Gatsby’s grave."
"那时我努力回忆着盖茨比，但他已经远远离去了。我只记得黛西，她既没发唁电，也没送一束花，但我并不为此而恼怒。我隐约听到有人在轻声祈祷：“愿雨中的逝者安息。”接着那位戴着猫头鹰眼镜的先生用无畏的声音说了一句：“阿门！”","I tried to think about Gatsby then for a moment but he was already too far away and I could only remember, without resentment, that Daisy hadn’t sent a message or a flower.Dimly I heard someone murmur ‘Blessed are the dead that the rain falls on,’ and then the owl-eyed man said ‘Amen to that,’ in a brave voice."
"我们冒着雨踉踉跄跄地向车子快速跑去。猫头鹰眼镜先生在门口和我说了几句话。","We straggled down quickly through the rain to the cars.Owl-Eyes spoke to me by the gate."
"“我没能赶到他房子那边。”他说。“其他人也同样没去。”","‘I couldn’t get to the house,’ he remarked.‘Neither could anybody else.’"
"“什么！”他惊叫道，“啊，我的天哪！他们过去一来可是几百人啊。”","‘Go on!’He started.‘Why, my God!they used to go there by the hundreds.’"
"他把眼镜摘了下来，里里外外又擦了一遍。","He took off his glasses and wiped them again outside and in."
"“这家伙真他妈的可怜。”他说。","‘The poor son-of-a-bitch,’ he said."
"我依旧清晰记得圣诞节之际从预科学校以及后来从大学回到西部的情景。那些去芝加哥以外地方的同学，总会约好在十二月某个傍晚六点钟在那座古老而昏暗的联邦车站聚合，在那里他们与已经沉浸于节日的快乐气氛中的那些芝加哥同学匆匆话别。我记得那些从某某私立女校回来的女孩的皮大衣、寒冷的空气中的聊天声，还有看到熟人时那高高挥起的手，以及相互比拼自己收到的邀请：“你要去奥德韦家吗？赫西家呢？舒尔茨家呢？”还有那戴着手套的手心里紧攥着的一长串绿色车票。最后还有芝加哥－密尔沃基—圣保罗路上的那些暗黄色的客车，他们停在站台门口的轨道上，看上去向圣诞节一样令人愉悦。","One of my most vivid memories is of coming back west from prep school and later from college at Christmas time.Those who went farther than Chicago would gather in the old dim Union Station at six o’clock of a December evening with a few Chicago friends already caught up into their own holiday gayeties to bid them a hasty goodbye.I remember the fur coats of the girls returning from Miss This or That’s and the chatter of frozen breath and the hands waving overhead as we caught sight of old acquaintances and the matchings of invitations: ‘Are you going to the Ordways’?the Herseys’?the Schultzes’?’ and the long green tickets clasped tight in our gloved hands.And last the murky yellow cars of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad looking cheerful as Christmas itself on the tracks beside the gate."
"当我们的列车开出车站，在冬日的夜晚奔驰于皑皑白雪之中，那属于我们的白雪在我们两边向远处伸展而去。雪在车窗上闪烁着，威斯康星那些小车站里昏黄的灯光一闪而过，空气中忽地迎面扑来一股清爽的寒气。晚饭后，我们穿过冷冷的火车通廊往回走的时候，一路深深呼吸着清爽的寒气，在那奇妙的一小时中，我们无法用言语表达地意识到自己和这个国家之间的认同感，随后便不留痕迹地再次融入到其中。","When we pulled out into the winter night and the real snow, our snow, began to stretch out beside us and twinkle against the windows, and the dim lights of small Wisconsin stations moved by, a sharp wild brace came suddenly into the air.We drew in deep breaths of it as we walked back from dinner through the cold vestibules, unutterably aware of our identity with this country for one strange hour before we melted indistinguishably into it again."
"这就是我的中西部——不是麦田，不是草原，也不是荒凉的瑞典移民城镇，而是我年轻时候乘坐的那一辆辆激动人心的返乡火车，是那寒夜里的街灯和雪橇铃声，是圣诞的冬青花环被窗内的灯光映到雪地上的影子。我是其中的一部分，这些漫长的冬日赋予我一种庄严感，在卡拉韦家庭宅院长大的经历让我有点自鸣得意，而在我们的城市，家宅依旧世世代代传称为某姓公馆。我现在才明白这个故事归根结底是一个西部的故事——汤姆、盖茨比、黛西、乔丹和我，我们都是西部来的，或许我们有着共同的缺点，这种缺点冥冥之中注定我们适应不了东部的生活。","That’s my middle west—not the wheat or the prairies or the lost Swede towns but the thrilling, returning trains of my youth and the street lamps and sleigh bells in the frosty dark and the shadows of holly wreaths thrown by lighted windows on the snow.I am part of that, a little solemn with the feel of those long winters, a little complacent from growing up in the Carraway house in a city where dwellings are still called through decades by a family’s name.I see now that this has been a story of the West, after all—Tom and Gatsby, Daisy and Jordan and I, were all Westerners, and perhaps we possessed some deficiency in common which made us subtly unadaptable to Eastern life."
"尽管东部让我兴奋无比，尽管我深刻意识到，比起俄亥俄河那边的那些单调、杂乱且臃肿的城镇，比起那些只有老人和小孩才能幸免于没完没了的闲言碎语的城镇，东部有着极大的优越性——即便这样，我都一直觉得它有点畸形。尤其是西卵，依然会出现在我的那些怪诞的梦里。在我看来，它就像埃尔·格雷科的一幅夜景画：月亮高悬在阴沉的天空中，月光昏暗，其下蹲伏着上百所集传统与怪诞于一身的房屋。前景里有四位身着礼服、神情严肃的男人抬着一副担架沿着人行道走着，担架上躺着一个喝得醉醺醺的女人，她的身上穿着件白色的晚礼服。她的一只手耷拉在一边，上面的珠宝首饰闪烁着寒光。那几个男的神色凝重地转身走进一所房子——却走错了地方。但是没有哪个人知道这个女人的名字，也没有人关心这些。","Even when the East excited me most, even when I was most keenly aware of its superiority to the bored, sprawling, swollen towns beyond the Ohio, with their interminable inquisitions which spared only the children and the very old—even then it had always for me a quality of distortion.West Egg especially still figures in my more fantastic dreams.I see it as a night scene by El Greco: a hundred houses, at once conventional and grotesque, crouching under a sullen, overhanging sky and a lustreless moon.In the foreground four solemn men in dress suits are walking along the sidewalk with a stretcher on which lies a drunken woman in a white evening dress.Her hand, which dangles over the side, sparkles cold with jewels.Gravely the men turn in at a house—the wrong house.But no one knows the woman’s name, and no one cares."
"盖茨比死后，东部就是以这种形象萦绕于我的心头，其畸形的程度是我的眼力所无法矫正的。因此当空中焚烧枯叶的蓝烟袅袅升起时，当晾衣绳上的湿衣服在寒风中变得僵硬时，我决定要回家去了。","After Gatsby’s death the East was haunted for me like that, distorted beyond my eyes’ power of correction.So when the blue smoke of brittle leaves was in the air and the wind blew the wet laundry stiff on the line I decided to come back home."
"在我离开之前还要做一件事，一件尴尬且令人不悦的事，而这件事或许最好还是放在一边不去理它。但是我想把一切都安排妥当，而不是相信善施却又冷漠的大海来冲走我的垃圾。我见到了乔丹·贝克，我们彻底谈了一下我们之间发生的事情，以及后来我的情况。她非常安静地坐在一张大大的椅子上，听着我讲话。","There was one thing to be done before I left, an awkward, unpleasant thing that perhaps had better have been let alone.But I wanted to leave things in order and not just trust that obliging and indifferent sea to sweep my refuse away.I saw Jordan Baker and talked over and around what had happened to us together and what had happened afterward to me, and she lay perfectly still listening in a big chair."
"她穿着一件高尔夫球运动装，我还记得她当时看上去像一幅漂亮的插图，她那微翘着的下巴，她那像秋叶般的金黄色的头发，她那浅棕色的脸，还有膝上的那双同样颜色的无指手套。我说完话后，她告诉我说自己和另外一个男的订婚了，别的一句没说。我对此非常怀疑，虽然她有好几个追求者 ，只要一点头就可以结婚，但我还是装出一副惊诧的样子。那会儿我有点怀疑自己是否犯了一个错误，然后我快速考虑了一下，便起身告辞了。","She was dressed to play golf and I remember thinking she looked like a good illustration, her chin raised a little, jauntily, her hair the color of an autumn leaf, her face the same brown tint as the fingerless glove on her knee.When I had finished she told me without comment that she was engaged to another man.I doubted that though there were several she could have married at a nod of her head but I pretended to be surprised.For just a minute I wondered if I wasn’t making a mistake, then I thought it all over again quickly and got up to say goodbye."
"“不管怎样说，是你把我甩掉了。”乔丹突然说，“你在电话里就把我甩了。我现在对你一点也不在乎了，但是这种经历对于我来说还挺新鲜的，而且我那会儿还感到有点晕乎乎的。”","‘Nevertheless you did throw me over,’ said Jordan suddenly.‘You threw me over on the telephone.I don’t give a damn about you now but it was a new experience for me and I felt a little dizzy for a while.’"
"我们握了握手。","We shook hands."
"“哦，你还记得不，”她接着说道，“我们有一次谈论过开车？”“什么……记不大清楚了。”","‘Oh, and do you remember—’ she added, ‘—a conversation we had once about driving a car?’‘Why—not exactly.’"
"“你说一个蹩脚司机一旦遇到了另外一个蹩脚司机就将不再安全了，是吧？瞧，我碰到另一个蹩脚司机了，对不对？我是说自己真是太粗心了，竟然做出了这么错误的猜测。我以为你是个相当老实、直率的人。我以为那是你暗暗引以为荣的品质。”","‘You said a bad driver was only safe until she met an—other bad driver?Well, I met another bad driver, didn’t I?I mean it was careless of me to make such a wrong guess.I thought you were rather an honest, straightforward person.I thought it was your secret pride.’"
"“我三十岁了，”我说，“要是再年轻五岁的话，或许我还可以欺骗自己，并引以为荣。”","‘I’m thirty,’ I said.‘I’m five years too old to lie to myself and call it honor.’"
"她没有说话。我对她又生气，又有点爱恋，同时心里还充满了无比的遗憾，转身离开了。","She didn’t answer.Angry, and half in love with her, and tremendously sorry, I turned away."
"十月下旬的一个下午，我见到了汤姆·布坎南。他沿着第五大道走在我的前面，还是那副机警又不可一世的样子，他的手微微离开身体，似乎要将一切阻碍扫平，他的头忽地转来转去，眼睛同时在四处张望着。我放慢了脚步，以免超过他。这时他停了下来，皱着眉头透过珠宝店的橱窗往里看着。突然他看到了我，于是便转身走回来，同时伸出了手：","One afternoon late in October I saw Tom Buchanan.He was walking ahead of me along Fifth Avenue in his alert, aggressive way, his hands out a little from his body as if to fight off interference, his head moving sharply here and there, adapting itself to his restless eyes.Just as I slowed up to avoid overtaking him he stopped and began frowning into the windows of a jewelry store.Suddenly he saw me and walked back holding out his hand."
"“怎么了，尼克？你不想和我握手吗？”","‘What’s the matter, Nick?Do you object to shaking hands with me?’"
"“不想。你也知道我对你的看法。”","‘Yes.You know what I think of you.’"
"“你疯了，尼克。”他赶忙说道，“疯得厉害呢，我不明白你到底怎么了。”","‘You’re crazy, Nick,’ he said quickly.‘Crazy as hell.I don’t know what’s the matter with you.’"
"“汤姆，”我质问道，“你那天下午跟威尔森说什么了？”","‘Tom,’ I inquired, ‘what did you say to Wilson that afternoon?’"
"他瞪着我，一句话也不说，于是我明白了自己当初对威尔森失踪的那几个小时的猜测是正确的。我掉头就走，但是他却上前一步，抓住了我的胳膊。","He stared at me without a word and I knew I had guessed right about those missing hours.I started to turn away but he took a step after me and grabbed my arm."
"“我对他讲了真相。”他说，“我们正准备离开的时候，他来到我家门口，我让人传话说我们不在家，他便强行闯到了楼上。他那时已经疯了，要是我不告诉他那车是谁的，他肯定会杀了我的。他的手一刻也没离开过口袋里的那把左轮手枪，而他那时就在我的家里……”他突然挑衅地停住了，“我告诉了他，那又怎么样呢？那家伙是自找的。就像当初蒙蔽黛西一样，他把你也给蒙蔽了，可他确实是心狠手辣。他撞死默特尔就跟撞死一条狗一样，车子停都没停一下。”","‘I told him the truth,’ he said.‘He came to the door while we were getting ready to leave and when I sent down word that we weren’t in he tried to force his way upstairs.He was crazy enough to kill me if I hadn’t told him who owned the car.His hand was on a revolver in his pocket every minute, he was in the house—’ He broke off defiantly.‘What if I did tell him?That fellow had it coming to him.He threw dust into your eyes just like he did in Daisy’s but he was a tough one.He ran over Myrtle like you’d run over a dog and never even stopped his car.’"
"我无言以对，只有那个无法言表的事实：那并不是事情的真相。","There was nothing I could say, except the one unutterable fact that it wasn’t true."
"“你觉得我就不难受吗——告诉你，我去退掉那套房子的时候，看到餐具柜上放着那盒该死的狗食饼干，坐下来，像个孩子一样嚎啕大哭。天哪，真是难受极了……”","‘And if you think I didn’t have my share of suffering—look here, when I went to give up that flat and saw that damn box of dog biscuits sitting there on the sideboard I sat down and cried like a baby.By God it was awful—’"
"我不能原谅他，也不会喜欢他，但是我明白，他所做的一切在他自己看来都是完全合乎情理的。这一切都冷漠、混乱不堪。汤姆和黛西，他们都是冷漠的人——他们砸碎了东西，毁了别人，然后退缩到自己的金钱当中，退缩到他们的麻木不仁中，退缩到那些将他们联系在一起的种种一切中，却让别人来帮他们收拾烂摊子……","I couldn’t forgive him or like him but I saw that what he had done was, to him, entirely justified.It was all very careless and confused.They were careless people, Tom and Daisy—they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made...."
"我同他握了握手，不握手未免有点愚蠢，因为我突然觉得自己好像在和一个孩子谈话。随后他走进珠宝店，买了一条珍珠项链——或许只是一副袖扣——永远摆脱了我这个乡巴佬狭隘的责怪。","I shook hands with him; it seemed silly not to, for I felt suddenly as though I were talking to a child.Then he went into the jewelry store to buy a pearl necklace—or perhaps only a pair of cuff buttons—rid of my provincial squea-mishness forever."
"我离开的时候，盖茨比的房子依旧是空的——他草坪上的草已经长得和我这边的一样高了。村里有个出租车司机，每次载客经过大门口总要停在那儿一会儿，对里面还指指点点的。也许出车祸的那天晚上，正是他载着盖茨比和黛西回东卵，而且他也可能自己为之编了一个故事。我不想听他的故事，于是我下火车后总是躲着他。","Gatsby’s house was still empty when I left—the grass on his lawn had grown as long as mine.One of the taxi drivers in the village never took a fare past the entrance gate without stopping for a minute and pointing inside; perhaps it was he who drove Daisy and Gatsby over to East Egg the night of the accident and perhaps he had made a story about it all his own.I didn’t want to hear it and I avoided him when I got off the train."
"每逢周六，我都会去纽约过夜，因为盖茨比那些灯火辉煌、令人眼花缭乱的晚会，至今依旧历历在目。我依旧能听到他的花园里传来的模模糊糊、连续不断的音乐声和欢笑声，还有他的车道上那一辆辆汽车来来回回的声音。有一天晚上，我确实听到真的有一辆汽车开到那儿了，还看到车灯照在了他家门口的台阶上。但我并没有上前探个究竟。也许那是最后的某位客人，他刚从天涯海角处归来，因此并不知道宴会已经永远结束了。","I spent my Saturday nights in New York because those gleaming, dazzling parties of his were with me so vividly that I could still hear the music and the laughter faint and incessant from his garden and the cars going up and down his drive.One night I did hear a material car there and saw its lights stop at his front steps.But I didn’t investigate.Probably it was some final guest who had been away at the ends of the earth and didn’t know that the party was over."
"最后那天晚上，我的行李已经打包好，车也卖给了杂货店的老板。我再次来到这幢宏大而杂乱的房子前，最后看一眼那象征了失败的一切。在白色的台阶上，不知是哪个小孩用块砖写了个下流的字，在月光中显得分外醒目，于是我踩在石头上，沙沙地来回磨，把它给擦掉了。随后我漫步来到海边，伸开四肢仰面躺在了沙滩上。","On the last night, with my trunk packed and my car sold to the grocer, I went over and looked at that huge incoherent failure of a house once more.On the white steps an obscene word, scrawled by some boy with a piece of brick, stood out clearly in the moonlight and I erased it, drawing my shoe raspingly along the stone.Then I wandered down to the beach and sprawled out on the sand."
"大多数的海滨别墅现在都已关门，四周几乎没有什么灯光，只能隐约看到海湾对岸的一艘渡船泛着微弱的光在移动。月亮升得越来越高了，那些无关紧要的别墅开始隐退于月光中，直到我渐渐意识到这里就是曾经在荷兰水手的眼中异彩绽放的古老小岛——新世界的一个清新、碧绿的胸膛。那些不复存在的树木，那些曾经为了建造盖茨比的别墅而被砍伐的树木，它们曾经在此迎风飘扬，轻声应和着人类那个最后的、最伟大的梦想，在那醉人的短暂瞬间，人类面对着这块土地时一定是屏声息气，情不自禁地进入到一种他既不理解也不渴求的美学沉思之中，在历史上最后一次与那合乎他想象力的奇迹面对面接触。","Most of the big shore places were closed now and there were hardly any lights except the shadowy, moving glow of a ferryboat across the Sound.And as the moon rose higher the inessential houses began to melt away until gradually I became aware of the old island here that flowered once for Dutch sailors’ eyes—a fresh, green breast of the new world.Its vanished trees, the trees that had made way for Gats-by’s house, had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all human dreams; for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his breath in the presence of this continent, compelled into an aesthetic contemplation he neither understood nor desired, face to face for the last time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder."
"当我坐在那里惆怅地缅怀那个古老而又不为人知的世界之时，我想象着盖茨比在黛西家码头上第一次看到那盏绿灯时那满心的惊奇。他走过漫漫长路来到这块蓝色的草坪，而他的梦想一定显得近在咫尺，几乎是唾手可得的。他不知道那个梦想其实已落于他的身后，被抛到城市之外无限的混沌之中，在那里共和国黑黝黝的原野在夜色中伸展而去。","And as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown world, I thought of Gatsby’s wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of Daisy’s dock.He had come a long way to this blue lawn and his dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it.He did not know that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that vast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under the night."
"盖茨比相信那盏绿灯，相信那个年复一年离我们越来越远却振奋人心的未来。那时它已经弃我们而去，但是那也没关系——明天我们会跑得更快，将胳膊伸得更远……总会有那么一个晴朗的上午——","Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us.It eluded us then, but that’s no matter—tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther....And one fine morning—"
"于是，我们努力向前，像逆流而上的小舟，不断被推回到过去。","So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."
"结束","THE END"
