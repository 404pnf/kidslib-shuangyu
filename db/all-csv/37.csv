"第一章　一个暴发户","CHAPTER I—A BEGGAR ON HORSEBACK"
"1751年8月25日，约摸下午两点钟，我——戴维???·鲍尔弗，走出了不列颠利嫩公司，一个杂役提着一袋钱跟着我，一些店老板在他们的店门口向我鞠躬致意。两天前，甚至近在昨天早晨，我都还像路边的叫花子一样：衣衫褴褛，落魄得只剩最后几个先令；我的同伴被宣判为叛国者；我自己也因涉罪而在全国被悬赏缉拿。今天我却被当成有社会地位的继承人、一位拥有土地的领主而受到礼遇，身边有一个银行杂役帮着我搬金币，口袋里还揣着几封推荐信，（通俗的说法）就是球正好在我的脚下了。","The 25th day of August, 1751, about two in the afternoon, I, David Balfour, came forth of the British Linen Company, a porter attending me with a bag of money, and some of the chief of these merchants bowing me from their doors.Two days before, and even so late as yestermorning, I was like a beggar-man by the wayside, clad in rags, brought down to my last shillings, my companion a condemned traitor, a price set on my own head for a crime with the news of which the country rang.To-day I was served heir to my position in life, a landed laird, a bank porter by me carrying my gold, recommendations in my pocket, and (in the words of the saying) the ball directly at my foot."
"有两件事使我在如此春风得意之时仍能保持镇定。第一就是我仍有一件非常棘手而极度危险的事情要处理；第二就是我所处的这个地方。这座高大、阴暗的城市对我来说是一个陌生的世界，这里人口众多、人员流动频繁而且喧闹嘈杂。以前我常去的地方都是一些荒坡野地、海边沙滩和寂静的乡村。那些熙熙攘攘的市民尤其让我感到不安。兰基勒的儿子身材矮小，他的衣服我几乎都穿不了。显然我还不够格在一个银行杂役面前摆架子。很明显，如果我穿了他的衣服，只会惹人嘲笑，（对我而言更为糟糕的是）会惹得他们打探询问。因此，我有必要去买几件自己的衣服，而且暂时还得和那个杂役并肩行走，把手搭在他的手臂上，就好像我们是一对朋友似的。","There were two circumstances that served me as ballast to so much sail.The first was the very difficult and deadly business I had still to handle; the second, the place that I was in.The tall, black city, and the numbers and movement and noise of so many folk, made a new world for me, after the moorland braes, the sea-sands and the still country-sides that I had frequented up to then.The throng of the citizens in particular abashed me.Rankeillor’s son was short and small in the girth; his clothes scarce held on me; and it was plain I was ill qualified to strut in the front of a bank-porter.It was plain, if I did so, I should but set folk laughing, and (what was worse in my case) set them asking questions.So that I behooved to come by some clothes of my own, and in the meanwhile to walk by the porter’s side, and put my hand on his arm as though we were a pair of friends."
"在卢肯市场的一家店里，我把自己装扮一新：不太华丽，因为我不想显出一副暴发户的样子，而是想显得体面且值得信赖，那样仆人们就会尊敬我。接着我去了一家军械店，在那里弄了一把普通的剑，好和我的社会地位相称。有了武器，我感到安全多了，尽管（对一个丝毫不懂防卫的人来说）它有可能会是个额外的危险。那个杂役当然有些经验，他评论说我的衣服挑得不错。","At a merchant’s in the Luckenbooths I had myself fitted out: none too fine, for I had no idea to appear like a beggar on horseback; but comely and responsible, so that servants should respect me.Thence to an armourer’s, where I got a plain sword, to suit with my degree in life.I felt safer with the weapon, though (for one so ignorant of defence) it might be called an added danger.The porter, who was naturally a man of some experience, judged my accoutrement to be well chosen."
"“一点儿也不打眼，”他说，“这一身朴素又体面。说到这柄长剑，配你的身份绝对没的说。不过我要是你的话，我就会去找一个更好的地方花钱买剑。”随后他提议我到牛门后街的一位主妇那里买冬袜，那是他的一个表亲，她织的袜子“耐穿得很”。","“Naething kenspeckle,” (1) said he; “plain, dacent claes.As for the rapier, nae doubt it sits wi’ your degree; but an I had been you, I would has waired my siller better-gates than that.”And he proposed I should buy winter-hosen from a wife in the Cowgate-back, that was a cousin of his own, and made them “extraordinar endurable.”"
"但是我手头还有其他更紧急的事情要做。我置身于这个破旧、阴暗的城市之中，相对于整个世界来说，这座城市就像一个养兔场，不仅居民数量多，而且走廊和门洞错综复杂。事实上，这是一个任何陌生人都不可能找到朋友的地方，还会让朋友成为另一个陌生人。就算他碰巧找到了附近，由于人们密密麻麻地住在这些高大的楼房里，他也极有可能得找上一天才碰对要找的门。通常的做法是雇一个他们称为杂工的伙计，就像是向导或者带路人，带领你去要去的地方，（在你的差事办完以后）再把你带回落脚地。但由于这些杂工总是被雇来提供同类服务，就有必要让他们了解这个城市的家家户户，于是他们逐渐形成了一种密探之间的兄弟情谊。我从坎贝尔先生讲的故事里了解到他们彼此如何交换信息，他们对雇主的事务所怀的好奇心有多强烈，以及他们如何充当警察的耳目。就我目前的情况而言，我要是真去雇佣这么一个尾随我的探子，恐怕不太明智。我要去拜访三个很紧要的人：我的同宗皮尔里格的鲍尔弗先生，阿平的代理人斯图尔特大律师，还有苏格兰的检察总长大人——普雷斯顿格兰奇的威廉·格兰特先生。拜访鲍尔弗先生之事并不难办，况且（皮尔里格在乡下）凭着自己的双腿和一口苏格兰语，我就敢自己找路去那里。但是其余的情况就不一样了。阿平凶杀案正在风头上，此时拜访阿平的代理人不仅危险，也和其他要办的事情很不协调。我希望有足够的时间和检察总长格兰特大人在一起，这是最好的办法。但是一出阿平的代理人之门便直奔那里，好像对我自己的事情不太有利，而且还有可能给朋友艾伦带来灭顶之灾。此外，整件事在我看来就像是：既要和兔子一起奔跑又要和猎人一起狩猎，这简直让我无法想象。因此，我决定立刻去办其中与斯图尔特先生和整个詹姆斯二世党人有关的事情。为了达到这个目的，我只能靠身边的这个杂役来做向导。但是就在我刚要给他地址的时候，突然淅淅沥沥地下起了一场雨——其他倒没有什么不好，只是可惜了我的新衣服——我们只好在一条巷子或是胡同的屋檐下躲雨。","But I had other matters on my hand more pressing.Here I was in this old, black city, which was for all the world like a rabbit-warren, not only by the number of its indwellers, but the complication of its passages and holes.It was, indeed, a place where no stranger had a chance to find a friend, let be another stranger.Suppose him even to hit on the right close, people dwelt so thronged in these tall houses, he might very well seek a day before he chanced on the right door.The ordinary course was to hire a lad they called a caddie, who was like a guide or pilot, led you where you had occasion, and (your errands being done) brought you again where you were lodging.But these caddies, being always employed in the same sort of services, and having it for obligation to be well informed of every house and person in the city, had grown to form a brotherhood of spies; and I knew from tales of Mr. Campbell’s how they communicated one with another, what a rage of curiosity they conceived as to their employer’s business, and how they were like eyes and fingers to the police.It would be a piece of little wisdom, the way I was now placed, to take such a ferret to my tails.I had three visits to make, all immediately needful: to my kinsman Mr. Balfour of Pilrig, to Stewart the Writer that was Appin’s agent, and to William Grant Esquire of Prestongrange, Lord Advocate of Scotland.Mr. Balfour’s was a non-committal visit; and besides (Pilrig being in the country) I made bold to find the way to it myself, with the help of my two legs and a Scots tongue.But the rest were in a different case.Not only was the visit to Appin’s agent, in the midst of the cry about the Appin murder, dangerous in itself, but it was highly inconsistent with the other.I was like to have a bad enough time of it with my Lord Advocate Grant, the best of ways; but to go to him hot-foot from Appin’s agent, was little likely to mend my own affairs, and might prove the mere ruin of friend Alan’s.The whole thing, besides, gave me a look of running with the hare and hunting with the hounds that was little to my fancy.I determined, therefore, to be done at once with Mr. Stewart and the whole Jacobitical side of my business, and to profit for that purpose by the guidance of the porter at my side.But it chanced I had scarce given him the address, when there came a sprinkle of rain—nothing to hurt, only for my new clothes—and we took shelter under a pend at the head of a close or alley."
"因为没来过这地方，我又朝里面走近了一些。那条窄道突然急转直下。两边冒出一些巍峨的高楼，而且凸显出来，一层高过一层。头顶上只现出窄窄的一线天空。根据我从窗户所偷窥到的情形和那些出出进进的体面人物来看，我就知道这些房子里满满都是人。这个地方的整个景象就如故事一般引起了我的兴趣。","Being strange to what I saw, I stepped a little farther in.The narrow paved way descended swiftly.Prodigious tall houses sprang upon each side and bulged out, one storey beyond another, as they rose.At the top only a ribbon of sky showed in.By what I could spy in the windows, and by the respectable persons that passed out and in, I saw the houses to be very well occupied; and the whole appearance of the place interested me like a tale."
"我还在盯着看，这时从我的身后突然传来一阵急促的踏步声和金属的撞击声。我迅即转身，发现一队武装士兵，在他们中间有一个穿着厚大衣的高个男子。他躬身行走着，一副谦逊有礼甚至卑躬屈膝的样子：他行走时似乎在挥动着双手，他的脸英俊中透着阴险。我觉得他看见了我，只是我没有迎面相视。这队人从我身边经过，走向巷子里的一扇门，一个穿着精致制服的男仆打开了门，两个年轻士兵夹着囚犯进去了，其余的人则抱着明火枪守在门边。","I was still gazing, when there came a sudden brisk tramp of feet in time and clash of steel behind me.Turning quickly, I was aware of a party of armed soldiers, and, in their midst, a tall man in a great coat.He walked with a stoop that was like a piece of courtesy, genteel and insinuating: he waved his hands plausibly as he went, and his face was sly and handsome.I thought his eye took me in, but could not meet it.This procession went by to a door in the close, which a serving-man in a fine livery set open; and two of the soldier-lads carried the prisoner within, the rest lingering with their firelocks by the door."
"在城市的街道上，无论发生什么事情，都会有一些无所事事的人和孩子跟着看热闹。现在也是如此。但是大部分人很快散去，最后只剩下了三个人。有一位是姑娘，她的穿着像位淑女，而且她的头上戴着德拉蒙德风格的纱罩。但是她的同伴或者（我应该说）随从却是衣衫褴褛，就和我的高地之行途中所见的很多人一样。他们一起用盖尔语热烈地交谈着，由于艾伦的缘故，这种声音在我听来很悦耳。虽然雨又停了，我的杂役拉着我要离开，我却朝他们凑近了些，想听他们说什么。那位女士厉声斥责着，其余的人则一个劲地在道歉，在她面前显得畏畏缩缩的，因此我敢肯定她出身于大户人家。他们三个人一直在口袋里找寻着，由此说明他们一行人非常拮据，为钱所困。看到所有的高地人都一样谦恭顺从且毛皮袋中空空如也，我不禁轻轻地笑了。","There can nothing pass in the streets of a city without some following of idle folk and children.It was so now; but the more part melted away incontinent until but three were left.One was a girl; she was dressed like a lady, and had a screen of the Drummond colours on her head; but her comrades or (I should say) followers were ragged gillies, such as I had seen the matches of by the dozen in my Highland journey.They all spoke together earnestly in Gaelic, the sound of which was pleasant in my ears for the sake of Alan; and, though the rain was by again, and my porter plucked at me to be going, I even drew nearer where they were, to listen.The lady scolded sharply, the others making apologies and cringeing before her, so that I made sure she was come of a chief’s house.All the while the three of them sought in their pockets, and by what I could make out, they had the matter of half a farthing among the party; which made me smile a little to see all Highland folk alike for fine obeisances and empty sporrans."
"碰巧那位女孩突然转身，所以我第一次看到了她的脸庞。一位年轻女子的面容就这样印入了一个男人的脑海，并驻留在那个男人的脑海中，没有比这更神奇的事了。他根本说不出个所以然，只是好像这正是他想要的东西。她有着一双像星星一样美丽而明亮的眼睛。我认为很可能眼睛是原因之一，但是我记得最清楚的还是她转身时嘴唇微微张开的样子。可是，不论出于什么原因，我就像个傻瓜一样站在那里盯着她看。而她那边，因为并不知道会有人靠得这么近，所以她看了我好一会儿，也许是出于惊讶，而并非全然出于礼貌。","It chanced the girl turned suddenly about, so that I saw her face for the first time.There is no greater wonder than the way the face of a young woman fits in a man’s mind, and stays there, and he could never tell you why; it just seems it was the thing he wanted.She had wonderful bright eyes like stars, and I daresay the eyes had a part in it; but what I remember the most clearly was the way her lips were a trifle open as she turned.And, whatever was the cause, I stood there staring like a fool.On her side, as she had not known there was anyone so near, she looked at me a little longer, and perhaps with more surprise, than was entirely civil."
"我这个乡下人的头脑中突然想到她也许是对我的新衣服感到奇怪，这么一想，我的脸就红到了耳根。看见我脸红了，她可能得出了自己的结论，因为她带着侍从走向巷子的更深处，然后他们又开始争论起来，而我再也听不见了。","It went through my country head she might be wondering at my new clothes; with that, I blushed to my hair, and at the sight of my colouring it is to be supposed she drew her own conclusions, for she moved her gillies farther down the close, and they fell again to this dispute, where I could hear no more of it."
"在那以前我也时常仰慕少女，但几乎没有这么突然而强烈的感觉。按照我的本性，我是宁愿往后退也不会朝前走的，因为我很害怕受到女人的嘲笑。你们会认为我现在更有理由故伎重演，因为我在大街上遇到的这位年轻女士似乎在跟随一个囚犯，而且还带着两个衣衫破旧、样子粗蛮的高地人。可是现在情形有点儿不同，显然这位姑娘认为我一直在探听她的秘密。但我穿着新衣服，带着佩剑，而且我还新得到了一笔财富，她这样看我就让我无法忍受了。暴发户是不能忍受被人如此看低的，或者，至少不能被这么一位年轻女士给看低了。","I had often admired a lassie before then, if scarce so sudden and strong; and it was rather my disposition to withdraw than to come forward, for I was much in fear of mockery from the womenkind.You would have thought I had now all the more reason to pursue my common practice, since I had met this young lady in the city street, seemingly following a prisoner, and accompanied with two very ragged indecent-like Highlandmen.But there was here a different ingredient; it was plain the girl thought I had been prying in her secrets; and with my new clothes and sword, and at the top of my new fortunes, this was more than I could swallow.The beggar on horseback could not bear to be thrust down so low, or, at least of it, not by this young lady."
"于是我跟着她，尽可能优雅地脱下我的新帽子向她致意。","I followed, accordingly, and took off my new hat to her the best that I was able."
"“女士，”我说，“我觉得只有让您知道我丝毫不懂盖尔语，这样对我本人才公平。确实，我是在听，因为我有朋友在高地线另一边，所以那种语言听起来很亲切。可是至于说你们的私事，如果你们说的是希腊语，我也许猜到的还多一些。”","“Madam,” said I, “I think it only fair to myself to let you understand I have no Gaelic.It is true I was listening, for I have friends of my own across the Highland line, and the sound of that tongue comes friendly; but for your private affairs, if you had spoken Greek, I might have had more guess at them.”"
"她冷淡地向我微微行了一个屈膝礼。“无妨，”她说，带着悦耳的口音，极像英格兰口音（但更加优美），“猫还可以看国王呢。”","She made me a little, distant curtsey.“There is no harm done,” said she, with a pretty accent, most like the English (but more agreeable).“A cat may look at a king.”"
"“我没有冒犯您的意思。”我说，“我不懂城里的礼节，在此之前，我还从来没有踏进过爱丁堡的城门。就把我当成一个乡下人吧——我就是这么个人，与其让您发现这一点，还不如我自己告诉您。”","“I do not mean to offend,” said I.“I have no skill of city manners; I never before this day set foot inside the doors of Edinburgh.Take me for a country lad—it’s what I am; and I would rather I told you than you found it out.”"
"“的确，陌生人在路上互相交谈是一件很不寻常的事，”她回答说，“不过如果你是在乡下长大的，那又另当别论了。我跟你一样来自乡下。正如你所看到的，我是高地人，我觉得自己比你离家乡更远。”","“Indeed, it will be a very unusual thing for strangers to be speaking to each other on the causeway,” she replied.“But if you are landward (2) bred it will be different.I am as landward as yourself; I am Highland, as you see, and think myself the farther from my home.”"
"“我穿过高地线还不到一个星期，”我说，“不到一个星期以前，我还在巴尔惠德的山坡上呢。”","“It is not yet a week since I passed the line,” said I.“Less than a week ago I was on the braes of Balwhidder.”"
"“巴尔惠德？”她叫道，“你居然来自巴尔惠德！这个地名让我太高兴了。你在那里没有呆很久吧，该不会认识我的朋友或家人吧？”","“Balwhither?” she cries.“Come ye from Balwhither!The name of it makes all there is of me rejoice.You will not have been long there, and not known some of our friends or family?”"
"“我曾和一个非常诚实、善良、名叫邓肯·杜·麦克拉伦的人一起住过。”我回答。","“I lived with a very honest, kind man called Duncan Dhu Maclaren,” I replied."
"“嘿，我认识邓肯，你说对他的名字了！”她说，“如果他是一个诚实的人，那他的妻子才真叫诚实呢。”","“Well, I know Duncan, and you give him the true name!” she said; “and if he is an honest man, his wife is honest indeed.”"
"“是啊，”我说，“他们都是好人，而且那个地方很美。”","“Ay,” said I, “they are fine people, and the place is a bonny place.”"
"“偌大的世界，哪里还会有这么好的地方呀！”她喊道，“我热爱那里的气息，以及生长在那里的一切。”","“Where in the great world is such another!” she cries; “I am loving the smell of that place and the roots that grow there.”"
"我完全被这少女的热情所感染了。“我真希望给您带来了一束石楠花。”我说，“虽然我刚开始和您说话时不太友善，但是现在看来我们有共同的朋友，我恳请您不要忘记我。人们都管我叫戴维·鲍尔弗。今天是我的幸运日，我刚继承了一处地产，而且才脱离生命危险没有多久。我希望您会为了巴尔惠德记住我的名字，”我说，“为了我的幸运日，我也会记住您的名字的。”","I was infinitely taken with the spirit of the maid.“I could be wishing I had brought you a spray of that heather,” says I.“And, though I did ill to speak with you at the first, now it seems we have common acquaintance, I make it my petition you will not forget me.David Balfour is the name I am known by.This is my lucky day, when I have just come into a landed estate, and am not very long out of a deadly peril.I wish you would keep my name in mind for the sake of Balwhidder,” said I, “and I will yours for the sake of my lucky day.”"
"“我的姓名说不得。”她回答道，满面骄傲之色，“一百多年来它从没有被人们说起过，哪怕是一刹那都没有。我是无名氏，就像精灵一样。卡特里奥娜·德拉蒙德是我现在用的名字。”","“My name is not spoken,” she replied, with a great deal of haughtiness.“More than a hundred years it has not gone upon men’s tongues, save for a blink.I am nameless, like the Folk of Peace.(3)Catriona Drummond is the one I use.”"
"此刻我真正明白我面对的是谁了。在整个辽阔的苏格兰，只有一个姓氏被禁止，那就是麦格雷戈家的姓氏。然而我不但没有逃避这不愉快的相识，反而陷得更深了。","Now indeed I knew where I was standing.In all broad Scotland there was but the one name proscribed, and that was the name of the Macgregors.Yet so far from fleeing this undesirable acquaintancy, I plunged the deeper in."
"“我和一位与您处境相同的人相处过，”我说，“而且我认为你们会成为朋友的。人们叫他罗宾·奥伊格。”","“I have been sitting with one who was in the same case with yourself,” said I, “and I think he will be one of your friends.They called him Robin Oig.”"
"“真的？”她叫道，“你遇到过罗布？”","“Did ye so?” cries she.“Ye met Rob?”"
"“我曾跟他一起度过一个夜晚。”我说。","“I passed the night with him,” said I."
"“他是夜间的一只鸟。”她说。","“He is a fowl of the night,” said she."
"“他那里有一套风笛，”我继续说道，“您可以据此看出他是怎么打发时间的。”","“There was a set of pipes there,” I went on, “so you may judge if the time passed.”"
"“无论如何，你应该不会是敌人。”她说，“刚才那个人就是他哥哥，被红衣士兵包围的那个人。此人正是家父。”","“You should be no enemy, at all events,” said she.“That was his brother there a moment since, with the red soldiers round him.It is him that I call father.”"
"“是这样吗？”我叫道，“您是詹姆斯·莫尔的一个女儿吗？”","“Is it so?” cried I.“Are you a daughter of James More’s?”"
"“是他唯一的女儿，”她说，“是一个囚犯的女儿。我应该忘记这一点的，哪怕只忘记一个小时，好和陌生人一起谈谈话！”","“All the daughter that he has,” says she: “the daughter of a prisoner; that I should forget it so, even for one hour, to talk with strangers!”"
"这时她的一个侍从用所会的英语向她报告，想知道“她”（意思是他自己）该拿“鼻烟”怎么办。我稍一打量，发现他个子矮小、罗圈腿、红头发、大脑袋，我可在这种人身上吃过不少亏。","Here one of the gillies addressed her in what he had of English, to know what “she” (meaning by that himself) was to do about “ta sneeshin.”I took some note of him for a short, bandy-legged, red-haired, big-headed man, that I was to know more of to my cost."
"“今天不可能有了，尼尔，”她回答，“没有钱，你怎么可能弄到‘鼻烟’呢！这又一次教训你以后要更加小心。我想詹姆斯·莫尔也会对汤姆家的尼尔不大满意了。”","“There can be none the day, Neil,” she replied.“How will you get ‘sneeshin,’ wanting siller!It will teach you another time to be more careful; and I think James More will not be very well pleased with Neil of the Tom.”"
"“德拉蒙德小姐，”我说，“我跟您说过今天是我的幸运日。我在这里，还有个银行杂役跟着我。要记住我曾在您的家乡巴尔惠德受到过热情款待。”","“Miss Drummond,” I said, “I told you I was in my lucky day.Here I am, and a bank-porter at my tail.And remember I have had the hospitality of your own country of Balwhidder.”"
"“那不是我的家人所给予的。”她说。","“It was not one of my people gave it,” said she."
"“啊，好，”我说，“但是至少我欠你叔叔几首风笛曲的情。此外，我已经把自己看作是您的朋友了，而您很健忘，并没有适时拒绝我。”","“Ah, well,” said I, “but I am owing your uncle at least for some springs upon the pipes.Besides which, I have offered myself to be your friend, and you have been so forgetful that you did not refuse me in the proper time.”"
"“如果是需要一大笔钱，也许要请你帮忙，”她说，“不过我要告诉你这是怎么回事。詹姆斯·莫尔戴着镣铐被关在监狱里，但是这段时间，他们每天都会带他来这里，到检察总长家……”","“If it had been a great sum, it might have done you honour,” said she; “but I will tell you what this is.James More lies shackled in prison; but this time past they will be bringing him down here daily to the Advocate’s...”"
"“检察总长家！”我喊道，“那就是……？”","“The Advocate’s!”I cried.“Is that...?”"
"“这就是普雷斯顿格兰奇的格兰特检查总长大人的府邸。”她说，“他们不时地带我父亲来审问，我还不太清楚目的何在，但是好像还是给他留了一些希望。一直以来他们都不准我见他，也不准他写信。我们就在国王大街上等着想碰到他，有时我们在他经过时给他送点儿鼻烟，有时会送别的东西。但现在这个惹乱子的小子——尼尔，邓肯的儿子，把我用来买鼻烟的四个便士给弄丢了。这样詹姆斯·莫尔肯定没鼻烟了，他会以为他女儿把他给忘记了。”","“It is the house of the Lord Advocate Grant of Prestongrange,” said she.“There they bring my father one time and another, for what purpose I have no thought in my mind; but it seems there is some hope dawned for him.All this same time they will not let me be seeing him, nor yet him write; and we wait upon the King’s street to catch him; and now we give him his snuff as he goes by, and now something else.And here is this son of trouble, Neil, son of Duncan, has lost my four-penny piece that was to buy that snuff, and James More must go wanting, and will think his daughter has forgotten him.”"
"我从口袋里掏出六个便士，递给尼尔，吩咐他去办自己的差事。然后对她说：“那六个便士是伴随我从巴尔惠德过来的。”","I took sixpence from my pocket, gave it to Neil, and bade him go about his errand.Then to her, “That sixpence came with me by Balwhidder,” said I."
"“啊！”她说，“你不愧是格里格拉人的朋友！”","“Ah!” she said, “you are a friend to the Gregara!”"
"“我也不想骗您，”我说，“我对格里格拉知之甚少，而对詹姆斯·莫尔和他的所作所为更不了解。但是自打我站在这个巷子里以后，我似乎对您有些了解了，如果您说我是‘卡特里奥娜小姐的朋友’，我觉得您倒是没有被欺骗。”","“I would not like to deceive you, either,” said I.“I know very little of the Gregara and less of James More and his doings, but since the while I have been standing in this close, I seem to know something of yourself; and if you will just say ‘a friend to Miss Catriona’ I will see you are the less cheated.”"
"“人是不可能没有朋友的。”她说。","“The one cannot be without the other,” said she."
"“我会尽力而为。”我说。","“I will even try,” said I."
"“那你又会怎么看待我呀！”她喊道，“竟然和初次见面的陌生人拉手！”","“And what will you be thinking of myself!” she cried, “to be holding my hand to the first stranger!”"
"“我只是在想您是一个好女儿。”我说。","“I am thinking nothing but that you are a good daughter,” said I."
"“我绝不可能不还这笔钱的，”她说，“你会在哪里落脚？”","“I must not be without repaying it,” she said; “where is it you stop!”"
"“说实话，我尚无落脚之处，”我说，“我到这个城市还不到三个小时。不过要是您告诉我您住的方向，我就会大胆地为自己去找回那六个便士。”","“To tell the truth, I am stopping nowhere yet,” said I, “being not full three hours in the city; but if you will give me your direction, I will he no bold as come seeking my sixpence for myself.”"
"“我能相信你那句话吗？”她问道。","“Will I can trust you for that?” she asked."
"“您不必担心。”我说。","“You need have little fear,” said I."
"“詹姆斯·莫尔也无法忍受借钱不还的，”她说，“我暂时在迪恩村外落脚，在河水的北边，和阿勒代斯的德拉蒙德·奥格尔维夫人一起，她是我很亲近的朋友，她会很高兴能感谢您。”","“James More could not bear it else,” said she.“I stop beyond the village of Dean, on the north side of the water, with Mrs. Drummond-Ogilvy of Allardyce, who is my near friend and will be glad to thank you.”"
"“到时您会见到我的，就像我保证的，我会尽快去。”我说。接着，对于艾伦的记忆再次涌向我的脑海，我便匆忙告别了。","“You are to see me, then, so soon as what I have to do permits,” said I; and, the remembrance of Alan rolling in again upon my mind, I made haste to say farewell."
"我不禁想到，就像我刚才那样，短暂的相识我们就感到特别无拘无束，转而又想到一位真正明智的年轻女士本应该表现得更加腼腆才是。我觉得是那位银行杂役把我从这一连串失礼的思绪中唤醒了。","I could not but think, even as I did so, that we had made extraordinary free upon short acquaintance, and that a really wise young lady would have shown herself more backward.I think it was the bank-porter that put me from this ungallant train of thought."
"“我本来以为你是个有点儿理智的小伙子，”他开始说起来，并努了努嘴，“一到了这大门口，你怎么就走不动了。一见美女，钱财分离。呃，你可真是个不懂事的毛头小子！”他喊道，“不过一个不检点的娘们而已！就哄得你晕头转向！”","“I thoucht ye had been a lad of some kind o’ sense,” he began, shooting out his lips.“Ye’re no likely to gang far this gate.A fule and his siller’s shune parted.Eh, but ye’re a green callant!” he cried, “an’ a veecious, tae!Cleikin’ up wi’ baubeejoes!”"
"“要是你敢再说那位年轻女士……”我开始回嘴。","“If you dare to speak of the young lady…”I began."
"“女士！”他叫道，“掌控我们、保护我们，是什么女士？那是位女士吗？这城里就尽是女士了。女士们啊！嘿，看得出你根本就不太懂得女人的心！”","“Leddy!” he cried.“Haud us and safe us, whatten leddy?Ca’ thon a leddy?The toun’s fu’ o’ them.Leddies!Man, its weel seen ye’re no very acquant in Embro!”"
"一阵怒火涌上我心头。","A clap of anger took me."
"“好了，”我说，“带我去我跟你说的地方，闭上你的臭嘴！”","“Here,” said I, “lead me where I told you, and keep your foul mouth shut!”"
"虽然他不再直接对着我说，但是他也并没完全听我的，他边走边对着我放肆高歌，歌词含沙射影，而且声音特别难听刺耳——","He did not wholly obey me, for, though he no more addressed me directly, he very impudent sang at me as he went in a manner of innuendo, and with an exceedingly ill voice and ear—"
"“玛丽·李沿街往下走，她的斗篷突然不见了，她低头往下瞅一瞅，看见她的睡衣露在外头。我们走到东又走到西，神魂颠倒，转向又晕头；我们走到东又走到西，对着玛丽·李殷勤追求。”","“As Mally Lee cam doun the street, her capuchin did flee,She cuist a look ahint her to see her negligee.And we’re a’ gaun east and wast, we’re a’ gann ajee,We’re a’ gaun east and wast courtin’ Mally Lee.”"

"第二章　高地律师","CHAPTER II—THE HIGHLAND WRITER"
"查尔斯·斯图尔特律师住在一座阶梯的顶端，那阶梯是泥瓦匠所建过最长的，绝对有十五级之多。我到他家门前时，一位办事员已经把门打开，并告诉我他的主人就在里面。我几乎还来不及喘口气打发我那个杂役走。","Mr. Charles Stewart the Writer dwelt at the top of the longest stair ever mason set a hand to; fifteen flights of it, no less; and when I had come to his door, and a clerk had opened it, and told me his master was within, I had scarce breath enough to send my porter packing."
"“去你的走到东来又走到西！”我说着，从他手中拿过钱袋，便跟着办事员走了进去。","“Awa’ east and west wi’ ye!” said I, took the money bag out of his hands, and followed the clerk in."
"外间是办公室，办事员的椅子在桌子边，桌上摊放着很多法律文件。内室的门是开着的，一个精神饱满的小个子男人坐在那里专心看着一份契约，我进去时，他连眼睛都没有抬一下。实际上，他的手指还在原处，好像准备让我出去好接着再继续他的研究。这让我很不高兴，而让我更不高兴的是，我觉得那位办事员已经摆出一副要偷听我们之间谈话的架势了。","The outer room was an office with the clerk’s chair at a table spread with law papers.In the inner chamber, which opened from it, a little brisk man sat poring on a deed, from which he scarce raised his eyes on my entrance; indeed, he still kept his finger in the place, as though prepared to show me out and fall again to his studies.This pleased me little enough; and what pleased me less, I thought the clerk was in a good posture to overhear what should pass between us."
"我问他是不是查尔斯·斯图尔特律师。","I asked if he was Mr. Charles Stewart the Writer."
"“正是，”他说，“那么，如果为公平起见，请问你又是谁呢？”","“The same,” says he; “and, if the question is equally fair, who may you be yourself?”"
"“你还从未听说过我的名字或者我这个人，”我说，“但是我从一个你很熟悉的朋友那里给你带来了一件信物。你很熟悉的，”我重复道，同时压低声音说，“但是也许目前你并不很想得到他的消息。我要向你陈述的这些事情具有相当的机密性。总之，我认为我们得私下谈谈。”","“You never heard tell of my name nor of me either,” said I, “but I bring you a token from a friend that you know well.That you know well,” I repeated, lowering my voice, “but maybe are not just so keen to hear from at this present being.And the bits of business that I have to propone to you are rather in the nature of being confidential.In short, I would like to think we were quite private.”"
"他二话没说便站了起来，一脸很不高兴地扔下文件，打发办事员去办一个差事，然后反手关上了房门。","He rose without more words, casting down his paper like a man ill-pleased, sent forth his clerk of an errand, and shut to the house-door behind him."
"“现在，先生，”他一边往回走一边说，“大胆说出你的想法，什么都不用害怕。尽管在你开始说之前，”他喊道，“我要告诉你我自己心中很不安！我预先告诉你，你不是姓斯图尔特就是斯图尔特家派你来的。这是一个好姓氏，是个我们家族子孙都不会看轻的姓氏。但是我开始害怕听到这个姓氏了。”","“Now, sir,” said he, returning, “speak out your mind and fear nothing; though before you begin,” he cries out, “I tell you mine misgives me!I tell you beforehand, ye’re either a Stewart or a Stewart sent ye.A good name it is, and one it would ill-become my father’s son to lightly.But I begin to grue at the sound of it.”"
"“我名叫鲍尔弗，”我说，“肖斯的戴维·鲍尔弗。至于说派我来的人，我会让他的信物来说话。”接着我给他看了银纽扣。","“My name is called Balfour,” said I, “David Balfour of Shaws.As for him that sent me, I will let his token speak.”And I showed the silver button."
"“放到你口袋里去，先生！”他喊道，“你不需要说出名字。这该死的纽扣，我认得出他的这枚纽扣！真该死！他现在在哪里？”","“Put it in your pocket, sir!” cries he.“Ye need name no names.The deevil’s buckie, I ken the button of him!And de’il hae’t!Where is he now?"""
"我告诉他我不知道艾伦在哪里，但是他在靠近北边的某个安全的地方（或者他认为他在安全的地方），他会一直躲到帮他找到一艘船。至于怎样或者到哪里找他，则要经过他口头同意方可。","I told him I knew not where Alan was, but he had some sure place (or thought he had) about the north side, where he was to lie until a ship was found for him; and how and where he had appointed to be spoken with."
"“我一直都知道我会被我这个家所拖累而上绞架的，”他喊道，“唉，天哪！我相信这一天现在来了！给他弄一艘船，这是他说的！那谁来付这笔钱？这个家伙疯了！”","“It’s been always my opinion that I would hang in a tow for this family of mine,” he cried, “and, dod!I believe the day’s come now!Get a ship for him, quot’ he!And who’s to pay for it?The man’s daft!”"
"“付钱这件事由我负责，斯图尔特先生。”我说,“这里有一大袋金币，如果不够，我还可以送更多过来。”","“That is my part of the affair, Mr. Stewart,” said I.“Here is a bag of good money, and if more be wanted, more is to be had where it came from.”"
"“我不需要问一下你的政治立场？”他说。","“I needn’t ask your politics,” said he."
"“不需要，”我微笑着说，“因为我从小就是辉格党。”","“Ye need not,” said I, smiling, “for I’m as big a Whig as grows.”"
"“等一下，等一下，”斯图尔特先生说，“这一切是怎么回事？一个辉格党？那你为什么带着艾伦的纽扣来这里？我发现你在插手的又是一桩什么样的秘密交易，辉格党先生？他是一个遭褫夺的叛党，还被控杀人，被人悬赏二百英镑要他的命。可是你要我来管他这件事，然后却告诉我说你是一个辉格党！我以前从没想到过居然有这样的辉格党，尽管我见过很多辉格党人。”","“Stop a bit, stop a bit,” says Mr. Stewart.“What’s all this?A Whig?Then why are you here with Alan’s button? and what kind of a black-foot traffic is this that I find ye out in, Mr. Whig?Here is a forfeited rebel and an accused murderer, with two hundred pounds on his life, and ye ask me to meddle in his business, and then tell me ye’re a Whig!I have no mind of any such Whigs before, though I’ve kent plenty of them.”"
"“他是一个遭褫夺的叛党，可是更加遗憾的是，”我说道，“这个人是我的朋友。我只能希望他曾受过更好的引导。至于说他被控杀人，那是他倒霉，但他也是被冤枉的。”","“He’s a forfeited rebel, the more’s the pity,” said I, “for the man’s my friend.I can only wish he had been better guided.And an accused murderer, that he is too, for his misfortune; but wrongfully accused.”"
"“我听到你是这么说的。”斯图尔特说。","“I hear you say so,” said Stewart."
"“不久以后，就不只是你会听到我这么说了。”我说，“艾伦·布雷克是无辜的，詹姆斯也是无辜的。”","“More than you are to hear me say so, before long,” said I.“Alan Breck is innocent, and so is James.”"
"“哦！”他说，“这两个案子是连在一起的。如果艾伦没有涉案，詹姆斯就绝不会牵扯进去。”","“Oh!” says he, “the two cases hang together.If Alan is out, James can never be in.”"
"随即我简要介绍了我和艾伦的相识经过，告诉了他阿平凶杀案发生时我恰好在场，说起我们在石楠丛中的种种逃亡经历，以及我重新获得我的财产之事。“因此，先生，你现在已经了解这些事情的来龙去脉了，”我继续说，“而且你自己也看得出我是如何掺和进你的家族以及朋友的事情中的，这些事（看在我们大家的份上）我希望能够顺利一些、少点儿血腥。你自己也会明白：我这些事情是有某些特定背景的，随意选个律师来办是不合适的。没有更多要说的了，我只想问你是否会接下我要办的事情？”","Hereupon I told him briefly of my acquaintance with Alan, of the accident that brought me present at the Appin murder, and the various passages of our escape among the heather, and my recovery of my estate.“So, sir, you have now the whole train of these events,” I went on, “and can see for yourself how I come to be so much mingled up with the affairs of your family and friends, which (for all of our sakes) I wish had been plainer and less bloody.You can see for yourself, too, that I have certain pieces of business depending, which were scarcely fit to lay before a lawyer chosen at random.No more remains, but to ask if you will undertake my service?”"
"“我还没有好好琢磨此事。不过既然你带来了艾伦的纽扣，就没有给我留下什么选择的余地了，”他说，“你有什么要交代的？”他拿起笔又问。","“I have no great mind to it; but coming as you do with Alan’s button, the choice is scarcely left me,” said he.“What are your instructions?” he added, and took up his pen."
"“首先一点就是要偷渡艾伦出国，”我说，“不过我没必要再重复了。”","“The first point is to smuggle Alan forth of this country,” said I, “but I need not be repeating that.”"
"“我不可能忘记这一点的。”斯图尔特说。","“I am little likely to forget it,” said Stewart."
"“接下来一件事就是我还欠克卢尼一点儿钱，”我继续说，“对我来说要把钱转给他很麻烦，但对你来说却不成问题。就是两英镑五先令和三枚半便士的小银币。”","“The next thing is the bit money I am owing to Cluny,” I went on.“It would be ill for me to find a conveyance, but that should be no stick to you.It was two pounds five shillings and three-halfpence farthing sterling.”"
"他记了下来。","He noted it."
"“另外，”我说，“有一位亨德兰先生，是阿德格尔的一位持照牧师和传教士，我很想送些鼻烟到他手中。因为我猜想你和你在阿平的朋友（就在附近）一直有联系，毫无疑问，这件事情你可以和另外一件事一起办。”","“Then,” said I, “there’s a Mr. Henderland, a licensed preacher and missionary in Ardgour, that I would like well to get some snuff into the hands of; and, as I daresay you keep touch with your friends in Appin (so near by), it’s a job you could doubtless overtake with the other.”"
"“大约多少钱的鼻烟？”他问道。","“How much snuff are we to say?” he asked."
"“我想是两英镑吧。”我说。","“I was thinking of two pounds,” said I."
"“两英镑。”他说。","“Two,” said he."
"“然后还有艾莉森·黑斯蒂姑娘，她住在莱姆基恩斯，”我说，“她曾帮助我和艾伦横渡福斯河。我在想如果我可以送她一件漂亮的礼拜服，正合她身份，让她可以穿着体面，这样会让我的良心得到安慰。因为事实上，我们两条命都多亏了她。”","“Then there’s the lass Alison Hastie, in Lime Kilns,” said I.“Her that helped Alan and me across the Forth.I was thinking if I could get her a good Sunday gown, such as she could wear with decency in her degree, it would be an ease to my conscience; for the mere truth is, we owe her our two lives.”"
"“鲍尔弗先生，看到你这么节俭，我很高兴。”他一边记录一边说。","“I am glad to see you are thrifty, Mr. Balfour,” says he, making his notes."
"“要是我在得到财富的第一天就挥霍，那我会感到羞愧的，”我说，“但是现在，如果你可以算出所需的费用和你自己应得的报酬，我很想知道我是不是还可以拿回一些零用钱。不是我吝啬，不愿拿出全部金币来保证艾伦的安全，也不是我没有更多的钱。但是一天之内就已经提取了那么多钱，我认为要是我再回去要求提款，印象会很不好。只是一定要确保你的钱够用，”我补充说，“因为我实在不想再和你见面了。”","“I would think shame to be otherwise the first day of my fortune,” said I.“And now, if you will compute the outlay and your own proper charges, I would be glad to know if I could get some spending-money back.It’s not that I grudge the whole of it to get Alan safe; it’s not that I lack more; but having drawn so much the one day, I think it would have a very ill appearance if I was back again seeking, the next.Only be sure you have enough,” I added, “for I am very undesirous to meet with you again.”"
"“好吧，看到你这么小心谨慎，我也很高兴。”那律师说，“不过我认为你把这么大一笔钱交给我处理是在冒险。”","“Well, and I’m pleased to see you’re cautious, too,” said the Writer.“But I think ye take a risk to lay so considerable a sum at my discretion.”"
"他说话的时候带着一丝冷笑。","He said this with a plain sneer."
"“我不得不冒这个险，”我回答道，“噢，还有一件事要请教你，就是给我指点一下住处吧，因为我还无处栖身呢。不过必须得让人觉得我是碰巧住到那里的，因为如果检察总长大人对你我相识心存戒备的话，那就什么事也办不成了。”","“I’ll have to run the hazard,” I replied.“O, and there’s another service I would ask, and that’s to direct me to a lodging, for I have no roof to my head.But it must be a lodging I may seem to have hit upon by accident, for it would never do if the Lord Advocate were to get any jealousy of our acquaintance.”"
"“你大可以放心，”他说，“我永远都不会提起你的名字，先生。我相信就算检察总长不知道你的存在，也一样会很有同情心的。”","“Ye may set your weary spirit at rest,” said he.“I will never name your name, sir; and it’s my belief the Advocate is still so much to be sympathised with that he doesnae ken of your existence.”"
"我知道我让这个人产生误会了。","I saw I had got to the wrong side of the man."
"“那么，哪天去见见他应该很不错，”我说，“最迟到明天我拜访他的时候，他就会从闻所未闻而变成获悉此事了。”","“There’s a braw day coming for him, then,” said I, “for he’ll have to learn of it on the deaf side of his head no later than to-morrow, when I call on him.”"
"“当你拜访他的时候！”斯图尔特先生重复道，“是我愚蠢，还是你犯傻呀！你去接近检察总长干什么！”","“When ye call on him!” repeated Mr. Stewart.“Am I daft, or are you!What takes ye near the Advocate!”"
"“哦，只不过是去投案自首罢了。”我说。","“O, just to give myself up,” said I."
"“鲍尔弗先生，”他喊道，“你是在耍弄我吗？”","“Mr. Balfour,” he cried, “are ye making a mock of me?”"
"“不，先生，”我说，“尽管我觉得你已经允许自己对我这么随便了。但是我得让你彻底明白，我丝毫没有闹着玩的意思。”","“No, sir,” said I, “though I think you have allowed yourself some such freedom with myself.But I give you to understand once and for all that I am in no jesting spirit.”"
"“我也没有，”斯图尔特说，“而且我要让你明白（如果可以这么说的话）我越来越不喜欢你的举止表现了。你带着各种各样的要求到我这里来，这些要求会把我牵涉进一连串可疑的行为中，将来某一天也会让我成为那种很不受欢迎的人。然后你又告诉我，你一出我的办公室就会去和检察总长讲和！管他艾伦的纽扣在这里，还是艾伦的纽扣在那里，就是整个艾伦也不可能再收买我进一步插手此事了。”","“Nor yet me,” says Stewart.“And I give yon to understand (if that’s to be the word) that I like the looks of your behaviour less and less.You come here to me with all sorts of propositions, which will put me in a train of very doubtful acts and bring me among very undesirable persons this many a day to come.And then you tell me you’re going straight out of my office to make your peace with the Advocate!Alan’s button here or Alan’s button there, the four quarters of Alan wouldnae bribe me further in.”"
"“听你这么说我可有点儿生气了，”我说，“不过也许我们可以避免你所反对的情况。除了投案自首，我实在想不出别的办法，但是也许你能够想出另外的办法。要是你能想出来的话，我是绝对不会拒绝的，我只会感到如释重负。因为我觉得和这位检察总长大人打交道可能于我自身不太有利。只有一件事情是很清楚的，那就是我得举证，因为我希望这样能保全艾伦的人格（这是他仅有的东西了）和詹姆斯的性命，保全詹姆斯的性命更是迫在眉睫。”","“I would take it with a little more temper,” said I, “and perhaps we can avoid what you object to.I can see no way for it but to give myself up, but perhaps you can see another; and if you could, I could never deny but what I would be rather relieved.For I think my traffic with his lordship is little likely to agree with my health.There’s just the one thing clear, that I have to give my evidence; for I hope it’ll save Alan’s character (what’s left of it), and James’s neck, which is the more immediate.”"
"他沉默了一小会儿，然后开口了：“小伙子啊，永远也不会有人让你去举这样的证的。”","He was silent for a breathing-space, and then, “My man,” said he, “you’ll never be allowed to give such evidence.”"
"“我们将拭目以待，”我说，“只要我愿意，我就会很固执。”","“We’ll have to see about that,” said I; “I’m stiff-necked when I like.”"
"“你这个十足的傻瓜！”斯图尔特喊道，“他们想要的是詹姆斯。詹姆斯得被绞死——艾伦也一样，只要他们能抓到他——但是詹姆斯无论如何都会被绞死的！为这样的事情去接近检察总长，你就看吧！他一定会找办法封住你的嘴。”","“Ye muckle ass!” cried Stewart, “it’s James they want; James has got to hang—Alan, too, if they could catch him—but James whatever!Go near the Advocate with any such business, and you’ll see! he’ll find a way to muzzle, ye.”"
"“我相信那位检察总长不会那么坏。”我说。","“I think better of the Advocate than that,” said I."
"“让那个检察总长见鬼去吧！”他喊道，“关键是坎贝尔家的人，小伙子！你会招来他们整个家族的人群起而攻的，那位检察总长也一样。可怜的家伙！你居然看不出你处于什么样的境地，太奇怪了！如果你还没有办法管住自己的嘴，就会捅大娄子的。他们会把你推上被告席，你难道不明白？”他边喊边用一根手指戳着我的腿。","“The Advocate be dammed!” cries he.“It’s the Campbells, man!You’ll have the whole clanjamfry of them on your back; and so will the Advocate too, poor body!It’s extraordinar ye cannot see where ye stand!If there’s no fair way to stop your gab, there’s a foul one gaping.They can put ye in the dock, do ye no see that?” he cried, and stabbed me with one finger in the leg."
"“唉，”我说，“就在今天早晨另外一位律师对我说过同样的话。”","“Ay,” said I, “I was told that same no further back than this morning by another lawyer.”"
"“那么他是谁？”斯图尔特问，“至少他说得在理。”","“And who was he?” asked Stewart, “He spoke sense at least.”"
"我告诉他说，务请原谅我不能说出那个人的名字，因为他是一位正派坚定的老辉格党，而且不想卷入这类事情中。","I told I must be excused from naming him, for he was a decent stout old Whig, and had little mind to be mixed up in such affairs."
"“我觉得全世界好像都搅和进来了！”斯图尔特喊道，“但是你跟他说了什么？”","“I think all the world seems to be mixed up in it!” cries Stewart.“But what said you?”"
"“我告诉了他我和兰基勒在肖斯家的房屋前所交谈的内容。”","“I told him what had passed between Rankeillor and myself before the house of Shaws.”"
"“那行了，你一样会被绞死的！”他说，“你会在詹姆斯·斯图尔特身旁被绞死。你命该如此。”","“Well, and so ye will hang!” said he.“Ye’ll hang beside James Stewart.There’s your fortune told.”"
"“我希望结果不至于那么糟，”我说，“可是我绝不否认会有风险。”","“I hope better of it yet than that,” said I; “but I could never deny there was a risk.”"
"“风险！”他说，然后又一次坐在那里沉默了，“我应该谢谢你对我的朋友如此忠心，你对他们表现出了极大的勇气，”他说，“如果你有力量支持他们的话。但是我要警告你，你涉水很深。我是不会把自己放在你的位置上的（我天生就是斯图尔特族人！），因为自从诺亚以后所有的斯图尔特人就一直是这样了。风险？唉！我已经冒过太多的风险了。但是试图冒险站在法庭上、站在坎贝尔陪审团和坎贝尔法官的面前，试图在坎贝尔的家乡为坎贝尔的不和而冒险——站在我的角度想想看，鲍尔弗，这是我力所不能及的。”","“Risk!” says he, and then sat silent again.“I ought to thank you for you staunchness to my friends, to whom you show a very good spirit,” he says, “if you have the strength to stand by it.But I warn you that you’re wading deep.I wouldn’t put myself in your place (me that’s a Stewart born!) for all the Stewarts that ever there were since Noah.Risk? ay, I take over-many; but to be tried in court before a Campbell jury and a Campbell judge, and that in a Campbell country and upon a Campbell quarrel—think what you like of me, Balfour, it’s beyond me.”"
"“我猜，只是思维方式不同罢了，”我说，“之前我父亲就是这么教育我的。”","“It’s a different way of thinking, I suppose,” said I; “I was brought up to this one by my father before me.”"
"“我向他致敬！他已经为该姓氏留下了一个正派的儿子，”他说，“可我不需要你来过分严厉地评判我。我的处境注定会很艰难。你看，先生，你告诉我说你是一个辉格党人。我在想那我是什么。肯定不是辉格党人，我不可能是辉格党人。但是——让我悄悄告诉你，小伙子——也许我也不会很热衷于其对立面吧。”","“Glory to his bones! he has left a decent son to his name,” says he.“Yet I would not have you judge me over-sorely.My case is dooms hard.See, sir, ye tell me ye’re a Whig: I wonder what I am.No Whig to be sure; I couldnae be just that.But—laigh in your ear, man—I’m maybe no very keen on the other side.”"
"“真的是那样吗？”我叫道，“我认为像你这么睿智的人就该是这样的。”","“Is that a fact?” cried I.“It’s what I would think of a man of your intelligence.”"
"“得了！你别奉承我了！”他叫道，“我们双方都很明智。但是就我个人而言，我并不特别想伤害乔治国王。至于说詹姆斯国王，上帝保佑他！在我看来他在大海对岸做得很好。我是一名律师，你知道的：我就喜好读读书、喝点酒、做一场好辩护、签一份好契约、在议会上与其他律师一起高谈阔论，也许有机会的话还喜欢周六晚上打打高尔夫球。你是从哪里弄来高地人的披肩和砍刀的？”","“Hut! none of your whillywhas!”(1) cries he.“There’s intelligence upon both sides.But for my private part I have no particular desire to harm King George; and as for King James, God bless him! he does very well for me across the water.I’m a lawyer, ye see: fond of my books and my bottle, a good plea, a well-drawn deed, a crack in the Parliament House with other lawyer bodies, and perhaps a turn at the golf on a Saturday at e’en.Where do ye come in with your Hieland plaids and claymores?”"
"“哦，”我说，“事实上你几乎没有高地人的野性了。”","“Well,” said I, “it’s a fact ye have little of the wild Highlandman.”"
"“几乎没有？”他说，“不对，小伙子！我生为高地人，所以每当部族的风笛吹响，翩翩起舞的舍我其谁！该部族和该姓氏都已逝去。正如你刚才说你自己的那样，我父亲教会了我这些，还让我拥有了一份不错的职业。要偷渡叛国者们出进，还有法国的招兵买马，真让人受够了！还要偷渡那些新兵，他们的恳求——恳求中透着悲哀！我这才帮年轻的阿德希尔运送了一个人，是我的堂兄，他要求通过婚约明确其财产——一份被褫夺的财产！我告诉他们那简直是荒唐，他们奢求得太多了！而且我为这些几乎跟我自己毫无关系的事奔波忙碌，很有可能还会毁掉我们双方——那是一个污点，会给我们烙上反叛的烙印，就像人们刻在钥匙上的名字一样！而我又能做什么？我是一个斯图尔特族人，你知道，就必须照料我的宗族与家人。随后就在昨天，我们斯图尔特族的一个青年被带到了城堡。为什么？我很清楚：1736年法案，为路易国王征兵。而你会看到，他会唤我去给他当律师，这又会给我的人格烙上另一个污点。说实话：要不是因为，按照希伯来语的说法，我也来自同一个宗族，对这种事情我要是不搁置一边、置之不理，那我就不是人！”","“Little?” quoth he.“Nothing, man!And yet I’m Hieland born, and when the clan pipes, who but me has to dance!The clan and the name, that goes by all.It’s just what you said yourself; my father learned it to me, and a bonny trade I have of it.Treason and traitors, and the smuggling of them out and in; and the French recruiting, weary fall it! and the smuggling through of the recruits; and their pleas—a sorrow of their pleas!Here have I been moving one for young Ardsheil, my cousin; claimed the estate under the marriage contract—a forfeited estate!I told them it was nonsense: muckle they cared!And there was I cocking behind a yadvocate that liked the business as little as myself, for it was fair ruin to the pair of us—a black mark, disaffected, branded on our hurdies, like folk’s names upon their kye!And what can I do?I’m a Stewart, ye see, and must fend for my clan and family.Then no later by than yesterday there was one of our Stewart lads carried to the Castle.What for?I ken fine: Act of 1736: recruiting for King Lewie.And you’ll see, he’ll whistle me in to be his lawyer, and there’ll be another black mark on my chara’ter!I tell you fair: if I but kent the heid of a Hebrew word from the hurdies of it, be dammed but I would fling the whole thing up and turn minister!”"
"“真是艰难的处境。”我说。","“It’s rather a hard position,” said I."
"“注定艰难！”他叫道，“而正是这样才让我这么尊敬你——你不是斯图尔特人——却甘愿为斯图尔特人的事冒这么大的风险。至于为什么，我不知道，除非是一种责任感。”","“Dooms hard!” cries he.“And that’s what makes me think so much of ye—you that’s no Stewart—to stick your head so deep in Stewart business.And for what, I do not know: unless it was the sense of duty.”"
"“我希望是那样。”我说。","“I hope it will be that,” said I."
"“那么，”他说，“这是一种高尚的品质。现在我的办事员就要回来了，先别走，我们吃顿便餐，我们三个人一起。吃完饭后，我会告诉你去找一个很正派的人，他会很乐意留你住宿的。而我也会填满你的口袋，甚至多得连你的口袋都装不下。因为办这件事情价格没有你想得那么高——甚至包括找一艘船也没那么贵。”","“Well,” says he, “it’s a grand quality.But here is my clerk back; and, by your leave, we’ll pick a bit of dinner, all the three of us.When that’s done, I’ll give you the direction of a very decent man, that’ll be very fain to have you for a lodger.And I’ll fill your pockets to ye, forbye, out of your ain bag.For this business’ll not be near as dear as ye suppose—not even the ship part of it.”"
"我给他打个手势，他的办事员已经走近，可以听到我们的谈话了。","I made him a sign that his clerk was within hearing."
"“没关系，你不必在意罗比。”他叫道，“他也是一个斯图尔特族的人，这家伙鬼着呢！他偷渡过很多法国新兵，他和天主教徒做的交易比他脸上的胡须还多。嗨，就是罗宾在处理我的这部分事务。罗布，要渡海的话找谁好？”","“Hoot, ye neednae mind for Robbie,” cries he.“A Stewart, too, puir deevil! and has smuggled out more French recruits and trafficking Papists than what he has hairs upon his face.Why, it’s Robin that manages that branch of my affairs.Who will we have now, Rob, for across the water!”"
"“可以找安迪·斯库格尔，他在‘呼啸’号上。”罗布回答道，“前几天我看见了霍齐亚森，他好像正需要那船呢。还有就是塔姆·斯托博，但是我不太信任塔姆。我已经发现他和一些非常可疑的熟人在密谈，所以要不是重要人物的话，我是不会去找塔姆的。”","“There’ll be Andie Scougal, in the Thristle,” replied Rob.“I saw Hoseason the other day, but it seems he’s wanting the ship.Then there’ll be Tam Stobo; but I’m none so sure of Tam.I’ve seen him colloguing with some gey queer acquaintances; and if was anybody important, I would give Tam the go-by.”"
"“这人的脑袋值二百英镑，罗宾。”斯图尔特说。","“The head’s worth two hundred pounds, Robin,” said Stewart."
"“天哪，那不会是艾伦·布雷克吧！”那办事员叫道。","“Gosh, that’ll no be Alan Breck!” cried the clerk."
"“正是艾伦。”他的主人说。","“Just Alan,” said his master."
"“很棘手啊！那得认真对待才行。”罗宾叫道，“那我找安迪试试，安迪是最佳人选。”","“Weary winds! that’s sayrious,” cried Robin.“I’ll try Andie, then; Andie’ll be the best.”"
"“看来这是一桩大事情。”我说。","“It seems it’s quite a big business,” I observed."
"“鲍尔弗先生，事情还没有说完呢。”斯图尔特说。","“Mr. Balfour, there’s no end to it,” said Stewart."
"“刚才你的办事员提到一个名字，”我继续说道，“霍齐亚森。我想一定是我认识的那个人，‘契约号’双桅船上的霍齐亚森。你居然会去信任他吗？”","“There was a name your clerk mentioned,” I went on: “Hoseason.That must be my man, I think: Hoseason, of the brig Covenant.Would you set your trust on him?”"
"“他对你和艾伦表现得是不大好，”斯图尔特先生说，“不过我认为这个人总体上来看还是相当不错的。如果他已经按照协议把艾伦带上船了的话，在我看来，他就已经证明自己是个可靠的生意人了。你怎么看，罗布？”","“He didnae behave very well to you and Alan,” said Mr. Stewart; “but my mind of the man in general is rather otherwise.If he had taken Alan on board his ship on an agreement, it’s my notion he would have proved a just dealer.How say ye, Rob?”"
"“做这种交易没有比伊莱更诚实的船长了。”那个办事员说，“我信任伊莱——唉，就像信任骑士或者阿平本人一样。”他补充道。","“No more honest skipper in the trade than Eli,” said the clerk.“I would lippen to(2) Eli’s word—ay, if it was the Chevalier, or Appin himsel’,” he added."
"“那么是他把医生带来的，是吗？”那主人问道。","“And it was him that brought the doctor, wasnae’t?” asked the master."
"“正是这个人。”那个办事员说。","“He was the very man,” said the clerk."
"“那我想也是他把医生带回去的？”斯图尔特说。","“And I think he took the doctor back?” says Stewart."
"“是呀，他的毛皮袋塞得满满的了！”罗宾叫道，“而且伊莱知道那件事！”","“Ay, with his sporran full!” cried Robin.“And Eli kent of that!”(3)"
"“唔，看来要看准一个人还真难。”我说。","“Well, it seems it’s hard to ken folk rightly,” said I."
"“那正是你进来时我忘记说的话，鲍尔弗先生！”那律师说道。","“That was just what I forgot when ye came in, Mr. Balfour!” says the Writer."

"第三章　我前往皮尔里格","CHAPTER III—I GO TO PILRIG"
"第二天早晨，在新入住的地方，我一醒来就赶紧起床，并穿上了新衣服。狼吞虎咽地吃完早餐, 我就开始了自己的冒险行程。艾伦嘛，我还可以抱希望，已经得到了照料。可是詹姆斯这事好像更难办一些，我不由地想到这件事也许会让我付出极大的代价，甚至会像所有我曾咨询过的人所说的那样。这好似我终于登上山顶却倒了下来。我曾经努力攀登，经历那么多艰难的考验，终于变得富有，得到了认可，穿上了城里人的衣服，而且在腰间配了一把剑，可是所有这一切只不过是为了在最后一刻自杀，而且还是最糟糕的一种自杀，就是在国王的指控下上绞架。","The next morning, I was no sooner awake in my new lodging than I was up and into my new clothes; and no sooner the breakfast swallowed, than I was forth on my adventurers.Alan, I could hope, was fended for; James was like to be a more difficult affair, and I could not but think that enterprise might cost me dear, even as everybody said to whom I had opened my opinion.It seemed I was come to the top of the mountain only to cast myself down; that I had clambered up, through so many and hard trials, to be rich, to be recognised, to wear city clothes and a sword to my side, all to commit mere suicide at the last end of it, and the worst kind of suicide, besides, which is to get hanged at the King’s charges."
"我这么做是为了什么？我一边自问着，一边沿着大街往下走，并由利斯巷向北而出。首先我对自己说这是为了救詹姆斯·斯图尔特。我回忆起他的悲痛、他妻子的哭声以及我在那种情形下所作出的那么一两句承诺，这回忆毫无疑问强烈地影响了我。同时我想到：不论詹姆斯是死在他自己的床上还是绞刑架上，这件事都是（或者应该是）和作为我父亲儿子的我毫不相干的。诚然，他是艾伦的表亲，但是他和艾伦的关系那么远，所以最好的做法就是保持缄默，而让国王和阿盖尔公爵，还有成群的乌鸦，用他们自己的方式去啄食他们那位同族人的尸骨吧。我也不会忘记，我们一起经历患难的时侯，詹姆斯不论是对艾伦还是对我都没有表现过特别的担心。","What was I doing it for?I asked, as I went down the high Street and out north by Leith Wynd.First I said it was to save James Stewart; and no doubt the memory of his distress, and his wife’s cries, and a word or so I had let drop on that occasion worked upon me strongly.At the same time I reflected that it was (or ought to be) the most indifferent matter to my father’s son, whether James died in his bed or from a scaffold.He was Alan’s cousin, to be sure; but so far as regarded Alan, the best thing would be to lie low, and let the King, and his Grace of Argyll, and the corbie crows, pick the bones of his kinsman their own way.Nor could I forget that, while we were all in the pot together, James had shown no such particular anxiety whether for Alan or me."
"接着我又想到，我这么做是为了正义。我认为正义这个词很贴切，并由此推论出（既然我们都已深陷于政治当中，该词对于我们每一个人来说都有点儿不便提起）这一切的关键还必须得是正义，任何无辜者的死亡都会是整个社会的创伤。再接下来，正是因为想到了弟兄的责怪让我转而考虑他的论点，让我觉得自己如果假装很关心这些重大的事情，那就很羞耻。同时这也向我说明，我只是一个夸夸其谈、自命不凡的小毛孩，对兰基勒和斯图尔特说了大话，结果受困于为满足自己大肆吹嘘的那种虚荣心了。不仅如此，他还会从另一方面抨击我，因为他指责我是狡猾的懦夫，只想冒极小的风险来换得更大的安全保障。毫无疑问，在我申明并澄清自己之前，任何一天我都有可能遇见芒戈·坎贝尔或者郡县的官员，一经认出，我就会因涉嫌阿平凶杀案而被捕。可是，同样毫无疑问，一旦我能够成功地发表声明，此后我就可以更加自由地呼吸了。但是当我正视并深思这个论点时，我又觉得没有什么可感到羞耻的了。至于其他，“这里有两条路，”我想着，“而两条路都通向同一个地方。如果我能救詹姆斯而他却被绞死了，这样就不公平。不过要是我说了那么多却又无所作为，那未免也太荒谬了。我已经事先夸下了海口，这对格伦斯的詹姆斯来说很幸运。不过对我自己也不是那么不幸，因为我有责任去做正确的事情。我有着绅士之名和相应的财富，我在本质上缺乏的就是那么一点点应尽的责任了。”随后我想到这是一种异教徒精神，于是在自己内心祷告，祈求给予我可能缺乏的勇气，祈求我可以像士兵奔赴战场那样勇往直前地去承担责任，然后像很多士兵那样可以平安归来。","Next it came upon me I was acting for the sake of justice: and I thought that a fine word, and reasoned it out that (since we dwelt in polities, at some discomfort to each one of us) the main thing of all must still be justice, and the death of any innocent man a wound upon the whole community.Next, again, it was the Accuser of the Brethren that gave me a turn of his argument; bade me think shame for pretending myself concerned in these high matters, and told me I was but a prating vain child, who had spoken big words to Rankeillor and to Stewart, and held myself bound upon my vanity to make good that boastfulness.Nay, and he hit me with the other end of the stick; for he accused me of a kind of artful cowardice, going about at the expense of a little risk to purchase greater safety.No doubt, until I had declared and cleared myself, I might any day encounter Mungo Campbell or the sheriff’s officer, and be recognised, and dragged into the Appin murder by the heels; and, no doubt, in case I could manage my declaration with success, I should breathe more free for ever after.But when I looked this argument full in the face I could see nothing to be ashamed of.As for the rest, “Here are the two roads,” I thought, “and both go to the same place.It’s unjust that James should hang if I can save him; and it would be ridiculous in me to have talked so much and then do nothing.It’s lucky for James of the Glens that I have boasted beforehand; and none so unlucky for myself, because now I’m committed to do right.I have the name of a gentleman and the means of one; it would be a poor duty that I was wanting in the essence.”And then I thought this was a Pagan spirit, and said a prayer in to myself, asking for what courage I might lack, and that I might go straight to my duty like a soldier to battle, and come off again scatheless, as so many do."
"这一连串的推理让我态度更加坚决，虽然还远远没有打消我对自己周围危险的感觉，同时，我自己很有可能（如果我继续下去的话）会踏上绞架的阶梯的感觉也还在。那是一个普通、晴朗的早晨，但是却刮着东风。风中的丝丝寒意浸入我的血液，给我带来秋日的感觉，让我感觉到枯死的落叶，还有逝者躺在墓穴中的尸骨。若是我在命运之巅却为他人之事丧命的话，那似乎是有魔鬼在其中作祟了。在考尔顿山的山顶上，尽管还不是一年中放风筝娱乐的时节，还是有些孩子一边叫一边奔跑着在放风筝。这些风筝在空中显得很平静，我注意到有一个大风筝御风直上、飞得很高，可是接着突然坠落在棘豆丛里。见此情景，我不由联想到自己：“戴维也会有此下场。”","This train of reasoning brought me to a more resolved complexion; though it was far from closing up my sense of the dangers that surrounded me, nor of how very apt I was (if I went on) to stumble on the ladder of the gallows.It was a plain, fair morning, but the wind in the east.The little chill of it sang in my blood, and gave me a feeling of the autumn, and the dead leaves, and dead folks’ bodies in their graves.It seemed the devil was in it, if I was to die in that tide of my fortunes and for other folks’ affairs.On the top of the Calton Hill, though it was not the customary time of year for that diversion, some children were crying and running with their kites.These toys appeared very plain against the sky; I remarked a great one soar on the wind to a high altitude and then plump among the whins; and I thought to myself at sight of it, “There goes Davie.”"
"我所走的路要越过穆特山，然后从田野中斜坡上的一个小村庄的尽头穿过。那里家家户户都传出织布机的嗡嗡声，蜜蜂在花园里嬉闹，我看到那些邻居们在门阶上用奇怪的口音在聊天。后来我才发现这里是皮卡第，这个村庄里住着为利宁公司劳作的法国纺织工们。在这里我得到最新的指点，前往我的目的地皮尔里格。没走多远，就在路边上，我看见了一副绞架，上面有两个戴着镣铐被绞死的男子。按照习俗，他们全身浸透了焦油。风从他们身边吹过，镣铐哗哗作响，一些鸟在这两具怪异、摇晃的尸身周围盘旋并鸣叫着。这景象突然扑面而来，就像我的恐惧的写照，我简直不敢细看也不愿陷入这种很不舒服的感觉。正因为如此，当我转身想避开那绞架时，却差一点撞到一个古怪的老太婆。她坐在绞架的一个支柱后面，一边点着头，一边大声地自言自语着，还礼貌地挥手致意。","My way lay over Mouter’s Hill, and through an end of a clachan on the braeside among fields.There was a whirr of looms in it went from house to house; bees bummed in the gardens; the neighbours that I saw at the doorsteps talked in a strange tongue; and I found out later that this was Picardy, a village where the French weavers wrought for the Linen Company.Here I got a fresh direction for Pilrig, my destination; and a little beyond, on the wayside, came by a gibbet and two men hanged in chains.They were dipped in tar, as the manner is; the wind span them, the chains clattered, and the birds hung about the uncanny jumping-jacks and cried.The sight coming on me suddenly, like an illustration of my fears, I could scarce be done with examining it and drinking in discomfort.And, as I thus turned and turned about the gibbet, what should I strike on, but a weird old wife, that sat behind a leg of it, and nodded, and talked aloud to herself with becks and courtesies."
"“这两个人是谁，大妈？”我指着尸体问道。","“Who are these two, mother?”I asked, and pointed to the corpses."
"“你面善，必有福！”她喊道，“那是我的两个心肝宝贝，就是我那两个大心肝宝贝，是我亲爱的宝贝啊。”","“A blessing on your precious face!” she cried.“Twa joes(1) o’mine: just two o’ my old joes, my hinny dear.”"
"“他们为什么遭受了绞刑？”我问。","“What did they suffer for?” I asked."
"“噢，仅仅为了这样的正当理由，”她说，“我早就对他们预言过这样的结局。两个苏格兰先令，别无其他的原因了，两个健康活泼的年轻人就为此而被绞死了！他们从布劳切顿的一个小孩那里拿了这些钱。”","“Ou, just for the guid cause,” said she.“Aften I spaed to them the way that it would end.Twa shillin’ Scots: no pickle mair; and there are twa bonny callants hingin’ for ‘t!They took it frae a wean(2) belanged to Brouchton.”"
"“唉！”我对自己而不是对着那个痴傻的下贱女人说道，“他们就因为那么点小事而变成了这样一副模样？这的确是失去了一切呀。”","“Ay!” said I to myself, and not to the daft limmer, “and did they come to such a figure for so poor a business?This is to lose all indeed.”"
"“把你的手掌给我，亲爱的，”她说，“让我预测一下你的命运。”","“Gie’s your loof, (3) hinny,” says she, “and let me spae your weird to ye.”"
"“不用了，大妈，”我说，“我对自己已经看得够远了。对前头的事看得太远会很怪的。”","“No, mother,” said I, “I see far enough the way I am.It’s an unco thing to see too far in front.”"
"“我在你的血脉里看到，”她说，“有一位漂亮的少女，她有双明亮的眼睛，还有一位衣着华丽的小个子男人和一个戴着扑粉假发的大人物。小伙子啊，那里还有绞架的阴影，就横立在你的道路上。把你的手掌给我，亲爱的，就让老梅伦来好好预测一下你的命运吧。”","“I read it in your bree,” she said.“There’s a bonnie lassie that has bricht een, and there’s a wee man in a braw coat, and a big man in a pouthered wig, and there’s the shadow of the wuddy, (4) joe, that lies braid across your path.Gie’s your loof, hinny, and let Auld Merren spae it to ye bonny.”"
"这两点猜测恰巧像是指艾伦和詹姆斯·莫尔的女儿，这深深地打击了我。我给她丢了半个便士，赶紧逃离这可怕的女人，而她则继续坐在受绞刑者那晃动的阴影下玩着算命的把戏。","The two chance shots that seemed to point at Alan and the daughter of James More struck me hard; and I fled from the eldritch creature, casting her a baubee, which she continued to sit and play with under the moving shadows of the hanged."
"要不是这次遭遇，我沿利斯路堤道而下之行本来会更愉快一些的。老城墙在原野上一路延伸，以前我还从来没有看见过这样精耕细作的农田。此外，我很高兴能走这么远来到宁静的乡下。但是绞架下的镣铐声在我头脑中哗哗回响，还有那老巫婆的忧郁以及种种怪样，而且我还想到了那两具死尸，这些都啃噬着我的灵魂。上绞架看来是一桩严重的事情。一个人不论是为了两个苏格兰先令，还是（像斯图尔特先生那样）出于责任感，一旦他被涂上焦油、带上镣铐，而且被绞死了，似乎区别都不大了。戴维·鲍尔弗也可能被绞死，而其他青年有事路过时也会轻看他的，那痴傻的老妇人坐在绞架的一边预言他们的命运，还有清新文雅的少女从旁走过，她们会看向另一边，而且还捂着鼻子。我清清楚楚地看到了她们，她们长着灰色的眼睛，而且她们头上的纱罩颜色也是德拉蒙德风格的。","My way down the causeway of Leith Walk would have been more pleasant to me but for this encounter.The old rampart ran among fields, the like of them I had never seen for artfulness of agriculture; I was pleased, besides, to be so far in the still countryside; but the shackles of the gibbet clattered in my head; and the mope and mows of the old witch, and the thought of the dead men, hag-rode my spirits.To hang on a gallows, that seemed a hard case; and whether a man came to hang there for two shillings Scots, or (as Mr. Stewart had it) from the sense of duty, once he was tarred and shackled and hung up, the difference seemed small.There might David Balfour hang, and other lads pass on their errands and think light of him; and old daft limmers sit at a leg-foot and spae their fortunes; and the clean genty maids go by, and look to the other aide, and hold a nose.I saw them plain, and they had grey eyes, and their screens upon their heads were of the Drummed colours."
"正因为如此，当皮尔里格映入我的眼帘时，虽然我的态度仍然相当坚定，但是我的精神却已经极度消沉了。在几片清新细嫩的树林中，一栋宜人的山形墙房子矗立在小路旁边。我走过去的时候，领主的马已经上好鞍具立在门边，而他本人则在书房内。他在书房里种种学术著作和乐器中接见了我，因为他不仅深谙哲学之道，还极富有音乐天赋。他首先非常友善地向我致意，然后在看完兰基勒的信后，他热心地表示他将听从我的安排。","I was thus in the poorest of spirits, though still pretty resolved, when I came in view of Pilrig, a pleasant gabled house set by the walkside among some brave young woods.The laird’s horse was standing saddled at the door as I came up, but himself was in the study, where he received me in the midst of learned works and musical instruments, for he was not only a deep philosopher but much of a musician.He greeted me at first pretty well, and when he had read Rankeillor’s letter, placed himself obligingly at my disposal."
"“有什么事情？戴维兄弟！”他说，“既然看样子我们是亲戚——我到底能为你做些什么！给普雷斯顿格兰奇捎句话！无疑那很容易做到。但是应该捎句什么话呢？”","“And what is it, cousin David!” said he—“since it appears that we are cousins—what is this that I can do for you!A word to Prestongrange!Doubtless that is easily given.But what should be the word?”"
"“鲍尔弗先生，”我说，“如果我把整件事原原本本地告诉您，我的看法是（也是之前兰基勒的看法）您是不会愿意参与这件事情的。”","“Mr. Balfour,” said I, “if I were to tell you my whole story the way it fell out, it’s my opinion (and it was Rankeillor’s before me) that you would be very little made up with it.”"
"“听你这么说，我感到很抱歉，我的本家亲戚。”他说。","“I am sorry to hear this of you, kinsman,” says he."
"“我是不该叨扰您的，鲍尔弗先生，”我说，“我既然已经承担此事，也就没有什么让我后悔的，您也不必对我感到抱歉，这只不过是人类共同的弱点而已。‘亚当的第一桩罪，就是缺乏最初的正确判断，以及我全部本性的堕落。’我只能回答这么多，我还希望可以得到指教去何处求助。”我说，因为我从他的神情中断定，如果我熟知《教义问答手册》，他会对我印象更好。“但是在世间诚信方面，我也没有大错误需要自责。我所遭遇的重重困难并非我意愿，（就我所知）也不是我的过错。我的难处在于我已经深陷复杂的政治漩涡之中，而对于这一点可以断定您会乐意不去深究的。”","“I must not take that at your hands, Mr. Balfour,” said I; “I have nothing to my charge to make me sorry, or you for me, but just the common infirmities of mankind.‘The guilt of Adam’s first sin, the want of original righteousness, and the corruption of my whole nature,’ so much I must answer for, and I hope I have been taught where to look for help,” I said; for I judged from the look of the man he would think the better of me if I knew my questions. (5)“But in the way of worldly honour I have no great stumble to reproach myself with; and my difficulties have befallen me very much against my will and (by all that I can see) without my fault.My trouble is to have become dipped in a political complication, which it is judged you would be blythe to avoid a knowledge of.”"
"“那么，很好，戴维先生，”他回答，“看到你和兰基勒描述得完全一样，我很高兴。至于你所说的复杂的政治漩涡，你只不过是要我公正行事罢了。我的书房从来就不会受到怀疑，确实是在被怀疑的领域之外。问题是，”他说，“若是我对此事一无所知的话，我能够很好地帮助你吗？”","“Why, very well, Mr. David,” he replied, “I am pleased to see you are all that Rankeillor represented.And for what you say of political complications, you do me no more than justice.It is my study to be beyond suspicion, and indeed outside the field of it.The question is,” says he, “how, if I am to know nothing of the matter, I can very well assist you?”"
"“那么，先生，”我说，“我建议您给那位大人写封信，就说我是一个出身于通情达理的好家庭的年轻人，而且颇具财力。我相信这两点都是事情的关键。”","“Why sir,” said I, “I propose you should write to his lordship, that I am a young man of reasonable good family and of good means: both of which I believe to be the case.”"
"“我在兰基勒的信上已经看到这句话了，”鲍尔弗先生说，“而且我认为那是一个应对严峻局面的保证。”","“I have Rankeillor’s word for it,” said Mr. Balfour, “and I count that a warran-dice against all deadly.”"
"“对此您还可以加上（如果您相信我说的都是真话），我是一个虔诚的教徒，忠实于乔治国王，而且也受过这样的教育。”我继续说道。","“To which you might add (if you will take my word for so much) that I am a good churchman, loyal to King George, and so brought up,” I went on."
"“这些都不会对你不利。”鲍尔弗先生说。","“None of which will do you any harm,” said Mr. Balfour."
"“那么您可以接着说，我是因紧要时刻、事关重大才去找大人的，事关国王陛下和司法管理。”我建议道。","“Then you might go on to say that I sought his lordship on a matter of great moment, connected with His Majesty’s service and the administration of justice,” I suggested."
"“因为我还没有听说这件事，”那位领主说，“我会觉得自己没有资格这么说。既然已经说出‘紧要时刻’，那么‘时刻’指什么也要说明白。至于其他的，我可以按照你的建议自己去说清楚的。”","“As I am not to hear the matter,” says the laird, “I will not take upon myself to qualify its weight.‘Great moment’ therefore falls, and ‘moment’ along with it.For the rest I might express myself much as you propose.”"
"“那么，先生，”我一边说着，一边用大拇指揉了揉脖子，“接下来我恳切希望您能为我的安全保障作出一点承诺。”","“And then, sir,” said I, and rubbed my neck a little with my thumb, “then I would be very desirous if you could slip in a word that might perhaps tell for my protection.”"
"“安全保障？”他说，“保障你的安全！这种说法有点儿让我沮丧。如果这件事真有这么危险的话，我自认我不大情愿被蒙在鼓里去掺和了。”","“Protection?” says he, “for your protection!Here is a phrase that somewhat dampens me.If the matter be so dangerous, I own I would be a little loath to move in it blindfold.”"
"“我相信我两句话就能够说出关键所在。”我说。","“I believe I could indicate in two words where the thing sticks,” said I."
"“也许那样最好。”他说。","“Perhaps that would be the best,” said he."
"“好吧，就是阿平凶杀案一事。”我说。","“Well, it’s the Appin murder,” said I."
"他举起双手。“先生！先生！”他叫道。","He held up both his hands.“Sirs! sirs!” cried he."
"通过他的面部表情和声音，我觉得我已经失去这个帮手了。","I thought by the expression of his face and voice that I had lost my helper."
"“让我来解释……”我开始说。","“Let me explain...”I began."
"“我诚恳地谢谢你，我不想再听此事了，”他说，“我谢绝听到有关此事的更多信息。为了你和兰基勒的名声，或许也有点儿为你本人，我会竭尽所能帮助你。但是我不愿再听有关情况。我首先要明确的责任就是警告你。这趟水深不可测，戴维先生，况且你还年轻。一定要小心，务必三思。”","“I thank you kindly, I will hear no more of it,” says he.“I decline in toto to hear more of it.For your name’s sake and Rankeillor’s, and perhaps a little for your own, I will do what I can to help you; but I will hear no more upon the facts.And it is my first clear duty to warn you.These are deep waters, Mr. David, and you are a young man.Be cautious and think twice.”"
"“应该说我不止是三思了，鲍尔弗先生，”我说，“我再次提醒您注意兰基勒的信，在信里（我希望而且相信）他已经表示赞成我的计划了。”","“It is to be supposed I will have thought oftener than that, Mr. Balfour,” said I, “and I will direct your attention again to Rankeillor’s letter, where (I hope and believe) he has registered his approval of that which I design.”"
"“好，好，”他说，然后再次说道，“好，好！我将竭尽全力帮助你。”他拿出一支笔和纸，坐着思考了一会儿，开始仔细斟酌着写起来。“我猜兰基勒同意你的想法了？”不一会儿，他问道。","“Well, well,” said he; and then again, “Well, well!I will do what I can for you.”There with he took a pen and paper, sat a while in thought, and began to write with much consideration.“I understand that Rankeillor approved of what you have in mind?” he asked presently."
"“在讨论了一番之后，先生，他吩咐我以上帝的名义勇往直前。”我说。","“After some discussion, sir, he bade me to go forward in God’s name,” said I."
"“那就是出师之名了。”鲍尔弗先生说，又重新开始写起来。不久，他签了字，重读所写的内容，然后再次转向我。“好了，戴维先生，”他说，“这是一封介绍信，我会不密封就盖印章，就这样开着封交给你，按礼节是这么要求的。但是，由于我是在不知情的情况下写的，所以我将当着你的面读一读，这样你就可以弄清楚这封信最终是否能够保护你。","“That is the name to go in,” said Mr. Balfour, and resumed his writing.Presently, he signed, re-read what he had written, and addressed me again.“Now here, Mr. David,” said he, “is a letter of introduction, which I will seal without closing, and give into your hands open, as the form requires.But, since I am acting in the dark, I will just read it to you, so that you may see if it will secure your end—"

"我的同宗招待我吃了一顿饭，他说这是“权尽同宗之谊”，而我认为我最好尽快赶回去。我没有别的想法，只想着要完成下一阶段的事，只想着自己要全力以赴。对于一个像我现在这样处境的人来说，虽然在走近大门时显出一副迟疑不决的样子，但是内心想进去的诱惑力却极其强烈。所以当我来到普雷斯顿格兰奇的府邸，却获悉他已经外出时，我愈发感到失望。那一刻以及随后的几个小时里，我以为那是真的。可是后来我可以肯定检察总长已经回家了，而且就在隔壁房间很愉快地和他的朋友们在一起。也许我来访之事已经被忘却了。要不是因为我一定要立即完成当众声明过的事情，才能良心安宁得以入眠，我好几次都想一走了之。起初我读了读书，因为他们领我去的那个小房间里摆放着各种各样的书籍。但是我担心读书也没什么用。天气转为多云，黄昏比平时来得更早。我所在的房间只有一扇窗户上有孔透光进来，最后我不得不放弃读书这种消遣方式（也仅仅为消遣而已），剩下的时间我只能心情沉重、无聊地等待着。附近一间房里人们的谈话声，古钢琴悠扬的乐声，一度还有一位女士的唱歌声，算是在陪伴我了。","My kinsman kept me to a meal, “for the honour of the roof,” he said; and I believe I made the better speed on my return.I had no thought but to be done with the next stage, and have myself fully committed; to a person circumstanced as I was, the appearance of closing a door on hesitation and temptation was itself extremely tempting; and I was the more disappointed, when I came to Prestongrange’s house, to be informed he was abroad.I believe it was true at the moment, and for some hours after; and then I have no doubt the Advocate came home again, and enjoyed himself in a neighbouring chamber among friends, while perhaps the very fact of my arrival was forgotten.I would have gone away a dozen times, only for this strong drawing to have done with my declaration out of hand and be able to lay me down to sleep with a free conscience.At first I read, for the little cabinet where I was left contained a variety of books.But I fear I read with little profit; and the weather falling cloudy, the dusk coming up earlier than usual, and my cabinet being lighted with but a loophole of a window, I was at last obliged to desist from this diversion (such as it was), and pass the rest of my time of waiting in a very burthensome vacuity.The sound of people talking in a near chamber, the pleasant note of a harpsichord, and once the voice of a lady singing, bore me a kind of company."
"我不知道时辰，但是天早就黑了。当小房间的门打开时，借着其背后的灯光，我才发觉一个高个子男人站在门口。我立刻站了起来。","I do not know the hour, but the darkness was long come, when the door of the cabinet opened, and I was aware, by the light behind him, of a tall figure of a man upon the threshold.I rose at once."
"“有人吗？”他问道,“是谁在那里？”","“Is anybody there?” he asked.“Who in that?”"
"“我是从皮尔里格领主那里带信来给检察总长大人的。”我说。","“I am bearer of a letter from the laird of Pilrig to the Lord Advocate,” said I."
"“你在这里已经等了很久吗？”","“Have you been here long?” he asked."
"“我不会贸然地估计有几个钟头了。”我说。","“I would not like to hazard an estimate of how many hours,” said I."
"“我还是头一遭听人这么说，”他一边回答，一边轻声笑了起来，“那帮小子肯定是把你给忘记了。不过你终究还是赶上趟了，因为我就是普雷斯顿格兰奇。”","“It is the first I hear of it,” he replied, with a chuckle.“The lads must have forgotten you.But you are in the bit at last, for I am Prestongrange.”"
"这么说着，他就从我面前走过，进了另一个房间，（根据他的示意）我跟了进去。在那里他点亮了一根蜡烛，然后站在办公桌前。这是一个长方形的房间，比例均衡，一排排全部摆放着书籍。角落里微弱闪烁的烛光隐隐照出那人英俊的面容和坚毅的表情。他的脸映着红光，双眼晶莹闪亮。在他坐下之前，我注意到他前后摇晃着。无疑，他刚刚吃过丰盛的晚餐，但是他的思路和语言仍然清晰流畅。","So saying, he passed before me into the next room, whither (upon his sign) I followed him, and where he lit a candle and took his place before a business-table.It was a long room, of a good proportion, wholly lined with books.That small spark of light in a corner struck out the man’s handsome person and strong face.He was flushed, his eye watered and sparkled, and before he sat down I observed him to sway back and forth.No doubt, he had been supping liberally; but his mind and tongue were under full control."
"“好吧，先生，你请坐，”他说，“让我们先看看皮尔里格的信吧。”","“Well, sir, sit ye down,” said he, “and let us see Pilrig’s letter.”"
"他先是粗略地浏览了一遍，看到我的姓名时，他抬头看看又低下头，但是我觉得我注意到了他在看最后几句话时注意力倍加集中，而且我敢肯定他看了两遍。在这期间你们可以猜想得到，我的心怦怦地在跳，因为我现在已经破釜沉舟，只能毅然走上战场了。","He glanced it through in the beginning carelessly, looking up and bowing when he came to my name; but at the last words I thought I observed his attention to redouble, and I made sure he read them twice.All this while you are to suppose my heart was beating, for I had now crossed my Rubicon and was come fairly on the field of battle."
"“我很高兴能与你相识，鲍尔弗先生。”他看完信后说,“让我给你来一杯红葡萄酒吧。”","“I am pleased to make your acquaintance, Mr. Balfour,” he said, when he had done.“Let me offer you a glass of claret.”"
"“谢谢您的好意，大人，我认为这对我不太合适。”我说,“我来这里，正如信中所提到的，是为一些对我来说重要的事情。而且，因为我不太习惯喝酒，所以我有可能很快受到影响。”","“Under your favour, my lord, I think it would scarce be fair on me,” said I.“I have come here, as the letter will have mentioned, on a business of some gravity to myself; and, as I am little used with wine, I might be the sooner affected.”"
"“由你决定好了。”他说,“但是如果你允许的话，我想我就自己来喝这瓶酒。”","“You shall be the judge,” said he.“But if you will permit, I believe I will even have the bottle in myself.”"
"他按了一个铃，接着一个男仆走了进来，按照所发的信号，带来了红酒和眼镜。","He touched a bell, and a footman came, as at a signal, bringing wine and glasses."
"“你确定不和我一起喝吗？”检察总长问道,“好，来为我们进一步的友谊干杯！我能用什么方式帮助你？”","“You are sure you will not join me?” asked the Advocate.“Well, here is to our better acquaintance!In what way can I serve you?”"
"“我应该，也许，首先告诉您，大人，我在这里得到了您诚恳热切的招待。”我说。","“I should, perhaps, begin by telling you, my lord, that I am here at your own pressing invitation,” said I."
"“你只是从某个地方先认识了我吧，”他说，“因为我得承认我觉得在今晚之前我还从来没有听说过你。”","“You have the advantage of me somewhere,” said he, “for I profess I think I never heard of you before this evening.”"
"“对，大人，我的名字对您来说确实很陌生。”我说，“然而您有一段时间曾经非常希望和我相识，而且还公开宣称过这一点。”","“Right, my lord; the name is, indeed, new to you,” said I.“And yet you have been for some time extremely wishful to make my acquaintance, and have declared the same in public.”"
"“我希望你能给我提示一下。”他说，“我可不是丹尼尔。”","“I wish you would afford me a clue,” says he.“I am no Daniel.”"
"“也许可以当做是这么回事，”我说，“如果说我是在开玩笑的话——其实又完全不是在开玩笑——我认为我可以向大人您索取两百英镑。”","“It will perhaps serve for such,” said I, “that if I was in a jesting humour—which is far from the case—I believe I might lay a claim on your lordship for two hundred pounds.”"
"“此话怎讲？”他询问道。","“In what sense?” he inquired."
"“就算是给我个人提供的酬劳。”我说。","“In the sense of rewards offered for my person,” said I."
"他断然将眼镜扔到一边，在椅子上笔直地坐了起来，先前他还是懒洋洋地靠在那里的。“我该如何理解？”他说。","He thrust away his glass once and for all, and sat straight up in the chair where he had been previously lolling.“What am I to understand?” said he."
"“一个十八岁左右、高大壮实的小伙子，”我引用原话说道，“低地口音、没有胡须。”","“A tall strong lad of about eighteen,” I quoted, “speaks like a Lowlander and has no beard.”"
"“我听出那些话了，”他说，“要是你没有考虑周全，只是到这里来闹着玩的，这些话只可能对你的安全极为不利。”","“I recognise those words,” said he, “which, if you have come here with any ill-judged intention of amusing yourself, are like to prove extremely prejudicial to your safety.”"
"“我的目的正在于此，”我回答说，“这完全跟生死一般重要，而您已经彻底明白我的意思了。我就是那个男孩，格伦努尔被射中时我正在和他说话。”","“My purpose in this,” I replied, “is just entirely as serious as life and death, and you have understood me perfectly.I am the boy who was speaking with Glenure when he was shot.”"
"“（看见你在这里）我只能推测你是来为自己脱罪的。”他说。","“I can only suppose (seeing you here) that you claim to be innocent,” said he."
"“这个推论很清楚，”我说，“我是对乔治王非常忠诚的臣民，但是如果有什么要责怪我自己的话，那就是我本应该更加谨慎，不走进你的书斋的。”","“The inference is clear,” I said.“I am a very loyal subject to King George, but if I had anything to reproach myself with, I would have had more discretion than to walk into your den.”"
"“那样我会很高兴的，”他说，“鲍尔弗先生，这起恐怖罪行影响极其恶劣，绝不能对其心慈手软。这是血淋淋的教训，惨不忍睹。血已经流向国王陛下和我们整个法律框架的直接对立面,是谁所为他们知道，都是些公然的敌对分子。这一点我非常清楚。我不否认我认为这桩罪行是直接针对国王陛下个人的。”","“I am glad of that,” said he.“This horrid crime, Mr. Balfour, is of a dye which cannot permit any clemency.Blood has been barbarously shed.It has been shed in direct opposition to his Majesty and our whole frame of laws, by those who are their known and public oppugnants.I take a very high sense of this.I will not deny that I consider the crime as directly personal to his Majesty.”"
"“可是很遗憾，大人，”我有点儿冷淡地补充道，“应该是直接针对另一位可能并不为人知的重要人物吧。”","“And unfortunately, my lord,” I added, a little drily, “directly personal to another great personage who may be nameless.”"
"“如果你说这些话还有什么含义的话，我必须告诉你我认为这些话对臣民是不适合的。要是这些话是在公开场合说的，我就会尽我的职责去加以留意了，”他说，“在我看来你还没有意识到你严峻的处境，否则你会更加小心，而不会去用这些藐视司法公正的话语来让你的处境恶化了。司法公正，在这个国家，在鄙人手中，是绝不偏袒任何人的。”","“If you mean anything by those words, I must tell you I consider them unfit for a good subject; and were they spoke publicly I should make it my business to take note of them,” said he.“You do not appear to me to recognise the gravity of your situation, or you would be more careful not to pejorate the same by words which glance upon the purity of justice.Justice, in this country, and in my poor hands, is no respecter of persons.”"
"“您对我的话未免看得过重了，大人，”我说，“我只不过复述了国人的普通言谈而已，在我此番前来的路上到处都可以听到各种不同意见的人在这样议论。”","“You give me too great a share in my own speech, my lord,” said I.“I did but repeat the common talk of the country, which I have heard everywhere, and from men of all opinions as I came along.”"
"“等你更为谨慎的时候，你就会明白这类言谈不宜去听，更不宜去复述，”检察总长说，“不过我认定你是没有恶意的。我们都尊敬的那个贵族在最近于附近发生的残暴行径中受伤了，这是事实，但他地位很高，不会受到诽谤的。阿盖尔公爵——你看我对你可是坦诚相待的——像我一样很关注此事，我们两个人一定会按照司法职责为效忠于国王陛下而行事的。在这个动荡的年代里，我希望所有人在家族怨仇方面都一样手脚干净。但是这件事碰巧的是，一位坎贝尔家族的人尽职牺牲了——难道只有坎贝尔家族的人自愿在这条路上冲锋陷阵？我想说，虽然本人不姓坎贝尔——何况他们那个大家庭的族长（为我们所有人的利益）正好还是现任的高等法院院长，在乡下的每一家小客栈里都有一些思想狭隘的人和心怀不满的人在热切地乱嚼舌头。而我发现连鲍尔弗先生这样的年轻绅士也如此草率轻信，让自己成为他们的应声虫了。”他就像在法庭上一样高谈阔论了一番，而后再次放低声音恢复了绅士的风度。“把所有这一切先放一边，”他说，“现在的问题是，我应该知道我要为你做些什么。”","“When you are come to more discretion you will understand such talk in not to be listened to, how much less repeated,” says the Advocate.“But I acquit you of an ill intention.That nobleman, whom we all honour, and who has indeed been wounded in a near place by the late barbarity, sits too high to be reached by these aspersions.The Duke of Argyle—you see that I deal plainly with you—takes it to heart as I do, and as we are both bound to do by our judicial functions and the service of his Majesty; and I could wish that all hands, in this ill age, were equally clean of family rancour.But from the accident that this is a Campbell who has fallen martyr to his duty—as who else but the Campbells have ever put themselves foremost on that path?I may say it, who am no Campbell—and that the chief of that great house happens (for all our advantages) to be the present head of the College of Justice, small minds and disaffected tongues are set agog in every changehouse in the country; and I find a young gentleman like Mr. Balfour so ill-advised as to make himself their echo.”So much he spoke with a very oratorical delivery, as if in court, and then declined again upon the manner of a gentleman.“All this apart,” said he.“It now remains that I should learn what I am to do with you.”"
"“我却一直认为，应该是我聆听大人您的指教。”我说。","“I had thought it was rather I that should learn the same from your lordship,” said I."
"“呃，的确，”检察总长说，“可是，你看，你到我这里来是受到了大力推荐的。这封信上有个非常忠诚的辉格党人的签名。”他说，并且从桌上把信拿起来示意了一下。“而且——超越司法之外，鲍尔弗先生——总还会有些调整的可能性。我告诉你，我预先告诉你，你要更加注意保护自己，你的命运掌握在我一个人的手里。在这样的事情上（诚惶诚恐地说）我比国王陛下更有权力。要是你能让我高兴——当然是让我的良心感到满意——就我们的这次会面而言，我跟你保证，这事就你知我知。”","“Ay, true,” says the Advocate.“But, you see, you come to me well recommended.There is a good honest Whig name to this letter,” says he, picking it up a moment from the table.“And—extra-judicially, Mr, Balfour—there is always the possibility of some arrangement, I tell you, and I tell you beforehand that you may be the more upon your guard, your fate lies with me singly.In such a matter (be it said with reverence) I am more powerful than the King’s Majesty; and should you please me—and of course satisfy my conscience—in what remains to be held of our interview, I tell you it may remain between ourselves.”"
"“什么意思？”我问。","“Meaning how?” I asked."
"“嗯，我的意思是这样的，鲍尔弗先生，”他说，“如果你让我满意，则无人会知晓你到过我的住所，你可能也注意到了我甚至连办事员都没有叫过来。”","“Why, I mean it thus, Mr. Balfour,” said he, “that if you give satisfaction, no soul need know so much as that you visited my house; and you may observe that I do not even call my clerk.”"
"我明白他在想什么了。“我想没有必要告诉任何人我此次的造访，”我说，“虽然我还不清楚我此行具体会有什么样的收获。我对此丝豪不感到惭愧。”","I saw what way he was driving.“I suppose it is needless anyone should be informed upon my visit,” said I, “though the precise nature of my gains by that I cannot see.I am not at all ashamed of coming here.”"
"“而且没理由感到惭愧。”他带着鼓励的语气说，“（只要你小心）也不用担心有什么后果。”","“And have no cause to be,” says he, encouragingly.“Nor yet (if you are careful) to fear the consequences.”"
"“大人，”我说，“在您的指教下说话，我不会那么容易被吓到的。”","“My lord,” said I, “speaking under your correction, I am not very easy to be frightened.”"
"“而我肯定也不想吓唬你。”他说，“但是到了审讯的时候，我得警告你，除了回答我问你的问题，其他什么也别说。那有可能和你的安全息息相关。我有很大的决定权，这是真的，但那是有限度的。”","“And I am sure I do not seek to frighten you,” says he.“But to the interrogation; and let me warn you to volunteer nothing beyond the questions I shall ask you.It may consist very immediately with your safety.I have a great discretion, it is true, but there are bounds to it.”"
"“我会尽量遵从大人您的忠告。”我说。","“I shall try to follow your lordship’s advice,” said I."
"他在桌上铺开一张纸，写了一个标题。“顺便提一句，看来事件发生时你在现场，在莱特莫的树林里，就在枪击命案发生的那一刻，”他开始说，“这是巧合吗？”","He spread a sheet of paper on the table and wrote a heading.“It appears you were present, by the way, in the wood of Lettermore at the moment of the fatal shot,” he began.“Was this by accident?”"
"“是巧合。”我说。","“By accident,” said I."
"“你怎么会和科林·坎贝尔在交谈呢？”他问。","“How came you in speech with Colin Campbell?” he asked."
"“我在向他打听去奥查恩的路。”我回答。","“I was inquiring my way of him to Aucharn,” I replied."
"我注意到他没有记录这个回答。","I observed he did not write this answer down."
"“嗯，真的，”他说“我忘记这一点了。那么你知道吗，鲍尔弗先生？如果我是你，我就会尽可能少扯和这些斯图尔特家族的人之间的关系。最后可能会把我们的事情给搞复杂了。目前而言，我认为这些事情不是很重要。”","“H’m, true,” said he, “I had forgotten that.And do you know, Mr. Balfour, I would dwell, if I were you, as little as might be on your relations with these Stewarts.It might be found to complicate our business.I am not yet inclined to regard these matters as essential.”"
"“我本来以为，大人，在这样的案子中所有的事实都同样重要。”我说。","“I had thought, my lord, that all points of fact were equally material in such a case,” said I."
"“你忘记了我们现在正在审问这些斯图尔特人，”他颇耐人寻味地回答道，“如果我们开始审问你，情形就会大不相同了。那我就会细细盘问这些我现在情愿略过不问的问题了。再继续：我在这份芒戈·坎贝尔的预审记录里看到你立刻跑上了山坡。为什么那么做？”","“You forget we are now trying these Stewarts,” he replied, with great significance.“If we should ever come to be trying you, it will be very different; and I shall press these very questions that I am now willing to glide upon.But to resume: I have it here in Mr. Mungo Campbell’s precognition that you ran immediately up the brae.How came that?”"
"“不是立刻，大人，而是因为我看见了那个凶手。”","“Not immediately, my lord, and the cause was my seeing of the murderer.”"
"“那么，你看见他了？”","“You saw him, then?”"
"“就像我看见大人您一样清楚，尽管没有这么近。”","“As plain as I see your lordship, though not so near hand.”"
"“你认识他吗？”","“You know him?”"
"“再次碰到我应该认得出他。”","“I should know him again.”"
"“你在追赶时没有那么幸运，所以，没有追上他？”","“In your pursuit you were not so fortunate, then, as to overtake him?”"
"“我没有追上。”","“I was not.”"
"“他是独自一个人吗？”","“Was he alone?”"
"“他是独自一个人。”","“He was alone.”"
"“附近再也没有别的人了？”","“There was no one else in that neighbourhood?”"
"“艾伦·布雷克·斯图尔特离得不远，在一片小树林里。”","“Alan Breck Stewart was not far off, in a piece of a wood.”"
"检察总长放下了笔。“我觉得我们的意图有分歧，”他说，“你会发现这样只会证实你把自己耍了一把。”","The Advocate laid his pen down.“I think we are playing at cross purposes,” said he, “which you will find to prove a very ill amusement for yourself.”"
"“我满足于能听从大人您的建议，只回答所问到的问题。”我说。","“I content myself with following your lordship’s advice, and answering what I am asked,” said I."
"“要明智地及时替自己考虑考虑，”他说，“我对你最为担忧关切，而你似乎对此并不领情，那么这一切（除非你更加小心）最终可能会徒劳无益的。","“Be so wise as to bethink yourself in time,” said he, “I use you with the most anxious tenderness, which you scarce seem to appreciate, and which (unless you be more careful) may prove to be in vain.”"
"“我确实很感谢您的关爱，可是我认为那是弄错了。”我有点儿支支吾吾地回答道，因为我清楚我们终于谈及关键之处了。“我来这里是向您提供确切的信息，凭这就可以让您相信艾伦和杀害格伦努尔之事没有任何关系。”","“I do appreciate your tenderness, but conceive it to be mistaken,” I replied, with something of a falter, for I saw we were come to grips at last.“I am here to lay before you certain information, by which I shall convince you Alan had no hand whatever in the killing of Glenure.”"
"检察总长显得为难了一会儿，抿着嘴坐着，然后目光闪亮地看着我，就像一只发怒的猫。“鲍尔弗先生，”他最后说，“我要直截了当地告诉你，为你自己的利益着想，你这是走错路了。”","The Advocate appeared for a moment at a stick, sitting with pursed lips, and blinking his eyes upon me like an angry cat.“Mr. Balfour,” he said at last, “I tell you pointedly you go an ill way for your own interests.”"
"“大人，”我说，“在这件事情上，我像大人您一样没有考虑自己的利益。就算让上帝审判我，我也只有一个想法，那就是看到公平得以实现，无辜者得以洗冤。如果这种追求都会惹大人您不悦的话，我只好尽力去忍受了。”","“My lord,” I said, “I am as free of the charge of considering my own interests in this matter as your lordship.As God judges me, I have but the one design, and that is to see justice executed and the innocent go clear.If in pursuit of that I come to fall under your lordship’s displeasure, I must bear it as I may.”"
"听到这话，他从椅子上站起身来，点亮了第二根蜡烛，而且直盯着我看了一会儿。看到他神情突然变得非常严肃，我感到很惊讶，我甚至觉得他的脸色有点儿苍白。","At this he rose from his chair, lit a second candle, and for a while gazed upon me steadily.I was surprised to see a great change of gravity fallen upon his face, and I could have almost thought he was a little pale."
"“你若非头脑简单，就是思维缜密，我认为我必须跟你说说心里话了，”他说，“这是一起政治案件——唉，是的，鲍尔弗先生！不论我们是否喜欢，这起案件都是政治性的——而我一想到其中可能导致的后果就发抖。对这样的政治案件，我不必告诉你这样一位受过教育的年轻人，我们用不同观点去对待的只是一个罪犯。‘人民的利益高于一切’是最容易被滥用的，但是它却具有那种我们只能在自然法则中找到的力量——我是指它具有必然的力量。如果你允许的话，我会更加详尽地给你说明这一点。你会让我相信——”","“You are either very simple, or extremely the reverse, and I see that I must deal with you more confidentially,” says he.“This is a political case—ah, yes, Mr. Balfour! whether we like it or no, the case is political—and I tremble when I think what issues may depend from it.To a political case, I need scarce tell a young man of your education, we approach with very different thoughts from one which is criminal only.Salus populi suprema lex is a maxim susceptible of great abuse, but it has that force which we find elsewhere only in the laws of nature: I mean it has the force of necessity.I will open this out to you, if you will allow me, at more length.You would have me believe—”"
"“请您原谅，大人，我想让您相信的只是我能够证明的事情。”我说。","“Under your pardon, my lord, I would have you to believe nothing but that which I can prove,” said I."
"“啧！啧！年轻绅士，”他说，“不要这么武断，即使这些想法不幸和老鲍尔弗先生的不一致，你也要容忍一个可以做你父亲的人（如果仅仅是这样的话）用自己不尽完美的语言来表达自己可怜的想法。你要我相信布雷克是无辜的。我却认为这一点并不重要，更为重要的是我们还没有抓到我们要找的人。但是布雷克清白之说也太不靠谱了。一旦认可这一点，就会推翻我们案件中对另一个人的全部推定，那可是一个非同一般的罪犯。他是一个在叛逆中长大的人，已经两次武装反叛国王而且两次得到赦免；他是一个对现实不满的煽动者，而且（不论可能是谁曾开枪射击过）在目前谈论的这件事中具有显而易见的原始动机。你知道我指的是詹姆斯·斯图尔特吧。”","“Tut! tut; young gentleman,” says he, “be not so pragmatical, and suffer a man who might be your father (if it was nothing more) to employ his own imperfect language, and express his own poor thoughts, even when they have the misfortune not to coincide with Mr. Balfour’s.You would have me to believe Breck innocent.I would think this of little account, the more so as we cannot catch our man.But the matter of Breck’s innocence shoots beyond itself.Once admitted, it would destroy the whole presumptions of our case against another and a very different criminal; a man grown old in treason, already twice in arms against his king and already twice forgiven; a fomentor of discontent, and (whoever may have fired the shot) the unmistakable original of the deed in question.I need not tell you that I mean James Stewart.”"
"“那么我只能坦率地说，我私下到这里来跟大人您申明的正是艾伦和詹姆斯的清白无辜，而这也是我准备在审判时提供的证词。”我说。","“And I can just say plainly that the innocence of Alan and of James is what I am here to declare in private to your lordship, and what I am prepared to establish at the trial by my testimony,” said I."
"“对此我也只能同样坦率地回答，鲍尔弗先生，”他说，“（如果是那样的话）我不会叫你来提供证词，所以我希望你收回所有的话。”","“To which I can only answer by an equal plainness, Mr. Balfour,” said he, “that (in that case) your testimony will not be called by me, and I desire you to withhold it altogether.”"
"“你是这个国家的司法首领，”我叫道，“可你却建议我去犯罪！”","“You are at the head of Justice in this country,” I cried, “and you propose to me a crime!”"
"“我是用双手保护国家利益的人，”他回答道，“而我强迫你接受的是一种政治需要。爱国主义在形式上并非总是道德的。我以为你也许会对此感到高兴，因为这是在保护你自己。事实对你非常不利，我之所以还在竭力想让你脱离很危险的境地，其一是因为我当然不可能对你来这里的诚意无动于衷，其二是为了皮尔里格的信；但是最主要的原因，则是因为我认为在这件事情上首先要尽我的政治职责，其次才是司法职责。基于同样的理由——我再跟你明明白白地说一次——我不想要你的证词。”","“I am a man nursing with both hands the interests of this country,” he replied, “and I press on you a political necessity.Patriotism is not always moral in the formal sense.You might be glad of it, I think: it is your own protection; the facts are heavy against you; and if I am still trying to except you from a very dangerous place, it is in part of course because I am not insensible to your honesty in coming here; in part because of Pilrig’s letter; but in part, and in chief part, because I regard in this matter my political duty first and my judicial duty only second.For the same reason—I repeat it to you in the same frank words—I do not want your testimony.”"
"“当我在表达对我们处境的普通感受时，我希望不要被认为是在巧辩。”我说，“但是如果大人您不需要我的证词，那么我相信另一方当事人会非常高兴得到它的。”","“I desire not to be thought to make a repartee, when I express only the plain sense of our position,” said I.“But if your lordship has no need of my testimony, I believe the other side would be extremely blythe to get it.”"
"普雷斯顿格兰奇站起身，开始在房间里来回踱步。“你也不是那么小了，”他说，“所以你肯定很清楚地记得1745年以及当时给这个国家带来的打击。我在皮尔里格的信里看到你是忠诚于教会和国家的。是谁在那生死攸关的岁月里拯救了教会和国家？我不是指殿下和他立下大功的火枪队。但是在坎伯兰到德拉莫西之前，国家就已经得救了，而且战场上胜局也已经定了。是谁拯救了国家？我重复一遍，是谁拯救了新教和我们国内行政机构的整个体系？已故的法院院长卡洛登大人算是一个。他尽忠职守，却没有得到什么感谢——即使是我，你眼前所见的人，竭尽全力在尽相同的职责，寻求的并非报酬，而是我职责的良心使然。除了那位院长之外，还有谁呢？你和我一样清楚答案，部分是谣传，你自己也影射过，所以你刚进来时，我还为此责备过你。是公爵和庞大的坎贝尔家族。现在有一位坎贝尔族的人被恶意谋杀了，而且是在他为国王尽职的时候。我和公爵都是高地人。但是我们是文明的高地人，而我们的宗亲和家人中很大一部分人却并非如此。他们仍然具备野蛮人的脾性与不足。他们仍然是野蛮人，就像这些斯图尔特族人一样。只不过坎贝尔族人是站在正确一方的野蛮人，而斯图尔特族人是站在错误一方的。现在由你来裁定。坎贝尔家族的人盼望着报仇。如果他们没有抓到他——要是让詹姆斯逃跑了——那对坎贝尔家族的人就难交代了。那就意味着高地上的动乱，会造成局势的动荡不安而且很难以平息：平息就会成为一场闹剧……”","Prestongrange arose and began to pace to and fro in the room.“You are not so young,” he said, “but what you must remember very clearly the year ’45 and the shock that went about the country.I read in Pilrig’s letter that you are sound in Kirk and State.Who saved them in that fatal year?I do not refer to His Royal Highness and his ramrods, which were extremely useful in their day; but the country had been saved and the field won before ever Cumberland came upon Drummossie.Who saved it?I repeat; who saved the Protestant religion and the whole frame of our civil institutions?The late Lord President Culloden, for one; he played a man’s part, and small thanks he got for it—even as I, whom you see before you, straining every nerve in the same service, look for no reward beyond the conscience of my duties done.After the President, who else?You know the answer as well as I do; ‘tis partly a scandal, and you glanced at it yourself, and I reproved you for it, when you first came in.It was the Duke and the great clan of Campbell.Now here is a Campbell foully murdered, and that in the King’s service.The Duke and I are Highlanders.But we are Highlanders civilised, and it is not so with the great mass of our clans and families.They have still savage virtues and defects.They are still barbarians, like these Stewarts; only the Campbells were barbarians on the right side, and the Stewarts were barbarians on the wrong.Now be you the judge.The Campbells expect vengeance.If they do not get it—if this man James escape—there will be trouble with the Campbells.That means disturbance in the Highlands, which are uneasy and very far from being disarmed: the disarming is a farce...”"
"“这倒没错。”我说。","“I can bear you out in that,” said I."
"“高地上的动乱会为我们的老对手提供时机，他们一直在伺机而动，”检察总长大人一边踱着步，一边伸出一根手指继续说道，“而我向你保证我们又会出现另一个1745年，但坎贝尔家族却站在了对立面。要保护这个斯图尔特人的命——这个姓氏就算这次没有被褫夺，也已经六次因不同的罪状被褫夺过了——你打算把你的国家拖入战乱，去破坏你父辈的信念，让无数无辜的人丧失生命和财富吗？……这些都是我得认真考虑的事情。我也希望，鲍尔弗先生，作为一位热爱国家、热爱好政府、热爱宗教真理的人，你自己也要好好掂量掂量。”","“Disturbance in the Highlands makes the hour of our old watchful enemy,” pursued his lordship, holding out a finger as he paced; “and I give you my word we may have a ’45 again with the Campbells on the other side.To protect the life of this man Stewart—which is forfeit already on half-a-dozen different counts if not on this—do you propose to plunge your country in war, to jeopardise the faith of your fathers, and to expose the lives and fortunes of how many thousand innocent persons?...These are considerations that weigh with me, and that I hope will weigh no less with yourself, Mr. Balfour, as a lover of your country, good government, and religious truth.”"
"“您非常坦诚地对待我，对此我很感激，”我说，“我会尽量在我这方面做到诚实。我相信您的策略正确可靠。我相信这些重大的责任压在了大人您的身上。我相信您在要职宣誓的时候就已经把这些责任放在自己的良心上了。可是对于我，我只是一个普通男人——或者还算不上是一个男人——就必须承担普通的责任。我只会关心两件事情：一个可怜的家伙即将面临耻辱而死所带来的不公正的危险，还有就是他妻子的哭喊和眼泪仍在我的脑海中刺痛着我。我无法看得更远，大人。这是我的行事方式。如果这个国家不得不堕落，那就只好堕落了。而我会向上帝祈祷：如果这是任意妄为，他一定会及时给我启迪。”","“You deal with me very frankly, and I thank you for it,” said I.“I will try on my side to be no less honest.I believe your policy to be sound.I believe these deep duties may lie upon your lordship; I believe you may have laid them on your conscience when you took the oath of the high office which you hold.But for me, who am just a plain man—or scarce a man yet—the plain duties must suffice.I can think but of two things, of a poor soul in the immediate and unjust danger of a shameful death, and of the cries and tears of his wife that still tingle in my head.I cannot see beyond, my lord.It’s the way that I am made.If the country has to fall, it has to fall.And I pray God, if this be wilful blindness, that He may enlighten me before too late.”"
"他一动不动地听我说着，又站了好一阵子。","He had heard me motionless, and stood so a while longer."
"“这是一个意料之外的障碍。”他说，很大声，但却是对自己说的。","“This is an unexpected obstacle,” says he, aloud, but to himself."
"“那么大人您会怎么处置我呢？”我问。","“And how is your lordship to dispose of me?” I asked."
"“只要我愿意，”他说，“你知道你就有可能睡在监狱里了吗？”","“If I wished,” said he, “you know that you might sleep in gaol?”"
"“大人，”我说，“更糟糕的地方我都睡过。”","“My lord,” said I, “I have slept in worse places.”"
"“好吧，孩子，”他说，“从我们的会面来看，好像有一件事情很清楚，那就是我可以信赖你的誓言。以你的名誉保证，对今晚的事情和阿平案件之事你都会守口如瓶，那么我就会让你自由地离开。”","“Well, my boy,” said he, “there is one thing appears very plainly from our interview, that I may rely on your pledged word.Give me your honour that you will be wholly secret, not only on what has passed to-night, but in the matter of the Appin case, and I let you go free.”"
"“我保证保守秘密，直到明天或者按你所愿到最近的任何一天，”我说，“我不愿意被看成是狡猾的人，但是如果我无条件地作出了保证，大人您就如愿以偿了。”","“I will give it till to-morrow or any other near day that you may please to set,” said I.“I would not be thought too wily; but if I gave the promise without qualification your lordship would have attained his end.”"
"“我可没有想过要设圈套骗你。”他说。","“I had no thought to entrap you,” said he."
"“我确信那一点。”我说。","“I am sure of that,” said I."
"“让我看看，”他继续说道，“明天是安息日。星期一早晨八点来找我吧，向我保证在那之前你一定会严守秘密。”","“Let me see,” he continued.“To-morrow is the Sabbath.Come to me on Monday by eight in the morning, and give me our promise until then.”"
"“欣然保证，大人。”我说，“考虑到您所说的一切，我会在您有生之年遵守自己的承诺。”","“Freely given, my lord,” said I.“And with regard to what has fallen from yourself, I will give it for as long as it shall please God to spare your days.”"
"“你将会看到，”他接着说，“我没有采用任何威胁手段。”","“You will observe,” he said next, “that I have made no employment of menaces.”"
"“那才显出大人您的高贵，”我说，“而我也不是那么迟钝，我还是可以感觉到您没有说出来的那些事情的性质。”","“It was like your lordship’s nobility,” said I.“Yet I am not altogether so dull but what I can perceive the nature of those you have not uttered.”"
"“好吧，”他说，“祝你晚安。希望你睡个好觉，因为我觉得这是我最喜欢做的事了。”","“Well,” said he, “good-night to you.May you sleep well, for I think it is more than I am like to do.”"
"说这些话时，他叹息着，拿起一根蜡烛，然后把我一直送到临街大门。","With that he sighed, took up a candle, and gave me his conveyance as far as the street door."
"第五章  在检查总长的府邸","CHAPTER V—IN THE ADVOCATE’S HOUSE"
"第二天是8月27日，是一个安息日，我看到了盼望已久的场面，听到了一些爱丁堡著名传教士的布道，通过坎贝尔先生的描述，我早已经对他们很熟悉了。啊！我就好像又回到了埃森迪恩，坐着聆听可敬的坎贝尔先生本人讲道！我的思绪混乱，不断回想起和普雷斯顿格兰奇会面的情景，这使我无法全神贯注地听讲。我确实对牧师的讲道印象不太深，倒是对教堂里会众人头攒动的壮观场面印象颇深，那就像我想象中的剧院或者（按我当时的心境）审判庭一样。最重要的是，我原本指望在这座有三层走廊的西部教堂可以见到德拉蒙德小姐，结果却落得一场空。","The next day, Sabbath, August 27th, I had the occasion I had long looked forward to, to hear some of the famous Edinburgh preachers, all well known to me already by the report of Mr Campbell.Alas! and I might just as well have been at Essendean, and sitting under Mr. Campbell’s worthy self! the turmoil of my thoughts, which dwelt continually on the interview with Prestongrange, inhibiting me from all attention.I was indeed much less impressed by the reasoning of the divines than by the spectacle of the thronged congregation in the churches, like what I imagined of a theatre or (in my then disposition) of an assize of trial; above all at the West Kirk, with its three tiers of galleries, where I went in the vain hope that I might see Miss Drummond."
"星期一，我头一回去了理发店，效果令人非常满意。接着我就去了检察总长的家，在他家大门口再次出现了身着红色外套的士兵，使小巷中的这个地方很显眼。我四处寻找那位年轻的女士和她的随从，却连他们的影子都没有。有人领我进了那间小房间或是接待室，星期六我曾在那里度过一段无聊的时光。刚一进屋，我就看到了角落里詹姆斯·莫尔高大的身影。他似乎正为痛苦不安所困扰，他向前伸着他的手脚，眼睛在快速地到处转动，不停地打量这个小房间的四壁。这让我心怀同情地想起了这个人所处的悲惨境地。我想部分是因为这一点，还有部分是因为我对他女儿持续的强烈兴趣，驱使我上前与他攀谈。","On the Monday I betook me for the first time to a barber’s, and was very well pleased with the result.Thence to the Advocate’s, where the red coats of the soldiers showed again about his door, making a bright place in the close.I looked about for the young lady and her gillies: there was never a sign of them.But I was no sooner shown into the cabinet or antechamber where I had spent so wearyful a time upon the Saturday, than I was aware of the tall figure of James More in a corner.He seemed a prey to a painful uneasiness, reaching forth his feet and hands, and his eyes speeding here and there without rest about the walls of the small chamber, which recalled to me with a sense of pity the man’s wretched situation.I suppose it was partly this, and partly my strong continuing interest in his daughter, that moved me to accost him."
"“祝你早安，先生。”我说。","“Give you a good-morning, sir,” said I."
"“也祝你早安，先生。”他说。","“And a good-morning to you, sir,” said he."
"“你在等着和普雷斯顿格兰奇会面？”我问道。","“You bide tryst with Prestongrange?” I asked."
"“是的，先生。但愿你与那位绅士的会谈比我的要愉快一些。”他回答道。","“I do, sir, and I pray your business with that gentleman be more agreeable than mine,” was his reply."
"“我希望你们的会谈至少要简短一些，因为我想你会在我前面见到他。”我说。","“I hope at least that yours will be brief, for I suppose you pass before me,” said I."
"“所有的人都会在我前面，”他说着，双手向上一摊，耸了耸肩，“并非总是这样的，先生，但是时代变了。在刀光剑影的年代就不是这样的，年轻的绅士，那时只有战士的品德可以让他们支撑下去。”","“All pass before me,” he said, with a shrug and a gesture upward of the open hands.“It was not always so, sir, but times change.It was not so when the sword was in the scale, young gentleman, and the virtues of the soldier might sustain themselves.”"
"那人发出一种高地人的鼻音，这莫名其妙地就激怒了我。","There came a kind of Highland snuffle out of the man that raised my dander strangely."
"“那么，麦格雷戈先生，”我说，“我听说战士的主要品质是保持沉默，而其首要的品德就是从不抱怨。”","“Well, Mr. Macgregor,” said I, “I understand the main thing for a soldier is to be silent, and the first of his virtues never to complain.”"
"“你知道我的姓氏，我发觉”他双臂交叉向我低头致意，“虽然这是我本人不得使用的。好吧，这是公诸于众的——在面对敌人时我经常露出面容并告诉他们我的姓氏。如果我的长相和姓氏都被很多我不认识的人所熟知，我也绝不会感到奇怪。”","“You have my name, I perceive”—he bowed to me with his arms crossed—“though it’s one I must not use myself.Well, there is a publicity—I have shown my face and told my name too often in the beards of my enemies.I must not wonder if both should be known to many that I know not.”"
"“你对我可一点都不了解，先生，”我说，“其他人也一样不了解。不过我的姓名嘛，如果你想听的话，就是鲍尔弗。”","“That you know not in the least, sir,” said I, “nor yet anybody else; but the name I am called, if you care to hear it, is Balfour.”"
"“这是个好姓氏，”他礼貌地回答道，“有很多正派的人用这个姓氏。现在我想起来了，有个年轻的绅士，和你同姓，1745年在我的部队里当随军医生。”","“It is a good name,” he replied, civilly; “there are many decent folk that use it.And now that I call to mind, there was a young gentleman, your namesake, that marched surgeon in the year ’45 with my battalion.”"
"“我认为那是在贝斯的鲍尔弗的一个兄弟。”我说，因为我也想过去当外科医生。","“I believe that would be a brother to Balfour of Baith,” said I, for I was ready for the surgeon now."
"“都一样，先生。”詹姆斯·莫尔说，“既然我曾经和你的同宗是战友，你肯定会允许我和你握握手了。”","“The same, sir,” said James More.“And since I have been fellow-soldier with your kinsman, you must suffer me to grasp your hand.”"
"他温和地和我握了很久的手，满面笑容地看了我一会儿，就好像他找到了一位兄弟一样。","He shook hands with me long and tenderly, beaming on me the while as though he had found a brother."
"“啊！”他说，“时日已经发生变化了，当时我和你堂兄的耳边尽听到子弹的呼啸声。”","“Ah!” says he, “these are changed days since your cousin and I heard the balls whistle in our lugs.”"
"“我认为他只是我的一位远房亲戚，”我冷淡地说，“而且我得说我跟那个人从未谋面。”","“I think he was a very far-away cousin,” said I, drily, “and I ought to tell you that I never clapped eyes upon the man.”"
"“唔，唔，”他说，“那没有什么不同。而你——我觉得你是不常出门的，先生——我不太记得你的长相，可是你的长相是不太可能叫人忘记的。”","“Well, well,” said he, “it makes no change.And you—I do not think you were out yourself, sir—I have no clear mind of your face, which is one not probable to be forgotten.”"
"“在你提到的那一年，麦格雷戈先生，我还在教区的学校里挨巴掌呢。”我说。","“In the year you refer to, Mr. Macgregor, I was getting skelped in the parish school,” said I."
"“那么小！”他叫道，“唉，那么，你永远也不可能想到这次会面对我意味着什么了。在我处于逆境的时刻，在这里，在我的敌人的家里，居然碰到一个有老战友血统的人——这让我心潮澎湃，鲍尔弗先生，就像看到了高地的风笛套！先生，这可是我们很多人不得不回忆的悲伤往事，有些人想起就会落泪。我曾经像国王一样生活在自己的故乡，那里有我的剑，我的山，还有来自朋友及族人的源源不绝的信任。而现在我却躺在臭气熏熏的地牢里。你知道吗，鲍尔弗先生？”他继续说，抓着我的手臂而且开始拽着我四处走动，“先生，你知道我连起码的必需品都缺乏吗？我的敌人恶意谋划，没收了我的所有财产。正如你所知道的，先生，我面临着一桩莫须有的指控，而我像你一样清白无辜。他们不敢带我上法庭，与此同时我在监狱里却无法自保。我本希望遇到的是你的堂兄，或者是他的兄弟贝斯本人。他们任何一个，我知道，都会非常乐意帮助我。然而像你这么一位如此陌生的人——”","“So young!” cries he.“Ah, then, you will never be able to think what this meeting is to me.In the hour of my adversity, and here in the house of my enemy, to meet in with the blood of an old brother-in-arms—it heartens me, Mr. Balfour, like the skirting of the highland pipes!Sir, this is a sad look back that many of us have to make: some with falling tears.I have lived in my own country like a king; my sword, my mountains, and the faith of my friends and kinsmen sufficed for me.Now I lie in a stinking dungeon; and do you know, Mr. Balfour,” he went on, taking my arm and beginning to lead me about, “do you know, sir, that I lack mere necessaries?The malice of my foes has quite sequestered my resources.I lie, as you know, sir, on a trumped-up charge, of which I am as innocent as yourself.They dare not bring me to my trial, and in the meanwhile I am held naked in my prison.I could have wished it was your cousin I had met, or his brother Baith himself.Either would, I know, have been rejoiced to help me; while a comparative stranger like yourself—”"
"他用乞求的口吻一股脑儿地向我倾诉，我不好意思打断他，或是对他作出简短、敷衍的回答。有几次我很想说点别的话让他住口的，然而不知是出于不好意思还是出于骄傲——是为了我自己还是看在卡特里奥娜的份上——也不知是因为我觉得他不配当他女儿的父亲，或是因为我讨厌他为人粗劣、满身透着虚伪——我实在是做不出这种事。而我仍然在听其哄骗和说教，同时还被拽着来回迈步，在那狭小的房间里，走三步就得转个身。我非常简短地回答过几次，内心已经很生气了，尽管到最后都还没有阻止住我那位乞丐的话。这时普雷斯顿格兰奇出现在门口，急切地吩咐我去他的大会客室。","I would be ashamed to set down all he poured out to me in this beggarly vein, or the very short and grudging answers that I made to him.There were times when I was tempted to stop his mouth with some small change; but whether it was from shame or pride—whether it was for my own sake or Catriona’s—whether it was because I thought him no fit father for his daughter, or because I resented that grossness of immediate falsity that clung about the man himself—the thing was clean beyond me.And I was still being wheedled and preached to, and still being marched to and fro, three steps and a turn, in that small chamber, and had already, by some very short replies, highly incensed, although not finally discouraged, my beggar, when Prestongrange appeared in the doorway and bade me eagerly into his big chamber."
"“我此刻还有事在身，”他说，“但我不能让你干坐着。我要带你去见我的三个漂亮女儿，你可能已经听说过她们，因为我认为她们比我这个爸爸更有名。这边走。”","“I have a moment’s engagements,” said he; “and that you may not sit empty-handed I am going to present you to my three braw daughters, of whom perhaps you may have heard, for I think they are more famous than papa.This way.”"
"他带我走进楼上的一间长形房间，里面有一个干瘪的老太太坐在刺绣架前，还有三个身着苏格兰服装的很漂亮的年轻女子（我猜想）一起站在一扇窗户边。","He led me into another long room above, where a dry old lady sat at a frame of embroidery, and the three handsomest young women (I suppose) in Scotland stood together by a window."
"“这是我的新朋友，鲍尔弗先生，”他拉着我的手臂介绍说，“戴维，这是我的姐姐格兰特小姐，她在帮我照管房子。如果能帮助你的话，她会非常高兴的。而这里，”他说着，转向那三位年轻的女士，“这就是我的三位漂亮女儿。戴维先生，坦率回答一个问题：她们三个人中哪一位最受宠爱？我打赌他绝不会那么轻率，作出像诚实的艾伦·拉姆齐那样的回答！”","“This is my new friend, Mr Balfour,” said he, presenting me by the arm, “David, here is my sister, Miss Grant, who is so good as keep my house for me, and will be very pleased if she can help you.And here,” says he, turning to the three younger ladies, “here are my three braw dauchters.A fair question to ye, Mr. Davie: which of the three is the best favoured?And I wager he will never have the impudence to propound honest Alan Ramsay’s answer!”"
"这时三位姑娘，还有老小姐格兰特，全都大叫着抗议这句俏皮话。这（由于我对他所提及的诗句很熟悉）也让我满脸窘色。在我看来，一位父亲引用这样的话好像不太合适，而我感到惊讶的是：这些女士就算在责怪时都还在大笑，或者她们只是在假装责怪。","Hereupon all three, and the old Miss Grant as well, cried out against this sally, which (as I was acquainted with the verses he referred to) brought shame into my own check.It seemed to me a citation unpardonable in a father, and I was amazed that these ladies could laugh even while they reproved, or made believe to."
"在这种欢笑声中，普雷斯顿格兰奇走出了房间，而我被留了下来。呆在那种很不适合的圈子里，我就像旱地上的鱼一样很不自在。回忆起接着发生的事，我不能否认我当时愚蠢之极。而我不得不承认那些女士都极有教养，才能对我保持那么久的耐心。其实，那位姑妈还坐在她的刺绣品前，只是不时微笑着看看我们。但是这些姑娘们，尤其是年龄最大的、也是最漂亮的那一位，对我多有关注，而我却很不懂如何回应。我告诉自己，我是一个既有些身价又有一份好财产的年轻人，没有必要在这些少女面前感到害臊。她们中最大的都还没有我大，而且她们中没有一个人可能有我一半的学问。但这一切都是徒劳。理性并没有改变事实。有好几次，一想到那天我还是第一次刮脸，我的脸就红了。","Under cover of this mirth, Prestongrange got forth of the chamber, and I was left, like a fish upon dry land, in that very unsuitable society.I could never deny, in looking back upon what followed, that I was eminently stockish; and I must say the ladies were well drilled to have so long a patience with me.The aunt indeed sat close at her embroidery, only looking now and again and smiling; but the misses, and especially the eldest, who was besides the most handsome, paid me a score of attentions which I was very ill able to repay.It was all in vain to tell myself  I was a young fellow of some worth as well as a good estate, and had no call to feel abashed before these lasses, the eldest not so much older than myself, and no one of them by any probability half as learned.Reasoning would not change the fact; and there were times when the colour came into my face to think I was shaved that day for the first time."
"虽然她们都已经竭尽全力，谈话还是进行得很吃力。年龄最大的那位体谅我的为难之处，就在她精于演奏的乐器前坐了下来，为我边弹边唱，乐曲和歌声都带有苏格兰和意大利的风格。这让我感觉自在一些了，因为想起了艾伦在卡里顿附近的山洞里曾教我的曲调，我就大胆地吹了一两节口哨，还问她是否知道那支曲子。","The talk going, with all their endeavours, very heavily, the eldest took pity on my awkwardness, sat down to her instrument, of which she was a passed mistress, and entertained me for a while with playing and singing, both in the Scots and in the Italian manners; this put me more at my ease, and being reminded of Alan’s air that he had taught me in the hole near Carriden, I made so bold as to whistle a bar or two, and ask if she knew that."
"她摇了摇头。“我从来没有听过这支曲子，”她说，“把它从头到尾吹完。现在再吹一遍。”我吹完一遍后，她又补充道。","She shook her head.“I never heard a note of it,” said she.“Whistle it all through.And now once again,” she added, after I had done so."
"接着她在键盘上把它弹奏了出来，而且（让我惊讶的是）配了优美的和弦，立刻使那曲调更加丰满了。她一边弹还一边唱着，表情夸张逗趣而且带着浓重的乡音——","Then she picked it out upon the keyboard, and (to my surprise) instantly enriched the same with well-sounding chords, and sang, as she played, with a very droll expression and broad accent—"
"“难道我没有抓准这轻快的旋律吗？难道这不是你吹过的曲调吗？”","“Haenae I got just the lilt of it?Isnae this the tune that ye whustled?”"
"“你看，”她说，“我也能作诗了，只不过不押韵罢了。”接着她又开始唱道：","“You see,” she says, “I can do the poetry too, only it won’t rhyme.And then again:"
"“我是格兰特小姐，检察总长的亲女儿。你，我相信，就是戴维·鲍尔弗。”","“I am Miss Grant, sib to the Advocate:You, I believe, are Dauvit Balfour.”"
"我告诉她我对她的天赋感到非常惊讶。","I told her how much astonished I was by her genius."
"“那这首曲子叫什么？”她问道。","“And what do you call the name of it?” she asked."
"“我还不知道它的真实曲名，”我说，“我只是称之为艾伦的曲调。”","“I do not know the real name,” said I.“I just call it Alan’s air.”"
"她直视着我的脸。“我要把它称作戴维的曲调，”她说，“不过用你的名字命名的这首乐曲，若是让以色列人弹给扫罗王听则会截然不同。国王听这首曲子是得不到什么益处的，对此我绝不会觉得奇怪，因为这只不过是忧郁的乐曲罢了。我不喜欢你取的那个名字，所以你要是还想再次听到你这首曲调，就得按我取的名字称呼它。”","She looked at me directly in the face.“I shall call it David’s air,” said she; “though if it’s the least like what your namesake of Israel played to Saul I would never wonder that the king got little good by it, for it’s but melancholy music.Your other name I do not like; so if you was ever wishing to hear your tune again you are to ask for it by mine.”"
"这番话说来意味深长，让我不由怦然心动。“格兰特小姐，此话怎讲？”我问。","This was said with a significance that gave my heart a jog.“Why that, Miss Grant?” I asked."
"“啊，”她说，“万一你将来受绞刑的话，我就把你的临终遗言和忏悔谱上那个曲调拿来吟唱。”","“Why,” says she, “if ever you should come to get hanged, I will set your last dying speech and confession to that tune and sing it.”"
"这番话无疑说明了她对我的事情和危险已经多少有所知晓。是怎样得知的，或者知道多少，这就很难猜到了。显然她知道艾伦的名字里含有某种危险，所以提醒我不要提起。显然她也知道我正被怀疑犯有某种罪行。此外，我还断定她最后的严厉言辞（而且紧跟着她弹了一段非常嘈杂的音乐）是为了结束当时的谈话。我站在她身旁，装出一副在聆听和欣赏的样子，其实我的思绪早已游离。我一直就发现这位女士喜欢故弄玄虚，当然这头一回见面所给的谜团就已经让我如坠云雾之中。有一件事，我过了很久才知道。那个星期天的时间他们利用得相当充分：找到并盘问了那个银行杂役，发现我拜访查尔斯·斯图尔特之事，还推断出我与詹姆斯和艾伦交往颇深，极有可能还在和艾伦联系。因此就通过这架古钢琴给了我明显的暗示。","This put it beyond a doubt that she was partly informed of my story and peril.How, or just how much, it was more difficult to guess.It was plain she knew there was something of danger in the name of Alan, and thus warned me to leave it out of reference; and plain she knew that I stood under some criminal suspicion.I judged besides that the harshness of her last speech (which besides she had followed up immediately with a very noisy piece of music) was to put an end to the present conversation.I stood beside her, affecting to listen and admire, but truly whirled away by my own thoughts.I have always found this young lady to be a lover of the mysterious; and certainly this first interview made a mystery that was beyond my plummet.One thing I learned long after, the hours of the Sunday had been well employed, the bank porter had been found and examined, my visit to Charles Stewart was discovered, and the deduction made that I was pretty deep with James and Alan, and most likely in a continued correspondence with the last.Hence this broad hint that was given me across the harpsichord."
"在弹奏这段音乐时，其中一位年轻一些的女孩站在小巷子上方的那扇窗户边，她突然叫喊着让她的姐姐们快过来，因为“那双灰眼睛又来了”。全家人马上聚拢过去，互相挤着想看一眼。她们跑过去的那扇窗户在房间偏僻的角落里，正在大门入口处的上方，小巷子的斜上方。","In the midst of the piece of music, one of the younger misses, who was at a window over the close, cried on her sisters to come quick, for there was “Grey eyes again.”The whole family trooped there at once, and crowded one another for a look.The window whither they ran was in an odd corner of that room, gave above the entrance door, and flanked up the close."
"“过来，鲍尔弗先生，”她们喊着，“过来看呀。她可是最美丽的尤物！最近这些天来，她总是在小巷的尽头徘徊，身边跟着一些样子很可怜的随从。不过她的样子还真像是一位淑女。”","“Come, Mr. Balfour,” they cried, “come and see.She is the most beautiful creature!She hangs round the close-head these last days, always with some wretched-like gillies, and yet seems quite a lady.”"
"我其实并不需要去看，所以我既没有看第二眼，也没看很长时间。我担心她可能已经看到我在那里，正从一间传出音乐的房间往下看她。她却在外面，她父亲也在同一栋房子里，也许正在眼泪巴巴地乞求活命，而我刚刚才拒绝了他的请求走过来的。但是甚至只是那么一瞥就使我立刻自负起来，不再那么敬畏那些年轻的小姐了。她们很美，那是不容置疑的，但是卡特里奥娜也很美，而且她身上有种光彩，就像燃烧的火焰。其他人让我有多沮丧，她就会让我有多振奋。我回想起曾经和她轻松交谈过。如果说和这些漂亮姑娘在一起，我没能把握好机会的话，那也许或多或少是她们自己的过错吧。我内心的尴尬开始夹杂着丝丝开心，心情愉悦了起来。因此当姑妈在刺绣品前对我微笑时，当三位姑娘对我像对待孩子般那么亲近随和，而脸上却都显出了是“爸爸的吩咐”时，好几次我发现自己都是发自内心地微笑了。","I had no need to look; neither did I look twice, or long.I was afraid she might have seen me there, looking down upon her from that chamber of music, and she without, and her father in the same house, perhaps begging for his life with tears, and myself come but newly from rejecting his petitions.But even that glance set me in a better conceit of myself and much less awe of the young ladies.They were beautiful, that was beyond question, but Catriona was beautiful too, and had a kind of brightness in her like a coal of fire.As much as the others cast me down, she lifted me up.I remembered I had talked easily with her.If I could make no hand of it with these fine maids, it was perhaps something their own fault.My embarrassment began to be a little mingled and lightened with a sense of fun; and when the aunt smiled at me from her embroidery, and the three daughters unbent to me like a baby, all with “papa’s orders” written on their faces, there were times when I could have found it in my heart to smile myself."
"不一会儿爸爸回来了，还是那么和蔼、幸福、说话中听。","Presently papa returned, the same kind, happy-like, pleasant-spoken man."
"“好了，女儿们，”他说，“我必须再次带鲍尔弗先生离开了。我希望你们已经劝服他了，他还是会回到我很容易找到他的那个地方。”","“Now, girls,” said he, “I must take Mr. Balfour away again; but I hope you have been able to persuade him to return where I shall be always gratified to find him.”"
"于是她们每个人都向我问候了一句，接着他就带我离开了。","So they each made me a little farthing compliment, and I was led away."
"如果此次对这个家庭的拜访是打算让我放松戒备的话，那可是再失败不过了。我没那么笨，我清楚我当时有多可怜，我清楚只要我僵硬着背一转过身去，那些姑娘们就会张大了嘴在打哈欠。我感觉我当时既没有表现出自身温柔的一面，也没有表现出应该有的优雅。我渴望有机会来证明我还有些其他的品质，在面对严峻的形势和危险的情形时。","If this visit to the family had been meant to soften my resistance, it was the worst of failures.I was no such ass but what I understood how poor a figure I had made, and that the girls would be yawning their jaws off as soon as my stiff back was turned.I felt I had shown how little I had in me of what was soft and graceful; and I longed for a chance to prove that I had something of the other stuff, the stern and dangerous."
"那么，我将会遵从自己的意愿，因为他要带我去的那种场合性质完全不一样了。","Well, I was to be served to my desire, for the scene to which he was conducting me was of a different character."
"第六章  前洛瓦特勋爵","CHAPTER VI—UMQUILE THE MASTER OF LOVAT"
"在普雷斯顿格兰奇的书房里有一个男人在等着我们。看到他的第一眼我就很讨厌他，就像我们很讨厌密探或者偷听者一样。他长相奇丑，却显得很像一位绅士；他举止平和，但也会突然暴跳如雷；他声音轻细，但只要他愿意就会发出尖锐刺耳的恐怖声音。","There was a man waiting us in Prestongrange’s study, whom I distasted at the first look, as we distaste a ferret or an earwig.He was bitter ugly, but seemed very much of a gentleman; had still manners, but capable of sudden leaps and violences; and a small voice, which could ring out shrill and dangerous when he so desired."
"检察总长亲切友好地为我们做了介绍。","The Advocate presented us in a familiar, friendly way."
"“喂，弗雷泽，”他说，“这就是我们曾谈论过的鲍尔弗先生。戴维先生，这是西蒙·弗雷泽先生，我们过去称呼他另一个头衔，可那是老皇历了。弗雷泽先生有一件事情要找你。”","“Here, Fraser,” said he, “here is Mr. Balfour whom we talked about.Mr. David, this is Mr. Simon Fraser, whom we used to call by another title, but that is an old song.Mr. Fraser has an errand to you.”"
"说完这句话，他就走向一旁的书架，远远地在那一端假装查阅一册四开本的书。","With that he stepped aside to his book-shelves, and made believe to consult a quarto volume in the far end."
"我就这样被留了下来，（在某种意义上）单独和这个也许是这世上我最不愿意见到的人呆在一起了。根据介绍已然明白无疑，这人正是被褫夺了爵位的洛瓦特勋爵，也是庞大的弗雷泽家族的首领。我知道他曾带领他的人马叛乱，也知道他的父亲——那位老勋爵、山里的灰狐狸——已经因谋反而命丧断头台，他家族的土地已经被没收，而且他们的贵族身份也已经被剥夺。我想不明白他在格兰特的家里干什么。我也想象不出他已经放弃过去所有的原则，还得以进入了法律界，现在居然因为向政府献媚甚至当上了处理阿平凶杀案的副检察长。","I was thus left (in a sense) alone with perhaps the last person in the world I had expected.There was no doubt upon the terms of introduction; this could be no other than the forfeited Master of Lovat and chief of the great clan Fraser.I knew he had led his men in the Rebellion; I knew his father’s head—my old lord’s, that grey fox of the mountains—to have fallen on the block for that offence, the lands of the family to have been seized, and their nobility attainted.I could not conceive what he should be doing in Grant’s house; I could not conceive that he had been called to the bar, had eaten all his principles, and was now currying favour with the Government even to the extent of acting Advocate-Depute in the Appin murder."
"“好了，鲍尔弗先生，”他说，“我会从你这里听到什么呢？”","“Well, Mr. Balfour,” said he, “what is all this I hear of ye?”"
"“不应该由我预先作出判断，”我说，“但是如果你是根据检察总长的观点得出的认识，那么他是完全了解我的看法的。”","“It would not become me to prejudge,” said I, “but if the Advocate was your authority he is fully possessed of my opinions.”"
"“我可以告诉你，我在参与处理阿平的案子，”他继续说，“普雷斯顿格兰奇是我的上司，通过我对预审材料的研究，我可以肯定地跟你说你的看法是错误的。布雷克的罪行昭然若揭，而你的证言，就是你承认说案发那一刻你在山上看见过他，只会证明他应该判绞刑。”","“I may tell you I am engaged in the Appin case,” he went on; “I am to appear under Prestongrange; and from my study of the precognitions I can assure you your opinions are erroneous.The guilt of Breck is manifest; and your testimony, in which you admit you saw him on the hill at the very moment, will certify his hanging.”"
"“在你抓到他之前就说判他绞刑，那不恰当吧，”我说，“而对于其他的事情，我倒非常想听听你自己的意见。”","“It will be rather ill to hang him till you catch him,” I observed.“And for other matters I very willingly leave you to your own impressions.”"
"“公爵已经得到消息了，”他继续说，“我刚从公爵大人那里过来，他非常真诚直率地当面向我表达了他自己的看法，真不愧是一位大贵族。他提到了你的名字，鲍尔弗先生，而且预先向你表示感谢，只要你愿意接受那些人的指引，他们那些人对你和国家的利益的了解可比你清楚得多了。感谢绝不只是口头上说说而已：相信我，我是过来人。我猜想，对于我的名字和宗族，对于那该死的惩罚和先父令人遗憾的结局，你应该已经有所了解，更不用说我自己的过错了。好了，我已经和那位善良的公爵大人讲和，他已经通过我们的朋友普雷斯顿格兰奇让我参与诉讼了。现在我的脚又蹬在了马镫里，有份起诉乔治国王的敌人，并且要去讨伐那些最近大胆公然侮辱国王陛下的人。”","“The Duke has been informed,” he went on.“I have just come from his Grace, and he expressed himself before me with an honest freedom like the great nobleman he is.He spoke of you by name, Mr. Balfour, and declared his gratitude beforehand in case you would be led by those who understand your own interests and those of the country so much better than yourself.Gratitude is no empty expression in that mouth: experto-crede.I daresay you know something of my name and clan, and the damnable example and lamented end of my late father, to say nothing of my own errata.Well, I have made my peace with that good Duke; he has intervened for me with our friend Prestongrange; and here I am with my foot in the stirrup again and some of the responsibility shared into my hand of prosecuting King George’s enemies and avenging the late daring and barefaced insult to his Majesty.”"
"“你确实不愧为你父亲值得骄傲的儿子。”我说。","“Doubtless a proud position for your father’s son,” says I."
"他冲着我扬了扬他那光秃秃的眉毛。“我觉得，你很喜欢做一些讽刺人的尝试，”他说，“但是我现在有任务在身，我是出于正确的信念来办事的，你想转变我也是枉然。让我告诉你吧，像你这样有热情、有雄心的年轻小伙子，一开始有人扶一把会胜过十年的艰辛努力。现在是否需要帮扶由你决定，如果作出有利于你上进的选择，公爵将会用父亲般的慈爱呵护你。”","He wagged his bald eyebrows at me.“You are pleased to make experiments in the ironical, I think,” said he.“But I am here upon duty, I am here to discharge my errand in good faith, it is in vain you think to divert me.And let me tell you, for a young fellow of spirit and ambition like yourself, a good shove in the beginning will do more than ten years’ drudgery.The shove is now at your command; choose what you will to be advanced in, the Duke will watch upon you with the affectionate disposition of a father.”"
"“我在想我缺乏做儿子的那种顺从。”我说。","“I am thinking that I lack the docility of the son,” says I."
"“先生，你还真以为，这个国家的整个政策会因为一个举止鲁莽又没有经验的小毛孩而出错并发生动摇吗？”他叫喊道，“这已经成为一种通例，凡是想有所成就的人都必须奋力拼搏。看着我！难道你以为我喜欢去起诉一个和我并肩作战过的人，让自己处于招人怨恨的境地吗？我没有选择的余地。”","“And do you really suppose, sir, that the whole policy of this country is to be suffered to trip up and tumble down for an ill-mannered colt of a boy?” he cried.“This has been made a test case, all who would prosper in the future must put a shoulder to the wheel.Look at me!Do you suppose it is for my pleasure that I put myself in the highly invidious position of persecuting a man that I have drawn the sword alongside of?The choice is not left me.”"
"“但是我认为，先生，在你卷入那些残忍的叛乱时，你就已经丧失自己的选择权了，”我评论说，“很庆幸，我的案子完全不同。我是一个诚实的人，可以坦然无惧地面对公爵或是乔治国王。”","“But I think, sir, that you forfeited your choice when you mixed in with that unnatural rebellion,” I remarked.“My case is happily otherwise; I am a true man, and can look either the Duke or King George in the face without concern.”"
"“情况果真如此吗？”他说，“我断言你犯了最糟糕的错误。普雷斯顿格兰奇一直对你礼貌有加（他告诉我的），尽量不和你的陈述正面冲突。但是你不能不想到他是带着强烈的怀疑态度来看待你的辩解的。你说你是无辜的。我亲爱的先生，事实却证明你有罪。”","“Is it so the wind sits?” says he.“I protest you are fallen in the worst sort of error.Prestongrange has been hitherto so civil (he tells me) as not to combat your allegations; but you must not think they are not looked upon with strong suspicion.You say you are innocent.My dear sir, the facts declare you guilty.”"
"“我就知道你会这么说。”我说。","“I was waiting for you there,” said I."
"“芒戈·坎贝尔的证据，你在完成谋杀后的逃跑，你的漫长而秘密的逃跑路线——我可爱的年轻人！”西蒙先生说，“这里有足够的证据去绞死一头小公牛，更不用说戴维·鲍尔弗了！我将出席那场审判，我会高高扬起声音，我会说很多和今天截然不同的话，当然会令你极不满意，不会像你现在愿意听的这样！啊，你的脸色发白了！”他说，“我戳中你鲁莽冒失之心的要害了。你看起来脸色苍白，你的眼神摇摆不定了，戴维先生！你看见了坟墓，看见那绞刑架比你想象的还要近。”","“The evidence of Mungo Campbell; your flight after the completion of the murder; your long course of secresy—my good young man!” said Mr. Simon, “here is enough evidence to hang a bullock, let be a David Balfour!I shall be upon that trial; my voice shall be raised; I shall then speak much otherwise from what I do to-day, and far less to your gratification, little as you like it now!Ah, you look white!” cries he.“I have found the key of your impudent heart.You look pale, your eyes waver, Mr. David!You see the grave and the gallows nearer by than you had fancied.”"
"“我承认自己有常人的弱点，”我说，“我不为此感到羞耻。羞耻……”我继续说着。","“I own to a natural weakness,” said I.“I think no shame for that.Shame...”I was going on."
"“羞耻会在绞刑架上等着你。”他插进来说。","“Shame waits for you on the gibbet,” he broke in."
"“在那里我将和勋爵大人——你的父亲扯平了。”我说。","“Where I shall but be even’d with my lord your father,” said I."
"“啊哈，但不是那样的！”他叫道，“你还没有看清这件事情的本质。我父亲是在一项伟大的事业中蒙难，他当时是在参与王室之争。你却是为一桩一文不值的卑鄙谋杀案而被绞死。你亲自参与其中，成为叛乱分子之一，还在这里为那帮可悲的家伙狡辩，你的同伙只是一群衣衫褴褛的高地侍从。而且能够看得出来，我了不起的鲍尔弗先生——能够看得出来，也将会看到，相信我，那是多管闲事——能够看得出来，也应该看得到，你是被收买而参与此事的。我想我可以看到我举证以后法庭上人们的神色，证据会显示出：你，一个受过教育的年轻人，居然为了一套可以扔掉的破衣服、一瓶高地烈酒，还有三十五个半便士的铜币就自甘堕落参与了这起骇人听闻的事件。”","“Aha, but not so!” he cried, “and you do not yet see to the bottom of this business.My father suffered in a great cause, and for dealing in the affairs of kings.You are to hang for a dirty murder about boddle-pieces.Your personal part in it, the treacherous one of holding the poor wretch in talk, your accomplices a pack of ragged Highland gillies.And it can be shown, my great Mr. Balfour—it can be shown, and it will be shown, trust me that has a finger in the pie—it can be shown, and shall be shown, that you were paid to do it.I think I can see the looks go round the court when I adduce my evidence, and it shall appear that you, a young man of education, let yourself be corrupted to this shocking act for a suit of cast clothes, a bottle of Highland spirits, and three-and-fivepence-halfpenny in copper money.”"
"这些话所触及的事实给了我当头一棒：衣服、一瓶法国白兰地，还有三十五个半便士的零钱凑在一起，确实，这些东西大多是我和艾伦从奥查恩带过来的。我明白了是有些詹姆斯的人在受关押的地牢里招供了。","There was a touch of the truth in these words that knocked me like a blow: clothes, a bottle of usquebaugh, and three-and-fivepence-halfpenny in change made up, indeed, the most of what Alan and I had carried from Auchurn; and I saw that some of James’s people had been blabbing in their dungeons."
"“你看，我知道的比你想象的还多吧，”他得意洋洋地继续说道，“而至于说留一个回旋的余地，了不起的戴维先生，你千万别指望大不列颠和爱尔兰政府会因为缺乏证据而束手无策。我们牢里关的人，有的是那种为了活命愿意发誓按照我们的指点去做的人。按我的指点，如果你更喜欢这种说法的话。所以你现在可以猜想得到，如果你选择去死，你所得到的到底是什么荣耀。一方面，是生命、美酒、女人，还有一个公爵做你的保护伞；另一方面，是绳索套颈、绞架锁骨，还有一个污秽低俗的故事会流传到将来，那是关于一个与你同名的受雇刺客的故事。那么看看这里！”他以一种气势汹汹的尖利声音叫道，“看看我从口袋里拿出的这张纸吧。看看那上面的名字，我相信，这正是了不起的戴维的名字，墨迹都还未干呢。你猜得出这是张什么纸吗？这是你的逮捕令，我只要碰一下身边这个铃就可以当场执行逮捕。一旦根据这张纸抓你进了牢狱，但愿上帝能帮你吧，因为一切就成定局了！”","“You see I know more than you fancied,” he resumed in triumph.“And as for giving it this turn, great Mr. David, you must not suppose the Government of Great Britain and Ireland will ever be stuck for want of evidence.We have men here in prison who will swear out their lives as we direct them; as I direct, if you prefer the phrase.So now you are to guess your part of glory if you choose to die.On the one hand, life, wine, women, and a duke to be your handgun: on the other, a rope to your craig, and a gibbet to clatter your bones on, and the lousiest, lowest story to hand down to your namesakes in the future that was ever told about a hired assassin.And see here!” he cried, with a formidable shrill voice, “see this paper that I pull out of my pocket.Look at the name there: it is the name of the great David, I believe, the ink scarce dry yet.Can you guess its nature?It is the warrant for your arrest, which I have but to touch this bell beside me to have executed on the spot.Once in the Tolbooth upon this paper, may God help you, for the die is cast!”"
"我无法否认我因为极度的卑贱而感到非常恐惧，而且因为所面临危险的紧迫和险恶而深感怯懦。西蒙先生见我脸色大变，早已经是得意非凡。我毫不怀疑此时我的脸色绝不比我的衬衫红，我的言语也已经颤抖难禁。","I must never deny that I was greatly horrified by so much baseness, and much unmanned by the immediacy and ugliness of my danger.Mr. Simon had already gloried in the changes of my hue; I make no doubt I was now no ruddier than my shirt; my speech besides trembled."
"“这间房里有一位绅士，”我叫道，“我可以向他求助。我把自己的生命和信誉都交到他的手里了。”","“There is a gentleman in this room,” cried I.“I appeal to him.I put my life and credit in his hands.”"
"普雷斯顿格兰奇“啪”地一下合上了书。“我告诉过你的，西蒙，”他说，“你已经耍尽了一切手段，可是你输了。戴维先生，”他继续说道，“我希望你相信我也是迫不得已才让你接受这个考验的。我希望你能明白，你能如此令人满意地经受住这场考验，对此我很高兴。也许你还不大清楚是怎么回事，但这却是本人应尽的一点职责。因为要是我们这位朋友比我昨天晚上更加成功的话，也许就显出他是一位比我更胜一筹的法官，也许还显示出我们——西蒙先生和我自己，都估错了形势。而我知道我们的朋友西蒙是很有抱负的。”他说，同时轻轻地拍着弗雷泽的肩膀，“至于这场舞台戏，已经结束了。我在感情上是很向着你的，但凡我们在这件不幸的事件中发现的问题，我都会当成自己的事，注意用最温和的方式对待你。”","Prestongrange shut his book with a snap.“I told you so, Simon,” said he; “you have played your hand for all it was worth, and you have lost.Mr. David,” he went on, “I wish you to believe it was by no choice of mine you were subjected to this proof.I wish you could understand how glad I am you should come forth from it with so much credit.You may not quite see how, but it is a little of a service to myself.For had our friend here been more successful than I was last night, it might have appeared that he was a better judge of men than I; it might have appeared we were altogether in the wrong situations, Mr. Simon and myself.And I know our friend Simon to be ambitious,” says he, striking lightly on Fraser’s shoulder.“As for this stage play, it is over; my sentiments are very much engaged in your behalf; and whatever issue we can find to this unfortunate affair, I shall make it my business to see it is adopted with tenderness to you.”"
"这些话说得很好，而我却从中看不出什么关爱，也许在这两个反对我的家伙之间倒有那么一点真正的恶意。所有这一切再清楚不过了，这场面谈是早就设计好的，说不定两人还一起排练过。显然我的对手认真地用尽各种办法来试探我。而现在（说服、奉承和威胁都已经尝试过，却是枉然）我不由地在想他们下一步又会施展什么伎俩。此外，由于刚刚的折磨所带来的痛苦，我的眼神仍然慌乱不安，膝盖发软无力，只能结结巴巴地说着同样的话：“我把我的性命和信誉都交到你的手里了。”","These were very good words, and I could see besides that there was little love, and perhaps a spice of genuine ill-will, between these two who were opposed to me.For all that, it was unmistakable this interview had been designed, perhaps rehearsed, with the consent of both; it was plain my adversaries were in earnest to try me by all methods; and now (persuasion, flattery, and menaces having been tried in vain) I could not but wonder what would be their next expedient.My eyes besides were still troubled, and my knees loose under me, with the distress of the late ordeal; and I could do no more than stammer the same form of words: “I put my life and credit in your hands.”"
"“好，好，”他说，“我们必须设法救他们。现在让我们回到更温和的方法上来。你千万不要对我的朋友西蒙先生心存芥蒂，他只是公事公办罢了。就算你对我确实心怀怨恨，其实我只不过站在一边，似乎更像一个帮忙的人，我也不准你把这种怨恨扩展到我无辜的家人身上。这些安排只为了更好地了解你，而我绝不允许有人让我家的那些年轻女孩失望。明天她们要去霍普公园，我觉得你到那里去跟大家正式见个面比较合适。先来找我，我可能有一些事情想跟你私下交流。然后由我的女儿们再带你出门。在那之前，你要再次向我承诺一直保守秘密。”","“Well, well,” said he, “we must try to save them.And in the meanwhile let us return to gentler methods.You must not bear any grudge upon my friend, Mr. Simon, who did but speak by his brief.And even if you did conceive some malice against myself, who stood by and seemed rather to hold a candle, I must not let that extend to innocent members of my family.These are greatly engaged to see more of you, and I cannot consent to have my young womenfolk disappointed.To-morrow they will be going to Hope Park, where I think it very proper you should make your bow.Call for me first, when I may possibly have something for your private hearing; then you shall be turned abroad again under the conduct of my misses; and until that time repeat to me your promise of secrecy.”"
"本来我最好是立刻拒绝的，但事实上我当时已经无力进行理性的思考，所以一受邀我就答应了。我不知道自己是怎么离开的。当我再次跨进小巷，门在我身后关上时，我靠在房子的墙壁上擦了擦脸，感到很高兴。西蒙先生那个令人恐惧的幽灵（我可以这样称呼他）在我的记忆中盘旋，就像突发的噪声随后在耳朵里回响一样。关于这家伙的父亲、他的虚伪、他种种不断背信弃义的行为的传言，所有我听到的和读过的，再加上我刚才面对他本人时所亲历的感受，都浮现在我眼前。每一次我想到他精心谋划、意欲恶意诽谤我的人格那种卑鄙行径时，都会令我再度心惊肉跳。在利斯道边绞刑架上那个人的案子似乎和我现在所考虑的自己这桩案子难以区别。两个大男人去抢一个孩子那一丁点东西，着实是件可鄙的事情。但是我自己的事情呢，要是按照西蒙·弗雷泽在法庭上陈述的那样，不论从哪种观点来看都会显得有点儿卑鄙和懦弱了。","I had done better to have instantly refused, but in truth I was beside the power of reasoning; did as I was bid; took my leave I know not how; and when I was forth again in the close, and the door had shut behind me, was glad to lean on a house wall and wipe my face.That horrid apparition (as I may call it) of Mr. Simon rang in my memory, as a sudden noise rings after it is over in the ear.Tales of the man’s father, of his falseness, of his manifold perpetual treacheries, rose before me from all that I had heard and read, and joined on with what I had just experienced of himself.Each time it occurred to me, the ingenious foulness of that calumny he had proposed to nail upon my character startled me afresh.The case of the man upon the gibbet by Leith Walk appeared scarce distinguishable from that I was now to consider as my own.To rob a child of so little more than nothing was certainly a paltry enterprise for two grown men; but my own tale, as it was to be represented in a court by Simon Fraser, appeared a fair second in every possible point of view of sordidness and cowardice."
"门前台阶上，两个普雷斯顿格兰奇家侍从着装的人的说话声把我召回到现实中来。","The voices of two of Prestongrange’s liveried men upon his doorstep recalled me to myself."
"“嗨，”其中一位说，“这个职位让你很快就能升到队长了。”","“Ha’e,” said the one, “this billet as fast as ye can link to the captain.”"
"“是因为那个苏格兰高地的劫匪又回来啦？”另一位问道。","“Is that for the cateran back again?” asked the other."
"“好像是这样。”第一位回答道，“大人和西蒙都在找他呢。”","“It would seem sae,” returned the first.“Him and Simon are seeking him.”"
"“我觉得普雷斯顿格兰奇发疯了。”第二位说，“接下来他会拉上詹姆斯·莫尔和他密切合作的。”","“I think Prestongrange is gane gyte,” says the second.“He’ll have James More in bed with him next.”"
"“好了，那既不不关你的事也不关我的事。”第一位说。","“Weel, it’s neither your affair nor mine’s,” said the first."
"然后他们分开了，一个去办自己的差事，另一个回房子里去了。","And they parted, the one upon his errand, and the other back into the house."
"这样看来情况很不妙。我刚一离开，他们就已经派人去找詹姆斯·莫尔了。我想西蒙先生在说起狱中那些为求保命不择手段的人时，说的肯定就是他。我的头皮一阵阵发麻，可是接着我想起了卡特里奥娜，马上我又浑身热血沸腾了。可怜的姑娘！她父亲因为犯下无可辩解的过错将要被绞死。而更令人难以接受的是：现在为了保全性命他似乎打算去做最无耻的勾当，去进行最卑鄙而懦弱的谋杀——用伪造的证词去谋杀。我们此番在劫难逃，看来我自己就是被挑来做牺牲品的。","This looked as ill as possible.I was scarce gone and they were sending already for James More, to whom I thought Mr. Simon must have pointed when he spoke of men in prison and ready to redeem their lives by all extremities.My scalp curdled among my hair, and the next moment the blood leaped in me to remember Catriona.Poor lass! her father stood to be hanged for pretty indefensible misconduct.What was yet more unpalatable, it now seemed he was prepared to save his four quarters by the worst of shame and the most foul of cowardly murders—murder by the false oath; and to complete our misfortunes, it seemed myself was picked out to be the victim."
"我开始漫无目的地疾走，意识中只剩下对活动、空气和开阔原野的渴望。","I began to walk swiftly and at random, conscious only of a desire for movement, air, and the open country."

"我来到了长堤道，我发誓我真不知道是怎么回事。这是一条乡间小路，从城市的北边蜿蜒而过。我从那里可以看见整条小路像黑色长线逐渐向下延伸，尽头有座城堡矗立在湖边的峭壁上。城堡有一长排尖顶和山墙，还有冒着烟的烟囱。见此景象，我心潮澎湃。我的青年时期，正如我说过的那样，已经习惯了重重危险。可是那天早晨，就在他们称之为城镇的安全之地，我所见识的危险，却是我从未经历过的，令我震惊。受奴役、遇海难、剑伤中弹，这一切艰险我都充满信心地挺过来了。但是西蒙，实际上就是那位洛瓦特勋爵，他尖厉刺耳的嗓音和肥硕的脸庞所带来的危险，把我彻底吓倒了。","I came forth, I vow I know not how, on the Lang Dykes(1).This is a rural road which runs on the north side over against the city.Thence I could see the whole black length of it tail down, from where the castle stands upon its crags above the loch in a long line of spires and gable ends, and smoking chimneys, and at the sight my heart swelled in my bosom.My youth, as I have told, was already inured to dangers; but such danger as I had seen the face of but that morning, in the midst of what they call the safety of a town, shook me beyond experience.Peril of slavery, peril of shipwreck, peril of sword and shot, I had stood all of these without discredit; but the peril there was in the sharp voice and the fat face of Simon, property Lord Lovat, daunted me wholly."
"我在湖边的一个地方坐了下来，那里有几股湍急的溪水奔流而下注入湖中，我在水中泡了泡手腕，洗了洗太阳穴。如果我可以不顾那所剩无几的自尊，我现在就从那莽撞的计划中逃跑了。但是（称之为勇气也好，懦弱也罢，而我觉得是二者兼有）我决定冒险尝试而不考虑退缩的可能性。我曾毫无惧色地面对这些人，我会继续大胆地面对他们，不论会发生什么，我都会坚守我曾说过的话。","I sat by the lake side in a place where the rushes went down into the water, and there steeped my wrists and laved my temples.If I could have done so with any remains of self-esteem, I would now have fled from my foolhardy enterprise.But (call it courage or cowardice, and I believe it was both the one and the other) I decided I was ventured out beyond the possibility of a retreat.I had out-faced these men, I would continue to out-face them; come what might, I would stand by the word spoken."
"感到自己依然意志坚定，我稍微有点儿振奋精神，但还不是很振作。就算在精神最佳时，我内心还是有块冰冷的地方。生活就好像是一桩黑色交易，而你却不得不投身其中。我内心特别同情两个人。一个是我自己，如此孤苦无依，而且身陷重重危险之中。另一个是那位姑娘，詹姆斯·莫尔的女儿。我虽然对她还不是很了解，但是我对她的看法已经形成，而且也已经作出了自己的判断。我认为她是一位正派清白的姑娘，像个男子汉；我认为她是一位宁死不受屈辱的姑娘。但是现在我相信她父亲那一刻正在谈条件，想用我的性命来换取他卑贱的生命。这样在我的思想里就把我和那位姑娘联系了起来。我先前只把她看成是路边的一道风景，尽管是一道令我出奇愉悦的风景。现在突然关系这么近了，我才意识到她是我血仇的女儿，我甚至可以说，就是杀死我的凶手的女儿。我想到，我整天尽为别人的事情如此受折磨和困扰，这真是令人难以忍受，而且我自己毫无快乐可言。我因种种担忧深受其苦，寝食难安。除此之外，我的财富也对我毫无裨益。如果我将被绞死，那么我的日子就很短暂了。如果我不会被绞死而是摆脱了这次困境，那么我在处理完事情之后仍时日方长。她的面庞突然浮现在我的记忆里，正是我第一次看见她时的样子，嘴唇微微张开。那一刻，柔情涌上我的心头，而力量注满了我的双腿，于是我毅然决定动身前往迪安。如果我第二天将被绞死，那么前一夜我就很有可能是睡在地牢里，这是肯定的。我决定要再一次听听卡特里奥娜的诉说，并再次向她倾诉。","The sense of my own constancy somewhat uplifted my spirits, but not much.At the best of it there was an icy place about my heart, and life seemed a black business to be at all engaged in.For two souls in particular my pity flowed.The one was myself, to be so friendless and lost among dangers.The other was the girl, the daughter of James More.I had seen but little of her; yet my view was taken and my judgment made.I thought her a lass of a clean honour, like a man’s; I thought her one to die of a disgrace; and now I believed her father to be at that moment bargaining his vile life for mine.It made a bond in my thoughts betwixt the girl and me.I had seen her before only as a wayside appearance, though one that pleased me strangely; I saw her now in a sudden nearness of relation, as the daughter of my blood foe, and I might say, my murderer.I reflected it was hard I should be so plagued and persecuted all my days for other folks’ affairs, and have no manner of pleasure myself.I got meals and a bed to sleep in when my concerns would suffer it; beyond that my wealth was of no help to me.If I was to hang, my days were like to be short; if I was not to hang but to escape out of this trouble, they might yet seem long to me ere I was done with them.Of a sudden her face appeared in my memory, the way I had first seen it, with the parted lips; at that, weakness came in my bosom and strength into my legs; and I set resolutely forward on the way to Dean.If I was to hang to-morrow, and it was sure enough I might very likely sleep that night in a dungeon, I determined I should hear and speak once more with Catriona."
"一路步行而且一心想着目的地，让我更加振作，所以我开始打起精神了。迪安村坐落在峡谷底部的河边，在村里我向一位磨坊里的人问了路，并按他的指示沿平坦的小路登上了远处的小山，一直走到一座很漂亮的小房子前，房子坐落在一个绿草成茵、种满苹果树的花园里。我走进花园的篱笆时，心跳得很厉害，但是迎面却看到了一位冷峻而严厉的老太太，我的心当即就沉了下去。那位老太太在那里散步，戴着一顶白色宽边帽，可饰带上的帽顶却是男式的。","The exercise of walking and the thought of my destination braced me yet more, so that I began to pluck up a kind of spirit.In the village of Dean, where it sits in the bottom of a glen beside the river, I inquired my way of a miller’s man, who sent me up the hill upon the farther side by a plain path, and so to a decent-like small house in a garden of lawns and apple-trees.My heart beat high as I stepped inside the garden hedge, but it fell low indeed when I came face to face with a grim and fierce old lady, walking there in a white mutch with a man’s hat strapped upon the top of it."
"“你到这里来找什么？”她问。","“What do ye come seeking here?” she asked."
"我告诉她我找德拉蒙德小姐。","I told her I was after Miss Drummond."
"“那你找德拉蒙德小姐有什么事？”她说。","“And what may be your business with Miss Drummond?” says she."
"我告诉她我上个星期六曾遇见过她，很幸运能为她略尽绵薄之力，而现在是应那位年轻女士邀请而来。","I told her I had met her on Saturday last, had been so fortunate as to render her a trifling service, and was come now on the young lady’s invitation."
"“哦，那么说你就是六便士！”她一副非常鄙夷的样子叫喊道，“一份不错的礼物，一个英俊的绅士。你还有其他的名字和称呼吗？或者就称你为六便士？”她问。","“O, so you’re Saxpence!” she cried, with a very sneering manner.“A braw gift, a bonny gentleman.And hae ye ony ither name and designation, or were ye bapteesed Saxpence?” she asked."
"我说出了我的名字。","I told my name."
"“我的天哪！”她喊道，“埃比尼泽有一个儿子？”","“Preserve me!” she cried.“Has Ebenezer gotten a son?”"
"“不对，夫人，”我说，“我是亚历山大的儿子。我才是肖斯的领主。”","“No, ma’am,” said I.“I am a son of Alexander’s.It’s I that am the Laird of Shaws.”"
"“你会发现你做的事情和你的身份很相称。”她说。","“Ye’ll find your work cut out for ye to establish that,” quoth she."
"“我看得出您认识我叔父，”我说，“我猜想听说那件事情已经安排妥当您可能会更高兴。”","“I perceive you know my uncle,” said I; “and I daresay you may be the better pleased to hear that business is arranged.”"
"“那么是什么事情让你来这里找德拉蒙德小姐的？”她追问道。","“And what brings ye here after Miss Drummond?” she pursued."
"“我是来要我那六个便士的，夫人。”我说，“您想想，作为我叔父的侄子，我也会是一个细心谨慎的青年。”","“I’m come after my saxpence, mem,” said I.“It’s to be thought, being my uncle’s nephew, I would be found a careful lad.”"
"“这么说你还是有点儿机灵的？”那位老太太说道，略带赞许的神色，“我觉得你当时很蠢的——什么你和你的六个便士，还有你的幸运日和你为了巴尔惠德山区的缘故。”我很高兴，因为从这些话里我听出卡特里奥娜没有忘记我们之间的交谈。“但是这一切都是别有用心的。”她继续说道，“我是不是可以理解为你到这里来是找伴儿的？”","“So ye have a spark of sleeness in ye?” observed the old lady, with some approval.“I thought ye had just been a cuif—you and your saxpence, and your lucky day and your sake of Balwhidder”—from which I was gratified to learn that Catriona had not forgotten some of our talk.“But all this is by the purpose,” she resumed.“Am I to understand that ye come here keeping company?”"
"“这个问题肯定问得太早了。”我说，“那位女孩还年轻，而更令人遗憾的是，我也很年轻。我就见过她那么一面。我不否认，”我补充说，打定主意对她坦率一点试试看，“我不否认，自从我与她相遇之后，她的身影就经常闯进我的脑海里。那只是一个方面，但是另一方面，我觉得要是我明确表态的话，看起来就会像个傻瓜。”","“This is surely rather an early question,” said I.“The maid is young, so am I, worse fortune.I have but seen her the once.I’ll not deny,” I added, making up my mind to try her with some frankness, “I’ll not deny but she has run in my head a good deal since I met in with her.That is one thing; but it would be quite another, and I think I would look very like a fool, to commit myself.”"
"“我发现，你说话倒是很痛快。”那位老太太说，“赞美主，我也是有话直说的！我真够蠢的，居然照管这个无赖的女儿，这可是我自找的一桩好差事。不过既然是我的事，那我就要按照我的想法做下去。你是想要告诉我，肖斯的鲍尔弗先生，你要娶詹姆斯·莫尔的女儿，而他却会被绞死！好，那么根本就不存在结婚的可能，这件事也不可能有进展，好好想想我说的话吧。姑娘家都是很容易老的。”她点了点头，补充说，“虽然看着我这满脸的皱纹，你永远都想不到，我自己也曾经是一个少女，还是一个美貌少女呢。”","“You can speak out of your mouth, I see,” said the old lady.“Praise God, and so can I!I was fool enough to take charge of this rogue’s daughter: a fine charge I have gotten; but it’s mine, and I’ll carry it the way I want to.Do ye mean to tell me, Mr. Balfour of Shaws, that you would marry James More’s daughter, and him hanged!Well, then, where there’s no possible marriage there shall be no manner of carryings on, and take that for said.Lasses are bruckle things,” she added, with a nod; “and though ye would never think it by my wrunkled chafts, I was a lassie mysel’, and a bonny one.”"
"“阿勒代斯夫人，”我说，“我想那应该是您的名字，您好像在正反两边都帮着说话，要想得出结论这种方式可不行。您问我是否会在绞刑架下和一位我才见过一次面的年轻女士结婚，这着实问中要害了。我已经告诉过您我永远也不会那么随便表态的。然而在某种程度上我也赞同您的看法。如果我一直喜欢那位姑娘，而且我也有理由抱以期望，那么把我们分开的远不只是她的父亲和绞刑架了。至于说我的叔父，我只当他是路边丢弃的半个便士。我不欠我叔父任何东西，如果我要结婚的话，只需要让一个人开心就可以了——那就是我自己。”","“Lady Allardyce,” said I, “for that I suppose to be your name, you seem to do the two sides of the talking, which is a very poor manner to come to an agreement.You give me rather a home thrust when you ask if I would marry, at the gallow’s foot, a young lady whom I have seen but once.I have told you already I would never be so untenty as to commit myself.And yet I’ll go some way with you.If I continue to like the lass as well as I have reason to expect, it will be something more than her father, or the gallows either, that keeps the two of us apart.As for my family, I found it by the wayside like a lost bawbee!I owe less than nothing to my uncle and if ever I marry, it will be to please one person: that’s myself.”"
"“你还在娘胎里的时候我就听说过这种说法了，”奥格尔维夫人说，“也许正因为如此我才很少想到。还有很多事情要考虑。这个詹姆斯·莫尔居然是我的同宗亲戚，说起来都丢脸。但是家族越好，就有越多的人被绞死或者被砍头，乏味的苏格兰故事一直都是那样的。如果只是处以绞刑就好了！就我而言，我倒是觉得看到詹姆斯上绞架我再高兴不过了，那样至少可以结束他的狗命。卡特里奥娜是个很不错的姑娘，她心地善良，只是一直把我这样一个身材矮小的老太婆的话当耳边风。但是，你知道，她是有点儿软弱的。她傻里傻气的，不知道她父亲是个投机冒险、虚伪不忠、欺世盗名之徒。她还为格里格拉人、被褫夺姓氏的家人、詹姆斯国王和少数人的一派胡言而激动愤怒呢。你也许还以为你可以引导她，那你会发现自己是大错特错了。你说你还只见过她一面……”","“I have heard this kind of talk before ye were born,” said Mrs. Ogilvy, “which is perhaps the reason that I think of it so little.There’s much to be considered.This James More is a kinsman of mine, to my shame be it spoken.But the better the family, the mair men hanged or headed, that’s always been poor Scotland’s story.And if it was just the hanging!For my part I think I would be best pleased with James upon the gallows, which would be at least an end to him.Catrine’s a good lass enough, and a good-hearted, and lets herself be deaved all day with a runt of an auld wife like me.But, ye see, there’s the weak bit.She’s daft about that long, false, fleeching beggar of a father of hers, and red-mad about the Gregara, and proscribed names, and King James, and a wheen blethers.And you might think ye could guide her, ye would find yourself sore mista’en.Ye say ye’ve seen her but the once...”"
"“只跟她说过一次话，我本该这么说吧。”我插嘴说，“今天早晨从普雷斯顿格兰奇家的窗户处，我又看见她了。”","“Spoke with her but the once, I should have said,” I interrupted.“I saw her again this morning from a window at Prestongrange’s.”"
"我想我这么说是因为这件事听起来很不错。但是反过来，我却为自己的招摇卖弄彻底付出了代价。","This I daresay I put in because it sounded well; but I was properly paid for my ostentation on the return."
"“这到底是怎么回事？”老太太叫道，脸上突然现出紧张的神色，“我以为你第一次是在检察总长家门前遇到她的。”","“What’s this of it?” cries the old lady, with a sudden pucker of her face.“I think it was at the Advocate’s door-cheek that ye met her first.”"
"我告诉她是那么回事。","I told her that was so."
"“哼，”她说，跟着突然变成一副责骂的腔调，“我要你说实话，”她叫道，“你是什么人？你是干什么的？按照你的说法，你是肖斯的鲍尔弗先生；但是在我看来，你却可能是魔鬼手下的鲍尔弗。有可能你是为了你所说的原因到这里来，可是同样也有可能你是为了鬼才知道的原因而来的！我是个循规蹈矩的辉格党人，也确保我们族人的脑袋留在他们的肩膀上。　但是我不仅仅是个合格的辉格党人，而且还不会受人愚弄，上当受骗。我老实告诉你吧，这里有太多检察总长的眼线了，居然还派一个人来跟踪麦格雷戈的女儿。你可以把这句话转告派你来的检察总长，再代我问个好。你给我滚回去吧，鲍尔弗先生。”她说着，同时做出相应的逐客动作，“滚回你来的地方去，一路走好了。”","“H’m,” she said; and then suddenly, upon rather a scolding tone, “I have your bare word for it,” she cries, “as to who and what you are.By your way of it, you’re Balfour of the Shaws; but for what I ken you may be Balfour of the Deevil’s oxter.It’s possible ye may come here for what ye say, and it’s equally possible ye may come here for deil care what!I’m good enough Whig to sit quiet, and to have keep it all my men-folk’s heads upon their shoulders.But I’m not just a good enough Whig to be made a fool of neither.And I tell you fairly, there’s too much Advocate’s door and Advocate’s window here for a man that comes taigling after a Macgregor’s daughter.Ye can tell that to the Advocate that sent ye, with my fond love.And I kiss my loof to ye, Mr. Balfour,” says she, suiting the action to the word; “and a braw journey to ye back to where ye cam frae.”"
"“如果你认为我是个密探。”我发作起来，可话却堵在喉咙里了。我站在那里狠狠地盯着那老太太看了一阵，鞠了个躬，转身离开了。","“If you think me a spy,” I broke out, and speech stuck in my throat.I stood and looked murder at the old lady for a space, then bowed and turned away."
"“喂！呸！这小子真是呆瓜一个！”她叫道，“把你当成密探？那我该把你当成什么——我从你身上可什么都看不出？不过我想该不是我弄错了吧。既然我不该骂，那我就得道歉了。要是带上腰刀我也会是个了不起的人物的。唉！唉！”她继续说，“看你的样子根本不是个坏小子。但我觉得你有一些需要改掉的坏毛病。但是，哦！戴维·鲍尔弗，你真是个十足的乡巴佬。小伙子，你得尽力争取呀！你要放下身段，要把自己当成小泡菜，不要以为自己有多了不起。你还得弄清楚女人可不是什么大兵。绝不可能是。你这一辈子对女人的了解都不可能有我对母畜生的了解多。”","“Here!Hoots!The callant’s in a creel!” she cried.“Think ye a spy? what else would I think ye—me that kens naething by ye?But I see that I was wrong; and as I cannot fight, I’ll have to apologise.A bonny figure I would be with a broadsword.Ay! ay!” she went on, “you’re none such a bad lad in your way; I think ye’ll have some redeeming vices.But, O!Davit Balfour, ye’re damned countryfeed.Ye’ll have to win over that, lad; ye’ll have to soople your back-bone, and think a wee pickle less of your dainty self; and ye’ll have to try to find out that women-folk are nae grenadiers.But that can never be.To your last day you’ll ken no more of women-folk than what I do of sow-gelding.”"
"我还从来没有从一位女士嘴里听到过这样的话。我只熟悉两位女士——坎贝尔夫人和我的母亲，她们都是最虔诚和最讲究的女人。我想当时我的脸上肯定露出了惊愕不已的神色，因为奥格尔维夫人突然爆发出一阵大笑。","I had never been used with such expressions from a lady’s tongue, the only two ladies I had known, Mrs. Campbell and my mother, being most devout and most particular women; and I suppose my amazement must have been depicted in my countenance, for Mrs. Ogilvy burst forth suddenly in a fit of laughter."
"“我的天哪！”她叫道，强压住笑声，“你长相倒是很俊俏——可你居然要跟高地山贼的女儿结婚！戴维，我亲爱的，如果你们都还是小不点的话，我觉得倒有可能把你们配成一对。但是现在，”她继续说，“你围着这里瞎转悠一点用都没有，因为那个年轻女子不在家。怕是我这个老太婆不配和你父亲的儿子相伴吧。我周围又没有一个人，只有靠我自己来维护我的名声，我和一个来勾引人的年轻人单独相处的时间已经够久了。改天再来要你的六个便士吧！”我离开时，她还在我身后喊道。","“Keep me!” she cried, struggling with her mirth, “you have the finest timber face—and you to marry the daughter of a Hieland cateran!Davie, my dear, I think we’ll have to make a match of it—if it was just to see the weans.And now,” she went on, “there’s no manner of service in your daidling here, for the young woman is from home, and it’s my fear that the old woman is no suitable companion for your father’s son.Forbye that I have nobody but myself to look after my reputation, and have been long enough alone with a sedooctive youth.And come back another day for your saxpence!” she cried after me as I left."
"我和这个令人惊惶的女人之间的这场小冲突却让我的种种想法变得大胆了，原来可是不敢想的。两天来卡特里奥娜的形象已经融入我所有的思绪中，她已成为我进行思考的基础，所以要不是有她在我脑海的角落里熠熠闪光，我简直就无法独处。但是现在她走来了，就近在眼前。我好像就要触摸到她了，除了那一次之外我还从未接触过她。我放纵自己向她奔去，满心欢愉，充满柔情。然而环顾四周，前后张望，我却看到整个世界像一片令人厌恶的沙漠，那里的人们都像行进中的士兵，在坚定不移地尽忠职守，唯独卡特里奥娜为我的这些日子增添了一些快乐。我觉得自己不可思议，在那段历尽危险、蒙受屈辱的日子里，我竟然总是在考虑这类问题。每当我回想起那段年轻时光，我就感到惭愧。我有学业要完成，我得响应号召，干一番有意义的事业；我还要在人人都需尽义务之处尽自己的那份力；我得去学习，去了解，还要去证明自己是个男子汉。意识到自己早就应该做好准备去接受未来更神圣的种种乐趣与责任，这让我不禁羞愧得脸红了。我的家教甚严，除了品尝真理这块硬干粮之外，我在成长的过程中从来没有尝过糖饼的滋味。我知道自己还很不适合为人夫，也没作好为人父的准备。而且像我这样的毛头小子就去当父亲，那只会成为笑柄。","My skirmish with this disconcerting lady gave my thoughts a boldness they had otherwise wanted.For two days the image of Catriona had mixed in all my meditations; she made their background, so that I scarce enjoyed my own company without a glint of her in a corner of my mind.But now she came immediately near; I seemed to touch her, whom I had never touched but the once; I let myself flow out to her in a happy weakness, and looking all about, and before and behind, saw the world like an undesirable desert, where men go as soldiers on a march, following their duty with what constancy they have, and Catriona alone there to offer me some pleasure of my days.I wondered at myself that I could dwell on such considerations in that time of my peril and disgrace; and when I remembered my youth I was ashamed.I had my studies to complete: I had to be called into some useful business; I had yet to take my part of service in a place where all must serve; I had yet to learn, and know, and prove myself a man; and I had so much sense as blush that I should be already tempted with these further-on and holier delights and duties.My education spoke home to me sharply; I was never brought up on sugar biscuits but on the hard food of the truth.I knew that he was quite unfit to be a husband who was not prepared to be a father also; and for a boy like me to play the father was a mere derision."
"我沉浸在这些思绪里，大约走到返回镇子的一半路程时，我看见一个身影朝我走来，我内心越发感到不安。我似乎想把这世上所有的事情说给她听，但是却不知道从何说起。想起那天早晨在检察总长家我那副张口结舌的样子，我肯定自己又会哑口无言了。可是当她走过来时，我的畏惧感消失不见了，甚至连我私下里想到她时的那种惶恐不安也瞬间了无踪影。我发现自己居然可以轻松、理智地与她交谈，就像和艾伦说话时一样。","When I was in the midst of these thoughts and about half-way back to town I saw a figure coming to meet me, and the trouble of my heart was heightened.It seemed I had everything in the world to say to her, but nothing to say first; and remembering how tongue-tied I had been that morning at the Advocate’s I made sure that I would find myself struck dumb.But when she came up my fears fled away; not even the consciousness of what I had been privately thinking disconcerted me the least; and I found I could talk with her as easily and rationally as I might with Alan."
"“哦！”她喊道，“你是来要你那六个便士的，你拿到了吗？”","“O!” she cried, “you have been seeking your sixpence; did you get it?”"
"我告诉她没有拿到，不过现在遇见她也就不枉此行了。“不过我今天已经见过你了。”我说，并告诉了她是何时何地见过的。","I told her no; but now I had met with her my walk was not in vain.“Though I have seen you to-day already,” said I, and told her where and when."
"“我没有看见你。”她说，“我的眼睛虽然大，但看远处就不如别人了。我只听到房子里有人在唱歌。”","“I did not see you,” she said.“My eyes are big, but there are better than mine at seeing far.Only I heard singing in the house.”"
"“那是格兰特小姐，”我说，“年龄最大的，也是最漂亮的那位。”","“That was Miss Grant,” said I, “the eldest and the bonniest.”"
"“人们说她们都很美丽。”她说。“她们也认为你很美，德拉蒙德小姐，”我回答道，“而且她们都挤在窗户边想看你。”","“They say they are all beautiful,” said she.“They think the same of you, Miss Drummond,” I replied, “and were all crowding to the window to observe you.”"
"“很遗憾我视力那么差，”她说，“要不然的话，我也许就看到她们了。你也在那座房子里吗？有美妙的音乐和美貌的淑女们为伴，你一定度过了一段美好时光。”","“It is a pity about my being so blind,” said she, “or I might have seen them too.And you were in the house?You must have been having the fine time with the fine music and the pretty ladies.”"
"“你正好说错了，”我说，“因为我就像一条被丢在山坡上的海鱼一样，很不自在。事实上，我更适合与粗鲁的男士相处，而不适合与美貌的淑女们在一起。”","“There is just where you are wrong,” said I; “for I was as uncouth as a sea-fish upon the brae of a mountain.The truth is that I am better fitted to go about with rudas men than pretty ladies.”"
"“哦，无论如何我也是这么认为的！”她说，对此我们俩都笑了起来。","“Well, I would think so too, at all events!” said she, at which we both of us laughed."
"“这可真是一件怪事，”我说，“我一点也不害怕和你相处，可是我却恨不能逃离那几位格兰特小姐。而且我也很害怕你的那位亲戚。”","“It is a strange thing, now,” said I.“I am not the least afraid with you, yet I could have run from the Miss Grants.And I was afraid of your cousin too.”"
"“噢，我觉得任何男人都会怕她的，”她叫道，“我父亲本人也害怕她。”","“O, I think any man will be afraid of her,” she cried.“My father is afraid of her himself.”"
"听她提到她的父亲，我不禁一怔。她走在我身边，我看着她，想起了那个男人，我对他知之甚少却又猜测颇多。把他们父女俩进行比较，感觉就像让叛徒不告密一样。","The name of her father brought me to a stop.I looked at her as she walked by my side; I recalled the man, and the little I knew and the much I guessed of him; and comparing the one with the other, felt like a traitor to be silent."
"“说到你父亲，”我说，“就在今天早晨我才遇见过他。”","“Speaking of which,” said I, “I met your father no later than this morning.”"
"“真的？”她喊道，声音里透着欣喜，可又像是在嘲笑我。“你看见詹姆斯·莫尔啦？那么你还和他说过话了？”","“Did you?” she cried, with a voice of joy that seemed to mock at me.“You saw James More?You will have spoken with him then?”"
"“我是和他说过话。”我说。","“I did even that,” said I."
"我想当时事情是朝着对我来说最坏的方向发展的，不会有更坏的了。她充满感激地看了我一眼。“啊，谢谢你能那么做！”她说。","Then I think things went the worst way for me that was humanly possible.She gave me a look of mere gratitude.“Ah, thank you for that!” says she."
"“你不必谢我的。”我说，然后止住了。但是似乎在我拼命克制自己时，有些东西却不可抑制地要爆发出来。“我对他说话的态度很不好，”我说，“我不太喜欢他。我对他说话的态度很恶劣，所以他很生气。”","“You thank me for very little,” said I, and then stopped.But it seemed when I was holding back so much, something at least had to come out.“I spoke rather ill to him,” said I; “I did no like him very much; I spoke him rather ill, and he was angry.”"
"“我觉得你不该那么做，更不该告诉他的女儿！”她叫喊道，“那些你不喜欢、不珍惜他的话，我都不想听。”","“I think you had little to do then, and less to tell it to his daughter!” she cried out.“But those that do not love and cherish him I will not know.”"
"“我也有说话的自由。”我说，开始颤抖起来，“也许我和你父亲在普雷斯顿格兰奇家心情都不太好。我想当时我们俩都很担心，因为那是一栋充满危险的房子。我也替他感到难过，所以我先开口对他说话的，只是如果我能说得更聪明一点就好了。不过，有一点，在我看来，是你很快会发现的，那就是他的事态在好转。”","“I will take the freedom of a word yet,” said I, beginning to tremble.“Perhaps neither your father nor I are in the best of spirits at Prestongrange’s.I daresay we both have anxious business there, for it’s a dangerous house.I was sorry for him too, and spoke to him the first, if I could but have spoken the wiser.And for one thing, in my opinion, you will soon find that his affairs are mending.”"
"“我在想，那不会让你们的友谊破裂，”她说，“因为他是怕你难过，才净跟你说些好听的。”","“It will not be through your friendship, I am thinking,” said she; “and he is much made up to you for your sorrow.”"
"“德拉蒙德小姐，”我喊道，“我在这世界上孑然一身。”","“Miss Drummond,” cried I, “I am alone in this world.”"
"“我对此并不觉得奇怪。”她说。","“And I am not wondering at that,” said she."
"“哦，让我来说！”我说，“我只说这一次，然后我就离开你，如果你愿意，就永远离开你。我今天来这里是希望听到我迫切需要的关切话语。我知道我所说的话肯定伤害到你了，而且我说的时候就知道。要想说得和缓一点很容易做到，对你撒谎也很容易，难道你不觉得我也很想那么做吗？难道你看不出那是我内心真实想法的自然流露吗？”","“O, let me speak!” said I.“I will speak but the once, and then leave you, if you will, for ever.I came this day in the hopes of a kind word that I am sore in want of.I know that what I said must hurt you, and I knew it then.It would have been easy to have spoken smooth, easy to lie to you; can you not think how I was tempted to the same?Cannot you see the truth of my heart shine out?”"
"“我认为现在还有很多事情要做，鲍尔弗先生，”她说，“我认为我们只会见这一次面了，然后就会非常有礼貌地分别。”","“I think here is a great deal of work, Mr. Balfour,” said she.“I think we will have met but the once, and will can part like gentle folk.”"
"“哦，就相信我一次吧！”我恳求道，“我再也无法忍受了。整个世界联合起来跟我作对。我如何才能熬过这糟糕透顶的命运？　如果没有人相信我的话，我就做不成这件事。那个男人一定会死，因为我做不成这件事。”","“O, let me have one to believe in me!”I pleaded, “I cannae bear it else.The whole world is clanned against me.How am I to go through with my dreadful fate?If there’s to be none to believe in me I cannot do it.The man must just die, for I cannot do it.”"
"她仍然直视着前方，昂头迎着风。不过听到我说的话或者是我说话的语气，她停了下来。“你说的这件事是什么事？”她问，“你要说什么呢？”","She had still looked straight in front of her, head in air; but at my words or the tone of my voice she came to a stop.“What is this you say?” she asked.“What are you talking of?”"
"“只有我的证词才可以救一条无辜的性命，”我说，“不过他们不会让我去承担这个责任的。如果是你的话，你会怎么做？你知道这是怎么回事，因为你的父亲正处于危险之中。你会弃这可怜的人于不顾吗？他们已经对我用尽了各种手段。他们企图贿赂我，他们给我许诺金山银谷。而且今天那个狗腿子还告诫我，说我的处境如何如何，还说，到一定时候他就会判我死刑，还要让我身败名裂。我将被牵扯进一桩谋杀案中；我将为了钱和一些旧衣服而卷入格伦努尔案件；我会被杀，还要蒙受耻辱。如果我将落得这样的下场，而我都还算不上是个男子汉呢——如果这就是传遍整个苏格兰的关于我的故事——如果你也会去相信，那么我的名字就只会成为他人的笑柄——卡特里奥娜，我怎样才能够挺过这一切？这是不可能的，这已经超出了一个人所能承受的。”","“It is my testimony which may save an innocent life,” said I, “and they will not suffer me to bear it.What would you do yourself?You know what this is, whose father lies in danger.Would you desert the poor soul?They have tried all ways with me.They have sought to bribe me; they offered me hills and valleys.And to-day that sleuth-hound told me how I stood, and to what a length he would go to butcher and disgrace me.I am to be brought in a party to the murder; I am to have held Glenure in talk for money and old clothes; I am to be killed and shamed.If this is the way I am to fall, and me scarce a man—if this is the story to be told of me in all Scotland—if you are to believe it too, and my name is to be nothing but a by-word—Catriona, how can I go through with it?The thing’s not possible; it’s more than a man has in his heart.”"
"我一股脑把这些话一句接一句地倒了出来，当我停住话时，我发现她面色惊愕地注视着我。","I poured my words out in a whirl, one upon the other; and when I stopped I found her gazing on me with a startled face."
"“格伦努尔！那是阿平凶杀案。”她柔声说道，但是带着极度的惊讶。","“Glenure!It is the Appin murder,” she said softly, but with a very deep surprise."
"我已经转身陪她往回走了，我们已经快走到迪安村上面的斜坡顶了。听到这句话，我迈步站到她面前，突然感到思绪纷乱。","I had turned back to bear her company, and we were now come near the head of the brae above Dean village.At this word I stepped in front of her like one suddenly distracted."
"“看在上帝的份上！”我叫道，“看在上帝的份上，我这是做了什么呀？”我用拳头捶着自己的太阳穴，“我怎么会做出这样的事情？我肯定是中了邪，居然把这些事情都说出来了！”","“For God’s sake!” I cried, “for God’s sake, what is this that I have done?” and carried my fists to my temples.“What made me do it?Sure, I am bewitched to say these things!”"
"“天哪，是什么让你现在这么痛苦啊！”她叫道。","“In the name of heaven, what ails you now!” she cried."
"“我看重自己的信誉，”我呻吟道，“我看重自己的信誉，可我现在把它给毁了。哦，卡特里奥娜！”","“I gave my honour,” I groaned, “I gave my honour and now I have broke it.O, Catriona!”"
"“我在问你是怎么回事，”她说，“是因为这些事情你不该说吗？那么，难道你认为我就不讲信用吗？或者你认为我是那种会出卖朋友的人？我举右手向你发誓。”","“I am asking you what it is,” she said; “was it these things you should not have spoken?And do you think I have no honour, then?or that I am one that would betray a friend?I hold up my right hand to you and swear.”"
"“哦，我知道你为人真诚！”我说，“我说的是我——就是这件事。我今天早晨还站在那里义正言辞地面对他们，宁愿冒着在绞刑架上蒙羞而死的危险，也不愿意犯错误——可是才过了几个小时，我就在路边的闲谈中弃自己的信誉而不顾了！‘从我们的会面来看好像有一件事情是很清楚的，’他说，‘那就是我可以信赖你的誓言’。现在我的誓言在哪里呢？现在谁还会相信我呢？你不可能相信我了。我完全失信于人了，我最好去死！”这一切我都是带着一种哭腔说的，但是我根本哭不出来。","“O, I knew you would be true!” said I.“It’s me—it’s here.I that stood but this morning and out-faced them, that risked rather to die disgraced upon the gallows than do wrong—and a few hours after I throw my honour away by the roadside in common talk!‘There is one thing clear upon our interview,’ says he, ‘that I can rely on your pledged word.’  Where is my word now?Who could believe me now?You could not believe me.I am clean fallen down; I had best die!”All this I said with a weeping voice, but I had no tears in my body."
"“我的心在为你而痛，”她说，“但是可以肯定你为人太好了。你说我不会相信你，是吗？我任何事情都会相信你的。至于那些家伙？我才不会想到他们呢！那些家伙设圈套想毁掉你！呸！现在没有时间卑躬屈膝。抬头看看！难道你不觉得我会像钦佩一个善良的大英雄那样钦佩你——而你只是一个比我没大多少的男孩？只因为你向一位朋友的耳中多说了一句话，而她是宁死也不会背叛你的——就会惹出这样一个问题！这件事情我们两人都必须忘记。”","“My heart is sore for you,” said she, “but be sure you are too nice.I would not believe you, do you say?I would trust you with anything.And these men?I would not be thinking of them!Men who go about to entrap and to destroy you!Fy! this is no time to crouch.Look up!Do you not think I will be admiring you like a great hero of the good—and you a boy not much older than myself?And because you said a word too much in a friend’s ear, that would die ere she betrayed you—to make such a matter!It is one thing that we must both forget.”"
"“卡特里奥娜，”我说，谦卑地看着她，“这是真的吗？你还会相信我吗？”","“Catriona,” said I, looking at her, hang-dog, “is this true of it?Would ye trust me yet?”"
"“你不相信我脸上的眼泪吗？”她喊道，“这就是我在想的你的世界，戴维·鲍尔弗先生。让他们去绞死你吧，我永远都不会忘记你，我会变老，但永远会记得你。我认为这样去死很伟大，我都会嫉妒你那副绞架的。”","“Will you not believe the tears upon my face?” she cried.“It is the world I am thinking of you, Mr. David Balfour.Let them hang you; I will never forget, I will grow old and still remember you.I think it is great to die so: I will envy you that gallows.”"
"“也许这么久以来我都像是一个害怕妖怪的孩子。”我说，“也许他们只是在耍弄我而已。”","“And maybe all this while I am but a child frighted with bogles,” said I.“Maybe they but make a mock of me.”"
"“这正是我必须知道的，”她说，“我必须了解整件事情。不论怎么说，伤害已经造成，而我必须了解整件事情。”","“It is what I must know,” she said.“I must hear the whole.The harm is done at all events, and I must hear the whole.”"
"我在路边坐了下来，她坐在我身旁，于是我就把那件事情全部都告诉她了，跟我写下来的一样多，唯独省略了我对他父亲的种种看法。","I had sat down on the wayside, where she took a place beside me, and I told her all that matter much as I have written it, my thoughts about her father’s dealings being alone omitted."
"“嗯，”我讲完以后，她说，“你是一位英雄，真的，我还从来没有这么想过！而且我觉得你处境也很危险。哦，西蒙·弗雷泽！想想那个家伙吧！他为了自己活命和得到肮脏的钱，居然去做这样的交易！”就在那时她大声喊出了一个她常用的奇怪的词，我认为，那属于她的本族语言。“这下糟了！”她说，“看那太阳！”","“Well,” she said, when I had finished, “you are a hero, surely, and I never would have thought that same!And I think you are in peril, too.O, Simon Fraser! to think upon that man!For his life and the dirty money, to be dealing in such traffic!”And just then she called out aloud with a queer word that was common with her, and belongs, I believe, to her own language.“My torture!” says she, “look at the sun!”"
"确实，太阳已经向山后落下。","Indeed, it was already dipping towards the mountains."
"她吩咐我尽快再来，伸手与我相握，让我感到一阵欢喜。因为担心一回去就会立即被捕，我拖延着不回住处。我在一家小客栈吃了点晚饭，之后就在大麦地里独自散步，度过了那晚的一大段美好时光。当时我有一种感觉，卡特里奥娜就在我跟前，我好像还把她挽在臂弯里了。","She bid me come again soon, gave me her hand, and left me in a turmoil of glad spirits.I delayed to go home to my lodging, for I had a terror of immediate arrest; but got some supper at a change house, and the better part of that night walked by myself in the barley-fields, and had such a sense of Catriona’s presence that I seemed to bear her in my arms."
"第八章　刺客","CHAPTER VIII—THE BRAVO"
"第二天，8月29日，我如约到检察总长家，身上穿着量身定做的外套，而且是最近才做好的。","The next day, August 29th, I kept my appointment at the Advocate’s in a coat that I had made to my own measure, and was but newly ready,"
"“啊哈，”普雷斯顿格兰奇说，“你今天很英俊，我的那些姑娘将会见到一位英俊的骑士了。来吧，我喜欢你这个样子。我喜欢你这个样子，戴维先生。哦，我们会处理好的，我相信你的麻烦就快结束了。”","“Aha,” says Prestongrange, “you are very fine to-day; my misses are to have a fine cavalier.Come, I take that kind of you.I take that kind of you, Mr. David.O, we shall do very well yet, and I believe your troubles are nearly at an end.”"
"“你有消息要告诉我？”我喊道。","“You have news for me?” cried I."
"“出乎意料，”他回答，“你的证词终于被接受了。只要你愿意，你就可以跟我一起参加庭审，下个月21号星期四将在因弗雷里开庭。”","“Beyond anticipation,” he replied.“Your testimony is after all to be received; and you may go, if you will, in my company to the trial, which in to be held at Inverary, Thursday, 21st proximo.”"
"我感到非常吃惊，都找不出合适的话来回答了。","I was too much amazed to find words."
"“这段时间内，”他继续说道，“虽然我不会要求你重申你的誓言，但是我必须得警告你要严守沉默。明天肯定会对你进行预审。除此之外，你要明白，我认为说得越少，越好补救。”","“In the meanwhile,” he continued, “though I will not ask you to renew your pledge, I must caution you strictly to be reticent.To-morrow your precognition must be taken; and outside of that, do you know, I think least said will be soonest mended.”"
"“我会尽量小心行事的。”我说，“我相信这都是多亏了您无上的仁慈，我真的非常感谢您。在经历了昨日之事后，大人，这就像是开启了天堂之门。我内心简直不敢相信这件事是真的。”","“I shall try to go discreetly,’ said I.“I believe it is yourself that I must thank for this crowning mercy, and I do thank you gratefully.After yesterday, my lord, this is like the doors of Heaven.I cannot find it in my heart to get the thing believed.”"
"“啊，但你必须尽量做到，你必须尽量做到相信它。”他一副宽慰的样子说道，“听说你愿意承担起义务，我真的很高兴，因为我想可能你很快就可以回报我了。”他咳嗽起来，“甚至就是现在。事情变化很大。你的证词——我今天不该以此麻烦你的，但它无疑会使所有和案件相关的局面得到改观，所以对我来说要和你讨论的其他问题就没那么细致了。”","“Ah, but you must try and manage, you must try and manage to believe it,” says he, soothing-like, “and I am very glad to hear your acknowledgment of obligation, for I think you may be able to repay me very shortly”—he coughed—“or even now.The matter is much changed.Your testimony, which I shall not trouble you for to-day, will doubtless alter the complexion of the case for all concerned, and this makes it less delicate for me to enter with you on a side issue.”"
"“大人，”我打断说，“请原谅我打断您，可是怎么会出现这样的结果？星期六您告诉我的那些障碍，甚至在我看来都是非常难以克服的。事情是怎么给处理好的呢？”","“My Lord,” I interrupted, “excuse me for interrupting you, but how has this been brought about?The obstacles you told me of on Saturday appeared even to me to be quite insurmountable; how has it been contrived?”"
"“亲爱的戴维先生，”他说，“我是永远也不会泄露（即使对你，就像你说的）政府会议的决策的。如果你愿意，你能了解大概的事实就应该知足了。”","“My dear Mr. David,” said he, “it would never do for me to divulge (even to you, as you say) the councils of the Government; and you must content yourself, if you please, with the gross fact.”"
"他说话时像个父亲一样对我微笑着，一边还把玩着一支新笔。我认为这个人不可能在耍任何骗人的把戏。可是当他拿出一张纸来，蘸了笔墨，再次开始对我说话时，我不知怎么就没那么有把握了，于是本能地进入一种防卫状态。","He smiled upon me like a father as he spoke, playing the while with a new pen; methought it was impossible there could be any shadow of deception in the man: yet when he drew to him a sheet of paper, dipped his pen among the ink, and began again to address me, I was somehow not so certain, and fell instinctively into an attitude of guard."
"“有一点我想提一下。”他开始说，“我之前有意把它搁置一边，但是现在已经不再有那种必要了。当然，这不是对你的审查的一部分，跟着另外会有人去审查的。这纯属我个人想知道的事。你说你在小山上遇见了艾伦·布雷克？”","“There is a point I wish to touch upon,” he began.“I purposely left it before upon one side, which need be now no longer necessary.This is not, of course, a part of your examination, which is to follow by another hand; this is a private interest of my own.You say you encountered Alan Breck upon the hill?”"
"“是的，大人。”我说。","“I did, my lord,” said I"
"“是在凶杀案刚发生之后吗？","“This was immediately after the murder?”"
"“是的。”","“It was.”"
"“你和他说话了吗？”","“Did you speak to him?”"
"“说了。”","“I did.”"
"“我想，你以前就认识他？”检察总长不经意地说道。","“You had known him before, I think?” says my lord, carelessly."
"“我不清楚您为何会这么想，大人。”我回答道，“不过事实的确如此。”","“I cannot guess your reason for so thinking, my lord,” I replied, “but such in the fact.”"
"“那么你什么时候再次跟他分手的？”他说。","“And when did you part with him again?” said he."
"“我保留回答，”我说，“这个问题在庭上会问我的。”","“I reserve my answer,” said I.“The question will be put to me at the assize.”"
"“鲍尔弗先生，”他说，“难道你还不明白这一切对你本人没有任何影响吗？我已经承诺过要保护你的生命和名誉，要相信我，我会信守诺言的。所以你一切都不要担心。看样子你以为你能够保护艾伦。你对我说到你的感激之情，我认为（如果你硬要我说的话）那也是当之无愧的。虽然有很多不同的考虑，但都指向了同一条路。我绝不相信你就不能帮助我们（只要你愿意）去抓住艾伦。”","“Mr. Balfour,” said he, “will you not understand that all this is without prejudice to yourself?I have promised you life and honour; and, believe me, I can keep my word.You are therefore clear of all anxiety.Alan, it appears, you suppose you can protect; and you talk to me of your gratitude, which I think (if you push me) is not ill-deserved.There are a great many different considerations all pointing the same way; and I will never be persuaded that you could not help us (if you chose) to put salt on Alan’s tail.”"
"“大人，”我说，“我向您保证我也猜不到艾伦会在哪里。”","“My lord,” said I, “I give you my word I do not so much as guess where Alan is.”"
"他一下子屏住了呼吸。“你也不知道怎样才可能找到他？”他问道。","He paused a breath.“Nor how he might be found?” he asked."
"我像一截木头似地坐在他面前。","I sat before him like a log of wood."
"“你的感谢到此为止，鲍尔弗先生！”他说道。又一次陷入短暂的沉默。“好吧，”他站起身说，“我运气不好，我们两个人志趣不同。我们就不再谈论这个话题了。你将会接到通知，告知我们对你开始预审的时间、地点以及预审人。现在这会儿，我的姑娘们一定在等你了。要是我扣留了她们的骑士，她们永远都不会原谅我的。”","“And so much for your gratitude, Mr. David!” he observed.Again there was a piece of silence.“Well,” said he, rising, “I am not fortunate, and we are a couple at cross purposes.Let us speak of it no more; you will receive notice when, where, and by whom, we are to take your precognition.And in the meantime, my misses must be waiting you.They will never forgive me if I detain their cavalier.”"
"于是我就被交到了这些优雅女士的手中，我发现她们衣着远远超出我的想象，看起来都像花一样美丽。","Into the hands of these Graces I was accordingly offered up, and found them dressed beyond what I had thought possible, and looking fair as a posy."
"我们穿过大门往前走时，发生了一件小事，可后来看起来这件事却大极了。我听到一声很响亮的口哨，很短，像是一发信号，我环顾四周，瞬间看到了汤姆的尼尔（即邓肯的儿子）那头红头发。但是顷刻之后他又不见了。虽然我连卡特里奥娜的裙角都没有看见，可是我很自然地想到他是陪她来的。","As we went forth from the doors a small circumstance occurred which came afterwards to look extremely big.I heard a whistle sound loud and brief like a signal, and looking all about, spied for one moment the red head of Neil of the Tom, the son of Duncan.The next moment he was gone again, nor could I see so much as the skirt-tail of Catriona, upon whom I naturally supposed him to be then attending."
"我那三位看护人领着我走出布里斯托和布朗茨菲尔德球场。那里有条小路引我们直到霍普公园。那是一个美丽的庭院，铺着沙砾小路，备有座椅和夏天的遮阳棚，还有一位看园人守护着。一路上显得有点儿冗长乏味，那两位年轻些的姑娘故作优雅的慵懒样子，让我很扫兴，年纪最大的那位好像还体谅我，不时显出欢快的样子。我认为自己比前一天做得恰当一些了，而且也并非没有一点效果。一到公园，她们就把我引荐给一群绅士，有八到十位吧（其中有些是带着帽章的军官，其余则主要是律师），他们争着向这些美人大献殷勤。尽管她们以赞美的言辞把我介绍给了他们所有的人，但是好像我立刻就被所有的人给忘记了。这些成群结伴的年轻人就像猛兽一样：他们毫无礼貌地攻击或者嘲讽一个陌生人，或许我可以说，根本就没有人性。我敢肯定，如果我身处狒狒群中，它们向我显示出的样子会完全相同。有些律师在竭力卖弄才智，有些军人则在喋喋不休，我说不出到底是哪一种作派让我更厌烦。所有的人都身配利剑，穿着长裾外套，为此（仅仅出于极端的妒忌）我真想把他们从公园给踢出去。我猜想，在他们那边，对我携美而来这件事也一定是嫉妒万分了。总之，我很快就落在后面了，拘谨地跟在他们的欢笑声后走着，在想着自己的心事。","My three keepers led me out by Bristo and the Bruntsfield Links; whence a path carried us to Hope Park, a beautiful pleasance, laid with gravel-walks, furnished with seats and summer-sheds, and warded by a keeper.The way there was a little longsome; the two younger misses affected an air of genteel weariness that damped me cruelly, the eldest considered me with something that at times appeared like mirth; and though I thought I did myself more justice than the day before, it was not without some effort.Upon our reaching the park I was launched on a bevy of eight or ten young gentlemen (some of them cockaded officers, the rest chiefly advocates) who crowded to attend upon these beauties; and though I was presented to all of them in very good words, it seemed I was by all immediately forgotten.Young folk in a company are like to savage animals: they fall upon or scorn a stranger without civility, or I may say, humanity; and I am sure, if I had been among baboons, they would have shown me quite as much of both.Some of the advocates set up to be wits, and some of the soldiers to be rattles; and I could not tell which of these extremes annoyed me most.All had a manner of handling their swords and coat-skirts, for the which (in mere black envy) I could have kicked them from the park.I daresay, upon their side, they grudged me extremely the fine company in which I had arrived; and altogether I had soon fallen behind, and stepped stiffly in the rear of all that merriment with my own thoughts."
"我的思绪被一位军官给打断了，陆军中尉赫克托·邓肯斯比，一个愚笨、满眼恶意的高地小伙子，问我是否姓“抛尔弗”。","From these I was recalled by one of the officers, Lieutenant Hector Duncansby, a gawky, leering Highland boy, asking if my name was not “Palfour.”"
"我告诉他是的，态度不是很友善，因为他的样子也缺乏礼貌。","I told him it was, not very kindly, for his manner was scant civil."
"“哈，抛尔弗，”他说，然后就重复着，“抛尔弗，抛尔弗！”","“Ha, Palfour,” says he, and then, repeating it, “Palfour, Palfour!”"
"“恐怕您是不喜欢我的姓名吧，先生。”我说，为自己生这个乡巴佬的气而烦躁。","“I am afraid you do not like my name, sir,” says I, annoyed with myself to be annoyed with such a rustical fellow."
"“不是，”他说，“不过我正在想。”","“No,” says he, “but I wass thinking.”"
"“我建议您不要那么念叨，先生，”我说，“我肯定您会发现那并不适合您。”","“I would not advise you to make a practice of that, sir,” says I.“I feel sure you would not find it to agree with you.”"
"“你听说过在哪里可以找到艾伦·格里戈尔的踪迹吗？”他说。","“Tit you effer hear where Alan Grigor fand the tangs?” said he."
"我问他那是什么意思，而他大声狂笑着回答说他认为我是心知肚明却欲盖弥彰。","I asked him what he could possibly mean, and he answered, with a heckling laugh, that he thought I must have found the poker in the same place and swallowed it."
"他说的一点都不错，我的脸颊发烫了。","There could be no mistake about this, and my cheek burned."
"“在我开始冒犯绅士之前，”我说，“我觉得我首先要学学英语。”","“Before I went about to put affronts on gentlemen,” said I, “I think I would learn the English language first.”"
"他点点头，使了个眼色，拉着我的袖子悄悄带我出了霍普公园。但是我们刚一走出散步的人的视线之外，他脸上的神色立刻就变了。“你这个低地的杂种！”他叫道，握紧拳头对着我的下颚猛击一拳。","He took me by the sleeve with a nod and a wink and led me quietly outside Hope Park.But no sooner were we beyond the view of the promenaders, than the fashion of his countenance changed.“You tam lowland scoon’rel!” cries he, and hit me a buffet on the jaw with his closed fist."
"我狠狠地回了他一拳，或许更重，于是他后退了一小步，然后有礼貌地对我摘下他的帽子。","I paid him as good or better on the return; whereupon he stepped a little back and took off his hat to me decorously."
"“我想打够了，”他说，“我才是受到羞辱的绅士，有谁听说过这样一位绅士，还是皇家军官，居然说不好标准英语？我们就用剑来解决问题吧，这附近就是国王公园。你先走还是让我给你带路？”","“Enough plows I think,” says he.“I will be the offended shentleman, for who effer heard of such suffeeciency as tell a shentlemans that is the king’s officer he cannae speak Cot’s English?We have swords at our hurdles, and here is the King’s Park at hand.Will ye walk first, or let me show ye the way?”"
"我回了他一个鞠躬礼，告诉他先走，随后我就跟着他走。他一边走着，我听到他一边自言自语嘟嚷着标准英语和皇家军装，所以我揣测他是被深深地触怒了。但是我们刚见面时他的举止就给人这种印象。显然，不论对错，他是有备而来要找我的茬的。这表明我的敌人又在图谋对我耍新的诡计，对我（意识到是我的不足）更足以表明我是注定会有此遭遇的。","I returned his bow, told him to go first, and followed him.As he went I heard him grumble to himself about Cot’s English and the King’s coat, so that I might have supposed him to be seriously offended.But his manner at the beginning of our interview was there to belie him.It was manifest he had come prepared to fasten a quarrel on me, right or wrong; manifest that I was taken in a fresh contrivance of my enemies; and to me (conscious as I was of my deficiencies) manifest enough that I should be the one to fall in our encounter."
"我们来到国王公园那崎岖不平、尽是岩石的荒地时，我好几次都想提起脚跟逃跑了事，我实在不愿意暴露出我不懂剑术，也很不情愿去死抑或是受伤。但是我考虑到若是他们的恶意已经到了如此地步，那他们就会无所顾忌。而命丧剑下虽然不雅，但还是比上绞架好多了。除此之外，我还想到由于我出言不逊，出拳迅猛，使我自己处境相当被动。就算我现在跑掉了，我的对手也可能会追赶并抓住我，那就会给我的厄运增添耻辱。所以，思前虑后，我继续跟在他后面前行，很像是跟在刽子手后面受刑的人，当然没有希望可言。","As we came into that rough rocky desert of the King’s Park I was tempted half-a-dozen times to take to my heels and run for it, so loath was I to show my ignorance in fencing, and so much averse to die or even to be wounded.But I considered if their malice went as far as this, it would likely stick at nothing; and that to fall by the sword, however ungracefully, was still an improvement on the gallows.I considered besides that by the unguarded pertness of my words and the quickness of my blow I had put myself quite out of court; and that even if I ran, my adversary would probably pursue and catch me, which would add disgrace to my misfortune.So that, taking all in all, I continued marching behind him, much as a man follows the hangman, and certainly with no more hope."
"我们走过长长峭壁的尽头，进入了猎人沼泽。这里，在一片美丽的草地上，我的对手拔出了剑。 除了几只小鸟，没有任何人在看我们。我别无他法，只好学着他的样子，尽量摆出最佳姿态站立防守着。邓肯斯比先生好像不怎么满意，他观察着我动作中的破绽，停顿了一下，目光锐利地看着我，然后不时走动几步，并且在空中挥舞着他的剑威吓我。因为我根本没有见过艾伦做过这样的举动，况且还极大地受着死亡逼近的影响，我愈加慌乱，无助地站在那里，只盼着能够逃跑。","We went about the end of the long craigs, and came into the Hunter’s Bog.Here, on a piece of fair turf, my adversary drew.There was nobody there to see us but some birds; and no resource for me but to follow his example, and stand on guard with the best face I could display.It seems it was not good enough for Mr. Dancansby, who spied some flaw in my manoeuvres, paused, looked upon me sharply, and came off and on, and menaced me with his blade in the air.As I had seen no such proceedings from Alan, and was besides a good deal affected with the proximity of death, I grew quite bewildered, stood helpless, and could have longed to run away."
"“蠢鬼居然让她痛苦？”中尉叫喊道。","“Fat deil ails her?” cries the lieutenant."
"他突然动手攻击，猛然一抽，我的剑就脱手而出，飞落在远处的灯芯草丛里。","And suddenly engaging, he twitched the sword out of my grasp and sent it flying far among the rushes."
"这样的动作重复了两次，当我第三次捡回那让我丢尽脸面的武器时，我发现他已经把自己的剑插回剑鞘中，一脸愤怒地站在那里等着我，他的双手在长裾下紧握着。","Twice was this manoeuvre repeated; and the third time when I brought back my humiliated weapon, I found he had returned his own to the scabbard, and stood awaiting me with a face of some anger, and his hands clasped under his skirt."
"“要是我刺中你了，你就见鬼去吧！”他叫道，然后忿忿不平地质问我既然我对剑术一窍不通，我有什么权利站在“绅士”的面前。","“Pe tamned if I touch you!” he cried, and asked me bitterly what right I had to stand up before “shentlemans” when I did not know the back of a sword from the front of it."
"我回答说那是我教养上的缺陷，而他是否会给我一个公正评价，说我已经倾尽少得可怜的全力，让他完全满意，而且已经像个男子汉一样挺身而出了？ ","I answered that was the fault of my upbringing; and would he do me the justice to say I had given him all the satisfaction it was unfortunately in my power to offer, and had stood up like a man?"
"“那倒是实话。”他说，“我自己很勇敢，并且大胆得像头狮子。但是你只是站在那里——而且你丝毫不懂剑术！你这种样子，我宣布我下不了手。我为刚才的攻击行为道歉，不过我声明我认为你比我年长，而且现在我心里还是这么想的。我还声明如果我事先知道是怎么回事，我就绝不会插手这样一件事情了。”","“And that is the truth,” said he.“I am fery prave myself, and pold as a lions.But to stand up there—and you ken naething of fence!—the way that you did, I declare it was peyond me.And I am sorry for the plow; though I declare I pelief your own was the elder brother, and my heid still sings with it.And I declare if I had kent what way it wass, I would not put a hand to such a piece of pusiness.”"
"“说得太好了，”我回答道，“我确信你是不会第二次站出来与我个人为敌了。”","“That is handsomely said,” I replied, “and I am sure you will not stand up a second time to be the actor for my private enemies.”"
"“的确不会，抛尔弗，”他说，“而且我觉得我已经受够了，就像安排我跟一个老太太决斗那样，居然安排我和一个小毛孩决斗！我会这么告诉主人的，要和他决斗，上帝作证，他自己去吧！”","“Indeed, no, Palfour,” said he; “and I think I was used extremely suffeeciently myself to be set up to fecht with an auld wife, or all the same as a bairn whateffer!And I will tell the Master so, and fecht him, by Cot, himself!”"
"“要是你了解西蒙先生和我争吵的原委，”我说，“你更会觉得掺和进这种事情是受侮辱。”","“And if you knew the nature of Mr. Simon’s quarrel with me,” said I, “you would be yet the more affronted to be mingled up with such affairs.”"
"他发誓他完全相信这一点，因为所有的洛瓦特族人都是一路货色，都是魔鬼打造出来的。然后他突然握起我的手，发誓说我毕竟非常够朋友，之前多有怠慢，遗憾万千，还说如果抽得出时间，他会亲自来监督我练剑。","He swore he could well believe it; that all the Lovats were made of the same meal and the devil was the miller that ground that; then suddenly shaking me by the hand, he vowed I was a pretty enough fellow after all, that it was a thousand pities I had been neglected, and that if he could find the time, he would give an eye himself to have me educated."
"“你可以帮我做一件更好的事，那胜过你打算做的事。”我说，当他问我究竟是何事时——“跟我一起去我的一个敌人家里，去证明我这一天是如何度过的。”我告诉他，“那才是真正的帮忙。因为虽然他第一次给我派来的是一位英勇的对手，但是西蒙先生脑子里想的只有谋杀。还会有第二次、第三次，而就凭你对我运用这柄钢剑的身手的了解，你自己可以判断结果会是什么样。”","“You can do me a better service than even what you propose,” said I; and when he had asked its nature—“Come with me to the house of one of my enemies, and testify how I have carried myself this day,” I told him.“That will be the true service.For though he has sent me a gallant adversary for the first, the thought in Mr. Simon’s mind is merely murder.There will be a second and then a third; and by what you have seen of my cleverness with the cold steel, you can judge for yourself what is like to be the upshot.”"
"“如果说我刚才不比你更像男子汉，我自己也不愿意那样的！”他叫道，“不过我会支持你的，抛尔弗。带路吧！”","“And I would not like it myself, if I was no more of a man than what you wass!” he cried.“But I will do you right, Palfour.Lead on!”"
"如果说我在来这该死的公园时走得很慢的话，那么出去时我的脚步非常轻快。对于时间，有一句老话说得好，那句话和《圣经》一样久远了，话是这么说的：“可以肯定死亡的痛苦已经过去。”我发现自己口很渴，就在路边一口名叫圣玛格丽特的水井处喝了水，井水甜得令人难以置信。我们穿过圣堂，走上卡农门，从内瑟堡旁进去，便直奔普雷斯顿格兰奇的家门，我们边走边谈，安排着我们要办事情的细节。门丁承认主人在家，但却宣称他正与其他绅士有私事商议，严禁入内。","If I had walked slowly on the way into that accursed park my heels were light enough on the way out.They kept time to a very good old air, that is as ancient as the Bible, and the words of it are: “Surely the bitterness of death is passed.”I mind that I was extremely thirsty, and had a drink at Saint Margaret’s well on the road down, and the sweetness of that water passed belief.We went through the sanctuary, up the Canongate, in by the Netherbow, and straight to Prestongrange’s door, talking as we came and arranging the details of our affair.The footman owned his master was at home, but declared him engaged with other gentlemen on very private business, and his door forbidden."
"“我的事情只需要三分钟，而且不能等，”我说，“你就说这绝不是什么私事，而且我也很高兴有一些见证人。”","“My business is but for three minutes, and it cannot wait,” said I.“You may say it is by no means private, and I shall be even glad to have some witnesses.”"
"当那人很不情愿地动身进去禀报此事时，我们便冒昧地跟着他到了接待室，在那里有一阵子我听到里间有几个不同的声音在喃喃低语。事实上，桌子边上有三个人——普雷斯顿格兰奇、西蒙·弗雷泽，还有珀斯的警长厄斯金先生。因为他们在商议的正是阿平凶杀案一事，所以我的出现有点儿打扰了他们，不过他们还是决定见我。","As the man departed unwillingly enough upon this errand, we made so bold as to follow him to the ante-chamber, whence I could hear for a while the murmuring of several voices in the room within.The truth is, they were three at the one table—Prestongrange, Simon Fraser, and Mr. Erskine, Sheriff of Perth; and as they were met in consultation on the very business of the Appin murder, they were a little disturbed at my appearance, but decided to receive me."
"“唷，唷！鲍尔弗先生，什么风又把你吹到这里来了？你带来的这个人是谁啊？”普雷斯顿格兰奇说。","“Well, well, Mr. Balfour, and what brings you here again? and who is this you bring with you?” says Prestongrange."
"至于弗雷泽，他则看着他面前的桌子。","As for Fraser, he looked before him on the table."
"“他到这里是给我帮忙来做个小小的证词，大人，我觉得您很有必要听一听。”我说完转向邓肯斯比。","“He is here to bear a little testimony in my favour, my lord, which I think it very needful you should hear,” said I, and turned to Duncansby."
"“我只能这么说，”中尉说，“今天在猎人沼泽我与抛尔弗发生了冲突，对此我现在还感到很抱歉，而他举止得体，完全符合一位绅士的要求。而且我非常尊重抛尔弗。”他补充说。","“I have only to say this,” said the lieutenant, “that I stood up this day with Palfour in the Hunter’s Pog, which I am now fery sorry for, and he behaved himself as pretty as a shentlemans could ask it.And I have creat respects for Palfour,” he added."
"“我谢谢您诚实的表述。”我说。","“I thank you for your honest expressions,” said I."
"于是邓肯斯比向大家鞠了个躬，然后按照我们先前商量好的离开了那个房间。","Whereupon Duncansby made his bow to the company, and left the chamber, as we had agreed upon before."
"“对此需要我怎么做？”普雷斯顿格兰奇说。","“What have I to do with this?” says Prestongrange."
"“我想对大人您说两句话，”我说，“我带来这位绅士，一位皇家军官，就是为了公平地为我作证。现在我认为我有性命之虞，除非大人您能为我提供很好的保护，他们再派军官来对付我才会徒劳无益。我不会同意和城堡里的驻守军人一路拼斗来开路的。”普雷斯顿格兰奇的额头上血管喷张，他狂怒地看着我。","“I will tell your lordship in two words,” said I.“I have brought this gentleman, a King’s officer, to do me so much justice.Now I think my character in covered, and until a certain date, which your lordship can very well supply, it will be quite in vain to despatch against me any more officers.I will not consent to fight my way through the garrison of the castle.”The veins swelled on Prestongrange’s brow, and he regarded me with fury."
"“这个混蛋居然在我的地盘放这个狗东西去咬人！”他喊道，猛然转身对着他旁边的人，“这是你干的好事，西蒙，”他说，“我看出是你插手这件事了，那么，让我告诉你，我讨厌你这样做。这是不忠实，我们一致商议好了一个计策的，你却暗地里另搞一套。你这是对我不忠！什么！你还让我的女儿们跟他一起去了那个地方！而正因为我向你透露了那么一两句……哎呀，先生，你这是自取其辱！”","“I think the devil uncoupled this dog of a lad between my legs!” he cried; and then, turning fiercely on his neighbour, “This is some of your work, Simon,” he said.“I spy your hand in the business, and, let me tell you, I resent it.It is disloyal, when we are agreed upon one expedient, to follow another in the dark.You are disloyal to me.What! you let me send this lad to the place with my very daughters!And because I let drop a word to you.....Fy, sir, keep your dishonours to yourself!”"
"西蒙脸色惨白。“我不再充当你和公爵之间踢的皮球了，”他叫喊道，“要么达成协议，要么分道扬镳，你们自己决定吧。但是我不再任由你们差遣，去听从你们互相矛盾的指示了，害得我两头受气。要是我告诉你我对你从事的所有汉诺威王朝事务的看法，那才会让你伤脑筋呢。”","Simon was deadly pale.“I will be a kick-ball between you and the Duke no longer,” he exclaimed.“Either come to an agreement, or come to a differ, and have it out among yourselves.But I will no longer fetch and carry, and get your contrary instructions, and be blamed by both.For if I were to tell you what I think of all your Hanover business it would make your head sing.”"
"不过厄斯金警长保持了冷静，现在他出面来打圆场了。“在这段时间，”他说，“我想我们应该告诉鲍尔弗先生他的性命确定会得到保障。他可以睡个安稳觉。直到有一天，他觉得足够安全，不再需要任何保障了。”","But Sheriff Erskine had preserved his temper, and now intervened smoothly.“And in the meantime,” says he, “I think we should tell Mr. Balfour that his character for valour is quite established.He may sleep in peace.Until the date he was so good as to refer to it shall be put to the proof no more.”"
"他的冷静使其他人都审慎起来，然后他们有点儿心不在焉却礼貌地匆匆打发我离开了那座房子。","His coolness brought the others to their prudence; and they made haste, with a somewhat distracted civility, to pack me from the house."
"第九章 怒火中烧","CHAPTER IX—THE HEATHER ON FIRE"
"那天下午离开普雷斯顿格兰奇家的时候，我头一次感到愤怒了。检察总长耍弄了我。他佯称我的证词会被接受，我本人也会受到尊重，可就在那同时，不仅西蒙在借高地军人之手图谋要我的命，而且普雷斯顿格兰奇本人（就像其话语中所流露的）也参与了行动谋划。我清点着我的敌人：普雷斯顿格兰奇有整个王室的权力做后盾；公爵有西部高地的权力；还有洛瓦特家族势力在并肩协助他们，洛瓦特家族在北部有极大的势力，还要算上所有老雅各比党人的间谍和商贩。当我想起詹姆斯·莫尔，还有邓肯的儿子红发尼尔的时候，我认为也许还有第四股同谋力量，就是罗布·罗伊老部落中那些铤而走险的山贼残部，他们也会和其他人联合起来对付我。有一样东西是必不可少的——就是要有非常强大的朋友或者智囊顾问。这个国家肯定有的是这种能干而热心，并且愿意支持我的人。或者洛瓦特、公爵和普雷斯顿格兰奇一直都还没有合谋出可行的计策。我一想到有可能在街上遇到前来挑衅的武士，而我却无计可施，就让我大为光火。","When I left Prestongrange that afternoon I was for the first time angry.The Advocate had made a mock of me.He had pretended my testimony was to be received and myself respected; and in that very hour, not only was Simon practising against my life by the hands of the Highland soldier, but (as appeared from his own language) Prestongrange himself had some design in operation.I counted my enemies; Prestongrange with all the King’s authority behind him; and the Duke with the power of the West Highlands; and the Lovat interest by their side to help them with so great a force in the north, and the whole clan of old Jacobite spies and traffickers.And when I remembered James More, and the red head of Neil the son of Duncan, I thought there was perhaps a fourth in the confederacy, and what remained of Rob Roy’s old desperate sept of caterans would be banded against me with the others.One thing was requisite—some strong friend or wise adviser.The country must be full of such, both able and eager to support me, or Lovat and the Duke and Prestongrange had not been nosing for expedients; and it made me rage to think that I might brush against my champions in the street and be no wiser."
"就在这时（像是一种回答）一位绅士从我身旁擦肩而过，他意味深长地看了我一眼，然后转身进了一个胡同。我从眼角的余光认出了他——那是斯图尔特大律师。我庆幸自己运气好，就拐进去跟在他的后面。我一进胡同就看见他站在一个楼梯口边，他朝我打了个手势就迅速消失了。我爬上七层楼后，他又一次出现在一间房门处，我们进去后他还朝我们背后望了望。这房子已清理一空，没有一点家具。实际上，这是斯图尔特手头的房产之一。","And just then (like an answer) a gentleman brushed against me going by, gave me a meaning look, and turned into a close.I knew him with the tail of my eye—it was Stewart the Writer; and, blessing my good fortune, turned in to follow him.As soon as I had entered the close I saw him standing in the mouth of a stair, where he made me a signal and immediately vanished.Seven storeys up, there he was again in a house door, the which he looked behind us after we had entered.The house was quite dismantled, with not a stick of furniture; indeed, it was one of which Stewart had the letting in his hands."
"“我们只能坐在地板上，”他说，“但是在这里我们暂时是安全的。我可是费了很大的劲才找到你，鲍尔弗先生。”","“We’ll have to sit upon the floor,” said he; “but we’re safe here for the time being, and I’ve been wearying to see ye, Mr. Balfour.”"
"“艾伦的事怎么样了？”我问。","“How’s it with Alan?” I asked."
"“很不错，”他说，“明天星期三，安迪会在吉兰沙滩接他。他很希望能跟你道个别，但是根据目前的情形，恐怕你们两个还是分开为好。现在我得谈谈关键的问题：你的事情进展如何？”","“Brawly,” said he.“Andie picks him up at Gillane sands to-morrow, Wednesday.He was keen to say good-bye to ye, but the way that things were going, I was feared the pair of ye was maybe best apart.And that brings me to the essential: how does your business speed?”"
"“唉！”我说，“今天早晨我才得知我的证词被采纳了，我会跟检察总长一起去因弗雷里，就这么多。”","“Why,” said I, “I was told only this morning that my testimony was accepted, and I was to travel to Inverary with the Advocate, no less.”"
"“去他的吧！”斯图尔特喊道，“我绝不相信。”","“Hout awa!” cried Stewart.“I’ll never believe that.”"
"“我自己也有一点儿怀疑，”我说，“但是我很想听听你的理由。”","“I have maybe a suspicion of my own,” says I, “but I would like fine to hear your reasons.”"
"“好，跟你直说吧，我气坏了，”斯图尔特叫道，“如果我单手就可以把政府打倒，我就会像摘烂苹果一样把它给拔掉。我是为阿平和格伦斯的詹姆斯做事的律师，当然，为同族的生命辩护是我的职责。听听我这边事情的进展情况吧，我会把它留给你自己来做判断的。他们要做的第一件事就是除掉艾伦。他们必须先把艾伦判为主犯，才能把詹姆斯判为共犯。那才合乎法律程序，他们不可能本末倒置的。”","“Well, I tell ye fairly, I’m horn-mad,” cries Stewart.“If my one hand could pull their Government down I would pluck it like a rotten apple.I’m doer for Appin and for James of the Glens; and, of course, it’s my duty to defend my kinsman for his life.Hear how it goes with me, and I’ll leave the judgment of it to yourself.The first thing they have to do is to get rid of Alan.They cannae bring in James as art and part until they’ve brought in Alan first as principal; that’s sound law: they could never put the cart before the horse.”"
"“那么在抓到艾伦之前他们会怎么宣判他呢？”我说。","“And how are they to bring in Alan till they can catch him?” says I."
"“哦，倒是有一个办法可以不经逮捕而定案，”他说，“也合乎法律程序。如果有一个嫌犯逃跑了，另一个就无法定罪，这对我们是好事情。但是也有补救的方法，就是传唤主犯出庭，然后认定他为没有共犯的罪犯。现在有四种地方可以传唤一个人出庭：在他的住宅；在他住过四十天的地方；在他平时常住州郡的主要市镇；或者最后（如果有充足的理由认定他会离开苏格兰的话）在爱丁堡的十字路口和利斯的码头和海岸处呆上六十天。最后这一条的意图再明显不过了：因为外出的船只可能有时间带回其偷渡的消息，那么这种传唤只是徒有形式罢了。现在来看看艾伦的案子。我从来没有听说他有住宅；要是有人能证明自1745年以后他居住时间超过四十天的地方，那就是我调查不力了；不论是平常还是特殊情况下都没有他常住的州郡；如果他真的有一个住所，我怀疑，那一定是和他的部队一起住在法国了；而如果说他还没有离开苏格兰的话（就像我们碰巧得知以及他们碰巧猜到的），那么很明显即使最迟钝的人都会知道他的目标会是什么了。那么，会在何地，以何种方式传唤他出庭呢？我想问问你这么一位外行。”","“Ah, but there is a way to evite that arrestment,” said he.“Sound law, too.It would be a bonny thing if, by the escape of one ill-doer another was to go scatheless, and the remeid is to summon the principal and put him to outlawry for the non-compearance.Now there’s four places where a person can be summoned: at his dwelling-house; at a place where he has resided forty days; at the head burgh of the shire where he ordinarily resorts; or lastly (if there be ground to think him forth of Scotland) at the cross of Edinburgh, and the pier and shore of Leith, for sixty days.The purpose of which last provision is evident upon its face: being that outgoing ships may have time to carry news of the transaction, and the summonsing be something other than a form.Now take the case of Alan.He has no dwelling-house that ever I could hear of; I would be obliged if anyone would show me where he has lived forty days together since the ’45; there is no shire where he resorts whether ordinarily or extraordinarily; if he has a domicile at all, which I misdoubt, it must be with his regiment in France; and if he is not yet forth of Scotland (as we happen to know and they happen to guess) it must be evident to the most dull it’s what he’s aiming for.Where, then, and what way should he be summoned?I ask it at yourself, a layman.”"
"“正让你说对了，”我说，“他就在十字路口，在利斯码头和海岸呆了六十天。”","“You have given the very words,” said I.“Here at the cross, and at the pier and shore of Leith, for sixty days.”"
"“那么，你比普雷斯顿格兰奇更像一位苏格兰的律师界人士！”那律师叫道，“他已经传唤过一次艾伦，那是在25号，就是我们最初会面的那一天。就一次，就这样结束了。在哪里？除了在因弗雷里的十字路口，坎贝尔家族的主要市镇，还会在哪里？跟你讲句悄悄话，鲍尔弗先生——他们并没有在寻找艾伦。”","“Ye’re a sounder Scots lawyer than Prestongrange, then!” cries the Writer.“He has had Alan summoned once; that was on the twenty-fifth, the day that we first met.Once, and done with it.And where?Where, but at the cross of Inverary, the head burgh of the Campbells?A word in your ear, Mr. Balfour—they’re not seeking Alan.”"
"“你这是什么意思？”我叫道，“没在寻找他？” ","“What do you mean?” I cried.“Not seeking him?”"
"“我尽可能把这件事解释清楚，”他说，“以我愚见，他们并不想找他。他们认为也许他可能已经做好防卫，而在其背后的詹姆斯可能会爬出来，那才是他们真正想钓的大鱼。这不是一个案子，你要明白，这是一个阴谋。” ","“By the best that I can make of it,” said he.“Not wanting to find him, in my poor thought.They think perhaps he might set up a fair defence, upon the back of which James, the man they’re really after, might climb out.This is not a case, ye see, it’s a conspiracy.”"
"“然而我可以告诉你普雷斯顿格兰奇曾经很急切地问起过艾伦。”我说，“尽管，当我回想此事时，他是有点儿像很随便地提到的。”","“Yet I can tell you Prestongrange asked after Alan keenly,” said I; “though, when I come to think of it, he was something of the easiest put by.”"
"“想一想那一点！”他说，“就是那里！我可能对也可能错，充其量也就是猜猜，让我再来说说我了解的事实。我听说詹姆斯以及那些证人——那些证人，鲍尔弗先生！都被关在地牢里，而且还上了镣铐，在威廉堡的军事监狱里。不允许任何人接近他们，也不准他们写信。那些证人啊，鲍尔弗先生，你听说过这种对待证人的做法吗？我向你保证，老练狡猾的斯图尔特族人是绝不会如此放肆地藐视法律的。很明显1700年法案对于非法监禁有两种不同的观点。我一得到消息就向法院副院长提出申请。今天我得到他的答复了。那就是给你们制定的法律！这就是公正！”","“See that!” says he.“But there!I may be right or wrong, that’s guesswork at the best, and let me get to my facts again.It comes to my ears that James and the witnesses—the witnesses, Mr. Balfour!—lay in close dungeons, and shackled forbye, in the military prison at Fort William; none allowed in to them, nor they to write.The witnesses, Mr. Balfour; heard ye ever the match of that?I assure ye, no old, crooked Stewart of the gang ever out-faced the law more impudently.It’s clean in the two eyes of the Act of Parliament of 1700, anent wrongous imprisonment.No sooner did I get the news than I petitioned the Lord Justice Clerk.I have his word to-day.There’s law for ye! here’s justice!”"
"他把一张纸塞进在我手里，正是那份委婉而虚伪的文件，是由“一位旁观者”印制成了小册子，为的是（如题所述）詹姆斯的“可怜的寡妇和五个孩子”的利益。","He put a paper in my hand, that same mealy-mouthed, false-faced paper that was printed since in the pamphlet “by a bystander,” for behoof (as the title says) of James’s “poor widow and five children.”"
"“看，”斯图尔特说，“我有权见我的委托人，他根本不敢拒绝，所以他就建议那指挥官让我进去。建议！苏格兰法院副院长提出建议。这句话的用意还不明显吗？ 他们希望那位军官可能会很迟钝，或者正好完全相反，拒绝这个建议。我就得再一次奔波往返于从这里到威廉堡之间的旅程。那么就会重新延期直到我得到新的批复，然后他们又叫那军官否决——军人嘛，一直有不懂法律的臭名声——我看出了其中的猫腻。随后又第三次奔波，一直到审判立刻就要开始的时候我才拿到了第一份指示。我把这称之为阴谋，难道不对吗？”","“See,” said Stewart, “he couldn’t dare to refuse me access to my client, so he recommends the commanding officer to let me in.Recommends!—the Lord Justice Clerk of Scotland recommends.Is not the purpose of such language plain?They hope the officer may be so dull, or so very much the reverse, as to refuse the recommendation.I would have to make the journey back again betwixt here and Fort William.Then would follow a fresh delay till I got fresh authority, and they had disavowed the officer—military man, notoriously ignorant of the law, and that—I ken the cant of it.Then the journey a third time; and there we should be on the immediate heels of the trial before I had received my first instruction.Am I not right to call this a conspiracy?”"
"“是带有阴谋的味道。”我说。","“It will bear that colour,” said I."
"“我将继续彻底地向你证明这一点。”他说，“他们有权把詹姆斯关在监狱里，然而他们没有权不准我去探访他。他们无权控制证人。而我有权去看他们，有权像法院副院长本人一样自由地去看他们！ 看看——读一读：‘至于其他，拒绝给监狱看守人员下命令，将不会被指控为犯有任何违背其职责的行为。’任何违背其职责的行为！先生！那1700年法案算什么？鲍尔弗先生，这简直把我的心脏都气炸了，真让人怒火中烧。”","“And I’ll go on to prove it you outright,” said he.“They have the right to hold James in prison, yet they cannot deny me to visit him.They have no right to hold the witnesses; but am I to get a sight of them, that should be as free as the Lord Justice Clerk himself!See—read: For the rest, refuses to give any orders to keepers of prisons who are not accused as having done anything contrary to the duties of their office.Anything contrary!Sirs!And the Act of seventeen hunner?Mr. Balfour, this makes my heart to burst; the heather is on fire inside my wame.”"
"“用通俗的话来说，”我说，“就是那些证人仍然还呆在监狱里，而你还见不到他们？”","“And the plain English of that phrase,” said I, “is that the witnesses are still to lie in prison and you are not to see them?”"
"“我要一直等到在因弗雷里开庭的时候才能见到他们！”他叫道，“而且接着还要听普雷斯顿格兰奇吹嘘他如何恪尽职守以及如何为辩护提供最大的方便！但是我到时也要耍弄耍弄他们才是，戴维先生。我有个计划就是在路上拦截证人，看看是否能够从枉顾法律而声名狼籍的军人那里讨回一丝公正，那样说不定能控制局面。”","“And I am not to see them until Inverary, when the court is set!” cries he, “and then to hear Prestongrange upon the anxious responsibilities of his office and the great facilities afforded the defence!But I’ll begowk them there, Mr. David.I have a plan to waylay the witnesses upon the road, and see if I cannae get I a little harle of justice out of the military man notoriously ignorant of the law that shall command the party.”"
"事实正是如此——事实上在靠近廷内顿的路边，靠一位军官给予了方便，斯图尔特先生才第一次见到了这宗案子的那些证人。","It was actually so—it was actually on the wayside near Tynedrum, and by the connivance of a soldier officer, that Mr. Stewart first saw the witnesses upon the case."
"“这起案件里没有比这更让我吃惊的事了。”我说。","“There is nothing that would surprise me in this business,” I remarked."
"“还有更让你吃惊的！”他叫道，“你看见这个了吗？”他指着一份刚印刷出来的墨迹未干的材料，“这就是原告的诉状：看，在证人名单里有普雷斯顿格兰奇的大名，可我却找不到任何和鲍尔弗有关的字眼。但是这还不是问题所在。你认为是谁为印制这份诉状买的单呢？”","“I’ll surprise you ere I’m done!” cries he.“Do ye see this?”—producing a print still wet from the press.“This is the libel: see, there’s Prestongrange’s name to the list of witnesses, and I find no word of any Balfour.But here is not the question.Who do ye think paid for the printing of this paper?”"
"“我想有可能是乔治国王。”我说。","“I suppose it would likely be King George,” said I."
"“但是却恰恰是我！”他叫道，“他们不只是自己为自己、为格兰特们和厄斯金们印制，还为那个黑夜里的窃贼——西蒙·弗雷泽印制。但是我能顺利拿到一份副本吗？根本不能！我到要辩护的时候都还被蒙在鼓里，我要到庭上才会第一次听到陪审团的指控。”","“But it happens it was me!” he cried.“Not but it was printed by and for themselves, for the Grants and the Erskines, and yon thief of the black midnight, Simon Fraser.But could I win to get a copy!No!I was to go blindfold to my defence; I was to hear the charges for the first time in court alongst the jury.”"
"“这不是有悖于法律吗？”我问。","“Is not this against the law?”I asked."
"“我不能说太多。”他回答，“我能够这么自然、坚持不懈地提出诉求（直到这桩前所未有的官司结束）已经够意思了，这件事从来就没指望过法律。现在，感谢上帝的眷顾！有个陌生人在弗莱明的印刷厂看到了地板上的一份校样，就捡起来并带给了我。真没想到，那就是这份原告的诉状。于是我将它再次付印——由被告方付费重印。由被告方付费，听说过有这样的人吗？但是只有这样方可以对所有人揭开一个惊天的秘密——所有人都会看到的。可是你想想吧，我怎么会喜欢这样做呢？这可关系到我的同族亲戚的性命。”","“I cannot say so much,” he replied.“It was a favour so natural and so constantly rendered (till this nonesuch business) that the law has never looked to it.And now admire the hand of Providence!A stranger is in Fleming’s printing house, spies a proof on the floor, picks it up, and carries it to me.Of all things, it was just this libel.Whereupon I had it set again—printed at the expense of the defence: sumptibus moesti rei; heard ever man the like of it?—and here it is for anybody, the muckle secret out—all may see it now.But how do you think I would enjoy this, that has the life of my kinsman on my conscience?”"
"“的确，我觉得你不会喜欢那么做的。”我说。","“Troth, I think you would enjoy it ill,” said I."
"“现在你清楚是怎么回事了，”他总结道，“也清楚为什么你说你的证据被采纳时，我对着你大笑不已了。” ","“And now you see how it is,” he concluded, “and why, when you tell me your evidence is to be let in, I laugh aloud in your face.”"
"现在轮到我说了。我简要地跟他说了下西蒙先生的威胁和提议，遭遇刺客的整件事，以及随后在普雷斯顿格兰奇家所见的情景。对于我的第一次谈话，按照我作出的承诺，我只字未提，实际上也没有必要提。在我说话的时候，斯图尔特一个劲地点着头，就像一个机器人。我的声音一停，他就开口说两句话提出他的建议，并详述其利弊。","It was now my turn.I laid before him in brief Mr. Simon’s threats and offers, and the whole incident of the bravo, with the subsequent scene at Prestongrange’s.Of my first talk, according to promise, I said nothing, nor indeed was it necessary.All the time I was talking Stewart nodded his head like a mechanical figure; and no sooner had my voice ceased, than he opened his mouth and gave me his opinion in two words, dwelling strong on both of them."
"“你自行失踪吧。”他说。","“Disappear yourself,” said he."
"“我不明白你的意思。”我说。","“I do not take you,” said I."
"“那么让我给你说明白，”他说，“以我的观点来看，你是无论如何都要失踪的。哦，那是不容争辩的。那位检察总长也不是一点不顾法律，他已经从西蒙和公爵的手中保全了你的性命。他已经拒绝送你去受审判，也拒绝派人杀你。这就有迹象说明他们的意见不一致，因为西蒙和公爵不论是对朋友还是对敌人都不讲信用。那么你就不会受审讯，而且也不会被谋害。但是如果你没有像格兰奇夫人那样被绑架给带走的话，那就是我大错特错了。咱们可以打赌，这就是他们的如意算盘！”","“Then I’ll carry you there,” said he.“By my view of it you’re to disappear whatever.O, that’s outside debate.The Advocate, who is not without some spunks of a remainder decency, has wrung your life-safe out of Simon and the Duke.He has refused to put you on your trial, and refused to have you killed; and there is the clue to their ill words together, for Simon and the Duke can keep faith with neither friend nor enemy.Ye’re not to be tried then, and ye’re not to be murdered; but I’m in bitter error if ye’re not to be kidnapped and carried away like the Lady Grange.Bet me what ye please—there was their expedient!”"
"“你让我想起来了。”我说，并且告诉了他有关那口哨声和红头发的家臣尼尔之事。","“You make me think,” said I, and told him of the whistle and the red-headed retainer, Neil."
"“哪里有詹姆斯·莫尔，哪里就会有个大无赖，这绝不是骗你的。”他说，“他的父亲虽然犯了法，倒还没有这么坏。他父亲不是我家的朋友，我也犯不着浪费唇舌为他辩护！但是说到詹姆斯，他就是一个卑鄙小人，一个牛皮客。我和你一样都不喜欢红发尼尔的样子。他样子古怪，呸！气味也难闻。格兰奇夫人一事正是老洛瓦特处理的，要是再让年轻的洛瓦特处理你的案子，那就全都由这个家族给包揽了。詹姆斯·莫尔为什么会进监狱？同样的罪名：诱拐。他的手下已经做过这种买卖。他将把他的手下借给西蒙充当其工具，接下来我们听到的事情将会是：詹姆斯已经讲和了，或者是他已经逃跑了。而你将会被弄到本贝丘拉岛或者艾普克罗斯岛去。”","“Wherever James More is there’s one big rogue, never be deceived on that,” said he.“His father was none so ill a man, though a kenning on the wrong side of the law, and no friend to my family, that I should waste my breath to be defending him!But as for James he’s a brock and a blagyard.I like the appearance of this red-headed Neil as little as yourself.It looks uncanny: fiegh! it smells bad.It was old Lovat that managed the Lady Grange affair; if young Lovat is to handle yours, it’ll be all in the family.What’s James More in prison for?The same offence: abduction.His men have had practice in the business.He’ll be to lend them to be Simon’s instruments; and the next thing we’ll be hearing, James will have made his peace, or else he’ll have escaped; and you’ll be in Benbecula or Applecross.”"
"“你分析得很有道理。”我表示认可。","“Ye make a strong case,” I admitted."
"“而我想要的，”他接着说，“是在他们动手对付你之前，你自己先失踪。在审判开始前销声匿迹，直到他们不再寻找你的时候，你在最后一刻突然出现在他们面前。鲍尔弗先生，这都是假设，其前提是你的证据的确值得如此大费周章地冒险和劳神。”","“And what I want,” he resumed, “is that you should disappear yourself ere they can get their hands upon ye.Lie quiet until just before the trial, and spring upon them at the last of it when they’ll be looking for you least.This is always supposing Mr. Balfour, that your evidence is worth so very great a measure of both risk and fash.”"
"“我要告诉你一件事，”我说，“我看到了杀人凶手，但不是艾伦。”","“I will tell you one thing,” said I.“I saw the murderer and it was not Alan.”"
"“那么，上帝保佑，我的本家兄弟得救了！”斯图尔特叫道，“他的性命就在于你怎么说了，而且离带你上庭没剩下多少时间，冒不起什么风险，也浪费不起金钱了。”他在地板上倒空了口袋。“这是我身上所有的东西。”他继续说道，“拿着它，你在事情结束前需要的。径直沿此胡同而下，那里有一条路出去可到长堤道。照我的意愿去做！在这场冲突结束以前不要再来爱丁堡！”","“Then, by God, my cousin’s saved!” cried Stewart.“You have his life upon your tongue; and there’s neither time, risk, nor money to be spared to bring you to the trial.”He emptied his pockets on the floor.“Here is all that I have by me,” he went on, “Take it, ye’ll want it ere ye’re through.Go straight down this close, there’s a way out by there to the Lang Dykes, and by my will of it!see no more of Edinburgh till the clash is over.”"
"“那么，我应该去哪里呢？”我询问道。","“Where am I to go, then?” I inquired."
"“我要是能告诉你就好了！”他说，“但是我能送你去的所有地方，都是他们能够找得到的地方。不，你必须自己去找，上帝会给你指引方向的！在审判前五天，9月16日，到斯特灵的‘皇家军械’捎句话给我。如果这么久的时间你都自己设法安排好了的话，你一定会赶到因弗雷里的。”","“And I wish that I could tell ye!” says he, “but all the places that I could send ye to, would be just the places they would seek.No, ye must fend for yourself, and God be your guiding!Five days before the trial, September the sixteen, get word to me at the King Arms in Stirling; and if ye’ve managed for yourself as long as that, I’ll see that ye reach Inverary.”"
"“还有一件事，”我说，“难道我不能见艾伦一面吗？”","“One thing more,” said I.“Can I no see Alan?”"
"他似乎有点儿踌躇。“嗨，我宁愿你不要去见面。”他说，“不过我不能否认艾伦非常渴望见到你，他今夜有意在银磨坊歇脚。如果你确信没有被跟踪的话，鲍尔弗先生——可一定要确保这一点——在你冒险见他之前先找个合适的地方花上一个小时把你的路探好。要是你和他一旦有什么闪失，那这事就完蛋了！” ","He seemed boggled.“Hech, I would rather you wouldnae,” said he.“But I can never deny that Alan is extremely keen of it, and is to lie this night by Silvermills on purpose.If you’re sure that you’re not followed, Mr. Balfour—but make sure of that—lie in a good place and watch your road for a clear hour before ye risk it.It would be a dreadful business if both you and him was to miscarry!”"
"第十章　红发人","CHAPTER X - THE RED-HEADED MAN"
"我走到长堤道上时大约是三点半。迪安村是我想去的地方。因为卡特里奥娜就住在那里。不过看样子几乎就可以肯定她的亲戚格伦盖尔·麦格雷戈家的人肯定是反对我的，所以迪安村本应该是少数几个我躲得远远的地方之一。但是我还很年轻，又初次深坠爱河，于是我毫不犹豫就转身朝那个方向走去。但是，良心和常识支配着我采取了一项预防措施。快要走到斜坡路的顶部时，我突然飞快地卧倒在大麦地里，躺在那里等着。过了一会儿，一个高地人相貌的男子走了过来，但是在那一刻之前我还从来没有见过他。不久红发尼尔也走过来了。接下来走过的是一辆磨坊的运货车，在那之后就只有一些显然是乡下人的人走过。再鲁莽的人也应该从这里打道回府了，但是我非常不想这么做。我为自己辩解说，看到尼尔走在这条路上没什么不对的，因为这条路通向他首领女儿的家。至于另一个高地人，如果我看到每一个高地人都害怕的话，那我就哪里都去不成了。因为对自己虚伪的辩解颇感满意，我加快了速度，才四点刚过就来到了德拉蒙德·奥格尔维夫人家。","It was about half-past three when I came forth on the Lang Dykes. Dean was where I wanted to go. Since Catriona dwelled there, and her kinsfolk the Glengyle Macgregors appeared almost certainly to be employed against me, it was just one of the few places I should have kept away from; and being a very young man, and beginning to be very much in love, I turned my face in that direction without pause. As a slave to my conscience and common sense, however, I took a measure of precaution. Coming over the crown of a bit of a rise in the road, I clapped down suddenly among the barley and lay waiting.After a while, a man went by that looked to be a Highlandman, but I had never seen him till that hour. Presently after came Neil of the red head. The next to go past was a miller’s cart, and after that nothing but manifest country people. Here was enough to have turned the most foolhardy from his purpose, but my inclination ran too strong the other way. I argued it out that if Neil was on that road, it was the right road to find him in, leading direct to his chief’s daughter; as for the other Highlandman, if I was to be startled off by every Highlandman I saw, I would scarce reach anywhere. And having quite satisfied myself with this disingenuous debate, I made the better speed of it, and came a little after four to Mrs. Drumond-Ogilvy’s."
"两位女士都在房里。门开着，我一看到她们就摘下帽子说道：“这里有一位小伙子来要他的六个便士。”我以为这样可以取悦那位老贵妇。","Both ladies were within the house; and upon my perceiving them together by the open door, I plucked off my hat and said, “Here was a lad come seeking saxpence,” which I thought might please the dowager."
"卡特里奥娜热情地跑出来和我打招呼，而令我惊讶的是，那位老太太似乎没有朝前挪动一下。过了很久以后我才知道她那天白天曾派遣一位骑士去过昆斯费里的兰基勒家，她知道兰基勒是肖斯家的律师。当时她的口袋里就有一封我那位好友写的信，那封信以极为赞赏的态度介绍了我的品性和前途。不过当时就算我看了那封信，也还是弄不清楚她打的什么算盘。也许我是一个乡巴佬，但我并不像她想得那么乡里乡气。就凭我这点平庸的智慧，都看出了她是在倾力策划，想把她的本家亲戚和一个在洛锡安地区算是个领主的无须小子撮合成一对。","Catriona ran out to greet me heartily, and, to my surprise, the old lady seemed scarce less forward than herself. I learned long afterwards that she had despatched a horseman by daylight to Rankeillor at the Queensferry, whom she knew to be the doer for Shaws, and had then in her pocket a letter from that good friend of mine, presenting, in the most favourable view, my character and prospects. But had I read it I could scarce have seen more clear in her designs. Maybe I was COUNTRYFEED; at least, I was not so much so as she thought; and it was even to my homespun wits, that she was bent to hammer up a match between her cousin and a beardless boy that was something of a laird in Lothian. "
"“六便士最好来和我们一起喝些肉汤。卡特里奥娜，”她说，“快去告诉那些女仆。”","“Saxpence had better take his broth with us, Catrine,” says she. “Run and tell the lasses.”"
"在我们单独相处的短暂时间里，她搜肠刮肚找话来奉承我。她一直处理得很巧妙，总是一副逗乐的样子，仍然叫我六便士，可是在我看来她只是在利用这样的时机抬捧我。卡特里奥娜返回后，她的这种意图越发明显，她夸耀那女孩的种种优点就像是马贩子在推销马匹一样。她竟然会把我看得那么愚钝，我不由得脸发红了。我想象着那位女孩无辜地被丢人现眼，恨不能用棍棒狠揍那老太婆一顿。我又想到，也许是她们两个合伙设计套我，那么一想我就闷闷不乐地坐在她们之间，一副意兴阑珊的模样。最后那位媒婆终于想到了一个更好的主意，就是留下我们两个单独呆在一起。我的疑虑一旦被激起，有时候就有点儿难以缓解。不过尽管我知道她是什么血统，那可是山贼的血统，但是我绝不可能直视卡特里奥娜的脸而去怀疑她。","And for the little while we were alone was at a good deal of pains to flatter me; always cleverly, always with the appearance of a banter, still calling me Saxpence, but with such a turn that should rather uplift me in my own opinion. When Catriona returned, the design became if possible more obvious; and she showed off the girl’s advantages like a horse-couper with a horse. My face flamed that she should think me so obtuse.Now I would fancy the girl was being innocently made a show of, and then I could have beaten the old carline wife with a cudgel; and now, that perhaps these two had set their heads together to entrap me, and at that I sat and gloomed betwixt them like the very image of ill-will. At last the matchmaker had a better device, which was to leave the pair of us alone. When my suspicions are anyway roused it is sometimes a little the wrong side of easy to allay them. But though I knew what breed she was of, and that was a breed of thieves, I could never look in Catriona’s face and disbelieve her."
"“我不能问问吗？”我们刚一被单独留下，她就很急切地说道。","“I must not ask?” says she, eagerly, the same moment we were left alone."
"“啊，不过今天我可以由着良心说话，”我回答，“我已不受我的誓言约束了，而实际上（自从早上陆续发生一些事情之后）即使有人问起，我也不会再重述它了。”","“Ah, but to-day I can talk with a free conscience,” I replied. “I am lightened of my pledge, and indeed (after what has come and gone since morning) I would not have renewed it were it asked.” "
"“告诉我吧，”她说，“我的本家亲戚不会出去多久的。”","“Tell me,” she said. “My cousin will not be so long.” "
"于是我就把那个中尉的故事从头到尾说给她听了，并且尽可能说得轻松愉快一些。不过，说真的，那件事虽然荒谬，但还是有些好笑的。","So I told her the tale of the lieutenant from the first step to the last of it, making it as mirthful as I could, and, indeed, there was matter of mirth in that absurdity."
"“毕竟，我认为你不适合跟那些粗鲁的男人在一起，就像你不适合跟那几位漂亮的淑女在一起一样。”我讲完之后，她说，“但是你父亲怎么就不能教你剑术啊！这是最没有教养的，我还从来没有听说过那样的比赛。”","“And I think you will be as little fitted for the rudas men as for the pretty ladies, after all!” says she, when I had done. “But what was your father that he could not learn you to draw the sword! It is most ungentle; I have not heard the match of that in anyone.”"
"“至少这是最不像话的，”我说，“我想我父亲（诚实的人！）肯定是一时心血来潮就教我学习拉丁文而没有教我学剑了。可是你看我已经尽力了，只不过我像罗德的妻子一样呆站在那里任由他们捶打罢了。”","“It is most misconvenient at least,” said I; “and I think my father (honest man!) must have been wool-gathering to learn me Latin in the place of it. But you see I do the best I can, and just stand up like Lot’s wife and let them hammer at me.” "
"“你知道是什么让我笑了吗？”她说，“咳，是这么回事。我就是这样给带大的，就是说，我本应该是个男孩子。在我自己的思想里，我一直就是一个男孩。我不断地告诉自己这件事一定会发生之类的。然后就到了要上战场去战斗的时候了，于是我又想到无论如何我只是一个女孩，是不可能拿起刀剑或者给人致命一击的，所以我只好把我的故事扭转过来，这样就可以让战斗停止，而我却依然占尽了上风，就像你和那位中尉。我就是那个一直侃侃而谈，说得天花乱坠的男孩，就像戴维·鲍尔弗先生一样。”","“Do you know what makes me smile?” said she.  “Well, it is this. I am made this way, that I should have been a man child. In my own thoughts it is so I am always; and I go on telling myself about this thing that is to befall and that.Then it comes to the place of the fighting, and it comes over me that I am only a girl at all events, and cannot hold a sword or give one good blow; and then I have to twist my story round about, so that the fighting is to stop, and yet me have the best of it, just like you and the lieutenant; and I am the boy that makes the fine speeches all through, like Mr. David Balfour.”"
"“你是一个残忍的少女。”我说。","“You are a bloodthirsty maid,” said I."
"“嗯，我知道自己最好去缝缝衣服，纺纺纱，还有就是去绣绣花。”她说，“可是如果你在这个大千世界不做一点儿其他的事，我想你自己都会说这太没意思了。我觉得，并不是我想杀人。你曾经杀过什么人吗？”","“Well, I know it is good to sew and spin, and to make samplers,” she said, “but if you were to do nothing else in the great world, I think you will say yourself it is a driech business; and it is not that I want to kill, I think. Did ever you kill anyone?” "
"“我杀过，纯属偶然。两个，就这么多吧，当时我还是个应该在大学读书的年轻人。”我说，“但是，回想过去，我并不为此感到羞愧。”","“That I have, as it chances. Two, no less, and me still a lad that should be at the college,” said I. “But yet, in the look-back, I take no shame for it.” "
"“那么，你当时感觉如何——就是杀人以后？”她问道。","“But how did you feel, then—after it?” she asked."
"“实际上，我坐下来，像个小孩一样哭泣了起来。”我说。","“Deed, I sat down and grat like a bairn,” said I."
"“我也了解那一点，”她叫道，“我感觉得出眼泪是从哪里流出来的。无论如何，我不想杀人，只是没料到凯瑟琳·道格拉斯竟然会伸出手臂穿过门闩上的U型大钉，结果她的手臂断了。那就是我的主要英雄事迹了。难道你不愿意这样去死——就是为国王而死吗？”她问道。","“I know that, too,” she cried. “I feel where these tears should come from. And at any rate, I would not wish to kill, only to be Catherine Douglas that put her arm through the staples of the bolt, where it was broken. That is my chief hero.Would you not love to die so—for your king?” she asked. "
"“我发誓，”我说，“我对国王的崇敬非常有限，上帝保佑他那张肥脸。我想今天我已经看到了死亡如此逼近，所以我宁愿接受生存这个想法。”","“Troth,” said I, “my affection for my king, God bless the puggy face of him, is under more control; and I thought I saw death so near to me this day already, that I am rather taken up with the notion of living.” "
"“对，”她说，“一个真正男子汉的正确思想！只是你必须学会用兵器。我可不愿意有个不会打斗的朋友。可是你也不可能是拿剑杀了他们两个的吧？”","“Right,” she said, “the right mind of a man! Only you must learn arms; I would not like to have a friend that cannot strike.But it will not have been with the sword that you killed these two?”"
"“的确不是，”我说，“而是用了两把手枪。幸运的是那两个人距离我很近，因为我用手枪并不比我用剑灵活。”","“Indeed, no,” said I, “but with a pair of pistols.And a fortunate thing it was the men were so near-hand to me, for I am about as clever with the pistols as I am with the sword.”"
"于是她接着要求我讲了我们在双桅船上的战斗经历，那是我在第一次叙述自己的事情时省略了的。","So then she drew from me the story of our battle in the brig, which I had omitted in my first account of my affairs."
"“是啊，”她说，“你很勇敢。还有你的朋友，我钦佩他，也喜欢他。”","“Yes,” said she, “you are brave. And your friend, I admire and love him.”"
"“嗯，我认为任何人都会这样！”我说，“他像其他人一样有缺点，但他勇敢、坚定而且友善，上帝保佑他！我要有一天忘记艾伦那就奇怪了。”一想起他，想起那天晚上我将有机会和他交谈，我几乎激动不已。","“Well, and I think anyone would!” said I. “He has his faults like other folk; but he is brave and staunch and kind, God bless him! That will be a strange day when I forget Alan.”And the thought of him, and that it was within my choice to speak with him that night, had almost overcome me. "
"“我这脑袋瓜想到哪里去了，居然还没有告诉你我的消息呢！”她叫道，然后说起她父亲写了一封信，意思是她明天可以去城堡看望他，他才转到那里，而且他的事情正在好转。“你不喜欢听到这个消息，”她说，“你还不了解我父亲就对他作出判断吗？”","“And where will my head be gone that I have not told my news!” she cried, and spoke of a letter from her father, bearing that she might visit him to-morrow in the castle whither he was now transferred, and that his affairs were mending. “You do not like to hear it,” said she.  “Will you judge my father and not know him?” "
"“我离作出判断还有一千英里远呢，”我回答，“我向你保证看到你心情轻松我真的很高兴。如果我的脸色垮下来了，我想一定是这样的，请你谅解，今天对我来说是心情很恶劣的一天，因为我不得不向那些极端邪恶的当权人物妥协。我内心对西蒙·弗雷泽仍然非常反感。”","“I am a thousand miles from judging,” I replied.“And I give you my word I do rejoice to know your heart is lightened. If my face fell at all, as I suppose it must, you will allow this is rather an ill day for compositions, and the people in power extremely ill persons to be compounding with.I have Simon Fraser extremely heavy on my stomach still.”"
"“啊！”她叫道，“你可不能把这两个人等同视之。你要记住普雷斯顿格兰奇和詹姆斯·莫尔，我的父亲，是同一个血统。”","“Ah!” she cried, “you will not be evening these two; and you should bear in mind that Prestongrange and James More, my father, are of the one blood.”"
"“我还从未听说这一点。”我说。","“I never heard tell of that,” said I."
"“真奇怪你居然知道得这么少。”她说，“一个分支自称为格兰特，另一个则叫麦格雷戈，但他们仍然是同一宗族的。他们都是阿尔平的后代，我想我们国家的名称就源于此。”","“It is rather singular how little you are acquainted with,” said she.“One part may call themselves Grant, and one Macgregor, but they are still of the same clan. They are all the sons of Alpin, from whom, I think, our country has its name.”"
"“那是什么国家？”我问。","“What country is that?” I asked."
"“是我的国家，也是你的国家。”她说。","“My country and yours.” said she."
"“我认为，今天是我有了新发现的日子，”我说，“因为我一直都认为它的名字就是苏格兰。”","“This is my day for discovering I think,” said I, “for I always thought the name of it was Scotland.”"
"“苏格兰是你们给爱尔兰起的名字，”她回答说，“但是我们脚踏的这个地方，我们繁衍生息的这个地方，其远古的真正名称就是奥尔本。当我们的祖先与罗马和亚历山大为之交战时，他们就称之为奥尔本了。而且在你自己的语言里它还是这么称呼的，只是你忘记了而已。”","“Scotland is the name of what you call Ireland,” she replied.“But the old ancient true name of this place that we have our foot-soles on, and that our bones are made of, will be Alban.It was Alban they called it when our forefathers will be fighting for it against Rome and Alexander; and it is called so still in your own tongue that you forget.” "
"“我发誓，”我说，“我从来就不知道！”因为我无心让她对古马其顿人加以解释。 ","“Troth,” said I, “and that I never learned!” For I lacked heart to take her up about the Macedonian."
"“但是你的祖祖辈辈都谈起过它，一代传一代。”她说，“你我还在摇篮里时就听着这哼唱入眠的，甚至连你的名字都还记忆着它。啊，如果你会讲那种语言，你会发现我简直就变成另一个女孩了。那种语言才能诉说心声。”","“But your fathers and mothers talked it, one generation with another,” said she.“And it was sung about the cradles before you or me were ever dreamed of; and your name remembers it still.Ah, if you could talk that language you would find me another girl. The heart speaks in that tongue.”"
"我和这两位女士一起用餐，一切都很精致，用的是古色古香的餐具，葡萄酒也特别醇香，奥格尔维夫人似乎很富有。我们的谈话也非常愉快。但是我一看到太阳急速落下，阴影拉得长长的，我就起身告辞了。因为我脑子里想着要去和艾伦道别的事。我有必要趁着天色还早去看看约见的树林，而且得实地侦查侦查。卡特里奥娜一直把我送到了花园门口。","I had a meal with the two ladies, all very good, served in fine old plate, and the wine excellent, for it seems that Mrs. Ogilvy was rich.Our talk, too, was pleasant enough; but as soon as I saw the sun decline sharply and the shadows to run out long, I rose to take my leave. For my mind was now made up to say farewell to Alan; and it was needful I should see the trysting wood, and reconnoitre it, by daylight. Catriona came with me as far as to the garden gate."
"“要很久才能再见到你了？”她问。","“It is long till I see you now?” she asked."
"“这我就无法断定了，”我回答，“也许很久，也可能永远见不着了。”","“It is beyond my judging,” I replied.“It will be long, it may be never.”"
"“也许是这样吧，”她说，“那你觉得难过吗？”","“It may be so,” said she. “And you are sorry?”"
"我低下头，看着她。","I bowed my head, looking upon her."
"“无论如何，我也一样。”她说，“我虽然见你的时间很短，但是对你评价却很高。你为人真诚、勇敢，我认为到时你会更像一个男子汉的。听到那个消息，我将会很骄傲。如果事态加速恶化，如果事情像我们担心的那样降临了——哦，好吧！我认为你还有唯一的一个朋友。在你死了很久之后，我也成为老太婆了，我将给小孩子们讲关于戴维·鲍尔弗的故事，一边讲一边流泪。我将会告诉他们我们是怎样分别的，我对你说过的话以及我对你做过的事。‘愿上帝保佑并指引你，为你这个小朋友而祈祷’——我会这么说——我将会告诉他们——而这就是我要做的。”","“So am I, at all events,” said she.“I have seen you but a small time, but I put you very high.You are true, you are brave; in time I think you will be more of a man yet.I will be proud to hear of that.If you should speed worse, if it will come to fall as we are afraid—O well. I think you have the one friend.Long after you are dead and me an old wife, I will be telling the bairns about David Balfour, and my tears running.I will be telling how we parted, and what I said to you, and did to you.GOD GO WITH YOU AND GUIDE YOU, PRAYS YOUR LITTLE FRIEND: so I said—I will be telling them—and here is what I did.”"
"她拿起我的手并亲吻了一下。这极大地震撼了我的心灵，我像是受伤了一样叫出声来。她满脸凝重之色，看着我并点点头。","She took up my hand and kissed it.This so surprised my spirits that I cried out like one hurt.The colour came strong in her face, and she looked at me and nodded."
"“哦，是的，戴维先生，”她说，“那就是我对你的想法。我的想法是伴随着这嘴唇的。”","“O yes, Mr. David,” said she, “that is what I think of you. The head goes with the lips.”"
"从她的脸上我能看出她情绪高昂，就像一个富有骑士精神的勇敢的孩子，此外再无其他。她吻了我的手，就像她曾经吻查理王子的手那样，带着一种激情，比普通人的感情更加炽热。在这以前还没有什么能让我明白她爱我有多深，也没有什么能让我知晓我还得攀登多远才能让她如是看待我。然而我可以告诉自己我已经有所前进，她的心已经因为想到我而怦然跳动，她的血液也为此而奔涌流动。","I could read in her face high spirit, and a chivalry like a brave child’s; not anything besides.She kissed my hand, as she had kissed Prince Charlie’s, with a higher passion than the common kind of clay has any sense of.Nothing before had taught me how deep I was her lover, nor how far I had yet to climb to make her think of me in such a character. Yet I could tell myself I had advanced some way, and that her heart had beat and her blood flowed at thoughts of me."
"在她给我如此殊荣之后，我再也无法保持那微不足道的矜持了。我甚至难以开口说话。她声音略微提高，打开了我泪水的闸门。","After that honour she had done me I could offer no more trivial civility.It was even hard for me to speak; a certain lifting in her voice had knocked directly at the door of my own tears."
"“亲爱的，因为你的仁慈，我赞美主，”我说，“再见，我的小朋友！”我用她称呼自己的方式称呼她，说完我弯腰示意，然后离开了她。","“I praise God for your kindness, dear,” said I. “Farewell, my little friend!” giving her that name which she had given to herself; with which I bowed and left her. "
"我沿利斯河谷向下，前往斯托克布里奇和银磨坊。一条小路在河谷脚下延伸，水流潺潺，在峡谷中吟唱。阳光突然从西边的重重阴影中当头照下，这样（在峡谷转弯时）每一个转角处都会是一幅新的景象和一个崭新的世界。想到身后有卡特里奥娜，前方有艾伦，我就像受到了极大的鼓舞。身边这个地方，以及这个时刻，还有河水的倾诉，都使我感到无尽的愉悦。我悠然漫步，边走边前顾后看。正因为此，简直是天意呀，我居然发觉我后面不远的灌木丛中有一个红色的脑袋。","My way was down the glen of the Leith River, towards Stockbridge and Silvermills.A path led in the foot of it, the water bickered and sang in the midst; the sunbeams overhead struck out of the west among long shadows and (as the valley turned) made like a new scene and a new world of it at every corner. With Catriona behind and Alan before me, I was like one lifted up.The place besides, and the hour, and the talking of the water, infinitely pleased me; and I lingered in my steps and looked before and behind me as I went. This was the cause, under Providence, that I spied a little in my rear a red head among some bushes."
"我内心冒火，径直转身，用比较僵硬的步伐朝来路走回。小路就紧靠在我注意到那个脑袋的灌木丛旁边。灌木覆盖到了路边，所以我在经过的时候高度紧张，准备着迎敌和抵抗袭击。可是这样的事情并没有发生，我没有受到任何阻拦，因此我内心的恐惧更甚。实际上当时天色还亮，但是那个地方格外偏僻。如果跟踪我的人居然放弃那么好的时机，那我就可以断定他们的目标不仅仅是我戴维·鲍尔弗了。艾伦和詹姆斯的性命沉甸甸地压在我的心头，就像压着两头长大了的牛犊子那么沉重。","Anger sprang in my heart, and I turned straight about and walked at a stiff pace to where I came from.The path lay close by the bushes where I had remarked the head.The cover came to the wayside, and as I passed I was all strung up to meet and to resist an onfall. No such thing befell, I went by unmeddled with; and at that fear increased upon me.It was still day indeed, but the place exceeding solitary.If my haunters had let slip that fair occasion I could but judge they aimed at something more than David Balfour.The lives of Alan and James weighed upon my spirit with the weight of two grown bullocks."
"卡特里奥娜还在花园里独自散步。","Catriona was yet in the garden walking by herself."
"“卡特里奥娜，”我说，“你看我又回来了。”","“Catriona,” said I, “you see me back again.”"
"“可是脸色变了。”她说。","“With a changed face,” said she."
"“除自己之外，我手头还攥着两个人的性命，”我说，“要是不小心行事就会是罪恶和耻辱。我怀疑我到这里来是否做对了。如果那样做会给我们带来伤害，我就不愿意了。”","“I carry two men’s lives besides my own,” said I.“It would be a sin and shame not to walk carefully. I was doubtful whether I did right to come here.I would like it ill, if it was by that means we were brought to harm.”"
"“那我可以告诉你有个人更不愿意，而且也很不愿意听你此刻的这种说法，”她叫道，“不管怎么说，我做了什么？”","“I could tell you one that would be liking it less, and will like little enough to hear you talking at this very same time,” she cried. “What have I done, at all events?” "
"“哦，你……我……你并不是独自一个人。”我回答道，“但是自从我一离开我就又被跟踪了,而且我都说得出是谁在跟踪我。就是尼尔，邓肯的儿子，你的手下或者说是你父亲的手下。”","“O, you I you are not alone,” I replied.“But since I went off I have been dogged again, and I can give you the name of him that follows me. It is Neil, son of Duncan, your man or your father’s.”"
"“肯定是你弄错了，”她说，脸色发白，“尼尔现在正在爱丁堡听我父亲的差遣呢。”","“To be sure you are mistaken there,” she said, with a white face. “Neil is in Edinburgh on errands from my father.” "
"“这正是我所担心的,”我说，“最担心的。不过既然他在爱丁堡，我想我可以让你见见另一个尼尔。可以肯定你们有某种联络信号，一个需要帮助的信号，比如可以叫他过来帮助你，只要他在耳力和腿力可达范围之内？”“什么，你怎么知道的？”她说。","“It is what I fear,” said I, “the last of it.But for his being in Edinburgh I think I can show you another of that.For sure you have some signal, a signal of need, such as would bring him to your help, if he was anywhere within the reach of ears and legs?”“Why, how will you know that?” says she."
"“是上帝在我出生时通过一种神奇的护身符方式给我的，其名称就是人们所称的常识。”我说，“只要你能按我的要求发个信号，我就会让你看到红头发尼尔。”","“By means of a magical talisman God gave to me when I was born, and the name they call it by is Common-sense,” said I.“Oblige me so far as make your signal, and I will show you the red head of Neil.”"
"无疑我当时说的话尖酸又刻薄。我的内心也很痛苦。我既责备自己也责怪那个女孩，而且也讨厌我们两个人：讨厌她是因为她出身于卑鄙无耻的群体，讨厌我自己则是因为我糊里糊涂就荒唐地捅了这样一个马蜂窝。","No doubt but I spoke bitter and sharp. My heart was bitter. I blamed myself and the girl and hated both of us: her for the vile crew that she was come of, myself for my wanton folly to have stuck my head in such a byke of wasps."
"卡特里奥娜把手指放在唇边吹了一声口哨，声调特别嘹亮、有力、高昂，像足了一个犁田的农夫吹的口哨。我们沉默着站了一会儿，我正要让她再吹一声时，突然听到山坡边下面的灌木丛里有人冲过的声音。我微笑着朝那个方向指去，不久尼尔就跳进了花园。他目光如炬，而且手里握着一把出鞘的黑刀（高地那边的人这么称呼），但是，看见我站在他的女主人身边，他就像受到了打击一样呆住了。","Catriona set her fingers to her lips and whistled once, with an exceeding clear, strong, mounting note, as full as a ploughman’s.A while we stood silent; and I was about to ask her to repeat the same, when I heard the sound of some one bursting through the bushes below on the braeside.I pointed in that direction with a smile, and presently Neil leaped into the garden. His eyes burned, and he had a black knife (as they call it on the Highland side) naked in his hand; but, seeing me beside his mistress, stood like a man struck."
"“他已经按照你的呼唤过来了，”我说，“你判断一下他离爱丁堡有多近，或者你父亲派给他的是什么性质的差事吧。问问他自己。如果通过你们家族的手段，我得丧失性命，或者得失去那些悬在我身上的性命，那么就让我睁大眼睛去我必须去的地方吧。”","“He has come to your call,” said I, “judge how near he was to Edinburgh, or what was the nature of your father’s errands.Ask himself. If I am to lose my life, or the lives of those that hang by me, through the means of your clan, let me go where I have to go with my eyes open.”"
"她声音颤抖地用盖尔语对他讲话。那一刻我想起了艾伦渴望待人有礼，否则我可能就会因心痛而大声笑出来了。此时，的确，在此疑虑重重之际，是她本应该说英语的时刻。","She addressed him tremulously in the Gaelic.Remembering Alan’s anxious civility in that particular, I could have laughed out loud for bitterness; here, sure, in the midst of these suspicions, was the hour she should have stuck by English."
"他们一起交谈了两三句，我看得出尼尔（虽然他极力谄媚）生气了。","Twice or thrice they spoke together, and I could make out that Neil (for all his obsequiousness) was an angry man."
"然后她转向我说：“他发誓说不是那么回事。”","Then she turned to me. “He swears it is not,” she said. "
"“卡特里奥娜，”我说，“你自己相信这个人吗？”","“Catriona,” said I, “do you believe the man yourself?”"
"她做出像是绞着手的姿势。","She made a gesture like wringing the hands."
"“我怎么可能知道？”她叫喊道。","“How will I can know?” she cried."
"“但是我必须想办法弄清楚，”我说，“我身上拴着两个人的性命，我不能继续在黑夜里瞎转悠！卡特里奥娜，你设身处地从我的情形想想，我对上帝发誓我是尽力为你着想了。这根本不是一场在你我之间应该进行的谈话，根本就不是这种谈话，我的内心为此很难受。你看，你就把他留在这里直到凌晨两点吧，之后我就无所谓了。那样来试一试他。”","“But I must find some means to know,” said I.“I cannot continue to go dovering round in the black night with two men’s lives at my girdle!Catriona, try to put yourself in my place, as I vow to God I try hard to put myself in yours.This is no kind of talk that should ever have fallen between me and you; no kind of talk; my heart is sick with it. See, keep him here till two of the morning, and I care not.Try him with that.”"
"他们再次用盖尔语说了起来。","They spoke together once more in the Gaelic."
"“他说他还得办我父亲詹姆斯·莫尔的差事。”她说。她的脸色比之前更惨白，说话的时候她的声音在颤抖。","“He says he has James More my father’s errand,” said she.She was whiter than ever, and her voice faltered as she said it."
"“现在已经相当清楚了，”我说，“但愿上帝饶恕恶人！”","“It is pretty plain now,” said I, “and may God forgive the wicked!”"
"对此她没再说任何话，只是脸色煞白地继续凝视着我。","She said never anything to that, but continued gazing at me with the same white face."
"“这是一笔好生意，”我又说道，“要是我完了，那么，那两个人也会随我一起完蛋吗？”","“This is a fine business,” said I again. “Am I to fall, then, and those two along with me?”"
"“哦，我该怎么办？”她叫道，“我能反抗我父亲的命令吗？他在监狱里，他的性命有危险！”","“O, what am I to do?” she cried. “Could I go against my father’s orders, him in prison, in the danger of his life!”"
"“不过也许我们结论下得太快了，”我说，“这可能也是谎言。他可能没有直接下命令，这一切都是西蒙谋划的，你父亲对此一无所知。”","“But perhaps we go too fast,” said I. “This may be a lie too. He may have no right orders; all may be contrived by Simon, and your father knowing nothing.”"
"就我们俩时，她突然哭了起来，我的内心很是自责，因为我想到这个女孩处境很糟糕。","She burst out weeping between the pair of us; and my heart smote me hard, for I thought this girl was in a dreadful situation."
"“那么，”我说，“只拖延他一个小时，我碰碰运气，愿上帝保佑你。”","“Here,” said I, “keep him but the one hour; and I’ll chance it, and may God bless you.”"
"她向我伸出手，呜咽着说：“我需要说好话。”","She put out her hand to me, “I will he needing one good word,” she sobbed. "
"“那么，整整一个小时？”我说，把她的手握在我的手心里，“三条性命，我的姑娘！”“整整一个小时！”她说，并大声哭出来以求救世主原谅她。","“The full hour, then?” said I, keeping her hand in mine. “Three lives of it, my lass!”“The full hour!” she said, and cried aloud on her Redeemer to forgive her."
"我认为那个地方不能再呆下去了，于是逃离了。","I thought it no fit place for me, and fled. "
"第十一章　银磨坊附近的树林","CHAPTER XI—THE WOOD BY SILVERMILLS"
"我没有浪费时间，而是尽快向下穿越山谷，经过斯托克布里奇到达银磨坊附近。我与艾伦约在每晚十二点到两点之间，在“银磨坊东边和南边水磨坊以南的一小片矮树林”里见面。我轻轻松松就找到了这个地方，那片树林在一个陡峭的斜坡上，水磨坊的水沿着深深的山脚快速地流动着。在这里我开始放慢脚步，更加理智地考虑所要办的事情。我明白我和卡特里奥娜做了一桩愚蠢的交易。我不该想着只派了尼尔一个人跟踪我，不过也许他是唯一属于詹姆斯·莫尔的人。在这种情况下，我本该竭尽全力送卡特里奥娜的父亲上绞架才是，而不应该做对我自己没有丝毫益处的事情。说实话，这些想法我一个都不喜欢。假设拖住了尼尔，那女孩就帮忙把她父亲送上了绞架，我认为这一次她永远都不会原谅她自己了。再假设那一刻还有其他人在跟踪我，那么我又会给艾伦带去怎样的一份礼物？那我又该如何是好呢？","I lost no time, but down through the valley and by Stockbridge and Silvermills as hard as I could stave.It was Alan’s tryst to be every night between twelve and two “in a bit scrog of wood by east of Silvermills and by south the south mill-lade.”This I found easy enough, where it grew on a steep brae, with the mill-lade flowing swift and deep along the foot of it; and here I began to walk slower and to reflect more reasonably on my employment.I saw I had made but a fool’s bargain with Catriona.It was not to be supposed that Neil was sent alone upon his errand, but perhaps he was the only man belonging to James More; in which case I should have done all I could to hang Catriona’s father, and nothing the least material to help myself.To tell the truth, I fancied neither one of these ideas.Suppose by holding back Neil, the girl should have helped to hang her father, I thought she would never forgive herself this side of time.And suppose there were others pursuing me that moment, what kind of a gift was I come bringing to Alan? and how would I like that?"
"我向上爬到树林的西头时，这两种想法就像给了我当头一棒。我的脚步不由地停了下来，我的心也慢慢静了下来。“我一直在玩着多么疯狂的游戏呀？”我想着，立即转身拔腿向别处跑去。 ","I was up with the west end of that wood when these two considerations struck me like a cudgel.My feet stopped of themselves and my heart along with them.“What wild game is this that I have been playing?” thought I; and turned instantly upon my heels to go elsewhere."
"这样以来，我就面朝银磨坊了。小路弯弯曲曲穿越村庄，一切都是那么清晰可见，高地和低地上都没有人。这里的地形对我有利，这正是斯图尔特曾建议我要把握的关键地形。于是我沿着水磨坊边上跑过去，在树林东边的角落处兜了个圈子，从树林中穿梭而过，然后返回到西面的树林边。我从那里再次俯视小路，仍然可以确信没有人看见自己。路上依然空无一人，我的心情开始好起来。","This brought my face to Silvermills; the path came past the village with a crook, but all plainly visible; and, Highland or Lowland, there was nobody stirring.Here was my advantage, here was just such a conjuncture as Stewart had counselled me to profit by, and I ran by the side of the mill-lade, fetched about beyond the east corner of the wood, threaded through the midst of it, and returned to the west selvage, whence I could again command the path, and yet be myself unseen.Again it was all empty, and my heart began to rise."
"我在靠近树林边缘处坐了一个多小时，甚至连野兔和老鹰都看不到。我刚开始坐下的时候，太阳就已经落山了，只不过天空仍然一片金黄，天色也还明亮。过了将近一个小时，天色就若明若暗了，种种影像和远景融合在一起，观察开始变得费力起来。所有这段时间里没有一个人从银磨坊向东走来，零零星星向西走去的几个人都是回家路上的一些乡下夫妻。就算我被欧洲最狡猾的间谍跟踪，我也认为我的藏身之处非同寻常，他们是不会知道我在哪里的。我稍走几步进入小树林，然后躺下来等候艾伦。","For more than an hour I sat close in the border of the trees, and no hare or eagle could have kept a more particular watch.When that hour began the sun was already set, but the sky still all golden and the daylight clear; before the hour was done it had fallen to be half mirk, the images and distances of things were mingled, and observation began to be difficult.All that time not a foot of man had come east from Silvermills, and the few that had gone west were honest countryfolk and their wives upon the road to bed.If I were tracked by the most cunning spies in Europe, I judged it was beyond the course of nature they could have any jealousy of where I was: and going a little further home into the wood I lay down to wait for Alan."
"之前我的注意力高度集中，因为我不只是注视着小路，还要注视视野内每一处灌木丛和田野。现在那一切都结束了。月亮，正是上弦月，在树林中微微闪光，周围一片乡村的寂静。我仰面躺着，接下来的三、四个小时，我正好有机会好好回顾一下自己的行为。","The strain of my attention had been great, for I had watched not the path only, but every bush and field within my vision.That was now at an end.The moon, which was in her first quarter, glinted a little in the wood; all round there was a stillness of the country; and as I lay there on my back, the next three or four hours, I had a fine occasion to review my conduct."
"首先有两件事对我来说很明显：那天我不该去迪安村，而且（去了那里之后）又不该现在躺在此处。这里（艾伦要来的地方）只不过是整个辽阔的苏格兰的一片小树林，但是一切正常的感觉都让我觉得这片小树林对我是封闭的，我承认我仍然停留在对自己感到茫然的状态。我想到了就在当天晚上我对卡特里奥娜所采取的做法。我曾如何空谈我所身负的两条性命，并以此来强迫她置自己的父亲于危险之中。而现在，我又在这里暴露他们的行踪，这似乎做得太过分了。一分良知需要八分勇气。对自己行为的自负感刚一消失，我就觉得自己好像是被解除武装之后站在一群恐怖分子当中。我突然坐了起来。要是我现在去找普雷斯顿格兰奇，在他睡觉之前找到他（我还是可以轻易做到的），然后彻底屈服，那会怎么样呢？谁会责备我呢？斯图尔特大律师不会，我只要对他说自己被跟踪了，完全没有信心能够无罪，所以就屈服了。卡特里奥娜也不会，现在我也已经准备好怎么回答了，就说我无法忍受她去出卖她的父亲。那么，瞬间我就可以放下所有这一切麻烦了，毕竟这一切确实与我毫不相干。我可以洗清在阿平凶杀案中的嫌疑，摆脱这块土地上所有斯图尔特族人和坎贝尔族人、所有辉格党人和托利党人的攻击；从此按照自己的意愿生活，能够享受并善用自己的财产，而且用部分青春时光来追求卡特里奥娜。那才是更为恰当的活法，胜过现在像贼一样被追得躲躲藏藏、逃跑奔命，还要被跟踪追捕，甚至还得再一次开始和艾伦一起逃亡的那种悲惨命运。","Two things became plain to me first: that I had no right to go that day to Dean, and (having gone there) had now no right to be lying where I was.This (where Alan was to come) was just the one wood in all broad Scotland that was, by every proper feeling, closed against me; I admitted that, and yet stayed on, wondering at myself.I thought of the measure with which I had meted to Catriona that same night; how I had prated of the two lives I carried, and had thus forced her to enjeopardy her father’s; and how I was here exposing them again, it seemed in wantonness.A good conscience is eight parts of courage.No sooner had I lost conceit of my behaviour, than I seemed to stand disarmed amidst a throng of terrors.Of a sudden I sat up.How if I went now to Prestongrange, caught him (as I still easily might) before he slept, and made a full submission?Who could blame me?Not Stewart the Writer; I had but to say that I was followed, despaired of getting clear, and so gave in.Not Catriona: here, too, I had my answer ready; that I could not bear she should expose her father.So, in a moment, I could lay all these troubles by, which were after all and truly none of mine; swim clear of the Appin Murder; get forth out of hand-stroke of all the Stewarts and Campbells, all the Whigs and Tories, in the land; and live henceforth to my own mind, and be able to enjoy and to improve my fortunes, and devote some hours of my youth to courting Catriona, which would be surely a more suitable occupation than to hide and run and be followed like a hunted thief, and begin over again the dreadful miseries of my escape with Alan."
"起初，我对这种投降根本没有觉得羞耻，只是为自己没有早一点儿想到并且这样去做而感到吃惊。于是我开始探寻发生这种变化的种种原因。我把这归因于我卑贱的灵魂，由此回溯到我最近的鲁莽言行，而那又是因为那种常见的、陈旧的、众所周知的、任意妄为而缺乏思考的原罪。我的脑海中立刻浮现出这句话：“撒旦怎么会驱逐撒旦呢？”什么？（我认为）我曾经因为任性放纵的缘故，走上追逐享乐的路，经历过年轻女孩的诱惑，完全厌倦过自己的品德，还曾危及过詹姆斯和艾伦的生命？难道我必须走我进来时的老路才能寻求出路？不行，由任意妄为带来的伤害就只能由克己来治愈，我曾放纵的肉身必须被钉死在十字架上。我环顾周围，找寻着我最不愿走的道路：也就是还没有等到见艾伦就离开树林，再一次在黑暗中，在纷乱而危险的命运中独自前行。","At first I thought no shame of this capitulation; I was only amazed I had not thought upon the thing and done it earlier; and began to inquire into the causes of the change.These I traced to my lowness of spirits, that back to my late recklessness, and that again to the common, old, public, disconsidered sin of self-indulgence.Instantly the text came in my head, “How can Satan cast out Satan?”What? (I thought) I had, by self-indulgence; and the following of pleasant paths, and the lure of a young maid, cast myself wholly out of conceit with my own character, and jeopardised the lives of James and Alan?And I was to seek the way out by the same road as I had entered in?No; the hurt that had been caused by self-indulgence must be cured by self-denial; the flesh I had pampered must be crucified.I looked about me for that course which I least liked to follow: this was to leave the wood without waiting to see Alan, and go forth again alone, in the dark and in the midst of my perplexed and dangerous fortunes."
"我非常详细地叙述这段心路历程，是因为我认为它可以起一些效用，可以让那些年轻人引以为戒。不过（都说）种菜园都有其道理，甚至在伦理道德和宗教信仰方面也有常识存在的余地。现在已经接近艾伦到的时刻了，月亮已经落下。要是我离开的话（因为我不可能大大方方地对跟踪我的密探吹口哨），他们可能会在黑暗中错过我，却误打误撞地抓住了艾伦。要是我留下，我至少可以充当我朋友的警卫，关键时刻可以提供救援。因为自己的任意妄为，我已经害得其他人身处险境。那么现在仅仅为了赎罪而逃跑，就会再一次置他们于危险之中，那未免也太不够理性了。因此，我还没有起身就又坐了下来，但是精神状况已经不同了，我对自己刚才的软弱感到惊奇，同样也为自己目前的沉着冷静而感到欣喜。","I have been the more careful to narrate this passage of my reflections, because I think it is of some utility, and may serve as an example to young men.But there is reason (they say) in planting kale, and even in ethic and religion, room for common sense.It was already close on Alan’s hour, and the moon was down.If I left (as I could not very decently whistle to my spies to follow me) they might miss me in the dark and tack themselves to Alan by mistake.If I stayed, I could at the least of it set my friend upon his guard which might prove his mere salvation.I had adventured other peoples’ safety in a course of self-indulgence; to have endangered them again, and now on a mere design of penance, would have been scarce rational.Accordingly, I had scarce risen from my place ere I sat down again, but already in a different frame of spirits, and equally marvelling at my past weakness and rejoicing in my present composure."
"不久灌木丛中传来一阵劈啪声。我把嘴贴近地面，学着艾伦的样子吹了一两声口哨。传来一声应答口哨，略带警惕的音调，很快我们在黑暗中碰到一起了。","Presently after came a crackling in the thicket.Putting my mouth near down to the ground, I whistled a note or two, of Alan’s air; an answer came in the like guarded tone, and soon we had knocked together in the dark."
"“你终于来了，戴维？”他低声说。","“Is this you at last, Davie?” he whispered."
"“正是本人。”我说。","“Just myself,” said I."
"“天哪，伙计，为了见你我可都等烦了！”他说，“这段时间对我来说再漫长不过了。每天，我只能藏身在一堆干草中，连自己的十个手指头都看不清楚，然后又在这里等你两个小时，可你老是不来！哎呀，你来得也还算恰逢其时，陪我一起到早晨吧！早晨？我在说什么呀？到那一天，我的意思是。”","“God, man, but I’ve been wearying to see ye!” says he.“I’ve had the longest kind of a time.A’ day, I’ve had my dwelling into the inside of a stack of hay, where I couldnae see the nebs of my ten fingers; and then two hours of it waiting here for you, and you never coming!Dod, and ye’re none too soon the way it is, with me to sail the morn!The morn? what am I saying?—the day, I mean.”"
"“唉，艾伦，好家伙，就到那一天，一定。”我说，“现在已经过了十二点了，的确，白天一到你就要起航了。在你面前的可是一条漫漫长路啊。”","“Ay, Alan, man, the day, sure enough,” said I.“It’s past twelve now, surely, and ye sail the day.This’ll be a long road you have before you.”"
"“首先，我们得分开好长一段时间。”他说。","“We’ll have a long crack of it first,” said he."
"“嗯，确实，而我还有很多的话要说给你听。”我说。","“Well, indeed, and I have a good deal it will be telling you to hear,” said I."
"于是我告诉了他一些要紧的事情，说得相当混乱，不过到说完的时候还算说清楚了。他一直听我说，很少问问题，时不时一副开心的样子笑一笑。他的笑声（最重要的是在那里，在黑暗中，我们谁也看不见谁）特别友善，浸润着我的心田。","And I told him what behooved, making rather a jumble of it, but clear enough when done.He heard me out with very few questions, laughing here and there like a man delighted: and the sound of his laughing (above all there, in the dark, where neither one of us could see the other) was extraordinary friendly to my heart."
"“唉，戴维，你真是个奇怪的家伙，”我讲完后他说道，“归根到底就是一个奇怪的捣蛋鬼，我从没想过会遇到像你这样的人。至于你所说的，普雷斯顿格兰奇像你自己一样是个辉格党，所以我不能不说说他了。哎呀！如果你真能信任他的话，我认为他就是你最好的朋友。但是西蒙·弗雷泽和詹姆斯·莫尔是我们自己家族的畜牲，而他们只配我给他们的这种称呼。黑色大恶魔就是弗雷泽家的父亲，人人都知道这一点。至于说格里格拉人，自打我蹒跚学步时就无法容忍他们的恶臭。我记得，我曾把一个人的鼻子弄出了血，我两腿还摇摇晃晃走不稳时就曾在那人的头顶上撒过尿。那天我父亲感到很骄傲，上帝让他安息吧！我认为他是知道原因的。我永远都不会否认罗宾是个不错的风笛手，”他补充说，“可是说到詹姆斯·莫尔，在我看来是魔鬼在指引他！”","“Ay, Davie, ye’re a queer character,” says he, when I had done: “a queer bitch after a’, and I have no mind of meeting with the like of ye.As for your story, Prestongrange is a Whig like yoursel’, so I’ll say the less of him; and, dod!I believe he was the best friend ye had, if ye could only trust him.But Simon Fraser and James More are my ain kind of cattle, and I’ll give them the name that they deserve.The muckle black deil was father to the Frasers, a’body kens that; and as for the Gregara, I never could abye the reek of them since I could stotter on two feet.I bloodied the nose of one, I mind, when I was still so wambly on my legs that I cowped upon the top of him.A proud man was my father that day, God rest him! and I think he had the cause.I’ll never can deny but what Robin was something of a piper,” he added; “but as for James More, the deil guide him for me!”"
"“有一件事我们不得不考虑，”我说，“查尔斯·斯图尔特说对了还是说错了？他们只是在跟踪我，还是在跟踪我们两个？”","“One thing we have to consider,” said I.“Was Charles Stewart right or wrong?Is it only me they’re after, or the pair of us?”"
"“那你自己有什么看法？你也是个有那么多经验的人了。”他说。","“And what’s your ain opinion, you that’s a man of so much experience?” said he."
"“我不知道。”我说。","“It passes me,” said I."
"“我也不知道。”艾伦说，“你认为这位姑娘会对你守信吗？”他问道。","“And me too,” says Alan.“Do ye think this lass would keep her word to ye?” he asked."
"“我是那么认为的。”我说。","“I do that,” said I."
"“嗯，那就没有什么好说的了。”他说，“而且无论如何，那都已经过去并结束了，他将不得不随他们一道走完剩下的漫长旅途了。”","“Well, there’s nae telling,” said he.“And anyway, that’s over and done: he’ll be joined to the rest of them lang syne.”"
"“你认为他们会有多少人呢？”我问。","“How many would ye think there would be of them?” I asked."
"“那得看情况了。”艾伦说，“如果只是跟踪你的话，他们可能会派两三个精力旺盛、身手敏捷、年轻力壮的小喽啰；而如果他们认为我会现身此事的话，我猜想会派十到十二个人吧。”他说。","“That depends,” said Alan.“If it was only you, they would likely send two-three lively, brisk young birkies, and if they thought that I was to appear in the employ, I daresay ten or twelve,” said he."
"那也没有用，我轻声笑起来。","It was no use, I gave a little crack of laughter."
"“而且我认为你会亲眼看见我把围在身边的那么多人，或者双倍的人都给打跑，几乎是近身肉搏！”他叫道。","“And I think your own two eyes will have seen me drive that number, or the double of it, nearer hand!” cries he."
"“没有那么多人，”我说，“因为我这一次已经把他们给彻底甩掉了。”","“It matters the less,” said I, “because I am well rid of them for this time.”"
"“毫无疑问那只是你的看法，”他说，“但是如果他们猫在这小树林里候着，我也丝毫不以为奇。你要明白，戴维伙计，他们可是高地佬。 我在想，有一些是弗雷泽人，还有一些是格里格拉人。我从不否认他们双方都有人，尤其格里格拉人是既聪明又富有经验。有个人赶着一群畜牲（说是）穿过低地的乡间走了十英里才发现着黑装的军人也许是在追踪他，他这时才明白了那么一点点。我正是从这里学会了敏锐地观察。 你没必要告诉我，这比战争要好，战争才是最好的，不过，总体上来说那都只是无用之举。现在格里格拉人已经采取了重大行动。”","“Nae doubt that’s your opinion,” said he; “but I wouldnae be the least surprised if they were hunkering this wood.Ye see, David man; they’ll be Hieland folk.There’ll be some Frasers, I’m thinking, and some of the Gregara; and I would never deny but what the both of them, and the Gregara in especial, were clever experienced persons.A man kens little till he’s driven a spreagh of neat cattle (say) ten miles through a throng lowland country and the black soldiers maybe at his tail.It’s there that I learned a great part of my penetration.And ye need nae tell me: it’s better than war; which is the next best, however, though generally rather a bauchle of a business.Now the Gregara have had grand practice.”"
"“无疑那是我受的教育上所缺失的部分。”我说。","“No doubt that’s a branch of education that was left out with me,” said I."
"“不过我在你身上经常可以看到这种痕迹。”艾伦说，“但是对你们这种接受了大学教育的人来说，这是件很奇怪的事情：你很天真，而且你也弄不明白。希腊语和希伯来语对我来说就像天书。可是，伙计呀，我知道我不懂这两种语言——但他们是有区别的。现在，你在这里。你腹部着地趴在这树林的躲藏处，你告诉我你已经甩开这些弗雷泽的人和麦格雷戈的人了。为什么？因为你说你看不见他们了。你这傻瓜，那可是他们的谋生之道啊。”","“And I can see the marks of it upon ye constantly,” said Alan.“But that’s the strange thing about you folk of the college learning: ye’re ignorat, and ye cannae see ‘t.Wae’s me for my Greek and Hebrew; but, man, I ken that I dinnae ken them—there’s the differ of it.Now, here’s you.Ye lie on your wame a bittie in the bield of this wood, and ye tell me that ye’ve cuist off these Frasers and Macgregors.Why?Because I couldnae see them, says you.Ye blockhead, that’s their livelihood.”"
"“做最坏的打算，”我说，“我们该做什么？”","“Take the worst of it,” said I, “and what are we to do?”"
"“我也在想同样的问题，”他说，“我们可能难以脱身。这不大对我的口味，至于其他的，我也有理由反对。首先，现在天已经很黑，仅靠人为努力我们就能彻底摆脱他们了。如果我们要一起走，就只能排成一条线；如果我们分开行动，我们就要把他们分成两半，就更有可能把跟踪你的这些绅士甩掉几个。接下来，第二步，如果他们还在跟踪我们，还是一副志在必得的样子，戴维，那么我承认我会乐于张开羽翼保护你，我认为让我代替你来受攻击可能还好一些。所以，照我的方法做，接下来我们不能再呆在树林里，而要偷偷溜出去，奔向东部的吉兰，我要到那里去找我的船。这就像过去的日子又要延续了，戴维，而且（时间就要到了）我们得想想你该怎么办。我很难受，在你需要我时却要把你留在这里。”","“I am thinking of that same,” said he.“We might twine.It wouldnae be greatly to my taste; and forbye that, I see reasons against it.First, it’s now unco dark, and it’s just humanly possible we might give them the clean slip.If we keep together, we make but the ae line of it; if we gang separate, we make twae of them: the more likelihood to stave in upon some of these gentry of yours.And then, second, if they keep the track of us, it may come to a fecht for it yet, Davie; and then, I’ll confess I would be blythe to have you at my oxter, and I think you would be none the worse of having me at yours.So, by my way of it, we should creep out of this wood no further gone than just the inside of next minute, and hold away east for Gillane, where I’m to find my ship.It’ll be like old days while it lasts, Davie; and (come the time) we’ll have to think what you should be doing.I’m wae to leave ye here, wanting me.”"
"“那么，我就跟你一起走吧！”我说，“你是要回你曾经呆过的地方吗？”","“Have with ye, then!” says I.“Do ye gang back where you were stopping?”"
"“正是担心这一点！”艾伦说，“他们对我很不错，不过我认为，如果再次看见我英俊的面庞，他们还是会非常失望的。因为（就像时间的流逝）我已不再是你所称呼的受欢迎的客人了。这样一来，我就更渴望能有你为伴，肖斯的戴维·鲍尔弗先生，你一定要振作起来！ 说到要在这树林里给查尔斯·斯图尔特留下两个记号，自从那天我们在科斯托芬山分别后，我就分不清黑夜与白天了。”","“Deil a fear!” said Alan.“They were good folks to me, but I think they would be a good deal disappointed if they saw my bonny face again.For (the way times go) I amnae just what ye could call a Walcome Guest.Which makes me the keener for your company, Mr. David Balfour of the Shaws, and set ye up!For, leave aside twa cracks here in the wood with Charlie Stewart, I have scarce said black or white since the day we parted at Corstorphine.”"
"说着他便从隐蔽的地方起身，随后我们开始悄悄地穿过树林向东移动。","With which he rose from his place, and we began to move quietly eastward through the wood."
"第十二章 再次和艾伦一起踏上逃亡之路","CHAPTER XII—ON THE MARCH AGAIN WITH ALAN"
"大概是一到两点钟吧，月亮（正如我说过的）已经下山了。一阵稍稍强劲的风裹着一块浓重的残云突然降临在西边。我们在漆黑的夜里开始了行动，这黑夜正是逃亡者或者凶手所需要的。小路泛出的白光指引着我们来到沉睡中的布劳顿镇，从那里穿过皮卡第，然后从我的老相识、吊在绞架上的那两个小偷身旁经过。稍远之处，我们发现一座有用的灯塔，那是洛克黑德一扇高高在上的窗户中透出的灯光。凭借灯光的引导，不过很多时候我们都是随意乱走的，我们还是踩坏了一些要收获的庄稼。我们就这么跌跌撞撞地沿着田埂而下，一路穿越田野，终于顺利来到了人们称为菲盖特温斯的连绵沼泽地带。在这里，在荆豆丛下，我们拥着残余的夜色躺下睡了。","It was likely between one and two; the moon (as I have said) was down; a strongish wind, carrying a heavy wrack of cloud, had set in suddenly from the west; and we began our movement in as black a night as ever a fugitive or a murderer wanted.The whiteness of the path guided us into the sleeping town of Broughton, thence through Picardy, and beside my old acquaintance the gibbet of the two thieves.A little beyond we made a useful beacon, which was a light in an upper window of Lochend.Steering by this, but a good deal at random, and with some trampling of the harvest, and stumbling and falling down upon the banks, we made our way across country, and won forth at last upon the linky, boggy muirland that they call the Figgate Whins.Here, under a bush of whin, we lay down the remainder of that night and slumbered."
"大约五点，黎明唤醒了我们。那是一个美丽的早晨，强劲的西风依然猛烈地吹着，但是所有的云块都已经被吹向了欧洲大陆。 艾伦已经坐起来自顾自地在微笑着。自打我们分开后，这还是我第一次看清我的朋友，我愉快地抬头看着他。他的背上依旧披着那件长长的大衣，不过（新的东西就是）他现在穿着一双过膝的针织长靴袜。毋庸置疑这些是为了进行伪装，但是，因为那天看起来很暖和，所以他那副样子非常不合时宜。","The day called us about five.A beautiful morning it was, the high westerly wind still blowing strong, but the clouds all blown away to Europe.Alan was already sitting up and smiling to himself.It was my first sight of my friend since we were parted, and I looked upon him with enjoyment.He had still the same big great-coat on his back; but (what was new) he had now a pair of knitted boot-hose drawn above the knee.Doubtless these were intended for disguise; but, as the day promised to be warm, he made a most unseasonable figure."
"“好吧，戴维，”他说，“难道这不是一个美好的早晨吗？这正是我们应该探路的好日子。 和在干草堆里面相比，已经有很大的变化了。你还在那里呼呼大睡的时候，我就已经完成了一件我也许很少做的事情。”","“Well, Davie,” said he, “is this no a bonny morning?Here is a day that looks the way that a day ought to.This is a great change of it from the belly of my haystack; and while you were there sottering and sleeping I have done a thing that maybe I do very seldom.”"
"“那是什么事呢？”我说。","“And what was that?” said I."
"“哦，只不过做了祷告。”他说。","“O, just said my prayers,” said he."
"“按你一贯称呼的，我的那些绅士现在在哪里？”我问。","“And where are my gentry, as ye call them?” I asked."
"“天知道呀，”他说，“早晚我们肯定有机会见到他们。戴维，抬起脚来！出发，命运又一次开始了！而我们要做的就像是愉快地散一次步。”","“Gude kens,” says he; “and the short and the long of it is that we must take our chance of them.Up with your foot-soles, Davie!Forth, Fortune, once again of it!And a bonny walk we are like to have.”"
"于是我们沿着海滩向东走去，朝那个方向在埃斯克口附近，一片片盐场在冒着烟。毫无疑问，阳光一如既往地在亚瑟王王座和碧绿的彭特兰湾上闪烁着，那天艾伦很开心，好像也愿意呆在荨麻丛中。","So we went east by the beach of the sea, towards where the salt-pans were smoking in by the Esk mouth.No doubt there was a by-ordinary bonny blink of morning sun on Arthur’s Seat and the green Pentlands; and the pleasantness of the day appeared to set Alan among nettles."
"“我觉得自己像个傻瓜，”他说，“在这么好的日子却要离开苏格兰。这景致已经深印在我脑海中，我也许最好还是留在这里欣赏欣赏。”","“I feel like a gomeral,” says he, “to be leaving Scotland on a day like this.It sticks in my head; I would maybe like it better to stay here and hing.”"
"“唉，但是你不会那么做的，艾伦。”我说。","“Ay, but ye wouldnae, Alan,” said I."
"“是不会，不过法国也是个好地方，”他解释道，“但还是有点儿不一样。我相信法国更漂亮，可惜它不是苏格兰。在那里的时候，我很喜欢它，伙计。可是我也有点儿厌烦苏格兰的草地和苏格兰的泥炭味了。”","“No, but what France is a good place too,” he explained; “but it’s some way no the same.It’s brawer I believe, but it’s no Scotland.I like it fine when I’m there, man; yet I kind of weary for Scots divots and the Scots peat-reek.”"
"“如果那就是你要抱怨的所有事情，艾伦，那实在不算是什么大事。”我说。","“If that’s all you have to complain of, Alan, it’s no such great affair,” said I."
"“不论抱怨的是什么，那总让我不舒服，”他说，“而我刚刚才从那该死的干草堆里爬出来。”","“And it sets me ill to be complaining, whatever,” said he, “and me but new out of yon deil’s haystack.”"
"“这么说你特别厌烦你的干草堆？”我问。","“And so you were unco weary of your haystack?” I asked."
"“无法形容有多厌烦。”他说，“准确地说，我并不是那么容易沮丧的人，但是我更喜欢头顶清澈的天空。我就像那个老布莱克·道格拉斯（难道不是吗？），喜欢听云雀高歌而不愿听老鼠吱吱叫。而那个地方，你要知道，戴维——那可是个非常适合藏身的地方，因为我随时都可以使用——那是一个从黎明到黄昏都很阴暗的深坑。那些天（或者夜晚，因为我哪里分得清楚是白天还是夜晚？）对我来说就像是漫漫冬日一样漫长。”","“Weary’s nae word for it,” said he.“I’m not just precisely a man that’s easily cast down; but I do better with caller air and the lift above my head.I’m like the auld Black Douglas (wasnae’t?) that likit better to hear the laverock sing than the mouse cheep.And yon place, ye see, Davie—whilk was a very suitable place to hide in, as I’m free to own—was pit mirk from dawn to gloaming.There were days (or nights, for how would I tell one from other?) that seemed to me as long as a long winter.”"
"“那你怎么知道去赴约的时间？”我问。","“How did you know the hour to bide your tryst?” I asked."
"“大约晚上十一点钟的时候，那位主人给我带来肉和一点白兰地酒，还有一根蜡烛，可以吃饭的时候用。”他说，“因此，我狼吞虎咽一番后，就到赶往树林的时间了。我躺在那里，心烦而痛苦地等着你，戴维，”他说，并把手搭在我的肩上，“估摸着大约到什么时候就等了有两个小时——除非查利·斯图尔特来告诉我时间——然后又回到这该死的干草堆里。唉，真是度日如年啊，感谢主，我历经艰辛都熬过来了！”","“The goodman brought me my meat and a drop brandy, and a candle-dowp to eat it by, about eleeven,” said he.“So, when I had swallowed a bit, it would he time to be getting to the wood.There I lay and wearied for ye sore, Davie,” says he, laying his hand on my shoulder “and guessed when the two hours would be about by—unless Charlie Stewart would come and tell me on his watch—and then back to the dooms haystack.Na, it was a driech employ, and praise the Lord that I have warstled through with it!”"
"“你是靠什么熬过来的？”我问。","“What did you do with yourself?” I asked."
"“信念，”他说，“这是我能拥有的最好的事情！有时侯我就玩玩手指关节。我特别会玩手指关节，不过那只是一个没人羡慕的可怜把戏而已。有时候我会编编歌曲。”","“Faith,” said he, “the best I could!Whiles I played at the knucklebones.I’m an extraordinar good hand at the knucklebones, but it’s a poor piece of business playing with naebody to admire ye.And whiles I would make songs.”"
"“那些歌曲都是关于什么的？”我说。","“What were they about?” says I."
"“哦，关于鹿和石楠花的，”他说，“还有关于很久以前那些古代老部落首领的，再有就是一般歌曲所唱的内容了。然后，有时候我会假想我有一套风笛，而且我还在演奏呢。我吹奏一些壮美的曲调，我认为我吹得棒极了，我发誓有时候我都能听到观众的尖叫声！不过最重要的是曲子还演奏完了。”","“O, about the deer and the heather,” says he, “and about the ancient old chiefs that are all by with it lang syne, and just about what songs are about in general.And then whiles I would make believe I had a set of pipes and I was playing.I played some grand springs, and I thought I played them awful bonny; I vow whiles that I could hear the squeal of them!But the great affair is that it’s done with.”"
"之后，他要我再次讲述我的冒险经历，他也再次完整地听了一遍，听得更加细致而且特别赞许，时不时发誓说我是“一个奇特的少年俊杰”。","With that he carried me again to my adventures, which he heard all over again with more particularity, and extraordinary approval, swearing at intervals that I was “a queer character of a callant.”"
"“所以你害怕西蒙·弗雷泽了？”他曾问道。","“So ye were frich’ened of Sim Fraser?” he asked once."
"“我当时确实害怕！”我叫道。","“In troth was I!” cried I."
"“我也一样会害怕的，戴维，”他说，“那的确是个可怕的家伙。不过也该说句公道话才合适。我可以告诉你他在战场上可是一个非常值得尊敬的人物。”","“So would I have been, Davie,” said he.“And that is indeed a driedful man.But it is only proper to give the deil his due: and I can tell you he is a most respectable person on the field of war.”"
"“他有那么勇猛吗？”我问。","“Is he so brave?” I asked."
"“勇猛！”他说，“他就像我的钢刀一样勇猛。”","“Brave!” said he.“He is as brave as my steel sword.”"
"听说我决斗的事，他勃然大怒了。","The story of my duel set him beside himself."
"“想想那一点！”他叫道，“在科里纳基我曾教过你击剑的窍门。居然三次——三次被缴械！ 曾经教过你都是我人格上的一种耻辱！现在，站起来，拔出你的武器。在你能为你自己和我增添更多荣誉之前，你一步也别想跨出路上的这块地方。”","“To think of that!” he cried.“I showed ye the trick in Corrynakiegh too.And three times—three times disarmed!It’s a disgrace upon my character that learned ye!Here, stand up, out with your airn; ye shall walk no step beyond this place upon the road till ye can do yoursel’ and me mair credit.”"
"“艾伦，”我说，“这简直是愚蠢之极。现在没有时间来上击剑课。”","“Alan,” said I, “this is midsummer madness.Here is no time for fencing lessons.”"
"“我不能否认那一点，”他承认道，“但是三次呀，伙计！你就像个稻草人一样站在那里，然后像个兜着尿片的小狗跑去拾自己的剑！戴维，这个叫邓肯斯比的家伙肯定非比寻常！ 他绝对技艺超群。我要是有时间的话，我会立马回去亲自和他战一回合。那家伙一定是个宪兵军官。”","“I cannae well say no to that,” he admitted.“But three times, man!And you standing there like a straw bogle and rinning to fetch your ain sword like a doggie with a pocket-napkin!David, this man Duncansby must be something altogether by-ordinar!He maun be extraordinar skilly.If I had the time, I would gang straight back and try a turn at him mysel’.The man must be a provost.”"
"“你这个糊涂的家伙，”我说，“你忘记了，那只是因为对手是我。”","“You silly fellow,” said I, “you forget it was just me.”"
"“没忘记，”他说，“可是三次呀！” ","“Na,” said he, “but three times!”"
"“你自己知道的，我的确没那能耐。”我叫道。","“When ye ken yourself that I am fair incompetent,” I cried."
"“好吧，可是我还从来没有听人说过这等事情呢。”他说。","“Well, I never heard tell the equal of it,” said he."
"“我向你保证一件事，艾伦。”我说，“下一次我们再相聚的时候，我会学得更好。你不会继续承受一个不会击剑的朋友带给你的耻辱。”","“I promise you the one thing, Alan,” said I.“The next time that we forgather, I’ll be better learned.You shall not continue to bear the disgrace of a friend that cannot strike.”"
"“唉，下一次！”他说，“那要到什么时候呢，嗯？”","“Ay, the next time!” says he.“And when will that be, I would like to ken?”"
"“好吧，艾伦，关于那一点我也已经有些想法了，”我说，“我的计划是这样的。我的想法就是去当一名律师。”","“Well, Alan, I have had some thoughts of that, too,” said I; “and my plan is this.It’s my opinion to be called an advocate.”"
"“那可是一种让人厌烦的行业，戴维，”艾伦说，“宁可去当个流氓都好一些。你去穿皇家军人的外套都胜过干那一行。”","“That’s but a weary trade, Davie,” says Alan, “and rather a blagyard one forby.Ye would be better in a king’s coat than that.”"
"“但是毫无疑问那种方式会让我们再次相遇。”我叫道，“不过当你穿上法王路易的军外套，而我却穿上英王乔治的军外套时，我们将会有一场别致的会面。”","“And no doubt that would be the way to have us meet,” cried I.“But as you’ll be in King Lewie’s coat, and I’ll be in King Geordie’s, we’ll have a dainty meeting of it.”"
"“那倒是有一些道理。”他承认道。","“There’s some sense in that,” he admitted"
"“那么，就当一名律师，也只能这样。”我继续说道，“我认为对一个三次被缴械的绅士而言，这个行当更加适合。不过这件事的妙处在这一点：学习那种专业最好的学院之一就是荷兰的莱登学院——我的同族亲戚皮尔里格曾在那所学院学习过。现在，你怎么说，艾伦？难道一个皇家艾科塞兹军官学校的学生就不能请假，溜过边界，去申请当一名莱登的大学生？”","“An advocate, then, it’ll have to be,” I continued, “and I think it a more suitable trade for a gentleman that was three times disarmed.But the beauty of the thing is this: that one of the best colleges for that kind of learning—and the one where my kinsman, Pilrig, made his studies—is the college of Leyden in Holland.Now, what say you, Alan?Could not a cadet of Royal Ecossais get a furlough, slip over the marches, and call in upon a Leyden student?”"
"“好吧，我认为他能！”他叫道，“你看，我深受我的上校德拉蒙德·梅尔福特伯爵的宠信。而且更重要的是我有一位堂兄弟是苏格兰—荷兰军团的陆军中校。我要告个假去看望霍尔基特的斯图尔特中校，这可是再合适不过了。而梅尔福特大人是那种做事非常细致严谨的人，像恺撒那样会写书，能从我的叙述中有所收获，他无疑会很高兴的。”","“Well, and I would think he could!” cried he.“Ye see, I stand well in with my colonel, Count Drummond-Melfort; and, what’s mair to the purpose I have a cousin of mine lieutenant-colonel in a regiment of the Scots-Dutch.Naething could be mair proper than what I would get a leave to see Lieutenant-Colonel Stewart of Halkett’s.And Lord Melfort, who is a very scienteefic kind of a man, and writes books like Caesar, would be doubtless very pleased to have the advantage of my observes.”"
"“那么，梅尔福特大人是作家吗？”我问道，因为正像艾伦对军人很崇拜一样，我更多地仰慕著书立说的绅士。","“Is Lord Meloort an author, then?”I asked, for much as Alan thought of soldiers, I thought more of the gentry that write books."
"“正是一位作家，戴维。”他说，“人们会认为一位上校会有更适合他关注的事情。但是把那编成歌曲，我又能说什么呢？”","“The very same, Davie,” said he.“One would think a colonel would have something better to attend to.But what can I say that make songs?”"
"“好吧，那么，”我说，“剩下的事就是把你在法国的通信地址留给我，我一到莱登就会把我的地址寄给你。”","“Well, then,” said I, “it only remains you should give me an address to write you at in France; and as soon as I am got to Leyden I will send you mine.”"
"“最好是由我的族长把信转给我，”他说，“阿德希尔的查尔斯·斯图尔特先生，住在法国岛屿上的梅隆镇。也许要很长时间，也许只要很短的时间，不过信最终都会送到我的手上。” ","“The best will be to write me in the care of my chieftain,” said he, “Charles Stewart, of Ardsheil, Esquire, at the town of Melons, in the Isle of France.It might take long, or it might take short, but it would aye get to my hands at the last of it.”"
"早餐我们在马瑟尔堡吃了黑线鳕鱼，在那里听艾伦大谈特谈让我感到很开心。在这温暖的早晨，他的长大衣和长靴袜特别打眼，也许是种暗示，说明他见多识广。但是艾伦讲话就像在谈生意，或者我应该说，就好像乐在其中。他忙着向房子的女主人夸赞黑线鳕鱼的美味。之后剩余的所有时间，他都在和女主人谈论他的胃受寒不适，表情严肃地叙述着种种症状和遭罪的样子，并且饶有兴趣地听她回答时所提供的那些老婆婆的治疗方法。","We had a haddock to our breakfast in Musselburgh, where it amused me vastly to hear Alan.His great-coat and boot-hose were extremely remarkable this warm morning, and perhaps some hint of an explanation had been wise; but Alan went into that matter like a business, or I should rather say, like a diversion.He engaged the goodwife of the house with some compliments upon the rizzoring of our haddocks; and the whole of the rest of our stay held her in talk about a cold he had taken on his stomach, gravely relating all manner of symptoms and sufferings, and hearing with a vast show of interest all the old wives’ remedies she could supply him with in return."
"在来自爱丁堡的第一辆九便士马车到来之前，我们就离开了马瑟尔堡，因为（如艾伦所说）那样我们可能避免一场遭遇战。虽然风依然很强劲，但是天气温和，阳光灿烂，而艾伦遭的罪相应地也就更大了。他拉我离开普雷斯顿潘斯来到格拉德斯莫的战场，在那里他对那场战役的各个阶段长篇大论了一番。随后，迈着他一贯的那种轻快步子，我们向科肯齐前进了。虽然人们还在卡德尔夫人的作坊里制造运青鱼的车，但是科肯齐似乎是一个如荒漠般正在衰败的小镇，大约一半的房子都是废墟。不过酒店还算干净，而艾伦现在兴致正高，肯定要好好享受一瓶麦芽酒，然后会继续向一位新的幸运者讲述他胃寒不适的老故事，只不过现在其症状却完全不一样了。","We left Musselburgh before the first ninepenny coach was due from Edinburgh for (as Alan said) that was a rencounter we might very well avoid.The wind although still high, was very mild, the sun shone strong, and Alan began to suffer in proportion.From Prestonpans he had me aside to the field of Gladsmuir, where he exerted himself a great deal more than needful to describe the stages of the battle.Thence, at his old round pace, we travelled to Cockenzie.Though they were building herring-busses there at Mrs. Cadell’s, it seemed a desert-like, back-going town, about half full of ruined houses; but the ale-house was clean, and Alan, who was now in a glowing heat, must indulge himself with a bottle of ale, and carry on to the new luckie with the old story of the cold upon his stomach, only now the symptoms were all different."
"我坐在那里听着，然后突然想起我几乎没有听到他向任何一位女人说过三句正经话，他总是在开她们玩笑，在揶揄并私下里嘲笑她们，而且他对这一类事情特别热衷和有兴趣。当那女主人（碰巧）被叫走后，我向他说起我对他有些这样的印象。","I sat listening; and it came in my mind that I had scarce ever heard him address three serious words to any woman, but he was always drolling and fleering and making a private mock of them, and yet brought to that business a remarkable degree of energy and interest.Something to this effect I remarked to him, when the good-wife (as chanced) was called away."
"“你想要什么？”他说，“一个男人和女性在一起的时候就应该表现出他最佳的一面，应该讲一点儿故事来哄她们开心，这些可怜的乖乖！这是你应该学会关注的，戴维。你应该掌握这些原则，这就像是一门手艺。 要知道，如果是一个年轻女子或者是一个美女，她是绝不会听我来谈论我的胃的，戴维。可是因为她们年纪太大无法再去寻找情人了，所以她们才会声称自己懂药理。为什么？我怎么知道的？我想，上帝就是这么造她们的。但是我认为一个男人如果连这一点都没有注意到，那他真是一个傻瓜。”","“What do ye want?” says he.“A man should aye put his best foot forrit with the womankind; he should aye give them a bit of a story to divert them, the poor lambs!It’s what ye should learn to attend to, David; ye should get the principles, it’s like a trade.Now, if this had been a young lassie, or onyways bonnie, she would never have heard tell of my stomach, Davie.But aince they’re too old to be seeking joes, they a’ set up to be apotecaries.Why?What do I ken?They’ll be just the way God made them, I suppose.But I think a man would be a gomeral that didnae give his attention to the same.”"
"这时，那位幸运的妇人回来了，他好像迫不及待地就转身离开我去重续他们之前的谈话了。 那位夫人先从艾伦的胃谈起，随后说到她自己在阿伯莱迪的一位好兄弟的病例，她絮絮叨叨地描述了那个人最后生病和死亡的情形。有时说得只是很乏味，有时则说得既乏味又可怕，因为她说起来还津津有味的。结果，我就深深陷入沉思之中，朝前面看着窗外的路，但对所看到的东西却几乎没有印象。不久，如果有人一直在看着我的话，他们可能就看到我起身了。","And here, the luckie coming back, he turned from me as if with impatience to renew their former conversation.The lady had branched some while before from Alan’s stomach to the case of a goodbrother of her own in Aberlady, whose last sickness and demise she was describing at extraordinary length.Sometimes it was merely dull, sometimes both dull and awful, for she talked with unction.The upshot was that I fell in a deep muse, looking forth of the window on the road, and scarce marking what I saw.Presently had any been looking they might have seen me to start."
"“我们把他的脚热敷了一下，”那女主人在说，“在他的腹部放了一块热石头，然后我们给他弄了些牛膝草和薄荷水，还在房里准备了上好的、干净的硫磺香液……”","“We pit a fomentation to his feet,” the good-wife was saying, “and a het stane to his wame, and we gied him hyssop and water of pennyroyal, and fine, clean balsam of sulphur for the hoast...”"
"“先生，”我轻声插话说道，“我有一位朋友从房子旁边走过去了。”","“Sir,” says I, cutting very quietly in, “there’s a friend of mine gone by the house.”"
"“你看见了？”艾伦回答道，好像这只是一桩小事。然后他说：“你刚才在说什么，夫人？”于是那令人厌烦的妇人又接着说了下去。","“Is that e’en sae?” replies Alan, as though it were a thing of small account.And then, “Ye were saying, mem?” says he; and the wearyful wife went on."
"然而，不久他就给了她一枚两先令六便士的硬币，她必须到前面去找零钱。","Presently, however, he paid her with a half-crown piece, and she must go forth after the change."
"“是那个红头发的人吗？”艾伦问。","“Was it him with the red head?” asked Alan."
"“你说对了。”我说。","“Ye have it,” said I."
"“我在树林里是怎么跟你说的？”他叫道，“不过很奇怪他居然也会现身此处！他是藏在那条小巷里吗？”","“What did I tell you in the wood?” he cried.“And yet it’s strange he should be here too!Was he his lane?”"
"“他藏身的小巷我可以看得到。”我说。","“His lee-lane for what I could see,” said I."
"“他身边有同伙吗？”他问道。","“Did he gang by?” he asked."
"“直看过去，”我说，“既不要朝右看也不要朝左看。”","“Straight by,” said I, “and looked neither to the right nor left.”"
"“那就更奇怪了，”艾伦说，“我牢牢记住了，戴维，我们该动身了。可是去哪里呢？鬼才知道！这就像过去的日子清晰地再现了。”他叫道。","“And that’s queerer yet,” said Alan.“It sticks in my mind, Davie, that we should be stirring.But where to?—deil hae’t!This is like old days fairly,” cries he."
"“不过有一点大不相同了，”我说，“那就是现在我们的口袋里有钱了。”","“There is one big differ, though,” said I, “that now we have money in our pockets.”"
"“另外还有一点大不相同，鲍尔弗先生，”他说，“就是现在我们身后有一群狗在跟着我们。他们嗅着气味，他们紧追不舍，戴维。这件事很麻烦，真见鬼了。”然后他坐在那里苦苦思索，他脸上的那副神情我非常熟悉。","“And another big differ, Mr. Balfour,” says he, “that now we have dogs at our tail.They’re on the scent; they’re in full cry, David.It’s a bad business and be damned to it.”And he sat thinking hard with a look of his that I knew well."
"“我正想说呢，幸运的夫人，”当那个女主人返回时，他说道，“你这家小酒馆后面有路出去吗？”","“I’m saying, Luckie,” says he, when the goodwife returned, “have ye a back road out of this change house?”"
"她告诉他有路出去，并告诉他小路会通向何方。","She told him there was and where it led to."
"“那么，先生，”他对我说，“我想这对我们来说会是一条最短的路。我在这里向你告别了，美丽的夫人，我永远也不会忘记你这里的肉桂水酒。”","“Then, sir,” says he to me, “I think that will be the shortest road for us.And here’s good-bye to ye, my braw woman; and I’ll no forget thon of the cinnamon water.”"
"我们从那妇人放蔬菜的院子走出，然后沿一条田间小道向上而去。艾伦警觉地环顾四周，确认我们是在乡间的一小片空洼地，已超出了追兵的视线，就坐了下来。","We went out by way of the woman’s kale yard, and up a lane among fields.Alan looked sharply to all sides, and seeing we were in a little hollow place of the country, out of view of men, sat down."
"“现在要开一个战时会议，戴维。”他说，“但是首先，给你上一点儿课。假设之前我像你一样，那老太太会怎么看待我们两个！只知道我们从后门出去而已。而她现在会想到什么？一位优秀、快活、待人友好、身体羸弱的男子，遭受着胃病的折磨，可怜的人啊！而且还真心同情她那位好兄弟。哦，伙计呀，戴维，学着掌握一些智慧吧！”","“Now for a council of war, Davie,” said he.“But first of all, a bit lesson to ye.Suppose that I had been like you, what would yon old wife have minded of the pair of us!Just that we had gone out by the back gate.And what does she mind now?A fine, canty, friendly, cracky man, that suffered with the stomach, poor body! and was real ta’en up about the goodbrother.O man, David, try and learn to have some kind of intelligence!”"
"“我会努力学的，艾伦。”我说。","“I’ll try, Alan,” said I."
"“那么现在就来谈谈那个红头发的家伙，”他说，“他跑得快还是慢？”“介于两者之间，不快也不慢吧。”我说。","“And now for him of the red head,” says he; “was he gaun fast or slow?”“Betwixt and between,” said I."
"“这个家伙不是那种走路急匆匆的吧？”他问。","“No kind of a hurry about the man?” he asked."
"“从来没有一丝那样的迹象。”我说。","“Never a sign of it,” said I."
"“嗯！”艾伦说，“看起来很奇怪。今天早晨在温斯的时候，我们连他们的影子都没有看到。他从我们身边走过，似乎并没有注意到我们，但是现在他却出现在我们的路上了！天哪，戴维，我开始有点儿头绪了。我觉得他们在找的不是你，我认为他们找的是我。而且我想他们非常清楚他们要去哪里。”","“Nhm!” said Alan, “it looks queer.We saw nothing of them this morning on the Whins; he’s passed us by, he doesnae seem to be looking, and yet here he is on our road!Dod, Davie, I begin to take a notion.I think it’s no you they’re seeking, I think it’s me; and I think they ken fine where they’re gaun.”"
"“他们清楚？”我问。","“They ken?” I asked."
"“我认为是安迪·斯库格尔出卖了我——他或者他的船员对这件事情有所了解——要不然就是查利的办事员，那也很遗憾。”艾伦说，“如果你只是想问我内心个人的想法，我觉得有人将会在吉兰沙滩掉脑袋。”","“I think Andie Scougal’s sold me—him or his mate wha kent some part of the affair—or else Charlie’s clerk callant, which would be a pity too,” says Alan; “and if you askit me for just my inward private conviction, I think there’ll be heads cracked on Gillane sands.”"
"“艾伦，”我叫道，“如果你完全肯定有人在那里等着了，那就逃生吧。那就不会有什么掉脑袋的事情了。” ","“Alan,” I cried, “if you’re at all right there’ll be folk there and to spare.It’ll be small service to crack heads.”"
"“这倒不失为令人满意的办法。”艾伦说，“但是等一下，等一下，我在想——多亏这美妙的西风，我相信我还是有机会试一试的。是这样的，戴维。我要等黄昏到来之后才会如约去见斯库格尔。不过，”他说，“如果我能从西边借一点点风，我或许在那里会呆得久一点儿。”他说，“就呆在菲德拉岛后面等你。现在，要是你的那些绅士已经知道了那个地方，他们也就会知道约定的时间了。你明白我要干什么了吗，戴维？多亏了约翰尼·科普和其他红衣傻瓜，我才能对这片土地了如指掌。如果你已经做好准备要再次和艾伦·布雷克一起逃跑的话，我们就得折回海岸边，重新回到德尔顿附近的海滩。如果船在那里，我们就要想办法登上那艘船。如果船不在那里，我就只好返回我那讨厌的干草堆去了。但是不论走哪一条路，我们都得甩开你的那些绅士，就让他们用拇指去吹口哨好了。”","“It would aye be a satisfaction though,” says Alan.“But bide a bit; bide a bit; I’m thinking—and thanks to this bonny westland wind, I believe I’ve still a chance of it.It’s this way, Davie.I’m no trysted with this man Scougal till the gloaming comes.But,” says he, “if I can get a bit of a wind out of the west I’ll be there long or that,” he says, “and lie-to for ye behind the Isle of Fidra.Now if your gentry kens the place, they ken the time forbye.Do ye see me coming, Davie?Thanks to Johnnie Cope and other red-coat gomerals, I should ken this country like the back of my hand; and if ye’re ready for another bit run with Alan Breck, we’ll can cast back inshore, and come to the seaside again by Dirleton.If the ship’s there, we’ll try and get on board of her.If she’s no there, I’ll just have to get back to my weary haystack.But either way of it, I think we will leave your gentry whistling on their thumbs.”"
"“我相信这里面有机会。”我说，“你带上我吧，艾伦！”","“I believe there’s some chance in it,” said I.“Have on with ye, Alan!”"
"第十三章 吉兰沙滩","CHAPTER XIII—GILLANE SANDS"
"就像艾伦当初在科普将军带领下行军一样，我靠艾伦带路也没得到什么好处，因为我几乎说不出我们走的是什么路。我觉得那是因为我们走得太快了。我们有时在飞跑，有时小跑，而其余时间也是迈着复仇一样的步伐在走。有两次，我们跑得最快的时候，都是和那些乡下人逆向奔跑的。虽然我们在转弯时撞到了第一个乡下人，但艾伦已经准备好，就像一支上了膛的步枪。","I did not profit by Alan’s pilotage as he had done by his marchings under General Cope; for I can scarce tell what way we went.It is my excuse that we travelled exceeding fast.Some part we ran, some trotted, and the rest walked at a vengeance of a pace.Twice, while we were at top speed, we ran against country-folk; but though we plumped into the first from round a corner, Alan was as ready as a loaded musket."
"“你看见我的马了吗？”他气喘吁吁地问道。","“Has ye seen my horse?” he gasped."
"“没有，老兄，我今天根本就没有看见过马。”那乡下人回答。","“Na, man, I haenae seen nae horse the day,” replied the countryman."
"艾伦费了些时间跟他解释说我们“两人合骑一匹马”在旅行，我们的马居然跑掉了，恐怕已经跑回林顿的老家了。不仅如此，他还费力（虽然他已经没有剩下多少力气了）咒骂，说都是因为他自己倒霉再加上我愚蠢，才惹出这样的麻烦。","And Alan spared the time to explain to him that we were travelling “ride and tie”; that our charger had escaped, and it was feared he had gone home to Linton.Not only that, but he expended some breath (of which he had not very much left) to curse his own misfortune and my stupidity which was said to be its cause."
"“对他们不能说实话，”我们继续前行时，他对我说道，“应该要刻意给他们留下一种诚实、利于掩护自己的说法。如果人们不知道你在做什么，戴维，他们就会疑虑丛生；可是如果他们以为自己知道了，他们就会不再那么关注此事，就像不再关注我是怎么熬豌豆粥一样。”","“Them that cannae tell the truth,” he observed to myself as we went on again, “should be aye mindful to leave an honest, handy lee behind them.If folk dinnae ken what ye’re doing, Davie, they’re terrible taken up with it; but if they think they ken, they care nae mair for it than what I do for pease porridge.”"
"因为我们起先是向内陆走的，所以到最后我们的路就非常靠近北方了。阿伯莱迪的老教堂在左边，是一处标志性建筑；在右边则是贝里克郡法院高耸的尖顶。就这样我们又走到海边了，这里距离德尔顿不远。 从北贝里克郡向西到吉兰海角一线排列着四个小岛：克雷格利斯、拉姆、菲德拉，还有艾布劳，因其大小、形状各异而著称。菲德拉最特别，是座奇异的灰色小岛，有两个驼峰，一片废墟使之越发显眼。我留意到（随着我们越来越靠近它）这些废墟上的门或窗就像是大海窥视人间的眼睛。在菲德拉的庇护下，西风中有一处很好的锚泊地，在那里，从很远的地方，我们就可以看到“呼啸”号正在游弋。","As we had first made inland, so our road came in the end to lie very near due north; the old Kirk of Aberlady for a landmark on the left; on the right, the top of the Berwick Law; and it was thus we struck the shore again, not far from Dirleton.From north Berwick west to Gillane Ness there runs a string of four small islets, Craiglieth, the Lamb, Fidra, and Eyebrough, notable by their diversity of size and shape.Fidra is the most particular, being a strange grey islet of two humps, made the more conspicuous by a piece of ruin; and I mind that (as we drew closer to it) by some door or window of these ruins the sea peeped through like a man’s eye.Under the lee of Fidra there is a good anchorage in westerly winds, and there, from a far way off, we could see the Thistle riding."
"面对这些小岛的海滨到处都是一片荒芜。这里渺无人烟，鲜有过客，或者说最多只是有些流浪的孩子在跑着嬉戏。吉兰是个小地方，在海角远远的一侧，德尔顿人都在内陆各地做生意，而那些北贝里克郡人则从他们的港口直接出海捕鱼，所以，没有几处海岸像这里一样人迹罕至了。我们匍匐着爬过地形各异的高地和洼谷时，擦亮眼睛观察着四周，我们的心在胸腔怦怦狂跳，但是我注意到阳光与海水如此明媚耀眼，一阵微风从弯腰的小草中拂过，还有那上蹦下跳的野兔和高高飞翔的海鸥带来一阵喧闹，所以那片荒芜之地在我看来竟然充满了勃勃生机。无疑从各个方面来看，这都不失为秘密登船的极好选择，只要这秘密一直保守得好。即使秘密给泄露了，而且该地也被监视了，我们也能不被察觉地爬到沙丘的前面，虽然他们可以直接俯视那片海滩和海面。","The shore in face of these islets is altogether waste.Here is no dwelling of man, and scarce any passage, or at most of vagabond children running at their play.Gillane is a small place on the far side of the Ness, the folk of Dirleton go to their business in the inland fields, and those of North Berwick straight to the sea-fishing from their haven; so that few parts of the coast are lonelier.But I mind, as we crawled upon our bellies into that multiplicity of heights and hollows, keeping a bright eye upon all sides, and our hearts hammering at our ribs, there was such a shining of the sun and the sea, such a stir of the wind in the bent grass, and such a bustle of down-popping rabbits and up-flying gulls, that the desert seemed to me, like a place alive.No doubt it was in all ways well chosen for a secret embarcation, if the secret had been kept; and even now that it was out, and the place watched, we were able to creep unperceived to the front of the sandhills, where they look down immediately on the beach and sea."
"但是艾伦却停下了脚步。","But here Alan came to a full stop."
"“戴维，”他说，“这是一条难以穿越的通道！我们只有躺在这里才安全，但是我就无法靠近我的船或者靠近法国的海岸了。一旦我们起身向双桅帆船发出信号，那就是另一码事了。因为跟踪你的那些绅士会在哪里，你想一想？”","“Davie,” said he, “this is a kittle passage!As long as we lie here we’re safe; but I’m nane sae muckle nearer to my ship or the coast of France.And as soon as we stand up and signal the brig, it’s another matter.For where will your gentry be, think ye?”"
"“也许他们还没有来，”我说，“而且即使他们来了，有一点显然于我们有利。他们全部会被安排来抓捕我们，千真万确。但是他们本来做好准备我们会从东边来的，而现在我们却在他们的西边。”","“Maybe they’re no come yet,” said I.“And even if they are, there’s one clear matter in our favour.They’ll be all arranged to take us, that’s true.But they’ll have arranged for our coming from the east and here we are upon their west.”"
"“是啊，”艾伦说，“我真希望我们有些兵力，而这就是一场战斗，那我们就可以自如地操纵他们！可惜并非如此，戴维。照目前的情况，艾伦·布雷克一点儿也乐观不起来。我犹豫了，戴维。”","“Ay,” says Alan, “I wish we were in some force, and this was a battle, we would have bonnily out-manoeuvred them!But it isnae, Davit; and the way it is, is a wee thing less inspiring to Alan Breck.I swither, Davie.”"
"“时机稍纵即逝，艾伦。”我说。","“Time flies, Alan,” said I."
"“我知道那一点。”艾伦说，“就像法国人说的，此外我一无所知。但这件事从头到尾都很可怕。哦！要是我知道跟踪你的那些绅士在哪里就好了！”","“I ken that,” said Alan.“I ken naething else, as the French folk say.But this is a dreidful case of heids or tails.O! if I could but ken where your gentry were!”"
"“艾伦，”我说，“这根本不像你了。要当机立断，否则就没机会了。”","“Alan,” said I, “this is no like you.It’s got to be now or never.”"
"“这根本不是我，他引用说，”艾伦唱着，带着一副介于羞愧和滑稽之间的奇怪表情，","“This is no me, quo’ he,” sang Alan, with a queer face betwixt shame and drollery."
"“既不是你也不是我，他引用说，既不是你也不是我。哇，不是，约翰尼伙计！既不是你也不是我。”","“Neither you nor me, quo’ he, neither you nor me.Wow, na, Johnnie man! neither you nor me.”"
"然后他突然在原地笔直站了起来，右手挥舞着一方手帕，向下行进走上了海滩。我自己也站了起来，但是却踯躅在后，审视着东边的沙丘。他的出现起初没有引起注意：斯库格尔没料到他会来得那么早，而跟踪我的那些绅士都在监视着另一个方向。跟着“呼啸”号上的人就醒悟过来了，他们似乎早已做好一切准备，因为甲板上只忙碌了顷刻，我们就看到一艘小艇从大船的尾部放了下来，而且那小艇开始轻快地驶向海岸。几乎就在同时，大约离吉兰海角半英里远的地方，一个男人的身影瞬间出现在沙丘上，挥舞着双臂。然而刹那间他又不见了，那里的海鸥仍旧自由地飞翔了一阵。","And then of a sudden he stood straight up where he was, and with a handkerchief flying in his right hand, marched down upon the beach.I stood up myself, but lingered behind him, scanning the sand-hills to the east.His appearance was at first unremarked: Scougal not expecting him so early, and my gentry watching on the other side.Then they awoke on board the Thistle, and it seemed they had all in readiness, for there was scarce a second’s bustle on the deck before we saw a skiff put round her stern and begin to pull lively for the coast.Almost at the same moment of time, and perhaps half a mile away towards Gillane Ness, the figure of a man appeared for a blink upon a sandhill, waving with his arms; and though he was gone again in the same flash, the gulls in that part continued a little longer to fly wild."
"艾伦没有看见这些，他直盯着海面上那艘大船和小艇。","Alan had not seen this, looking straight to seaward at the ship and skiff."
"“一定会如料想的那样！”我告诉他的时候，他说道，“小艇会正好划到的，否则追兵就会搜索我栖身的陡峭岩石了。” ","“It maun be as it will!” said he, when I had told him, “Weel may yon boatie row, or my craig’ll have to thole a raxing.”"
"那段海滩又长又平坦，在退潮时尤其适于散步。一条长满水芹的小河从海滩上的一处地方流过，奔向大海。沿着海滩尽头的那一堆堆沙丘就像镇上的城墙一样。我们的眼力无法查看到沙丘后面旷野中的动静，我们也不能加快小艇到来的速度。在那段令人煎熬的等待中，时间仿佛都停滞了。","That part of the beach was long and flat, and excellent walking when the tide was down; a little cressy burn flowed over it in one place to the sea; and the sandhills ran along the head of it like the rampart of a town.No eye of ours could spy what was passing behind there in the bents, no hurry of ours could mend the speed of the boat’s coming: time stood still with us through that uncanny period of waiting."
"“有一件事我想知道，”艾伦说，“我想知道那些绅士得到的命令。我们俩值四百英镑呢，如果他们拿枪对着我们，我们怎么办，戴维！他们从那条长长的沙堤顶部很好向我们射击的。","“There is one thing I would like to ken,” say Alan.“I would like to ken these gentry’s orders.We’re worth four hunner pound the pair of us: how if they took the guns to us, Davie!They would get a bonny shot from the top of that lang sandy bank.”"
"“理论上是不可能的，”我说，“关键是他们不可能有长枪。这件事处理得极为隐秘。手枪他们还可能有，但绝不会有长枪。”","“Morally impossible,” said I.“The point is that they can have no guns.This thing has been gone about too secret; pistols they may have, but never guns.”"
"“我相信你说得对，”艾伦说，“尽管我等那小艇已经等得不耐烦了。”","“I believe ye’ll be in the right,” says Alan.“For all which I am wearing a good deal for yon boat.”"
"于是他含住手指，就像对着狗一样对着那小艇吹起了口哨。","And he snapped his fingers and whistled to it like a dog."
"现在小艇大概行驶了三分之一的路程，而我们自己则艰难地在海边上走着，结果柔软的沙子漫进了我的鞋子里。除了等待，我们别无他事可做，唯有放眼去看那小艇越爬越近。那绵长的沙丘横亘在面前，难以逾越，但见海鸥在上空忽闪而过，毫无疑问我们的敌人正在沙丘的后面集结待发。","It was now perhaps a third of the way in, and we ourselves already hard on the margin of the sea, so that the soft sand rose over my shoes.There was no more to do whatever but to wait, to look as much as we were able at the creeping nearer of the boat, and as little as we could manage at the long impenetrable front of the sandhills, over which the gulls twinkled and behind which our enemies were doubtless marshalling."
"“这是一个美丽、明亮、空气清新的地方，我们却要被射杀在这里，”艾伦突然说道，“伙计，我希望我有你那样的勇气！”","“This is a fine, bright, caller place to get shot in,” says Alan suddenly; “and, man, I wish that I had your courage!”"
"“艾伦，”我叫道，“这是什么话呀！你就是勇气所铸就的，那就是男子汉的品质。要是没有别人可以证明的话，我本人就可以来证明。”","“Alan!” I cried, “what kind of talk is this of it!You’re just made of courage; it’s the character of the man, as I could prove myself if there was nobody else.”"
"“那你就更加弄错了，”他说，“我和你的不同之处仅仅在于我对事物有较强的洞察力和理解力。但是说到成熟、冷静、顽强和极度的勇气，我连给你秉烛都不配。看看此刻在沙滩上的我们两个。我在这里是坐立不安，急于离开；而你在这里（就我所知）对于是否留下还三心二意的。 你觉得我能做到那一点或者愿意那么做吗？ 我根本不行! 首先，因为我既没有勇气也没有胆量；第二，因为我是个很有洞察力的人，就会先看透你这个家伙怎么想的。”","“And you would be the more mistaken,” said he.“What makes the differ with me is just my great penetration and knowledge of affairs.But for auld, cauld, dour, deadly courage, I am not fit to hold a candle to yourself.Look at us two here upon the sands.Here am I, fair hotching to be off; here’s you (for all that I ken) in two minds of it whether you’ll no stop.Do you think that I could do that, or would?No me!Firstly, because I havenae got the courage and wouldnae daur; and secondly, because I am a man of so much penetration and would see ye damned first.”"
"“你又来了，是吗？”我叫道，“啊，艾伦好家伙，你可以骗那些老太太，但你绝对骗不了我。”","“It’s there ye’re coming, is it?” I cried.“Ah, man Alan, you can wile your old wives, but you never can wile me.”"
"想起我在树林里受到的诱惑，这使我坚强如钢。","Remembrance of my temptation in the wood made me strong as iron."
"“我还有个约会要赴。”我继续说道，“我与你的堂兄查利有约，我已经作出了承诺。”","“I have a tryst to keep,” I continued.“I am trysted with your cousin Charlie; I have passed my word.”"
"“你要赶赴那美好的约会，”艾伦说，“只要有那些躲在荒野里的绅士，你就去不成。那怎么办？”他以非常唬人的严肃态度继续说，“只要告诉我，我的小子！ 你是否会像格兰奇夫人一样被绑架走？他们是否会用匕首捅进你的身体，然后把你埋在荒郊野外？或者是用别的办法，他们是否会把你带进监狱和詹姆斯关在一起？他们是不是值得信任的人？你是不是会把自己的脑袋伸进西蒙·弗雷泽和其他辉格党人的虎口里去？”他语气特别讥讽地补充说道。","“Braw trysts that you’ll can keep,” said Alan.“Ye’ll just mistryst aince and for a’ with the gentry in the bents.And what for?” he went on with an extreme threatening gravity.“Just tell me that, my mannie!Are ye to be speerited away like Lady Grange?Are they to drive a dirk in your inside and bury ye in the bents?Or is it to be the other way, and are they to bring ye in with James?Are they folk to be trustit?Would ye stick your head in the mouth of Sim Fraser and the ither Whigs?” he added with extraordinary bitterness."
"“艾伦，”我叫道，“他们都是些流氓和骗子，对此我完全同意你的看法。在这样一个盗贼横行的土地上就更有理由要有一位正派人士！我的承诺既已出口，我就一定会坚守的。我很久以前就对你的同族女亲戚说过，在任何危险面前我都绝不会犹豫。你还记得那句话吗？就是雷德·科林毙命的那天夜里。那么，我就无需赘言了。现在我不走了。普雷斯顿格兰奇曾答应过要保我一命。如果他是个随便作承诺的人，那我今天就只有去死了。”","“Alan,” cried I, “they’re all rogues and liars, and I’m with ye there.The more reason there should be one decent man in such a land of thieves!My word in passed, and I’ll stick to it.I said long syne to your kinswoman that I would stumble at no risk.Do ye mind of that?—the night Red Colin fell, it was.No more I will, then.Here I stop.Prestongrange promised me my life: if he’s to be mansworn, here I’ll have to die.”"
"“好了，好了。”艾伦说。","“Aweel aweel,” said Alan."
"这段时间我们都没有再看见跟踪我们的人或者听到他们的动静。事实上我们一直下意识地在捕捉他们的身影，他们的整个队伍（我后来才知道的）还没有赶到现场，他们正分布在前往吉兰的荒野中。 要把他们召集起来并带过来还真不容易，而小艇正在加速。此外，他们只不过是些胆小的家伙：只是一群高地牧贼，来自几个部落，没有绅士来当领头人，所以他们在海滩上对我和艾伦监视得越多，（我不能不认为）他们就越不愿意被我们发现。","All this time we had seen or heard no more of our pursuers.In truth we had caught them unawares; their whole party (as I was to learn afterwards) had not yet reached the scene; what there was of them was spread among the bents towards Gillane.It was quite an affair to call them in and bring them over, and the boat was making speed.They were besides but cowardly fellows: a mere leash of Highland cattle-thieves, of several clans, no gentleman there to be the captain and the more they looked at Alan and me upon the beach, the less (I must suppose) they liked the look of us."
"不论是谁出卖的艾伦，都绝不会是船长。他亲自在小艇上掌舵并且在鼓励他的手下，像一个尽心办事的男子汉。他已经靠近了，小艇安全驶来——因为即将得救而感到兴奋，艾伦的脸已经绯红，而此时我们那些在荒野中的朋友，要么是因为绝望地发现猎物已经成功出逃，要么是因为希望能够吓唬吓唬安迪，突然发出了一阵混杂着几种声音的尖叫声。","Whoever had betrayed Alan it was not the captain: he was in the skiff himself, steering and stirring up his oarsmen, like a man with his heart in his employ.Already he was near in, and the boat securing—already Alan’s face had flamed crimson with the excitement of his deliverance, when our friends in the bents, either in their despair to see their prey escape them or with some hope of scaring Andie, raised suddenly a shrill cry of several voices."
"这声音，从那片显得相当荒凉的海岸响起，真是太骇人了，于是艇上的人立刻停稳了。","This sound, arising from what appeared to be a quite deserted coast, was really very daunting, and the men in the boat held water instantly."
"“这是什么声音？”船长大声吆喝道，因为他已经到了近旁，能够轻易打招呼了。","“What’s this of it?” sings out the captain, for he was come within an easy hail."
"“我自由了。”艾伦说道，立即开始涉过浅水区奔向小艇，“戴维，”他说，停顿了一下，“戴维，难道你不来吗？我真舍不得离开你。”","“Freens o’mine,” says Alan, and began immediately to wade forth in the shallow water towards the boat.“Davie,” he said, pausing, “Davie, are ye no coming?I am swier to leave ye.”"
"“毫发都不会动。”我说。","“Not a hair of me,” said I."
"他站立了片刻，犹豫着，海水淹没到了他的膝盖。","“He stood part of a second where he was to his knees in the salt water, hesitating."
"“他一定要去库珀，必须去库珀。”他说，然后冲进深过腰部的水中，他被拉进小艇，小艇立刻驶向大船。","“He that will to Cupar, maun to Cupar,” said he, and swashing in deeper than his waist, was hauled into the skiff, which was immediately directed for the ship."
"我站在他离开我的地方，双手反背在身后。艾伦坐在艇上转头望着我，小艇平稳地驶离了。突然我差点儿流下泪来，感觉自己是被遗弃在苏格兰的最孤独的青年。随后我转身背对着大海，面朝沙丘。看不见人影也听不到人声，太阳照耀在有湿有干的沙子上，风从荒原上吹过，海鸥发出一种单调的叫声。 我向海滩高处走去，沙蚤敏捷地在海岸边的乱草丛中跳跃。在那个不祥之地连鬼影子都看不到，也听不到任何声音。然而我知道那边有人在监视着我，带着某种隐秘的目的。他们绝不是士兵，否则早就袭击我并且把我带走了。他们绝对是一些受雇的普通流氓，想来坏我的事，也许是想绑架我，也许就想直接把我给杀了。 从那些参与此事的人的情况来看，更有可能是第一种人。从我对他们品性的了解以及他们对这桩事的热心来看，我认为第二种也很有可能。我的血都凉了，凉到心里去了。","I stood where he had left me, with my hands behind my back; Alan sat with his head turned watching me; and the boat drew smoothly away.Of a sudden I came the nearest hand to shedding tears, and seemed to myself the most deserted solitary lad in Scotland.With that I turned my back upon the sea and faced the sandhills.There was no sight or sound of man; the sun shone on the wet sand and the dry, the wind blew in the bents, the gulls made a dreary piping.As I passed higher up the beach, the sand-lice were hopping nimbly about the stranded tangles.The devil any other sight or sound in that unchancy place.And yet I knew there were folk there, observing me, upon some secret purpose.They were no soldiers, or they would have fallen on and taken us ere now; doubtless they were some common rogues hired for my undoing, perhaps to kidnap, perhaps to murder me outright.From the position of those engaged, the first was the more likely; from what I knew of their character and ardency in this business, I thought the second very possible; and the blood ran cold about my heart."
"我有一个疯狂的想法，想要拔出我剑鞘中的剑。因为虽然我极不适合像绅士那样勇敢地去刀剑相对，但是我认为在混乱的战斗中我也可以给对方造成一些损伤。但我马上意识到抵抗是种愚蠢行为。这无疑是普雷斯顿格兰奇和弗雷泽一致同意的联合“行动”。前者，我非常确定，已经做了一些事情来保全我的性命。而后者则极有可能已经给尼尔和其同伙的耳朵里透露了一些相反的暗示。要是我亮出兵刃，也许我就会直接落入我最可怕的敌人手里，那我注定要完蛋了。","I had a mad idea to loosen my sword in the scabbard; for though I was very unfit to stand up like a gentleman blade to blade, I thought I could do some scathe in a random combat.But I perceived in time the folly of resistance.This was no doubt the joint “expedient” on which Prestongrange and Fraser were agreed.The first, I was very sure, had done something to secure my life; the second was pretty likely to have slipped in some contrary hints into the ears of Neil and his companions; and it I were to show bare steel I might play straight into the hands of my worst enemy and seal my own doom."
"这么想着，我来到了海滩的顶端。我朝身后望了一眼，小艇正在靠近双桅船，艾伦在挥舞着手帕以示告别，对此我也挥了挥手作为回应。 艾伦本人在我的视野中缩成了一个小点儿，已经到我身前这个海角的出口旁边了。我把帽子紧扣在头上，咬紧牙关，径直朝我前面的环状沙堆上走去。因为陡峭，这个沙堆很难攀登，沙子就像脚下的水一样。不过最后我抓住了斜坡顶上那弯弯曲曲的长草，借此把自己拉到了一个合适的落脚点。 与此同时那些人行动了，东一个西一个地站了起来，有六、七个吧，是些衣衫破烂的地痞，每个人手里都握着一把匕首。情况很清楚，我闭上眼睛开始祈祷。 我再次睁开眼睛时，那帮流氓并没有朝我逼近多少，他们既不说话也不着急。所有的眼睛都看着我，给我一种奇怪的感觉，觉得他们的眼睛很亮，同时他们也害怕继续靠近我。我伸出空空的双手，于是有个人带着浓厚的高地口音问我是不是要投降。","These thoughts brought me to the head of the beach.I cast a look behind, the boat was nearing the brig, and Alan flew his handkerchief for a farewell, which I replied to with the waving of my hand.But Alan himself was shrunk to a small thing in my view, alongside of this pass that lay in front of me.I set my hat hard on my head, clenched my teeth, and went right before me up the face of the sand-wreath.It made a hard climb, being steep, and the sand like water underfoot.But I caught hold at last by the long bent-grass on the brae-top, and pulled myself to a good footing.The same moment men stirred and stood up here and there, six or seven of them, ragged-like knaves, each with a dagger in his hand.The fair truth is, I shut my eyes and prayed.When I opened them again, the rogues were crept the least thing nearer without speech or hurry.Every eye was upon mine, which struck me with a strange sensation of their brightness, and of the fear with which they continued to approach me.I held out my hands empty; whereupon one asked, with a strong Highland brogue, if I surrendered."
"“我抗议，”我说，“你们是否知道那个词的含义，我很怀疑这一点。”","“Under protest,” said I, “if ye ken what that means, which I misdoubt.”"
"听到那句话，他们就像一群鸟扑向腐肉一般，一拥而上扑向我，他们抓住我，拿走了我的剑，还拿走了我口袋里所有的钱，用粗大的绳索捆住我的手脚，然后把我丢在荒野中的一堆草丛里。在那里他们大致围成一个圈坐在他们的俘虏周围，默默注视着他，就像看着某样危险的东西，就像是脚上装了弹簧的一头狮子或者一只老虎。不久他们就放松了这种注意力。他们聚得更拢一些，开始用盖尔语交谈起来，颇具讽刺意味的是他们居然在我眼前就把我的财产给瓜分了。这个时候我感到安慰的是，从那个位置我可以看到我的朋友脱逃的过程。我看见小艇靠近了双桅船，然后被吊了上去，然后大船张满风帆，在小岛背后沿北贝里克郡驶向了外海。","At that word, they came all in upon me like a flight of birds upon a carrion, seized me, took my sword, and all the money from my pockets, bound me hand and foot with some strong line, and cast me on a tussock of bent.There they sat about their captive in a part of a circle and gazed upon him silently like something dangerous, perhaps a lion or a tiger on the spring.Presently this attention was relaxed.They drew nearer together, fell to speech in the Gaelic, and very cynically divided my property before my eyes.It was my diversion in this time that I could watch from my place the progress of my friend’s escape.I saw the boat come to the brig and be hoisted in, the sails fill, and the ship pass out seaward behind the isles and by North Berwick."
"在大约两个小时的时间内，越来越多衣衫褴褛的高地人不断地聚拢过来。尼尔属于最先到的，直到后来这伙人肯定有将近二十个了。每新来一个人就会有一轮新的谈话，听起来都像是在抱怨和解释。不过我却注意到一件事，就是那些晚来的人没有一个分到了从我这里掠夺去的战利品。最后的讨论非常激烈而热切，所以我一度都认为他们是吵架了。讨论近尾声时，这帮人散去了，大部分人成群结队向西返回，只有三个人，即尼尔和另外两个人留下来担任岗哨看管囚犯。","In the course of two hours or so, more and more ragged Highlandmen kept collecting.Neil among the first, until the party must have numbered near a score.With each new arrival there was a fresh bout of talk, that sounded like complaints and explanations; but I observed one thing, none of those who came late had any share in the division of my spoils.The last discussion was very violent and eager, so that once I thought they would have quarrelled; on the heels of which their company parted, the bulk of them returning westward in a troop, and only three, Neil and two others, remaining sentries on the prisoner."
"“我可以说出一个人的名字，这个人会对你们今天的作为极不满意，尼尔·邓肯森。”其他人走开以后，我说道。","“I could name one who would be very ill pleased with your day’s work, Neil Duncanson,” said I, when the rest had moved away."
"他答复我说，保证我会被善待，因为他知道我“和他的女主人相熟”。","He assured me in answer I should be tenderly used, for he knew he was “acquent wi’ the leddy.”"
"这就是我们所谈的全部内容，也没有其他任何人再出现在这片海岸上，直到太阳在高地群山之中落下，黄昏渐远，黑夜将至。那一刻才我注意到有一个洛锡安人骑着一匹农场的马穿过旷野朝我们走来，他身材颀长、消瘦，一副皮包骨的样子，面孔黑黝黝的。","This was all our talk, nor did any other son of man appear upon that portion of the coast until the sun had gone down among the Highland mountains, and the gloaming was beginning to grow dark.At which hour I was aware of a long, lean, bony-like Lothian man of a very swarthy countenance, that came towards us among the bents on a farm horse."
" “小伙子们，”他叫道，“你们有一份这样的文件吗？”他手里举着一份文件。尼尔立刻呈上了一份，来人借着一副牛角眼镜仔细阅读了，然后说一切无误，我们就是他在找的人，并立即下了马。随后我就被放到了他的马上，我的脚被捆在马肚子下，在这个低地人的引导下我们动身了。他走的这条路肯定是经过精心挑选的，因为整条路上我们只碰到了两个人——是一对恋人，而他们也许把我们当成了走私贩，一看到我们走近便逃走了。我们一度靠近南部的贝里克郡法院脚下，还有一次，在我们经过一些开阔的小山丘时，我发现了小村庄以及不远处小树林中教堂的古塔透出的点点灯光，但是都太远了无法呼救，就算我曾经想过要这么做的话。 最后我们再次听到了海浪的声音。当时有月光，虽然不是很亮。在月光下我可以看到坦特伦（雷德·道格拉斯的老首府）那三座巨大的城堡以及破损的城垛。马被拴在沟渠底的木桩上吃草，而我被带了进去，向前进了庭院，然后进入那个摇摇欲坠的石厅。在这里押解我的人就在人行道上生了一堆熊熊大火，因为夜晚很寒冷。我的手被松了绑，我被放在里面最当头的墙边，（那位低地人已经备好粮食）他给了我燕麦面包和一大罐法国白兰地酒。吃完之后，我又和那三个高地人单独在一起了。他们紧靠火堆旁坐着喝酒聊天，风从墙缝中吹进来，卷起阵阵浓烟，在城堡的顶端呼啸着。我可以听到悬崖下的海浪声，我内心已经对自己的生命安全打消了疑虑，而那天的忙碌也让我身心俱疲，我侧向一边就入睡了。","“Lads,” cried he, “has ye a paper like this?” and held up one in his hand.Neil produced a second, which the newcomer studied through a pair of horn spectacles, and saying all was right and we were the folk he was seeking, immediately dismounted.I was then set in his place, my feet tied under the horse’s belly, and we set forth under the guidance of the Lowlander.His path must have been very well chosen, for we met but one pair—a pair of lovers—the whole way, and these, perhaps taking us to be free-traders, fled on our approach.We were at one time close at the foot of Berwick Law on the south side; at another, as we passed over some open hills, I spied the lights of a clachan and the old tower of a church among some trees not far off, but too far to cry for help, if I had dreamed of it.At last we came again within sound of the sea.There was moonlight, though not much; and by this I could see the three huge towers and broken battlements of Tantallon, that old chief place of the Red Douglases.The horse was picketed in the bottom of the ditch to graze, and I was led within, and forth into the court, and thence into the tumble-down stone hall.Here my conductors built a brisk fire in the midst of the pavement, for there was a chill in the night.My hands were loosed, I was set by the wall in the inner end, and (the Lowlander having produced provisions) I was given oatmeal bread and a pitcher of French brandy.This done, I was left once more alone with my three Highlandmen.They sat close by the fire drinking and talking; the wind blew in by the breaches, cast about the smoke and flames, and sang in the tops of the towers; I could hear the sea under the cliffs, and, my mind being reassured as to my life, and my body and spirits wearied with the day’s employment, I turned upon one side and slumbered."
"我无法猜出我是什么时候被唤醒的，只是月亮已经低斜，火堆也快熄灭了。我的脚现在已经松绑了，我被带着穿过废墟，沿一条陡峭的小路下到悬崖边，在那里我发现有条渔船停在岩石围成的避风处。我就这样被带上了船，我们开始在美丽的星光下起航离开海岸。","I had no means of guessing at what hour I was wakened, only the moon was down and the fire was low.My feet were now loosed, and I was carried through the ruins and down the cliff-side by a precipitous path to where I found a fisher’s boat in a haven of the rocks.This I was had on board of, and we began to put forth from the shore in a fine starlight."
"第十四章 巴斯","CHAPTER XIV—THE BASS"
"我全然不知他们会把我带往何处，只是到处张望有没有船驶过。当时我脑海中闪过兰塞姆说的一个词——值二十镑的人们。 如果我要第二次面临先前那种被卖到种植园当奴隶的危险，我断定事情肯定会对我不利。不会有第二个艾伦，也不会有第二次海难以及闲置的院子可以指望了。我甚至看见了自己在鞭笞下种烟草的情景。这些想法让我不寒而栗，水面上的空气非常凛冽，小船的支架被寒露浸透了，我则在舵手身旁的位置上瑟瑟地发着抖。迄今在低地人中我只称呼过这个舵手为黑人，他名叫戴尔，人们通常称呼他布莱克·安迪。他感觉到我全身直打寒颤，于是非常和善地递给我一件满是鱼鳞的粗制夹克，我高兴地把这件夹克穿在了身上。","I had no thought where they were taking me; only looked here and there for the appearance of a ship; and there ran the while in my head a word of Ransome’s—the twenty-pounders.If I were to be exposed a second time to that same former danger of the plantations, I judged it must turn ill with me; there was no second Alan; and no second shipwreck and spare yard to be expected now; and I saw myself hoe tobacco under the whip’s lash.The thought chilled me; the air was sharp upon the water, the stretchers of the boat drenched with a cold dew: and I shivered in my place beside the steersman.This was the dark man whom I have called hitherto the Lowlander; his name was Dale, ordinarily called Black Andie.Feeling the thrill of my shiver, he very kindly handed me a rough jacket full of fish-scales, with which I was glad to cover myself."
"“我感谢您的这番好意，”我说，“我定会时刻铭记于心，力求报答的。您在这件事中非常负责任。您不像那些无知、野蛮的高地人，您知道法律是什么，也知道那些违法的人所冒的风险。”","“I thank you for this kindness,” said I, “and will make so free as to repay it with a warning.You take a high responsibility in this affair.You are not like these ignorant, barbarous Highlanders, but know what the law is and the risks of those that break it.”"
"“我不是很清楚你怎么会成为法律通缉的极端分子，”他说，“还是在你人生最得意的时候。不过在这件事上我是按照一份契约行事的。”","“I am no just exactly what ye would ca’ an extremist for the law,” says he, “at the best of times; but in this business I act with a good warranty.”"
"“你打算怎么处置我？”我问。","“What are you going to do with me?” I asked."
"“不会伤害你，”他说，“绝不会伤害你。我在想，你有强大的朋友。你也足够富有。”","“Nae harm,” said he, “nae harm ava’.Ye’ll have strong freens, I’m thinking.Ye’ll be richt eneuch yet.”"
"这时海面上开始落下一层灰幕，星星点点的粉红色和红色就像文火里燃烧的煤块一样，从东边显现了出来，与此同时那些鹅被唤醒了，于是开始在巴斯的顶端叫唤了起来。巴斯只是一座岩石悬崖，这一点人人皆知，但是这座悬崖很大，足以雕刻出一座城市来。 海浪特别小，但已在巨岩的底部周围冲击出了一处凹坑。随着黎明破晓，我可以越来越清楚地看见那座巨岩了。那笔直的峭壁绘满了海鸟粪，就像铺了一层晨霜一样，倾斜的峭壁顶端绿茵茵地布满了青草，成群的白鹅在悬崖的边缘鸣叫，而监狱的那些黢黑、残破的建筑物则紧靠在大海的边缘上。","There began to fall a greyness on the face of the sea; little dabs of pink and red, like coals of slow fire, came in the east; and at the same time the geese awakened, and began crying about the top of the Bass.It is just the one crag of rock, as everybody knows, but great enough to carve a city from.The sea was extremely little, but there went a hollow plowter round the base of it.With the growing of the dawn I could see it clearer and clearer; the straight crags painted with sea-birds’ droppings like a morning frost, the sloping top of it green with grass, the clan of white geese that cried about the sides, and the black, broken buildings of the prison sitting close on the sea’s edge."
"见此景象，我霎时明白真相了。","At the sight the truth came in upon me in a clap."
"“这就是你们带我去的地方！”我叫道。","“It’s there you’re taking me!” I cried."
"“只不过是去巴斯而已，小老弟，”他说，“在你之前有些老圣徒在那里呆过，我怀疑你到这里完全就是来坐牢的呢。”","“Just to the Bass, mannie,” said he: “Whaur the auld saints were afore ye, and I misdoubt if ye have come so fairly by your preeson.”"
"“但是现在没有人住在那里了，”我叫道,“那个地方早就是一片废墟了。”","“But none dwells there now,” I cried; “the place is long a ruin.”"
"“对那些塘鹅来说，这倒是个最为可喜的变化。”安迪冷冷地说道。","“It’ll be the mair pleisand a change for the solan geese, then,” quoth Andie dryly."
"天色慢慢变亮了，我注意到在船舱的底部，在一堆渔民用来压舱的大石头中间，有几个小桶和篮子，还有备用的燃料。所有这些都被卸下船运到悬崖峭壁上去了。 安迪，我，还有我那三个高地人（我称他们为我的，尽管是另外一种意义上的）一起登上了岸。小船再次划离时，太阳还没有升起。桨架上的船桨声从悬崖处传出回声，留下我们在这与世隔绝的地方被幽禁起来了。","The day coming slowly brighter I observed on the bilge, among the big stones with which fisherfolk ballast their boats, several kegs and baskets, and a provision of fuel.All these were discharged upon the crag.Andie, myself, and my three Highlanders (I call them mine, although it was the other way about), landed along with them.The sun was not yet up when the boat moved away again, the noise of the oars on the thole-pins echoing from the cliffs, and left us in our singular reclusion:"
"安迪·戴尔曾是巴斯的长官（我戏谑地这么称呼他），立刻就成了牧羊人兼那片小而富裕的土地的看守人。他得照料大约十二只羊，这些羊已经靠吃斜坡上的青草给养肥了，这些动物就像放牧在大教堂的屋顶上一样。此外他还负责照料栖息在峭壁上的那些塘鹅，他额外的收入正来源于此。仔鹅美味可口，通常的市价都达两先令一只，而且都是美食家们欣然前来付款的。即使老鹅也因为其油和羽毛而颇有价值。直到今天北贝里克郡的牧师们仍会花一部分津贴来付帐买塘鹅，这（在一些人的眼里）使该教区成为了一个人人梦寐以求的教区。为了履行好这几项职责，也为了保护这些塘鹅免遭偷猎，安迪时常睡在峭壁上与塘鹅一起共度时日。我们发现这个人在那里非常自在，就像农夫呆在自己的农场一样。他吩咐我们所有人都得背一些包裹，我急忙去帮忙做这件事，之后他带着我们从一扇上了锁的大门走进，这扇门是此岛唯一的入口。穿过堡垒的断垣残壁，就到达地方长官的住房了。通过烟囱里的灰烬以及房间角落里的一张卧榻，我们明白了那里就是他平常居住的地方。","Andie Dale was the Prefect (as I would jocularly call him) of the Bass, being at once the shepherd and the gamekeeper of that small and rich estate.He had to mind the dozen or so of sheep that fed and fattened on the grass of the sloping part of it, like beasts grazing the roof of a cathedral.He had charge besides of the solan geese that roosted in the crags; and from these an extraordinary income is derived.The young are dainty eating, as much as two shillings a-piece being a common price, and paid willingly by epicures; even the grown birds are valuable for their oil and feathers; and a part of the minister’s stipend of North Berwick is paid to this day in solan geese, which makes it (in some folks’ eyes) a parish to be coveted.To perform these several businesses, as well as to protect the geese from poachers, Andie had frequent occasion to sleep and pass days together on the crag; and we found the man at home there like a farmer in his steading.Bidding us all shoulder some of the packages, a matter in which I made haste to bear a hand, he led us in by a looked gate, which was the only admission to the island, and through the ruins of the fortress, to the governor’s house.There we saw by the ashes in the chimney and a standing bed-place in one corner, that he made his usual occupation."
"这张床，他现在主动提出来给我用，理由是他猜到我会提出要得到绅士待遇。","This bed he now offered me to use, saying he supposed I would set up to be gentry."
"“我的绅士身份和我睡的地方没有一点关系，”我说，“我要赞美主，我曾睡过艰苦的地方，现在可以怀着感激的心情再睡同样艰苦的地方。 我在这里的这段时间，安迪先生，如果那是你的名字的话，我会做好分内的事，和你们其他人在一起。不过另一方面我要请你宽恕我对你的嘲弄，对此我承认我是有点儿恶意。”","“My gentrice has nothing to do with where I lie,” said I.“I bless God I have lain hard ere now, and can do the same again with thankfulness.While I am here, Mr. Andie, if that be your name, I will do my part and take my place beside the rest of you; and I ask you on the other hand to spare me your mockery, which I own I like ill.”"
"听到这番话，他略微嘟囔了几句，但是似乎在表示赞同。的确，他是一位精明、明事理的人，还是一位善良的辉格党人和长老会成员。他每天都读袖珍《圣经》，既有能力又热心于认真讨论宗教信仰，颇倾向于长老会的极端行为。他的道德观带有一种较让人怀疑的色彩。我发现他做走私生意陷得很深，而且他还利用坦特伦的废墟作仓库来走私军火。 至于说收税官，我相信他认为这里的生活不值一文。但是洛锡安海岸的那块地方至今都还是荒蛮之地，那里的老百姓像苏格兰其他地方的一样粗野。","He grumbled a little at this speech, but seemed upon reflection to approve it.Indeed, he was a long-headed, sensible man, and a good Whig and Presbyterian; read daily in a pocket Bible, and was both able and eager to converse seriously on religion, leaning more than a little towards the Cameronian extremes.His morals were of a more doubtful colour.I found he was deep in the free trade, and used the rains of Tantallon for a magazine of smuggled merchandise.As for a gauger, I do not believe he valued the life of one at half-a-farthing.But that part of the coast of Lothian is to this day as wild a place, and the commons there as rough a crew, as any in Scotland."
"在我被关押期间发生的一件事情令人难以忘怀，因为这件事很久以后都还有影响。当时有一艘叫“海马”号的战舰就驻扎在海湾处，舰长是帕利泽。碰巧这艘战舰在九月份巡航，定期在法夫和洛锡安之间往返航行，并进行测量以防出现沉船危险。有一天清早，天气晴朗，在距我们东面约两英里的地方有人看到了该战舰，它放下一只小船，似乎是想查看磷火岩和魔鬼丛，那一带是海岸边出了名的危险区域。不久我们再次看到了那只小船，小船顺风而来，径直驶向了巴斯。这对安迪和那些高地人来说很棘手——我被扣押之事整个就是秘密进行的，而现在，一位海军舰长也许要鲁莽地登岸，就算事态不进一步恶化，这件事看样子也会被公开了。我势单力薄，又不像艾伦能以一当十，我对这艘战舰究竟是否会有可能改善我的处境完全没有底。方方面面都考虑了以后，我向安迪发誓一定好好表现，而且绝对顺从，然后我们脚步轻快地爬到岩石顶部，都在那里躺了下来，就在悬崖的边缘，不过观测点与隐蔽处各自不同。“海马”号笔直驶来，我觉得它已经要撞过来了，我们（头晕目眩地向下望去）可以看到舰上的水手们均各就各位，而且可以听到测深员在测水铅锤前的传报声。然后那军舰突然掉转方向并且发起了猛烈的炮击，我都不知道有多少大炮。岩石在雷鸣般的炮声中摇动，烟雾飘过我们的头顶，不计其数的塘鹅成群飞起，其数量之多令人难以置信。听到鹅群的尖叫声，看到鹅群闪烁的翅膀，使我感到无比好奇。我猜想帕利泽舰长靠巴斯这么近，只是为了满足这种有点儿孩子气的快感。为此他最终将付出不小的代价。在他靠近的过程中，我有机会观察到那艘舰上的索具，正因如此，后来我在数英里之外都认得出该舰。这种方法（在上帝的保佑下）也使我从一位朋友那里避开一场大灾难，并因对帕利泽舰长本人深感失望而痛心不已。","One incident of my imprisonment is made memorable by a consequence it had long after.There was a warship at this time stationed in the Firth, the Seahorse, Captain Palliser.It chanced she was cruising in the month of September, plying between Fife and Lothian, and sounding for sunk dangers.Early one fine morning she was seen about two miles to east of us, where she lowered a boat, and seemed to examine the Wildfire Rocks and Satan’s Bush, famous dangers of that coast.And presently after having got her boat again, she came before the wind and was headed directly for the Base.This was very troublesome to Andie and the Highlanders; the whole business of my sequestration was designed for privacy, and here, with a navy captain perhaps blundering ashore, it looked to become public enough, if it were nothing worse.I was in a minority of one, I am no Alan to fall upon so many, and I was far from sure that a warship was the least likely to improve my condition.All which considered, I gave Andie my parole of good behaviour and obedience, and was had briskly to the summit of the rock, where we all lay down, at the cliff’s edge, in different places of observation and concealment.The Seahorse came straight on till I thought she would have struck, and we (looking giddily down) could see the ship’s company at their quarters and hear the leadsman singing at the lead.Then she suddenly wore and let fly a volley of I know not how many great guns.The rock was shaken with the thunder of the sound, the smoke flowed over our heads, and the geese rose in number beyond computation or belief.To hear their screaming and to see the twinkling of their wings, made a most inimitable curiosity; and I suppose it was after this somewhat childish pleasure that Captain Palliser had come so near the Bass.He was to pay dear for it in time.During his approach I had the opportunity to make a remark upon the rigging of that ship by which I ever after knew it miles away; and this was a means (under Providence) of my averting from a friend a great calamity, and inflicting on Captain Palliser himself a sensible disappointment."
"我一直都呆在那块岩石上，我们生活得很好。我们有一些低度麦芽酒和白兰地，还有燕麦片，清早和夜晚我们都用燕麦片煮粥喝。不时有小船从卡斯尔顿过来，给我们带来四分之一头羊肉，因为岩石上的羊我们都不能碰，这是专门养来卖的。遗憾的是，那些塘鹅已经过了可以捕食的季节，我们也就随它们去。我们自己钓鱼，但更多的时候是让塘鹅为我们捕鱼。一注意到有一只塘鹅捕了鱼，就赶紧在它吞下之前夺过其猎物。","All the time of my stay on the rock we lived well.We had small ale and brandy, and oatmeal, of which we made our porridge night and morning.At times a boat came from the Castleton and brought us a quarter of mutton, for the sheep upon the rock we must not touch, these being specially fed to market.The geese were unfortunately out of season, and we let them be.We fished ourselves, and yet more often made the geese to fish for us: observing one when he had made a capture and searing him from his prey ere he had swallowed it."
"这个地方奇异的自然景观，以及由此造就的种种奇珍异玩，让我忙得不亦乐乎。因为不可能逃跑，所以我得以有完全的自由。于是凡是人迹可到之处，我都不断地去小岛的表面到处探险。监狱中的那座旧花园仍然值得观赏，鲜花和盆栽植物生长繁茂，在一丛灌木上还挂着一些熟樱桃。 在稍低洼之处伫立着一个小礼拜堂，或者是个修道室。那是由谁修建或者谁曾居住于此，都已经无人可以知晓了，想到其年代久远就足以引发许多遐想。那座监狱，我现在和那些高地山贼就一起露宿在那里，也是一处满载人文和神迹历史的地方。我觉得很奇怪，如此众多的圣徒和殉道者应该是最近才到过那里的，居然连一页他们的经书都没有留下，或者说在墙上居然连一个名字都没有刻。倒是那些粗鲁的士兵小伙子爬上城垛站岗值哨时，在附近到处留下了纪念物——大部分都是破烟斗，其数量之多令人惊讶，还有就是他们大衣上的金属钮扣。 有时候我觉得自己可能听见了地牢里传出的殉道者们虔诚地唱赞美诗的声音，看见了士兵们带着闪闪发光的风笛在城墙上踏步，当时黎明正从他们身后的北海升起。","The strange nature of this place, and the curiosities with which it abounded, held me busy and amused.Escape being impossible, I was allowed my entire liberty, and continually explored the surface of the isle wherever it might support the foot of man.The old garden of the prison was still to be observed, with flowers and pot-herbs running wild, and some ripe cherries on a bush.A little lower stood a chapel or a hermit’s cell; who built or dwelt in it, none may know, and the thought of its age made a ground of many meditations.The prison, too, where I now bivouacked with Highland cattle-thieves, was a place full of history, both human and divine.I thought it strange so many saints and martyrs should have gone by there so recently, and left not so much as a leaf out of their Bibles, or a name carved upon the wall, while the rough soldier lads that mounted guard upon the battlements had filled the neighbourhood with their mementoes—broken tobacco-pipes for the most part, and that in a surprising plenty, but also metal buttons from their coats.There were times when I thought I could have heard the pious sound of psalms out of the martyr’s dungeons, and seen the soldiers tramp the ramparts with their glinting pipes, and the dawn rising behind them out of the North Sea."
"无疑正是安迪和他讲的那些故事让我的头脑中充满了这些幻想。他特别熟悉和这块岩石有关的那个故事的种种细节，细致到列兵们的名字，因为他父亲就曾在那里当过同样的列兵。此外，他很有天赋，生来就有讲故事的才能，所以他讲的人物栩栩如生，似乎可以开口说话，他说的事情犹如发生在你面前。他的这份天赋加上我的专心听讲把我们拉在一起，让我们更亲近了。说老实话，我不能否认我喜欢他，不久我看出他也喜欢我。的确，最初我只是刻意想博得他的好感而已。偏僻的环境（就当前而言）造成的影响超出我的预料，但是还没过多久我们这对囚犯和看守竟成为了一对好朋友。","No doubt it was a good deal Andie and his tales that put these fancies in my head.He was extraordinarily well acquainted with the story of the rock in all particulars, down to the names of private soldiers, his father having served there in that same capacity.He was gifted besides with a natural genius for narration, so that the people seemed to speak and the things to be done before your face.This gift of his and my assiduity to listen brought us the more close together.I could not honestly deny but what I liked him; I soon saw that he liked me; and indeed, from the first I had set myself out to capture his good-will.An odd circumstance (to be told presently) effected this beyond my expectation; but even in early days we made a friendly pair to be a prisoner and his gaoler."
"如果我再装出一副呆在巴斯完全让人不愉快的样子，那就是昧着自己的良心了。在我看来这里是个安全的地方，好像我是逃到这里来摆脱麻烦的。没有东西能对我造成伤害。物质上来说就不可能，有岩石和深海，使我免遭新的阴谋设计。我感到我的生命很安全，我的声誉也安全，有时候我就任由自己像享受偷来的水那样自得其乐。但还有些时候我的想法则会截然不同，我会想起自己对兰基勒和斯图尔特曾经多么强烈地表白过。我会反思自己在巴斯上面的囚禁生活，只能看着法夫和洛锡安大部分的海岸，是一件我更应该想办法解决而不该长期忍耐的事情。至少在上面提到的两位绅士眼里，我肯定会被看成是一个只会吹牛的懦夫。 现在我对此却看得很淡。我告诉自己只要能赢得卡特里奥娜·德拉蒙德的芳心，其他人的意见都只是空谈和废话而已。于是乎我便抛下一切陷入对恋人的沉思冥想中，这倒是可以让自己满心欢愉，可在旁人看来我如此虚度光阴肯定非常惊讶。但是不久恐惧又促使我从另一个方面去考虑。我因自尊造成的巨大恐慌而内心动摇，看来这些想象中的严厉评判有可能大家都认为还公正呢。 随之就会产生另外一连串的想法，我刚一开始想到他人对我本人的评判，就不由想到了地牢里的詹姆斯·斯图尔特以及他妻子的哀号恸哭。于是，确实，激情开始在我心里燃起，我无法再原谅自己坐在这里无所事事了，就好像（如果我还是个真正的男子汉）我可以飞离或是游泳离开这个安全之地似的。我这么以自责为乐真是太滑稽可笑了，所以我就越发刻意地去赢得安迪·戴尔的好感。","I should trifle with my conscience if I pretended my stay upon the Bass was wholly disagreeable.It seemed to me a safe place, as though I was escaped there out of my troubles.No harm was to be offered me; a material impossibility, rock and the deep sea, prevented me from fresh attempts; I felt I had my life safe and my honour safe, and there were times when I allowed myself to gloat on them like stolen waters.At other times my thoughts were very different, I recalled how strong I had expressed myself both to Rankeillor and to Stewart; I reflected that my captivity upon the Bass, in view of a great part of the coasts of Fife and Lothian, was a thing I should be thought more likely to have invented than endured; and in the eyes of these two gentlemen, at least, I must pass for a boaster and a coward.Now I would take this lightly enough; tell myself that so long as I stood well with Catriona Drummond, the opinion of the rest of man was but moonshine and spilled water; and thence pass off into those meditations of a lover which are so delightful to himself and must always appear so surprisingly idle to a reader.But anon the fear would take me otherwise; I would be shaken with a perfect panic of self-esteem, and these supposed hard judgments appear an injustice impossible to be supported.With that another train of thought would he presented, and I had scarce begun to be concerned about men’s judgments of myself, than I was haunted with the remembrance of James Stewart in his dungeon and the lamentations of his wife.Then, indeed, passion began to work in me; I could not forgive myself to sit there idle: it seemed (if I were a man at all) that I could fly or swim out of my place of safety; and it was in such humours and to amuse my self-reproaches that I would set the more particularly to win the good side of Andie Dale."
"最后，在一个晴朗的早晨，当我们两个人单独在岩石顶上时，我隐隐向他暗示可以行贿。他看着我，把头往后一扬，朗声大笑起来。","At last, when we two were alone on the summit of the rock on a bright morning, I put in some hint about a bribe.He looked at me, cast back his head, and laughed out loud."
"“哎，你真有趣，戴尔先生，”我说，“但是也许只要瞟一眼那张票据，你就会改变口气的。”","“Ay, you’re funny, Mr. Dale,” said I, “but perhaps if you’ll glance an eye upon that paper you may change your note.”"
"那些愚蠢的高地人抓我的时候从我这里拿走的只是一些硬币，而我现在给安迪看的票据则是一份大不列颠利嫩公司开具的数额相当可观的提款单。","The stupid Highlanders had taken from me at the time of my seizure nothing but hard money, and the paper I now showed Andie was an acknowledgment from the British Linen Company for a considerable sum."
"他看了票据。“说真的，你根本不是做那种事的人。”他说。“我认为那张票据也许会改变你的看法。”我说。","He read it.“Troth, and ye’re nane sae ill aff,” said he.“I thought that would maybe vary your opinions,” said I."
"“嚯！”他说，“那说明你有能力行贿，但我是绝不受贿的。”","“Hout!” said he.“It shows me ye can bribe; but I’m no to be bribit.”"
"“我们过一会儿再讨论那件事，”我说，“首先，我要告诉你我知道我在跟你谈什么。你得到命令要把我扣留在这里直到9月21号星期四以后。”","“We’ll see about that yet a while,” says I.“And first, I’ll show you that I know what I am talking.You have orders to detain me here till after Thursday, 21st September.”"
"“你一点儿都没有弄错，”安迪说，“我会让你走的，拘禁命令要到23号星期六才会解除。”","“Ye’re no a’thegether wrong either,” says Andie.“I’m to let you gang, bar orders contrair, on Saturday, the 23rd.”"
"我不由地感觉到这种安排里面暗藏着极大的阴谋。那样我再次现身时正好错过按时出庭，那么即便我执意要陈述一番，人们也会更加怀疑我所述的事实。这么一想反倒激起了我的战斗意志。","I could not but feel there was something extremely insidious in this arrangement.That I was to re-appear precisely in time to be too late would cast the more discredit on my tale, if I were minded to tell one; and this screwed me to fighting point."
"“那么，安迪，既然你了解这个世界，就听我说说，边听边思考吧。”我说，“我知道这件事牵涉到一些大人物，而我也毫不怀疑你已经知晓他们的名字了。自打这件事一开始，我就已经见过其中的一些人了，而且我还当着他们的面说过我的想法。但是我犯的是一种什么样的罪呢？或者说我又触犯了一条什么样的律法呢？8月30日我被那些衣衫破烂的高地佬抓捕，被带到一堆古老的石头里。那个石头堆现在既不是堡垒也不是监狱（无论它曾经是什么），而只是巴斯岩石上那个猎场看守人的小屋。9月23日我又会再次被释放，和我第一次被捕时一样隐秘。你认为这听起来像是合法的吗？或者听起来还公正吗？或者说难道这听起来不正像是一桩让涉足其中的人感到羞耻的卑鄙龌龊的阴谋吗？”","“Now then, Andie, you that kens the world, listen to me, and think while ye listen,” said I.“I know there are great folks in the business, and I make no doubt you have their names to go upon.I have seen some of them myself since this affair began, and said my say into their faces too.But what kind of a crime would this be that I had committed? or what kind of a process is this that I am fallen under?To be apprehended by some ragged John-Hielandman on August 30th, carried to a rickle of old stones that is now neither fort nor gaol (whatever it once was) but just the gamekeeper’s lodge of the Bass Rock, and set free again, September 23rd, as secretly as I was first arrested—does that sound like law to you? or does it sound like justice? or does it not sound honestly like a piece of some low dirty intrigue, of which the very folk that meddle with it are ashamed?”"
"“我无法反驳你，肖斯。这桩事看起来特别卑劣无耻，”安迪说，“如果我们不是那种守规矩、地道的辉格党人和正统的长老会成员的话，我就会看出他们不是约旦人和耶路撒冷人了，或者我早就着手管这件事了。”","“I canna gainsay ye, Shaws.It looks unco underhand,” says Andie.“And werenae the folk guid sound Whigs and true-blue Presbyterians I would has seen them ayont Jordan and Jeroozlem or I would have set hand to it.”"
"“洛瓦特勋爵也是个优秀的辉格党人，”我说，“而且是一位主要的长老会成员。”","“The Master of Lovat’ll be a braw Whig,” says I, “and a grand Presbyterian.”"
"“我对他一无所知，”他说，“我和洛瓦特家族没有打过交道。”","“I ken naething by him,” said he.“I hae nae trokings wi’ Lovats.”"
"“不，你将要打交道的是普雷斯顿格兰奇。”我说。","“No, it’ll be Prestongrange that you’ll be dealing with,” said I."
"“啊，但是我不会告诉你那种事的。”安迪说。","“Ah, but I’ll no tell ye that,” said Andie."
"“我也没有什么必要去了解。”我反驳道。","“Little need when I ken,” was my retort."
"“只有一件事情是你可以肯定的，肖斯，”安迪说，“那就是（你尽可以试试）我不是在和你个人打交道，而且我将来也不会。”他补充说。","“There’s just the ae thing ye can be fairly sure of, Shaws,” says Andie.“And that is that (try as ye please) I’m no dealing wi’ yoursel’; nor yet I amnae goin’ to,” he added."
"“好吧，安迪，我知道我得和你把话说清楚。”我回答说。我告诉了他很多我认为有必要说的实际情况。","“Well, Andie, I see I’ll have to be speak out plain with you,” I replied.And told him so much as I thought needful of the facts."
"他相当认真地听我说，我说完以后，他似乎还独自思考了一阵。","He heard me out with some serious interest, and when I had done, seemed to consider a little with himself."
"“肖斯，”他最后说，“我只能赤手空拳来应对。照你说的这种情况，这件事是很奇怪，而且不是很可信。不过我完全不是在提醒你，那件事绝对不是你以为的那样。至于你本人，在我看来你似乎是一个颇为正派的年轻人。但是我年纪比你大而且也更为谨慎，也许在处事上看得比你要远一点点。现在这件事对你来说既清楚又简单。如果我把你留在这里，对你本人并没什么损害。不但不会有损害，我认为你这么做反而会处理得更好。对你的族人也没有什么损害——只不过多一个高地人被绞死而已——天知道，总算是摆脱了！另一方面，如果我把你给放了，对我可就会大为不利了。所以，我以一个合格的辉格党、一个忠诚的朋友的身份跟你说，也以一个担忧的朋友的身份告诉自己，事实很清楚，我认为你将不得不和安迪还有塘鹅一起呆在这里。”","“Shaws,” said he at last, “I’ll deal with the naked hand.It’s a queer tale, and no very creditable, the way you tell it; and I’m far frae minting that is other than the way that ye believe it.As for yoursel’, ye seem to me rather a dacent-like young man.But me, that’s aulder and mair judeecious, see perhaps a wee bit further forrit in the job than what ye can dae.And here the maitter clear and plain to ye.There’ll be nae skaith to yoursel’ if I keep ye here; far free that, I think ye’ll be a hantle better by it.There’ll be nae skaith to the kintry—just ae mair Hielantman hangit—Gude kens, a guid riddance!On the ither hand, it would be considerable skaith to me if I would let you free.Sae, speakin’ as a guid Whig, an honest freen’ to you, and an anxious freen’ to my ainsel’, the plain fact is that I think ye’ll just have to bide here wi’ Andie an’ the solans.”"
"“安迪，”我把手放在他的膝盖上说道，“这个高地人是无辜的。”","“Andie,” said I, laying my hand upon his knee, “this Hielantman’s innocent.”"
"“唉，那是很令人惋惜，”他说，“但是你看，在这个世界上，上帝就是这样造万物的，我们未必就可以得到我们想要的东西。”","“Ay, it’s a peety about that,” said he.“But ye see, in this warld, the way God made it, we cannae just get a’thing that we want.”"
"第十五章 布莱克·安迪关于托德·拉普莱克的故事","CHAPTER XV—BLACK ANDIE’S TALE OF TOD LAPRAIK"
"到现在为止，我还很少谈及那几个高地人。他们三个人全部都是詹姆斯·莫尔的随从，都和这桩事关他们主人性命的指控非常相关。他们都懂一两句英语，但是尼尔是唯一自认为足以进行一般交流的人，对此（在他登上船之后）他的同伴却常常持相反的看法。他们都是很顺从而单纯的人，从他们褴褛的衣衫和粗俗的样子来看，人们很难想到他们居然表现得这么殷勤有礼，自然而然就像是我和安迪的三个仆人了。","I have yet said little of the Highlanders.They were all three of the followers of James More, which bound the accusation very tight about their master’s neck.All understood a word or two of English, but Neil was the only one who judged he had enough of it for general converse, in which (when once he got embarked) his company was often tempted to the contrary opinion.They were tractable, simple creatures; showed much more courtesy than might have been expected from their raggedness and their uncouth appearance, and fell spontaneously to be like three servants for Andie and myself."
"住在这那个与世隔绝的地方，在古老坍塌的监狱废墟里，置身于海浪和海鸟那永无止境的怪异声音中，我觉得自己早就从中感觉到迷信导致的恐惧效果了。 在无事可做的时候，要么他们就会躺下来睡觉，他们的这种欲望好像永远不会满足似的，要么尼尔就会讲一些故事来让其他人开心，但是似乎讲的总是一些令人恐怖而紧张的故事。如果这两样都不能让大家高兴的话——或许有两个人在睡觉，而第三个人无论如何都无法像他们那样入睡——我就会看到他坐着、聆听、环顾周围，情绪逐渐不安起来，于是他的脸开始发白，双手紧握，整个人就像一张绷紧弦的弓。我一直没有弄清楚这种恐惧从何而来，但是看到他们那副样子也会受感染的，而且我们呆的这个地方本来就容易让人感到恐慌。我在英语中找不到词汇来描述这种恐慌，但是安迪却一直用同一个苏格兰的词语来表达这种感觉。","Dwelling in that isolated place, in the old falling ruins of a prison, and among endless strange sounds of the sea and the sea-birds, I thought I perceived in them early the effects of superstitious fear.When there was nothing doing they would either lie and sleep, for which their appetite appeared insatiable, or Neil would entertain the others with stories which seemed always of a terrifying strain.If neither of these delights were within reach—if perhaps two were sleeping and the third could find no means to follow their example—I would see him sit and listen and look about him in a progression of uneasiness, starting, his face blenching, his hands clutched, a man strung like a bow.The nature of these fears I had never an occasion to find out, but the sight of them was catching, and the nature of the place that we were in favourable to alarms.I can find no word for it in the English, but Andie had an expression for it in the Scots from which he never varied."
"“唉，”他会说，“巴斯，一个怪异的地方。” ","“Ay,” he would say, “its an unco place, the Bass.”"
"正是这样我总会想到这个词。这里夜晚怪异，白天也很怪异。还有很怪异的塘鹅的鸣叫声、海浪的拍击声，以及岩石的回声，都不断地在我们耳边回响。天气温和的时候，这里尤其怪异。当海浪巨大的时候，就会咆哮着撞击岩石，像雷声和军队的战鼓声一样，听起来既骇人又欢快。所以在平静的日子里，一个人听着听着就会吓到自己——不仅仅是高地人如此，因为我亲自实验过几次，各种低沉的噪声时常在岩石的回廊中萦绕，久久回响。","It is so I always think of it.It was an unco place by night, unco by day; and these were unco sounds, of the calling of the solans, and the plash of the sea and the rock echoes, that hung continually in our ears.It was chiefly so in moderate weather.When the waves were anyway great they roared about the rock like thunder and the drums of armies, dreadful but merry to hear; and it was in the calm days that a man could daunt himself with listening—not a Highlandman only, as I several times experimented on myself, so many still, hollow noises haunted and reverberated in the porches of the rock."
"这让我想起曾经听过的一个故事，以及我听故事时的情景，那个故事大大改变了我们的生活状态，对我离开那里也产生了极大的影响。事情发生在一天夜里，我在火堆旁陷入了沉思，（我回想起了艾伦教的那首小调）就开始吹起了口哨。一只手放到我的手臂上，是尼尔的声音叫我别吹了，因为那首曲调不是“吉祥的音乐”。","This brings me to a story I heard, and a scene I took part in, which quite changed our terms of living, and had a great effect on my departure.It chanced one night I fell in a muse beside the fire and (that little air of Alan’s coming back to my memory) began to whistle.A hand was laid upon my arm, and the voice of Neil bade me to stop, for it was not “canny musics.”"
"“不吉祥？”我问，“那怎么可能？”","“Not canny?” I asked.“How can that be?”"
"“喏，”他说，“这是一个妖怪唱的，而她是想要那个人项上的脑袋。”","“Na,” said he; “it will be made by a bogle and her wanting ta heid upon his body.”(1)"
"“嗯，”我说，“这里不可能有什么妖怪，尼尔，因为他们不可能有心思来吓唬塘鹅的。”","“Well,” said I, “there can be no bogles here, Neil; for it’s not likely they would fash themselves to frighten geese.”"
"“啊？”安迪说，“你居然是那么想的！但是我可以告诉你，这里就算没有妖怪，也有更厉害的。”","“Ay?” says Andie, “is that what ye think of it!But I’ll can tell ye there’s been waur nor bogles here.”"
"“什么会比妖怪更厉害，安迪？”我说。","“What’s waur than bogles, Andie?” said I."
"“巫师们。”他说，“或者说至少有一个巫师。那也是一个离奇的故事，”他补充说，“如果你们愿意听，我就讲给你们听。”","“Warlocks,” said he.“Or a warlock at the least of it.And that’s a queer tale, too,” he added.“And if ye would like, I’ll tell it ye.”"
"当然我们的想法都很一致，甚至连那三个高地人中英语最不济的那位都下定决心要竭尽全力地去听。","To be sure we were all of the one mind, and even the Highlander that had the least English of the three set himself to listen with all his might."
"托德·拉普莱克的故事","THE TALE OF TOD LAPRAIK"
"我的父亲，塔姆·戴尔，愿他在天之灵得到安息，年轻时曾是个野性十足、颇不安分的小子，既没有什么才智也没有什么德行。他好色、贪杯，喜欢狂欢纵饮。但是说起做诚实可敬的事情来，我却从没听说他有什么大的用处。他不停地换差事，最后还报名去当了兵，就驻守在这座堡垒里，戴尔家族到巴斯的第一个人就是以这种方式落脚的。那次服役可遭罪了！长官就只顾酿自己的酒，这似乎也太不可思议了。岩石上所需的供给都是从河流海滨运来的，但是出过一回船迷航的事，结果那段时间他们就只好靠捕鱼和射杀塘鹅为食了。 对整个王国来说，那段日子正在大搞宗教迫害。这个堡垒的死囚牢房里关满了圣徒和殉教者，关了多年，这件事根本就不值得那么做。尽管塔姆·戴尔带着一杆明火枪在那里，是一个单身大兵，正如我前面所说，他既好色又贪杯，但是这个人的头脑中倒不只是想着站岗的职责。他还想着苏格兰教会的荣耀，那段时间他看到上帝的圣徒误入歧途，为此他怒火丛生，同时也为自己还得拿着枪（或者扛着明火枪）参与如此黑暗的勾当而感到羞愧。每当夜晚他在这里站岗的时候，这个地方完全是个风口，也许是冬日的严寒撕裂了墙壁。他听到有一个囚犯开始唱起圣歌来，接着其余的人都加了进来，于是从不同的狱室或者地牢里都传来了唱赞美诗的声音，我完全可以说——结果海洋中的这座古老悬崖就好像是天堂的一个部分了。沉重的羞愧感压在了他的灵魂上，他的罪恶不断浮现在他面前，就像巴斯这块巨岩那么庞大，而他主要的罪孽就是参与了对基督教教会的破坏和捣乱。不过实际上他是在抵挡圣灵。白天到来，同伴们都起床了，而他已痛下决心要离开。","My faither, Tam Dale, peace to his banes, was a wild, sploring lad in his young days, wi’ little wisdom and little grace.He was fond of a lass and fond of a glass, and fond of a ran-dan; but I could never hear tell that he was muckle use for honest employment.Frae ae thing to anither, he listed at last for a sodger and was in the garrison of this fort, which was the first way that ony of the Dales cam to set foot upon the Bass.Sorrow upon that service!The governor brewed his ain ale; it seems it was the warst conceivable.The rock was proveesioned free the shore with vivers, the thing was ill-guided, and there were whiles when they but to fish and shoot solans for their diet.To crown a’, thir was the Days of the Persecution.The perishin’ cauld chalmers were all occupeed wi’ sants and martyrs, the saut of the yearth, of which it wasnae worthy.And though Tam Dale carried a firelock there, a single sodger, and liked a lass and a glass, as I was sayin,’ the mind of the man was mair just than set with his position.He had glints of the glory of the kirk; there were whiles when his dander rase to see the Lord’s sants misguided, and shame covered him that he should be haulding a can’le (or carrying a firelock) in so black a business.There were nights of it when he was here on sentry, the place a’ wheesht, the frosts o’ winter maybe riving in the wa’s, and he would hear ane o’ the prisoners strike up a psalm, and the rest join in, and the blessed sounds rising from the different chalmers—or dungeons, I would raither say—so that this auld craig in the sea was like a pairt of Heev’n.Black shame was on his saul; his sins hove up before him muckle as the Bass, and above a’, that chief sin, that he should have a hand in hagging and hashing at Christ’s Kirk.But the truth is that he resisted the spirit.Day cam, there were the rousing compainions, and his guid resolves depairtit."
"那些日子，在巴斯住着一位圣人，他的名字叫先知佩登。你们应该已经听人说过先知佩登的故事。从那以后就再也没有他的踪影，而很多人都弄不清楚从前是否曾有过他这么个人。他完全就像是一截泥炭，看起来吓人，听起来也吓人，他的神情就像是到了世界末日的审判。他的声音就像塘鹅的叫声一样在人们的耳边嗡嗡地响个不停，他说的话语就像炭火一样炙热烤人。","In thir days, dwalled upon the Bass a man of God, Peden the Prophet was his name.Ye’ll have heard tell of Prophet Peden.There was never the wale of him sinsyne, and it’s a question wi’ mony if there ever was his like afore.He was wild’s a peat-hag, fearsome to look at, fearsome to hear, his face like the day of judgment.The voice of him was like a solan’s and dinnle’d in folks’ lugs, and the words of him like coals of fire."
"当时岩石上有一位少女，而我认为她没什么事情可做，因为那根本不是正派女人呆的地方。不过她好像很漂亮，而且她和塔姆·戴尔一拍即合。事情是这样发生的：佩登正在花园里自己的小屋内做祷告，这时塔姆和那位少女走了过来，那少女做什么不好偏偏要大声笑着去嘲笑那位圣人的虔诚祷告？他起身看着他们两个人，塔姆一看到他的神情，膝盖就不停地磕碰打颤。但是他说话的时候，语气中透露的不是愤怒而是悲伤。“可怜的东西，可怜的东西！”他看着那少女说道，“我听到你尖叫着嘲笑我，”他说，“可是上帝已经为你备下死期，在那令人吃惊的审判时刻，你也会这样尖叫一次的！”之后不久她和两三个士兵在悬崖上漫步，那天天气很晴朗。突然一阵大风刮来，卷住了她的外套，连同她的提包和随身行李一起都给刮走了。而让那些士兵印象最深的就是她坠落时发出了一声尖叫。","Now there was a lass on the rock, and I think she had little to do, for it was nae place far decent weemen; but it seems she was bonny, and her and Tam Dale were very well agreed.It befell that Peden was in the gairden his lane at the praying when Tam and the lass cam by; and what should the lassie do but mock with laughter at the sant’s devotions?He rose and lookit at the twa o’ them, and Tam’s knees knoitered thegether at the look of him.But whan he spak, it was mair in sorrow than in anger.“Poor thing, poor thing!” says he, and it was the lass he lookit at, “I hear you skirl and laugh,” he says, “but the Lord has a deid shot prepared for you, and at that surprising judgment ye shall skirl but the ae time!”Shortly thereafter she was daundering on the craigs wi’ twa-three sodgers, and it was a blawy day.There cam a gowst of wind, claught her by the coats, and awa’ wi’ her bag and baggage.And it was remarked by the sodgers that she gied but the ae skirl."
"毫无疑问这个判决对塔姆·戴尔产生了一些影响。但是事情已经过去了，而他一点儿都没有好转。有一天他和另外一个士兵发生了争吵。“我碰到鬼了！”塔姆叫道，因为他喜欢用亵渎神灵的话来诅咒发誓。佩登就在那边盯着他看，眼神睿智而悲伤。佩登的长眉倒立、目光如炬，灰色的披肩在胸前飘拂，他伸出了手，指尖上是黑黑的指甲——因为他从来就不关注自己的身体。“嘿，嘿，可怜的人！”他叫道，“可怜而愚蠢的人！他居然说‘我碰到鬼了’，而我却看见魔鬼就在他的腋下。”相信自己有罪并渴望神的宽恕这种想法像深深的海洋一样淹没了塔姆，他掷下手中的长枪——“我将不再举起武器反抗基督的意志！”他说，结果也正应了神的话语。最初有一番激烈的争论，但是长官看到他决心已定，就同意让他退伍了。于是他就走了，在北贝里克郡定居并且结了婚，而且从那天起他与诚实的人们交往并赢得了自己的好名声。","Nae doubt this judgment had some weicht upon Tam Dale; but it passed again and him none the better.Ae day he was flyting wi’ anither sodger-lad.“Deil hae me!” quo’ Tam, for he was a profane swearer.And there was Peden glowering at him, gash an’ waefu’; Peden wi’ his lang chafts an’ luntin’ een, the maud happed about his kist, and the hand of him held out wi’ the black nails upon the finger-nebs—for he had nae care of the body.“Fy, fy, poor man!” cries he, “the poor fool man!Deil hae me, quo’ he; an’ I see the deil at his oxter.”The conviction of guilt and grace cam in on Tam like the deep sea; he flang doun the pike that was in his hands—“I will nae mair lift arms against the cause o’ Christ!” says he, and was as gude’s word.There was a sair fyke in the beginning, but the governor, seeing him resolved, gied him his discharge, and he went and dwallt and merried in North Berwick, and had aye a gude name with honest folk free that day on."
"巴斯是在1706年落入达隆勃莱家族手中的，当时有两个人负责管理这个地方。这两个人都能胜任，因为他们都当过驻防的士兵，都熟知捕猎塘鹅的门道、捕猎的时节及其价值。此外他们两个人都是——或者他们似乎都像是——认真的专业人员和善于交际的人。他们中的第一个就是塔姆·戴尔，我的父亲。 第二个就是拉普莱克，大多数时候人们称之为托德·拉普莱克，不过到底是因为他的名字还是因为他的脾性才这样称呼他，我就从来没有听人说过了。好，塔姆在拉普莱克行巫术的时候去找过他，还带了我，我那时还是个蹒跚学步、需要牵着手走的孩子。托德住在苏格兰教堂以北的一条深深的巷子里。那是条幽暗神秘的小巷，此外，那座教堂从詹姆斯六世起就一直名声不好，女王在海上的时候这里还闹过鬼。至于说托德的房屋，就在小巷子的最尽头，对此很了解的人都很不喜欢这里。那天大门敞开着，于是我和我父亲就径直走了进去。 托德在行巫术时是个织布工，他的织布机就立在客厅里。 他就坐在那里，是一个非常肥胖、皮肤苍白得就像抹了油脂的家伙。他的脸上带着一种诡异的微笑，让我看到就深感厌恶。他的手在吱吱嘎嘎地穿着梭子，但是他的双眼却紧紧地闭着。我们对着他喊他的名字，我们围在他那聋了似的耳朵边叫喊着，我们摇动着他的肩膀。根本就没有一点儿用！他就坐在他的纱卷堆上，吱吱嘎嘎地穿着梭子，脸上一副皮笑肉不笑的样子。","It was in the year seeventeen hunner and sax that the Bass cam in the hands o’ the Da’rymples, and there was twa men soucht the chairge of it.Baith were weel qualified, for they had baith been sodgers in the garrison, and kent the gate to handle solans, and the seasons and values of them.Forby that they were baith—or they baith seemed—earnest professors and men of comely conversation.The first of them was just Tam Dale, my faither.The second was ane Lapraik, whom the folk ca’d Tod Lapraik maistly, but whether for his name or his nature I could never hear tell.Weel, Tam gaed to see Lapraik upon this business, and took me, that was a toddlin’ laddie, by the hand.Tod had his dwallin’ in the lang loan benorth the kirkyaird.It’s a dark uncanny loan, forby that the kirk has aye had an ill name since the days o’ James the Saxt and the deevil’s cantrips played therein when the Queen was on the seas; and as for Tod’s house, it was in the mirkest end, and was little liked by some that kenned the best.The door was on the sneck that day, and me and my faither gaed straucht in.Tod was a wabster to his trade; his loom stood in the but.There he sat, a muckle fat, white hash of a man like creish, wi’ a kind of a holy smile that gart me scunner.The hand of him aye cawed the shuttle, but his een was steeked.We cried to him by his name, we skirted in the deid lug of him, we shook him by the shou’ther.Nae mainner o’ service!There he sat on his dowp, an’ cawed the shuttle and smiled like creish."
"“上帝指引我们，”塔姆·戴尔说，“这样不对劲吧？”","“God be guid to us,” says Tam Dale, “this is no canny?”"
"他刚一说完这句话，托德·拉普莱克就回过神来了。","He had jimp said the word, when Tod Lapraik cam to himsel’."
"“是你吗，塔姆？”他说，“嗨，伙计！见到你我很高兴。我有时候就会像这样陷入昏沉入梦的状态，”他说，“不过这是我的兴趣所在。”","“Is this you, Tam?” says he.“Haith, man!I’m blythe to see ye.I whiles fa’ into a bit dwam like this,” he says; “its frae the stamach.”"
"于是，他们就开始谈论巴斯，那是他们两个人都要去看守的地方，可是他们谈着谈着就恶语相向，两个人都生气了。我记得很清楚，我和父亲回家的时候，他一直都是同样一副表情，他很不喜欢托德·拉普莱克和他那昏沉入梦的样子。","Weel, they began to crack about the Bass and which of them twa was to get the warding o’t, and little by little cam to very ill words, and twined in anger.I mind weel that as my faither and me gaed hame again, he cam ower and ower the same expression, how little he likit Tod Lapraik and his dwams."
"“昏沉入梦！”他说，“我想人们看到你这种昏沉入梦的样子就会生气。”","“Dwam!” says he.“I think folk hae brunt for dwams like yon.”"
"就这样，我父亲得以管理巴斯，而托德只好不情愿地走了。自那以后他收拾东西的样子就留在了我的记忆中。“塔姆，”他说，“你比我强，得到的也多，而我希望，”他说，“你至少会找到你在巴斯所期望的一切。”这句话一直被认为是很不寻常的话语。终于到塔姆捕猎仔塘鹅的时候了。这是他非常熟悉而且擅长做的事，他从小就是一把攀岩好手，而且自信无比。所以他就这样凭着一根绳索，从悬崖的正面向上攀爬起来，虽然悬崖的正面既高又陡。几个做事谨慎的小伙子在崖顶上紧紧抓住绳子，注意着他的信号。但是塔姆悬靠的地方除了那峭壁别无他物，下面就是大海，塘鹅则在盘旋飞翔着。这是一个美好的春天的早晨，塔姆一边吹着口哨一边抓捕着仔鹅。我多次听他说过这段经历，他总是会紧张得满身大汗。","Aweel, my faither got the Bass and Tod had to go wantin’.It was remembered sinsyne what way he had ta’en the thing.“Tam,” says he, “ye hae gotten the better o’ me aince mair, and I hope,” says he, “ye’ll find at least a’ that ye expeckit at the Bass.”Which have since been thought remarkable expressions.At last the time came for Tam Dale to take young solans.This was a business he was weel used wi’, he had been a craigsman frae a laddie, and trustit nane but himsel’.So there was he hingin’ by a line an’ speldering on the craig face, whaur its hieest and steighest.Fower tenty lads were on the tap, hauldin’ the line and mindin’ for his signals.But whaur Tam hung there was naething but the craig, and the sea belaw, and the solans skirlin and flying.It was a braw spring morn, and Tam whustled as he claught in the young geese.Mony’s the time I’ve heard him tell of this experience, and aye the swat ran upon the man."
"你要知道，碰巧塔姆向上一看就发现有一只大塘鹅，那只塘鹅正在啄他的绳索。他按常规去想这件事，觉得这很不符合这种动物的习性。他想起绳索是特别软的东西，而塘鹅的尖嘴和巴斯的岩石都特别坚硬，况且两百英尺的高度也让他为之担心无比。","It chanced, ye see, that Tam keeked up, and he was awaur of a muckle solan, and the solan pyking at the line.He thocht this by-ordinar and outside the creature’s habits.He minded that ropes was unco saft things, and the solan’s neb and the Bass Rock unco hard, and that twa hunner feet were raither mair than he would care to fa’."
"“嘘！”塔姆说，“滚开，鸟儿！嘘，你滚开！”他说。","“Shoo!” says Tam.“Awa’, bird!Shoo, awa’ wi’ ye!” says he."
"那塘鹅朝下看着塔姆的脸，那家伙的眼中有种很怪异的东西。它只看了一眼，就又回去啄那绳索。但是现在它就像发狂一般拼命地啄。 从来没有哪只塘鹅像这只塘鹅那样使劲，而且它似乎非常清楚自己要做什么，它把那软软的绳子放在它的尖嘴和皱皱的岩石尖中间，想把绳子啄断。","The solan keekit doon into Tam’s face, and there was something unco in the creature’s ee.Just the ae keek it gied, and back to the rope.But now it wroucht and warstl’t like a thing dementit.There never was the solan made that wroucht as that solan wroucht; and it seemed to understand its employ brawly, birzing the saft rope between the neb of it and a crunkled jag o’ stane."
"由于恐惧，一阵寒意涌上塔姆的心头。“这家伙根本就不是鸟。”他想。他转回头双眼一望，他周围的天空已经变黑。“如果我在这里昏厥过去，”他想，“那我塔姆·戴尔就完了。”于是他发信号让伙伴把他拉上去。","There gaed a cauld stend o’ fear into Tam’s heart.“This thing is nae bird,” thinks he.His een turnt backward in his heid and the day gaed black aboot him.“If I get a dwam here,” he toucht, “it’s by wi’ Tam Dale.”And he signalled for the lads to pu’ him up."
"那只塘鹅似乎也懂得这些信号。因为刚一发出信号，那只塘鹅就放弃了绳索，展开翅膀，厉声鸣叫，盘旋着飞过来，并且直对着塔姆·戴尔的双眼猛扑了过来。塔姆有一把小刀，他把小刀打磨得寒光闪闪。好像那只塘鹅也知道小刀的厉害，因为钢刀一在阳光下闪亮发光，它便呱呱发出一声尖叫，不过倒是像失望的人发出的大笑声，然后绕着悬崖顶飞走了，塔姆就没有再看见它。那只塘鹅刚一飞走，塔姆的头就耷拉到了肩膀上，他的同伴就像拉一具死尸一样把他拉了上来，原来他已经昏倒在那悬崖峭壁上。","And it seemed the solan understood about signals.For nae sooner was the signal made than he let be the rope, spried his wings, squawked out loud, took a turn flying, and dashed straucht at Tam Dale’s een.Tam had a knife, he gart the cauld steel glitter.And it seemed the solan understood about knives, for nae suner did the steel glint in the sun than he gied the ae squawk, but laighter, like a body disappointit, and flegged aff about the roundness of the craig, and Tam saw him nae mair.And as sune as that thing was gane, Tam’s heid drapt upon his shouther, and they pu’d him up like a deid corp, dadding on the craig."
"灌下一杯白兰地（他从不离身的），他苏醒了过来，或者说捡回了半条命。他坐了起来。","A dram of brandy (which he went never without) broucht him to his mind, or what was left of it.Up he sat."
"“快跑。乔迪，跑到船那里去，务必看好船，伙计——快跑！”他叫道，“否则那只塘鹅会把船弄走的。”他说。","“Rin, Geordie, rin to the boat, mak’ sure of the boat, man—rin!” he cries, “or yon solan’ll have it awa’,” says he."
"那几个年轻人面面相觑，设法想让他安静下来。但是做什么都不能让塔姆·戴尔满意，直到其中一个人动身前去看守那艘船。其他人问他是否还要再下悬崖。","The fower lads stared at ither, an’ tried to whilly-wha him to be quiet.But naething would satisfy Tam Dale, till ane o’ them had startit on aheid to stand sentry on the boat.The ithers askit if he was for down again."
"“不，”他说，“不论是你们还是我都不要下去了，”他说，“我的双脚一能够站稳，我们就赶紧离开这魔鬼般的悬崖。”","“Na,” says he, “and niether you nor me,” says he, “and as sune as I can win to stand on my twa feet we’ll be aff frae this craig o’ Sawtan.”"
"果然，时间已经不容耽搁，否则后果会更加严重，因为他们还没赶到北贝里克郡，塔姆就已经在发高烧说胡话了。他躺在床上昏迷不醒，而好心前来看望他的竟然是托德·拉普莱克！人们后来想到每次托德走近塔姆的家，塔姆的高烧就会恶化。我不了解那件事情。但是我特别清楚那件事最后的结局。","Sure eneuch, nae time was lost, and that was ower muckle; for before they won to North Berwick Tam was in a crying fever.He lay a’ the simmer; and wha was sae kind as come speiring for him, but Tod Lapraik!Folk thocht afterwards that ilka time Tod cam near the house the fever had worsened.I kenna for that; but what I ken the best, that was the end of it."
"那一年大概就是这个时候，我的祖父出海去捕鱼，我还是个孩子，只能跟着他一起去。我们收获很大，我记得，鱼群所在的路线带我们靠近巴斯附近，在那里我们和另一条船相会，那条船属于卡斯尔顿一个名叫桑迪·弗莱彻的人。他不久前才过世的，要不你都可以去问他本人！好了，桑迪当时大喊着。","It was about this time o’ the year; my grandfaither was out at the white fishing; and like a bairn, I but to gang wi’ him.We had a grand take, I mind, and the way that the fish lay broucht us near in by the Bass, whaur we foregaithered wi’ anither boat that belanged to a man Sandie Fletcher in Castleton.He’s no lang deid neither, or ye could speir at himsel’.Weel, Sandie hailed."
"“巴斯上面有什么？”他说。","“What’s yon on the Bass?” says he."
"“巴斯上面吗？”我祖父说。","“On the Bass?” says grandfaither."
"“对，”桑迪说，“在绿色的那边。”","“Ay,” says Sandie, “on the green side o’t.”"
"“一种什么样的东西？”我祖父说，“巴斯上面除了羊就不可能再有什么了。”","“Whatten kind of a thing?” says grandfaither.“There cannae be naething on the Bass but just the sheep.”"
"“它看起来很怪异，像是一个人。”桑迪说，他靠得更近一些。","“It looks unco like a body,” quo’ Sandie, who was nearer in."
"“一个人！”我们说，我们没有一个人愿意相信。因为根本没有船可以把人带到那里去，而监狱的钥匙还挂在我父亲的脖子上，他正躺在家里的病床上呢。","“A body!” says we, and we none of us likit that.For there was nae boat that could have brought a man, and the key o’ the prison yett hung ower my faither’s at hame in the press bed."
"我们把两条船靠近互相结伴，然后又向悬崖靠近了一些。祖父有副望远镜，因为他曾经当过水手，而且是一艘单桅船的船长，不过那艘船在泰湾沙滩失事了。我们拿望远镜对着它看，果然那里是有一个人。他在绿色山坡上的一个洼地处，就在小礼拜堂下面一点点，他独自一人狂蹦乱跳、挥来舞去、手舞足蹈，就像一个在婚礼上疯狂嬉戏的傻姑娘。","We keept the twa boats close for company, and crap in nearer hand.Grandfaither had a gless, for he had been a sailor, and the captain of a smack, and had lost her on the sands of Tay.And when we took the glass to it, sure eneuch there was a man.He was in a crunkle o’ green brae, a wee below the chaipel, a’ by his lee lane, and lowped and flang and danced like a daft quean at a waddin’."
"“那是托德。”祖父说，并把望远镜递给了桑迪。","“It’s Tod,” says grandfather, and passed the gless to Sandie."
"“对，就是他。”桑迪说。“要么就是一个跟他很像的人。”祖父说。","“Ay, it’s him,” says Sandie.“Or ane in the likeness o’ him,” says grandfaither."
"“是有些不一样。”桑迪说。“是魔鬼还是巫师，我对他开枪试试看。”他说，然后拿出了一支他总是带在身边的猎枪，要知道桑迪曾经是全国著名的神枪手。","“Sma’ is the differ,” quo’ Sandie.“De’il or warlock, I’ll try the gun at him,” quo’ he, and broucht up a fowling-piece that he aye carried, for Sandie was a notable famous shot in all that country."
"“住手，桑迪，”祖父说，“我们必须先看清楚，”他说，“否则对我们两个人来说这可能就是最痛苦的一天。”","“Haud your hand, Sandie,” says grandfaither; “we maun see clearer first,” says he, “or this may be a dear day’s wark to the baith of us.”"
"“啧！”桑迪说，“这肯定是主的判决，这家伙该死。”他说。","“Hout!” says Sandie, “this is the Lord’s judgment surely, and be damned to it,” says he."
"“也许是，也许不是。”我祖父说。多么可敬的人啊！“可是你还记得那个地方检察官吗？我想你可能已经把之前的事给忘了。”他说。","“Maybe ay, and maybe no,” says my grandfaither, worthy man!“But have you a mind of the Procurator Fiscal, that I think ye’ll have foregaithered wi’ before,” says he."
"这是真的，桑迪曾因一件小事而被起诉过。“好吧，伊迪，”他说，“那你会有什么办法？”","This was ower true, and Sandie was a wee thing set ajee.“Aweel, Edie,” says he, “and what would be your way of it?”"
"“哦，这样吧，”祖父说，“我的船最快，让我驾船回北贝里克郡，你就守在这里监视那个家伙。如果我找不到拉普莱特，我会赶来和你会合，然后我们两个一起干掉他。但是如果拉普莱特在家的话，我就会在港口升起小旗子，然后你就可以试着用枪射击那个怪物。”","“Ou, just this,” says grandfaither.“Let me that has the fastest boat gang back to North Berwick, and let you bide here and keep an eye on Thon.If I cannae find Lapraik, I’ll join ye and the twa of us’ll have a crack wi’ him.But if Lapraik’s at hame, I’ll rin up the flag at the harbour, and ye can try Thon Thing wi’ the gun.”"
"好，就这样他们两个人达成了一致意见。我还只是个小孩，就静静地呆在桑迪的船上，我以为在那里我会看到最好看的事情。我祖父给了桑迪一枚小银币，和铅弹一起上进枪膛里，这样就会给妖怪更加致命的一击。然后一艘船出发去了北贝里克郡，另外一艘船则呆在原地，监视着斜坡上的那个怪物。","Aweel, so it was agreed between them twa.I was just a bairn, an’ clum in Sandie’s boat, whaur I thoucht I would see the best of the employ.My grandsire gied Sandie a siller tester to pit in his gun wi’ the leid draps, bein mair deidly again bogles.And then the as boat set aff for North Berwick, an’ the tither lay whaur it was and watched the wanchancy thing on the brae-side."
"我们停泊在那里的时候，那个怪物一直在狂蹦乱跳、挥来舞去，他蹦蹦跳跳、转来转去，就像一个陀螺，有时候我们都能听见它跳跳转转时的踢踏声。我曾见过一些姑娘，是一些傻乎乎的姑娘，在寒冬的夜里狂蹦乱跳、手舞足蹈，而且当寒冬的白天来临时，他们还在狂跳，还在乱舞。但是那里会有人与她们为伴，而且有小伙子在鼓动着她们，可是这个家伙却是独自一个人。那些姑娘跳舞时，会有小提琴手在烟囱旁边轻快地移动着手肘为她们伴奏；可是这个家伙却没有音乐，相伴的只有塘鹅的鸣叫声。那些姑娘都还青春年少，而且是跟同伴们站在一起；可是这个家伙却硕大、肥胖、满脸油腻，而且已经步入垂暮之年。你想怎么说就怎么说，我只说我所相信的事情。那怪物的内心充满喜悦，邪恶的喜悦，我认为那是无与伦比的喜悦。我问过自己很多次，为什么巫婆和巫师愿意出卖自己的灵魂（那可是他们最宝贵的东西 ）而成为衰老、衣衫破烂、满脸皱纹的老太婆，或者老迈、衰弱无用、蹒跚而行的老头子？由此我想到了托德·拉普莱克可以一连几个小时地独自狂舞，他的内心一定充满了黑暗的辉煌。无疑他们的内心熊熊燃烧着地狱之火，但是无论如何他们在这里也有着美好的时光！愿主宽恕我们！","A’ the time we lay there it lowped and flang and capered and span like a teetotum, and whiles we could hear it skelloch as it span.I hae seen lassies, the daft queans, that would lowp and dance a winter’s nicht, and still be lowping and dancing when the winter’s day cam in.But there would be fowk there to hauld them company, and the lads to egg them on; and this thing was its lee-lane.And there would be a fiddler diddling his elbock in the chimney-side; and this thing had nae music but the skirling of the solans.And the lassies were bits o’ young things wi’ the reid life dinnling and stending in their members; and this was a muckle, fat, creishy man, and him fa’n in the vale o’ years.Say what ye like, I maun say what I believe.It was joy was in the creature’s heart, the joy o’ hell, I daursay: joy whatever.Mony a time I have askit mysel’ why witches and warlocks should sell their sauls (whilk are their maist dear possessions) and be auld, duddy, wrunkl’t wives or auld, feckless, doddered men; and then I mind upon Tod Lapraik dancing a’ the hours by his lane in the black glory of his heart.Nae doubt they burn for it muckle in hell, but they have a grand time here of it, whatever!—and the Lord forgie us!"
"好，到最后，我们看见有面小旗子升到了海港岩石上的桅杆顶。那正是桑迪所等待的。他抬起枪，不慌不忙地瞄准目标，扣动了扳机。“呯”的一声枪响，接着从巴斯上面传出了一声惨叫。我们一边擦着眼睛，一边像傻瓜一样一个劲地往那边瞧。因为随着那声枪响和尖叫声，那个怪物就消失得无影无踪了。阳光在照耀，海风在吹拂，那片地方却空荡荡的，而就在一秒钟前那个怪物还在那里狂跳乱舞。","Weel, at the hinder end, we saw the wee flag yirk up to the mast-heid upon the harbour rocks.That was a’ Sandie waited for.He up wi’ the gun, took a deleeberate aim, an’ pu’d the trigger.There cam’ a bang and then ae waefu’ skirl frae the Bass.And there were we rubbin’ our een and lookin’ at ither like daft folk.For wi’ the bang and the skirl the thing had clean disappeared.The sun glintit, the wund blew, and there was the bare yaird whaur the Wonder had been lowping and flinging but ae second syne."
"在回家的路上我一直大声哭嚎、呜咽着，带着对那种天命的恐惧。那个成年人也不见得比我强多少。桑迪在他的船上几乎没开口说话，只是一个劲地念着上帝的圣名。我们回到码头时，港口的岩石上黑压压一片都是在等候我们的人群。看来他们已经发现拉普莱克又一次昏沉入梦了，他穿着梭子在微笑。他们派一位小年轻去升起了旗子，其余的人则在那织布工的家里等候。你可以肯定他们不喜欢那个地方，但是让那几个人站在那里一边为自己祷告（因为没人愿意大声地祷告出来），一边看着那可怕的怪物穿着梭子，这也不失为一种优雅的办法。随后，突然伴随一声可怕的撞击声，托德从他坐的地方跳了起来，然后向前摔倒在织布机上，成为了一具血淋淋的尸体。","The hale way hame I roared and grat wi’ the terror o’ that dispensation.The grawn folk were nane sae muckle better; there was little said in Sandie’s boat but just the name of God; and when we won in by the pier, the harbour rocks were fair black wi’ the folk waitin’ us.It seems they had fund Lapraik in ane of his dwams, cawing the shuttle and smiling.Ae lad they sent to hoist the flag, and the rest abode there in the wabster’s house.You may be sure they liked it little; but it was a means of grace to severals that stood there praying in to themsel’s (for nane cared to pray out loud) and looking on thon awesome thing as it cawed the shuttle.Syne, upon a suddenty, and wi’ the ae dreidfu’ skelloch, Tod sprang up frae his hinderlands and fell forrit on the wab, a bluidy corp."
"人们在检查那具尸体时，发现那些铅弹并没有击中那个巫师的身体，很遗憾连一粒铅弹都没有找到！但是祖父的那枚银币却正中了那个织布工的心脏。","When the corp was examined the leid draps hadnae played buff upon the warlock’s body; sorrow a leid drap was to be fund! but there was grandfaither’s siller tester in the puddock’s heart of him."
"安迪的故事刚一讲完，其结局就显示出所讲述的事情非常荒唐可笑。我已经说过，尼尔本身就是个很会讲故事的人。我听说他熟知高地所有的故事，因此也颇为自负，而且他的能力也被其他人所认同。现在安迪的故事让他想起了一个他曾听过的故事。","Andie had scarce done when there befell a mighty silly affair that had its consequence.Neil, as I have said, was himself a great narrator.I have heard since that he knew all the stories in the Highlands; and thought much of himself, and was thought much of by others on the strength of it.Now Andie’s tale reminded him of one he had already heard."
"“她从前就知道那个故事。”他说，“这就是乌斯汀·莫尔·马吉利·菲特里和盖弗·沃尔的故事。”","“She would ken that story afore,” he said.“She was the story of Uistean More M’Gillie Phadrig and the Gavar Vore.”"
"“根本就不是同一个故事。”安迪叫道，“这是我父亲（现在已与上帝同在）和托德·拉普莱克的故事。这就像你的胡须一样真切。”他说，“闭上你高地人的嘴，不要乱嚼舌头！”","“It is no sic a thing,” cried Andie.“It is the story of my faither (now wi’ God) and Tod Lapraik.And the same in your beard,” says he; “and keep the tongue of ye inside your Hielant chafts!”"
"人们会发现，而且历史也已经表明，苏格兰低地的绅士是如何对待高地人的。不过这一次低地人通常的做法看样子是行不通了。我早已经注意到安迪不断地挑起与那三个麦格雷戈人的争执，而现在，果不其然，又争执起来了。","In dealing with Highlanders it will be found, and has been shown in history, how well it goes with Lowland gentlefolk; but the thing appears scarce feasible for Lowland commons.I had already remarked that Andie was continually on the point of quarrelling with our three MacGregors, and now, sure enough, it was to come."
"“绅士对此无话可说。”尼尔说。","“Thir will be no words to use to shentlemans,” says Neil."
"“绅士！”安迪叫道，“绅士，你这头高地蠢牛！如果上帝仁慈，让你看到别人是怎么看待你们的，你会气得吐血。”","“Shentlemans!” cries Andie.“Shentlemans, ye hielant stot!If God would give ye the grace to see yoursel’ the way that ithers see ye, ye would throw your denner up.”"
"尼尔冒出一句盖尔人的诅咒，同时把黑色的刀子握在了手中。","There came some kind of a Gaelic oath from Neil, and the black knife was in his hand that moment."
"根本没有时间考虑，我就抱住了那个高地人的腿，甚至还不知道自己在做什么，我就已经把他扑倒在地，并且卡住了他拿着刀的手。 他的同伴跳起来去救他，我和安迪都没有武器，格里格拉人却是三比二占优势。似乎我们已经获救无望，但这时尼尔用自己的语言高喊了一声，命令其他人往后退，并且以一种最卑贱的姿态向我表示臣服，甚至还把他的刀交给了我，（在他再次作出保证后）我第二天就把那把刀还给他了。","There was no time to think; and I caught the Highlander by the leg, and had him down, and his armed hand pinned out, before I knew what I was doing.His comrades sprang to rescue him, Andie and I were without weapons, the Gregara three to two.It seemed we were beyond salvation, when Neil screamed in his own tongue, ordering the others back, and made his submission to myself in a manner the most abject, even giving me up his knife which (upon a repetition of his promises) I returned to him on the morrow."
"有两件事情我看得很清楚了：第一，我不能过多地指望安迪，他已经缩到墙边，靠墙站着，一直到这件事情结束，脸色像死人一样惨白；第二，我的地位比那些高地人更优越，那些高地人肯定是特别受雇要保护我的安全的。不过如果我认为安迪没有表现出可嘉的勇气的话，那我不再以感激之心对待他，错就不在我了。我不会再因为对他感激颇多而感到困扰，他的思想和行为方式看起来都已经发生了变化。因为从那以后我们相伴时他一直都显得非常胆怯，我和他反倒时常呆在一起了。（1）我熟悉的一位博学的民间文学专家曾考证过艾伦的曲调。这首曲调（似乎是）刊印在坎贝尔的《西部高地故事》第2卷第91页。经仔细核查，格兰特小姐那首不押韵的打油诗（见第五章）确实好像和所讨论的这种曲调颇为吻合，只是有那么一点点语带诙谐而已。","Two things I saw plain: the first, that I must not build too high on Andie, who had shrunk against the wall and stood there, as pale as death, till the affair was over; the second, the strength of my own position with the Highlanders, who must have received extraordinary charges to be tender of my safety.But if I thought Andie came not very well out in courage, I had no fault to find with him upon the account of gratitude.It was not so much that he troubled me with thanks, as that his whole mind and manner appeared changed; and as he preserved ever after a great timidity of our companions, he and I were yet more constantly together.(1)A learned folklorist of my acquaintance hereby identifies Alan’s air. It has been printed (it seems) in Campbell’s Tales of the West Highlands, Vol. II., p. 91.Upon examination it would really seem as if Miss Grant’s unrhymed doggrel (see Chapter V.) would fit with little humouring to the notes in question."
"第十六章 失踪的证人","CHAPTER XVI—THE MISSING WITNESS"
"在17号那天，即我和大律师约见的日子，我要对命运作出更多的抗争。想到他在“皇家军械”店里等着我，想到他会怎么想，想到我们下一次见面时他会怎么说，都让我备受煎熬。这个事实太令人难以置信了，可我还不得不承认。给我扣上骗子和懦夫的帽子，但是我从来就不曾刻意逃避所有可能是我应该做的事情，这样做似乎很残酷。我悲戚地重复着这些字眼，就那样再次审视着我行为的各个步骤。我的行为好像已经把詹姆斯·斯图尔特看成是兄弟了。过去的一切都是我值得骄傲的一幕，只有当前才是我需要考虑的。我不可能游过大海，也不可能飞翔在空中，不过安迪总是在我身旁。我曾帮助过他，他喜欢我，所以我可以借此对他再做做工作。就算只是出于情理，我也必须再试一次去说服安迪。","On the seventeenth, the day I was trysted with the Writer, I had much rebellion against fate.The thought of him waiting in the King’s Arms, and of what he would think, and what he would say when next we met, tormented and oppressed me.The truth was unbelievable, so much I had to grant, and it seemed cruel hard I should be posted as a liar and a coward, and have never consciously omitted what it was possible that I should do.I repeated this form of words with a kind of bitter relish, and re-examined in that light the steps of my behaviour.It seemed I had behaved to James Stewart as a brother might; all the past was a picture that I could be proud of, and there was only the present to consider.I could not swim the sea, nor yet fly in the air, but there was always Andie.I had done him a service, he liked me; I had a lever there to work on; if it were just for decency, I must try once more with Andie."
"那是下午接近傍晚的时侯，整个巴斯一片寂静，只有宁静的大海轻拍海岸的声音和浪花溅出的泡沫声。我的四个伙伴都已经分散爬开，那三个麦格雷戈家的人在岩石的高处，安迪则带着他的《圣经》在废墟中一处向阳的地方。我发现他在那里睡得很熟，不过，他一醒来就会摆出一副热情善辩的样子来吸引大家的注意力。","It was late afternoon; there was no sound in all the Bass but the lap and bubble of a very quiet sea; and my four companions were all crept apart, the three Macgregors higher on the rock, and Andie with his Bible to a sunny place among the ruins; there I found him in deep sleep, and, as soon as he was awake, appealed to him with some fervour of manner and a good show of argument."
"“如果我认为这对你有好处的话，肖斯！”他说，透过眼镜直盯着我。","“If I thoucht it was to do guid to ye, Shaws!” said he, staring at me over his spectacles."
"“这样可以救另外一个人，”我说，“而且可以履行我的诺言。还有什么会比那样更好呢？难道你不记得经上的话了吗，安迪？在你膝盖上就有本《圣经》！人就是赚得全世界，又有什么益处呢？”","“It’s to save another,” said I, “and to redeem my word.What would be more good than that?Do ye no mind the scripture, Andie?And you with the Book upon your lap!What shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world?”"
"“是啊，”他说，“那对你是很重要。但是我凭什么要掺和进来！和你一样，我也有誓言要履行。而你现在要我做什么，只不过为了钱就背弃我的誓言吗？”","“Ay,” said he, “that’s grand for you.But where do I come in!I have my word to redeem the same’s yoursel’.And what are ye asking me to do, but just to sell it ye for siller?”"
"“安迪！我提到过钱这个字吗？”我叫道。","“Andie! have I named the name of siller?” cried I."
"“哦，那个字是不算什么，”他说，“但不管怎样，事情是明摆在那里的。这件事到头来无非就是这样，如果按照你提议的方式去帮助你，那我就会失去自己的生计。 那么很明显，你就不得不给我补偿，还要多给一点，也为了你自己的信用。如果不是贿赂，那还会是什么呢？甚至可以说我肯定就是受贿了！但是就我所知，还远远没有到那一步。如果你将被绞死的话，那我又将身在何处？不，这件事绝不可能。 还是像个好青年的样子，走开吧！让安迪读完他这一章。”","“Ou, the name’s naething”, said he; “the thing is there, whatever.It just comes to this; if I am to service ye the way that you propose, I’ll lose my lifelihood.Then it’s clear ye’ll have to make it up to me, and a pickle mair, for your ain credit like.And what’s that but just a bribe?And if even I was certain of the bribe!But by a’ that I can learn, it’s far frae that; and if you were to hang, where would I be?Na: the thing’s no possible.And just awa’ wi’ ye like a bonny lad! and let Andie read his chapter.”"
"我记得我从心底对这个结果非常满意。接下来令人好笑的是我居然陷入了一种（我几乎可以说）对普雷斯顿格兰奇的感激之中，他救了我，以这种暴力、不合法的方式，却让我脱离了种种危险、诱惑和困惑。但是这种想法过于脆弱又太懦弱，不能持续多久，而对詹姆斯的回忆开始成功地占据我的心灵。21号是审判日，那一天我都满心愁绪，在我的记忆中，也许除了在伊雷德岛上的日子之外，我几乎就没有忍受过这种痛苦了。很多时候我就半睡半醒地躺在斜坡上，身体一动不动，但脑海中充满了各种激烈的思想。有时我确实睡着了。但是因弗雷里法庭和囚犯在四处张望找寻着他们失踪的证人，这幅情景紧随着我进入睡梦中，我会再次惊醒，发现自己精神郁闷，身体难受。我觉得安迪好像在观察我，不过我不太理会他。说真的，我食不下咽，度日如年。","I remember I was at bottom a good deal gratified with this result; and the next humour I fell into was one (I had near said) of gratitude to Prestongrange, who had saved me, in this violent, illegal manner, out of the midst of my dangers, temptations, and perplexities.But this was both too flimsy and too cowardly to last me long, and the remembrance of James began to succeed to the possession of my spirits.The 21st, the day set for the trial, I passed in such misery of mind as I can scarce recall to have endured, save perhaps upon Isle Earraid only.Much of the time I lay on a brae-side betwixt sleep and waking, my body motionless, my mind full of violent thoughts.Sometimes I slept indeed; but the court-house of Inverary and the prisoner glancing on all sides to find his missing witness, followed me in slumber; and I would wake again with a start to darkness of spirit and distress of body.I thought Andie seemed to observe me, but I paid him little heed.Verily, my bread was bitter to me, and my days a burthen."
"第二天一大早（星期五，22号）一艘船载着供给品驶来，安迪把一封信交到我的手上。封面上没有地址，但是有政府的封印。信内附有两封便笺。 “鲍尔弗先生现在可以自己看清楚了，要管闲事为时已晚。他的言行仍需观察，他的谨慎会有回报。”第一封便笺就是这么写的，似乎是用左手费力写出来的。从这些话中可以断定还没有什么事危及到那位律师的安全，即使他可能会被发现。可怕的是，那封印代替了签名，单独印在一张没有书写痕迹的纸上。我不得不承认（迄今为止）我的对手知道他们在做什么，我还得尽力忍受诺言之下所隐含的威胁。","Early the next morning (Friday, 22nd) a boat came with provisions, and Andie placed a packet in my hand.The cover was without address but sealed with a Government seal.It enclosed two notes.“Mr. Balfour can now see for himself it is too late to meddle.His conduct will be observed and his discretion rewarded.”So ran the first, which seemed to be laboriously writ with the left hand.There was certainly nothing in these expressions to compromise the writer, even if that person could be found; the seal, which formidably served instead of signature, was affixed to a separate sheet on which there was no scratch of writing; and I had to confess that (so far) my adversaries knew what they were doing, and to digest as well as I was able the threat that peeped under the promise."
"信内附的第二张便笺更令人吃惊。这是一个女人的笔迹。“告知戴维·鲍尔弗先生，有位朋友在打听他的消息，她的眼睛是灰色的。”这信来得——似乎太特别了，这么一封信在这个时刻送达我的手里，还盖着政府的印章，我呆住了。卡特里奥娜的灰眼睛在我的记忆里熠熠生辉。我怀着无限的喜悦想到，她一定就是那位朋友。但是写信的又会是谁，居然可以把她的便笺和普雷斯顿格兰奇的附在一起？而且最奇怪的就是，给呆在巴斯上面的我送来这封令人高兴却完全无关紧要的消息，这有什么必要呢？至于这位写信的人，我能想到的除了格兰特小姐之外再无他人了。我记得她的家人曾经评论过卡特里奥娜的眼睛，甚至还用眼睛的颜色称呼她。而她本人跟我说话时习惯用土气的发音，我还以为是在对我的土气表示嗤之以鼻呢。此外，毫无疑问她正住在这封信发出的房子里。所以就只剩一步需要弄清楚了，那就是普雷斯顿格兰奇怎么会允许她掺和进这么秘密的一桩事情，或者让她这张不甚正经的便条和他自己的信放在同一个信封里。但正是这一点让我顿有所悟。因为，首先，这位年轻的女士有着相当惊人的能力，也许她爸爸颇受其掌控，而我不知道而已。第二，这位检察总长在继续使用我记忆中他一贯用的策略。他的行为时刻夹杂着关心，在那么多争论中，他很少摘掉友谊的面具。他肯定是考虑到囚禁我已经把我给激怒了。也许这小小的玩笑、友好的信息就是为了解除我的敌意？","But the second enclosure was by far the more surprising.It was in a lady’s hand of writ.“Maister Dauvit Balfour is informed a friend was speiring for him and her eyes were of the grey,” it ran—and seemed so extraordinary a piece to come to my hands at such a moment and under cover of a Government seal, that I stood stupid.Catriona’s grey eyes shone in my remembrance.I thought, with a bound of pleasure, she must be the friend.But who should the writer be, to have her billet thus enclosed with Prestongrange’s?And of all wonders, why was it thought needful to give me this pleasing but most inconsequent intelligence upon the Bass?For the writer, I could hit upon none possible except Miss Grant.Her family, I remembered, had remarked on Catriona’s eyes and even named her for their colour; and she herself had been much in the habit to address me with a broad pronunciation, by way of a sniff, I supposed, at my rusticity.No doubt, besides, but she lived in the same house as this letter came from.So there remained but one step to be accounted for; and that was how Prestongrange should have permitted her at all in an affair so secret, or let her daft-like billet go in the same cover with his own.But even here I had a glimmering.For, first of all, there was something rather alarming about the young lady, and papa might be more under her domination than I knew.And, second, there was the man’s continual policy to be remembered, how his conduct had been continually mingled with caresses, and he had scarce ever, in the midst of so much contention, laid aside a mask of friendship.He must conceive that my imprisonment had incensed me.Perhaps this little jesting, friendly message was intended to disarm my rancour?"
"我要诚实地说——我认为它成功了。我突然对那位美丽的格兰特小姐感到一阵温暖，她屈尊对我的事情这么关注。提到卡特里奥娜自然会打动我，让我更加温和、懦弱地想去协商。如果检察总长知道她以及我们之间的交情——如果我能够按照他信中所指出的那种“谨慎”行事来取悦他——他凭什么就不会这么来引导我呢！经上说：“见鸟张网，亦是徒劳。”那么，鸟一定比人更聪明！因为我以为我看穿了他耍的手腕，结果还是陷进了他的圈套。","I will be honest—and I think it did.I felt a sudden warmth towards that beautiful Miss Grant, that she should stoop to so much interest in my affairs.The summoning up of Catriona moved me of itself to milder and more cowardly counsels.If the Advocate knew of her and our acquaintance—if I should please him by some of that “discretion” at which his letter pointed—to what might not this lead!In vain is the net prepared in the sight of any fowl, the Scripture says.Well, fowls must be wiser than folk!For I thought I perceived the policy, and yet fell in with it."
"我沉浸在这样的心境中，我的心怦怦在跳，那双灰色的眼睛就像两颗星星一样清晰地出现在我眼前，这时安迪突然打断了我的遐想。","I was in this frame, my heart beating, the grey eyes plain before me like two stars, when Andie broke in upon my musing."
"“我知道你得到了好消息。”他说。","“I see ye has gotten guid news,” said he."
"我发现他好奇地在看着我的脸，这使我眼前好像显现出詹姆斯·斯图尔特和因弗雷里法庭的景象，我的思绪立刻像铰链上的门一样转动了起来。我想到，审判有时候比预期拖得更久。即使当我赶到因弗雷里时已经太迟了，也许我还是可以努力做一些对詹姆斯有利的事情——按照我自己的性格，最好能完成此愿。似乎没怎么多考虑，我立刻就想出了一个计划。","I found him looking curiously in my face; with that there came before me like a vision of James Stewart and the court of Inverary; and my mind turned at once like a door upon its hinges.Trials, I reflected, sometimes draw out longer than is looked for.Even if I came to Inverary just too late, something might yet be attempted in the interests of James—and in those of my own character, the best would be accomplished.In a moment, it seemed without thought, I had a plan devised."
"“安迪，”我说，“还是定在明天吗？”","“Andie,” said I, “is it still to be to-morrow?”"
"他告诉我什么都没有改变。","He told me nothing was changed."
"“有没有说到具体的时间？”我问。","“Was anything said about the hour?” I asked."
"他告诉我是下午两点钟。","He told me it was to be two o’clock afternoon."
"“那地点在哪里呢？”我追问道。","“And about the place?” I pursued."
"“什么地点？”安迪说。","“Whatten place?” says Andie."
"“我将抵岸的地点？”我说。","“The place I am to be landed at?” said I."
"他承认对此他没得到任何指示。","He owned there was nothing as to that."
"“那么，很好，”我说，“这就由我来安排吧。风是从东边刮来的，我的路在西边，保管好你的船，我要租用。我们整天都会向福斯河上游进发，明天两点钟在最西头让我上岸，那个时候我们应该已经到了。”","“Very well, then,” I said, “this shall be mine to arrange.The wind is in the east, my road lies westward: keep your boat, I hire it; let us work up the Forth all day; and land me at two o’clock to-morrow at the westmost we’ll can have reached.”"
"“你这个蠢家伙！”他叫道，“之后你就会设法去因弗雷里的！”","“Ye daft callant!” he cried; “ye would try for Inverary after a’!”"
"“就是那样，安迪。”我说。","“Just that, Andie,” says I."
"“好吧，真是服了你了！”他说。“昨天的事我感到有点儿抱歉。”他补充道，“要知道，直到那时我都没有完全肯定你到底想走哪一条路。”","“Weel, ye’re ill to beat!” says he.“And I was a kind o’ sorry for ye a’ day yesterday,” he added.“Ye see, I was never entirely sure till then, which way of it ye really wantit.”"
"这就叫做给瘸腿的马踢一马刺！","Here was a spur to a lame horse!"
"“跟你说句悄悄话，安迪，”我说，“我这个计划还有一样好处。我们可以把这几个高地人甩在后面，让他们呆在岩石上。在你那些来自卡斯尔顿的船里，有一条可以明天带他们离开。  那个尼尔看着你的时候眼神很古怪。我一走出这个大门，他们就有可能又动刀子。这些禽兽特别怨恨你。将来万一出现什么问题的话，这就是你的理由。我们的生命受到了野蛮人的威胁，为对我的安全负责，你选择了带我离开他们住的地方，而且余下的时间一直都把我扣留在你的船上。你知道吗，安迪？”我带着一丝微笑说道，“我认为这是非常明智的选择。”","“A word in your ear, Andie,” said I.“This plan of mine has another advantage yet.We can leave these Hielandman behind us on the rock, and one of your boats from the Castleton can bring them off to-morrow.Yon Neil has a queer eye when he regards you; maybe, if I was once out of the gate there might be knives again; these red-shanks are unco grudgeful.And if there should come to be any question, here is your excuse.Our lives were in danger by these savages; being answerable for my safety, you chose the part to bring me from their neighbourhood and detain me the rest of the time on board your boat: and do you know, Andie?” says I, with a smile, “I think it was very wisely chosen,”"
"“事实上我对尼尔没有一点好感，”安迪说，“我想他对我也一样。我极不愿意与这个人打交道。不管怎么说吧，塔姆·安斯特更适合跟这些畜生打交道。”（安斯特这个人来自法夫，那里仍然在说盖尔语）“是呀！”安迪说，“塔姆最善于对付他们。我发誓！我越想这件事，就越觉得没有必要留在这里。 这个地方——唉，见鬼！他们已经忘记这个地方了。哦，肖斯，你这家伙想精明的时候就很精明！还有啊，我就把我的命交给你了。”他更加一本正经地补充道，而且还向我伸出手表示说定了。","“The truth is I have nae goo for Neil,” says Andie, “nor he for me, I’m thinking; and I would like ill to come to my hands wi’ the man.Tam Anster will make a better hand of it with the cattle onyway.”(For this man, Anster, came from Fife, where the Gaelic is still spoken.)“Ay, ay!” says Andie, “Tam’ll can deal with them the best.And troth! the mair I think of it, the less I see we would be required.The place—ay, feggs! they had forgot the place.Eh, Shaws, ye’re a lang-heided chield when ye like!Forby that I’m awing ye my life,” he added, with more solemnity, and offered me his hand upon the bargain."
"于是，没有再多说话，我们突然登上船，解缆，扬起了风帆。那几个格里格拉人当时正在忙着做早餐，因为做饭是他们的份内事。但是，其中有个人登上城垛，发现我们逃跑了，当时我们离开那岩石还不到二十英寻。他们三个简直就像破了巢的蚂蚁一样，在废墟里飞跑，跑到登陆板上，大声喊叫着恳求我们回去。我们两个仍然在巨岩的阴影和遮掩中，一直到进入宽阔的水面，但是很快，几乎是在同一时刻我们就驶入海风中，驶入阳光下了。风帆鼓得满满的，小船微微向后倾斜，我们很快掠过，听不见他们的叫声了。他们在那岩石上得忍受何等的恐怖，他们现在被遗弃在那里，没有任何文明人的面孔，或者说连《圣经》的保护都没有了，那种恐怖会是无限的。也没有给他们留下任何白兰地来安慰他们，因为甚至在匆忙秘密地离开的时候，安迪还设法把酒给搬走了。","Whereupon, with scarce more words, we stepped suddenly on board the boat, cast off, and set the lug.The Gregara were then busy upon breakfast, for the cookery was their usual part; but, one of them stepping to the battlements, our flight was observed before we were twenty fathoms from the rock; and the three of them ran about the ruins and the landing-shelf, for all the world like ants about a broken nest, hailing and crying on us to return.We were still in both the lee and the shadow of the rock, which last lay broad upon the waters, but presently came forth in almost the same moment into the wind and sunshine; the sail filled, the boat heeled to the gunwale, and we swept immediately beyond sound of the men’s voices.To what terrors they endured upon the rock, where they were now deserted without the countenance of any civilised person or so much as the protection of a Bible, no limit can be set; nor had they any brandy left to be their consolation, for even in the haste and secrecy of our departure Andie had managed to remove it."
"我们首先就打算把“安斯特”号靠岸停在格伦泰思岩石群附近一处小海湾中，这样那几个被我们困在巨岩上的人就要到第二天才有可能让人发现了。自此我们远离了福斯海湾。当时比较强劲的微风很快就减弱下来，但是我们的航行从没有真正受阻过。我们整天都不停地在前行，可是常常走不了多少路，所以直到黄昏以后我们才到达昆斯费里。为了遵守和安迪的约定（或者说约定中还剩下的部分）我必须得留在船上，可是我想，写信跟岸上联系联系应该无妨。我就用了普雷斯顿格兰奇的信封，上面还有政府的封印，这一定会让我的收信人大吃一惊的。借着船上的提灯，我写了一些必要的话，就登上甲板，让安迪把信捎给兰基勒。大约一个小时以后他回来了，带来一个装着钱的钱包，还有就是向我保证明天两点会在克拉克曼南湖边为我准备一匹配了鞍的好马。 这件事办完之后，船就抛下石锚停泊在旁，我们则躺在船帆下睡了。","It was our first care to set Anster ashore in a cove by the Glenteithy Rocks, so that the deliverance of our maroons might be duly seen to the next day.Thence we kept away up Firth.The breeze, which was then so spirited, swiftly declined, but never wholly failed us.All day we kept moving, though often not much more; and it was after dark ere we were up with the Queensferry.To keep the letter of Andie’s engagement (or what was left of it) I must remain on board, but I thought no harm to communicate with the shore in writing.On Prestongrange’s cover, where the Government seal must have a good deal surprised my correspondent, I writ, by the boat’s lantern, a few necessary words, aboard and Andie carried them to Rankeillor.In about an hour he came again, with a purse of money and the assurance that a good horse should be standing saddled for me by two to-morrow at Clackmannan Pool.This done, and the boat riding by her stone anchor, we lay down to sleep under the sail."
"第二天离两点钟还早得很，我们就到了湖边。那里还没有给我留下任何东西，我只好坐着等。我有点儿兴致勃勃地在做自己这桩差事了。要是能有任何可用的借口放下这件事，我本该很高兴的，但是却没有找到，我的不安丝毫不亚于我为达成愿望而感到的快乐。一点钟刚过不久，就有一匹马出现在湖岸边，我看到有个人牵着它来回踱步，等着我上岸，这大大加剧了我急躁的情绪。安迪这时跑过来很爽快地放了我，表明他自己是个信守承诺的人，是不会用尽办法去为难他的雇主的。大概两点刚过五十秒我就骑着马全速往斯特灵赶去。一个小时多一点，我就已经驰过那个小镇，来到了艾伦上船的海岸边，当时天气突变，袭来一场小暴雨。雨水蒙蔽了我的眼睛，风几乎把我从马鞍上掀下来，这荒野中的第一个黑夜几乎把我给困住了。我当时还在巴尔惠德东边的某个地方，不很清楚自己的方位，骑着的那匹马也已经疲惫不堪。","We were in the Pool the next day long ere two; and there was nothing left for me but to sit and wait.I felt little alacrity upon my errand.I would have been glad of any passable excuse to lay it down; but none being to be found, my uneasiness was no less great than if I had been running to some desired pleasure.By shortly after one the horse was at the waterside, and I could see a man walking it to and fro till I should land, which vastly swelled my impatience.Andie ran the moment of my liberation very fine, showing himself a man of his bare word, but scarce serving his employers with a heaped measure; and by about fifty seconds after two I was in the saddle and on the full stretch for Stirling.In a little more than an hour I had passed that town, and was already mounting Alan Water side, when the weather broke in a small tempest.The rain blinded me, the wind had nearly beat me from the saddle, and the first darkness of the night surprised me in a wilderness still some way east of Balwhidder, not very sure of my direction and mounted on a horse that began already to be weary."
"由于事态紧急的压力，也没有时间可以耽搁，再加上对向导的厌烦，我就沿着（只要骑马的人能走）曾和艾伦同行的那条路线前行。这样我都还得睁大双眼，提防路途中的巨大危险，这一切都是暴风雨带来的严酷现实。最后我终于弄清楚自己身在何处了，我觉得一定是在乌安沃的附近，时间也许是晚上六点钟。我仍然认为自己运气极好，因为我大约十一点赶到了目的地——邓肯·杜的家。在我间或迷路的地方，也许马会告诉我方向。我记得我们摔倒过两次，一次是我从马鞍上摔下来，那一刻只感觉到全身一阵火辣辣的痛。马和人都浑身是泥，甚至连眼睛上都有泥巴。","In the press of my hurry, and to be spared the delay and annoyance of a guide, I had followed (so far as it was possible for any horseman) the line of my journey with Alan.This I did with open eyes, foreseeing a great risk in it, which the tempest had now brought to a reality.The last that I knew of where I was, I think it must have been about Uam Var; the hour perhaps six at night.I must still think it great good fortune that I got about eleven to my destination, the house of Duncan Dhu.Where I had wandered in the interval perhaps the horse could tell.I know we were twice down, and once over the saddle and for a moment carried away in a roaring burn.Steed and rider were bemired up to the eyes."
"从邓肯那里我得到了审判的消息。审判遵循了所有高原地区的宗教利益，消息以人们能传播的最快速度从因弗雷里迅速传开。我非常高兴地得知，一直到星期六很晚的时候，审判还没有得出结论，所有的人都开始推测审判肯定会延续到星期一。在此消息的鼓舞下，我无法坐下来安心吃饭。不过邓肯答应当我的向导，我们再一次徒步上路，我手中捏着一块干粮，一边走一边用力地嚼着。邓肯随身带了一瓶威士忌酒和一盏提灯。只要我们能找到房子重新点燃它，这盏提灯还是可以为我们照明的，因为提灯漏油漏得很厉害，而且每次大风都会把它吹熄。夜晚更多的时候我们都是在滂沱大雨中盲目地行走，天亮才发现自己漫无目的地在深山里转。我们历尽艰难，在篝火旁找到一个小屋，在那里我们吃了一点东西，知道了方向。就在讲道要结束之前，我们赶到了因弗雷里的苏格兰教堂的门口。","From Duncan I had news of the trial.It was followed in all these Highland regions with religious interest; news of it spread from Inverary as swift as men could travel; and I was rejoiced to learn that, up to a late hour that Saturday it was not yet concluded; and all men began to suppose it must spread over the Monday.Under the spur of this intelligence I would not sit to eat; but, Duncan having agreed to be my guide, took the road again on foot, with the piece in my hand and munching as I went.Duncan brought with him a flask of usquebaugh and a hand-lantern; which last enlightened us just so long as we could find houses where to rekindle it, for the thing leaked outrageously and blew out with every gust.The more part of the night we walked blindfold among sheets of rain, and day found us aimless on the mountains.Hard by we struck a hut on a burn-side, where we got bite and a direction; and, a little before the end of the sermon, came to the kirk doors of Inverary."
"大雨把我上身几乎淋透，可是泥水也已经淹至我的膝盖，我浑身上下都水淋淋的。我疲倦至极，一瘸一拐勉强在行走，而我的脸色像鬼一样。我站在那里，和基督教的所有好处相比，我更需要换身衣服，有张床躺一躺。不顾所有这一切（主要的一点就是相信我自己得立刻出现在公众的面前），我打开了教堂的大门，身后跟着脏兮兮的邓肯，我们找了一个空地方坐了下来。","The rain had somewhat washed the upper parts of me, but I was still bogged as high as to the knees; I streamed water; I was so weary I could hardly limp, and my face was like a ghost’s.I stood certainly more in need of a change of raiment and a bed to lie on, than of all the benefits in Christianity.For all which (being persuaded the chief point for me was to make myself immediately public) I set the door of the church with the dirty Duncan at my tails, and finding a vacant place sat down."
"“第十三条，我的教友们，括号内是说：法律自身必须被视为仁慈的手段。”牧师正在说着，带着乐于进一步论理的那种声调。","“Thirteently, my brethren, and in parenthesis, the law itself must be regarded as a means of grace,” the minister was saying, in the voice of one delighting to pursue an argument."
"应立法的要求，讲道说的是英语。法官们和他们的武装随从都在场，门旁一个角落里有些戟在闪闪发光，坐席上群集坐着一排排的律师，这与以往的惯例不同。所讲的是《罗马书》第五章到第十三章——牧师对此非常熟练，所讲的全部内容都非常富含教义——上从阿盖尔公爵以及埃尔希勋爵和基尔克兰勋爵，下到执勤站岗的执戟士兵们——都眉头紧皱非常专注地沉浸其中。 那一刻牧师本人和一个在门口洒水的人看到我们进去了，但立刻就把我们给忘记了。其余的人要么就没有听见，要么就不注意听也不愿意被听到。我不为人察觉地在我的朋友和敌人们中间坐下了。","The sermon was in English on account of the assize.The judges were present with their armed attendants, the halberts glittered in a corner by the door, and the seats were thronged beyond custom with the array of lawyers.The text was in Romans 5th and 13th—the minister a skilled hand; and the whole of that able churchful—from Argyle, and my Lords Elchies and Kilkerran, down to the halbertmen that came in their attendance—was sunk with gathered brows in a profound critical attention.The minister himself and a sprinkling of those about the door observed our entrance at the moment and immediately forgot the same; the rest either did not hear or would not hear or would not be heard; and I sat amongst my friends and enemies unremarked."
"我首先认出的就是普雷斯顿格兰奇。他朝前端坐，就像马鞍上热切的骑手，他饶有兴趣地抿着嘴，他的双眼直盯着牧师，牧师所讲的教义显然甚合他意。在另一边，查尔斯·斯图尔特处于半睡状态，看起来很是疲倦，而且脸色苍白。至于说西蒙·弗雷泽，在这群专心听道的会众中，他就像是一个污点，简直就是在出丑。他的双手揣在口袋里，双腿在摇晃，他清了清嗓子，秃眉上扬，眼睛在不停地左顾右盼。他一会儿打个哈欠，一会儿又窃笑一番。有时候他也会拿起面前的《圣经》，匆匆浏览，好像读了一点点。他又匆匆浏览一遍，之后就会停下来打个大大的哈欠，所有这一切仿佛都是在操练。","The first that I singled out was Prestongrange.He sat well forward, like an eager horseman in the saddle, his lips moving with relish, his eyes glued on the minister; the doctrine was clearly to his mind.Charles Stewart, on the other hand, was half asleep, and looked harassed and pale.As for Simon Fraser, he appeared like a blot, and almost a scandal, in the midst of that attentive congregation, digging his hands in his pockets, shifting his legs, clearing his throat, and rolling up his bald eyebrows and shooting out his eyes to right and left, now with a yawn, now with a secret smile.At times, too, he would take the Bible in front of him, run it through, seem to read a bit, run it through again, and stop and yawn prodigiously: the whole as if for exercise."
"在他坐立不安的时候，他的目光落在了我的身上。他坐在那里愣了一下，随即从《圣经》上撕下半页纸，用铅笔在上面草草写了几个字，对邻座耳语且传给了他。纸条传给了普雷斯顿格兰奇，他只是看了我一眼。然后纸条传到了厄斯金先生手里，又再传给了阿盖尔公爵，他就坐在另外两位与会的大人中间。这位大人转过身来用傲慢的眼神盯着我看。那些人中最后一个对我到场感兴趣的是查利·斯图尔特，而他也开始用铅笔写了点东西，并在附近开始传递，我无法查出这些纸条在人群中最终会传到谁的手里。","In the course of this restlessness his eye alighted on myself.He sat a second stupefied, then tore a half-leaf out of the Bible, scrawled upon it with a pencil, and passed it with a whispered word to his next neighbour.The note came to Prestongrange, who gave me but the one look; thence it voyaged to the hands of Mr. Erskine; thence again to Argyle, where he sat between the other two lords of session, and his Grace turned and fixed me with an arrogant eye.The last of those interested in my presence was Charlie Stewart, and he too began to pencil and hand about dispatches, none of which I was able to trace to their destination in the crowd."
"但是这些纸条的传递已经引起了注意。所有人都在私下里（或者以为自己是在私下里）悄声议论着——其他的人则在询问。那位牧师本人似乎受到了教堂里这种嘈杂、突然的躁动以及窃窃私语声的影响，感到甚是惶恐不安。他的声音变了，很明显有点儿支支吾吾，而他再也无法恢复先前演讲时的那种从容自信和洪亮的声调。他到死恐怕都解不开这个谜，为什么前四个部分的讲道进行得那么成功，到第五部分却如此失败。","But the passage of these notes had aroused notice; all who were in the secret (or supposed themselves to be so) were whispering information—the rest questions; and the minister himself seemed quite discountenanced by the flutter in the church and sudden stir and whispering.His voice changed, he plainly faltered, nor did he again recover the easy conviction and full tones of his delivery.It would be a puzzle to him till his dying day, why a sermon that had gone with triumph through four parts, should this miscarry in the fifth."
"至于我，则继续坐在那里，浑身湿淋淋的而且非常疲惫，满心在担忧着下一步会发生什么事，但是对自己的成功还是感到欢欣鼓舞。","As for me, I continued to sit there, very wet and weary, and a good deal anxious as to what should happen next, but greatly exulting in my success."
"第十七章 请愿书","CHAPTER XVII—THE MEMORIAL"
"牧师的嘴里刚说完最后一句祈祷，斯图尔特律师就抓住了我的手臂。我们第一批出了教堂，他的动作特别麻利，我们很快安全地进了一间四壁严实的房子，那时街上才开始挤满回家的会众。","The last word of the blessing was scarce out of the minister’s mouth before Stewart had me by the arm.We were the first to be forth of the church, and he made such extraordinary expedition that we were safe within the four walls of a house before the street had begun to be thronged with the home-going congregation."
"“我还来得及吗？”我问。","“Am I yet in time?” I asked."
"“是，也不是。”他说，“案子已经结束，陪审团已经退庭了，他们还算好心，明天早晨就会让我们知道他们的意见。三天前，就在这场戏开始之前，我自己可能已经说过同样的话了。这件事从一开始就给公众摆明了。陪审员都知道这一点，‘你会尽你所能帮助我，’他两天前低声跟我说过，‘你从阿盖尔公爵刚才对麦金托什先生说的话就可以知道我的命运了。’哦，那就是一桩丑闻！","“Ay and no,” said he.“The case is over; the jury is enclosed, and will so kind as let us ken their view of it to-morrow in the morning, the same as I could have told it my own self three days ago before the play began.The thing has been public from the start.The panel kent it, ‘Ye may do what ye will for me,’ whispers he two days ago.‘Ye ken my fate by what the Duke of Argyle has just said to Mr. Macintosh.’  O, it’s been a scandal!"
"‘伟大的阿盖尔在出门前，让枪炮齐鸣为他开道。’执权杖的人在高喊‘酷拉呛！’但是既然我再次得到你了，我就永远都不会绝望。橡树一定会盖过桃金娘，我们要在他们自己的城镇里和这些坎贝尔人好好辩一辩。赞美主，我会看到这一天的！”","“The great Agyle he gaed before,He gart the cannons and guns to roar,” and the very macer cried ‘Cruachan!’  But now that I have got you again I’ll never despair.The oak shall go over the myrtle yet; we’ll ding the Campbells yet in their own town.Praise God that I should see the day!”"
"他兴奋得蹦了起来，把他的行李全都倒在地板上，好让我换一套衣服。我在换的时候他还来帮忙，反倒让我觉得碍手碍脚的。还有什么事需要做，或者我该如何去做，这些他从来没有告诉过我，我相信，他也没有想那么多。“我们还是要和坎贝尔家的人好好辩一辩！”他还是那种想法。这不禁令我深思，怎么会这样？表面看来是一套严肃的法律程序，可其核心本质不外乎野蛮部落之间的家族斗争。我相信我的这位大律师朋友绝对不是野蛮人。那些人只看见他坐在辩护律师的身后，面对最高法院的法官，或者只看见他在玩高尔夫球，还在布朗茨菲尔德高尔夫球场建立了自己的俱乐部，他们怎么可能认出这个口若悬河、热衷暴力的族人就是那同一个人呢？","He was leaping with excitement, emptied out his mails upon the floor that I might have a change of clothes, and incommoded me with his assistance as I changed.What remained to be done, or how I was to do it, was what he never told me nor, I believe, so much as thought of.“We’ll ding the Campbells yet!” that was still his overcome.And it was forced home upon my mind how this, that had the externals of a sober process of law, was in its essence a clan battle between savage clans.I thought my friend the Writer none of the least savage.Who that had only seen him at a counsel’s back before the Lord Ordinary or following a golf ball and laying down his clubs on Bruntsfield links, could have recognised for the same person this voluble and violent clansman?"
"詹姆斯·斯图尔特的辩护律师总共有四个人——科尔斯顿的谢里夫·布朗、谢里夫·米勒、罗伯特·麦金托什先生和斯图尔特·霍尔这位小斯图尔特先生。这几个人约好了听完布道后和大律师共进晚餐，我也被欢迎参加这次聚会。外衣刚刚挂好，而且谢里夫·米勒才熟练地调好第一碗酒，我们就直奔眼前的主题了。我简短叙述了自己被捕和被扣押的情况，随后他们就反复盘问我有关凶杀案的种种细节。要记住这可是我第一次在律师们面前说出我想说的话或者我完全掌握的情况。但是结果却让其他人很沮丧，（我必须承认）也让我自己很失望。","James Stewart’s counsel were four in number—Sheriffs Brown of Colstoun and Miller, Mr. Robert Macintosh, and Mr. Stewart younger of Stewart Hall.These were covenanted to dine with the Writer after sermon, and I was very obligingly included of the party.No sooner the cloth lifted, and the first bowl very artfully compounded by Sheriff Miller, than we fell to the subject in hand.I made a short narration of my seizure and captivity, and was then examined and re-examined upon the circumstances of the murder.It will be remembered this was the first time I had had my say out, or the matter at all handled, among lawyers; and the consequence was very dispiriting to the others and (I must own) disappointing to myself."
"“总之，”科尔斯顿说，“你证明艾伦当时在现场，你还听见他用言语威胁了格伦努尔。尽管你向我们保证他不是那个开枪的人，但是你给人留下的强烈印象就是他和凶手是同伙，他同意，也许还直接协助了这件事情。此外你还显示他冒着自己失去自由的风险，积极地在帮助罪犯逃跑。而你的其余证据（哪怕是最小的物证材料）却都依赖于那两个被告——艾伦或者詹姆斯的凭空说词。总之，你根本就不是翻案，只不过是找个大人物延长了把我们的委托人定为凶手这个环节的时间而已。我几乎不必再提，采用第三个共犯的证言更加显出他的出现就是个阴谋，从一开始就是我们辩方的绊脚石。”","“To sum up,” said Colstoun, “you prove that Alan was on the spot; you have heard him proffer menaces against Glenure; and though you assure us he was not the man who fired, you leave a strong impression that he was in league with him, and consenting, perhaps immediately assisting, in the act.You show him besides, at the risk of his own liberty, actively furthering the criminal’s escape.And the rest of your testimony (so far as the least material) depends on the bare word of Alan or of James, the two accused.In short, you do not at all break, but only lengthen by one personage, the chain that binds our client to the murderer; and I need scarcely say that the introduction of a third accomplice rather aggravates that appearance of a conspiracy which has been our stumbling block from the beginning.”"
"“我也持相同的意见，”谢里夫·米勒说，“我认为我们可能都要万分感谢普雷斯顿格兰奇把我们一个最不合意的证人给带走了。主要是，我认为，鲍尔弗先生自己也许会感恩不尽的。因为你说到了第三个共犯，但是鲍尔弗先生（在我看来）就已经很像是第四个共犯了。”","“I am of the same opinion,” said Sheriff Miller.“I think we may all be very much obliged to Prestongrange for taking a most uncomfortable witness out of our way.And chiefly, I think, Mr. Balfour himself might be obliged.For you talk of a third accomplice, but Mr. Balfour (in my view) has very much the appearance of a fourth.”"
"“请允许我说一句，先生们！”斯图尔特大律师插进来说，“还有另一种观点。现在我们有一个目击证人——不要为是否有物证材料而烦恼——是此诉讼案中的一个证人，遭到了格伦努尔·麦格雷戈原来那伙无视法纪的强盗的绑架，在巴斯那座破旧的岩石废墟里被扣押了将近一个月。翻开看看在这个过程中藏着怎样肮脏的勾当啊！ 先生们，这个故事会为整个世界敲响警钟！要是我们对此紧抓不放，还不能给我的委托人讨回公道，那就太奇怪了。”","“Allow me, sirs!” interposed Stewart the Writer.“There is another view.Here we have a witness—never fash whether material or not—a witness in this cause, kidnapped by that old, lawless, bandit crew of the Glengyle Macgregors, and sequestered for near upon a month in a bourock of old ruins on the Bass.Move that and see what dirt you fling on the proceedings!Sirs, this is a tale to make the world ring with!It would be strange, with such a grip as this, if we couldnae squeeze out a pardon for my client.”"
"“假设我们明天开始启动鲍尔弗先生的案子怎么样？”斯图尔特·霍尔说，“除非是我大受欺骗，否则我们将会发现在我们的道路上障碍重重，结果在我们找到一家法院肯倾听我们之前，詹姆斯就已经被绞死了。这是一桩大丑闻，但是我想我们任何一个人都不会忘记还有一桩更大的丑闻，我是指格兰奇夫人一事。 那个女人仍然被监禁着，我的朋友兰基勒的霍普先生已经竭尽人事，而他的进展速度又如何呢？他还从未得到过授权呢！好吧，现在会是相同的一幕，使用的手段也会相同。先生，这只是家族仇恨的一个场景。这种仇恨，我曾有幸领教过，会化为怒火恣意肆虐。在这里什么都看不到，能看到的只有坎贝尔赤裸裸的敌意和坎贝尔卑鄙的阴谋诡计。”","“And suppose we took up Mr. Balfour’s cause to-morrow?” said Stewart Hall.“I am much deceived or we should find so many impediments thrown in our path, as that James should have been hanged before we had found a court to hear us.This is a great scandal, but I suppose we have none of us forgot a greater still, I mean the matter of the Lady Grange.The woman was still in durance; my friend Mr. Hope of Rankeillor did what was humanly possible; and how did he speed?He never got a warrant!Well, it’ll be the same now; the same weapons will be used.This is a scene, gentleman, of clan animosity.The hatred of the name which I have the honour to bear, rages in high quarters.There is nothing here to be viewed but naked Campbell spite and scurvy Campbell intrigue.”"
"你可以肯定，这触及了一个受他们欢迎的话题，不过我在这些博学的辩护律师中坐了一段时间，除了极少数略有智慧的主张外，我几乎就没听他们的谈话。那位大律师不由地发表了一些慷慨激昂的言论，科尔斯顿必然会赞同他的观点，而且认定他是正确的。其余两个人各自加入不同的见解方，但都在大声喧哗，争论不休。在争论中，阿盖尔公爵就像条毯子被他们拍击，提到乔治国王时他们也会顺便挖苦一番，这份辩护词准备得未免过于详尽了吧。只有一个人似乎被他们给忘记了，那就是格伦斯的詹姆斯。","You may be sure this was to touch a welcome topic, and I sat for some time in the midst of my learned counsel, almost deaved with their talk but extremely little the wiser for its purport.The Writer was led into some hot expressions; Colstoun must take him up and set him right; the rest joined in on different sides, but all pretty noisy; the Duke of Argyle was beaten like a blanket; King George came in for a few digs in the by-going and a great deal of rather elaborate defence; and there was only one person that seemed to be forgotten, and that was James of the Glens."
"在整场争论中米勒先生一直静静地坐着。他是一位清瘦的老绅士，脸色红润，眼睛闪亮。他说话流畅，声音浑厚，给人一种机敏无限的印象，每一句谈吐都像演员那样，尽力彰显其最丰富的表现力。甚至就是现在，当他沉默不语地坐在那里的时候，他的假发被搁置一旁，双手握着酒杯，嘴唇滑稽地抿着，下巴朝前伸着，似乎一副愉快而狡黠的模样。显然他是有话要说，只是在等待合适的时机。","Through all this Mr. Miller sat quiet.He was a slip of an oldish gentleman, ruddy and twinkling; he spoke in a smooth rich voice, with an infinite effect of pawkiness, dealing out each word the way an actor does, to give the most expression possible; and even now, when he was silent, and sat there with his wig laid aside, his glass in both hands, his mouth funnily pursed, and his chin out, he seemed the mere picture of a merry slyness.It was plain he had a word to say, and waited for the fit occasion."
"不久机会就来了。科尔斯顿的那一通发言结束了，发言里提到了他们要对其委托人负责任。我想，他的兄弟谢里夫对这种话锋的转变感到很高兴。他摆出一副自信的姿势和神情接过了话题。","It came presently.Colstoun had wound up one of his speeches with some expression of their duty to their client.His brother sheriff was pleased, I suppose, with the transition.He took the table in his confidence with a gesture and a look."
"“你那番话提醒我要考虑一下有些事情似乎给忽略了。”他说，“我们委托人的利益当然是高于一切的，但是世界不会因为詹姆斯·斯图尔特之死而终结。”说到这里，他抬起了眼睛。“我这番话也可以用在，比如说，乔治·布朗先生、托马斯·米勒和戴维·鲍尔弗先生的身上。戴维·鲍尔弗先生有非常充分的理由去上诉，但我认为，先生们——如果他的经历能以适当的方式予以公开——我想那就会引起很多激烈的争论。”","“That suggests to me a consideration which seems overlooked,” said he.“The interest of our client goes certainly before all, but the world does not come to an end with James Stewart.”Whereat he cocked his eye.“I might condescend, exempli gratia, upon a Mr. George Brown, a Mr. Thomas Miller, and a Mr. David Balfour.Mr. David Balfour has a very good ground of complaint, and I think, gentlemen—if his story was properly redd out—I think there would be a number of wigs on the green.”"
"全桌的人都转向了他，连动作姿态都一样。","The whole table turned to him with a common movement."
"“进行适当的处理并小心谨慎地予以公开，他的经历几乎不可能不造成一些影响。”他继续说道，“整个司法管理部门，从最高长官往下，名誉都会彻底扫地。而在我看来，好像他们都有必要被取而代之了。”他这么说的时候眼睛里似乎闪着狡诈的光亮。“我没必要向你们指出：鲍尔弗先生的这桩案子一旦出庭就会是一场引人注目的好戏了。”他补充道。","“Properly handled and carefully redd out, his is a story that could scarcely fail to have some consequence,” he continued.“The whole administration of justice, from its highest officer downward, would be totally discredited; and it looks to me as if they would need to be replaced.”He seemed to shine with cunning as he said it.“And I need not point out to ye that this of Mr. Balfour’s would be a remarkable bonny cause to appear in,” he added."
"于是，他们全部都开始转向另一个话题：鲍尔弗先生的案子可以用什么样的言辞来陈述，有哪些官员会因此而倒台，什么人又会接任他们的职位。我只需列举两个例子。他们提议去和西蒙·弗雷泽接触，如果能够得到他的证词的话，对阿盖尔和普雷斯顿格兰奇肯定会是致命一击。米勒高度赞成这种尝试。“在我们面前现在摆着滴油的烤肉，”他说，“大家都尽情地吃吧。”我觉得他们全都垂涎欲滴了。这一个话题也已经接近尾声。 斯图尔特大律师欣喜若狂，他嗅到了向他主要的敌人公爵复仇的气息。","Well, there they all were started on another hare; Mr. Balfour’s cause, and what kind of speeches could be there delivered, and what officials could be thus turned out, and who would succeed to their positions.I shall give but the two specimens.It was proposed to approach Simon Fraser, whose testimony, if it could be obtained, would prove certainly fatal to Argyle and to Prestongrange.Miller highly approved of the attempt.“We have here before us a dreeping roast,” said he, “here is cut-and-come-again for all.”And methought all licked their lips.The other was already near the end.Stewart the Writer was out of the body with delight, smelling vengeance on his chief enemy, the Duke."
"“先生们，”他喊道，并倒满他的酒杯，“这杯酒是敬谢里夫·米勒的。他在法律上的才能是众所周知的。他的烹饪术嘛，摆在我们面前的这碗佳肴可以来证明。但是说到政治！”他叫道，并把酒一饮而尽。","“Gentlemen,” cried he, charging his glass, “here is to Sheriff Miller.His legal abilities are known to all.His culinary, this bowl in front of us is here to speak for.But when it comes to the poleetical!”—cries he, and drains the glass."
"“是啊，可是按你的意思就很难显示出政治手腕了，我的朋友。”洋洋自得的米勒说，“一场革命，只要你愿意，我想我可以向你保证历史学家一定会把鲍尔弗先生的案件记入史册。但是适当地予以引导，斯图尔特先生，委婉地予以引导，结果就会是一场和平的革命。”","“Ay, but it will hardly prove politics in your meaning, my friend,” said the gratified Miller.“A revolution, if you like, and I think I can promise you that historical writers shall date from Mr. Balfour’s cause.But properly guided, Mr. Stewart, tenderly guided, it shall prove a peaceful revolution.”"
"“如果那些该死的坎贝尔人气得抓耳挠腮，那我可管不着了！”斯图尔特一边猛捶着拳头一边叫道。","“And if the damned Campbells get their ears rubbed, what care I?” cries Stewart, smiting down his fist."
"尽管看着这些老权谋家那副貌似天真的样子我忍不住笑了起来，但是可以认为我对这一切并不是很满意。我可不想为谢里夫·米勒的发迹晋升去忍受这么多悲伤痛苦，或者到议会大厦里去制造一场革命。于是我就用自己认为最简洁明了的方式提出了异议。","It will be thought I was not very well pleased with all this, though I could scarce forbear smiling at a kind of innocency in these old intriguers.But it was not my view to have undergone so many sorrows for the advancement of Sheriff Miller or to make a revolution in the Parliament House: and I interposed accordingly with as much simplicity of manner as I could assume."
"“我得谢谢你们，先生们，谢谢你们的忠告。”我说，“现在，请勿见怪，我想问你们两三个问题。有一件事情已经搁置一边没人理睬了，比如说：这件事会有利于我们的朋友，格伦斯的詹姆斯吗？”","“I have to thank you, gentlemen, for your advice,” said I.“And now I would like, by your leave, to set you two or three questions.There is one thing that has fallen rather on one aide, for instance: Will this cause do any good to our friend James of the Glens?”"
"他们似乎都往后甩了甩头发，给出了各种不同的答案，但实际上有一点看法完全相同，那就是除非国王大发慈悲，詹姆斯现在没有任何希望了。","They seemed all a hair set back, and gave various answers, but concurring practically in one point, that James had now no hope but in the King’s mercy."
"“那么，再接下去，”我说，“这件事会有利于苏格兰吗？我们有句俗话就是：家丑不可外扬。我记得听人说在我还很小的时候我们爱丁堡曾发动过一场暴乱，引得已故女王称这个国家为野蛮之邦，我总认为我们为此所失超过了所得。接着就是1745年，让苏格兰成为了全国各地的谈资，但我从来没有听说过我们从中得到了什么好处。现在到你们所称的鲍尔弗先生事件了。谢里夫·米勒告诉我们历史学家一定会把这件事记入史册，对此我不以为奇。我只是担心他们会把它记载为一个灾难时期，一个备受公众谴责的时期。”","“To proceed, then,” said I, “will it do any good to Scotland?We have a saying that it is an ill bird that fouls his own nest.I remember hearing we had a riot in Edinburgh when I was an infant child, which gave occasion to the late Queen to call this country barbarous; and I always understood that we had rather lost than gained by that.Then came the year ‘Forty-five, which made Scotland to be talked of everywhere; but I never heard it said we had anyway gained by the ‘Forty-five.And now we come to this cause of Mr. Balfour’s, as you call it.Sheriff Miller tells us historical writers are to date from it, and I would not wonder.It is only my fear they would date from it as a period of calamity and public reproach.”"
"机智敏捷的米勒已经嗅出我的意图所在，于是赶紧转向同一条道路上来。“表达有力，鲍尔弗先生，”他说，“评述很有分量，先生。”","The nimble-witted Miller had already smelt where I was travelling to, and made haste to get on the same road.“Forcibly put, Mr. Balfour,” says he.“A weighty observe, sir.”"
"“接下来我们要问问自己，这样做是否于乔治国王有益。”我继续说道，“看样子谢里夫·米勒认为这个问题相当简单。不过要不是因为国王陛下来过一两次，而且其中一次显然是致命的，我怀疑你们几乎不可能让他控制下的议会垮台。”","“We have next to ask ourselves if it will be good for King George,” I pursued.“Sheriff Miller appears pretty easy upon this; but I doubt you will scarce be able to pull down the house from under him, without his Majesty coming by a knock or two, one of which might easily prove fatal.”"
"我给他们一个机会来回答，但是没人愿意作答。","I have them a chance to answer, but none volunteered."
"“至于那些会在这件事中得益的人，”我继续说道，“谢里夫·米勒给我们提到了几个人的名字，其中他好心地提到了我。如果我和他想法不同，还希望他能原谅我。我相信还没等事情发展到最后一步，我自己就会被绞死了，却还是救不出什么人的性命。不过我承认我认为自己处境非常危险，我也承认我认为对于一个年轻人来说，怀着想做律师的理想，却在还不到二十岁的时候就被渲染成一个狂暴、惹事生非的家伙，这真的很遗憾。至于詹姆斯，看来——事情到了这一天，判决一旦宣读——他根本没有希望了，除非国王大发慈悲。难道那个时侯国王陛下就不会听进更多的谗言，难道这些高官的声誉就不会在公众面前得以维护，难道我自己就无法脱离这种我认为会毁灭自己的处境？”","“Of those for whom the case was to be profitable,” I went on, “Sheriff Miller gave us the names of several, among the which he was good enough to mention mine.I hope he will pardon me if I think otherwise.I believe I hung not the least back in this affair while there was life to be saved; but I own I thought myself extremely hazarded, and I own I think it would be a pity for a young man, with some idea of coming to the Bar, to ingrain upon himself the character of a turbulent, factious fellow before he was yet twenty.As for James, it seems—at this date of the proceedings, with the sentence as good as pronounced—he has no hope but in the King’s mercy.May not his Majesty, then, be more pointedly addressed, the characters of these high officers sheltered from the public, and myself kept out of a position which I think spells ruin for me?”"
"他们全都坐在那里盯着自己的杯子，我看得出他们发现我对此事的态度很不对他们的口味。但是米勒对各种情况都已经有所准备。","They all sat and gazed into their glasses, and I could see they found my attitude on the affair unpalatable.But Miller was ready at all events."
"“是否能允许我用更为正式的形式来表述我这位年轻朋友的观点，”他说，“我明白他的提议，即我们应该把他被扣押的事实，也许还有一些他打算在证言中提到的重要人物，都写进给国王的请愿书里。这个计划有成功的因素。这很可能和其他计划一样（也许更可能）可以帮助我们的委托人。兴许国王陛下很仁慈地感受到了这份请愿书所表达的感谢之意，这也有可能被理解为一种非常忠诚的表达。我觉得，在起草这份文件时，可以提出这种观点。”","“If I may be allowed to put my young friend’s notion in more formal shape,” says he, “I understand him to propose that we should embody the fact of his sequestration, and perhaps some heads of the testimony he was prepared to offer, in a memorial to the Crown.This plan has elements of success.It is as likely as any other (and perhaps likelier) to help our client.Perhaps his Majesty would have the goodness to feel a certain gratitude to all concerned in such a memorial, which might be construed into an expression of a very delicate loyalty; and I think, in the drafting of the same, this view might be brought forward.”"
"他们所有的人都互相点了点头，莫不发出叹息声，因为先前的选择无疑更加符合他们的意愿。","They all nodded to each other, not without sighs, for the former alternative was doubtless more after their inclination."
"“那么，请拿纸来，斯图尔特先生，”米勒继续说，“我想，作为被告的诉讼代理人，我们在座的五个人也许很适合签署这份文件。”","“Paper, then, Mr. Stewart, if you please,” pursued Miller; “and I think it might very fittingly be signed by the five of us here present, as procurators for the condemned man.”‘"
"“至少这件事不会对我们有害，”科尔斯顿说，又叹息了一声，因为就在最近十分钟前他本人才见过那位检察总长。","“It can do none of us any harm, at least,” says Colstoun, heaving another sigh, for he had seen himself Lord Advocate the last ten minutes."
"于是他们不是很热心地开始着手起草请愿书——这个很快就会让他们因此而引火烧身的步骤。我没有更多的事情要做，只好坐着旁观，偶尔回答一个问题。文件表述得很好。开头陈述我本人的基本情况，我的担忧所带来的后果，我的屈服和我所承受的压力，我被扣押的事，还有我赶到因弗雷里却为时已晚，接着解释了我对国王忠诚的种种理由以及我愿意为了民众的利益而放弃任何行动的权利，最后结束时则代表詹姆斯强烈地恳求国王的宽恕。","Thereupon they set themselves, not very enthusiastically, to draft the memorial—a process in the course of which they soon caught fire; and I had no more ado but to sit looking on and answer an occasional question.The paper was very well expressed; beginning with a recitation of the facts about myself, the reward offered for my apprehension, my surrender, the pressure brought to bear upon me; my sequestration; and my arrival at Inverary in time to be too late; going on to explain the reasons of loyalty and public interest for which it was agreed to waive any right of action; and winding up with a forcible appeal to the King’s mercy on behalf of James."
"我觉得我在很大程度上成为了牺牲品，甚至就是在一个人的火炬光亮的映照下，而我这群律师曾费劲困难想阻止这个人被处以极刑。不过我还是同意了这份文件，而且只提了一个建议，即应该说明我随时愿意在任何调查委员会面前递交我自身的证据以及其他人的证据——和一个要求，即应该立刻给我提供一份副本。","Methought I was a good deal sacrificed, and rather represented in the light of a firebrand of a fellow whom my cloud of lawyers had restrained with difficulty from extremes.But I let it pass, and made but the one suggestion, that I should be described as ready to deliver my own evidence and adduce that of others before any commission of inquiry—and the one demand, that I should be immediately furnished with a copy."
"科尔斯顿说话支支吾吾的。“这是一份非常机密的文件。”他说。","Colstoun hummed and hawed.“This is a very confidential document,” said he."
"“而我对普雷斯顿格兰奇的态度非常特别。”我回答道，“毫无疑问，在我们第一次见面时我肯定就已经打动他的心了，所以他自那以后就一直把我当成朋友了。要不是他，先生们，我现在肯定已经死了，或者正和可怜的詹姆斯一起在等待判决呢。正是因为如此，我决定一拿到请愿书的副本，就去把有关实情告诉他。你们也要考虑到这个步骤将会有利于对我的保护。在这里我有一些敌人习惯于步步紧逼，公爵大人在他自己的国家，他的身边有洛瓦特。如果在我们的行动中有任何含糊不清的地方，我想我很有可能一觉醒来就在监狱里了。” ","“And my position towards Prestongrange is highly peculiar,” I replied.“No question but I must have touched his heart at our first interview, so that he has since stood my friend consistently.But for him, gentlemen, I must now be lying dead or awaiting my sentence alongside poor James.For which reason I choose to communicate to him the fact of this memorial as soon as it is copied.You are to consider also that this step will make for my protection.I have enemies here accustomed to drive hard; his Grace is in his own country, Lovat by his side; and if there should hang any ambiguity over our proceedings I think I might very well awake in gaol.”"
"对这些需要考虑的事情，没有找到任何现存的答案，我的这群法律顾问们最后终于达成了一致意见，认为只能是由我去向普雷斯顿格兰奇递交文件并向他表达各方对他的致意。","Not finding any very ready answer to these considerations, my company of advisers were at the last persuaded to consent, and made only this condition that I was to lay the paper before Prestongrange with the express compliments of all concerned."
"检察总长正在城堡里与公爵大人共进晚餐。通过科尔斯顿的一个仆人之手，我递给他一封要求面谈的短笺，跟着就得到回应让我立刻到他城里的私人住宅去见面。在那里我发现他独自一人呆在一个小房间里，从他的脸上看不出任何表情。我并不是个很不注意观察的人，所以发现了大厅里有一些兵器；而且我也没那么愚蠢会猜不到他已经准备好瞅准时机逮捕我。","The Advocate was at the castle dining with his Grace.By the hand of one of Colstoun’s servants I sent him a billet asking for an interview, and received a summons to meet him at once in a private house of the town.Here I found him alone in a chamber; from his face there was nothing to be gleaned; yet I was not so unobservant but what I spied some halberts in the hall, and not so stupid but what I could gather he was prepared to arrest me there and then, should it appear advisable."
"“那么，戴维先生，是你吗？”他说。","“So, Mr. David, this is you?” said he."
"“我担心我并不是很受欢迎，大人。”我说，“我想在我下一步行动前先对大人您的关照表达我的感谢之情，尽管这种关照现在就要终止了。”","“Where I fear I am not overly welcome, my lord,” said I.“And I would like before I go further to express my sense of your lordship’s good offices, even should they now cease.”"
"“我以前已经听你说过感激的话了，”他冷冷地回答道，“而且我想你把我从酒桌上拉过来不可能就是让我听这件事吧。如果我是你，我就还记得自己仍然身陷在非常泥泞的沼泽里。”","“I have heard of your gratitude before,” he replied drily, “and I think this can scarce be the matter you called me from my wine to listen to.I would remember also, if I were you, that you still stand on a very boggy foundation.”"
"“我认为现在不是了，大人，”我说，“如果大人您愿意看一眼这份文件的话，您也许就会和我的想法一样了。”","“Not now, my lord, I think,” said I; “and if your lordship will but glance an eye along this, you will perhaps think as I do.”"
"他从头到尾仔细地看了一遍，紧皱着眉头，然后倒翻回去重新看了一个部分，然后又看了另一个部分，似乎在权衡和比较其效果。他的脸色略微轻松了一些。","He read it sedulously through, frowning heavily; then turned back to one part and another which he seemed to weigh and compare the effect of.His face a little lightened."
"“这并没有那么糟糕，原以为可能会更糟的。”他说，“尽管我还是有可能为结识了戴维·鲍尔弗先生而付出昂贵的代价。”","“This is not so bad but what it might be worse,” said he; “though I am still likely to pay dear for my acquaintance with Mr. David Balfour.”"
"“不如说是因为您袒护了一个不幸的年轻人，大人。”我说。","“Rather for your indulgence to that unlucky young man, my lord,” said I."
"他仍然在浏览文件，他的情绪似乎一直在好转。","He still skimmed the paper, and all the while his spirits seemed to mend."
"“对此我该感谢谁呢？”不一会儿他问道，“我想，其他的辩护律师肯定已经讨论过了。是谁提出采用这种私下处理的方式的？是米勒吗？”","“And to whom am I indebted for this?” he asked presently.“Other counsels must have been discussed, I think.Who was it proposed this private method?Was it Miller?”"
"“大人，是我自己。”我说，“这些绅士告诉我的根本不是这样的方案，照他们那样做，我会失去我自己可以通过正当要求得到的信誉，或者会让他们逃避掉他们理所当然应该承担的责任。 起码的事实就是，他们全部都赞成那种会在议会大厦引起轩然大波的做法，而且那会给他们带来（用他们自己的一句话）一块在滴油的烤肉。 在我进行干涉前，我认为他们正在讨论分派司法界各种不同的职位呢。我们的朋友西蒙先生当时就被纳为需要调整的人了。”","“My lord, it was myself,” said I.“These gentlemen have shown me no such consideration, as that I should deny myself any credit I can fairly claim, or spare them any responsibility they should properly bear.And the mere truth is, that they were all in favour of a process which should have remarkable consequences in the Parliament House, and prove for them (in one of their own expressions) a dripping roast.Before I intervened, I think they were on the point of sharing out the different law appointments.Our friend Mr. Simon was to be taken in upon some composition.”"
"普雷斯顿格兰奇微笑了。“这些人是我们的朋友。”他说，“那么你持不同意见的原因何在呢，戴维先生？”","Prestongrange smiled.“These are our friends,” said he.“And what were your reasons for dissenting, Mr. David?”"
"我毫不隐瞒地将原因全盘托出，不过却着力强调了那些和普雷斯顿格兰奇自身有关的方面。","I told them without concealment, expressing, however, with more force and volume those which regarded Prestongrange himself."
"“你只不过做到对我公正而已。” 他说，“在你与我作对的时候，我都还竭力维护过你的利益。那你今天是怎么到这里来的？”他问，“因为案件延期，我开始不安起来，我本来已经非常顺利地度过了那段时期，我甚至期望你明天回来的。但是今天——我连做梦都没有想到你会来。”","“You do me no more than justice,” said he.“I have fought as hard in your interest as you have fought against mine.And how came you here to-day?” he asked.“As the case drew out, I began to grow uneasy that I had clipped the period so fine, and I was even expecting you to-morrow.But to-day—I never dreamed of it.”"
"当然，我是不会出卖安迪的。","I was not of course, going to betray Andie."
"“我想事情也难免会有意外。”我说。","“I suspect there is some very weary cattle by the road,” said I."
"“如果我早知道你这么匪气十足，就该让你在巴斯多尝一段时间的苦头。”他说。","“If I had known you were such a mosstrooper you should have tasted longer of the Bass,” says he."
"“说到这一点，大人，我要把您的信还给您。”我把那封他故意用左手写的信笺给了他。","“Speaking of which, my lord, I return your letter.”And I gave him the enclosure in the counterfeit hand."
"“这个信封上也盖了印。”他说。","“There was the cover also with the seal,” said he."
"“我没有盖印，”我说，“上面甚至连地址都没有，连一只猫都不可能连累到。我还有第二封短笺，如果您许可的话，我很想留着。”","“I have it not,” said I.“It bore not even an address, and could not compromise a cat.The second enclosure I have, and with your permission, I desire to keep it.”"
"我觉得他有点儿畏缩了，不过他对此并没有说什么。“明天，”他继续说到，“我们在这里的事情就办完了，然后我会路过格拉斯哥。如果能有你为伴，那我会非常开心的，戴维先生。”","I thought he winced a little, but he said nothing to the point.“To-morrow,” he resumed, “our business here is to be finished, and I proceed by Glasgow.I would be very glad to have you of my party, Mr David.”"
"“大人……”我开始说。","“My lord ...” I began."
"“我不否认这是在给我帮忙。”他打断我说道，“我甚至希望，我们到爱丁堡的时候，你会在我家落脚。 你有格兰特小姐们那些非常热心的朋友，她们见到你来会非常高兴的。如果你认为我曾经对你有用的话，你就可以这样轻松地回报我，这样你非但不会有所失，还可以顺便有所得呢。并不是每一个年轻的生面孔都可以出现在皇家检察总长的社交圈子里的。”","“I do not deny it will be of service to me,” he interrupted.“I desire even that, when we shall come to Edinburgh, you should alight at my house.You have very warm friends in the Miss Grants, who will be overjoyed to have you to themselves.If you think I have been of use to you, you can thus easily repay me, and so far from losing, may reap some advantage by the way.It is not every strange young man who is presented in society by the King’s Advocate.”"
"（在我们短暂的交往中）这位先生把我弄得晕头转向已经是常有的事了，无疑这一刻他又这么做了。他老调重弹，仍然是说我特别喜欢和他的女儿们来往，但是他的女儿中有一个对我好到了要取笑我的地步，而另外两个几乎都不愿意屈尊注意到我的存在。而现在我将与这位大人同乘去格拉斯哥，我将在爱丁堡和他同住，我还将被带进在他保护之下的社交圈！他居然如此好心会宽恕我，已经很令人惊讶了。如果说他是想抬举、帮扶我，这似乎又不可能。所以我开始探求其不可告人的意图。有一点是很清楚的。如果我成为了他的客人，就没有后悔的余地了。我再也不可能好好考虑我的计划，并付诸行动了。此外，我出现在他的家里，难道不会把请愿书中的所有辛酸痛苦给抽光吗？因为如果主要受到伤害的人居然是最该被控告的官员的客人，那么就不可能有人会认真对待那些申诉了。我在想到这一点时，差一点儿忍不住要笑了。","Often enough already (in our brief relations) this gentleman had caused my head to spin; no doubt but what for a moment he did so again now.Here was the old fiction still maintained of my particular favour with his daughters, one of whom had been so good as to laugh at me, while the other two had scarce deigned to remark the fact of my existence.And now I was to ride with my lord to Glasgow; I was to dwell with him in Edinburgh; I was to be brought into society under his protection!That he should have so much good-nature as to forgive me was surprising enough; that he could wish to take me up and serve me seemed impossible; and I began to seek some ulterior meaning.One was plain.If I became his guest, repentance was excluded; I could never think better of my present design and bring any action.And besides, would not my presence in his house draw out the whole pungency of the memorial?For that complaint could not be very seriously regarded, if the person chiefly injured was the guest of the official most incriminated.As I thought upon this I could not quite refrain from smiling."
"“这在实质上是和请愿书背道而驰的吧？”我说。","“This is in the nature of a countercheck to the memorial?” said I."
"“你很聪明，戴维先生，”他说，“你并没有完全猜错，这件事会对我的辩护有用。然而，也许你低估了我对你的友情，完全真诚的友情。我对你怀有敬意，戴维，其中还混杂着敬畏。”他微笑着说。","“You are cunning, Mr. David,” said he, “and you do not wholly guess wrong the fact will be of use to me in my defence.Perhaps, however, you underrate friendly sentiments, which are perfectly genuine.I have a respect for you, David, mingled with awe,” says he, smiling."
"“我乐意至极，我诚挚地想要满足您的愿望。”我说，“我的计划是获准步入律师界，对此大人您的支持是无价之宝。此外我还真诚地感谢您本人及您的家人给予我的种种关怀和包容。难就难在这里。有一点把我们拉向了不同的道路。您在竭力要绞死詹姆斯·斯图尔特，而我却在尽力想救他。只要我和您同行就会有利于大人您的辩护，而我则受控于大人您的命令。但是这样会把詹姆斯·斯图尔特送上绞架的，您看我对此深感为难。”","“I am more than willing, I am earnestly desirous to meet your wishes,” said I.“It is my design to be called to the Bar, where your lordship’s countenance would be invaluable; and I am besides sincerely grateful to yourself and family for different marks of interest and of indulgence.The difficulty is here.There is one point in which we pull two ways.You are trying to hang James Stewart, I am trying to save him.In so far as my riding with you would better your lordship’s defence, I am at your lordships orders; but in so far as it would help to hang James Stewart, you see me at a stick.”"
"我觉得他是在对自己发誓。“你一定会获准当律师的，律师界是你施展才华的真正场所。”他说，语带苦涩，然后陷入一阵沉默，“我要告诉你，”不久，他继续说道，“詹姆斯·斯图尔特之事已经盖棺定论，赞成也好，反对也罢，詹姆斯都是一个必死之人。他是生是死——或者说是买（要是你更喜欢这么说的话）还是卖，任何请愿书都帮不上忙了——就算忠实守信的戴维先生有任何徇私之处，也绝不会对他造成什么伤害了。即使再上下奔忙，詹姆斯·斯图尔特都绝不可能得到宽恕。记住我说的话！现在是我自己的问题：我会挺住还是会垮台？对你我并不否认我现在正处于某种危险中。但是戴维·鲍尔弗先生，你会想到这是为什么吗？并不是因为我不适当地推动这个案子来反对詹姆斯。如果是因为那一点，我肯定会得到宽恕的。也不是因为我把戴维先生扣押在礁石上了，虽然找那样的借口就可以过关，而是因为我没有按照既定的简单方式去做，即把戴维先生送进坟墓或者送上绞架，为此有人曾经向我再三施过压。由此出现了丑闻——由此也就有了这该死的请愿书。”他用文件敲着腿，“我对你心太软，害我落入这种困境。我想知道，你是否会良心大发，心肠一软，也帮我来摆脱这个困境呢？”","I thought he swore to himself.“You should certainly be called; the Bar is the true scene for your talents,” says he, bitterly, and then fell a while silent.“I will tell you,” he presently resumed, “there is no question of James Stewart, for or against, James is a dead man; his life is given and taken—bought (if you like it better) and sold; no memorial can help—no defalcation of a faithful Mr. David hurt him.Blow high, blow low, there will be no pardon for James Stewart: and take that for said!The question is now of myself: am I to stand or fall? and I do not deny to you that I am in some danger.But will Mr. David Balfour consider why?It is not because I pushed the case unduly against James; for that, I am sure of condonation.And it is not because I have sequestered Mr. David on a rock, though it will pass under that colour; but because I did not take the ready and plain path, to which I was pressed repeatedly, and send Mr. David to his grave or to the gallows.Hence the scandal—hence this damned memorial,” striking the paper on his leg.“My tenderness for you has brought me in this difficulty.I wish to know if your tenderness to your own conscience is too great to let you help me out of it.”"
"无疑他所说的大部分都是事实。如果帮助詹姆斯为时已晚，那么转而帮助眼前这个人岂不就是顺理成章的事了？他曾经多次帮助过我，而且即使是现在他对我也耐心有加。何况我当时不仅身体疲惫不堪，而且内心也开始为自己那么久都对他持怀疑和拒绝的态度而深感愧疚了。","No doubt but there was much of the truth in what he said; if James was past helping, whom was it more natural that I should turn to help than just the man before me, who had helped myself so often, and was even now setting me a pattern of patience?I was besides not only weary, but beginning to be ashamed, of my perpetual attitude of suspicion and refusal."
"“只要您定好时间和地点，我愿意如期赴约陪伴大人您。”我说。","“If you will name the time and place, I will be punctually ready to attend your lordship,” said I."
"他跟我握了握手。“我想我的女儿们会有一些新消息要告诉你。”他说，然后就让我离开了。","He shook hands with me.“And I think my misses have some news for you,” says he, dismissing me."
"我离开了，为还能保持和平共处而深感高兴，然而良心仍有一点点不安。我往回走的时候，不由地感到怀疑，我是不是心肠太软，顾忌得太多了。但事实上，这是一个也许可以做我父亲的人，一位能干的人，一位显贵高官，而且是一位在我需要帮助时曾出手帮助过我的人。我心情愉悦地尽情享受着那晚余下的时光。那段时光我是和那些律师一起度过的，他们无疑是最好的伴侣。不过我也许潘趣酒喝太多了，因为虽然我早早就上床睡觉了，但是却一点儿都记不清自己是怎么上的床了。","I came away, vastly pleased to have my peace made, yet a little concerned in conscience; nor could I help wondering, as I went back, whether, perhaps, I had not been a scruple too good-natured.But there was the fact, that this was a man that might have been my father, an able man, a great dignitary, and one that, in the hour of my need, had reached a hand to my assistance.I was in the better humour to enjoy the remainder of that evening, which I passed with the advocates, in excellent company no doubt, but perhaps with rather more than a sufficiency of punch: for though I went early to bed I have no clear mind of how I got there."
"第十八章 球座上的球","CHAPTER XVIII—THE TEE’D BALL"
"翌日，在法庭的一个密室里，那里没有人能看见我，我听到了宣判以及对詹姆斯作出的判决。我确信我记住了公爵所说的话。因为他那段著名的话已经成为了一个颇有争议的话题，我不妨也回忆一下我所记得的版本。那位坎贝尔家族的领袖提起了1745年之事，他当时作为主审大法官就坐在审判席上。他对他面前那位不幸的斯图尔特这样说道：“如果你们那场叛乱成功了的话，你就可能成为制定法律的人，而不是像现在这样接受法律的审判了，而我们这些今天担任你的审判官的人，也许倒会被你们那可笑的法庭来审判了。随后你们就会血洗任何一个你们所厌恶的姓氏或者宗族，可能都已经血洗饱了。”","On the morrow, from the justices’ private room, where none could see me, I heard the verdict given in and judgment rendered upon James.The Duke’s words I am quite sure I have correctly; and since that famous passage has been made a subject of dispute, I may as well commemorate my version.Having referred to the year ’45, the chief of the Campbells, sitting as Justice-General upon the bench, thus addressed the unfortunate Stewart before him: “If you had been successful in that rebellion, you might have been giving the law where you have now received the judgment of it; we, who are this day your judges, might have been tried before one of your mock courts of judicature; and then you might have been satiated with the blood of any name or clan to which you had an aversion.”"
"“这的确是一语道破天机了。”我想。而那就是人们的总体印象。特别的是：那群年轻的律师小伙子怎么就抓住了这句话并对此大加嘲讽，说是一顿饭还没有吃完呢，就有人插进这么一句话：“那么你们可能都已经吃饱了。”当时为了打发时间人们创造了很多歌谣，现在几乎全部都已经被人给忘记了。我记得有一首歌谣的开头是这样的：","“This is to let the cat out of the bag, indeed,” thought I.And that was the general impression.It was extraordinary how the young advocate lads took hold and made a mock of this speech, and how scarce a meal passed but what someone would get in the words: “And then you might have been satiated.”Many songs were made in time for the hour’s diversion, and are near all forgot.I remember one began:"
"“你想要什么人的血，什么血？是一个家族，还是一个氏族？或者是那个可怕的高地佬？你想要什么人的血，什么血？”","“What do ye want the bluid of, bluid of?Is it a name, or is it a clan,Or is it an aefauld Hielandman,That ye want the bluid of, bluid of?”"
"另外一首叫做“艾尔利之家”，是用我最喜欢的老腔调唱的，开头是这样的：","Another went to my old favourite air, The House of Airlie, and began thus:"
"“那一天到来，阿盖尔坐上了法官席，他们用斯图尔特招待他当饭吃。”","“It fell on a day when Argyle was on the bench,That they served him a Stewart for his denner.”"
"而且还有一首诗如下：","And one of the verses ran:"
"“公爵起身发了话，并朝厨师大声骂，我认为这是恶意诽谤，我要狂吸猛喝胃吃胀，把那讨厌的对头氏族鲜血喝光。”","“Then up and spak’ the Duke, and flyted on his cook,I regard it as a sensible aspersion,That I would sup ava’, an’ satiate my maw,With the bluid of ony clan of my aversion.”"
"詹姆斯显然是被谋杀的，就好像那位公爵手拿一杆猎枪蹑手蹑脚地在向他逼近。当然我对此甚为清楚：但其他人并不知道那么多，他们更多是受案件审理过程中所暴露的种种丑闻的影响。嘲讽司法的俏皮话里当然也少不了主审法官之一的那位大人。另外还有一个陪审员也对审判百般刁难，他居然中途打断了科尔斯顿为被告作的辩护发言，说了一句：“先生，请你长话短说，我们听得相当烦了，”这似乎也过于无礼和无知了吧。但是我的新律师朋友中还是有人对那种侮辱甚至是破坏司法程序的创新做法感到惊骇不已。有一个证人始终没有被传唤。的确，他的名字都已经打印好了，在名单的第四页上面就可以看到：“詹姆斯·德拉蒙德，又名麦格雷戈，又名詹姆斯·莫尔，曾居住在因维罗纳切利”。他的预审笔录已经以书面的方式递交给了法庭。他所回忆或者杜撰（上帝保佑他）的材料都是为詹姆斯·斯图尔特量身制作的，而且我看出了他是想保护自己。这份证词承载着厚望，希望能引起陪审团的注意，又不会把他本人暴露于受到盘问的危险中。这份证词带进去的方式也让全体在场人员颇感意外。因为这份文件在法庭上是用手传递的（像对待一件珍品），传到陪审团那里时就产生效果了。不过还没等传到为囚犯辩护的律师手上，那份文件又消失了（好像是纯属偶然）。这种做法可以看成是一起最阴险的诡计。而詹姆斯·莫尔的名字掺杂其中，这让我为卡特里奥娜深感羞耻，也为自己担心不已。","James was as fairly murdered as though the Duke had got a fowling-piece and stalked him.So much of course I knew: but others knew not so much, and were more affected by the items of scandal that came to light in the progress of the cause.One of the chief was certainly this sally of the justice’s.It was run hard by another of a juryman, who had struck into the midst of Coulston’s speech for the defence with a “Pray, sir, cut it short, we are quite weary,” which seemed the very excess of impudence and simplicity.But some of my new lawyer friends were still more staggered with an innovation that had disgraced and even vitiated the proceedings.One witness was never called.His name, indeed, was printed, where it may still be seen on the fourth page of the list: “James Drummond, alias Macgregor, alias James More, late tenant in Inveronachile”; and his precognition had been taken, as the manner is, in writing.He had remembered or invented (God help him) matter which was lead in James Stewart’s shoes, and I saw was like to prove wings to his own.This testimony it was highly desirable to bring to the notice of the jury, without exposing the man himself to the perils of cross-examination; and the way it was brought about was a matter of surprise to all.For the paper was handed round (like a curiosity) in court; passed through the jury-box, where it did its work; and disappeared again (as though by accident) before it reached the counsel for the prisoner.This was counted a most insidious device; and that the name of James More should be mingled up with it filled me with shame for Catriona and concern for myself."
"第二天，我和普雷斯顿格兰奇以及人数可观的随从，动身前往格拉斯哥，在那里（让我心焦的是）我们因为娱乐及公务之需而逗留了一段时间。我和检察总长大人一起住，我们之间的亲密关系由此得到了促进。他在宴请时总会给我留位置，还向主要宾客引荐我。总而言之，他对我礼遇有加，超过了我自己认定的角色和身份。因此，有陌生人在场时，我常常替普雷斯顿格兰奇感到脸红。必须得承认，最近几个月以来我对这个世界的看法几乎给我的性格抹上了一层忧郁的色彩。我遇到了很多人，其中有些人不论其出身还是其才能都足以担当以色列的领袖人物了，但是他们之中又有谁是两手干净清白的呢？至于说布朗们和米勒们，我已经见识了他们的自私自利，我绝不可能再尊敬他们了。普雷斯顿格兰奇已经是最好的了，在其他人打主意想直接要我的命时，他曾经救过我，而且还宽恕了我。但是詹姆斯的鲜血在他的门口流淌，而且我认为他目前是披着宽恕的外衣在装模作样给我看。他居然装作以和我谈话为乐，这几乎令人难以置信，无法容忍。我坐在那里看着他，内心藏着隐隐的怒火。“啊，朋友，朋友，”我自己寻思着，“如果你处理完了请愿书之事，难道不会一脚把我给踢到大街上吗？”当时我对他极为不公平，随后的事情也证明了这一点。可现在我认为他比我原先想象的要诚实得多，而且也是个演技相当不错的表演者。","The following day, Prestongrange and I, with a considerable company, set out for Glasgow, where (to my impatience) we continued to linger some time in a mixture of pleasure and affairs.I lodged with my lord, with whom I was encouraged to familiarity; had my place at entertainments; was presented to the chief guests; and altogether made more of than I thought accorded either with my parts or station; so that, on strangers being present, I would often blush for Prestongrange.It must be owned the view I had taken of the world in these last months was fit to cast a gloom upon my character.I had met many men, some of them leaders in Israel whether by their birth or talents; and who among them all had shown clean hands?As for the Browns and Millers, I had seen their self-seeking, I could never again respect them.Prestongrange was the best yet; he had saved me, spared me rather, when others had it in their minds to murder me outright; but the blood of James lay at his door; and I thought his present dissimulation with myself a thing below pardon.That he should affect to find pleasure in my discourse almost surprised me out of my patience.I would sit and watch him with a kind of a slow fire of anger in my bowels.“Ah, friend, friend,” I would think to myself, “if you were but through with this affair of the memorial, would you not kick me in the streets?”Here I did him, as events have proved, the most grave injustice; and I think he was at once far more sincere, and a far more artful performer, than I supposed."
"但是从法庭上那群年轻律师的表现来看，我有理由怀疑他们在周围转悠是希望物色庇护人。对一个闻所未闻的小青年突然很青睐，起初着实让他们感到烦恼并乱了方寸，但是还没过两天我就发现自己被阿谀奉承和关注所包围了。我还是同一个年轻人，既没有更好也没有更俊俏，他们一个月以前还拒绝接受我，而如今却对我再礼貌不过了！还是同一个人，我是这么说的吧？但又并非如此，这一点从他们背后对我的称呼就得到了证实。他们看见我和检察总长关系如此牢靠，都相信我会平步青云，于是用了一个高尔夫球场上的词，把我称作“球座上的球”。我被告知我现在是“他们中的一份子”，我应该去品味他们那种温和以及涵养，他们已经让我感受到自己外表的粗鲁无礼了。有一个人，是我在霍普公园曾被介绍认识的，他非常热心，甚至向我提起了那次会面。我告诉他我不愿意回忆那件事。","But I had some warrant for my incredulity in the behaviour of that court of young advocates that hung about in the hope of patronage.The sudden favour of a lad not previously heard of troubled them at first out of measure; but two days were not gone by before I found myself surrounded with flattery and attention.I was the same young man, and neither better nor bonnier, that they had rejected a month before; and now there was no civility too fine for me!The same, do I say?It was not so; and the by-name by which I went behind my back confirmed it.Seeing me so firm with the Advocate, and persuaded that I was to fly high and far, they had taken a word from the golfing green, and called me the Tee’d Ball.(1)I was told I was now “one of themselves”; I was to taste of their soft lining, who had already made my own experience of the roughness of the outer husk; and one, to whom I had been presented in Hope Park, was so aspired as even to remind me of that meeting.I told him I had not the pleasure of remembering it."
"“咦，”他说，“是格兰特小姐亲自向你介绍我的呢！我名叫某某。”","“Why，” says he, “it was Miss Grant herself presented me!My name is so-and-so.”"
"“那很好，先生，”我说，“但是我根本就不记得了。”","“It may very well be, sir,” said I; “but I have kept no mind of it.”"
"听到这话他不再吭声了，通常我的内心对此都很反感的，此刻反感中却有那么一丝快感了。","At which he desisted; and in the midst of the disgust that commonly overflowed my spirits I had a glisk of pleasure."
"不过我没有耐心详细地叙述那段时间。和这群年轻的政客在一起时，我觉得很压抑沮丧，我既为自己以及自身直率简单的处事方式而感到羞愧，又瞧不起他们以及他们的圆滑世故。  在这两种罪恶中，我都没有想到普雷斯顿格兰奇。当我总是摆出一副生硬拘谨的样子对那些年轻人的时候，其实我是在掩饰自己对检察总长还心存芥蒂，也就是（用老坎贝尔先生的话）“对领主应该温顺”。他自己对此看法截然不同，他叮嘱我要多结交同龄人，而且要我和那些年轻伙伴们交朋友。","But I have not patience to dwell upon that time at length.When I was in company with these young politics I was borne down with shame for myself and my own plain ways, and scorn for them and their duplicity.Of the two evils, I thought Prestongrange to be the least; and while I was always as stiff as buckram to the young bloods, I made rather a dissimulation of my hard feelings towards the Advocate, and was (in old Mr. Campbell’s word) “soople to the laird.”Himself commented on the difference, and bid me be more of my age, and make friends with my young comrades."
"我告诉他我在交朋友方面很迟钝。","I told him I was slow of making friends."
"“那我就收回那句话。”他说，“不过有这么一句话叫做‘一分耕耘，一分收获’，戴维先生。这些人和你一样都是年轻人，你将和他们一起度过很多岁月，乃至一生。你的腼腆中透着一种傲慢的神色，除非你能采取更愉快轻松的方式，否则我担心你今后会遇到重重困难。”","“I will take the word back,” said he.“But there is such a thing as Fair gude s’en and fair gude day, Mr. David.These are the same young men with whom you are to pass your days and get through life: your backwardness has a look of arrogance; and unless you can assume a little more lightness of manner, I fear you will meet difficulties in the path.”"
"“要用猪耳朵做个丝钱包恐怕不是一件容易的事。”我说。","“It will be an ill job to make a silk purse of a sow’s ear,” said I."
"10月1号早晨我被快递马车的嘈杂声吵醒了。信使差不多一到我的窗户边就下了马，我看出他骑马骑得非常辛苦。没过多久我就被叫到普雷斯顿格兰奇那里，他身穿睡衣、头戴睡帽坐在那里，周围摆着他的信件。","On the morning of October 1st I was awakened by the clattering in of an express; and getting to my window almost before he had dismounted, I saw the messenger had ridden hard.Somewhile after I was called to Prestongrange, where he was sitting in his bedgown and nightcap, with his letters round him."
"“戴维先生，”他说，“我有一个消息要告诉你。这个消息和你的一些朋友有关，我有时候觉得你有点儿愧对他们，因为你从来没有提到过他们的存在。”","“Mr. David,” add he, “I have a piece of news for you.It concerns some friends of yours, of whom I sometimes think you are a little ashamed, for you have never referred to their existence.”"
"我想我的脸红了。","I suppose I blushed."
"“看来你清楚，因为你作出了回应，”他说，“我必须得称赞你对美好东西的卓越品味。但是，戴维先生，你知道吗？在我看来这可是一位非常有魄力的姑娘。她出其不意地冒了出来。看样子苏格兰政府还无法对凯特琳·德拉蒙德小姐之事进行处理，在某种程度上这个案子（就在不久以前）还和一位戴维·鲍尔弗先生有关联。难道这两个人不该是很相配的一对吗？她是第一次介入政治——不过我不能告诉你详情，当局已经决定你会从从另一位更加生动的讲述者那里听说这件事情。然而，这起新案例更为严重。恐怕我不得不警告你，有消息说她目前在监狱里。” ","“See you understand, since you make the answering signal,” said he.“And I must compliment you on your excellent taste in beauty.But do you know, Mr. David? this seems to me a very enterprising lass.She crops up from every side.The Government of Scotland appears unable to proceed for Mistress Katrine Drummond, which was somewhat the case (no great while back) with a certain Mr. David Balfour.Should not these make a good match?Her first intromission in politics—but I must not tell you that story, the authorities have decided you are to hear it otherwise and from a livelier narrator.This new example is more serious, however; and I am afraid I must alarm you with the intelligence that she is now in prison.”"
"我大声叫喊起来。","I cried out."
"“是的，”他说，“那位年轻女士是在监狱里。但我还不会让你绝望的。除非你（和你的朋友们以及请愿书一起）成心害我垮台，否则她是不会遭任何罪的。”","“Yes,” said he, “the little lady is in prison.But I would not have you to despair.Unless you (with your friends and memorials) shall procure my downfall, she is to suffer nothing.”"
"“但是她做了什么呀？她犯了什么罪？”我叫道。","“But what has she done?What is her offence?” I cried."
"“差不多可以理解为叛国罪，”他回答，“因为她制造了皇家爱丁堡城堡的越狱事件。”","“It might be almost construed a high treason,” he returned, “for she has broke the king’s Castle of Edinburgh.”"
"“那位女士是我非常重要的朋友。”我说，“我知道，如果事态严重的话，你是不会戏弄我的。”","“The lady is much my friend,” I said.“I know you would not mock me if the thing were serious.”"
"“但是，这件事在某种意义上来说很严重，”他说，“因为这个调皮捣蛋的凯特琳——或者凯特兰，我们这么称呼她——居然把一个非常可疑的人物，即她的爸爸给重新放归自由世界了。”","“And yet it is serious in a sense,” said he; “for this rogue of a Katrine—or Cateran, as we may call her—has set adrift again upon the world that very doubtful character, her papa.”"
"这证实了我的一个预见：詹姆斯·莫尔再一次自由了。他曾经派他的手下囚禁了我，他曾经自愿为阿平案件提供证词，而且这一证词（不论采用的是何种计策）又被用来影响了陪审团的判决。现在他得到回报了，他自由了。给这件事情抹上一层逃亡的色彩可能会取悦于当局，但是我更加清楚——我清楚这一定是达成了某种交易。正是这一想法使我大为宽心，一点儿也不担心卡特里奥娜了。可能大家都以为她是为了她父亲才越狱的，也许她自己也是这么认为的。但是整件事情的幕后主谋却是普雷斯顿格兰奇。我敢肯定，他不仅不会判她刑，相反他甚至都不会让她受审判。于是我未经慎重考虑便脱口而出：","Here was one of my previsions justified: James More was once again at liberty.He had lent his men to keep me a prisoner; he had volunteered his testimony in the Appin case, and the same (no matter by what subterfuge) had been employed to influence the jury.Now came his reward, and he was free.It might please the authorities to give to it the colour of an escape; but I knew better—I knew it must be the fulfilment of a bargain.The same course of thought relieved me of the least alarm for Catriona.She might be thought to have broke prison for her father; she might have believed so herself.But the chief hand in the whole business was that of Prestongrange; and I was sure, so far from letting her come to punishment, he would not suffer her to be even tried.Whereupon thus came out of me the not very politic ejaculation:"
"“啊！我料到会是那样的！”","“Ah! I was expecting that!”"
"“你有时候也很有判断力啊！”普雷斯顿格兰奇说。","“You have at times a great deal of discretion, too!” says Prestongrange."
"“大人您这话是什么意思呢？”我问。","“And what is my lord pleased to mean by that?” I asked."
"“我只是觉得很惊讶，”他回答，“你很聪明，居然能得出这样的推论，但是你没有做到心知肚明，那又不够聪明了。不过我认为你很想听听此事的详情。我得到了两个版本：至少官方的更加全面，而更加有趣的则是出自我长女那栩栩如生的描写了。‘现在全城都在为一件大事议论纷纷，’她写道，‘而把这件事弄得众人皆知的犯事者居然就是（如果人们只知道这一点的话）一位受检察总长大人即我的爸爸所保护的女子。我肯定您的心里过多想着您的职责（如果没有其他什么事情的话），所以已经忘记了那位灰眼睛姑娘。她做了什么？她只不过戴了一顶边沿已经开口子的宽边帽，穿了一件磨损毛边的男式长大衣，披了一条大围裙。天知道她为什么要把大衣卷起来，她脚蹬一双高筒长靴，走起路来啪嗒啪嗒响，手上还拿着一双补好的粗革皮鞋，就这样直奔城堡而去! 她声称自己是詹姆斯·莫尔雇佣的一名补鞋匠，获得许可进了他的单人牢房，那位中尉（似乎非常幽默诙谐）还在士兵面前嗤笑这补鞋匠的大衣。不久他们听到里面传出争吵声和殴打声。补鞋匠飞快跑了出来，他的大衣飘动，帽子的边沿拍打在他的脸上。在他跑掉的时候，中尉和士兵都在嘲笑他。但是接下来他们就不可能笑得那么开心了。他们偶然去那间牢房看了看，发现里面只有一位身着女装、高挑漂亮的灰眼睛少女！至于那个补鞋匠，他早已经翻过了邓布兰附近的山岗。不过人们认为没了他，可怜的苏格兰将不得不自己安慰自己。当天晚上我当众为卡特里奥娜的健康干了杯。","“I was just marvelling”, he replied, “that being so clever as to draw these inferences, you should not be clever enough to keep them to yourself.But I think you would like to hear the details of the affair.I have received two versions: and the least official is the more full and far the more entertaining, being from the lively pen of my eldest daughter.‘Here is all the town bizzing with a fine piece of work,’ she writes, ‘and what would make the thing more noted (if it were only known) the malefactor is a protégée of his lordship my papa.I am sure your heart is too much in your duty (if it were nothing else) to have forgotten Grey Eyes.What does she do, but get a broad hat with the flaps open, a long hairy-like man’s greatcoat, and a big gravatt; kilt her coats up to Gude kens whaur, clap two pair of boot-hose upon her legs, take a pair of clouted brogues(2) in her hand, and off to the Castle!Here she gives herself out to be a soutar(3) in the employ of James More, and gets admitted to his cell, the lieutenant (who seems to have been full of pleasantry) making sport among his soldiers of the soutar’s greatcoat.Presently they hear disputation and the sound of blows inside.Out flies the cobbler, his coat flying, the flaps of his hat beat about his face, and the lieutenant and his soldiers mock at him as he runs off.They laughed no so hearty the next time they had occasion to visit the cell and found nobody but a tall, pretty, grey-eyed lass in the female habit!As for the cobbler, he was ‘over the hills ayout Dumblane,’ and it’s thought that poor Scotland will have to console herself without him.I drank Catriona’s health this night in public."
"事实上，全城的人都钦佩她。我想只要弄得到，那些崇拜她的公子哥就一定会在他们的纽扣孔里穿一截她的吊袜带。我也想去监狱探访她，只是我立马想起我是爸爸的女儿，所以我就没去，而是给她写了一张便条，委托忠实的多伊格送了过去。我希望只要我愿意，您就会同意我也参与一点点政治。那个忠实的傻瓜将乘坐快递马车去送这封信，车上还有一些自以为是的人，所以您会听说大傻瓜居然和智者所罗门为伴了。谈到傻瓜，请一定告诉戴维·鲍尔弗。一想到那位长腿少女陷入这样的困境，我的眼前就会出现他的脸庞。不要数落您亲爱的女儿的轻率，也不要责怪他那位有礼貌的朋友。’下面就是我那淘气鬼女儿自己的签名！”普雷斯顿格兰奇继续说，“你要知道，戴维先生，我告诉你的完全属实，我的那些女儿们虽然顽皮淘气，但对你的感情却非常诚挚。”","Indeed, the whole town admires her; and I think the beaux would wear bits of her garters in their button-holes if they could only get them.I would have gone to visit her in prison too, only I remembered in time I was papa’s daughter; so I wrote her a billet instead, which I entrusted to the faithful Doig, and I hope you will admit I can be political when I please.The same faithful gomeral is to despatch this letter by the express along with those of the wiseacres, so that you may hear Tom Fool in company with Solomon.Talking of gomerals, do tell Dauvit Balfour.I would I could see the face of him at the thought of a long-legged lass in such a predicament; to say nothing of the levities of your affectionate daughter, and his respectful friend.’So my rascal signs herself!” continued Prestongrange.“And you see, Mr. David, it is quite true what I tell you, that my daughters regard you with the most affectionate playfulness.”"
"“傻瓜感激万分。”我说。","“The gomeral is much obliged,” said I."
"“这件事难道做得还不漂亮！”他继续说，“那位高地女孩难道不是一块女英雄的料吗？”","“And was not this prettily done!” he went on.“Is not this Highland maid a piece of a heroine?”"
"“我一直都确信她有一颗伟大的心，”我说，“但我打赌她根本就没猜对……不过我要请你原谅，我这是踩上禁忌话题了。”","“I was always sure she had a great heart,” said I.“And I wager she guessed nothing...But I beg your pardon, this is to tread upon forbidden subjects.”"
"“我要保证她没有猜对。”他相当坦率地回答道，“我要保证她的想法就是要直接面见乔治国王。”","“I will go bail she did not,” he returned, quite openly.“I will go bail she thought she was flying straight into King George’s face.”"
"回忆起卡特里奥娜而且想到她还被监禁着，这让我异常感动。我看得出甚至连普雷斯顿格兰奇都钦佩她，他在想到她的所作所为时都无法抑制嘴角的微笑。至于格兰特小姐，尽管她有冷嘲热讽的坏习惯，可是她的钦佩之情表露无遗。一股暖流涌上我心头。","Remembrance of Catriona and the thought of her lying in captivity, moved me strangely.I could see that even Prestongrange admired, and could not withhold his lips from smiling when he considered her behaviour.As for Miss Grant, for all her ill habit of mockery, her admiration shone out plain.A kind of a heat came on me."
"“我可不是大人您的女儿……”我开始说。","“I am not your lordship’s daughter...” I began."
"“我知道！”他微笑着插话。","“That I know of!” he put in, smiling."
"“我说话就像一个傻瓜，”我说，“或者不如说我一开始就错了。毫无疑问格兰特小姐去监狱看她是很不明智的，但是对我来说，我想如果我不立刻飞奔去那里的话，我就不像一个全心全意的朋友了。”","“I speak like a fool,” said I; “or rather I began wrong.It would doubtless be unwise in Mistress Grant to go to her in prison; but for me, I think I would look like a half-hearted friend if I did not fly there instantly.”"
"“那么，戴维先生，”他说，“我怎么觉得你和我是在谈一笔交易呢？”","“So-ho, Mr. David,” says he; “I thought that you and I were in a bargain?”"
"“大人，”我说，“如果谈成了这笔交易，我会为您的善良感动万分的。但是我绝不可能否认我是受一己私利所驱使的。我心里只想着自己，现在我为此感到很惭愧。就说这个讨厌的戴维·鲍尔弗是您的朋友和房客吧，这样兴许可以顾全大人您的安全。就那么说吧，我绝不会反驳的。但是至于您对我的庇护，我将全部奉还。我只要求一件事情——就是让我走，给我一张通行证让我去监狱看望她。”","“My lord,” I said, “when I made that bargain I was a good deal affected by your goodness, but I’ll never can deny that I was moved besides by my own interest.There was self-seeking in my heart, and I think shame of it now.It may be for your lordship’s safety to say this fashious Davie Balfour is your friend and housemate.Say it then; I’ll never contradict you.But as for your patronage, I give it all back.I ask but the one thing—let me go, and give me a pass to see her in her prison.”"
"他用严厉的眼光看着我。“我认为你是本末倒置了。”他说， “我曾经给予你的只是我的一份好感，而这一点因你本性不识好歹似乎还没有注意到呢。但是说到我的庇护，我既没有给过，（准确地说）也不会提供。”他停了一会儿。“我警告你，你不了解你自己。”他补充道，“青春是个行事轻率的阶段，再长大一点儿，你就会把这一切考虑得更周全的。”","He looked at me with a hard eye.“You put the cart before the horse, I think,” says he.“That which I had given was a portion of my liking, which your thankless nature does not seem to have remarked.But for my patronage, it is not given, nor (to be exact) is it yet offered.”He paused a bit.“And I warn you, you do not know yourself,” he added.“Youth is a hasty season; you will think better of all this before a year.”"
"“唉，我就愿意当那样的年轻人！”我叫道，“上一次宴会上我已经在那群年轻的律师身上见得太多了，他们奉承巴结大人您，甚至还费尽心机地讨好我。 我在那些老律师身上也见到过这种谄媚。他们都是别有用心，他们那一大帮人全都如此！正是这一点似乎让我对大人您的好感有所怀疑了。我凭什么认为您会喜欢我呢？但是您告诉过我说您是有您自己的利益！”","“Well, and I would like to be that kind of youth!” I cried.“I have seen too much of the other party in these young advocates that fawn upon your lordship and are even at the pains to fawn on me.And I have seen it in the old ones also.They are all for by-ends, the whole clan of them!It’s this that makes me seem to misdoubt your lordship’s liking.Why would I think that you would like me?But ye told me yourself ye had an interest!”"
"说到此我停了下来，为自己跑题太远而不知所措，他则带着一副高深莫测的表情在观察着我。","I stopped at this, confounded that I had run so far; he was observing me with an unfathomable face."
"“大人，我请您原谅，”我继续说道，“我什么也不会说，只会说一口粗鲁的乡下话。我认为如果我去看望看望被监禁的朋友，也还是说得过去的。不过我欠了您一条命——这一点我永远都不会忘记。如果是为了大人您好，那我会留在这里的。那仅仅是为了表示感谢而已。” ","“My lord, I ask your pardon,” I resumed.“I have nothing in my chafts but a rough country tongue.I think it would be only decent-like if I would go to see my friend in her captivity; but I’m owing you my life—I’ll never forget that; and if it’s for your lordship’s good, here I’ll stay.That’s barely gratitude.”"
"“这也许只用几句话就可以表示了。”普雷斯顿格兰奇冷冷地说，“这很容易，有时候简单地说声苏格兰语‘唉’就很亲切了。”","“This might have been reached in fewer words,” says Prestongrange grimly.“It is easy, and it is at times gracious, to say a plain Scots ‘ay’.”"
"“啊，可是，大人，我想您还不完全了解我！”我叫道，“为了您，为了我的人身安全，也为了您所说的您对我的好意——为了这一切，我会同意留下，但是我同意留下来绝不是因为可能给我本人带来任何好处。如果我在这位年轻姑娘受审判的时候居然袖手旁观的话，那样做对我绝不会有好处。我会因此蒙受损失，我永远都不会有所得了。 我宁愿彻底葬身海难也不愿意那么去做。”","“Ah, but, my lord, I think ye take me not yet entirely!” cried I.“For your sake, for my life-safe, and the kindness that ye say ye bear to me—for these, I’ll consent; but not for any good that might be coming to myself.If I stand aside when this young maid is in her trial, it’s a thing I will be noways advantaged by; I will lose by it, I will never gain.I would rather make a shipwreck wholly than to build on that foundation.”"
"他表情严肃了片刻，随后微笑了。“你让我想起了一个长鼻子的人，”他说，“你用望远镜去看月亮，你会看见戴维·鲍尔弗在那上面！不过你可以按你的方式去做。我只要求你帮我做一件事，然后就给你自由。我那些办事员负担都太重了，请你务必帮我把这几页文件誊抄一下。这件事做完以后，我就会祝你一路顺风！我绝不会去对戴维先生的良心负责，如果你可以把你的一部分良心（在你经过的时候）扔进长满苔癣的沼泽坑里，你会发现没有它你跑起来都轻松得多了。”","He was a minute serious, then smiled.“You mind me of the man with the long nose,” said he; “was you to see the moon by a telescope you would see David Balfour there!But you shall have your way of it.I will ask at you one service, and then set you free: My clerks are overdriven; be so good as copy me these few pages, and when that is done, I shall bid you God speed!I would never charge myself with Mr. David’s conscience; and if you could cast some part of it (as you went by) in a moss hag, you would find yourself to ride much easier without it.”"
"“话虽如此，但是也许我根本就没有朝那个方向去，大人！”我说。","“Perhaps not just entirely in the same direction though, my lord!” says I."
"“那你也要记住最后一句话！”他开心地叫道。","“And you shall have the last word, too!” cries he gaily."
"确实，他有理由高兴，因为他现在发现了达到目的的方法。 为了减轻那份请愿书的份量，或者是为了手头有一份准备好的答案，他都希望我在公众场合以其亲密朋友的身份出现。但是如果我公开现身却是去探访被监禁的卡特里奥娜，世人就难以得出上述结论了，那么詹姆斯·莫尔逃跑的真相就会大白于天下了。这是我突然给他提出的一个小难题，而他非常迅捷地找到了解决的办法。 我将被困在格拉斯哥做誊抄工作，这一点是我仅仅出于表面的礼貌都无法拒绝的。而在我被雇佣的这几个小时里，他们就会把卡特里奥娜给秘密地除掉了。这么去写这个对我满心善意的人，我想想就感到惭愧。他待我很好，犹如慈父，然而我曾经把他想得像一个破钟那么坏。","Indeed, he had some cause for gaiety, having now found the means to gain his purpose.To lessen the weight of the memorial, or to have a readier answer at his hand, he desired I should appear publicly in the character of his intimate.But if I were to appear with the same publicity as a visitor to Catriona in her prison the world would scarce stint to draw conclusions, and the true nature of James More’s escape must become evident to all.This was the little problem I had to set him of a sudden, and to which he had so briskly found an answer.I was to be tethered in Glasgow by that job of copying, which in mere outward decency I could not well refuse; and during these hours of employment Catriona was privately got rid of.I think shame to write of this man that loaded me with so many goodnesses.He was kind to me as any father, yet I ever thought him as false as a cracked bell."
"第十九章 我在淑女们的掌控之下","CHAPTER XIX—I AM MUCH IN THE HANDS OF THE LADIES"
"誊抄是一件让人心烦的活儿，当我很早发觉这根本就不是亟待处理的事情时，这种感觉尤为强烈。所以我从一开始就觉得让我做这件事只不过是个托词而已。我一完成任务就上了马，乘着天色未晚拼命往目的地赶去。最后到夜幕深沉之时，我才投宿于阿蒙德河边的一家客栈。天尚未破晓，我又上马启程了。爱丁堡的货摊才刚开张，我已经伴着马蹄声穿过西拱门，在检察总长大人家门前勒住了大汗淋漓的马。我带了一封检察总长大人的亲笔函给多伊格——一位平凡而可敬的小个子男人，他满身肥肉、气喘吁吁却很志得意满。多伊格是检察总长大人的私人助手，大家都认为他参与了那位大人所有的机密事宜。我发现他就在我曾和詹姆斯·莫尔相遇的那个接待室里，他已经坐在书桌旁，鼻孔边沾满了湿乎乎的鼻烟。他小心翼翼地读了那封短信，就像是在读《圣经》里的一个章节。","The copying was a weary business, the more so as I perceived very early there was no sort of urgency in the matters treated, and began very early to consider my employment a pretext.I had no sooner finished than I got to horse, used what remained of daylight to the best purpose, and being at last fairly benighted, slept in a house by Almond-Water side.I was in the saddle again before the day, and the Edinburgh booths were just opening when I clattered in by the West Bow and drew up a smoking horse at my lord Advocate’s door.I had a written word for Doig, my lord’s private hand that was thought to be in all his secrets—a worthy little plain man, all fat and snuff and self-sufficiency.Him I found already at his desk and already bedabbled with maccabaw, in the same anteroom where I rencountered with James More.He read the note scrupulously through like a chapter in his Bible."
"“嗯，”他说，“你若早来一步就是小事一桩了，鲍尔弗先生。那只小鸟已经飞了——我们放她出去的。”","“H’m,” says he; “ye come a wee thing ahint-hand, Mr. Balfour.The bird’s flaen—we hae letten her out.”"
"“德拉蒙德小姐已经被释放了？”我叫道。","“Miss Drummond is set free?” I cried."
"“伤脑筋啊！”他说，“我们为什么要关着她呢？把一个小孩给关了起来，任何人都不会高兴的。”","“Achy!” said he.“What would we keep her for, ye ken?To hae made a steer about the bairn would has pleased naebody.”"
"“那么她现在会在哪里呢？”我说。","“And where’ll she be now?” says I."
"“天知道！”多伊格耸了耸肩膀说道。","“Gude kens!” says Doig, with a shrug."
"“我想，她应该是回阿勒代斯夫人家去了。”我说。","“She’ll have gone home to Lady Allardyce, I’m thinking,” said I."
"“应该是那样吧。”他说。","“That’ll be it,” said he."
"“那么我就直接去那里。”我说。","“Then I’ll gang there straight,” says I."
"“可是你先吃点儿饭再走吧？”他说。","“But ye’ll be for a bite or ye go?” said he."
"“不吃也不喝了，”我说，“我经过拉所时喝了不少牛奶。”","“Neither bite nor sup,” said I.“I had a good wauch of milk in by Ratho.”"
"“好吧，好吧。”多伊格说，“不过你可以把马和行李留在这里，因为看样子你只能走路去了。”","“Aweel, aweel,” says Doig.“But ye’ll can leave your horse here and your bags, for it seems we’re to have your up-put.”"
"“没事，没事。”我说，“徒步行走对于我来说从来就不算回事，今天如此，永远如此。” ","“Na, na”, said I.“Tamson’s mear(1) would never be the thing for me this day of all days.”"
"由于多伊格说话口音有点儿重，我不由地跟着模仿他的口音，比我平时说话时刻意发出的乡音还土一些，事实上，比我写下来的还要土得多。这时我身后响起了另外一个声音，唱的是一段歌谣，让我越发觉得不好意思了。","Doig speaking somewhat broad, I had been led by imitation into an accent much more countrified than I was usually careful to affect a good deal broader, indeed, than I have written it down; and I was the more ashamed when another voice joined in behind me with a scrap of a ballad:"
"“备好鞍给我的黑骏马，鞍备好就整装待发。我要奔向那恬静的希望之门，要去看望我美丽的心上人。”","“Gae saddle me the bonny black,Gae saddle sune and mak’ him readyFor I will down the Gatehope-slack,And a’ to see my bonny leddy.”"
"我转过身去，看到那位年轻女士穿着晨袍站在那里，她的双手拢在晨袍的袖子里，仿佛要跟我保持一段距离。不过我只是觉得她看我时眼里满含着善意。","The young lady, when I turned to her, stood in a morning gown, and her hands muffled in the same, as if to hold me at a distance.Yet I could not but think there was kindness in the eye with which she saw me."
"“向你致以最崇高的敬意，格兰特小姐。”我边鞠躬边说。","“My best respects to you, Mistress Grant,” said I, bowing."
"“也向你致意，戴维先生。”她非常有礼地回答道，“我提请你记住一句古老而已经过时的谚语，‘盛宴和弥撒都留不住客人’。我不能为你做弥撒，因为我们都是虔诚的新教徒。但是盛宴我要恳请你能赏脸。我有些事情想私下里跟你谈谈，这些事情会值得你留步的，对此我毫不怀疑。”","“The like to yourself, Mr. David,” she replied with a deep courtesy.“And I beg to remind you of an old musty saw, that meat and mass never hindered man.The mass I cannot afford you, for we are all good Protestants.But the meat I press on your attention.And I would not wonder but I could find something for your private ear that would be worth the stopping for.”"
"“格兰特小姐，”我说，“我认为有些开心话——写在一封没有署名的信里——已经让我亏欠你很多了，而且我觉得那些话也同样充满了善意。”","“Mistress Grant,” said I, “I believe I am already your debtor for some merry words—and I think they were kind too—on a piece of unsigned paper.”"
"“没有署名的信？”她说，然后扮了一个滑稽的鬼脸，像是在竭力回忆似的，但是模样依然出奇地美丽。","“Unsigned paper?” says she, and made a droll face, which was likewise wondrous beautiful, as of one trying to remember."
"“要不然就是我受骗了。”我继续说，“但是可以肯定，我们会有时间来谈这些事的，因为你父亲已经好心让我和你们一起相处一段时间。这个傻瓜现在只求你开恩给他自由吧。”","“Or else I am the more deceived,” I went on.“But to be sure, we shall have the time to speak of these, since your father is so good as to make me for a while your inmate; and the gomeral begs you at this time only for the favour of his liberty,”"
"“你这是自己骂自己呀。”她说。","“You give yourself hard names,” said she."
"“我和多伊格先生都很乐意任由你的妙笔来骂得更狠一些。”我说。","“Mr. Doig and I would be blythe to take harder at your clever pen,” says I."
"“我不得不再一次对所有男子汉的辨别力表示钦佩。”她回答，“不过你要是不打算吃饭的话，就赶紧走人吧。你很快就会回来的，因为你会白跑一趟。你走吧，戴维先生。”她一边打开门一边继续说道，","“Once more I have to admire the discretion of all men-folk,” she replied.“But if you will not eat, off with you at once; you will be back the sooner, for you go on a fool’s errand.Off with you, Mr. David,” she continued, opening the door."
"“他一跃而起去找他那美丽的灰眼睛，他骑马直奔大门却早已不见踪影。我认为他既不会停脚也不会逗留，因为他正在找寻他美丽的心上人。”","“He has lowpen on his bonny grey,He rade the richt gate and the readyI trow he would neither stint nor stay,For he was seeking his bonny leddy.”"
"我没有等第二声吩咐，就如格兰特小姐歌谣所言的那样，一路直往迪安村奔去。","I did not wait to be twice bidden, and did justice to Miss Grant’s citation on the way to Dean."
"阿勒代斯老太太在花园里独自散着步，她戴着亚麻布女帽，靠着一根镶了银的黑木拐杖。我下了马，走到她跟前并向她鞠了躬。我可以看到血涌上了她的脸，她的头在空中摆动着，就像我想象中的女皇那样。","Old Lady Allardyce walked there alone in the garden, in her hat and mutch, and having a silver-mounted staff of some black wood to lean upon.As I alighted from my horse, and drew near to her with congees, I could see the blood come in her face, and her head fling into the air like what I had conceived of empresses."
"“什么风把你吹到寒舍来了？”她用鼻音高声叫道，“我阻拦不了你。我家里的男人都死了也埋了。我既没有儿子也没有丈夫来帮我守护家门，任何长胡子的乞丐都可以打劫我——现在就有一个长胡子的，那该是最糟糕的吧？”她补充道，部分是说给自己听的。","“What brings you to my poor door?” she cried, speaking high through her nose.“I cannot bar it.The males of my house are dead and buried; I have neither son nor husband to stand in the gate for me; any beggar can pluck me by the baird(2)—and a baird there is, and that’s the worst of it yet?” she added partly to herself."
"受到这种接待，我觉得非常恼火，尤其最后那一句话，就像是一个疯婆子说的，让我几乎无语了。","I was extremely put out at this reception, and the last remark, which seemed like a daft wife’s, left me near hand speechless."
"“我知道我是碰到你心情不好的时候了，夫人，”我说，“但是我还是要冒昧问候一下德拉蒙德小姐。”","“I see I have fallen under your displeasure, ma’am,” said I.“Yet I will still be so bold as ask after Mistress Drummond.”"
"她用愤怒的眼神打量着我，她的双唇紧紧抿出了足二十条皱纹，她拄在拐杖上的手在颤抖着。“这吓倒所有人了！”她叫道，“你到我这里来就是为了找她？天哪，我知道就好了！”","She considered me with a burning eye, her lips pressed close together into twenty creases, her hand shaking on her staff.“This cows all!” she cried.“Ye come to me to speir for her?Would God I knew!”"
"“她不在这里？”我叫道。","“She is not here?” I cried."
"她努努下巴，向前跨一步，对着我大叫一声，于是我不由自主地就往后退缩。","She threw up her chin and made a step and a cry at me, so that I fell back incontinent."
"“滚出去，你这个靠人庇护的家伙！”她叫道，“什么！你来找我要人！她在监狱里，是你带她去的——是你把所有的人都带到那里面去了。我在这里看见的穿马裤的人，想来就只有你一个！你这没出息的无赖，如果我有自家的男人，我会让他打得你屁滚尿流滚出去。”","“Out upon your leeing throat!” she cried.“What! ye come and speir at me!She’s in jyle, whaur ye took her to—that’s all there is to it.And of a’ the beings ever I beheld in breeks, to think it should be to you!Ye timmer scoun’rel, if I had a male left to my name I would have your jaicket dustit till ye raired.”"
"我觉得在那个地方再呆下去也没什么用了，因为我注意到她的情绪越来越激动。我转向拴马柱，她居然还跟着我。我并不羞于承认，我策马离开的时候，一只脚在马镫上，但另一只脚却还在费劲地找马镫呢。","I thought it not good to delay longer in that place, because I remarked her passion to be rising.As I turned to the horse-post she even followed me; and I make no shame to confess that I rode away with the one stirrup on and scrambling for the other."
"因为我清楚没有其他地方可以做进一步打探，所以我别无选择，只好返回检察总长大人的家中。我颇受那四位女士的欢迎，她们现在都聚在一起，肯定就会传播有关普雷斯顿格兰奇的消息以及苏格兰西部广为流传的消息。对我自己而言，这段时间太久，而且我感到极其厌倦。期间那位年轻的女士一直面带嘲弄地在观察我，一副看到我急躁不安就很高兴的样子，而我则非常渴望能和她再次单独相处。最后，在我耐着性子和她们吃完晚饭后，当着她姑妈的面恳求和她单独约见的时刻就快要到了。她走到乐谱夹旁边站着，选定了一个声调，用女高音唱了起来——“他可以做时不愿意做，他愿意做时又不能做。”不过她对我的刁难到此结束了。不久，她就找了一个我已记不清的借口，悄悄把我带到了她父亲的藏书室。我不能不说一说，她那天打扮得非常漂亮，显得特别端庄。","As I knew no other quarter where I could push my inquiries, there was nothing left me but to return to the Advocate’s.I was well received by the four ladies, who were now in company together, and must give the news of Prestongrange and what word went in the west country, at the most inordinate length and with great weariness to myself; while all the time that young lady, with whom I so much desired to be alone again, observed me quizzically and seemed to find pleasure in the sight of my impatience.At last, after I had endured a meal with them, and was come very near the point of appealing for an interview before her aunt, she went and stood by the music-case, and picking out a tune, sang to it on a high key—“He that will not when he may, When he will he shall have nay.”But this was the end of her rigours, and presently, after making some excuse of which I have no mind, she carried me away in private to her father’s library.I should not fail to say she was dressed to the nines, and appeared extraordinary handsome."
"“现在，戴维先生，你请坐在这里，让我们两个人好好聊一聊。”她说，“因为我有很多话要告诉你，不过好像我说的话和你的高雅品味很不相称。”","“Now, Mr. David, sit ye down here and let us have a two-handed crack,” said she.“For I have much to tell you, and it appears besides that I have been grossly unjust to your good taste.”"
"“这话怎么说，格兰特小姐？”我问，“我相信我似乎对你还从没有缺过应该有的尊重吧。”","“In what manner, Mistress Grant?”I asked.“I trust I have never seemed to fail in due respect.”"
"“我对此深信不疑，戴维先生。”她说，“特别幸运的是，你的尊重，不论是对你自己还是对你的穷邻居们，一直都是别人学都学不来的。不过先把这个问题搁一搁。你从我这里收到过一封短信？”她问。","“I will be your surety, Mr, David,” said she.“Your respect, whether to yourself or your poor neighbours, has been always and most fortunately beyond imitation.But that is by the question.You got a note from me?” she asked."
"“我曾斗胆作出这种推测，”我说，“而且认为这封短信是出于善意的。”","“I was so bold as to suppose so upon inference,” said I, “and it was kindly thought upon.”"
"“那一定让你大吃了一惊吧。”她说，“不过让我们从头开始说吧。你也许还没有忘记有一天你好心护送三位乏味的女士去霍普公园吧？我自己就更没有理由忘记了，因为你特别乐于助人，给我介绍了一些拉丁文的文法规则，这件事让我记忆深刻，感激万分。”","“It must have prodigiously surprised you,” said she.“But let us begin with the beginning.You have not perhaps forgot a day when you were so kind as to escort three very tedious misses to Hope Park?I have the less cause to forget it myself, because you was so particular obliging as to introduce me to some of the principles of the Latin grammar, a thing which wrote itself profoundly on my gratitude.”"
"“我恐怕我太书呆子气了。”我说，记忆一片混乱，“你应该要想到我不太善于和女士们打交道。”","“I fear I was sadly pedantical,” said I, overcome with confusion at the memory.“You are only to consider I am quite unused with the society of ladies.”"
"“那我就少谈点儿文法吧。”她回答说，“但是你怎么会逃避你的责任？‘他把她赶了出去，赶下了船，他那亲爱的安妮！’”她哼唱道，“他亲爱的安妮和她的两个妹妹只好自己摸索着回家，就像一队刚出壳的幼鹅那样！好像你回到了我爸爸那里，在那里你表现得威武异常，然后你又去了一些不知名的地方，关注的（看样子）只是那巴斯巨岩，也许心里想的是塘鹅而不是美丽的姑娘。”","“I will say the less about the grammar then,” she replied.“But how came you to desert your charge?‘He has thrown her out, overboard, his ain dear Annie!’” she hummed; “and his ain dear Annie and her two sisters had to taigle home by theirselves like a string of green geese!It seems you returned to my papa’s, where you showed yourself excessively martial, and then on to realms unknown, with an eye (it appears) to the Bass Rock; solan geese being perhaps more to your mind than bonny lasses.”"
"在哼唱这个打趣的段子时，那位小姐的眼神有些放纵，所以我想接下来谈的可能是好事。","Through all this raillery there was something indulgent in the lady’s eye which made me suppose there might be better coming."
"“你以折磨我为乐，”我说，“我都成一个任你摆布的玩物了。不过我要恳求你大发慈悲。现在，我想听的只有一件事情，那就是关于卡特里奥娜的消息。”","“You take a pleasure to torment me,” said I, “and I make a very feckless plaything; but let me ask you to be more merciful.At this time there is but the one thing that I care to hear of, and that will be news of Catriona.”"
"“鲍尔弗先生，你当着她的面也是这么称呼她的吗？”她问。","“Do you call her by that name to her face, Mr. Balfour?” she asked."
"“说实话，我不是很肯定。”我结结巴巴地说。","“In troth, and I am not very sure,” I stammered."
"“无论如何我对陌生人是不会这么称呼的。”格兰特小姐说，“那你为什么对这位年轻女士的事情这么关心呢？”","“I would not do so in any case to strangers,” said Miss Grant.“And why are you so much immersed in the affairs of this young lady?”"
"“我听说她被关进监狱了。”我说。","“I heard she was in prison,” said I."
"“嗯，那么现在你听说她已经出狱了，”她回答道，“那你还有什么好关心的？她已经不再需要任何勇士来保护她了。”","“Well, and now you hear that she is out of it,” she replied, “and what more would you have?She has no need of any further champion.”"
"“可能是我特别需要她吧，小姐。”我说。","“I may have the greater need of her, ma’am,” said I."
"“嗨，这样说才对！”格兰特小姐说，“但是你好好看看我的脸，难道我不比她更漂亮吗？”","“Come, this is better!” says Miss Grant.“But look me fairly in the face; am I not bonnier than she?”"
"“我绝对不会否认这一点，”我说，“整个苏格兰都没有人能和你媲美。”","“I would be the last to be denying it,” said I.“There is not your marrow in all Scotland.”"
"“嗯，现在你手上有两位可以选择，可你偏偏一定要去提另一个。”她说，“这绝不是取悦姑娘家的好办法啊，鲍尔弗先生。”“但是，小姐。”我说，“除美貌之外肯定还有其他的东西。”","“Well, here you have the pick of the two at your hand, and must needs speak of the other,” said she.“This is never the way to please the ladies, Mr. Balfour.”“But, mistress,” said I, “there are surely other things besides mere beauty.”"
"“照此说来，那我是不是该理解为我也许没有做到我应该做到的那么好呢？”她问。","“By which I am to understand that I am no better than I should be, perhaps?” she asked."
"“对此，请你这么理解，我就像是寓言书上垃圾堆里的一只大公鸡。”我说，“我看到了华丽的宝石——我也很想看到它——不过我更需要的却是那颗小小的谷粒。”","“By which you will please understand that I am like the cock in the midden in the fable book,” said I.“I see the braw jewel—and I like fine to see it too—but I have more need of the pickle corn.”"
"“太棒了！”她叫道，“最后这句话说得真好，为此我要讲个故事来奖赏你。就在你跑了的那天晚上，我很晚才从一个朋友家回来——在那里我感到受宠若惊，无论如何你都想不到——我居然听说有一位穿格子裙的少女渴望和我谈一谈。她在那里已经等了一个多小时，女仆这么告诉我，还说她坐在那里等的时候在暗自垂泪。 我径直朝她走了过去，我进去时她站了起来，而我一眼就认出了她。‘灰眼睛！’我对自己说，不过还算聪明没有喊出声。‘你就是格兰特小姐？我终于见到你了。’她说着，站起了身，眼睛紧紧盯着我看，一副楚楚可怜的样子。‘唉，真的是他说的那样，你真是漂亮。上帝居然让我以这样的方式见到你，亲爱的，’我说，‘不过，如果你能告诉我是什么事让你在晚上这个时候来这里找我的话，我会很高兴为你效劳的。’‘小姐，’她说，‘我们是亲戚，我们两个人都源自同样的血统，都是阿尔平的子孙。’‘亲爱的，’我回答说，‘我不关心阿尔平或者其子孙，我只关心家务琐事。你漂亮脸蛋上的这些泪水倒是更好的理由。’说到这里，我心肠一软就亲吻了她。这应该是你最想做的事，可我敢打赌你永远也不会有勇气去做。我说自己心肠软，是因为我只是看到她的外表，其实并不了解她，但是这一次却让我碰到了解她的最佳机会了。她本性非常坚定而勇敢，但是我觉得她很少得到温情，所以得到了那样的关爱（尽管说实话，只不过给予了一点点关爱）她的心扉就向我彻底敞开了。我永远也不会出卖我那位同性朋友的秘密，戴维先生，我永远也不会告诉你她是如何让我心甘情愿帮她的，因为她也会用同样的方法来掌控你的。唉，真是一位美丽的少女！ 她就像山泉水一样纯净。”","“Bravissimo!” she cried.“There is a word well said at last, and I will reward you for it with my story.That same night of your desertion I came late from a friend’s house—where I was excessively admired, whatever you may think of it—and what should I hear but that a lass in a tartan screen desired to speak with me?She had been there an hour or better, said the servant-lass, and she grat in to herself as she sat waiting.I went to her direct; she rose as I came in, and I knew her at a look.‘Grey Eyes!’ says I to myself, but was more wise than to let on.You will be Miss Grant at last? she says, rising and looking at me hard and pitiful.Ay, it was true he said, you are bonny at all events.—The way God made me, my dear, I said, but I would be gey and obliged if you could tell me what brought you here at such a time of the night.—Lady, she said, we are kinsfolk, we are both come of the blood of the sons of Alpin.—My dear, I replied, I think no more of Alpin or his sons than what I do of a kalestock.You have a better argument in these tears upon your bonny face.And at that I was so weak-minded as to kiss her, which is what you would like to do dearly, and I wager will never find the courage of.I say it was weak-minded of me, for I knew no more of her than the outside; but it was the wisest stroke I could have hit upon.She is a very staunch, brave nature, but I think she has been little used with tenderness; and at that caress (though to say the truth, it was but lightly given) her heart went out to me.I will never betray the secrets of my sex, Mr. Davie; I will never tell you the way she turned me round her thumb, because it is the same she will use to twist yourself.Ay, it is a fine lass!She is as clean as hill well water.”"
"“她一直就是这样的！”我叫道。","“She is e’en’t!” I cried."
"“好，然后，她就告诉了我她忧虑的事，”格兰特小姐继续说道，“她说到她爸爸时态度有多么犹豫，而说到你的时候她又有多么兴奋，哪怕是极小的事由。还有就是她发现在你走后她的心情有多么复杂。‘接着我就想了很久，’她说，‘想到我们是亲戚，还想到戴维先生曾把你称作是美人中最美的人，然后我就自己寻思着，如果她真有那么美丽，无论如何她的心地也应该善良，于是我就拔脚出发走到这里来了。’就是那一刻我原谅了你，戴维先生。在我的社交圈子里时，你就像坐在热熨斗上一样。从所有迹象来看，如果我曾发现有一个年轻人想逃离的话，那就是你了。我和我的两个妹妹就是你极力想逃避的女孩。不过现在看来你当时还是给予过我一些关注的，而且还曾那么善意地评论过我的美貌！从那一刻起你就记载下了我们的友谊，而我在学习拉丁文文法时也开始带着柔情来思考了。”","“Well, then, she told me her concerns,” pursued Miss Grant, “and in what a swither she was in about her papa, and what a taking about yourself, with very little cause, and in what a perplexity she had found herself after you was gone away.And then I minded at long last, says she, that we were kinswomen, and that Mr. David should have given you the name of the bonniest of the bonny, and I was thinking to myself ‘If she is so bonny she will be good at all events’; and I took up my foot soles out of that.That was when I forgave yourself, Mr. Davie.When you was in my society, you seemed upon hot iron: by all marks, if ever I saw a young man that wanted to be gone, it was yourself, and I and my two sisters were the ladies you were so desirous to be gone from; and now it appeared you had given me some notice in the by-going, and was so kind as to comment on my attractions!From that hour you may date our friendship, and I began to think with tenderness upon the Latin grammar.”"
"“想让我振作起来，你要花很多时间的。”我说，“我想那对你自己也不公平吧。我认为是卡特里奥娜使你转变了对我的看法。她太单纯了，所以看不出你为她的朋友所做的事情有多费劲。”","“You will have many hours to rally me in,” said I; “and I think besides you do yourself injustice.I think it was Catriona turned your heart in my direction.She is too simple to perceive as you do the stiffness of her friend.”"
"“我不愿在那上面打赌，戴维先生。”她说，“那女孩的眼睛很清澈。但至少她完全是你的朋友，这一点我看得出。我带她去了我爸爸那里，这位检察总长大人正好在享用红酒的兴头上，心情很好就接待了我们俩。‘这位是‘灰眼睛’，过去这几天您还没有听说过她。’我说，‘她来这里是为了证明我们说的是真话，我把这位在三个洛锡安地区都是最漂亮的姑娘留在您的脚下听您发落。’我给自己保留了赦免权。她是按照我的话去做的，举止得当。她向他行了屈膝礼——我敢发誓说他看出了她左右为难，这无疑使她的恳求越发难以拒绝，因为你们都是一群伊斯兰教徒——她告诉了他那天晚上的经历，她如何制止他父亲的手下跟踪你，她为她父亲所做的事情，以及为了你如何焦虑不安。她还一直哭泣着为保全你们两人的性命而求情（其实两个人都没有任何危险）。我发誓我为这位同性而自豪，因为这件事她处理得太好了，我为自己给她的机会太小而感到惭愧。她并没有说太多，我向你保证，随后检察总长完全冷静了下来，就注意到他内心深处的政见居然被一位年轻的少女一一道破，而且被他最任性的女儿给发现了。但是我们控制住了他，我们两个人，于是就把那件事情顺利摆平了。处理得当——是指由我来处理——没有人能和我爸爸相比的。”","“I would not like to wager upon that, Mr. David,” said she.“The lasses have clear eyes.But at least she is your friend entirely, as I was to see.I carried her in to his lordship my papa; and his Advocacy being in a favourable stage of claret, was so good as to receive the pair of us.Here is Grey Eyes that you have been deaved with these days past, said I, she is come to prove that we spoke true, and I lay the prettiest lass in the three Lothians at your feet—making a papistical reservation of myself.She suited her action to my words: down she went upon her knees to him—I would not like to swear but he saw two of her, which doubtless made her appeal the more irresistible, for you are all a pack of Mahomedans—told him what had passed that night, and how she had withheld her father’s man from following of you, and what a case she was in about her father, and what a flutter for yourself; and begged with weeping for the lives of both of you (neither of which was in the slightest danger), till I vow I was proud of my sex because it was done so pretty, and ashamed for it because of the smallness of the occasion.She had not gone far, I assure you, before the Advocate was wholly sober, to see his inmost politics ravelled out by a young lass and discovered to the most unruly of his daughters.But we took him in hand, the pair of us, and brought that matter straight.Properly managed—and that means managed by me—there is no one to compare with my papa.”"
"“对我来说他是个好人。”我说。","“He has been a good man to me,” said I."
"“那么，对凯特琳来说他也是个好人，当时我在那里就注意到这一点了。”她说。","“Well, he was a good man to Katrine, and I was there to see to it,” said she."
"“她替我求了情？”我说。","“And she pled for me?” say I."
"“她为你求情，而且非常感人。”格兰特小姐说，“我不想告诉你她说了什么——我发现你真是蠢到家了。”","“She did that, and very movingly,” said Miss Grant.“I would not like to tell you what she said—I find you vain enough already.”"
"“上帝会补偿她的！”我叫道。","“God reward her for it!” cried I."
"“我想是用戴维·鲍尔弗先生来补偿吧？”她说。","“With Mr. David Balfour, I suppose?” says she."
"“你对我也太不公平了！”我叫喊道，“一想到她在这么艰难的处境里我就浑身颤栗。你以为因为她替我求了情，我就会那么去想？她为一只刚出生的小狗都会那么做的。如果你有所了解的话，我不只是因为她那么做才振作起来的。她亲吻过我的那只手。啊，是真的。为什么？因为她认为我正在担当一个勇敢的角色，而且可能还会丢命。这不是因为我的缘故——但我不需要告诉你那一点，你不能总是看着我就觉得好笑。那是因为她爱她所认为的勇敢行为。我相信只有我和那可怜的查利王子才有幸能去做这些英勇之事。难道这不是把我看作神了吗？难道你不觉得每当我想起这一点我的心就会颤抖吗？”","“You do me too much injustice at the last!” I cried.“I would tremble to think of her in such hard hands.Do you think I would presume, because she begged my life?She would do that for a new whelped puppy!I have had more than that to set me up, if you but ken’d.She kissed that hand of mine.Ay, but she did.And why? because she thought I was playing a brave part and might be going to my death.It was not for my sake—but I need not be telling that to you, that cannot look at me without laughter.It was for the love of what she thought was bravery.I believe there is none but me and poor Prince Charlie had that honour done them.Was this not to make a god of me? and do you not think my heart would quake when I remember it?”"
"“我确实狠狠地嘲笑了你，而且非常没有礼貌地嘲笑了你。”她说，“但是我要告诉你一件事：如果你那样去跟她说话，你就会有那么一线机会。”","“I do laugh at you a good deal, and a good deal more than is quite civil,” said she; “but I will tell you one thing: if you speak to her like that, you have some glimmerings of a chance.”"
"“我？”我叫道，“我永远也不敢。我可以对你说，格兰特小姐，因为你怎么看我，我都无所谓的。但是对她？绝对不敢！”我说道。","“Me?”I cried, “I would never dare.I can speak to you, Miss Grant, because it’s a matter of indifference what ye think of me.But her? no fear!” said I."
"“我认为你有整个苏格兰最大的一对脚。”她说。","“I think you have the largest feet in all broad Scotland,” says she."
"“它们确实不算很小。”我低头看着脚说。","“Troth they are no very small,” said I, looking down."
"“啊，可怜的卡特里奥娜！”格兰特小姐叫道。","“Ah, poor Catriona!” cries Miss Grant."
"我只好呆呆地盯着她看，因为我虽然很清楚她有什么用意（也许是为同一件事在找理由），但是在这种无益的谈话中我从来都没有那么快就能够领悟。","And I could but stare upon her; for though I now see very well what she was driving at (and perhaps some justification for the same), I was never swift at the uptake in such flimsy talk."
"“啊，好吧，戴维先生。”她说，“这强烈地违背了我的良心，不过我清楚我还是得当你的传声筒。她会得知你一听到她被关押的消息就径直为她赶了过来；她会得知你连歇口气吃顿饭都不愿意；她只会听到那些我们谈话中我认为适合她这种涉世未深的少女听的内容。相信我，那样的话，你就会得到比你自己照顾自己更好的招待，因为我会不遗余力地看牢那对大脚。”","“Ah well, Mr. David,” she said, “it goes sore against my conscience, but I see I shall have to be your speaking board.She shall know you came to her straight upon the news of her imprisonment; she shall know you would not pause to eat; and of our conversation she shall hear just so much as I think convenient for a maid of her age and inexperience.Believe me, you will be in that way much better served than you could serve yourself, for I will keep the big feet out of the platter.”"
"“那么，你知道她在哪里？”我惊叫道。","“You know where she is, then?” I exclaimed."
"“我知道，戴维先生，但绝不会告诉你。”她说。","“That I do, Mr. David, and will never tell,” said she."
"“为什么那样？”我问。","“Why that?” I asked."
"“嗯，”她说，“我是一位好朋友，这一点你很快就会发现。而在那些我成为其朋友的人中最重要的一位就是我爸爸了。我向你保证，不论是威逼还是感化，你都绝不可能改变那一点，所以你就别再含情脉脉地看着我了。现在就跟你的戴维·鲍尔弗身份说再会吧。”","“Well,” she said, “I am a good friend, as you will soon discover; and the chief of those that I am friend to is my papa.I assure you, you will never heat nor melt me out of that, so you may spare me your sheep’s eyes; and adieu to your David-Balfourship for the now.”"
"“可是还有一件事，”我叫道，“还有一件事必须得停止，否则不仅会毁了她，也会毁了我。”","“But there is yet one thing more,” I cried.“There is one thing that must be stopped, being mere ruin to herself, and to me too.”"
"“好吧，”她说，“简洁一点儿，我已经在你身上花了半天的时间了。”","“Well,” she said, “be brief; I have spent half the day on you already.”"
"“那位阿勒代斯夫人认为，”我开始说道，“她想——她觉得是我绑架了她。”","“My Lady Allardyce believes,” I began—“she supposes—she thinks that I abducted her.”"
"一片红晕飞上格兰特小姐的脸庞，于是我第一次发现她的耳朵很精巧，为此我感到局促不安。后来我才想起她是在竭力憋住不笑出来，这一点从她随后答话时颤抖的声音中得到了证实。","The colour came into Miss Grant’s face, so that at first I was quite abashed to find her ear so delicate, till I bethought me she was struggling rather with mirth, a notion in which I was altogether confirmed by the shaking of her voice as she replied—"
"“我会维护你的名誉的，”她说，“你可以把这件事交给我。”","“I will take up the defence of your reputation,” she said.“You may leave it in my hands.”"
"说完这话她就离开了书房。","And with that she withdrew out of the library."
"第二十章 我继续跻身上流社会","CHAPTER XX—I CONTINUE TO MOVE IN GOOD SOCIETY"
"我在普雷斯顿格兰奇家中做了大约两个月的客，在那里我和爱丁堡的法院、律师界以及社交界的精英们更加熟悉了。你不要以为我把自己的教育给忽视了，相反，我忙得不亦乐乎。我学习法语，好为去莱登做更充分的准备；我埋头习剑，勤学苦练，有时一天练三个小时，进步显著；我堂兄皮尔里格是一位天资聪颖的音乐家，听从他的建议，我参加了歌唱班；遵照格兰特小姐的命令，我还参加了舞蹈班，对此我不得不承认我的舞蹈根本就看不得。然而，可以说所做的这一切都很有用，使我的谈吐更加文雅了。毋庸置疑，我学会了更精致地着装打扮，对剑术也更加熟练了，我还学会了站在任何房间里都很从容自如，好像自己就是主人一样。我的衣服全部都精心地重新定做了。就连最小的细节，如头发的梳理，或者缎带的颜色，都像是一桩大事一般让那三位小姐争论不休。通过种种努力，毫无疑问我的样子看起来已经有了很大的改观，颇有一点儿谦逊的风度，这肯定会让埃森迪恩的乡亲们大吃一惊的。","For about exactly two months I remained a guest in Prestongrange’s family, where I bettered my acquaintance with the bench, the bar, and the flower of Edinburgh company.You are not to suppose my education was neglected; on the contrary, I was kept extremely busy.I studied the French, so as to be more prepared to go to Leyden; I set myself to the fencing, and wrought hard, sometimes three hours in the day, with notable advancement; at the suggestion of my cousin, Pilrig, who was an apt musician, I was put to a singing class; and by the orders of my Miss Grant, to one for the dancing, at which I must say I proved far from ornamental.However, all were good enough to say it gave me an address a little more genteel; and there is no question but I learned to manage my coat skirts and sword with more dexterity, and to stand in a room as though the same belonged to me.My clothes themselves were all earnestly re-ordered; and the most trifling circumstance, such as where I should tie my hair, or the colour of my ribbon, debated among the three misses like a thing of weight.One way with another, no doubt I was a good deal improved to look at, and acquired a bit of modest air that would have surprised the good folks at Essendean."
"那两位年轻一些的小姐总是对我的服饰津津乐道，因为那正是她们一门心思关心的话题。我可以说其他任何方面都看不出她们会意识到我的存在。我对她们总是礼貌有加，虽然有点儿敷衍也还热诚，可是这些都无法掩饰我对她们的厌倦。至于说那位姑妈，她是一位安静得出奇的女人，我觉得她给予我的关注和对家庭的其他成员一样，都少得可怜。这样一来，那位大小姐和检察总长大人就是我的主要朋友了。我们有着相同的乐趣，所以我们之间的亲密关系增进得很快。开庭之前，我们在农庄呆了一两天，在那里有佳肴美酒，我们过着贵族般的生活。我们三个人还一起在田野上策马奔驰，这个习惯一直保留到了回爱丁堡之后，只要检察总长大人繁忙的公务中能抽出闲暇，我们就会去骑马。我们兴致勃勃运动的时候，心情都很好，所以道路的艰难、偶尔的天气恶劣、我的害羞拘谨等统统都消失得无影无踪了。我们忘记了我们曾经是陌生人，也不再是无话找话，说起话来更加自然随意。就那样他们从我这里一点一点地知道了我的故事。从我离开埃森迪恩那时起，到我的海上航行，“契约”号上的战斗，石楠丛里的逃亡等等。他们从我的历险中发现了乐趣，所以就冒出了稍后休庭的某一天我们所进行的一次远足之举，对于那次远足我会详细地讲一些琐碎的趣事。","The two younger misses were very willing to discuss a point of my habiliment, because that was in the line of their chief thoughts.I cannot say that they appeared any other way conscious of my presence; and though always more than civil, with a kind of heartless cordiality, could not hide how much I wearied them.As for the aunt, she was a wonderful still woman; and I think she gave me much the same attention as she gave the rest of the family, which was little enough.The eldest daughter and the Advocate himself were thus my principal friends, and our familiarity was much increased by a pleasure that we took in common.Before the court met we spent a day or two at the house of Grange, living very nobly with an open table, and here it was that we three began to ride out together in the fields, a practice afterwards maintained in Edinburgh, so far as the Advocate’s continual affairs permitted.When we were put in a good frame by the briskness of the exercise, the difficulties of the way, or the accidents of bad weather, my shyness wore entirely off; we forgot that we were strangers, and speech not being required, it flowed the more naturally on.Then it was that they had my story from me, bit by bit, from the time that I left Essendean, with my voyage and battle in the Covenant, wanderings in the heather, etc.; and from the interest they found in my adventures sprung the circumstance of a jaunt we made a little later on, on a day when the courts were not sitting, and of which I will tell a trifle more at length."
"我们清早就骑上马，先是经过了肖斯家的住宅，因为还是清晨，房屋还没有升起炊烟，而是笼罩在一大片白霜里。普雷斯顿格兰奇在这里下了马，把马交给我，然后独自一人去看望我的叔父。我记得，一看到那幢光秃秃的房子，再想到那个老守财奴瑟瑟发抖地坐在冰冷的厨房里时，我的内心涌上一阵苦涩。","We took horse early, and passed first by the house of Shaws, where it stood smokeless in a great field of white frost, for it was yet early in the day.Here Prestongrange alighted down, gave me his horse, an proceeded alone to visit my uncle.My heart, I remember, swelled up bitter within me at the sight of that bare house and the thought of the old miser sitting chittering within in the cold kitchen!"
"“这里有我的家，”我说，“还有我的家人。”","“There is my home,” said I; “and my family.”"
"“可怜的戴维·鲍尔弗！”格兰特小姐说。","“Poor David Balfour!” said Miss Grant."
"我从没听他说起过那次看望中所发生的事情，但毫无疑问那是一件让埃比尼泽不太高兴的事，因为检察总长再出来的时候，他的脸色铁青。","What passed during the visit I have never heard; but it would doubtless not be very agreeable to Ebenezer, for when the Advocate came forth again his face was dark."
"“我想你很快就会成为真正的领主了，戴维先生。”他一只脚踏在马镫上半转着身对我说道。","“I think you will soon be the laird indeed, Mr. Davie,” says he, turning half about with the one foot in the stirrup."
"“我永远不会假装悲伤。”我说。说实话，在他离开的那段时间，我和格兰特小姐已经在想象着如何种植园林、开辟花圃，以及修整一个露台来布置这个地方了——事实上，很多都是我现在已经付诸现实的。","“I will never pretend sorrow,” said I; and, to say the truth, during his absence Miss Grant and I had been embellishing the place in fancy with plantations, parterres, and a terrace—much as I have since carried out in fact."
"随后我们前行到了昆斯费里，在那里兰基勒热情地接待了我们，他的确使出了浑身解数来接待到访的这么一位大人物。检察总长在这里是如此地真诚自然、平易近人，他在全心全意考虑我的事情。他和那位律师在书房大约坐了两个小时，表达了（我后来得知）对我的极度尊重和对我个人财产的关注。而在这段时间，我、格兰特小姐还有小兰基勒则乘船渡过霍普河去了莱姆基恩斯。兰基勒对这位年轻女士钦慕不已，所以表现得很可笑（我觉得甚至有点令人讨厌），而让我感到惊讶的是（这只不过是女性的通病），她反而对此似乎还有点儿高兴。这样有一个用处：在我们到达彼岸时，她就指挥他留心看管船，而她和我则走向了岸边稍远处的小酒馆。这是她自己的想法，因为之前她听我说过艾莉森·黑斯蒂，就想亲眼见见这位少女。我们发现她又是独自一人在家——确实，我相信她父亲整日在田间劳作——她对我这个贵族摸样的人物和身穿骑士服的漂亮的年轻小姐恭恭敬敬行了屈膝礼。","Thence we pushed to the Queensferry, where Rankeillor gave us a good welcome, being indeed out of the body to receive so great a visitor.Here the Advocate was so unaffectedly good as to go quite fully over my affairs, sitting perhaps two hours with the Writer in his study, and expressing (I was told) a great esteem for myself and concern for my fortunes.To while this time, Miss Grant and I and young Rankeillor took boat and passed the Hope to Limekilns.Rankeillor made himself very ridiculous (and, I thought, offensive) with his admiration for the young lady, and to my wonder (only it is so common a weakness of her sex) she seemed, if anything, to be a little gratified.One use it had: for when we were come to the other side, she laid her commands on him to mind the boat, while she and I passed a little further to the alehouse.This was her own thought, for she had been taken with my account of Alison Hastie, and desired to see the lass herself.We found her once more alone—indeed, I believe her father wrought all day in the fields—and she curtsied dutifully to the gentry-folk and the beautiful young lady in the riding-coat."
"“我应该受到的欢迎就是这样的吗？”我说，并伸出手，“你一点儿都不记得老朋友了吗？”","“Is this all the welcome I am to get?” said I, holding out my hand.“And have you no more memory of old friends?”"
"“让我想想！这到底是怎么回事啊？”她叫道，接着说，“千真万确，这就是那个穿破烂衣裳的小伙子嘛！”","“Keep me! wha’s this of it?” she cried, and then, “God’s truth, it’s the tautit(1) laddie!”"
"“正是同一个人。”我说。","“The very same,” says"
"“很多时候我都想起你和你的那位朋友，现在看到你衣着光鲜我真的好开心啊。”她叫喊道，“不过，我知道你曾派人带了丰盛的礼物来看我，对此我发自内心地对你表示感谢。”","“Mony’s the time I’ve thocht upon you and your freen, and blythe am I to see in your braws,”(2) she cried.“Though I kent ye were come to your ain folk by the grand present that ye sent me and that I thank ye for with a’ my heart.”"
"“喂，”格兰特小姐对我说，“你自己先出去吧，要像个懂事的孩子。我来这里可不是为了站在一边举蜡烛的，我和她要好好聊一聊。”","“There,” said Miss Grant to me, “run out by with ye, like a guid bairn.I didnae come here to stand and haud a candle; it’s her and me that are to crack.”"
"我估摸着她在房里呆了十分钟，不过当她走出来时，我注意到两件事——一是她的眼睛红红的，还有就是她胸前别的银色胸针不见了。这使我颇受触动。","I suppose she stayed ten minutes in the house, but when she came forth I observed two things—that her eyes were reddened, and a silver brooch was gone out of her bosom.This very much affected me."
"“我从没见你打扮得这么漂亮过。”我说。","“I never saw you so well adorned,” said I."
"“哦，戴维你这家伙，不要当夸夸其谈的呆子!”她说，而且那天余下的时间她对我都要比平时尖刻一些。","“O Davie man, dinna be a pompous gowk!” said she, and was more than usually sharp to me the remainder of the day."
"大约掌灯时分我们结束远足回到了家。","About candlelight we came home from this excursion."
"有好一阵子我都没有听到卡特里奥娜进一步的消息了——我的格兰特小姐还是那么令人难以捉摸，总是用开玩笑来阻止我开口相问。终于，有一天我觉得她的眼神有点儿不同寻常。那天她散步回来，发现我独自在客厅里复习法语。她脸泛红晕、眼睛闪闪发亮，看着我的时候，脸上时不时闪现出一丝微笑。她看起来确实像那种搞恶作剧劲头十足的样子，脚步轻快地在房间里走来走去，很快就害我烦得没事都想找架吵了，（至少）在我这边是没有什么事情的。我就像那深陷泥沼的人一样——越是费力想爬到边上来，就陷得越深。直到最后我听到她满怀激情地宣布，她将会凭空变出个答案给我，但我必须下跪求她。","For a good while I heard nothing further of Catriona—my Miss Grant remaining quite impenetrable, and stopping my mouth with pleasantries.At last, one day that she returned from walking and found me alone in the parlour over my French, I thought there was something unusual in her looks; the colour heightened, the eyes sparkling high, and a bit of a smile continually bitten in as she regarded me.She seemed indeed like the very spirit of mischief, and, walking briskly in the room, had soon involved me in a kind of quarrel over nothing and (at the least) with nothing intended on my side.I was like Christian in the slough—the more I tried to clamber out upon the side, the deeper I became involved; until at last I heard her declare, with a great deal of passion, that she would take that answer from the hands of none, and I must down upon my knees for pardon."
"这样没来由的趾高气扬激起了我的怒火。“我没有说过一句你认为不妥而反对的话。”我说，“至于说要我下跪，我只有对上帝才会那么做。”","The causelessness of all this fuff stirred my own bile.“I have said nothing you can properly object to,” said I, “and as for my knees, that is an attitude I keep for God.”"
"“我就要像女神那样被伺候！”她叫道，一副欢快的样子，对我晃动着她褐色的卷发，“在我能影响的范围内，每一个人都要这样对我！”","“And as a goddess I am to be served!” she cried, shaking her brown locks at me and with a bright colour.“Every man that comes within waft of my petticoats shall use me so!”"
"“看在都这么做的份上，我只好说请你原谅，尽管我发誓我不知道那是为什么。”我回答道，“但是至于摆这些闹着玩的姿势，你可以去找别人做。”","“I will go so far as ask your pardon for the fashion’s sake, although I vow I know not why,” I replied.“But for these play-acting postures, you can go to others.”"
"“哦，戴维！”她说，“要是我求你也不行吗？”","“O Davie!” she said.“Not if I was to beg you?”"
"我想起自己是在和一个女子斗嘴，而且可以说她就是个孩子，我那么坚持就显得过于较真了。","I bethought me I was fighting with a woman, which is the same as to say a child, and that upon a point entirely formal."
"“我觉得这是小孩子干的事，”我说，“不值得让你求我，或者让我服从。不过我也不会拒绝你。”我说，“一旦有任何不妥的话，那只能怪你自己。”说完这话我就跪了下去。","“I think it a bairnly thing,” I said, “not worthy in you to ask, or me to render.Yet I will not refuse you, neither,” said I; “and the stain, if there be any, rests with yourself.”And at that I kneeled fairly down."
"“在那边！”她叫道，“那里才是合适的位置，那是我刚才要你过去的位置。” 然后，她突然说：“拿着。”她扔给我一张折着的纸条，就笑着跑出房间了。","“There!” she cried.“There is the proper station, there is where I have been manoeuvring to bring you.”And then, suddenly, “Kep,” (3) said she, flung me a folded billet, and ran from the apartment laughing."
"纸条上既没有地址也没有日期。“亲爱的戴维先生，”开头写道，“我一直从我的堂姐格兰特小姐那里了解你的消息，每次听到我都很开心。我很好，住的地方不错，周围的人们都很好，但是却有必要完全保密，尽管我一直希望我们最终能再次相见。关于你所有的友情，我那可爱的堂姐都告诉我了，她爱着我们双方。她吩咐我给你写这封信，也已经看过这封信了。我想请你一切听从她的吩咐，好让你挚爱的朋友卡特里奥娜·麦格雷戈—德拉蒙德安心。附：难道你不去看看我的本家亲戚阿勒代斯吗？”","The billet had neither place nor date.“Dear Mr. David,” it began, “I get your news continually by my cousin, Miss Grant, and it is a pleisand hearing.I am very well, in a good place, among good folk, but necessitated to be quite private, though I am hoping that at long last we may meet again.All your friendships have been told me by my loving cousin, who loves us both.She bids me to send you this writing, and oversees the same.I will be asking you to do all her commands, and rest your affectionate friend, Catriona Macgregor-Drummond.P.S.—Will you not see my cousin, Allardyce?”"
"当我按照吩咐径直向迪安村边的那所房子走去时，（用战士的话说）我觉得自己丝毫没有在战斗中本应该有的那种勇敢无畏。但是那位老夫人现在完全变了，态度非常柔和。格兰特小姐到底用什么方法扭转了她的态度，这我就不得而知了。我确信，至少在这件事情上她不敢公开出面，因为她爸爸的名声会为此而大受牵连的。事实上，正是他说服卡特里奥娜离开，或者更确切地说，让她不要回她本家亲戚的家，并安排她和格雷戈里一家人住一起——那一家人都很正派，非常听从检察总长的安排。她可能对他们更放心，因为他们都是他自己家族的人。这些人让她秘密藏身直到时机成熟，关注并帮助她设法营救了她父亲。在她从监狱里被释放以后，同样又一次秘密地收留了她。普雷斯顿格兰奇就是这样掌握并运用其手腕的。关于他和詹姆斯·莫尔的女儿相识一事，他丝毫都没有透露口风。当然，关于那位可疑人物的脱逃也有过一些私下议论，但是政府表现出了严厉的回应：有一个狱卒受了鞭刑，那个卫兵队长（我可怜的朋友邓肯斯比）被撤了职，至于说卡特里奥娜，所有的人都很乐意对她的过错保持沉默。","I think it not the least brave of my campaigns (as the soldiers say) that I should have done as I was here bidden and gone forthright to the house by Dean.But the old lady was now entirely changed and supple as a glove.By what means Miss Grant had brought this round I could never guess; I am sure, at least, she dared not to appear openly in the affair, for her papa was compromised in it pretty deep.It was he, indeed, who had persuaded Catriona to leave, or rather, not to return, to her cousin’s, placing her instead with a family of Gregorys—decent people, quite at the Advocate’s disposition, and in whom she might have the more confidence because they were of his own clan and family.These kept her private till all was ripe, heated and helped her to attempt her father’s rescue, and after she was discharged from prison received her again into the same secrecy.Thus Prestongrange obtained and used his instrument; nor did there leak out the smallest word of his acquaintance with the daughter of James More.There was some whispering, of course, upon the escape of that discredited person; but the Government replied by a show of rigour, one of the cell porters was flogged, the lieutenant of the guard (my poor friend, Duncansby) was broken of his rank, and as for Catriona, all men were well enough pleased that her fault should be passed by in silence."
"我无法劝说格兰特小姐帮我带一封回信。“不，”我坚持的时候她就会说，“我将不遗余力地约束那对大脚。”这叫人更加难以忍受，因为我清楚她这个星期多次见过我的那位小朋友，而且只要（如她所说）我“表现好”的时候，她就会把我的消息告诉她。最后她对待我，就像她说的，很是任性妄为，而我觉得更像是在开善意的玩笑。对她喜欢的人而言，她的确是一位强悍、几乎是粗暴的朋友。她的朋友中最主要的是一位身体虚弱的年迈贵妇人。她双目失明，但诙谐风趣，她住在一块高地顶上的狭窄巷子里，她家的笼子里养了一窝红雀，家里也整天熙熙攘攘的尽是访客。格兰特小姐很喜欢带我去那里，然后以讲述我的种种不幸遭遇来取悦她的那位朋友。蒂比·拉姆齐小姐（那是她的名字）特别善良，给我讲了很多值得了解的有关苏格兰老一辈的人以及往事。照我说，离她卧室的窗户不到三英尺远就是那个狭小的胡同，从那扇加了栅栏的小窗户望进去都有可能看得清对面房子里的楼梯。","I could never induce Miss Grant to carry back an answer.“No,” she would say, when I persisted, “I am going to keep the big feet out of the platter.”This was the more hard to bear, as I was aware she saw my little friend many times in the week, and carried her my news whenever (as she said) I “had behaved myself.”At last she treated me to what she called an indulgence, and I thought rather more of a banter.She was certainly a strong, almost a violent, friend to all she liked, chief among whom was a certain frail old gentlewoman, very blind and very witty, who dwelt on the top of a tall land on a strait close, with a nest of linnets in a cage, and thronged all day with visitors.Miss Grant was very fond to carry me there and put me to entertain her friend with the narrative of my misfortunes: and Miss Tibbie Ramsay (that was her name) was particular kind, and told me a great deal that was worth knowledge of old folks and past affairs in Scotland.I should say that from her chamber window, and not three feet away, such is the straitness of that close, it was possible to look into a barred loophole lighting the stairway of the opposite house."
"就在这里，有一天格兰特小姐找了一个借口把我单独留下和拉姆齐小姐一起。我记得当时我觉得那位女士心不在焉的，像是心事重重的样子。我感觉颇不舒服，因为与平时相反，那扇窗户是敞开的，而那天又很冷。突然格兰特小姐的声音从远处传入我的耳际。","Here, upon some pretext, Miss Grant left me one day alone with Miss Ramsay.I mind I thought that lady inattentive and like one preoccupied.I was besides very uncomfortable, for the window, contrary to custom, was left open and the day was cold.All at once the voice of Miss Grant sounded in my ears as from a distance."
"“嗨，肖斯！”她叫道，“往窗户外面看呀，看看我给你带来了什么。”","“Here, Shaws!” she cried, “keek out of the window and see what I have broughten you.”"
"我觉得那是我所看到的最美的一幕了。小巷的天井完全在阴影里，人们可以看得清清楚楚，墙壁黑乎乎脏兮兮的，而从那扇装有栅栏的小窗户里我看见两张脸在冲着我微笑——是格兰特小姐和卡特里奥娜。","I think it was the prettiest sight that ever I beheld.The well of the close was all in clear shadow where a man could see distinctly, the walls very black and dingy; and there from the barred loophole I saw two faces smiling across at me—Miss Grant’s and Catriona’s."
"“嗨！”格兰特小姐说，“我想让她像那位莱姆基恩斯的姑娘一样看看你衣着光鲜的样子。我想让她看看我尽心尽力，认真调教，把你打造成什么样子了！”","“There!” says Miss Grant, “I wanted her to see you in your braws like the lass of Limekilns.I wanted her to see what I could make of you, when I buckled to the job in earnest!”"
"我这时才想起她那天对我的服饰是比平时格外讲究一些，我认为这种关心也同样表现在卡特里奥娜身上了。因为像格兰特小姐这么一位快乐而有品位的女士，当然对服饰情有独钟了。","It came in my mind that she had been more than common particular that day upon my dress; and I think that some of the same care had been bestowed upon Catriona.For so merry and sensible a lady, Miss Grant was certainly wonderful taken up with duds."
"“卡特里奥娜！”是我当时唯一能说出的话。","“Catriona!” was all I could get out."
"至于她，根本就一句话都没说，只是挥挥手对我笑了笑，然后突然又从那个小窗户消失了。","As for her, she said nothing in the world, but only waved her hand and smiled to me, and was suddenly carried away again from before the loophole."
"这一幕刚一消失，我就跑到房门处，却发现房门已经锁了，于是我只好又回到拉姆齐小姐那里，叫喊着要钥匙，但是那还不如对着城堡的岩石去喊叫呢。她已经传过话来，她说，我必须做个好小伙。即使不算是失礼，破门而出都是不可能的，而我也不可能从离地七层高的窗户跳过去。我只能伸长脖子往小巷那边看，看她们是不是会在楼梯上再次出现。没有什么可看的，只不过看到她俩的头顶，每人顶了一块绕着线轴的布带，像是一对针垫。卡特里奥娜没有抬头道别，当时被格兰特小姐阻止了（这是我后来听说的），她告诉她的同伴，从上面往下看实在没有什么好处。","That vision was no sooner lost than I ran to the house door, where I found I was locked in; thence back to Miss Ramsay, crying for the key, but might as well have cried upon the castle rock.She had passed her word, she said, and I must be a good lad.It was impossible to burst the door, even if it had been mannerly; it was impossible I should leap from the window, being seven storeys above ground.All I could do was to crane over the close and watch for their reappearance from the stair.It was little to see, being no more than the tops of their two heads each on a ridiculous bobbin of skirts, like to a pair of pincushions.Nor did Catriona so much as look up for a farewell; being prevented (as I heard afterwards) by Miss Grant, who told her folk were never seen to less advantage than from above downward."
"回家的路上，我一得到自由就责备格兰特小姐太残忍了。","On the way home, as soon as I was set free, I upbraided Miss Grant with her cruelty."
"“我很抱歉让你失望了。”她一本正经地说，“就我而言，我很开心了。你比我担心的要好一些，你看起来——如果没有让你变蠢的话——出现在窗口时，是个非常俊俏的小伙子。你要记住她看不到你的脚。”她带着安慰我的语气说道。","“I am sorry you was disappointed,” says she demurely.“For my part I was very pleased.You looked better than I dreaded; you looked—if it will not make you vain—a mighty pretty young man when you appeared in the window.You are to remember that she could not see your feet,” says she, with the manner of one reassuring me."
"“哦！”我叫道，“我的脚就由它们去吧——它们不会比我邻居的脚更大。”","“O!” cried I, “leave my feet be—they are no bigger than my neighbours’.”"
"“它们甚至比有些人的脚还要小一些。”她说，“可是就像希伯来人的先知一样，我这么说只是用来打比方。”","“They are even smaller than some,” said she, “but I speak in parables like a Hebrew prophet.”"
"“难怪他们有时是被石头砸死的！”我说，“但是，你这个讨厌的女孩，你怎么能那么做呢？你为什么要用这一瞬间的见面害得我干着急呢？” ","“I marvel little they were sometimes stoned!” says I.“But, you miserable girl, how could you do it?Why should you care to tantalise me with a moment?”"
"“爱情就像人一样，”她说，“它也需要某种食粮的。”","“Love is like folk,” says she; “it needs some kind of vivers.”(4)"
"“噢，芭芭拉，适当的时候让我见见她吧！”我恳求道，“你可以的——只要你想见就可以见她的，就给我半个小时的时间吧。”","“Oh, Barbara, let me see her properly!”I pleaded.“You can—you see her when you please; let me have half an hour.”"
"“是谁在安排这场浪漫情事！你！还是我？”她问。我继续列举种种理由强求她，还是败于她的杀手锏，就是我一说出卡特里奥娜的名字，她就模仿我的声音和腔调。就用这种办法，的确，在接下来的几天里她就把我牢牢地控制住了。","“Who is it that is managing this love affair!You!Or me?” she asked, and as I continued to press her with my instances, fell back upon a deadly expedient: that of imitating the tones of my voice when I called on Catriona by name; with which, indeed, she held me in subjection for some days to follow."
"关于请愿书，再没有听到任何消息，或许只是我没有听到吧。普雷斯顿格兰奇和那位法院院长大人再怎么对此事充耳不闻，可能也已经听说了（就我所知）。至少他们心知肚明——公众却还蒙在鼓里。过了一段时间，11月8号，在一场狂风暴雨中，可怜的格伦斯的詹姆斯按期在莱特莫被巴拉胡利什给绞死了。","There was never the least word heard of the memorial, or none by me.Prestongrange and his grace the Lord President may have heard of it (for what I know) on the deafest sides of their heads; they kept it to themselves, at least—the public was none the wiser; and in course of time, on November 8th, and in the midst of a prodigious storm of wind and rain, poor James of the Glens was duly hanged at Lettermore by Ballachulish."
"这就是我参与的政治活动最终的结果！在詹姆斯之前就有无辜的人被处死，同样还继续会有无辜的人被处死（尽管我们都明白），一直到最后的时刻。直到最后的时刻，年轻的人们（他们还没有对生活和人们的欺诈习以为常）就会像我一样奋起抗争，作出英勇的决定并冒着长期的危险。然而事件发展的进程却会把他们抛向一边，然后像行进中的军队那样继续前进。詹姆斯被绞死了，而我还住在普雷斯顿格兰奇家里，并对他给予我父爱般的关怀满怀感谢之心。詹姆斯被绞死了，你看呀！我在路上碰到西蒙先生时，还不得不像一个在老师面前很听话的小男孩那样对他脱帽致礼。詹姆斯被欺骗和暴力绞死了，但世界仍然在前进，没有丝毫的不同。那起可怕事件的始作俑者们在家里却都是正派、善良、值得尊敬的父亲，他们还到教堂去领圣餐呢！ ","So there was the final upshot of my politics!Innocent men have perished before James, and are like to keep on perishing (in spite of all our wisdom) till the end of time.And till the end of time young folk (who are not yet used with the duplicity of life and men) will struggle as I did, and make heroical resolves, and take long risks; and the course of events will push them upon the one side and go on like a marching army.James was hanged; and here was I dwelling in the house of Prestongrange, and grateful to him for his fatherly attention.He was hanged; and behold! when I met Mr. Simon in the causeway, I was fain to pull off my beaver to him like a good little boy before his dominie.He had been hanged by fraud and violence, and the world wagged along, and there was not a pennyweight of difference; and the villains of that horrid plot were decent, kind, respectable fathers of families, who went to kirk and took the sacrament!"
"但是我对他们称为政治的那套可憎的交易却有自己的看法——我从其背后看到的全都是尸骨和黑暗。我已经可以抵抗生活中的任何诱惑而绝不再参与其中了。我一心想走的就是一条平坦、宁静而自我独立的路。我可以保持头脑清醒，远离危险之路，让我的良心亦远离诱惑之途。因为，回顾往昔，毕竟看起来我没有做成什么大事，但是我却说尽了大话，摆足了架势，而结果却一事无成。","But I had had my view of that detestable business they call politics—I had seen it from behind, when it is all bones and blackness; and I was cured for life of any temptations to take part in it again.A plain, quiet, private path was that which I was ambitious to walk in, when I might keep my head out of the way of dangers and my conscience out of the road of temptation.For, upon a retrospect, it appeared I had not done so grandly, after all; but with the greatest possible amount of big speech and preparation, had accomplished nothing."
"广告上说当月的25号有一艘船从利斯港起航，而我突然获推荐可整理行装赴莱登去学习。当然，对普雷斯顿格兰奇我是无话可说的，因为我已经赖在他家里白吃白喝很长时间了。但是和他女儿在一起时我就更直白了，我为自己要被送到国外的命运而悲伤，并断然跟她说，除非她带我去向卡特里奥娜告别，否则我会在最后一刻拒绝出发。","The 25th of the same month a ship was advertised to sail from Leith; and I was suddenly recommended to make up my mails for Leyden.To Prestongrange I could, of course, say nothing; for I had already been a long while sorning on his house and table.But with his daughter I was more open, bewailing my fate that I should be sent out of the country, and assuring her, unless she should bring me to farewell with Catriona, I would refuse at the last hour."
"“难道我没有给过你我的忠告吗？”她问。","“Have I not given you my advice?” she asked."
"“我知道你给过忠告，”我说，“而且我也知道我亏欠你太多，所以我愿意服从你的命令。但你必须得承认，有时候你这个姑娘有点儿太无忧无虑了，所以让人难以完全信任。”","“I know you have,” said I, “and I know how much I am beholden to you already, and that I am bidden to obey your orders.But you must confess you are something too merry a lass at times to lippen(5) to entirely.”"
"“那么，我就告诉你吧，”她说，“你最迟上午九点钟上船，船要到中午一点钟才开，你就呆在船边。如果我派他们去了以后，你还是对我安排的告别方式不满意的话，你大可以再次上岸，自己去找凯特琳。”","“I will tell you, then,” said she.“Be you on board by nine o’clock forenoon; the ship does not sail before one; keep your boat alongside; and if you are not pleased with my farewells when I shall send them, you can come ashore again and seek Katrine for yourself.”"
"既然不能向她要求更多，我就不得不对此表示同意。","Since I could make no more of her, I was fain to be content with this."
"那天终于来临了，我和她即将分离。我们曾经非常亲密熟悉，我欠她良多。就像该如何给那些家仆打赏钱一样，我们会以什么方式告别也成了让我无法入睡的心事。我知道她认为我太羞涩畏缩，宁可希望让她去动脑筋出主意。此外，在表现了这么多的真挚友爱之后，而且（我相信）双方都感受到了，如果再那么拘谨就会显得太冷漠了。所以我鼓足勇气，准备好了要说的话，等到最后我们单独相处的机会，就非常大胆地提出了要向她致礼告别。","The day came round at last when she and I were to separate.We had been extremely intimate and familiar; I was much in her debt; and what way we were to part was a thing that put me from my sleep, like the vails I was to give to the domestic servants.I knew she considered me too backward, and rather desired to rise in her opinion on that head.Besides which, after so much affection shown and (I believe) felt upon both sides, it would have looked cold-like to be anyways stiff.Accordingly, I got my courage up and my words ready, and the last chance we were like to be alone, asked pretty boldly to be allowed to salute her in farewell."
"“真奇怪，你居然那么健忘，鲍尔弗先生。”她说，“我记不起我曾给过你任何权利来认定我们是熟人。”","“You forget yourself strangely, Mr. Balfour,” said she.“I cannot call to mind that I have given you any right to presume on our acquaintancy.”"
"我站在她面前就像一架停摆的钟，不知道该想什么，更不知道说什么好，这时她突然伸开双臂搂着我的脖子，带着这世上最良好的愿望亲吻了我。","I stood before her like a stopped clock, and knew not what to think, far less to say, when of a sudden she cast her arms about my neck and kissed me with the best will in the world."
"“你难道真是个独特的孩子？”她叫道，“你觉得我会让我们像陌生人那样告别吗？因为我对你的注意力从没保持到五分钟，你也不能认为我就不很喜欢你，其实我每次看你一眼的时候，我都充满着爱慕与欢笑！那么现在我就给你一个忠告来结束我对你的教导，过不了多久你就会用到的。","“You inimitable bairn?” she cried.“Did you think that I would let us part like strangers?Because I can never keep my gravity at you five minutes on end, you must not dream I do not love you very well: I am all love and laughter, every time I cast an eye on you!And now I will give you an advice to conclude your education, which you will have need of before it’s very long."
"绝不要向女人请求。她们注定要回答‘不’，上帝从来就没有制造过能够抵抗诱惑的女子。这可能是出于神对夏娃的诅咒：因为在魔鬼给她送苹果的时候，她没有说这个字，所以她的女儿们除了这个字就什么都不会说了。”","Never ask womenfolk.They’re bound to answer ‘No’; God never made the lass that could resist the temptation.It’s supposed by divines to be the curse of Eve: because she did not say it when the devil offered her the apple, her daughters can say nothing else.”"
"“那么我很快就要失去我的漂亮老师了。”我开始说。","“Since I am so soon to lose my bonny professor,” I began."
"“你这是献殷勤，的确。”她行着屈膝礼说。","“This is gallant, indeed,” says she curtseying."
"“我想提一个问题。”我继续说道，“我可以请求一位姑娘嫁给我吗？”","“I would put the one question,” I went on.“May I ask a lass to marry to me?”"
"“你认为没求就不可以娶她呀！”她问，“或者让她提出要嫁你？”","“You think you could not marry her without!” she asked.“Or else get her to offer?”"
"“你看你就是严肃不起来。”我说。","“You see you cannot be serious,” said I."
"“我在一件事上是很严肃的，戴维，”她说，“我永远都是你的朋友。”","“I shall be very serious in one thing, David,” said she: “I shall always be your friend.”"
"第二天早晨我去牵马时，那四位淑女都在我们曾经俯视过卡特里奥娜的那扇窗户边。我骑马离开时，她们全都高喊着再会并不断挥舞着手帕。我知道她们四个人中有一位是真心感到难过的，一想到那一点，想到三个月前我第一次是如何到这个大门口的，我的悲伤和感激的心情就交织在了一起。","As I got to my horse the next morning, the four ladies were all at that same window whence we had once looked down on Catriona, and all cried farewell and waved their pocket napkins as I rode away.One out of the four I knew was truly sorry; and at the thought of that, and how I had come to the door three months ago for the first time, sorrow and gratitude made a confusion in my mind."

"第二十一章 驶入荷兰的航程","CHAPTER XXI—THE VOYAGE INTO HOLLAND"
"那艘轮船是抛单锚的，完全泊在利斯港码头的外面，所以我们所有的乘客都必须乘小船才能登上轮船。这实在是有点儿麻烦，因为那天虽然风平浪静，但很寒冷，而且天阴沉沉的，水面上低低地笼罩着一层飘忽不定的浓雾。当我向轮船靠近时，船身几乎都隐藏在浓雾中，只有船上的桅杆高高耸立，在阳光下闪闪发亮，就像闪烁的火光。原来这是一艘非常宽敞的商船，但是船身有点儿笨拙，因为要运往荷兰的食盐、盐腌鲑鱼和精美的白色亚麻长袜把船舱给装得特别满。我一上船，船长就向我表示了欢迎——他是桑家的一员（我相信他来自莱斯马黑戈），一位非常热心友好、身着防水服的男子，但他当时正忙得不可开交。当时还没有其他的乘客出现，所以就任由我在甲板上四处走动，我一边观赏景致一边暗自思忖了很多，想着这种告别应该是按照对我的承诺安排的吧。","The ship lay at a single anchor, well outside the pier of Leith, so that all we passengers must come to it by the means of skiffs.This was very little troublesome, for the reason that the day was a flat calm, very frosty and cloudy, and with a low shifting fog upon the water.The body of the vessel was thus quite hid as I drew near, but the tall spars of her stood high and bright in a sunshine like the flickering of a fire.She proved to be a very roomy, commodious merchant, but somewhat blunt in the bows, and loaden extraordinary deep with salt, salted salmon, and fine white linen stockings for the Dutch.Upon my coming on board, the captain welcomed me—one Sang (out of Lesmahago, I believe), a very hearty, friendly tarpaulin of a man, but at the moment in rather of a bustle.There had no other of the passengers yet appeared, so that I was left to walk about upon the deck, viewing the prospect and wondering a good deal what these farewells should be which I was promised."
"整个爱丁堡和彭特兰山冈都在我的头顶上方闪耀着黑漆漆的光亮，但时不时地会被团团云雾所遮掩。在利斯港那边只可以看见烟囱顶，在水面上则海雾弥漫，什么也看不见。不久我听到浓雾中传来船桨划动的声音，不一会儿（仿佛是从炮火的烟雾中冲出来似地）一艘小船出现在眼前。船尾坐着一个表情肃穆的男人，为抵御严寒他全身裹得严严实实的，在他身边一个高挑、优美、柔弱的少女身影让我的心跳停止了。我刚调整好呼吸，准备去迎接她，她就登上了甲板。我微笑着以最优雅的风度向她鞠了个躬，和几个月前我初遇这位小姐时所鞠的躬相比，这次风度大胜往昔。无疑我们俩都变化很大：她似乎长高了，像一棵亭亭玉立的小树。她现在有种娇羞之态，这使她显得优雅得体，不禁令人更加仰慕，而且相当有女人味。再则，是同一位魔术师之手在对我们两个人施法，如果格兰特小姐能把其中之一变得风姿绰约，那么她就可以把我们俩都变得雍容华贵。","All Edinburgh and the Pentland Hills glinted above me in a kind of smuisty brightness, now and again overcome with blots of cloud; of Leith there was no more than the tops of chimneys visible, and on the face of the water, where the haar(1) lay, nothing at all.Out of this I was presently aware of a sound of oars pulling, and a little after (as if out of the smoke of a fire) a boat issued.There sat a grave man in the stern sheets, well muffled from the cold, and by his side a tall, pretty, tender figure of a maid that brought my heart to a stand.I had scarce the time to catch my breath in, and be ready to meet her, as she stepped upon the deck, smiling, and making my best bow, which was now vastly finer than some months before, when first I made it to her ladyship.No doubt we were both a good deal changed: she seemed to have shot up like a young, comely tree.She had now a kind of pretty backwardness that became her well as of one that regarded herself more highly and was fairly woman; and for another thing, the hand of the same magician had been at work upon the pair of us, and Miss Grant had made us both braw, if she could make but the one bonny."
"我们两个人不约而同发出了同样的喊声，所喊的话也大致相同，都认为对方是来问候道别的，可是跟着我们马上就意识到我们将一起乘船同行。","The same cry, in words not very different, came from both of us, that the other was come in compliment to say farewell, and then we perceived in a flash we were to ship together."
"“哦，为什么芭比居然没有告诉我！”她叫道，跟着就想起她曾得到的一封信，条件是等她上船以后才能打开。里面夹有一封写给我的短信，其内容如下：","“O, why will not Baby have been telling me!” she cried; and then remembered a letter she had been given, on the condition of not opening it till she was well on board.Within was an enclosure for myself, and ran thus:"
"“亲爱的戴维：你怎么看我的告别安排？你对那位和你结伴同行的乘客说了什么？你是吻了她，还是问了她？我要就此签名结束这封信了，但是那样会使我所提问题的意图让人起疑，其实就我自己而言，我已经知道答案了。所以就在这里给你一些善意的建议吧。不要太腼腆羞怯，不过看在上帝的份上也不要太莽撞。没有什么会对你有不好的影响了。我就是","“DEAR DAVIE,—What do you think of my farewell? and what do you say to your fellow passenger?Did you kiss, or did you ask?I was about to have signed here, but that would leave the purport of my question doubtful, and in my own case I ken the answer.So fill up here with good advice.Do not be too blate,(2) and for God’s sake do not try to be too forward; nothing acts you worse.I am"
"“你挚爱的朋友和老师，芭芭拉·格兰特。”","“Your affectionate friend and governess,BARBARA GRANT.”"
"我从笔记本上撕下一页纸，写了句回复和恭维的话，然后夹在卡特里奥娜的回信里，全部一起装进信封，并盖上我那带有鲍尔弗家族徽章的新印章，最后亲手交到普雷斯顿格兰奇的家仆手里，他还在小船上等候回复。","I wrote a word of answer and compliment on a leaf out of my pocketbook, put it in with another scratch from Catriona, sealed the whole with my new signet of the Balfour arms, and despatched it by the hand of Prestongrange’s servant that still waited in my boat."
"然后我们才有时间彼此细细端详，以前我们一刻都没有这么做过，（出于同样的感情冲动）我们再一次握了手。","Then we had time to look upon each other more at leisure, which we had not done for a piece of a minute before (upon a common impulse) we shook hands again."
"“卡特里奥娜？”我说。这句话好像是我所说的第一句也是最后一句话。","“Catriona?” said I.It seemed that was the first and last word of my eloquence."
"“再次看到我，你高兴吗？”她说。","“You will be glad to see me again?” says she."
"“我想那是一句没有意义的话，”我说，“我们是友情深厚的朋友，没必要说这样的客套话。”","“And I think that is an idle word,” said I.“We are too deep friends to make speech upon such trifles.”"
"“她难道不是整个世上难得的好女孩吗？”她又喊道，“我从没结识过这么真诚而美丽的姑娘。”","“Is she not the girl of all the world?” she cried again.“I was never knowing such a girl so honest and so beautiful.”"
"“但是她只关心家庭琐事，又不关心你们阿尔平家族的大事。”我说。","“And yet she cared no more for Alpin than what she did for a kale-stock,” said I."
"“啊，她的确是这么说的！”卡特里奥娜喊道，“可是，正是因为那家族的名分和高贵善良的血统，她才会接受我并善待我的。”","“Ah, she will say so indeed!” cries Catriona.“Yet it was for the name and the gentle kind blood that she took me up and was so good to me.”"
"“那么，我来告诉你为什么如此吧。”我说，“在这世上，人们的面容是各种各样的。有芭芭拉这样的面容，每个人看了都会爱慕，认为她是一个漂亮、勇敢、快乐的姑娘。但也有你这样与众不同的面容——我到今天都没弄清到底怎么个不同法。你看不见你自己，所以你也不明白，但正是因为你长相可爱，她才接纳你并如此善待你的。而且世上的每一个人都会这么对你的。”","“Well, I will tell you why it was,” said I.“There are all sorts of people’s faces in this world.There is Barbara’s face, that everyone must look at and admire, and think her a fine, brave, merry girl.And then there is your face, which is quite different—I never knew how different till to-day.You cannot see yourself, and that is why you do not understand; but it was for the love of your face that she took you up and was so good to you.And everybody in the world would do the same.”"
"“每一个人？”她说。","“Everybody?” says she."
"“每一个活着的人！”我说。","“Every living soul?” said I."
"“啊，那么说，这就是城堡里的士兵要逮捕我的原因所在了！”她叫喊道。","“Ah, then, that will be why the soldiers at the castle took me up!” she cried,"
"“芭芭拉一直在教你怎么吸引我吧。”我说。","“Barbara has been teaching you to catch me,” said I."
"“不管怎么说，她要教会我的远不只是这些。她还会告诉我很多有关戴维先生的事情——他所有的坏毛病，还有一些他时不时会犯的不很严重的小毛病。”她微笑着说，“她将会告诉我所有关于戴维先生的事，就比如他居然正好和我乘坐同一条船。你为什么要走这一趟？”","“She will have taught me more than that at all events.She will have taught me a great deal about Mr. David—all the ill of him, and a little that was not so ill either, now and then,” she said, smiling.“She will have told me all there was of Mr. David, only just that he would sail upon this very same ship.And why it is you go?”"
"我告诉了她。","I told her."
"“啊，那好，”她说，“那我们可以结几天伴，然后（我猜想）就彻底告别！我要去一个名叫赫尔沃埃特的地方见我父亲，然后从那里去法国，和我们的族长一道去做流亡者。”","“Ah, well,” said she, “we will be some days in company and then (I suppose) good-bye for altogether!I go to meet my father at a place of the name of Helvoetsluys, and from there to France, to be exiles by the side of our chieftain.”"
"我只能说声“哦！”，詹姆斯·莫尔这个名字总是让我无话可说。","I could say no more than just “O!” the name of James More always drying up my very voice."
"她很快就注意到了这一点，并猜到了我的部分想法。","She was quick to perceive it, and to guess some portion of my thought."
"“戴维先生，有一件事情我得先说清楚。”她说，“我想我的两个亲戚不太对得起你。其中一个是我父亲詹姆斯·莫尔 ，而另一个则是普雷斯顿格兰奇领主。普雷斯顿格兰奇会亲自说，或者由他女儿代替他说。但是我父亲詹姆斯·莫尔，我就不得不多说几句了。他曾坐过牢上过拷，他是一个普通的、诚实的士兵，是一个普通的高地绅士。他永远都猜不出他们到底想从他身上寻找什么，但是如果他知道像你这样的年轻绅士居然都对他怀有某些偏见，他宁愿先死掉算了。看在你所有友情的份上，我请求你原谅我父亲和我的家族所犯的同样的错误。”","“There is one thing I must be saying first of all, Mr. David,” said she.“I think two of my kinsfolk have not behaved to you altogether very well.And the one of them two is James More, my father, and the other is the Laird of Prestongrange.Prestongrange will have spoken by himself, or his daughter in the place of him.But for James More, my father, I have this much to say: he lay shackled in a prison; he is a plain honest soldier and a plain Highland gentleman; what they would be after he would never be guessing; but if he had understood it was to be some prejudice to a young gentleman like yourself, he would have died first.And for the sake of all your friendships, I will be asking you to pardon my father and family for that same mistake.”"
"“卡特里奥娜，”我说，“我并不想知道他们犯了什么错误。我只知道一件事——你去过普雷斯顿格兰奇的家，而且屈膝求他饶我一命。哦，我清楚得很，你是为了你父亲才去的，但是你到那里以后也为我求了情。这件事情我不能再提起。有两件事情是我不能深思细想的：一件就是你称自己为我的小朋友时说的那些金玉良言，另外一件就是你为了救我的命曾去求过人。我们两个人永远都不要再说什么原谅或者冒犯之类的话了。”","“Catriona,” said I, “what that mistake was I do not care to know.I know but the one thing—that you went to Prestongrange and begged my life upon your knees.O, I ken well enough it was for your father that you went, but when you were there you pleaded for me also.It is a thing I cannot speak of.There are two things I cannot think of into myself: and the one is your good words when you called yourself my little friend, and the other that you pleaded for my life.Let us never speak more, we two, of pardon or offence.”"
"之后我们俩就默默地站着，卡特里奥娜看着甲板，而我则看着她。一阵微风从西北方吹了过来，他们那些船员开始扬帆起锚了。我们跟着又说了一会儿话。","We stood after that silent, Catriona looking on the deck and I on her; and before there was more speech, a little wind having sprung up in the nor’-west, they began to shake out the sails and heave in upon the anchor."
"除我们俩之外还有六名乘客，这样就把船舱给住满了。有从利斯、柯科迪、邓迪等地来的地地道道的商人，他们都在从事进入德国高原区的冒险行当。还有一位是返程的荷兰人，其余两位则是富商的妻子，其中有一位还是受推荐要照顾卡特里奥娜的。非常幸运的是格比夫人（这是她的名字）因为晕船晕得很厉害，只好日夜都躺在床上。在“玫瑰”号上有一个脸色苍白的男孩，他和我早先一样是餐桌侍者，除了他就只有我们俩是年轻人。所以几乎可以说完全就是我和卡特里奥娜在单独相处了。我们一起坐在桌子边相邻的两个座位，在此我格外开心地服侍着她。在甲板上，我用披风给她铺一块柔软的地方来坐。相对那样的季节来说，天气奇好，日日夜夜虽然寒冷却很晴朗，一股持续的和风吹拂，我们一路穿过北海，几乎没有一片云。从清晨出现太阳的第一缕霞光到晚上八、九点钟星光灿烂，我们一直坐在那里（只是偶尔为了取暖才来回走一走）。有时候那些商人或是桑船长会看我们一眼并对我们微笑，或者说一两句开心话，然后就又不再理会我们了。他们大部分的时间都在深切关注着鲱鱼、印花棉布和亚麻制品，要么就在计算行程太缓慢，只剩下我们在关心着自己的事，除我们自己外，这些事对任何人都无关紧要。","There were six passengers besides our two selves, which made of it a full cabin.Three were solid merchants out of Leith, Kirkcaldy, and Dundee, all engaged in the same adventure into High Germany.One was a Hollander returning; the rest worthy merchants’ wives, to the charge of one of whom Catriona was recommended.Mrs. Gebbie (for that was her name) was by great good fortune heavily incommoded by the sea, and lay day and night on the broad of her back.We were besides the only creatures at all young on board the Rose, except a white-faced boy that did my old duty to attend upon the table; and it came about that Catriona and I were left almost entirely to ourselves.We had the next seats together at the table, where I waited on her with extraordinary pleasure.On deck, I made her a soft place with my cloak; and the weather being singularly fine for that season, with bright frosty days and nights, a steady, gentle wind, and scarce a sheet started all the way through the North Sea, we sat there (only now and again walking to and fro for warmth) from the first blink of the sun till eight or nine at night under the clear stars.The merchants or Captain Sang would sometimes glance and smile upon us, or pass a merry word or two and give us the go-by again; but the most part of the time they were deep in herring and chintzes and linen, or in computations of the slowness of the passage, and left us to our own concerns, which were very little important to any but ourselves."
"起初我们有很多话要说，而且都认为自己非常诙谐，我想方设法成为她的护花使者，而她（我相信）也在竭力扮成一个有阅历的年轻淑女。但是很快我们彼此相处就更加随和了。我把那高雅、咬文嚼字的英语弃之一旁（其实已经所剩无几了），也把我那爱丁堡式的打躬作揖忘之脑后。她则侧身躺着，表现出一种友爱和亲密。我们朝夕相处，就像是一家人，只是（在我这边）情感更为深沉而已。大约是同时，我们的话匣子似乎见了底，不过我们丝毫都没有感到扫兴。有时候她会给我讲一些老掉牙的传奇故事，那些故事种类繁多，其中有很多是从我的朋友红发尼尔那里听来的。她讲起故事来娓娓动听，而且讲的那些孩子气的故事都很优美。不过对我而言，我的乐趣却在于聆听她的声音，而且一想到是她在讲我在听就感到其乐无穷。有时候，我们又会完全静默而坐，甚至连眼神都不交流一下，细细品味着那种毗邻而坐的甜蜜。我在这里只是谈谈自己的感受。至于那位少女的心里在想什么，虽然我曾问过自己但我心里没有底。而我自己的心里在想什么，我也不敢去深思。不论对自己还是对读者，我现在都没有必要再做任何隐瞒，我已经彻底地坠入爱河了。她来到我面前，挡住了太阳光。正如我所说，她突然长高了，不过成长得很健康。她显得健美而轻盈，而且勇敢无畏。我觉得她行走时犹如小鹿，站立时犹如傲立在山上的桦树。能和她并肩坐在甲板上，对我来说就已经足够了。我承认我几乎没有对未来多做思考，我非常满足自己目前所享受的一切，所以不想再费尽心力去设想下一步要怎么走。只是也许我有时候不免会想把她的手握在我的手心里，就那么握着。可是我就像一个吝啬鬼一样守护着自己拥有的快乐，不敢再冒险做任何事情。","At the first, we had a great deal to say, and thought ourselves pretty witty; and I was at a little pains to be the beau, and she (I believe) to play the young lady of experience.But soon we grew plainer with each other.I laid aside my high, clipped English (what little there was left of it) and forgot to make my Edinburgh bows and scrapes; she, upon her side, fell into a sort of kind familiarity; and we dwelt together like those of the same household, only (upon my side) with a more deep emotion.About the same time the bottom seemed to fall out of our conversation, and neither one of us the less pleased.Whiles she would tell me old wives’ tales, of which she had a wonderful variety, many of them from my friend red-headed Niel.She told them very pretty, and they were pretty enough childish tales; but the pleasure to myself was in the sound of her voice, and the thought that she was telling and I listening.Whiles, again, we would sit entirely silent, not communicating even with a look, and tasting pleasure enough in the sweetness of that neighbourhood.I speak here only for myself.Of what was in the maid’s mind, I am not very sure that ever I asked myself; and what was in my own, I was afraid to consider.I need make no secret of it now, either to myself or to the reader; I was fallen totally in love.She came between me and the sun.She had grown suddenly taller, as I say, but with a wholesome growth; she seemed all health, and lightness, and brave spirits; and I thought she walked like a young deer, and stood like a birch upon the mountains.It was enough for me to sit near by her on the deck; and I declare I scarce spent two thoughts upon the future, and was so well content with what I then enjoyed that I was never at the pains to imagine any further step; unless perhaps that I would be sometimes tempted to take her hand in mine and hold it there.But I was too like a miser of what joys I had, and would venture nothing on a hazard."
"我们所说的话通常是关于我们自己或者关于我们彼此之间的，所以要是有人费尽心机偷听我们的话，他肯定会认为我们是这世上最自恋的人。如果有朝一日要我们去做关于朋友和友情的演讲，我觉得我们现在的谈话就是在进行练习呢。我们谈到了友谊是多么美妙，我们对友谊的认识多么肤浅，友谊又如何让生活常新。我们还谈及了创世以来陷入同样困境的年轻人所谈论的成百上千件类似的事情。接着我们又谈到那种机缘真是奇妙，朋友从一开始就会走在一起，好像他们第一次见面就已经是朋友。然而每个人其实都已经和其他的人一起生活好久了。","What we spoke was usually of ourselves or of each other, so that if anyone had been at so much pains as overhear us, he must have supposed us the most egotistical persons in the world.It befell one day when we were at this practice, that we came on a discourse of friends and friendship, and I think now that we were sailing near the wind.We said what a fine thing friendship was, and how little we had guessed of it, and how it made life a new thing, and a thousand covered things of the same kind that will have been said, since the foundation of the world, by young folk in the same predicament.Then we remarked upon the strangeness of that circumstance, that friends came together in the beginning as if they were there for the first time, and yet each had been alive a good while, losing time with other people."
"“我说的还不算多呢，”她说，“我三言两语就能够把整件事情的十之八九讲给你。我只不过是一个女孩，不论怎么说吧，又会有什么样的事降临到一个女孩的身上呢？但是，1745年我就和部族的人一起行军了。男人们行军都时带着刀剑和火枪，队伍中有些人穿着同样的苏格兰格子裙。我跟你说，他们行军时可不是畏缩不前的。还有来自低地的绅士，带着佃农骑兵，吹着军号，还有战笛在尖声奏鸣。我骑着一匹高地小马，就在我父亲詹姆斯·莫尔和格伦盖尔的右手边。当时有一件事情我记忆犹新，就是格伦盖尔在我脸上亲吻了一下，因为（他说）‘我的亲侄女，你可是我们族突围出来的唯一女士啊’而我那时候可能还只是一个12岁的小女孩！我还看到了查利王子，看到了他那双蔚蓝的眼睛。他的确是英俊非凡！我在队伍的前面吻了他的手。哦，那段时光真美好，可是那一切就像是我的一场梦，跟着就梦醒了。事情的发展你都很清楚了。红衣士兵出击后的那段日子简直糟透了，我的父亲和叔伯们都呆在山里，而我则要在深更半夜，或者公鸡报晓时的短暂时刻给他们送去食物。是啊，很多时候我都是夜里赶路，我内心充满了对黑夜的恐惧。奇怪的是，我从来没有遇见过妖怪，不过据说少女是安全的。接下来就是我叔叔的婚事，不过那可是最令人郁闷的一件事了。那个女人的名字叫珍·凯。在因弗斯纳德的那天晚上，也就是我们遵循古老习俗把她从她的朋友那里抢过来的那天晚上，她让我在房间里陪她。不管她愿不愿意，她从嫁给罗布的那一刻起就注定了以后她会一无所有。我从没有见过这么无精打采的女人。确实，她完全就是这么一个女人，任人摆布。唉，她本来就是一个寡妇，而我一向都认为寡妇不是什么好女人。”","“It is not much that I have done,” said she, “and I could be telling you the five-fifths of it in two-three words.It is only a girl I am, and what can befall a girl, at all events?But I went with the clan in the year ’45.The men marched with swords and fire-locks, and some of them in brigades in the same set of tartan; they were not backward at the marching, I can tell you.And there were gentlemen from the Low Country, with their tenants mounted and trumpets to sound, and there was a grant skirling of war-pipes.I rode on a little Highland horse on the right hand of my father, James More, and of Glengyle himself.And here is one fine thing that I remember, that Glengyle kissed me in the face, because (says he) ‘my kinswoman, you are the only lady of the clan that has come out,’ and me a little maid of maybe twelve years old!I saw Prince Charlie too, and the blue eyes of him; he was pretty indeed!I had his hand to kiss in front of the army.O, well, these were the good days, but it is all like a dream that I have seen and then awakened.It went what way you very well know; and these were the worst days of all, when the red-coat soldiers were out, and my father and uncles lay in the hill, and I was to be carrying them their meat in the middle night, or at the short sight of day when the cocks crow.Yes, I have walked in the night, many’s the time, and my heart great in me for terror of the darkness.It is a strange thing I will never have been meddled with by a bogle; but they say a maid goes safe.Next there was my uncle’s marriage, and that was a dreadful affair beyond all.Jean Kay was that woman’s name; and she had me in the room with her that night at Inversnaid, the night we took her from her friends in the old, ancient manner.She would and she wouldn’t; she was for marrying Rob the one minute, and the next she would be for none of him.I will never have seen such a feckless creature of a woman; surely all there was of her would tell her ay or no.Well, she was a widow; and I can never be thinking a widow a good woman.”"
"“卡特里奥娜！”我说，“你怎么会那么想啊？”","“Catriona!” says I, “how do you make out that?”"
"“我不知道，”她说，“我只是告诉你我心里的感觉而已。她跟着就又另嫁他人！啐！但她就是那么个人。她再嫁时就嫁给了我的叔叔罗宾，有一阵子她跟着他去教堂、上市场，可后来她就感到厌倦了。或许是她的朋友取笑她并说服了她，或许是她觉得羞愧了。最后她就跑了，跑回自己的娘家去了，而且还说是我们从湖上把她给抢走的。我根本就不想告诉你这一切的。打那以后我就瞧不起任何女人了。就这样，到最后我的父亲詹姆斯·莫尔被投进了监狱，其余的事情你就知道得和我一样清楚了。”","“I do not know,” said she; “I am only telling you the seeming in my heart.And then to marry a new man!Fy!But that was her; and she was married again upon my Uncle Robin, and went with him awhile to kirk and market; and then wearied, or else her friends got claught of her and talked her round, or maybe she turned ashamed; at the least of it, she ran away, and went back to her own folk, and said we had held her in the lake, and I will never tell you all what.I have never thought much of any females since that day.And so in the end my father, James More, came to be cast in prison, and you know the rest of it an well as me.”"
"“而你始终都没有朋友吗？”我说。","“And through all you had no friends?” said I."
"“没有，”她说，“我最主要的伙伴就是住在山上的两三个女孩，但还不能称之为朋友。”","“No,” said she; “I have been pretty chief with two-three lasses on the braes, but not to call it friends.”"
"“哦，我的经历很平淡无奇。”我说，“在遇到你以前，我从来没有一个属于自己的朋友。”","“Well, mine is a plain tale,” said I.“I never had a friend to my name till I met in with you.”"
"“那么，那位勇敢的斯图尔特先生呢？”她问。","“And that brave Mr. Stewart?” she asked."
"“哦，是啊，我把他给忘记了，”我说，“但他是男子汉，那是截然不同的。”","“O, yes, I was forgetting him,” I said.“But he in a man, and that in very different.”"
"“我也这么认为。”她说，“哦，是啊，是大不相同。”","“I would think so,” said she.“O, yes, it is quite different.”"
"“然后另外还有一个，”我说，“我一度以为我有一个朋友，可是结果却让很我失望。”","“And then there was one other,” said I.“I once thought I had a friend, but it proved a disappointment.”"
"她问我那个女人是谁。","She asked me who she was?"
"“那是个男人。”我说，“我们俩是我父亲学校里最棒的两个男生，而且我们都认为彼此深深挚爱着对方。不过后来就到了分别的时候，他去了格拉斯哥的一家商行，那家商行是他的一位远房亲戚开的。他曾给我写过两三封信让邮差送来，后来他找到新的朋友了。我一直给他写信，直到我觉得倦了，可是他根本就未加理会。唉，卡特里奥娜，我过了很久才原谅了这个世界。没有什么事情比失去一个心仪的朋友更痛苦了。” ","“It was a he, then,” said I.“We were the two best lads at my father’s school, and we thought we loved each other dearly.Well, the time came when he went to Glasgow to a merchant’s house, that was his second cousin once removed; and wrote me two-three times by the carrier; and then he found new friends, and I might write till I was tired, he took no notice.Eh, Catriona, it took me a long while to forgive the world.There is not anything more bitter than to lose a fancied friend.”"
"于是她开始仔细询问他的长相和品性，因为我们两个人都非常关心令对方感动的所有事情。直到最后，在那倒霉的一刻，我想起了那位朋友写的信，就下到船舱取来了那捆信。","Then she began to question me close upon his looks and character, for we were each a great deal concerned in all that touched the other; till at last, in a very evil hour, I minded of his letters and went and fetched the bundle from the cabin."
"“这就是他的来信，”我说，“这是我收到的所有信件。这是我能告诉你的关于我自己的最后一件事，你也和我一样全都知道剩下的事情了。”","“Here are his letters,” said I, “and all the letters that ever I got.That will be the last I’ll can tell of myself; ye know the lave(3) as well as I do.”"
"“那么，你能让我看看这些信吗？”她说。","“Will you let me read them, then?” says she."
"我告诉她，如果她愿意费神的话，可以让我离开，那她就可以从头到尾去看这些信了。现在，在我给她的那捆信里，不仅有我那位没有信义的朋友的所有信件，还有一两封坎贝尔先生在镇上会堂里写给我的信。如果要罗列出所有写给我的信，那就还有卡特里奥娜的几句话以及我收到的格兰特小姐的两封信，一封是我在巴斯时收到的，还有一封是我上这艘船时收到的。但是当时我对这两封信的内容已经没有特别的印象了。","I told her, if she would be at the pains; and she bade me go away and she would read them from the one end to the other.Now, in this bundle that I gave her, there were packed together not only all the letters of my false friend, but one or two of Mr. Campbell’s when he was in town at the Assembly, and to make a complete roll of all that ever was written to me, Catriona’s little word, and the two I had received from Miss Grant, one when I was on the Bass and one on board that ship.But of these last I had no particular mind at the moment."
"我沉浸在挂念着我的朋友的状态中，无论我做什么，无论她是否在我的面前，都不会影响这种挂念。我迷恋着她，就像某种抑制不住的狂热在我胸膛里不停地燃烧，日日夜夜，无论我是醒着还是在睡梦中。就这样我来到船头，宽大的船首劈波斩浪，当时我并没有像你们想象得那样急着返回，而是在拖延时间，像是在享受别样的快乐。我并不认为我天生就是一个享乐主义者，可是既然让我遇上了那么一份小小的快乐，也许我可以借此好好沉醉于其中享受享受。","I was in that state of subjection to the thought of my friend that it mattered not what I did, nor scarce whether I was in her presence or out of it; I had caught her like some kind of a noble fever that lived continually in my bosom, by night and by day, and whether I was waking or asleep.So it befell that after I was come into the fore-part of the ship where the broad bows splashed into the billows, I was in no such hurry to return as you might fancy; rather prolonged my absence like a variety in pleasure.I do not think I am by nature much of an Epicurean: and there had come till then so small a share of pleasure in my way that I might be excused perhaps to dwell on it unduly."
"当我再次返回她身边时，她冷冷地把那捆信还给了我。这就如一瓢冷水迎头泼下，我几欲晕厥，痛苦不堪。","When I returned to her again, I had a faint, painful impression as of a buckle slipped, so coldly she returned the packet."
"“你看完这些信了？”我说。我觉得自己的声音听起来不是很自然，因为我满脑子在想着到底是什么惹她不高兴了。","“You have read them?” said I; and I thought my voice sounded not wholly natural, for I was turning in my mind for what could ail her."
"“你是说我全看完了吗？”她问。","“Did you mean me to read all?” she asked."
"我告诉她“是”，声音有气无力的。","I told her “Yes,” with a drooping voice."
"“也包括最后几封信吗？”她说。","“The last of them as well?” said she."
"我知道问题出在哪里了，可是我也不想对她撒谎。“我并不后悔把信都给了你，”我说，“因为我想到了你会看到这些信。我认为里面任何一封信都不会有什么伤害。”","I knew where we were now; yet I would not lie to her either.“I gave them all without afterthought,” I said, “as I supposed that you would read them.I see no harm in any.”"
"“给我的感受却不一样，”她说，“感谢上帝，给我的感受不一样。这封信不适合拿给我看。这封信根本就不该写出来。”","“I will be differently made,” said she.“I thank God I am differently made.It was not a fit letter to be shown me.It was not fit to be written.”"
"“我觉得你是在说你自己的朋友，芭芭拉·格兰特吧？”我说。","“I think you are speaking of your own friend, Barbara Grant?” said I."
"“没有什么事情会比失去一个心仪的朋友更痛苦了。”她说，引用了我自己才说过的话。","“There will not be anything as bitter as to lose a fancied friend,” said she, quoting my own expression."
"“我认为有时候友谊也是令人心仪的！”我叫道，“就因为一个轻率的傻女孩写在纸上的几句话，你就来责备我，你觉得这样做公平吗？你知道我有多尊重你——而且一直都会尊重你的。”","“I think it is sometimes the friendship that was fancied!” I cried.“What kind of justice do you call this, to blame me for some words that a tomfool of a madcap lass has written down upon a piece of paper?You know yourself with what respect I have behaved—and would do always.”"
"“可你居然给我看这封信！”她说，“我不想要这样的朋友。我可以过得很好，鲍尔弗先生，没有她——或者没有你都一样。”","“Yet you would show me that same letter!” says she.“I want no such friends.I can be doing very well, Mr. Balfour, without her—or you.”"
"“这就是你诚心的谢意！”我说。","“This is your fine gratitude!” says I."
"“我非常非常感谢你。”她说，“我求你把你的——信都拿走。”她说这话时声音好像有些哽咽，所以听起来就像是在发誓。","“I am very much obliged to you,” said she.“I will be asking you to take away your—letters.”She seemed to choke upon the word, so that it sounded like an oath."
"“你不用再要求第二次。”我说着，捡起那捆信，往前走了几步，然后就使劲把信尽可能远地扔到大海里去了。有那么一小会儿，我恨不得跟着把自己也给扔出去。","“You shall never ask twice,” said I; picked up that bundle, walked a little way forward and cast them as far as possible into the sea.For a very little more I could have cast myself after them."
"那天剩下的时间，我踱来踱去，大为恼火。太阳落山之前，我满脑子想的都是些最恶毒的骂她的话。与此相比，我过去听说的所有关于高地人的高傲之说似乎都大为逊色了。一个女孩（还没有完全成熟）居然对这么微小的暗示生那么大的气，何况那还是她的朋友呢，我稍加赞许，她就几近忍无可忍！就像愤怒中的男孩一样，我对她满怀怨恨、尖刻、刻薄等种种不满的想法。 要是我真的吻了她（我想），也许她倒欣然接受了。可是仅仅因为写的这封信有一点调侃的味道，她就勃然大怒，简直荒唐可笑。我似乎有种欲望想要看透女性的内心，好让天使也来垂怜垂怜我们这些可怜的男人。","The rest of the day I walked up and down raging.There were few names so ill but what I gave her them in my own mind before the sun went down.All that I had ever heard of Highland pride seemed quite outdone; that a girl (scarce grown) should resent so trifling an allusion, and that from her next friend, that she had near wearied me with praising of!I had bitter, sharp, hard thoughts of her, like an angry boy’s.If I had kissed her indeed (I thought), perhaps she would have taken it pretty well; and only because it had been written down, and with a spice of jocularity, up she must fuff in this ridiculous passion.It seemed to me there was a want of penetration in the female sex, to make angels weep over the case of the poor men."
"吃晚饭的时候我们又并排坐在一起了，可是却发生了多大的变化啊！她对着我就像凝固的牛奶，摆出木偶一样的脸。我本可以无情地打击她，或者干脆就拜伏在她的脚下，但是她根本就不给我一丝机会。她一吃完饭就去陪伴格比夫人，而我觉得此前她对这位夫人并不太在意。但是她有意要弥补失去的时间，所以她特别殷勤地陪着那位老妇人穿过走廊，而到甲板上以后她又开始和桑船长套近乎，对此我认为很不明智。尽管船长似乎是一位可敬、慈爱的男人，不过看见她和除我之外的任何人表现出丝毫的亲密，我都很反感。","We were side by side again at supper, and what a change was there!She was like curdled milk to me; her face was like a wooden doll’s; I could have indifferently smitten her or grovelled at her feet, but she gave me not the least occasion to do either.No sooner the meal done than she betook herself to attend on Mrs. Gebbie, which I think she had a little neglected heretofore.But she was to make up for lost time, and in what remained of the passage was extraordinary assiduous with the old lady, and on deck began to make a great deal more than I thought wise of Captain Sang.Not but what the Captain seemed a worthy, fatherly man; but I hated to behold her in the least familiarity with anyone except myself."
"总之，她非常迅速地避开我，一直置身于人群中，害得我观察了很久才找到机会。可是之后我却发现，我从中并没有得到便宜，这一点我现在就说给你们听。","Altogether, she was so quick to avoid me, and so constant to keep herself surrounded with others, that I must watch a long while before I could find my opportunity; and after it was found, I made not much of it, as you are now to hear."
"“我实在猜不出我怎么冒犯你了，”我说，“那应该不算是什么不能原谅的事情。哦，你就尽量原谅我吧。”","“I have no guess how I have offended,” said I; “it should scarce be beyond pardon, then.O, try if you can pardon me.”"
"“我没有什么可原谅的，”她说，这句话就像是从她喉咙里蹦出来的，冰冷无情，“对你的友情我还感激不尽呢。”然后她对我微微行了个屈膝礼。","“I have no pardon to give,” said she; and the words seemed to come out of her throat like marbles.“I will be very much obliged for all your friendships.”And she made me an eighth part of a curtsey."
"但是我事先已经准备好要对她多说一些话的，而且我也打算说出来了。","But I had schooled myself beforehand to say more, and I was going to say it too."
"“有一件事情，”我说，“如果是因为我给你看那封信而伤到了你的感情，那也不关格兰特小姐的事。她不是写给你的，而是写给一个可怜、普通、平凡的小伙子的。也许那个小伙子更理智一些的话，就不给你看那封信了。如果你要怪我的话——”","“There is one thing,” said I.“If I have shocked your particularity by the showing of that letter, it cannot touch Miss Grant.She wrote not to you, but to a poor, common, ordinary lad, who might have had more sense than show it.If you are to blame me—”"
"“我劝你不要再提那个女孩了，无论如何都不要再提了！”卡特里奥娜说道，“她呀，在马路上我瞧都不会瞧一眼，就算她躺在那里要死了，我都不会瞧她一眼。”她转身离开了我，而后突然又转回身来。“你能发誓你永远都不会和她再有任何关联吗？”她叫道。","“I will advise you to say no more about that girl, at all events!” said Catriona.“It is her I will never look the road of, not if she lay dying.”She turned away from me, and suddenly back.“Will you swear you will have no more to deal with her?” she cried."
"“确实，我绝不会那么不公平，”我说，“也绝不会那么忘恩负义。”","“Indeed, and I will never be so unjust then,” said I; “nor yet so ungrateful.”"
"这一次是我转身走开了。","And now it was I that turned away."
"第二十二章 赫尔沃埃特港","CHAPTER XXII—HELVOETSLUYS"
"最后天气变得相当恶劣了，风呼啸着从重重船桅索中穿过，海面波涛越涌越高，轮船开始在层层巨浪中艰难地行进，并发出吱吱嘎嘎的响声。这时测深员的探报声几乎没有停歇，因为我们一路都是在浅海中缓慢前进。大约早上九点钟，在两场冰雹的间隙，在一片突然而至的冬日阳光里，我第一次见到了荷兰——一排风车在微风中呼呼旋转着。我还是头一回见识这些好玩的新鲜装置，这给了我一种在异国旅行，见识新世界和新生活的感觉。我们大约十一点半停泊了下来，就在赫尔沃埃特港外面，那个地方有时海浪会猛袭过来，我们的船就会剧烈地摇晃颠簸。可以肯定，除格比夫人外，我们都登上了甲板。有些人穿着斗篷，有些人则披着船上的防水油布，所有的人都紧紧抓着绳索，竭力在模仿老水手，样子很是好笑。","The weather in the end considerably worsened; the wind sang in the shrouds, the sea swelled higher, and the ship began to labour and cry out among the billows.The song of the leadsman in the chains was now scarce ceasing, for we thrid all the way among shoals.About nine in the morning, in a burst of wintry sun between two squalls of hail, I had my first look of Holland—a line of windmills birling in the breeze.It was besides my first knowledge of these daft-like contrivances, which gave me a near sense of foreign travel and a new world and life.We came to an anchor about half-past eleven, outside the harbour of Helvoetsluys, in a place where the sea sometimes broke and the ship pitched outrageously.You may be sure we were all on deck save Mrs. Gebbie, some of us in cloaks, others mantled in the ship’s tarpaulins, all clinging on by ropes, and jesting the most like old sailor-folk that we could imitate."
"不久，一只样子很像欧洲黄道蟹的小船小心翼翼地从旁边靠了过来，那位船主用荷兰语和我们船长打了招呼。之后，桑船长很为难地转向卡特里奥娜，而我们其他人都拥在他们周围，情形之恶劣众人都非常清楚。“玫瑰”号是开往鹿特丹港的，其他乘客都迫不及待地想赶快到达目的地，以便赶乘当晚那班前往德国北部的航船。这时一阵狂风刮过来，船长（不失时机地）大声宣称他有能力挽回时间。按照先前的约定，现在詹姆斯·莫尔已经在赫尔沃埃特等他女儿了，而且船长曾受委托要在港口外停留，以便送他女儿（按照承诺）到岸边划来的小船上。诚然，如今小船已到，而这边卡特里奥娜也已经做好了准备，可是我们的船长和那小船的船主面对危险却都迟疑了起来，而当下首要的就是不能再耽搁时间了。","Presently a boat, that was backed like a partancrab, came gingerly alongside, and the skipper of it hailed our master in the Dutch.Thence Captain Sang turned, very troubled-like, to Catriona; and the rest of us crowding about, the nature of the difficulty was made plain to all.The Rose was bound to the port of Rotterdam, whither the other passengers were in a great impatience to arrive, in view of a conveyance due to leave that very evening in the direction of the Upper Germany.This, with the present half-gale of wind, the captain (if no time were lost) declared himself still capable to save.Now James More had trysted in Helvoet with his daughter, and the captain had engaged to call before the port and place her (according to the custom) in a shore boat.There was the boat, to be sure, and here was Catriona ready: but both our master and the patroon of the boat scrupled at the risk, and the first was in no humour to delay."
"“你的父亲，”船长说，“会开心而且也还是会感到满意的，只要我们把你成功地送到了。德拉蒙德小姐，这总好过听任你淹死。就按我说的做，”他说，“你不妨和我们其他人一起先去鹿特丹吧。你可以乘前往梅斯的快速帆船沿途而下直到波利尔，再从那里换乘一辆四轮马车返回赫尔沃埃特。”","“Your father,” said he, “would be gey an little pleased if we was to break a leg to ye, Miss Drummond, let-a-be drowning of you.Take my way of it,” says he, “and come on-by with the rest of us here to Rotterdam.Ye can get a passage down the Maes in a sailing scoot as far as to the Brill, and thence on again, by a place in a rattel-waggon, back to Helvoet.”"
"但是卡特里奥娜听不进任何改变计划的建议。看到浪花突然四处飞溅的时候，她的脸色看起来煞白。碧绿的海浪时不时地会倾泄到船首的甲板上，船在惊涛骇浪中不停地起伏摇晃，但是她却按照她父亲的指令仍然坚定地站在那里。“我的父亲，詹姆斯·莫尔，已经做好安排了。”她自始至终一直念叨的就是这句话。我觉得这个女孩也太古板了，居然坚决不肯听从如此善意的建议，真是迂腐之极，而且确实太任性了。不过实际上如果她据实以告的话，她的理由还是蛮充分的。快速帆船和四轮马车的确很好，只是首先得付得出钱才能够乘坐，可是她在这世上所拥有的全部财产却只有两先令和一个半便士了。结果船长和乘客尽说了一些无谓的话，因为他们都不知道她的窘境——而她又太要强而不愿告诉他们。","But Catriona would hear of no change.She looked white-like as she beheld the bursting of the sprays, the green seas that sometimes poured upon the fore-castle, and the perpetual bounding and swooping of the boat among the billows; but she stood firmly by her father’s orders.“My father, James More, will have arranged it so,” was her first word and her last.I thought it very idle and indeed wanton in the girl to be so literal and stand opposite to so much kind advice; but the fact is she had a very good reason, if she would have told us.Sailing scoots and rattel-waggons are excellent things; only the use of them must first be paid for, and all she was possessed of in the world was just two shillings and a penny halfpenny sterling.So it fell out that captain and passengers, not knowing of her destitution—and she being too proud to tell them—spoke in vain."
"“可是你既不懂法语也不懂荷兰语。”有人说道。","“But you ken nae French and nae Dutch neither,” said one."
"“的确如此，”她说，“不过自1746年以来，有那么多忠诚的苏格兰人都去了国外，所以我也会过得很好。我谢谢你们了。”","“It is very true,” says she, “but since the year ’46 there are so many of the honest Scotch abroad that I will be doing very well.I thank you.”"
"她说的这番话充满着浓郁的乡土气息，质朴无华，有人不禁笑了起来，还有些人显得更加遗憾，而格比先生霎时情绪激动起来。我相信他知道他有责任（他妻子已经受托要照看这位女孩）陪这个女孩上岸，并确保她安全无虞。但是他无论如何都不会这么做的，因为那样肯定会影响他自己的航程。所以我认为他大声叫嚷只是为了弥补自己良心的愧疚。至少他对着桑船长发作起来，愤怒地说这件事情做得太不像话了，还说离开这艘大船简直就是去找死，无论如何我们都不能把一个天真的少女送到坐满肮脏的荷兰渔夫的船上，任由其听天由命。我对此也有些类似的想法。我把大副拉到一边，和他商量要派人把我的箱子加急转送到我在莱登的住处，随后我就站起身来对那些渔夫打了个手势。","There was a pretty country simplicity in this that made some laugh, others looked the more sorry, and Mr. Gebbie fall outright in a passion.I believe he knew it was his duty (his wife having accepted charge of the girl) to have gone ashore with her and seen her safe: nothing would have induced him to have done so, since it must have involved the lose of his conveyance; and I think he made it up to his conscience by the loudness of his voice.At least he broke out upon Captain Sang, raging and saying the thing was a disgrace; that it was mere death to try to leave the ship, and at any event we could not cast down an innocent maid in a boatful of nasty Holland fishers, and leave her to her fate.I was thinking something of the same; took the mate upon one side, arranged with him to send on my chests by track-scoot to an address I had in Leyden, and stood up and signalled to the fishers."
"“我要和这位年轻的女士一起上岸，桑船长。”我说，“我从哪条路去莱登都一样。”说话的同时，我一跃跳进了小船，虽然我的动作没那么优雅，还算好我落在船舱里两个渔夫的中间了。","“I will go ashore with the young lady, Captain Sang,” said I.“It is all one what way I go to Leyden;” and leaped at the same time into the boat, which I managed not so elegantly but what I fell with two of the fishers in the bilge."
"在小船上所见的情形显得比大船上更加危险。卡特里奥娜高高地站在我们上方的大船上，随着船急速地起伏摇摆着。我们胆战心惊地看着她一路摇摇晃晃越过了锚链。我开始觉得自己做了一件蠢事，让卡特里奥娜登上小船和我在一起，那简直就不可能。那我就只好独自一人在赫尔沃埃特上岸，根本没有希望得到任何回报，当然如果我愿意的话，还是可以愉快地去享受和詹姆斯·莫尔拥抱的。但这是我还没有考虑这位少女勇气时的想法。她看见我毫无犹豫之色就跳了下去（无论如何事实如此），当然，她也不愿受那些弃她于不顾的朋友的打击。她高高地站在船的舷墙上，紧紧抓住一根船桅上的支索，风吹着她的裙摆，这使她的举动显得愈发危险，也让我们看见了她的长袜，这在城里会被认为是有失教养的。一刻都不能耽搁了，就算有人想干涉，也没有时间了。我站在小船的一侧，张开双臂，大船在我们头顶摇摆着，小船的船主尽力把船靠得更近，也许已经有几分危险了，然后卡特里奥娜向空中一跃。我很高兴能接到她，还好那些渔夫立刻扶持住了我们，我们没有跌落水中。她紧紧抓着我好一会儿，急促地深呼吸着。后来（她仍然用双手紧紧抓着我）由一位舵手引着，我们走到船尾的座位上。桑船长和所有的船员以及乘客都欢呼起来，并高喊着向我们道别，我们的小船调转船头驶向岸边。","From the boat the business appeared yet more precarious than from the ship, she stood so high over us, swung down so swift, and menaced us so perpetually with her plunging and passaging upon the anchor cable.I began to think I had made a fool’s bargain, that it was merely impossible Catriona should be got on board to me, and that I stood to be set ashore at Helvoet all by myself and with no hope of any reward but the pleasure of embracing James More, if I should want to.But this was to reckon without the lass’s courage.She had seen me leap with very little appearance (however much reality) of hesitation; to be sure, she was not to be beat by her discarded friend.Up she stood on the bulwarks and held by a stay, the wind blowing in her petticoats, which made the enterprise more dangerous, and gave us rather more of a view of her stockings than would be thought genteel in cities.There was no minute lost, and scarce time given for any to interfere if they had wished the same.I stood up on the other side and spread my arms; the ship swung down on us, the patroon humoured his boat nearer in than was perhaps wholly safe, and Catriona leaped into the air.I was so happy as to catch her, and the fishers readily supporting us, escaped a fall.She held to me a moment very tight, breathing quick and deep; thence (she still clinging to me with both hands) we were passed aft to our places by the steersman; and Captain Sang and all the crew and passengers cheering and crying farewell, the boat was put about for shore."
"卡特里奥娜一回过神就马上松了手，但却一言未发。我也没再说什么。事实上狂风呼啸、浪花飞溅，也使我们没有时间说话了。我们的船员虽然奋力地划着船，但是前行的速度却非常慢，所以我们还没到达海港口岸处，“玫瑰”号就又一次起锚离开了。","As soon as Catriona came a little to herself she unhanded me suddenly, but said no word.No more did I; and indeed the whistling of the wind and the breaching of the sprays made it no time for speech; and our crew not only toiled excessively but made extremely little way, so that the Rose had got her anchor and was off again before we had approached the harbour mouth."
"我们刚一到平静的水域，那位船主就按照他们荷兰人冷酷无情的习俗停下船来问我们要船费了。他要求每人给他两个荷兰盾——约三到四个先令的英国货币。但是一听到这句话，卡特里奥娜就激愤异常，开始大声喊叫起来。她说，她已经问过桑船长了，船费只要一先令的。“你以为我会不先问好价钱就上船吗？”她叫道。那个船主则用方言对她反唇相讥，咒骂的时候就说英语，其余说的都是地地道道的荷兰语。最后（看见她都要掉眼泪了）我私下里悄悄在那无赖的手里塞了六个先令，于是他没再多抱怨，而是非常礼貌地从她手里接过了另一个先令。无疑我觉得非常气恼和羞愧。我喜欢看到人们节俭，但也犯不着这么激动。所以我猜想，后来小船再次向岸边驶去，当我问起她和她父亲约定会合的地点时，我的语气相当冷淡。","We were no sooner in smooth water than the patroon, according to their beastly Hollands custom, stopped his boat and required of us our fares.Two guilders was the man’s demand—between three and four shillings English money—for each passenger.But at this Catriona began to cry out with a vast deal of agitation.She had asked of Captain Sang, she said, and the fare was but an English shilling.“Do you think I will have come on board and not ask first?” cries she.The patroon scolded back upon her in a lingo where the oaths were English and the rest right Hollands; till at last (seeing her near tears) I privately slipped in the rogue’s hand six shillings, whereupon he was obliging enough to receive from her the other shilling without more complaint.No doubt I was a good deal nettled and ashamed.I like to see folk thrifty, but not with so much passion; and I daresay it would be rather coldly that I asked her, as the boat moved on again for shore, where it was that she was trysted with her father."
"“到一位姓斯普罗特的家里就可以打听到他了，那是一个诚实的苏格兰商人。”她说。跟着她立即又说，“我希望好好感谢你——对我来说你是一个勇敢的朋友。”","“He is to be inquired of at the house of one Sprott, an honest Scotch merchant,” says she; and then with the same breath, “I am wishing to thank you very much—you are a brave friend to me.”"
"“我帮你找到你父亲后有的是时间。”我说，但并不认为我说的是真心话，“我会告诉他一个忠诚女儿的动人故事。”","“It will be time enough when I get you to your father,” said I, little thinking that I spoke so true.“I can tell him a fine tale of a loyal daughter.”"
"“哦，不管怎么说，我觉得我不会是一个忠诚的女儿。”她叫道，脸上的表情非常痛苦，“我觉得我的内心并不诚实。”","“O, I do not think I will be a loyal girl, at all events,” she cried, with a great deal of painfulness in the expression.“I do not think my heart is true.”"
"“可是却很少有人会那么跳下去的，而且你这么做只是为了遵从父亲的指令。”我说。","“Yet there are very few that would have made that leap, and all to obey a father’s orders,” I observed."
"“我不能让你这么看我，”她又叫道，“当时你都已经先跳下去了，我怎么能止步不跳呢？可是无论如何那并不是全部的原因。”于是，她红着脸跟我直说了她手头拮据的事实。","“I cannot have you to be thinking of me so,” she cried again.“When you had done that same, how would I stop behind?And at all events that was not all the reasons.”Whereupon, with a burning face, she told me the plain truth upon her poverty."
"“我的天哪！”我叫道，“居然让你一个人钱包空空地登上欧洲大陆，这种做法该有多么愚蠢啊——我认为这简直有失体面——太失体面了！”我叫道。","“Good guide us!” cried I, “what kind of daft-like proceeding is this, to let yourself be launched on the continent of Europe with an empty purse—I count it hardly decent—scant decent!”I cried."
"“你忘记了，我父亲詹姆斯·莫尔只是个穷困潦倒的绅士，”她说，“他是个遭通缉的流亡者。”","“You forget James More, my father, is a poor gentleman,” said she.“He is a hunted exile.”"
"“但是我觉得并非你所有的朋友都是遭通缉的流亡者呀。”我叫喊道，“你这么做，对那些关心你的人公平吗？对我公平吗？对格兰特小姐公平吗？是她劝你走这一趟的，要是她听说这件事，会被气疯的。甚至对你与之一起生活，而且对你钟爱有加的格雷戈里一家人公平吗？幸亏还有我在这里陪着你！假如你父亲意外有事被耽搁了，那你孤身一人在这么一个陌生的地方怎么办？想到这件事就让我感到恐惧。”我说。","“But I think not all your friends are hunted exiles,” I exclaimed.“And was this fair to them that care for you?Was it fair to me? was it fair to Miss Grant that counselled you to go, and would be driven fair horn-mad if she could hear of it?Was it even fair to these Gregory folk that you were living with, and used you lovingly?It’s a blessing you have fallen in my hands!Suppose your father hindered by an accident, what would become of you here, and you your lee-lone in a strange place?The thought of the thing frightens me,” I said."
"“我会对他们所有的人撒谎，”她回答道，“我会告诉他们所有的人我还有很多钱。我也是这么告诉她的。我不能在他们面前贬低詹姆斯·莫尔的身份。”","“I will have lied to all of them,” she replied.“I will have told them all that I had plenty.I told her too.I could not be lowering James More to them.”"
"后来我才发现她肯定已经让他贬低受辱了，因为该谎言原本出自那个父亲之口，却并非这个做女儿的所编，所以她不过是为了那个做父亲的名声而被迫坚持那么做的。但是当时我并没有意识到这一点，一心只想着她肯定会遇到的困境和危险，这让我心烦意乱几乎失去理性。","I found out later on that she must have lowered him in the very dust, for the lie was originally the father’s, not the daughter’s, and she thus obliged to persevere in it for the man’s reputation.But at the time I was ignorant of this, and the mere thought of her destitution and the perils in which see must have fallen, had ruffled me almost beyond reason."
"“好，好，好，”我说，“你必须要学会更加理性。”","“Well, well, well,” said I, “you will have to learn more sense.”"
"我把她的行包暂时寄放在岸边的一家小客栈里，在那里我用才学会的法语问到了去斯普罗特家的路。随后我们就朝那里走去——路程并不太远——我们一路边走边好奇地看着那个地方。实际上，对苏格兰人来说这里有很多值得赞赏之处：河道交织，绿树掩映，房舍错落有致。那些房舍，从里到外都是由鲜艳的红砖砌成的，那是玫瑰的颜色；每户门前都有台阶，两边是蓝色的大理石长椅。整个小镇非常干净，你也许都可以在街道上就餐了。斯普罗特在家，他的家在高高的台基上。他家的会客室虽然低矮，却非常整洁干净，装饰着瓷器和绘画，铜架上还有一个地球仪。他是一个颚骨宽大、脸色红润、精力充沛的人，他脸上的神色狡黠而冷峻。他让我们落座时，给人感觉不大礼貌。","I left her mails for the moment in an inn upon the shore, where I got a direction for Sprott’s house in my new French, and we walked there—it was some little way—beholding the place with wonder as we went.Indeed, there was much for Scots folk to admire: canals and trees being intermingled with the houses; the houses, each within itself, of a brave red brick, the colour of a rose, with steps and benches of blue marble at the cheek of every door, and the whole town so clean you might have dined upon the causeway.Sprott was within, upon his ledgers, in a low parlour, very neat and clean, and set out with china and pictures, and a globe of the earth in a brass frame.He was a big-chafted, ruddy, lusty man, with a crooked hard look to him; and he made us not that much civility as offer us a seat."
"“先生，詹姆斯·莫尔·麦格雷戈现在在赫尔沃埃特吗？”我说。","“Is James More Macgregor now in Helvoet, sir?” says I."
"“我不认识任何一个叫这个名字的人。”他说，一副不耐烦的样子。","“I ken nobody by such a name,” says he, impatient-like."
"“既然你那么肯定，”我说，“那我就换个问法，请问你，在赫尔沃埃特我们要去哪里才可以找到詹姆斯·德拉蒙德？他也叫麦格雷戈，也叫詹姆斯·莫尔，以前曾住在因维罗纳切利。”","“Since you are so particular,” says I, “I will amend my question, and ask you where we are to find in Helvoet one James Drummond, alias Macgregor, alias James More, late tenant in Inveronachile?”"
"“先生，”他说，“就我所知他可能住在地狱里，而对我来说，我惟愿他是在地狱里。”","“Sir,” says he, “he may be in Hell for what I ken, and for my part I wish he was.”"
"“先生，这位年轻的女士是那位绅士的女儿。”我说，“在她面前讨论他的为人不大合适，我想你也会同意我的这个观点。”","“The young lady is that gentleman’s daughter, sir,” said I, “before whom, I think you will agree with me, it is not very becoming to discuss his character.”"
"“不论对他，或者对她，还是对你，我都没有什么好说的！”他粗声大气地叫嚷道。","“I have nothing to make either with him, or her, or you!” cries he in his gross voice."
"“如果可以的话，斯普罗特先生，”我说，“这位年轻女士是从苏格兰赶来寻找他的，不论有什么样的误会，她只得到你家的名称可以来打听方向。虽然好像是出了一点儿错，可是我觉得这正好让你和我——我也只是碰巧成为了这姑娘的旅伴——都有强烈的责任来帮助我们这位同胞姑娘。”","“Under your favour, Mr. Sprott,” said I, “this young lady is come from Scotland seeking him, and by whatever mistake, was given the name of your house for a direction.An error it seems to have been, but I think this places both you and me—who am but her fellow-traveller by accident—under a strong obligation to help our countrywoman.”"
"“你是要把我当成傻瓜吗？”他叫道，“我告诉你我什么都不知道，而且我更加不关心他或者他的子女。我告诉你那个家伙欠了我的钱。”","“Will you ding me daft?” he cries.“I tell ye I ken naething and care less either for him or his breed.I tell ye the man owes me money.”"
"“很可能是那样，先生。”我说，现在我比他还要气愤，“至少，我没欠你什么，这位年轻的女士受我保护。而我对你这种态度根本就不习惯，也一点儿都不满意。”","“That may very well be, sir,” said I, who was now rather more angry than himself.“At least, I owe you nothing; the young lady is under my protection; and I am neither at all used with these manners, nor in the least content with them.”"
"我说这番话的时候，未加思索自己的举止，便朝他的桌子靠进了一两步。于是，纯粹是运气好，这么反驳了一番居然就对这个人产生了彻底的影响。他活力充沛的面庞瞬间失去了血色。","As I said this, and without particularly thinking what I did, I drew a step or two nearer to his table; thus striking, by mere good fortune, on the only argument that could at all affect the man.The blood left his lusty countenance."
"“先生，看在上帝的份上，千万不要心急！”他叫道，“我真的不想冒犯你。可是你要知道，先生，我是为数不多的心地善良、为人诚实、性情开朗的老人了——我虽然叫得凶，但我不会伤人的。听我说，有时候你可以把我想成是一个不起眼的倔老头。但是不对，不对！我桑迪·斯普罗特内心里其实是一个善良的老伙计。而且你永远都想象不出那个家伙给我添了多少忙乱，带来了多少烦恼。”","“For the Lord’s sake dinna be hasty, sir!” he cried.“I am truly wishfu’ no to be offensive.But ye ken, sir, I’m like a wheen guid-natured, honest, canty auld fellows—my bark is waur nor my bite.To hear me, ye micht whiles fancy I was a wee thing dour; but na, na! it’s a kind auld fallow at heart, Sandie Sprott!And ye could never imagine the fyke and fash this man has been to me.”"
"“很好，先生，”我说，“那么我就毫不讲客气地接受你的好意了，麻烦你告诉我你所了解的关于德拉蒙德先生最近的消息。”","“Very good, sir,” said I.“Then I will make that much freedom with your kindness as trouble you for your last news of Mr. Drummond.”"
"“不用客气，先生！”他说，“至于这位年轻的女士（我很尊敬她！），他怕是已经把她给忘得干干净净了。你要知道，我了解这个人。为了他，我之前可损失了不少钱呢。他是只顾自己从不考虑他人的。什么部族、国王，或者女儿，他只要把自己的肚子填饱了，就会把他们统统忘到九霄云外！唉，或者也把他的联络员忘得一干二净了。因为从某种意义来说，我也差不多可以算是他的联络员了。事实上，我们同时受雇在一家公司做事，不过我觉得对我桑迪·斯普罗特来说那可真是一桩倒霉事。那个家伙的确是我的搭档，可是我只能告诉你，我真的不知道他在哪里。 他也许正在来赫尔沃埃特的路上，也许今天早上就会到这里，也许要过一年才会来，我一点都不觉得惊讶——或者说我只关心一件事，那就是他是否会还我的钱。你要明白我的处事方式就是这样。显然我是不大可能像你那样去管这位女士的闲事的。有一件事情可以肯定，那就是她不能住在这里。哎呀，先生，我可是一个单身男人啊！要是我让她留下，极有可能那个家伙一露面就会逼着我娶她。”","“You’re welcome, sir!” said he.“As for the young leddy (my respects to her!), he’ll just have clean forgotten her.I ken the man, ye see; I have lost siller by him ere now.He thinks of naebody but just himsel’; clan, king, or dauchter, if he can get his wameful, he would give them a’ the go-by! ay, or his correspondent either.For there is a sense in whilk I may be nearly almost said to be his correspondent.The fact is, we are employed thegether in a business affair, and I think it’s like to turn out a dear affair for Sandie Sprott.The man’s as guid’s my pairtner, and I give ye my mere word I ken naething by where he is.He micht be coming here to Helvoet; he micht come here the morn, he michtnae come for a twalmouth; I would wonder at naething—or just at the ae thing, and that’s if he was to pay me my siller.Ye see what way I stand with it; and it’s clear I’m no very likely to meddle up with the young leddy, as ye ca’ her.She cannae stop here, that’s ae thing certain sure.Dod, sir, I’m a lone man!If I was to tak her in, its highly possible the hellicat would try and gar me marry her when he turned up.”"
"“够了，”我说，“我会带这位年轻女士到那些更好的朋友那里去。给我笔、墨水和纸张，我会在这里给詹姆斯·莫尔留下我在莱登的通信地址。他可以向我打听到哪里去找他女儿。”","“Enough of this talk,” said I.“I will take the young leddy among better friends.Give me, pen, ink, and paper, and I will leave here for James More the address of my correspondent in Leyden.He can inquire from me where he is to seek his daughter.”"
"我写下了这句话，并把信封好口。在我做这件事的时候，斯普罗特用自己的行动表现出一副很配合的样子，提出要负责德拉蒙德小姐的行李，甚至还派门房帮忙把行李搬进了旅馆。我给他预付了那么一两块钱来办理此事，而他则给了我一张收条，上面写着具体金额。","This word I wrote and sealed; which while I was doing, Sprott of his own motion made a welcome offer, to charge himself with Miss Drummond’s mails, and even send a porter for them to the inn.I advanced him to that effect a dollar or two to be a cover, and he gave me an acknowledgment in writing of the sum."
"于是（我向卡特里奥娜伸出手臂让她挽着）我们就离开了这个令人厌恶的无赖的房子。她始终一言未发，由我代替她决定和表态。而我这边则一直很小心地不让她为一个白眼而感到尴尬。甚至此时，尽管我内心因为羞愧和愤怒仍然怒火中烧，但我还是尽力显出相当轻松的样子。","Whereupon (I giving my arm to Catriona) we left the house of this unpalatable rascal.She had said no word throughout, leaving me to judge and speak in her place; I, upon my side, had been careful not to embarrass her by a glance; and even now, although my heart still glowed inside of me with shame and anger, I made it my affair to seem quite easy."
"“现在，”我说，“我们回那个人们会说法语的小客栈去吧，吃点儿东西，再去打听怎么去鹿特丹。再次把你安全地交给格比夫人之前，我绝不会有所懈怠。”","“Now,” said I, “let us get back to yon same inn where they can speak the French, have a piece of dinner, and inquire for conveyances to Rotterdam.I will never be easy till I have you safe again in the hands of Mrs. Gebbie.”"
"“我想只能这么做了，”卡特里奥娜说，“就算别人都会感到高兴，我想她是不会高兴的。我想再一次提醒你，我只有一个先令和三枚半便士的硬币了。”","“I suppose it will have to be,” said Catriona, “though whoever will be pleased, I do not think it will be her.And I will remind you this once again that I have but one shilling, and three baubees.”"
"“再说一次，”我说，“我也提醒你幸亏有我陪着你。”","“And just this once again,” said I, “I will remind you it was a blessing that I came alongst with you.”"
"“这段时间我还能有别的什么想法吗？”她说，我觉得手臂上的分量稍微压重了一点儿，“只有你才是我的好朋友啊。”","“What else would I be thinking all this time?” says she, and I thought weighed a little on my arm.“It is you that are the good friend to me.”"
"第二十三章 荷兰之旅","CHAPTER XXIII—TRAVELS IN HOLLAND"
"那辆四轮马车是一种配有长椅的长长的马车，它载着我们长途跋涉四个小时来到了鹿特丹这个大城市。当时夜幕早已降临，但街道灯火通明，熙熙攘攘挤满了充满野性、具有异域风情的人群——蓄着胡须的希伯来人、黑人和成群的妓女，这些妓女大多装扮低俗、衣着艳丽，在拉着水手的衣袖想留住他们。那些叽叽喳喳议论我们的声音弄得我们头晕脑胀，最让人意想不到的是，似乎我们对这些外国人的好奇竟然不比我们带给他们的惊诧强烈。为了卡特里奥娜和我自己的尊严，我尽量摆出最友善的表情。但是实际上我就像一只迷途的羔羊，我的心因为忧虑而在胸膛里怦怦狂跳。有那么一两次，我打听港口或者“玫瑰”号的停泊处，但是要么就是碰到的人只会说荷兰语，要么就是我自己的法语太糟而未能打听到。摸索着穿过一条街道，我突然发现一条小巷，两边房屋都亮着灯，门口和窗边都聚集着一些浓妆艳抹的女人。我们从那里经过时，她们对我们推推搡搡、肆意嘲笑，我很庆幸我们根本不懂她们的语言。之后不一会儿，我们来到了港口沿岸的一片开阔地。","The rattel-waggon, which is a kind of a long waggon set with benches, carried us in four hours of travel to the great city of Rotterdam.It was long past dark by then, but the streets were pretty brightly lighted and thronged with wild-like, outlandish characters—bearded Hebrews, black men, and the hordes of courtesans, most indecently adorned with finery and stopping seamen by their very sleeves; the clash of talk about us made our heads to whirl; and what was the most unexpected of all, we appeared to be no more struck with all these foreigners than they with us.I made the best face I could, for the lass’s sake and my own credit; but the truth is I felt like a lost sheep, and my heart beat in my bosom with anxiety.Once or twice I inquired after the harbour or the berth of the ship Rose: but either fell on some who spoke only Hollands, or my own French failed me.Trying a street at a venture, I came upon a lane of lighted houses, the doors and windows thronged with wauf-like painted women; these jostled and mocked upon us as we passed, and I was thankful we had nothing of their language.A little after we issued forth upon an open place along the harbour."
"“我们现在就开始找吧，”我一看见桅杆就大声喊道，“我们就从这里沿着港口走。我们肯定能碰到一些说英语的人，而且运气很好的话，我们有可能正好找到那艘船。”","“We shall be doing now,” cries I, as soon as I spied masts.“Let us walk here by the harbour.We are sure to meet some that has the English, and at the best of it we may light upon that very ship.”"
"还真是如此，我们就碰到了第二种运气。因为，大约晚上九点钟的时候，除了桑船长，还会有谁会伸出双臂欢迎我们呢？他告诉我们，他们顶着狂风，用短得不可思议的时间抵达了此港口。因此，他的那些旅客都已经离去，踏上更远的行程了。要想追赶格比一家到德国高地是不可能了，而我们在这里除了桑船长之外又别无其他熟人可以投靠。能够找到这么友好而又愿意提供帮助的人，真是让人再开心不过了。他没怎么费事就找到了一个好心的普通商人家庭，卡特里奥娜可以在那里住到“玫瑰”号装完货物。他还宣称他非常乐意分文不收把她带回利斯，然后把她安全地交到格雷戈里先生手上。同时他还带我们去一家新开的小餐馆饱餐一顿，这正是我们所需要的。正如我所说的，他看起来好像特别友好，但是让我非常吃惊的是，他处事相当粗野，而其根源很快就显露出来了。就是在那家餐馆，他叫了莱茵白葡萄酒并猛灌起来，很快他就醉得东倒西歪了。在这种情况下，对所有的男人，尤其对他这种做粗活的人来说，仅有的一点点理智和礼貌都丧失殆尽，那是再常见不过了。他言行失当，竟然出言中伤这位年轻女士，最令人反感的是他还嘲笑她在船舷上的形象，我没有办法，只好立刻带她离开那里。","We did the next best, as happened; for, about nine of the evening, whom should we walk into the arms of but Captain Sang?He told us they had made their run in the most incredible brief time, the wind holding strong till they reached port; by which means his passengers were all gone already on their further travels.It was impossible to chase after the Gebbies into the High Germany, and we had no other acquaintance to fall back upon but Captain Sang himself.It was the more gratifying to find the man friendly and wishful to assist.He made it a small affair to find some good plain family of merchants, where Catriona might harbour till the Rose was loaden; declared he would then blithely carry her back to Leith for nothing and see her safe in the hands of Mr. Gregory; and in the meanwhile carried us to a late ordinary for the meal we stood in need of.He seemed extremely friendly, as I say, but what surprised me a good deal, rather boisterous in the bargain; and the cause of this was soon to appear.For at the ordinary, calling for Rhenish wine and drinking of it deep, he soon became unutterably tipsy.In this case, as too common with all men, but especially with those of his rough trade, what little sense or manners he possessed deserted him; and he behaved himself so scandalous to the young lady, jesting most ill-favouredly at the figure she had made on the ship’s rail, that I had no resource but carry her suddenly away."
"她紧紧靠着我走出了那家餐馆。“带我离开，戴维，”她说，“你守着我。和你在一起我什么都不怕。”","She came out of the ordinary clinging to me close.“Take me away, David,” she said.“You keep me.I am not afraid with you.”"
"“没有理由害怕，我的小朋友！”我叫道，但却发现自己内心在哭泣。","“And have no cause, my little friend!” cried I, and could have found it in my heart to weep."
"“你要带我去哪里？”她又说道，“无论如何不要离开我——永远也不要离开我。”","“Where will you be taking me?” she said again.“Don’t leave me at all events—never leave me.”"
"“我要带你去哪里？”我说着停了下来，因为我对未来也是一片茫然，“我必须停下来考虑考虑。但是我不会离开你的，卡特里奥娜。如果我没有做到或者惹你生气了，上帝会同样惩罚我，甚至会惩罚得更多。”","“Where am I taking you to?” says I stopping, for I had been staving on ahead in mere blindness.“I must stop and think.But I’ll not leave you, Catriona; the Lord do so to me, and more also, if I should fail or fash you.”"
"她紧紧依偎着我，以此作为回答。","She crept close into me by way of a reply."
"“这里，”我说，“是我们在这个拥挤的都市中难得一遇的最安静的地方。让我们在那棵树下坐一坐，考虑考虑下一步的行动。”","“Here,” I said, “is the stillest place we have hit on yet in this busy byke of a city.Let us sit down here under yon tree and consider of our course.”"
"那棵树（我不太可能忘记）就立在海港附近。那晚夜色漆黑，但家家户户都透着灯光，静静靠在码头边的近在咫尺的轮船也灯光一片。一方面这里有着城市的华丽，充斥着成千上万的人在行走、聊天时所汇成的喧闹声；另一方面它又是黑暗的，只有海水不停拍打着海岸。我把披风铺在一块建筑石料上，让她坐在那里。她还是牢牢地挽着我，因为她对刚才受到的侮辱仍然心有余悸。但是我需要考虑清楚，就抽出身来，在她面前来回踱着步，用我们所谓的走私者的步伐在踱步，同时绞尽脑汁在思考补救对策。这么胡思乱想的过程中，我突然清晰地记起我们因为生气而匆忙离开，就餐的费用就留给桑船长去付了。想到这一点我不禁笑出声来，因为我认为那个家伙是活该。而同时，出于一种本能的动作，我把手伸进口袋里放钱的地方。但是我发现只有一件事是可以肯定的，那就是我的钱包不见了。我猜想就是在小巷中那些女人推搡我们的时候丢的。","That tree (which I am little like to forget) stood hard by the harbour side.It was like a black night, but lights were in the houses, and nearer hand in the quiet ships; there was a shining of the city on the one hand, and a buzz hung over it of many thousands walking and talking; on the other, it was dark and the water bubbled on the sides.I spread my cloak upon a builder’s stone, and made her sit there; she would have kept her hold upon me, for she still shook with the late affronts; but I wanted to think clear, disengaged myself, and paced to and fro before her, in the manner of what we call a smuggler’s walk, belabouring my brains for any remedy.By the course of these scattering thoughts I was brought suddenly face to face with a remembrance that, in the heat and haste of our departure, I had left Captain Sang to pay the ordinary.At this I began to laugh out loud, for I thought the man well served; and at the same time, by an instinctive movement, carried my hand to the pocket where my money was.I suppose it was in the lane where the women jostled us; but there is only the one thing certain, that my purse was gone."
"“你应该想些开心的事。”她说道，她注意到我突然停了下来。","“You will have thought of something good,” said she, observing me to pause."
"我们得过紧日子了，我的头脑突然像望远镜一样清晰，我明白我们没有选择的余地了。我已经身无分文，但是在我的笔记本里还有一封给莱登商人的信。现在只有一种办法可以去莱登了，那就是靠我们的双脚走去。","At the pinch we were in, my mind became suddenly clear as a perspective glass, and I saw there was no choice of methods.I had not one doit of coin, but in my pocket-book I had still my letter on the Leyden merchant; and there was now but the one way to get to Leyden, and that was to walk on our two feet."
"“卡特里奥娜，”我说，“我知道你很勇敢，我也相信你很强壮——你觉得你能在平路上走三十英里吗？”我确定，后来我们发现那段距离其实还不到这个数的三分之二，但是我当时估算的距离就是这么长。","“Catriona,” said I, “I know you’re brave and I believe you’re strong—do you think you could walk thirty miles on a plain road?”We found it, I believe, scarce the two-thirds of that, but such was my notion of the distance."
"“戴维，”她说，“只要有你在身旁，我愿意去任何地方，愿意做任何事情。我内心的勇气已经完全破灭了。千万不要把我一个人留在这个可怕的国家，要我做什么都可以。”","“David,” she said, “if you will just keep near, I will go anywhere and do anything.The courage of my heart, it is all broken.Do not be leaving me in this horrible country by myself, and I will do all else.”"
"“你能现在就动身，并且通宵赶路吗？”我说。","“Can you start now and march all night?” said I."
"“我愿意做所有你让我做的事，”她说，“而且绝不问你为什么。我曾经对你那么不领情，现在我要做让你满意的事情！而且我觉得芭芭拉·格兰特小姐是这世上最好的女士，”她补充说道，“我认为无论如何她都不会拒绝你。”","“I will do all that you can ask of me,” she said, “and never ask you why.I have been a bad ungrateful girl to you; and do what you please with me now!And I think Miss Barbara Grant is the best lady in the world,” she added, “and I do not see what she would deny you for at all events.”"
"她这番话让我完全摸不着头脑。不过我还有别的事情要考虑，首先就是要弄清楚这座城市去莱登的路。结果证明这是一个非常难以解决的问题，可能到半夜一两点钟的时候我们才弄清楚了。一旦离开住宅区，既没有星星也没有月亮为我们指引方向，只有中间那条路泛着白色，小巷的两边则漆黑一片。此外，凌晨时分突然降了一场严霜，结果那条公路变成了一条长长的滑道，这使我们的行走尤为艰难。","This was Greek and Hebrew to me; but I had other matters to consider, and the first of these was to get clear of that city on the Leyden road.It proved a cruel problem; and it may have been one or two at night ere we had solved it.Once beyond the houses, there was neither moon nor stars to guide us; only the whiteness of the way in the midst and a blackness of an alley on both hands.The walking was besides made most extraordinary difficult by a plain black frost that fell suddenly in the small hours and turned that highway into one long slide."
"“哎呀，卡特里奥娜，”我说，“我们现在就像你讲的那些可笑的高地故事里的国王的儿子们和老妇人的女儿们一样。不久我们将会跨越‘七座山峰、七条峡谷和七片山里的荒野’。”这是一句普通的俗语，或许在她讲的故事中很突出，所以就深深印在我的记忆中了。","“Well, Catriona,” said I, “here we are like the king’s sons and the old wives’ daughters in your daft-like Highland tales.Soon we’ll be going over the ‘seven Bens, the seven glens and the seven mountain moors’.”Which was a common byword or overcome in those tales of hers that had stuck in my memory."
"“啊，”她说，“可是这里既没有峡谷也没有山脉呀！尽管我绝不否认这一带的树林和平原非常美丽。不过我们的国家仍然是最好的。”","“Ah,” says she, “but here are no glens or mountains!Though I will never be denying but what the trees and some of the plain places hereabouts are very pretty.But our country is the best yet.”"
"“我希望我们能多为我们自己家乡的人说一说。”我说，回想起了斯普罗特和桑船长，也许还有詹姆斯·莫尔本人。","“I wish we could say as much for our own folk,” says I, recalling Sprott and Sang, and perhaps James More himself."
"“我从不抱怨我朋友的国家。”她说，说话的口音很奇特，我好像都看见了她脸上的表情。","“I will never complain of the country of my friend,” said she, and spoke it out with an accent so particular that I seemed to see the look upon her face."
"我猛然屏住呼吸，差一点儿摔倒在薄冰上（费了很大的劲才稳住）。","I caught in my breath sharp and came near falling (for my pains) on the black ice."
"“我不知道你怎么想，卡特里奥娜，”我稍稍恢复平稳后说道，“但这仍然是最美好的一天！在你碰到这种种不幸和不如意的时候，我觉得这么说真的很惭愧。不过对我来说，这仍然是最美好的一天。”","“I do not know what you think, Catriona,” said I, when I was a little recovered, “but this has been the best day yet!I think shame to say it, when you have met in with such misfortunes and disfavours; but for me, it has been the best day yet.”"
"“当你对我表现出这么多爱的时候，这就是美好的一天了。”她说。","“It was a good day when you showed me so much love,” said she."
"“而且我还感到羞愧的是我居然感到高兴，”我继续说道，“因为你在这个黑夜里和我一起在路上。”","“And yet I think shame to be happy too,” I went on, “and you here on the road in the black night.”"
"“在这个诺大的世界里，我还能到哪里去？”她叫道，“我在想，和你在一起我才是最安全的。”","“Where in the great world would I be else?” she cried.“I am thinking I am safest where I am with you.”"
"“那么，你完全原谅我了？”我问。","“I am quite forgiven, then?” I asked."
"“难道你这个时候就不能多多原谅我，嘴里不要再说出这种话了？”她叫道，“在我心里对你只有感激。但是我也得说实话，”她有点儿突然地补充道，“我永远也不会原谅那个女孩。”","“Will you not forgive me that time so much as not to take it in your mouth again?” she cried.“There is nothing in this heart to you but thanks.But I will be honest too,” she added, with a kind of suddenness, “and I’ll never can forgive that girl.”"
"“这又是指格兰特小姐吗？”我说，“你自己才说过她是这世上最好的女士。”","“Is this Miss Grant again?” said I.“You said yourself she was the best lady in the world.”"
"“她是这样的，的确！”卡特里奥娜说，“但是尽管如此，我永远也不会原谅她。我永远永远也不会原谅她，而且以后不要再跟我说起她。”","“So she will be, indeed!” says Catriona.“But I will never forgive her for all that.I will never, never forgive her, and let me hear tell of her no more.”"
"“好吧，”我说，“这是我实在没有想到的，而且我奇怪你居然任由自己有这么孩子气的想法。这位年轻的女士，她对我们俩来说都是这个世上最好的朋友，她教我们如何打扮自己，教我们如何举止优雅得体，凡是认识我们的人都看得出我们前后的变化。”","“Well,” said I, “this beats all that ever came to my knowledge; and I wonder that you can indulge yourself in such bairnly whims.Here is a young lady that was the best friend in the world to the both of us, that learned us how to dress ourselves, and in a great manner how to behave, as anyone can see that knew us both before and after.”"
"但是卡特里奥娜态度坚定地在公路中间停了下来。","But Catriona stopped square in the midst of the highway."
"“再这样下去的话，”她说，“要么你就继续谈论她，那我就返回那个城镇，上帝高兴怎么样就怎么样吧！要么你就对我礼貌一点儿，说说别的事情。”","“It is this way of it,” said she.“Either you will go on to speak of her, and I will go back to yon town, and let come of it what God pleases!Or else you will do me that politeness to talk of other things.”"
"我当时尴尬极了。不过我想到她完全得依靠我的帮助，想到她还只是个脆弱的少女，甚至还没有完全长大，所以对我们两个人来说应该是我要保持明智才对。","I was the most nonplussed person in this world; but I bethought me that she depended altogether on my help, that she was of the frail sex and not so much beyond a child, and it was for me to be wise for the pair of us."
"“我亲爱的姑娘，”我说，“我对这件事情完全摸不着头脑，不过上帝不许我做任何让你一意孤行的事。至于谈起格兰特小姐，并不是我有意提起这个话题，我认为是你自己先说起的。我唯一的想法（如果我真的和你说清楚了的话）就是让你自己有所改进，因为我不喜欢那种待人不公平的样子。并不是我不希望你有强烈的自尊心以及好女孩所具备的敏感，这些品质会让你变得很好。但是你现在表现得过分了。”","“My dear girl,” said I, “I can make neither head nor tails of this; but God forbid that I should do anything to set you on the jee.As for talking of Miss Grant, I have no such a mind to it, and I believe it was yourself began it.My only design (if I took you up at all) was for your own improvement, for I hate the very look of injustice.Not that I do not wish you to have a good pride and a nice female delicacy; they become you well; but here you show them to excess.”"
"“好吧，那么，你说完了吗？”她说。","“Well, then, have you done?” said she."
"“我说完了。”我说。","“I have done,” said I."
"“很好。”她说，然后我们又继续前行，但是现在都缄口不言了。","“A very good thing,” said she, and we went on again, but now in silence."
"在深夜里行走还真有点儿恐怖，只看到自己的影子，也只听到自己的脚步声。起初，我相信我们对彼此充满怨气，但是那黑暗和寒冷，还有那只会间或被公鸡的打鸣声或者农场的狗吠声打破的寂静，很快就让我们的自尊心扫地了。尤其对我来说，我恨不得立马不顾颜面开口说几句话。","It was an eerie employment to walk in the gross night, beholding only shadows and hearing nought but our own steps.At first, I believe our hearts burned against each other with a deal of enmity; but the darkness and the cold, and the silence, which only the cocks sometimes interrupted, or sometimes the farmyard dogs, had pretty soon brought down our pride to the dust; and for my own particular, I would have jumped at any decent opening for speech."
"天将破晓时，下起了一场温暖的小雨，彻底驱走了我们脚边的霜冻。我拿着披风走向她，想尽量和她一起遮雨，她向我致了谢，但很不耐烦，然后披上了。","Before the day peeped, came on a warmish rain, and the frost was all wiped away from among our feet.I took my cloak to her and sought to hap her in the same; she bade me, rather impatiently, to keep it."
"“其实我也不想这样做。”我说，“我是一个经历过各种风霜雨雪的大个子丑陋少年，而你却是一位柔弱的美丽少女！亲爱的，你不会让我难堪吧？”","“Indeed and I will do no such thing,” said I.“Here am I, a great, ugly lad that has seen all kinds of weather, and here are you a tender, pretty maid!My dear, you would not put me to a shame?”"
"没再多说她就让我来帮她遮雨了。就像我在黑暗中一直做的那样，我把手放在她肩上片刻，几乎像是拥抱着她了。","Without more words she let me cover her; which as I was doing in the darkness, I let my hand rest a moment on her shoulder, almost like an embrace."
"“你一定要尽量对你的朋友耐心一些。”我说。","“You must try to be more patient of your friend,” said I."
"我觉得她依偎在我怀中，似乎把这世上最微小的事情都交付给我了，或许这只是幻觉而已。","I thought she seemed to lean the least thing in the world against my bosom, or perhaps it was but fancy."
"“你对我的好意，我永远都不会忘记。”她说。","“There will be no end to your goodness,” said she."
"接着我们又一次陷入沉默，但现在一切都已经发生了变化。我内心的欢乐就像一团在烟囱中熊熊燃烧的火。","And we went on again in silence; but now all was changed; and the happiness that was in my heart was like a fire in a great chimney."
"天亮前雨停了。那是一个阴冷潮湿的早晨，我们来到了代尔夫特镇 。运河两岸那些红色山墙的房子汇成了一道亮丽的风景。女仆们都已经出来，在擦洗着公路边的那些路缘石。近百户人家的厨房升起了袅袅的炊烟，我这才强烈地意识到是我们该吃早饭的时候了。","The rain passed ere day; it was but a sloppy morning as we came into the town of Delft.The red gabled houses made a handsome show on either hand of a canal; the servant lassies were out slestering and scrubbing at the very stones upon the public highway; smoke rose from a hundred kitchens; and it came in upon me strongly it was time to break our fasts."
"“卡特里奥娜，”我说，“我相信你身上还有一先令和三枚半个便士吧？”","“Catriona,” said I, “I believe you have yet a shilling and three baubees?”"
"“你要吗？”她边说边把钱包递给了我，“我希望那是五英镑！你要它做什么？”","“Are you wanting it?” said she, and passed me her purse.“I am wishing it was five pounds!What will you want it for?”"
"“我们像一对流浪的埃及人一样走了整整一夜的路，原因何在！”我说，“就是因为我的钱包和所有随身的财物都在那个倒霉的鹿特丹市被盗劫一空了。我现在可以告诉你了，因为我认为最艰难的时刻已经过去了。但是我们还得走好大一段路才能拿到我的钱，所以要是你不给我买一点儿吃的东西，我就得饿肚子了。”","“And what have we been walking for all night, like a pair of waif Egyptians!” says I.“Just because I was robbed of my purse and all I possessed in that unchancy town of Rotterdam.I will tell you of it now, because I think the worst is over, but we have still a good tramp before us till we get to where my money is, and if you would not buy me a piece of bread, I were like to go fasting.”"
"她睁大眼睛看着我。在晨光下，她因为疲倦而眼神黯淡、脸色苍白，我的内心不由为她感到深深的自责。但是她呢，她却大笑了起来。","She looked at me with open eyes.By the light of the new day she was all black and pale for weariness, so that my heart smote me for her.But as for her, she broke out laughing."
"“真要命！那我们不是成乞丐了！”她叫道，“你也一样？哦，我本应该想到这一点的！我很高兴给你买早餐。但是如果我能跳舞来为你换一顿饭该会有多开心啊！因为我相信这里的人没怎么见过我们跳舞的风格，也许会因为好奇而想一睹舞姿，愿意付钱呢。”","“My torture! are we beggars then!” she cried.“You too?O, I could have wished for this same thing!And I am glad to buy your breakfast to you.But it would be pleisand if I would have had to dance to get a meal to you!For I believe they are not very well acquainted with our manner of dancing over here, and might be paying for the curiosity of that sight.”"
"为她那句话我差一点儿吻了她，不是情人的那种想法，而是出于一股钦佩的冲动。因为看到女人勇敢，男人总会感受到温暖的。","I could have kissed her for that word, not with a lover’s mind, but in a heat of admiration.For it always warms a man to see a woman brave."
"我们从一个农妇那里买了一瓶牛奶，还是刚送进城的，然后我们在面包店买了一片非常棒的热乎面包，味道很香。我们在路上一边走一边吃着。从代尔夫特到海牙只有五英里路，那是一条很不错的林荫大道，绿荫遮蔽，一边是运河，另一边是成片成片上好的牧场。这里的景致的确令人赏心悦目。","We got a drink of milk from a country wife but new come to the town, and in a baker’s, a piece of excellent, hot, sweet-smelling bread, which we ate upon the road as we went on.That road from Delft to the Hague is just five miles of a fine avenue shaded with trees, a canal on the one hand, on the other excellent pastures of cattle.It was pleasant here indeed."
"“现在，戴维，”她说，“不管怎样，你打算拿我怎么办？”","“And now, Davie,” said she, “what will you do with me at all events?”"
"“这正是我们得谈一谈的，”我说，“而且越早越好。到莱登我就可以拿到钱了，那就一切都好办了。不过麻烦的是在你父亲来之前如何安排你才好。我想到昨天晚上你好像有点儿誓同我分道扬镳的样子？”","“It is what we have to speak of,” said I, “and the sooner yet the better.I can come by money in Leyden; that will be all well.But the trouble is how to dispose of you until your father come.I thought last night you seemed a little sweir to part from me?”"
"“远不止是那个样子。”她说。","“It will be more than seeming then,” said she."
"“你是一位非常年轻的姑娘，”我说，“而我也还是一个很年轻的毛头小子。这正是最大的难处。我们用什么办法来处理呢？的确，除非你能装成我的妹妹？”","“You are a very young maid,” said I, “and I am but a very young callant.This is a great piece of difficulty.What way are we to manage?Unless indeed, you could pass to be my sister?”"
"“为什么不呢？”她说，“只要你让我这么做！”","“And what for no?” said she, “if you would let me!”"
"“其实我是希望你这么做，”我叫道，“如果我有这样一个妹妹，我会是一个不错的男子汉的。可是难就难在你是卡特里奥娜·德拉蒙德。”","“I wish you were so, indeed,” I cried.“I would be a fine man if I had such a sister.But the rub is that you are Catriona Drummond.”"
"“那我现在就是卡特里奥娜·鲍尔弗。”她说，“谁又会知道呢？这里的人都是陌生人。”","“And now I will be Catriona Balfour,” she said.“And who is to ken?They are all strange folk here.”"
"“如果你觉得那样可以的话，”我说，“我承认这让我很烦心。如果我给你的建议根本就是错误的话，那我就不可能愿意那么做。”","“If you think that it would do,” says I.“I own it troubles me.I would like it very ill, if I advised you at all wrong.”"
"“戴维，除了你，我在这里根本就没有朋友了。”她说。","“David, I have no friend here but you,” she said."
"“实际情况是，我还太年轻不能做你的朋友。”我说，“我还太年轻，不能给你忠告，也无法让你接受忠告。我不清楚我们下一步该做什么，可是我还是应该提醒你。”","“The mere truth is, I am too young to be your friend,” said I.“I am too young to advise you, or you to be advised.I see not what else we are to do, and yet I ought to warn you.”"
"“我根本就没有选择的余地了，”她说，“我父亲詹姆斯·莫尔对我一直不太好，而且这也不是第一次了。我就像一袋大麦一样被抛在了你的手上，我别无他想，只要你高兴就行了。如果你愿意接受我，那是再好不过了。如果你不愿意的话，”她转身用手碰碰我的胳膊，“戴维，我害怕。”她说。","“I will have no choice left,” said she.“My father James More has not used me very well, and it is not the first time, I am cast upon your hands like a sack of barley meal, and have nothing else to think of but your pleasure.If you will have me, good and well.If you will not”—she turned and touched her hand upon my arm—“David, I am afraid,” said she."
"“不会的，不过我应该要提醒你。”我开始说，跟着我又想到我是拿钱付账的人，这样一来我怎么说都不会显得过于无礼了。“卡特里奥娜，”我说，“千万不要误会我，我只是竭尽所能在对你负责，姑娘！我独自一人来到这个陌生的城市，只是这里一个孤寂的学生，现在居然有这么个机会让你和我一起生活，你就像我的妹妹。亲爱的，我非常愿意接受你，你肯定很清楚这一点吧？”","“No, but I ought to warn you,” I began; and then bethought me I was the bearer of the purse, and it would never do to seem too churlish.“Catriona,” said I, “don’t misunderstand me: I am just trying to do my duty by you, girl!Here am I going alone to this strange city, to be a solitary student there; and here is this chance arisen that you might dwell with me a bit, and be like my sister; you can surely understand this much, my dear, that I would just love to have you?”"
"“好吧，我留在这里了，”她说，“就这么定了。”","“Well, and here I am,” said she.“So that’s soon settled.”"
"我知道我应该尽责任把事情说得更清楚一些。我知道这是我性格上一个很大的弱点，幸好我并没有为此付出更昂贵的代价。但是我想到她很敏感，连芭芭拉信上写的一个吻字都那么容易让她吃惊不悦了。既然她要依靠我，我怎么才能更大胆一些呢？此外，事实上，我也不知道还有什么其他可行的办法可以来安置她。我敢说是我对她的好感强有力地促使我作出了决定。","I know I was in duty bounden to have spoke more plain.I know this was a great blot on my character, for which I was lucky that I did not pay more dear.But I minded how easy her delicacy had been startled with a word of kissing her in Barbara’s letter; now that she depended on me, how was I to be more bold?Besides, the truth is, I could see no other feasible method to dispose of her.And I daresay inclination pulled me very strong."
"快到海牙时，她的脚瘸得很厉害，剩下的那段路程走得非常艰难。她不得不在路边休息了两次，对此她多次表示歉意，说她自己给高地人和她的家族蒙羞了，还说她对我而言也只是一个负担。她自己解释说，是因为她不太习惯穿着鞋子走路。我本应该让她脱掉鞋袜赤脚走路才是。但是她向我指出那个国家的女人，就算是在陆路上走，好像也都是穿着鞋的。","A little beyond the Hague she fell very lame and made the rest of the distance heavily enough.Twice she must rest by the wayside, which she did with pretty apologies, calling herself a shame to the Highlands and the race she came of, and nothing but a hindrance to myself.It was her excuse, she said, that she was not much used with walking shod.I would have had her strip off her shoes and stockings and go barefoot.But she pointed out to me that the women of that country, even in the landward roads, appeared to be all shod."
"“我绝不能给我的哥哥丢脸。”她一副非常愉快的样子说道，虽然她的脸色透露了她的真实想法。","“I must not be disgracing my brother,” said she, and was very merry with it all, although her face told tales of her."
"莱登城里有一座花园是我们一定要去的地方。那里脚下铺满细沙，头顶上绿树交织相连，有些树修剪齐整，有些树装饰有型，树篱小径和藤架凉亭把整座花园装扮得颇为美丽。 我让卡特里奥娜留在这里，我自己则继续去找我那位通信联系人。在那里我凭信用借了钱，还让他们给我推荐了一个很不错的幽静住处。我的行李还没有到，我告诉他我认为有必要提醒他和房里居住的人相处时要小心，并且解释说我妹妹会来这里和我一起住一段时间，所以我需要两间卧室。 这一点倒很好办，然而麻烦的是鲍尔弗先生在其推荐信中颇为关照地讲了很多细节，但是一句都没有提到还有个什么妹妹之类的。我发现这位荷兰人对此非常怀疑，他从那副大眼镜框上面仔细地审视着我——他身体消瘦、羸弱，让我想起了柔弱的兔子——他开始谨慎地向我询问起来。","There is a garden in that city we were bound to, sanded below with clean sand, the trees meeting overhead, some of them trimmed, some preached, and the whole place beautified with alleys and arbours.Here I left Catriona, and went forward by myself to find my correspondent.There I drew on my credit, and asked to be recommended to some decent, retired lodging.My baggage being not yet arrived, I told him I supposed I should require his caution with the people of the house; and explained that, my sister being come for a while to keep house with me, I should be wanting two chambers.This was all very well; but the trouble was that Mr. Balfour in his letter of recommendation had condescended on a great deal of particulars, and never a word of any sister in the case.I could see my Dutchman was extremely suspicious; and viewing me over the rims of a great pair of spectacles—he was a poor, frail body, and reminded me of an infirm rabbit—he began to question me close."
"这下我惊慌起来了。（我想）假如他相信我编的故事 ，假如他邀我妹妹来住，而且要我带她来。我得好好解开这个错综复杂的谜团才是，否则最后可能会让我和这位少女名誉扫地的。于是我就开始急急忙忙向他详细解释我妹妹的性格。她看起来生性害羞，特别害怕遇见陌生人，而我当时却把她单独留在公共场所。那时，置身于谎言的洪流中，我必须像世界上其他所有处境相同的人那样去做，甚至在这件事上陷得更深。我还增添了一些关于鲍尔弗小姐幼时身体欠佳、隐居在家等不必要的细节。我在谎话连篇之时突然清醒地意识到了自己的行为，于是羞愧得满脸绯红。","Here I fell in a panic.Suppose he accept my tale (thinks I), suppose he invite my sister to his house, and that I bring her.I shall have a fine ravelled pirn to unwind, and may end by disgracing both the lassie and myself.Thereupon I began hastily to expound to him my sister’s character.She was of a bashful disposition, it appeared, and be extremely fearful of meeting strangers that I had left her at that moment sitting in a public place alone.And then, being launched upon the stream of falsehood, I must do like all the rest of the world in the same circumstance, and plunge in deeper than was any service; adding some altogether needless particulars of Miss Balfour’s ill-health and retirement during childhood.In the midst of which I awoke to a sense of my behaviour, and was turned to one blush."
"那位老先生可不是那么容易受骗的，他会发现他是很想打发我离开的。但是，他首先是个生意人，知道我的钱还是个好东西，而这钱又是由我掌控的，于是他很殷勤地派他的儿子给我作向导并提醒我住宿应该注意的问题。这就意味着我要带这位年轻人去见卡特里奥娜。那位可怜、漂亮的女孩休息以后已经精神焕发了。她的神态举止几近完美，她轻松自然地挽起我的胳膊，称呼我为哥哥，我对她的回答还不及她自然。但是也有一点没有做好：因为想着要得到帮助，她对我那位荷兰人的态度太亲切随和了。于是我只能这么认为：鲍尔弗小姐突然长大了，就不再那么害羞了。另外还有一件事就是，我们的语音也不同。我操着低地的乡下口音，而且说话要想好久，而她说的是山地口音，带着一点儿英格兰腔，只不过要悦耳得多，她几乎可以颇为称职地执教英语语法了。所以作为兄妹，我们是最不相称的一对。不过那位年轻的荷兰人真是一个大傻瓜，居然没有打起足够的精神去注意到她的美貌，为此我对他表示鄙视。他一把我们带进房屋，就不管我们了，这样的服务对我们而言倒是更好。","The old gentleman was not so much deceived but what he discovered a willingness to be quit of me.But he was first of all a man of business; and knowing that my money was good enough, however it might be with my conduct, he was so far obliging as to send his son to be my guide and caution in the matter of a lodging.This implied my presenting of the young man to Catriona.The poor, pretty child was much recovered with resting, looked and behaved to perfection, and took my arm and gave me the name of brother more easily than I could answer her.But there was one misfortune: thinking to help, she was rather towardly than otherwise to my Dutchman.And I could not but reflect that Miss Balfour had rather suddenly outgrown her bashfulness.And there was another thing, the difference of our speech.I had the Low Country tongue and dwelled upon my words; she had a hill voice, spoke with something of an English accent, only far more delightful, and was scarce quite fit to be called a deacon in the craft of talking English grammar; so that, for a brother and sister, we made a most uneven pair.But the young Hollander was a heavy dog, without so much spirit in his belly as to remark her prettiness, for which I scorned him.And as soon as he had found a cover to our heads, he left us alone, which was the greater service of the two."
"第二十四章   一册海纳修斯的书的事情始末","CHAPTER XXIV—FULL STORY OF A COPY OF HEINECCIUS"
"我们找到的这个住处在背靠运河的一栋房子的上层。我们有两个房间，第二间要从第一间进去，每间房的地面都建有一个荷兰风格的烟囱，而且每间房靠同一侧都可以从窗口看见我们下面一个小小庭院里的一棵树的顶部，看见一段运河和那些荷兰建筑风格的房屋，以及更远处一座教堂的尖顶。尖顶上挂着一组教堂用钟，能奏出美妙的音乐。只要天晴，阳光就会直照进我们的两个房间。我们可以请附近的一个小酒馆把可口的饭菜送上门。","The place found was in the upper part of a house backed on a canal.We had two rooms, the second entering from the first; each had a chimney built out into the floor in the Dutch manner; and being alongside, each had the same prospect from the window of the top of a tree below us in a little court, of a piece of the canal, and of houses in the Hollands architecture and a church spire upon the further side.A full set of bells hung in that spire and made delightful music; and when there was any sun at all, it shone direct in our two chambers.From a tavern hard by we had good meals sent in."
"第一天晚上我们两个人都很疲惫，特别是卡特里奥娜。我们俩几乎没说什么话，她一吃完饭我就催她去睡觉了。早上我做的第一件事就是给斯普罗特写信，要他把卡特里奥娜的行李转送过来，同时也给住在自己族长处的艾伦写了一行字。把两封信都送走后，给她准备好早餐，我才叫醒了她。当她像往常一样出现在我面前时，看到她的长袜因一路走来沾满了泥浆，我觉得有一点儿惭愧。据我打听到的情况，她的行李似乎还要好几天才能运到莱登，显然她必须换套衣服了。最初她不愿意让我花那笔钱，但是我提醒她说她现在是一位有钱人的妹妹，在有些方面必须显得得体才行。只有当她完全喜欢上所购之物，两眼发亮时，我才会带她去第二家商铺。看见她那么天真可爱而且陶醉于购物的乐趣中，我感到很高兴。更加特别的是我自己居然陷入这样的激情中，总认为我给她买的衣服还不够多或者还不够好，乐此不疲地看她试穿各种不同的服装。事实上，我开始有点儿理解格兰特小姐对服装那么情有独钟了。事实是，当你有理由为一位漂亮的姑娘打扮时，整件事情就变得很美妙了。我得说，荷兰的印花棉布特别物美价廉，可是如果要我写下为她买的长袜花了多少钱，我会觉得很难为情。总之，我为这次愉悦的购物（我是这么称呼的）花了一大笔钱，我为花费太多还惭愧了好一会儿呢。这么出去了一趟，我却任由我们的房间光秃秃的。只要我们有两张床，只要卡特里奥娜打扮得光鲜一点儿，而我有幸可以看见她在身边，我们的寄宿生活对我来说就已经足够丰富了。","The first night we were both pretty weary, and she extremely so.There was little talk between us, and I packed her off to her bed as soon as she had eaten.The first thing in the morning I wrote word to Sprott to have her mails sent on, together with a line to Alan at his chief’s; and had the same despatched, and her breakfast ready, ere I waked her.I was a little abashed when she came forth in her one habit, and the mud of the way upon her stockings.By what inquiries I had made, it seemed a good few days must pass before her mails could come to hand in Leyden, and it was plainly needful she must have a shift of things.She was unwilling at first that I should go to that expense; but I reminded her she was now a rich man’s sister and must appear suitably in the part, and we had not got to the second merchant’s before she was entirely charmed into the spirit of the thing, and her eyes shining.It pleased me to see her so innocent and thorough in this pleasure.What was more extraordinary was the passion into which I fell on it myself; being never satisfied that I had bought her enough or fine enough, and never weary of beholding her in different attires.Indeed, I began to understand some little of Miss Grant’s immersion in the interest of clothes; for the truth is, when you have the ground of a beautiful person to adorn, the whole business becomes beautiful.The Dutch chintzes I should say were extraordinary cheap and fine; but I would be ashamed to set down what I paid for stockings to her.Altogether I spent so great a sum upon this pleasuring (as I may call it) that I was ashamed for a great while to spend more; and by way of a set-off, I left our chambers pretty bare.If we had beds, if Catriona was a little braw, and I had light to see her by, we were richly enough lodged for me."
"购物之行结束后，我高兴地把她和所有购买的东西送回房屋，然后我独自走了很长的一段路对自己进行了反省。现在我已经把一位非常美丽的少女接到我的房子里一起住了，几乎等于是在我的怀抱里，然而她的天真无邪也正是她的危险所在。我与那个荷兰老头的谈话，还有我被迫向他撒的谎都已经让我感觉到了我的行为在别人眼里肯定会是什么样的印象。而现在，在刚刚经历过一阵强烈的钦慕之情和因虚荣而持续的、无节制的购物之后，我开始觉得自己也非常危险了。我扪心自问，要是我真的有一个妹妹，我是否会让她这样抛头露面。我觉得这件事情问题很大，于是我把问题改为：要是把卡特里奥娜交付给任何别的基督徒手里，我是否会这么放心？而该问题的答案让我脸上发烫了。更重要的是：既然我已经陷进而且也使那女孩陷入这么尴尬的情形之中了，我的行为举止就应该非常谨慎周全才是。她的生活起居完全要依靠我，就算我提醒她这种微妙的情感，她也根本无从回避。此外，我既是主人又是她的保护人，我越是不合规矩地处于这样的位置，就越没有理由认为我应该从中得到好处，甚至是从为她提供真正需要的衣服这样的事中得到好处。因为我所享有的这些机会，任何一个明智的家长都不会为此遭受片刻的折磨，更不会觉得连买一套真正需要的衣服都不妥当。我清楚我在处理这种关系时必须尽量保持距离，既不过分亲密也不过于冷淡。因为如果我根本没有权利以求婚者的姿态出现，我就必须不断地，尽可能欣然地以家长的样子出现。显然我应该处事非常老练，这也许是我这个年龄的人难以做到的。但是我已经闯进了也许连天使都害怕踏入的禁区。身在其中，我除了正确行事之外再没有其他出路。我为自己制定了一套行为准则，祈求能使自己有力量去遵行，正如人们为了寻求更多的帮助而基于同样目的去购买法律学习手册一样。这就是我所想到的一切，我从这些严肃的沉思中放松下来，于是我的思绪立刻泛起了欢乐的涟漪，一副飘飘然的样子，我就转身回家了。我一想到家这个称呼，就想起了那位在四面墙之间等候着我的身影，我的心在胸腔怦怦狂跳起来。","By the end of this merchandising I was glad to leave her at the door with all our purchases, and go for a long walk alone in which to read myself a lecture.Here had I taken under my roof, and as good as to my bosom, a young lass extremely beautiful, and whose innocence was her peril.My talk with the old Dutchman, and the lies to which I was constrained, had already given me a sense of how my conduct must appear to others; and now, after the strong admiration I had just experienced and the immoderacy with which I had continued my vain purchases, I began to think of it myself as very hazarded.I bethought me, if I had a sister indeed, whether I would so expose her; then, judging the case too problematical, I varied my question into this, whether I would so trust Catriona in the hands of any other Christian being; the answer to which made my face to burn.The more cause, since I had been entrapped and had entrapped the girl into an undue situation, that I should behave in it with scrupulous nicety.She depended on me wholly for her bread and shelter; in case I should alarm her delicacy, she had no retreat.Besides I was her host and her protector; and the more irregularly I had fallen in these positions, the less excuse for me if I should profit by the same to forward even the most honest suit; for with the opportunities that I enjoyed, and which no wise parent would have suffered for a moment, even the most honest suit would be unfair.I saw I must be extremely hold-off in my relations; and yet not too much so neither; for if I had no right to appear at all in the character of a suitor, I must yet appear continually, and if possible agreeably, in that of host.It was plain I should require a great deal of tact and conduct, perhaps more than my years afforded.But I had rushed in where angels might have feared to tread, and there was no way out of that position save by behaving right while I was in it.I made a set of rules for my guidance; prayed for strength to be enabled to observe them, and as a more human aid to the same end purchased a study-book in law.This being all that I could think of, I relaxed from these grave considerations; whereupon my mind bubbled at once into an effervescency of pleasing spirits, and it was like one treading on air that I turned homeward.As I thought that name of home, and recalled the image of that figure awaiting me between four walls, my heart beat upon my bosom."
"我的种种烦恼随着我回家开始出现。她跑过来迎接我，显然一副兴高采烈的样子。她已经穿戴整齐，而且穿的全部都是我才给她买的新衣服，好看得无法形容。她在我身边走来走去，还给我行了个屈膝礼，以此展示这些新衣服，想获得赞美。我确信我在赞美的时候失了礼数，因为我觉得自己已经窒息，说不出话来了。","My troubles began with my return.She ran to greet me with an obvious and affecting pleasure.She was clad, besides, entirely in the new clothes that I had bought for her; looked in them beyond expression well; and must walk about and drop me curtseys to display them and to be admired.I am sure I did it with an ill grace, for I thought to have choked upon the words."
"“嗯，”她说，“如果你不关心我这些漂亮衣服的话，就来看看我把我们的两间房子收拾得怎么样了吧。”然后她带我看精心打扫好的房间，还有两个壁炉里熊熊燃烧的炉火。","“Well,” she said, “if you will not be caring for my pretty clothes, see what I have done with our two chambers.”And she showed me the place all very finely swept, and the fires glowing in the two chimneys."
"我很高兴有机会能够表现得比我的实际感觉稍微严肃一些。“卡特里奥娜，”我说，“我对你非常不满，你以后再也不准动我的房间。既然我们两个人在这里一起住，其中必须有一个人来制定准则。我既是男人又比你年长，最适合的就应该是我了，而那就是我对你下的命令。”","I was glad of a chance to seem a little more severe than I quite felt.“Catriona,” said I, “I am very much displeased with you, and you must never again lay a hand upon my room.One of us two must have the rule while we are here together; it is most fit it should be I who am both the man and the elder; and I give you that for my command.”"
"她又对我行了个屈膝礼，这次是特别行的礼。 “如果你生气的话，”她说，“我肯定会对你礼貌有加的，戴维。 我会非常听话，因为我应该这样，我身上所穿戴的一线一缕都是属于你的。不过你也不要生很大的气，因为现在我身边再没有别的人了。”","She dropped me one of her curtseys; which were extraordinary taking.“If you will be cross,” said she, “I must be making pretty manners at you, Davie.I will be very obedient, as I should be when every stitch upon all there is of me belongs to you.But you will not be very cross either, because now I have not anyone else.”"
"这番话深深打动了我，而我也有几分后悔，就忙不迭地把我最后说的话所产生的良好效果给抹去了。朝这个方向进展就像下山一样，容易多了。她微笑着引我向前走去。看见她在火光的映照下点头示意、美目流转，我的心完全融化了。我们在无尽的欢乐和柔情中吃了饭，两个人好似融成了一个人，所以我们的笑声听起来无比亲切。","This struck me hard, and I made haste, in a kind of penitence, to blot out all the good effect of my last speech.In this direction progress was more easy, being down hill; she led me forward, smiling; at the sight of her, in the brightness of the fire and with her pretty becks and looks, my heart was altogether melted.We made our meal with infinite mirth and tenderness; and the two seemed to be commingled into one, so that our very laughter sounded like a kindness."
"在此欢笑之际，我突然意识到还有更重要的事情，就找了一个蹩脚的借口，笨拙地开始读书学习去了。我买的是一本有实质意义和教育意义的书，由已故的海纳修斯博士所撰写。我计划在接下来的几天里好好读一读这本书。我时常感到很高兴，因为没有人会问我在读什么书。我想到她对着我微微咬着嘴唇，这让我感到难受。确实我这样会让她异常孤独，再说她是一个读书读得很少的人，还从来没拥有过一本书。可是我又能做什么呢？","In the midst of which I awoke to better recollections, made a lame word of excuse, and set myself boorishly to my studies.It was a substantial, instructive book that I had bought, by the late Dr.Heineccius, in which I was to do a great deal reading these next few days, and often very glad that I had no one to question me of what I read.Methought she bit her lip at me a little, and that cut me.Indeed it left her wholly solitary, the more as she was very little of a reader, and had never a book.But what was I to do?"
"所以那天晚上剩下的时间几乎没有说什么话就过去了。","So the rest of the evening flowed by almost without speech."
"我恨不得揍自己一顿。由于愤怒和后悔，我那天晚上无法入睡，只好光着脚来回踱着步子直到我的脚几乎要冻麻木了，因为炉火已经熄灭，严霜寒冷刺骨。想到她在隔壁房间，想到她可能会听到我的脚步声，回想起我的无礼表现，想起我要么必须继续这种不领情的做法，要么就会丢尽脸面，这一切让我无法理清。我好像在腹背受敌。她到底对我怎么想？我一想到这就心软，继而会感到虚弱无力。有什么事会发生在我们身上？这又使我再一次坚强，去痛下决心。这是我的第一个不眠之夜，内心思想斗争激烈，对此我只好多走路，像疯子一样拼命地踱步，有时就像个幼稚的小男孩一样哭泣，有时则像个基督徒那样祈祷（我真希望如此）。","I could have beat myself.I could not lie in my bed that night for rage and repentance, but walked to and fro on my bare feet till I was nearly perished, for the chimney was gone out and the frost keen.The thought of her in the next room, the thought that she might even hear me as I walked, the remembrance of my churlishness and that I must continue to practise the same ungrateful course or be dishonoured, put me beside my reason.I stood like a man between Scylla and Charybdis: What must she think of me? was my one thought that softened me continually into weakness.What is to become of us? the other which steeled me again to resolution.This was my first night of wakefulness and divided counsels, of which I was now to pass many, pacing like a madman, sometimes weeping like a childish boy, sometimes praying (I fain would hope) like a Christian."
"但是做祷告并不很难，行动起来就难了。她在场时，如果是我先开始表现出亲密，我发现我就很难掌控随后的局面。但是整天和她坐在同一间房屋里，却要假装专心在看海纳修斯的书，那又是我力所不能及的。所以我只好采取权宜之计，就是尽自己最大的可能不呆在家里。我按时出去上课，坐在教室里，却常常不太专心。前几天我在一个笔记本里发现那段时间有套测试题就没有做完，而是在后面写了一篇有教训意义的讲稿，实际上笔记本里还潦草地抄了几句很糟糕的诗。不过我从没有想到我的拉丁文学习掌握得要比我预想的好很多。很不幸，这么做的弊和利几乎一样多。我受考验的时间是少一些了，但我相信，只要随着时间持续下去，我经受的考验会更加严峻。因为她长时间被单独留下，等我回去，她迎接我的时候就越来越热情，这种热情几欲使我乖乖就范。对这些友善的表示，我只能粗暴地予以拒绝，但我的拒绝有时却无情地伤害了她，我只好又放下身段好心地去弥补我给她感情上造成的伤害。所以我们的时光就这样时而开心，时而痛苦，在争执和失望中流逝，我几乎可以说（如果可以说得礼貌一点儿）我已经被钉在十字架上了。","But prayer is not very difficult, and the hitch comes in practice.In her presence, and above all if I allowed any beginning of familiarity, I found I had very little command of what should follow.But to sit all day in the same room with her, and feign to be engaged upon Heineccius, surpassed my strength.So that I fell instead upon the expedient of absenting myself so much as I was able; taking out classes and sitting there regularly, often with small attention, the test of which I found the other day in a note-book of that period, where I had left off to follow an edifying lecture and actually scribbled in my book some very ill verses, though the Latinity is rather better than I thought that I could ever have compassed.The evil of this course was unhappily near as great as its advantage.I had the less time of trial, but I believe, while the time lasted, I was tried the more extremely.For she being so much left to solitude, she came to greet my return with an increasing fervour that came nigh to overmaster me.These friendly offers I must barbarously cast back; and my rejection sometimes wounded her so cruelly that I must unbend and seek to make it up to her in kindness.So that our time passed in ups and downs, tiffs and disappointments, upon the which I could almost say (if it may be said with reverence) that I was crucified."
"我烦恼的根源在于卡特里奥娜特别天真，对此我并不是那么奇怪，而是充满了同情和赞赏。她似乎从来没有想过我们的处境，从来没有感觉到我的种种努力。她对我任何心软的表现都满心欢愉地予以回应，而当我迫不得已再次对自己加以克制时，她又总是不掩饰自己的懊恼。有时我暗自思忖：“要不是她深坠情网，执意想嫁给我的话，她几乎不可能表现得这么殷勤。”于是我会再一次惊讶于女性的单纯，（每逢这种时刻）我都觉得我不值得她屈尊以待。","The base of my trouble was Catriona’s extraordinary innocence, at which I was not so much surprised as filled with pity and admiration.She seemed to have no thought of our position, no sense of my struggles; welcomed any mark of my weakness with responsive joy; and when I was drove again to my retrenchments, did not always dissemble her chagrin.There were times when I have thought to myself, “If she were over head in love, and set her cap to catch me, she would scarce behave much otherwise;” and then I would fall again into wonder at the simplicity of woman, from whom I felt (in these moments) that I was not worthy to be descended."
"所有的事情中，有一点特别能表现出我们之间的冲突，那就是她的衣服的问题。我的行李紧跟着很快就从鹿特丹运了过来，而她的则是从赫尔沃埃特运来的。可以这么说，她现在有两种衣服，我们互相都越来越清楚（我根本说不出是怎么回事），她表示友好时就会穿我给她买的衣服，反之就会穿她自己的衣服。她那是有意在打击我，而且（可以这么说）是在表示她不再心存感激，对此我内心也已经感觉到了，但是我一般很明智，不会表现出已经注意到这种情况。","There was one point in particular on which our warfare turned, and of all things, this was the question of her clothes.My baggage had soon followed me from Rotterdam, and hers from Helvoet.She had now, as it were, two wardrobes; and it grew to be understood between us (I could never tell how) that when she was friendly she would wear my clothes, and when otherwise her own.It was meant for a buffet, and (as it were) the renunciation of her gratitude; and I felt it so in my bosom, but was generally more wise than to appear to have observed the circumstance."
"但是有一次，的确，我自己表现出的那种幼稚比她更为严重。事情是这样的。我下课回来时，一门心思在想着她，满怀无尽的爱恋，此外还有深深的烦恼。这种烦恼开始渐渐淡出我的思绪，这时我在一扇窗户里瞥见了一些插花，荷兰人非常精于此道。我一时冲动就为卡特里奥娜买了一枝。我不知道那枝花的名称，不过那花是粉红色的，而我认为她同样会欣赏，于是满腔柔情蜜意带回家给她。我走的时候她本来穿着我给她的衣服，可是我回去时却发现她已经全换掉了，而且脸色也随之全变了。我从头到脚只看了她一眼，就咬紧牙关，猛然推开窗户，把花给扔到了院子里，随后（在狂怒和谨慎之间）我又冲出房屋，出去时还用力把门给摔上了。","Once, indeed, I was betrayed into a childishness greater than her own; it fell in this way.On my return from classes, thinking upon her devoutly with a great deal of love and a good deal of annoyance in the bargain, the annoyance began to fade away out of my mind; and spying in a window one of those forced flowers, of which the Hollanders are so skilled in the artifice, I gave way to an impulse and bought it for Catriona.I do not know the name of that flower, but it was of the pink colour, and I thought she would admire the same, and carried it home to her with a wonderful soft heart.I had left her in my clothes, and when I returned to find her all changed and a face to match, I cast but the one look at her from head to foot, ground my teeth together, flung the window open, and my flower into the court, and then (between rage and prudence) myself out of that room again, of which I slammed the door as I went out."
"在陡峭的楼梯上我差一点儿绊倒，这让我清醒了过来，于是我立刻开始注意到自己的行为非常愚蠢。我没有按原来的打算到街上去，而是去了房前的庭院，那里一向都很僻静，在那里我看见我买的花（我花的钱远超过它的实际价值）就挂在那棵掉光叶子的树上。我站在运河边上，看着河面上的冰。那些乡下人穿着冰鞋一溜而过，我嫉妒他们。我对于目前所处的困境一筹莫展，也根本没办法返回我刚离开的房间。无疑我内心的情感秘密现在已经全部暴露，而且更为糟糕的是，与此同时我（带着顽童的劣性）还对我那无助的客人表现得很粗野无礼。","On the steep stair I came near falling, and this brought me to myself, so that I began at once to see the folly of my conduct.I went, not into the street as I had purposed, but to the house court, which was always a solitary place, and where I saw my flower (that had cost me vastly more than it was worth) hanging in the leafless tree.I stood by the side of the canal, and looked upon the ice.Country people went by on their skates, and I envied them.I could see no way out of the pickle I was in no way so much as to return to the room I had just left.No doubt was in my mind but I had now betrayed the secret of my feelings; and to make things worse, I had shown at the same time (and that with wretched boyishness) incivility to my helpless guest."
"我想她肯定已经从那扇敞开的窗户看见我了。好像我没有站多久就听到冰冻的雪地上传来了嘎吱嘎吱的脚步声，我有点儿愤怒地转过身（因为我不愿思绪被打断），就看见卡特里奥娜走了过来。她的穿着又全部换回来了，一直到脚上的织花长袜。","I suppose she must have seen me from the open window.It did not seem to me that I had stood there very long before I heard the crunching of footsteps on the frozen snow, and turning somewhat angrily (for I was in no spirit to be interrupted) saw Catriona drawing near.She was all changed again, to the clocked stockings."
"“我们今天不去散步了吗？”她说。","“Are we not to have our walk to-day?” said she."
"我困惑地看着她。“你的胸针到哪里去了？”我说。","I was looking at her in a maze.“Where is your brooch?” says I."
"她把手放在胸前，满面绯红。“我把它给忘记了，”她说，“我会很快跑上楼去拿，然后我们真的会去散步吧？”","She carried her hand to her bosom and coloured high.“I will have forgotten it,” said she.“I will run upstairs for it quick, and then surely we’ll can have our walk?”"
"她最后那句话中恳求的语气让我心意动摇了。我说不出话也发不出声音，只能点点头作为回答。她离开我的时候，我爬上树把花取了下来，而我在她再次返回时又把花献给了她。","There was a note of pleading in that last that staggered me; I had neither words nor voice to utter them; I could do no more than nod by way of answer; and the moment she had left me, climbed into the tree and recovered my flower, which on her return I offered her."
"“我是为你买的花，卡特里奥娜。”我说。","“I bought it for you, Catriona,” said I."
"她用胸针把花别在胸前正中间，我已经可以温和地进行思考了。","She fixed it in the midst of her bosom with the brooch, I could have thought tenderly."
"“这件事我一点都没有处理好。”我又说道，脸也红了。","“It is none the better of my handling,” said I again, and blushed."
"“我还是会好好珍惜它的，对此你尽可以放心。”她说。","“I will be liking it none the worse, you may be sure of that,” said she."
"那天我们没有说太多的话，她似乎想着要含蓄一点儿，尽管并不是不近人情。至于我，在我们散步的时候，到我们回家以后，再到我看着她把我送的花放进装了水的花瓶里，这整段时间里我一直都在暗自思忖，女人真是让人捉摸不透啊！ 我在想，那一刻，要是她还没有察觉到我的爱，那她就是世上最愚蠢的家伙了。跟着我又在想，也许她肯定早就已经察觉到了（作为一个具有女性把握分寸本能的聪明女孩），只是对这一点隐藏不露而已。","We did not speak so much that day; she seemed a thought on the reserve, though not unkindly.As for me, all the time of our walking, and after we came home, and I had seen her put my flower into a pot of water, I was thinking to myself what puzzles women were.I was thinking, the one moment, it was the most stupid thing on earth she should not have perceived my love; and the next, that she had certainly perceived it long ago, and (being a wise girl with the fine female instinct of propriety) concealed her knowledge."
"我们每天都去散步。在外面的街上我觉得更安全，我可以稍微放松一点儿警戒心。首先，这里没有海纳修斯。这样一来这段时间不仅对我自己是一种放松，而且对我那位可怜的女孩来说也特别开心。当我在约定的时间前后回来时，一般我都会发现她早已经穿戴好了，因充满期待而容光焕发。她会尽量延长那段散步的时间，好像害怕（我也一样）回去的时刻。在莱登附近几乎没有一块田野或者河畔，也几乎没有一条街道或者小巷是我们没有漫步徘徊过的。除散步去这些地方之外，我吩咐她一步也不要离开我们的住处。这样做是担心她遇见什么熟人，那就会使我们的处境非常困难。出于同样的担心，我也从不让她去教堂，甚至连我自己都不去。但是我们尽力设法在自己的房间里悄悄地做祷告——我希望自己是很有诚意地在祷告，但是我确信自己已经心猿意马了。实际上，再没有比这更能打动我的了：我们俩跪拜在上帝的面前，就像丈夫和妻子一样。","We had our walk daily.Out in the streets I felt more safe; I relaxed a little in my guardedness; and for one thing, there was no Heineccius.This made these periods not only a relief to myself, but a particular pleasure to my poor child.When I came back about the hour appointed, I would generally find her ready dressed, and glowing with anticipation.She would prolong their duration to the extreme, seeming to dread (as I did myself) the hour of the return; and there is scarce a field or waterside near Leyden, scarce a street or lane there, where we have not lingered.Outside of these, I bade her confine herself entirely to our lodgings; this in the fear of her encountering any acquaintance, which would have rendered our position very difficult.From the same apprehension I would never suffer her to attend church, nor even go myself; but made some kind of shift to hold worship privately in our own chamber—I hope with an honest, but I am quite sure with a very much divided mind.Indeed, there was scarce anything that more affected me, than thus to kneel down alone with her before God like man and wife."
"有一天大雪纷飞。我想我们不可能再冒昧地出去散步了，然而我非常惊讶地发现她已经穿戴整齐在等着我了。","One day it was snowing downright hard.I had thought it not possible that we should venture forth, and was surprised to find her waiting for me ready dressed."
"“不去散步我才不干呢。”她叫道，“戴维，在房子里时，你从来都不是个好男孩。只有到户外我才不用再担心你了。我想我们两个最好变成埃及人，就住在路边算了。”","“I will not be doing without my walk,” she cried.“You are never a good boy, Davie, in the house; I will never be caring for you only in the open air.I think we two will better turn Egyptian and dwell by the roadside.”"
"那天对我们来说是最美好的一次散步了，她在纷纷扬扬的大雪中依偎着我。雪花飘落下来，在我们身上融化，水滴像眼泪一样凝在她光滑的脸颊上，然后滑落进她微笑的嘴角。我似乎浑身充满了力量，样子犹如巨人。我觉得我可能已经追到她了，并且和她一起奔向世界的尽头。真令人难以置信，我们一起一直在谈论着自由和甜蜜。","That was the best walk yet of all of them; she clung near to me in the falling snow; it beat about and melted on us, and the drops stood upon her bright cheeks like tears and ran into her smiling mouth.Strength seemed to come upon me with the sight like a giant’s; I thought I could have caught her up and run with her into the uttermost places in the earth; and we spoke together all that time beyond belief for freedom and sweetness."
"我们走回房门口时已经是深夜了。她把我的手臂放在她的胸前。“非常感谢你给我如此美好的时光。”她说，她的声音很深沉。","It was the dark night when we came to the house door.She pressed my arm upon her bosom.“Thank you kindly for these same good hours,” said she, on a deep note of her voice."
"听闻此言我立刻开始担心起来，赶紧提醒自己要警惕。我们刚一进房间点上灯，她就看到了那位研究海纳修斯的学生露出了那副熟悉、冷峻而坚毅的面容。无疑她比以往受的伤害更大，而我自己也清楚，要继续保持生分也比以往更困难。 甚至在吃饭的时候，我都不敢解开衣扣，也很少抬眼去看她。可是很快我又变回平时的样子，似乎比以前更加心不在焉，理解力也更不如从前。我想，就像我曾经读到过的，我可以听到自己的心跳，就像一座八天才上一次发条的摆钟。虽然我竭力地假装在学习，但我还是有部分眼光透过书页落在卡特里奥娜的身上。她坐在地板上，靠在我的大行李包旁边，炉火照亮了她，在她身上照耀和闪烁着，使她在炉火神奇的光色中忽明忽暗的。她时而凝视着炉火，时而又看看我。见此，我陷入对自己的恐慌中，于是去翻海纳修斯的书页，犹如教堂里在寻找经文的教徒。","The concern in which I fell instantly on this address, put me with the same swiftness on my guard; and we were no sooner in the chamber, and the light made, than she beheld the old, dour, stubborn countenance of the student of Heineccius.Doubtless she was more than usually hurt; and I know for myself, I found it more than usually difficult to maintain any strangeness.Even at the meal, I durst scarce unbuckle and scarce lift my eyes to her; and it was no sooner over than I fell again to my civilian, with more seeming abstraction and less understanding than before.Methought, as I read, I could hear my heart strike like an eight-day clock.Hard as I feigned to study, there was still some of my eyesight that spilled beyond the book upon Catriona.She sat on the floor by the side of my great mail, and the chimney lighted her up, and shone and blinked upon her, and made her glow and darken through a wonder of fine hues.Now she would be gazing in the fire, and then again at me; and at that I would be plunged in a terror of myself, and turn the pages of Heineccius like a man looking for the text in church."
"她突然大声叫喊起来。“哦，为什么我父亲还没有来？”她叫喊着，顿时泪如雨下。","Suddenly she called out aloud.“O, why does not my father come?” she cried, and fell at once into a storm of tears."
"我跳起来，把海纳修斯的书猛然丢进火中，跑向她的身边，伸出一只手臂拥住她抽泣的身体。","I leaped up, flung Heineccius fairly in the fire, ran to her side, and cast an arm around her sobbing body."
"“你不爱你的朋友。”她猛力推开我说，“我也可以很高兴的，只要你想让我高兴！”接着她又说：“哦，我到底做了什么让你这么讨厌我？”","She put me from her sharply, “You do not love your friend,” says she.“I could be so happy too, if you would let me!”And then, “O, what will I have done that you should hate me so?”"
"“讨厌你！”我叫道，紧紧抓着她，“你这个瞎了眼的姑娘，你一点儿也看不见我内心的痛苦吗？难道你不觉得，我坐在那里读我刚烧掉的那本该死的破书时，除了你我一点儿都没有想别的任何事情吗？夜复一夜，我看着你独自一人坐在那里，我心里难受得想哭。但我能做什么？你在这里受到我的尊重，你为此就要惩罚我吗？难道为此你就要抛弃钟爱你的仆人吗？”","“Hate you!” cries I, and held her firm.“You blind less, can you not see a little in my wretched heart?Do you not think when I sit there, reading in that fool-book that I have just burned and be damned to it, I take ever the least thought of any stricken thing but just yourself?Night after night I could have grat to see you sitting there your lone.And what was I to do?You are here under my honour; would you punish me for that?Is it for that that you would spurn a loving servant?”"
"听到这话，她突然轻轻动了一下，就朝我依偎了过来。我把她的脸抬向我，吻了她的脸庞，然后她就埋下头靠在我胸前，紧紧地抱着我。我像个醉汉一样，只觉得眼前一阵天旋地转。随后就听见她声音很小在说话，那声音是蒙在我的衣服里传出来的。","At the word, with a small, sudden motion, she clung near to me.I raised her face to mine, I kissed it, and she bowed her brow upon my bosom, clasping me tight.I saw in a mere whirl like a man drunken.Then I heard her voice sound very small and muffled in my clothes."
"“你真的吻了她吗？”她问。","“Did you kiss her truly?” she asked."
"这一问太出乎我的意料之外了，我感到非常震惊。","There went through me so great a heave of surprise that I was all shook with it."
"“格兰特小姐吗？”我叫道，完全乱了方寸，“是的，我叫她跟我吻别，她就那么做了。”","“Miss Grant?” I cried, all in a disorder.“Yes, I asked her to kiss me good-bye, the which she did.”"
"“啊，好吧！”她说，“不管怎么说，你也已经吻过我了。”","“Ah, well!” said she, “you have kissed me too, at all events.”"
"听到这句既奇怪又甜蜜的话，我明白我们已经陷得太深。我站起身，把她也扶了起来。","At the strangeness and sweetness of that word, I saw where we had fallen; rose, and set her on her feet."
"“这样做真的不行，”我说，“这样做真的、真的不行。哦，卡特琳，卡特琳！”接着我停顿了一下，梗着什么话都说不出来。“去你床上睡觉吧。”我接着说，“去你床上睡觉，去吧。”","“This will never do,” said I.“This will never, never do.O Catrine, Catrine!”Then there came a pause in which I was debarred from any speaking.And then, “Go away to your bed,” said I.“Go away to your bed and leave me.”"
"她像个孩子一样听我的话转过身去了，随后，我知道她又在门口停住了。","She turned to obey me like a child, and the next I knew of it, had stopped in the very doorway."
"“晚安，戴维！”她说。","“Good night, Davie!” said she."
"“哦，晚安，亲爱的！”我叫道，随着内心真挚情感的爆发，我又把她拽向身边，好像都要把她给折断了。接着我使劲把她推出了这间房，用力把门关上，然后独自站着。","“And O, good night, my love!” I cried, with a great outbreak of my soul, and caught her to me again, so that it seemed I must have broken her.The next moment I had thrust her from the room, shut to the door even with violence, and stood alone."
"现在牛奶已经泼出，话已经出口，真情也已告白。我像一个不可靠的男人，已经偷偷爬进了那可怜的少女的情感世界。她在我掌握之中，好像很脆弱、天真，极易得到或者受到伤害。那么是什么防护武器被我给丢了呢？看来似乎是那个海纳修斯的象征，我一直用的防护武器，如今已经被我给烧了。我很后悔，然而在我心里又找不到理由来责备自己犯了这么大的错误。对于她天真的大胆或者刚才她那种哭泣时的诱惑，我似乎都已经无力抵抗了。而且我越是想找借口原谅自己，就使我犯的过错显得越大——我处于这么有利的地位，我好像正是利用了对方的毫无防备啊。","The milk was spilt now, the word was out and the truth told.I had crept like an untrusty man into the poor maid’s affections; she was in my hand like any frail, innocent thing to make or mar; and what weapon of defence was left me?It seemed like a symbol that Heineccius, my old protection, was now burned.I repented, yet could not find it in my heart to blame myself for that great failure.It seemed not possible to have resisted the boldness of her innocence or that last temptation of her weeping.And all that I had to excuse me did but make my sin appear the greater—it was upon a nature so defenceless, and with such advantages of the position, that I seemed to have practised."
"现在我们身上还会发生什么事呢？好像我们不能再住在同一个地方了。可是我又该去哪里呢？或者她又该去哪里呢？我们既没有选择的机会，本身也没有犯过错，然而为生活所逼我们却被困在这么一个狭窄的地方了。我有个疯狂的想法，就是立刻结婚，不过跟着我又打消了这个念头。她还是个孩子，她还不了解自己的内心。我对她的软弱感到惊讶，我绝不能让这种令人惊异的情况发展下去。我必须要保护她，不仅让她不受责备，还要让她自由地来选择我。","What was to become of us now?It seemed we could no longer dwell in the one place.But where was I to go? or where she?Without either choice or fault of ours, life had conspired to wall us together in that narrow place.I had a wild thought of marrying out of hand; and the next moment put it from me with revolt.She was a child, she could not tell her own heart; I had surprised her weakness, I must never go on to build on that surprisal; I must keep her not only clear of reproach, but free as she had come to me."
"我在炉火前坐了下来，一边反省，一边懊悔，不断敲打自己的脑袋苦思摆脱的办法，却徒劳无益。大约凌晨两点的时候，炉火只剩两三点余烬，而这个房间还有整座城市都在沉睡，我察觉到隔壁房间有小声的哭泣声。她以为我睡着了，那可怜的人儿，她为自己的软弱而后悔——或许（上帝帮助她）她会把它称为鲁莽——在夜晚万籁俱寂时，她在用泪水安慰自己。柔情与痛苦，爱恋与忏悔，还有怜悯，都在我心灵深处挣扎，我似乎有责任来安慰她让她不再哭泣。","Down I sat before the fire, and reflected, and repented, and beat my brains in vain for any means of escape.About two of the morning, there were three red embers left and the house and all the city was asleep, when I was aware of a small sound of weeping in the next room.She thought that I slept, the poor soul; she regretted her weakness—and what perhaps (God help her!) she called her forwardness—and in the dead of the night solaced herself with tears.Tender and bitter feelings, love and penitence and pity, struggled in my soul; it seemed I was under bond to heal that weeping."
"“哦，尽力原谅我！”我大声喊道，“尽力、尽力原谅我。让我们忘记一切，如果不能忘记，就让我们尽力去忘记吧！”","“O, try to forgive me!”I cried out, “try, try to forgive me.Let us forget it all, let us try if we’ll no can forget it!”"
"没有传来应答声，但是抽泣声停止了。我说完之后双手十指紧扣，在那里站了很久。随后夜晚的寒气袭来，我不禁浑身打了个寒战，我觉得自己的理性再次觉醒了。","There came no answer, but the sobbing ceased.I stood a long while with my hands still clasped as I had spoken; then the cold of the night laid hold upon me with a shudder, and I think my reason reawakened."
"“你根本就管不了这件事，戴维，”我想，“聪明一点儿就上床睡觉吧，要是能睡着就去试一试。明天你就会知道该怎么办了。”","“You can make no hand of this, Davie,” thinks I.“To bed with you like a wise lad, and try if you can sleep.To-morrow you may see your way.”"
"第二十五章 詹姆斯·莫尔归来","CHAPTER XXV—THE RETURN OF JAMES MORE"
"我很晚入睡而且睡得很不安稳，第二天，一阵敲门声把我叫醒了。我跑去打开门，刹时几欲晕倒，各种矛盾的心情涌上心头，其中主要还是痛苦，因为站在门口的正是詹姆斯·莫尔，他穿着粗糙的拉布拉斯卡尔外套，戴着一顶特别大的镶花边的帽子。","I was called on the morrow out of a late and troubled slumber by a knocking on my door, ran to open it, and had almost swooned with the contrariety of my feelings, mostly painful; for on the threshold, in a rough wraprascal and an extraordinary big laced hat, there stood James More."
"也许如果没有私心杂念，我本应该高兴才对，因为我有种感觉，觉得这个人的到来就像是应验了我们的祈祷一样。我过去一直都在说卡特里奥娜和我是肯定要分开的，说得自己都烦了，而且我一直都在想着让我们分开的办法，想得头都疼了。现在这办法自己用两条腿走来了，可是我心里却怎么也高兴不起来。然而，现在应该这么看，这个人一来，即使未来的重担我可以卸下，目前面临的境况却更黑暗险恶。所以，在我第一次穿着衬衫和裤子站在他面前的时候，我认为我就像个被子弹射中的人一样不由地向后跳了一步。","I ought to have been glad perhaps without admixture, for there was a sense in which the man came like an answer to prayer.I had been saying till my head was weary that Catriona and I must separate, and looking till my head ached for any possible means of separation.Here were the means come to me upon two legs, and joy was the hindmost of my thoughts.It is to be considered, however, that even if the weight of the future were lifted off me by the man’s arrival, the present heaved up the more black and menacing; so that, as I first stood before him in my shirt and breeches, I believe I took a leaping step backward like a person shot."
"“啊，”他说，“我终于找到你了，鲍尔弗先生。”他向我伸出他那双修长的大手，我心存疑虑地握住他的手（同时意识到自己正站在门口的位置，好像带有拒绝他进来的意思）。“我们的事情好像搅在一起了，这太不寻常了。”他继续说，“我应该向你道歉，很遗憾打搅了你的生活，我自己就是因为相信那个口是心非的普雷斯顿格兰奇而陷入其圈套的。要向你承认我居然曾经相信过律师，我都觉得是耻辱。”他耸了耸肩，颇有一种法国式的风格。“但是实际上这个人很会花言巧语。”他说，“现在看起来在我女儿这件事上你也运用得很得心应手，还烦请尊驾告诉我你是受了谁的指点。”","“Ah,” said he, “I have found you, Mr, Balfour.”And offered me his large, fine hand, the which (recovering at the same time my post in the doorway, as if with some thought of resistance) I took him by doubtfully.“It is a remarkable circumstance how our affairs appear to intermingle,” he continued.“I am owing you an apology for an unfortunate intrusion upon yours, which I suffered myself to be entrapped into by my confidence in that false-face, Prestongrange; I think shame to own to you that I was ever trusting to a lawyer.”He shrugged his shoulders with a very French air.“But indeed the man is very plausible,” says he.“And now it seems that you have busied yourself handsomely in the matter of my daughter, for whose direction I was remitted to yourself.”"
"“先生，我想，”我一副很痛苦的样子说道，“我们两个人有必要好好解释一下。”","“I think, sir,” said I, with a very painful air, “that it will be necessary we two should have an explanation.”"
"“没有什么误会吧？”他问，“我的联络人，斯普罗特先生——”","“There is nothing amiss?” he asked.“My agent, Mr. Sprott—”"
"“看在上帝的份上，缓和一下你的语气吧！”我叫道，“我们解释清楚之前不要让她听到。”","“For God’s sake moderate your voice!” I cried.“She must not hear till we have had an explanation.”"
"“她住在这个地方？”他叫道。","“She is in this place?” cries he."
"“那就是她房间的门。”我说。","“That is her chamber door,” said I."
"“你和她单独住在这里？”他问道。","“You are here with her alone?” he asked."
"“我还能叫谁和我们住在一起？”我叫道。","“And who else would I have got to stay with us?” cries I."
"说句公道话，我承认他脸色变白了。","I will do him the justice to admit that he turned pale."
"“这很不寻常，”他说，“这种状况很不寻常。你说对了，我们必须好好解释清楚。”","“This is very unusual,” said he.“This is a very unusual circumstance.You are right, we must hold an explanation.”"
"他这么一边说着一边从我面前走过，而我必须得承认这个高个子的老无赖那一刻倒显得特别有威严。他现在第一次打量了一下我的房间，这一点（可以这么说）是我从他的眼神里观察到的。一缕朝阳闪耀着透过窗户玻璃照射进来，照出了我的床、我的行李包、要洗的碗碟以及有点儿凌乱的衣服，而那个熄了火的壁炉是我房间唯一的设施。房间没什么不好，但是看起来简陋又寒冷，像乞丐住的地方。想到这个地方是给一位年轻女士来栖身，就觉得特别不适合。与此同时，我脑海中回想起了我帮她买的那些衣服，而我觉得这种贫穷和挥霍的鲜明对比会给人留下一种很糟糕的印象。","So saying he passed me by, and I must own the tall old rogue appeared at that moment extraordinary dignified.He had now, for the first time, the view of my chamber, which I scanned (I may say) with his eyes.A bit of morning sun glinted in by the window pane, and showed it off; my bed, my mails, and washing dish, with some disorder of my clothes, and the unlighted chimney, made the only plenishing; no mistake but it looked bare and cold, and the most unsuitable, beggarly place conceivable to harbour a young lady.At the same time came in on my mind the recollection of the clothes that I had bought for her; and I thought this contrast of poverty and prodigality bore an ill appearance."
"他环顾我的房间想找个座，结果发现除了我的床之外他别无地方可坐，他就在床边找个地方坐了下来。我关好门后，也只好和他坐在一起了。无论如何这场特殊的会谈该结束了，这场谈话要尽可能在不吵醒卡特里奥娜的前提下进行，所以一件很有必要的事情就是我们要坐得近而且说话声音要轻。但是我几乎无法想象我们会是怎样的一对。他穿着大衣，和我房间的寒冷倒特别相称，我却穿着衬衫和马裤在瑟瑟发抖；他摆出一幅审判官的架势，而我（不论我看起来像什么）都强烈地感觉到自己就是那个听见最后一声号响的人。","He looked all about the chamber for a seat, and finding nothing else to his purpose except my bed, took a place upon the side of it; where, after I had closed the door, I could not very well avoid joining him.For however this extraordinary interview might end, it must pass if possible without waking Catriona; and the one thing needful was that we should sit close and talk low.But I can scarce picture what a pair we made; he in his great coat which the coldness of my chamber made extremely suitable; I shivering in my shirt and breeks; he with very much the air of a judge; and I (whatever I looked) with very much the feelings of a man who has heard the last trumpet."
"“好了吗？”他说。","“Well?” says he."
"“好了。”我开始说，却发现自己说不下去了。","And “Well,” I began, but found myself unable to go further."
"“你告诉我她在这里？”他又说，但是此刻却有一种不耐烦的口气，这似乎又让我振作起来了。","“You tell me she is here?” said he again, but now with a spice of impatience that seemed to brace me up."
"“她就在这个房子里。”我说，“我知道这种情势是可以称作不寻常。但是你得想一想整件事情从一开始就多么不寻常。有个年轻女士登上了欧洲海岸，身上居然只有两个先令和一个半便士。她按指示去找赫尔沃埃特的那个叫斯普洛特人。我听你称他为你的联络员。我所能说的是，一提到你的名字他除了责备和咒骂其他什么都没做，甚至连代为保管你女儿的行李，我都还必须从自己的口袋里掏钱付给他才行。德拉蒙德先生，这就是你说的不寻常状况，如果你喜欢那样称呼的话。如果你愿意，就是这种处境残忍地摆在她的面前。”","“She is in this house,” said I, “and I knew the circumstance would be called unusual.But you are to consider how very unusual the whole business was from the beginning.Here is a young lady landed on the coast of Europe with two shillings and a penny halfpenny.She is directed to yon man Sprott in Helvoet.I hear you call him your agent.All I can say is he could do nothing but damn and swear at the mere mention of your name, and I must fee him out of my own pocket even to receive the custody of her effects.You speak of unusual circumstances, Mr. Drummond, if that be the name you prefer.Here was a circumstance, if you like, to which it was barbarity to have exposed her.”"
"“但是有一点我实在不明白，”詹姆斯说，“我女儿本来托付给一些可靠的人了，我把他们的名字给忘记了。”“这人的名字叫格比。”我说，“无疑格比先生本来应该陪她在赫尔沃埃特上岸的。但是他没有上岸，德拉蒙德先生，而我认为你可以感谢主，因为我当时提出了代替他的位置。”","“But this is what I cannot understand the least,” said James.“My daughter was placed into the charge of some responsible persons, whose names I have forgot.”“Gebbie was the name,” said I; “and there is no doubt that Mr. Gebbie should have gone ashore with her at Helvoet.But he did not, Mr. Drummond; and I think you might praise God that I was there to offer in his place.”"
"“不久我就会捎话给格比先生的。”他说，“至于你自己，我想对于承担这样的一个重任来说，也许你还是有点儿太年轻了。”","“I shall have a word to say to Mr. Gebbie before long,” said he.“As for yourself, I think it might have occurred that you were somewhat young for such a post.”"
"“但是当时并不是除了我之外还有别的人可以选择，而是除我之外就没有人愿意承担这个责任了。”我叫道，“没有人愿意代替我的位置，而我必须得说我觉得你对我所做的一切几乎没有表现出一点儿感激之情。”","“But the choice was not between me and somebody else, it was between me and nobody,” cried I.“Nobody offered in my place, and I must say I think you show a very small degree of gratitude to me that did.”"
"“我要等我更详细地了解清楚我欠的人情以后再说。”他说。","“I shall wait until I understand my obligation a little more in the particular,” says he."
"“确实，我觉得从你的表情就看得出来。”我说，“你的孩子为人所弃，她在欧洲就被人彻底给抛弃了，身上只有不到两个先令，当地的语言也说不出两句。我不得不说这件事情做得真好啊！我把她带到了这个地方。我给了她妹妹的名分和温情。所有这一切不花钱是办不成的，但是我几乎不需要任何暗示。做这些事情是因为我尊重这位年轻女士的人品，而且我也认为这是一件美事，如果我想在她父亲面前赞美她的话。”","“Indeed, and I think it stares you in the face, then,” said I.“Your child was deserted, she was clean flung away in the midst of Europe, with scarce two shillings, and not two words of any language spoken there: I must say, a bonny business!I brought her to this place.I gave her the name and the tenderness due to a sister.All this has not gone without expense, but that I scarce need to hint at.They were services due to the young lady’s character which I respect; and I think it would be a bonny business too, if I was to be singing her praises to her father.”"
"“你是个年轻人。”他开始说。","“You are a young man,” he began."
"“我听到你这么告诉我了。”我说，感觉很生气。","“So I hear you tell me,” said I, with a good deal of heat."
"“你是个非常年轻的人，”他重复道，“或者说你应该已经明白这么做的重要性了。”","“You are a very young man,” he repeated, “or you would have understood the significancy of the step.”"
"“我觉得你说的太轻巧了吧。”我叫道，“那我该怎么做？ 其实，我本可以雇一个体面而贫穷的女人作为第三个人加入我们当中的，不过我要声明在此之前我从来就没有这么想过！但是我要到哪里去找这么个女人？我自己都还是个外国人呢。德拉蒙德先生，对你的看法我要指出的是，那样还是要我掏腰包花钱的。因为现在我正是这样做的，我不得不为你的疏忽而付出代价。对此只能说明一个事实，那就是你太没有爱心，太粗心，所以连女儿都给弄丢了。”","“I think you speak very much at your ease,” cried I.“What else was I to do?It is a fact I might have hired some decent, poor woman to be a third to us, and I declare I never thought of it until this moment!But where was I to find her, that am a foreigner myself?And let me point out to your observation, Mr. Drummond, that it would have cost me money out of my pocket.For here is just what it comes to, that I had to pay through the nose for your neglect; and there is only the one story to it, just that you were so unloving and so careless as to have lost your daughter.”"
"“家住玻璃屋，不可乱抛石。”他说，“我们弄清楚德拉蒙德小姐的行为之后再坐下来评判她的父亲吧。”","“He that lives in a glass house should not be casting stones,” says he; “and we will finish inquiring into the behaviour of Miss Drummond before we go on to sit in judgment on her father.”"
"“不过我才不会上当相信你这样的态度呢。”我说，“德拉蒙德小姐的人品根本不用质疑，这一点她的父亲应该知道。我的人品也一样清白，我要告诉你这一点。只有两种方法供你选择。一种就是像一个绅士对待另一个绅士那样来向我表达你的谢意，其他就不再多说。另一种（如果你觉得难办，还不满意的话）就是把我所花的钱还给我，这事就此了结。”","“But I will be entrapped into no such attitude,” said I.“The character of Miss Drummond is far above inquiry, as her father ought to know.So is mine, and I am telling you that.There are but the two ways of it open.The one is to express your thanks to me as one gentleman to another, and to say no more.The other (if you are so difficult as to be still dissatisfied) is to pay me, that which I have expended and be done.”"
"他一只手举在空中，似乎想让我平静下来。“你看，你看，”他说，“你结论下得未免太快了，你结论下得未免太快了，鲍尔弗先生。我学会了更耐心，这倒是一件好事情。不过我相信你忘记了我还没有见到我女儿呢。”","He seemed to soothe me with a hand in the air.“There, there,” said he.“You go too fast, you go too fast, Mr. Balfour.It is a good thing that I have learned to be more patient.And I believe you forget that I have yet to see my daughter.”"
"我开始对他的话放心了一点儿，而我发觉我一提到我们之间的钱的问题时，这家伙的态度也发生了变化。","I began to be a little relieved upon this speech and a change in the man’s manner that I spied in him as soon as the name of money fell between us."
"“我在想这样会更合适——如果你肯原谅我在你面前穿得太随便的话——我出去，你跟她单独见面？”我说。","“I was thinking it would be more fit—if you will excuse the plainness of my dressing in your presence—that I should go forth and leave you to encounter her alone?” said I."
"“我很乐意听从你的安排！”他说，他所说的话很礼貌，没有一点儿不当。","“What I would have looked for at your hands!” says he; and there was no mistake but what he said it civilly."
"我觉得情况还是越来越好了，然后我在开始穿紧身裤时，想起了这个家伙在普雷斯顿格兰奇家那副厚颜无耻的乞丐嘴脸，我决定去追逐似乎属于我的胜利。","I thought this better and better still, and as I began to pull on my hose, recalling the man’s impudent mendicancy at Prestongrange’s, I determined to pursue what seemed to be my victory."
"“如果你有心在莱登呆上一段时间的话，”我说，“这个房间就任由你支配好了，我很容易给自己另找一个住的地方。这样的话，我们就可以尽可能少搬东西，只需要一个人换换地方就行了。”","“If you have any mind to stay some while in Leyden,” said I, “this room is very much at your disposal, and I can easy find another for myself: in which way we shall have the least amount of flitting possible, there being only one to change.”"
"“为什么，先生，”他说，作出胸襟宽大的样子，“我认为我是为国王效劳而贫穷的，这并不可耻。我毫不隐瞒地告诉你我的事情牵涉太多，目前我甚至都不可能完成我的旅程。”","“Why, sir,” said he, making his bosom big, “I think no shame of a poverty I have come by in the service of my king; I make no secret that my affairs are quite involved; and for the moment, it would be even impossible for me to undertake a journey.”"
"“到你有机会和你的朋友们沟通此事的时候吧，”我说，“如果你把自己看成是我的客人的话，也许对你可能更方便吧（当然这对于我本人也是一件荣幸的事情）？”","“Until you have occasion to communicate with your friends,” said I, “perhaps it might be convenient for you (as of course it would be honourable to myself) if you were to regard yourself in the light of my guest?”"
"“先生，”他说，“既然你这么坦诚地提出帮助，我认为我也特别以自己能效仿这种坦诚为荣。你的帮助，戴维先生，你有这种我最尊重的品格。你属于那种能给绅士以帮助却从不多说一句话的人。我是一个老兵了，”他说，一副很厌恶的样子环顾着我的房间，“你不必担心我会成为你的累赘。我经常在堤边吃饭，在沟里喝水，而且下雨天都没地方遮雨的。”","“Sir,” said he, “when an offer is frankly made, I think I honour myself most to imitate that frankness.Your hand, Mr. David; you have the character that I respect the most; you are one of those from whom a gentleman can take a favour and no more words about it.I am an old soldier,” he went on, looking rather disgusted-like around my chamber, “and you need not fear I shall prove burthensome.I have ate too often at a dyke-side, drank of the ditch, and had no roof but the rain.”"
"“我正要告诉你，”我说，“我们的早餐通常是早晨这个时候送过来。我打算现在就去那个小酒馆，吩咐他们再给你加一份早餐，并且推迟一个小时再送餐，这样好给你空出点儿时间和你女儿见面。”","“I should be telling you,” said I, “that our breakfasts are sent customarily in about this time of morning.I propose I should go now to the tavern, and bid them add a cover for yourself and delay the meal the matter of an hour, which will give you an interval to meet your daughter in.”"
"据我看来，听到这话时他鼓了鼓鼻孔。“哦，一个小时，”他说，“那也许太久了。就半个小时吧，鲍尔弗先生，或者说就二十分钟。我会在这段时间把一切处理好的。顺便问一句，”他补充说，拉住我的外套拦着我，“你早晨都喝些什么，是麦芽酒还是葡萄酒？”","Methought his nostrils wagged at this.“O, an hour” says he.“That is perhaps superfluous.Half an hour, Mr. David, or say twenty minutes; I shall do very well in that.And by the way,” he adds, detaining me by the coat, “what is it you drink in the morning, whether ale or wine?”"
"“坦率地告诉你，先生，”我说，“除了少量的冷水我什么都不喝。”","“To be frank with you, sir,” says I, “I drink nothing else but spare, cold water.”"
"“啧，啧，”他说，“那会对胃有很大损害的，要记住一位老战士的话。我们家乡的烈酒也许是最有益健康的了，不过那是这里找不到的，所以退而求其次，就喝莱茵白葡萄酒或者一种勃艮第白葡萄酒吧。”","“Tut-tut,” says he, “that is fair destruction to the stomach, take an old campaigner’s word for it.Our country spirit at home is perhaps the most entirely wholesome; but as that is not come-at-able, Rhenish or a white wine of Burgundy will be next best.”"
"“我会视为己责，确保能给你提供。”我说。","“I shall make it my business to see you are supplied,” said I."
"“哎呀，很好，”他说，“戴维先生，你可真不失为一个男子汉。”","“Why, very good,” said he, “and we shall make a man of you yet, Mr. David.”"
"至此，可以说我的心思根本不在他身上，倒是有种匪夷所思的想法，觉得他好像在证明他是我的岳父。我全部的注意力都集中在他的女儿身上，我决定对她传递信息，警示她有客来访。因此，我走到门边，一边在门上敲着，一边透过门上的窗格喊道：“德拉蒙德小姐，现在你父亲终于来了。”","By this time, I can hardly say that I was minding him at all, beyond an odd thought of the kind of father-in-law that he was like to prove; and all my cares centred about the lass his daughter, to whom I determined to convey some warning of her visitor.I stepped to the door accordingly, and cried through the panels, knocking thereon at the same time: “Miss Drummond, here is your father come at last.”"
"随后我就出去办我的事，却（因为这两句话）把我自己的好事给破坏得一塌糊涂了。","With that I went forth upon my errand, having (by two words) extraordinarily damaged my affairs."
"第二十六章 三人行","CHAPTER XXVI—THE THREESOME"
"我是否应该受这么多的责备，也许更应该说是否应该接受同情，我都只能留待他人去评价了。我的机敏（我也是非常机敏之辈）似乎对女士没有那么有效。毫无疑问，在我唤醒她的那一刻，我就在想这件事会给詹姆斯·莫尔留下强烈的印象。同样的，等我回来和大家一起坐下来吃早餐时，我还是对那位年轻女士保持着尊重和距离。我认为这是我做的最明智的一件事。她的父亲曾经怀疑过我对她的友谊是否清白，所以我首先要做的事情就是消除其怀疑。但是卡特里奥娜也有她的理由。 我们曾分享过那温存和激情的一幕，也曾互相给予并得到过爱抚：我曾经粗暴地把她从我身边推开，也曾在夜晚从一间房向另一间房大声地呼唤她；她曾经历几个小时的失眠和哭泣，可以想见她伏枕夜思中从未缺过我的身影。回想到此，我惊醒过来，依着很不习惯的拘谨礼节称呼她为德拉蒙德小姐，而且自那以后我都对她保持很大的距离，相当尊重，结果使她完全错误地理解了我的个人感情。她确实受到了令人难以置信的伤害，居然以为我觉得后悔了，在试图打退堂鼓了！","Whether or not I was to be so much blamed, or rather perhaps pitied, I must leave others to judge.My shrewdness (of which I have a good deal, too) seems not so great with the ladies.No doubt, at the moment when I awaked her, I was thinking a good deal of the effect upon James More; and similarly when I returned and we were all sat down to breakfast, I continued to behave to the young lady with deference and distance; as I still think to have been most wise.Her father had cast doubts upon the innocence of my friendship; and these, it was my first business to allay.But there is a kind of an excuse for Catriona also.We had shared in a scene of some tenderness and passion, and given and received caresses: I had thrust her from me with violence; I had called aloud upon her in the night from the one room to the other; she had passed hours of wakefulness and weeping; and it is not to be supposed I had been absent from her pillow thoughts.Upon the back of this, to be awaked, with unaccustomed formality, under the name of Miss Drummond, and to be thenceforth used with a great deal of distance and respect, led her entirely in error on my private sentiments; and she was indeed so incredibly abused as to imagine me repentant and trying to draw off!"
"我们之间的问题似乎在于这一点：虽然我（自从第一眼看到他的大帽子起）一门心思只想着詹姆斯·莫尔、他的归来和他的怀疑，但是卡特里奥娜几乎没有感觉到这些，我都可以说她根本就没有注意到。她所有的烦恼和行为都和我们之间前一天晚上所发生的事情有关。这一方面可以解释为她性格单纯而大胆，另一方面则是因为詹姆斯·莫尔在和我会面时太过仓促，或者是我的邀请堵住了他的嘴，他还没和她女儿谈起这件事。因此，吃早餐的时候，很快就显出我们的意见相左了。我本来希望她穿她自己的衣服，却发现她（好像把她父亲给忘记了）穿着我给她买的最漂亮的衣服，而她知道（或者认为）我是很欣赏她穿这套衣服的。我本来指望能看到她模仿我，对感情保持距离，而且做得既很到位又很正式。相反，我却发现她脸带红晕、透着野性，双眸明亮异常，而且带着一副痛苦而多变的神情。她语气温柔地呼唤着我的名字，就像一位担心而多疑的妻子在询问并顺从着我的想法和意愿。","The trouble betwixt us seems to have been this: that whereas I (since I had first set eyes on his great hat) thought singly of James More, his return and suspicions, she made so little of these that I may say she scarce remarked them, and all her troubles and doings regarded what had passed between us in the night before.This is partly to be explained by the innocence and boldness of her character; and partly because James More, having sped so ill in his interview with me, or had his mouth closed by my invitation, said no word to her upon the subject.At the breakfast, accordingly, it soon appeared we were at cross purposes.I had looked to find her in clothes of her own: I found her (as if her father were forgotten) wearing some of the best that I had bought for her, and which she knew (or thought) that I admired her in.I had looked to find her imitate my affectation of distance, and be most precise and formal; instead I found her flushed and wild-like, with eyes extraordinary bright, and a painful and varying expression, calling me by name with a sort of appeal of tenderness, and referring and deferring to my thoughts and wishes like an anxious or a suspected wife."
"但这并没有持续多久。因为我看见她竟然毫不顾及自己的种种利害关系，那可是我曾经危及而现在正在尽力补救的，所以我对她加倍冷淡，以作为给这个女孩的一点教训。她越是向前靠近，我就向后退得越远；她越是暴露我们之间的亲密程度，我就越发刻意保持礼貌。直到后来连她父亲（如果他不是全神贯注大吃特吃的话）也许都注意到了我们之间这种截然相反的表现。在这期间，她突然彻底改变了态度，于是我大大地松了口气，告诉自己，她终于接受我的暗示了。","But this was not for long.As I behold her so regardless of her own interests, which I had jeopardised and was now endeavouring to recover, I redoubled my own coldness in the manner of a lesson to the girl.The more she came forward, the farther I drew back; the more she betrayed the closeness of our intimacy, the more pointedly civil I became, until even her father (if he had not been so engrossed with eating) might have observed the opposition.In the midst of which, of a sudden, she became wholly changed, and I told myself, with a good deal of relief, that she had took the hint at last."
"我整天都在上课，或者在找新的住处。虽然我们惯常散步的时间只能悲惨地被我慢慢打发掉，但我还是得承认总体上我还是很高兴的。我的道路已经扫清，那位女孩已经再次得到合适的保护，那位父亲还感到满意或者至少已经接受了，而我自己则可以自由地、有尊严地把我的爱进行到底。吃晚饭的时候，正如我们每餐吃饭时一样，又是詹姆斯·莫尔在说话。只要还有人可以相信他，毫无疑问，他讲起来头头是道。不过我跟着就会更为详细地谈到他。吃完饭，他站起身，穿上他的长大衣，看着我（就像我想的那样），说他有事要外出。我认为这是在暗示我也要走，于是我就站起身来。那位女孩在我进门时几乎没有跟我打过招呼，这时却转眼看着我，眼睛睁得大大的在示意恳求我留下。我站在他们中间，就像一条出了水的鱼一样，转身看看这个又看看那个。两个人好像都没看见我，她盯着地面，而他在扣大衣，这让我尴尬到了极点。这种满不在乎的样子在她这边意味着满腔的怒火就要爆发。他那边，我觉得也让人非常担忧。我确信一场暴风雨即将来临。考虑到主要的危险会在他那里，我转向他，把自己（可以说）交由他安排了。","All day I was at my classes or in quest of my new lodging; and though the hour of our customary walk hung miserably on my hands, I cannot say but I was happy on the whole to find my way cleared, the girl again in proper keeping, the father satisfied or at least acquiescent, and myself free to prosecute my love with honour.At supper, as at all our meals, it was James More that did the talking.No doubt but he talked well if anyone could have believed him.But I will speak of him presently more at large.The meal at an end, he rose, got his great coat, and looking (as I thought) at me, observed he had affairs abroad.I took this for a hint that I was to be going also, and got up; whereupon the girl, who had scarce given me greeting at my entrance, turned her eyes upon me wide open with a look that bade me stay.I stood between them like a fish out of water, turning from one to the other; neither seemed to observe me, she gazing on the floor, he buttoning his coat: which vastly swelled my embarrassment.This appearance of indifference argued, upon her side, a good deal of anger very near to burst out.Upon his, I thought it horribly alarming; I made sure there was a tempest brewing there; and considering that to be the chief peril, turned towards him and put myself (so to speak) in the man’s hands."
"“德拉蒙德先生，我能为您做点什么？”我说。","“Can I do anything for you, Mr. Drummond?” says I."
"他憋住了一个哈欠，我再次觉得这他这是在装样子。“哎呀，戴维先生，”他说，“既然你那么好心提出帮忙，那就不妨带我去某某酒馆（他给了我酒馆的名称），我希望到那里去和一些老战友相会。”","He stifled a yawn, which again I thought to be duplicity.“Why, Mr. David,” said he, “since you are so obliging as to propose it, you might show me the way to a certain tavern” (of which he gave the name) “where I hope to fall in with some old companions in arms.”"
"没有再说什么，我就拿起帽子和披风，准备陪他前往。","There was no more to say, and I got my hat and cloak to bear him company."
"“至于你，”他对他的女儿说，“你最好上床睡觉去。我会回来很晚，‘早睡早起，美丽的姑娘眼睛亮’。”","“And as for you,” say he to his daughter, “you had best go to your bed.I shall be late home, and Early to bed and early to rise, gars bonny lasses have bright eyes.”"
"于是他非常温柔地吻了她，然后让我走在他前面先出门。 这件事就这么结束了（正是我的意图），几乎不可能再说什么告别的话，但我注意到她没有看我，我以为那是因为她害怕詹姆斯·莫尔。","Whereupon he kissed her with a good deal of tenderness, and ushered me before him from the door.This was so done (I thought on purpose) that it was scarce possible there should be any parting salutation; but I observed she did not look at me, and set it down to terror of James More."
"到那个酒馆还有一段距离。他一路上说的事情我一点都不感兴趣，到酒馆门口以后他说了些客套话就把我打发走了。随后我就走向我的新住处，那里没有炉火让我取暖，也没有人与我交往，只有我自己的种种思绪。我的思绪还是很清晰的，但是我远没有料到卡特里奥娜会转过来针对我。我觉得我们俩已经互盟誓约，我觉得我们曾经过于亲昵、言语热烈，很难把我们分开，但是至少保持那么几步的距离是非常必要的策略。我主要关心的就是我的这个准岳父是个什么样的人，但是他根本就不是我愿意选择的那种人。至于我最快应该什么时候对他说这件事，这一点很微妙，得多方考虑。首先，每当我一想到自己还太年轻，我就会急得满脸通红，几乎觉得自己内心都要打消这个念头了。只是一旦我没有加以解释就让他们离开莱登的话，也许我就会彻底失去她了。其次，我们这种很不合规矩的情形已经被看见了，而且那天早晨我并没有给詹姆斯·莫尔一个满意的解决方案。我得出结论，总体看来，拖延不会有任何损害，但是我也不会拖延太久。随后我就心满意足地爬上了我那冰冷的床。","It was some distance to that tavern.He talked all the way of matters which did not interest me the smallest, and at the door dismissed me with empty manners.Thence I walked to my new lodging, where I had not so much as a chimney to hold me warm, and no society but my own thoughts.These were still bright enough; I did not so much as dream that Catriona was turned against me; I thought we were like folk pledged; I thought we had been too near and spoke too warmly to be severed, least of all by what were only steps in a most needful policy.And the chief of my concern was only the kind of father-in-law that I was getting, which was not at all the kind I would have chosen: and the matter of how soon I ought to speak to him, which was a delicate point on several sides.In the first place, when I thought how young I was I blushed all over, and could almost have found it in my heart to have desisted; only that if once I let them go from Leyden without explanation, I might lose her altogether.And in the second place, there was our very irregular situation to be kept in view, and the rather scant measure of satisfaction I had given James More that morning.I concluded, on the whole, that delay would not hurt anything, yet I would not delay too long neither; and got to my cold bed with a full heart."
"第二天，因为詹姆斯·莫尔似乎对我房间的简陋略有抱怨，所以我就提出多添置一些家具。下午随搬运工一起搬着桌椅过来时，我发现那个女孩又是独自留在那里。她很客气地招呼我进去，但很快就缩回自己的房间，还把房门给关上了。我布置好家具，然后付钱把那些人打发走了，这样她可以听见他们走了。我想她会立刻再次出来和我讲话。我还是等了一会儿，然后才去敲她的房门。","The next day, as James More seemed a little on the complaining hand in the matter of my chamber, I offered to have in more furniture; and coming in the afternoon, with porters bringing chairs and tables, found the girl once more left to herself.She greeted me on my admission civilly, but withdrew at once to her own room, of which she shut the door.I made my disposition, and paid and dismissed the men so that she might hear them go, when I supposed she would at once come forth again to speak to me.I waited yet awhile, then knocked upon her door."
"“卡特里奥娜！”我叫道。","“Catriona!” said I."
"我话音未落，门就马上打开了，我觉得她肯定就站在门后听。她一动不动地在那里站了一会儿，但是她的眼睛有一种难以名状的神情，像是非常苦恼。","The door was opened so quickly, even before I had the word out, that I thought she must have stood behind it listening.She remained there in the interval quite still; but she had a look that I cannot put a name on, as of one in a bitter trouble."
"“我们今天也不去散步了吗？”我支支吾吾地问道。","“Are we not to have our walk to-day either?” so I faltered."
"“我谢谢你了。”她说，“既然我父亲已经回家，我就没有那么多心思散步了。”","“I am thanking you,” said she.“I will not be caring much to walk, now that my father is come home.”"
"“可是我想他已经出去了，只留下你一个人在这里。”我说。","“But I think he has gone out himself and left you here alone,” said I."
"“你认为这么说让人听着舒服吗？”她问。","“And do you think that was very kindly said?” she asked."
"“我并没有恶意，”我回答说，“什么事情让你苦恼，卡特里奥娜？我对你做了什么，你就这么不理我了？”","“It was not unkindly meant,” I replied.“What ails you, Catriona?What have I done to you that you should turn from me like this?”"
"“我根本就没有不理你。”她很小心地说道，“我会永远感激曾经善待过我的朋友，我将尽我所能去做他的朋友。 不过现在我父亲詹姆斯·莫尔又回来了，情况就不一样了，所以我想有些说过的话、做过的事最好还是忘记吧。我将尽我所能做你的朋友，如果那样还不够尽全力……如果那样尽的力还不够多……那也不劳你费心！我是不会让你为我考虑过多的。你对我说过的话是对的，我还太年轻，接受不了忠告，而我希望你会记住我只不过是个孩子。无论如何，我不愿意失去你的友谊。”","“I do not turn from you at all,” she said, speaking very carefully.“I will ever be grateful to my friend that was good to me; I will ever be his friend in all that I am able.But now that my father James More is come again, there is a difference to be made, and I think there are some things said and done that would be better to be forgotten.But I will ever be your friend in all that I am able, and if that is not all that...if it is not so much...Not that you will be caring!But I would not have you think of me too hard.It was true what you said to me, that I was too young to be advised, and I am hoping you will remember I was just a child.I would not like to lose your friendship, at all events.”"
"她开始说这话的时候脸色苍白，但是她的话还没有说完，血色上涌，她就满脸通红了。因此，不只是她说的话，还有她的脸色以及她颤抖的双手，都让我心软了下来。我第一次意识到，我真是大错特错了，居然让这个孩子处于这样的境地，害她陷入了一时的软弱，现在站在我的面前像一个蒙受了羞辱的人。","She began this very pale; but before she was done, the blood was in her face like scarlet, so that not her words only, but her face and the trembling of her very hands, besought me to be gentle.I saw, for the first time, how very wrong I had done to place the child in that position, where she had been entrapped into a moment’s weakness, and now stood before me like a person shamed."
"“德拉蒙德小姐，”我说，然后就卡壳了， 于是我只好再一次从头开始说，“我希望你能读懂我的心，”我叫道，“你会察觉到我对你的尊重没有减少。如果可能的话，应该说我对你的尊重还增加了。这只不过是我们所犯的错误造成的结果，既然结果已经如此，现在还是说得越少越好。 关于我们在这里生活的一切，我向你保证我永远不会透露半个字，我还可以向你保证我永远也不会再去想它，不过这对我来说是一份永远珍贵的回忆。至于说朋友，你在这里有一位甘愿为你牺牲生命的朋友。”","“Miss Drummond,” I said, and stuck, and made the same beginning once again, “I wish you could see into my heart,” I cried.“You would read there that my respect is undiminished.If that were possible, I should say it was increased.This is but the result of the mistake we made; and had to come; and the less said of it now the better.Of all of our life here, I promise you it shall never pass my lips; I would like to promise you too that I would never think of it, but it’s a memory that will be always dear to me.And as for a friend, you have one here that would die for you.”"
"“我谢谢你了。”她说。","“I am thanking you,” said she."
"我们默默地站了一会儿，而我自己内心的悲伤开始占据上风，因为我一切的梦想可悲地失落了，我的爱已失去，就像最初那样，又只剩下我一个人孤独地在这个世界上了。","We stood awhile silent, and my sorrow for myself began to get the upper hand; for here were all my dreams come to a sad tumble, and my love lost, and myself alone again in the world as at the beginning."
"“好吧，”我说，“我们永远都会是朋友，这一点是肯定的。但这也是一种告别：它毕竟是一种告别。我永远都会认识德拉蒙德小姐，但这却是我与我的卡特里奥娜的告别。”","“Well,” said I, “we shall be friends always, that’s a certain thing.But this is a kind of farewell, too: it’s a kind of a farewell after all; I shall always ken Miss Drummond, but this is a farewell to my Catriona.”"
"我看着她，与其说我看清楚她了，不如说在我的眼里她似乎变得高大了，更加光彩照人了。我想我当时肯定是失去理智了，因为我再一次大声喊着她的名字，向她迈了一步并伸出了双手。","I looked at her; I could hardly say I saw her, but she seemed to grow great and brighten in my eyes; and with that I suppose I must have lost my head, for I called out her name again and made a step at her with my hands reached forth."
"她像是受到了惊吓，直往后退缩，她的脸绯红。血液刚一涌上她的脸颊，我就不禁急血攻心，因为见此情景，我颇感忏悔和担忧。我无法为自己找到托辞，只好在她面前深深鞠了个躬，然后万念俱灰地走出了房间。","She shrank back like a person struck, her face flamed; but the blood sprang no faster up into her cheeks, than what it flowed back upon my own heart, at sight of it, with penitence and concern.I found no words to excuse myself, but bowed before her very deep, and went my ways out of the house with death in my bosom."
"我觉得随后大约五天都没有什么变化。我只有吃饭时偶尔见到她，当然那时会有詹姆斯·莫尔在旁。如果我们单独相处，哪怕是片刻，我都注意保持相当的距离，对她敬重有加，因为我脑海中总是浮现出这位女孩畏缩的神情、涨红的脸庞，我内心对她怜惜有加，无法用语言形容。我为自己感到难过，我没必要老是想着那一点的，因为我立刻就竭力补救了，只是力所不能及而已。不过事实上，我也替那位女孩难过，所以除偶尔那么几次，我很少对她发脾气了。她的辩解说得很好，她已经被置于不公正的境地。如果她欺骗了她自己和我的话，那也只不过是不得已而为之罢了。","I think it was about five days that followed without any change.I saw her scarce ever but at meals, and then of course in the company of James More.If we were alone even for a moment, I made it my devoir to behave the more distantly and to multiply respectful attentions, having always in my mind’s eye that picture of the girl shrinking and flaming in a blush, and in my heart more pity for her than I could depict in words.I was sorry enough for myself, I need not dwell on that, having fallen all my length and more than all my height in a few seconds; but, indeed, I was near as sorry for the girl, and sorry enough to be scarce angry with her save by fits and starts.Her plea was good; she had been placed in an unfair position; if she had deceived herself and me, it was no more than was to have been looked for."
"而另一方面，她现在非常非常孤独。她父亲在她身边的时候倒也不失为一位亲切的家长，但他时常要出去处理自己的种种事情，加上还要寻欢作乐，所以他就会毫不愧疚或者毫不注意地就把她给忽视了。他一有钱就在酒店过夜，次数多得我都数不清楚了。甚至就在这几天，他有一次就没有赶回来吃饭，最后他没有在，只好就我和卡特里奥娜两个人一起吃的饭。那是一次晚饭，我一吃完饭就赶紧离开了，我想她宁可单独呆着，对此她表示同意（尽管看起来有些奇怪），但我很相信她。实际上，我觉得自己只不过是那位女孩的眼中钉，时刻在提醒着她曾经一度软弱过，而这是她极不愿意想起的。所以她现在肯定是独自坐在我和她曾经度过欢乐时光的房间里，就在闪烁的壁炉火光下，那火光曾照耀我们度过的很多艰难而温情的时刻。在那里，她肯定是独坐着，在思忖着作为一个少女，她自己曾经极不符合身份地表达过她的情感，而且这种情感还被拒绝了。而与此同时，我却会独自在另一个地方，反思着自己（每当我很想发火的时候）在人性的脆弱以及女性的微妙情感方面的教训。总之，我想永远不会有人像这两个可怜的傻瓜那样因为极大的误会而害得自己闷闷不乐。","And for another thing she was now very much alone.Her father, when he was by, was rather a caressing parent; but he was very easy led away by his affairs and pleasures, neglected her without compunction or remark, spent his nights in taverns when he had the money, which was more often than I could at all account for; and even in the course of these few days, failed once to come to a meal, which Catriona and I were at last compelled to partake of without him.It was the evening meal, and I left immediately that I had eaten, observing I supposed she would prefer to be alone; to which she agreed and (strange as it may seem) I quite believed her.Indeed, I thought myself but an eyesore to the girl, and a reminder of a moment’s weakness that she now abhorred to think of.So she must sit alone in that room where she and I had been so merry, and in the blink of that chimney whose light had shone upon our many difficult and tender moments.There she must sit alone, and think of herself as of a maid who had most unmaidenly proffered her affections and had the same rejected.And in the meanwhile I would be alone some other place, and reading myself (whenever I was tempted to be angry) lessons upon human frailty and female delicacy.And altogether I suppose there were never two poor fools made themselves more unhappy in a greater misconception."
"至于詹姆斯，他并没有多注意我们，或者说除了他的钱袋、他的胃口和他自己的空谈外，他不关心任何事。他曾向我借过一小笔钱，还没过十二个小时，就在三十分钟前，他又第二次借钱，我拒绝了。借不借给他钱，他都同样心情很好。实际上，他表现出的一种宽宏大量的气度倒是真适合好好影响影响他女儿。他在谈话中常常表现出这一点，而且这个人仪表堂堂、处事有方，这一切很协调地融合在一起。所以一个没有跟他打过什么交道的人，要么就难以看透他，要么就会对他持有一股狂热的偏见，几乎都可能上他的当了。在我看来，见过一两次面后，他就像印刷品一样清晰了。我知道他自私透顶，可同时却一副完全清白的样子。我听着他高谈阔论（关于战争和“一个老兵”，还有“一个可怜的高地绅士”以及“我的国家和朋友的力量”之类），我都可以去鹦鹉学舌了。","As for James, he paid not so much heed to us, or to anything in nature but his pocket, and his belly, and his own prating talk.Before twelve hours were gone he had raised a small loan of me; before thirty, he had asked for a second and been refused.Money and refusal he took with the same kind of high good nature.Indeed, he had an outside air of magnanimity that was very well fitted to impose upon a daughter; and the light in which he was constantly presented in his talk, and the man’s fine presence and great ways went together pretty harmoniously.So that a man that had no business with him, and either very little penetration or a furious deal of prejudice, might almost have been taken in.To me, after my first two interviews, he was as plain as print; I saw him to be perfectly selfish, with a perfect innocency in the same; and I would hearken to his swaggering talk (of arms, and “an old soldier,” and “a poor Highland gentleman,” and “the strength of my country and my friends”) as I might to the babbling of a parrot."
"奇怪的是我感觉他自己也相信他胡吹的一些话，或者有时候相信。我认为他一直都太虚伪，所以他在撒谎时自己都不太有感觉了。只是有一点，他沮丧的时候确实很真诚。有几次他特别沉默寡言，很真挚，可能也很依赖人，他拉着卡特里奥娜的手就像个大孩子。他向我乞求说只要我对他有一点爱都不要抛弃他，其实我已经做到了，只不过更多是出于对他女儿的爱。他会催逼，实际上是恳求我们说话来让他开心，这对处于我们这种关系的人来说是一件很难办的事。他会再一次突发感慨，为自己的故土和朋友深深惋惜，或者突然就用盖尔语唱起歌来。","The odd thing was that I fancy he believed some part of it himself, or did at times; I think he was so false all through that he scarce knew when he was lying; and for one thing, his moments of dejection must have been wholly genuine.There were times when he would be the most silent, affectionate, clinging creature possible, holding Catriona’s hand like a big baby, and begging of me not to leave if I had any love to him; of which, indeed, I had none, but all the more to his daughter.He would press and indeed beseech us to entertain him with our talk, a thing very difficult in the state of our relations; and again break forth in pitiable regrets for his own land and friends, or into Gaelic singing."
"“这是我故乡的一首悲歌小调，”他会说，“看见一位士兵哭泣，你可能会觉得奇怪，可是实际上悲歌会让你有一个亲近的朋友。”他说，“但是这首歌的曲调已经融进我的血液，这些歌词是我发自心底的吟唱。当我想起那红色的山峰和山间鸣唱的野鸟，还有那壮观的、奔腾而下的溪流时，我就不会为自己在敌人面前哭泣而觉得羞耻了。”然后他又会唱起歌来，而且还会为我翻译部分歌词，只是语焉不详，而且明显表现出对英语的不屑。“这里是说，”他会说，“太阳已经落山，战事就要结束，可是勇敢的首领却失败了。而这里是说星星看着他们逃亡到陌生的国度或者阵亡在红色的山峰上。他们永远都不能再发出战斗的怒吼声，或者在山谷中的小溪里洗涤他们的双脚。但是只要你稍懂一点点盖尔语的话，你都会哭泣的，因为盖尔语里的这些话只可意会不可言传，所以用英语告诉你只是徒具其表罢了。”","“This is one of the melancholy airs of my native land,” he would say.“You may think it strange to see a soldier weep, and indeed it is to make a near friend of you,” says he.“But the notes of this singing are in my blood, and the words come out of my heart.And when I mind upon my red mountains and the wild birds calling there, and the brave streams of water running down, I would scarce think shame to weep before my enemies.”Then he would sing again, and translate to me pieces of the song, with a great deal of boggling and much expressed contempt against the English language.“It says here,” he would say, “that the sun is gone down, and the battle is at an end, and the brave chiefs are defeated.And it tells here how the stars see them fleeing into strange countries or lying dead on the red mountain; and they will never more shout the call of battle or wash their feet in the streams of the valley.But if you had only some of this language, you would weep also because the words of it are beyond all expression, and it is mere mockery to tell you it in English.”"
"那么，我想在这件事上有很多都是徒具其表的，不是这种形式就是那一种。然而我还是有种感觉，我觉得正是这种感觉让我恨透他了。当我确信他的一半痛苦是因为他前一天晚上在酒馆酗了酒时，我一看见卡特里奥娜这么关心这个老无赖，她看见他哭就会跟着哭，我就觉得心如刀割。有几次我都忍不住很想借给他一大笔钱，彻底解决他的事情，但是这样一来我可能就再也见不到卡特里奥娜了，对此我可还没有做好准备。此外，把我那珍贵的金钱用在这么一个简直不能算男子汉的人身上，那也有违我的良心。","Well, I thought there was a good deal of mockery in the business, one way and another; and yet, there was some feeling too, for which I hated him, I think, the worst of all.And it used to cut me to the quick to see Catriona so much concerned for the old rogue, and weeping herself to see him weep, when I was sure one half of his distress flowed from his last night’s drinking in some tavern.There were times when I was tempted to lend him a round sum, and see the last of him for good; but this would have been to see the last of Catriona as well, for which I was scarcely so prepared; and besides, it went against my conscience to squander my good money on one who was so little of a husband."
"第二十七章 两个人之间的一场较量","CHAPTER XXVII—A TWOSOME"
"我想大约是在第五天吧，至少我知道詹姆斯的情绪有点儿忧郁，这时我收到了三封信。第一封是艾伦写来的，信中提出要到莱登来看我。另外两封信都是从苏格兰寄来的，而且都是因为同一件事情，即我叔叔已经过世，我完全继承属于我的财产了。当然，兰基勒的那封信纯粹是就事论事，而格兰特小姐的信则恰如其人，与其说是睿智，不如说是诙谐更贴切些。她的信里满篇都在责怪我没有给她写信（尽管凭我这点智慧我又该怎么去写呢）。她还净写了些拿卡特里奥娜打趣的话，这让我当着卡特里奥娜的面读信时很伤自尊。","I believe it was about the fifth day, and I know at least that James was in one of his fits of gloom, when I received three letters.The first was from Alan, offering to visit me in Leyden; the other two were out of Scotland and prompted by the same affair, which was the death of my uncle and my own complete accession to my rights.Rankeillor’s was, of course, wholly in the business view; Miss Grant’s was like herself, a little more witty than wise, full of blame to me for not having written (though how was I to write with such intelligence?)and of rallying talk about Catriona, which it cut me to the quick to read in her very presence."
"当然，我是在自己的房间里发现这几封信的，当时我正要去吃晚饭，所以我打开信读的那一刹那就非常意外地公布了这个消息。我们三个人听闻此消息都很开心，但都没有预料到接下来会发生不好的结果。在同一天收到三封信本来就很巧了，而那些信送达我手上时恰好詹姆斯·莫尔又和我在同一个房间里。要是我早管住了自己的嘴，也许就可以防止由此引发的所有事情了。但事实却是在阿格里科拉进入苏格兰之前或者亚伯拉罕动身去旅行之前，这一切就已经命中注定了。","For it was of course in my own rooms that I found them, when I came to dinner, so that I was surprised out of my news in the very first moment of reading it.This made a welcome diversion for all three of us, nor could any have foreseen the ill consequences that ensued.It was accident that brought the three letters the same day, and that gave them into my hand in the same room with James More; and of all the events that flowed from that accident, and which I might have prevented if I had held my tongue, the truth is that they were preordained before Agricola came into Scotland or Abraham set out upon his travels."
"我首先打开的自然是艾伦的信，而且更自然的是我会对他的来访谈些看法。不过我注意到詹姆斯立刻一副关切的样子坐了起来。","The first that I opened was naturally Alan’s; and what more natural than that I should comment on his design to visit me? but I observed James to sit up with an air of immediate attention."
"“不是那个涉嫌阿平凶杀案的艾伦·布雷克吧？”他询问道。","“Is that not Alan Breck that was suspected of the Appin accident?” he inquired."
"我告诉他，“是的，正是同一个人。”于是他开始打听我们的这位熟人艾伦以及他在法国的生活习惯，对此我也不甚了解，可是他这样却耽误了我一些时间，害我不能看别的信件。随后他又进一步打听艾伦现在提出了什么样的来访计划。","I told him, “Ay,” it was the same; and he withheld me some time from my other letters, asking of our acquaintance, of Alan’s manner of life in France, of which I knew very little, and further of his visit as now proposed."
"“我们所有被褫夺的乡亲还是有点儿团结的，”他解释说，“此外，我了解这位绅士，虽然他的血统不正，实际上他根本没有权利使用斯图尔特这个姓氏，但是他在德拉莫西的那段日子却很受人们敬佩。他在那里的所作所为像个战士。如果说有些人，他们的名字就不必说了，也表现得很好的话，结局就不至于如此令人悲叹、不堪回首了。当时有两个人拼尽了全力，正是这一点把我们俩联系在一起了。”他说。","“All we forfeited folk hang a little together,” he explained, “and besides I know the gentleman: and though his descent is not the thing, and indeed he has no true right to use the name of Stewart, he was very much admired in the day of Drummossie.He did there like a soldier; if some that need not be named had done as well, the upshot need not have been so melancholy to remember.There were two that did their best that day, and it makes a bond between the pair of us,” says he."
"我差一点儿忍不住要向他开口询问了，而且心里非常希望艾伦当时在场，就可以更近一步去了解他的身世。虽然，有人告诉过我，那件事情着实非比寻常。","I could scarce refrain from shooting out my tongue at him, and could almost have wished that Alan had been there to have inquired a little further into that mention of his birth.Though, they tell me, the same was indeed not wholly regular."
"与此同时，我打开了格兰特小姐的信，而且忍不住发出了一声惊呼。","Meanwhile, I had opened Miss Grant’s, and could not withhold an exclamation."
"“卡特里奥娜！”我忘乎所以地喊道，自从她父亲来后这还是我第一次直呼其名，“我发达了，我现在真正是肖斯的领主了——我叔父终于死了。”","“Catriona,” I cried, forgetting, the first time since her father was arrived, to address her by a handle, “I am come into my kingdom fairly, I am the laird of Shaws indeed—my uncle is dead at last.”"
"她拍着双手从座位上跳了起来。接下来我们两个人马上都意识到我们实在没有理由为此欢欣雀跃，于是我们面对面站着，悲哀地互相凝视着对方。","She clapped her hands together leaping from her seat.The next moment it must have come over both of us at once what little cause of joy was left to either, and we stood opposite, staring on each other sadly."
"但是詹姆斯却立即表现出一副伪君子模样。 “我的女儿，”他说，“难道这就是我那堂姐教你的行为礼节吗？戴维先生刚失去了一位亲友，我们首先应该对他痛失亲人表示慰问才是。”","But James showed himself a ready hypocrite.“My daughter,” says he, “is this how my cousin learned you to behave?Mr. David has lost a new friend, and we should first condole with him on his bereavement.”"
"“说实话，先生，”我有点儿生气地转向他说道，“我做不出这样的表情。他的死是我得到的最大的喜讯。”","“Troth, sir,” said I, turning to him in a kind of anger, “I can make no such great faces.His death is as blithe news as ever I got.”"
"“这正是一位优秀战士的哲学，”詹姆斯说，“这就是芸芸众生之路，我们肯定都会死的，都会死的。如果你那么不喜欢这位绅士的话，那么，很好！不过至少我们要祝贺你继承了财产。”","“It’s a good soldier’s philosophy,” says James.“’Tis the way of flesh, we must all go, all go.And if the gentleman was so far from your favour, why, very well!But we may at least congratulate you on your accession to your estates.”"
"“我也不能那么说。”我还是怒气冲冲地回答说，“这是一份丰厚的财产，不过对于一个已经富足却孤单无伴的男人而言又有什么意义呢？我生活节俭，已经有一笔可观的收入了。但是只有这个家伙死了，我才感到称心，虽然我为此感到羞愧却又不得不承认这一点！我看不出一个人怎么会通过这种变故来变富。”","“Nor can I say that either,” I replied, with the same heat.“It is a good estate; what matters that to a lone man that has enough already?I had a good revenue before in my frugality; and but for the man’s death—which gratifies me, shame to me that must confess it!—I see not how anyone is to be bettered by this change.”"
"“好了，好了，”他说，“你的感情发泄得过于强烈了，或许你从来没有觉得自己会如此孤单。这里有三封信，也就意味着有三个人是希望你好的，何况我还可以说出两个人来，他们现在就在这间房里。我认识你的时间虽然不是太长，但是卡特里奥娜，每当我们俩单独在一起时，总是对你赞不绝口。” ","“Come, come,” said he, “you are more affected than you let on, or you would never make yourself out so lonely.Here are three letters; that means three that wish you well; and I could name two more, here in this very chamber.I have known you not so very long, but Catriona, when we are alone, is never done with the singing of your praises.”"
"她听到这话有点儿生气，抬头看着他，于是他立刻转移话题谈论另外一件事情，即我的财产多少，（晚餐时的大部分时间）他继续兴致勃勃勃地在详细谈论着该话题。不过他没有打算掩饰他的意图，他对这件事情过于关注，而我也知道会发生什么事情。晚饭还没吃完，他就直白地表露他的意图了。他提醒卡特里奥娜说还有一件事情，然后就吩咐她去办理。“我认为你办这件事情不会超过一个小时，”他补充道，“而戴维朋友会好心陪伴我直到你回来的。她没说一句话便急忙照他的吩咐去办事了。我不知道她是否明白了，我认为是没有。但我非常满意，坐在那里竭力在想着接下来会发生什么。","She looked up at him, a little wild at that; and he slid off at once into another matter, the extent of my estate, which (during the most of the dinner time) he continued to dwell upon with interest.But it was to no purpose he dissembled; he had touched the matter with too gross a hand: and I knew what to expect.Dinner was scarce ate when he plainly discovered his designs.He reminded Catriona of an errand, and bid her attend to it.“I do not see you should be one beyond the hour,” he added, “and friend David will be good enough to bear me company till you return.”She made haste to obey him without words.I do not know if she understood, I believe not; but I was completely satisfied, and sat strengthening my mind for what should follow."
"她离开后就把门关了，这时那个家伙向后靠在椅背上，带着一种轻松温和的表情对我发话了。只有一样东西出卖了他，那就是他的脸。他的脸上突然布满了星星点点晶亮的汗珠。","The door had scarce closed behind her departure, when the man leaned back in his chair and addressed me with a good affectation of easiness.Only the one thing betrayed him, and that was his face; which suddenly shone all over with fine points of sweat."
"“我很高兴能和你单独谈谈，”他说，“因为在我们第一次见面时，有些话你就误解了，我一直都想跟你解释清楚的。我女儿的态度是毋庸置疑的。你的也一样，那么我会用我的剑来对付所有的反对者，以促成这件好事。但是我亲爱的戴维，这个世界对人是很苛刻的——这一点有谁会比我更清楚呢？还是从先父在世起（愿上帝保佑他！），我就一直生活在一个诽谤中伤恣意泛滥的世界里了。那是我们不得不面对的，我和你不能不考虑这一点，我们必须得考虑这一点。”他摇头晃脑，像是布道坛上的一位牧师。","“I am rather glad to have a word alone with you,” says he, “because in our first interview there were some expressions you misapprehended and I have long meant to set you right upon.My daughter stands beyond doubt.So do you, and I would make that good with my sword against all gainsayers.But, my dear David, this world is a censorious place—as who should know it better than myself, who have lived ever since the days of my late departed father, God sain him! in a perfect spate of calumnies?We have to face to that; you and me have to consider of that; we have to consider of that.”And he wagged his head like a minister in a pulpit."
"“德拉蒙德先生，你想要什么样的结果？”我说，“如果你能直奔主题，我将不胜感激。”","“To what effect, Mr. Drummond?” said I.“I would be obliged to you if you would approach your point.”"
"“哎呀，哎呀，”他笑着说，“的确是有个性！这也是我最欣赏的。不过，我尊敬的朋友，问题是有时候会有一些小麻烦的。”他斟满了一杯葡萄酒。“虽然你我相识不久，却一见如故，这个问题不会困扰我们很久。问题的关键，不需要我跟你说，就是我女儿。首先，我从没有想过要责怪你。在那种不幸的环境下，你还能做什么呢？确实，我也想不出。”","“Ay, ay,” said he, laughing, “like your character, indeed! and what I most admire in it.But the point, my worthy fellow, is sometimes in a kittle bit.”He filled a glass of wine.“Though between you and me, that are such fast friends, it need not bother us long.The point, I need scarcely tell you, is my daughter.And the first thing is that I have no thought in my mind of blaming you.In the unfortunate circumstances, what could you do else?’Deed, and I cannot tell.”"
"“我为此谢谢你。”我说，带有很强的戒备心理。","“I thank you for that,” said I, pretty close upon my guard."
"“此外我还研究过你的性格。”他继续说道，“你才华出众，但似乎能力平平，这不要紧。权衡之下，我很高兴地向你宣布：我已经决定从两种可选方法中选定第二种了。”","“I have besides studied your character,” he went on; “your talents are fair; you seem to have a moderate competence, which does no harm; and one thing with another, I am very happy to have to announce to you that I have decided on the latter of the two ways open.”"
"“恐怕是我愚钝，”我说，“是哪两种方法？”","“I am afraid I am dull,” said I.“What ways are these?”"
"他对着我皱紧了眉头，样子让人生畏，然后他放下翘着的二郎腿。“哎呀，先生，”他说，“我觉得我没必要对处于你这样地位的绅士来详细描述吧。要么就是我割断你的喉咙，要么就是你娶我的女儿。”","He bent his brows upon me formidably and uncrossed his legs.“Why, sir,” says he, “I think I need scarce describe them to a gentleman of your condition; either that I should cut your throat or that you should marry my daughter.”"
"“你终于愿意把话挑明了。”我说。","“You are pleased to be quite plain at last,” said I."
"“我认为从一开始我就说得很明白！”他粗鲁地叫喊道，“鲍尔弗先生，我是一个小心谨慎的家长。不过我感谢上帝，我是个很耐心而且处事谨慎的人。先生，很多当父亲的会马上拽着你，要么就去教堂结婚，要么就去野外决斗了。我尊重你的人品——”","“And I believe I have been plain from the beginning!” cries he robustiously.“I am a careful parent, Mr. Balfour; but I thank God, a patient and deleeborate man.There is many a father, sir, that would have hirsled you at once either to the altar or the field.My esteem for your character—”"
"“德拉蒙德先生，”我打断他的话，“如果你真的对我还有一丝尊重的话，我请你说话语气节制一点儿。你大可不必对一个与你同处一室的绅士口出恶言，何况他还对你关照有加。”","“Mr. Drummond,” I interrupted, “if you have any esteem for me at all, I will beg of you to moderate your voice.It is quite needless to rowt at a gentleman in the same chamber with yourself and lending you his best attention.”"
"“是啊，真的是这样。”他说，立即改了腔调，“你一定要谅解一位父亲的激动情绪。”","“Why, very true,” says he, with an immediate change.“And you must excuse the agitations of a parent.”"
"“那么我理解你，”我继续说道，“因为我根本不在意你的另一种选择，很遗憾那也许只是你提出的选择而已——我的理解是假如我愿意提出牵你女儿的手，你会鼓励我这么做？”","“I understand you then,” I continued—“for I will take no note of your other alternative, which perhaps it was a pity you let fall—I understand you rather to offer me encouragement in case I should desire to apply for your daughter’s hand?”"
"“我无法更好地表达我的想法，”他说，“不过我想我们会一起处理好的。”","“It is not possible to express my meaning better,” said he, “and I see we shall do well together.”"
"“那就不得而知了。”我说，“不过我也没必要有所隐瞒，我对你说的那位女士怀有最温柔的情感，而且即使在梦里，我都无法想象会有比得到她更好的运气了。”","“That remains to be yet seen,” said I.“But so much I need make no secret of, that I bear the lady you refer to the most tender affection, and I could not fancy, even in a dream, a better fortune than to get her.”"
"“我对此确信无疑，我对你也很有把握，戴维。”他叫道，并向我伸出手。","“I was sure of it, I felt certain of you, David,” he cried, and reached out his hand to me."
"我拨开他的手。“你太性急了，德拉蒙德先生。”我说，“有些条件还需要创造，而且前进的道路上还有困难，我并不完全清楚我们怎样才能克服这个困难。我已经告诉你了，在我这方面，是毫不反对这桩婚姻的，但是我有充足的理由认为那位年轻女士颇为反对。”","I put it by.“You go too fast, Mr. Drummond,” said I.“There are conditions to be made; and there is a difficulty in the path, which I see not entirely how we shall come over.I have told you that, upon my side, there is no objection to the marriage, but I have good reason to believe there will be much on the young lady’s.”"
"“这完全无关紧要，”他说，“我保证让她接受。”","“This is all beside the mark,” says he.“I will engage for her acceptance.”"
"“我想你是忘记了，德拉蒙德先生，”我说，“我们俩谈话这段时间，我已经发现你三番两次说一些让人生厌的话了。我决不会请任何人来插手这位年轻女士的事情。我在这里只谈论也只考虑我们两个人的事，而且我希望你明白，我不会让人硬塞给自己一个妻子，更不会让人硬塞一个丈夫给那位年轻的女士。”","“I think you forget, Mr. Drummond,” said I, “that, even in dealing with myself, you have been betrayed into two-three unpalatable expressions.I will have none such employed to the young lady.I am here to speak and think for the two of us; and I give you to understand that I would no more let a wife be forced upon myself, than what I would let a husband be forced on the young lady.”"
"他坐着，对我怒目而视，像是满腹狐疑而且满腔怒火的样子。","He sat and glowered at me like one in doubt and a good deal of temper."
"“所以解决的方法只能是那样，”我下结论说，“只要德拉蒙德小姐心甘情愿，我就会娶她，而且会非常开心。但是只要她有丝毫的不情愿，对此我有理由担心——我就绝不会娶她。”","“So that is to be the way of it,” I concluded.“I will marry Miss Drummond, and that blithely, if she is entirely willing.But if there be the least unwillingness, as I have reason to fear—marry her will I never.”"
"“好，好，”他说，“这是一件小事。她一回来，我就探探她的口风，希望能让你安心——”","“Well well,” said he, “this is a small affair.As soon as she returns I will sound her a bit, and hope to reassure you—”"
"但是我再次打断了他的话。“德拉蒙德先生，你绝不能插手，否则这件事就作罢，那你就到别处去给你女儿物色一个丈夫吧。”我说，“我才是唯一的当事人和唯一的裁判。我要让自己完全满意，其他任何人都休想干涉——尤其是你。”","But I cut in again.“Not a finger of you, Mr. Drummond, or I cry off, and you can seek a husband to your daughter somewhere else,” said I.“It is I that am to be the only dealer and the only judge.I shall satisfy myself exactly; and none else shall anyways meddle—you the least of all.”"
"“听我说，先生！”他叫嚷道，“你是什么人，凭什么要去当裁判？”","“Upon my word, sir!” he exclaimed, “and who are you to be the judge?”"
"“新郎吧，我认为。”我说。","“The bridegroom, I believe,” said I."
"“你这是狡辩，”他叫道，“你枉顾事实。那个女孩，我的女儿，根本就没有选择的余地。她的名誉已经毁了。”","“This is to quibble,” he cried.“You turn your back upon the fact.The girl, my daughter, has no choice left to exercise.Her character is gone.”"
"“那么我请你原谅，”我说，“但是这件事情虽说是在她、你和我之间，然而事情并非如此。","“And I ask your pardon,” said I, “but while this matter lies between her and you and me, that is not so.”"
"“我有什么保障！”他叫道，“难道我要让我女儿的名声全凭运气吗？”","“What security have I!” he cried.“Am I to let my daughter’s reputation depend upon a chance?”"
"“你早就应该想到这一点的，”我说，“在你任意妄为失去她之前就该想到，而不是在那之后，那时就太晚了。我绝不会为你的疏忽承担责任，也没有哪个活人能吓唬住我。我意已决，不论发生什么，我都不会有丝毫偏离。你和我就一起坐在这里直到她回来。她回来时你一个字都不要提，也不要透露一点儿神情，我和她再继续我们的谈话。如果她能让我确信她愿意走这一步，那么我就会去做；如果她不能，我就不会做。”","“You should have thought of all this long ago,” said I, “before you were so misguided as to lose her; and not afterwards when it is quite too late.I refuse to regard myself as any way accountable for your neglect, and I will be browbeat by no man living.My mind is quite made up, and come what may, I will not depart from it a hair’s breadth.You and me are to sit here in company till her return: upon which, without either word or look from you, she and I are to go forth again to hold our talk.If she can satisfy me that she is willing to this step, I will then make it; and if she cannot, I will not.”"
"他像被刺到了一样，从椅子上跳了起来。“我能看透你的伎俩，”他叫道，“你想劝她去拒绝！”","He leaped out of his chair like a man stung.“I can spy your manoeuvre,” he cried; “you would work upon her to refuse!”"
"“也许是，也许不是，”我说，“无论如何，就得那样去解决。”","“Maybe ay, and maybe no,” said I.“That is the way it is to be, whatever.”"
"“那要是我拒绝呢？”他叫道。","“And if I refuse?” cries he."
"“那么，德拉蒙德先生，那就只好来一场你死我活的决斗了。”我说。","“Then, Mr. Drummond, it will have to come to the throat-cutting,” said I."
"这个人身材高大，手臂长得几乎可以与其父媲美，而且据说他剑术娴熟。我说这话时其实很害怕，更不必说他还是卡特里奥娜的父亲了。不过我也许没有必要惊慌。从我住处的简陋——他似乎没有注意到他女儿的衣服，那些衣服他其实都没见过——从我不愿意给他借钱这个事实，他已经坚信我很贫穷了。突然有消息说及我的财产，这使他确信自己的判断错误了，于是他就孤注一掷做出了这次冒险的举动，而且他现在执意这么做，所以我相信他宁愿忍受一切都不会选择去决斗的。","What with the size of the man, his great length of arm in which he came near rivalling his father, and his reputed skill at weapons, I did not use this word without trepidation, to say nothing at all of the circumstance that he was Catriona’s father.But I might have spared myself alarms.From the poorness of my lodging—he does not seem to have remarked his daughter’s dresses, which were indeed all equally new to him—and from the fact that I had shown myself averse to lend, he had embraced a strong idea of my poverty.The sudden news of my estate convinced him of his error, and he had made but the one bound of it on this fresh venture, to which he was now so wedded, that I believe he would have suffered anything rather than fall to the alternative of fighting."
"他继续跟我争论了好一会儿，直到我偶然说出一句话才让他安静下来。","A little while longer he continued to dispute with me, until I hit upon a word that silenced him."
"“如果我发现你如此反对我和你女儿单独见面，”我说，“我只能假设你有充足的理由认为我的想法是对的，她真的不愿意嫁给我。”","“If I find you so averse to let me see the lady by herself,” said I, “I must suppose you have very good grounds to think me in the right about her unwillingness.”"
"他喋喋不休地在辩解着。","He gabbled some kind of an excuse."
"“但是这一切只会使我们双方精疲力竭，”我补充说，“所以我认为我们最好是很明智地保持沉默。”","“But all this is very exhausting to both of our tempers,” I added, “and I think we would do better to preserve a judicious silence.”"
"我们就这样保持着沉默，一直到那位姑娘回来，而且我想当时如果有人看见我们的话，一定觉得我们的样子很好笑。","The which we did until the girl returned, and I must suppose would have cut a very ridiculous figure had there been any there to view us."
"第二十八章 剩下我孤独在此","CHAPTER XXVIII—IN WHICH I AM LEFT ALONE"
"我给卡特里奥娜开了门，并在门口拦住了她。","I opened the door to Catriona and stopped her on the threshold."
"“你父亲希望我们去散散步。”我说。","“Your father wishes us to take our walk,” said I."
"她朝詹姆斯·莫尔望去，他点了点头。见此，她就像一个受过训练的士兵一样，转身就和我一起走了。","She looked to James More, who nodded, and at that, like a trained soldier, she turned to go with me."
"我们走的是一条曾经走过的老路。那条路我们过去经常一起走，而过去的那种幸福是我无法言说的。我比她落后了半步，这样我就可以观察她而不被其察觉。她那双小巧的鞋子敲击地面的声音听起来特别动听而又伤感。我觉得那一刻很奇特，我居然同时如此靠近两种不同的结果，走在两种命运的中间。我不知道我是最后一次听到这些脚步声呢，还是这些声音会一直陪我走进走出，直到死亡将我们分开。","We took one of our old ways, where we had gone often together, and been more happy than I can tell of in the past.I came a half a step behind, so that I could watch her unobserved.The knocking of her little shoes upon the way sounded extraordinary pretty and sad; and I thought it a strange moment that I should be so near both ends of it at once, and walk in the midst between two destinies, and could not tell whether I was hearing these steps for the last time, or whether the sound of them was to go in and out with me till death should part us."
"她甚至回避看我，只是一味地在前面走着，好像她已经猜到了将会发生的事情。我明白我必须趁着勇气尚未耗尽赶紧开口说话，可是我却不知道该从何说起。这位姑娘实际上等于被迫投入了我的怀抱，而且已经在恳求我的克制，在这种困境中，任何过分的压力似乎都不合情理，然而要完全避免这么做就得显出一副冷酷无情的样子。在这种极端的矛盾中，我无助地站着，可能都已经在咬手指了。因此，当我终于开口说话时，可以说我是随口说出的。","She avoided even to look at me, only walked before her, like one who had a guess of what was coming.I saw I must speak soon before my courage was run out, but where to begin I knew not.In this painful situation, when the girl was as good as forced into my arms and had already besought my forbearance, any excess of pressure must have seemed indecent; yet to avoid it wholly would have a very cold-like appearance.Between these extremes I stood helpless, and could have bit my fingers; so that, when at last I managed to speak at all, it may be said I spoke at random."
"“卡特里奥娜，”我说，“我现在处于很难堪的境地，或者说，我们两个人都一样。如果你答应让我先把话说完，而且在我说完之前不打断我，那我将不胜感激。”","“Catriona,” said I, “I am in a very painful situation; or rather, so we are both; and I would be a good deal obliged to you if you would promise to let me speak through first of all, and not to interrupt me till I have done.”"
"她爽快地答应了。","She promised me that simply."
"“那么，”我说，“我要说的话很难开口，而且我很清楚我没有权利这么说。自从上周五我们俩之间说过那些话之后，我就没有权利再说什么了。我们之间一直如此纠缠不清（当然全是我的错），我非常清楚我唯有尽量保持沉默，我也尽力这么做了，而且我根本没有想过要再次打扰你。但是，亲爱的，现在已经变得很有必要这么做了，此外也别无他法。你看，我的财产已经落到我的名下，这样就使我成为了更好的配偶。而且这件——这件事情也就显得不像以前那样荒唐可笑了。 此外，我想既然我们之间的事情已经如此纠缠不清（正如我刚才说的），那么就顺其自然，岂不更好？在我看来，这件事情中的这个部分被过分地夸大了，如果我是你，我就不会对此有两种不同的想法。只不过我提到这件事情也对，因为毫无疑问它对詹姆斯·莫尔有一些影响。然后我又想我们以前在这个城市一起住的时候一直都是非常开心的。我认为我们一起相处得很好。亲爱的，如果你回头看看……”","“Well,” said I, “this that I have got to say is very difficult, and I know very well I have no right to be saying it.After what passed between the two of us last Friday, I have no manner of right.We have got so ravelled up (and all by my fault) that I know very well the least I could do is just to hold my tongue, which was what I intended fully, and there was nothing further from my thoughts than to have troubled you again.But, my dear, it has become merely necessary, and no way by it.You see, this estate of mine has fallen in, which makes of me rather a better match; and the—the business would not have quite the same ridiculous-like appearance that it would before.Besides which, it’s supposed that our affairs have got so much ravelled up (as I was saying) that it would be better to let them be the way they are.In my view, this part of the thing is vastly exagerate, and if I were you I would not wear two thoughts on it.Only it’s right I should mention the same, because there’s no doubt it has some influence on James More.Then I think we were none so unhappy when we dwelt together in this town before.I think we did pretty well together.If you would look back, my dear—”"
"“我既不会向后看也不会向前看。”她打断了我的话，“只要告诉我一件事：这是我父亲要做的吧？”","“I will look neither back nor forward,” she interrupted.“Tell me the one thing: this is my father’s doing?”"
"“他同意我这么做的，”我说，“他同意我向你求婚。”我再次说道，更像是在恳求她的感情。但是她不为我所动，在我说话中间就打断了我。","“He approves of it,” said I.“He approved I that I should ask your hand in marriage,” and was going on again with somewhat more of an appeal upon her feelings; but she marked me not, and struck into the midst."
"“是他叫你做的！”她大喊道，“你否认也没意义，你自己都说了你根本就没有想过。是他叫你做的。”","“He told you to!” she cried.“It is no sense denying it, you said yourself that there was nothing farther from your thoughts.He told you to.”"
"“他先说起这件事的，如果你想那么说的话。”我开始说。","“He spoke of it the first, if that is what you mean,” I began."
"她走得更快了，直视着前方。但是听到这句话，她脑袋里有点儿嗡嗡作响，所以我想她可能会跑了。","She was walking ever the faster, and looking fain in front of her; but at this she made a little noise in her head, and I thought she would have run."
"“如果没有这件事，”我继续说，“在上周五你说过那番话之后，我就绝不会这么不识趣来求婚了。但是当他几乎是在要求我的时候，那我该怎么办？”","“Without which,” I went on, “after what you said last Friday, I would never have been so troublesome as make the offer.But when he as good as asked me, what was I to do?”"
"她停住脚步转身对着我。","She stopped and turned round upon me."
"“那么，无论如何都要回绝。”她叫道，“这件事情到此为止。”","“Well, it is refused at all events,” she cried, “and there will be an end of that.”"
"然后她又开始朝前走去。","And she began again to walk forward."
"“我想我是不可能期待有更好的结果了，”我说，“但是我觉得在这最后结束之时你可以尽量对我和善一点儿吧。我不理解你为什么要对我这么苛刻。我一直非常爱你，卡特里奥娜——我最后一次这么叫你，对你也不会有什么伤害了。我已经尽我所能作出最大的努力了，我仍然在尽力，只是对自己无法做得更好而感到烦恼。你居然以对我苛刻无情为乐，这让我觉得很奇怪。”","“I suppose I could expect no better,” said I, “but I think you might try to be a little kind to me for the last end of it.I see not why you should be harsh.I have loved you very well, Catriona—no harm that I should call you so for the last time.I have done the best that I could manage, I am trying the same still, and only vexed that I can do no better.It is a strange thing to me that you can take any pleasure to be hard to me.”"
"“我不是冲着你来的，”她说，“我是冲着那个人，冲着我的父亲来的。”","“I am not thinking of you,” she said, “I am thinking of that man, my father.”"
"“好吧，就那么办吧，也行！”我说，“那么办，我对你也会有用，我必须对你有用才行。亲爱的，我们非常有必要和你父亲商量商量，因为我们这下子谈崩了，生气的人就会是詹姆斯·莫尔。”","“Well, and that way, too!” said I.“I can be of use to you that way, too; I will have to be.It is very needful, my dear, that we should consult about your father; for the way this talk has gone, an angry man will be James More.”"
"她再次停了下来。“那是因为我丢脸了？”她问道。","She stopped again.“It is because I am disgraced?” she asked."
"“那是他的想法，”我回答道，“但是我已经跟你说过不要在意。”","“That is what he is thinking,” I replied, “but I have told you already to make nought of it.”"
"“这对我来说全都一样，”她叫道，“我宁愿丢脸！”","“It will be all one to me,” she cried.“I prefer to be disgraced!”"
"我不知道该怎么回答才好，所以就一声不吭地站着。","I did not know very well what to answer, and stood silent."
"她刚才那么叫喊之后，心里似乎有什么东西在沸腾，跟着立刻就爆发了：“所有这一切都是什么意思？为什么要把这一切羞辱都加在我的头上？戴维·鲍尔弗，你怎么敢这样？”","There seemed to be something working in her bosom after that last cry; presently she broke out, “And what is the meaning of all this?Why is all this shame loundered on my head?How could you dare it, David Balfour?”"
"“我亲爱的，”我说，“我还能怎么做呢？”","“My dear,” said I, “what else was I to do?”"
"“我不是你的亲爱的，”她说，“我不准你用这几个词称呼我。”","“I am not your dear,” she said, “and I defy you to be calling me these words.”"
"“我没在想我用的词，”我说，“我的心在为你泣血，德拉蒙德小姐。不论我说什么，可以肯定我很同情你的艰难处境。但是有一点儿我希望你考虑一下，就是我们是不是应该呆久一点儿来平静地讨论这件事情，因为我们两个人回去的时候，肯定会有一场争吵的。相信我，这件事情需要我们俩平心静气地来解决。”","“I am not thinking of my words,” said I.“My heart bleeds for you, Miss Drummond.Whatever I may say, be sure you have my pity in your difficult position.But there is just the one thing that I wish you would bear in view, if it was only long enough to discuss it quietly; for there is going to be a collieshangie when we two get home.Take my word for it, it will need the two of us to make this matter end in peace.”"
"“好。”她说。她的双颊飞起一片红晕。“他说要跟你决斗吗？”她说。","“Ay,” said she.There sprang a patch of red in either of her cheeks.“Was he for fighting you?” said she."
"“是的，他是那么说的。”我说。","“Well, he was that,” said I."
"她发出一种可怕的大笑声。“无论如何，这事是完了！”她叫道。然后她转向我。“我和我父亲还真是一对好搭档，”她说，“不过我感谢仁慈的上帝居然还有人比我们更不如。 我感谢仁慈的上帝让我看清你这副模样。永远不会再有女孩子会看得起你了。”","She gave a dreadful kind of laugh.“At all events, it is complete!” she cried.And then turning on me.“My father and I are a fine pair,” said she, “but I am thanking the good God there will be somebody worse than what we are.I am thanking the good God that he has let me see you so.There will never be the girl made that will not scorn you.”"
"我一直都保持着极度的耐心，但是这也太过分了。","I had borne a good deal pretty patiently, but this was over the mark."
"“你没有权利那样对我说话，”我说，“我所做的一切都只是为你好，或者说试图为你好。而这就是我得到的回报！哦，这太过分了。”","“You have no right to speak to me like that,” said I.“What have I done but to be good to you, or try to be?And here is my repayment!O, it is too much.”"
"她直盯着我，露出一种可恨的微笑。“懦夫！”她说。","She kept looking at me with a hateful smile.“Coward!” said she."
"“你嗓子里蹦出的词和你父亲的一样！”我叫道，“今天为了你的权益，我已经向他挑战了。我会再次向他挑战，这个卑鄙小人，我才不管我们当中哪一个会倒下呢！来吧，”我说，“我们一起回住处去。让我们了结这件事情，让我和你们这帮高地佬彻底了结吧！我死的时候你会看到你想看的一切！”","“The word in your throat and in your father’s!” I cried.“I have dared him this day already in your interest.I will dare him again, the nasty pole-cat; little I care which of us should fall!Come,” said I, “back to the house with us; let us be done with it, let me be done with the whole Hieland crew of you!You will see what you think when I am dead.”"
"她对着我摇摇头，带着同样的微笑，我简直想揍她了。","She shook her head at me with that same smile I could have struck her for."
"“哦，让你的笑见鬼去吧！”我叫道，“今天我已经见过你那位了不起的父亲的微笑了，不过他笑错了对象而已。当然，我倒不是说他害怕。”我急忙补充道，“但是他宁可选择另一个办法来解决。”","“O, smile away!” I cried.“I have seen your bonny father smile on the wrong side this day.Not that I mean he was afraid, of course,” I added hastily, “but he preferred the other way of it.”"
"“是怎么回事？”她问。","“What is this?” she asked."
"“当时我提出要和他拔剑决斗。”我说。","“When I offered to draw with him,” said I."
"“你曾对詹姆斯·莫尔提出拔剑决斗!”她叫道。","“You offered to draw upon James More!” she cried."
"“我是这么做的，”我说，“却发现他退缩了，否则我们怎么会在这里？”","“And I did so,” said I, “and found him backward enough, or how would we be here?”"
"“这么做是有含义的吧，”她说，“你这到底是什么意思？”","“There is a meaning upon this,” said she.“What is it you are meaning?”"
"“他要逼你接受我，”我回答说，“而我不同意那么做。我说你应该是自由的，所以我必须和你单独谈谈，我真没有想到居然会是这么一场谈话！他说：‘要是我拒绝呢？’‘那么，德拉蒙德先生，那就只好来一场你死我活的决斗了。’我说，‘因为我不会让人硬塞给自己一个妻子，更不会让人硬塞一个丈夫给那位年轻的女士。’这就是我说过的话，这是一位朋友说过的话。为此我付出了多大的代价呀！现在你按自己的意愿明确地拒绝了我，那么不论是在高地还是其外，都不会有什么父亲可以强加这桩婚姻了。我会保证你的意愿受到尊重，我会一如既往地把这看成是自己的事情。但是我觉得你也许应该有礼貌，哪怕是装出有点儿感激的样子都好。实际上，我以为你更了解我！我对你表现得虽然不是很好，但那只是软弱。可是你居然认为我是懦夫，而且是那么一种懦夫——哦，我的姑娘，这可是致命的一击啊！”","“He was to make you take me,” I replied, “and I would not have it.I said you should be free, and I must speak with you alone; little I supposed it would be such a speaking!‘And what if I refuse?’ said he.—‘Then it must come to the throat-cutting,’ says I, ‘for I will no more have a husband forced on that young lady, than what I would have a wife forced upon myself.’  These were my words, they were a friend’s words; bonnily have I paid for them!Now you have refused me of your own clear free will, and there lives no father in the Highlands, or out of them, that can force on this marriage.I will see that your wishes are respected; I will make the same my business, as I have all through.But I think you might have that decency as to affect some gratitude.‘Deed, and I thought you knew me better!I have not behaved quite well to you, but that was weakness.And to think me a coward, and such a coward as that—O, my lass, there was a stab for the last of it!”"
"“戴维，那我该怎么想？”她叫道，“哦，这件事太可怕了！我和我的家人，”她说这话时带着一种可怜的哭腔，“我和我的家人都不配和你说话。哦，我应该在大街上向你下跪，我应该吻你的手请求宽恕！”","“Davie, how would I guess?” she cried.“O, this is a dreadful business!Me and mine,”—she gave a kind of a wretched cry at the word—“me and mine are not fit to speak to you.O, I could be kneeling down to you in the street, I could be kissing your hands for forgiveness!”"
"“我会保留从你那里得到的吻，”我叫道，“我会保留我想要的吻和值得保留的吻，但我绝不要忏悔的吻。”","“I will keep the kisses I have got from you already,” cried I.“I will keep the ones I wanted and that were something worth; I will not be kissed in penitence.”"
"“那对这个可怜的女孩你还能怎么想？”她说。","“What can you be thinking of this miserable girl?” says she."
"“这一阵子我一直想告诉你的！”我说，“你最好别理我。如果你不理我，你就不会再让我不快乐，你就可以去照顾你的父亲詹姆斯·莫尔，和他在一起，你就像是有一个奇怪的线轴一样可以围着他转了。”","“What I am trying to tell you all this while!” said I, “that you had best leave me alone, whom you can make no more unhappy if you tried, and turn your attention to James More, your father, with whom you are like to have a queer pirn to wind.”"
"“哦，我一定会独自和这样一个人一起去闯荡世界的！”她叫道，而且似乎费了很大的劲想克制住自己。“不过不会再为此麻烦你了，”她说，“他不了解我的内心是什么本性。他将为今天付出昂贵的代价，非常、非常昂贵的代价，他一定会付的。”","“O, that I must be going out into the world alone with such a man!” she cried, and seemed to catch herself in with a great effort.“But trouble yourself no more for that,” said she.“He does not know what kind of nature is in my heart.He will pay me dear for this day of it; dear, dear, will he pay.”"
"她转过身，开始走回家，我就陪着她。见此，她停了下来。","She turned, and began to go home and I to accompany her.At which she stopped."
"“我要一个人回去，”她说，“我必须单独见他。”","“I will be going alone,” she said.“It is alone I must be seeing him.”"
"我恼怒万分地在街上转了一会儿，内心暗忖自己是基督教国度被利用得最惨的青年了。愤怒令我窒息，对我来说深呼吸固然不错，可是莱登似乎已经没有足够的空气供我呼吸，而我觉得自己就像一个沉在海底的人，已经要爆炸了。我在街角停下来嘲笑了自己一会儿，笑得很大声，结果有个过路人都在看我了，这才让我清醒过来。","Some little time I raged about the streets, and told myself I was the worst used lad in Christendom.Anger choked me; it was all very well for me to breathe deep; it seemed there was not air enough about Leyden to supply me, and I thought I would have burst like a man at the bottom of the sea.I stopped and laughed at myself at a street corner a minute together, laughing out loud, so that a passenger looked at me, which brought me to myself."
"“好吧，”我想，“我当傻瓜、笨蛋和软蛋已经当得够久了。是结束的时候了。这是个沉重的教训，千万别和那种该死的性别扯上瓜葛，那自始至终都会是对男人的毁灭。上帝知道在遇见她之前我有多么快乐，上帝知道永不再见她之后我又可以快乐无比了。”","“Well,” I thought, “I have been a gull and a ninny and a soft Tommy long enough.Time it was done.Here is a good lesson to have nothing to do with that accursed sex, that was the ruin of the man in the beginning and will be so to the end.God knows I was happy enough before ever I saw her; God knows I can be happy enough again when I have seen the last of her.”"
"似乎对我来说，最重要的事情就是看着他们离开。我的头脑中强烈地缠绕着这个念头，马上有点儿恶毒地想到：当戴维·鲍尔弗不再充当他们的奶牛时，他们的生活将会多么穷困啊。想到此，我自己都大吃了一惊，我心里的想法完全倒过来了。我还在生气，也还在恨她。然而我觉得这是我自找的，但她不该遭这个罪。","That seemed to me the chief affair: to see them go.I dwelled upon the idea fiercely; and presently slipped on, in a kind of malevolence, to consider how very poorly they were likely to fare when Davie Balfour was no longer by to be their milk-cow; at which, to my very own great surprise, the disposition of my mind turned bottom up.I was still angry; I still hated her; and yet I thought I owed it to myself that she should suffer nothing."
"这种想法立刻驱使我回了家，结果发现行李已经搬到外面，而且已经捆好就放在门边，种种迹象表明他们父女俩才争吵过。卡特里奥娜就像个木偶，詹姆斯·莫尔则喘着粗气，他的脸上气得红一块白一块的，而他的鼻子也扭向了一边。我一进去，那女孩就看向他，带着一种坚定、清澈、阴沉的眼神，那种眼神也许紧跟着就会招来一顿打。那眼神与其说含着命令不如说含着蔑视，可是我看到詹姆斯·莫尔居然接受了，我觉得很惊讶。很明显他已经被女儿狠狠说过一顿了，而且我看得出这个女孩肯定比我想象得要厉害，而这个男人的雅量也出乎我的预料。","This carried me home again at once, where I found the mails drawn out and ready fastened by the door, and the father and daughter with every mark upon them of a recent disagreement.Catriona was like a wooden doll; James More breathed hard, his face was dotted with white spots, and his nose upon one side.As soon as I came in, the girl looked at him with a steady, clear, dark look that might have been followed by a blow.It was a hint that was more contemptuous than a command, and I was surprised to see James More accept it.It was plain he had had a master talking-to; and I could see there must be more of the devil in the girl than I had guessed, and more good humour about the man than I had given him the credit of."
"至少，他开始称呼我鲍尔弗先生了，而且很坦率地从受到的教训开始说起。不过他没有说太多，因为他的声音刚因为傲慢有点儿提高，卡特里奥娜就插话了。","He began, at least, calling me Mr. Balfour, and plainly speaking from a lesson; but he got not very far, for at the first pompous swell of his voice, Catriona cut in."
"“我来告诉你詹姆斯·莫尔的意思是什么，”她说，“他的意思是我们跑来找你，就像乞丐一样，而且我们对你不是很好，我们为自己的忘恩负义和无礼行为深感羞愧。现在我们正想走，也希望你忘记我们。可是我父亲钱财使用不当，所以如果你不给我们再多一些施舍的话，我们连这一点都无法做到。因为我们就是那样的人，不管怎么说，就是乞丐和食客而已。”","“I will tell you what James More is meaning,” said she.“He means we have come to you, beggar-folk, and have not behaved to you very well, and we are ashamed of our ingratitude and ill-behaviour.Now we are wanting to go away and be forgotten; and my father will have guided his gear so ill, that we cannot even do that unless you will give us some more alms.For that is what we are, at an events, beggar-folk and sorners.”"
"“对不起，德拉蒙德小姐，”我说，“我必须亲自和你父亲谈谈。”","“By your leave, Miss Drummond,” said I, “I must speak to your father by myself.”"
"她一言不发，也不多看一眼，就走进自己的房间并关上了门。","She went into her own room and shut the door, without a word or a look."
"“你要原谅她，鲍尔弗先生，”詹姆斯·莫尔说，“她根本不懂礼数。”","“You must excuse her, Mr. Balfour,” says James More.“She has no delicacy.”"
"“我到这里来不是为了和你讨论那一点的，”我说，“而是来打发你走的。为此，我必须谈谈你的处境。现在，德拉蒙德先生，我对你的事情所给予的关照已经比你原来要求的还多了。我知道你在问我借钱的时候，自己其实还有钱。我知道自从到莱登以后，你的钱还更多了，虽然你甚至对你女儿都隐瞒了这一点。”","“I am not here to discuss that with you,” said I, “but to be quit of you.And to that end I must talk of your position.Now, Mr. Drummond, I have kept the run of your affairs more closely than you bargained for.I know you had money of your own when you were borrowing mine.I know you have had more since you were here in Leyden, though you concealed it even from your daughter.”"
"“我请你说话注意一点儿。我再也不会上钩了，”他爆发了，“我讨厌她，也讨厌你。对于作父亲的来说，这是怎样一桩该死的交易啊！我已经知道该用什么话来形容我了——”说到这里他突然停了下来。“先生，这既是一颗战士的心，也是一颗父亲的心。”他把手放在胸口继续说道，“作为这两种身份我都受到了伤害——我请你说话注意一点儿。”","“I bid you beware.I will stand no more baiting,” he broke out.“I am sick of her and you.What kind of a damned trade is this to be a parent!I have had expressions used to me—”There he broke off.“Sir, this is the heart of a soldier and a parent,” he went on again, laying his hand on his bosom, “outraged in both characters—and I bid you beware.”"
"“如果你让我把话说完，”我说，“你会发现我说的对你有好处。”","“If you would have let me finish,” says I, “you would have found I spoke for your advantage.”"
"“我亲爱的朋友，”他叫道，“我知道我也许仰仗了你慷慨好施的性格。”","“My dear friend,” he cried, “I know I might have relied upon the generosity of your character.”"
"“老兄！你能让我说说话吗？”我说，“事实上我根本无法发现你是富还是穷。但是我的想法是，你的钱由于来路神秘，所以数量还是有点儿不够。但我决定不让你的女儿缺钱花。如果我敢和她本人说的话，你可以肯定我是绝对不会托付给你的，因为我对你了如指掌，你这些虚夸的高谈阔论对我而言都是空话。然而，我相信你这样做终究是出于对女儿的关心。我现在的做法都以此信念为基础，事情就是这样。”","“Man! will you let me speak?” said I.“The fact is that I cannot win to find out if you are rich or poor.But it is my idea that your means, as they are mysterious in their source, so they are something insufficient in amount; and I do not choose your daughter to be lacking.If I durst speak to herself, you may be certain I would never dream of trusting it to you; because I know you like the back of my hand, and all your blustering talk is that much wind to me.However, I believe in your way you do still care something for your daughter after all; and I must just be doing with that ground of confidence, such as it is.”"
"随后，我和他约好让他和我联系，至于说他的着落和卡特里奥娜的生活保障，我都考虑到了，并给了他一小笔生活补贴。","Whereupon, I arranged with him that he was to communicate with me, as to his whereabouts and Catriona’s welfare, in consideration of which I was to serve him a small stipend."
"他非常热心地听我说出对这件事情的安排。在我说完以后，他大声叫喊道：“我亲爱的朋友，我亲爱的孩子，这比其他任何事情都更像你的做派！我会像战士一样忠诚地待你——”","He heard the business out with a great deal of eagerness; and when it was done, “My dear fellow, my dear son,” he cried out, “this is more like yourself than any of it yet!I will serve you with a soldier’s faithfulness—”"
"“别再让我听到这些话！”我说，“你已经让我烦透了，一听到‘战士’这个词我就倒胃口。我们的交易已经谈妥，我现在出去，半小时以后回来，到时候我希望你已经从我的房间消失了。”","“Let me hear no more of it!” says I.“You have got me to that pitch that the bare name of soldier rises on my stomach.Our traffic is settled; I am now going forth and will return in one half-hour, when I expect to find my chambers purged of you.”"
"我给了他们充裕的时间。我担心的一点就是怕我会再次见到卡特里奥娜，因为泪水和柔情都已在我心中，而我还怀有怒气，像是在保持那一点点尊严。也许一个小时过去了。太阳已经落山，一弯细细的新月紧随其后，跃然挂在黄昏那片腥红色的天幕上，东边也已经有星星闪烁了。最后当我进入我的房间时，已经入夜。我点燃一根细蜡烛，审视着各个房间。在第一间房里，我并没有发现能唤醒我对远去之人的回忆的东西，但是在第二间房间地板的一个角落里，我发现了一小堆东西，霎时我的心都跳到嗓子眼上了。她离开的时候把我曾经给她的所有东西都留了下来。这个打击让我内心一阵痛楚，也许因为这是最后一次心痛了，我扑倒在那堆衣物上，举止痴傻让我无法言说。","I gave them good measure of time; it was my one fear that I might see Catriona again, because tears and weakness were ready in my heart, and I cherished my anger like a piece of dignity.Perhaps an hour went by; the sun had gone down, a little wisp of a new moon was following it across a scarlet sunset; already there were stars in the east, and in my chambers, when at last I entered them, the night lay blue.I lit a taper and reviewed the rooms; in the first there remained nothing so much as to awake a memory of those who were gone; but in the second, in a corner of the floor, I spied a little heap that brought my heart into my mouth.She had left behind at her departure all that she had ever had of me.It was the blow that I felt sorest, perhaps because it was the last; and I fell upon that pile of clothing and behaved myself more foolish than I care to tell of."
"夜深了，严霜凛冽，我的牙齿咯咯作响，我再次恢复了一点儿男子汉的气概，开始反思自己。看见那些凌乱的衣裙和缎带，还有她更换的衣服，以及那些绣花长袜，我再也无法忍受。如果我想恢复自己坚定的意志，我清楚自己必须在清晨前处理好这一切。我的第一个念头就是一把火烧了它们，但是一方面我秉性一贯反对浪费，另一方面把这些她贴身穿过的东西都烧掉似乎也太狠心了。房间的角落里有个衣橱，我决定把它们全收进去。我就这么做了，为此花了很长时间，虽然叠衣服的确不需要什么技巧，但我叠得非常仔细，而且时不时地我的眼泪就会滴落在上面。我魂不守舍，身体疲惫不堪，仿佛跑了几英里一样，而且像受到打击那般痛楚。当我叠着一条她经常围在脖子上的方巾时，我注意到方巾的一角被整整齐齐地剪掉了。那是一条颜色很漂亮的方巾，我曾经常夸赞其色彩亮丽。我记得有一次她围着这条方巾，我还跟她说（以开玩笑的方式）她围了我的颜色。霎时闪现了一线希望，就像是一股暖流涌上心头，可顷刻间我又陷入新的绝望中。因为那角方巾被皱巴巴地揉成一团，扔在了地板上的另一个地方。","Late in the night, in a strict frost, and my teeth chattering, I came again by some portion of my manhood and considered with myself.The sight of these poor frocks and ribbons, and her shifts, and the clocked stockings, was not to be endured; and if I were to recover any constancy of mind, I saw I must be rid of them ere the morning.It was my first thought to have made a fire and burned them; but my disposition has always been opposed to wastery, for one thing; and for another, to have burned these things that she had worn so close upon her body seemed in the nature of a cruelty.There was a corner cupboard in that chamber; there I determined to bestow them.The which I did and made it a long business, folding them with very little skill indeed but the more care; and sometimes dropping them with my tears.All the heart was gone out of me, I was weary as though I had run miles, and sore like one beaten; when, as I was folding a kerchief that she wore often at her neck, I observed there was a corner neatly cut from it.It was a kerchief of a very pretty hue, on which I had frequently remarked; and once that she had it on, I remembered telling her (by way of a banter) that she wore my colours.There came a glow of hope and like a tide of sweetness in my bosom; and the next moment I was plunged back in a fresh despair.For there was the corner crumpled in a knot and cast down by itself in another part of the floor."
"但是当我和自己辩解时，我又开始充满希望了。她颇为孩子气地剪下那块方巾角显示了她的柔情，不过她又把它给扔掉了，这却有点儿令人费解。我更倾向于第一种想法而不是第二种，那样我会更加高兴，因为与其担心她是出于一时的怨恨而把它给扔掉了，倒不如想想她曾经想过要留作纪念的。","But when I argued with myself, I grew more hopeful.She had cut that corner off in some childish freak that was manifestly tender; that she had cast it away again was little to be wondered at; and I was inclined to dwell more upon the first than upon the second, and to be more pleased that she had ever conceived the idea of that keepsake, than concerned because she had flung it from her in an hour of natural resentment."
"第二十九章 我们在敦刻尔克会面","CHAPTER XXIX—WE MEET IN DUNKIRK."
"总之，在随后的日子里，我很少再那么痛苦难受，而是拥有了许多充满希望和快乐的时光。我全身心地投入到不懈的学习中，以此熬过了艾伦来之前的那段时间，也可以通过詹姆斯·莫尔得知卡特里奥娜的消息。我们分开的那段时间我总共收到过三封信。一封信告诉我他们已经到达法国的敦刻尔克镇，没过多久，詹姆斯就独自因私事离开了那里。他那是去英国会见霍尔德内斯大人，我大笔的钱竟然用于帮他支付这类费用，我想到这一点就难受。但是与恶人交往，或者说和詹姆斯·莫尔交往也一样，必须要特别提防。他外出离开的这段时间，我如期收到了他的另一封信。那封信提到了给他的生活补贴的使用情况。他处事很小心，事先就写好了信，然后留给卡特里奥娜寄出的。我们通信之事引起了她的怀疑，所以他刚一离开她就拆开了信的封签。因此，我收到的信开始是詹姆斯·莫尔的笔迹：","Altogether, then, I was scare so miserable the next days but what I had many hopeful and happy snatches; threw myself with a good deal of constancy upon my studies; and made out to endure the time till Alan should arrive, or I might hear word of Catriona by the means of James More.I had altogether three letters in the time of our separation.One was to announce their arrival in the town of Dunkirk in France, from which place James shortly after started alone upon a private mission.This was to England and to see Lord Holderness; and it has always been a bitter thought that my good money helped to pay the charges of the same.But he has need of a long spoon who soups with the de’il, or James More either.During this absence, the time was to fall due for another letter; and as the letter was the condition of his stipend, he had been so careful as to prepare it beforehand and leave it with Catriona to be despatched.The fact of our correspondence aroused her suspicions, and he was no sooner gone than she had burst the seal.What I received began accordingly in the writing of James More:"
"“我亲爱的先生，承蒙眷顾，汇款已经如期收到，我要为遵照协议寄来的这笔款项表示感谢。所有款项均会如实用在我的女儿身上，她很好，也希望她亲爱的朋友会记得她。我发现她心情相当忧郁，但相信上帝的仁慈会令她恢复。我们的生活方式非常孤单，不过我们可以哼唱家乡山区那忧郁的歌曲来聊以自慰，还可以在海边散步，那大海紧邻着苏格兰。对我来说，带着身上的五处伤躺在格拉德斯莫田野上的那些时日更加美好。我已经在一家法国贵族的养马场里找到事做了，在这里我的经验受到了重视。但是，我亲爱的先生，薪酬却极度不相称，我都不好意思说起。所以你的汇款对我女儿过舒适的生活显得更加有必要了，尽管我想老朋友的看法还是会更好一些。","“My dear Sir,—Your esteemed favour came to hand duly, and I have to acknowledge the inclosure according to agreement.It shall be all faithfully expended on my daughter, who is well, and desires to be remembered to her dear friend.I find her in rather a melancholy disposition, but trust in the mercy of God to see her re-established.Our manner of life is very much alone, but we solace ourselves with the melancholy tunes of our native mountains, and by walking up the margin of the sea that lies next to Scotland.It was better days with me when I lay with five wounds upon my body on the field of Gladsmuir.I have found employment here in the haras of a French nobleman, where my experience is valued.But, my dear Sir, the wages are so exceedingly unsuitable that I would be ashamed to mention them, which makes your remittances the more necessary to my daughter’s comfort, though I daresay the sight of old friends would be still better."
"“我亲爱的先生，你真挚、顺从的仆人，詹姆斯·麦格雷戈·德拉蒙德”","“My dear Sir,“Your affectionate, obedient servant,“JAMES MACGREGOR DRUMMOND.”"
"下面接着又变成了卡特里奥娜的笔迹。","Below it began again in the hand of Catriona:-"
"“不要相信他，这一切都是谎言——卡特里奥娜·麦格雷戈·德拉蒙德”","“Do not be believing him, it is all lies together,—C. M. D.”"
"她不仅增加了这句附言，而且我觉得她肯定已经把这封信压了一阵子，因为这封信在预定的时间过了很久才收到，而且紧跟着就收到了第三封信。在这两封信的中间，艾伦到了，和他愉快的交谈给我带来了另外一种生活。他把我介绍给他苏格兰裔荷兰籍的堂兄，那个人酒量之大超乎我想象，而除此之外他别无其他的兴趣。我多次受邀参加愉快的晚宴，我也回请过一些，但这一切对我的悲伤却于事无补。我们两个人（我是指艾伦和我自己，根本不算那位堂兄）就我和詹姆斯·莫尔父女之间的实质关系讨论了很多。我自然不好意思详述细节，不过艾伦并没有因为我这么做而打算对此事少评论一些。","Not only did she add this postscript, but I think she must have come near suppressing the letter; for it came long after date, and was closely followed by the third.In the time betwixt them, Alan had arrived, and made another life to me with his merry conversation; I had been presented to his cousin of the Scots-Dutch, a man that drank more than I could have thought possible and was not otherwise of interest; I had been entertained to many jovial dinners and given some myself, all with no great change upon my sorrow; and we two (by which I mean Alan and myself, and not at all the cousin) had discussed a good deal the nature of my relations with James More and his daughter.I was naturally diffident to give particulars; and this disposition was not anyway lessened by the nature of Alan’s commentary upon those I gave."
"“我对这件事情还摸不清头脑，”他说，“但是给我的印象就是你已经把自己弄成个呆子了。没有几个人会比我艾伦·布雷克更有经验，但我根本不记得听说过像你这位一样的少女。从你说的情况来看，这件事情不大可能成。戴维，你肯定把事情弄得一团糟了。”","“I cannae make heed nor tail of it,” he would say, “but it sticks in my mind ye’ve made a gowk of yourself.There’s few people that has had more experience than Alan Breck: and I can never call to mind to have heard tell of a lassie like this one of yours.The way that you tell it, the thing’s fair impossible.Ye must have made a terrible hash of the business, David.”"
"“有时我也和你的想法一样。”我说。","“There are whiles that I am of the same mind,” said I."
"“奇怪的是你对她好像还有几分迷恋啊！”艾伦说。","“The strange thing is that ye seem to have a kind of fancy for her too!” said Alan."
"“是刻骨铭心，艾伦，”我说，“我觉得我会把这份感情一直带到坟墓里去。”","“The biggest kind, Alan,” said I, “and I think I’ll take it to my grave with me.”"
"“好，我说不过你，随你便吧！”他总结说。","“Well, ye beat me, whatever!” he would conclude."
"我给他看了卡特里奥娜写有附言的那封信。“又来了！”他叫道，“不能否认这位卡特里奥娜处事还得体，而且很有见地！至于说詹姆斯·莫尔，这个人就像鼓一样，其实腹内空空、外强中干。不过我绝不否认他在格拉德斯莫战役中的战斗的确很英勇，而且他所说的身受五处伤也是实话。但是他已经失去首领的地位了。”","I showed him the letter with Catriona’s postscript.“And here again!” he cried.“Impossible to deny a kind of decency to this Catriona, and sense forby!As for James More, the man’s as boss as a drum; he’s just a wame and a wheen words; though I’ll can never deny that he fought reasonably well at Gladsmuir, and it’s true what he says here about the five wounds.But the loss of him is that the man’s boss.”"
"“你看，艾伦，”我说，“把那位少女留在如此卑鄙的人的手中，这确实有违我的本意。”","“Ye see, Alan,” said I, “it goes against the grain with me to leave the maid in such poor hands.”"
"“你找不到比他更卑鄙的人了。”他承认道，“但是你打算如何处理这件事？你要知道，戴维，男女之间的事情就是这样的。那些女人根本就是不可理喻的。她们要么喜欢一个男人，那这个人就一切都好；要不然她们就讨厌他，那你就可以省省力气了——你做什么都白搭。她们具有双面性——为你卖掉自己大衣的是她们，走在路上对你瞧都不瞧一眼的也是她们。女人就是那个样子，而你似乎就是一个大傻瓜，连好坏都分不清。”","“Ye couldnae weel find poorer,” he admitted.“But what are ye to do with it?It’s this way about a man and a woman, ye see, Davie: The weemenfolk have got no kind of reason to them.Either they like the man, and then a’ goes fine; or else they just detest him, and ye may spare your breath—ye can do naething.There’s just the two sets of them—them that would sell their coats for ye, and them that never look the road ye’re on.That’s a’ that there is to women; and you seem to be such a gomeral that ye cannae tell the tane frae the tither.”"
"“是啊，恐怕对我来说还真是如此。”我说。","“Well, and I’m afraid that’s true for me,” said I."
"“然而没有比这更容易的事了！”艾伦叫道，“我能够轻松教你知道事情的真相。但是在我看来你好像天生看不见似的，而这正是困难所在。”","“And yet there’s naething easier!” cried Alan.“I could easy learn ye the science of the thing; but ye seem to me to be born blind, and there’s where the deefficulty comes in.”"
"“难道你就不能帮帮我吗？”我问道，“你不正擅长于此吗？”","“And can you no help me?”I asked, “you that are so clever at the trade?”"
"“你要明白，戴维，我当时可没在这里。”他说，“我就像一个战地指挥官，手下除了一个瞎子再没别的人可派去侦察。那他能看到什么呢？不过我印象很深的却是，你有点儿过于没用了。我要是你的话，我就会再找她试试看。”","“Ye see, David, I wasnae here,” said he.“I’m like a field officer that has naebody but blind men for scouts and éclaireurs; and what would he ken?But it sticks in my mind that ye’ll have made some kind of bauchle; and if I was you I would have a try at her again.”"
"“你会这样做吗，艾伦伙计？”我说。","“Would ye so, man Alan?” said I."
"“我当然会。”他说。","“I would e’en’t,” says he."
"第三封信到我手里的时候，我们正在进行此类深谈，而你们以后将会看到这封信来得正是时候。詹姆斯声称有些担心他女儿的健康，我却认为他女儿再健康不过了。他在信里说尽了我的好话，最后提议说我应该去敦刻尔克看望他们。","The third letter came to my hand while we were deep in some such talk: and it will be seen how pat it fell to the occasion.James professed to be in some concern upon his daughter’s health, which I believe was never better; abounded in kind expressions to myself; and finally proposed that I should visit them at Dunkirk."
"“现在你正享受着和我的老伙伴斯图尔特先生相伴的乐趣吧。”他写道，“为何不陪他一起回法国一趟呢？我有一些很特别的消息要说给斯图尔特先生听。无论如何，能和一位老战友、一位同样有勇气的人见面，我会很高兴的。至于你，我亲爱的先生，我和我女儿会为能接待我们的恩人而感到骄傲，我们把你视为儿子和兄弟。事实证明那位法国贵族是一个最为卑劣贪婪之徒，所以我必须得离开那家养马场了。因此，你会发现我们有点儿落魄地寄居在在沙丘上一个名叫巴赞的男子开的客栈里。但是情况变得更明朗了，我毫不怀疑我们会一起度过一些非常愉快的日子，到时我和斯图尔特先生可以回忆我们的军旅生活，而我女儿和你可以按照更适合你们这个年龄的方式自娱自乐。至少我请求斯图尔特先生务必来访，我找他有事，所以将敞开大门欢迎他来。”","“You will now be enjoying the society of my old comrade Mr. Stewart,” he wrote.“Why not accompany him so far in his return to France?I have something very particular for Mr. Stewart’s ear; and, at any rate, I would be pleased to meet in with an old fellow-soldier and one so mettle as himself.As for you, my dear sir, my daughter and I would be proud to receive our benefactor, whom we regard as a brother and a son.The French nobleman has proved a person of the most filthy avarice of character, and I have been necessitate to leave the haras.You will find us in consequence a little poorly lodged in the auberge of a man Bazin on the dunes; but the situation is caller, and I make no doubt but we might spend some very pleasant days, when Mr. Stewart and I could recall our services, and you and my daughter divert yourselves in a manner more befitting your age.I beg at least that Mr. Stewart would come here; my business with him opens a very wide door.”"
"“这个人想找我做什么？”读到这里时，艾伦叫道，“他想找你要的已经够清楚了——就是钱。但是他想找艾伦·布雷克要什么呢？”","“What does the man want with me?” cried Alan, when he had read.“What he wants with you in clear enough—it’s siller.But what can he want with Alan Breck?”"
"“哦，那只是个借口，”我说，“他还是在撮合这桩婚姻，我内心也希望我们能够修成正果。而他邀请你是因为他以为没有你我就不太可能去。”","“O, it’ll be just an excuse,” said I.“He is still after this marriage, which I wish from my heart that we could bring about.And he asks you because he thinks I would be less likely to come wanting you.”"
"“好吧，但愿我明白了。”艾伦说，“我和他从来都不对路，我们过去常像一对风笛手那样互相咧嘴一笑而已。‘吹点儿什么让我听听！’他这么说。我想这件事背后另有文章，以后我们会弄清楚的。哎呀，我在想，去看看他到底想干什么也挺好玩的！而且到时候还可以见见你的那位姑娘。你觉得怎么样，戴维？你愿和艾伦一起骑马去吗？”","“Well, I wish that I kent,” says Alan.“Him and me were never onyways pack; we used to girn at ither like a pair of pipers.‘Something for my ear,’ quo’ he!I’ll maybe have something for his hinder-end, before we’re through with it.Dod, I’m thinking it would be a kind of divertisement to gang and see what he’ll be after!Forby that I could see your lassie then.What say ye, Davie?Will ye ride with Alan?”"
"你们可以肯定我是不会退缩的，而艾伦的假期即将休完，所以我们马上就一起踏上了冒险之旅。","You may be sure I was not backward, and Alan’s furlough running towards an end, we set forth presently upon this joint adventure."
"那是一月份的一天傍晚，我们终于骑马到了敦刻尔克城。我们在柱子上拴好马，找了一个向导带我们去巴赞的旅馆，那个旅馆位于城墙外。夜已经很深，所以我们是最后出城的人，我们过桥的时候就听到城门在背后关上了。身前是一片灯火辉煌的市郊，我们花了好一会儿工夫才穿过去，随后我们拐进了一条黑暗的小巷，不久就发现我们在黑夜中正涉沙而行，还能够听到海浪的拍岸声。我们就这样走了一段时间，几乎都是靠听声音来跟着向导走的。于是我开始想他也许给我们带错路了，这时我们来到了一个小斜坡的顶部，然后看到黑暗中有一扇窗户里透出一丝微弱的灯光。","It was near dark of a January day when we rode at last into the town of Dunkirk.We left our horses at the post, and found a guide to Bazin’s Inn, which lay beyond the walls.Night was quite fallen, so that we were the last to leave that fortress, and heard the doors of it close behind us as we passed the bridge.On the other side there lay a lighted suburb, which we thridded for a while, then turned into a dark lane, and presently found ourselves wading in the night among deep sand where we could hear a bullering of the sea.We travelled in this fashion for some while, following our conductor mostly by the sound of his voice; and I had begun to think he was perhaps misleading us, when we came to the top of a small brae, and there appeared out of the darkness a dim light in a window."
"“瞧，那就是巴赞客栈。”向导说。","“Voilà l’auberge à Bazin,” says the guide."
"艾伦咂了咂嘴。“也太偏僻了一点儿。”他说，听他的语气我觉得他不大满意。","Alan smacked his lips.“An unco lonely bit,” said he, and I thought by his tone he was not wholly pleased."
"不一会儿，我们已站在那栋房子的底层了，整个底层都在一套公寓里，边上有楼梯通往客房，靠墙摆着长椅子和桌子，有一边尽头是炉火，另一边尽头是一排排的酒瓶和地窖门。那位巴赞是一个样貌丑陋的大个子男人，他告诉我们那位苏格兰绅士出门了，他不知道去了哪里，不过那位年轻的女士在上面，他会上去叫她下来见我们。","A little after, and we stood in the lower storey of that house, which was all in the one apartment, with a stairs leading to the chambers at the side, benches and tables by the wall, the cooking fire at the one end of it, and shelves of bottles and the cellar-trap at the other.Here Bazin, who was an ill-looking, big man, told us the Scottish gentleman was gone abroad he knew not where, but the young lady was above, and he would call her down to us."
"我从胸前掏出那块缺了角的方巾，然后在我的颈部打了个结。我可以听见自己的心跳，而艾伦则带着有点儿好笑的表情拍着我的肩膀，我差点儿忍不住要训他一顿了。但是并没有等多长时间。我听到她的脚步声从头顶走过，接着看见她出现在楼梯上。她非常平静地走了下来，脸色苍白地跟我打了招呼，显得有点儿拘谨，或者有点儿不安，她那种态度让我特别沮丧。","I took from my breast that kerchief wanting the corner, and knotted it about my throat.I could hear my heart go; and Alan patting me on the shoulder with some of his laughable expressions, I could scarce refrain from a sharp word.But the time was not long to wait.I heard her step pass overhead, and saw her on the stair.This she descended very quietly, and greeted me with a pale face and a certain seeming of earnestness, or uneasiness, in her manner that extremely dashed me."
"“我父亲，詹姆斯·莫尔很快就会回来。他看见你会很高兴的。”她说。然后突然她满脸通红，两眼发亮，话就停在了嘴边。我确信她看见那块方巾了。她只是慌乱了一小会儿，但是我认为她是带着新的兴奋心情转身去欢迎艾伦的。“你就是他的朋友艾伦·布雷克？”她叫道，“我无数遍听他谈起过你。我对你的勇敢和善良仰慕已久了。”","“My father, James More, will be here soon.He will be very pleased to see you,” she said.And then of a sudden her face flamed, her eyes lightened, the speech stopped upon her lips; and I made sure she had observed the kerchief.It was only for a breath that she was discomposed; but methought it was with a new animation that she turned to welcome Alan.“And you will be his friend, Alan Breck?” she cried.“Many is the dozen times I will have heard him tell of you; and I love you already for all your bravery and goodness.”"
"“好，好，”艾伦说，一边握着她的手在打量着她，“这么说，我终于见到这位年轻的女士了！戴维，你的描述能力也太差劲了。”","“Well, well,” says Alan, holding her hand in his and viewing her, “and so this is the young lady at the last of it!David, ye’re an awful poor hand of a description.”"
"我不知道我曾否听他说话如此扣人心扉，他的声音听起来就像在唱歌。","I do not know that ever I heard him speak so straight to people’s hearts; the sound of his voice was like song."
"“什么！他曾经向你描述过我吗？”她叫道。","“What? will he have been describing me?” she cried."
"“自从我出法国以后听说过一点儿！”他说，“此外还听说过一点儿，那是在苏格兰的一个夜晚，在银磨坊边的小树林里。但是你要高兴一点儿，亲爱的！你比他说的要漂亮多了。现在有一件事可以肯定，我和你一定会成为一对好朋友的。我现在有一点儿像是戴维的随从，我就像一个小孩紧跟在他身后。他关心什么，我就会关心什么——全靠神圣的主啊！他们都会关心我的! 所以现在你知道该怎样和艾伦·布雷克相处了，而且你会发现在这种交往中你几乎不会有损失。他虽然不是很俊美，但他对他所爱的人却很忠实。”","“Little else of it since I ever came out of France!” says he, “forby a bit of a speciment one night in Scotland in a shaw of wood by Silvermills.But cheer up, my dear!ye’re bonnier than what he said.And now there’s one thing sure; you and me are to be a pair of friends.I’m a kind of a henchman to Davie here; I’m like a tyke at his heels; and whatever he cares for, I’ve got to care for too—and by the holy airn! they will care for me! So now you can see what way you stand with Alan Breck, and ye’ll find ye’ll hardly lose on the transaction.He’s no very bonnie, my dear, but he’s leal to them he loves.”"
"“我从内心感谢你的这番好话。”她说，“我尊敬勇敢诚实的人，我都找不到任何话来答谢你。”","“I thank you from my heart for your good words,” said she.“I have that honour for a brave, honest man that I cannot find any to be answering with.”"
"旅行者比较自由，因此我们有时间等待詹姆斯·莫尔，于是我们三个人坐下来一起吃饭。艾伦让卡特里奥娜坐在他身旁，尽心服侍着她：他先从他的玻璃杯中倒酒给她喝，他一直友善殷勤地围着她转，却从不会让我有任何嫉妒的机会，他自顾自不停地说了很多话，说话的口气那么快乐，让我和她都忘记了尴尬。要是有人看见我们当时的情形，肯定会认为艾伦是老朋友而我是陌生人。的确，我经常喜欢并羡慕着这个家伙，但我从来没有像那天晚上那么喜欢和羡慕他。我不由对自己说（有时我颇有忘记的危险）他不仅有很多生活经验，除此之外他还以自己的方式表现出很强的天赋能力。至于卡特里奥娜，她好像完全忘乎所以了，她的笑声像响亮的铃声，她的脸如五月的清晨一样清丽。而我自己，虽然也很高兴，却也有一点点忧愁，觉得和我的朋友一比较，自己既木讷又愚笨，所以很不适合进入年轻女孩的生活，也许反而会减少她的快乐。","Using travellers’ freedom, we spared to wait for James More, and sat down to meat, we threesome.Alan had Catriona sit by him and wait upon his wants: he made her drink first out of his glass, he surrounded her with continual kind gallantries, and yet never gave me the most small occasion to be jealous; and he kept the talk so much in his own hand, and that in so merry a note, that neither she nor I remembered to be embarrassed.If any had seen us there, it must have been supposed that Alan was the old friend and I the stranger.Indeed, I had often cause to love and to admire the man, but I never loved or admired him better than that night; and I could not help remarking to myself (what I was sometimes rather in danger of forgetting) that he had not only much experience of life, but in his own way a great deal of natural ability besides.As for Catriona, she seemed quite carried away; her laugh was like a peal of bells, her face gay as a May morning; and I own, although I was well pleased, yet I was a little sad also, and thought myself a dull, stockish character in comparison of my friend, and very unfit to come into a young maid’s life, and perhaps ding down her gaiety."
"不过如果说那是我所处的位置的话，至少我发现自己也并不孤独，因为詹姆斯·莫尔突然回来了，那个女孩就变成了一块石头。随后的整个晚上，我的眼睛不停地在注视着她，直到她找了个借口回去睡觉了。我可以证明她后来再也没有笑过，也很少说话，大多数时间都只是看着她眼前的桌面。所以我真的非常惊讶，她居然从那么专注热诚（就像刚才那样）变得满心厌恶和憎恨。","But if that was like to be my part, I found that at least I was not alone in it; for, James More returning suddenly, the girl was changed into a piece of stone.Through the rest of that evening, until she made an excuse and slipped to bed, I kept an eye upon her without cease; and I can bear testimony that she never smiled, scarce spoke, and looked mostly on the board in front of her.So that I really marvelled to see so much devotion (as it used to be) changed into the very sickness of hate."
"关于詹姆斯·莫尔，我毋庸赘言，你们已经知道这个人，对他的本性也已经了解，而且我也厌倦了去写他的那些谎言。他那天喝得太多，没有跟我们说几句任何有用途的话。至于他要和艾伦说的事情，就只有留待次日再和他私下交流了。","Of James More it is unnecessary to say much; you know the man already, what there was to know of him; and I am weary of writing out his lies.Enough that he drank a great deal, and told us very little that was to any possible purpose.As for the business with Alan, that was to be reserved for the morrow and his private hearing."
"要推诿是很容易的，因为我和艾伦骑了四天的马，都非常疲倦了，所以卡特里奥娜走后我们没有坐多久。","It was the more easy to be put off, because Alan and I were pretty weary with four day’s ride, and sat not very late after Catriona."
"很快我们就单独进了一个房间，那里面只有一张单人床让我们临时凑合着睡。艾伦带着奇怪的微笑看着我。","We were soon alone in a chamber where we were to make-shift with a single bed.Alan looked on me with a queer smile."
"“你这个大傻瓜！”他说。","“Ye muckle ass!” said he."
"“你那么说是什么意思？”我叫道。","“What do ye mean by that?” I cried."
"“什么意思？我是什么意思！真是奇怪，戴维伙计。”他说，“你真是蠢到家了。”","“Mean?What do I mean!It’s extraordinar, David man,” say he, “that you should be so mortal stupit.”"
"我再次求他说出来。","Again I begged him to speak out."
"“那好，是这样的，”他说，“我告诉过你有两种女人——她们会为了你而卖掉自己的衣裙，但还有另外一种人的。你就为自己好好努力一番吧，我的俊小伙！不过你心里到底有什么打算呢？”","“Well, it’s this of it,” said he.“I told ye there were the two kinds of women—them that would sell their shifts for ye, and the others.Just you try for yoursel, my bonny man!But what’s that neepkin at your craig?”"
"我告诉了他。","I told him."
"“我觉得问题就出在这里。”他说。","“I thocht it was something thereabout” said he."
"尽管我缠着他磨了好长时间，但他不肯再多说一个字了。","Nor would he say another word though I besieged him long with importunities."
"第三十章 来自船上的信","CHAPTER XXX—THE LETTER FROM THE SHIP"
"白天我们发现，小客栈立在那里，显得尤其孤零零的。那个客栈紧紧贴着大海，而你根本就看不见，因为客栈四周都围绕着粗糙的沙丘。实际上，那里只有一样可以算是景致之类的东西，就是矗立在斜坡上方的一个风车的两片风叶，就像驴的两只耳朵，但是驴身却完全隐匿起来了。奇怪的是（起风了之后，因为起初风平浪静）居然看见风叶旋转了起来，随后隐身在小沙丘后面的这类巨大的风叶都旋转起来了。几乎没有大路从那里经过，但是有不少小路弯弯曲曲地从四面八方通向巴赞先生客栈的门。实际上，巴赞先生从事很多种行当，但没有一种是正当的，而他的客栈算是他生计中最好的了。走私者经常光顾这家客栈，打算渡海的政治间谍和已遭褫夺的人也来这里等待他们的行程。而我觉得很可能背后还有更严重的情况，因为在那个房子里可能有一家人被灭门，只是无人知晓罢了。","Daylight showed us how solitary the inn stood.It was plainly hard upon the sea, yet out of all view of it, and beset on every side with scabbit hills of sand.There was, indeed, only one thing in the nature of a prospect, where there stood out over a brae the two sails of a windmill, like an ass’s ears, but with the ass quite hidden.It was strange (after the wind rose, for at first it was dead calm) to see the turning and following of each other of these great sails behind the hillock.Scarce any road came by there; but a number of footways travelled among the bents in all directions up to Mr. Bazin’s door.The truth is, he was a man of many trades, not any one of them honest, and the position of his inn was the best of his livelihood.Smugglers frequented it; political agents and forfeited persons bound across the water came there to await their passages; and I daresay there was worse behind, for a whole family might have been butchered in that house and nobody the wiser."
"我睡得很少，而且极不安稳。离天亮还早，我就悄悄地从我的伙伴身边溜下床，在炉火边取暖或者在门前来回踱着步。破晓时阴霾浓重，但是过了一会儿，突然从西边刮来一阵风，把云猛地吹散，让阳光透射下来，而且驱使风车旋转了起来。阳光中带着些许春天的气息，或者说在我的心里是这样的。巨大的风叶一个接一个地从山丘后出现，这让我觉得饶有趣味。有时我可以听到机械装置嘎吱一响。一直到那天的八点半，我都觉得这片沉闷、荒凉的地方就像是天堂一般。","I slept little and ill.Long ere it was day, I had slipped from beside my bedfellow, and was warming myself at the fire or walking to and fro before the door.Dawn broke mighty sullen; but a little after, sprang up a wind out of the west, which burst the clouds, let through the sun, and set the mill to the turning.There was something of spring in the sunshine, or else it was in my heart; and the appearing of the great sails one after another from behind the hill, diverted me extremely.At times I could hear a creak of the machinery; and by half-past eight of the day, and I thought this dreary, desert place was like a paradise."
"随着日子一天天过去，却没有一个人来这里，我开始对所有这一切感到一种我无法解释的不安。我觉得不对劲，似乎会有麻烦。风车的风叶在小山后升了又降，就像是有人在窥视。这附近和这个房子的确都非常奇怪，居然把一位少女带到这里来居住，这简直离奇得让人无法想象。","For all which, as the day drew on and nobody came near, I began to be aware of an uneasiness that I could scarce explain.It seemed there was trouble afoot; the sails of the windmill, as they came up and went down over the hill, were like persons spying; and outside of all fancy, it was surely a strange neighbourhood and house for a young lady to be brought to dwell in."
"早餐时，我们去晚了，显然詹姆斯·莫尔处于某种危险或者是困扰之中。很明显艾伦也意识到这一点了，而且密切地观察他。这一边表现得口是心非，而另一边则保持着高度警惕，这让我如坐针毡。早餐刚一结束，詹姆斯似乎就开始道歉了。他在镇上有个私人约会（就是和那位他曾告诉过我的法国贵族），要到中午才回来，请我们谅解他。期间，他把他女儿远远地拉到房间的另一头，似乎很急切地说了些话，而她则半倾着身子在听。","At breakfast, which we took late, it was manifest that James More was in some danger or perplexity; manifest that Alan was alive to the same, and watched him close; and this appearance of duplicity upon the one side, and vigilance upon the other, held me on live coals.The meal was no sooner over than James seemed to come began to make apologies.He had an appointment of a private nature in the town (it was with the French nobleman, he told me), and we would please excuse him till about noon.Meanwhile he carried his daughter aside to the far end of the room, where he seemed to speak rather earnestly and she to listen with much inclination."
"“我对詹姆斯这个人越来越不喜欢了。”艾伦说，“詹姆斯这个人有些不对劲，虽然我不该为此感到奇怪，但是我艾伦·布雷克今天要留心他才是。戴维，我最好去见见你那位法国贵族。而且我想你也可以找到自己要做的事，就是去征求一下你那位姑娘的意见，为你们的恋情增添一些新意。你就明明白白地告诉她——跟她说你当初就是一个大傻瓜。然后，如果我是你，当然你也可以做得很自然，我就会向她编造谎言说我处于某种危险中，女人就喜欢那样。”","“I am caring less and less about this man James,” said Alan.“There’s something no right with the man James, and I shouldnae wonder but what Alan Breck would give an eye to him this day.I would like fine to see yon French nobleman, Davie; and I daresay you could find an employ to yoursel, and that would be to speir at the lassie for some news o’ your affair.Just tell it to her plainly—tell her ye’re a muckle ass at the off-set; and then, if I were you, and ye could do it naitural, I would just mint to her I was in some kind of a danger; a’ weemenfolk likes that.”"
"“我做不出，艾伦，我不可能做得很自然。”我说道，嘲弄似地模仿着他。","“I cannae lee, Alan, I cannae do it naitural,” says I, mocking him."
"“那你就更蠢了！”他说，“那么你可以告诉她是我建议你这么做的，她听了一定会笑的。那也不失为很好的办法，对此我不会觉得奇怪。但是看看你们这一对！要不是因为我对这位少女很有把握，而她也非常喜欢和信任艾伦的话，那我会觉得这件事都有点儿像在哄骗你了。”","“The more fool you!” says he.“Then ye’ll can tell her that I recommended it; that’ll set her to the laughing; and I wouldnae wonder but what that was the next best.But see to the pair of them!If I didnae feel just sure of the lassie, and that she was awful pleased and chief with Alan, I would think there was some kind of hocus-pocus about you.”"
"“那么，艾伦，她和你相处很开心吗？”我问。","“And is she so pleased with ye, then, Alan?” I asked."
"“她对我评价甚高，”他说，“而我不像你，我是那种分得清真假的人。 她是那么做的——她对艾伦评价甚高。的确如此！我自己对艾伦评价也很好。肖斯，如果你允许的话，我要从你那些事务中抽一会儿身，这样我可以看看詹姆斯在干什么。”","“She thinks a heap of me,” says he.“And I’m no like you: I’m one that can tell.That she does—she thinks a heap of Alan.And troth!I’m thinking a good deal of him mysel; and with your permission, Shaws, I’ll be getting a wee yont amang the bents, so that I can see what way James goes.”"
"他们相继离开，只剩下我独自一人在早餐桌边。詹姆斯去了敦刻尔克，艾伦尾随他而去，卡特里奥娜上楼回她自己的房间了。我很清楚她在尽量避免单独和我在一起。然而我为此却很不开心，满脑子想着在那些人回来之前要想办法让她跟我见一次面。总之，对我来说似乎最好是按照艾伦说的去做。如果我先到沙丘中看不见的地方，晴朗的早晨会吸引她前往，而一旦我在野外碰上她，那我可就称心如意了。","One after another went, till I was left alone beside the breakfast table; James to Dunkirk, Alan dogging him, Catriona up the stairs to her own chamber.I could very well understand how she should avoid to be alone with me; yet was none the better pleased with it for that, and bent my mind to entrap her to an interview before the men returned.Upon the whole, the best appeared to me to do like Alan.If I was out of view among the sandhills, the fine morning would decoy her forth; and once I had her in the open, I could please myself."
"说做就做。我到沙丘下隐蔽处没呆多长时间，她就在客栈的门口出现了。她环顾四周，（看见没人）就沿着一条直通海边的小路出发了，而我则跟在她后面。我不急着让她知道我在那里。她走得离我越远，我肯定她就越难以听到我行走时衣服的摩擦声。地面上全都是沙子，要悄无声息地跟着她还是很容易的。小路越走越高，最后来到了山丘之顶。于是我第一次看到了客栈藏身的这一片旷野有多荒凉。那里一个人都看不到，也看不见任何人的房子，只有巴赞的客栈和那个风车。再稍远一点儿，大海呈现在眼前，两三艘船漂在海面上，美丽如画。其中有一艘船靠得特别近，那是一艘很大的船。当我认出其海马的标志时，我产生了新的怀疑并觉得很吃惊。为什么一艘英国船会这么靠近法国？为什么艾伦被带到了这附近，而这个地方远得根本没有任何救援的希望？詹姆斯·莫尔的女儿当天会走向海边，这是偶然的，还是设计好的？","No sooner said than done; nor was I long under the bield of a hillock before she appeared at the inn door, looked here and there, and (seeing nobody) set out by a path that led directly seaward, and by which I followed her.I was in no haste to make my presence known; the further she went I made sure of the longer hearing to my suit; and the ground being all sandy it was easy to follow her unheard.The path rose and came at last to the head of a knowe.Thence I had a picture for the first time of what a desolate wilderness that inn stood hidden in; where was no man to be seen, nor any house of man, except just Bazin’s and the windmill.Only a little further on, the sea appeared and two or three ships upon it, pretty as a drawing.One of these was extremely close in to be so great a vessel; and I was aware of a shock of new suspicion, when I recognised the trim of the Seahorse.What should an English ship be doing so near in to France?Why was Alan brought into her neighbourhood, and that in a place so far from any hope of rescue? and was it by accident, or by design, that the daughter of James More should walk that day to the seaside?"
"在沙丘前我赶紧走上前去跟在她的后面，而且走上了海滩。这段路既长又荒凉，我中途看到有一只单人小战船给吊上去了，还有一个军官在指挥，他在沙滩上踱着步，像是在等候。我在大片的乱草丛中坐下，乱草把我掩蔽了起来。我寻思着下一步该做什么。卡特里奥娜径直走向那艘小船，那个军官礼貌地接待了她，他们一起说了几句话，我看见一封信转了手，接着卡特里奥娜就开始往回走。与此同时，那艘船驶离，向“海马”号开去，好像它就是为这一件事来欧洲大陆的。但是我注意到那位军官留了下来，他随即消失在荒野中。","Presently I came forth behind her in the front of the sandhills and above the beach.It was here long and solitary; with a man-o’-war’s boat drawn up about the middle of the prospect, and an officer in charge and pacing the sands like one who waited.I sat down where the rough grass a good deal covered me, and looked for what should follow.Catriona went straight to the boat; the officer met her with civilities; they had ten words together; I saw a letter changing hands; and there was Catriona returning.At the same time, as if this were all her business on the Continent, the boat shoved off and was headed for the Seahorse.But I observed the officer to remain behind and disappear among the bents."
"我不太喜欢这件事情，而且我对此考虑得越多就越不喜欢。那位军官是找艾伦呢，还是找卡特里奥娜呢？卡特里奥娜低着头走近了，她一直看着沙滩，形成了一幅如此温柔的画面，我真无法忍受去怀疑她的清白。接下来，她抬起脸认出了我。她似乎有点儿犹豫，然后再次走过来，不过走得更慢了，我想她的脸色已经变了。这么一想，我心中所有的一切——恐惧、怀疑、对朋友生命的关心——完全被淹没了。我站起身，满怀希望地站在那里等着她。","I liked the business little; and the more I considered of it, liked it less.Was it Alan the officer was seeking? or Catriona?She drew near with her head down, looking constantly on the sand, and made so tender a picture that I could not bear to doubt her innocence.The next, she raised her face and recognised me; seemed to hesitate, and then came on again, but more slowly, and I thought with a changed colour.And at that thought, all else that was upon my bosom—fears, suspicions, the care of my friend’s life—was clean swallowed up; and I rose to my feet and stood waiting her in a drunkenness of hope."
"她走近时，我对她说了声“早上好”，她镇定自若地回应了我。","I gave her “good morning” as she came up, which she returned with a good deal of composure."
"“你会原谅我跟踪了你吗？”我说。","“Will you forgive my having followed you?” said I."
"“我知道你总是出于一片好意。”她回答说，随后突然有点儿发作道，“但是你为什么总是给那个人钱！绝对不可以。”","“I know you are always meaning kindly,” she replied; and then, with a little outburst, “but why will you be sending money to that man!It must not be.”"
"“我从来都没有给过他，”我说，“而是给你的，这一点你很清楚。”","“I never sent it for him,” said I, “but for you, as you know well.”"
"“但你没有权利给我们中的任何一个,”她说，“戴维，这是不对的。”","“And you have no right to be sending it to either one of us,” she said.“David, it is not right.”"
"“这是不对，这完全错了。”我说，“我祈祷上帝会帮助这个愚笨的家伙（如果完全有可能的话）变得更好。卡特里奥娜，这种生活根本不适合你过。请原谅我这么说，但是那个人真不配当父亲来照顾你。”","“It is not, it is all wrong,” said I, “and I pray God he will help this dull fellow (if it be at all possible) to make it better.Catriona, this is no kind of life for you to lead; and I ask your pardon for the word, but yon man is no fit father to take care of you.”"
"“不要说起他，甚至不要提！”她这么叫道。","“Do not be speaking of him, even!” was her cry."
"“我不需要再说起他。我现在想到的不是他，哦，相信我！ ”我说，“我只考虑一件事。我现在已经独自在莱登呆这么长的时间了。我就是在学习的时候，都还在想着这件事。接着艾伦来了，我参加了他们的士兵盛宴，但是那个时候我还是在想着同一件事。有你在我身旁时，我想的还是和以前一样。卡特里奥娜，你看看我颈上的这条方巾！你曾经剪掉了一个角，然后把给它扔了。方巾上的颜色现在都是你的颜色，我把它们系在了心上。亲爱的，我不能没有你。哦，试着容忍我吧！”","“And I need speak of him no more; it is not of him that I am thinking, O, be sure of that!” says I.“I think of the one thing.I have been alone now this long time in Leyden; and when I was by way of at my studies, still I was thinking of that.Next Alan came, and I went among soldier-men to their big dinners; and still I had the same thought.And it was the same before, when I had her there beside me.Catriona, do you see this napkin at my throat!You cut a corner from it once and then cast it from you.They’re your colours now; I wear them in my heart.My dear, I cannot be wanting you.O, try to put up with me!”"
"我迈步走到她前面，阻拦她继续前行。","I stepped before her so as to intercept her walking on."
"“尽量宽容我，”我在说着，“尽量宽容我一点儿吧。”","“Try to put up with me,” I was saying, “try and bear me with a little.”"
"她还是一言不发，我内心涌上一阵恐惧，就像对死亡的恐惧一般。","Still she had never the word, and a fear began to rise in me like a fear of death."
"“卡特里奥娜，”我叫道，死死盯着她，“我又做错了吗？我完全失去机会了吗？”","“Catriona,” I cried, gazing on her hard, “is it a mistake again?Am I quite lost?”"
"她抬脸对着我，屏住了呼吸。","She raised her face to me, breathless."
"“你需要我，戴维，这是真的？”她说，我几乎听不见她说的话。","“Do you want me, Davie, truly?” said she, and I scarce could hear her say it."
"“我真的需要，”我说，“哦，你肯定知道——我真的需要。”","“I do that,” said I.“O, sure you know it—I do that.”"
"“我再也没有什么可以付出或者收回的了。”她说，“如果你想让我送你一件礼物的话，我从第一天起就已经完全是你的了！”她说。","“I have nothing left to give or to keep back,” said she.“I was all yours from the first day, if you would have had a gift of me!” she said,"
"当时我们在山坡顶上。那个地方风很大而且很显眼，即使从那艘英国船上都能看见我们。但我还是在她面前的沙滩上跪了下来，抱着她的双膝，爆发出一阵暴风雨般的哭声，我觉得那哭声都让自己崩溃了。我情绪激动、心乱如麻，我脑海中的所有思绪已经被完全打乱。我不知道自己身在何处。我已经忘记了自己为什么快乐，我只知道她弯下腰，我感觉到她拥我入怀，并用脸爱抚着我，还听见她急促地说了一些话。","This was on the summit of a brae; the place was windy and conspicuous, we were to be seen there even from the English ship; but I kneeled down before her in the sand, and embraced her knees, and burst into that storm of weeping that I thought it must have broken me.All thought was wholly beaten from my mind by the vehemency of my discomposure.I knew not where I was.I had forgot why I was happy; only I knew she stooped, and I felt her cherish me to her face and bosom, and heard her words out of a whirl."
"“戴维，”她说，“哦，戴维，你是这样想我的啊！你就是这样关心可怜的我！哦，戴维，戴维！”","“Davie,” she was saying, “O, Davie, is this what you think of me!Is it so that you were caring for poor me!O, Davie, Davie!”"
"说着，她也哭泣起来，我们的泪水在满心欢喜中融汇在一起。","With that she wept also, and our tears were commingled in a perfect gladness."
"可能直到那天的十点我才清醒地意识到何等的幸运已经降临到我的身上。和她相对而坐，握着她的手，凝视着她的面庞，我像孩子一样欢快大笑起来，呼唤着她那些好笑而可亲的名字。我从来没有见过像敦刻尔克的旷野这么美丽的地方。山丘上那些风车的风叶轻快地转动着，犹如奏响了一首乐曲。","It might have been ten in the day before I came to a clear sense of what a mercy had befallen me; and sitting over against her, with her hands in mine, gazed in her face, and laughed out loud for pleasure like a child, and called her foolish and kind names.I have never seen the place that looked so pretty as those bents by Dunkirk; and the windmill sails, as they bobbed over the knowe, were like a tune of music."
"要不是我偶然提起她父亲，把我们带回了现实，我都不知道这种忘记一切而沉浸于自己的世界的状态会持续多久。","I know not how much longer we might have continued to forget all else besides ourselves, had I not chanced upon a reference to her father, which brought us to reality."
"“我的小朋友，”我一遍又一遍地呼唤着她，很高兴用这样的声音唤回往昔的回忆，我的视线扫过她的脸庞，继而看向稍远的地方——“我的小朋友，现在你完全是我的。你永远是我的，我的小朋友，那个人再也不算什么了。”","“My little friend,” I was calling her again and again, rejoicing to summon up the past by the sound of it, and to gaze across on her, and to be a little distant—“My little friend, now you are mine altogether; mine for good, my little friend and that man’s no longer at all.”"
"她的脸倏地发白了，她从我手中抽回了自己的手。","There came a sudden whiteness in her face, she plucked her hands from mine."
"“戴维，带我离开他！”她叫道，“有些事情不对劲，他不诚实。一定会有什么事情不对劲，我现在心里感到非常恐惧。不管怎么说，他想要那艘英国皇家军舰干什么呢？这句话又是什么意思？”她拿出了那封信。“我的心里很不安，这件事肯定会对艾伦不利。打开信，戴维——打开信看看。”","“Davie, take me away from him!” she cried.“There’s something wrong; he’s not true.There will be something wrong; I have a dreadful terror here at my heart.What will he be wanting at all events with that King’s ship?What will this word be saying?”And she held the letter forth.“My mind misgives me, it will be some ill to Alan.Open it, Davie—open it and see.”"
"我拿过信，看着它，然后摇了摇头。","I took it, and looked at it, and shook my head."
"“不，”我说，“这违背我的原则，我不能打开别人的信。”","“No,” said I, “it goes against me, I cannot open a man’s letter.”"
"“不去救你的朋友了？”她叫道。","“Not to save your friend?” she cried."
"“我说不准，”我说，“我不想这么做。要是我真的有把握就好了！”","“I cannae tell,” said I.“I think not.If I was only sure!”"
"“你只需要拆开封签！”她说。","“And you have but to break the seal!” said she."
"“我知道，”我说，“但是这件事违背我的原则。”","“I know it,” said I, “but the thing goes against me.”"
"“就在这里吧，”她说，“我自己来打开这封信。”","“Give it here,” said she, “and I will open it myself.”"
"“你也不能。”我说， “你更不能。这件事牵涉到你父亲，还有他的名誉，亲爱的，虽然我们两个人都对此心怀疑虑。毫无疑问，这个地方显得有点儿危险，那艘英国军舰在这里，你父亲还从那里接到了一封信，还有那个军官也还在岸上。他不会是独自一人的，肯定还有很多人和他一起。我想这一刻就有人在监视着我们。唉，无疑，这封信应该要打开才行。但是不管怎么说，都不该由你或者我来打开。”","“Nor you neither,” said I.“You least of all.It concerns your father, and his honour, dear, which we are both misdoubting.No question but the place is dangerous-like, and the English ship being here, and your father having word from it, and yon officer that stayed ashore.He would not be alone either; there must be more along with him; I daresay we are spied upon this minute.Ay, no doubt, the letter should be opened; but somehow, not by you nor me.”"
"就这样我想了又想，我的头脑中满是一种危险感和对隐藏敌人的担心，这时我看见艾伦了，他在跟踪詹姆斯之后又回来了，现在正一个人在沙丘之间走着。他穿着他的军大衣，当然，很是威风凛凛。但是当我想到那件外衣对他没有好处时，我不由得打了个寒颤。要是他一旦被抓而且被扔到小艇上，再被带上“海马”号战舰，他就会是一个逃亡者，一个叛逆者，他现在就是一个已经被判刑的杀人犯。","I was about thus far with it, and my spirit very much overcome with a sense of danger and hidden enemies, when I spied Alan, come back again from following James and walking by himself among the sand-hills.He was in his soldier’s coat, of course, and mighty fine; but I could not avoid to shudder when I thought how little that jacket would avail him, if he were once caught and flung in a skiff, and carried on board of the Seahorse, a deserter, a rebel, and now a condemned murderer."
"“那里，”我说，“那里有个人才最有权利去打开这封信，或者不打开，只要他认为合适。”","“There,” said I, “there is the man that has the best right to open it: or not, as he thinks fit.”"
"说完，我就大声喊他的名字，而且我们俩都站了起来好让他看到。","With which I called upon his name, and we both stood up to be a mark for him."
"“如果就是如此——如果还更加耻辱——你能够忍受吗？”她问道，目光灼灼地看着我。","“If it is so—if it be more disgrace—will you can bear it?” she asked, looking upon me with a burning eye."
"“我还只见过你一次的时候，你曾问过我一个同样的问题。”我说，“你认为我是怎么回答的呢？如果我正如我想的那样喜欢你——哦，但是我喜欢你更甚！我会在他的绞架下和你结婚。”","“I was asked something of the same question when I had seen you but the once,” said I.“What do you think I answered?That if I liked you as I thought I did—and O, but I like you better!—I would marry you at his gallows’ foot.”"
"血涌上她的脸，她紧紧扑过来靠在我身上，握住我的手，于是我们就这样等待着艾伦。","The blood rose in her face; she came close up and pressed upon me, holding my hand: and it was so that we awaited Alan."
"他带着一种古怪的微笑走了过来。“戴维，我怎么告诉你来着？”他说。","He came with one of his queer smiles.“What was I telling ye, David?” says he."
"“万事皆有定时，艾伦。”我说，“但是时间很紧。你怎么这么快？在我们的这位朋友面前，你可以坦率地说出来。”","“There is a time for all things, Alan,” said I, “and this time is serious.How have you sped?You can speak out plain before this friend of ours.”"
"“我做了一件蠢事。”他说。","“I have been upon a fool’s errand,” said he."
"“那么，我怀疑我们不比你做得好。”我说，“总之，这里有件大事需要你来定夺。你看见这个了吗？”我指着那艘军舰继续说道，“那就是‘海马’号，舰长是帕利泽。”","“I doubt we have done better than you, then,” said I; “and, at least, here is a great deal of matter that you must judge of.Do you see that?”I went on, pointing to the ship.“That is the Seahorse, Captain Palliser.”"
"“我应该也看见过这艘军舰。”艾伦说，“这艘战舰停泊在福斯海湾时，我曾经颇为之紧张犯愁。但是帕利泽靠得这么近是怎么回事？”","“I should ken her, too,” says Alan.“I had fyke enough with her when she was stationed in the Forth.But what ails the man to come so close?”"
"“我先告诉你他为什么来这里吧。”我说，“是为了给詹姆斯·莫尔送这封信。为什么他送完信后就留在这里了，到底可能和什么事情有关，为什么那个军官要藏匿在这荒野里，是否有可能他只是独自一人——我宁愿你多为自己考虑考虑。”","“I will tell you why he came there first,” said I.“It was to bring this letter to James More.Why he stops here now that it’s delivered, what it’s likely to be about, why there’s an officer hiding in the bents, and whether or not it’s probable that he’s alone—I would rather you considered for yourself.”"
"“一封给詹姆斯·莫尔的信？”他说。","“A letter to James More?” said he."
"“正是。”我说。","“The same,” said I."
"“好，我还可以告诉你更多的情况。”艾伦说，“昨天晚上在你熟睡之后，我听到那个人跟一个说法语的人在密谈，然后小客栈的门打开跟着又关上了。”","“Well, and I can tell ye more than that,” said Alan.“For the last night, when you were fast asleep, I heard the man colloguing with some one in the French, and then the door of that inn to be opened and shut.”"
"“艾伦，”我叫道，“你整晚上都在睡觉，我在这里可以证明的。”","“Alan!” cried I, “you slept all night, and I am here to prove it.”"
"“哎呀，但是我永远不相信艾伦，不论他是睡着的还是醒着的！”他说，“但是看样子情况不妙。让我们来看看那封信吧。”","“Ay, but I would never trust Alan whether he was asleep or waking!” says he.“But the business looks bad.Let’s see the letter.”"
"我把信给了他。","I gave it him."
"“卡特里奥娜，”他说，“你得原谅我，亲爱的。我的身家性命可全都押在是否传递这封信上了，我不得不拆开这个封签。”","“Catriona,” said he, “you have to excuse me, my dear; but there’s nothing less than my fine bones upon the cast of it, and I’ll have to break this seal.”"
"“这正是我希望的。”卡特里奥娜说。","“It is my wish,” said Catriona."
"他打开信，粗粗浏览了一遍，然后猛然在空中挥了挥手。","He opened it, glanced it through, and flung his hand in the air."
"“这个可恶的卑鄙小人！”他说，然后把那张信纸塞进他的口袋，“走，我们一起去拿东西。这个地方会是我的葬身之地。”然后他开始向客栈走去。","“The stinking brock!” says he, and crammed the paper in his pocket.“Here, let’s get our things together.This place is fair death to me.”And he began to walk towards the inn."
"还是卡特里奥娜先开口说话了。“他把你给出卖了？”她问。","It was Catriona that spoke the first.“He has sold you?” she asked."
"“是的，亲爱的，”艾伦说，“不过多亏了你和戴维，我还来得及赶紧逃离他。就让我靠我的马来赢吧。”他补充道。","“Sold me, my dear,” said Alan.“But thanks to you and Davie, I’ll can jink him yet.Just let me win upon my horse,” he added."
"“卡特里奥娜必须和我们一起走，”我说，“她可以不再和那个人来往。我和她就要结婚了。”听见此话，她把我的手紧握在她的身边。","“Catriona must come with us,” said I.“She can have no more traffic with that man.She and I are to be married.”At which she pressed my hand to her side."
"“你们是刚才决定要结婚的吗？”艾伦一边向后看一边说道，“这是你们两人做过的最好的一件事！我不得不说，我亲爱的，你们是真正美满的一对。”","“Are ye there with it?” says Alan, looking back.“The best day’s work that ever either of you did yet!And I’m bound to say, my dawtie, ye make a real, bonny couple.”"
"他沿那条路把我们带到紧靠风车的附近，在那里我注意到有一个穿海员裤子的人在风车后面偷窥着我们。只是，当然，我们看到了他的背影而已。","The way that he was following brought us close in by the windmill, where I was aware of a man in seaman’s trousers, who seemed to be spying from behind it.Only, of course, we took him in the rear."
"“艾伦，你看！”","“See, Alan!”"
"“干嘛呢！”他说，“这是我的事情。”","“Wheesht!” said, he, “this is my affairs.”"
"毫无疑问，那个人因为风车的哗哗声不太听得到声音，所以在他注意到我们之前，我们就起身靠近了他。跟着他转过身来，我们发现他是个红褐色面庞的彪形大汉。","The man was, no doubt, a little deafened by the clattering of the mill, and we got up close before he noticed.Then he turned, and we saw he was a big fellow with a mahogany face."
"“我想，先生，”艾伦说，“你会说英语吧？”","“I think, sir,” says Alan, “that you speak the English?”"
"“不，先生。”他说，其法语口音糟糕透了。","“Non, monsieur,” says he, with an incredible bad accent."
"“不，先生。”艾伦模仿他的腔调叫道，“他们在‘海马’号上面就是那样教你法语的吗？你这个傻瓜、大笨蛋，现在就让我这个苏格兰人用靴子狠踹你这个英格兰人的屁股一脚吧！”","“Non, monsieur,” cries Alan, mocking him.“Is that how they learn you French on the Seahorse?Ye muckle, gutsey hash, here’s a Scots boot to your English hurdies!”"
"那个人还来不及逃跑，艾伦就跳起来向他扑过去，他一脚把那个人踹了个狗啃泥。然后他站起身，面带凶狠的笑容，看着那个人爬起身来，撒腿跑进沙丘里了。","And bounding on him before he could escape, he dealt the man a kick that laid him on his nose.Then he stood, with a savage smile, and watched him scramble to his feet and scamper off into the sand-hills."
"“不过现在正是我甩开这些草包的时候了！”艾伦说，然后用最快的速度继续赶路，我们仍然跟着，来到了巴赞客栈的后门。","“But it’s high time I was clear of these empty bents!” said Alan; and continued his way at top speed, and we still following, to the backdoor of Bazin’s inn."
"我们进门时碰巧面对面遇见了詹姆斯·莫尔，他正好从另一扇门进来。","It chanced that as we entered by the one door we came face to face with James More entering by the other."
"“这边！”我对卡特里奥娜说，“快！你上楼去收拾行李。这种场面不适合你。”","“Here!” said I to Catriona, “quick! upstairs with you and make your packets; this is no fit scene for you.”"
"这时詹姆斯和艾伦在这个长房间的正中碰面了。她紧挨着他们身旁走过，到楼梯处。我看到她往上走了几步又回头看了他们一眼，不过没有停步。事实上，他们是值得看一看的。他们相见时，艾伦摆出一副最谦恭友好的样子，但是却带有浓厚的挑衅意味，所以詹姆斯嗅出了这个人有危险，就像嗅出房子里有烟一样，于是他就做好准备应对突然攻击。","In the meanwhile James and Alan had met in the midst of the long room.She passed them close by to reach the stairs; and after she was some way up I saw her turn and glance at them again, though without pausing.Indeed, they were worth looking at.Alan wore as they met one of his best appearances of courtesy and friendliness, yet with something eminently warlike, so that James smelled danger off the man, as folk smell fire in a house, and stood prepared for accidents."
"时间紧迫。艾伦的处境孤立无援，而他的敌人就在周围，这也许都可以把恺撒给吓倒了。艾伦没有因此而有任何改变，他还是带着那种惯有的嘲讽、开玩笑的架势开始了面谈。","Time pressed.Alan’s situation in that solitary place, and his enemies about him, might have daunted Caesar.It made no change in him; and it was in his old spirit of mockery and daffing that he began the interview."
"“对你来说又是美好的一天，德拉蒙德先生。”他说，“你那边在忙的是什么生意？”","“A braw good day to ye again, Mr. Drummond,” said he.“What’ll yon business of yours be just about?”"
"“嗨，这是私事，说来话长。”詹姆斯说，“我想最好等到我们吃饭的时候再说吧。”","“Why, the thing being private, and rather of a long story,” says James, “I think it will keep very well till we have eaten.”"
"“我可没那么肯定。”艾伦说，“我心里想着要么现在就谈，要么永远不谈。因为事实上我和鲍尔弗先生得到了一点儿信息，所以我们正在考虑出路。”","“I’m none so sure of that,” said Alan.“It sticks in my mind it’s either now or never; for the fact is me and Mr. Balfour here have gotten a line, and we’re thinking of the road.”"
"我看见詹姆斯的眼睛里有点儿惊讶，但他牢牢克制住了自己。","I saw a little surprise in James’s eye; but he held himself stoutly."
"“要让你重新心平气和，我只有一句话要说，”他说，“那就是我所做的生意的名目。”","“I have but the one word to say to cure you of that,” said he, “and that is the name of my business.”"
"“那就说说看，”艾伦说，“哈！是谁在打戴维的主意？”","“Say it then,” says Alan.“Hout! wha minds for Davie?”"
"“这件事情可以让我们两个人都成为富翁。”詹姆斯说。","“It is a matter that would make us both rich men,” said James."
"“你告诉我的就是那件事？”艾伦叫道。","“Do you tell me that?” cries Alan."
"“是啊，先生，”詹姆斯说，“事实明摆着，就是克卢尼的宝藏。”","“I do, sir,” said James.“The plain fact is that it is Cluny’s Treasure.”"
"“不！”艾伦叫道，“你听说过那件事？”","“No!” cried Alan.“Have ye got word of it?”"
"“我知道那个地方，斯图尔特先生，而且还可以带你去那里。”詹姆斯说。","“I ken the place, Mr. Stewart, and can take you there,” said James."
"“这真是再好不过了！”艾伦说，“好吧，我很高兴来到敦刻尔克。如此说来，这就是你的交易，是吗？我在想，对半分？”","“This crowns all!” says Alan.“Well, and I’m glad I came to Dunkirk.And so this was your business, was it?Halvers, I’m thinking?”"
"“就是这桩交易，先生。”詹姆斯说。","“That is the business, sir,” said James."
"“好，好，”艾伦说道，然后用同样的孩子般好奇的语调说，“那么，这件事情和‘海马’号无关？”他问。","“Well, well,” said Alan; and then in the same tone of childlike interest, “it has naething to do with the Seahorse, then?” he asked,"
"“和什么？”詹姆斯说。","“With what?” says James."
"“或者说，和刚才我在那边的风车后面对他屁股踹了一脚的那个家伙无关？”艾伦追问道，“嘿，伙计！是和你这个人渣有关啊！我口袋里还揣着帕利泽的信呢。詹姆斯·莫尔，你和这事有关联。你永远都别想再到正派人面前露脸了。”","“Or the lad that I have just kicked the bottom of behind yon windmill?” pursued Alan.“Hut, man! have done with your lees!I have Palliser’s letter here in my pouch.You’re by with it, James More.You can never show your face again with dacent folk.”"
"詹姆斯闻听此言大吃一惊。他僵立了一阵，一动不动而且脸色煞白，然后他一股怒火升了起来。","James was taken all aback with it.He stood a second, motionless and white, then swelled with the living anger."
"“你这个杂种，你是在对我说话吗？”他咆哮道。","“Do you talk to me, you bastard?” he roared out."
"“你这个下贱的畜生！”艾伦叫道，然后对着他一顿破口大骂，接下来刹那间他们就刀剑相接了。","“Ye glee’d swine!” cried Alan, and hit him a sounding buffet on the mouth, and the next wink of time their blades clashed together."
"听到第一声钢剑撞击声，我本能地从冲突中往后一跃。接下来我看见，詹姆斯惊险地避开一剑，我都以为他被刺死了。我心底升起一种想法，这是那个女孩的父亲，在某种意义上几乎可以说就是我自己的父亲，于是我拔剑跑过去想把他们分开。","At the first sound of the bare steel I instinctively leaped back from the collision.The next I saw, James parried a thrust so nearly that I thought him killed; and it lowed up in my mind that this was the girl’s father, and in a manner almost my own, and I drew and ran in to sever them."
"“退后，戴维！你疯了！你这该死的家伙，退后！”艾伦吼叫道，“你自己会脑袋开花的！”","“Keep back, Davie!Are ye daft!Damn ye, keep back!” roared Alan.“Your blood be on your ain heid then!”"
"我把他们的剑锋压下了两次。我被撞在墙上，一阵晕眩，然后再次跳回到他们中间。他们没有注意我，两个人都狂怒地互相对刺着。我永远也想不到自己是怎么避免被刺到的，或者怎么避免刺伤这两个死敌中的任何一个的。整件事情对我就像是一段梦境，期间我听见楼梯上传来一声大叫，接着卡特里奥娜就闪现在她父亲的前面。就在此时，我的剑尖碰到了什么东西，变弯了。我抽回剑时，剑已经染红。我看见鲜血在女孩的方巾上涌出，我站在那里，心里很难受。","I beat their blades down twice.I was knocked reeling against the wall; I was back again betwixt them.They took no heed of me, thrusting at each other like two furies.I can never think how I avoided being stabbed myself or stabbing one of these two Rodomonts, and the whole business turned about me like a piece of a dream; in the midst of which I heard a great cry from the stair, and Catriona sprang before her father.In the same moment the point of my sword encountered some thing yielding.It came back to me reddened.I saw the blood flow on the girl’s kerchief, and stood sick."
"“你是要在我眼前杀了他吗？干脆连他的女儿我也一并杀了吧！”她叫道。","“Will you be killing him before my eyes, and me his daughter after all!” she cried."
"“亲爱的，是我在跟他斗。”艾伦说，然后走过去，坐在桌旁。他双臂交叉，那柄未入鞘的剑还握在手里。","“My dear, I have done with him,” said Alan, and went, and sat on a table, with his arms crossed and the sword naked in his hand."
"她在詹姆斯面前站了一会儿，喘着气，睁着大大的眼睛，然后突然转身面对着他。","Awhile she stood before the man, panting, with big eyes, then swung suddenly about and faced him."
"“滚！”她这么说道，“带着你的耻辱滚出我的视线，让我和清白的人呆在一起。我是阿尔平的女儿！你这阿尔平子孙的耻辱，滚！”","“Begone!” was her word, “take your shame out of my sight; leave me with clean folk.I am a daughter of Alpin!Shame of the sons of Alpin, begone!”"
"这番话说得充满激情，让我从自己剑上沾染血迹的恐惧中清醒了过来。他们俩面对面站着，她的方巾上染有红色的血迹，而他的脸色则苍白得像块破布。我太了解他了——我知道这番话一定刺穿了他内心的敏感之处，但是他还在竭力地虚张声势。","It was said with so much passion as awoke me from the horror of my own bloodied sword.The two stood facing, she with the red stain on her kerchief, he white as a rag.I knew him well enough—I knew it must have pierced him in the quick place of his soul; but he betook himself to a bravado air."
"“怎么，”他一边把剑收入鞘中一边说着，但是他发光的眼睛仍然在盯着艾伦，“如果这场恶斗已经结束了，那我就去拿我的旅行箱——”","“Why,” says he, sheathing his sword, though still with a bright eye on Alan, “if this brawl is over I will but get my portmanteau—”"
"“不许从这个地方拿旅行箱出去，除非我同意。”艾伦说。","“There goes no pockmantie out of this place except with me,” says Alan."
"“先生！”詹姆斯叫道。","“Sir!” cries James."
"“詹姆斯·莫尔，”艾伦说，“这位女士，你的女儿，将要嫁给我的朋友戴维，看在这个份上，我就让你全身而退。但是你要听我的忠告，不要再参与作恶，否则悔之晚矣。你恐怕想不到，我的好脾气可是有限度的。”","“James More,” says Alan, “this lady daughter of yours is to marry my friend Davie, upon the which account I let you pack with a hale carcase.But take you my advice of it and get that carcase out of harm’s way or ower late.Little as you suppose it, there are leemits to my temper.”"
"“该死，先生，可是我的钱还在那里！”詹姆斯说。","“Be damned, sir, but my money’s there!” said James."
"“我也在为此烦心呢，”艾伦说，一副滑稽的表情，“但是现在，你要明白，那都是我的了。”随后他更加严肃地说：“我忠告你，詹姆斯·莫尔，你给我离开这栋房子。”","“I’m vexed about that, too,” says Alan, with his funny face, “but now, ye see, it’s mines.”And then with more gravity, “Be you advised, James More, you leave this house.”"
"詹姆斯似乎在心里盘算了一会儿，不过他应该是想到已经领教够艾伦的剑术了，因为他突然对着我们脱下帽子（一副倒霉透顶的脸色）向我们依次道别了。随后他就走了。","James seemed to cast about for a moment in his mind; but it’s to be thought he had enough of Alan’s swordsmanship, for he suddenly put off his hat to us and (with a face like one of the damned) bade us farewell in a series.With which he was gone."
"与此同时，我就像被解开了魔咒。","At the same time a spell was lifted from me."
"“卡特里奥娜，”我叫道，“那是我——是我的剑。哦，你伤得重吗？”","“Catriona,” I cried, “it was me—it was my sword.O, are you much hurt?”"
"“我知道，戴维，我虽然疼，却爱着你。你只不过是为了防卫那个坏人，我的父亲。看！”她说，并且让我看流血的剑伤，“要知道，现在你已经让我成为大丈夫了。我将像一位老兵那样身带剑伤了。”","“I know it, Davie, I am loving you for the pain of it; it was done defending that bad man, my father.See!” she said, and showed me a bleeding scratch, “see, you have made a man of me now.I will carry a wound like an old soldier.”"
"我为她受的伤很轻而感到欣慰，而对她勇敢天性的爱恋也激励了我。我拥住她，亲吻那处伤口。","Joy that she should be so little hurt, and the love of her brave nature, supported me.I embraced her, I kissed the wound."
"“我就不可以吻一吻吗？我可是从不失去任何机会的。”艾伦说，随即把我推到一边，并抓住卡特里奥娜的一边肩膀，“亲爱的，”他说，“你是阿平家族真正的女儿。众所周知，他是一个了不起的男子汉，不过他也会为你而感到非常自豪的。如果将来我要结婚的话，我为我的子女寻找的母亲也一定是你这样的人。我以国王的名义发誓，我说的是真心话。”","“And am I to be out of the kissing, me that never lost a chance?” says Alan; and putting me aside and taking Catriona by either shoulder, “My dear,” he said, “you’re a true daughter of Alpin.By all accounts, he was a very fine man, and he may weel be proud of you.If ever I was to get married, it’s the marrow of you I would be seeking for a mother to my sons.And I bear’s a king’s name and speak the truth.”"
"他带着非常热烈而又钦慕的口吻说了这番话，让她感到很甜蜜，而且通过她又把甜蜜传给了我。这似乎彻底擦净了詹姆斯·莫尔给我们带来的一切耻辱。接下来他又恢复了原样。","He said it with a serious heat of admiration that was honey to the girl, and through her, to me.It seemed to wipe us clean of all James More’s disgraces.And the next moment he was just himself again."
"“可是现在对不起，我亲爱的，”他说，“这次干得是很漂亮，但是艾伦·布雷克这个可怜的家伙，比起他一直在担心的，离绞架就更近一些了。天哪！我觉得从这个地方离开还真不错。”","“And now by your leave, my dawties,” said he, “this is a’ very bonny; but Alan Breck’ll be a wee thing nearer to the gallows than he’s caring for; and Dod!I think this is a grand place to be leaving.”"
"这句话让我们恢复了一点儿理智。 艾伦跑上楼，然后拿来了我们的鞍包和詹姆斯·莫尔的旅行箱，而我则捡起了卡特里奥娜先前掉在楼梯上的小包。接着我们就动身离开了那座危机重重的房子。这时巴赞一边叫喊一边打着手势拦住了我们的去路。在我们拔剑相斗时他急忙躲到桌子底下去了，但是现在他却勇猛得如狮子一般。原来他是要我们付账。有一张椅子给摔坏了，艾伦就坐在他的餐桌旁边，而詹姆斯·莫尔已经跑了。","The word recalled us to some wisdom.Alan ran upstairs and returned with our saddle-bags and James More’s portmanteau; I picked up Catriona’s bundle where she had dropped it on the stair; and we were setting forth out of that dangerous house, when Bazin stopped the way with cries and gesticulations.He had whipped under a table when the swords were drawn, but now he was as bold as a lion.There was his bill to be settled, there was a chair broken, Alan had sat among his dinner things, James More had fled."
"“给你，”我叫道，“你自己算算吧。”跟着我扔给他几个路易，因为我觉得没有时间去算账了。","“Here,” I cried, “pay yourself,” and flung him down some Lewie d’ors; for I thought it was no time to be accounting."
"他扑向那些钱，我们从他身边经过，跑向前面的开阔地。那座房子的三面都有海员在匆匆忙忙地包抄过来。靠我们更近一点儿的地方，詹姆斯·莫尔挥舞着他的帽子好像在催促他们。在他身后就是风车旋转的风叶，像是一个傻瓜在高高地举着手。","He sprang upon that money, and we passed him by, and ran forth into the open.Upon three sides of the house were seamen hasting and closing in; a little nearer to us James More waved his hat as if to hurry them; and right behind him, like some foolish person holding up his hands, were the sails of the windmill turning."
"艾伦只瞥了一眼，然后就躬下身子跑起来。他提的詹姆斯·莫尔的旅行箱很有分量，不过我觉得他宁可丢了性命也不愿意丢掉他复仇的战利品。他这一跑，我也只好跟着他跑，看到那个女孩能紧跟在我身边，让我感到惊奇和狂喜。","Alan gave but one glance, and laid himself down to run.He carried a great weight in James More’s portmanteau; but I think he would as soon have lost his life as cast away that booty which was his revenge; and he ran so that I was distressed to follow him, and marvelled and exulted to see the girl bounding at my side."
"我们一出现，他们那一方就抛弃了一切伪装。那些船员大声叫喊，互相招呼着追赶我们。开始我们领先了大约两百码，但是毕竟他们都穿着篷布靴，双腿向外弯曲，在这种行动中就不可能指望比我们灵敏了。我认为他们都有武器，不过在法国的土地上他们不敢使用手枪。当我发觉我们不仅占有领先优势，而且距离还拉开了一些之后，马上就觉得形势没有那么紧张了。总体来说，只要当时的情势持续下去，就会惊险而紧张。敦刻尔克仍然很远，当我们猛然冲上那个小山丘时，才发现山丘另一边有一个连的守军在演习行军，我终于能真正理解艾伦说的话了。","As soon as we appeared, they cast off all disguise upon the other side; and the seamen pursued us with shouts and view-hullohs.We had a start of some two hundred yards, and they were but bandy-legged tarpaulins after all, that could not hope to better us at such an exercise.I suppose they were armed, but did not care to use their pistols on French ground.And as soon as I perceived that we not only held our advantage but drew a little away, I began to feel quite easy of the issue.For all which, it was a hot, brisk bit of work, so long as it lasted; Dunkirk was still far off; and when we popped over a knowe, and found a company of the garrison marching on the other side on some manoeuvre, I could very well understand the word that Alan had."
"他立刻停止奔跑，擦拭着额头说：“他们真的很强，那些法国人。”","He stopped running at once; and mopping at his brow, “They’re a real bonny folk, the French nation,” says he."
"尾声","CONCLUSION"
"一安全进入敦刻尔克的城墙内，我们马上就当前的处境举行了一个很有必要的战时会议。我们是通过武力威逼把一位女儿从其父亲身边带走的，任何法官都会要求立刻把她送还给他，而且还极有可能把我和艾伦关进监狱。尽管在帕利泽舰长的信中有对我们有利的证据，但是我和卡特里奥娜都不愿意将其公诸于众。考虑到各个方面，似乎最稳妥的办法就是带这位女孩去巴黎，把她交给她自己的族长，波哈尔狄的麦格雷戈，他会很乐意帮助他这位女亲戚。另一方面，根本就不用急着让詹姆斯在其他人面前丢脸。","No sooner were we safe within the walls of Dunkirk than we held a very necessary council-of-war on our position.We had taken a daughter from her father at the sword’s point; any judge would give her back to him at once, and by all likelihood clap me and Alan into jail; and though we had an argument upon our side in Captain Palliser’s letter, neither Catriona nor I were very keen to be using it in public.Upon all accounts it seemed the most prudent to carry the girl to Paris to the hands of her own chieftain, Macgregor of Bohaldie, who would be very willing to help his kinswoman, on the one hand, and not at all anxious to dishonour James upon other."
"只是我们的行程很缓慢，因为卡特里奥娜虽然善于奔跑，但是骑马却不行，自从1745年以后她就很少再登上马鞍了。但我们最终还是在安息日的清早成功抵达了巴黎。随后由艾伦引路，我们赶紧去找波哈尔狄。他的住宅很不错，生活也优裕，因为除了苏格兰基金提供的养老金，他还有个人的收益。他像对自家人一样招呼卡特里奥娜，显得很礼貌，言语谨慎，但不是特别坦诚。我们打听詹姆斯·莫尔的消息。“可怜的詹姆斯！”他说完之后摇摇头笑了，因此我认为他知道的远比告诉我们的多。然后，我们给他看了帕利泽的信，他看了之后脸拉得很长。","We made but a slow journey of it up, for Catriona was not so good at the riding as the running, and had scarce sat in the saddle since the ‘Forty-five.But we made it out at last, reached Paris early of a Sabbath morning, and made all speed, under Alan’s guidance, to find Bohaldie.He was finely lodged, and lived in a good style, having a pension on the Scots Fund, as well as private means; greeted Catriona like one of his own house, and seemed altogether very civil and discreet, but not particularly open.We asked of the news of James More.“Poor James!” said he, and shook his head and smiled, so that I thought he knew further than he meant to tell.Then we showed him Palliser’s letter, and he drew a long face at that."
"“可怜的詹姆斯！”他又说道，“唉，当然还有人比詹姆斯·莫尔更坏。但是这个家伙真是坏到家了。啧，啧，他肯定完全忘记自己是谁了！这是一封最令人不快的信。 但是，尽管如此，先生们，我还是看不出我们有什么必要公开这封信。家丑不可外扬，我们都是苏格兰人，也都是高地人。”","“Poor James!” said he again.“Well, there are worse folk than James More, too.But this is dreadful bad.Tut, tut, he must have forgot himself entirely!This is a most undesirable letter.But, for all that, gentlemen, I cannot see what we would want to make it public for.It’s an ill bird that fouls his own nest, and we are all Scots folk and all Hieland.”"
"对此我们都表示赞同，也许艾伦除外。接着更多谈的是关于我们的婚姻大事了，婚事是由波哈尔狄亲自操办的，就好像根本没有詹姆斯·莫尔这个人一样。他非常合乎礼节地把卡特里奥娜交给了新郎，他用法语说的赞美之词也很恰当得体。仪式还没有完全结束，我们酒兴正浓时，他告诉我们詹姆斯就在这座城市里，比我们早几天到这里，他现在生病了，好像快要死了。我觉得从我妻子的脸上我就看出她想要做什么了。","Upon this we all agreed, save perhaps Alan; and still more upon the question of our marriage, which Bohaldie took in his own hands, as though there had been no such person as James More, and gave Catriona away with very pretty manners and agreeable compliments in French.It was not till all was over, and our healths drunk, that he told us James was in that city, whither he had preceded us some days, and where he now lay sick, and like to die.I thought I saw by my wife’s face what way her inclination pointed."
"“那我们就去看看他吧。”我说。","“And let us go see him, then,” said I."
"“如果你愿意的话。”卡特里奥娜说。这已经是早些天的事了。","“If it is your pleasure,” said Catriona.These were early days."
"他就在这座城市，和他的族长住在同一个居民区，就在拐角处的一所大房子里。苏格兰风笛声引着我们向上爬到了他睡觉的阁楼。看样子他才从波哈尔狄那里借来这套风笛，以便养病时消遣。虽然他的技艺不如他的兄弟罗布，但是他也很擅长演奏那种音乐。真的很奇怪，居然有很多法国人挤在楼梯口，其中有些人还在笑。他倚靠在草垫床上。第一眼看见他，我就看出他已经时日无多。无疑，他会客死异乡了。但是就算这个时候，我发现我都几乎没有耐心去多想他的结局。无疑，波哈尔狄已经让他提前有了心理准备。他好像知道我们已经结婚了，还为此向我们表示了祝贺，并像家长一样给予我们祝福。","He was lodged in the same quarter of the city with his chief, in a great house upon a corner; and we were guided up to the garret where he lay by the sound of Highland piping.It seemed he had just borrowed a set of them from Bohaldie to amuse his sickness; though he was no such hand as was his brother Rob, he made good music of the kind; and it was strange to observe the French folk crowding on the stairs, and some of them laughing.He lay propped in a pallet.The first look of him I saw he was upon his last business; and, doubtless, this was a strange place for him to die in.But even now I find I can scarce dwell upon his end with patience.Doubtless, Bohaldie had prepared him; he seemed to know we were married, complimented us on the event, and gave us a benediction like a patriarch."
"“从来就没有人理解我，”他说，“我没有多加思索就原谅你们两个人了。”说完之后他又像原来那样满世界地扯开了。他非常开心地用风笛为我们演奏了一两首曲子，而且在我们离开前还向我借了一小笔钱。","“I have been never understood,” said he.“I forgive you both without an afterthought;” after which he spoke for all the world in his old manner, was so obliging as to play us a tune or two upon his pipes, and borrowed a small sum before I left."
"我从他的任何行为举止中都看不出哪怕一丝羞愧。不过他倒挺会原谅别人的，他似乎不断地在原谅别人。我觉得每一次我们见面他都原谅了我。大约过了四天，他带着挚爱圣洁的声誉去世了。我气愤得直扯自己的头发。我安葬了他，但是我真不知道该在他的墓碑上写什么，最终我认为最好只刻上他的生卒日期。","I could not trace even a hint of shame in any part of his behaviour; but he was great upon forgiveness; it seemed always fresh to him.I think he forgave me every time we met; and when after some four days he passed away in a kind of odour of affectionate sanctity, I could have torn my hair out for exasperation.I had him buried; but what to put upon his tomb was quite beyond me, till at last I considered the date would look best alone."
"我认为打消去莱登的想法更加明智，我们曾在那里作为兄妹出现过，如果以新的角色回去看起来肯定很奇怪。苏格兰很适合我们。在苏格兰，我找回了曾留在那里的一切，之后我们就乘坐一艘低地的船起航了。","I thought it wiser to resign all thoughts of Leyden, where we had appeared once as brother and sister, and it would certainly look strange to return in a new character.Scotland would be doing for us; and thither, after I had recovered that which I had left behind, we sailed in a Low Country ship."
"现在，芭芭拉·鲍尔弗小姐（要设定女士优先），还有肖斯的小艾伦·鲍尔弗先生，故事到这里就要讲完了。你们会发现（只要你们好好想一想），这个故事中出现的很多人物，你们都看见过，而且还和他们说过话呢。莱姆基恩斯的艾莉森·黑斯蒂就是那个给你们摇摇篮的少女，只是你们当时太小不记得了，你们长大一点儿后，她还曾带你们去户外到庭院里散步来着。那位非常优雅的贵妇人就是给芭芭拉小姐命名的教母，她正是那位在检察总长大人家里经常愚弄戴维·鲍尔弗的格兰特小姐。我在想你们是否还记得一位戴着假发、穿着大衣，个子瘦小而活泼的绅士，那个在漆黑的深夜来到肖斯大屋，唤醒你们起床，还带你们下楼到餐厅的那个名叫贾米森先生的调皮鬼？或者艾伦是否忘记了他应贾米森先生的要求所做的事——一桩最不忠诚的行径——为此，按照法律条文，他会被绞死——那绝不亚于隔海为国王的健康祝酒。这些都是发生在一个十足的辉格党人家里的怪事。但是贾米森先生是一位有特权的人，甚至都可以放火烧我的谷仓。如今法国的人们只知道他的名字就是斯图尔特骑士。","And now, Miss Barbara Balfour (to set the ladies first), and Mr. Alan Balfour younger of Shaws, here is the story brought fairly to an end.A great many of the folk that took a part in it, you will find (if you think well) that you have seen and spoken with.Alison Hastie in Limekilns was the lass that rocked your cradle when you were too small to know of it, and walked abroad with you in the policy when you were bigger.That very fine great lady that is Miss Barbara’s name-mamma is no other than the same Miss Grant that made so much a fool of David Balfour in the house of the Lord Advocate.And I wonder whether you remember a little, lean, lively gentleman in a scratch-wig and a wraprascal, that came to Shaws very late of a dark night, and whom you were awakened out of your beds and brought down to the dining-hall to be presented to, by the name of Mr. Jamieson?Or has Alan forgotten what he did at Mr. Jamieson’s request—a most disloyal act—for which, by the letter of the law, he might be hanged—no less than drinking the king’s health across the water?These were strange doings in a good Whig house!But Mr. Jamieson is a man privileged, and might set fire to my corn-barn; and the name they know him by now in France is the Chevalier Stewart."
"至于说戴维和卡特里奥娜，在今后的岁月里，我会非常仔细地观察，看看你们是否那么大胆居然嘲笑爸爸和妈妈。我们真的并没有我们想象的那样明智，所以平白生出了很多伤感。但是你们长大后就会发现即使是机灵的芭芭拉小姐，即使是勇猛的艾伦先生，也不会比他们的父母聪明很多。因为在我们这个世界上人们的生活就是一件很好笑的事情。他们谈论着哭泣的天使，但是我觉得他们看待问题时肯定更多地还是站在自己的立场上了。有一件事情是我开始讲这个长长的故事时就决定了要去做的，那就是把发生的所有事情都说出来。","As for Davie and Catriona, I shall watch you pretty close in the next days, and see if you are so bold as to be laughing at papa and mamma.It is true we were not so wise as we might have been, and made a great deal of sorrow out of nothing; but you will find as you grow up that even the artful Miss Barbara, and even the valiant Mr. Alan, will be not so very much wiser than their parents.For the life of man upon this world of ours is a funny business.They talk of the angels  weeping; but I think they must more often be holding their sides as  they look on; and there was one thing I determined to do when I began  this long story, and that was to tell out everything as it befell."
