"菲尔米亚尼夫人","Madame Firmiani"
"作者：巴尔扎克","by Honore de Balzac"
"许多故事，或情境多变，或因为无数偶然的情节而充满戏剧性，其本身都有自己独特的构思。这些故事可以由讲述者进行艺术加工，也可以由他们不加任何修饰地平铺直叙，都不会让故事主题的魅力削减分毫。但是，也有一些在人类生活中发生的事情，唯有付出真心，才能赋予其生命；有一些细节——或许我们可以称之为细致入微——唯有经过思维同样细致的提炼，才能再现其精妙；有一些画像，要想为之注入灵魂，则必须刻画出其生动面容的最细微的表情，否则便没有任何价值可言；此外还有一些事情，要不是因为有神秘的和谐力量的存在，我们将不知道该怎样去表达或处理。这种种和谐的力量或产生于某一日、某一时，或产生于某些祥瑞天意或内在道德倾向的巧合。","Many tales, either rich in situations or made dramatic by some of the innumerable tricks of chance, carry with them their own particular setting, which can be rendered artistically or simply by those who narrate them, without their subjects losing any, even the least of their charms.But there are some incidents in human experience to which the heart alone is able to give life; there are certain details—shall we call them anatomical?—the delicate touches of which cannot be made to reappear unless by an equally delicate rendering of thought; there are portraits which require the infusion of a soul, and mean nothing unless the subtlest expression of the speaking countenance is given; furthermore, there are things which we know not how to say or do without the aid of secret harmonies which a day, an hour, a fortunate conjunction of celestial signs, or an inward moral tendency may produce."
"我们迫切需要这些神秘的启示，才能讲述这个简单的故事。希望这个故事能够吸引那些天生就多愁善感、于柔情之中获得支持的人。如果一位作家，像一个陪伴在即将离世的朋友身旁的外科医生一样，对于他所论及的主题怀着一颗敬畏之心，那么读者难道不应该去体会这种难以言表的感情吗？这种既模糊又神经质的悲伤把我们周遭都染成了灰色。它其实是一种亚健康状态。它带来的痛苦很温和，甚至时常会让人感到快乐。难道让我们自己对这种悲伤之情感同身受是如此之困难吗？如果读者属于那一类有时会想起失去的至爱亲朋的人；如果天色渐晚或者夜晚已经来临，并且他是独自一人，那就让他继续读这个故事吧。否则，还是马上把书放在一边的好。如果读者从来都没有埋葬过一位上了年纪、体弱、贫穷的亲人，他就不会懂这个故事。这个故事对于有些人，有如馥郁的麝香；而对于另一些人，则如弗洛里安的作品一样冠冕堂皇却索然无味。总之，读者必定曾纵情地哭过；曾因想起逝去的记忆和远离的身影而感到过无言的痛楚——这些记忆会使人们为大地所吞噬的一切感到痛惜，同时微笑着忆起逝去的欢乐。","Such mysterious revelations are imperatively needed in order to tell this simple history, in which we seek to interest those souls that are naturally grave and reflective and find their sustenance in tender emotions.If the writer, like the surgeon beside his dying friend, is filled with a species of reverence for the subject he is handling, should not the reader share in that inexplicable feeling?Is it so difficult to put ourselves in unison with the vague and nervous sadness which casts its gray tints all about us, and is, in fact, a semi-illness, the gentle sufferings of which are often pleasing?If the reader is of those who sometimes think upon the dear ones they have lost, if he is alone, if the day is waning or the night has come, let him read on; otherwise, he should lay aside this book at once.If he has never buried a good old relative, infirm and poor, he will not understand these pages, which to some will seem redolent of musk, to others as colorless and virtuous as those of Florian.In short, the reader must have known the luxury of tears, must have felt the silent pangs of a passing memory, the vision of a dear yet far-off Shade,—memories which bring regret for all that earth has swallowed up, with smiles for vanished joys."
"现在请你相信，即使能得到英国所有的财富，作者也不会窃取任何的诗句来美化这个故事。下面讲的是一个真实的故事。你尽可以付出你珍贵的情感——如果你拥有这种情感的话。","And now, believe that the writer would not, for the wealth of England, steal from poesy a single lie with which to embellish this narrative.The following is a true history, on which you may safely spend the treasures of your sensibility—if you have any."
"近些年，正如法国这个大家庭有各式各样的人一样，法语这门语言也有多种不同的表达方式，体现了不同人物的风格。当听到那些不同类型的巴黎人用不同的方法解释或表达同一个东西或同一事件时，你会觉得非常新奇，也非常有趣——“巴黎人”用在这里只是为了概括我们的观点的。","In these days the French language has as many idioms and represents as many idiosyncracies as there are varieties of men in the great family of France.It is extremely curious and amusing to listen to the different interpretations or versions of the same thing or the same event by the various species which compose the genus Parisian,—“Parisian” is here used merely to generalize our remark."
"因此，如果你对一个生性实际的人说：“你认识菲尔米亚尼夫人吗？”他会通过以下这番描述使你对这位女士有个初步印象：“她有着一栋位于巴克路的豪宅、布置气派的客厅、一些精美的画作、一年十万法郎的收入，和一个曾任蒙特诺特省税务长的丈夫。”说完这些，这个生性实际、又矮又胖、总穿一身黑色衣服的人会翘起下嘴唇，覆盖住上嘴唇，一边还点着头，好像在说：“都是实在人，没什么可说的。”不必多问了，生性实际的人总是通过数字、收入、或者不动产——他们字典里的一个词——来确定每个人的身份。","Therefore, if you should say to an individual of the species Practical, “Do you know Madame Firmiani?” he would present that lady to your mind by the following inventory: “Fine house in the rue du Bac, salons handsomely furnished, good pictures, one hundred thousand francs a year, husband formerly receiver-general of the department of Montenotte.”So saying, the Practical man, rotund and fat and usually dressed in black, will project his lower lip and wrap it over the upper, nodding his head as if to add: “Solid people, those; nothing to be said against them.”Ask no further; Practical men settle everybody’s status by figures, incomes, or solid acres,—a phrase of their lexicon."
"请你转向右边，再向一个游手好闲之徒问相同的问题。“菲尔米亚尼夫人吗？”他说道，“是的，没错，我和她很熟。我常参加她家的聚会，她总在星期三招待朋友；非常棒的房子！”——菲尔米亚尼夫人变成了一栋房子！但是这栋房子并不是建筑意义上一砖一瓦盖起来的，当然不是了。在游手好闲之徒的语言里，这个词表达的是一个难以形容的习语。——眼前这个游手好闲之徒，又干又瘦，面带和蔼的笑容，说着空洞的话语，后天学到的小聪明胜过先天的智慧。他俯身凑到你的耳边，眼中透着一股精明劲，说道：“我从来都没见过菲尔米亚尼先生。他的社会职务是照管在意大利的财产。菲尔米亚尼夫人是个法国女人，像巴黎人一样地大把花钱。她的茶会棒极了。这是为数不多的几个可以让你开心的府邸之一，那里的茶点非常精致。获准参加她的沙龙是很不容易的。因此，在她的沙龙上，碰到的当然都是最顶层社会的人物了。”这时，游手好闲之徒取了一撮鼻烟出来。他慢慢地吸着，好像在说：“我是要去那儿的，但别指望我会介绍你去。”","Turn to the right, and put the same question to that other man, who belongs to the species Lounger.“Madame Firmiani?” he says; “yes, yes, I know her well; I go to her parties; receives Wednesdays; highly creditable house.”—Madame Firmiani is metamorphosed into a house! but the house is not a pile of stones architectually superposed, of course not, the word presents in Lounger’s language an indescribable idiom.—Here the Lounger, a spare man with an agreeable smile, a sayer of pretty nothings with more acquired cleverness than native wit, stoops to your ear and adds, with a shrewd glance: “I have never seen Monsieur Firmiani.His social position is that of looking after property in Italy.Madame Firmiani is a Frenchwoman, and spends her money like a Parisian.She has excellent tea.It is one of the few houses where you can amuse yourself; the refreshments are exquisite.It is very difficult to get admitted; therefore, of course, one meets only the best society in her salons.”Here the Lounger takes a pinch of snuff; he inhales it slowly and seems to say: “I go there, but don’t expect me to present you.”"
"显然，这个游手好闲之徒认为菲尔米亚尼夫人在某种程度上像是个开客栈的，只是没有挂牌子。","Evidently the Lounger considers that Madame Firmiani keeps a sort of inn, without a sign."
"“你为什么想要认识菲尔米亚尼夫人呢？她家的聚会就像宫廷本身一样的乏味。这些沙龙的风尚就是无聊的谈话和愚蠢的短小歌谣。要是不能避开这些沙龙，还要脑子有什么用呢？”你这次问的是一个自大狂类型的人，他们是那种想要把整个世界掌控在自己手中、没有他们的允许，什么事情都不许做的人。他们会因别人的开心而感到难过；他们放任罪恶、衰败和过失，并且只喜欢受保护者。他们本性是贵族，却出于泄恨成了民主主义者。他们宁愿混迹于低等人中，与其为伍。","“Why do you want to know Madame Firmiani?Her parties are as dull as the Court itself.What is the good of possessing a mind unless to avoid such salons, where stupid talk and foolish little ballads are the order of the day.”You have questioned a being classed Egotist, a species who would like to keep the universe under lock and key, and let nothing be done without their permission.They are unhappy if others are happy; they forgive nothing but vices, downfalls, frailties, and like none but proteges.Aristocrats by inclination, they make themselves democrats out of spite, preferring to consort with inferiors as equals."
"“噢，菲尔米亚尼夫人，我亲爱的朋友！她是那些可爱的女性中的一个。通过这些可爱的女性，大自然祈求人们原谅她所创造的那些丑陋的人们。菲尔米亚尼夫人迷人且心地善良！我希望我拥有权力和百万财富，使我可以——”（接着便是耳语了）。“需要我为你引荐吗？”说话的是个学生类型的年轻人，因为在男人面前敢作敢为，在女人面前胆小羞怯而出名。","“Oh, Madame Firmiani, my dear fellow! she is one of those adorable women who serve as Nature’s excuse for all the ugly ones she creates.Madame Firmiani is enchanting, and so kind!I wish I were in power and possessed millions that I might—” (here a whisper).“Shall I present you?”The speaker is a youth of the Student species, known for his boldness among men and his timidity in a boudoir."
"“菲尔米亚尼夫人？”另一个人喊道，一边还舞动着他的手杖，“我来说说我对她的看法：她是一个介于三十到三十五岁之间的女人，肤色暗淡、双眼秀美、身材扁平、嗓音低哑、衣着考究、涂脂抹粉且举止迷人。总之，我亲爱的朋友，她是一个风韵犹存、仍值得为其付出感情的女人。”这番话出自纨绔子弟一类型的人之口，此人刚吃过早饭，并没认真考虑自己说的话，马上准备去骑马了。就在这种时候，纨绔子弟们都是冷酷无情的。","“Madame Firmiani?” cries another, twirling his cane.“I’ll tell you what I think of her; she is a woman between thirty and thirty-five; faded complexion, handsome eyes, flat figure, contralto voice worn out, much dressed, rather rouged, charming manners; in short, my dear fellow, the remains of a pretty woman who is still worth the trouble of a passion.”This remark is from the species Fop, who has just breakfasted, doesn’t weigh his words, and is about to mount his horse.At that particular moment Fops are pitiless."
"“她家所收藏的画作精美绝伦，无论如何也要去看一看。”另一个人答道，“再没什么能比这些画作更精美的了。”这是一个艺术品鉴赏家的回答。他离开你之后就要去佩里尼翁或特里佩那里了。对于他而言，菲尔米亚尼夫人就是一幅幅收藏的油画。","“Magnificent collection of pictures in her house; go and see them by all means,” answers another.“Nothing finer.”You have questioned one of the species Connoisseur.He leaves you to go to Perignon’s or Tripet’s.To him, Madame Firmiani is a collection of painted canvases."
"一个女人说道：“菲尔米亚尼夫人？我可不希望你去见她。”这句话含义可丰富了。菲尔米亚尼夫人！一个危险的女人！一个妖妇！她穿着考究、有品位，让别的女人都难以入睡。","A Woman: “Madame Firmiani?I don’t wish you to visit her.”This remark is rich in meanings.Madame Firmiani! a dangerouse woman! a siren! dresses well, has taste; gives other women sleepless nights."
"说这话的属于那种不怀好意的人。","Your informant belongs to the genus Spiteful."
"一个使馆随员说道：“菲尔米亚尼夫人？她不是安特卫普人吗？我十年前在罗马见过她，那时候她美极了。”使馆随员类型的人都热衷于模仿塔列朗的风格讲话。他们措辞如此巧妙，以至于人们不知其所云。他们就像桌球选手一样，用尽高超的技艺，只是为了不击中球。这些人大多沉默寡言。就算开口，也只是谈论西班牙、维也纳、意大利或者彼得堡。各个国家的名称在他们脑海里有如弹簧一样，你一按，各种不同的声音便响起来了。","An Attache to an embassy: “Madame Firmiani?Isn’t she from Antwerp?I saw her ten years ago in Rome; she was very handsome then.”Individuals of the species Attache have a mania for talking in the style of Talleyrand.Their wit is often so refined that the point is imperceptible; they are like billiard-players who avoid hitting the ball with consummate dexterity.These individuals are usually taciturn, and when they talk it is only about Spain, Vienna, Italy, or Petersburg.Names of countries act like springs in their mind; press them, and the ringing of their changes begins."
"“那位菲尔米亚尼夫人常去圣日耳曼区吧，不是吗？”这句话出自一位想要跻身上流社会的人。她把“德”（表示法国贵族身份）字加在每个人的名字前面，如加在大迪潘先生名字前面、加在拉斐特先生名字前面，她把“德”字到处乱加，使很多人蒙羞。这个女人一辈子都在努力了解并且做“正确的事”。但是非常糟糕的是：她住在沼泽区；她的丈夫是一名律师——不过是个皇室法庭的诉讼代理人。","“That Madame Firmiani sees a great deal of the faubourg Saint–Germain, doesn’t she?”This from a person who desires to belong to the class Distinguished.She gives the “de” to everybody,—to Monsieur Dupin senior, to Monsieur Lafayette; she flings it right and left and humiliates many.This woman spends her life in striving to know and do “the right thing”; but, for her sins, she lives in the Marais, and her husband is a lawyer,—a lawyer before the Royal courts, however."
"“菲尔米亚尼夫人吗，先生？我不认识她啊。”这个人属于公爵一类型的。他只认得出入宫廷的女人。请原谅他吧，他是拿破仑时代的产物之一。","“Madame Firmiani, monsieur?I do not know her.”This man belongs to the species Duke.He recognizes none but the women who have been presented at court.Pray excuse him, he was one of Napoleon’s creations."
"“菲尔米亚尼夫人？我肯定她曾在歌剧院演唱。”这是傻子类型的人。这种傻子类型的人对于所有问题都能给出答案。他们宁愿说谎也不愿保持沉默。","“Madame Firmiani?surely she used to sing at the Opera-house.”Species Ninny.The individuals of this species have an answer for everything.They will tell lies sooner than say nothing."
"有两位老妇人，丈夫都是前任地方官。第一位老妇人（戴着一顶有蝴蝶结的帽子，满脸皱纹、鼻子尖尖、声音刺耳，手里拿着一本祷告书）问道：“菲尔米亚尼夫人的娘家姓什么？”第二个老妇人（一张圆脸红得像朵海棠花，声音很温柔）说道：“她娘家姓卡迪央，亲爱的，她是卡迪央老亲王的侄女，所以也就是当今摩弗里纽斯公爵的表妹。”","Two old ladies, wives of former magistrates: The First (wears a cap with bows, her face is wrinkled, her nose sharp, voice hard, carries a prayer-book in her hand): “What was that Madame Firmiani’s maiden name?”—The Second (small face red as a crab-apple, gentle voice): “She was a Cadignan, my dear, niece of the old Prince de Cadignan, consequently cousin to the present Duc de Maufrigneuse.”"
"菲尔米亚尼夫人是卡迪央家族的。她或许品行不端、没有财富、青春不再，但她仍然是卡迪央家族的一员。这就像一种偏见，总是充满活力而有用的。","Madame Firmiani is a Cadignan.She might have neither virtue, nor wealth, nor youth, but she would still be a Cadignan; it is like a prejudice, always alive and working."
"一个怪人说道：“我亲爱的朋友，我从没在她家的候客室里看见过穿木底皮鞋的人。因此，去她家做客不会使你的名声受损，你也可以尽兴地打牌。即使在她的沙龙里有一些顽劣之徒，他们也是乘着马车来的有地位的人。这些人从来不会吵架的。”","An Original: “My dear fellow, I’ve seen no galoshes in her antechamber; consequently you can visit her without compromising yourself, and play cards there without fear; if there are any scoundrels in her salons, they are people of quality and come in their carriages; such persons never quarrel.”"
"一个属于善于观察类型的老人说：“如果你拜访菲尔米亚尼夫人，我亲爱的朋友，你会看到一位漂亮的女士悠闲地坐在她家壁炉旁的角落里。她很少会起身相迎——只有女士、大使、公爵和极有名望的人来了，她才会起身。她非常优雅，颇具魅力；她善于交谈，并且喜欢讨论许多不同的话题。很多迹象都显示她天性热情，但是很明显，她有太多的爱慕者，以至于她没有一个最喜欢的。如果有两个或三个她的密友受到怀疑，我们或许会说一个或者另一个是“献殷勤的仆人”，但是却没有。这位女士是个谜！她已经结婚了，尽管我们谁都没见过她的丈夫。菲尔米亚尼先生完全是个虚构人物。他就像我们雇用的第三匹驿马，付了钱却从不注意它。评论家们说，这位夫人是全欧洲最棒的女低音。但是，打从她来到巴黎后，她演唱不超过三次。她接待了很多的宾客，却从来不去别人家做客。”","Old man belonging to the genus Observer: “If you call on Madame Firmiani, my good friend, you will find a beautiful woman sitting at her ease by the corner of her fireplace.She will scarcely rise to receive you,—she only does that for women, ambassadors, dukes, and persons of great distinction.She is very gracious, she possesses charm; she converses well, and likes to talk on many topics.There are many indications of a passionate nature about her; but she has, evidently, so many adorers that she cannot have a favorite.If suspicion rested on two or three of her intimates, we might say that one or other of them was the “cavaliere servente”; but it does not.The lady is a mystery.She is married, though none of us have seen her husband.Monsieur Firmiani is altogether mythical; he is like that third post-horse for which we pay though we never behold it.Madame has the finest contralto voice in Europe, so say judges; but she has never been heard to sing more than two or three times since she came to Paris.She receives much company, but goes nowhere.”"
"你会注意到的，观察家说的话就像神谕。我们必须把他说的话、讲的事、还有引用的话当作真理来接受，即使我们必须承受被当作没有接受过社会教育或什么都不懂的人的痛苦；承受由此使他饶有兴致地在二十个他被认为是不可或缺的人物的沙龙里诽谤你的痛苦。这位观察家已年至四十，从来也不在家吃饭。他宣称自己对于女人已不再有危险性。他穿一件栗色的外套，在歌剧院的好几个包厢里都留有位子。他有时也被人们看作是个食客，但是他做了很多实事，不应该被看成食客。而且，他在某个省还有处小产业呢，省的名字却从没听他说起过。","The Observer speaks, you will notice, as an Oracle.His words, anecdotes, and quotations must be accepted as truths, under pain of being thought without social education or intelligence, and of causing him to slander you with much zest in twenty salons where he is considered indispensable.The Observer is forty years of age, never dines at home, declares himself no longer dangerous to women, wears a maroon coat, and has a place reserved for him in several boxes at the “Bouffons.”He is sometimes confounded with the Parasite; but he has filled too many real functions to be thought a sponger; moreover he possesses a small estate in a certain department, the name of which he has never been known to utter."
"“菲尔米亚尼夫人？噢，我亲爱的伙计，她是缪拉以前的情妇。”这个人属于自相矛盾型——这种人在回忆录里都有“勘误表”，纠正日期、修改情节。他们打赌的赌注都是一百赔一，对任何事情都很有把握。只需一个晚上，你很容易就在他们身上发现大错。他们会告诉你，在米勒谋反的时候，他们都在巴黎，却忘了半小时前他们才描绘了他们是如何跨过别列津纳河的。几乎所有自相矛盾的人都是荣誉军团中的“骑士”。他们说话大声、前额塌陷，还都豪赌。","“Madame Firmiani?why, my dear fellow, she was Murat’s former mistress.”This man belongs to the Contradictors,—persons who note errata in memoirs, rectify dates, correct facts, bet a hundred to one, and are certain about everything.You can easily detect them in some gross blunder in the course of a single evening.They will tell you they were in Paris at the time of Mallet’s conspiracy, forgetting that half an hour earlier they had described how they had crossed the Beresina.Nearly all Contradictors are “chevaliers” of the Legion of honor; they talk loudly, have retreating foreheads, and play high."
"“菲尔米亚尼夫人一年十万法郎的收入？胡扯，你疯了吧！有些人，就像不需要给他们的女主人公置办嫁妆的作家一样，非常慷慨，会坚持说某人有数百万的收入。菲尔米亚尼夫人就是个卖弄风情的女人，她刚刚毁了一个年轻人，使他再也不能拥有美好的姻缘了。要不是她这么迷人，她一分钱都不会有的。”","“Madame Firmiani a hundred thousand francs a year?nonsense, you are crazy!Some people will persist in giving millions with the liberality of authors, to whom it doesn’t cost a penny to dower their heroines.Madame Firmiani is simply a coquette, who has lately ruined a young man, and now prevents him from making a fine marriage.If she were not so handsome she wouldn’t have a penny.”"
"哈，这个人——你当然认得他——属于爱嫉妒的类型。对于他，我们不需要做任何描述。这类人和家里养的猫一样为人们所熟悉。但是如何解释这种常年存在的嫉妒心呢？那可是一种不会带来任何好处的毛病。","Ah, that one—of course you recognize him—belongs to the species Envious.There is no need to sketch him; the species is as well known as that of the felis domestica.But how to explain the perennial vigor of envy?—a vice that brings nothing in!"
"在1824年1月，交际场上的人、文人、正派的人——简言之，各种各样的人——散布了那么多对于菲尔米亚尼夫人的看法。如果把它们全都写下来，会是非常冗长乏味的。我们只不过想设法说明，一个试图了解她、但却不愿意或没办法去她家的人，（从他问的问题的答案中）同样有理由猜测：她或是一个寡妇、或有丈夫；或愚蠢、或聪明；或道德高尚、或卑鄙恶劣；或富有、或贫穷；或冷漠无情、或感情丰富；或漂亮迷人、或相貌平平。——一句话，社会上有多少类型的人，天主教有多少教派，就会有多少个不同的菲尔米亚尼夫人。","Persons in society, literary men, honest folk,—in short, individuals of all species,—were promulgating in the month of January, 1824, so many different opinions about Madame Firmiani that it would be tedious to write them down.We have merely sought to show that a man seeking to understand her, yet unwilling or unable to go to her house, would (from the answers to his inquiries) have had equal reason to suppose her a widow or wife, silly or wise, virtuous or the reverse, rich or poor, soulless or full of feeling, handsome or plain,—in short, there were as many Madame Firmianis as there are species in society, or sects in Catholicism."
"想起来都吓人！我们都像是一块块用于平版印刷的石头，从这些石版上，可以复制出无数苛责的话语——这些印稿差不多和原稿一样，差别几乎难以察觉，以至于我们的声誉竟取决于——除了朋友的污蔑和报纸的戏谑之外——评判者在费力前行的真理与得益于巴黎人“智慧”的谬误之间如何权衡。","Frightful reflection! we are all like lithographic blocks, from which an indefinite number of copies can be drawn by criticism,—the proofs being more or less like us according to a distribution of shading which is so nearly imperceptible that our reputation depends (barring the calumnies of friends and the witticisms of newspapers) on the balance struck by our criticisers between Truth that limps and Falsehood to which Parisian wit gives wings."
"菲尔米亚尼夫人，像其他高贵端庄的女性一样，把自己的心变成了一处圣地，蔑视整个世界。因此，德布尔博讷先生很容易就会对她完全判断错误。这位先生是个老乡绅，在这年冬天，他有理由对这位女士“关怀备至”。他属于外省农场主那一类型的，靠自己的田产生活，习惯了对一切事情都斤斤计较、和农民讨价还价。就这样一旦干上了这一行，人不知不觉就变精明了，就好像一个士兵在长期服役后变得勇敢了一样。这个老绅士是一个受人尊敬、有教养的人。为了满足自己对于菲尔米亚尼夫人的好奇心，他从都兰来到了巴黎。他听到的那些巴黎人讲的流言蜚语一点儿也满足不了他。他唯一的继承人是他的外甥。他很爱这个外甥，也正是为了他，才种的白杨树。当一个人愉快地想起他的继承人，看着树木一天天越长越好，并且知道将来可以从中获益的时候，他对于树的喜爱之情，随着每在树根旁多铲一下，也会多加一分。尽管这种不寻常的情感很少见，但在都兰还是会被接受的。","Madame Firmiani, like other noble and dignified women who make their hearts a sanctuary and disdain the world, was liable, therefore, to be totally misjudged by Monsieur de Bourbonne, an old country magnate, who had reason to think a great deal about her during the winter of this year.He belonged to the class of provincial Planters, men living on their estates, accustomed to keep close accounts of everything and to bargain with the peasantry.Thus employed, a man becomes sagacious in spite of himself, just as soldiers in the long run acquire courage from routine.The old gentleman, who had come to Paris from Touraine to satisfy his curiosity about Madame Firmiani, and found it not at all assuaged by the Parisian gossip which he heard, was a man of honor and breeding.His sole heir was a nephew, whom he greatly loved, in whose interests he planted his poplars.When a man thinks without annoyance about his heir, and watches the trees grow daily finer for his future benefit, affection grows too with every blow of the spade around her roots.Though this phenomenal feeling is not common, it is still to be met with in Touraine."
"他这个心爱的外甥名叫奥克塔夫·德康，是著名的德康神父的后代。这位神父在爱书之人和博学之士中都极具声望——顺便提一下，他们这两种人可一点儿也不一样。外省人有个坏习惯，就是喜欢用些冠冕堂皇的话指责那些卖了祖产的年轻人。这种陈旧的偏见严重地妨碍了投机买卖，而当局政府为了自身的利益，是鼓励这么做的。最近，奥克塔夫没有和他的舅舅商量，就把他名下的一处产业卖给了黑帮。要不是他的舅舅给“锄头公司”的代表们写了抗议书，维莱纳庄园就会被拆毁了。为了更加激怒老人，一个远方亲戚——那些善用卑劣伎俩，非常狡猾的亲戚中的一个，精明的外省人会这样评论他们：“我是决不会和他打官司的！”——宛如偶然地来拜访德布尔博讷先生，还在不经意间告诉他，他的外甥破产了。这个来访者说，奥克塔夫·德康先生把所有的财产都挥霍在了一个叫菲尔米亚尼夫人的人身上，现在他已沦落到教数学糊口的地步了。他只等着他的舅舅过世，却不敢让舅舅知道他的放荡生活。这位远亲，夏尔·莫尔式的人物，并不耻于把这个致命的消息告诉老绅士。而此时老绅士正坐在炉火旁，享用一顿丰盛的外省晚餐。","This cherished nephew, named Octave de Camps, was a descendant of the famous Abbe de Camps, so well known to bibliophiles and learned men,—who, by the bye, are not at all the same thing.People in the provinces have the bad habit of branding with a sort of decent reprobation any young man who sells his inherited estates.This antiquated prejudice has interfered very much with the stock-jobbing which the present government encourages for its own interests.Without consulting his uncle, Octave had lately sold an estate belonging to him to the Black Band. The chateau de Villaines would have been pulled down were it not for the remonstrances which the old uncle made to the representatives of the “Pickaxe company.”To increase the old man’s wrath, a distant relative (one of those cousins of small means and much astuteness about whom shrewd provincials are wont to remark, “No lawsuits for me with him!”) had, as it were by accident, come to visit Monsieur de Bourbonne, and incidentally informed him of his nephew’s ruin.Monsieur Octave de Camps, he said, having wasted his means on a certain Madame Firmiani, was now reduced to teaching mathematics for a living, while awaiting his uncle’s death, not daring to let him know of his dissipations.This distant cousin, a sort of Charles Moor, was not ashamed to give this fatal news to the old gentleman as he sat by his fire, digesting a profuse provincial dinner."
"这些人的目标就是买进地产，然后把它们分割，再一小块一小块地卖给农民或其他人。","whose object was to buy in landed estates, cut them up, and sell them off in small parcels to the peasantry, or others."
"但是继承者们并不是总能如他们所愿，轻易地摆脱他们的叔伯、舅舅们。因为过于固执，这位特别的舅舅拒绝相信这件事情。而且，在听到发生在他外甥身上的事情后，他突然发作的消化不良也被治愈了。一些打击会影响心脏，另一些会影响脑部，但在这个病例中，远亲的打击落在了消化器官上，并且几乎没造成任何伤害，因为老人的胃口很健康。德布尔博讷就像圣托马的一个真正信徒一样来到了巴黎，而奥克塔夫根本不知道他来了，他下定决心要把他外甥破产的事儿问个明白。因为他和住在圣日耳曼区的利斯图梅尔家族、勒农古家族，还有旺德内斯家族都相识，所以听到了很多关于菲尔米亚尼夫人的传言。有很多是真实的，也有很多是编造的。所以他决定以德鲁克塞莱这个名字——也就是他在都兰田产的名字——亲自到她家去会会她。这个精明的老绅士精心挑选了一个晚上，他知道这个晚上奥克塔夫将会忙着完成一件报酬很不错的工作——之所以要这么做是因为这位所谓的菲尔米亚尼夫人的情人仍然还会去她家里——这种情况似乎难以解释。至于奥克塔夫破产这件事，很不幸，倒不是虚构的。德布尔博讷先生很快就发现了这件事。","But heirs cannot always rid themselves of uncles as easily as they would like to.Thanks to his obstinacy, this particular uncle refused to believe the story, and came out victorious from the attack of indigestion produced by his nephew’s biography.Some shocks affect the heart, others the head; but in this case the cousin’s blow fell on the digestive organs and did little harm, for the old man’s stomach was sound.Like a true disciple of Saint Thomas, Monsieur de Bourbonne came to Paris, unknown to Octave, resolved to make full inquiries as to his nephew’s insolvency.Having many acquaintances in the faubourg Saint-Germain, among the Listomeres, the Lenoncourts, and the Vandenesses, he heard so much gossip, so many facts and falsities, about Madame Firmiani that he resolved to be presented to her under the name of de Rouxellay, that of his estate in Touraine.The astute old gentleman was careful to choose an evening when he knew that Octave would be engaged in finishing a piece of work which was to pay him well,—for this so-called lover of Madame Firmiani still went to her house; a circumstance that seemed difficult to explain.As to Octave’s ruin, that, unfortunately, was no fable, as Monsieur de Bourbonne had at once discovered."
"德鲁克塞莱先生可不是竞技剧场舞台上出现的外省舅父。因为曾在国王近卫队任职，他经常出入上流社会，很讨女人欢心。他知道如何在上流社会表现得彬彬有礼，不失古风；他言辞得体，通晓整个宪章，或宪章的绝大部分。尽管他高尚而坦诚地表达他对波旁家族的爱戴，像绅士们一样信仰上帝，并且只读《每日新闻》，但是他并不像他们省的那些自由派们认为的那么可笑。在宫廷这个圈子里，只要人们不和他谈论《摩西在埃及》，也不谈论歌剧、浪漫主义、地域色彩或铁路，他就可以表现得大方得体。他从来都只是谈论德伏尔泰先生、德布丰伯爵先生、佩罗内和皇后最喜欢的乐师格卢克骑士。","Monsieur de Rouxellay was not at all like the provincial uncle at the Gymnase.Formerly in the King’s guard, a man of the world and a favorite among women, he knew how to present himself in society with the courteous manners of the olden time; he could make graceful speeches and understand the whole Charter, or most of it.Though he loved the Bourbons with noble frankness, believed in God as a gentleman should, and read nothing but the “Quotidienne,” he was not as ridiculous as the liberals of his department would fain have had him.He could hold his own in the court circle, provided no one talked to him of “Moses in Egypt,” nor of the drama, or romanticism, or local color, nor of railways.He himself had never got beyond Monsieur de Voltaire, Monsieur le Comte de Buffon, Payronnet, and the Chevalier Gluck, the Queen’s favorite musician."
"“夫人，”当他挽着德利斯图梅尔侯爵夫人的胳膊来到菲尔米亚尼夫人的沙龙时，他对侯爵夫人说道，“如果这个女人是我外甥的情妇的话，我真是同情他。她怎么能明知他住在阁楼里，自己却住在这么奢华的地方？她就没有一点儿良心吗？奥克塔夫是个傻瓜，让出了维莱纳的田产，竟然是为了这么一个——”","“Madame,” he said to the Marquise de Listomere, who was on his arm as they entered Madame Firmiani’s salons, “if this woman is my nephew’s mistress, I pity him.How can she live in the midst of this luxury, and know that he is in a garret?Hasn’t she any soul?Octave is a fool to have given up such an estate as Villaines for a—”"
"德布尔博讷先生属于守旧派，用的都是古旧的语言。","Monsieur de Bourbonne belonged to the species Fossil, and used the language of the days of yore."
"“但是，如果他是把那些钱输在赌局上了呢？”","“But suppose he had lost it at play?”"
"“那样的话，夫人，他至少享受了赌博的乐趣。”","“Then, madame, he would at least have had the pleasure of gambling.”"
"“那么你认为他在这儿就没有获得任何乐趣吗？仔细看看吧！看看菲尔米亚尼夫人。”","“And do you think he has had no pleasure here?See!look at Madame Firmiani.”"
"一看到他外甥那所谓的情妇，老人最愉快的记忆也褪色了。当他看到她，听到她嘴里发出亲切的问候声时，他的愤怒已荡然无存了。那些幸运的意外事件只会发生在漂亮女人身上，而在这一刻，或许是因为烛光，或许是因为她的衣服大方得体，或许是因为环绕在她身旁的难以言表的优雅氛围，她的美散发着独特的光彩。一个人必定是研究过巴黎夜晚的沙龙有哪些特别之处后，才能体会那细微的光与影会怎样修饰女性的脸庞，并使它变得不同。此刻，这个巴黎女郎满意于自己的妆容与智慧，因人们的赞美而欣喜不已，在这个满是冲她微笑着的优秀男士的沙龙里，她感觉自己如女王一般，也完全了解自己的优雅与魅力。她捕捉到了人们看她的眼神，那是种无声的殷勤，也因此变得更加美丽，而她又把这殷勤通过微妙的眼神传递给了她爱的人。在这样的时刻，一个女人好像被赋予了超自然的力量，变成了一个魔法师，魅力无穷，她自己都没有意识到这一点。不知不觉地，她心中激荡着爱意，使得她的一眸一笑都令人神魂颠倒。如果这一来自内心的光彩甚至可以让一个相貌平平的女人变得迷人，那对于一个生性优雅、举止非凡、美丽、富有活力、眼睛发光、穿衣品味令艺术家和她的死对头都不得不佩服的女人来说，这种光彩会折射出何等光芒呢？","The brightest memories of the old man faded at the sight of his nephew’s so-called mistress.His anger died away at the gracious exclamation which came from his lips as he looked at her.By one of those fortunate accidents which happen only to pretty women, it was a moment when all her beauties shone with peculiar lustre, due perhaps to the wax-lights, to the charming simplicity of her dress, to the ineffable atmosphere of elegance that surrounded her.One must needs have studied the transitions of an evening in a Parisian salon to appreciate the imperceptible lights and shades which color a woman’s face and vary it.There comes a moment when, content with her toilet, pleased with her own wit, delighted to be admired, and feeling herself the queen of a salon full of remarkable men who smile to her, the Parisian woman reaches a full consciousness of her grace and charm; her beauty is enhanced by the looks she gathers in,—a mute homage which she transfers with subtle glances to the man she loves.At moments like these a woman is invested with supernatural power and becomes a magician, a charmer, without herself knowing that she is one; involuntarily she inspires the love that fills her own bosom; her smiles and glances fascinate.If this condition, which comes from the soul, can give attraction even to a plain woman, with what radiance does it not invest a woman of natural elegance, distinguished bearing, fair, fresh, with sparkling eyes, and dressed in a taste that wrings approval from artists and her bitterest rivals."
"你是否有幸曾遇到过这样一个女人，她悦耳的声音使她的话语如她的举止一般，魅力无穷？她知道表达和倾听的技巧；她的措辞听起来都那么得体而完美，她言辞精妙，总是说你所想。她幽默又不失亲切，她的评论从不中伤他人；她从不侃侃而谈，也不争执，但她喜欢发起话题，并且知道适可而止。她非常友善，笑容可掬；她的礼貌发自内心；她总是那么殷勤，却没有丝毫的奴颜媚骨；她把她应得的尊重化于朦胧的影子；她也从不会让你感觉疲倦。当你离开时，不论是对她，还是对自己，都会感觉非常地满意。她的优雅迷人已经感染了她周围的一切。她身上的一切都赏心悦目；好像有她在的地方，你就能呼吸到故土的芬芳。这个女人自然得体。她没有花丝毫的力气；也不祈求任何结果；她的种种情感让人一目了然，因为它们都如此真实。尽管如此真诚坦率，她却不会道破别人的虚荣；上帝造人，无论什么样子，她都能接受；对品行不端的人，她予以同情，对于种种瑕疵以及荒谬的行径，她给予原谅；她能理解不同年龄的人；任何事都不会让她焦躁，因为她有本事预见一切。她温柔而快乐，在她还没安慰人之前，已经可以让人高兴起来了。你是那么爱她，即使这个天使做错了什么，你也会原谅她的。如果你曾有幸遇见过这么一个女人，你就知道菲尔米亚尼夫人是一个什么样的人了。","Have you ever, for your happiness, met a woman whose harmonious voice gives to her speech the same charm that emanates from her manners?a woman who knows how to speak and to be silent, whose words are happily chosen, whose language is pure, and who concerns herself in your interests with delicacy?Her raillery is caressing, her criticism never wounds; she neither discourses nor argues, but she likes to lead a discussion and stop it at the right moment.Her manner is affable and smiling, her politeness never forced, her readiness to serve others never servile; she reduces the respect she claims to a soft shadow; she never wearies you, and you leave her satisfied with her and with yourself.Her charming grace is conveyed to all the things with which she surrounds herself.Everything about her pleases the eye; in her presence you breathe, as it were, your native air.This woman is natural.There is no effort about her; she is aiming at no effect; her feelings are shown simply, because they are true.Frank herself, she does not wound the vanity of others; she accepts men as God made them; pitying the vicious, forgiving defects and absurdities, comprehending all ages, and vexed by nothing, because she has had the sense and tact to foresee all.Tender and gay, she gratifies before she consoles.You love her so well that if this angel did wrong you would be ready to excuse her.If, for your happiness, you have met with such a woman, you know Madame Firmiani."
"德布尔博讷先生坐在她身旁，和她聊了十分钟之后，就已经原谅了他的外甥。他觉察到，不论事实如何，菲尔米亚尼夫人和奥克塔夫之间的关系都隐藏着某种秘密。这位老绅士仿佛回到了那些装点青春岁月的幻想之中，又出于她的美貌，便断定，一个看起来天生就知道自重的女人是不会做任何错事的。她乌黑的眼睛透出内心的平和；她脸部的线条是那么高雅，轮廓是那么完美，而他要查证的这段情看起来几乎没有使她烦恼；那么美的面容又怎么会少了爱心与美德呢？这一切使得老人心里想：“我的外甥一定是做了什么蠢事。”","After Monsieur de Bourbonne had talked with her for ten minutes, sitting beside her, his nephew was forgiven.He perceived that whatever the actual truth might be, the relation between Madame Firmiani and Octave covered some mystery.Returning to the illusions that gild the days of youth, and judging Madame Firmiani by her beauty, the old gentleman became convinced that a woman so innately conscious of her dignity as she appeared to be was incapable of a bad action.Her dark eyes told of inward peace; the lines of her face were so noble, the profile so pure, and the passion he had come to investigate seemed so little to oppress her heart, that the old man said to himself, while noting all the promises of love and virtue given by that adorable countenance, “My nephew is committing some folly.”"
"菲尔米亚尼夫人说自己只有二十五岁。但是那些生性实际的人证实了，她在1813年十六岁时嫁给了那位不爱露面的叫菲尔米亚尼的人（当时他四十多岁，极受人尊敬），到了1825年，她至少二十八岁了。然而，同样是这些人，他们也都声称她一生中从来也没有如现在这样如此迷人，如此具有成熟女性的风韵。她现在正处于女性最易于充满激情的年龄；而在她们情绪低落的时候，或许也正是最渴望激情的时刻。她拥有这世上所有出售、出让和给予的一切。使馆随员们声称没有什么事她不知道；自相矛盾者们断言她还有许多事情应该学习；善于观察的人说她的双手白皙、双足娇小，走起路来稍嫌不稳。然而，各种类型的人都嫉妒或质疑奥克塔夫的幸运。但他们偶尔也会达成一致，都认为菲尔米亚尼夫人是巴黎最有贵族气派、最美的女人。","Madame Firmiani acknowledged to twenty-five.But the Practicals proved that having married the invisible Firmiani (then a highly respectable individual in the forties) in 1813, at the age of sixteen, she must be at least twenty-eight in 1825.However the same persons also asserted that at no period of her life had she ever been so desirable or so completely a woman.She was now at an age when women are most prone to conceive a passion, and to desire it, perhaps, in their pensive hours.She possessed all that earth sells, all that it lends, all that it gives.The Attaches declared there was nothing of which she was ignorant; the Contradictors asserted that there was much she ought to learn; the Observers remarked that her hands were white, her feet small, her movements a trifle too undulating.But, nevertheless, individuals of all species envied or disputed Octave’s happiness, agreeing, for once in a way, that Madame Firmiani was the most aristocratically beautiful woman in Paris."
"菲尔米亚尼夫人仍然年轻、富有，还是一位了不起的音乐家；她机智、聪慧、有教养，作为卡迪央家族的一员，她受到过德布拉蒙·肖夫里王妃的接见，那可是贵族区说一不二的人物。她还受到她的对手们的喜爱：她的表妹德摩佛里纽斯公爵夫人、德埃斯帕侯爵夫人以及德玛居梅夫人。菲尔米亚尼夫人使所有这些滋养或激起爱情的虚荣心都得到了满足。因此，她被许多人追求，也难免成为巴黎人怨恨和诽谤的牺牲品，人们躲在扇子后或身旁的纱橱后娇媚地耳语，说出那些中伤之言。在故事一开始引用种种对于菲尔米亚尼夫人的评论还是很有必要的，由此，我们才能了解与社交界眼中不同的、真实的菲尔米亚尼夫人。即使一些女人不再对她的幸运耿耿于怀，而另一些女人对于她行事大方得体却不能释怀。目前在巴黎，没有什么比毫无根据的猜疑更危险的了，因为要消灭它们是根本不可能的。","Still young, rich, a perfect musician, intelligent, witty, refined, and received (as a Cadignan) by the Princesse de Blamont–Chauvry, that oracle of the noble faubourg, loved by her rivals the Duchesse de Maufrigneuse her cousin, the Marquise d’Espard, and Madame de Macumer,—Madame Firmiani gratified all the vanities which feed or excite love.She was therefore sought by too many men not to fall a victim to Parisian malice and its charming calumnies, whispered behind a fan or in a safe aside.It was necessary to quote the remarks given at the beginning of this history to bring out the true Firmiani in contradistinction to the Firmiani of society.If some women forgave her happiness, others did not forgive her propriety.Now nothing is so dangerous in Paris as unfounded suspicions,—for the reason that it is impossible to destroy them."
"我们大致描述了这个真实、本色的女人，只能让人对她有个模糊的了解。只有如安格尔般的人手中的画笔才能描绘出她眉宇间的高傲，她发丝的浓密，她眼神中透出的尊严以及那双颊变换的色彩所流露出的内心世界。她身上具备一切特质；诗人可以在她身上看到阿涅丝·索雷尔和圣女贞德的身影；可以看到一个不可捉摸的女人以及藏在那个躯壳里的灵魂，夏娃的灵魂；她熟知所有的善与恶，过失与顺从，罪恶与奉献；她是拜伦勋爵笔下的唐娜·朱莉娅和海蒂。","This sketch of a woman who was admirably natural gives only a faint idea of her.It would need the pencil of an Ingres to render the pride of that brow, with its wealth of hair, the dignity of that glance, and the thoughts betrayed by the changing colors of her cheeks.In her were all things; poets could have found an Agnes Sorel and a Joan of Arc, also the woman unknown, the Soul within that form, the soul of Eve, the knowledge of the treasures of good and the riches of evil, error and resignation, crime and devotion, the Donna Julia and the Haidee of Lord Byron."
"在其他客人都走后，这位前近卫军留了下来，很明显这是不恰当的。菲尔米亚尼夫人看到他静静地坐在她面前的一把椅子上，显然他决意要留下来，就像一只顽固的苍蝇，只有把它拍死才能摆脱掉它。时钟的指针已经指向凌晨两点了。","The former guardsman stayed, with apparent impertinence, after the other guests had left the salons; and Madame Firmiani found him sitting quietly before her in an armchair, evidently determined to remain, with the pertinacity of a fly which we are forced to kill to get rid of it.The hands of the clock marked two in the morning."
"菲尔米亚尼夫人站起身，希望能让他明白，如果他告辞，她将求之不得，这时，老绅士开口说道，“夫人，我是奥克塔夫·德康先生的舅舅。”","“Madame,” said the old gentlemen, as Madame Firmiani rose, hoping to make him understand that it was her good pleasure he should go, “Madame, I am the uncle of Monsieur Octave de Camps.”"
"菲尔米亚尼夫人立刻坐了下来，表现得不再那么平静了。不管这位老种植园主有多精明，他也无法辨别出她脸色变得苍白是因为羞愧，还是因为高兴。她是高兴的，这位端庄的女士试图掩饰这惬意的感觉。但她再稳重，也无法躲避这突然一击。一个女人越敏感，她就越试图隐藏她灵魂深处的快乐。许多女人，脾气反复无常，让人难以理解。她们有时渴望听到一个名字，而在其他时候，却希望把它深深埋在心底。德布尔博讷先生并不认为菲尔米亚尼夫人的激动心情，都是源于此：宽恕他吧，所有的外省人都是疑神疑鬼的。","Madame Firmiani immediately sat down again, and showed her emotion.In spite of his sagacity the old Planter was unable to decide whether she turned pale from shame or pleasure.There are pleasures, delicious emotions the chaste heart seeks to veil, which cannot escape the shock of startled modesty.The more delicacy a woman has, the more she seeks to hide the joys that are in her soul.Many women, incomprehensible in their tender caprices, long to hear a name pronounced which at other times they desire to bury in their hearts.Monsieur de Bourbonne did not interpret Madame Firmiani’s agitation exactly in this way: pray forgive him, all provincials are distrustful."
"“哦，先生？”菲尔米亚尼夫人说道，她看了他一眼，眼神那么清亮、透彻，我们男人从来都不会从这种眼神中看出什么，因为我们有太多的疑问。","“Well, monsieur?” said Madame Firmiani, giving him one of those clear, lucid glances in which we men can never see anything because they question us too much."
"“啊，夫人，”老先生答道，“您知道有个人到我那偏僻的外省去告诉我什么了吗？他说我外甥因为您而毁了他自己，还说那个可怜的家伙现在住在阁楼上，而您却是锦衣华府。请原谅我的粗鲁、坦白，了解一下那些造谣中伤或许对您有好处。”","“Well, madame,” returned the old man, “do you know what some one came to tell me in the depths of my province?That my nephew had ruined himself for you, and that the poor fellow was living in a garret while you were in silk and gold.Forgive my rustic sincerity; it may be useful for you to know of these calumnies.”"
"“别说了，先生。”菲尔米亚尼夫人用命令式的手势打断了他的话，“我都知道。您是知礼的，如果我请您别再讨论这个话题，您是不会再继续说的吧；而且您也是有风度的——就这个词的古义而言。”她略带嘲讽地加了一句，“您没有权利质问我，这您也是同意的吧。为自己辩白真是很可笑。我相信您对我的品行会有很高的评价，您会相信对于钱我是完全蔑视的——我向您保证——尽管我嫁了一个很有钱的人，当时却身无分文。对我而言，您的外甥是贫是富都无所谓；如果我曾经在这里接纳过他，现在也会接纳他，那是因为我认为他值得做我的朋友。先生，我所有的朋友都相互尊重；他们知道我不会允许我不尊重的人来我的家；这或许是因为我不够宽容；但是直到今日，我的守护神还是令我对闲言碎语和欺诈不忠的事情深恶痛绝。”","“Stop, monsieur,” said Madame Firmiani, with an imperative gesture; “I know all that.You are too polite to continue this subject if I request you to leave it, and too gallant—in the old-fashioned sense of the word,” she added with a slight tone of irony—“not to agree that you have no right to question me.It would be ridiculous in me to defend myself.I trust that you will have a sufficiently good opinion of my character to believe in the profound contempt which, I assure you, I feel for money,—although I was married, without any fortune, to a man of immense wealth.It is nothing to me whether your nephew is rich or poor; if I have received him in my house, and do now receive him, it is because I consider him worthy to be counted among my friends.All my friends, monsieur, respect each other; they know that I have not philosophy enough to admit into my house those I do not esteem; this may argue a want of charity; but my guardian-angel has maintained in me to this day a profound aversion for tattle, and also for dishonesty.”"
"一开始，她的语调微微往上提了一些，到了最后几个字，她已说得很轻松，泰然自若，就好像塞利梅纳在嘲弄那些恨世者们一样。","Through the ring of her voice was slightly raised during the first part of this answer, the last words were said with the ease and self-possession of Celimene bantering the Misanthrope."
"“夫人，”德布尔博讷先生有点儿激动地说道，“我现在老了，可以说我就是奥克塔夫的爸爸。请您原谅我要冒昧地问您一个问题。我向您保证，我是个信守诺言的君子，您的答复我不会讲给任何人听。”他边说边把手放在胸前，这个老式的动作看起来非常地虔诚，“那些谣言是真的吗？你爱奥克塔夫吗？”","“Madame,” said Monsieur de Bourbonne, in a voice of some emotion, “I am an old man; I am almost Octave’s father, and I ask your pardon most humbly for the question that I shall now venture to put to you, giving you my word of honor as a loyal gentleman that your answer shall die here,”—laying his hand upon his heart, with an old-fashioned gesture that was truly religious.“Are these rumors true; do you love Octave?”"
"“先生，”她回答道，“换了其他任何人，我只会看他一眼就算答复了；但是对您我不会那样，因为您确实可以说是德康先生的父亲。我问您，对于回答这样一个问题的女人，您是怎么看她的呢？当我们所爱的人也爱我们，我们会坦承我们的爱——啊！或许吧；但是请相信我先生，即使我们确定他会永远爱我们，那对于我们而言也是付出，而对于他则是回馈。但对于其他人——”","“Monsieur,” she replied, “to any other man I should answer that question only by a look; but to you, and because you are indeed almost the father of Monsieur de Camps, I reply by asking what you would think of a woman if to such a question she answered you?To avow our love for him we love, when he loves us—ah!that may be; but even when we are certain of being loved forever, believe me, monsieur, it is an effort for us, and a reward to him.To say to another!—”"
"她没有把话说完就站了起来，向老人鞠了一躬后，就回到私人套房里去了。房间的门在她身后开开合合，在老人听来，好像也在诉说着什么。","She did not end her sentence, but rose, bowed to the old man, and withdrew into her private apartments, the doors of which, opening and closing behind her, had a language of their own to his sagacious ears."
"“呀！胡闹啊！”他心里想，“这么一个女人！她要么是个狡猾的人，要么就是天使。”他上了雇来的马车，寂静的院子里响起了噔噔的马蹄声。车夫在咒骂了他不守时的主顾上百次后，刚才已在座位上睡着了。","“Ah!the mischief!” thought he; “what a woman!she is either a sly one or an angel”; and he got into his hired coach, the horses of which were stamping on the pavement of the silent courtyard, while the coachman was asleep on his box after cursing for the hundredth time his tardy customer."
"第二天早晨八点左右，老绅士来到一幢位于教会街的房子，拾级而上，奥克塔夫·德康就住在这里。当这个年轻的教师看到他舅舅时，再没有什么能令他更加吃惊的了。门没锁，灯还亮着，他一夜都没睡。","The next morning about eight o’clock the old gentleman mounted the stairs of a house in the rue de l’Observance where Octave de Camps was living.If there was ever an astonished man it was the young professor when he beheld his uncle.The door was unlocked, his lamp still burning; he had been sitting up all night."
"“你这个坏家伙！”德布尔博讷先生边说边坐在了最近的一张椅子上，“从什么时候开始，唯一的继承人们开始流行起嘲笑他们的舅舅了？这些舅舅们可是每年都能从田产上收益两万六千法郎呢。告诉你，从前我们都是很敬畏这样的舅舅呢。来，说啊，你对我有什么不满意的？我没有做好一个舅舅应当做的事情吗？我有命令你尊敬我吗？我拒绝过给你钱吗？每次你假装来照料我的身体，我什么时候把你拒之门外了？你的舅舅不是全法国最随和、最没有架子的舅舅吗？——我不敢说全欧洲，那就有些太自大了。无论你写信给我，或者不写，我是靠着你所承诺的对我的情意活着的。我给你准备了整个都兰最好的田产，全省的人都嫉妒。当然，我打算将它留到最后一刻再给你，但是这个念头是可以理解的，不是吗？而你自己又做了些什么？——变卖了自己的财产，活得像个仆人一样！”","“You rascal!” said Monsieur de Bourbonne, sitting down in the nearest chair; “since when is it the fashion to laugh at uncles who have twenty-six thousand francs a year from solid acres to which we are the sole heir?Let me tell you that in the olden time we stood in awe of such uncles as that.Come, speak up, what fault have you to find with me?Haven’t I played my part as uncle properly?Did I ever require you to respect me?Have I ever refused you money?When did I shut the door in your face on pretence that you had come to look after my health?Haven’t you had the most accommodating and the least domineering uncle that there is in France,—I won’t say Europe, because that might be too presumptuous.You write to me, or you don’t write,—no matter, I live on pledged affection, and I am making you the prettiest estate in all Touraine, the envy of the department.To be sure, I don’t intend to let you have it till the last possible moment, but that’s an excusable little fancy, isn’t it?And what does monsieur himself do?—sells his own property and lives like a lackey!—”"
"“舅舅——.”","“Uncle—”"
"“我现在不是说舅舅呢，是在说外甥。我应该得到你的信任。来吧，立刻坦白，依照我的经验，这是最容易的办法。你赌过钱吗？你在交易所赔了钱吗？如果你说‘舅舅，我是个坏家伙’，我会原谅你的。但如果你撒谎，而且比我在你这个年龄时撒的谎还要大的话，我就会卖了我的财产，买一份养老金，再去过我年轻时的荒唐日子——如果我还可以的话。”","“I’m not talking about uncles, I’m talking nephew.I have a right to your confidence.Come, confess at once; it is much the easiest way; I know that by experience.Have you been gambling?have you lost money at the Bourse?Say, ‘Uncle, I’m a wretch,’ and I’ll hug you.But if you tell me any lies greater than those I used to tell at your age I’ll sell my property, buy an annuity, and go back to the evil ways of my youth—if I can.”"
"“舅舅——.”","“Uncle—”"
"“我昨天见过你的菲尔米亚尼夫人了。”老人继续说，合拢了手指，嘴唇碰了一下手指尖，“她很有魅力。你可以获得舅舅的赞许，如果这对你有用的话。至于想取得教会的认可，我认为那是没用的，而且这年头，宗教仪式花费太大了。说啊，你是为了她才把自己毁了的吗？”","“I saw your Madame Firmiani yesterday,” went on the old fellow, kissing the tips of his fingers, which he gathered into a bunch.“She is charming.You have the consent and approbation of your uncle, if that will do you any good.As to the sanction of the Church I suppose that’s useless, and the sacraments cost so much in these days.Come, speak out, have you ruined yourself for her?”"
"“是的，舅舅。”","“Yes, uncle.”"
"“哎！这个荡妇！我早应该知道的。我那个时候，宫廷里的女人比起交际花来，更知道怎么毁掉一个男人。但是这个女人——我看清楚了！——她就有点儿像上个世纪的女人。”","“Ha!the jade!I’d have wagered it.In my time the women of the court were cleverer at ruining a man than the courtesans of today; but this one—I recognized her!—it is a bit of the last century.”"
"“舅舅，”奥克塔夫温柔而严肃地说，“您完全错了。菲尔米亚尼夫人值得您去尊重，也理应得到世人对她的所有爱慕。”","“Uncle,” said Octave, with a manner that was tender and grave, “you are totally mistaken.Madame Firmiani deserves your esteem, and all the adoration the world gives her.”"
"“年轻人啊，年轻人！都是这个样子！”德布尔博讷先生喊道，“好吧，你继续说吧；给我说说你那老套的故事吧。但请记住，我对英勇果敢的理解可不过时。”","“Youth, youth!always the same!” cried Monsieur de Bourbonne.“Well, go on; tell me the same old story.But please remember that my experience in gallantry is not of yesterday.”"
"“我敬爱、善良的舅舅，这儿有一封信，几乎可以让您了解所有的情况。”奥克塔夫说着，把信从一个讲究的夹子里拿了出来，那夹子肯定是她送的礼物，“当您读完这封信，我会告诉您剩下的事。那时，您就会了解一个不被世人所知的菲尔米亚尼夫人了。”","“My dear, kind uncle, here is a letter which will tell you nearly all,” said Octave, taking it from an elegant portfolio, her gift, no doubt.“When you have read it I will tell you the rest, and you will then know a Madame Firmiani who is unknown to the world.”"
"“我没戴眼镜。大声读出来吧。”","“I haven’t my spectacles; read it aloud.”"
"奥克塔夫开始读了：","Octave began:—"
"“‘我亲爱的——’”","“‘My beloved—’”"
"他的舅舅打断他说：“嘿，这么说你和她还是很亲密啊？”","“Hey, then you are still intimate with her?” interrupted his uncle."
"“是啊，当然了。”","“Why yes, of course.”"
"“你还没和她分手吗？”","“You haven’t parted from her?”"
"“分手！”奥克塔夫重复了一遍，“我们结婚了。”","“Parted!” repeated Octave, “we are married.”"
"“天哪！”德布尔博讷先生大声说道，“那你为什么还住在阁楼？”","“Heavens!” cried Monsieur de Bourbonne, “then why do you live in a garret?”"
"“让我继续念吧。”","“Let me go on.”"
"“好——我听着呢。”","“True—I’m listening.”"
"奥克塔夫继续读那封信，但有些段落，他读得极为动情。","Octave resumed the letter, but there were passages which he could not read without deep emotion."
"“‘我亲爱的丈夫，你问我为什么伤心。悲伤已经从我的内心摆在我的脸上吗？还是你只是猜的呢？——但是你怎么可能看不出来呢？我们的心可是相连的。我无法欺骗你；这或许是不幸的，因为在幸福的爱情里，妻子应该是快乐和充满爱意的。或许我应该欺骗你，但是我决不会那么做的，即使这让我幸福、让我深深陶醉的快乐是建立于此的。","“‘My beloved Husband,—You ask me the reason of my sadness.Has it, then, passed from my soul to my face; or have you only guessed it?—but how could you fail to do so, one in heart as we are?I cannot deceive you; this may be a misfortune, for it is one of the conditions of happy love that a wife shall be gay and caressing.Perhaps I ought to deceive you, but I would not do it even if the happiness with which you have blessed and overpowered me depended on it."
"“‘啊！我最亲爱的，对于这份爱我是多么感激。我渴望永远地爱你，没有尽头。是的，我渴望永远以你为荣。女人的荣耀就在于她所爱的男人。一个人如要拥有了我们给予的尊重、体谅、敬意，他就不能赋予其他人吗？然而，我的天使堕落了。是的，亲爱的，你告诉我的那件事玷污了我往日的快乐。从那时起，因为你我感到羞愧——我一向认为，你是世上男人中最令人尊敬的一个，因为你是最深情的、最温柔的。只有充分相信你那颗年轻又纯洁的心，我才能向你坦白这些，而这需要我付出沉重的代价。啊！我最亲爱的，明明知道你的父亲卑鄙地剥夺了其他人的财产，你怎么还能保留它呢？","“‘Ah!dearest, how much gratitude there is in my love.I long to love you forever, without limit; yes, I desire to be forever proud of you.A woman’s glory is in the man she loves.Esteem, consideration, honor, must they not be his who receives our all?Well, my angel has fallen.Yes, dear, the tale you told me has tarnished my past joys.Since then I have felt myself humiliated in you,—you whom I thought the most honorable of men, as you are the most loving, the most tender.I must indeed have deep confidence in your heart, so young and pure, to make you this avowal which costs me much.Ah!my dear love, how is it that you, knowing your father had unjustly deprived others of their property, that YOU can keep it?"
"“‘在那间无声地见证了我们的爱的房间里，你告诉了我这件罪行。你是君子，你认为自己是高尚的，而我是属于你的！我试着为你找寻借口；我也确实找到了：因为你年轻、考虑不周。我知道你身上还是有孩子气的。或许你从未认真想过什么是财富，什么是正直。哦！你的笑声刺痛着我。想想那被毁掉而总是身处困境的家庭吧；可怜的年轻女孩子们有理由每天咒骂你；老父亲每晚都会自言自语：“如果那个人的爸爸是个诚实的人，或许我们现在就不会挨饿了……”’”","“‘And you told me of this criminal act in a room filled with the mute witnesses of our love; and you are a gentleman, and you think yourself noble, and I am yours!I try to find excuses for you; I do find them in your youth and thoughtlessness.I know there is still something of the child about you.Perhaps you have never thought seriously of what fortune and integrity are.Oh!how your laugh wounded me.Reflect on that ruined family, always in distress; poor young girls who have reason to curse you daily; an old father saying to himself each night: “We might not now be starving if that man’s father had been an honest man—”’”"
"“老天啊！”德布尔博讷先生大声打断了他的外甥，“你不会蠢得把你父亲和布尔纳夫一家的事告诉了那个女人吧？比起挣钱，女人更懂得如何挥霍。”","“Good heavens!” cried Monsieur de Bourbonne, interrupting his nephew, “surely you have not been such a fool as to tell that woman about your father’s affair with the Bourgneufs?Women know more about wasting a fortune than making one.”"
"“她们知道什么是正直。但请让我继续念吧，舅舅。”","“They know about integrity.But let me read on, uncle.”"
"“‘奥克塔夫，世上没有人有权利改变荣誉的法则。问问你的良心，问问你是以什么方式获得了你所拥有的财产。’”","“‘Octave, no power on earth has authority to change the principles of honor.Look into your conscience and ask it by what name you are to call the action by which you hold your property.’”"
"外甥看着舅舅，后者低下了头。","The nephew looked at the uncle, who lowered his head."
"“‘我不会告诉你所有那些折磨我的想法；它们归根结底就一条，那就是：我没办法尊敬一个为了一笔钱有意毁了自己的男人，不论这笔钱是多少——赌博时偷的五法郎，或者是通过法律花招得来的五十万——都是很丢脸的。我会告诉你一切。正是这份至今都是我全部快乐的爱使我觉得丢脸。我心里总有一个声音，那是我敏感的心无法抑制的。啊！正因为我感觉到我的良心战胜了我的爱，我哭泣过。如果你犯了罪，我会把你藏在怀里，让你躲避审判，但我的爱仅到此而已。爱情，对于一个女人而言，意味着无尽的信任，这份信任与她对于所属的人所需要的敬畏和尊重相连。我从来都认为爱情就是一把火，在这火里所有高尚的情感都变得更加纯洁——也正是这爱情之火加深了这些情感。","“‘I will not tell you all the thoughts that assail me; they can be reduced to one,—this is it: I cannot respect the man who, knowingly, is smirched for a sum of money, whatever the amount may be; five francs stolen at play or five times a hundred thousand gained by a legal trick are equally dishonoring.I will tell you all.I feel myself degraded by the very love which has hitherto been all my joy.There rises in my soul a voice which my tenderness cannot stifle.Ah!I have wept to feel that I have more conscience than love.Were you to commit a crime I would hide you in my bosom from human justice, but my devotion could go no farther.Love, to a woman, means boundless confidence, united to a need of reverencing, of esteeming, the being to whom she belongs.I have never conceived of love otherwise than as a fire in which all noble feelings are purified still more,—a fire which develops them."
"“‘我只有一件事要说：放弃那些钱，回到我的身边吧，我会加倍地爱你。如果你不这么做，就是放弃了我的爱。如果我没再见到你，我知道那意味着什么。","“‘I have but one thing else to say: come to me poor, and my love shall be redoubled.If not, renounce it.Should I see you no more, I shall know what it means."
"“‘但请明白，我不希望你归还那笔财产并不是是因为我的劝说。问问你自己的良心吧。像这样的正义之举不应该是为爱所做的牺牲。我是你的妻子，不是你的情人，这并非是要取悦我，而是要唤起我内心深处真正的尊重。","“‘But I do not wish, understand me, that you should make restitution because I urge it.Consult your own conscience.An act of justice such as that ought not to be a sacrifice made to love.I am your wife and not your mistress, and it is less a question of pleasing me than of inspiring in my soul a true respect."
"“‘如果是我弄错了，如果是你没有解释清楚你父亲的行为，简言之，如果你仍然认为你对这财产的所有权是正当的（哦！我说服了自己很久来相信你是无可指责的），请倾听你内心的声音来考虑问题、做出决定；要完全并且只按照自己的内心行事。一个男人如果真挚地爱着一个女人，就如你爱着我一样，他会发自内心地尊重她对于他神圣的信任，绝不会使他自己蒙羞。","“‘If I am mistaken, if you have ill-explained your father’s action, if, in short, you still think your right to the property equitable (oh! how I long to persuade myself that you are blameless), consider and decide by listening to the voice of your conscience; act wholly and solely from yourself.A man who loves a woman sincerely, as you love me, respects the sanctity of her trust in him too deeply to dishonor himself."
"“‘对于我写的这些话，我要道歉；本来一句话或许就够了，我却在这儿说教！责备我吧；我希望你责备我——但是不要太严厉，稍微说一下吧。亲爱的，我们两人之间你更有能力——仅你自己就可以察觉你犯的错。’”","“‘I blame myself now for what I have written; a word might have sufficed, and I have preached to you!Scold me; I wish to be scolded,—but not much, only a little.Dear, between us two the power is yours—you alone should perceive your own faults.’”"
"“就这些，舅舅？”奥克塔夫说着，双眼满是泪水。","“Well, uncle?” said Octave, whose eyes were full of tears."
"“信里还说了别的吧，念完吧。”","“There’s more in the letter; finish it.”"
"“哦，剩下的是只有爱人可以看的。”奥克塔夫微笑着答道。","“Oh, the rest is only to be read by a lover,” answered Octave, smiling."
"“是的，说得对，我的孩子。”老人温柔地说道，“当年我也有很多情事的，但是请你相信，我也爱过，‘我也曾经幸福过’。但是我还是不明白，你为什么教数学呢？”","“Yes, right, my boy,” said the old man, gently.“I have had many affairs in my day, but I beg you to believe that I too have loved, ‘et ego in Arcadia.’But I don’t understand yet why you give lessons in mathematics.”"
"“亲爱的舅舅，我是您的外甥；这不就是说我已经动用过父亲留给我的钱吗？我读了这封信后，内心就起了某种变化。在那一天里，我为迟来的懊悔付出了代价。我无法向您描述我当时的心情。当我驾着马车时，一个声音向我喊道：‘这匹马不属于你’；当我吃晚饭时，那个声音响了起来：‘这饭是你偷来的’。我很愧疚。我的正直感越强烈，这种愧疚感越鲜明。我跑去找菲尔米亚尼夫人。舅舅！那天我感觉到了内心的快乐、精神的愉悦，这要比百万财产更重要。我们一起算出了应付给布尔纳夫一家多少钱，而且我不顾菲尔米亚尼夫人的意见，还惩罚自己多付百分之三的利息。但是我所有的钱也不够支付全部金额。我们非常相爱，她会拿出她的积蓄，我本也可以接受——”","“My dear uncle, I am your nephew; isn’t that as good as saying that I had dipped into the capital left me by my father?After I had read this letter a sort of revolution took place within me.I paid my whole arrearage of remorse in one day.I cannot describe to you the state I was in.As I drove in the Bois a voice called to me, ‘That horse is not yours’; when I ate my dinner it was saying, ‘You have stolen this food.’I was ashamed.The fresher my honesty, the more intense it was.I rushed to Madame Firmiani.Uncle!that day I had pleasures of the heart, enjoyments of the soul, that were far beyond millions.Together we made out the account of what was due to the Bourgneufs, and I condemned myself, against Madame Firmiani’s advice, to pay three per cent interest.But all I had did not suffice to cover the full amount.We were lovers enough for her to offer, and me to accept, her savings—”"
"“什么！除了其他的那些美德，这个可爱的女人还存钱吗？”他的舅舅喊道。","“What!besides her other virtues does that adorable woman lay by money?” cried his uncle."
"“别嘲笑她，舅舅；她的处境让她不得不非常小心。她的丈夫1820年去了希腊，三年后死在了那里。目前为止，我们既拿不到合法证据确定他的死亡，也不可能得到他立的那份遗嘱，遗嘱说，他要把全部财产留给他的妻子。那些文件或是丢了，或是被偷，或者是在希腊的动乱中遗失了——那个国家记录在案的东西可不像在法国这样保管的，而且我们那儿也没有领事。因为不确定她是否会被迫放弃她的财产，她行事都尽可能谨慎小心。至于我，我希望能得到属于我的财产，这样，万一我的妻子被迫丢掉了她的财产，我可以供养她。”","“Don’t laugh at her, uncle; her position has obliged her to be very careful.Her husband went to Greece in 1820 and died there three years later.It has been impossible, up to the present time, to get legal proofs of his death, or obtain the will which he made leaving his whole property to his wife.These papers were either lost or stolen, or have gone astray during the troubles in Greece,—a country where registers are not kept as they are in France, and where we have no consul.Uncertain whether she might not be forced to give up her fortune, she has lived with the utmost prudence.As for me, I wish to acquire property which shall be mine, so as to provide for my wife in case she is forced to lose hers.”"
"“但是你为什么不把这些都告诉我？我亲爱的外甥，你应该知道我非常爱你，我会为你偿还所有体面的债务——一个绅士所欠的债务。我现在就要做个传统的舅舅了，我要为自己雪耻！”","“But why didn’t you tell me all this?My dear nephew, you might have known that I love you enough to pay all your good debts, the debts of a gentleman.I’ll play the traditional uncle now, and revenge myself!”"
"“啊！舅舅，我理解您的伤痛！但是请让我通过自己的努力变得富有吧。如果您真想帮忙，就每年给我两三千法郎的零花钱吧，直到我找到想做的事业，需要投资的时候。现在，我很高兴，能够维持生计是我唯一的渴望了。我教书，这样我活着也不会以牺牲任何人的利益为代价。真希望您能明白我做这些补偿让我有多快乐！我费了很大劲儿找到了布尔纳夫一家，他们日子过得很穷，什么都缺。老父亲是个卖彩票的；两个女儿替他管账，也料理家务；她们的母亲总是生病。两个女儿都很有魅力，但是残酷的现实教会了她们：世人都看不起那些漂亮的穷人。说得多么有道理！我进去的时候是罪恶的帮凶；离开时是个诚实的人，也洗刷了父亲的坏名声。舅舅，我没有指责他的意思；一场官司里总是太刺激、太富有激情，即使是一个可敬的人也会被引入歧途。律师们可以使最不合理的要求变得合法；法律总能演绎出合适的推论，让人泯灭良心。我的拜访颇具戏剧性。这完全是天意，我实现了那个一般不可能实现的愿望：‘上帝每年能给我们两万法郎该多好啊’——这是每个人都会有的愚蠢愿望，真可笑；对于在发着昏暗光线的灯旁边，围着微弱的泥炭火堆坐着，希望家能变得富裕起来的人们来说——不，这已经无法用言语表达了。我这超乎寻常的正义感在他们看来却是不正常的。好吧！如果有天堂的话，我的父亲现在在那儿是快乐的。至于我，我得到的爱超过了以往任何的男人。菲尔米亚尼夫人给予我的不只是快乐；她用她那细腻的情感启发了我，而这种情感我想正是我所缺乏的。所以我称她为我的良知——这是在我们内心表达某种私密融洽的爱语。我发现正直是有回报的；我很快会通过自己的努力变得富有的。我脑海里已经有了一个产业计划，如果成功，我会赚几百万的。”","“Ah!uncle, I know your vengeance!but let me get rich by my own industry.If you want to do me a real service, make me an allowance of two or three thousand francs a year, till I see my way to an enterprise for which I shall want capital.At this moment I am so happy that all I desire is just the means of living.I give lessons so that I may not live at the cost of any one.If you only knew the happiness I had in making that restitution!I found the Bourgneufs, after a good deal of trouble, living miserably and in need of everything.The old father was a lottery agent; the two daughters kept his books and took care of the house; the mother was always ill.The daughters are charming girls, but they have been cruelly taught that the world thinks little of beauty without money.What a scene it was!I entered their house the accomplice in a crime; I left it an honest man, who had purged his father’s memory.Uncle, I don’t judge him; there is such excitement, such passion in a lawsuit that even an honorable man may be led astray by them.Lawyers can make the most unjust claims legal; laws have convenient syllogisms to quiet consciences.My visit was a drama.To be Providence itself; actually to fulfil that futile wish, ‘If heaven were to send us twenty thousand francs a year,’—that silly wish we all make, laughing; to bring opulence to a family sitting by the light of one miserable lamp over a poor turf fire!—no, words cannot describe it.My extreme justice seemed to them unjust.Well!if there is a Paradise my father is happy in it now.As for me, I am loved as no man was ever loved yet.Madame Firmiani gives me more than happiness; she has inspired me with a delicacy of feeling I think I lacked.So I call her my dear conscience,—a love-word which expresses certain secret harmonies within our hearts.I find honesty profitable; I shall get rich in time by myself.I’ve an industrial scheme in my head, and if it succeeds I shall earn millions.”"
"“哦！我的孩子，你拥有你母亲的情操。”老人说着，眼中充满了泪，那是对姐姐的思念。","“Ah!my boy, you have your mother’s soul,” said the old man, his eyes filling at the thought of his sister."
"正在这时，尽管奥克塔夫的阁楼离街道很远，这个年轻人还是听到了马车的声音。","Just then, in spite of the distance between Octave’s garret and the street, the young man heard the sound of a carriage."
"“她来了！”他大声说，“听那些马停下的声音就能知道。”","“There she is!” he cried; “I know her horses by the way they are pulled up.”"
"过了一会儿，菲尔米亚尼夫人就进来了。","A few moments more, and Madame Firmiani entered the room."
"“啊！”看见德布尔博讷先生后，她喊了一声，并做了一个不耐烦的手势。“舅舅在也没关系。”她很快就笑着说道，“我来是恳请我的丈夫接受我的财产的。奥地利大使馆刚刚给我寄来了一份文件，证明菲尔米亚尼先生已经去世，也证实了那份遗嘱。遗嘱被他的贴身男仆安全地保管着，直到交到我的手中。奥克塔夫，你可以接受全部的财产；你比我富有，因为在这里，”（她把手放在胸前）“你有最珍贵的东西，只有上帝才可以让它更充盈。”说罢，她无法抑制自己的幸福，把头倚在了丈夫的胸前。","“Ah!” she exclaimed, with a gesture of annoyance at seeing Monsieur de Bourbonne.“But our uncle is not in the way,” she added quickly, smiling; “I came to humbly entreat my husband to accept my fortune.The Austrian Embassy has just sent me a document which proves the death of Monsieur Firmiani, also the will, which his valet was keeping safely to put into my own hands.Octave, you can accept it all; you are richer than I, for you have treasures here” (laying her hand upon his heart) “to which none but God can add.”Then, unable to support her happiness, she laid her head upon her husband’s breast."
"“我亲爱的外甥媳妇，”老人说道，“在我那个时代，我们只是互献殷勤；而今，你们是相爱。你们女人的心肠是世上最好的；你们甚至犯了错也不会内疚，因为那都是我们男人造成的。”","“My dear niece,” said the old man, “in my day we made love; in yours, you love.You women are all that is best in humanity; you are not even guilty of your faults, for they come through us.”"
