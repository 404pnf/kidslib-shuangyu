"第一章","CHAPTER ONE"
"但是，你们也许会说，我们要求你讲的是女人和小说——这和一个自己的房间有什么关系呢？我会全力说明的。当初你们要求我讲女人和小说的时候，我就坐在河岸边，开始想这几个字的含义。也许它们只是意味着关于范尼·伯尼的几句评论，再加上几句对简·奥斯汀的评论，对勃朗特姐妹的赞扬，以及对白雪覆盖下的霍沃思牧师公寓的概述；如果有可能，再说一些关于米特福德小姐的俏皮话，恭敬地提一提乔治·艾略特，然后论及加斯克尔夫人，这样就算完事了。但是再看一看，这几个字的含义似乎并不那么简单。“女人和小说”这个题目也许是指女人和她们的样子，这也可能也是你们想要传递的意思，它也许是指女人和她们所写的小说，也许是指女人和关于她们的小说，或者是指这三个意思不知怎的就难解难分地混在了一起，而你们想要我从这个角度来考虑它们。但是当我用最后这种看上去最为有趣的方式开始思考这个主题时，我马上发现，它有一个致命的缺点。我永远也得不出一个结论。我永远也不能在一个小时的演讲之后，给你们一个有价值的纯粹的真理，让你们把它包在笔记本的页张之间，永远保留在壁炉架上，而我知道，这是一个演讲者的第一责任。我所能做的就是，就一个小问题给你们一个观点——一个女人要写小说，她必须有钱，有一个她自己的房间；你们会看到，这就使得女人真正的性格以及小说真正的性质这个大问题得不到解决。我逃避了责任，没有对这两个问题下一个结论，我认为，女人和小说仍是悬而未决的问题。但是为了做一些补偿，我将做我所能做的，给你们解释我这个关于房间和钱的观点是怎么形成的。我将在你们面前，把导致我产生这个想法的思路尽可能充分而自由地展开来。如果我将这一观点背后的想法和偏见也表达出来，你们也许会发现，它们与女人有些关系，与小说也有些关系。无论如何，当一个题目颇具争议时——所有关于性别的问题都是如此——人们也就不指望说出真理了。他只能解释自己所持的那个观点是如何形成的。他只能给听众一个机会，让他们在观察演讲者的局限、偏见、癖好的时候，得出他们自己的结论。在这里，小说包含的真理可能多于事实。因此，我打算，利用一个小说家所有的特权和自由，告诉你们我到这儿来的前两天发生的事情——被你们放在我肩上的题目给压倒后，我如何思考这个题目，如何把它用在我日常生活的里里外外。我不需要说，我将要描述的东西并不存在，“牛津剑桥”是捏造的，“弗恩汉姆”也是，“我”也只是为了方便而给某个并不真实存在的人起的名称。谎话将从我的嘴里流淌出来，但可能也有一些真理掺杂其中；要让你们去寻找这真理，并且决定哪些部分是值得保留的。如果不这样做，你们当然会把它整个扔到废纸篓里，然后忘得一干二净。","But, you may say, we asked you to speak about women and fiction—what, has that got to do with a room of one’s own?I will try to explain.When you asked me to speak about women and fiction I sat down on the banks of a river and began to wonder what the words meant.They might mean simply a few remarks about Fanny Burney; a few more about Jane Austen; a tribute to the Brontes and a sketch of Haworth Parsonage under snow; some witticisms if possible about Miss Mitford; a respectful allusion to George Eliot; a reference to Mrs Gaskell and one would have done.But at second sight the words seemed not so simple.The title women and fiction might mean, and you may have meant it to mean, women and what they are like, or it might mean women and the fiction that they write; or it might mean women and the fiction that is written about them, or it might mean that somehow all three are inextricably mixed together and you want me to consider them in that light.But when I began to consider the subject in this last way, which seemed the most interesting, I soon saw that it had one fatal drawback.I should never be able to come to a conclusion.I should never be able to fulfil what is, I understand, the first duty of a lecturer to hand you after an hour’s discourse a nugget of pure truth to wrap up between the pages of your notebooks and keep on the mantelpiece for ever.All I could do was to offer you an opinion upon one minor point—a woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction; and that, as you will see, leaves the great problem of the true nature of woman and the true nature of fiction unsolved.I have shirked the duty of coming to a conclusion upon these two questions—women and fiction remain, so far as I am concerned, unsolved problems.But in order to make some amends I am going to do what I can to show you how I arrived at this opinion about the room and the money.I am going to develop in your presence as fully and freely as I can the train of thought which led me to think this.Perhaps if I lay bare the ideas, the prejudices, that lie behind this statement you will find that they have some bearing upon women and some upon fiction.At any rate, when a subject is highly controversial—and any question about sex is that—one cannot hope to tell the truth.One can only show how one came to hold whatever opinion one does hold.One can only give one’s audience the chance of drawing their own conclusions as they observe the limitations, the prejudices, the idiosyncrasies of the speaker.Fiction here is likely to contain more truth than fact.Therefore I propose, making use of all the liberties and licences of a novelist, to tell you the story of the two days that preceded my coming here—how, bowed down by the weight of the subject which you have laid upon my shoulders, I pondered it, and made it work in and out of my daily life.I need not say that what I am about to describe has no existence; Oxbridge is an invention; so is Fernham; ‘I’ is only a convenient term for somebody who has no real being.Lies will flow from my lips, but there may perhaps be some truth mixed up with them; it is for you to seek out this truth and to decide whether any part of it is worth keeping.If not, you will of course throw the whole of it into the waste-paper basket and forget all about it."
"那么这就是我（可以叫我玛丽·贝顿，玛丽·西顿，玛丽·卡迈克尔，或者任何你喜欢的名字——这完全不重要），一两个星期前，在十月晴朗的天气里，我坐在河岸边，陷入了沉思。我所说的那个衣领，也就是女人和小说，以及对一个引起各种偏见和强烈情感的题目下结论的需要，把我的头压到了地上。我的左边和右边都长着某种灌木，是金黄色和深红色的，那火一般的颜色明亮夺目，甚至就像是炉火在燃烧。远处的河岸边，垂杨带着永久的悲哀，它们的头发披在肩上。河水倒映着它从天空、桥梁和燃烧的树木中挑选出来的各种东西，一个大学生划着船穿过了这些倒影，但它们很快就又完整地合上了，好像那个大学生从未来过一样。一个人可以在那坐上一昼夜，沉浸在思考中。思考——这是给它的一个它不太配的光荣的名字——已经把它的钓线垂到河里去了。一分钟又一分钟，钓线在倒影和水草之间四处摆动，随着水流漂起沉下，直到——你知道那轻轻地一拉——一个想法忽然聚到了钓线的末端，然后小心地把它拉进来，再把它仔细地摊开。唉，我这摊在草地上的思想看起来多么渺小，多么无足轻重啊，就好像那种被高明的渔夫放回水中的小鱼，好让它长得肥点，有一天值得拿来煮着吃。我现在不拿那个思想来烦你们，虽然你们仔细观察的话，可能会在我说话的过程中发现它。","Here then was I (call me Mary Beton, Mary Seton, Mary Carmichael or by any name you please—it is not a matter of any importance) sitting on the banks of a river a week or two ago in fine October weather, lost in thought.That collar I have spoken of, women and fiction, the need of coming to some conclusion on a subject that raises all sorts of prejudices and passions, bowed my head to the ground.To the right and left bushes of some sort, golden and crimson, glowed with the colour, even it seemed burnt with the heat, of fire.On the further bank the willows wept in perpetual lamentation, their hair about their shoulders.The river reflected whatever it chose of sky and bridge and burning tree, and when the undergraduate had oared his boat through the reflections they closed again, completely, as if he had never been.There one might have sat the clock round lost in thought.Thought—to call it by a prouder name than it deserved—had let its line down into the stream.It swayed, minute after minute, hither and thither among the reflections and the weeds, letting the water lift it and sink it until—you know the little tug—the sudden conglomeration of an idea at the end of one’s line: and then the cautious hauling of it in, and the careful laying of it out?Alas, laid on the grass how small, how insignificant this thought of mine looked; the sort of fish that a good fisherman puts back into the water so that it may grow fatter and be one day worth cooking and eating.I will not trouble you with that thought now, though if you look carefully you may find it for yourselves in the course of what I am going to say."
"但是无论多么渺小，它依然有它那种神秘的性质——把它放到脑子里，它就立刻变得非常令人兴奋，变得很重要；它猛冲下沉、四处闪现的时候，激起了汹涌的水流和巨大的波动，以至于我不可能再静静地坐着。于是，我急速地穿过一片草地。一个男人的身影立刻出现了。他过来阻拦我。起初我还不明白，这个人看上去很奇怪，穿着常礼服以及晚上穿的衬衫，原来他所做的手势是针对我的。他的脸上写着恐惧和愤怒。是本能而不是理智帮了我的忙；他是教区执事，而我是个女人。这是草皮，小路在那边。这里只允许研究员和学者来，砾石路才是给我的地方。这些想法都是一瞬间产生的。我重回到小路上，教区执事的手臂就放下了，他的脸上恢复了通常的平静；尽管草皮比砾石路走着舒服，但我也没造成什么很大的伤害。不管是什么学院的研究员和学者，我能够针对他们提出的唯一控诉就是，这块草皮被连续压了300年，他们在保护它的时候，把我的小鱼吓得藏了起来。","But however small it was, it had, nevertheless, the mysterious property of its kind—put back into the mind, it became at once very exciting, and important; and as it darted and sank, and flashed hither and thither, set up such a wash and tumult of ideas that it was impossible to sit still.It was thus that I found myself walking with extreme rapidity across a grass plot.Instantly a man’s figure rose to intercept me. Nor did I at first understand that the gesticulations of a curious-looking object, in a cut-away coat and evening shirt, were aimed at me. His face expressed horror and indignation.Instinct rather than reason came to my help, he was a Beadle; I was a woman.This was the turf; there was the path.Only the Fellows and Scholars are allowed here; the gravel is the place for me. Such thoughts were the work of a moment.As I regained the path the arms of the Beadle sank, his face assumed its usual repose, and though turf is better walking than gravel, no very great harm was done.The only charge I could bring against the Fellows and Scholars of whatever the college might happen to be was that in protection of their turf, which has been rolled for 300 years in succession they had sent my little fish into hiding."
"是什么想法让我大胆地闯入了草地，我现在已经记不得了。安谧的精神就像云一样从天上降下来，如果说安谧的精神存在于某一个地方的话，那它就是在十月的一个晴朗的早晨，存在于牛津剑桥的庭院和四方形场地里。漫步穿过那些学院，经过那些古老的大厅，当前的不愉快似乎消失了，身体好像被装在一个不可思议的小玻璃房间里，任何声音都不能传进去。同时脑子因为没有接触任何事实（除非再次闯到草地上去），可以自由地沉浸在与这个时刻相协调的各种冥想中。有一篇老文章是讲在漫长的假期重访牛津剑桥，我对这篇文章有零星的记忆，这些记忆碰巧让我想起了查尔斯·拉姆——萨克雷把一封拉姆的信放在他的前额上时说，圣徒查尔斯。确实，在所有死去的文人中（我有了什么想法，就会告诉你们），拉姆是最亲切的之一，人们会想对他说，那么告诉我，你怎么写散文？我认为，他的散文甚至比马克斯·比尔博姆的还要好——尽管后者的散文很完美，这是因为想象力的疯狂闪现，因为文章中天才的像闪电一样的噼啪声，这虽然使他的文章有了缺点，并不完美，但也使它们闪耀着诗意。大约在一百年前拉姆来过牛津剑桥，当然他写了一篇散文——题目我忘了，是关于他在这儿看见的弥尔顿的一首诗的手稿。大概是《利西达斯》，拉姆写道，想到《利西达斯》中的任何一个字都可以被其他的字所取代，他震惊不已。想到弥尔顿改了那首诗里的字，这在他看来似乎是一种渎圣行为。这使我想起我所能记得的《利西达斯》的一部分，并猜测着哪些字弥尔顿可能改过以及他为什么改，以此自娱；接着我想到，拉姆所看的那个手稿离这儿不过几百码，人们可以追随拉姆的脚步，穿过四方院，来到那个著名的图书馆，那件珍宝就保存在那儿。而且，当我向图书馆走的时候，我记起，这个著名的图书馆里也保存着萨克雷的《埃斯蒙德》的手稿。批评家常说，《埃斯蒙德》是萨克雷最完美的小说。但是根据我的记忆，那矫揉造作的文体，以及它对18世纪的模仿，都是束缚人的；除非18世纪的文体对萨克雷而言确实是自然的——这个事实通过看手稿便可以证明，从手稿上可以看出那些修改是为了文体还是为了意思。但是这样，人们就必须决定什么是文体，什么是意思，这个问题——但这时我其实已经到了通往图书馆的大门的门口。我一定是开了门的，因为立刻就有一位表示反对、满头银发的和蔼绅士走了出来，就像守护天使一样挡住了路，不过挥的是黑袍子而不是白翅膀；他一面挥手叫我后退，一面用低声表示遗憾，说女士得由一位本学院的研究员陪着或是带着介绍信才准进这个图书馆。","What idea it had been that had sent me so audaciously trespassing I could not now remember.The spirit of peace descended like a cloud from heaven, for if the spirit of peace dwells anywhere, it is in the courts and quadrangles of Oxbridge on a fine October morning.Strolling through those colleges past those ancient halls the roughness of the present seemed smoothed away; the body seemed contained in a miraculous glass cabinet through which no sound could penetrate, and the mind, freed from any contact with facts (unless one trespassed on the turf again), was at liberty to settle down upon whatever meditation was in harmony with the moment.As chance would have it, some stray memory of some old essay about revisiting Oxbridge in the long vacation brought Charles Lamb to mind—Saint Charles, said Thackeray, putting a letter of Lamb’s to his forehead.Indeed, among all the dead (I give you my thoughts as they came to me), Lamb is one of the most congenial; one to whom one would have liked to say, Tell me then how you wrote your essays?For his essays are superior even to Max Beerbohm’s, I thought, with all their perfection, because of that wild flash of imagination, that lightning crack of genius in the middle of them which leaves them flawed and imperfect, but starred with poetry.Lamb then came to Oxbridge perhaps a hundred years ago. Certainly he wrote an essay—the name escapes me—about the manuscript of one of Milton’s poems which he saw here.It was LYCIDAS perhaps, and Lamb wrote how it shocked him to think it possible that any word in LYCIDAS could have been different from what it is.To think of Milton changing the words in that poem seemed to him a sort of sacrilege.This led me to remember what I could of LYCIDAS and to amuse myself with guessing which word it could have been that Milton had altered, and why. It then occurred to me that the very manuscript itself which Lamb had looked at was only a few hundred yards away, so that one could follow Lamb’s footsteps across the quadrangle to that famous library where the treasure is kept.Moreover, I recollected, as I put this plan into execution, it is in this famous library that the manuscript of Thackeray’s ESMOND is also preserved.The critics often say that ESMOND is Thackeray’s most perfect novel.But the affectation of the style, with its imitation of the eighteenth century, hampers one, so far as I can remember; unless indeed the eighteenth-century style was natural to Thackeray—a fact that one might prove by looking at the manuscript and seeing whether the alterations were for the benefit of the style or of the sense.But then one would have to decide what is style and what is meaning, a question which—but here I was actually at the door which leads into the library itself.I must have opened it, for instantly there issued, like a guardian angel barring the way with a flutter of black gown instead of white wings, a deprecating, silvery, kindly gentleman, who regretted in a low voice as he waved me back that ladies are only admitted to the library if accompanied by a Fellow of the College or furnished with a letter of introduction."
"一个著名的图书馆被一个女人诅咒过，这对这个著名的图书馆来说，完全是一件不必在乎的事情。它神圣庄严，心平气和，所有珍品都安全地锁在它的胸中；它沾沾自喜地沉睡着，而且我认为，它会永远这样睡下去。我带着满腔怒火走下台阶的时候，我发誓再也不会激起那些回声，再也不去要求它的热情款待。吃午餐之前还有一个小时，该做些什么呢？在草地上散步？在河边坐着？当然，那是一个可爱的秋天的早上，树叶闪着红色飘落到地上；这两件事做起来都不是什么太苦的事。但是音乐声传入耳朵里。某种仪式或庆典正在进行。我走过小礼拜堂的门前时，风琴正在用美妙的乐声诉着苦。在那种晴朗的天气里，甚至连基督教的悲哀听上去都像悲哀的回想，而不是悲哀本身；连古老风琴的呻吟都好像被平静所包住了。假使我有权进去，我也不希望进去；这次，教堂司事也许会拦住我，大概会要求我交出洗礼证明书，或是教务长的介绍信。不过，这些宏伟建筑的外观常常和其内部一样美丽。而且，看着会众们聚集起来，进去又出来，就已经够有趣的了；他们在礼拜堂的门口忙碌着，就像蜜蜂在蜂房的入口处一样。许多人都戴着方帽子，穿着长袍。有的人肩上戴着一簇簇毛皮；有的人坐在轮椅里被人推着；还有的人，尽管还没过中年，却似乎已经皱成了很奇怪的样子，让人想起了水族馆里巨大的螃蟹和龙虾，它们费了很大劲笨拙地穿过沙子。当我斜靠着墙的时候，这所大学实在像一个避难所，里面有很多稀奇古怪的人；如果把这些人放到斯特兰大街的人行道上，让他们去谋生的话，他们很快就会被淘汰。一些老教务长和老学监的以前的故事又回到了我的脑海中，但是，在我鼓足勇气吹口哨之前——过去据说有一位老教授，一听到口哨声，立刻拔腿就跑——那些值得敬重的会众已经进去了。礼拜堂的外面还是照旧。你知道，它那高高的圆顶和尖塔夜里被点亮后，在几英里之外、群山的那一边都能看到，就像一直在航行永不靠岸的帆船一样。据推测，这个四方院，包括它平整的草坪、厚实的建筑以及礼拜堂本身，曾经也是一片沼泽地，当时青草在风中摇摆，猪在拱土觅食。我想，一队队的牛马一定是从很远的地方用四轮车把石头拉来，然后很多很多的劳力把这些灰色的石块整整齐齐地堆起来，一块叠着一块，我现在就站在这些灰色石头的阴影里。然后，油漆工给窗户装上玻璃，泥瓦匠在房顶上忙了几个世纪，带着油灰、水泥、铲子和泥刀。每一个星期六，都一定有人从皮制的钱袋里倒出一些金子和银子，倒到这些老工匠的手中，因为他们晚上大概要喝啤酒，玩撞柱游戏。我想，一定有源源不断的金银不断地流进这个院子，使得石头不断被运进来，也使得泥瓦匠不停地工作——整平、开沟、挖掘、排水。但是，当时是一个信仰的时代，大量的钱被倒进来，以便把这些石头立在很深的地基上。房子建起来后，皇帝、皇后和显赫的贵族们又从他们的钱柜里拿出了更多的钱，确保这儿唱着圣歌，教着学生。土地有人赏赐；十一税也有人缴纳。但信仰的时代过去，理智的时代到来的时候，仍然有同样多的金银流进来；于是，设立了奖学金，捐赠了讲师基金。只不过，金银现在不是从皇室的钱柜中流出来的了，而是从商人和制造商的钱箱里流出来的，是从那些比如说靠工业发了财的人的钱包里流出来的，在遗嘱中，他们将很大一部分财富回馈给大学，捐给他们，让他们聘请更多的教授和讲师，设立更多的奖学金。当时，他们就是在这些大学里学到了手艺。","That a famous library has been cursed by a woman is a matter of complete indifference to a famous library.Venerable and calm, with all its treasures safe locked within its breast, it sleeps complacently and will, so far as I am concerned, so sleep for ever.Never will I wake those echoes, never will I ask for that hospitality again, I vowed as I descended the steps in anger.Still an hour remained before luncheon, and what was one to do?Stroll on the meadows? sit by the river?Certainly it was a lovely autumn morning; the leaves were fluttering red to the ground; there was no great hardship in doing either.But the sound of music reached my ear. Some service or celebration was going forward.The organ complained magnificently as I passed the chapel door.Even the sorrow of Christianity sounded in that serene air more like the recollection of sorrow than sorrow itself; even the groanings of the ancient organ seemed lapped in peace.I had no wish to enter had I the right, and this time the verger might have stopped me, demanding perhaps my baptismal certificate, or a letter of introduction from the Dean.But the outside of these magnificent buildings is often as beautiful as the inside.Moreover, it was amusing enough to watch the congregation assembling, coming in and going out again, busying themselves at the door of the chapel like bees at the mouth of a hive.Many were in cap and gown; some had tufts of fur on their shoulders; others were wheeled in bath-chairs; others, though not past middle age, seemed creased and crushed into shapes so singular that one was reminded of those giant crabs and crayfish who heave with difficulty across the sand of an aquarium.As I leant against the wall the University indeed seemed a sanctuary in which are preserved rare types which would soon be obsolete if left to fight for existence on the pavement of the Strand.Old stories of old deans and old dons came back to mind, but before I had summoned up courage to whistle—it used to be said that at the sound of a whistle old Professor  instantly broke into a gallop—the venerable congregation had gone inside.The outside of the chapel remained.As you know, its high domes and pinnacles can be seen, like a sailing-ship always voyaging never arriving, lit up at night and visible for miles, far away across the hills.Once, presumably, this quadrangle with its smooth lawns, its massive buildings and the chapel itself was marsh too, where the grasses waved and the swine rootled.Teams of horses and oxen, I thought, must have hauled the stone in wagons from far countries, and then with infinite labour the grey blocks in whose shade I was now standing were poised in order one on top of another, and then the painters brought their glass for the window, and the masons were busy for centuries up on that roof with putty and cement, spade and trowel.Every Saturday somebody must have poured gold and silver out of a leathern purse into their ancient fists, for they had their beer and skittles presumably of an evening.An unending stream of gold and silver, I thought, must have flowed into this court perpetually to keep the stones coming and the masons working; to level, to ditch, to dig and to drain.But it was then the age of faith, and money was poured liberally to set these stones on a deep foundation, and when the stones were raised, still more money was poured in from the coffers of kings and queens and great nobles to ensure that hymns should be sung here and scholars taught.Lands were granted; tithes were paid.And when the age of faith was over and the age of reason had come, still the same flow of gold and silver went on; fellowships were founded; lectureships endowed; only the gold and silver flowed now, not from the coffers of the king, but from the chests of merchants and manufacturers, from the purses of men who had made, say, a fortune from industry, and returned, in their wills, a bounteous share of it to endow more chairs, more lectureships, more fellowships in the university where they  had learnt their craft."
"因此有了图书馆，实验室和观象台，还有昂贵、精致的仪器，它们构成的光彩夺目的设备立在玻璃架子上，而几个世纪之前，就在这里，青草随风摇晃，猪用鼻子拱着土。当然，当我在院子中四处漫步时，金银构建的基础似乎足够深了，铺在野草上的人行道也足够结实。头上顶着托盘的人匆忙地从一个楼梯走到另一个楼梯。窗口花坛中，华丽的花开着。留声机响亮的旋律从里面的屋子里传出来。不可能不去深思——无论深思的是什么，它可能已被打断了。是该去吃午饭的时候了。","Hence the libraries and laboratories; the observatories; the splendid equipment of costly and delicate instruments which now stands on glass shelves, where centuries ago the grasses waved and the swine rootled.Certainly, as I strolled round the court, the foundation of gold and silver seemed deep enough; the pavement laid solidly over the wild grasses.Men with trays on their heads went busily from staircase to staircase.Gaudy blossoms flowered in window-boxes.The strains of the gramophone blared out from the rooms within.It was impossible not to reflect—the reflection whatever it may have been was cut short.The clock struck.It was time to find one’s way to luncheon."
"小说家有办法使我们相信，午餐会总是难忘的的，因为有人会说诙谐的话，或是有人会做机智的事，这个事实是很奇怪的。但是他们很少谈及所吃的东西。这是小说家习俗的一部分，就是不去提汤、鲑鱼和小鸭子，好像它们不重要似的，好像没有人曾经吸过一支雪茄或喝过一杯酒似的。但是，在这儿我要冒昧地违背这个习俗，告诉你们，这次午饭是以鳎鱼开始的，它被盛在深深的盘子里，学校的厨子在上面铺了一层床罩似的白色奶油，只是它四处点缀着棕色的小点，像雌鹿胁腹上的点一样。然后上的是山鹑，但是你们若以为它们只是盘子上躺着的两只无毛的棕色的鸟，你们就错了。各种各样且数量繁多的山鹑，带着它们的酱汁、生菜等所有随员而来，其中有味道浓的，也有甜的，全都排列有序。一起来的还有土豆片，它们像钱币一样薄，但又没有那么硬；还有甘蓝，就像玫瑰花蕾一样是一层一层的，却更美味多汁。烤山鹑及其随员刚被吃完，寡言的男佣人，也可能是表现得比较温和的教区执事本人，就把甜食放到我们面前；用餐巾缠绕着的甜食让所有白糖都从大海里涌了出来。如果称它为布丁并且将它与大米、木薯淀粉联系起来，那是对它的一种侮辱。同时，玻璃酒杯中奔涌着黄色和红色的酒，杯子空了，又满了。因此，在脊柱（灵魂所在的地方）的中间，渐渐被点亮的并不是我们称之为才华的那种刺目的微小电光——这种才华在我们的嘴上啪啪地进进出出，而是更深刻、更微妙、更隐蔽的光辉，那是理性交流的色彩浓烈的黄色火焰。不需要着急。不需要才华横溢。不需要成为自己以外的任何人。我们都终将走进天堂与范戴克为伴——换句话说，当一个人点燃一支好烟、坐到窗座的垫子中时，生活看起来多么美好，它的回报多么让人高兴，这个积怨或那个怨愤多么渺小，友谊和与同类朋友的交往又是多么令人钦佩。","It is a curious fact that novelists have a way of making us believe that luncheon parties are invariably memorable for something very witty that was said, or for something very wise that was done.But they seldom spare a word for what was eaten.It is part of the novelist’s convention not to mention soup and salmon and ducklings, as if soup and salmon and ducklings were of no importance whatsoever, as if nobody ever smoked a cigar or drank a glass of wine.Here, however, I shall take the liberty to defy that convention and to tell you that the lunch on this occasion began with soles, sunk in a deep dish, over which the college cook had spread a counterpane of the whitest cream, save that it was branded here and there with brown spots like the spots on the flanks of a doe. After that came the partridges, but if this suggests a couple of bald, brown birds on a plate you are mistaken.The partridges, many and various, came with all their retinue of sauces and salads, the sharp and the sweet, each in its order; their potatoes, thin as coins but not so hard; their sprouts, foliated as rosebuds but more succulent.And no sooner had the roast and its retinue been done with than the silent servingman, the Beadle himself perhaps in a milder manifestation, set before us, wreathed in napkins, a confection which rose all sugar from the waves.To call it pudding and so relate it to rice and tapioca would be an insult.Meanwhile the wineglasses had flushed yellow and flushed crimson; had been emptied; had been filled.And thus by degrees was lit, half-way down the spine, which is the seat of the soul, not that hard little electric light which we call brilliance, as it pops in and out upon our lips, but the more profound, subtle and subterranean glow which is the rich yellow flame of rational intercourse.No need to hurry.No need to sparkle.No need to be anybody but oneself.We are all going to heaven and Vandyck is of the company—in other words, how good life seemed, how sweet its rewards, how trivial this grudge or that grievance, how admirable friendship and the society of one’s kind, as, lighting a good cigarette, one sunk among the cushions in the window-seat."
"如果手边刚好有一个烟灰缸，如果一个人没有因为缺少烟灰缸而把烟灰弹到窗外，如果事情与实际状况稍有不同，那么他大概不会看到一只没有尾巴的猫。那只突然出现的、被砍了尾巴的动物轻轻地走过四方院，这一情景侥幸借着下意识的灵性，为我改变了情绪上的看法。好像有人放下了一个罩子。也许是那美妙的白葡萄酒的酒力正在过去。确实，当我看着这只马恩岛猫停在草坪中间，好像它也在质问宇宙时，一些东西看起来欠缺了，一些东西看起来不同了。但是欠缺的是什么，不同的是什么？我在听着谈话的时候，这样问自己。为了回答这个问题，我不得不想象自己离开了这间屋子，回到了过去，而且是回到了战前，并且在我的眼前放置另一个午餐聚会的模型，这个聚会就在离这些房间不太远的另一些房间里举行；但这又是不同的。一切都是不同的。与此同时，客人之间的谈话继续着，客人很多而且很年轻，男女都有。谈话顺利地进行着，进行得很惬意、很自由、很有趣。在谈话继续进行的时候，我把它与另一谈话的背景作了比较，当我把这两场谈话放在一起比较的时候，我毫不怀疑其中一场是另一场的后裔、合法继承人。没有什么发生了改变；没有什么变得不同了，只不过我此时全神贯注地倾听的并不全是讲出的话，而是其背后的窃窃私语抑或气流。对，就是这样——这就是改变。战前，在像这样的一个午餐聚会上，人们所说的事与现在完全一样，但是听起来却不同，因为那个时候的谈话被一种嗡嗡声伴随着，这种嗡嗡声不清晰，但是悦耳、刺激，这改变了话语本身的价值。可不可以用文字表达出那种嗡嗡声呢？或许在诗人的帮助下可以……我身边摆放着一本书，我翻开它，很不经意地翻到了丁尼生。在这儿我发现丁尼生唱道：","If by good luck there had been an ash-tray handy, if one had not knocked the ash out of the window in default, if things had been a little different from what they were, one would not have seen, presumably, a cat without a tail.The sight of that abrupt and truncated animal padding softly across the quadrangle changed by some fluke of the subconscious intelligence the emotional light for me.It was as if someone had let fall a shade.Perhaps the excellent hock was relinquishing its hold.Certainly, as I watched the Manx cat pause in the middle of the lawn as if it too questioned the universe, something seemed lacking, something seemed different.But what was lacking, what was different, I asked myself, listening to the talk?And to answer that question I had to think myself out of the room, back into the past, before the war indeed, and to set before my eyes the model of another luncheon party held in rooms not very far distant from these; but different.Everything was different.Meanwhile the talk went on among the guests, who were many and young, some of this sex, some of that; it went on swimmingly, it went on agreeably, freely, amusingly.And as it went on I set it against the background of that other talk, and as I matched the two together I had no doubt that one was the descendant, the legitimate heir of the other.Nothing was changed; nothing was different save only here I listened with all my ears not entirely to what was being said, but to the murmur or current behind it.Yes, that was it—the change was there.Before the war at a luncheon party like this people would have said precisely the same things but they would have sounded different, because in those days they were accompanied by a sort of humming noise, not articulate, but musical, exciting, which changed the value of the words themselves.Could one set that humming noise to words?Perhaps with the help of the poets one could.... A book lay beside me and, opening it, I turned casually enough to Tennyson.And here I found Tennyson was singing:"

"想起战前人们在午餐聚会上甚至压低嗓音吟哦这些东西，就有了滑稽之处，于是我大笑起来，还要指着那个马恩岛猫，作为我大笑的理由。可怜的小东西没有尾巴，站在草地中间，看起来的确有点滑稽。它真的生来就如此吗？还是在一场事故中失去了它的尾巴？尽管有些人说马恩岛上有没有尾巴的猫，但这些猫要比人们想象的罕见。它是一种奇怪的动物，与其说是漂亮，不如说是有趣。一条尾巴能带来如此大的差别，这很奇怪——你知道，当午餐聚会结束，人们找他们的大衣和帽子时，才会说这样的话。","There was something so ludicrous in thinking of people humming such things even under their breath at luncheon parties before the war that I burst out laughing  and had to explain my laughter by pointing at the Manx cat, who did look a little absurd, poor beast, without a tail, in the middle of the lawn.Was he really born so, or had he lost his tail in an accident?The tailless cat, though some are said to exist in the Isle of Man, is rarer than one thinks.It is a queer animal, quaint rather than beautiful.It is strange what a difference a tail makes—you know the sort of things one says as a lunch party breaks up and people are finding their coats and hats."
"由于主人的热情款待，这顿午餐一直持续到下午很晚的时候。那个美丽的十月天渐渐地暗了下来。当我走过林阴道的时候，树上的叶子正在飘落。一扇一扇大门似乎在我身后轻轻地而又断然地关闭了。无数的教区执事把数不清的钥匙插到很好用的门锁里；这座宝库又将安全地度过一个夜晚。走过林阴道之后，便是一条马路——它的名字我忘记了——如果向右转，顺着这条马路就可到达弗恩汉姆。但是还有很多时间。晚餐要到七点半才开始。不过吃过这样一顿午餐后，人们几乎可以不用吃晚餐。很奇怪，一小段诗映入脑海，使得双腿和着它的节拍沿路前行。这些话——","This one, thanks to the hospitality of the host, had lasted far into the afternoon.The beautiful October day was fading and the leaves were falling from the trees in the avenue as I walked through it.Gate after gate seemed to close with gentle finality behind me. Innumerable beadles were fitting innumerable keys into well-oiled locks; the treasure-house was being made secure for another night.After the avenue one comes out upon a road—I forget its name—which leads you, if you take the right turning, along to Fernham.But there was plenty of time.Dinner was not till half-past seven.One could almost do without dinner after such a luncheon.It is strange how a scrap of poetry works in the mind and makes the legs move in time to it along the road.Those words—"

"当我快步走向赫丁利时，它们在我的血液中歌唱。然后转到另外一个音步，在拦河坝搅动着河水的地方，我唱道：","sang in my blood as I stepped quickly along towards Headingley.And then, switching off into the other measure, I sang, where the waters are churned up by the weir:"

"它的巢筑在一根被弄湿的嫩枝上；","Whose nest is in a water’d shoot;"

"我大声地喊着，就像人们在薄暮中大喊一样：多么伟大的诗人，他们是多么伟大的诗人啊！","What poets, I cried aloud, as one does in the dusk, what poets they were!"
"我想，我是带着一种对我们所处的时代的妒忌情绪，进而想知道是否有人能够诚实地说出两位还在世的诗人的名字，他们像丁尼生和克里斯蒂娜·罗塞蒂那样伟大，尽管这样的比较是愚蠢和荒唐的。看着泛着泡沫的河水，我想，把他们进行对比很显然是不可能的。那首诗之所以让人们如此放纵、如此狂喜，是因为它赞扬了人们过去（或许是在战前的午餐聚会的时候）常常有的某种情感，因此人们可以很容易、很熟悉地作出反应，而不用费事去检查那些情感，或者拿它与他们现在有的任何一种情感作比较。然而还在世的诗人所表达的情感，事实上是此刻正在被制造出来、从我们身上夺去的情感。一开始，人们没有认出这种情感，而且常常因为某种原因害怕它。人们充满渴望地看着它，又带着猜疑和妒忌的情绪拿它和他们所知道的旧情感作比较。由此便产生了现代诗歌的困难，同时也正因为这个困难，对于任何一个优秀的现代诗人，人们最多只能记住他的连续两行诗歌。因为这个原因——我记忆力的衰退，这场争论由于资料的匮乏而显得枯燥乏味。但是，当我继续往赫丁利走的时候，我想道，为什么在午餐聚会上我们停止了低声吟哦？为什么艾尔弗雷德停止了歌唱：","In a sort of jealousy, I suppose, for our own age, silly and absurd though these comparisons are, I went on to wonder if honestly one could name two living poets now as great as Tennyson and Christina Rossetti were then.Obviously it is impossible, I thought, looking into those foaming waters, to compare them.The very reason why that poetry excites one to such abandonment, such rapture, is that it celebrates some feeling that one used to have (at luncheon parties before the war perhaps), so that one responds easily, familiarly, without troubling to check the feeling, or to compare it with any that one has now.But the living poets express a feeling that is actually being made and torn out of us at the moment.One does not recognize it in the first place; often for some reason one fears it; one watches it with keenness and compares it jealously and suspiciously with the old feeling that one knew.Hence the difficulty of modern poetry; and it is because of this difficulty that one cannot remember more than two consecutive lines of any good modern poet.For this reason—that my memory failed me—the argument flagged for want of material.But why, I continued, moving on towards Headingley, have we stopped humming under our breath at luncheon parties?Why has Alfred ceased to sing"

"我们是不是应该责怪战争呢？一九一四年八月枪声响起的时候，是不是男人女人的脸上都在彼此的眼中清晰地显示，浪漫被扼杀了？借着炮火的光亮看统治者的脸的确是令人惊愕的（特别是对女人来说，因为她们对教育仍抱有幻想等等）。他们看起来如此丑陋——无论德国的、英国的，还是法国的——都是如此愚蠢。但是无论抱怨什么，不管抱怨谁，如今唤起丁尼生和克里斯蒂娜·罗塞蒂的灵感，让他们为即将到来的爱人热情歌唱的幻觉要比当时少得多。人们现在只需要去阅读、观察、聆听和记忆。但为什么要“怨”呢？如果它是一种幻觉，为什么不去赞扬那种毁灭了幻觉并且用真实取而代之的灾难呢，无论是什么灾难？因为真实……这些点标志着我在寻找真实的过程中忘记转弯去弗恩汉姆的地方。是的，的确，哪个是真实，哪个是幻觉？我问自己。比如说，什么是关于这些房子的真实呢？薄暮时分它们看着很朦胧，红窗户显出了节日气氛；但是早上九点钟的时候，糖果、鞋带又使它们看上去通红，而且粗俗、污秽。柳树、河流，还有一直延伸到河边的花园，在薄雾静悄悄的笼罩下都是模糊的，但是在阳光下却是红彤彤、金光闪闪的——关于它们，哪些是真实，哪些又是幻觉呢？我不必告诉你们我思想的曲折变化，因为去赫丁利的路上我并没有得出结论。你们可以猜想，我很快就发现自己忘记转弯了，于是又往回走，再到弗恩汉姆去。","Shall we lay the blame on the war?When the guns fired in August 1914, did the faces of men and women show so plain in each other’s eyes that romance was killed?Certainly it was a shock (to women in particular with their illusions about education, and so on) to see the faces of our rulers in the light of the shell-fire.So ugly they looked—German, English, French—so stupid.But lay the blame where one will, on whom one will, the illusion which inspired Tennyson and Christina Rossetti to sing so passionately about the coming of their loves is far rarer now than then.One has only to read, to look, to listen, to remember.But why say ‘blame’?Why, if it was an illusion, not praise the catastrophe, whatever it was, that destroyed illusion and put truth in its place?For truth... those dots mark the spot where, in search of truth, I missed the turning up to Fernham.Yes indeed, which was truth and which was illusion?I asked myself.What was the truth about these houses, for example, dim and festive now with their red windows in the dusk, but raw and red and squalid, with their sweets and their bootlaces, at nine o’clock in the morning?And the willows and the river and the gardens that run down to the river, vague now with the mist stealing over them, but gold and red in the sunlight—which was the truth, which was the illusion about them?I spare you the twists and turns of my cogitations, for no conclusion was found on the road to Headingley, and I ask You to suppose that I soon found out my mistake about the turning and retraced my steps to Fernham."
"既然我已经说过那是十月的一天，我就不敢改变季节并描述花园墙头上悬垂的丁香花、番红花、郁金香以及其他春天的花朵，从而失去你们的尊重并危及小说这个好听的名字。小说必须忠于事实，事实越真实，小说就越好——别人是这样告诉我们的。因此仍旧是秋天，树叶仍旧是黄色的并且不断飘落。如果说有任何变化的话，那就是比以前落得更快了，因为现在已经是傍晚了（确切地说是七点二十三分），而且一阵微风（确切地说是西南风）刮了起来。但是尽管如此，总有一些怪东西在起作用：","As I have said already that it was an October day, I dare not forfeit your respect and imperil the fair name of fiction by changing the season and describing lilacs hanging over garden walls, crocuses, tulips and other flowers of spring.Fiction must stick to facts, and the truer the facts the better the fiction—so we are told.Therefore it was still autumn and the leaves were still yellow and falling, if anything, a little faster than before, because it was now evening (seven twenty-three to be precise) and a breeze (from the south-west to be exact) had risen.But for all that there was something odd at work:"

"它的巢筑在一根被弄湿的嫩枝上；","Whose nest is in a water’d shoot;"
"我的心像一颗苹果树，","My heart is like an apple tree"
"它的树枝被密密麻麻的果实压弯……","Whose boughs are bent with thick-set fruit…"
"也许克里斯蒂娜·罗塞蒂的诗句要对幻想的愚蠢行为负一定的责任——它当然仅仅只是幻想，幻想着丁香花在花园的墙头上摇摆它的花朵，黄粉蝶到处疾飞，花粉在空气中弥散。一阵风吹过来，我不知道是从哪个方向吹来的，刮起了还未长成的嫩叶，因此空中闪着银灰色。这是傍晚时分，各种颜色逐渐变深，紫色和金黄色在窗玻璃上燃烧，像一颗容易激动的心在跳动。这时，因为某种原因世界的美丽都呈现出来了，但是也很快消失了（这时我走进了花园，因为门很不谨慎地开着，而且附近似乎没有教区执事）。世界的美很快就会消失，它有两个刀口，一个是欢笑的，一个是痛苦的，把心切成了两部分。在春天的暮色中，弗恩汉姆的花园展现在我面前，荒芜而又开阔。高高的青草中疏落、随意地点缀着水仙花和蓝铃花，大概在花开得最盛时候也是没有秩序吧，现在被风吹得四处摇摆，用力拽着它们的根部。这些建筑的窗户呈弧形，就像在红砖的海洋中船的窗户一样。在很快飘过的春天的云朵下，这些窗户从柠檬色变成了银色。有人躺在吊床上；有人跑过草地，不过在这种光线里，他们仅仅是鬼魂，一半是我的猜想，一半是我看见的——难道没有人拉住她？然后在阳台上，走来一个佝偻的身影，好像是突然走出来呼吸些空气，看一看花园，她令人畏惧却又很谦恭。从她宽阔的前额和破旧的衣服来看，会不会是那个著名的学者，会不会就是J——H——本人？所有的一切都是朦胧的，但是也很强烈，就像是薄暮披在花园上的围巾被星星或刀剑给割成了数部分——某种可怕现实的切口以它自己的方式由春天的心里跳出来。因为青春——","perhaps the words of Christina Rossetti were partly responsible for the folly of the fancy—it was nothing of course but a fancy—that the lilac was shaking its flowers over the garden walls, and the brimstone butterflies were scudding hither and thither, and the dust of the pollen was in the air.A wind blew, from what quarter I know not, but it lifted the half-grown leaves so that there was a flash of silver grey in the air.It was the time between the lights when colours undergo their intensification and purples and golds burn in window-panes like the beat of an excitable heart; when for some reason the beauty of the world revealed and yet soon to perish (here I pushed into the garden, for, unwisely, the door was left open and no beadles seemed about), the beauty of the world which is so soon to perish, has two edges, one of laughter, one of anguish, cutting the heart asunder.The gardens of Fernham lay before me in the spring twilight, wild and open, and in the long grass, sprinkled and carelessly flung, were daffodils and bluebells, not orderly perhaps at the best of times, and now wind-blown and waving as they tugged at their roots.The windows of the building, curved like ships’ windows among generous waves of red brick, changed from lemon to silver under the flight of the quick spring clouds.Somebody was in a hammock, somebody, but in this light they were phantoms only, half guessed, half seen, raced across the grass—would no one stop her?—and then on the terrace, as if popping out to breathe the air, to glance at the garden, came a bent figure, formidable yet humble, with her great forehead and her shabby dress—could it be the famous scholar, could it be J—H—herself?All was dim, yet intense too, as if the scarf which the dusk had flung over the garden were torn asunder by star or sword—the gash of some terrible reality leaping, as its way is, out of the heart of the spring.For youth—"
"我的汤来了。有人正把晚饭端到大饭厅里。离春天还很远，事实上，它只是十月的一个晚上。大家都聚集在大饭厅里。晚饭已经准备好了。这是汤。一碗平淡无奇的肉汤。里面没有什么东西可以引发幻想。透过透明的汤，人们可以看到盘子自身可能带有的任何图案。但是没有图案。盘子上没有装饰。接下来是牛肉，一起上来的还有青菜和土豆——很普通的三合一，使人想到泥泞的菜市场里牛的臀部，边缘卷起并且发黄了的嫩芽，讨价还价和降价出售，以及星期一早上拿着网袋的女人。鉴于供给很充足，而且煤矿工人无疑吃得更少，所以没有理由抱怨我们的日常食物。接下来上的是李子和蛋奶糕。如果有人抱怨说，即使有蛋奶糕来缓和一下，李子仍然是一种不慈悲的蔬菜（它们根本不是水果），李子是多筋的，就像一个守财奴的心一样，而且渗出的液体就像是守财奴的静脉里流动的液体一样，他们在八十年中舍不得喝酒，舍不得穿暖而且也不施舍穷人，如果有人这样抱怨，那么他就该想一想，有些人的慈善慷慨也不过就相当于李子而已。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　再接下来的是饼干和奶酪，这时水罐子被随意地传来传去，因为饼干的本性就是干的，并且这些是地地道道的饼干。这就是全部。一顿饭就结束了。每个人都擦着地板把椅子推到后面，双开式弹簧门前前后后地猛烈摆动。很快，饭厅里便没有了食物的痕迹，无疑是为第二天的早饭作准备。沿着走廊，爬上楼梯，英国的青年边奔边唱。一位客人，一个陌生人（因为我在弗恩汉姆享有的权力和我在特里尼蒂、萨默维尔、戈廷、纽纳姆或是克赖斯特彻奇享有的权力一样多）能否说“晚饭不好”，或者说（玛丽·西顿和我现在在她的起居室里）：“我们本来不能单独在这里吃饭吗？”如果我说了这样的话，那就是在窥探、调查这个家庭秘密的经济状况了。在生人眼里，这个家庭还穿着欢快和勇敢的漂亮外衣。不，我不能说这种话。的确，谈话一时间变得索然无味了。人的精神状态就是这样，心脏、躯干、大脑都混在一起，而不是装在分开的空间里，无疑一百万年之后它们肯定会分开，因此一顿好的晚餐对于一场好的谈话非常重要。如果一个人没有吃好，他便不能好好地思考，好好地恋爱，好好地睡觉。脊椎里的那盏灯用牛肉和李子是点不着的。我们大概都要进天堂，并且希望范戴克在下一个街角遇到我们——那是一种含糊且合格的心理状态，是一天工作结束后，牛肉和李子在它们之间产生的一种状态。很高兴我的一位教科学的朋友有一个橱子，里面有一个矮胖的瓶子和一些小玻璃杯——（不过应该先有鳎鱼和山鹑）——因此我们能够靠到炉火旁边，补救一天的生活所带来的一些损害。大约一分钟之后，我们自由地围绕着那些奇特而又有趣的东西谈来谈去，那些东西都是一个特定的人不在场时在脑子里形成的，等再次聚会时自然又要讨论一番——某人怎么结婚了，某人怎么没结婚；一个人这么想，另一个人那么想；一个人通过各种知识得到了提升，另一个人很惊人地变坏了——还有对人性、对我们所居住的这个令人惊奇的世界的性质的思考，这些思考是那些谈话很自然的结果。然而，当谈到这些事情的时候，我很羞愧地意识到，有一股潮流很主动地涌出来，并把每件事都引到它自己的目的中去。人们可能会谈论西班牙或葡萄牙，谈论读书或赛马，但不论说什么，那些都不是真正的兴趣所在，真正的兴趣在于约五个世纪前泥瓦匠们在一个高高的屋顶上的情景。皇帝和贵族们用大麻袋把钱财带来，并把它倒进土里。这个情景总是很生动地进入我的脑海并且和另一个场景挨着，那些瘦的牛、泥泞的市场、枯萎的青菜，还有老人多筋的心脏——这两个画面完全不连贯、不相关，而且荒唐可笑，但又总是一起出现，互相争斗，而且使我完全任由它们摆布。如果不想使整个谈话被曲解，那么最好的办法就是把我的想法暴露在空气中，如果能交上好运，它就会枯萎破碎，像人们在温莎打开死皇帝的棺材时他的头颅一样。我很简短地告诉玛丽·西顿——那些年来泥瓦匠们一直在教堂顶上，皇帝、皇后和贵族们扛着用大麻袋装着的金银财宝并把它们铲进土里；然后我们自己时代的那些金融巨头来了，我猜测，他们把支票、债券放到了以前别人存放金锭和粗制金块的地方。我说过，所有那些都埋在学院的地底下；但是这个学院，我们现在坐着的地方，在其堂皇的红砖下面，在花园凌乱的野草下面，埋着些什么呢？在我们吃饭用的那种朴实的瓷器后面，还有（我还没来得及阻止，这些话就已经从我嘴里跳出来了）在牛肉、蛋奶糕以及李子后面，有些什么力量呢？","Here was my soup. Dinner was being served in the great dining-hall.Far from being spring it was in fact an evening in October.Everybody was assembled in the big dining-room.Dinner was ready.Here was the soup.It was a plain gravy soup. There was nothing to stir the fancy in that.One could have seen through the transparent liquid any pattern that there might have been on the plate itself.But there was no pattern.The plate was plain.Next came beef with its attendant greens and potatoes—a homely trinity, suggesting the rumps of cattle in a muddy market, and sprouts curled and yellowed at the edge, and bargaining and cheapening and women with string bags on Monday morning.There was no reason to complain of human nature’s daily food, seeing that the supply was sufficient and coal-miners doubtless were sitting down to less.Prunes and custard followed.And if anyone complains that prunes, even when mitigated by custard, are an uncharitable vegetable (fruit they are not), stringy as a miser’s heart and exuding a fluid such as might run in misers’ veins who have denied themselves wine and warmth for eighty years and yet not given to the poor, he should reflect that there are people whose charity embraces even the prune.Biscuits and cheese came next, and here the water-jug was liberally passed round, for it is the nature of biscuits to be dry, and these were biscuits to the core.That was all.The meal was over.Everybody scraped their chairs back; the swing-doors swung violently to and fro; soon the hall was emptied of every sign of food and made ready no doubt for breakfast next morning.Down corridors and up staircases the youth of England went banging and singing.And was it for a guest, a stranger (for I had no more right here in Fernham than in Trinity or Somerville or Girton or Newnham or Christchurch), to say, ‘The dinner was not good,’or to say (we were now, Mary Seton and I, in her sitting-room), ‘Could we not have dined up here alone?’ for if I had said anything of the kind I should have been prying and searching into the secret economies of a house which to the stranger wears so fine a front of gaiety and courage.No, one could say nothing of the sort.Indeed, conversation for a moment flagged.The human frame being what it is, heart, body and brain all mixed together, and not contained in separate compartments as they will be no doubt in another million years, a good dinner is of great importance to good talk.One cannot think well, love well, sleep well, if one has not dined well.The lamp in the spine does not light on beef and prunes.We are all PROBABLY going to heaven, and Vandyck is, we HOPE, to meet us round the next corner—that is the dubious and qualifying state of mind that beef and prunes at the end of the day’s work breed between them.Happily my friend, who taught science, had a cupboard where there was a squat bottle and little glasses—(but there should have been sole and partridge to begin with)—so that we were able to draw up to the fire and repair some of the damages of the day’s living.In a minute or so we were slipping freely in and out among all those objects of curiosity and interest which form in the mind in the absence of a particular person, and are naturally to be discussed on coming together again—how somebody has married, another has not; one thinks this, another that; one has improved out of all knowledge, the other most amazingly gone to the bad—with all those speculations upon human nature and the character of the amazing world we live in which spring naturally from such beginnings.While these things were being said, however, I became shamefacedly aware of a current setting in of its own accord and carrying everything forward to an end of its own.One might be talking of Spain or Portugal, of book or racehorse, but the real interest of whatever was said was none of those things, but a scene of masons on a high roof some five centuries ago. Kings and nobles brought treasure in huge sacks and poured it under the earth.This scene was for ever coming alive in my mind and placing itself by another of lean cows and a muddy market and withered greens and the stringy hearts of old men—these two pictures, disjointed and disconnected and nonsensical as they were, were for ever coming together and combating each other and had me entirely at their mercy.The best course, unless the whole talk was to be distorted, was to expose what was in my mind to the air, when with good luck it would fade and crumble like the head of the dead king when they opened the coffin at Windsor.Briefly, then, I told Miss Seton about the masons who had been all those years on the roof of the chapel, and about the kings and queens and nobles bearing sacks of gold and silver on their shoulders, which they shovelled into the earth; and then how the great financial magnates of our own time came and laid cheques and bonds, I suppose, where the others had laid ingots and rough lumps of gold.All that lies beneath the colleges down there, I said; but this college, where we are now sitting, what lies beneath its gallant red brick and the wild unkempt grasses of the garden?What force is behind that plain china off which we dined, and (here it popped out of my mouth before I could stop it) the beef, the custard and the prunes?"
"玛丽·西顿说，大约一八六〇年的时候——但是你知道这个故事，她说，我猜她是对叙述感到厌烦。她告诉我——租了房子。委员会开了会。信封上写好了姓名地址。通告也写出来了。开了会，读了信，某某人许诺了这么多，相反，某某先生一个便士也不给。《星期六评论》一直很无礼。我们怎样才能够筹集到租办公室的钱呢？要不要举行一次义卖呢？难道我们找不到一个好看的女孩坐在前排吗？让我们看看约翰·斯图尔特·穆勒对这件事情说些什么。有没有人可以劝说某某报纸的主编刊登一封信呢？我们能不能请某夫人在信上签名呢？某某夫人不在城里。这大概就是六十年前这件事的处理方式，它需要巨大的努力，而且消耗了大量时间。只是经过一段长时间的挣扎和极端的困难之后，她们才一共募得了三万英镑。[1]所以很明显我们不能喝酒、吃山鹑，不能雇用头顶着锡盘子的仆人，她说。我们不能买沙发，不能拥有独立的房间。她引用了某本书的一句话，说道：“那些便利设施，不得不再等等。”[2]","Well, said Mary Seton, about the year 1860—Oh, but you know the story, she said, bored, I suppose, by the recital.And she told me—rooms were hired.Committees met.Envelopes were addressed.Circulars were drawn up.Meetings were held; letters were read out; so-and-so has promised so much; on the contrary, Mr—won’t give a penny.The SATURDAY REVIEW has been very rude.How can we raise a fund to pay for offices?Shall we hold a bazaar?Can’t we find a pretty girl to sit in the front row?Let us look up what John Stuart Mill said on the subject.Can anyone persuade the editor of the—to print a letter?Can we get Lady—to sign it?Lady — is out of town.That was the way it was done, presumably, sixty years ago, and it was a prodigious effort, and a great deal of time was spent on it.And it was only after a long struggle and with the utmost difficulty that they got thirty thousand pounds together.[1]So obviously we cannot have wine and partridges and servants carrying tin dishes on their heads, she said.We cannot have sofas and separate rooms.‘The amenities,’ she said, quoting from some book or other, ‘will have to wait.’[2]"
"那些年复一年工作的妇女想要积累两千英镑都那么困难，而她们用尽了力气才获得了三万英镑，想到这个，我们突然鄙视起我们女人的应受指摘的穷苦。我们的母亲一直在做些什么，都没能给我们留下任何财富？往她们的鼻子上擦粉？透过商店的橱窗往里看？在蒙特卡洛的阳光下招摇？在壁炉架上有几张照片。玛丽的母亲——如果那是她的相片——在闲余时间可能是个挥霍无度的人（她和教堂的一个牧师生了十三个孩子）。但是如果是这样的话，她放荡淫靡的生活并没有在她的脸上留下什么享乐的痕迹。她只是一个很平常的女人，一位披着彩格呢披肩的老太太，披肩用一块大大的多彩浮雕玉石扣住。她坐在柳条椅上，鼓励一只小狗看照相机，脸上带着一种既觉得有趣但又很紧张的神情，因为她知道，按下快门的时候，小狗肯定要动。假如当时她做了生意，或是成了人工丝绸的制造商或者证券交易所的巨头；假如她给弗恩汉姆留下了二三十万英镑，那么我们今晚就可以很舒服地坐着，我们谈话的主题可能就会是考古学、植物学、人类学、物理学、原子的性质、数学、天文学、相对论、地理学。要是西顿夫人，她的母亲，她母亲的母亲学过赚钱的大本领并且留下她们的钱，就像她们的父亲和祖父们一样，来设立专门为女性享用的研究员基金、讲师基金、奖金和奖学金，那该有多好啊！我们也许可以单独在这里很舒服地享用一只禽鸟和一瓶酒。我们也许可以带着不算过分的自信，期望在别人慷慨捐助的职业的庇护下度过愉快而又体面的一生。我们也许可以探险或者写作；或是在世界上受人尊敬的地方悠闲地消磨时日；坐在帕提侬神庙前的台阶上冥想；或是十点到办公室，四点半时舒舒服服地回家写上一首小诗。只是，如果西顿夫人和像她一样的人从十五岁就开始做生意，那就不会有玛丽了——这就是我这篇议论麻烦的地方。我问，玛丽对此怎么想呢？在窗帘之间是十月的夜空，安静而可爱，一两颗星星挂在正在变黄的树上。玛丽会不会为了弗恩汉姆可能得到的一笔五万英镑左右的捐款（这只需钢笔写一画）而准备放弃她的那份秋夜，放弃她的记忆（这个家庭纵然很大，但曾经很幸福）呢？那些在苏格兰游戏和争吵的记忆，而她对苏格兰的新鲜空气和美味糕饼永远都赞不绝口。因为捐助一所大学，必须要对子女进行压制。发了一笔大财同时还生养十三个孩子——没人能受得了。想想事实吧，我们说。首先，婴儿需要九个月才会出生。然后婴儿出生。接着得花费三四个月的时间来喂养婴儿。给婴儿哺乳之后，当然要花费五年的时间陪小孩玩。似乎不应该让孩子们在街上乱跑。曾经有人在俄国看到孩子撒野乱跑，他们就说这种情景令人很不愉快。人们也说，人性是在一至五岁期间形成的。我说，如果西顿夫人一直都在忙于赚钱，那么你对游戏和争吵会留有什么样的记忆呢？对苏格兰，那里的新鲜空气和糕饼，还有其他关于它的事情，你会知道什么呢？问这些问题是没用的，因为你根本就不会存在。而且，如果西顿夫人、她的母亲以及她母亲的母亲，积累了大量财富放在学院和图书馆的地基下面，会发生什么事？问这样的问题也是一样白问，因为第一，对她们来说，挣钱是不可能的；第二，就算可能，法律也会否定她们拥有自己所挣钱财的权利。只是在最近的四十八年以来，西顿夫人才拥有了属于她自己的一个便士。在那之前的所有世纪里，这个便士都会是她丈夫的财产——这个想法可能是西顿夫人、她的母亲、外祖母等不去证券交易所的理由之一。她们可能会说，我赚的每一个便士都被拿走，并按照我丈夫的想法使用——也许会在巴利奥尔或者国王学院设立奖学金或者捐赠研究员基金，因此即使我能赚钱，我对赚钱也没有多大兴趣。我最好还是让我丈夫去赚钱吧。","At the thought of all those women working year after year and finding it hard to get two thousand pounds together, and as much as they could do to get thirty thousand pounds, we burst out in scorn at the reprehensible poverty of our sex.What had our mothers been doing then that they had no wealth to leave us?Powdering their noses?Looking in at shop windows?Flaunting in the sun at Monte Carlo?There were some photographs on the mantelpiece.Mary’s mother—if that was her picture—may have been a wastrel in her spare time (she had thirteen children by a minister of the church), but if so her gay and dissipated life had left too few traces of its pleasures on her face.She was a homely body; an old lady in a plaid shawl which was fastened by a large cameo; and she sat in a basket-chair, encouraging a spaniel to look at the camera, with the amused, yet strained expression of one who is sure that the dog will move directly the bulb is pressed.Now if she had gone into business; had become a manufacturer of artificial silk or a magnate on the Stock Exchange; if she had left two or three hundred thousand pounds to Fernham, we could have been sitting at our ease tonight and the subject of our talk might have been archaeology, botany, anthropology, physics, the nature of the atom, mathematics, astronomy, relativity, geography.If only Mrs Seton and her mother and her mother before her had learnt the great art of making money and had left their money, like their fathers and their grandfathers before them, to found fellowships and lectureships and prizes and scholarships appropriated to the use of their own sex, we might have dined very tolerably up here alone off a bird and a bottle of wine; we might have looked forward without undue confidence to a pleasant and honourable lifetime spent in the shelter of one of the liberally endowed professions.We might have been exploring or writing; mooning about the venerable places of the earth; sitting contemplative on the steps of the Parthenon, or going at ten to an office and coming home comfortably at half-past four to write a little poetry.Only, if Mrs Seton and her like had gone into business at the age of fifteen, there would have been—that was the snag in the argument—no Mary.What, I asked, did Mary think of that?There between the curtains was the October night, calm and lovely, with a star or two caught in the yellowing trees.Was she ready to resign her share of it and her memories (for they had been a happy family, though a large one) of games and quarrels up in Scotland, which she is never tired of praising for the fineness of its air and the quality of its cakes, in order that Fernham might have been endowed with fifty thousand pounds or so by a stroke of the pen?For, to endow a college would necessitate the suppression of families altogether.Making a fortune and bearing thirteen children—no human being could stand it.Consider the facts, we said.First there are nine months before the baby is born. Then the baby is born. Then there are three or four months spent in feeding the baby.After the baby is fed there are certainly five years spent in playing with the baby.You cannot, it seems, let children run about the streets.People who have seen them running wild in Russia say that the sight is not a pleasant one.People say, too, that human nature takes its shape in the years between one and five.If Mrs Seton, I said, had been making money, what sort of memories would you have had of games and quarrels?What would you have known of Scotland, and its fine air and cakes and all the rest of it?But it is useless to ask these questions, because you would never have come into existence at all.Moreover, it is equally useless to ask what might have happened if Mrs Seton and her mother and her mother before her had amassed great wealth and laid it under the foundations of college and library, because, in the first place, to earn money was impossible for them, and in the second, had it been possible, the law denied them the right to possess what money they earned.It is only for the last forty-eight years that Mrs Seton has had a penny of her own.For all the centuries before that it would have been her husband’s property—a thought which, perhaps, may have had its share in keeping Mrs Seton and her mothers off the Stock Exchange.Every penny I earn, they may have said, will be taken from me and disposed of according to my husband’s wisdom—perhaps to found a scholarship or to endow a fellowship in Balliol or Kings, so that to earn money, even if I could earn money, is not a matter that interests me very greatly.I had better leave it to my husband."
"无论如何，不管是否该归罪于那位看着小狗的老太太，毫无疑问，由于某种原因，我们的母亲们把她们的事情处理得十分不当。一个便士都不能用在“便利设施”上，不能用在山鹑和酒、教区执事和草皮、书和雪茄、图书馆和休闲活动上。她们最多就只能用毫无装饰的泥土砌成毫无装饰的墙。","At any rate, whether or not the blame rested on the old lady who was looking at the spaniel, there could be no doubt that for some reason or other our mothers had mismanaged their affairs very gravely.Not a penny could be spared for ‘amenities’; for partridges and wine, beadles and turf, books and cigars, libraries and leisure.To raise bare walls out of bare earth was the utmost they could do."
"我们就这样站在窗边谈着，像成千上万的人每晚都在往下看一样，俯视着我们下面那座著名的城市的圆屋顶和塔楼。在秋天的月光之下，这座城市非常美丽，非常神秘。古老的石头看上去非常地洁白，非常地神圣庄严。人们会想到收集在那下面的书籍；想到了年长的高级教士和名人的画像，它们挂在镶了壁板的屋子里；想到那些能会在人行道上投下奇怪的球形和月牙形影子的彩色窗户；想到那些匾额、纪念碑和碑文；想到喷水池和青草；想到对着静谧的四方院的那些安静的房间。而且（请原谅我的想法）我也想到值得赞美的烟、饮料以及深深的扶手椅，还有舒适的地毯，想到温文尔雅、和蔼和高贵，它们是奢侈、独处和空间的产物。当然我们的母亲们没有给我们任何可以和这些相比的东西——我们的母亲们积聚三万英镑都是困难的，我们的母亲们为圣安德鲁斯的牧师们生了十三个孩子。","So we talked standing at the window and looking, as so many thousands look every night, down on the domes and towers of the famous city beneath us.It was very beautiful, very mysterious in the autumn moonlight.The old stone looked very white and venerable.One thought of all the books that were assembled down there; of the pictures of old prelates and worthies hanging in the panelled rooms; of the painted windows that would be throwing strange globes and crescents on the pavement; of the tablets and memorials and inscriptions; of the fountains and the grass; of the quiet rooms looking across the quiet quadrangles.And (pardon me the thought) I thought, too, of the admirable smoke and drink and the deep armchairs and the pleasant carpets; of the urbanity, the geniality, the dignity which are the offspring of luxury and privacy and space.Certainly our mothers had not provided us with anything comparable to all this—our mothers who found it difficult to scrape together thirty thousand pounds, our mothers who bore thirteen children to ministers of religion at St Andrews."
"因此我回到了我的小旅馆去，在走过那些黑暗的街道时，我想想这，想想那，就像一个人结束一天的工作时那样。　我想着，西顿夫人为什么没有钱留给我们；穷困对脑子有什么影响；财富对脑子有什么影响；我想起那天早上看见的肩上镶着一簇簇绒毛的奇怪的老绅士们；我记起，如果有人吹口哨，他们中间的一个人就会跑；想起教堂中风琴发出的低沉的回响和图书馆关闭的大门；我想到被锁在门外是多么地不痛快；我又想到被锁在里头也许更糟；我还想到一种性别的人的安全和富足，以及另一性别的人的贫困和不安全；想起传统和缺乏传统分别对一位作家的脑子有什么影响；最后我想，该是时候把这一天弄皱的皮，连着它的议论、印象、怒气和欢乐，一起卷起来抛到树篱里去。上千颗星星在空阔的蓝色天空中闪过。人仿佛独自呆在一个不可捉摸的社会里。人们都睡着了——俯卧着、平躺着、安静无声。牛津剑桥的街上一个人都没有。甚至旅馆的大门都是由于一只无形的手的触摸而弹开的——旅馆里没有一个杂役等我回来，为我照明、送我回屋，夜是那样地深了。","So I went back to my inn, and as I walked through the dark streets I pondered this and that, as one does at the end of the day’s work.I pondered why it was that Mrs Seton had no money to leave us; and what effect poverty has on the mind; and what effect wealth has on the mind; and I thought of the queer old gentlemen I had seen that morning with tufts of fur upon their shoulders; and I remembered how if one whistled one of them ran; and I thought of the organ booming in the chapel and of the shut doors of the library; and I thought how unpleasant it is to be locked out; and I thought how it is worse perhaps to be locked in; and, thinking of the safety and prosperity of the one sex and of the poverty and insecurity of the other and of the effect of tradition and of the lack of tradition upon the mind of a writer, I thought at last that it was time to roll up the crumpled skin of the day, with its arguments and its impressions and its anger and its laughter, and cast it into the hedge.A thousand stars were flashing across the blue wastes of the sky. One seemed alone with an inscrutable society.All human beings were laid asleep—prone, horizontal, dumb.Nobody seemed stirring in the streets of Oxbridge.Even the door of the hotel sprang open at the touch of an invisible hand—not a boots was sitting up to light me to bed, it was so late."
"第二章","CHAPTER TWO"
"如果我可以要求你们跟随我的话，现在这个场景改变了。树叶还在飘落，不过现在是在伦敦，而不是在牛津剑桥，并且我必须请你们想像一个房间，这个房间像成千上万的其他房间一样有一扇窗户，隔着人的帽子、货车以及汽车，可以望见别的窗户。房间里的桌子上有一张白纸，上面写着几个大字“女人和小说”，其余什么都没有。不幸的是，在牛津剑桥吃过午饭和晚饭后，似乎不可避免地要去造访大英博物馆。人们必须要把这些印象里私人的、偶然的东西过滤出去，以此得到纯净的液体——真理的精油。因为那次在牛津剑桥的访问以及午餐和晚餐引发了一大堆的问题。为什么男人喝酒，而女人喝水呢？为什么这一性别的人这么富足，而那一性别的人那么贫穷呢？贫穷对小说有什么影响呢？艺术品的创造需要什么条件呢？——上千个问题立刻全冒出来了。不过，人们需要的是答案而不是问题。找到答案的唯一办法就是，去请教有学问、不带偏见的人，这些人超脱了口舌的争辩、肉体的困惑，并把他们推理和研究的结果发表在大英博物馆的书中。我拿起一本笔记本和一支铅笔，问自己，如果真理不在大英博物馆的书架上，那么它到底在何处？","The scene, if I may ask you to follow me, was now changed.The leaves were still falling, but in London now, not Oxbridge; and I must ask you to imagine a room, like many thousands, with a window looking across people’s hats and vans and motorcars to other windows, and on the table inside the room a blank sheet of paper on which was written in large letters WOMEN AND FICTION, but no more.The inevitable sequel to lunching and dining at Oxbridge seemed, unfortunately, to be a visit to the British Museum.One must strain off what was personal and accidental in all these impressions and so reach the pure fluid, the essential oil of truth.For that visit to Oxbridge and the luncheon and the dinner had started a swarm of questions.Why did men drink wine and women water?Why was one sex so prosperous and the other so poor?What effect has poverty on fiction?What conditions are necessary for the creation of works of art?—a thousand questions at once suggested themselves.But one needed answers, not questions; and an answer was only to be had by consulting the learned and the unprejudiced, who have removed themselves above the strife of tongue and the confusion of body and issued the result of their reasoning and research in books which are to be found in the British Museum.If truth is not to be found on the shelves of the British Museum, where, I asked myself, picking up a notebook and a pencil, is truth?"
"作好了这样的准备，带着这样的自信和求知欲，我开始了对真理的探求。虽然那天实际上并没有下雨，却是很阴沉，大英博物馆周围的街上到处都是打开的储煤室，一麻袋一麻袋的煤被倒下去。四轮马车停了下来，把许多用绳子捆着的箱子放在人行道上，箱子里面装的可能是某个瑞士人或者意大利人全家的衣服。他们大概是冬天要到布卢姆斯伯里一带的家庭旅馆里去寻求好运、避难场所，或者其他某种合意的东西。一些平常就嗓音粗哑的人们推着装满植物的手推车，招摇地行走在街上。有些人喊，其他的人唱。伦敦就像一个作坊。伦敦就像一台机器。我们就像织布的梭子，在朴素的底子上被人穿来穿去以织出花样。大英博物馆是这个工厂的另一部分。推开双开式弹簧门，站在那个巨大的圆屋顶下面，好像自己是那个大而秃的前额里的一个思想，前额被一条写满了名人名字的精美带子缠绕着。走到柜台，拿起一个纸条，打开一本目录，并且……这六个点表明在不连续的五分钟内所体会到的惊愕、诧异和迷惑。你们知道一年之中人们会写出多少关于女人的书吗？你们知道其中有多少是男人写的吗？你们有没有意识到，你们或许是天地万物中被讨论得最多的动物？我带着一本笔记本、一支铅笔来这里，打算花费一个早上的时间来阅读，认为在早晨结束时，我可以将真理转移到我的笔记本上。但是我想，要应对这一切，我必须是一群大象和一大群蜘蛛。我是在绝望之际提到了据说是寿命最长和眼睛最多的动物。我需要钢爪铜喙才能穿透那层外壳。可是怎样才能在这一大堆纸中找到那一丁点儿的真理呢？我问自己，然后绝望地开始上上下下地看那长长的书单。甚至连那些书名都启发我深思。性别及其本质很可能引起了医生和生物学家的注意，但是令人吃惊并难以解释的事实是，性别——也就是说女人——也引起了讨人喜欢的散文家、手指灵巧的小说家、有硕士学位的青年、没有学位的男人以及除了不是女人之外没有任何明显资历的男人的关注。这其中有些书，从表面来看，是轻浮而琐屑的；但是从另一方面来说，许多书都是严肃的并带有预言性的，有教育意义并且起激励作用的。仅仅看看那些书名就使人想起，数不清的男教师、数不清的神职人员走上讲台和布道坛，滔滔不绝地讲着，所花的时间远远超过平常拨给这个题目的时间。这是一个非常奇怪的现象，而且很显然——这里我查阅了字母M栏——这种现象只出现在男性身上。女人不写关于男人的书——对这一事实我不禁带着安慰表示欢迎，因为如果我不得不先读完男人写的关于女人的所有书，然后读完女人写的关于男人的所有书，那么一百年开一次花的世纪树将会开两次，然后我才能下笔。因此，我十分随意地选了大概十二本书，把我的小纸条送到金属丝托盘里去，然后坐在我的座位上等着，周围是其他寻找真理精油的人。","Thus provided, thus confident and enquiring, I set out in the pursuit of truth.The day, though not actually wet, was dismal, and the streets in the neighbourhood of the Museum were full of open coal-holes, down which sacks were showering; four-wheeled cabs were drawing up and depositing on the pavement corded boxes containing, presumably, the entire wardrobe of some Swiss or Italian family seeking fortune or refuge or some other desirable commodity which is to be found in the boarding-houses of Bloomsbury in the winter.The usual hoarse-voiced men paraded the streets with plants on barrows.Some shouted; others sang.London was like a workshop.London was like a machine.We were all being shot backwards and forwards on this plain foundation to make some pattern.The British Museum was another department of the factory.The swing-doors swung open; and there one stood under the vast dome, as if one were a thought in the huge bald forehead which is so splendidly encircled by a band of famous names.One went to the counter; one took a slip of paper; one opened a volume of the catalogue, and ..... the five dots here indicate five separate minutes of stupefaction, wonder and bewilderment.Have you any notion of how many books are written about women in the course of one year?Have you any notion how many are written by men?Are you aware that you are, perhaps, the most discussed animal in the universe?Here had I come with a notebook and a pencil proposing to spend a morning reading, supposing that at the end of the morning I should have transferred the truth to my notebook.But I should need to be a herd of elephants, I thought, and a wilderness of spiders, desperately referring to the animals that are reputed longest lived and most multitudinously eyed, to cope with all this.I should need claws of steel and beak of brass even to penetrate the husk.How shall I ever find the grains of truth embedded in all this mass of paper?I asked myself, and in despair began running my eye up and down the long list of titles.Even the names of the books gave me food for thought.Sex and its nature might well attract doctors and biologists; but what was surprising and difficult of explanation was the fact that sex—woman, that is to say—also attracts agreeable essayists, light-fingered novelists, young men who have taken the M.A. degree; men who have taken no degree; men who have no apparent qualification save that they are not women.Some of these books were, on the face of it, frivolous and facetious; but many, on the other hand, were serious and prophetic, moral and hortatory.Merely to read the titles suggested innumerable schoolmasters, innumerable clergymen mounting their platforms and pulpits and holding forth with loquacity which far exceeded the hour usually alloted to such discourse on this one subject.It was a most strange phenomenon; and apparently—here I consulted the letter M—one confined to the male sex. Women do not write books about men—a fact that I could not help welcoming with relief, for if I had first to read all that men have written about women, then all that women have written about men, the aloe that flowers once in a hundred years would flower twice before I could set pen to paper.So, making a perfectly arbitrary choice of a dozen volumes or so, I sent my slips of paper to lie in the wire tray, and waited in my stall, among the other seekers for the essential oil of truth."
"是什么原因造成了这种奇特的差异呢？我揣度着，一面在英国纳税人用于其它用途的小纸条上画着车轮。根据这个目录来看，为什么男人对女人的兴趣要比女人对男人的兴趣大得多？这看起来如此奇怪，于是我开始猜想那些把时间花费在写关于女人的书上的男人的生活。无论他们是年老的还是年轻的，结了婚的还是没结婚的，红鼻子的还是驼背的——无论如何，感觉到自己这样地被人关注是有点沾沾自喜的，只要这些关注不是全来自于那些老弱病残。我这样想着，一直到这些不相干的思想因为一大堆书滑到我面前的桌子上而告一段落。现在麻烦开始了。一个在牛津剑桥接受过研究工作训练的学生肯定有某种方法，能引导他的问题越过分心的事而归到它的答案中去，就像把羊赶入羊圈中一样。例如，我确信，坐在我旁边的那个正在认真抄写一本科学手册的学生，他每隔十分钟左右就提取出一些有价值的精油。他因满意而发出微弱的咕哝声，这正表明了这一点。但是如果一个人不幸没有在大学时得到训练，问题不但不会被赶回到它的“羊圈”里，反而会像一群受惊的羊一样被一群猎狗追逐着，仓皇失措地东奔西跑。教授、男教师、社会学家、神职人员、小说家、散文家、新闻记者以及那些除了不是女人以外没有其他资历的男人追逐着我那简单而且单一的问题——为什么有些女人贫穷？——直到它变成五十个问题；直到那五十个问题狂乱地跳到河流正中被冲走。我笔记本中的每一页都潦草地写满了笔记。为了表明我当时的心境，我将把其中的一些念给你们听，需要说明的是，笔记的标题很简单，就是用大写字母写的“女人和贫困”，但是接下来的内容却是这样的：","What could be the reason, then, of this curious disparity, I wondered, drawing cart-wheels on the slips of paper provided by the British taxpayer for other purposes.Why are women, judging from this catalogue, so much more interesting to men than men are to women?A very curious fact it seemed, and my mind wandered to picture the lives of men who spend their time in writing books about women; whether they were old or young, married or unmarried, red-nosed or hump-backed—anyhow, it was flattering, vaguely, to feel oneself the object of such attention provided that it was not entirely bestowed by the crippled and the infirm—so I pondered until all such frivolous thoughts were ended by an avalanche of books sliding down on to the desk in front of me. Now the trouble began.The student who has been trained in research at Oxbridge has no doubt some method of shepherding his question past all distractions till it runs into his answer as a sheep runs into its pen.The student by my side, for instance, who was copying assiduously from a scientific manual, was, I felt sure, extracting pure nuggets of essential oil every ten minutes or so.His little grunts of satisfaction indicated so much.But if, unfortunately, one has had no training in a university, the question far from being shepherded to its pen flies like a frightened flock hither and thither, helter-skelter, pursued by a whole pack of hounds.Professors, schoolmasters, sociologists, clergymen, novelists, essayists, journalists, men who had no qualification save that they were not women, chased my simple and single question—Why are some women poor?—until it became fifty questions; until the fifty questions leapt frantically into midstream and were carried away.Every page in my notebook was scribbled over with notes.To show the state of mind I was in, I will read you a few of them, explaining that the page was headed quite simply, WOMEN AND POVERTY, in block letters; but what followed was something like this:"

"在这里我歇了口气，并且在边上的空白处切实地加了一句：为什么塞缪尔·巴特勒说，“聪明的男人从来不谈他们对女人的看法”？而很显然，聪明的男人从来不说除女人之外其他的事情。但是，仰靠着我的椅子，望着巨大的圆屋顶——我是里面的一个思想，不过现在这思想有点儿窘困，我继续想道，很不幸的是，聪明人对女人的意见从未一致过。蒲柏说：","Here I drew breath and added, indeed, in the margin, Why does Samuel Butler say, ‘Wise men never say what they think of women’?Wise men never say anything else apparently.But, I continued, leaning back in my chair and looking at the vast dome in which I was a single but by now somewhat harassed thought, what is so unfortunate is that wise men never think the same thing about women.Here is Pope:"

"这两个人处于同一时代，都是敏锐的观察家，却有着截然相反的观点。女人到底能不能受教育呢？拿破仑认为她们不能。约翰逊博士的想法正好相反。[3]她们究竟有没有灵魂？有些野蛮人说没有。相反，有些人断言女人几乎就是神，并因此崇拜她们。[4]有些圣人认为她们的头脑较浅薄；另一些则认为她们的意识更深刻。歌德尊敬她们；墨索里尼鄙视她们。不管朝哪儿看，男人都在思考女人，而且看法总是不同。我断定，把这些都弄清楚是不可能了。我羡慕地瞥了一眼隔壁那位读者，他把摘要写得那么工整，摘要上端往往都写着A、B或C，而我自己的笔记本则一团糟，涂满了极为潦草的相互对立的摘记。这让人烦恼，让人不知所措，同时又让人觉得丢脸。真理从我的指缝间溜走了。一滴都没有剩下。","a direct contradiction by keen observers who were contemporary.Are they capable of education or incapable?Napoleon thought them incapable.Dr Johnson thought the opposite.[3]Have they souls or have they not souls?Some savages say they have none.Others, on the contrary, maintain that women are half divine and worship them on that account. [4]Some sages hold that they are shallower in the brain; others that they are deeper in the consciousness.Goethe honoured them; Mussolini despises them.Wherever one looked men thought about women and thought differently.It was impossible to make head or tail of it all, I decided, glancing with envy at the reader next door who was making the neatest abstracts, headed often with an A or a B or a C, while my own notebook rioted with the wildest scribble of contradictory jottings.It was distressing, it was bewildering, it was humiliating.Truth had run through my fingers.Every drop had escaped."
"我想我不能就这样回家，要在“女人与小说”的研究上加上这些：女人的体毛比男人少一些，或者南太平洋诸岛上女人的发育年龄是九岁——还是九十岁？这也算是一种重大的贡献，尽管笔迹因注意力分散而变得难以辨认。工作了整个早晨却没有干出一点有分量、可以拿得出手的成绩是不光彩的。而且，假使我还不能领会以前的关于W.（简便起见，我用“女人”这个单词的第一个字母“W”来代替女人）的真理，又何必为将来的W.烦恼呢？请教那些对女人及其在政治、孩子、工资、道德等方面的影响有专门研究的绅士们似乎是在白白浪费时间，纵使他们人数众多，学问也很高深。人们恐怕也不会翻开他们的书。","I could not possibly go home, I reflected, and add as a serious contribution to the study of women and fiction that women have less hair on their bodies than men, or that the age of puberty among the South Sea Islanders is nine—or is it ninety?—even the handwriting had become in its distraction indecipherable.It was disgraceful to have nothing more weighty or respectable to show after a whole morning’s work.And if I could not grasp the truth about W.(as for brevity's sake I had come to call her) in the past, why bother about W. in the future?It seemed pure waste of time to consult all those gentlemen who specialize in woman and her effect on whatever it may be—politics, children, wages, morality—numerous and learned as they are. One might as well leave their books unopened."
"但在我思考的时候，我又很倦怠、绝望，不知不觉地画了幅画，而这个画画的地方是用来像我邻座那样写结论的。我画了一张脸，一个人体。那是冯·X教授的脸和身体，他正在写着他的伟大著作——《女人的智力、道德和体力的低下》。他在我的图画里不是一个能吸引女人的男人。他身体笨重，下巴很大；为了与此协调，他长了一双很小的眼睛；他的脸很红。　　 　他的神情表明，他正在某种情感的驱动下写作。这种情感促使他把笔往纸上戳，像是要在写字时戳死某个害虫，甚至把它弄死了还不能满足，还要继续戳。尽管这样，让他生气发怒的缘由仍未消散。　看着这幅画，我猜度，难道是因为他太太吗？难道她爱上了一个骑兵军官？而那军官身材修长，举止文雅，穿着俄国羔皮衣？若采用弗洛伊德的理论，是不是他在孩提时代就被一个漂亮女孩嘲笑过？因为我觉得这位教授在孩提时代也不会是一个有吸引力的孩子。不管是哪种缘由，在我的素描中，这位教授在他的伟大著作中描写妇女智力、道德和体力上的低下时，看上去非常愤怒、非常丑陋。一上午的工作徒劳无益，画图画是结束这一上午工作的一种闲散的方式。然而有时候，就是在我们无所事事时，在我们的幻想中，被淹没的真理会浮上来。通过心理学的基本练习（还不能称其为心理分析来抬高它的身价），我从笔记本上看出，这幅生气的教授的素描是我在气头上画出来的。在我胡思乱想的时候，怒气夺去了我的铅笔。不过怒气正在那里做什么呢？兴趣、困惑、娱乐、无聊——所有这些情绪我都可以感受到并把它们一一道出，因为整个上午它们一个接着一个涌上心头。难道怒气那条黑蛇就潜伏在那里面吗？对，素描说，怒气就潜伏在里面。它使我清楚明白地注意到那本书、那句话，是它们激怒了那魔鬼。那就是教授针对女人在智力、道德、体力上的低下所作的陈述。我心跳加快。脸颊发烧。气得满脸通红。尽管这是件傻事，但也不足为奇。没人愿意听说自己天生就不如这样一个小男人——我看着我旁边这个学生——他喘着粗气，戴着打好结的领带，而且两个星期没刮胡子了。每个人都会有某些愚蠢的虚荣心。我想这不过是人的天性，然后开始在这位发怒的教授的脸上画车轮，画圆圈，直到他看起来像一个着了火的小丛林，或者是燃烧的彗星——总之，活脱脱一个幽灵，既没有人的外表，也没有人的意义。现在，这位教授仅仅是汉普斯特德石南荒原上燃烧的柴把而已。不久我的怒气就得到了解释并消散了，不过好奇心未减。教授们的怒气又如何解释呢？他们为什么生气？每当要分析这些书留下的印象时，总会有一种激昂的成分。这种激昂表现出来的方式有很多：讽刺、伤感、好奇、责备。但也有另外一种成分，它经常出现而且不能被立即识别出来。我称之为怒气。但它是这样的怒气——钻到下面和别的各种情绪混在一起。根据它造成的奇特效果来判断，这怒气不是简单率性的怒气，而是化了装的、复杂的怒气。","But while I pondered I had unconsciously, in my listlessness, in my desperation, been drawing a picture where I should, like my neighbour, have been writing a conclusion.I had been drawing a face, a figure.It was the face and the figure of Professor von X engaged in writing his monumental work entitled THE MENTAL, MORAL, AND PHYSICAL INFERIORITY OF THE FEMALE SEX. He was not in my picture a man attractive to women.He was heavily built; he had a great jowl; to balance that he had very small eyes; he was very red in the face.His expression suggested that he was labouring under some emotion that made him jab his pen on the paper as if he were killing some noxious insect as he wrote, but even when he had killed it that did not satisfy him; he must go on killing it; and even so, some cause for anger and irritation remained.Could it be his wife, I asked, looking at my picture?Was she in love with a cavalry officer?Was the cavalry officer slim and elegant and dressed in astrakhan?Had he been laughed at, to adopt the Freudian theory, in his cradle by a pretty girl?For even in his cradle the professor, I thought, could not have been an attractive child.Whatever the reason, the professor was made to look very angry and very ugly in my sketch, as he wrote his great book upon the mental, moral and physical inferiority of women.Drawing pictures was an idle way of finishing an unprofitable morning’s work.Yet it is in our idleness, in our dreams, that the submerged truth sometimes comes to the top.A very elementary exercise in psychology, not to be dignified by the name of psychoanalysis, showed me, on looking at my notebook, that the sketch of the angry professor had been made in anger.Anger had snatched my pencil while I dreamt.But what was anger doing there?Interest, confusion, amusement, boredom—all these emotions I could trace and name as they succeeded each other throughout the morning.Had anger, the black snake, been lurking among them?Yes, said the sketch, anger had.It referred me unmistakably to the one book, to the one phrase, which had roused the demon; it was the professor’s statement about the mental, moral and physical inferiority of women.My heart had leapt.My cheeks had burnt.I had flushed with anger.There was nothing specially remarkable, however foolish, in that.One does not like to be told that one is naturally the inferior of a little man—I looked at the student next me—who breathes hard, wears a ready-made tie, and has not shaved this fortnight.One has certain foolish vanities.It is only human nature, I reflected, and began drawing cartwheels and circles over the angry professor’s face till he looked like a burning bush or a flaming comet—anyhow, an apparition without human semblance or significance.The professor was nothing now but a faggot burning on the top of Hampstead Heath.Soon my own anger was explained and done with; but curiosity remained.How explain the anger of the professors?Why were they angry?For when it came to analysing the impression left by these books there was always an element of heat.This heat took many forms; it showed itself in satire, in sentiment, in curiosity, in reprobation.But there was another element which was often present and could not immediately be identified.Anger, I called it.But it was anger that had gone underground and mixed itself with all kinds of other emotions.To judge from its odd effects, it was anger disguised and complex, not anger simple and open."
"不管理由是什么，审视桌上那一大堆书时，我想，就我的目的而言，所有这些书都没什么价值。也就是说，虽然从人类角度来看，这些书中充盈着教导、趣味、无聊以及关于斐济岛居民习性的一些十分古怪的事实，从科学上讲它们是无价值的。它们是在红色的情感之光下写成，而不是在白色的真理之光下。因此我必须把它们放回到中间的桌子上去，好让它们都回到位于大蜂房中的各自的巢室。我从一上午的工作中检索到的所有内容就是那个愤怒的事实。那些教授们——我这样把他们归并在一起——着实生气了。放回书后，我站在廊柱下，四周都是鸽子和史前的独木舟；我反复地问自己，但是为什么，为什么他们那么生气呢？就这样，我一边问着自己，一边踱着步子走出去，去找地方解决午餐。现在这个被我叫做“他们的怒气”的东西，它的真实性质到底是什么呢？我问道。这个谜团会一直持续下去，直到大英博物馆附近什么地方的一家小饭馆把饭菜端上来。之前某位用过午餐的客人把晚报的午刊留在了椅子上，我在等饭菜上来时，无所事事地读了读大标题。一行大字母像丝带一样横穿报纸。有人在南非取得了高分。小一点的字母声称，奥斯汀·张伯伦现在在日内瓦。一把肉斧在地窖里被发现，上面有人的头发。某某法官在离婚法庭上斥责妇女的无耻。散布在报纸各处的还有其他新闻。一个电影女演员在加利福尼亚的一个山顶上被人用绳子吊下来，悬在半空中。未来将会是多雾天气。我想，即便是在地球上短暂停留的旅客，如果捡起这张报纸，也能从这零碎的证据中看出，英国是被父权制统治。任何一个心智健全的人都会觉察出那位教授的统治地位。他就是权力，就是金钱，就是影响力。他是这份报纸的老板、主编、审稿人。他是外交大臣，是法官。他是板球运动员，拥有赛马用的马和游艇。他是发给股东百分之两百红利的公司的董事。他留下了几百万财产，捐助他曾管理过的慈善机构和大学。他把女明星吊在半空中。他将决定肉斧上的头发是不是人的头发，是开释那个杀人犯还是定他死罪，是将他吊死还是还他自由。除了雾以外，他好像掌控着所有的事。可是他生气了。从这一点上，我知道他生气了。当读到他写的关于女人的文字时，我想的并不是他说的话，而是他本人。如果辩论者不带感情地争论，那么他想的只是论据；他的读者想着的不禁也是他的论据。如果他不带感情地写了关于女人的文字，用无可争辩的证据来证实自己的论点，并且毫无迹象表明他所希望的结果是此而非彼，那么人们也不会生气，人们会接受事实，就像承认豌豆是绿的、金丝雀是黄的一样。如果是这样的话，我就会说，就那样吧。可是我生气了，因为他生气了。我一边翻阅晚报一边在想，有这般权力的人也会生气，未免太荒唐了吧。我疑惑，难道怒气是权力带来的、为人所熟知的幽灵？譬如就说那些富人吧，他们生气是因为他们怀疑穷人想要夺取他们的财富。可那些教授们呢，或者叫他们族长可能更准确些，他们生气大概部分是因为那个理由，部分是因为一个在表面上看来不太明显的理由。可能他们根本就没有“生气”；确实，他们常常赞美别人，待人忠实，是私人生活中的典范。也可能在那位教授稍有点过分地强调女人的低下时，他所关心的并不是她们的低下，而是他自己的优越。而那才是他过分强调、急于庇护的东西，因为对他而言，它就是一颗价格极为罕见的宝石。生活，对于男女两性来说——我看着他们在人行道上用肩膀挤出一条路——都是艰苦的、困难的，是一场永久的斗争。需要超乎寻常的勇气和力量。或许我们是幻觉的产物，我们更需要的是对自己的信心。没有自信，我们就犹如躺在摇篮里的婴儿。那么，我们要怎么样才能最快地生成这种无法估量而又极其可贵的自信呢？那就是去想别人不如自己。认为自己天生比别人优越——可能是说财富、地位，或者直挺挺的鼻子，甚至一张罗姆尼所作的祖父的画像——因为人类想象力的那些可怜花样是无穷无尽的。因此对一个需要征服、需要统治的族长来说，这种多数人（实际上是人类的一半）天生都不如他的感觉尤为重要。这种优越的感觉一定是他权力的主要来源之一。但是我想，还是让我把这种观察的角度转到现实生活中去。它是不是有助于解释人们在日常生活的边缘中所注意到的一些心理上的困惑？它能解释我那天的惊讶吗？那天，Z——最通情达理、最谦和的一个人，拿起一本丽贝卡·韦斯特的书，读了一段就叫喊起来：“这个坏透了的女权主义者！竟说男人都是势利眼！”他的喊叫让我大为惊讶，为什么韦斯特小姐对男人作了一句不中听但却很可能正确的评语就成了坏透了的女权主义者呢？这声喊叫不仅是他受伤的虚荣心发出的喊叫，也是一种抗议，抗议对他自信的力量的某种侵犯。","Whatever the reason, all these books, I thought, surveying the pile on the desk, are worthless for my purposes.They were worthless scientifically, that is to say, though humanly they were full of instruction, interest, boredom, and very queer facts about the habits of the Fiji Islanders.They had been written in the red light of emotion and not in the white light of truth.Therefore they must be returned to the central desk and restored each to his own cell in the enormous honeycomb.All that I had retrieved from that morning’s work had been the one fact of anger.The professors—I lumped them together thus—were angry.But why, I asked myself, having returned the books, why, I repeated, standing under the colonnade among the pigeons and the prehistoric canoes, why are they angry?And, asking myself this question, I strolled off to find a place for luncheon.What is the real nature of what I call for the moment their anger?I asked.Here was a puzzle that would last all the time that it takes to be served with food in a small restaurant somewhere near the British Museum.Some previous luncher had left the lunch edition of the evening paper on a chair, and, waiting to be served, I began idly reading the headlines.A ribbon of very large letters ran across the page.Somebody had made a big score in South Africa.Lesser ribbons announced that Sir Austen Chamberlain was at Geneva.A meat axe with human hair on it had been found in a cellar.Mr justice—commented in the Divorce Courts upon the Shamelessness of Women.Sprinkled about the paper were other pieces of news.A film actress had been lowered from a peak in California and hung suspended in mid-air.The weather was going to be foggy.The most transient visitor to this planet, I thought, who picked up this paper could not fail to be aware, even from this scattered testimony, that England is under the rule of a patriarchy.Nobody in their senses could fail to detect the dominance of the professor.His was the power and the money and the influence.He was the proprietor of the paper and its editor and sub-editor.He was the Foreign Secretary and the judge.He was the cricketer; he owned the racehorses and the yachts.He was the director of the company that pays two hundred per cent to its shareholders.He left millions to charities and colleges that were ruled by himself.He suspended the film actress in mid-air.He will decide if the hair on the meat axe is human; he it is who will acquit or convict the murderer, and hang him, or let him go free.With the exception of the fog he seemed to control everything.Yet he was angry.I knew that he was angry by this token.When I read what he wrote about women—I thought, not of what he was saying, but of himself.When an arguer argues dispassionately he thinks only of the argument; and the reader cannot help thinking of the argument too.If he had written dispassionately about women, had used indisputable proofs to establish his argument and had shown no trace of wishing that the result should be one thing rather than another, one would not have been angry either.One would have accepted the fact, as one accepts the fact that a pea is green or a canary yellow.So be it, I should have said.But I had been angry because he was angry.Yet it seemed absurd, I thought, turning over the evening paper, that a man with all this power should be angry.Or is anger, I wondered, somehow, the familiar, the attendant sprite on power?Rich people, for example, are often angry because they suspect that the poor want to seize their wealth.The professors, or patriarchs, as it might be more accurate to call them, might be angry for that reason partly, but partly for one that lies a little less obviously on the surface.Possibly they were not ‘angry’ at all; often, indeed, they were admiring, devoted, exemplary in the relations of private life.Possibly when the professor insisted a little too emphatically upon the inferiority of women, he was concerned not with their inferiority, but with his own superiority.That was what he was protecting rather hot-headedly and with too much emphasis, because it was a jewel to him of the rarest price.Life for both sexes—and I looked at them, shouldering their way along the pavement—is arduous, difficult, a perpetual struggle.It calls for gigantic courage and strength.More than anything, perhaps, creatures of illusion as we are, it calls for confidence in oneself.Without self-confidence we are as babes in the cradle.And how can we generate this imponderable quality, which is yet so invaluable, most quickly?By thinking that other people are inferior to one self.By feeling that one has some innate superiority—it may be wealth, or rank, a straight nose, or the portrait of a grandfather by Romney—for there is no end to the pathetic devices of the human imagination—over other people.Hence the enormous importance to a patriarch who has to conquer, who has to rule, of feeling that great numbers of people, half the human race indeed, are by nature inferior to himself.It must indeed be one of the chief sources of his power.But let me turn the light of this observation on to real life, I thought.Does it help to explain some of those psychological puzzles that one notes in the margin of daily life?Does it explain my astonishment of the other day when Z, most humane, most modest of men, taking up some book by Rebecca West and reading a passage in it, exclaimed, ‘The arrant feminist!She says that men are snobs!’ The exclamation, to me so surprising—for why was Miss West an arrant feminist for making a possibly true if uncomplimentary statement about the other sex?—was not merely the cry of wounded vanity; it was a protest against some infringement of his power to believe in himself."
"女人这几百年来好像都是用来做镜子的，这镜子拥有神奇而又宜人的力量，能把男人的身形照成其天生大小的两倍。如果没有这种力量，只怕世界现在还只是沼泽和丛林。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　我们所有战争的光荣史就不会为人所知。只怕我们依然在残余的羊骨上画着鹿的图形，拿火石换取羊皮或任何能迎合我们质朴口味的简单装饰品。超人和命运之手就不会存在。俄国沙皇和德国皇帝就根本不会戴上了皇冠又失去皇冠。无论这些镜子在文明社会里有什么用途，它们对于暴力和英勇的行为来说是必需的。这就是为什么拿破仑和墨索里尼都如此强调女人的低下，因为假使她们不低下，他们就不能被放大。这也在一定程度上解释了女人对于男人的必要性。还可以用来解释女人的批判使他们如何地不安，而且她对他们说这本书不好，这幅画没有生气，或者其他什么毛病的时候，与一个男人作出同样的批评相比，她们都一定会导致更大的痛苦，并激起更大的愤怒。因为她一说实话，镜子里的身形就会缩小，他在生活中的合适程度就会降低。如果他在吃早餐、午餐时没能看见比自己的真实尺寸至少大一倍的自己，又怎能继续作出判断、教化土生土长者、制定法律、撰写书籍、身穿礼服在宴会上演讲呢？我就这样揣摩着，同时弄碎了面包，搅动着咖啡，并时不时看看路上的行人。镜子的幻象至关重要，因为它能激发生命力，刺激神经系统。倘若把它拿走，男人也许会死，就像被夺走了可卡因的瘾君子一样。我望着窗外，思考着，人行道上有一半的人都在那幻影的魔力下大步奔向工作的地方。早晨，在镜子那令人愉快的光线下，他们戴上了帽子，穿好了衣服。这样，他们开始了充满自信、精神振奋的一天，相信会收到史密斯小姐的茶会的邀请。他们一边走进房间，一边对自己说，“我比这里一半的人都要优越”，也正因为如此，他们说话时富有自信，这种自信在公众生活中产生了深远的影响，并在私人头脑的边缘留下了怪异的注解。","Women have served all these centuries as looking-glasses possessing the magic and delicious power of reflecting the figure of man at twice its natural size.Without that power probably the earth would still be swamp and jungle.The glories of all our wars would be unknown.We should still be scratching the outlines of deer on the remains of mutton bones and bartering flints for sheep skins or whatever simple ornament took our unsophisticated taste.Supermen and Fingers of Destiny would never have existed.The Czar and the Kaiser would never have worn crowns or lost them.Whatever may be their use in civilized societies, mirrors are essential to all violent and heroic action.That is why Napoleon and Mussolini both insist so emphatically upon the inferiority of women, for if they were not inferior, they would cease to enlarge.That serves to explain in part the necessity that women so often are to men.And it serves to explain how restless they are under her criticism; how impossible it is for her to say to them this book is bad, this picture is feeble, or whatever it may be, without giving far more pain and rousing far more anger than a man would do who gave the same criticism.For if she begins to tell the truth, the figure in the looking-glass shrinks; his fitness for life is diminished.How is he to go on giving judgement, civilizing natives, making laws, writing books, dressing up and speechifying at banquets, unless he can see himself at breakfast and at dinner at least twice the size he really is?So I reflected, crumbling my bread and stirring my coffee and now and again looking at the people in the street.The looking-glass vision is of supreme importance because it charges the vitality; it stimulates the nervous system.Take it away and man may die, like the drug fiend deprived of his cocaine.Under the spell of that illusion, I thought, looking out of the window, half the people on the pavement are striding to work.They put on their hats and coats in the morning under its agreeable rays.They start the day confident, braced, believing themselves desired at Miss Smith’s tea party; they say to themselves as they go into the room, I am the superior of half the people here, and it is thus that they speak with that self-confidence, that selfassurance, which have had such profound consequences in public life and lead to such curious notes in the margin of the private mind."
"另一性别的心理是个危险而又吸引人的话题，但是对这一话题的这些贡献——希望等到你们每年有五百英镑自己的收入时，也研究一下这个话题——在必须付饭钱的时候被打断了。饭钱是五先令九便士。我递给侍者一张十先令的票子，他拿去找钱。我的钱包里还有一张十先令的票子；我注意到它了，因为这仍然是个让我激动得透不过气来的事实——我的钱包有自动产生十先令钞票的魔力。我每次打开它，钞票必定在那儿。社会提供给我鸡肉和咖啡、床和住所，来换取我一个姑妈留给我的若干纸张。这些纸张留给了我，只因为我和她名字一样，再没有其他理由。　","But these contributions to the dangerous and fascinating subject of the psychology of the other sex—it is one, I hope, that you will investigate when you have five hundred a year of your own—were interrupted by the necessity of paying the bill.It came to five shillings and ninepence.I gave the waiter a ten-shilling note and he went to bring me change.There was another ten-shilling note in my purse; I noticed it, because it is a fact that still takes my breath away the power of my purse to breed ten-shilling notes automatically.I open it and there they are. Society gives me chicken and coffee, bed and lodging, in return for a certain number of pieces of paper which were left me by an aunt, for no other reason than that I share her name."
"我有必要解释一下，我的姑妈玛丽·贝顿，在孟买骑马去户外呼吸新鲜空气时，从马上跌下来摔死了。就在妇女拥有选举权的法令得以通过的那天晚上，差不多同一时间，我得到了拥有这笔遗产的消息。律师的信落在信箱里，我拆开信后得知，她永久性地留给我每年五百英镑。这两件东西中间——选举权和钱，归我所有的钱似乎要重要得多。以前，我只能在报社里谋点零活勉强度日，诸如报道一下这里的骑驴表演，或是报道一下那里的婚礼。我也曾为了赚几个英镑，替人在信封上写姓名和地址，读书给老太太听，做假花，在幼儿园教小孩子念字母表。这些是一九一八年之前女人可以做的主要职业。恐怕用不着我去详细描述这些工作的艰辛，大概你们也认识做过这类事的女人；我也无需描述拿赚来的这么一点钱去维持生活的困苦，你们大概尝到过其中的滋味。不过直到现在，我还受着比上述两者更厉害的伤害，那就是那种日子在我身上产生的恐惧和愤恨的毒物。首先，总得做自己不爱做的工作，像奴隶一般谄媚、奉承，或许不一定总要这样，但又似乎需要这样，因为冒险的话，赌注太大了；再者，想到那用死亡隐藏的才能——它确实是很小的才能，不过对于拥有它的人来说却是弥足珍贵的——它和我的身体、我的灵魂一起消失了。所有这一切像锈菌一样腐蚀了春天的花朵，从树心摧毁了一棵树。不过，我上面说过了，我姑妈死了；每当我兑换一张十先令的票子，锈菌和因腐蚀而产生的一些东西就被擦拭掉一些，胆怯和愤恨也会消失。我把找回的银币放进钱包里，回想以往日子里的那种愤恨，心想，一笔固定的收入竟会让脾气产生如此大的改变，这的确是引人注目的。世界上没有哪种力量能从我这里把我的五百英镑夺走。衣、食、住永远都是我的。因此辛苦劳作没有了，仇恨和愤恨也烟消云散了。我不必怀恨任何人；任何人也伤害不了我。我也不再需要讨好奉承任何人；他给不了我什么东西。于是不知不觉，我改变了原来的对人类的另一半的态度。把任何阶级或任何性别作为一个整体来责难，这样的行为是荒唐的。巨大的人群从不需要对他们所做的事负责。他们受本能的驱使，这种本能他们自己也控制不了。那些族长、教授们也有无尽的困难和可怕的障碍需要克服。在一些方面，他们所接受的教育和我接受的教育一样有缺陷。这样的教育在他们身上产生了同样大的缺点。没错，他们有钱有权，但却是以把老鹰、兀鹫藏在胸口作为代价的，它们一直在撕扯肝脏，拉扯肺叶；那占有的本能、攫取的疯狂促使他们永不停息地想要获得他人的田地货物，促使他们乱划边界，滥挂旗帜，促使他们制造战舰毒气，促使他们贡献出他们自己和儿女的性命。穿过海军部大楼的拱门（我已经走到那个纪念门前了），或穿过陈列着战利品和大炮的那条大道，便可以回想在那里庆祝的那种光荣。或者在春光下看着股票经纪人和大律师，看他们走进屋里去赚钱，赚越来越多的钱；事实上，每年五百英镑够一个人生活在阳光之中了。我经深思后明白，这些是令人很不愉快的本能。我想，它们是生活条件的产物，是文明缺失的产物；我目不转睛地盯着剑桥公爵像，特别是他三角帽上的羽毛，大概没有人像我这样凝视它们。　　　　　　　　　　　　　等我意识到这些障碍，心里的胆怯和愤恨就渐渐地变成了怜悯和容忍；再过一两年，怜悯和容忍消失了，到来的是最大程度的解脱，那是一种就事物本身来考虑的自由。譬如，我喜不喜欢那建筑？那张画美不美？那本书我觉得好不好？确实，我姑妈的遗产将天空呈现在我面前，并且用开阔的天空的景象代替绅士高大不凡的身影，而这身影是弥尔顿建议我去永久崇拜的。","My aunt, Mary Beton, I must tell you, died by a fall from her horse when she was riding out to take the air in Bombay.The news of my legacy reached me one night about the same time that the act was passed that gave votes to women.A solicitor’s letter fell into the post-box and when I opened it I found that she had left me five hundred pounds a year for ever.Of the two—the vote and the money—the money, I own, seemed infinitely the more important.Before that I had made my living by cadging odd jobs from newspapers, by reporting a donkey show here or a wedding there; I had earned a few pounds by addressing envelopes, reading to old ladies, making artificial flowers, teaching the alphabet to small children in a kinder garten.Such were the chief occupations that were open to women before 1918.I need not, I am afraid, describe in any detail the hardness of the work, for you know perhaps women who have done it; nor the difficulty of living on the money when it was earned, for you may have tried.But what still remains with me as a worse infliction than either was the poison of fear and bitterness which those days bred in me.To begin with, always to be doing work that one did not wish to do, and to do it like a slave, flattering and fawning, not always necessarily perhaps, but it seemed necessary and the stakes were too great to run risks; and then the thought of that one gift which it was death to hide—a small one but dear to the possessor—perishing and with it my self, my soul,—all this became like a rust eating away the bloom of the spring, destroying the tree at its heart.However, as I say, my aunt died; and whenever I change a tenshilling note a little of that rust and corrosion is rubbed off, fear and bitterness go. Indeed, I thought, slipping the silver into my purse, it is remarkable, remembering the bitterness of those days, what a change of temper a fixed income will bring about.No force in the world can take from me my five hundred pounds.Food, house and clothing are mine forever.Therefore not merely do effort and labour cease, but also hatred and bitterness.I need not hate any man; he cannot hurt me.I need not flatter any man; he has nothing to give me.So imperceptibly I found myself adopting a new attitude towards the other half of the human race.It was absurd to blame any class or any sex, as a whole.Great bodies of people are never responsible for what they do.They are driven by instincts which are not within their control.They too, the patriarchs, the professors, had endless difficulties, terrible drawbacks to contend with.Their education had been in some ways as faulty as my own.It had bred in them defects as great.True, they had money and power, but only at the cost of harbouring in their breasts an eagle, a vulture, for ever tearing the liver out and plucking at the lungs—the instinct for possession, the rage for acquisition which drives them to desire other people’s fields and goods perpetually; to make frontiers and flags; battleships and poison gas; to offer up their own lives and their children’s lives.Walk through the Admiralty Arch (I had reached that monument), or any other avenue given up to trophies and cannon, and reflect upon the kind of glory celebrated there.Or watch in the spring sunshine the stockbroker and the great barrister going indoors to make money and more money and more money when it is a fact that five hundred pounds a year will keep one alive in the sunshine.These are unpleasant instincts to harbour, I reflected.They are bred of the conditions of life; of the lack of civilization, I thought, looking at the statue of the Duke of Cambridge, and in particular at the feathers in his cocked hat, with a fixity that they have scarcely ever received before.And, as I realized these drawbacks, by degrees fear and bitterness modified themselves into pity and toleration; and then in a year or two, pity and toleration went, and the greatest release of all came, which is freedom to think of things in themselves.That building, for example, do I like it or not?Is that picture beautiful or not?Is that in my opinion a good book or a bad?Indeed my aunt’s legacy unveiled the sky to me, and substituted for the large and imposing figure of a gentleman, which Milton recommended for my perpetual adoration, a view of the open sky."
"就这么默想、思索着，我取道回到了河边的家。灯已经点亮了，从早上起，伦敦城发生了一种无法形容的变化。好像是那台大机器，结束了一天的劳作后，在我们的协助下，造出了几码美丽而又令人兴奋的东西——一块闪着红色眼睛、如火一般的织物，一个喷着热气、吼叫着的黄褐色怪物。甚至风就像一面旗子在乱飘，它拍击着房子，弄得临时围篱啪啪作响。","So thinking, so speculating I found my way back to my house by the river.Lamps were being lit and an indescribable change had come over London since the morning hour.It was as if the great machine after labouring all day had made with our help a few yards of something very exciting and beautiful—a fiery fabric flashing with red eyes, a tawny monster roaring with hot breath.Even the wind seemed flung like a flag as it lashed the houses and rattled the hoardings."
"然而，在我的小街道上，家庭生活占着优势。房屋油漆匠正由梯子上下来；保姆小心翼翼地把婴儿车推进去，又推出来到育婴室给孩子喂茶点；煤炭装卸工人正在折叠空袋子，把它们一个一个摞起来；那个开蔬菜水果店的女人戴着红色手套，正把这一天的收入加起来。可是由于我全神贯注地思考着你们放在我肩上的问题，竟在看这些再普通不过的景象时，也不能把它们归纳到一个中心上去了。我想，甚至和一百年前相比，现在要说哪种工作更为高尚、更为必要，也要困难许多。是做煤炭装卸工人好还是做保姆好？是不是养育八个孩子的打杂女佣对世人的价值要比一年有十万英镑收入的律师小？问这些问题也是徒劳，因为没有人能回答。不只是打杂女佣与律师的相对价值每过十年就会有所涨落，而且我们没有标尺可用来衡量他们甚至在此刻的价值。我那时很愚蠢，去要求我的教授在他对女人的论证中，提供给我这样或那样的“无可争辩的证据”。即使一个人当下可以陈述出某种才能的价值，那些价值还会变；很可能一百年后，它们就变得面目全非。此外，当我到了家门口时，心想，一百年后女人就不再是被保护的性别了。按逻辑，那时她们可以参加各种活动，付出各种努力，而这些曾把她们拒之门外。保姆可能会去装卸煤炭。开店的女人将要开火车。在女人是被保护的性别时，人们基于所观察到的事实，产生了各种假定，而所有这些假定都将会消失——举个例子（现在有一小队兵走过这条街），人们都认为，女人、神职人员和园丁比其他人寿命长。取消那种保护，让她们付出同样的努力，参加同样的活动，让她们当兵，当水手，做火车司机，做码头工人，那女人是不是会比男人死得更早更快？人们将会说，“我今天看见了一个女人”，就像之前人们说“我今天看见了一架飞机”一样。等到女人不再是被保护的职业时，什么事都可能发生；我这么想着，同时打开了门。不过所有这些与我论文的主题“女人和小说”又有什么关系呢？进门时我问自己。","In my little street, however, domesticity prevailed.The house painter was descending his ladder; the nursemaid was wheeling the perambulator carefully in and out back to nursery tea; the coal-heaver was folding his empty sacks on top of each other; the woman who keeps the green grocer’s shop was adding up the day’s takings with her hands in red mittens.But so engrossed was I with the problem you have laid upon my shoulders that I could not see even these usual sights without referring them to one centre.I thought how much harder it is now than it must have been even a century ago to say which of these employments is the higher, the more necessary.Is it better to be a coal-heaver or a nursemaid; is the charwoman who has brought up eight children of less value to the world than, the barrister who has made a hundred thousand pounds?It is useless to ask such questions; for nobody can answer them.Not only do the comparative values of charwomen and lawyers rise and fall from decade to decade, but we have no rods with which to measure them even as they are at the moment.I had been foolish to ask my professor to furnish me with ‘indisputable proofs’ of this or that in his argument about women.Even if one could state the value of any one gift at the moment, those values will change; in a century’s time very possibly they will have changed completely.Moreover, in a hundred years, I thought, reaching my own doorstep, women will have ceased to be the protected sex.Logically they will take part in all the activities and exertions that were once denied them.The nursemaid will heave coal.The shopwoman will drive an engine.All assumptions founded on the facts observed when women were the protected sex will have disappeared—as, for example (here a squad of soldiers marched down the street), that women and clergymen and gardeners live longer than other people.Remove that protection, expose them to the same exertions and activities, make them soldiers and sailors and engine-drivers and dock labourers, and will not women die off so much younger, so much quicker, than men that one will say, ‘I saw a woman today’, as one used to say, ‘I saw an aeroplane’.Anything may happen when womanhood has ceased to be a protected occupation, I thought, opening the door.But what bearing has all this upon the subject of my paper, Women and Fiction? I asked, going indoors."

"第三章","CHAPTER THREE"
"晚上没有带回什么重要的陈述或可靠的事实，这真够让人失望的。女人比男人穷，因为——这样那样的原因。也许现在最好放弃寻求真理，并轻而易举地接纳那一堆炙热如熔岩、暗淡如泔水的意见。最好把窗帘拉上，抛开一切分心的事，点上灯，缩小询问的范围，去请教记载客观事实而非主观意见的历史学家，让他们来形容女人在怎样的条件下生存，不必描写所有时代，只针对英国，比如说，在伊丽莎白时代。","It was disappointing not to have brought back in the evening some important statement, some authentic fact.Women are poorer than men because—this or that.Perhaps now it would be better to give up seeking for the truth, and receiving on one’s head an avalanche of opinion hot as lava, discoloured as dish-water.It would be better to draw the curtains; to shut out distractions; to light the lamp; to narrow the enquiry and to ask the historian, who records not opinions but facts, to describe under what conditions women lived, not throughout the ages, but in England, say, in the time of Elizabeth."
"因为这是一个始终未能解开的谜：为什么每两个男人中就有一个人能写诗歌或十四行诗，却没有一个女人为非凡的文学写出一字一句呢？那时女人的生存条件是什么样的呢？我问自己；因为小说是想象的作品，并不像科学一样，如一颗石子般落在地上。小说像一张蜘蛛网，也许总是很轻地依附，但四个角仍然都附着在生活上。很多时候人们几乎都察觉不出这种依附；譬如说，莎士比亚的戏剧似乎就完全靠自己悬在那里。不过，当蜘蛛网被拉歪，网边被钩住，中间被撕破时，人们才记起来，这些网并非是无形的动物在半空中所织，而是一些受苦的人们的作品，它们大体上附在物质的东西上，诸如健康、金钱和我们居住的房屋。","For it is a perennial puzzle why no woman wrote a word of that extraordinary literature when every other man, it seemed, was capable of song or sonnet.What were the conditions in which women lived?I asked myself; for fiction, imaginative work that is, is not dropped like a pebble upon the ground, as science may be; fiction is like a spider’s web, attached ever so lightly perhaps, but still attached to life at all four corners.Often the attachment is scarcely perceptible; Shakespeare’s plays, for instance, seem to hang there complete by themselves.But when the web is pulled askew, hooked up at the edge, torn in the middle, one remembers that these webs are not spun in mid-air by incorporeal creatures, but are the work of suffering human beings, and are attached to grossly material things, like health and money and the houses we live in."
"因此，我走近摆放历史书的书架，并拿下那本最近出版的特里维廉教授的《英国史》。我又一次查找“女人”一词，找到了“女人的地位”一栏，并翻到它所指的那一页。“打妻子”，我读道，“是男人公认的权利，不论地位高低，男人都打女人，且并不感到耻辱……同样，”历史家接着写道，“假使女儿拒绝跟父母选定的男人结婚，她就可能被关起来，在屋里被打来打去，而不会引起舆论的震惊。婚姻是不关乎个人情感的事情，而是关乎家庭贪婪的事，特别是在‘骑士时代’的上流社会中……往往男女中的一方或双方还在摇篮里的时候，他们就订婚了，还没有脱离保姆的照顾，就结婚了。”这些大概发生在一四七〇年，在乔叟时代结束后不久。下一次提到女人的地位则到了大约二百年后的斯图亚特时期。　“中上阶层的女人按照自己的意愿选择丈夫，仍然还是遭到反对的。一旦丈夫被指定，他就是君王、一家之主，至少在当时的法律习俗下是这样的。然而即便如此，”特里维廉教授推断说，“不论是莎士比亚笔下的女人，还是可靠的十七世纪回忆录中的女人——像弗尼夫妇回忆录和哈钦森夫妇回忆录，似乎都不缺乏个性和品格。”当然，如果我们这样考虑，克娄巴特拉肯定有她自己的风格；麦克白夫人，人们可以猜想，有自己的意愿；罗莎琳德，人们可以推断，是个迷人的姑娘。特里维廉教授评论说，莎士比亚作品里的女人似乎都不缺乏个性和品格，他讲的都是事实。虽非历史学家，人们也可以更进一步说：女人有史以来就如烽火般在所有诗人的所有作品里燃烧——剧作家笔下，有克吕泰墨斯特拉、安提戈涅、克娄巴特拉、麦克白夫人、费德尔、克雷西达、罗莎琳德、苔丝狄蒙娜和马尔菲公爵夫人；散文家笔下，有米勒芒特、克拉丽莎、贝姬·夏普、安娜·卡列尼娜、埃玛·包法利、盖芒特夫人——所有这些名字蜂拥至脑海中，却没有一个让人想起“缺乏个性和品格”的女人。确实，假如女人只存在于男人写的小说中的话，人们会把她们想象成极度重要的人，千姿百态，既英勇又吝啬，既光彩照人又自私贪婪，既美丽无双又奇丑无比，她们和男人一样伟大，有些人甚至认为她们比男人还要伟大。[5]但这只是小说中的女人。事实上，正如特里维廉教授指出的一样，她们被关起来，在屋子里被打来打去。","I went, therefore, to the shelf where the histories stand and took down one of the latest, Professor Trevelyan’s HISTORY OF ENGLAND.Once more I looked up Women, found ‘position of’ and turned to the pages indicated.‘Wife-beating’, I read, ‘was a recognized right of man, and was practised without shame by high as well as low.... Similarly,’ the historian goes on, ‘the daughter who refused to marry the gentleman of her parents’ choice was liable to be locked up, beaten and flung about the room, without any shock being inflicted on public opinion.Marriage was not an affair of personal affection, but of family avarice, particularly in the “chivalrous” upper classes....  Betrothal often took place while one or both of the parties was in the cradle, and marriage when they were scarcely out of the nurses’ charge.’That was about 1470, soon after Chaucer’s time.The next reference to the position of women is some two hundred years later, in the time of the Stuarts.‘It was still the exception for women of the upper and middle class to choose their own husbands, and when the husband had been assigned, he was lord and master, so far at least as law and custom could make him. Yet even so,’ Professor Trevelyan concludes, ‘neither Shakespeare’s women nor those of authentic seventeenth-century memoirs, like the Verneys and the Hutchinsons, seem wanting in personality and character.’ Certainly, if we consider it, Cleopatra must have had a way with her; Lady Macbeth, one would suppose, had a will of her own; Rosalind, one might conclude, was an attractive girl.Professor Trevelyan is speaking no more than the truth when he remarks that Shakespeare’s women do not seem wanting in personality and character.Not being a historian, one might go even further and say that women have burnt like beacons in all the works of all the poets from the beginning of time—Clytemnestra, Antigone, Cleopatra, Lady Macbeth, Phedre, Cressida, Rosalind, Desdemona, the Duchess of Malfi, among the dramatists; then among the prose writers: Millamant, Clarissa, Becky Sharp, Anna Karenina, Emma Bovary, Madame de Guermantes—the names flock to mind, nor do they recall women ‘lacking in personality and character.’ Indeed, if woman had no existence save in the fiction written by men, one would imagine her a person of the utmost importance; very various; heroic and mean; splendid and sordid; infinitely beautiful and hideous in the extreme; as great as a man, some think even greater. [5]But this is woman in fiction.In fact, as Professor Trevelyan points out, she was locked up, beaten and flung about the room."
"在这个世界上，现实生活中，一个体面的女人几乎不能独自在大街上露面，然而在舞台上，女人与男人不相上下，甚至更胜一筹，这种矛盾一直没有得到令人满意的解释。在现代悲剧中，女人拥有同样的优势。无论如何，对莎士比亚的作品作一个非常粗略的调查（韦伯斯特的作品也与此类似，但马洛或琼森的作品则不同），就足以显示出女人的这种支配地位和主动权是如何从罗莎琳德延续到麦克白夫人身上的。拉辛的作品也是如此，他的悲剧中有六部是以女主人公的名字命名的，他笔下的男性人物中，我们能拿谁和赫尔弥俄涅、安德罗玛克、贝雷妮丝、罗克珊、费德尔以及阿达莉作比较呢？还有易卜生也是如此，我们有什么男人能和索尔维格、诺拉、赫达、希尔达·旺格尔以及丽贝卡·韦斯特相配呢？”——F. L. 卢卡斯，《论悲剧》，第114—115页。","But the paradox of this world where in real life a respectable woman could hardly show her face alone in the street, and yet on the stage woman equals or surpasses man, has never been satisfactorily explained.In modern tragedy the same predominance exists.At all events, a very cursory survey of Shakespeare’s work (similarly with Webster, though not with Marlowe or Jonson) suffices to reveal how this dominance, this initiative of women, persists from Rosalind to Lady Macbeth.So too in Racine; six of his tragedies bear their heroines’ names; and what male characters of his shall we set against Hermione and Andromaque, Berenice and Roxane, Phedre and Athalie?So again with Ibsen; what men shall we match with Solveig and Nora, Heda and Hilda Wangel and Rebecca West?’—F. L. LUCAS, TRAGEDY, pp. 114-15."
"于是，一个很奇怪、集各种典型特点于一身的人出现了。想象中，她极为重要；实际上，她却完全无足轻重。她贯穿整个诗篇，却又在历史中缺席。她在小说里左右着帝王和征服者的一生，而事实上，只要一个男孩的父母强迫她戴上戒指，她就会成为这个男孩的奴隶。文学作品里，某些最有灵感的语言、某些最深刻的思想从她的嘴里说出来，而在现实生活中，她几乎不识字，也不能拼写，而且是她丈夫的财产。","A very queer, composite being thus emerges.Imaginatively she is of the highest importance; practically she is completely insignificant.She pervades poetry from cover to cover; she is all but absent from history.She dominates the lives of kings and conquerors in fiction; in fact she was the slave of any boy whose parents forced a ring upon her finger.Some of the most inspired words, some of the most profound thoughts in literature fall from her lips; in real life she could hardly read, could scarcely spell, and was the property of her husband."
"一个人读过历史又看了诗集后创作出来的女人必定是个奇特的怪物，就像一只虫子安上了鹰的翅膀，生命与美的精灵却在厨房里切板油。但是这些怪物，不管想象起来多么有趣，事实上是不存在的。若想让她生动形象，人们必须满怀诗意、同时又平淡地去思考，这样一方面不会脱离事实——她是马丁夫人，三十六岁，身穿蓝色衣服，头戴黑色帽子，脚穿棕色鞋，另一方面又不会忘记虚构——她是一件器皿，里面的各种锐气、力量在不停歇地流动、闪烁着。然而，人们一把这种方法用在伊丽莎白时代的女人身上，就无法阐明其中一方面，因为会被事实的匮乏所阻碍。关于她，人们不知道任何详细的、绝对真实的、实质性的事情。历史几乎没有提及她。我又向特里维廉教授求助，看看历史对他来说意味着什么。通过看他每章的题目，我发现历史意味着——","It was certainly an odd monster that one made up by reading the historians first and the poets afterwards a worm winged like an eagle; the spirit of life and beauty in a kitchen chopping up suet.But these monsters, however amusing to the imagination, have no existence in fact.What one must do to bring her to life was to think poetically and prosaically at one and the same moment, thus keeping in touch with fact—that she is Mrs Martin, aged thirty-six, dressed in blue, wearing a black hat and brown shoes; but not losing sight of fiction either—that she is a vessel in which all sorts of spirits and forces are coursing and flashing perpetually.The moment, however, that one tries this method with the Elizabethan woman, one branch of illumination fails; one is held up by the scarcity of facts.One knows nothing detailed, nothing perfectly true and substantial about her.History scarcely mentions her.And I turned to Professor Trevelyan again to see what history meant to him. I found by looking at his chapter headings that it meant—"
"“庄园宅第和露地农业的耕种方法……西多会修士和养羊业……十字军……大学……下议院……百年战争……玫瑰战争……文艺复兴时期的学者……寺院的瓦解……土地和宗教之争……英国海上霸权之缘由……西班牙无敌舰队……”等等。偶尔会提到一个女人，一个叫伊丽莎白的女人，或者一个叫玛丽的女人，一个女王或者一个贵妇。那些中产阶级妇女除了头脑和品格外便没有其他任何东西可以自由支配，她们是绝不可能参与任何伟大的运动的，而这些运动集聚起来就构成了历史学家对过去的看法。在趣闻轶事的集子里，我们也找不到她。奥布里几乎没有提到她。她从不写自己的生活，而且几乎不写日记；现存的只有她的几封信。她没留下任何可供我们对她作出评价的戏剧或诗歌。我想，人们所需要的是大量的信息：她们多大年龄结婚？她们通常有几个孩子？她们的房子怎样？有没有属于她们自己的房间？她们自己做不做饭，有没有可能雇佣仆人——可是为何在纽纳姆或戈廷没有某个才华横溢的学生提供这些信息呢？所有这些事实都位于某个地方，可能是记载在教区登记簿和账簿上；伊丽莎白时代的普通女人的生活肯定散落在什么地方，如果有人能够把它收集起来，就能编成一本书。在书架上找寻并不在架上的书时，我想，建议那些名牌大学的学生重写历史会很费力，而且也是我的胆量所不及的，虽然我承认历史似乎经常有些奇怪，有些不真实、不平衡；不过他们为什么不应该给历史补遗呢？给它一个不引人注目（这是当然了）的名字，这样，女人可以在其中出现而又不至于不得体。在伟大人物的传记中，人们常常会瞥见她们，她们很快地消失在背景中。有时我想，她们隐藏了一个眼色、一声大笑，也许是一滴泪珠。毕竟，简·奥斯汀的传记已经够多了，似乎也不太需要再考虑乔安娜·贝利的悲剧对埃德加·爱伦·坡的诗有什么影响；对我而言，如果玛丽·拉塞尔·米特福德的房屋和她常去的地方至少有一百年都不对外开放，我也不会在乎。当我环视书架继续寻思时，我发现，人们对于十八世纪以前的女人一无所知，这真是可悲。我脑海中竟没有可以让我这样那样反复思考的例子。我要问的是，为什么在伊丽莎白时代女人都不写诗，而且我也不清楚，她们是怎么接受教育的，有没有人教她们写字，她们有没有自己的起居室，多少女人在二十一岁之前就有了孩子，总之，她们从早上八点至晚上八点都做什么。显然，她们没有钱；按照特里维廉教授的说法，不管她们愿不愿意，她们没出育婴室就嫁人了，很可能在十五六岁时就结婚了。最后我的结论是，仅由这一点就能看出，要是她们中有人突然写出了莎士比亚的戏剧，那就太奇怪了。我想起了那位现已过世、但曾做过主教的老先生，记得他曾经说过，任何一个女人，不论是在过去、现在，还是将来，都不会具有莎士比亚那样的天赋。他给报纸写文章阐述了这一看法。他还告诉一位向他咨询的女士，事实上猫是进不了天堂的，尽管——他补充道——它们也有某种灵魂。这些老先生花了多少心思来拯救人们啊！他们一走近，愚昧的边界就收缩了多少啊！猫进不了天堂。女人写不出莎士比亚的戏剧。","‘The Manor Court and the Methods of Open-field Agriculture... The Cistercians and Sheep-farming... The Crusades... The University... The House of Commons... The Hundred Years’ War... The Wars of the Roses... The Renaissance Scholars... The Dissolution of the Monasteries... Agrarian and Religious Strife... The Origin of English Sea-power... The Armada...’ and so on. Occasionally an individual woman is mentioned, an Elizabeth, or a Mary; a queen or a great lady.But by no possible means could middle-class women with nothing but brains and character at their command have taken part in any one of the great movements which, brought together, constitute the historian’s view of the past.Nor shall we find her in collection of anecdotes.Aubrey hardly mentions her.She never writes her own life and scarcely keeps a diary; there are only a handful of her letters in existence.She left no plays or poems by which we can judge her.What one wants, I thought—and why does not some brilliant student at Newnham or Girton supply it?—is a mass of information; at what age did she marry; how many children had she as a rule; what was her house like, had she a room to herself; did she do the cooking; would she be likely to have a servant?All these facts lie somewhere, presumably, in parish registers and account books; the life of the average Elizabethan woman must be scattered about somewhere, could one collect it and make a book of it.It would be ambitious beyond my daring, I thought, looking about the shelves for books that were not there, to suggest to the students of those famous colleges that they should rewrite history, though I own that it often seems a little queer as it is, unreal, lop-sided; but why should they not add a supplement to history, calling it, of course, by some inconspicuous name so that women might figure there without impropriety?For one often catches a glimpse of them in the lives of the great, whisking away into the background, concealing, I sometimes think, a wink, a laugh, perhaps a tear.And, after all, we have lives enough of Jane Austen; it scarcely seems necessary to consider again the influence of the tragedies of Joanna Baillie upon the poetry of Edgar Allan Poe; as for myself, I should not mind if the homes and haunts of Mary Russell Mitford were closed to the public for a century at least.But what I find deplorable, I continued, looking about the bookshelves again, is that nothing is known about women before the eighteenth century.I have no model in my mind to turn about this way and that.Here am I asking why women did not write poetry in the Elizabethan age, and I am not sure how they were educated; whether they were taught to write; whether they had sitting-rooms to themselves; how many women had children before they were twenty-one; what, in short, they did from eight in the morning till eight at night.They had no money evidently; according to Professor Trevelyan they were married whether they liked it or not before they were out of the nursery, at fifteen or sixteen very likely.It would have been extremely odd, even upon this showing, had one of them suddenly written the plays of Shakespeare, I concluded, and I thought of that old gentleman, who is dead now, but was a bishop, I think, who declared that it was impossible for any woman, past, present, or to come, to have the genius of Shakespeare.He wrote to the papers about it.He also told a lady who applied to him for information that cats do not as a matter of fact go to heaven, though they have, he added, souls of a sort.How much thinking those old gentlemen used to save one!How the borders of ignorance shrank back at their approach!Cats do not go to heaven.Women cannot write the plays of Shakespeare."
"可能实际上就是如此吧，看着书架上莎士比亚的作品，我不禁想，那位主教至少在这一点上是对的。任何女人在莎士比亚时期都不可能写出莎士比亚的戏剧，完全、彻底不可能。既然难以获得事实的依据，那就让我想象一下，假使莎士比亚有一个拥有非凡天赋的妹妹，就叫她朱迪思吧，会发生什么事情呢？莎士比亚自己很可能上过文法学校——他的母亲是个女继承人，在那里他应该学过拉丁文——奥维德、维吉尔、贺拉斯——以及文法和逻辑基础。众所周知，他是个很难约束的孩子，偷猎兔子，也许还射过鹿，远不到结婚的年龄就不得不跟附近的一个女人结了婚，那个女人给他生了个孩子，而生产的时间远远早于正常的时间。这些越轨行为逼他到伦敦去寻找发迹的机会。他似乎对戏院感兴趣，于是开始在剧场后门替人牵马。不久他就在戏院谋了份工作，成了一名成功的演员，并住在世界的中心，见过每一个人，认识每一个人，在舞台上运用他的演技，在街道上演练他的机智，甚至进入了女王的宫殿。同时让我们假设，他那有非凡天赋的妹妹一直呆在家里。她和他一样爱冒险、富有想像力，和他一样渴望了解世界。但是她没有上过学。她没有学习文法和逻辑的机会，更不用说读贺拉斯和维吉尔的作品了。她偶尔会拿起一本书读上几页，可能是她哥哥的书吧。但是接着她父母就会进来，告诉她要补袜子，或者让她照看炖着的菜，而不让她在那里看书读报懒散度日。他们说这些话时，语气很严厉却又很慈爱，因为他们很富裕，知道女人的生活条件而且爱他们的女儿——的确，极有可能她是她父亲的掌上明珠。也许她偷偷地在堆苹果的阁楼上涂写过几页诗文，不过会小心地把它们藏起来或者烧掉。可是不久，在她还不满二十岁时，她就被许配给了邻近一个羊毛商的儿子。她哭喊着说她讨厌结婚，并且因为这个遭了父亲的一顿毒打。之后父亲不再责骂她。他转而恳求她不要伤他的心，不要在结婚这件事上丢他的脸。他说要给她一串珠链，或者一件精美的裙子，他的眼里含着泪水。她怎么可以违背他的意愿？她怎么可以伤他的心？自身的天赋的力量驱使她违背了父亲的意愿。她把她的行李打成了一个小包裹，在一个夏天的晚上顺着一根绳子滑下楼，启程去往伦敦。那时她不满十七岁。树篱中鸟儿的鸣唱都未必有她唱得动听。她对语言的语调有着最敏锐的想象力——像她哥哥一样的天赋。她也像哥哥一样对戏剧感兴趣。她站在剧院的后门口，说自己想演戏，男人们当着她的面笑了起来。经理——一个爱饶舌的胖男人——哈哈大笑起来。他大喊大叫了一些关于鬈毛狗跳舞和女人表演的事——说女人不可能当演员。他暗示——你能想象他暗示了什么。她不会得到任何技能训练。她甚至会在小酒馆乞求别人施舍给她饭菜，或是半夜在街头徘徊吗？然而她具备写小说的天赋，而且渴望从男男女女的生活以及对他们的习惯的研究中汲取大量素材。最后——因为她很年轻，说也奇怪，她的脸很像诗人莎士比亚，有着同样的灰色的眼睛和弯弯的眉毛——最后演员经理尼克·格林可怜她；她发现自己怀了这个绅士的孩子，所以——当诗人的心被囚禁、纠缠在一个女人的身体中时，谁能估量它的激情和狂热呢——她在一个冬夜里自杀了，被埋在某个十字路口，就是现在“大象和堡垒”酒店外停靠公共汽车的地方。","Be that as it may, I could not help thinking, as I looked at the works of Shakespeare on the shelf, that the bishop was right at least in this; it would have been impossible, completely and entirely, for any woman to have written the plays of Shakespeare in the age of Shakespeare.Let me imagine, since facts are so hard to come by, what would have happened had Shakespeare had a wonderfully gifted sister, called Judith, let us say. Shakespeare himself went, very probably,—his mother was an heiress—to the grammar school, where he may have learnt Latin—Ovid, Virgil and Horace—and the elements of grammar and logic.He was, it is well known, a wild boy who poached rabbits, perhaps shot a deer, and had, rather sooner than he should have done, to marry a woman in the neighbourhood, who bore him a child rather quicker than was right.That escapade sent him to seek his fortune in London.He had, it seemed, a taste for the theatre; he began by holding horses at the stage door.Very soon he got work in the theatre, became a successful actor, and lived at the hub of the universe, meeting everybody, knowing everybody, practising his art on the boards, exercising his wits in the streets, and even getting access to the palace of the queen.Meanwhile his extraordinarily gifted sister, let us suppose, remained at home.She was as adventurous, as imaginative, as agog to see the world as he was.But she was not sent to school.She had no chance of learning grammar and logic, let alone of reading Horace and Virgil.She picked up a book now and then, one of her brother’s perhaps, and read a few pages.But then her parents came in and told her to mend the stockings or mind the stew and not moon about with books and papers.They would have spoken sharply but kindly, for they were substantial people who knew the conditions of life for a woman and loved their daughter—indeed, more likely than not she was the apple of her father’s eye. Perhaps she scribbled some pages up in an apple loft on the sly but was careful to hide them or set fire to them.Soon, however, before she was out of her teens, she was to be betrothed to the son of a neighbouring woolstapler.She cried out that marriage was hateful to her, and for that she was severely beaten by her father.Then he ceased to scold her.He begged her instead not to hurt him, not to shame him in this matter of her marriage.He would give her a chain of beads or a fine petticoat, he said; and there were tears in his eyes.How could she disobey him?How could she break his heart?The force of her own gift alone drove her to it.She made up a small parcel of her belongings, let herself down by a rope one summer’s night and took the road to London.She was not seventeen.The birds that sang in the hedge were not more musical than she was.She had the quickest fancy, a gift like her brother’s, for the tune of words.Like him, she had a taste for the theatre.She stood at the stage door; she wanted to act, she said.Men laughed in her face.The manager—a fat, looselipped man—guffawed.He bellowed something about poodles dancing and women acting—no woman, he said, could possibly be an actress.He hinted—you can imagine what.She could get no training in her craft.Could she even seek her dinner in a tavern or roam the streets at midnight?Yet her genius was for fiction and lusted to feed abundantly upon the lives of men and women and the study of their ways.At last—for she was very young, oddly like Shakespeare the poet in her face, with the same grey eyes and rounded brows—at last Nick Greene the actormanager took pity on her; she found herself with child by that gentleman and so—who shall measure the heat and violence of the poet’s heart when caught and tangled in a woman’s body?—killed herself one winter’s night and lies buried at some cross-roads where the omnibuses now stop outside the Elephant and Castle."
"我想，莎士比亚时期如果有一个女人具备莎士比亚的天赋，那么她的故事大概就是这样的吧。然而对我来说，我同意那位已逝的主教（假若他是主教的话）的看法——在莎士比亚时期，有哪个女人能具有莎士比亚的天赋是不可思议的。因为莎士比亚那样的天赋是不会在辛苦劳作、未受教育、做奴仆的人们中诞生的。它不会在英国的撒克逊人和布立吞人中诞生。它也不会在现如今的工人阶级中诞生。那么它又怎么会在那些妇女中诞生呢？她们的工作，按照特里维廉教授所说，差不多在她们还未出育婴室就开始了，她们受父母的逼迫从事这样的工作，并且被习俗和法律的所有力量约束在这个工作中。然而，某种天赋肯定在女人中存在过，正如它肯定在工人阶级中存在过一样。偶尔会有一个埃米莉·勃朗特？或者一个罗伯特·彭斯光芒四射，证实了天赋的存在。不过当然，这种天赋从不曾诉诸于纸上。然而，当人们读到一个女巫被人们所回避，读到一个女人着了魔，读到一个聪明女人卖草药，甚至读到一个出众的人有位母亲，我就会想到，我们正追随一位失落的小说家，一位被压抑的诗人，某位沉默而又不出名的简·奥斯汀，某位在荒野中撞破头或因受自己才能的折磨而使她在公路上扮鬼脸的埃米莉·勃朗特。确实，我大胆地猜测那些写了很多诗而又不署名的无名氏常常是女人。我想，这令人想到女爱德华·菲茨杰拉德，她创作出民歌和民谣，低声哼唱给她的孩子们，以此消磨纺线的时光或者度过漫漫冬夜。","That, more or less, is how the story would run, I think, if a woman in Shakespeare’s day had had Shakespeare’s genius.But for my part, I agree with the deceased bishop, if such he was—it is unthinkable that any woman in Shakespeare’s day should have had Shakespeare’s genius.For genius like Shakespeare’s is not born among labouring, uneducated, servile people.It was not born in England among the Saxons and the Britons.It is not born today among the working classes.How, then, could it have been born among women whose work began, according to Professor Trevelyan, almost before they were out of the nursery, who were forced to it by their parents and held to it by all the power of law and custom?Yet genius of a sort must have existed among women as it must have existed among the working classes.Now and again an Emily Bront? or a Robert Burns blazes out and proves its presence.But certainly it never got itself on to paper.When, however, one reads of a witch being ducked, of a woman possessed by devils, of a wise woman selling herbs, or even of a very remarkable man who had a mother, then I think we are on the track of a lost novelist, a suppressed poet, of some mute and inglorious Jane Austen, some Emily Bront who dashed her brains out on the moor or mopped and mowed about the highways crazed with the torture that her gift had put her to.Indeed, I would venture to guess that Anon, who wrote so many poems without signing them, was often a woman.It was a woman Edward Fitzgerald, I think, suggested who made the ballads and the folk-songs, crooning them to her children, beguiling her spinning with them, or the length of the winter’s night."
"这可能是真的也可能是假的——谁能说得清呢？不过回想了一下上面编的莎士比亚的妹妹的故事，我觉得，这里面有一点是真实的，就是十六世纪任何一个有伟大天赋的女人都无一例外地会发狂、自杀，或者在村外孤寂的小屋里终其一生，半是女巫，半是术士，既为人所畏惧，又为人所嘲笑。因为只要懂一点心理学就能确信，一个极有天赋的女孩想用才华写诗会遭到其他人的反对和阻止，她自己相互矛盾的本能也会使她饱受折磨、几乎被撕裂，因此，她必定会失去健康和理智。没有女孩能够走到伦敦，站在剧场后门口，并且不遭到强暴、不忍受痛苦就能闯到戏院经理面前。这种痛苦可能不够理性——因为贞洁大概只是某些社会为一些不为人知的理由而发明的一种供膜拜的东西——然而却是不可避免的。在那时，甚至在现在，贞洁在女人的生活中具有一种宗教上的重要性，而且它被神经和本能紧紧裹住，以至于想要割开这些东西、给它自由、把它带到阳光之下需要极为罕见的勇气。在十六世纪的伦敦，过一种自由的生活对一个既是诗人又是剧作家的女人来说，是一种精神压力，一种进退两难的困境，这很可能会要了她的命。就算她能活下来，她创作的任何作品也都是扭曲、畸形的，都是在那种紧张、病态的想象中产生的。我看着那个书架，上面没有放置女人写的戏剧，我想，毫无疑问她的作品不会署名。她肯定会寻求那样的避难所。甚至直至十九世纪，这种贞操观念的遗毒仍然让女人匿名写作。柯勒·贝尔、乔治·艾略特、乔治·桑，正如她们的作品所证明的一样，都是内心的冲突的受害者。她们试图用男人的名字来掩饰自己，但却并未奏效。这样一来，她们就给习俗致了敬，这种习俗——即女人引起公众注意是令人厌恶的——即使不是男人灌输的，也是他们大力鼓励的（伯里克利说一个女人最首要的荣耀就是不被人谈论，而他自己却是人们经常谈论的一个人）。隐姓埋名是她们血液中的一部分。隐蔽自己的愿望仍然支配着她们。甚至在现在，女人也不像男人那样关心自己的名望。一般来说，她们在走过墓碑或指示牌时，都不会有想要把她们的名字刻上去的强烈欲望，而像阿尔夫、伯特或蔡斯就不同，他们会服从他们的本能。这种本能在看见一个漂亮的女人或者甚至是一条狗经过时，会低声说：这条狗是我的。当然，也许不是一条狗，我想道，记起了议会广场、西吉斯林阴道和其他林阴道；也可能是一块地或者一个长着黑色卷发的男人。可是作为女人的一个好处就是，她可以从一个漂亮的女黑人身边走过而不想把她变成英国女人。","This may be true or it may be false—who can say?—but what is true in it, so it seemed to me, reviewing the story of Shakespeare’s sister as I had made it, is that any woman born with a great gift in the sixteenth century would certainly have gone crazed, shot herself, or ended her days in some lonely cottage outside the village, half witch, half wizard, feared and mocked at.For it needs little skill in psychology to be sure that a highly gifted girl who had tried to use her gift for poetry would have been so thwarted and hindered by other people, so tortured and pulled asunder by her own contrary instincts, that she must have lost her health and sanity to a certainty.No girl could have walked to London and stood at a stage door and forced her way into the presence of actor-managers without doing herself a violence and suffering an anguish which may have been irrational—for chastity may be a fetish invented by certain societies for unknown reasons—but were nonetheless inevitable.Chastity had then, it has even now, a religious importance in a woman’s life, and has so wrapped itself round with nerves and instincts that to cut it free and bring it to the light of day demands courage of the rarest.To have lived a free life in London in the six teenth century would have meant for a woman who was poet and playwright a nervous stress and dilemma which might well have killed her.Had she survived, whatever she had written would have been twisted and deformed, issuing from a strained and morbid imagination.And undoubtedly, I thought, looking at the shelf where there are no plays by women, her work would have gone unsigned.That refuge she would have sought certainly.It was the relic of the sense of chastity that dictated anonymity to women even so late as the nineteenth century.Currer Bell, George Eliot, George Sand, all the victims of inner strife as their writings prove, sought ineffectively to veil themselves by using the name of a man.Thus they did homage to the convention, which if not implanted by the other sex was liberally encouraged by them (the chief glory of a woman is not to be talked of, said Pericles, himself a much-talked-of man) that publicity in women is detestable.Anonymity runs in their blood.The desire to be veiled still possesses them.They are not even now as concerned about the health of their fame as men are, and, speaking generally, will pass a tombstone or a signpost without feeling an irresistible desire to cut their names on it, as Alf, Bert or Chas. must do in obedience to their instinct, which murmurs if it sees a fine woman go by, or even a dog, Ce chien est a moi. And, of course, it may not be a dog, I thought, remembering Parliament Square, the Sieges Allee and other avenues; it may be a piece of land or a man with curly black hair. It is one of the great advantages of being a woman that one can pass even a very fine negress without wishing to make an Englishwoman of her."
"这么说来，十六世纪生来就具有作诗天赋的女人是一个不快乐的女人，是一个跟自己作斗争的女人。她的所有生活条件、所有本能都与她的心境相冲突，而要释放脑子里的任何东西都需要这种心境。但是什么样的心境对创作行为最有帮助呢？我问道。人们可以了解促进、促成那个奇怪活动的心境吗？这时我打开了包含莎士比亚悲剧的那卷书。比方说，莎士比亚是在什么样的心境下写的《李尔王》和《安东尼和克莱奥帕特》呢？那肯定是迄今为止最有益于写诗的心境。不过莎士比亚自己并没有提及。我们只是意外地知道他“从未曾涂去一行”。实际上，可能直到十八世纪，艺术家才提到自己的心境。大概是从卢梭开始的。无论如何，到十九世纪时，自我意识已发展到一定程度，以至于以忏悔录和自传的形式来描述自己的心境成了文人的习惯。他们也描写自己的生活，并且他们的信件在他们死后被出版。所以，虽然我们不知道莎士比亚在写《李尔王》时经历了什么，但是我们知道卡莱尔在写《法国革命》时经历了什么，知道福楼拜写《包法利夫人》时经历了什么，知道济慈在写诗反抗即将来临的死亡和世情淡漠的世界时经历了什么。","That woman, then, who was born with a gift of poetry in the sixteenth century, was an unhappy woman, a woman at strife against herself.All the conditions of her life, all her own instincts, were hostile to the state of mind which is needed to set free whatever is in the brain.But what is the state of mind that is most propitious to the act of creation? I asked.Can one come by any notion of the state that furthers and makes possible that strange activity?Here I opened the volume containing the Tragedies of Shakespeare.What was Shakespeare’s state of mind, for instance, when he wrote LEAR and ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA?It was certainly the state of mind most favourable to poetry that there has ever existed.But Shakespeare himself said nothing about it.We only know casually and by chance that he ‘never blotted a line’.Nothing indeed was ever said by the artist himself about his state of mind until the eighteenth century perhaps.Rousseau perhaps began it.At any rate, by the nineteenth century selfconsciousness had developed so far that it was the habit for men of letters to describe their minds in confessions and autobiographies.Their lives also were written, and their letters were printed after their deaths.Thus, though we do not know what Shakespeare went through when he wrote LEAR, we do know what Carlyle went through when he wrote the FRENCH REVOLUTION; what Flaubert went through when he wrote MADAME BOVARY; what Keats was going through when he tried to write poetry against the coming death and the indifference of the world."
"从大量的关于忏悔和自我分析的现代文学作品里我们可以得出，写一部天才级的著作差不多总是一项极困难的壮举。种种迹象表明，这样的著作不可能完完全全从作家的脑子里诞生。物质环境一般不允许如此。狗会叫；人会来打扰；要想着赚钱；身体会垮掉。此外，加重这些困难、使其更加难以难忍的是这个世界臭名昭著的冷漠。这个世界不要求人们写诗歌、小说或是历史；它不需要这些。这个世界根本不在乎福楼拜是否用了恰当的词，或卡莱尔是否缜密地证实了这个或那个事实。自然，它不会在它不需要的东西上付出什么。所以，济慈、福楼拜、卡莱尔等作家经历了各种分心的事情和令人沮丧的挫折，特别在年轻时的创作时期里？一种诅咒、一种痛苦的呼声从那些分析和忏悔的书里面发出来。“伟大的诗人在痛苦中死去”，这是他们吟唱的主题。假如有什么著作历经这些而最终完成了，那简直是奇迹，恐怕没有一本书能完整无缺地照作者的设想写出来。","And one gathers from this enormous modern literature of confession and self-analysis that to write a work of genius is almost always a feat of prodigious difficulty.Everything is against the likelihood that it will come from the writer’s mind whole and entire.Generally material circumstances are against it.Dogs will bark; people will interrupt; money must be made; health will break down.Further, accentuating all these difficulties and making them harder to bear is the world’s notorious indifference.It does not ask people to write poems and novels and histories; it does not need them.It does not care whether Flaubert finds the right word or whether Carlyle scrupulously verifies this or that fact.Naturally, it will not pay for what it does not want.And so the writer, Keats, Flaubert, Carlyle, suffers, especially in the creative years of youth, every form of distraction and discouragement.A curse, a cry of agony, rises from those books of analysis and confession.‘Mighty poets in their misery dead’—that is the burden of their song.If anything comes through in spite of all this, it is a miracle, and probably no book is born entire and uncrippled as it was conceived."
"我看着空空的书架，心想，但是对于女人，这种种困难更是极其可怕。首先，拥有一个自己的房间都不可能，更不必说一个安静、隔音的房间了，除非她父母特别富有或者特别高贵。甚至一直到十九世纪初期，都还是这种状况。因为依赖父亲的好意所得的零花钱只够她穿衣蔽体，甚至连济慈、丁尼生、卡莱尔那样的穷男人可以得到的慰藉她都得不到，比如徒步旅行，去法国旅游一下，比如有单独的住所——即使这样的住所非常简陋，也可以使他们避开家庭的要求和专制。这类物质上的困难已经够可怕了，可是更糟的还有非物质的困难。济慈、福楼拜及其他天才难以忍受的世情冷漠，对女人来说，就不是冷漠而是敌视了。世人对她所说的话，并不像对他们说的那样：你想写什么就写什么，这和我不相干。世人放声大笑：写作？你写作有什么用处？再看看书架上的空地方，我想，纽纳姆和戈廷的心理学家现在可以来帮帮我们的忙了。现在确实是时候量量挫折对艺术家的思想产生多大影响了。有一次我看到一个乳制品公司测试普通牛奶和甲等牛奶对老鼠身体的影响有何不同，他们把两只老鼠并排放在笼子里，一只鬼鬼祟祟、胆子很小、个头也小，另一只皮毛光亮、大胆而且也有个头。现在想想我们拿些什么东西给有艺术天赋的女人吃呢？我问道。我想我记起了李子和蛋奶糕那一餐。要回答这个问题，我只需要打开晚报读读伯肯黑德勋爵的想法——不过其实我并不想费神把他对女人写作这件事的想法抄下来。英奇副主教说的话我不去惊动。哈莱街的专家可以纵情呼喊以激起街上的回声，我丝毫也不会被惊动。但是我要引用奥斯卡·勃朗宁先生的话，因为他曾是剑桥的大人物，而且曾担任过戈廷及纽纳姆一带的学生的考官。奥斯卡·勃朗宁先生常常宣称：“阅过任何一套考卷后，撇开他可能给的分数不管，他的印象都是最优秀的女人的智力还不如最糟的男人高。”说完这些话后，勃朗宁先生回到自己的房间——正是这个随之而来的事使他受到众人爱戴，成了众人心目中伟大威严的人——他回到自己的房间里，看见一个小马倌躺在沙发上——“简直是一副骨架，双颊深陷而又呈灰黄色，牙齿很黑，而且四肢看上去也不是很健全。‘那是阿瑟’（勃朗宁先生说），‘他真是很可爱，并且是最为思想崇高的孩子。’”这两幅图画在我看来总是相辅相成的。很幸运，在这个传记的时代，这两幅画面确实常常相辅相成，这样我们在解释大人物的意见时，不仅可以依据他们所说的话，还可以参照他们所做的事。","But for women, I thought, looking at the empty shelves, these difficulties were infinitely more formidable.In the first place, to have a room of her own, let alone a quiet room or a sound-proof room, was out of the question, unless her parents were exceptionally rich or very noble, even up to the beginning of the nineteenth century.Since her pin money, which depended on the goodwill of her father, was only enough to keep her clothed, she was debarred from such alleviations as came even to Keats or Tennyson or Carlyle, all poor men, from a walking tour, a little journey to France, from the separate lodging which, even if it were miserable enough, sheltered them from the claims and tyrannies of their families.Such material difficulties were formidable; but much worse were the immaterial.The indifference of the world which Keats and Flaubert and other men of genius have found so hard to bear was in her case not indifference but hostility.The world did not say to her as it said to them, write if you choose; it makes no difference to me.The world said with a guffaw, Write?What’s the good of your writing?Here the psychologists of Newnham and Girton might come to our help, I thought, looking again at the blank spaces on the shelves.For surely it is time that the effect of discouragement upon the mind of the artist should be measured, as I have seen a dairy company measure the effect of ordinary milk and Grade A milk upon the body of the rat. They set two rats in cages side by side, and of the two one was furtive, timid and small, and the other was glossy, bold and big. Now what food do we feed women as artists upon? I asked, remembering, I suppose, that dinner of prunes and custard.To answer that question I had only to open the evening paper and to read that Lord Birkenhead is of opinion—but really I am not going to trouble to copy out Lord Birkenhead’s opinion upon the writing of women.What Dean Inge says I will leave in peace.The Harley Street specialist may be allowed to rouse the echoes of Harley Street with his vociferations without raising a hair on my head.I will quote, however, Mr Oscar Browning, because Mr Oscar Browning was a great figure in Cambridge at one time, and used to examine the students at Girton and Newnham.Mr Oscar Browning was wont to declare ‘that the impression left on his mind, after looking over any set of examination papers, was that, irrespective of the marks he might give, the best woman was intellectually the inferior of the worst man’.After saying that Mr Browning went back to his rooms—and it is this sequel that endears him and makes him a human figure of some bulk and majesty—he went back to his rooms and found a stable-boy lying on the sofa—‘a mere skeleton, his cheeks were cavernous and sallow, his teeth were black, and he did not appear to have the full use of his limbs.“That’s Arthur” [said Mr Browning].“He’s a dear boy really and most high-minded.”’—The two pictures always seem to me to complete each other.And happily in this age of biography the two pictures often do complete each other, so that we are able to interpret the opinions of great men not only by what they say, but by what they do."
"虽然现在能够这样做了，但是这些意见从重要的人嘴里说出来一定是很可怕的，甚至在五十年前也是如此。让我们设想，一个父亲出于最高尚的目的，不愿他的女儿离家去做作家、画家，或是学者。他会说，“看奥斯卡·勃朗宁说什么来着。”还不止奥斯卡·勃朗宁先生呢，还有《星期六评论》，还有格雷格先生——格雷格先生强调说，“一个女人生存的要诀就是男人赡养她们而她们侍奉男人”，还有一大堆男人的意见，大意是说，在智力上不能对女人抱有任何期望。即使父亲没有大声宣读这些意见，任何女孩也都能自己读；阅读这些，甚至在十九世纪，也必然会减少她的活力而且深深地影响她的工作。永远有这样的断言——你不能做这个，也做不了那个——需要被抗议、被克服。大概这个病菌对小说家不会再有多大的影响了，因为已经有了一些很优秀的女小说家。而对于画家，它肯定还在起一些作用；对于音乐家，我能想象到，它甚至在现在都极其活跃，毒性极大。女作曲家现在的地位，就相当于莎士比亚时代女演员的地位。回想我编的那个莎士比亚妹妹的故事，我想到尼克·格林曾说过，女人演戏使他联想到狗跳舞。二百年后的约翰逊在说女子布道时重复过这句话。在这儿我打开一本关于音乐的书，说道，在这体面的一年，一九二八年，我们又引用了这几个字来形容尝试作曲的女人。对于热尔梅娜·塔耶费尔小姐，只能重复约翰逊先生谈论一个女传教士时用的格言，不过是换成了音乐术语的形式。“先生，一个女人作曲就像一只狗用后腿走路。走得不怎么样，但你还是能惊奇地发现它居然在走。” [6] 历史竟如此丝毫不差地重演。","But though this is possible now, such opinions coming from the lips of important people must have been formidable enough even fifty years ago. Let us suppose that a father from the highest motives did not wish his daughter to leave home and become writer, painter or scholar.‘See what Mr Oscar Browning says,’he would say; and there so was not only Mr Oscar Browning; there was the SATURDAY REVIEW; there was Mr Greg—the ‘essentials of a woman’s being’, said Mr Greg emphatically, ‘are that THEY ARE SUPPORTED BY, AND THEY MINISTER TO, MEN’—there was an enormous body of masculine opinion to the effect that nothing could be expected of women intellectually.Even if her father did not read out loud these opinions, any girl could read them for herself; and the reading, even in the nineteenth century, must have lowered her vitality, and told profoundly upon her work.There would always have been that assertion—you cannot do this, you are incapable of doing that—to protest against, to overcome.Probably for a novelist this germ is no longer of much effect; for there have been women novelists of merit.But for painters it must still have some sting in it; and for musicians, I imagine, is even now active and poisonous in the extreme.The woman composer stands where the actress stood in the time of Shakespeare.Nick Greene, I thought, remembering the story I had made about Shakespeare’s sister, said that a woman acting put him in mind of a dog dancing.Johnson repeated the phrase two hundred years later of women preaching.And here, I said, opening a book about music, we have the very words used again in this year of grace, 1928, of women who try to write music.Of Mlle Germaine Tailleferre one can only repeat Dr Johnson’s dictum concerning, a woman preacher, transposed into terms of music.“Sir, a woman’s composing is like a dog’s walking on his hind legs.It is not done well, but you are surprised to find it done at all.”[6] So accurately does history repeat itself."
"因此，不去管奥斯卡·勃朗宁先生的生活，把剩下的也抛开不讲，我的结论是：十分明显，甚至在十九世纪，也不提倡女人成为艺术家。相反，她遭到冷落、侮辱、训斥和规劝。她的脑子一定会因为需要反对这个、反驳那个而变得紧张，她的活力也会因此削减。现在我们再回到那个非常有趣而又模糊、深刻影响女人行为活动的男人情结；那种根深蒂固的欲望，与其说要女人低下，不如说要男人优越；男人的这种心理使他们无处不在——不论人们看向哪里，他们挡在艺术的前面，拦住从政的道路，即使对他们来说风险微乎其微、请求他们的人谦恭且忠诚时也是如此。我想起，甚至连贝斯伯勒夫人那样对政治极其热衷的女人都得谦卑地弯下腰来，写信给格兰维尔·莱维森—高尔勋爵：“……尽管我对政治很热衷，也在这个话题上发表过很多言论，但我完全赞同你的看法，即女人不应干预政治及其他严肃的事，最多可以发表一下她的意见（假如有人问她的话)。”于是她继续在那个极其重要的话题——格兰维尔勋爵在下议院的首次演讲——上消耗着她的热情，在那里她的热情没有受到任何阻碍。我想，这种现象确实很奇怪。男人反对妇女解放的历史或许比妇女解放的故事本身还要有趣。如果在戈廷或纽纳姆有某个年轻学生愿意搜集这类例子，继而演绎出一个理论，那么就可以撰写一部很有趣的书——不过她会需要戴一副厚手套，还需要栏杆，以保护纯洁高尚的自己。","Thus, I concluded, shutting Mr Oscar Browning’s life and pushing away the rest, it is fairly evident that even in the nineteenth century a woman was not encouraged to be an artist.On the contrary, she was snubbed, slapped, lectured and exhorted.Her mind must have been strained and her vitality lowered by the need of opposing this, of disproving that.For here again we come within range of that very interesting and obscure masculine complex which has had so much influence upon the woman’s movement; that deepseated desire, not so much that SHE shall be inferior as that HE shall be superior, which plants him wherever one looks, not only in front of the arts, but barring the way to politics too, even when the risk to himself seems infinitesimal and the suppliant humble and devoted.Even Lady Bessborough, I remembered, with all her passion for politics, must humbly bow herself and write to Lord Granville Leveson-Gower: ‘... notwithstanding all my violence in politics and talking so much on that subject, I perfectly agree with you that no woman has any business to meddle with that or any other serious business, farther than giving her opinion (if she is ask’d).’ And so she goes on to spend her enthusiasm where it meets with no obstacle whatsoever, upon that immensely important subject, Lord Granville’s maiden speech in the House of Commons.The spectacle is certainly a strange one, I thought.The history of men’s opposition to women’s emancipation is more interesting perhaps than the story of that emancipation itself.An amusing book might be made of it if some young student at Girton or Newnham would collect examples and deduce a theory,—but she would need thick gloves on her hands, and bars to protect her of solid gold."
"不过，合上贝斯伯勒夫人的书，我想起，现在被认为有趣的事，曾一度需要极认真地对待。那些被贴进一本荒唐无稽的书中、等待夏日的夜晚读给优秀的听众听的意见，我向你们保证，曾经让人热泪盈眶。你们的祖母和曾祖母中就曾有许多人哭得死去活来。费洛伦斯·南丁格尔沉浸在痛苦中大声嘶喊。[7]再者，你们上过大学，现在能享用自己的起居室或卧室兼起居室，因此你们完全有理由说，天才不该去管这类意见，天才不该去理会别人的评论。不幸的是，正是有天赋的男人或女人最在乎别人怎么评论他们。想想济慈，想想他在自己墓碑上刻着的话。想想丁尼生，想想——但是我不需要再增加例子来证明那不可否认的事实了（如果可以说这个事实会带来好运的话），那就是，过分在乎别人对自己的看法是艺术家的天性。文学作品里到处都是那些不理智、过分在意别人意见的不幸的人。","But what is amusing now, I recollected, shutting Lady Bessborough, had to be taken in desperate earnest once.Opinions that one now pastes in a book labelled cock-a-doodle-dum and keeps for reading to select audiences on summer nights once drew tears, I can assure you.Among your grandmothers and great-grandmothers there were many that wept their eyes out.Florence Nightingale shrieked aloud in her agony. [7]Moreover, it is all very well for you, who have got yourselves to college and enjoy sitting-rooms—or is it only bed-sitting-rooms?—of your own to say that genius should disregard such opinions; that genius should be above caring what is said of it.Unfortunately, it is precisely the men or women of genius who mind most what is said of them.Remember Keats.Remember the words he had cut on his tombstone.Think of Tennyson; think—but I need hardly multiply instances of the undeniable, if very fortunate, fact that it is the nature of the artist to mind excessively what is said about him.Literature is strewn with the wreckage of men who have minded beyond reason the opinions of others."
"再回到我最开始的问题上，即哪种心境最宜于创作，我想，他们的敏感性使他们的不幸加倍了，因为看着《安东尼和克莱奥帕特》处翻开的那本书时，我揣度，为了将自己的作品完整无缺地表达出来，需要极大的努力，艺术家的脑子一定要如莎士比亚般极度清晰。他们的脑子里不能有一点阻碍，也不能有任何未耗尽的异物。","And this susceptibility of theirs is doubly unfortunate, I thought, returning again to my original enquiry into what state of mind is most propitious for creative work, because the mind of an artist, in order to achieve the prodigious effort of freeing whole and entire the work that is in him, must be incandescent, like Shakespeare’s mind, I conjectured, looking at the book which lay open at ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA.There must be no obstacle in it, no foreign matter unconsumed."
"虽然我们说我们毫不了解莎士比亚的心境，但我们在说这话的时候，就已经在说关于莎士比亚心境的某些东西。也许我们之所以对莎士比亚了解得很少——与多恩、本·琼森和弥尔顿相比——是因为他的嫌恶、怨恨和反感不为世人体察。　　　　　　没有什么让我们想起作家的“启示”来阻碍我们。一切要抗议、传道、诉冤、报复、让世界来见证困难和冤情的愿望都从他的心里烧掉、耗尽了。因此他的诗才能自由畅快且不受阻碍地表达出来。如果有谁能把自己的作品完完整整地表达出来，那一定是莎士比亚。如果说谁有极度清晰、无所羁绊的头脑的话，我又看了看书架，心想，那就是莎士比亚的头脑了。","For though we say that we know nothing about Shakespeare’s state of mind, even as we say that, we are saying something about Shakespeare’s state of mind.The reason perhaps why we know so little of Shakespeare—compared with Donne or Ben Jonson or Milton—is that his grudges and spites and antipathies are hidden from us.We are not held up by some ‘revelation’ which reminds us of the writer.All desire to protest, to preach, to proclaim an injury, to pay off a score, to make the world the witness of some hardship or grievance was fired out of him and consumed.Therefore his poetry flows from him free and unimpeded.If ever a human being got his work expressed completely, it was Shakespeare.If ever a mind was incandescent, unimpeded, I thought, turning again to the bookcase, it was Shakespeare’s mind."
"第四章","CHAPTER FOUR"
"人们会发现，在十六世纪一个女人能有那样的心境显然是不可能的。人们只要想想伊丽莎白时代的墓碑，上面那些小孩子紧握着双手跪着，想想他们的夭折，再看看他们的房子里那些黑暗、窄狭的房间，就意识到那时候没有女人能写诗。人们期望发现的是，或许后来某个贵妇利用她相对的自由和安逸，用自己的名字出版一些东西，并冒着被认为是怪物的危险。男人当然不是势利的人，我继续想，小心地避开丽贝卡·韦斯特小姐的“声名狼藉的女权主义”，不过他们大部分都带着同情对一位伯爵夫人写诗的努力表示赞赏。人们会发现，在那时，一位有爵位的贵妇得到的鼓励要比一位不知名的奥斯汀小姐或是勃朗特小姐多得多。","That one would find any woman in that state of mind in the sixteenth century was obviously impossible.One has only to think of the Elizabethan tombstones with all those children kneeling with clasped hands; and their early deaths; and to see their houses with their dark, cramped rooms, to realize that no woman could have written poetry then.What one would expect to find would be that rather later perhaps some great lady would take advantage of her comparative freedom and comfort to publish something with her name to it and risk being thought a monster.Men, of course, are not snobs, I continued, carefully eschewing ‘the arrant feminism’ of Miss Rebecca West; but they appreciate with sympathy for the most part the efforts of a countess to write verse.One would expect to find a lady of title meeting with far greater encouragement than an unknown Miss Austen or a Miss Bronte at that time would have met with."
"不过人们也会发现，她的心被畏惧、仇恨等与诗不相干的情感所扰乱，而且她的诗中显示出了这种搅扰的痕迹。例如温奇尔西夫人，我这样想道，并且把她的诗集取了下来。她生在一六六一年；她是贵族出身，又嫁给贵族；她没有孩子；她写诗，人们只要打开她的诗集就会发现她对女人的地位爆发出的愤慨：","But one would also expect to find that her mind was disturbed by alien emotions like fear and hatred and that her poems showed traces of that disturbance.Here is Lady Winchilsea, for example, I thought, taking down her poems.She was born in the year 1661; she was noble both by birth and by marriage; she was childless; she wrote poetry, and one has only to open her poetry to find her bursting out in indignation against the position of women:"
"我们是多么地堕落！因错误的规则而堕落；","How we are fallen! fallen by mistaken rules,"
"更多是受到教育的愚弄而非天生愚顽；","And Education’s more than Nature’s fools;"
"不让我们的头脑得到改善，","Debarred from all improvements of the mind,"
"人们期望并设计我们变得无趣；","And to be dull, expected and designed;"
"若是有某人能胜人一筹，","And if someone would soar above the rest,"
"有较热切的幻想，并为雄心壮志所驱使，","With warmer fancy, and ambition pressed,"
"反对派仍强大无比，","So strong the opposing faction still appears,"
"前进的希望永远不能战胜畏惧。","The hopes to thrive can ne’er outweigh the fears."
"她的头脑很显然并没有“消除一切障碍而变得极度清晰”。相反，她的头脑被仇恨和怨愤打扰，注意力被分散。人类在她看来分裂成两派。男人是“反对派”；男人是可恨、可怕的，因为他们有权力阻止她做想做的事——那就是写作。","Clearly her mind has by no means ‘consumed all impediments and become incandescent’.On the contrary, it is harassed and distracted with hates and grievances.The human race is split up for her into two parties.Men are the ‘opposing faction’; men are hated and feared, because they have the power to bar her way to what she wants to do—which is to write."
"唉！一个尝试写作的女人，","Alas! a woman that attempts the pen,"
"被视为狂妄放肆之徒，","Such a presumptuous creature is esteemed,"
"以至再没有美德能弥补这个过错。","The fault can by no virtue be redeemed."
"他们说我们弄错了我们的性别和行为方式；","They tell us we mistake our sex and way;"
"良好的教养、时尚、舞蹈、穿戴、游戏，","Good breeding, fashion, dancing, dressing, play,"
"才是我们应当学的才艺；","Are the accomplishments we should desire;"
"写作、读书、思考，或者探究，","To write, or read, or think, or to enquire,"
"会玷污我们的美丽，耗尽我们的时间，","Would cloud our beauty, and exhaust our time,"
"使我们青春的俘虏望而却步。","And interrupt the conquests of our prime."
"而乏味地管理着满室奴仆，","Whilst the dull manage of a servile house"
"被有些人认为是我们最高的技能和用途。","Is held by some our utmost art and use."
"确实，她不得不先假定她所写的东西永远不会被发表，然后再鼓励自己去写作；她须用这种忧郁的歌唱来安慰自己：","Indeed she has to encourage herself to write by supposing that what she writes will never be published; to soothe herself with the sad chant:"
"对很少的几个朋友、对你自己的悲伤歌唱吧，","To some few friends, and to thy sorrows sing,"
"因为月桂树林从不是为你而生；","For groves of laurel thou wert never meant;"
"树阴下确实很暗，你还是安心地呆在那里吧。","Be dark enough thy shades, and be thou there content."
"然而很显然，只要她能把心里的仇恨和畏惧除去，并且没有满怀悲苦和怨恨，那她心里的诗火就是炽热的。偶尔有带着纯粹诗意的词句流出来：","Yet it is clear that could she have freed her mind from hate and fear and not heaped it with bitterness and resentment, the fire was hot within her.Now and again words issue of pure poetry:"
"也不会用褪色的丝线编织，","Nor will in fading silks compose,"
"隐约地再现那无双的玫瑰。这些诗句被默里先生公正地称赞过，而且大家认为，蒲柏记得、甚至曾用过其他几句：","Faintly the inimitable rose.—they are rightly praised by Mr. Murry, and Pope, it is thought, remembered and appropriated those others:"
"现在长寿花战胜了衰弱的大脑；","Now the jonquille o’ercomes the feeble brain;"
"我们在芬芳的痛苦下晕倒。","We faint beneath the aromatic pain."
"一个能写出这样的诗句的女人，一个在精神上热爱自然、乐于沉思的女人，被逼得抒发愤怒和悲苦，这真是太可惜了。但是她又怎能不这样呢？想象着那些冷嘲热讽、谄媚者的奉承，以及职业诗人的怀疑，我这样问道。她肯定是把自己关在乡下的一个房间里写作；虽然她的丈夫无比宽容，他们的婚姻生活完美无瑕，但是她或许还是会因悲苦和顾虑而心神分裂。我说“肯定”，是因为当人们在查找温奇尔西夫人的生平时，通常会发现，人们对她一无所知。她饱受忧郁之苦。她告诉我们，在忧郁时她会想象下面的诗句，我们发现这一点，就至少能在某种程度上对她的忧郁作出解释：","It was a thousand pities that the woman who could write like that, whose mind was tuned to nature and reflection, should have been forced to anger and bitterness.But how could she have helped herself?I asked, imagining the sneers and the laughter, the adulation of the toadies, the scepticism of the professional poet.She must have shut herself up in a room in the country to write, and been torn asunder by bitterness and scruples perhaps, though her husband was of the kindest, and their married life perfection.She ‘must have’, I say, because when one comes to seek out the facts about Lady Winchilsea, one finds, as usual, that almost nothing is known about her.She suffered terribly from melancholy, which we can explain at least to some extent when we find her telling us how in the grip of it she would imagine:"
"我的诗行受人谴责，我的工作被人认为是","My lines decried, and my employment thought"
"一种无用的愚行或是狂妄的过错。","An useless folly or presumptuous fault:"
"在人们看来，这个被如此责难的工作是一种在田野里漫步、幻想的无害工作：","The employment, which was thus censured, was, as far as one can see, the harmless one of rambling about the fields and dreaming:"
"我的手欣喜地探求不寻常的事物，","My hand delights to trace unusual things,"
"偏离那熟稔、普通的方式。","And deviates from the known and common way,"
"也不会用褪色的丝线编织，","Nor will in fading silks compose,"
"隐约地再现那无双的玫瑰。","Faintly the inimitable rose."
"自然，如果那是她的习惯，并且是她喜欢的，她就只有等着被人取笑，而且，据说蒲柏或是盖伊也曾因此讽刺她“是一个渴望乱写的女学者”。也有人认为，她因为取笑盖伊而得罪了他。她说，他的《琐事》表明“比起坐轿子来，他更适合抬轿子”。但是默里先生说，这些都是“可疑的闲话”，而且“令人厌烦”。但是在这点上我不赞同他的看法，因为即使是可疑的闲话，我也很愿意能多有一点，那样的话，我就可以找出或是拼出这位忧郁夫人的形象。她爱在田野里漫步，想一些不寻常的事情，并且如此轻率、不明智地蔑视了“对满室奴仆的乏味管理”。但是默里先生说她变得很散乱。她的天赋上长满了杂草，并且被欧石南缠绕。这优秀卓越的天赋没有机会把自己显露出来。所以，我把她的书放回书架，转向另一位贵妇——拉姆爱的那位公爵夫人，那位轻率的、富于幻想的玛格丽特·纽卡斯尔。她比温奇尔西夫人年纪大，但她们同时代。她们非常不同，但是在这几方面却是相同的：她们都是贵族，都没有孩子，都嫁了最好的丈夫。对诗都抱有同样的热情，而且都因同样的原因而毁了容。打开公爵夫人的书，人们发现书中同样爆发出了愤怒：“女人像蝙蝠或是猫头鹰一样活着，像牲畜一样劳动，像虫子一样死去……”玛格丽特本来也可能变成一位诗人；在我们这时代，所有那些活力最终会转动某种轮子。事实上，什么东西能约束、驯服，或是教化那种充满野性、十分丰富、未受教育的智慧来为人类做点事呢？那智慧杂乱无章地涌出来，体现在韵文、散文、诗和哲学的急流中，它们凝结在四开本和对开本的书中，这些书从未有人读过。应该有人拿一个显微镜放在她手里。应该有人教她观察星象并按科学的方法推理。她的智慧靠独处和自由来驱动。没有人阻止她。没有人教她。教授们奉承她。在宫廷里他们嘲笑她。埃杰顿·布里奇斯爵士抱怨她的粗野——“在宫廷里长大的上等女人的”粗野。她把自己独自关在韦尔贝克。","Naturally, if that was her habit and that was her delight, she could only expect to be laughed at; and, accordingly, Pope or Gay is said to have satirized her ‘as a blue-stocking with an itch for scribbling’.Also it is thought that she offended Gay by laughing at him.She said that his TRIVIA showed that ‘he was more proper to walk before a chair than to ride in one’.But this is all ‘dubious gossip’ and, says Mr Murry, ‘uninteresting’.But there I do not agree with him, for I should have liked to have had more even of dubious gossip so that I might have found out or made up some image of this melancholy lady, who loved wandering in the fields and thinking about unusual things and scorned, so rashly, so unwisely, ‘the dull manage of a servile house’.　But she became diffuse, Mr Murry says.Her gift is all grown about with weeds and bound with briars.It had no chance of showing itself for the fine distinguished gift it was.And so, putting her back on the shelf, I turned to the other great lady, the Duchess whom Lamb loved, harebrained, fantastical Margaret of Newcastle, her elder, but her contemporary.They were very different, but alike in this that both were noble and both childless, and both were married to the best of husbands.In both burnt the same passion for poetry and both are disfigured and deformed by the same causes.Open the Duchess and one finds the same outburst of rage.‘Women live like Bats or Owls, labour like Beasts, and die like Worms....’Margaret too might have been a poet; in our day all that activity would have turned a wheel of some sort.As it was, what could bind, tame or civilize for human use that wild, generous, untutored intelligence?It poured itself out, higgledy-piggledy, in torrents of rhyme and prose, poetry and philosophy which stand congealed in quartos and folios that nobody ever reads.She should have had a microscope put in her hand.She should have been taught to look at the stars and reason scientifically.Her wits were turned with solitude and freedom.No one checked her.No one taught her.The professors fawned on her.At Court they jeered at her.Sir Egerton Brydges complained of her coarseness—‘as flowing from a female of high rank brought up in the Courts’.She shut herself up at Welbeck alone."
"玛格丽特·卡文迪什使人想起多么孤独、纷乱的景象啊！好像一棵巨大的黄瓜将枝叶伸展到了花园里所有的玫瑰和康乃馨上，使它们窒息而死。那是多么浪费啊，一个女人能写出“最有教养的女人是那些头脑最开明的女人”这样的话，却把她的时间浪费在了乱写些废话上面，而且越来越深陷于阴暗和愚蠢之中，直到她一出门就会有很多人围住她的马车。很显然，这个疯狂的公爵夫人变成了用来恐吓聪明女孩的妖怪。我把公爵夫人的书放在一边，打开多萝西·奥斯本的信。我记得这是她写给坦普尔的信，关于公爵夫人的新书。“这可怜的女人真有点心烦意乱了，否则，她不会这样荒谬，来冒险写书，而且还是写诗。就是两个星期不睡觉，我也不会那么做。”","What a vision of loneliness and riot the thought of Margaret Cavendish brings to mind! as if some giant cucumber had spread itself over all the roses and carnations in the garden and choked them to death.What a waste that the woman who wrote ‘the best bred women are those whose minds are civilest’ should have frittered her time away scribbling nonsense and plunging ever deeper into obscurity and folly till the people crowded round her coach when she issued out. Evidently the crazy Duchess became a bogey to frighten clever girls with.Here, I remembered, putting away the Duchess and opening Dorothy Osborne’s letters, is Dorothy writing to Temple about the Duchess’s new book.‘Sure the poor woman is a little distracted, she could never be so ridiculous else as to venture at writing books, and in verse too, if I should not sleep this fortnight I should not come to that.’"
"因此，既然没有哪个理性、谦虚的女人会去写书，那么敏感又忧郁、在性格上和这位公爵夫人正相反的多萝西就什么都没有写过。信不计算在内。一个女人坐在父亲的病床边时可能会写信。她可以在男人谈话的同时坐在炉火旁写信，不会打扰他们。翻着多萝西的信，我就想，奇怪的是，这个没有人教过、孤独的女孩在句子构造和场景设计上会有如此的天赋。听她说下去：","And so, since no woman of sense and modesty could write books, Dorothy, who was sensitive and melancholy, the very opposite of the Duchess in temper, wrote nothing.Letters did not count.A woman might write letters while she was sitting by her father’s sick-bed.She could write them by the fire whilst the men talked without disturbing them.The strange thing is, I thought, turning over the pages of Dorothy’s letters, what a gift that untaught and solitary girl had for the framing of a sentence, for the fashioning of a scene.Listen to her running on:"
"吃过饭我们坐下谈天，谈到B先生时我就走了。白天的炎热在看书和工作中度过了，大约六七点的时候，我走出去，来到房子附近的一片公共草地上，那里有很多乡村姑娘在放羊放牛，坐在树阴里唱民谣。我走向她们，并且把她们的声音、美貌和我在书里读到的古代牧羊女作比较，发现其中的差别很大。不过相信我，她们和古代牧羊女一样天真。我和她们交谈，发现她们是世界上最快乐的人，唯一欠缺的是她们并不知道这一点。在我们谈话的时候，常有一个姑娘环顾四周，她发现她的那些牛正向谷地里走，于是她们全都跑了起来，好像脚上长了翅膀一样。我没有那么敏捷，就呆在后面；当我看见她们赶着牛回家时，我想我也该回去了。我吃过晚饭，就走进花园，走到它旁边的一条小河边上，坐在那里，希望你和我在一起……”","‘After dinner we sit and talk till Mr B. comes in question, and then I am gone.  The heat of the day is spent in reading or working, and about six or seven o’clock, I walked out into a common that lies hard by the house, where a great many young wenches keep sheep and cows, and sit in the shade singing of ballads. I go to them and compare their voices and beauties to some ancient shepherdesses that I have read of, and find a vast difference there; but, trust me, I think these are as innocent as those could be.I talk to them, and find they want nothing to make them the happiest people in the world but the knowledge that they are so.Most commonly when we are in the midst of our discourse, one looks about her and spies her cows going into the corn and then they all run as if they had wings at their heels.I, that am not so nimble, stay behind; and when I see them driving home their cattle, I think ‘tis time for me to retire too. When I have supped, I go into the garden, and so to the side of a small river that runs by it where I sit down and wish you were with me....’ "
"人们可以确信她有作家的天赋。但是“就是两个星期不睡觉，我也不会那么做”——当人们发现，即使一个很有写作禀赋的女人都使自己相信写书是荒谬的，甚至使自己显得心烦意乱，那他们就可以估量出流传开来的反对女人写作的情绪有多强了。把薄薄一卷多萝西·奥斯本的书信放回书架，接下来，我们来看看贝英太太。","One could have sworn that she had the makings of a writer in her. But ‘if I should not sleep this fortnight I should not come to that’—one can measure the opposition that was in the air to a woman writing when one finds that even a woman with a great turn for writing has brought herself to believe that to write a book was to be ridiculous, even to show oneself distracted.And so we come, I continued, replacing the single short volume of Dorothy Osborne’s letters upon the shelf, to Mrs Behn."
"跟着贝英太太，我们经历了一个非常重要的转折。我们把那些孤独的贵妇人留在身后，把她们和她们的对开本一起关在她们的庭院里。她们写作只为自己高兴，没有读者，也没有人批评。我们到城里和街上的普通人接触。贝英太太是一个中产阶级妇女，具有平民的所有美德——幽默、活力和勇气。她因为丈夫去世，再加上自己的几次不幸的冒险，被迫靠智慧谋生。她不得不和男人们在同等条件下工作。因为工作很努力，她赚的钱足够生存。这个事实比她实际上所写的任何东西都重要，甚至比她的杰出作品《我折磨了一千个人》或是《爱情坐在奇异的胜利里》都重要，因为在这儿思想开始获得自由，或是更确切地说，思想开始有可能会随着时间的推移，获得想写什么就写什么的自由。因为既然阿芙拉·贝英已经这样做了，女孩们可以去对她们的父母说：你们不用给我零花钱了，我能用我的钢笔赚钱。当然，多年来答案一直都是：是的，过阿芙拉·贝英那样的日子。死了也比那样强！门被砰地关上，而且关得比以往更快了。那个非常有趣的话题在这儿很值得讨论，那就是男人对女人的贞洁的重视，以及这种重视对她们所受教育的影响，而且如果戈廷或是纽纳姆的哪个学生愿意去研究的话，就可能写出一本有趣的书。戴着钻石、坐在蚊虫乱飞的苏格兰荒野中的达德利夫人，或许可以用作卷首插图。前几天，达德利夫人死后，《泰晤士报》说：“达德利勋爵，是一个有教养、有品位，并且多才多艺的人，仁慈慷慨，但却古怪专制。他坚持让他的太太穿礼服，即使是在高地最遥远的狩猎小屋里也是如此；他把华丽的珠宝加到她的身上，”以及诸如此类的话，“他给她所有的东西——但从不包括任何责任”。后来达德利勋爵中风了，从此以后她照顾他，并用卓越的能力管理他的财产。那种古怪的专制在十九世纪也存在。","And with Mrs Behn we turn a very important corner on the road.We leave behind, shut up in their parks among their folios, those solitary great ladies who wrote without audience or criticism, for their own delight alone.We come to town and rub shoulders with ordinary people in the streets.Mrs Behn was a middle-class woman with all the plebeian virtues of humour, vitality and courage; a woman forced by the death of her husband and some unfortunate adventures of her own to make her living by her wits.She had to work on equal terms with men.She made, by working very hard, enough to live on.The importance of that fact outweighs anything that she actually wrote, even the splendid ‘A Thousand Martyrs I have made’, or ‘Love in Fantastic Triumph sat’, for here begins the freedom of the mind, or rather the possibility that in the course of time the mind will be free to write what it likes.For now that Aphra Behn had done it, girls could go to their parents and say, You need not give me an allowance; I can make money by my pen. Of course the answer for many years to come was, Yes, by living the life of Aphra Behn!Death would be better! and the door was slammed faster than ever.That profoundly interesting subject, the value that men set upon women’s chastity and its effect upon their education, here suggests itself for discussion, and might provide an interesting book if any student at Girton or Newnham cared to go into the matter.Lady Dudley, sitting in diamonds among the midges of a Scottish moor, might serve for frontispiece.Lord Dudley, THE TIMES said when Lady Dudley died the other day, ‘a man of cultivated taste and many accomplishments, was benevolent and bountiful, but whimsically despotic.He insisted upon his wife’s wearing full dress, even at the remotest shooting-lodge in the Highlands; he loaded her with gorgeous jewels’, and so on, ‘he gave her everything—always excepting any measure of responsibility’.Then Lord Dudley had a stroke and she nursed him and ruled his estates with supreme competence for ever after.That whimsical despotism was in the nineteenth century too."
"但是话说回来。阿芙拉·贝英证明，或许以牺牲某些令人愉悦的品质为代价，写作可以赚钱，因此，渐渐地，写作变得不只是愚蠢和心烦意乱的标志，而且也具有实际的重要性。丈夫可能会去世，或者某种灾难会突然降临在家中。随着十八世纪的到来，成百上千名妇女开始通过做翻译或是写大量的蹩脚小说来多赚些私房钱，或是去拯救家庭。甚至在教科书里都不再提那些小说了，但是偶然还能在查灵十字街的廉价书摊上发现它们。在十八世纪后半叶，思想的极端活跃在女性中显现出来——她们讨论、聚会、写关于莎士比亚的散文、翻译经典作品，这种活跃是建立在妇女能通过写作来赚钱这一可靠的事实上的。对于那些没有报酬就显得没有意义的事，钱给了它们尊严。可能仍然有理由嘲笑她们是“渴望乱写的女学者”，但不可否认，她们能把钱装进自己的钱包里。因此，十八世纪末发生了一个变化。如果我能重写历史，我会更充分地描述它，并且认为它比十字军、玫瑰战争更重要。","But to return.Aphra Behn proved that money could be made by writing at the sacrifice, perhaps, of certain agreeable qualities; and so by degrees writing became not merely a sign of folly and a distracted mind, but was of practical importance.A husband might die, or some disaster overtake the family.Hundreds of women began as the eighteenth century drew on to add to their pin money, or to come to the rescue of their families by making translations or writing the innumerable bad novels which have ceased to be recorded even in text-books, but are to be picked up in the fourpenny boxes in the Charing Cross Road.The extreme activity of mind which showed itself in the later eighteenth century among women—the talking, and the meeting, the writing of essays on Shakespeare, the translating of the classics—was founded on the solid fact that women could make money by writing.Money dignifies what is frivolous if unpaid for.It might still be well to sneer at ‘blue stockings with an itch for scribbling’, but it could not be denied that they could put money in their purses.Thus, towards the end of the eighteenth century a change came about which, if I were rewriting history, I should describe more fully and think of greater importance than the Crusades or the Wars of the Roses."
"中产阶级女性开始写作了。因为如果《傲慢与偏见》重要，如果《米德尔马契》、《维莱特》和《呼啸山庄》重要，那么一般女性——不仅仅是把自己关在乡下的房子里、被对开本和奉承者包围的那些孤独的贵妇——开始写作的重要性，要比我在一个小时的论述中所能证明的大得多。没有那些先驱者，简·奥斯汀、勃朗特姐妹以及乔治·艾略特就不会写作，就像没有马洛，莎士比亚就不会写作一样，或者说马洛没有乔叟就不会写作，而没有那些已被遗忘的诗人，乔叟也不会写作，这些诗人铺好了道路、驯服了语言天生的野性。因为杰作的诞生并不是单一而独立的，杰作是许多年共同思考的结果，是主要人群思考的产物，因此，单一声音的后面是群体的经验。简·奥斯汀应该在范尼·伯尼的墓上放一个花圈，乔治·艾略特应该向伊莱扎·卡特强壮的灵魂致敬——那个勇敢的老太太为了早起学希腊语，在她的床架上系了一个铃铛。所有的女人应该一起把花撒落在阿芙拉·贝英的坟墓上，因为是她为她们争得了说出思想的权利。阿弗拉·贝恩的坟墓极其叫人反感而又相当合适地被安置在威斯敏斯特教堂。就是她——尽管她可疑而多情——使我觉得今晚向你们说“用你的智慧一年挣五百英镑”并不太荒诞。","The middle-class woman began to write.For if PRIDE AND PREJUDICE matters, and MIDDLEMARCH and VILLETTE and WUTHERING HEIGHTS matter, then it matters far more than I can prove in an hour’s discourse that women generally, and not merely the lonely aristocrat shut up in her country house among her folios and her flatterers, took to writing.Without those forerunners, Jane Austen and the Brontes and George Eliot could no more have written than Shakespeare could have written without Marlowe, or Marlowe without Chaucer, or Chaucer without those forgotten poets who paved the ways and tamed the natural savagery of the tongue.For masterpieces are not single and solitary births; they are the outcome of many years of thinking in common, of thinking by the body of the people, so that the experience of the mass is behind the single voice.Jane Austen should have laid a wreath upon the grave of Fanny Burney, and George Eliot done homage to the robust shade of Eliza Carter—the valiant old woman who tied a bell to her bedstead in order that she might wake early and learn Greek.All women together ought to let flowers fall upon the tomb of Aphra Behn, which is, most scandalously but rather appropriately, in Westminster Abbey, for it was she who earned them the right to speak their minds.It is she—shady and amorous as she was—who makes it not quite fantastic for me to say to you tonight: Earn five hundred a year by your wits."
"现在，人们到了十九世纪初期。在这里，我第一次发现好几个书架上放的全是女性的作品。但是一眼看去，我禁不住要问，为什么除了极个别的例外，这些作品都是小说？原始的冲动是写诗的冲动。“歌曲的最高领袖”是一位女诗人。在法国和英国，女诗人都先于女小说家出现。而且，看看那四个著名的名字，我想，乔治·艾略特和埃米莉·勃朗特有什么共同点呢？难道夏洛特·勃朗特不是完全不能了解简·奥斯汀吗？除了她们都没有小孩这一可能相关的事实之外，没有四个聚在一间屋子里的人能比她们四个更不相同的了，以至于创造她们之间的一次聚会和对话都颇为诱人。然而，在她们写作时，某种奇怪的力量迫使她们去写了小说。这是否与出生在中产阶级家庭有关，我问道，是否与稍晚一些埃米莉·戴维斯小姐十分引人注目地指出的事实——十九世纪初中产阶级家庭只有一间起居室——有关呢。如果一个女人要写作，她就不得不在公共起居室里写。并且，正如南丁格尔小姐所强烈抱怨的那样，“女人从来没有半个小时……能称作是她们自己的”，她总是被打扰。尽管如此，写散文和小说还是要比写诗歌或是戏剧容易一些。需要的注意力更少一些。简·奥斯汀就是那样写的，直至她生命的终结。她的外甥在他的《回忆录》里写道：“她能做到所有这一切是很惊人的，因为她没有单独的书房可去，大部分工作必须在公共起居室里完成，很容易受到各种各样偶然的打扰。她小心翼翼，不让佣人、客人或是家庭以外的任何人怀疑她的职业。”[8]简·奥斯汀把她的手稿藏起来，或是用一张吸墨纸把它们盖住。再者，在十九世纪初期，一个女人所受的全部文学训练就是在性格观察、情感分析方面的训练。几个世纪以来，公共起居室的各种影响一直训练着她敏锐的感觉。人们的情感给她留了深刻的印象，人际关系总是在她的眼前呈现。因此，当中产阶级的女性开始写作时，她自然就写小说，即使这里提起的四个著名女性中有两个都似乎很明显不是天生的小说家。埃米莉·勃朗特本来应该写诗剧。当创作冲动被用在历史或是传记上时，乔治·艾略特头脑中横溢的才思就会展现出来。然而，她们写了小说。从书架上拿下《傲慢与偏见》，我说，人们也许可以更进一步，说她们写了好小说。不是自夸，也不是让男性痛苦，人们可以说《傲慢与偏见》是一本好书。无论如何，被人抓到在写《傲慢与偏见》应该不会感到羞耻。然而令简·奥斯汀高兴的是，门的铰链会吱吱作响，那样她就可以在有人进来之前把她的手稿藏起来。对简·奥斯汀来说，写《傲慢与偏见》是有些丢脸的。我想知道，如果简·奥斯汀认为没有必要把手稿藏起来不让客人看见，那《傲慢与偏见》会不会是一本更好的小说呢？","Here, then, one had reached the early nineteenth century.And here, for the first time, I found several shelves given up entirely to the works of women.But why, I could not help asking, as I ran my eyes over them, were they, with very few exceptions, all novels?The original impulse was to poetry.The ‘supreme head of song’ was a poetess.Both in France and in England the women poets precede the women novelists.Moreover, I thought, looking at the four famous names, what had George Eliot in common with Emily Bronte?Did not Charlotte Bronte fail entirely to understand Jane Austen?Save for the possibly relevant fact that not one of them had a child, four more incongruous characters could not have met together in a room—so much so that it is tempting to invent a meeting and a dialogue between them.Yet by some strange force they were all compelled when they wrote, to write novels.Had it something to do with being born of the middle class, I asked; and with the fact, which Miss Emily Davies a little later was so strikingly to demonstrate, that the middle-class family in the early nineteenth century was possessed only of a single sitting-room between them.If a woman wrote, she would have to write in the common sitting-room.And, as Miss Nightingale was so vehemently to complain,—“women never have an half hour... that they can call their own”—she was always interrupted.Still it would be easier to write prose and fiction there than to write poetry or a play.Less concentration is required.Jane Austen wrote like that to the end of her days.‘How she was able to effect all this’, her nephew writes in his Memoir, ‘is surprising, for she had no separate study to repair to, and most of the work must have been done in the general sitting-room, subject to all kinds of casual interruptions.She was careful that her occupation should not be suspected by servants or visitors or any persons beyond her own family party.’[8]Jane Austen hid her manuscripts or covered them with a piece of blotting-paper.Then, again, all the literary training that a woman had in the early nineteenth century was training in the observation of character, in the analysis of emotion.Her sensibility had been educated for centuries by the influences of the common sitting-room.People’s feelings were impressed on her; personal relations were always before her eyes.Therefore, when the middle-class Woman took to writing, she naturally wrote novels, even though, as seems evident enough, two of the four famous women here named were not by nature novelists.Emily Bronte should have written poetic plays; the overflow of George Eliot’s capacious mind should have spread itself when the creative impulse was spent upon history or biography.They wrote novels, however; one may even go further, I said, taking PRIDE AND PREJUDICE from the shelf, and say that they wrote good novels.Without boasting or giving pain to the opposite sex, one may say that PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is a good book.At any rate, one would not have been ashamed to have been caught in the act of writing PRIDE AND PREJUDICE.Yet Jane Austen was glad that a hinge creaked, so that she might hide her manuscript before anyone came in.To Jane Austen there was something discreditable in writing PRIDE AND PREJUDICE.And, I wondered, would PRIDE AND PREJUDICE have been a better novel if Jane Austen had not thought it necessary to hide her manuscript from visitors?"
"我读了一两页，看了一下，但是我完全看不出有任何迹象表明她的环境对她的写作造成了影响。这也许就是它主要的令人惊叹之处。这就是一个一八〇〇年前后写作的女人，没有仇恨，没有怨愤，没有畏惧，没有抗议，没有说教。我看着《安东尼与克莱奥帕特》，心想，那就是莎士比亚的写法。当人们把莎士比亚和简·奥斯汀进行比较时，他们可能是想说，他们两个人的思想消耗了所有的障碍。因为这个原因，我们不了解简·奥斯汀，我们不了解莎士比亚，也因为这个原因，简·奥斯汀渗透在她所写的每一个字中，莎士比亚也是这样。如果说简·奥斯汀因她所处的环境而遭受过什么痛苦的话，那就是强加在她身上的狭窄的生活。一个女人单独出门是不可能的。她从来没旅行过，从来没有坐着公共马车穿过伦敦，或是独自一人在饭店里吃午餐。然而，或许简·奥斯汀的天性就是不想要她所没有的东西。她的天赋和她的环境完全匹配。但是我怀疑夏洛特·勃朗特是否也是这样，我如此说道，同时打开《简·爱》，把它放在《傲慢与偏见》的旁边。","I read a page or two to see; but I could not find any signs that her circumstances had harmed her work in the slightest.That, perhaps, was the chief miracle about it.Here was a woman about the year 1800 writing without hate, without bitterness, without fear, without protest, without preaching.That was how Shakespeare wrote, I thought, looking at ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA; and when people compare Shakespeare and Jane Austen, they may mean that the minds of both had consumed all impediments; and for that reason we do not know Jane Austen and we do not know Shakespeare, and for that reason Jane Austen pervades every word she wrote, and so does Shakespeare.If Jane Austen suffered in any way from her circumstances it was in the narrowness of life that was imposed upon her.It was impossible for a woman to go about alone.She never travelled; she never drove through London in an omnibus or had luncheon in a shop by herself.But perhaps it was the nature of Jane Austen not to want what she had not.Her gift and her circumstances matched each other completely.But I doubt whether that was true of Charlotte Bronte, I said, opening JANE EYRE and laying it beside PRIDE AND PREJUDICE."
"我把它翻到第十二章，目光被一个短语吸引了：“任何人只要他想责备我，就都可以责备我。”我很想知道，他们责备夏洛特·勃朗特什么呢？我读到，当费尔法克斯太太做果冻时，简·爱常常爬上屋顶，瞭望远处的田野。然后她就有一种渴望——就因为这个他们责备她——“我渴望有一种眼力，这种眼力可以超过那个限制，让我看到繁华的世界，那些我听说过但从未见过的城镇和充满活力的地方；然后，我渴望拥有比现在更多的实际经验，更多地与我的同类交往，并且除了我周围的人之外，认识更多各种各样性格的人。我很尊重费尔法克斯太太和阿黛尔的优点，但是我相信还有其他一些更有生气的美德，我希望亲眼看看我所相信的东西。","I opened it at chapter twelve and my eye was caught by the phrase ‘Anybody may blame me who likes’.What were they blaming Charlotte Bronte for? I wondered.And I read how Jane Eyre used to go up on to the roof when Mrs Fairfax was making jellies and looked over the fields at the distant view.And then she longed—and it was for this that they blamed her—that ‘then I longed for a power of vision which might overpass that limit; which might reach the busy world, towns, regions full of life I had heard of but never seen: that then I desired more of practical experience than I possessed; more of intercourse with my kind, of acquaintance with variety of character than was here within my reach.I valued what was good in Mrs Fairfax, and what was good in Adele; but I believed in the existence of other and more vivid kinds of goodness, and what I believed in I wished to behold."
"“谁责备我？无疑，有很多，大家会说我不知足。我没办法——我本性就好动求变，有时它让我很苦恼……","‘Who blames me?Many, no doubt, and I shall he called discontented.I could not help it: the restlessness was in my nature; it agitated me to pain sometimes...."
"“说人类应该对平静感到满足，这是徒劳的——人必须要活动，如果找不到可做之事，他们就会创造。千百万人注定活得比我还平静，千百万人在无声地反抗自己的命运。没有人知道在被埋葬的芸芸众生中激荡着多少反叛。人们认为女人一般是非常平静的，但是女人的感觉和男人的感觉一样。她们和她们的兄弟一样需要运用她们的才能，需要一个施展的空间；太严格的限制、太绝对的停滞让她们感到痛苦，正如男人会为此感到痛苦一样。她们那些享受较多特权的同伴说她们应该只是做做布丁、织织袜子、弹弹钢琴、绣绣口袋而已，这未免太小心眼了。如果她们超出习俗对女性的要求，去做更多，学更多，而遭到谴责或嘲笑，那嘲笑、谴责她们的人就太欠考虑了。","‘It is vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied with tranquillity: they must have action; and they will make it if they cannot find it.Millions are condemned to a stiller doom than mine, and millions are in silent revolt against their lot. Nobody knows how many rebellions ferment in the masses of life which people earth.Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties and a field for their efforts as much as their brothers do; they suffer from too rigid a restraint, too absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags.It is thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex."
"“当我独自一人时，我时常听到格雷斯·普尔的笑声。”","‘When thus alone I not unfrequently heard Grace Poole’s laugh....’"
"这是一个不合时宜的停顿，我想。突然说到格雷斯·普尔令人心烦意乱。连续性被打断了。把书放在《傲慢与偏见》旁边，我接着想，人们可能会说，写出这些书的女人比简·奥斯汀有更大的天赋。但是如果通读这些书，并注意到里面的激烈，注意到那种愤慨，人们就可以看出来她永远不能把她的天赋全部完整地表现出来。她的书将会是扭曲变形的。在应该平静地去写的地方，她却带着愤怒去写。在应该明智地去写的地方，她却写得很愚笨。在应该写作品中的人物的时候，她却写她自己。她和她的命运处于交战状态。她受到限制、遭受挫败，除了年纪轻轻地死去，还能怎样呢？","That is an awkward break, I thought.It is upsetting to come upon Grace Poole all of a sudden.The continuity is disturbed.One might say, I continued, laying the book down beside PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, that the woman who wrote those pages had more genius in her than Jane Austen; but if one reads them over and marks that jerk in them, that indignation, one sees that she will never get her genius expressed whole and entire.Her books will be deformed and twisted.She will write in a rage where she should write calmly.She will write foolishly where she should write wisely.She will write of herself where she should write of her characters.She is at war with her lot. How could she help but die young, cramped and thwarted?"
"人们忍不住玩味一下这种想法，如果夏洛特·勃朗特一年拥有比如说三百英镑的话，那可能会发生什么事情呢——但是这个傻女人以一千五百英镑的价格把她的小说版权全卖掉了；如果通过某种方式她对繁华世界、城镇和充满活力的地区有更多的了解，如果她有更多的实际经验，如果和她的同类人有更多交往，能和各种各样性格的人相识，那么会发生什么呢？说这些话时，她不仅确切地指出她自己作为小说家的缺点，而且还指出当时所有女性的缺点。没有人比她更清楚，如果她的天赋不用在孤独地眺望遥远的田野，如果她能够得到经验、与人交往、出去旅行的话，她的天赋会获得多么巨大的益处。可是她得不到这些，没有赋予她这些机会。我们必须接受这个事实，就是所有那些好小说——《维莱特》、《埃玛》、《呼啸山庄》、《米德尔马契》——都是女人写的，这些女人的阅历至多就是走进一位可敬的牧师家里，她们在那所值得人们尊敬的房子的公共起居室里写作，而且她们穷得一次只能买几刀纸，用来写《呼啸山庄》或是《简·爱》。的确，她们之中有一个人，乔治·艾略特，在经历诸多磨难之后逃脱了，不过也只是逃到了圣约翰森林一所隐蔽的别墅里。她在全世界都反对她的阴影下安顿了下来。她写道：“我希望大家能理解，我不会请那些不主动要求过来的人来看我”。因为她不是和一个已婚男人未婚同居吗？看一看她岂不就会玷污史密斯太太或是任何碰巧过来看她的人的贞洁吗？一个人一定要顺从社会习俗，并且要“与世隔绝”。同时，在欧洲的另一端，有一个年轻的男子，他自由地和这个吉卜赛女人或者那个贵妇人住在一起，去打仗，并且不受阻碍、不受非议地获得各种各样的人生体验。他后来写书的时候，这些体验给他提供了十分不错的素材。假使托尔斯泰与某位“与世隔绝”的已婚隐居在小隐修院里，那么我想，不管这个道德教训有多大的启迪作用，他都很难写出《战争与和平》了。","One could not but play for a moment with the thought of what might have happened if Charlotte Bronte had possessed say three hundred a year—but the foolish woman sold the copyright of her novels outright for fifteen hundred pounds; had somehow possessed more knowledge of the busy world, and towns and regions full of life; more practical experience, and intercourse with her kind and acquaintance with a variety of character.In those words she puts her finger exactly not only upon her own defects as a novelist but upon those of her sex at that time.She knew, no one better, how enormously her genius would have profited if it had not spent itself in solitary visions over distant fields; if experience and intercourse and travel had been granted her.But they were not granted; they were withheld; and we must accept the fact that all those good novels, VILLETTE, EMMA, WUTHERING HEIGHTS, MIDDLEMARCH, were written by women without more experience of life than could enter the house of a respectable clergyman; written too in the common sitting-room of that respectable house and by women so poor that they could not afford to buy more than a few quires of paper at a time upon which to write WUTHERING HEIGHTS or JANE EYRE.One of them, it is true, George Eliot, escaped after much tribulation, but only to a secluded villa in St John’s Wood.And there she settled down in the shadow of the world’s disapproval.‘I wish it to be understood’, she wrote, ‘that I should never invite anyone to come and see me who did not ask for the invitation’; for was she not living in sin with a married man and might not the sight of her damage the chastity of Mrs Smith or whoever it might be that chanced to call?One must submit to the social convention, and be ‘cut off from what is called the world’.At the same time, on the other side of Europe, there was a young man living freely with this gypsy or with that great lady; going to the wars; picking up unhindered and uncensored all that varied experience of human life which served him so splendidly later when he came to write his books.Had Tolstoi lived at the Priory in seclusion with a married lady ‘cut off from what is called the world’, however edifying the moral lesson, he could scarcely, I thought, have written WAR AND PEACE."
"但是人们或许可以更深入地探讨小说写作以及性别对小说家的影响这个问题。如果闭上眼睛把小说作为一个整体来想，小说就是和生活有某种相似的创作，就像镜子中的生活一样，尽管肯定有无数的简化和歪曲。无论如何，它是在人们脑海中留下轮廓的建筑物，有时是方形的，有时是塔形的，有时伸出侧翼和拱廊，有时又很坚固紧凑，还带着像君士坦丁堡的圣索菲亚大教堂那样的圆顶。回想几本出名的小说，我想，这个轮廓激起了人们心中与其相称的那种情感。但是这种情感又立即与其他情感掺杂在一起，因为这种“轮廓”不是由石头与石头之间的关系构成的，而是人与人之间的关系。因此，一本小说在我们心中激起各种敌对、对立的情感。生活和某种不是生活的东西相冲突。因此我们很难对小说达成一致意见，个人偏见也对我们有极大的影响。一方面，我们觉得，你——主人公约翰——一定得活着，不然我就会非常绝望。另一方面，我们又觉得，啊，约翰，你一定得死去，因为这本书的形式需要你死。生活和某种不是生活的东西相冲突。既然它在某种程度上是生活，我们就把它当作生活加以判断。有人说，詹姆斯是我最厌恶的那类人。或者，这是荒谬的大杂烩。我自己从来没有过这种感觉。回想起任何一本著名的小说，很显然，那整个结构是极其复杂的，因为它是由这么多不同的评价、这么多种不同的情感构成的。奇怪的是，这种结构的书能在一两年之后仍保持完整，或者说，它对英国读者和它对俄国读者、中国读者的意义可能是一样的。但是它们的完整性偶尔的确保存得非常好。在这些罕见的幸存的例子中（我正在想《战争与和平》），能保存它们完整性的正是人们所谓的正直，尽管这里指的并不是不欠账或是在紧急时刻表现得很可敬。对小说家来讲，所谓正直就是他会使你相信这是真实的。是的，人们会觉得，我绝不会想到会是这样的，我从来不知道有人会这么做。但是你让我相信，就是这样的，就是这样发生的。人们在阅读的时候，把每个短语、每个场景都拿到光亮下——很奇怪，因为大自然好像给了我们一种内心的光亮，通过它可以判断小说家正直与否。或者可以说，是大自然在她最不理性的时候用无形的墨水在思想的墙壁上写了一句预言，由这些大艺术家们来证实，又或是画了一幅草图，只要拿到天才之火前面就可以看得见。当人们让它这样显露出来并且看着它活起来的时候，会狂热地叫喊：这就是我一直感觉、知道而且盼望的！于是人们极度兴奋，甚至带着一种敬重把书合上——好像它是非常宝贵的东西，只要人们活着就可以向它寻求依靠——然后把它放回到书架上。我拿起《战争与和平》，并把它放回到原来的位置，这样说道。另一方面，假使这些人们抽出来并予以检查的可怜的句子，先以其明亮鲜艳的色彩、富有活力的姿态而激起一种迅速而热切的反响，但却又止步于此，仿佛有什么东西阻碍了它们的发展，或者，假使他们只是把角落里模糊潦草的字迹以及那里的污渍暴露出来，而没有完整全面的东西出现，那么，人们就会因失望而叹气说：又一次失败。这部小说在某些方面失败了。","But one could perhaps go a little deeper into the question of novel-writing and the effect of sex upon the novelist.If one shuts one’s eyes and thinks of the novel as a whole, it would seem to be a creation owning a certain looking glass likeness to life, though of course with simplifications and distortions innumerable.At any rate, it is a structure leaving a shape on the mind’s eye, built now in squares, now pagoda shaped, now throwing out wings and arcades, now solidly compact and domed like the Cathedral of Saint Sofia at Constantinople.This shape, I thought, thinking back over certain famous novels, starts in one the kind of emotion that is appropriate to it.But that emotion at once blends itself with others, for the ‘shape’ is not made by the relation of stone to stone, but by the relation of human being to human being.Thus a novel starts in us all sorts of antagonistic and opposed emotions.Life conflicts with something that is not life.Hence the difficulty of coming to any agreement about novels, and the immense sway that our private prejudices have upon us.On the one hand we feel You—John the hero—must live, or I shall be in the depths of despair.On the other, we feel, Alas, John, you must die, because the shape of the book requires it.Life conflicts with something that is not life.Then since life it is in part, we judge it as life.James is the sort of man I most detest, one says.Or, This is a farrago of absurdity.I could never feel anything of the sort myself.The whole structure, it is obvious, thinking back on any famous novel, is one of infinite complexity, because it is thus made up of so many different judgements, of so many different kinds of emotion.The wonder is that any book so composed holds together for more than a year or two, or can possibly mean to the English reader what it means for the Russian or the Chinese.But they do hold together occasionally very remarkably.And what holds them together in these rare instances of survival (I was thinking of WAR AND PEACE) is something that one calls integrity, though it has nothing to do with paying one’s bills or behaving honourably in an emergency.What one means by integrity, in the case of the novelist, is the conviction that he gives one that this is the truth.Yes, one feels, I should never have thought that this could be so; I have never known people behaving like that.But you have convinced me that so it is, so it happens.One holds every phrase, every scene to the light as one reads—for Nature seems, very oddly, to have provided us with an inner light by which to judge of the novelist’s integrity or disintegrity.Or perhaps it is rather that Nature, in her most irrational mood, has traced in invisible ink on the walls of the mind a premonition which these great artists confirm; a sketch which only needs to be held to the fire of genius to become visible.When one so exposes it and sees it come to life one exclaims in rapture, But this is what I have always felt and known and desired!And one boils over with excitement, and, shutting the book even with a kind of reverence as if it were something very precious, a stand-by to return to as long as one lives, one puts it back on the shelf, I said, taking WAR AND PEACE and putting it back in its place.If, on the other hand, these poor sentences that one takes and tests rouse first a quick and eager response with their bright colouring and their dashing gestures but there they stop: something seems to check them in their development: or if they bring to light only a faint scribble in that corner and a blot over there, and nothing appears whole and entire, then one heaves a sigh of disappointment and says.Another failure.This novel has come to grief somewhere."
"当然，总的来说，小说的确在某些方面会失败。在极度紧张的状态下，想象力就会衰退。洞察力就会混乱，再也不能分辨真伪，再也没有力量继续做大量的工作，这一工作时刻都需要使用许多不同的官能。不过，看着《简·爱》和其他的书，我就想，这一切怎么会受小说家性别的影响呢？性别会不会以什么方式影响一个女小说家的正直——那种我认为是作家的支柱的正直？现在，在我从《简·爱》里引用的段落中，可以清楚地看出，愤怒削弱了小说家夏洛特·勃朗特的正直。她离开她应该全心全意去写的故事，转而去写某些个人的委屈。她记得她一直没有得到她应得的那份经历——当她想要到世界上去自由游历时，却被迫呆在一个牧师的住所里补袜子。她的想象力因愤怒而偏离方向，我们能感觉得到。但是除了愤怒，还有其他影响在拉扯她的想象力，使想象力偏离正道。例如，无知。罗切斯特的画像是在黑暗中画的。在其中我们感觉到了恐惧的影响，正如我们经常感觉到一种由压迫带来的尖刻，一种隐埋在激情之下暗暗燃烧的痛苦，一种给那些作品带去阵阵痛苦的积怨，尽管这些作品很优秀。","And for the most part, of course, novels do come to grief somewhere.The imagination falters under the enormous strain.The insight is confused; it can no longer distinguish between the true and the false, it has no longer the strength to go on with the vast labour that calls at every moment for the use of so many different faculties.But how would all this be affected by the sex of the novelist, I wondered, looking at JANE EYRE and the others.Would the fact of her sex in any way interfere with the integrity of a woman novelist—that integrity which I take to be the backbone of the writer?Now, in the passages I have quoted from JANE EYRE, it is clear that anger was tampering with the integrity of Charlotte Bronte the novelist.She left her story, to which her entire devotion was due, to attend to some personal grievance.She remembered that she had been starved of her proper due of experience—she had been made to stagnate in a parsonage mending stockings when she wanted to wander free over the world.Her imagination swerved from indignation and we feel it swerve.But there were many more influences than anger tugging at her imagination and deflecting it from its path.Ignorance, for instance.The portrait of Rochester is drawn in the dark.We feel the influence of fear in it; just as we constantly feel an acidity which is the result of oppression, a buried suffering smouldering beneath her passion, a rancour which contracts those books, splendid as they are, with a spasm of pain."
"既然小说和真实的生活有这种一致性，那小说的价值观在某种程度上就是真实生活的价值观。不过很显然，妇女的价值观常常和男人创造的价值观不同，这很自然。然而，占上风的是男人的价值观。说白了就是，足球和运动“重要”，崇尚时尚、买衣服就是“小事”。这些价值观不可避免地由生活转移到小说上去。批评家断定这是一本重要的书，因为它写的是战争。这是一本无意义的书，因为它写的是客厅里的女人的情感。战场上的情景比店铺里的情景更重要——价值观的区别随处可见，并且更加微妙。因此，对于女作家，十九世纪初期小说的整体结构是由这样的思想构建的，它稍稍偏离直道，为了尊重外界的权威而改变自己清晰的构想。只要大略看看那些被人忘记的旧小说，听听写那些小说的语调，就可以看出作者当时遭到了批评，她通过挑衅或者安抚的方式表达出了这些。她承认自己“仅是一个女子”，或是抗议说自己“和男子一样优秀”。她随自己性情的指引来面对批评，或是顺从羞怯，或是愤怒强烈。是哪种都没有关系，她在想事情本身之外的东西。她的书压到我们头上来。书的中心有一个缺陷。我想起所有女作家的小说，它们就像果园里有麻子的小苹果一样，散落在伦敦的二手书店里。中心的缺陷使它们腐烂了。她为了遵从别人的意见而改变了自己的价值观。","And since a novel has this correspondence to real life, its values are to some extent those of real life.But it is obvious that the values of women differ very often from the values which have been made by the other sex; naturally, this is so. Yet it is the masculine values that prevail.Speaking crudely, football and sport are ‘important’; the worship of fashion, the buying of clothes ‘trivial’.And these values are inevitably transferred from life to fiction.This is an important book, the critic assumes, because it deals with war.This is an insignificant book because it deals with the feelings of women in a drawing-room.A scene in a battle-field is more important than a scene in a shop—everywhere and much more subtly the difference of value persists.The whole structure, therefore, of the early nineteenth-century novel was raised, if one was a woman, by a mind which was slightly pulled from the straight, and made to alter its clear vision in deference to external authority.One has only to skim those old forgotten novels and listen to the tone of voice in which they are written to divine that the writer was meeting criticism; she was saying this by way of aggression, or that by way of conciliation.She was admitting that she was ‘only a woman’, or protesting that she was ‘as good as a man’.She met that criticism as her temperament dictated, with docility and diffidence, or with anger and emphasis.It does not matter which it was; she was thinking of something other than the thing itself.Down comes her book upon our heads.There was a flaw in the centre of it.And I thought of all the women’s novels that lie scattered, like small pock-marked apples in an orchard, about the second-hand book shops of London.It was the flaw in the centre that had rotted them.She had altered her values in deference to the opinion of others."
"不过她们既不向左移动一点儿，也不向右移动一点，这在当时是多么不可能的事情啊！在那个纯粹由男人统治的社会里，面对那些批评，需要何等的天赋、何等的正直才能毫不畏缩地完全忠于她们所看到的东西。只有简·奥斯汀和埃米莉·勃朗特做到了。这又是她们的另一项卓越成就，或许是最杰出的成就。她们像女人那样写作，而不是像男人那样。当时，写小说的上千个女人中，只有她们完全不理会那些永远在卖弄学问的教师，这些教师没完没了地给出忠告——该写这个，该想那个。只有她们对那反复出现的声音充耳不闻。那声音时而抱怨，时而高人一等，时而专横，时而伤心，时而震惊，时而愤怒，时而慈爱；它永远不会让女人单独静一静，而是像某个过于尽责的家庭女教师那样伴随她们，像埃杰顿·布里奇斯爵士那样恳求她们要优雅；甚至在批评诗的时候，它也要把对性别的批评拉进来；[9] 它劝告她们，若要表现良好而且赢得——据我猜测——闪闪发光的奖赏的话，就不要越过刚才那位先生所认为的恰当的界限——“……女小说家只有勇敢地承认女性的局限，才能追求卓越”。[10]这是用一句话概括了问题。如果我告诉你们，完全出乎你们的意料，这句话并不是写在一八二八年八月，而是写在一九二八年八月，我想你们一定会同意，无论目前我们有多喜欢它，它都代表着一大群人的意见，一个世纪前这一意见要铿锵有力、坦率激昂得多——我不是要去算旧账，只是拿起碰巧漂到我脚边的东西。一八二八年，若有一个女人能漠视所有的冷落、责骂和关于奖赏的承诺，那她必须非常坚毅。一个人差不多得是个煽动叛乱的人，他才会对自己说：哦，不过他们不能把文学也买走。文学是对每个人开放的。尽管你是教区执事，我也不会让你把我赶出草地。如果你乐意，你就锁上你的图书馆，但是你不能用门、用锁、用门闩禁锢我自由的思想。","But how impossible it must have been for them not to budge either to the right or to the left.What genius, what integrity it must have required in face of all that criticism, in the midst of that purely patriarchal society, to hold fast to the thing as they saw it without shrinking.Only Jane Austen did it and Emily Bronte.It is another feather, perhaps the finest, in their caps.They wrote as women write, not as men write.Of all the thousand women who wrote novels then, they alone entirely ignored the perpetual admonitions of the eternal pedagogue—write this, think that.They alone were deaf to that persistent voice, now grumbling, now patronizing, now domineering, now grieved, now shocked, now angry, now avuncular, that voice which cannot let women alone, but must be at them, like some too-conscientious governess, adjuring them, like Sir Egerton Brydges, to be refined; dragging even into the criticism of poetry criticism of sex;[9] admonishing them, if they would be good and win, as I suppose, some shiny prize, to keep within certain limits which the gentleman in question thinks suitable—‘…female novelists should only aspire to excellence by courageously acknowledging the limitations of their sex’.[10]That puts the matter in a nutshell, and when I tell you, rather to your surprise, that this sentence was written not in August 1828 but in August 1928, you will agree, I think, that however delightful it is to us now, it represents a vast body of opinion—I am not going to stir those old pools; I take only what chance has floated to my feet—that was far more vigorous and far more vocal a century ago. It would have needed a very stalwart young woman in 1828 to disregard all those snubs and chidings and promises of prizes.One must have been something of a firebrand to say to oneself, Oh, but they can’t buy literature too. Literature is open to everybody.I refuse to allow you, Beadle though you are, to turn me off the grass.Lock up your libraries if you like; but there is no gate, no lock, no bolt, that you can set upon the freedom of my mind."
"但是无论挫折和批评对她们的写作起了什么作用（我相信起了很大作用），比起她们把想法写到纸上时所遇到的其他困难（我还在想那些十九世纪初的小说家），那都不算什么。那时她们背后没有传统，或者说传统如此短暂，而且不完整，因此没什么用处。因为如果我们是女人的话，只能通过我们的母亲去回想。向伟大的男作家寻求帮助是没用的，即使我们常常从他们那里寻找乐趣。拉姆、布朗、萨克雷、纽曼、斯特恩、狄更斯、德昆西——不论是谁——从来没有帮助过女人，尽管她学到了一点他们的技巧，并加以利用。男人的思想的重量、速度、步子都太不像她自己的了，所以她不能成功地从他那里取得任何实在的东西。她离得太远了，根本无法模仿他。或许当她拿起笔在纸上写的时候，她发现的第一件事情就是没有一句现成的常用句子可以用。所有伟大的小说家，像萨克雷、狄更斯还有巴尔扎克，他们写的散文都很自然，写得快却并不马虎，表达力强却并不矫揉造作，具有他们各自的色彩却又有共性。他们的文章都基于当时通用的语句。在十九世纪初，通用的语句或许是这样的：“他们的著作的伟大之处在于，这些作品有一个主旨，它们不是突然刹住车，而是不断延伸下去。没有什么比运用他们的技巧以及不断产生真和美更让他们兴奋和满足的了。成功激发人努力，习惯促使人成功。”那是一个男人的句子；在它的背后，人们能看到约翰逊、吉本和其他人。这是一个不适合女人使用的句子。夏洛特·勃朗特在散文上有极大的天赋，但也由于手里拿着那个笨拙的武器而绊了一下跌倒了。乔治·艾略特因此而犯的大错不是笔墨所能描述的。简·奥斯汀看看它，嘲笑它，并且发明了一种完全自然、结构上很有美感、适合她自己使用的语句，并且从来没有偏离。因此，虽然她比夏洛特·勃朗特写作的天赋差，而她却表达出了比她多得多的东西。确实，表达的自由和完整是写作技巧的精髓，所以传统的缺失、工具的缺乏和不足肯定对女人的写作有极大的影响。此外，一本书不是由句子首尾相连组成的，如果借助图像，它就是由搭成拱廊和圆屋顶的句子组成的。这种形式也是男人为了自己的需要发明出来供自己使用的。没有理由认为史诗或是诗剧的形式会比句子更适合女人。但是在她成为作家的时候，之前所有的文学形式都已成形并固定下来了。只有小说还年轻，在她手里柔软可塑，这或许是她写小说的另一个理由。但是甚至到现在，谁能说“小说”（我给它加上引号，以表明我认为这个词不恰当），这个所有形式中最容易塑造的形式已经成形，适合她使用？无疑，等她能自由运用四肢的时候，我们会看到她把小说敲打成形供自己所用，而且为她内心的诗兴提供某种新载体，这个载体不一定是诗。因为是她的诗兴仍然得不到抒发。我继续沉思，现如今，怎会有女人去写一部五幕的诗歌体悲剧？她会用诗写吗？她会宁可不用散文吗？","But whatever effect discouragement and criticism had upon their writing—and I believe that they had a very great effect—that was unimportant compared with the other difficulty which faced them (I was still considering those early nineteenth-century novelists) when they came to set their thoughts on paper—that is that they had no tradition behind them, or one so short and partial that it was of little help.For we think back through our mothers if we are women.It is useless to go to the great men writers for help, however much one may go to them for pleasure.Lamb, Browne, Thackeray, Newman, Sterne, Dickens, De Quincey—whoever it may be—never helped a woman yet, though she may have learnt a few tricks of them and adapted them to her use.The weight, the pace, the stride of a man’s mind are too unlike her own for her to lift anything substantial from him successfully.The ape is too distant to be sedulous.Perhaps the first thing she would find, setting pen to paper, was that there was no common sentence ready for her use.All the great novelists like Thackeray and Dickens and Balzac have written a natural prose, swift but not slovenly, expressive but not precious, taking their own tint without ceasing to be common property.They have based it on the sentence that was current at the time.The sentence that was current at the beginning of the nineteenth century ran something like this perhaps: ‘The grandeur of their works was an argument with them, not to stop short, but to proceed.They could have no higher excitement or satisfaction than in the exercise of their art and endless generations of truth and beauty.Success prompts to exertion; and habit facilitates success.’ That is a man’s sentence; behind it one can see Johnson, Gibbon and the rest.It was a sentence that was unsuited for a woman’s use.Charlotte Bronte, with all her splendid gift for prose, stumbled and fell with that clumsy weapon in her hands.George Eliot committed atrocities with it that beggar description.Jane Austen looked at it and laughed at it and devised a perfectly natural, shapely sentence proper for her own use and never departed from it.Thus, with less genius for writing than Charlotte Bronte, she got infinitely more said.Indeed, since freedom and fullness of expression are of the essence of the art, such a lack of tradition, such a scarcity and inadequacy of tools, must have told enormously upon the writing of women.Moreover, a book is not made of sentences laid end to end, but of sentences built, if an image helps, into arcades or domes.And this shape too has been made by men out of their own needs for their own uses.There is no reason to think that the form of the epic or of the poetic play suit a woman any more than the sentence suits her.But all the older forms of literature were hardened and set by the time she became a writer.The novel alone was young enough to be soft in her hands another reason, perhaps, why she wrote novels.Yet who shall say that even now ‘the novel’ (I give it inverted commas to mark my sense of the words’ inadequacy), who shall say that even this most pliable of all forms is rightly shaped for her use?No doubt we shall find her knocking that into shape for herself when she has the free use of her limbs; and providing some new vehicle, not necessarily in verse, for the poetry in her.For it is the poetry that is still denied outlet.And I went on to ponder how a woman nowadays would write a poetic tragedy in five acts.Would she use verse?—would she not use prose rather?"
"不过这些都是伏在未来的曙光里的难题。这些难题会促使我偏离主题而走到无路可走的森林里，我会迷路并且很有可能被野兽吞食，光是出于这个原因，我也要先把它们放下。我不想——而且我确信你们也不想让我——谈起那个使人消沉的话题，即小说的未来。所以我只是在这里暂停片刻，吸引你们注意——考虑到妇女的身体状况——一定会对小说的未来起很大作用的东西。不管怎么样，书得适应身体状况，而且，人们可以随意地说，女人的书应该比男人的更短、更集中，而且结构也应该适合女性的身体状况，这样她们就不需要很长时间不间断地持续工作。因为总是会有事情打扰她们写作。此外，那些支持大脑的神经，男女似乎也不同。假如你让这些神经竭尽全力地努力工作，你必须找出合适的方式对待它们，譬如说这几个小时的演讲——演讲大概是几百年前僧侣们发明出来的——是否适合它们，它们需要工作和休息怎么交替，休息的意思不是什么都不做而是做一些事情，一些不同的事，那么不同的事情又是什么呢？所有的这些都应该被讨论、被发现；所有这些都是妇女和小说这一问题的一部分。可是，当我走近书架，我又想，在哪儿可以找到一个女人所做的关于女人心理的详尽研究呢？如果因为女人不能踢足球，就不允许她们行医的话——","But these are difficult questions which lie in the twilight of the future.I must leave them, if only because they stimulate me to wander from my subject into trackless forests where I shall be lost and, very likely, devoured by wild beasts.I do not want, and I am sure that you do not want me, to broach that very dismal subject, the future of fiction.So that I will only pause here one moment to draw your attention to the great part which must be played in that future so far as women are concerned by physical conditions.The book has somehow to be adapted to the body, and at a venture one would say that women’s books should be shorter, more concentrated, than those of men, and framed so that they do not need long hours of steady and uninterrupted work.For interruptions there will always be.Again, the nerves that feed the brain would seem to differ in men and women, and if you are going to make them work their best and hardest, you must find out what treatment suits them—whether these hours of lectures, for instance, which the monks devised, presumably, hundreds of years ago, suit them—what alternations of work and rest they need, interpreting rest not as doing noting but as doing something but something that is different; and what should that difference be?All this should be discussed and discovered; all this is part of the question of women and fiction.And yet, I continued, approaching the bookcase again, where shall I find that elaborate study of the psychology of women by a woman?If through their incapacity to play football women are not going to be allowed to practise medicine—"
"幸运的是，我的思绪现在又转向了另一个问题。","Happily my thoughts were now given another turn."
"第五章","CHAPTER FIVE"
"就这样四处闲逛着，我最终走到了一个书架前，上面陈列着依然健在的作家的作品，有女作家的，也有男作家的，因为现在女人写的书差不多和男人一样多。或者，如果这种说法不是很对，如果男性仍然是更健谈的性别，那毫无疑问的就是，女人写的不再仅仅是小说而已。书架上有简·哈里森关于希腊考古学的书，有弗农·李关于美学的书，有格特鲁德·贝尔关于波斯的书。书架上有各种各样的书，而在一代人之前，没有女人可以接触到这些主题。有诗歌、戏剧和文艺评论，有历史、传记、游记以及学术成就和调查研究方面的著作，甚至还有少许哲学和科学、经济学的书。虽然还是小说占优势，但是小说和其他种类的书相关联，其自身也很有可能和以前大不相同了。那种自然和简单——女人写作史上的史诗时代，可能已经成为过去了。可能阅读与评论给了她更宽的领域和更多的精妙之处。想写自传的那种冲动恐怕已经耗尽了。她也许开始把写作当成一种艺术，而不是一种自我表达的方法。在这些新小说中，人们可能会找到这样的一些问题的答案。","I had come at last, in the course of this rambling, to the shelves which hold books by the living; by women and by men; for there are almost as many books written by women now as by men.Or if that is not yet quite true, if the male is still the voluble sex, it is certainly true that women no longer write novels solely.There are Jane Harrison’s books on Greek archaeology; Vernon Lee’s books on aesthetics; Gertrude Bell’s books on Persia.There are books on all sorts of subjects which a generation ago no woman could have touched.There are poems and plays and criticism; there are histories and biographies, books of travel and books of scholarship and research; there are even a few philosophies and books about science and economics.And though novels predominate, novels themselves may very well have changed from association with books of a different feather.The natural simplicity, the epic age of women’s writing, may have gone.Reading and criticism may have given her a wider range, a greater subtlety.The impulse towards autobiography may be spent.She may be beginning to use writing as an art, not as a method of selfexpression.Among these new novels one might find an answer to several such questions."
"我随便拿下其中一本来。它就立在书架的末端，叫做《人生的冒险》，或者是类似的名字，是玛丽·卡迈克尔写的，而且就是在这个十月份出版的。我心里想，这好像是她的第一本著作，不过应该把它当作一个相当长的系列里的最后一册来读，它接在我在看的那些书后面——温奇尔西夫人的诗、阿芙拉·贝英的戏剧，还有那四位伟大的小说家的小说。因为书籍是彼此的延伸，尽管我们习惯将它们分开来评论。我一定要把她——这位不相识的女士——当作别的那些女性的后裔来看，我一直在扫视那些人所处的环境，要看看她从她们的特点和所受的束缚那儿继承了什么。我叹了口气，因为小说提供的往往是止痛药而不是解毒剂，它让人陷入昏昏沉沉的睡眠中，而不是用滚烫的烙铁把人惊醒。我坐下来，拿了一本笔记本和一支铅笔，尽量从玛丽·卡迈克尔的第一部小说《人生的冒险》中了解到一些东西。","I took down one of them at random.It stood at the very end of the shelf, was called LIFE’S ADVENTURE, or some such title, by Mary Carmichael, and was published in this very month of October.It seems to be her first book, I said to myself, but one must read it as if it were the last volume in a fairly long series, continuing all those other books that I have been glancing at—Lady Winchilsea’s poems and Aphra Behn’s plays and the novels of the four great novelists.For books continue each other, in spite of our habit of judging them separately.And I must also consider her—this unknown woman—as the descendant of all those other women whose circumstances I have been glancing at and see what she inherits of their characteristics and restrictions.So, with a sigh, because novels so often provide an anodyne and not an antidote, glide one into torpid slumbers instead of rousing one with a burning brand, I settled down with a notebook and a pencil to make what I could of Mary Carmichael’s first novel, LIFE’S ADVENTURE."
"首先，我把这一页上下浏览了一遍。我说，我要先弄懂她句子的含义，然后再去记住蓝眼睛、棕眼睛，还有克洛艾和罗杰之间可能存在的关系。我要先决定她手里拿的是一支笔还是一个镐，然后才有时间管那些。所以我试着读了一两个句子。很快就发现，有些东西明显不太妥当。句子与句子之间的那种平滑的过渡被打断了。有东西被撕破了，有东西被划伤了；这里一个字、那里一个字就像火把一样在我眼前闪耀。她在“解放”她自己，就像她们在老剧本里所说的。我想，她就像在划一根划不着的火柴。但是为什么呢？我问她，好像她就在我面前，为什么简·奥斯汀的句子对你来说不是合适的形式？难道因为埃玛和伍德豪斯先生死了，这些句子就都要被抛弃吗？唉，我叹气道，这样真是太可惜了！简·奥斯汀写出一个又一个旋律，就像莫扎特写出一首又一首歌一样，而读这本书却像乘着一艘没有甲板的船出海。人忽而升了上去，忽而沉了下来。这种简洁，这种扼要，可能表明她害怕什么东西，或许是害怕别人说她“伤感”，或者是她想起，人们一直说女人的作品辞藻华丽，因此加了一些多余的刺。不过直到我比较仔细地读过一节，我才能确信她是她本人还是其他人。我更仔细地读起来，心想，无论如何，她并没有降低人们的热情。不过她堆积了太多的事实。在这么长的一本书里，她连那些事实的一半都用不到。（那书只有《简·爱》的一半长。）然而，通过某种方法，她成功地把我们——罗杰、克洛艾、奥利维娅、托尼还有比格姆先生——全装在了一条独木舟里，往河流上游驶去。等一下，我坐在椅子上往后靠了靠说，我得更仔细地把整个东西都考虑一下才能进入下一步。","To begin with, I ran my eye up and down the page.I am going to get the hang of her sentences first, I said, before I load my memory with blue eyes and brown and the relationship that there may be between Chloe and Roger.There will be time for that when I have decided whether she has a pen in her hand or a pickaxe.So I tried a sentence or two on my tongue.Soon it was obvious that something was not quite in order.The smooth gliding of sentence after sentence was interrupted.Something tore, something scratched; a single word here and there flashed its torch in my eyes.She was ‘unhanding’ herself as they say in the old plays.She is like a person striking a match that will not light, I thought.But why, I asked her as if she were present, are Jane Austen’s sentences not of the right shape for you?Must they all be scrapped because Emma and Mr Woodhouse are dead?Alas, I sighed, that it should be so.For while Jane Austen breaks from melody to melody as Mozart from song to song, to read this writing was like being out at sea in an open boat.Up one went, down one sank.This terseness, this short-windedness, might mean that she was afraid of something; afraid of being called ’sentimental’ perhaps; or she remembers that women’s writing has been called flowery and so provides a superfluity of thorns; but until I have read a scene with some care, I cannot be sure whether she is being herself or someone else.At any rate, she does not lower one’s vitality, I thought, reading more carefully.But she is heaping up too many facts.She will not be able to use half of them in a book of this size.(It was about half the length of JANE EYRE.)However, by some means or other she succeeded in getting us all—Roger, Chloe, Olivia, Tony and Mr Bigham—in a canoe up the river.Wait a moment, I said, leaning back in my chair, I must consider the whole thing more carefully before I go any further."
"我暗想，我几乎确定玛丽·卡迈克尔在跟我们开玩笑。我的感觉就像是在铁路的之字爬坡路线上，以为车厢要向下沉，谁知它却一个急转弯又升了上来。玛丽正在窜改预期的次序。首先她拆分了句子，现在她又打乱了次序。那好吧，她完全有权去做这两样事情，如果她不是为了破坏，而是为了创造。到底是破坏还是创造，要等到她写到一个复杂紧要的情节，我才能确定。我说，我会给她全部的自由，让她去选择那将会是何种情节。只要她愿意，她可以用锡罐和破壶来制造出那个情节。但是，她必须让我信服，她相信那是一个复杂紧要的情节，而且，把这个情节制造出来后，她就必须面对它。她一定得跳。我决定对她尽我作为读者的义务，只要她对我尽到作为作者的义务，于是我翻过那一页读起来……很抱歉，我如此突然地停了下来。是不是没有男人在场？你们敢保证在那边红帘幕的后面没有隐藏着查尔斯·拜伦爵士的身影吗？你们能向我保证在场的全是女人吗？那么我可以告诉你们，我接着读到的内容就是“克洛艾喜欢奥利维娅”。不要吃惊。不要脸红。让我们私底下在自己的社交圈子里承认，这类事情有时是会发生的。有的时候女人确实喜欢女人。","I am almost sure, I said to myself, that Mary Carmichael is playing a trick on us.For I feel as one feels on a switchback railway when the car, instead of sinking, as one has been led to expect, swerves up again.Mary is tampering with the expected sequence.First she broke the sentence; now she has broken the sequence.Very well, she has every right to do both these things if she does them not for the sake of breaking, but for the sake of creating.Which of the two it is I cannot be sure until she has faced herself with a situation.I will give her every liberty, I said, to choose what that situation shall be; she shall make it of tin cans and old kettles if she likes; but she must convince me that she believes it to be a situation; and then when she has made it she must face it.She must jump.And, determined to do my duty by her as reader if she would do her duty by me as writer, I turned the page and read... I am sorry to break off so abruptly.Are there no men present?Do you promise me that behind that red curtain over there the figure of Sir Charles Biron is not concealed?We are all women you assure me?Then I may tell you that the very next words I read were these—‘Chloe liked Olivia...’ Do not start.Do not blush.Let us admit in the privacy of our own society that these things sometimes happen.Sometimes women do like women."
"“克洛艾喜欢奥利维娅。”我读道。然后我忽然想起，这里有一个多么大的变化。克洛艾喜欢奥利维娅或许在文学史上是第一次。克娄巴特拉没有喜欢屋大维娅。假若她喜欢她，那《安东尼与克娄巴特拉》就会完全变了样。让我的思维稍稍偏离《人生的冒险》，我想，实际上，整个事情被简化了，被荒唐地惯例化了——如果人们敢于用“荒唐”来形容的话。克娄巴特拉对于屋大维娅唯一的情感就是妒忌。她比我高吗？她怎样梳她的头发？剧本也许不再需要别的了。不过假使这两个女人之间的关系更复杂一点，那该多么有意思啊？我迅速地记起小说中光彩夺目那群女人，心想，女人之间的这些关系都太简单。很多东西都不曾顾及，未曾尝试。我尽力回想，在我所读过的书中有没有两个女人被写成是朋友。在《十字路口的黛安娜》里有过一次这样的尝试。当然，在拉辛的悲剧和希腊悲剧里，她们是知己。偶尔她们是母女。不过差不多绝无例外，写的都是她们与男人的关系。想起来很奇怪，在简·奥斯汀之前，小说里所有的伟大女性都是通过异性得到理解的，而且仅仅是通过与异性的关系而得到理解。那是女人生活里多么小的一部分啊，而且透过性别戴在他鼻子上的黑色或是玫瑰色眼镜，一个男人甚至对这一小部分都了解得多么少。也许正因为如此，才有了小说里女人的奇怪性格，有了她美貌和可怕这两个惊人的极端，有了她在天堂般的善良和地狱般的堕落之间的交替——因为一个情人就是这样依照他爱情道路上的起起伏伏、幸运与不幸来理解女人的。当然，十九世纪的小说家所写的并非完全如此。十九世纪的小说中，女人变得更加多样、复杂得多。确实，也许是想写女人导致男人渐渐地放弃了写诗剧，而发明小说，把小说看作更合适的容器。诗剧太狂热，能用到女人的地方很少。虽然如此，男人对女人的认识明显还是非常受限制，而且带着偏见，就像女人对男人的认识一样，甚至在普鲁斯特的作品中也是如此。","‘Chloe liked Olivia,’ I read.And then it struck me how immense a change was there.Chloe liked Olivia perhaps for the first time in literature.Cleopatra did not like Octavia.And how completely ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA would have been altered had she done so! As it is, I thought, letting my mind, I am afraid, wander a little from LIFE’S ADVENTURE, the whole thing is simplified, conventionalized, if one dared say it, absurdly.Cleopatra’s only feeling about Octavia is one of jealousy.Is she taller than I am?How does she do her hair?The play, perhaps, required no more.But how interesting it would have been if the relationship between the two women had been more complicated.All these relationships between women, I thought, rapidly recalling the splendid gallery of fictitious women, are too simple.So much has been left out, unattempted.And I tried to remember any case in the course of my reading where two women are represented as friends.There is an attempt at it in DIANA OF THE CROSSWAYS.They are confidantes, of course, in Racine and the Greek tragedies.They are now and then mothers and daughters.But almost without exception they are shown in their relation to men.It was strange to think that all the great women of fiction were, until Jane Austen’s day, not only seen by the other sex, but seen only in relation to the other sex.And how small a part of a woman’s life is that; and how little can a man know even of that when he observes it through the black or rosy spectacles which sex puts upon his nose.Hence, perhaps, the peculiar nature of woman in fiction; the astonishing extremes of her beauty and horror; her alternations between heavenly goodness and hellish depravity—for so a lover would see her as his love rose or sank, was prosperous or unhappy.This is not so true of the nineteenth-century novelists, of course.Woman becomes much more various and complicated there.Indeed it was the desire to write about women perhaps that led men by degrees to abandon the poetic drama which, with its violence, could make so little use of them, and to devise the novel as a more fitting receptacle.Even so it remains obvious, even in the writing of Proust, that a man is terribly hampered and partial in his knowledge of women, as a woman in her knowledge of men."
"而且，我再次低头看着这一页时继续想，除了对家庭生活一直有兴趣之外，女人明显也像男人一样有许多别的兴趣。“克洛艾喜欢奥利维娅。她们合用一个实验室……”我接着看下去，发现这两个年轻的女人在那里切动物肝脏，肝脏好像可以治恶性贫血，不过其中一个人已经结了婚，而且有两个很小的小孩子——我想我的陈述是正确的。当然，这些事全部都应当省略掉，于是小说中的女人那光彩夺目的肖像就变得过于简单、过于单调了。例如，假设男人在文学里的形象只是女人的情人，而从来不是男人的朋友，不是士兵、思想家、梦想家，那莎士比亚的剧本里能分配给他们的角色该多么地少啊，文学会受到多么大的损失啊！也许大部分奥赛罗仍会被保留下来，我们还会有很多安东尼，可是就不会有恺撒、布鲁图、哈姆雷特、李尔和杰奎斯——文学就会贫乏得令人难以置信。确实，因为将女人拒之门外，文学的贫乏已经超出了我们的估计。女人很不情愿地嫁人，被关在一间屋子里，做一样事情，这样一来，剧作家怎么能描写出她们完整、有趣或是真实的形象呢？爱情是唯一可能的解读途径。诗人不得不满怀热情或是满腹牢骚，除非他确实要“恨女人”，那就是说，他多半是在女人眼中没什么吸引力。","Also, I continued, looking down at the page again, it is becoming evident that women, like men, have other interests besides the perennial interests of domesticity.‘Chloe liked Olivia.They shared a laboratory together....’I read on and discovered that these two young women were engaged in mincing liver, which is, it seems, a cure for pernicious anaemia; although one of them was married and had—I think I am right in stating—two small children.Now all that, of course, has had to be left out, and thus the splendid portrait of the fictitious woman is much too simple and much too monotonous.Suppose, for instance, that men were only represented in literature as the lovers of women, and were never the friends of men, soldiers, thinkers, dreamers; how few parts in the plays of Shakespeare could be allotted to them; how literature would suffer!We might perhaps have most of Othello; and a good deal of Antony; but no Caesar, no Brutus, no Hamlet, no Lear, no Jaques—literature would be incredibly impoverished, as indeed literature is impoverished beyond our counting by the doors that have been shut upon women.Married against their will, kept in one room, and to one occupation, how could a dramatist give a full or interesting or truthful account of them?Love was the only possible interpreter.The poet was forced to be passionate or bitter, unless indeed he chose to ‘hate women’, which meant more often than not that he was unattractive to them."
"如果克洛艾喜欢奥利维娅而且她们合用一间实验室，这件事本身就会使她们的友谊更丰富、更持久，因为这份友谊没那么涉及隐私；如果玛丽·卡迈克尔知道如何去写，而我又开始欣赏她风格中的某些东西；如果她有一个自己的房间，虽然这个我不大确定；如果她每年有属于自己的五百镑——这也有待查证——那么我想，某件非常重要的事情就发生了。","Now if Chloe likes Olivia and they share a laboratory, which of itself will make their friendship more varied and lasting because it will be less personal; if Mary Carmichael knows how to write, and I was beginning to enjoy some quality in her style; if she has a room to herself, of which I am not quite sure; if she has five hundred a year of her own—but that remains to be proved—then I think that something of great importance has happened."
"因为如果克洛艾喜欢奥利维娅，而且玛丽·卡迈克尔知道如何去表达，那她就会在那间从未有人去过的大房间里燃起一支火炬。那里原来只有些朦胧的光和很深的阴影，像那些蜿蜒的山洞，一个人拿着蜡烛走进去，上上下下仔细地看，不知道自己走到了哪里。我又看起了那本书，读到克洛艾看着奥利维娅把一个罐子放到架子上去，并跟她说该回家到孩子们身边去了。我惊呼道，这个情景是开天辟地以来从未有人看见过的。我也很好奇地注视着。因为我想看看玛丽·卡迈克尔是如何着手抓住那些未被记录的手势，以及那些没有说出来或是没有完全说出来的话语，当女人和女人单独在一起，没有被男人变化无常、带有偏见的光芒照耀时，这些手势和话语就会自动形成，像天花板上飞蛾的影子一样不易察觉。我继续往下看，说道，如果她要这样做的话，就必须屏住呼吸。因为凡是背后没有明显动机的兴趣，女人都会表示怀疑，而且她们早就习惯了掩饰和隐瞒，因此一旦有观察的目光向她们那个方向一闪，她们就会停下来。我就对玛丽·卡迈克尔说——好像她就在我面前，我想，你做到这一点的唯一方法就是谈些别的事，同时沉着地看着窗外，然后去记录，当奥利维娅——这个有机这一百万年以来都呆在石头的阴影下——感觉到光照在石头下面，并且看见一块很奇怪的食物被送过来——那是知识、冒险经历和艺术，这个时候发生了什么。记录的时候不是用铅笔在笔记本上记，而是要用最简略的速记，用几乎从未用音节表示过的词去记。我又一次从书中抬起头来，心想，她伸出手去拿那食物，而且必须将自己各方面能力进行全新组合——这些能力已经因为其他的目的得到了高度发展，以便于把新东西吸收到旧的里面去，而又不打破整体上无比复杂、无比精巧的平衡。","For if Chloe likes Olivia and Mary Carmichael knows how to express it she will light a torch in that vast chamber where nobody has yet been.It is all half lights and profound shadows like those serpentine caves where one goes with a candle peering up and down, not knowing where one is stepping.And I began to read the book again, and read how Chloe watched Olivia put a jar on a shelf and say how it was time to go home to her children.That is a sight that has never been seen since the world began, I exclaimed.And I watched too, very curiously.For I wanted to see how Mary Carmichael set to work to catch those unrecorded gestures, those unsaid or half-said words, which form themselves, no more palpably than the shadows of moths on the ceiling, when women are alone, unlit by the capricious and coloured light of the other sex.She will need to hold her breath, I said, reading on, if she is to do it; for women are so suspicious of any interest that has not some obvious motive behind it, so terribly accustomed to concealment and suppression, that they are off at the flicker of an eye turned observingly in their direction.The only way for you to do it, I thought, addressing Mary Carmichael as if she were there, would be to talk of something else, looking steadily out of the window, and thus note, not with a pencil in a notebook, but in the shortest of shorthand, in words that are hardly syllabled yet, what happens when Olivia this organism that has been under the shadow of the rock these million years—feels the light fall on it, and sees coming her way a piece of strange food—knowledge, adventure, art.And she reaches out for it, I thought, again raising my eyes from the page, and has to devise some entirely new combination of her resources, so highly developed for other purposes, so as to absorb the new into the old without disturbing the infinitely intricate and elaborate balance of the whole."
"不过，唉，我又做了曾决定不要做的事，我未经思考就赞美起自己的性别来。“高度发展”，“无比复杂的”，不可否认这些都是赞美的话，而赞扬自己的性别总是可疑的，往往也是愚蠢的。此外，在现在这种情况下，怎样能证明这种赞美是有道理的呢？人们不能走到地图面前，说哥伦布发现了美洲而且哥伦布是女人，不能拿起一个苹果，说牛顿发现了万有引力定律而且牛顿是女人，不能看看天空，说飞机在头上飞，而且飞机是女人发明的。墙上没有刻度来测量女人的确切高度。没有整齐地刻出每一英寸的码尺，可以用来量量好母亲的品质，量量女儿的孝心、姐妹的忠实，或是主妇的能力。即使是在现在，也几乎没有女人被分在大学的各个年级里；各种职业的磨难，陆军、海军、商业、政治、外交，几乎都没有考验过她们。即使是目前，她们也几乎是没有经过分类的。但是比如说，如果我想知道人们所了解的关于霍利·巴茨爵士的一切，我只需翻开《联合王国贵族谱系录》或是《德布雷特英国贵族年鉴》，就可以看到他获得了某某学位，拥有一所房子，有一个继承人，是某个委员会的秘书，曾任英国驻加拿大大使，接受了很多学位、职位、奖章以及其他荣誉，这些荣誉把他的功绩牢牢地印在他身上。只有上帝才能对霍利·巴茨爵士了解得更多。","But, alas, I had done what I had determined not to do; I had slipped unthinkingly into praise of my own sex.‘Highly developed’—‘infinitely intricate’—such are undeniably terms of praise, and to praise one’s own sex is always suspect, often silly; moreover, in this case, how could one justify it?One could not go to the map and say Columbus discovered America and Columbus was a woman; or take an apple and remark, Newton discovered the laws of gravitation and Newton was a woman; or look into the sky and say aeroplanes are flying overhead and aeroplanes were invented by women.There is no mark on the wall to measure the precise height of women.There are no yard measures, neatly divided into the fractions of an inch, that one can lay against the qualities of a good mother or the devotion of a daughter, or the fidelity of a sister, or the capacity of a housekeeper.Few women even now have been graded at the universities; the great trials of the professions, army and navy, trade, politics and diplomacy have hardly tested them.They remain even at this moment almost unclassified.But if I want to know all that a human being can tell me about Sir Hawley Butts, for instance, I have only to open Burke or Debrett and I shall find that he took such and such a degree; owns a hall; has an heir; was Secretary to a Board; represented Great Britain in Canada; and has received a certain number of degrees, offices, medals and other distinctions by which his merits are stamped upon him indelibly.Only Providence can know more about Sir Hawley Butts than that."
"因此，当我说女人“高度发展”、“无比复杂”的时候，我不能在惠特克的名录、《德布雷特英国贵族年鉴》，或是高等学校情况一览里找出证明来证实我的话。在这种困境中我能做什么？我又看了看书架。上面有很多人的传记，有约翰逊、歌德、卡莱尔、斯特恩、柯珀、雪莱、伏尔泰、勃朗宁，还有许多其他人。我想到，所有那些伟人都曾为某种原因仰慕过某些女人，找过她们，和她们共同生活过，信任她们，向她们求爱，写过她们，相信她们，并且表现出——只能这样描述——某种对她们的需要和依赖。我不会断言，所有的这些关系都纯粹是柏拉图式的，而且威廉·乔因森·希克斯爵士很可能也会否认。但要是我们坚持认为他们从这些关系中得到的仅仅是安慰、恭维和肉体上的快乐，那么我们就大大冤枉了这些名人。他们所得到的，很显然是男性所不能提供的东西，而且不用引用诗人那毫无疑问很狂热的语句，便可以将其进一步定义为一种刺激，一种创造力的恢复——只有女性的天赋才能带来这种创造力的恢复，恐怕这样定义也不算鲁莽把。我想，他会打开客厅或是育儿室的门，发现她可能和孩子们在一起，或者看见她膝上放了一块刺绣；无论如何，生活中某些不同的秩序和系统的中心，以及这个世界和他自己的世界之间的差异（他自己的世界也许是法庭或下议院），会立即让他精神振作、生气勃勃。接下来，即使在最简明的谈话中，也有自然产生的不同的观点重新给他干枯的思想带去养料；看到她以一种与他本人不同的方法进行创作，就会加强他的创造力，不知不觉地，他那贫瘠的头脑再次开始构思；他会找到那些当他戴上帽子拜访她时尚未琢磨出来的短语或场景。每一个约翰逊都有他的斯雷尔，紧紧抓住她也是出于这些原因。当斯雷尔和她的意大利音乐老师结了婚，约翰逊狂怒和厌恶几乎发疯，这不仅仅是由于他不能再享受在斯特雷特姆的欢乐夜，而且也是因为他的生命之光就“好像熄灭了”。","When, therefore, I say ‘highly developed’, ‘infinitely intricate’ of women, I am unable to verify my words either in Whitaker, Debrett or the University Calendar.In this predicament what can I do?And I looked at the bookcase again.There were the biographies: Johnson and Goethe and Carlyle and Sterne and Cowper and Shelley and Voltaire and Browning and many others.And I began thinking of all those great men who have for one reason or another admired, sought out, lived with, confided in, made love to, written of, trusted in, and shown what can only be described as some need of and dependence upon certain persons of the opposite sex.That all these relationships were absolutely Platonic I would not affirm, and Sir William Joynson Hicks would probably deny.But we should wrong these illustrious men very greatly if we insisted that they got nothing from these alliances but comfort, flattery and the pleasures of the body.What they got, it is obvious, was something that their own sex was unable to supply; and it would not be rash, perhaps, to define it further, without quoting the doubtless rhapsodical words of the poets, as some stimulus; some renewal of creative power which is in the gift only of the opposite sex to bestow.He would open the door of drawing-room or nursery, I thought, and find her among her children perhaps, or with a piece of embroidery on her knee—at any rate, the centre of some different order and system of life, and the contrast between this world and his own, which might be the law courts or tile House of Commons, would at once refresh and invigorate; and there would follow, even in the simplest talk, such a natural difference of opinion that the dried ideas in him would be fertilized anew; and the sight of her creating in a different medium from his own would so quicken his creative power that insensibly his sterile mind would begin to plot again, and he would find the phrase or the scene which was lacking when he put on his hat to visit her.Every Johnson has his Thrale, and holds fast to her for some such reasons as these, and when the Thrale marries her Italian music master Johnson goes half mad with rage and disgust, not merely that he will miss his pleasant evenings at Streatham, but that the light of his life will be ‘as if gone out’."
"哪怕不是约翰逊博士、歌德、卡莱尔，或者伏尔泰，一个人尽管和这些大人物有很大差别，但也会感受到女人无比复杂的天性和高度发展的创造才能的力量。一个人走进房间里——但他必须滥用英语语言的资源，并且语言的流淌必须以不符合语法的方式飞出来，这样一个女人才能说出，她走进房间时发生了什么事。房间各不相同：有的安静，有的极为喧闹；有的面朝大海，有的恰恰相反，对着监狱的院子；有的晾满衣物的；有的装饰着乳白玻璃和丝绸，显得富有生气；有的硬得像马鬃，有的软得如羽毛。一个人只要走进随便哪条街上的任何一个房间，就能感觉到女性那极其复杂的力量整个地扑面而来。怎么会是另外的样子呢？这几百万年来女人都坐在房间里，所以到现在那些墙壁都弥漫着她们的创造力。这种力量确实超出了砖瓦水泥的负荷能力，因此需要将其运用到写作、绘画、商业和政治上去。但这种创造力和男人的创造力全然不同。人们一定会得出这样的结论，假如这种创造力受到阻碍或是被浪费了的话，那是万分可惜的，因为它是经过几个世纪最严酷的磨练才赢得的，而且无可替代。假如女人也像男人那样写作或者生活，长得也像男人的话，那也是万分可惜的，因为要是两性都有不足之处，那么考虑到世界的广阔和多样，我们要是只有一种性别有怎能应付得了呢？难道教育不是应该揭示、强化两性的差异而并非相似之处吗？实际上我们有太多的相似之处，要是一位探险家回来告诉人们，其他性别的人从别的树的树枝中间看着另一片天空，那么他就是为人类做了最大的贡献，而且看着Ｘ教授跑去拿他的量尺，以证明他是“优越的”，我们获得了巨大的乐趣。","And without being Dr Johnson or Goethe or Carlyle or Voltaire, one may feel, though very differently from these great men, the nature of this intricacy and the power of this highly developed creative faculty among women.One goes into the room—but the resources of the English language would he much put to the stretch, and whole flights of words would need to wing their way illegitimately into existence before a woman could say what happens when she goes into a room.The rooms differ so completely; they are calm or thunderous; open on to the sea, or, on the contrary, give on to a prison yard; are hung with washing; or alive with opals and silks; are hard as horsehair or soft as feathers—one has only to go into any room in any street for the whole of that extremely complex force of femininity to fly in one’s face.How should it be otherwise?For women have sat indoors all these millions of years, so that by this time the very walls are permeated by their creative force, which has, indeed, so overcharged the capacity of bricks and mortar that it must needs harness itself to pens and brushes and business and politics.But this creative power differs greatly from the creative power of men.And one must conclude that it would be a thousand pities if it were hindered or wasted, for it was won by centuries of the most drastic discipline, and there is nothing to take its place.It would be a thousand pities if women wrote like men, or lived like men, or looked like men, for if two sexes are quite inadequate, considering the vastness and variety of the world, how should we manage with one only?Ought not education to bring out and fortify the differences rather than the similarities?For we have too much likeness as it is, and if an explorer should come back and bring word of other sexes looking through the branches of other trees at other skies, nothing would be of greater service to humanity; and we should have the immense pleasure into the bargain of watching Professor X rush for his measuring-rods to prove himself ‘superior’. "
"我还是在那一页上方逗留着，距离那一页一小段距离，心想玛丽·卡迈克尔会仅仅作为一个观察者来安排写作。我真怕她会因为诱惑而成为自然主义小说家，而不是好沉思的小说家，我认为自然主义小说家是小说家中比较无趣的一派。有这么多新的事实让她观察。她再也不必把自己限制在中上层阶级的体面家庭里。她不是出于仁慈才走到那些洒了香水的小房间里，而是放下了高傲的姿态，带着友好的态度走进去。那些房间里坐着交际花、娼妓和抱着哈巴狗的女人。她们坐在那里，仍然穿着不讲究的、现成的衣服，男作家必然要拍拍她们的肩膀。但玛丽·卡迈克尔却会拿出她的剪刀，让每一个角和凹陷处都适合她们。当能看到这些女人的本来面目时，那一定会是奇特的景象。不过我们还得等一会儿，因为玛丽·卡迈克尔仍然会被在“罪恶”面前的自我意识所困扰，这种“罪恶”是我们性野蛮的遗产。她脚上仍然会戴着劣质而古老的阶级脚镣。","Mary Carmichael, I thought, still hovering at a little distance above the page, will have her work cut out for her merely as an observer.I am afraid indeed that she will be tempted to become, what I think the less interesting branch of the species—the naturalist-novelist, and not the contemplative.There are so many new facts for her to observe.She will not need to limit herself any longer to the respectable houses of the upper middle classes.She will go without kindness or condescension, but in the spirit of fellowship, into those small, scented rooms where sit the courtesan, the harlot and the lady with the pug dog. There they still sit in the rough and ready-made clothes that the male writer has had perforce to clap upon their shoulders.But Mary Carmichael will have out her scissors and fit them close to every hollow and angle.It will be a curious sight, when it comes, to see these women as they are, but we must wait a little, for Mary Carmichael will still be encumbered with that self-consciousness in the presence of ‘sin’ which is the legacy of our sexual barbarity.She will still wear the shoddy old fetters of class on her feet."
"然而，大部分女人既不是娼妓，也不是交际花，而且夏天她们不会一下午都坐着，把哈巴狗紧紧抱在满是灰尘的丝绒上。那么她们都做些什么呢？河南岸的某个地方，那些长长的街道中的一条进入了我的脑海，河边一排排的房子里住着无数的人。用想象的目光，我看到一位非常年老的太太挽着一位中年女士的胳膊穿过街道，那位女士也许是她女儿吧，她们俩人都如此得体地穿着毛皮衣服和靴子，可见她们下午的打扮一定是像仪式一般隆重，而且在夏天的各个月份里，那些衣服肯定是都收在放了樟脑的橱柜里，每年都是这样。华灯初上之时，她们穿过街道（因为她们最喜欢傍晚时分），她们一定年年如此。年长的那位年近八十了，若是有人问她，一生对她而言有何意义，她会说，她还记得那些街道曾为巴拉克拉瓦之战而灯火辉煌，或者说她曾听见海德公园为国王爱德华七世的出生而鸣礼炮。若是有人想确定具体的日期和季节，于是去问她，那您在一八六八年四月五日或者一八七五年十一月二日在做些什么，她定会茫然地回答，她什么都不记得了。她煮饭，洗盘子、杯子，送孩子上学，送他们步入社会。但什么都没留下。一切都消逝了。没有传记或历史对此提过一个字。小说也不可避免地说了谎，虽然其本意并非如此。","However, the majority of women are neither harlots nor courtesans; nor do they sit clasping pug dogs to dusty velvet all through the summer afternoon.But what do they do then? and there came to my mind’s eye one of those long streets somewhere south of the river whose infinite rows are innumerably populated. With the eye of the imagination I saw a very ancient lady crossing the street on the arm of a middle-aged woman, her daughter, perhaps, both so respectably booted and furred that their dressing in the afternoon must be a ritual, and the clothes themselves put away in cupboards with camphor, year after year, throughout the summer months.They cross the road when the lamps are being lit (for the dusk is their favourite hour), as they must have done year after year.The elder is close on eighty; but if one asked her what her life has meant to her, she would say that she remembered the streets lit for the battle of Balaclava, or had heard the guns fire in Hyde Park for the birth of King Edward the Seventh.And if one asked her, longing to pin down the moment with date and season, but what were you doing on the fifth of April 1868, or the second of November 1875, she would look vague and say that she could remember nothing.For all the dinners are cooked; the plates and cups washed; the children sent to school and gone out into the world.Nothing remains of it all.All has vanished.No biography or history has a word to say about it.And the novels, without meaning to, inevitably lie."
"所有这些无比默默无闻的人生都有待记录，我这样对玛丽·卡迈克尔说，好像她就在我面前。我顺着伦敦的街道一直想下去，在想象中感觉那种不能说话的压力，感觉积累下来的那些未被记录的人生。这或许是来自站在街角、双手叉腰的女人，她们的戒指嵌到肥大臃肿的指头里，说话时的手势像莎士比亚的语言一样铿锵有力；这或许是来自卖紫罗兰和卖火柴的女孩，以及坐在门口的干瘪老太婆；这或许是来自那些流浪女孩，她们的脸像是阳光白云下的波浪，标志着男人、女人们的到来和商店橱窗里闪烁的灯光。所有那些你都得去探索，握紧你手中的火把，我对玛丽·卡迈克尔说。最重要的是，你必须照亮自己的灵魂，以及它的深沉与浅薄、虚荣与慷慨，并且讲一讲，你的美貌或是平常相貌对于你意味着什么，你和这个不断变化、日新月异的世界有什么关系。这是一个手套、鞋子和各式物品的世界，它们在药剂师瓶子散发出的淡淡气味里上下摆动，那气味沿着人工大理石地板上卖衣料的拱廊散开来。我在想象中进入了一家商店，这家店铺着黑白相间的地砖，挂着美得惊人的彩带。我想，玛丽·卡迈克尔路过时完全应该看一看，因为这种景象非常适合拿来描写，就像安第斯山脉任何一个被白雪覆盖的山峰或是布满岩石的峡谷。还有柜台后的那个女孩——与其去读拿破仑的第150部传记，或是研究济慈极其弥尔顿式倒装法的第70篇报告（老教授Z先生极其同类人正在编写），不如去了解这个女孩真实的个人经历。然后我踮着脚尖（我是如此胆小，如此害怕差点打在我肩上的鞭子），继续小心翼翼地低声说，她也应该学着以不带怨恨的方式嘲笑男人的虚荣，或者说是男人的特性，这个词比较中听一点儿。人的头背面有个一先令大小的斑点，自己永远无法看到。所以，去描述头背面那个一先令大小的斑点就成了两性间互利的好事之一。想想女人们从尤维纳利斯的意见和斯特林堡的评论中获得了多少益处啊。想一想，自古以来，男人把头背面的那块黑的地方指给女人看，是带着怎样的仁慈和智慧啊！如果玛丽非常勇敢诚实的话，那么她就该走到男人背后去，告诉我们她在那儿看到了什么。永远也画不出一个男人整体的真实画像，直到有女人描述了那个一先令大小的斑点。伍德豪斯和卡苏朋先生就是那样大小、那样性质的斑点。当然，任何理性的人都不会建议她有目的地去奚落嘲弄——文学告诉我们，以那种精神写出来的东西都是无用的。有人会说，只要真实，那么结果必定会惊人地有趣。喜剧的内容一定会得到充实。新的事实一定会被发现。","All these infinitely obscure lives remain to be recorded, I said, addressing Mary Carmichael as if she were present; and went on in thought through the streets of London feeling in imagination the pressure of dumbness, the accumulation of unrecorded life, whether from the women at the street corners with their arms akimbo, and the rings embedded in their fat swollen fingers, talking with a gesticulation like the swing of Shakespeare’s words; or from the violet-sellers and match-sellers and old crones stationed under doorways; or from drifting girls whose faces, like waves in sun and cloud, signal the coming of men and women and the flickering lights of shop windows.All that you will have to explore, I said to Mary Carmichael, holding your torch firm in your hand.Above all, you must illumine your own soul with its profundities and its shallows, and its vanities and its generosities, and say what your beauty means to you or your plainness, and what is your relation to the everchanging and turning world of gloves and shoes and stuffs swaying up and down among the faint scents that come through chemists’ bottles down arcades of dress material over a floor of pseudo-marble.For in imagination I had gone into a shop; it was laid with black and white paving; it was hung, astonishingly beautifully, with coloured ribbons.Mary Carmichael might well have a look at that in passing, I thought, for it is a sight that would lend itself to the pen as fittingly as any snowy peak or rocky gorge in the Andes.And there is the girl behind the counter too—I would as soon have her true history as the hundred and fiftieth life of Napoleon or seventieth study of Keats and his use of Miltonic inversion which old Professor Z and his like are now inditing.And then I went on very warily, on the very tips of my toes (so cowardly am I, so afraid of the lash that was once almost laid on my own shoulders), to murmur that she should also learn to laugh, without bitterness, at the vanities—say rather at the peculiarities, for it is a less offensive word—of the other sex.For there is a spot the size of a shilling at the back of the head which one can never see for oneself.It is one of the good offices that sex can discharge for sex—to describe that spot the size of a shilling at the back of the head.Think how much women have profited by the comments of Juvenal; by the criticism of Strindberg.Think with what humanity and brilliancy men, from the earliest ages, have pointed out to women that dark place at the back of the head!And if Mary were very brave and very honest, she would go behind the other sex and tell us what she found there.A true picture of man as a whole can never be painted until a woman has described that spot the size of a shilling.Mr Woodhouse and Mr Casuabon are spots of that size and nature.Not of course that anyone in their senses would counsel her to hold up to scorn and ridicule of set purpose—literature shows the futility of what is written in that spirit.Be truthful, one would say, and the result is bound to be amazingly interesting.Comedy is bound to be enriched.New facts are bound to be discovered."
"不过，的确是时候再低头看看这一页了。最好还是看看玛丽·卡迈克尔事实上写了些什么，而不是去推测她可能会写什么，应该写什么。所以我又开始读起来了。我记得我对她有些不满意的地方。她分解了简·奥斯汀的语句，使得我没机会再因为自己无可挑剔的品味和极难讨好的耳朵沾沾自喜。如果我不得不承认她们之间没有相似点，那么说“是的，是的，这个好，不过简·奥斯汀比你写得好多了”也是没用的。然后她又进一步打乱了顺序——预期的次序。也许她是无意中这么做的，只是赋予事物自然的顺序，就像女人那样，如果她像女人那样写作的话。可是效果却令人多少有些困惑，人们看不到高潮，看不到有危机即将发生。因此，我就不能炫耀自己情感的深度，以及我对人心的深刻了解。每当我要在平常的地方感受平常的事情时，感受关于爱与死亡的事情时，那讨厌的家伙就把我硬扯开，好像重要的那一点就在前面不远的地方。于是，她使我不能高声说出我那些关于“基本情感”、“人类共同本质”和“人心深处”的铿锵有力的词句，还有其他那些支持我们的信念的词句。我们相信，无论我们表面上多么机灵，内心都是非常认真、非常深刻、非常有人情味的。相反，她却让我觉得，人不是认真、深刻、有人情味的，而是有可能思想懒惰、因循守旧——这个想法实在是太不诱人了。","However, it was high time to lower my eyes to the page again.It would be better, instead of speculating what Mary Carmichael might write and should write, to see what in fact Mary Carmichael did write.So I began to read again.I remembered that I had certain grievances against her. She had broken up Jane Austen’s sentence, and thus given me no chance of pluming myself upon my impeccable taste, my fastidious ear.  For it was useless to say, ‘Yes, yes, this is very nice; but Jane Austen wrote much better than you do’, when I had to admit that there was no point of likeness between them.Then she had gone further and broken the sequence—the expected order.Perhaps she had done this unconsciously, merely giving things their natural order, as a woman would, if she wrote like a woman.But the effect was somehow baffling; one could not see a wave heaping itself, a crisis coming round the next corner.Therefore I could not plume myself either upon the depths of my feelings and my profound knowledge of the human heart.For whenever I was about to feel the usual things in the usual places, about love, about death, the annoying creature twitched me away, as if the important point were just a little further on.And thus she made it impossible for me to roll out my sonorous phrases about ‘elemental feelings’, the ‘common stuff of humanity’, ‘the depths of the human heart’, and all those other phrases which support us in our belief that, however clever we may be on top, we are very serious, very profound and very humane underneath.She made me feel, on the contrary, that instead of being serious and profound and humane, one might be—and the thought was far less seductive—merely lazy minded and conventional into the bargain."
"但我还是继续往下读，注意到了一些别的事实。她不是天才，这是明摆着的。不像她伟大的前辈温奇尔西夫人、夏洛特·勃朗特、埃米莉·勃朗特、简·奥斯汀和乔治·艾略特，她没有那种对大自然的热爱、充满激情的想象力、狂野的情感、非凡的才智和沉思的智慧；她又不能带着多萝西·奥斯本那样的抑扬顿挫和庄严去写作。其实，她不过就是个聪明的女子，毫无疑问，十年后她的书肯定会被书商制成纸浆。尽管如此，她却有某些优势，那些天赋远高于她的女人甚至在半个世纪前就缺乏这些优势。对她来说，男人不再是“反对派”。她不必浪费时间去责骂他们，也不必爬上屋顶，因为渴望她得不到的那些旅行、经历以及关于世界和人的性格的知识而弄得自己心神不宁。在对待男性时，恐惧和憎恨几乎都已远去，或者说它们的痕迹只是在对自由的欢乐的轻微夸大中表现出来，这是一种向刻薄、讽刺的方向发展的趋势，而不是向浪漫的方向发展。那么毫无疑问，作为一名小说家，她享有上层社会的某些自然的优势。她拥有丰富、热切、自由的情感。对几乎感觉不到的触碰，它都会作出反应。就像一株刚刚来到空气中的植物，尽情享受着不期而遇的每一个景象和每一个声响。它也带着好奇轻轻地穿梭在那些未知或未被记录的事物中；它落在渺小的事物上，并且表明，也许它们其实并不渺小。它把埋藏已久的东西挖掘出来，并且让人们很纳闷，当初有什么埋藏的必要。虽然她不够灵巧，也没有在不知不觉中继承悠久的传统——这一传统使得萨克雷或拉姆那种人即使轻轻一转笔也能写出悦耳的文字，但是，我现在觉得，她已经掌握了伟大的第一课；她像一个女人那样写作，但却是一个忘记自己性别的女人，所以她的书页里充斥着那种奇特的性别特征，而这些特征只有在没有意识到自身性别时才会出现。","But I read on, and noted certain other facts.She was no ‘genius’ that was evident.She had nothing like the love of Nature, the fiery imagination, the wild poetry, the brilliant wit, the brooding wisdom of her great predecessors, Lady Winchilsea, Charlotte Bronte, Emily Bronte, Jane Austen and George Eliot; she could not write with the melody and the dignity of Dorothy Osborne—indeed she was no more than a clever girl whose books will no doubt be pulped by the publishers in ten years’ time. But, nevertheless, she had certain advantages which women of far greater gift lacked even half a century ago. Men were no longer to her ‘the opposing faction’; she need not waste her time railing against them; she need not climb on to the roof and ruin her peace of mind longing for travel, experience and a knowledge of the world and character that were denied her.Fear and hatred were almost gone, or traces of them showed only in a slight exaggeration of the joy of freedom, a tendency to the caustic and satirical, rather than to the romantic, in her treatment of the other sex.Then there could be no doubt that as a novelist she enjoyed some natural advantages of a high order.She had a sensibility that was very wide, eager and free.It responded to an almost imperceptible touch on it.It feasted like a plant newly stood in the air on every sight and sound that came its way. It ranged, too, very subtly and curiously, among almost unknown or unrecorded things; it lighted on small things and showed that perhaps they were not small after all.It brought buried things to light and made one wonder what need there had been to bury them.Awkward though she was and without the unconscious bearing of long descent which makes the least turn of the pen of a Thackeray or a Lamb delightful to the ear, she had—I began to think—mastered the first great lesson; she wrote as a woman, but as a woman who has forgotten that she is a woman, so that her pages were full of that curious sexual quality which comes only when sex is unconscious of itself."
"所有的这些都是有利的。但是，丰富的感觉或是细微的洞察力并不会有多大用处，除非她能从转瞬即逝以及个人的东西中建造出那个仍未被抛弃的永恒持久的大厦。我说过，我会一直等，直到她面对一个“复杂紧要的情节”。我的意思是说，直到她通过召唤、示意、聚集等方法，证明她不是一个只浏览表面的人，而是已经向下看到了深层次的东西。在某个时候她会对自己说，现在就是不用做出任何激烈的举动就能表现出这一切的意义的时候了。然后她就开始示意、召唤——这种复苏是多么清楚！——然后记忆里就会出现那些几乎被忘记、在别的章节里漏掉的非常琐碎的东西。她就会在某人做针线活或抽烟斗的时候使这些东西尽可能自然地出现。她继续写下去的话，人们就会感觉到自己似乎已经来到了世界之巅，并且看到整个世界在下面铺展开来，非常壮观。","All this was to the good.But no abundance of sensation or fineness of perception would avail unless she could build up out of the fleeting and the personal the lasting edifice which remains unthrown.I had said that I would wait until she faced herself with ‘a situation’.And I meant by that until she proved by summoning, beckoning and getting together that she was not a skimmer of surfaces merely, but had looked beneath into the depths.Now is the time, she would say to herself at a certain moment, when without doing anything violent I can show the meaning of all this.And she would begin—how unmistakable that quickening is!—beckoning and summoning, and there would rise up in memory, half forgotten, perhaps quite trivial things in other chapters dropped by the way. And she would make their presence felt while someone sewed or smoked a pipe as naturally as possible, and one would feel, as she went on writing, as if one had gone to the top of the world and seen it laid out, very majestically, beneath."
"无论如何，她是在尝试。当我注视着她持续地做着这个试验的时候，我看见——但希望她没发现——那些主教和教长们、博士和教授们、元老和学究们全都喊着警告她、劝她。你不能这么做，不许那样做！只有研究员和学者才能走到草坪上！女士们没有介绍信是不允许进入的！请胸怀大志、优雅的女小说家走这边。他们不断对她施加压力，就如赛马场上围栏边的人群一样，就看她能否不用左顾右盼就跨过围栏。我对她说：要是你停下来骂，那你就输掉了；要是你停下来笑，也是一样。如果犹豫不决或者笨手笨脚，你也就完了。只要想着跳，我恳求她，好像我把所有的钱都押在她身上了，而她就像小鸟那样飞过去了。可是前面还有一道又一道的围栏。我很怀疑她能否有那样的耐力，因为鼓掌和呐喊的声音令人神经紧张。可她尽力了。玛丽·卡迈克尔不是天才，不过是一个在卧室兼起居室的房间里写了第一部小说的无名女孩，像时间、金钱、闲情逸致这样的有利因素都不太具备。这样想来，我认为她也算做得不错了。","At any rate, she was making the attempt.And as I watched her lengthening out for the test, I saw, but hoped that she did not see, the bishops and the deans, the doctors and the professors, the patriarchs and the pedagogues all at her shouting warning and advice.You can’t do this and you shan’t do that!Fellows and scholars only allowed on the grass!Ladies not admitted without a letter of introduction!Aspiring and graceful female novelists this way!So they kept at her like the crowd at a fence on the racecourse, and it was her trial to take her fence without looking to right or to left.If you stop to curse you are lost, I said to her; equally, if you stop to laugh.Hesitate or fumble and you are done for.Think only of the jump, I implored her, as if I had put the whole of my money on her back; and she went over it like a bird.But there was a fence beyond that and a fence beyond that.Whether she had the staying power I was doubtful, for the clapping and the crying were fraying to the nerves.But she did her best.Considering that Mary Carmichael was no genius, but an unknown girl writing her first novel in a bed-sitting-room, without enough of those desirable things, time, money and idleness, she did not do so badly, I thought."
"读着最后一章的文字——人们的鼻子和裸露的肩膀在繁星点点的天空下显露出来，因为有人猛地拉开了客厅的窗帘——我得出了结论：如果再给她一百年，给她一个属于自己的房间，再给她每年五百英镑的收入，让她吐露心声，让她把现在写进书里的东西省掉一半，那么，她有一天会写出一本更好的书。我把玛丽·卡迈克尔的《人生的冒险》放在书架的尽头，说道，再过一百年，她会成为一位诗人。","Give her another hundred years, I concluded, reading the last chapter—people’s noses and bare shoulders showed naked against a starry sky, for someone had twitched the curtain in the drawing-room—give her a room of her own and five hundred a year, let her  speak her mind and leave out half that she now puts in, and she will write a better book one of these days.She will be a poet, I said, putting LIFE’S ADVENTURE, by Mary Carmichael, at the end of the shelf, in another hundred years’ time."
"第六章","CHAPTER SIX"
"第二天，透过没有窗帘的窗户，十月的一束束晨光夹杂着尘埃照进来，街上传来了车水马龙的声音。伦敦又一次上足了发条，工厂骚动起来，机器开始运转。读完这些以后，就想往窗外看看，看伦敦在一九二八年十月二十六日的早上做些什么。那么伦敦在做什么呢？似乎没人在读《安东尼与克娄巴特拉》。看来伦敦对莎士比亚的戏剧完全不在意。对于小说的未来、诗歌的死亡，或者一个普通女人创造的能够完全表达她思想的散文风格，人们毫不在乎——我不会责怪他们。要是用粉笔把有关这些事的见解写在人行道上，也不会有人弯腰去读的。那些冷漠的匆匆脚步会在半小时内就把它们擦去。这儿来了个供差遣的童仆，那儿有一个女人牵着条狗。伦敦街道的魅力在于，从来没有两个人是相像的，每一个人似乎都某件自己的私事。有拎着小包认真务实的人；有用手杖把庭院栏杆敲出响声的流浪汉；有把街道当作俱乐部聚会室的和蔼友善的人，他们和车里的人打招呼，不等人询问就把消息告诉他们。还有出殡的，这让人突然想起自己有一天也会死去，于是都举起帽子致哀。一位很高贵的绅士慢慢从门阶上走下来，为避免和一位匆忙的女士相撞，他停了一下。也不知用了什么法子，那位女士弄到了一件绝妙的皮大衣和一束帕尔马紫罗兰。他们看上去都各自独立，自我专注，忙着自己的事情。","Next day the light of the October morning was falling in dusty shafts through the uncurtained windows, and the hum of traffic rose from the street.London then was winding itself up again; the factory was astir; the machines were beginning.It was tempting, after all this reading, to look out of the window and see what London was doing on the morning of the 26th of October 1928.And what was London doing?Nobody, it seemed, was reading ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA.London was wholly indifferent, it appeared, to Shakespeare’s plays.Nobody cared a straw—and I do not blame them—for the future of fiction, the death of poetry or the development by the average woman of a prose style completely expressive of her mind.If opinions upon any of these matters had been chalked on the pavement, nobody would have stooped to read them.The nonchalance of the hurrying feet would have rubbed them out in half an hour.Here came an errand-boy; here a woman with a dog on a lead.The fascination of the London street is that no two people are ever alike; each seems bound on some private affair of his own.There were the business-like, with their little bags; there were the drifters rattling sticks upon area railings; there were affable characters to whom the streets serve for clubroom, hailing men in carts and giving information without being asked for it.Also there were funerals to which men, thus suddenly reminded of the passing of their own bodies, lifted their hats.And then a very distinguished gentleman came slowly down a doorstep and paused to avoid collision with a bustling lady who had, by some means or other, acquired a splendid fur coat and a bunch of Parma violets.They all seemed separate, selfabsorbed, on business of their own."
"这时，行人车辆完全静下来，暂时停住了，这种情况在伦敦常常发生。没什么东西来大街上，也没人过街了。一片叶子从街道尽头的一棵悬铃木上脱落，就在一切暂停的时候落了下来。不知怎么的，那就像来了个信号，指向人们一直没注意到的那些东西里面蕴含的力量。它似乎指向一条河流，这条河流无形地绕过转角，流过街道，卷起漩涡带走了人们，就像牛津剑桥的那条河带走了船上的大学生和落叶一样。现在它把一个穿着新颖别致的皮靴的女孩从街的一边斜着带到另一边，又带来一位穿褐红色大衣的年轻男子，还有一辆出租车。它又把这三者一同带到一个点上，就在我窗户下面。车停了，女孩和年轻男人也停下来，一起上了车，然后车静静地开走了，好像又被那条河冲到另一个地方去了。","At this moment, as so often happens in London, there was a complete lull and suspension of traffic.Nothing came down the street; nobody passed.A single leaf detached itself from the plane tree at the end of the street, and in that pause and suspension fell.Somehow it was like a signal falling, a signal pointing to a force in things which one had overlooked.It seemed to point to a river, which flowed past, invisibly, round the corner, down the street, and took people and eddied them along, as the stream at Oxbridge had taken the undergraduate in his boat and the dead leaves.Now it was bringing from one side of the street to the other diagonally a girl in patent leather boots, and then a young man in a maroon overcoat; it was also bringing a taxi-cab; and it brought all three together at a point directly beneath my window; where the taxi stopped; and the girl and the young man stopped; and they got into the taxi; and then the cab glided off as if it were swept on by the current elsewhere."
"这情景常见得很，奇怪的是我的想象赋予它的有节奏的秩序，以及这样的一个事实，即两个人坐进车里这种平常的场面也有一种力量，能将他们表面上的满足多少传达出来。我注视着那辆车拐了个弯开走了，心想，看见两个人沿街走来，在拐角碰面，这似乎缓解了心里的某种紧张情绪。这两天我一直认为一种性别与另一种性别是截然不同的，也许这样想是件费力的事吧。它妨碍了思想的协调一致。现在看到两个人走到一起坐进一辆出租车里，那费力的事就结束了，思想的协调性也恢复了。人脑真是个很神秘的器官——我边思考边把头从窗外缩回来——我们对它一无所知，却要完全依靠它。为什么我感觉头脑里有分裂和对立，就像身体因明显的原因而极度紧张一样？“思想的协调性”究竟是什么意思？我这样思考着，因为很显然，大脑具有非常巨大的力量，能在任何时候集中在任何一点上，它似乎不会只有一种单一的状态。譬如，它可以将自己和街上的人们分开，并且从高高的窗口向下望着他们，认为自己脱离了他们。或者它会不由自主地和别人一起思考，比如在人群里等着听人读出某条新闻的时候。它可以通过父亲或母亲往回思考，就像我曾说过的，写作的女人通过她的母亲往回思考。而且，一个人如果是女人的话，她就常常会因为意识的突然分裂而感到惊讶，比如走在怀特霍尔大街上的时候，她本来是那种文明的天生的继承人，此时却恰恰相反，变成了文明之外的东西，格格不入又持有批判态度。很明显，头脑总是不断改变其焦点，从不同的角度看待世界。但这些心境中有一些不如其他的舒服，即使它们是自然而然产生的。为了继续保持这样的心境，人在无意中会隐瞒一些事，渐渐地，这种压抑就变成费力的事了。不过也许也有一些心境，人可以保持这样的心境而又不必费力，因为没有需要隐瞒的东西。我从窗户那儿往里走的时候，心想，这也许就是其中一种吧。当然，当我看到那对男女一起上了出租车的时候，头脑的感觉就像是分开后又自然地融合在了一起。明显的原因就是，两性间的合作是很自然的事。人们有一种即便不理性却也根深蒂固的本能，这种本能支持一种理论，那就是男人和女人的结合能带来最大的满足和最圆满的幸福。然而两人坐进车里的场景及其给我的满足感令我还想问一下，脑中是否也有同身体相对应的两性，它们是否也需要结合起来才能拥有完满的满足和幸福呢？我进而很不熟练地草拟出一幅灵魂的示意图，于是我们每个人心中都有两种力量在起支配作用，一种是男性的，另一种是女性的。在男人的头脑中，男性力量胜过女性力量；而在女人的脑中，女性力量胜过男性力量。正常而又舒适的存在状态就是这两股力量和谐共处、精神上互相协作的时候。假如一个人是个男人，他脑中女性的那部分力量也必定在起作用；而女人肯定也与其内心的男性力量有交流。柯尔律治说一个伟大的头脑是兼有男女两性的，他的意思大概就是这个吧。只有在这种融合发生时，大脑才会彻底地充实，才能利用其全部的官能。我觉得，可能一个纯粹男性的头脑和一个纯粹女性的头脑都是不能创造的。不过最好还是暂停一下，去看一两本书，来考查一下人们在谈到有男子气的女性或者具有女子气的男性时，到底是什么意思。","The sight was ordinary enough; what was strange was the rhythmical order with which my imagination had invested it; and the fact that the ordinary sight of two people getting into a cab had the power to communicate something of their own seeming satisfaction.The sight of two people coming down the street and meeting at the corner seems to ease the mind of some strain, I thought, watching the taxi turn and make off.Perhaps to think, as I had been thinking these two days, of one sex as distinct from the other is an effort.It interferes with the unity of the mind.Now that effort had ceased and that unity had been restored by seeing two people come together and get into a taxicab.The mind is certainly a very mysterious organ, I reflected, drawing my head in from the window, about which nothing whatever is known, though we depend upon it so completely.Why do I feel that there are severances and oppositions in the mind, as there are strains from obvious causes on the body?What does one mean by ‘the unity of the mind’?I pondered, for clearly the mind has so great a power of concentrating at any point at any moment that it seems to have no single state of being.It can separate itself from the people in the street, for example, and think of itself as apart from them, at an upper window looking down on them.Or it can think with other people spontaneously, as, for instance, in a crowd waiting to hear some piece of news read out. It can think back through its fathers or through its mothers, as I have said that a woman writing thinks back through her mothers.Again if one is a woman one is often surprised by a sudden splitting off of consciousness, say in walking down Whitehall, when from being the natural inheritor of that civilization, she becomes, on the contrary, outside of it, alien and critical.Clearly the mind is always altering its focus, and bringing the world into different perspectives.But some of these states of mind seem, even if adopted spontaneously, to be less comfortable than others.In order to keep oneself continuing in them one is unconsciously holding something back, and gradually the repression becomes an effort.But there may be some state of mind in which one could continue without effort because nothing is required to be held back.And this perhaps, I thought, coming in from the window, is one of them.For certainly when I saw the couple get into the taxicab the mind felt as if, after being divided, it had come together again in a natural fusion.The obvious reason would be that it is natural for the sexes to co-operate.One has a profound, if irrational, instinct in favour of the theory that the union of man and woman makes for the greatest satisfaction, the most complete happiness.But the sight of the two people getting into the taxi and the satisfaction it gave me made me also ask whether there are two sexes in the mind corresponding to the two sexes in the body, and whether they also require to be united in order to get complete satisfaction and happiness? And I went on amateurishly to sketch a plan of the soul so that in each of us two powers preside, one male, one female; and in the man’s brain the man predominates over the woman, and in the woman’s brain the woman predominates over the man.The normal and comfortable state of being is that when the two live in harmony together, spiritually co-operating.If one is a man, still the woman part of his brain must have effect; and a woman also must have intercourse with the man in her.Coleridge perhaps meant this when he said that a great mind is androgynous.It is when this fusion takes place that the mind is fully fertilized and uses all its faculties.Perhaps a mind that is purely masculine cannot create, any more than a mind that is purely feminine, I thought.But it would be well to test what one meant by man-womanly, and conversely by woman-manly, by pausing and looking at a book or two."
"柯尔律治提到一个伟大的头脑兼有男女两性的时候，他的意思当然不是说这个头脑对女人有任何特别的同情，也不是说这个头脑从事女人的事业或者专门致力于对女人的阐释。兼有男女两性的大脑大概比单一性的大脑更不易于产生这些差别。他的意思可能就是说：兼有两性的大脑是会产生共鸣的，是有渗透性的；它传递情感时没有障碍；它生来就是富有创造力、极其清晰、完整一致的。事实上，人们会回到莎士比亚的大脑上，将其作为兼有男女两性的大脑的典型以及男人女性的典型，尽管不可能去讲莎士比亚对女人有什么想法。得到充分发展的大脑的一个标志就是它不会特意去想性别的问题，也不会把性别拿出来单独考虑，如果真是这样的话，那么现在要达到那种程度不知比以前要困难多少。现在我来到了一些在世作家的作品面前，并且停住了，想知道这个事实是否就是令我困惑了很久的某件事情的根源。没有一个时代像我们这个时代一样具有强烈的性别意识。大英博物馆里男人写的无数关于女人的书就是一个证据。无疑这要归咎于妇女选举权运动。那一定是在男人中间激起了一种想要独断专行的反常欲望，并且使得男人要强调自己的性别及其特征；要是没有受到挑战，他们是不会费神去想这些的。如果一个人从未受到过挑战，那么有人挑战他的时候，哪怕只是几个戴黑帽子的女人，他也会过分地进行报复。那也许解释了我记得是在这里发现的一些特点，我这样想着，拿下A先生的一部新小说。A先生正是风华正茂的时候，而且书评家们显然也觉得他不错。我翻开书。再一次读男人的作品确实很愉悦。看过女人的作品之后，就觉得男人的文章是如此直截了当。作品显示了思想的自由、人格的自主和内心的自信。这种得到很好的滋养、受到良好的教育、自由自在的思想从未受过阻挠，也从未有人反对，它自产生以来就享受完全的自由，可以随意伸展。一个人面对这种思想时，也感觉到了身体上的健康。所有这些都令人钦佩。但读过一两章后，一道阴影似乎横在书页内。那是一个直直的黑条，一个形似字母“I”的阴影。（注：英文中，字母“I”意为“我”。）人们开始左右闪躲，以便能瞥一眼后面的风景。我不太确定那到底是一棵树还是一个走路的女人。人们老是被招呼回去，去看字母“I”。他们开始厌烦字母“I”了。虽然这个“I”是一个非常值得尊敬的“I”，诚实又有逻辑头脑，硬如坚果，几百年的良好教育和良好饮食使它变得优雅。我由衷地尊重、羡慕那个“I”。可我翻了一两页，寻找某个东西，却发现最糟糕的是，在字母“I”的阴影里，一切都像雾一样没有形状。那是棵树么？不是，那是一个女人。可是看着菲比——那是她的名字——穿过海滩的时候，我觉得她身子里连一根骨头都没有。后来艾伦起床了，艾伦的影子马上就把菲比抹掉了。因为艾伦有见解，菲比就被他洪水般的见解消灭了。接下来，我又觉得艾伦有激情。我一页一页很快地翻过去，感觉关键的时刻就要到了，果然不出所料，事情就发生在阳光下的海滩边。写得非常直白。写得非常有力。没有比这个更下流的了。但是……我说了太多的“但是”。人不能老说“但是”。一个人总得想办法把句子说完，我谴责自己道。我要不要说完呢？“但是——我厌倦了！”可我为什么厌烦了呢？部分原因是字母“I”占据优势，而且枯燥乏味。就像一棵大山毛榉，字母“I”把这种枯燥乏味投在自己的阴影下。那儿什么都不能生长。还有一部分原因较为含糊。A先生脑中好像有某种阻碍，某种障碍物，它把创造力的源泉堵住了，把它送到窄小的范围里。想起牛津剑桥的午餐会、香烟灰、马恩岛猫、坦尼生和克里斯蒂娜·罗塞蒂——它们全聚在一起，那种障碍物似乎有可能就在那儿。菲比穿过海滩时，他不再低声哼哼“一颗美好的泪珠从门口那株西番莲花上滚落”，而艾伦走近时，她也不再回答说“我的心像一只歌唱的鸟，它的巢筑在一根被弄湿的嫩枝上”。那么，他能怎么办呢？诚实得像白昼，合理得像太阳，那么他能做的就只有一件事。平心而论，这件事他做了又做（我说道，一边翻着书），做了又做。我意识到这种忏悔的可怕性质，又补充道，这件事似乎多少有点乏味。莎士比亚的不雅根除了人们脑海中上千件别的事情，而且绝不乏味。可莎士比亚是写着玩的，而正如保姆们所说，A先生是故意这样写的。他这样做是为了表示抗议。他坚持自己的优越性，以此来反对女性的平等。他因此受到阻碍和约束，并且具有了自我意识。假使莎士比亚也认识克拉夫小姐和戴维斯小姐的话，可能也会这样。毫无疑问，如果妇女运动在十六世纪而不是在十九世纪开始的话，伊丽莎白时代的文学本会和实际情况有很大的差别。","Coleridge certainly did not mean, when he said that a great mind is androgynous, that it is a mind that has any special sympathy with women; a mind that takes up their cause or devotes itself to their interpretation.Perhaps the androgynous mind is less apt to make these distinctions than the single-sexed mind.He meant, perhaps, that the androgynous mind is resonant and porous; that it transmits emotion without impediment; that it is naturally creative, incandescent and undivided.In fact one goes back to Shakespeare’s mind as the type of the androgynous, of the man-womanly mind, though it would be impossible to say what Shakespeare thought of women.And if it be true that it is one of the tokens of the fully developed mind that it does not think specially or separately of sex, how much harder it is to attain that condition now than ever before.Here I came to the books by living writers, and there paused and wondered if this fact were not at the root of something that had long puzzled me. No age can ever have been as stridently sex-conscious as our own; those innumerable books by men about women in the British Museum are a proof of it. The Suffrage campaign was no doubt to blame.It must have roused in men an extraordinary desire for selfassertion; it must have made them lay an emphasis upon their own sex and its characteristics which they would not have troubled to think about had they not been challenged.And when one is challenged, even by a few women in black bonnets, one retaliates, if one has never been challenged before, rather excessively.That perhaps accounts for some of the characteristics that I remember to have found here, I thought, taking down a new novel by Mr A, who is in the prime of life and very well thought of, apparently, by the reviewers.I opened it.Indeed, it was delightful to read a man’s writing again.It was so direct, so straightforward after the writing of women.It indicated such freedom of mind, such liberty of person, such confidence in himself.One had a sense of physical well-being in the presence of this well-nourished, well-educated, free mind, which had never been thwarted or opposed, but had had full liberty from birth to stretch itself in whatever way it liked.All this was admirable.But after reading a chapter or two a shadow seemed to lie across the page.It was a straight dark bar, a shadow shaped something like the letter ‘I’.One began dodging this way and that to catch a glimpse of the landscape behind it.Whether that was indeed a tree or a woman walking I was not quite sure.Back one was always hailed to the letter ‘I’.One began to be tired of ‘I’.Not but what this ‘I’ was a most respectable ‘I’; honest and logical; as hard as a nut, and polished for centuries by good teaching and good feeding.I respect and admire that ‘I’ from the bottom of my heart.But—here I turned a page or two, looking for something or other the worst of it is that in the shadow of the letter ‘I’ all is shapeless as mist.Is that a tree?No, it is a woman.But... she has not a bone in her body, I thought, watching Phoebe, for that was her name, coming across the beach.Then Alan got up and the shadow of Alan at once obliterated Phoebe.For Alan had views and Phoebe was quenched in the flood of his views.And then Alan, I thought, has passions; and here I turned page after page very fast, feeling that the crisis was approaching, and so it was.It took place on the beach under the sun.It was done very openly.It was done very vigorously.Nothing could have been more indecent.But... I had said ‘but’ too often.One cannot go on saying ‘but’.One must finish the sentence somehow, I rebuked myself.Shall I finish it, ‘But—I am bored!’ But why was I bored?Partly because of the dominance of the letter ‘I’ and the aridity, which, like the giant beech tree, it casts within its shade.Nothing will grow there.And partly for some more obscure reason.There seemed to be some obstacle, some impediment in Mr A’s mind which blocked the fountain of creative energy and shored it within narrow limits.And remembering the lunch party at Oxbridge, and the cigarette ash and the Manx cat and Tennyson and Christina Rossetti all in a bunch, it seemed possible that the impediment lay there.As he no longer hums under his breath, ‘There has fallen a splendid tear from the passion-flower at the gate’, when Phoebe crosses the beach, and she no longer replies, ‘My heart is like a singing bird whose nest is in a water’d shoot’, when Alan approaches what can he do?Being honest as the day and logical as the sun, there is only one thing he can do.And that he does, to do him justice, over and over (I said turning the pages) and over again.And that, I added, aware of the awful nature of the confession, seems somehow dull.Shakespeare’s indecency uproots a thousand other things in one’s mind, and is far from being dull.But Shakespeare does it for pleasure; Mr A, as the nurses say, does it on purpose.He does it in protest.He is protesting against the equality of the other sex by asserting his own superiority.He is therefore impeded and inhibited and self-conscious as Shakespeare might have been if he too had known Miss Clough and Miss Davies.Doubtless Elizabethan literature would have been very different from what it is if the women’s movement had begun in the sixteenth century and not in the nineteenth."
"假如脑子具有两面性的理论行得通，那就等于说，男子气概现在就变成了男人的自我意识，也就是说，现在男人只是用他们脑子的男性面去写作。对于女人来说，读这些书真是错误，因为她必然会去寻找那些她怎么也找不到的东西。我认为，人们漏掉最多的就是暗示的力量。我拿起批评家B先生有关诗歌艺术的评论，仔细而忠实地去品读。这些评论非常出色，敏锐而博学；可问题在于，他不再传达感情。他的脑子似乎分隔成不同的房间，互相之间也不通音讯。因此，如果脑子里记一句B先生的句子，这句子会扑通一声掉在地上——死了。但若记一句柯尔律治的句子，这个句子会在头脑里爆炸，并激发出各种各样的其他想法，这才是人们所说的唯一一种具有永生奥秘的文笔。","What, then, it amounts to, if this theory of the two sides of the mind holds good, is that virility has now become self-conscious-men, that is to say, are now writing only with the male side of their brains.It is a mistake for a woman to read them, for she will inevitably look for something that she will not find.It is the power of suggestion that one most misses, I thought, taking Mr B the critic in my hand and reading, very carefully and very dutifully, his remarks upon the art of poetry.Very able they were, acute and full of learning; but the trouble was that his feelings no longer communicated; his mind seemed separated into different chambers; not a sound carried from one to the other.Thus, when one takes a sentence of Mr B into the mind it falls plump to the ground—dead; but when one takes a sentence of Coleridge into the mind, it explodes and gives birth to all kinds of other ideas, and that is the only sort of writing of which one can say that it has the secret of perpetual life."
"但不论理由可能是什么，那都是令人们深感遗憾的事实。因为这意味着——现在我走到了一排排摆着高尔斯华绥先生和吉卜林先生的书架前——我们最伟大的在世作家的一些最出色的作品却被人忽视。无论怎么做，女人在那些作品里面也不会找到批评家保证一定有的那种永生泉源。不仅是因为他们赞扬男性的美德、巩固男性的价值并且描述男人的世界，还因为，渗透在这些书中的情感是一个女人所无法领悟的。情感来临了，在聚集，就要在人的头上迸发出来，这种情感早早地就开始铺垫。一张画会落到老乔利恩头上；他会因此受惊而死；老牧师在他旁边念几句悼文；泰晤士河上所有的天鹅会同时唱起来。不过，还没等这种情感开始描述，女性读者就匆匆走开躲到醋栗丛中了。因为这种对男人来讲如此深刻、如此细腻、如此具有象征意义的感情，却令女人觉得不可思议。吉卜林先生笔下的那些转过身去的军官就是如此，还有他笔下的那些播下种子的播种人、他那些单独工作的人们，还有那面旗子——女人见到那些大写字体都会脸红，就像在窃听那些纯粹的男人的狂欢作乐时被抓个正着一样。原因在于，不论是高尔斯华绥先生，还是吉卜林先生，他们的脑海里没有一点点的女性思维。这样一来，可以这样概括，他们的所有特质在女人眼里似乎是天真而不成熟的。他们缺少暗示性的力量。一本书要是缺少暗示性的力量，那么不管它打在脑袋上有多重，还是不能渗透到大脑里面。","But whatever the reason may be, it is a fact that one must deplore.For it means—here I had come to rows of books by Mr Galsworthy and Mr Kipling—that some of the finest works of our greatest living writers fall upon deaf ears.Do what she will a woman cannot find in them that fountain of perpetual life which the critics assure her is there.It is not only that they celebrate male virtues, enforce male values and describe the world of men; it is that the emotion with which these books are permeated is to a woman incomprehensible.It is coming, it is gathering, it is about to burst on one’s head, one begins saying long before the end. That picture will fall on old Jolyon’s head; he will die of the shock; the old clerk will speak over him two or three obituary words; and all the swans on the Thames will simutaneously burst out singing.But one will rush away before that happens and hide in the gooseberry bushes, for the emotion which is so deep, so subtle, so symbolical to a man moves a woman to wonder.So with Mr Kipling’s officers who turn their Backs; and his Sowers who sow the Seed; and his Men who are alone with their Work; and the Flag—one blushes at all these capital letters as if one had been caught eavesdropping at some purely masculine orgy.The fact is that neither Mr Galsworthy nor Mr Kipling has a spark of the woman in him.Thus all their qualities seem to a woman, if one may generalize, crude and immature.They lack suggestive power.And when a book lacks suggestive power, however hard it hits the surface of the mind it cannot penetrate within."
"我把书拿出来，看也不看便放回去，就是在这种焦躁不安的心境中，我开始想象一个纯粹的、以独断的男性气概为特征的未来时代，正如教授们的通信（譬如沃尔特·罗利爵士的信件）似乎预言过的那个时代一样，而意大利的统治者们则早在意大利使之成为了现实。在罗马，没有人不对这种十足的男性特征印象深刻，而且无论这种男性特征对于国家有怎样的价值，人们都可以质疑这种特征对诗歌艺术的影响。不管怎样，从报纸上看来，人们对意大利的小说有些忧心忡忡。学者们举行了一次会议，旨在“发展意大利小说”。几天前，“许多出生名门的人，或是来自金融届、实业届、法西斯党团体的人”，他们聚在一起，讨论这件事，还打个电报给元首，表示了他们的愿望，即“法西斯时代很快就会产生一位配得上这个时代的诗人”。我们也许都有这个虔诚的愿望，但是大家很怀疑诗歌能不能用孵卵器生产出来。诗歌应该有个母亲，也应该有个父亲。法西斯的诗歌恐怕是一个可怕的畸形儿，就像某些乡镇博物馆里放在玻璃瓶里的那样。据说这种怪物绝对活不长，从来没见过有这种怪物在田里割草。一个身体长两个头并不会让人长寿。","And in that restless mood in which one takes books out and puts them back again without looking at them I began to envisage an age to come of pure, of self-assertive virility, such as the letters of professors (take Sir Walter Raleigh’s letters, for instance) seem to forebode, and the rulers of Italy have already brought into being. For one can hardly fail to be impressed in Rome by the sense of unmitigated masculinity; and whatever the value of unmitigated masculinity upon the state, one may question the effect of it upon the art of poetry.At any rate, according to the newspapers, there is a certain anxiety about fiction in Italy.There has been a meeting of academicians whose object it is ‘to develop the Italian novel’.‘Men famous by birth, or in finance, industry or the Fascist corporations’ came together the other day and discussed the matter, and a telegram was sent to the Duce expressing the hope ‘that the Fascist era would soon give birth to a poet worthy of it’. We may all join in that pious hope, but it is doubtful whether poetry can come of an incubator.Poetry ought to have a mother as well as a father.The Fascist poem, one may fear, will be a horrid little abortion such as one sees in a glass jar in the museum of some county town.Such monsters never live long, it is said; one has never seen a prodigy of that sort cropping grass in a field.Two heads on one body do not make for length of life."
"然而，要怪罪的话，既不该怪男性，也不该怪女性。所有的骗子和改革家都有责任：对格兰维尔勋爵撒谎的贝斯伯勒夫人要负责任；对格雷格先生说真话的戴维斯小姐也要负责任。所有引起性别意识的人都有罪责。在戴维斯小姐和克拉夫小姐出世前，作家是平等地使用大脑的两个面的。当我想在书上施展才能的时候，正是这些人，驱使我在这幸福的时刻去寻找性意识。这样一来，我们不得不又回到莎士比亚，因为莎士比亚是兼顾两性的，还有济慈、斯特恩、柯珀、兰姆、柯尔律治都是。雪莱大概是中性的。弥尔顿和本·琼森则显现了太多的男性特征。华兹华斯和托尔斯泰也是如此。如果不算女性特征多一点的话，那么我们时代的普鲁斯特可是完全兼有两性的。不过那个缺点太少见了，不值得人们抱怨，因为如果没有那样的某种混合的话，智力似乎就占据了优势，而脑子其他的官能就变得麻木，贫乏，没有创造力。然而，让我聊以自慰的是，我觉得这也许是一个转瞬即逝的过程。我曾答应告诉你们我的思想历程，也遵照我的许诺讲了不少话，现在看来有不少似乎已经过时了；许多我眼中的闪光点，对于还没到成熟年岁的你们来说，似乎难以捉摸。","However, the blame for all this, if one is anxious to lay blame, rests no more upon one sex than upon the other.All seducers and reformers are responsible: Lady Bessborough when she lied to Lord Granville; Miss Davies when she told the truth to Mr Greg.All who have brought about a state of sex-consciousness are to blame, and it is they who drive me, when I want to stretch my faculties on a book, to seek it in that happy age, before Miss Davies and Miss Clough were born, when the writer used both sides of his mind equally.One must turn back to Shakespeare then, for Shakespeare was androgynous; and so were Keats and Sterne and Cowper and Lamb and Coleridge.Shelley perhaps was sexless.Milton and Ben Jonson had a dash too much of the male in them.So had Wordsworth and Tolstoi.In our time Proust was wholly androgynous, if not perhaps a little too much of a woman.But that failing is too rare for one to complain of it, since without some mixture of the kind the intellect seems to predominate and the other faculties of the mind harden and become barren.However, I consoled myself with the reflection that this is perhaps a passing phase; much of what I have said in obedience to my promise to give you the course of my thoughts will seem out of date; much of what flames in my eyes will seem dubious to you who have not yet come of age."
"即便如此，我走到书桌旁，拿起那张写着《妇女和小说》的纸，说道，我要写的第一句话就是：任何人在写作的时候，若考虑到自己的性别，都是致命的。若是一个纯粹的男人或女人，也是没救的。一个作家必须是具有男子气的女性或者具有女子气的男性。一个女人哪怕是发一点委屈牢骚，祈求一点公平待遇，总之只要是有意识地以女人的身份在说话，那都是致命的。我说的致命，并不是打比方，因为基于这种性别偏见写出的任何东西都注定死亡。这种作品也不会有所发展。这种作品在一两天内，可能显得才华横溢，引人注目，娴熟有力，可到夜幕降临，那就必定凋谢消亡，不会在读者的心里生长。要想完成艺术创作，大脑里必须同时拥有男性和女性的意识。这种男女意识必须合作到底。如果我们要了解到作家正在完全充分地传达他的感受，我们的整个心灵就必须完全敞开。还要有一种自由平和的心境。不能让一个车轮发出声响，不能让一盏灯发出微光。窗帘一定要拉严。我想，作者一旦叙述完他的经历，必定会躺下来，让他的头脑在黑暗中庆祝男女意识合作成功。他不会查看或者质疑正在发生什么。相反，他会去摘取玫瑰花的花瓣，或者看着天鹅静静地顺着河水而游走。而我又看到河水载走了那条船、那个大学生和那些枯叶；还有那辆出租车载着男人和女人，我觉得又看到他们一起穿过街道，也被冲到川流不息的河里去了；我一边想着，一边听着远处传来伦敦的行人车辆的轰鸣声，也卷入了奔流的河水中。","Even so, the very first sentence that I would write here, I said, crossing over to the writing-table and taking up the page headed Women and Fiction, is that it is fatal for anyone who writes to think of their sex. It is fatal to be a man or woman pure and simple; one must be woman-manly or man-womanly.It is fatal for a woman to lay the least stress on any grievance; to plead even with justice any cause; in any way to speak consciously as a woman.And fatal is no figure of speech; for anything written with that conscious bias is doomed to death.It ceases to be fertilized.Brilliant and effective, powerful and masterly, as it may appear for a day or two, it must wither at nightfall; it cannot grow in the minds of others.Some collaboration has to take place in the mind between the woman and the man before the art of creation can be accomplished.Some marriage of opposites has to be consummated.The whole of the mind must lie wide open if we are to get the sense that the writer is communicating his experience with perfect fullness.There must be freedom and there must be peace.Not a wheel must grate, not a light glimmer.The curtains must be close drawn.The writer, I thought, once his experience is over, must lie back and let his mind celebrate its nuptials in darkness.He must not look or question what is being done.Rather, he must pluck the petals from a rose or watch the swans float calmly down the river.And I saw again the current which took the boat and the under-graduate and the dead leaves; and the taxi took the man and the woman, I thought, seeing them come together across the street, and the current swept them away, I thought, hearing far off the roar of London's traffic, into that tremendous stream."
"现在玛丽·贝顿不再说话了。她已经告诉你她是如何得出这个结论的——这个平庸乏味的结论：如果你要写小说或诗歌，那么需要一年有五百英镑的收入，还要一间门上有锁的屋子。她已经尽力把种种想法和印象都说出来了，正是这些想法和印象导致她这样思考。她请你随她跑到教区执事的怀里，在这儿吃午饭，在那儿用晚餐，去大英博物馆画画，从书架上取下书，往窗外张望。她在做所有这些事情的时候，你一定会观察她的缺点和弱点，并判断这些缺点和弱点对她的想法有什么影响。你也一直在反驳她，在补充或者缩减，只要是看上去对自己有利的。本来就该这样，因为在这个问题上，只有把多种错误放在一起才能得到真理。我现在要亲自预言两种评论，以此作为结束。这两种评论非常明显，你也能想得出来。","Here, then, Mary Beton ceases to speak.She has told you how she reached the conclusion—the prosaic conclusion—that it is necessary to have five hundred a year and a room with a lock on the door if you are to write fiction or poetry.She has tried to lay bare the thoughts and impressions that led her to think this.She has asked you to follow her flying into the arms of a Beadle, lunching here, dining there, drawing pictures in the British Museum, taking books from the shelf, looking out of the window.While she has been doing all these things, you no doubt have been observing her failings and foibles and deciding what effect they have had on her opinions.You have been contradicting her and making whatever additions and deductions seem good to you.That is all as it should be, for in a question like this truth is only to be had by laying together many varieties of error.And I will end now in my own person by anticipating two criticisms, so obvious that you can hardly fail to make them."
"你也许会说，哪怕是作家，对于两性的相对优点，也并未表达过什么见解。那是故意的，因为即使到了衡量男女两性优缺点的时候——此刻知道女人有多少钱和多少间房比空谈关于女性才干的理论更重要，即使到了那样的时候，我也不相信天赋——不管是思想上还是性格上的——能像糖和黄油那样称量，即使在剑桥大学也不能，哪怕在剑桥他们善于把人分门别类，把帽子戴在他们头上，并在名字后头标些字母。我认为，即使在《惠特克年鉴》里找到的尊卑序列表也不能代表价值的最终顺序，也没有任何充分的理由可以认为，赴宴的时候，巴思的一位高级爵士最后会走在精神病专家的后面。所有这种性别与性别、特质与特质之间的争斗，所有这种自命不凡、认为他人低劣的行径，都是人类存在过程中的私立学校阶段——存在着“派系”，这一派必须攻击另一派，最重要的事就是走上讲台、从校长手里接过那极为华丽的奖杯。但随着人变得成熟，他们就不再相信派系、校长或是极为华丽的奖杯。不管怎样，众所周知，谈到书籍的话，想要在书上贴上优点的标签而不让它们掉下来是相当困难的。难道当前文学的书评不是一个永久例证吗，证明了评判的难度？“这是本伟大的书”，“这是本无用的书”，同一本书就有两种评价。赞扬和指责都同样没有意义。是的，把估量别人的作品当成一种消遣可能令人愉悦，但却是所有职业中最无意义的工作；屈从于这些评论者的裁定，就是最奴颜婢膝的姿态。只要写你自己想写的东西就行了，别的都不重要；至于是否能世代流传还是只能存在片刻，谁也不知道。不过，为了尊重某位手拿银杯的校长或是某位拿着标尺的教授，而牺牲你一根头发般的想象力，牺牲其少许色彩，那都是最可悲的变节。相形之下，财富或贞洁的牺牲——曾被说成是人类最大灾难，只不过像是被跳蚤叮了一口而已。","No opinion has been expressed, you may say, upon the comparative merits of the sexes even as writers.That was done purposely, because, even if the time had come for such a valuation—and it is far more important at the moment to know how much money women had and how many rooms than to theorize about their capacities—even if the time had come I do not believe that gifts, whether of mind or character, can be weighed like sugar and butter, not even in Cambridge, where they are so adept at putting people into classes and fixing caps on their heads and letters after their names.I do not believe that even the Table of Precedency which you will find in Whitaker’s ALMANAC represents a final order of values, or that there is any sound reason to suppose that a Commander of the Bath will ultimately walk in to dinner behind a Master in Lunacy.All this pitting of sex against sex, of quality against quality; all this claiming of superiority and imputing of inferiority belong to the private-school stage of human existence where there are ‘sides’, and it is necessary for one side to beat another side, and of the utmost importance to walk up to a platform and receive from the hands of the Headmaster himself a highly ornamental pot.As people mature they cease to believe in sides or in Headmasters or in highly ornamental pots.At any rate, where books are concerned, it is notoriously difficult to fix labels of merit in such a way that they do not come off. Are not reviews of current literature a perpetual illustration of the difficulty of judgement?‘This great book’, ‘this worthless book’, the same book is called by both names.Praise and blame alike mean nothing.No, delightful as the pastime of measuring may be, it is the most futile of all occupations, and to submit to the decrees of the measurers the most servile of attitudes.So long as you write what you wish to write, that is all that matters; and whether it matters for ages or only for hours, nobody can say.But to sacrifice a hair of the head of your vision, a shade of its colour, in deference to some Headmaster with a silver pot in his hand or to some professor with a measuring-rod up his sleeve, is the most abject treachery, and the sacrifice of wealth and chastity which used to be said to be the greatest of human disasters, a mere flea-bite in comparison. "
"下面，我想你们可能会提出异议，认为我说的所有这些都太注重物质了。即便为象征主义留出充足的余地，让一年五百镑代表可以沉思的力量，而门上的锁意味着独自思考的力量，你仍然可以说，思想是高于这些的，而且大诗人一般都很穷困潦倒。那么就让我给你们引用一下你们文学教授的话，他比我更清楚什么能够造就诗人。阿瑟·奎勒—库奇爵士写道：[11]","Next I think that you may object that in all this I have made too much of the importance of material things.Even allowing a generous margin for symbolism, that five hundred a year stands for the power to contemplate, that a lock on the door means the power to think for oneself, still you may say that the mind should rise above such things; and that great poets have often been poor men.Let me then quote to you the words of your own Professor of Literature, who knows better than I do what goes to the making of a poet.Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch writes:[11]"
"“过去这几百年来，伟大诗人的名字都有哪些？柯尔律治，华兹华斯，拜伦，雪莱，兰多，济慈，丁尼生，勃朗宁，阿诺德，莫里斯，罗塞蒂，斯温伯恩——我们先说到这里。所有这些人中，除了济慈，布朗宁，罗塞蒂，其余都是大学生；而这三人中，年纪轻轻、正当盛年便去世的济慈是唯一一个家境不算优越的。这样说来似乎很残忍，也有些悲哀。可是，有人说，天才诗人不论身处何地，不论贫富，都能得到发展，这个理论就基本站不住脚，这可是铁一般的事实。事实上，这十二位中的九位是大学生，也就是说他们或多或少都能够受到过英国提供的最佳教育。事实上，余下的三位中，你也知道，勃朗宁家境殷实，我敢断言，倘若他家境不好，他就无法写出《扫罗》、《指环与书》，这就与如果罗斯金的父亲如果生意不兴隆，罗金斯也没法写成《现代画家》是一个道理。罗塞蒂有笔小小的个人收入，除此之外，他还卖画。那现在只剩下济慈了，命运女神阿特洛波斯带走了这个年轻人，就如在疯人院里带走了约翰·克莱尔，又带走了用鸦片酊麻醉失望的詹姆斯·汤姆逊。这些都是可怕的事实，可我们还是要面对。对于作为一个民族的我们来说，不管这是多么大的耻辱，可以肯定的是，由于我们国家的某些过失，今天穷诗人连最起码的机会都没有，过去两百年来都是如此。相信我——我用了十年的大部分时间观察了320多所小学，我们可能在胡扯些民主，其实，英国的穷孩子同雅典奴隶的孩子一样，几乎没有机会得到解放，获得智力上的自由，而正是这种自由，才能产生伟大的作品。”","‘What are the great poetical names of the last hundred years or so?Coleridge, Wordsworth, Byron, Shelley, Landor, Keats, Tennyson, Browning, Arnold, Morris, Rossetti, Swinburne—we may stop there.Of these, all but Keats, Browning, Rossetti were University men, and of these three, Keats, who died young, cut off in his prime, was the only one not fairly well to do.It may seem a brutal thing to say, and it is a sad thing to say: but, as a matter of hard fact, the theory that poetical genius bloweth where it listeth, and equally in poor and rich, holds little truth.As a matter of hard fact, nine out of those twelve were University men: which means that somehow or other they procured the means to get the best education England can give.As a matter of hard fact, of the remaining three you know that Browning was well to do, and I challenge you that, if he had not been well to do, he would no more have attained to write SAUL or THE RING AND THE BOOK than Ruskin would have attained to writing MODERN PAINTERS if his father had not dealt prosperously in business.Rossetti had a small private income; and, moreover, he painted.There remains but Keats; whom Atropos slew young, as she slew John Clare in a mad-house, and James Thomson by the laudanum he took to drug disappointment.These are dreadful facts, but let us face them.It is—however dishonouring to us as a nation—certain that, by some fault in our commonwealth, the poor poet has not in these days, nor has had for two hundred years, a dog’s chance.Believe me—and I have spent a great part of ten years in watching some three hundred and twenty elementary schools, we may prate of democracy, but actually, a poor child in England has little more hope than had the son of an Athenian slave to be emancipated into that intellectual freedom of which great writings are born.’"
"没人能把这一点说得更清楚了。“今天穷诗人连最起码的机会都没有，过去两百年都是如此……英国的穷孩子同雅典奴隶的孩子一样，几乎没有机会得到解放，获得智力上的自由，而正是这种自由，才能产生伟大的作品。”的确如此。智力上的自由依赖于物质环境。而诗歌创作依赖于智力上的自由。而女人历来就很贫穷，不只是近二百年，是有史以来就如此。女人在智力上的自由比雅典奴隶的孩子们还少。所以，女人连创作诗歌的最起码的机会都没有。这就是为什么我那么重视金钱和一个自己的房间。然而，多亏了过去那些不为人知的女性的辛苦劳作——我希望对其多了解一些，说来也怪，也多亏了那两场奇怪的战争，一场是克里米亚战争，把弗洛伦斯·南丁格尔带出客厅，另一场是欧洲战争，它在约六十年后替普通妇女打开大门，正是由于这些，那些弊端才逐步得到改进。要不然你们今晚就不会在这儿了，一年赚五百英镑的机会——虽然现在恐怕仍是不确定的——也会小到极点。","Nobody could put the point more plainly.‘The poor poet has not in these days, nor has had for two hundred years, a dog’s chance... a poor child in England has little more hope than had the son of an Athenian slave to be emancipated into that intellectual freedom of which great writings are born.’ That is it.Intellectual freedom depends upon material things.Poetry depends upon intellectual freedom.And women have always been poor, not for two hundred years merely, but from the beginning of time.Women have had less intellectual freedom than the sons of Athenian slaves.Women, then, have not had a dog’s chance of writing poetry.That is why I have laid so much stress on money and a room of one’s own. However, thanks to the toils of those obscure women in the past, of whom I wish we knew more, thanks, curiously enough to two wars, the Crimean which let Florence Nightingale out of her drawing-room, and the European War which opened the doors to the average woman some sixty years later, these evils are in the way to be bettered.Otherwise you would not be here tonight, and your chance of earning five hundred pounds a year, precarious as I am afraid that it still is, would be minute in the extreme."
"大概你们还会提出异议，你为什么认为女人写书那么重要？照你所说，那需要下很大的工夫，可能会使姑母丧命，几乎无疑会很晚才吃午饭，还可能与某些非常好的人发生严重的争执。我承认，某种程度上，我的动机是自私的。就如大部分没受过教育的英国女人一样，我喜欢读书——什么书我都喜欢看。近来，我的口味变得单调乏味。历史书里大都记载战争，传记都是描述大人物，感觉诗歌也开始显现出空洞贫乏的迹象，至于小说，我可是充分暴露了自己作为近现代小说批评家的无能，所以就不多说了。因此我愿请你们写各种各样的书，不管是多么琐碎还是多么宏大的主题，都不必犹豫。不管什么办法，我希望你们会拥有足够的钱，用于旅行闲游，思考这个世界的过去与未来，去看书、梦想，在街头巷角闲逛，让思想的钓线深深垂到河里去。因为我绝不会把你们限制在小说里的。如果你们愿意让我高兴——还有成千上万和我一样的人——你就可以写些游记和历险记、研究著作和学术专著、史书和传记、评论、哲学以及科学书籍。写这些书的同时，你们写小说的手法肯定也会提高。因为各种题材的书之间也会相互影响。小说要是和诗歌、哲学并肩携手就会好很多。除此之外，如果想想过去的大人物，如萨福，紫式部夫人，埃米莉·勃朗特，你会发现她们既是继承者，又是创始人，而且她们之所以能够存在，是因为女性最终自然地形成了写作的习惯。所以，即使是写一篇序诗，这样的写作也会让你受益匪浅。","Still, you may object, why do you attach so much importance to this writing of books by women when, according to you, it requires so much effort, leads perhaps to the murder of one’s aunts, will make one almost certainly late for luncheon, and may bring one into very grave disputes with certain very good fellows?My motives, let me admit, are partly selfish.Like most uneducated Englishwomen, I like reading—I like reading books in the bulk.Lately my diet has become a trifle monotonous; history is too much about wars; biography too much about great men; poetry has shown, I think, a tendency to sterility, and fiction but I have sufficiently exposed my disabilities as a critic of modern fiction and will say no more about it.Therefore I would ask you to write all kinds of books, hesitating at no subject however trivial or however vast.By hook or by crook, I hope that you will possess yourselves of money enough to travel and to idle, to contemplate the future or the past of the world, to dream over books and loiter at street corners and let the line of thought dip deep into the stream.For I am by no means confining you to fiction.If you would please me—and there are thousands like me—you would write books of travel and adventure, and research and scholarship, and history and biography, and criticism and philosophy and science.By so doing you will certainly profit the art of fiction.For books have a way of influencing each other.Fiction will be much the better for standing cheek by jowl with poetry and philosophy.Moreover, if you consider any great figure of the past, like Sappho, like the Lady Murasaki, like Emily Bronte, you will find that she is an inheritor as well as an originator, and has come into existence because women have come to have the habit of writing naturally; so that even as a prelude to poetry such activity on your part would be invaluable."
"但每当我回头看这些笔记，并且评价我在做这些笔记时的思路时，我发现我的动机并非全是自私的。在这些评论和漫谈中，始终有一种信念——或者说是本性？——好书是值得拥有的，而好的作家，即使表现出了每种人格的堕落，也仍为善人。所以，当我让你们写出更多的书的时候，我是在催促你们去做有利于自己和整个世界的事情。我不知道如何为这种本性或是信念辩护，因为没上过大学的人，很容易弄错哲学名词。“现实”是什么意思呢？它好像是很无常的一些东西，很不可靠——一会儿在尘土飞扬的马路上，一会儿在街上的一小块报纸上，一会儿又是阳光下的一株水仙花。它能让屋里的一群人都欢快起来，让某句无心之语被人牢记。它让星空下走路回家的人不知所措，使无声世界比有声世界更真实——然后它又出现在喧闹的皮卡迪利大街上的公交车里。有时它似乎又居住在离我们太远的形体里，让我们无法识别其本性。但无论它碰到了什么，它就定下来，并长久不变。那是白昼的外表被丢进树篱以后剩下的东西，也是时光和爱恨都流逝后留下的东西。我认为，现在作家比别人更有在这种现实面前生活的机会。作家的职责就是把这个现实找到、搜集起来，并传达给我们其他人。至少这是我在读《李尔王》、《爱玛》和《追忆似水年华》时推断出来的。因为阅读这些书就好像是在感官上做了一个奇特的白内障手术，人在手术后看得更深刻了，世界的遮盖物似乎被揭掉了，被赋予了更强的生命力。和虚幻作对的人是令人羡慕的，而被那些无意中、不经意做出的事情当头击中的人是可怜的。所以当我要你们去赚钱，拥有自己的房间的时候，我是要你们生活在现实面前，一种充满生气的生活自会到来，不管人们能否将这种生活传达出来。","But when I look back through these notes and criticize my own train of thought as I made them, I find that my motives were not altogether selfish.There runs through these comments and discursions the conviction—or is it the instinct?—that good books are desirable and that good writers, even if they show every variety of human depravity, are still good human beings.Thus when I ask you to write more books I am urging you to do what will be for your good and for the good of the world at large.How to justify this instinct or belief I do not know, for philosophic words, if one has not been educated at a university, are apt to play one false.What is meant by ‘reality’?It would seem to be something very erratic, very undependable—now to be found in a dusty road, now in a scrap of newspaper in the street, now a daffodil in the sun.It lights up a group in a room and stamps some casual saying.It overwhelms one walking home beneath the stars and makes the silent world more real than the world of speech—and then there it is again in an omnibus in the uproar of Piccadilly.Sometimes, too, it seems to dwell in shapes too far away for us to discern what their nature is.But whatever it touches, it fixes and makes permanent.That is what remains over when the skin of the day has been cast into the hedge; that is what is left of past time and of our loves and hates.Now the writer, as I think, has the chance to live more than other people in the presence of this reality.It is his business to find it and collect it and communicate it to the rest of us.So at least I infer from reading LEAR or EMMA or LA RECHERCHE DU TEMPS PERDU.For the reading of these books seems to perform a curious couching operation on the senses; one sees more intensely afterwards; the world seems bared of its covering and given an intenser life.Those are the enviable people who live at enmity with unreality; and those are the pitiable who are knocked on the head by the thing done without knowing or caring.So that when I ask you to earn money and have a room of your own, I am asking you to live in the presence of reality, an invigorating life, it would appear, whether one can impart it or not."
"我想就此停住，不过迫于惯例的压力，每场演讲都应该以结论告终。而且你们也会赞成，一个面向女士的演讲结语应该有一些特别令人激动，令人尊敬的东西。我想请你们记得你们的责任，要更高雅，更注重精神世界；我也提醒你们，有无数事情依赖你们，你们对未来会有巨大影响。不过我想这些勉励的话语留给男人应该不错，他们一定会比我讲得流利得多，其实他们已经这样做了。当我在脑海里搜索的时候，并没有发现关于成为伙伴、人人平等以及为了更高的目标影响世界这样的高尚情感。我发现自己在简洁地、平淡无奇地说着话，意思就是，做自己比其他任何事情都重要。如果我知道怎么把话说得激动人心，我会说，不要想着去影响别人。要想事物本身。","Here I would stop, but the pressure of convention decrees that every speech must end with a peroration.And a peroration addressed to women should have something, you will agree, particularly exalting and ennobling about it.I should implore you to remember your responsibilities, to be higher, more spiritual; I should remind you how much depends upon you, and what an influence you can exert upon the future.But those exhortations can safely, I think, be left to the other sex, who will put them, and indeed have put them, with far greater eloquence than I can compass.When I rummage in my own mind I find no noble sentiments about being companions and equals and influencing the world to higher ends.I find myself saying briefly and prosaically that it is much more important to be oneself than anything else.Do not dream of influencing other people, I would say, if I knew how to make it sound exalted.Think of things in themselves."
"当我翻阅报纸，阅读小说和人物传记的时候，我又想起，一个女人和另一个女人谈话的时候，总会有些不中听的话。女人对女人是不客气的。女人也不喜欢女人。女人——难道你们对这两个字还没烦死么？我向你们保证，我已经烦死了。让我们就此达成共识，即一个女人对许多女人读一篇论文的时候，当然会用一些非常令人不快的话结尾。","And again I am reminded by dipping into newspapers and novels and biographies that when a woman speaks to women she should have something very unpleasant up her sleeve.Women are hard on women.Women dislike women.Women—but are you not sick to death of the word?I can assure you that I am.Let us agree, then, that a paper read by a woman to women should end with something particularly disagreeable."
"可是怎么说呢？我能想出来什么呢？说实话，我是时常喜欢女人的。喜欢她们的不落俗套。喜欢她们的完整无缺。喜欢她们的默默无闻。我喜欢——我可不能这样一直说下去。那边的壁橱——你说里面只是些干净的餐巾，可要是阿奇博尔德·博德金爵士躲在餐巾里怎么办？那么还是让我严肃点吧。在前文中，人类的警告和责难我有没有给你们讲清楚？我已经讲过，奥斯卡·勃朗宁先生对你们的评价甚低。我已经指出，曾经的拿破仑是怎么看你们的，还有墨索里尼现在对你们的看法。那么，说不定你们当中有人要致力于小说创作，为了你们好，我已经抄写了那位评论家的建议，他所说的就是要勇于承认女性的性别局限性。我也提到过X教授，还专门介绍了他的说法，即女人在智力、道德和体力上都逊男人一筹。我已经传达了那些没有找就得来的看法，这是最后的警告——是约翰·兰登·戴维斯先生说的。[12]约翰·兰登·戴维斯先生警告女人,“等到人们不想要孩子的时候，女人的存在也就完全没有必要了”。我希望你们会记住这句话。","But how does it go?What can I think of?The truth is, I often like women.I like their unconventionality.I like their completeness.I like their anonymity.I like—but I must not run on in this way.That cupboard there—you say it holds clean table-napkins only; but what if Sir Archibald Bodkin were concealed among them?Let me then adopt a sterner tone.Have I, in the preceding words, conveyed to you sufficiently the warnings and reprobation of mankind?I have told you the very low opinion in which you were held by Mr Oscar Browning.I have indicated what Napoleon once thought of you and what Mussolini thinks now.Then, in case any of you aspire to fiction, I have copied out for your benefit the advice of the critic about courageously acknowledging the limitations of your sex.I have referred to Professor X and given prominence to his statement that women are intellectually, morally and physically inferior to men.I have handed on all that has come my way without going in search of it, and here is a final warning—from Mr John Langdon Davies.[12]Mr John Langdon Davies warns women ‘that when children cease to be altogether desirable, women cease to be altogether necessary’.I hope you will make a note of it."
"我怎样才能进一步鼓励你们着手去经营自己的人生呢？年轻的女士们，请注意，我要从现在开始做结论，在我看来，你们愚昧得可耻。你们未曾有过任何重要发现。你们未曾威慑帝国，也未曾领军打仗。你们未曾写出莎士比亚那样的戏剧，也未曾用文明教化野蛮的民族。你们怎样为自己开脱呢？世界上云集着忙于交通、生意和求爱的黑人、白人和棕色人种，你们固然可以指着那里的街道、广场和树林，然后说，我们手头还有其他工作。倘若没有我们的工作，那么海上就无船航行，沃土就变成沙漠。女性生育了16.23亿人，还要养育他们、给他们洗澡、教育他们，可能一直到他们长到六七岁的时候——根据统计，这是现在在世的人数——就算有人帮忙，生养、教育这么多人也是需要时间的。","How can I further encourage you to go about the business of life?Young women, I would say, and please attend, for the peroration is beginning, you are, in my opinion, disgracefully ignorant.You have never made a discovery of any sort of importance.You have never shaken an empire or led an army into battle.The plays of Shakespeare are not by you, and you have never introduced a barbarous race to the blessings of civilization.What is your excuse?It is all very well for you to say, pointing to the streets and squares and forests of the globe swarming with black and white and coffee-coloured inhabitants, all busily engaged in traffic and enterprise and love-making, we have had other work on our hands.Without our doing, those seas would be unsailed and those fertile lands a desert.We have borne and bred and washed and taught, perhaps to the age of six or seven years, the one thousand six hundred and twenty-three million human beings who are, according to statistics, at present in existence, and that, allowing that some had help, takes time."
"你们说的话也对——我不否认这一点。但同时容我提醒你们，自1866年以来，英国至少有两个女子学院；1880年之后，法律允许一个已婚女人拥有自己的财产；在1919年，也就是整整九年前，女人就已享有选举权。我可否再提醒你们，在十年前，大多数职业就已经向女性敞开大门了。你们考虑一下这些巨大特权，以及她们享有这些特权的时间——事实上，就在此刻一定有大约两千名妇女能够以这种或那种方式每年赚五百多英镑，那么，你就会承认，缺少机会、训练、鼓励、空闲和金钱的借口就都站不住脚了。另外，经济学家告诉我们，西顿太太的孩子太多了。当然，你们一定也会生小孩的，可他们说，要两个三个地生，不要十个十二个地生。","There is truth in what you say—I will not deny it. But at the same time may I remind you that there have been at least two colleges for women in existence in England since the year 1866; that after the year 1880 a married woman was allowed by law to possess her own property; and that in 1919—which is a whole nine years ago she was given a vote?May I also remind you that most of the professions have been open to you for close on ten years now?When you reflect upon these immense privileges and the length of time during which they have been enjoyed, and the fact that there must be at this moment some two thousand women capable of earning over five hundred a year in one way or another, you will agree that the excuse of lack of oppotunity, training, encouragement, leisure and money no longer holds good.Moreover, the economists are telling us that Mrs Seton has had too many children.You must, of course, go on bearing children, but, so they say, in twos and threes, not in tens and twelves."
"这样一来，由于手头上有时间，脑子里有书本知识——而其他方面的知识你们已经足够了，我猜你们被送去上大学的一部分原因就是为了不受教育——这样你们当然就可以开始另一个漫长、劳碌而极其朦胧的职业生涯。有成千支笔愿意建议你们应该做什么以及你们将会受到什么影响。我承认，我本人的意见是有些荒诞，所以我更乐意用小说形式提出建议。","Thus, with some time on your hands and with some book learning in your brains—you have had enough of the other kind, and are sent to college partly, I suspect, to be uneducated—surely you should embark upon another stage of your very long, very laborious and highly obscure career.A thousand pens are ready to suggest what you should do and what effect you will have.My own suggestion is a little fantastic, I admit; I prefer, therefore, to put it in the form of fiction."
"这篇论文中我曾告诉你们，莎士比亚有个妹妹，但不要到悉尼·李爵士写的诗人传记中去找她。她年纪轻轻就死去了——哎，一个字也没写过。她就葬在现在停公共汽车的地方，就在“大象与城堡”酒店对面。现在我相信，这个葬在十字路口、从来没写过一个字的诗人还活着。她就活在你我身上，还活在今晚不在场的其他女人身上，因为她们在洗盘子、照顾孩子睡觉。可她还是活着的，因为伟大的诗人不会死去，而是一直存在的，需要的只是以肉体的形式走在我们中间的机会而已。我觉得，你们现在有能力给她提供这样一个机会。因为我相信，假如我们再活一个世纪左右——我是说我们共有的时间，也就是真正的生活，而不是我们作为个人单独过的小小生活——每人每年有五百镑的收入和自己的房间，假如我们有自由的习惯和记述真实想法的勇气，假如我们能稍稍逃出普通的客厅，从人与现实的角度去观察人类，而不是人与人之间的关系，还要看看天空和大树以及其他任何东西本身，假如我们越过弥尔顿的幽灵去观察，因为没人应该把视野给挡起来，假如我们面对事实——因为它就是一个事实，即没有力量可以依靠，只有我们独自行走，我们的关系是与这个现实世界的关系，而不仅仅是与这个男人和女人的世界的关系，那么，那个机会就会来临，莎士比亚的妹妹这位死去的诗人也就会活在她不常在的躯体上。就像他哥哥在她之前所做的那样，她会在无人知晓的前辈们的生命中汲取她的生命，获得重生。至于她的来临，在没有那种准备、没有我们的那种努力，也没有那种决心——当她再次重生时，她会发现有可能活着并且写她的诗歌——的时候，我们不能期望她的到来，因为那是不可能的。不过我坚持认为，如果我们为她努力，她就会回来，而且，哪怕穷困潦倒，这样的努力也是值得的。","I told you in the course of this paper that Shakespeare had a sister; but do not look for her in Sir Sidney Lee’s life of the poet.She died young—alas, she never wrote a word.She lies buried where the omnibuses now stop, opposite the Elephant and Castle.Now my belief is that this poet who never wrote a word and was buried at the cross-roads still lives.She lives in you and in me, and in many other women who are not here tonight, for they are washing up the dishes and putting the children to bed. But she lives; for great poets do not die; they are continuing presences; they need only the opportunity to walk among us in the flesh.This opportunity, as I think, it is now coming within your power to give her.For my belief is that if we live another century or so—I am talking of the common life which is the real life and not of the little separate lives which we live as individuals—and have five hundred a year each of us and rooms of our own; if we have the habit of freedom and the courage to write exactly what we think; if we escape a little from the common sitting-room and see human beings not always in their relation to each other but in relation to reality, and the sky, too, and the trees or whatever it may be in themselves; if we look past Milton’s bogey, for no human being should shut out the view; if we face the fact, for it is a fact, that there is no arm to cling to, but that we go alone and that our relation is to the world of reality and not only to the world of men and women, then the oppotunity will come and the dead poet who was Shakespeare’s sister will put on the body which she has so often laid down.Drawing her life from the lives of the unknown who were her forerunners, as her brother did before her, she will be born.As for her coming without that preparation, without that effort on our part, without that determination that when she is born again she shall find it possible to live and write her poetry, that we cannot expect, for that would be impossible.But I maintain that she would come if we worked for her, and that so to work, even in poverty and obscurity, is worth while."
