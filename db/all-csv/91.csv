"最后的处方","Let Me Feel Your Pulse "
"作者：欧·亨利","by O. Henry                        "
"于是，我去看了大夫。","So I went to a doctor."
"“你饮酒有多长时间了？”他问道。","“How long has it been since you took any alcohol into your system?” he asked."
"我侧过脸回答道：“哦，有好一阵子了。”","Turning my head sidewise, I answered, “Oh, quite a while.”"
"他是名年轻的大夫，年纪在20岁到40岁之间。他穿着淡紫色的袜子，然而，整个人看起来却像拿破仑。我非常地喜欢他。","He was a young doctor, somewhere between twenty and forty.He wore heliotrope socks, but he looked like Napoleon.I liked him immensely."
"“现在，”他说道，“我要向你展示一下酒精对你的循环系统所产生的影响。”我觉得他说的是“循环”，尽管也可能是“宣传”。","“Now,” said he, “I am going to show you the effect of alcohol upon your circulation.”I think it was “circulation” he said; though it may have been “advertising.”"
"他把我的左衣袖捋到胳膊肘，拿出一瓶威士忌，让我喝一口。他开始越来越像拿破仑了。我也开始越发喜欢他了。","He bared my left arm to the elbow, brought out a bottle of whiskey, and gave me a drink.He began to look more like Napoleon.I began to like him better."
"然后，他用一块敷布紧紧地扎住我的上臂，用手指按住了我的脉搏，并挤捏一个与类似于体温计的仪器连在一起的橡皮球。水银柱上跳下跳，似乎并没有停下来；但是大夫却说它指示237或165这一类数字。","Then he put a tight compress on my upper arm, stopped my pulse with his fingers, and squeezed a rubber bulb connected with an apparatus on a stand that looked like a thermometer.The mercury jumped up and down without seeming to stop anywhere; but the doctor said it registered two hundred and thirty-seven or one hundred and sixty-five or some such number."
"“现在，”他说，“你看到酒精对血压的影响了吧。”","“Now,” said he, “you see what alcohol does to the blood-pressure.”"
"“太神奇了，”我说道，“但是你认为这个试验就够了吗？再给我试验一下吧，试试另一只胳膊。”但是，他没这么做！","“It’s marvellous,” said I, “but do you think it a sufficient test?Have one on me, and let’s try the other arm.”But, no!"
"之后，他一把抓住了我的手。我以为我完了，他这是要和我告别呢。但是，他想做的却只是用一根针在我的指尖扎了一下，并将红色的血滴与固定在卡片上的许多50分的扑克筹码作对比。","Then he grasped my hand.I thought I was doomed and he was saying good-bye.But all he wanted to do was to jab a needle into the end of a finger and compare the red drop with a lot of fifty-cent poker chips that he had fastened to a card."
"“这是血红蛋白化验。”他解释道，“你的血液颜色不对劲。”","“It’s the haemoglobin test,” he explained.“The colour of your blood is wrong.”"
"“嗯，”我说，“我知道它应该是蓝色的。但是，这是个血统混杂的国家。我的祖先有一些是骑士，但他们和楠塔基特岛上的一些人关系很好，所以——”","“Well,” said I, “I know it should be blue; but this is a country of mix-ups.Some of my ancestors were cavaliers; but they got thick with some people on Nantucket Island, so—”"
"“我的意思是，”大夫说道，“红色色度太浅了。”","“I mean,” said the doctor, “that the shade of red is too light.”"
"“噢，”我说，“那就是搭配问题，而不是婚姻问题了。”","“Oh,” said I, “it’s a case of matching instead of matches.”"
"接着，大夫在我的胸部重重地捶了几下。他那么做的时候，我不知道他让我想起的主要是拿破仑、战争，还是英国海军将领纳尔逊勋爵。接着，他表情严肃，提到了一系列肉体凡胎注定承受的病痛——大多数是以“炎”结尾。我立刻预付给他15美元。","The doctor then pounded me severely in the region of the chest.When he did that I don’t know whether he reminded me most of Napoleon or Battling or Lord Nelson.Then he looked grave and mentioned a string of grievances that the flesh is heir to—mostly ending in “itis.”I immediately paid him fifteen dollars on account."
"“在你说的病痛中，有没有哪一种或哪几种一定会致命呢？”我问道。我想，就我与此事的关系，我表现出一定的兴趣是合理的。","“Is or are it or some or any of them necessarily fatal?” I asked.I thought my connection with the matter justified my manifesting a certain amount of interest."
"“全都致命。”他轻松愉快地答道，“但它们的恶化或许可以被抑制住。经过照料和适当的持续治疗，你或许能活到85或90岁。”","“All of them,” he answered cheerfully.“But their progress may be arrested.With care and proper continuous treatment you may live to be eighty-five or ninety.”"
"我想到了大夫的账单。“85就足够了，我确定。”我说。我又预付了他10美元。","I began to think of the doctor’s bill.“Eighty-five would be sufficient, I am sure,” was my comment.I paid him ten dollars more on account."
"“你要做的第一件事，”他重新活跃起来，说道，“就是找个疗养院，在那里彻底地休息一阵子，使你的神经系统进入更好的状态。我会亲自陪你去挑选一个合适的。”","“The first thing to do,” he said, with renewed animation, “is to find a sanitarium where you will get a complete rest for a while, and allow your nerves to get into a better condition.I myself will go with you and select a suitable one.”"
"于是，他把我带到卡茨基尔的一家疯人院。疯人院位于一座秃山上，只有少许几个常客光顾。除了石子和岩石，几摊积雪及零星的几棵松树，你什么也看不到。年轻的主治医师亲切至极。他没有给我的胳膊敷布就给我打了一针兴奋剂。午餐时间到了，我们受邀一起吃午餐。餐厅里的小桌上坐着约摸20个同住者。年轻的主治医师来到我们桌前,说道：“我们这里的风俗是，客人不把自己当病人看，而仅仅看成是来这里休养的疲惫的女士们和先生们。无论他们可能有多么轻微的疾病，在谈话中都不被提及。”","So he took me to a mad-house in the Catskills.It was on a bare mountain frequented only by infrequent frequenters.You could see nothing but stones and boulders, some patches of snow, and scattered pine trees.The young physician in charge was most agreeable.He gave me a stimulant without applying a compress to the arm.It was luncheon time, and we were invited to partake.There were about twenty inmates at little tables in the dining room.The young physician in charge came to our table and said: “It is a custom with our guests not to regard themselves as patients, but merely as tired ladies and gentlemen taking a rest.Whatever slight maladies they may have are never alluded to in conversation.”"
"陪我来的大夫高声叫唤女服务员，让她拿些带有酸橙末的磷酸甘油酸酯、热狗面包、赛尔脱兹溴泡薄饼以及马钱子茶来给我吃。随后，一个声音传出来，仿佛松树林里突然刮起的一阵风暴。声音是由餐厅里的每个客人高声耳语发出的：“神经衰弱！”——只有一个嗅觉敏锐的人例外。我清楚地听到他说：“慢性酒精中毒。”我希望能再见到他。主治医师转身离开了。","My doctor called loudly to a waitress to bring some phosphoglycerate of lime hash, dog-bread, bromo-seltzer pancakes, and nux vomica tea for my repast.Then a sound arose like a sudden wind storm among pine trees.It was produced by every guest in the room whispering loudly, “Neurasthenia!”—except one man with a nose, whom I distinctly heard say, “Chronic alcoholism.”I hope to meet him again.The physician in charge turned and walked away."
"午餐过后一小时左右，主治医生带我们去了工作坊——距疯人院有50码远。在那里，指引客人的是主治医师的替工兼助理——一个现出双腿、身穿蓝色运动衫的高个子男人。他实在是太高了，以至于我都不确定他是否还长着一张脸；不过，盔甲包装公司应该会很满意他的那双手。","An hour or so after luncheon he conducted us to the workshop—say fifty yards from the house.Thither the guests had been conducted by the physician in charge’s understudy and sponge-holder—a man with feet and a blue sweater.He was so tall that I was not sure he had a face; but the Armour Packing Company would have been delighted with his hands."
"“在这里，”主治医师说，“我们的客人通过从事体力劳动——事实上是娱乐，来摆脱过去的精神烦恼，放松自己。”","“Here,” said the physician in charge, “our guests find relaxation from past mental worries by devoting themselves to physical labour—recreation, in reality.”"
"这里有旋转车床、木匠器材、黏土模型工具、手纺车、织布机、跑步机、大鼓、彩色蜡笔画像放大仪和铁匠锻炉等等，一应俱全，看似能引起一流疗养院里自费精神病人们的兴趣。","There were turning-lathes, carpenters’ outfits, clay-modelling tools, spinning-wheels, weaving-frames, treadmills, bass drums, enlarged-crayon-portrait apparatuses, blacksmith forges, and everything, seemingly, that could interest the paying lunatic guests of a first-rate sanitarium."
"“那位在角落里做泥巴馅饼的女士，”主治大夫低声说，“不是别人，正是卢拉·路林顿，小说《爱人为何相爱》的作者。她现在所做的仅仅是在完成那部作品后放松一下大脑。”","“The lady making mud-pies in the corner,” whispered the physician in charge, “is no other than Lula Lulington, the authoress of the novel entitled ‘Why Love Loves.’What she is doing now is simply to rest her mind after performing that piece of work.”"
"我见过那本书。“她为什么不通过再写本书来放松自己呢？”我问。","I had seen the book.“Why doesn’t she do it by writing another one instead?” I asked."
"如你们所见，我并没有他们认为的那样病情严重。","As you see, I wasn’t as far gone as they thought I was."
"“那位往漏斗里灌水的先生，”主治医师继续说道，“是华尔街的一个股票经纪人，因工作过度累垮了。”","“The gentleman pouring water through the funnel,” continued the physician in charge, “is a Wall Street broker broken down from overwork.”"
"我系好外套的扣子。","I buttoned my coat."
"在他所指出的另一些人当中，有玩诺亚方舟的建筑师，有读达尔文《进化论》的部长，有锯木头的律师，有跟那个穿蓝色运动衫的助手讲易卜生剧本的精疲力竭的上流社交名媛，有睡在地板上的神经过敏的百万富翁，还有一个拉着红色小四轮马车满屋子转的杰出艺术家。","Others he pointed out were architects playing with Noah’s arks, ministers reading Darwin’s “Theory of Evolution,” lawyers sawing wood, tired-out society ladies talking Ibsen to the blue-sweatered sponge-holder, a neurotic millionaire lying asleep on the floor, and a prominent artist drawing a little red wagon around the room."
"“你看起来很强壮。”主治医师对我说，“我想，对于你来说，放松精神最好的办法莫过于往山边扔小石子，然后再把它们拾起来。”","“You look pretty strong,” said the physician in charge to me. “I think the best mental relaxation for you would be throwing small boulders over the mountainside and then bringing them up again.”"
"在我的大夫赶上我以前，我已经跑出一百码远了。","I was a hundred yards away before my doctor overtook me."
"“出什么问题了？”他问。","“What’s the matter?” he asked."
"“问题是，”我说，“附近没有飞机可乘。所以，我要愉快而迅速地跑过这条小径，到达那边的火车站，赶乘第一列不定时的烧烟煤的快车回到城里去。”","“The matter is,” said I, “that there are no aeroplanes handy.So I am going to merrily and hastily jog the foot-pathway to yon station and catch the first unlimited-soft-coal express back to town.”"
"“好吧，”大夫说，“或许你是对的。这地方似乎并不适合你。但是，你所需要的就是休息——绝对的休息与锻炼。”","“Well,” said the doctor, “perhaps you are right.This seems hardly the suitable place for you.But what you need is rest—absolute rest and exercise.”"
"那天晚上，我去了城里一家旅馆，对接待员说：“我需要的是绝对的休息与锻炼。你能否给我个配有高折叠床的房间，还有几个男侍者，能在我休息时轮流将床展开再收起？”","That night I went to a hotel in the city, and said to the clerk: “What I need is absolute rest and exercise.Can you give me a room with one of those tall folding beds in it, and a relay of bellboys to work it up and down while I rest?”"
"接待员擦掉了一个指甲上的污迹，侧过脸，眼睛瞥向坐在大厅里的一个头戴白帽子的高个子男人。那个人走了过来，很有礼貌地问我有没有看见西门入口处的灌木丛。我没看见，所以他领我去了那里，然后将我上下打量了一番。","The clerk rubbed a speck off one of his finger nails and glanced sidewise at a tall man in a white hat sitting in the lobby.That man came over and asked me politely if I had seen the shrubbery at the west entrance.I had not, so he showed it to me and then looked me over."
"“我本以为你喝多了，”他和善地说道，“不过现在我不那么认为了。你最好还是去看看大夫吧，老兄。”","“I thought you had ’em,” he said, not unkindly, “but I guess you’re all right.You’d better go see a doctor, old man.”"
"一星期以后，大夫又量了我的血压，不过事先并未给我注射兴奋剂。我觉得他似乎没之前那么像拿破仑了。他的袜子略带棕褐色，对我没什么吸引力。","A week afterward my doctor tested my blood pressure again without the preliminary stimulant.He looked to me a little less like Napoleon.And his socks were of a shade of tan that did not appeal to me."
"“你所需要的，”他果断地说，“是海边的空气和陪伴。”","“What you need,” he decided, “is sea air and companionship.”"
"“会有美人鱼——”我开口说道，但他立刻摆出一副专家的姿态。","“Would a mermaid—” I began; but he slipped on his professional manner."
"“我本人，”他说，“会带你去长岛海滨的博奈尔旅馆，确保你身体健康。那是个安静舒适的度假胜地。在那里，你很快就会康复。”","“I myself,” he said, “will take you to the Hotel Bonair off the coast of Long Island and see that you get in good shape.It is a quiet, comfortable resort where you will soon recuperate.”"
"博奈尔旅馆果真是一家时髦的旅馆。它坐落于主海岸附近的一座岛屿上，拥有九百间客房。凡是不穿礼服去用餐的人都会被挤到一间靠边的餐厅，只能吃水龟、喝香槟。这个海湾是富裕的游艇驾驶者们常来的好地方。我们到的那天，“海盗号”船正好停泊在那里。我看到摩根先生正站在甲板上，一边吃着奶酪三明治，一边向往地凝望着旅馆。尽管如此，来这个地方花不了多少钱。没人付得起他们的价。离开的时候，你只需留下行李，偷一艘小艇，趁夜里偷偷溜回大陆。","The Hotel Bonair proved to be a nine-hundred-room fashionable hostelry on an island off the main shore.Everybody who did not dress for dinner was shoved into a side dining-room and given only a terrapin and champagne table d’hôte.The bay was a great stamping ground for wealthy yachtsmen.The Corsair anchored there the day we arrived.I saw Mr. Morgan standing on deck eating a cheese sandwich and gazing longingly at the hotel.Still, it was a very inexpensive place.Nobody could afford to pay their prices.When you went away you simply left your baggage, stole a skiff, and beat it for the mainland in the night."
"呆在那里的时候，有一天，我从旅店接待员的书桌上拿起一叠有字母组合的空白电报纸，开始给我所有的朋友发电报，想从他们那里拿到逃走的费用。我和我的大夫在高尔夫球场上打了场槌球赛，然后睡在了草坪上。","When I had been there one day I got a pad of monogrammed telegraph blanks at the clerk’s desk and began to wire to all my friends for get-away money.My doctor and I played one game of croquet on the golf links and went to sleep on the lawn."
"就在我们回到城里的时候，他似乎突然想起了什么。“顺便问问，”他问道，“你感觉怎样了？”","When we got back to town a thought seemed to occur to him suddenly.“By the way,” he asked, “how do you feel?”"
"“轻松多了。”我回答说。","“Relieved of very much,” I replied."
"现在，换成会诊医师，情况就不同了。他并不完全肯定能否拿得到诊金，而这种不确定性也就决定了你得到的治疗不是最细心的就是最粗心的。我的大夫带我去看了会诊医师。他猜测有误，这医师竟为我作了精心诊治。我极喜欢他。他让我做了一些协调性运动。","Now a consulting physician is different.He isn’t exactly sure whether he is to be paid or not, and this uncertainty insures you either the most careful or the most careless attention.My doctor took me to see a consulting physician.He made a poor guess and gave me careful attention.I liked him immensely.He put me through some coördination exercises."
"“你后脑勺疼不疼？”他问道。我告诉他不疼。","“Have you a pain in the back of your head?” he asked.I told him I had not."
"“闭上双眼，”他命令道，“双腿并拢，然后向后跳，能跳多远跳多远。”","“Shut your eyes,” he ordered, “put your feet close together, and jump backward as far as you can.”"
"我一直擅长闭着眼睛向后跳，就照做了。我的头撞到了浴室门边上。原来，浴室的门开着，而且离我只有三英尺远。大夫很抱歉。他忽视了门开着这一事实。他关上门。","I always was a good backward jumper with my eyes shut, so I obeyed.My head struck the edge of the bathroom door, which had been left open and was only three feet away.The doctor was very sorry.He had overlooked the fact that the door was open.He closed it."
"“现在，用你的右手食指摸摸你的鼻子。”他说。","“Now touch your nose with your right forefinger,” he said."
"“它在哪儿？”我问。","“Where is it?” I asked."
"“在你脸上。”他说。","“On your face,” said he."
"“我是说我的右手食指。”我解释道。","“I mean my right forefinger,” I explained."
"“哦，不好意思。”他说。他重新打开浴室门，我就从门缝里把手指抽出来了。在我表演完了神奇的摸鼻子技能后，我说：“我不想向你隐瞒症状，大夫；我的后脑勺确实有点儿疼。”","“Oh, excuse me,” said he.He reopened the bathroom door, and I took my finger out of the crack of it.After I had performed the marvellous digito-nasal feat I said: “I do not wish to deceive you as to symptoms, Doctor; I really have something like a pain in the back of my head.”"
"他并没理会这一症状，而是用一个近来流行的投币听音乐器上的耳机一样的东西来仔细地为我作心脏检查。我感觉自己就像是一首民谣。","He ignored the symptom and examined my heart carefully with a latest-popular-air-penny-in-the-slot ear-trumpet.I felt like a ballad."
"“现在，”他说，“像马一样在房间里绕跑五分钟左右。”","“Now,”  he said, “gallop like a horse for about five minutes around the room.”"
"我尽全力模仿一匹从麦迪逊广场公园牵出来的不合格的佩尔什马。随后，大夫没投钱币就又听我的胸口。","I gave the best imitation I could of a disqualified Percheron being led out of Madison Square Garden.Then, without dropping in a penny, he listened to my chest again."
"“大夫，我的家族成员中没人得过鼻疽病。”我说。","“No glanders in our family, Doc.,” I said."
"会诊医师举起他的食指，离我的鼻子不出三英寸远。“看我的手指。”他命令我。","The consulting physician held up his forefinger within three inches of my nose.“Look at my finger,” he commanded."
"“你有没有尝试过皮尔斯的——”我开口说道；但他很快又继续做他的试验了。","“Did you ever try Pears’—” I began; but he went on with his test rapidly."
"“现在，看海湾那边。看我的手指。海湾那边。我的手指。看我的手指。海湾那边。海湾那边。我的手指。海湾那边。”这样的训练持续了大约三分钟。","“Now look across the bay.At my finger.Across the bay.At my finger.At my finger.Across the bay.Across the bay.At my finger.Across the bay.”This for about three minutes."
"他解释说这是大脑活动试验。我觉得这很简单。我一次都没有把他的手指错当成海湾。我敢打赌，如果他是这样说的：“漫不经心地注视着外面——或者，旁边一些——目光投向地平线的方向，换言之，就是水天相接的地方。”然后再说，“现在，回过头来——或者说，收回你的注意力，把它集中在我竖起的手指上。”——若是这样，我敢打赌，能通过这个试验的就只有亨利·詹姆斯自己了。","He explained that this was a test of the action of the brain.It seemed easy to me.I never once mistook his finger for the bay.I’ll bet that if he had used the phrases: “Gaze, as it were, unpreoccupied, outward—or rather laterally—in the direction of the horizon, underlaid, so to speak, with the adjacent fluid inlet,” and “Now, returning—or rather, in a manner, withdrawing your attention, bestow it upon my upraised digit”—I’ll bet, I say, that Henry James himself could have passed the examination."
"在问我有没有脊背弯曲的叔叔或脚踝肿胀的堂兄弟后，两位大夫退到浴室，坐在澡盆边上探讨诊断情况。我吃了一个苹果，先看了一下手指，然后看向海湾那边。","After asking me if I had ever had a grand uncle with curvature of the spine or a cousin with swelled ankles, the two doctors retired to the bathroom and sat on the edge of the bath tub for their consultation.I ate an apple, and gazed first at my finger and then across the bay."
"两位大夫出来了，一脸严肃的表情。不仅如此，他们像墓碑一样立在那里一声不吭。他们列出了一份我要严格遵守的饮食清单。除了蜗牛以外，凡是我听过的能吃的东西，都在清单上了。我从不吃蜗牛，除非它突然袭击我，先咬我一口。","The doctors came out looking grave.More: they looked tombstones and Tennessee-papers-please-copy.They wrote out a diet list to which I was to be restricted.It had everything that I had ever heard of to eat on it, except snails.And I never eat a snail unless it overtakes me and bites me first."
"“你必须严格遵守这个食谱。”两位大夫说。","“You must follow this diet strictly,” said the doctors."
"“如果清单上的东西我能得到十分之一的话，我一定严格遵守。”我回答说。","“I’d follow it a mile if I could get one-tenth of what’s on it,” I answered."
"“还有一点很重要，”他们继续说，“那就是室外空气和锻炼。这是一张处方，对你极为有益。”","“Of next importance,” they went on, “is outdoor air and exercise.And here is a prescription that will be of great benefit to you.”"
"然后，我们都拿了自己的东西。他们拿了帽子，我告辞了。","Then all of us took something.They took their hats, and I took my departure."
"我去了药剂师那里，给他看了处方。","I went to a druggist and showed him the prescription."
"“配起来的话，一盎司的小瓶，每瓶要两美元八十七分。”他说道。","“It will be $2.87 for an ounce bottle,” he said."
"“能给我一根包扎绳吗？”我说。","“Will you give me a piece of your wrapping cord?” said I."
"我在处方上弄了一个洞，把绳穿过去，系在脖子上，然后把它塞进了衣服里。我们大家都有点儿迷信，我就很迷信护身符。","I made a hole in the prescription, ran the cord through it, tied it around my neck, and tucked it inside.All of us have a little superstition, and mine runs to a confidence in amulets."
"当然了，我并没有什么问题，但是，我病得很重。我不能工作、睡觉、吃饭，也不能玩保龄球。我能获得同情的唯一方法就是连续四天不刮胡子就出门。即便如此，还是会有人说：“老兄，你看起来像松树结一样结实。你去缅因州森林里远足了，呃？”","Of course there was nothing the matter with me, but I was very ill.I couldn’t work, sleep, eat, or bowl.The only way I could get any sympathy was to go without shaving for four days.Even then somebody would say: “Old man, you look as hardy as a pine knot.Been up for a jaunt in the Maine woods, eh?”"
"随后，我突然想起我必须要有室外空气和锻炼。于是，我南下去了约翰家里。根据一位牧师的判断，约翰同我近似亲戚。那位牧师站在菊花围绕的凉亭里，手捧一本小书，数万人在一旁观看。约翰有一处乡间住宅，距派恩维尔有七英里远。它坐落于蓝岭山脉之上，海拔很高，庄严肃穆，不食人间烟火。约翰就像是云母，比金子还要珍贵、晶莹。","Then, suddenly, I remembered that I must have outdoor air and exercise.So I went down South to John’s.John is an approximate relative by verdict of a preacher standing with a little book in his hands in a bower of chrysanthemums while a hundred thousand people looked on.John has a country house seven miles from Pineville.It is at an altitude and on the Blue Ridge Mountains in a state too dignified to be dragged into this controversy.John is mica, which is more valuable and clearer than gold."
"他是到派恩维尔接的我，然后，我们乘索道吊车去了他家。他家是个大农舍，坐落于一座小山丘上，周围全是山峰，一个邻居都没有。我们在他的私人小站点下了车，约翰的家人和阿玛丽丽丝在那里迎接问候了我们。阿玛丽丽丝有些局促不安地看着我。","He met me at Pineville, and we took the trolley car to his home.It is a big, neighbourless cottage on a hill surrounded by a hundred mountains.We got off at his little private station, where John’s family and Amaryllis met and greeted us.Amaryllis looked at me a trifle anxiously."
"在去约翰家的山路上，一只兔子在我们前面蹦蹦跳跳地出现了。我扔下手提箱，急忙追赶它。跑了20码以后，兔子不见了。我坐在草地上，悲伤地哭了起来。","A rabbit came bounding across the hill between us and the house.I threw down my suit-case and pursued it hotfoot.After I had run twenty yards and seen it disappear, I sat down on the grass and wept disconsolately."
"“我连一只兔子都抓不到了。”我抽泣着说，“我在这世上再也没什么用了。我还不如死了算了。”","“I can’t catch a rabbit any more,” I sobbed. “I’m of no further use in the world.I may as well be dead.”"
"“噢，怎么了——发生了什么事，约翰哥？”我听见阿玛丽丽丝说道。","“Oh, what is it—what is it, Brother John?” I heard Amaryllis say."
"“有点儿神经衰弱。”约翰镇静地说道，“别担心。起来吧，你这个追兔子的人，我们得在饼干变冷之前赶回家去啊。”黄昏将近，周围的山峰威严耸立，正如默弗里小姐所描写的那样。","“Nerves a little unstrung,” said John, in his calm way. “ Don’t worry.Get up, you rabbit-chaser, and come on to the house before the biscuits get cold.”It was about twilight, and the mountains came up nobly to Miss Murfree’s descriptions of them."
"晚饭后不久，我向大家宣布，我相信我能接连睡上一两年，包括法定节假日。于是，我被带到一个房间。房间既宽敞又凉爽，简直就像座花园，里面那张床有草坪那么宽。很快，家中的其他人都就寝了。一片宁静笼罩在大地之上。","Soon after dinner I announced that I believed I could sleep for a year or two, including legal holidays.So I was shown to a room as big and cool as a flower garden, where there was a bed as broad as a lawn.Soon afterward the remainder of the household retired, and then there fell upon the land a silence."
"我已经有很多年没有享受这种宁静了。真是万籁无声。我用胳膊肘拄在床上，倾听着。睡觉！我想，倘若只能听到星星眨眼或草叶抽尖的声音，我便能入睡。有一次，我以为自己听到了类似独桅艇在微风中转向风帆拍打的声音，但后来我断定，那或许只是地毯中大头钉所发出的声音啊。我依旧倾听着。","I had not heard a silence before in years.It was absolute.I raised myself on my elbow and listened to it.Sleep!I thought that if I only could hear a star twinkle or a blade of grass sharpen itself I could compose myself to rest.I thought once that I heard a sound like the sail of a catboat flapping as it veered about in a breeze, but I decided that it was probably only a tack in the carpet.Still I listened."
"突然，一只迟归的小鸟飞落在窗台上，用它那无疑自认为困倦的音调鸣叫着，也就是人们所说的“啁啾”！","Suddenly some belated little bird alighted upon the window-sill, and, in what he no doubt considered sleepy tones, enunciated the noise generally translated as “cheep!”"
"我一跃而起。","I leaped into the air."
"“喂！楼下发生了什么事？”楼上房间里传出约翰的叫声。","“Hey! what’s the matter down there?” called John from his room above mine."
"“哦，没什么。”我回答说，“只是我一不小心，脑袋撞到天花板了。”","“Oh, nothing,” I answered, “except that I accidentally bumped my head against the ceiling.”"
"次日清晨，我来到门廊，眺望山峰。看到了其中的47座山。我打了个冷战，走进大起居室，从书架上挑选了一本名为《潘科斯特家庭医药全书》的书籍，读了起来。这时，约翰走了进来，拿走了我手里的书，领我来到外面。他有一个占地三百英亩的农场，配有谷仓、骡子、雇工以及断了三个前齿的耙子等常用设备。我儿时就见过这些东西，情绪不免低落了下来。","The next morning I went out on the porch and looked at the mountains.There were forty-seven of them in sight.I shuddered, went into the big hall sitting room of the house, selected “Pancoast’s Family Practice of Medicin” from a bookcase, and began to read.John came in, took the book away from me, and led me outside.He has a farm of three hundred acres furnished with the usual complement of barns, mules, peasantry, and harrows with three front teeth broken off.I had seen such things in my childhood, and my heart began to sink."
"接着，约翰谈起了紫苜蓿，我立刻高兴了起来。“噢，是的。”我说，“她不是合唱队里的吗——让我想想——”","Then John spoke of alfalfa, and I brightened at once.“Oh, yes,” said I, “wasn’t she in the chorus of—let’s see—”"
"“很绿，你知道的，”约翰说，“也很嫩，第一茬过后，就要把地翻一下。”","“Green, you know,” said John, “and tender, and you plow it under after the first season.”"
"“我知道，”我说，“她上面会长出青草。”","“I know,” said I, “and the grass grows over her.”"
"“对。”约翰说，“你对农业到底还是有些了解的。”","“Right,” said John. “You know something about farming, after all.”"
"“我对有些农民也略知一二，”我说，“总有一天，手持长柄大镰刀的死神定会将他们铲除掉。”","“I know something of some farmers,” said I, “and a sure scythe will mow them down some day.”"
"回屋途中，一个美丽而神秘的生物横穿过我们的小路。我停住脚步，不由自主地被它吸引了，凝视着它。约翰抽着烟，耐心地等待着。他是个现代农民。十分钟后，他说：“你打算一整天都站在那儿看着那只鸡吗？早餐快准备好了。”","On the way back to the house a beautiful and inexplicable creature walked across our path.I stopped irresistibly fascinated, gazing at it.John waited patiently, smoking his cigarette.He is a modern farmer.After ten minutes he said: “Are you going to stand there looking at that chicken all day?Breakfast is nearly ready.”"
"“一只鸡？”我说道。","“A chicken?” said I."
"“一只奥尔平顿白母鸡，如果你想知道得具体些。”","“A White Orpington hen, if you want to particularize.”"
"“一只奥尔平顿白母鸡？”我饶有兴趣地重复了一遍。那只鸡慢慢走开了，步态高贵优雅。我跟在后面，就像小孩子跟着花衣魔笛手那样。约翰允许我再呆五分钟，然后，他拉着我的衣袖，带我去吃早餐。","“A White Orpington hen?” I repeated, with intense interest.The fowl walked slowly away with graceful dignity, and I followed like a child after the Pied Piper.Five minutes more were allowed me by John, and then he took me by the sleeve and conducted me to breakfast."
"在那里呆了一个星期以后，我开始变得焦虑起来。我吃得好睡得好，真的开始享受生活了。对于我这种身处绝境的人来说，那是绝对不可能的事情。于是，我偷偷溜到索道吊车站，乘吊车去了派恩维尔，到镇上最好的一个医师那里去看病。此时此刻，我完全知道，接受药物治疗时我要怎么做。我把帽子挂在椅背上，快速地说：","After I had been there a week I began to grow alarmed.I was sleeping and eating well and actually beginning to enjoy life.For a man in my desperate condition that would never do.So I sneaked down to the trolley-car station, took the car for Pineville, and went to see one of the best physicians in town.By this time I knew exactly what to do when I needed medical treatment.I hung my hat on the back of a chair, and said rapidly: "
"“大夫，我患有心脏肝硬化、动脉硬化、神经衰弱、神经炎、急性消化不良以及康复期病症等疾病。我要严格规定自己的饮食。我要晚上泡个温水澡，早上冲个冷水澡。我要努力使自己高兴起来，把心思集中在令人愉快的事情上。药物方面，我打算服用含磷药片，一日三次，最好饭后服用。同时，还要喝一种由龙胆根酊剂、金鸡纳皮、黄金鸡纳皮以及豆蔻混合物配制而成的补药。每一茶匙补药里我都要添加马钱子酊剂；起初加入一滴，以后每天都增加一滴，直到最后达到最大剂量。我会使用药物点滴器来操作。这种点滴器不仅价格低，而且随便哪家药店都买得到。告辞。”","“Doctor, I have cirrhosis of the heart, indurated arteries, neurasthenia, neuritis, acute indigestion, and convalescence.I am going to live on a strict diet.I shall also take a tepid bath at night and a cold one in the morning.I shall endeavour to be cheerful, and fix my mind on pleasant subjects.In the way of drugs I intend to take a phosphorous pill three times a day, preferably after meals, and a tonic composed of the tinctures of gentian, cinchona, calisaya, and cardamon compound.Into each teaspoonful of this I shall mix tincture of nux vomica, beginning with one drop and increasing it a drop each day until the maximum dose is reached.I shall drop this with a medicine-dropper, which can be procured at a trifling cost at any pharmacy.Good morning.”"
"我拿了帽子，走了出去。刚一关上门，我便想起有事忘说了。我再次打开门。大夫还坐在原来的位置上，没有移动。不过，再次见到我，他不禁稍稍紧张地吓了一跳。","I took my hat and walked out.After I had closed the door I remembered something that I had forgotten to say.I opened it again.The doctor had not moved from where he had been sitting, but he gave a slightly nervous start when he saw me again."
"“我忘记说了，”我说道，“我还要有绝对的休息和锻炼。”","“I forgot to mention,” said I, “that I shall also take absolute rest and exercise.”"
"这次就诊之后，我觉得好多了。再次想到自己已病得无药可救了，我感到非常满意，几乎又变得郁郁寡欢了。对于一个神经衰弱患者来说，最令人担忧的事情莫过于觉得自己越来越健康快乐。","After this consultation I felt much better.The reestablishing in my mind of the fact that I was hopelessly ill gave me so much satisfaction that I almost became gloomy again.There is nothing more alarming to a neurasthenic than to feel himself growing well and cheerful."
"约翰悉心照顾我。在我表示对那只奥尔平顿白母鸡饶有兴趣之后，约翰竭尽全力转移我的注意力，晚上还特意把鸡舍门锁上。逐渐地，提神的山区空气、健康的食物以及每天的山间散步极大地缓解了我的疾病，使我变得彻底悲伤、沮丧了。我听说附近山区有个乡村大夫。我就去了他那里，把事情始末全告诉了他。他留着灰白胡子，布满皱纹的蓝眼睛清澈明亮，身穿家中自制的灰色牛仔衣。","John looked after me carefully.After I had evinced so much interest in his White Orpington chicken he tried his best to divert my mind, and was particular to lock his hen house of nights.Gradually the tonic mountain air, the wholesome food, and the daily walks among the hills so alleviated my malady that I became utterly wretched and despondent.I heard of a country doctor who lived in the mountains nearby.I went to see him and told him the whole story.He was a gray-bearded man with clear, blue, wrinkled eyes, in a home-made suit of gray jeans."
"为了节约时间，我自己诊断了起来：用右手食指摸摸鼻子，敲击膝盖下方，以使脚踢起来。再听听胸膛，伸伸舌头，又问了他派恩维尔墓地的价格。","In order to save time I diagnosed my case, touched my nose with my right forefinger, struck myself below the knee to make my foot kick, sounded my chest, stuck out my tongue, and asked him the price of cemetery lots in Pineville."
"他点燃了烟斗，盯着我看了约有三分钟。“老兄，”过了一会儿，他说，“你的情况非常不妙啊。虽然有康复的可能，但希望很渺茫啊。”","He lit his pipe and looked at me for about three minutes.“Brother,” he said, after a while, “you are in a mighty bad way.There’s a chance for you to pull through, but it’s a mighty slim one.”"
"“是什么希望？”我急切地问。","“What can it be?” I asked eagerly."
"“我尝试过砷、金、磷、运动、马钱子、水治疗法、休息、刺激、可待因以及氨水芳香酒精。药典中，还有什么漏了尝试吗？”","“I have taken arsenic and gold, phosphorus, exercise, nux vomica, hydrotherapeutic baths, rest, excitement, codein, and aromatic spirits of ammonia.Is there anything left in the pharmacopœia?”"
"“这个山区的某个地方，”大夫说，“生长着一种植物——一种开花植物。它能治好你的病，而且，恐怕也只有它能救你了。这种植物极其古老，近来又很稀缺，很难找到。你我将不得不去搜寻啊。我现在已经不给人看病了。我年事已高，但你的病我还是会看的。你以后每天下午都要到我这儿来，帮我寻找这种植物，直到找到为止。城里的大夫可能十分了解新科技事物；然而，对于大自然携在马鞍囊里的草药，他们就知之甚少了。”","“Somewhere in these mountains,” said the doctor, “there’s a plant growing—a flowering plant that’ll cure you, and it’s about the only thing that will.It’s of a kind that’s as old as the world; but of late it’s powerful scarce and hard to find.You and I will have to hunt it up.I’m not engaged in active practice now: I’m getting along in years; but I’ll take your case.You’ll have to come every day in the afternoon and help me hunt for this plant till we find it.The city doctors may know a lot about new scientific things, but they don’t know much about the cures that nature carries around in her saddlebags.”"
"于是，老大夫和我每天都在蓝岭山脉的山峰谷地里寻觅那包治百病的植物。我们一起艰难地爬上陡峭的山峰。山坡落满了秋叶，脚下直打滑。为免跌落下去，我们不得不抓住每一棵够得着的小树和大树枝。我们跋涉于峡谷罅隙之中，那里的月桂树和蕨类植物有胸那么高；我们沿着山间溪流走了几英里；随后又蜿蜒前行，就像印第安人穿行于松树林中——路边、山头、河边、山边，我们到处寻找那神奇的植物。","So every day the old doctor and I hunted the cure-all plant among the mountains and valleys of the Blue Ridge.Together we toiled up steep heights so slippery with fallen autumn leaves that we had to catch every sapling and branch within our reach to save us from falling.We waded through gorges and chasms, breast-deep with laurel and ferns; we followed the banks of mountain streams for miles; we wound our way like Indians through brakes of pine—road side, hill side, river side, mountain side we explored in our search for the miraculous plant."
"正如老大夫所说，这种植物必定是日渐稀少，不易找到了。但是，我们仍然继续找寻。日复一日，我们探寻山谷，攀登高峰，跨越高原，寻找那神奇的植物。他是山里土生土长的人，似乎从不感觉疲惫。回到家里，我常常累得什么也不想做，只是倒在床上，一觉睡到天明。就这样，我们坚持了一个月。","As the old doctor said, it must have grown scarce and hard to find.But we followed our quest.Day by day we plumbed the valleys, scaled the heights, and tramped the plateaus in search of the miraculous plant.Mountain-bred, he never seemed to tire.I often reached home too fatigued to do anything except fall into bed and sleeping until morning.This we kept up for a month."
"一天傍晚，我和老大夫跋涉六英里之后回来，就和阿玛丽丽丝到路边树下散步去了。我们眺望着披上深紫色睡袍准备睡觉的群山。","One evening after I had returned from a six-mile tramp with the old doctor, Amaryllis and I took a little walk under the trees near the road.We looked at the mountains drawing their royal-purple robes around them for their night’s repose."
"“看到你康复了，我真开心。”她说，“你刚来的时候把我吓坏了。我还以为你真得了什么病呢。”","“I’m glad you’re well again,” she said. “When you first came you frightened me.I thought you were really ill.”"
"“又好了！”我几乎尖叫出来，“你知道吗？我活下来的几率只有千分之一。”","“Well again!” I almost shrieked. “Do you know that I have only one chance in a thousand to live?”"
"阿玛丽丽丝吃惊地看着我。“怎么会啊？”她说，“你可壮得像头耕地的骡子啊，每晚睡上十或十二个小时，胃口好得都快把我家吃穷了。你还想要怎么样啊？”","Amaryllis looked at me in surprise.“Why,” said she, “you are as strong as one of the plough-mules, you sleep ten or twelve hours every night, and you are eating us out of house and home.What more do you want?”"
"“我跟你说，”我说，“除非我们能找到魔法——也就是我们正在寻觅的植物，否则，什么也救不了我。大夫是这么告诉我的。”","“I tell you,” said I, “that unless we find the magic—that is, the plant we are looking for—in time, nothing can save me.The doctor tells me so.”"
"“什么大夫？”","“What doctor?”"
"“塔特姆大夫——那个住在黑橡树山山腰的老大夫。你认识他吗？”","“Doctor Tatum—the old doctor who lives halfway up Black Oak Mountain.Do you know him?”"
"“打从我会说话起，就认识他了。这么说，你每天就是去那儿——由他带着你长途跋涉、翻山越岭，使你恢复了健康和体力？愿上帝保佑老大夫吧。”","“I have known him since I was able to talk.And is that where you go every day—is it he who takes you on these long walks and climbs that have brought back your health and strength?God bless the old doctor.”"
"就在这时，老大夫亲自驾着他那辆摇摇晃晃的轻便马车徐徐而来。我向他挥挥手，高声说明天同一时间还会去他那里。他停下马车，叫阿玛丽丽丝到他那里去。他们谈了五分钟，我则在那儿等着。然后，老大夫继续驾车离开了。","Just then the old doctor himself drove slowly down the road in his rickety old buggy.I waved my hand at him and shouted that I would be on hand the next day at the usual time.He stopped his horse and called to Amaryllis to come out to him.They talked for five minutes while I waited.Then the old doctor drove on."
"回到家后，阿玛丽丽丝拿出一本百科全书，在里面寻找一个词。“大夫说了，”她告诉我，“你不必再以病人的身份去拜访他了。不过，他随时都很高兴见到你这个朋友。然后，他又叫我在百科全书里查找我自己的名字，并告诉你它的含义。那似乎是一种开花属植物的名字，也是忒奥克里托斯和维吉尔作品里一个乡村女孩的名字。你知道大夫这话是什么意思吗？”","When we got to the house Amaryllis lugged out an encyclopædia and sought a word in it.“The doctor said,” she told me, “that you needn’t call any more as a patient, but he’d be glad to see you any time as a friend.And then he told me to look up my name in the encyclopædia and tell you what it means.It seems to be the name of a genus of flowering plants, and also the name of a country girl in Theocritus and Virgil.What do you suppose the doctor meant by that?”"
"“我知道他的意思了。”我说，“我现在知道了。”","“I know what he meant,” said I. “I know now.”"
"对于可能遭受焦虑的“神经衰弱夫人”迷惑的兄弟们，我要奉劝一句。","A word to a brother who may have come under the spell of the unquiet Lady Neurasthenia."
"那个配方很正确啊。虽然有时暗中摸索，但城里的大夫还是找到了特效药啊。","The formula was true.Even though gropingly at times, the physicians of the walled cities had put their fingers upon the specific medicament."
"所以，为了锻炼而被介绍给了黑橡树山的好大夫塔特姆——到了松树林里的卫理公会教徒集会所以后，往右手边的路走。","And so for the exercise one is referred to good Doctor Tatum on Black Oak Mountain—take the road to your right at the Methodist meeting house in the pine-grove."
"绝对的休息与锻炼！","Absolute rest and exercise!"
"和阿玛丽丽丝坐在树阴下，带着直觉阅读忒奥克里托斯笔下无言的田园诗，感受诗中镶着金边的青山，秩序井然地走进夜的宿舍，还有什么能比这样的休息更有疗效呢？","What rest more remedial than to sit with Amaryllis in the shade, and, with a sixth sense, read the wordless Theocritan idyl of the gold-bannered blue mountains marching orderly into the dormitories of the night?"
