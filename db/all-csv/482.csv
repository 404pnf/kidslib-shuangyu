"一个好心人的奇迹","A Good Man’s Miracle"
"作者：纳撒尼尔·霍桑","by Nathaniel Hawthorne"
"每个善良的举动之中都蕴含一份高尚的品质，这种品质并不随着那一特定行为的完成而终结，而是继续不断地推动人们做好事。有一条传递福报的链条，它从这世间每个好心人平凡而善良的行动开始延伸，直至天堂，那里的天使们欣然接手，持续着爱的行动。不过，肉眼凡胎的我们，确是不太可能探寻到这条福链。但是，有时我们或许能从某件事中清楚地看到这种奇妙而美丽的连接。我总是觉得，发生在罗伯特·雷克斯先生生活中的那件广为人知的事情，给我们提供了最具希望最激动人心的论据，即永远不要忽视行善的机会，哪怕是最微小的机会，因为我们不知道那样做究竟会推动上帝何种深不可测的旨意。这则小故事已经讲过很多次了，但这里要重新讲述一下，因为它鲜明地印证了我们开篇所说的话。","In every good action there is a divine quality, which does not end with the completion of that particular deed but goes on to bring forth good works in an infinite series.It is seldom possible, indeed, for human eyes to trace out the chain of blessed consequences, that extends from a benevolent man’s simple and conscientious act, here on earth, and connects it with those labors of love which the angels make it their joy to perform, in Heaven above.Sometimes, however, we meet with an instance in which this wonderful and glorious connection may clearly be perceived.It has always appeared to me, that a well-known incident in the life of Mr. Robert Raikes offers us one of the most hopeful and inspiring arguments, never to neglect even the humblest opportunities of doing good, as not knowing what vast purposes of Providence we may thereby subserve.This little story has been often told, but may here be related anew, because it so strikingly illustrates the remark with which we began."
"有一天，在伦敦时候，雷克斯先生碰巧要穿过一条街，那条街上的大部分居民都是贫穷而不学无术的人。大城市里，情况总是这样不幸，穷人被迫跟一帮品行不端的人做邻居；不学无术之徒身边有那么多诱惑，又没有好心的明白人引导他们走正路，所以他们几乎无一幸免地走上邪路，坏人的数量也多了起来。因此，像伦敦这样的大城市里，在那些充斥着恶行的偏僻街区里，虽然也有很多品性善良的穷人，但他们似乎只是靠上帝特殊的眷顾才得以保存着善性。假如上帝将视线转移片刻，那么一直环绕在他们身边如洪水般的邪恶将把他们吞噬。现在，雷克斯先生边走边看，很多景象让他觉得心痛，因为街道两边有太多的悲惨和罪恶，大多数人都不抱什么做善事的希望，只求尽快忘掉眼前这片景象。","Mr. Raikes, being in London, happened one day to pass through a certain street, which was inhabited chiefly by poor and ignorant people.In great cities, it is unfortunately the case, that the poor are compelled to be the neighbors and fellow-lodgers of the vicious; and that the ignorant seeing so much temptation around them, and having no kind advisers to direct them aright, almost inevitably go astray and increase the number of the bad.Thus, though doubtless there are many virtuous poor people, amidst all the vice that hides itself in the obscure streets of a great city, like London, still it seems as if they were kept virtuous only by the special providence of God.If He should turn away His eyes for a single instant, they would be lost in the flood of evil that continually surrounds them.Now, Mr. Raikes, as he passed along, saw much to make him sad, for there were so many tokens of sin and wretchedness on all sides, that most persons, hopeless of doing any good, would have endeavored to forget the whole scene as soon as possible."
"世上几乎没有哪种景象比伦敦那些偏僻的街道更凄惨了。房子破旧衰败，一座座紧紧地挤在一块，几乎把天空遮蔽了。就连投下来的一缕阳光也在城市烟雾的笼罩下显得朦胧灰暗。一条流淌着污浊脏水的阴沟沿街流过。房子一派乱七八糟的样子，说明住在这里的人不喜欢自己的房子，也不会为把房子收拾得干净体面而感到自豪。这些房子里，恐怕住着很多生病的人，吃不上饭的人，和冻得发抖的人，唉，还有不少人已滋生出邪恶的念头，试图通过卑劣的手段让日子好得过点。总之，这条街似乎就是这样一个天使不降临、好人也不去的地方。但是，好心人是应该经常去那里走走的，让这里的景象勾起一些悲伤之情，正如雷克斯先生现在脑中所想，这样或许能触动他们的心，以试图改善。","There is hardly a gloomier spectacle in the world than one of those obscure streets of London.The houses, which were old and ruinous, stood so close together as almost to shut out the sky, and even the sunshine, where a glimpse of it could be seen, was made dusky and dim by the smoke of the city.A kennel of muddy water flowed through the street.The general untidiness about the houses proved that the inhabitants felt no affection for their homes, nor took pride in making them decent and respectable.In these houses, it is to be feared that there were many people sick, suffering for food, and shivering with cold, and many, alas! who had fallen into the sore disease of sin, and sought to render their lives easier by dishonest practices.In short, the street seemed a place seldom visited by angels of mercy, or trodden by the footsteps of good men.Yet it were well that good men should often go thither, and be saddened by such reflections as now occurred to Mr. Raikes, in order that their hearts might be stirred up to attempt a reformation."
"“唉，这里怎么是这样一副惨象！”这位好心人暗自寻思着。“早晨在自家周围散步就面对这么多亟待整治的邪恶，这怎能让一个基督徒无动于衷呢？”","“Alas, what a spectacle is here!” thought this good man to himself.“How can any Christian remain idle, when there is so much evil to be remedied within a morning’s walk of his own home?”"
"但我们尚未说明到底是什么感动了雷克斯先生的心，让他悲痛怜悯。街上有孩子在玩。有些孩子在阴沟里嬉水，向伙伴们泼洒脏水，而这只是因为淘气爱玩而已。有些孩子已然学会了赌博，正在玩掷硬币游戏，每次赌半便士。另一些孩子好像在吵架、打架。总之——因为我们不愿再描述所看到的让人伤心的一幕幕——这些可怜的孩子在无所事事地混日子，眼前有的只是些坏榜样，他们没有机会学习任何知识，除了邪恶。他们脏兮兮的小脸上已经因顽劣显得老成，好像世间的邪恶与悲惨伴随着他们降生，并在他们有生之年一直缠着他们。这般景象怎能不令雷克斯先生伤心，他总是很喜欢小孩子，似乎觉得是孩子们灿烂幸福的笑脸让这个世界更加美丽，也让自己的心越来越善良。但是，他边注视着这些可怜的小家伙边想，世界从来没像现在这样黑暗、丑陋和悲惨过。","But we have not yet mentioned what it was that chiefly moved the heart of Mr. Raikes with sorrow and compassion.There were children at play in the street.Some were dabbling in the kennel, and splashing its dirty water over their companions, out of the mere love of mischief.Others, who had already been taught to gamble, were playing at pitch-and-toss for half-pence.Others, perhaps, were quarelling and fighting.In a word—for we will not describe what it was so sad to witness—these poor children were growing up in idleness, with none but bad examples before their eyes, and without the opportunity of learning anything but evil.Their little, unclean faces looked already old in naughtiness; it seemed as if the vice and misery of the world had been born with them, and would cling to them as long as they existed.How sad a spectacle was this for a man like Mr. Raikes, who had always delighted in little children, and felt as if the world was made more beautiful, and his own heart the better, by their bright and happy faces!But, as he gazed at these poor little creatures, he thought that the world had never looked so dark, ugly, and sorrowful, as it did then."
"“啊，我可以拯救他们！”他想，“他们这样成长在一个基督教国家，还不如生在最原始的野蛮人中间。”","“Oh, that I could save them!” thought he.“It were better for them to have been born among the wildest savages, than to grow up thus in a Christian country.”"
"此时，在一间房子门口站着一位妇女，虽然她看上去贫困艰苦，却比这条肮脏的街道上的其他人显得更加干净体面。和雷克斯先生一样，她也在注视着孩子们，或许她满脑子想的也跟他一样。也许是这样：她有自己的孩子，一想到他们必须在这样恶劣的榜样中间成长，她便忍不住流下泪来。无论如何，当雷克斯先生看到这位妇女的时候，他便觉得好像找到了一个能理解他的悲伤和忧虑的人。","Now, at the door of one of the houses, there stood a woman, who, though she looked poor and needy, yet seemed neater and more respectable than the other inhabitants of this wretched street.She, like Mr. Raikes, was gazing at the children; and perhaps her mind was occupied with reflections similar to his.It might be, that she had children of her own, and was ready to shed tears at the thought, that they must grow up in the midst of such bad examples.At all events, when Mr. Raikes beheld this woman, he felt as if he had found somebody that could sympathize with him in his grief and anxiety."
"“善良的夫人，”他指着孩子们说，“多么凄惨的景象——这么多上帝的子民在无所事事、愚昧无知中长大，无人教导，只有作恶。”","“My good woman,” said he, pointing to the children, “this is a dismal sight—so many of God’s creatures growing up in idleness and ignorance, with no instruction but to do evil.”"
"“唉，善良的先生，”妇女回答说，“正如你所见，平时情况已经糟透了，但你要是星期天再来这条街，你会发现情况要比现在糟糕一千倍。其他日子里，不管工作好赖，一些孩子会出去找些差事；但安息日他们都得一起回到这条街上——于是从早到晚他们都在调皮捣蛋。”","“Alas, good Sir,” answered the woman, “it is bad enough on week-days, as you see;—but if you were to come into the street on a Sunday, you would find it a thousand times worse.On other days some of the children find employment, good or bad; but the Sabbath brings them all into the street together—and then there is nothing but mischief from morning till night.”"
"“啊，那确实让人痛心啊，”雷克斯先生说，“难道神圣的安息日没给这群可怜的孩子们带来祝福吗？这才是最糟糕的事情。”","“Ah, that is a sad case indeed,” said Mr. Raikes.“Can the blessed Sabbath itself bring no blessing to these poor children?This is the worst of all.”"
"他又一次沿街望去，满怀怜悯和强烈的慈爱之情，因为他的整个心已被眼前的一切感动。他越是想，越是觉得可怕，似乎这些孩子就要在无知和罪恶中成长，而上帝在他们心中播下的永恒的善良之种就要因为忽视而永远枯萎。他一片挚诚的怜悯之心让他迫不及待地思考应该做点什么。正当他站着注视眼前让他万分伤心的情景时，他脸上突然露出愉快而充满希望的表情，使得他的脸颊看上去好像有一抹阳光划过。假如道德的阳光能投射到物体上，那么这样的一缕光芒已经照亮了这条阴暗的街道，照亮了所有灰暗的窗户，让这些可怜的孩子们看上去美丽快乐。幸福的光芒不仅会出现在那条凄惨的大街上，而且已经从那里洒遍全球，因为此时雷克斯先生脑中有了一个想法，这个想法在不久的将来注定会让整个世界比以往任何时候都更加明亮。","And then, again, he looked along the street, with pity and strong benevolence; for his whole heart was moved by what he saw.The longer he considered, the more terrible did it appear that those children should grow up in ignorance and sin, and that the germs of immortal goodness, which Heaven had implanted in their souls, should be for ever blighted by neglect.And the earnestness of his compassion quickened his mind to perceive what was to be done.As he stood gazing at the spectacle that had so saddened him, an expression of delightful hope broke forth upon his face, and made it look as if a bright gleam of sunshine fell across it.And, if moral sunshine could be discerned on physical objects, just such a brightness would have shone through the gloomy street, gladdening all the dusky windows, and causing the poor children to look beautiful and happy.Not only in that wretched street would the light of gladness have appeared; it might have spread from thence all round the earth; for there was now a thought on the mind of Mr. Raikes, that was destined, in no long time, to make the whole world brighter than it had been hitherto."
"那个想法是什么呢？","And what was that thought?"
"我们必须要考虑到，雷克斯先生并非什么大富豪。英国有成千上万的人，上帝赐给他们的财富比雷克斯先生多很多，而且任何人都想得出，与雷克斯先生所能提供的帮助相比，他们也许能给同胞们带来更多的好处。还有国王、王子、贵族和政治家们，他们高高在上，被赋予了立法和执法的权力。如果要改善世界的状况，难道不该由这些人来完成吗？但是一个人能否行善并非取决于他的财富或地位，而在于他是否拥有一颗充满热情和智慧的爱心，一颗同情所有人类、把每个不幸的男人或女人视为兄弟姐妹、把每个被抛弃的孤儿当做自己的孩子的心。雷克斯先生就有这样一颗心。如今上帝赐予他一个机会，让他可以将更多的利益给予他的同胞，而这利益，对于谦卑的他来说，比梦想中的还要多。不客气地说，国王和他的贵族们，还有那些富有的英国绅士们，有无数的方法可用，但他们多年来没有做出任何值得让人感激铭记的事情，而如今这些事情要在一个卑微的人手里完成了。","It must be considered that Mr. Raikes was not a very rich man.There were thousands of people in England, to whom Providence had assigned greater wealth than he possessed, and who, as one would suppose, might have done far more good to their fellow-creatures than it lay in his power to do.There was a king, too, and princes, lords and statesmen, who were set in lofty places, and entrusted with the making and administration of the laws.If the condition of the world was to be improved, were not these the men to accomplish it?But the true faculty of doing good consists not in wealth nor station, but in the energy and wisdom of a loving heart, that can sympathize with all mankind, and acknowledges a brother or a sister in every unfortunate man or woman, and an own child in each neglected orphan.Such a heart was that of Mr. Raikes; and God now rewarded him with a blessed opportunity of conferring more benefit on his race, than he, in his humility, had ever dreamed of.And it would not be too much to say, that the king and his nobles, and the wealthy gentlemen of England, with all their boundless means, had for many years, done nothing so worthy of grateful remembrance, as what was now to be effected by this humble individual."
"然而，这个伟大的想法却是如此简单，而雷克斯先生也只用了很少的花费就将其付诸实践。这个想法只是在每个安息日聘请一些受人尊敬的有学识的妇女来这里给他所看到的那些在玩耍的可怜的孩子们上课，每人每次出一先令的薪水。也许在街上和雷克斯先生交谈的那位好心的妇女也是他新聘的女教师之一。尽管如此，这个计划还是成功了，并且引起了更多好心人的注意，很快在伦敦其他贫困街区传播开来。这就是主日学校的起源。随着时间的推移，类似的学校遍布那个大都市，并从那里推广到英国最偏远的地区，还跨洋传到了美洲，继而普及到世界各地，在这些地方，罗伯特·雷克斯，这个卑微的名字从未被人知晓。","And yet how simple was this great idea, and how small the means by which Mr. Raikes proceeded to put it in execution!It was merely, to hire respectable and intelligent women, at the rate of a shilling each, to come, every Sabbath, and keep little schools for the poor children whom he had seen at play.Perhaps the good woman with whom Mr. Raikes had spoken in the street, was one of his new school-mistresses.Be that as it might, the plan succeeded, and, attracting the notice of benevolent people, was soon adopted in many other dismal streets of London.And this was the origin of Sunday-schools.In course of time, similar schools were established all over that great city, and thence extended to the remotest parts of England, and across the ocean to America, and to countries at a world-wide distance, where the humble name of Robert Raikes had never been pronounced."
"如今那位好心人已经去世很久了。但是，每个安息日的早晨，不论城市还是乡村，只要在有教堂的塔尖直指云霄的地方，孩子们都会去上主日学校。成千上万的人在那里接受了教育，对他们来说，这比世界上所有的黄金都更珍贵。我们有理由相信，在天国，这套制度的缔造者安身的地方，他会时常碰见一群快乐的灵魂，他们尽情赞美他，因为是他把他们从人间的绝望、无知和邪恶中拯救出来，并引导他们步入天堂。这难道不是证据吗？当一个卑微的人并非刻意去做好事，所作所为只是简简单单地出于好心，那么上帝可能会用他那万能的双手接过这件好事并亲力而为吗？","That good man has now long been dead.But still, on every Sabbath-morning, in the cities and country villages, and wheresoever the steeple of a church points upward to the sky, the children take their way to the Sunday-school.Thousands, and tens of thousands, have there received instruction, which has been more profitable to them than all the gold on earth.And we may be permitted to believe, that, in the celestial world, where the founder of the system now exists, he has often met with other happy spirits, who have blessed him as the earthly means by which they were rescued from hopeless ignorance and evil, and guided on the path to Heaven.Is not this a proof; that when the humblest person acts in the simplicity of a pure heart, and with no design but to do good, God may be expected to take the matter into His all-powerful hands and adopt the action as His own?"
