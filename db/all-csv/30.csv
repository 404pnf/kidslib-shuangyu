"如果有人能在寻找大头针时却发现了一枚几尼，那毫无疑问，这个人必定是我的好朋友吉本教授。我曾听说过调查员有时会言过其实，但那可远远赶不上吉本。但不管怎么说，这一次，可以毫不夸张地讲，他的的确确发现了一种能彻底变革人类生活的东西。而他原本只是想寻找一种全能的刺激神经的药物，以使倦怠的人们在当今快节奏的生活压力下仍能应对自如。如今，我已多次尝试过这些药物，并且我能十分准确地描述出这些药物在我身上产生的效果。显而易见，对于那些想寻找新鲜感觉的人们来说，这类药物绝对能带给他们惊人的经历。","Certainly, if ever a man found a guinea when he was looking for a pin, it is my good friend Professor Gibberne.I have heard before of investigators overshooting the mark, but never quite to the extent that he has done.He has really, this time at any rate, without any touch of exaggeration in the phrase, found something to revolutionise human life.And that when he was simply seeking an all-round nervous stimulant to bring languid people up to the stresses of these pushful days.I have tasted the stuff now several times, and I cannot do better than describe the effect the thing had on me.That there are astonishing experiences in store for all in search of new sensations will become apparent enough."
"众所周知，吉本教授是我在福克斯通的邻居。如果我没记错的话，他各个时期的照片都曾被刊登在《斯特兰杂志》上——事后想想应该是在1899年的某一期上，不过我可没法考证了，因为我已经把那本杂志借给别人，而那人再也没还给我。也许读者们仍能回忆起他那高高的前额和不常见的又长又黑的眉毛，那容貌像极了德国神话里的魔鬼靡菲斯特，有些奸诈又有些神秘莫测。桑盖特北路有些小而舒适的独门独院的房子，吉本居住的就是其中一所。这种多样的建筑风格使路的西端充满生趣。吉本的那栋房子有着黄色硬砖的三角墙和摩尔式的门廊，那个有着直棂凸窗的小房间就是吉尔在这里时工作的地方。傍晚时分我们经常在那里一起抽烟、交谈。他是个搞笑大师，但除此之外，他也喜欢和我谈论他的工作。他是那种能在谈话中获得帮助和激励的人，因此从最开始我就对“新型加速剂”这个概念有所了解。当然，他的大部分实验都不是在福克斯通完成的，而是在高尔街。在那里吉尔有一个全新的实验室，就在医院附近，他是第一个使用此实验室的人。","Professor Gibberne, as many people know, is my neighbour in Folkestone.Unless my memory plays me a trick, his portrait at various ages has already appeared in The Strand Magazine—think late in 1899 but I am unable to look it up because I have lent that volume to someone who has never sent it back.The reader may, perhaps, recall the high forehead and the singularly long black eyebrows that give such a Mephistophelean touch to his face.He occupies one of those pleasant little detached houses in the mixed style that make the western end of the Upper Sandgate Road so interesting.His is the one with the Flemish gables and the Moorish portico, and it is in the little room with the mullioned bay window that he works when he is down here, and in which of an evening we have so often smoked and talked together.He is a mighty jester, but, besides, he likes to talk to me about his work; he is one of those men who find a help and stimulus in talking, and so I have been able to follow the conception of the New Accelerator right up from a very early stage.Of course, the greater portion of his experimental work is not done in Folkestone, but in Gower Street, in the fine new laboratory next to the hospital that he has been the first to use."
"每个人都知道，或者至少聪明的人都知道，吉本取得如此重大成就，并在生理学家之中享有盛名的特殊领域正是药物对神经系统的作用。据我所知，他在安眠药、镇静剂和麻醉剂方面的研究成绩无人能及。他还是一个相当杰出的化学家。我猜想，在他所研究的有关神经节细胞和核心纤维之谜这一诡秘而错综复杂的丛林中，很少有业已清理的小块空地被人知晓，也很少有什么启示公诸于世。要不是吉本看到了适当的时机，向世人公布他的研究成果，人们永远都不会知道他有哪些研究成果。在过去的几年里，他一直苦心钻研关于刺激神经的药物的问题，并且已经在发明“新型加速剂”之前，就在刺激神经类药物领域取得了重大进展。药物科学的发展应该感谢吉本取得的成绩，因为他已经研发出至少三种不同的且绝对安全的提神药。它们对辛勤工作的人们有着无与伦比的价值。我想，当人们感觉精疲力尽时，准备这种被称为“吉本B型糖浆”的药剂会比海边的救生艇挽救更多的生命。","As every one knows, or at least as all intelligent people know, the special department in which Gibberne has gained so great and deserved a reputation among physiologists is the action of drugs upon the nervous system.Upon soporifics, sedatives, and anaesthetics he is, I am told, unequalled.He is also a chemist of considerable eminence, and I suppose in the subtle and complex jungle of riddles that centres about the ganglion cell and the axis fibre there are little cleared places of his making, little glades of illumination, that, until he sees fit to publish his results, are still inaccessible to every other living man.And in the last few years he has been particularly assiduous upon this question of nervous stimulants, and already, before the discovery of the New Accelerator, very successful with them.Medical science has to thank him for at least three distinct and absolutely safe invigorators of unrivalled value to practising men.In cases of exhaustion the preparation known as Gibberne’s B Syrup has, I suppose, saved more lives already than any lifeboat round the coast."
"“但是这些药物中，几乎没有一种可以令我满意。”他在大约一年前对我如此说道，“它们或者能提高中心能量，而对神经没有影响，或者只能提高可获取能量，通过降低神经传导能力这种方式。所有这些药物只能产生不平衡的或者局部的效用。有的药物刺激了心脏和内脏，却使大脑神志不清；有的药物能使大脑异常活跃敏捷，却对腹腔神经丛毫无益处。而我想要的——哪怕只有一丁点的可能性，我想要的——是一种刺激性药物，能够刺激全身各处，能够使人从头顶到大脚趾尖都感受到刺激的药物，使人的运动节奏快于常人两倍——甚至三倍。嗯？那就是我一直寻找的东西。”","“But none of these little things begin to satisfy me yet,” he told me nearly a year ago.“Either they increase the central energy without affecting the nerves, or they simply increase the available energy by lowering the nervous conductivity; and all of them are unequal and local in their operation.One wakes up the heart and viscera and leaves the brain stupefied, one gets at the brain champagne fashion, and does nothing good for the solar plexus, and what I want—and what, if it’s an earthly possibility, I mean to have—is a stimulant that stimulates all round, that wakes you up for a time from the crown of your head to the tip of your great toe, and makes you go two—or even three—to everybody else’s one.Eh?That’s the thing I’m after.”"
"“它会把人们累垮的。”我说。","“It would tire a man,” I said."
"“这点不用担心。到时你的胃口也会增加两到三倍——就是这样。想想这意味着什么。试想你现在有这样一个小瓶，”——他举起了一个绿色的小玻璃瓶，并在上面指画着刻度——“在这个宝贵的小瓶里储存着这样一种能量，它能够使人们的思考速度、行动速度、工作效率在特定的时间内比以往提高一倍。”","“Not a doubt of it.And you’d eat double or treble—and all that.But just think what the thing would mean.Imagine yourself with a little phial like this”—he held up a little bottle of green glass and marked his points with it—“and in this precious phial is the power to think twice as fast, move twice as quickly, do twice as much work in a given time as you could otherwise do.”"
"“但这种事情可能发生吗？”","“But is such a thing possible?”"
"“我相信能发生。如果不能的话，我岂不是白白浪费了一年的时间。比如说，这些次磷酸盐的试剂其实就能显示出类似效果……尽管它只能达到常规速度的一点五倍。”","“I believe so.If it isn’t, I’ve wasted my time for a year.These various preparations of the hypophosphites, for example, seem to show that something of the sort... Even if it was only one and a half times as fast it would do.”"
"“能达到。”我说道。","“It would do,” I said."
"“比如说，假设你是一个走投无路的政治家，你的时间紧迫，却有很紧急重要的事情要处理，你怎么办？”","“If you were a statesman in a corner, for example, time rushing up against you, something urgent to be done, eh?”"
"“他可以求助于他的‘私人秘书’——服用此药。”我回答道。","“He could dose his private secretary,” I said."
"“那么他就赢得了——双倍时间。试想一下，比如你想要完成一本书。”","“And gain—double time.And think if you, for example, wanted to finish a book.”"
"“通常我会想，”我说，“要是我一开始就没动笔就好了。”","“Usually,” I said, “I wish I’d never begun ’em.”"
"“或者一位医生，忙得不可开交，却想要坐下来思考一个病例。又或者是一位律师——或者是一个需要突击应付考试的人。”","“Or a doctor, driven to death, wants to sit down and think out a case.Or a barrister—or a man cramming for an examination.”"
"我接话道：“对于这些人来讲，这一滴药水可就值一个几内亚啊。”","“Worth a guinea a drop,” said I, “and more—to men like that.”"
"“又比如说在一次决斗中，”吉本说道，“一切都取决于扣动扳机的速度。”","“And in a duel, again,” said Gibberne, “where it all depends on your quickness in pulling the trigger.”"
"“击剑比赛也是如此啊。”我回应道。","“Or in fencing,” I echoed."
"“你看吧，”吉本继续说道，“如果我能发明出这种万能药物，那真是对你一点害处也没有——当然，除了可能会使人稍微显得老一点以外。但你的寿命可就是其他人的两倍了啊——”","“You see,” said Gibberne, “if I get it as an all-round thing, it will really do you no harm at all—except perhaps to an infinitesimal degree it brings you nearer old age.You will just have lived twice to other people’s once—”"
"“我觉得，”我若有所思地说道，“这样做对决斗来讲——是不是有失公允啊？”","“I suppose,” I meditated, “in a duel—it would be fair?”"
"“那时只能考虑分秒必争。”吉本回应道。","“That’s a question for the seconds,” said Gibberne."
"我进一步回到原题。“你真的觉得这样的药剂能发明出来吗？”我问道。","I harked back further.“And you really think such a thing is possible?” I said."
"“能，”吉本向窗前一闪而过的东西瞅了一眼，说道，“就像公共汽车的发明一样，能实现。事实上——”","“As possible,” said Gibberne, and glanced at something that went throbbing by the window, “as a motor-bus.As a matter of fact—”"
"他停顿了一下，别有意味地对我笑了笑，然后用那个小绿药瓶缓慢地轻敲着书桌的边缘。“我想我了解那东西……我已经有些头绪了。”浮现在吉本脸上的那神经质的一笑透露出这件事在他心目中的重要地位。他只有在事情将近完成时才会谈论他的实验。“也许，我是说也许——我不会感到惊讶的——这个药的效力甚至可能是原来的两倍还不止。”","He paused and smiled at me deeply, and tapped slowly on the edge of his desk with the green phial.“I think I know the stuff... Already I’ve got something coming.”The nervous smile upon his face betrayed the gravity of his revelation.He rarely talked of his actual experimental work unless things were very near the end.“And it may be, it may be—I shouldn’t be surprised—it may even do the thing at a greater rate than twice.”"
"“那可就真是破天荒的大事件了。”我大胆预测。","“It will be rather a big thing,” I hazarded."
"“是的，我也觉得是破天荒的大事件。”","“It will be, I think, rather a big thing.”"
"但是我觉得，他当时其实并没有充分意识到那会是怎样一件破天荒的大事件。","But I don’t think he quite knew what a big thing it was to be, for all that."
"我记得我们后来又有过几次关于那种药物的谈话。他称那种药物为“新型加速剂”，而他的语气也变得一次比一次自信。有时候，他会忧心忡忡地谈及使用此药物可能会产生的一些无法预料的生理副作用，接着他会有些郁郁寡欢；又有些时候，他会急于获利，于是我们就会长久而又热切地讨论如何将这种药剂变为巨大的商业利益。“这是样好东西，”吉本说道，“是很棒的东西。我知道我是在给这个世界奉献着什么，所以期待世界能给我一些回报也是理所当然的。科学是高尚的，这话不假。但我觉得应该设法垄断这种药物，比方说，垄断十年。我不明白为什么生活中所有的乐趣都给了那些蹩脚的商人。”","I remember we had several talks about the stuff after that.“The New Accelerator” he called it, and his tone about it grew more confident on each occasion.Sometimes he talked nervously of unexpected physiological results its use might have, and then he would get a little unhappy; at others he was frankly mercenary, and we debated long and anxiously how the preparation might be turned to commercial account.“It’s a good thing,” said Gibberne, “a tremendous thing.I know I’m giving the world something, and I think it only reasonable we should expect the world to pay.The dignity of science is all very well, but I think somehow I must have the monopoly of the stuff for, say, ten years.I don’t see why all the fun in life should go to the dealers in ham.”"
"我对这种即将问世的药物的兴趣当然是有增无减。我对形而上学一直有些奇怪的曲解。我一直处于对时空的矛盾理解之中，所以对我而言，吉本正在调配的药剂只不过是生活本身的绝对加速度罢了。假如一个人反复地服用这种药剂，他确实将过着一种积极而又有意义的生活。但是，他会在十一岁就已经发育成一个成年人，二十五岁就步入中年，到三十岁就会开始走向衰老。在我看来，吉本现在为那些服药者所送上的，恰恰是大自然早已经赏赐给犹太人和东方人的东西。他们十几岁就已长大成人，五十岁时就已尽显老态，但在思维和行动上总要快于我们。我一直相信药物的伟大神奇功效：它可以使人发疯，也可以使人镇定；可以使人异常强壮敏捷，也可使人木讷迟滞；可以使人情绪高亢，也可使人麻木不仁。现在，医生手里的这个神奇的小药瓶又增添了一种新的奇异功效！但是吉本只热衷于技术层面的问题，而对于我考虑的这些问题，他是不会涉足太深的。","My own interest in the coming drug certainly did not wane in the time.I have always had a queer little twist towards metaphysics in my mind.I have always been given to paradoxes about space and time, and it seemed to me that Gibberne was really preparing no less than the absolute acceleration of life.Suppose a man repeatedly dosed with such a preparation: he would live an active and record life indeed, but he would be an adult at eleven, middle-aged at twenty-five, and by thirty well on the road to senile decay.It seemed to me that so far Gibberne was only going to do for any one who took his drug exactly what Nature has done for the Jews and Orientals, who are men in their teens and aged by fifty, and quicker in thought and act than we are all the time.The marvel of drugs has always been great to my mind; you can madden a man, calm a man, make him incredibly strong and alert or a helpless log, quicken this passion and allay that, all by means of drugs, and here was a new miracle to be added to this strange armoury of phials the doctors use!But Gibberne was far too eager upon his technical points to enter very keenly into my aspect of the question."
"那是8月7号或者8号吧，我们在一起聊天时，吉本告诉我，他正在进行蒸馏，成败与否就看蒸馏能否顺利进行了。10号那天，他告诉我大功已经告成，新型加速剂已经问世，成为现实。遇见吉本时，我正打算去桑盖特山上的福克斯通——我想我是要去理发的，而他恰好匆忙下山来见我——我猜他是来我家，要立即告诉我他成功的消息。我记得当时他双眼异常光亮，激动得满脸通红，甚至脚步也是异常矫健轻快。","It was the 7th or 8th of August when he told me the distillation that would decide his failure or success for a time was going forward as we talked, and it was on the 10th that he told me the thing was done and the New Accelerator a tangible reality in the world.I met him as I was going up the Sandgate Hill towards Folkestone—I think I was going to get my hair cut, and he came hurrying down to meet me—I suppose he was coming to my house to tell me at once of his success.I remember that his eyes were unusually bright and his face flushed, and I noted even then the swift alacrity of his step."
"“完成了，”他喊叫着，并一把握住我的手，急切地说，“大功告成了。快来我家看看。”","“It’s done,” he cried, and gripped my hand, speaking very fast; “it’s more than done.Come up to my house and see.”"
"“真的吗？”","“Really?”"
"“真的！”他喊道。“不可思议！快来看看。”","“Really!” he shouted.“Incredibly!Come up and see.”"
"“功效达到了——两倍？”","“And it does—twice?”"
"“不止两倍，远远超过两倍。它吓了我一跳。快跟我看看去。尝一尝！试一试！它是这世界上最神奇的东西！”他抓住我的胳膊，迈开大步向山上走去，迫使我不得不小跑。他一路还对我喊着些什么。一辆游览车上的所有人都转过身来，盯着我们看，好像在欣赏什么风景。那天天气炎热、晴朗，是福克斯通常见的天气。每种颜色在阳光的照耀下都显得极为鲜亮，每一条轮廓线都异常分明。虽然有微风，但我仍感到闷热、口干舌燥。我气喘吁吁，以博同情。","“It does more, much more.It scares me.Come up and see the stuff.Taste it!Try it!It’s the most amazing stuff on earth.”He gripped my arm and; walking at such a pace that he forced me into a trot, went shouting with me up the hill.A whole char-à-banc-ful of people turned and stared at us in unison after the manner of people in chars-à-banc.It was one of those hot, clear days that Folkestone sees so much of, every colour incredibly bright and every outline hard.There was a breeze, of course, but not so much breeze as sufficed under these conditions to keep me cool and dry.I panted for mercy."
"“我走得不快吧？”吉本大声说道，同时放缓了脚步，但仍像行军一样迅速。","“I’m not walking fast, am I?” cried Gibberne, and slackened his pace to a quick march."
"“你是不是已经喝了这种药啊？”我大口喘着气问道。","“You’ve been taking some of this stuff,” I puffed."
"“没有。”他回答说，“我只喝了一杯用来洗涤药物残留物的水。你知道，昨晚我是喝了一些。但已经过去很久了啊。”","“No,” he said.“At the utmost a drop of water that stood in a beaker from which I had washed out the last traces of the stuff.I took some last night, you know.But that is ancient history now.”"
"“功效是两倍吗？”我问道。到他家门口时我已经汗如雨下了。","“And it goes twice?” I said, nearing his doorway in a grateful perspiration."
"“效果是数千倍！”吉本答道，同时用一个极具戏剧性的姿势猛地推开了他那扇古老的门上有雕刻图样的栎树门。","“It goes a thousand times, many thousand times!” cried Gibberne, with a dramatic gesture, flinging open his Early English carved oak gate."
"我说了声“唷！”，然后跟着他走了进去。","“Phew!” said I, and followed him to the door."
"“我不知道功效到底有多少倍。”他说道，手里还拿着弹簧锁钥匙。","“I don’t know how many times it goes,” he said, with his latch-key in his hand."
"“那么你——”","“And you—”"
"“这将极大地丰富神经生理学的领域，并将视觉理论引入一个新纪元！……天知道究竟是几千倍。我们一会儿倒可以试一试——现在要做的事情就是试试这种药。”","“It throws all sorts of light on nervous physiology, it kicks the theory of vision into a perfectly new shape!...Heaven knows how many thousand times.We’ll try all that after—The thing is to try the stuff now.”"
"“试试这种药？”我重复道，此时我们正沿正走廊往前走。","“Try the stuff?” I said, as we went along the passage."
"“当然。”吉本站在他的书房里，转身对我说，“它就在那个绿色的小药瓶里！除非你害怕了？”","“Rather,” said Gibberne, turning on me in his study.“There it is in that little green phial there!Unless you happen to be afraid?”"
"我天性谨慎，只是在理论方面极富冒险精神。我当时确实有些害怕。但是另一方面，自尊心又在作祟。","I am a careful man by nature, and only theoretically adventurous.I was afraid.But on the other hand, there is pride."
"“好吧，”我讨价还价地说，“你是说你已经尝试过了？”","“Well,” I haggled.“You say you’ve tried it?”"
"“我试过了，”他说道，“我看起来并没因此而有什么不适，是吧？我甚至看起来脾气也不暴躁，而且我感觉——”","“I’ve tried it,” he said, “and I don’t look hurt by it, do I?I don’t even look livery, and I feel—”"
"我坐下来。“把药给我。”我说，“如果最坏的事情发生了，那就是不用去理发了，我觉得这是文明人最讨厌的一个义务。你是怎么服用这药的？”","I sat down.“Give me the potion,” I said.“If the worst comes to the worst it will save having my hair cut, and that, I think, is one of the most hateful duties of a civilised man.How do you take the mixture?”"
"“用水冲服。”吉本边说着边敲击着一个玻璃水瓶。","“With water,” said Gibberne, whacking down a carafe."
"他站立在他的桌前，注视着坐在他安乐椅里的我。他的举止突然受到了一位住在哈莱街的专科医生的影响。“你知道，这是古怪离奇的东西。”他说。","He stood up in front of his desk and regarded me in his easy-chair; his manner was suddenly affected by a touch of the Harley Street specialist.“It’s rum stuff, you know,” he said."
"我做了个手势。","I made a gesture with my hand."
"“我必须提醒你。首先，你一服完药就要闭上眼睛，差不多一分钟之后再特别小心地睁开。你仍能看得见东西。因为视觉只和振动的波长有关，和冲击的次数没有关系。但是如果当时眼睛是睁着的话，有一种对视网膜的冲击就会让人感到恶心、晕眩、意识模糊。所以，要把眼睛闭上。”","“I must warn you, in the first place, as soon as you’ve got it down to shut your eyes, and open them very cautiously in a minute or so’s time.One still sees.The sense of vision is a question of length of vibration, and not of multitude of impacts; but there’s a kind of shock to the retina, a nasty giddy confusion just at the time if the eyes are open.Keep ’em shut.”"
"“闭眼。”我重复着。“好的！”","“Shut,” I said.“Good!”"
"“接下来，保持不动。不要到处碰撞。如果你这样做的话，你可能会打破想拿的东西。要记住，你现在要比以往任何时候的速度都要快个几千倍，无论是心脏、肺部、肌肉还是大脑，全身上下都是如此——所以稍不留神就会伤得不轻。当然，你感觉不到。你的感觉就和现在没什么两样。只是世间的一切看起来都会比以往的速度放慢了几千倍。这就是药的神奇之处。”","“And the next thing is, keep still.Don’t begin to whack about.You may fetch something a nasty rap if you do.Remember you will be going several thousand times faster than you ever did before, heart, lungs, muscles, brain—everything—and you will hit hard without knowing it.You won’t know it, you know.You’ll feel just as you do now.Only everything in the world will seem to be going ever so many thousand times slower than it ever went before.That’s what makes it so deuced queer.”"
"“天啊！”我说，“你的意思是——”","“Lor,” I said.“And you mean—”"
"“你马上就会明白的。”他边说边拿起一个小量杯。他看了一眼桌上的材料。“玻璃杯，”他说道，“水，全在这儿。第一次尝试绝对不能服用太多。”","“You’ll see,” said he, and took up a little measure.He glanced at the material on his desk.“Glasses,” he said, “water.All here.Mustn’t take too much for the first attempt.”"
"那珍贵的药物从小药瓶里流了出来。“别忘了我告诉你的话。”他一边说一边把量杯里的药物倒进了一个玻璃杯，做出一副意大利服务员调威士忌的表情。“坐下，紧闭双眼，保持两分钟的绝对静止，”他接着说，“然后你会听到我说话。”","The little phial glucked out its precious contents.“Don’t forget what I told you,” he said, turning the contents of the measure into a glass in the manner of an Italian waiter measuring whisky.“Sit with the eyes tightly shut and in absolute stillness for two minutes,” he said.“Then you will hear me speak.”"
"他往装在每个杯子中的小剂量药物中分别添加了大约一英寸深的水。","He added an inch or so of water to the little dose in each glass."
"“顺便说一句，”他说，“不要放下玻璃杯。把它一直拿在手里，手放在膝盖上。对——就是这样。那么，现在——”","“By-the-by,” he said, “don’t put your glass down.Keep it in your hand and rest your hand on your knee.Yes—so.And now—”"
"他举起他的玻璃杯。","He raised his glass."
"“为新型加速剂干杯。”我说。","“The New Accelerator,” I said."
"“为新型加速剂干杯。”他响应道，我们碰杯之后，喝下了药物，我随即紧闭上双眼。","“The New Accelerator,” he answered, and we touched glasses and drank, and instantly I closed my eyes."
"你知道，当一个人吸入“毒气”后会产生一种茫然的虚无感。有那么一段时间我感觉就像那样。然后我听见吉本叫我睁开眼睛。于是，我动了动身体，睁开了双眼。他仍然站在原来站的地方，手里仍然拿着杯子。不同之处是，杯子是空的。","You know that blank non-existence into which one drops when one has taken “gas.”For an indefinite interval it was like that.Then I heard Gibberne telling me to wake up, and I stirred and opened my eyes.There he stood as he had been standing, glass still in hand.It was empty, that was all the difference."
"“嗯？”我说。","“Well?” said I."
"“没什么不对劲吧？”","“Nothing out of the way?”"
"“没有。或许稍微有一点兴奋的感觉。再就没什么其他的感觉了。”","“Nothing.A slight feeling of exhilaration, perhaps.Nothing more.”"
"“声音呢？”","“Sounds?”"
"“一切都是静止的。”我说，“天啊！是的！都静止了。只有一些微弱的拍打声，滴滴答答地响着，就像雨点落在不同事物上的声音。是什么声音？”","“Things are still,” I said.“By Jove!Yes!They are still.Except the sort of faint pat, patter, like rain falling on different things.What is it?”"
"“是被分解的声音。”我觉得吉本是这样回答我的，但我不是很确定。他瞥了窗户一眼。“你以前有没有看见过窗帘像这样固定在窗前？”","“Analysed sounds,” I think he said, but I am not sure.He glanced at the window.“Have you ever seen a curtain before a window fixed in that way before?”"
"循着他的目光，我看见窗帘的底端静止在空中，帘角高扬，好像正在微风中做着轻快拍打的动作。","I followed his eyes, and there was the end of the curtain, frozen, as it were, corner high, in the act of flapping briskly in the breeze."
"“没见过，”我回答道，“太神奇了吧。”","“No,” said I; “that’s odd.”"
"“看这里。”他说着，松开了拿着玻璃杯的那只手。我下意识地退开，等着看杯子打碎。但是它不但没摔碎，反而看起来甚至连动都没动。它悬在了半空中——一动不动。“大体来讲，”吉本说，“处在这个纬度上的物体是以每秒16英尺的速度降落的。这个杯子现在正以每秒16英尺的速度降落。只是，你现在看到的，还不到它降落的百分之一秒。这会让你对我的新型加速剂的速度有一些了解。”","“And here,” he said, and opened the hand that held the glass.Naturally I winced, expecting the glass to smash.But so far from smashing, it did not even seem to stir; it hung in mid-air—motionless.“Roughly speaking,” said Gibberne, “an object in these latitudes falls 16 feet in the first second.This glass is falling 16 feet in a second now.Only, you see, it hasn’t been falling yet for the hundredth part of a second.That gives you some idea of the pace of my Accelerator.”"
"他挥了挥手，在缓慢下沉的杯子上方和下方绕着圈地挥着。最后他抓住了杯底，向下拉，将杯子极其小心地放回到桌子上。“怎么样？”他一边说一边大笑起来。","And he waved his hand round and round, over and under the slowly sinking glass.Finally he took it by the bottom, pulled it down and placed it very carefully on the table.“Eh?” he said to me, and laughed."
"“看起来不错。”我回答着，开始极其小心谨慎地从椅子上站起来。我感觉非常好，非常轻快，还非常舒服，头脑中自信满满。我的全身各处都在超速运转。例如我的心脏每秒跳动一千次，可是我却一点也没感觉到不适。我望向窗外。一个不动的骑单车的人，低着头，车轮后面飞扬着凝固的尘土，正追赶着一辆静止的敞篷大马车。我盯着这不可思议的场景，惊得目瞪口呆。“吉本，”我叫嚷道，“这种混合药物药力能持续多久？”","“That seems all right,” I said, and began very gingerly to raise myself from my chair.I felt perfectly well, very light and comfortable, and quite confident in my mind.I was going fast all over.My heart, for example, was beating a thousand times a second, but that caused me no discomfort at all.I looked out of the window.An immovable cyclist, head down and with a frozen puff of dust behind his driving-wheel, scorched to overtake a galloping char-à-banc that did not stir.I gaped in amazement at this incredible spectacle.“Gibberne,” I cried, “how long will this confounded stuff last?”"
"“天知道！”他答道，“上次我服药之后就去睡觉了。告诉你吧，我当时也很害怕。我觉得它应该持续了几分钟吧——但感觉像有几个小时那么久。但是，不久之后药性就突然减弱了，这点我很确信。”","“Heaven knows!” he answered.“Last time I took it I went to bed and slept it off.I tell you, I was frightened.It must have lasted some minutes, I think—it seemed like hours.But after a bit it slows down rather suddenly, I believe.”"
"我发现自己并不害怕，觉得很自豪——我猜想可能是因为我们两人一起服药的缘故。“我们为什么不出去走走呢？”我问道。","I was proud to observe that I did not feel frightened—I suppose because there were two of us.“Why shouldn’t we go out?” I asked."
"“好的！”","“Why not?”"
"“他们会看到咱们吧。”","“They’ll see us.”"
"“不会。天哪，不可能！哦，因为我们现在的速度可要比最快速的戏法还要快上一千倍。走吧！从哪条路走呢？窗户，还是门？”","“Not they.Goodness, no!Why, we shall be going a thousand times faster than the quickest conjuring trick that was ever done.Come along!Which way shall we go?Window, or door?”"
"然后，我们从窗户出去了。","And out by the window we went."
"毫无疑问，在所有的经历中，无论是我曾经体验过的，或是自己幻想过的，还是从别人那里听说过的奇妙经历和幻想，那次我和吉本在新型加速剂的影响下，突然造访福克斯通里斯的经历是最奇特也最疯狂的一次。我们穿过他家的大门来到大街上，在那儿仔细观察了几分钟如雕像一般的来往交通。前面的敞篷大马车，除了车轮的顶部、几条马腿、马鞭的末端和那个正要打哈欠的售票员的下巴明显在动以外，在这辆缓慢行驶的运输工具上，其余的一切似乎都是静止不动的。除了一个人的喉咙里发出轻微的声音之外，一切都静悄悄的，没有声息。在这个似乎凝固了的宏伟建筑中，有一个车夫、一个售票员，还有11位乘客！我们绕着车四处观察，开始还觉得兴致勃勃、惊叹不已，到最后却觉得索然无味、不合心意了。他们就在那里，和我们相同，又和我们不同，被定格在各种漫不经心的姿态里。一个姑娘和一位男士相顾微笑，这轻佻的笑容似乎要永远持续下去；一位戴着软帽的女士手臂放在车栏杆上，好像永久地凝视着吉本的房子，眼睛一眨也不眨；一位男子摸着自己的胡须，像是一尊蜡像；另外一位则伸出僵直的手臂，手指分开，似乎要去抓自己松了的帽子。我们盯着这些人，我们朝他们大笑，我们朝他们做鬼脸，随后一种对他们的反感情绪向我们袭来，于是我们转身向那位赶往里斯的骑车人走去。","Assuredly of all the strange experiences that I have ever had, or imagined, or read of other people having or imagining, that little raid I made with Gibberne on the Folkestone Leas, under the influence of the New Accelerator, was the strangest and maddest of all.We went out by his gate into the road, and there we made a minute examination of the statuesque passing traffic.The tops of the wheels and some of the legs of the horses of this char-à-banc, the end of the whip-lash and the lower jaw of the conductor—who was just beginning to yawn—were perceptibly in motion, but all the rest of the lumbering conveyance seemed still.And quite noiseless except for a faint rattling that came from one man’s throat.And as parts of this frozen edifice there were a driver, you know, and a conductor, and eleven people!The effect as we walked about the thing began by being madly queer and ended by being—disagreeable.There they were, people like ourselves and yet not like ourselves, frozen in careless attitudes, caught in mid-gesture.A girl and a man smiled at one another, a leering smile that threatened to last for evermore; a woman in a floppy capelline rested her arm on the rail and stared at Gibberne’s house with the unwinking stare of eternity; a man stroked his moustache like a figure of wax, and another stretched a tiresome stiff hand with extended fingers towards his loosened hat.We stared at them, we laughed at them, we made faces at them, and then a sort of disgust of them came upon us, and we turned away and walked round in front of the cyclist towards the Leas."
"“天啊！”吉本突然嚷道，“快看那边！”","“Goodness!” cried Gibberne, suddenly; “ look there!”"
"他的手指向某处，顺着他手指的方向，我发现有一对翅膀异常缓慢地张合着，速度慢得像一只蠕动的蜗牛——但事实上却是一只蜜蜂。","He pointed, and there at the tip of his finger and sliding down the air with wings flapping slowly and at the speed of an exceptionally languid snail—was a bee."
"然后我们来到里斯。这里的景象似乎更疯狂。尽管乐队正在台上演奏，但是它发出的所有声音，在我们听来都是低音，像是人们的呼吸声，又像是一声延续了很长时间的叹息，有时又如一口庞大的钟发出的缓慢而沉闷的滴答声。被定住的人们笔直地站着，表情奇怪而又悄无声息，像是忸怩不自然的人体模型，抬着腿不稳定地做着跨步的动作，在草地上散步。我走近一条正跳跃在半空中的小狮子狗，观察它在落地时四肢的缓慢移动。“上帝啊，看这里！”吉本大声嚷道，我们停在了一位气宇非凡的人面前，他身穿白色淡条纹法兰绒上衣，脚穿白鞋，头戴巴拿马帽，正转身向他经过的两位衣着亮丽的女士眨眼。经过我们一番从容地审议之后，发现眨眼这件事没什么魅力可言。眨眼失去了调情的快乐，有人曾这样评论过，说人眨眼的时候眼睛其实并没有完全闭合，在低垂的眼睑下仍可以看到眼球的下边缘和一些眼白。“愿上帝提醒我，”我说，“我以后再也不想眨眼了。”","And so we came out upon the Leas.There the thing seemed madder than ever.The band was playing in the upper stand, though all the sound it made for us was a low-pitched, wheezy rattle, a sort of prolonged last sigh that passed at times into a sound like the slow, muffled ticking of some monstrous clock.Frozen people stood erect, strange, silent, self-conscious-looking dummies hung unstably in mid-stride, promenading upon the grass.I passed close to a little poodle dog suspended in the act of leaping, and watched the slow movement of his legs as he sank to earth.“Lord, look here!” cried Gibberne, and we halted for a moment before a magnificent person in white faint-striped flannels, white shoes, and a Panama hat, who turned back to wink at two gaily dressed ladies he had passed.A wink, studied with such leisurely deliberation as we could afford, is an unattractive thing.It loses any quality of alert gaiety, and one remarks that the winking eye does not completely close, that under its drooping lid appears the lower edge of an eyeball and a little line of white.“Heaven give me memory,” said I, “and I will never wink again.”"
"“也不想微笑了。”吉本接着说，因为他刚好看见一位女士微笑时呲牙咧嘴的表情。","“Or smile,” said Gibberne, with his eye on the lady’s answering teeth."
"“怎么搞的，真是热死了，”我说，“咱们慢点走吧。”","“It’s infernally hot, somehow,” said I, “Let’s go slower.”"
"“哎，快点走！”吉本说道。","“Oh, come along!” said Gibberne."
"我们在小路上轮椅间的缝隙中穿梭。许多坐在轮椅上的人姿态冷漠顺从，看起来几乎很自然。但是乐队队员们歪歪扭扭的鲜红色队服却不怎么素雅柔和。一个紫红色脸膛的矮个子绅士正努力迎着风打开报纸，这一动作也被定格了。有许多证据表明，有一阵较强的微风正吹拂着这些慢腾腾的人们，但我们却完全感觉不到风的存在。我们走出来，走出人群一小段距离后，又回过头去观察。只看见所有的人都静止得如同一幅画一样，他们好像突然之间受到了什么严厉的打击，变成了现实的蜡像，那种感觉一点也不美好。这一切当然很荒唐，但是我却莫名地感到狂喜，一种优越感油然而生。想想这是多么神奇啊！自从药物在我的身体里开始有反应后，我所说的、所想的、所做的，这一切对于那些人、对于整个世界来说，只不过是眨眼之间而已。“新型加速剂——”我刚一开口，就被吉本打断了。","We picked our way among the bath-chairs in the path.Many of the people sitting in the chairs seemed almost natural in their passive poses, but the contorted scarlet of the bandsmen was not a restful thing to see.A purple-faced little gentleman was frozen in the midst of a violent struggle to refold his newspaper against the wind; there were many evidences that all these people in their sluggish way were exposed to a considerable breeze, a breeze that had no existence so far as our sensations went.We came out and walked a little way from the crowd, and turned and regarded it.To see all that multitude changed to a picture, smitten rigid, as it were, into the semblance of realistic wax, was impossibly wonderful.It was absurd, of course; but it filled me with an irrational, an exultant sense of superior advantage.Consider the wonder of it!All that I had said, and thought, and done since the stuff had begun to work in my veins had happened, so far as those people, so far as the world in general went, in the twinkling of an eye.“The New Accelerator—” I began, but Gibberne interrupted me."
"“又是那个讨厌的老女人！”他说道。","“There’s that infernal old woman!” he said."
"“什么老女人？”","“What old woman?”"
"“就是住在我隔壁的那个，”吉本回答，“她那只卷毛狗总是瞎叫唤。天啊！这诱惑太强烈了！”","“Lives next door to me,” said Gibberne.“Has a lapdog that yaps.Gods!The temptation is strong!”"
"吉本有时很幼稚，很冲动。在我规劝他之前，他已经冲上前去，以常人无法看见的速度抓住了那只不幸的小狗，拼命向里斯山的悬崖奔去。这简直太不不可思议了。那个小畜生，你知道，既不叫也不动，看不出有一丝生命的迹象。它就那样保持着相当僵硬的姿态，像被催眠了一样，任由吉本抓着它的脖子。好像吉本是在提着一只木头狗在跑似的。“吉本，”我喊道，“快把它放下！”然后，我又喊道：“如果你再那么跑下去的话，吉本，”我叫道，“你的衣服会着火的。你的亚麻布裤子快烤焦成褐色了！”","There is something very boyish and impulsive about Gibberne at times.Before I could expostulate with him he had dashed forward, snatched the unfortunate animal out of visible existence, and was running violently with it towards the cliff of the Leas.It was most extraordinary.The little brute, you know, didn’t bark or wriggle or make the slightest sign of vitality.It kept quite stiffly in an attitude of somnolent repose, and Gibberne held it by the neck.It was like running about with a dog of wood.“Gibberne,” I cried, “put it down!”Then I said something else.“If you run like that, Gibberne,” I cried, “you’ll set your clothes on fire.Your linen trousers are going brown as it is!”"
"他用手拍打着大腿，站在悬崖边上迟疑着。“吉本，”我边喊边追了上去，“快把它放下。真是太热了！都是因为我们一直在奔跑！每秒二到三英里哪！与空气产生了摩擦！”","He clapped his hand on his thigh and stood hesitating on the verge.“Gibberne,” I cried, coming up, “put it down.This heat is too much!It’s our running so!Two or three miles a second!Friction of the air!”"
"“你说什么？”他说着，瞟了小狗一眼。","“What?” he said, glancing at the dog."
"“与空气产生摩擦了，”我嚷道，“与空气产生摩擦了。跑得太快了，像陨石之类的一样。热得要命啊。我说，吉本！吉本！我浑身都痛，汗流浃背的。你看，那些人开始略微动起来了。我想药性快过了！把小狗放下吧。”","“Friction of the air,” I shouted.“Friction of the air.Going too fast.Like meteorites and things.Too hot.And, Gibberne!Gibberne!I’m all over pricking and a sort of perspiration.You can see people stirring slightly.I believe the stuff’s working off!Put that dog down.”"
"“嗯？”他说。","“Eh?” he said."
"“药性要过了。”我重复道，“我们太热了，而且药性也快过了！我全身都湿透了。”","“It’s working off,” I repeated.“We’re too hot and the stuff’s working off!I’m wet through.”"
"他盯着我看，然后望向那边的乐队，先前微弱的演奏声明显快了起来。突然，吉本将手臂用力一甩，将小狗仍了出去，那小狗旋转着向上飞，依然没有气息似的，最后悬在一堆阳伞上，伞底下有一大群人在交谈。吉本一把抓住我的胳膊肘。“天啊！”他喊道，“我觉得是这样！我也感到浑身灼痛——是啊。那个人正在抖动手帕！看见了。我们必须赶紧离开。”","He stared at me, then at the band, the wheezy rattle of whose performance was certainly going faster.Then with a tremendous sweep of the arm he hurled the dog away from him and it went spinning upward, still inanimate, and hung at last over the grouped parasols of a knot of chattering people.Gibberne was gripping my elbow.“By Jove!” he cried, “I believe it is!A sort of hot pricking and—yes.That man’s moving his pocket-handkerchief!Perceptibly.We must get out of this sharp.”"
"但是我们没办法离开得特别快。也许这反倒是一种幸运！因为我们可能会再跑，而如果我们跑下去，我们身上肯定就着火了。我们本该身上着火的，这几乎是必然的！你知道我们谁也没想到这一点……但是我们还没开始跑，药性已经过了。这只不过是一瞬间的事情。新型加速剂的效力在挥手间便消失殆尽了，就好像窗帘被一下子拉开了一样。我听到吉本的声音极为惊慌。“坐下吧。”他说，然后就重重地坐在里斯山悬崖边的草地上——我坐下的时候，草变焦了。现在，在我坐过的地方还留有烧焦的草皮的痕迹。停滞的一切似乎像我一样苏醒过来，乐队发出的脱节的振动声也瞬间汇成了一片响亮的音乐。散步的人们，脚落回地面，开始正常行走。报纸和旗子开始飘动，微笑变成了交谈，眨眼的人完成了眨眼的动作，继续沾沾自喜地前行。所有坐着的人们也开始动了起来，交谈着。","But we could not get out of it sharply enough.Luckily, perhaps!For we might have run, and if we had run we should, I believe, have burst into flames.Almost certainly we should have burst into flames!You konw we had neither of us thought of that...But before we could even begin to run the action of the drug had ceased.It was the business of a minute fraction of a second.The effect of the New Accelerator passed like the drawing of a curtain, vanished in the movement of a hand.I heard Gibberne’s voice in infinite alarm.“Sit down,” he said, and flop, down upon the turf at the edge of the Leas I sat—scorching as I sat.There is a patch of burnt grass there still where I sat down.The whole stagnation seemed to wake up as I did so, the disarticulated vibration of the band rushed together into a blast of music, the promenaders put their feet down and walked their ways, the papers and flags began flapping, smiles passed into words, the winker finished his wink and went on his way complacently, and all the seated people moved and spoke."
"整个世界又恢复了生机，和我们以同样的速度运转着，或者说，是我们的节奏不再比世间其他事物快了。就好像是一辆进站的火车会减速一样。每一件东西都好像旋转了一两秒，我感到一阵极恶心的感觉，但转瞬即逝，仅此而已。至于那只小狗，似乎只是在吉本甩出胳膊时在空中停留了半刻，便穿过一位女士的阳伞，在加速度作用下迅速地摔落在地。","The whole world had come alive again, was going as fast as we were, or rather we were going no faster than the rest of the world.It was like slowing down as one comes into a railway station.Everything seemed to spin round for a second or two, I had the most transient feeling of nausea, and that was all.And the little dog, which had seemed to hang for a moment when the force of Gibberne’s arm was expended, fell with a swift acceleration clean through a lady’s parasol!"
"这可救了我们。只有一位坐在轮椅上的胖胖的老先生确实一开始就看到了我们，然后又时不时暗中用怀疑的目光打量我们。最后，我相信，他还对他旁边的护士说了些什么。除此之外，我怀疑是否还有哪个人注意到我们突然出现在他们中间。扑通！我们一定出现得很突然。我们几乎是立刻就停止了燃烧，尽管屁股下面的草皮还是很烫，让人难受。当时每个人的注意力——甚至包括那个娱乐协会的乐队，他们有史以来头一次在这种场合跑了调——都被这惊人的事实和由此引起的惊人的叫嚷和喧嚣所吸引。一只体面的、喂得过肥的小狗，原本安静地躺在演奏台的东面睡觉，现在竟突然从位于西面的一位女士的阳伞上落下来——身上还留有因在空中疾速飞驰而留下的有点烧焦的痕迹。在那个荒谬的年代，我们也都试着尽可能变得通灵、愚蠢和迷信！人们都纷纷站起，相互踩踏，椅子被撞得东倒西歪，里斯的警察们也跑掉了。然而，这件事情最终人们是如何解释的我们就不得而知了——因为我们当时正急于从这个事件以及那位坐在轮椅上的老先生的目光中逃离，根本没时间去打听。等身体充分冷却了下来，头脑也从眩晕、恶心和混乱中完全恢复过来时，我们立刻站起身，沿着曼彻坡下面的小路径直向吉本的房子走去。但是在一片吵闹声中，我清楚地听到那位一直坐在那位阳伞破了的女士旁边的一位绅士，用无理的恐吓语言质问其中一位帽子上印着“巡视员”字样的护理人员，说：“如果不是你扔的狗，那会是谁干的？”","That was the saving of us.Unless it was for one corpulent old gentleman in a bath-chair, who certainly did start at the sight of us, and afterwards regarded us at intervals with a darkly suspicious eye, and, finally, I believe, said something to his nurse about us, I doubt if a solitary person remarked our sudden appearance among them.Plop!We must have appeared abruptly.We ceased to smoulder almost at once, though the turf beneath me was uncomfortably hot.The attention of every one—including even the Amusements’ Association band, which on this occasion, for the only time in its history, got out of tune—was arrested by the amazing fact, and the still more amazing yapping and uproar caused by the fact, that a respectable, over-fed lapdog sleeping quietly to the east of the bandstand should suddenly fall through the parasol of a lady on the west—in a slightly singed condition due to the extreme velocity of its movements through the air.In these absurd days, too, when we are all trying to be as psychic, and silly, and superstitious as possible!People got up and trod on other people, chairs were overturned, the Leas policeman ran.How the matter settled itself I do not know—we were much too anxious to disentangle ourselves from the affair and get out of range of the eye of the old gentleman in the bath-chair to make minute inquiries.As soon as we were sufficiently cool and sufficiently recovered from our giddiness and nausea and confusion of mind to do so we stood up, and skirting the crowd, directed our steps back along the road below the Metropole towards Gibberne’s house.But amidst the din I heard very distinctly the gentleman who had been sitting beside the lady of the ruptured sunshade using quite unjustifiable threats and language to one of those chair-attendants who have “Inspector” written on their caps: “If you didn’t throw the dog,” he said, “who did?”"
"事物的运动和熟悉的噪音都突然恢复正常，再加上我们自己也失魂落魄(我们的衣服仍然烫得要命，吉本那条白裤子的大腿部位已是一片焦黄)，阻止了我们想要仔细观察这一切的念头。事实上，在回去的路上，我没有做任何有科学价值的研究。蜜蜂自然早飞走了。我试图寻找那位骑车人，但是等我们回到桑盖特路上时，那个人也早已不见了踪影，或许是藏身于我们看不见的车流之中了吧。不过，那辆敞篷大马车正载着精神饱满、活蹦乱跳的人们，以轻快的步伐疾驰，就快到附近的那座教堂了。","The sudden return of movement and familiar noises, and our natural anxiety about ourselves (our clothes were still dreadfully hot, and the fronts of the thighs of Gibberne’s white trousers were scorched a drabbish brown), prevented the minute observations I should have liked to make on all these things.Indeed, I really made no observations of any scientific value on that return.The bee, of course, had gone.I looked for that cyclist, but he was already out of sight as we came into the Upper Sandgate Road or hidden from us by traffic; the char-à-banc, however, with its people now all alive and stirring, was clattering along at a spanking pace almost abreast of the nearer church."
"然而，我们注意到，当时出去时踩过的窗台上仍留有烧焦的痕迹，而留在鹅卵石上的脚印也异常之深。","We noted, however, that the window-sill on which we had stepped in getting out of the house was slightly singed, and that the impressions of our feet on the gravel of the path were unusually deep."
"这就是我第一次使用新型加速剂时的经历。实际上，我们那时四处奔跑，所言所行都是在一秒钟左右的时间内完成的。我们度过了半个小时，但乐队或许只演奏了两小节而已吧。但是它在我们身上产生的药效却是让世间的一切都停滞了下来，供我们就近观察。细想想这一切，尤其是想到我们冲动地跑出房子，这次经历原本有可能会比实际发生的更让人不快。毫无疑问，事实表明如果吉本想要使这种药物成为可控制的药剂，还需要作进一步的研究，但是它的可行性则是经得住论证，无可指摘的。","So it was I had my first experience of the New Accelerator.Practically we had been running about and saying and doing all sorts of things in the space of a second or so of time.We had lived half an hour while the band had played, perhaps, two bars.But the effect it had upon us was that the whole world had stopped for our convenient inspection.Considering all things, and particularly considering our rashness in venturing out of the house, the experience might certainly have been much more disagreeable than it was.It showed, no doubt, that Gibberne has still much to learn before his preparation is a manageable convenience, but its practicability it certainly demonstrated beyond all cavil."
"自从那次历险之后，吉本一直都在研究如何能让这类药物受人控制。我在他的指导下，又服用过几次这种药，没什么副作用。但是我得承认，在药性没过时，我再也没有跑出去过。比如说，我提一下，我的这篇小说除中间吃了些巧克力外是一气呵成的，没有受到什么干扰。我是六点二十五分开始动笔的，现在我的手表差不多指向半点了。如果我们能确保在被约会充斥的一天中，有那么一段时间可以免受打扰，专心从事自己的工作，那么这其中的自在愉悦真是再夸大也不为过了。吉本现在正在研究药物的剂量掌控，因为要考虑不同体质的人服用之后会产生哪些不同的效果。他还希望能发现一种减速剂，可以降低加速剂现在的超强药效。减速剂当然是与加速剂的作用完全相反的。单独使用时，可以使服用者感觉平常的几个小时会像几秒钟一样转瞬即逝，使人们能够在精神亢奋或情绪激动时镇定下来，从容淡定。这两种药物的同时问世，一定会给人类文明带来一场彻底的变革。这将会成为我们摆脱卡莱尔曾说过的“时间外衣束缚”的开始。加速剂能使我们集中注意力，全身心投入到那些要求极大精力和热情的事情上；减速剂能使我们平心静气地度过无聊郁闷的时光。也许我对减速剂有些乐观，因为毕竟它还没有被开发出来，但是关于加速剂就没什么好置疑的了。几个月之后，它就会以方便、可控、易服的形式问世。药商和药剂师们能随时随地买到这种绿色小瓶里的药剂。虽然价格贵了些，但它的确有不寻常的作用，物有所值。吉本的所谓“神经加速剂”有望以三种不同药效投放市场：200倍的、900倍的和2000倍的，并会被分别贴上黄色、粉色和白色的标签以示区别。","Since that adventure he has been steadily bringing its use under control, and I have several times, and without the slightest bad result, taken measured doses under his direction; though I must confess I have not yet ventured abroad again while under its influence.I may mention, for example, that this story has been written at one sitting and without interruption, except for the nibbling of some chocolate, by its means.I began at 6.25, and my watch is now very nearly at the minute past the half-hour.The convenience of securing a long, uninterrupted spell of work in the midst of a day full of engagements cannot be exaggerated.Gibberne is now working at the quantitative handling of his preparation, with especial reference to its distinctive effects upon different types of constitution.He then hopes to find a Retarder, with which to dilute its present rather excessive potency.The Retarder will, of course, have the reverse effect to the Accelerator; used alone it should enable the patient to spread a few seconds over many hours of ordinary time, and so to maintain an apathetic inaction, a glacier-like absence of alacrity, amidst the most animated or irritating surroundings.The two things together must necessarily work an entire revolution in civilised existence.It is the beginning of our escape from that Time Garment of which Carlyle speaks.While this Accelerator will enable us to concentrate ourselves with tremendous impact upon any moment or occasion that demands our utmost sense and vigour, the Retarder will enable us to pass in passive tranquillity through infinite hardship and tedium.Perhaps I am a little optimistic about the Retarder, which has indeed still to be discovered, but about the Accelerator there is no possible sort of doubt whatever.Its appearance upon the market in a convenient, controllable, and assimilable form is a matter of the next few months.It will be obtainable of all chemists and druggists, in small green bottles, at a high but, considering its extraordinary qualities, by no means excessive price.Gibberne’s Nervous Accelerator it will be called, and he hopes to be able to supply it in three strengths: one in 200, one in 900, and one in 2000, distinguished by yellow, pink, and white labels respectively."
"毫无疑问，它的投放使用会带来一系列的神奇效果。当然，其中最令人瞩目的应该是对时间间隙的利用，也许，连犯罪分子也会利用这种功效以逃脱法律的制裁。像所有其他强效的药物制剂一样，它极有可能被滥用。然而，我们已细致讨论了这方面的问题，并认为这个问题纯粹是法医学的事，超出了我们的职权范围。我们将会批量生产和出售这种加速剂，至于结果如何——就请大家拭目以待吧。","No doubt its use renders a great number of very extraordinary things possible; for, of course, the most remarkable and, possibly, even criminal proceedings may be effected with impunity by thus dodging, as it were, into the interstices of time.Like all potent preparations, it will be liable to abuse.We have, however, discussed this aspect of the question very thoroughly, and we have decided that this is purely a matter of medical jurisprudence and altogether outside our province.We shall manufacture and sell the Accelerator, and as for the consequences—we shall see."
