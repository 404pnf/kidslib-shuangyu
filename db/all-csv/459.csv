"狐狸把戏","Fox in the Morning"
"作者：欧·亨利","by O. Henry"
"科拉里奥横卧在正午的热浪中，像个美人百无聊赖地躺在被人看守着的深闺里。这个小镇坐落在一片狭长的冲积海岸上。它就像一颗小小的珍珠，镶在翡翠带上。小镇背后，是沿海岸线延伸的科迪勒拉山系，它巍峨高耸，气势逼人，仿佛要把小镇压在底下似的。小镇前面，大海铺展开来，看上去像个笑容满面的狱卒，却比那些眉头紧锁的大山更加难以对付。波浪拍打着光滑的海滩，发出哗哗的响声；鹦鹉在橘树和吉贝树上尖声歌唱；棕榈树傻乎乎地挥动着他们柔软的叶子，就像在歌剧女主角暗示下进场的笨拙的合唱队。","Coralio reclined, in the mid-day heat, like some vacuous beauty lounging in a guarded harem.The town lay at the sea’s edge on a strip of alluvial coast.It was set like a little pearl in an emerald band.Behind it, and seeming almost to topple, imminent, above it, rose the sea-following range of the Cordilleras.In front the sea was spread, a smiling jailer, but even more incorruptible than the frowning mountains.The waves swished along the smooth beach; the parrots screamed in the orange and ceiba-trees; the palms waved their limber fronds foolishly like an awkward chorus at the prima donna’s cue to enter."
"突然，小镇骚动起来了。一个本地的男孩一边沿着杂草丛生的街道飞奔，一边尖声喊道：“叫古德温先生。他有封电报！”","Suddenly the town was full of excitement.A native boy dashed down a grass-grown street, shrieking: “Busca el Señor Goodwin.Ha venido un telégrafo por él!”"
"这话很快传开了。在科拉里奥，很少有人收到电报。男孩的呼唤声被一群好事者的吵吵声淹没了。与海滩平行的主街挤满了人，大家都恨不得看到电报快点送达。一群群妇女，肤色从黄褐到深棕深浅各异，都聚集在街道角落里，唉声叹道：“一封发给古德温先生的电报！”对执政党忠心耿耿的指挥官恩卡纳西翁·里奥斯先生怀疑古德温拥护在野党；他“啊哈”了一声，在他的秘密备忘录上记下了这个事实，即古德温先生在那个重大的日子里收到了一封电报，作为将来指控的证据。　","The word passed quickly.Telegrams do not often come to anyone in Coralio.The cry for Se?or Goodwin was taken up by a dozen officious voices.The main street running parallel to the beach became populated with those who desired to expedite the delivery of the despatch.Knots of women with complexions varying from palest olive to deepest brown gathered at street corners and plaintively carolled: “Un telegrama por Señor Goodwin!”The comandante, Don Señor el Coronel Encarnación Rios, who was loyal to the Ins and suspected Goodwin’s devotion to the Outs, hissed: “Aha!” and wrote in his secret memorandum book the accusive fact that Se?or Goodwin had on that momentous date received a telegram."
"在喧闹声中，一个男人出现在一座小木屋的门口，向外看了看。小木屋门上有块牌子，上面写着“基奥—克兰西”，在这片热带国度里，这名字听起来颇有点异国风味。门口的这个人叫比利·基奥，这些年来一直在美洲大陆加勒比海沿岸游荡，寻找发迹的机会。铁版照相和相片是当时“基奥—克兰西”打入各个海岸的武器，而那些地方的居民对这些新奇事物总是毫无抵抗力。商店外有两个大相框，里面装满了代表他们照相技艺的样片。","In the midst of the hullabaloo a man stepped to the door of a small wooden building and looked out.Above the door was a sign that read “Keogh and Clancy”—a nomenclature that seemed not to be indigenous to that tropical soil.The man in the door was Billy Keogh, scout of fortune and progress and latter-day rover of the Spanish Main.Tintypes and photographs were the weapons with which Keogh and Clancy were at that time assailing the hopeless shores.Outside the shop were set two large frames filled with specimens of their art and skill."
"基奥斜倚在门道里，他天生一副滑稽面容，五官棱角分明，看样子对街上难得的生机与喧闹颇感兴趣。弄清楚骚动的起因后，他把一只手放到嘴边当话筒，喊道：“嘿！弗兰克！”他那粗野的声音盖过了当地人的窃窃私语，四周变得安静了。","Keogh leaned in the doorway, his bold and humorous countenance wearing a look of interest at the unusual influx of life and sound into the street.When the meaning of the disturbance became clear to him he placed a hand beside his mouth and shouted: “Hey!Frank!” in such a robustious voice that the feeble clamour of the natives was drowned and silenced."
"五十码外，在街道靠海的那边，是美国领事的住所。听到喊声，古德温急匆匆地从这栋建筑的大门里跑出来。他刚才正和威拉德·格迪领事一起在领事馆的后门廊里抽烟，那儿被公认为科拉里奥最凉爽的地方。","Fifty yards away, on the seaward side of the street, stood the abode of the consul for the United States.Out from the door of this building tumbled Goodwin at the call.He had been smoking with Willard Geddie, the consul, on the back porch of the consulate, which was conceded to be the coolest spot in Coralio."
"“快过来。”基奥叫道，就因为给你的一封电报，镇上乱起来了。对这类事情你得小心，我的伙计。这样玩弄公众的感情可不行。有一天你会变成带有保守成分的左派分子；到那时这个国家将陷入革命的动荡之中。”","“Hurry up,” shouted Keogh.“There’s a riot in town on account of a telegram that’s come for you.You want to be careful about these things, my boy.It won’t do to trifle with the feelings of the public this way.You’ll be getting a pink note some day with violet scent on it; and then the country’ll be steeped in the throes of a revolution.”"
"古德温沿着街道往前走，碰上了送信的那个男孩。长着大眼睛的女人们既害羞又钦慕地注视着他，因为这样的男人对她们很有吸引力。他身材魁梧，皮肤白皙，金发碧眼，身上穿着白色亚麻衣服，脚上是鹿皮鞋子，显得很活泼。他彬彬有礼，举手投足间略带粗野之气，但眼神中不乏和善与仁慈。电报递交完，送信人领过赏钱走开，人们便放心地回到了附近的阴凉处——刚才，好奇心曾驱使着他们从那里走出去——女人们回到橘树底下，在泥炉子上烤东西，或是没完没了地梳她们又长又直的头发；男人们则回到小酒馆抽烟闲谈。","Goodwin had strolled up the street and met the boy with the message.The ox-eyed women gazed at him with shy admiration, for his type drew them.He was big, blonde, and jauntily dressed in white linen, with buckskin zapatos.His manner was courtly, with a sort of kindly truculence in it, tempered by a merciful eye.When the telegram had been delivered, and the bearer of it dismissed with a gratuity, the relieved populace returned to the contiguities of shade from which curiosity had drawn it—the women to their baking in the mud ovens under the orange-trees, or to the interminable combing of their long, straight hair; the men to their cigarettes and gossip in the cantinas."
"古德温坐在基奥门前的台阶上，读他的电报。电报是一个叫鲍勃·恩格尔哈特的美国人发来的，他住在安楚里亚的首都圣马特奥，八十英里外的一座内陆城市。恩格尔哈特是一个金矿工人，一个狂热的革命分子，一个“好人”。他也是个足智多谋、想象力丰富的人，这从他发的电报中可以得到证明。他的任务是把一份秘密情报传达给他在科拉里奥的朋友。这情报本不能用西班牙语或英语来写，因为安楚里亚的政治眼线很活跃。执政党和在野党时时刻刻都保持着警惕。但恩格尔哈特可称得上是个外交家。只有一种密码能够保证情报的安全，这就是强大的俚语密码。于是，这封未被破译的情报就这样从挑剔的官员们指间溜掉，来到了古德温面前。","Goodwin sat on Keogh’s doorstep, and read his telegram.It was from Bob Englehart, an American, who lived in San Mateo, the capital city of Anchuria, eighty miles in the interior.Englehart was a gold miner, an ardent revolutionist and “good people.”That he was a man of resource and imagination was proven by the telegram he had sent.It had been his task to send a confidential message to his friend in Coralio.This could not have been accomplished in either Spanish or English, for the eye politic in Anchuria was an active one.The Ins and the Outs were perpetually on their guard.But Englehart was a diplomatist.There existed but one code upon which he might make requisition with promise of safety—the great and potent code of Slang.So, here is the message that slipped, unconstrued, through the fingers of curious officials, and came to the eye of Goodwin:"
"“自命不凡的人带着东拼西凑的款子和他所痴迷的那捆平纹细布沿着长耳大野兔路线逃窜了。那笔款子有六位数。我们的队伍完好无损，但需要票子。你去弄吧。那个大家伙带着干货奔海边去了。你知道该做什么。鲍勃。”","“His Nibs skedaddled yesterday per jack-rabbit line with all the coin in the kitty and the bundle of muslin he’s spoony about.The boodle is six figures short.Our crowd in good shape, but we need the spondulicks.You collar it.The main guy and the dry goods are headed for the briny.You know what to do.BOB. “"
"这冗长的电文看上去十分古怪，对古德温来说却一点儿也不神秘。在最先进驻安楚里亚的那群工于心计的美国人当中，古德温是最成功的一个。一旦他的权力达到令人妒忌的顶峰，他就能充分发挥他预见与推理的才华。他已经把政治阴谋当成了一桩生意。他很精明，足以对处于领导地位的阴谋家施加一定的影响；他又有经济实力，足以买到小职员的尊敬。革命党总是有的；他也总是与之结盟，因为新政权的追随者只要效力就会获得奖赏。现在就有一个自由党试图推翻米拉弗洛尔总统。如果革命的车轮能够顺利运转，内陆地区最好的三万曼札纳咖啡园就会稳稳落入古德温手中。近来，米拉弗洛尔总统仕途上的一些变故使得精明的古德温起了疑心；他怀疑政府即将解体，但不是因为革命，而是另有原因。现在，恩格尔哈特的电报证明了古德温的睿智。","This screed, remarkable as it was, had no mystery for Goodwin.He was the most successful of the small advance-guard of speculative Americans that had invaded Anchuria, and he had not reached that enviable pinnacle without having well exercised the arts of foresight and deduction.He had taken up political intrigue as a matter of business.He was acute enough to wield a certain influence among the leading schemers, and he was prosperous enough to be able to purchase the respect of the petty office-holders.There was always a revolutionary party; and to it he had always allied himself; for the adherents of a new administration received the rewards of their labours.There was now a Liberal party seeking to overturn President Miraflores.If the wheel successfully revolved, Goodwin stood to win a concession to 30,000 manzanas of the finest coffee lands in the interior.Certain incidents in the recent career of President Miraflores had excited a shrewd suspicion in Goodwin’s mind that the government was near a dissolution from another cause than that of a revolution, and now Englehart’s telegram had come as a corroboration of his wisdom."
"安楚里亚的语言学家曾用西班牙语知识和基础的英语知识研读这封电报，却根本读不懂；但它却向古德温传达了一条振奋人心的消息。电报上说，共和国总统带着国库中的所有钱款，从首都逃跑了。同他一起逃走的还有那位迷人的女冒险家、歌剧演员伊莎贝尔·吉伯特。她的剧团上个月在圣马特奥受到总统的款待，那场面比招待皇室来访者还隆重。电文中的“长耳大野兔路线”指的正是科拉里奥与首都之间的那条主要靠骡子运输的通道。那笔“款子”只有“六位数”，暗示出这个国家窘迫的财政状况。还有一个令人信服的事实，就是即将上台的政党——它现在将以和平的方式接管政府——需要“票子”。除非允诺得以兑现，战利品被胜者分享，否则，新政府的地位将极不稳固。因此，急需“抓住那个大家伙”，把军费和政府开支要回来。","The telegram, which had remained unintelligible to the Anchurian linguists who had applied to it in vain their knowledge of Spanish and elemental English, conveyed a stimulating piece of news to Goodwin’s understanding.It informed him that the president of the republic had decamped from the capital city with the contents of the treasury.Furthermore, that he was accompanied in his flight by that winning adventuress Isabel Guilbert, the opera singer, whose troupe of performers had been entertained by the president at San Mateo during the past month on a scale less modest than that with which royal visitors are often content.The reference to the “jack-rabbit line” could mean nothing else than the mule-back system of transport that prevailed between Coralio and the capital.The hint that the “boodle” was “six figures short” made the condition of the national treasury lamentably clear.Also it was convincingly true that the ingoing party—its way now made a pacific one—would need the “spondulicks.”Unless its pledges should be fulfilled, and the spoils held for the delectation of the victors, precarious indeed, would be the position of the new government.Therefore it was exceeding necessary to “collar the main guy,” and recapture the sinews of war and government."
"古德温把情报递给了基奥。","Goodwin handed the message to Keogh."
"“读读吧，比利，”他说，“鲍勃·恩格尔哈特发来的。你能对付那密码吗？”","“Read that, Billy,” he said.“It’s from Bob Englehart.Can you manage the cipher?”"
"基奥坐在门道的另一边，认真地读起了电报。","Keogh sat in the other half of the doorway, and carefully perused the telegram."
"“这不是密码，”终于，他说道，”这是他们称之为文学的玩意儿，人们老挂在嘴边上的语言，但富有想象力的作家从不用它。这玩意儿是杂志发明的；不过我以前真不知道诺文·格林局长会准许拍发这样的电文。现在，这玩意儿已经算不得文学，而成为一种语言了。编词典的人们试图将它归类，但也只能把它算作方言的一种。当然，既然西部联合电报公司承认了这种语言，不久就会有一大帮人用它来发电报了。”","“’Tis not a cipher,” he said, finally.“’Tis what they call literature, and that’s a system of language put in the mouths of people that they’ve never been introduced to by writers of imagination.The magazines invented it, but I never knew before that President Norvin Green had stamped it with the seal of his approval.’Tis now no longer literature, but language.The dictionaries tried, but they couldn’t make it go for anything but dialect.Sure, now that the Western Union indorses it, it won’t be long till a race of people will spring up that speaks it.”"
"“你扯得太远了，都谈开语言学了，比利。”古德温说，“你弄懂电文的意思了吗？”","“You’re running too much to philology, Billy,” said Goodwin.“Do you make out the meaning of it?”"
"“当然。”这位神机妙算的哲人答道，“一个人只要肯学，任何语言都会变得容易。我曾经读懂过用古汉语写的一条命令，要求在后膛炮的掩护下撤退。我手上这篇文绉绉的小短文指的是一种名叫“早晨狐狸”的游戏。你小时候玩过这游戏吗，弗兰克？”","“Sure,” replied the philosopher of Fortune.“All languages come easy to the man who must know ’em.I’ve even failed to misunderstand an order to evacuate in classical Chinese when it was backed up by the muzzle of a breech-loader.This little literary essay I hold in my hands means a game of Fox-in-the-Morning.Ever play that, Frank, when you was a kid?”"
"“我想我玩过。”古德温笑着说，“手拉手，围成圈，然后——”","“I think so,” said Goodwin, laughing.“You join hands all ’round, and—”"
"“不对，”基奥打断了他，你把这个好玩的探险游戏和‘环绕玫瑰丛’弄混了。‘早晨狐狸’的精神与手拉手正好相反。我告诉你怎么玩。总统大人和他的游戏同伴在圣马特奥站好，准备出逃，喊道：‘早晨狐狸！’你和我，站在这儿，我们说：‘母鹅公鹅！’他们说：‘到伦敦有多少里？’我们说：‘如果腿够长，只有几里。出来多少只？＇他们说：‘多得抓不完。’然后，游戏正式开始了。”","“You do not,” interrupted Keogh.“You’ve got a fine sporting game mixed up in your head with ‘All Around the Rosebush.’The spirit of ‘Fox-in-the-Morning’ is opposed to the holding of hands.I’ll tell you how it’s played.This president man and his companion in play, they stand up over in San Mateo, ready for the run, and shout: ‘Fox-in-the-Morning!’Me and you, standing here, we say: ‘Goose and the Gander!’They say: ‘How many miles is it to London town?’We say: ‘Only a few, if your legs are long enough.How many comes out?’They say: ‘More than you’re able to catch.’And then the game commences.”"
"“我懂了，”古德温说，“不能让母鹅和公鹅从我们手中溜走，比利。他们的羽毛太值钱了。我们的人已经准备好，随时能接管政府；但由于财政亏空，我们就像新手骑在未驯服的野马背上，掌权时间绝对长不了。我们必须严密监视每一寸海岸，防止他们逃出这个国家。”","“I catch the idea,” said Goodwin.“It won’t do to let the goose and gander slip through our fingers, Billy; their feathers are too valuable.Our crowd is prepared and able to step into the shoes of the government at once; but with the treasury empty we’d stay in power about as long as a tenderfoot would stick on an untamed bronco.We must play the fox on every foot of the coast to prevent their getting out of the country.”"
"“走那条主要靠骡子运输的道路，”基奥说，“从圣马特奥到海边得五天。我们有充分的时间去建立哨所。整条海岸只有三个地方可供他们出航——这儿、索里塔斯和阿拉赞。我们只需守住这几个点。这就像下棋一样简单——耍点花样，三步制胜。呵呵，母鹅，母鹅，公鹅，你们想逛到哪儿去？多亏这封文绉绉的电报，这个愚昧国家的财富将由力图推翻它的诚实政党来保管了。”","“By the mule-back schedule,” said Keogh, “it’s five days down from San Mateo.We’ve got plenty of time to set our outposts.There’s only three places on the coast where they can hope to sail from—here and Solitas and Alazan.They’re the only points we’ll have to guard.It’s as easy as a chess problem—fox to play, and mate in three moves.Oh, goosey, goosey, gander, whither do you wander?By the blessing of the literary telegraph the boodle of this benighted fatherland shall be preserved to the honest political party that is seeking to overthrow it.”"
"基奥恰到好处地概括了当前的形势。从首都到海边的那条道路任何时候都很难走。它崎岖不平，非冷即热，非湿即干。那条路沿着险峻的山峰盘旋而上，像一条烂绳子悬挂在陡峭的悬崖边缘；它穿过白雪覆盖的冰冷河流，然后像蛇一般蜿蜒前行，穿过暗无天日的森林，那里活跃着各种动物，到处都是危险的昆虫。到了山脚下，它又转向一个三岔路口，中间那条路一直通往阿拉赞。另两条岔路一条通向科拉里奥，一条通向索里塔斯。在海和山丘之间是五英里宽的冲积海岸。这里，热带植物遍地疯长，十分茂盛。人们在丛林各处开垦出一块块空地，种植香蕉、甘蔗和橘树。丛林的其余部分则覆盖着杂乱的野生植被，栖息着猴子、貘、美洲豹、短吻鳄，还有巨大的爬行动物和昆虫。没路的地方，藤蔓和匍匐植物交织在一起，连蛇都很难爬过。而危险的红树沼泽，几乎只有长着翅膀的动物才能安全穿越。因此，逃亡者只有走上述三条道路中的一条，才有望到达海边。","The situation had been justly outlined by Keogh.The down trail from the capital was at all times a weary road to travel.A jiggety-joggety journey it was; ice-cold and hot, wet and dry.The trail climbed appalling mountains, wound like a rotten string about the brows of breathless precipices, plunged through chilling snow-fed streams, and wriggled like a snake through sunless forests teeming with menacing insect and animal life.After descending to the foothills it turned to a trident, the central prong ending at Alazan.Another branched off to Coralio; the third penetrated to Solitas.Between the sea and the foothills stretched the five miles breadth of alluvial coast.Here was the flora of the tropics in its rankest and most prodigal growth.Spaces here and there had been wrested from the jungle and planted with bananas and cane and orange groves.The rest was a riot of wild vegetation, the home of monkeys, tapirs, jaguars, alligators and prodigious reptiles and insects.Where no road was cut a serpent could scarcely make its way through the tangle of vines and creepers.Across the treacherous mangrove swamps few things without wings could safely pass.Therefore the fugitives could hope to reach the coast only by one of the routes named."
"“这事不要声张，比利，”古德温建议道，“咱们可不能让执政派知道总统在逃。我想鲍勃提供的情报在首都仍是一条内幕消息。否则，他也不会这样尽力保密，我们大家也早该听说这条新闻了。我现在要去找扎瓦拉医生，然后派个人到那条路上切断电报线路。”","“Keep the matter quiet, Billy,” advised Goodwin.“We don’t want the Ins to know that the president is in flight.I suppose Bob’s information is something of a scoop in the capital as yet.Otherwise he would not have tried to make his message a confidential one; and besides, everybody would have heard the news.I’m going around now to see Dr. Zavalla, and start a man up the trail to cut the telegraph wire.”"
"古德温站起身，这时基奥把他的帽子扔到门边的草地上，重重地叹了一口气。","As Goodwin rose, Keogh threw his hat upon the grass by the door and expelled a tremendous sigh."
"“出什么事了，比利？”古德温停下来问，“这是我第一次听见你叹气。”","“What’s the trouble, Billy?” asked Goodwin, pausing.“That’s the first time I ever heard you sigh.”"
"“也是最后一次。”基奥说，“听到这不幸的消息，我甘愿忍受这种虽然值得赞许却也有不少烦恼的生活。请想想看，那些尊贵而快活的公鹅母鹅们拥有多少良机，相比之下，铁板照相算什么呀？不是我想当总统，弗兰克——他拿的那笔款子太大了，我应付不了——但在某种程度上，我的良心总在责备我，因为我太专注于为这个国家的人拍照，而从没想过带着这个国家的全部财富逃跑。弗兰克，你见过总统阁下包起来带走的那捆‘平纹细布’吗？”","“’Tis the last,” said Keogh.“With that sorrowful puff of wind I resign myself to a life of praiseworthy but harassing honesty.What are tintypes, if you please, to the opportunities of the great and hilarious class of ganders and geese?Not that I would be a president, Frank—and the boodle he’s got is too big for me to handle—but in some ways I feel my conscience hurting me for addicting myself to photographing a nation instead of running away with it.Frank, did you ever see the ‘bundle of muslin’ that His Excellency has wrapped up and carried off?”"
"“伊莎贝尔·吉尔伯特？”古德温笑着说，“没有，我从未见过她。但根据有关她的种种传闻，我想她为了达到自己的目的，不会在一棵树上吊死的。别瞎想了，比利。有时我真有点担心你的祖先有爱尔兰血统。”","“Isabel Guilbert?” said Goodwin, laughing.“No, I never did.From what I’ve heard of her, though, I imagine that she wouldn’t stick at anything to carry her point.Don’t get romantic, Billy.Sometimes I begin to fear that there’s Irish blood in your ancestry.”"
"""我也从没见过她，”基奥接着说，“但据说她的美使所有神话、雕塑及小说中的女人都黯然失色。人们说，只要她看哪个男人一眼，他就会变成猴子，爬到树上为她摘椰子。想想那位总统大人，一手拿着天知道多少万的款子，另一只手挽着这海妖似的女人，骑在可怜的骡子身上，在鸟语花香中奔下山去！而我，正直的比利·基奥，为了过诚实本分的生活，注定整天跟这无利可图的骗人玩意儿打交道，把这些丑得像猴子的人脸印在镀锡铁板上！这是大自然的不公。”","“I never saw her either,” went on Keogh; “but they say she’s got all the ladies of mythology, sculpture, and fiction reduced to chromos.They say she can look at a man once, and he’ll turn monkey and climb trees to pick cocoanuts for her.Think of that president man with Lord knows how many hundreds of thousands of dollars in one hand, and this muslin siren in the other, galloping down hill on a sympathetic mule amid songbirds and flowers!And here is Billy Keogh, because he is virtuous, condemned to the unprofitable swindle of slandering the faces of missing links on tin for an honest living!’Tis an injustice of nature.”"
"“振作些，”古德温说，“你这只聪明透顶的穷狐狸不该嫉妒一只呆鹅啊。等我们把吉伯特的高贵护卫变成穷光蛋，这迷人的美人或许会爱上你和你的铁板照相呢。”","“Cheer up,” said Goodwin.“You are a pretty poor fox to be envying a gander.Maybe the enchanting Guilbert will take a fancy to you and your tintypes after we impoverish her royal escort.”"
"“那她的日子就没这么好过啦，”基奥沉思了一阵，说，“不过她不会爱上我的。她能给画廊里的神仙增色，放在照相馆里却有点别扭。她可是个不可多得的女人，那位总统走运了。我听见克兰西在后屋骂人呢，说所有的活都得他来干。”基奥向照相馆后面的屋子冲去，不由自主吹起了欢快的口哨，和他刚才对逃亡的总统是否有好运的叹息完全不符。","“She could do worse,” reflected Keogh; “but she won’t.’Tis not a tintype gallery, but the gallery of the gods that she’s fitted to adorn.She’s a very wicked lady, and the president man is in luck.But I hear Clancy swearing in the back room for having to do all the work.”And Keogh plunged for the rear of the “gallery,” whistling gaily in a spontaneous way that belied his recent sigh over the questionable good luck of the flying president."
"古德温拐进了一条与大街垂直的小巷。","Goodwin turned from the main street into a much narrower one that intersected it at a right angle."
"这些偏僻小巷里都长满了茂密的杂草，警察的大砍刀已将它们砍平。石板铺的人行道只比壁架宽一点点，沿着清一色的简陋土坯房向前延伸。在村子的外围，这种小巷就消失了；这里都是加勒比人和更穷的土著人的棚屋，棚顶覆盖着棕榈叶，还有来自牙买加和西印度群岛的黑人们所住的破烂小屋。在大片红屋顶的平房之中，有几座建筑显得鹤立鸡群——卡拉波泽的钟楼，“外国人”酒店，维苏威水果公司代理商的住宅，伯纳德·布兰尼根的商店及住宅，还有哥伦布曾驻足过的大教堂遗址；而最富丽堂皇的当属莫雷纳城堡——安楚里亚总统的避暑“白宫”。在沿海滩延伸的主街上——科拉里奥的百老汇——坐落着大商店、政府的仓库和邮局、兵营、酒馆和市场。","These side streets were covered by a growth of thick, rank grass, which was kept to a navigable shortness by the machetes of the police.Stone sidewalks, little more than a ledge in width, ran along the base of the mean and monotonous adobe houses.At the outskirts of the village these streets dwindled to nothing; and here were set the palm-thatched huts of the Caribs and the poorer natives, and the shabby cabins of negroes from Jamaica and the West India islands.A few structures raised their heads above the red-tiled roofs of the one-story houses—the bell tower of the Calaboza, the Hotel de los Estranjeros, the residence of the Vesuvius Fruit Company’s agent, the store and residence of Bernard Brannigan, a ruined cathedral in which Columbus had once set foot, and, most imposing of all, the Casa Morena—the summer “White House” of the President of Anchuria.On the principal street running along the beach—the Broadway of Coralio—were the larger stores, the government bodega and post-office, the cuartel, the rum-shops and the market place."
"半路上，古德温经过伯纳德·布兰尼根家。这是一座两层高的现代木结构建筑。底层是布兰尼根的店铺，上面一层是用来居住的房间。一条宽大凉爽的门廊顺着房子外墙绕了半圈。一个俊俏可爱的姑娘，穿着整洁飘逸的白衣服，倚着栏杆，朝楼下的古德温微笑。她的皮肤和出身高贵的安达卢西亚人一样白皙，整个人就像热带地区的月光那样熠熠生辉。","On his way Goodwin passed the house of Bernard Brannigan.It was a modern wooden building, two stories in height.The ground floor was occupied by Brannigan’s store, the upper one contained the living apartments.A wide cool porch ran around the house half way up its outer walls.A handsome, vivacious girl neatly dressed in flowing white leaned over the railing and smiled down upon Goodwin.She was no darker than many an Andalusian of high descent; and she sparkled and glowed like a tropical moonlight."
"“晚上好，葆拉小姐。”古德温摘下帽子，带着一贯的微笑说道。无论是跟女人还是男人说话，他的态度几乎都一样。科拉里奥的每个人都乐意接受这个大个子美国人的问候。","“Good evening, Miss Paula,” said Goodwin, taking off his hat, with his ready smile.There was little difference in his manner whether he addressed women or men.Everybody in Coralio liked to receive the salutation of the big American."
"“有什么新鲜事吗，古德温先生？可别说没有呀。天挺热吧？我的感觉就像玛丽安娜坐在她那壕沟环绕的农庄里——或者说是牧场里——真是热死了。”","“Is there any news, Mr. Goodwin?Please don’t say no.Isn’t it warm?I feel just like Mariana in her moated grange—or was it a range?—it’s hot enough.”"
"“没有，我想没啥值得一提的新闻，”古德温眼神中带着一丝顽皮，“除了老格迪脾气一天比一天坏。如果没有什么事情能让他精神放松，我就再也不能在他的后门廊里吸烟了——那儿可是最最凉快的地方。”","“No, there’s no news to tell, I believe,” said Goodwin, with a mischievous look in his eye, “except that old Geddie is getting grumpier and crosser every day.If something doesn’t happen to relieve his mind I’ll have to quit smoking on his back porch—and there’s no other place available that is cool enough.”"
"“他脾气不坏，”葆拉冲动地说道，“当他——”","“He isn’t grumpy,” said Paula Brannigan, impulsively, “when he—”"
"但她突然不说了，满脸羞红地跑回屋里；她的母亲是混血儿，西班牙血统赋予葆拉一种天生的羞赧，这一点与她另一半外露的天性相得益彰，显得十分可爱。","But she ceased suddenly, and drew back with a deepening colour; for her mother had been a mestizo lady, and the Spanish blood had brought to Paula a certain shyness that was an adornment to the other half of her demonstrative nature."
