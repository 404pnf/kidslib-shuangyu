"两位感恩节的绅士","Two Thanksgiving Day Gentlemen"
"作者：欧·亨利","by O. Henry"
"那是属于我们的一天。这一天，所有我们美国人，只要是父母生养的，都要回老家吃点苏打饼干，并惊叹那旧水泵看起来比过去竟离门廊近了许多。求神赐福这一天。罗斯福总统给了我们这一天。我们听说一些关于清教徒的事，但我们不仅只是记住了他们是谁。我敢说，如果他们设法再次登陆，我们无论如何都能把他们打败。普利茅斯海岸巨砾吗？噢，那听起来更熟悉。自从火鸡托拉斯进驻市场以来，我们中的许多人已经不得不降格改吃母鸡了。不过，华盛顿的某些人把关于这些感恩节公告的信息预先透露给了他们。","There is one day that is ours.There is one day when all we Americans who are not self-made go back to the old home to eat saleratus biscuits and marvel how much nearer to the porch the old pump looks than it used to.Bless the day.President Roosevelt gives it to us.We hear some talk of the Puritans, but don’t just remember who they were.Bet we can lick ’em, anyhow, if they try to land again.Plymouth Rocks?Well, that sounds more familiar.Lots of us have had to come down to hens since the Turkey Trust got its work in.But somebody in Washington is leaking out advance information to ’em about these Thanksgiving proclamations."
"位于越橘沼泽地东边的那座大城市已经把感恩节定为了一种制度。一年当中，只有在十一月的最后一个星期四这一天，它才承认渡口对岸也是美国的领土。这是美国独有的一天。是的，这是一个欢庆的日子，美国独享。","The big city east of the cranberry bogs has made Thanksgiving Day an institution.The last Thursday in November is the only day in the year on which it recognizes the part of America lying across the ferries.It is the one day that is purely American.Yes, a day of celebration, exclusively American."
"这个故事会向你证明，在大洋的这一边，我们有这样的传统，而且比起英格兰的，我们的传统正以更快的速度变得愈加古老——这都要归功于我们的活力和进取心。","And now for the story which is to prove to you that we have traditions on this side of the ocean that are becoming older at a much rapider rate than those of England are—thanks to our git-up and enterprise."
"当你从东面走进联合广场，斯塔菲·皮特已坐在喷泉对面人行道上右边第三条长椅上了。九年来，每到感恩节这一天，他都会在一点钟准时坐到他的位子上。每次他这样做的时候，有些事情——类似于查尔斯·狄更斯作品中的事——就会发生在他身上，这会让他马甲胸部以上的部分鼓起来，背部也是一样。","Stuffy Pete took his seat on the third bench to the right as you enter Union Square from the east, at the walk opposite the fountain.Every Thanksgiving Day for nine years he had taken his seat there promptly at 1 o’clock.For every time he had done so things had happened to him—Charles Dickensy things that swelled his waistcoat above his heart, and equally on the other side."
"但是今天，斯塔菲·皮特出现在这个每年都会前来的约会地点似乎只是出于习惯，而不是像往年一样因为饥饿。慈善家们大概都认为，饥饿要间隔一年之久才会再次折磨穷人。","But to-day Stuffy Pete’s appearance at the annual trysting place seemed to have been rather the result of habit than of the yearly hunger which, as the philanthropists seem to think, afflicts the poor at such extended intervals."
"可以确定的是，皮特并不饿。他刚参加完一场盛宴，并且让他只剩下了勉强够呼吸和走路的力气。他的双眼就像是两颗色泽暗淡的醋栗，牢牢地嵌在一张浮肿的、涂满了肉汁的油灰面具上。他急促地喘着粗气，一圈参议员特有的脂肪使他立起的衣领不再时髦。一星期前，他衣服上的纽扣刚被好心的救世军手工缝上，现在却像爆米花一样飞了出去，散落在他旁边的地上。他衣衫破烂，衬衫的前襟裂开，露出了如愿骨，但十一月的微风卷着细小的雪花，给他带来的却只是舒适的凉意。因为那过于丰盛的一餐所产生的热量让斯塔菲·皮特不堪负荷——第一道是牡蛎，最后是葡萄干布丁，中间包括（对他而言好像是）全世界所有的烤火鸡、烤土豆、鸡肉色拉、南瓜饼和冰激凌。因此，他坐在那里，肚子塞得满满的，带着一种饱餐后的满足，轻蔑地注视着这个世界。","Certainly Pete was not hungry.He had just come from a feast that had left him of his powers barely those of respiration and locomotion.His eyes were like two pale gooseberries firmly imbedded in a swollen and gravy-smeared mask of putty.His breath came in short wheezes; a senatorial roll of adipose tissue denied a fashionable set to his upturned coat collar.Buttons that had been sewed upon his clothes by kind Salvation fingers a week before flew like popcorn, strewing the earth around him.Ragged he was, with a split shirt front open to the wishbone; but the November breeze, carrying fine snowflakes, brought him only a grateful coolness.For Stuffy Pete was overcharged with the caloric produced by a super-bountiful dinner, beginning with oysters and ending with plum pudding, and including (it seemed to him) all the roast turkey and baked potatoes and chicken salad and squash pie and ice cream in the world.Wherefore he sat, gorged, and gazed upon the world with after-dinner contempt."
"那顿饭是不期而至的。当时他正路过第五大道起点处的一座红砖宅第，里面住着两位来自古老家族的、尊重传统的老妇人。她们甚至不承认纽约的存在，认为感恩节只是为华盛顿广场设立的。她们的一个传统习惯是让一名仆人等在后门口，奉命把正午钟声敲响后走过的第一位饥饿的路人请进来，设宴盛情款待他一番。斯塔菲·皮特在去公园的路上碰巧经过那里，管家就将他领了进去，保持了城堡的传统。","The meal had been an unexpected one.He was passing a red brick mansion near the beginning of Fifth Avenue, in which lived two old ladies of ancient family and a reverence for traditions.They even denied the existence of New York, and believed that Thanksgiving Day was declared solely for Washington Square.One of their traditional habits was to station a servant at the postern gate with orders to admit the first hungry wayfarer that came along after the hour of noon had struck, and banquet him to a finish.Stuffy Pete happened to pass by on his way to the park, and the seneschals gathered him in and upheld the custom of the castle."
"斯塔菲·皮特直直地盯着前方十分钟后，才想起来要转换一下视野。他费了好大的力气，才慢慢把头转向左边。这时，他吓得眼球都凸了出来，屏住了呼吸，两条短腿下穿着的钉鞋在沙砾路面上蹭来蹭去，发出沙沙的声音。","After Stuffy Pete had gazed straight before him for ten minutes he was conscious of a desire for a more varied field of vision.With a tremendous effort he moved his head slowly to the left.And then his eyes bulged out fearfully, and his breath ceased, and the rough-shod ends of his short legs wriggled and rustled on the gravel."
"因为那位老绅士正穿过第四大道，朝他的长椅走来。","For the Old Gentleman was coming across Fourth Avenue toward his bench."
"这九年来，每逢感恩节这天，老绅士都会来到这里，找到坐在长椅上的斯塔菲·皮特。老绅士正试图使这件事成为一项传统。这九年来，每逢感恩节这天，他都在那里找到斯塔菲，然后带他去一家餐馆，看着他吃下一顿大餐。在英格兰，人们会下意识地这么做。可是这是一个年轻的国家，能坚持九年已经很不错了。这位老绅士是一位坚定的美国爱国人士，并自认为是开创美国传统的先锋。为了变得独特，我们必须长期坚持做一件事，决不能半途而废。就像收每周几毛钱的工人劳动保险一样。或者像清扫街道这类事一样。","Every Thanksgiving Day for nine years the Old Gentleman had come there and found Stuffy Pete on his bench.That was a thing that the Old Gentleman was trying to make a tradition of.Every Thanksgiving Day for nine years he had found Stuffy there, and had led him to a restaurant and watched him eat a big dinner.They do those things in England unconsciously.But this is a young country, and nine years is not so bad.The Old Gentleman was a staunch American patriot, and considered himself a pioneer in American tradition.In order to become picturesque we must keep on doing one thing for a long time without ever letting it get away from us.Something like collecting the weekly dimes in industrial insurance.Or cleaning the streets."
"老绅士庄严地径直走向他正在培育的那项制度。说真的，与《大宪章》或早餐吃果酱对于英格兰的意义不同，一年一度喂饱斯塔菲·皮特在性质上完全与国家无关。但它是一个阶段。这会儿差不多算是封建阶段。它至少表明了，对纽——呃哼！——对美国而言，建立一种风俗不是不可能的。","The Old Gentleman moved, straight and stately, toward the Institution that he was rearing.Truly, the annual feeding of Stuffy Pete was nothing national in its character, such as the Magna Charta or jam for breakfast was in England.But it was a step.It was almost feudal.It showed, at least, that a Custom was not impossible to New Y—ahem!—America."
"老绅士又瘦又高，有六十岁了。他穿着一身黑衣服，戴着一副老式眼镜，这副眼镜在你的鼻梁上准是架不住的。比起去年，他的头发变得更白更稀了，他好像也更依赖于那支粗大而多节的弯柄拐杖了。","The Old Gentleman was thin and tall and sixty.He was dressed all in black, and wore the old-fashioned kind of glasses that won’t stay on your nose.His hair was whiter and thinner than it had been last year, and he seemed to make more use of his big, knobby cane with the crooked handle."
"当斯塔菲的固定恩人走过来时，斯塔菲喘着粗气，浑身颤抖着，就像一只被一些女人养得过于肥胖的哈巴狗遇见了对它们竖起毛发的野狗一样。他本应飞速逃走，但是桑托斯－杜蒙特的全部招数也没能使他离开长椅。两位老妇人的忠实仆人办事真是好得没话说。","As his established benefactor came up Stuffy wheezed and shuddered like some woman’s over-fat pug when a street dog bristles up at him.He would have flown, but all the skill of Santos-Dumont could not have separated him from his bench.Well had the myrmidons of the two old ladies done their work."
"“早上好，”老绅士说，“又是一年世事变迁，我很高兴看到你依然健康地活跃在这个美丽的世界上。单为这样的幸事，今天的感恩节就可算是专为我们二人而设。要是你愿意跟我来，我的朋友，我会请你吃顿饭，让你的身体像你的头脑一样充实。”","“Good morning,” said the Old Gentleman.“I am glad to perceive that the vicissitudes of another year have spared you to move in health about the beautiful world.For that blessing alone this day of thanksgiving is well proclaimed to each of us.If you will come with me, my man, I will provide you with a dinner that should make your physical being accord with the mental.”"
"这就是老绅士每次都会说的话。九年了，每次感恩节都是如此。这句话本身似乎都快成了一种制度。除了《独立宣言》，没有什么可与之媲美。以前，这番话在斯塔菲听来总是如音乐一般。而现在，他两眼含泪，痛苦地仰望着老绅士的脸。细小的雪花落在他渗满汗水的额头上，几乎咝咝作响。而老绅士微微打了个冷战，转过身背对着风。","That is what the old Gentleman said every time.Every Thanksgiving Day for nine years.The words themselves almost formed an Institution.Nothing could be compared with them except the Declaration of Independence.Always before they had been music in Stuffy’s ears.But now he looked up at the Old Gentleman’s face with tearful agony in his own.The fine snow almost sizzled when it fell upon his perspiring brow.But the Old Gentleman shivered a little and turned his back to the wind."
"斯塔菲一直不明白，为什么老绅士讲那番话时总是那么哀伤。他不明白，这是因为老绅士每次都希望自己有个儿子来接替自己。他希望在他离世之后，有一个儿子能愿意来到这里，希望这个儿子能自豪而坚定地站在斯塔菲的某个后继者面前说：“为了纪念我的父亲。”这样它就成了一种制度。","Stuffy had always wondered why the Old Gentleman spoke his speech rather sadly.He did not know that it was because he was wishing every time that he had a son to succeed him.A son who would come there after he was gone—a son who would stand proud and strong before some subsequent Stuffy, and say: “In memory of my father.”Then it would be an Institution."
"可是老绅士没有亲人。在公园东边一条僻静的街道上有一些破落的、原属于某些古老家族的褐色砂石宅第，他在其中一幢房子里租了几间屋子，住在里面。冬天，他会在一个扁行李箱大小的小温室里养些倒挂金钟。春天，他参加复活节大游行。夏天，他住在新泽西州山间的一座农舍里，坐在柳条编的扶手椅上，与人谈论着一种蝴蝶，一种他希望有朝一日能找到的鸟翅蝶。秋天，他请斯塔菲吃一顿饭。这些就是老绅士的职业。","But the Old Gentleman had no relatives.He lived in rented rooms in one of the decayed old family brownstone mansions in one of the quiet streets east of the park.In the winter he raised fuchsias in a little conservatory the size of a steamer trunk.In the spring he walked in the Easter parade.In the summer he lived at a farmhouse in the New Jersey hills, and sat in a wicker armchair, speaking of a butterfly, the ornithoptera amphrisius, that he hoped to find some day.In the autumn he fed Stuffy a dinner.These were the Old Gentleman’s occupations."
"斯塔菲·皮特仰望了他半分钟，焦虑而无助地沉浸在自哀自怜中。施与的快乐让老绅士的眼睛闪闪发亮。他脸上的皱纹一年比一年多，但那小小的黑色蝴蝶型领结一如既往地神气十足。他的亚麻衬衫漂亮又洁白，灰白色的八字胡尖留着悉心打理出的弧度。这时斯塔菲发出一种响声，听起来就像豌豆在锅里翻滚的那种咕嘟声。斯塔菲本应该说些什么的，因为那种咕嘟声老绅士之前已听过九次，他准确地把它理解为斯塔菲接受邀请的老套路。","Stuffy Pete looked up at him for a half minute, stewing and helpless in his own self-pity.The Old Gentleman’s eyes were bright with the giving-pleasure.His face was getting more lined each year, but his little black necktie was in as jaunty a bow as ever, and the linen was beautiful and white, and his gray mustache was curled carefully at the ends.And then Stuffy made a noise that sounded like peas bubbling in a pot.Speech was intended; and as the Old Gentleman had heard the sounds nine times before, he rightly construed them into Stuffy’s old formula of acceptance."
"“谢谢您，先生。我会跟您去的，十分感激。我饿极了，先生。”","“Thankee, sir.I’ll go with ye, and much obliged.I’m very hungry, sir.”"
"吃饱后的迷糊并没有阻止这样的信念进入斯塔菲的大脑——他是一项制度存在的基础。他感恩节时的胃口并不只属于他自己；如果不依据现行的《消灭时效法规》，而是按照既定习俗中的所有神圣的权利，他的胃口也属于这位享有优先权的好心的老绅士。不错，美国是自由的，但是为了建立传统，必须有人来做循环节——一个循环小数。英雄们并非都是用钢铁和黄金炼成的。看这一位，他挥舞的武器只是拙劣地镀了些银的铁器，还有一些锡器。","The coma of repletion had not prevented from entering Stuffy’s mind the conviction that he was the basis of an Institution.His Thanksgiving appetite was not his own; it belonged by all the sacred rights of established custom, if not, by the actual Statute of Limitations, to this kind old gentleman who had preempted it.True, America is free; but in order to establish tradition some one must be a repetend—a repeating decimal.The heroes are not all heroes of steel and gold.See one here that wielded only weapons of iron, badly silvered, and tin."
"老绅士领着他每年帮助一次的保护对象朝南走去，走向那家餐馆的那张餐桌，盛宴总是在那里举行。他们被认了出来。","The Old Gentleman led his annual protege southward to the restaurant, and to the table where the feast had always occurred.They were recognized."
"“那老头儿来了，”一个侍者说，“他每个感恩节都请这个讨饭的大吃一顿。”","“Here comes de old guy,” said a waiter, “dat blows dat same bum to a meal every Thanksgiving.”"
"老绅士坐在桌子对面，像一颗烟熏过的珍珠，容光焕发地面对着这项未来古老传统的奠基石。侍者们用节日的食物堆满了餐桌——而斯塔菲却发出一声叹息，这被人误以为是饥饿的表示。他举起刀叉，为自己永恒的港湾雕刻一顶桂冠。","The Old Gentleman sat across the table glowing like a smoked pearl at his corner-stone of future ancient Tradition.The waiters heaped the table with holiday food—and Stuffy, with a sigh that was mistaken for hunger’s expression, raised knife and fork and carved for himself a crown of imperishable bay."
"没有一位英雄能像他一样英勇地杀出敌阵。火鸡、排骨、汤、蔬菜、馅饼，这些刚一上桌就被吃得精光。他走进餐馆的时候，肚子就已经撑得快到极限了；食物的味道让他几乎失去作为一位绅士的荣耀，但他却像一位真正的骑士一样打起了精神。他看到行善带来的快乐洋溢在老绅士的脸上——那是连倒挂金钟和鸟翅蝶都无法带来的幸福神情——他不忍心扫兴。","No more valiant hero ever fought his way through the ranks of an enemy.Turkey, chops, soups, vegetables, pies, disappeared before him as fast as they could be served.Gorged nearly to the uttermost when he entered the restaurant, the smell of food had almost caused him to lose his honor as a gentleman, but he rallied like a true knight.He saw the look of beneficent happiness on the Old Gentleman’s face—a happier look than even the fuchsias and the ornithoptera amphrisius had ever brought to it—and he had not the heart to see it wane."
"一小时后，斯塔菲战斗胜利，身子往后一靠。“衷心感谢，先生，”他像一根漏气的蒸汽管一样喘着粗气，“衷心感谢您请我吃了这么丰盛的一顿大餐。”接着，他两眼发直，费劲地站起来，向厨房走去。一个侍者让他像陀螺似的打了个转，给他指着门的方向。老绅士仔细地数出一块三毛钱的碎银币，还给侍者留下三枚五分镍币。","In an hour Stuffy leaned back with a battle won.“Thankee kindly, sir,” he puffed like a leaky steam pipe; “thankee kindly for a hearty meal.”Then he arose heavily with glazed eyes and started toward the kitchen.A waiter turned him about like a top, and pointed him toward the door.The Old Gentleman carefully counted out $1.30 in silver change, leaving three nickels for the waiter."
"他们与往年一样在门口分手，老绅士往南走，斯塔菲往北走。","They parted as they did each year at the door, the Old Gentleman going south, Stuffy north."
"转过第一个路口之后，斯塔菲站了一分钟。然后，他的破衣烂衫像猫头鹰的羽毛一样鼓胀起来，他就像一匹被太阳晒晕的马似的倒在了人行道上。","Around the first corner Stuffy turned, and stood for one minute.Then he seemed to puff out his rags as an owl puffs out his feathers, and fell to the sidewalk like a sunstricken horse."
"救护车来的时候，年轻的外科医生和司机都轻声地诅咒他的体重。没有威士忌的味道就没有正当的理由把他移交给巡逻车，于是斯塔菲和他的双份大餐都去了医院。在那里，他们让他平躺在床上，开始检查他是否得了什么怪病，希望有可能用拔出鞘的手术刀查明问题的所在。","When the ambulance came the young surgeon and the driver cursed softly at his weight.There was no smell of whiskey to justify a transfer to the patrol wagon, so Stuffy and his two dinners went to the hospital.There they stretched him on a bed and began to test him for strange diseases, with the hope of getting a chance at some problem with the bare steel."
"瞧啊！一小时后，另一辆救护车把老绅士送了过来。他们把他放在另一张床上，谈论着阑尾炎的话题，因为他看起来付得起这笔账单。","And lo! an hour later another　ambulance brought the Old Gentleman.And they laid him on another bed and spoke of appendicitis, for he looked good for the bill."
"但不一会儿，一位年轻医生碰到了一位年轻护士。他喜欢这位护士的眼睛，便停下脚步跟她聊起病人来。","But pretty soon one of the young doctors met one of the young nurses whose eyes he liked, and stopped to chat with her about the cases."
"“现在躺在那边的那位体面的老绅士，”他说，“你绝对想不到那是一个快要饿死的病人。我猜他是个显赫的古老家族的成员。他告诉我，他已经三天没有吃任何东西了。”","“That nice old gentleman over there, now,” he said, “you wouldn’t think that was a case of almost starvation.Proud old family, I guess.He told me he hadn’t eaten a thing for three days.”"
