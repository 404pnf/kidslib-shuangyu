"The Deserted Woman ","被遗弃的女人"
"by Honoré de Balzac","作者：巴尔扎克"
"In the early spring of 1822, the Paris doctors sent to Lower Normandy a young man just recovering from an inflammatory complaint, brought on by overstudy, or perhaps by excess of some other kind.","1822年的初春，巴黎的大夫们把一位正从炎症中康复的小伙子送到下诺曼底来，他得这病是由于用功过度，或者其他什么方面的过度劳累。"
"His convalescence demanded complete rest, a light diet, bracing air, and freedom from excitement of every kind, and the fat lands of Bessin seemed to offer all these conditions of recovery.","他的康复需要彻底的休息、清淡的饮食、清新爽人的空气以及避免受各种感情的刺激，而贝桑肥沃的土地似乎为他的康复提供了以上所有的便利条件。"
"To Bayeux, a picturesque place about six miles from the sea, the patient therefore betook himself, and was received with the cordiality characteristic of relatives who lead very retired lives, and regard a new arrival as a godsend.","巴约是一个风景如画的城市，离海约六英里远，于是病人便前往此地。他受到了亲戚们的真挚欢迎，因为亲戚们在那里过着隐居的生活，有人来访不禁喜出望外，将其视为天赐之物。"
"All little towns are alike, save for a few local customs.","除了一些当地风俗不同之外，所有的小镇都是相似的。"
"When M. le Baron Gaston de Nueil, the young Parisian in question, had spent two or three evenings in his cousin’s house, or with the friends who made up Mme. de Sainte-Severe’s circle, he very soon had made the acquaintance of the persons whom this exclusive society considered to be “the whole town.” ","这位年轻的巴黎青年叫加斯东·德纽埃尔。在他表姐德圣塞韦尔夫人的家里，或者在她的那一伙朋友家里度过了两三个晚上之后，他便很快认识了这个僻静社会视为“全镇”代表的头面人物们。"
"Gaston de Nueil recognized in them the invariable stock characters which every observer finds in every one of the many capitals of the little States which made up the France of an older day.","加斯东·德纽埃尔把这些人视为一成不变的人物，任何一个观察者都能够在昔日法国的许多藩候的首府里发现他们。"
"First of all comes the family whose claims to nobility are regarded as incontestable, and of the highest antiquity in the department, though no one has so much as heard of them a bare fifty leagues away.","这些人物中首屈一指的，是在这个省里被认为是无可争辩的贵族阶层，其历史也是源远流长的，虽然50里格之外的人根本就没有听说过他们。"
"This species of royal family on a small scale is distantly, but unmistakably, connected with the Navarreins and the Grandlieu family, and related to the Cadignans, and the Blamont-Chauvrys.","这种小型的皇室家族和纳瓦兰家族、葛朗利厄家族的确有着远亲关系，同卡迪央家族和布拉蒙—绍弗里家族也能沾上关系。"
"The head of the illustrious house is invariably a determined sportsman.","这个望族的首领通常是一位果敢的冒险家。"
"He has no manners, crushes everybody else with his nominal superiority, tolerates the sub-prefect much as he submits to the taxes, and declines to acknowledge any of the novel powers created by the nineteenth century, pointing out to you as a political monstrosity the fact that the prime minister is a man of no birth.","他不懂礼节，经常用这有名无实的姓氏优势来欺压别人，他像容忍捐税一样容忍县官的存在，他对19世纪建立起的新贵势力概不承认，还指出如果首相不是出身贵族，那便是政界的一件怪事。"
"His wife takes a decided tone, and talks in a loud voice.","他的妻子说话斩钉截铁，嗓门很高。"
"She has had adorers in her time, but takes the sacrament regularly at Easter.","她在她的时代虽有很多崇拜者，却从不忘记每到复活节时举行圣礼。"
"She brings up her daughters badly, and is of the opinion that they will always be rich enough with their name.","她不懂得教养女儿，总认为她们只要有了贵族姓氏便会永远富有。"
"Neither husband nor wife has the remotest idea of modern luxury.","丈夫和妻子对于现代的奢侈华贵可谓一无所知。"
"They retain a livery only seen elsewhere on the stage, and cling to old fashions in plate, furniture, and equipages, as in language and manner of life.","他们依然保留着只有在戏台上才能看到的装束，坚持使用老式的餐盘、家具和马车，至于语言和生活习惯，他们也偏爱旧式的。"
"This is a kind of ancient state, moreover, that suits passably well with provincial thrift.","而且，这种古老的排场跟外省的节俭风气也还算搭调。"
"The good folk are, in fact, the lords of the manor of a bygone age, minus the quitrents and heriots, the pack of hounds and the laced coats; full of honor among themselves, and one and all loyally devoted to princes whom they only see at a distance.","事实上，他们这些人是过去时代的领主，只是缺少征收免役税和租地继承税的权利、成群的猎犬以及镶着挂饰的制服罢了；在自己人中间，他们充满荣誉感，所有人都对那些只能远远看着的王公们忠心耿耿。"
"The historical house incognito is as quaint a survival as a piece of ancient tapestry.","就像一条古老的挂毯一样，这个历史上名不见经传的家族保留着古怪的特点。"
"Vegetating somewhere among them there is sure to be an uncle or a brother, a lieutenant-general, an old courtier of the Kings’s, who wears the red ribbon of the order of Saint-Louis, and went to Hanover with the Marechal de Richelieu: and here you will find him like a stray leaf out of some old pamphlet of the time of Louis Quinze.","这个家族里一定出现过一位叔伯或兄弟，官至中将，出入宫廷，身上有圣路易下令佩戴的红丝带，曾经追随黎赛留将军出征汉诺威：在这里，你会发现，他就像路易十五时代某本旧册子上散落下来的一页纸。"
"This fossil greatness finds a rival in another house, wealthier, though of less ancient lineage.","跟这个古董似的家族相对立的是另一个家族，更富有，可世系没那么古老。"
"Husband and wife spend a couple of months of every winter in Paris, bringing back with them its frivolous tone and short-lived contemporary crazes.","丈夫和妻子每年冬天去巴黎度几个月假，然后带回来一些轻浮的腔调和转瞬即逝的流行爱好。"
"Madame is a woman of fashion, though she looks rather conscious of her clothes, and is always behind the mode.","夫人是一位时尚达人，虽然看上去打扮得相当用心，可是总跟不上潮流。"
"She scoffs, however, at the ignorance affected by her neighbors.","但因为受邻居的影响，她还无知地嘲笑别人。"
"Her plate is of modern fashion; she has “grooms,” Negroes, a valet-de-chambre, and what-not.","她的餐具是新式的；她拥有几个“小厮”、几个黑奴、一位男侍从等诸如此类的人。"
"Her oldest son drives a tilbury, and does nothing (the estate is entailed upon him), his younger brother is auditor to a Council of State.","他的长子驾驶一辆二轮轻便马车，无所事事（家族财产由他继承），次子是国务委员会的审理员。"
"The father is well posted up in official scandals, and tells you anecdotes of Louis XVIII. and Madame du Cayla.","父亲对官场黑幕了如指掌，经常谈论路易十八与凯拉尔夫人的轶事。"
"He invests his money in the five per cents, and is careful to avoid the topic of cider, but has been known occasionally to fall a victim to the craze for rectifying the conjectural sums-total of the various fortunes of the department.","他购买五厘公债，谨慎避免有关苹果酒的话题，不过有时怪癖发作起来，就会对更正省内各大亨那被推测出的财产总数表现出狂热的兴趣。"
"He is a member of the Departmental Council, has his clothes from Paris, and wears the Cross of the Legion of Honor.","他是省议会议员之一，衣服都是在巴黎定制，身上还佩戴着荣誉军团十字勋章。"
"In short, he is a country gentleman who has fully grasped the significance of the Restoration, and is coining money at the Chamber, but his Royalism is less pure than that of the rival house; he takes the Gazette and the Debats, the other family only read the Quotidienne.","总之，这位乡绅深知王朝复辟的意义，在议会里也是大发其财，不过他的忠君思想却不及那个敌对家族的那么纯粹；他订阅《法兰西新闻》和《辩论报》，而另一家族却只看《每日新闻》。"
"His lordship the Bishop, a sometime Vicar-General, fluctuates between the two powers, who pay him the respect due to religion, but at times they bring home to him the moral appended by the worthy Lafontaine to the fable of the Ass laden with Relics.","以前的代理主教，也是现在的主教大人，在这两大势力之间摇摆不定。他们因为宗教信仰对他非常尊重，但有时也会向他挑明著名的拉封丹在寓言《驮圣骨的驴子》的末尾所揭示的寓意。"
"The good man’s origin is distinctly plebeian.","这个老好人显然出身平民。"
"Then come stars of the second magnitude, men of family with ten or twelve hundred livres a year, captains in the navy or cavalry regiments, or nothing at all.","接下来是一些二等明星了，他们是每年收入一千到一千两百里弗赫的贵族，有的当过海军上校，有的当过骑兵上尉，有的什么也没当过。"
"Out on the roads, on horseback, they rank half-way between the cure bearing the sacraments and the tax collector on his rounds.","骑马在路上走时，他们的位置处于手捧圣杯的神甫和税务长官之间。"
"Pretty nearly all of them have been in the Pages or in the Household Troops, and now are peaceably ending their days in a faisance-valoir, more interested in felling timber and the cider prospects than in the Monarchy.","几乎所有人都在侍卫队或者皇家军队里接受过训练，现在都悠闲地在自己的田庄里消磨时光，他们更关心木材和苹果酒，而非君主政体。"
"Still they talk of the Charter and the Liberals while the cards are making, or over a game at backgammon, when they have exhausted the usual stock of dots, and have married everybody off according to the genealogies which they all know by heart.","不过，当他们按照已烂熟于心的家谱安排完了每个人的婚事，打着牌或者玩着西洋双陆棋的时候，他们也会聊起宪章和自由党人。"

"Their womenkind are haughty dames, who assume the airs of Court ladies in their basket chaises.","他们的妻子则是些傲慢的女人，在形状像篮子的轻便马车里摆出宫廷贵妇的神态。"
"They huddle themselves up in shawls and caps by way of full dress; and twice a year, after ripe deliberation, have a new bonnet from Paris, brought as opportunity offers.","她们用披肩和帽子胡乱打扮一番，就认为是盛装华服了；一年仅两次，还是经过深思熟虑之后，她们才从巴黎买一顶新帽子，而且要看帽子有没有机会被捎过来。"
"Exemplary wives are they for the most part, and garrulous.","她们大都品行规范、喋喋不休。"
"These are the principal elements of aristocratic gentility, with a few outlying old maids of good family, spinsters who have solved the problem: given a human being, to remain absolutely stationary.","这就是这帮文雅贵族的主要成员，其中有几个出身名门的老处女，她们已经解决了以下问题：作为人类如何保持绝对的静止不变。"
"They might be sealed up in the houses where you see them; their faces and their dresses are literally part of the fixtures of the town, and the province in which they dwell.","她们好像被密封在你见到她们的那所房子里，她们的面孔和服饰已经成为她们所居住的那个镇、那个省的固定成分之一。"
"They are its tradition, its memory, its quintessence, the genius loci incarnate.","她们是该镇和该省的传统、记忆、典范和精神化身。"
"There is something frigid and monumental about these ladies; they know exactly when to laugh and when to shake their heads, and every now and then give out some utterance which passes current as a witticism.","这些女人身上都有些冰冷的、极端的东西；她们清楚地知道应该何时微笑、何时点头，也不时地说出几句被认为俏皮的话。"
"A few rich townspeople have crept into the miniature Faubourg Saint-Germain, thanks to their money or their aristocratic leanings.","依仗着财产或偏向于贵族的政见，一些富有的镇民也混进了这个圣日耳曼区的小贵族圈子。"
"But despite their forty years, the circle still say of them, “Young So-and-so has sound opinions,” and of such do they make deputies.","尽管他们已经四十岁了，圈里人谈起他们时依旧说：“还是那样年轻，还是那样思想有见地。”于是他们被选为议员。"
"As a rule, the elderly spinsters are their patronesses, not without comment.","一般而言，这些老处女是他们的后台，有风言风语也是自然的了。"
"Finally, in this exclusive little set include two or three ecclesiastics, admitted for the sake of their cloth, or for their wit; for these great nobles find their own society rather dull, and introduce the bourgeois element into their drawing-rooms, as a baker puts leaven into his dough.","最后，两三个教士也被接纳到了这个唯我独尊的小圈子里，因为他们的服饰或者才智；这些贵族觉得自己的这个社交圈相当沉闷，所以他们把资产阶级成分带进了客厅，正如面包师要把酵母放到面团里一样。"
"The sum-total contained by all heads put together consists of a certain quantity of antiquated notions; a few new inflections brewed in company of an evening being added from time to time to the common stock.","这些头脑中所堆砌起来的全部思想都是由一定数量的迂腐观念组成的；其中也掺杂着一些新思想，这些思想是在晚上的集会中被不时地添加到这一普通思想库中的。"
"Like sea-water in a little creek, the phrases which represent these ideas surge up daily, punctually obeying the tidal laws of conversation in their flow and ebb; you hear the hollow echo of yesterday, to-day, to-morrow, a year hence, and for evermore.","代表这些观念的语句，正如小海湾中的海水一样每日汹涌澎湃，谈话中严格遵守潮涨潮落的自然法则；你会一直听到空洞的回声，昨天、今天、明天、一年后、永远。"
"On all things here below they pass immutable judgments, which go to make up a body of tradition into which no power of mortal man can infuse one drop of wit or sense.","他们对世事的看法永远不变，这些看法已经形成一套传统，任何人都无权往里注入一丁点儿新思想和新见地。"
"The lives of these persons revolve with the regularity of clockwork in an orbit of use and wont which admits of no more deviation or change than their opinions on matters religious, political, moral, or literary.","这些人的生活在习惯的轨道上规律运转着，正如他们对宗教、政治、道德和文学观念一样，这都是无法背离或变更的。"
"If a stranger is admitted to the cenacle, every member of it in turn will say (not without a trace of irony), “You will not find the brilliancy of your Parisian society here,” and proceed forthwith to criticise the life led by his neighbors, as if he himself were an exception who had striven, and vainly striven, to enlighten the rest.","如果一个外地人被允许进入这个小团体，这里的每个成员就会轮番对他讲（带着嘲讽的意味）：“在这儿你可找不到巴黎社会的光彩。”然后他们便斥责起邻里们的生活方式，似乎他们自己是曾徒劳设法开导大众的例外。"
"But any stranger so ill advised as to concur in any of their freely expressed criticism of each other, is pronounced at once to be an ill-natured person, a heathen, an outlaw, a reprobate Parisian “as Parisians mostly are.”","可一个新来的人如果没脑筋到对他们互相之间的任何自由抨击予以随声附和，那么他就会被马上看成一个坏心眼的人，一个异教徒，一个歹徒，一个堕落的巴黎人——“跟大多数巴黎人一样”。"
"Before Gaston de Nueil made his appearance in this little world of strictly observed etiquette, where every detail of life is an integrant part of a whole, and everything is known; where the values of personalty and real estate is quoted like stocks on the vast sheet of the newspaper—before his arrival he had been weighed in the unerring scales of Bayeusaine judgment.","加斯东·德纽埃尔在这个小小的世界里露面之前，就已经被巴约那不会出错的天平称过斤两了。在这个小小的世界里一切都遵循礼节，生活中每个细节都是必不可少的一部分，任何事都一目了然；所有的动产和不动产都像报纸大幅刊登的债券一样报价。"
"His cousin, Mme. de Sainte-Severe, had already given out the amount of his fortune, and the sum of his expectations, had produced the family tree, and expatiated on the talents, breeding, and modesty of this particular branch.","他的表姐——圣赛韦尔夫人，已经公布了他的财产数字、他的期望所得，也出示了他的家谱，还阐述了他这一支的才干、教养以及谦逊。"
"So he received the precise amount of attentions to which he was entitled; he was accepted as a worthy scion of a good stock; and, for he was but twenty-three, was made welcome without ceremony, though certain young ladies and mothers of daughters looked not unkindly upon him.","因此他受到了他理应得到的众多关注；他被认为是优秀贵族的好苗子；尽管一些少女和几个有女儿的母亲对他钟爱有加，但因为他只有23岁，就没有为他准备欢迎仪式。"
"He had an income of eighteen thousand livres from land in the valley of the Auge; and sooner or later his father, as in duty bound, would leave him the chateau of Manerville, with the lands thereunto belonging.","他在奥日谷地有着一万八千里弗赫的年地租收入；他的父亲早晚得遗留给他玛奈维尔古堡以及那里其他的附属田地。"
"As for his education, political career, personal qualities, and qualifications—no one so much as thought of raising the questions.","至于他所受的教育、政治生涯、个人品行以及才能——没有人会对此提出任何异议。"
"His land was undeniable, his rentals steady; excellent plantations had been made; the tenants paid for repairs, rates, and taxes; the apple-trees were thirty-eight years old; and, to crown all, his father was in treaty for two hundred acres of woodland just outside the paternal park, which he intended to enclose with walls.","他的土地肥沃，租金收入稳定；已开拓出优良的农场，佃户承担其维修、费用和捐税；苹果树已种植了38年；尤其是他的父亲还在谈一笔生意，他打算买下同他所继承的庭园相连的那两百英亩森林，并圈起围墙。"
"No hopes of a political career, no fame on earth, can compare with such advantages as these.","这样的优势是任何政治前途、任何在人间的名望都无法与之媲美的。"
"Whether out of malice or design, Mme. de Sainte-Severe omitted to mention that Gaston had an elder brother; nor did Gaston himself say a word about him.","不知是出于恶意还是另有图谋，圣赛韦尔夫人避而不谈加斯东有个哥哥的事；加斯东自己对此也只字不提。"
"But, at the same time, it is true that the brother was consumptive, and to all appearance would shortly be laid in earth, lamented and forgotten.","可虽说如此，这位哥哥的确是患了肺病，似乎不久就要被埋葬、哀悼和遗忘了。"
"At first Gaston de Nueil amused himself at the expense of the circle.","加斯东·德纽埃尔拿这个圈子当消遣。"
"He drew, as it were, for his mental album, a series of portraits of these folk, with their angular, wrinkled faces, and hooked noses, their crotchets and ludicrous eccentricities of dress, portraits which possessed all the racy flavor of truth.","可以说，他在脑子里都给这些家伙画了一系列肖像：棱角分明、布满皱纹的脸，鹰钩鼻、胸针、滑稽古怪的装束。这些肖像真是惟妙惟肖。"
"He delighted in their “Normanisms,” in the primitive quaintness of their ideas and characters.","他喜欢这些人的“诺曼底式”表达，非常喜欢他们守旧的观念和粗野的性格。"
"For a short time he flung himself into their squirrel’s life of busy gyrations in a cage.","他很快就习惯了这种像松鼠在笼中不停打转似的生活。"
"Then he began to feel the want of variety, and grew tired of it.","不久，他又感到这生活缺少变化，于是慢慢厌烦起来。"
"It was like the life of the cloister, cut short before it had well begun.","这就好比修道院里的生活，还没好好开始便已经中断了。"
"He drifted on till he reached a crisis, which is neither spleen nor disgust, but combines all the symptoms of both.","他就这么一天天过着，直到发现自己陷入危机，这危机既非怨恨也非厌恶，但兼具两者的症状。"
"When a human being is transplanted into an uncongenial soil, to lead a starved, stunted existence, there is always a little discomfort over the transition.","当一个人被移植到一块与其志趣不投的土壤中，去过一种挨饿、成长受阻的生活时，这种转变总会带来点儿轻微的痛苦。"
"Then, gradually, if nothing removes him from his surroundings, he grows accustomed to them, and adapts himself to the vacuity which grows upon him and renders him powerless.","然后，慢慢地，如果没有什么东西将他从周围环境中拉走，他就会变得习惯这样的生活，适应这样的空虚，而这种空虚会侵蚀他，使他变得无力。"
"Even now, Gaston’s lungs were accustomed to the air; and he was willing to discern a kind of vegetable happiness in days that brought no mental exertion and no responsibilities.","尽管这样，加斯东的肺部已经习惯了这种空气；他在这种无所用心和无所事事的日子里欣然领悟到了一种单调呆板的幸福。"
"The constant stirring of the sap of life, the fertilizing influences of mind on mind, after which he had sought so eagerly in Paris, were beginning to fade from his memory, and he was in a fair way of becoming a fossil with these fossils, and ending his days among them, content, like the companions of Ulysses, in his gross envelope.","他在巴黎热切追寻的那种生命活力的不停骚动，像肥料一样助他成长的思想碰撞的东西，开始在他记忆里慢慢褪色了，他很有可能会变成这堆化石中的一块，然后像尤利塞斯的同伴们一样，被臃肿的皮囊包裹着，心满意足地死在这堆人中间。"

"One evening Gaston de Nueil was seated between a dowager and one of the vicars-general of the diocese, in a gray-paneled drawing-room, floored with large white tiles.","一天晚上，在一间镶着灰色壁砖的客厅里，加斯东·德纽埃尔坐在一位贵妇遗孀和一位主教教区的牧师中间，客厅的地上铺着白色的大瓷砖。"
"The family portraits which adorned the walls looked down upon four card-tables, and some sixteen persons gathered about them, chattering over their whist.","墙上挂着家族成员的肖像画，画里的人仿佛在看着下方摆着的四把牌桌，有大约16个人围坐在一起，他们边聊天边打着惠斯特纸牌。"
"Gaston, thinking of nothing, digesting one of those exquisite dinners to which the provincial looks forward all through the day, found himself justifying the customs of the country.","加斯东什么也不想，消化着吃下去的精致晚餐，这晚餐可是外省人期盼了一整天的，他发现自己已经认同了当地的风俗习惯。"
"He began to understand why these good folk continued to play with yesterday’s pack of cards and shuffle them on a threadbare tablecloth, and how it was that they had ceased to dress for themselves or others.","他开始理解为什么这些人继续玩昨天的旧纸牌，而且在同一张破旧的桌布上洗牌以及他们是如何停止打扮的，既不为自己也不为别人。"
"He saw the glimmerings of something like a philosophy in the even tenor of their perpetual round, in the calm of their methodical monotony, in their ignorance of the refinements of luxury.","在他们永远循环往复的平静生活里，在他们面对有条理的单调时的那种镇静里，在他们对奢侈高雅的一无所知里，他看到了一种像哲学一样的东西在闪着光。"

"Indeed, he almost came to think that luxury profited nothing; and even now, the city of Paris, with its passions, storms, and pleasures, was scarcely more than a memory of childhood.","的确，他几乎开始认为奢华生活是毫无益处的；甚至那满是激情、风暴和快乐的巴黎城，此时对他来说也只跟童年记忆差不多。"
"He admired in all sincerity the red hands, and shy, bashful manner of some young lady who at first struck him as an awkward simpleton, unattractive to the last degree, and surprisingly ridiculous."
"他真心实意地赞美一个年轻姑娘红润的双手和害羞忸怩的姿态，而初次见面时，他觉得这个姑娘一脸蠢相，毫无魅力可言，可笑至极。"
"His doom was sealed.","他无药可救了。"
"He had gone from the provinces to Paris; he had led the feverish life of Paris; and now he would have sunk back into the lifeless life of the provinces, but for a chance remark which reached his ear—a few words that called up a swift rush of such emotion as he might have felt when a strain of really good music mingles with the accompaniment of some tedious opera.","他以前从外省去过巴黎，在巴黎过着令他兴奋的生活；而如今，要是没有那么偶尔的几句话——几句能让他突然激动起来的话，这些话就像在一出沉闷歌剧的伴奏中突然迸出的一段非常优美的乐曲，让他兴奋不已。"


"“You went to call on Mme. de Beauseant yesterday, did you not?” ","“你昨天不是去拜访过德鲍赛昂夫人吗？”"
"The speaker was an elderly lady, and she addressed the head of the local royal family.","说话的是一位老太太，她在问当地的一位王室家族的主人。"
"“I went this morning.","“我今天早晨去了。"
"She was so poorly and depressed, that I could not persuade her to dine with us to-morrow.”","她身体不好，郁郁寡欢，所以我无法劝她明天来和我们一起吃饭。”"
"“With Mme. de Champignelles?” exclaimed the dowager with something like astonishment in her manner.","“是和德尚皮涅勒夫人一起去的吗？”贵妇遗孀大声问道，脸上露出惊讶的神色。"
"“With my wife,” calmly assented the noble.","“和我妻子一起，”这位贵族平静地回答道，"
"“Mme. de Beauseant is descended from the House of Burgundy, on the spindle side, ’tis true, but the name atones for everything.","“德鲍赛昂夫人是勃艮第家族的人，虽然只是娘家亲戚，可是这个姓已足以洗刷一切了。"
"My wife is very much attached to the Vicomtesse, and the poor lady has lived alone for such a long while, that—”","我妻子很喜欢这位子爵夫人，况且这位可怜的夫人独自一人生活了这么长时间，——”"
"The Marquis de Champignelles looked round about him while he spoke with an air of cool unconcern, so that it was almost impossible to guess whether he made a concession to Mme. de Beauseant’s misfortunes, or paid homage to her noble birth; whether he felt flattered to receive her in his house, or, on the contrary, sheer pride was the motive that led him to try to force the country families to meet the Vicomtesse.","德尚皮涅勒侯爵用漠不关心的冷酷神情环顾周围听他说话的人，因此几乎不可能猜出他所作出的让步是出于同情德鲍赛昂夫人的不幸遭遇呢，还是对她的贵族身份表示敬意；也不知道他是以接待她为荣呢，还是与此相反，只是出于傲慢的自尊心，试图强迫当地的贵族家庭去接见她。"
"The women appeared to take counsel of each other by a glance; there was a sudden silence in the room, and it was felt that their attitude was one of disapproval.","在场的贵妇们面面相觑，似乎在商量着什么；房间里突然安静下来，她们的态度看来是不同意。"
"“Does this Mme. de Beauseant happen to be the lady whose adventure with M. d’Ajuda-Pinto made so much noise?” asked Gaston of his neighbor.","“这位德鲍赛昂夫人不会是和阿瞿达—平托先生恋爱而闹得沸沸扬扬的那位贵妇吧？”加斯东问旁边一位女客。"
"“The very same,” he was told.","“正是，”女客回答，"
"“She came to Courcelles after the marriage of the Marquis d’Ajuda; nobody visits her.","“自从阿瞿达侯爵结婚以后，她就来到了库尔塞勒；没有人拜访她。"
"She has, besides, too much sense not to see that she is in a false position, so she has made no attempt to see any one.","而且，她很聪明，不可能不知道她的艰难处境，因此，她也从不拜访任何人。"
"M. de Champignelles and a few gentlemen went to call upon her, but she would see no one but M. de Champignelles, perhaps because he is a connection of the family.","德尚皮涅勒先生和几位别的先生曾经拜访过她那里，不过她只接见了德尚皮涅勒先生，也许因为他们是亲戚吧。"
"They are related through the Beauseants; the father of the present Vicomte married a Mlle. de Champignelles of the older branch.","他们和鲍赛昂家庭有姻亲关系，老鲍赛昂娶过一位尚皮涅勒家长房的一位小姐。"
"But though the Vicomtesse de Beauseant is supposed to be a descendant of the House of Burgundy, you can understand that we could not admit a wife separated from her husband into our society here.","不过，虽说德鲍赛昂子爵夫人被认为是勃艮第家族的后代，你也该知道我们在这儿是不可能接受一位同丈夫分居的女人的。"
"We are foolish enough still to cling to these old-fashioned ideas.","我们很笨，还保持着这种旧观念。"
"There was the less excuse for the Vicomtesse, because M. de Beauseant is a well-bred man of the world, who would have been quite ready to listen to reason.","这都是子爵夫人的错，因为德鲍赛昂先生是一位有教养的绅士，他一定会很讲道理。"
"But his wife is quite mad—” and so forth and so forth.","但他的妻子是个疯子——”等等。"
"M. de Nueil, still listening to the speaker’s voice, gathered nothing of the sense of the words; his brain was too full of thick-coming fancies.","德纽埃尔先生虽然仍在听着女客的讲话，但全然不知道她在说些什么；他满脑子都是想入非非的念头。"
"Fancies?","幻想？"
"What other name can you give to the alluring charms of an adventure that tempts the imagination and sets vague hopes springing up in the soul; to the sense of coming events and mysterious felicity and fear at hand, while as yet there is no substance of fact on which these phantoms of caprice can fix and feed?","现在艳遇正在向他的想象力微笑招手，灵魂正在孕育着渺茫的希望；他正预感到这即将到来的不可名状的幸福和恐惧，虽然没有什么东西可以向这些变化无常的幻想提供依据，固定下来，可是还能用什么样的语言来形容这种诱惑的魔力呢？"
"Over these fancies thought hovers, conceiving impossible projects, giving in the germ all the joys of love.","这些心思飞到天外，萌生出很多不切实际的计划，爱情的幸福正在萌芽。"
"Perhaps, indeed, all passion is contained in that thought-germ, as the beauty, and fragrance, and rich color of the flower is all packed in the seed.","也许这全部的爱情被包括在思想的萌芽里，就像花朵的美丽、芬芳、艳丽都包含在种子里一样。"
"M. de Nueil did not know that Mme. de Beauseant had taken refuge in Normandy, after a notoriety which women for the most part envy and condemn, especially when youth and beauty in some sort excuse the transgression.","德纽埃尔先生根本就不知道德鲍赛昂夫人来诺曼底避难是由于她经历过一件被大多数女人嫉妒而又谴责的丑闻事件，尤其是当青春和美貌可以为这种过错开脱理由时。"
"Any sort of celebrity bestows an inconceivable prestige.","任何一种名声都会带来令人无法想象的声望。"
"Apparently for women, as for families, the glory of the crime effaces the stain; and if such and such a noble house is proud of its tale of heads that have fallen on the scaffold, a young and pretty woman becomes more interesting for the dubious renown of a happy love or a scandalous desertion, and the more she is to be pitied, the more she excites our sympathies.","显然对于妇女而言，就像家庭一样，罪恶的光荣可以抹掉耻辱；一个家族可以拿自己的族人被砍了多少首级而引以为荣，一位年轻美貌的女子可以因为幸福的爱或者可耻的遗弃而获得可疑的名声，也就变得更加让人着迷，她越是叫人怜悯，就越是能引起人们的同情。"
"We are only pitiless to the commonplace.","我们只对平凡的事物毫不留情。"
"If, moreover, we attract all eyes, we are to all intents and purposes great; how, indeed, are we to be seen unless we raise ourselves above other people’s heads?","况且，我们能够吸引别人的眼光，那么实际上我们就会在别人眼中显得伟大；的确，除了使自己高人一等，我们还能如何让自己得到关注呢？"
"The common herd of humanity feels an involuntary respect for any person who can rise above it, and is not over-particular as to the means by which they rise.","普通人本能地尊敬任何高于他们的人，而不会去关注这些人是用什么方法爬上去的。"
"It may have been that some such motives influenced Gaston de Nueil at unawares, or perhaps it was curiosity, or a craving for some interest in his life, or, in a word, that crowd of inexplicable impulses which, for want of a better name, we are wont to call “fatality,” that drew him to Mme. de Beauseant.","可能是受到上述因素的暗中影响，或者是出于好奇，或者是一种要在生活中寻求乐趣的渴望，或者简单地说，是那些一大堆不可名状的冲动和想法，无法说得清楚，我们通常只能用“命中注定”来解释是什么将他一步步推向德鲍赛昂夫人的。"
"The figure of the Vicomtesse de Beauseant rose up suddenly before him with gracious thronging associations.","子爵夫人的形象忽地出现在他的眼前，还带着一串串亲和高雅的形象。"
"She was a new world for him, a world of fears and hopes, a world to fight for and to conquer.","对他而言，她就是一个新世界，一个充满恐惧和希望的世界，一个值得他去奋斗、去征服的世界。"
"Inevitably he felt the contrast between this vision and the human beings in the shabby room; and then, in truth, she was a woman; what woman had he seen so far in this dull, little world, where calculation replaced thought and feeling, where courtesy was a cut-and-dried formality, and ideas of the very simplest were too alarming to be received or to pass current?","不可避免地，他觉得她与这个庸俗的客厅里的人们形成了鲜明的对比；的确，她是一个女人；他在这个无趣而狭小的世界里，他见到过这样的女人吗？这个世界里，算计代替了思想和感觉，礼貌仅仅是一种俗套，连最简单的见解都带有伤害的成分，既不能被接受也不能被传播。"
"The sound of Mme. de Beauseant’s name revived a young man’s dreams and wakened urgent desires that had lain dormant for a little.","德鲍赛昂夫人的名字唤起了这位年轻小伙子的梦想，也激起了他那曾一度蛰伏的强烈愿望。"
"Gaston de Nueil was absent-minded and preoccupied for the rest of the evening.","加斯东·德纽埃尔一晚上都心不在焉，夜不能寐。"
"He was pondering how he might gain access to Mme. de Beauseant, and truly it was no very easy matter.","他一直在思忖如何接近德鲍赛昂夫人，这的确不是一件容易的事。"
"She was believed to be extremely clever.","据说她聪明绝顶。"
"But if men and women of parts may be captivated by something subtle or eccentric, they are also exacting, and can read all that lies below the surface; and after the first step has been taken, the chances of failure and success in the difficult task of pleasing them are about even.","即便多才多艺的男男女女能够受到微妙或者新奇的事物吸引的话，他们也是要求苛刻的，并且善于看穿谎言；一旦采取得了第一步行动，那么失败或成功取悦他们的机会各占一半。"
"In this particular case, moreover, the Vicomtesse, besides the pride of her position, had all the dignity of her name.","何况这位子爵夫人除了姿态高傲之外，还拥有尊贵的姓氏。"
"Her utter seclusion was the least of the barriers raised between her and the world.","她完全的离群索居是她与外面的世界之间最微不足道的一堵墙。"
"For which reasons it was well-nigh impossible that a stranger, however well born, could hope for admittance; and yet, the next morning found M. de Nueil taking his walks abroad in the direction of Courcelles, a dupe of illusions natural at his age.","由此看来，一位陌生人，不管他出身何等高贵，都不要抱任何希望进入她的家；可是在第二天早晨，德纽埃尔先生在外散步，正朝着库尔塞勒的方向走去，在他这个年龄，是最容易将幻想信以为真的。"
"Several times he made the circuit of the garden walls, looking earnestly through every gap at the closed shutters or open windows, hoping for some romantic chance, on which he founded schemes for introducing himself into this unknown lady’s presence, without a thought of their impracticability.","他沿着花园的围墙转了好多圈，充满渴望地从关闭的百叶窗豁口或者开着的窗户向里面张望，期盼着自己的浪漫时机，计划着让这位素不相识的女人认识自己，而完全没有考虑到他这样做的不现实性。"
"Morning after morning was spent in this way to mighty purpose; but with each day’s walk, that vision of a woman living apart from the world, of love’s martyr buried in solitude, loomed larger in his thoughts, and was enshrined in his soul.","他接连几个早晨如此，以达到自己的目的；可是，每来散一次步，这位生活在世外的女人，这位孤寂隐居的爱情烈女形象，就在他的思想里变得越来越高大，铭刻在了他的灵魂里。"
"So Gaston de Nueil walked under the walls of Courcelles, and some gardener’s heavy footstep would set his heart beating high with hope.","因此，当加斯东·德纽埃尔在沿着库尔塞勒的楼房围墙漫步时，若是听到园丁的笨重脚步声，他就会心跳加快，心生希望。"
"He thought of writing to Mme. de Beauseant, but on mature consideration, what can you say to a woman whom you have never seen, a complete stranger?","他想过要写信给德鲍赛昂夫人，可是经过充分的考虑，对于一位你从未见过的人、一位完完全全的陌生人，你又能说些什么呢？"
"And Gaston had little self-confidence.","况且加斯东自己对此也没有信心。"
"Like most young persons with a plentiful crop of illusions still standing, he dreaded the mortifying contempt of silence more than death itself, and shuddered at the thought of sending his first tender epistle forth to face so many chances of being thrown on the fire.","正像许多充满无数幻想的年轻人一样，比起死亡来，他更害怕那令人苦闷的不予理睬，那是一种蔑视，一想到自己的第一封情书很有可能会被付之一炬，他就会胆战心惊。"
"He was distracted by innumerable conflicting ideas.","他被各种相互矛盾的想法搞得心烦意乱。"
"But by dint of inventing chimeras, weaving romances, and cudgeling his brains, he hit at last upon one of the hopeful stratagems that are sure to occur to your mind if you persevere long enough, a stratagem which must make clear to the most inexperienced woman that here was a man who took a fervent interest in her.","不过经过多次狂想，他编织了各种离奇的经历，绞尽脑汁，最终找到了一条有望的妙计，只要你坚持想下去总会想到。这能让最天真的女人知晓，有一个男人对她热切渴望到了何种程度。"
"The caprice of social conventions puts as many barriers between lovers as any Oriental imagination can devise in the most delightfully fantastic tale; indeed, the most extravagant pictures are seldom exaggerations.","社会上的一种怪象就是经常在两个情人之间设置很多障碍，这些障碍并不比东方诗人在他们想象的奇幻神话中虚构的障碍更少；事实上，这最为夸张的景象也很少有言过其实的。"
"In real life, as in the fairy tales, the woman belongs to him who can reach her and set her free from the position in which she languishes.","在现实生活中，正如童话故事的世界一般，女人的芳心总会属于那个能够到达她身边并且能够将她从哀苦中解放出来的男人。"
"The poorest of calenders that ever fell in love with the daughter of the Khalif is in truth scarcely further from his lady than Gaston de Nueil from Mme. de Beauseant.","最贫苦的游方僧们深深地爱上了哈里发的女儿，他们之间的距离简直不可能比加斯东·德纽埃尔和德鲍赛昂夫人之间的距离更远。"
"The Vicomtesse knew absolutely nothing of M. de Nueil’s wanderings round her house; Gaston de Nueil’s love grew to the height of the obstacles to overleap; and the distance set between him and his extemporized lady-love produced the usual effect of distance, in lending enchantment.","子爵夫人对于德纽埃尔先生游荡于她家旁的事一点儿也不知情；加斯东·德纽埃尔对她的爱却是随着障碍的增加而有增无减；这距离更给予了他和他那即兴做成的情人之间以距离的美感，却让这更具独特的魅力。"
"One day, confident in his inspiration, he hoped everything from the love that must pour forth from his eyes.","他相信自己的灵感，希望总有一天，他希望自己眼中倾泻出的爱情可以帮他获得所有。"
"Spoken words, in his opinion, were more eloquent than the most passionate letter; and, besides, he would engage feminine curiosity to plead for him.","在他看来，话语比最动情的信件更感人至深；并且，他可以寄希望于女性天然的好奇心。"
"He went, therefore, to M. de Champignelles, proposing to employ that gentleman for the better success of his enterprise.","因此，他来到德·尚皮涅勒先生家中，打算利用这位先生来实现自己的企图。"
"He informed the Marquis that he had been entrusted with a delicate and important commission which concerned the Vicomtesse de Beauseant, that he felt doubtful whether she would read a letter written in an unknown handwriting, or put confidence in a stranger.","他告诉这位侯爵，他被委以一桩微妙而重要的任务，是有关德鲍赛昂夫人的，但是他怀疑这位夫人是否会阅读一封不知名的信件，或者会不会相信一位陌生人。"
"Would M. de Champignelles, on his next visit, ask the Vicomtesse if she would consent to receive him—Gaston de Nueil?","他问德尚皮涅勒先生，下次拜访子爵夫人时可否问问她是否愿意会见他——加斯东·德纽埃尔？"
"While he asked the Marquis to keep his secret in case of a refusal, he very ingeniously insinuated sufficient reasons for his own admittance, to be duly passed on to the Vicomtesse.","他告诉侯爵如果遭到拒绝就请他严守秘密，同时巧妙而聪明地促使侯爵将自己要会见子爵夫人的各种充分理由适时地转告给她。"
"Was not M. de Champignelles a man of honor, a loyal gentleman incapable of lending himself to any transaction in bad taste, nay, the merest suspicion of bad taste!","德尚皮涅勒先生难道不是一位看重声誉，忠心耿耿的绅士吗？他是不可能做出任何低品位的事的，不，哪怕是丝毫让人怀疑的举动！"
"Love lends a young man all the self-possession and astute craft of an old ambassador; all the Marquis’ harmless vanities were gratified, and the haughty grandee was completely duped.","爱情给予这位年轻人大使般的沉着和睿智；侯爵的虚荣心得到了满足，这位高傲的大公竟完全上了这位青年人的当。"
"He tried hard to fathom Gaston’s secret; but the latter, who would have been greatly perplexed to tell it, turned off M. de Champignelles’ adroit questioning with a Norman’s shrewdness, till the Marquis, as a gallant Frenchman, complimented his young visitor upon his discretion.","他想方设法地想探究加斯东的秘密；可是加斯东总是面露难色，不能实情相告，便用些诺曼底式的机敏回应德尚皮涅勒的质问，作为豪侠的法兰西人，侯爵尽管询问未果却依然夸奖他的谨慎品质。"
"M. de Champignelles hurried off at once to Courcelles, with that eagerness to serve a pretty woman which belongs to his time of life.","德尚皮涅勒先生立刻匆匆奔向库尔塞勒，满怀热情地向他那个时代的美人儿热心效劳。"
"In the Vicomtesse de Beauseant’s position, such a message was likely to arouse keen curiosity; so, although her memory supplied no reason at all that could bring M. de Nueil to her house, she saw no objection to his visit—after some prudent inquiries as to his family and condition.","从子爵夫人德鲍赛昂夫人目前的处境来看，这样的消息很可能会引起她强烈的好奇心；因此，尽管她实在想不出什么理由将德纽埃尔先生请到家里来，可是在谨慎地询问过他的家庭和境况之后,她也没有什么理由拒绝他的来访。"
"At the same time, she began by a refusal.","不过开始她还是拒绝了。"
"Then she discussed the propriety of the matter with M. de Champignelles, directing her questions so as to discover, if possible, whether he knew the motives for the visit, and finally revoked her negative answer.","然后她和德尚皮涅勒先生讨论了此事的适宜性，她一直询问并试图想知道，如果可能的话，他是否知道这次来访的动机，于是最后才作出撤销拒绝来访的决定。"
"The discussion and the discretion shown perforce by the Marquis had piqued her curiosity.","与侯爵的讨论和侯爵流露出的谨慎态度更激起了她的好奇。"
"M. de Champignelles had no mind to cut a ridiculous figure.","德尚皮涅勒先生不想显得荒谬可笑。"
"He said, with the air of a man who can keep another’s counsel, that the Vicomtesse must know the purpose of this visit perfectly well; while the Vicomtesse, in all sincerity, had no notion what it could be.","他装出为别人保守秘密的样子，告诉子爵夫人一定要清楚地知道此次来访的目的；而子爵夫人，经过一切诚意的探索，仍然不知所以。"
"Mme. de Beauseant, in perplexity, connected Gaston with people whom he had never met, went astray after various wild conjectures, and asked herself if she had seen this M. de Nueil before.","彷徨困惑中的德鲍赛昂夫人将加斯东和她从未见过的人们联系起来，她在各种胡乱的猜想中迷失了自我，甚至问自己是否以前曾经见过德纽埃尔先生。"
"In truth, no love-letter, however sincere or skilfully indited, could have produced so much effect as this riddle.","实践证明，情书表达得不管多么真挚，写得如何技术高超，都无法产生与这个哑谜相同的效果。"
"Again and again Mme. de Beauseant puzzled over it.","德鲍赛昂夫人一遍一遍地苦苦思忖着。"
"When Gaston heard that he might call upon the Vicomtesse, his rapture at so soon obtaining the ardently longed-for good fortune was mingled with singular embarrassment.","当加斯东听说他可以拜访子爵夫人的消息时，他欣喜若狂获得如此热烈渴盼的好运，同时也有一丝怪怪的尴尬。"
"How was he to contrive a suitable sequel to this stratagem?","他该如何为自己计划的这个图谋画上完满的句号呢？"
"“Bah!","“呸！"
"I shall see @her@,” he said over and over again to himself as he dressed.","我要去见她，”他一边穿衣服，一边不停地对自己说着,"
"“See her, and that is everything!”","“见她，这就是一切！”"
"He fell to hoping that once across the threshold of Courcelles he should find an expedient for unfastening this Gordian knot of his own tying.","在踏进库尔塞勒大门时，他就开始想，他应该为他自己出的这个难题找个权宜之计。"
"There are believers in the omnipotence of necessity who never turn back; the close presence of danger is an inspiration that calls out all their powers for victory.","有人相信，人若身处困境便能急中生智，决不退缩；危险来临，他们都能急中生智，竭尽全力以求胜利。"
"Gaston de Nueil was one of these.","加斯东就是这样一种人。"
"He took particular pains with his dress, imagining, as youth is apt to imagine, that success or failure hangs on the position of a curl, and ignorant of the fact that anything is charming in youth.","他绞尽脑汁留意自己的装扮，想象着，因为年轻人喜欢遐想，一绺卷发的位置都会关乎事件的成败，而他们却忽视了一个事实，那就是在年轻时代的一切都具有迷人的魅力。"
"And, in any case, such women as Mme. de Beauseant are only attracted by the charms of wit or character of an unusual order.","而且，不管怎样，像鲍赛昂夫人这样的女人，能够使吸引她们注意的只能是与众不同的才智和品格。"
"Greatness of character flatters their vanity, promises a great passion, seems to imply a comprehension of the requirements of their hearts.","高尚的品格能够满足她们的虚荣心，能够使她们指望伟大的爱情，而且似乎也暗含着能够满足她们心灵的要求。"
"Wit amuses them, responds to the subtlety of their natures, and they think that they are understood.","智慧聪明能够取悦她们，能适应她们微妙的天性，让她们感觉得到了理解。"
"And what do all women wish but to be amused, understood, or adored?","世间的女人除了要求被取悦，被理解，被爱慕之外，还指望什么呢？"
"It is only after much reflection on the things of life that we understand the consummate coquetry of neglect of dress and reserve at a first interview; and by the time we have gained sufficient astuteness for successful strategy, we are too old to profit by our experience.","只有对世事经过了无数次的反省之后，才能懂得在第一次会面时，不注重衣着打扮和不动声色原来是真正的卖弄风骚；等我们已经变得足够机敏，拥有了成功的谋略，却往往年事已高，于事无补了。"
"While Gaston’s lack of confidence in his mental equipment drove him to borrow charms from his clothes, Madame de Beauseant herself was instinctively giving more attention to her toilette.","加斯东先生对自己的聪明才智缺乏自信，才借助服饰来提升自己的魅力，德鲍赛昂夫人自己也本能地装扮起来。"
"“I would rather not frighten people, at all events,” she said to herself as she arranged her hair.","“我无论如何，可不想吓着别人。”她一边自言自语，一边整理着自己的头发。"
"In M. de Nueil’s character, person, and manner there was that touch of unconscious originality which gives a kind of flavor to things that any one might say or do, and absolves everything that they may choose to do or say.","德纽埃尔先生在性格、容貌和举止方面都透着一股天然纯朴的特点，使他平时的想法和做法都饶有趣味，无论他说些什么，做些什么，都能得到谅解。"
"He was highly cultivated, he had a keen brain, and a face, mobile as his own nature, which won the goodwill of others.","他有教养，思想敏锐，外表出众，如同他的天性般活泼机灵，总是能赢得别人的好感。"
"The promise of passion and tenderness in the bright eyes was fulfilled by an essentially kindly heart.","他明亮的眼睛里隐含着激情和温存，心中充满着本质的善良。"
"The resolution which he made as he entered the house at Courcelles was in keeping with his frank nature and ardent imagination.","他下定走进库尔塞勒楼房的决心，是和他坦率的性格和激情的想象相一致的。"
"But, bold has he was with love, his heart beat violently when he had crossed the great court, laid out like an English garden, and the man-servant, who had taken his name to the Vicomtesse, returned to say that she would receive him.","可是，尽管爱情使他胆大，当他穿过一处英国花园式的庭院时心跳得非常剧烈，一位男仆去向子爵夫人报告了他的名字，回来说她愿意接见他。"
"“M. le Baron de Nueil.”","“德纽埃尔男爵先生。”"
"Gaston came in slowly, but with sufficient ease of manner; and it is a more difficult thing, be it said, to enter a room where there is but one woman, than a room that holds a score.","加斯东缓缓地走了进来，却依然保持着举止的淡定自若；不消说，走进只有一个女人的房间比走进有二十位女人的房间要更难。"
"A great fire was burning on the hearth in spite of the mild weather, and by the soft light of the candles in the sconces he saw a young woman sitting on a high-backed bergere in the angle by the hearth.","尽管天气并不冷，壁炉里的火苗依然烧得很旺。透过烛台上淡淡的烛光，他看到壁炉的角落里，一位年轻的女人正坐在一把高背安乐椅上。"
"The seat was so low that she could move her head freely; every turn of it was full of grace and delicate charm, whether she bent, leaning forward, or raised and held it erect, slowly and languidly, as though it were a heavy burden, so low that she could cross her feet and let them appear, or draw them back under the folds of a long black dress.","座位很低，她能够灵活移动头部；她每次甩动头都尽显优雅和妩媚，不管弯腰、俯身，还是抬起头或者直起身，都缓慢而无力，宛如挑起一副重担。座位很低，她可以两脚交叉，伸出双脚，或者缩进去藏在那长长的黑裙褶裥里。"
"The Vicomtesse made as if she would lay the book that she was reading on a small, round stand; but as she did so, she turned towards M. de Nueil, and the volume, insecurely laid upon the edge, fell to the ground between the stand and the sofa.","子爵夫人想把她正在读的书放在一张小圆桌上；可是，正当她那样做时，她转过头来看德纽埃尔先生，把那本书不小心放到了靠边的位置，书落下来掉在了桌子和沙发之间。"
"This did not seem to disconcert her.","她对此事似乎并不感到慌张。"
"She looked up, bowing almost imperceptibly in response to his greeting, without rising from the depths of the low chair in which she lay.","她抬起头来，用几乎无法察觉的微微点头来向他致敬，不过并未从她坐着的低椅中站起身来。"
"Bending forwards, she stirred the fire briskly, and stooped to pick up a fallen glove, drawing it mechanically over her left hand, while her eyes wandered in search of its fellow.","她向前屈下身子，迅速地拨弄了一下炉火，然后俯身去捡起一只掉落的手套，把它机械地放在左手上，而眼神则在寻找着另一只手套的下落。"
"The glance was instantly checked, however, for she stretched out a thin, white, all-but-transparent right hand, with flawless ovals of rose-colored nail at the tips of the slender, ringless fingers, and pointed to a chair as if to bid Gaston be seated.","很快她便收起目光，伸出她那又细又白、晶莹剔透的右手，纤细的指间上玫瑰色的指甲呈现出完美的椭圆形，手上并没有戴戒指。她朝一把椅子指了指，示意加斯东请坐。"
"He sat down, and she turned her face questioningly towards him.","他坐了下来，她便转过头来面带疑惑地朝向他。"
"Words cannot describe the subtlety of the winning charm and inquiry in that gesture; deliberate in its kindliness, gracious yet accurate in expression, it was the outcome of early education and of a constant use and wont of the graciousness of life.","话语都无法形容那姿态展示的魅力与问询的微妙之处；这虽完全出于善意，也极尽优雅，不过却表达到位，这正是由于早期教育和长期习惯于高雅的生活所致。"
"These movements of hers, so swift, so deft, succeeded each other by the blending of a pretty woman’s fastidious carelessness with the high-bred manner of a great lady.","她的这些动作，如此迅速，如此轻巧，成功地将一位美貌少妇的挑剔难悦和她上流社会的贵族风度完美地结合起来。"
"Mme. de Beauseant stood out in such strong contrast against the automatons among whom he had spent two months of exile in that out-of-the-world district of Normandy, that he could not but find in her the realization of his romantic dreams; and, on the other hand, he could not compare her perfections with those of other women whom he had formerly admired.","同他这两个月来被流放到偏远的诺曼底地区所接触的机器人们相比，德·鲍赛昂与她们形成了鲜明的对比，他不得不认为只有在自己浪漫的梦境中才能找到她这样的人；而且，他也无法拿他以前所赞美过的任何女人和她相提并论。"
"Here in her presence, in a drawing-room like some salon in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, full of costly trifles lying about upon the tables, and flowers and books, he felt as if he were back in Paris.","就在她这里，这间客厅里如同圣日耳曼郊区的客厅一样，桌子上满是些昂贵的小玩意儿，还有很多鲜花和书籍，他感到自己好像回到了巴黎。"
"It was a real Parisian carpet beneath his feet, he saw once more the high-bred type of Parisienne, the fragile outlines of her form, her exquisite charm, her disdain of the studied effects which did so much to spoil provincial women.","在他脚下的是一块真正的巴黎地毯，他又重见了巴黎女郎的典范，她体态纤弱，姿态优雅，她对刻意打扮不屑一顾，外省的妇女因此可吃了不少苦。"
"Mme. de Beauseant had fair hair and dark eyes, and the pale complexion that belongs to fair hair.","德鲍赛昂夫人金发黑眼，皮肤和所有的金发女郎一样白皙。"
"She held up her brow nobly like some fallen angel, grown proud through the fall, disdainful of pardon.","她高贵地抬起额头，如同被贬的天使，以自己的过失为荣，不愿寻求宽恕。"
"Her way of gathering her thick hair into a crown of plaits above the broad, curving lines of the bandeaux upon her forehead, added to the queenliness of her face.","她将浓密的头发结成辨髻，盘在额前又宽又弯的发环上面，更增加了她如女皇般的威严。"
"Imagination could discover the ducal coronet of Burgundy in the spiral threads of her golden hair; all the courage of her house seemed to gleam from the great lady’s brilliant eyes, such courage as women use to repel audacity or scorn, for they were full of tenderness for gentleness.","想象丰富的人可以把她如螺旋丝般缠绕的金发想象成是勃艮第家族的公爵宝冠；家族的所有勇气似乎闪烁在这位伟大女性的明眸里，而这种女人身上的勇气只是用来抵御胆大妄为和轻蔑之徒，对于亲切温和之人，这些却是充满温情的。"
"The outline of that little head, so admirably poised above the long, white throat, the delicate, fine features, the subtle curves of the lips, the mobile face itself, wore an expression of delicate discretion, a faint semblance of irony suggestive of craft and insolence.","小小的头颅与白皙细长的脖颈完美地协调，这精致俊俏的容貌，细润微启的双唇，灵动的面部表情，都保持着一种微妙的审慎表情，一种好似狡猾或者傲慢的讽刺味道。"
"Yet it would have been difficult to refuse forgiveness to those two feminine failings in her; for the lines that came out in her forehead whenever her face was not in repose, like her upward glances (that pathetic trick of manner), told unmistakably of unhappiness, of a passion that had all but cost her her life.","她有两处女性的缺点，只消稍一动弹，额头上就会布满皱纹，就像她高抬的目光（这饱含悲痛的表情），只要想起她那不幸的遭遇，想起那几乎夺去她生命的爱情，就很难不再原谅这些缺点了。"
"A woman, sitting in the great, silent salon, a woman cut off from the rest of the world in this remote little valley, alone, with the memories of her brilliant, happy, and impassioned youth, of continual gaiety and homage paid on all sides, now replaced by the horrors of the void—was there not something in the sight to strike awe that deepened with reflection?","一位女人，坐在宽大、安静的沙发上，远离尘世，独自居住在这偏远的小山谷，只能回忆那曾经光明、幸福和充满激情的年轻时代，那时朝夕欢娱，处处受人恭维。而如今却落得个空虚惆怅——看到此情此景，难道不会令你感到肃然的敬畏吗？稍加思考，这种景象就会更加令人敬畏。"
"Consciousness of her own value lurked in her smile.","她的微笑表明她对自身价值的充分自信。"
"She was neither wife nor mother, she was an outlaw; she had lost the one heart that could set her pulses beating without shame; she had nothing from without to support her reeling soul; she must even look for strength from within, live her own life, cherish no hope save that of forsaken love, which looks forward to Death’s coming, and hastens his lagging footsteps.","她既不是妻子也不是母亲，她被社会所遗弃；她已失去那个令她心动而又不为此感到羞耻的男人；她无法为自己无力的灵魂找到任何慰藉；她只能从自己体内寻求力量，靠自己过活，除了被遗弃的爱之外，别无任何希望，也就是等待着死亡的到来，加速死亡的脚步。"
"And this while life was in its prime.","即便此时生命正值美好。"
"Oh! to feel destined for happiness and to die—never having given nor received it!","哦！觉得自己生来会享福，然后再死去——却从未享过福，也从未给别人以幸福！"
"A woman too!","一个女人啊！"
"What pain was this!","这是怎样的痛苦啊！"
"These thoughts flashing across M. de Nueil’s mind like lightning, left him very humble in the presence of the greatest charm with which woman can be invested.","这些想法如闪电般从德纽埃尔先生的心头划过，在这位被给予最伟大魅力的女人面前，他感到无地自容。"
"The triple aureole of beauty, nobleness, and misfortune dazzled him; he stood in dreamy, almost open-mouthed admiration of the Vicomtesse.","美丽、高贵和不幸这三重光环使他意乱神迷；他不知所措，几乎目瞪口呆地站在那儿，景仰着这位子爵夫人。"
"But he found nothing to say to her.","可是他自己却说不出话来。"
"Mme. de Beauseant, by no means displeased, no doubt, by his surprise, held out her hand with a kindly but imperious gesture; then, summoning a smile to her pale lips, as if obeying, even yet, the woman’s impulse to be gracious:","德鲍赛昂夫人无疑并未因他的惊讶而感到任何不悦，向他和善而又庄严地伸出手来；接着，她苍白的嘴唇上挂起一丝微笑，似乎不忘表现出女性的优雅："
"“I have heard from M. de Champignelles of a message which you have kindly undertaken to deliver, monsieur,” she said.","“我从德尚皮涅勒先生那里听说你出于好意给我带来了一个消息，先生，”她说道,"
"“Can it be from—”","“这消息是来自——”"
"With that terrible phrase Gaston understood, even more clearly than before, his own ridiculous position, the bad taste and bad faith of his behavior towards a woman so noble and so unfortunate.","听到这可怕的话语，加斯东比任何时候都清楚地明白他自己荒谬可笑的处境，他用低级趣味而又奸诈的手段来对待一位如此高贵而又不幸的女人。"
"He reddened.","他脸红了。"
"The thoughts that crowded in upon him could be read in his troubled eyes; but suddenly, with the courage which youth draws from a sense of its own wrongdoing, he gained confidence, and very humbly interrupted Mme. de Beauseant.","从他慌乱的眼神中可以看到这些思想交集在他的心中；可是，突然转念一想，年轻人从犯错误的感觉中汲取了自信的力量，他饱含谦卑地打断了德鲍赛昂夫人。"
"“Madame,” he faltered out, “I do not deserve the happiness of seeing you.","他支支吾吾地说：“夫人，我不配来看你。"
"I have deceived you basely.","我卑鄙地欺骗了你。"
"However strong the motive may have been, it can never excuse the pitiful subterfuge which I used to gain my end.","不论我的动机是多么强烈，也绝不可原谅我为了到您身边所找的任何托词和接口。"
"But, madame, if your goodness will permit me to tell you—”","可是，夫人，如果您大发慈悲允许我告诉你——”"
"The Vicomtesse glanced at M. de Nueil, haughty disdain in her whole manner.","子爵夫人扫了德纽埃尔先生一眼，眼光中充满着傲慢和蔑视。"
"She stretched her hand to the bell and rang it.","她伸过手去，拉响了铃。"
"“Jacques,” she said, “light this gentleman to the door,” and she looked with dignity at the visitor.","她说：“雅克，提灯送客。”她用威严的眼神看着这位来访者。"
"She rose proudly, bowed to Gaston, and then stooped for the fallen volume.","她高傲地站起身，向加斯东鞠了一躬，然后俯身去拾那本掉落的书。"
"If all her movements on his entrance had been caressingly dainty and gracious, her every gesture now was no less severely frigid.","如果说他进门时她的动作都亲切温雅的话，那么现在她的一举一动都充满着冷酷和无情。"
"M. de Nueil rose to his feet, but he stood waiting.","德纽埃尔站起身，可是还站在那里等着。"
"Mme. de Beauseant flung another glance at him.","德鲍赛昂夫人又扫了他一眼。"
"“Well, why do you not go?” she seemed to say.","她似乎在说：“嗯，怎么还不走？”"
"There was such cutting irony in that glance that Gaston grew white as if he were about to faint.","这眼光中满含尖锐的讽刺，让加斯东面色苍白，好像要晕厥一样。"
"Tears came into his eyes, but he would not let them fall, and scorching shame and despair dried them.","泪水涌上眼眶，不过他强忍着，羞耻和绝望将泪水烘干了。"
"He looked back at Madame de Beauseant, and a certain pride and consciousness of his own worth was mingled with his humility; the Vicomtesse had a right to punish him, but ought she to use her right?","他向后瞧了德鲍赛昂夫人一眼，眼神中带些高傲，也有对自己价值的一些肯定，同时也含些谦卑的意味；子爵夫人有权处置他，可是她有必要这样做吗？"
"Then he went out.","然后，他就出去了。"
"As he crossed the ante-chamber, a clear head, and wits sharpened by passion, were not slow to grasp the danger of his situation.","当他越过前厅时，他敏锐的心志以及那由爱情所引发的智慧，都迅速地使他意识到自己处境的危险。"
"“If I leave this house, I can never come back to it again,” he said to himself.","“要是我离开了这间屋子，我就不可能再回来了，”他自言自语道，"
"“The Vicomtesse will always think of me as a fool.","“子爵夫人会一直认为我是个傻瓜。"
"It is impossible that a woman, and such a woman, should not guess the love that she has called forth.","一个女人，像这样一个女人，不可能猜不出她所激起的爱情。"
"Perhaps she feels a little, vague, involuntary regret for dismissing me so abruptly.","也许她感到一点儿轻微的不自觉的遗憾，就把我就这样粗暴地给撵走了。"
"—But she could not do otherwise, and she cannot recall her sentence.","——可是她也不可能，她也不可能收回成命。"
"It rests with me to understand her.”","只有让我去揣摩她的心思。”"
"At that thought Gaston stopped short on the flight of steps with an exclamation; he turned sharply, saying, “I have forgotten something,” and went back to the salon.","想到这里，加斯东突然在石阶上停了下来，大叫一声道：“我忘了件东西。”然后他回到屋里。"
"The lackey, all respect for a baron and the rights of property, was completely deceived by the natural utterance, and followed him.","这位男仆跟在他后面，仆人对于男爵的头衔和地产的神圣权利一向是充满尊敬的，听到加斯东这自然说出的话，便完全上了他的当。"
"Gaston returned quietly and unannounced.","加斯东静静地走了回去，并未通报。"
"The Vicomtesse, thinking that the intruder was the servant, looked up and beheld M. de Nueil.","子爵夫人以为进来的是个仆人，抬起头却看到了德纽埃尔先生。"
"“Jacques lighted me to the door,” he said, with a half-sad smile which dispelled any suspicion of jest in those words, while the tone in which they were spoken went to the heart.","“雅克已经提灯送过我了。”他半带忧郁地微笑着说。这句话完全失去了任何玩笑的意味，而他说这句话的语调已完全打动了对方的心。"
"Mme. de Beauseant was disarmed.","德鲍赛昂夫人心气平和了下来。"
"“Very well, take a seat,” she said.","“很好，请坐吧。”她说道。"
"Gaston eagerly took possession of a chair.","加斯东急忙拉过一把椅子。"
"His eyes were shining with happiness; the Vicomtesse, unable to endure the brilliant light in them, looked down at the book.","他的眼神中泛出幸福的闪耀；子爵夫人，经受不住这熠熠的目光，低下头看着书。"
"She was enjoying a delicious, ever new sensation; the sense of a man’s delight in her presence is an unfailing feminine instinct.","她正享受着这美妙而又永远新鲜的快乐；看到自己的存在是一个男人的幸福，这对女性来说是一种永不磨灭的情感。"
"And then, besides, he had divined her, and a woman is so grateful to the man who has mastered the apparently capricious, yet logical, reasoning of her heart; who can track her thought through the seemingly contradictory workings of her mind, and read the sensations, shy or bold, written in fleeting red, a bewildering maze of coquetry and self-revelation.","而且，他已经猜透了她的心思，女人总是感激一位男子能够理解她内心这种合乎逻辑却又明显反常的怪念头；她总是感激他能够懂得她表面上似乎完全矛盾的思想行为，懂得她羞赧或者大胆时所产生的一闪而逝的情感，这是一种妩媚而又纯真的混合情感。"
"“Madame,” Gaston exclaimed in a low voice, “my blunder you know, but you do not know how much I am to blame.","“夫人，”加斯东低声喊道，“你知道我犯了错，你却不知道我犯了多大的罪过。"
"If you only knew what joy it was to—”","只要你知道我是多么幸福地去——”"
"“Ah! take care,” she said, holding up one finger with an air of mystery, as she put out her hand towards the bell.","“哦，当心啊。”她举起一只手指装出神秘的样子道，然后将手伸向叫仆人的拉铃。"
"The charming gesture, the gracious threat, no doubt called up some sad thought, some memory of the old happy time when she could be wholly charming and gentle without an afterthought; when the gladness of her heart justified every caprice, and put charm into every least movement.","这迷人的姿态、妩媚的威胁，无疑唤起了一些哀思，使她想起了一些往日幸福的回忆，那时候她那么妩媚动人、温文尔雅，却又毫不做作；她内心的幸福使各种反复无常的想法变得正当，使她最微小的动作都显现出魅力。"
"The lines in her forehead gathered between her brows, and the expression of her face grew dark in the soft candle-light.","她眉头紧皱，脸庞在柔和烛光的映照下黯然失色。"
"Then looking across at M. de Nueil gravely but not unkindly, she spoke like a woman who deeply feels the meaning of every word.","她用严肃而不失亲切的眼神看着德纽埃尔先生，她以深知自己话语含义的态度对他说："
"“This is all very ridiculous!","“这一切都可笑之极！"
"Once upon a time, monsieur, when thoughtless high spirits were my privilege, I should have laughed fearlessly over your visit with you.","先生，以前我有权过得轻率痴狂，我能够和你一同毫无畏惧地嘲笑你这样的来访。"
"But now my life is very much changed.","但是如今我的生活已完全改变了。"
"I cannot do as I like, I am obliged to think.","我已经不能再想怎样就怎样了，我必须考虑清楚。"
"What brings you here?","你为什么要来这儿？"
"Is it curiosity?","是出于好奇吗？"
"In that case I am paying dearly for a little fleeting pleasure.","要是那样的话，我只是感觉到一丝稍纵即逝的喜悦。"
"Have you fallen passionately in love already with a woman whom you have never seen, a woman with whose name slander has, of course, been busy?","你是否已经热烈地爱上了一位你从未谋面、受尽诽谤的女人呢？"
"If so, your motive in making this visit is based on disrespect, on an error which accident brought into notoriety.”","如果是这样的话，你这次到访的动机就是基于对我的不尊重，是建立在会使人声名狼藉的错误之上。”"
"She flung her book down scornfully upon the table, then, with a terrible look at Gaston, she went on: “Because I once was weak, must it be supposed that I am always weak?","她恼恨地把书扔到桌子上，带着可怕的眼神看着加斯东，她继续说道：“因为我曾经软弱过，就认为我会永远软弱吗？"
"This is horrible, degrading.","这真可怕，真可耻。"
"Or have you come here to pity me?","要么你就是来这儿可怜我？"
"You are very young to offer sympathy with heart troubles.","你太年轻，无法同情心灵的苦痛。"
"Understand this clearly, sir, that I would rather have scorn than pity.","先生，要清楚地知道这一点，我宁可受嘲讽也不要别人的怜悯。"
"I will not endure compassion from any one.”","我不会容忍任何人的同情。”"
"There was a brief pause.","沉默了片刻。"
"“Well, sir,” she continued (and the face that she turned to him was gentle and sad), “whatever motive induced this rash intrusion upon my solitude, it is very painful to me, you see.","“好吧，先生，”她继续说（她朝他转过脸去，面色温柔而凄切），“无论是什么动机引导你轻率地侵扰了我孤独的寓所，你都深深地伤害了我，你知道的。"
"You are too young to be totally without good feeling, so surely you will feel that this behavior of yours is improper.","你太年轻，也不会完全没有善心，你当然会感觉到你这种行为是不恰当的。"
"I forgive you for it, and, as you see, I am speaking of it to you without bitterness.","我宽恕你，正如你所见，我已经不再严厉地给你说起这事了。"
"You will not come here again, will you?","你不会再来这儿了，是吗？"
"I am entreating when I might command.","我虽然可以命令你，可是我还是向你提出恳求。"
"If you come to see me again, neither you nor I can prevent the whole place from believing that you are my lover, and you would cause me great additional annoyance.","如果你再来找我的话，那么你我都无法让全城的人相信你不是我的情人，你会让我愁上加愁的。"
"You do not mean to do that, I think.”","你不会有意这样做的，我认为。”"
"She said no more, but looked at him with a great dignity which abashed him.","她不再说话了，只是用极其威严的神情看着他，使他感到局促不安。"
"“I have done wrong, madame,” he said, with deep feeling in his voice, “but it was through enthusiasm and thoughtlessness and eager desire of happiness, the qualities and defects of my age.","“我错了，夫人，”他用深情的语气说道，“可是，狂热、鲁莽和对幸福的强烈渴望，在像我这样的年龄，既算是优点，也算是缺点。"
"Now, I understand that I ought not to have tried to see you,” he added; “but, at the same time, the desire was a very natural one”—and, making an appeal to feeling rather than to the intellect, he described the weariness of his enforced exile.","现在，我懂得了我不应该想方设法来看你，”他补充道：“不过，与此同时，我的欲望也是非常自然的”——他设法多用情感少用理智来描述自己不得不想方设法来到这里的苦痛。"
"He drew a portrait of a young man in whom the fires of life were burning themselves out, conveying the impression that here was a heart worthy of tender love, a heart which, notwithstanding, had never known the joys of love for a young and beautiful woman of refinement and taste.","他将自己描述成一位感情炽热的年轻人，教人想到他是个值得被人温柔爱恋的人，可他的却从未体会过对一位举止文雅、品味精细的漂亮女人的爱。"
"He explained, without attempting to justify, his unusual conduct.","他解释了自己反常的举动，却并不想为之辩护。"
"He flattered Mme. de Beauseant by showing that she had realized for him the ideal lady of a young man’s dream, the ideal sought by so many, and so often sought in vain.","他恭维德鲍赛昂夫人，告诉她，她是年轻人梦寐以求的完美女人，是被大多数年轻人所不断追求却又追求不到的理想女郎。"
"Then he touched upon his morning prowlings under the walls of Courcelles, and his wild thoughts at the first sight of the house, till he excited that vague feeling of indulgence which a woman can find in her heart for the follies committed for her sake.","然后他叙述了自己一大清早就在库尔塞勒墙边散步的经历，还谈到了他第一眼看到这所房子时产生的遐想，直到他煽起了女人心中的那种难以言表的宽容情感，而这种情感是女人发觉自己能够激发别人的狂热爱情时总会产生的。"
"An impassioned voice was speaking in the chill solitude; the speaker brought with him a warm breath of youth and the charms of a carefully cultivated mind.","他使她在冷漠的孤寂中听到了热情洋溢的声音；说话者将一位年轻人青春的温暖气息和良好素养所展示出的无比魅力带到了这里。"
"It was so long since Mme. de Beauseant had felt stirred by real feeling delicately expressed, that it affected her very strongly now.","鲍赛昂夫人很久没有遇见如此真实的情感流露，而此刻这种感情却在深深地感动着她。"
"In spite of herself, she watched M. de Nueil’s expressive face, and admired the noble countenance of a soul, unbroken as yet by the cruel discipline of the life of the world, unfretted by continual scheming to gratify personal ambition and vanity.","她不由自主地注视着纽埃尔先生那富有表情的脸，赞赏他灵魂里崇高的面容，这份信心还未曾受到现实世界中残酷教训的破坏，还未被为实现个人的野心和虚荣心而进行的不间断的算计所毁灭。"
"Gaston was in the flower of his youth, he impressed her as a man with something in him, unaware as yet of the great career that lay before him.","加斯东是正值全盛时期的年轻人，他让她感觉到，他还是一个并不知道自己有着远大前途的个性男子。"
"So both these two made reflections most dangerous for their peace of mind, and both strove to conceal their thoughts.","因此，双方的心中都产生了对他们的思想安宁最为危险的想法，而且两者都努力去隐藏这些想法。"
"M. de Nueil saw in the Vicomtesse a rare type of woman, always the victim of her perfections and tenderness; her graceful beauty is the least of her charms for those who are privileged to know the infinite of feeling and thought and goodness in the soul within; a woman whose instinctive feeling for beauty runs through all the most varied expressions of love, purifying its transports, turning them to something almost holy; wonderful secret of womanhood, the exquisite gift that Nature so seldom bestows.","德纽埃尔先生认为子爵夫人是一位罕见的女性，她们总是会成为自身完美和柔情的牺牲品；对于那些认为灵魂深处存在着无穷的感觉、思想和仁爱的人们而言，她们的优美姿态是最次要的魅力；她们对美的本能感觉贯穿于各种千变万化的爱情之中，净化了肉体，并使它们变成几乎神圣的东西；这就是女性所具有的奇特秘密，是大自然很少赐予的珍品。"
"And the Vicomtesse, on her side, listening to the ring of sincerity in Gaston’s voice, while he told of his youthful troubles, began to understand all that grown children of five-and-twenty suffer from diffidence, when hard work has kept them alike from corrupting influences and intercourse with men and women of the world whose sophistical reasoning and experience destroys the fair qualities of youth.","子爵夫人在一边聆听着加斯东真诚的回话，当他告知他年轻时的苦痛时，她便懂得二十五岁的大孩子们所经受的胆怯，寒窗苦读使这些孩子们远离腐朽，没有机会同社会上的人们接触，而这些人总会用强词夺理的论证和经验来破坏年轻人的良好品德。"
"Here was the ideal of a woman’s dreams, a man unspoiled as yet by the egoism of family or success, or by that narrow selfishness which blights the first impulses of honor, devotion, self-sacrifice, and high demands of self; all the flowers so soon wither that enrich at first the life of delicate but strong emotions, and keep alive the loyalty of the heart.","这正是妇女心中的梦中情人，这位男人并没有家庭和财产的利己主义，也没有那种狭隘的自私自利的观念，这种观念在一开始便扼杀荣誉、忠诚、自我牺牲和高标准自我要求等的个人情绪；这些美德的花儿会迅速凋零，它们起初给人生融入细腻而丰富的情感，还能使人心充满正直和忠诚。"
"But these two, once launched forth into the vast of sentiment, went far indeed in theory, sounding the depths in either soul, testing the sincerity of their expressions; only, whereas Gaston’s experiments were made unconsciously, Mme. de Beauseant had a purpose in all that she said.","可是，这两个人，一旦被卷入感情的广袤天地，在理论上就会走得非常遥远，彼此探测灵魂的深度，互相探寻彼此谈话的诚意；尽管加斯东的探索是不自觉的，可德鲍赛昂夫人却对自己的所言心存目的。"
"Bringing her natural and acquired subtlety to the work, she sought to learn M. de Nueil’s opinions by advancing, as far as she could do so, views diametrically opposed to her own.","她利用天生或后天获得的聪明，试图逐步试探纽埃尔先生的看法，她极力这样去做，并且总是会说出和自己意图截然相反的意见。"
"So witty and so gracious was she, so much herself with this stranger, with whom she felt completely at ease, because she felt sure that they should never meet again, that, after some delicious epigram of hers, Gaston exclaimed unthinkingly:","她太机智、太可亲了，对于这个陌生人，她竟感到完全的无所戒备，因为她觉得他们不会再见面了，她讲了一句妙语警句之后，加斯东不禁惊呼了起来："
"“Oh! madame, how could any man have left you?”","“唉呀！夫人，一个男人怎么会丢弃你呢？”"
"The Vicomtesse was silent.","子爵夫人沉默不语。"
"Gaston reddened, he thought that he had offended her; but she was not angry.","加斯东脸红了，他以为冒犯了她；不过子爵夫人并不生气。"
"The first deep thrill of delight since the day of her calamity had taken her by surprise.","这使她吃了一惊，自从那天她遭遇不幸以来，这是她第一次深切地感受到喜悦的激动。"
"The skill of the cleverest roue could not have made the impression that M. de Nueil made with that cry from the heart.","纽埃尔这次发自内心的呼喊所产生的影响，即便最狡猾的放荡鬼运用谋略也是无法做到的。"
"That verdict wrung from a young man’s candor gave her back innocence in her own eyes, condemned the world, laid the blame upon the lover who had left her, and justified her subsequent solitary drooping life.","一位来自年轻人的坦率判决使她重新找回了自己的无辜清白，这个判决谴责了社会，控诉了抛弃她的那个爱人，认为她之后过着的这种孤僻无味的生活是情有可原的。"
"The world’s absolution, the heartfelt sympathy, the social esteem so longed for, and so harshly refused, nay, all her secret desires were given her to the full in that exclamation, made fairer yet by the heart’s sweetest flatteries and the admiration that women always relish eagerly.","她曾经热切地渴盼世人的宽恕、衷心的同情以及社会的尊重，但都被残酷地拒绝了，而且她所有的一切秘密愿望都在他的这一声惊呼中得到了满足，并且这一呼喊还被最甜蜜的谄媚和女士们总是最爱听的赞美映衬得更加动人心魄。"
"He understood her, understood all, and he had given her, as if it were the most natural thing in the world, the opportunity of rising higher through her fall.","他理解她，理解她的一切，他轻松自然地给予了她从跌落中崛起的机会。"
"She looked at the clock.","她看了看钟表。"
"“Ah! madame, do not punish me for my heedlessness.","“啊！夫人，请不要因我的冒昧而惩罚我。"
"If you grant me but one evening, vouchsafe not to shorten it.”","只要您能答应赐我一个晚上，请您赏脸不要缩减时间。”"
"She smiled at the pretty speech.","她微笑地听着这些漂亮话。"
"“Well, as we must never meet again,” she said, “what signifies a moment more or less?","“好吧，既然我们以后不会再见面了，”她说，“多一分钟少一分钟又有何妨呢？"
"If you were to care for me, it would be a pity.”","如果你要关心我，那才是遗憾。”"
"“It is too late now,” he said.","“可惜现在已经晚了。”他说道。"
"“Do not tell me that,” she answered gravely.","“别对我那样说。”她严肃地回答道，"
"“Under any other circumstances I should be very glad to see you.","“无论在任何情况下，我都会很高兴见到你。"
"I will speak frankly, and you will understand how it is that I do not choose to see you again, and ought not to do so.","我要坦率地跟你讲，你就会明白我不想再见到你，也不该见到你是怎么回事了。"
"You have too much magnanimity not to feel that if I were so much as suspected of a second trespass, every one would think of me as a contemptible and vulgar woman; I should be like other women.","你太过宽宏大量，不会感觉不到我要是再犯一次错的话，就会被人怀疑，每个人都会认为我是个粗鄙庸俗的女人；而我应该学着规矩些，像一般的女人那样。"
"A pure and blameless life will bring my character into relief.","我只有过一种单纯、清白的生活，才能为我的人格找些安慰。"
"I am too proud not to endeavor to live like one apart in the world, a victim of the law through my marriage, man’s victim through my love.","我自尊心太强，不得不如世外人一般努力生活在这个世界上，我的婚姻受尽了法律的苦，我的爱受尽了男人的苦。"
"If I were not faithful to the position which I have taken up, then I should deserve all the reproach that is heaped upon me; I should be lowered in my own eyes.","如果我不保持住现有的地位，那么我就会不得不承担压在我身上的种种责难；连我自己都会瞧不起自己。"
"I had not enough lofty social virtue to remain with a man whom I did not love.","我并没有足够崇高的社会道德和我不爱的人长相厮守在一起。"
"I have snapped the bonds of marriage in spite of the law; it was wrong, it was a crime, it was anything you like, but for me the bonds meant death.","我不顾法律的约束扯断了婚姻的束缚；这是一种错误，是一种罪过，随你怎么说，不过对我而言，这束缚就意味着死亡。"
"I meant to live.","我想活下去。"
"Perhaps if I had been a mother I could have endured the torture of a forced marriage of suitability.","也许如果我做了妈妈，我就也许会容忍这强加的婚姻所带给我的痛苦。"
"At eighteen we scarcely know what is done with us, poor girls that we are!","十八岁时，我们几乎并不知道别人让我们做了什么，我们这些可怜的女孩子！"
"I have broken the laws of the world, and the world has punished me; we both did rightly.","我破坏了社会的法律，社会惩罚了我；我们彼此公平地对待。"
"I sought happiness.","我追求幸福。"
"Is it not a law of our nature to seek for happiness?","难道追求幸福不是我们天性么？"
"I was young, I was beautiful...","我那时年轻漂亮……"
"I thought that I had found a nature as loving, as apparently passionate.","我以为我找到了一位钟情的、很显然充满激情的男子。"
"I was loved indeed; for a little while...”","我的确被爱过；只一小会儿……”"
"She paused.","她停顿片刻。"
"“I used to think,” she said, “that no one could leave a woman in such a position as mine.","“我过去常想，”她说道，“没有人会遗弃一位像我当时处境的人的。"
"I have been forsaken; I must have offended in some way.","我被遗弃了；我一定是以什么方式冒犯了他。"
"Yes, in some way, no doubt, I failed to keep some law of our nature, was too loving, too devoted, too exacting—I do not know.","是的，毫无疑问是以某种方式，而我却违背了我们的天性，我太痴情，太投入，太苛求了——我不知道是怎样。"
"Evil days have brought light with them!","苦难的日子也照样有光亮。"
"For a long while I blamed another, now I am content to bear the whole blame.","我很久便开始控诉别人，现在我已甘愿来承担所有的指控。"
"At my own expense, I have absolved that other of whom I once thought I had a right to complain.","我牺牲自己，宽恕了我曾经认为有权控诉的那个男人。"
"I had not the art to keep him; fate has punished me heavily for my lack of skill.","我没想过怎样能留住他；命运因此重重地惩罚了我的笨拙。"
"I only knew how to love; how can one keep oneself in mind when one loves?","我只知道如何去爱；一个人在爱的时候怎样才能想到自我呢？"
"So I was a slave when I should have sought to be a tyrant.","因此当我应该成为暴君时，我却当了奴隶。"
"Those who know me may condemn me, but they will respect me too.","那些知道我的人可能会谴责我，不过他们也会尊重我。"
"Pain has taught me that I must not lay myself open to this a second time.","痛苦的教训告诉我，我不能让自己再冒一次被遗弃的危险了。"
"I cannot understand how it is that I am living yet, after the anguish of that first week of the most fearful crisis in a woman’s life.","在经历了头一周的痛苦之后，这是女人生命中最为可怕的关头，我真不明白为什么自己还活在这个世上。"
"Only from three years of loneliness would it be possible to draw strength to speak of that time as I am speaking now.","只有当独处了三年的孤寂生活，我才有可能像现在这样鼓起勇气谈论那段时光。"
"Such agony, monsieur, usually ends in death; but this—well, it was the agony of death with no tomb to end it.","先生，像这种苦痛的后果往往是死亡；可是——我的结局只是没有坟墓的痛苦死亡罢了。"
"Oh!","哦！"
"I have known pain indeed!”","我已经完全知晓了其中的苦痛！”"
"The Vicomtesse raised her beautiful eyes to the ceiling; and the cornice, no doubt, received all the confidences which a stranger might not hear.","子爵夫人抬起她美丽的眼睛仰望着天花板，还有檐口，毫无疑问，她总是把不愿让陌生人听见的心事向檐口倾诉。"
"When a woman is afraid to look at her interlocutor, there is in truth no gentler, meeker, more accommodating confidant than the cornice.","当一个女人不敢正视她的会话者时，那么檐口就是最温柔、最谦和、最随和的听取她内心秘密的知己了。"
"The cornice is quite an institution in the boudoir; what is it but the confessional, minus the priest?","檐口仿佛是女性闺房中的专设机构；难道我们不该称它为没有神甫的忏悔所吗？"
"Mme. de Beauseant was eloquent and beautiful at that moment; nay, “coquettish,” if the word were not too heavy.","鲍赛昂夫人此刻言辞恳切，美貌动人；而且，如果不怕过分的话，可以说她有些风情妖艳。"
"By justifying herself and love, she was stimulating every sentiment in the man before her; nay, more, the higher she set the goal, the more conspicuous it grew.","通过给予自己和爱情正确的评价，她刺激了眼前这个男人的一切情绪；而且，她设定的目标越高，目标就越发引人注目。"
"At last, when her eyes had lost the too eloquent expression given to them by painful memories, she let them fall on Gaston.","最后，她收起那由于痛苦的回忆而留在眼神中的过分感人的目光，低下头来注视着加斯东。"
"“You acknowledge, do you not, that I am bound to lead a solitary, self-contained life?” she said quietly.","“你承认不承认，我就应该过一种孤独寂寞的生活吗？”她平静地问道。"
"So sublime was she in her reasoning and her madness, that M. de Nueil felt a wild longing to throw himself at her feet; but he was afraid of making himself ridiculous, so he held his enthusiasm and his thoughts in check.","她在理智和疯狂方面都表现得如此崇高，以至于德纽埃尔先生感觉到一种疯狂的渴望，想拜倒在她的脚下；可是他又害怕自己这样做会荒唐可笑，因此他克制住自己的激情和想法。"
"He was afraid, too, that he might totally fail to express them, and in no less terror of some awful rejection on her part, or of her mockery, an apprehension which strikes like ice to the most fervid soul.","他也害怕自己不能够完全清楚地表达自己，害怕遭到她可怕的拒绝或者嘲笑，这种忧惧会使那最为狂热的灵魂如冰般冷却下来。"
"The revulsion which led him to crush down every feeling as it sprang up in his heart cost him the intense pain that diffident and ambitious natures experience in the frequent crises when they are compelled to stifle their longings.","感情冲动时对感情摧残压制，所产生的反应会使他极度痛苦，这种痛苦是缺乏自信和野心勃勃的人在危急关头经常体验到的，因为他们经常被迫抑制自己的渴求。"
"And yet, in spite of himself, he broke the silence to say in a faltering voice:","不过，他依然不顾自我打破了缄默，用支吾的声音说道："
"“Madame, permit me to give way to one of the strongest emotions of my life, and own to all that you have made me feel.","“夫人，请允许我做一件我平生最激动的一件事吧，向你承认你使我体会到的一切。"
"You set the heart in me swelling high!","你让我的心变得高尚伟大！"
"I feel within me a longing to make you forget your mortifications, to devote my life to this, to give you love for all who ever have given you wounds or hate.","我内心有一种渴望，那就是我要用毕生精力来使你忘却你的耻辱，代替那些曾伤害过你或者憎恨过你的人来爱你。"
"But this is a very sudden outpouring of the heart, nothing can justify it to-day, and I ought not—”","可是我的心表露得太过突然，以至于今天还没有什么东西来证明这种表露，我不该——”"
"“Enough, monsieur,” said Mme. de Beauseant; “we have both of us gone too far.","“够了，先生，”德鲍赛昂夫人说道，“我们都走得太远了。"
"By giving you the sad reasons for a refusal which I am compelled to give, I meant to soften it and not to elicit homage.","我不得不拒绝你，我是想告诉你出于伤心的理由，我想有意向你缓和地表达这个意思，而并非是想别人恭维我。"
"Coquetry only suits a happy woman.","卖弄风情仅仅适合幸福的女人。"
"Believe me, we must remain strangers to each other.","相信我，我们必须彼此继续做陌生人。"
"At a later day you will know that ties which must inevitably be broken ought not to be formed at all.”","终有一天你会明白，不可避免要拆散的人，还是不结合为好。”"
"She sighed lightly, and her brows contracted, but almost immediately grew clear again.","她轻叹一声，双眉紧锁，不过很快便又舒展开来。"
"“How painful it is for a woman to be powerless to follow the man she loves through all the phases of his life!","“一个女人如果在一生的各个阶段都无法一直跟循自己所爱的那个男人，那将是多么痛苦的事啊！"
"And if that man loves her truly, his heart must surely vibrate with pain to the deep trouble in hers.","如果那个男人真爱她的话，他的心也必定会和她内心深处的痛楚一起痛苦地回应。"
"Are they not twice unhappy?”","这难道不是双重不幸吗？”"
"There was a short pause.","随后是一小会儿沉默。"
"Then she rose smiling.","然后她笑着站起身。"
"“You little suspected, when you came to Courcelles, that you were to hear a sermon, did you?”","“你来库尔塞勒的时候，没想到会听一通说教吧，是吗？”"
"Gaston felt even further than at first from this extraordinary woman.","加斯东感到自己和这位非凡的女人之间的距离比最初接触时的距离更远了。"
"Was the charm of that delightful hour due after all to the coquetry of the mistress of the house?","那美妙愉快时刻的魅力是因为这个屋子的女主人卖弄风情的结果吗？"
"She had been anxious to display her wit.","她一直急切地渴望施展自己的智慧。"
"He bowed stiffly to the Vicomtesse, and went away in desperation.","他机械地向子爵夫人行了礼，然后无可奈何地走开了。"
"On the way home he tried to detect the real character of a creature supple and hard as a steel spring; but he had seen her pass through so many phases, that he could not make up his mind about her.","走在回家的路上，他试图找出这个女人的真实性格，她的性格如弹簧般又软又硬；不过他见过她的性格经历过各种不同的阶段，以至于他也无法对她有一个确定的判断。"
"The tones of her voice, too, were ringing in his ears; her gestures, the little movements of her head, and the varying expression of her eyes grew more gracious in memory, more fascinating as he thought of them.","她的语调，在他的耳边萦绕；她的姿态，头部轻微的动作以及眼神中变化的表达在记忆中都变得更加优雅，每当他想到它们时，它们就会变得更加迷人。"
"The Vicomtesse’s beauty shone out again for him in the darkness; his reviving impressions called up yet others, and he was enthralled anew by womanly charm and wit, which at first he had not perceived.","子爵夫人的美貌在黑暗中重放异彩；他心中回想的印象一个接一个地纷至沓来，他又重新受到诱惑，向他展示出他开始并未觉察到的女性魅力和才智。"
"He fell to wandering musings, in which the most lucid thoughts grow refractory and flatly contradict each other, and the soul passes through a brief frenzy fit.","他徘徊在沉思中，最清晰的思想也变得难以驾驭，彼此相互冲突起来，灵魂在短期内也变得狂躁不安。"
"Youth only can understand all that lies in the dithyrambic outpourings of youth when, after a stormy siege, of the most frantic folly and coolest common-sense, the heart finally yields to the assault of the latest comer, be it hope, or despair, as some mysterious power determines.","只有年轻人才能懂得这狂热感情流露的内涵，当心灵经过激烈地袭击之后，经历过最狂乱的愚蠢和最冷静的判断之后，它还是屈服于最后一种思想的袭击，这种思想好像受到一种不知名的神秘力量的驱使，要么充满希望，要么充满绝望。"
"At three-and-twenty, diffidence nearly always rules a man’s conduct; he is perplexed with a young girl’s shyness, a girl’s trouble; he is afraid lest he should express his love ill, sees nothing but difficulties, and takes alarm at them; he would be bolder if he loved less, for he has no confidence in himself, and with a growing sense of the cost of happiness comes a conviction that the woman he loves cannot easily be won; perhaps, too, he is giving himself up too entirely to his own pleasure, and fears that he can give none; and when, for his misfortune, his idol inspires him with awe, he worships in secret and afar, and unless his love is guessed, it dies away.","一位23岁的小伙子总会受到自卑情绪的困扰；他对年轻女孩的羞怯和慌乱感到困惑；他害怕不能很好地表达自己的爱，他只看到困难，对此只会惊慌；要是他少爱她一点儿，他的胆子可能会更大一些，因为他对自己没有自信，越是感觉到幸福的价值，越是深信他爱的女人不会轻易地让人得到；也许，他过多地沉迷于自己的快乐中，害怕不能给予对方任何快乐；当他不幸崇拜的偶像令她敬畏，他只会秘密地崇拜，避而远之，如果人家猜不出他的心思，他的爱情也便完蛋了。"
"Then it often happens that one of these dead early loves lingers on, bright with illusions in many a young heart.","这种在许多年轻人心中早早夭折的爱情，往往会历久犹存留在那里，闪烁着幻想的光辉。"
"What man is there but keeps within him these virgin memories that grow fairer every time they rise before him, memories that hold up to him the ideal of perfect bliss?","哪个男人在心里没有过这些纯真的回忆呢？这些回忆每次想起来，都会越想越美，直至最后给他呈现出一幅完美幸福的图画。"
"Such recollections are like children who die in the flower of childhood, before their parents have known anything of them but their smiles.","这些回忆正如那些在如花般年龄时逝去的孩童，父母只是记得他们的微笑。"
"So M. de Nueil came home from Courcelles, the victim of a mood fraught with desperate resolutions.","因此，当德纽埃尔先生从库尔塞勒回到家时，他俨然成了感情的牺牲品，心中充满了各种绝望的情绪。"
"Even now he felt that Mme. de Beauseant was one of the conditions of his existence, and that death would be preferable to life without her.","即便到现在他依然感觉德鲍赛昂夫人是他生活下去的因素之一，没有她的日子，他宁愿去选择死亡。"
"He was still young enough to feel the tyrannous fascination which fully-developed womanhood exerts over immature and impassioned natures; and, consequently, he was to spend one of those stormy nights when a young man’s thoughts travel from happiness to suicide and back again—nights in which youth rushes through a lifetime of bliss and falls asleep from sheer exhaustion.","他依然很年轻，经受不住一位完美女人对幼稚而热情的心灵所施展的无情魅惑；因此，他不得不度过一个暴风雨般的夜晚，在那天晚上，一位年轻人的思想会从幸福到自杀，再从自杀到幸福，循环往复——这些夜晚中年轻人仿佛匆匆经历一生的所有幸福时刻，然后在精疲力竭之后酣然入睡。"
"Fateful nights are they, and the worst misfortune that can happen is to awake a philosopher afterwards.","这些夜晚是决定命运的夜晚，可能发生的最大不幸就是醒来之后，发现自己成为了一个哲学家。"
"M. de Nueil was far too deeply in love to sleep; he rose and betook to inditing letters, but none of them were satisfactory, and he burned them all.","德纽埃尔先生爱得太深以至于无法入眠；他起身写了好几封信，不过没有一封令他满意，便把信又全部烧毁。"
"The next day he went to Courcelles to make the circuit of her garden walls, but he waited till nightfall; he was afraid that she might see him.","第二天，他绕着库尔塞勒的围墙来回走动，一直等到太黑；他怕子爵夫人会看到他。"
"The instinct that led him to act in this way arose out of so obscure a mood of the soul, that none but a young man, or a man in like case, can fully understand its mute ecstasies and its vagaries, matter to set those people who are lucky enough to see life only in its matter-of-fact aspect shrugging their shoulders.","直觉让他这样做，这直觉使心灵变得神秘晦涩，必须是年轻人，或者有相同处境的人，才会真正明白这其中的狂喜和荒诞之处，而这些只会让那些幸运之人耸耸肩，他们只看到生活的实际面。"
"After painful hesitation, Gaston wrote to Mme. de Beauseant.","在经历了痛苦的犹豫之后，加斯东决定给德鲍赛昂夫人写一封信。"
"Here is the letter, which may serve as a sample of the epistolary style peculiar to lovers, a performance which, like the drawings prepared with great secrecy by children for the birthdays of father or mother, is found insufferable by every mortal except the recipients:—","这封信可以被称为专属情人之间运用陈词滥调写情书的模板式样，就像孩子在父亲或母亲过生日时将自己的画作送给父母作为生日礼物一样，除了接受者之外，谁都不喜欢这礼物。内容如下："
"“MADAME,—Your power over my heart, my soul, myself, is so great that my fate depends wholly upon you to-day.","“夫人，——你的力量在我的心头、灵魂和自我之上，这力量是如此巨大，使得我今天的命运已完全掌握在你手中。"
"Do not throw this letter into the fire; be so kind as to read it through.","请不要将这封信销毁；请您大发慈悲读下去。"
"Perhaps you may pardon the opening sentence when you see that it is no commonplace, selfish declaration, but that it expresses a simple fact.","当您看到我的开头句并非陈词滥调和自私的情誓，而只不过是说出了一个简单的事实的话，那么你也许会原谅我这么写。"
"Perhaps you may feel moved, because I ask for so little, by the submission of one who feels himself so much beneath you, by the influence that your decision will exercise upon my life.","也许这会感动你，因为我几乎别无奢求，我完全拜倒在你的脚下，而你的决定却可以影响我的一生。"
"At my age, madame, I only know how to love, I am utterly ignorant of ways of attracting and winning a woman’s love, but in my own heart I know raptures of adoration of her.","在我这样的年纪，我只知道如何去爱，却完全忽视了如何去吸引和赢得女士的芳心，可是，在我的内心深处，我只感觉到爱慕她的阵阵狂喜。"
"I am irresistibly drawn to you by the great happiness that I feel through you; my thoughts turn to you with the selfish instinct which bids us draw nearer to the fire of life when we find it.","你让我感觉到的无比快乐将我无可抗拒地引到你身边；我对你的全部私心将彼此拉近到离我们发现的生命之火更近的地方。"
"I do not imagine that I am worthy of you; it seems impossible that I, young, ignorant, and shy, could bring you one-thousandth part of the happiness that I drink in at the sound of your voice and the sight of you.","我不觉得我能配得上你；年轻、无知而又羞怯的我，甚至都不可能给你带来我在听到你的声音和看到你的面容时所享受到的幸福的千分之一。"
"For me you are the only woman in the world.","对我而言，你是这个世界上唯一的女人。"
"I cannot imagine life without you, so I have made up my mind to leave France, and to risk my life till I lose it in some desperate enterprise, in the Indies, in Africa, I care not where.","我不敢想象没有你的生活，我决心离开法国，拿我的生命去做赌注，直到将生命毁灭在某些不可能成功的事业中，在印度，在非洲，我才不管在哪儿。"
"How can I quell a love that knows no limits save by opposing to it something as infinite?","我如何该用无边无际的东西去镇压那无穷无尽的爱呢？"
"Yet, if you will allow me to hope, not to be yours, but to win your friendship, I will stay.","可是，要是你给我希望，不一定成为你的爱人，哪怕得到你的有意，我也会留下来。"
"Let me come, not so very often, if you require it, to spend a few such hours with you as those stolen hours of yesterday.","请让我来吧，只要你需要，不必太频繁，就像昨天和你偷偷度过的那个把钟头就行。"
"The keen delight of that brief happiness to be cut short at the least over-ardent word from me, will suffice to enable me to endure the boiling torrent in my veins.","这片刻幸福的喜悦只消我说一句过分热情的话就会变得大打折扣，不过这也足够使我血脉贲张了。"
"Have I presumed too much upon your generosity by this entreaty to suffer an intercourse in which all the gain is mine alone?","希望请您接受一笔只对我有利的交易，不知我是否高估了您的慷慨大方呢？"
"You could find ways of showing the world, to which you sacrifice so much, that I am nothing to you; you are so clever and so proud!","你为这个世界做出了很大的牺牲，你也一定会想法向社会表明，我对你而言什么都不是；你是如此聪明、如此骄傲！"
"What have you to fear?","你害怕什么呢？"
"If I could only lay bare my heart to you at this moment, to convince you that it is with no lurking afterthought that I make this humble request!","如果此刻我能向你袒露心扉，说服你，在我这谦卑的要求之下并没有什么不可告人的秘密。"
"Should I have told you that my love was boundless, while I prayed you to grant me friendship, if I had any hope of your sharing this feeling in the depths of my soul?","如果我有希望请您和我一起分享灵魂深处的感情，我怎么会一边请求你给予我友谊，一边又对你说我的爱有多么宽广呢？"
"No, while I am with you, I will be whatever you will, if only I may be with you.","不，当我和你在一起时，你把我当作什么人都可以，只要我和你在一起就好。"
"If you refuse (as you have the power to refuse), I will not utter one murmur, I will go.","如果你拒绝的话（因为你有权拒绝），我不会有一声埋怨，我会离开。"
"And if, at a later day, any other woman should enter into my life, you will have proof that you were right; but if I am faithful till death, you may feel some regret perhaps.","要是，后来有一天，一个女人走进了我的生活，那么就证明你是对的；可是如果我忠于爱情一直到死，你也许会有些遗憾。"
"The hope of causing you a regret will soothe my agony, and that thought shall be the sole revenge of a slighted heart....”","让你感到遗憾，这个希望会减轻我的苦痛，这个想法也会是对你漠不关心我的完全报复……”"
"Only those who have passed through all the exceeding tribulations of youth, who have seized on all the chimeras with two white pinions, the nightmare fancies at the disposal of a fervid imagination, can realize the horrors that seized upon Gaston de Nueil when he had reason to suppose that his ultimatum was in Mme. de Beauseant’s hands.","加斯东·德纽埃尔将这封信送出时，他感到惶恐万分，他明白，自己的命运就握在德鲍赛昂夫人手中了。想要理解这一点，必须要经历过年轻时期的一切超级难关，必须要曾经捕获过长有白色双翼的喀迈拉，经受过噩梦般激烈的想象。"
"He saw the Vicomtesse, wholly untouched, laughing at his letter and his love, as those can laugh who have ceased to believe in love.","他仿佛看到子爵夫人完全无动于衷，正在在嘲笑他的信和他的爱，正如那些不再相信爱情的人一样。"
"He could have wished to have his letter back again.","他真希望把自己的信要回来。"
"It was an absurd letter.","这是一封荒唐的信。"
"There were a thousand and one things, now that he came to think of it, that he might have said, things infinitely better and more moving than those stilted phrases of his, those accursed, sophisticated, pretentious, fine-spun phrases, though, luckily, the punctuation had been pretty bad and the lines shockingly crooked.","有一千零一种想法在头脑中浮现，他觉察到，这些想法要比他写的那些矫揉造作的句子，那些该死的、诡辩的、自命不凡而又精挑细选的句子，不知要优秀和感人多少倍。幸好，他的标点错得相当厉害，字迹也写得歪三扭四。"
"He tried not to think, not to feel; but he felt and thought, and was wretched.","他尽可能不去想，不去感知；可是他感觉到了，也想到了，他痛苦得很。"
"If he had been thirty years old, he might have got drunk, but the innocence of three-and-twenty knew nothing of the resources of opium nor of the expedients of advanced civilization.","要是他30岁的话，他一定会一醉不醒，可是23岁的清纯少年既不知道鸦片的效果也不知道先进文明的各种办法。"
"Nor had he at hand one of those good friends of the Parisian pattern who understand so well how to say Poete, non dolet! by producing a bottle of champagne, or alleviate the agony of suspense by carrying you off somewhere to make a night of it.","他身边也没有巴黎人那样的好朋友，他们会手捧香槟，对你说说“诗人，请勿悲伤！”，或者把你拉出去某个地方狂欢一晚，以减轻你愁疑的痛苦。"
"Capital fellows are they, always in low water when you are in funds, always off to some watering-place when you go to look them up, always with some bad bargain in horse-flesh to sell you; it is true, that when you want to borrow of them, they have always just lost their last louis at play; but in all other respects they are the best fellows on earth, always ready to embark with you on one of the steep down-grades where you lose your time, your soul, and your life!","他们是些最好的朋友，总是在你缺钱时手头拮据，你去找他们，他们总是去了温泉疗养，并且总会有一匹劣马要卖给你；你要管他们借钱，他们总会在博彩中输光最后一个铜板；不过从其他任何方面来讲，他们是世上最好的朋友，随时准备着沿着陡峭的斜坡启程出发，在此期间，你会耗尽时间，精神和生命！"
"At length M. de Nueil received a missive through the instrumentality of Jacques, a letter that bore the arms of Burgundy on the scented seal, a letter written on vellum notepaper.","最终，德纽埃尔先生从雅克手中收到一封信件，这封信件写在一张牛皮纸上，上面盖着勃艮第家族的散发有香气的封印。"
"He rushed away at once to lock himself in, and read and re-read her letter:—","他立即跑进房间，锁上房门，将她的信念了又念："
"“You are punishing me very severely, monsieur, both for the friendliness of my effort to spare you a rebuff, and for the attraction which intellect always has for me.","“先生，我出于好意而不致使你受到严词的拒绝，也是由于一位聪明人士总是会给予我吸引力的原因，可你却如此严厉地惩罚了我。"
"I put confidence in the generosity of youth, and you have disappointed me.","我相信了年轻人的慷慨大度，而你却令我感到失望。"
"And yet, if I did not speak unreservedly (which would have been perfectly ridiculous), at any rate I spoke frankly of my position, so that you might imagine that I was not to be touched by a young soul.","可是，如果你认为我已经对你开诚布公谈话的话（那绝对是极其荒唐可笑的），我至少向你坦言了我的处境，目的是使自己能够远离一位年轻的灵魂。"
"My distress is the keener for my interest in you.","我的悲痛要大于你对我的兴趣。"
"I am naturally tender-hearted and kindly, but circumstances force me to act unkindly.","我生性温柔、善良，可是环境逼迫我不近人情。"
"Another woman would have flung your letter, unread, into the fire; I read it, and I am answering it.","换作别的女人，你的信会连读也不读就付之一炬；我读了，而且我也在给你回信。"
"My answer will make it clear to you that while I am not untouched by the expression of this feeling which I have inspired, albeit unconsciously, I am still far from sharing it, and the step which I am about to take will show you still more plainly that I mean what I say.","我的回答向你证明，即便我对你因为我所产生的感情不是不受感动，虽然是不知不觉，我也绝不会和你一起分享这份感情，我接下来要采取的行动依然会更加明白，我言出必行。"
"I wish besides, to use, for your welfare, that authority, as it were, which you give me over your life; and I desire to exercise it this once to draw aside the veil from your eyes.","为了你好，我还是希望使用一次正如你所赐予我的对你生命的权力，揭开蒙在你双眼的那层面纱。"
"“I am nearly thirty years old, monsieur; you are barely two-and-twenty.","“先生，我都快30了；而你才不过23岁。"
"You yourself cannot know what your thoughts will be at my age.","你自己无论如何不会明白我这个年龄的想法。"
"The vows that you make so lightly to-day may seem a very heavy burden to you then.","你今天轻率的誓言到时候会成为你沉重的负担。"
"I am quite willing to believe that at this moment you would give me your whole life without a regret, you would even be ready to die for a little brief happiness; but at the age of thirty experience will take from you the very power of making daily sacrifices for my sake, and I myself should feel deeply humiliated if I accepted them.","你能毫无怨无悔地为我牺牲全部生命，为了我的些许幸福而随时去死，对此我很愿意相信这是真的；可是当你到了30岁，经验会使你没有力量为我天天做出牺牲，如果我接受了这些牺牲的话，我则会感到羞愧无比。"
"A day would come when everything, even Nature, would bid you leave me, and I have already told you that death is preferable to desertion.","终究会有一天，一切甚至是自然，会强制你离开我，我已经告诉过你，我宁愿选择去死，也不愿意被遗弃。"
"Misfortune has taught me to calculate; as you see, I am arguing perfectly dispassionately.","不幸让我学会了如何打算；你看，我和你争辩时，极其冷静。"
"You force me to tell you that I have no love for you; I ought not to love, I cannot, and I will not.","是你逼迫我非要告诉你，我不爱你；我不该爱你，不能爱你，将来也不会爱你。"
"It is too late to yield, as women yield, to a blind unreasoning impulse of the heart, too late to be the mistress whom you seek.","女人不加思量地屈服于自己的内心冲动，会后悔莫及，若成为了你追求的情妇也将会令人悔迟。"
"My consolations spring from God, not from earth.","我的安慰源自于上帝，而非尘世。"
"Ah, and besides, with the melancholy insight of disappointed love, I read hearts too clearly to accept your proffered friendship.","啊，除此之外，我带着对失望爱情的忧伤见解，对人心已看得很透，因此不能接受你所提出的友谊。"
"It is only instinct.","这只是本能而已。"
"I forgive the boyish ruse, for which you are not responsible as yet.","我原谅你这孩子气的诡计，因为你连责任都还不该负。"
"In the name of this passing fancy of yours, for the sake of your career and my own peace of mind, I bid you stay in your own country; you must not spoil a fair and honorable life for an illusion which, by its very nature, cannot last.","以你这短暂爱情的名义，为了你的前途和我心境的平和，我命令你留在自己的国度；不许你为了一个必定不会持久的幻想而失去一种美好而光荣的生活。"
"At a later day, when you have accomplished your real destiny, in the fully developed manhood that awaits you, you will appreciate this answer of mine, though to-day it may be that you blame its hardness.","尽管现在你可能会骂我这封信的冷酷无情，可是总有一天，当你实现了自己的真正使命，完全具备了男子气概之后，你就会欣赏我的这些话了。"
"You will turn with pleasure to an old woman whose friendship will certainly be sweet and precious to you then; a friendship untried by the extremes of passion and the disenchanting processes of life; a friendship which noble thoughts and thoughts of religion will keep pure and sacred.","到那时，你会发现有一个老妇人仍然是你的朋友，她的友谊甜蜜而珍贵；她饱含爱情的风霜，生活淡定，却并未屈服于生活；她高尚的思想和宗教观念使她纯洁而神圣。"
"Farewell; do my bidding with the thought that your success will bring a gleam of pleasure into my solitude, and only think of me as we think of absent friends.”","再见了；照我说的做，你的成功会使我估计的生活倍感欣慰，不要想念我，要么就如同想念其他朋友一样地想念我。”"
"Gaston de Nueil read the letter, and wrote the following lines:—","加斯东·德纽埃尔读完这封信后，写了下面的话："
"“MADAME,—If I could cease to love you, to take the chances of becoming an ordinary man which you hold out to me, you must admit that I should thoroughly deserve my fate.","“夫人，如果我能够停止爱你，像你说得成为一个普通人的话，那么你一定会承认，我活该倒霉了。"
"No, I shall not do as you bid me; the oath of fidelity which I swear to you shall only be absolved by death.","不，我不会听从你的命令；我会坚持我的忠诚誓言直到死亡。"
"Ah! take my life, unless indeed you do not fear to carry a remorse all through your own—”","啊，把我的命带走吧，除非你不怕在你的生命中徒增责备——”"
"When the man returned from his errand, M. de Nueil asked him with whom he left the note?","男仆送信回来，德纽埃尔先生问他把信交给了谁。"
"“I gave it to Mme. la Vicomtesse herself, sir; she was in her carriage and just about to start.”","“先生，我把它交给了子爵夫人本人；她在马车上，刚好马上要出门。”"
"“For the town?”","“去城里？”"
"“I don’t think so, sir.","“先生，我想不是吧。"
"Mme. la Vicomtesse had post-horses.”","子爵夫人乘的是驿马。”"
"“Ah! then she is going away,” said the Baron.","“哦，那么她要出门，”男爵说道。"
"“Yes, sir,” the man answered.","“是的，先生。”仆人回答道。"
"Gaston de Nueil at once prepared to follow Mme. de Beauseant.","德纽埃尔先生马上收拾一切，追随着德鲍赛昂夫人出门。"
"She led the way as far as Geneva, without a suspicion that he followed.","她驱车直到日内瓦，并没有意识到他一直跟着。"
"And he?","那么他呢？"
"Amid the many thoughts that assailed him during that journey, one all-absorbing problem filled his mind—“Why did she go away?” ","一路途中他心头涌现出千万种思绪，其中充斥在脑海，挥之不去的一个问题就是——“她为什么要离开呢？”"
"Theories grew thickly on such ground for supposition, and naturally he inclined to the one that flattered his hopes—“If the Vicomtesse cares for me, a clever woman would, of course, choose Switzerland, where nobody knows either of us, in preference to France, where she would find censorious critics.”","围绕着这句话延伸出了很多种猜疑，他自然选择了一种最讨他喜欢想法——“要是子爵夫人喜欢我的话，一个聪明的女人一定会选择瑞士这个我们谁都不认识的地方，而不会选择那个她能遇见很多吹毛求疵者的法国。"
"An impassioned lover of a certain stamp would not feel attracted to a woman clever enough to choose her own ground; such women are too clever.","某些热情洋溢的男人不会喜欢一个女人聪明到自己选择场所；这样的女人太过聪明了。"
"However, there is nothing to prove that there was any truth in Gaston’s supposition.","不过，没有任何证据表明加斯东的猜想是正确无误的。"
"The Vicomtesse took a small house by the side of the lake.","子爵夫人在湖边租了一间小屋。"
"As soon as she was installed in it, Gaston came one summer evening in the twilight.","一等她安顿好，加斯东便选择了一个夏季的黄昏前来拜访。"
"Jacques, that flunkey in grain, showed no sign of surprise, and announced @M. le Baron de Nueil@ like a discreet domestic well acquainted with good society.","雅克，那个贵族的仆人，对一切都司空见惯，看到他一点也不感到惊讶，便去通报了德纽埃尔男爵先生的到来。"
"At the sound of the name, at the sight of its owner, Mme. de Beauseant let her book fall from her hands; her surprise gave him time to come close to her, and to say in tones that sounded like music in her ears:","听到名字，看到真人，德鲍赛昂夫人的书从手中掉落了下来；她的惊讶使他有时间走近她的身旁，她用在她听来美如音乐般的声音说道："
"“What a joy it was to me to take the horses that brought you on this journey!”","“我是多么高兴我旅途中所用的马正是把你带到这儿的马！”"
"To have the inmost desires of the heart so fulfilled!","这就实现了心中秘密的愿望啊！"
"Where is the woman who could resist such happiness as this?","哪一个女人能够抵挡住这样的幸福呢？"
"An Italian woman, one of those divine creatures who, psychologically, are as far removed from the Parisian as if they lived at the Antipodes, a being who would be regarded as profoundly immoral on this side of the Alps, an Italian (to resume) made the following comment on some French novels which she had been reading.","意大利女人是属于仙女般可爱的人儿，可她们在心理上却同巴黎女人截然相反，她们被阿尔卑斯山这边的人认为是很不道德的，因为意大利女人在读法国小说的时候作出了如下的评论。"
"“I cannot see,” she remarked, “why these poor lovers take such a time over coming to an arrangement which ought to be the affair of a single morning.” Why should not the novelist take a hint from this worthy lady, and refrain from exhausting the theme and the reader?","“我就不明白，”她评论说，“为什么这些可怜的情郎要花这么多时间来处理只需一个早晨的时间就能处理完毕的事情呢。”为什么那个小说家不能领会这位高贵女郎的意图，缩短一下篇幅，以免使内容枯燥无味，使读者疲惫不堪呢？"
"Some few passages of coquetry it would certainly be pleasant to give in outline; the story of Mme. de Beauseant’s demurs and sweet delayings, that, like the vestal virgins of antiquity, she might fall gracefully, and by lingering over the innocent raptures of first love draw from it its utmost strength and sweetness.","这里当然有几处风流韵事必须要加以大体描述一番；德鲍赛昂夫人的犹豫和迟疑，正如古代贞洁的处女一般，纵然失身也要保全面子，为了是将初恋的纯情快乐尽情地享受，使初恋能够表现出它最强大的力量和最美好的甜蜜。"
"M. de Nueil was at an age when a man is the dupe of these caprices, of the fence which women delight to prolong; either to dictate their own terms, or to enjoy the sense of their power yet longer, knowing instinctively as they do that it must soon grow less.","德纽埃尔先生正是处于这样一种易受这些爱情游戏欺骗的年龄，对女人而言，这种藩篱她们最乐于延长；目的是要么为了守卫她们的权威，要么是想再度延长她们享受权利的时间，因为她们本能地得知自己的权力马上就会越来越削弱。"
"But, after all, these little boudoir protocols, less numerous than those of the Congress of London, are too small to be worth mention in the history of this passion.","不过，毕竟，像这些小小的闺房协议，当然比不过那些伦敦会议的内容那么繁多，因此在这些激情爱情的历史长河中太过渺小，实在是不值一提。"
"For three years Mme. de Beauseant and M. de Nueil lived in the villa on the lake of Geneva.","德鲍赛昂夫人和德纽埃尔先生在日内瓦湖边的别墅中一起居住了三年之久。"
"They lived quite alone, received no visitors, caused no talk, rose late, went out together upon the lake, knew, in short, the happiness of which we all of us dream.","他们独自安静地过活，不接见任何人，从不和人闲话，睡觉起得很晚，一起泛舟游湖，你知道，总之，如我们梦想般地过着幸福的生活。"
"It was a simple little house, with green shutters, and broad balconies shaded with awnings, a house contrived of set purpose for lovers, with its white couches, soundless carpets, and fresh hangings, everything within it reflecting their joy.","这是座简朴的小别墅，有着绿色的百叶窗，宽阔的阳台上遮着布帘，这是专为爱侣准备的屋子，里面摆放着白色沙发，踏上去没有声音的地毯，还有颜色鲜艳的帷幔，这一切都闪烁着欢乐光芒。"
"Every window looked out on some new view of the lake; in the far distance lay the mountains, fantastic visions of changing color and evanescent cloud; above them spread the sunny sky, before them stretched the broad sheet of water, never the same in its fitful changes.","从每个窗子望出去都会看到不同的新鲜景色；远处群山环绕，浮云千变万化，色彩变幻，景致奇异；头顶上阳光明媚，在他们面前是一片宽阔的水面，湖水阵阵变化，闪烁不定。"
"All their surroundings seemed to dream for them, all things smiled upon them.","周围的一切仿佛都在为他们制造梦境，所有的一切都好像在向他们微笑。"
"Then weighty matters recalled M. de Nueil to France.","一件关系重大的事情要求德纽埃尔先生必须回到法国。"
"His father and brother died, and he was obliged to leave Geneva.","他的父亲和哥哥去世了，他必须离开日内瓦。"
"The lovers bought the house; and if they could have had their way, they would have removed the hills piecemeal, drawn off the lake with a siphon, and taken everything away with them.","这对情侣已买下这栋房子；要是可能的话，他们真想将群山粉碎，用吸管吸干湖水，把这一切都统统带走。"
"Mme. de Beauseant followed M. de Nueil.","德鲍赛昂夫人跟随德纽埃尔先生一起回去了。"
"She realized her property, and bought a considerable estate near Manerville, adjoining Gaston’s lands, and here they lived together; Gaston very graciously giving up Manerville to his mother for the present in consideration of the bachelor freedom in which she left him.","她变卖了财产，在玛奈维尔附近购买了一大片地皮，和加斯东的土地毗邻，他们就在那里住下了；加斯东考虑只要母亲给他以自由之身，他便会欣然将玛奈维尔地产的使用权交给她。"
"Mme. de Beauseant’s estate was close to a little town in one of the most picturesque spots in the valley of the Auge.","德鲍赛昂夫人的房子就坐落在一座小城附近，位于奥日河谷最美丽的地段。"
"Here the lovers raised barriers between themselves and social intercourse, barriers which no creature could overleap, and here the happy days of Switzerland were lived over again.","两个情人在他们和社会交际之间设置了鸿沟，任何人都无法逾越的鸿沟，他们又恢复了往日在瑞士生活的幸福美好时光。"
"For nine whole years they knew happiness which it serves no purpose to describe; happiness which may be divined from the outcome of the story by those whose souls can comprehend poetry and prayer in their infinite manifestations.","九年来，他们过着毋庸细数的幸福生活；这样的生活务必会使那些能够理解各种各样形式的诗歌和祈祷的人，猜想到其中的幸福滋味。"
"All this time Mme. de Beauseant’s husband, the present Marquis (his father and elder brother having died), enjoyed the soundest health.","德鲍赛昂夫人的丈夫，现在的侯爵先生（他的父亲和哥哥已经去世），身体非常健康。"
"There is no better aid to life than a certain knowledge that our demise would confer a benefit on some fellow-creature.","要是能确实知道我们的死能够给别的什么人带来幸福的话，那么没有什么原因能够帮助我们更好地坚持活下去了。"
"M. de Beauseant was one of those ironical and wayward beings who, like holders of life-annuities, wake with an additional sense of relish every morning to a consciousness of good health.","德鲍赛昂先生性格执拗，刚愎自用，他和别的享受终身年金的人一样，认为只要每天早晨起床发觉自己精神饱满，便比别人都多一层不能享受的畅快感觉。"
"For the rest, he was a man of the world, somewhat methodical and ceremonious, and a calculator of consequences, who could make a declaration of love as quietly as a lackey announces that “Madame is served.”","至于其他，他是个饱经世故者，做事讲求方法和仪式，精于心计，他对女人倾诉爱情就像仆人平静地说“夫人，开饭了。”"
"This brief biographical notice of his lordship the Marquis de Beauseant is given to explain the reasons why it was impossible for the Marquise to marry M. de Nueil.","这一小段有关德鲍赛昂先生的传记，给大家以解释的目的是想说明侯爵夫人要嫁给德纽埃尔先生是不可能的。"
"So, after a nine years’ lease of happiness, the sweetest agreement to which a woman ever put her hand, M. de Nueil and Mme. de Beauseant were still in a position quite as natural and quite as false as at the beginning of their adventure.","九年的幸福租约，对一位女人来说是她所能签订的最甜美的约定，德纽埃尔先生和德鲍赛昂夫人依然处在一种自开头以来就既自然又虚假的局面里。"
"And yet they had reached a fatal crisis, which may be stated as clearly as any problem in mathematics.","这样的危机如此严重，也许只能用数学才能将它标注清楚。"
"Mme. la Comtesse de Nueil, Gaston’s mother, a strait-laced and virtuous person, who had made the late Baron happy in strictly legal fashion would never consent to meet Mme. de Beauseant.","德纽埃尔伯爵夫人是一位固守道德、品德端正的女人，她曾经完全遵循法律的要求给加斯东的父亲以幸福的生活，不过她从不愿意会见德鲍赛昂夫人。"
"Mme. de Beauseant quite understood that the worthy dowager must of necessity be her enemy, and that she would try to draw Gaston from his unhallowed and immoral way of life.","德鲍赛昂夫人非常明白这位可敬的贵妇必定是她的敌人，于是想尽办法将加斯东从这种不圣洁的、不道德的生活中挽救出来。"
"The Marquise de Beauseant would willingly have sold her property and gone back to Geneva, but she could not bring herself to do it; it would mean that she distrusted M. de Nueil.","德鲍赛昂侯爵夫人本想变卖田产回到日内瓦去，可是她不能这样做；这意味着她对德纽埃尔先生的不信任。"
"Moreover, he had taken a great fancy to this very Valleroy estate, where he was making plantations and improvements.","况且，他对瓦勒卢阿的土地十分的感兴趣，他在那里栽种植物，开垦土地。"
"She would not deprive him of a piece of pleasurable routine-work, such as women always wish for their husbands, and even for their lovers.","她不会剥夺他这种日常工作所带来的幸福，就像女人总是希望她们的丈夫，甚至她们的情人享有这种幸福一样。"
"A Mlle. de la Rodiere, twenty-two years of age, an heiress with a rent-roll of forty thousand livres, had come to live in the neighborhood.","一位芳龄22、名叫德拉·罗迪埃的小姐来到了这个地方，每年有四万里弗赫的年金入账。"
"Gaston always met her at Manerville whenever he was obliged to go thither.","加斯东每次去玛奈维尔去，总能碰到她。"
"These various personages being to each other as the terms of a proportion sum, the following letter will throw light on the appalling problem which Mme. de Beauseant had been trying for the past month to solve:—","这些形形色色的人物排列在那里，就像比例式的数字，鲍赛昂夫人一个月来一直在开动脑筋试图解决这个可怕的问题，下面这封信便可以作出解释："
"“My beloved angel, it seems like nonsense, does it not, to write to you when there is nothing to keep us apart, when a caress so often takes the place of words, and words too are caresses?","“我亲爱的天使，这样说简直是废话，没有什么能够使我们分离，我们的爱抚常常代替我们的语言，而此刻我给你写信难道不是太不合情理了吗？"
"Ah, well, no, love.","哦，好吧，不，亲爱的。"
"There are some things that a woman cannot say when she is face to face with the man she loves; at the bare thought of them her voice fails her, and the blood goes back to her heart; she has no strength, no intelligence left.","有些事情，一个女人当着她爱人的面是说不出口的；一想到这些事情，她就变得哑口无言，血液就会倒流回心脏；她没有了体力也没有了理智。"
"It hurts me to feel like this when you are near me, and it happens often.","当你在我身边时我感觉如此，而且时有发生，这令我痛苦难过。"
"I feel that my heart should be wholly sincere for you; that I should disguise no thought, however transient, in my heart; and I love the sweet carelessness, which suits me so well, too much to endure this embarrassment and constraint any longer.","我觉得我的心应该完全忠实于你；我不应对你掩饰任何想法，即便是在我心中转瞬即逝的思想；我喜爱这种美妙的无拘无束，这很适合我，我不愿意忍受困窘，变得不自由。"
"So I will tell you about my anguish—yes, it is anguish.","所以我告诉你我的痛苦——是的，痛苦。"
"Listen to me! do not begin with the little ‘Tut, tut, tut,’ that you use to silence me, an impertinence that I love, because anything from you pleases me.","听我说！不要用‘嘘，嘘，嘘，’这种无礼的语调来阻止我说下去，虽然我是爱听你这么说的，因为凡是你说的，无论什么我都喜欢。"
"Dear soul from heaven, wedded to mine, let me first tell you that you have effaced all memory of the pain that once was crushing the life out of me.","亲爱的我的天上佳人，让我先告诉你，过去的生活重压让我痛苦，是你将所有的这些痛苦记忆完全抹去了。"
"I did not know what love was before I knew you.","在我认识你之前，我并不知爱情究竟为何物。"
"Only the candor of your beautiful young life, only the purity of that great soul of yours, could satisfy the requirements of an exacting woman’s heart.","只有你青春靓丽的率真，由你伟大心灵的纯真，才能满足一位苛求少妇的心愿。"
"Dear love, how very often I have thrilled with joy to think that in these nine long, swift years, my jealousy has not been once awakened.","亲爱的，一想到九年来，这漫长而又短暂的九年里，我一次也未曾嫉妒过，我就高兴地发抖。"
"All the flowers of your soul have been mine, all your thoughts.","你把你所有的灵魂之花、所有的思想都给了我。"
"There has not been the faintest cloud in our heaven; we have not known what sacrifice is; we have always acted on the impulses of our hearts.","在我们的天空中不曾有丝毫阴云；我们从来不知道何为牺牲；我们总是按心灵的指示行事。"
"I have known happiness, infinite for a woman.","我也体验了对一个女人来说那最无边的幸福。"
"Will the tears that drench this sheet tell you all my gratitude?","我的泪水湿透了信纸，不知这是否能向你表达我的全部感激之情？"
"I could wish that I had knelt to write the words!—Well, out of this felicity has arisen torture more terrible than the pain of desertion.","我正想跪着写这封信！——这种幸福却令我感觉到比遗弃更可怕的痛苦。"
"Dear, there are very deep recesses in a woman’s heart; how deep in my own heart, I did not know myself until to-day, as I did not know the whole extent of love.","亲爱的，女人的心深不可测；直到今天我也不知道自己心的深度，就像我不知道爱的深度一样。"
"The greatest misery which could overwhelm us is a light burden compared with the mere thought of harm for him whom we love.","只要一想到我们所爱的人所遭受的不幸，我们所承受的最大不幸也就不知轻了多少倍。"
"And how if we cause the harm, is it not enough to make one die?...","要是这些伤害是我们造成的，那不是让我们痛不欲生了吗？"
"This is the thought that is weighing upon me.","这个想法一直压抑着我的思想。"
"But it brings in its train another thought that is heavier far, a thought that tarnishes the glory of love, and slays it, and turns it into a humiliation which sullies life as long as it lasts.","不过这个思想又带来了另一种更加沉重的思想，它会夺去爱情的光耀，扼杀爱情，将它变为耻辱，永远玷污人生。"
"You are thirty years old; I am forty.","你30岁了，而我40岁。"
"What dread this difference in age calls up in a woman who loves!","这样的念头难道不会使一位痴情女人千惶百恐吗！"
"It is possible that, first of all unconsciously, afterwards in earnest, you have felt the sacrifices that you have made by renouncing all in the world for me.","你为我做出了牺牲，抛弃了世间的一切，你起初可能会不自觉地，后来会认真地感觉到这些牺牲的。"
"Perhaps you have thought of your future from the social point of view, of the marriage which would, of course, increase your fortune, and give you avowed happiness and children who would inherit your wealth; perhaps you have thought of reappearing in the world, and filling your place there honorably.","也许你会考虑到你的社交前途、你将来可能的婚姻，当然是能够增加你财产的婚姻，允许你公开承认幸福和能够继承你财产的子女；也许你曾想过要再现于这个世界，从而体面地占据应有的位置。"
"And then, if so, you must have repressed those thoughts, and felt glad to sacrifice heiress and fortune and a fair future to me without my knowledge.","那么，你一定是压制住了这些思想，在我不知情的情况下，欣然牺牲了一个女继承人、一笔财产和一个美好的前途。"
"In your young man’s generosity, you must have resolved to be faithful to the vows which bind us each to each in the sight of God.","你拥有年轻人的慷慨，你决心信守誓言，尽管此誓言仅仅在上帝面前才具有约束力。"
"My past pain has risen up before your mind, and the misery from which you rescued me has been my protection.","过去的痛苦浮现在我的脑海中，你将我从不幸中挽救出的，而这份不幸却已然成了我的保护。"
"To owe your love to your pity!","你爱我完全是出于对我的怜悯！"
"The thought is even more painful to me than the fear of spoiling your life for you.","这个想法比害怕耽误了你一生的想法更让我疼痛难忍啊。"
"The man who can bring himself to stab his mistress is very charitable if he gives her her deathblow while she is happy and ignorant of evil, while illusions are in full blossom....","那些用匕首刺杀他们情妇的人是仁慈的，只要在他们给予致命一击时，情妇们是幸福的、无辜的，是充满幻想的……"
"Yes, death is preferable to the two thoughts which have secretly saddened the hours for several days.","是的，死亡比我这几天暗自悲痛地冒出的两个思想更为可取。"
"To-day, when you asked ‘What ails you?’ so tenderly, the sound of your voice made me shiver.","今天，当你问我‘你有什么心事吗？’你的声音如此温柔，让我不禁战栗。"
"I thought that, after your wont, you were reading my very soul, and I waited for your confidence to come, thinking that my presentiments had come true, and that I had guessed all that was going on in your mind.","我想，按照你的习惯，你定会看穿我的心思，我等待着你说出心里话，想象着我的预感马上变为现实，我以为我已经猜透了你心中的想法。"
"Then I began to think over certain little things that you always do for me, and I thought I could see in you the sort of affection by which a man betrays a consciousness that his loyalty is becoming a burden.","然后我开始想起某些你曾为我做过的点点滴滴，我认为我在你身上看到了一种爱，男人会因此感到忠诚正悄然变成一种负担。"
"And in that moment I paid very dear for my happiness.","那一刻，我觉得我为自己的幸福付出了太大的代价。"
"I felt that Nature always demands the price for the treasure called love.","我觉得大自然总是要为那份所谓爱的珍宝索要价钱。"
"Briefly, has not fate separated us?","一句话，命运不是已经将我们分离了吗？"
"Can you have said, ‘Sooner or later I must leave poor Claire; why not separate in time?’ ","你心里一定会想，‘我迟早会离开可怜的克莱尔；为什么不趁早离开呢？’"
"I read that thought in the depths of your eyes, and went away to cry by myself.","我从你的目光深处看到了这种思想，我离你而去，独自哭泣。"
"Hiding my tears from you!","不让你看到我流泪！"
"the first tears that I have shed for sorrow for these ten years; I am too proud to let you see them, but I did not reproach you in the least.","十年了，我第一次因为悲伤而哭泣；我太骄傲了不愿让你看到泪水，不过我可丝毫没有谴责你的意思。"
"“Yes, you are right.","“是的，你说的有道理。"
"I ought not to be so selfish as to bind your long and brilliant career to my so-soon out-worn life....","我不该如此自私，将你那悠长而光辉的一生和我这即将衰逝生命缠在一起……"
"And yet—how if I have been mistaken?","可是——如果是我错了呢？"
"How if I have taken your love melancholy for a deliberation?","如果我把你忧郁的爱当成是一种从容的思考了呢？"
"Oh, my love, do not leave me in suspense; punish this jealous wife of yours, but give her back the sense of her love and yours; the whole woman lies in that—that consciousness sanctifies everything.","哦，我的爱，不要让我心神不宁啦；惩罚你这嫉妒的妻子吧，可是你必须让她意识到她的爱和你的爱；女人的一切都在于此——这种感情使一切变得神圣起来。"
"“Since your mother came, since you paid a visit to Mlle.","“自从你母亲来后，自从你见到了德拉·罗迪埃小姐以后。"
"de Rodiere, I have been gnawed by doubts dishonoring to us both.","我就一直受到怀疑的折磨，这些怀疑让我丢尽了面子。"
"Make me suffer for this, but do not deceive me; I want to know everything that your mother said and that you think!","让我为此而受苦吧，不过，可不要欺骗我；我想知道你妈对你所说的一切以及你的想法。"
"If you have hesitated between some alternative and me, I give you back your liberty....","如果你在我和某些其他选择之间犹豫不决的话，我会给你自由……"
"I will not let you know what happens to me; I will not shed tears for you to see; only—I will not see you again....","我不会让你知道我的处境；我也不会让你看到我流泪；只不过——我不想再见到你了……"
"Ah! I cannot go on, my heart is breaking..................","啊！我写不下去了，我的心都碎了……"
"I have been sitting  benumbed and stupid for some moments.","我呆呆地僵坐在那里有一阵子。"
"Dear love, I do not find that any feeling of pride rises against you; you are so kind-hearted, so open; you would find it impossible to hurt me or to deceive me; and you will tell me the truth, however cruel it may be.","我的爱人，我找不到任何傲慢之心和你对抗；你是如此善良、坦诚；你是不可能伤害我或者欺骗我的；无论结果有多残酷，你都要告诉我事实的真相。"
"Do you wish me to encourage your confession?","你要我鼓励你说出实话吗？"
"Well, then, heart of mine, I shall find comfort in a woman’s thought.","那么，我的心肝，我会以妇人的思想来寻求慰藉。"
"Has not the youth of your being been mine, your sensitive, wholly gracious, beautiful, and delicate youth?","我不是曾经占有过你的青春吗？你那时机敏、优雅、漂亮而俊秀。"
"No woman shall find henceforth the Gaston whom I have known, nor the delicious happiness that he has given me....","没有哪个女人会再见到我所了解的加斯东，也不会有人能够享受得到他曾带给我的甜蜜幸福。"
"No; you will never love again as you have loved, as you love me now; no, I shall never have a rival, it is impossible.","不，你不会像曾经爱我那样，像现在爱我那样地去爱别人；不，我是绝不会有对手的，这是不可能的。"
"There will be no bitterness in my memories of our love, and I shall think of nothing else.","想到我们的爱，回忆中便不再有痛苦，我也不会再想什么其他的。"
"It is out of your power to enchant any woman henceforth by the childish provocations, the charming ways of a young heart, the soul’s winning charm, the body’s grace, the swift communion of rapture, the whole divine cortege of young love, in fine.","你再也不能用孩子般的撒娇，年轻心灵的迷人魅力，灵魂的内在风情，身体的优雅体态，以及对狂喜的迅速感悟，总之，一个年轻恋人所具备的一切可爱优点，去迷惑别的女人了。"
"“Oh, you are a man now, you will obey your destiny, weighing and considering all things.","“哦，你已经是成人了，你会遵从命运的安排，权衡考虑一切事物。"
"You will have cares, and anxieties, and ambitions, and concerns that will rob her of the unchanging smile that made your lips fair for me.","你会担心、忧虑、野心勃勃、前思后想。这一切会夺去她不变的微笑，而对我而言，这微笑会使你的嘴唇更具美感。"
"The tones that were always so sweet for me will be troubled at times; and your eyes that lighted up with radiance from heaven at the sight of me, will often be lustreless for her.","对我而言，总是那么温柔的语调有时也会变得悲伤；你看到我时的眼睛总是闪烁着天籁之光，对着她可能会经常变得黯然失色。"
"And besides, as it is impossible to love you as I love you, you will never care for that woman as you have cared for me.","还有，那个女人永远不可能像我那样地爱你，你也从来不会像喜欢我一样地去喜欢那个女人。"
"She will never keep a constant watch over herself as I have done; she will never study your happiness at every moment with an intuition which has never failed me.","她不会像我一样总是留心自己的装扮；她也绝不会思考你的幸福，而在这方面我的直觉是绝不会辜负你的。"
"Ah, yes, the man, the heart and soul, which I shall have known will exist no longer.","哦，是的，那个人，他的心灵和灵魂，那个我所熟悉的人，已经不复存在了。"
"I shall bury him deep in my memory, that I may have the joy of him still; I shall live happy in that fair past life of ours, a life hidden from all but our inmost selves.","我将把这一切都埋在记忆的深处，不过我依然会体验到他的快乐；我将幸福地生活在过去的美好时光里，这些日子隐藏在我们的内心深处，没有人知晓。"
"“Dear treasure of mine, if all the while no least thought of liberty has risen in your mind, if my love is no burden on you, if my fears are chimerical, if I am still your Eve—the one woman in the world for you—come to me as soon as you have read this letter, come quickly!","“我亲爱的宝贝，也许你从来没有想过要享受自由，也许爱情对你并非负担，如果我的恐惧只是空想，如果我依然是你的夏娃——对你而言这个世界唯一的女人——那你读完这封信后来到我身边吧，快快来吧！"
"Ah, in one moment I will love you more than I have ever loved you, I think, in these nine years.","啊，这一刻，我想，在这九年里，我比任何时候都更爱你。"
"After enduring the needless torture of these doubts of which I am accusing myself, every added day of love, yes, every single day, will be a whole lifetime of bliss.","我责难自己提出过种种怀疑，忍受了由此产生的无谓痛苦之后，我们的爱情每过一天，是的，只要一天，就等同于幸福的一辈子。"
"So speak, and speak openly; do not deceive me, it would be a crime.","因此说吧，坦率地说吧；不要骗我，那将是一桩罪。"
"Tell me, do you wish for your liberty?","告诉我，你希望我给你自由吗？"
"Have you thought of all that a man’s life means?","你想过真正男人生活的意义吗？"
"Is there any regret in your mind?","你后悔过吗？"
"That I should cause you a regret!","要是我让你后悔过！"
"I should die of it.","我宁愿去死！"
"I have said it: I love you enough to set your happiness above mine, your life before my own.","我曾经说过：我深爱着你，我把你的幸福置于我的幸福之上，把你的生命看得比我的生命更重要。"
"Leave on one side, if you can, the wealth of memories of our nine years’ happiness, that they may not influence your decision, but speak!","如果能的话，把我们九年的幸福时光暂搁一旁，不要让它影响了你的决定，尽管说吧！"
"I submit myself to you as to God, the one Consoler who remains if you forsake me.”","我会像顺从上帝般地顺从你，如果你抛弃了我，那么就只剩下上帝是我唯一的安慰者了。”"
"When Mme. de Beauseant knew that her letter was in M. de Nueil’s hands, she sank in such utter prostration, the over-pressure of many thoughts so numbed her faculties, that she seemed almost drowsy.","德鲍赛昂夫人得知这封信已到达德纽埃尔先生的手中之后，便全身瘫软，精疲力竭，思绪纷乱，如千斤重压使自己失去知觉，看上去昏昏欲睡。"
"At any rate, she was suffering from a pain not always proportioned in its intensity to a woman’s strength; pain which women alone know.","毕竟，她所承受的痛苦，其强烈程度超过了一般妇女所能忍受的限度；此种痛苦只有女人才能感受得到。"
"And while the unhappy Marquise awaited her doom, M. de Nueil, reading her letter, felt that he was “in a very difficult position,” to use the expression that young men apply to a crisis of this kind.","当可怜的侯爵夫人等待着自己的宿命决定时，德纽埃尔先生此刻正读着她的信，用年轻人碰到此类变故时常使用的字眼来说，他的“处境相当尴尬”。"
"By this time he had all but yielded to his mother’s importunities and to the attractions of Mlle. de la Rodiere, a somewhat insignificant, pink-and-white young person, as straight as a poplar.","此刻她已经完全屈服于妈妈的强压和德拉·罗迪埃小姐的吸引力了，这位年轻的小姐平平庸庸，皮肤白里透红，身体如白杨树般僵直。"
"It is true that, in accordance with the rules laid down for marriageable young ladies, she scarcely opened her mouth, but her rent-roll of forty thousand livres spoke quite sufficiently for her.","确实，按照待嫁妇女需遵循的标准而言，她几乎相当于是半个哑巴，不过她每年四万里弗赫的地租已经足以为她说话了。"
"Mme. de Nueil, with a mother’s sincere affection, tried to entangle her son in virtuous courses.","德纽埃尔夫人用妈妈的真挚情感，试图将她的儿子拉回到道德的正路上来。"
"She called his attention to the fact that it was a flattering distinction to be preferred by Mlle. de la Rodiere, who had refused so many great matches; it was quite time, she urged, that he should think of his future, such a good opportunity might not repeat itself, some day he would have eighty thousand livres of income from land; money made everything bearable; if Mme. de Beauseant loved him for his own sake, she ought to be the first to urge him to marry.","她向他指出，能被德拉·罗迪埃小姐选中实在是令人高兴，她可是曾经拒绝过很多的求婚者啊；这正是他要考虑自己前途的时机，她也强烈催促此事，这种时机不可多得，将来总有一天他会拥有八万里弗赫的年息；钱可以安慰一切；如果德·鲍赛昂夫人真心爱他的话，应该第一个敦促他结婚的。"
"In short, the well-intentioned mother forgot no arguments which the feminine intellect can bring to bear upon the masculine mind, and by these means she had brought her son into a wavering condition.","总之，这位善良的母亲没有忘记运用女人能够影响男人理智的所有手段，通过这些方法，她将儿子带入了左右摇摆的境地之中。"
"Mme. de Beauseant’s letter arrived just as Gaston’s love of her was holding out against the temptations of a settled life conformable to received ideas.","德鲍赛昂夫人的信到达的时候，加斯东的爱情正按照世俗的观念与种种诱惑进行着激烈的斗争。"
"That letter decided the day.","这封信决定了斗争的胜负。"
"He made up his mind to break off with the Marquise and to marry.","他决心离开侯爵夫人，跟别人结婚。"
"“One must live a man’s life,” said he to himself.","“人要活得堂堂正正。”他对自己说道。"
"Then followed some inkling of the pain that this decision would give to Mme. de Beauseant.","然后他思忖着他的决定可能会给德鲍赛昂夫人带来什么样的痛苦。"
"The man’s vanity and the lover’s conscience further exaggerated this pain, and a sincere pity for her seized upon him.","男人的虚荣心以及情人的良心将这种痛苦进一步加重，对她的恻隐之心阵阵涌上心头。"
"All at once the immensity of the misery became apparent to him, and he thought it necessary and charitable to deaden the deadly blow.","突然间他感到一种巨大的不幸，他觉得减轻这致命的一击是有必要而且仁慈的举动。"
"He hoped to bring Mme. de Beauseant to a calm frame of mind by gradually reconciling her to the idea of separation; while Mlle. de la Rodiere, always like a shadowy third between them, should be sacrificed to her at first, only to be imposed upon her later.","他想通过使她逐渐习惯分手的念头的方法，希望能够引导德鲍赛昂夫人保持冷静；而且德拉·罗迪埃小姐总是如影子一般地出现在他们中间，开始先牺牲这位小姐，然后再设法让人逼他娶她。"
"His marriage should take place later, in obedience to Mme. de Beauseant’s expressed wish.","他应该随后结婚，这也是顺从了德鲍赛昂夫人的心愿。"
"He went so far as to enlist the Marquise’s nobleness and pride and all the great qualities of her nature to help him to succeed in this compassionate design.","他尽数侯爵夫人的高贵、自尊以及她性格中所有重要的品质，以保证这桩极富同情心的计划得以成功。"
"He would write a letter at once to allay her suspicions.","他便立刻写了一封信来消除她的怀疑。"
"@A letter!@","一封信！"
"For a woman with the most exquisite feminine perception, as well as the intuition of passionate love, a letter in itself was a sentence of death.","对于一个具有最细腻感觉和拥有最热烈爱情直觉的女人而言，信本身就是死亡的判决书。"
"So when Jacques came and brought Mme. de Beauseant a sheet of paper folded in a triangle, she trembled, poor woman, like a snared swallow.","因此当雅克走进来，递给德鲍赛昂夫人一封折成三角的信纸时，她浑身颤抖，像一只被捕的燕子，可怜的女人。"
"A mysterious sensation of physical cold spread from head to foot, wrapping her about in an icy winding sheet.","一股莫名的寒气从头落到脚，如同将她包裹在冰凉的裹尸布里。"
"If he did not rush to her feet, if he did not come to her in tears, and pale, and like a lover, she knew that all was lost.","如果他没有跑过来时跪倒在她的膝下，没有跑过来时像情人一样泪流满面、脸色苍白的话，她就知道大势已去了。"
"And yet, so many hopes are there in the heart of a woman who loves, that she is only slain by stab after stab, and loves on till the last drop of life-blood drains away.","然而，痴情的女人心中总是充满着无数的希望，要拿匕首刺无数次才能将它杀死，不到为爱流尽最后一滴血决不会罢休。"
"“Does madame need anything?” Jacques asked gently, as he went away.","“夫人还需要些什么吗？”雅克离开时轻声地问道。"
"“No,” she said.","“不用了。”她回答。"
"“Poor fellow!” she thought, brushing a tear from her eyes, “he guesses my feelings, servant though he is!”","“可怜的人啊！”她拭去眼角的泪滴想着，“虽是仆人，却也已猜透了我的心思！”"
"She read: “My beloved, you are inventing idle terrors for yourself...” ","她读到：“亲爱的，你真是在自己吓唬自己啊……”"
"The Marquise gazed at the words, and a thick mist spread before her eyes.","子爵夫人盯着这几个字，一层浓雾遮盖住她的双眼。"
"A voice in her heart cried, “He lies!”","在她的心中有一种声音在哭喊：“他撒谎！”"
"—Then she glanced down the page with the clairvoyant eagerness of passion, and read these words at the foot, “Nothing has been decided as yet...” ","——然后她怀着明察秋毫、心急火燎的心情迅速地浏览完信，在这页的下边写着这样一些话，“一切都还没有确定……”"
"Turning to the other side with convulsive quickness, she saw the mind of the writer distinctly through the intricacies of the wording; this was no spontaneous outburst of love.","她抽搐似的迅速翻过一页，从这些错综复杂的措词当中清楚地看出了作者的思想，这再也没有自然迸发的爱情可言了。"
"She crushed it in her fingers, twisted it, tore it with her teeth, flung it in the fire, and cried aloud, “Ah! base that he is!","她用手将信压皱，把它揉成一团，再用牙将其撕碎，投入火中，便号啕大哭起来：“啊！他好卑鄙！"
"I was his, and he had ceased to love me!”","他已不再爱我了，却还想占有我！”"
"She sank half dead upon the couch.","她半死不活地倾倒在长榻上。"
"M. de Nueil went out as soon as he had written his letter.","德纽埃尔先生一写完信后便外出了。"
"When he came back, Jacques met him on the threshold with a note.","当他回来时，雅克手拿一封信站在门口。"
"“Madame la Marquise has left the chateau,” said the man.","“侯爵夫人已经离开了城堡。”他说。"
"M. de Nueil, in amazement, broke the seal and read:—","德纽埃尔先生，很是惊讶，他打开信封读道："
"“MADAME,—If I could cease to love you, to take the chances of becoming an ordinary man which you hold out to me, you must admit that I should thoroughly deserve my fate.","“夫人，——如果我能够停止爱你，像你说得成为一个普通人的话，那么你一定会承认，我就活该倒霉了。"
"No, I shall not do as you bid me; the oath of fidelity which I swear to you shall only be absolved by death.","不，我不会听从你的命令，我会坚持我的忠诚誓言直到死亡。"
"Ah! take my life, unless indeed you do not fear to carry a remorse all through your own...”","啊，把我的命带走吧，除非你不怕在你的生命中徒增责备……”"
"It was his own letter, written to the Marquise as she set out for Geneva nine years before.","这是九年前伯爵夫人动身去日内瓦时他写给她的信。"
"At the foot of it Claire de Bourgogne had written, “Monsieur, you are free.”","在信的下面，克莱尔·德勃艮第写着：“先生，你自由了。”"
"M. de Nueil went to his mother at Manerville.","德纽埃尔先生回到在玛奈维尔的母亲那里。"
"In less than three weeks he married Mlle. Stephanie de la Rodiere.","三个星期不到，他就娶了斯泰法妮德·拉·罗迪埃小姐。"
"If this commonplace story of real life ended here, it would be to some extent a sort of mystification.","如果这真实而又平凡的故事就此结束的话，那么这在一定程度上会给人一种让摸不着头脑的感觉。"
"The first man you meet can tell you a better.","谁也没有比这更有意思的故事可讲了。"
"But the widespread fame of the catastrophe (for, unhappily, this is a true tale), and all the memories which it may arouse in those who have known the divine delights of infinite passion, and lost them by their own deed, or through the cruelty of fate,—these things may perhaps shelter the story from criticism.","不过这个不幸的故事却广为人知（因为，不幸的是，这是个真实的故事），还有，有些人体验过无上爱情非凡快乐的滋味，却又亲手毁灭了这幸福，或者这幸福被残酷的命运破坏了，头脑中产生出无数的回忆，——这些也许都可以使这片故事免受批评。"
"Mme. la Marquise de Beauseant never left Valleroy after her parting from M. de Nueil.","德鲍·赛昂侯爵夫人和德纽埃尔先生分离之后，她根本就没有离开过瓦勒卢阿古堡。"
"After his marriage she still continued to live there, for some inscrutable woman’s reason; any woman is at liberty to assign the one which most appeals to her.","由于种种只能埋藏在女人心中的难以预测的原因，任何一个女人都能想出专属于她们自己的理由，在他结婚之后，伯爵夫人依然继续住在那里。"
"Claire de Bourgogne lived in such complete retirement that none of the servants, save Jacques and her own woman, ever saw their mistress.","克莱尔·德勃艮第过着完全秘密的隐居生活，除了雅克之外，其他任何仆人和贴身女仆都不曾见过她。"
"She required absolute silence all about her, and only left her room to go to the chapel on the Valleroy estate, whither a neighboring priest came to say mass every morning.","她自己需要绝对的安静，除了到瓦勒卢阿的小教堂里去，她闭门不出，只有附近的一位牧师每天清晨来这里为她做弥撒。"
"The Comte de Nueil sank a few days after his marriage into something like conjugal apathy, which might be interpreted to mean happiness or unhappiness equally easily.","结婚之后没几天，德纽埃尔伯爵便陷入了夫妻关系平和的状态之中，这可以解释为幸福，也可以解释为不幸福。"
"“My son is perfectly happy,” his mother said everywhere.","她妈妈无论到哪里都会说：“我儿子相当幸福。”"
"Mme. Gaston de Nueil, like a great many young women, was a rather colorless character, sweet and passive.","加斯东·德纽埃尔夫人，跟许多别的少妇一样，性格有些无趣，温柔和顺从。"
"A month after her marriage she had expectations of becoming a mother.","婚后一个月，她就当妈妈了。"
"All this was quite in accordance with ordinary views.","这一切非常地切合固有的观念。"
"M. de Nueil was very nice to her; but two months after his separation from the Marquise, he grew notably thoughtful and abstracted.","德纽埃尔先生对她非常好；不过和伯爵夫人分手后两个月的时间里，他变得忧心忡忡，心不在焉。"
"But then he always had been serious, his mother said.","可是，他妈妈说，他儿子向来都是不苟言笑的。"
"After seven months of this tepid happiness, a little thing occurred, one of those seemingly small matters which imply such great development of thought and such widespread trouble of the soul, that only the bare fact can be recorded; the interpretation of it must be left to the fancy of each individual mind.","经历了七个月不温不火的幸福生活之后，发生了一件看似无足轻重的小事，然而这种小事却暗示着思想的大发展以及心灵的大烦恼，不能简单地加以叙述；要想解释得清楚就只好任凭人们去随意猜测了。"
"One day, when M. de Nueil had been shooting over the lands of Manerville and Valleroy, he crossed Mme. de Beauseant’s park on his way home, summoned Jacques, and when the man came, asked him, “Whether the Marquise was as fond of game as ever?”","一天，德纽埃尔先生在玛奈维尔和瓦勒卢阿的田野中打猎，回家时穿过德鲍赛昂夫人的花园，他招来雅克，雅克走了过来，便问他，“是不是伯爵夫人还一直喜欢吃野味呢？”"
"Jacques answering in the affirmative, Gaston offered him a good round sum (accompanied by plenty of specious reasoning) for a very little service.","雅克做出肯定的回答，加斯东给了他一大笔钱（外加一大堆似是而非的理由）作为小费，让他帮个小忙。"
"Would he set aside for the Marquise the game that the Count would bring?","他可否把伯爵带来的野味留给侯爵夫人？"
"It seemed to Jacques to be a matter of no great importance whether the partridge on which his mistress dined had been shot by her keeper or by M. de Nueil, especially since the latter particularly wished that the Marquise should know nothing about it.","雅克觉得这女主人吃的山鹑是由她的猎人打的还是由德纽埃尔先生打的并没有多大关系，因为后者特别不希望伯爵夫人知道这些野味的来历。"
"“It was killed on her land,” said the Count, and for some days Jacques lent himself to the harmless deceit.","“这是在她的田里打的。”伯爵说道，而且一连好几天，雅克都参与了这个并无恶意的骗局当中。"
"Day after day M. de Nueil went shooting, and came back at dinner-time with an empty bag.","德纽埃尔先生日复一日地出门打猎，晚饭归来时从来都是两手空空。"
"A whole week went by in this way.","整个星期都是这样度过的。"
"Gaston grew bold enough to write a long letter to the Marquise, and had it conveyed to her.","加斯东胆子大了起来，给侯爵夫人写了一封长信，并设法将信送到她手中。"
"It was returned to him unopened.","信没有打开就退了回来。"
"The Marquise’s servant brought it back about nightfall.","侯爵夫人的仆人给他送回信的时候夜幕已经降临。"
"The Count, sitting in the drawing-room listening, while his wife at the piano mangled a Caprice of Herold’s, suddenly sprang up and rushed out to the Marquise, as if he were flying to an assignation.","伯爵坐在客厅里，听着妻子在钢琴旁刺耳地弹奏着埃拉尔德的随想曲，突然他站起身，向侯爵夫人家急奔过去，就像飞着去赴约一样。"
"He dashed through a well-known gap into the park, and went slowly along the avenues, stopping now and again for a little to still the loud beating of his heart.","他从一处熟悉的缺口跳进花园里，然后沿着径道慢慢地前行，时不时地停下来一小会儿，似乎要压抑一下怦怦的心跳声。"
"Smothered sounds as he came nearer the chateau told him that the servants must be at supper, and he went straight to Mme. de Beauseant’s room.","当他走进古堡时，听了一下周围的声响，断定仆人们在准备晚餐，于是便径直朝德鲍赛昂夫人的房间走了过去。"
"Mme. de Beauseant never left her bedroom.","德鲍赛昂夫人从不离开她的卧室。"
"M. de Nueil could gain the doorway without making the slightest sound.","德纽埃尔先生悄无声息地挨到卧室门口。"
"There, by the light of two wax candles, he saw the thin, white Marquise in a great armchair; her head was bowed, her hands hung listlessly, her eyes gazing fixedly at some object which she did not seem to see.","在那里，透过两只蜡烛的微光，他看到瘦弱苍白的侯爵夫人坐在一张大扶手椅上；她低着头，无精打采地垂下双手，眼睛直勾勾地盯着一件她似乎并看不到的物体。"
"Her whole attitude spoke of hopeless pain.","她的整个姿态表明了她绝望般的痛苦。"
"There was a vague something like hope in her bearing, but it was impossible to say whither Claire de Bourgogne was looking—forwards to the tomb or backwards into the past.","在这样的姿态里，好似有一种如希望般渺茫的事物，谁都不知道克莱尔·德勃艮第是在向着坟墓凝视呢，还是在向过去凝视。"
"Perhaps M. de Nueil’s tears glittered in the deep shadows; perhaps his breathing sounded faintly; perhaps unconsciously he trembled, or again it may have been impossible that he should stand there, his presence unfelt by that quick sense which grows to be an instinct, the glory, the delight, the proof of perfect love.","也许是因为德纽埃尔先生的眼泪在黑暗中闪烁；也许是因为他呼吸出微弱的声响；也许是因为他不自觉地颤抖，或者他站在那里是不可能感觉不到的现象，这种现象已成长为一种本能，光荣，喜悦和真爱的证明。"
"However it was, Mme. de Beauseant slowly turned her face towards the doorway, and beheld her lover of bygone days.","不管怎样，德鲍赛昂夫人慢慢地朝门口转过头来，看到了她往日的情人。"
"Then Gaston de Nueil came forward a few paces.","然后加斯东·德纽埃尔先前走了几步。"
"“If you come any further, sir,” exclaimed the Marquise, growing paler, “I shall fling myself out of the window!”","“先生，如果你再靠近一步”伯爵夫人面色惨白地大声叫道，“我就从窗户跳下去！”"
"She sprang to the window, flung it open, and stood with one foot on the ledge, her hand upon the iron balustrade, her face turned towards Gaston.","她跳到窗前，猛地推开窗户，一只脚踏在窗台上，手扶住铁栏杆，头转过来朝向加斯东。"
"“Go out! go out!” she cried, “or I will throw myself over.”","“出去！出去！”她喊道，“不然我就跳下去。”"
"At that dreadful cry the servants began to stir, and M. de Nueil fled like a criminal.","听到这可怕的哭喊声，仆人们开始骚动起来，德纽埃尔先生像罪犯一样逃跑了。"
"When he reached his home again he wrote a few lines and gave them to his own man, telling him to give the letter himself into Mme. de Beauseant’s hands, and to say that it was a matter of life and death for his master.","他再次回到家里时，他写了几句话，把它交给随身侍仆，告诉他要亲手交到德鲍赛昂夫人手上，并且告诉她这是关于他生死存亡的大事。"
"The messenger went.","信使出去了。"
"M. de Nueil went back to the drawing-room where his wife was still murdering the Caprice, and sat down to wait till the answer came.","德纽埃尔先生回到客厅，妻子依然在糟糕地弹奏那首随想曲，于是坐下来等待回音。"
"An hour later, when the Caprice had come to an end, and the husband and wife sat in silence on opposite sides of the hearth, the man came back from Valleroy and gave his master his own letter, unopened.","一个小时过后，随想曲弹完了，丈夫和妻子各自默默地在壁炉的两端，仆人从瓦勒卢阿回来了，把信原封不动地退回了给主人。"
"M. de Nueil went into a small room beyond the drawing-room, where he had left his rifle, and shot himself.","德纽埃尔先生穿过客厅走进一间放有猎枪的小屋，自杀身亡了。"
"The swift and fatal ending of the drama, contrary as it is to all the habits of young France, is only what might have been expected.","这个突然而致命的结局，跟年轻的法兰西人所习惯的完全相反，不过却是可以预料的。"
"Those who have closely observed, or known for themselves by delicious experience, all that is meant by the perfect union of two beings, will understand Gaston de Nueil’s suicide perfectly well.","那些曾仔细观察过，或者美好地体验过一对男女美满结合的人，会完全理解加斯东·德纽埃尔的自杀行为。"
"A woman does not bend and form herself in a day to the caprices of passion.","一个女人不会在一天之内就按照爱情的无常变化屈服或塑造自己。"
"The pleasure of loving, like some rare flower, needs the most careful ingenuity of culture.","爱的快乐，如一朵奇葩，需要最精心的呵护培养。"
"Time alone, and two souls attuned each to each, can discover all its resources, and call into being all the tender and delicate delights for which we are steeped in a thousand superstitions, imagining them to be inherent in the heart that lavishes them upon us.","只有经历时间，两个彼此结合的灵魂，才能发现快乐的源泉，产生温柔美妙的快乐，我们对它们充满了迷信，认为赐给我们快乐的心灵是与生俱来的。"
"It is this wonderful response of one nature to another, this religious belief, this certainty of finding peculiar or excessive happiness in the presence of one we love, that accounts in part for perdurable attachments and long-lived passion.","这是一种令人赞叹的融合，这种宗教信仰，这种在所爱的人身边所能感受到的奇特或者过分的幸福的确切观念，便是能够长久依恋和永远相爱的部分秘密。"
"If a woman possesses the genius of her sex, love never comes to be a matter of use and wont.","一个女人若拥有女性的天赋，那么爱情对她而言绝不会成为一种生活的习惯。"
"She brings all her heart and brain to love, clothes her tenderness in forms so varied, there is such art in her most natural moments, or so much nature in her art, that in absence her memory is almost as potent as her presence.","她会全心全意地去爱，采取各种不同的温情方式，在她的自然之中融入众多人为的技巧，或者在人为的技巧中增添许多天然的成分，使得她无论在记忆中还是在现实里都那么有影响力。"
"All other women are as shadows compared with her.","别的女人和她相比都会逊色很多。"
"Not until we have lost or known the dread of losing a love so vast and glorious, do we prize it at its just worth.","只有当我们已经失去或者已经知道了失去这么伟大而光荣的爱情的恐惧时，我们才能珍视爱情的应有价值。"
"And if a man who has once possessed this love shuts himself out from it by his own act and deed, and sinks to some loveless marriage; if by some incident, hidden in the obscurity of married life, the woman with whom he hoped to know the same felicity makes it clear that it will never be revived for him; if, with the sweetness of divine love still on his lips, he has dealt a deadly wound to her, his wife in truth, whom he forsook for a social chimera,—then he must either die or take refuge in a materialistic, selfish, and heartless philosophy, from which impassioned souls shrink in horror.","可是如果一个男人曾经拥有过这样的爱情，却又把它抛弃，去选择了一个无爱的婚姻；如果他希望能够在另一个女人身上获得同样的幸福，而这个女人却用隐匿在婚姻生活暗处的某些事件证明，他是不可能得到这幸福的；如果圣洁甜美的爱情还依然沾在他的唇边，而他又为着一个社会的假象深深地伤害了她，他真正的妻子，——那么他就必须要选择死亡或者在那令多情人所憎恶的自私、冷酷的唯利主义哲学中去寻求慰藉。"
"As for Mme. de Beauseant, she doubtless did not imagine that her friend’s despair could drive him to suicide, when he had drunk deep of love for nine years.","至于德鲍赛昂夫人，她绝对不会想到他的朋友会绝望到选择自杀，当年他可是深爱了九年之久啊。"
"Possibly she may have thought that she alone was to suffer.","也许她认为只有她一个人在忍受痛苦。"
"At any rate, she did quite rightly to refuse the most humiliating of all positions; a wife may stoop for weighty social reasons to a kind of compromise which a mistress is bound to hold in abhorrence, for in the purity of her passion lies all its justification.","况且，她完全有权利拒绝所有最为可耻的爱情；一位妻子可以为着重要的社会原因来容忍这种爱情，而一个情妇却痛恨这种勾当，因为对她而言，爱情存在的全部理由在于她爱情的纯洁。"
