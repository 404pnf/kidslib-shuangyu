"The Curious Dream","奇怪的梦"
"by Mark Twain","作者：马克·吐温"
"CONTAINING A MORAL","（包含一种寓意）　　"
"Night before last I had a singular dream.","前天晚上，我做了一个奇怪的梦。"
"I seemed to be sitting on a doorstep (in no particular city perhaps) ruminating, and the time of night appeared to be about twelve or one o’clock.","我梦见自己好像坐在门口的台阶上（或许不在一个特定的城市）沉思。时间大概是深夜12点，或者凌晨1点钟的样子。"
"The weather was balmy and delicious.","天气温和宜人。"
"There was no human sound in the air, not even a footstep.","周围没有人说话的声音，甚至连脚步声都没有。"
"There was no sound of any kind to emphasize the dead stillness, except the occasional hollow barking of a dog in the distance and the fainter answer of a further dog.","除了远处偶尔传来的一只狗的几声沉闷的叫声以及更远处狗的微弱的应和声外，听不到一丝声音，四周一片死寂。"
"Presently up the street I heard a bony clack-clacking, and guessed it was the castanets of a serenading party.","当时在街上，我听到了一种像是骨头摩擦发出的咔咔声，我猜想这是派对上演奏小夜曲时响板发出的声音。"
"In a minute more a tall skeleton, hooded, and half clad in a tattered and moldy shroud, whose shreds were flapping about the ribby latticework of its person, swung by me with a stately stride and disappeared in the gray gloom of the starlight.","不一会儿，我看到一个高大的骷髅，头上戴着风帽，用一块破烂发霉的裹尸布半裹着身子，那些烂布条在他尸衣的格纹布上不停地摆动。他迈着庄严的步伐，从我身边走过，消失在昏暗朦胧的星光里。"
"It had a broken and worm-eaten coffin on its shoulder and a bundle of something in its hand.","他的肩上扛的是一副被虫蛀坏的破烂棺材，手上还有一卷什么东西。"
"I knew what the clack-clacking was then; it was this party’s joints working together, and his elbows knocking against his sides as he walked.","那时，我才知道那咔咔声是怎么回事；原来是这家伙的关节一起活动以及他走路时手肘碰到两侧的骨骼发出的声音。"
"I may say I was surprised.","不得不说，我当时很惊讶。"
"Before I could collect my thoughts and enter upon any speculations as to what this apparition might portend, I heard another one coming for I recognized his clack-clack.","我还没回过神来，没来得及猜测这个鬼怪的出现预示着什么，就听到了另一个人走过来，因为这回我听出了那种咔咔声。"
"He had two-thirds of a coffin on his shoulder, and some foot and head boards under his arm.","他把棺材的三分之二都扛在他的肩上，把棺头和棺尾的木板夹在他的臂下。"
"I mightily wanted, to peer under his hood and speak to him, but when he turned and smiled upon me with his cavernous sockets and his projecting grin as he went by, I thought I would not detain him.","我很想仔细看看他帽子下面的脸孔，同他说几句话，但是当他转过身来，用那深陷的眼窝和满嘴突出的牙齿冲着我笑，走过我身边时，我想我不会留住他。"
"He was hardly gone when I heard the clacking again, and another one issued from the shadowy half-light.","他刚刚走，我又听到了那咔咔声，从昏暗的光线中又走出来一个。"
"This one was bending under a heavy gravestone, and dragging a shabby coffin after him by a string.","这个骷髅背着一块沉重的墓碑，被压得弯下腰来，用一根绳子拖着他身后的一副破烂棺材。"
"When he got to me he gave me a steady look for a moment or two, and then rounded to and backed up to me, saying:","当他走近我时，他定定地看了我一会儿，然后转过身去，背对着我说："
"“Ease this down for a fellow, will you?”","“你能帮我把这个放下来吗？”"
"I eased the gravestone down till it rested on the ground, and in doing so noticed that it bore the name of “John Baxter Copmanhurst,” with “May, 1839,” as the date of his death.","我帮他把那个墓碑拿下来放在地上，放的时候我注意到，墓碑上面刻着“约翰·巴克斯特·科普曼赫斯特”，还有他的卒年“1839年5月”。"
"Deceased sat wearily down by me, and wiped his os frontis with his major maxillary—chiefly from former habit I judged, for I could not see that he brought away any perspiration.","这个亡人疲倦地坐在我身边，用他的上颌骨擦了一下他的前额骨——我估计他这么做主要是出于生前的习惯，因为我没有看到他擦掉一滴汗。"
"“It is too bad, too bad,” said he, drawing the remnant of the shroud about him and leaning his jaw pensively on his hand.","“太糟糕了，太糟糕了！”他一边说，一边拉了拉身上破烂的裹尸布，焦虑地用手托着下巴。"
"Then he put his left foot up on his knee and fell to scratching his anklebone absently with a rusty nail which he got out of his coffin.","然后他把左腿放在右腿膝盖上，用一颗棺材上拔出来的锈钉子，开始心不在焉地刮他的踝骨。"
"“What is too bad, friend?”","“朋友，什么事那么糟糕？”"
"“Oh, everything, everything.","“哦，一切，一切的一切。"
"I almost wish I never had died.”","我真希望自己没死。”"
"“You surprise me.","“你的话令我很吃惊。"
"Why do you say this?","你为什么这么说呢？"
"Has anything gone wrong?","有什么不顺心的事吗？"
"What is the matter?”","究竟是怎么回事？”"
"“Matter!","“怎么回事！"
"Look at this shroud-rags.","瞧瞧这破烂的裹尸布。"
"Look at this gravestone, all battered up.","瞧瞧这块墓碑，都被敲得七零八碎的。"
"Look at that disgraceful old coffin.","再瞧瞧这丢人的破旧棺材。"
"All a man’s property going to ruin and destruction before his eyes, and ask him if anything is wrong?","一个人眼睁睁地看着他的全部家当在他面前毁失殆尽，难道还要问他是不是有什么不顺心的事？"
"Fire and brimstone!”","简直是地狱般的灾难！”"
"“Calm yourself, calm yourself,” I said.","“冷静点儿，冷静点儿，”我说，"
"“It is too bad—it is certainly too bad, but then I had not supposed that you would much mind such matters situated as you are.”","“那太糟糕了，确实是太糟糕了。但是我没有想到，鉴于你现在的处境，也会计较这些东西。”"
"“Well, my dear sir, I do mind them.","“嗯，我亲爱的先生，我确实在意这些。"
"My pride is hurt, and my comfort is impaired—destroyed, I might say.","我的自尊心受到了伤害，我的舒适也受到了破坏——我可以说是被毁了。"
"I will state my case—I will put it to you in such a way that you can comprehend it, if you will let me,” said the poor skeleton, tilting the hood of his shroud back, as if he were clearing for action, and thus unconsciously giving himself a jaunty and festive air very much at variance with the grave character of his position in life—so to speak—and in prominent contrast with his distressful mood.","如果你允许的话，我来讲述我的遭遇——我会用一种你能理解的方式来陈述。”这副可怜的骷髅说着，一面把裹尸布的帽子斜到后边，好像要为陈述作准备一样，所以这让他无意间又流露出一副与他生活中忧郁的性情格格不入的喜悦欢快的神态——也就是说——与他的悲伤的心情形成了鲜明的对比。"
"“Proceed,” said I.","“您继续讲。”我说。"
"“I reside in the shameful old graveyard a block or two above you here, in this street—there, now, I just expected that cartilage would let go!—third rib from the bottom, friend, hitch the end of it to my spine with a string, if you have got such a thing about you, though a bit of silver wire is a deal pleasanter, and more durable and becoming, if one keeps it polished—to think of shredding out and going to pieces in this way, just on account of the indifference and neglect of one’s posterity!”—and the poor ghost grated his teeth in a way that gave me a wrench and a shiver—for the effect is mightily increased by the absence of muffling flesh and cuticle.","“我住在离这儿一两个街区远的那片丢人的旧墓园里，在这条街上——你看，就是那儿。现在我觉得我这块软骨要掉下来了。朋友，从下面数的第三根肋骨，如果你身上有绳子的话，就把它系在这根肋骨的一端，再把另一端系在我的脊骨上。虽然用银线会舒服得多，而且更耐磨也更相称。如果它总是摩擦的话 ——想到用这种方法就觉得肝肠寸断，只是因为子孙们的冷漠忽视！”——那个可怜的鬼魂磨牙发出嘎嘎声，他这个样子让我不禁感到一阵难过和战栗——因为他没有皮肉，他咬牙的样子更加恐怖。"
"“I reside in that old graveyard, and have for these thirty years; and I tell you things are changed since I first laid this old tired frame there, and turned over, and stretched out for a long sleep, with a delicious sense upon me of being done with bother, and grief, and anxiety, and doubt, and fear, forever and ever, and listening with comfortable and increasing satisfaction to the sexton’s work, from the startling clatter of his first spadeful on my coffin till it dulled away to the faint patting that shaped the roof of my new home-delicious!","“我住在那片旧墓园里，住了整整30年了。我告诉你，从我那疲惫衰老的身体第一次躺在那儿起，事情就一直在变化。当我躺下后，翻了个身，伸了个懒腰，准备美美地睡上一觉，心里觉得很轻松，因为我从此将烦恼、伤痛、焦虑、怀疑和恐惧永远地抛在脑后。我可以怀着安逸的、与日俱增的满足感，聆听教堂司事所做的工作，我听到他撒到我棺木上的第一铲土的巨大哗啦声，土越堆越多，成了我新家的屋顶，那拍土的声音变得微弱模糊。"
"My!","哎呀！"
"I wish you could try it to-night!” and out of my reverie deceased fetched me a rattling slap with a bony hand.","我希望今晚你能去试试！”我正沉思时，亡人用他那只瘦骨嶙峋的手，在我身上咔嗒拍了一下。"
"“Yes, sir, thirty years ago I laid me down there, and was happy.","“是的，先生，30年前我躺在那里的时候，我觉得很幸福。"
"For it was out in the country then—out in the breezy, flowery, grand old woods, and the lazy winds gossiped with the leaves, and the squirrels capered over us and around us, and the creeping things visited us, and the birds filled the tranquil solitude with music.","因为当时那里还是乡村——那里微风轻抚，鲜花遍地，古木参天。懒洋洋的风同树叶窃窃私语，松鼠在我们周围嬉戏，爬虫来拜访我们，鸟儿的歌声充满那宁静的山野。"
"Ah, it was worth ten years of a man’s life to be dead then!","啊，那时候，一个人能葬在那儿，就是少活十年也值了！"
"Everything was pleasant.","一切都如此惬意。"
"I was in a good neighborhood, for all the dead people that lived near me belonged to the best families in the city.","我和邻居的关系很好，因为住在我附近的人曾经都生活在这个城市最好的家庭里。"
"Our posterity appeared to think the world of us.","我们的子孙后代似乎极其看重我们。"
"They kept our graves in the very best condition; the fences were always in faultless repair, head-boards were kept painted or whitewashed, and were replaced with new ones as soon as they began to look rusty or decayed; monuments were kept upright, railings intact and bright, the rose-bushes and shrubbery trimmed, trained, and free from blemish, the walks clean and smooth and graveled.","他们把我们的墓碑保护得极好：篱笆总是完好无损，墓前的板子总是涂了漆或刷上了石灰，并且只要一腐蚀或朽坏，就会马上换成新的；墓碑总是竖得笔直，栏杆完好透亮，玫瑰花丛和灌木丛的修建和整枝工作总是无懈可击，围墙光滑整洁，墙上铺满石子。"
"But that day is gone by.","但这样的日子一去不复返了。"
"Our descendants have forgotten us.","我们的后人已经把我们遗忘了。"
"My grandson lives in a stately house built with money made by these old hands of mine, and I sleep in a neglected grave with invading vermin that gnaw my shroud to build them nests withal!","我的孙子住在一所富丽堂皇的房子里，那是用我们的老手赚来的钱建成的，而我却睡在无人问津、害虫侵扰的坟墓里，而且那些害虫还啃噬我的尸衣为它们筑窝！"
"I and friends that lie with me founded and secured the prosperity of this fine city, and the stately bantling of our loves leaves us to rot in a dilapidated cemetery which neighbors curse and strangers scoff at.","我和我的邻居们建设了这座美好的城市，并让它繁荣兴旺，而我们爱的那些乳臭小子却将我们留在这乡邻咒骂、生人耻笑的坟墓里腐烂。"
"See the difference between the old time and this—for instance: Our graves are all caved in now; our head-boards have rotted away and tumbled down; our railings reel this way and that, with one foot in the air, after a fashion of unseemly levity; our monuments lean wearily, and our gravestones bow their heads discouraged; there be no adornments any more—no roses, nor shrubs, nor graveled walks, nor anything that is a comfort to the eye; and even the paintless old board fence that did make a show of holding us sacred from companionship with beasts and the defilement of heedless feet, has tottered till it overhangs the street, and only advertises the presence of our dismal resting-place and invites yet more derision to it.","明白了吧，过去和现在的不同？比如，我们的墓碑现在都倒塌了，棺材顶板已经腐烂倒塌；坟前的栏杆东倒西歪，有一端还翘在空中，完全是一副不体面的、轻率的样子。我们的墓碑疲惫不堪地倾斜着，墓石无精打采地垂着头；没有任何装饰品——没有玫瑰花，没有灌木丛，没有砖石小路，没有任何令人看着舒服的东西；甚至连那些没刷过漆的、破旧的、本该帮我们隔开野兽和免受践踏的篱笆，也已经摇摇欲坠，最后悬垂街头，成为我们坟地的凄凉景象的象征，并因此招致更多的嘲笑。"
"And now we cannot hide our poverty and tatters in the friendly woods, for the city has stretched its withering arms abroad and taken us in, and all that remains of the cheer of our old home is the cluster of lugubrious forest trees that stand, bored and weary of a city life, with their feet in our coffins, looking into the hazy distance and wishing they were there.","现在，我们无法在这友好的森林里掩盖我们的贫穷和衣衫褴褛的寒酸相，因为这座城市已经向四处张开了它毁灭性的臂膀，将我们也包括在其中。我们的老家现在所存留令人欢乐的东西只剩下一丛丛悲伤的树林，它们还站在那里，对城市的生活感动厌倦。它们将根伸入我们的棺材里面，望着朦胧的远方，希望能够生长在那里。"
"I tell you it is disgraceful!","我告诉你，这真是可耻！"
"“You begin to comprehend—you begin to see how it is.","“你开始理解——你开始明白这是怎样一种情形了吧。"
"While our descendants are living sumptuously on our money, right around us in the city, we have to fight hard to keep skull and bones together.","当我们的子孙就在我们周围的这个城市里，用我们的钱过着奢华的生活时，而我们却不得不拼命去保全自己的遗骸。"
"Bless you, there isn’t a grave in our cemetery that doesn’t leak not one.","天哪，我们的墓地里没有一座不漏水的坟墓。"
"Every time it rains in the night we have to climb out and roost in the trees and sometimes we are wakened suddenly by the chilly water trickling down the back of our necks.","在每个下雨的夜晚，我们不得不爬出坟墓，到树上睡觉——有时候，我们会突然被颈背上流下的冰凉的雨水给弄醒。"
"Then I tell you there is a general heaving up of old graves and kicking over of old monuments, and scampering of old skeletons for the trees!","告诉你，到时候旧坟被掀开，墓碑被踢倒在一边，坟里的老骷髅只好匆匆跑到树上去栖息。"
"Bless me, if you had gone along there some such nights after twelve you might have seen as many as fifteen of us roosting on one limb, with our joints rattling drearily and the wind wheezing through our ribs!","哎呀，在这样的一个夜晚，如果你夜晚12点以后到那一带走走，你会看到我们15个人单腿挂在树上，关节发出沉闷的咯吱声，风从我们的肋骨间呼呼地刮过！"
"Many a time we have perched there for three or four dreary hours, and then come down, stiff and chilled through and drowsy, and borrowed each other’s skulls to bail out our graves with—if you will glance up in my mouth now as I tilt my head back, you can see that my head-piece is half full of old dry sediment how top-heavy and stupid it makes me sometimes!","有好多次，我们在树上休息三四个钟头，然后爬下来，全身冻僵，冷彻骨髓，疲惫不已，还要借用彼此头骨来舀出各自坟中的积水——如果我把脑袋后仰，你看一眼我的嘴巴，就会发现我的头颅里有一半已积满陈旧的渣滓，有时候这让我觉得头重脚轻、笨拙不已！"
"Yes, sir, many a time if you had happened to come along just before the dawn you’d have caught us bailing out the graves and hanging our shrouds on the fence to dry.","是的，先生，如果你恰巧多次赶在黎明之前到这边来，你会碰到我们正把坟墓里的水舀出来，还有把尸衣晾在篱笆上。"
"Why, I had an elegant shroud stolen from there one morning—think a party by the name of Smith took it, that resides in a plebeian graveyard over yonder—I think so because the first time I ever saw him he hadn’t anything on but a check shirt, and the last time I saw him, which was at a social gathering in the new cemetery, he was the best-dressed corpse in the company—and it is a significant fact that he left when he saw me; and presently an old woman from here missed her coffin—she generally took it with her when she went anywhere, because she was liable to take cold and bring on the spasmodic rheumatism that originally killed her if she exposed herself to the night air much.","唉，有一天早上，我的一件极好的尸衣在那儿被偷了——我认为是一个叫史密斯的人偷的，他住在那片平民墓地里——我之所以这么认为，是因为我一次见到他的时候，他只有一件格布衬衣。而我最近一次在新墓地的社交聚会上看到的他的时候，他的穿着却是在场所有人中最好的。而另一个值得注意的事实是，他一看到我就走开了。不久，住在这边的一个老妇人的棺材不见了——她走到哪儿都带着它，因为她很容易着凉，然后引发痉挛性风湿病，生前就是这病要了她的命的。"
"She was named Hotchkiss—Anna Matilda Hotchkiss—you might know her?","她的名字叫霍奇基斯——安娜·马蒂尔达·霍奇基斯——也许你认识她？"
"She has two upper front teeth, is tall, but a good deal inclined to stoop, one rib on the left side gone,has one shred of rusty hair hanging from the left side of her head, and one little tuft just above and a little forward of her right ear, has her underjaw wired on one side where it had worked loose, small bone of left forearm gone—lost in a fight has a kind of swagger in her gait and a ‘gallus’ way of going with: her arms akimbo and her nostrils in the air has been pretty free and easy, and is all damaged and battered up till she looks like a queen’s ware crate in ruins—maybe you have met her?”","她有两颗上门牙，个儿挺高，但是背驼的厉害，她左边的肋骨掉了一根；有一缕褪了色的头发垂在她额头的左边，一小撮在头顶上，还有几根在右耳朵前边。她的下颚松动了，用金属线系住一边；左前臂的一小块骨头没了——在一次打斗中没的。她走路时，双手叉腰，昂首阔步，鼻孔外翻，一副盛气凌人的模样——相当肆无忌惮。但是现在，她所有的东西都破了、毁了，看起来就像是废墟里装着女王御用器具的板条箱——说不定你见过她？”"
"“God forbid!”","“但愿没有！”"
"I involuntarily ejaculated, for somehow I was not looking for that form of question, and it caught me a little off my guard.","我无意识地突然叫道，因为我没想过这类问题，而且又有点儿猝不及防。"
"But I hastened to make amends for my rudeness, and say, “I simply meant I had not had the honor—for I would not deliberately speak discourteously of a friend of yours.","但是我马上意识到自己的粗鲁，赶紧赔罪道：“我的意思只是说我没有这个荣幸，因为我不会考虑不周去粗鲁地谈论你的朋友。"
"You were saying that you were robbed—and it was a shame, too—but it appears by what is left of the shroud you have on that it was a costly one in its day.","你刚才说，你的东西被人偷了，实在是太遗憾了——不过这也说明你留下来的那件尸衣，在当时还挺值钱的呢。"
"How did—”","那是怎么——”"
"A most ghastly expression began to develop among the decayed features and shriveled integuments of my guest’s face, and I was beginning to grow uneasy and distressed, when he told me he was only working up a deep, sly smile, with a wink in it, to suggest that about the time he acquired his present garment a ghost in a neighboring cemetery missed one.","我的客人那腐烂皱缩的脸上，开始显现出一种极其可怕的样子，我也开始变得局促不安。而他告诉我他只是露出了一个深沉而狡黠的笑容时，他还眨了眨眼睛，暗示他现在穿的这件衣服，是附近墓地里的一个鬼魂弄丢的。"
"This reassured me, but I begged him to confine himself to speech thenceforth, because his facial expression was uncertain.","我这才打消了疑虑，但是我求他从现在起就用语言和我交流，因为他的面部表情含糊不清。"
"Even with the most elaborate care it was liable to miss fire.","即使他煞费苦心地小心注意，也还是容易失败。"
"Smiling should especially be avoided.","特别是要避免微笑。"
"What he might honestly consider a shining success was likely to strike me in a very different light.","他可能真的认为一次非凡的成功会给我完全不同的感受。"
"I said I liked to see a skeleton cheerful, even decorously playful, but I did not think smiling was a skeleton’s best hold.","我说过，我喜欢看到一副开心的骷髅，甚至是礼貌地开玩笑，不过我觉得微笑并不是骷髅所擅长的。"
"“Yes, friend,” said the poor skeleton, “the facts are just as I have given them to you.","“是的，朋友，”这个可怜的骷髅说道，“我刚才跟你说的那些就是事实。"
"Two of these old graveyards—the one that I resided in and one further along have been deliberately neglected by our descendants of to-day until there is no occupying them any longer.","这里的两个旧墓园——我住的这个和另一个更远一些的，已经被我们的子孙故意忽略了，现在他们不再把这里看成是祖先坟茔。"
"Aside from the osteological discomfort of it—and that is no light matter this rainy weather—the present state of things is ruinous to property.","除了骨头的不舒服外，这里多雨的气候也不是个小问题——这种情形对我们的家当是毁灭性的。"
"We have got to move or be content to see our effects wasted away and utterly destroyed.","我们不得不搬家，或者眼睁睁地看着我们的家当被耗损，然后完全毁坏。"
"“Now, you will hardly believe it, but it is true, nevertheless, that there isn’t a single coffin in good repair among all my acquaintance—now that is an absolute fact.","“现在你肯定很难相信，不过，在我所认识的人中，真的再没有一个人的棺材会得到好的维护修缮——这在眼下是毋庸置疑的。"
"I do not refer to low people who come in a pine box mounted on an express-wagon, but I am talking about your high-toned, silver-mounted burial-case, your monumental sort, that travel under black plumes at the head of a procession and have choice of cemetery lots—I mean folks like the Jarvises, and the Bledsoes and Burlings, and such.","我且不谈那些被装在松木匣子里、用特快四轮马车拉来的下层人民；我要说的是你们这些高尚的、有镶银棺材的、不朽的人物，来的时候行进在一列戴着黑色羽毛饰物的送葬队伍的前面，还可以选择自己的墓地——我的意思是说像贾维斯家族、布莱索家族和伯林家族等等。"
"They are all about ruined.","他们也都会毁灭。"
"The most substantial people in our set, they were.","他们曾是我们之中最富有的人。"
"And now look at them—utterly used up and poverty-stricken.","现在再瞧瞧他们——钱财全部用尽，穷困潦倒。"
"One of the Bledsoes actually traded his monument to a late barkeeper for some fresh shavings to put under his head.","布莱索家族中有人竟真的把墓碑卖给了一个新埋在这里的酒吧老板，为的是换取一些新鲜的刨花垫在头下面。"
"I tell you it speaks volumes, for there is nothing a corpse takes so much pride in as his monument.","我告诉你，这件事的意义非同一般，因为没有哪一个亡人拥有像他那样令人骄傲的墓碑。"
"He loves to read the inscription.","他喜欢读刻在上面的碑文。"
"He comes after a while to believe what it says himself, and then you may see him sitting on the fence night after night enjoying it.","不久，他相信了碑文上说的话，然后你会看到他坐在篱笆上赏读那碑文，夜复一夜。"
"Epitaphs are cheap, and they do a poor chap a world of good after he is dead, especially if he had hard luck while he was alive.","墓志铭很廉价，当一个可怜的家伙死去后，人们就会说一大堆他的好话，特别是对那些生前厄运不断的人。"
"I wish they were used more.","我希望能多有一些墓志铭。"
"Now I don’t complain, but confidentially I do think it was a little shabby in my descendants to give me nothing but this old slab of a gravestone—and all the more that there isn’t a compliment on it.","现在我不是在抱怨，但是我私底下认为，我的子孙只给了我一个破旧的墓碑未免太吝啬了一点儿，更过分的是，墓碑上连句溢美之词都没有。"
"It used to have:","以前只写着:"
"‘GONE TO HIS JUST REWARD’","‘善恶有报’"
"“on it, and I was proud when I first saw it, but by and by I noticed that whenever an old friend of mine came along he would hook his chin on the railing and pull a long face and read along down till he came to that, and then he would chuckle to himself and walk off, looking satisfied and comfortable.","这几个字在上面。当我初次见到这几个字眼时，还觉得很自豪。但是久而久之，我注意到，每次我的老朋友到这儿来，他总要将下巴够在围栏上，拉长着脸从上往下看那碑文。当他看到这几个字，他会不禁嗤笑一声，然后心满意足地走开。"
"So I scratched it off to get rid of those fools.","于是我把那几个字刮掉，来摆脱那群笨蛋。"
"But a dead man always takes a deal of pride in his monument.","但一个死人总是在他的墓碑上获得自豪。"
"Yonder goes half a dozen of the Jarvises now, with the family monument along.","现在那边走着五六个贾维斯家的人，他们都带着家里给他们立的墓碑。"
"And Smithers and some hired specters went by with his awhile ago.","史密瑟斯和一些受雇的鬼魂刚刚带着他的墓碑也从这儿经过。"
"Hello, Higgins, good-by, old friend!","喂，希金斯，再见啦，老朋友！"
"That’s Meredith Higgins—died in ’44—belongs to our set in the cemetery—fine old family—great-grand mother was an Injun—I am on the most familiar terms with him he didn’t hear me was the reason he didn’t answer me.","那是梅雷迪思·希金斯——死于1844年——也住在我们这块墓地，来自一个富裕的古老家族，曾祖母是印第安人。我跟他关系最好，他没答应我是因为他没听到。"
"And I am sorry, too, because I would have liked to introduce you.","而我也很遗憾，因为我很想介绍你认识。"
"You would admire him.","你一定会喜欢他的。"
"He is the most disjointed, sway-backed, and generally distorted old skeleton you ever saw, but he is full of fun.","他是你见过的最混乱、后背最驼、最扭曲的一具老骷髅，但他这个人很有趣。"
"When he laughs it sounds like rasping two stones together, and he always starts it off with a cheery screech like raking a nail across a window-pane.","他的笑声就跟两块石头摩擦发出的声音一样，而他开始发笑的时候，那愉快的尖叫声就像钉子划过窗玻璃似的。"
"Hey, Jones!","嗨，琼斯！"
"That is old Columbus Jones—shroud cost four hundred dollars entire trousseau, including monument, twenty-seven hundred.","那是老哥伦布·琼斯——尸衣花了400美元，全部家当，包括墓碑，一共2700美元。"
"This was in the spring of ’26.","那是1826年春天的事了。"
"It was enormous style for those days.","在那个时候还是很气派的。"
"Dead people came all the way from the Alleghanies to see his things—the party that occupied the grave next to mine remembers it well.","死人们大老远地从阿勒格尼山区来看他的这些东西——葬在我隔壁的那家伙还清楚地记得当时的盛况。"
"Now do you see that individual going along with a piece of a head-board under his arm, one leg-bone below his knee gone, and not a thing in the world on?","你现在看到手臂下夹着顶板的那位了吗？他一条腿骨从膝盖以下没了，身上什么也没穿。"
"That is Barstow Dalhousie, and next to Columbus Jones he was the most sumptuously outfitted person that ever entered our cemetery.","那是巴斯托·达尔豪西，他是我们墓地里穿着的奢华度仅次于哥伦布·琼斯的人。"
"We are all leaving.","我们全都要离开了。"
"We cannot tolerate the treatment we are receiving at the hands of our descendants.","我们无法忍受我们的子孙给我们的这种待遇。"
"They open new cemeteries, but they leave us to our ignominy.","他们开辟新墓地，却让我们忍受这般的耻辱。"
"They mend the streets, but they never mend anything that is about us or belongs to us.","他们修理街道，却对同我们有关或属于我们的东西不闻不问。"
"Look at that coffin of mine—yet I tell you in its day it was a piece of furniture that would have attracted attention in any drawing-room in this city.","看看我的这副棺材——我告诉你，当年在这个城市，无论把它放在哪个客厅都能受到瞩目。"
"You may have it if you want it—I can’t afford to repair it.","你想要的话就拿去吧——我没钱修理它了。"
"Put a new bottom in her, and part of a new top, and a bit of fresh lining along the left side, and you’ll find her about as comfortable as any receptacle of her species you ever tried.","给它换一块新底板，换掉一部分棺盖，再在左边加一些新的内衬，你会发现它同你所试过的任何一类的安睡所一样舒适。"
"No thanks no, don’t mention it you have been civil to me, and I would give you all the property I have got before I would seem ungrateful.","不必谢我，别客气。你对我一直很有礼貌，我要在可能忘恩负义之前，把我所有的财产给你。"
"Now this winding-sheet is a kind of a sweet thing in its way, if you would like to—No?","这件尸衣其实是个好东西，如果你喜欢的话——不要？"
"Well, just as you say, but I wished to be fair and liberal there’s nothing mean about me.","好吧，那随你。我没别的意思，就是想公正无私一点儿。"
"Good-by, friend, I must be going.","朋友，再见，我该走了。"
"I may have a good way to go to-night—don’t know.","也许我今晚能够找到一个好去处，还不知道呢。"
"I only know one thing for certain, and that is that I am on the emigrant trail now, and I’ll never sleep in that crazy old cemetery again.","我能确定的只有一件事，那就是我要搬走了，我再也不用睡在这片疯狂的旧墓地了。"
"I will travel till I fiend respectable quarters, if I have to hoof it to New Jersey.","在找到体面的住所前，即使要徒步走到新泽西，我也会一直走下去。"
"All the boys are going.","所有的男人都要走。"
"It was decided in public conclave, last night, to emigrate, and by the time the sun rises there won’t be a bone left in our old habitations.","昨晚大家秘密商议决定了，我们都要搬走。在太阳升起时，我们的旧居所将连一块骨头都不留下。"
"Such cemeteries may suit my surviving friends, but they do not suit the remains that have the honor to make these remarks.","这样的墓地也许适合我的那些还活着的朋友，可对我们这些剩下的、有幸说这番话的死人却不合适。"
"My opinion is the general opinion.","我的看法就是大家的看法。"
"If you doubt it, go and see how the departing ghosts upset things before they started.","如果你不相信，你可以去看看，那些鬼魂在离开之前，是怎样把东西弄得一团糟的。"
"They were almost riotous in their demonstrations of distaste.","他们在发泄他们的怨恨，几乎都要发动暴动了。"
"Hello, here are some of the Bledsoes, and if you will give me a lift with this tombstone I guess I will join company and jog along with them—mighty respectable old family, the Bledsoes, and used to always come out in six-horse hearses and all that sort of thing fifty years ago when I walked these streets in daylight.","喏，来了几个布莱索家的鬼魂，如果你能帮我把墓碑扛上去，我想我会和他们同行，跟他们一起慢慢走——布莱索家曾经是多么门庭显赫。50年前，我白天走在街上的时候，他们就经常坐六匹马拉的灵车出行。"
"Good-by, friend.”","再见啦，朋友。”"
"And with his gravestone on his shoulder he joined the grisly procession, dragging his damaged coffin after him, for notwithstanding he pressed it upon me so earnestly, I utterly refused his hospitality.","他将墓碑扛在肩上，加入了那支可怕的队伍，他身后拖着那副破烂棺材，虽然他曾热切地劝说我，我还是拒绝接受那副棺材。"
"I suppose that for as much as two hours these sad outcasts went clacking by, laden with their dismal effects, and all that time I sat pitying them.","我猜想大约有两个小时的时间，当那些可怜的无家可归者背负着他们少得可怜的财产咔嗒咔嗒地从我面前走过时，我一直坐在那里，对他们抱着深深的同情。"
"One or two of the youngest and least dilapidated among them inquired about midnight trains on the railways, but the rest seemed unacquainted with that mode of travel, and merely asked about common public roads to various towns and cities, some of which are not on the map now, and vanished from it and from the earth as much as thirty years ago, and some few of them never had existed anywhere but on maps, and private ones in real-estate agencies at that.","他们中有一两个最年轻的、还不是特别悲惨的死人，在铁路上打听夜班火车的情况，但其余的人好像对这种旅行方式还不是很熟悉，只是在询问去各个乡镇和城市的常用道路，有一些路地图上已经找不到了，它们早在30年前就已从地图上消失，实际也已经不存在了，还有极少数的路只是在地图上或是房地产公司的图纸上空有其名。"
"And they asked about the condition of the cemeteries in these towns and cities, and about the reputation the citizens bore as to reverence for the dead.","他们还询问这些乡镇和城市的墓园情况以及当地居民是否尊重死者。"
"This whole matter interested me deeply, and likewise compelled my sympathy for these homeless ones.","我对这整件事很感兴趣，这也激发了我对那些无家可归者的同情。"
"And it all seeming real, and I not knowing it was a dream, I mentioned to one shrouded wanderer an idea that had entered my head to publish an account of this curious and very sorrowful exodus, but said also that I could not describe it truthfully, and just as it occurred, without seeming to trifle with a grave subject and exhibit an irreverence for the dead that would shock and distress their surviving friends.","这一切似乎都是真实的，我并没有觉得这是个梦，于是我同一个裹着尸衣的流浪者提到了我脑海中的一个想法，那就是要将这次奇怪又悲惨的移民写成故事出版。但是我也说了，我的描写不可能完全准确，正如事情本身所发生的这样，似乎我不嘲弄坟墓中的公民，不对死者表现出大不敬，就无法真实地描写出这一切。而我这样做，则会打击到他们那些活着的朋友，让他们感到苦恼。"
"But this bland and stately remnant of a former citizen leaned him far over my gate and whispered in my ear, and said:","但是，这位前公民平和而庄严的遗骸远远地依靠在我的大门口，对着我的耳朵悄声说："
"“Do not let that disturb you.","“别让这件事困扰你。"
"The community that can stand such graveyards as those we are emigrating from can stand anything a body can say about the neglected and forsaken dead that lie in them.”","这个社区群体既然能够忍受我们离开的那种墓地，那么也能够忍受死者对受到的忽视和遗弃的控诉。"
"At that very moment a cock crowed, and the weird procession vanished and left not a shred or a bone behind.","恰在这时，传来了一声公鸡的啼叫，这只奇异的队伍消失得无踪，没有留下一片布屑或一根骨头。"
"I awoke, and found myself lying with my head out of the bed and “sagging” downward considerably—a position favorable to dreaming dreams with morals in them, maybe, but not poetry.","我醒来了，发现自己躺在床上，头垂到床外，而且“向下低垂”得很厉害——正是适合做梦的姿势，梦中可能充满寓意，却毫无诗意可言。"
"NOTE.—The reader is assured that if the cemeteries in his town are kept in good order, this Dream is not leveled at his town at all, but is leveled particularly and venomously at the next town.","注：如果读者所居住的城镇井井有条，那么请放心，这个梦所指的就绝对不是他的城镇，而是专门恶毒地针对其他城镇。"
