"条理乃生意之灵魂。","Method is the soul of business."
"古谚语","OLD SAYING."
"我是个生意人。我是个办事有条理的人。条理毕竟是必需的东西。然而我打心底最看不起的就是你们这些古怪的笨蛋，对条理不求甚解却信口开河地谈论条理；你们只注意条理的字面意思，却违背了它的精神实质。这些人用他们称之为有条理的方式总是做出最离谱的事情。现在我觉得，这绝对是一种自相矛盾的情况。真正的条理只适用于那些平常又显而易见的事情，而不能用于超出常规的事务。我们能为下列说法赋予什么明确的概念呢：“有条不紊的花花公子”，或“讲规则的行踪不定的人”？","I am a business man.I am a methodical man.Method is the thing, after all.But there are no people I more heartily despise than your eccentric fools who prate about method without understanding it; attending strictly to its letter, and violating its spirit.These fellows are always doing the most out-of-the-way things in what they call an orderly manner.Now here, I conceive, is a positive paradox.True method appertains to the ordinary and the obvious alone, and cannot be applied to the outre.What definite idea can a body attach to such expressions as “methodical Jack o’ Dandy,” or “a systematical Will o’ the Wisp”?"
"要不是在我还是小男孩时发生过一件幸运的事，那么我对这个问题的看法也许不会像现在这般清楚。有一天，当我正发出很夸张的吵闹声时，一位好心的爱尔兰老保姆（我在遗嘱里将不会忘记提她的）抓住我的两只脚后跟把我倒提起来，在空中晃悠了一两圈，弄得我这个“吵闹的小坏蛋”眼前一抹黑，然后把我的头重重地撞在了床柱上。我得说，这次撞击决定了我的命运，撞出了我的财运。我的头顶部立刻鼓起了一个包，这个包后来被证明是一个条理器官，人们在夏天会目睹到它的美丽。从此，我对条理和规律的强烈欲望把我造就成一个像现在这样杰出的生意人。","My notions upon this head might not have been so clear as they are, but for a fortunate accident which happened to me when I was a very little boy.A good-hearted old Irish nurse (whom I shall not forget in my will) took me up one day by the heels, when I was making more noise than was necessary, and swinging me round two or three times, d—d my eyes for “a skreeking little spalpeen,” and then knocked my head into a cocked hat against the bedpost.This, I say, decided my fate, and made my fortune.A bump arose at once on my sinciput, and turned out to be as pretty an organ of order as one shall see on a summer’s day.Hence that positive appetite for system and regularity which has made me the distinguished man of business that I am."
"如果说这个世上有什么我憎恶的东西，那就是天才。你们这些天才全都是臭名昭著的蠢才——越是伟大的天才越是彻头彻尾的蠢才——这条规则没有例外。尤其是你不可能把一个天才培养成生意人，就好像你无法从犹太人那里获取钱财，无法从松果里提炼出最佳的肉豆蔻一样。那些天才们经常突然改变想法去从事某种异想天开的生意，或进行某项荒谬可笑的投机，这完全不符合“事物的合理性”，而且他们所做的生意无论如何都不能被认为是生意。因此，你可以凭借他们所从事职业的性质立刻辨认出他们。倘若你发现某人看上去像是商人或制造商，或经营棉花、烟草生意，或处理类似这样的一些不寻常的业务；又或者你看出某人假装是干货商或煮皂工或诸如此类的人；又或者你察觉某人自称为律师、或铁匠、或医生——或从事任何一种不同寻常的工作——你就可以马上把他看成是天才，然后再根据比例运算法判断他为蠢才。","If there is any thing on earth I hate, it is a genius.Your geniuses are all arrant asses—the greater the genius the greater the ass—and to this rule there is no exception whatever.Especially, you cannot make a man of business out of a genius, any more than money out of a Jew, or the best nutmegs out of pine-knots.The creatures are always going off at a tangent into some fantastic employment, or ridiculous speculation, entirely at variance with the “fitness of things,” and having no business whatever to be considered as a business at all.Thus you may tell these characters immediately by the nature of their occupations.If you ever perceive a man setting up as a merchant or a manufacturer, or going into the cotton or tobacco trade, or any of those eccentric pursuits; or getting to be a drygoods dealer, or soap-boiler, or something of that kind; or pretending to be a lawyer, or a blacksmith, or a physician—any thing out of the usual way—you may set him down at once as a genius, and then, according to the rule-of-three, he’s an ass."
"现在无论从哪个方面来看我都不是个天才，而是一个有条不紊的生意人。我的日记账和分类账立刻就能表明这一点。那些账簿我都记录得很清楚，尽管只是我自己这样说；我做事一贯准确、守时，时钟是无法打败我的。此外，我的生意与我同胞们平常的习惯一直都很合拍。在这一点上我并不觉得应该感激我那意志非常薄弱的父母。毋庸置疑，要不是我的守护天使及时前来搭救，最终我肯定会被他们造就成一个彻头彻尾的天才。在传记中，真实是最重要的，而自传里更是容不得半句假话——然而对于我下面陈述的事实，我却几乎不奢望人们能相信我，无论我陈述得多么严肃、郑重：大约在我十五岁的时候，我可怜的父亲将我安排到他称作“做大宗交易的、受人尊敬的五金经销商”的账房里！什么大宗交易，完全是胡扯！然而，这一愚蠢做法导致的后果是，两三天后我不得不被人送回了我那个头脑愚钝的人家里。我发着高烧，头顶上条理器官的周围疼痛至极，十分危险。我差点就没命了——这种危险的状态持续了六个礼拜——医生们已经绝望了，放弃了对我的一切治疗措施。尽管没少遭罪，但是基本上我还是感到很幸运。我终于逃脱了成为一名“做大宗交易的、受人尊敬的五金经销商”的命运。我十分感激我头上的那个包，它就是我的救星，对于那位当初赋予我这颗救星的好心的女人，我也同样感激。","Now I am not in any respect a genius, but a regular business man.My Day-book and Ledger will evince this in a minute.They are well kept, though I say it myself; and, in my general habits of accuracy and punctuality, I am not to be beat by a clock.Moreover, my occupations have been always made to chime in with the ordinary habitudes of my fellowmen.Not that I feel the least indebted, upon this score, to my exceedingly weak-minded parents, who, beyond doubt, would have made an arrant genius of me at last, if my guardian angel had not come, in good time, to the rescue.In biography the truth is every thing, and in autobiography it is especially so—yet I scarcely hope to be believed when I state, however solemnly, that my poor father put me, when I was about fifteen years of age, into the counting-house of what he termed “a respectable hardware and commission merchant doing a capital bit of business!”A capital bit of fiddlestick!However, the consequence of this folly was, that in two or three days, I had to be sent home to my button-headed family in a high state of fever, and with a most violent and dangerous pain in the sinciput, all around about my organ of order.It was nearly a gone case with me then—just touch-and-go for six weeks—the physicians giving me up and all that sort of thing.But, although I suffered much, I was a thankful boy in the main.I was saved from being a “respectable hardware and commission merchant, doing a capital bit of business,” and I felt grateful to the protuberance which had been the means of my salvation, as well as to the kindhearted female who had originally put these means within my reach."
"大多数男孩子到了10岁或12岁便离家出走，可我却一直等到16岁。要不是偶然间听到母亲说要让我自己开一间杂货店，即使到了那个年龄，我也不会觉得我该离开家了呢。杂货店！想象一下吧！我立刻决定离家出走，尝试在某个体面的行业安身立业，不用再奉承这些反复无常的老人的奇怪想法，不用再冒最终被造就成一个天才的危险了。在第一阶段的努力中，我的这一计划极其成功。到了18岁的时侯，我发现自己已经在“为裁缝做活广告”行业做着一份规模很大且有利可图的生意。","The most of boys run away from home at ten or twelve years of age, but I waited till I was sixteen.I don’t know that I should have gone even then, if I had not happened to hear my old mother talk about setting me up on my own hook in the grocery way.The grocery way!—only think of that!I resolved to be off forthwith, and try and establish myself in some decent occupation, without dancing attendance any longer upon the caprices of these eccentric old people, and running the risk of being made a genius of in the end.In this project I succeeded perfectly well at the first effort, and by the time I was fairly eighteen, found myself doing an extensive and profitable business in the Tailor’s Walking-Advertisement line."
"我之所以能够完成这门职业的艰巨任务，完全是凭着严格遵守构成我主要心理特征的规则体系。一种一丝不苟的条理性不仅体现在我的行为上，而且体现在我的账目中。在我看来，能够使人成功的是条理而不是金钱。条理至少能成就雇佣我的那个裁缝所不能成就的东西。我每天上午九点去找那个裁缝取当天需要的服装。十点钟时我就会出现在某个时髦的步行区或其他公共娱乐场所。我精确并有规律地转动我那优雅的身子，以便我身上所穿衣服的每个部分都能让人逐一看清楚，这一点令做这门生意的所有行家都赞叹不已。每天中午之前，我都能成功地把一位顾客带回到我的雇主们名为“先生们，裁剪·欢迎下次光临”的店里。","I was enabled to discharge the onerous duties of this profession, only by that rigid adherence to system which formed the leading feature of my mind.A scrupulous method characterized my actions as well as my accounts.In my case it was method—not money—which made the man: at least all of him that was not made by the tailor whom I served.At nine, every morning, I called upon that individual for the clothes of the day.Ten o’clock found me in some fashionable promenade or other place of public amusement.The precise regularity with which I turned my handsome person about, so as to bring successively into view every portion of the suit upon my back, was the admiration of all the knowing men in the trade.Noon never passed without my bringing home a customer to the house of my employers, Messrs. Cut & Comeagain."
"一说到这点我就感到无比自豪，但眼睛里却泛着泪花——因为这家裁缝店的老板其实是最忘恩负义的无耻之徒。我同他们争吵，最后一拍两散是由于一笔小账。真正熟悉这门生意性质的绅士们不会认为我有任何一项索价过高。然而，我感到自豪和满意的是，在这一点上读者自己可以做出判断。下面是我的账单：","I say this proudly, but with tears in my eyes—for the firm proved themselves the basest of ingrates.The little account, about which we quarreled and finally parted, cannot, in any item, be thought overcharged, by gentlemen really conversant with the nature of the business.Upon this point, however, I feel a degree of proud satisfaction in permitting the reader to judge for himself.My bill ran thus:"
"店铺“先生们，裁剪·欢迎下次光临”是兼售衣料的裁缝店。","Messrs. Cut & Comeagain, Merchant Tailors."

"这张账单上有争议的项目主要是买假衬衫的那两美分，而这个价钱十分合理。我以名誉担保，对于那件假衬衫来说，这个价钱并非过高。那是我所见过的最整洁、最好看的一件小巧的假衬衫；我有充分的理由相信它促进了三件珠皮大衣的销售。然而，裁缝店里那个年长的合伙人只允许我要价一美分，还亲自为我演示如何用一张大页纸做出四个尺寸等大的代用假衬衫。但无须说，我坚持做事的原则。在商言商，做生意就应该有做生意的规矩。想从我这儿骗取一分钱——整整骗走百分之五十——是完全不守章法——没有任何条理可言的。我当即就终止了与“先生们，裁剪·欢迎下次光临”的雇佣关系，独自投身于“眼中钉”这个行业——一种利润最丰厚、最值得尊敬、最不受约束的普通职业。","The item chiefly disputed in this bill was the very moderate charge of two pennies for the dickey.Upon my word of honor, this was not an unreasonable price for that dickey.It was one of the cleanest and prettiest little dickeys I ever saw; and I have good reason to believe that it effected the sale of three Petershams.The elder partner of the firm, however, would allow me only one penny of the charge, and took it upon himself to show in what manner four of the same sized conveniences could be got out of a sheet of foolscap.But it is needless to say that I stood upon the principle of the thing.Business is business, and should be done in a business way.There was no system whatever in swindling me out of a penny—a clear fraud of fifty per cent—no method in any respect.I left at once the employment of Messrs. Cut & Comeagain, and set up in the Eye-Sore line by myself—one of the most lucrative, respectable, and independent of the ordinary occupations.　　"
"我的绝对诚信、节约以及严格的经营习惯在这里又一次发挥了作用。我发现我的生意做得红红火火，我很快就成了“交易所”里万众瞩目的人物。事实上，我从不涉足华而不实的业务，而是依照一直以来严格的行业惯例，按部就班地逐步发展——要不是在经营该行业的一宗日常业务时发生了一点小小的意外，今天我应该还在从事这个行业。每当一个有钱又年老的吝啬鬼，或一个奢侈浪费的富家子，或一家濒临倒闭的公司动起了建造一座大楼的念头，那么世界上就没有什么东西能够打消他们的主意，每个聪明人都知道这个事情。这个事实正是“眼中钉”行业得以存在的基础。因此，当某一伙人刚刚开始酝酿建楼计划时，我们“眼中钉”这行的人就会在拟议的地皮上稳稳地占住一个适宜的角落，或者在其相邻或对面处占据一个最好的位置。这之后我们就开始等待，等到大楼建到一半，我们便雇一位颇具品位的建筑师在紧挨着大楼的地方为我们匆匆搭起一座虚有其表的简陋小土房；它可以是新英格兰或荷兰式的塔式建筑，或是一个猪圈，或是一间精巧、花哨的小屋，不管它是爱斯基摩式的，基卡普式的，还是霍屯督式的都可以。当然，在所得利润为购买地皮和灰泥所用成本的百分之五百的情况下，我们无论如何也不能够拆除那些建筑。我们能吗？我问了这样一个问题。我请教一些生意人。如果谁认为我们能够这样做，那一定是丧失理智了。可就有一家卑鄙的公司请求我做这样的交易——这样的交易啊！我当然没有接受他们荒唐的提议；但我认为自己有义务在当天晚上用烟灰涂黑他们的整座大楼。为了这件事，那群不讲道理的恶棍把我送进了监狱；当我出来时，“眼中钉”行业的绅士们不可避免地与我断绝了业务往来。","My strict integrity, economy, and rigorous business habits, here again came into play.I found myself driving a flourishing trade, and soon became a marked man upon “Change.”The truth is, I never dabbled in flashy matters, but jogged on in the good old sober routine of the calling—a calling in which I should, no doubt, have remained to the present hour, but for a little accident which happened to me in the prosecution of one of the usual business operations of the profession.Whenever a rich old hunks or prodigal heir or bankrupt corporation gets into the notion of putting up a palace, there is no such thing in the world as stopping either of them, and this every intelligent person knows.The fact in question is indeed the basis of the Eye-Sore trade.As soon, therefore, as a building-project is fairly afoot by one of these parties, we merchants secure a nice corner of the lot in contemplation, or a prime little situation just adjoining, or tight in front.This done, we wait until the palace is half-way up, and then we pay some tasty architect to run us up an ornamental mud hovel, right against it; or a Down-East or Dutch Pagoda, or a pig-sty, or an ingenious little bit of fancy work, either Esquimau, Kickapoo, or Hottentot.Of course we can’t afford to take these structures down under a bonus of five hundred per cent upon the prime cost of our lot and plaster.Can we?I ask the question.I ask it of business men.It would be irrational to suppose that we can.And yet there was a rascally corporation which asked me to do this very thing—this very thing!I did not reply to their absurd proposition, of course; but I felt it a duty to go that same night, and lamp-black the whole of their palace.For this the unreasonable villains clapped me into jail; and the gentlemen of the Eye-Sore trade could not well avoid cutting my connection when I came out."
"这时我为了生计，被迫冒着风险去做“苦肉计”的生意，这使我羸弱的体格感到有点不适应；但我还是怀着一颗善良的心开始了这项工作，而且发现同原来一样，那个讨人喜欢的老保姆给予我的有条不紊、一丝不苟的习惯让我获益匪浅——我要是在遗嘱里将她遗漏，那我就是最卑鄙的人。如我所言，凭着做每笔买卖都严格遵守规矩章法，凭着把每笔帐都记得条理分明，我使得自己能够克服许多难题，最后非常体面地在这个行业站稳了脚跟。事实上，在任何行业里都很少有人能像我这样将小生意做得如此利索。我只要从我的日记账里抄下一两页，就不必在这里自我吹嘘了——这是一种品格高尚的人应该避免的恶习。而日记帐是不会说谎的。","The Assault-and-Battery business, into which I was now forced to adventure for a livelihood, was somewhat ill-adapted to the delicate nature of my constitution; but I went to work in it with a good heart, and found my account here, as heretofore, in those stern habits of methodical accuracy which had been thumped into me by that delightful old nurse—I would indeed be the basest of men not to remember her well in my will.By observing, as I say, the strictest system in all my dealings, and keeping a well-regulated set of books, I was enabled to get over many serious difficulties, and, in the end, to establish myself very decently in the profession.The truth is, that few individuals, in any line, did a snugger little business than I.I will just copy a page or so out of my Day-Book; and this will save me the necessity of blowing my own trumpet—a contemptible practice of which no high-minded man will be guilty.Now, the Day-Book is a thing that don’t lie."
"“1月1日——元旦。街头偶遇“拳头硬”，他脚步踉跄。备忘——潜在顾客。稍后又遇“脾气暴”，他喝得烂醉如泥。备忘——也是潜在顾客。二位绅士均记入分类账，并各自开立流水账户。","“Jan. 1.—New Year’s Day.Met Snap in the street, groggy.Mem—he’ll do.Met Gruff shortly afterward, blind drunk.Mem—he’ll answer, too.Entered both gentlemen in my Ledger, and opened a running account with each."
"“１月２日——在交易所看见了“拳头硬”，走上前去猛踩其脚趾。他握紧拳头，把我打倒。好样的！——我又爬了起来。与代理人“肿眼泡”有细小的分歧。我想索要伤害赔偿金一千元，但他说那样被人打倒至多只能索赔五百元。备忘——务必辞退“肿眼泡”——毫无章法。","“Jan. 2.—Saw Snap at the Exchange, and went up and trod on his toe.Doubled his fist and knocked me down.Good!—got up again.Some trifling difficulty with Bag, my attorney.I want the damages at a thousand, but he says that for so simple a knock down we can’t lay them at more than five hundred.Mem—must get rid of Bag—no system at all."
"“1月3日——到剧院寻找“脾气暴”。见他就座于第二排的侧面包厢，在一胖一瘦两位女士中间。用观剧镜观察他们三个人，直到看见那位胖女士脸红了，对“脾气暴”窃窃私语。之后我走过去进了包厢，将鼻子凑到他伸手可及的地方。他没揪鼻子——初试未果。擤鼻再试——还是不行。我于是坐下，朝那位瘦女士眨眼睛，就在此刻发现他抓住我的后颈将我提起，把我抛向了正厅后方，我感到心满意足。颈关节错位，右腿恰到好处撕裂了。欢天喜地地回到家，喝了瓶香槟，记下这位年轻人欠账5000元。“肿眼泡”说索价合理。","“Jan. 3—Went to the theatre, to look for Gruff.Saw him sitting in a side box, in the second tier, between a fat lady and a lean one.Quizzed the whole party through an opera-glass, till I saw the fat lady blush and whisper to G.Went round, then, into the box, and put my nose within reach of his hand.Wouldn’t pull it—no go.Blew it, and tried again—no go.Sat down then, and winked at the lean lady, when I had the high satisfaction of finding him lift me up by the nape of the neck, and fling me over into the pit.Neck dislocated, and right leg capitally splintered.Went home in high glee, drank a bottle of champagne, and booked the young man for five thousand.Bag says it’ll do."
"“2月15日——“拳头硬”先生一案和解。入日记账金额——50美分——请见账目。","“Feb. 15—Compromised the case of Mr. Snap.Amount entered in Journal—fifty cents—which see."
"“2月16日——“脾气暴”一案败诉，那个恶棍给了我五美元。诉讼费用四元二角五分。净利润——请见日记账——75美分。","“Feb. 16.—Cast by that ruffian, Gruff, who made me a present of five dollars.Costs of suit, four dollars and twenty-five cents.Nett profit,—see Journal,—seventy-five cents.”"
"于是，在一段很短的时间内我就有了一笔至少1美元25美分的净收入——这还仅仅是“拳头硬”和“脾气暴”两个案例；而且我郑重地向读者保证，以上摘录是从我的日记账里随意节选的。","Now, here is a clear gain, in a very brief period, of no less than one dollar and twenty-five cents—this is in the mere cases of Snap and Gruff; and I solemnly assure the reader that these extracts are taken at random from my Day-Book."
"不过，家财万贯不如身体健康，这是个古老而千真万确的谚语。我觉得这个行业的要求对我羸弱的身体来说太过苛刻，后来我发现自己完全被揍得脱了形，搞得我都不知道该怎样处理这件事情，朋友们在街上碰见我根本认不出我就是彼得·普罗菲特，于是我想，权宜之计就是换个行业。因此，我把注意力转向“溅泥浆”行业，并且一干就是好几年。","It’s an old saying, and a true one, however, that money is nothing in comparison with health.I found the exactions of the profession somewhat too much for my delicate state of body; and, discovering, at last, that I was knocked all out of shape, so that I didn’t know very well what to make of the matter, and so that my friends, when they met me in the street, couldn’t tell that I was Peter Proffit at all, it occurred to me that the best expedient I could adopt was to alter my line of business.I turned my attention, therefore, to Mud-Dabbling, and continued it for some years."
"这一行业最不好的一点就是许多人都对其偏爱有加，因此竞争异常激烈。每一个发现自己没有足够的头脑在活动广告界、“眼中钉”或“苦肉计”行业中取得成功的笨蛋都会想当然地认为他会成为“溅泥浆”业的一把好手。可要是认为“溅泥浆”无需动脑子，那就犯了天大的错误了。特别是，在这一行里如果不讲条理将一无所成。我所做的只是小买卖，但我讲究条理的老习惯让我经营得非常顺利。首先，我非常审慎地选定了一个十字路口，除了这个十字路口，我从不把扫帚伸到城里的任何地方。我还小心翼翼地在我旁边弄出了一个漂亮的小泥坑，以便随时利用。凭借这些方法，我成为了众所周知的值得信任的人；我告诉你们，这使我的生意成功了一半。每个人都抛给我一枚铜币，然后穿着干净的裤子通过我的街口。我在这方面的经营习惯得到了人们的充分理解，因此我从未强加于人。我绝不会允许强加于人的事情。我从未强迫任何人，因此也没有人强迫我。当然，我无法阻止银行的欺诈行为。它们暂停营业给我带来了灾难性的不便。然而银行不是个人，而是企业；众所周知，企业既没有可让人踢踹的身体，也没有可供诅咒的灵魂。","The worst of this occupation is, that too many people take a fancy to it, and the competition is in consequence excessive.Every ignoramus of a fellow who finds that he hasn’t brains in sufficient quantity to make his way as a walking advertiser, or an eye-sore prig, or a salt-and-batter man, thinks, of course, that he’ll answer very well as a dabbler of mud.But there never was entertained a more erroneous idea than that it requires no brains to mud-dabble.Especially, there is nothing to be made in this way without method.I did only a retail business myself, but my old habits of system carried me swimmingly along.I selected my street-crossing, in the first place, with great deliberation, and I never put down a broom in any part of the town but that.I took care, too, to have a nice little puddle at hand, which I could get at in a minute.By these means I got to be well known as a man to be trusted; and this is one-half the battle, let me tell you, in trade.Nobody ever failed to pitch me a copper, and got over my crossing with a clean pair of pantaloons.And, as my business habits, in this respect, were sufficiently understood, I never met with any attempt at imposition.I wouldn’t have put up with it, if I had.Never imposing upon any one myself, I suffered no one to play the possum with me.The frauds of the banks of course I couldn’t help.Their suspension put me to ruinous inconvenience.These, however, are not individuals, but corporations; and corporations, it is very well known, have neither bodies to be kicked nor souls to be damned."
"正当我财源滚滚之时，我不幸受到诱惑将生意合并到了“狗溅泥”行业——这一行与“溅泥浆”有几分相似，但绝不是一个体面的职业。我选择的位置确实非常理想，位于市中心，而且我的鞋油和鞋刷都是一流的。我的小狗也长得胖胖的，嗅觉十分灵敏。可以说，他从事这一行已有很长时间，简直就是轻车熟路。我们通常的程序是：——小狗庞培先往自己身上滚一身泥浆，然后蹲坐在商店门口，直到看见一个穿着锃亮皮靴的花花公子朝它走近。之后它迎着那个人走过去，用它的毛在那双惠灵顿皮靴上蹭个一两下。于是那位花花公子破口大骂，环顾四周想找个擦鞋匠。而我就在那儿，在他的视线范围内，身边有鞋油和鞋刷。只要一分钟就能干完，之后六美分就到手了。这生意我们顺顺利利地做了一段时间；——实际上，我并非贪婪之人，可我的狗却贪得无厌。我答应给它三分之一的利润，但他坚持要对半分。这我不能接受——因此我俩吵了一架，之后就分道扬镳了。","I was making money at this business when, in an evil moment, I was induced to merge it in the Cur-Spattering—a somewhat analogous, but, by no means, so respectable a profession.My location, to be sure, was an excellent one, being central, and I had capital blacking and brushes.My little dog, too, was quite fat and up to all varieties of snuff.He had been in the trade a long time, and, I may say, understood it.Our general routine was this:—Pompey, having rolled himself well in the mud, sat upon end at the shop door, until he observed a dandy approaching in bright boots.He then proceeded to meet him, and gave the Wellingtons a rub or two with his wool.Then the dandy swore very much, and looked about for a boot-black.There I was, full in his view, with blacking and brushes.It was only a minute’s work, and then came a sixpence.This did moderately well for a time;—in fact, I was not avaricious, but my dog was.I allowed him a third of the profit, but he was advised to insist upon half.This I couldn’t stand—so we quarrelled and parted."
"接下来我又干了一阵“摇风琴”的生意，可以说我做得相当不错。这门生意简单易懂，不需要任何特殊的技艺。你可以使乐器只奏出一首曲子，而要做到这一点，你只需把这东西拆开，用一把锤子使劲敲三四下。这样一来，乐器的音质对做生意更加有益，其效果会远远超出你的想象。然后你就只需背着风琴闲荡，直到你看见一个路面上铺着鞣料树皮、门环上包着鹿皮的地方。这时你就停住脚步，摇响你的风琴，看上去好像你要算停下来，一直摇下去。不久就会有一扇窗户打开，有人抛给你六美分，并附上一句“别再出声了，赶紧滚开”之类的话。我知道一些摇风琴的人真的是拿到那笔钱就乖乖地“滚开”了；然而对于我来说，我觉得必要的花销实在太高，不允许我在少于12美分的情况下“滚开”。","I next tried my hand at the Organ-Grinding for a while, and may say that I made out pretty well.It is a plain, straightforward business, and requires no particular abilities.You can get a music-mill for a mere song, and to put it in order, you have but to open the works, and give them three or four smart raps with a hammer.It improves the tone of the thing, for business purposes, more than you can imagine.This done, you have only to stroll along, with the mill on your back, until you see tanbark in the street, and a knocker wrapped up in buckskin.Then you stop and grind; looking as if you meant to stop and grind till doomsday.Presently a window opens, and somebody pitches you a sixpence, with a request to “Hush up and go on,” etc.I am aware that some grinders have actually afforded to “go on” for this sum; but for my part, I found the necessary outlay of capital too great to permit of my “going on” under a shilling."
"干这一行，我做成过不少买卖；可我还是觉得不太满意，所以最终放弃了这一行业。事实是，我在不利的情况下工作——没有猴子的帮助，而且美国的街道太泥泞，民主党的贱民太霸道，到处都是些爱搞恶作剧的小男孩。","At this occupation I did a good deal; but, somehow, I was not quite satisfied, and so finally abandoned it.The truth is, I labored under the disadvantage of having no monkey—and American streets are so muddy, and a Democratic rabble is so obstrusive, and so full of demnition mischievous little boys."
"我失业了几个月，但最后凭借极大的兴趣成功地在“假邮件”一行占有了一席之地。这一行的职责并不复杂，但并非完全无利可图。譬如：我一大清早就得杜撰一捆假信。在每封信里我都得潦草地写几行字，内容是关于我能想得到的足以感到令人不可思议的话题——然后把所有书信签上汤姆·多布森、博比·汤普金斯或任何类似的名字。把信一封封折好，封上，再盖上假邮戳——新奥尔良、孟加拉、植物学湾或任何一个非常遥远的地方——之后我就立即出发，踏上当天的送信线路，显得极其匆忙似的。我总是挑选大户人家投送信件，收取邮资。人们在支付邮资时从不会迟疑不决——尤其是付双倍邮资更不犹豫——人真是蠢——还没等他们来得及打开信，我早就轻而易举地转过了一个拐角。这个职业的缺点就是我得走很多路，还要走得飞快；而且得非常频繁地变换路线。此外，我感到良心十分不安。我不忍心听见无辜的人遭到辱骂——全城人对汤姆·多布森和博比·汤普金斯的那种咒骂听起来真是可怕。我心怀憎恶洗手不干，不再做这门生意了。","I was now out of employment for some months, but at length succeeded, by dint of great interest, in procuring a situation in the Sham-Post.The duties, here, are simple, and not altogether unprofitable.For example:—very early in the morning I had to make up my packet of sham letters.Upon the inside of each of these I had to scrawl a few lines on any subject which occurred to me as sufficiently mysterious—signing all the epistles Tom Dobson, or Bobby Tompkins, or anything in that way.Having folded and sealed all, and stamped them with sham postmarks—New Orleans, Bengal, Botany Bay, or any other place a great way off—I set out, forthwith, upon my daily route, as if in a very great hurry.I always called at the big houses to deliver the letters, and receive the postage.Nobody hesitates at paying for a letter—especially for a double one—people are such fools—and it was no trouble to get round a corner before there was time to open the epistles.The worst of this profession was, that I had to walk so much and so fast; and so frequently to vary my route.Besides, I had serious scruples of conscience.I can’t bear to hear innocent individuals abused—and the way the whole town took to cursing Tom Dobson and Bobby Tompkins was really awful to hear.I washed my hands of the matter in disgust."
"我的第八个也是最后一个投机买卖就是“养猫”。我发现这是一门令人非常惬意又利润丰厚的生意，而且真的一点都不麻烦。众所周知，这个国家已经猫害成灾——以致于近来有一份由众人郑重签名的除猫请愿书被递交到州议会，而此时恰逢最近一轮令人难忘的会议。在这个时期，下院的信息异常灵通，在通过了许多明智又有益的法案后，《禁猫法》的通过更是锦上添花。在起初的《禁猫法》里，规定对提供猫头者给予奖金（每个四美分），但上议院成功地修正了该法案的主要条款，用“猫尾”字样代替了“猫头”。显而易见，这一修正非常恰当，获得众议员一致同意。","My eighth and last speculation has been in the Cat-Growing way.I have found that a most pleasant and lucrative business, and, really, no trouble at all.The country, it is well known, has become infested with cats—so much so of late, that a petition for relief, most numerously and respectably signed, was brought before the Legislature at its late memorable session.The Assembly, at this epoch, was unusually well-informed, and, having passed many other wise and wholesome enactments, it crowned all with the Cat-Act.In its original form, this law offered a premium for cat-heads (fourpence a-piece), but the Senate succeeded in amending the main clause, so as to substitute the word “tails” for “heads.”This amendment was so obviously proper, that the House concurred in it nem. con."
"州长刚一签署那项法案，我就投入所有资产购进雄猫和雌猫。一开始，我只能喂它们老鼠（价钱便宜），可人们执行起那项圣经般的禁令来，真是速度惊人。这让我终于认识到慷慨才是上策,于是我就让那些猫纵情享受牡蛎和乌龟。按照法定价格，如今它们的尾巴为我带来丰厚的收入；因为我发现借助望加锡头油，我一年能够收割三次。我还十分高兴地发现那些猫很快就习惯了这件事，它们宁愿是自己的尾巴被割掉，而不是其他部位。因此我认为自己是个成功的人，我正讨价还价，想要在哈得孙河畔购买一幢别墅。","As soon as the governor had signed the bill, I invested my whole estate in the purchase of Toms and Tabbies.At first I could only afford to feed them upon mice (which are cheap), but they fulfilled the scriptural injunction at so marvellous a rate, that I at length considered it my best policy to be liberal, and so indulged them in oysters and turtle.Their tails, at a legislative price, now bring me in a good income; for I have discovered a way, in which, by means of Macassar oil, I can force three crops in a year.It delights me to find, too, that the animals soon get accustomed to the thing, and would rather have the appendages cut off than otherwise.I consider myself, therefore, a made man, and am bargaining for a country seat on the Hudson."
