"作者：杰克·伦敦","by Jack London"
"彼得·温闭着眼睛舒服地仰靠在书房里的椅子上，脑子里沉思着一个不久将要进行的活动计划，他想要借此活动引起一帮有敌意的金融家的关注。前一天晚上他就想出了计划的核心思想，这会儿他正沉醉于设计其中的细枝末节。通过掌控一家内陆银行、两间百货商店和几个伐木场，他能够进而控制某一小段目前连名字都没有的偏僻铁路支线，但在他手里，这段支线将成为左右更大范围内局势的关键，涉及的主干线英里数几乎比前面提到的小段支线上的道钉还要多。这个主意太简单了，以至于他想到时几乎要笑出了声来。难怪他那群精明的宿敌们都忽视了这个想法。","Peter Winn lay back comfortably in a library chair, with closed eyes, deep in the cogitation of a scheme of campaign destined in the near future to make a certain coterie of hostile financiers sit up.The central idea had come to him the night before, and he was now reveling in the planning of the remoter, minor details.By obtaining control of a certain up-country bank, two general stores, and several logging camps, he could come into control of a certain dinky jerkwater line which shall here be nameless, but which, in his hands, would prove the key to a vastly larger situation involving more main-line mileage almost than there were spikes in the aforesaid dinky jerkwater.It was so simple that he had almost laughed aloud when it came to him.No wonder those astute and ancient enemies of his had passed it by."
"书房的门开了，一个瘦削的中年男人走了进来，他视力不好，戴着眼镜。在他手里有一个信封和一封打开了的信。作为彼得·温的秘书，他为老板筛选、分类和归纳信件是职责所在。","The library door opened, and a slender, middle-aged man, weak-eyed and eye glassed, entered.In his hands was an envelope and an open letter.As Peter Winn’s secretary it was his task to weed out, sort, and classify his employer’s mail."
"“这是早晨送来的信。”他抱歉地开口说道，脸上略带笑意，“当然并没有什么大事，但我想您可能会愿意看看这封信。”","“This came in the morning post,” he ventured apologetically and with the hint of a titter.“Of course it doesn’t amount to anything, but I thought you would like to see it.”"
"“念给我听。”彼得·温命令道，没有睁开眼睛。","“Read it,” Peter Winn commanded, without opening his eyes."
"秘书清了清嗓子。","The secretary cleared his throat."
"“这封信是7月17日发的，但没写地址，盖的是旧金山的邮戳。文字写得也很不通顺，拼写一塌糊涂。信是这样写的：","“It is dated July seventeenth, but is without address.Postmark San Francisco.It is also quite illiterate.The spelling is atrocious.Here it is:"
"彼得·温先生：我心怀敬意，通过快递寄给您了一只价值不菲的鸽子。它是只鹭鹭——”","Mr. Peter Winn, SIR: I send you respectfully by express a pigeon worth good money.She’s a loo-loo—”"
"“鹭鹭是什么？”彼得·温打断他问道。","“What is a loo-loo?” Peter Winn interrupted."
"秘书窃笑。","The secretary tittered."
"“我确定我也不知道，但我想它一定是一种顶级品种。信上继续写道：","“I’m sure I don’t know, except that it must be a superlative of some sort.The letter continues:"
"给鸽子身上绑上几张千元钞票，然后把它放飞。如果你照做的话，我就再也不会打扰你了。如果你不照办，你会后悔的。","Please freight it with a couple of thousand-dollar bills and let it go.If you do I wont never annoy you no more.If you dont you will be sorry."
"“信完了，没有署名。我觉得这信能让您高兴高兴。”","“That is all.It is unsigned.I thought it would amuse you.”"
"“鸽子送来了吗？”彼得·温问。","“Has the pigeon come?” Peter Winn demanded."
"“我确实从未想到过要询问这回事。”","“I’m sure I never thought to enquire.”"
"“那就赶紧去问。”","“Then do so.”"
"五分钟后秘书回来了。","In five minutes the secretary was back."
"“到了，先生。今天早晨到的。”","“Yes, sir.It came this morning.”"
"“那把鸽子带进来。”","“Then bring it in.”"
"秘书认为这件事是个恶作剧，但彼得·温在仔细检查过鸽子后却不这样认为。","The secretary was inclined to take the affair as a practical joke, but Peter Winn, after an examination of the pigeon, thought otherwise."
"“看看这鸽子，”他边说边抚弄着它，“看这修长的身体和细长的脖子，绝对适合运东西。我怀疑我应该不曾见过比这更完美的鸽子了。翅膀肌肉发达，十分有力。就像我们这位匿名的来信者讲的，这是只鹭鹭。真想自己养着它。”","“Look at it,” he said, stroking and handling it.“See the length of the body and that elongated neck.A proper carrier.I doubt if I’ve ever seen a finer specimen.Powerfully winged and muscled.As our unknown correspondent remarked, she is a loo-loo.It’s a temptation to keep her.”"
"秘书嗤嗤地笑了。","The secretary tittered."
"“为什么不呢？你肯定不会再让它飞回写信人那儿去了。”","“Why not?Surely you will not let it go back to the writer of that letter.”"
"彼得·温摇摇头。","Peter Winn shook his head."
"“我会回信的。没有人能威胁我，就算他们匿名来信或是做出一番蠢事来也不行。”","“I’ll answer.No man can threaten me, even anonymously or in foolery.”"
"他在一张纸片上言简意赅地写了“去死吧！”几个字，签上名，然后把纸片放进了鸽子腿上的传送筒里，这是它考虑周到的主人早就绑好了的。","On a slip of paper he wrote the succinct message, “Go to hell,” signed it, and placed it in the carrying apparatus with which the bird had been thoughtfully supplied."
"“现在让它飞走吧。我儿子在哪儿？我想让他看看这次飞行。”","“Now we’ll let her loose.Where’s my son?I’d like him to see the flight.”"
"“他在车间里。昨晚他就睡在那儿了，今天早晨他派人把早餐送了过去。”","“He’s down in the workshop.He slept there last night, and had his breakfast sent down this morning.”"
"“他迟早会拼掉性命的。”彼得·温边向阳台走去边说道，口气里半是严厉半是自豪。","“He’ll break his neck yet,” Peter Winn remarked, half-fiercely, half-proudly, as he led the way to the veranda."
"站在宽阔的台阶顶上，他将这只漂亮的鸽子向高空抛去。鸽子迅速扇动翅膀，迟疑地盘旋了片刻，然后飞上天空。","Standing at the head of the broad steps, he tossed the pretty creature outward and upward.She caught herself with a quick beat of wings, fluttered about undecidedly for a space, then rose in the air."
"然而在高空中，鸽子似乎还是有些迟疑，而后它显然找到了方向，于是向东飞去，飞过了那片散布在绿地上的橡树林，那片绿地宛若公园。","Again, high up, there seemed indecision; then, apparently getting her bearings, she headed east, over the oak-trees that dotted the park-like grounds."
"“很美，很美，”彼得·温小声说，“我都有点儿希望它能回到我身边了。”","“Beautiful, beautiful,” Peter Winn murmured.“I almost wish I had her back.”"
"可彼得·温很忙，脑子里要盘算那些大计划，手头上还掌管着许多事务，所以他很快便忘了这个插曲。三天后的晚上，他乡间别墅的左翼侧厅发生了爆炸。爆炸不是很严重，没人受伤，但侧厅被炸毁了。别墅里其他房间的窗户大都被震碎了，损失的范围很广。六个旧金山的警探搭乘早晨第一班渡船来到现场。几个小时后，秘书突然万分激动地出现在彼得·温面前。","But Peter Winn was a very busy man, with such large plans in his head and with so many reins in his hands that he quickly forgot the incident.Three nights later the left wing of his country house was blown up.It was not a heavy explosion, and nobody was hurt, though the wing itself was ruined.Most of the windows of the rest of the house were broken, and there was a deal of general damage.By the first ferry boat of the morning half a dozen San Francisco detectives arrived, and several hours later the secretary, in high excitement, erupted on Peter Winn."
"“它来了！”秘书气喘吁吁地说，他的额头上渗着汗珠，眼镜后的眼睛瞪得圆鼓鼓的。","“It’s come!” the secretary gasped, the sweat beading his forehead and his eyes bulging behind their glasses."
"“什么来了？”彼得问。“那——那只鹭鹭鸟。”","“What has come?” Peter demanded.“It—the—the loo-loo bird.”"
"这个金融家立刻就懂了。","Then the financier understood."
"“你有没有检查过是否有信件？”","“Have you gone over the mail yet?”"
"“我正准备查看呢，先生。”","“I was just going over it, sir.”"
"“那就继续吧，看你能不能找到我们这位爱鸽子的神秘朋友寄来的另一封信。”","“Then continue, and see if you can find another letter from our mysterious friend, the pigeon fancier.”"
"信找到了。上面写着：","The letter came to light.It read:"
"彼得·温先生，我尊敬的先生：别干傻事。要是你之前肯照办，你的小室也不会被炸了——我敬告你，同时送上同一只鸽子。照上次说的做，谢谢。把五张一千元的美钞绑在鸽子身上，然后放飞。别喂它，也别想跟着它。现在它可很会认路，飞得也很快。如果你不照办，那就要当心了。","Mr. Peter Winn, HONORABLE SIR: Now dont be a fool.If you’d came through, your shack would not have blew up—I beg to inform you respectfully, am sending same pigeon.Take good care of same, thank you.Put five one thousand dollar bills on her and let her go.Dont feed her.Dont try to follow bird.She is wise to the way now and makes better time.If you dont come through, watch out."
"彼得·温真地生气了。这次他没有再让鸽子帮他捎口信。相反，他召集了所有的警探，并在他们的建议下，往鸽子身上绑上了重重的弹丸。鸽子之前都是向东朝海湾飞去，一旦飞过水面上空，蒂伯龙最快的摩托艇就会受命追赶。","Peter Winn was genuinely angry.This time he indited no message for the pigeon to carry.Instead, he called in the detectives, and, under their advice, weighted the pigeon heavily with shot.Her previous flight having been eastward toward the bay, the fastest motor-boat in Tiburon was commissioned to take up the chase if it led out over the water."
"但鸽子身上负载的弹丸太沉了，还没飞到海岸，它就精疲力尽了。之后他们又犯了让鸽子负载太轻的错误，鸽子飞到高空中，找到方向后一直向东飞越了旧金山湾。它径直飞过了天使岛，而在这儿摩托艇因为得绕着岛走，所以把它跟丢了。","But too much shot had been put on the carrier, and she was exhausted before the shore was reached.Then the mistake was made of putting too little shot on her, and she rose high in the air, got her bearings and started eastward across San Francisco Bay.She flew straight over Angel Island, and here the motor-boat lost her, for it had to go around the island."
"那天晚上，武装警卫在这片区域巡逻。没有爆炸发生。但第二天一大早，彼得·温就从电话里得知，他姐姐在阿拉梅达的家被烧成了平地。","That night, armed guards patrolled the grounds.But there was no explosion.Yet, in the early morning Peter Winn learned by telephone that his sister’s home in Alameda had been burned to the ground."
"两天后鸽子又回来了，这次是被放在一个看似装满了土豆的桶里运回来的。同样，鸽子又带来了一封信：","Two days later the pigeon was back again, coming this time by freight in what had seemed a barrel of potatoes.Also came another letter:"
"彼得·温先生，我尊敬的先生：是我修整了下令姐的房子。你招惹了魔鬼，不是吗？这次你得给我一万块了。金额每次都会上升。别再往鸽子身上加些妨碍它飞行的重物了。你肯定追不上它的，而且这对动物很残忍。","Mr. Peter Winn, RESPECTABLE SIR: It was me that fixed yr sisters house.You have raised hell, aint you.Send ten thousand now.Going up all the time.Dont put any more handicap weights on that bird.You sure cant follow her, and its cruelty to animals."
"彼得·温就要承认自己被打败了。警探们都无能为力，彼得不知道这个人下次又会袭击哪里——可能会是那些他亲近和爱护的人的生命。他甚至打电话去旧金山那边，让人准备一万元的大额美钞。但彼得·温有个儿子，叫小彼得·温。和他父亲一样，他也有着坚实的下巴，目光里都透着一种复杂而深邃的坚定。他只有26岁，却已经是位堂堂男子汉了。这位金融家私底下对他是又爱又愁，时而为儿子超群的飞机技艺感到自豪，时而又怕他出事故，英年早逝，悲惨收场。","Peter Winn was ready to acknowledge himself beaten.The detectives were powerless, and Peter did not know where next the man would strike—perhaps at the lives of those near and dear to him.He even telephoned to San Francisco for ten thousand dollars in bills of large denomination.But Peter had a son, Peter Winn, Junior, with the same firm-set jaw as his fathers, and the same knitted, brooding determination in his eyes.He was only twenty-six, but he was all man, a secret terror and delight to the financier, who alternated between pride in his son’s aeroplane feats and fear for an untimely and terrible end."
"“等一下，爸爸，先别把钱送出去。”小彼得·温说道，“第八号飞机已经准备就绪，我终于知道怎样缩帆了。这会成功的，而且这会成为飞行史上的革命。速度——这就是我们所需要的，同样还有起飞和升高所需的大面积支撑表面。这两者我都已经具备。一旦飞上高空，我就缩帆，就这样。支撑表面面积越小，速度越快，这是兰勒发现的定律，而我把它应用在了实践中。无风或是狂风的情况下我都能够驾驶飞机上升，通过控制飞机的不同部位，我几乎可以实现任何想要的速度。特别是现在还有了新型桑斯特-恩多姆发动机。”","“Hold on, father, don’t send that money,” said Peter Winn, Junior.“Number Eight is ready, and I know I’ve at last got that reefing down fine.It will work, and it will revolutionize flying.Speed—that’s what’s needed, and so are the large sustaining surfaces for getting started and for altitude.I’ve got them both.Once I’m up I reef down.There it is.The smaller the sustaining surface, the higher the speed.That was the law discovered by Langley.And I’ve applied it.I can rise when the air is calm and full of holes, and I can rise when its boiling, and by my control of my plane areas I can come pretty close to making any speed I want.Especially with that new Sangster-Endholm engine.”"
"“你这些天真是接近拼命了。”父亲的话里满是鼓舞。","“You’ll come pretty close to breaking your neck one of these days,” was his father’s encouraging remark."
"“爸爸，我来告诉你我真正要接近的是什么——九十英里每小时——是的，甚至是一百英里每小时的速度。现在听我说！我本来打算明天进行一次试飞。但不需要两个小时，我今天就可以开始试飞。今天下午我会处理好的。把钱收好。把鸽子给我，我会跟住它找到它的鸽房，不管在哪儿。等一下，让我先跟技师谈谈。”","“Dad, I’ll tell you what I’ll come pretty close to—ninety miles an hour—Yes, and a hundred.Now listen!I was going to make a trial tomorrow.But it won’t take two hours to start today.I’ll tackle it this afternoon.Keep that money.Give me the pigeon and I’ll follow her to her loft where ever it is.Hold on, let me talk to the mechanics.”"
"他打电话到车间，言简意赅地传达了命令，这让他父亲很满意。真的，他这个儿子可是子肖其父，就像大木头上砍下来的小木片，而彼得·温对他自己这块大木头的内在价值可是毫不谦虚。","He called up the workshop, and in crisp, terse sentences gave his orders in a way that went to the older man’s heart.Truly, his one son was a chip off the old block, and Peter Winn had no meek notions concerning the intrinsic value of said old block."
"计时精确到了分钟，两小时后，年轻人已经准备好要起飞了。胯部挂着的枪套里有一把大口径自动手枪，以备不时之需，手枪竖放着，拉上了保险。他最后一次详细彻底地检查了一遍，然后坐上了飞机驾驶座。他发动了引擎，随着一阵气体爆炸的巨大隆隆声，这架漂亮的飞机猛地掠过跑道冲上了天空。飞机上升的同时向西飞去绕着圈，他来回盘旋并做了一些调整的飞行动作，为比赛的正式开始做准备。","Timed to the minute, the young man, two hours later, was ready for the start.In a holster at his hip, for instant use, cocked and with the safety on, was a large-caliber automatic pistol.With a final inspection and overhauling he took his seat in the aeroplane.He started the engine, and with a wild burr of gas explosions the beautiful fabric darted down the launching ways and lifted into the air.Circling, as he rose, to the west, he wheeled about and jockeyed and maneuvered for the real start of the race."
"比赛的开始取决于鸽子。彼得·温抱着它。这次它身上没有绑弹丸，而是在腿上紧紧地系了半码鲜艳的丝带——好让飞机更容易追踪它的飞行。彼得·温松开了手，尽管有丝带的轻微牵绊，鸽子还是轻松地飞上了天空。它的行动尽在掌握之中。这是它第三次特意往家飞了，它知道路线。","This start depended on the pigeon.Peter Winn held it.Nor was it weighted with shot this time.Instead, half a yard of bright ribbon was firmly attached to its leg—this the more easily to enable its flight being followed.Peter Winn released it, and it arose easily enough despite the slight drag of the ribbon.There was no uncertainty about its movements.This was the third time it had made particular homing passage, and it knew the course."
"飞到数百英尺的高空时，鸽子开始按既定路线径直向前飞去。飞机也从刚才的弧形线路转为了直线行驶，紧紧跟着鸽子。比赛开始了。彼得·温抬头看去，只见鸽子把飞机远远地抛在身后。然而他又看见了别的。飞机在一瞬间忽然变小了。它收起了帆。飞机设计中高速的特点显现出来了。起飞时飞机需要大面积地伸展表面，与那时不同，现在飞机变成了一种机身较细，像鹰一般的单翼飞机，靠两个极窄的长机翼保持平衡。","At an altitude of several hundred feet it straightened out and went due cast.The aeroplane swerved into a straight course from its last curve and followed.The race was on.Peter Winn, looking up, saw that the pigeon was outdistancing the machine.Then he saw something else.The aeroplane suddenly and instantly became smaller.It had reefed.Its high-speed plane-design was now revealed.Instead of the generous spread of surface with which it had taken the air, it was now a lean and hawklike monoplane balanced on long and exceedingly narrow wings."
"当小温忽然收帆时，他也不禁一惊。这是他新装备的处女秀，虽然早就料到速度会有提升，但他没想到提升的幅度竟如此惊人。这比他想象的还要好，在自己意识到之前，他已经紧紧地跟在鸽子身后了。那小家伙吓坏了，它从未见过如此可怕的鹰，于是立刻向上猛冲，就像别的鸽子遇见鹰时的反应一样，总想奋力飞到鹰的上面。","When young Winn reefed down so suddenly, he received a surprise.It was his first trial of the new device, and while he was prepared for increased speed he was not prepared for such an astonishing increase.It was better than he dreamed, and, before he knew it, he was hard upon the pigeon.That little creature, frightened by this, the most monstrous hawk it had ever seen, immediately darted upward, after the manner of pigeons that strive always to rise above a hawk."
"飞机拐了几个大弯跟了上去，越飞越高，直冲云霄。要从下面仰视鸽子并不是件容易的事，而小温一刻也不敢让鸽子逃离自己的视线。他甚至把帆张开，好更快地上升。他们一直，一直向上飞，直到鸽子出于本能下降时撞到了追赶它的敌人的背部。一下就够了，因为它显然发现这机器平滑的布面没有生命可言，于是它不再高飞，转而径直向东飞去。","In great curves the monoplane followed upward, higher and higher into the blue.It was difficult, from underneath to see the pigeon. and young Winn dared not lose it from his sight.He even shook out his reefs in order to rise more quickly.Up, up they went, until the pigeon, true to its instinct, dropped and struck at what it to be the back of its pursuing enemy.Once was enough, for, evidently finding no life in the smooth cloth surface of the machine, it ceased soaring and straightened out on its eastward course."
"信鸽在飞翔过程中可以达到非常高的速度，所以温再次收帆。令他满意的是，他发现自己又一次追上了鸽子。但这次他迅速抖开了一部分已经收起来的帆，并及时减速。从那时起他就知道，这个目标已经被他牢牢盯住；也是从那时起，他开始无意识地哼起歌来，并在接下来的飞行中时不时下地唱着。歌是这样唱的：“大获成功呀大获成功，我是怎么说的——大获成功。”","A carrier pigeon on a passage can achieve a high rate of speed, and Winn reefed again.And again, to his satisfaction, be found that he was beating the pigeon.But this time he quickly shook out a portion of his reefed sustaining surface and slowed down in time.From then on he knew he had the chase safely in hand, and from then on a chant rose to his lips which he continued to sing at intervals, and unconsciously, for the rest of the passage.It was: “Going some; going some; what did I tell you—going some.”"
"即便是这样，飞行也不是一帆风顺的。空气充其量只是种不稳定的介质。转过一个锐角，他冲进了一股气流中，一切来得毫无征兆，而他判断出这是从金门海峡风口涌过来的海湾气流。他的右机翼最先感觉到气流——一阵急促猛烈的风吹得单翼机上升并倾斜，眼看就要让它倾覆。但他小心翼翼地驾驶着飞机，迅速但又不会过快地调整了翼尖的角度，放下前方的水平方向舵，转动了后方的垂直方向舵，以应付使机身斜倾的风力，这一切都做得游刃有余。飞机恢复平稳之后，他知道此刻自己已经完全处于无形的气流之中了，于是他再次调整翼尖，在他困窘的片刻间飞机已迅速驶出险境。","Even so, it was not all plain sailing.The air is an unstable medium at best, and quite without warning, at an acute angle, he entered an aerial tide which he recognized as the gulf stream of wind that poured through the drafty-mouthed Golden Gate.His right wing caught it first—a sudden, sharp puff that lifted and tilted the monoplane and threatened to capsize it.But he rode with a sensitive “loose curb,” and quickly, but not too quickly, he shifted the angles of his wing-tips, depressed the front horizontal rudder, and swung over the rear vertical rudder to meet the tilting thrust of the wind.As the machine came back to an even keel, and he knew that he was now wholly in the invisible stream, he readjusted the wing-tips, rapidly away from him during the several moments of his discomfiture."
"鸽子径直向阿拉梅达郡的海岸飞去，就在这片海岸附近，温又遭遇了一次小事件。他跌进了风眼里。之前的飞行中他也曾掉进过风眼，但这次的风眼比他以往遇见的要大得多。他双眼紧盯着系在鸽子身上的丝带，通过那抹飘动的颜色他判断出飞机正在下落。随着下落，他的胸口又出现了那种熟悉的下坠感觉，那是他小时候第一次乘急速升降台的时候就知道的感觉。但在飞行的众多秘诀中，温还学到了，要向上飞有时候需要先下降。空气还是拒绝托住他。与其冒险在没有支撑的情况下做无用的挣扎，他选择随风而动。他头脑镇定，手稳稳地压低了前面的水平方向舵——尺度拿捏得刚刚好，不多分毫——单翼机先是向前俯冲下去，然后从上空急转直下。飞机下落时就像刀身锐利地划过，速度每分每秒都在急剧增加。这样，他积聚了自救所需的动量。突然把两个水平方向舵分别调整为向前和向后，他驾着收紧的飞机直冲向上，驶离了风眼，却只用了眨眼的功夫。","The pigeon drove straight on for the Alameda County shore, and it was near this shore that Winn had another experience.He fell into an air-hole.He had fallen into air-holes before, in previous flights, but this was a far larger one than he had ever encountered.With his eyes strained on the ribbon attached to the pigeon, by that fluttering bit of color he marked his fall.Down he went, at the pit of his stomach that old sink sensation which he had known as a boy he first negotiated quick-starting elevators.But Winn, among other secrets of aviation, had learned that to go up it was sometimes necessary first to go down.The air had refused to hold him.Instead of struggling futilely and perilously against this lack of sustentation, he yielded to it.With steady head and hand, he depressed the forward horizontal rudder—just recklessly enough and not a fraction more—and the monoplane dived head foremost and sharply down the void.It was falling with the keenness of a knife-blade. Every instant the speed accelerated frightfully.Thus he accumulated the momentum that would save him.But few instants were required, when, abruptly shifting the double horizontal rudders forward and astern, he shot upward on the tense and straining plane and out of the pit."
"在五百英尺高处，鸽子继续飞行，越过了伯克利镇，然后又向上飞了些，准备穿越康特拉科斯塔群山。在跟着鸽子上升的过程中，小温注意到了加利福尼亚大学的校园和建筑——那是他的母校。","At an altitude of five hundred feet, the pigeon drove on over the town of Berkeley and lifted its flight to the Contra Costa hills.Young Winn noted the campus and buildings of the University of California—his university—as he rose after the pigeon."
"刚飞进康特拉科斯塔群山上空，他就再次遇到意外。鸽子现在飞得很低，一旁的一片桉树林成为了坚固的挡风墙，而鸽子忽然被吹得向上扑腾了一百英尺。温知道这意味着什么。它遇上了气浪，气浪直冲上数百英尺的高空，凛冽的西风吹来，摧毁了耸立的桉树墙。他急忙将帆收至最小，同时压低飞行角度以应对上升的气流。然而，在完全摆脱危险之前，飞机还是被气流震荡着飞了整整三百英尺。","Once more, on these Contra Costa hills, he early came to grief.The pigeon was now flying low, and where a grove of eucalyptus presented a solid front to the wind, the bird was suddenly sent fluttering wildly upward for a distance of a hundred feet.Winn knew what it meant.It had been caught in an air-surf that beat upward hundreds of feet where the fresh west wind smote the upstanding wall of the grove.He reefed hastily to the uttermost, and at the same time depressed the angle of his flight to meet that upward surge.Nevertheless, the monoplane was tossed fully three hundred feet before the danger was left astern."
"鸽子又飞过了几条山脉，然后温看见它落在了一个楼梯平台上，那里有个小屋矗立在山腰的空地上。他很庆幸这有块空地。这儿不仅适合降落，而且由于山坡陡峭，也十分适于再次起飞。","Two or more ranges of hills the pigeon crossed, and then Winn saw it dropping down to a landing where a small cabin stood in a hillside clearing.He blessed that clearing.Not only was it good for alighting, but, on account of the steepness of the slope, it was just the thing for rising again into the air."
"一个正在看报的男人一看见鸽子飞了回来就猛地站起身来，就在这时，他听见温的飞机引擎的轰隆声响，接着看见了这架巨大的单翼机，完全伸展开地直向他冲降过来。温通过移动水平方向舵当即打开了气垫，飞机突然落在气垫上，滑行了数码远，碰到了地面，最后停在了离他不到二十英尺的地方。然而，当他看见一个年轻人镇静地坐在飞机里用手枪瞄准他时，他转身就跑。还没有跑到小屋的拐角处，一颗子弹就射穿了他的腿部，他一下趴倒在地上。","A man, reading a newspaper, had just started up at the sight of the returning pigeon, when he heard the burr of Winn’s engine and saw the huge monoplane, with all surfaces set, drop down upon him, stop suddenly on an air-cushion manufactured on the spur of the moment by a shift of the horizontal rudders, glide a few yards, strike ground, and come to rest not a score of feet away from him.But when he saw a young man, calmly sitting in the machine and leveling a pistol at him, the man turned to run.Before he could make the corner of the cabin, a bullet through the leg brought him down in a sprawling fall."
"“你想怎么样！”看着自己上方站着的那个人，他愠怒地问道。","“What do you want!” he demanded sullenly, as the other stood over him."
"“我想带你乘坐我的新飞机。”温回答道，“相信我，它是只鹭鹭。”","“I want to take you for a ride in my new machine,” Winn answered.“Believe me, she is a loo-loo.”"
"男人并没有争论多久，因为这个陌生来客有最有说服力的方法让他乖乖听话。一直被人拿枪指着，他在温的指示下临时扯了一根止血带，缠在了受伤的腿上。温帮他坐到了飞机的座位上，然后去鸽房里拿上那只腿上还紧紧系着丝带的鸽子。","The man did not argue long, for this strange visitor had most convincing ways.Under Winn’s instructions, covered all the time by the pistol, the man improvised a tourniquet and applied it to his wounded leg.Winn helped him to a seat in the machine, then went to the pigeon-loft and took possession of the bird with the ribbon still fast to its leg."
"事实证明，这人是个非常听话的囚犯。一飞上天，他就老老实实地坐着，心里恐惧极了。虽然他深谙如何让勒索信长上翅膀飞，却没本事给自己也安对翅膀。当他低头凝视在他之下很远处那飞掠而过的田地和水域时，他都没想过要去攻击这个抓他的人，尽管此刻这个人双手都忙着操控飞机，毫无防备。","A very tractable prisoner, the man proved.Once up in the air, he sat close, in an ecstasy of fear.An adept at winged blackmail, he had no aptitude for wings himself, and when he gazed down at the flying land and water far beneath him, he did not feel moved to attack his captor, now defenseless, both hands occupied with flight."
"相反，这个人唯一想做的就是坐得更老实点儿。","Instead, the only way the man felt moved was to sit closer."
"老彼得·温用高倍望远镜扫视着天空，看见单翼机跃进了视野，在天使岛崎岖的主山脉上空越变越大。几分钟后，他大叫着告诉等待的侦探们，飞机上还坐着另一个乘客。飞机迅速降落，忽然弹出一个不断膨胀的气垫来，单翼机着陆了。","Peter Winn, Senior, scanning the heavens with powerful glasses, saw the monoplane leap into view and grow large over the rugged backbone of Angel Island.Several minutes later he cried out to the waiting detectives that the machine carried a passenger.Dropping swiftly and piling up an abrupt air-cushion, the monoplane landed."
"“收帆飞机成功了！”小温爬出飞机时大喊道，“起飞的时候你看见我了吗？我几乎超过了鸽子。大获成功呀，爸爸！大获成功！我是怎么跟你说的？大获成功！”","“That reefing device is a winner!” young Winn cried, as he climbed out.“Did you see me at the start?I almost ran over the pigeon.Going some, dad!Going some!What did I tell you?Going some!”"
"“可跟你一起回来的是谁啊？”他父亲问道。","“But who is that with you?” his father demanded."
"年轻人向后看看，这才想起他的囚犯。","The young man looked back at his prisoner and remembered."
