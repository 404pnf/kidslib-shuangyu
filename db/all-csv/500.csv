"The Master Cat; or, Puss in Boots","穿靴子的猫咪"
"by Andrew Lang","作者：安德鲁·朗格"
"There was a miller who left no more estate to the three sons he had than his mill, his ass, and his cat.","从前有一个磨坊主，他只给他的三个儿子留下了一个磨坊、一头驴子和一只猫这三样遗产。"
"The partition was soon made.","遗产很快就被分光。"
"Neither scrivener nor attorney was sent for.","既没有请公证人也没有请律师。"
"They would soon have eaten up all the poor patrimony.","因为他们一来肯定就会马上私吞掉这笔少得可怜的遗产。"
"The eldest had the mill, the second the ass, and the youngest nothing but the cat.","大儿子得到了磨坊，二儿子得到了驴子，小儿子只得到了猫。"
"The poor young fellow was quite comfortless at having so poor a lot.","只分到了这么点儿，这个可怜的年轻人感到十分难过。"
"“My brothers,” said he, “may get their living handsomely enough by joining their stocks together; but for my part, when I have eaten up my cat, and made me a muff of his skin, I must die of hunger.”","“我的哥哥们只要用他们分到的遗产合伙就可以生活得很好，”他说，“而我呢，当我吃掉这条猫，再用它的皮毛做成一副手套后还是会饿死。”"
"The Cat, who heard all this, but made as if he did not, said to him with a grave and serious air:","这些话猫咪全听到了，但它装作没听到一样，用一种庄重而严肃的语气对他说："
"“Do not thus afflict yourself, my good master.","“不要折磨自己了，我的主人。"
"You have nothing else to do but to give me a bag and get a pair of boots made for me that I may scamper through the dirt and the brambles, and you shall see that you have not so bad a portion in me as you imagine.”","您现在只需要给我一个口袋，再给我做一双靴子，让我能在泥污和荆棘中奔走，然后您会发现，我这份遗产并不像您想的那么糟糕。”"
"The Cat’s master did not build very much upon what he said.","猫咪的主人并未对它的话有多大指望。"
"He had often seen him play a great many cunning tricks to catch rats and mice, as when he used to hang by the heels, or hide himself in the meal, and make as if he were dead; so that he did not altogether despair of his affording him some help in his miserable condition.","他经常看到它耍一些狡猾的小把戏来捉各种老鼠，比如倒着悬挂起来或者藏在面粉里装死，所以他还是抱了一丝希望，觉得猫咪会给他悲惨的处境带来一点儿帮助。"
"When the Cat had what he asked for he booted himself very gallantly, and putting his bag about his neck, he held the strings of it in his two forepaws and went into a warren where was great abundance of rabbits.","猫咪得到了它要求的东西之后，马上就雄赳赳地穿上了靴子，并把口袋挂在了脖子上，用两只前爪握住绳子，然后走进了一个住了很多兔子的兔子窝。"
"He put bran and sow-thistle into his bag, and stretching out at length, as if he had been dead, he waited for some young rabbits, not yet acquainted with the deceits of the world, to come and rummage his bag for what he had put into it.","它放了些糠和苣苦菜在口袋里，然后四肢大开地躺下来，看上去像是死了一样，等那些不谙世事的小兔子上钩，过来翻找它口袋里的东西。"
"Scarce was he lain down but he had what he wanted.","它刚一躺下便如愿以偿了。"
"A rash and foolish young rabbit jumped into his bag, and Monsieur Puss, immediately drawing close the strings, took and killed him without pity.","一只鲁莽愚笨的小兔子跳进它的口袋，猫咪绅士立刻收紧绳子，抓住了兔子并毫不留情地杀死了它。"
"Proud of his prey, he went with it to the palace and asked to speak with his majesty.","猫咪得意洋洋地带着自己的猎物来到了王宫，并求见国王。"
"He was shown upstairs into the King’s apartment, and, making a low reverence, said to him:","它被带到楼上国王的房间，行了一个深深的礼后，它对国王说："
"“I have brought you, sir, a rabbit of the warren, which my noble lord the Marquis of Carabas” (for that was the title which puss was pleased to give his master) “has commanded me to present to your majesty from him.”","“陛下，这只兔子是卡拉巴斯侯爵大人（猫咪自作主张给主人起的名字）命我献给陛下您的。”"
"“Tell thy master,” said the king, “that I thank him and that he does me a great deal of pleasure.”","“告诉你的主人，”国王说，“我很感谢他，我很高兴。”"
"Another time he went and hid himself among some standing corn, holding still his bag open, and when a brace of partridges ran into it he drew the strings and so caught them both.","还有一次，它藏身在一片麦田里，一动不动地张着口袋，当一对山鹑钻了进去时，它拉紧绳子，把两只都捉到了。"
"He went and made a present of these to the king, as he had done before of the rabbit which he took in the warren.","它又去将这些进献给了国王，和之前兔子的那次一样。"
"The king, in like manner, received the partridges with great pleasure, and ordered him some money for drink.","国王同样十分欣喜地收下了山鹑，并赏给它一些钱喝酒。"
"The Cat continued for two or three months thus to carry his Majesty, from time to time, game of his master’s taking.","在接下来的两三个月里，猫咪一次又一次以它主人的名义向国王献礼。"
"One day in particular, when he knew for certain that he was to take the air along the river-side, with his daughter, the most beautiful princess in the world, he said to his master:","有一天，它听到国王将要带着他的女儿——世界上最美丽的公主——去河边兜风，便对它的主人说："
"“If you will follow my advice your fortune is made.","“如果您照着我说的去做，您的好运就来了。"
"You have nothing else to do but go and wash yourself in the river, in that part I shall show you, and leave the rest to me.”","您只需要去河里，在我指定的地方洗澡，其他的交给我就行了。”"
"The Marquis of Carabas did what the Cat advised him to, without knowing why or wherefore.","虽然感到一头雾水，“卡拉巴斯侯爵”还是按照猫咪的话照做了。"
"While he was washing the King passed by, and the Cat began to cry out:","当他在洗澡时，国王从附近经过，猫咪呼叫起来："
"“Help! help!","“救命啊！救命啊！"
"My Lord Marquis of Carabas is going to be drowned.”","卡拉巴斯侯爵大人要快淹死啦！”"
"At this noise the King put his head out of the coach-window, and, finding it was the Cat who had so often brought him such good game, he commanded his guards to run immediately to the assistance of his Lordship the Marquis of Carabas.","听到声音后，国王把头探出马车窗，看到是经常给他献礼的猫咪在呼救，便立刻命令侍卫去帮忙救那位卡拉巴斯侯爵上来。"
"While they were drawing the poor Marquis out of the river, the Cat came up to the coach and told the King that, while his master was washing, there came by some rogues, who went off with his clothes, though he had cried out: “Thieves! thieves!” several times, as loud as he could.","他们将可怜的“侯爵”拉上岸，猫咪来到马车边，告诉国王，它的主人在洗澡的时候，几个恶徒经过，尽管它撕破喉咙地呼叫数声“抓贼啊！抓贼啊！”他们还是把他的衣服偷走了。"
"This cunning Cat had hidden them under a great stone.","其实是这只狡黠的猫把衣服藏在了一块大石头下面。"
"The King immediately commanded the officers of his wardrobe to run and fetch one of his best suits for the Lord Marquis of Carabas.","国王马上派他掌管衣橱的侍卫去拿一套他最好看的服装来，给“卡拉巴斯侯爵”穿。"
"The King caressed him after a very extraordinary manner, and as the fine clothes he had given him extremely set off his good mien (for he was well made and very handsome in his person), the King’s daughter took a secret inclination to him, and the Marquis of Carabas had no sooner cast two or three respectful and somewhat tender glances but she fell in love with him to distraction.","国王深深地爱抚了他，穿上了获赠的漂亮衣服的“侯爵”显得仪表不凡（因为他本身就长得很英俊），国王的女儿对他一见倾心，而“卡拉巴斯侯爵”紧接着带有尊敬且有几分温柔地看了她几眼，让公主已经无法自拔地爱上他了。"
"The King would needs have him come into the coach and take part of the airing.","国王邀请他上了马车并一起参与这次兜风。"
"The Cat, quite overjoyed to see his project begin to succeed, marched on before, and, meeting with some countrymen, who were mowing a meadow, he said to them:","猫咪看到计划快要成功，喜不自胜地向前跑去，它看到几个正在割草的农民，对他们说："
"“Good people, you who are mowing, if you do not tell the King that the meadow you mow belongs to my Lord Marquis of Carabas, you shall be chopped as small as herbs for the pot.”","“嘿，割草的，如果你们不告诉国王这片地是属于卡拉巴斯侯爵大人的话，你们就会被剁成肉酱。”"
"The King did not fail asking of the mowers to whom the meadow they were mowing belonged.","国王果然问起他们这片收割中的土地是属于谁的。"
"“To my Lord Marquis of Carabas,” answered they altogether, for the Cat’s threats had made them terribly afraid.","“是属于卡拉巴斯侯爵大人的。”他们齐声答道，因为猫咪的恐吓着实把他们吓坏了。"
"“You see, sir,” said the Marquis, “this is a meadow which never fails to yield a plentiful harvest every year.”","“您看，陛下，”侯爵说，“这片地年年都会大获丰收。”"
"The Master Cat, who went still on before, met with some reapers, and said to them:","仍旧跑在前方的猫咪，碰到了一群收割者，它对他们说："
"“Good people, you who are reaping, if you do not tell the King that all this corn belongs to the Marquis of Carabas, you shall be chopped as small as herbs for the pot.”","“喂，收割的，如果你们不告诉国王这所有的玉米都是属于卡拉巴斯侯爵的话，你们就会被剁成肉酱。”"
"The King, who passed by a moment after, would needs know to whom all that corn, which he then saw, did belong.","过了一会国王经过此处，看到了那片玉米地，果然问是属于谁的。"
"“To my Lord Marquis of Carabas,” replied the reapers, and the King was very well pleased with it, as well as the Marquis, whom he congratulated thereupon.","“属于卡拉巴斯侯爵大人的。”收割者们回答道，国王对此十分满意，对侯爵也是如此，并为此称赞了他一番。"
"The Master Cat, who went always before, said the same words to all he met, and the King was astonished at the vast estates of my Lord Marquis of Carabas.","猫咪一直跑在前面，对它看到的所有人都说同样的话，国王为“卡拉巴斯侯爵大人”所拥有的庞大财产而惊讶不已。"
"Monsieur Puss came at last to a stately castle, the master of which was an ogre, the richest had ever been known; for all the lands which the King had then gone over belonged to this castle.","猫绅士最后来到了一座富丽堂皇的城堡，城堡的主人是一头食人怪，他是有史以来最有钱的人，因为国王所经过的所有的土地都属于这座城堡。"
"The Cat, who had taken care to inform himself who this ogre was and what he could do, asked to speak with him, saying he could not pass so near his castle without having the honor of paying his respects to him.","猫咪打听清楚这位食人怪的身份还有他的能力之后，要求跟他见面，说自己都到城堡跟前了，不拜访一下主人，会显得很失礼。"
"The ogre received him as civilly as an ogre could do, and made him sit down.","食人怪尽可能客气地接见了它，并请它坐下。"
"“I have been assured,” said the Cat, “that you have the gift of being able to change yourself into all sorts of creatures you have a mind to; you can, for example, transform yourself into a lion, or elephant, and the like.”","“我听说，”猫咪道，“您有能力变成各种您想变成的生物，比如，您可以将自己变成一头狮子、大象或者其他类似的。”"
"“That is true,” answered the ogre very briskly; “and to convince you, you shall see me now become a lion.”","“没错，”食人怪尖刻地说，“为了让你确信，我现在就给你看我变成一头狮子。”"
"Puss was so sadly terrified at the sight of a lion so near him that he immediately got into the gutter, not without abundance of trouble and danger, because of his boots, which were of no use at all to him in walking upon the tiles.","猫咪被眼前狮子的景象吓了一大跳，顿时跳到屋顶上，由于穿着靴子，走起来既麻烦又危险，它根本无法在屋檐上行走。"
"A little while after, when Puss saw that the ogre had resumed his natural form, he came down, and owned he had been very much frightened.","过了一小会，猫咪看到食人怪变回原形，就下来了，并承认自己害怕极了。"
"“I have been, moreover, informed,” said the Cat, “but I know not how to believe it, that you have also the power to take on you the shape of the smallest animals; for example, to change yourself into a rat or a mouse; but I must own to you I take this to be impossible.”","“我还听说，”猫咪又道，“但我不知该如何相信，那就是您还有能力将自己变成那些最小的动物，比如说老鼠或者鼹鼠，但我必须承认，我认为这不可能。”"
"“Impossible!” cried the ogre; “you shall see that presently.”","“不可能？”食人怪吼道，“我现在就变给你看。”"
"And at the same time he changed himself into a mouse, and began to run about the floor.","话音刚落，他马上就变成一只老鼠，并开始在地板上跑来跑去。"
"Puss no sooner perceived this but he fell upon him and ate him up.","猫咪立刻反应过来，它扑了上去，把老鼠吃掉了。"
"Meanwhile the King, who saw, as he passed, this fine castle of the ogre’s, had a mind to go into it.","与此同时，国王经过此处，看到了食人怪的这座气派的城堡，他想要进来。"
"Puss, who heard the noise of his Majesty’s coach running over the draw-bridge, ran out, and said to the King:","猫咪听到了他的马车过桥的声音，它跑了出去，对国王说："
"“Your Majesty is welcome to this castle of my Lord Marquis of Carabas.”","“欢迎陛下您光临卡拉巴斯侯爵大人的城堡。”"
"“What! my Lord Marquis,” cried the King, “and does this castle also belong to you?","“什么！我的侯爵哟，”国王喊道，“这座城堡也是你的吗？"
"There can be nothing finer than this court and all the stately buildings which surround it; let us go into it, if you please.”","“这座宫殿和周围的建筑简直美妙极了，如果你们愿意的话，我们进去看看。”"
"The Marquis gave his hand to the Princess, and followed the King, who went first.","“侯爵”伸手牵住了公主，跟在先进去的国王后面。"
"They passed into a spacious hall, where they found a magnificent collation, which the ogre had prepared for his friends, who were that very day to visit him, but dared not to enter, knowing the King was there.","他们进入一个宽敞的大殿，在那里看到了一桌丰盛的酒席，那是食人怪为当天要来做客的朋友们准备的，但他们知道国王在里面，就不敢进来了。"
"His Majesty was perfectly charmed with the good qualities of my Lord Marquis of Carabas, as was his daughter, who had fallen violently in love with him, and, seeing the vast estate he possessed, said to him, after having drunk five or six glasses:","国王被“侯爵”优秀的品质深深打动，他看到女儿已经不可抑制地爱上了他，同时他还拥有的如此巨大的财富，喝了四五杯酒之后，国王对“侯爵”说："
"“It will be owing to yourself only, my Lord Marquis, if you are not my son-in-law.”","“我的侯爵，你愿不愿意做我的女婿，现在完全由你决定。”"
"The Marquis, making several low bows, accepted the honor which his Majesty conferred upon him, and forthwith, that very same day, married the Princess.","“侯爵”向国王深深地鞠了几躬，接受了国王赐予的荣幸，并在当天即刻与公主举行了婚礼。"
"Puss became a great lord, and never ran after mice any more but only for his diversion. ","猫咪也成为了大人物，并且再也不追着老鼠跑了，即使偶尔一次，也只是为了消遣而已。　"
