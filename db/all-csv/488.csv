"Cinderrela, or the Little Glass Slipper","灰姑娘，或小玻璃鞋"
"by Andrew Lang","作者：安德鲁·朗格"
"Once there was a gentleman who married, for his second wife, the proudest and most haughty woman that was ever seen.","从前有一位绅士，再婚时娶了一位闻所未闻的非常自大、非常傲慢的女人。"
"She had, by a former husband, two daughters of her own humor, who were, indeed, exactly like her in all things.","她和前夫生的两个女儿完全继承了她的秉性，什么地方都像她。"
"He had likewise, by another wife, a young daughter, but of unparalleled goodness and sweetness of temper, which she took from her mother, who was the best creature in the world.","绅士的前妻同样给他留下了一个女儿，这个女孩很年轻，更是无与伦比的温柔善良，这一点可是遗传自她过世的母亲——这世上最好的女人。"
"No sooner were the ceremonies of the wedding over but the mother-in-law began to show herself in her true colors.","婚后没过多久，这位继母就露出真面目了。"
"She could not bear the good qualities of this pretty girl, and the less because they made her own daughters appear the more odious.","她无法忍受这位漂亮姑娘的好品德，因为这会让她自己的两个女儿相形见绌，显得更令人讨厌。"
"She employed her in the meanest work of the house: she scoured the dishes, tables, etc., and scrubbed madam’s chamber, and those of misses, her daughters; she lay up in a sorry garret, upon a wretched straw bed, while her sisters lay in fine rooms, with floors all inlaid, upon beds of the very newest fashion, and where they had looking-glasses so large that they might see themselves at their full length from head to foot.","她把家里最脏最累的活全扔给这位可怜的姑娘：她既要刷碟子、擦桌子，又要打扫这位夫人和她那两位千金大小姐的卧室；她住在寒碜的阁楼里，睡在铺着稻草的床上，而她的两位姐姐则住在豪华房间里，地上铺着镶花地板，上面摆放着最新款式的床，还有可以照见全身的大镜子。"
"The poor girl bore all patiently, and dared not tell her father, who would have rattled her off; for his wife governed him entirely.","这个可怜的姑娘耐心地忍受这一切，不敢向她父亲诉苦，就算是告诉了估计也是挨一顿骂，因为他完全听命于他的妻子。"
"When she had done her work, she used to go into the chimney-corner, and sit down among cinders and ashes, which made her commonly be called Cinderwench; but the youngest, who was not so rude and uncivil as the eldest, called her Cinderella.","她干完活的时候，总要走到壁炉的角落里，坐在炉灰上面，因此全家人一般都叫她灰堆里的村姑。不过二姐没有大姐那么无礼，只是叫她灰姑娘。"
"However, Cinderella, notwithstanding her mean apparel, was a hundred times handsomer than her sisters, though they were always dressed very richly.","不过，虽然灰姑娘穿着寒酸的衣服，却还是比那两个总是衣着华丽的姐姐好看一百倍。"
"It happened that the King’s son gave a ball, and invited all persons of fashion to it.","恰巧国王的儿子要举办舞会，他邀请了所有时髦的人物参加。"
"Our young misses were also invited, for they cut a very grand figure among the quality.","我们这两位千金大小姐也受到了邀请，因为她们在上流社会出尽风头。"
"They were mightily delighted at this invitation, and wonderfully busy in choosing out such gowns, petticoats, and head-clothes as might become them.","这一邀请让她俩异常高兴，立即忙着挑选适合自己的礼服、衬裙和头饰。"
"This was a new trouble to Cinderella; for it was she who ironed her sisters’ linen, and plaited their ruffles; they talked all day long of nothing but how they should be dressed.","这对于灰姑娘而言可是个新麻烦，因为她不得不为两位姐姐熨好衣服，折好褶边。而她们呢，整天都在谈论着该怎么打扮。"
"“For my part,” said the eldest, “I will wear my red velvet suit with French trimming.”","“我嘛，”大姐说道，“我要穿那套红色天鹅绒礼服，再配上法国首饰。”"
"“And I,” said the youngest, “shall have my usual petticoat; but then, to make amends for that, I will put on my gold-flowered manteau, and my diamond stomacher, which is far from being the most ordinary one in the world.”","“而我呢，”二姐说道，“我要穿那件样式普通的衬裙，不过为了弥补它的不足，我会套上那件镶了金花的披风，再配上那绝非平常之物的宝石胸衣。”"
"They sent for the best tire-woman they could get to make up their head-dresses and adjust their double pinners, and they had their red brushes and patches from Mademoiselle de la Poche.","她们请来最能干的梳化侍女为她们装扮头发，整理双面头巾，再用上腮红刷和从波希小姐那里弄来的饰颜片。"
"Cinderella was likewise called up to them to be consulted in all these matters, for she had excellent notions, and advised them always for the best, nay, and offered her services to dress their heads, which they were very willing she should do.","灰姑娘也被叫来替她们出主意，因为她有着很好的想法，总是给她俩提供最好的建议，甚至还亲自为她们梳头，这可是她俩巴不得的。"
"As she was doing this, they said to her:","灰姑娘帮她们梳头时，她们问她："
"“Cinderella, would you not be glad to go to the ball?”","“灰姑娘，你不乐意参加王子的舞会么？”"
"“Alas!” said she, “you only jeer me; it is not for such as I am to go thither.”","“唉！你们开我玩笑吧，那可不是我这种人可以去的地方呀！”灰姑娘回答道。"
"“Thou art in the right of it,” replied they; “it would make the people laugh to see a Cinderwench at a ball.”","“你说的对极了，”她们讽刺道，“要是人们看到一个从灰堆里出来的村姑参加舞会，肯定会笑掉大牙的。”"
"Anyone but Cinderella would have dressed their heads awry, but she was very good, and dressed them perfectly well. They were almost two days without eating, so much were they transported with joy.","要是换了别人，肯定会把她们的头饰戴歪，但是灰姑娘很善良，还是把它们戴得十分完美。她俩差不多两天没吃东西，因为实在太高兴了。"
"They broke above a dozen laces in trying to be laced up close, that they might have a fine slender shape, and they were continually at their looking-glass.","两姐妹弄断了不止一打蕾丝就为了让腰束得更紧，显得身材更苗条，她们在镜子前徘徊流连，自我欣赏着。"
"At last the happy day came; they went to Court, and Cinderella followed them with her eyes as long as she could, and when she had lost sight of them, she fell a-crying.","开心的日子终于来临，两姐妹出发去皇宫里。灰姑娘久久目送她们离去，直到瞧不见她们的背影才痛哭起来。"
"Her godmother, who saw her all in tears, asked her what was the matter.","她的教母看见她在哭，便询问她发生什么事了。"
"“I wish I could—I wish I could—”; she was not able to speak the rest, being interrupted by her tears and sobbing.","“我好想我可以——我好想我可以——”她不断抽泣着，以致没法讲完后面的话。"
"This godmother of hers, who was a fairy, said to her, “Thou wishest thou couldst go to the ball; is it not so?”","她的教母是位仙女，猜透了她的心事，便对她说：“你很想去参加舞会，对不对？”"
"“Y—es,” cried Cinderella, with a great sigh.","“是的。”灰姑娘叹着气说。"
"“Well,” said her godmother, “be but a good girl, and I will contrive that thou shalt go.”","“那好，”她的教母说，“你是个好姑娘，我会帮你去那儿的。”"
"Then she took her into her chamber, and said to her, “Run into the garden, and bring me a pumpkin.”","接着，教母把她带回自己的房间，对她说道：“你快去菜园给我摘个南瓜回来！”"
"Cinderella went immediately to gather the finest she could get, and brought it to her godmother, not being able to imagine how this pumpkin could make her go to the ball.","灰姑娘赶紧冲去菜园，摘了个最好的南瓜回来给教母，但却想不明白这个南瓜如何能让她去参加舞会。"
"Her godmother scooped out all the inside of it, having left nothing but the rind; which done, she struck it with her wand, and the pumpkin was instantly turned into a fine coach, gilded all over with gold.","教母把南瓜舀空，只留了个外壳，之后用她的魔杖轻轻一点，南瓜瞬间变成了一辆镀满金子的豪华马车。"
"She then went to look into her mouse-trap, where she found six mice, all alive, and ordered Cinderella to lift up a little the trapdoor, when, giving each mouse, as it went out, a little tap with her wand, the mouse was that moment turned into a fine horse, which altogether made a very fine set of six horses of a beautiful mouse-colored dapple-gray.","她接着走到捕鼠器旁边，看到那里有六只活蹦乱跳的小老鼠。于是就叫灰姑娘把捕鼠器的活板门稍稍抬起一点儿，每溜出一只老鼠，她就用魔杖轻点一下，一眨眼的工夫小老鼠都变成了一匹骏马。六匹带有美丽的鼠灰色斑点的骏马组成了一支非常气派的马队。"
"Being at a loss for a coachman,","正当教母为车夫发愁时，"
"“I will go and see,” says Cinderella, “if there is never a rat in the rat-trap—we may make a coachman of him.”","灰姑娘说道：“我去看看大捕鼠器里有没有老鼠，要是有的话，就用它做车夫吧！”"
"“Thou art in the right,” replied her godmother; “go and look.”","“好主意，”她的教母回道，“快去看看吧！”"
"Cinderella brought the trap to her, and in it there were three huge rats.","灰姑娘搬来大捕鼠器，里面有三只大老鼠呢！"
"The fairy made choice of one of the three which had the largest beard, and, having touched him with her wand, he was turned into a fat, jolly coachman, who had the smartest whiskers eyes ever beheld.","仙女从三只老鼠中挑了一只长着大胡子的，然后用魔杖点了它一下，这只老鼠马上就变成一个胖胖的可爱车夫，长着从没见过的漂亮胡子。"
"After that, she said to her:","之后，她对灰姑娘说："
"“Go again into the garden, and you will find six lizards behind the watering-pot, bring them to me.”"

"“你再去一趟菜园，洒水壶后面有六只蜥蜴，你把它们捉来给我。”"
"She had no sooner done so but her godmother turned them into six footmen, who skipped up immediately behind the coach, with their liveries all bedaubed with gold and silver, and clung as close behind each other as if they had done nothing else their whole lives.","她刚把蜥蜴捉过来，教母就把它们变成了六个侍从。他们身穿镶满金银的制服，很快在马车后面整整齐齐地排好队伍，一个挨着一个，仿佛他们这辈子就没做过别的事情一样。"
"The Fairy then said to Cinderella:","仙女接着对灰姑娘说："
"“Well, you see here an equipage fit to go to the ball with; are you not pleased with it?”","“好了，参加舞会需要的马车侍从都有了，你不喜欢吗？”"
"“Oh! yes,” cried she; “but must I go thither as I am, in these nasty rags?”","“我可喜欢呢！”她哭着说道，“可是我难道就穿着这身破破烂烂的衣服去参加舞会吗？”"
"Her godmother only just touched her with her wand, and, at the same instant, her clothes were turned into cloth of gold and silver, all beset with jewels.","她的教母只是用魔杖轻点了她一下，一眨眼，她的衣服就变成了镶满珠宝的金银丝线制成的华丽礼服。"
"This done, she gave her a pair of glass slippers, the prettiest in the whole world.","接着，教母送给了她一双世界上最美丽的玻璃鞋。"
"Being thus decked out, she got up into her coach; but her godmother, above all things, commanded her not to stay till after midnight, telling her, at the same time, that if she stayed one moment longer, the coach would be a pumpkin again, her horses mice, her coachman a rat, her footmen lizards, and her clothes become just as they were before.","刚一装扮好，她就登上了马车。但是教母再三叮咛她，千万不要呆到超过午夜十二点，哪怕她只是在舞会上多呆一下子，马车也会变回南瓜，马和车夫也会变回老鼠，侍从也会变回蜥蜴，衣服也会变回从前那样。"
"She promised her godmother she would not fail of leaving the ball before midnight; and then away she drives, scarce able to contain herself for joy.","她答应教母一定会在午夜前离开舞会。接着她出发了，兴奋得不能自已。"
"The King’s son who was told that a great princess, whom nobody knew, was come, ran out to receive her; he gave her his hand as she alighted out of the coach, and led her into the ball, among all the company.","王子听说一位大家都不认识的公主大驾光临，赶紧出去迎接。他扶着她走下马车，领着她穿过客人来到舞会大厅。"
"There was immediately a profound silence, they left off dancing, and the violins ceased to play, so attentive was everyone to contemplate the singular beauties of the unknown new-comer.","大厅顿时变得鸦雀无声，人们停止跳舞，小提琴也停止演奏，大家都目不转睛地注视着这位新来的惊艳无比的陌生女子。"
"Nothing was then heard but a confused noise of:","之后，只听见很多唧唧喳喳的声音："
"“Ha! how handsome she is!","“啊！她真美丽呀！"
"Ha! how handsome she is!”","哇！她真是个大美人！”"
"The King himself, old as he was, could not help watching her, and telling the Queen softly that it was a long time since he had seen so beautiful and lovely a creature.","就连上了年纪的国王也情不自禁地注视着她。他还悄悄对王后说，自己已经很久没有见到这么美丽、可爱的姑娘了。"
"All the ladies were busied in considering her clothes and headdress, that they might have some made next day after the same pattern, provided they could meet with such fine material and as able hands to make them.","所有的贵妇都忙着打量她的衣服和发型，要是她们能找到同样上好的布料和同样手巧的裁缝，想必隔天就会出现一样的款式。"
"The King’s son conducted her to the most honorable seat, and afterward took her out to dance with him; she danced so very gracefully that they all more and more admired her.","王子请她坐到最尊贵的座位上，接着邀请她跳舞。她的舞姿优雅极了，人们更加对她倾心了。"
"A fine collation was served up, whereof the young prince ate not a morsel, so intently was he busied in gazing on her.","侍从端上可口的点心，但是王子一口也没吃，他一直目不转睛地注视着灰姑娘，顾不上其他了。"
"She went and sat down by her sisters, showing them a thousand civilities, giving them part of the oranges and citrons which the Prince had presented her with, which very much surprised them, for they did not know her.","灰姑娘走到她两个姐姐身边坐下来，对她俩特别客气，还把王子送给她的橙子和蜜饯分给她们，这可是让她俩惊讶不已，因为她们压根不认识她。"
"While Cinderella was thus amusing her sisters, she heard the clock strike eleven and three-quarters, whereupon she immediately made a courtesy to the company and hasted away as fast as she could.","当灰姑娘与她两位姐姐交谈甚欢的时候，大钟敲响了十一点三刻。她立即向众人辞行，然后飞速地离开舞会。"
"When she got home she ran to seek out her godmother, and, after having thanked her, she said she could not but heartily wish she might go next day to the ball, because the King’s son had desired her.","她一回到家就立马跑去找教母，向她表示感谢。之后，又说她是多么强烈地希望第二天能再去舞会，因为王子邀请过她了。"
"As she was eagerly telling her godmother whatever had passed at the ball, her two sisters knocked at the door, which Cinderella ran and opened.","正当她滔滔不绝地把舞会上发生的一切告诉教母的时候，她的两位姐姐敲门了。灰姑娘赶紧冲过去开门。"
"“How long you have stayed!”","“你们呆了那么久才回来呀！”"
"cried she, gaping, rubbing her eyes and stretching herself as if she had been just waked out of her sleep; she had not, however, any manner of inclination to sleep since they went from home.","她嚷道，跟着打着哈欠，揉揉眼睛，伸伸懒腰，似乎是刚睡醒的样子。其实，她们走后，她一刻也没有睡过。"
"“If thou hadst been at the ball,” said one of her sisters, “thou wouldst not have been tired with it.","“要是你去了舞会，”其中一位姐姐对她说，“你就不会感到厌倦了。"
"There came thither the finest princess, the most beautiful ever was seen with mortal eyes; she showed us a thousand civilities, and gave us oranges and citrons.”","今晚来了一位最漂亮的公主，人们还从未见过如此美丽的人儿呢！她对我们非常客气，还请我们吃橙子和蜜饯。”"
"Cinderella seemed very indifferent in the matter; indeed, she asked them the name of that princess; but they told her they did not know it, and that the King’s son was very uneasy on her account and would give all the world to know who she was.","灰姑娘装作漠不关心的样子，只是向她两位姐姐打听这位公主的名字，但是她们对她说，没人认识她，为此王子心急如焚，要不惜一切代价知道她是谁。"
"At this Cinderella, smiling, replied:","听到这些，灰姑娘不禁笑着答道："
"“She must, then, be very beautiful indeed; how happy you have been!","“她肯定非常美丽！你们真幸福呀！"
"Could not I see her?","我不能见见她吗？"
"Ah! dear Miss Charlotte, do lend me your yellow suit of clothes which you wear every day.”","呀！亲爱的夏洛特小姐，请把你天天都穿的那件黄衣服借我穿一下。”"
"“Ay, to be sure!” cried Miss Charlotte; “lend my clothes to such a dirty Cinderwench as thou art!","“哎！当然不行！”夏洛特小姐嚷嚷着，“把我的衣服借给像你这样脏兮兮的灰丫头，"
"I should be a fool.”","除非我疯了！”"
"Cinderella, indeed, expected well such answer, and was very glad of the refusal; for she would have been sadly put to it if her sister had lent her what she asked for jestingly.","灰姑娘事实上正期望这样的回答，她很高兴姐姐拒绝了，因为如果她的姐姐当真愿意借衣服给她，她反而会不知所措，这只是她开玩笑问问罢了。"
"The next day the two sisters were at the ball, and so was Cinderella, but dressed more magnificently than before.","第二天，她的两个姐姐又去参加舞会，灰姑娘也去了，不过她打扮得比第一天还要华丽。"
"The King’s son was always by her, and never ceased his compliments and kind speeches to her; to whom all this was so far from being tiresome that she quite forgot what her godmother had recommended to her; so that she, at last, counted the clock striking twelve when she took it to be no more than eleven; she then rose up and fled, as nimble as a deer.","王子一直和她呆在一起，嘴里不停地对她说着赞美之词。这些话听起来一点儿也不让人感到厌烦，以致灰姑娘忘了教母对她的叮咛。所以最后当午夜的钟声敲响的时候，她还以为不到十一点儿呢。她立即起身，像小鹿一样矫捷地逃走了。"
"The Prince followed, but could not overtake her.","王子跟了出来，但是却追不上她。"
"She left behind one of her glass slippers, which the Prince took up most carefully.","慌忙之中，她落下了一只玻璃鞋，王子小心翼翼地把它拾了起来。"
"She got home but quite out of breath, and in her nasty old clothes, having nothing left her of all her finery but one of the little slippers, fellow to that she dropped.","她上气不接下气地到了家，穿的还是之前破破烂烂的衣服，先前那一身华丽的装束如今只剩下一只玻璃鞋，有一只被她落在了皇宫。"
"The guards at the palace gate were asked:","皇宫门前的守卫被询问道："
"If they had not seen a princess go out.","是否看见一位公主跑了出来。"
"Who said: They had seen nobody go out but a young girl, very meanly dressed, and who had more the air of a poor country wench than a gentlewoman.","他们说，他们只看见一个穿得破破烂烂的小女孩跑了出来，看上去与其说是一位千金小姐倒不如说是一个穷酸的乡下姑娘。"
"When the two sisters returned from the ball Cinderella asked them: If they had been well diverted, and if the fine lady had been there.","当她那两位姐姐从舞会上回来的时候，灰姑娘问她们是不是跟之前一样玩得很开心，那位漂亮姑娘是不是又出现在舞会上。"
"They told her: Yes, but that she hurried away immediately when it struck twelve, and with so much haste that she dropped one of her little glass slippers, the prettiest in the world, which the King’s son had taken up; that he had done nothing but look at her all the time at the ball, and that most certainly he was very much in love with the beautiful person who owned the glass slipper.","她们回答说是的，但是午夜钟声刚敲响，她就匆匆离开了，慌忙之中她落下了一只玻璃鞋，那可是世界上最漂亮的鞋子。她们还提到，王子自捡到那只鞋后，就一直盯着它，直到舞会结束。他一定非常爱玻璃鞋那美丽的主人。"
"What they said was very true; for a few days after the King’s son caused it to be proclaimed, by sound of trumpet, that he would marry her whose foot the slipper would just fit.","她们说的一点儿也没错，因为几天后，王子便用喇叭宣布说，哪位姑娘的脚能穿进玻璃鞋，他就娶她为妻。"
"They whom he employed began to try it upon the princesses, then the duchesses and all the Court, but in vain; it was brought to the two sisters, who did all they possibly could to thrust their foot into the slipper, but they could not effect it.","王子的手下开始让公主们试鞋，之后是公爵夫人和宫中所有人，但是没有一个人合适。之后他们又将鞋带去两姐妹家里，她们想尽一切办法要将脚塞进这只鞋里，不过都失败了。"
"Cinderella, who saw all this, and knew her slipper, said to them, laughing:","灰姑娘看着这一切，认出那是自己的鞋，便笑着说道："
"“Let me see if it will not fit me.”","“我多想试试看它合不合我的脚啊！”"
"Her sisters burst out a-laughing, and began to banter her.","她的两位姐姐马上大笑起来，开始挖苦她。"
"The gentleman who was sent to try the slipper looked earnestly at Cinderella, and, finding her very handsome, said:","负责试鞋的侍从仔细看了看灰姑娘，发现她长得很漂亮，便说："
"It was but just that she should try, and that he had orders to let everyone make trial.","应该要让她试试，因为他受命要让所有姑娘都一一试过。"
"He obliged Cinderella to sit down, and, putting the slipper to her foot, he found it went on very easily, and fitted her as if it had been made of wax.","他让灰姑娘坐下来，把那只鞋往她的脚上套，他发现鞋轻而易举地就穿了上去，非常合她脚，就跟定做的一样。"
"The astonishment her two sisters were in was excessively great, but still abundantly greater when Cinderella pulled out of her pocket the other slipper, and put it on her foot.","她的两位姐姐大为惊讶，不过当她们看见灰姑娘从口袋里掏出另一只鞋穿在脚上时，就更震惊了。"
"Thereupon, in came her godmother, who, having touched with her wand Cinderella’s clothes, made them richer and more magnificent than any of those she had before.","这时，教母进来了，她用魔杖在灰姑娘的衣服上轻轻一点，她的衣服瞬间变得比以往任何一套都要华丽。"
"And now her two sisters found her to be that fine, beautiful lady whom they had seen at the ball.","这会儿，她的两位姐姐终于认出她就是那位她们在舞会上见过的美人儿。"
"They threw themselves at her feet to beg pardon for all the ill-treatment they had made her undergo.","两姐妹突然跪倒在灰姑娘脚下，恳求她能原谅她们之前对她那么刻薄。"
"Cinderella took them up, and, as she embraced them, cried:","灰姑娘把她们扶了起来，一边拥抱她们，一边大声说，"
"That she forgave them with all her heart, and desired them always to love her.","她真心原谅她们，也希望她们能永远爱她。"
"She was conducted to the young prince, dressed as she was; he thought her more charming than ever, and, a few days after, married her.","灰姑娘穿着这身衣服来到王子面前，王子发现她比从前还要迷人。没过几天，王子便娶了她。"
"Cinderella, who was no less good than beautiful, gave her two sisters lodgings in the palace, and that very same day matched them with two great lords of the Court. ","善良又美丽的灰姑娘把两位姐姐也接进宫来住，进宫的当天就把她俩许给了宫里的两位达官贵人。"
