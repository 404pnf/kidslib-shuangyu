"第一章 住在“本博将军”旅店的老水手","Chapter1 The Old Sea-dog at the Admiral Benbow   "
"乡绅特里劳尼、利夫西医生和其他这些先生们早就想叫我把有关金银岛的全部细节写出来，从头到尾、毫无保留，除了金银岛的位置,那只是因为至今在那里还有没被挖出来的宝藏。于是我在一七几几年拿起笔来，回到过去我父亲开“本博将军”旅店的时候，那会儿那个褐色皮肤、脸上带着刀疤的老水手第一次住进了我们的旅店。我至今对他记忆犹新。当时他迈着沉重的步子来到旅店门前，他的水手储物箱就放在他身后的一个手推车上。他身材高大，强壮而结实，有着坚果般棕色的皮肤。他穿了一件脏兮兮的蓝色外套，粘乎乎的大辫子垂在肩膀上。他粗糙的双手布满了疤痕，指甲是黑的，还残缺不全。一道脏兮兮的铅灰色刀疤横贯他一侧的脸颊。我记得他一面环顾着小海湾，一面给自己吹着口哨，然后突然扯开嗓子唱起了那首后来他经常挂在嘴边的古老的水手歌：“十五个人站在聚魂棺上——呦——嗬——嗬——还有一瓶朗姆酒！”","SQUIRE TRELAWNEY, Dr.Livesey, and the rest of these gentlemen having asked me to write down the whole particulars about Treasure Island, from the beginning to the end, keeping nothing back but the bearings of the island,and that only because there is still treasure not yet lifted, I take up my pen in the year of grace 17—and go back to the time when my father kept the Admiral Benbow inn and the brown old seaman with the sabre cut first took up his lodging under our roof.I remember him as if it were yesterday, as he came plodding to the inn door, his sea-chest following behind him in a hand-barrow—a tall, strong, heavy, nut-brown man, his tarry pigtail falling over the shoulder of his soiled blue coat, his hands ragged and scarred, with black, broken nails, and the sabre cut across one cheek, a dirty, livid white.I remember him looking round the cove and whistling to himself as he did so, and then breaking out in that old sea-song that he sang so often afterwards: “Fifteen men on the dead man’s chest—Yo—ho—ho, and a bottle of rum!”"
"那苍老的声音高亢而颤抖，仿佛是按照船上的绞盘杆定的调，又按照它唱走了音。然后他用一根随身携带的类似绞盘棒的棍子重重地敲门，当我父亲出来时，他又粗鲁地要了一杯朗姆酒。酒端给他的时候，他慢慢地喝着，就像一个品酒师一样细细地品着，眼睛仍然望着悬崖，还有头上我们旅店的招牌。","In the high, old tottering voice that seemed to have been tuned and broken at the capstan bars.Then he rapped on the door with a bit of stick like a handspike that he carried, and when my father appeared, called roughly for a glass of rum.This, when it was brought to him, he drank slowly, like a connoisseur, lingering on the taste and still looking about him at the cliffs and up at our signboard."
"“这是个位置便利的小海湾，”他终于开口说道，“而且这个小酒店的位置也不错。客人多么，伙计？”","“This is a handy cove,” said he at length; “and a pleasant sittyated grog-shop.Much company, mate?”"
"我父亲告诉他，客人不多，遗憾的就是客人太少了。","My father told him no, very little company, the more was the pity."
"“那么，好吧，”他说，“这就是我停泊的住处了。伙计，到这来。”他朝推着手推车的人喊道，“把车子停到边上，帮我卸箱子。我要在这住些日子。”他继续说道，“我是个粗人，只要有朗姆酒、培根和鸡蛋就够了，当然还要那可以看着船起航的悬崖。你们该叫我什么呢？就叫我船长吧。哦，我知道你们什么意思了——看那儿。”他把三四个金币扔到门槛上。“用完了，你们就告诉我一声。”他说道，看起来严厉得像个指挥官。","“Well, then,” said he, “this is the berth for me. Here you, matey,” he cried to the man who trundled the barrow;“bring up alongside and help up my chest.I’ll stay here a bit,” he continued.“I’m a plain man; rum and bacon and eggs is what I want, and that head up there for to watch ships off.What you mought call me? You mought call me captain.Oh, I see what you’re at—there,” and he threw down three or four gold pieces on the threshold.“You can tell me when I’ve worked through that,” said he, looking as fierce as a commander."
"说实在的，尽管他衣衫褴褛，语言粗俗，但他的外表却根本不像一个在桅杆前航行的水手，倒像个习惯发号施令或者挥手动拳的大副或者船长。这个带着手推车的人告诉我们，邮车昨天早上把他送到“乔治王”旅店，他打听了岸边有什么旅店，我想他是听说我们的旅店名声很好，别人又都说这儿是个僻静的地方，于是就在众多旅店中选中了我们这家。这就是我们所能知道的关于这个客人的一切了。","And indeed bad as his clothes were and coarsely as he spoke, he had none of the appearance of a man who sailed before the mast, but seemed like a mate or skipper accustomed to be obeyed or to strike.The man who came with the barrow told us the mail had set him down the morning before at the Royal George, that he had inquired what inns there were along the coast, and hearing ours well spoken of, I suppose, and described as lonely, had chosen it from the others for his place of residence.And that was all we could learn of our guest."
"他是个生性非常沉默寡言的人。整个白天，他都带着一副铜制的望远镜，不是在海湾四周闲逛，就是在悬崖上游荡；整个晚上，他都坐在大厅壁炉旁的一个角落里，拼命地喝着掺着水的朗姆酒。如果有人和他说话，他大多数情况都不会回应，只是会突然抬起头来狠狠看一眼，像吹雾角一样哼一下鼻子。我们和到我们这里来的人们很快就学会随他去了。每天散步回来，他都会问有没有水手路过这里。起初我们觉得是缺少同类人的陪伴使他这么问的，但后来我们开始发现他是想要躲开他们。每当有水手投宿到“本博将军”旅店（时不时地会有一些水手来，途径这条沿海的路到布里斯托尔），他在进大厅前总会先隔着那扇带帘子的门观察一番。如果有这样的人在场，他必定会安静得像个耗子一样。对我来说，至少这件事情不算什么秘密，因为我多少也分担了他的惊恐。一天他把我叫到一边，答应我在每个月的第一天给我一枚四便士的银币，只要我“时刻留神一个独腿水手”，并且这个人一出现，就告诉他。每当月初到来，我向他要报酬的时候，他通常只会冲我把鼻子一哼，然后瞪得我不敢再看他。但不出一个星期，他一定会改变主意，把四便士银币给我，然后重新叮嘱我要我留神那个“独腿水手”。","He was a very silent man by custom.All day he hung round the cove or upon the cliffs with a brass telescope; all evening he sat in a corner of the parlour next the fire and drank rum and water very strong.Mostly he would not speak when spoken to, only look up sudden and fierce and blow through his nose like a fog-horn; and we and the people who came about our house soon learned to let him be.Every day when he came back from his stroll he would ask if any seafaring men had gone by along the road.At first we thought it was the want of company of his own kind that made him ask this question, but at last we began to see he was desirous to avoid them.When a seaman did put up at the Admiral Benbow (as now and then some did, making by the coast road for Bristol) he would look in at him through the curtained door before he entered the parlour; and he was always sure to be as silent as a mouse when any such was present.For me, at least, there was no secret about the matter, for I was, in a way, a sharer in his alarms.He had taken me aside one day and promised me a silver fourpenny on the first of every month if I would only keep my “weather-eye open for a seafaring man with one leg”and let him know the moment he appeared.Often enough when the first of the month came round and I applied to him for my wage, he would only blow through his nose at me and stare me down, but before the week was out he was sure to think better of it, bring me my fourpenny piece, and repeat his orders to look out for “the seafaring man with one leg”."
"那个独腿水手是如何萦绕在我的梦里的，我就不必多说了。在暴风雨夜，当狂风席卷屋子的四角，海浪咆哮着冲上海湾，跳上悬崖的时候，我就会看到一千个他的样子，带着一千种恶魔般的表情。一会是那条腿腿被齐膝砍断，一会儿是从臀部被砍断，一会他又成了一条腿长在在身体中间的怪物。看他跳过树篱和水沟跑着追赶我，是我做过的最糟糕的噩梦。总之，我为了每月的四便士付出了相当多的代价，受到这些可恶的想象的折磨。","How that personage haunted my dreams, I need scarcely tell you.On stormy nights, when the wind shook the four corners of the house and the surf roared along the cove and up the cliffs, I would see him in a thousand forms, and with a thousand diabolical expressions.Now the leg would be cut off at the knee, now at the hip; now he was a monstrous kind of a creature who had never had but the one leg, and that in the middle of his body.To see him leap and run and pursue me over hedge and ditch was the worst of nightmares.And altogether I paid pretty dear for my monthly fourpenny piece, in the shape of these abominable fancies."
"但是，尽管我被这个独腿水手的念头吓得够呛，这还远远比不上其他认识船长的人对他本人的害怕。有的夜晚，他喝下的掺水朗姆酒超过了他的脑袋所能承受的限度。然后，他有时会坐下，旁若无人地唱他那老掉牙的破水手歌人。但是有时候，他会请大家都喝上一杯，强迫那些吓得瑟瑟发抖的客人们听他讲故事或者跟着他一起唱歌。我常常听到整个屋子震动着，伴随着“呦——嗬——嗬——还有一瓶朗姆酒”的歌声，所有邻座的人为了宝贵的生命，连同他们对死亡的恐惧加入进来。每个人都唱得比别人更大声，以免被骂。因为在这些场合里，他是人们所知道的最重要的人。他会用手拍桌子要周围所有人安静；他会突然对被问到的一个问题大发雷霆，或者他有时候还会因为没有人问问题而认为大家没有在听他讲故事，同样大发雷霆。在他喝困了、跌跌撞撞地上床之前，他也不会允许任何人离开小旅店。","But though I was so terrified by the idea of the seafaring man with one leg, I was far less afraid of the captain himself than anybody else who knew him.There were nights when he took a deal more rum and water than his head would carry; and then he would sometimes sit and sing his wicked, old, wild sea-songs, minding nobody; but sometimes he would call for glasses round and force all the trembling company to listen to his stories or bear a chorus to his singing.Often I have heard the house shaking with “Yo—ho—ho, and a bottle of rum,”all the neighbours joining in for dear life, with the fear of death upon them, and each singing louder than the other to avoid remark.For in these fits he was the most overriding companion ever known; he would slap his hand on the table for silence all round; he would fly up in a passion of anger at a question, or sometimes because none was put, and so he judged the company was not following his story.Nor would he allow anyone to leave the inn till he had drunk himself sleepy and reeled off to bed."
"最让大家害怕的还是他的那些故事。那都是些让人恐怖的故事——关于绞刑、走木板、海上风暴、干燥的托尔图加斯、西班牙大陆上的野蛮行径和野蛮地区。根据他的叙述，他想必和上帝造出的最邪恶的一些人在海上过了一辈子。他讲这些故事所用的语言，几乎能和他描述的那些罪行一样，使我们这些平庸的乡下人震惊万分。我父亲总是说这个小旅店会被毁掉，因为人们很快将不再来这里忍受暴戾、压制、瑟瑟发抖地爬上床，但我却真心相信他的出现会给我们带来好处。人们当时被吓坏了，但是回头想想反倒更加喜欢了。因为这给平静的乡村生活带来了很好的刺激。甚至有一群年轻人装作崇拜他，称他为“真正的水手”、“真正的老水手”及其他诸如此类的称呼，还说正是因为有这样的人，英格兰才得以称霸海上。","His stories were what frightened people worst of all.Dreadful stories they were—about hanging, and walking the plank, and storms at sea, and the Dry Tortugas, and wild deeds and places on the Spanish Main.By his own account he must have lived his life among some of the wickedest men that God ever allowed upon the sea, and the language in which he told these stories shocked our plain country people almost as much as the crimes that he described.My father was always saying the inn would be ruined, for people would soon cease coming there to be tyrannized over and put down, and sent shivering to their beds; but I really believe his presence did us good.People were frightened at the time, but on looking back they rather liked it; it was a fine excitement in a quiet country life, and there was even a party of the younger men who pretended to admire him, calling him a “true sea-dog” and a “real old salt” and such like names, and saying there was the sort of man that made England terrible at sea."
"一方面来说，他的确也在毁灭着我们，因为他在这里住了一个星期又一个星期，最后是一个月又一个月，所有他付的钱早就花光了，可我父亲始终没有鼓起勇气坚持向他要更多的钱。如果我父亲一提起这件事，船长便会大声哼下鼻子，简直可以说是在咆哮，然后瞪着我可怜的父亲，吓得他退出房间。我曾见到父亲在一番回绝后痛苦地绞着他的双手。我确信，一定是这种恼怒和恐惧加速了他的不幸早逝。","In one way, indeed, he bade fair to ruin us, for he kept on staying week after week, and at last month after month, so that all the money had been long exhausted, and still my father never plucked up the heart to insist on having more.If ever he mentioned it, the captain blew through his nose so loudly that you might say he roared, and stared my poor father out of the room.I have seen him wringing his hands after such a rebuff, and I am sure the annoyance and the terror he lived in must have greatly hastened his early and unhappy death."
"船长和我们住在一起的日子里，从没有换过任何衣服，除了从小贩那里买过几双袜子。他帽子的一角耷拉了下来，从那天起他就让它一直那么耷拉着，尽管当风吹来的时候，它会使他极不舒服。我还记得他那件大衣的样子。他曾在楼上的房间亲自给它打过补丁，直到最后，这件衣服除了补丁，什么都不剩了。他从不写信，也从未收到过别人的来信，而且除了邻居他也从不和任何人说话，即使和这些人说话，大多数也只是在喝朗姆酒的时候。那个航海的大储物箱，我们也从没见到它打开过。","All the time he lived with us the captain made no change whatever in his dress but to buy some stockings from a hawker.One of the cocks of his hat having fallen down, he let it hang from that day forth, though it was a great annoyance when it blew.I remember the appearance of his coat, which he patched himself upstairs in his room, and which, before the end, was nothing but patches.He never wrote or received a letter, and he never spoke with any but the neighbours, and with these, for the most part, only when drunk on rum.The great sea-chest none of us had ever seen open."
"他只是有一次被顶撞过，那是他快离开旅店的日子，当时我可怜的父亲身体正每况愈下，已病入膏肓。一天傍晚，利夫西医生来看病人，吃了一点我母亲做的晚饭，然后走进大厅抽烟，直到他的马从小村子过来，因为我们“本博将军”老店没有马厩。我跟着他进了客厅。我记得看到这位整洁、鲜亮的医生，涂着雪白的粉，有着明亮的黑眼睛和令人愉悦的风度，同那些不受拘束的乡下佬，特别是和我们那粗鄙、笨拙、头脑迷糊的海盗比起来，简直有天壤之别。那位海盗正坐在大厅里，喝得烂醉，胳膊搭在桌子上。突然他——这位船长——又扯开嗓子唱起那首老掉牙的歌：“十五个人站在聚魂棺上——呦——嗬——嗬，还有一瓶朗姆酒！","He was only once crossed, and that was towards the end, when my poor father was far gone in a decline that took him off.Dr.Livesey came late one afternoon to see the patient, took a bit of dinner from my mother, and went into the parlour to smoke a pipe until his horse should come down from the hamlet, for we had no stabling at the old Benbow.I followed him in, and I remember observing the contrast the neat, bright doctor, with his powder as white as snow and his bright, black eyes and pleasant manners, made with the coltish country folk, and above all, with that filthy, heavy, bleared scarecrow of a pirate of ours, sitting, far gone in rum, with his arms on the table.Suddenly he—the captain, that is—began to pipe up his eternal song: “Fifteen men on the dead man’s chest—Yo—ho—ho, and a bottle of rum!"
"酒和魔鬼带走了其余的人——呦——嗬——嗬，还有一瓶朗姆酒！”","Drink and the devil had done for the rest—Yo—ho—ho, and a bottle of rum!”"
"我起初以为他歌中唱的“聚魂棺”就是他楼上的那个大箱子的样子，并且这个想法已经在我的噩梦里和那个独腿水手搅在了一起。但是这个时候，我们对这首歌都不是特别在意了。那个晚上，它只对利夫西医生是新鲜的，并且我也并没有在他身上察觉到应有的效果。因为他在和园丁老泰勒聊天的过程中，非常愤怒地抬头看了一下，接着又谈论起治疗风湿的新疗法。与此同时，船长逐渐被自己的音乐抖擞起精神来，最后他一掌拍在了他面前的桌子上，我们都明白这意味着要安静。所有人立刻都不再说话了，除了利夫西医生。他继续像刚才一样清晰、和蔼地说着，每一两个词之间都轻快地抽一口烟斗。船长瞪了他一会儿，又拍了一下桌子，眼睛瞪得更加凶狠，最后终于用恶狠狠的低沉声音咒骂道：“安静，甲板上下的人都给我安静！”","At first I had supposed “the dead man’s chest” to be that identical big box of his upstairs in the front room, and the thought had been mingled in my nightmares with that of the one-legged seafaring man.But by this time we had all long ceased to pay any particular notice to the song; it was new, that night, to nobody but Dr.Livesey, and on him I observed it did not produce an agreeable effect, for he looked up for a moment quite angrily before he went on with his talk to old Taylor, the gardener, on a new cure for the rheumatics.In the meantime, the captain gradually brightened up at his own music, and at last flapped his hand upon the table before him in a way we all knew to mean silence.The voices stopped at once, all but Dr.Livesey’s; he went on as before speaking clear and kind and drawing briskly at his pipe between every word or two.The captain glared at him for a while, flapped his hand again, glared still harder, and at last broke out with a villainous, low oath, “Silence, there, between decks!”"
"“你是在和我说话吗，先生？”医生说。当这个无赖用另一句咒骂告诉他是这样的时候，医生回答说：“我只对你说一件事，先生，那就是，如果你继续喝朗姆酒的话，世界上就会很快少一个无比肮脏的恶棍！”","“Were you addressing me, sir?” says the doctor; and when the ruffian had told him, with another oath, that this was so, “I have only one thing to say to you, sir,” replies the doctor, “that if you keep on drinking rum, the world will soon be quit of a very dirty scoundrel!”"
"老家伙的愤怒很可怕。他跳了起来，拿出并打开一把水手用的折叠小刀，搁在手掌上左右掂量着，威胁说要把医生钉到墙上去。","The old fellow’s fury was awful.He sprang to his feet, drew and opened a sailor’s clasp-knife, and balancing it open on the palm of his hand, threatened to pin the doctor to the wall."
"医生动都没动一下。他转过身来，用和刚才一样的语调，声音相当高，好让全屋子的人都能听到，但又像之前一样相当平静而坚定地对他说：“如果你不立刻把刀子放回你的口袋，我以我的名誉保证，你会在下一次巡回审判中被绞死。”","The doctor never so much as moved.He spoke to him as before, over his shoulder and in the same tone of voice, rather high, so that all the room might hear, but perfectly calm and steady: “If you do not put that knife this instant in your pocket, I promise, upon my honour, you shall hang at the next assizes.”"
"接着，他们展开了一场对视战，但是船长很快便败下阵来，收起他的武器，重新回到自己的座位，像一只挨了打的狗一样咕哝着。","Then followed a battle of looks between them, but the captain soon knuckled under, put up his weapon, and resumed his seat, grumbling like a beaten dog."
"“听着，先生，”医生继续说道，“既然我现在已经知道我的管辖区里有这么一个家伙，你尽可放心，我会日夜盯着你。我不只是一个医生，还是一个治安官。如果我听到一句抱怨你的话，哪怕只是像今晚一样的无礼，我都会立刻采取有效的措施，把你抓起来，赶出这里。就这样。”","“And now, sir,” continued the doctor, “since I now know there’s such a fellow in my district, you may count I’ll have an eye upon you day and night.I’m not a doctor only; I’m a magistrate; and if I catch a breath of complaint against you, if it’s only for a piece of incivility like tonight’s, I’ll take effectual means to have you hunted down and routed out of this.Let that suffice.”"
"之后不久，利夫西医生的马来到门前，他上马离开了，但是那天晚上船长一直保持着沉默，并且之后的许多晚上都是这样。","Soon after, Dr.Livesey’s horse came to the door and he rode away, but the captain held his peace that evening, and for many evenings to come."
"第二章 黑狗出现又消失了","Chapter 2 Black Dog Appears and Disappears "
"这件事情过去不久，便发生了第一桩神秘事件，使我们终于摆脱了船长。不过，正如你会看到的那样，这并未使我们摆脱掉有关他的事情。那是一个寒冷的冬天，下了很久的严霜，风也很大。很明显，我可怜的父亲几乎不可能看到春天了。他的病一天比一天重，店里的活都落在我母亲和我身上。我们忙得够呛，基本没工夫注意我们那位讨厌的客人。","It was not very long after this that there occurred the first of the mysterious events that rid us at last of the captain, though not, as you will see, of his affairs.It was a bitter cold winter, with long, hard frosts and heavy gales; and it was plain from the first that my poor father was little likely to see the spring.He sank daily, and my mother and I had all the inn upon our hands, and were kept busy enough without paying much regard to our unpleasant guest."
"那是一个一月的早上，很早——一个令人痛苦的有严霜的早晨——整个海湾覆盖着白霜，灰蒙蒙一片，波浪轻轻拍打在岩石上，太阳仍低悬在山顶，照到远远的海上。船长比平时起得还早，出发去了海边，他的短刀在旧蓝色外套的宽下摆下左右摇晃，铜制望远镜夹在他的胳膊底下，他的帽子斜歪着搭在脑袋上。我记得他大步走着的时候，呼吸像烟雾一样，我是在他转过大石块的时候听到了他最后发出的的声音——气愤地哼了一下鼻子——好像还在对利夫西医生有什么想法。","It was one January morning, very early—a pinching, frosty morning—the cove all grey with hoar-frost, the ripple lapping softly on the stones, the sun still low and only touching the hilltops and shining far to seaward.The captain had risen earlier than usual and set out down the beach, his cutlass swinging under the broad skirts of the old blue coat, his brass telescope under his arm, his hat tilted back upon his head.I remember his breath hanging like smoke in his wake as he strode off, and the last sound I heard of him as he turned the big rock was a loud snort of indignation, as though his mind was still running upon Dr.Livesey."
"那时候，母亲和父亲在楼上，我正在摆放早餐桌，等船长回来。突然大厅门开了，一个我从未见过的人出现在我眼前。他是一个面色苍白、身体肥壮的家伙，左手少了两根手指。虽然他带着短刀，但看上去不太像是个好斗的人。我一直在留意着水手，一条或两条腿的，可我记得这个人使我很困惑。他不像个水手，但身上却又带着海的气息。","Well, mother was upstairs with father and I was laying the breakfast-table against the captain’s return when the parlour door opened and a man stepped in on whom I had never set my eyes before.He was a pale, tallowy creature, wanting two fingers of the left hand, and though he wore a cutlass, he did not look much like a fighter.I had always my eye open for seafaring men, with one leg or two, and I remember this one puzzled me.He was not sailorly, and yet he had a smack of the sea about him too."
"我问能否为他效劳，他说他要朗姆酒；但是正当我要走出房间取朗姆酒时，他在一张桌子旁坐下，做了个手势叫我过去。我停在原地，手里还拿着纸巾。","I asked him what was for his service, and he said he would take rum; but as I was going out of the room to fetch it, he sat down upon a table and motioned me to draw near.I paused where I was, with my napkin in my hand."
"“过来，孩子。”他说，","“Come here, sonny,” said he."
"“走过来一点儿。”","“Come nearer here.”"
"我走近了一步。","I took a step nearer."
"“这儿的这张桌子是我同伴比尔的吗？”他带着恶意的目光问道。","“Is this here table for my mate Bill?” he asked with a kind of leer."
"我告诉他我不认识他的同伴比尔，这张桌子是给住在我们房子的一个叫做“船长”的人的。","I told him I did not know his mate Bill, and this was for a person who stayed in our house whom we called the captain."
"“哦，”他说，“我的同伴比尔好像也被叫做船长，很有可能。他的脸颊上有一个刀疤，而且性格很开朗，尤其是喝酒的时候，我的同伴比尔就是这样的。为了证明，我们可以指出，你们的船长的一侧脸颊有一处刀疤——我们还可以指出，如果你想知道的话，那个刀疤在右半边脸。哦，好啦！我已经告诉你了。现在，我的同伴比尔在这间房子里吗？”","“Well,” said he, “my mate Bill would be called the captain, as like as not.He has a cut on one cheek and a mighty pleasant way with him, particularly in drink, has my mate Bill.We’ll put it, for argument like, that your captain has a cut on one cheek—and we’ll put it, if you like, that that cheek’s the right one.Ah, well! I told you.Now, is my mate Bill in this here house?”"
"我告诉他，船长正在外面散步。","I told him he was out walking."
"“哪条路，孩子？他走的是哪条路？”","“Which way, sonny? Which way is he gone?”"
"于是，我指了指那块石头，告诉他船长可能会怎么回来、多久回来，还回答了其他的一些问题。“哦，”他说，“这对我的同伴比尔来说会和喝酒一样好。”","And when I had pointed out the rock and told him how the captain was likely to return, and how soon, and answered a few other questions, “Ah,” said he, “this’ll be as good as drink to my mate Bill.”"
"他说这些话的时候，脸上丝毫没表现出愉快的表情，而我自己也有理由认为这个陌生人认错了，即使假设他说的就是这个意思。不过这和我无关。再说，我自己也不知道该怎么办才好。这个陌生人一直在旅店里边转悠，盯着那个角落，像一只在等老鼠的猫。我一走出去到大路上，他立刻就会叫我回来。要是我没有像他想象的那样迅速服从，他饱含油脂的脸就会变得特别可怕，他会用足以让我跳起来的咒骂命令我进来。只要我一回来，他就回到原来的状态，半讨好、半嘲讽地拍拍我的肩膀，告诉我我是个好孩子，他很喜欢我。“我自己有个儿子，”他说，“简直和你一模一样。他是我全部的骄傲。但是对男孩子来说，最重要的是纪律，孩子——纪律。现在，要是你和比尔一起出海，你就不会站在那里被叫上两遍了——你肯定不会。这从来不是比尔的风格，也不是和他一起航海的人的风格。那边，肯定无疑，是我的同伴比尔，胳膊底下夹着一个小望远镜，上帝保佑，这肯定是他。你和我回客厅去，孩子，到门后边去，咱们要给比尔一个小小的惊喜——上帝保佑他，我再说一遍。”","The expression of his face as he said these words was not at all pleasant, and I had my own reasons for thinking that the stranger was mistaken, even supposing he meant what he said.But it was no affair of mine, I thought; and besides, it was difficult to know what to do.The stranger kept hanging about just inside the inn door, peering round the corner like a cat waiting for a mouse.Once I stepped out myself into the road, but he immediately called me back, and as I did not obey quick enough for his fancy, a most horrible change came over his tallowy face, and he ordered me in with an oath that made me jump.As soon as I was back again he returned to his former manner, half fawning, half sneering, patted me on the shoulder, told me I was a good boy and he had taken quite a fancy to me.“I have a son of my own,” said he, “as like you as two blocks, and he’s all the pride of my ‘art.But the great thing for boys is discipline, sonny—discipline.Now, if you had sailed along of Bill, you wouldn’t have stood there to be spoke to twice—not you.That was never Bill’s way, nor the way of such as sailed with him.And here, sure enough, is my mate Bill, with a spy-glass under his arm, bless his old ‘art, to be sure.You and me’ll just go back into the parlour, sonny, and get behind the door, and we’ll give Bill a little surprise—bless his ‘art, I say again.”"
"说着，陌生人跟我一起回到了客厅，让我躲在他身后的角落里。这样，我们就都被敞开的门挡住了。你们可以想象，我既不安又惊慌，看到这个陌生人自己也很害怕，我就更恐惧了。他擦了擦短刀的刀柄，又松了松护套里的刀刃。我们在那儿等的时候，他一直在咽口水，仿佛我们通常所说的如鲠在喉。","So saying, the stranger backed along with me into the parlour and put me behind him in the corner so that we were both hidden by the open door.I was very uneasy and alarmed, as you may fancy, and it rather added to my fears to observe that the stranger was certainly frightened himself.He cleared the hilt of his cutlass and loosened the blade in the sheath; and all the time we were waiting there he kept swallowing as if he felt what we used to call a lump in the throat."
"终于，船长迈着大步走了进来，砰地一声关上身后的门，没有向左右两边看一眼，径直穿过房间到为他的早餐那里。","At last in strode the captain, slammed the door behind him, without looking to the right or left, and marched straight across the room to where his breakfast awaited him."
"“比尔。”那个陌生人喊道。那种声音，我认为，是他想为自己壮胆。","“Bill,” said the stranger in a voice that I thought he had tried to make bold and big."
"船长转过身来对着我们，脸上的褐色全都不见了，连鼻子都青了。他看起来像看到了一个幽灵，或者一个恶魔，或者是更可怕的东西，如果还有这个东西的话。而对于我，看到他刹那间变得如此苍老和衰弱，我感到很内疚。","The captain spun round on his heel and fronted us; all the brown had gone out of his face, and even his nose was blue; he had the look of a man who sees a ghost, or the evil one, or something worse, if anything can be; and upon my word, I felt sorry to see him all in a moment turn so old and sick."
"“来，比尔，你认得我。你认得这个老船友，比尔，这是当然的。”那个陌生人说。","“Come, Bill, you know me; you know an old shipmate, Bill, surely,” said the stranger."
"船长发出一声叹息。","The captain made a sort of gasp."
"“黑狗！”他说。","“Black Dog!” said he."
"“还能有谁呢？”另一个答道，变得轻松了一些。“黑狗和以前一样，来看他的老船友比尔来了，在‘本博将军’旅店。哦，比尔，比尔，我们都目睹了时光的流逝，我们两个，自从我丢了两根手指。”他举起自己残缺的手。","“And who else?” returned the other, getting more at his ease.“Black Dog as ever was, come for to see his old shipmate Billy, at the Admiral Benbow inn.Ah, Bill, Bill, we have seen a sight of times, us two, since I lost them two talons,” holding up his mutilated hand."
"“现在，看呐，”船长说道，“你已经找到我了，我就在这里，那么，说吧，什么事？”","“Now, look here,” said the captain; “you’ve run me down; here I am; well, then, speak up; what is it?”"
"“是你，比尔。”黑狗回答道，“你说得对，比尔。我想从这个可爱的孩子这儿要杯朗姆酒，因为我已经有了这个嗜好。如果你愿意的话，咱们就坐下，像老船友一样实实在在地聊聊。”","“That’s you, Bill,” returned Black Dog, “you’re in the right of it, Billy.I’ll have a glass of rum from this dear child here, as I’ve took such a liking to; and we’ll sit down, if you please, and talk square, like old shipmates.”"
"当我拿着朗姆酒回来的时候，他们已经坐在船长的早餐桌两边——黑狗挨着门，朝一边斜坐着，一是为了能看到他的老船友，另外我想，也是为了给自己留个退路。","When I returned with the rum, they were already seated on either side of the captain’s breakfast-table—Black Dog next to the door and sitting sideways so as to have one eye on his old shipmate and one, as I thought, on his retreat."
"他让我走开，并且把门大敞着。“别想从钥匙孔里偷看，孩子。”他说。于是我让他们呆在一起，自己回到酒吧间里。","He bade me go and leave the door wide open.“None of your keyholes for me, sonny,” he said; and I left them together and retired into the bar."
"很长一段时间，尽管我尽力去偷听，但除了低低的嘟囔声还是听不到一点声音。但最终声音开始越来越高，我能够听到一两句话了，大多是来自船长的咒骂。","For a long time, though I certainly did my best to listen, I could hear nothing but a low gattling; but at last the voices began to grow higher, and I could pick up a word or two, mostly oaths, from the captain."
"“不，不，不，不，到此为止吧！”他喊了一声。然后他又喊了一声：“如果要上绞刑架，就大家就都上，我说的。”","“No, no, no, no; and an end of it!” he cried once.And again, “If it comes to swinging, swing all, say I.”"
"接着就爆发出突如其来的咒骂和其他噪音——椅子和桌子倒在了一团，接着是金属的撞击，然后是一声惨叫。接下来，我看到黑狗拼命地逃跑，船长紧追其后，两个人都拔出了短刀，前者左肩流着血。就在门口，船长瞄准这个亡命徒，使劲儿给了他最后一刀。要不是我们“本博旅店”的大招牌挡着，这一刀准能把他劈成两半。到现在，你都还可以看到边框下边的那个缺口。","Then all of a sudden there was a tremendous explosion of oaths and other noises—the chair and table went over in a lump, a clash of steel followed, and then a cry of pain, and the next instant I saw Black Dog in full flight, and the captain hotly pursuing, both with drawn cutlasses, and the former streaming blood from the left shoulder.Just at the door the captain aimed at the fugitive one last tremendous cut, which would certainly have split him to the chine had it not been intercepted by our big signboard of Admiral Benbow.You may see the notch on the lower side of the frame to this day."
"这是那场战斗的最后一击。一出来到了路上，黑狗尽管受了伤，仍然显示出非凡的脚下功夫，不到半分钟，就消失在小山的脚下了。船长则站在那里盯着招牌，像一个茫然困惑的人。然后他揉了几下眼睛，最后转身回到屋里。","That blow was the last of the battle.Once out upon the road, Black Dog, in spite of his wound, showed a wonderful clean pair of heels and disappeared over the edge of the hill in half a minute.The captain, for his part, stood staring at the signboard like a bewildered man.Then he passed his hand over his eyes several times and at last turned back into the house."
"“吉姆，”他说，“朗姆酒。”他说话时，有些摇晃，便用一只手扶墙支撑住自己。","“Jim,” said he, “rum”; and as he spoke, he reeled a little, and caught himself with one hand against the wall."
"“你受伤了么？”我叫道。","“Are you hurt?” cried I."
"“朗姆酒。”他重复道。“我必须离开这里。朗姆酒！朗姆酒！”","“Rum,” he repeated.“I must get away from here.Rum! Rum!”"
"我跑去拿酒，但是所有发生的一切让我非常不安。我打碎了一个杯子，弄脏了塞子，并且在我回来的路上时，我听到大厅里一声巨大的倒地声，于是我跑进去，看到船长整个人躺在地板上。就在这时，我的母亲被喊叫声和打斗声惊动，跑下楼来帮我。我们两个人一起抬起他的脑袋。他大声地用力喘着气，但是他的眼睛是闭着的，脸色很吓人。","I ran to fetch it, but I was quite unsteadied by all that had fallen out, and I broke one glass and fouled the tap, and while I was still getting in my own way, I heard a loud fall in the parlour, and running in, beheld the captain lying full length upon the floor.At the same instant my mother, alarmed by the cries and fighting, came running downstairs to help me.Between us we raised his head.He was breathing very loud and hard, but his eyes were closed and his face a horrible colour."
"“哦，我的天呐，”我的母亲叫道，“这屋子真是倒霉！你可怜的父亲也病了。”","“Dear, deary me,” cried my mother, “What a disgrace upon the house! And your poor father sick!”"
"这时候，我们也不知道该怎么帮船长，而且除了知道他是在和陌生人混战的时候得了这个致命伤以外，我们对其他的事也一无所知。我的确拿来了朗姆酒，并试图把它灌进他的喉咙，但是他的牙关紧闭，下巴也坚硬得像铁一样。等到门被打开，利夫西医生进来探望我的父亲时，我们都高兴地松了口气。","In the meantime, we had no idea what to do to help the captain, nor any other thought but that he had got his death-hurt in the scuffle with the stranger.I got the rum, to be sure, and tried to put it down his throat, but his teeth were tightly shut and his jaws as strong as iron.It was a happy relief for us when the door opened and Doctor Livesey came in, on his visit to my father."
"“哦，医生，”我们叫道，“我们该怎么办？他伤到哪了？”","“Oh, doctor,” we cried, “what shall we do? Where is he wounded?”"
"“受伤？乱弹琴！”医生说。“没比你我多受任何伤。这个人是中风了，我曾经警告过他。现在，霍金斯太太，你跑到楼上你丈夫那里，如果可能的话，别告诉他任何关于这里的事。至于我，我一定尽力挽救这个家伙的毫无价值的生命。吉姆，给我拿个盆来。”","“Wounded? A fiddle-stick’s end!” said the doctor.“No more wounded than you or I.The man has had a stroke, as I warned him.Now, Mrs.Hawkins, just you run upstairs to your husband and tell him, if possible, nothing about it.For my part, I must do my best to save this fellow’s trebly worthless life; Jim, you get me a basin.”"
"当我拿着盆回来的时候，医生已经撕开船长的袖子，让他粗壮有力的胳膊露在外面。很多地方都刺了青。“鸿运高照”、“一路顺风”和“比利·博恩斯事事如愿”清晰整洁地纹在他的前臂上。上面接近肩膀的地方有一个人吊在绞刑架上的草图——完成这些刺青，我认为，需要极大的勇气。","When I got back with the basin, the doctor had already ripped up the captain’s sleeve and exposed his great sinewy arm.It was tattooed in several places.“Here’s luck,” “A fair wind,” and “Billy Bones his fancy,” were very neatly and clearly executed on the forearm; and up near the shoulder there was a sketch of a gallows and a man hanging from it—done, as I thought, with great spirit."
"“有先见之明。”医生说，同时用他的手摸着这些图案。“那么现在，比利·博恩斯先生，如果那是你的名字，我们就可以看看你的血是什么颜色了。吉姆，”他说，“你害怕血么？”","“Prophetic,” said the doctor, touching this picture with his finger.“And now, Master Billy Bones, if that be your name, we’ll have a look at the colour of your blood.Jim,” he said, “are you afraid of blood?”"
"“不怕，先生，”我说。","“No, sir,” said I."
"“那么，好的，”他说，“你拿着这个盆。”说着他拿起小刀，割开了一条静脉。","“Well, then,” said he, “you hold the basin”; and with that he took his lancet and opened a vein."
"放了许多血以后，船长睁开了眼睛，迷迷糊糊地望着四周。他先认出了医生，毫无疑问地皱着眉头，然后他的目光落在我身上，他看起来放松了一些。但是突然他的脸色变了，他努力想坐起来，并喊道：“黑狗在哪里？”“这里没有黑狗，”医生说，“只有你仰面朝天地躺在这里。你一直酗酒，已经中风了，如我曾经明确告诫过你的一样。我刚才已经违背了自己的意愿，抢先把你从坟墓里拉了出来。现在，博恩斯先生——”","A great deal of blood was taken before the captain opened his eyes and looked mistily about him.First he recognized the doctor with an unmistakable frown; then his glance fell upon me, and he looked relieved.But suddenly his colour changed, and he tried to raise himself, crying, “Where’s Black Dog?”“There is no Black Dog here,” said the doctor, “except what you have on your own back.You have been drinking rum; you have had a stroke, precisely as I told you; and I have just, very much against my own will, dragged you headforemost out of the grave. Now, Mr. Bones—”"
"“那不是我的名字。”他打断了医生的话。","“That’s not my name,” he interrupted."
"“我不在乎。”医生回答说。","“Much I care,” returned the doctor."
"“这是我认识的一个海盗的名字，我这样称呼你是为了简短起见。我不得不和你说的是，一杯酒不会害死你，但是如果你喝了一杯，然后又一杯接一杯地喝，我以我的假发打赌，如果你不赶快停止，你一定会死掉——你明白吗？——死掉，到你该去的地方，像《圣经》里的人一样。来，现在，用点力。","“It’s the name of a buccaneer of my acquaintance; and I call you by it for the sake of shortness, and what I have to say to you is this; one glass of rum won’t kill you, but if you take one you’ll take another and another, and I stake my wig if you don’t break off short, you’ll die—do you understand that?—die, and go to your own place, like the man in the Bible.Come, now, make an effort."
"我会扶你到床上，就这一次。”","I’ll help you to your bed for once.”"
"我们俩费了好大力气，设法把他抬上楼，把他放到床上。他的脑袋歪倒在枕头上，仿佛快晕倒了一样。","Between us, with much trouble, we managed to hoist him upstairs, and laid him on his bed, where his head fell back on the pillow as if he were almost fainting."
"“现在，我提醒你，”医生说，“我问心无愧——朗姆酒这个词对你来说就是死亡。”","“Now, mind you,” said the doctor, “I clear my conscience—the name of rum for you is death.”"
"说着，他拉着我的胳膊，离开去看我父亲了。","And with that he went off to see my father, taking me with him by the arm."
"“没关系，”他一关上门便说道，“我给他放了血，足以使他安静一会了。他应该会在那儿躺上一个星期——对他和你来说这是最好的事情，但是再来一次中风就会解决他了。”","“This is nothing,” he said as soon as he had closed the door.“I have drawn blood enough to keep him quiet awhile; he should lie for a week where he is—that is the best thing for him and you; but another stroke would settle him.”"
"第三章 黑劵","Chapter 3 The Black Spot "
"中午时分，我拿着一些清凉饮料和药品到船长门前。他还像我们离开时那样躺在那里，只是枕头垫得稍微高了点。他看上去既虚弱又兴奋。","About noon I stopped at the captain’s door with some cooling drinks and medicines.He was lying very much as we had left him, only a little higher, and he seemed both weak and excited."
"“吉姆，”他说，“你是这里唯一一个有用的人，你知道我一向对你很好。我每个月都给你一枚四便士的银币。现在你看，伙计，我身体很不好，被所有人遗弃。吉姆，现在给我拿一小杯朗姆酒好么，伙计？”","“Jim,” he said, “you’re the only one here that’s worth anything, and you know I’ve been always good to you.Never a month but I’ve given you a silver fourpenny for yourself.And now you see, mate, I’m pretty low, and deserted by all; and Jim, you’ll bring me one noggin of rum, now, won’t you, matey?”"
"“医生——”我开口说。","“The doctor—” I began."
"但是他打断我，诅咒起那个医生来，声音虚弱，但是发自内心。“医生都是笨蛋。”他说，“那个医生，凭什么，他对水手懂多少？我到过热得像沥青一样的地方，到过水手们得了黄热病一批批离去的地方，到过地面摇晃得像地震的海面的鬼地方——那个医生知道那种地方吗？——我以朗姆酒度日，我告诉你。对我来说，它是肉，是水，是朋友和老婆。如果我现在没有了朗姆酒，我就像条被风刮到下风岸的老破船，你们的身上会沾着我的血，吉姆你，还有那个笨蛋医生。”他又咒骂了一阵。“看，吉姆，我的手指抖得多厉害。”他用乞求的口气接着说。“我不能让他们保持静止，我不能。                                                                                                       在这个该死的日子里，我都没有沾一滴酒。那个医生就是个蠢货，我告诉你。如果我不喝上一口酒，吉姆，我就会出现幻觉，我已经看到一些人了。我看到老弗林特在角落里，就在你的身后，像印出来的一样清楚。如果我出现幻觉，我就会变得粗野，我会闹事。你们医生自己说过，一杯酒不会伤害到我。我会为一小杯酒给你一枚金几尼，吉姆。”","But he broke in cursing the doctor, in a feeble voice but heartily.“Doctors is all swabs,” he said; “and that doctor there, why, what do he know about seafaring men? I been in places hot as pitch, and mates dropping round with Yellow Jack, and the blessed land a—heaving like the sea with earthquakes—what to the doctor know of lands like that?—and I lived on rum, I tell you.It’s been meat and drink, and man and wife, to me; and if I’m not to have my rum now I’m a poor old hulk on a lee shore, my blood’ll be on you, Jim, and that doctor swab”; and he ran on again for a while with curses.“Look, Jim, how my fingers fidges,” he continued in the pleading tone.“I can’t keep ‘em still, not I.I haven’t had a drop this blessed day.That doctor’s a fool, I tell you.If I don’t have a drain o’ rum, Jim, I’ll have the horrors; I seen some on ‘em already.I seen old Flint in the corner there, behind you; as plain as print, I seen him; and if I get the horrors, I’m a man that has lived rough, and I’ll raise Cain.Your doctor himself said one glass wouldn’t hurt me.I’ll give you a golden guinea for a noggin, Jim.”"
"他变得越发兴奋，这使我警觉地想起我父亲来。他那天很虚弱，需要安静。而且，他引自医生的话打消了我的顾虑，不过他想给我贿赂倒令我有些恼怒。","He was growing more and more excited, and this alarmed me for my father, who was very low that day and needed quiet; besides, I was reassured by the doctor’s words, now quoted to me, and rather offended by the offer of a bribe."
"“我不想要你一分钱，”我说，“但是我要你欠我父亲的钱。我会给你一杯酒，但不会再多了。”","“I want none of your money,” said I, “but what you owe my father.I’ll get you one glass, and no more.”"
"当我把酒给他的时候，他贪婪地抓起酒杯，一饮而尽。","When I brought it to him, he seized it greedily and drank it out."
"“是啊，是啊，”他说，“这就好多了，千真万确。现在伙计，那个医生说过我要在这张老床上躺多久吗？”","“Aye, aye,” said he, “that’s some better, sure enough.And now, matey, did that doctor say how long I was to lie here in this old berth?”"
"“至少一个星期。”我说。","“A week at least,” said I."
"“天哪！”他叫道，“一个星期！我可办不到。他们那会儿就该给我黑券了。那些蠢货在这个该死的时候正在到处打听我的风声呢。他们保不住自己得到的东西，又想掠夺别人的。这是水手的作风吗？我现在倒真想知道。但我是个节俭的人。我从不乱花钱，也不会把钱弄丢，我会再逗他们一下的。我不怕他们。我要再次扬帆起航，伙计，我要再捉弄他们一把。”","“Thunder!” he cried.“A week! I can’t do that; they’d have the black spot on me by then.The lubbers is going about to get the wind of me this blessed moment; lubbers as couldn’t keep what they got, and want to nail what is another’s.Is that seamanly behaviour, now, I want to know?But I’m a saving soul.I never wasted good money of mine, nor lost it neither; and I’ll trick ‘em again.I’m not afraid on ‘em.I’ll shake out another reef, matey, and daddle ‘em again.”"
"他一边说着话，一边费了好大力气从床上起来。他一把抓住我的肩膀，差点让我哭出来，又挪动着他死沉死沉的腿。他的那些话，虽然意思上情绪饱满，却与他声音的虚弱形成了可悲的对比。他在床边坐起来后，停了一下。“那个医生把我害苦了。”他低声抱怨着，“我的耳朵在响。让我躺回去。”","As he was thus speaking, he had risen from bed with great difficulty, holding to my shoulder with a grip that almost made me cry out, and moving his legs like so much dead weight.His words, spirited as they were in meaning, contrasted sadly with the weakness of the voice in which they were uttered.He paused when he had got into a sitting position on the edge.“That doctor’s done me,” he murmured.“My ears is singing.Lay me back.”"
"我还没怎么来得及帮他，他就又倒回了原来躺着的地方，半天都没说话。","Before I could do much to help him he had fallen back again to his former place, where he lay for a while silent."
"“吉姆，”他最后说道，“你今天看到那个水手了吗？”","“Jim,” he said at length, “you saw that seafaring man today?”"
"“黑狗吗？”我问。","“Black Dog?” I asked."
"“啊！黑狗。”他说道，“他是个坏蛋，但是派他来的人更坏。现在，如果我不能离开、而他们给我下黑券的话，你注意，他们想要的是我航海用的旧箱子，你就骑上一匹马——你可以的，不是吗？那么，你骑上马，去——是的，我决定！","“Ah!Black Dog,” said he.“He’s a bad un; but there’s worse that put him on.Now, if I can’t get away nohow, and they tip me the black spot, mind you, it’s my old sea-chest they’re after; you get on a horse—you can, can’t you?Well, then, you get on a horse, and go to—well, yes, I will!"
"——去那个该死的医生那里，让他召集所有的人——地方官之类的——他会在‘本博将军’这里把他们一网打尽——所有老弗林特的下属，老的少的，所有剩下的人。我曾是个大副，我曾是，老弗林特船上的大副，我是唯一知道那个地方的人。他在萨凡纳把它给了我，那时候他快要——死了，就像我现在一样，你看。但是，除非他们给我下了黑券，或者除非你看见那个黑狗又来了，或者一个独腿水手——吉姆，尤其是他，你再去报告。”","—to that eternal doctor swab, and tell him to pipe all hands—magistrates and sich—and he’ll lay ‘em aboard at the Admiral Benbow—all old Flint’s crew, man and boy, all on ‘em that’s left.I was first mate, I was, old Flint’s first mate, and I’m the on’y one as knows the place.He gave it me at Savannah, when he lay a—dying, like as if I was to now, you see.But you won’t peach unless they get the black spot on me, or unless you see that Black Dog again or a seafaring man with one leg, Jim—him above all.”"
"“但是，什么是黑券呢，船长？”我问。","“But what is the black spot, captain?” I asked."
"“那是一种传唤令，伙计。如果他们送来了，我会告诉你的。但是你要留神——睁大眼睛，吉姆，我会和你平分所得，以我的名誉保证。”","“That’s a summons, mate.I’ll tell you if they get that.But you keep your weather-eye open, Jim, and I’ll share with you equals, upon my honour.”"
"他又胡思乱想了一小会儿，声音变得更加虚弱。但是就在我给他拿了药之后，他一边像个孩子似的吃着药，一边说：“如果有一个水手想要吃药，那就是我。”最后，他昏昏沉沉地倒下——像睡着了一样，我就离开他了。我不知道，如果一切顺利的话，我该怎么做。很有可能我会把一切告诉那个医生，因为我害怕极了，担心船长后悔自己的坦白而把我干掉。但事情越发糟糕，我可怜的父亲那天晚上突然去世了，让所有其他的事情都搁置了下来。我们自然而生的悲痛，邻里的拜访，葬礼的安排，以及旅店所有事情的料理接踵而至，让我忙得无暇顾及船长，更不用说怕他了。","He wandered a little longer, his voice growing weaker; but soon after I had given him his medicine, which he took like a child, with the remark, “If ever a seaman wanted drugs, it’s me,” he fell at last into a heavy, swoon—like sleep, in which I left him.What I should have done had all gone well I do not know.Probably I should have told the whole story to the doctor, for I was in mortal fear lest the captain should repent of his confessions and make an end of me.But as things fell out, my poor father died quite suddenly that evening, which put all other matters on one side.Our natural distress, the visits of the neighbours, the arranging of the funeral, and all the work of the inn to be carried on in the meanwhile kept me so busy that I had scarcely time to think of the captain, far less to be afraid of him."
"第二天他下楼来，确实，像往常一样用餐，尽管他吃得很少，但我估计他喝了比往常还要多的朗姆酒。他自己从酒吧间里把酒拿出来，满脸怒气，还哼着鼻子，没人敢从他面前经过。葬礼的前一天晚上，他和往常一样醉醺醺的。在这间充满哀悼的屋子里听到他唱起那首难听的老船歌，真是令人震惊。但是他又是那么虚弱，我们都担心他会死掉。医生也突然到几英里外的地方看诊去了，自我父亲去世后，他就再也不在我家附近了。我说过船长很虚弱，而且他看起来的确越来越衰弱，而不是恢复他的力气。他在楼梯上爬上爬下的，从大厅走到酒吧，然后再回到大厅。有时他会把鼻子伸出门外闻一闻海的味道。他用手扶着墙支撑着走路，呼吸沉重而急促得像一个在爬陡坡的人。他再没特意和我说过话，我相信他完全忘了他的秘密。但是他的脾气越来越糟，而且随着他身体的日渐衰弱，他的脾气变得比以往更加粗暴。现在，他有一种警戒方式。当他喝酒时，他就把自己的短刀拔出来，赤裸裸地放在他面前的桌子上。但是做这些的同时，他对别人也更不在意了。他似乎把自己关在了自己的想法里，更加神志恍惚。比如有一次，极其出乎我们的意料，他哼出了一首不同的调子，一首乡村情歌。这一定是在他还年轻、尚未出海之前学会的。","He got downstairs next morning, to be sure, and had his meals as usual, though he ate little and had more, I am afraid, than his usual supply of rum, for he helped himself out of the bar, scowling and blowing through his nose, and no one dared to cross him.On the night before the funeral he was as drunk as ever; and it was shocking, in that house of mourning, to hear him singing away at his ugly old sea-song; but weak as he was, we were all in the fear of death for him, and the doctor was suddenly taken up with a case many miles away and was never near the house after my father’s death.I have said the captain was weak, and indeed he seemed rather to grow weaker than regain his strength.He clambered up and down stairs, and went from the parlour to the bar and back again, and sometimes put his nose out of doors to smell the sea, holding on to the walls as he went for support and breathing hard and fast like a man on a steep mountain.He never particularly addressed me, and it is my belief he had as good as forgotten his confidences; but his temper was more flighty, and allowing for his bodily weakness, more violent than ever.He had an alarming way now when he was drunk of drawing his cutlass and laying it bare before him on the table.But with all that, he minded people less and seemed shut up in his own thoughts and rather wandering.Once, for instance, to our extreme wonder, he piped up to a different air, a king of country love—song that he must have learned in his youth before he had begun to follow the sea."
"事情一直这样持续着，直到葬礼后第二天下午大约三点钟。那是一个寒冷而霜雾蒙蒙的下午，我站在门口呆了一会儿，满怀对父亲的哀思。这时，我看到有人慢慢沿着大路朝这边走近。他显然是个瞎子，因为他用棍子敲着前面的路，而且眼睛和鼻子上戴着一个大绿罩子。他弯着身子，似乎年岁很大或者身体虚弱。他还带了一个有风帽的巨大的旧航海斗篷，使他显得非常怪异。我这辈子从没见过比这更可怕的样子。他在离旅店不远的地方停下来，抬高嗓门用一种古怪的唱歌调子对着他面前的空气说起话来，“哪位好心的朋友能告诉一位可怜的瞎子，他在高尚的保卫祖国英格兰的反抗中失去了宝贵的视力——上帝保佑乔治王！——他现在在哪里，或者在祖国的哪个地方？”","So things passed until, the day after the funeral, and about three o’clock of a bitter, foggy, frosty afternoon, I was standing at the door for a moment, full of sad thoughts about my father, when I saw someone drawing slowly near along the road.He was plainly blind, for he tapped before him with a stick and wore a great green shade over his eyes and nose; and he was hunched, as if with age or weakness, and wore a huge old tattered sea-cloak with a hood that made him appear positively deformed.I never saw in my life a more dreadful-looking figure.He stopped a little from the inn, and raising his voice in an odd sing-song, addressed the air in front of him, “will any kind friend inform a poor blind man, who has lost the precious sight of his eyes in the gracious defence of his native country, England—and God bless King George!—where or in what part of this country he may now be?”"
"“您在‘本博将军’旅店，在黑山湾，我的好人。”我说。","“You are at the Admiral Benbow, Black Hill Cove, my good man,” said I."
"“我听到一个声音，”他说，“一个年轻的声音。我好心的年轻朋友，你愿意把你的手给我，领我进去吗？”","“I hear a voice,” said he, “a young voice.Will you give me your hand, my kind young friend, and lead me in?”"
"我伸出手，那个可怕的、口气软绵绵的瞎眼家伙像把虎钳一样立刻抓住了它。我吓了一大跳，挣扎着想把手缩回去，但是那个瞎子胳膊一用力一把我拉到他的身边。","I held out my hand, and the horrible, soft-spoken, eyeless creature gripped it in a moment like a vise.I was so much startled that I struggled to withdraw, but the blind man pulled me close up to him with a single action of his arm."
"“现在，小男孩，”他说，“带我去见船长。”","“Now, boy,” he said, “take me in to the captain.”"
"“先生，”我说，“我发誓我不敢。”","“Sir,” said I, “upon my word I dare not.”"
"“哦，”他冷笑了一下，“原来如此！直接带我进去，否则我就弄断你的胳膊。”","“Oh,” he sneered, “that’s it!Take me in straight or I’ll break your arm.”"
"说着他就拧了一下，这一拧差点让我叫出来。","And he gave it, as he spoke, a wrench that made me cry out."
"“先生，”我说，“我是为您着想。船长不是从前那个样子了。他拿着一把短刀坐着。另外一位先生——”","“Sir,” said I, “it is for yourself I mean.The captain is not what he used to be.He sits with a drawn cutlass.Another gentleman—”"
"“好了，现在走吧。”他打断了我的话。我从来没听过像这个瞎子那样如此残忍、冷酷而又难听的声音。这比刚才的疼痛更让我恐惧，我立刻开始听他的话，从门口直向大厅走去。我们虚弱的老海盗就坐在那里喝得烂醉。那个瞎子用一个铁拳紧紧抓着我，而且几乎把他全部的重量都倾到我的身上，超出了我能承受的重量。“带我直接到他那儿，我到他视野里的时候，你就喊‘这是你的一位朋友，比尔。’如果你不喊，我就会这样。”说着他扯了我一下，我觉得自己差点晕过去。两者比较一下，我完全被这个瞎乞丐吓坏了，而忘了对船长的恐惧。当我打开大厅门时，我用颤抖的声音喊出了刚才瞎子命令我说的话。","“Come, now, march,” interrupted he; and I never heard a voice so cruel, and cold, and ugly as that blind man’s.It cowed me more than the pain, and I began to obey him at once, walking straight in at the door and towards the parlour, where our sick old buccaneer was sitting, dazed with rum.The blind man clung close to me, holding me in one iron fist and leaning almost more of his weight on me than I could carry.“Lead me straight up to him, and when I’m in view, cry out, ‘Here’s a friend for you, Bill.’ If you don’t, I’ll do this,” and with that he gave me a twitch that I thought would have made me faint.Between this and that, I was so utterly terrified of the blind beggar that I forgot my terror of the captain, and as I opened the parlour door, cried out the words he had ordered in a trembling voice."
"可怜的船长抬起眼睛，只瞥了一眼，朗姆酒就烟消云散了，他清醒地瞪着。他脸上的表情与其说是恐怖，不如说是垂死的病态。他动了一下想站起来，但是我不相信他身体里还有足够的力量。","The poor captain raised his eyes, and at one look the rum went out of him and left him staring sober.The expression of his face was not so much of terror as of mortal sickness.He made a movement to rise, but I do not believe he had enough force left in his body."
"“现在，比尔，坐在原地。”乞丐说道。“就算我不能看，我也能听到一根手指颤动的声音。公事公办。伸出你的左手。孩子，握住他的左手腕，把它拿到我的右边来。”","“Now, Bill, sit where you are,” said the beggar.“If I can’t see, I can hear a finger stirring.Business is business.Hold out your left hand.Boy, take his left hand by the wrist and bring it near to my right.”"
"我们都照着他的话办了，我看到他从握手杖的手心里拿出个东西放到了船长的手掌上，船长立刻合上了手掌。","We both obeyed him to the letter, and I saw him pass something from the hollow of the hand that held his stick into the palm of the captain’s, which closed upon it instantly."
"“现在结束了。”瞎子说。然后，他突然放开我，以难以置信的精确和敏捷蹿出了大厅，到路上去了。我还呆呆地站在那里，能听到他的棍子笃笃笃地敲着路面的声音，越来越远。","“And now that’s done,” said the blind man; and at the words he suddenly left hold of me, and with incredible accuracy and nimbleness, skipped out of the parlour and into the road, where, as I still stood motionless, I could hear his stick go tap-tap—tapping into the distance."
"我和船长都过了很大一会儿才恢复了神志，但是最终，几乎是同时，我松开了仍握着的船长的手腕；他则把手收回去，飞快地看了一眼手掌。","It was some time before either I or the captain seemed to gather our senses, but at length, and about at the same moment, I released his wrist, which I was still holding, and he drew in his hand and looked sharply into the palm."
"“十点钟！”他喊道。“六个小时。我们还可以捉弄他们。”他跳了起来。但他刚这么做，他就晃了一下，一只手放在喉咙上，摇摇晃晃地站了一会儿。然后他发出一种奇怪的声音，整个身体向脸朝下倒在了地板上。","“Ten o’clock!” he cried.“Six hours.We’ll do them yet,” and he sprang to his feet.Even as he did so, he reeled, put his hand to his throat, stood swaying for a moment, and then, with a peculiar sound, fell from his whole height face foremost to the floor."
"我立刻跑向他，喊着母亲。但是再快也都是徒劳。船长已经因为中风死了，异乎寻常的中风。这是件不好理解的怪事，因为尽管我最近才开始同情他，我肯定从来没喜欢过这个人。但是一看到他死了，我却也泪如泉涌起来。这是我知道的第二个起死亡，而那时我心中对第一起死亡的哀恸仍然鲜明。","I ran to him at once, calling to my mother.But haste was all in vain.The captain had been struck dead by thundering apoplexy.It is a curious thing to understand, for I had certainly never liked the man, though of late I had begun to pity him, but as soon as I saw that he was dead, I burst into a flood of tears.It was the second death I had known, and the sorrow of the first was still fresh in my heart."
"第四章 航海用的大箱子","Chapter 4  The Sea-chest "
"当然，我立刻将我知道的一切告诉了母亲，也许我早该告诉她这些的，然后我们立刻意识到，自己处在困难而危险的境地。那个人的一些钱——如果他有的话——当然属于我们，但是我们船长的船友们，特别是我见到的那两个怪人——黑狗和瞎乞丐——则不太可能会愿意放弃他们的战利品，作为船长债务的抵偿。至于船长要我立刻骑马去找利夫西医生的命令会使我的母亲独自留下，毫无保护，这是我没有想到的。实际上，让我们两个中的任何一个在这房子里呆上更长的时间，似乎都是不可能的。厨房炉子里煤块烧得掉下来的声音，甚至是时钟的滴答声，都让我们心惊胆战。我们的耳朵感到周围似乎萦绕着越来越近的脚步声。而且一想到船长的尸体就在客厅的地板上，想到可恶的瞎乞丐就在附近徘徊，随时可能回来，我有好几次都吓得，就像谚语中说的那样，毛骨悚然。有些事必须快速做出决断，于是我们最终决定一起去附近的村子求援。说干就干。我们光着脑袋、顶着渐浓的夜色和凄冷的大雾跑了出去。","I lost no time, of course, in telling my mother all that I knew, and perhaps should have told her long before, and we saw ourselves at once in a difficult and dangerous position.Some of the man’s money—if he had any—was certainly due to us, but it was not likely that our captain’s shipmates, above all the two specimens seen by me, Black Dog and the blind beggar, would be inclined to give up their booty in payment of the dead man’s debts.The captain’s order to mount at once and ride for Doctor Livesey would have left my mother alone and unprotected, which was not to be thought of.Indeed, it seemed impossible for either of us to remain much longer in the house; the fall of coals in the kitchen grate, the very ticking of the clock, filled us with alarms.The neighbourhood, to our ears, seemed haunted by approaching footsteps; and what between the dead body of the captain on the parlour floor and the thought of that detestable blind beggar hovering near at hand and ready to return, there were moments when, as the saying goes, I jumped in my skin for terror.Something must speedily be resolved upon, and it occurred to us at last to go forth together and seek help in the neighbouring hamlet.No sooner said than done.Bare-headed as we were, we ran out at once in the gathering evening and the frosty fog."
"村子只在几百码开外，下一个海湾的另一头，尽管在我们的视野之外。而且令我勇气大增的是，村子的方向和瞎子出现并可能返回的方向正好相反。我们在路上没花多久，虽然我们有时候停下来互相搀扶，侧耳倾听。但是并没有什么异常的声音——只有海浪拍岸的起伏声和林中鸟儿的啼叫声。","The hamlet lay not many hundred yards away, though out of view, on the other side of the next cove; and what greatly encouraged me, it was in an opposite direction from that whence the blind man had made his appearance and whither he had presumably returned.We were not many minutes on the road, though we sometimes stopped to lay hold of each other and hearken.But there was no unusual sound—nothing but the low wash of the ripple and the croaking of the inmates of the wood."
"我们到达村子的时候，已是点烛时分，我永远忘不了透过门窗看到黄色光亮时自己是多么高兴。但是那灯光，就像后来被证实的那样，已经是我们在这里能得到的最大的帮助了。因为——你也许会认为村里人会为自己感到惭愧——没有人愿意陪我们回“本博将军”旅店。我们越说我们的困难，他们——男人、女人、小孩——就越死守在自己的屋里。尽管弗林特船长这个名字对我来说很陌生，这里的一些人却对它耳熟能详，给他们带来极大的恐慌。在野外劳动中到过“本博将军”旅店那边的一些人记起来，他们曾经在路上见过几个陌生人，以为是走私客，大家就逃跑了。至少一个人还在我们叫基特湾的地方见过一条小帆船。因为这个，任何弗林特船长的伙伴都足以把他们吓死。总之，事情的结果就是，有些人愿意骑马往另一个方向去找利夫西医生，但没有人愿意帮我们保卫旅店。","It was already candle-light when we reached the hamlet, and I shall never forget how much I was cheered to see the yellow shine in doors and windows; but that, as it proved, was the best of the help we were likely to get in that quarter.For—you would have thought men would have been ashamed of themselves—no soul would consent to return with us to the Admiral Benbow.The more we told of our troubles, the more—man, woman, and child—they clung to the shelter of their houses.The name of Captain Flint, though it was strange to me, was well enough known to some there and carried a great weight of terror.Some of the men who had been to field-work on the far side of the Admiral Benbow remembered, besides, to have seen several strangers on the road, and taking them to be smugglers, to have bolted away; and one at least had seen a little lugger in what we called Kitt’s Hole.For that matter, anyone who was a comrade of the captain’s was enough to frighten them to death.And the short and the long of the matter was, that while we could get several who were willing enough to ride to Dr.Livesey’s, which lay in another direction, not one would help us to defend the inn."
"他们说怯懦是会传染的。但是另一方面，争论又可以鼓舞人心。所以当每个人都谈了自己的想法后，我的母亲也对他们说了一番话。她声明她不会让属于她的这个丧父小男孩的钱白白丢掉。“如果你们剩下的人没有一个人敢去的话，”她说，“吉姆和我敢去。我们会顺着我们来的路回去，对你们这些体壮如牛却胆小如鼠的人，我们只有极少的一丝谢意。我们会打开那个箱子，即使丢了性命。我要感谢你们的那个袋子，克罗斯利太太，它可以装我们应得的钱。”","They say cowardice is infectious; but then argument is, on the other hand, a great emboldener; and so when each had said his say, my mother made them a speech.She would not, she declared, lose money that belonged to her fatherless boy; “If none of the rest of you dare,”  she said, “ Jim and I dare.Back we will go, the way we came, and small thanks to you big, hulking, chicken-hearted men.We’ll have that chest open, if we die for it.And I’ll thank you for that bag, Mrs. Crossley, to bring back our lawful money in.”"
"我当然说我愿意和母亲一起走，他们也自然为我们的鲁莽叫喊起来，但是即使这样，也没有一个人愿意和我们一起走。他们愿意做的一切就是给我一把装好了子弹的手枪，以防我们遭到袭击。他们还承诺备好马安好鞍，以防我们在返回时被追赶。同时他们会派一个年轻人骑马到医生那里寻找武装援助。","Of course I said I would go with my mother, and of course they all cried out at our foolhardiness, but even then not a man would go along with us.All they would do was to give me a loaded pistol lest we were attacked, and to promise to have horses ready saddled in case we were pursued on our return, while one lad was to ride forward to the doctor’s in search of armed assistance."
"当我们两个在这寒夜踏上这危险的旅程时，我的心猛烈地跳着。一轮满月开始升起，带着红晕透过雾气的上边，这促使我们加快了脚步，因为很明显，当我们再返回时，一切都将如白昼般明亮，我们一出发就会暴露在任何监视者的眼中。我们悄悄地快速溜过篱笆，也没有看或听任何会增加我们恐惧的东西，直到“本博将军”旅店的大门在我们身后关上的时候，我们才松了口气。","My heart was beating finely when we two set forth in the cold night upon this dangerous venture.A full moon was beginning to rise and peered redly through the upper edges of the fog, and this increased our haste, for it was plain, before we came forth again, that all would be as bright as day, and our departure exposed to the eyes of any watchers.We slipped along the hedges, noiseless and swift, nor did we see or hear anything to increase our terrors, till, to our relief, the door of the Admiral Benbow had closed behind us."
"我立刻插上了门闩。我们在黑暗中站了一会儿，气喘吁吁。房子里只有船长的尸体。然后母亲从酒吧间里拿了根蜡烛，我们手拉着手走进了大厅。他还像我们离开他时一样仰面躺着，睁着眼睛，伸着一只胳膊。","I slipped the bolt at once, and we stood and panted for a moment in the dark, alone in the house with the dead captain’s body.Then my mother got a candle in the bar, and holding each other’s hands, we advanced into the parlour.He lay as we had left him, on his back, with his eyes open and one arm stretched out."
"“拉下窗帘，吉姆。”母亲小声说，“他们也许会来，在外面监视我们呢。现在，”我拉下窗帘时，她说，“我们必须把钥匙从那上取下来，可谁去碰它呢，我真想知道！”她抽泣着说了这些话。","“Draw down the blind, Jim,” whispered my mother; “they might come and watch outside.And now,” said she when I had done so, “we have to get the key off THAT; and who’s to touch it, I should like to know!” and she gave a kind of sob as she said the words."
"我立刻跪了下去。一个小圆纸片在靠近船长手的地板上，有一面被漆成了黑色。我认定这就是“黑券”。我把它拿起来，发现另一面写着字，写得既漂亮又清楚，有短短一句话：“限你到今晚十点。”","I went down on my knees at once.On the floor close to his hand there was a little round of paper, blackened on the one side.I could not doubt that this was the BLACK SPOT; and taking it up, I found written on the other side, in a very good, clear hand, this short message: “You have till ten tonight.”"
"“限他到十点，妈妈。”我说。就在我说这话的时候，我们的老钟表开始敲起来。这突如其来的响声把我们吓了一大跳，但是消息是好的，因为才刚刚六点。","“He had till ten, Mother,” said I; and just as I said it, our old clock began striking.This sudden noise startled us shockingly; but the news was good, for it was only six."
"“现在，吉姆，”她说，“那把钥匙。”","“Now, Jim,” she said, “that key.”"
"我摸进他的口袋，一个一个地找。几个小硬币，一个顶针，还有一些线和大根的针，一根咬掉了一端的辫状卷烟，他的弯柄折刀，一个袖珍指南针，还有一个火绒箱，这就是里面装的所有东西了，我开始失望起来。","I felt in his pockets, one after another.A few small coins, a thimble, and some thread and big needles, a piece of pigtail tobacco bitten away at the end, his gully with the crooked handle, a pocket compass, and a tinder box were all that they contained, and I began to despair."
"“也许挂在他脖子上。”母亲提醒我。","“Perhaps it’s round his neck,” suggested my mother."
"我忍着强烈的厌恶感撕开他的衬衣领子，那里真的挂着一根涂了柏油的绳子。我用他的折刀割断绳子，我们找到了钥匙。这小小的胜利使我们充满了希望，于是我们赶紧跑上楼，毫不迟疑地去了那间他睡了很久的屋子。他的箱子从他来那天起就立在那里。","Overcoming a strong repugnance, I tore open his shirt at the neck, and there, sure enough, hanging to a bit of tarry string, which I cut with his own gully, we found the key.At this triumph we were filled with hope and hurried upstairs without delay to the little room where he had slept so long and where his box had stood since the day of his arrival."
"它的外表看上去和任何其他的水手箱子一模一样，一个首字母“B”被烙铁烫在顶部。由于使用多年，而且不加爱护，箱子角都有些破损了。","It was like any other seaman’s chest on the outside, the initial “B” burned on the top of it with a hot iron, and the corners somewhat smashed and broken as by long, rough usage."
"“给我钥匙。”母亲说。尽管锁很紧，她转动钥匙，一眨眼就把盖子打开了。","“Give me the key,” said my mother; and though the lock was very stiff, she had turned it and thrown back the lid in a twinkling."
"一股浓烈的烟草和柏油味立刻从箱子里扑鼻而来，但是顶部除了一套很好的衣服，就什么也看不到了。那套衣服被刷得干干净净，叠得整整齐齐。母亲说它们从来都没被穿过。那套衣服下面，杂物开始出现——一个四分仪，一个锡制酒杯，几根烟草，两把很帅气的手枪，一根银条，一块旧西班牙手表，还有一些其他不值钱的小饰物，大多是国外造的，还有一对黄铜做的罗盘和五六个稀罕的西印度贝壳。我常常想，他为什么带这些贝壳在身边，过他那四处漂泊、被追得东逃西窜的罪恶时日。","A strong smell of tobacco and tar rose from the interior, but nothing was to be seen on the top except a suit of very good clothes, carefully brushed and folded.They had never been worn, my mother said.Under that, the miscellany began—a quadrant, a tin canikin, several sticks of tobacco, two brace of very handsome pistols, a piece of bar silver, an old Spanish watch and some other trinkets of little value and mostly of foreign make, a pair of compasses mounted with brass, and five or six curious West Indian shells.I have often wondered since why he should have carried about these shells with him in his wandering, guilty, and hunted life."
"同时，除了那根银条和那些小饰物，我们没有找到任何值钱的东西，没有一样是我们要的。再往下面，是一件旧的航海斗篷，在许多海港被海盐冲刷得都泛白了。母亲不耐烦地把斗篷往上一拎，于是箱子里最后的东西就呈现在我们眼前了。那是用油布捆着的一包东西，看起来像是文件；还有一个帆布袋，一碰便发出金属撞击的叮叮当当的声音。","In the meantime, we had found nothing of any value but the silver and the trinkets, and neither of these were in our way.Underneath there was an old boat-cloak, whitened with sea-salt on many a harbour-bar.My mother pulled it up with impatience, and there lay before us, the last things in the chest, a bundle tied up in oilcloth, and looking like papers, and a canvas bag that gave forth, at a touch, the jingle of gold."
"“我要让那些恶棍知道，我是个诚实的女人。”母亲说，“我要拿回属于我的钱，一个子儿也不差。拿着克罗斯利太太的袋子。”","“I’ll show these rogues that I’m an honest woman,” said my mother.“I’ll have my dues, and not a farthing over.Hold Mrs. Crossley’s bag.”"
"于是她一面开始算计船长欠我们多少钱，一面从水手袋子里拿出钱来放进我拿着的那个袋子里。","And she began to count over the amount of the captain’s score from the sailor’s bag into the one that I was holding."
"这是件费时的麻烦事，因为那些硬币来自各个国家，而且大小不同，有西班牙的都布隆金币，法国的金路易，英国的几尼，以及面值八块的硬币，还有我根本不认识的，全都混杂在一块儿。几尼大概是最少的，也是这些硬币里母亲唯一知道怎么算钱的。","It was a long, difficult business, for the coins were of all countries and sizes-doubloons, and louis d’ors, and guineas, and pieces of eight, and I know not what besides, all shaken together at random.The guineas, too, were about the scarcest, and it was with these only that my mother knew how to make her count."
"我们数了大概一半的时候，我突然把手放在母亲的胳膊上，因为我在这寂静而寒冷的空气中听到了一个声音，让我的心都跳到了嗓子眼儿——笃笃笃的敲击声——瞎子的棍子敲在结冰的路面上的声音。声音越来越近，我们坐下，屏住呼吸。接着，它重重地敲打着旅店的门，我们听到门把手转动的声音，还有门闩发出的咔嗒声，那个恶棍想要进来。接着屋子内外便是长时间的宁静。最后，敲门声又响起来了，让我们无比高兴的是，那声音又渐渐远去，然后完全消失，再也听不见了。","When we were about half-way through, I suddenly put my hand upon her arm, for I had heard in the silent frosty air a sound that brought my heart into my mouth—the tap—tapping of the blind man’s stick upon the frozen road.It drew nearer and nearer, while we sat holding our breath.Then it struck sharp on the inn door, and then we could hear the handle being turned and the bolt rattling as the wretched being tried to enter; and then there was a long time of silence both within and without.At last the tapping recommenced, and, to our indescribable joy and gratitude, died slowly away again until it ceased to be heard."
"“妈妈，”我说，“都拿走，然后咱们走吧。”因为我可以肯定，插着门闩的店门一定会引起怀疑，会把那窝黄蜂都招到我们耳边来。虽然谢天谢地我把门插上了，从没见过那可怕的瞎子的人是不会知道这感觉的。","“Mother,” said I, “take the whole and let’s be going,” for I was sure the bolted door must have seemed suspicious and would bring the whole hornet’s nest about our ears, though how thankful I was that I had bolted it, none could tell who had never met that terrible blind man."
"但是我母亲，尽管她也吓坏了，却不同意多拿走一分她不该得到的钱，而且她还固执地不愿少拿一分钱。还不到七点钟，她说，还有很久呢。她知道她的权利，而且她会拥有它们的。她仍然在和我争论，突然一个低低的哨声从山上传过来。这就足够了，太足够了，对我们俩来说。","But my mother, frightened as she was, would not consent to take a fraction more than was due to her and was obstinately unwilling to be content with less.It was not yet seven, she said, by a long way; she knew her rights and she would have them; and she was still arguing with me when a little low whistle sounded a good way off upon the hill.That was enough, and more than enough, for both of us."
"“我要拿走我该得的钱。”她说着便跳了起来。","“I’ll take what I have,” she said, jumping to her feet."
"“而且我要拿这个来清账。”我边说边拿起那个油布包。","“And I’ll take this to square the count,”said I, picking up the oilskin packet."
"接着我们俩把蜡烛留在空箱子旁，摸索着下楼去了。再然后，我们打开门，全速撤离。我们出发得正是时候。雾正迅速地散开。月亮早把两边的高地照得透亮。只有山谷的正底部和店门四周还有一层薄雾未褪去，可以掩护我们刚开始的逃跑。还没走到村子一半的路，就在山底再往上一点，我们就必须走在月光下了。不止这些，几个人奔跑的脚步声已经传入我们耳中，我们朝他们的方向望去，看到一束灯光正前后摇晃着向我们迅速逼近，这表明来人当中有一个人提着灯。","Next moment we were both groping downstairs, leaving the candle by the empty chest; and the next we had opened the door and were in full retreat.We had not started a moment too soon.The fog was rapidly dispersing; already the moon shone quite clear on the high ground on either side; and it was only in the exact bottom of the dell and round the tavern door that a thin veil still hung unbroken to conceal the first steps of our escape.Far less than half-way to the hamlet, very little beyond the bottom of the hill, we must come forth into the moonlight.Nor was this all, for the sound of several footsteps running came already to our ears, and as we looked back in their direction, a light tossing to and fro and still rapidly advancing showed that one of the newcomers carried a lantern."
"“我的天，”母亲突然说，“带上钱接着跑吧。我快晕了。”","“My dear,” said my mother suddenly, “take the money and run on.I am going to faint.”"
"我想，这下我们肯定完了。我如何能不诅咒村民们的懦弱，如何能不责怪我可怜的母亲的诚实和贪婪、以及她刚才的愚勇和现在的软弱！幸好我们到了小桥。我扶着跌跌撞撞的母亲到了岸边，在那儿，说真的，她叹了口气，倒在我的肩上。我完全不知道是哪儿找来的力气，虽然我恐怕动作很粗鲁，但还是设法把她拉下了河岸，向拱桥下面走了几步。再往前我就拉不动她了，因为桥太低，只能让我爬到它下面去。于是我们就呆在那里——母亲几乎完全暴露在外，我们俩都还在旅店能听到范围内。","This was certainly the end for both of us, I thought.How I cursed the cowardice of the neighbours; how I blamed my poor mother for her honesty and her greed, for her past foolhardiness and present weakness!We were just at the little bridge, by good fortune; and I helped her, tottering as she was, to the edge of the bank, where, sure enough, she gave a sigh and fell on my shoulder.I do not know how I found the strength to do it at all, and I am afraid it was roughly done, but I managed to drag her down the bank and a little way under the arch.Farther I could not move her, for the bridge was too low to let me do more than crawl below it.So there we had to stay—my mother almost entirely exposed and both of us within earshot of the inn."
"第五章 瞎子的下场","Chapter 5 The Last of the Blind Man  "
"我的好奇心在某种意义上战胜了我的恐惧。因为我不能呆在原地，只能再爬回岸上，把脑袋躲到一丛金雀花后面。在那里我可以俯视着我们家门前的大路。我刚躲好地方，敌人就开始出现了。他们有七八个人，脚步参差不齐地沿着大路气喘吁吁跑过来，提着灯的家伙比其他人快几步。三个人在一起跑，还手拉着手。即使透过雾气，我还是看清这三个人中间的那个就是瞎乞丐。紧接着，他说话的声音告诉我，我猜对了。","My curiosity, in a sense, was stronger than my fear, for I could not remain where I was, but crept back to the bank again, whence, sheltering my head behind a bush of broom, I might command the road before our door.I was scarcely in position ere my enemies began to arrive, seven or eight of them, running hard, their feet beating out of time along the road and the man with the lantern some paces in front.Three men ran together, hand in hand; and I made out, even through the mist, that the middle man of this trio was the blind beggar.The next moment his voice showed me that I was right."
"“把门砸开！”他叫道。","“Down with the door!” he cried."
"“是，是，先生！”两三个人回应道。他们冲向“本博将军”旅店，提灯的家伙在后面跟着。然后我看到他们停住了，听到他们在小声说着话，似乎对大敞的店门感到惊讶。但停止是短暂的，因为瞎子又发出了命令。他的声音听起来更高更响，好像他已经怒火中烧、迫不及待了。","“Aye, aye, sir!”Answered two or three; and a rush was made upon the Admiral Benbow, the lantern-bearer following; and then I could see them pause, and hear speeches passed in a lower key, as if they were surprised to find the door open.But the pause was brief, for the blind man again issued his commands.His voice sounded louder and higher, as if he were afire with eagerness and rage."
"“进，进，进！”他叫着，咒骂他们太拖沓。","“In, in, in!” he shouted, and cursed them for their delay."
"他们当中四五个人立刻听了他的话，剩下两个人则和可恶的瞎子留在大路上。有一个暂停，接着便是一声惊呼，再然后一个声音从屋里传来：“比尔死了。”","Four or five of them obeyed at once, two remaining on the road with the formidable beggar.There was a pause, then a cry of surprise, and then a voice shouting from the house, “Bill’s dead.”"
"但是瞎子还是在咒骂他们的拖沓。","But the blind man swore at them again for their delay."
"“你们这些开小差的笨蛋，搜他的身，其余人上楼去拿箱子。”他叫道。","“Search him, some of you shirking lubbers, and the rest of you aloft and get the chest,” he cried."
"我听到他们跑上楼，脚步咚咚咚地，屋子都跟着晃动了。不一会儿，屋子里又发出了惊叫声，船长房间的窗户被人猛地推开了，碎玻璃叮叮当当地响。一个人把脑袋和肩膀都斜着伸到外面的月光下，对着下面路上的瞎子乞丐说话。","I could hear their feet rattling up our old stairs, so that the house must have shook with it.Promptly afterwards, fresh sounds of astonishment arose; the window of the captain’s room was thrown open with a slam and a jingle of broken glass, and a man leaned out into the moonlight, head and shoulders, and addressed the blind beggar on the road below him."
"“皮尤，”他叫道，“有人在我们之前来过了。有人已经打开过箱子，翻了个底朝天。”","“Pew,” he cried, “they’ve been before us.Someone’s turned the chest out alow and aloft.”"
"“东西在吗？”皮尤吼道。","“Is it there?” roared Pew."
"“钱在那儿。”","“The money’s there.”"
"瞎子诅咒着钱。","The blind man cursed the money."
"“弗林特的笔迹，我是说。”他叫道。","“Flint’s fist, I mean,” he cried."
"“我们怎么也没找着。”一个人回答道。","“We don’t see it here nohow,” returned the man."
"“嘿，下面的人，它是在比尔身上吗？”瞎子又叫起来。","“Here, you below there, is it on Bill?” cried the blind man again."
"听到这话，另一个家伙、大概是留在楼下搜船长尸体的那个走到店门口。“比尔已经被人搜过身了，”他说，“什么都没有。”","At that another fellow, probably him who had remained below to search the captain’s body, came to the door of the inn.“Bill’s been overhauled a’ready,” said he; “nothin’ left.”"
"“是旅店里的这些人——是那个男孩。我真希望能把他的眼睛挖出来！”那个瞎子皮尤叫道。“他们刚才还在这儿——因为我刚才推门时，门上了闩。小伙子们，分头去搜，找到他们。”","“It’s these people of the inn—it’s that boy.I wish I had put his eyes out!” cried the blind man, Pew.“There were no time ago—they had the door bolted when I tried it.Scatter, lads, and find ‘em.”"
"“是啊，他们的蜡烛还在这儿呢。”一个家伙从窗口说着话。","“Sure enough, they left their glim here,” said the fellow from the window."
"“分头去搜，找到他们！把屋子彻底查个遍！”皮尤反复叫着，用他的棍子敲打着地面。","“Scatter and find ‘em!Rout the house out!” reiterated Pew, striking with his stick upon the road."
"接下来对我们整个老店来说，便是一场巨大的骚乱，沉重的脚步来来回回，家具被翻倒在地，门被踢开，直到那块岩石都发出了回声。他们又出去了，一个接一个到路上去，说哪儿也找不到我们。就在这时，夜空中又划过曾在我和母亲数船长的钱时，把我们吓得够呛的哨声，只是这次更加清晰可辨，还重复了两遍。我原以为这是瞎子在发号施令，可以说是在召集他的船员进攻，但是我现在发现，这个信号来自朝着小村子的那个小山坡，从海盗们对此的反应来看，这是个提醒他们危险逼近的信号。","Then there followed a great to-do through all our old inn, heavy feet pounding to and fro, furniture thrown over, doors kicked in, until the very rocks re-echoed and the men came out again, one after another, on the road and declared that we were nowhere to be found.And just the same whistle that had alarmed my mother and myself over the dead captain’s money was once more clearly audible through the night, but this time twice repeated.I had thought it to be the blind man’s trumpet, so to speak, summoning his crew to the assault, but I now found that it was a signal from the hillside towards the hamlet, and from its effect upon the buccaneers, a signal to warn them of approaching danger."
"“又是德克，”一个人说道。“两次！我们得挪个地方，伙计们。”","“There’s Dirk again,” said one.“Twice! We’ll have to budge, mates.”"
"“挪地方，你们这帮胆小鬼！”皮尤喊道。“德克一开始就是个笨蛋和胆小鬼——你们不要理他。他们一定就在附近，不会太远，你们伸手就可以摸到。分头去找他们，一群狗东西！哦，真可恶，”他叫道，“我要是有眼睛就好了！”","“Budge, you skulk!” cried Pew.“Dirk was a fool and a coward from the first—you wouldn’t mind him.They must be close by; they can’t be far; you have your hands on it.Scatter and look for them, dogs!Oh, shiver my soul,” he cried, “if I had eyes!”"
"这番话似乎起了点作用，因为两个随从已经开始在破烂的家具堆里到处搜查了。不过我觉得他们有些心不在焉。他们一直都在留个心眼盯着自己的危险。其余的人这时站在大路上，举棋不定。","This appeal seemed to produce some effect, for two of the fellows began to look here and there among the lumber, but half-heartedly, I thought, and with half an eye to their own danger all the time, while the rest stood irresolute on the road."
"“你们手中有成千上万的财富，你们这些傻瓜，还在这里拿不定主意！如果你们能找到它，你们就能像国王一样富贵，你们明明知道它就在这儿，却站在那儿躲起来。你们这些人里没有一个敢去面对比尔，可是我做到了——一个瞎子！而我就要因为你们而失去大好的机会！我将要变成一个可怜的乞丐，爬着去讨朗姆酒喝，而我本该坐上马车的！你们只要有饼干里的象鼻虫一样的勇气，就还可以抓住他们。”","“You have your hands on thousands, you fools, and you hang a leg!You’d be as rich as kings if you could find it, and you know it’s here, and you stand there skulking.There wasn’t one of you dared face Bill, and I did it—a blind man!And I’m to lose my chance for you!I’m to be a poor, crawling beggar, sponging for rum, when I might be rolling in a coach!If you had the pluck of a weevil in a biscuit you would catch them still.”"
"“别说了，皮尤，我们已经拿到了西班牙金币！”一个人嘟囔着说。","“Hang it, Pew, we’ve got the doubloons!” grumbled one."
"“他们也许把那该死的东西藏起来了。”另一个说。“带上这几枚硬币吧，皮尤，别站在那儿瞎嚷嚷了。”","“They might have hid the blessed thing,” said another.“Take the Georges, Pew, and don’t stand here squalling.”"
"正是“瞎嚷嚷”这个词，让皮尤的怒气在这些反对声中猛地窜了上来，直到最后。他的怒火完全占了上风，他瞎着眼左右打着他们，他的棍子听上去好像打在了不止一个人身上。","Squalling was the word for it; Pew’s anger rose so high at these objections till at last, his passion completely taking the upper hand, he struck at them right and left in his blindness and his stick sounded heavily on more than one."
"终于，轮到这些人反过来咒骂这个瞎眼的恶棍了，他们用不堪入耳的语言威胁他，还想从他手里夺走拐杖，但没有成功。","These, in their turn, cursed back at the blind miscreant, threatened him in horrid terms, and tried in vain to catch the stick and wrest it from his grasp."
"这场争吵拯救了我们。因为就在他们还闹得不可开交的时候，村子那边的山顶上传来了另一个声音——奔跑的马蹄声。几乎同时，火光一闪，从树篱旁传出一声枪响。这明显是危险迫近的最后信号，因为海盗们立刻转身朝不同的方向分头逃跑了。一个人沿着海湾朝着海那边跑去，另一个人斜穿过小山，如此种种。不到半分钟他们就逃得无影无踪，只剩下皮尤一个人。他们已经把他抛弃了。究竟是因为纯粹的惊慌还是因为报复他的恶言恶语和那顿棒打，我也不知道。但他落在了后面，疯狂地用拐杖敲打着路面，一面摸索着前进，一面喊着他的同伴。最后他转错了弯，从离我几步远的地方经过，向村子方向跑去，边跑边喊：“约翰尼，黑狗，德克，”还有其他名字，“你们别撇下老皮尤，伙计们——别扔下老皮尤！”","This quarrel was the saving of us, for while it was still raging, another sound came from the top of the hill on the side of the hamlet—the tramp of horses galloping.Almost at the same time a pistol-shot, flash and report, came from the hedge side.And that was plainly the last signal of danger, for the buccaneers turned at once and ran, separating in every direction, one seaward along the cove, one slant across the hill, and so on, so that in half a minute not a sign of them remained but Pew.Him they had deserted, whether in sheer panic or out of revenge for his ill words and blows I know not; but there he remained behind, tapping up and down the road in a frenzy, and groping and calling for his comrades.Finally he took a wrong turn and ran a few steps past me, towards the hamlet, crying, “Johnny, Black Dog, Dirk,” and other names, “you won’t leave old Pew, mates—not old Pew!”"
"正在这时，马蹄声越过了山顶，月光下出现了四五个骑马的人，正顺着山坡飞驰而下。","Just then the noise of horses topped the rise, and four or five riders came in sight in the moonlight and swept at full gallop down the slope."
"到这时，皮尤才意识到自己走错了方向，尖叫一声，转身直奔水沟跑去，结果滚进了沟里。但他立刻爬起来，再次猛冲，这回慌忙中正好跌倒在跑过来的马蹄下。","At this Pew saw his error, turned with a scream, and ran straight for the ditch, into which he rolled.But he was on his feet again in a second and made another dash, now utterly bewildered, right under the nearest of the coming horses."
"骑马的人想救他，但已经没用了。皮尤发出一声响彻夜空的惨叫，四只马蹄从他身上践踏过去，弃他而去。他侧身倒下，然后轻轻地瘫倒，脸朝着地，再也不动了。我跳起来，招呼骑马的那些人。他们都勒住马，被这意外事故吓坏了。我很快看清了他们是谁。尾随在其他人后面的那个，是从村里去找利夫西医生的小伙子，其余的都是小伙子在路上碰到的税务官员，小伙子灵机一动就和他们一块立刻返回来了。丹斯队长已经得到了一些基特洞的小帆船的消息，于是他那天晚上朝着我们的方向赶来，母亲和我因此才得以保住性命。","The rider tried to save him, but in vain.Down went Pew with a cry that rang high into the night; and the four hoofs trampled and spurned him and passed by.He fell on his side, then gently collapsed upon his face and moved no more.I leaped to my feet and hailed the riders.They were pulling up, at any rate, horrified at the accident; and I soon saw what they were.One, tailing out behind the rest, was a lad that had gone from the hamlet to Dr. Livesey’s; the rest were revenue officers, whom he had met by the way, and with whom he had had the intelligence to return at once.Some news of the lugger in Kitt’s Hole had found its way to Supervisor Dance and set him forth that night in our direction, and to that circumstance my mother and I owed our preservation from death."
"皮尤已经死了，像石头一样死了。至于我母亲，我们把她送到村子里，用了一点冷水和盐，她很快就又恢复过来，除了还有点惊魂未定，就没什么事了，尽管她还在为没有把钱一分不差地拿走而后悔不已。与此同时，队长以最快的速度继续骑马赶到基特洞。但他的手下不得不下马，牵着或扶着马摸索着走下山谷，而且还要时时提防着埋伏。所以当他们下到基特洞时，小帆船已经开走了，虽然还在近处。他招呼着那艘船。一个声音回应着，叫他离开月光下的地方，否则他就让他挂彩。就在这时，一个枪子儿从他胳膊旁呼啸而过。不一会儿，那艘小帆船就绕过了海角，不见了踪影。丹斯先生站在那里，正如他说的，“像离了水的鱼一样无能为力”，他唯一能做的就是派人去Ｂ镇，向武装快艇报警。“而那个，”他说，“也不管用。他们已经逃脱了，一切都结束了。只是，”他又说道，“我的马踩到了皮尤先生的鸡眼，我还是很高兴的。”因为到这时，他已经听我讲了事情的经过。","Pew was dead, stone dead.As for my mother, when we had carried her up to the hamlet, a little cold water and salts and that soon brought her back again, and she was none the worse for her terror, though she still continued to deplore the balance of the money.In the meantime the supervisor rode on, as fast as he could, to Kitt’s Hole; but his men had to dismount and grope down the dingle, leading, and sometimes supporting, their horses, and in continual fear of ambushes; so it was no great matter for surprise that when they got down to the Hole the lugger was already under way, though still close in.He hailed her.A voice replied, telling him to keep out of the moonlight or he would get some lead in him, and at the same time a bullet whistled close by his arm.Soon after, the lugger doubled the point and disappeared.Mr. Dance stood there, as he said, “like a fish out of water,” and all he could do was to dispatch a man to B—to warn the cutter.“And that,” said he, “is just about as good as nothing.They’ve got off clean, and there’s an end.Only,” he added, “I’m glad I trod on Master Pew’s corns,” for by this time he had heard my story."
"我和他回到“本博将军”旅店，你简直无法想象屋子被破坏成什么样子了。那些家伙疯狂地搜寻母亲和我的时候，把那个钟也砸了个稀巴烂。虽然除了船长的钱袋和抽屉里的一些银子，他们什么东西都没被拿走，可我还是立刻看出来我们完了。丹斯先生对此景感到莫名其妙。","I went back with him to the Admiral Benbow, and you cannot imagine a house in such a state of smash; the very clock had been thrown down by these fellows in their furious hunt after my mother and myself; and though nothing had actually been taken away except the captain’s money-bag and a little silver from the till, I could see at once that we were ruined.Mr. Dance could make nothing of the scene."
"“你说他们拿了钱？好的，那么霍金斯，他们还想要什么？我猜也许是更多的钱？”","“They got the money, you say?Well, then, Hawkins, what in fortune were they after?More money, I suppose?”"
"“不，先生，我认为不是钱。”我回答道。“先生，实际上我相信我胸前的口袋里有那个东西。跟您说实话，我希望能把它放到一个安全的地方。”","“No, sir; not money, I think,” replied I.“In fact, sir, I believe I have the thing in my breast pocket; and to tell you the truth, I should like to get it put in safety.”"
"“当然，孩子，很对，”他说。“你要是愿意的话，我就带上它。”","“To be sure, boy; quite right,” said he.“I’ll take it, if you like.”"
"“我想，利夫西医生也许——”我张口说。","“I thought perhaps Dr. Livesey—” I began."
"“非常正确，”他打断我的话，非常高兴地说，“非常正确——一个绅士和地方官。”现在我意识到，我也应该亲自去他那里，向他或者乡绅报告。皮尤先生已经死了，事已至此，我也没什么后悔的。但是你看，他死了，人们会把这件事提出来去追究一个皇家税务官的责任，如果他们能的话。霍金斯，如果你愿意，现在我要告诉你，我要把你一起带走。”","“Perfectly right,” he interrupted very cheerily, “perfectly right—a gentleman and a magistrate.And, now I come to think of it, I might as well ride round there myself and report to him or squire.Master Pew’s dead, when all’s done; not that I regret it, but he’s dead, you see, and people will make it out against an officer of his Majesty’s revenue, if make it out they can.Now, I’ll tell you, Hawkins, if you like, I’ll take you along.”"
"我真心感谢他的邀请，于是我们走回了马匹所在的小村子。等我把我的意图告诉母亲后，他们都已经坐上马鞍了。","I thanked him heartily for the offer, and we walked back to the hamlet where the horses were.By the time I had told mother of my purpose they were all in the saddle."
"“多格尔，”丹斯先生说，“你有一匹好马，让这孩子坐在你后面。”","“Dogger,” said Mr. Dance, “you have a good horse; take up this lad behind you.”"
"我刚爬上去抓住多格尔的腰带，队长就下令出发了。马队沿着大路向利夫西医生家的方向奔去。","As soon as I was mounted, holding on to Dogger’s belt, the supervisor gave the word, and the party struck out at a bouncing trot on the road to Dr. Livesey’s house."
"第六章 船长的文件","Chapter 6 The Captain’s Papers   "
"我们一路策马飞奔，在利夫西医生家门口停下。屋子前面漆黑一片。","We rode hard all the way till we drew up before Dr. Livesey’s door.The house was all dark to the front."
"丹斯先生叫我跳下马敲门，多格尔给了我一个马蹬，让我下马。门几乎同时被女仆打开了。","Mr. Dance told me to jump down and knock, and Dogger gave me a stirrup to descend by.The door was opened almost at once by the maid."
"“利夫西医生在吗？”我问道。","“Is Dr. Livesey in?” I asked."
"“不，”女仆说，“他下午回了趟家，但是又去乡绅那里与他共进晚餐，打发晚上的时间去了。”","“No,” she said, “he had come home in the afternoon but had gone up to the hall to dine and pass the evening with the squire.”"
"“那么孩子，我们就去那儿吧。”丹斯先生说。","“So there we go, boys,” said Mr. Dance."
"这次由于路不远，我就没骑马，只是拉着多格尔的马蹬皮带一路跑到乡绅的住处门前，沿着月光下树叶稀少的一条长长的林荫路走到一排白色的宅第前，两边是古老的大花园。丹斯先生在这儿下了马，带着我和他一起，通报了一声便被请进屋。","This time, as the distance was short, I did not mount, but ran with Dogger’s stirrup-leather to the lodge gates and up the long, leafless, moonlit avenue to where the white line of the hall buildings looked on either hand on great old gardens.Here Mr. Dance dismounted, and taking me along with him, was admitted at a word into the house."
"仆人领着我们穿过一条铺着垫子的走道，到了尽头一间巨大的书房。书房四面靠墙摆满了书架，顶上还有一些半身塑像，乡绅和利夫西医生分别坐在明亮的壁炉两侧，手里拿着烟斗。","The servant led us down a matted passage and showed us at the end into a great library, all lined with bookcases and busts upon the top of them, where the squire and Dr. Livesey sat, pipe in hand, on either side of a bright fire."
"我从来没有这么近地看过乡绅。他高高的，有六英尺多，身材宽大而比例协调，他的脸粗犷而直率，在长途旅行中变得粗糙、泛红，还起了皱纹。他的眉毛很黑，可以敏捷地动来动去，这让他看上去有点脾气，你会说他不坏，只是性急、容易激动。","I had never seen the squire so near at hand.He was a tall man, over six feet high, and broad in proportion, and he had a bluff, rough-and-ready face, all roughened and reddened and lined in his long travels.His eyebrows were very black, and moved readily, and this gave him a look of some temper, not bad, you would say, but quick and high."
"“丹斯先生，请进。”他非常庄严而谦逊地说。","“Come in, Mr. Dance,” said he, very stately and condescending."
"“晚上好，丹斯。”医生点了下头说。“你也晚上好，我的朋友吉姆。什么风把你们吹到这儿来的？”","“Good evening, Dance,” said the doctor with a nod.“And good evening to you, friend Jim.What good wind brings you here?”"
"队长笔直而僵硬地站起来，像背书一样报告了刚才发生的事。你们真该看看两位绅士的样子：他们身体前倾，你看看我，我看看你，又是惊讶，又是兴趣盎然，连烟都忘了抽。当他们听到我母亲如何回到旅店时，利夫西医生使劲拍了一下自己的大腿，乡绅则叫道“好样的！”然后把他的长烟斗在壁炉上敲断了。离故事讲完还早，特里劳尼先生（你会记住这是乡绅的名字）就从座位上站起来大步在屋子里徘徊，那个医生像是要听到更好的内容，已经摘下了他抹粉的假发，露出剪得很短的黑头发坐在那儿，看上去确实让人很不习惯。","The supervisor stood up straight and stiff and told his story like a lesson; and you should have seen how the two gentlemen leaned forward and looked at each other, and forgot to smoke in their surprise and interest.When they heard how my mother went back to the inn, Dr. Livesey fairly slapped his thigh, and the squire cried “Bravo!” and broke his long pipe against the grate.Long before it was done, Mr. Trelawney (that, you will remember, was the squire’s name) had got up from his seat and was striding about the room, and the doctor, as if to hear the better, had taken off his powdered wig and sat there looking very strange indeed with his own close-cropped black poll."
"终于，丹斯先生讲完了这个故事。","At last Mr. Dance finished the story."
"“丹斯先生，”乡绅说，“你是个非常高尚的人。至于你骑马踩死那个十恶不赦的坏蛋，我认为是件好事，就像踩死一只蟑螂一样。我看霍金斯这个孩子也是好样的。霍金斯，你拉一下那个铃好吗？得请丹斯先生喝点淡啤酒。”","“Mr. Dance,” said the squire, “you are a very noble fellow.And as for riding down that black, atrocious miscreant, I regard it as an act of virtue, sir, like stamping on a cockroach.This lad Hawkins is a trump, I perceive.Hawkins, will you ring that bell?Mr. Dance must have some ale.”"
"“那么，吉姆，”医生说，“你有他们想要的东西，是吗？”","“And so, Jim,” said the doctor, “you have the thing that they were after, have you?”"
"“它在这儿，先生。”我说道，然后把油布包给了他。","“Here it is, sir,” said I, and gave him the oilskin packet."
"医生上上下下地看，手指仿佛痒得想要打开它，但他没这么做，而是静静地把它装进了自己的大衣口袋。","The doctor looked it all over, as if his fingers were itching to open it; but instead of doing that, he put it quietly in the pocket of his coat."
"“乡绅，”他说，“丹斯喝完淡啤酒后当然要动身为陛下效劳。但我想留下吉姆•霍金斯，让他在我房间睡。如果你允许的话，我想我们应该把冷馅饼端上来给他吃。”","“Squire,” said he, “when Dance has had his ale he must, of course, be off on his Majesty’s service; but I mean to keep Jim Hawkins here to sleep at my house, and with your permission, I propose we should have up the cold pie and let him sup.”"
"“随你便吧，利夫西。”乡绅说，“霍金斯已经得到吃比冷馅饼更好的东西了。”","“As you will, Livesey,” said the squire; “Hawkins has earned better than cold pie.”"
"于是一块鸽肉大馅饼被端了进来，放在一张靠边的桌子上，我饿得像鹰一样，美美地饱餐了一顿。丹斯先生得到了更多的赞扬，最后也离去了。","So a big pigeon pie was brought in and put on a sidetable, and I made a hearty supper, for I was as hungry as a hawk, while Mr. Dance was further complimented and at last dismissed."
"“那么现在，乡绅。”医生说。","“And now, squire,” said the doctor."
"“那么现在，利夫西。”乡绅用同样的口气说。","“And now, Livesey,” said the squire in the same breath."
"“一个一个说。”利夫西医生笑着说。“我想，你应该听说过这个弗林特吧？”","“One at a time, one at a time,” laughed Dr. Livesey.“You have heard of this Flint, I suppose?”"
"“听说过他！”乡绅叫道，","“Heard of him!” cried the squire."
"“你说我听说过他！他是海上最凶残的海盗。‘黑胡子’对弗林特来说不过是个毛孩子。先生，我告诉你，西班牙人无比地惧怕他，我有时候还真为他是个英国人而感到自豪呢。我曾亲眼见过他的上桅帆船在特立尼达岛出航，可是跟我航行的一个胆小的酒棍却要后退，后退，先生啊，最后一直退进了西班牙港。”","“Heard of him, you say!He was the bloodthirstiest buccaneer that sailed.Blackbeard was a child to Flint.The Spaniards were so prodigiously afraid of him that, I tell you, sir, I was sometimes proud he was an Englishman.I’ve seen his top-sails with these eyes, off Trinidad, and the cowardly son of a rum-puncheon that I sailed with put back—put back, sir, into Port of Spain.”"
"“哦，我在英国也听说过他的大名，”医生说，“但关键是，他有钱吗？”","“Well, I’ve heard of him myself, in England,” said the doctor. “But the point is, had he money?”"
"“钱！”乡绅喊道。","“Money!” cried the squire."
"“你听说过那个故事吗？除了钱，那些恶棍还在找什么？他们除了钱还关心什么呢？除了钱，还有什么能使他们拿自己一文不值的生命去冒险呢？”","“Have you heard the story?What were these villains after but money?What do they care for but money?For what would they risk their rascal carcasses but money?”"
"“我们很快就会知道。”医生答道。“但是你实在是太头脑发热、大喊大叫了，我都插不了嘴。我想知道的是这个：假如我口袋里有某条关于弗林特埋宝藏的地点的线索，那么宝藏的数量会很大吗？”","“That we shall soon know,” replied the doctor.“But you are so confoundedly hot-headed and exclamatory that I cannot get a word in.What I want to know is this: Supposing that I have here in my pocket some clue to where Flint buried his treasure, will that treasure amount to much?”"
"“数量，先生！”乡绅叫道。","“Amount, sir!” cried the squire."
"“我们不妨这样：如果我们有你说的那条线索，我就会在布里斯托尔码头配备一条船，把你和霍金斯从这带走，然后我要是能找上一年，那我就一定会找到那处宝藏的。”","“It will amount to this: If we have the clue you talk about, I fit out a ship in Bristol dock, and take you and Hawkins here along, and I’ll have that treasure if I search a year.”"
"“很好，”医生说，“那么现在如果吉姆同意，我们就把包裹打开。”他把包放在了自己面前的桌子上。","“Very well,” said the doctor.“Now, then, if Jim is agreeable, we’ll open the packet”; and he laid it before him on the table."
"这捆油布包被缝在了一起，医生不得不拿出自己的工具箱用手术剪刀剪断缝线。油布包里只有两样东西——一个本子和一张封着的纸。","The bundle was sewn together, and the doctor had to get out his instrument case and cut the stitches with his medical scissors.It contained two things—a book and a sealed paper."
"“我们先看看这个本子。”医生观察了一番说。","“First of all we’ll try the book,” observed the doctor."
"医生把本子打开时，我和乡绅一同越过他的肩膀看去，因为利夫西医生已经和善地示意我从刚才吃饭的那张靠墙的桌子那儿过来，和他们一起分享搜寻的快乐。本子第一页上只有一些零星的字迹，就像拿笔的人信手胡乱写上几笔，或者练字时写上几笔。其中一处和船长的纹身记号一样，“比尔·伯恩斯事事如愿”。然后写的是“大副伯恩斯先生”、“朗姆酒没了”、“在棕榈沙滩外他得到了它”，以及一些诸如此类的只言片语，大多数是单个的字眼，让人摸不着头脑。我不禁想知道“得到了它”的是谁，他得到的那个“它”又是什么东西。","The squire and I were both peering over his shoulder as he opened it, for Dr. Livesey had kindly motioned me to come round from the side-table, where I had been eating, to enjoy the sport of the search.On the first page there were only some scraps of writing, such as a man with a pen in his hand might make for idleness or practice.One was the same as the tattoo mark, “Billy Bones his fancy”; then there was “Mr. W.Bones, mate,” “No more rum,” “Off Palm Key he got it,” and some other snatches, mostly single words and unintelligible.I could not help wondering who it was that had “got itt,” and what “itt” was that he got."
"有人在他背后捅了一刀？既像又不像。","A knife in his back as like as not."
"“这儿没有什么线索。”医生一边说一边继续翻本子。","“Not much instruction there,” said Dr. Livesey as he passed on."
"接下来的十或十二页记满了一系列稀奇古怪的条目。每一行的一端记着日期，另一端记着钱的数目，就像普通账簿一样。但是两端之间没有说明性的文字，而画着数量不等的十字符。比如一七四五年的六月十二日，一笔七十镑的钱款显然支付给了某人，但除了有六个十字符，本子上什么说明原因的内容都没有。在一些情况下，当然，会加上诸如“加拉加斯附近”之类的地名，或者只写上经纬度，如“60°17'20”，“19°2'40”。","The next ten or twelve pages were filled with a curious series of entries.There was a date at one end of the line and at the other a sum of money, as in common account-books, but instead of explanatory writing, only a varying number of crosses between the two.On the 12th of June, 1745, for instance, a sum of seventy pounds had plainly become due to someone, and there was nothing but six crosses to explain the cause.In a few cases, to be sure, the name of a place would be added, as “Offe Caraccas,”or a mere entry of latitude and longitude, as “62° 17’ 20”, 19° 2’ 40”."
"这份记录一直延续了近二十年，而且随着时间的推移，分别记录的金额也越来越大，到了最后，虽然有五六个地方加错了，总数仍然非常庞大，而且还加上了附注：“博恩斯，他的财产。”","The record lasted over nearly twenty years, the amount of the separate entries growing larger as time went on, and at the end a grand total had been made out after five or six wrong additions, and these words appended, “Bones, his pile.”"
"“我一点头绪也看不出来。”利夫西医生说。","“I can’t make head or tail of this,” said Dr. Livesey."
"“事情清楚得像正午的太阳，”乡绅叫道。“这就是那个黑心肠恶棍的账本。这些十字符代表他们击沉的船只或掠夺的城镇的名字。而这些金额则是这个恶棍的份额，你们看，在他担心混淆的地方，他加了一些更清楚的说明。比如说这里的‘加拉加斯附近’，你们看，这里表示某艘倒霉的船只在那个海岸遭到了袭击。愿上帝保佑那些船上的灵魂吧——他们早就变成珊瑚了。”","“The thing is as clear as noonday,” cried the squire.“This is the black-hearted hound’s account-book.These crosses stand for the names of ships or towns that they sank or plundered.The sums are the scoundrel’s share, and where he feared an ambiguity, you see he added something clearer.‘Offe Caraccas,’ now; you see, here was some unhappy vessel boarded off that coast.God help the poor souls that manned her—coral long ago.”"
"“对啊！”医生说。","“Right!” said the doctor,"
"“看来你真是个旅行家。对！你看，数目是随着他地位的不断上升而增加的。”","“See what it is to be a traveller. Right! And the amounts increase, you see, as he rose in rank.”"
"本子上记的几乎没什么了，除了最后几页上记了一些地点的位置，另外还有一张法国、英国和西班牙货币的通用价值换算表。","There was little else in the volume but a few bearings of places noted in the blank leaves towards the end and a table for reducing French, English, and Spanish moneys to a common value."
"“精打细算的家伙！”医生喊道，","“Thrifty man!” cried the doctor."
"“谁也别想骗他。”","“He wasn’t the one to be cheated.”"
"“那现在，”乡绅说，“看看另一样东西吧。”","“And now,” said the squire, “for the other.”"
"那张纸有好几个地方都是用顶针封住的，那个顶针可能就是我在船长口袋里发现的那个。医生小心翼翼地打开了那些封口，掉出来一张岛屿地图，还有经纬度和水深，小山、小岛和港湾的名字，还有能够引领一艘船到达一个安全的停泊处可能需要的每一处细节信息。这个岛长约九英里，宽约五英里，你也许会说它的形状像一条站立的胖龙，还有两个被陆地环抱的避风港，岛中央有一座标着“望远镜”的小山。有几处较近日期的附注，尤其是有三个用红墨水写的十字符——其中两个在岛的北边，另外一个在西南方向——而且那个西南方向的十字符旁边用同样的红色墨水写着整洁小巧的字，字迹和船长歪七扭八的风格非常不同，这些字是：“这里有大部分宝藏。”","The paper had been sealed in several places with a thimble by way of seal; the very thimble, perhaps, that I had found in the captain’s pocket.The doctor opened the seals with great care, and there fell out the map of an island, with latitude and longitude, soundings, names of hills and bays and inlets, and every particular that would be needed to bring a ship to a safe anchorage upon its shores.It was about nine miles long and five across, shaped, you might say, like a fat dragon standing up, and had two fine land-locked harbours, and a hill in the centre part marked “The Spy-glass.”There were several additions of a later date, but above all, three crosses of red ink—two on the north part of the island, one in the southwest—and beside this last, in the same red ink, and in a small, neat hand, very different from the captain’s tottery characters, these words: “Bulk of treasure here.”"
"同一个人还在地图的背面写了更进一步的信息：高树、“望远镜”山脊，方位北北东偏北，骷髅岛东南东偏东十英里。银条在北面密窖，你可以顺着东边圆丘的斜坡，在正对着黑岩石南十英寻处找到它。武器很容易找到，就在北面海湾北角的沙丘内，方位正东偏北四分之一处。这就是写下的全部了。尽管很简洁，而且我根本没有看懂，但乡绅和利夫西医生却大喜过望。","Over on the back the same hand had written this further information: Tall tree, Spy-glass shoulder, bearing a point tothe N.of N.N.E.Skeleton Island E.S.E.and by E.Ten feet.The bar silver is in the north cache; you can find it by the trend of the east hummock, ten fathoms south of the black crag with the face on it.The arms are easy found, in the sand-hill, N. point of north inlet cape, bearing E.and aquarter N.J.F.That was all; but brief as it was, and to me incomprehensible, it filled the squire and Dr. Livesey with delight."
"“利夫西，”乡绅说，“你会立刻放弃这个悲惨的工作。明天我就出发去布里斯托尔。三个星期之内——三个星期！——两个星期——十天——我们就会有英国最好的船和最优秀的船员，先生。霍金斯就在船上当服务生。你会成为著名的服务生，霍金斯。你，利夫西，是船上的医生。我是司令。我们会带上雷德鲁斯、乔伊斯和亨特。我们会一路顺风，旅途快捷，而且不会有丝毫困难就能找到那个地方。从此之后我们就财源滚滚，花钱像扔石子一样。","“Livesey,” said the squire, “you will give up this wretched practice at once.Tomorrow I start for Bristol.In three weeks’ time—three weeks!—two weeks—ten days—we’ll have the best ship, sir, and the choicest crew in England.Hawkins shall come as cabin-boy.You’ll make a famous cabin-boy, Hawkins.You, Livesey, are ship’s doctor; I am admiral.We’ll take Redruth, Joyce, and Hunter.We’ll have favourable winds, a quick passage, and not the least difficulty in finding the spot, and money to eat, to roll in, to play duck and drake with ever after.”"
"“特里劳尼，”医生说，“我会跟你一起去，而且我保证吉姆也会去的，而且保证会做好自己的工作。只有一个人让我担心。”","“Trelawney,” said the doctor, “I’ll go with you; and I’ll go bail for it, so will Jim, and be a credit to the undertaking.There’s only one man I’m afraid of.”"
"“那人是谁？”乡绅叫道。“说出这狗东西的名字，先生！”","“And who’s that?” cried the squire.“Name the dog, sir!”"
"“你。”医生回答道，“因为你管不住自己的舌头。我们不是唯一知道这份文件的人。今晚袭击这家旅馆的这些匪徒——全都是凶狠的亡命徒，毫无疑问——还有剩下的呆在小帆船上的家伙，还有更多，我敢说他们没走多远。他们中任何一个和所有人都会不顾一切想把钱弄到手。在出海之前，我们谁都别单独出门。吉姆和我这会儿要呆在一起，你骑马去布里斯托尔时要带上乔伊斯和亨特。自始至终我们一个人都不能走漏风声，把我们发现的东西说出去。","“You,” replied the doctor; “for you cannot hold your tongue.We are not the only men who know of this paper.These fellows who attacked the inn tonight—bold, desperate blades, for sure—and the rest who stayed aboard that lugger, and more, I dare say, not far off, are, one and all, through thick and thin, bound that they’ll get that money.We must none of us go alone till we get to sea.Jim and I shall stick together in the meanwhile; you’ll take Joyce and Hunter when you ride to Bristol, and from first to last, not one of us must breathe a word of what we’ve found.”"
"“利夫西，”乡绅回应道，“你说的话总有道理。我一定守口如瓶。”","“Livesey,” returned the squire, “you are always in the right of it.I’ll be as silent as the grave.”"
"第七章 我去布里斯托尔","Chapter 7 I Go to Bristol "
"我们为这次出海准备的时间比乡绅原来想象的时间要长，而且没有一个我们最初的计划能够像我们打算的那样顺利进行,甚至连利夫西医生要我留在他身边的计划也是如此。医生不得不去伦敦找一个医师代管他的业务。乡绅在布里斯托尔工作忙碌。我则住在庄园里由猎场主管老雷德鲁斯照料，简直就像个囚犯，但是我心中却充满了对海的憧憬和对奇异岛屿及冒险旅行最美好的期盼。我花了数个小时研究地图，边看边沉思，把上面的每个细节都牢牢记在心里。我坐在管家屋子里的壁炉旁边，想象着从各个不同的方向到达那个岛屿，想象着将那岛上的每一亩土地都探索一遍，想象着我上千次爬上那座称作“望远镜”的高山，从山顶尽情地欣赏变幻无穷的美景。有时岛上到处都是野蛮人，我们得和他们打仗，有时岛上到处都是危险的野兽在追赶我们。但是我想象中的奇遇完全没有像我们实际的探险那样不同寻常，那样悲惨。就这样过了一个又一个星期，直到一个晴朗的日子，我们收到了一封寄给利夫西医生的信，信上注明“如本人不在，可由雷德鲁斯或小霍金斯打开。”遵照这个指示，我们发现，或者更确切地说是我发现了（因为猎场主管阅读任何东西都费劲，只认识印刷体的字）以下重要消息：","It was longer than the squire imagined ere we were ready for the sea, and none of our first plans—not even Dr. Livesey’s, of keeping me beside him—could be carried out as we intended.The doctor had to go to London for a physician to take charge of his practice; the squire was hard at work at Bristol; and I lived on at the hall under the charge of old Redruth, the gamekeeper, almost a prisoner, but full of sea-dreams and the most charming anticipations of strange islands and adventures.I brooded by the hour together over the map, all the details of which I well remembered.Sitting by the fire in the housekeeper’s room, I approached that island in my fancy from every possible direction; I explored every acre of its surface; I climbed a thousand times to that tall hill they call the Spy-glass, and from the top enjoyed the most wonderful and changing prospects.Sometimes the isle was thick with savages, with whom we fought, sometimes full of dangerous animals that hunted us, but in all my fancies nothing occurred to me so strange and tragic as our actual adventures.So the weeks passed on, till one fine day there came a letter addressed to Dr. Livesey, with this addition, “To be opened, in the case of his absence, by Tom Redruth or young Hawkins.”Obeying this order, we found, or rather I found—for the gamekeeper was a poor hand at reading anything but print—the following important news:"
"于布里斯托尔老锚旅店，一七ＸＸ年三月一日——亲爱的利夫西——","Old Anchor Inn, Bristol, March 1, 17—Dear Livesey—"
"由于我不知道你究竟是在庄园还是仍在伦敦，所以此信我写了两份，分别寄往这两个地点。","As I do not know whether you are at the hall or still in London, I send this in double to both places."
"船已经买好，并已装备妥当。她就停泊在港口，准备出海。你怎么也想象不到这条纵帆船有多么漂亮——一个小孩子都能驾驶她——船载重两百吨，船名为伊斯帕尼奥拉号。","The ship is bought and fitted.She lies at anchor, ready for sea.You never imagined a sweeter schooner—a child might sail her—two hundred tons; name, HISPANIOLA."
"这艘船我是从老朋友布兰德里那儿得到的，他可是个绝对地道的好人。这位令人尊敬的家伙在我关心的这件事上简直是拼了命，我可以说，布里斯托尔的每个人都会这么拼命的，只要他们听到一点我们要去的港口的风声——我指的是宝藏。","I got her through my old friend, Blandly, who has proved himself throughout the most surprising trump.The admirable fellow literally slaved in my interest, and so, I may say, did everyone in Bristol, as soon as they got wind of the port we sailed for—treasure, I mean."
"“雷德鲁斯，”我念到这里停下说，“利夫西医生不会喜欢这样的。乡绅到底还是把事情说出去了。”“那么，谁更对呢？”猎场看守人低声地怒吼道，“我才不认为乡绅会因为利夫西医生就闭上嘴呢。”听了这话，我放弃了所有评论的想法，径直读下去：","“Redruth,” said I, interrupting the letter, “Dr. Livesey will not like that.The squire has been talking, after all.”“Well, who’s a better right?” growled the gamekeeper.“A pretty rum go if squire ain’t to talk for Dr. Livesey, I should think.”At that I gave up all attempts at commentary and read straight on:"
"布兰德里亲自发现了伊斯帕尼奥拉号船，而且发挥了他令人敬佩的手段，以低廉的价格买到了这艘船。布里斯托尔有那么一帮人恨透了布兰德里。他们离谱地说这个老实人为了钱什么事都做得出来，还说伊斯帕尼奥拉号是他自己的船，他卖给我时，价格高得荒唐——最显而易见的诋毁。不论如何，他们谁都不敢否认这条船的优点。","Blandly himself found the HISPANIOLA, and by the most admirable management got her for the merest trifle.There is a class of men in Bristol monstrously prejudiced against Blandly.They go the length of declaring that this honest creature would do anything for money, that the HISPANIOLA belonged to him, and that he sold it me absurdly high—the most transparent calumnies.None of them dare, however, to deny the merits of the ship."
"到目前为止，没什么不顺利的。那帮工人，确切地说是装索具的工人们，手脚慢得令人恼火，但是时间解决了这个问题。真正令我心烦的是船员。","So far there was not a hitch.The workpeople, to be sure—riggers and what not—were most annoyingly slow; but time cured that.It was the crew that troubled me."
"我希望能找到整整二十个船员，以对付土著，海盗或那些可恶的法国人。但我担心我倒霉得只能找到半数的人，直到命运之神惊人地给我带来了一个我求之不得的人。","I wished a round score of men—in case of natives, buccaneers, or the odious French—and I had the worry of the deuce itself to find so much as half a dozen, till the most remarkable stroke of fortune brought me the very man that I required."
"我当时正站在码头上，非常偶然地和这个人攀谈起来。我得知他是个老水手，开了一间小酒吧，认识布里斯托尔所有的海员。他在岸上身体不好，想找个当厨师的好差事，再回到海上去。他说那天早上他一瘸一拐地到了那儿，想闻一闻海水的咸味儿。","I was standing on the dock, when, by the merest accident, I fell in talk with him.I found he was an old sailor, kept a public-house, knew all the seafaring men in Bristol, had lost his health ashore, and wanted a good berth as cook to get to sea again.He had hobbled down there that morning, he said, to get a smell of the salt."
"我大受感动——换了你也会的——于是出于纯粹的同情，我让他担任我们船上的厨师。他叫做“高个子约翰·西尔弗”，失去了一条腿，但是我觉得这是个优点，因为他是在不朽的霍克统治下为祖国服务才失去了那条腿。他没有养老金，利夫西。想想我们生活的时代是多么可恶！","I was monstrously touched—so would you have been—and, out of pure pity, I engaged him on the spot to be ship’s cook.Long John Silver, he is called, and has lost a leg; but that I regarded as a recommendation, since he lost it in his country’s service, under the immortal Hawke.He has no pension, Livesey.Imagine the abominable age we live in!"
"那么先生，我原以为我只找到了一个厨师，但我却得到了一队的船员。几天的功夫，我和西尔弗就找到了一批可以想象到的最坚强的老水手——不是那些徒有其表的家伙，而是那种凭他们的面孔就能断定具有最坚韧不拔意志的人。我可以说，我们能和一艘三帆快速战舰作战。","Well, sir, I thought I had only found a cook, but it was a crew I had discovered.Between Silver and myself we got together in a few days a company of the toughest old salts imaginable—not pretty to look at, but fellows, by their faces, of the most indomitable spirit.I declare we could fight a frigate."
"高个子约翰甚至从我已经雇佣的六七个人中辞去了两个人。他当即就给我指出来，那两个人是在淡水里泡大的没经验的饭桶，我们在重要探险中最怕带上这种人。","Long John even got rid of two out of the six or seven I had already engaged.He showed me in a moment that they were just the sort of fresh-water swabs we had to fear in an adventure of importance."
"我现在身心状况都非常不错，吃饭香得像头牛，睡觉死得像棵树，但只要一刻没听到老海员在绞盘周围起锚的声音，我就一刻也享受不到愉悦。嗬，出海啦！去一边的宝藏！令我心旷神怡的是海上的壮丽景色。所以现在，利夫西，快来吧。如果你还瞧得起我的话，那就一个小时也不要耽搁。","I am in the most magnificent health and spirits, eating like a bull, sleeping like a tree, yet I shall not enjoy a moment till I hear my old tarpaulins tramping round the capstan.Seaward, ho!Hang the treasure!It’s the glory of the sea that has turned my head.So now, Livesey, come post; do not lose an hour, if you respect me."
"叫小霍金斯立刻去看看他的母亲，并让雷德鲁斯一路保护着他，然后让他俩全速赶到布里斯托尔来。","Let young Hawkins go at once to see his mother, with Redruth for a guard; and then both come full speed to Bristol."
"约翰·特里劳尼附言——我忘记告诉你，布兰德里说如果我们八月底还没有回来，他将派一艘船去找我们。他还找到了一个可敬的人做船长——很遗憾是个固执的人，但在其他方面却是个难得的人才。高个子约翰·西尔弗找来了一个能力出众的人当大副，名字叫阿罗。我找了一个会吹哨子的水手长，所以利夫西，将来伊斯帕尼奥拉号上的一切都将按军舰的作风行事。我忘了告诉你，西尔弗是个有钱人。我亲自了解到，他有一个银行账号，而且从来没有透支过。他留下他的妻子来照料旅店的生意，由于她是个黑人，所以你我这样的老光棍是有理由猜测他再度出海漂泊不仅是因为健康的原因，还因为这个妻子。","John Trelawney Postscript—I did not tell you that Blandly,who, by the way, is to send a consort after us if we don’t turn up by the end of August, had found an admirable fellow for sailing master—a stiff man, which I regret, but in all other respects a treasure.Long John Silver unearthed a very competent man for a mate, a man named Arrow.I have a boatswain who pipes, Livesey; so things shall go man-o’-war fashion on board the good ship HISPANIOLA.I forgot to tell you that Silver is a man of substance; I know of my own knowledge that he has a banker’s account, which has never been overdrawn.He leaves his wife to manage the inn; and as she is a woman of colour, a pair of old bachelors like you and I may be excused for guessing that it is the wife, quite as much as the health, that sends him back to roving."
"约翰·特里劳尼再附言——霍金斯可以和他母亲住一晚。"," J. T. P.P.S.—Hawkins may stay one night with his mother."
"约翰·特里劳尼你可以想象这封信给我带来了多大的激动。我欣喜若狂。如果我曾经瞧不起什么人的话，那就是老汤姆·雷德鲁斯了，因为他除了嘟嘟囔囔地唉声叹气以外，什么都不会做。任何一个猎场看守人的手下都巴不得和他换换位置。但是乡绅是不会乐意这样的，而乡绅的好恶对所有人来说就像是法律一样。除了老雷德鲁斯，他们连嘀咕几句都不敢。","J.T.You can fancy the excitement into which that letter put me.I was half beside myself with glee; and if ever I despised a man, it was old Tom Redruth, who could do nothing but grumble and lament.Any of the under-gamekeepers would gladly have changed places with him; but such was not the squire’s pleasure, and the squire’s pleasure was like law among them all.Nobody but old Redruth would have dared so much as even to grumble."
"第二天早晨，我和雷德鲁斯步行去“本博将军”旅店，在那儿我发现母亲的身体和精神都很好。那个长期以来一直使这里不得安宁的船长，已经去了他再也闹不起来的地方了。乡绅叫人修好了店里的一切，还将客厅和招牌重新油漆了一遍，并添置了一些家具——特别是在酒吧里给母亲添了一把漂亮的扶手椅。他还给母亲找来了一个男孩当学徒，这样我走了之后，母亲能有个帮手。","The next morning he and I set out on foot for the Admiral Benbow, and there I found my mother in good health and spirits.The captain, who had so long been a cause of so much discomfort, was gone where the wicked cease from troubling.The squire had had everything repaired, and the public rooms and the sign repainted, and had added some furniture—above all a beautiful armchair for mother in the bar.He had found her a boy as an apprentice also so that she should not want help while I was gone."
"我见到那个男孩后，才第一次明白自己的处境。在那以前，我满脑子想的都是即将到来的探险，根本没想过要离开这个家。而现在看到这个笨手笨脚的陌生人将顶替我的位置留在母亲身边，我才第一次感到泪水要涌出来。恐怕我给那个男孩带来了牛马不如的生活。因为他在这份工作上是个新手，我有上百个机会纠正他、指责他，而且我不会慢下来，放过这些机会。","It was on seeing that boy that I understood, for the first time, my situation.I had thought up to that moment of the adventures before me, not at all of the home that I was leaving; and now, at sight of this clumsy stranger, who was to stay here in my place beside my mother, I had my first attack of tears.I am afraid I led that boy a dog’s life, for as he was new to the work, I had a hundred opportunities of setting him right and putting him down, and I was not slow to profit by them."
"过了一夜，第二天吃过午饭，雷德鲁斯和我又上路了。我告别了母亲，告别了出生以来一直生活的小海湾，告别了亲爱的老“本博将军”旅店——自从被重新油漆过后，它就不像以前那么可爱了。我最后想到了船长，他常常沿着海边散步，帽子歪戴在一边，面颊上留着刀疤，还有他那旧黄铜望远镜。我们一会儿就绕过了拐角，我的家也从视线中消失了。","The night passed, and the next day, after dinner, Redruth and I were afoot again and on the road.I said good-bye to Mother and the cove where I had lived since I was born, and the dear old Admiral Benbow—since he was repainted, no longer quite so dear.One of my last thoughts was of the captain, who had so often strode along the beach with his cocked hat, his sabre-cut cheek, and his old brass telescope.Next moment we had turned the corner and my home was out of sight."
"黄昏时分，邮车在荒野上的“乔治王”旅店载上了我们。我被挤在雷德鲁斯和一个强壮的老绅士中间。尽管车子驾得飞快，夜里也凉气袭人，但我一定是从一开始上车就打瞌睡，接着就睡得像根木头，一站又一站地上山入谷。我最后被人捅了一下肋骨才终于醒了过来。我睁开眼睛时发现我们正静静地站在城市街道上一座大楼前，天已经亮了很久了。","The mail picked us up about dusk at the Royal George on the heath.I was wedged in between Redruth and a stout old gentleman, and in spite of the swift motion and the cold night air, I must have dozed a great deal from the very first,and then slept like a log up hill and down dale through stage after stage, for when I was awakened at last it was by a punch in the ribs, and I opened my eyes to find that we were standing still before a large building in a city street and that the day had already broken a long time."
"“我们在哪儿？”我问。","“Where are we?” I asked."
"“布里斯托尔。”汤姆说，“下车吧。”","“Bristol,” said Tom. “Get down.”"
"特里劳尼先生已经决定在码头尽头的一家旅店下榻，以便监督纵帆船的工作。我们得朝那儿走过去，而我感到特别高兴的是，码头沿路和旁边都是各种的大小不一、装备各异、国籍不同的船只。有一艘船上的水手们正在一边工作一边唱歌，另一艘船上的水手们则吊在帆索上爬到了我头顶上方的高处，那帆索看上去比蜘蛛丝粗不了多少。虽然我一辈子都生活在海边，我却仿佛到这时才真正靠近大海。柏油和海盐的味道也显得那么新鲜。我看到了最最漂亮的船头雕饰，它们都到过远洋。我还看到了许多水手，他们耳朵上挂着耳环，留着卷成圈的络腮胡须，辫子抹了发油，一摇一摆地迈着笨拙的水手步子。就算我看到许多国王和主教，也不会比这更开心。","Mr. Trelawney had taken up his residence at an inn far down the docks to superintend the work upon the schooner.Thither we had now to walk, and our way, to my great delight, lay along the quays and beside the great multitude of ships of all sizes and rigs and nations.In one, sailors were singing at their work, in another there were men aloft, high over my head, hanging to threads that seemed no thicker than a spider’s.Though I had lived by the shore all my life, I seemed never to have been near the sea till then.The smell of tar and salt was something new.I saw the most wonderful figureheads, that had all been far over the ocean.I saw, besides, many old sailors, with rings in their ears, and whiskers curled in ringlets, and tarry pigtails, and their swaggering, clumsy sea-walk; and if I had seen as many kings or archbishops I could not have been more delighted."
"我也要自己出海了，要坐上纵帆船出海，船上有吹哨子的水手长和留着辫子、唱着歌的水手。我就要出海了，去一座未知的小岛，寻找埋藏的宝藏！","And I was going to sea myself, to sea in a schooner, with a piping boatswain and pig-tailed singing seamen, to sea, bound for an unknown island, and to seek for buried treasure!"
"当我还沉浸在这令人愉快的梦中时，我们突然到了一家大旅店门前。乡绅特里劳尼盛装打扮得像个海上军官，穿着结实的蓝色布料做的衣服，面带微笑，模仿着船长迈着水手步走出门来。","While I was still in this delightful dream, we came suddenly in front of a large inn and met Squire Trelawney, all dressed out like a sea-officer, in stout blue cloth, coming out of the door with a smile on his face and a capital imitation of a sailor’s walk."
"“你们来啦，”他叫道，“医生昨天晚上从伦敦过来了。太好了！船上的人都齐了！”","“Here you are,” he cried, “and the doctor came last night from London.Bravo!The ship’s company complete!”"
"“哦，先生，”我叫道，“我们什么时候出海？”","“Oh, sir,” cried I, “when do we sail?”"
"“出海！”他说。","“Sail!” said he."

"吃完早饭，乡绅给了我一张写给约翰·西尔弗的便条，地方在挂着“望远镜”招牌的酒馆那里。他告诉我，只要沿着往码头的路线走，并且时刻留意一家挂着一个大大的黄铜望远镜当招牌小酒馆，就应该能很容易找到那个地方。我出发了，因为有机会看到更多一些的船只和水手而感到格外喜悦，因为现在正是码头最繁忙的时候。我选择在拥挤的人群、马车和货物中间的一条路穿行，直到我发现了那个之前提到的小酒馆。","When I had done breakfasting the squire gave me a note addressed to John Silver, at the sign of the Spy-glass, and told me I should easily find the place by following the line of the docks and keeping a bright lookout for a little tavern with a large brass telescope for sign.I set off, overjoyed at this opportunity to see some more of the ships and seamen, and picked my way among a great crowd of people and carts and bales, for the dock was now at its busiest, until I found the tavern in question."
"这个小地方是个足够明亮的娱乐场所。招牌刚刚油漆过，窗上挂着整洁的红窗帘，地上铺着干净的沙子。酒馆两侧各有一条街道，酒馆也在两条街道上各开有一扇门。因此，尽管酒店里烟雾弥漫，人们还是能将低矮而宽敞的屋子看得一清二楚。","It was a bright enough little place of entertainment.The sign was newly painted; the windows had neat red curtains; the floor was cleanly sanded.There was a street on each side and an open door on both, which made the large, low room pretty clear to see in, in spite of clouds of tobacco smoke."
"顾客们大多是海员，他们说话声都很大，我站在门口几乎都不敢进去。","The customers were mostly seafaring men, and they talked so loudly that I hung at the door, almost afraid to enter."
"就在我等在门口时，侧面一间屋子里出来一个人，我一眼就认定他准是高个子约翰。他的左腿在靠近臀部的地方被截掉了，左肩下的拐杖却被他掌控得格外灵活，他拄着拐杖一蹦一跳的样子简直像只鸟。他身材高大，体格强壮，他的脸大得像火腿，且相貌平平、脸色苍白，但却透着机智，挂着微笑。他看上去确实心情极好，往返于桌子之间，吹着口哨，跟那些比较熟的客人说两句笑话，或者拍拍他们的肩膀。","As I was waiting, a man came out of a side room, and at a glance I was sure he must be Long John.His left leg was cut off close by the hip, and under the left shoulder he carried a crutch, which he managed with wonderful dexterity, hopping about upon it like a bird.He was very tall and strong, with a face as big as a ham—plain and pale, but intelligent and smiling.Indeed, he seemed in the most cheerful spirits, whistling as he moved about among the tables, with a merry word or a slap on the shoulder for the more favoured of his guests."
"现在，和你说实话，从乡绅特里劳尼在信里第一次提到大个子约翰起，我心里就一直害怕他可能就是那个独腿水手，那个我在本博老店里关注了很久的独腿水手。但是一看到眼前这个人，我就足以放心了。我已经见识过船长、黑狗和瞎子皮尤，我认为自己知道一个海盗是什么样子——在我看来会是个和这位衣着整洁又脾气好的店主极为不同的家伙。","Now, to tell you the truth, from the very first mention of Long John in Squire Trelawney’s letter I had taken a fear in my mind that he might prove to be the very one-legged sailor whom I had watched for so long at the old Benbow.But one look at the man before me was enough.I had seen the captain, and Black Dog, and the blind man, Pew, and I thought I knew what a buccaneer was like—a very different creature, according to me, from this clean and pleasant-tempered landlord."
"我立刻鼓起勇气，跨过门槛，径直走到这个人站的地方。他正拄着拐杖和一位顾客交谈。","I plucked up courage at once, crossed the threshold, and walked right up to the man where he stood, propped on his crutch, talking to a customer."
"“您是西尔弗先生吗？”我问道，手里拿着那个便条。","“Mr. Silver, sir?” I asked, holding out the note."
"“是的，我的孩子，”他说道，“正是我的名字，没错。你是谁呀？”然后他看到了乡绅的信，我觉得他几乎像是吓了一跳。","“Yes, my lad,” said he; “such is my name, to be sure.And who may you be?”And then as he saw the squire’s letter, he seemed to me to give something almost like a start."
"“噢！”他一边相当大声地说着，一边伸出手来。“我明白了。你是我们新来的服务生，我很高兴见到你。”","“Oh!” said he, quite loud, and offering his hand.“I see.You are our new cabin-boy; pleased I am to see you.”"
"他的一只大手紧紧握住了我的手。","And he took my hand in his large firm grasp."
"就在这时，坐在远处的一位顾客突然站起身来，向门口走去。门离他很近，他一转眼就到了街上。但他匆忙的举动引起了我的注意，我一眼就认出了他。他正是最早来“本博将军”旅店的那个脸上脂肪很多、缺两根手指的家伙。","Just then one of the customers at the far side rose suddenly and made for the door.It was close by him, and he was out in the street in a moment.But his hurry had attracted my notice, and I recognized him at glance.It was the tallow-faced man, wanting two fingers, who had come first to the Admiral Benbow."
"“啊，”我叫出声来，“让他站住！他是黑狗！”","“Oh,” I cried, “stop him! It’s Black Dog!”"
"“我才不管他是谁呢，”西尔弗叫道。“但是他还没有付钱。”“哈里，快去把他抓回来。”紧挨门的另一个人立刻跳起来追了出去。","“I don’t care two coppers who he is,” cried Silver.“But he hasn’t paid his score.Harry, run and catch him.”One of the others who was nearest the door leaped up and started in pursuit."
"“就算他是霍克将军，他也得付钱，”西尔弗叫道，然后他松开我的手问，“你刚才说他是谁？","“If he were Admiral Hawke he shall pay his score,” cried Silver; and then, relinquishing my hand, “Who did you say he was?” he asked."
"黑什么？”","“Black what?”"
"“黑狗，先生。”我回答道。“特里劳尼先生没有告诉您那些海盗的事吗？他就是其中之一。”“是吗？”西尔弗叫道。“在我的房子里！本，快跑去帮哈里一把。他就是那帮狗东西之一吗？摩根，你刚才是和他在一起喝酒来着吗？过来。”","“Dog, sir,” said I.“Has Mr. Trelawney not told you of the buccaneers?He was one of them.”“So?” cried Silver.“In my house!Ben, run and help Harry.One of those swabs, was he?Was that you drinking with him, Morgan? Step up here.”"
"那个被他叫做摩根的人是个上了岁数、头发花白、面色暗红的水手。他顺从地走过来，嘴里嚼着烟草块。","The man whom he called Morgan—an old, grey-haired, mahogany-faced sailor—came forward pretty sheepishly, rolling his quid."
"“现在，摩根，”高个子约翰非常严厉地说，“你以前从来没见过那个黑——黑狗，是吗？”","“Now, Morgan,” said Long John very sternly, “you never clapped your eyes on that Black- Black Dog before, did you, now?”"
"“我没见过，先生。”摩根敬了个礼，说道。","“Not I, sir,” said Morgan with a salute."
"“你不知道他的名字，是吗？”","“You didn’t know his name, did you?”"
"“不知道，先生。”","“No, sir.”"
"“老天，汤姆·摩根，算你走运！”酒店老板嚷道。“你听明白了，如果你和那样的家伙混在一起，就别想再进我的店门一步，。他都和你说了些什么？”","“By the powers, Tom Morgan, it’s as good for you!” exclaimed the landlord.“If you had been mixed up with the like of that, you would never have put another foot in my house, you may lay to that.And what was he saying to you?”"
"“我不大明白，先生。”摩根回答说。","“I don’t rightly know, sir,” answered Morgan."
"“你管自己肩膀上的东西叫脑袋，还是该死的三孔滑车？”高个子约翰叫起来。“不大明白，你不明白！可能你连自己现在和谁说话都搞不明白，是不是？现在过来，他刚才说了些什么，航行，船长，还是船？快说！他说了什么？”","“Do you call that a head on your shoulders, or a blessed dead-eye?” cried Long John.“Don’t rightly know, don’t you!Perhaps you don’t happen to rightly know who you was speaking to, perhaps?Come, now, what was he jawing-v’yages, cap’ns, ships?Pipe up! What was it?”"
"“我们在谈拖龙骨。”摩根答道。","“We was a-talkin’ of keel-hauling,”answered Morgan."
"“拖龙骨，是吗？是个非常合适的话题，你们会明白的。给我滚回去，你这没用的东西，汤姆。”","“Keel-hauling, was you?And a mighty suitable thing, too, and you may lay to that.Get back to your place for a lubber, Tom.”"
"等摩根回到自己的座位上后，西尔弗用一种让我觉得非常受捧的态度悄声对我说：“他是个诚实的人，汤姆·摩根，只是有一点蠢。那么现在，”他又继续大声地说，“让我们看看——黑狗？不，我不知道那个名字，我不知道。不过我似乎记起来了，我曾经——对，我见过这个狗东西。他过去常常和一个瞎子乞丐来这里，他常来。”","And then, as Morgan rolled back to his seat, Silver added to me in a confidential whisper that was very flattering, as I thought, “He’s quite an honest man, Tom Morgan, on’y stupid.And now,” he ran on again, aloud, “let’s see—Black Dog?No, I don’t know the name, not I.Yet I kind of think I’ve—yes, I’ve seen the swab.He used to come here with a blind beggar, he used.”"
"“肯定是他，你可以肯定。”我说。“我也知道那个瞎子。他叫皮尤。”","“That he did, you may be sure,” said I.“I knew that blind man too.His name was Pew.”"
"“就是他！”西尔弗叫起来，现在格外地兴奋。“皮尤！那准是他的名字。噢，他看起来像只鲨鱼，是的。如果我们能逮住这个黑狗，那就有消息报告给特里劳尼船长了！本是个飞毛腿，没有几个水手跑得过他。他肯定能追上黑狗，稳拿黑狗，上帝助他一臂之力！他谈到拖龙骨，是吗？我一定拖他的龙骨！”","“It was!” cried Silver, now quite excited.“Pew!That were his name for certain.Ah, he looked a shark, he did!If we run down this Black Dog, now, there’ll be news for Cap’n Trelawney!Ben’s a good runner; few seamen run better than Ben.He should run him down, hand over hand, by the powers!He talked o’ keel-hauling, did he?I’LL keel-haul him!”"
"他急着说这番话时，一直拄着拐杖在酒店里跳来跳去，还时不时地拍着桌子，那副激动的样子简直可以说服一个伦敦中央刑事法庭的法官或博街的警察。当发现黑狗出现在“望远镜”旅店之后，我又起了疑心，并注意着这个厨师的一举一动。但他对我来说城府太深，反应太快，聪明透顶。那两个人上气不接下气跑回来说，那人在人群中找不着了，高个子约翰像骂小偷一样把他们骂了一顿，我简直可以证明高个子约翰的清白。","All the time he was jerking out these phrases he was stumping up and down the tavern on his crutch, slapping tables with his hand, and giving such a show of excitement as would have convinced an Old Bailey judge or a Bow Street runner.My suspicions had been thoroughly reawakened on finding Black Dog at the Spy-glass, and I watched the cook narrowly.But he was too deep, and too ready, and too clever for me, and by the time the two men had come back out of breath and confessed that they had lost the track in a crowd, and been scolded like thieves, I would have gone bail for the innocence of Long John Silver."
"“好了，霍金斯，你看，”他说，“这件该死的事情落在了我这样的人头上，不是吗？船长特里劳尼——他怎么想？这个可恶的贼竟然坐在我的酒馆里，喝着我的朗姆酒！你到这儿来，把这事明明白白地告诉我。我却让他当着大家的面从我该死的眼皮底下溜了。现在，霍金斯，你要在船长面前替我说句公道话。你是个孩子，是的，但你像画一样聪明伶俐。你一进门，我就看出来了。好了，事情就是这样：我拄着这根老木头一瘸一拐能怎么样？我要还是当年那个水手长，一定能追上他，一定能，再把他打得屁滚尿流。可现在——”","“See here, now, Hawkins,” said he, “here’s a blessed hard thing on a man like me, now, ain’t it?There’s Cap’n Trelawney—what’s he to think?Here I have this confounded son of a Dutchman sitting in my own house drinking of my own rum!Here you comes and tells me of it plain; and here I let him give us all the slip before my blessed deadlights!Now, Hawkins, you do me justice with the cap’n.You’re a lad, you are, but you’re as smart as paint.I see that when you first come in.Now, here it is: What could I do, with this old timber I hobble on?When I was an A B master mariner I’d have come up alongside of him, hand over hand, and broached him to in a brace of old shakes, I would; but now—”"
"随后，他突然停住，张着下巴，像是想起了什么。","And then, all of a sudden, he stopped, and his jaw dropped as though he had remembered something."
"“酒钱！”他脱口而出。“三杯朗姆酒！哎呀，我如果忘了他该付酒钱，就该摔烂我的拐杖！接着他倒在椅子上笑了起来，笑得眼泪都顺着脸颊流乐下来。我也忍不住和他一起笑，一阵又一阵，直到整个酒店都笑声一片。","“The score!” he burst out.“Three goes o’ rum!Why, shiver my timbers, if I hadn’t forgotten my score!”And falling on a bench, he laughed until the tears ran down his cheeks.I could not help joining, and we laughed together, peal after peal, until the tavern rang again."
"“唉，我真是个珍贵的老海豹！”他最后说道，抹了抹脸颊。“我们会相处融洽的，霍金斯，因为我对海王发誓，我只配做船上的服务生。好了，现在过来吧，咱们准备走了。老在这儿也不是个事儿。公事公办，伙计。我这就去戴上我的旧帽子，跟你一起去见特里劳尼船长，向他报告这儿的事情。小霍金斯你要注意，这可是件严肃的大事。你和我谁也没有什么可以让我大胆说出来感到荣耀的事。你也没有，你说的。我们俩都不聪明。但是真见鬼！我的酒钱倒是个不错的笑话。”他又开始大笑起来，笑得如此发自内心，以至于虽然我并不觉得好笑，最终还是附和着笑了起来。","“Why, what a precious old sea-calf I am!” he said at last, wiping his cheeks.“You and me should get on well, Hawkins, for I’ll take my davy I should be rated ship’s boy.But come now, stand by to go about.This won’t do.Dooty is dooty, messmates.I’ll put on my old cockerel hat, and step along of you to Cap’n Trelawney, and report this here affair.For mind you, it’s serious, young Hawkins; and neither you nor me’s come out of it with what I should make so bold as to call credit.Nor you neither, says you; not smart—none of the pair of us smart.But dash my buttons!That was a good un about my score.”And he began to laugh again, and that so heartily, that though I did not see the joke as he did, I was again obliged to join him in his mirth."
"在我们沿着码头漫步的路上，西尔弗使自己成为了最有趣的一个同伴。他向我讲述着我们一路经过的各种船只、索具、吨位、国籍，还解释船上正在进行的工作——一艘船如何卸货，另一艘船如何装舱、另一艘正准备出海。他还不时地讲一些有关船或水手的小轶事，或者是反复地说一句海上的谚语，直到我完全学会为止。我开始意识到他可能是这儿最好的一个船友。","On our little walk along the quays, he made himself the most interesting companion, telling me about the different ships that we passed by, their rig, tonnage, and nationality, explaining the work that was going forward—how one was discharging, another taking in cargo, and a third making ready for sea—and every now and then telling me some little anecdote of ships or seamen or repeating a nautical phrase till I had learned it perfectly.I began to see that here was one of the best of possible shipmates."
"我们到达旅馆时，乡绅和利夫西医生正坐在一起，就着烤面包片刚喝完一夸脱啤酒，然后要到那艘纵帆船上去视察。","When we got to the inn, the squire and Dr. Livesey were seated together, finishing a quart of ale with a toast in it, before they should go aboard the schooner on a visit of inspection."
"高个子约翰情绪高涨地把事情从头到尾讲了出来，描述得准确无误。“好了，霍金斯，事情就是这样，对吗？”他不时地说，我总能证明他说的完全没错。","Long John told the story from first to last, with a great deal of spirit and the most perfect truth.“That was how it were, now, weren’t it, Hawkins?” he would say, now and again, and I could always bear him entirely out."
"两位先生都因为黑狗逃跑而感到遗憾，但我们也都认为这是没有办法的事。高个子约翰在受到一番夸奖后就拄着拐杖离开了。","The two gentlemen regretted that Black Dog had got away, but we all agreed there was nothing to be done, and after he had been complimented, Long John took up his crutch and departed."
"“所有人手都要在今天下午四点上船。”乡绅在他后面喊道。","“All hands aboard by four this afternoon,” shouted the squire after him."
"“是，是，先生。”厨师在走廊上大声应道。","“Aye, aye, sir,” cried the cook, in the passage."
"“好了，乡绅，”利夫西医生说，“大体上来说，我还是对你找的那些人不太信任，但我要说，约翰·西尔弗正合我意。”","“Well, squire,” said Dr. Livesey, “I don’t put much faith in your discoveries, as a general thing; but I will say this, John Silver suits me.”"
"“这个人绝对是个好人。”乡绅说道。","“The man’s a perfect trump,” declared the squire."
"“那现在，”医生补充道，“吉姆可以和我们一起上船吗？”","“And now,” added the doctor, “Jim may come on board with us, may he not?”"
"“当然可以。”乡绅说，“戴上你的帽子，霍金斯，我们去看看那艘船。”","“To be sure he may,” said squire.“Take your hat, Hawkins, and we’ll see the ship.”"
"第九章 火药和武器","Chapter 9 Powder and Arms "
"伊斯帕尼奥拉号停泊的地方离岸上有一段距离，我们的平底船在许多其他船的船头雕饰的下面和船尾间穿梭。它们的缆绳有时擦着我们的船底，有时在我们头顶上摇晃。我们最后终于到了船边。船上的大副阿罗先生在船上迎接我们并向我们致敬。他是个棕色皮肤的老水手，戴着耳环，还患有斜视。他和乡绅关系非常亲密友好，但是我很快发现特里劳尼先生和船长之间的关系就不是那么回事了。","The hispaniola lay some way out, and we went under the figureheads and round the sterns of many other ships, and their cables sometimes grated underneath our keel, and sometimes swung above us.At last, however, we got alongside, and were met and saluted as we stepped aboard by the mate, Mr. Arrow, a brown old sailor with earrings in his ears and a squint.He and the squire were very thick and friendly, but I soon observed that things were not the same between Mr. Trelawney and the captain."
"船长是个一脸严肃的人，看上去对船上的一切事情都很恼怒，并且他很快就将告诉我们原因：我们刚一下进船舱，就有一名水手跟了进来。","This last was a sharp-looking man who seemed angry with everything on board and was soon to tell us why, for we had hardly got down into the cabin when a sailor followed us."
"“先生，斯莫利特船长有话要和您说。”他说。","“Captain Smollett, sir, axing to speak with you,” said he."
"“我随时听候船长的命令。请他进来吧。”乡绅说。","“I am always at the captain’s orders.Show him in,” said the squire."
"紧跟在送信人后面的船长立刻走了进来，并关上了身后的舱门。","The captain, who was close behind his messenger, entered at once and shut the door behind him."
"“好了，斯莫利特船长，你有什么要说的？我希望一切顺利，一切都井然有序，可以出海了。”","“Well, Captain Smollett, what have you to say?All well, I hope; all shipshape and seaworthy?”"
"“噢，先生，”船长说，“我认为我最好还是直说了吧，即使有可能会冒犯您。我不喜欢这次航行，我不喜欢这些人，我不喜欢我的大副。我的话就这些，简单明了。”","“Well, sir,” said the captain, “better speak plain, I believe, even at the risk of offence.I don’t like this cruise; I don’t like the men; and I don’t like my officer.That’s short and sweet.”"
"“也许你是不喜欢这艘船吧？”乡绅问道，我看得出来他很生气。","“Perhaps, sir, you don’t like the ship?” inquired the squire, very angry, as I could see."
"“先生，没见她试航，我对此还不能说什么，”船长说道，“她似乎是一艘精巧的船，再多我就说不上了。”","“I can’t speak as to that, sir, not having seen her tried,” said the captain.“She seems a clever craft; more I can’t say.”"
"“先生，也许你是不喜欢你的雇主吧？”乡绅说。","“Possibly, sir, you may not like your employer, either?” said the squire."
"但这时，利夫西医生插话进来。","But here Dr. Livesey cut in."
"“等一会儿，”他说，“等一会儿。这样的问题除了伤了彼此和气，没有任何用处。船长要么说得太多了，要么说得太少了，我想请他把他说过的话解释一下。你说你不喜欢这次航行。那么为什么呢？”","“Stay a bit,” said he, “stay a bit.No use of such questions as that but to produce ill feeling.The captain has said too much or he has said too little, and I’m bound to say that I require an explanation of his words.You don’t, you say, like this cruise. Now, why?”"
"“先生，我是在我们所谓的保密条件下受聘，将这艘船开到那位先生叫我去的地方，”船长说道，“迄今为止一切顺利。但现在，我发现船上每个人知道的都比我多。我觉得这不公平，你说呢？”","“I was engaged, sir, on what we call sealed orders, to sail this ship for that gentleman where he should bid me,” said the captain.“So far so good.But now I find that every man before the mast knows more than I do.I don’t call that fair, now, do you?”"
"“是的，”利夫西医生说，“我也认为不公平。”","“No,” said Dr. Livesey, “I don’t.”"
"“再说，”船长说，“我了解到我们要去寻宝——注意，我是从手下人的嘴里听到的。现在，寻宝是一件棘手的活儿。我绝对不喜欢寻宝航行。我不喜欢财宝，尤其是当它们还是秘密时——当（请求您的原谅，特里劳尼先生）这个秘密连鹦鹉都知道了。”","“Next,” said the captain, “I learn we are going after treasure—hear it from my own hands, mind you.Now, treasure is ticklish work; I don’t like treasure voyages on any account, and I don’t like them, above all, when they are secret and when (begging your pardon, Mr. Trelawney) the secret has been told to the parrot.”"
"“西尔弗的鹦鹉吗？”乡绅问。","“Silver’s parrot?”  asked the squire."
"“这不过是种说法，”船长说，“我是说泄密。我相信你们两位先生都不知道自己将面临什么，但我要告诉你们我的看法——那就是生死一线间。”“一切都非常清楚，我敢说是千真万确，”利夫西医生答道，“我们要去冒险，但是我们并不像你想的那样无知。而且你还说你不喜欢船员。难道他们不是好水手吗？”","“It’s a way of speaking,” said the captain.“Blabbed, I mean.It’s my belief neither of you gentlemen know what you are about, but I’ll tell you my way of it—life or death, and a close run.”“That is all clear, and, I dare say, true enough,” replied Dr. Livesey.“We take the risk, but we are not so ignorant as you believe us.Next, you say you don’t like the crew.Are they not good seamen?”"
"“我不喜欢他们，先生。”斯莫利特船长回答说。“我认为当初应该由我来挑选手下人，如果你说到这点的话。”","“I don’t like them, sir,” returned Captain Smollett.“And I think I should have had the choosing of my own hands, if you go to that.”"
"“也许是该由你来挑选。”医生回答。“我的朋友也许本该带你一块儿挑选。但是即使这件事考虑不周，那也不是故意的。还有，你不喜欢阿罗吗？”","“Perhaps you should,” replied the doctor.“My friend should, perhaps, have taken you along with him; but the slight, if there be one, was unintentional.And you don’t like Mr. Arrow?”"
"“先生，我不喜欢他。我相信他是个好水手，但他对手下人太放任，当不了一个好大副。一个大副应该严于律己——不应该和桅杆前的手下人一起喝酒！”","“I don’t, sir.I believe he’s a good seaman, but he’s too free with the crew to be a good officer.A mate should keep himself to himself—shouldn’t drink with the men before the mast!”"
"“你是说他酗酒？”乡绅叫道。","“Do you mean he drinks?” cried the squire."
"“不，先生，”船长答道，“只是他太随便了。”","“No, sir,” replied the captain, “only that he’s too familiar.”"
"“好了，总之就是这样，船长？”医生问，“告诉我们你想怎么做。”","“Well, now, and the short and long of it, captain?” asked the doctor.“Tell us what you want.”"
"“那么，先生们，你们是下定决心要进行这次航行了吗？”","“Well, gentlemen, are you determined to go on this cruise?”"
"“铁了心。”乡绅回答。","“Like iron,” answered the squire."
"“很好。”船长说。“那么，既然你们已经非常耐心地听我说了这些我无法证实的事，那就再听我多说几句。他们正在往前舱里放火药和武器。现在你们在仓下有个好地方，为什么不把它们放在那儿呢？——这是第一点。另外，你带着四个你们自己的人，他们告诉我其中的一些人要睡在前舱。为什么不让他们睡在尾舱边上呢？——这是第二点。”","“Very good,” said the captain.“Then, as you’ve heard me very patiently, saying things that I could not prove, hear me a few words more.They are putting the powder and the arms in the fore hold.Now, you have a good place under the cabin; why not put them there?—first point.Then, you are bringing four of your own people with you, and they tell me some of them are to be berthed forward.Why not give them the berths here beside the cabin? —second point.”"
"“还有吗？”特里劳尼先生问。","“Any more?” asked Mr. Trelawney."
"“还有一点。”船长说，“事情已经泄露得太多了。”","“One more,” said the captain.“There’s been too much blabbing already.”"
"“太多太多了。”医生也同意。","“Far too much,” agreed the doctor."
"“我要把我听到的都告诉你们，”斯莫利特船长继续说，“你们有一张某个岛屿的地图，上面面用十字符标出了宝藏的地方，而且这岛屿位于——”接着，他把岛屿的经纬度都准确地说出来了。","“I’ll tell you what I’ve heard myself,” continued Captain Smollett: “that you have a map of an island, that there’s crosses on the map to show where treasure is, and that the island lies—”And then he named the latitude and longitude exactly."
"“我从来没有跟人说过！”乡绅叫喊起来。","“I never told that,” cried the squire, “to a soul!”"
"“先生，水手们都知道了。”船长回应道。","“The hands know it, sir,” returned the captain."
"“利夫西，那一定是你或者霍金斯。”乡绅大声说道。","“Livesey, that must have been you or Hawkins,” cried the squire."
"“是谁泄的密没有多大意义。”医生答道。我能看出他和船长对特里劳尼先生的申辩都没有太重视。","“It doesn’t much matter who it was,” replied the doctor.And I could see that neither he nor the captain paid much regard to Mr. Trelawney's protestations."
"我也一样。的确，特里劳尼先生嘴很松。但这次我相信他说的真是实情，我们谁都没说过岛屿的位置。","Neither did I, to be sure, he was so loose a talker; yet in this case I believe he was really right and that nobody had told the situation of the island."
"“好了，先生们，”船长继续说，“我不知道谁有这幅地图，但是我想指出的是，甚至对我和阿罗先生都要保密，否则我就请你们允许我辞职。”","“Well, gentlemen,” continued the captain, “I don’t know who has this map; but I make it a point, it shall be kept secret even from me and Mr. Arrow.Otherwise I would ask you to let me resign.”"
"“我明白，”医生说，“你希望我们暗中行事，并且把船上所有的武器弹药放在尾舱，让我朋友自己的人看护，拥有船上的全部武器和火药。换句话说，你是担心叛乱。”","“I see,” said the doctor.“You wish us to keep this matter dark and to make a garrison of the stern part of the ship, manned with my friend’s own people, and provided with all the arms and powder on board.In other words, you fear a mutiny.”"
"“先生，”斯莫利特船长说，“我不是有意冒犯，但我认为你没有权利将这些话强加给我。先生，如果哪位船长有足够的根据说出你刚才那些话，那他就不会有理由出海了。至于阿罗先生，我相信他为人绝对诚实。水手中的一些人也一样，据我所知所有水手可能都为人诚实。但是我要对这艘船的安全和船上每条生命负责。我认为，我看到的事情有点儿不对劲。于是，我要求你们采取某些防范措施，或者是让我辞职。我要说的就这些。”","“Sir,” said Captain Smollett, “with no intention to take offence, I deny your right to put words into my mouth.No captain, sir, would be justified in going to sea at all if he had ground enough to say that.As for Mr. Arrow, I believe him thoroughly honest; some of the men are the same; all may be for what I know.But I am responsible for the ship’s safety and the life of every man Jack aboard of her.I see things going, as I think, not quite right.And I ask you to take certain precautions or let me resign my berth.And that’s all.”"
"“斯莫利特船长，”医生带着微笑开口说，“你听说过大山和小老鼠的寓言吗？我敢说你会原谅我，但你的话使我想起了那则寓言。我敢打赌，你刚进来时一定是做好了某种打算的。”","“Captain Smollett,” began the doctor with a smile, “did ever you hear the fable of the mountain and the mouse? You’ll excuse me, I dare say, but you remind me of that fable.When you came in here, I’ll stake my wig, you meant more than this.”"
"“医生，”船长说，“你很聪明。我进来时是想被解职的。我认为特里劳尼先生不会听进去一个字。”","“Doctor,” said the captain, “you are smart.When I came in here I meant to get discharged.I had no thought that Mr. Trelawney would hear a word.”"
"“我不想听你再唠叨。”乡绅喊道，“要不是利夫西在这儿，我早就让你见鬼去了。事实上，我已经听完了你的话。我会按照你的想法去做，但我会对你印象更差。”","“No more I would,” cried the squire.“Had Livesey not been here I should have seen you to the deuce.As it is, I have heard you.I will do as you desire, but I think the worse of you.”"
"“随你便，先生。”船长说，“你会发现我是尽职尽责的。”","“That’s as you please, sir,” said the captain.“You’ll find I do my duty.”"
"说完，船长就走了。","And with that he took his leave."
"“特里劳尼，”医生说，“虽然和我的所有想法都相反，但我相信你已经设法找到了两个诚实的人到船上和你在一起——那个人和约翰·西尔弗。”","“Trelawney,” said the doctor, “contrary to all my notions, I believed you have managed to get two honest men on board with you—that man and John Silver.”"
"“西尔弗还好，”乡绅说道，“但是至于那个心胸狭窄的骗子，我断言他的所作所为没有男子汉气概，没有水手气魄，也完全不像英国人。”","“Silver, if you like,” cried the squire; “but as for that intolerable humbug, I declare I think his conduct unmanly, unsailorly, and downright un-English.”"
"“好了，”医生说，“我们走着瞧。”","“Well,” said the doctor, “we shall see.”"
"我们走上甲板时，水手们已经喊着哟——嗬——嘿的号子在往外搬武器弹药了，船长和阿罗先生站在一边监督着。","When we came on deck, the men had begun already to take out the arms and powder, yo-ho-ing at their work, while the captain and Mr. Arrow stood by superintending."
"新的安排很合我意。整艘纵帆船都已经翻修过了。六个铺位从中舱后部移到了尾舱，这套船舱仅由左舷的一条用圆木搭建的通道与厨房和前甲板下的水手仓相连。这六个床铺本来是为船长、阿罗先生、亨特、乔伊斯、医生和乡绅安排的。现在我和雷德鲁斯占了其中两个，阿罗先生和船长将睡在舷梯上的甲板上。那个地方的两侧已经加宽，你差不多可以叫它圆形甲板室。当然，它还是很低，但挂两个吊床的地方还是有的，连大副也看起来对这个安排很满意。也许，连他也对船员们有疑心，但那只是猜想。就像你将听到的，我们对他的看法不久就得到了回应。","The new arrangement was quite to my liking.The whole schooner had been overhauled; six berths had been made astern out of what had been the after-part of the main hold; and this set of cabins was only joined to the galley and forecastle by a sparred passage on the port side.It had been originally meant that the captain, Mr. Arrow, Hunter, Joyce, the doctor, and the squire were to occupy these six berths.Now Redruth and I were to get two of them and Mr. Arrow and the captain were to sleep on deck in the companion, which had been enlarged on each side till you might almost have called it a round house.Very low it was still, of course; but there was room to swing two hammocks, and even the mate seemed pleased with the arrangement.Even he, perhaps, had been doubtful as to the crew, but that is only guess, for as you shall hear, we had not long the benefit of his opinion."
"我们都努力地工作着，搬弹药和床位，这时高个子约翰和最后一两个水手从岸边来的小船上下来。","We were all hard at work, changing the powder and the berths, when the last man or two, and Long John along with them, came off in a shore-boat."
"厨师像猴子一样敏捷地上来，一看到我们正在做的事情，就说“嗬，伙计们！”","The cook came up the side like a monkey for cleverness, and as soon as he saw what was doing, “So ho, mates!” says he."
"“这是怎么回事？”","“What’s this?”"
"“我们正在搬运火药，水手。”一个人回答。","“We’re a changing of the powder, Jack,” answered one."
"“哎呀，火药，”高个子约翰叫起来，“如果我们这样做，就赶不上早潮了！”","“Why, by the powers,” cried Long John, “if we do, we’ll miss the morning tide!”"
"“这是我的命令！”船长简略地说，“我的伙计，你可以下去了。水手们要吃晚饭了。”","“My orders!” said the captain shortly.“You may go below, my man.Hands will want supper.”"
"“是，是，先生。”厨师应道，他摸了摸自己的前额，立刻消失在他厨房的那个方向。","“Aye, aye, sir,” answered the cook, and touching his forelock, he disappeared at once in the direction of his galley."
"“船长，那可是个好人。”医生说。","“That’s a good man, captain,” said the doctor."
"“很可能是吧，先生。”斯莫利特船长应道。“伙计，别急，慢慢来。”他接着冲着那些搬运火药的家伙说。然后，他突然看到我在打量搬到船中部的那座长长的铜制的旋转炮，便叫道：“喂，你这个服务生，离开那儿！到厨师那找点事情做。”","“Very likely, sir,” replied Captain Smollett.“Easy with that, men-easy,” he ran on, to the fellows who were shifting the powder; and then suddenly observing me examining the swivel we carried amidships, a long brass nine, “Here you, ship’s boy,” he cried, “out o’ that!Off with you to the cook and get some work.”"
"于是我赶紧跑开了，并听到他特别大声地对医生说：“我的船上绝不要宠臣。”","And then as I was hurrying off I heard him say, quite loudly, to the doctor, “I'll have no favourites on my ship.”"
"我向你保证，我对船长的看法和乡绅的完全一样，对他深恶痛绝。","I assure you I was quite of the squire’s way of thinking, and hated the captain deeply."
"第十章 航行","Chapter 10 The Voyage "
"那天晚上，我们为把东西归位装好忙了一整夜。乡绅的朋友们，像布兰德里先生等等，来了一拨又一拨，为他送行，祝他旅途愉快，平安返航。我在“本博将军”旅店一晚上干的活，从来没有这个晚上的一半多。快到黎明的时候，水手长吹响了他的哨子，水手们开始站在绞盘杆前各就各位，而我已经累到不行了。我已经感到加倍的疲劳了，但我还是不愿离开甲板。对我来说一切都是那么的新鲜而有趣——简短的命令，尖利的哨声，水手们在闪烁的船灯下忙忙碌碌地走向各自的岗位。","All that night we were in a great bustle getting things stowed in their place, and boatfuls of the squire’s friends, Mr. Blandly and the like, coming off to wish him a good voyage and a safe return.We never had a night at the Admiral Benbow when I had half the work; and I was dog-tired when, a little before dawn, the boatswain sounded his pipe and the crew began to man the capstan-bars.I might have been twice as weary, yet I would not have left the deck, all was so new and interesting to me—the brief commands, the shrill note of the whistle, the men bustling to their places in the glimmer of the ship’s lanterns."
"“现在，老伙计，给我们唱支歌。”一个声音喊道。","“Now, Barbecue, tip us a stave,” cried one voice."
"“唱支老歌。”另一个人喊着。","“The old one,” cried another."
"“是，是，伙计们。”腋下拄着拐杖站在一旁的高个子约翰说道。然后，那首我非常熟悉的曲子立刻响了起来：“十五个人站在聚魂棺上——”","“Aye, aye, mates,” said Long John, who was standing by, with his crutch under his arm, and at once broke out in the air and words I knew so well: “Fifteen men on the dead man’s chest—”"
"接着，全体水手齐声合唱：“呦——嗬——嗬，还有一瓶朗姆酒！”","And then the whole crew bore chorus:— “Yo—ho—ho, and a bottle of rum!”"
"在唱到第三个“嗬！”时，大家都齐心协力地推着前面的绞盘杆。","And at the third “Ho!” drove the bars before them with a will."
"即使在这激动人心的时刻，这首曲子还是立刻将我带回到了“本博将军”旅店，我仿佛在这合唱声中听到了老船长的声音。不过，很快就起锚了。铁锚很快吊到船头滴起了水，船帆也很快开始鼓起，两边的陆地和船只飞掠而过。还没等我趁机躺下睡一个小时，伊斯帕尼奥拉号就已经开始了向金银岛的航行。","Even at that exciting moment it carried me back to the old Admiral Benbow in a second, and I seemed to hear the voice of the captain piping in the chorus.But soon the anchor was short up; soon it was hanging dripping at the bows; soon the sails began to draw, and the land and shipping to flit by on either side; and before I could lie down to snatch an hour of slumber the HISPANIOLA had begun her voyage to the Isle of Treasure."
"我不打算详细描述这次旅行。那可以说是一帆风顺。事实证明，船性能很好，水手们身手不凡，船长完全对他的工作得心应手。但在我们最终到达金银岛之前发生了两三件事情，需要让大家知道。","I am not going to relate that voyage in detail.It was fairly prosperous.The ship proved to be a good ship, the crew were capable seamen, and the captain thoroughly understood his business.But before we came the length of Treasure Island, two or three things had happened which require to be known."
"首先是阿罗先生，他甚至比船长原来担心的还要糟糕。他根本管不住手下人，他们在他面前想干什么就干什么。但这还不是最糟的，因为开船一两天后，他开始醉眼朦胧地出现在甲板上，面颊通红，舌头打绊，还有其他醉态。他一次次地丢人，被命令回到船舱下面，很是难堪。他有时跌倒、划伤自己，有时整天躺在舱梯一边的那张小床上，有时他会清醒一两天，勉强做他那份工作。","Mr. Arrow, first of all, turned out even worse than the captain had feared.He had no command among the men, and people did what they pleased with him.But that was by no means the worst of it, for after a day or two at sea he began to appear on deck with hazy eye, red cheeks, stuttering tongue, and other marks of drunkenness.Time after time he was ordered below in disgrace.Sometimes he fell and cut himself; sometimes he lay all day long in his little bunk at one side of the companion; sometimes for a day or two he would be almost sober and attend to his work at least passably."
"同时，我们谁也无法弄清他是从哪里搞来的酒。这成了船上的谜。尽管我们随时监视他，可始终解不开这个谜。要是我们在他喝醉的时候当面问他酒是从哪来的，他只是哈哈一笑；要是我们在他清醒的时候问他，他就会严肃地矢口否认他除了水还喝了别的任何东西。","In the meantime, we could never make out where he got the drink.That was the ship’s mystery.Watch him as we pleased, we could do nothing to solve it; and when we asked him to his face, he would only laugh if he were drunk, and if he were sober deny solemnly that he ever tasted anything but water."
"他不仅是一个无能的军官，还在水手中起着坏影响，而且很明显，照这样下去，他一定会彻底毁灭自己。所以，当他在一个黑夜彻底消失在迎头的浪中、再也没有出现的时候，没有人感到太吃惊，也没有人感到非常难过。","He was not only useless as an officer and a bad influence amongst the men, but it was plain that at this rate he must soon kill himself outright, so nobody was much surprised, nor very sorry, when one dark night, with a head sea, he disappeared entirely and was seen no more."
"“失足落水！”船长说。“好了，先生们，这样省得我们把他铐起来了。”","“Overboard!” said the captain.“Well, gentlemen, that saves the trouble of putting him in irons.”"
"但因为我们没有了大副，所以当然有必要从水手中提拔一名。水手长乔布·安德森是船上最合适的人选，尽管他仍被称作水手长，但他担负起了大副的职责。特里劳尼先生以前曾出过海，他的航海知识使他大有用武之地，因为他经常在天气温和时亲自当班瞭望。舵手伊斯雷尔·汉兹则是个小心谨慎、深谋远虑、经验丰富的老水手，紧急关头几乎可以将所有事情托付给他。","But there we were, without a mate; and it was necessary, of course, to advance one of the men.The boatswain, Job Anderson, was the likeliest man aboard, and though he kept his old title, he served in a way as mate.Mr. Trelawney had followed the sea, and his knowledge made him very useful, for he often took a watch himself in easy weather.And the coxswain, Israel Hands, was a careful, wily, old, experienced seaman who could be trusted at a pinch with almost anything."
"他是高个子约翰·西尔弗的一大心腹。提到他，我不由得接着想说我们船上的厨师，那些人叫他烧烤架。","He was a great confidant of Long John Silver, and so the mention of his name leads me on to speak of our ship’s cook, Barbecue, as the men called him."
"在船上，他用一根断绳子套在脖子上带着拐杖，使两只手尽可能行动自如。看着他把拐杖脚放在舱壁的缝里靠在上面，随着船的每次起伏像稳稳当当在岸上的人一样继续烧菜做饭，确实是一景。更令人奇怪的是，你能看到他在最恶劣的天气穿过甲板。他有一两根绳子帮助他跨过甲板最宽的地段，被称作“高个子约翰的耳环”。他时而用拐杖从一处移到另一处，时而拉着绳索到船舷一侧，快得像正常人走路一样。然而，过去跟他一起出海的一些人还惋惜地说他身手大不如前了。","Aboard ship he carried his crutch by a lanyard round his neck, to have both hands as free as possible.It was something to see him wedge the foot of the crutch against a bulkhead, and propped against it, yielding to every movement of the ship, get on with his cooking like someone safe ashore.Still more strange was it to see him in the heaviest of weather cross the deck.He had a line or two rigged up to help him across the widest spaces—Long John’s earrings, they were called; and he would hand himself from one place to another, now using the crutch, now trailing it alongside by the lanyard, as quickly as another man could walk.Yet some of the men who had sailed with him before expressed their pity to see him so reduced."
"“烧烤架不是个等闲之辈。”舵手对我说，“他小时候受过良好的教育，只要他乐意，他说起话来可以引经据典，而且非常勇敢——狮子跟高个子约翰相比也算不了什么！我曾见他一个人和四个人打架——他赤手空拳。”","“He’s no common man, Barbecue,” said the coxswain to me.“He had good schooling in his young days and can speak like a book when so minded; and brave—a lion’s nothing alongside of Long John!I seen him grapple four and knock their heads together—him unarmed.”"
"所有的水手都尊重他，甚至对他唯命是从。他对每个人采取不同的方式说话，对每个人都给予特殊关照。他对我和蔼可亲，从不厌烦。每次在厨房里看到我，他总是非常高兴。他把厨房收拾得非常干净，把盘碟擦干净挂起来，并把他的鹦鹉关在笼子里放在角落。","All the crew respected and even obeyed him.He had a way of talking to each and doing everybody some particular service.To me he was unweariedly kind, and always glad to see me in the galley, which he kept as clean as a new pin, the dishes hanging up burnished and his parrot in a cage in one corner."
"“霍金斯，快过来，”他会说，“来听约翰讲故事。没有人比你更受欢迎了，我的孩子。坐下来，听听新闻。这是弗林特船长——我管我的鹦鹉叫弗林特船长，跟那个有名的海盗一个姓——弗林特船长正在预言我们的航行成功。对吗，船长？”","“Come away, Hawkins,” he would say; “come and have a yarn with John.Nobody more welcome than yourself, my son.Sit you down and hear the news.Here’s Cap’n Flint—I calls my parrot Cap’n Flint, after the famous buccaneer—here’s Cap’n Flint predicting success to our v’yage.Wasn’t you, cap’n?”"
"那只鹦鹉就会急促地说：“八里亚尔！八里亚尔！八里亚尔！”","And the parrot would say, with great rapidity, “Pieces of eight!Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight!”"
"直到你为它没有喘不过气来而感到惊讶，直到约翰用手帕扔过去盖住鸟笼为止。“听着，那只鸟，”他总是说，“可能两百岁了，霍金斯——它们通常很长寿。如果有什么人比它们看到过更多的邪恶，那一定是魔鬼自己。它曾与英格兰航行——伟大的英格兰船长、那个海盗。它曾到过马达加斯加、马拉巴尔海岸、苏里南、普罗维登斯和波多贝罗。打捞那艘沉没的装甲船时它也在场。它就是在那儿学会说‘八里亚尔’的，这不奇怪。三十五万呀，霍金斯！印度总督号在果阿港外被劫的时候它也在场。你看到它时会认为它是只雏鸟。但是你闻过火药味——对吗，船长？”"," Till you wondered that it was not out of breath, or till John threw his handkerchief over the cage.“Now, that bird,” he would say, “is, maybe, two hundred years old, Hawkins—they live forever mostly; and if anybody’s seen more wickedness, it must be the devil himself.She’s sailed with England, the great Cap’n England, the pirate.She’s been at Madagascar, and at Malabar, and Surinam, and Providence, and Portobello.She was at the fishing up of the wrecked plate ships.It’s there she learned ‘Pieces of eight,’ and little wonder; three hundred and fifty thousand of ‘em, Hawkins!She was at the boarding of the viceroy of the Indies out of Goa, she was; and to look at her you would think she was a baby.But you smelt powder—didn’t you, cap’n?”"
"“准备行动。”鹦鹉会尖叫。","“Stand by to go about,” the parrot would scream."
"“啊，它真是个尤物。”厨师总会说，然后从他的口袋里掏出糖块来喂它。然后这只鸟就会啄笼子上的栅栏，一直咒骂个不停，说出邪恶的话语来。“你看，”约翰会补充道，“小伙子，近朱者赤，近墨者黑。我这只可怜无辜的小鸟骂人骂得炉火纯青，没有人比它更聪明，你要知道这一点。它会用同样的方式在牧师面前咒骂。”约翰会虔诚地摸一下自己的前额行举手礼，这使我认为他是船员中最好的人。","“Ah, she’s a handsome craft, she is,” the cook would say, and give her sugar from his pocket, and then the bird would peck at the bars and swear straight on, passing belief for wickedness.“There,” John would add, “you can’t touch pitch and not be mucked, lad.Here’s this poor old innocent bird o’ mine swearing blue fire, and none the wiser, you may lay to that.She would swear the same, in a manner of speaking, before chaplain.”And John would touch his forelock with a solemn way he had that made me think he was the best of men."
"在这期间，乡绅和斯莫利特船长相互之间还是那么生分。乡绅对这件事毫不顾忌，他就是看不起船长。而船长这边从来不先开口，等对方问他时，他只是用简短、尖锐、干巴巴的话回应一下，不浪费一个字。实在被逼到墙角了，他就把原因归咎于自己错怪了水手。他说，所有的水手的确像他所希望的那样精神饱满，所有的水手都表现不错。至于船，他已经彻底被她迷住了。“先生，她一定会完成使命，甚至超过一个男人能从妻子那儿有权得到的一切。但是，”他总会补充说，“我要说的是我们尚未完成这次旅行，而且我不喜欢这次航行。”","In the meantime, the squire and Captain Smollett were still on pretty distant terms with one another.The squire made no bones about the matter; he despised the captain.The captain, on his part, never spoke but when he was spoken to, and then sharp and short and dry, and not a word wasted.He owned, when driven into a corner, that he seemed to have been wrong about the crew, that some of them were as brisk as he wanted to see and all had behaved fairly well.As for the ship, he had taken a downright fancy to her.“She’ll lie a point nearer the wind than a man has a right to expect of his own married wife, sir.But,” he would add, “all I say is, we’re not home again, and I don’t like the cruise.”"
"听到这话，乡绅就会转过去，高扬着下巴，在甲板上来回踱步。","The squire, at this, would turn away and march up and down the deck, chin in air."
"“那个人要是再起争端，”他常说，“我就非翻脸不可。”","“A trifle more of that man,” he would say, “and I shall explode.”"
"我们经历了一些非常糟糕的天气，这只不过证明了伊斯帕尼奥拉号的性能有多好。船上的每个人都非常满意，否则他们就是一些无法满足的人了。因为我相信自从诺亚方舟下海以来，还没有哪艘船上的水手能过这样受宠的日子。只要稍有借口就可以把兑水的烈酒喝个痛快；遇到什么不同寻常的日子，比如说乡绅听说哪天是某人的生日，还会有水果布丁。甲板中部上还摆了一桶苹果，谁想吃谁就自己拿。","We had some heavy weather, which only proved the qualities of the HISPANIOLA.Every man on board seemed well content, and they must have been hard to please if they had been otherwise, for it is my belief there was never a ship’s company so spoiled since Noah put to sea.Double grog was going on the least excuse; there was duff on odd days, as, for instance, if the squire heard it was any man’s birthday, and always a barrel of apples standing broached in the waist for anyone to help himself that had a fancy."
"“我从来不知道这样做有什么好。”船长对利夫西医生说，“放纵手下人，招来罪恶。这是我的信条。”","“Never knew good come of it yet,” the captain said to Dr. Livesey.“Spoil forecastle hands, make devils.That’s my belief.”"
"但苹果桶确实带来了好处，就像你将要听到的，因为要不是它，我们就不会有任何防备，也许已经葬送在叛徒手里了。","But good did come of the apple barrel, as you shall hear, for if it had not been for that, we should have had no note of warning and might all have perished by the hand of treachery."
"事情的经过是这样的。","This was how it came about."
"我们追上了信风，以便乘风抵达我们要找的那个岛屿——我不能说得更直白了——而我们现在正驶向它，日夜都有一个眼力好的人加强瞭望。满打满算，那天该是我们往程的最后一天了。当晚某个时辰或者最迟第二天中午之前，应该就能看到金银岛了。我们正向南偏西南方向行驶，一阵阵微风从船侧吹来。伊斯帕尼奥拉号在海浪轻轻拍击下向前平稳行驶，船头的斜桅杆不时会溅上阵阵浪花。所有的帆都鼓满了风，每个人也都精神抖擞，因为我们探险的第一阶段眼看就要结束了。","We had run up the trades to get the wind of the island we were after—I am not allowed to be more plain—and now we were running down for it with a bright lookout day and night.It was about the last day of our outward voyage by the largest computation; some time that night, or at latest before noon of the morrow, we should sight the Treasure Island.We were heading S.S.W. and had a steady breeze abeam and a quiet sea.The HISPANIOLA rolled steadily, dipping her bowsprit now and then with a whiff of spray.All was drawing alow and aloft; everyone was in the bravest spirits because we were now so near an end of the first part of our adventure."
"此时，太阳刚刚落山，我干完了所有的活儿，正向自己的铺位走去。突然，我产生了想吃苹果的念头。我在甲板上跑起来。望风人正全神贯注地盯着前方，监视着岛屿。舵手一边见风使舵，一边轻轻地吹着口哨。那是除了海水拍打船头和船四周的沙沙声外唯一的声音。","Now, just after sundown, when all my work was over and I was on my way to my berth, it occurred to me that I should like an apple.I ran on deck.The watch was all forward looking out for the island.The man at the helm was watching the luff of the sail and whistling away gently to himself, and that was the only sound excepting the swish of the sea against the bows and around the sides of the ship."
"我整个身体钻进了苹果桶，发现里面连一个苹果都没有了。但是坐在黑暗里听着海浪声、随着轮船得晃动，我有些似睡非睡。这时突然有个很沉的人扑通一声在苹果桶边坐了下来。他把肩膀靠在上面时，苹果桶晃了一下。我正要跳起来，突然听到那人说起话来。这是西尔弗的声音，没等我听到十几句话，我就说什么也不敢暴露自己了。我只是躺在那儿，一边发抖一边听着，恐惧好奇到了极点，因为从这十几句话里，我已经明白船上所有老实人的性命都靠我一个人了。","In I got bodily into the apple barrel, and found there was scarce an apple left; but sitting down there in the dark, what with the sound of the waters and the rocking movement of the ship, I had either fallen asleep or was on the point of doing so when a heavy man sat down with rather a clash close by.The barrel shook as he leaned his shoulders against it, and I was just about to jump up when the man began to speak.It was Silver’s voice, and before I had heard a dozen words, I would not have shown myself for all the world, but lay there, trembling and listening, in the extreme of fear and curiosity, for from these dozen words I understood that the lives of all the honest men aboard depended upon me alone."
"第十一章 我在苹果桶里听到的","Chapter 11 What I Heard in the Apple Barrel "
"“不，不是我。”西尔弗说，“弗林特是船长；因为这只木腿，我只能负责掌舵。在一次弦炮攻击中，我丢了这条腿，而老皮尤则失去了双眼。那个医师技术很高，他给我截了肢。他是大学出来的，满口拉丁词，还懂很多其他的东西。但他像条狗一样地给人吊死了，在科尔索城堡，和其他人一样被晒干了。那是罗伯茨的手下。这都是因为他们给船改名字而惹出的事——叫什么“皇运”，或者别的名字。要照我说，一条船叫了什么名字，就不要再改了。“卡桑德”号就是这样的，因此，在英格兰船长占领了“印度总督”号之后，我们得以乘“卡桑德”号从马拉巴尔安全返航。老“瓦鲁斯”号也是这样，弗林特的那艘旧船，我眼看它被鲜血染红，还差一点被金子压沉。”","“No, not I,” said Silver.“Flint was cap’n; I was quartermaster, along of my timber leg.The same broadside I lost my leg, old Pew lost his deadlights.It was a master surgeon, him that ampytated me—out of college and all Latin by the bucket, and what not; but he was hanged like a dog, and sun-dried like the rest, at Corso Castle.That was Roberts’ men, that was, and comed of changing names to their ships—ROYAL FORTUNE and so on.Now, what a ship was christened, so let her stay, I says.So it was with the CASSANDRA, as brought us all safe home from Malabar, after England took the viceroy of the Indies; so it was with the old WALRUS, Flint’s old ship, as I’ve seen amuck with the red blood and fit to sink with gold.”"
"“啊！”另一个声音叫道，那是船上最年轻的帮手，语气中明显充满钦佩之情，“他可是人中豪杰呢，弗林特！”","“Ah!” cried another voice, that of the youngest hand on board, and evidently full of admiration.“He was the flower of the flock, was Flint!”"
"“据说，戴维斯也是条好汉。”西尔弗说，“我从没和他一起出过海。我先是跟英格兰一起，后来和弗林特，这就是我的经历。现在，我可以说是在一个人干了。我从英格兰那儿稳稳当当地攒下来九百镑，从弗林特那儿攒下两千。对于一个水手来说这已经不错啦。钱全都好好地存在银行里。现在光会赚钱已经不顶用了，要得会存钱，你要明白。如今英格兰的手下都在哪儿呢？我不知道。弗林特的手下呢？哎，大部分都在这条船上，有布丁吃就很高兴了。其中一些人之前还要讨饭呢。那瞎了眼的老皮尤，说起来真丢人，一年花掉一千两百磅，简直像个议会里的贵族。他现在在哪里呢？哦，他已经死了，到地底下去了。但是在那两年之前，真见鬼，他连饭都吃不上！他乞讨，偷东西，杀人，可是还是挨饿，老天！”","“Davis was a man too, by all accounts,” said Silver.“I never sailed along of him; first with England, then with Flint, that’s my story; and now here on my own account, in a manner of speaking.I laid by nine hundred safe, from England, and two thousand after Flint.That ain’t bad for a man before the mast—all safe in bank.‘Tain’t earning now, it’s saving does it, you may lay to that.Where’s all England’s men now?I dunno.Where’s Flint’s?Why, most on ‘em aboard here, and glad to get the duff—been begging before that, some on ‘em.Old Pew, as had lost his sight, and might have thought shame, spends twelve hundred pound in a year, like a lord in Parliament.Where is he now?Well, he’s dead now and under hatches; but for two year before that, shiver my timbers, the man was starving!He begged, and he stole, and he cut throats, and starved at that, by the powers!”"
"“嗯，毕竟，那些也没有什么用。”年轻的水手说道。","“Well, it ain’t much use, after all,” said the young seaman."
"“对傻瓜来说才没用，你要相信我的话——对他们来说，干什么都没用。”西尔弗叫道。“但是，现在，你听我说，你虽然年轻，却是聪明伶俐。我一见你就看出这一点了，因此我把你当成个男子汉来跟你说话。”","“‘Tain’t much use for fools, you may lay to it—that, nor nothing,” cried Silver.“But now, you look here: you’re young, you are, but you’re as smart as paint.I see that when I set my eyes on you, and I’ll talk to you like a man.”"
"你可以想象，当我听到这个可恶的老无赖把用在我身上的奉承话照搬到别人身上时，我是什么样的感觉。我想，要是我可以的话，一定会穿过木桶杀了他。此时，他仍在讲着，丝毫没有察觉到有人在偷听。","You may imagine how I felt when I heard this abominable old rogue addressing another in the very same words of flattery as he had used to myself.I think, if I had been able, that I would have killed him through the barrel.Meantime, he ran on, little supposing he was overheard."
"“那些靠运气吃饭的绅士们就是这样。他们生活艰苦，还冒着被绞死的危险，但是他们像斗鸡一样能吃能喝。一旦航行结束，哎，他们口袋里就不再是几百个硬币了，而是能有上百镑的钱。大部分钱他们都花在了朗姆酒和行乐之事上，然后，再身无分文地出海。但这不是我的风格。我把钱都存起来，这儿一些，那儿一点，哪里都不放太多，以免别人怀疑。你听着，我已经五十岁了。这次航行一结束，我就要正正经经地过绅士的日子了。时间还很充裕，真是胡扯。啊，但是我一直过得也很愉快，想要什么就买什么，睡得舒服，吃得可口，一直都是这样，除了是在海上。我是从什么时候开始的？从我做水手就开始了，就像你一样！”","“Here it is about gentlemen of fortune.They lives rough, and they risk swinging, but they eat and drink like fighting-cocks, and when a cruise is done, why, it’s hundreds of pounds instead of hundreds of farthings in their pockets.Now, the most goes for rum and a good fling, and to sea again in their shirts.But that’s not the course I lay.I puts it all away, some here, some there, and none too much anywheres, by reason of suspicion.I’m fifty, mark you; once back from this cruise, I set up gentleman in earnest.Time enough too, says you.Ah, but I’ve lived easy in the meantime, never denied myself o’ nothing heart desires, and slep’ soft and ate dainty all my days but when at sea.And how did I begin?Before the mast, like you!”"
"“但是，”另一位说，“其余的钱都不在原处了，不是吗？这次事成之后，你肯定不敢在布里斯托尔露面了。”","“Well,” said the other, “but all the other money’s gone now, ain’t it? You daren’t show face in Bristol after this.”"
"“哎，那你认为钱会在哪儿？”西尔弗嘲弄地问。","“Why, where might you suppose it was?” asked Silver derisively."
"“在布里斯托尔，在银行里，或是其他什么地方。”他的伙伴回答。","“At Bristol, in banks and places,” answered his companion."
"“曾经是在那里，”厨子说，“我们起锚的时候它是在那里。不过现在我老婆已经把钱都取出来啦。现在，“望远镜”酒店，连同租约、商誉和全部家当都卖了。而我老婆也离开那儿了，等着与我见面。我可以告诉你地点，我信得过你；但是这会在大伙中间引起妒忌。”","“It were,” said the cook; “it were when we weighed anchor.But my old missis has it all by now.And the Spy-glass is sold, lease and goodwill and rigging; and the old girl’s off to meet me.I would tell you where, for I trust you, but it’d make jealousy among the mates.”"
"“那你能信得过你老婆吗？”另一位问。","“And can you trust your missis?” asked the other."
"“那些靠运气吃饭的人，”厨子答道，“他们之间几乎毫无信用可言，的确如此，你要明白。但是我自有办法，真的。要是谁敢算计我——我是指熟人，那就跟我老约翰不是一个世界的人了。有些人害怕皮尤，有人怕弗林特，但是，弗林特他自己是怕我的。他怕，还很骄傲。弗林特的船员们是海上最粗暴的，连魔鬼都不敢和他们一同出海。我告诉你，我不是个爱说大话的家伙，你也亲眼看到，我和同伴相处得多么轻松。但是我做舵手时，是决不会用“绵羊”这个词来形容弗林特手下老海盗们的。啊，你在老约翰的船上大概也能亲自证实这一点。”","“Gentlemen of fortune,” returned the cook, “usually trusts little among themselves, and right they are, you may lay to it.But I have a way with me, I have.When a mate brings a slip on his cable—one as knows me, I mean—it won’t be in the same world with old John.There was some that was feared of Pew, and some that was feared of Flint; but Flint his own self was feared of me.Feared he was, and proud.They was the roughest crew afloat, was Flint’s; the devil himself would have been feared to go to sea with them.Well now, I tell you, I’m not a boasting man, and you seen yourself how easy I keep company, but when I was quartermaster, LAMBS wasn’t the word for Flint’s old buccaneers.Ah, you may be sure of yourself in old John’s ship.”"
"“那么，现在我告诉你，”小伙子说，“约翰，在和你这次谈话之前，我一点儿也不喜欢这工作，但是现在我改变主意了，我们一言为定。”","“Well, I tell you now,” replied the lad, “I didn’t half a quarter like the job till I had this talk with you, John; but there’s my hand on it now.”"
"“真是个勇敢的小伙子，又聪明。”西尔弗回答道，他热烈地握着手，连木桶都晃起来，“我还从来没见过像你这么好看的‘靠运气吃饭的绅士’呢。”","“And a brave lad you were, and smart too,” answered Silver, shaking hands so heartily that all the barrel shook, “and a finer figurehead for a gentleman of fortune I never clapped my eyes on.”"
"直到这时我才明白他们这些暗语的意思。所谓“靠运气吃饭的绅士”，指的仅仅是普通的海盗，我所偷听到的这短短一幕，是腐化一个最老实的人的最后行动，也许那是船上最后一个老实人了。但在这时，我松了一口气，因为西尔弗轻轻吹了一声口哨，又一个人溜达过来，跟他们坐在了一起。","By this time I had begun to understand the meaning of their terms.By a “gentleman of fortune”they plainly meant neither more nor less than a common pirate, and the little scene that I had overheard was the last act in the corruption of one of the honest hands—perhaps of the last one left aboard.But on this point I was soon to be relieved, for Silver giving a little whistle, a third man strolled up and sat down by the party."
"“迪克是我们的人了。”西尔弗说。","“Dick’s square,” said Silver."
"“哦，我就知道迪克会加入我们。”那是舵手伊斯雷尔·汉兹的声音，“他不是傻瓜，迪克不是。”说着他转了转嘴里的烟草块，吐了口唾沫。“但是，听我说，”他接着说，“我想知道，‘大叉烧’，我们还要在这破船上呆多久？我已经受够了斯莫利特船长，他已经为难我很久了，那个遭雷劈的家伙！我想要进那个特舱，真的。我想要他们的腌菜和酒，还有其他的东西。”","“Oh, I know’d Dick was square,” returned the voice of the coxswain, Israel Hands.“He’s no fool, is Dick.”And he turned his quid and spat.“But look here,” he went on, “here’s what I want to know, Barbecue: how long are we a going to stand off and on like a blessed bumboat?I’ve had a’most enough o’ Cap’n Smollett; he’s hazed me long enough, by thunder!I want to go into that cabin, I do.I want their pickles and wines, and that.”"
"“伊斯雷尔，”西尔弗说，“你真不开窍，向来如此。但是我想，你还是能够听得进话的吧，至少，你的耳朵还够大。现在，你给我听好了：你还要住在前舱，要过苦日子，你要小心说话，保持清醒，直到我下令为止；你要记住，孩子。”","“Israel,” said Silver, “your head ain’t much account, nor ever was.But you’re able to hear, I reckon; leastways, your ears is big enough.Now, here’s what I say: you’ll berth forward, and you’ll live hard, and you’ll speak soft, and you’ll keep sober till I give the word; and you may lay to that, my son.”"
"“哎，我没有说不要，我说了吗？”舵手气咻咻地说。“我问的是，要等到什么时候？这就是我说的。”","“Well, I don’t say no, do I?” growled the coxswain.“What I say is, when?That’s what I say.”"
"“什么时候！天晓得！”西尔弗叫道。“那好，你要想知道，我来告诉你什么时候。直到最后一刻，就是那个时候。斯莫利特船长是个一流的海员，他为我们驾驶着这条破船。乡绅和医生拿着那地图之类的东西——我不知道它在哪里。你也不知道，是不是？嗯，我的意思是，乡绅和医生会找到宝藏，再帮咱们运上船，老天。我们到那时再说。要是我能信得过你们这些荷兰崽子的话，我还会让斯莫利特船长在回程时再给我们开半路的船，然后再动手。”","“When! By the powers!” cried Silver.“Well now, if you want to know, I’ll tell you when.The last moment I can manage, and that’s when.Here’s a first-rate seaman, Cap’n Smollett, sails the blessed ship for us.Here’s this squire and doctor with a map and such—I don’t know where it is, do I?No more do you, says you.Well then, I mean this squire and doctor shall find the stuff, and help us to get it aboard, by the powers.Then we’ll see.If I was sure of you all, sons of double Dutchmen, I’d have Cap’n Smollett navigate us half-way back again before I struck.”"
"“哎，我们这船上的可都是水手啊。我想……”那个叫迪克的小伙子说。","“Why, we’re all seamen aboard here, I should think,” said the lad Dick."
"“可我们都是普通水手。”西尔弗打断了他的话，“我们可以按着既定航线行驶，但是谁懂得制定航线呢？你们谁也没那个能耐。如果我有办法，我会让斯莫利特船长至少带我们驶进信风带，那样我们就能避免计算错误，也不用一天只喝一勺淡水。但是我知道你们的为人。财宝一装上船，我就在岛上结果了他们，这未免可惜。你们不喝得醉醺醺的是不会高兴的。走开，跟你们一起出海真是让我恶心！”","“We’re all forecastle hands, you mean,” snapped Silver.“We can steer a course, but who’s to set one?That’s what all you gentlemen split on, first and last.If I had my way, I’d have Cap’n Smollett work us back into the trades at least; then we’d have no blessed miscalculations and a spoonful of water a day.But I know the sort you are.I’ll finish with ‘em at the island, as soon’s the blunt’s on board, and a pity it is.But you’re never happy till you’re drunk.Split my sides, I’ve a sick heart to sail with the likes of you!”"
"“得了吧，高个子约翰，”伊斯雷尔叫道，“谁跟你作对啦？”","“Easy all, Long John,” cried Israel.“Who’s a crossin’ of you?”"
"“哎，你知道我看过有多少条大船被袭击吗？又有多少年轻小伙子在码头刑场给吊死晒干？”西尔弗尖声说，“这一切都是因为急躁,急躁，还是急躁。听见我说的了吗？我在海上是见识过些事的，真的。要是你们能制定航线，见风掌舵的话，你们就能坐上四轮马车了，一定能的。但是你们不行！我了解你们。你们只想要喝饱了朗姆酒，然后上绞架呢。”","“Why, how many tall ships, think ye, now, have I seen laid aboard?And how many brisk lads drying in the sun at Execution Dock?” cried Silver.“And all for this same hurry and hurry and hurry.You hear me?I seen a thing or two at sea, I have.If you would on’y lay your course, and a p’int to windward, you would ride in carriages, you would.But not you!I know you.You’ll have your mouthful of rum tomorrow, and go hang.”"
"“人人都知道你就像个教士，约翰。但是也有人可以卷帆掌舵，做得同你一样好。”伊斯雷尔说，“他们只是喜欢找找乐子，的确。他们可不这样古板高深，而是自由自在，个个开开心心。”","“Everybody knowed you was a kind of a chapling, John; but there’s others as could hand and steer as well as you,” said Israel.“They liked a bit o’ fun, they did.They wasn’t so high and dry, nohow, but took their fling, like jolly companions every one.”"
"“那又如何？”西尔弗说，“他们现在又在哪儿呢？皮尤是那样的人，但是他这乞丐死了。弗林特也是，他在萨凡纳喝酒喝死了。啊，他们曾是亲切的水手，确实是！只是，他们现在在哪儿呢？”","“So?” said Silver.“Well, and where are they now?Pew was that sort, and he died a beggar—man.Flint was, and he died of rum at Savannah.Ah, they was a sweet crew, they was!On’y, where are they?”"
"“但是，”迪克问道，“当他们落在我们手中时，应该怎么处置他们呢？”","“But,” asked Dick, “when we do lay ‘em athwart, what are we to do with ‘em, anyhow?”"
"“这才像我的好汉！”厨子赞赏地说道，“这才像能干出番事业的样子。那么，你怎么想？把他们像流放者似的丢到荒岛上？那是英格兰的做法。还是像猪肉似的剁了？那是弗林特或者比尔·博恩斯的做法。”","“There’s the man for me!” cried the cook admiringly.“That’s what I call business.Well, what would you think?Put ‘em ashore like maroons?That would have been England’s way.Or cut ‘em down like that much pork?That would have been Flint’s, or Billy Bones’s.”"
"“比利是会那样做的。”伊斯雷尔说，“他曾说：‘死人不咬人。’好啦，现在他自己也死了，也能够体会到了。要说哪个心狠手辣的家伙活到头了，那就是比利了。”","“Billy was the man for that,” said Israel.“‘Dead men don’t bite,’ said he.Well, he’s dead now hisself; he knows the long and short on it now; and if ever a rough hand come to port, it was Billy.”"
"“说得对，”西尔弗说，“差不多是这样。但是，你听着，我是个很好相处的人，可以说是个绅士，但是这次事关重大。我们得公事公办，伙计们。我的意思是，杀了他们。以后等我进了议会，坐上马车，我可不想这些在特舱里夸夸其谈的家伙突然出其不意地回家来，好像祈祷时突然出现魔鬼一样。我认为我们应该等待，但是一旦时机成熟，哎，就把他们统统干掉！”","“Right you are,” said Silver; “rough and ready.But mark you here, I’m an easy man—I’m quite the gentleman, says you; but this time it’s serious.Dooty is dooty, mates.I give my vote death.When I’m in Parlyment and riding in my coach, I don’t want none of these sea-lawyers in the cabin a coming home, unlooked for, like the devil at prayers.Wait is what I say; but when the time comes, why, let her rip!”"
"“约翰，”舵手叫道，“你真了不起！”","“John,” cried the coxswain, “you’re a man!”"
"“伊斯雷尔，你就等着瞧吧。”西尔弗说，“我只有一个要求：我要亲手处置特里劳尼。我要把他那小牛似的脑袋亲手扭下来，迪克！”","“You’ll say so, Israel when you see,” said Silver.“Only one thing I claim—I claim Trelawney.I’ll wring his calf’s head off his body with these hands, Dick!”"
"他停了一下，接着说：“你起来，好小伙子，去给我拿个苹果润润嗓子。”","He added, breaking off.“You just jump up, like a sweet lad, and get me an apple, to wet my pipe like.”"
"你可以想象到我当时害怕成什么样子！如果我还有力气，我一定会跳出木桶赶紧逃命，但是我的四肢和心脏全都不听使唤了。我听见迪克起身，接着有人似乎拦住了他，汉兹的声音说道：“哦，慢着！约翰，别吃那脏兮兮的鬼东西了。我们去拿点朗姆酒吧。”","You may fancy the terror I was in!I should have leaped out and run for it if I had found the strength, but my limbs and heart alike misgave me.I heard Dick begin to rise, and then someone seemingly stopped him, and the voice of Hands exclaimed, “Oh, stow that!Don’t you get sucking of that bilge, John.Let’s have a go of the rum.”"
"“迪克，”西尔弗说，“我相信你。听着，那小桶上有个量杯。这是钥匙；你去倒一杯然后拿上来。”","“Dick,” said Silver, “I trust you.I’ve a gauge on the keg, mind.There’s the key; you fill a pannikin and bring it up.”"
"虽然我很害怕，我还是禁不住暗自想到，阿罗先生一定就是这样搞到那些毁了他的烈酒的。","Terrified as I was, I could not help thinking to myself that this must have been how Mr. Arrow got the strong waters that destroyed him."
"迪克去了一小会就回来了。他离开时，伊斯雷尔凑在厨子耳朵边说起了悄悄话。我只能听到一两个字眼，但是我仍然得到了一些重要的信息。因为，除了一些断断续续意思差不多的对话之外，我完整地听到了这句话：“再没其他人愿意加入了。”这样说来，这船上依旧是有忠诚的人的。","Dick was gone but a little while, and during his absence Israel spoke straight on in the cook’s ear.It was but a word or two that I could catch, and yet I gathered some important news, for besides other scraps that tended to the same purpose, this whole clause was audible: “Not another man of them’ll jine.”Hence there were still faithful men on board."
"迪克回来后，这三个人依次端过杯子喝酒，一个说“祝好运”，另一个说“为老弗林特干杯”，西尔弗自己则用唱歌似的语调说“为我们自己干杯，祝咱们占得时机，财源滚滚，享用不尽。”","When Dick returned, one after another of the trio took the pannikin and drank—one “To luck,” another with a “Here’s to old Flint,”and Silver himself saying, in a kind of song, “Here’s to ourselves, and hold your luff, plenty of prizes and plenty of duff.”"
"这时，一线光亮照进木桶，我看见月亮已经升起来了，在后桅纵帆的顶上洒下银色的光辉，把前桅帆也照得雪白。几乎在同时，瞭望员大声叫道：“看，陆地！”","Just then a sort of brightness fell upon me in the barrel, and looking up, I found the moon had risen and was silvering the mizzen-top and shining white on the luff of the fore-sail; and almost at the same time the voice of the lookout shouted, “Land ho!”"
"第十二章 军事会议","Chapter 12 Council of War "
"甲板上响过一阵匆忙的脚步声。我听见人们急急地从船舱和水手舱里冲出来。于是我立刻从木桶里跳出来，偷偷溜到前帆后面去，朝船尾跑了几步，然后来到开阔的甲板上，正好碰上亨特和利夫西医生，于是就和他们一起奔向正在上风处的船头。","There was a great rush of feet across the deck.I could hear people tumbling up from the cabin and the forecastle, and slipping in an instant outside my barrel, I dived behind the fore-sail, made a double towards the stern, and came out upon the open deck in time to join Hunter and Dr. Livesey in the rush for the weather bow."
"全体船员都已经聚集在那儿了。月亮露出云端的同时，一条薄雾带也已经散去。我们向西南方向看去，有两座低矮的小山，彼此相隔大约几英里远；一座山的背后矗立着另一座高山，山峰仍隐藏在雾中。三座山都呈尖尖的圆锥形。","There all hands were already congregated.A belt of fog had lifted almost simultaneously with the appearance of the moon.Away to the south-west of us we saw two low hills, about a couple of miles apart, and rising behind one of them a third and higher hill, whose peak was still buried in the fog.All three seemed sharp and conical in figure."
"看着这些，我仿佛是在梦中，因为我还没从一两分钟前那可怕的惊恐中缓过神来。然后我听到斯莫利特船长在发号施令。伊斯帕尼奥拉号与风向又接近了几个罗经点，现在正掠过海岛的东侧行驶着。","So much I saw, almost in a dream, for I had not yet recovered from my horrid fear of a minute or two before.And then I heard the voice of Captain Smollett issuing orders.The HISPANIOLA was laid a couple of points nearer the wind and now sailed a course that would just clear the island on the east."
"“现在，伙计们，”等所有的帆脚索都拉紧后，船长说，“你们中有谁曾经见过眼前的这块陆地？”","“And now, men,” said the captain, when all was sheeted home, “has any one of you ever seen that land ahead?”"
"“我见过，先生。”西尔弗说，“我以前在一条商船上当厨子时，曾在这里取过水。”","“I have, sir,” said Silver.“I’ve watered there with a trader I was cook in.”"
"“那么我想，应当是在南边下锚，在岛后面？”船长问。","“The anchorage is on the south, behind an islet, I fancy?” asked the captain."
"“是的，先生。这岛叫做骷髅岛。这里曾一度是海盗聚集的地方，那时我们船上有个人知道这岛上每个地方的名字。北边那座山叫做‘前桅山’。这三座山自北向南排成一列，依次叫‘前桅’，‘主桅’和‘后桅’，先生。但是，‘主桅山’——就是那座高的，山上有云的那座——人们通常称之为‘望远镜山’，因为海盗们在停泊清洗船只时，总是让人在那里瞭望放哨；因为他们就是在那里洗船的，先生，原谅我冒昧。”","“Yes, sir; Skeleton Island they calls it.It were a main place for pirates once, and a hand we had on board knowed all their names for it.That hill to the nor’ard they calls the Fore-mast Hill; there are three hills in a row running south’ard-fore, main, and mizzen, sir.But the main—that’s the big un, with the cloud on it—they usually calls the Spy-glass, by reason of a lookout they kept when they was in the anchorage cleaning, for it’s there they cleaned their ships, sir, asking your pardon.”"
"“我这有张地图。”斯莫利特船长说，“看看是不是就是这儿。”","“I have a chart here,” said Captain Smollett.“See if that’s the place.”"
"高个子约翰拿到地图时，两眼放光，但是我一看见地图纸张簇新，就知道约翰肯定要失望了。那不是我们在比利·博恩斯的聚魂棺里找到的地图，而是一份副本，所有的名称、海拔和水深都有，只是没有红色的十字记号和标注说明。西尔弗尽管恨得直咬牙，但他努力不动声色。","Long John’s eyes burned in his head as he took the chart, but by the fresh look of the paper I knew he was doomed to disappointment.This was not the map we found in Billy Bones’s chest, but an accurate copy, complete in all things names and heights and soundings with the single exception of the red crosses and the written notes.Sharp as must have been his annoyance, Silver had the strength of mind to hide it."
"“是的，先生，”他说，“就是这里，没错，图绘得很好。我想问问，是谁画的？我想那些海盗们没有这么聪明。啊，这里：‘基德船长停船处’——当时我船上的伙伴们就是这样叫它的。南边有一股很强的水流，在岛的西岸向北流去。你说得对，先生，”他说，“应该收起帆，让船处在岛的上风处。至少，如果你想要进港清洗的话，再没有比那一片水域更好的地方了。”","“Yes, sir,” said he, “this is the spot, to be sure, and very prettily drawed out.Who might have done that, I wonder?The pirates were too ignorant, I reckon.Aye, here it is: ‘Capt.Kidd’s Anchorage’—just the name my shipmate called it.There’s a strong current runs along the south, and then away nor’ard up the west coast.Right you was, sir,” said he, “to haul your wind and keep the weather of the island.Leastways, if such was your intention as to enter and careen, and there ain’t no better place for that in these waters.”"
"“谢谢你，伙计，”斯莫利特船长说，“过后我还要再叫你帮忙。你可以走了。”","“Thank you, my man,” said Captain Smollett.“I’ll ask you later on to give us a help.You may go.”"
"看到约翰这么冷静地承认自己了解这座岛，我实在有点吃惊。我承认，当我看见他向我走过来的时候，真是吓坏了。当然，他并不知道我从苹果桶里偷听到了他的作战部署，但是这次，我为他的残忍、狡诈和弄权而感到深深的恐惧。当他把手搭在我的肩上时，我禁不住颤抖了一下。","I was surprised at the coolness with which John avowed his knowledge of the island, and I own I was half-frightened when I saw him drawing nearer to myself.He did not know, to be sure, that I had overheard his council from the apple barrel, and yet I had by this time taken such a horror of his cruelty, duplicity, and power that I could scarce conceal a shudder when he laid his hand upon my arm."
"“啊，”他说，“那可是个好地方，这座岛，对于小伙子来说，是个上岸的好地方。你可以去游泳、爬树，也可以去打山羊，都可以。你还可以自己像头山羊似的爬到山上去。哎，这让我又觉得年轻了。我都快忘掉我这条木腿了，真的。年轻真好，可以有十个脚趾头，你要记住这一点。要是你想去探探险，就来告诉老约翰，我会给你准备点儿吃的带上。”","“Ah,” said he, “this here is a sweet spot, this island—a sweet spot for a lad to get ashore on.You’ll bathe, and you’ll climb trees, and you’ll hunt goats, you will; and you’ll get aloft on them hills like a goat yourself.Why, it makes me young again.I was going to forget my timber leg, I was.It’s a pleasant thing to be young and have ten toes, and you may lay to that.When you want to go a bit of exploring, you just ask old John, and he’ll put up a snack for you to take along.”"
"他友好地在我肩头上拍了拍，一瘸一拐地走开，下到船舱去了。","And clapping me in the friendliest way upon the shoulder, he hobbled off forward and went below."
"斯莫利特船长、乡绅和利夫西医生正在船后甲板上说话，尽管我很想告诉他们我所听到的事情，我仍然不敢贸然打断他们。正当我仍在搜肠刮肚，想找到一些合适的借口时，利夫西医生叫我到他那边去。他把他的烟斗忘在下面了，他离不开烟，所以叫我去取烟斗。但是，我一接近他，近到不会被别人偷听时，我就立刻对他说：“医生，听我说。让船长和乡绅下到船舱里，然后找个理由让人来把我也喊去。我知道一些可怕的事情。”","Captain Smollett, the squire, and Dr. Livesey were talking together on the quarter-deck, and anxious as I was to tell them my story, I durst not interrupt them openly.While I was still casting about in my thoughts to find some probable excuse, Dr. Livesey called me to his side.He had left his pipe below, and being a slave to tobacco, had meant that I should fetch it; but as soon as I was near enough to speak and not to be overheard, I broke immediately, “Doctor, let me speak.Get the captain and squire down to the cabin, and then make some pretence to send for me.I have terrible news.”"
"医生的脸色微微变了，但是瞬间又恢复如初。","The doctor changed countenance a little, but next moment he was master of himself."
"“谢谢你，吉姆，”他大声说，“我想知道的就是这些。”好像他问了我一个问题似的。","“Thank you, Jim,” said he quite loudly, “that was all I wanted to know,” as if he had asked me a question."
"说完，他转身和另外两位说起话来。他们又说了一会。虽然他们谁都没有表现出吃惊的样子，也没人提高嗓门或吹起口哨，但是，很显然利夫西医生已经告诉了他们我的请求，因为，紧接着我就听见船长给乔布·安德森下了个令，吹哨把所有船员都召集到了甲板上。","And with that he turned on his heel and rejoined the other two.They spoke together for a little, and though none of them started, or raised his voice, or so much as whistled, it was plain enough that Dr. Livesey had communicated my request, for the next thing that I heard was the captain giving an order to Job Anderson, and all hands were piped on deck."
"“伙计们，”斯莫利特船长说，“我有句话要对你们说。我们看见的这片陆地就是我们的目的地。特里劳尼先生，我们都知道他是个很慷慨的绅士，他刚刚问了我一两句话。因而我告诉他，船上的每个人都尽忠职守，一切顺意，比我要求的还要好。所以，他、我和医生要下到舱里去为你们的健康好运喝几杯，同时也为你们准备了兑水烈酒喝，好让你们为我们的健康好运干杯。","“My lads,” said Captain Smollett, “I’ve a word to say to you.This land that we have sighted is the place we have been sailing for.Mr. Trelawney, being a very open-handed gentleman, as we all know, has just asked me a word or two, and as I was able to tell him that every man on board had done his duty, alow and aloft, as I never ask to see it done better, why, he and I and the doctor are going below to the cabin to drink YOUR health and luck, and you’ll have grog served out for you to drink OUR health and luck."
"让我来告诉你们我怎么想的：我觉得这棒极了。如果你们跟我想的一样，就为这位提供酒水的绅士欢呼一声吧。”","I’ll tell you what I think of this: I think it handsome.And if you think as I do, you’ll give a good sea-cheer for the gentleman that does it.”"
"接着，人群欢呼起来——那是理所当然的。但是他们的欢呼是那么真挚热切，我几乎不敢相信这些人在密谋要害我们的性命。","The cheer followed—that was a matter of course; but it rang out so full and hearty that I confess I could hardly believe these same men were plotting for our blood."
"当欢呼声减弱下去时，高个子约翰叫道：“再为斯莫利特船长来一次。”","“One more cheer for Cap’n Smollett,” cried Long John when the first had subsided."
"于是，大家再一次热烈地欢呼起来。","And this also was given with a will."
"三位绅士在欢呼声中走下船舱，不久，有人传话说要吉姆·霍金斯也到船舱去。","On the top of that the three gentlemen went below, and not long after, word was sent forward that Jim Hawkins was wanted in the cabin."
"我看见他们三个围桌而坐，桌上放着一瓶西班牙葡萄酒和一些葡萄干。医生在抽烟，假发放在大腿上。我知道，这表示他正心神不宁。这是个温暖的夜晚，船尾窗开着，可以看见月光照在船留下的浪迹上。","I found them all three seated round the table, a bottle of Spanish wine and some raisins before them, and the doctor smoking away, with his wig on his lap, and that, I knew, was a sign that he was agitated.The stern window was open, for it was a warm night, and you could see the moon shining behind on the ship’s wake."
"“好了，霍金斯，”乡绅说，“你有些话要说。现在就说吧。”","“Now, Hawkins,” said the squire, “you have something to say.Speak up.”"
"我照吩咐尽量简短地说了，告诉了他们西尔弗谈话的全部细节。我说的时候没人打断我，三个人动也没动一下，他们从始至终地把目光盯在我的脸上。","I did as I was bid, and as short as I could make it, told the whole details of Silver’s conversation.Nobody interrupted me till I was done, nor did any one of the three of them make so much as a movement, but they kept their eyes upon my face from first to last."
"“吉姆，”利夫西医生说，“坐下来。”","“Jim,” said Dr. Livesey, “take a seat.”"
"他们让我挨着他们在桌边坐下，给我倒了一杯酒，又抓了把葡萄干塞在我手里。这三个人为我的健康干杯，又依次向我欠身致谢，因为我的运气和勇气。","And they made me sit down at table beside them, poured me out a glass of wine, filled my hands with raisins, and all three, one after the other, and each with a bow, drank my good health, and their service to me, for my luck and courage."
"“船长，”乡绅说，“你是对的，我错了。我真是蠢，现在我听从你的指挥。”","“Now, captain,” said the squire, “you were right, and I was wrong.I own myself an ass, and I await your orders.”"
"“没有我蠢，先生。”船长说，“我从没听说过哪伙船员想要叛变，而事先不露出马脚的，因为任何一个头上长了眼睛的人都能看出这诡计，然后采取行动。但是这帮人，”他补充道，“他们骗了我。”","“No more an ass than I, sir,” returned the captain.“I never heard of a crew that meant to mutiny but what showed signs before, for any man that had an eye in his head to see the mischief and take steps according.But this crew,” he added, “beats me.”"
"“船长，”医生说，“请允许我说一句，这全都是西尔弗的把戏。他可真是个有能耐的家伙。”","“Captain,” said the doctor, “with your permission, that’s Silver.A very remarkable man.”"
"“把他给吊在船帆桁端上，那才真是有能耐呢，先生。”船长答道，“但这都只是说说而已，并没有任何作用。我想到了三四点，若特里劳尼先生允许的话，我可以说一说。”","“He’d look remarkably well from a yard-arm, sir,” returned the captain.“But this is talk; this don’t lead to anything.I see three or four points, and with Mr. Trelawney’s permission, I’ll name them.”"
"“先生，你是船长。你就是来发话的。”特里劳尼先生郑重地说。","“You, sir, are the captain.It is for you to speak,” said Mr. Trelawney grandly."
"“第一，”斯莫利特先生说，我们要继续走，因为我们不能返航。”要是我下令返航，他们立即就会动手。第二，我们还有时间——至少在找到宝藏之前。第三，还是有忠诚的人的。那么，先生，我们迟早要进行还击的。我认为，正如俗语所说的，我们要‘把握时机’，要打他个出其不意。我想，你自己带来的人还是可信的吧，特里劳尼先生？”","“First point,” began Mr. Smollett.“We must go on, because we can’t turn back.If I gave the word to go about, they would rise at once.Second point, we have time before us—at least until this treasure’s found.Third point, there are faithful hands.Now, sir, it’s got to come to blows sooner or later, and what I propose is to take time by the forelock, as the saying is, and come to blows some fine day when they least expect it.We can count, I take it, on your own home servants, Mr. Trelawney?”"
"“就如我自己一样可信。”乡绅说。","“As upon myself,” declared the squire."
"“三个，”船长算着，“加上我们自己，包括霍金斯，一共是七个。再来看看还有哪些忠诚的人手？”","“Three,” reckoned the captain; “ourselves make seven, counting Hawkins here.Now, about the honest hands?”"
"“大多数都是特里劳尼先生自己的人，”医生说，“是他在偶然遇到西尔弗之前亲自挑选的。”","“Most likely Trelawney’s own men,” said the doctor; “those he had picked up for himself before he lit on Silver.”"
"“不，”乡绅回答道，“汉兹以前也是我们的人。”","“Nay,” replied the squire.“Hands was one of mine.”"
"“我曾经也认为汉兹是可以信赖的。”船长也说。","“I did think I could have trusted Hands,” added the captain."
"“想想看，他们可全都是英国人呐！”乡绅大声喊道。“先生，我心里可真想把船给炸了。”","“And to think that they’re all Englishmen!” broke out the squire.“Sir, I could find it in my heart to blow the ship up.”"
"“绅士们，”船长说，“我再没什么好说的了。要是你愿意，我们必须要保持镇定自若，同时提高警惕。这对人是个考验，我知道。但总比打起来要好。但是，直到我们了解了我们的船员之前，这样也没什么用。镇定自若，等待时机，这就是我的看法。”","“Well, gentlemen,” said the captain, “the best that I can say is not much.We must lay to, if you please, and keep a bright lookout.It’s trying on a man, I know.It would be pleasanter to come to blows.But there’s no help for it till we know our men.Lay to, and whistle for a wind, that’s my view.”"
"“有吉姆在这里，”医生说，“比任何人都有用。水手们在他面前毫无顾虑，而吉姆也是个上心的孩子。”","“Jim here,” said the doctor, “can help us more than anyone.The men are not shy with him, and Jim is a noticing lad.”"
"“霍金斯，我对你寄予厚望。”乡绅也说。","“Hawkins, I put prodigious faith in you,” added the squire."
"我开始觉得对此有些绝望，因为我感到很无助。然而后来，事情发展得十分奇异，倒也真使我成了让大家转危为安的人物。同时，尽管我们在说着，在那二十六个人当中，我们确实能信赖的只有七个人。而在这七个人当中，还有一个是孩子，因此，我们这边的六个成人要对付他们十九个人。","I began to feel pretty desperate at this, for I felt altogether helpless; and yet, by an odd train of circumstances, it was indeed through me that safety came.In the meantime, talk as we pleased, there were only seven out of the twenty-six on whom we knew we could rely; and out of these seven one was a boy, so that the grown men on our side were six to their nineteen."
"第十三章 开始我的陆上冒险","Chapter 13 How My Shore Adventure Began "
"第二天早上，我在甲板上一看，出现在我眼前的岛屿已与昨日完全不同了。虽然现在微风已经停了，我们在夜里也走了很多路，但现在船正安静地停在距离低矮的东海岸大约半英里远的东南方向。岛屿的一大半都被灰色的树木覆盖。这均匀的色调中夹杂着处于低处的带状黄色沙地；也夹杂着很多松衫科的高大树木。它们有的独自矗立，有的成群生长，比其他树都要高出一些。但是，岛上的总体色调还是单调阴沉的。小山耸立在植被之上，山顶上岩石裸露。这些山都是奇形怪状的，望远镜山是岛上最高的山，比其他山高出个三四百英尺。它同样也是外貌最古怪的一座山，每一面的岩壁都很陡峭，山顶如刀削一般平整，好像是放雕像的基座。","The appearance of the island when I came on deck next morning was altogether changed.Although the breeze had now utterly ceased, we had made a great deal of way during the night and were now lying becalmed about half a mile to the south-east of the low eastern coast.Grey-coloured woods covered a large part of the surface.This even tint was indeed broken up by streaks of yellow sand—break in the lower lands, and by many tall trees of the pine family, out-topping the others—some singly, some in clumps; but the general colouring was uniform and sad.The hills ran up clear above the vegetation in spires of naked rock.All were strangely shaped, and the Spy-glass, which was by three or four hundred feet the tallest on the island, was likewise the strangest in configuration, running up sheer from almost every side and then suddenly cut off at the top like a pedestal to put a statue on."
"伊斯帕尼奥拉号随着海面的起伏而摇晃，排水口时而被水淹没。帆杠几乎要把滑车扯了下来，船舵被浪打得左右摇摆，发出巨大的响声。整条船嘎吱作响，呻吟着上下颠簸，好像一间作坊。我不得不抓紧后牵索，在我眼里，整个世界都摇摇晃晃的，虽然我一路上都是个挺不错的水手，但是站在这里，被像个瓶子似的旋转着，还要能站稳不头晕，这本事我可没有，尤其是在早上空腹的时候。","The HISPANIOLA was rolling scuppers under in the ocean swell.The booms were tearing at the blocks, the rudder was banging to and fro, and the whole ship creaking, groaning, and jumping like a manufactory.I had to cling tight to the backstay, and the world turned giddily before my eyes, for though I was a good enough sailor when there was way on, this standing still and being rolled about like a bottle was a thing I never learned to stand without a qualm or so, above all in the morning, on an empty stomach."
"也许是因为这样——也许是因为小岛的样子：那些灰色阴郁的树林；岩石裸露的山顶；我们能够看见，也能听见，海浪怒吼着在陡峭的岸边卷起泡沫——虽然阳光明媚温暖，海岸上的飞鸟一边在我们周围鸣叫着，一边捉鱼，而你也会觉得，任何一个在海上漂泊了这么久的人，都应当对能够上岸而感到很高兴。但是，就像俗话说的，我“心情沉重”，从我第一眼见到小岛起，我就恨透了金银岛。","Perhaps it was this—perhaps it was the look of the island, with its grey, melancholy woods, and wild stone spires, and the surf that we could both see and hear foaming and thundering on the steep beach—at least, although the sun shone bright and hot, and the shore birds were fishing and crying all around us,and you would have thought anyone would have been glad to get to land after being so long at sea, my heart sank, as the saying is, into my boots; and from the first look onward, I hated the very thought of Treasure Island."
"我们有一上午辛苦的工作要做，现在一丝风也没有，必须要放下小船，载着水手，用纤绳拉着船走三四英里，绕过小岛的一角，顺着一条狭窄的水道进入骷髅岛背后的港湾。我自告奋勇，上了其中一条小船，当然，我在小船上没什么活可干。天热得叫人浑身没劲，大伙边干活边大声抱怨着。安德森负责我上的这条小船，他非但不去维持船上的秩序，反而跟那些抱怨得最凶的人一样发牢骚。","We had a dreary morning’s work before us, for there was no sign of any wind, and the boats had to be got out and manned, and the ship warped three or four miles round the corner of the island and up the narrow passage to the haven behind Skeleton Island.I volunteered for one of the boats, where I had, of course, no business.The heat was sweltering, and the men grumbled fiercely over their work.Anderson was in command of my boat, and instead of keeping the crew in order, he grumbled as loud as the worst."
"“真是，”他骂骂咧咧地说，“快到头了。”","“Well,” he said with an oath, “it’s not forever.”"
"我觉得这不是个好迹象，因为直到那天之前，大家还都起劲地干着活，但是一看到金银岛，就都放松了纪律的约束。","I thought this was a very bad sign, for up to that day the men had gone briskly and willingly about their business; but the very sight of the island had relaxed the cords of discipline."
"船进入海港的一路上，高个子约翰一直站在舵手旁边指挥着船前进。他对水路十分熟悉，简直是了如指掌，尽管测量的人测出的水深一直都比地图上所标示出的要深，约翰却从没犹豫过。","All the way in, Long John stood by the steersman and conned the ship.He knew the passage like the palm of his hand, and though the man in the chains got everywhere more water than was down in the chart, John never hesitated once."
"“退潮时海水冲刷得很厉害，”他说，“因此可以说，这里的水道都变深了，好像铲子挖过的一样。”","“There’s a strong scour with the ebb,” he said, “and this here passage has been dug out, in a manner of speaking, with a spade.”"
"我们来到了地图上标出的停泊处，位于主岛和骷髅岛的中间，距离两岸大概都是三分之一英里远。水底是干净的细沙。抛锚的响声惊起了一群群飞鸟，它们在树顶上空盘旋、鸣叫着，但是，不一会就又落了回去，一切显得愈发寂静了。","We brought up just where the anchor was in the chart, about a third of a mile from each shore, the mainland on one side and Skeleton Island on the other.The bottom was clean sand.The plunge of our anchor sent up clouds of birds wheeling and crying over the woods, but in less than a minute they were down again and all was once more silent."
"这是个内陆港湾，掩映在林子中，树林一直延伸到涨潮时的水位处，海滩十分平整。小山这儿一座，那儿一座，在远处围成了环形，好像一座圆形剧场。两条小河，或者说是两片沼泽，汇入了这个池塘，如果你愿意这么叫它的话。这片海滩周围的植物叶子都闪耀着一种带有毒性的光泽。从船上看去，我们没发现任何房屋或栅栏的影子，因为一切都完全隐藏在树林里。如果不是有船长的地图，我们会以为自小岛诞生以来，我们是第一艘在此抛锚的船。","The place was entirely land-locked, buried in woods, the trees coming right down to high-water mark, the shores mostly flat, and the hilltops standing round at a distance in a sort of amphitheatre, one here, one there.Two little rivers, or rather two swamps, emptied out into this pond, as you might call it; and the foliage round that part of the shore had a kind of poisonous brightness.From the ship we could see nothing of the house or stockade, for they were quite buried among trees; and if it had not been for the chart on the companion, we might have been the first that had ever anchored there since the island arose out of the seas."
"空气凝滞不动。半英里外，海浪撞击着海岸，冲刷着礁石，发出隆隆的响声，除此之外，再听不见其他的声音了。一种奇特的污浊气味环绕在抛锚的地方，那是潮腐的树叶和朽烂的树干的气味。我注意到医生不停地嗅着，好像在闻一只臭鸡蛋。","There was not a breath of air moving, nor a sound but that of the surf booming half a mile away along the beaches and against the rocks outside.A peculiar stagnant smell hung over the anchorage—a smell of sodden leaves and rotting tree trunks.I observed the doctor sniffing and sniffing, like someone tasting a bad egg."
"“我不了解什么宝藏，”他说，“但我敢拿我的假发打赌，这地方一定有热病。”","“I don’t know about treasure,”he said, “but I’ll stake my wig there’s fever here.”"
"如果说大家在小船上的表现已经令人不安，那么，回到大船上之后，他们的表现则变得让人感到恐惧。大家在甲板上闲荡，聚在一起低声发牢骚。哪怕只是要求做一点点小事，他们都会怒目而视，然后极不情愿地敷衍了事。即使是最老实的人也一定受了影响，因为船上没有一个人试图去改正别人。很显然，叛变的气息像雷雨前的阴云一样笼罩在我们头顶上。","If the conduct of the men had been alarming in the boat, it became truly threatening when they had come aboard.They lay about the deck growling together in talk.The slightest order was received with a black look and grudgingly and carelessly obeyed.Even the honest hands must have caught the infection, for there was not one man aboard to mend another.Mutiny, it was plain, hung over us like a thunder-cloud."
"而且，并不只是我们这几个曾在特舱里密谈过的人觉察到了危险。高个子约翰正辛苦地工作着，从一组人身边转到另一组人身边，不遗余力地给出建议，好像再没人能比他做出更好的榜样了似的。他积极主动，客气有礼，比他自己平时表现得要好多了，他对每一个人都面带微笑。一旦有命令下达，约翰就立刻拄起他的拐杖，用世界上最快乐的语气答应着：“是，是，先生！”如果没什么事可做，他就一首接一首地唱歌，好像想要借此掩饰其他人的不满。","And it was not only we of the cabin party who perceived the danger.Long John was hard at work going from group to group, spending himself in good advice, and as for example no man could have shown a better.He fairly outstripped himself in willingness and civility; he was all smiles to everyone.If an order were given, John would be on his crutch in an instant, with the cheeriest “Aye, aye, sir!”In the world; and when there was nothing else to do, he kept up one song after another, as if to conceal the discontent of the rest."
"那个阴沉的下午，在所有阴沉的预兆之中，高个子约翰所表现出来的明显的焦虑不安是最糟糕的。","Of all the gloomy features of that gloomy afternoon, this obvious anxiety on the part of Long John appeared the worst."
"我们在特舱里开了一次会。","We held a council in the cabin."
"“先生，”船长说，“如果我再冒险下一次令，整船的人都要立刻起来造反了。先生，你瞧，是这样的。我给粗暴地顶撞了回来，不是吗？如果我回嘴的话，立刻就要动刀动枪；而如果我不反击，西尔弗就会看出一些端倪，那么我们就全完了。现在我们只能依靠一个人了。”","“Sir,” said the captain, “if I risk another order, the whole ship’ll come about our ears by the run.You see, sir, here it is.I get a rough answer, do I not?Well, if I speak back, pikes will be going in two shakes; if I don’t, Silver will see there’s something under that, and the game’s up.Now, we’ve only one man to rely on.”"
"“是谁？”乡绅问道。","“And who is that?” asked the squire."
"“西尔弗。先生，”船长回答，“他和你我一样着急，想要把事态压下去。那些不过是些小争执；如果他有机会的话，一定能说服他们不再继续。我想要做的就是给他这个机会。我们不如让大伙上岸呆上一个下午。如果他们都下去了，那我们就能占据大船作战。如果他们没一个下船，那么，我们守住特舱，让上帝来维护正义吧。如果只有一些人下去，你记住，阁下，等他们再上船时，西尔弗会让他们温顺得跟绵羊似的。”","“Silver, sir,” returned the captain; “he’s as anxious as you and I to smother things up.This is a tiff; he’d soon talk ‘em out of it if he had the chance, and what I propose to do is to give him the chance.Let’s allow the men an afternoon ashore.If they all go, why we’ll fight the ship.If they none of them go, well then, we hold the cabin, and God defend the right.If some go, you mark my words, sir, Silver’ll bring ‘em aboard again as mild as lambs.”"
"事情就这样决定了。我们这边的每个人都拿上了装满子弹的枪。我们让亨特、乔伊斯和雷德鲁斯也加入了密谈。他们听到消息后，并没有我们所想象得那样惊奇，精神也要比我们预期得要好。然后，船长来到甲板上，对船员们讲话。","It was so decided; loaded pistols were served out to all the sure men; Hunter, Joyce, and Redruth were taken into our confidence and received the news with less surprise and a better spirit than we had looked for, and then the captain went on deck and addressed the crew."
"“伙计们，”他说，“天气太热了，大家也都不舒服。上个岸对大家都没坏处——小船还在水里，你们可以拿来用，谁要是愿意，都可以上岸呆上一个下午。我会在太阳下山前半个小时放一枪，提醒你们回到大船上。”","“My lads,” said he, “we’ve had a hot day and are all tired and out of sorts.A turn ashore’ll hurt nobody—the boats are still in the water; you can take the gigs, and as many as please may go ashore for the afternoon.I’ll fire a gun half an hour before sundown.”"
"我相信，这些愚蠢的家伙们一定以为，一上岸，他们就能为宝藏抢破头，因此他们一扫阴沉的脸色，欢呼起来，远山也响起了回音。欢呼声又一次惊起了飞鸟，在停泊处尖声鸣叫着盘旋。","I believe the silly fellows must have thought they would break their shins over treasure as soon as they were landed, for they all came out of their sulks in a moment and gave a cheer that started the echo in a faraway hill and sent the birds once more flying and squalling round the anchorage."
"为了不挡他们的道，船长非常明智地走开了。他转身就不见了，留下西尔弗来安排。我想幸好他走了。要是他仍待在甲板上，他就再也不能假装对事情一无所知了。这一点显而易见。西尔弗是头儿，领导着一帮很厉害的叛徒。那些忠诚的人——很快我就知道这船上确实还有忠心的人——一定是非常愚笨的家伙。要不然，我觉得事情是这样的：全体船员在叛徒首领的影响下都有些不忠——只不过程度不同罢了；有少数几个人大抵还算得上是好人，他们不会被进一步收买或驱使。表现得无所事事、鬼鬼祟祟是一回事，而攻占一艘船、杀害一群无辜的人则完全是另外一回事。","The captain was too bright to be in the way.He whipped out of sight in a moment, leaving Silver to arrange the party, and I fancy it was as well he did so.Had he been on deck, he could no longer so much as have pretended not to understand the situation.It was as plain as day.Silver was the captain, and a mighty rebellious crew he had of it.The honest hands—and I was soon to see it proved that there were such on board—must have been very stupid fellows.Or rather, I suppose the truth was this, that all hands were disaffected by the example of the ringleaders—only some more, some less; and a few, being good fellows in the main, could neither be led nor driven any further.It is one thing to be idle and skulk and quite another to take a ship and murder a number of innocent men."
"然而，那群人最终分派好了。六个人留在大船上，包括西尔弗在内剩下的十三个人准备上小船。","At last, however, the party was made up.Six fellows were to stay on board, and the remaining thirteen, including Silver, began to embark."
"这时，我的脑海里闪现出一个疯狂的想法，这个想法后来救了我们的命。西尔弗留下了六个人，很显然我们夺不了大船，而既然有六个人留下来了，特舱那边也明显暂时也用不着我帮忙了。于是我立刻想到要上岸。一眨眼我就偷偷翻过船舷，蜷身躲在离我最近的一艘船的船头板下。几乎就在这时，船出发了。","Then it was that there came into my head the first of the mad notions that contributed so much to save our lives.If six men were left by Silver, it was plain our party could not take and fight the ship; and since only six were left, it was equally plain that the cabin party had no present need of my assistance.It occurred to me at once to go ashore.In a jiffy I had slipped over the side and curled up in the fore-sheets of the nearest boat, and almost at the same moment she shoved off."
"没人注意到我，除了船头的桨手说了声：“是你吗，吉姆？低头。”","No one took notice of me, only the bow oar saying, “Is that you, Jim?Keep your head down.”"
"但是，另一条船上的西尔弗立刻用犀利的目光看过来，并大声问那是不是我。那一刻起我开始后悔这么做了。","But Silver, from the other boat, looked sharply over and called out to know if that were me; and from that moment I began to regret what I had done."
"船员们争先恐后地向岸边划去，但是由于我在的这条船较早开动，船身也轻，而且船上水手的技术更高，因此把其他的船都远远甩在身后。船头直插到岸边树林里，我抓住树枝，荡了出去，钻进了最近的灌木丛里。这时西尔弗和其他人还落后足有一百码远。“吉姆，吉姆！”我听见他大声喊道。","The crews raced for the beach, but the boat I was in, having some start and being at once the lighter and the better manned, shot far ahead of her consort, and the bow had struck among the shore-side trees and I had caught a branch and swung myself out and plunged into the nearest thicket while Silver and the rest were still a hundred yards behind.“Jim, Jim!” I heard him shouting."
"但是，你应该猜到我根本没去理会。我一直向前跑去，连蹦带跳，时不时弯腰钻过树丛，直到我再也跑不动了为止。","But you may suppose I paid no heed; jumping, ducking, and breaking through, I ran straight before my nose till I could run no longer."
"第十四章 第一次打击","Chapter 14 The First Blow "
"能够摆脱掉高个子约翰，我高兴极了，开始自得其乐，兴趣盎然地打量起我身处的这片陌生之地了。","I was so pleased at having given the slip to Long John that I began to enjoy myself and look around me with some interest on the strange land that I was in."
"我穿过一片沼泽，那里长满了柳树、灯芯草和许多样子奇异古怪、适合在沼泽生长的树。现在，我来到了一片开阔起伏的沙地边上，长约一英里，零星地长着几棵松树和许多歪歪扭扭的树，外形有点像橡树，但是叶子颜色略淡，像柳树。开阔沙地的另一端是一座小山，两座山峰怪石嶙峋，在阳光下闪着耀眼的光。","I had crossed a marshy tract full of willows, bulrushes, and odd, outlandish, swampy trees; and I had now come out upon the skirts of an open piece of undulating, sandy country, about a mile long, dotted with a few pines and a great number of contorted trees, not unlike the oak in growth, but pale in the foliage, like willows.On the far side of the open stood one of the hills, with two quaint, craggy peaks shining vividly in the sun."
"这是我第一次体会到了探险的快乐。这座岛上无人居住；我的船友们都被我甩在身后。在我前面，除了不会说话的飞禽走兽之外再无活物了。我在树林里这里转转，那里逛逛。到处都是不知名的开花植物；蛇随处可见，其中一条还从岩角上抬起头来，对我发出嘶嘶的声音，有点像陀螺旋转的声音。我一点都没想到它是个致命的危险之物，而那声音正是大名鼎鼎的响尾蛇的标志。","I now felt for the first time the joy of exploration.The isle was uninhabited; my shipmates I had left behind, and nothing lived in front of me but dumb brutes and fowls.I turned hither and thither among the trees.Here and there were flowering plants, unknown to me; here and there I saw snakes, and one raised his head from a ledge of rock and hissed at me with a noise not unlike the spinning of a top.Little did I suppose that he was a deadly enemy and that the noise was the famous rattle."
"接着，我来到一片狭长的灌木丛，那里长着那些形似橡树的树木——后来我听说它们应该叫做长生橡树或者长青橡树。它们像黑莓灌木一样矮矮地沿着沙地生长，树干奇异地扭绞着，树叶茂密如茅草一样。灌木丛自一个沙丘顶上蔓延下来，越往下范围越大、树丛越高，直到一片宽阔的、长满芦苇的沼泽边沿，最近的一条小河就是从这里吸走水、流向抛锚处的。沼泽在烈日下冒着水汽，望远镜山的轮廓在腾腾水汽中微微地颤动。","Then I came to a long thicket of these oaklike trees-live, or evergreen, oaks, I heard afterwards they should be called—which grew low along the sand like brambles, the boughs curiously twisted, the foliage compact, like thatch.The thicket stretched down from the top of one of the sandy knolls, spreading and growing taller as it went, until it reached the margin of the broad, reedy fen, through which the nearest of the little rivers soaked its way into the anchorage.The marsh was steaming in the strong sun, and the outline of the Spy-glass trembled through the haze."
"突然，灯芯草丛中传来一阵窸窣声，一只野鸭子嘎嘎叫着飞了出来，紧跟着又是一只，不一会沼泽上空就聚满了一大群鸭子，尖叫着在空中盘旋。我立刻判断出，这一定是船上的其他人正顺着沼泽边沿走过来。我没有想错，因为不久我就听到了远处有低低的人声。我继续注意听着，那声音渐渐变得愈来愈更响、愈来愈近。","All at once there began to go a sort of bustle among the bulrushes; a wild duck flew up with a quack, another followed, and soon over the whole surface of the marsh a great cloud of birds hung screaming and circling in the air.I judged at once that some of my shipmates must be drawing near along the borders of the fen.Nor was I deceived, for soon I heard the very distant and low tones of a human voice, which, as I continued to give ear, grew steadily louder and nearer."
"这让我非常惊恐，于是我爬到最近的一棵长生橡树下，蹲伏在那里，安静得像只老鼠似地倾听着。","This put me in a great fear, and I crawled under cover of the nearest live-oak and squatted there, hearkening, as silent as a mouse."
"另一个声音答话了；第一个声音——现在我听出那是西尔弗——又接起话头，絮絮叨叨说了好久，只是偶尔被另一人打断。从声音上来说，他们一定是在很认真地说话，几乎到了激烈的地步；但是我一个词也没听清。","Another voice answered, and then the first voice, which I now recognized to be Silver’s, once more took up the story and ran on for a long while in a stream, only now and again interrupted by the other.By the sound they must have been talking earnestly, and almost fiercely; but no distinct word came to my hearing."
"最后，这两个人似乎都停止了说话，可能坐了下来，因为不仅他们不再走近，而且鸭子们也安静下来，再次落回到沼泽里原来的地方。","At last the speakers seemed to have paused and perhaps to have sat down, for not only did they cease to draw any nearer, but the birds themselves began to grow more quiet and to settle again to their places in the swamp."
"这时我开始觉得自己有点不务正业，既然我这么鲁莽地跟着这些亡命之徒一起上了岸，我至少该偷听一点他们开会的内容。很显然，我的任务就是在矮树提供的有利隐蔽下，尽量再靠近他们一些。","And now I began to feel that I was neglecting my business, that since I had been so foolhardy as to come ashore with these desperadoes, the least I could do was to overhear them at their councils, and that my plain and obvious duty was to draw as close as I could manage, under the favourable ambush of the crouching trees."
"我能够很精确地辨认出说话者的位置，不仅是通过他们的声音，还通过观察仍惊恐地盘桓在侵入者头上的那几只鸟的动静。我手脚并用地爬着，稳步、但很缓慢地接近他们，直到最后，我抬头从树叶间的缝隙里看出去。我清楚地看见下面沼泽旁边一小片绿色的谷地上，高个子约翰·西尔弗和另一位船员正面对面站着说话，周围都是树丛。","I could tell the direction of the speakers pretty exactly, not only by the sound of their voices but by the behaviour of the few birds that still hung in alarm above the heads of the intruders.Crawling on all fours, I made steadily but slowly towards them, till at last, raising my head to an aperture among the leaves, I could see clear down into a little green dell beside the marsh, and closely set about with trees, where Long John Silver and another of the crew stood face to face in conversation."
"强烈的阳光照在他们身上。西尔弗把他的帽子扔在一旁的地上，他那张光滑白皙的大脸因为炎热而闪闪发亮。他把脸冲着另外一个人，一脸恳求的神态。","The sun beat full upon them.Silver had thrown his hat beside him on the ground, and his great, smooth, blond face, all shining with heat, was lifted to the other man’s in a kind of appeal."
"“伙计，”他说道，“那是因为我把你看作是尘土中的金子——尘土中的金子，你要相信我！如果不是因为我特别喜欢你，你觉得我还会在这里向你发出警告吗？局势已定——你改变不了了；我告诉你这些是为了救你一命，如果那些野家伙有谁知道了，我是什么下场，告诉我，汤姆，我是什么下场？”","“Mate,” he was saying, “it’s because I thinks gold dust of you—gold dust, and you may lay to that!If I hadn’t took to you like pitch, do you think I’d have been here a warning of you?All’s up—you can’t make nor mend; it’s to save your neck that I’m a speaking, and if one of the wild uns knew it, where’d I be, Tom—now, tell me, where’d I be?”"
"“西尔弗，”另一个人说——我发现他不仅面堂通红，说话声音也和乌鸦一样沙哑，像根拉紧了的绳子一样发颤——“西尔弗，”他说，“你老了，又诚实，至少有这么个名声；而且你有钱，那是很多穷水手所没有的；要是我没看错，你也很勇敢。难道你要告诉我,你愿意让这样一群无赖牵着鼻子走吗？那可不是你！上帝作证，要是我背叛我的职责的话，就叫我失去一只手——”","“Silver,” said the other man—and I observed he was not only red in the face, but spoke as hoarse as a crow, and his voice shook too, like a taut rope—“Silver,” said he, “you’re old, and you’re honest, or has the name for it; and you’ve money too, which lots of poor sailors hasn’t; and you’re brave, or I’m mistook.And will you tell me you’ll let yourself be led away with that kind of a mess of swabs? Not you! As sure as God sees me, I’d sooner lose my hand.If I turn agin my dooty—”"
"突然，他被一个声音打断了。我发现了一个忠诚的水手——就在这里，同时又传来了另一个消息。远处的沼泽地里突然传来一声愤怒的喊叫，接着又是一声；再后来又是一声拖长了的、恐怖的尖叫。声音在望远镜山的岩石间回响了几次；沼泽上的鸟群再一次被惊起，铺天盖地，扇着翅膀，发出呼呼的声音。很久之后，那声死前的喊叫依然回响在我脑海里，寂静恢复如初，只有再次栖息下来的鸟儿发出的窸窣声和远处海浪的轰鸣声打破了午后的沉闷。","And then all of a sudden he was interrupted by a noise.I had found one of the honest hands—well, here, at that same moment, came news of another.Far away out in the marsh there arose, all of a sudden, a sound like the cry of anger, then another on the back of it; and then one horrid, long-drawn scream.The rocks of the Spy-glass re-echoed it a score of times; the whole troop of marsh-birds rose again, darkening heaven, with a simultaneous whirr; and long after that death yell was still ringing in my brain, silence had re-established its empire, and only the rustle of the redescending birds and the boom of the distant surges disturbed the languor of the afternoon."
"汤姆听见那声音后惊跳了起来，仿佛是给马刺踢了一下的马。但是西尔弗连眼睛都没眨一下。他仍站在原地。轻轻靠在拐杖上，像条随时准备窜起来进攻的毒蛇一样看着他的同伴。","Tom had leaped at the sound, like a horse at the spur, but Silver had not winked an eye.He stood where he was, resting lightly on his crutch, watching his companion like a snake about to spring."
"“约翰！”另一位水手说，同时伸出他的手。","“John!” said the sailor, stretching out his hand."
"“住手！”西尔弗说，向后退了一码，在我看来，敏捷平稳得就如一位受过良好训练的体操运动员。","“Hands off!” cried Silver, leaping back a yard, as it seemed to me, with the speed and security of a trained gymnast."
"“如果你愿意，我就住手，约翰·西尔弗。”另一位说，“你良心有愧，所以才怕我。但是，看在上帝的份上，告诉我，那边是怎么了？”","“Hands off, if you like, John Silver,” said the other.“It’s a black conscience that can make you feared of me.But in heaven’s name, tell me, what was that?”"
"“那边？”西尔弗笑着回答说，但是神态更为戒备。他的眼睛在大脸上不过针尖大小，但却像一小块玻璃一样闪着光。“那边？哦，我想那是艾伦吧。”","“That?” returned Silver, smiling away, but warier than ever, his eye a mere pin-point in his big face, but gleaming like a crumb of glass.“That? Oh, I reckon that’ll be Alan.”"
"这时汤姆像个英雄似的振奋起来了。","And at this point Tom flashed out like a hero."
"“艾伦！”他叫道，“愿他这正直的海员灵魂安息！至于你，约翰·西尔弗，你做了我很久的伙伴，但你再也不是了。即使我死得像条狗，我也要死在自己的岗位上。你已经杀了艾伦，不是吗？如果你可以，也杀了我吧。但我谅你也不敢。”","“Alan!” he cried.“Then rest his soul for a true seaman!And as for you, John Silver, long you’ve been a mate of mine, but you’re mate of mine no more.If I die like a dog, I’ll die in my dooty.You’ve killed Alan, have you?Kill me too, if you can.But I defies you.”"
"说完，这个勇敢的人转过身，背对着厨子，向沙滩走去。但是注定他走不远。约翰大叫一声，拽住一根树枝，从胳膊底下抽出拐杖，猛地掷了出去。这粗糙的导弹在空中飞过，发出呼呼的声音。拐杖尖头朝前，击中了可怜的汤姆，正中两肩之间，力量大得能把人打晕。他向上伸出双手，发出叹息似的一声，倒下了。","And with that, this brave fellow turned his back directly on the cook and set off walking for the beach.But he was not destined to go far.With a cry John seized the branch of a tree, whipped the crutch out of his armpit, and sent that uncouth missile hurtling through the air.It struck poor Tom, point foremost, and with stunning violence, right between the shoulders in the middle of his back.His hands flew up, he gave a sort of gasp, and fell."
"他伤势如何，没人知道。从声音判断，他的脊背可能被当场击断了。但是约翰没给他时间恢复知觉。就算没了腿和拐杖，西尔弗也敏捷得像只猴子，一眨眼就跳到汤姆身上，把刀两次刺进这个毫无抵抗力的身体，只露出刀柄在外面。从蹲伏的地方，我可以听到他捅刀子时大声地喘着气。","Whether he were injured much or little, none could ever tell.Like enough, to judge from the sound, his back was broken on the spot.But he had no time given him to recover.Silver, agile as a monkey even without leg or crutch, was on the top of him next moment and had twice buried his knife up to the hilt in that defenceless body.From my place of ambush, I could hear him pant aloud as he struck the blows."
"我不知道晕眩是怎么样的，但是我知道，在接下来很短的一段时间里，整个世界仿佛在一团旋转的迷雾中离我远去了；西尔弗、鸟群、高高的望远镜山顶峰，都在我眼前颠来倒去地转着圈。耳边也一时万钟齐鸣，还有远处的喊声。","I do not know what it rightly is to faint, but I do know that for the next little while the whole world swam away from before me in a whirling mist; Silver and the birds, and the tall Spy-glass hilltop, going round and round and topsy-turvy before my eyes, and all manner of bells ringing and distant voices shouting in my ear."
"当我回过神来，那个魔鬼已经恢复了常态，拐杖拄在肋下，帽子戴在头上。就在他跟前，汤姆躺在草地上，一动不动；但是这个杀人犯看也不看一眼，只是拿一束草擦着他那沾上血的刀。一切如初，阳光依旧无情地照在水汽升腾的沼泽和高高的峰顶上，我仍然很难让自己相信，一起谋杀案已经在我眼前发生；顷刻间，一条生命就这样被残忍地谋害了。","When I came again to myself the monster had pulled himself together, his crutch under his arm, his hat upon his head.Just before him Tom lay motionless upon the sward; but the murderer minded him not a whit, cleansing his blood-stained knife the while upon a wisp of grass.Everything else was unchanged, the sun still shining mercilessly on the steaming marsh and the tall pinnacle of the mountain, and I could scarce persuade myself that murder had been actually done and a human life cruelly cut short a moment since before my eyes."
"现在，约翰把手插在口袋里，拿出哨子，吹了几个不同的调子，声音在燥热的空气中传得很远。当然，我不知道这信号的含义，但这立刻使我害怕起来。还有更多的人要来。我可能会被发现。他们已经残忍地杀害了两个忠实的人了；在汤姆和艾伦之后，会不会就轮到我了？","But now John put his hand into his pocket, brought out a whistle, and blew upon it several modulated blasts that rang far across the heated air.I could not tell, of course, the meaning of the signal, but it instantly awoke my fears.More men would be coming.I might be discovered.They had already slain two of the honest people; after Tom and Alan, might not I come next?"
"我立刻开始逃命，往回爬去：尽量不发出声音，以最快的速度爬向树林里更空旷的地方。正当我爬着，我听见老海盗和他的同伙们互相打着招呼，这预示着危险的声音让我像长了翅膀似的飞快爬着。一爬出灌木丛，我就以前所未有的速度向前跑去，几乎没注意我逃跑的方向，只要是能远离那群杀人凶手就行；跑着跑着，我越来越害怕，这害怕最后变成了一种狂乱。","Instantly I began to extricate myself and crawl back again, with what speed and silence I could manage, to the more open portion of the wood.As I did so, I could hear hails coming and going between the old buccaneer and his comrades, and this sound of danger lent me wings.As soon as I was clear of the thicket, I ran as I never ran before, scarce minding the direction of my flight, so long as it led me from the murderers; and as I ran, fear grew and grew upon me until it turned into a kind of frenzy."
"的确，还有人能比我更加不知所措吗？当通知返回大船的枪声响起时，我怎么敢和这群身上还沾着血腥的恶魔一起坐上小船？他们中第一个看见我的难道不会拧断我的脖子，就跟拧断沙滩鸟的脖子似的？但是如果我不去，他们不正好得到了证据，知道我已经有所警觉、了解内情了？一切都完了，我想。再见了，伊斯帕尼奥拉号；再见了，乡绅、医生和船长！我已别无选择，要么饿死，要么死在这群杀人犯的手上。","Indeed, could anyone be more entirely lost than I?When the gun fired, how should I dare to go down to the boats among those fiends, still smoking from their crime?Would not the first of them who saw me wring my neck like a snipe’s?Would not my absence itself be an evidence to them of my alarm, and therefore of my fatal knowledge?It was all over, I thought.Good-bye to the HISPANIOLA; good-bye to the squire, the doctor, and the captain!There was nothing left for me but death by starvation or death by the hands of the mutineers."
"这时，正像我说的，我仍在跑着，没注意到自己来到了那座双峰小山的山脚下，来到了岛上这样一个地方：在这里，长生橡树彼此的间隔更宽，从形态和面积来看，更像是林木。一些松树散落在橡树丛中，有的五十英尺高，有的则接近七十英尺。这里的空气也要比下面沼泽地附近的空气闻起来新鲜得多。","All this while, as I say, I was still running, and without taking any notice, I had drawn near to the foot of the little hill with the two peaks and had got into a part of the island where the live-oaks grew more widely apart and seemed more like forest trees in their bearing and dimensions.Mingled with these were a few scattered pines, some fifty, some nearer seventy, feet high.The air too smelt more freshly than down beside the marsh."
"在这里，一种新的危险把我惊呆了，我的心咚咚直跳。","And here a fresh alarm brought me to a standstill with a thumping heart."
"第十五章 岛上的人","Chapter 15 The Man of the Island   "
"从小山陡峭多石的这一侧滚下一堆碎石，簌簌地穿过树木落下。我本能地将目光转向那里，看见一个身影在松树树干后面飞快地跳跃着。那是什么，是熊，是人，还是猴子？我一点儿也说不上来。它看起来浑身黝黑，毛发蓬乱；其他的我就不知道了。但是这个突如其来的可怕的新东西把我吓得站住了。","From the side of the hill, which was here steep and stony, a spout of gravel was dislodged and fell rattling and bounding through the trees.My eyes turned instinctively in that direction, and I saw a figure leap with great rapidity behind the trunk of a pine.What it was, whether bear or man or monkey, I could in no wise tell.It seemed dark and shaggy; more I knew not.But the terror of this new apparition brought me to a stand."
"现在，我似乎进退两难了；我身后是杀人犯，而前面埋伏着这个莫可名状的东西。我立刻意识到，与这未知的危险比起来，我倒宁愿接受那已知的危险。相比这个林间怪物，西尔弗看上去不那么恐怖了。我转过身去，一边警惕地扭头注意背后的动静，一边开始原路返回，向小船走去。","I was now, it seemed, cut off upon both sides; behind me the murderers, before me this lurking nondescript.And immediately I began to prefer the dangers that I knew to those I knew not.Silver himself appeared less terrible in contrast with this creature of the woods, and I turned on my heel, and looking sharply behind me over my shoulder, began to retrace my steps in the direction of the boats."
"过了不久，那怪物又出现了，绕了一个大圈子，开始拦在了我前面。无论如何，我累了；但是即使我像刚起身时那样活力充沛，我也知道，跟这样的对手比赛快慢，也只是徒劳。它像只鹿似的在树干间穿梭，像人一样用两条腿奔跑，但是我从没见过有人跑步时腰弯得像它这样低。但是这确实是个人，我对此不再存疑。","Instantly the figure reappeared, and making a wide circuit, began to head me off.I was tired, at any rate; but had I been as fresh as when I rose, I could see it was in vain for me to contend in speed with such an adversary.From trunk to trunk the creature flitted like a deer, running manlike on two legs, but unlike any man that I had ever seen, stooping almost double as it ran.Yet a man it was, I could no longer be in doubt about that."
"我开始回想起听说过的关于食人族的故事。我差一点儿就要喊救命了。但是，无论他怎样野蛮，总还是个人，这一点使我稍稍放心，而我对西尔弗的恐惧又重新升起。因此，我站定下来，努力想找到逃生的办法；正当这样想着，我忽然记起我身上还带着把手枪。我一想起自己并不是毫无抵抗力的，心里就又涌起一股勇气，我坚定地面对着这个岛上的人，轻快地向他走去。","I began to recall what I had heard of cannibals.I was within an ace of calling for help.But the mere fact that he was a man, however wild, had somewhat reassured me, and my fear of Silver began to revive in proportion.I stood still, therefore, and cast about for some method of escape; and as I was so thinking, the recollection of my pistol flashed into my mind.As soon as I remembered I was not defenceless, courage glowed again in my heart and I set my face resolutely for this man of the island and walked briskly towards him."
"这次他却在另一棵树后藏了起来；但他一定还在仔细观察我，因为我一开始向他的方向走去，他就走了出来，上前一步来见我。接着他又犹豫了，往后退去，然后又走上前来；最终，令我惊奇而又不解的是，他竟扑通一声跪下，伸出双手，十指交叉，一副恳求的样子。","He was concealed by this time behind another tree trunk; but he must have been watching me closely, for as soon as I began to move in his direction he reappeared and took a step to meet me.Then he hesitated, drew back, came forward again, and at last, to my wonder and confusion, threw himself on his knees and held out his clasped hands in supplication."
"看到这情景，我又一次停了下来。","At that I once more stopped."
"“你是谁？”我问道。","“Who are you?” I asked."
"“本·冈恩。”他回答道，他的声音听上去粗哑生硬，像把生了锈的锁。“我是可怜的本·冈恩，是我；我已经有三年没和人说过话了。”","“Ben Gunn,” he answered, and his voice sounded hoarse and awkward, like a rusty lock.“I’m poor Ben Gunn, I am; and I haven’t spoke with a Christian these three years.”"
"这时我看出他和我一样是个白人，面貌还算清秀。他裸露在外的皮肤都被太阳晒黑了，甚至嘴唇也是黑的。在这样一张黑脸上，他那双美丽的眼睛显得格外明亮。在我看过或想象过的所有乞丐中，这个人绝对是最破衣烂衫的。他穿着用船上旧帆布和旧防水布的碎布条拼成的衣服，这件不同寻常的杂布衣服是由一系列各种各样、互不协调的连接物拼凑成的：铜纽扣、小树枝，以及涂了柏油的束帆索环。他在腰部系了一条旧的带铜扣的皮腰带，这是他全身上下最结实的一件东西了。","I could now see that he was a white man like myself and that his features were even pleasing.His skin, wherever it was exposed, was burnt by the sun; even his lips were black, and his fair eyes looked quite startling in so dark a face.Of all the beggar-men that I had seen or fancied, he was the chief for raggedness.He was clothed with tatters of old ship’s canvas and old sea-cloth, and this extraordinary patchwork was all held together by a system of the most various and incongruous fastenings, brass buttons, bits of stick, and loops of tarry gaskin.About his waist he wore an old brass-buckled leather belt, which was the one thing solid in his whole accoutrement."
"“三年！”我惊叫道，“是遭遇海难了吗？”","“Three years!” I cried.“Were you shipwrecked?”"
"“不，伙计，”他说，“是被流放了。”","“Nay, mate,” said he; “marooned.”"
"我以前听过这个词，我知道这代表着一种海盗们习以为常的可怕的惩罚方式。受罚者只带着一点弹药，便被丢在遥远的荒岛上。","I had heard the word, and I knew it stood for a horrible kind of punishment common enough among the buccaneers, in which the offender is put ashore with a little powder and shot and left behind on some desolate and distant island."
"“三年前被流放了，”他继续说，“之后就靠吃山羊、浆果和牡蛎过活。我想，无论一个人在哪儿，他总要自求生存。但是，伙计，我心里极度想要吃一顿文明人的饭。你是否身上碰巧带了一块奶酪？没有吗？唉，多少个漫长的晚上，我都梦见奶酪——多半是烤好的——然后醒来发现自己还是在这儿。”","“Marooned three years agone,” he continued, “and lived on goats since then, and berries, and oysters.Wherever a man is, says I, a man can do for himself.But, mate, my heart is sore for Christian diet.You mightn’t happen to have a piece of cheese about you, now?No?Well, many’s the long night I’ve dreamed of cheese-toasted, mostly—and woke up again, and here I were.”"
"“如果我还能再上大船的话，”我说，“你想吃多少奶酪就有多少。”","“If ever I can get aboard again,” said I, “you shall have cheese by the stone.”"
"说话期间，他一直在抚摸着我外套的料子，摸着我的手，看着我的靴子。基本上，在他说话的间隙，在一个人类同伴的面前，他都表现出一种孩子般的欢乐，但是在听到我最后一句话的时候，他忽然来了精神，露出一种吃惊和狡黠的神色。","All this time he had been feeling the stuff of my jacket, smoothing my hands, looking at my boots, and generally, in the intervals of his speech, showing a childish pleasure in the presence of a fellow creature.But at my last words he perked up into a kind of startled slyness."
"“你是说，如果你还能再上大船的话？”他重复着，“哎，谁在阻止你？”","“If ever you can get aboard again, says you?” he repeated.“Why, now, who’s to hinder you?”"
"“我知道，不是你。”我回答道。","“Not you, I know,” was my reply."
"“你说对了。”他叫道，“那么，你——你叫什么，伙计？”","“And right you was,” he cried.“Now you—what do you call yourself, mate?”"
"“吉姆。”我告诉他。","“Jim,” I told him."
"“吉姆，吉姆。”他说，显然非常高兴，“哎，吉姆，我过的苦日子你听了也会觉得不好意思呢。哎，比如说，看到我这个样子，你大概不会想到我有个虔诚笃信的母亲吧？”他问道。","“Jim, Jim,” said he, quite pleased apparently.“Well, now, Jim, I’ve lived that rough as you’d be ashamed to hear of.Now, for instance, you wouldn’t think I had had a pious mother—to look at me?” he asked."
"“哎，不，倒没怎么想到。”我回答说。","“Why, no, not in particular,” I answered."
"“啊，好吧，”他说，“但是我母亲确实虔诚。而我以前也是很文雅虔诚的男孩，能把教义问答背得非常快，你都听不清楚每个字。而我却是这个下场，吉姆，这都是从那该死的在墓石上的赌博开始的。就是从那时开始，但却越走越远；我母亲早就告诉过我，她全预测到了，那个虔诚的女人！是天意让我流放至此。在这孤岛上，我全想清楚了，现在又变得虔诚了。你不会再看到我大喝朗姆酒，不过只要有机会，为了祝好运喝那么一点还是可以的。我已决心要改过自新，我也找到了办法。而且，吉姆，”——他四周看了看，压低了声音说，“我很有钱。”","“Ah, well,” said he, “but I had remarkable pious.And I was a civil, pious boy, and could rattle off my catechism that fast, as you couldn’t tell one word from another.And here’s what it come to, Jim, and it begun with chuck-farthen on the blessed grave-stones!That’s what it begun with, but it went further’n that; and so my mother told me, and predicked the whole, she did, the pious woman!But it were Providence that put me here.I’ve thought it all out in this here lonely island, and I’m back on piety.You don’t catch me tasting rum so much, but just a thimbleful for luck, of course, the first chance I have.I’m bound I’ll be good, and I see the way to.And, Jim”—looking all round him and lowering his voice to a whisper—“I’m rich.”"
"现在我很肯定这可怜的人在孤独中已经发疯了，我觉得我一定是把这个想法流露在了脸上，因为他又激动地重复了一遍：“有钱！有钱！我跟你说。告诉你：吉姆，我要让你出人头地。啊，吉姆，你应该感谢命运，是的。你是我发现的第一个人！”","I now felt sure that the poor fellow had gone crazy in his solitude, and I suppose I must have shown the feeling in my face, for he repeated the statement hotly: “Rich!Rich!I says.And I’ll tell you what: I’ll make a man of you, Jim.Ah, Jim, you’ll bless your stars, you will, you was the first that found me!”"
"这时，他脸上闪过一丝阴影。他紧紧地抓住我的手，威胁般地伸出食指举在我眼前。","And at this there came suddenly a lowering shadow over his face, and he tightened his grasp upon my hand and raised a forefinger threateningly before my eyes."
"“哎，吉姆，告诉我实话：那是不是弗林特的船？”他问道。","“Now, Jim, you tell me true: that ain’t Flint’s ship?” he asked."
"听到这话，我喜出望外。我开始相信我找到了同盟，于是立刻回答他。","At this I had a happy inspiration.I began to believe that I had found an ally, and I answered him at once."
"“那不是弗林特的船，弗林特死了；但是，告诉你实话，正如你问我的，船上有一些弗林特的手下，对我们其他的人来说真是倒霉。”","“It’s not Flint’s ship, and Flint is dead; but I’ll tell you true, as you ask me—there are some of Flint’s hands aboard; worse luck for the rest of us.”"
"“有没有一个——只有一条腿的人？”他倒抽一口凉气。","“Not a man—with one-leg?”  he gasped."
"“西尔弗？”我问。","“Silver?”  I asked."
"“啊，西尔弗！”他说，“他就叫这个名字。”","“Ah, Silver!” said he.“That were his name.”"
"“他是厨子，还是叛徒首领。”","“He’s the cook, and the ringleader too.”"
"他仍抓着我的手腕，听到这话时他不自觉地拧了我手腕一下。","He was still holding me by the wrist, and at that he give it quite a wring."
"“如果你是高个子约翰派来的，”他说，“我早就死定了，我知道。但你觉得你们现在处境如何？”","“If you was sent by Long John,” he said, “I’m as good as pork, and I know it.But where was you, do you suppose?”"
"我立刻就打定了主意，把我们航行的整个经历以及我们现在的处境都告诉了他。他极其热切地听着我说。我说完后他拍了拍我的脑袋。","I had made my mind up in a moment, and by way of answer told him the whole story of our voyage and the predicament in which we found ourselves.He heard me with the keenest interest, and when I had done he patted me on the head."
"“你是个好孩子，吉姆，”他说，“但是你们都上了圈套，不是吗？好，你就相信本·冈恩吧——本·冈恩可以救你。你觉得这可不可能：要是我提供了帮助，你们的乡绅会不会慷慨大方地给予回报——他也上了圈套，就像你所说的？”","“You’re a good lad, Jim,” he said; “and you’re all in a clove hitch, ain’t you?Well, you just put your trust in Ben Gunn—Ben Gunn’s the man to do it.Would you think it likely, now, that your squire would prove a liberal-minded one in case of help—him being in a clove hitch, as you remark?”"
"我告诉他乡绅是最慷慨的人。","I told him the squire was the most liberal of men."
"“哎，但是你看，”本·冈恩说，“我不是指望着你们给我个穿着制服看门的工作，或其他什么的；那不是我想要的，吉姆。我指的是，他有没有可能愿意从那笔可以说已经到手的钱里拿出个——比方说一千磅——给我？”","“Aye, but you see,” returned Ben Gunn, “I didn’t mean giving me a gate to keep, and a suit of livery clothes, and such; that’s not my mark, Jim.What I mean is, would he be likely to come down to the toon of, say one thousand pounds out of money that’s as good as a man’s own already?”"
"“他肯定会的。”我说，“本来就该是这样，所有的人平分。”","“I am sure he would,” said I.“As it was, all hands were to share.”"
"“还带我返航？”他带着一种精明狡黠的神色补充道。","“And a passage home?”  he added with a look of great shrewdness."
"“哎，”我叫道，“乡绅可是位绅士。而且，如果我们除掉了那群人，我们还希望返航时你能在船上帮忙呢。”","“Why,” I cried, “the squire’s a gentleman.And besides, if we got rid of the others, we should want you to help work the vessel home.”"
"“啊，”他说，“你们会这么做的。”他看起来这才放了心。","“Ah,” said he, “so you would.”And he seemed very much relieved."
"第十六章 医生继续讲述：弃船的经过","Chapter 16 Narrative Continued by the Doctor: How the Ship Was Abandoned  "
"大约是在一点半钟——用海上的行话说是钟敲三下的时候——有两只小船从伊斯帕尼奥拉号启程上岸。船长、乡绅和我正在特舱里讨论对策。要是有一丝风的话，我们就可以向和我们一起留在船上的六个人发起突然攻击，然后起锚出海了。但是，一点风都没有；更让我们感到无能为力的是，亨特下来报告说吉姆·霍金斯溜上了一艘小船，和其他人一起上岸了。","It was about half past one—three bells in the sea phrase—that the two boats went ashore from the HISPANIOLA.The captain, the squire, and I were talking matters over in the cabin.Had there been a breath of wind, we should have fallen on the six mutineers who were left aboard with us, slipped our cable, and away to sea.But the wind was wanting; and to complete our helplessness, down came Hunter with the news that Jim Hawkins had slipped into a boat and was gone ashore with the rest."
"我们从来没想过要怀疑霍金斯，不过我们很为他的安全担心。跟一帮那种性情的人呆在一起，看起来我们很难再见到这孩子了。我们跑到甲板上。沥青在船缝里冒着泡；这地方有种令人讨厌的臭味，让我觉得恶心；如果有谁闻到过热病和痢疾的味道，一定就是在这个可恶的停泊处了。那六个无赖正坐在帆下的水手舱里，低声抱怨着；我们可以看见小船都系在岸边，一条船上坐着一个人，就在小河入海处。其中一人正在用口哨吹着《利利布雷洛》的曲子。","It never occurred to us to doubt Jim Hawkins, but we were alarmed for his safety.With the men in the temper they were in, it seemed an even chance if we should see the lad again.We ran on deck.The pitch was bubbling in the seams; the nasty stench of the place turned me sick; if ever a man smelt fever and dysentery, it was in that abominable anchorage.The six scoundrels were sitting grumbling under a sail in the forecastle; ashore we could see the gigs made fast and a man sitting in each, hard by where the river runs in.One of them was whistling “Lillibullero.”"
"等待让人紧张，于是我们决定让亨特和我也乘小艇上岸，打探情况。那些小船停在右边，而亨特和我则径直向着地图上标出栅栏的地方划去。留下看守小船的两个人看到我们出现，似乎有些慌了；《利利布雷洛》的曲子也停了下来，我看见他们两个讨论着应该怎么办。要是他们跑去告诉了西尔弗，一切都会大不一样；但是我猜他们是得了指令，所以决定继续安静地坐着，重又吹起了《利利布雷洛》。","Waiting was a strain, and it was decided that Hunter and I should go ashore with the jolly-boat in quest of information.The gigs had leaned to their right, but Hunter and I pulled straight in, in the direction of the stockade upon the chart.The two who were left guarding their boats seemed in a bustle at our appearance; “Lillibullero”stopped off, and I could see the pair discussing what they ought to do.Had they gone and told Silver, all might have turned out differently; but they had their orders, I suppose, and decided to sit quietly where they were and hark back again to “Lillibullero.”"
"海岸线上有个小小的拐角，我划着小艇，让这个拐角正处在我们和他们之间；这样在上岸之前，我们都看不见小船了。为了凉快，我在帽子底下放了块丝绸手帕；为了安全，我还给两支手枪装好了弹药。然后我跳出小艇，以接近奔跑的速度前进。","There was a slight bend in the coast, and I steered so as to put it between us; even before we landed we had thus lost sight of the gigs.I jumped out and came as near running as I durst, with a big silk handkerchief under my hat for coolness’ sake and a brace of pistols ready primed for safety."
"还没走上一百码，我就来到了栅栏前。","I had not gone a hundred yards when I reached the stockade."
"它就是这样的：一个小土丘顶上涌出一股清泉。这样，他们在这小土丘上围着泉水造了一间坚固的木头房子，一次可以容纳下四十个人，四壁上都是弹孔。他们在这周围清理出一片宽阔的空地，然后用六英尺高的栅栏围了起来，栅栏上没有门，也没有开口，十分坚固，不费点时间和力气很难拆毁，而且周围开阔得让进攻者无处可躲。在木屋里的人则占尽便宜；他们悄然躲在隐蔽处，把进攻者当鹧鸪似的射击。他们所需要的就是机敏的看守和充足的食物；因为，只要不是极其突然的袭击，他们可以守着这个地方对抗一个团的进攻。","This was how it was: a spring of clear water rose almost at the top of a knoll.Well, on the knoll, and enclosing the spring, they had clapped a stout loghouse fit to hold two score of people on a pinch and loopholed for musketry on either side.All round this they had cleared a wide space, and then the thing was completed by a paling six feet high, without door or opening, too strong to pull down without time and labour and too open to shelter the besiegers.The people in the log-house had them in every way; they stood quiet in shelter and shot the others like partridges.All they wanted was a good watch and food; for, short of a complete surprise, they might have held the place against a regiment."
"特别吸引我的是那眼泉水。因为我们虽然在伊斯帕尼奥拉号的特舱里过着舒坦的日子，武器和弹药都很充足，还有食物和美酒，但是我们忽略了一件事——我们没有淡水。正当我想着这件事时，岛上传来一个人临死前的一声惨叫。我对暴死并不陌生——我曾在坎伯兰公爵殿下的手下服过役，而我自己也在丰特努瓦战役中负了伤——但是我的脉搏还是加快起来。“吉姆·霍金斯死了。”这是我的第一反应。","What particularly took my fancy was the spring.For though we had a good enough place of it in the cabin of the HISPANIOLA, with plenty of arms and ammunition, and things to eat, and excellent wines, there had been one thing overlooked—we had no water.I was thinking this over when there came ringing over the island the cry of a man at the point of death.I was not new to violent death—I have served his Royal Highness the Duke of Cumberland, and got a wound myself at Fontenoy—but I know my pulse went dot and carry one.“Jim Hawkins is gone,” was my first thought."
"做一个老兵很不简单，而做一个医生就更不简单了。我们的工作容不得片刻拖延。因此我立刻下定决心，毫不犹豫地回到岸边，跳上小艇。","It is something to have been an old soldier, but more still to have been a doctor.There is no time to dilly-dally in our work.And so now I made up my mind instantly, and with no time lost returned to the shore and jumped on board the jolly boat."
"幸亏亨特划得一手好船。我们在水上行驶如飞，小艇很快靠近大船，我随即登上了大船。","By good fortune Hunter pulled a good oar.We made the water fly, and the boat was soon alongside and I aboard the schooner."
"我发现他们都在颤抖，这是自然的反应。乡绅坐在舱里，面如白纸，还在想着他给我们带来了多少伤害，这个善良的人！而水手舱的六个人中，有一个也和乡绅一样吓得够呛。","I found them all shaken, as was natural.The squire was sitting down, as white as a sheet, thinking of the harm he had led us to, the good soul!And one of the six forecastle hands was little better."
"“那个人，”斯莫利特船长向他点点头说，“还是第一次经历这种事。他听到惨叫声时，都快晕倒了，医生。我们再给他施加点影响，他就会加入我们的。”","“There’s a man,” said Captain Smollett, nodding towards him, “new to this work.He came nigh-hand fainting, doctor, when he heard the cry.Another touch of the rudder and that man would join us.”"
"我对船长说了我的计划，我们之间订好了实施的细节。","I told my plan to the captain, and between us we settled on the details of its accomplishment."
"我们让雷德鲁斯带上三四把装满弹药的滑膛枪和一块防护垫，守在特舱和水手舱之间的走道里。亨特把小艇划到后舷窗处，乔伊斯和我开始把火药桶、滑膛枪、一袋袋的饼干，一桶桶的腌猪肉、一桶白兰地酒，以及我那珍贵的医药箱一起装上船。","We put old Redruth in the gallery between the cabin and the forecastle, with three or four loaded muskets and a mattress for protection.Hunter brought the boat round under the stern-port, and Joyce and I set to work loading her with powder tins, muskets, bags of biscuits, kegs of pork, a cask of cognac, and my invaluable medicine chest."
"同时，乡绅和船长呆在甲板上。船长在跟舵手打着招呼，舵手是船上那帮人的领头人物。","In the meantime, the squire and the captain stayed on deck, and the latter hailed the coxswain, who was the principal man aboard."
"“汉兹先生，”船长说，“乡绅和我两个人每人都有两把手枪。要是你们六个中有谁发出任何一种信号，他就死定了。”","“Mr. Hands,” he said, “here are two of us with a brace of pistols each.If any one of you six make a signal of any description, that man’s dead.”"
"他们大吃一惊，讨论了一小会之后，所有人都冲下前舱梯，无疑是想从后面包围我们。但是一看到雷德鲁斯正在设了防的厨房里等着他们，他们又立刻向别处跑去，一个脑袋伸上了甲板。","They were a good deal taken aback, and after a little consultation one and all tumbled down the fore companion, thinking no doubt to take us on the rear.But when they saw Redruth waiting for them in the sparred galley, they went about ship at once, and a head popped out again on deck."
"“下去，狗东西！”船长叫道。","“Down, dog!” cried the captain."
"那个脑袋又缩了回去；然后，有一段时间，我们再没听到这六个吓破了胆的水手有什么动静。","And the head popped back again; and we heard no more, for the time, of these six very faint-hearted seamen."
"这时，我们已经把搬来的东西尽可能多地装上了小船，直到再也不敢多装为止。乔伊斯和我从后舷窗钻出来上了小艇，然后我们又尽快地向岸边划去。","By this time, tumbling things in as they came, we had the jolly boat loaded as much as we dared.Joyce and I got out through the stern port, and we made for shore again as fast as oars could take us."
"这第二趟着实让岸边的看守起了疑心。《利利布雷洛》又一次停了下来，就在我们进入拐角、从他们视野中消失之前，他们其中一个飞跑上岸，一会就不见人影了。我本想改变计划、毁掉他们的小船，但是我害怕西尔弗和其他人有可能就在附近，这么做会让一切前功尽弃。","This second trip fairly aroused the watchers along shore.“Lillibullero” was dropped again; and just before we lost sight of them behind the little point, one of them whipped ashore and disappeared.I had half a mind to change my plan and destroy their boats, but I feared that Silver and the others might be close at hand, and all might very well be lost by trying for too much."
"我们又一次在同一地点上了岸，开始往木屋搬运物资。第一趟，我们三个都去了，背了很多东西。我们把东西扔在栅栏那儿。然后，我们让乔伊斯留在那儿看守东西——一个人，但是带了半打滑膛枪——亨特和我则回到小艇，再次背上东西向木屋走去。我们就这样进行着，都没停下来喘口气，直到整船的东西都安置好了。两个仆人留守在木屋里，而我则使出全身力气划着小艇回到了伊斯帕尼奥拉号。","We had soon touched land in the same place as before and set to provision the block house.All three made the first journey, heavily laden, and tossed our stores over the palisade.Then, leaving Joyce to guard them—one man, to be sure, but with half a dozen muskets—Hunter and I returned to the jolly boat and loaded ourselves once more.So we proceeded without pausing to take breath, till the whole cargo was bestowed, when the two servants took up their position in the block house, and I, with all my power, sculled back to the HISPANIOLA."
"我们准备再冒一次险把小艇装满，这看起来很危险，其实不然。当然，他们人数占优，但是我们的武器更多。岸上的人并不是人手都有一把滑膛枪的。不是自夸，我们在进入他们手枪射程内之前，也至少能够解决掉半打人。","That we should have risked a second boat load seems more daring than it really was.They had the advantage of numbers, of course, but we had the advantage of arms.Not one of the men ashore had a musket, and before they could get within range for pistol shooting, we flattered ourselves we should be able to give a good account of a half-dozen at least."
"乡绅坐在船尾的窗前等着我，一扫刚才那种沮丧的神情。他抓住缆绳，把小船系紧，我们又开始拼命往船上装东西。货物包括猪肉、弹药以及饼干，我们仅仅给乡绅、我、雷德鲁斯和船长每人带了一支滑膛枪和一把弯刀。我们把剩下的武器和弹药都沉在两英寻半深的水里了，可以看见在我们下方深处，干净的沙底上，雪亮的钢铁在阳光下闪闪发光。","The squire was waiting for me at the stern window, all his faintness gone from him.He caught the painter and made it fast, and we fell to loading the boat for our very lives.Pork, powder, and biscuit was the cargo, with only a musket and a cutlass apiece for the squire and me and Redruth and the captain.The rest of the arms and powder we dropped overboard in two fathoms and a half of water, so that we could see the bright steel shining far below us in the sun, on the clean, sandy bottom."
"这时，海水退潮了，船在抛锚处打着转。从两艘小船的方向可以隐约听见相互招呼的声音；虽然这让我们不必再为安守在东边的乔伊斯和亨特担心，这也警告着我们必须要走了。","By this time the tide was beginning to ebb, and the ship was swinging round to her anchor.Voices were heard faintly halloaing in the direction of the two gigs; and though this reassured us for Joyce and Hunter, who were well to the eastward, it warned our party to be off."
"雷德鲁斯从他在走道的位置上撤下，上了小艇，然后我们把小艇划到船的另一边，方便斯莫利特船长上船。","Redruth retreated from his place in the gallery and dropped into the boat, which we then brought round to the ship’s counter, to be handier for Captain Smollett."
"“喂，你们这帮家伙，”他说，“听见我说话了吗？”","“Now, men,” said he, “do you hear me?”"
"水手舱里没有回答。","There was no answer from the forecastle."
"“我对你说话，亚伯拉罕·格雷——我在对你说话。”","“It’s to you, Abraham Gray—it’s to you I am speaking.”"
"仍旧没有回应。“格雷，”斯莫利特船长提高了声音接着说，“我就要离开这条船了，我命令你跟着你的船长一起走。我知道你本质上是个好人，我敢说你们这群人中没有谁像表面上看起来的那样坏。我手里有只表；我给你们三十秒的时间来加入我们这一边。”","Still no reply.“Gray,” resumed Mr. Smollett, a little louder, “I am leaving this ship, and I order you to follow your captain.I know you are a good man at bottom, and I dare say not one of the lot of you’s as bad as he makes out.I have my watch here in my hand; I give you thirty seconds to join me in.”"
"接着是一阵沉默。","There was a pause."
"“来吧，我的好伙计，”船长继续说道，“别再耽搁太久了。每一秒钟，我和其他善良的绅士们都在冒着生命危险。”","“Come, my fine fellow,” continued the captain; “don’t hang so long in stays.I’m risking my life and the lives of these good gentlemen every second.”"
"忽然，舱里传来一阵扭打声，亚伯拉罕·格雷脸颊上带着一条刀伤冲了出来，他跑向船长，就像狗听到了哨声一样。","There was a sudden scuffle, a sound of blows, and out burst Abraham Gray with a knife cut on the side of the cheek, and came running to the captain like a dog to the whistle."
"“我和你去，先生。”他说。","“I’m with you, sir,” said he."
"一眨眼功夫，他和船长就下到了小艇上，我们立刻离开大船，向岸边划去。","And the next moment he and the captain had dropped aboard of us, and we had shoved off and given way."
"我们已经完全脱离了大船，但是还没上岸到达栅栏处。","We were clear out of the ship, but not yet ashore in our stockade."
"第十七章 医生继续讲述：小艇的最后一次行驶","Chapter 17 Narrative Continued by the Doctor: The Jolly-boat’s Last Trip  "
"小艇的第五次行驶与前几次完全不同。首先，这艘小艇只有药罐一般大小，现在已经完全超载了。船上有五个成年人，其中的三个——特里劳尼、雷德鲁斯和船长——身高全都超过六英尺，这已经远远超过了小艇的承载能力。除此之外还有弹药、猪肉和面包袋。船尾的弦边几乎已经跟水面齐平了。有好几次，船都进了一点水。还没走到一百码，我的裤子和外套下摆就都湿透了。","This fifth trip was quite different from any of the others.In the first place, the little gallipot of a boat that we were in was gravely overloaded.Five grown men, and three of them—Trelawney, Redruth, and the captain—over six feet high, was already more than she was meant to carry.Add to that the powder, pork, and bread-bags.The gunwale was lipping astern.Several times we shipped a little water, and my breeches and the tails of my coat were all soaking wet before we had gone a hundred yards."
"船长让我们把船上东西的位置调整了一下，这样船就稍微平稳一些。尽管如此，我们还是连大气都不敢喘。","The captain made us trim the boat, and we got her to lie a little more evenly.All the same, we were afraid to breathe."
"而且，我们赶上了退潮——一道微波起伏的湍流正经过港湾向西流去，再穿过我们早上走过的海峡，向南流入大海。对于我们超重的小船来说，即使是细微的波浪也很危险。然而最糟糕的是，我们因此偏离了航道，离拐角后面那个既定的登陆地点越来越远了。如果我们还顺着湍流走，那我们就得从系在岸边的小船旁边上岸，而海盗们随时有可能在那里出现。","In the second place, the ebb was now making—a strong rippling current running westward through the basin, and then south’ard and seaward down the straits by which we had entered in the morning.Even the ripples were a danger to our overloaded craft, but the worst of it was that we were swept out of our true course and away from our proper landing-place behind the point.If we let the current have its way we should come ashore beside the gigs, where the pirates might appear at any moment."
"“我没办法让小艇向着栅栏的方向行驶，先生。”我对船长说。我在掌舵，而他和雷德鲁斯在划船，他们俩还没有消耗什么体力。“潮水总是把船往下冲。你们能不能再使点劲儿？”","“I cannot keep her head for the stockade, sir,” said I to the captain.I was steering, while he and Redruth, two fresh men, were at the oars.“The tide keeps washing her down.Could you pull a little stronger?”"
"“再用力船就要翻了。”他说，“你得顶住，先生，要是可以的话，直到你觉得已经成功了为止。”","“Not without swamping the boat,” said he.“You must bear up, sir, if you please—bear up until you see you’re gaining.”"
"我尝试着，经过试验，发现潮水一直在把我们向西边推，于是我让船头对着正东方向。但是这样一来，船头就正好与我们要去的方向垂直。","I tried and found by experiment that the tide kept sweeping us westward until I had laid her head due east, or just about right angles to the way we ought to go."
"“照这种速度下去，我们永远也上不了岸。”我说。","“We’ll never get ashore at this rate,” said I."
"“如果这是我们唯一的线路，先生，我们就必须照着它走。”船长回答道，“我们必须逆流而上。你瞧，先生，”他继续说，“一旦我们给冲到了登陆点的下风处，那么除了在那两条小船的旁边，很难说我们还能在哪里上岸了；然而，照我们现在的方向走，湍流是必然要减弱的，然后我们就可以沿着岸边退回来。”","“If it’s the only course that we can lie, sir, we must even lie it,” returned the captain.“We must keep upstream.You see, sir,” he went on, “if once we dropped to leeward of the landing-place, it’s hard to say where we should get ashore, besides the chance of being boarded by the gigs; whereas, the way we go the current must slacken, and then we can dodge back along the shore.”"
"“湍流已经减弱一些了，先生，”那个叫格雷的人说，他坐在小艇前部；“你可以稍微偏一点儿方向了。”","“The current’s less a’ready, sir,” said the man Gray, who was sitting in the fore-sheets; “you can ease her off a bit.”"
"“谢谢你，伙计，”我说，就跟什么都没发生似的，我们已经打定主意要把他当做自己人对待。","“Thank you, my man,” said I, quite as if nothing had happened, for we had all quietly made up our minds to treat him like one of ourselves."
"突然，船长又说话了，我觉得他的声音微微变了。","Suddenly the captain spoke up again, and I thought his voice was a little changed."
"“大炮！”他说。","“The gun!” said he."
"“我已经考虑到这个了。”我说，因为我认定他想到的是敌人可能炮击木屋。“他们没法把大炮弄上岸。即使成功了，也没法把它拖过树林。”","“I have thought of that,” said I, for I made sure he was thinking of a bombardment of the fort.“They could never get the gun ashore, and if they did, they could never haul it through the woods.”"
"“看后面，医生。”船长回答。","“Look astern, doctor,” replied the captain."
"我们已经完全忘记了“大雪茄”这回事；现在，令我们惊恐的是，那五个坏蛋正忙着脱去它的“外套”——他们是这么称呼覆盖大炮的厚防水油布的。不仅如此，这时我忽然想起，我们把大炮的火药和圆形炮弹都留在船上了，船上那些恶棍们只要拿斧子一劈，就能得到它们。","We had entirely forgotten the long nine; and there, to our horror, were the five rogues busy about her, getting off her jacket, as they called the stout tarpaulin cover under which she sailed.Not only that, but it flashed into my mind at the same moment that the round-shot and the powder for the gun had been left behind, and a stroke with an axe would put it all into the possession of the evil ones abroad."
"“伊斯雷尔是弗林特的炮手。”格雷声音沙哑着说。","“Israel was Flint’s gunner,” said Gray hoarsely."
"我们不顾一切地让船头直指登陆点。这时，我们已经远离了湍流的影响，只要以适当均匀的速度划着，就可以保持方向平稳，而我也能让船稳稳地向目标驶去。然而糟糕的是，照现在的航线行驶，我们不是船尾对着伊斯帕尼奥拉号，而是船舷，这样就给它提供了一个谷仓门一般大的目标。","At any risk, we put the boat’s head direct for the landing-place.By this time we had got so far out of the run of the current that we kept steerage way even at our necessarily gentle rate of rowing, and I could keep her steady for the goal.But the worst of it was that with the course I now held we turned our broadside instead of our stern to the HISPANIOLA and offered a target like a barn door."
"我能听见，同时也能看见，那个喝酒喝得脸通红的流氓伊斯雷尔·汉兹正往甲板上放圆形炮弹呢。","I could hear as well as see that brandy-faced rascal Israel Hands plumping down a round-shot on the deck."
"“谁是最好的枪手？”船长问。","“Who’s the best shot?” asked the captain."
"“特里劳尼先生，他是最棒的。”我说。","“Mr. Trelawney, out and away,” said I."
"“特里劳尼先生，能不能请你瞄准射击那群人里的一个，先生？要是可能的话，就是汉兹。”船长说。","“Mr. Trelawney, will you please pick me off one of these men, sir? Hands, if possible,” said the captain."
"特里劳尼像钢铁一般冷静。他看了看自己那支枪里的火药。","Trelawney was as cool as steel.He looked to the priming of his gun."
"“那么，”船长大喊，“开枪时动作不要太大，先生，不然船要沉了。在他瞄准时，所有人都站在一边，保持船身平衡。”","“Now,” cried the captain, “easy with that gun, sir, or you’ll swamp the boat.All hands stand by to trim her when he aims.”"
"乡绅举起了枪，船也不划了，我们都站到另外一边以保持平衡，一切都安排得很好，船没进一滴水。","The squire raised his gun, the rowing ceased, and we leaned over to the other side to keep the balance, and all was so nicely contrived that we did not ship a drop."
"这时，他们把大炮转了过来，汉兹拿着通条站在炮口，因此成了最为暴露的人。然而，我们运气不好，就在特里劳尼开枪的一瞬间，汉兹弯下腰来，子弹呼啸着从他头上飞过，打中了其余四人中的一个。","They had the gun, by this time, slewed round upon the swivel, and Hands, who was at the muzzle with the rammer, was in consequence the most exposed.However, we had no luck, for just as Trelawney fired, down he stooped, the ball whistled over him, and it was one of the other four who fell."
"他大叫一声，这不仅引得他船上的同伴都呼喊起来，连岸上也传来一阵叫嚷。我向那个方向看去，只见其他海盗正成队地从树林里出来，跌跌撞撞地上了小船。","The cry he gave was echoed not only by his companions on board but by a great number of voices from the shore, and looking in that direction I saw the other pirates trooping out from among the trees and tumbling into their places in the boats."
"“小船来了，先生。”我说。","“Here come the gigs, sir,” said I."
"“那就快划。”船长喊道，“现在我们不能担心船会不会翻了。要是我们上不了岸，一切就全完了。”","“Give way, then,” cried the captain.“We mustn’t mind if we swamp her now.If we can’t get ashore, all’s up.”"
"“只有一条小船上了人，先生。”我补充道，“另一条船上的人很可能要从岸上包抄阻截我们。”","“Only one of the gigs is being manned, sir,” I added; “the crew of the other most likely going round by shore to cut us off.”"
"“他们得跑上一阵，先生。”船长答道，“水手上了岸就不中用了。我担心的不是他们，而是那圆形炮弹。这简单得就像是在地毯上玩滚木球戏！连我妻子的女仆也能打中。乡绅，你要是看见他们点火就告诉我们，我们好停桨。”","“They’ll have a hot run, sir,” returned the captain.“Jack ashore, you know.It’s not them I mind; it’s the round shot.Carpet bowls!My lady’s maid couldn’t miss.Tell us, squire, when you see the match, and we’ll hold water.”"
"与此同时，我们在以不错的速度前进着，对于一艘这样超载的船来说已经很好了。而在这过程中，船只进了一点点水。我们渐渐接近岸边；只要再划三四十下就能到岸了，因为在潮水退去时，一条狭窄的沙地在繁茂的树丛中间显露了出来。现在不再需要担心海盗们的小船；那个小拐角已经将船挡在我们的视线之外了。落潮曾经无情地拖延了我们，现在则在做出补偿，拖延着进攻我们的海盗。此刻唯一的危险就是来自于大炮。","In the meanwhile we had been making headway at a good pace for a boat so overloaded, and we had shipped but little water in the process.We were now close in; thirty or forty strokes and we should beach her, for the ebb had already disclosed a narrow belt of sand below the clustering trees.The gig was no longer to be feared; the little point had already concealed it from our eyes.The ebb-tide, which had so cruelly delayed us, was now making reparation and delaying our assailants.The one source of danger was the gun."
"“要是可以，”船长说，“我会停下船再干掉一个人。”","“If I durst,” said the captain, “I’d stop and pick off another man.”"
"但是很显然，没有什么能够耽误他们开炮。他们对倒下的同伙连看也不看一眼，尽管他还没死，我能看见他试图爬到一边。","But it was plain that they meant nothing should delay their shot.They had never so much as looked at their fallen comrade, though he was not dead, and I could see him trying to crawl away."
"“准备！”乡绅喊道。","“Ready!” cried the squire."
"“停桨！”船长喊道，像回声一样及时。","“Hold!” cried the captain, quick as an echo."
"然后他和雷德鲁斯猛地倒桨一划，船尾都没到水下了。几乎与此同时，传来了爆炸声。这就是吉姆听到的第一声炮响，乡绅开枪的声音并没有传到他那儿。炮弹是从哪里飞过去的，我们谁也说不准，但我猜它一定是从我们头顶上过去的，它掀起的气浪给我们带来了灾难。","And he and Redruth backed with a great heave that sent her stern bodily under water.The report fell in at the same instant of time.This was the first that Jim heard, the sound of the squire’s shot not having reached him.Where the ball passed, not one of us precisely knew, but I fancy it must have been over our heads and that the wind of it may have contributed to our disaster."
"无论如何，船从尾部开始沉没，非常缓慢地沉到了三英尺深的水里，剩下我和船长面对面地站着。其他三个人都一头栽进水里，吐着气泡，又浑身湿透地浮上水面。","At any rate, the boat sank by the stern, quite gently, in three feet of water, leaving the captain and myself, facing each other, on our feet.The other three took complete headers, and came up again drenched and bubbling."
"目前为止我们还没有很大的损失。没有人牺牲，我们也能安全地涉水上岸。但是我们所有的储备都沉在水底了，而且更糟的是，五支枪中只剩两支还能使用。我当时本能地抓起放在双膝上的枪，并举过头顶。至于船长，他一直用子弹带把枪挎在肩上，枪机朝上——真是明智。其余三支枪都同小艇一起沉没了。","So far there was no great harm.No lives were lost, and we could wade ashore in safety.But there were all our stores at the bottom, and to make things worse, only two guns out of five remained in a state for service.Mine I had snatched from my knees and held over my head, by a sort of instinct.As for the captain, he had carried his over his shoulder by a bandoleer, and like a wise man, lock uppermost.The other three had gone down with the boat."
"令我们更加担心的是，我们听见从岸边树林里传来的声音越来越近了。以我们现在实力大损的状态来看，我们不仅面临着在去往栅栏的路上被阻截的危险，而且担心，在我们前面，若是亨特和乔伊斯遭到6个海盗的攻击，他们有没有坚守阵地的意志和能力。亨特是稳重可靠的，我们都知道这一点；但是乔伊斯就很难说了——作为一位仆人，他亲切有礼，刷刷衣服这类活也干得很好，但是当一名战士就并不是那么合适了。","To add to our concern, we heard voices already drawing near us in the woods along shore, and we had not only the danger of being cut off from the stockade in our half-crippled state but the fear before us whether, if Hunter and Joyce were attacked by half a dozen, they would have the sense and conduct to stand firm.Hunter was steady, that we knew; Joyce was a doubtful case—a pleasant, polite man for a valet and to brush one’s clothes, but not entirely fitted for a man of war."
"我们一边想着这些，一边尽可能快地趟水上岸，把可怜的小艇以及一大半的弹药和食品储备都抛在身后。","With all this in our minds, we waded ashore as fast as we could, leaving behind us the poor jolly boat and a good half of all our powder and provisions."

"我们以最快的速度穿过隔在我们和栅栏之间的一片狭长的树林。我们每跑一步，都能听到海盗们的声音又近了一点。不久，我们就听到他们奔跑的脚步声，以及他们冲过灌木丛时折断树枝的声音。","We made our best speed across the strip of wood that now divided us from the stockade, and at every step we took the voices of the buccaneers rang nearer.Soon we could hear their footfalls as they ran and the cracking of the branches as they breasted across a bit of thicket."
"我开始意识到一场鏖战在所难免，于是检查了一下我的枪膛。","I began to see we should have a brush for it in earnest and looked to my priming."
"“船长，”我说，“特里劳尼是个神枪手。把你的枪给他，他自己的不能用了。”","“Captain,” said I, “Trelawney is the dead shot.Give him your gun; his own is useless.”"
"他们互换了枪，特里劳尼从骚乱一开始就十分镇定而沉默。现在他稍停片刻，全面检查了一下他的武器是否合用。同时，我看到格雷手里没有枪，就把我的弯刀给了他。看到他往手里吐了口唾沫，眉头紧皱，将弯刀舞得呼呼作响，我们都打心眼里高兴。从他身上的各方面素质来看，很显然我们这个新伙计绝对称职。","They exchanged guns, and Trelawney, silent and cool as he had been since the beginning of the bustle, hung a moment on his heel to see that all was fit for service.At the same time, observing Gray to be unarmed, I handed him my cutlass.It did all our hearts good to see him spit in his hand, knit his brows, and make the blade sing through the air.It was plain from every line of his body that our new hand was worth his salt."
"我们又跑了四十步，来到了树林边，看见栅栏就在我们面前。我们从大约南边中部接近栅栏，几乎就在同时，以水手长乔布·安德森为首的七个叛徒大叫大嚷地出现在西南角。","Forty paces farther we came to the edge of the wood and saw the stockade in front of us.We struck the enclosure about the middle of the south side, and almost at the same time, seven mutineers—Job Anderson, the boatswain, at their head appeared in full cry at the southwestern corner."
"他们好像吃了一惊，停住脚步，在他们缓过神来之前，不光是乡绅和我，就连木屋里的亨特和乔伊斯也都有时间开枪。这四枪形成一阵凌乱的射击，但是却十分有效：有个敌人倒下了，其他人毫不迟疑地转身钻进了树林里。","They paused as if taken aback, and before they recovered, not only the squire and I, but Hunter and Joyce from the block house, had time to fire.The four shots came in rather a scattering volley, but they did the business: one of the enemy actually fell, and the rest, without hesitation, turned and plunged into the trees."
"给枪重新上了子弹之后，我们向下走出栅栏，查看那个倒下的敌人。他已经死了——子弹穿过了心脏。","After reloading, we walked down the outside of the palisade to see to the fallen enemy.He was stone dead—shot through the heart."
"我们正为成功而欢欣鼓舞的时候，灌木丛里传来一声枪响，一颗子弹擦着我耳边呼啸飞过，可怜的汤姆·雷德鲁斯一个趔趄，直直地躺在了地上。乡绅和我都开枪回击，但是因为我们看不见目标，这只是浪费弹药。然后我们又上了子弹，将注意力转向了可怜的汤姆。","We began to rejoice over our good success when just at that moment a pistol cracked in the bush, a ball whistled close past my ear, and poor Tom Redruth stumbled and fell his length on the ground.Both the squire and I returned the shot, but as we had nothing to aim at, it is probable we only wasted powder.Then we reloaded and turned our attention to poor Tom."
"船长和格雷已经在检查他的伤势，但我一眼就看出他已经没救了。","The captain and Gray were already examining him, and I saw with half an eye that all was over."
"我相信我们迅速的回击已经再一次迫使叛徒们散开了，因为在我们把可怜的老猎场看守人抬过栅栏、搬进木屋时，我们一直没有再受到骚扰；这一路上，他一直在呻吟着，血流不止。","I believe the readiness of our return volley had scattered the mutineers once more, for we were suffered without further molestation to get the poor old gamekeeper hoisted over the stockade and carried, groaning and bleeding, into the log-house."
"可怜的老家伙，自从我们遇到麻烦，一直到现在我们将他放在木屋的地上躺着等死，他都从没说过一句表现出惊讶、抱怨、恐惧甚至默认的话。他曾像个特洛伊人一样在防护垫后面守在走廊；他曾默默地执行过每一个命令，并总是不屈不挠地出色完成；他是我们这群人里年纪最大的，比我们年长二十岁；而现在，这个郁郁寡言的、年长的、忠实的仆人，他就要死了。","Poor old fellow, he had not uttered one word of surprise, complaint, fear, or even acquiescence from the very beginning of our troubles till now, when we had laid him down in the log-house to die.He had lain like a Trojan behind his mattress in the gallery; he had followed every order silently, doggedly, and well; he was the oldest of our party by a score of years; and now, sullen, old, serviceable servant, it was he that was to die."
"乡绅在他身边跪下，亲吻着他的手，哭得像个孩子。","The squire dropped down beside him on his knees and kissed his hand, crying like a child."
"“我要死了吗，医生？”他问道。","“Be I going, doctor?” he asked."
"“汤姆，我的伙计，”我说，“你要回家了。”","“Tom, my man,” said I, “you’re going home.”"
"“我真希望能先朝他们开几枪再走。”他回答说。","“I wish I had had a lick at them with the gun first,” he replied."
"“汤姆，”乡绅说，“说你原谅我，你愿意吗？”","“Tom,” said the squire, “say you forgive me, won’t you?”"
"“让我原谅你，乡绅，这不太恭敬吧？”他回答。“不管怎样，就这么着吧，阿门！”","“Would that be respectful like, from me to you, squire?” was the answer.“Howsoever, so be it, amen!”"
"沉默了一小会之后，他说他想让谁来做个祈祷。“这是习俗，先生。”他面带歉意地补充道。不久后，他再没说什么，死了。","After a little while of silence, he said he thought somebody might read a prayer.“It’s the custom, sir,” he added apologetically.And not long after, without another word, he passed away."
"我早就注意到船长的胸前和口袋都鼓鼓囊囊的，而就在这时，他从那里掏出一大堆各种各样的东西——英国国旗、一本《圣经》、一卷结实的绳子、钢笔、墨水、航海日志本，以及几磅烟草。他在栅栏内找到一棵被砍倒、削好了的、长长的枞树枝，在亨特的帮助下，他把树枝竖在木屋的一个角上，那角上树干交错，形成一个角度。然后，他又爬上屋顶，亲手拴好了国旗，将它升了起来。","In the meantime the captain, whom I had observed to be wonderfully swollen about the chest and pockets, had turned out a great many various stores—the British colours, a Bible, a coil of stoutish rope, pen, ink, the log-book, and pounds of tobacco.He had found a longish fir-tree lying felled and trimmed in the enclosure, and with the help of Hunter he had set it up at the corner of the log-house where the trunks crossed and made an angle.Then, climbing on the roof, he had with his own hand bent and run up the colours."
"这似乎让他大大地松了一口气。他又走进木屋，开始目无旁物地数起他的东西来。但他一直留意着汤姆的情况，汤姆一咽气，他就拿着另一面国旗走过来，恭敬地盖在汤姆的身体上。","This seemed mightily to relieve him.He re-entered the log-house and set about counting up the stores as if nothing else existed.But he had an eye on Tom’s passage for all that, and as soon as all was over, came forward with another flag and reverently spread it on the body."
"“别太难过了，先生。”他摇着乡绅的手说，“对他来说这一切很好；他是在履行对船长和船主的职责时死的，不要再觉得不安了。也许这不太合乎教义，但这是事实。”","“Don’t you take on, sir,” he said, shaking the squire’s hand.“All’s well with him; no fear for a hand that’s been shot down in his duty to captain and owner.It mayn’t be good divinity, but it’s a fact.”"
"他把我拉到一边。","Then he pulled me aside."
"“利夫西医生，”他说，“你和乡绅指望的那艘接应船还要几个星期才能到？”","“Mr. Livesey,” he said, “in how many weeks do you and squire expect the consort?”"
"我告诉他，不是几个星期，而是几个月；如果我们在八月底还没返航的话，就会派布兰德里来找我们，不会早也不会迟。“你可以自己算算。”我说。","I told him it was a question not of weeks but of months, that if we were not back by the end of August Blandly was to send to find us, but neither sooner nor later.“You can calculate for yourself,” I said."
"“哎，是啊，”船长搔搔头，回答说，“把天赐的这一切恩典都考虑在内，先生，我得说我们的处境还是非常不妙啊。”","“Why, yes,” returned the captain, scratching his head; “and making a large allowance, sir, for all the gifts of Providence, I should say we were pretty close hauled.”"
"“什么意思？”我问。","“How do you mean?” I asked."
"“先生，我们失去了小艇上第二次装满的那些东西，真是可惜。我就是这个意思。”船长答道。“至于弹药和武器，我们还可维持。但是配给不足，非常不足——利夫西医生，配给不足，也许少了一张嘴反而是件好事。”","“It’s a pity, sir, we lost that second load.That’s what I mean,” replied the captain.“As for powder and shot, we’ll do.But the rations are short, very short—so short, Mr. Livesey, that we’re perhaps as well without that extra mouth.”"
"他指了指国旗下的尸体。","And he pointed to the dead body under the flag."
"就在那时，轰隆一声过后，一颗圆形炮弹呼啸着从木屋顶上飞过，落在远离我们的树林里。","Just then, with a roar and a whistle, a round shot passed high above the roof of the log-house and plumped far beyond us in the wood."
"“哦！”船长说，“接着打吧！你们的弹药已经不多了，小家伙们。”","“Oho!” said the captain.“Blaze away!You’ve little enough powder already, my lads.”"
"第二次发射，目标瞄得准了一些，炮弹落在了栅栏内，扬起一片沙尘，却没造成更大的损失。","At the second trial, the aim was better, and the ball descended inside the stockade, scattering a cloud of sand but doing no further damage."
"“船长，”乡绅说，“在船上根本看不见木屋。他们一定是瞄准了旗子。把它拿进来是不是更好一点？”","“Captain,” said the squire, “the house is quite invisible from the ship.It must be the flag they are aiming at.Would it not be wiser to take it in?”"
"“降下国旗！”船长叫道。“不，先生，我不会的。”他话刚出口，我想我们都赞同他。因为它不仅是一种不屈不挠的海员式的美好感情；它更是一种高明的策略，让我们的敌人看看，我们根本不怕他们的大炮。","“Strike my colours!” cried the captain.“No, sir, not I”; and as soon as he had said the words, I think we all agreed with him.For it was not only a piece of stout, seamanly, good feeling; it was good policy besides and showed our enemies that we despised their cannonade."
"整个晚上，他们都在不停开炮。一颗接一颗的炮弹，不是打远了就是打近了，或只是在栅栏内扬起一片沙尘；他们不得不发射得很高，因此，炮弹落下时已失去了威力，埋入松软的沙地里。我们不必害怕流弹，尽管有一颗穿过木屋的屋顶，又从地下钻了出去。我们很快就习惯了这种吵闹的把戏，只把它看成是板球游戏。","All through the evening they kept thundering away.Ball after ball flew over or fell short or kicked up the sand in the enclosure, but they had to fire so high that the shot fell dead and buried itself in the soft sand.We had no ricochet to fear, and though one popped in through the roof of the log-house and out again through the floor, we soon got used to that sort of horse-play and minded it no more than cricket."
"“这一切有个好处。”船长说，“我们前面林子里的敌人应该都给清理干净了。潮水已经退了有好一会，我们的东西应该都露出来了。谁自愿去把猪肉拿进来。”","“There is one good thing about all this,” observed the captain; “the wood in front of us is likely clear.The ebb has made a good while; our stores should be uncovered.Volunteers to go and bring in pork.”"
"格雷和亨特先去了。他们全副武装，悄悄溜过栅栏，但却白跑一趟。反叛分子们比我们想得要勇敢得多，或者说他们更信任伊斯雷尔的射击水平。他们中有四五个在忙着搬运我们的东西，趟水把它们扛到旁边的一艘小船上。船上的人不时地划两下桨，以使小船在湍流中保持平衡。西尔弗站在艉座板上指挥着；每一个人都从他们的秘密武器库里得到了一支滑膛枪。","Gray and Hunter were the first to come forward.Well armed, they stole out of the stockade, but it proved a useless mission.The mutineers were bolder than we fancied or they put more trust in Israel’s gunnery.For four or five of them were busy carrying off our stores and wading out with them to one of the gigs that lay close by, pulling an oar or so to hold her steady against the current.Silver was in the stern-sheets in command; and every man of them was now provided with a musket from some secret magazine of their own."
"船长坐下写他的日志，这是记录的开头：“亚历山大·斯莫利特，船长；大卫·利夫西，随船医生；亚伯拉罕·格雷，木匠副手；约翰·特里劳尼，船主；约翰·亨特和理查德·乔伊斯，船主仆人，未出过海的新手——以上就是船上剩下的所有忠诚的船员——今天带着配给短缺、仅够十天的储备上岸，在金银岛的木屋上升起英国国旗。托马斯·雷德鲁斯，船主仆人，未出过海的新手，被反叛分子杀死；詹姆斯·霍金斯，船舱侍应生——”这时我也在担心着可怜的吉姆·霍金斯的安危。","The captain sat down to his log, and here is the beginning of the entry: Alexander Smollett, master; David Livesey, ship’sdoctor; Abraham Gray, carpenter’s mate; JohnTrelawney, owner; John Hunter and Richard Joyce,owner’s servants, landsmen—being all that is left faithful of the ship’s company—with stores for tendays at short rations, came ashore this day and flew British colours on the log-house in Treasure Island. Thomas Redruth, owner’s servant, landsman, shot by the mutineers; James Hawkins, cabin-boy—And at the same time, I was wondering over poor Jim Hawkins’ fate."
"从陆地那边传来一声呼叫。","A hail on the land side."
"“有人在对我们呼叫。”正在放哨的亨特说。","“Somebody hailing us,” said Hunter, who was on guard."
"“医生！乡绅！船长！嗨，亨特，是你吗？”一个声音叫道。","“Doctor!Squire!Captain!Hullo, Hunter, is that you?” came the cries."
"我跑向门口，正好看到吉姆·霍金斯。他安然无恙，正从栅栏上翻进来。","And I ran to the door in time to see Jim Hawkins, safe and sound, come climbing over the stockade."
"第十九章 吉姆·霍金斯继续讲述：驻守在栅栏的人","Chapter 19 Narrative Resumed by Jim Hawkins: The Garrison in the Stockade"
"本·冈恩一看见国旗就停住了脚步，一把拉住我的胳膊，坐了下来。","As soon as Ben Gunn saw the colours he came to a halt, stopped me by the arm, and sat down."
"“哎，”他说，“那是你的朋友，错不了。”","“Now,” said he, “there’s your friends, sure enough.”"
"“倒更像是那群叛徒。”我回答道。","“Far more likely it’s the mutineers,” I answered."
"“那里！”他叫道。“哎，在这种地方，除了靠运气吃饭的绅士，没有别人会来。要是西尔弗，他一定会挂起骷髅旗的，你要相信这一点。不，那一定是你的朋友们。那儿还有开炮的声音，我想你的朋友一定干得不错；现在他们在岸上的旧栅栏里，那是很多年前弗林特建造的。啊，他可是个有头脑的人，弗林特！除了朗姆酒，就没见过他有什么对手。他谁也不怕；除了西尔弗——西尔弗很有教养。”","“That!” he cried.“Why, in a place like this, where nobody puts in but gen’lemen of fortune, Silver would fly the Jolly Roger, you don’t make no doubt of that.No, that’s your friends.There’s been blows too, and I reckon your friends has had the best of it; and here they are ashore in the old stockade, as was made years and years ago by Flint.Ah, he was the man to have a headpiece, was Flint!Barring rum, his match were never seen.He were afraid of none, not he; on’y Silver—Silver was that genteel.”"
"“那么，”我说，“也许是这样的，希望如此。我更应该赶紧去加入到我的朋友们中了。”","“Well,” said I, “that may be so, and so be it; all the more reason that I should hurry on and join my friends.”"
"“不，伙计，”本回答道，“你等一等。要是我没看错的话，你是个好孩子；但是不管怎么说，你也只是个孩子。本·冈恩可不是傻瓜。朗姆酒也不能让我到那里去，就是你要去的那个地方——朗姆酒都不行，除非我见到你们那位真正的绅士，并得到他的亲口保证。你别忘了我的话；‘见上一面（你就这么说），见上一面就会更加信任。’——然后这样捏他一下。”","“Nay, mate,” returned Ben, “not you.You’re a good boy, or I’m mistook; but you’re on’y a boy, all told.Now, Ben Gunn is fly.Rum wouldn’t bring me there, where you’re going—not rum wouldn’t, till I see your born gen’leman and gets it on his word of honour.And you won’t forget my words; ‘A precious sight (that’s what you’ll say), a precious sight more confidence’—and then nips him.”"
"接着他带着一样狡黠的神情第三次掐了我一下。","And he pinched me the third time with the same air of cleverness."
"“他们叫本·冈恩过去的时候，你知道到哪里来找他，吉姆。就在你今天发现他的地方。来的人手里要拿个白色的东西，而且要一个人来。哦！你还要说：‘本·冈恩，’你就这么说，‘自有他的道理。’”","“And when Ben Gunn is wanted, you know where to find him, Jim.Just where you found him today.And him that comes is to have a white thing in his hand, and he’s to come alone.Oh!And you’ll say this: ‘Ben Gunn,’ says you, ‘has reasons of his own.’” "
"“好，”我说，“我想我明白了。你有些建议要提，想要见见乡绅或者医生，可以在我发现你的地方找到你。就这么些吗？”","“Well,” said I, “I believe I understand.You have something to propose, and you wish to see the squire or the doctor, and you’re to be found where I found you.Is that all?”"
"“什么时候呢？你要说什么时候。”他补充道，“哎，差不多从正午到钟敲六下的时候吧。”","“And when? said you,” he added.“Why, from about noon observation to about six bells.”"
"“好的。”我说，“现在我能走了吗？”","“Good,” said I, “and now may I go?”"
"“你不会忘了吧？”他焦急地问着。“见上一面，你说，他自有道理。他自有道理；在男人们之间，这是最主要的；那么，好。”他仍拉住我，“我想你可以走了，吉姆。哎，吉姆，如果你见到了西尔弗，你不会出卖本·冈恩吧？就是野马也不能从你嘴里拽出话来吧？你要说绝不会。如果那群海盗在岸上扎了寨，吉姆，我要叫他们的老婆在明天早上变成寡妇，你信不信？”","“You won’t forget?” he inquired anxiously.“Precious sight, and reasons of his own, says you.Reasons of his own; that’s the mainstay; as between man and man.Well, then”—still holding me—“I reckon you can go, Jim.And, Jim, if you was to see Silver, you wouldn’t go for to sell Ben Gunn?Wild horses wouldn’t draw it from you?No, says you.And if them pirates camp ashore, Jim, what would you say but there’d be widders in the morning?”"
"这时，一声巨响打断了他，一颗炮弹穿过树林直飞过来，落在离我们谈话的地方不足一百码远的沙地里。我们俩立刻向着不同的方向拔腿就跑。","Here he was interrupted by a loud report, and a cannonball came tearing through the trees and pitched in the sand not a hundred yards from where we two were talking.The next moment each of us had taken to his heels in a different direction."
"整整一个钟头，接二连三的炮声震动着小岛，炮弹不断地穿过树林轰炸下来。我总是被这些可怕的炮弹追踪着，不停地找地方躲避；至少在我看来是这样的。虽然我仍然不敢往栅栏那边去，因为那里是炮弹袭击最频繁的地方，但是到轰炸快结束的时候，我开始鼓起勇气，向东边绕了一大圈，在岸边的树下爬行着。","For a good hour to come frequent reports shook the island, and balls kept crashing through the woods.I moved from hiding-place to hiding-place, always pursued, or so it seemed to me, by these terrifying missiles.But towards the end of the bombardment, though still I durst not venture in the direction of the stockade, where the balls fell oftenest, I had begun, in a manner, to pluck up my heart again, and after a long detour to the east, crept down among the shoreside trees."
"太阳刚刚落下，海风吹拂过树林，簌簌作响，吹动着停泊处灰色的植被；潮汐也远远退去了，露出了大片沙地；白天的炎热也消散了，现在，空气穿过我的外套，我感到丝丝凉意。","The sun had just set, the sea breeze was rustling and tumbling in the woods and ruffling the grey surface of the anchorage; the tide, too, was far out, and great tracts of sand lay uncovered; the air, after the heat of the day, chilled me through my jacket."
"伊斯帕尼奥拉号仍停泊在抛锚处；然而，船上挂起了骷髅旗——海盗的黑色旗帜——旗帜飘扬在桅杆顶上。正当我观望着，又是红光一闪，一声炮响在岛上回荡，又一颗圆形炮弹呼啸着从空中飞过。这是最后一次开炮。","The HISPANIOLA still lay where she had anchored; but, sure enough, there was the Jolly Roger—the black flag of piracy—flying from her peak.Even as I looked, there came another red flash and another report that sent the echoes clattering, and one more round shot whistled through the air.It was the last of the cannonade."
"我埋伏了一会，观察着袭击过后海盗们的忙乱。在离栅栏不远的岸边，有人在拿斧子砍着什么东西——过后我才发现，是那只可怜的小船。远处，在靠近河口的地方，树林里燃起一堆熊熊的篝火，在那里和大船之间，一只小船不停地来回穿梭。那船上的人，我上午看见时还脸色阴沉，现在却像个孩子似的对着桨手大叫大嚷。但是可以从他们的声音里听出朗姆酒的作用。","I lay for some time watching the bustle which succeeded the attack.Men were demolishing something with axes on the beach near the stockade—the poor jolly boat, I afterwards discovered.Away, near the mouth of the river, a great fire was glowing among the trees, and between that point and the ship one of the gigs kept coming and going, the men, whom I had seen so gloomy, shouting at the oars like children.But there was a sound in their voices which suggested rum."
"最后，我想我大概可以折回到栅栏那边去了。现在，我正处在一个深入海中的低平的沙角上。沙角向东面环抱着抛锚处，在半深的水下与骷髅岛相连；我站起身来，看见在沙角往下更远的地方，低矮的灌木丛中矗立着一块相当高的绝壁，呈古怪的白色。我立刻想到，这可能就是本·冈恩说到的那块白石头，如果哪一天需要小船，我知道去哪里找一条来。","At length I thought I might return towards the stockade.I was pretty far down on the low, sandy spit that encloses the anchorage to the east, and is joined at half water to Skeleton Island; and now, as I rose to my feet, I saw, some distance further down the spit and rising from among low bushes, an isolated rock, pretty high, and peculiarly white in colour.It occurred to me that this might be the white rock of which Ben Gunn had spoken and that some day or other a boat might be wanted and I should know where to look for one."
"然后，我沿着树林的边缘走，直到再次来到栅栏的背后，也就是向着陆地的那边；不久，我就受到了我那群忠诚友人们的热烈欢迎。","Then I skirted among the woods until I had regained the rear, or shoreward side, of the stockade, and was soon warmly welcomed by the faithful party."
"我很快讲述了我的经历，开始打量起四周来。这木屋是由未锯方的松树树干建成的——屋顶，四壁以及地板都是。地板有的地方比沙地高出一英尺或者一个半英尺。门口有个走廊。走廊下面，泉水的细流涌入一个样子古怪的人造蓄水池里——正是一艘大船上的铁锅，敲掉了底，埋在沙子里，正如船长说的“齐平吃水线”。","I had soon told my story and began to look about me.The log-house was made of unsquared trunks of pine-roof, walls, and floor.The latter stood in several places as much as a foot or a foot and a half above the surface of the sand.There was a porch at the door, and under this porch the little spring welled up into an artificial basin of a rather odd kind—no other than a great ship’s kettle of iron, with the bottom knocked out, and sunk “to her bearings,”as the captain said, among the sand."
"木屋除了构架之外，再没有什么其他的东西了，但在一个角落里，有一块摆成炉床样子的石板，一只生锈的旧铁篓子里装着柴火。","Little had been left besides the framework of the house, but in one corner there was a stone slab laid down by way of hearth and an old rusty iron basket to contain the fire."
"小土丘的斜坡上和栅栏内的树木都被砍光了，用来建造木屋了。从留下来的树桩可以看出，以前生长在这里的树林是多么茂盛、高大。在树木移走之后，大部分土壤不是被冲走了，就是堆成了一堆；只有在细流溢出锅边的地方，有一片厚厚的苔藓和一些蕨类植物，以及矮小的蔓生灌木，在沙地里呈现出绿色。只有在距离栅栏极近的地方——他们说，作为防御实在是太近了——仍然有高大茂盛的树木欣欣向荣地生长着，向着陆地这边全是枞树，而向着大海那边却夹杂着长生橡树。","The slopes of the knoll and all the inside of the stockade had been cleared of timber to build the house, and we could see by the stumps what a fine and lofty grove had been destroyed.Most of the soil had been washed away or buried in drift after the removal of the trees; only where the streamlet ran down from the kettle a thick bed of moss and some ferns and little creeping bushes were still green among the sand.Very close around the stockade—too close for defence, they said—the wood still flourished high and dense, all of fir on the land side, but towards the sea with a large admixture of live oaks."
"我曾提到过的微凉的晚风，呼啸着吹过这粗糙木屋的每一个缝隙，不断地在地板上洒下细沙。我们眼睛里都是沙子，嘴巴里也是沙子，晚饭里也有沙子，沙粒在锅底的清泉里舞着，简直就像是快要烧开的麦片粥一样。我们的烟囱就是房顶上一个四方形的洞，只有一小部分的烟能够出去，余下的在屋子里打着转，呛得我们又是咳嗽，又是流泪。","The cold evening breeze, of which I have spoken, whistled through every chink of the rude building and sprinkled the floor with a continual rain of fine sand.There was sand in our eyes, sand in our teeth, sand in our suppers, sand dancing in the spring at the bottom of the kettle, for all the world like porridge beginning to boil.Our chimney was a square hole in the roof; it was but a little part of the smoke that found its way out, and the rest eddied about the house and kept us coughing and piping the eye."
"除了这些，那个新来的格雷因为在脱离反叛分子时脸被划了一刀，因此绑了条绷带，而可怜的汤姆·雷德鲁斯还没下葬，仍在墙边放着，盖着国旗的身体十分僵硬。","Add to this that Gray, the new man, had his face tied up in a bandage for a cut he had got in breaking away from the mutineers and that poor old Tom Redruth, still unburied, lay along the wall, stiff and stark, under the Union Jack."
"要是我们无所事事地坐着，大家就都会陷入一种忧郁的状态，但是斯莫利特船长绝不允许那样的状况出现。他把我们都叫到跟前，分成了两个组放哨。医生、格雷和我一组；乡绅、亨特和乔伊斯一组。尽管我们都很累，还是派了两个人去砍柴；另外两个人去给雷德鲁斯挖一个坟墓；医生当上了厨子；我在门口放哨；而船长自己则在大家身边穿梭着，给大家鼓劲儿，在需要帮忙的地方搭把手。","If we had been allowed to sit idle, we should all have fallen in the blues, but Captain Smollett was never the man for that.All hands were called up before him, and he divided us into watches.The doctor and Gray and I for one; the squire, Hunter, and Joyce upon the other.Tired though we all were, two were sent out for firewood; two more were set to dig a grave for Redruth; the doctor was named cook; I was put sentry at the door; and the captain himself went from one to another, keeping up our spirits and lending a hand wherever it was wanted."
"医生时不时地到门口来呼吸点新鲜空气，同时休息休息眼睛，那双眼睛给熏得几乎要掉出来了。每次他到门口来，总要跟我说句话。","From time to time the doctor came to the door for a little air and to rest his eyes, which were almost smoked out of his head, and whenever he did so, he had a word for me."
"“斯莫利特这个人，”他有一次说，“比我厉害。我这么说是有根据的，吉姆。”","“That man Smollett,” he said once, “is a better man than I am.And when I say that it means a deal, Jim.”"
"又有一次，他出来，沉默了一会。然后把头侧过来看着我。","Another time he came and was silent for a while.Then he put his head on one side, and looked at me."
"“这个本·冈恩是条好汉吗？”他问。","“Is this Ben Gunn a man?” he asked."
"“我不知道，先生。”我说，“我不确定他是不是疯了。”","“I do not know, sir,” said I.“I am not very sure whether he’s sane.”"
"“如果你对此还存有一点怀疑的话，那他就还没疯。”医生答道，“一个三年来只能在荒岛上啃指甲的人，吉姆，你不能指望他还像你我这样神志清醒。人性不是这样的。你是说，他很想吃奶酪？”","“If there’s any doubt about the matter, he is,” returned the doctor.“A man who has been three years biting his nails on a desert island, Jim, can’t expect to appear as sane as you or me.It doesn’t lie in human nature.Was it cheese you said he had a fancy for?”"
"“是的，先生，是奶酪。”我回答道。","“Yes, sir, cheese,” I answered."
"“那么，吉姆，”他说，“看看精美的饭菜给你带来的好处吧。你曾见过我的鼻烟壶，是不是？但是你从来没见过我从里面拿鼻烟出来吧，原因就是我在鼻烟壶里放了一块帕马森奶酪——一块意大利产的奶酪，营养丰富。现在，就给本·冈恩啦！”","“Well, Jim,” said he, “just see the good that comes of being dainty in your food.You’ve seen my snuff-box, haven’t you?And you never saw me take snuff, the reason being that in my snuff-box I carry a piece of Parmesan cheese—a cheese made in Italy, very nutritious.Well, that’s for Ben Gunn!”"
"吃晚饭前，我们在沙地里埋了老汤姆，在微风中，我们脱帽，围着坟墓站了片刻。他们砍回了一大捆柴火，但还不如船长预期得多。他看着柴火摇了摇头，告诉我们“明天必须再加把劲儿，多砍一些回来”。然后，我们吃了些猪肉，每个人还喝了杯掺水的白兰地酒；之后，三位领头人聚到角落里讨论起我们的前景来了。","Before supper was eaten we buried old Tom in the sand and stood round him for a while bare-headed in the breeze.A good deal of firewood had been got in, but not enough for the captain’s fancy, and he shook his head over it and told us we “must get back to this tomorrow rather livelier.”Then, when we had eaten our pork and each had a good stiff glass of brandy grog, the three chiefs got together in a corner to discuss our prospects."
"看起来，对于接下来该怎么做，他们也完全没了主意。食品储备太少了，我们肯定等不及救援到来，就会因为饥饿而投降了。但是，我们最大的希望，就是消灭叛徒，直到他们降下骷髅旗，或者驾驶着伊斯帕尼奥拉号逃跑。他们的人数已经从十九个减少到十五个了，还有两个负了伤，而且至少有一个人——在大炮旁边被打中的那个——即使没死，也已经伤得够呛了。每次向他们开火，我们都必须极其谨慎，以保全自己的生命。除此之外，我们还有两个得力助手——朗姆酒和岛上的气候。","It appears they were at their wits’ end what to do, the stores being so low that we must have been starved into surrender long before help came.But our best hope, it was decided, was to kill off the buccaneers until they either hauled down their flag or ran away with the HISPANIOLA.From nineteen they were already reduced to fifteen, two others were wounded, and one at least—the man shot beside the gun severely wounded, if he were not dead.Every time we had a crack at them, we were to take it, saving our own lives, with the extremest care.And besides that, we had two able allies rum and the climate."
"至于前者，即使在半英里开外，我们也能够听见他们在深夜里大声吵嚷唱歌的声音；而后者，医生以他的假发打赌，他们在沼泽里扎营，又缺乏医药，一周之内就会有一半的人病倒。","As for the first, though we were about half a mile away, we could hear them roaring and singing late into the night; and as for the second, the doctor staked his wig that, camped where they were in the marsh and unprovided with remedies, the half of them would be on their backs before a week."
"“因此，”他补充道，“只要我们没先被干掉，他们会巴不得驾着船逃跑的。那终归是条船，我想，他们可以再做回海盗。”","“So,” he added, “if we are not all shot down first they’ll be glad to be packing in the schooner.It’s always a ship, and they can get to buccaneering again, I suppose.”"
"“这是我失去的第一条船。”斯莫利特船长说。","“First ship that ever I lost,” said Captain Smollett."
"你或许能想象到，我简直累得要死；翻来覆去一番之后，我终于睡着了，睡得就像木头一样死。","I was dead tired, as you may fancy; and when I got to sleep, which was not till after a great deal of tossing, I slept like a log of wood."
"当我被一阵喧哗吵醒时，其他人已经起来很久了，都吃过了早饭，还砍了比昨天总量多一半的柴禾回来。","The rest had long been up and had already breakfasted and increased the pile of firewood by about half as much again when I was wakened by a bustle and the sound of voices."
"“休战的白旗！”","“Flag of truce!”"
"我听见有人说；紧接着传来一声惊叫：“西尔弗本人！”","I heard someone say; and then, immediately after, with a cry of surprise, “Silver himself!”"
"听到这句话，我一下跳了起来，揉揉眼睛，跑到墙壁上的一个弹孔前。","And at that, up I jumped, and rubbing my eyes, ran to a loophole in the wall."
"第二十章 西尔弗的谈判","Chapter 20 Silver’s Embassy "
"的确，栅栏外有两个人，其中一人挥舞着一块白布，另外一个安静地站在一边，正是西尔弗本人。","Sure enough, there were two men just outside the stockade, one of them waving a white cloth, the other, no less a person than Silver himself, standing placidly by."
"时候还很早，我觉得这是自出海以来最冷的一个早晨——寒气深入骨髓。天空晴朗无云，晨光给林梢抹上一道玫瑰色的光彩。但是西尔弗和他的副手所站的地方却全在阴影中；夜间，一层白色的雾气在沼泽上低低地弥漫开来，他们就站在这齐膝深的雾气里。这寒意和雾气结合在一起，表明了小岛恶劣的环境。这里显然是个潮湿、闷热、对健康无益的地方。","It was still quite early, and the coldest morning that I think I ever was abroad in—a chill that pierced into the marrow.The sky was bright and cloudless overhead, and the tops of the trees shone rosily in the sun.But where Silver stood with his lieutenant, all was still in shadow, and they waded knee-deep in a low white vapour that had crawled during the night out of the morass.The chill and the vapour taken together told a poor tale of the island.It was plainly a damp, feverish, unhealthy spot."
"“都呆在屋里，伙计们。”船长说，“我敢打赌这是个骗局。”","“Keep indoors, men,” said the captain.“Ten to one this is a trick.”"
"然后他向海盗喊起话来。","Then he hailed the buccaneer."
"“谁在那儿？站住，不然我们就开枪了。”","“Who goes?Stand, or we fire.”"
"“休战白旗！”西尔弗喊道。","“Flag of truce,” cried Silver."
"船长站在走廊上，保持着高度警惕，以免遭到冷枪袭击。他转过身对我们说：“医生那组注意警戒。利夫西医生，麻烦你守在北边；吉姆，东边；格雷，西边。不看守的一组，所有人给滑膛枪上子弹。打起精神来，伙计们，小心。”","The captain was in the porch, keeping himself carefully out of the way of a treacherous shot, should any be intended.He turned and spoke to us, “Doctor’s watch on the lookout.Mr.  Livesey take the north side, if you please; Jim, the east; Gray, west.The watch below, all hands to load muskets.Lively, men, and careful.”"
"接着，他又转向了叛徒们。","And then he turned again to the mutineers."
"“你们拿着休战旗想要干什么？”他叫道。","“And what do you want with your flag of truce?” he cried."
"这次，是另外一个人答了话。","This time it was the other man who replied."
"“先生，西尔弗船长要上岸来谈判。”他喊着。","“Cap’n Silver, sir, to come on board and make terms,” he shouted."
"“西尔弗船长！我不认识他。他是谁？”船长叫道。我们听见他又自言自语地说道：“船长，真的吗？好哇，高升了！”","“Cap’n Silver!Don’t know him.Who’s he?” cried the captain.And we could hear him adding to himself, “Cap’n, is it?My heart, and here’s promotion!”"
"高个子约翰自己回答道：“是我，先生。在你弃船离开之后，这些可怜的小伙子们选了我当船长，先生。”——他特别强调了“弃船离开”这个词。“如果能谈判成功，我们愿意服从管理，而且实话实说。我所希望的，就是你一句话，斯莫利特船长，待会儿让我平平安安地走出栅栏，等我走出射程之后再开枪。”","Long John answered for himself.“Me, sir.These poor lads have chosen me cap’n, after your desertion, sir”—laying a particular emphasis upon the word “desertion.”“We’re willing to submit, if we can come to terms, and no bones about it.All I ask is your word, Cap’n Smollett, to let me safe and sound out of this here stockade, and one minute to get out o’ shot before a gun is fired.”"
"“伙计，”斯莫利特船长说，“我一点儿也不想跟你谈话。要是你愿意跟我谈话，你可以上来找我，就这样。如果有什么阴谋的话，一定是你们那边的，上帝保佑你。”","“My man,” said Captain Smollett, “I have not the slightest desire to talk to you.If you wish to talk to me, you can come, that’s all.If there’s any treachery, it’ll be on your side, and the Lord help you.”"
"“这就够了，船长。”高个子约翰高兴地叫着，“有你这一句话就够了。我了解绅士，你可以那样的。”","“That’s enough, cap’n,” shouted Long John cheerily.“A word from you’s enough.I know a gentleman, and you may lay to that.”"
"我们能看见拿着休战旗的那位试图把西尔弗拉回来。因为他见到船长的回答是那么满不在乎，这倒也没什么可奇怪的。但是西尔弗大声嘲笑他，还拍拍他的背，好像这警惕的念头是杞人忧天。然后西尔弗来到栅栏旁，先把拐杖扔进来，抬起一条腿，费了很大的力气终于成功翻越过栅栏，安全地落在另一边。","We could see the man who carried the flag of truce attempting to hold Silver back.Nor was that wonderful, seeing how cavalier had been the captain’s answer.But Silver laughed at him aloud and slapped him on the back as if the idea of alarm had been absurd.Then he advanced to the stockade, threw over his crutch, got a leg up, and with great vigour and skill succeeded in surmounting the fence and dropping safely to the other side."
"我得承认，眼前的一切着实吸引了我，使我一点也没起到哨兵的作用。确实，我已经离开了东边的弹孔，悄悄来到船长身后；船长正坐在门槛上，手肘支在膝盖上，用手托着头，眼睛盯着沙地上旧铁锅里冒着气泡的泉水。他吹着口哨“来吧，姑娘们，小伙子们。”","I will confess that I was far too much taken up with what was going on to be of the slightest use as sentry; indeed, I had already deserted my eastern loophole and crept up behind the captain, who had now seated himself on the threshold, with his elbows on his knees, his head in his hands, and his eyes fixed on the water as it bubbled out of the old iron kettle in the sand.He was whistling “Come, Lasses and Lads.”"
"西尔弗费了好大的劲儿才爬上土丘。山坡很陡，上面密密地布满树桩，沙地松软。在这种地方，他和他的拐杖就像搁浅的船一样毫无办法。但是他像条汉子一样默默坚持下来，终于来到了船长面前，非常优雅地向船长行了个礼。他精心打扮了一番；身上穿着一件宽大的蓝色外套，下摆一直垂到膝盖处，衣服上钉着许多铜纽扣，后脑门上还带着顶镶了花边的漂亮帽子。","Silver had terrible hard work getting up the knoll.What with the steepness of the incline, the thick tree stumps, and the soft sand, he and his crutch were as helpless as a ship in stays.But he stuck to it like a man in silence, and at last arrived before the captain, whom he saluted in the handsomest style.He was tricked out in his best; an immense blue coat, thick with brass buttons, hung as low as to his knees, and a fine laced hat was set on the back of his head."
"“你来啦，伙计。”船长说，抬起头来，“你最好坐下。”","“Here you are, my man,” said the captain, raising his head.“You had better sit down.”"
"“你不让我进去吗，船长？”高个子约翰抱怨道。“这么冷的早上，先生，坐在外面沙地上确实太冷了。”","“You ain’t a going to let me inside, cap’n?” complained Long John.“It’s a main cold morning, to be sure, sir, to sit outside upon the sand.”"
"“哎，西尔弗，”船长说，“如果你当初愿意做一个老实人，你现在可能还坐在你的厨房里呢。这是你自找的。你要么当我船上的厨子——那样会待遇从优——要么你就当西尔弗船长，一个普通的叛徒、海盗，那么你就等着上绞架吧！”","“Why, Silver,” said the captain, “if you had pleased to be an honest man, you might have been sitting in your galley.It’s your own doing.You’re either my ship’s cook—and then you were treated handsome—or Cap’n Silver, a common mutineer and pirate, and then you can go hang!”"
"“好吧，好吧，船长。”厨子回答说，一边按吩咐在沙地上坐了下来，“你一会儿还要再帮把手，拉我起来，就这样。你这地方真是不错啊。啊，吉姆在那儿！早上好啊，吉姆。医生，向您问好。哎，可以说，你们聚在一起真像是个幸福的大家庭啊。”","“Well, well, cap’n,” returned the sea cook, sitting down as he was bidden on the sand, “you’ll have to give me a hand up again, that’s all.A sweet pretty place you have of it here.Ah, there’s Jim!The top of the morning to you, Jim.Doctor, here’s my service.Why, there you all are together like a happy family, in a manner of speaking.”"
"“你要是有什么话，伙计，就赶紧说。”船长说道。","“If you have anything to say, my man, better say it,” said the captain."
"“你说对了，斯莫利特船长。”西尔弗回答道，“公事公办，没错。那么，你瞧，你们昨晚上干得好哇。我不否认干得很出色。你们中有几位棍棒使得很厉害。我也不否认，我的人给打了个措手不及——可能所有人都给打了个措手不及；也许我自己都给打了个措手不及；可能这就是我来谈判的原因。但是你听好了，船长，这种事不会再发生第二次，真的！我们会站岗放哨——少喝点朗姆酒。也许你觉得我们那时都喝醉了。但是我告诉你，我当时很清醒；我只是疲惫不堪了；如果我早醒来一秒钟的话，就会抓你个现行，我会的。我跑到他跟前的时候，他还没死呢，还没有。”","“Right you were, Cap’n Smollett,” replied Silver.“Dooty is dooty, to be sure.Well now, you look here, that was a good lay of yours last night.I don’t deny it was a good lay.Some of you pretty handy with a handspike end.And I’ll not deny neither but what some of my people was shook—maybe all was shook; maybe I was shook myself; maybe that’s why I’m here for terms.But you mark me, cap’n, it won’t do twice, by thunder!We’ll have to do sentry—go and ease off a point or so on the rum.Maybe you think we were all a sheet in the wind’s eye.But I’ll tell you I was sober; I was on’y dog tired; and if I’d awoke a second sooner, I’d ‘a caught you at the act, I would.He wasn’t dead when I got round to him, not he.”"
"“是吗？”斯莫利特船长尽量保持冷静地说。","“Well?” said Captain Smollett as cool as can be."
"西尔弗说的这一切对他来说就像个谜语，但你从他的语调里却绝对猜不出来。而我，我开始理出点头绪了。我想起了本·冈恩最后的几句话。我认为，在海盗们烂醉如泥地躺在篝火边的时候，本·冈恩袭击了他们。我高兴地计算出，现在我们要对付的敌人只有十四个了。","All that Silver said was a riddle to him, but you would never have guessed it from his tone.As for me, I began to have an inkling.Ben Gunn’s last words came back to my mind.I began to suppose that he had paid the buccaneers a visit while they all lay drunk together round their fire, and I reckoned up with glee that we had only fourteen enemies to deal with."
"“好了，就这样。”西尔弗说，“我们想要宝藏，我们也一定能拿到——这就是我们的目的！你也可以及早保命，我想，那是你们的目的。你有张地图，是不是？”","“Well, here it is,” said Silver.“We want that treasure, and we’ll have it—that’s our point!You would just as soon save your lives, I reckon; and that’s yours.You have a chart, haven’t you?”"
"“也许是吧。”船长答道。","“That’s as may be,” replied the captain."
"“哦，那就是说你有咯，我知道你有。”高个子约翰说，“对人说话没必要这么粗声粗气的；那么做一点好处都没有，你可以相信我。我的意思是，我们想要你的地图。哎，就我来说，我是不会伤害你的。”“这招对我没用，伙计。”船长打断了他，“我们知道你们想要干什么，我们不在乎；现在，你瞧，你做不到。”","“Oh, well, you have, I know that,” returned Long John.“You needn’t be so husky with a man; there ain’t a particle of service in that, and you may lay to it.What I mean is, we want your chart.Now, I never meant you no harm, myself.”“That won’t do with me, my man,” interrupted the captain.“We know exactly what you meant to do, and we don’t care, for now, you see, you can’t do it.”"
"船长冷静地看着他，继续往烟筒里装着烟草。","And the captain looked at him calmly and proceeded to fill a pipe."
"“如果亚伯拉罕·格雷——”西尔弗突然大喊。","“If Abe Gray—” Silver broke out."
"“住口！”斯莫利特船长船长吼道，“格雷什么都没说，我也没问；另外，我巴不得看见你跟他，以及整个小岛一起沉到水里去。这就是我想跟你说的，伙计。”","“Avast there!” cried Mr. Smollett.“Gray told me nothing, and I asked him nothing; and what’s more, I would see you and him and this whole island blown clean out of the water into blazes first.So there’s my mind for you, my man, on that.”"
"船长的这通发作似乎让西尔弗冷静了一些。他之前似乎有些怒气，这会儿又恢复了平静。","This little whiff of temper seemed to cool Silver down.He had been growing nettled before, but now he pulled himself together."
"“也许吧。”他说，“各位绅士认为应当怎样就怎样做吧，我不会干涉。船长，看到你要抽烟斗，我也就不客气了，也要抽一斗。”","“Like enough,” said he.“I would set no limits to what gentlemen might consider shipshape, or might not, as the case were.And seein’ as how you are about to take a pipe, cap’n, I’ll make so free as do likewise.”"
"接着他装了一斗烟，点着火。这两个人就坐着默默地抽了会儿烟，时不时互相看一眼，时不时地按一按烟草，时不时还俯身吐口唾沫。看着他俩就像在演戏一样。","And he filled a pipe and lighted it; and the two men sat silently smoking for quite a while, now looking each other in the face, now stopping their tobacco, now leaning forward to spit.It was as good as the play to see them."
"“那么，”西尔弗接着说，“是这么回事。你把地图给我们，让我们找到宝藏，并且你们停止攻击可怜的船员，不要在他们熟睡时敲碎他们的脑袋。你照办了，我们就给你个选择。等宝藏运上了船，要么你上船同我们呆在一起，那么我可以以我的名誉给你担保，让你在安全的地方上岸。要么，如果你不想这样，因为我手下有几个人很粗野，还为你以前为难过他们而记着旧仇，你可以留在这里，你可以。我们会跟你均分食品储备，按人头分；而且，我像刚才那样保证，一定会让我看见的第一艘船来这里接你们。现在，你得承认这两个方案都不错吧。再找不着更好的了。我希望——”西尔弗提高了声音说，“这木屋里的所有人都明白我的意思，因为对这个人说的话也是对你们每一个人说的。”","“Now,” resumed Silver, “here it is.You give us the chart to get the treasure by, and drop shooting poor seamen and stoving of their heads in while asleep.You do that, and we’ll offer you a choice.Either you come aboard along of us, once the treasure shipped, and then I’ll give you my affy davy, upon my word of honour, to clap you somewhere safe ashore.Or if that ain’t to your fancy, some of my hands being rough and having old scores on account of hazing, then you can stay here, you can.We’ll divide stores with you, man for man; and I’ll give my affy davy, as before to speak the first ship I sight, and send ‘em here to pick you up.Now, you’ll own that’s talking.Handsomer you couldn’t look to get, now you.And I hope” —raising his voice—“that all hands in this here block house will overhaul my words, for what is spoke to one is spoke to all.”"
"斯莫利特船长站起身来，在他的左手手心里敲了敲烟灰。","Captain Smollett rose from his seat and knocked out the ashes of his pipe in the palm of his left hand."
"“就这些吗？”他问。","“Is that all?” he asked"
"“都说完了，一句不剩！”约翰回答道，“你要是拒绝的话，就再也见不到我了，等着吃子弹吧。”","“Every last word, by thunder!” answered John.“Refuse that, and you’ve seen the last of me but musket-balls.”"
"“很好。”船长说，“现在听我说。如果你们一个个不带着武器来找我，我可以给你们拷上镣铐，带回英国，接受公正的裁决。若是你们不来，我，亚历山大·斯莫利特，就要升起国旗，然后让你们全去见海妖。你们是找不到宝藏的。你们也开不了船，你们中没有一个人会开船。你们也打不赢我们；格雷就从你们五个人中间跑出来了。你的船现在进退不得，西尔弗船长；你们处在下风岸，你会发现这一点的。我站在这里告诉你这些，这是我给你的最后忠告，因为，以上帝的名义，下次我再见到你，一定会朝你后背开上一枪。走开吧，小伙子。请赶紧离开，手脚并用地爬回去吧，赶紧。”","“Very good,” said the captain.“Now you’ll hear me.If you’ll come up one by one, unarmed, I’ll engage to clap you all in irons and take you home to a fair trial in England.If you won’t, my name is Alexander Smollett, I’ve flown my sovereign’s colours, and I’ll see you all to Davy Jones.You can’t find the treasure.You can’t sail the ship—there’s not a man among you fit to sail the ship.You can’t fight us—Gray, there, got away from five of you.Your ship’s in irons, Master Silver; you’re on a lee shore, and so you’ll find.I stand here and tell you so; and they’re the last good words you’ll get from me, for in the name of heaven, I’ll put a bullet in your back when next I meet you.Tramp, my lad.Bundle out of this, please, hand over hand, and double quick.”"
"西尔弗的脸真够瞧的，他的双眼因为暴怒而突出来。他抖掉了烟筒里的烟灰。","Silver’s face was a picture; his eyes started in his head with wrath.He shook the fire out of his pipe."
"“拉我起来！”他喊道。","“Give me a hand up!” he cried."
"“我才不会。”船长回答。","“Not I,” returned the captain."
"“谁来拉我起来？”他大吼着。","“Who’ll give me a hand up?” he roared."
"我们之中没有一个人移动半步。他嘟嘟囔囔、骂着最下流的脏话，一边在沙地上爬着，直到抓住门廊柱子，借助拐杖重新站起身来。接着他向泉水里吐了口唾沫。","Not a man among us moved.Growling the foulest imprecations, he crawled along the sand till he got hold of the porch and could hoist himself again upon his crutch.Then he spat into the spring."
"“这个！”他大叫道，“这就是我对你的看法。不出一个小时，我就要把你们这老木屋像个朗姆酒桶似的砸烂。笑吧，挨雷劈的，笑吧！不出一个小时，你们就到另一个世界去笑吧。我要让你们生不如死。”","“There!” he cried.“That’s what I think of ye.Before an hour’s out, I’ll stove in your old block house like a rum puncheon.Laugh, by thunder, laugh!Before an hour’s out, ye’ll laugh upon the other side.Them that die’ll be the lucky ones.”"
"他又骂了一会，才踉踉跄跄地踩着沙走开，试了四五次，才在拿着休战旗的人的帮助下越过栅栏，接着立刻消失在了树林中。","And with a dreadful oath he stumbled off, ploughed down the sand, was helped across the stockade, after four or five failures, by the man with the flag of truce, and disappeared in an instant afterwards among the trees."
"第二十一章 进攻","Chapter 21 The Attack "
"船长一直密切监视着西尔弗，当西尔弗一消失，他立刻转身回到屋里，发现除了格雷我们大家都不在自己的岗位上。头一次，我们见到船长发火。","As soon as Silver disappeared, the captain, who had been closely watching him, turned towards the interior of the house and found not a man of us at his post but Gray.It was the first time we had ever seen him angry."
"他大声喊道：“各就各位！”接着，当我们全都偷偷溜回自己的岗位后，他说：“格雷，我要把你的名字记在航海日志，你像一名真正的海员，忠于职守。特里劳尼先生，您真让我惊讶。医生，我想你应该服过兵役！先生，如果你在丰特努瓦也这样表现的话，那你最好呆在你的卧铺上。”","“Quarters!” he roared.And then, as we all slunk back to our places, “Gray,” he said, “I’ll put your name in the log; you’ve stood by your duty like a seaman.Mr. Trelawney, I’m surprised at you, sir.Doctor, I thought you had worn the king’s coat!If that was how you served at Fontenoy, sir, you’d have been better in your berth.”"
"医生的人都回到自己的射击孔旁，其他人则忙着给备用的滑膛枪装子弹。你可能知道，我们每个人都脸色通红，正如俗语所说，我们被骂得“狗血喷头”。","The doctor’s watch were all back at their loopholes, the rest were busy loading the spare muskets, and everyone with a red face, you may be certain, and a flea in his ear, as the saying is."
"船长静静地查看了一会儿。然后，他开始讲话。","The captain looked on for a while in silence.Then he spoke."
"他说：“伙计们，我狠狠地骂了一顿西尔弗。我是故意狠狠地刺激他。正如他所说的，一小时之内，敌人就会登船进攻。不用我说，大家也知道敌人人数比我们多，但是我们作战时有掩护，而且一分钟前我还说过我们必须有组织地作战。我坚信，如果你们有决心，我们能彻底打败他们。”","“My lads,” said he, “I’ve given Silver a broadside.I pitched it in red hot on purpose; and before the hour’s out, as he said, we shall be boarded.We’re outnumbered, I needn’t tell you that, but we fight in shelter; and a minute ago I should have said we fought with discipline.I’ve no manner of doubt that we can drub them, if you choose.”"
"接着，他又检查了一遍，正如他所说，一切都准备好了。","Then he went the rounds and saw, as he said, that all was clear."
"屋子东西两边窄，所以只有两个射击孔；南面有门廊，也只有两个射击孔；北面有五个。我们七个人有二十支滑膛枪。柴火堆成了四堆——你也可以说堆成了四个台子——每个台子都在屋子一边的正中间，台子上面放着弹药和四支上了弹药的步枪，供防守的使用。屋子正中放了一排弯刀。","On the two short sides of the house, east and west, there were only two loopholes; on the south side where the porch was, two again; and on the north side, five.There was a round score of muskets for the seven of us; the firewood had been built into four piles-tables, you might say—one about the middle of each side, and on each of these tables some ammunition and four loaded muskets were laid ready to the hand of the defenders.In the middle, the cutlasses lay ranged."
"船长说：“把火熄了。寒气过去了，我们就不要让烟熏着眼睛了。”","“Toss out the fire,” said the captain, “the chill is past, and we mustn’t have smoke in our eyes.”"
"特里劳尼先生把整个铁火篮拎了出去，把余火闷熄在了沙子里。","The iron fire-basket was carried bodily out by Mr. Trelawney, and the embers smothered among sand."
"“霍金斯还没有吃早饭。霍金斯，自己去拿早饭，然后回岗位上吃。”斯莫利特船长接着说，“伙计们，精神点！人要是活着就得吃饭。亨特，给周围所有人都倒上白兰地。”","“Hawkins hasn’t had his breakfast.Hawkins, help yourself, and back to your post to eat it,” continued Captain Smollett.“Lively, now, my lad; you’ll want it before you’ve done.Hunter, serve out a round of brandy to all hands.”"
"在这段时间里，船长在心里已经盘算好了防守计划。","And while this was going on, the captain completed, in his own mind, the plan of the defence."
"“医生，你负责守门。”他停了一会儿接着说，“注意，不要暴露自己；在里面守着，从门廊往外开火。亨特，你负责守东边那儿。乔伊斯，伙计，你守西面。特里劳尼先生，你是最棒的射击手——你和格雷守北边。那边长，有五个射击孔，所以很危险。要是他们能攻到这儿，从左舷朝我们开火，事情可就糟了。霍金斯，你我的枪法都不行，我们就在旁边帮着装弹药，帮帮忙。”","“Doctor, you will take the door,” he resumed.“See, and don’t expose yourself; keep within, and fire through the porch.Hunter, take the east side, there.Joyce, you stand by the west, my man.Mr. Trelawney, you are the best shot—you and Gray will take this long north side, with the five loopholes; it’s there the danger is.If they can get up to it and fire in upon us through our own ports, things would begin to look dirty.Hawkins, neither you nor I are much account at the shooting; we’ll stand by to load and bear a hand.”"
"正如船长说的，寒气过去了。太阳刚爬到我们四周的树上，就炽热地照向空地，将雾气吸干了。过了一会儿，沙子就变得很热，木屋圆木里的树脂也逐渐融化。我们把外套和大衣扔在一旁，衬衣敞开领口，翻到肩上。每个人都站在自己的岗位上，激动而紧张。","As the captain had said, the chill was past.As soon as the sun had climbed above our girdle of trees, it fell with all its force upon the clearing and drank up the vapours at a draught.Soon the sand was baking and the resin melting in the logs of the block house.Jackets and coats were flung aside, shirts thrown open at the neck and rolled up to the shoulders; and we stood there, each at his post, in a fever of heat and anxiety."
"一个小时过去了。","An hour passed away."
"船长说道：“该死的！这天气闷得像是赤道无风带似的。格雷，吹个口哨招招风。”","“Hang them!” said the captain.“This is as dull as the doldrums.Gray, whistle for a wind.”"
"这时传来了袭击的第一个音讯。","And just at that moment came the first news of the attack."
"乔伊斯说：“请问，先生，只要我看见外人就可以开枪吗？”","“If you please, sir,” said Joyce, “if I see anyone, am I to fire?”"
"“我说过了，可以！”船长大喊道。","“I told you so!” cried the captain."
"“谢谢，先生。”乔伊斯仍然礼貌地低声答道。","“Thank you, sir,” returned Joyce with the same quiet civility."
"接下来一阵什么事儿也没有，但那句话使我们都竖起耳朵、睁大眼睛警惕着。枪手们平端着枪；船长站在木屋中央，紧闭着嘴唇、皱着眉头。","Nothing followed for a time, but the remark had set us all on the alert, straining ears and eyes—the musketeers with their pieces balanced in their hands, the captain out in the middle of the block house with his mouth very tight and a frown on his face."
"这样又过了几秒钟，突然，乔伊斯突然举起枪开火了。枪声还没停止就听见围墙四周传来连续的扫射声，像一群大雁似的，连续不断。有几枪打中了木屋，但是都没射透。当硝烟散去，四周的防护栏和林子又恢复了先前的安静和空寂。没有一根树枝晃动，也没有一杆暴露敌人的枪在闪光。","So some seconds passed, till suddenly Joyce whipped up his musket and fired.The report had scarcely died away ere it was repeated and repeated from without in a scattering volley, shot behind shot, like a string of geese, from every side of the enclosure.Several bullets struck the log-house, but not one entered; and as the smoke cleared away and vanished, the stockade and the woods around it looked as quiet and empty as before.Not a bough waved, not the gleam of a musket-barrel betrayed the presence of our foes."
"“你打中那个人了吗？”船长问道。","“Did you hit your man?” asked the captain."
"乔伊斯回答说：“没有，先生。我认为没打中。”","“No, sir,” replied Joyce.“I believe not, sir.”"
"“说实话也好。”斯莫利特船长小声说道。“霍金斯，把他的枪装上子弹。医生，你那边开了几枪？”","“Next best thing to tell the truth,” muttered Captain Smollett.“Load his gun, Hawkins.How many should say there were on your side, doctor?”"
"利夫西医生说：“我很清楚。这边开了三枪。我看到三次闪光——两次比较近——还有一次远点儿，打到西边去了。”","“I know precisely,” said Mr. Livesey.“Three shots were fired on this side.I saw the three flashes—two close together—one farther to the west.”"
"船长重复道：“三枪！","“Three!” repeated the captain."
"特里劳尼先生，你那边几枪？”","“And how many on yours, Mr. Trelawney?”"
"但这个可很难回答。从北边打来了很多枪——乡绅算的是七枪，但格雷说有八九枪。从东、西两个方向一共就射过来一枪。因此，很明显进攻是从北面开展的，而其它三面只是敌人的佯攻，骚扰一下我们而已。但是斯莫利特船长没有改变他的安排。他提出，如果反叛者成功越过防护栏，他们就会占领无人把守的射击孔，将我们像老鼠一样打死在我们自己的堡垒里。","But this was not so easily answered.There had come many from the north—seven by the squire’s computation, eight or nine according to Gray.From the east and west only a single shot had been fired.It was plain, therefore, that the attack would be developed from the north and that on the other three sides we were only to be annoyed by a show of hostilities.But Captain Smollett made no change in his arrangements.If the mutineers succeeded in crossing the stockade, he argued, they would take possession of any unprotected loophole and shoot us down like rats in our own stronghold."
"现在我们也没时间多想了。突然，随着一阵大叫，一小伙海盗跃过了北面的林子，直接朝防护栏跑来。与此同时，林子里又传来了枪声，一颗子弹呼啸着飞进门口，把医生的滑膛枪打得粉碎。","Nor had we much time left to us for thought.Suddenly, with a loud huzza, a little cloud of pirates leaped from the woods on the north side and ran straight on the stockade.At the same moment, the fire was once more opened from the woods, and a rifle ball sang through the doorway and knocked the doctor’s musket into bits."
"海盗们像猴子一样从栅栏蜂拥而过。乡绅和格雷又开始一枪连一枪地射击。三个人倒下了，一个朝前倒进栅栏里面，剩下两个朝后倒在外面。但这几个人之中，有一个显然是受了惊吓，而不是受了伤，因为他转眼间就爬了起来，立刻消失在了树林里。","The boarders swarmed over the fence like monkeys.Squire and Gray fired again and yet again; three men fell, one forwards into the enclosure, two back on the outside.But of these, one was evidently more frightened than hurt, for he was on his feet again in a crack and instantly disappeared among the trees."
"两人倒地而亡，一人逃跑了，四个人成功地冲过了我们的防护。在林子的掩护下，还有七八个人，每个人显然都配有好几把枪，他们一直朝木屋猛烈射击，但没什么作用。","Two had bit the dust, one had fled, four had made good their footing inside our defences, while from the shelter of the woods seven or eight men, each evidently supplied with several muskets, kept up a hot though useless fire on the log-house."
"那四个冲进防护栅栏的海盗直奔木屋而来，边跑边叫，而在树林里的人也跟着应和声援他们。我们又开了几枪，但是由于枪手们太慌张，似乎都没打中。一会儿，那四个海盗就冲上了土堆，直奔我们而来。","The four who had boarded made straight before them for the building, shouting as they ran, and the men among the trees shouted back to encourage them.Several shots were fired, but such was the hurry of the marksmen that not one appears to have taken effect.In a moment, the four pirates had swarmed up the mound and were upon us."
"水手长乔布·安德森的头出现在中间的射击孔里。","The head of Job Anderson, the boatswain, appeared at the middle loophole."
"“朝他们射击！所有人!所有人！”他用雷鸣般的声音吼道。","“At ‘em, all hands—all hands!” he roared in a voice of thunder."
"与此同时，另一个海盗抓住了亨特的枪口，从他手中猛地把枪拔出了射击孔，然后一拳就把这个可怜的人打晕在地，使他失去了知觉。同时，第三个海盗绕着木屋跑了一圈也没伤着。他突然跑到门口，用弯刀朝医生砍去。","At the same moment, another pirate grasped Hunter’s musket by the muzzle, wrenched it from his hands, plucked it through the loophole, and with one stunning blow, laid the poor fellow senseless on the floor.Meanwhile a third, running unharmed all around the house, appeared suddenly in the doorway and fell with his cutlass on the doctor."
"我们的处境完全反了。我们刚才还在掩蔽之下射击敌人，敌人暴露在外；现在我们却暴露在外，而且无还手之力。","Our position was utterly reversed.A moment since we were firing, under cover, at an exposed enemy; now it was we who lay uncovered and could not return a blow."
"木屋里全是烟，因此我们还相对安全一些。耳边响起喊声、嘈杂声，火光和枪声，还有大声的呻吟声。","The log-house was full of smoke, to which we owed our comparative safety.Cries and confusion, the flashes and reports of pistol shots, and one loud groan rang in my ears."
"“伙计们，出去！出去！在空地上和他们打！用弯刀！”船长大喊道。","“Out, lads, out, and fight ‘em in the open!Cutlasses!” cried the captain."
"我从一堆弯刀里捞出了一把，同时另一个人也抓起一把，在我指节上割了一下，我几乎没什么感觉。我冲到门外明亮的阳光下。有人紧跟在我后面，但我不知道是谁。在正前方，医生正把一个进攻者追赶到山下。当我把目光转到他身上的时候，医生打败了那家伙的防守，将他砍得仰面朝天，脸上也划了道大口子。","I snatched a cutlass from the pile, and someone, at the same time snatching another, gave me a cut across the knuckles which I hardly felt.I dashed out of the door into the clear sunlight.Someone was close behind, I knew not whom.Right in front, the doctor was pursuing his assailant down the hill, and just as my eyes fell upon him, beat down his guard and sent him sprawling on his back with a great slash across the face."
"“围着屋子！”船长大喊道。即使一片骚乱，我也能听出他的声音有些不一样。","“Round the house, lads!Round the house!” cried the captain; and even in the hurly-burly, I perceived a change in his voice."
"我机械地服从命令，举着弯刀转向东边，绕过屋角跑过去。接着，我和安德森撞了个正着。他大声吼着，把刀举过头顶，刀身在阳光下闪闪发光。我还来不及害怕，趁着弯刀还没劈下来，立刻跳到一边，脚落在松软的沙子里，头朝前滚下了山坡。","Mechanically, I obeyed, turned eastwards, and with my cutlass raised, ran round the corner of the house.Next moment I was face to face with Anderson.He roared aloud, and his hanger went up above his head, flashing in the sunlight.I had not time to be afraid, but as the blow still hung impending, leaped in a trice upon one side, and missing my foot in the soft sand, rolled headlong down the slope."
"我刚从门口突围出来，其他反叛分子已经涌上了栅栏，企图了结我们。一个戴着红睡帽的人，嘴里叼着弯刀，甚至爬到栅栏顶，伸过来了一条腿。我瞬间站起来，一切还是老样子：那个戴红睡帽的家伙还跨在栅栏上，另一个家伙的脑袋也伸出了栅栏顶。然而，就在这一瞬间，战斗结束了！胜利是属于我们的！","When I had first sallied from the door, the other mutineers had been already swarming up the palisade to make an end of us.One man, in a red night cap, with his cutlass in his mouth, had even got upon the top and thrown a leg across.Well, so short had been the interval that when I found my feet again all was in the same posture, the fellow with the red night cap still half way over, another still just showing his head above the top of the stockade.And yet, in this breath of time, the fight was over and the victory was ours."
"紧跟在我后面的格雷，将那个大个水手砍倒，自己还没从他最后一击中恢复过来。另一个海盗正要从射击孔里射向木屋，就被射中，现在正痛苦地躺在那儿，手中的枪还在冒烟。我看到第三个海盗被医生一下子就了结了。越过防护栅栏的四个人之中，只有一个还活着，他把弯刀扔在地上，怕死地往外爬。","Gray, following close behind me, had cut down the big boatswain ere he had time to recover from his last blow.Another had been shot at a loophole in the very act of firing into the house and now lay in agony, the pistol still smoking in his hand.A third, as I had seen, the doctor had disposed of at a blow.Of the four who had scaled the palisade, one only remained unaccounted for, and he, having left his cutlass on the field, was now clambering out again with the fear of death upon him."
"医生喊道：“开枪！从屋子里开枪！还有你们，伙计！快回去隐蔽。”","“Fire—fire from the house!” cried the doctor.“And you, lads, back into cover.”"
"但没人注意到他的话，也没人开枪。最后一个海盗成功地逃跑了，和其他人一起消失在林子里。三秒钟内，这群进攻的人什么也没留下，只有五个倒地而亡的人：四个在防护栅栏里面，一个在外面。","But his words were unheeded, no shot was fired, and the last boarder made good his escape and disappeared with the rest into the wood.In three seconds nothing remained of the attacking party but the five who had fallen, four on the inside and one on the outside of the palisade."
"医生、格雷和我全速跑回了木屋。存活下来的海盗可能立刻就会回到他们丢枪卸甲的地方，战斗可能随时开始。","The doctor and Gray and I ran full speed for shelter.The survivors would soon be back where they had left their muskets, and at any moment the fire might recommence."
"这时，木屋里的烟已经散得差不多了，我们一眼就可以看到我们为这场胜利付出的代价。亨特倒在自己的射击孔旁，昏迷不醒；乔伊斯在他旁边，脑袋被打穿了，不再动弹；在屋子正中，乡绅扶着船长，两人脸色惨白。","The house was by this time somewhat cleared of smoke, and we saw at a glance the price we had paid for victory.Hunter lay beside his loophole, stunned; Joyce by his, shot through the head, never to move again; while right in the centre, the squire was supporting the captain, one as pale as the other."
"“船长受伤了。”特里劳尼先生说道。","“The captain’s wounded,” said Mr. Trelawney."
"“他们跑了吗？”斯莫利特船长问道。","“Have they run?” asked Mr. Smollett."
"医生回答道：“您可以放心，虽然他们都想跑，但是有五个再也跑不了了。”","“All that could, you may be bound,” returned the doctor; “but there’s five of them will never run again.”"
"船长叫道：“五个！嗯，还好。五个对三个，剩下我们四个对九个。情况比开始的时候好多了。我们当时都以为咱们是七个对他们十九个。当时情况真是糟到家了。","“Five!” cried the captain.“Come, that’s better.Five against three leaves us four to nine.That’s better odds than we had at starting.We were seven to nineteen then, or thought we were, and that’s as bad to bear.”"
"第二十二章 我的海上历险是如何开始的","Chapter 22 How My Sea Adventure Began"
"叛乱分子再也没有回来；林子里也没有枪声了。照船长的说法，他们已经“领到了当天的口粮”，终于整个地方都归我们自己了。我们可以安静地检查伤员，准备午餐了。尽管外面很危险，我和乡绅还是在外面做饭。我们即使在屋外，也说不清自己在干什么，伤员恐怖的叫喊声不时传入耳内。","There was no return of the mutineers—not so much as another shot out of the woods.They had “got their rations for that day,” as the captain put it, and we had the place to ourselves and a quiet time to overhaul the wounded and get dinner.Squire and I cooked outside in spite of the danger, and even outside we could hardly tell what we were at, for horror of the loud groans that reached us from the doctor’s patients."
"战斗中倒下的八个人只有三个还在喘气——在射击孔前中弹的海盗、亨特和斯莫利特船长；海盗和亨特几乎和死了一样。最终，海盗死在了医生的刀下；而亨特，尽管我们已竭尽全力，还是没能醒过来。他拖了一整天，大声喘着气，就像在家时见到的中风的老海盗一样。他的胸骨被打断了，跌倒时颅骨也折了，第二天夜里毫无声息地见上帝去了。","Out of the eight men who had fallen in the action, only three still breathed—that one of the pirates who had been shot at the loophole, Hunter, and Captain Smollett; and of these, the first two were as good as dead; the mutineer indeed died under the doctor’s knife, and Hunter, do what we could, never recovered consciousness in this world.He lingered all day, breathing loudly like the old buccaneer at home in his apoplectic fit, but the bones of his chest had been crushed by the blow and his skull fractured in falling, and some time in the following night, without sign or sound, he went to his Maker."
"船长呢，他的伤确实很严重，但是没有生命危险。各个器官没有致命伤。安德森的子弹——乔布射中的第一枪——打到了船长的肩胛骨，伤到了肺部，但并不严重。第二颗子弹只是擦破了小腿肚，伤了肌肉。医生说他肯定能复原，但在接下来的几周里不能走路，也不能活动胳膊，要尽量少说话，如果他能管得住自己的话。","As for the captain, his wounds were grievous indeed, but not dangerous.No organ was fatally injured.Anderson’s ball—for it was Job that shot him first—had broken his shoulder-blade and touched the lung, not badly; the second had only torn and displaced some muscles in the calf.He was sure to recover, the doctor said, but in the meantime, and for weeks to come, he must not walk nor move his arm, nor so much as speak when he could help it."
"我指关节上的意外刀伤根本没什么事儿。利夫西医生给我涂膏药包扎好了，还扯了扯我的耳朵。","My own accidental cut across the knuckles was a flea-bite.Doctor Livesey patched it up with plaster and pulled my ears for me into the bargain."
"吃过午饭，乡绅和医生在船长旁边坐着商量了一会儿。畅谈完已过正午，医生拿起帽子和手枪，把弯刀挂在腰上，地图装进口袋，滑膛枪扛在肩上，翻过北边的栅栏，飞快地朝树林奔去。","After dinner the squire and the doctor sat by the captain’s side awhile in consultation; and when they had talked to their hearts’ content, it being then a little past noon, the doctor took up his hat and pistols, girt on a cutlass, put the chart in his pocket, and with a musket over his shoulder crossed the palisade on the north side and set off briskly through the trees."
"格雷和我一起坐在木屋的另一端，听不到我们领导人商谈了什么。格雷看到利夫西医生跑了出去，吓得嘴里的烟斗取出来就忘了放回嘴里。","Gray and I were sitting together at the far end of the block house, to be out of earshot of our officers consulting; and Gray took his pipe out of his mouth and fairly forgot to put it back again, so thunder-struck he was at this occurrence."
"他说：“哦，我的海王爷，利夫西医生疯了吗？”","“Why, in the name of Davy Jones,” said he, “is Dr. Livesey mad?”"
"我说：“不可能！我敢说，谁疯了也不可能他疯了！”","“Why no,” said I.“He’s about the last of this crew for that, I take it.”"
"格雷说：“好吧，伙计，也许他没疯。你记住我的话，如果他没疯，就是我疯了。”","“Well, shipmate,” said Gray, “mad he may not be; but if HE’S not, you mark my words, I am.”"
"我答道：“我敢说，医生有他自己的想法。如果我猜的不错，他是要去见本·冈恩。”","“I take it,” replied I, “the doctor has his idea; and if I am right, he’s going now to see Ben Gunn.”"
"事后证明我是对的。不过那时屋里热得喘不过气来，栅栏里那一小块沙地被正午的太阳晒得像要着起火来。我脑子里产生了一个新想法，一个无论怎么说都没道理的想法。我开始羡慕医生能够走在凉爽的树荫下，鸟声环绕，松香扑鼻，而我坐在这儿受煎烤，衣服上粘得发出酸味。四周全是血，尸体横陈，这地方让我又厌恶，又害怕。","I was right, as appeared later; but in the meantime, the house being stifling hot and the little patch of sand inside the palisade ablaze with midday sun, I began to get another thought into my head, which was not by any means so right.What I began to do was to envy the doctor walking in the cool shadow of the woods with the birds about him and the pleasant smell of the pines, while I sat grilling, with my clothes stuck to the hot resin, and so much blood about me and so many poor dead bodies lying all around that I took a disgust of the place that was almost as strong as fear."
"我一直在清洗木屋，然后洗餐具，越洗越厌恶，心里的厌恶和嫉妒也更加强烈。到最后，在面包袋前，趁没人注意我，我做了逃走的第一步，往上衣两个口袋里装满了干面包。","All the time I was washing out the block house, and then washing up the things from dinner, this disgust and envy kept growing stronger and stronger, till at last, being near a bread-bag, and no one then observing me, I took the first step towards my escapade and filled both pockets of my coat with biscuit."
"我是个蠢人，如果你愿意这么想的话，我当然会做出愚蠢、鲁莽的事，但我决定尽力做到小心谨慎。即使出了事，这些干面包至少也能使我两天内不会挨饿。","I was a fool, if you like, and certainly I was going to do a foolish, over-bold act; but I was determined to do it with all the precautions in my power.These biscuits, should anything befall me, would keep me, at least, from starving till far on in the next day."
"我弄到手的第二件东西是两把手枪，加上我原有的牛角火药筒和几发子弹，我觉得自己武装得很好了。","The next thing I laid hold of was a brace of pistols, and as I already had a powder-horn and bullets, I felt myself well supplied with arms."
"实际我脑子里的打算本身还算不错。我打算走到东边那个分开锚地和海洋的海角，找到前一天傍晚看到的白色岩石，查看一下本·冈恩的小船是否还藏在那儿。我现在仍然认为这事值得一试。但是我敢肯定他们决不允许我离开寨子，我唯一的办法就是不告而别，趁没人注意的时候偷偷溜走。这种做法不对，使得整件事都不对了。可我当时毕竟是个小孩子，而且还拿定了主意。","As for the scheme I had in my head, it was not a bad one in itself.I was to go down the sandy spit that divides the anchorage on the east from the open sea, find the white rock I had observed last evening, and ascertain whether it was there or not that Ben Gunn had hidden his boat, a thing quite worth doing, as I still believe.But as I was certain I should not be allowed to leave the enclosure, my only plan was to take French leave and slip out when nobody was watching, and that was so bad a way of doing it as made the thing itself wrong.But I was only a boy, and I had made my mind up."
"就这样，到最后，我终于找到了个好机会。乡绅和格雷正忙着帮船长系绷带，我趁机翻过防护栅栏，钻进了茂密的树林。在别人发现我不见了之前，我就跑到同伴们的喊声之外了。","Well, as things at last fell out, I found an admirable opportunity.The squire and Gray were busy helping the captain with his bandages, the coast was clear, I made a bolt for it over the stockade and into the thickest of the trees, and before my absence was observed I was out of cry of my companions."
"这是我的第二次冒失行为，而且比第一次还要顽劣得多，因为我只留下两个没受伤的人守着木屋。然而跟第一次一样，这次我也救了大家。","This was my second folly, far worse than the first, as I left but two sound men to guard the house; but like the first, it was a help towards saving all of us."
"我一直朝着海岛东岸走去，因为我决定沿着海角靠海的那边走下去，以免被抛锚处的人发现。这时天色已晚，但天气还很暖和、晴朗。我在高大的树林中继续穿行时，不仅可以听到远处持续的浪涛拍岸的轰鸣声，还可以听到树叶摆动的簌簌声和树枝摇曳的沙沙声，这表明海风比平时要猛。不一会儿，凉风朝我吹来，几步之后，我走到树林边缘的开阔地，看到大海一片蔚蓝，在阳光下伸向天边，起伏翻腾的海浪将泡沫拍打在海岸上。","I took my way straight for the east coast of the island, for I was determined to go down the sea side of the spit to avoid all chance of observation from the anchorage.It was already late in the afternoon, although still warm and sunny.As I continued to thread the tall woods, I could hear from far before me not only the continuous thunder of the surf, but a certain tossing of foliage and grinding of boughs which showed me the sea breeze had set in higher than usual.Soon cool draughts of air began to reach me, and a few steps farther I came forth into the open borders of the grove, and saw the sea lying blue and sunny to the horizon and the surf tumbling and tossing its foam along the beach."
"我从未见到过金银岛附近的海如此平静。烈日当空，没有一丝风，海面蔚蓝、平静，但岸边的巨浪仍是拍打个不停，日夜发出轰隆的声音。我相信这岛上可能没一个地方的人听不到这种雷鸣般的声音。","I have never seen the sea quiet round Treasure Island.The sun might blaze overhead, the air be without a breath, the surface smooth and blue, but still these great rollers would be running along all the external coast, thundering and thundering by day and night; and I scarce believe there is one spot in the island where a man would be out of earshot of their noise."
"我高兴地沿着浪涛拍打的海岸走着，直到觉得自己已经向南走了足够远，才在茂密的灌木丛掩护下，小心翼翼地爬上那个海角的斜坡。","I walked along beside the surf with great enjoyment, till, thinking I was now got far enough to the south, I took the cover of some thick bushes and crept warily up to the ridge of the spit."
"我背对大海，正对着锚地。海风似乎来得猛也去得快，已经停了下来，接着是明亮、多变的气流，来自东面和东南面，带来了大片雾气。位于骷髅岛背风处的锚地与我们当初进来时一样平静、阴郁。伊斯帕尼奥拉号停在平静如镜的海面上，从桅杆到吃水线都清楚地映在水中，桅杆上挂着乔利·罗杰的骷髅旗。","Behind me was the sea, in front the anchorage.The sea breeze, as though it had the sooner blown itself out by its unusual violence, was already at an end; it had been succeeded by light, variable airs from the south and south-east, carrying great banks of fog; and the anchorage, under lee of Skeleton Island, lay still and leaden as when first we entered it.The HISPANIOLA, in that unbroken mirror, was exactly portrayed from the truck to the waterline, the Jolly Roger hanging from her peak."
"旁边停靠着一艘小船，西尔弗坐在船尾，我一眼就认出了他。还有两个人斜靠在船尾舷墙上，其中一个戴着红睡帽，正是几小时前跨在护栏上的那个坏蛋。　隔着一英里那么远，我能看到他们明显在说笑，但听不到他们在说什么。突然，我听到声极其恐怖的怪叫，一开始把我吓得够呛，但我很快就想起那是叫“弗林特船长”的鹦鹉在叫。她蹲在主人的手腕上，我看到她亮丽的羽毛就认出来了。","Alongside lay one of the gigs, Silver in the stern-sheets—him I could always recognize—while a couple of men were leaning over the stern bulwarks, one of them with a red cap—the very rogue that I had seen some hours before stride-legs upon the palisade.Apparently they were talking and laughing, though at that distance—upwards of a mile—I could, of course, hear no word of what was said.All at once there began the most horrid, unearthly screaming, which at first startled me badly, though I had soon remembered the voice of Captain Flint and even thought I could make out the bird by her bright plumage as she sat perched upon her master’s wrist."
"不一会，小船离开大船，驶向岸边，戴红睡帽那家伙也和同伙在船舱的升降口走了下去。","Soon after, the jolly boat shoved off and pulled for shore, and the man with the red cap and his comrade went below by the cabin companion."
"就在这时，太阳落到了望远镜山后面，雾气迅速开始聚集，天真的开始黑了下来。我明白，如果我想在今晚找到小船的话，就一定不能浪费时间。","Just about the same time, the sun had gone down behind the Spy-glass, and as the fog was collecting rapidly, it began to grow dark in earnest.I saw I must lose no time if I were to find the boat that evening."
"虽然树丛里的白色岩石清晰可见，但它还在离我有八分之一英里远的海角那边。我又花了好长时间才到那儿，而且经常是手脚并用，爬过灌木丛。当我的手触到粗糙的岩壁时，天几乎全黑了。岩石的正下方有个长着绿草皮的小块洼地，藏在沙洲和茂密、及膝高的灌木丛中。洼地中间果然有个山羊皮的小帐篷，有点像吉普赛人带到英格兰的那种。","The white rock, visible enough above the brush, was still some eighth of a mile further down the spit, and it took me a goodish while to get up with it, crawling, often on all fours, among the scrub.Night had almost come when I laid my hand on its rough sides.Right below it there was an exceedingly small hollow of green turf, hidden by banks and a thick underwood about knee-deep, that grew there very plentifully; and in the centre of the dell, sure enough, a little tent of goat-skins, like what the gipsies carry about with them in England."
"我跳进洼地，掀开帐篷的一角，看到了本·冈恩的小船，地地道道的手工制品。小船的框架用粗糙的硬木制成，外面蒙了张山羊皮，毛朝里。船实在太小了，即使对我来说都很小，简直难以想象它怎么能载得了一个成人。船上的横坐板低得不能再低，船头有个类似挡板之类的东西，还有一对划桨。","I dropped into the hollow, lifted the side of the tent, and there was Ben Gunn’s boat—home-made if ever anything was home-made; a rude, lop sided framework of tough wood, and stretched upon that a covering of goat skin, with the hair inside.The thing was extremely small, even for me, and I can hardly imagine that it could have floated with a full-sized man.There was one thwart set as low as possible, a kind of stretcher in the bows, and a double paddle for propulsion."
"我以前从没见过像古代不列颠人造的那种兽皮小船，但现在我看到了。公平地说，本·冈恩这条兽皮小船是人类能造出来的最原始、最糟糕的船。这条船有个很大的优点，它极其轻便。","I had not then seen a coracle, such as the ancient Britons made, but I have seen one since, and I can give you no fairer idea of Ben Gunn’s boat than by saying it was like the first and the worst coracle ever made by man.But the great advantage of the coracle it certainly possessed, for it was exceedingly light and portable."
"现在既然已找到了小船，你也许以为我玩够了就该回去了。但这时我又有了个主意，而且超级喜欢这个想法，一定要实行。我相信，即使是斯莫利特船长本人也阻止不了我。我的主意是在夜幕掩护下偷偷溜到伊斯帕尼奥拉号那儿，割断锚索，让她随便漂走。我心中认定，那些叛乱分子早晨被击退后，心中最渴望的就是早点出海。我想，自己要是能阻止他们逃跑就太好了。现在，我看到他们丢下的看守人连条小船都没有，就认为这事也不怎么危险。","Well, now that I had found the boat, you would have thought I had had enough of truantry for once, but in the meantime I had taken another notion and become so obstinately fond of it that I would have carried it out, I believe, in the teeth of Captain Smollett himself.This was to slip out under cover of the night, cut the HISPANIOLA adrift, and let her go ashore where she fancied.I had quite made up my mind that the mutineers, after their repulse of the morning, had nothing nearer their hearts than to up anchor and away to sea; this, I thought, it would be a fine thing to prevent, and now that I had seen how they left their watchmen unprovided with a boat, I thought it might be done with little risk."
"我坐下来一边等天黑，一边大快朵颐，吃干面包。对我的计划来说，今晚是个千载难逢的机会。浓雾已经吞没了整个世界。当天空最后一丝光亮慢慢消失之后，金银岛终于完全笼罩在一片漆黑之中。最后，当我扛着小船，摇晃着摸索出通向刚才吃饭的洼地的路时，整个锚地只有两点亮光。","Down I sat to wait for darkness, and made a hearty meal of biscuit.It was a night out of ten thousand for my purpose.The fog had now buried all heaven.As the last rays of daylight dwindled and disappeared, absolute blackness settled down on Treasure Island.And when, at last, I shouldered the coracle and groped my way stumblingly out of the hollow where I had supped, there were but two points visible on the whole anchorage."
"一处是岸边的大火堆，打败仗的海盗们正在沼泽地旁狂欢作乐。另一处是黑暗中模模糊糊的微光，它标志着抛锚的大船所在的位置。大船在退潮时转了个方向，船头正对着我。因为船上唯一的光亮来自船舱，所以我看到的只是从尾窗射出来的强光在雾中的反射。退潮已有一段时间，我只好涉水走在长长的沙滩上，好几次脚都陷进沙子里了，最后才走到退水的地方。又往水里走了几步，稍稍用力就麻利地把小船平放在水面上了。","One was the great fire on shore, by which the defeated pirates lay carousing in the swamp.The other, a mere blur of light upon the darkness, indicated the position of the anchored ship.She had swung round to the ebb—her bow was now towards me—the only lights on board were in the cabin, and what I saw was merely a reflection on the fog of the strong rays that flowed from the stern window.The ebb had already run some time, and I had to wade through a long belt of swampy sand, where I sank several times above the ankle, before I came to the edge of the retreating water, and wading a little way in, with some strength and dexterity, set my coracle, keel downwards, on the surface."
"第二十三章 退潮","Chapter 23 The Ebb-tide Runs "
"在我还没有处置这个小船之前，我有充分的理由认为她对我这样的身高体重来说非常安全，航行时轻巧又灵活。但她划起来特别难控制，老是偏向一边。无论你怎么做，她总是比什么都灵活，而她的绝活儿就是来回打转。甚至本·冈恩自己也承认这船“很难操纵，除非你摸清她的脾气”。","The coracle—as I had ample reason to know before I was done with her—was a very safe boat for a person of my height and weight, both buoyant and clever in a seaway; but she was the most cross-grained, lop-sided craft to manage.Do as you pleased, she always made more leeway than anything else, and turning round and round was the manoeuvre she was best at.Even Ben Gunn himself has admitted that she was “queer to handle till you knew her way.”"
"当然，我可不知道她的脾气。她四处乱转，就是不转到我要去的方向。大部分时间总是舷侧向前，要不是潮水帮忙，我敢保证我永远也到不了大船旁。因为运气好，无论我怎么划，潮水总是把我往下冲，而伊斯帕尼奥拉号就停在航道上，绝对不会错过。","Certainly I did not know her way.She turned in every direction but the one I was bound to go; the most part of the time we were broadside on, and I am very sure I never should have made the ship at all but for the tide.By good fortune, paddle as I pleased, the tide was still sweeping me down; and there lay the HISPANIOLA right in the fairway, hardly to be missed."
"起初，大船一团漆黑地出现在我面前，然后桅杆、船身开始显出形状来。紧接着（我越往前划，退潮越快），我到了大船的绳索旁，就赶紧抓住绳索。","First she loomed before me like a blot of something yet blacker than darkness, then her spars and hull began to take shape, and the next moment, as it seemed (for, the farther I went, the brisker grew the current of the ebb), I was alongside of her hawser and had laid hold."
"缆绳绷得像弓一样紧，拔起锚来得特别费力气。黑暗中，起起伏伏的潮水像山间的小溪一样，在大船四周翻着泡沫，汩汩作响。只要用水手刀割一下，伊斯帕尼奥拉号就会被潮水冲走。","The hawser was as taut as a bowstring, and the current so strong she pulled upon her anchor.All round the hull, in the blackness, the rippling current bubbled and chattered like a little mountain stream.One cut with my sea-gully and the HISPANIOLA would go humming down the tide."
"到现在为止，一切顺利，但我突然想到，绷紧的锚索突然被砍断的话，就会像发疯的野马一样危险。如果我鲁莽地砍断了伊斯帕尼奥拉号的锚索，我和小船很可能会弹出水面。","So far so good, but it next occurred to my recollection that a taut hawser, suddenly cut, is a thing as dangerous as a kicking horse.Ten to one, if I were so foolhardy as to cut the HISPANIOLA from her anchor, I and the coracle would be knocked clean out of the water."
"我想想就停了下来，如果不是运气好，我可能就只好放弃我的计划了。天黑之后，从东南方和南方吹来的微风变成了西南风。就在我想这件事的时候，一阵风把伊斯帕尼奥拉号高高冲进潮水里，我很兴奋，因为突然感到手里紧抓的锚索变松了，握着锚索的手一下子就浸到水里了。","This brought me to a full stop, and if fortune had not again particularly favoured me, I should have had to abandon my design.But the light airs which had begun blowing from the south-east and south had hauled round after nightfall into the south-west.Just while I was meditating, a puff came, caught the HISPANIOLA, and forced her up into the current; and to my great joy, I felt the hawser slacken in my grasp, and the hand by which I held it dip for a second under water."
"于是我决定掏出水手刀，用牙打开刀，开始一股一股地割缆绳，直到锚索只剩下两小股。然后我停下来等下阵风吹过来，使锚索再松一些，然后割断剩下的。","With that I made my mind up, took out my gully, opened it with my teeth, and cut one strand after another, till the vessel swung only by two.Then I lay quiet, waiting to sever these last when the strain should be once more lightened by a breath of wind."
"这段时间里，我听到船舱里有人大声说话，但是说实在的，我脑子里一直想别的，没怎么注意听。然而，现在我没别的事可做，就开始留意听了。","All this time I had heard the sound of loud voices from the cabin, but to say truth, my mind had been so entirely taken up with other thoughts that I had scarcely given ear.Now, however, when I had nothing else to do, I began to pay more heed."
"我听出来一个是舵手伊斯雷尔·汉兹，过去他是弗林特手下的炮手。另一个，当然就是那个戴红睡帽的老相识。他俩显然都喝了很多酒，但还在继续喝，因为就在我偷听的时候，他们中的一个还醉醺醺地大喊一声，打开舷窗，扔出一个东西，我估计是个空酒瓶。他们不仅喝醉了，而且显然还很气愤。咒骂声像冰雹一样，时不时还会大发雷霆，让我以为他们一定会打起来。但每次吵一会儿都会停下，叫骂声变成小声嘟囔。一会儿新的危机又出现，但还会毫无结果地过去。","One I recognized for the coxswain’s, Israel Hands, that had been Flint’s gunner in former days.The other was, of course, my friend of the red night-cap.Both men were plainly the worse of drink, and they were still drinking, for even while I was listening, one of them, with a drunken cry, opened the stern window and threw out something, which I divined to be an empty bottle.But they were not only tipsy; it was plain that they were furiously angry.Oaths flew like hailstones, and every now and then there came forth such an explosion as I thought was sure to end in blows.But each time the quarrel passed off and the voices grumbled lower for a while, until the next crisis came and in its turn passed away without result."
"在海边，我可以看到从岸边的树丛中透出的红光，那是燃烧的篝火。有人在唱一首沉闷、单调的水手老歌，每句结尾处都要降低调子发颤音，似乎只要唱歌的人有耐心就可以一直唱下去。我在航行中听过很多次，还记得这些歌词：","On shore, I could see the glow of the great camp-fire burning warmly through the shore-side trees.Someone was singing, a dull, old, droning sailor’s song, with a droop and a quaver at the end of every verse, and seemingly no end to it at all but the patience of the singer.I had heard it on the voyage more than once and remembered these words: "
"“只剩一个人活着回来，当时七十五个人出海。”"," “But one man of her crew alive, What put to sea with seventy-five.”"
"我认为这对早上伤亡惨重的海盗来说是再合适不过了。但说实在的，从我看到的来说，这些海盗和他们所航行的大海一样麻木无情。","And I thought it was a ditty rather too dolefully appropriate for a company that had met such cruel losses in the morning.But, indeed, from what I saw, all these buccaneers were as callous as the sea they sailed on."
"终于，我等的那阵风来了，大船在黑暗中侧着船身，离我更近了。我感到锚索又松了一些，就费力地割断了最后两股绳。","At last the breeze came; the schooner sidled and drew nearer in the dark; I felt the hawser slacken once more, and with a good, tough effort, cut the last fibres through."
"这阵风对我的小船没什么影响，我几乎立刻就被推着向伊斯帕尼奥拉号撞去。与此同时，大船开始转身，在急流中首尾完全掉了个方向。","The breeze had but little action on the coracle, and I was almost instantly swept against the bows of the HISPANIOLA.At the same time, the schooner began to turn upon her heel, spinning slowly, end for end, across the current."
"我拼命地划着小船，时刻担心被撞翻。我发现怎么也不能把小船划离大船，就径直向大船船尾划去。我终于逃离了危险。正当我划最后一下时，我的手碰到了从大船后舷上垂下来的细绳。我立刻抓住绳子。","I wrought like a fiend, for I expected every moment to be swamped; and since I found I could not push the coracle directly off, I now shoved straight astern.At length I was clear of my dangerous neighbour, and just as I gave the last impulsion, my hands came across a light cord that was trailing overboard across the stern bulwarks.Instantly I grasped it."
"我也说不出为什么会那么做。一开始只是出于本能，可一旦抓到手里，发现绳系得很牢，好奇心便占了上风。于是，我决定向大船的窗户里看看。","Why I should have done so I can hardly say.It was at first mere instinct, but once I had it in my hands and found it fast, curiosity began to get the upper hand, and I determined I should have one look through the cabin window."
"我双手交替着往绳子上爬，当我觉得够近的时候，就冒险伸出半个身子，刚好可以看到舱顶和舱内一块儿。","I pulled in hand over hand on the cord, and when I judged myself near enough, rose at infinite risk to about half my height and thus commanded the roof and a slice of the interior of the cabin."
"这时大船和小船正迅速滑过水面。实际上，我们的位置已经和篝火一般齐了。按水手的说法，大船正在“大声说话”，也就是哗哗地踏过层层波浪。直到我在窗棂之上往里看了一眼，才明白为什么留守的人毫不警觉。然而，我看一眼也就够了，而且小船这么晃，我也只能看一眼。我看到汉兹和同伙正扭作一团作殊死搏斗，两人都用手掐着对方的脖子。","By this time the schooner and her little consort were gliding pretty swiftly through the water; indeed, we had already fetched up level with the camp-fire.The ship was talking, as sailors say, loudly, treading the innumerable ripples with an incessant weltering splash; and until I got my eye above the window-sill I could not comprehend why the watchmen had taken no alarm.One glance, however, was sufficient; and it was only one glance that I durst take from that unsteady skiff.It showed me Hands and his companion locked together in deadly wrestle, each with a hand upon the other’s throat."
"我又跳回小船，差点儿掉下去我一时什么也看不见，只有两张愤怒、通红的脸在冒烟的油灯下晃动。我闭上眼睛努力适应黑暗。","I dropped upon the thwart again, none too soon, for I was near overboard.I could see nothing for the moment but these two furious, encrimsoned faces swaying together under the smoky lamp, and I shut my eyes to let them grow once more familiar with the darkness."
"没完没了的歌声终于停下来。篝火旁受损的海盗们齐声唱起了我听无数次的曲子：“十五个人站在聚魂棺上——呦——嗬——嗬——还有一瓶朗姆酒！ 酒和魔鬼带走了其余的人——呦——嗬——嗬——还有一瓶朗姆酒！”","The endless ballad had come to an end at last, and the whole diminished company about the camp-fire had broken into the chorus I had heard so often:  “Fifteen men on the dead man’s chest-Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!Drink and the devil had done for the rest-Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!”"
"我正想着酒和魔鬼在这伊斯帕尼奥拉号的船舱里是多么繁忙的时候，小船突然倾斜，吓了我一跳。就在这时，小船突然转弯，好像要改变航向。同时船也突然加速了。","I was just thinking how busy drink and the devil were at that very moment in the cabin of the HISPANIOLA, when I was surprised by a sudden lurch of the coracle.At the same moment, she yawed sharply and seemed to change her course.The speed in the meantime had strangely increased."
"我立刻睁开眼睛。我的周围全是细小的波浪，伴随着刺耳的水声和微光。伊斯帕尼奥拉号离我几码远，我还身处她后面的漩涡中，而她本身似乎也在摇晃着改变方向。我看到她的桅杆在漆黑的夜幕中晃了一下。又观察了一会儿，我肯定大船正在转向南方。","I opened my eyes at once.All round me were little ripples, combing over with a sharp, bristling sound and slightly phosphorescent.The HISPANIOLA herself, a few yards in whose wake I was still being whirled along, seemed to stagger in her course, and I saw her spars toss a little against the blackness of the night; nay, as I looked longer, I made sure she also was wheeling to the southward."
"我回头望了一下，吓得我差点连心都跳了出来。正对我背后的就是红红的篝火。水流转了九十度，将高高的大船和摇摆的小船一起卷走了。浪头越来越急，越来越高，声音也越来越大。急流旋转着冲过狭窄的隘口流向宽阔的海洋。","I glanced over my shoulder, and my heart jumped against my ribs.There, right behind me, was the glow of the camp-fire.The current had turned at right angles, sweeping round along with it the tall schooner and the little dancing coracle; ever quickening, ever bubbling higher, ever muttering louder, it went spinning through the narrows for the open sea."
"突然，我前面的大船突然一偏，方向大约改了二十度。几乎就在同时，船上传来两声惨叫。我可以听到升降口楼梯上的脚步声，知道那两个醉鬼终于停止争吵，清醒地意识到眼前的灾难了。","Suddenly the schooner in front of me gave a violent yaw, turning, perhaps, through twenty degrees; and almost at the same moment one shout followed another from on board; I could hear feet pounding on the companion ladder and I knew that the two drunkards had at last been interrupted in their quarrel and awakened to a sense of their disaster."
"我趴在这个破破烂烂的小船底部，完全听从命运安排。到海角尽头的时候，我肯定我们会葬身惊涛骇浪之中，那样我所有的麻烦立刻就没了。虽然我也许不怕死，但却害怕眼睁睁看着厄运当头。","I lay down flat in the bottom of that wretched skiff and devoutly recommended my spirit to its Maker.At the end of the straits, I made sure we must fall into some bar of raging breakers, where all my troubles would be ended speedily; and though I could, perhaps, bear to die, I could not bear to look upon my fate as it approached."
"我就这样在小船上趴了几个小时，不断地被巨浪打来打去，不时地被飞溅的浪花打湿，时刻担心下一个巨浪会要了自己的命。我觉得越来越累，渐渐麻木了，甚至在恐惧中也慢慢睡着了。我躺在海浪中的小船里，梦见了家，还梦见了“本博上将”的老店。","So I must have lain for hours, continually beaten to and fro upon the billows, now and again wetted with flying sprays, and never ceasing to expect death at the next plunge.Gradually weariness grew upon me; a numbness, an occasional stupor, fell upon my mind even in the midst of my terrors, until sleep at last supervened and in my sea-tossed coracle I lay and dreamed of home and the old Admiral Benbow."
"第二十四章 小船巡洋","Chapter 24 The Cruise of the Coracle"
"我醒来的时候已经是大白天，发现自己在金银岛西南边缘的海面上漂着。太阳已经升起来了，但仍被高高的望远镜山挡着，我看不到。望远镜山的这边是直插入海的峭壁。","It was broad day when I awoke and found myself tossing at the south-west end of Treasure Island.The sun was up but was still hid from me behind the great bulk of the Spy-glass, which on this side descended almost to the sea in formidable cliffs."
"帆索岬和后桅山近在咫尺。后桅山又秃又黑；帆索岬周围是四五十英尺高的峭壁，还散落着大堆滚落的岩石。我离海岸不到四分之一英里，第一个念头就是要划到岸上去。","Haulbowline Head and Mizzen-mast Hill were at my elbow, the hill bare and dark, the head bound with cliffs forty or fifty feet high and fringed with great masses of fallen rock.I was scarce a quarter of a mile to seaward, and it was my first thought to paddle in and land."
"但我很快就放弃了那个想法。巨浪不断地咆哮着打向那些滚落的岩石，响声震天，水花飞溅，一个浪接着一个浪地打过来。我很明白，如果我冒险靠近一些，要么会在凹凸不平的岩石上摔死，要么就是累死也爬不上悬崖。","That notion was soon given over.Among the fallen rocks the breakers spouted and bellowed; loud reverberations, heavy sprays flying and falling, succeeded one another from second to second; and I saw myself, if I ventured nearer, dashed to death upon the rough shore or spending my strength in vain to scale the beetling crags."
"不仅如此，我还看到许多粘乎乎的怪物，好像是软体蜗牛，但却硕大无比。有的在平坦的岩石上爬行，有的咕咚掉进海里。一共有五六十只，狂叫的回声响彻悬崖间。","Nor was that all, for crawling together on flat tables of rock or letting themselves drop into the sea with loud reports I beheld huge slimy monsters—soft snails, as it were, of incredible bigness—two or three score of them together, making the rocks to echo with their barkings."
"后来我才知道那些怪物是海狮，根本不伤人。但它们的长相，加上海岸的艰险和海浪的汹涌，使我对这个登陆点厌恶无比。我宁可在海上饿死也不愿面对这些危险。","I have understood since that they were sea lions, and entirely harmless.But the look of them, added to the difficulty of the shore and the high running of the surf, was more than enough to disgust me of that landing-place.I felt willing rather to starve at sea than to confront such perils."
"这时，我觉得面前有个更好的机会。帆索岬的北边陆地延伸到很远，退潮后留下一段长长的黄色沙滩。从那儿再往北又是另一个海角——“丛林海角”，根据地图标注，它被掩盖在一片长到岸边的高大青松里。","In the meantime I had a better chance, as I supposed, before me.North of Haulbowline Head, the land runs in a long way, leaving at low tide a long stretch of yellow sand.To the north of that, again, there comes another cape—Cape of the Woods, as it was marked upon the chart buried in tall green pines, which descended to the margin of the sea."
"我记得西尔弗曾说过，在金银岛的整个西岸有一股向北的洋流。从我的位置来看，我已经受到它的影响了，所以决定放弃帆索岬，保留体力，试图从稍微容易些的“丛林海角”登陆。","I remembered what Silver had said about the current that sets northward along the whole west coast of Treasure Island, and seeing from my position that I was already under its influence, I preferred to leave Haulbowline Head behind me and reserve my strength for an attempt to land upon the kindlier-looking Cape of the Woods."
"海面大片波纹荡漾。南风温柔地吹向海面上的波纹，海浪起伏个不停。","There was a great, smooth swell upon the sea.The wind blowing steady and gentle from the south, there was no contrariety between that and the current, and the billows rose and fell unbroken."
"如果不是这样，我早就被海浪吞噬了，但即使如此，我这条小木船能如此轻易地脱险还是令人吃惊。我一直躺在船底，睁着一只眼掠过船舷，看到蓝蓝的巨浪涌向头顶，然而小船只是稍微一跃，就像装了弹簧一样，退落到浪涡处，轻快地像只小鸟。","Had it been otherwise, I must long ago have perished; but as it was, it is surprising how easily and securely my little and light boat could ride.Often, as I still lay at the bottom and kept no more than an eye above the gunwale, I would see a big blue summit heaving close above me; yet the coracle would but bounce a little, dance as if on springs, and subside on the other side into the trough as lightly as a bird."
"过了一会儿，我胆子大了一些，坐起来试着划桨。但只要我身体重心稍微改变一下，就会对这条小船产生巨大的影响。我稍微动了一下，小船就改变了轻盈的运动，径直向一个浪谷滑去，那么险峻，吓得我头晕。接着，船头突然扎进了一个浪涛深处，溅起一阵浪花。","I began after a little to grow very bold and sat up to try my skill at paddling.But even a small change in the disposition of the weight will produce violent changes in the behaviour of a coracle.And I had hardly moved before the boat, giving up at once her gentle dancing movement, ran straight down a slope of water so steep that it made me giddy, and struck her nose, with a spout of spray, deep into the side of the next wave."
"我全身湿透了，又很害怕，立刻又重新躺回去。小船似乎又明白过来，载着我在海浪中轻柔起伏前行，跟以前一样。显然，我最好不要管她，可如果我不能调整航向，又怎能希望她靠岸呢？","I was drenched and terrified, and fell instantly back into my old position, whereupon the coracle seemed to find her head again and led me as softly as before among the billows.It was plain she was not to be interfered with, and at that rate, since I could in no way influence her course, what hope had I left of reaching land?"
"我越来越害怕，但还是努力保持镇定。我先是小心地用水手帽将小船里的水一点一点舀出去，然后又往船舷外望去，开始研究小船是怎样在海浪中平静行驶的。","I began to be horribly frightened, but I kept my head, for all that.First, moving with all care, I gradually baled out the coracle with my sea-cap; then, getting my eye once more above the gunwale, I set myself to study how it was she managed to slip so quietly through the rollers."
"我发现，从岸上或甲板上看，每个浪头都像平坦光滑的大山，但实际更像陆地上起伏的山丘，有峰顶，也有平地和山谷。如果让小船自己航行，她会从一头转向另一头，穿过低地，避开陡陡的波面和冲刷而下高高的波峰。","I found each wave, instead of the big, smooth glossy mountain it looks from shore or from a vessel’s deck, was for all the world like any range of hills on dry land, full of peaks and smooth places and valleys.The coracle, left to herself, turning from side to side, threaded, so to speak, her way through these lower parts and avoided the steep slopes and higher, toppling summits of the wave."
"我心想：“现在，我显然还得躺在老地方，别打乱船的平衡，而且我可以时不时地把桨放在船边，在平静的地方向岸边划两下。”","“Well, now,”thought I to myself, “it is plain I must lie where I am and not disturb the balance; but it is plain also that I can put the paddle over the side and from time to time, in smooth places, give her a shove or two towards land.”"
"想到哪就做哪。我竭尽全力支起胳膊，时不时地轻轻划上两下，使船头靠向海岸。","No sooner thought upon than done.There I lay on my elbows in the most trying attitude, and every now and again gave a weak stroke or two to turn her head to shore."
"这活儿特别辛苦，见效也慢，但我确实看到了效果。当我靠近“丛林海角”时发现自己肯定是错过了登陆点，但我还是向东划了几百码。我确实已经很接近陆地。我能看见微风中摇曳的绿色树梢，相信自己一定会找到下一个登陆点。","It was very tiring and slow work, yet I did visibly gain ground; and as we drew near the Cape of the Woods, though I saw I must infallibly miss that point, I had still made some hundred yards of easting.I was, indeed, close in.I could see the cool green tree-tops swaying together in the breeze, and I felt sure I should make the next promontory without fail."
"是该上岸了，我现在就开始觉得渴得难受。海面上反射出的太阳光像热了几千倍。打在身上的海水晒干后盐就粘在嘴上，使我喉咙烧得慌，头也很是疼痛。眼中的树林看着很近，但却使我难以到达，海浪又很快把我冲过海角。当我到达海角另一边开阔的海面时，看到的景象使我改变了原来的想法。","It was high time, for I now began to be tortured with thirst.The glow of the sun from above, its thousandfold reflection from the waves, the sea-water that fell and dried upon me, caking my very lips with salt, combined to make my throat burn and my brain ache.The sight of the trees so near at hand had almost made me sick with longing, but the current had soon carried me past the point, and as the next reach of sea opened out, I beheld a sight that changed the nature of my thoughts."
"在我正前方不到半英里处，我看见伊斯帕尼奥拉号正在航行。我当然知道自己可能被抓，但我实在太想喝水了，都不知道被抓是该高兴还是该难过。我还没来得及想明白，就被眼前的景象吓呆了，瞪大眼睛想着是怎么回事。","Right in front of me, not half a mile away, I beheld the HISPANIOLA under sail.I made sure, of course, that I should be taken; but I was so distressed for want of water that I scarce knew whether to be glad or sorry at the thought, and long before I had come to a conclusion, surprise had taken entire possession of my mind and I could do nothing but stare and wonder."
"伊斯帕尼奥拉号扯着主帆和两个大三角帆前进，美丽的白帆在阳光下像雪和白银一样闪闪发光。当我第一眼看到她的时候，所有的帆都鼓满着风，航向西北。我猜想船上的人是要绕过小岛，回到锚地。现在她却逐渐往西偏，因此我想他们一定是看到我，追来抓我了。然而，最后她却掉过头，逆着风，无奈地停在那儿不动了，船帆一直颤抖。","The HISPANIOLA was under her main-sail and two jibs, and the beautiful white canvas shone in the sun like snow or silver.When I first sighted her, all her sails were drawing; she was lying a course about north-west, and I presumed the men on board were going round the island on their way back to the anchorage.Presently she began to fetch more and more to the westward, so that I thought they had sighted me and were going about in chase.At last, however, she fell right into the wind’s eye, was taken dead aback, and stood there awhile helpless, with her sails shivering."
"我自言自语道：“一堆蠢人！他们一定还醉得像死猪一样。”","“Clumsy fellows,” said I; “they must still be drunk as owls.”"
"我心想斯莫利特船长得怎么痛骂他们呀！"," And I thought how Captain Smollett would have set them skipping."
"这时，大船又慢慢转了起来，船帆重新鼓起，飞快地航行了一分钟左右，然后又转到逆风方向不动了。这样重复了好几次。伊斯帕尼奥拉号时而前后摇晃，时而上下起伏，冲着东南西北四个方向乱撞。重复一次停一次，剩下船帆噼啪作响。很明显，这船没人驾驶。如果是这样，人都哪儿去了呢？要么他们醉得半死，要么就已经弃船走了，我想如果自己能登上大船的话，我可以把船重新交给船长。","Meanwhile the schooner gradually fell off and filled again upon another tack, sailed swiftly for a minute or so, and brought up once more dead in the wind’s eye.Again and again was this repeated.To and fro, up and down, north, south, east, and west, the HISPANIOLA sailed by swoops and dashes, and at each repetition ended as she had begun, with idly flapping canvas.It became plain to me that nobody was steering.And if so, where were the men?Either they were dead drunk or had deserted her, I thought, and perhaps if I could get on board I might return the vessel to her captain."
"海浪带着大船和小船同速向南航进。但大船的航行毫无规律、时断时续，而且每次打转都停好一段时间，即使没后退，也绝对没前进。我要是敢坐起来划船的话，我敢肯定能追上她。这个冒险的想法刺激着我，再想着前面升降口旁的淡水桶，又给我增添了勇气。","The current was bearing coracle and schooner southward at an equal rate.As for the latter’s sailing, it was so wild and intermittent, and she hung each time so long in irons, that she certainly gained nothing, if she did not even lose.If only I dared to sit up and paddle, I made sure that I could overhaul her.The scheme had an air of adventure that inspired me, and the thought of the water breaker beside the fore companion doubled my growing courage."
"我刚坐起来，几乎立刻就被浪花打上了，但这次我决定全力以赴、小心谨慎地划向无人驾驶的伊斯帕尼奥拉号。有一次，大浪打了很多水进来，我只好停下船舀水，心像揣着小兔子一样怦怦直跳。但我逐渐掌握了这个小船的脾气，能够划着小船在风浪中前行，只是时不时被船头打进的浪花溅起的泡沫喷一脸。","Up I got, was welcomed almost instantly by another cloud of spray, but this time stuck to my purpose and set myself, with all my strength and caution, to paddle after the unsteered HISPANIOLA.Once I shipped a sea so heavy that I had to stop and bail, with my heart fluttering like a bird, but gradually I got into the way of the thing and guided my coracle among the waves, with only now and then a blow upon her bows and a dash of foam in my face."
"我飞速地向大船划去。我能看到黄铜舵柄晃动着闪闪发光，但甲板上还是一个人影也没有。我只能认为大船已被人丢弃了。如果不是那样，就是人已经醉倒在船舱里，这样，我就可以把他们锁在里面，船就归我随意处置了。","I was now gaining rapidly on the schooner; I could see the brass glisten on the tiller as it banged about, and still no soul appeared upon her decks.I could not choose but suppose she was deserted.If not, the men were lying drunk below, where I might batten them down, perhaps, and do what I chose with the ship."
"有一段时间大船干了件对我来说糟糕的事——静止不动。船头几乎正对着南方，偶尔有点偏差。每次偏离的时候，部分船帆就会重新鼓起，使她重新又对准风向。我刚才说这事对我来说糟糕透顶，是因为大船尽管看起来一动不动，但船帆却噼里啪啦地像放炮，滑车在甲板上砰砰地滚个不停，整个船离我越来越远。她跟着海浪前进，加上很大的风压，速度特别快。","For some time she had been doing the worse thing possible for me—standing still.She headed nearly due south, yawing, of course, all the time.Each time she fell off, her sails partly filled, and these brought her in a moment right to the wind again.I have said this was the worst thing possible for me, for helpless as she looked in this situation, with the canvas cracking like cannon and the blocks trundling and banging on the deck, she still continued to run away from me, not only with the speed of the current, but by the whole amount of her leeway, which was naturally great."
"但现在，我终于得到了机会。风速变慢了一小会儿，海浪使伊斯帕尼奥拉号围着自己的中心打转，终于让我看到了船尾。船舱的窗子还是开着的，桌上放的那盏灯也还点着。主帆像旗子一样耷拉着。要不是海浪带动，大船就会在原地不动。","But now, at last, I had my chance.The breeze fell for some seconds, very low, and the current gradually turning her, the HISPANIOLA revolved slowly round her centre and at last presented me her stern, with the cabin window still gaping open and the lamp over the table still burning on into the day.The main-sail hung drooped like a banner.She was stock-still but for the current."
"我刚才一直没办法，但现在开始加倍努力地追向她。","For the last little while I had even lost, but now redoubling my efforts, I began once more to overhaul the chase."
"我离她不到一百码时，风又吹了起来。左侧船帆鼓得满满的，大船又动了起来，就像燕子俯身掠过水面。","I was not a hundred yards from her when the wind came again in a clap; she filled on the port tack and was off again, stooping and skimming like a swallow."
"我先是觉得失望，紧接着又觉得欣喜。大船转了方向，舷侧靠近我，直到和我的小船距离渐渐接近到一半、三分之二、四分之三。我已经能看到波浪在大船龙骨前端下面翻腾。从我这个小船的低矮位置望去，大船显得无比高大。","My first impulse was one of despair, but my second was towards joy.Round she came, till she was broadside on to me—round still till she had covered a half and then two thirds and then three quarters of the distance that separated us.I could see the waves boiling white under her forefoot.Immensely tall she looked to me from my low station in the coracle."
"然后，我突然明白了。我还来不及想，也来不及采取措施自救。当大船越过一个浪头，我的小船正在另一个浪头的浪尖上。船头的斜桅杆在我头顶上方。我抬脚一跳，将小船踩进水里。我一手抓住三角帆，一只脚夹在支索和转帆索之间。就在我吊在那儿喘气时，一声闷响告诉我，大船自上而下撞沉了小船。我只能毫无退路地留在了伊斯帕尼奥拉号上。","And then, of a sudden, I began to comprehend.I had scarce time to think—scarce time to act and save myself.I was on the summit of one swell when the schooner came stooping over the next.The bowsprit was over my head.I sprang to my feet and leaped, stamping the coracle under water.With one hand I caught the jib-boom, while my foot was lodged between the stay and the brace; and as I still clung there panting, a dull blow told me that the schooner had charged down upon and struck the coracle and that I was left without retreat on the HISPANIOLA."
"第二十五章 我降下了骷髅旗","Chapter 25 I Strike the Jolly Roger "
"我还没在斜桅杆上稳住，就听见三角帆像大炮一样啪地一声鼓满了风，转向了另一边。大船转弯时连龙骨都在抖，但紧接着，虽然其它船帆还张着，船头的三角帆却哗啦垂下来不动了。","I had scarce gained a position on the bowsprit when the flying jib flapped and filled upon the other tack, with a report like a gun.The schooner trembled to her keel under the reverse, but next moment, the other sails still drawing, the jib flapped back again and hung idle."
"这一下差点把我甩进海里。我赶紧顺着斜桅杆往下爬，最后头朝下滚到了甲板上。","This had nearly tossed me off into the sea; and now I lost no time, crawled back along the bowsprit, and tumbled head foremost on the deck."
"我在水手舱背风的一侧，张开的主帆使我只能看到后甲板的一部分。船上一个人影也没有。甲板从发生叛乱以来就没擦洗过，上面留下了许多脚印，一个断颈的空瓶在排水孔之间滚来滚去，倒像是个活的东西。","I was on the lee side of the forecastle, and the mainsail, which was still drawing, concealed from me a certain portion of the after-deck.Not a soul was to be seen.The planks, which had not been swabbed since the mutiny, bore the print of many feet, and an empty bottle, broken by the neck, tumbled to and fro like a live thing in the scuppers."
"突然，伊斯帕尼奥拉号又正对风口了。我身后的三角帆发出噼啪的响声，船舵也乒乓作响。整个船身来回起伏，令人恶心。就在这时，主帆杠向船的内侧一转，滑车上的帆索发出声响，下风处的后甲板显露在我眼前。","Suddenly the HISPANIOLA came right into the wind.The jibs behind me cracked aloud, the rudder slammed to, the whole ship gave a sickening heave and shudder, and at the same moment the main-boom swung inboard, the sheet groaning in the blocks, and showed me the lee after-deck."
"那里有两个海盗。戴红帽的那个四脚朝天地躺在那儿，就像船上的绞盘棒一样动也不动。他紧咬双唇，伸着胳膊，像被钉在了十字架上。伊斯雷尔·汉兹靠着舷墙坐着，下巴低在胸上，双手掌心朝上摊在面前的甲板上，棕黑的面孔苍白得像牛油烛一样。","There were the two watchmen, sure enough: red-cap on his back, as stiff as a handspike, with his arms stretched out like those of a crucifix and his teeth showing through his open lips; Israel Hands propped against the bulwarks, his chin on his chest, his hands lying open before him on the deck, his face as white, under its tan, as a tallow candle."
"有那么一会儿，大船像烈马一样上蹿下跳，左摇右晃；鼓起的风帆时而这边受风，时而那边受风。帆杠来回晃动，扯得主桅杆吱吱作响。阵阵浪花时不时地飞过舷墙，船头狠狠撞击着海浪。总之，这艘装备精良的大帆船竟然比不过我那只手工制作、老是跑偏、已经沉入海底的小船。","For a while the ship kept bucking and sidling like a vicious horse, the sails filling, now on one tack, now on another, and the boom swinging to and fro till the mast groaned aloud under the strain.Now and again too there would come a cloud of light sprays over the bulwark and a heavy blow of the ship’s bows against the swell; so much heavier weather was made of it by this great rigged ship than by my home-made, lop-sided coracle, now gone to the bottom of the sea."
"大船一动，戴红帽的那个家伙就跟着来回摇晃，但无论船怎么晃，他的姿势和龇牙咧嘴的笑一点儿也没变，让人看了害怕。同样，船一晃动，汉兹似乎更加蜷缩，双脚向外伸得更远些，整个身体也越来越向船尾倾斜。那张脸一点点移出了我的视线。最后，我只能看到他的一只耳朵和一缕络腮胡子。","At every jump of the schooner, red-cap slipped to and fro, but—what was ghastly to behold—neither his attitude nor his fixed teeth—disclosing grin was anyway disturbed by this rough usage.At every jump too, Hands appeared still more to sink into himself and settle down upon the deck, his feet sliding ever the farther out, and the whole body canting towards the stern, so that his face became, little by little, hid from me; and at last I could see nothing beyond his ear and the frayed ringlet of one whisker."
"同时，我还发现他俩周围的甲板上都有暗黑色血迹。我开始相信他们一定是酒醉后愤怒时杀了对方。","At the same time, I observed, around both of them, splashes of dark blood upon the planks and began to feel sure that they had killed each other in their drunken wrath."
"我正看着想着，船这时又不动了。伊斯雷尔·汉兹侧了侧身，低声呻吟了一下，扭了下身子，然后又恢复了我一开始看到他时的姿势。呻吟声说明他很痛苦，身体极度虚弱。他张着嘴、下巴低垂，让我不禁怜悯起他来。但一想起我在苹果桶里偷听到他说的那些话，所有的怜悯又消失了。","While I was thus looking and wondering, in a calm moment, when the ship was still, Israel Hands turned partly round and with a low moan writhed himself back to the position in which I had seen him first.The moan, which told of pain and deadly weakness, and the way in which his jaw hung open went right to my heart.But when I remembered the talk I had overheard from the apple barrel, all pity left me."
"我朝船尾走去，一直走到主桅杆前。","I walked aft until I reached the main-mast."
"“我上船来了，汉兹先生。”我挖苦地说道。","“Come aboard, Mr. Hands,” I said ironically."
"他吃力地转了转眼珠，虚弱得连惊讶都表现不出来了。他只说了一个词：“白兰地。”","He rolled his eyes round heavily, but he was too far gone to express surprise.All he could do was to utter one word, “Brandy.”"
"我知道没时间可以浪费，就避开又扫到甲板的桅杆，溜到船尾，走下升降口的楼梯进了船舱。","It occurred to me there was no time to lose, and dodging the boom as it once more lurched across the deck, I slipped aft and down the companion stairs into the cabin."
"船舱里一片混乱，简直难以想象。为了找到那张地图，所有上锁的地方都被撬开了。地板上都是厚厚的泥沙，大概是那群海盗从营地旁的沼泽地过来后，坐在这里喝酒或商量事儿留下的。　原先雪白、镶金珠的船舱壁现在留下了许多脏手印。角落里几十个空酒瓶堆在一起，随着大船的摇晃来回滚动。桌上放着一本打开的医书，一半已经撕掉了，我觉得是卷烟了。在这些东西中间，那盏油灯仍在冒着烟，发出暗暗的咖啡色的光。","It was such a scene of confusion as you can hardly fancy.All the lockfast places had been broken open in quest of the chart.The floor was thick with mud where ruffians had sat down to drink or consult after wading in the marshes round their camp.The bulkheads, all painted in clear white and beaded round with gilt, bore a pattern of dirty hands.Dozens of empty bottles clinked together in corners to the rolling of the ship.One of the doctor’s medical books lay open on the table, half of the leaves gutted out, I suppose, for pipelights.In the midst of all this the lamp still cast a smoky glow, obscure and brown as umber."
"我走进酒窖，发现所有的酒桶都空了。喝完乱扔的酒瓶多得让人吃惊。显然，从内乱开始以来，他们中没有一个人能保持头脑清醒。","I went into the cellar; all the barrels were gone, and of the bottles a most surprising number had been drunk out and thrown away.Certainly, since the mutiny began, not a man of them could ever have been sober."
"我找了半天，才发现有个瓶里还剩些白兰地，可以给汉兹。我为自己找了些干面包、一点儿水果干、一大把葡萄干和一块奶酪。我带着这些东西回到甲板，放在舵柄后面汉兹够不着的地方，然后走到淡水桶前，喝了个痛快。然后，我才把白兰地递给汉兹。","Foraging about, I found a bottle with some brandy left, for Hands; and for myself I routed out some biscuit, some pickled fruits, a great bunch of raisins, and a piece of cheese.With these I came on deck, put down my own stock behind the rudder head and well out of the coxswain’s reach, went forward to the water-breaker, and had a good deep drink of water, and then, and not till then, gave Hands the brandy."
"他至少喝了四分之一品脱才把酒瓶放下。　","He must have drunk a gill before he took the bottle from his mouth."
"他说道：“唉！妈的！我早就想喝几口！”","“Aye,” said he, “by thunder, but I wanted some o’ that!”"
"我已经开始坐在角落里吃东西了。","I had sat down already in my own corner and begun to eat."
"“伤得很重吗？”我问他。","“Much hurt?” I asked him."
"他咕哝了一声，或者说更像是嚎叫。","He grunted, or rather, I might say, he barked."
"他说：“要是医生在船上，我不久就能好了。可是你瞧，我没那个运气，现在成了这个样子。那个杂种已经死了。”他指着那个戴着红睡帽的家伙又说，“他怎么也不像水手。你是从哪儿来的？”","“If that doctor was aboard,” he said, “I’d be right enough in a couple of turns, but I don’t have no manner of luck, you see, and that’s what’s the matter with me.As for that swab, he’s good and dead, he is,”he added, indicating the man with the red cap.“He warn’t no seaman anyhow.And where mought you have come from?”"
"我说：“哦，我是来接管这艘大船的，汉兹先生。没有接到进一步指示之前，你可以把我当作船长。”","“Well,” said I, “I’ve come aboard to take possession of this ship, Mr. Hands; and you’ll please regard me as your captain until further notice.”"
"他愠怒地看了我一眼，但没说什么。他脸上恢复了些血色，但看起来还是很虚弱。当船晃动的时候，他的身体还是往下滑。","He looked at me sourly enough but said nothing.Some of the colour had come back into his cheeks, though he still looked very sick and still continued to slip out and settle down as the ship banged about."
"我接着说：“对了，我不要这种旗。汉兹先生，对不起，我得把它降下来。宁可不挂，也不要这个。”","“By the by,” I continued, “I can’t have these colours, Mr. Hands; and by your leave, I’ll strike ‘em.Better none than these.”"
"我再次避开帆杠，跑到旗杆前，降下那可恶的黑色海盗旗，扔出船外。","And again dodging the boom, I ran to the colour lines, handed down their cursed black flag, and chucked it overboard."
"“上帝保佑我王！”我挥着帽子喊道，“让西尔弗船长去死吧！”","“God save the king!” said I, waving my cap.“And there’s an end to Captain Silver!”"
"他的下巴一直垂在胸前，眼睛却始终狡猾地看着我。","He watched me keenly and slyly, his chin all the while on his breast."
"他最后说：“我想，霍金斯船长，你是想到岸上去吧。咱们可以好好谈谈。”","“I reckon,” he said at last, “I reckon, Cap’n Hawkins, you’ll kind of want to get ashore now.S’pose we talks.”"
"我回答道：“好啊，汉兹先生，我全心全意听着。你继续说。”","“Why, yes,” said I, “with all my heart, Mr. Hands.Say on.”"
"我回去继续吃东西，胃口很好。","And I went back to my meal with a good appetite."
"他无力地朝着尸体点点头说道：“这家伙叫奥布赖恩，是个爱尔兰佬。我们当时扯起风帆，想把船驶回去。现在他死了，臭得跟船底的脏水似的，我不知道还有谁可以驾驶这个船。要是没我指点你，我告诉你，你绝对不行。现在，听我说，你供我吃喝，再拿个旧围巾或手绢帮我把伤口包起来，我就告诉你怎么驾船。我认为这样对你我都公平。","“This man,” he began, nodding feebly at the corpse “—O’Brien were his name, a rank Irelander—this man and me got the canvas on her, meaning for to sail her back.Well, HE’S dead now, he is—as dead as bilge; and who’s to sail this ship, I don’t see.Without I gives you a hint, you ain’t that man, as far’s I can tell.Now, look here, you gives me food and drink and a old scarf or ankecher to tie my wound up, you do, and I’ll tell you how to sail her, and that’s about square all round, I take it.”"
"我说：“我要告诉你一件事，我不回基德船长的锚地去。我打算将船驶到北汊，让船平稳靠岸。","“I’ll tell you one thing,” said I: “I’m not going back to Captain Kidd’s anchorage.I mean to get into North Inlet and beach her quietly there.”"
"他喊道：“你真了不起！但我也不是个笨蛋啊！难道我不明白吗？我试过自己的运气，输得很惨，你赢了我。把船开进北汊？好，反正我也没得选择。就是你让我把船开到正法码头也行，见鬼！我也会去的。”","“To be sure you did,” he cried.“Why, I ain’t sich an infernal lubber after all.I can see, can’t I?I’ve tried my fling, I have, and I’ve lost, and it’s you has the wind of me.North Inlet?Why, I haven’t no ch’ice, not I!I’d help you sail her up to Execution Dock, by thunder!So I would.”"
"我觉得他的话有点道理。我们的交易当场达成。三分钟后，我们开着伊斯帕尼奥拉号沿着金银岛的西海岸顺风行驶，很有希望在中午之前绕过北角，在涨潮之前开进北汊。然后我们可以把船安全靠岸，再等退潮后上岸。","Well, as it seemed to me, there was some sense in this.We struck our bargain on the spot.In three minutes I had the HISPANIOLA sailing easily before the wind along the coast of Treasure Island, with good hopes of turning the northern point ere noon and beating down again as far as North Inlet before high water, when we might beach her safely and wait till the subsiding tide permitted us to land."
"于是，我绑住舵柄，走进船舱，从箱子里拿出妈妈给我的柔软的丝绸手绢。在我的帮助下，汉兹用手绢把大腿上滴血的伤口包扎好，那个伤口是弯刀刺的。然后，他吃了点儿东西又喝了两三口白兰地。他明显精神了些，能坐直了些，声音大了，也清楚多了，跟刚才简直不是同一个人。","Then I lashed the tiller and went below to my own chest, where I got a soft silk handkerchief of my mother’s.With this, and with my aid, Hands bound up the great bleeding stab he had received in the thigh, and after he had eaten a little and had a swallow or two more of the brandy, he began to pick up visibly, sat straighter up, spoke louder and clearer, and looked in every way another man."
"风也在竭力为我们服务。船像鸟一样乘风掠过水面，小岛的两岸一闪而过，景色一直在变。不一会儿我们就过了高地，然后又经过了低低的沙地，上面零星点缀着几棵矮松。不久，我们将这些抛在了身后，绕过岛上最北端的石头小山。","The breeze served us admirably.We skimmed before it like a bird, the coast of the island flashing by and the view changing every minute.Soon we were past the high lands and bowling beside low, sandy country, sparsely dotted with dwarf pines, and soon we were beyond that again and had turned the corner of the rocky hill that ends the island on the north."
"我为拥有这个新指挥权而得意洋洋，也因灿烂的阳光，变换的风景而欣喜。我现在淡水和食物都很丰富，一想到自己达成这样的功绩，对当初自己擅自离开的内疚感也就淡了。我想我本应该毫无所求了，但是汉兹的眼睛一直不怀好意地盯着我在甲板上的动静，脸上也一直是那种古怪的笑容。这是老人憔悴的微笑，显出某种程度的痛苦和衰弱。不仅如此，他看着我忙时，脸上还带着讥讽的表情和奸诈的阴影，而且一直看着我。","I was greatly elated with my new command, and pleased with the bright, sunshiny weather and these different prospects of the coast.I had now plenty of water and good things to eat, and my conscience, which had smitten me hard for my desertion, was quieted by the great conquest I had made.I should, I think, have had nothing left me to desire but for the eyes of the coxswain as they followed me derisively about the deck and the odd smile that appeared continually on his face.It was a smile that had in it something both of pain and weakness—a haggard old man’s smile; but there was, besides that, a grain of derision, a shadow of treachery, in his expression as he craftily watched, and watched, and watched me at my work."
"第二十六章 伊斯雷尔·汉兹","Chapter 26 Israel Hands  "
"风正合我们的意，现在转成了西风。我们可以很容易从岛的东北角航行到北汊的入口处。只是，我们没有力气把船停靠在岸边，想等潮水涨得再高些，再将船靠岸。时间过得好慢啊！汉兹教我怎么靠岸，试了好多次我才成功。然后我们静静地坐下又吃了一顿。","The wind, serving us to a desire, now hauled into the west.We could run so much the easier from the north-east corner of the island to the mouth of the North Inlet.Only, as we had no power to anchor and dared not beach her till the tide had flowed a good deal farther, time hung on our hands.The coxswain told me how to lay the ship to; after a good many trials I succeeded, and we both sat in silence over another meal."
"“船长，”他终于开口，脸上还是挂着那种不舒服的笑容，“我那老伙计奥布赖恩躺在那儿，你还是把他扔到船外吧。我不怎么在乎规矩，杀掉他也不会自责，只是不想让他躺在这儿当摆设，你说呢？”","“Cap’n,” said he at length with that same uncomfortable smile, “here’s my old shipmate, O’Brien; s’pose you was to heave him overboard.I ain’t partic’lar as a rule, and I don’t take no blame for settling his hash, but I don’t reckon him ornamental now, do you?”"
"我说：“我没那个力气。我也不想干。我看就让他在那躺着吧。”","“I’m not strong enough, and I don’t like the job; and there he lies, for me,” said I."
"“吉姆，伊斯帕尼奥拉号是条不吉利的船。”他眨眨眼继续说道。“这条船杀气重——自从我们从布里斯托尔出海以来，船上送命的倒霉水手好多呢。我还从来没见过这么倒霉的，从没见过！就说这个奥布赖恩吧，现在不也送命了吗？嗯，我这人没文化，你是能读会算的孩子，直接告诉我，一个人死了就死了，还是能转世再活过来？”","“This here’s an unlucky ship, this HISPANIOLA, Jim,” he went on, blinking.“There’s a power of men been killed in this HISPANIOLA—a sight o’ poor seamen dead and gone since you and me took ship to Bristol.I never seen sich dirty luck, not I.There was this here O’Brien now—he’s dead, ain’t he?Well now, I’m no scholar, and you’re a lad as can read and figure, and to put it straight, do you take it as a dead man is dead for good, or do he come alive again?”"
"我答道：“汉兹先生，你应该早就知道，你能杀死一个人的肉体，但是杀不死他的灵魂。奥布赖恩到了另一个世界，也许在看着我们呢。”","“You can kill the body, Mr. Hands, but not the spirit; you must know that already,” I replied.“O’Brien there is in another world, and may be watching us.”"
"他说：“啊！那可真不幸——看样子杀人就是在浪费时间。然而，我却觉得灵魂也没什么。吉姆，我迟早总会和灵魂碰面的。现在，话都说成这样了，如果你能去船舱里帮我拿——见鬼！我叫不上名字了——对了，给我拿瓶葡萄酒吧。吉姆，这白兰地太烈，我脑袋受不了。”","“Ah!” said he.“Well, that’s unfort’nate—appears as if killing parties was a waste of time.Howsomever, sperrits don’t reckon for much, by what I’ve seen.I’ll chance it with the sperrits, Jim.And now, you’ve spoke up free, and I’ll take it kind if you’d step down into that there cabin and get me a well, a shiver my timbers!I can’t hit the name on ‘t; well, you get me a bottle of wine, Jim—this here brandy’s too strong for my head.”"
"汉兹犹犹豫豫的样子似乎不太自然，而且他宁可要喝葡萄酒也不要白兰地，我完全不信。这一切只是个借口。很明显，他想让我离开甲板，但是我想不出他有什么目的。他总是避开我的目光，四处张望，上下乱看；一会看看天，一会瞥一眼死去的奥布赖恩。他始终笑着，伸出舌头装出抱歉或不好意思的样子，连小孩子也能看出这家伙不怀好意。然而，我立刻就答应了，我知道自己的优势在哪儿。和这么愚蠢的家伙在一起，我很容易让他始终看不出我的怀疑之心。","Now, the coxswain’s hesitation seemed to be unnatural, and as for the notion of his preferring wine to brandy, I entirely disbelieved it.The whole story was a pretext.He wanted me to leave the deck—so much was plain; but with what purpose I could in no way imagine.His eyes never met mine; they kept wandering to and fro, up and down, now with a look to the sky, now with a flitting glance upon the dead O’Brien.All the time he kept smiling and putting his tongue out in the most guilty, embarrassed manner, so that a child could have told that he was bent on some deception.I was prompt with my answer, however, for I saw where my advantage lay and that with a fellow so densely stupid I could easily conceal my suspicions to the end."
"我说：“葡萄酒吗？很好。红的还是白的？”","“Some wine?” I said.“Far better.Will you have white or red?”"
"他答道：“哎，哪种对我来说都一样。只要够烈够多就行，其它的有什么关系呢？”","“Well, I reckon it’s about the blessed same to me, shipmate,”  he replied; “so it’s strong, and plenty of it, what’s the odds?”"
"我回答道：“好。我给你拿去，汉兹先生。但是我得找一会儿。”","“All right,” I answered.“I’ll bring you port, Mr. Hands.But I’ll have to dig for it.”"
"我说着就从扶梯那儿跑了下去，尽量弄出很大的声响。然后，我脱下鞋，静静地跑过圆木通道，爬上水手舱的梯子，把头探出扶梯。虽然我知道他绝对想不到我会在那儿，但我还是极其小心，结果我所怀疑的最糟糕的事被证实了。","With that I scuttled down the companion with all the noise I could, slipped off my shoes, ran quietly along the sparred gallery, mounted the forecastle ladder, and popped my head out of the fore companion.I knew he would not expect to see me there, yet I took every precaution possible, and certainly the worst of my suspicions proved too true."
"他手脚并用着爬离了原来的地方。很明显，当他移动的时候，有条腿上的伤痛很疼——因为我听到他压抑着的呻吟声——然而他还是拖着身子迅速爬过甲板。不到半分钟的工夫，他就已经爬到左舷的排水孔那里，从一堆绳子下面摸出把长刀，或者说是把短剑，一直到刀柄那儿都是血迹。他抬着下巴看了会儿刀子，用手试了试刀尖，就立刻将它藏在怀里，然后重新爬回舷墙旁的老地方。","He had risen from his position to his hands and knees, and though his leg obviously hurt him pretty sharply when he moved—for I could hear him stifle a groan—yet it was at a good, rattling rate that he trailed himself across the deck.In half a minute he had reached the port scuppers and picked, out of a coil of rope, a long knife, or rather a short dirk, discoloured to the hilt with blood.He looked upon it for a moment, thrusting forth his under jaw, tried the point upon his hand, and then, hastily concealing it in the bosom of his jacket, trundled back again into his old place against the bulwark."
"这就是我想知道的。伊斯雷尔能够爬行，现在他又有了武器。他刚才那么想方设法地摆脱我，很显然是想干掉我。接下来他想干什么呢？是从北汊穿过海岛爬回到沼泽地中的营地呢，还是想开炮，指望同党来救他呢？这个我可说不好。","This was all that I required to know.Israel could move about, he was now armed, and if he had been at so much trouble to get rid of me, it was plain that I was meant to be the victim.What he would do afterwards—whether he would try to crawl right across the island from North Inlet to the camp among the swamps or whether he would fire Long Tom, trusting that his own comrades might come first to help him—was, of course, more than I could say."
"但是有一点我能相信他——如何驾驭这艘大船，在这点上，我们俩利益一致。我俩都希望能把她安全停泊在一个隐蔽的地方，那样的话，时机一到我们才能不费多大力气，安全地重新出海。我估计在这之前，我没什么生命危险。","Yet I felt sure that I could trust him in one point, since in that our interests jumped together, and that was in the disposition of the schooner.We both desired to have her stranded safe enough, in a sheltered place, and so that, when the time came, she could be got off again with as little labour and danger as might be; and until that was done I considered that my life would certainly be spared."
"我想这些的时候身体也并没闲着。我偷偷溜回船舱，重新穿上鞋子，随手拿瓶葡萄酒去交差，然后又回到了甲板上。","While I was thus turning the business over in my mind, I had not been idle with my body.I had stolen back to the cabin, slipped once more into my shoes, and laid my hand at random on a bottle of wine, and now, with this for an excuse, I made my reappearance on the deck."
"汉兹仍像我离开时那样躺着，身子缩成一团，眼皮下垂，好像虚弱得连阳光都受不了。然而，他还是抬起头看着我走过来，接过酒瓶，熟练地敲断瓶颈，狠狠喝了一大口，照旧说了一句“好运！”","Hands lay as I had left him, all fallen together in a bundle and with his eyelids lowered as though he were too weak to bear the light.He looked up, however, at my coming, knocked the neck off the bottle like a man who had done the same thing often, and took a good swig, with his favourite toast of “Here’s luck!”"
"接着，他静静地躺了一会，然后掏出一条烟叶，求我帮他切一块。","Then he lay quiet for a little, and then, pulling out a stick of tobacco, begged me to cut him a quid."
"他说：“给我切一块吧。我没刀子，即使有刀也没力气。吉姆啊，吉姆，我想我真的完了！给我切一块，这也许是最后一口烟了。伙计呀，我就要回老家了，真的。”","“Cut me a junk o’ that,” said he, “for I haven’t no knife and hardly strength enough, so be as I had.Ah, Jim, Jim, I reckon I’ve missed stays!Cut me a quid, as’ll likely be the last, lad, for I’m for my long home, and no mistake.”"
"我说：“行，给你切一块。不过，如果我是你，感觉自己不行了，我会像个基督徒一样祷告。”","“Well,” said I, “I’ll cut you some tobacco, but if I was you and thought myself so badly, I would go to my prayers like a Christian man.”"
"他问道：“为什么？告诉我为什么？”","“Why?” said he.“Now, you tell me why.”"
"我大喊道：“为什么？你刚才还问我人死了会怎样。你违背了你的信仰，生活在罪恶、谎言和血腥中。你杀死的那个人现在还躺在你的脚下，你还问我为什么！求上帝宽恕你吧，汉兹先生，这就是原因。”","“Why?” I cried.“You were asking me just now about the dead.You’ve broken your trust; you’ve lived in sin and lies and blood; there’s a man you killed lying at your feet this moment, and you ask me why!For God’s mercy, Mr. Hands, that’s why.”"
"我想到他兜里藏着带血的短剑，还想设计我，如此邪恶，说话时就有些激动。而他也猛喝了一大口酒，用异常庄重的口气回答我。","I spoke with a little heat, thinking of the bloody dirk he had hidden in his pocket and designed, in his ill thoughts, to end me with.He, for his part, took a great draught of the wine and spoke with the most unusual solemnity."
"他说道：“三十年了！我一直在海上漂，好的、坏的、稍好的、稍差的、好天气、坏天气、断粮食、动刀子，什么没见过！好吧，我告诉你，我就从没见过好人有好报。我就喜欢先下手为强，反正死人不会咬人。这就是我的想法——阿门，就这样吧。现在，看看这儿吧。”他忽然变了声调，接着说，“我们说太多废话了。现在潮水涨得够高了。霍金斯船长，你只要听我命令，我们就能将船驶进去，干好这事。”","“For thirty years,” he said, “I’ve sailed the seas and seen good and bad, better and worse, fair weather and foul, provisions running out, knives going, and what not.Well, now I tell you, I never seen good come o’ goodness yet.Him as strikes first is my fancy; dead men don’t bite; them’s my views—amen, so be it.And now, you look here,” he added, suddenly changing his tone, “we’ve had about enough of this foolery.The tide’s made good enough by now.You just take my orders, Cap’n Hawkins, and we’ll sail slap in and be done with it.”"
"我们总航程不到两英里，但航行却非常困难。北锚地的入口处不仅又窄又浅，还东拐西拐的，因此必须技术很好才能把大船开进去。我认为自己很能干，是个好副手，我也确信汉兹是优秀的领航员。我们拐来拐去，东躲西闪，擦着浅滩前行，船又平又稳，看起来很好。","All told, we had scarce two miles to run; but the navigation was delicate, the entrance to this northern anchorage was not only narrow and shoal, but lay east and west, so that the schooner must be nicely handled to be got in.I think I was a good, prompt subaltern, and I am very sure that Hands was an excellent pilot, for we went about and about and dodged in, shaving the banks, with a certainty and a neatness that were a pleasure to behold."
"我们刚过海角就被陆地包围了。北汊的岸上也跟南锚地沿岸一样，长着茂密的树林，但这里水域更长更窄一些，更像是河流的入海口，实际也是如此。我们看到，在我们正前方的南端有一艘船的残骸，破落得看不出样子。那是一艘很大的三桅帆船，但长期风吹日晒的，上面挂满了湿漉漉的海藻，岸上的灌木也在甲板上生根，开着鲜艳的花朵。看起来一片凄凉，但这说明锚地是平静的。","Scarcely had we passed the heads before the land closed around us.The shores of North Inlet were as thickly wooded as those of the southern anchorage, but the space was longer and narrower and more like, what in truth it was, the estuary of a river.Right before us, at the southern end, we saw the wreck of a ship in the last stages of dilapidation.It had been a great vessel of three masts but had lain so long exposed to the injuries of the weather that it was hung about with great webs of dripping seaweed, and on the deck of it shore bushes had taken root and now flourished thick with flowers.It was a sad sight, but it showed us that the anchorage was calm."
"汉兹说：“你瞧那儿，那儿是冲上岸的最佳点。那里沙滩平，没风，四周全是树，破船上的鲜花开得像个花园一样。”","“Now,” said Hands, “look there; there’s a pet bit for to beach a ship in.Fine flat sand, never a cat’s paw, trees all around of it, and flowers a blowing like a garding on that old ship.”"
"我问：“但是一旦靠了岸，我们怎么才能让船重新航行呢？”","“And once beached,” I inquired, “how shall we get her off again?”"
"他答道：“这个呀？退潮的时候，你拉着绳子到对岸，把绳子绕在一棵大松树上，再拉回来绕在绞盘上，然后躺下来等涨潮。等涨潮了，一起拉绳子，船自然就会动了。现在，孩子呀，看好了。咱们现在靠近沙滩了，船速有点儿太快了。稍微向右点——对——稳住——再向右——向左一点——稳住——稳住！”","“Why, so,” he replied: “you take a line ashore there on the other side at low water, take a turn about one of them big pines; bring it back, take a turn around the capstan, and lie to for the tide.Come high water, all hands take a pull upon the line, and off she comes as sweet as natur’.And now, boy, you stand by.We’re near the bit now, and she’s too much way on her.Starboard a little—so—steady—starboard—larboard a little—steady—steady!”"
"他就这样发号施令，而我则屏气凝神地执行着，直到他突然大喊一声：“现在，伙计，转舵向风！”","So he issued his commands, which I breathlessly obeyed, till, all of a sudden, he cried, “Now, my hearty, luff!”"
"我使劲转动舵柄，伊斯帕尼奥拉号来了个急转弯，冲上了长着矮树的浅滩。","And I put the helm hard up, and the HISPANIOLA swung round rapidly and ran stem on for the low, wooded shore."
"刚才一连串的操作所带来的兴奋劲儿多少分散了我的戒心。我在这之前一直密切注意着汉兹的举动。我全神贯注地等着船靠向沙滩，竟然忘了近在眼前的危险，还伸长脖子探出右舷墙，看着船头下面散开的波纹。要不是突如其来的不安抓住了我，使我转过头，我也许还来不及挣扎就一命呜呼了。也许是我听到了嘎吱嘎吱的声音，也许是我眼角看到他的影子在动，也许是一种像猫一样的本能，总之，当我转过头来，发现汉兹右手握着短剑已经快到我跟前了。","The excitement of these last manoeuvres had somewhat interfered with the watch I had kept hitherto, sharply enough, upon the coxswain.Even then I was still so much interested, waiting for the ship to touch, that I had quite forgot the peril that hung over my head and stood craning over the starboard bulwarks and watching the ripples spreading wide before the bows.I might have fallen without a struggle for my life had not a sudden disquietude seized upon me and made me turn my head.Perhaps I had heard a creak or seen his shadow moving with the tail of my eye; perhaps it was an instinct like a cat’s; but, sure enough, when I looked round, there was Hands, already half way towards me, with the dirk in his right hand."
"我们眼光相遇时肯定都大叫了一声。如果说我发出的是恐惧的尖叫，他的就像公牛进攻时的那种吼叫。他立刻扑了过来，我朝船头那边闪过去。我闪开时松开了舵柄，舵柄顺着风旋转才救了我的命。因为弹开的舵柄正打中汉兹的胸部，阻止了他，使他一时无法动弹。","We must both have cried out aloud when our eyes met, but while mine was the shrill cry of terror, his was a roar of fury like a charging bully’s.At the same instant, he threw himself forward and I leapt sideways towards the bows.As I did so, I let go of the tiller, which sprang sharp to leeward, and I think this saved my life, for it struck Hands across the chest and stopped him, for the moment, dead."
"还没等他恢复过来，我就安全地逃出被他逼进去的角落，可以在整个甲板上逃开他。我停在了主桅杆前，从口袋里掏出手枪，尽管这时他已经转过身来又向我扑来，我还是冷静地瞄准目标，然后扣动扳机。撞针落了下来，但是既没有火光也没有声音，原来火药被海水打湿了。我骂自己太大意。为什么我没有早点儿将这仅有的武器重新装上子弹呢？要是这样，我也不会像现在这样成了待宰的羔羊呀。","Before he could recover, I was safe out of the corner where he had me trapped, with all the deck to dodge about.Just forward of the main-mast I stopped, drew a pistol from my pocket, took a cool aim, though he had already turned and was once more coming directly after me, and drew the trigger.The hammer fell, but there followed neither flash nor sound; the priming was useless with sea-water.I cursed myself for my neglect.Why had not I, long before, reprimed and reloaded my only weapons?Then I should not have been as now, a mere fleeing sheep before this butcher."
"他虽然受了伤，动作却快得惊人，斑白的头发披散着，脸也因气急败坏而涨得通红。我没时间再试另外一支枪，实际上也不想试，我敢保证那支也不能用。有一点我很清楚：我不能只是往后退，那样他很快就会把我逼到船头，就像刚才他差点把我堵进船尾。一旦这样被抓，他那把九英寸或十英寸长的血剑，将是我在人间尝的最后一种滋味。我双手抱着相当粗的主桅杆等着，每根神经都绷得紧紧的。","Wounded as he was, it was wonderful how fast he could move, his grizzled hair tumbling over his face, and his face itself as red as a red ensign with his haste and fury.I had no time to try my other pistol, nor indeed much inclination, for I was sure it would be useless.One thing I saw plainly: I must not simply retreat before him, or he would speedily hold me boxed into the bows, as a moment since he had so nearly boxed me in the stern.Once so caught, and nine or ten inches of the blood-stained dirk would be my last experience on this side of eternity.I placed my palms against the main-mast, which was of a goodish bigness, and waited, every nerve upon the stretch."
"他看出我在躲就停了下来。他佯攻了一两次，我也相应地躲了两下。这有点儿像我在老家黑山湾的岩石间玩的游戏，但你可以肯定，我的心从没跳得像现在这么厉害。就像我说的，这是小孩子的游戏。我想我不会输给一个腿上有伤的老年水手。说实在的，我的勇气开始高涨，甚至有时间考虑这事儿会怎么结束。我相信自己能耗上一段时间，但看不出有什么希望可以最终逃生。","Seeing that I meant to dodge, he also paused; and a moment or two passed in feints on his part and corresponding movements upon mine.It was such a game as I had often played at home about the rocks of Black Hill Cove, but never before, you may be sure, with such a wildly beating heart as now.Still, as I say, it was a boy’s game, and I thought I could hold my own at it against an elderly seaman with a wounded thigh.Indeed my courage had begun to rise so high that I allowed myself a few darting thoughts on what would be the end of the affair, and while I saw certainly that I could spin it out for long, I saw no hope of any ultimate escape."
"就在这时，大船突然一震，摇摇晃晃猛地冲向沙地，紧接着船身急速地向左船舷倾斜成与甲板成四十五度角竖了起来。大约有一大桶水喷溅着进了排水孔，在甲板和舷墙之间形成了个水塘。","Well, while things stood thus, suddenly the HISPANIOLA struck, staggered, ground for an instant in the sand, and then, swift as a blow, canted over to the port side till the deck stood at an angle of forty-five degrees and about a puncheon of water splashed into the scupper holes and lay, in a pool, between the deck and bulwark."
"我们俩立刻就都失去了平衡，两人扭在一起滚向排水孔。戴红睡帽那家伙的尸体还伸着手臂直挺挺地跟着我们滚下来。我们离得特别近，以至于我的头撞上了他的脚，砰的一声，磕得我牙咯咯作响。尽管撞了一下，我还是第一个站起来的，因为汉兹和尸体缠在了一起。船的突然倾斜使甲板上无处可逃，我必须找到新方法逃生，而且要快，因为敌人就要扑到我跟前了。想到这，我迅速跳上了后桅支索，双手交替着往上爬，直到爬到桅顶横桁上坐下来，才松了口气。","We were both of us capsized in a second, and both of us rolled, almost together, into the scuppers, the dead red-cap, with his arms still spread out, tumbling stiffly after us.So near were we, indeed, that my head came against the coxswain’s foot with a crack that made my teeth rattle.Blow and all, I was the first afoot again, for Hands had got involved with the dead body.The sudden canting of the ship had made the deck no place for running on; I had to find some new way of escape, and that upon the instant, for my foe was almost touching me.Quick as thought, I sprang into the mizzen shrouds, rattled up hand over hand, and did not draw a breath till I was seated on the cross-trees."
"幸亏我动作快才保住了性命。我向上爬的时候，短剑在我下面不到半英尺的地方刺了个空。汉兹站在那儿张着嘴，抬头望着我，一副吃惊又失望的样子。","I had been saved by being prompt; the dirk had struck not half a foot below me as I pursued my upward flight; and there stood Israel Hands with his mouth open and his face upturned to mine, a perfect statue of surprise and disappointment."
"我现在有时间，赶紧给手枪换了弹药。换好一支后，为了保险，又把另一支也重新装上了弹药。","Now that I had a moment to myself, I lost no time in changing the priming of my pistol, and then, having one ready for service, and to make assurance doubly sure, I proceeded to draw the load of the other and recharge it afresh from the beginning."
"我这个做法让汉兹惊呆了，他开始意识到处境对他很不利。他明显犹豫了一下，竟然拖着沉重的身体，拽着横桅索，嘴上刁着短剑，忍痛开始慢慢往上爬。他拖着受伤的大腿往上爬速度非常慢，而且异常痛苦。我在他刚刚爬过三分之一的路程时，就重新装好了两支枪。我一手拿一支枪，开始朝他喊话。","My new employment struck Hands all of a heap; he began to see the dice going against him, and after an obvious hesitation, he also hauled himself heavily into the shrouds, and with the dirk in his teeth, began slowly and painfully to mount.It cost him no end of time and groans to haul his wounded leg behind him, and I had quietly finished my arrangements before he was much more than a third of the way up.Then, with a pistol in either hand, I addressed him."
"我说：“汉兹先生，你要是敢再爬一步，我就打烂你的脑袋！你说过，死人是不咬人的。”我笑着又补充道。","“One more step, Mr. Hands,” said I, “and I’ll blow your brains out!Dead men don’t bite, you know,” I added with a chuckle."
"他立刻停了下来。从他脸上的表情我可以看出他正在全力思考。他想得又慢又费力，我仗着自己在安全的地方，就大笑起来。最后，他咽了咽口水开始说话，脸上还是挂着那种极度茫然的表情。为了说话，他只好拿下嘴里的刀，但仍保持浑身不动。","He stopped instantly.I could see by the working of his face that he was trying to think, and the process was so slow and laborious that, in my new-found security, I laughed aloud.At last, with a swallow or two, he spoke, his face still wearing the same expression of extreme perplexity.In order to speak he had to take the dagger from his mouth, but in all else he remained unmoved."
"他说：“吉姆，我想咱俩都耍了不少花招，咱们还是来个协议吧。要不是刚才船突然倾斜，我就抓住你了，但是我没那运气，太倒霉。看样子，我这老水手得向你这个小孩子认输了，吉姆，真是难以接受。”","“Jim,” said he, “I reckon we’re fouled, you and me, and we’ll have to sign articles.I’d have had you but for that there lurch, but I don’t have no luck, not I; and I reckon I’ll have to strike, which comes hard, you see, for a master mariner to a ship’s younker like you, Jim.”"
"我陶醉于这番恭维话，得意洋洋，骄傲得像只飞上墙的公鸡。就在这一刹那，他的右手突然向后一挥。不知什么东西像箭一样从空中飞来。我感到自己挨了一下，一阵剧痛，肩膀竟被钉在了桅杆上。我疼痛难忍，也很惊讶。很难说当时是有意识地开了枪，但我敢肯定地说当时并未有意识地瞄准。我两支手枪同时开火，然后两支枪都从手中掉了下去。可不只是我那两支枪掉下去了。随着一声哽咽的喊叫，那水手松开了抓着绳子的手，头朝下掉进了海里。　","I was drinking in his words and smiling away, as conceited as a cock upon a wall, when, all in a breath, back went his right hand over his shoulder.Something sang like an arrow through the air; I felt a blow and then a sharp pang, and there I was pinned by the shoulder to the mast.In the horrid pain and surprise of the moment—I scarce can say it was by my own volition, and I am sure it was without a conscious aim—both my pistols went off, and both escaped out of my hands.They did not fall alone; with a choked cry, the coxswain loosed his grasp upon the shrouds and plunged head first into the water."
"第二十七章 “八个里亚尔”","Chapter 27 “Pieces of Eight”  "
"由于船身倾斜，桅杆远远地伸到水面上。我在桅顶桁梁上，下面只有一湾海水。汉兹刚才没爬这么高，因此离船近一些，正好掉在我和舷墙之间的水里。他在泛着血红泡沫的水中浮上来一次，然后就永远地沉了下去。水面平静之后，我看到他全身缩成一团，浮在船身的影子里，四周是清澈明亮的沙床上。有一两条鱼从他身旁游过。有时，随着海水的起伏，他似乎又动了动，像要站起来似的。但他确实死了，要么被枪打死，要么被水淹死了，他本打算在这儿杀我，现在自己却在此地葬身鱼腹了。","Owing to the cant of the vessel, the masts hung far out over the water, and from my perch on the cross-trees I had nothing below me but the surface of the bay.Hands, who was not so far up, was in consequence nearer to the ship and fell between me and the bulwarks.He rose once to the surface in a lather of foam and blood and then sank again for good.As the water settled, I could see him lying huddled together on the clean, bright sand in the shadow of the vessel’s sides.A fish or two whipped past his body.Sometimes, by the quivering of the water, he appeared to move a little, as if he were trying to rise.But he was dead enough, for all that, being both shot and drowned, and was food for fish in the very place where he had designed my slaughter."
"第二十八章 身在敌营","Chapter 28 In the Enemy’s Camp "
"火把的红光照亮了木屋里面，呈现在眼前的就是我所担心的最糟糕的情况。海盗们已经占了木屋和食品。 一桶白兰地、猪肉和面包还在老地方，但使我倍加恐惧的是屋里没有一个俘虏。我只能推测他们全都丧生了，同时为自己没能和他们生死与共而痛苦万分。","The red glare of the torch, lighting up the interior of the block house, showed me the worst of my apprehensions realized.The pirates were in possession of the house and stores: there was the cask of cognac, there were the pork and bread, as before, and what tenfold increased my horror, not a sign of any prisoner.I could only judge that all had perished, and my heart smote me sorely that I had not been there to perish with them."
"屋中一共有六个海盗，再也没有其他活人。其中五个人跳了起来，因从醉梦中被惊醒而气得涨红了脸。第六个家伙撑着胳膊坐了起来，脸色惨白，脑袋上缠着染血的绷带，这一切说明他最近刚受过伤，包扎的时间还不长。我想起了那天大战时被打伤逃进树林里的那个海盗，肯定就是他。","There were six of the buccaneers, all told; not another man was left alive.Five of them were on their feet, flushed and swollen, suddenly called out of the first sleep of drunkenness.The sixth had only risen upon his elbow; he was deadly pale, and the blood-stained bandage round his head told that he had recently been wounded, and still more recently dressed.I remembered the man who had been shot and had run back among the woods in the great attack, and doubted not that this was he."
"鹦鹉坐在高个子约翰的肩上整理羽毛。我觉得西尔弗本人似乎脸色也比平常苍白些，肌肉绷得更紧些。他仍穿着那天和我们谈判时那套漂亮的绒面呢礼服，但上面沾满了泥土，好几处还被灌木丛中的荆棘划破了，穿起来不好看。","The parrot sat, preening her plumage, on Long John’s shoulder.He himself, I thought, looked somewhat paler and more stern than I was used to.He still wore the fine broadcloth suit in which he had fulfilled his mission, but it was bitterly the worse for wear, daubed with clay and torn with the sharp briers of the wood."
"他说：“啊，原来是吉姆·霍金斯，该死的！来做客，是吗？来，来，欢迎！”","“So,” said he, “here’s Jim Hawkins, shiver my timbers!Dropped in, like, eh?Well, come, I take that friendly.”"
"他说着就在白兰地桶上坐下来，开始装烟斗。","And thereupon he sat down across the brandy cask and began to fill a pipe."
"“迪克，借个火。”他说。点着了烟斗后，他又说道：“行了，伙计，将火把插在柴火堆上吧。你们都躺下吧！你们不必为霍金斯先生站着。相信我的话，他不会介意的。我说，吉姆啊！”他取下嘴里的烟斗，“你来这里，真使可怜的老约翰喜出望外。 我第一次见到你就看出你非常机灵，可你这会儿跑到我这儿来，真让我糊涂了。”","“Give me a loan of the link, Dick,” said he; and then, when he had a good light, “That’ll do, lad,”he added; “stick the glim in the wood heap; and you, gentlemen, bring yourselves to!You needn’t stand up for Mr. Hawkins; HE’LL excuse you, you may lay to that.And so, Jim”—stopping the tobacco—“here you were, and quite a pleasant surprise for poor old John.I see you were smart when first I set my eyes on you, but this here gets away from me clean, it do.”"
"大家也能想象到，无论他说什么，我一言不发。他们把我按在墙上，让我背靠墙站在那里，正对着西尔弗的脸。我表面上毫无惧色，心里却绝望至极。","To all this, as may be well supposed, I made no answer.They had set me with my back against the wall, and I stood there, looking Silver in the face, pluckily enough, I hope, to all outward appearance, but with black despair in my heart."
"西尔弗从容地抽了一两口烟，又接着调侃起来。","Silver took a whiff or two of his pipe with great composure and then ran on again."
"他接着说：“吉姆，既然你已经来到这儿，我得和你说说心里话。我一直很喜欢你，真的，总觉得你有志气、年轻英俊，简直就是我年轻时的样子。我一直希望你加入我们这边来，分到你该得的那份财宝，一辈子做个有脸面的人。现在，你到底还是来了，我的孩子。斯莫利特船长是一流的海员，我一直这么说，但他太固执守旧。他常将‘公事公办’挂在嘴上，这倒没错。可你却撇下船长一个人跑了！医生恨死你了，骂你是‘忘恩负义的混蛋’。总而言之，你再也回不到那边去了，因为他们不要你了，除非你自己创建第三套班子当光杆司令，否则你就只能加入到我西尔弗船长这伙了。”","“Now, you see, Jim, so be as you ARE here,” said he, “I’ll give you a piece of my mind.I’ve always liked you, I have, for a lad of spirit, and the picter of my own self when I was young and handsome.I always wanted you to jine and take your share, and die a gentleman, and now, my cock, you’ve got to.Cap’n Smollett’s a fine seaman, as I’ll own up to any day, but stiff on discipline.‘Dooty is dooty,’ says he, and right he is.Just you keep clear of the cap’n.The doctor himself is gone dead again you—’ungrateful scamp’ was what he said; and the short and the long of the whole story is about here: you can’t go back to your own lot, for they won’t have you; and without you start a third ship’s company all by yourself, which might be lonely, you’ll have to jine with Cap’n Silver.”"
"到目前为止一切都好。我的朋友们还活着。虽然我相信西尔弗的话有一部分是真的，小木屋里的人对我擅自逃跑很愤怒，但他的话给我带来的安慰仍然大于忧伤。","So far so good.My friends, then, were still alive, and though I partly believed the truth of Silver’s statement, that the cabin party were incensed at me for my desertion, I was more relieved than distressed by what I heard."
"西尔弗接着说：“你已经落到了我们手中，我不说，你也明白。我喜欢与人讲道理，因为我从来没看到威胁有什么好结果。如果你愿意就加入我们这伙；如果你不愿意就可以说不干，吉姆，你可以自由选择，伙计。要是世上还有哪个水手能说出比这更公道的话来，那我就不得好死！”","“I don’t say nothing as to your being in our hands,” continued Silver, “though there you are, and you may lay to it.I’m all for argyment; I never seen good come out o’ threatening.If you like the service, well, you’ll jine; and if you don’t, Jim, why, you’re free to answer no—free and welcome, shipmate; and if fairer can be said by mortal seaman, shiver my sides!”"
"“我必须回答吗？”我用颤抖的声音问。听着这番捉弄人的话，我觉得死亡的威胁近在眼前。我脸颊发热，心也跳得厉害。","“Am I to answer, then?” I asked with a very tremulous voice.Through all this sneering talk, I was made to feel the threat of death that overhung me, and my cheeks burned and my heart beat painfully in my breast."
"西尔弗又说：“小伙子，没人逼你。好好想想。我们谁也不会催你，伙计，你瞧，和你在一起的时间总是过得很愉快。”","“Lad,” said Silver, “no one’s a pressing of you.Take your bearings.None of us won’t hurry you, mate; time goes so pleasant in your company, you see.”"
"我胆子大了些，接着说道：“好吧，如果要我选择的话，我声明我有权知道这里到底发生了什么事，你们为什么在这里，我的朋友们到哪里去了？”","“Well,” said I, growing a bit bolder, “if I’m to choose, I declare I have a right to know what’s what, and why you’re here, and where my friends are.”"
"一个海盗低声咆哮着重复道：“发生了什么事？鬼才知道这里发生了什么事！”","“Wot’s wot?” repeated one of the buccaneers in a deep growl.“Ah, he’d be a lucky one as knowed that!”"
"西尔弗粗暴地朝说话的人吼道：“最好给我闭上你那张臭嘴！”接着，他还用刚才那种亲切的声音回答道：“霍金斯先生，昨天早上，利夫西医生举着白旗来找我们。他说：‘西尔弗船长，你们被出卖了。船已经开走了。’是的，也许是我们晚上喝酒唱歌，这时候他们把船开走了。这一点我不否认。至少我们谁也没注意到。听了利夫西的话后，往外一看，那船真他妈不见了！我从没见过一群傻瓜干瞪眼的蠢相，而且实话告诉你，我当时看起来最蠢。医生又说：‘那好，让我们谈判吧。’于是我和他开始谈条件，最后我们商定：补给品、白兰地、木屋、你们仔细劈好的柴火。用我们的话来说，这条‘福船’从桅顶到龙骨都归我们了。至于他们，反正他们已经走了，我可不知道他们在哪儿。”","“You’ll perhaps batten down your hatches till you’re spoke to, my friend,” cried Silver truculently to this speaker.And then, in his first gracious tones, he replied to me, “Yesterday morning, Mr. Hawkins,” said he, “in the dog-watch, down came Doctor Livesey with a flag of truce.Says he, ‘Cap’n Silver, you’re sold out.Ship’s gone.’ Well, maybe we’d been taking a glass, and a song to help it round.I won’t say no.Leastways, none of us had looked out.We looked out, and by thunder, the old ship was gone!I never seen a pack o’ fools look fishier; and you may lay to that, if I tells you that looked the fishiest.‘Well,’ says the doctor, ‘let’s bargain.’ We bargained, him and I, and here we are: stores, brandy, block house, the firewood you was thoughtful enough to cut, and in a manner of speaking, the whole blessed boat, from cross-trees to kelson.As for them, they’ve tramped; I don’t know where’s they are.”"
"他又默默地抽了几口烟。","He drew again quietly at his pipe."
"他接着说:“为了不让你多心，你也包括在我们谈判条件内，我可以告诉你最后几句话。 我问：‘你们有多少人要离开木屋？’他答：‘四个，其中一个受了伤。那个孩子不知道哪去了，真见鬼，我也不管了。我们也都烦他了。’这是当时他的话。”","“And lest you should take it into that head of yours,” he went on, “that you was included in the treaty, here’s the last word that was said: ‘How many are you,’ says I, ‘to leave?‘ ‘Four,’ says he; ‘four, and one of us wounded.As for that boy, I don’t know where he is, confound him,’ says he, ‘nor I don’t much care.We’re about sick of him.’ These was his words."
"“就这些吗？”我问道。","“Is that all?” I asked."
"“嗯，孩子，能让你听的就这些了。”西尔弗回答道。","“Well, it’s all that you’re to hear, my son,” returned Silver."
"“我现在必须抉择了？”","“And now I am to choose?”"
"西尔弗说：“现在你必须作出选择，你要相信我的话。”","“And now you are to choose, and you may lay to that,” said Silver."
"我答道：“好吧，我还没笨到不知道做出什么选择的地步。你们想怎么着就怎么着，我不在乎。自从遇到你们，我见了很多死人了。”“不过，我有一两件事情要告诉你们。”我接着说，而且开始兴奋起来，“首先，你们现在处境很糟，丢了船，丢了财宝，整个计划都泡汤了。如果你想知道是谁干的——告诉你是我！在我们看见陆地的那天晚上，我在苹果桶里听到了你——约翰，你——迪克·约翰逊，还有已经淹死在海里的汉兹之间的谈话，并且不到一小时就把你们的话全都告诉了我们的人。至于大船，是我割断了缆绳，是我杀了你们守船的人，也是我将她驾驶到了你们永远也找不到的地方，你们谁也别想找到她。该受嘲笑的是你们。我从一开始就占上风，你们在我眼里没比一只苍蝇可怕。要杀要放随你们便。但我还要说一点，如果你们放了我，那过去的事就算了。 将来如果你们因当过海盗而受审，我将尽力救你们。现在轮到你们选择了。再杀一个对你们没什么好处，放了我留下一个证人，以后还可以使你们免受绞刑。”","“Well,” said I, “I am not such a fool but I know pretty well what I have to look for.Let the worst come to the worst, it’s little I care.I’ve seen too many die since I fell in with you.But there’s a thing or two I have to tell you,” I said, and by this time I was quite excited; “and the first is this: here you are, in a bad way—ship lost, treasure lost, men lost, your whole business gone to wreck; and if you want to know who did it—it was I!I was in the apple barrel the night we sighted land, and I heard you, John, and you, Dick Johnson, and Hands, who is now at the bottom of the sea, and told every word you said before the hour was out.And as for the schooner, it was I who cut her cable, and it was I that killed the men you had aboard of her, and it was I who brought her where you’ll never see her more, not one of you.The laugh’s on my side; I’ve had the top of this business from the first; I no more fear you than I fear a fly.Kill me, if you please, or spare me.But one thing I’ll say, and no more; if you spare me, bygones are bygones, and when you fellows are in court for piracy, I’ll save you all I can.It is for you to choose.Kill another and do yourselves no good, or spare me and keep a witness to save you from the gallows.”"
"我停了下来，因为我已经说得快喘不上气了。 使我感到惊讶的是，他们谁也没动，全都坐在那儿像群绵羊一样看着我。当他们还在盯着我的时候，我又脱口说道：“西尔弗先生，我现在相信你是这些人中最好的。 万一我出事了，请你告诉医生我是怎么做的，我会万分感激。”","I stopped, for, I tell you, I was out of breath, and to my wonder, not a man of them moved, but all sat staring at me like as many sheep.And while they were still staring, I broke out again, “And now, Mr. Silver,” I said, “I believe you’re the best man here, and if things go to the worst, I’ll take it kind of you to let the doctor know the way I took it.”"
"“我会记住的。”西尔弗用非常古怪的语气说道，我怎么也判断不出他究竟是在嘲笑我提出的请求呢，还是被我的勇气打动了。","“I’ll bear it in mind,” said Silver with an accent so curious that I could not, for the life of me, decide whether he were laughing at my request or had been favourably affected by my courage."
"“我还要补充一点。”那个脸色像红桃木的老水手说，他叫摩根，我在布里斯托尔码头上高个子约翰开的酒店里见过他。“就是他认出的黑狗。”","“I’ll put one to that,” cried the old mahogany-faced seaman—Morgan by name—whom I had seen in Long John’s public-house upon the quays of Bristol.“It was him that knowed Black Dog.”"
"船上的厨子又补了一句：“嗯，还有呢。妈的，我还知道另外一件事。也正是这小子从比利·博恩斯那里骗到藏宝图的。总而言之，我们全被毁在吉姆· 霍金斯手里了！”","“Well, and see here,” added the sea-cook.“I’ll put another again to that, by thunder!For it was this same boy that faked the chart from Billy Bones.First and last, we’ve split upon Jim Hawkins!”"
"“那就杀了他！”摩根咒骂着说道。","“Then here goes!” said Morgan with an oath."
"他拔出刀子跳了起来，利落得像个二十岁的小伙子。","And he sprang up, drawing his knife as if he had been twenty."
"西尔弗大吼道：“站住！汤姆·摩根，你以为你是谁？你大概以为自己是一船之长吧！我要好好教训教训你！跟我作对，你就和死在你面前的那些人一样，滚到地狱去。总的说来，三十年了，跟我作对的，有的被吊死在帆顶，有的被扔到海里，都喂了鱼。谁跟我作对绝对没有好日子过。汤姆·摩根，你给我记住我的话。”","“Avast, there!” cried Silver.“Who are you, Tom Morgan?Maybe you thought you was cap’n here, perhaps.By the powers, but I’ll teach you better!Cross me, and you’ll go where many a good man’s gone before you, first and last, these thirty year back—some to the yard-arm, shiver my timbers, and some by the board, and all to feed the fishes.There’s never a man looked me between the eyes and seen a good day a’terwards, Tom Morgan, you may lay to that.”"
"摩根顿住了，但其他几个人却低声抱怨起来。","Morgan paused, but a hoarse murmur rose from the others."
"一个人说：“汤姆说得对。”","“Tom’s right,” said one."
"另一个人补充道：“我一直都太糊涂了。约翰·西尔弗，如果我再让你糊弄我，我就真要上绞架了。”","“I stood hazing long enough from one,” added another.“I’ll be hanged if I’ll be hazed by you, John Silver.”"
"“你们诸位先生当中还有谁要和我争论一番吗？”西尔弗咆哮着从酒桶上将身子探出去老远，烟斗在他右手中还冒着烟。“有什么话全都说出来，你们又不是哑巴。谁想说谁就站出来。我活了这么多年，难道到了现在还会让什么酒囊饭袋在我面前摆谱吗？你们知道自己是靠运气过日子的人，那就该知道怎么做。我准备好了。有种的拔出弯刀来见个高低。 尽管我拄着拐杖，但我在抽完一斗烟之前就要看看他的五脏六腑是什么颜色。”","“Did any of you gentlemen want to have it out with me?” roared Silver, bending far forward from his position on the keg, with his pipe still glowing in his right hand.“Put a name on what you’re at; you ain’t dumb, I reckon.Him that wants shall get it.Have I lived this many years, and a son of a rum puncheon cock his hat athwart my hawse at the latter end of it?You know the way; you’re all gentlemen o’ fortune, by your account.Well, I’m ready.Take a cutlass, him that dares, and I’ll see the colour of his inside, crutch and all, before that pipe’s empty.”"
"没人动，也没人答话。","Not a man stirred; not a man answered."
"“你们就这副德性，是吗？”他又说了一句，把烟斗重新刁在嘴上。“哼！你们真是丢人现眼。连一个敢站出来决斗的都没有。也许你们连人话都听不懂！我是你们选出来的船长。我之所以当船长，就是因为我经历过大风大浪，比你们都强。既然你们不敢像真正的海盗那样和我较量，那你们就得听我的，你们都给我记住这一点！我喜欢这孩子，还从来没有见过哪个孩子比他更聪明。他比你们这帮鼠辈中任何两个加一块都更像个男子汉。 我想说的是，我倒要看看谁敢碰他一下试试，我就不客气。你们给我记住了。”","“That’s your sort, is it?” he added, returning his pipe to his mouth.“Well, you’re a gay lot to look at, anyway.Not much worth to fight, you ain’t.P’r’aps you can understand King George’s English.I’m cap’n here by ‘lection.I’m cap’n here because I’m the best man by a long sea-mile.You won’t fight, as gentlemen o’ fortune should; then, by thunder, you’ll obey, and you may lay to it!I like that boy, now; I never seen a better boy than that.He’s more a man than any pair of rats of you in this here house, and what I say is this: let me see him that’ll lay a hand on him—that’s what I say, and you may lay to it.”"
"接下来便是长时间的沉默。我靠墙站直了身体，心里像有锤敲着咚咚跳个不停，但心中却闪现出一线希望。西尔弗背靠着墙，双臂交叉，烟斗斜刁在嘴角，镇静得像是在教堂里一样。然而眼睛却偷偷地四处张望，眼角始终盯着那帮不守规矩的手下。那几个海盗渐渐退到了木屋的另一端，聚在那里交头接耳的声音像小溪声不停地传进我的耳朵。他们有时也会抬起头来看一眼，火把的红光把他们紧张的面孔照亮一两秒钟。他们的视线正对的是西尔弗，而不是我。","There was a long pause after this.I stood straight up against the wall, my heart still going like a sledge-hammer, but with a ray of hope now shining in my bosom.Silver leant back against the wall, his arms crossed, his pipe in the corner of his mouth, as calm as though he had been in church; yet his eye kept wandering furtively, and he kept the tail of it on his unruly followers.They, on their part, drew gradually together towards the far end of the block house, and the low hiss of their whispering sounded in my ear continuously, like a stream.One after another, they would look up, and the red light of the torch would fall for a second on their nervous faces; but it was not towards me, it was towards Silver that they turned their eyes."
"西尔弗朝空中吐了口痰，说道：“你们好像有很多话要说。要么大点声让我也听听，要么就给我闭嘴。”","“You seem to have a lot to say,” remarked Silver, spitting far into the air.“Pipe up and let me hear it, or lay to.”"
"其中一人回答道：“请你原谅，先生。有些规矩你可以不遵守，不过有些规矩你最好还是遵守。我们都对你很不满，不愿意再任你宰割。我们有同其他船上水手一样的权利，我们有权这么做，因为根据你自己订下的规矩，我们可以在一起商量。请你原谅，先生，因为我承认你现在仍是船长，不过我要行使我的权利，到外面去与人商量。”","“Ax your pardon, sir,” returned one of the men; “you’re pretty free with some of the rules; maybe you’ll kindly keep an eye upon the rest.This crew’s dissatisfied; this crew don’t vally bullying a marlin-spike; this crew has its rights like other crews, I’ll make so free as that; and by your own rules, I take it we can talk together.I ax your pardon, sir, acknowledging you for to be captaing at this present; but I claim my right, and steps outside for a council.”"
"这个面貌凶恶、黄眼珠，大概三十五岁左右的高个水手，行了个漂亮的水手礼，沉着地走到门口，消失在了夜幕中。其他人都跟着走了出去，每个人经过西尔弗身旁时都向他敬了个礼，说句抱歉的话。“按规矩办。”有个人说。“开个水手会。”摩根说。就这样，他们每人说了句话就走了出去，留下我和西尔弗站在火把旁。","And with an elaborate sea-salute, this fellow, a long, ill-looking, yellow-eyed man of five and thirty, stepped coolly towards the door and disappeared out of the house.One after another the rest followed his example, each making a salute as he passed, each adding some apology.“According to rules,” said one.“Forecastle council,” said Morgan.And so with one remark or another all marched out and left Silver and me alone with the torch."
"西尔弗立刻把烟斗从嘴里拿下来。","The sea-cook instantly removed his pipe."
"他用勉强可以听见的声音对我耳语道：“现在，你听我说，吉姆·霍金斯，你很危险，更恐怖的是你可能还会受折磨。他们打算推翻我。但是你听着，无论如何，我都会保护你。我本没想这么做，但你说了那番话后，我改变了主意。我基本上全输光了，而且可能还会被吊死。但我觉得你说得对。所以我对自己说：‘约翰，只要你站在霍金斯一边，霍金斯将来也会站在你这边。你是他的最后一张王牌，约翰，他也是你的最后一张王牌！互相帮忙嘛。’我说。你救了这个证人，将来他就会救你的命。”","“Now, look you here, Jim Hawkins,” he said in a steady whisper that was no more than audible, “you’re within half a plank of death, and what’s a long sight worse, of torture.They’re going to throw me off.But, you mark, I stand by you through thick and thin.I didn’t mean to; no, not till you spoke up.I was about desperate to lose that much blunt, and be hanged into the bargain.But I see you was the right sort.I says to myself, you stand by Hawkins, John, and Hawkins’ll stand by you.You’re his last card, and by the living thunder, John, he’s yours!Back to back, says I.You save your witness, and he’ll save your neck!”"
"我隐约开始明白他的意思了。","I began dimly to understand."
"“你是说一切都完了？”我问道。","“You mean all’s lost?” I asked."
"他答道：“嗯，天作证，我觉得是完了！","“Aye, by gum, I do!” he answered."
"船没了，命也没了——就是这么回事。那天我一看海湾里没船了，吉姆·霍金斯，尽管我很坚强，但还是很泄气。至于外面那帮家伙和他们所谓的会议，你听着，他们都是十足的笨蛋和懦夫。只要我能做得到，我一定把你从他们手中救出来。不过，你听着，吉姆——一报还一报——你到时候也得从绞架上救下高个子约翰。”","“Ship gone, neck gone—that’s the size of it.Once I looked into that bay, Jim Hawkins, and seen no schooner well, I’m tough, but I gave out.As for that lot and their council, mark me, they’re outright fools and cowards.I’ll save your life—if so be as I can—from them.But, see here, Jim—tit for tat—you save Long John from swinging.”"
"像他这么一个老海盗，一个十足的犯罪头子，居然会提出希望这么渺茫的事，我十分吃惊。","I was bewildered; it seemed a thing so hopeless he was asking—he, the old buccaneer, the ringleader throughout."
"我说：“能做的我一定做。”","“What I can do, that I’ll do,” I said."
"高个子约翰大喊道：“就这么说定了！你说话像个男子汉。妈的，我有活命的机会了。”","“It’s a bargain!” cried Long John.“You speak up plucky, and by thunder, I’ve a chance!”"
"他拄着拐杖走到插在柴堆上的火把旁，重新点燃烟斗。","He hobbled to the torch, where it stood propped among the firewood, and took a fresh light to his pipe."
"他又走回来说：“相信我，吉姆。我是个聪明人，真的。我现在已经站到乡绅这边了。我知道你把船开到什么安全的地方了。虽然我不知道你是怎么做的，但我知道船是安全的。我猜想汉兹和奥布赖恩的尸体已经泡烂了吧。我从来都信不过他们俩。你听清楚了！我什么问题也不问你，也不让别人问你。我知道我是完了，我也知道你是个忠诚可靠的小伙子。你这么年轻，你我也许可以一起干出点名堂来！”","“Understand me, Jim,” he said, returning.“I’ve a head on my shoulders, I have.I’m on squire’s side now.I know you’ve got that ship safe somewheres.How you done it, I don’t know, but safe it is.I guess Hands and O’Brien turned soft.I never much believed in neither of THEM.Now you mark me.I ask no questions, nor I won’t let others.I know when a game’s up, I do; and I know a lad that’s staunch.Ah, you that’s young—you and me might have done a power of good together!”"
"他从酒桶里倒了些白兰地到一个小锡杯里。","He drew some cognac from the cask into a tin cannikin."
"“你尝点吗，伙计？”他问道。见我谢绝后，他又说：“那我就自己喝了，吉姆。我得精神点儿，因为麻烦事马上就来了。说到麻烦事，吉姆，医生为什么把那张图给我？”","“Will you taste, messmate?”He asked; and when I had refused: “Well, I’ll take a drain myself, Jim,” said he.“I need a caulker, for there’s trouble on hand.And talking o’ trouble, why did that doctor give me the chart, Jim?”"
"我脸上的惊讶绝非装出来的，所以他立刻明白问我也没用。","My face expressed a wonder so unaffected that he saw the needlessness of further questions."
"他说：“真的，他确实把图给我了。这背后一定有文章。吉姆，这背后肯定有文章，不知是祸是福。”","“Ah, well, he did, though,” said he.“And there’s something under that, no doubt—something, surely, under that, Jim—bad or good.”"
"他又喝了一大口白兰地，晃晃他那长着浅色头发的大脑袋，像一个等待厄运临头的人。","And he took another swallow of the brandy, shaking his great fair head like a man who looks forward to the worst."
"第二十九章 又见黑券","Chapter 29 The Black Spot Again "
"海盗们的会议持续了一段时间后，其中一人重新回到木屋，像刚才一样还是行了个礼，在我看来很有讽刺意味，然后请求借用一会火把。西尔弗马上就同意了，于是这个使者又走了，留我们俩在黑暗中。","The council of buccaneers had lasted some time, when one of them re-entered the house, and with a repetition of the same salute, which had in my eyes an ironical air, begged for a moment’s loan of the torch.Silver briefly agreed, and this emissary retired again, leaving us together in the dark."
"“要起风了，吉姆。”西尔弗说。现在，他对我的态度变得十分友好而亲切。","“There’s a breeze coming, Jim,” said Silver, who had by this time adopted quite a friendly and familiar tone."
"我走到离我最近的一个射击孔往外看。那一大堆篝火的余烬这时已经烧完了，只剩一点微弱暗淡的火光，我这才明白那些密谋者为什么要火把。他们全聚在木屋与栅栏之间的斜坡上，其中一人举着火把，另一人跪在他们中间。 我看到打开的刀刃在月光和火光的映照下不断地变换着颜色。剩下的人微微俯身向前，像是在看他做什么。我只能看到他手中有把刀和一本书。我正想着他们怎么会有这两样极不协调的东西时，跪在地上的人站了起来，和其他几个一起向木屋走来。","I turned to the loophole nearest me and looked out.The embers of the great fire had so far burned themselves out and now glowed so low and duskily that I understood why these conspirators desired a torch.About half-way down the slope to the stockade, they were collected in a group; one held the light, another was on his knees in their midst, and I saw the blade of an open knife shine in his hand with varying colours in the moon and torchlight.The rest were all somewhat stooping, as though watching the manoeuvres of this last.I could just make out that he had a book as well as a knife in his hand, and was still wondering how anything so incongruous had come in their possession when the kneeling figure rose once more to his feet and the whole party began to move together towards the house."
"“他们来了。”我说着回到了原来的位置，因为我觉得让他们知道我在偷看似乎有损我的尊严。","“Here they come,” said I; and I returned to my former position, for it seemed beneath my dignity that they should find me watching them."
"西尔弗高兴地说：“让他们来吧，伙计，让他们来吧。我还有一手没使出来呢。”","“Well, let ‘em come, lad—let ‘em come,” said Silver cheerily.“I’ve still a shot in my locker.”"
"门开了，他们五个人挤着站在门口，将其中一人往前推。这个人慢慢往前走，每走一步都要犹豫一下，握得紧紧的右手伸在前面，要是换了任何别的场合，你一定会觉得可笑极了。","The door opened, and the five men, standing huddled together just inside, pushed one of their number forward.In any other circumstances it would have been comical to see his slow advance, hesitating as he set down each foot, but holding his closed right hand in front of him."
"西尔弗喊道：“过来，伙计。我不会吃了你。拿过来，傻大个儿。我懂规矩，真的，不会伤害使者的。”","“Step up, lad,” cried Silver.“I won’t eat you.Hand it over, lubber.I know the rules, I do; I won’t hurt a depytation.”"
"受了鼓舞，那个海盗胆子稍微大了些，加快了步子将一样东西放到西尔弗手里，然后立刻退回到了同伴当中。","Thus encouraged, the buccaneer stepped forth more briskly, and having passed something to Silver, from hand to hand, slipped yet more smartly back again to his companions."
"船上的厨子看了看交给他的东西。","The sea-cook looked at what had been given him."
"“黑券！果然如此。”他说道。“你们从哪儿弄来的纸？天啊！瞧！瞧你们干的事，这太不吉利了！你们居然从《圣经》上割下这张纸！哪个混蛋割的《圣经》？”","“The black spot!I thought so,” he observed.“Where might you have got the paper?Why, hillo!Look here, now; this ain’t lucky!You’ve gone and cut this out of a Bible.What fool’s cut a Bible?”"
"摩根说：“啊！糟了！糟了！我说什么来着？我早就说这事没有好结果。”","“Ah, there!” said Morgan.“There!Wot did I say?No good’ll come o’ that, I said.”"
"西尔弗接着说道：“好吧，你们看样子已经决定了。我告诉你们，你们都会被绞死的！《圣经》是哪个蠢货的？”","“Well, you’ve about fixed it now, among you,” continued Silver.“You’ll all swing now, I reckon.What soft-headed lubber had a Bible?”"
"“是迪克的。”一个海盗说。","“It was Dick,” said one."
"“迪克，是你的吗？那你就祷告吧。”西尔弗说道，“迪克的好运算是到头了，你们可以记住我的话。”","“Dick, was it?Then Dick can get to prayers,” said Silver.“He’s seen his slice of luck, has Dick, and you may lay to that.”"
"但这时黄眼珠的大个子插嘴了。","But here the long man with the yellow eyes struck in."
"他说：“闭嘴吧，约翰·西尔弗。按照规矩，这些水手已经全部同意将这黑券交给了你，你也应该按规矩将它翻过来看看背面写的什么。然后你再发表意见。”","“Belay that talk, John Silver,” he said.“This crew has tipped you the black spot in full council, as in dooty bound; just you turn it over, as in dooty bound, and see what’s wrote there.Then you can talk.”"
"西尔弗说：“乔治，谢谢你！你向来办事神速，也向来懂规矩，乔治，这正是我喜欢看到的。好吧，不管怎么说，我看看写的什么。哈！‘下台’——是这个意思吧？字写得很漂亮，我敢保证，像铅印的一样。乔治，这是你的字迹吧？怎么说呢，你在这群水手中间越来越像个头儿了呢。你会成为下一个船长，我不觉得奇怪。再把火把借我用一下，好吗？我这烟又不太好吸了。”","“Thanky, George,” replied the sea-cook.“You always was brisk for business, and has the rules by heart, George, as I’m pleased to see.Well, what is it, anyway?Ah!‘Deposed’—that’s it, is it?Very pretty wrote, to be sure; like print, I swear.Your hand o’ write, George?Why, you was gettin’ quite a leadin’ man in this here crew.You’ll be cap’n next, I shouldn’t wonder.Just oblige me with that torch again, will you?This pipe don’t draw.”"
"乔治说：“行了。现在不要再愚弄我们了。你过去那套很管用，但这会儿不管事了。你还是从那酒桶上跳下来，让我们投票吧。”","“Come, now,” said George, “you don’t fool this crew no more.You’re a funny man, by your account; but you’re over now, and you’ll maybe step down off that barrel and help vote.”"
"西尔弗轻蔑地说：“我还以为你真知道规矩呢。如果你不记得，我记得。让我教你：记住，我现在还是你们的船长，你们先提出对我不满的地方，然后我再答复你们。 在这之前，你们的黑券一文不值。这之后，咱们走着瞧。”","“I thought you said you knowed the rules,” returned Silver contemptuously.“Leastways, if you don’t, I do; and I wait here—and I’m still your cap’n, mind—till you outs with your grievances and I reply; in the meantime, your black spot ain’t worth a biscuit.After that, we’ll see.”"
"乔治答道：“哦，你不必担心，我们都很公道。第一，你将这次航行弄得乱七八糟的——你要敢否认，算你有种。第二，你白白让敌人离开了困住他们的这个陷阱。他们为什么想离开？我不知道，但很明显他们想走。第三，你不让我们去追他们。嗯，我们把你看透了，你想耍花招，这就是你的不是了。还有第四，你还偏向这小子。”","“Oh,” replied George, “you don’t be under no kind of apprehension; WE’RE all square, we are.First, you’ve made a hash of this cruise—you’ll be a bold man to say no to that.Second, you let the enemy out o’ this here trap for nothing.Why did they want out? I dunno, but it’s pretty plain they wanted it.Third, you wouldn’t let us go at them upon the march.Oh, we see through you, John Silver; you want to play booty, that’s what’s wrong with you.And then, fourth, there’s this here boy.”"
"“还有吗？”西尔弗平静地问。","“Is that all?” asked Silver quietly."
"乔治反驳道：“这就已经足够了。就因为你，我们都得死，早晚得被日头晒成干儿。”","“Enough, too,” retorted George.“We’ll all swing and sun-dry for your bungling.”"
"“好吧，现在我来答复这四条。一条一条给你们答复。我把这次航行搞得一团糟，是吗？那好，你们现在都知道我想干什么，而且还知道如果成功了，我们今晚早就回到了伊斯帕尼奥拉号，谁都没事，平平安安的。大家就可以在船上吃葡萄干，看着满满的金银财宝了。妈的！可是，谁挡了我的道呢？是谁在逼我这合法的船长下台呢？是谁在我们上岸的头一天就将黑券塞给我，然后嚣张地表演呢？这场戏演得不错，包括我自己在内，还真像伦敦城外正法码头上脖子套着绳圈的号管舞呢，真像！到底是谁领的头？哼！是安迪生、汉兹，还有你乔治·梅里！在这几个惹事儿的家伙当中，只有你还没有去见龙王爷，而你现在却蛮横地跳出来，想篡位当船长——就是你们几个坏了我们的大事！老天！这真是天底下最荒唐的事！”","“Well now, look here, I’ll answer these four p’ints; one after another I’ll answer ‘em.I made a hash o’ this cruise, did I?Well now, you all know what I wanted, and you all know if that had been done that we’d ‘a been aboard the HISPANIOLA this night as ever was, every man of us alive, and fit, and full of good plum-duff, and the treasure in the hold of her, by thunder!Well, who crossed me?Who forced my hand, as was the lawful cap’n?Who tipped me the black spot the day we landed and began this dance?Ah, it’s a fine dance—I’m with you there—and looks mighty like a hornpipe in a rope’s end at Execution Dock by London town, it does.But who done it?Why, it was Anderson, and Hands, and you, George Merry!And you’re the last above board of that same meddling crew; and you have the Davy Jones’s insolence to up and stand for cap’n over me—you, that sank the lot of us!By the powers!But this tops the stiffest yarn to nothing.”"
"西尔弗停了一会儿，从乔治和他新近结成的同伴们的表情上，我可以看出西尔弗这些话没白说。","Silver paused, and I could see by the faces of George and his late comrades that these words had not been said in vain."
"“这是第一点。”被告喊了起来，擦去额头上的汗珠，声音大得使整个木屋都震颤起来。“老实告诉你们，和你们说话简直让我恶心！。你们既没头脑也没记性，我真不明白你们的爹妈怎么会让你们到海上来。做水手！靠运气吃饭！我看你们也就做个裁缝还凑合。”","“That’s for number one,” cried the accused, wiping the sweat from his brow, for he had been talking with a vehemence that shook the house.“Why, I give you my word, I’m sick to speak to you.You’ve neither sense nor memory, and I leave it to fancy where your mothers was that let you come to sea.Sea!Gentlemen o’ fortune!I reckon tailors is your trade.”"
"摩根说：“约翰，接着说。另外几条呢？”","“Go on, John,” said Morgan.“Speak up to the others.”"
"约翰答道：“哦，另外几条！罪名够多的，是吧？你们说我把这趟航行毁啦。天啊！我敢打赌，你们根本不知道糟到了什么地步，听我说吧！我们离上绞架的日子不远了，我一想到这连脖子都会发硬。你们大概看见过，人用铁链吊着，鸟围着他们飞，海员路过时会指指点点。‘那是谁？’有人问。‘那个！当然是约翰·西尔弗啦。我和他很熟。’另一个人回答道。甚至连他们调转船头到达另一个浮标处时，他们仍然能听到那铁链发出的当啷声。这就是我们的下场。 我们都是爹妈生的，就因为他、汉兹、安迪生和你们当中另外一些干蠢事的笨蛋，我们就得是这个下场。如果你们想知道关于第四点，也就是为什么要护着这孩子，妈的！难道他不是个人质吗？为什么不好好利用一下呢？我们不能杀他，他是我们最后的机会，我觉得。杀了他？我不干，伙计们！还有第三条，是吗？嗯，第三条能说的还真挺多。也许你们没忘了一个真正的大学毕业的医生每天来看你们的事吧。你，约翰，脑袋受伤了；还有你，乔治·梅里，六小时前你还患着疟疾的，直到现在两眼还黄得跟柠檬皮似的。你们也许还不知道有条船会来接应吧？确实有，到时候，你们就知道手中有个人质的用处了。至于第二点，我为什么要和他们谈那笔交易。哼！当时你们跪在地上爬到我跟前求我的！你们跪着爬到我跟前，个个万分沮丧。如果我没有做那笔交易，你们早就饿死了。但这还是小事。你们看这儿——这就是为什么！”","“Ah, the others!” returned John.“They’re a nice lot, ain’t they?You say this cruise is bungled.Ah!By gum, if you could understand how bad it’s bungled, you would see!We’re that near the gibbet that my neck’s stiff with thinking on it.You’ve seen ‘em, maybe, hanged in chains, birds about ‘em, seamen p’inting ‘em out as they go down with the tide.‘Who’s that? ' says one.‘That!Why, that’s John Silver.I knowed him well,’ says another.And you can hear the chains a jangle as you go about and reach for the other buoy.Now, that’s about where we are, every mother’s son of us, thanks to him, and Hands, and Anderson, and other ruination fools of you.And if you want to know about number four, and that boy, why, shiver my timbers, isn’t he a hostage?Are we a going to waste a hostage?No, not us; he might be our last chance, and I shouldn’t wonder.Kill that boy?Not me, mates!And number three?Ah, well, there’s a deal to say to number three.Maybe you don’t count it nothing to have a real college doctor to see you every day—you, John, with your head broke—or you, George Merry, that had the ague shakes upon you not six hours agone, and has your eyes the colour of lemon peel to this same moment on the clock?And maybe, perhaps, you didn’t know there was a consort coming either?But there is, and not so long till then; and we’ll see who’ll be glad to have a hostage when it comes to that.And as for number two, and why I made a bargain—well, you came crawling on your knees to me to make it—on your knees you came, you was that downhearted—and you’d have starved too if I hadn’t—but that’s a trifle!You look there—that’s why!”"
"他说着就将一张纸扔到地上，我立刻就认出了它——正是我在船长箱子底部找到的那张用油布包着的已经发黄的藏宝图，上面划着三个红十字符。医生为什么把藏宝图给他们，我怎么也想不明白。","And he cast down upon the floor a paper that I instantly recognized—none other than the chart on yellow paper, with the three red crosses, that I had found in the oilcloth at the bottom of the captain’s chest.Why the doctor had given it to him was more than I could fancy."
"这事儿让我困惑，但这张图的出现却让幸存的海盗们喜出望外。他们立刻像猫捉老鼠一样扑向那张纸。图从一个人的手中传到另一个人的手中，看图时伴随着咒骂声、喊叫声、孩子般的笑声，你会以为他们不仅已经摸到了金银财宝，甚至已经把财宝装上船安全返航了。","But if it were inexplicable to me, the appearance of the chart was incredible to the surviving mutineers.They leaped upon it like cats upon a mouse.It went from hand to hand, one tearing it from another; and by the oaths and the cries and the childish laughter with which they accompanied their examination, you would have thought, not only they were fingering the very gold, but were at sea with it, besides, in safety."
"其中一人说：“对，这的确是弗林特的图。”这J.F，还有下面的画痕和这丁香花结，正是他的签名花样。”","“Yes,” said one, “that’s Flint, sure enough.J.F., and a score below, with a clove hitch to it; so he done ever.”"
"乔治说：“很好。但是我们没有船，怎么把财宝运走？”","“Mighty pretty,” said George.“But how are we to get away with it, and us no ship.”"
"西尔弗猛地跳了起来，用手撑着墙，大声喊道：“乔治，我警告你！”他吼道：“如果你再胡说八道一句，我就跟你决斗！怎么运走？我怎么知道！这应该由你来告诉我——就是你们那几个该死的笨蛋的介入，才害得我丢了大船！不会是你，你不行！你是当然没法将财宝运走的！你蠢得都不如一只蟑螂。但你可以说话客气点，乔治·梅里，你记住我的话。”","Silver suddenly sprang up, and supporting himself with a hand against the wall: “Now I give you warning, George,” he cried.“One more word of your sauce, and I’ll call you down and fight you.How?Why, how do I know?You had ought to tell me that—you and the rest, that lost me my schooner, with your interference, burn you!But not you, you can’t; you hain’t got the invention of a cockroach.But civil you can speak, and shall, George Merry, you may lay to that.”"
"“这话有道理。”老摩根说。","“That’s fair enow,” said the old man Morgan."
"“是有道理！我也这么认为。”船上的厨子说，“你丢了船，我找到了宝藏。究竟谁更有本事？妈的！现在我不干了！选出你们想选的船长，我受够了。”","“Fair!I reckon so,” said the sea-cook.“You lost the ship; I found the treasure.Who’s the better man at that?And now I resign, by thunder!Elect whom you please to be your cap’n now; I’m done with it.”"
"大家喊道：“西尔弗！大叉烧万岁！大叉烧当船长！”","“Silver!” they cried.“Barbecue forever!Barbecue for cap’n!”"
"厨子大喊道：“这就是你们的决定了，是吗？乔治，我看你得等下一轮再当船长了，朋友。算你走运，我不是个记仇的人。那从来不是我的做事方式。那么现在，伙计们，这个黑券怎么办？没用了，是吗？算迪克倒霉，毁了他的《圣经》，就为这么点事。”","“So that’s the toon, is it?” cried the cook.“George, I reckon you’ll have to wait another turn, friend; and lucky for you as I’m not a revengeful man.But that was never my way.And now, shipmates, this black spot?‘Tain’t much good now, is it?Dick’s crossed his luck and spoiled his Bible, and that’s about all.”"
"“以后亲吻这本《圣经》起誓还行吗？”迪克嘟哝着问，他显然为自己招来的诅咒而心神不安。","“It’ll do to kiss the book on still, won’t it?” growled Dick, who was evidently uneasy at the curse he had brought upon himself."
"西尔弗讥讽地问了一句：“用缺页的《圣经》宣誓？那可不行。那就像用歌词本起誓一样不算数。”","“A Bible with a bit cut out!” returned Silver derisively.“Not it.It don’t bind no more’n a ballad-book.”"
"迪克有点儿高兴地喊道，“不算数了？但是，我觉得那也值得留着它。”","“Don’t it, though?” cried Dick with a sort of joy.“Well, I reckon that’s worth having too.”"
"“给你，吉姆，让你瞧瞧。”西尔弗说着，把一小片纸扔给了我。","“Here, Jim—here’s a cur’osity for you,”said Silver, and he tossed me the paper."
"这是个硬币大小的圆纸片。因为纸片是《圣经》的最后一页，所以一面空白，另一面上印着《启示录》的最后几节，其中有一句在我脑海里留下了很深的印象：“外面有狗和杀人犯。”","It was around about the size of a crown piece.One side was blank, for it had been the last leaf; the other contained a verse or two of Revelation—these words among the rest, which struck sharply home upon my mind: “Without are dogs and murderers.”"
"印刷的一面被炭灰涂得漆黑，那炭灰开始往下掉，弄得我手指都黑了。空白的那一面用炭灰写着“下台”两个字。","The printed side had been blackened with wood ash, which already began to come off and soil my fingers; on the blank side had been written with the same material the one word “Depposed.”"
"这稀罕物至今仍在我手里，但上面的字迹已经没了，只剩下些像是用大拇指指甲划过后剩下的痕迹。","I have that curiosity beside me at this moment, but not a trace of writing now remains beyond a single scratch, such as a man might make with his thumb-nail."
"那一晚的事儿到此暂告一段落。没过多久，我们每人喝了一杯酒后躺下睡觉。西尔弗派乔治·梅里放哨作为报复，并且威胁他说，如果他不忠就处死他。","That was the end of the night’s business.Soon after, with a drink all round, we lay down to sleep, and the outside of Silver’s vengeance was to put George Merry up for sentinel and threaten him with death if he should prove unfaithful."
"我很久才能合上眼睛，天知道，我要想的事确实太多了。我在想下午最危险的时候杀死的那个人；最重要的是，我在想西尔弗的阴险手段——一方面，他把那些反叛者控制在手里；另一方面又想方设法地抓住任何机会，不管这些机会可能不可能，以求平安，保住自己可怜的小命。他自己睡得很香，鼾声震天，我的心里却有些难过，因为虽然他是个坏蛋，他最终却会是被送上绞架这样可耻的下场。","It was long ere I could close an eye, and heaven knows I had matter enough for thought in the man whom I had slain that afternoon, in my own most perilous position, and above all, in the remarkable game that I saw Silver now engaged upon—keeping the mutineers together with one hand and grasping with the other after every means, possible and impossible, to make his peace and save his miserable life.He himself slept peacefully and snored aloud, yet my heart was sore for him, wicked as he was, to think on the dark perils that environed and the shameful gibbet that awaited him."
"第三十章 宣誓后获释","Chapter 30 On Parole "
"我惊醒了——应该说我们大家都惊醒了——因为我看到就连靠在门柱上打盹的哨兵也猛地跳了过来。我们全都被树林边缘处清楚、强烈的声音惊醒了。那声音叫道：“喂！木屋里的人！”“医生来了。”","I was wakened—indeed, we were all wakened, for I could see even the sentinel shake himself together from where he had fallen against the door-post—by a clear, hearty voice hailing us from the margin of the wood: “Block house, ahoy!” it cried.“Here’s the doctor.”"
"第三十一章 寻宝——弗林特的指示","Chapter 31 The Treasure-hunt—Flint’s Pointer "
"等到只剩下我们俩时，西尔弗说：“吉姆，如果说我救了你的命，刚才你也救了我的命，我不会忘的。我用眼角的余光看到医生向你招手，叫你逃跑；我看见你说不行，就像我亲耳听到一样。吉姆，谢谢你！这是进攻失败后我看到的第一线希望，这全靠你。吉姆，我们现在要去寻宝了，不知前面会出现什么情况，我也没办法。你和我必须形影不离，互相支持，这样，即使我们命运不好，也能保住脑袋。”","“Jim,” said Silver when we were alone, “if I saved your life, you saved mine; and I’ll not forget it.I seen the doctor waving you to run for it—with the tail of my eye, I did; and I seen you say no, as plain as hearing.Jim, that’s one to you.This is the first glint of hope I had since the attack failed, and I owe it you.And now, Jim, we’re to go in for this here treasure-hunting, with sealed orders too, and I don’t like it; and you and me must stick close, back to back like, and we’ll save our necks in spite o’ fate and fortune.”"
"第三十二章 寻宝——树林中的声音","Chapter 32 The Treasure-hunt—The Voice Among the Trees   "
"部分人因为刚才吓到了，部分人为了让西尔弗和那个受伤的家伙休息一下，这伙人刚一爬上坡顶就都坐了下来。","Partly from the damping influence of this alarm, partly to rest Silver and the sick folk, the whole party sat down as soon as they had gained the brow of the ascent."
"这个坡顶有点向西斜，所以我们休息的地方左右两边视野都很开阔。越过我们前面的树梢，我们可以看到被海浪拍打的丛林海角；在我们身后，不仅可以俯瞰锚地和骷髅岛，而且可以看到穿过了沙尖角和东面低地那片一望无际的大海。我们头顶正上方耸立着望远镜山，山上面有几棵孤零零的松树，其它地方是黑黑的悬崖。周围一片寂静，只有远处从四面八方传来的海浪的拍击声和灌木丛中无数昆虫的叫声。一个人影也没有，海上也没有船帆，这空旷的景色更增添了一份孤独感。","The plateau being somewhat tilted towards the west, this spot on which we had paused commanded a wide prospect on either hand.Before us, over the tree-tops, we beheld the Cape of the Woods fringed with surf; behind, we not only looked down upon the anchorage and Skeleton Island, but saw—clear across the spit and the eastern lowlands—a great field of open sea upon the east.Sheer above us rose the Spyglass, here dotted with single pines, there black with precipices.There was no sound but that of the distant breakers, mounting from all round, and the chirp of countless insects in the brush.Not a man, not a sail, upon the sea; the very largeness of the view increased the sense of solitude."
"西尔弗坐下来，用罗盘测了几下方位。","Silver, as he sat, took certain bearings with his compass."
"他说：“有三棵‘高树’都在对着骷髅岛的这条直线上。‘望远镜山脊’，我估计就是那块低矮的地方。可见寻宝是件很容易的事儿。我想还是先吃饭再说吧。”","“There are three ‘tall trees’” said he, “about in the right line from Skeleton Island.‘Spy-glass shoulder,’ I take it, means that lower p’int there.It’s child’s play to find the stuff now.I’ve half a mind to dine first.”"
"摩根嘀咕道：“我不饿。想起弗林特，我就受不了。”","“I don’t feel sharp,” growled Morgan.“Thinkin’ o’ Flint—I think it were—as done me.”"
"“是啊，伙计，你得感谢老天爷他死了。” 西尔弗说。","“Ah, well, my son, you praise your stars he’s dead,” said Silver."
"另一个海盗打了个寒颤，大声说：“他是个丑恶的魔鬼，脸也是铁青铁青的！”","“He were an ugly devil,” cried a third pirate with a shudder; “that blue in the face too!”"
"梅里加了一句，“那是喝朗姆酒喝的。脸色铁青！对，我记得他的脸是青的。确实是。”","“That was how the rum took him,” added Merry.“Blue!Well, I reckon he was blue.That’s a true word.”"
"自从发现了那具骷髅骨，又想起这一系列的事儿，海盗们说话的声音越来越小，现在几乎变成了耳语，所以树林里还是一片寂静，没有受他们影响。突然，我们前面树林里响起了那支熟悉的调子，声音又尖又高，还有点发颤。“十五个人站在聚魂棺上——呦——嗬——嗬，还有一瓶朗姆酒！”","Ever since they had found the skeleton and got upon this train of thought, they had spoken lower and lower, and they had almost got to whispering by now, so that the sound of their talk hardly interrupted the silence of the wood.All of a sudden, out of the middle of the trees in front of us, a thin, high, trembling voice struck up the well-known air and words:  “Fifteen men on the dead man’s chest—Yo—ho—ho, and a bottle of rum!”"
"我从来没有见过有人像这些海盗那样被一支歌吓得要死。他们六个人像受了蛊惑一样面无血色，有的跳了起来，有的紧紧抓住别人，摩根趴在了地上。","I never have seen men more dreadfully affected than the pirates.The colour went from their six faces like enchantment; some leaped to their feet, some clawed hold of others; Morgan grovelled on the ground."
"“是弗林特，天——！”梅里大叫道。","“It’s Flint, by—!” cried Merry."
"歌声突然就停止了，就像开始一样突然，可以说就像唱到一半突然被人用手捂住了嘴。这歌声透过干净、明媚的阳光和绿绿的树林远远地传来，我觉得悠扬动听，所以觉得身边海盗的反应很奇怪。","The song had stopped as suddenly as it began—broken off, you would have said, in the middle of a note, as though someone had laid his hand upon the singer’s mouth.Coming through the clear, sunny atmosphere among the green tree-tops, I thought it had sounded airily and sweetly; and the effect on my companions was the stranger."
"西尔弗嘴唇都吓紫了，费了很大的劲儿才说：“走吧，呆在这也没有用。我们动身出发。这事儿真奇怪，我听不出那是谁的声音，但那唱歌的绝对是个有血有肉的大活人，这点我可以保证。”","“Come,” said Silver, struggling with his ashen lips to get the word out; “this won’t do.Stand by to go about.This is a rum start, and I can’t name the voice, but it’s someone skylarking—someone that’s flesh and blood, and you may lay to that.”"
"他说着说着胆子就大了些，脸上也恢复了一些血色。别的人听到这番鼓励也稍微稳下来了。这时那声音又响起来了，不是唱歌，而是远处虚无的呼喊声，在望远镜山中的回声更微弱。","His courage had come back as he spoke, and some of the colour to his face along with it.Already the others had begun to lend an ear to this encouragement and were coming a little to themselves, when the same voice broke out again—not this time singing, but in a faint distant hail that echoed yet fainter among the clefts of the Spy-glass."
"“达比·麦格劳。”那声音简直是在哀号。用哀号来形容这个声音是最确切不过了。达比·麦格劳！达比·麦格劳！那声音一遍又一遍地叫着，然后声音高了一点，大骂了一声（这句脏话我就不提了），喊道：“达比，拿朗姆酒来！”","“Darby M’Graw,” it wailed—for that is the word that best describes the sound—”Darby M’Graw!Darby M’Graw!”again and again and again; and then rising a little higher, and with an oath that I leave out: “Fetch aft the rum, Darby!”"
"海盗们脚就像钉在了地上，吓得眼珠子都快掉下来了。声音消失了好久以后，他们仍然万分惊恐地默默盯着前方。","The buccaneers remained rooted to the ground, their eyes starting from their heads.Long after the voice had died away they still stared in silence, dreadfully, before them."
"一个海盗倒抽了口气说道：“这回错不了！","“That fixes it!” gasped one."
"我们走。”","“Let’s go.”"
"摩根喃喃地说：“那是弗林特临死前说的最后一句话，确实是。”","“They was his last words,” moaned Morgan, “his last words above board.”"
"迪克拿出《圣经》，开始不停地祷告。迪克家教很好，出海之后才交上这帮狐朋狗友的。","Dick had his Bible out and was praying volubly.He had been well brought up, had Dick, before he came to sea and fell among bad companions."
"然而西尔弗并未被吓倒。我可以听到他的牙齿在咯咯作响，但他并没有屈服。","Still Silver was unconquered.I could hear his teeth rattle in his head, but he had not yet surrendered."
"他喃喃自语道：“这岛上没有人听说过达比，除了我们这几个。”   ","“Nobody in this here island ever heard of Darby,” he muttered; “not one but us that’s here.”"
"然后，他打起精神大喊着说：“伙计们，我来这儿是寻宝的，不管是人还是鬼，我都不会被打败。弗林特活着时我都不怕他，死了后就更不用怕了。离这儿不到四分之一英里的地方埋着七十万英镑的宝藏。什么时候见过海盗面对这么大一笔财富，却因为害怕某个喝多了酒、脸色发青的老水手而吓跑了呢？更何况他已经死了呢！”","And then, making a great effort: “Shipmates,” he cried, “I’m here to get that stuff, and I’ll not be beat by man or devil.I never was feared of Flint in his life, and, by the powers, I’ll face him dead.There’s seven hundred thousand pound not a quarter of a mile from here.When did ever a gentleman o’ fortune show his stern to that much dollars for a boozy old seaman with a blue mug—and him dead too?”"
"但是这不但没能恢复同伴们的勇气，反而因这不敬的态度增添了同伴们的恐惧心理。","But there was no sign of reawakening courage in his followers, rather, indeed, of growing terror at the irreverence of his words."
"梅里说道：“别说了，约翰！别跟鬼魂较劲。”","“Belay there, John!” said Merry.“Don’t you cross a sperrit.”"
"其他人吓得都说不出话来了。如果他们胆子够大的话，可能早就跑了，但恐惧使他们呆在一起，而且紧紧围在约翰身边，似乎这样能壮壮胆儿。至于西尔弗自己则成功地克服了自己的怯懦。","And the rest were all too terrified to reply.They would have run away severally had they dared; but fear kept them together, and kept them close by John, as if his daring helped them.He, on his part, had pretty well fought his weakness down."
"他说道：“鬼？也许吧。但有件事儿我还是不清楚。这声音有回音。大家都知道鬼魂没有影子，那么鬼叫怎么会有回音呢？我倒是很想知道。这不太正常，是不是？”"," “Sperrit? Well, maybe,” he said.“But there’s one thing not clear to me.There was an echo.Now, no man ever seen a sperrit with a shadow; well then, what’s he doing with an echo to him, I should like to know?That ain’t in natur’, surely?”"
"我觉得他这个话毫无道理。但你也说不清什么会影响迷信的人。让我惊讶的是，乔治·梅里居然大大地松了口气，好像相信了。","This argument seemed weak enough to me.But you can never tell what will affect the superstitious, and to my wonder, George Merry was greatly relieved."
"他说：“对，确实是这样。约翰，你那脑袋还真不是白长在肩上的。约翰，确实没错。走吧，伙计们！我想我们刚才都想错了。现在仔细想来，我承认那像弗林特的声音，只是很像，但毕竟不完全一样。更像是另一个人的声音，嗯，更像——”","“Well, that’s so,” he said.“You’ve a head upon your shoulders, John, and no mistake.‘Bout ship, mates!This here crew is on a wrong tack, I do believe.And come to think on it, it was like Flint’s voice, I grant you, but not just so clear—away like it, after all.It was liker somebody else’s voice now—it was liker—”"
"西尔弗大嚷道：“对了，更像本·冈恩！”","“By the powers, Ben Gunn!” roared Silver."
"趴在地上的摩根猛地用膝盖撑起身子叫道：“对，就是他。就是本·冈恩！”","“Aye, and so it were,” cried Morgan, springing on his knees.“Ben Gunn it were!”"
"迪克问道：“那也没什么区别，是不是？弗林特是个死人，本·冈恩也是死人啊。”","“It don’t make much odds, do it, now?” asked Dick.“Ben Gunn’s not here in the body any more’n Flint.”"
"但那些老水手们对他的说法嗤之以鼻。","But the older hands greeted this remark with scorn."
"梅里说：“谁也不在乎本·冈恩，他是死是活没人怕他。”","“Why, nobody minds Ben Gunn,” cried Merry; “dead or alive, nobody minds him.”"
"说来也怪，他们立刻恢复了精神，脸上也重新泛起了血色。不久，他们又闲聊起来，时不时地停下来听听，过一会儿没听到什么，就又重新扛起工具出发。梅里拿着西尔弗的指南针走在最前面，可以使前进的路线始终与骷髅岛保持在一条直线上。他说的倒是实话，不管是死是活，谁也不怕本·冈恩。","It was extraordinary how their spirits had returned and how the natural colour had revived in their faces.Soon they were chatting together, with intervals of listening; and not long after, hearing no further sound, they shouldered the tools and set forth again, Merry walking first with Silver’s compass to keep them on the right line with Skeleton Island.He had said the truth: dead or alive, nobody minded Ben Gunn."
"只有迪克还拿着《圣经》，边走边害怕地张望。不过没人同情他，西尔弗甚至还取笑他疑神疑鬼。","Dick alone still held his Bible, and looked around him as he went, with fearful glances; but he found no sympathy, and Silver even joked him on his precautions."
"他说：“我告诉过你了吧。我跟你说过你把《圣经》弄坏了。连你用它祷告都没有用，你认为鬼会怕它吗？不管用！”","“I told you,” said he—“I told you you had sp’iled your Bible.If it ain’t no good to swear by, what do you suppose a sperrit would give for it?Not that!”"
"说到这儿，他用粗大的手指打了个响指，拄着拐杖停了下来。","and he snapped his big fingers, halting a moment on his crutch."
"但迪克确实还是不舒服，因为我很快就发现这小伙子病了；酷热、疲惫，再加上刚才的惊吓，利夫西医生预言的热病显然正急速加剧。","But Dick was not to be comforted; indeed, it was soon plain to me that the lad was falling sick; hastened by heat, exhaustion, and the shock of his alarm, the fever, predicted by Dr.  Livesey, was evidently growing swiftly higher."
"山顶上很开阔，走起来很容易。我在前面已经说过，高地朝西倾斜，我们走的是个小下坡路。大大小小的松树相距较远，甚至在一丛丛的肉豆蔻和杜鹃花之间，也有不少开阔的地方暴晒在炙热的阳光下。我们正朝西北方向横穿全岛，所以一方面离望远镜山的山脊越来越近，另一方面也越来越清楚地看到西海湾，就是我曾经坐着颠簸晃荡的小船经过的地方。","It was fine open walking here, upon the summit; our way lay a little downhill, for, as I have said, the plateau tilted towards the west.The pines, great and small, grew wide apart; and even between the clumps of nutmeg and azalea, wide open spaces baked in the hot sunshine.Striking, as we did, pretty near north-west across the island, we drew, on the one hand, ever nearer under the shoulders of the Spy-glass, and on the other, looked ever wider over that western bay where I had once tossed and trembled in the oracle."
"我们来到了第一棵大树前，但测了几下，表明这不是。第二棵也不是。第三棵树耸立在一片矮灌木丛中，差不多有两百英尺高，这是植物中的巨人，红色的树干有一间小屋那么大，宽大的树阴容得下一个连操练。从东西两岸都能很容易看到这棵树，完全可以作为航标画在地图上。","The first of the tall trees was reached, and by the bearings proved the wrong one.So with the second.The third rose nearly two hundred feet into the air above a clump of underwood—a giant of a vegetable, with a red column as big as a cottage, and a wide shadow around in which a company could have manoeuvred.It was conspicuous far to see both on the east and west and might have been entered as a sailing mark upon the chart."
"不过，他们感兴趣的不是这棵树有多高大，而是他们确信在树阴下某个地方埋着七十万镑的金银财宝。他们离那儿越来越近，先前的恐惧也就被发财的念头吞噬了。他们眼睛都冒着光，脚步也越来越轻快，整个心思全在这财宝上，想着这辈子以后享尽荣华富贵，想着这一切就在那儿等着他们。","But it was not its size that now impressed my companions; it was the knowledge that seven hundred thousand pounds in gold lay somewhere buried below its spreading shadow.The thought of the money, as they drew nearer, swallowed up their previous terrors.Their eyes burned in their heads; their feet grew speedier and lighter; their whole soul was found up in that fortune, that whole lifetime of extravagance and pleasure, that lay waiting there for each of them."
"西尔弗拄着拐杖一瘸一拐地走着，嘴里嘟囔着，鼻孔张着，不停地翕动。当苍蝇叮在他那激动得发亮的脸上，他像疯子一样破口大骂。他恶狠狠地拽过拴着我的绳子，并时不时凶狠地瞪着我。显然，他已经不再费力地掩饰自己的想法，我看得一清二楚。看到财宝近在眼前，其它的一切他都忘了，他的承诺和医生的警告早已成了遥远的过去。我毫不怀疑他希望能将财宝搞到手，趁天黑找到伊斯帕尼奥拉号，装上财宝，然后杀掉岛上每个正派人，然后像他最初打算的那样，满载罪恶和财宝出海。","Silver hobbled, grunting, on his crutch; his nostrils stood out and quivered; he cursed like a madman when the flies settled on his hot and shiny countenance; he plucked furiously at the line that held me to him and from time to time turned his eyes upon me with a deadly look.Certainly he took no pains to hide his thoughts, and certainly I read them like print.In the immediate nearness of the gold, all else had been forgotten: his promise and the doctor’s warning were both things of the past, and I could not doubt that he hoped to seize upon the treasure, find and board the HISPANIOLA under cover of night, cut every honest throat about that island, and sail away as he had at first intended, laden with crimes and riches."
"我想到这里吓得浑身发抖，很难跟上那些寻宝者们飞快的步伐。我不时跌跌撞撞，这时，西尔弗就会粗暴地拽绳子，并且恶狠狠地瞪着我。跟在我们身后的迪克，一会儿骂几句，一会儿祷告几句，但发烧还是越来越厉害。这更使我痛苦。我脑海里萦绕着过去这片高地上发生的幕幕惨剧。那个邪恶的青脸海盗（他后来死在萨凡纳，死的时候还唱着嚷着要喝酒），就在此地，亲手将自己的六个同伴杀死。当时充斥着惨叫声的树林现在倒是一片寂静。但一想到过去，我就觉得自己又听到了那惨叫声在回响。","Shaken as I was with these alarms, it was hard for me to keep up with the rapid pace of the treasure-hunters.Now and again I stumbled, and it was then that Silver plucked so roughly at the rope and launched at me his murderous glances.Dick, who had dropped behind us and now brought up the rear, was babbling to himself both prayers and curses as his fever kept rising.This also added to my wretchedness, and to crown all, I was haunted by the thought of the tragedy that had once been acted on that plateau, when that ungodly buccaneer with the blue face—he who died at Savannah, singing and shouting for drink—had there, with his own hand, cut down his six accomplices.This grove that was now so peaceful must then have rung with cries, I thought; and even with the thought I could believe I heard it ringing still."
"我们现在已经来到了丛林的边缘。","We were now at the margin of the thicket."
"“快点，伙计们，快过来！”梅里大声喊道，走在最前面的人跑了过去。","“Huzza, mates, all together!” shouted Merry; and the foremost broke into a run."
"突然，我们看到他们跑了不到十码远就停下了。他们发出低沉的惊呼。西尔弗像有鬼附身一样，拄着拐杖加速奔上前去。紧接着，我和他也停住了脚步。","And suddenly, not ten yards further, we beheld them stop.A low cry arose.Silver doubled his pace, digging away with the foot of his crutch like one possessed; and next moment he and I had come also to a dead halt."
"我们面前是一个大坑，不像最近新挖的，因为坑边已经塌下去，坑底也已经长出了青草。坑里有一把断成两截的镐柄，周围还扔着一些包装箱的破木板。我看到其中一块板子上用烙铁烫出的字样，写着“海象”——这正是弗林特的船名。","Before us was a great excavation, not very recent, for the sides had fallen in and grass had sprouted on the bottom.In this were the shaft of a pick broken in two and the boards of several packing-cases strewn around.On one of these boards I saw, branded with a hot iron, the name WALRUS—the name of Flint’s ship."
"一切都再清楚不过了。有人已经发现了宝藏，并洗劫一空，七十万镑的财宝全都不见了！","All was clear to probation.The CACHE had been found and rifled; the seven hundred thousand pounds were gone!"
"第三十三章 西尔弗的垮台","Chapter 33 The Fall of a Chieftain"
"世界上再也没有比这更让人失望的了。在这儿的六个人每个都像被重击了一样。但是西尔弗很快就从这个打击中恢复过来了。刚才他全部心思就是全力向宝藏冲刺，就像接力赛选手一样，可转瞬间他就发现一切都完了。不过他仍保持头脑冷静，控制好自己，在别人意识到一切都完了之前就已经改变了自己的计划。","There never was such an overturn in this world.Each of these six men was as though he had been struck.But with Silver the blow passed almost instantly.Every thought of his soul had been set full-stretch, like a racer, on that money; well, he was brought up, in a single second, dead; and he kept his head, found his temper, and changed his plan before the others had had time to realize the disappointment."
"第三十四章 结尾","Chapter 34 And Last   "
"第二天大早上，我们就开始工作，因为要把这么一大堆财宝从陆地搬到海边，大概得走一英里，再坐小船航行三英里把财宝才能运到伊斯帕尼奥拉号上去。这工作对我们这么少的劳力来说实在很艰巨。我们并不担心在岛上的那三个家伙，只要派一个人在山脊上放哨就能确保我们不会遭到他们的突然袭击。再说，我们认为他们也已经尝够了打杀的滋味。","The next morning we fell early to work, for the transportation of this great mass of gold near a mile by land to the beach, and thence three miles by boat to the HISPANIOLA, was a considerable task for so small a number of workmen.The three fellows still abroad upon the island did not greatly trouble us; a single sentry on the shoulder of the hill was sufficient to ensure us against any sudden onslaught, and we thought, besides, they had had more than enough of fighting."
