"作者：埃德加·爱伦·坡","by Edgar Allan Poe"
"我从没听说有谁比国王更热衷于笑话。他似乎就是为了笑话而活着。能够讲一个好笑的故事，而且讲得有声有色，就一定会得到他的宠幸。因此十分碰巧，他的七位大臣全都是因说笑话的才能而闻名于世的。他们也都像国王一样，个个都是身材高大、体形肥胖、满面油光的人物，而且还是无与伦比的说笑能手。人是因为开玩笑而变胖，还是因为肥胖本身蕴藏着笑话，我无从得知。但可以肯定的是，一个会开玩笑的瘦子在世间一定是个稀罕物。","I  never knew anyone so keenly alive to a joke as the king was.He seemed to live only for joking.To tell a good story of the joke kind, and to tell it well, was the surest road to his favor.Thus it happened that his seven ministers were all noted for their accomplishments as jokers.They all took after the king, too, in being large, corpulent, oily men, as well as inimitable jokers.Whether people grow fat by joking, or whether there is something in fat itself which predisposes to a joke, I have never been quite able to determine; but certain it is that a lean joker is a rara avis in terris."
"关于风雅，或者正如他所谓的“鬼”聪明，国王很少在这上面花费功夫。他特别欣赏笑话的广度（“庸俗”），之所以能够忍受它的长度，就是因为这个缘故。过度的文雅反而使他厌倦。他更喜欢拉伯雷笔下的“卡冈都亚”而不喜欢伏尔泰笔下的“查第格”。总而言之，恶作剧远比文字玩笑更合他的胃口。","About the refinements, or, as he called them, the ‘ghost’ of wit, the king troubled himself very little.He had an especial admiration for breadth in a jest, and would often put up with length, for the sake of it.Over-niceties wearied him.He would have preferred Rabelais’ ‘Gargantua’ to the ‘Zadig’ of Voltaire: and, upon the whole, practical jokes suited his taste far better than verbal ones."
"在我所叙述的年代，职业小丑在宫廷中还没有完全过时。欧洲大陆的几个“强国”仍然保留着他们的“弄臣”，他们穿着五颜六色的衣服，戴着帽子，系着铃铛。人们期望他们在极短的时间内，随时准备好巧妙的玩笑，来答谢从御桌上掉下来的面包渣。","At the date of my narrative, professing jesters had not altogether gone out of fashion at court.Several of the great continental ‘powers’ still retain their ‘fools,’ who wore motley, with caps and bells, and who were expected to be always ready with sharp witticisms, at a moment’s notice, in consideration of the crumbs that fell from the royal table."
"我们的国王，理所当然保留着他的“弄臣”。事实是，他需要一些愚蠢的东西——仅仅是为了与他七位大臣的智慧保持平衡——就更不用提他自己了。","Our king, as a matter of course, retained his ‘fool.’The fact is, he required something in the way of folly—if only to counterbalance the heavy wisdom of the seven wise men who were his ministers—not to mention himself."
"尽管如此，他的弄臣或者说是职业小丑，并不仅仅是个弄臣。在国王眼里，他值三倍的价，因为他不仅是个矮子，还是个跛子。在当时的宫廷里，矮子和弄臣一样常见。很多君王要是没有个弄臣和他们一起笑，没有个矮子让他们取笑，就会觉得难以度日（在宫廷的日子要比在其他地方漫长得多）。但是，正如我已经观察到的那样，在君王的小丑中，一百个里有九十九个是胖乎乎、圆滚滚、笨手笨脚的——因此我们的国王对于得到了跳蛙（一个小丑的名字）很是欣喜，因为他一个顶三个。","His fool, or professional jester, was not only a fool, however.His value was trebled in the eyes of the king, by the fact of his being also a dwarf and a cripple.Dwarfs were as common at court, in those days, as fools; and many monarchs would have found it difficult to get through their days (days are rather longer at court than elsewhere) without both a jester to laugh with, and a dwarf to laugh at.But, as I have already observed, your jesters, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, are fat, round, and unwieldy—so that it was no small source of self-gratulation with our king that, in Hop-Frog (this was the fool’s name), he possessed a triplicate treasure in one person."
"我相信“跳蛙”这个名字不是他的教父母在洗礼仪式上给他取的，而是几位大臣一致同意赐予他的，因为他无法像其他人那样走路。事实上，跳蛙只能用一种穿插式的步态行进——介于跳动和扭动之间——这个动作给国王带来了无穷的乐趣，当然也有安慰。因为国王（尽管他挺着个肚子，顶着与生俱来的肥硕脑袋）在整个宫廷都堪称是绝佳的形象。","I believe the name ‘Hop-Frog’ was not that given to the dwarf by his sponsors at baptism, but it was conferred upon him, by general consent of the several ministers, on account of his inability to walk as other men do.In fact, Hop-Frog could only get along by a sort of interjectional gait—something between a leap and a wriggle—a movement that afforded illimitable amusement, and of course consolation, to the king, for (notwithstanding the protuberance of his stomach and a constitutional swelling of the head) the king, by his whole court, was accounted a capital figure."
"然而，尽管跳蛙双腿扭曲，在路上或者地板上行走需要承受很大的痛苦和艰辛，但是似乎大自然赋予他的手臂肌肉惊人的力量，就是为了弥补他下肢的缺陷，使他能够表演许多精彩且动作敏捷的特技。他可以在树上、绳子上，或者其他一些东西上攀爬。做这样的动作时，他更像是一只松鼠，或者是一只小猴子，而不像是只青蛙。","But although Hop-Frog, through the distortion of his legs, could move only with great pain and difficulty along a road or floor, the prodigious muscular power which nature seemed to have bestowed upon his arms, by way of compensation for deficiency in the lower limbs, enabled him to perform many feats of wonderful dexterity, where trees or ropes were in question, or any thing else to climb.At such exercises he certainly much more resembled a squirrel, or a small monkey, than a frog."
"我不能准确地说出跳蛙最初来自于哪个地方。尽管如此，他应该是来自于某个野蛮、甚至没有人听说过的地区——一个离我们国王的宫廷十分遥远的地方。跳蛙，和一个比他稍高一点的年轻姑娘（尽管她身材娇好、比例匀称，而且还是个出色的舞者）都是在比邻的省份他们各自的家乡被一位常胜将军强行带过来，当作礼物送给国王的。","I am not able to say, with precision, from what country Hop-Frog originally came.It was from some barbarous region, however, that no person ever heard of—a vast distance from the court of our king.Hop-Frog, and a young girl very little less dwarfish than himself (although of exquisite proportions, and a marvellous dancer), had been forcibly carried off from their respective homes in adjoining provinces, and sent as presents to the king, by one of his ever-victorious generals."
"在这些情况下，就不难理解这两个矮小的俘虏之间的亲密关系了。确实，他们很快就变成了心腹之交。尽管跳蛙能耍许多把戏，但要是没能为特里佩塔效劳的话，就根本不会受欢迎。而她，因为优雅的举止和美丽的面容（尽管是个矮子），受到了大众广泛的赞美和宠爱，因此她拥有很大的影响力。而且只要她能够做到，无论在任何时候她一定会利用这种影响力来为跳蛙谋求利益。","Under these circumstances, it is not to be wondered at that a close intimacy arose between the two little captives.Indeed, they soon became sworn friends.Hop-Frog, who, although he made a great deal of sport, was by no means popular, had it not in his power to render Trippetta many services; but she, on account of her grace and exquisite beauty (although a dwarf), was universally admired and petted; so she possessed much influence; and never failed to use it, whenever she could, for the benefit of Hop-Frog."
"在一次盛大的国家性的活动场合——我忘记是什么了——国王决定举办一场化装舞会。每当我们宫廷里有化装舞会或者诸如此类的活动时，那些人才，包括跳蛙和特里佩塔两个人肯定会被招去表演。尤其是跳蛙，在组织盛会、编排新颖的角色、安排舞会服装方面都很有创造力。一个化装舞会，似乎要是没有他的协助，就什么事也做不成。","On some grand state occasion—I forgot what—the king determined to have a masquerade, and whenever a masquerade or any thing of that kind, occurred at our court, then the talents, both of Hop-Frog and Trippetta were sure to be called into play.Hop-Frog, in especial, was so inventive in the way of getting up pageants, suggesting novel characters, and arranging costumes, for masked balls, that nothing could be done, it seems, without his assistance."
"举行舞会的那晚来临了。一座金碧辉煌的大厅已经在特里佩塔的监督之下布置好了，一切可能给化装舞会增添光彩的设施都用上了。整个宫廷的人都在热切地期盼着。至于服装和角色，不难想象，每个人都已经拿定了主意。一星期，甚至是一个月以前，很多人就已经拿定主意了（确定了要扮演什么角色）。事实上，根本没有人犹豫不决——除了国王和他的七位大臣。我始终不知道他们为什么犹豫，除非他们是在开玩笑。很有可能是因为身体过于肥胖，所以他们才觉得很难做出决定。无论如何，时间过得很快，他们用了最后一招，派人去召唤特里佩塔和跳蛙。","The night appointed for the fete had arrived.A gorgeous hall had been fitted up, under Trippetta’s eye, with every kind of device which could possibly give eclat to a masquerade.The whole court was in a fever of expectation.As for costumes and characters, it might well be supposed that everybody had come to a decision on such points.Many had made up their minds (as to what roles they should assume) a week, or even a month, in advance; and, in fact, there was not a particle of indecision anywhere—except in the case of the king and his seven ministers.Why they hesitated I never could tell, unless they did it by way of a joke.More probably, they found it difficult, on account of being so fat, to make up their minds.At all events, time flew; and, as a last resort they sent for Trippetta and Hop-Frog."
"当这两个小伙伴听从国王的召唤到来时，发现他正和七位内阁大臣坐在酒席上，但是这位君王却显得心情不太好。他知道跳蛙不喜欢喝酒，因为酒会使这个可怜的跛子兴奋得几乎疯狂，疯狂的感觉可不舒服。但是国王就是喜欢恶作剧，并以强迫跳蛙喝酒为乐（用国王的话说是）“作乐”。","When the two little friends obeyed the summons of the king they found him sitting at his wine with the seven members of his cabinet council; but the monarch appeared to be in a very ill humor.He knew that Hop-Frog was not fond of wine, for it excited the poor cripple almost to madness; and madness is no comfortable feeling.But the king loved his practical jokes, and took pleasure in forcing Hop-Frog to drink and (as the king called it) ‘to be merry.’"
"“到这儿来，跳蛙，”当这个小丑和他的伙伴一进房间时，国王说，“为了你那些不在场朋友的健康干了这杯酒，（这时跳蛙叹了一口气）然后就让我们来分享一下你独创的点子吧。我们需要角色——角色，小子——一些新颖的——不同寻常的角色。我们已经厌倦那些老一套的戏法了。来吧，喝了！酒能让你的聪明才智得以发挥。”","“Come here, Hop-Frog,” said he, as the jester and his friend entered the room; “swallow this bumper to the health of your absent friends, (here Hop-Frog sighed,) and then let us have the benefit of your invention.We want characters—characters, man—something novel—out of the way.We are wearied with this everlasting sameness.Come, drink! the wine will brighten your wits.”"
"跳蛙像平时一样，努力地寻找笑话来答谢国王，但是却努力过了头。这天恰好是这位可怜矮子的生日，让他为“不在场的朋友”干杯的命令，使他的眼睛里泛起了泪花。他谦恭地从那位暴君的手中接过酒杯，苦涩的泪珠大颗大颗地滴落在酒杯里。","Hop-Frog endeavored, as usual, to get up a jest in reply to these advances from the king; but the effort was too much.It happened to be the poor dwarf’s birthday, and the command to drink to his ‘absent friends’ forced the tears to his eyes.Many large, bitter drops fell into the goblet as he took it, humbly, from the hand of the tyrant."
"“啊！哈！哈！”当矮子不情愿地喝光那杯酒后，国王咆哮起来——“看看一杯好酒的力量有多大！哎呦，你的眼睛已经闪闪发亮了！”","“Ah! ha! ha!” roared the latter, as the dwarf reluctantly drained the beaker.—“See what a glass of good wine can do!Why, your eyes are shining already!”"
"可怜的家伙！他的大眼睛是在闪烁，而不是发亮。因为酒对他那容易兴奋的大脑立即起了作用。他紧张不安地把酒杯放到桌子上，用近乎疯狂的目光环视了一下这群人。他们似乎都被国王的“玩笑”逗得哈哈大笑了。","Poor fellow! his large eyes gleamed, rather than shone; for the effect of wine on his excitable brain was not more powerful than instantaneous.He placed the goblet nervously on the table, and looked round upon the company with a half-insane stare.They all seemed highly amused at the success of the king’s ‘joke.’"
"“那么现在来办正经事吧。”一个大胖子首相说。","“And now to business,” said the prime minister, a very fat man."
"“对，”国王说，“过来帮帮我们。角色，我的好伙计，我们迫切地需要角色——我们所有人——哈！哈！哈！”国王有意把这句话说成一个笑话，他的七位大臣就纷纷应和地笑了起来。","“Yes,” said the King; “Come lend us your assistance.Characters, my fine fellow; we stand in need of characters—all of us—ha! ha! ha!” and as this was seriously meant for a joke, his laugh was chorused by the seven."
"跳蛙也哈哈大笑起来，尽管笑得无力还有些茫然。","Hop-Frog also laughed although feebly and somewhat vacantly."
"“来吧，来吧，”国王不耐烦地说，“你难道就没有什么好的提议吗？”","“Come, come,” said the king, impatiently, “have you nothing to suggest?”"
"“我正在努力地想一些新奇的东西。”矮子心不在焉地回答道，因为他已经被酒给弄得晕乎乎的了。","“I am endeavoring to think of something novel,” replied the dwarf, abstractedly, for he was quite bewildered by the wine."
"“正在努力！”暴君狂叫道，“你这话是什么意思？啊，我明白了。你还在生闷气，而且还想再喝点酒。这儿呢，喝吧！”他又倒了满满的一杯酒，递给了这个跛子，跛子只是盯着它，大口喘着气。","“Endeavoring!” cried the tyrant, fiercely; “what do you mean by that?Ah, I perceive.You are Sulky, and want more wine.Here, drink this!” and he poured out another goblet full and offered it to the cripple, who merely gazed at it, gasping for breath."
"“喝呀，我说！”那个魔王大喊道，“否则就见鬼去——”","“Drink, I say!” shouted the monster, “or by the fiends—”"
"这个矮子犹豫不决。国王被气得脸色发紫。大臣们都在窃笑。特里佩塔脸色苍白得像个僵尸，向国王的宝座走去，她跪在了他的面前，乞求国王宽恕她的朋友。","The dwarf hesitated.The king grew purple with rage.The courtiers smirked.Trippetta, pale as a corpse, advanced to the monarch’s seat, and, falling on her knees before him, implored him to spare her friend."
"暴君盯着她，看了好一会儿，显然对她大胆的举动感到十分吃惊。他好像是完全不知所措了，不知道该做什么或者该说什么了——不知道该如何恰当地表达他自己的愤怒了。最后，他一个字也没说，只是狠狠地将她推开，然后把满满的一大杯酒泼到了她的脸上。","The tyrant regarded her, for some moments, in evident wonder at her audacity.He seemed quite at a loss what to do or say—how most becomingly to express his indignation.At last, without uttering a syllable, he pushed her violently from him, and threw the contents of the brimming goblet in her face."
"可怜的姑娘吃力地爬起来，甚至不敢叹气，就又退回到桌脚旁。","The poor girl got up the best she could, and, not daring even to sigh, resumed her position at the foot of the table."
"一时间静寂无声，大概持续了半分钟之久，其间就连一片叶子或者一根羽毛掉落下来的声音都能够听得见。这种寂静突然被一阵低沉、但很刺耳、拖沓的摩擦声打破，仿佛是从房间的每个角落一齐传出来的。","There was a dead silence for about half a minute, during which the falling of a leaf, or of a feather, might have been heard.It was interrupted by a low, but harsh and protracted grating sound which seemed to come at once from every corner of the room."
"“什么——什么——你制造这种噪音干什么？”国王愤怒地转过身质问矮子。","“What—what—what are you making that noise for?” demanded the king, turning furiously to the dwarf."
"矮子似乎已经基本从酒醉中恢复过来了，他静静地盯着暴君的脸，只是突然冒出一句：","The latter seemed to have recovered, in great measure, from his intoxication, and looking fixedly but quietly into the tyrant’s face, merely ejaculated:"
"“我——我？怎么可能是我呢？”","“I—I? How could it have been me?”"
"“这个声音好像是从外面传过来的，”其中一位大臣说道，“我想是窗户边上的鹦鹉在笼子的铁架上磨喙呢。”","“The sound appeared to come from without,” observed one of the courtiers.“I fancy it was the parrot at the window, whetting his bill upon his cage-wires.”"
"“没错，”君王回答说，听到这个说法似乎让他放下心来，“但是，我可以用一个骑士的名誉发誓，一定是这个无赖在咬牙。”","“True,” replied the monarch, as if much relieved by the suggestion; “but, on the honor of a knight, I could have sworn that it was the gritting of this vagabond’s teeth.”"
"随即这个矮子大笑起来（国王是个不折不扣的玩笑家，以至于不会反对任何人笑），露出一排大而有力、令人厌恶的牙齿。另外，他还发誓说国王要他喝多少酒他就愿意喝多少酒。君王这才消了气。跳蛙又喝了一大杯，但却没觉察到有什么不良的反应，随即神采奕奕地说起化装舞会的计划。","Hereupon the dwarf laughed (the king was too confirmed a joker to object to any one’s laughing), and displayed a set of large, powerful, and very repulsive teeth.Moreover, he avowed his perfect willingness to swallow as much wine as desired.The monarch was pacified; and having drained another bumper with no very perceptible ill effect, Hop-Frog entered at once, and with spirit, into the plans for the masquerade."
"“我说不出是怎么想到这个主意的，”他十分平静地说道，好像他这一辈子从没碰过酒似的，“但是就在陛下打了那个姑娘，把酒泼到她的脸上之后——就在陛下这样做了之后，还有正当窗外那只鹦鹉制造那奇怪的噪音之时，我突然灵机一动——是我家乡的一种把戏——我们在化装舞会上经常这样玩，但是在这儿可完全是个新花样。可惜，无论如何也需要八个人，而且——”","“I cannot tell what was the association of idea,” observed he, very tranquilly, and as if he had never tasted wine in his life, “but just after your majesty, had struck the girl and thrown the wine in her face—just after your majesty had done this, and while the parrot was making that odd noise outside the window, there came into my mind a capital diversion—one of my own country frolics—often enacted among us, at our masquerades: but here it will be new altogether.Unfortunately, however, it requires a company of eight persons and—”"
"“我们就是啊！”国王叫道，他为自己如此敏锐地发现了这个巧合而得意地笑了起来，“正好是八个人——我和我的七位大臣。来吧！怎么个玩法？”","“Here we are!” cried the king, laughing at his acute discovery of the coincidence; “eight to a fraction—I and my seven ministers.Come! what is the diversion?”"
"“我们把它叫做，”跛子回答道，“八只戴铁链的猩猩，如果扮演得好，一定非常精彩。”","“We call it,” replied the cripple, “the Eight Chained Ourang-Outangs, and it really is excellent sport if well enacted.”"
"“我们就玩这个游戏了。”国王评论道，随即挺直了身子，垂下眼帘。","“We will enact it,” remarked the king, drawing himself up, and lowering his eyelids."
"“这个游戏的妙处，”跳蛙继续说，“在于它可以把女人吓得要死。”","“The beauty of the game,” continued Hop-Frog, “lies in the fright it occasions among the women.”"
"“太好了！”君王和他的大臣们异口同声地吼道。","“Capital!” roared in chorus the monarch and his ministry."
"“我将会把你们打扮成猩猩，”矮子继续说道，“一切就都交给我来办吧。扮相会和猩猩惊人地相似，参加化装舞会的所有人都会把你们当作真的野兽——当然了，他们将会十分吃惊、非常害怕。”","“I will equip you as ourang-outangs,” proceeded the dwarf; “leave all that to me.The resemblance shall be so striking, that the company of masqueraders will take you for real beasts—and of course, they will be as much terrified as astonished.”"
"“噢，这太棒了！”国王惊叹道，“跳蛙！我一定会提拔你的。”","“Oh, this is exquisite!” exclaimed the king.“Hop-Frog! I will make a man of you.”"
"“用铁链的目的是通过它刺耳的声音来加剧混乱的效果。你们要假装是刚从看守者那里集体逃出来的。陛下您是无法想象所产生的效果的，化装舞会上，在多数旁观者眼中，八只猩猩戴着铁链野蛮地嚎叫着冲进来，穿梭在一群衣着精美、华丽的男男女女中间。这是多么绝妙的对比啊！”","“The chains are for the purpose of increasing the confusion by their jangling.You are supposed to have escaped, en masse, from your keepers.Your majesty cannot conceive the effect produced, at a masquerade, by eight chained ourang-outangs, imagined to be real ones by most of the company; and rushing in with savage cries, among the crowd of delicately and gorgeously habited men and women.The contrast is inimitable!”"
"“一定会是这样的。”国王说。大臣们匆忙地站起身来（天色渐渐晚了），去实施跳蛙的计划了。","“It must be,” said the king: and the council arose hurriedly (as it was growing late), to put in execution the scheme of Hop-Frog."
"他把国王一伙人打扮成猩猩的办法很简单，但是足以有效地达到他的目的了。在我讲的故事所发生的年代，我们所谈论的这种动物在文明世界的任何地方都十分少见。再加上被矮子所打扮出来的人和真正的野兽十分相像，甚至是更加可怕，因此人们绝对会信以为真。","His mode of equipping the party as ourang-outangs was very simple, but effective enough for his purposes.The animals in question had, at the epoch of my story, very rarely been seen in any part of the civilized world; and as the imitations made by the dwarf were sufficiently beast-like and more than sufficiently hideous, their truthfulness to nature was thus thought to be secured."
"国王和他的七位大臣首先被套上了紧身的针织衬衣衬裤。然后他们身上浸满了柏油。进行到这步时，这伙人中有人提议用羽毛，但却立刻被矮子给否决了。这八个人很快就被亲眼目睹的事实说服了，像猩猩这种野兽的毛用亚麻来代替，效果是最好的。于是又在柏油的表面粘上了一层厚厚的亚麻。接着，一条长长的铁链子也准备好了。首先，铁链绕到国王的腰上系好，接着再绕过另一个人，也系好；然后依次把所有人都用相同的办法系起来。当铁链系好之后，这些人彼此拉开最大的距离站好，他们形成了一个圆圈。为了使所有的东西看起来更加逼真，跳蛙沿着两条互相垂直的直径把剩下的铁链穿过圆圈，就跟现在婆罗洲人捕捉黑猩猩或其他猩猩的做法一样。","The king and his ministers were first encased in tight-fitting stockinet shirts and drawers.They were then saturated with tar.At this stage of the process, some one of the party suggested feathers; but the suggestion was at once overruled by the dwarf, who soon convinced the eight, by ocular demonstration, that the hair of such a brute as the ourang-outang was much more efficiently represented by flax.A thick coating of the latter was accordingly plastered upon the coating of tar.A long chain was now procured.First, it was passed about the waist of the king, and tied, then about another of the party, and also tied; then about all successively, in the same manner.When this chaining arrangement was complete, and the party stood as far apart from each other as possible, they formed a circle; and to make all things appear natural, Hop-Frog passed the residue of the chain in two diameters, at right angles, across the circle, after the fashion adopted, at the present day, by those who capture Chimpanzees, or other large apes, in Borneo."
"举行化装舞会的地方是一座宏伟的圆形大厅，非常高，只有屋顶的一扇窗能够透进阳光。到了晚上（这个建筑就是专为这个时候设计的），它主要是依靠一盏巨大的枝形吊灯照明。吊灯是由从天窗中央垂下来的铁链吊着的，通常是利用一个平衡装置进行升降，但是（为了不影响美观）这个装置被安置在穹顶之外，屋顶的上方。","The grand saloon in which the masquerade was to take place, was a circular room, very lofty, and receiving the light of the sun only through a single window at top.At night (the season for which the apartment was especially designed) it was illuminated principally by a large chandelier, depending by a chain from the centre of the sky-light, and lowered, or elevated, by means of a counter-balance as usual; but (in order not to look unsightly) this latter passed outside the cupola and over the roof."
"厅内的布置是在特里佩塔的监督之下进行的。但是，在某些细节上，她似乎还是要接受她那矮子朋友更加冷静的判断和指导。按照他的建议，为顺应这种场合，那个枝形吊灯被拆除了。因为它的烛泪（在这么炎热的天气下是不可避免的）会严重损坏宾客们的华丽服装。由于他们都挤在大厅里，很难指望他们远离大厅的中央，也就是说，远离吊灯的下方。额外的一些烛台被放置在大厅许多不挡道的地方，每个靠墙的女像石柱的右手上都放置着一个散发着芳香的火把——一共有五六十个。","The arrangements of the room had been left to Trippetta’s superintendence; but, in some particulars, it seems, she had been guided by the calmer judgment of her friend the dwarf.At his suggestion it was that, on this occasion, the chandelier was removed.Its waxen drippings (which, in weather so warm, it was quite impossible to prevent) would have been seriously detrimental to the rich dresses of the guests, who, on account of the crowded state of the saloon, could not all be expected to keep from out its centre; that is to say, from under the chandelier.Additional sconces were set in various parts of the hall, out of the way, and a flambeau, emitting sweet odor, was placed in the right hand of each of the Caryatides that stood against the wall—some fifty or sixty altogether."
"这八只猩猩听取了跳蛙的建议，耐心地守候着，午夜十二点（那时大厅全部挤满了参加化装舞会的人）到来之前一直都没有露面。然而午夜钟声刚一停，他们就一起冲了进去，更确切地说是滚了进去——因为铁链的羁绊，他们中的大多数人都被绊倒了，因此所有人进去的时候都是踉踉跄跄的。","The eight ourang-outangs, taking Hop-Frog’s advice, waited patiently until midnight (when the room was thoroughly filled with masqueraders) before making their appearance.No sooner had the clock ceased striking, however, than they rushed, or rather rolled in, all together—for the impediments of their chains caused most of the party to fall, and all to stumble as they entered."
"这在参加化装舞会的人群中间引起了一阵巨大的骚动，国王心里十分高兴。正如所预期的那样，宾客们要是没能准确地猜到是猩猩，多半也会把这些面目狰狞的生物当成是某种真正的野兽。许多女人被吓得晕倒了。若不是国王采取了预防措施，不让带任何武器进入大厅，他们一伙人可能很快就会为他们的这场闹剧付出血的代价。事实上，大家都朝门口涌去。但是国王早就已经下达了命令，他一上场就立即锁门，并且采纳了矮子的建议，把钥匙存放在他那里。","The excitement among the masqueraders was prodigious, and filled the heart of the king with glee.As had been anticipated, there were not a few of the guests who supposed the ferocious-looking creatures to be beasts of some kind in reality, if not precisely ourang-outangs.Many of the women swooned with affright; and had not the king taken the precaution to exclude all weapons from the saloon, his party might soon have expiated their frolic in their blood.As it was, a general rush was made for the doors; but the king had ordered them to be locked immediately upon his entrance; and, at the dwarf’s suggestion, the keys had been deposited with him."
"当骚乱到了极点，每个参加化装舞会的人都只顾自己的安危时（因为实际上真正的危险来自于恐慌的人群内的相互拥挤），平时用来悬挂吊灯、吊灯移除后被拉上去的铁链现在看起来却在渐渐地下降，直到它的铁钩下垂到了极限位置，离地面不到三英尺。","While the tumult was at its height, and each masquerader attentive only to his own safety (for, in fact, there was much real danger from the pressure of the excited crowd), the chain by which the chandelier ordinarily hung, and which had been drawn up on its removal, might have been seen very gradually to descend, until its hooked extremity came within three feet of the floor."
"紧接着，国王和他的七位朋友摇摇晃晃地朝着大厅的四面八方走去。最后他们来到了大厅中央，当然，一下子就能碰到那条铁链。当他们就位后，悄悄跟在他们后面的矮子，鼓动他们一直骚动下去，并抓住他们那两条铁链的十字交叉处，这两条铁链互相垂直，沿着两条直径贯穿了圆环。这时，他灵机一动，把钩子挂在了平时挂吊灯的地方。瞬时间，吊灯的铁链被拉到了很高的上方，以至于都够不着了，猩猩们就自然而然地被紧紧地拉在了一起，面面相对。","Soon after this, the king and his seven friends having reeled about the hall in all directions, found themselves, at length, in its centre, and, of course, in immediate contact with the chain.While they were thus situated, the dwarf, who had followed noiselessly at their heels, inciting them to keep up the commotion, took hold of their own chain at the intersection of the two portions which crossed the circle diametrically and at right angles.Here, with the rapidity of thought, he inserted the hook from which the chandelier had been wont to depend; and, in an instant, by some unseen agency, the chandelier-chain was drawn so far upward as to take the hook out of reach, and, as an inevitable consequence, to drag the ourang-outangs together in close connection, and face to face."
"这时，参加化装舞会的人们才有点从惊慌中缓过神来。他们开始把整件事看作是一个精心设计的闹剧，于是面对着猩猩们的窘相禁不住开怀大笑。","The masqueraders, by this time, had recovered, in some measure, from their alarm; and, beginning to regard the whole matter as a well-contrived pleasantry, set up a loud shout of laughter at the predicament of the apes."
"“把他们交给我吧！”这时跳蛙尖叫道，他的尖叫声在十分喧闹的环境下也很容易听得见。“把他们交给我吧。我想我认识他们。我只要能好好地看一看他们，我很快就能分辨出他们是什么人了。”","“Leave them to me!” now screamed Hop-Frog, his shrill voice making itself easily heard through all the din.“Leave them to me.I fancy I know them.If I can only get a good look at them, I can soon tell who they are.”"
"这时，他爬过人群头顶上方，设法挤到墙边上。在那里，他从一个女像石柱上取下一支火把，然后返回到了大厅中央。他像猴子一样敏捷地跳到国王的头顶上，顺着铁链向上爬了几英尺，向下压低了火把来观察那群猩猩，同时嘴里还在尖叫：“我马上就会认出他们是什么人了！”","Here, scrambling over the heads of the crowd, he managed to get to the wall; when, seizing a flambeau from one of the Caryatides, he returned, as he went, to the centre of the room-leaping, with the agility of a monkey, upon the king’s head, and thence clambered a few feet up the chain; holding down the torch to examine the group of ourang-outangs, and still screaming: “I shall soon find out who they are!”"
"此时，正当所有的人（包括猩猩们）都在捧腹大笑时，小丑突然吹了一个尖锐的口哨。那条铁链猛然升高了大概有三十英尺——把惊慌失措、挣扎着的猩猩们拽了上去，使他们悬吊在天窗和地面之间的半空中。铁链上升时，跳蛙一直紧抓着铁链，仍然保持着他和八个戴假面具人的相对位置，依旧（若无其事一般）继续把他的火把往下照着他们，好像在努力地想要辨认出他们到底是什么人。","And now, while the whole assembly (the apes included) were convulsed with laughter, the jester suddenly uttered a shrill whistle; when the chain flew violently up for about thirty feet—dragging with it the dismayed and struggling ourang-outangs, and leaving them suspended in mid-air between the sky-light and the floor.Hop-Frog, clinging to the chain as it rose, still maintained his relative position in respect to the eight maskers, and still (as if nothing were the matter) continued to thrust his torch down toward them, as though endeavoring to discover who they were."
"所有的人看着他们这群人上升时都完全惊呆了，一片死寂持续了有大约一分钟。寂静突然被一阵低沉、刺耳的摩擦声打破，正像当初国王把酒泼在特里佩塔脸上时引起他和大臣们注意的那种声音一样。但是，在眼下这种场合，这种声音从何而来是不言而喻的。这声音来自于一副尖牙——正如矮子的牙齿，他咬牙切齿、口吐白沫，脸上带着疯狂、愤怒的表情，用眼睛瞪着国王和他的七位大臣向上扬起的脸。","So thoroughly astonished was the whole company at this ascent, that a dead silence, of about a minute’s duration, ensued.It was broken by just such a low, harsh, grating sound, as had before attracted the attention of the king and his councillors when the former threw the wine in the face of Trippetta.But, on the present occasion, there could be no question as to whence the sound issued.It came from the fang—like teeth of the dwarf, who ground them and gnashed them as he foamed at the mouth, and glared, with an expression of maniacal rage, into the upturned countenances of the king and his seven companions."
"“啊，哈！”愤怒的小丑终于说道，“啊，哈！我现在开始看清楚这些是什么人了！”此时，他假装更加近距离地检查国王，把火把靠近包裹在国王身上的亚麻外衣，外衣立即燃起了一片熊熊大火。还不到半分钟，八只猩猩就都剧烈地燃烧了起来，下面的人抬头望着他们，尖叫着，一个个都吓得要死，却一点忙也帮不上。","“Ah, ha!” said at length the infuriated jester.“Ah, ha! I begin to see who these people are now!”Here, pretending to scrutinize the king more closely, he held the flambeau to the flaxen coat which enveloped him, and which instantly burst into a sheet of vivid flame.In less than half a minute the whole eight ourang-outangs were blazing fiercely, amid the shrieks of the multitude who gazed at them from below, horror-stricken, and without the power to render them the slightest assistance."
"最后，火焰的强度突然急剧增加。为了不被烧到，小丑只得沿着铁链往更高处爬。他这样爬的时候，人群再一次陷入了片刻的安静。矮子抓住时机，又开口说道：","At length the flames, suddenly increasing in virulence, forced the jester to climb higher up the chain, to be out of their reach; and, as he made this movement, the crowd again sank, for a brief instant, into silence.The dwarf seized his opportunity, and once more spoke:"
"“我现在看清楚了，”他说，“这些戴面具的是些什么人啊。他们是一位伟大的国王和他的七位枢密大臣——这位国王毫无顾忌地打了一位手无寸铁的姑娘，他的七位大臣则是帮凶。至于我呢，我只是跳蛙，那个小丑——这就是我所表演的最后一场闹剧了。”","“I now see distinctly.” he said, “what manner of people these maskers are.They are a great king and his seven privy-councillors,—a king who does not scruple to strike a defenceless girl and his seven councillors who abet him in the outrage.As for myself, I am simply Hop-Frog, the jester—and this is my last jest.”"
"因为亚麻和柏油都具有高度的易燃性，矮子那简短的话还没等讲完，复仇的工作就已经完成了。那八具尸体在铁链上晃悠着，变成了一团散发着恶臭、被烧得焦黑、丑陋的、难以辨认的东西。跛子把他的火把猛地投向他们，然后轻松自如地爬上了天花板，消失在了天窗口。","Owing to the high combustibility of both the flax and the tar to which it adhered, the dwarf had scarcely made an end of his brief speech before the work of vengeance was complete.The eight corpses swung in their chains, a fetid, blackened, hideous, and indistinguishable mass.The cripple hurled his torch at them, clambered leisurely to the ceiling, and disappeared through the sky-light."
"据说特里佩塔当时就在大厅屋顶上守候，她是她那急于复仇朋友的同谋。在这之后，他们就一起逃回了他们自己的家乡，因为此后就再没有人见到过他们了。","It is supposed that Trippetta, stationed on the roof of the saloon, had been the accomplice of her friend in his fiery revenge, and that, together, they effected their escape to their own country: for neither was seen again."
