"Blue Beard","蓝胡子"
"by Andrew Lang","作者：安德鲁·朗格"
"There was a man who had fine houses, both in town and country, a deal of silver and gold plate, embroidered furniture, and coaches gilded all over with gold.","从前有一个男人，在城里和乡下都有漂亮的房子。房子里有大量的金盘银盏、盖有绣花罩的家具和镀了金的马车。"
"But this man was so unlucky as to have a blue beard, which made him so frightfully ugly that all the women and girls ran away from him.","但不幸的是，这个男人长着蓝色的胡子，这使他看起来奇丑无比，无论是妇女还是姑娘们都离他远远的。"
"One of his neighbors, a lady of quality, had two daughters who were perfect beauties.","他的一个邻居是位贵妇，她的两个女儿都是绝顶美人。"
"He desired of her one of them in marriage, leaving to her choice which of the two she would bestow on him.","他希望贵妇把其中的一位女儿嫁给他，让她选择两个女儿中嫁哪个。"
"They would neither of them have him, and sent him backward and forward from one another, not being able to bear the thoughts of marrying a man who had a blue beard, and what besides gave them disgust and aversion was his having already been married to several wives, and nobody ever knew what became of them.","她们都不想嫁给他，相互推诿。她们都无法忍受跟一个蓝胡子的人结婚，更让她们反感的是蓝胡子已经娶了好几位妻子，而且没有人知道她们现在怎么样了。"
"Blue Beard, to engage their affection, took them, with the lady their mother and three or four ladies of their acquaintance, with other young people of the neighborhood, to one of his country seats, where they stayed a whole week.","蓝胡子为了赢得两位姑娘的好感，就带她们和她们的母亲还有三四个她们认识的女士以及邻里几个年轻人，一起去了他的一处乡间宅院，并在那儿呆了一个星期。"
"There was nothing then to be seen but parties of pleasure, hunting, fishing, dancing, mirth, and feasting.","在那里，终日看到的都是欢乐的派对、打猎、钓鱼、跳舞、欢笑，还有盛宴。"
"Nobody went to bed, but all passed the night in rallying and joking with each other.","大家相互打趣逗笑，彻夜不眠。"
"In short, everything succeeded so well that the youngest daughter began to think the master of the house not to have a beard so very blue, and that he was a mighty civil gentleman.","总而言之，一切都进行得很成功，以致后来那个最小的女儿开始觉得房子主人的蓝胡子不那么蓝了，觉得他是一个有魅力的文明绅士。"
"As soon as they returned home, the marriage was concluded.","他们一回到家就完婚了。"
"About a month afterward, Blue Beard told his wife that he was obliged to take a country journey for six weeks at least, about affairs of very great consequence, desiring her to divert herself in his absence, to send for her friends and acquaintances, to carry them into the country, if she pleased, and to make good cheer wherever she was.","大约一个月后，蓝胡子跟他的妻子说他有很重要的事，得去乡下至少六个星期，希望妻子在他不在的时候自己找法子消遣，可以邀请朋友或者熟人，带他们去乡下玩，只要她高兴，随她去哪儿玩都行。"
"“Here,” said he, “are the keys of the two great wardrobes, wherein I have my best furniture; these are of my silver and gold plate, which is not every day in use; these open my strong boxes, which hold my money, both gold and silver; these my caskets of jewels; and this is the master-key to all my apartments.","“这儿，”他说，“是两个大衣橱间的钥匙，里面放着我最好的家具；这些是打开金银餐具的钥匙，不是每天都用的；这些是打开放钱的保险柜的，里面有金有银；这是打开珠宝盒的钥匙；还有这是我所有房间的万能钥匙。"
"But for this little one here, it is the key of the closet at the end of the great gallery on the ground floor.","但是这把小钥匙，是一楼走廊尽头小房间的钥匙。"
"Open them all; go into all and every one of them, except that little closet, which I forbid you, and forbid it in such a manner that, if you happen to open it, there’s nothing but what you may expect from my just anger and resentment.”","所有的钥匙你都可以用；可以打开每个房间也可以进，除了那个小房间。我禁止你去那个小房间。这个禁止很严厉，如果你碰巧打开，我将对你只有愤怒和怨恨。”"
"She promised to observe, very exactly, whatever he had ordered; when he, after having embraced her, got into his coach and proceeded on his journey.","她答应会严格按照他所吩咐的去做；然后，他拥抱了她之后，上了马车，踏上了旅程。"
"Her neighbors and good friends did not stay to be sent for by the new married lady, so great was their impatience to see all the rich furniture of her house, not daring to come while her husband was there, because of his blue beard, which frightened them.","她的邻居和好友们没等这位新婚妻子邀请就来了，他们迫不及待地想看看这个房子的富丽家具。她丈夫不在的时候不敢来，是因为她们害怕他的蓝胡子。"
"They ran through all the rooms, closets, and wardrobes, which were all so fine and rich that they seemed to surpass one another.","他们不停地穿梭在各个房间、储物间和衣橱之间，到处都很精美、华丽，似乎是一处胜似一处。"
"After that they went up into the two great rooms, where was the best and richest furniture; they could not sufficiently admire the number and beauty of the tapestry, beds, couches, cabinets, stands, tables, and looking-glasses, in which you might see yourself from head to foot; some of them were framed with glass, others with silver, plain and gilded, the finest and most magnificent ever were seen.","之后他们进了那两个大房间，那里放着最好最精致的家具；挂毯、床、沙发、橱、置物台、桌子，还有可以照全身的镜子，这些东西的数量和精美让他们都赞叹不已；有的家具是用玻璃镶边的，有的是用银边包金的，其精美和豪华前所未见。"
"They ceased not to extol and envy the happiness of their friend, who in the meantime in no way diverted herself in looking upon all these rich things, because of the impatience she had to go and open the closet on the ground floor.","他们对朋友的幸福赞不绝口，也有一些嫉妒。而她，此时的精力一点儿都不在看这些精美的东西上，因为她急切地想去打开一楼的储藏室。"
"She was so much pressed by her curiosity that, without considering that it was very uncivil to leave her company, she went down a little back staircase, and with such excessive haste that she had twice or thrice like to have broken her neck.","她受好奇心的驱使，完全不顾丢下她的同伴们是否失礼，顺着后面的小楼梯下去了。她如此急切，甚至有两三次差点儿扭到了脖子。"
"Coming to the closet-door, she made a stop for some time, thinking upon her husband’s orders, and considering what unhappiness might attend her if she was disobedient; but the temptation was so strong she could not overcome it.","到了储藏室的门前，她停留了一会儿，想起了她丈夫的命令，也在想如果她不遵守会发生什么不幸的事。但是诱惑太强烈了，以至于她无法克服。"
"She then took the little key, and opened it, trembling, but could not at first see anything plainly, because the windows were shut.","于是，她拿出小钥匙，颤抖着打开了储藏室，但是因为窗户是关着的，所以一开始什么都没看清。"
"After some moments she began to perceive that the floor was all covered over with clotted blood, on which lay the bodies of several dead women, ranged against the walls.","过了片刻，她开始见到地板上布满了凝结的血迹，上面还躺着几个死去的女人，尸体靠着墙排着。"
"(These were all the wives whom Blue Beard had married and murdered, one after another.)","（这些就是蓝胡子的妻子们，跟他结婚后，她们都相继被杀了。）"
"She thought she should have died for fear, and the key, which she pulled out of the lock, fell out of her hand.","她觉得自己都快怕死了，她把钥匙从锁里拔出，钥匙接着从她的手里掉了下去。"
"After having somewhat recovered her surprise, she took up the key, locked the door, and went upstairs into her chamber to recover herself; but she could not, she was so much frightened.","她从震惊中回过神来，捡起钥匙，锁好门，上楼回到她的房间去让自己镇定下来；但是，她做不到，她害怕极了。"
"Having observed that the key of the closet was stained with blood, she tried two or three times to wipe it off, but the blood would not come out; in vain did she wash it, and even rub it with soap and sand; the blood still remained, for the key was magical and she could never make it quite clean; when the blood was gone off from one side, it came again on the other.","她发现储藏室的钥匙上沾了血迹，试着两三次去擦拭，但是上面的血还是去不掉；她又进行了清洗甚至用肥皂和砂纸摩擦，还是白费了力气；血迹仍然在上面，因为这个钥匙是施了魔法的，她不可能完全清洗干净；当一边的清洗干净，另一边的又会出现。"
"Blue Beard returned from his journey the same evening, and said he had received letters upon the road, informing him that the affair he went about was ended to his advantage.","就在那天晚上，蓝胡子旅行回来了，他说他在路上收到了信，得知他要办的事情已经顺利完成。"
"His wife did all she could to convince him she was extremely glad of his speedy return.","他的妻子竭尽全力想说服他相信，他这么快就能回家她感到十分高兴。"
"Next morning he asked her for the keys, which she gave him, but with such a trembling hand that he easily guessed what had happened.","第二天早晨，他向她要回钥匙，她给了他，但手抖得如此厉害，以至于他很容易就猜到发生了什么。"
"“What!” said he, “is not the key of my closet among the rest?”","“什么！”他说，“我储藏室的钥匙不在这里面？”"
"“I must certainly have left it above upon the table,” said she.","“我肯定把它放在了桌子上，”她回答说。"
"“Fail not to bring it to me presently,” said Blue Beard.","“最好现在拿给我，”蓝胡子说。"
"After several goings backward and forward she was forced to bring him the key.","几番徘徊之后，她不得不把钥匙拿给他。"
"Blue Beard, having very attentively considered it, said to his wife,","蓝胡子非常仔细地审视了一番，跟他妻子说，"
"“How comes this blood upon the key?”","“钥匙上怎么会有血？”"
"“I do not know,” cried the poor woman, paler than death.","“我不知道。”可怜的女人哭着说，面色比死人还要苍白。"
"“You do not know!” replied Blue Beard.","“你不知道！”蓝胡子回答道，"
"“I very well know.","“我很清楚。"
"You were resolved to go into the closet, were you not?","你曾决定进入那个储藏室的，是不是？"
"Mighty well, madam; you shall go in, and take your place among the ladies you saw there.”","很好，夫人；你也将要进去了，在你看到的那些女士之间找个位置吧。”"
"Upon this she threw herself at her husband’s feet, and begged his pardon with all the signs of true repentance, vowing that she would never more be disobedient.","这时候，他跪在丈夫的面前，真切地忏悔着乞求他的原谅，发誓她再也不会违背他了。"
"She would have melted a rock, so beautiful and sorrowful was she; but Blue Beard had a heart harder than any rock!","她这么美丽这么悲伤，岩石都要被她感动了；但是蓝胡子的心比石头还硬！"
"“You must die, madam,” said he, “and that presently.”","“你必须死，夫人，”他说，“而且，就是现在。”"
"“Since I must die,” answered she (looking upon him with her eyes all bathed in tears), “give me some little time to say my prayers.”","“既然我非死不可，”她回答说（眼泪汪汪地看着他），“给我一点儿时间来祷告吧。”"
"“I give you,” replied Blue Beard, “half a quarter of an hour, but not one moment more.”","“给你时间，”蓝胡子回答道，“半刻钟，一分钟都不能多。”"
"When she was alone she called out to her sister, and said to her:","她独自一个人的时候给他姐姐打了电话，跟她说："
"“Sister Anne” (for that was her name), “go up, I beg you, upon the top of the tower, and look if my brothers are not coming over; they promised me that they would come to-day, and if you see them, give them a sign to make haste.”","“安妮姐姐”（那是她的名字），“上楼，我求你了，快点儿到楼的顶上去看我的哥哥们有没有过来；他们答应我今天会过来的，如果你看到他们，示意他们快点儿。”"
"Her sister Anne went up upon the top of the tower, and the poor afflicted wife cried out from time to time:","她的姐姐安妮上了楼的顶端，这位可怜的妻子时不时大声喊着："
"“Anne, sister Anne, do you see anyone coming?”","“安妮，安妮姐姐，你看到有人来了吗？”"
"And sister Anne said:","安妮姐姐回答说："
"“I see nothing but the sun, which makes a dust, and the grass, which looks green.”","“除了明媚的太阳，我什么都没看到，还有绿油油的草地。”"
"In the meanwhile Blue Beard, holding a great sabre in his hand, cried out as loud as he could bawl to his wife:","就在这个时候，蓝胡子手执长剑，冲着他妻子放声大叫道："
"“Come down instantly, or I shall come up to you.”","“立马下来，否则我就上去找你了。”"
"“One moment longer, if you please,” said his wife, and then she cried out very softly, “Anne, sister Anne, dost thou see anybody coming?”","“再给一分钟，如果你同意的话，”他妻子答道，然后她轻轻地哭着对她姐姐说，“安妮，你看到有人过来么？”"
"And sister Anne answered:","安妮姐姐回答说："
"“I see nothing but the sun, which makes a dust, and the grass, which is green.”","“除了明媚的太阳和绿油油的草地，我什么都没看到。”"
"“Come down quickly,” cried Blue Beard, “or I will come up to you.”","“快点儿下来，”蓝胡子大喊道，“否则我就上去了。”"
"“I am coming,” answered his wife; and then she cried, “Anne, sister Anne, dost thou not see anyone coming?”","“我来了，”妻子回答道，接着就哭着说，“安妮，安妮姐姐，你谁都没有看到吗？”"
"“I see,” replied sister Anne, “a great dust, which comes on this side here.”","“我看到了，”她说，“尘土飞扬，往这边来了。”"
"“Are they my brothers?”","“是哥哥们吗？”"
"“Alas! no, my dear sister, I see a flock of sheep.”","“啊！不是，亲爱的妹妹，我看到了一群羊。”"
"“Will you not come down?” cried Blue Beard","“你不下来吗？”蓝胡子大喊道。"
"“One moment longer,” said his wife, and then she cried out: “Anne, sister Anne, dost thou see nobody coming?”","“再给一分钟，”妻子回答说，然后她又哭着说：“安妮，安妮姐姐，你有没有看到人来啊？”"
"“I see,” said she, “two horsemen, but they are yet a great way off.”","“我看到了，”她回答说，“两个人骑着马，但是他们离这里很远。”"
"“God be praised,” replied the poor wife joyfully; “they are my brothers; I will make them a sign, as well as I can, for them to make haste.”","“上帝保佑，”可怜的妻子欣喜地回答说；“他们是我的哥哥；我应该示意他们，让他们快点儿过来。”"
"Then Blue Beard bawled out so loud that he made the whole house tremble.","蓝胡子大声呼喊着，震得整个房子都在颤抖。"
"The distressed wife came down, and threw herself at his feet, all in tears, with her hair about her shoulders.","不幸的妻子下楼了，跪在他脚下，泪流满面，头发披到了肩上。"
"“This signifies nothing,” says Blue Beard; “you must die”; then, taking hold of her hair with one hand, and lifting up the sword with the other, he was going to take off her head.","“没有意义的，”蓝胡子说，“你必须死”；接着，一只手抓着她的头发，另一只手把剑，准备砍下她的头。"
"The poor lady, turning about to him, and looking at him with dying eyes, desired him to afford her one little moment to recollect herself.","可怜的女人，转过来对着他，用垂死的眼神看着他，希望他能给自己一点儿时间收拾一下自己。"
"“No, no,” said he, “recommend thyself to God,” and was just ready to strike...","“不，不，”他说，“向上帝自荐吧。”正准备刺下去……"
"At this very instant there was such a loud knocking at the gate that Blue Beard made a sudden stop.","就在这个时候，响起了一阵敲门声，蓝胡子突然停了下来。"
"The gate was opened, and presently entered two horsemen, who, drawing their swords, ran directly to Blue Beard.","门打开了，两个骑马的男子立马进来了，他们带着剑，直接奔向蓝胡子。"
"He knew them to be his wife’s brothers, one a dragoon, the other a musketeer, so that he ran away immediately to save himself; but the two brothers pursued so close that they overtook him before he could get to the steps of the porch, when they ran their swords through his body and left him dead.","他知道这是妻子的两个哥哥，其中一个是龙骑兵，另一个是火枪手，于是，他赶紧逃命；但是两兄弟穷追不舍,在他迈上走廊的台阶之前赶上了他，他们挥出长剑刺穿了他的身体，杀了他。"
"The poor wife was almost as dead as her husband, and had not strength enough to rise and welcome her brothers.","那可怜的妻子跟丈夫一样快要死了，都没有足够的力气站起来欢迎她的哥哥们。"
"Blue Beard had no heirs, and so his wife became mistress of all his estate.","蓝胡子没有继承人，因而他的妻子成了他财产的主人。"
"She made use of one part of it to marry her sister Anne to a young gentleman who had loved her a long while; another part to buy captains commissions for her brothers, and the rest to marry herself to a very worthy gentleman, who made her forget the ill time she had passed with Blue Beard. ","她用一部分财产把她姐姐嫁给了一个爱慕她已久的绅士；另一部分给她的哥哥，买了队长的职位；剩下的一部分用来把自己嫁了一个值得尊敬的绅士，他让她忘记了跟蓝胡子在一起的痛苦时光。"
