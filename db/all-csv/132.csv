"那时候，在肯塔基州（这是尊敬的K—先生说的），对于所谓的“运气游戏”，法律是严令禁止的。大约有十二个男孩在玩“七分牌戏”赌钱时被抓了个正着，于是大陪审团决定对他们提出公诉。当然，吉姆·斯特吉斯被聘请来为他们进行开庭辩护。他越是认真地研究这个案子，仔细地调查取证，他就越清楚最后他肯定会输掉这个官司——这个令人痛苦的事实没有回旋的余地。这些男孩们当时确实是在碰运气的游戏上赌钱了。大家甚至都开始同情起斯特吉斯来。人们说，眼看着这么一个必定会对他不利的大案子破坏他一帆风顺的职业生涯，实在是太遗憾了。","At that time, in Kentucky (said the Hon. Mr. K—); the law was very strict against what is termed “games of chance.”About a dozen of the boys were detected playing “seven up” or “old sledge” for money, and the grand jury found a true bill against them.Jim Sturgis was retained to defend them when the case came up, of course.The more he studied over the matter, and looked into the evidence, the plainer it was that he must lose a case at last—there was no getting around that painful fact.Those boys had certainly been betting money on a game of chance.Even public sympathy was roused in behalf of Sturgis.People said it was a pity to see him mar his successful career with a big prominent case like this, which must go against him."
"可经过好几个不眠之夜后，一个好主意忽然闪现在斯特吉斯的心头，他高兴地从床上跳了起来。他认为自己找到了解决问题的办法。第二天，他先是和他的那几个当事人以及几位朋友低语了几句。等开庭时，他承认当事人玩了七分牌戏，也承认赌博，但使人震惊的是，他竟然放肆大胆地提出七分牌戏不是碰运气游戏的抗辩，并将其作为唯一的辩护理由！老于世故的观众们都咧嘴大笑起来。法官和其余人也都笑了。但斯特吉斯却面不改色、一本正经，甚至表情还有些严肃。反方辩护律师试图对他的论点嘲弄一番，却没成功。法官用沉闷的审判口吻取笑斯特吉斯，但他不为所动。事情变得严肃起来。法官有点儿失去耐心了，称玩笑到此为止。吉姆·斯特吉斯称他并不认为这件事有任何可笑之处——在证明这个游戏确实是碰运气的游戏之前，不能因为某些人认为它是碰运气的游戏，他的当事人们就要因为沉迷于此而受到处罚。法官和诉讼律师说这很简单，于是立刻召来乔布执事、彼得斯执事、伯克执事、约翰逊执事、沃特牧师和米格儿牧师出庭作证；他们全体一致，强烈反对斯特吉斯的法律狡辩，声称七分牌戏就是碰运气的游戏。","But after several restless nights an inspired idea flashed upon Sturgis, and he sprang out of bed delighted.He thought he saw his way through.The next day he whispered around a little among his clients and a few friends, and then when the case came up in court he acknowledged the seven-up and the betting, and, as his sole defense, had the astounding effrontery to put in the plea that old sledge was not a game of chance!There was the broadest sort of a smile all over the faces of that sophisticated audience.The judge smiled with the rest.But Sturgis maintained a countenance whose earnestness was even severe.The opposite counsel tried to ridicule him out of his position, and did not succeed.The judge jested in a ponderous judicial way about the thing, but did not move him.The matter was becoming grave.The judge lost a little of his patience, and said the joke had gone far enough.Jim Sturgis said he knew of no joke in the matter—his clients could not be punished for indulging in what some people chose to consider a game of chance until it was proven that it was a game of chance.Judge and counsel said that would be an easy matter, and forthwith called Deacons Job, Peters, Burke, and Johnson, and Dominies Wirt and Miggles, to testify; and they unanimously and with strong feeling put down the legal quibble of Sturgis by pronouncing that old sledge was a game of chance."
"“那你叫它什么？”法官问。","“What do you call it now?” said the judge."
"“我叫它科学游戏！”斯特吉斯反驳道，“而且我也能证明！”","“I call it a game of science!” retorted Sturgis; “and I’ll prove it, too!”"
"他们明白了他的小把戏。","They saw his little game."
"他召来一大群证人，提供了大量证据，以证明七分牌戏不是运气游戏而是科学游戏。","He brought in a cloud of witnesses, and produced an overwhelming mass of testimony, to show that old sledge was not a game of chance but a game of science."
"这本应是世界上最简单的案子，现在却不知为何变得极为棘手了。法官不知所措地挠了一会儿头，说没办法作出判决，因为就像许多人能被找来出庭为一方作证一样，同样多的人也能被找来为另一方作证。但他说他很愿意作出对各方来说都很公正的判决，也将采纳斯特吉斯先生提出的任何能够解决这个难题的建议。","Instead of being the simplest case in the world, it had somehow turned out to be an excessively knotty one.The judge scratched his head over it awhile, and said there was no way of coming to a determination, because just as many men could be brought into court who would testify on one side as could be found to testify on the other.But he said he was willing to do the fair thing by all parties, and would act upon any suggestion Mr. Sturgis would make for the solution of the difficulty."
"斯特吉斯先生立刻站起身来。","Mr. Sturgis was on his feet in a second."
"“将陪审团分为两组，每组六人，分别代表运气和科学。给他们蜡烛和两副扑克牌。送他们进陪审团休息室，然后只需接受结果就行了！”","“Impanel a jury of six of each, Luck versus Science.Give them candles and a couple of decks of cards.Send them into the jury-room, and just abide by the result!”"
"大家对这个提议的公平性并无异议。那四位执事和两名牧师宣誓成为“运气”一方的陪审员，而六个玩七分牌戏上瘾的老玩家则被选为代表“科学”的一方。他们退庭，进入陪审团休息室。","There was no disputing the fairness of the proposition.The four deacons and the two dominies were sworn in as the “chance” jurymen, and six inveterate old seven-up professors were chosen to represent the “science” side of the issue.They retired to the jury-room."
"约两小时后，彼得斯执事派人来法庭向一个朋友借了三美元。［法庭上一阵骚动。］又过了约两个小时，米格儿牧师派人来法庭向一个朋友借“赌金”。［又是一阵骚动。］在接下去的三四个小时里，另一位牧师和另外几位执事也都派人来法庭向朋友们借小额贷款。法庭上拥挤的观众们仍然等待着，因为在公牛街角这个地方，这可算是一个非比寻常的场面，每家的父亲必定都对此抱有极大的兴趣。","In about two hours Deacon Peters sent into court to borrow three dollars from a friend.[Sensation.]In about two hours more Dominie Miggles sent into court to borrow a “stake” from a friend.[Sensation.]During the next three or four hours the other dominie and the other deacons sent into court for small loans.And still the packed audience waited, for it was a prodigious occasion in Bull’s Corners, and one in which every father of a family was necessarily interested."
"剩下的故事可以一笔带过了。天快亮时，陪审团进来了，主席乔布执事宣读了以下判决：","The rest of the story can be told briefly.About daylight the jury came in, and Deacon Job, the foreman, read the following:"
"判决：","VERDICT:"
"作为肯塔基州针对约翰·惠勒等人一案的陪审团，我们在认真考虑案件的具体细节并事先检验一些理论的法律依据后，在此一致判定，通常所说的七分牌戏明显是科学游戏，而不是运气游戏。关于此事的论证，经过一整晚的陈述、申明、再次重申、详细解释，结果表明：尽管双方的水平都很一般，且经常势均力敌，但整个晚上，“运气”一方的人从未赢过一次游戏，也从没翻到过一个杰克；此外，为了支持我们的判决，我们提醒大家注意一个重要事实：“运气”一方的人都已输光了钱，而“科学”一方的人赢了钱。本陪审团经过慎重考虑后作出裁决，认为对于七分牌戏来说，“运气”理论是个有害无益的学说，目的是让那些相信该学说的群体遭受不可估量的痛苦和经济损失。","We, the jury in the case of the Commonwealth of Kentucky vs. John Wheeler et al., have carefully considered the points of the case, and tested the merits of the several theories advanced, and do hereby unanimously decide that the game commonly known as old sledge or seven-up is eminently a game of science and not of chance.In demonstration whereof it is hereby and herein stated, iterated, reiterated, set forth, and made manifest that, during the entire night, the “chance” men never won a game or turned a jack, although both feats were common and frequent to the opposition; and furthermore, in support of this our verdict, we call attention to the significant fact that the “chance” men are all busted, and the “science” men have got the money.It is the deliberate opinion of this jury, that the “chance” theory concerning seven-up is a pernicious doctrine, and calculated to inflict untold suffering and pecuniary loss upon any community that takes stock in it."
"“这就是七分牌戏为何被作为科学游戏而非运气游戏，在肯塔基州的各种法令全书中被突出显示并列举出来的原因，因此遵照该法令，玩该游戏免受责罚。”K—先生说，“这项判决被记录在案，至今仍然有效。”","“That is the way that seven-up came to be set apart and particularized in the statute-books of Kentucky as being a game not of chance but of science, and therefore not punishable under the law,” said Mr. K—.“That verdict is of record, and holds good to this day.”"
