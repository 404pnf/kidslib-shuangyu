"作者：杰克·伦敦","By Jack London"
"草地被露水浸湿了，因此她回屋去穿胶皮鞋，耽搁了一会儿。她从屋子里走出来，发现等待她的丈夫正如痴如醉地盯着一朵即将绽放的杏花。她的目光扫过在果园内外高高的草丛，似乎在寻找什么。","She had delayed, because of the dew-wet grass, in order to put on her overshoes, and when she emerged from the house found her waiting husband absorbed in the wonder of a bursting almond-bud.She sent a questing glance across the tall grass and in and out among the orchard trees."
"“沃尔夫去哪儿了？”她问道。","“Where’s Wolf?” she asked."
"“刚才还在这儿的。”沃尔特·欧文将自己从生命的奇迹——花朵的诗意和哲理之中拽了出来，也开始四处张望，“我上次看到它时，它在追一只兔子。”","“He was here a moment ago.”Walt Irvine drew himself away with a jerk from the metaphysics and poetry of the organic miracle of blossom, and surveyed the landscape.“He was running a rabbit the last I saw of him.”"
"“沃尔夫！沃尔夫！到这儿来，沃尔夫！”他们离开空地，踏上小径，穿过蜡白的钟形熊果树丛，走到了县公路上，这一路上，她都这么呼唤着。","“Wolf!Wolf!Here Wolf!” she called, as they left the clearing and took the trail that led down through the waxen-belled manzanita jungle to the county road."
"欧文把两个小指头塞到唇边，吹出尖利的哨声，权当为她帮腔了。","Irvine thrust between his lips the little finger of each hand and lent to her efforts a shrill whistling."
"她赶紧捂住耳朵，做出一副痛苦的表情。","She covered her ears hastily and made a wry grimace."
"“天啊！一个文质彬彬的诗人，居然会搞出这种难听的噪音来。我的鼓膜都要被刺穿了。你的哨声简直胜过……”","“My! for a poet, delicately attuned and all the rest of it, you can make unlovely noises.My ear-drums are pierced.You outwhistle—”"
"“大琴师俄尔甫斯。”","“Orpheus.”"
"“我要说的是胜过街头小野孩。”她严肃地说。","“I was about to say a street-arab,” she concluded severely."
"“诗歌也不能阻止人有现实的想法嘛——至少不能阻止我。有的天才拿不出好的诗文卖给杂志，才毫无价值，我不是这样的。”","“Poesy does not prevent one from being practical—at least it doesn’t prevent ME.Mine is no futility of genius that can’t sell gems to the magazines.”"
"他摆出一副放浪不羁的样子，接着说：","He assumed a mock extravagance, and went on:"
"“我不是躲进小楼孤芳自赏、混进舞场沽名钓誉之辈。为什么呢？因为我很现实。我的诗不是那种转化不出钱来的劣诗，它们有很好的价码，可以变成花团锦簇的小屋，美丽的山间牧场，一片红杉林，种着三十七棵树的果园，长长的一垄黑莓，短短的两垄草莓，更不用提那条四分之一英里长的潺潺的小溪。我是一个卖美好的人，一个卖诗的人，我追求的是实用，亲爱的马奇。感谢杂志编辑，我写出一首诗，就能将它转化为一阵西风，叹息着刮过我们的红杉林；转化为一脉清流，淌过遍布青苔的岩石，再吟唱出一首诗，可以与我那篇，呃，转化得很棒的诗相媲美。”","“I am no attic singer, no ballroom warbler.And why?Because I am practical.Mine is no squalor of song that cannot transmute itself, with proper exchange value, into a flower-crowned cottage, a sweet mountain-meadow, a grove of red-woods, an orchard of thirty-seven trees, one long row of blackberries and two short rows of strawberries, to say nothing of a quarter of a mile of gurgling brook.I am a beauty-merchant, a trader in song, and I pursue utility, dear Madge.I sing a song, and thanks to the magazine editors I transmute my song into a waft of the west wind sighing through our redwoods, into a murmur of waters over mossy stones that sings back to me another song than the one I sang and yet the same song wonderfully—er—transmuted.”"
"“哦？你的诗歌都能转化得如此成功？”她大笑起来。","“O that all your song-transmutations were as successful!” she laughed."
"“那你说个不成功的例子看看。”","“Name one that wasn’t.”"
"“那两首不错的十四行诗就是，换来的奶牛是镇上最差的了。”","“Those two beautiful sonnets that you transmuted into the cow that was accounted the worst milker in the township.”"
"“奶牛很漂亮……”他开口说道。","“She was beautiful—” he began,"
"“但是不产奶啊。”马奇插嘴到。","“But she didn’t give milk,” Madge interrupted."
"“不过真的很漂亮，不是么？”他还在坚持。","“But she WAS beautiful, now, wasn’t she?” he insisted."
"“漂亮是漂亮，没有实用性，”这就是她的回答，“哎，沃尔夫在那儿！”","“And here’s where beauty and utility fall out,” was her reply.“And there’s the Wolf!”"
"从灌木密布的山坡上传来一阵窸窸窣窣的声音，接着，在他们头顶四十英尺的陡崖边上，探出一头狼的脑袋和肩头。它紧握的前爪碰落了一块碎石，它竖起耳朵，紧盯着这块石头。直到石块落到他们的脚边，它才移开目光，张开嘴，向他们欢叫不已。","From the thicket-covered hillside came a crashing of underbrush, and then, forty feet above them, on the edge of the sheer wall of rock, appeared a wolf’s head and shoulders.His braced fore paws dislodged a pebble, and with sharp-pricked ears and peering eyes he watched the fall of the pebble till it struck at their feet.Then he transferred his gaze and with open mouth laughed down at them."
"两人都在喊：“沃尔夫，沃尔夫！”“亲爱的沃尔夫！”","“You Wolf, you!” and “You blessed Wolf!” the man and woman called out to him."
"听见声音，沃尔夫垂下耳朵，像被一只无形的手抚摸着一样，脸上现出很享受的样子。","The ears flattened back and down at the sound, and the head seemed to snuggle under the caress of an invisible hand."
"他们看着沃尔夫又蹿入了丛林之中，于是接着往前走。几分钟之后，沃尔夫从坡度较为平缓的一个拐角跑下来跟他们会合，一路扬起一大片碎石和尘土。它还是比较内敛的。男人摸了摸它的耳朵，女人抚摸了它好一阵，接着，它又跑到前面去了；它轻快地跑着，就像一头真正的狼。","They watched him scramble backward into the thicket, then proceeded on their way.Several minutes later, rounding a turn in the trail where the descent was less precipitous, he joined them in the midst of a miniature avalanche of pebbles and loose soil.He was not demonstrative.A pat and a rub around the ears from the man, and a more prolonged caressing from the woman, and he was away down the trail in front of them, gliding effortlessly over the ground in true wolf fashion."
"从体型、皮毛和尾巴来看，它就是一头硕大的森林狼，但它的毛色和斑纹暴露了它不是狼。这条狗完全就是在展现它的特征。没有哪头狼是像它这样的毛色。它呈现出棕色、深棕色、红棕色，简直是棕色的大集合。背上和肩上是深棕色的，两边的棕色要浅一些，到了腹部又成了黄色；由于其中混杂着一些棕色，黄色的腹部看上去脏兮兮的。喉咙、爪子和眼部的白色斑点在满身的棕色映衬下，也显得脏脏的；两只眼睛像两块黄宝石，透着金色和棕色的光芒。","In build and coat and brush he was a huge timber-wolf; but the lie was given to his wolfhood by his color and marking.There the dog unmistakably advertised itself.No wolf was ever colored like him.He was brown, deep brown, red-brown, an orgy of browns.Back and shoulders were a warm brown that paled on the sides and underneath to a yellow that was dingy because of the brown that lingered in it.The white of the throat and paws and the spots over the eyes was dirty because of the persistent and ineradicable brown, while the eyes themselves were twin topazes, golden and brown."
"两人都非常喜爱这条狗，或许是因为要赢得它的欢心相当不容易吧。从一开始就非常不容易，当时沃尔夫神秘地降临他们的山间小屋，谁也不知道它从哪里来的。它疲乏不堪、饥肠辘辘，就在他们的窗下当着欧文和马奇的面咬死了一只兔子，然后爬到黑莓丛旁边的泉水边上躺了下来。当沃尔特·欧文过去查看这个入侵者的时候，它冲着欧文低低地吼着；马奇为了表示友好，端去一大盘面包和牛奶，也遭到了同样的冷遇。","The man and woman loved the dog very much; perhaps this was because it had been such a task to win his love.It had been no easy matter when he first drifted in mysteriously out of nowhere to their little mountain cottage.Footsore and famished, he had killed a rabbit under their very noses and under their very windows, and then crawled away and slept by the spring at the foot of the blackberry bushes.When Walt Irvine went down to inspect the intruder, he was snarled at for his pains, and Madge likewise was snarled at when she went down to present, as a peace-offering, a large pan of bread and milk."
"它可算是最不好相处的狗了，只要他们一走近，就怒目相向；它也不许两人摸它一下，总是亮出尖牙，毛发直立，把两人吓回去。不过，它还是留了下来，在泉水边睡觉、休养；只要两人在安全的距离之外放下食物，然后退回去，它也还是会吃的。它在此逗留，是因为身体状况实在糟糕；几天之后，它身体复原，就不见了踪影。","A most unsociable dog he proved to be, resenting all their advances, refusing to let them lay hands on him, menacing them with bared fangs and bristling hair.Nevertheless he remained, sleeping and resting by the spring, and eating the food they gave him after they set it down at a safe distance and retreated.His wretched physical condition explained why he lingered; and when he had recuperated, after several days’ sojourn, he disappeared."
"如果不是这个时候欧文有事前往本州北部，他和妻子本来以为这件事就这样结束了。在加利福尼亚和俄勒冈交界的地方，他坐在火车上，碰巧向窗外望去，就看见了那位不好相处的访客正沿着马车道前行。这条一身棕色、狼一样的狗看上去很疲乏，却还是不知疲倦地走着；历经两百英里的跋涉，它全身都糊满了尘土。","And this would have been the end of him, so far as Irvine and his wife were concerned, had not Irvine at that particular time been called away into the northern part of the state.Riding along on the train, near to the line between California and Oregon, he chanced to look out of the window and saw his unsociable guest sliding along the wagon road, brown and wolfish, tired yet tireless, dust-covered and soiled with two hundred miles of travel."
"欧文是个很冲动的人，是个诗人。他在下一站下了车，在肉店买了一块肉，在小镇边上就俘获了这条流浪的狗。回程沃尔夫就坐进了行李车厢，它也第二次来到了那间山间小屋。它在小屋里被拴了一个星期，两人轮番地讨好它。他们讨它欢心的办法真是细心又周到。它就像来自外星，遥远、生疏、格格不入；对他们温柔的甜言蜜语，它总是抱以低吼。它从不吠叫。在和欧文和马奇在一起的日子里，两人从来没听见过它吠叫。","Now Irvine was a man of impulse, a poet.He got off the train at the next station, bought a piece of meat at a butcher shop, and captured the vagrant on the outskirts of the town.The return trip was made in the baggage car, and so Wolf came a second time to the mountain cottage.Here he was tied up for a week and made love to by the man and woman.But it was very circumspect love-making.Remote and alien as a traveller from another planet, he snarled down their soft-spoken love-words.He never barked.In all the time they had him he was never known to bark."
"要征服它成了一个难题。但欧文就是喜欢难题。他找人做了一块金属牌子，在上面印上：请送还沃尔特·欧文，加利福尼亚州索诺马县格伦埃伦。然后把这块牌子铆在一个项圈上，把项圈套在沃尔夫的脖子上。接着，欧文就放了沃尔夫，这家伙立马就跑不见了。一天以后，从门多西诺县拍来了一份电报。二十个小时内这条狗一路北上，狂奔了一百多英里，而且是在行进的途中被抓住的。","To win him became a problem.Irvine liked problems.He had a metal plate made, on which was stamped: RETURN TO WALT IRVINE, GLEN ELLEN, SONOMA COUNTY, CALIFORNIA.This was riveted to a collar and strapped about the dog’s neck.Then he was turned loose, and promptly he disappeared.A day later came a telegram from Mendocino County.In twenty hours he had made over a hundred miles to the north, and was still going when captured."
"富国银行的快递车将它送了回来，欧文把它拴了三天，又放开，它就又跑了。这一次，它已经跑到了俄勒冈南部，还是给抓住送回来了。每次它一获自由，便飞快地逃走，而且总是逃向北方。它有一种奔向北方的痴念。接着这次，欧文花了一首十四行诗的代价，把它从俄勒冈北部带了回来；此后，欧文就把这种痴念称为“返家的本能”。","He came back by Wells Fargo Express, was tied up three days, and was loosed on the fourth and lost.This time he gained southern Oregon before he was caught and returned.Always, as soon as he received his liberty, he fled away, and always he fled north.He was possessed of an obsession that drove him north.The homing instinct, Irvine called it, after he had expended the selling price of a sonnet in getting the animal back from northern Oregon."
"还有一次，这个棕色的漫游者成功穿越了半个加利福尼亚，整个俄勒冈，以及华盛顿的大部分地方，最终还是给抓住遣送了回来。它行进的速度令人吃惊。每次吃饱睡足之后，它一获得自由就把所有的能量都释放在狂奔之上。第一天，它通常可以跑过一百五十英里，之后，每天平均一百英里，直到被抓住为止。它被送回来的时候总是瘦削不堪、饥肠辘辘、野性十足，每次离开的时候则是精神焕发、体力充沛，为了响应那没人能明白的召唤，一路向北。","Another time the brown wanderer succeeded in traversing half the length of California, all of Oregon, and most of Washington, before he was picked up and returned “Collect.”A remarkable thing was the speed with which he travelled.Fed up and rested, as soon as he was loosed he devoted all his energy to getting over the ground.On the first day’s run he was known to cover as high as a hundred and fifty miles, and after that he would average a hundred miles a day until caught.He always arrived back lean and hungry and savage, and always departed fresh and vigorous, cleaving his way northward in response to some prompting of his being that no one could understand."
"最终，在徒劳无功地飞奔了一年之后，它终于接受了无可逃避的选择，留了下来，留在这个它第一次咬死兔子、在泉水边歇息的地方。即便这样之后，熬过了好长一段时间，两人才得以成功地摸一摸它。这是一个伟大的胜利，因为他们是唯一可以把手放在它身上的人。沃尔夫极为挑剔和专一，造访小屋的客人没有一个能够接近它。有人想要靠近，它就轻嗥一声；如果有人胆敢走得更近，它就会张开嘴，露出尖牙，轻嗥也会变成低吼——这种低吼非常可怕，胆子再大的人也会望而生畏，而那些听过狗吠，没听过狼嚎的农夫的草狗，听到这种声音也是吓得要命。","But at last, after a futile year of flight, he accepted the inevitable and elected to remain at the cottage where first he had killed the rabbit and slept by the spring.Even after that, a long time elapsed before the man and woman succeeded in patting him.It was a great victory, for they alone were allowed to put hands on him.He was fastidiously exclusive, and no guest at the cottage ever succeeded in making up to him.A low growl greeted such approach; if any one had the hardihood to come nearer, the lips lifted, the naked fangs appeared, and the growl became a snarl—a snarl so terrible and malignant that it awed the stoutest of them, as it likewise awed the farmers’ dogs that knew ordinary dog-snarling, but had never seen wolf-snarling before."
"无人知晓它先前的经历。它自从跟了沃尔特和马奇，才算开始了故事。它从南方跑来，显然是从某人那里逃出来的，但欧文和马奇找不到任何有关它旧主人的线索。给他们提供牛奶的邻居约翰逊太太认定这是一条克朗代克狗。她的哥哥正在那个遥远的地方挖矿，在这件事上她的话无疑相当权威。","He was without antecedents.His history began with Walt and Madge.He had come up from the south, but never a clew did they get of the owner from whom he had evidently fled.Mrs. Johnson, their nearest neighbor and the one who supplied them with milk, proclaimed him a Klondike dog.Her brother was burrowing for frozen pay-streaks in that far country, and so she constituted herself an authority on the subject."
"他们倒没有跟她争论这个问题。它耳朵上有些部位显然在某个时候受过严重的冻伤，不可能彻底痊愈了。而且，它看起来像在杂志上见过的阿拉斯加狗的图片。他们时常猜测它的过去，根据他们读来和听来的故事想象它过去在北方的生活。他们知道，北方还是让它魂牵梦萦的；晚上，有时候他们能听见它轻轻地哭泣；当北风刮过、霜雪满天的时候，它就会变得异常不安，发出一阵悲伤的、狼嚎一般的叫声。但它从来都不吠叫。没有什么刺激能让它发出那种狗的叫声。","But they did not dispute her.There were the tips of Wolf’s ears, obviously so severely frozen at some time that they would never quite heal again.Besides, he looked like the photographs of the Alaskan dogs they saw published in magazines and newspapers.They often speculated over his past, and tried to conjure up (from what they had read and heard) what his northland life had been.That the northland still drew him, they knew; for at night they sometimes heard him crying softly; and when the north wind blew and the bite of frost was in the air, a great restlessness would come upon him and he would lift a mournful lament which they knew to be the long wolf-howl.Yet he never barked.No provocation was great enough to draw from him that canine cry."
"沃尔夫归顺之后，它到底属于谁，欧文和马奇为此争了很长时间。两人都自称它的主人，都大声地表露对它的喜爱。起初，欧文占些优势，主要因为他是男的。很明显，沃尔夫没有陪伴过女性。它无法理解女人。马奇的裙子是它无法接受的东西。裙子发出的沙沙声总使它充满怀疑，要是遇上有风的天气，她简直无法靠近它。","Long discussion they had, during the time of winning him, as to whose dog he was.Each claimed him, and each proclaimed loudly any expression of affection made by him.But the man had the better of it at first, chiefly because he was a man.It was patent that Wolf had had no experience with women.He did not understand women.Madge’s skirts were something he never quite accepted.The swish of them was enough to set him a-bristle with suspicion, and on a windy day she could not approach him at all."
"另一方面，终究是马奇在喂养着它；而且，马奇掌管着厨房，只有经过她的同意，同时只要经过她的同意，它就能跨进那个神圣的地方。这样，她好歹挽回了在服饰上的劣势。接着，沃尔特还想更进一步，想让沃尔夫在他写作的时候习惯性地趴在他脚边。他花了许多写作的时间来爱抚沃尔夫，跟它沟通。沃尔特最终实现了这个目标。他之所以成功，多半还是因为他是个男的；马奇倒是很肯定地想，要是沃尔特将他的精力用到写诗和换钱上，任由沃尔夫自然地不带偏私地选择和判断的话，那他们已经多了一条四分之一英里长的潺潺的小溪，至少又有两股西风叹息着刮过他们的红杉林。","On the other hand, it was Madge who fed him; also it was she who ruled the kitchen, and it was by her favor, and her favor alone, that he was permitted to come within that sacred precinct.It was because of these things that she bade fair to overcome the handicap of her garments.Then it was that Walt put forth special effort, making it a practice to have Wolf lie at his feet while he wrote, and, between petting and talking, losing much time from his work.Walt won in the end, and his victory was most probably due to the fact that he was a man, though Madge averred that they would have had another quarter of a mile of gurgling brook, and at least two west winds sighing through their redwoods, had Wait properly devoted his energies to song-transmutation and left Wolf alone to exercise a natural taste and an unbiassed judgment."
"他们沿着山路缓缓下行，沉默了五分钟之后，沃尔特开口了：“那些八行两韵诗的稿费应该寄来了吧。邮局那里应该有张支票，我们就把它换成荞麦面，一加仑枫糖酱，再给你买双新的胶皮鞋。”","“It’s about time I heard from those triolets”, Walt said, after a silence of five minutes, during which they had swung steadily down the trail.“There’ll be a check at the post-office, I know, and we’ll transmute it into beautiful buckwheat flour, a gallon of maple syrup, and a new pair of overshoes for you.”"
"“还要约翰逊太太美妙的奶牛挤出来的美妙的奶。”马奇加了一句，“你知道，明天就是下个月了。”","“And into beautiful milk from Mrs. Johnson’s beautiful cow,” Madge added.“To-morrow’s the first of the month, you know.”"
"沃尔特不自觉地皱起了眉头；接着，他又满脸放光，拍了拍胸口的口袋。","Walt scowled unconsciously; then his face brightened, and he clapped his hand to his breast pocket."
"“没关系。我这儿还有头好奶牛呢，它可是加利福尼亚最好的奶牛了。”","“Never mind.I have here a nice beautiful new cow, the best milker in California.”"
"“你什么时候写的？”马奇迫不及待地问道。接着，她又抱怨起来：“你都没给我看过。”","“When did you write it?” she demanded eagerly.Then, reproachfully, “And you never showed it to me.”"
"“我攒着呢，就等着在去邮局的路上，找个美妙的地方读给你听，就像这儿。”他答道，同时手一挥，示意马奇在一根干木材上坐下。","“I saved it to read to you on the way to the post-office, in a spot remarkably like this one,” he answered, indicating, with a wave of his hand, a dry log on which to sit."
"一条小溪从茂密的蕨丛中流过，淌过布满青苔的岩石，穿过他们脚下的小道。山谷中传来云雀柔美的歌声，大黄蝴蝶在他们身边翻飞，在阳光和阴影中进进出出。","A tiny stream flowed out of a dense fern-brake, slipped down a mossy-lipped stone, and ran across the path at their feet.From the valley arose the mellow song of meadow-larks, while about them, in and out, through sunshine and shadow, fluttered great yellow butterflies."
"正当沃尔特在念手稿时，另一种声音传了过来。有人迈着沉重的脚步吱吱嘎嘎地走过来，时不时地踩到路上的碎石，声音就更响了。当沃尔特读完稿子，等着妻子赞赏的时候，路的拐角处走过来一个男人。他没戴帽子，满头是汗。一只手拿着手帕擦脸，另一只手拿着一顶新帽子，还有从脖子上取下来的浆过的领子，已经变得皱巴巴的了。他的体型很匀称，肌肉简直要撑破他那件极新的黑衣服。","Up from below came another sound that broke in upon Walt reading softly from his manuscript.It was a crunching of heavy feet, punctuated now and again by the clattering of a displaced stone.As Walt finished and looked to his wife for approval, a man came into view around the turn of the trail.He was bare-headed and sweaty.With a handkerchief in one hand he mopped his face, while in the other hand he carried a new hat and a wilted starched collar which he had removed from his neck.He was a well-built man, and his muscles seemed on the point of bursting out of the painfully new and ready-made black clothes he wore."
"“天气挺暖和啊。”沃尔特跟他打招呼。沃尔特很推崇乡间的淳朴，他也不会放过任何实践的机会。","“Warm day,” Walt greeted him.Walt believed in country democracy, and never missed an opportunity to practise it."
"那人停下脚步，点了点头。","The man paused and nodded."
"“我想我不大适应这种温暖的气候吧，”他略带歉意地解释说，“我更习惯于冰天雪地。”","“I guess I ain’t used much to the warm,” he vouchsafed half apologetically.“I’m more accustomed to zero weather.”"
"“这儿可找不到冰天雪地。”沃尔特大笑起来。","“You don’t find any of that in this country,” Walt laughed."
"“应该是没有吧，”男人回答道，“我也不是来找寒冷天气的。我来找我妹妹。说不定你知道她住哪儿。她叫约翰逊，威廉·约翰逊太太。”","“Should say not,” the man answered.“An’ I ain’t here a-lookin’ for it neither.I’m tryin’ to find my sister.Mebbe you know where she lives.Her name’s Johnson, Mrs. William Johnson.”"
"“你不会就是她在克朗代克的哥哥吧！”马奇叫了起来，眼里闪动着好奇，“我们听说过你好多事情呢。”","“You’re not her Klondike brother!”Madge cried, her eyes bright with interest, “about whom we’ve heard so much?”"
"“是，就是我。”他谦逊地答道。“我叫米勒，斯基夫·米勒。我觉得能给她一个惊喜。”","“Yes’m, that’s me,” he answered modestly.“My name’s Miller, Skiff Miller.I just thought I’d s’prise her.”"
"“这条路没错。只要沿着路走就行。”马奇站起来，指着四分之一英里外的山谷，为他指路道，“你看见那片枯萎的红杉树林没？走那条往右拐的小路。那条是去她家的近路。你一定找得到。”","“You are on the right track then.Only you’ve come by the foot-path.”Madge stood up to direct him, pointing up the canyon a quarter of a mile.“You see that blasted redwood?Take the little trail turning off to the right.It’s the short cut to her house.You can’t miss it.”"
"“好的，谢谢你，夫人。”他说。他似乎是想走，但是双脚笨拙地钉在了原地。他盯着她看，脸上露出毫不掩饰的爱慕之情，而他完全没有注意到自己的行为；他在挣扎，但尴尬还在升级，那份爱慕已经将他吞没了。","“Yes’m, thank you, ma’am,” he said.He made tentative efforts to go, but seemed awkwardly rooted to the spot.He was gazing at her with an open admiration of which he was quite unconscious, and which was drowning, along with him, in the rising sea of embarrassment in which he floundered."
"“我们还想听你聊聊克朗代克呢，”马奇说，“你在你妹妹家的时候，我们可以去拜访么？或者，你过来跟我们共进晚餐？那就更好了。”","“We’d like to hear you tell about the Klondike,” Madge said.“Mayn’t we come over some day while you are at your sister’s?Or, better yet, won’t you come over and have dinner with us?”"
"“好的，谢谢你，夫人。”他机械地嘟哝着。接着，他回过神来，又补充道：“我不会呆很久的。我还得再回北方去。就今晚的火车。我跟政府有邮递合同。”","“Yes’m, thank you, ma’am,” he mumbled mechanically.Then he caught himself up and added: “I ain’t stoppin’ long.I got to be pullin’ north again.I go out on to-night’s train.You see, I’ve got a mail contract with the government.”"
"马奇说实在是太遗憾了，而他又准备走，不过还是没迈动步子。他的目光无法离开马奇的脸。他沉浸在爱慕之中，忘记了尴尬；马奇也脸红了，觉得很不舒服。","When Madge had said that it was too bad, he made another futile effort to go.But he could not take his eyes from her face.He forgot his embarrassment in his admiration, and it was her turn to flush and feel uncomfortable."
"正在这个时候，沃尔特觉得应该说点什么来缓和一下局面，刚才还在灌木丛里钻来钻去的沃尔夫像狼一样小跑了过来。","It was at this juncture, when Walt had just decided it was time for him to be saying something to relieve the strain, that Wolf, who had been away nosing through the brush, trotted wolf-like into view."
"斯基夫·米勒对马奇的痴迷一下子就消失了。眼前的这个漂亮女人一下子移出了他的视野。他的目光全盯到狗身上去了，脸上露出极为惊讶的表情。","Skiff Miller’s abstraction disappeared.The pretty woman before him passed out of his field of vision.He had eyes only for the dog, and a great wonder came into his face."
"“啊，我真是该死啊！”他缓慢而严肃地清楚说出了这句话。","“Well, I’ll be damned!” he enunciated slowly and solemnly."
"他一下子跌坐在那根木材上，倒让马奇站着。听到他的声音，沃尔夫的耳朵垂了下来，高兴地张开嘴，像在笑一样。它慢慢跑到这个陌生人面前，闻闻他的手，接着又用舌头舔了舔。","He sat down ponderingly on the log, leaving Madge standing.At the sound of his voice, Wolf’s ears had flattened down, then his mouth had opened in a laugh.He trotted slowly up to the stranger and first smelled his hands, then licked them with his tongue."
"斯基夫·米勒拍拍狗的头，缓慢而严肃地重复道：“啊，我真是该死啊！”","Skiff Miller patted the dog’s head, and slowly and solemnly repeated, “Well, I’ll be damned!”"
"“夫人，请原谅，”随后，他接着说，“我只是有点吃惊，没别的意思。”","“Excuse me, ma’am,” he said the next moment “I was just s’prised some, that was all.”"
"“我们也很吃惊，”她轻声答道，“我们从没见过沃尔夫亲近一个陌生人。”","“We’re surprised, too,” she answered lightly.“We never saw Wolf make up to a stranger before.”"
"“你们管它叫——沃尔夫？”米勒问道。","“Is that what you call him—Wolf?” the man asked."
"马奇点点头。“但我不明白为什么它对你那么友好——除了因为你来自克朗代克。你也知道，这是一条克朗代克的狗。”","Madge nodded.“But I can’t understand his friendliness toward you—unless it’s because you’re from the Klondike.He’s a Klondike dog, you know.”"
"“是啊。”米勒心不在焉地说。他抬起沃尔夫的前腿，查看了一下脚垫，用拇指按了按，压了压。“有点软了，”他说，“它有好长时间没有走路了。”","“Yes’m,” Miller said absently.He lifted one of Wolf’s fore legs and examined the foot-pads, pressing them and denting them with his thumb.“Kind of SOFT,” he remarked.“He ain’t been on trail for a long time.”"
"“我说，”沃尔特插话说，“它肯听你摆布，真是神了。”","“I say,” Walt broke in, “it is remarkable the way he lets you handle him.”"
"斯基夫·米勒站了起来，不再是被马奇迷得神魂颠倒的样子，而是严厉而利落地问道：“你们拥有这条狗多久了？”","Skiff Miller arose, no longer awkward with admiration of Madge, and in a sharp, businesslike manner asked, “How long have you had him?”"
"而沃尔夫则在这个新来的人的腿上亲昵地蹭来蹭去，还张开嘴，吠叫了一声。这可真是石破天惊的一声，这一声短暂而欢快，但确实是狗的吠叫。","But just then the dog, squirming and rubbing against the newcomer’s legs, opened his mouth and barked.It was an explosive bark, brief and joyous, but a bark."
"“我都觉得挺新鲜。”斯基夫·米勒说。","“That’s a new one on me,” Skiff Miller remarked."
"沃尔特和马奇面面相觑。奇迹发生了。沃尔夫吠了一声。","Walt and Madge stared at each other.The miracle had happened.Wolf had barked."
"“这是它第一次吠叫。”马奇说。","“It’s the first time he ever barked,” Madge said."
"“这也我第一次听见它吠叫。”米勒主动说。","“First time I ever heard him, too,” Miller volunteered."
"马奇对他笑了笑，觉得这个人真是幽默。","Madge smiled at him.The man was evidently a humorist."
"“当然啊，”她说，“五分钟前你才见到它。”","“Of course,” she said, “since you have only seen him for five minutes.”"
"斯基夫·米勒严厉地看着她，怀疑她话中有诈。","Skiff Miller looked at her sharply, seeking in her face the guile her words had led him to suspect."
"“我以为你明白了，”他缓缓地说，“我以为你从它亲近我的举动已经恍然大悟了。它是我的狗。它不叫沃尔夫。它叫布朗。”","“I thought you understood,” he said slowly.“I thought you’d tumbled to it from his makin’ up to me.He’s my dog.His name ain’t Wolf.It’s Brown.”"
"“噢，沃尔特！”马奇本能地喊了一声丈夫。","“Oh, Walt!” was Madge’s instinctive cry to her husband."
"沃尔特马上警觉起来。","Walt was on the defensive at once."
"“你怎么知道它是你的狗？”沃尔特追问道。","“How do you know he’s your dog?” he demanded."
"“因为它就是。”回答就是这样。","“Because he is,” was the reply."
"“强词夺理。”沃尔特不乐意了。","“Mere assertion,” Walt said sharply."
"斯基夫缓慢而深沉地看着沃尔特，朝马奇点点头，接着问道：","In his slow and pondering way, Skiff Miller looked at him, then asked, with a nod of his head toward Madge:"
"“你怎么知道她就是你的妻子呢？你会说：‘因为她就是’，那我也可以说你是强词夺理。这狗就是我的。我喂它，养它，我想我应该知道这一点。看着，我证明给你看。”","“How d’you know she’s your wife?You just say, ‘Because she is,’ and I’ll say it’s mere assertion.The dog’s mine.I bred ’m an’ raised ’m, an’ I guess I ought to know.Look here.I’ll prove it to you.”"
"斯基夫·米勒转向那条狗。“布朗！”他的声音很短促，狗一听到这声音，耳朵马上垂下来，像受到了爱抚一样。“右转！”狗马上转向了右边。“直走！”狗立即停止转动，往前走去，一听到命令又顺从地停了下来。","Skiff Miller turned to the dog.“Brown!”His voice rang out sharply, and at the sound the dog’s ears flattened down as to a caress.“Gee!”The dog made a swinging turn to the right.“Now mush-on!”And the dog ceased his swing abruptly and started straight ahead, halting obediently at command."
"“我光吹口哨也行，”斯基夫·米勒骄傲地说，“它是我的头狗。”","“I can do it with whistles”, Skiff Miller said proudly.“He was my lead dog.”"
"“你不会要把它带走吧？”马奇问话的声音有些颤抖。","“But you are not going to take him away with you?”Madge asked tremulously."
"米勒点点头。","The man nodded."
"“回到可怕的克朗代克去受罪？”","“Back into that awful Klondike world of suffering?”"
"他点点头，又说：“那儿也不是那么糟糕。瞧瞧我。我很健康，是不是？”","He nodded and added: “Oh, it ain’t so bad as all that.Look at me.Pretty healthy specimen, ain’t I?”"
"“但是狗怎么办？严酷可怕的环境，令人心碎的艰辛、饥饿、风霜！噢，我看过有关的书，我知道怎么回事。”","“But the dogs!The terrible hardship, the heart-breaking toil, the starvation, the frost!Oh, I’ve read about it and I know.”"
"“有一次在小鱼河上，我差点吃了它，”米勒忧郁地主动说起来，“我要是没有抓住了那头驼鹿，它就死定了。”","“I nearly ate him once, over on Little Fish River,” Miller volunteered grimly.“If I hadn’t got a moose that day was all that saved ’m.”"
"“我宁愿死也不会那样做的！”马奇大喊起来。","“I’d have died first!”Madge cried."
"“在这儿，情况当然不一样了，”米勒解释道，“你不用吃狗。但在那儿，你的想法会完全不一样的。你没去过那儿，所以你什么都不知道。”","“Things is different down here”, Miller explained.“You don’t have to eat dogs.You think different just about the time you’re all in.You’ve never ben all in, so you don’t know anything about it.”"
"“这就对了，”马奇激动地争辩起来，“在加利福尼亚，狗不会被吃掉。为什么不让它留在这儿呢？它很快乐。它不缺东西吃——你知道的。它将不再挨冻，不再受苦。这儿的一切都温柔、亲切。人和自然都没有那么野蛮。它将不再知道皮鞭为何物。说到天气，这儿从来不下雪。”","“That’s the very point,” she argued warmly.“Dogs are not eaten in California.Why not leave him here?He is happy.He’ll never want for food—you know that.He’ll never suffer from cold and hardship.Here all is softness and gentleness.Neither the human nor nature is savage.He will never know a whip-lash again.And as for the weather—why, it never snows here.”"
"“不好意思，这儿的夏天热得像火烧。”斯基夫·米勒大笑起来。","“But it’s all-fired hot in summer, beggin’ your pardon,” Skiff Miller laughed."
"“但是你还没有回答呢，”马奇还是非常激动，“你在北方能给它什么呢？”","“But you do not answer,” Madge continued passionately.“What have you to offer him in that northland life?”"
"“粮食，只要我有，大多数时间是这样。”米勒回答道。","“Grub, when I’ve got it, and that’s most of the time,” came the answer."
"“剩下的时间呢？”","“And the rest of the time?”"
"“没有东西吃。”","“No grub.”"
"“工作呢？”","“And the work?”"
"“啊，好多活儿要干，”米勒不耐烦地脱口而出，“无休止的工作、饥饿、严寒，还有其他各种痛苦——这就是它跟着我所能得到的。但是它喜欢。它习惯了。它明白那种生活。它就是为那种生活而生的，也为此而长大。你对此一无所知。你不知道你在说什么。这狗就属于那个地方，在那儿它无比开心。”","“Yes, plenty of work,” Miller blurted out impatiently.“Work without end, an’ famine, an’ frost, an all the rest of the miseries—that’s what he’ll get when he comes with me.But he likes it.He is used to it.He knows that life.He was born to it an’ brought up to it.An’ you don’t know anything about it.You don’t know what you’re talking about.That’s where the dog belongs, and that’s where he’ll be happiest.”"
"“狗不会走的，”沃尔特坚决地说，“我们也没有必要接着谈下去了。”","“The dog doesn’t go,” Walt announced in a determined voice.“So there is no need of further discussion.”"
"“你说什么？”斯基夫·米勒追问了一句；他的眉毛低垂下来，倔强的性格使得他气血上涌，额头上都变红了。","“What’s that?”Skiff Miller demanded, his brows lowering and an obstinate flush of blood reddening his forehead."
"“我说狗不会走的，这事儿就结了。我不相信它是你的狗。你可能什么时候见过它。你甚至可能帮它的主人驱赶过它。它是服从阿拉斯加的驱赶口令，但这不能表明它就是你的狗。任何阿拉斯加狗都有可能像它那样服从你。而且，它无疑是一条很值钱的狗，狗在阿拉斯加都很值钱；这就足以解释你为什么竭力想占有它。不管怎么说，你得证明你有对它的所有权。”","“I said the dog doesn’t go, and that settles it.I don’t believe he’s your dog.You may have seen him sometime.You may even sometime have driven him for his owner.But his obeying the ordinary driving commands of the Alaskan trail is no demonstration that he is yours.Any dog in Alaska would obey you as he obeyed.Besides, he is undoubtedly a valuable dog, as dogs go in Alaska, and that is sufficient explanation of your desire to get possession of him.Anyway, you’ve got to prove property.”"
"斯基夫·米勒非常镇静，只是额头上倔强的血色又加深了一些，健硕的肌肉在黑色外套下膨胀；他将这位诗人上上下下打量了一番，好像是在估量他单薄的身躯能有多少力量。","Skiff Miller, cool and collected, the obstinate flush a trifle deeper on his forehead, his huge muscles bulging under the black cloth of his coat, carefully looked the poet up and down as though measuring the strength of his slenderness."
"这位克朗代克的来客现出一副不屑一顾的神情，最后说：“我看眼下这儿没有什么能阻止我带走这条狗。”","The Klondiker’s face took on a contemptuous expression as he said finally, “I reckon there’s nothin’ in sight to prevent me takin’ the dog right here an’ now.”"
"沃尔特的脸涨红了，臂上和肩上的肌肉似乎紧绷起来。他的妻子赶紧担心地介入进来。","Walt’s face reddened, and the striking-muscles of his arms and shoulders seemed to stiffen and grow tense.His wife fluttered apprehensively into the breach."
"“或许米勒先生是对的，”她说，“恐怕他就是对的。沃尔夫好像确实认识他，而且它确实对‘布朗’这个名字有反应。它马上跟他成了朋友，这可是从来没有过的事。而且，听听它那声吠叫。它是很开心才叫的，为什么开心？当然是因为找到了米勒先生。”","“Maybe Mr. Miller is right”, she said.“I am afraid that he is.Wolf does seem to know him, and certainly he answers to the name of ‘Brown.’ He made friends with him instantly, and you know that’s something he never did with anybody before.Besides, look at the way he barked.He was just bursting with joy Joy over what?Without doubt at finding Mr. Miller.”"
"沃尔特的肌肉松弛下来，他的肩头也有气无力地垂下来。","Walt’s striking-muscles relaxed, and his shoulders seemed to droop with hopelessness."
"“马奇，我想你说的对，”他说，“阿狼并不叫沃尔夫，而是叫布朗，它一定是属于米勒先生的。”","“I guess you’re right, Madge,” he said.“Wolf isn’t Wolf, but Brown, and he must belong to Mr. Miller.”"
"“或许米勒先生会卖了它，”她提示说，“而我们可以买过来。”","“Perhaps Mr. Miller will sell him,” she suggested.“We can buy him.”"
"斯基夫·米勒摇了摇头，他也不再显得挑衅，既然对方这么宽宏大量，他也就表现得宽宏大量。","Skiff Miller shook his head, no longer belligerent, but kindly, quick to be generous in response to generousness."
"“我有过五条狗，”他说，寻思着找个办法让他的拒绝不那么让人伤心，“它是头狗。它们是阿拉斯加最好的狗队。没什么能撵得上它们。１８９８年有人出五千美元，我都没有卖掉它们。那个时候，狗确实很值钱，但也不是所有的狗队都能卖到那么诱人的价钱。就我那队可以。布朗是那队里最出色的。那年冬天，有人出一千两百美元买它，我拒绝了。我当时没有卖，现在也不会卖。而且，这条狗对我来说意味着太多了。三年来我都在找它。发现它被偷走的时候，我难受极了——倒不是心疼它值多少钱，而是因为，不好意思，我实在太喜欢它了。就是这样。刚才看到它，我简直不相信自己的眼睛。我以为我在做梦呢。简直太好了，居然是真的。为什么呢，因为是我把它一手养大的。每天晚上，我把它抱到床上，搂着它睡。它的妈妈死了，我就用两美元一罐的炼乳喂它，而我自己在咖啡里都舍不得放一点。它只知道我就是它的妈妈。它经常吮我的指头，这个小东西——喏，就是这个指头！”","“I had five dogs,” he said, casting about for the easiest way to temper his refusal.“He was the leader.They was the crack team of Alaska.Nothin’ could touch ’em.In 1898 I refused five thousand dollars for the bunch.Dogs was high, then, anyway; but that wasn’t what made the fancy price.It was the team itself.Brown was the best in the team.That winter I refused twelve hundred for ’m.I didn’t sell ’m then, an’ I ain’t a-sellin’ ’m now.Besides, I think a mighty lot of that dog.I’ve ben lookin’ for ’m for three years.It made me fair sick when I found he’d ben stole—not the value of him, but the—well, I liked ’m like hell, that’s all, beggin’ your pardon.I couldn’t believe my eyes when I seen ’m just now.I thought I was dreamin’.It was too good to be true.Why, I was his wet-nurse.I put ’m to bed, snug every night.His mother died, and I brought ’m up on condensed milk at two dollars a can when I couldn’t afford it in my own coffee.He never knew any mother but me.He used to suck my finger regular, the darn little cuss—that finger right there!”"
"斯基夫·米勒有点激动得讲不出话来了，他伸出手指让他们看。","And Skiff Miller, too overwrought for speech, held up a fore finger for them to see."
"“就是这个指头。”他有点费劲地一字一句地说，好像这个手指就是他拥有所有权的证据，就是他和狗之间感情的纽带。","“That very finger,” he managed to articulate, as though it somehow clinched the proof of ownership and the bond of affection."
"马奇开始说话了，而米勒还兀自盯着自己的手指。","He was still gazing at his extended finger when Madge began to speak."
"“但是狗，”她说，“你从来没有为狗考虑过。”","“But the dog,” she said.“You haven’t considered the dog.”"
"斯基夫·米勒看上去有些不解。","Skiff Miller looked puzzled."
"“你为它想过吗？”她问道。","“Have you thought about him?” she asked."
"“不知道你要说什么。”米勒回答道。","“Don’t know what you’re drivin’ at,” was the response."
"“或许在这件事情上狗也有选择权的，”马奇接着说，“或许它有它的喜好和愿望。你没有考虑过它。你没有让它选。你从来不曾设想过，有可能它更喜欢加利福尼亚，胜过阿拉斯加。你只想过你喜欢什么。你对待它，就跟对待一袋土豆或是一捆干草一样。”","“Maybe the dog has some choice in the matter,” Madge went on.“Maybe he has his likes and desires.You have not considered him.You give him no choice.It has never entered your mind that possibly he might prefer California to Alaska.You consider only what you like.You do with him as you would with a sack of potatoes or a bale of hay.”"
"这是一个新的视角，米勒看上去很受触动，他自己在脑中思考着这个问题。他犹豫不决的时候，马奇乘胜追击。","This was a new way of looking at it, and Miller was visibly impressed as he debated it in his mind.Madge took advantage of his indecision."
"“如果你真的喜欢它，它的幸福也就是你的幸福。”她趁机说。","“If you really love him, what would be happiness to him would be your happiness also,” she urged."
"斯基夫·米勒还在做着心理斗争，马奇则喜不自禁地瞥了一眼丈夫，丈夫在她背后投去赞许的目光。","Skiff Miller continued to debate with himself, and Madge stole a glance of exultation to her husband, who looked back warm approval."
"“你怎么想？”克朗代克来客突然问道。","“What do you think?” the Klondiker suddenly demanded."
"这下轮到她迷惑不解了。“你说什么意思？”她问道。","It was her turn to be puzzled.“What do you mean?” she asked."
"“你觉得它会呆在加利福尼亚？”","“D’ye think he’d sooner stay in California?”"
"她很肯定地点点头。“我很肯定。”","She nodded her head with positiveness.“I am sure of it.”"
"斯基夫·米勒又开始心理斗争了，不过这次他说出来了，同时公正地盯着这只他们争论不已的狗。","Skiff Miller again debated with himself, though this time aloud, at the same time running his gaze in a judicial way over the mooted animal."
"“它干活儿很棒。它为我干了好多好多活儿。它从不吃白食，而且是个训练狗队的能手。它有头脑。除了说话，它什么都能干。它知道你在说什么。看看吧，它知道我们在谈论它。”","“He was a good worker.He’s done a heap of work for me.He never loafed on me, an’ he was a joe-dandy at hammerin’ a raw team into shape.He’s got a head on him.He can do everything but talk.He knows what you say to him.Look at ’m now.He knows we’re talkin’ about him.”"
"狗正趴在斯基夫·米勒的脚边，头贴在脚爪上，两只耳朵竖得笔直，仔细听着，眼睛随着他们接连说话的声音飞快而热切地转动着。","The dog was lying at Skiff Miller’s feet, head close down on paws, ears erect and listening, and eyes that were quick and eager to follow the sound of speech as it fell from the lips of first one and then the other."
"“它还有好多活儿要干呢。以后的日子它还是会干得很好的。我真的喜欢它。我快要爱死它了。”","“An’ there’s a lot of work in ’m yet.He’s good for years to come.An’ I do like him.I like him like hell.”"
"之后，斯基夫·米勒又张了一两次嘴，却欲言又止。最后，他说：","Once or twice after that Skiff Miller opened his mouth and closed it again without speaking.Finally he said:"
"“告诉你们我准备怎么做吧。夫人，你说的话有些道理。这狗工作得太辛苦了，或许它找到了一个安逸的窝，它也有权去选择。反正，我们把这事交给它去决定吧。它打算怎样，都依它。你们俩就好好坐在这儿。我跟你们道别，然后很平常地走开。它要是想留下，就让它留下。它要是想跟我走，就让它跟来。我不会叫它跟来，你们也不要唤它回去。”","“I’ll tell you what I’ll do.Your remarks, ma’am, has some weight in them.The dog’s worked hard, and maybe he’s earned a soft berth an’ has got a right to choose.Anyway, we’ll leave it up to him.Whatever he says, goes.You people stay right here settin’ down.I’ll say good-by and walk off casual-like.If he wants to stay, he can stay.If he wants to come with me, let ’m come.I won’t call ’m to come an’ don’t you call ’m to come back.”"
"他突然疑心重重地看着马奇，又补充说：“你们要保证公平，不能等我转过身去就撺掇它。”","He looked with sudden suspicion at Madge, and added, “Only you must play fair.No persuadin’ after my back is turned.”"
"“我们会公平的。”马奇说，但是斯基夫·米勒打断了她的保证。","“We’ll play fair,” Madge began, but Skiff Miller broke in on her assurances."
"“我知道女人的行事手段，”他说，“她们的心很软。她们一受触动就愿意作弊，做手脚，出老千，谎话连篇——不好意思，夫人，我只是说一般的女人。”","“I know the ways of women,” he announced.“Their hearts is soft.When their hearts is touched they’re likely to stack the cards, look at the bottom of the deck, an’ lie like the devil—beggin’ your pardon, ma’am.I’m only discoursin’ about women in general.”"
"“我简直不知道怎么感谢你。”马奇的声音都颤抖了。","“I don’t know how to thank you,” Madge quavered."
"“我不知道你有什么要感谢我的，”他答道，“布朗还没有决定呢。我慢慢地走，你们不会介意吧？这样更公平一些，因为我走过一百码就拐过去了。”马奇同意了，又补充说：“我真诚地向你保证，我们不会做任何事来影响它。”","“I don’t see as you’ve got any call to thank me,” he replied.“Brown ain’t decided yet.Now you won’t mind if I go away slow?It’s no more’n fair, seein’ I’ll be out of sight inside a hundred yards.”—Madge agreed, and added, “And I promise you faithfully that we won’t do anything to influence him.”"
"“好吧，那我真要走了。”斯基夫·米勒用平常道别的口吻说道。","“Well, then, I might as well be gettin’ along,” Skiff Miller said in the ordinary tones of one departing."
"听到他声音的变化，沃尔夫马上抬起了头，米勒和马奇握手的时候，它更迅速地站了起来。它蹦了起来，将前爪搭在马奇的腰上，同时又去舔斯基夫·米勒的手。米勒和沃尔特握手的时候，沃尔夫又做了一遍，它把身子搭在沃尔特身上，舔着两人的手。","At this change in his voice, Wolf lifted his head quickly, and still more quickly got to his feet when the man and woman shook hands.He sprang up on his hind legs, resting his fore paws on her hip and at the same time licking Skiff Miller’s hand.When the latter shook hands with Walt, Wolf repeated his act, resting his weight on Walt and licking both men’s hands."
"“我敢说，它不知道要奔哪边去。”克朗代克来客说完这句话，就转过身去，缓缓向上走去。","“It ain’t no picnic, I can tell you that,” were the Klondiker’s last words, as he turned and went slowly up the trail."
"他走出了二十英尺，沃尔夫一直注视着，眼里充满渴望和期盼，好像是在等着这个男人折返回来。接着，沃尔夫发出一声短促的呜呜声，朝他跑了过去；追上他之后，它用嘴轻轻衔住他的手，温柔地拽他，想让他停下来。","For the distance of twenty feet Wolf watched him go, himself all eagerness and expectancy, as though waiting for the man to turn and retrace his steps.Then, with a quick low whine, Wolf sprang after him, overtook him, caught his hand between his teeth with reluctant tenderness, and strove gently to make him pause."
"米勒没有停下来，于是沃尔夫又跑回沃尔特·欧文坐着的地方，咬着他的衣袖，想拉他起来去追赶那个渐行渐远的人，但是又失败了。","Failing in this, Wolf raced back to where Walt Irvine sat, catching his coat-sleeve in his teeth and trying vainly to drag him after the retreating man."
"沃尔夫显得越来越焦躁。它恨不得能到处分身。它想要同时出现在两个地方，跟旧主人和新主人都厮守在一起，而他们的距离已经越拉越远了。它激动而不安地蹦来蹦去，扭来扭去，一会儿跑向这边，一会儿跑向那边；它心乱如麻，无所适从，想要两全齐美，却又无法兼顾，只能发出急促尖利的呜呜声，折腾得气喘吁吁。","Wolf’s perturbation began to wax.He desired ubiquity.He wanted to be in two places at the same time, with the old master and the new, and steadily the distance between them was increasing.He sprang about excitedly, making short nervous leaps and twists, now toward one, now toward the other, in painful indecision, not knowing his own mind, desiring both and unable to choose, uttering quick sharp whines and beginning to pant."
"它突然坐了下来，把鼻子对着天空，一张嘴猛烈地一开一合，越张越大。猛烈的开合还伴随着颈部一阵阵的痉挛，一次比一次剧烈，一次比一次严重。伴随着这些开合和痉挛，它的喉头也开始随着肺部呼出的气流而颤动起来，起初没有声音，接着就发出了调子极低的声响，可能是人类所能听到的最低沉的声音了。这好像是在神经和肌肉上为大声嚎叫做好了准备。","He sat down abruptly on his haunches, thrusting his nose upward, the mouth opening and closing with jerking movements, each time opening wider.These jerking movements were in unison with the recurrent spasms that attacked the throat, each spasm severer and more intense than the preceding one.And in accord with jerks and spasms the larynx began to vibrate, at first silently, accompanied by the rush of air expelled from the lungs, then sounding a low, deep note, the lowest in the register of the human ear.All this was the nervous and muscular preliminary to howling."
"它正要扯开嗓子大声嚎叫的时候，大开的嘴又闭上了，躁动停止了；它长久地笃定地看着那个渐行渐远的人。突然，它又掉过头来，同样笃定地看着沃尔特。这次哀求还是没有得到回应。它没有得到只言片语，哪怕是一个手势的指示，这让它完全不知道应该怎么办。","But just as the howl was on the verge of bursting from the full throat, the wide-opened mouth was closed, the paroxysms ceased, and he looked long and steadily at the retreating man.Suddenly Wolf turned his head, and over his shoulder just as steadily regarded Walt.The appeal was unanswered.Not a word nor a sign did the dog receive, no suggestion and no clew as to what his conduct should be."
"它往前一看，旧主人就要走到路的拐角处了，这让它又激动起来。它低啸一声跳了起来，突然又想到了什么主意，又转向了马奇。它一直忽视了马奇，但是现在，新旧两个男主人都不理睬它，只剩下她了。它走到她面前，把头偎依在她的膝盖上，鼻子轻轻地拱她的手臂——这是它讨好她惯用的一招。它退后一点，开始顽皮地打滚、扭动，蹦来蹦去，半倒立着，用前爪拍击着地面；它眼神魅惑、双耳贴服、尾巴摇动，用尽了浑身解数，只是想表达它没法说出的心里的想法。","A glance ahead to where the old master was nearing the curve of the trail excited him again.He sprang to his feet with a whine, and then, struck by a new idea, turned his attention to Madge.Hitherto he had ignored her, but now, both masters failing him, she alone was left.He went over to her and snuggled his head in her lap, nudging her arm with his nose—an old trick of his when begging for favors.He backed away from her and began writhing and twisting playfully, curvetting and prancing, half rearing and striking his fore paws to the earth, struggling with all his body, from the wheedling eyes and flattening ears to the wagging tail, to express the thought that was in him and that was denied him utterance."
"很快，它也放弃了这种招数。这些从没对它如此冷淡的人现在如此冷漠，让它非常沮丧。它得不到任何回应，得不到任何帮助。他们根本没有考虑它，他们就像死人一样。","This, too, he soon abandoned.He was depressed by the coldness of these humans who had never been cold before.No response could he draw from them, no help could he get.They did not consider him.They were as dead."
"它转过头去，默默地盯着旧主人的身影。斯基夫·米勒已经快走到拐角的地方了。下一刻就会看不到他了。不过他从未回头，只是一直向前走，缓慢而沉着，好像身后正在发生的事跟他没有一点关系似的。","He turned and silently gazed after the old master.Skiff Miller was rounding the curve.In a moment he would be gone from view.Yet he never turned his head, plodding straight onward, slowly and methodically, as though possessed of no interest in what was occurring behind his back."
"就这样，他走出了他们的视线。沃尔夫还在等着他再次出现。它一动不动地，静静地等了好长时间，好像变成了石头——一块满怀渴望和期盼的石头。它轻吠一声，还是等着。接下来，它慢慢地折回了沃尔特·欧文的身边。它嗅了嗅他的手，重重地趴下来，抬眼望着小路上空荡荡的拐角。","And in this fashion he went out of view.Wolf waited for him to reappear.He waited a long minute, silently, quietly, without movement, as though turned to stone—withal stone quick with eagerness and desire.He barked once, and waited.Then he turned and trotted back to Walt Irvine.He sniffed his hand and dropped down heavily at his feet, watching the trail where it curved emptily from view."
"小小的溪流淌过布满青苔的岩石，潺潺的水声似乎突然变大了。除了云雀的欢唱，再无别的声响了。大黄蝶静静地在阳光下飞舞，渐渐隐入了沉寂的阴影。马奇凝视着丈夫，眼中充满胜利的快意。","The tiny stream slipping down the mossy-lipped stone seemed suddenly to increase the volume of its gurgling noise.Save for the meadow-larks, there was no other sound.The great yellow butterflies drifted silently through the sunshine and lost themselves in the drowsy shadows.Madge gazed triumphantly at her husband."
"过了几分钟，沃尔夫站起来了。它的动作显得坚定而从容。它没有朝欧文和马奇看一眼。它的眼睛紧盯着那条小路。它已经做好了决定。两人也看出了这一点。就现在的情形来看，他们明白，最终的考验到了。","A few minutes later Wolf got upon his feet.Decision and deliberation marked his movements.He did not glance at the man and woman.His eyes were fixed up the trail.He had made up his mind.They knew it.And they knew, so far as they were concerned, that the ordeal had just begun."
"它开始小跑起来，而马奇也撅起了嘴，做出一个可以发出亲切呼唤的口型——她多想呼唤出来呀。但是她没有唤出来。她不由自主地看了一眼丈夫，而他正严厉地看着她。撅起的嘴唇松懈了，她非常轻微地叹了口气。","He broke into a trot, and Madge’s lips pursed, forming an avenue for the caressing sound that it was the will of her to send forth.But the caressing sound was not made.She was impelled to look at her husband, and she saw the sternness with which he watched her.The pursed lips relaxed, and she sighed inaudibly."
"沃尔夫的小跑变成了奔跑。它的步子越来越大。它一次都没有回过头，狼一样的尾巴竖直地立在身后。它飞快地闪过小路的拐角，再也看不见了。","Wolf’s trot broke into a run.Wider and wider were the leaps he made.Not once did he turn his head, his wolf’s brush standing out straight behind him.He cut sharply across the curve of the trail and was gone."
