"肉中刺","The Thorn in the Flesh"
"第一章","Chapter I"
"一阵风吹起，杨树林被吹得偶尔泛白，就像有一团火焰将它们吹飞起来了似的。　流云浮动，蓝天若隐若现。斑驳的阳光撒落在平坦的田野上，黑麦田和葡萄园笼罩在阴影里。远处，在蔚蓝天空的映衬下，大教堂直冲云霄，下面隐约可见梅斯市的屋舍聚拢在一起，好似一座山丘。","A wind was running, so that occasionally the poplars whitened as if a flame flew up them.The sky was broken and blue among moving clouds.Patches of sunshine lay on the level fields, and shadows on the rye and the vineyards.In the distance, very blue, the cathedral bristled against the sky, and the houses of the city of Metz clustered vaguely below, like a hill."
"椴树林旁的田野间，一座座兵营立在光秃坚硬的土地上。这一群营房是用波状铁皮制成的圆屋顶的临时营房，屋顶上茂盛地生长着士兵们种下的旱金莲。营地一侧是一片菜园，士兵们种下成排的淡黄色莴苣。营地后方是个偌大的操练场，土质坚硬，周边围着铁丝网。","Among the fields by the lime trees stood the barracks, upon bare, dry ground, a collection of round-roofed huts of corrugated iron, where the soldiers’ nasturtiums climbed brilliantly.There was a tract of vegetable garden at the side, with the soldiers’ yellowish lettuces in rows, and at the back the big, hard drilling-yard surrounded by a wire fence."
"下午的这个时候，兵营里空无一人，行军床均已叠起。士兵们懒洋洋地呆在椴树下，等待着操练的命令。巴克曼坐在树阴下的长椅上，花香浓郁腻人。地上散落着支离破碎的浅绿色的椴树花。他正在给母亲写每周一次的明信片。 巴克曼是个皮肤白皙、身材高挑、四肢灵活的帅小伙。他坐得真是纹丝不动，正努力地写着明信片。当他弯腰写明信片时，他的蓝色军服耷拉着，让他年轻的身材显得有些走形。他那晒得黝黑的手一动不动，不知如何下笔。“亲爱的妈妈”——明信片只寥寥地写了这几个字。然后，他机械地草草写道：“非常感谢您的来信和寄来的物品。我一切安好。我们正要去防御工事操练——”写到这里，他突然停住了，坐在那里，暂时不动了，忘却了周遭的一切，显然陷入了某种沉思。","At this time in the afternoon, the huts were deserted, all the beds pushed up, the soldiers were lounging about under the lime trees waiting for the call to drill.Bachmann sat on a bench in the shade that smelled sickly with blossom.Pale green, wrecked lime flowers were scattered on the ground.He was writing his weekly post card to his mother.He was a fair, long, limber youth, good looking.He sat very still indeed, trying to write his post card.His blue uniform, sagging on him as he sat bent over the card, disfigured his youthful shape.His sunburnt hand waited motionless for the words to come.“Dear mother”—was all he had written.Then he scribbled mechanically: “Many thanks for your letter with what you sent.Everything is all right with me.We are just off to drill on the fortifications—” Here he broke off and sat suspended, oblivious of everything, held in some definite suspense."
"他又看了一眼卡片。但他再也挤不出只言片语了。心有千千结，下笔无一字。他署上名，抬头看看，似乎担心有人注意到他的隐私一样。","He looked again at the card.But he could write no more.Out of the knot of his consciousness no word would come.He signed himself, and looked up, as a man looks to see if anyone has noticed him in his privacy."
"他蓝色的眼睛流露出一丝局促不安，嘴唇苍白，新长出来的浅色髭须在阳光下闪闪发光。他面容姣好，举止优雅，颇有几分女子气。但他不乏军人意识，好像对严于律己信奉不已，对投身军营服役也颇感满意。他的嘴角挂着一丝年轻人的狂妄自大，敏捷的身体也彰显着年轻人的胆大妄为，但现在，这些都被压制住了。","There was a self-conscious strain in his blue eyes, and a pallor about his mouth, where the young, fair moustache glistened.He was almost girlish in his good looks and his grace.But he had something of military consciousness, as if he believed in the discipline for himself, and found satisfaction in delivering himself to his duty.There was also a trace of youthful swagger and daredevilry about his mouth and his limber body, but this was in suppression now."
"他将明信片放入紧身短上衣的口袋，走过去加入到他的那群战友中。他们懒洋洋地斜靠在树阴下，粗俗地谈笑着。今天，他没有参与其中。他靠近战友，只是想感受集体的温暖。有些东西占据着他的思绪。","He put the post card in the pocket of his tunic, and went to join a group of his comrades who were lounging in the shade, laughing and talking grossly.To-day he was out of it.He only stood near to them for the warmth of the association.In his own consciousness something held him down."
"不久，他们被召集列队。中士出来训话。他身材魁梧、体格健壮，年约四十。他的头向前突出，在强有力的双肩间略微下陷，结实的下颚寻衅似的翘起。但他双眼冒着火光，脸皮松弛地耷拉着，透着十足的醉意。","Presently they were summoned to ranks.The sergeant came out to take command.He was a strongly built, rather heavy man of forty.His head was thrust forward, sunk a little between his powerful shoulders, and the strong jaw was pushed out aggressively.But the eyes were smouldering, the face hung slack and sodden with drink."
"中士咆哮着发号施令，声音粗暴。这一小队士兵向前行进着，走出铁丝网围着的操练场，走上开阔的大道。他们步伐整齐，富有节奏感，扬起了一片尘土。　巴克曼夹在密不透风的四列战友之中前进。灼热、尘土和层层围裹令他几近窒息。 透过行进队列的空隙，他看到路边细小的藤蔓上布满尘埃，莠草间的罂粟花迎风摇曳，被风吹得七零八落，而远处的天空阳光明媚，旷野上空气清新。但他却将自己幽闭在暗无天日的焦虑之中。","He gave his orders in brutal, barking shouts, and the little company moved forward, out of the wire-fenced yard to the open road, marching rhythmically, raising the dust.Bachmann, one of the inner file of four deep, marched in the airless ranks, half suffocated with heat and dust and enclosure.Through the moving of his comrades’ bodies, he could see the small vines dusty by the roadside, the poppies among the tares fluttering and blown to pieces, the distant spaces of sky and fields all free with air and sunshine.But he was bound in a very dark enclosure of anxiety within himself."
"行进时，他和平常一样步履从容、矫健轻松。但他的身体在独自前行。他的精神游离在体外。随着这一小支队伍离小镇越来越近，这个年轻人心里越来越纠结，意识愈加游离在外。他的身体在机械思维的操控下运转着，心不在焉。","He marched with his usual ease, being healthy and well adjusted.But his body went on by itself.His spirit was clenched apart.And ever the few soldiers drew nearer and nearer to the town, ever the consciousness of the youth became more gripped and separate, his body worked by a kind of mechanical intelligence, a mere presence of mind."
"他们走下大路，成单列沿林间小径行走。林间满目苍翠、神秘静谧、树影斑驳、长草遍地、人迹罕至。他们走出树林，来到了阳光下的一条壕沟前。这条壕沟在土木工事脚下的深草花丛之间蜿蜒曲折，悄无声息；眼前的工事拔地而起，呈阶梯状，墙体表面光滑，但土质疏松，顶端长满了深草。茂盛的青草中，雏菊和杓兰泛出白色和金色的光，它们在防御工事安宁的环境中得以保存完好。周围丛林密布。偶尔一股神秘的风袭来，使覆盖土木工事顶端的花儿和深草摇曳低俯，像是在发出警报一般。","They diverged from the high road and passed in single file down a path among trees.All was silent and green and mysterious, with shadow of foliage and long, green, undisturbed grass.Then they came out in the sunshine on a moat of water, which wound silently between the long, flowery grass, at the foot of the earthworks, that rose in front in terraces walled smooth on the face, but all soft with long grass at the top.Marguerite daisies and lady’s-slipper glimmered white and gold in the lush grass, preserved here in the intense peace of the fortifications.Thickets of trees stood round about.Occasionally a puff of mysterious wind made the flowers and the long grass that crested the earthworks above bow and shake as with signals of oncoming alarm."
"士兵们站立于壕沟尽头，浅蓝配以深红的制服非常亮丽。中士正在下达指示。在这个人迹罕至、极度静寂的地方，他的声音显得尖锐而令人惊恐。士兵们虽然在听，却发现要想听明白并非易事。","The group of soldiers stood at the end of the moat, in their light blue and scarlet uniforms, very bright.The sergeant was giving them instructions, and his shout came sharp and alarming in the intense, untouched stillness of the place.They listened, finding it difficult to make the effort of understanding."
"指示完毕后，士兵们前去准备。阳光下，在壕沟的另一侧，壁垒突起，光滑明亮的墙面微微向后倾斜。　顶端碧草丛生，在墨绿色树梢的映衬下，雏菊像有魔力似的挺立着，显得异常高大。小镇的喧闹声和电车的奔驰声清晰可辨，但这些声音似乎不能穿透此处的宁静。","Then it was over, and the men were moving to make preparations.On the other side of the moat the ramparts rose smooth and clear in the sun, sloping slightly back.Along the summit grass grew and tall daisies stood ledged high, like magic, against the dark green of the tree-tops behind.The noise of the town, the running of tram-cars, was heard distinctly, but it seemed not to penetrate this still place."
"壕沟中的水静止不动。训练在无声无息间开始了。一名士兵携带云梯，穿过土木工事脚下的狭窄壁架，竭力在微倾的墙面寻找固定点，而他的身后就是壕沟的深水。他站在墙角，努力固定住梯子，显得渺小而孤立。终于，梯子固定住了，穿着肥大蓝色军装的身影开始笨拙地往上摸索着攀爬。其余的士兵则站立着观望。偶尔，中士吼出一声指令。渐渐地，笨拙的蓝色身影沿墙面越爬越高。巴克曼站着，看得心惊胆颤。这名士兵终于爬过墙面，到达了上面的平台，在鲜绿色的草丛间行走。他蓝色身影清晰可见。军官在下面一声大吼。这位士兵步履沉重地继续前进，找到另一个点将梯子固定住，然后小心翼翼地一级一级向下走。巴克曼看到在空中盲目探寻梯级的脚，他感到世界在他脚下塌陷。　士兵的身影紧贴墙面，畏手畏脚地向下摸索，恰似一只缺乏自信的虫子，正一步步往下挪，担心着每一个动作。终于，这名士兵大汗淋漓、神情紧张地安全着陆了，然后转身朝其他士兵走去。但他仍然动作僵硬，表情茫然机械，有些面无人色。","The water of the moat was motionless.In silence the practice began.One of the soldiers took a scaling ladder, and passing along the narrow ledge at the foot of the earthworks, with the water of the moat just behind him, tried to get a fixture on the slightly sloping wall-face.There he stood, small and isolated, at the foot of the wall, trying to get his ladder settled.At last it held, and the clumsy, groping figure in the baggy blue uniform began to clamber up.The rest of the soldiers stood and watched.Occasionally the sergeant barked a command.Slowly the clumsy blue figure clambered higher up the wall-face.Bachmann stood with his bowels turned to water.The figure of the climbing soldier scrambled out on to the terrace up above, and moved, blue and distinct, among the bright green grass.The officer shouted from below.The soldier tramped along, fixed the ladder in another spot, and carefully lowered himself on to the rungs.Bachmann watched the blind foot groping in space for the ladder, and he felt the world fall away beneath him.The figure of the soldier clung cringing against the face of the wall, cleaving, groping downwards like some unsure insect working its way lower and lower, fearing every movement.At last, sweating and with a strained face, the figure had landed safely and turned to the group of soldiers.But still it had a stiffness and a blank, mechanical look, was something less than human."
"巴克曼站在那里，心情沉重，好似被判罪了一样，等着轮到自己现丑。有些士兵很轻松地就完成了，毫不畏惧。　这只能说明这任务可以轻松完成，从而让巴克曼觉得更加苦涩。要是他也能那样轻松做到就好了。","Bachmann stood there heavy and condemned, waiting for his own turn and betrayal.Some of the men went up easily enough, and without fear.That only showed it could be done lightly, and made Bachmann’s case more bitter.If only he could do it lightly, like that."
"轮到他上场了。凭直觉，他知道没人明了他的处境。在军官看来，他只是一台机器而已。　他竭力坚持下去，表面上要做到有始有终。虽然内心纠结，但他还能控制得住。他拿起云梯，沿墙而行。他很快就成功地搁好了梯子，内心因感到希望而狂乱、震颤。然后，他开始盲目地往上爬。但是梯子固定得不是很牢靠，每一次梯子突然抖动，他都感到剧烈的晕眩，全身瘫软。他继续紧紧地握着。只要他能自己把握住，他就能完成任务。他痛苦地清楚这一点。他不能理解的是这狂热而无法解释的紧张。梯子每抖动一下，他就紧张一分，几乎使他身体散架，周身无力。一旦这种恐惧使他全身瘫软，他就完了。他拼命抓住梯子。他了解恐惧，他清楚恐惧的后果，他知道唯一的办法就是紧紧抓住不放手。他清楚这一切。然而，梯子一抖，他的脚踏空了，突如其来的恐惧向他的心腹袭来，让他变得愈来愈虚弱，在恐惧和失控中摇摇欲坠。","His turn came.He knew intuitively that nobody knew his condition.The officer just saw him as a mechanical thing.He tried to keep it up, to carry it through on the face of things.His inside gripped tight, as yet under control, he took the ladder and went along under the wall.He placed his ladder with quick success, and wild, quivering hope possessed him.Then blindly he began to climb.But the ladder was not very firm, and at every hitch a great, sick, melting feeling took hold of him.He clung on fast.If only he could keep that grip on himself, he would get through.He knew this, in agony.What he could not understand was the blind gush of white-hot fear, that came with great force whenever the ladder swerved, and which almost melted his belly and all his joints, and left him powerless.If once it melted all his joints and his belly, he was done.He clung desperately to himself.He knew the fear, he knew what it did when it came, he knew he had only to keep a firm hold.He knew all this.Yet, when the ladder swerved, and his foot missed, there was the great blast of fear blowing on his heart and bowels, and he was melting weaker and weaker, in a horror of fear and lack of control, melting to fall."
"但他还是摸索着慢慢越爬越高，脸一直拼命地注视着上方，但心里一直在惦记脚下的空间。他整个人，包括身心，都热得快要熔化了。他坚持不了了，急需释放。突然，他的心开始猛地一跳。他的心先是令人作呕地猛然下沉，接着升起来，然后又在恐惧中骤然下跌。他一动不动地贴在墙上，好似死了一般，一定不动，十分平静。只有内心深处的焦虑让他明白，一切远未结束。他还身处高空，紧贴着墙。但他努力的念头却差不多消失殆尽了。","Yet he groped slowly higher and higher, always staring upwards with desperate face, and always conscious of the space below.But all of him, body and soul, was growing hot to fusion point.He would have to let go for very relief’s sake.Suddenly his heart began to lurch.It gave a great, sickly swoop, rose, and again plunged in a swoop of horror.He lay against the wall inert as if dead, inert, at peace, save for one deep core of anxiety, which knew that it was NOT all over, that he was still high in space against the wall.But the chief effort of will was gone."
"他感到有点异样。他稍稍清醒了一些。怎么回事？这异样的感觉缓缓渗透着他。他的尿液顺着大腿流了下来。他呆在那里，紧贴墙壁不动，羞愧难当，下面依稀传来中士雷鸣般的咆哮。他仍然没动，在深深的羞愧中竭力使自己平静下来。他已然羞愧得无地自容了。之后，他可以继续往上爬了，因为他克服了自身的恐惧感。他的羞耻已然公之于众了。他必须继续。","There came into his consciousness a small, foreign sensation.He woke up a little.What was it?Then slowly it penetrated him.His water had run down his leg.He lay there, clinging, still with shame, half conscious of the echo of the sergeant’s voice thundering from below.He waited, in depths of shame beginning to recover himself.He had been shamed so deeply.Then he could go on, for his fear for himself was conquered.His shame was known and published.He must go on."
"他开始慢慢向上一梯级摸索，突然，周身感到一阵震颤。上面有人抓住了他的手腕，他被凌空拉起，拽向安全地带。一双大手将他像麻袋一样往上拉，他掠过土木工事的边缘，双膝落地，匍匐在草地上，为的是可以恢复自制力并站起来。","Slowly he began to grope for the rung above, when a great shock shook through him.His wrists were grasped from above, he was being hauled out of himself up, up to the safe ground.Like a sack he was dragged over the edge of the earthworks by the large hands, and landed there on his knees, grovelling in the grass to recover command of himself, to rise up on his feet."
"羞愧、茫然、深深的羞惭和屈辱使他精神崩溃、痛苦不堪。他站在那里，恨不得退缩到让自己完全消失。","Shame, blind, deep shame and ignominy overthrew his spirit and left it writhing.He stood there shrunk over himself, trying to obliterate himself."
"这时，将他拽上土木工事的军官出现在他眼前，气势逼人。他听见这位长者的喘息声，继而这声音如鞭子般猛烈地抽打着他的神经。他在羞愧的紧张状态下畏缩着。","Then the presence of the officer who had hauled him up made itself felt upon him.He heard the panting of the elder man, and then the voice came down on his veins like a fierce whip.He shrank in tension of shame."
"“抬头——向前看。”怒不可遏的中士吼道。而士兵机械地服从了命令，被迫直视着中士的眼睛。这位军官蛮横的、拉长着的脸触怒了年轻人。他集全身之力，在与军官的对视中让自己变得坚强。中士撕心裂肺的声音还在撕扯着他的肉体。","“Put up your head—eyes front,” shouted the enraged sergeant, and mechanically the soldier obeyed the command, forced to look into the eyes of the sergeant.The brutal, hanging face of the officer violated the youth.He hardened himself with all his might from seeing it.The tearing noise of the sergeant’s voice continued to lacerate his body."
"突然，他的头僵硬地往后一仰，心猛地一跳。那副嘴脸突然逼到他的眼前，扭曲得面目全非。他对他龇牙咧嘴、眼露凶光。恶言恶语扑面而来。他厌恶地闪到一边。随着一声尖叫，那副嘴脸再度袭来。出于自卫，他不知不觉抬起了手臂。当他发现自己的前臂重重击打在了军官脸上时，他吓得周身战栗。军官踉跄了一下，突然向后一转，伴着一声怪叫，他摇摇摇晃晃地向后摔下了防御土墙，双手还在空中乱抓着。瞬间的沉静后，传来一声落水的巨响。","Suddenly he set back his head, rigid, and his heart leapt to burst.The face had suddenly thrust itself close, all distorted and showing the teeth, the eyes smouldering into him.The breath of the barking words was on his nose and mouth.He stepped aside in revulsion.With a scream the face was upon him again.He raised his arm, involuntarily, in self-defence.A shock of horror went through him, as he felt his forearm hit the face of the officer a brutal blow.The latter staggered, swerved back, and with a curious cry, reeled backwards over the ramparts, his hands clutching the air.There was a second of silence, then a crash to water."
"看到这一幕，巴克曼惊得目瞪口呆。士兵们奔向事发地点。","Bachmann, rigid, looked out of his inner silence upon the scene.Soldiers were running."
"“你最好快溜。”他听到一个年轻激动的声音对自己说。凭直觉立刻做出决定后，他开始逃离现场。穿过绿树掩映的小径，他来到大路上，那里有电车进出小镇。内心里，他在为自己的脱逃辩解。他正在从军队和耻辱中解脱。他在远离这一切。","“You’d better clear,” said one young, excited voice to him.And with immediate instinctive decision he started to walk away from the spot.He went down the tree-hidden path to the high road where the trams ran to and from the town.In his heart was a sense of vindication, of escape.He was leaving it all, the military world, the shame.He was walking away from it."
"军官们骑着马在街上闲逛，士兵们沿着人行道行进。巴克曼来到桥边，站在桥上，小镇尽收眼底。低处，在水边平地上一栋栋别致的法式屋舍拔地而起，然后是一片参差不齐的屋顶和纵横交错的条条街道，高处是座黑色的大教堂，大教堂无数的塔尖直指天空，美不胜收。","Officers on horseback rode sauntering down the street, soldiers passed along the pavement.Coming to the bridge, Bachmann crossed over to the town that heaped before him, rising from the flat, picturesque French houses down below at the water’s edge, up a jumble of roofs and chasms of streets, to the lovely dark cathedral with its myriad pinnacles making points at the sky."
"他感到片刻的宁静，如释重负。于是，他转身沿河向公园走去。绿地上美丽的紫丁香树花团锦簇，成排的七叶树好似城墙，每一个边沿都有白花点缀，犹如圣坛一样明亮。军官们往来其间，举止高雅大方，衣着鲜艳；太太和小姐们在斑驳的树阴间漫步。这里真是美不胜收，他游走在幻境中，无拘无束。","He felt for the moment quite at peace, relieved from a great strain.So he turned along by the river to the public gardens.Beautiful were the heaped, purple lilac trees upon the green grass, and wonderful the walls of the horse-chestnut trees, lighted like an altar with white flowers on every ledge.Officers went by, elegant and all coloured, women and girls sauntered in the chequered shade.Beautiful it was, he walked in a vision, free."
"第二章","Chapter II"
"但他该去往何处呢？他开始从欣喜和自由中缓过神来。内心深处，他感到耻辱在体内不断灼烧。到目前为止，他都不忍去想它。但耻辱就是耻辱，是潜藏于意识之下的、赤裸裸的、不断灼烧着的奇耻大辱。","But where was he going?He began to come out of his trance of delight and liberty.Deep within him he felt the steady burning of shame in the flesh.As yet he could not bear to think of it.But there it was, submerged beneath his attention, the raw, steady-burning shame."
"他应当理智些。到现在，他还不敢想自己刚做过的事。他只知道必须摆脱，摆脱一切干系。","It behoved him to be intelligent.As yet he dared not remember what he had done.He only knew the need to get away, away from everything he had been in contact with."
"但怎么才能做到呢？一阵巨大的恐惧席卷他的全身。他不能忍受自己的受辱之身再次被置于权势的股掌之间。那双手曾左右着他，野蛮地让他一丝不挂，撕裂了他的羞耻心，让他失去了自控。","But how?A great pang of fear went through him.He could not bear his shamed flesh to be put again between the hands of authority.Already the hands had been laid upon him, brutally upon his nakedness, ripping open his shame and making him maimed, crippled in his own control."
"恐惧变成了一种痛苦。他几乎是盲目地转身朝军营走去。他不能独自承受这一切。他必须找人分忧。随后，怀着难以抑制的希望，他想到了自己的心上人，这个想法一直萦绕着他。他可以让她为自己分忧。","Fear became an anguish.Almost blindly he was turning in the direction of the barracks.He could not take the responsibility of himself.He must give himself up to someone.Then his heart, obstinate in hope, became obsessed with the idea of his sweetheart.He would make himself her responsibility."
"他鼓起勇气，畏畏缩缩地登上了出城朝军营方向疾驰的小电车。坐在车上，他纹丝不动、镇定自若。","Blenching as he took courage, he mounted the small, quick-hurrying tram that ran out of the town in the direction of the barracks.He sat motionless and composed, static."
"他在终点站下车，沿路往前走。风还在刮着。他听到黑麦地传来模糊的沙沙声；一阵强风袭来，黑麦地就发出更为响亮的嗖嗖声。周围不见一个人影。他感到孤单冷清、被人疏离，沿着低矮藤蔓之间的田间小径往前走。许多小藤蔓盘旋生长，绽出粉色嫩芽，卷须在风中摇曳着。他清楚地看到这一切，不禁感到惊奇。不远的地里，男男女女们正在收割干草。牛车停在路旁，男人们穿着蓝色衬衫，女人头上裹着白布；他们正将干草抱上车。在收割后的亮绿色田野的映衬下，一切显得明亮而清晰。他感到自己身处黑暗之中，注视着周围这迷人、灿烂、美丽的世界，而自己却不能置身其中。","He got out at the terminus and went down the road.A wind was still running.He could hear the faint whisper of the rye, and the stronger swish as a sudden gust was upon it.No one was about.Feeling detached and impersonal, he went down a field-path between the low vines.Many little vine trees rose up in spires, holding out tender pink shoots, waving their tendrils.He saw them distinctly and wondered over them.In a field a little way off, men and women were taking up the hay.The bullock-waggon stood by on the path, the men in their blue shirts, the women with white cloths over their heads carried hay in their arms to the cart, all brilliant and distinct upon the shorn, glowing green acres.He felt himself looking out of darkness on to the glamorous, brilliant beauty of the world around him, outside him."
"男爵的房子四平八稳地坐落在绿树、花园和田野间。埃米莉是男爵家的女佣。这是一座古老的法式田庄。军营近在咫尺。巴克曼朝院子走去，心里只有一个念头。他迈进宽敞遮阳的阴凉院子。院里的狗看见是个士兵进来，只是跳起来，呜呜叫着表示问候。一个水泵静静地立在角落里，在阴凉处的一棵椴树下。","The Baron’s house, where Emilie was maidservant, stood square and mellow among trees and garden and fields.It was an old French grange.The barracks was quite near.Bachmann walked, drawn by a single purpose, towards the courtyard.He entered the spacious, shadowy, sun-swept place.The dog, seeing a soldier, only jumped and whined for greeting.The pump stood peacefully in a corner, under a lime tree, in the shade."
"厨房的门开着。他犹豫片刻，然后进了厨房，腼腆地说了句话，勉强地笑了笑。两个女人吃了一惊，但是很高兴。埃米莉正在为下午的咖啡准备碟子。她站在桌子那头，停下手中的活，表情中含着惊讶、挑逗和欣喜。她的双眼骄傲、羞涩，就像某种野生动物，某种高傲的动物。她黑色的头发扎得紧紧的，灰色的眼睛定定地看着他。她穿着乡下式样的蓝色棉裙，上面饰有红色小玫瑰图案，胸前扣得紧紧的，掩着少女结实的乳房。","The kitchen door was open.He hesitated, then walked in, speaking shyly and smiling involuntarily.The two women started, but with pleasure.Emilie was preparing the tray for afternoon coffee.She stood beyond the table, drawn up, startled, and challenging, and glad.She had the proud, timid eyes of some wild animal, some proud animal.Her black hair was closely banded, her grey eyes watched steadily.She wore a peasant dress of blue cotton sprigged with little red roses, that buttoned tight over her strong maiden breasts."
"桌旁坐着另一名年轻女子。她是男爵家的保育员，正在一大堆樱桃中挑拣着，将挑出的樱桃丢进碗里。她年轻漂亮，脸上长着雀斑。","At the table sat another young woman, the nursery governess, who was picking cherries from a huge heap, and dropping them into a bowl.She was young, pretty, freckled."
"“好啊！”她快乐地说，“不速之客啊。”","“Good day!” she said pleasantly.“The unexpected.”"
"埃米莉一言不发。微黑的脸颊泛起了红晕。她仍站在那里看着，半是害怕，欲夺门而出；半是喜悦，舍不得离开。","Emilie did not speak.The flush came in her dark cheek.She still stood watching, between fear and a desire to escape, and on the other hand joy that kept her in his presence."
"“是的。”他局促不安地应答。两个女人的眼神仍然停留在他的身上。“我这次惹上大麻烦了。”","“Yes,” he said, bashful and strained, while the eyes of the two women were upon him.“I’ve got myself in a mess this time.”"
"“怎么啦？”保育员双手垂在膝上问道。埃米莉僵硬地站着。","“What?” asked the nursery governess, dropping her hands in her lap.Emilie stood rigid."
"巴克曼无颜抬头。他斜视那些灿烂如红宝石般的樱桃。他无法恢复常态。","Bachmann could not raise his head.He looked sideways at the glistening, ruddy cherries.He could not recover the normal world."
"“我把休伯中士从防御工事上打下了壕沟，”他说，“这是个意外——但是——”","“I knocked Sergeant Huber over the fortifications down into the moat,” he said.“It was an accident—but—”"
"不知不觉地，他抓起樱桃吃了起来，只听到埃米莉小声地惊叹了一下。","And he grasped at the cherries, and began to eat them, unknowing, hearing only Emilie’s little exclamation."
"“你把他从防御工事上打下去了！”赫西小姐重复着，大惊失色。“这是怎么回事？”","“You knocked him over the fortifications!” echoed Fräulein Hesse in horror.“How?”"
"他将樱桃核吐在手上，机械但专注地将事情经过讲给她们听。","Spitting the cherry-stones into his hand, mechanically, absorbedly, he told them."
"“啊！”埃米莉尖叫了一声。","“Ach!” exclaimed Emilie sharply."
"“你怎么到这儿来的？”赫西小姐问道。","“And how did you get here?” asked Fräulein Hesse."
"“我逃出来的。”他说。","“I ran off,” he said."
"继而是死一般的沉寂。他站起身，任由两个女人摆布。炉子上传来嘶嘶声，以及咖啡浓浓的香味。埃米莉迅速转过身去。在她俯向炉子时，他看到她平直的后背和结实的臀部。","There was a dead silence.He stood, putting himself at the mercy of the women.There came a hissing from the stove, and a stronger smell of coffee.Emilie turned swiftly away.He saw her flat, straight back and her strong loins, as she bent over the stove."
"“可是你打算怎么做呢？”赫西小姐问，有些吓呆了。","“But what are you going to do?” asked Fräulein Hesse, aghast."
"“不知道。”他说完又抓了些樱桃。他不再言语。","“I don’t know,” he said, grasping at more cherries.He had come to an end."
"“你最好回军营去。”她说，“我们会让男爵先生来处理这事情。”","“You’d better go to the barracks,” she said.“We’ll get the Herr Baron to come and see about it.”"
"埃米莉静静地、麻利地准备着碟子。她拾起碟子，站在熠熠生辉的瓷器和银器前，面无表情，等待他的回答。巴克曼仍然垂着头，面色惨白，十分固执。他无法忍受回去的结局。","Emilie was swiftly and quietly preparing the tray.She picked it up, and stood with the glittering china and silver before her, impassive, waiting for his reply.Bachmann remained with his head dropped, pale and obstinate.He could not bear to go back."
"“我想试试到法国去。”他说。","“I’m going to try to get into France,” he said."
"“不错，但他们会逮住你的。”赫西小姐说。","“Yes, but they’ll catch you,” said Fräulein Hesse."
"埃米莉用沉着、警惕的灰色眼睛注视着他。","Emilie watched with steady, watchful grey eyes."
"“我可以试试，只要我能躲过今晚。”他说。","“I can have a try, if I could hide till to-night,” he said."
"两个女人都明白他的想法。她们也都清楚这是徒劳的。埃米莉拿起碟子，走出了厨房。巴克曼依旧垂首而立。他内心感受到耻辱和无能在作祟。","Both women knew what he wanted.And they all knew it was no good.Emilie picked up the tray, and went out.Bachmann stood with his head dropped.Within himself he felt the dross of shame and incapacity."
"“你不可能逃得了。”保育员说。","“You’d never get away,” said the governess."
"“我可以试一试。”他答道。","“I can try,” he said."
"今天，他不能将自己置于军方的股掌之间。如果今天能逃过一劫，他们明天爱怎么处置就怎么处置吧。","To-day he could not put himself between the hands of the military.Let them do as they liked with him tomorrow, if he escaped today."
"他们都一言不发。他吃着樱桃。樱桃的颜色将年轻保育员的脸颊映得绯红。","They were silent.He ate cherries.The colour flushed bright into the cheek of the young governess."
"埃米莉回来准备另一个碟子。","Emilie returned to prepare another tray"
"“他可以藏在你房里。”保育员对她说。","“He could hide in your room,” the governess said to her."
"女孩往后退了一下。她容不得这种冒犯。","The girl drew herself away.She could not bear the intrusion."
"“这是我能想到的唯一不会被孩子们打扰的地方。”赫西小姐说。","“That is all I can think of that is safe from the children,” said Fräulein Hesse."
"埃米莉没有作声。巴克曼站着，等待两个女人做出决定。埃米莉不想与他关系过密。","Emilie gave no answer.Bachmann stood waiting for the two women.Emilie did not want the close contact with him."
"“你可以和我睡。”赫西小姐对她说。","“You could sleep with me,” Fräulein Hesse said to her."
"埃米莉抬眼看着年轻人，直接坦露出不可冒犯的神情。","Emilie lifted her eyes and looked at the young man, direct, clear, reserving herself."
"“你想那样吗？”她问道，强烈的处女情结不容他触犯。","“Do you want that?” she asked, her strong virginity proof against him."
"“是——是的——”他犹豫不决地说，彻底被耻辱摧垮了。","“Yes—yes—” he said uncertainly, destroyed by shame."
"她又低下头。","She put back her head."
"“好吧。”她喃喃自语。","“Yes,” she murmured to herself."
"她迅速装好碟子，走了出去。","Quickly she filled the tray, and went out."
"“但你不可能一个晚上就穿过边境。”赫西小姐说。","“But you can’t walk over the frontier in a night,” said Fräulein Hesse."
"“我可以骑自行车。”他说。","“I can cycle,” he said."
"埃米莉回来了，举止拘谨、态度矜持、不卑不亢。","Emilie returned, a restraint, a neutrality, in her bearing."
"“我看看是否一切妥当。”保育员说。","“I’ll see if it’s all right,” said the governess."
"片刻之后，巴克曼跟在埃米莉身后穿过方形大厅。大厅的墙上挂着巨幅地图。他看到挂钩上有件带铜纽扣的蓝色儿童外套，想起了自己曾坐在椴树下看男爵家最小的孩子牵着埃米莉的手学步的情形。这已经是很久以前的事了。那是一种他丢失已久的自由，如今取而代之的是迫在眉睫的焦虑。","In a moment or two Bachmann was following Emilie through the square hall, where hung large maps on the walls.He noticed a child’s blue coat with brass buttons on the peg, and it reminded him of Emilie walking holding the hand of the youngest child, whilst he watched, sitting under the lime tree.Already this was a long way off.That was a sort of freedom he had lost, changed for a new, immediate anxiety."
"他们胆怯地迅速登上楼梯，然后走过一条漫长的走廊。埃米莉打开房间门，他走了进去，一脸的羞愧。","They went quickly, fearfully up the stairs and down a long corridor.Emilie opened her door, and he entered, ashamed, into her room."
"“我得下去了。”她喃喃道，然后离开，轻轻合上了门。　","“I must go down,” she murmured, and she departed, closing the door softly."
"房间小巧洁净，没有什么家具。只有一个盛圣水的小碟，一幅圣心图，一个十字架，一个祈祷台。 小床上的白色床单一尘不染，一个洗手用的红陶土钵立在光秃秃的桌子上，还有一面小镜子和一个小五斗橱。仅此而已。","It was a small, bare, neat room.There was a little dish for holy-water, a picture of the Sacred Heart, a crucifix, and a prie-Dieu.The small bed lay white and untouched, the wash-hand bowl of red earth stood on a bare table, there was a little mirror and a small chest of drawers.That was all."
"在这个避难所里，他感到无比安全。他走到窗前，越过庭院，眺望着这午后灿烂的乡村。他将要离开这个地方，这种生活了。他已经身处在陌生之地了。","Feeling safe, in sanctuary, he went to the window, looking over the courtyard at the shimmering, afternoon country.He was going to leave this land, this life.Already he was in the unknown."
"他退回到房间里。这个天主教气息十足的小房间简朴、严肃得令人称奇，让他感到异样却有种归属感。他看着耶稣受难十字架。这个农民模样的、高瘦的耶稣是黑森林的一位农民雕刻的。巴克曼有生以来头一次将这个形像视之为人。它表现的是一个悬在绞架上的、于无助中受尽折磨的男人。他凝眸细看，似乎在寻觅新知。","He drew away into the room.The curious simplicity and severity of the little Roman Catholic bedroom was foreign but restoring to him.He looked at the crucifix.It was a long, lean, peasant Christ carved by a peasant in the Black Forest.For the first time in his life, Bachmann saw the figure as a human thing.It represented a man hanging there in helpless torture.He stared at it, closely, as if for new knowledge."
"难以平复的耻辱在他体内灼烧、闷燃。他无法振作起来。灵魂似乎出现了裂口。内心的羞耻感似乎取代了他的力量和男子气概。","Within his own flesh burned and smouldered the restless shame.He could not gather himself together.There was a gap in his soul.The shame within him seemed to displace his strength and his manhood."
"他在椅子上坐下。这种耻辱、这种公然受辱的感觉被激发了，作用于他的大脑，令他心情沉重，难以名状的沉重。","He sat down on his chair.The shame, the roused feeling of exposure acted on his brain, made him heavy, unutterably heavy."
"他心智全无，机械地脱下靴子、腰带和短上衣，搁在一旁，然后他沉沉地躺下了，陷入麻醉状的沉睡之中。","Mechanically, his wits all gone, he took off his boots, his belt, his tunic, put them aside, and lay down, heavy, and fell into a kind of drugged sleep."
"不一会儿，埃米莉进来看他。但他在沉睡。她见他躺在那里浑然不动，完全静止，她感到害怕。他的衬衫在颈部敞开着。她看到他洁白无暇的身体，非常干净、漂亮。他一动不动地睡着。他躺在那里，腿上穿着蓝色军裤，脚上套着粗布长袜，与她的床格格不入。她转身离开了。","Emilie came in a little while, and looked at him.But he was sunk in sleep.She saw him lying there inert, and terribly still, and she was afraid.His shirt was unfastened at the throat.She saw his pure white flesh, very clean and beautiful.And he slept inert.His legs, in the blue uniform trousers, his feet in the coarse stockings, lay foreign on her bed.She went away."
"第三章","Chapter III"
"她心神不宁，每一根神经都局促不安。她想洁身自好，不被任何人染指。一种狂热的本能使她在任何可能对她伸手的人面前退却。","She was uneasy, perturbed to her last fibre.She wanted to remain clear, with no touch on her.A wild instinct made her shrink away from any hands which might be laid on her."
"她是弃儿，可能是吉普赛人，在罗马天主教救济所长大。她是个天真的异教徒，从十四岁起就跟随男爵夫人，已为之服务了七年。","She was a foundling, probably of some gipsy race, brought up in a Roman Catholic Rescue Home.A naïve, paganly religious being, she was attached to the Baroness, with whom she had served for seven years, since she was fourteen."
"除了保育员艾达·赫西，她不与任何人来往。艾达是个精明、心地善良、不很直爽、喜欢卖弄风骚的人。她父亲是个贫穷的乡村医生。在与埃米莉的交往中，她们逐渐形成了一种同盟胜过依赖的关系，她不认为二人之间有等级差别。她们一起干活、唱歌、散步，一同去艾达的心上人弗朗兹·布兰德的住所玩。三人一起说笑，或是她们俩一起听林务员弗朗兹拉小提琴。","She came into contact with no one, unless it were with Ida Hesse, the governess.Ida was a calculating, good-natured, not very straight-forward flirt.She was the daughter of a poor country doctor.Having gradually come into connection with Emilie, more an alliance than an attachment, she put no distinction of grade between the two of them.They worked together, sang together, walked together, and went together to the rooms of Franz Brand, Ida’s sweetheart.There the three talked and laughed together, or the women listened to Franz, who was a forester, playing on his violin."
"两个年轻女人在她们的结盟中没有任何私密。埃米莉天性孤僻、内向含蓄、单纯自然。艾达把她当作权衡自己轻浮行为的砝码。但机灵狡猾的保育员总是忙于对付她的爱慕者，使出浑身解数改变埃米莉的鲜明个性，让她和男人发生点关系。","In all this alliance there was no personal intimacy between the young women.Emilie was naturally secluded in herself, of a reserved, native race.Ida used her as a kind of weight to balance her own flighty movement.But the quick, shifty governess, occupied always in her dealings with admirers, did all she could to move the violent nature of Emilie towards some connection with men."
"但这个皮肤微黑、简单质朴，却极其敏感的姑娘有着浓烈的处女情结。她路过时，若有粗俗的士兵在她身后发出长长的咂嘴飞吻的声音，她就血往上涌，怒不可遏。她憎恨他们近似揶揄的求婚。男爵夫人给予了她很好的保护。","But the dark girl, primitive yet sensitive to a high degree, was fiercely virgin.Her blood flamed with rage when the common soldiers made the long, sucking, kissing noise behind her as she passed.She hated them for their almost jeering offers.She was well protected by the Baroness."
"她对凡夫俗子的蔑视是不可言喻的。但她喜欢男爵夫人，敬重男爵。在为绅士服务时，她感到轻松自在。在为真正的先生、太太服务时，她整个性情都非常平和。在她看来，绅士有着某种神秘的品质，让她在服侍他们时感觉轻松与自豪。而那些粗俗的士兵则形同兽类，一无是处。她的愿望就是服侍他人。","And her contempt of the common men in general was ineffable.But she loved the Baroness, and she revered the Baron, and she was at her ease when she was doing something for the service of a gentleman.Her whole nature was at peace in the service of real masters or mistresses.For her, a gentleman had some mystic quality that left her free and proud in service.The common soldiers were brutes, merely nothing.Her desire was to serve."
"她自恃清高。每逢周六下午，她路过市政大楼，从窗户中看见士兵与俗气的姑娘跳舞时，冷冰冰的厌恶和愤怒就会占据她的心头。士兵们脱去腰带，敞开束腰短上衣，迈着舞步，衬衣从松垮的短上衣中显露出来。他们步伐粗野，脸孔扭曲着，大汗淋漓。他们粗糙的双手将粗俗的姑娘搂在腋窝下，拽着她们往自己胸口上贴，看到这些让她忍无可忍。她讨厌看到他们胸对胸地扭在一起，男人的腿下流地舞动着。","She held herself aloof.When, on Sunday afternoon, she had looked through the windows of the Reichshalle in passing, and had seen the soldiers dancing with the common girls, a cold revulsion and anger had possessed her.She could not bear to see the soldiers taking off their belts and pulling open their tunics, dancing with their shirts showing through the open, sagging tunic, their movements gross, their faces transfigured and sweaty, their coarse hands holding their coarse girls under the arm-pits, drawing the female up to their breasts.She hated to see them clutched breast to breast, the legs of the men moving grossly in the dance."
"夜晚在花园里，当她听到树篱另一端传来姑娘在士兵搂抱下发出性感的、含糊不清的喊叫时，她恼羞成怒，厉声叫道：","At evening, when she had been in the garden, and heard on the other side of the hedge the sexual inarticulate cries of the girls in the embraces of the soldiers, her anger had been too much for her, and she had cried, loud and cold:"
"“你们在树篱里干什么勾当？”","“What are you doing there, in the hedge?”"
"她真想鞭打他们一通。","She would have had them whipped."
"但巴克曼不是名粗俗的士兵。赫西小姐相中了他，并把他和埃米莉撮合在了一起。他年轻英俊，金发白肤，腰杆笔直，步履间带着一种无意识的、却又很明显的骄傲。并且，他家世代富有，经营农牧业。他父亲已故，时下，是他母亲掌管全部家财。但是任何时候，只要巴克曼想要一百英镑，都能如愿以偿。他和他的一个兄弟以造四轮马车为营生。他家经营村里的农场、铁匠铺和马车铺。他们之所以干活，只是因为这是他们所熟悉的生活方式。如果愿意的话，他们靠自己的财产就可以独立生活。","But Bachmann was not quite a common soldier.Fräulein Hesse had found out about him, and had drawn him and Emilie together.For he was a handsome, blond youth, erect and walking with a kind of pride, unconscious yet clear.Moreover, he came of a rich farming stock, rich for many generations.His father was dead, his mother controlled the moneys for the time being.But if Bachmann wanted a hundred pounds at any moment, he could have them.By trade he, with one of his brothers, was a waggon-builder.The family had the farming, smithy, and waggon-building of their village.They worked because that was the form of life they knew.If they had chosen, they could have lived independent upon their means."
"这样一来，感觉上他就是一名绅士了，尽管心智未开。他有足够的钱买任何东西。而且，他拥有单纯、良好的教养。埃米莉在他面前心旌动摇。因此，他成了她的恋人，她亦渴望拥有他。但她是个处女，很羞涩，需要被征服，因为她尚未开化，既不知道文明的生活方式，也不了解文明的意图。","In this way, he was a gentleman in sensibility, though his intellect was not developed.He could afford to pay freely for things.He had, moreover, his native, fine breeding.Emilie wavered uncertainly before him.So he became her sweetheart, and she hungered after him.But she was virgin, and shy, and needed to be in subjection, because she was primitive and had no grasp on civilized forms of living, nor on civilized purposes."
"第四章","Chapter IV"
"六点钟，有士兵来盘问：看到过巴克曼吗？赫西小姐很高兴在其中扮演一个角色，便回答道：","At six o’clock came the inquiry of the soldiers: Had anything been seen of Bachmann?Fräulein Hesse answered, pleased to be playing a rôle:"
"“没有啊，自打周日就没见过他——埃米莉，你呢？”","“No, I’ve not seen him since Sunday—have you, Emilie?”"
"“没有，我没见过他。”埃米莉说，她的笨拙被看成是忸怩。艾达·赫西意犹未尽，还问了些问题，继续她的表演。","“No, I haven’t seen him,” said Emilie, and her awkwardness was construed as bashfulness.Ida Hesse, stimulated, asked questions, and played her part."
"“休伯中士没有丧命吧？”她惊愕地大声问道。","“But it hasn’t killed Sergeant Huber?” she cried in consternation."
"“没有，他掉到水里了。但他受惊不小，一只脚撞到了壕沟的一侧。他现在在医院里。巴克曼处境很不妙。”","“No. He fell into the water.But it gave him a bad shock, and smashed his foot on the side of the moat.He’s in hospital.It’s a bad look-out for Bachmann.”"
"埃米莉感觉自己受到了牵连，无法逃脱干系了，便站在一旁观望。在应对这种管理体制时，她不再那么从容，这是一种她视之为神圣却无法理解的体制。她被置于尴尬的境地。巴克曼在她房里，她不再是忠于职守的、虔诚的信徒。","Emilie, implicated and captive, stood looking on.She was no longer free, working with all this regulated system which she could not understand and which was almost god-like to her.She was put out of her place.Bachmann was in her room, she was no longer the faithful in service serving with religious surety."
"这种处境让她难以承受。整个晚上她都身负重荷，难以为继。她要给孩子们喂饭，哄他们入睡。男爵夫妇将要外出，她得给他们略备些点心。男仆驾车回来后要吃晚饭。她一直无法忍受眼前的混乱，觉得罪责难免，却又茫然不知所措。她的命运应由高居其上的人主宰，她应做的就是唯命是从。但她现在却置身其外，脱离了这种控制，忧虑不安。不仅如此，这个男人，她的情人巴克曼，他是谁，是个什么样的人？在所有男人中，只有他行动变幻莫测。除了信仰以外，只有他让她觉得惊恐万分。噢，她原本希望他是个不温不火的情人，不像现在这般近在咫尺，将她逐出了自己的世界。","Her situation was intolerable to her.All evening long the burden was upon her, she could not live.The children must be fed and put to sleep.The Baron and Baroness were going out, she must give them light refreshment.The man-servant was coming in to supper after returning with the carriage.And all the while she had the insupportable feeling of being out of the order, self-responsible, bewildered.The control of her life should come from those above her, and she should move within that control.But now she was out of it, uncontrolled and troubled.More than that, the man, the lover, Bachmann, who was he, what was he?He alone of all men contained for her the unknown quantity which terrified her beyond her service.Oh, she had wanted him as a distant sweetheart, not close, like this, casting her out of her world."
"待到男爵夫妇离开，年轻的男仆外出寻欢时，她上楼来到巴克曼身边。他已经醒了，迷迷糊糊地坐着。他听到外面旷野里，战士们、他的战友们正随着六角手风琴低沉的伴奏，唱着关于日暮的忧伤歌曲。","When the Baron and Baroness had departed, and the young manservant had gone out to enjoy himself, she went upstairs to Bachmann.He had wakened up, and sat dimly in the room.Out in the open he heard the soldiers, his comrades, singing the sentimental songs of the nightfall, the drone of the concertina rising in accompaniment."
"“每当我去看孩子……从他眼中看见了他的妈妈……”","“Wenn ich zu mei... nem Kinde geh’… In seinem Au... g die Mutter seh’....”"
"但他现在却不能置身其中。唯有士兵的歌声中那有感于青涩的、未获满足的欲望的呐喊渗透进他的血液，隐隐刺痛着他。他垂着头，渐渐振作起来；他在另一个世界聚精会神地等候着。","But he himself was removed from it now.Only the sentimental cry of young, unsatisfied desire in the soldiers’ singing penetrated his blood and stirred him subtly.He let his head hang; he had become gradually roused: and he waited in concentration, in another world."
"一进门，见他一人独坐着热切地等待着，她为之一动，惊慌失措得好像要晕死了一样。待她缓过神来，一股激情喷涌而出，犹如烈焰将她烧成灰烬。他穿着裤子和衬衫，坐在床边。当她进来时，他抬起头看她，而她却避开了他的脸。她不忍看他的脸。但她还是走近了他。","The moment she entered the room where the man sat alone, waiting intensely, the thrill passed through her, she died in terror, and after the death, a great flame gushed up, obliterating her.He sat in trousers and shirt on the side of the bed.He looked up as she came in, and she shrank from his face.She could not bear it.Yet she entered near to him."
"“想吃点什么吗？”她问。","“Do you want anything to eat?” she said."
"“是的。”他答道。她在暮色中站立，和他共处一室，他只能听到她沉重的心跳。他看到她的围裙正好与他的脸齐平。她静静地站着，与他有段距离，似乎她会这样永远站下去。他备受煎熬。","“Yes,” he answered, and as she stood in the twilight of the room with him, he could only hear his heart beat heavily.He saw her apron just level with his face.She stood silent, a little distance off, as if she would be there for ever.He suffered."
"就像着了魔似的，她就那样一动不动地站在那里等待，若隐若现，而他则蜷缩着坐在床边。另外一种意念在他体内变得强烈，占了上风。她缓缓靠近，慢慢挪步，似乎全无意识。他的心剧烈跳动。他按捺不住了。","As if in a spell she waited, standing motionless and looming there, he sat rather crouching on the side of the bed.A second will in him was powerful and dominating.She drew gradually nearer to him, coming up slowly, as if unconscious.His heart beat up swiftly.He was going to move."
"当她走到足够近时，他以迅雷不及掩耳之势举起双臂，搂住了她的腰，在意念与欲望的指使下将她揽向自己。他将脸埋入她的围裙，感受到她柔软无比的腹部。她让他激情燃烧。他忘却了一切。耻辱和记忆在狂热的激情火焰中消失殆尽。","As she came quite close, almost invisibly he lifted his arms and put them round her waist, drawing her with his will and desire.He buried his face into her apron, into the terrible softness of her belly.And he was a flame of passion intense about her.He had forgotten.Shame and memory were gone in a whole, furious flame of passion."
"她十分无助。她双手震颤，哆嗦着在他头上合拢，把他的头更深地按向自己的腹上，周身随之颤抖。他双臂紧锁，双手包着她的臀部，感受到她的娇媚激起的火焰般的温暖。她感受到极度强烈的痛与乐，随之失去了意识。","She was quite helpless.Her hands leapt, fluttered, and closed over his head, pressing it deeper into her belly, vibrating as she did so.And his arms tightened on her, his hands spread over her loins, warm as flame on her loveliness.It was intense anguish of bliss for her, and she lost consciousness."
"等她清醒过来时，发现自己变得平和宁静、心满意足。","When she recovered, she lay translated in the peace of satisfaction."
"对于这种感觉她以前一无所知，也可能永远都不会知道。她内心充满无限的感激。而他就在她身边。他将她完全抱在怀里，出于敬重与感激的本能，她也更紧地抱了他一下。","It was what she had had no inkling of, never known could be.She was strong with eternal gratitude.And he was there with her.Instinctively with an instinct of reverence and gratitude, her arms tightened in a little embrace upon him who held her thoroughly embraced."
"他贴近她，恢复了元气，感觉很美满。她心满意足，颤抖着给予他短暂的小小拥抱，以示对他的认可，这激起了他无法抑制的自豪感。他们彼此相爱，融为了一体。她爱他，他得到了她，她把自己给了他。没错。他把自己给了她，他们融为一体、圆满完整了。","And he was restored and completed, close to her.That little, twitching, momentary clasp of acknowledgment that she gave him in her satisfaction, roused his pride unconquerable.They loved each other, and all was whole.She loved him, he had taken her, she was given to him.It was right.He was given to her, and they were one, complete."
"他们心里都暖洋洋的，脸上热烘烘的。他们再次起床，神情略显羞怯，但幸福让他们容光焕发。","Warm, with a glow in their hearts and faces, they rose again, modest, but transfigured with happiness."
"“我去给你弄点吃的。”她说，重又带着服侍他人的欣喜又踏实的神情；她做出一个略带敬意的、古怪的告别姿势，然后转身离开了。他坐在床边，感到如释重负、无拘无束，觉得又惊奇又幸福。","“I will get you something to eat,” she said, and in joy and security of service again, she left him, making a curious little homage of departure.He sat on the side of the bed, escaped, liberated, wondering, and happy."
"第五章","Chapter V"
"她很快就回来了，端着托盘，身后跟着赫西小姐。他坐在那里吃东西，金发白肤的，重现着往日的稚气。两个女人看着他，欣赏着他的自傲与不凡。埃米莉感到富有、美满。相比之下，艾达变得无足轻重了。","Soon she came again with the tray, followed by Fraulein Hesse.The two women watched him eat, watched the pride and wonder of his being, as he sat there blond and naïf again.Emilie felt rich and complete.Ida was a lesser thing than herself."
"“你打算怎么做？”赫西小姐不无嫉妒地问。","“And what are you going to do?” asked Fraulein Hesse, jealous."
"“我必须离开这儿。”他回答道。","“I must get away,” he said."
"但这话对他毫无意义。有关系吗？他已获得了内心的满足和自由。","But words had no meaning for him.What did it matter?He had the inner satisfaction and liberty."
"“可是你得有辆自行车。”艾达·赫西说。","“But you’ll want a bicycle,” said Ida Hesse."
"“是啊。”他说。","“Yes,” he said."
"埃米莉坐着一言未发，虽然隔着一段距离，但在情感上她已和他浑然一体了。她对自行车和逃跑的对话充耳不闻。","Emilie sat silent, removed and yet with him, connected with him in passion.She looked from this talk of bicycles and escape."
"他们讨论着出逃计划。但两人心里都明白，巴克曼应该和埃米莉在一起。艾达·赫西成了局外人。","They discussed plans.But in two of them was the one will, that Bachmann should stay with Emilie.Ida Hesse was an outsider."
"但计划还是安排好了。赫西的情人会拿出自行车，留在他有时值班的小屋里。巴克曼晚上去那里取车，然后骑到法国去。但三个人都紧张得心怦怦乱跳，努力地想着办法。他们激动不安得如坐针毡。","It was arranged, however, that Ida’s lover should put out his bicycle, leave it at the hut where he sometimes watched.Bachmann should fetch it in the night, and ride into France.The hearts of all three beat hot in suspense, driven to thought.They sat in a fire of agitation."
"之后，巴克曼将转去美国，埃米莉将去那里和他会和。然后，他们就将到达一片乐土了。一段佳话再度上演。","Then Bachmann would get away to America, and Emilie would come and join him.They would be in a fine land then.The tale burned up again."
"埃米莉和艾达不得不绕道前往弗朗兹·布兰德的住所。他们稍作辞别，起身离去。巴克曼坐在黑暗之中，听到夜幕中响起的归营号。这时，他记起写给母亲的明信片。他跟在埃米莉后面溜出来，将明信片交给她代为邮寄。他的神态有些漫不经心、自鸣得意，而她则神采奕奕，对他毫不怀疑。他又溜回避难所。","Emilie and Ida had to go round to Franz Brand’s lodging.They departed with slight leave-taking.Bachmann sat in the dark, hearing the bugle for retreat sound out of the night.Then he remembered his post card to his mother.He slipped out after Emilie, gave it her to post.His manner was careless and victorious, hers shining and trustful.He slipped back to shelter."
"坐在床边，他开始思考。他重温了那天下午发生的事，记起了自己的极度焦虑，因为他之前就清楚自己要攀登那墙壁必然会吓晕过去。想到这里，他仍然感到一阵耻辱袭上心头。但他自言自语道：“这又能怎样？我没办法，我做不到。只要登高，我就变得极度虚弱，我控制不了自己。”痛苦的记忆再度袭来，耻辱犹如烈焰喷涌而出。但他坐在那里忍耐着。他不得不忍耐、承认和接受这份耻辱。“尽管如此，我并不是懦夫，”他接着说，“我不畏惧危险。如果我生来就是如此恐高，被吓得屁滚尿流”——纠结于这一事实让他备受折磨——“如果生就如此，我也只有认命而已，就是这样。这不是我的全部。”他想到埃米莉，心满意足了。“我生为何人就是何人，由它去吧。”他这样想。","There he sat on the side of the bed, thinking.Again he went over the events of the afternoon, remembering his own anguish of apprehension because he had known he could not climb the wall without fainting with fear.Still, a flush of shame came alight in him at the memory.But he said to himself: “What does it matter?—I can’t help it, well then I can’t.If I go up a height, I get absolutely weak, and can’t help myself.”Again memory came over him, and a gush of shame, like fire.But he sat and endured it.It had to be endured, admitted, and accepted.“I’m not a coward, for all that,” he continued.“I’m not afraid of danger.If I’m made that way, that heights melt me and make me let go my water”—it was torture for him to pluck at this truth—“if I’m made like that, I shall have to abide by it, that’s all.It isn’t all of me.”He thought of Emilie, and was satisfied.“What I am, I am; and let it be enough,” he thought."
"在接受了自身的不足之后，他坐在那里边思考着，边等埃米莉回来告诉她。她终于回来了，说弗朗兹今晚没法准备好自行车。自行车坏了。巴克曼不得不再等上一天。","Having accepted his own defect, he sat thinking, waiting for Emilie, to tell her.She came at length, saying that Franz could not arrange about his bicycle this night.It was broken.Bachmann would have to stay over another day."
"他们都很高兴。埃米莉在兴奋好色的艾达面前显得不知所措，现在又回到了年轻人的身边。她因不习惯而感到痛苦，显得拘谨而高贵。但他用双手拥着她，脱去她的衣服，近似疯狂地享受着她无助的处女之身，这身体忍受着如此剧痛，却也深切地感到快乐。疼痛和羞怯让她泪眼朦胧，她将他越抱越紧，直到两人双双达到胜利的巅峰，都感到极大的满足。他们相拥而眠。他心满意足、安然平和地睡着了，而她也静静地贴在他身边。","They were both happy.Emilie, confused before Ida, who was excited and prurient, came again to the young man.She was stiff and dignified with an agony of unusedness.But he took her between his hands, and uncovered her, and enjoyed almost like madness her helpless, virgin body that suffered so strongly, and that took its joy so deeply.While the moisture of torment and modesty was still in her eyes, she clasped him closer, and closer, to the victory and the deep satisfaction of both of them.And they slept together, he in repose still satisfied and peaceful, and she lying close in her static reality."
"第六章","Chapter VI"
"早晨，从军营里传来军号声，他们起床望着窗外。她爱他的身体，高傲、白皙，可以主导她。而他也爱她的身体，轻柔娇嫩、魅力无穷。他们望着从翠绿的田野和成熟的庄稼地上冉冉升起的夏日里淡灰色的水汽。周边没有城镇，他们的视线最终落在夏日清晨的薄雾里。他们互相依偎着，思绪变得平静。军号声给他们带来了一丝焦虑。她被唤回到现实世界，去了解她虽不能理解却乐于为之服务的当权者的世界。但这召唤又与她渐行渐远。她已拥有了一切。","In the morning, when the bugle sounded from the barracks they rose and looked out of the window.She loved his body that was proud and blond and able to take command.And he loved her body that was soft and eternal.They looked at the faint grey vapour of summer steaming off from the greenness and ripeness of the fields.There was no town anywhere, their look ended in the haze of the summer morning.Their bodies rested together, their minds tranquil.Then a little anxiety stirred in both of them from the sound of the bugle.She was called back to her old position, to realize the world of authority she did not understand but had wanted to serve.But this call died away again from her.She had all."
"她下楼干活，整个人都发生了奇怪的变化。她现在身处自己的新世界之中，一个她从未想象过的世界，虽然这仅仅是个希望之乡。她在这个世界活动、生存。她将这个世界延伸到她的工作中。她超乎寻常地快乐、专注。她并非迫不得已地勉强干活。没有人对她发号施令，她就会自然而然地这样做。这是完美的自然流露，就像倾泻的阳光一样。她心随身动，活干得井然有序。","She went downstairs to her work, curiously changed.She was in a new world of her own, that she had never even imagined, and which was the land of promise for all that.In this she moved and had her being.And she extended it to her duties.She was curiously happy and absorbed.She had not to strive out of herself to do her work.The doing came from within her without call or command.It was a delicious outflow, like sunshine, the activity that flowed from her and put her tasks to rights."
"巴克曼坐着，正在忙于思考。他必须做好一切打算。他必须给母亲写信，让她必须将钱寄往巴黎。他将去巴黎，再由那里迅速前往美国。只能这样做。他得做好一切准备。潜入法国是最危险的一步。　他因充满期盼而激动不已。他今天得弄到前往巴黎的火车时刻表——他得考虑周全。发挥自己的全部才智让他感到美妙的乐趣。看起来这真是一场冒险。","Bachmann sat busily thinking.He would have to get all his plans ready.He must write to his mother, and she must send him money to Paris.He would go to Paris, and from thence, quickly, to America.It had to be done.He must make all preparations.The dangerous part was the getting into France.He thrilled in anticipation.During the day he would need a time-table of the trains going to Paris—he would need to think.It gave him delicious pleasure, using all his wits.It seemed such an adventure."
"过了今天，他就自由大逃亡了。他是多么渴望获得完全、绝对的自由啊。和埃米莉在一起，他已经战胜了自我。他已经克服了耻辱，开始做回自己。时下，他迫切想随心所欲地继续进行下去。他想成家，找份工作，无拘无束地度日；他想与她相伴，和她一起生活，这就是他的热切愿望。他浮想联翩，备受煎熬地度过了一个小时。","This one day, and he would escape then into freedom.What an agony of need he had for absolute, imperious freedom.He had won to his own being, in himself and Emilie, he had drawn the stigma from his shame, he was beginning to be himself.And now he wanted madly to be free to go on.A home, his work, and absolute freedom to move and to be, in her, with her, this was his passionate desire.He thought in a kind of ecstasy, living an hour of painful intensity."
"突然，他听到说话声和沉重的脚步声。他的心猛地一跳，随之静止不动。他被发现了。他一直都知道。他的整个身心都陷入了一种万籁俱寂的状态，死一般静寂，一切声音和生命都戛然而止。他呆若木鸡地站在卧室里，完全僵住了。","Suddenly he heard voices, and a tramping of feet.His heart gave a great leap, then went still.He was taken.He had known all along.A complete silence filled his body and soul, a silence like death, a suspension of life and sound.He stood motionless in the bedroom, in perfect suspension."
"埃米莉在厨房穿梭，忙着为孩子们准备早餐。这时，她听到沉重的脚步声和男爵的说话声。男爵正从花园走进来，穿着一套旧的绿色亚麻布外衣。他中等个头，动作敏捷、举止优雅，人有些古怪却不乏魅力。他的右手在普法战争中中过弹。如今，当他躁动不安时，这只手就会在身体一侧向下抖动，像是感觉疼痛似的。他正在和一名身板笔直的年轻中尉急促地交谈着。两名列兵像笨熊一样站在门道里。","Emilie was busy passing swiftly about the kitchen preparing the children’s breakfasts when she heard the tramp of feet and the voice of the Baron.The latter had come in from the garden, and was wearing an old green linen suit.He was a man of middle stature, quick, finely made, and of whimsical charm.His right hand had been shot in the Franco–Prussian war, and now, as always when he was much agitated, he shook it down at his side, as if it hurt.He was talking rapidly to a young, stiff Ober-leutnant.Two private soldiers stood bearishly in the doorway."
"埃米莉大惊失色、脸色惨白，直挺挺地站着，畏缩不前。","Emilie, shocked out of herself, stood pale and erect, recoiling."
"“好，如果你这样认为，我们可以看看。”男爵气急败坏地说。","“Yes, if you think so, we can look,” the Baron was hastily and irascibly saying."
"“埃米莉，”他转向女孩，问道，“你昨晚有没有把一张这个巴克曼寄给他母亲的明信片投在邮筒里？”","“Emilie,” he said, turning to the girl, “did you put a post card to the mother of this Bachmann in the box last evening?”"
"埃米莉僵直地站着，没有吭声。","Emilie stood erect and did not answer."
"“有没有？”男爵厉声问道。","“Yes?” said the Baron sharply."
"“有，男爵先生。”埃米莉不卑不亢地答道。","“Yes, Herr Baron,” replied Emilie, neutral."
"男爵受过伤的手在愤怒中急速地抖动。中尉靠上前，身板挺得更直了。他猜得没错。","The Baron’s wounded hand shook rapidly in exasperation.The lieutenant drew himself up still more stiffly.He was right."
"“你有没有这家伙的下落？”男爵问道，一双略显灰色的金黄眼睛怒视着她。女孩定定地回头看着他，默不作声，但她的整个灵魂都已赤裸裸地袒露在了他的面前。他一言不发地看了她两秒钟。然后，他恼羞成怒，默然转身离去。","“And do you know anything of the fellow?” asked the Baron, looking at her with his blazing, greyish-golden eyes.The girl looked back at him steadily, dumb, but her whole soul naked before him.For two seconds he looked at her in silence.Then in silence, ashamed and furious, he turned away."
"“上楼！”他不容反抗地对年轻军官厉声命令道。","“Go up!” he said, with his fierce, peremptory command, to the young officer."
"中尉以军人冷酷的自信向他的士兵发出命令。他们一行重步穿过大厅。埃米莉呆若木鸡地站在那里，她的生命戛然而止。","The lieutenant gave his order, in military cold confidence, to the soldiers.They all tramped across the hall.Emilie stood motionless, her life suspended."
"男爵大步流星地上楼，沿走廊前行，后面跟着中尉和列兵。男爵一把推开埃米莉房间的门，瞧见了巴克曼。他穿着衬衫和裤子站在床边，正对着门看着。他异常镇静。他的双眼迎着男爵怒火燃烧的目光。男爵抖动着他那只残手，继而归于平静。他定睛细看这个士兵的双眼。他看到同样裸露的灵魂，似乎他真的洞悉了这个男人。而这个男人孤立无助，因为被人赤裸裸地洞悉而更显无助。","The Baron marched swiftly upstairs and down the corridor, the lieutenant and the common soldiers followed.The Baron flung open the door of Emilie’s room and looked at Bachmann, who stood watching, standing in shirt and trousers beside the bed, fronting the door.He was perfectly still.His eyes met the furious, blazing look of the Baron.The latter shook his wounded hand, and then went still.He looked into the eyes of the soldier, steadily.He saw the same naked soul exposed, as if he looked really into the MAN.And the man was helpless, the more helpless for his singular nakedness."
"“哈！”他不耐烦地叫道，转身面向趋步上前的中尉。","“Ha!” he exclaimed impatiently, turning to the approaching lieutenant."
"中尉出现在门口。他的眼睛迅速扫视了一遍这个光着脚的年轻人。他认出这就是他要找的目标。他简短地命令他穿上衣服。","The latter appeared in the doorway.Quickly his eyes travelled over the bare-footed youth.He recognized him as his object.He gave the brief command to dress."
"巴克曼转身找衣服。他非常平静，沉默无语。他处在一个抽象的、静态的世界里。他几乎没有意识到，两位绅士和两名士兵正站着看他。他们是看不见他的。","Bachmann turned round for his clothes.He was very still, silent in himself.He was in an abstract, motionless world.That the two gentlemen and the two soldiers stood watching him, he scarcely realized.They could not see him."
"很快，他准备好了。他立正站好。但站好的只是他的躯壳。一种出奇的沉静、茫然，一种类似永恒的东西左右着他。他仍然忠实于自己。","Soon he was ready.He stood at attention.But only the shell of his body was at attention.A curious silence, a blankness, like something eternal, possessed him.He remained true to himself."
"中尉下令开步走。这一小列队伍迈着庄严的步伐谨慎地下楼，穿过大厅，来到厨房。埃米莉仰脸站立，一动不动，面无表情。巴克曼没有看她。他们相互心知肚明。他们不分彼此了。然后，这一小列队伍走出厨房，进入院子。","The lieutenant gave the order to march.The little procession went down the stairs with careful, respectful tread, and passed through the hall to the kitchen.There Emilie stood with her face uplifted, motionless and expressionless.Bachmann did not look at her.They knew each other.They were themselves.Then the little file of men passed out into the courtyard."
"男爵站在门口，看着那四个穿制服的身影穿过纵横交错的椴树林的阴影。巴克曼机械麻木地走着，仿佛行尸走肉一般。中尉冷冷地远远走着，两名士兵在旁边缓慢地费力行进。他们走出院子，进入明媚的晨曦中，渐行渐远，朝军营走去。","The Baron stood in the doorway watching the four figures in uniform pass through the chequered shadow under the lime trees.Bachmann was walking neutralized, as if he were not there.The lieutenant went brittle and long, the two soldiers lumbered beside.They passed out into the sunny morning, growing smaller, going towards the barracks."
"男爵转身进入厨房。埃米莉正在切面包。","The Baron turned into the kitchen.Emilie was cutting bread."
"“这么说，他昨天在这儿过的夜？”他问道。","“So he stayed the night here?”  he said."
"女孩望着他，但几乎视而不见。她太自以为是了。男爵从她视而不见的双眼中看见了她黑暗、赤裸的灵魂。","The girl looked at him, scarcely seeing.She was too much herself.The Baron saw the dark, naked soul of her body in her unseeing eyes."
"“你们是怎么打算的？”他问。","“What were you going to do?”  he asked."
"“他计划去美国。”她答道，声音平静。","“He was going to America,” she replied, in a still voice."
"“呸！你应该立即把他送回军营。”男爵怒吼道。","“Pah! You should have sent him straight back, ” fired the Baron."
"埃米莉站在那里，对他的说辞无动于衷。","Emilie stood at his bidding, untouched."
"“他现在算是完了。”他说。","“He’s done for now,” he said."
"但他无法忍受她眼神中透出的黑暗、深沉、赤裸的灵魂，在这种痛苦折磨下都几乎没有变化。","But he could not bear the dark, deep nakedness of her eyes, that scarcely changed under this suffering."
"“简直是个蠢才。”他一边重复着，一边愤然离去，准备做些他力所能及的事。","“Nothing but a fool,” he repeated, going away in agitation, and preparing himself for what he could do."
