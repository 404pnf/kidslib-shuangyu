"第一章 小说的意图与要素","Intention and Elements of Fiction"
"当夜色笼罩着外边的世界，穴居人空闲下来，围火坐定时，小说便诞生了。他因为恐惧而颤抖或者因为胜利而踌躇满志，于是用语言重现了狩猎的过程；他详细叙说了部落的历史；他讲述了英雄及机灵的人们的事迹；他说到一些令人惊奇的事物；他竭力虚构幻想，用神话来解释世界与命运；他在改编为故事的幻想中大大夸赞了自己。在高度发展的现代世界，穴居人炉边故事中的组成部分有许多都已经成为我们推论和研究的学科了——例如，历史学、文学、物理学、神学，以及心理学。我们发现在我们的小说里有许多原始的冲动在发挥作用。然而，我们发现它们并不是抽象地在发挥作用——像我们发现它们在心理学或哲学课本中那样——而是在人们现实生活的形象中发挥作用，像在小说或戏剧中那样。正如我们富于想象力地进入小说境界时那样，小说使我们扩大了经验，并使我们对于自我可能遭遇的情况增加了知识。小说是进行中的生活的生动体现——它是生活的一种富有想象力的演出，而作为演出，它是我们自我生活的一种扩展。","As soon as the cave man had leisure to sit around the fire while darkness covered the world beyond, fiction was born. In words, he relived, shivering with fear or gloating in victory, the events of the hunt; he recounted the past history of the tribe; he narrated the deeds of heroes and men of cunning; he told of marvels; he struggled in myths to explain the world and fate; he glorified himself in daydreamsm converted to narrative. In the sophisticated modern world, many of the elements involved in the cave man's fireside tales have led to branches of speculation and study—history, literature, physics, theology, and psychology, for instance—and we find in our fiction many of the original impulses at work. We find them at work, however, not in the abstract—as we find them in the textbook of psychology or philosophy—but in images of life in the process of being lived as in fiction or drama. Fiction, as we enter into it imaginatively, broadens our experience and increases our knowledge of the possibilities of the self. Fiction is a vital image of life in motion—it is an imaginative enactment of life—and, as such, it is an extension of our own lives."
"我们最好提醒自己，小说追溯到史前史，它体现了我们的某些最为深切的需要与利益，这是很恰当的。不过，还要提醒自己，小说经过多少年代，已经成为一种综合的艺术，正如西斯廷教堂中米开朗琪罗的壁画不同于史前洞穴中的动物绘画那样，它已不同于炉边故事，这也是很恰当的。","It is well to remind ourselves that fiction goes back to prehistory and that it embodies some of our deepest needs and interests. But it is well to remind ourselves, too, that fiction has, over the ages, become a complex art, as different from the fireside tale as Michelangelo’s frescoes in the Sistine Chapel are from the animal paintings in prehistoric caves."
"因此，让我们来探讨一下现代的实例及其组成要素。我们必须记住，随着世道的改变，小说也改变了，每一时代产生出自己的那种小说。更为重要的是，我们必须记住，虽然在我们的技术世界中，改变一般总被认为意味着进步，艺术世界中的改变（而小说基本上是一门艺术）则未必意味着进步；谁也不会认为最近的一部畅销书就一定比荷马的或莎士比亚的作品好。更为常见的是，我们预料到起伏不定，往往还有衰退。因此，我们在本书中探讨小说时，既涉及新的，也涉及老的，既涉及它们差异之处，也涉及它们类似之点。我们试图在可能范围内找出一些持续不变的原则。不过本书的主要目的不是叙述短篇小说的历史，而是加深我们对各种形式的小说的鉴赏，从而加深我们对小说的兴趣。","So let us consider modern practice and the elements that go into it. We must remember that fiction changes as the world changes, that each age produces its own kind of fiction. More important, we must remember that, though in our world of technology, change is generally taken to mean progress, change in the world of art (and fiction is primarily an art) does not necessarily mean progress; nobody would think that the last best seller is necessarily superior to Homer or to Shakespeare. More generally, we expect fluctuation, and sometimes decline. So in considering fiction here we are concerned with both the new and the old, with both their differences and their similarities. We are trying, insofar as possible, to find continuing principles. But our main purpose here is not to give a history of the short story. It is to deepen our understanding of, and consequently our pleasure in, the various forms of fiction."
"让我们首先看看我们一般同意称之为小说的所有作品中的三个基本要素：情节、人物和主题。","Let us begin by looking at three basic elements found in all the compositions that we generally agree to call fiction: action, character, and theme."
"003. 格拉米格纳的情人","003. Gramigna’s Lover"
"乔万尼·维尔加（意大利） 著","By Giovanni Verga"
"亲爱的法里娜，我现在寄给你的并不是一篇完整的小说，而是一篇小说的梗概。因此，它至少具有简洁、真实的优点——按现时的说法，它是一篇人类的记录。也许，这会引起你，以及那些想研究人心这部巨著的人的兴趣。故事是我在乡间小路上偶然听到的。我深信，与其要你从书本的字里行间，或者从作者的角度去探索它，还不如让你面对赤裸裸的事实。所以，我多少打算按照我听到的那样，用讲给我听的那些人的朴实而生动的语言来叙述它。简单的充满人性的事实，总会引起我们深思，它的价值就在于它永远是真实的，真诚的眼泪，兴奋激动，真情实感。种种激情交织在一起，以它们隐蔽、曲折，有时又似乎是互相抵触的方式融合、成熟、发展。这个神秘的过程在未来很长时期内还会构成一种心理现象的诱惑力，而这种心理现象正是现代科学分析试图极为精确地注意着的，我们则称之为小说的主题。今天的这篇故事，我仅仅讲个开头和结尾；对你，这已经足够了，或许有朝一日对其他的人也会很够了。","DEAR Farina, I’m sending you here not a story, but the outlines of a story. So it will have at least the merit of being brief, and of being true—a human document, as they say nowadays, interesting, perhaps, for you and for those who would study the great book of the heart. I’ll tell it you just as I picked it up in the lanes among the fields, more or less in the same simple and picturesque words of the people who told it to me, and you, I am sure, will prefer to stand face to face with the naked, honest fact rather than have to look for it between the lines of the book, or to see it through the author’s lens. The simple human fact will always set us thinking; it will always have the virtue of having really happened, the virtue of real tears, of fevers and sensations which have really passed through the flesh. The mysterious process by which the passions knot themselves together, interweave, ripen, develop in their own way underground, in their own tortuous windings that often seem contradictory, his will still constitute for a long time to come the attractive power of the psychological phenomenon which we call the theme of a story, and which modern analysis seeks to follow with scientific exactitude. I shall only tell you the beginning and the end of the story I am sending you today, but for you that will be enough, and perhaps one day it will be enough for everybody."
"如今，由于采用了不同的艺术方法，我们在艺术上取得了许许多多极其辉煌的成就。我们对细节比过去更为讲究、更为重视。为了使故事发展符合逻辑，我们情愿牺牲过去的艺术大师们凭着几乎是超人的直觉构思出来的悲剧性结局与心理危机的巨大效果。这样，我们就必然没有过去那么惊人，那么具有戏剧性，虽然也同样是劫数难逃的。我们即便不是太自卑，也是太谦虚了，不过我们在描写真实心理上的维尔加这封信的收信人。收获，将使未来的艺术同样获益匪浅。难道我们在研究感情方面，就永远不能达到这样一个尽善尽美的境界，使得进一步去考察人的内心世界成为没有必要的了吗？难道人类心灵的科学，这门新的艺术的硕果，就不能把想象力的种种源泉开发到这样的深度和广度，使得未来的小说和故事仅仅成为这种现象的各个不同事实的记载吗？","Nowadays we work out differently the artistic process to which we owe so many glorious works of art, we are more particular about trifles, and more intimate; we are willing to sacrifice the grand effect of the catastrophe, or of the psychological crisis, which was visioned forth with almost divine intuition by the great artists of the past, to the logical development, and hence we are necessarily less startling, less dramatic, but not less fatal; we are more modest, if not more humble; but the conquests in psychological truth made The recipient of Verga’s letter, in which form the story is cast by us will be not less useful to the art of the future. Shall we never arrive at such perfection in the study of the passions, that it will be useless to prosecute further that study of the inner man? The science of the human heart, which will be the fruit of the new art, will it not develop to such a degree and to such an extent all the resources of the imagination that the novels and stories of the future will merely record the various facts of the case?"
"同时，我也相信，当小说的各部分圆满地联结起来，使整个创作过程同人类感情的发展过程一样神秘莫测，小说的形式完美一致，小说的内容真实可信，小说的方法与存在如此 吻合，使小说具有真人真事的效果，不露一丝人工雕琢的痕迹，艺术作品似乎自行变得成 熟，一点儿不必依赖作者，就像自然事件那样本能地表现出来。到那时，小说就会获得 巨大的成功，就会成为所有艺术作品中最完美、最富有人性的创作。这样，在小说的各个现行形式中，我们就看不出任何构思的迹象，任何想象的幻影，任何吐出第一句话，如同造物主的命令那样的痕迹。小说像它应该也必须做到的那样，自成一种体裁。它像一尊巍然常存的铜像，经常洋溢着生活，而它的作者则以非凡的勇气把自己隐藏起来，消失在他的不朽著作之中。","But in the meantime I believe that the triumph of the novel, that most complete and most human of all works of art, will be reached when the affinity and the cohesion of all its parts will be so complete that the process of the creation will remain a mystery, a mystery as great as that of the development of the human passions; and that the harmony of its form will be so perfect, the sincerity of its content so evident, its method and its raison d être so necessary, that the hand of the artist will remain absolutely invisible, and the novel will have the effect of real happening, and the work of art will seem to have made itself, to have matured and come forth spontaneously like a natural event, without preserving any point of contact with its author; so that it may not show in any of its living forms any imprint of the mind in which it was conceived, any shadow of the eye which visioned it, any trace of the lips that murmured the first words, like the fiat of the Creator; let it stand by itself, in the single fact that it is as it must be and has to be, palpitating with life and immutable as a bronze statue, whose creator has had the divine courage to eclipse himself and to disappear in his immortal work. "
"几年前，人们在那儿沿着西莫内托河追捕一名强盗。如果我没记错的话，那是一个名叫格拉米格纳的家伙。这个名字和它所代表的那种莠草一样，受到人们的诅咒。它使全省的人一听到就恐怖万分。骑兵、步兵和民兵骑警队跟踪了他两个月，始终没有能逮住他：他孤身一人，却抵得上10条汉子。这棵莠草甚至扬言要扎下根来。再说，收获的季节即将来临，田野里堆满了一垛垛干草，沉甸甸的麦穗正催着人们去收割。虽然割禾的人们早已镰刀在手，但依然没有一个地主胆敢到自己的田里去一下，因为他们生怕碰上格拉米格纳蹲伏在垄沟里，两腿夹着枪，准备把第一个下田来窥探他的人的脑袋轰掉。人们因此怨声载道。省长于是把所有的警官、骑兵军官和民兵骑警队长全召集拢来，向他们训话，使他们全凝神静听。第二天，他们展开了全面行动：每条沟渠里，每堵石墙后，到处都布满了巡逻队、小股的武装人员和岗哨。他们通过电报传递消息，骑马、步行，日以继夜地追捕着他，就像去追赶一只可恶的野兽那样跑遍了全省。格拉米格纳一次次从他们手中溜掉。假如他们追赶得太近，他就用子弹回敬他们。在旷野，在村间，在农庄上，在小酒馆的树荫下，在俱乐部和大会堂里，格拉米格纳和这次疯狂的搜捕以及他的拼死的逃窜，成了人们唯一的话题。骑兵的马精疲力竭，倒了下去；民兵疲惫不堪，横七竖八地躺在马厩里；巡逻兵站着就打盹；只有他，格拉米格纳，永不感到疲乏，从不合眼打盹，他不停地逃窜，攀下悬崖峭壁，偷偷地溜过庄稼地，匍匐着爬过满是仙人掌的丛林，像一条狼似的从干涸的河床里脱身出去。在俱乐部和村里的门阶上，交谈的主要话题就是，被追捕的人在6月毒日晒得焦干的广阔平原上，必定会感到口干舌燥。闲聊的人们说到这个，不由得把眼睛睁得大大的。","Several years ago, down there along the Simoneto, they were in pursuit of a brigand, a fellow called Gramigna, if I’m not mistaken; a name accursed as the grass which bears it, and which had left the terror of its fame behind it from one end of the province to the other. Carabiniers, soldiers, and mounted militia followed him for two months, without ever succeeding in setting their claws in him: he was alone, but he was worth ten men, and the ill weed threatened to take root. Add to this that harvest time was approaching, the hay was already spread in the fields, the ears of wheat were already nodding yes! to the reapers who had the sickle already in their hand, yet none the less there was not a proprietor who dared poke his nose over the hedges of his own land, for fear of seeing Gramigna crouching between the furrows, his gun between his legs, ready to blow the head off the first man who came prying into his affairs. Hence the complaints were general. Then the Prefect summoned all the officers of the police, of the carabiniers, and of the mounted militia, and addressed a few words to them that made them prick up their ears. The next day there was a general upheaval: patrols, small bands of armed men, outposts everywhere, in every ditch and behind every dry stone wall; they drove him before them like an accursed beast across all the province, by day and by night, on foot, on horseback, by telegraph. Gramigna slipped through their hands, and replied with bullets if they got too close on his heels. In the open country,in the villages, in the farmsteads, under the bough shelter of the inns, in the clubs and meeting places, nothing was spoken of but him, Gramigna, and of that ferocious hunt, of that desperate flight; the horses of the carabiniers fell dead tired; the militiamen threw themselves down exhausted in every stable; the patrol slept standing; only he, Gramigna, was never tired, never slept, always fled, scrambled down the precipices, slid through the corn, ran on all fours through the cactus thicket, extricated himself like a wolf down the dry beds of the streams. The principal theme of conversation in the clubs, and on the village door steps, was the devouring thirst which the pursued man must suffer, in the immense plain dried up under the June sun. The idlers widened their eyes when they spoke of it. "
"那时，佩帕，利科迪亚的美貌姑娘之一，正打算和绰号叫“蜡烛”的邻居菲努结婚。他自己有一小块土地，马房里还有一头栗色的骡子。“蜡烛”是个个儿高高的小伙子，像太阳那样漂亮，他不用弯腰就能像一根柱子似的把圣玛格丽特的旗子高高擎起。","Peppa, one of the handsomest girls of Licodia, was at that time going to marry Neighbour Finu,""Tallow-candle"" as they called him, who had his own bit of land and a bay mule in his stable, and was a tall lad, handsome as the sun, who could carry the banner of Saint Margaret as if he were a pillar, without bending his loins. "
"佩帕的母亲因为女儿交上了好运，高兴得流下了眼泪。她花了好多时间去翻看新娘箱子里的嫁妆：全都是白色的四件一套，“可以和一个皇后媲美”，垂肩的耳环，能戴满十个手指的金戒指。她拥有的金子和圣玛格丽特一样多。婚礼就定在圣玛格丽特节举行，恰好在6月干草收获以后。每天晚上，“蜡烛”从田里归来，把骡子拴在佩帕家门口，然后进屋对她说，今年的收成好极了，假如格拉米格纳不来放火的话，那间打开了门正对着床的小谷仓，无论如何也放不下今年的收获。他觉得似乎还要等上一千年，才能让自己的新娘坐在骡背上他自己的身后，接回家去。","Peppa’s mother wept with satisfaction at her daughter’s good fortune, and spent her time turning over the bride’s trousseau in the chest, all white goods, and four of each, ""good enough for a queen,"" and earrings that hung to her shoulders, and golden rings for all the ten fingers of her hands; she had as much gold as St. Margaret herself, and they were going to get married just on St. Margaret’s day, that fell in June, after the hay harvest. Tallow candle left his mule at Peppa’s door every evening as he returned from the fields, and went in to say to her that the crops were wonderful, if Gramigna didn’t set fire to them, and that the little cornchamber that opened its gate door opposite the bed would never be big enough for all the grain this harvest, and that it seemed to him a thousand years, till he could take his bride home, seated behind him on the bay mule. "
"随后，在一个晴朗的日子里，佩帕对他说：“那头骡子你也用不着了，我现在不想结婚了。”","But one fine day Peppa said to him: ""You can leave your mule out of it; I’m not going to get married."" "
"可怜的“蜡烛”简真像遭了雷打似的。那个老女人听到自己的女儿回绝了村里最好的一门亲事，急得动手揪自己的头发。","Poor Tallow’candle was thunderstruck, and the old woman began to tear her hair as she heard her daughter turning down the best match in the village. "
"“我喜欢的是格拉米格纳，”姑娘对母亲说，“除了他，我谁也不嫁。”","""It’s Gramigna I care for,""the girl said to her mother,""and I don’t want to marry anybody but him."" "
"“啊！”母亲像一个女巫似的披散着花白头发，尖叫着满屋乱撞，“啊，这个魔鬼居然跑到这儿来迷惑我的女儿啦。”","""Ah!""The mother rushed around the house, screaming, with her grey hair flying loose like a very witch. ""Ah! that fiend has even got in here to bewitch my girl for me."" "
"“不，”佩帕回答说，眼神就像钢铁一般坚定，“不，他没来过这儿。”","""No,""replied Peppa, her eyes fixed and hard as steel.""No, he’s not been here."" "
"“你在哪儿见到他的？”","""Where have you seen him?"" "
"“我没见到过他，只是听人说起过他。可是，听呀！在我被烧死之前，我可以感觉到他就在这儿。”","""I’ve not seen him. I’ve heard about him. Hark, though! I can feel him here, till it burns me."" "
"尽管他们试图瞒住这件事，可村里还是议论纷纷了。那些原先因为丰产的麦田、栗色的骡子，以及不用弯腰就能举起圣玛格丽特大旗的那个漂亮小伙子而忌妒佩帕的主妇们，四处散布流言蜚语，说格拉米格纳和她夜晚在厨房里幽会，说她们有人看见他躲在床底下等等。可怜的母亲给在炼狱里涤罪的灵魂点了一盏灯，甚至神父也来到佩帕的家里，用自己的圣衣去碰她的心房，好把盘踞在她心头的那个格拉米格纳魔鬼驱赶走。她始终坚持说，自己确实连看也没看见过他，只是在晚上梦见过，早上起来嘴唇干裂，似乎她自己的身体也感到了他必然经受着的那种干渴。","It caused a great talk in the village, though they tried to keep it dark. The goodwives who had envied Peppa the prosperous cornfields, the bay mule, and the fine lad who carried St. Margaret’s banner without bending his loins, went round telling all kinds of ugly stories, that Gramigna came to her at night in the kitchen, and that they had seen him hidden under the bed. The poor mother had lit a lamp to the souls in Purgatory, and even the priest had been to Peppa’s house, to touch her heart with his stole, and drive out that devil of a Gramigna who had taken possession of it. Through it all she insisted that she had not so much as set eyes on the fellow; but that she saw him at nights in her dreams, and in the morning she got up with her lips parched as if she were feeling in her own body all the thirst he must be suffering. "
"因此，老女人只得把她关在家里，不让她听到任何有关格拉米格纳的议论。她甚至用圣像把门上的裂缝都遮挡住。佩帕站在圣像后面偷听着外面的街谈巷议，脸上红一阵、白一阵，好像魔鬼把一切痛苦都赶到了她面前。","Then the old woman shut her up in the house, so that she should hear no more talk about Gramigna, and she covered up all the cracks in the house Peppa listened behind the blessed pictures to all that was said outside in the street, and she went white and red, as if the devil were blowing all hell in her face. "
"最后，她听说格拉米格纳已经被赶进了帕拉戈马的仙人掌丛中。“他们交火了两小时，”主妇们说，“死了一个骑兵，三个以上的民兵负了伤。但密集的子弹像阵雨一样朝他射击。这会儿，他们在他待过的地方发现了一摊血。”","At last she heard say that they had tracked down Gramigna to the cactus thickets at Palagonia.-""They’ve been firing for two hours!""the goodwives said."" There bisnioenredcearda, and morethan three of the militia wounded. But they fired such showers of bullets on him that this time they’ve found a pool of blood, where he was."" "
"于是佩帕在老女人的床头对着自己身上画了一个十字，就从窗口逃出去了。","Then Peppa crossed herself before the old woman’s bed head, and escaped out of the window. "
"格拉米格纳藏在帕拉戈马的霸王树丛中，尽管身负重伤，十分痛苦，他们仍旧没能把他从野兔的藏身之地赶出来。两天来，他没吃过一点儿东西，脸色苍白，发着高烧，却仍然牢牢地握着枪，当他在朦胧的晨光中看见她穿过仙人掌丛，果敢地朝他走来时，他犹豫了一下，不知是否应该开枪——“你想要什么？”他问她，“你到这儿来干吗？”","Gramigna was among the prickly’pear cactuses of Palagonia, nor had they been able to dislodge him from that cover for rabbits, torn, wounded though he was, pale with two days fasting, parched with fever, and his gun levelled: as he saw her coming, resolute, through the thickets of the cactus, in the dim gleam of dawn,he hesitated a moment whether to fire or not. — ""What do you want?""he asked her.""What have you come here for?"" "
"“我来和你待在一起。”她对他说，眼睛坚定地望着他，“你是不是格拉米格纳？”","""I’ve come to stay with you,""she said to him, looking at him steadily. ""Are you Gramigna?"" "
"“是的，我是格拉米格纳。如果你是冲着这20个沾满血污的几尼来的，你可打错了算盘。”","""Yes, I am Gramigna. If you’ve come to get those twenty guineas blood made a mistake."" "
"“不，我是来和你待在一起的。”她回答道。","""No,I’ve come to stay with you,""she replied."
"“回去！”他说，“你不能和我待在一起，我不要什么人和我待在一起。如果你想来弄点钱，那你可找错了人啦！看见吗？我告诉你，我身无分文！两天来我连一片面包也没吃过！”","""Go back!""he said.""You can’t stay with me, and I don’t want anybody staying with me.If you’ve come after money, you’ve mistaken your man, I tell you, I’ve got nothing, see you! It’s two days since I even had a bit of bread."" "
"“可现在我没法回家去，”她说，“路上尽是兵。”","""I can’t go back home now,""she said.""The road is full of soldiers."" "
"“走开！这不干我的事！人人都必须当心保护他自己。”","""Clear out! What do I care! Everybody must be looking out for their own skin."" "
"当她像一条被人用脚踢开的狗那样转身打算离去时，格拉米格纳又叫住了她：“听着！到那边的小溪里去给我打一瓶水来。如果你真要和我待在一起，你不得不冒生命的危险。”","While she was turning away from him, like a dog driven off with kicks, Gramigna called to her.－""Listen! Go and fetch me a bottle of water from the stream down there.If you want to stay with me,you’ve got to risk your skin."" "
"佩帕一声不吭地走了。格拉米格纳听到枪声，便尖刻地大笑起来，一面自言自语道：“这些可都是为我准备的啊！”但是不一会儿，当他看见她脸色苍白，鲜血淋淋，腋下夹着一个瓶子跑回来时，他猛地扑上去，一把夺过瓶子，直到喝得喘不过气来后，才问她道：","Peppa went without a word, and when Gramigna heard the firing he began to laugh bitingly, saying to himself:""That was meant for me!""－But when he saw her coming back, a little later, with the flask under her arm, herself pale and bleeding, he first threw himself on her and snatched the bottle, and then when he had drunk till he was out of breath, he asked her: "
"“这么说，你躲开了他们？你是怎样逃脱的？”","""You got away then? How did you manage?"" "
"“士兵们都在那边，这边的仙人掌又很密。” ","""The soldiers were on the other side, and the cactuses were thick this side."" "
"“不过他们还是在你身上打了个窟窿？衣服底下在流血吗？” ","""They’ve made a hole in you, though. Is it bleeding under your clothes?"" "
"“是的。”","""Yes."" "
"“你哪儿受了伤？”","""Where are you wounded?"" "
"“肩上。”","""In the shoulder."""
"“这没关系，你能走。”","""That doesn’t matter. You can walk."" "
"就这样，他答应让她留下。她追随着他，衣服划破了，身子因为那个伤口而发着烧，还要光着双脚去给他弄一瓶水或是一片面包。每当她冒着枪林弹雨空手回来时，她的情人由于受不住饥渴的煎熬，就会揍她。后来，有一天晚上，月光照在仙人掌丛上，格拉米格纳对她说：“他们过来了。”他叫她在石缝的底部躺下，随后自己就逃到另一个地方。仙人掌丛中响起了经久不息的枪声，东一点西一点的火光一闪一闪地划破了漆黑的夜空。突然，佩帕听到身旁响起了一阵脚步声，抬眼一看，格拉米格纳拖着一条断腿走了回来，正靠在仙人掌宽阔的茎叶上往枪里装子弹。“全完了！”他对她说，“现在他们要抓住我了。”然而，最使她恐惧不安的是他那闪闪发光的眼睛，就像疯了一般。接着他像一捆木柴似的倒在干枯的树枝上，许多民兵一拥而上。","Thus he gave her permission to stay with him. She followed him, her clothes torn, her body burning with the fever of her wound, shoeless, and she went to get him a flask of water or a hunk of bread, and when she came back empty handed, in the thick of the firing, her lover, devoured by hunger and by thirst, beat her. At last, one night when the moon was shining on the cactus grove, Gramigna said to her: ""They are coming!"" and he made her lie down flat, at the bottom of the cleft in continual firing was heard, and the darkness flushed here and there with brief flames. All at once Peppa heard a noise of feet near her and she looked up to see Gramigna returning, dragging a broken leg, and leaning against the broad stems of the cactus to load his gun.""It’s  all up!""he said to her.""They’ll get me now""－and what froze her blood more than anything  was the glitter in his eyes that made him look like a madman. Then when he fell on the dry branches like a bundle of wood, the militiamen were on him in a heap. "
"第二天，他被放在一辆马车上，从村里的街上慢慢走过，浑身上下伤痕累累，血迹斑斑。止不住大笑起来。佩帕正是为了他才离开那个“蜡烛”的！可怜的“蜡烛”跑去躲了起来，好像这是他的耻辱。佩帕的金子虽然和圣玛格丽特一样多，却戴着手铐，被两个士兵押走了，像是另一个强盗那样。为了使自己的孩子获释，可怜的老母亲不得不卖掉嫁妆中“所有那些洁白的什物”，金耳环和十个手指上戴的戒指，去请律师，随后还得把她带回家去。佩帕这时候贫病交加，受了耻辱，简直和格拉米格纳一样丑陋，怀里还抱着格拉米格纳的孩子。等审讯结束，他们把女儿交还给那个可怜的老女人时，她在朦胧的暮色笼罩着的光秃秃兵营里，当着骑兵反复念诵着“圣母玛利亚”，仿佛得到的是一件无价之宝，因为女儿就是她的一切，可怜的老东西。宽慰的泪水如同泉水似的涌了出来。与此相反，佩帕的眼泪似乎已经枯竭，她什么话也没说，也从没见她在村里走动，尽管母女俩从此不得不靠辛勤的劳动来维持生活。人们说佩帕在灌木丛中学会了晚上出去偷东西的本领。事实上，她像一只野兽一样被悄悄地关起来待在厨房里，直到她的老母亲因为操劳过度而死去，不得不把房子卖掉。这时，她才重新露面。","Next day they dragged him through the streets of the village on a cart, all torn and blood stained. The people who pressed forward to see him began to laugh when they saw how little he was, pale and ugly like a figure in a Punch and Judy show. And it was for him that Peppa had left Neighbour Finu, the""Tallow candle""! Poor Tallowcandle,he went and hid himself as if the shame was his, and Peppa was led away between the soldiers, handcuffed, as if she were another robber, she who had as much gold as Saint Margaret herself. Peppa’s poor old mother had to sell ""all the white goods"" of the trousseau, and the golden earrings, and the rings for the ten fingers, to pay the lawyers to get off her child; then she had to take her back into the house, poor, sick, disgraced, and herself as ugly now as Gramigna, and with Gramigna’s child at her breast. But when they gave her back her daughter, at the end of the trial, the poor old woman repeated her Ave Maria, there in the darkening twilight of the naked barracks, among all the carabiniers, and it was as if they had given her a treasure, poor old thing, for this was all she had, and she wept like a fountain with relief. Peppa, on the contrary, seemed as if she had no more tears, and she said nothing, nor was she ever seen in the village, in spite of the fact that the two women had to go and earn their bread labouring. People said that Peppa had learned her trade out in the thickets, and that she went stealing at night. The truth was, she stayed lurking shut up in the kitchen like a wild beast, and she only came forth when her old woman was dead, worn out with hard work, and the house had to be sold. "
"“你瞧！”仍在爱着她的“蜡烛”说，“每当我想到你给自己和别人带来的不幸时，我真想一头撞死在石头上。”","""You see!""said Tallow’candle,who still cared for her.""I could knock my head against the stones when I think of all the misery you’ve brought on yourself and on everybody else."" "
"“是的，”佩帕回答说，“这我知道！这是上帝的旨意。”","""It’s true,""replied Peppa.""I know it! It was the will of God."" "
"她把房子和留下给她的几件家具卖掉，然后同上次回来时一样，在夜里离开了村庄，一次也没回头看看自己居住了那么多年的家。她遵循着上帝的旨意，带着她的男孩到城里去，在关押格拉米格纳的监狱附近住了下来。在高大死寂的监狱正面，除了窗子的铁栅，什么都看不见。倘若她目光炯炯地站在那儿寻觅着他的“家”时，看守总把她赶走。最后，他们告诉她，他已经不在那儿了。他们给他戴上手铐，脖子上套上篮子，从海上带走不少时候了。她什么也没说，也没有搬走，因为她不知道去哪儿是好，也没有人可以投奔。她似乎已经成了这幢阴暗寂静的高大建筑物的一部分，靠着给士兵和监狱的看守干一些零星活儿勉强糊口。后来，她又对那些在仙人掌丛中用子弹打断了格拉米格纳的腿、把他从她身边带走的骑兵产生了一种恭敬而体贴的心情，一种对蛮力的兽性的崇拜。每逢节日，当她看见骑兵们帽子前面插着那簇鲜红的羽毛，穿着镶有红条纹的深蓝军礼服，佩戴着耀眼的肩章，结实而挺直地站在那儿时，她总目不转睛地看着。她老是在兵营各处走动，打扫一间间公用的大房间，给他们擦皮靴，后来他们干脆叫她“骑兵们的擦鞋布”。只有在黄昏时分，当她看到他们佩带好武器，卷起裤腿，腰间插着手枪，一对对地出发，或者看到在路灯下，他们骑着马，步枪被照得闪闪发光，听着马刀的铿锵声和马蹄声渐渐远去，只有到这时，她才会脸色惨白，哆嗦着把马厩的门关上。她的孩子和一些小顽童一起在监狱前的平地上玩，在士兵们的胯下窜来窜去。当那些孩子跟在他后面，叫他“格拉米格纳的小崽子，格拉米格纳的小崽子”时，她就勃然大怒，用石头把他们赶走。","After she had sold the house and the few bits of furniture that remained to her, she left the village, in the night, as she had returned to it, without once turning back to look at the roof, under which she had slept for so many years; she went to fulfill the will of God in the city, along with her boy, settling near the prison where Gramigna was shut up.She could see nothing but the iron gratings of the windows, on the great mute fade, and the sentinels drove her off, if she stood to gaze searchingly for some sign of him. At last they told her he’d been gone from there for some time, that they with the basket round his neck. She didn’t say anything. She didn’t change her quarters, because she didn’t know where to go, and had nobody to go to. She eked out a living doing small jobs for the soldiers and the keepers of the prison, as if she too had been a part of that great, gloomy, silent building; and then she felt for the carabiniers who had taken Gramigna from her, in the cactus thicket, and who had broken his leg with a bullet, a sort of respectful tenderness, a sort of brute admiration of brute force. On feast days, when she saw them with their scarlet tuft of feathers sticking up in front of their hats, and with glittering epaulettes, all standing erect and square in their dress uniforms of dark devoured them with her eyes, and she was always about the barracks, sweeping out the big general rooms, and polishing boots, till they called her ""the carabinier’s shoe when she saw them fasten on their weapons after nightfall, and set off two by two, their trousers turned up, the revolver at their stomach; or when they mounted on horseback, under the street-lamp that made their rifles glitter ,and she heard the tread of horses lose itself in the distance, and the clink of sabres; then every time she turned pale, and as she shut the stable door she shuddered; and when her youngster was playing about with the other urchins on the level ground in front of the prison, running between the legs of the soldiers, and the other brats shouted after him: ""Gramigna’s kid! Gramigna’s kid!""she got in a rage, and ran after them, throwing stones at them."
"讨论","Discussion"
"这篇小说维尔加用致友人书简的形式写成。小说很短，可能是因为维尔加意识到，他的朋友能领会据他说是省略了的“中间部分”——事实上，他说，这样一种使人人都能发挥想象力的写作方法，最终有可能使“人人都感到很够了”——那就是，到了他们学会怎样去感受小说的内在动机和感情，不再依赖于作家的进一步解释和干预的时候。","This story is in the form of a letter to a friend of Verga. It is very short,presumably because Verga sensed that his friend would seize on the ""middie"" that he says is missing — and he says, in fact, that presumably such an act of participatory imagination will eventually be ""enough for everybody"" — that is, when they have learned to sense the inner motivations and feelings of fiction and not to depend on mere explanation or intrusion by the author."
"换句话说，维尔加试图让读者也卷进小说的创作中去。","In other words, Verga seeks to involve the reader’s own creative power in the story itself. "
"回到小说本身：这里我们只把这篇作品当做一个引言，因为至少在表面上，这是一篇强调情节，剧烈的具体情节的故事——在西西里晒得焦干的乡野，对大盗格拉米格纳进行大规模的追捕。就像“在村间，在农庄上，在小酒馆的树阴下，在俱乐部和大会堂里”所叙述的那样，这是一个逐日展开的故事，不过它却从格拉米格纳被放逐的故事转向了另一个“放逐”的故事。年轻、美丽的佩帕和全村的骄傲，既有钱又“像太阳那样漂亮”的菲努订了婚，忽然声称她不爱他，爱的是人们日夜追捕着的格拉米格纳，一个她素不相识的强盗。后来，消息传来说他被包围了，受了伤，断了水，她就逃奔到他那儿去，非但得不到他的感激，反而受到粗暴的对待。当格拉米格纳被抓住，拘禁起来，终于被关进监狱时，她自己也受了伤，怀着孩子，为人们所不齿。","To return to the story: we use it here as an introduction because it is,superficially at least, a story emphasizing action, violent physical action — the massive hunt across the parched countryside of Sicily for the outlaw Gramigna. This is the story that day by day unfolds as it is told""in the villages, in the farmsteads, under the bough-shelter of the inns, in the clubs and meeting-places."" But to Cramigna's tale of outlawry is grafted the tale of another kind of""outlawry.""The beautiful young Peppa, engaged to the pride of the village, Finu, who is both prosperous and""handsome as the sun,""announces that she is in love not with Finu but with the outlaw Gramigna, who is being hunted day and night, and whom she has never seen. Finally, when word comes that he has been surrounded and wounded and is cut off from water, she flees to him, to be received not gratefully but gruffly, and in the end to be wounded, left pregnant,and outcast, when Gramigna is taken and jailed,eventually to be sent off to a prison. Gramigna, who is being hunted day and night, and whom she has never seen. Finally, when word comes that he has been surrounded and wounded and is cut off from water, she flees to him, to be received not gratefully but gruffly, and in the end to be wounded, left pregnant, and outcast, when Gramigna is taken and jailed, eventually to be sent off to a prison."
"确实，小说中有不少情节，但这些情节掩盖着一个不可思议的东西，这就是作者没有讲述的故事的“中间部分”。是一种什么样的“非法行为”引着佩帕去寻找被追捕的格拉米格纳？为了一个素昧平生的强盗——而且据我们所知，他一点也不爱她，她竟然失去了体面、舒适、富裕和菲努对她的真诚的爱，这是一种什么性质的爱情呢？当调皮的孩子们嘲笑她的儿子，管他叫“格拉米格纳的小崽子”时，她就朝他们扔石头，是什么驱使她在孤独和贫困中以这种奇特的方式对她的强盗始终忠贞不渝呢？","There is action enough here, certainly, hut there is a mystery in the story beyond the action, the mystery that the author leaves in the untold ""middle"" of the story. What kind of ""outlawry"" draws Peppa to seek the hunted Gramigna? What is the nature of the ""love"" that makes her forfeit respectability, comfort, prosperity, Finu’s true adoration for her, all for an outlaw she has never seen—and who, as far as we ever know, cares nothing for her? What makes her remain, through isolation and poverty, faithful to the end, in her strange way, to her outlaw, as she throws stones at the brats who tease her son, shouting at him,""Gramigna’s kid""?"
"因此，这篇着重情节的小说终究也是一篇着重人物和心理描写的小说，还是一篇有主题的小说。它让我们去思索一个关于爱情性质的神秘问题，一个涉及到爱情与舒适和冒险之间的关系，涉及到献出爱情和接受爱情之间的关系的问题。","So the story of action is a story of character and psychology after all, and a story of theme, leaving us to ponder a mysterious question about the nature of love, a question involving the relation of love to ease and risk, to receiving and giving."
"不过，我们能否把小说中的情节、人物和主题这些部分截然区分出来呢？不，它们都是同一个重要事件的各个侧面，是一个整体的必不可少的组成部分。","But can we sort out these elements of action, character, and theme as distinct elements in the story? No,they are all aspects of the same massive event. They are part of a vital unity."
"思考题","Questions"
"1. 显然，大多数年轻姑娘不会像佩帕那样行事，她们会按照村里的习俗和菲努一起幸福地生活。佩帕期望从这与众不同的爱情中得到什么？你是如何评价她所期望的一切的？1. 我们怎样来理解佩帕和格拉米格纳的关系？怎样来理解他们的初遇？后来，她还生养下他的孩子，然而我们能否从某种意义上假定他“爱”她呢？1. 如果要你用较长的篇幅来写这篇小说，你将在省略掉的神秘的“中间部分”增加些什么内容呢？现在，你是如何理解佩帕最后采取的根本立场的？它是否是一种后悔、怨恨、屈从于命运、对价值看法改变的表现呢？姚梅琪 译）","1. Clearly, most young girls would not act as Peppa does. They would settle down happily with Finu and village conventionality. What does Peppa expect from love that is different? How do you assess the value of her expectations?1. What are we to make of the relation of Peppa and Gramigna? What are we to make of their first encounter? Later on, she is to have a child by him, yet in any sense can we assume that he""loves"" her?1. If you were to write the story on a larger scale, what would you put into the mysterious and missin ""middle"" ? What do you now make of Peppa’s basic attitude at the end? Is it one of regret, bitterness, acceptance of fate, a change of values?"
