"作者：H. G. 韦尔斯","by H. G. Wells"
"一年前，在七盘商业区附近还有一家看起来很脏的小店。店招牌上写着“C. 凯夫，博物学家和古董经销商”的字样。这些字历经风吹雨打，已经泛黄了。橱窗里陈列了一些稀奇古怪、五颜六色的东西。这里有一些象牙，一副不完整的象棋，一些念珠和武器，一盒眼珠，两只老虎头骨，一只人头骨，几只布满虫蛀痕迹的猴子标本（其中一只拿着一盏灯），一个旧式的柜子，一只好像是沾满蝇卵的鸵鸟蛋，一些钓鱼工具，以及一只脏兮兮的空玻璃鱼缸。在故事开始的时候，还有一大块水晶。这水晶被做成鸡蛋的形状，而且被磨得闪闪发光。有两个人站在橱窗外，正看着这只水晶蛋。其中一个又高又瘦，是个牧师，另一个是位长着黑胡子的年轻人。他肤色黝黑，穿着并不引人注意。这个肤色黝黑的年轻人一边说话一边急切地打着手势，似乎急着想让他的同伴买下这个东西。","There was, until a year ago, a little and very grimy-looking shop near Seven Dials, over which, in weather-worn yellow lettering, the name of “C. Cave, Naturalist and Dealer in Antiquities,” was inscribed.The contents of its window were curiously variegated.They comprised some elephant tusks and an imperfect set of chessmen, beads and weapons, a box of eyes, two skulls of tigers and one human, several moth-eaten stuffed monkeys (one holding a lamp), an old-fashioned cabinet, a fly-blown ostrich egg or so, some fishing-tackle, and an extraordinarily dirty, empty glass fish-tank.There was also, at the moment the story begins, a mass of crystal, worked into the shape of an egg and brilliantly polished.And at that two people who stood outside the window were looking, one of them a tall, thin clergyman, the other a black-bearded young man of dusky complexion and unobtrusive costume.The dusky young man spoke with eager gesticulation, and seemed anxious for his companion to purchase the article."
"当他们站在那儿的时候，凯夫先生走进他的店里，胡子上还晃动着吃茶点时沾上的面包屑和奶油。当他看见这两个人，发现他们正盯着那个水晶蛋时，他的脸色沉了下来。他面带愧色地朝身后看了一眼，然后轻轻地关上了门。他是个小个子老头，脸色苍白，一双蓝眼睛却格外水灵，头发呈暗灰色。他身穿一件破旧的蓝大衣，头戴一顶老旧的丝绸帽子，脚蹬一双脚后跟处被磨掉许多的软拖鞋。那两个人谈话的时候，他一直在看着他们。牧师把手伸进裤兜深处，摸到了一把钱，满意地咧嘴笑了起来。当他们走进店里时，凯夫先生似乎更加沮丧了。","While they were there, Mr. Cave came into his shop, his beard still wagging with the bread and butter of his tea.When he saw these men and the object of their regard, his countenance fell.He glanced guiltily over his shoulder, and softly shut the door.He was a little old man, with pale face and peculiar watery blue eyes; his hair was a dirty grey, and he wore a shabby blue frock-coat, an ancient silk hat, and carpet slippers very much down at heel.He remained watching the two men as they talked.The clergyman went deep into his trouser pocket, examined a handful of money, and showed his teeth in an agreeable smile.Mr. Cave seemed still more depressed when they came into the shop."
"牧师没说什么客套话，直接问起这只水晶蛋的价格来。凯夫先生紧张地朝通往客厅那边的门看了一眼，然后说卖五英镑。牧师向他的同伴以及凯夫先生表示反对，说这个价格太高了——确实，这个价格比凯夫先生当初进货时想要卖出的价格高出了许多——然后他们就开始讨价还价起来。凯夫先生走到店门口，把门打开了。“就卖五英镑了。”他说道。仿佛他想省去麻烦，不想继续这种没有意义的争论。那扇通往客厅的门上半部是玻璃镶板，玻璃上遮着窗帘。就在这时，一个女人的上半张脸出现在窗帘上方，好奇地盯着这两位顾客。“就卖五英镑。”凯夫先生说道。他的声音在发颤。","The clergyman, without any ceremony, asked the price of the crystal egg.Mr. Cave glanced nervously towards the door leading into the parlour, and said five pounds.The clergyman protested that the price was high, to his companion as well as to Mr. Cave—it was, indeed, very much more than Mr. Cave had intended to ask when he had stocked the article—and an attempt at bargaining ensued.Mr. Cave stepped to the shop door, and held it open.“Five pounds is my price,” he said, as though he wished to save himself the trouble of unprofitable discussion.As he did so, the upper portion of a woman’s face appeared above the blind in the glass upper panel of the door leading into the parlour, and stared curiously at the two customers.“Five pounds is my price,” said Mr. Cave, with a quiver in his voice."
"那个面色黝黑的年轻人一直保持着旁观者的姿态，两眼敏锐地盯着凯夫先生。这时他说话了。“给他五英镑。”他说。牧师瞥了他一眼，看看他是不是认真的。当他再次转向凯夫先生时，他发现凯夫先生脸色苍白。“那可是一大笔钱。”牧师说着把手伸进裤兜，开始数钱。他只有三十个先令，于是只能求助那个看上去跟他关系很亲密的同伴。这让凯夫先生有机会整理一下自己的思绪。然后他开始焦躁不安地解释说其实这块水晶并不完全是拿来卖的。他的两位顾客自然感到很奇怪，便问他为什么不在开始讨价还价前说清楚。凯夫先生变得颠三倒四起来，但是他坚持自己的说法，说这块水晶今天下午不卖，已经有人说要来买它了。这两位顾客认为他这样说只是想进一步抬高价格，便做出要离开商店的样子。但就在这时，通往客厅的那扇门打开了，那个留着深色刘海，张着一双小眼睛的女人出现了。","The swarthy young man had so far remained a spectator, watching Cave keenly.Now he spoke.“Give him five pounds,” he said.The clergyman glanced at him to see if he were in earnest, and when he looked at Mr. Cave again, he saw that the latter’s face was white.“It’s a lot of money,” said the clergyman, and, diving into his pocket, began counting his resources.He had little more than thirty shillings, and he appealed to his companion, with whom he seemed to be on terms of considerable intimacy.This gave Mr. Cave an opportunity of collecting his thoughts, and he began to explain in an agitated manner that the crystal was not, as a matter of fact, entirely free for sale.His two customers were naturally surprised at this, and inquired why he had not thought of that before he began to bargain.Mr. Cave became confused, but he stuck to his story, that the crystal was not in the market that afternoon, that a probable purchaser of it had already appeared.The two, treating this as an attempt to raise the price still further, made as if they would leave the shop.But at this point the parlour door opened, and the owner of the dark fringe and the little eyes appeared."
"这是个面色粗糙、体态肥胖的女人，比凯夫先生年轻，却比他魁梧得多。她费劲地走过来，脸涨得通红。“那块水晶可以卖。”她说，“五英镑对它来说是个不错的价钱。我不知道你在想什么，凯夫，竟然不接受这位绅士的出价！”","She was a coarse-featured, corpulent woman, younger and very much larger than Mr. Cave; she walked heavily, and her face was flushed.“That crystal is for sale,” she said.“And five pounds is a good enough price for it.I can’t think what you’re about, Cave, not to take the gentleman’s offer!”"
"她的突然闯入让凯夫先生感到极其心烦意乱。他从眼镜框上愤怒地看着她，坚称他有权用自己的方式来打理他的生意，虽然他说这话时并不是很有底气。随后一场争吵便开始了。这两位顾客饶有兴致地看着他们争吵，偶尔还给凯夫夫人出出主意。凯夫先生被逼急了，坚持说那天上午有人来问过这块水晶，他说得稀里糊涂，让人无法相信，而他焦躁的心情也让他痛苦不堪。但是他仍然极其固执地坚持着自己的说法。最后还是那位年轻的东方人结束了这场奇怪的争论。他提议说，他们应该两天之内再来拜访一次——从而给凯夫先生所说的那位顾客一个公平的机会。“到时候我们必须说定，”牧师说，“就五英镑了。”凯夫夫人亲自代她丈夫向他们道了歉，并解释说他有时候就是“有点怪”。这两位顾客离开之后，这对夫妇便开始毫无顾忌地讨论这件事的来龙去脉了。","Mr. Cave, greatly perturbed by the irruption, looked angrily at her over the rims of his spectacles, and, without excessive assurance, asserted his right to manage his business in his own way.An altercation began.The two customers watched the scene with interest and some amusement, occasionally assisting Mrs. Cave with suggestions.Mr. Cave, hard driven, persisted in a confused and impossible story of an inquiry for the crystal that morning, and his agitation became painful.But he stuck to his point with extraordinary persistence.It was the young Oriental who ended this curious controversy.He proposed that they should call again in the course of two days—so as to give the alleged inquirer a fair chance.“And then we must insist,” said the clergyman.“Five pounds.”Mrs. Cave took it on herself to apologise for her husband, explaining that he was sometimes “a little odd,” and as the two customers left, the couple prepared for a free discussion of the incident in all its bearings."
"凯夫夫人和她丈夫说话时单刀直入。这个可怜的小老头情绪激动、声音颤抖，一会儿说已经有人想买这块水晶了，一会儿又说这块水晶其实值十基尼，把自己都搞糊涂了。“那你为什么只要价五英镑呢？”他妻子问道。","Mrs. Cave talked to her husband with singular directness.The poor little man, quivering with emotion, muddled himself between his stories, maintaining on the one hand that he had another customer in view, and on the other asserting that the crystal was honestly worth ten guineas.“Why did you ask five pounds?” said his wife."
"“你就让我自己打理我的生意吧！”凯夫先生说。","“Do let me manage my business my own way!” said Mr. Cave."
"凯夫先生和一个继女、一个继子一起生活。那天晚上吃晚饭的时候他们又讨论起了这笔交易。他们没人赞同凯夫先生的经营之道，都认为凯夫先生这次的行为简直蠢到家了。","Mr. Cave had living with him a step-daughter and a step-son, and at supper that night the transaction was re-discussed.None of them had a high opinion of Mr. Cave’s business methods, and this action seemed a culminating folly."
"“在我看来，他以前肯定也拒绝出售这块水晶。”他的继子说道。这个继子年方十八，手脚灵活，行为却很粗鄙。","“It’s my opinion he’s refused that crystal before,” said the step-son, a loose-limbed lout of eighteen."
"“但那可是五英镑呢！”他的继女说道。她今年二十六岁，是个好争论的年轻女子。","“But Five Pounds!” said the step-daughter, an argumentative young woman of six-and-twenty."
"凯夫先生的所有辩解都是徒劳的。他只能嘟囔着，无力地硬说只有他才最清楚他自己的生意。晚饭才吃了一半，他们就赶他走，叫他去店里把店门关了。他耳根发热，愤怒的泪水在眼镜后面打转。为什么他要把那块水晶放在橱窗里这么长时间呢？真是愚蠢！他满脑子都是这件麻烦事。有那么一会儿，他觉得这笔买卖是逃不掉了。","Mr. Cave’s answers were wretched; he could only mumble weak assertions that he knew his own business best.They drove him from his half-eaten supper into the shop, to close it for the night, his ears aflame and tears of vexation behind his spectacles.Why had he left the crystal in the window so long?The folly of it!That was the trouble closest in his mind.For a time he could see no way of evading sale."
"晚饭过后，他的继子和继女打扮了一番之后就出去了，而他的妻子上楼休息去了。她一边想着那块水晶的买卖，一边喝着加糖的热柠檬汁。凯夫先生来到店里，一直在那里呆到很晚。他假装是在为金鱼缸做装饰用的假山，实际上是在干一件私密的事，详情以后再解释。第二天，凯夫夫人发现有人把那块水晶从橱窗里拿走，放在了几本斜放着的二手书后面。她把它重放到了一个显眼的位置。但是她没有为这事继续争吵，因为她头疼得厉害，不愿意再吵了。而凯夫先生从来都不愿意争吵。这一天就这么闷闷不乐地过去了。如果有什么不一样的话，那就是凯夫先生比平时更心不在焉了，他显得异常地焦躁。下午，当他妻子照常午睡时，他又把那块水晶从橱窗里拿走了。","After supper his step-daughter and step-son smartened themselves up and went out and his wife retired upstairs to reflect upon the business aspects of the crystal, over a little sugar and lemon and so forth in hot water.Mr. Cave went into the shop, and stayed there until late, ostensibly to make ornamental rockeries for gold-fish cases, but really for a private purpose that will be better explained later.The next day Mrs. Cave found that the crystal had been removed from the window, and was lying behind some second-hand books on angling.She replaced it in a conspicuous position.But she did not argue further about it, as a nervous headache disinclined her from debate.Mr. Cave was always disinclined.The day passed disagreeably.Mr. Cave was, if anything, more absent-minded than usual, and uncommonly irritable withal.In the afternoon, when his wife was taking her customary sleep, he removed the crystal from the window again."
"第二天，凯夫先生要给一所医学院交送用来解剖的狗鲨。他不在店里的时候，凯夫太太的脑子里又在想那块水晶的事，想着该如何恰当地花掉这五英镑的意外之财。她已经想到几种很不错的花销方式了，其中包括为自己买一件绿色丝绸上衣，去里士满旅游一趟。正在这时，前门的门铃响了，她闻声便回到了店里。顾客是一位助考教师，他来这儿是埋怨他们没有把前一天预订的几只青蛙送过去。凯夫太太并不赞成凯夫先生经营这项业务。这位绅士来的时候气势汹汹，和凯夫太太简短地说了几句话之后就走了。他的言谈十分礼貌——至少在他自己看来是这样的。然后，凯夫太太的目光自然地转向了橱窗，因为看到这块水晶就等于看到了五英镑和她的梦想。然而令她大吃一惊的是，水晶竟然不见了！","The next day Mr. Cave had to deliver a consignment of dog-fish at one of the hospital schools, where they were needed for dissection.In his absence, Mrs. Cave’s mind reverted to the topic of the crystal, and the methods of expenditure suitable to a windfall of five pounds.She had already devised some very agreeable expedients, among others a dress of green silk for herself and a trip to Richmond, when a jangling of the front door bell summoned her into the shop.The customer was an examination coach who came to complain of the non-delivery of certain frogs asked for the previous day.Mrs. Cave did not approve of this particular branch of Mr. Cave’s business, and the gentleman, who had called in a somewhat aggressive mood, retired after a brief exchange of words—entirely civil, so far as he was concerned.Mrs. Cave’s eye then naturally turned to the window; for the sight of the crystal was an assurance of the five pounds and of her dreams.What was her surprise to find it gone!"
"她来到柜台上的那个抽屉后面，前一天她就是在那儿找到它的。可是水晶并不在那儿。于是她立马开始焦急地在店里四处寻找。","She went to the place behind the locker on the counter, where she had discovered it the day before.It was not there; and she immediately began an eager search about the shop."
"凯夫先生送完狗鲨回来的时候大概是下午一点四十五分，他发现店里一片混乱，他妻子正极其愤怒地跪在柜台后面，在他的那些动物标本里找来找去。听见门铃响起，她知道他回来了，就满脸愤怒地从柜台后面站起来，劈头盖脸地指责他“把它藏起来了”。","When Mr. Cave returned from his business with the dogfish, about a quarter to two in the afternoon, he found the shop in some confusion, and his wife, extremely exasperated and on her knees behind the counter, routing among his taxidermic material.Her face came up hot and angry over the counter, as the jangling bell announced his return, and she forthwith accused him of “hiding it.”"
"“把什么藏起来了？”凯夫先生问。","“Hid what?” asked Mr. Cave. "
"“那块水晶！”","“The crystal!”"
"听到这句话，凯夫先生显然非常惊讶，急忙冲到橱窗前。“它不在这儿了吗？”他说，","At that Mr. Cave, apparently much surprised, rushed to the window.“Isn’t it here?” he said."
"“天哪！它到哪里去了？”","“Great Heavens! what has become of it?”"
"就在这时，凯夫先生的继子从里屋走回店里——他比凯夫先生早一两分钟回来——他在毫无顾忌地咒骂。他正在给街上的一个二手家具经销商当学徒，但是回家吃饭。他发现饭没做好，自然会生气。","Just then Mr. Cave’s step-son re-entered the shop from, the inner room—he had come home a minute or so before Mr. Cave—and he was blaspheming freely.He was apprenticed to a second-hand furniture dealer down the road, but he had his meals at home, and he was naturally annoyed to find no dinner ready."
"但是，一听说水晶不见了，他就忘了吃饭的事，把他的怒气从他母亲身上转到了他继父身上。当然，他们最先想到的就是他把水晶藏起来了。但是凯夫先生极力否认，说他根本不知道水晶的下落，并表示愿意坦率地公布自己知道的一点相关情况——最后他渐渐开始指责他的妻子，然后又指责他的继子，说他们把水晶藏了起来，想偷偷卖掉。于是双方开始了一场剑拔弩张的争论，结果凯夫太太情绪非常激动，一会儿歇斯底里，一会儿怒气冲天，还搞得继子下午去家具店上班迟到了半个小时。为了躲开情绪激动的妻子，凯夫先生躲到了店里。","But when he heard of the loss of the crystal, he forgot his meal, and his anger was diverted from his mother to his step-father.Their first idea, of course, was that he had hidden it.But Mr. Cave stoutly denied all knowledge of its fate, freely offering his bedabbled affidavit in the matter—and at last was worked up to the point of accusing, first, his wife and then his step-son of having taken it with a view to a private sale.So began an exceedingly acrimonious and emotional discussion, which ended for Mrs. Cave in a peculiar nervous condition midway between hysterics and amuck, and caused the step-son to be half-an-hour late at the furniture establishment in the afternoon.Mr. Cave took refuge from his wife’s emotions in the shop."
"晚上在继女的主持下，他们又提起了这件事情，这回大家情绪比较缓和，都想得到一个公平的说法。晚饭吃得很不愉快，最后又不欢而散。凯夫先生最后愤怒到了极点，猛地摔门而去。家里其他人趁他不在的时候毫无顾忌地指责他，并把房子上上下下都搜了个遍，希望能找到水晶。","In the evening the matter was resumed, with less passion and in a judicial spirit, under the presidency of the step-daughter.The supper passed unhappily and culminated in a painful scene.Mr. Cave gave way at last to extreme exasperation, and went out banging the front door violently.The rest of the family, having discussed him with the freedom his absence warranted, hunted the house from garret to cellar, hoping to light upon the crystal."
"第二天，那两位顾客又来了。凯夫太太接待他们的时候几欲落泪。她吐露说没有人能想象得出她和凯夫结婚以来，一次又一次地忍受了多少委屈……她还含糊不清地描述了水晶失踪的情况。牧师和那个东方人默默地相视一笑，说这事相当离奇。当他们意识到凯夫太太打算把她一生的经历都讲述给他们听的时候，他们便起身离开了这家店。至此凯夫太太仍不死心。她要求牧师留下他的地址，这样要是她能从凯夫那里套出任何消息，她就能联系他了。牧师应其要求留下了地址，但很显然她后来不知道把这地址丢到哪里去了。凯夫太太根本不记得有这么一回事了。","The next day the two customers called again.They were received by Mrs. Cave almost in tears.It transpired that no one could imagine all that she had stood from Cave at various times in her married pilgrimage…She also gave a garbled account of the disappearance.The clergyman and the Oriental laughed silently at one another, and said it was very extraordinary.As Mrs. Cave seemed disposed to give them the complete history of her life they made to leave the shop.Thereupon Mrs. Cave, still clinging to hope, asked for the clergyman’s address, so that, if she could get anything out of Cave, she might communicate it.The address was duly given, but apparently was afterwards mislaid.Mrs. Cave can remember nothing about it."
"那天晚上凯夫夫妇似乎都已经没有力气再吵了。凯夫先生下午出门在外，晚饭时他沮丧地独自进餐，这与前几天激烈争论的场面形成了鲜明的对比。有段时间凯夫家的气氛很紧张，但是无论是水晶还是顾客都没有再出现过。","In the evening of that day the Caves seem to have exhausted their emotions, and Mr. Cave, who had been out in the afternoon, supped in a gloomy isolation that contrasted pleasantly with the impassioned controversy of the previous days.For some time matters were very badly strained in the Cave household, but neither crystal nor customer reappeared."
"现在，我们无需隐藏这件事了，必须承认凯夫先生说谎了。他十分清楚水晶在什么地方。它在雅各比·韦斯先生的房间里，此人是西邦尔大街上圣凯瑟琳医院的助理试教讲师。它就在餐具柜上，一部分被一块黑色的天鹅绒布盖住了，旁边还放着一瓶美国产的威士忌。事实上，这个故事的具体细节正是由韦斯先生引出来的。凯夫先生把水晶藏在装狗鲨的袋子里带到医院，然后极力要求这位年轻的研究者为他保管这块水晶。韦斯先生起初还有些迟疑。他与凯夫的关系有些特别。他喜欢特立独行的人，曾不止一次地邀请这个老头去他房间抽烟喝酒，听他泛泛地讲述他那相当有趣的人生态度，听他详细地诉说对他妻子的态度。当凯夫先生不在家而无法接待他的时候，韦斯先生也曾碰到过凯夫太太几次。他知道凯夫先生常常遭到干涉。他认真地掂量过这件事，决定保管这块水晶。凯夫先生保证以后会向他详细解释对这块水晶情有独钟的原因，但是当时他确实说过，他曾在水晶里看到过幻影。当天晚上他就来拜访了韦斯先生。","Now, without mincing the matter, we must admit that Mr. Cave was a liar.He knew perfectly well where the crystal was.It was in the rooms of Mr. Jacoby Wace, Assistant Demonstrator at St. Catherine’s Hospital, Westbourne Street.It stood on the sideboard partially covered by a black velvet cloth, and beside a decanter of American whisky.It is from Mr. Wace, indeed, that the particulars upon which this narrative is based were derived.Cave had taken off the thing to the hospital hidden in the dog-fish sack, and there had pressed the young investigator to keep it for him.Mr. Wace was a little dubious at first.His relationship to Cave was peculiar.He had a taste for singular characters, and he had more than once invited the old man to smoke and drink in his rooms, and to unfold his rather amusing views of life in general and of his wife in particular.Mr. Wace had encountered Mrs. Cave, too, on occasions when Mr. Cave was not at home to attend to him.He knew the constant interference to which Cave was subjected, and having weighed the story judicially, he decided to give the crystal a refuge.Mr. Cave promised to explain the reasons for his remarkable affection for the crystal more fully on a later occasion, but he spoke distinctly of seeing visions therein.He called on Mr. Wace the same evening."
"他讲述了一个复杂的故事。他说这块水晶是在另外一个古玩商的财物被强制拍卖时和其他零碎物品一起买回来的。他并不知道它的真实价值，于是只标价十先令。这块水晶以这个价格在他手里呆了几个月，正当他想“自降身价”时，却发现了一件奇怪的事。","He told a complicated story.The crystal he said had come into his possession with other oddments at the forced sale of another curiosity dealer’s effects, and not knowing what its value might be, he had ticketed it at ten shillings.It had hung upon his hands at that price for some months, and he was thinking of “reducing the figure,” when he made a singular discovery."
"那个时候他的身体状况很差——我们必须牢记，他的身体状况一直都在恶化——由于他的妻子和继子、继女无视他，甚至有意虐待他，他心里非常难过。他的妻子爱慕虚荣、大手大脚、冷酷无情，还越来越喜欢偷偷喝上一杯；他的继女吝啬小气、难以相处；而他的继子一有机会就会表露出对他极其厌恶的感情。生意上的事也压得他喘不过气来，韦斯先生认为他会时不时地酗酒放纵下。他从小过着舒适的生活，受过良好的教育，而一连几个星期，他都受着忧郁与失眠的折磨。他害怕打扰家人。每当感到受不了的时候，他就会从妻子身边悄悄溜走，在屋子附近徘徊。那是八月末，一天凌晨三点左右，他偶然来到了店里。","At that time his health was very bad—and it must be borne in mind that, throughout all this experience, his physical condition was one of ebb—and he was in considerable distress by reason of the negligence, the positive ill-treatment even, he received from his wife and step-children.His wife was vain, extravagant, unfeeling, and had a growing taste for private drinking; his step-daughter was mean and over-reaching; and his step-son had conceived a violent dislike for him, and lost no chance of showing it.The requirements of his business pressed heavily upon him, and Mr. Wace does not think that he was altogether free from occasional intemperance.He had begun life in a comfortable position, he was a man of fair education, and he suffered, for weeks at a stretch, from melancholia and insomnia.Afraid to disturb his family, he would slip quietly from his wife’s side, when his thoughts became intolerable, and wander about the house.And about three o’clock one morning, late in August, chance directed him into the shop."
"这个脏兮兮的小店一片漆黑，但有一个地方除外，他发现那儿闪着奇特的光。走近一看，原来是那只水晶蛋。它被放在橱窗那边的一个柜台的角落里。一道细细的光透过窗户的缝隙射到水晶蛋上，似乎要充满整个蛋体内部。","The dirty little place was impenetrably black except in one spot, where he perceived an unusual glow of light.Approaching this, he discovered it to be the crystal egg, which was standing on the corner of the counter towards the window.A thin ray smote through a crack in the shutters, impinged upon the object, and seemed as it were to fill its entire interior."
"凯夫先生想到这种现象不符合他年轻时学过的光学原理。他知道水晶会使光线发生折射，在其内部形成一个焦点，但是这种漫射与他所知道的物理概念并不一致。他走到离水晶更近的地方，里里外外打量了它一番。这瞬间唤醒了他年轻时对科学的好奇心，正是这种好奇心使他决定选择了这样一个职业。他惊奇地发现这光线并不稳定，而是在蛋内的物质里扭动着。水晶蛋看起来像是中空的球体，里面有一些发光的蒸汽。他不断移动，从不同角度观察它，突然他发现自己站在了水晶蛋和光线之间，但是水晶蛋依然在闪闪发光。他大为震惊，就把水晶蛋移出那道光线，把它带到店里最暗的地方。它仍然发亮，光线一直持续了四五分钟才慢慢变暗、消失。他又把这块水晶放在微弱的日光下，它马上又变得光芒四射。","It occurred to Mr. Cave that this was not in accordance with the laws of optics as he had known them in his younger days.He could understand the rays being refracted by the crystal and coming to a focus in its interior, but this diffusion jarred with his physical conceptions.He approached the crystal nearly, peering into it and round it, with a transient revival of the scientific curiosity that in his youth had determined his choice of a calling.He was surprised to find the light not steady, but writhing within the substance of the egg, as though that object was a hollow sphere of some luminous vapour.In moving about to get different points of view, he suddenly found that he had come between it and the ray, and that the crystal none the less remained luminous.Greatly astonished, he lifted it out of the light ray and carried it to the darkest part of the shop.It remained bright for some four or five minutes, when it slowly faded and went out.He placed it in the thin streak of daylight, and its luminousness was almost immediately restored."
"至少目前为止，韦斯先生可以证实凯夫先生的这个奇特的故事。他自己也曾好几次把这块水晶拿到光线下（光线的直径必须小于一毫米）。在完全黑暗的情况下，比如被天鹅绒包起来的时候，这块水晶确实能发出微弱的磷光。但是，这种光似乎有点特别，并不是所有人都能看见，比如说哈宾格先生——与巴斯德研究所有关的科学读物的读者应该很熟悉他的名字——就根本看不到任何光。韦斯先生对这光的分辨能力要比凯夫先生弱得多。即使是对于凯夫先生来说，这种能力的变化幅度也很大：在他极度虚弱和疲倦的时候看到的幻象才清晰。","So far, at least, Mr. Wace was able to verify the remarkable story of Mr. Cave.He has himself repeatedly held this crystal in a ray of light (which had to be of a less diameter than one millimetre).And in a perfect darkness, such as could be produced by velvet wrapping, the crystal did undoubtedly appear very faintly phosphorescent.It would seem, however, that the luminousness was of some exceptional sort, and not equally visible to all eyes; for Mr. Harbinger—whose name will be familiar to the scientific reader in connection with the Pasteur Institute—was quite unable to see any light whatever.And Mr. Wace’s own capacity for its appreciation was out of comparison inferior to that of Mr. Cave’s.Even with Mr. Cave the power varied very considerably: his vision was most vivid during states of extreme weakness and fatigue."
"从一开始，凯夫先生就被水晶里的光深深地吸引住了。他没有向任何人说起他所观察到的这种奇怪现象。这比写上一本孤寂的书更能说明他心灵的孤寂。他似乎是长期受到小肚鸡肠、居心叵测的环境的熏陶，觉得一旦承认乐趣的存在就会有失去乐趣风险。他发现随着黎明的到来，漫射的光线逐渐增多，水晶完全暗淡了下来。有段时间，只有在夜里把它放在店里黑暗的角落里，他才能看见水晶里的东西。","Now, from the outset, this light in the crystal exercised a curious fascination upon Mr. Cave.And it says more for his loneliness of soul than a volume of pathetic writing could do, that he told no human being of his curious observations.He seems to have been living in such an atmosphere of petty spite that to admit the existence of a pleasure would have been to risk the loss of it.He found that as the dawn advanced, and the amount of diffused light increased, the crystal became to all appearance non-luminous.And for some time he was unable to see anything in it, except at night-time, in dark corners of the shop."
"但是，如果他把一块给矿石当背景的旧天鹅绒布对折，盖在头上和手上，即使在白天他也能看见水晶里面光线的运动情况了。他非常小心，以免被他妻子发现。他只在下午趁他妻子在楼上睡觉的时候才躲在柜子下的空洞里小心翼翼地观察水晶。有一天，他把水晶放在手上转动着，又发现了某样东西。这东西像闪电般一闪而过，但是一瞬间又让他产生这样的印象——他似乎看到一片宽广、开阔却又陌生的田野；他把水晶转来转去，当光线减弱时，他又一次看到了这种景象。","But the use of an old velvet cloth, which he used as a background for a collection of minerals, occurred to him, and by doubling this, and putting it over his head and hands, he was able to get a sight of the luminous movement within the crystal even in the day-time.He was very cautious lest he should be thus discovered by his wife, and he practised this occupation only in the afternoons, while she was asleep upstairs, and then circumspectly in a hollow under the counter.And one day, turning the crystal about in his hands, he saw something.It came and went like a flash, but it gave him the impression that the object had for a moment opened to him the view of a wide and spacious and strange country; and turning it about, he did, just as the light faded, see the same vision again."
"要把凯夫先生发现这一现象的过程一一道来要花很长时间，也没有必要。只需说明一下结果就行了：当视线与光线的夹角为137度左右时，水晶就会呈现出一幅广阔、奇特的田园风光，而且画面清晰、持久。这一点也不像梦：它给人完全实在的印象，光线越好，看起来就越真实。它如同一段电影：也就是说，里面有些物体像真实的东西一样在缓慢而有序地运动着，而且随着光线方向和视线方向的改变，画面也发生着变化。这就像透过一块椭圆形的玻璃观看一样，转动这块玻璃就可以看到不同的景象。","Now it would be tedious and unnecessary to state all the phases of Mr. Cave’s discovery from this point.Suffice that the effect was this: the crystal, being peered into at an angle of about 137 degrees from the direction of the illuminating ray, gave a clear and consistent picture of a wide and peculiar country-side.It was not dream-like at all: it produced a definite impression of reality, and the better the light the more real and solid it seemed.It was a moving picture: that is to say, certain objects moved in it, but slowly in an orderly manner like real things, and, according as the direction of the lighting and vision changed, the picture changed also.It must, indeed, have been like looking through an oval glass at a view, and turning the glass about to get at different aspects."
"韦斯先生向我保证说，凯夫先生的说法极其详细，而且完全不带任何破坏幻觉效果的感情因素。但是必须记住的是，韦斯先生也曾想方设法要从水晶的乳白色微光中看到差不多清晰的景象，但无论他怎么试都没有成功过。这两个人领会到的印象深浅不一，有很大的差别。因此完全可以理解，凯夫先生看到的景象对韦斯先生来说不过是一团模糊的东西罢了。","Mr. Cave’s statements, Mr. Wace assures me, were extremely circumstantial, and entirely free from any of that emotional quality that taints hallucinatory impressions.But it must be remembered that all the efforts of Mr. Wace to see any similar clarity in the faint opalescence of the crystal were wholly unsuccessful, try as he would.The difference in intensity of the impressions received by the two men was very great, and it is quite conceivable that what was a view to Mr. Cave was a mere blurred nebulosity to Mr. Wace."
"如凯夫先生所描述的那样，这幅景象总是像一片广阔的平原，而他似乎总是从一个相当高的地方对它进行观察，仿佛是从塔顶或杆子顶端往下看一样。在平原的东西两端，遥遥矗立着广袤的红色悬崖，这些悬崖使他想起了在某幅画里曾看到过的悬崖，但画上具体画着什么，韦斯先生就无法确定了。这两排悬崖纵贯南北——他可以根据夜晚的星星判断方位——绵延不绝，在交会前便双双消失在雾中。他更靠近东边的那座悬崖。他第一次看到这幅景象的时候，太阳正从悬崖上升起，有一大群东西在高空翱翔，在阳光的照耀下显得发黑，在悬崖的阴影下显得发白。凯夫先生认为这是一群鸟。在他下方有一大片房子；他似乎是在俯瞰这些房子；这些房子接近这幅图模糊不清的边缘时就变得不清晰了。在一条宽阔闪亮的运河旁边，还有一些奇形怪状的树木，这些树木呈苔藓般的深绿色和赏心悦目的灰色。一些体型庞大、色彩艳丽的家伙从这画面上飞过。但是凯夫先生第一次看到这些景象的时候，它们只是一闪而过。他颤抖着手，晃动着头，这景象就来来回回，渐渐变得模糊不清了。开始的时候，一旦他找不到景象消失的方向，他就很难再次看到它。","The view, as Mr. Cave described it, was invariably of an extensive plain, and he seemed always to be looking at it from a considerable height, as if from a tower or a mast.To the east and to the west the plain was bounded at a remote distance by vast reddish cliffs, which reminded him of those he had seen in some picture; but what the picture was Mr. Wace was unable to ascertain.These cliffs passed north and south—he could tell the points of the compass by the stars that were visible of a night—receding in an almost illimitable perspective and fading into the mists of the distance before they met.He was nearer the eastern set of cliffs; on the occasion of his first vision the sun was rising over them, and black against the sunlight and pale against their shadow appeared a multitude of soaring forms that Mr. Cave regarded as birds.A vast range of buildings spread below him; he seemed to be looking down upon them; and as they approached the blurred and refracted edge of the picture they became indistinct.There were also trees curious in shape, and in colouring a deep mossy green and an exquisite grey, beside a wide and shining canal.And something great and brilliantly coloured flew across the picture.But the first time Mr. Cave saw these pictures he saw only in flashes, his hands shook, his head moved, the vision came and went, and grew foggy and indistinct.And at first he had the greatest difficulty in finding the picture again once the direction of it was lost."
"大约一个星期以后，他第二次清晰地看到这幅景象。在这期间没有发生任何事情，他只是看到了几眼美景，得到了一些有用的经验。这回他看到了峡谷底下的景象。这次的景象有所不同，但是他有一种奇怪的感觉，那就是尽管他从不同的方向看这个世界，可总觉得是在同一个地方进行观察。这在他后来的观察中得到了充分的验证。这幢高大的建筑物（他曾俯视过它的屋顶）正从画面中渐渐远去。他认得那个屋顶。在这幢建筑物的前方有一个宽大的平台，平台中间每隔一定的距离就有粗壮却不失优雅的杆子，上面挂了一些闪闪发光的小东西，反射着夕阳的光芒。凯夫先生一直不明白这些小东西有什么作用，直到后来他向韦斯先生描述这幅景象的时候他才明白了过来。平台位于一片丛林之上，丛林里满是茂密漂亮的植被，更远处是宽阔的草坪，草坪上有一些巨大的动物在休息。这些动物长得像甲虫，但体型却比甲虫大得多。草坪旁边是一条用粉红色的石头精心装饰的小道，更远处有一片宽广如镜的水域，周围布满浓密的红色野草。这水流经峡谷，正好与远处的悬崖平行。空中似乎有一队队大鸟在沿着曲线庄严地飞着；河对岸有一片长满苔藓和地衣的树林，其间坐落着许多华美的建筑。房子富丽堂皇，金属窗饰和切面在闪闪发光。突然有个不断扑闪的东西从这景象中穿过，像是一把摇动的宝石扇或是一只拍动的翅膀，还出现了一张脸，更准确的说是长着一双大眼睛的上半张脸。这张脸出现时离他的脸很近，仿佛就在水晶的另一端。这双眼睛如此真实，让凯夫先生惊讶不已，也给他留下了深刻的印象。他转头去看水晶的后面。他观察得太入迷了，所以当他发现自己独自呆在又冷又黑的小店里时，着实吃了一惊。店里有他熟悉的木精和霉烂的味道。就在他眨眼的时候，水晶发出的光渐渐暗淡、消失了。","His next clear vision, which came about a week after the first, the interval having yielded nothing but tantalising glimpses and some useful experience, showed him the view down the length of the valley.The view was different, but he had a curious persuasion, which his subsequent observations abundantly confirmed, that he was regarding the strange world from exactly the same spot, although he was looking in a different direction.The long face of the great building, whose roof he had looked down upon before, was now receding in perspective.He recognised the roof.In the front of the face was a terrace of massive proportions and extraordinary length, and down the middle of the terrace, at certain intervals, stood huge but very graceful masts, bearing small shiny objects which reflected the setting sun.The import of these small objects did not occur to Mr. Cave until some time after, as he was describing the scene to Mr. Wace.The terrace overhung a thicket of the most luxuriant and graceful vegetation, and beyond this was a wide grassy lawn on which certain broad creatures, in form like beetles but enormously larger, reposed.Beyond this again was a richly decorated causeway of pinkish stone; and beyond that, and lined with dense red weeds, and passing up the valley exactly parallel with the distant cliffs, was a broad and mirror-like expanse of water.The air seemed full of squadrons of great birds, manoeuvring in stately curves; and across the river was a multitude of splendid buildings, richly coloured and glittering with metallic tracery and facets, among a forest of moss-like and lichenous trees.And suddenly something flapped repeatedly across the vision, like the fluttering of a jewelled fan or the beating of a wing, and a face, or rather the upper part of a face with very large eyes, came as it were close to his own and as if on the other side of the crystal.Mr. Cave was so startled and so impressed by the absolute reality of these eyes that he drew his head back from the crystal to look behind it.He had become so absorbed in watching that he was quite surprised to find himself in the cool darkness of his little shop, with its familiar odour of methyl, mustiness, and decay.And as he blinked about him, the glowing crystal faded and went out."
"这就是凯夫先生第一次看到这些景象时的大概印象。这故事异乎寻常的坦白而详尽。从一开始，当峡谷第一次闪现在他脑海中时，他的想象力就莫名其妙地被影响了。当他开始欣赏他所看到的景象的细节时，他的惊奇上升成了激情。他做起生意来无精打采、心烦意乱，一心只想着什么时候能回去观察那块水晶。在他第一次看到峡谷几个星期之后，那两位顾客就来了。他们的出价很高，让既他高兴又有压力。他差一点就把水晶卖出去了，这些我已经在前面讲过了。","Such were the first general impressions of Mr. Cave.The story is curiously direct and circumstantial.From the outset, when the valley first flashed momentarily on his senses, his imagination was strangely affected, and as he began to appreciate the details of the scene he saw, his wonder rose to the point of a passion.He went about his business listless and distraught, thinking only of the time when he should be able to return to his watching.And then a few weeks after his first sight of the valley came the two customers, the stress and excitement of their offer, and the narrow escape of the crystal from sale, as I have already told."
"这件事虽然是凯夫先生的秘密，但它仍然只是让人感到奇妙而已。凯夫先生只是偷偷地靠近看一看，就像一个孩子会偷看一座严禁入内的花园一样。但是，作为一名年轻的科学研究者，韦斯先生的思维特别清晰、极有逻辑。当他拿到了水晶，得知了它的故事之后，他就亲眼看到了这种磷光。这让他很满足，也证实了凯夫先生的话确实没错。他开始系统地研究这件事。凯夫先生急切地想回来欣赏他发现的奇妙之处。他每天晚上八点半来，十点半才走。有时白天韦斯先生不在的时候他也来。星期天下午他也过来。从一开始，韦斯先生就记了大量的笔记。正是他的科学方法证明了激发光线进入水晶的方向与所见画面的方向之间的关系。他把水晶放到一个只留有一个小孔的盒子里，这样激发光线就能从小孔中进入。另外他还用黑色的亚麻布换掉了他的浅黄色窗帘，大大改善了观察条件。因此一会儿过后，他们就能从他们喜欢的任何方向来观察峡谷了。","Now, while the thing was Mr. Cave’s secret, it remained a mere wonder, a thing to creep to covertly and peep at, as a child might peep upon a forbidden garden.But Mr. Wace has, for a young scientific investigator, a particularly lucid and consecutive habit of mind.Directly the crystal and its story came to him, and he had satisfied himself, by seeing the phosphorescence with his own eyes, that there really was a certain evidence for Mr. Cave’s statements, he proceeded to develop the matter systematically.Mr. Cave was only too eager to come and feast his eyes on this wonderland he saw, and he came every night from half-past eight until half-past ten, and sometimes, in Mr. Wace’s absence, during the day.On Sunday afternoons, also, he came.From the outset Mr. Wace made copious notes, and it was due to his scientific method that the relation between the direction from which the initiating ray entered the crystal and the orientation of the picture were proved.And, by covering the crystal in a box perforated only with a small aperture to admit the exciting ray, and by substituting black holland for his buff blinds, he greatly improved the conditions of the observations; so that in a little while they were able to survey the valley in any direction they desired."
"作了这么多铺垫之后，我们可以简单介绍这块水晶里的虚幻世界了。每一次凯夫先生负责观察。他的工作方法只是观察水晶并报告他所看到的东西。而韦斯先生（作为一名理科学生，他早就学会了在黑暗中记笔记的技巧）则基于他的报告简要地作一些记录。当水晶的光线变暗时，他们就把它放进盒子里的适当位置，然后打开灯。韦斯先生提出问题并提出建议进行观察来解决难点。的确，再也没有什么东西能如此虚幻而又如此真实了。","So having cleared the way, we may give a brief account of this visionary world within the crystal.The things were in all cases seen by Mr. Cave, and the method of working was invariably for him to watch the crystal and report what he saw, while Mr. Wace (who as a science student had learnt the trick of writing in the dark) wrote a brief note of his report.When the crystal faded, it was put into its box in the proper position and the electric light turned on.Mr. Wace asked questions, and suggested observations to clear up difficult points.Nothing, indeed, could have been less visionary and more matter-of-fact."
"凯夫先生的注意力很快就转向了那些看起来像鸟的动物。他在之前的观察中总是见到它们。他很快就纠正了第一次的印象。他思考了一会儿，认为它们可能是一种白天活动的蝙蝠类动物。可奇怪的是，他又认为它们也可能是小天使。它们的头部是圆的，像极了人的头部。他第二次观察的时候看到了其中一只的眼睛，那可把他吓坏了。它们长着宽大的银白色翅膀，没有羽毛，和刚刚被杀的鱼一样，颜色淡淡的，也发着光。韦斯先生发现，这些翅膀并没有长在鸟或蝙蝠的翅膀所在的部位，而是由体内长出的弯曲肋骨支撑着。（它们的样子用某种长着弯曲肋骨的蝴蝶翅膀来形容最为贴切。）这种动物体型很小，但是就在它们嘴巴下面长着两条能抓东西的器官，像是长长的触角。尽管韦斯先生觉得这不可思议，但是后来他不得不相信，正是这些动物拥有着那些让宽阔的峡谷如此蔚为壮观的大房子和漂亮的花园。这些大房子看起来很像人类的居所。凯夫先生发现这些房子和其他建筑都没有门，但是到处开着宽大的环形窗户。那些动物可以从这些窗户进进出出。它们会先用触角着地，把翅膀折叠成树枝那么细，然后跳进房子里。但是在这些动物中间还有一些翅膀稍小的动物，像是大蜻蜓、飞蛾和会飞的甲虫。颜色鲜艳的巨型甲虫懒洋洋地在绿油油的草地上爬来爬去。此外，在小道和平台上还可以看见一些头很大的动物，看起来和那些翅膀稍大的动物很像，却没有翅膀。它们在用手一样的触角不停蹦跳着。","The attention of Mr. Cave had been speedily directed to the bird-like creatures he had seen so abundantly present in each of his earlier visions.His first impression was soon corrected, and he considered for a time that they might represent a diurnal species of bat.Then he thought, grotesquely enough, that they might be cherubs.Their heads were round and curiously human, and it was the eyes of one of them that had so startled him on his second observation.They had broad, silvery wings, not feathered, but glistening almost as brilliantly as new-killed fish and with the same subtle play of colour, and these wings were not built on the plan of bird-wing or bat, Mr. Wace learned, but supported by curved ribs radiating from the body.(A sort of butterfly wing with curved ribs seems best to express their appearance.) The body was small, but fitted with two bunches of prehensile organs, like long tentacles, immediately under the mouth.Incredible as it appeared to Mr. Wace, the persuasion at last became irresistible that it was these creatures which owned the great quasi-human buildings and the magnificent garden that made the broad valley so splendid.And Mr. Cave perceived that the buildings, with other peculiarities, had no doors, but that the great circular windows, which opened freely, gave the creatures egress and entrance.They would alight upon their tentacles, fold their wings to a smallness almost rod-like, and hop into the interior.But among them was a multitude of smaller-winged creatures, like great dragon-flies and moths and flying beetles, and across the greensward brilliantly-coloured gigantic ground-beetles crawled lazily to and fro.Moreover, on the causeways and terraces, large-headed creatures similar to the greater winged flies, but wingless, were visible, hopping busily upon their hand-like tangle of tentacles."
"前面已经提到过，近处那些房子的平台上立着许多杆子，上面挂着一些闪闪发光的东西。在一个特别晴朗的日子里，凯夫先生非常仔细地看了下其中的一根杆子，突然发现杆子上闪闪发光的东西同他所观察的水晶一模一样。然后他更仔细地看了一遍。这使他确定了景象中大约二十根杆子上挂着的都是同样的东西。","Allusion has already been made to the glittering objects upon masts that stood upon the terrace of the nearer building.It dawned upon Mr. Cave, after regarding one of these masts very fixedly on one particularly vivid day that the glittering object there was a crystal exactly like that into which he peered.And a still more careful scrutiny convinced him that each one in a vista of nearly twenty carried a similar object."
"有一种大型的飞行动物偶尔会落到杆子上，折叠起翅膀，把一些触角缠绕在杆子上，然后盯着水晶看上一会儿——有时会看十五分钟之久。在韦斯先生的建议下，他们又做了一系列的观察。这让两个观察者都确信，就这个虚幻的世界而言，他们盯着往里看的这块水晶正是平台尽头处那根杆子顶端的那块。而且至少有一次，当凯夫先生正在观察的时候，这个异界的某个居民也朝他脸上看了看。","Occasionally one of the large flying creatures would flutter up to one, and folding its wings and coiling a number of its tentacles about the mast, would regard the crystal fixedly for a space,—sometimes for as long as fifteen minutes.And a series of observations, made at the suggestion of Mr. Wace, convinced both watchers that, so far as this visionary world was concerned, the crystal into which they peered actually stood at the summit of the end-most mast on the terrace, and that on one occasion at least one of these inhabitants of this other world had looked into Mr. Cave’s face while he was making these observations."
"这个奇怪故事的基本细节就介绍这么多了。除非我们认为这一切只是韦斯先生巧妙地捏造出来的，否则我们就必须相信以下两件事中的一个：要么凯夫先生的水晶同时存在于两个世界里。当它在一个世界里被拿来拿去的时候，它在另一个世界里保持不动。这看起来有些荒谬；要么它同另一个世界里的另一块完全一样的水晶有着某种奇特的同感关系。因此，在适当的条件下，另一个世界的观察者在对应的水晶里能观察到这个世界里这块水晶内部所呈现的东西。反之亦然。其实，目前我们还不知道有什么方法可以使这两块水晶步调一致，但是现在我们现在的知识足以告诉我们这是有可能实现的。这两块水晶能步调一致的设想是韦斯先生提出来的。至少对于我来说，这是非常可信的。","So much for the essential facts of this very singular story.Unless we dismiss it all as the ingenious fabrication of Mr. Wace, we have to believe one of two things: either that Mr. Cave’s crystal was in two worlds at once, and that while it was carried about in one, it remained stationary in the other, which seems altogether absurd; or else that it had some peculiar relation of sympathy with another and exactly similar crystal in this other world, so that what was seen in the interior of the one in this world was, under suitable conditions, visible to an observer in the corresponding crystal in the other world; and vice versa.At present, indeed, we do not know of any way in which two crystals could so come en rapport, but nowadays we know enough to understand that the thing is not altogether impossible.This view of the crystals as en rapport was the supposition that occurred to Mr. Wace, and to me at least it seems extremely plausible..."
"那么另外一个世界是哪里呢？在这个问题上，韦斯先生敏捷的思维也很快发挥了作用。太阳落山后，天色迅速变暗——间或会有些微光——那是闪耀的星光。这些星星同我们看到的那些星星一样，排列成相同的星座。凯夫先生认得小熊星，昴宿星，毕宿五星以及天狼星。因此另外一个世界一定在太阳系的某个地方，距离我们最多也只有几亿英里远。根据这条线索，韦斯先生发现午夜的天空甚至比我们冬至的天空更为深蓝，太阳看起来也更小一点。而且还有两个小月亮！“看起来像我们的月亮，但是更小，斑点也不一样。”其中的一个月亮运动得飞快，能被人清晰地观察到。这两个月亮在天空中的位置不高，但是它们上升的时候就消失了：每当它们沿轨道运转到一定地方，它们的光就被遮掩了，因为它们离主行星太近了。尽管凯夫先生并不知道，但是所有这些答案完全符合火星上的条件。","And where was this other world?On this, also, the alert intelligence of Mr. Wace speedily threw light.After sunset, the sky darkened rapidly—there was a very brief twilight interval indeed—and the stars shone out.They were recognisably the same as those we see, arranged in the same constellations.Mr. Cave recognised the Bear, the Pleiades, Aldebaran, and Sirius; so that the other world must be somewhere in the solar system, and, at the utmost, only a few hundreds of millions of miles from our own.Following up this clue, Mr. Wace learned that the midnight sky was a darker blue even than our midwinter sky, and that the sun seemed a little smaller.And there were two small moons!“like our moon but smaller, and quite differently marked,” one of which moved so rapidly that its motion was clearly visible as one regarded it.These moons were never high in the sky, but vanished as they rose: that is, every time they revolved they were eclipsed because they were so near their primary planet.And all this answers quite completely, although Mr. Cave did not know it, to what must be the condition of things on Mars."
"当凯夫先生朝水晶里看时，他实际上看到的是火星和火星上的居民。的确，这个结论看起来是相当可信的。如果确实如此的话，那么在那个遥远的夜景中闪烁的星星正是我们熟悉的地球。","Indeed, it seems an exceedingly plausible conclusion that peering into this crystal, Mr. Cave did actually see the planet Mars and its inhabitants.And if that be the case, then the evening star that shone so brilliantly in the sky of that distant vision was neither more nor less than our own familiar earth."
"有一段时间，火星人——如果他们是火星人的话——似乎还没有发觉凯夫先生在观察他们。有一两次火星人也过来看看，但很快又走开去其他的杆子上了，似乎他对看到的景象并不满意。趁他们不注意的时候，凯夫先生观察了一会儿这些长着翅膀的火星人，尽管他的报告相当含糊，也不够连贯，却还是很容易让人产生联想。想象下一个火星观察员会有什么样的印象。他经过艰辛的准备之后，不顾眼睛的极度疲劳，从圣马丁教堂的塔顶上盯着伦敦看，每次最多会观察四分钟。凯夫先生无法确定那些长着翅膀的火星人是否就是在小道和平台上蹦蹦跳跳的那些火星人，而且他也不清楚后者是否能随意插上翅膀。有几次他还看到一些笨手笨脚，有点像猿人的两足动物。它们身体是白色的，部分呈半透明状，在一些长满地衣的树丛中寻找食物。有一次有些两足动物被一个蹦蹦跳跳的圆头火星人追得四下逃窜。这个火星人用触角抓住了一只这种动物，就在这个时侯，画面突然变暗了，留下凯夫先生在黑暗中干着急。还有一次，出现了一个庞然大物（凯夫先生起初认为是某种巨型昆虫）。它正沿着运河旁的小道飞快地跑着。直到它靠近了一些，凯夫先生才发现这原来是一种由锃亮的金属制成的极其复杂的机械。等他再看时，这东西已经不见了。","For a time the Martians—if they were Martians—do not seem to have known of Mr. Cave’s inspection.Once or twice one would come to peer, and go away very shortly to some other mast, as though the vision was unsatisfactory.During this time Mr. Cave was able to watch the proceedings of these winged people without being disturbed by their attentions, and although his report is necessarily vague and fragmentary, it is nevertheless very suggestive.Imagine the impression of humanity a Martian observer would get who, after a difficult process of preparation and with considerable fatigue to the eyes, was able to peer at London from the steeple of St. Martin’s Church for stretches, at longest, of four minutes at a time.Mr. Cave was unable to ascertain if the winged Martians were the same as the Martians who hopped about the causeways and terraces, and if the latter could put on wings at will.He several times saw certain clumsy bipeds, dimly suggestive of apes, white and partially translucent, feeding among certain of the lichenous trees, and once some of these fled before one of the hopping, round-headed Martians.The latter caught one in its tentacles, and then the picture faded suddenly and left Mr. Cave most tantalisingly in the dark.On another occasion a vast thing, that Mr. Cave thought at first was some gigantic insect, appeared advancing along the causeway beside the canal with extraordinary rapidity.As this drew nearer Mr. Cave perceived that it was a mechanism of shining metals and of extraordinary complexity.And then, when he looked again, it had passed out of sight."
"一段时间以后，韦斯先生渴望引起火星人的注意。当其中一个火星人又一次把它奇怪的眼睛贴近水晶的时候，凯夫先生大叫一声跑开了，然后他们立即打开灯，开始做手势，仿佛在发出什么信号似的。但是等到后来凯夫先生再次观察水晶时，这个火星人已经离开了。","After a time Mr. Wace aspired to attract the attention of the Martians, and the next time that the strange eyes of one of them appeared close to the crystal, Mr. Cave cried out and sprang away, and they immediately turned on the light and began to gesticulate in a manner suggestive of signalling.But when at last Mr. Cave examined the crystal again the Martian had departed."
"到十一月初，他们的观察就进展到这个地步。凯夫先生觉得他的家人对水晶丢失的怀疑已经平息了，就开始把水晶带在身上进进出出，以便在白天或晚上偶尔拿出来看看，好安慰自己。这块水晶已经迅速成为了他生活中最真实的东西。","Thus far these observations had progressed in early November, and then Mr. Cave, feeling that the suspicions of his family about the crystal were allayed, began to take it to and fro with him in order that, as occasion arose in the daytime or night, he might comfort himself with what was fast becoming the most real thing in his existence."
"到了十二月，由于考试即将到来，韦斯先生忙着做相关的工作，不得不把他和凯夫先生的会谈暂停了一个星期。大概有十天或十一天——他也不是很确定——他都没有看到凯夫先生。之后他便急着要恢复那些研究。在摆脱了上个周期的工作压力后，他去了七盘商业区一趟。在拐角的地方，他发现一个养鸟人的窗前挂了一块遮板，而在一个皮匠的窗前他又看见了一块。凯夫先生的店已经关门了。","In December Mr. Wace’s work in connection with a forthcoming examination became heavy, the sittings were reluctantly suspended for a week, and for ten or eleven days—he is not quite sure which—he saw nothing of Cave.He then grew anxious to resume these investigations, and, the stress of his seasonal labours being abated, he went down to Seven Dials.At the corner he noticed a shutter before a bird fancier’s window, and then another at a cobbler’s.Mr. Cave’s shop was closed."
"他敲了敲门，凯夫先生的继子穿着一身黑色的衣服，打开了门。他马上叫来了凯夫太太。韦斯先生只看到凯夫太太穿着一身廉价而宽大的寡妇丧服，上面的图案非常显眼。当他知道凯夫先生去世并已下葬时，并没有感到特别惊讶。凯夫太太泪流满面，声音也有些沙哑。她刚从海格特墓地回来。她脑子里想的只是她自己的未来，想着葬礼那隆重的环节。韦斯先生最后总算知道了凯夫先生去世的详情。他一大早就被人发现死在了店里，也就是他最后一次拜访韦斯先生的第二天。他的手像石头一般冰冷，还握着那块水晶。凯夫太太说他是带着笑容死去的，那块用来衬托矿石的天鹅绒布落在他脚边的地板上。他一定是在死后五六个小时才被人发现的。","He rapped and the door was opened by the step-son in black.He at once called Mrs. Cave, who was, Mr. Wace could not but observe, in cheap but ample widow’s weeds of the most imposing pattern.Without any very great surprise Mr. Wace learnt that Cave was dead and already buried.She was in tears, and her voice was a little thick.She had just returned from Highgate.Her mind seemed occupied with her own prospects and the honourable details of the obsequies, but Mr. Wace was at last able to learn the particulars of Cave’s death.He had been found dead in his shop in the early morning, the day after his last visit to Mr. Wace, and the crystal had been clasped in his stone-cold hands.His face was smiling, said Mrs. Cave, and the velvet cloth from the minerals lay on the floor at his feet.He must have been dead five or six hours when he was found."
"这让韦斯先生感到非常震惊。他开始深深地责怪自己之前忽视了这位老人身体状况不佳所表现出来的一些明显的症状。但是他想的主要还是那块水晶。他小心翼翼地提起了那个话题，因为他了解凯夫太太的脾气。当他得知这块水晶已被卖出时，不禁目瞪口呆。","This came as a great shock to Wace, and he began to reproach himself bitterly for having neglected the plain symptoms of the old man’s ill-health.But his chief thought was of the crystal.He approached that topic in a gingerly manner, because he knew Mrs. Cave’s peculiarities.He was dumfounded to learn that it was sold."
"凯夫先生的尸体被抬上楼之后，凯夫太太的第一反应就是马上给那个出价五英镑来买水晶的疯狂牧师写信，通知他水晶已经找到了。但是和她女儿一起疯狂地搜寻了一番之后，她们确信已经把他的地址弄丢了。因为没钱，他们不能像一位七盘商业区老居民的尊严所要求的那样来隆重地操办凯夫先生的后事，只好请求大波特兰街一位好心的商人帮忙。他大发善心，估过价之后便从店里买走了一部分存货。这是他自己估的价，而那只水晶蛋也在那一堆东西里面。韦斯先生说了几句哀悼的话，也许只是随便敷衍而已，之后他便急忙赶去大波特兰街。但到了那儿之后，他得知那只水晶蛋已经卖给了一个穿着灰色衣服的黑皮肤、高个子男人。至此，这个奇怪的、对我来说至少有些启发性的故事的主要情节就戛然而止了。大波特兰街的商人不认识那位穿着灰色衣服的黑皮肤、高个子男人，也没有足够认真地观察过他，因此无法准确描述他的长相。他甚至不知道那个人离开之后朝哪边走了。韦斯先生在他店里呆了一会儿，无望地问了一些问题，消磨着那位商人的耐心，也发泄着他自己的恼怒。最后，他突然意识到自己已经无能为力了，整件事情就像夜晚的幻觉一样消失了。他回到自己的房间，惊奇地发现在他那张狼籍的桌子上，以前做的笔记还是清晰可见。","Mrs. Cave’s first impulse, directly Cave’s body had been taken upstairs, had been to write to the mad clergyman who had offered five pounds for the crystal, informing him of its recovery; but after a violent hunt, in which her daughter joined her, they were convinced of the loss of his address.As they were without the means required to mourn and bury Cave in the elaborate style the dignity of an old Seven Dials inhabitant demands, they had appealed to a friendly fellow-tradesman in Great Portland Street.He had very kindly taken over a portion of the stock at a valuation.The valuation was his own, and the crystal egg was included in one of the lots.Mr. Wace, after a few suitable condolences, a little off-handedly proffered perhaps, hurried at once to Great Portland Street.But there he learned that the crystal egg had already been sold to a tall, dark man in grey.And there the material facts in this curious, and to me at least very suggestive, story come abruptly to an end.The Great Portland Street dealer did not know who the tall dark man in grey was, nor had he observed him with sufficient attention to describe him minutely.He did not even know which way this person had gone after leaving the shop.For a time Mr. Wace remained in the shop, trying the dealer’s patience with hopeless questions, venting his own exasperation.And at last, realising abruptly that the whole thing had passed out of his hands, had vanished like a vision of the night, he returned to his own rooms, a little astonished to find the notes he had made still tangible and visible upon, his untidy table."
"当然他感到非常生气、非常失望。他再一次拜访了大波特兰街的那位商人，同样没有任何收获。他还试着在一些古玩收藏家经常阅读的期刊上登了广告。他还向《每日消息》和《自然》写了信，但这两份期刊都怀疑他是在开玩笑，请他在期刊刊印前反思自己的行为，还劝告他说，这样一个奇怪而缺乏足够证据的故事会损坏他作为一名研究人员的名誉。而且，他还有许多自己的工作要忙。于是大约一个月之后，除了偶尔向一些商人提起这件事外，他不得不放弃寻找那个水晶蛋，到现在为止还是没有找到它。不过，他告诉我（我还是可以相信他的），他偶尔还是会爆发热情，把他手头紧迫的工作放到一边，继续寻找那块水晶。","His annoyance and disappointment were naturally very great.He made a second call (equally ineffectual) upon the Great Portland Street dealer, and he resorted to advertisements in such periodicals as were lively to come into the hands of a bric-a-brac collector.He also wrote letters to The Daily Chronicle and Nature, but both those periodicals, suspecting a hoax, asked him to reconsider his action before they printed, and he was advised that such a strange story, unfortunately so bare of supporting evidence, might imperil his reputation as an investigator.Moreover, the calls of his proper work were urgent.So that after a month or so, save for an occasional reminder to certain dealers, he had reluctantly to abandon the quest for the crystal egg, and from that day to this it remains undiscovered.Occasionally, however, he tells me, and I can quite believe him, he has bursts of zeal, in which he abandons his more urgent occupation and resumes the search."
"是否永远都找不到它了？它是什么材料做的？来自哪里？这些问题目前还都是谜团。如果现在的买主是一位收藏家的话，估计韦斯先生寻找这块水晶的事已经通过商人传到他耳朵里了。他已经知道，找过凯夫先生的牧师和那位东方人——不是别人，正是爪哇的詹姆斯·帕克教士和年轻的波索·库尼王子。","Whether or not it will remain lost for ever, with the material and origin of it, are things equally speculative at the present time.If the present purchaser is a collector, one would have expected the enquiries of Mr. Wace to have reached him through the dealers.He has been able to discover Mr. Cave’s clergyman and “Oriental”—no other than the Rev. James Parker and the young Prince of Bosso-Kuni in Java."
"我感谢他们向我提供了一些细节。那位王子只是出于好奇而已——也想挥霍一把。他想买那块水晶只是因为凯夫先生很奇怪地执意不肯卖出。也可能第二次的那个买主根本不是收藏家，只是随随便便地把它买回去了。据我所知，这个水晶蛋也许就在我周围一英里之内，在一间画室里作装饰，或是被当作镇纸来用——它的奇妙功能还是没人发现。实际上，我之所以用这种形式来说这个故事，部分是考虑到买主可能不是收藏家，好让一般的小说读者也有机会读到它。","I am obliged to them for certain particulars.The object of the Prince was simply curiosity—and extravagance.He was so eager to buy because Cave was so oddly reluctant to sell.It is just as possible that the buyer in the second instance was simply a casual purchaser and not a collector at all, and the crystal egg, for all I know, may at the present moment be within a mile of me, decorating a drawing-room or serving as a paper-weight—its remarkable functions all unknown.Indeed, it is partly with the idea of such a possibility that I have thrown this narrative into a form that will give it a chance of being read by the ordinary consumer of fiction."
"我自己对这件事情的看法与韦斯先生完全一致。我认为火星的杆子上挂着的水晶和凯夫先生的水晶蛋有着某种物理联系，不过目前还无法解释清楚。我们两人还认为地球上的这块水晶很有可能是很久以前从火星发射到地球上来的，以便让火星人从近处了解地球上的事情。也许挂在其他杆子上的水晶在我们星球上也有同伴。没有什么关于幻觉的理论可以解释这种现象。","My own ideas in the matter are practically identical with those of Mr. Wace.I believe the crystal on the mast in Mars and the crystal egg of Mr. Cave’s to be in some physical, but at present quite inexplicable, way en rapport, and we both believe further that the terrestrial crystal must have been—possibly at some remote date—sent hither from that planet, in order to give the Martians a near view of our affairs.Possibly the fellows to the crystals on the other masts are also on our globe.No theory of hallucination suffices for the facts."
