"决斗","The Duel"
"作者：欧·亨利","by O. Henry"
"众神躺在奥林匹斯山上，有琼浆玉液相伴，他们从悬崖边窥视，觉察到了城市间的一丝差异。尽管也许在他们看来，城市就是些没有特色、大小不一的蚁丘，然而事实并非如此。神话里讲，佳酿是诸神唯一的慰藉。于这样的高度一边饮佳酿一边观察蚂蚁们的习性只是他们的小消遣罢了。但毫无疑问，他们通过比较乡村和城市来自娱自乐；对他们来说（或许也是对于许多凡人来说），在世界所有的城市中，纽约独一无二。而这便将是这个小故事的主题。故事讲给坐在椅子上抽烟的男人，他穿着只有安息日才穿的拖鞋，脚搭在另一张椅子上，也讲给偷空看报纸的女人，此时她正在煮青菜，婴儿也已经熟睡了，不再缠着她了。我愿意和这样的人一起坐在地上，给他们讲述国王们驾崩的悲惨故事。","The gods, lying beside their nectar on ’Lympus and peeping over the edge of the cliff, perceive a difference in cities.Although it would seem that to their vision towns must appear as large or small ant-hills without special characteristics, yet it is not so.Studying the habits of ants from so great a height should be but a mild diversion when coupled with the soft drink that mythology tells us is their only solace.But doubtless they have amused themselves by the comparison of villages and towns; and it will be no news to them (nor, perhaps, to many mortals), that in one particularity New York stands unique among the cities of the world.This shall be the theme of a little story addressed to the man who sits smoking with his Sabbath-slippered feet on another chair, and to the woman who snatches the paper for a moment while boiling greens or a narcotized baby leaves her free.With these I love to sit upon the ground and tell sad stories of the death of Kings."
"纽约城居住着四百万神秘的陌生人；比天堂多出三百万，外加半打缪斯女神们。他们通过不同的方式，出于种种理由，来到这里——亨德里克·赫德森、艺术学校、新鲜蔬菜、鹳鸟、服装设计师的年度大会、宾夕法尼亚铁路公司、对金钱的热爱、舞台、低廉的游览收费率、智慧、个人专栏广告、笨重的旅行鞋、雄心壮志、货运列车——这一切都助长了人口数量的增加。","New York City is inhabited by 4,000,000 mysterious strangers; thus beating Bird Centre by three millions and half a dozen nine’s.They came here in various ways and for many reasons—Hendrik Hudson, the art schools, green goods, the stork, the annual dressmakers’ convention, the Pennsylvania Railroad, love of money, the stage, cheap excursion rates, brains, personal column ads., heavy walking shoes, ambition, freight trains—all these have had a hand in making up the population."
"但是每一个普通人，从他踏上曼哈顿的那一刻起，就不得不为生存而战。他必须马上开始战斗，直到和对手分出胜负。回合之间没有休息，因为就没有回合可言。一开头就是重击。一战到底。","But every man Jack when he first sets foot on the stones of Manhattan has got to fight.He has got to fight at once until either he or his adversary wins.There is no resting between rounds, for there are no rounds.It is slugging from the first.It is a fight to a finish."
"你的对手是这座城市。从渡船载你登上岛屿的那刻起，你就要和它作战，直到你征服它，或者它征服你。你口袋里有一百万也好，仅有一周住宿的钱也好，都一样。","Your opponent is the City.You must do battle with it from the time the ferry-boat lands you on the island until either it is yours or it has conquered you.It is the same whether you have a million in your pocket or only the price of a week’s lodging."
"这场战争将决定你是会成为一个纽约市民还是变成最卑微的外来人员和平庸之辈。你必须在这两者之间作一个选择。不可保持中立。你必须顺应或者对抗——成为爱人或者敌人——知己或被驱逐者。还有，哦，这座城市是拳击场上的一员猛将。它不仅用猛击来制服你。它还用塞壬的精明来笼络你。它是德莉拉、绿色的荨麻酒、贝多芬、麻醉剂和辉煌时期的约翰·劳的结合体。","The battle is to decide whether you shall become a New Yorker or turn the rankest outlander and Philistine.You must be one or the other.You cannot remain neutral.You must be for or against—lover or enemy—bosom friend or outcast.And, oh, the city is a general in the ring.Not only by blows does it seek to subdue you.It woos you to its heart with the subtlety of a siren.It is a combination of Delilah, green Chartreuse, Beethoven, chloral and John L. in his best days."
"在其他城市里你可以作为陌生人到处闲逛逗留，只要你愿意，想呆多久呆多久。在芝加哥你可以住到头发花白，如果波士顿宠爱你，接纳你成为它的市民，你可以空谈瞎扯却免遭指责。除了纽约，你可以成为其他任何一座城市的核心人物，也能总公开嘲笑它的建筑物，把它们和你家乡密西西比州杰克逊市特尔菲尔上校的住处相提并论，且不会遭到攻击。可是在纽约，你要么是纽约人，要么就是有着自以为是的褊狭、藏在木马里的现代特洛伊城的入侵者。这段沉闷的序言只是为了向你们介绍两个无名小卒——威廉和杰克。","In other cities you may wander and abide as a stranger man as long as you please.You may live in Chicago until your hair whitens, and be a citizen and still prate of beans if Boston mothered you, and without rebuke.You may become a civic pillar in any other town but Knickerbocker’s, and all the time publicly sneering at its buildings, comparing them with the architecture of Colonel Telfair’s residence in Jackson, Miss., whence you hail, and you will not be set upon.But in New York you must be either a New Yorker or an invader of a modern Troy, concealed in the wooden horse of your conceited provincialism.And this dreary preamble is only to introduce to you the unimportant figures of William and Jack."
"他们是一起从西部来的老朋友。他们来这里是为了能这座大城市中发财致富。","They came out of the West together, where they had been friends.They came to dig their fortunes out of the big city."
"尼克波克大爷(纽约市的别号)在渡口与他们相见，右手冲着一人的鼻子出了直拳，左手给了另一个人一记上勾拳，这只是为了告诉他们，战斗开始了。","Father Knickerbocker met them at the ferry, giving one a right-hander on the nose and the other an upper-cut with his left, just to let them know that the fight was on."
"威廉打算从商；杰克想搞艺术。他俩都年轻气盛，斗志昂扬；所以都扭住对手予以反击。我想他们来自内布拉斯加州，也可能是密苏里州或明尼苏达州。无论如何，他们是来追求成功和财富的，他俩就像两个洛金瓦那样，配戴着指节铜套，一路来到市政厅，给这个城市来了个措手不及。","William was for business; Jack was for Art.Both were young and ambitious; so they countered and clinched.I think they were from Nebraska or possibly Missouri or Minnesota.Anyhow, they were out for success and scraps and scads, and they tackled the city like two Lochinvars with brass knucks and a pull at the City Hall."
"四年过去了，威廉和杰克相约共进午餐。商人威廉风风火火地进了餐馆，把他的丝质礼帽扔给服务员，一下子坐到服务员推给他的椅子上，接着又拿起菜单，一直点到奶酪时，艺术家才有机会对他点点头。点头之后，艺术家眼里露出了幽默的笑意。","Four years afterward William and Jack met at luncheon.The business man blew in like a March wind, hurled his silk hat at a waiter, dropped into the chair that was pushed under him, seized the bill of fare, and had ordered as far as cheese before the artist had time to do more than nod.After the nod a humorous smile came into his eyes."
"“比利，”他说，“你被击败了。城市已将你吞噬。它抓住了你，并以它的模式改造了你，在你身上烙了属于它的印记。你几乎就和我今天所见的成千上万的人一样，如果不是洗衣店的标签，都没法把你区分出来。”","“Billy,” he said, “you’re done for.The city has gobbled you up.It has taken you and cut you to its pattern and stamped you with its brand.You are so nearly like ten thousand men I have seen to-day that you couldn’t be picked out from them if it weren’t for your laundry marks.”"
"“卡门贝干酪，”威廉点完了，“你说什么？哦，你还在同纽约较量，是吧？哎，地铁旁古老的噪音小村落够善待我了。它给了我属于我的东西。过去，我认为西部就是整个地球——只不过在布赖恩旋转时，两极才略为平衡一点儿。我过去总是声嘶力竭地嚷着西部如何富裕辽阔，也曾经自视甚高，在杂货店里挖苦来自东部的肥皂推销员。可我那时从没见过纽约，杰克。纽约从地下餐厅到地面的一切似乎都是为我而设的。如今，第六大道对我来说就是西部。你曾听过那个克鲁索唱歌吗？他愿意呆在荒岛上，可我妻子让我离开那里。我能随时看到梅·欧文和E. S. 威拉德的表演。”","“Camembert,” finished William.“What’s that?Oh, you’ve still got your hammer out for New York, have you?Well, little old Noisyville-on-the-Subway is good enough for me.It’s giving me mine.And, say, I used to think the West was the whole round world—only slightly flattened at the poles whenever Bryan ran.I used to yell myself hoarse about the free expense, and hang my hat on the horizon, and say cutting things in the grocery to little soap drummers from the East.But I’d never seen New York, then, Jack.Me for it from the rathskellers up.Sixth Avenue is the West to me now.Have you heard this fellow Crusoe sing?The desert isle for him, I say, but my wife made me go.Give me May Irwin or E. S. Willard any time.”"
"“可怜的比利，”艺术家优雅地夹着一根香烟，说道，“你记得吧，来东部的路上时，我们是怎样评价这座伟大神奇的城市，我们又是怎样计划着征服它，绝不让他占上风？我们曾打算和以前一样，绝不让它掌控我们。它已经把你打败了，老朋友。你已经从一个特立独行的人变成一个巴结奉承的人。”","“Poor Billy,” said the artist, delicately fingering a cigarette.“You remember, when we were on our way to the East how we talked about this great, wonderful city, and how we meant to conquer it and never let it get the best of us?We were going to be just the same fellows we had always been, and never let it master us.It has downed you, old man.You have changed from a maverick into a butterick.”"
"“不能完全理解你在说什么，”威廉说，“我不会像过去在家那样，在正式场合穿蓝裤子、羊驼皮大衣和泡泡纱背心。你说我已被它的模式改造了——好吧，难道这种模式不好吗？你要入乡随俗。在我看来，其他所谓的大都市和这座城市比起来，简直就是信号车站。据我所记得的列车时刻表，芝加哥、圣乔和法国巴黎都是信号停车站——也就是说每隔一周的礼拜二，你要在车站挥挥红旗，才可以坐上火车。我喜欢这个位于哈得孙河畔的塔利顿的小郊区。这里总会有些事情发生，总得有些人在。我卖自动水泵，每年净收入有八千美元，我生活得就像国王一样。哎，昨天，我还被引荐给约翰·W. 盖茨。我和一个酒类代理商的妹妹一起坐过汽车。我曾见过有两个人被电车碾过的情景，也曾在晚上观看过埃德娜·梅的演出。说到西部，哎，有天晚上，我在宾馆里大声叫喊，吵醒了那里的每一个人。我曾梦见过我在奥什科什的一段木板铺成的人行道上散步。你对这座城市哪里不满意，杰克？我只对这里的一样不满意，那就是渡船。”","“Don’t see exactly what you are driving at,” said William.“I don’t wear an alpaca coat with blue trousers and a seersucker vest on dress occasions, like I used to do at home.You talk about being cut to a pattern—well, ain’t the pattern all right?When you’re in Rome you’ve got to do as the Dagoes do.This town seems to me to have other alleged metropolises skinned to flag stations.According to the railroad schedule I’ve got in mind, Chicago and Saint Jo and Paris, France, are asterisk stops—which means you wave a red flag and get on every other Tuesday.I like this little suburb of Tarrytown-on-the-Hudson.There’s something or somebody doing all the time.I’m clearing $8,000 a year selling automatic pumps, and I’m living like kings-up.Why, yesterday, I was introduced to John W. Gates.I took an auto ride with a wine agent’s sister.I saw two men run over by a street car, and I seen Edna May play in the evening.Talk about the West, why, the other night I woke everybody up in the hotel hollering.I dreamed I was walking on a board sidewalk in Oshkosh.What have you got against this town, Jack?There’s only one thing in it that I don’t care for, and that’s a ferryboat.”"
"艺术家眼神朦胧地凝视着墙上的图画纸。“这座城市，”他说，“是条水蛭。它吸干了国家的血。无论谁来此地都要接受与它决斗的挑战。抛开水蛭的形象，它就是摧毁一切的力量，是摩洛神，是一个怪物，这块土地上单纯无知的人、天才和美丽的人必须向它致敬。新来者必须同心协力，共同与这个怪物搏斗。你已失败了，比利。但它却永远征服不了我。我憎恨它，就像一个人憎恨犯罪、瘟疫，或者——一本十美分杂志中的彩色插画一样。我蔑视它的广袤和力量。在我见过的所有城市中，它有最贫穷的百万富翁，最低的摩天大楼和最无味的乐趣。它吸引了你，老朋友，但是我将永远不会与它的车轮并驾齐驱。我可以容忍一个城市被财富或者贵族所统治；但但这座城市却是被其地位最低的人控制着。它宣称自己有教养，它却最庸俗的；它郑重申明自己很出色，它却是最卑劣的；它否定外界的价值观和道德观，它却是最狭隘的。我要西部纯洁的、开阔的胸襟。如果可以，我想明天就回那里。”","The artist gazed dreamily at the cartridge paper on the wall.“This town,” said he, “is a leech.It drains the blood of the country.Whoever comes to it accepts a challenge to a duel.Abandoning the figure of the leech, it is a juggernaut, a Moloch, a monster to which the innocence, the genius, and the beauty of the land must pay tribute.Hand to hand every newcomer must struggle with the leviathan.You’ve lost, Billy.It shall never conquer me.I hate it as one hates sin or pestilence or—the color work in a ten-cent magazine.I despise its very vastness and power.It has the poorest millionaires, the littlest great men, the lowest skyscrapers, the dolefulest pleasures of any town I ever saw.It has caught you, old man, but I will never run beside its chariot wheels.I could stand a town ruled by wealth or one ruled by an aristocracy; but this is one controlled by its lowest ingredients.Claiming culture, it is the crudest; asseverating its pre-eminence, it is the basest; denying all outside values and virtue, it is the narrowest.Give me the pure and the open heart of the West country.I would go back there to-morrow if I could.”"
"“难道你不喜欢烤里脊肉这道菜吗？”威廉说，“无聊，现在，贬损这个城市有什么用！它是最伟大的。在萨克拉门托，从哈里斯堡到汤米·奥基夫的市场，我一台自动水泵都卖不出去，可是在这里我卖了二十台。你看过萨拉·伯恩哈特表演的《安德鲁·麦克》吗？”","“Don’t you like this @filet mignon?@” said William.“Shucks, now, what’s the use to knock the town!It’s the greatest ever.I couldn’t sell one automatic pump between Harrisburg and Tommy O’Keefe’s saloon, in Sacramento, where I sell twenty here.And have you seen Sara Bernhardt in ‘Andrew Mack’ yet?”"
"“你已经败给这座城市了，比利。”杰克说。","“The town’s got you, Billy,” said Jack."
"“好吧，”威廉说，“我明年夏天想要在隆空科马湖畔购置一幢别墅。”","“All right,” said William.“I’m going to buy a cottage on Lake Ronkonkoma next summer.”"
"午夜时分，杰克打开窗户，坐在窗边。看到的景象令他屏住了呼吸，尽管他感受这样的场景不止一百次了。","At midnight Jack raised his window and sat close to it.He caught his breath at what he saw, though he had seen and felt it a hundred times."
"这座城市远远地躺在下面，就像一个参差不齐的紫色的梦。不规则的房子就像是悬崖的断裂面，悬崖下是纵深的峡谷和蜿蜒的河流。有些房子好似一座座山丘，有些则像位于长长的、荒凉的峡谷之中。这就是这座奇妙的、残忍的、让人着迷又困惑的、致命而又伟大的城市的背景。而这种背景被多彩的灯光切割成灿烂的平行四边形、圆形和正方形。从这种蓝紫色和紫色的深径中升腾起声音、气味和激动，它们如同城市的灵魂，组成了市民主体。纵情欢娱，爱恨情仇和他们所有的情感欲望的气息在上升。他下面有一切或好或坏的东西，它们从世界各个角落而来，给人带来启迪、欢乐、刺激、富裕、掠夺、提升、削弱、养育或谋杀。如此，这座城市的气息飘向他，渗入他的血液中。","Far below and around lay the city like a ragged purple dream.The irregular houses were like the broken exteriors of cliffs lining deep gulches and winding streams.Some were mountainous; some lay in long, desert canons.Such was the background of the wonderful, cruel, enchanting, bewildering, fatal, great city.But into this background were cut myriads of brilliant parallelograms and circles and squares through which glowed many colored lights.And out of the violet and purple depths ascended like the city’s soul sounds and odors and thrills that make up the civic body.There arose the breath of gaiety unrestrained, of love, of hate, of all the passions that man can know.There below him lay all things, good or bad, that can be brought from the four corners of the earth to instruct, please, thrill, enrich, despoil, elevate, cast down, nurture or kill.Thus the flavor of it came up to him and went into his blood."
"有敲门声。是一份写给他的电报。它是从西部寄过来的，上面写着：","There was a knock on his door.A telegram had come for him.It came from the West, and these were its words: "
"“回来，同意。","“Come back and the answer will be yes."
"多莉。”","Dolly.”"
"他让那个男孩等了十分钟，然后回复：“目前不可能离开这里。”之后，他又坐在了窗户前，任凭这座城市将那杯曼陀罗草茶送到他的唇边。","He kept the boy waiting ten minutes, and then wrote the reply: “Impossible to leave here at present.”Then he sat at the window again and let the city put its cup of mandragora to his lips again."
"这毕竟不是个故事，然而我想知道这两个主人公在和城市的决斗中谁取得了胜利。所以我拜访了一个很有学问的朋友，让他作论断。可他却说：“请不要打扰我，我要去买圣诞礼物。”","After all it isn’t a story; but I wanted to know which one of the heroes won the battle against the city.So I went to a very learned friend and laid the case before him.What he said was: “Please don’t bother me; I have Christmas presents to buy.”"
"故事就到这里了，读者得自己来决定（谁赢了这场决斗）了。","So there it rests; and you will have to decide for yourself."
