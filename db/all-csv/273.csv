"西尔弗·埃瑟里奇","Sylph Etherege"
"作者：纳撒尼尔·霍桑","by Nathaniel Hawthorne"
"在一个明朗的夏日夜晚，有两个人站在一座花园里的灌木丛中，偷偷观察一位坐在隔壁公寓窗前的年轻女孩。这两个暗中观察的人中，有一位是个年轻的绅士。他举止高雅、风度翩翩，尽管相貌平平，但脸上透着机智。当他用自己修长的食指指着那个女孩时，他的脸上甚至显现出一种邪恶的神情，尽管也有些许的喜悦；他似乎觉得她已经完全处于自己的掌控之中了。","On a bright summer evening, two persons stood among the shrubbery of a garden, stealthily watching a young girl, who sat in the window seat of a neighboring mansion.One of these unseen observers, a gentleman, was youthful, and had an air of high breeding and refinement, and a face marked with intellect, though otherwise of unprepossessing aspect.His features wore even an ominous, though somewhat mirthful expression, while he pointed his long forefinger at the girl, and seemed to regard her as a creature completely within the scope of his influence."
"“魔法起作用了！”他小声说，声音虽小，却很有力。","“The charm works!” said he, in a low, but emphatic whisper."
"“你知道吗，爱德华·汉密尔顿——既然你选择叫这个名字——你知道吗，”他身旁的夫人说道，“我恨不得立刻打破你的符咒？要是这样的教训后果太严重怎么办！的确，如果嘲弄可以使我的被监护人摆脱她那毫无意义的幻想，她也许会因此获益终身。可话又说回来，她的身体这么娇弱！而且，你搞出这么个影子情敌，就不怕断送了自己的机会吗？”","“Do you know, Edward Hamilton,—since so you choose to be named,—do you know,” said the lady beside him, “that I have almost a mind to break the spell at once?What if the lesson should prove too severe!True, if my ward could be thus laughed out of her fantastic nonsense, she might be the better for it through life.But then, she is such a delicate creature!And, besides, are you not ruining your own chance, by putting forward this shadow of a rival?”"
"“只要我一声令下，他立刻就会消失得无影无踪，不是吗？”爱德华·汉密尔顿反驳道，“让魔法发挥力量吧！”","“But will he not vanish into thin air, at my bidding?” rejoined Edward Hamilton.“Let the charm work!”"
"这个女孩的身材苗条，如空气精灵般轻盈，在晚霞灿烂的光辉里，在丝绸窗帘华丽的帷幔映衬下，她静坐在深陷的窗棱中，这真是一幅完美无瑕的图画。或者说，它更像画家幻想中的美妙原型，最精美的画作在它面前也会相形见绌。她只不过在凝视手里的一幅用白色绸缎和红色摩洛哥皮革包裹的小画像，但她的这一举动激起了两位观察者的浓厚兴趣。汉密尔顿打量她时，脸上露出嘲弄和恶意的笑容，正是因为看到她在凝视画像。","The girl’s slender and sylph-like figure, tinged with radiance from the sunset clouds, and overhung with the rich drapery of the silken curtains, and set within the deep frame of the window, was a perfect picture; or, rather, it was like the original loveliness in a painter’s fancy, from which the most finished picture is but an imperfect copy.Though her occupation excited so much interest in the two spectators, she was merely gazing at a miniature which she held in her hand, encased in white satin and red morocco; nor did there appear to be any other cause for the smile of mockery and malice with which Hamilton regarded her."
"“魔法生效了！”他又喃喃地说道，“我们漂亮的西尔维亚将会为她对我的不屑付出沉重的代价！”","“The charm works!” muttered he, again.“Our pretty Sylvia’s scorn will have a dear retribution!”"
"这时，女孩抬起双眸，映入她眼帘的不是与那幅小肖像画相似的鲜活形象，而是爱德华·汉密尔顿那不详的身影，现在他从藏身的灌木丛中走了出来。","At this moment the girl raised her eyes, and, instead of a life-like semblance of the miniature, beheld the ill-omened shape of Edward Hamilton, who now stepped forth from his concealment in the shrubbery."
"西尔维亚·埃瑟里奇是个孤女，直到几个月前，她还一直在一位单身老伯的监护下过着离群索居的生活。当她还在摇篮里时就已经注定要成为一位表兄的新娘，其实他和她一样，对于婚约身不由己。他们未来的结合被当作是一种联合双方丰厚家产的手段，而且双方父母也都在遗嘱中传达了这样的意思，即尽管不一定非得这样做，但他们的结合十分有利。埃德加·沃恩，这位未来的新郎，自幼在欧洲长大，从未见过这位注定要把心交付给他的美丽女孩。但是，几年来，这对表兄妹一直保持着书信联系，这使他们之间产生了一种思想上的亲近，可是他们却不可能完全了解对方的性格。","Sylvia Etherege was an orphan girl, who had spent her life, till within a few months past, under the guardianship, and in the secluded dwelling, of an old bachelor uncle.While yet in her cradle, she had been the destined bride of a cousin, who was no less passive in the betrothal than herself.Their future union had been projected, as the means of uniting two rich estates, and was rendered highly expedient, if not indispensable, by the testamentary dispositions of the parents on both sides.Edgar Vaughan, the promised bridegroom, had been bred from infancy in Europe, and had never seen the beautiful girl whose heart he was to claim as his inheritance.But already, for several years, a correspondence had been kept up between tine cousins, and had produced an intellectual intimacy, though it could but imperfectly acquaint them with each other’s character."
"西尔维亚羞涩、敏感、喜欢幻想。由于她监护人喜欢隐居的生活习惯，使得她甚至接触不到她那个年纪的少女们生活的世界。她只好在想象的世界中为自己寻找伙伴和朋友，有时用已故诗人的语言，更多的时候用自己心灵的诗句与他们交谈。她首先在想象中召唤的同伴就是这位表兄，她最早就是同他交流自己的想法。她想象出了埃德加·沃恩的样子，又在幻想中浓墨重彩地描绘他，使他不仅仅是一幅幻想的图画，她还赋予了他许多高尚、美好的优点，使他尽善尽美，她的表兄到哪里也不会遇到一位像她幻想中那样危险的情敌。她对于这一幻影怀有浪漫的忠贞之情。当这个缥缈虚幻的形象坐在她的身旁，或是悄悄穿过她钟爱的小径时，她那孤独而年轻的心就会感到幸福。她的心灵因为爱而感到满足，而她那少女的贞洁还未被世俗玷污，如果与她接触的是真实的情人，他很可能已经在那里留下了印迹。埃德加·沃恩似乎了解她的性格，因为他在信中给她起了一个名字，对于她敏感的性情、独特的优雅举止和那由内而外流露出的超凡美丽而言，这个名字真是再贴切不过了。他没有叫她西尔维亚，而是以表兄和情人的特权称呼她为西尔弗——他亲爱的西尔弗·埃瑟里奇。","Sylvia was shy, sensitive, and fanciful; and her guardian’s secluded habits had shut her out from even so much of the world as is generally open to maidens of her age.She had been left to seek associates and friends for herself in the haunts of imagination, and to converse with them, sometimes in the language of dead poets, oftener in the poetry of her own mind.The companion whom she chiefly summoned up was the cousin with whose idea her earliest thoughts had been connected.She made a vision of Edgar Vaughan, and tinted it with stronger hues than a mere fancy-picture, yet graced it with so many bright and delicate perfections, that her cousin could nowhere have encountered so dangerous a rival.To this shadow she cherished a romantic fidelity.With its airy presence sitting by her side, or gliding along her favorite paths, the loneliness of her young life was blissful; her heart was satisfied with love, while yet its virgin purity was untainted by the earthliness that the touch of a real lover would have left there.Edgar Vaughan seemed to be conscious of her character; for, in his letters, he gave her a name that was happily appropriate to the sensitiveness of her disposition, the delicate peculiarity of her manners, and the ethereal beauty both of her mind and person.Instead of Sylvia, he called her Sylph,—with the prerogative of a cousin and a lover,—his dear Sylph Etherege."
"在西尔维亚十七岁时，她的监护人去世了，随后格罗夫纳夫人成了她的新监护人。这位富有的女士来自上流社会，虽然她只是西尔维亚的远房亲戚，却是和她关系最亲近的亲戚了。她虽然和格罗夫纳夫人一家同住，却仍然保留着她终生的独处习惯，也不愿与身边的人有太过密切的往来。她也仍然忠于她的表兄，或者说是那个以他名字命名的幻影。","When Sylvia was seventeen, her guardian died, and she passed under the care of Mrs. Grosvenor, a lady of wealth and fashion, and Sylvia’s nearest relative, though a distant one.While an inmate of Mrs. Grosvenor’s family, she still preserved somewhat of her life-long habits of seclusion, and shrank from a too familiar intercourse with those around her.Still, too, she was faithful to her cousin, or to the shadow which bore his name."
"埃德加·沃恩学业的最后阶段以周游各地收尾。如今旅行结束了，他就要回到他出生的故土了。这位年轻的绅士，爱德华·汉密尔顿曾经陪伴沃恩学习和旅行。他已经再次横渡大西洋，把书信带给格罗夫纳夫人和西尔维亚·埃瑟里奇。这些书信使他受到了诚挚的欢迎，但西尔维亚似乎并没有对他表现出个人的偏爱，甚至都没有因为他是表兄最亲密的朋友而对他有所关注。她自己也无法解释对他的反感，这也许是所谓的本能吧。的确，汉密尔顿的相貌毫无魅力可言，尤其是他留给别人的第一印象。但是，即使是在最挑剔的评判者看来，他那优雅的举止和黝黑面容上时常流露出的睿智也足以弥补他天生的相貌缺陷了。格罗夫纳夫人很快就非常喜欢他，便竭尽全力地想消除西尔维亚对他的厌恶。但是，在这件事上，她的被监护人既不听她讲道理，也不听她劝说。只要爱德华·汉密尔顿一出现，她一定会变得冷漠、羞怯和疏远，完全失去了平日的活泼欢快，仿佛一片乌云遮住了她头上的阳光。","The time now drew near when Edgar Vaughan, whose education had been completed by an extensive range of travel, was to revisit the soil of his nativity.Edward Hamilton, a young gentleman, who had been Vaughan’s companion, both in his studies and rambles, had already recrossed the Atlantic, bringing letters to Mrs. Grosvenor and Sylvia Etherege.These credentials insured him an earnest welcome, which, however, on Sylvia’s part, was not followed by personal partiality, or even the regard that seemed due to her cousin’s most intimate friend.As she herself could have assigned no cause for her repugnance, it might be termed instinctive.Hamilton’s person, it is true, was the reverse of attractive, especially when beheld for the first time.Yet, in the eyes of the most fastidious judges, the defect of natural grace was compensated by the polish of his manners, and by the intellect which so often gleamed through his dark features.Mrs. Grosvenor, with whom he immediately became a prodigious favorite, exerted herself to overcome Sylvia’s dislike.But, in this matter, her ward could neither be reasoned with nor persuaded.The presence of Edward Hamilton was sure to render her cold, shy, and distant, abstracting all the vivacity from her deportment, as if a cloud had come betwixt her and the sunshine."
"西尔维亚率真的举止，让汉密尔顿这般敏锐的观察者很容易就能察觉出她的情感。无论何时，只要一点风吹草动让他察觉到她的情感，这个年轻人蜡黄的面颊上就会闪过一丝微笑。他的微笑让人过目难忘。每当人们回想起爱德华·汉密尔顿的模样，脑海中总能隐隐浮现出这种带着些许恶意和嘲笑的表情。","The simplicity of Sylvia’s demeanor rendered it easy for so keen an observer as Hamilton to detect her feelings.Whenever any slight circumstance made him sensible of them, a smile might be seen to flit over the young man’s sallow visage.None, that had once beheld this smile, were in any danger of forgetting it; whenever they recalled to memory the features of Edward Hamilton, they were always duskily illuminated by this expression of mockery and malice."
"汉密尔顿到来几周之后，交给西尔维亚·埃瑟里奇一幅她表兄的小画像，他告诉她说，本该早点交给她的，可是装画像的行李托运延误了。这正是我们在故事一开始时所提到的那幅西尔维亚全神贯注凝视着的画像。这的确是这个喜欢沉思的羞涩女孩极为常见的习惯。人类是个堕落的种族，为世俗所累，在平凡的烦恼和快乐中度过一生，面容也必定会因年老和操劳而布满皱纹，但画像里的美丽面容却近乎完美，实在不像是一个人间凡人。那种美丽太光彩夺目，与生于尘土且终要归于尘土的凡人太不相称。西尔维亚担心这么一个彬彬有礼、举止文雅的人不会爱上像她这么单纯的女孩。然而，即使在她因忧虑而情绪低落的时候，西尔弗·埃瑟里奇那精灵般的美丽也丝毫不逊色于画像中的男性阳刚之美。据说命中注定的恋人，容貌常会相似，她的面容和小画像中的人有些相似之处，不过对于他们这种情况来说，可能是双方有血缘关系的缘故。实际上，西尔维亚觉得画像上的面孔有些似曾相识，就像一位朋友，那微笑的眼睛似乎在说他懂得她的心思。对于这种感觉，她只能这样来解释：在她的那些白日梦里，她幻想出了远隔千里、未曾谋面的恋人的真实模样。","In a few weeks after Hamilton’s arrival, he presented to Sylvia Etherege a miniature of her cousin, which, as he informed her, would have been delivered sooner, but was detained with a portion of his baggage.This was the miniature in the contemplation of which we beheld Sylvia so absorbed, at the commencement of our story.Such, in truth, was too often the habit of the shy and musing girl.The beauty of the pictured countenance was almost too perfect to represent a human creature, that had been born of a fallen and world-worn race, and had lived to manhood amid ordinary troubles and enjoyments, and must become wrinkled with age and care.It seemed too bright for a thing formed of dust, and doomed to crumble into dust again.Sylvia feared that such a being would be too refined and delicate to love a simple girl like her.Yet, even while her spirit drooped with that apprehension, the picture was but the masculine counterpart of Sylph Etherege’s sylphlike beauty.There was that resemblance between her own face and the miniature which is said often to exist between lovers whom Heaven has destined for each other, and which, in this instance, might be owing to the kindred blood of the two parties.Sylvia felt, indeed, that there was something familiar in the countenance, so like a friend did the eyes smile upon her, and seem to imply a knowledge of her thoughts.She could account for this impression only by supposing that, in some of her day-dreams, imagination had conjured up the true similitude of her distant and unseen lover."
"但是，西尔维亚现在能够赋予那些幻想中的身影更加生动的真实外表了。她把画像紧紧抱在胸前，她可以从萦绕在她脑海里的纯洁幸福的幻想中召唤出那个栩栩如生的幻影，与她一道漫步在洒满月光的花园里。即使是在正午，金色的阳光洒落在斑驳的树影中，那个幻影也和她一起坐在凉亭里。幻影对她内心的影响力几乎不亚于她亲自听到埃德加·沃恩的誓言，以及她亲口与他交换承诺。因为，虽然她知道这只是幻觉，但这幻影留下的记忆却像一次真实的会面一样清晰。那双令人愉快的双眸永远凝视着她的灵魂，而她的灵魂也在这两泓清泉中畅饮，现实的阴云一出现，她就会焦虑不安。她听到一个美妙的声音在向她低诉柔情，和她自己的心曲一起奏出了音乐般的和弦。哦，幸福而又不幸的女孩！就这样，她创造出了自己所爱的人，赋予了他最令她着迷的所有特质，并随后和这个如空气般虚幻的人一同飞入了那月光如洗的梦幻王国，那里聚居着他梦幻般的同类。西尔维亚的恋人把她从那看起来陌生、沉闷、阴暗的尘世诱骗了出来，引诱她来到了一个国度。在这里，她的心灵倍感安详，徜徉在欢喜中，她以为找到了自己的归宿。许多人在年轻的时候都曾拜访过那梦想的国度，他们在那令人陶醉的小树林中长久地漫步，以至于被从那里驱逐出去以后，无论到了哪里，他们都会觉得是在流浪漂泊。","But now could Sylvia give a brighter semblance of reality to those day-dreams.Clasping the miniature to her heart, she could summon forth, from that haunted cell of pure and blissful fantasies, the life-like shadow, to roam with her in the moonlight garden.Even at noontide it sat with her in the arbor, when the sunshine threw its broken flakes of gold into the clustering shade.The effect upon her mind was hardly less powerful than if she had actually listened to, and reciprocated, the vows of Edgar Vaughan; for, though the illusion never quite deceived her, yet the remembrance was as distinct as of a remembered interview.Those heavenly eyes gazed forever into her soul, which drank at them as at a fountain, and was disquieted if reality threw a momentary cloud between.She heard the melody of a voice breathing sentiments with which her own chimed in like music.O happy, yet hapless girl!Thus to create the being whom she loves, to endow him with all the attributes that were most fascinating to her heart, and then to flit with the airy creature into the realm of fantasy and moonlight, where dwelt his dreamy kindred!For her lover wiled Sylvia away from earth, which seemed strange, and dull, and darksome, and lured her to a country where her spirit roamed in peaceful rapture, deeming that it had found its home.Many, in their youth, have visited that land of dreams, and wandered so long in its enchanted groves, that, when banished thence, they feel like exiles everywhere."
"眉毛浓重的爱德华·汉密尔顿和故事里的恶棍十分相似，他时常会溜进可怜的西尔维亚徘徊的浪漫国度。有时，画像上的容貌被天空映衬得光彩照人，她欣喜而入迷，感觉幸福无比。就在这时，画面会突然变得暗淡，随即变成了爱德华·汉密尔顿的面容。每当出现这种变化时，那个侵入者的脸上总是挂着那种独特的笑容，就是汉密尔顿扫视西尔维亚时的那种笑容。","The dark-browed Edward Hamilton, like the villain of a tale, would often glide through the romance wherein poor Sylvia walked.Sometimes, at the most blissful moment of her ecstasy, when the features of the miniature were pictured brightest in the air, they would suddenly change, and darken, and be transformed into his visage.And always, when such change occurred, the intrusive visage wore that peculiar smile with which Hamilton had glanced at Sylvia."
"夏末的一天，有人告诉西尔维亚·埃瑟里奇，沃恩已经从法国回来了，她能见到他了——这将是她第一次与相爱多年的恋人见面——就在当晚。她不停地、热切地凝视着那幅画像，努力为即将到来的会面做好准备，以免她那颗羞怯的心跳得太厉害，连欢迎的话都说不出来。这些都不用我们详加描述了。暮色越来越深，越来越昏暗，她同格罗夫纳夫人坐在内厅里，只有一盏雪花石膏制的台灯照亮房间；台灯在远处客厅中心的桌子上，散发出柔和的微光。西尔弗从未像现在这样如精灵般曼妙。她一直和想象中的人交融在一起，以至于她自己的秀美动人也似乎是精美梦幻的产物。每当听到房间外咯吱作响的车轮声和人行道上嗒嗒的脚步声，她的心都会为之一颤，身体也随着微微颤抖。她甚至觉得微风携载了她恋人的脚步声，仿佛他是踏着透明的空气走路的。格罗夫纳夫人看到西尔维亚流露出的颤抖的表情，也被深深地打动了。她不安地看着这个焦虑的女孩，正想说些什么，可就在这时，街门打开了，她的话就停在了嘴边。","Before the close of summer, it was told Sylvia Etherege that Vaughan had arrived from France, and that she would meet him—would meet, for the first time, the loved of years—that very evening.We will not tell how often and how earnestly she gazed upon the miniature, thus endeavoring to prepare herself for the approaching interview, lest the throbbing of her timorous heart should stifle the words of welcome.While the twilight grew deeper and duskier, she sat with Mrs. Grosvenor in an inner apartment, lighted only by the softened gleam from an alabaster lamp, which was burning at a distance on the centre-table of the drawing-room.Never before had Sylph Etherege looked so sylph-like.She had communed with a creature of imagination, till her own loveliness seemed but the creation of a delicate and dreamy fancy.Every vibration of her spirit was visible in her frame, as she listened to the rattling of wheels and the tramp upon the pavement, and deemed that even the breeze bore the sound of her lover’s footsteps, as if he trode upon the viewless air.Mrs. Grosvenor, too, while she watched the tremulous flow of Sylvia’s feelings, was deeply moved; she looked uneasily at the agitated girl, and was about to speak, when the opening of the street-door arrested the words upon her lips."
"传来了上楼的脚步声，步伐自信而熟悉，有人走进了会客厅。因为格罗夫纳夫人和西尔维亚坐在内厅的沙发上，所以他们无法辨认造访者是谁。","Footsteps ascended the staircase, with a confident and familiar tread, and some one entered the drawing-room.From the sofa where they sat, in the inner apartment, Mrs. Grosvenor and Sylvia could not discern the visitor."
"“西尔弗！”一个声音叫道，“我最亲爱的西尔弗！你在哪儿，可爱的西尔弗·埃瑟里奇？你的埃德加·沃恩回来了！”","“Sylph!” cried a voice.“Dearest Sylph!Where are you, sweet Sylph Etherege?Here is your Edgar Vaughan!”"
"但是，她并没有回答，也没有起身与她的心上人相见——他用那个甜美而奇异的名字问候她，这个名字只有他知道，而且是那么符合她的性情——西尔维亚抓紧了格罗夫纳夫人的手臂，全身都在她怦怦直跳的心脏带动下颤抖起来。","But instead of answering, or rising to meet her lover,—who had greeted her by the sweet and fanciful name, which, appropriate as it was to her character, was known only to him,—Sylvia grasped Mrs. Grosvenor’s arm, while her whole frame shook with the throbbing of her heart."
"“是谁？”她气喘吁吁地说道，“是谁叫我西尔弗？”","“Who is it?” gasped she.“Who calls me Sylph?”"
"格罗夫纳夫人还没来得及回答，那个陌生人就举着灯走进了房间。他走近了沙发，展现在西尔维亚面前的是爱德华·汉密尔顿的面容，他脸上闪着那种邪恶的笑容，这使他的面貌显得颇有个性。","Before Mrs. Grosvenor could reply, the stranger entered the room, bearing the lamp in his hand.Approaching the sofa, he displayed to Sylvia the features of Edward Hamilton, illuminated by that evil smile, from which his face derived so marked an individuality."
"“画像跟我本人简直像极了，不是吗？”他问道。","“Is not the miniature an admirable likeness?” inquired he."
"西尔维亚全身发抖，可是却没有力量把她那苍白的面容从他的凝视中挪开。她一直握在手里的画像掉在了地板上，汉密尔顿，或者说是沃恩，把这个象牙制的冒牌货踩成了碎片。","Sylvia shuddered, but had not power to turn away her white face from his gaze.The miniature, which she had been holding in her hand, fell down upon the floor, where Hamilton, or Vaughan, set his foot upon it, and crushed the ivory counterfeit to fragments."
"“瞧，我可爱的西尔弗，”他大声说道，“创造出你那梦幻恋人的人就是我，而我现在把他彻底毁灭了！你的梦被无情地毁灭了。醒醒吧，西尔弗·埃瑟里奇，回到现实吧！我才是唯一的埃德加·沃恩！”","“There, my sweet Sylph,” he exclaimed.“It was I that created your phantom-lover, and now I annihilate him!Your dream is rudely broken.Awake, Sylph Etherege, awake to truth!I am the only Edgar Vaughan!”"
"“埃德加·沃恩，我们做得太过分了，”格罗夫纳夫人说着把西尔维亚揽到了怀里。沃恩受伤的虚荣心使他想到了这个怪异的报复行动，并且得到了这位夫人的赞同，因为她希望能够以此消除西尔维亚的浪漫念头，甘心接受生活的真相和现实。“看看这个可怜的孩子！”她接着说，“我反对你这样做！这样做的后果让我担心。”","“We have gone too far, Edgar Vaughan,” said Mrs. Grosvenor, catching Sylvia in her arms.The revengeful freak, which Vaughan’s wounded vanity had suggested, had been countenanced by this lady, in the hope of curing Sylvia of her romantic notions, and reconciling her to the truths and realities of life.“Look at the poor child!” she continued.“I protest! I tremble for the consequences!”"
"“的确，夫人！”沃恩轻蔑地答道，同时用台灯照亮了西尔维亚紧闭的双眼和大理石般光滑的脸庞。“好了，反正我对此问心无愧。我只不过窥视了这位娇弱姑娘的内心，然后仅凭我在她心里发现的幻想虚构出了一个男人的模样——而那个令人迷惑的幻影把她诱骗到梦幻的国度后，便在那儿消失了！这并不是什么新鲜的故事。许多可爱的少女都有过和西尔弗·埃瑟里奇一样的遭遇！”","“Indeed, madam!” replied Vaughan, sneeringly, as he threw the light of the lamp on Sylvia’s closed eyes and marble features.“Well, my conscience is clear.I did but look into this delicate creature’s heart; and with the pure fantasies that I found there, I made what seemed a man,—and the delusive shadow has wiled her away to Shadow-land, and vanished there!It is no new tale.Many a sweet maid has shared the lot of poor Sylph Etherege!”"
"“现在，埃德加·沃恩，”格罗夫纳夫人说道，“现在你得真诚地努力赢回她的爱，把她从你虚构出来的那个幻影手中夺回来。这时，西尔维亚的心脏又开始微弱地跳动。如果你成功了，她一辈子都会因为我们给她的这个教训而受益。”","“And now, Edgar Vaughan,” said Mrs. Grosvenor, as Sylvia’s heart began faintly to throb again, “now try, in good earnest, to win back her love from the phantom which you conjured up.If you succeed, she will be the better, her whole life long, for the lesson we have given her.”"
"至于这个教训的效果能否与格罗夫纳夫人期望的一致，我们可以从故事的结尾获悉。这个故事已经在上流社会流传开了：埃德加·沃恩已经从法国归来了，化名为爱德华·汉密尔顿，赢得了和他从小订下婚约的一位美丽姑娘的真心。他们不久就要举行婚礼了。在那期盼已久的美满之日的前一天晚上，埃德加·沃恩来到格罗夫纳夫人的会客厅，找到了夫人和西尔弗·埃瑟里奇。","Whether the result of the lesson corresponded with Mrs. Grosvenor’s hopes, may be gathered from the closing scene of our story.It had been made known to the fashionable world that Edgar Vaughan had returned from France, and, under the assumed name of Edward Hamilton, had won the affections of the lovely girl to whom he had been affianced in his boyhood.The nuptials were to take place at an early date.One evening, before the day of anticipated bliss arrived, Edgar Vaughan entered Mrs. Grosvenor’s drawing-room, where he found that lady and Sylph Etherege."
"“要不是西尔维亚没有一丝抱怨，”格罗夫纳夫人说道，“我还担心镇上的空气不适宜她的体质呢。其实，她一直都是个娇弱的姑娘，可现在她脆弱得简直像一块轻纱。你看看她！你能想象得出还有比她更虚弱的人吗？”","“Only that Sylvia makes no complaint,” remarked Mrs. Grosvenor, “I should apprehend that the town air is ill-suited to her constitution.She was always, indeed, a delicate creature; but now she is a mere gossamer.Do but look at her!Did you ever imagine anything so fragile?”"
"沃恩早已开始专心地观察他的爱人。她坐在房间的一个阴暗的角落里，沐浴着朦胧的月光，梦幻般的双眸坚定地凝视着他的眼睛。一根大树枝在窗前来回摇摆着，时而将她笼罩在昏暗的阴影中，她似乎就要消失在其中了。","Vaughan was already attentively observing his mistress, who sat in a shadowy and moonlighted recess of the room, with her dreamy eyes fixed steadfastly upon his own.The bough of a tree was waving before the window, and sometimes enveloped her in the gloom of its shadow, into which she seemed to vanish."
"“是的，”他对格罗夫纳夫人说，“我几乎不能把她视为来自尘世的、世俗的人。难怪我叫她西尔弗！我觉得，她会渐渐消失在从窗外洒在她身上的月光里。或者，如果是在野外，她或许会像一缕薄雾，随风飘散！”","“Yes,” he said, to Mrs. Grosvenor.“I can scarcely deem her of the earth, earthy.No wonder that I call her Sylph!Methinks she will fade into the moonlight, which falls upon her through the window.Or, in the open air, she might flit away upon the breeze, like a wreath of mist!”"
"可西尔维亚的双眸变得更加明亮了。她带着缥缈的胜利的姿态，向埃德加挥了挥手。","Sylvia’s eyes grew yet brighter.She waved her hand to Edgar Vaughan, with a gesture of ethereal triumph."
"“再见了！”她说道，“我不会消逝在月光中，也不会随风飘散。但你不能把我留在这里！”","“Farewell!” she said.“I will neither fade into the moonlight, nor flit away upon the breeze.Yet you cannot keep me here!”"
"西尔维亚的表情和语气让格罗夫纳夫人大为震惊，她明白了她话中的可怕涵义。但是，当她正要冲向西尔弗时，沃恩拦住了她。","There was something in Sylvia’s look and tones that startled Mrs. Grosvenor with a terrible apprehension.But, as she was rushing towards the girl, Vaughan held her back."
"“站住！”他喊道，脸上带着嘲笑和痛苦的怪笑，“我们可爱的西尔弗是要去天堂寻找画像中的那个人吗？”","“Stay!” cried he, with a strange smile of mockery and anguish.“Can our sweet Sylph be going to heaven, to seek the original of the miniature?”"
