"The Water-Lily","睡莲花"
"by Andrew Lang","作者：安德鲁·朗格"
"Once upon a time, in a large forest, there lived an old woman and three maidens.","从前，在一片大森林里住着一位老妇人和三个少女。"
"They were all three beautiful, but the youngest was the fairest.","这三个少女都很漂亮，但最漂亮的要数最小的那个。"
"Their hut was quite hidden by trees, and none saw their beauty but the sun by day, and the moon by night, and the eyes of the stars.","她们的小屋被树丛藏得相当隐蔽，没有人看见过她们的美貌，除了白天的太阳、晚上的月亮以及星星的眼睛。"
"The old woman kept the girls hard at work, from morning till night, spinning gold flax into yarn, and when one distaff was empty another was given them, so they had no rest.","老妇人让她们从早到晚不停地努力工作，把金亚麻线纺成纱。当一个卷线杯空了，又会有另一个卷线杯送上来，所以她们没有休息的时候。"
"The thread had to be fine and even, and when done was locked up in a secret chamber by the old woman, who twice or thrice every summer went a journey.","她们纺的线必须精细、均匀，并且纺好的线会被老妇人锁在一间秘密的房子里，而老妇人则每年夏天去旅行两三次。"
"Before she went she gave out work for each day of her absence, and always returned in the night, so that the girls never saw what she brought back with her, neither would she tell them whence the gold flax came, nor what it was to be used for.","她走前，会把不在时每天的工作分配好，并且总是晚上回来，所以姑娘们从未见过她带回的是什么，而她也不会告诉她们金亚麻的来源以及它们的用途。"
"Now, when the time came round for the old woman to set out on one of these journeys, she gave each maiden work for six days, with the usual warning: “Children, don’t let your eyes wander, and on no account speak to a man, for, if you do, your thread will lose its brightness, and misfortunes of all kinds will follow.”","现在，老妇人出门旅行的时间又一次如期而至，她交给每位少女六天的任务，并像往常一样警告她们：“孩子们，不要让你们的眼睛四处张望，也绝不能和男子说话，因为，如果这样做的话，你们纺的线会失去光泽，各种不幸也会随之而至。”"
"They laughed at this oft-repeated caution, saying to each other: “How can our gold thread lose its brightness, and have we any chance of speaking to a man?”","她们对这经常重复的警告付之一笑，并对彼此说：“我们的金线又怎么能失去光泽呢，我们又怎能有任何机会和男子说话呢？”"
"On the third day after the old woman’s departure a young prince, hunting in the forest, got separated from his companions, and completely lost.","老妇人离开后的第三天，一位在森林里打猎的年轻王子和他的同伴们走散了，完全迷了路。"
"Weary of seeking his way, he flung himself down under a tree, leaving his horse to browse at will, and fell asleep.","他找路找得筋疲力尽，便倒在一棵树下，任由他的马儿随意吃草，自己睡着了。"
"The sun had set when he awoke and began once more to try and find his way out of the forest.","他醒来时太阳已下山，便开始再次试着找寻走出森林的路。"
"At last he perceived a narrow foot-path, which he eagerly followed and found that it led him to a small hut.","最后，他找到一条很窄的小径，便迫不及待地顺着小径走，发现自己来到了一座小屋面前。"
"The maidens, who were sitting at the door of their hut for coolness, saw him approaching, and the two elder were much alarmed, for they remembered the old woman’s warning; but the youngest said: “Never before have I seen anyone like him; let me have one look.”","少女们正坐在小屋门口乘凉。看到他走近，两位年长的少女都很惊恐，因为她们记得老妇人的警告；但是，最小的少女却说：“我以前从未见过像他这样的人，让我看一眼吧。”"
"They entreated her to come in, but, seeing that she would not, left her, and the Prince, coming up, courteously greeted the maiden, and told her he had lost his way in the forest and was both hungry and weary.","她们恳求她进屋，看到她不肯，便随她去了。王子走过来，礼貌地向少女问好，并告诉她自己在森林里迷了路，又饿又累。"
"She set food before him, and was so delighted with his conversation that she forgot the old woman’s caution, and lingered for hours.","她在他面前摆了些食物，和他愉悦地交谈着，以至于忘记了老妇人的警告，谈了好几个小时。"
"In the meantime the Prince’s companions sought him far and wide, but to no purpose, so they sent two messengers to tell the sad news to the King, who immediately ordered a regiment of cavalry and one of infantry to go and look for him.","而此时，王子的同伴们正到处找他，但是毫无结果。于是，他们便派两名信使把这个悲伤的消息告诉了国王。国王立刻派了一支骑兵团和一支步兵团去寻找王子。"
"After three days’ search, they found the hut.","搜寻三天后，他们发现了这间小屋。"
"The Prince was still sitting by the door and had been so happy in the maiden’s company that the time had seemed like a single hour.","王子依然坐在门前，他在少女的陪伴下如此开心，以至于时间似乎只过了一个小时。"
"Before leaving he promised to return and fetch her to his father’s court, where he would make her his bride.","在走之前，他承诺会回来接她到他父亲的王宫，并在那里娶她为妻。"
"When he had gone, she sat down to her wheel to make up for lost time, but was dismayed to find that her thread had lost all its brightness.","他走后，她在纺轮前坐了下来以弥补她落下的时间，但却沮丧地发现她纺的线失去了所有的光泽。"
"Her heart beat fast and she wept bitterly, for she remembered the old woman’s warning and knew not what misfortune might now befall her.","她开始心跳加快，然后悲痛地哭了起来，因为她记起了老妇人的警告，不知道如今会有什么不幸可能降临在她身上。"
"The old woman returned in the night and knew by the tarnished thread what had happened in her absence.","老妇人晚上回来了，看到暗淡无光的纺线，便明白了在她离开期间发生了什么事情。"
"She was furiously angry and told the maiden that she had brought down misery both on herself and on the Prince.","她大发雷霆，告诉少女她不仅给自己，也给王子带来了不幸。"
"The maiden could not rest for thinking of this.","想到这点，少女无法平静。"
"At last she could bear it no longer, and resolved to seek help from the Prince.","最后，她再也忍不住了，决定向王子寻求帮助。"
"As a child she had learned to understand the speech of birds, and this was now of great use to her, for, seeing a raven pluming itself on a pine bough, she cried softly to it: “Dear bird, cleverest of all birds, as well as swiftest on wing, wilt thou help me?”","当她还是个孩子的时候，就已经学会了听鸟儿说话，而现在正好派上用场。因为，她看到一只乌鸦正在一棵松树枝上梳理自己的羽毛，便轻声地向它喊道：“亲爱的鸟儿，所有鸟类中最聪明、飞得最快的鸟儿，你愿意帮助我吗？”"
"“How can I help thee?” asked the raven.","“我怎样才能帮你呢？”乌鸦问道。"
"She answered: “Fly away, until thou comest to a splendid town, where stands a king’s palace; seek out the king’s son and tell him that a great misfortune has befallen me.”","她答道：“飞离这里，飞到一座繁华的城市，那里坐落着一位国王的宫殿，你找到国王的儿子并告诉他一个巨大的不幸已降临到我身上。”"
"Then she told the raven how her thread had lost its brightness, how terribly angry the old woman was, and how she feared some great disaster.","于是她告诉乌鸦，她纺的线如何失去了光泽，老妇人如何大发雷霆，她又如何害怕那非常巨大的不幸。"
"The raven promised faithfully to do her bidding, and, spreading its wings, flew away.","乌鸦忠诚地许诺她会按照她的吩咐去做，然后展开翅膀飞走了。"
"The maiden now went home and worked hard all day at winding up the yarn her elder sisters had spun, for the old woman would let her spin no longer.","少女马上回到家中，一整天都在努力卷着姐姐们纺好的纱线，因为老妇人不再让她纺纱了。"
"Toward evening she heard the raven’s “craa, craa,” from the pine tree and eagerly hastened thither to hear the answer.","将近傍晚时，她听到了松树上传来乌鸦“呱呱”的叫声，便迫不及待地赶去那里听回复。"
"By great good fortune the raven had found a wind wizard’s son in the palace garden, who understood the speech of birds, and to him he had entrusted the message.","非常幸运的是，乌鸦在王宫的花园里找到了风巫的儿子，他懂得鸟类的语言，于是乌鸦将消息托付给了他。"
"When the Prince heard it, he was very sorrowful, and took counsel with his friends how to free the maiden.","王子听到消息后，非常伤心，便和他的朋友们一起商议如何解救少女。"
"Then he said to the wind wizard’s son: “Beg the raven to fly quickly back to the maiden and tell her to be ready on the ninth night, for then will I come and fetch her away.”","然后他对风巫的儿子说：“恳求乌鸦赶快飞回少女那里，告诉她在第九天的夜里准备好，因为那时，我将到那儿接她离开。”"
"The wind wizard’s son did this, and the raven flew so swiftly that it reached the hut that same evening.","风巫的儿子把话传给了乌鸦，乌鸦迅速起飞，在当天晚上就回到了小屋。"
"The maiden thanked the bird heartily and went home, telling no one what she had heard.","少女衷心感谢了乌鸦，回了家，没有将她听到的告诉任何人。"
"As the ninth night drew near she became very unhappy, for she feared lest some terrible mischance should arise and ruin all.","随着第九天晚上临近，她变得很不开心，因为她担心发生什么可怕的不幸，毁了所有安排。"
"On this night she crept quietly out of the house and waited trembling at some little distance from the hut.","这天晚上，她悄悄地爬出了小屋，在离小屋不远的地方颤抖地等待着。"
"Presently she heard the muffled tramp of horses, and soon the armed troop appeared, led by the Prince, who had prudently marked all the trees beforehand, in order to know the way.","一会儿，她听到了低沉的马蹄声，很快，王子带领着军队出现了——他事先已谨慎地标记了所有的树木以便识路。"
"When he saw the maiden he sprang from his horse, lifted her into the saddle, and then, mounting behind, rode homeward.","当他看到少女时，从马上跳下来，将她抱到马鞍上，然后，上马坐在她身后，向家的方向骑去。"
"The moon shone so brightly that they had no difficulty in seeing the marked trees.","月光照耀得如此明亮，他们很容易看到带有标记的树木。"
"By and by the coming of dawn loosened the tongues of all the birds, and, had the Prince only known what they were saying, or the maiden been listening, they might have been spared much sorrow, but they were thinking only of each other, and when they came out of the forest the sun was high in the heavens.","黎明渐渐到来，鸟儿们都放开了歌喉。要是王子知道它们在说什么，或者少女听一听的话，他们或许可以免遭许多痛苦，但是他们当时想的只有彼此。当他们骑出森林时，太阳已经高高挂在天空上了。"
"Next morning, when the youngest girl did not come to her work, the old woman asked where she was.","次日清晨，最小的少女没有来工作，老妇人便问她去了哪里。"
"The sisters pretended not to know, but the old woman easily guessed what had happened, and, as she was in reality a wicked witch, determined to punish the fugitives.","姐姐们假装不知道，但是老妇人很容易便猜到了发生了什么事。事实上，她是一个邪恶的巫婆，她决定惩罚这对逃逸者。"
"Accordingly, she collected nine different kinds of enchanters’ nightshade, added some salt, which she first bewitched, and, doing all up in a cloth into the shape of a fluffy ball, sent it after them on the wings of the wind, saying:","于是，她采集了九种不同的巫师的龙葵，并加了一些盐，她先施了法，接着把它们包到一块布里，包成一个绒毛状的小球，然后让它乘着风的翅膀追赶他们，她说：“"
"“Whirlwind!—mother of the wind!","“旋风啊！——风之母！"
"Lend thy aid ‘gainst her who sinned!","借着您的帮助惩罚那个有罪的她吧！"
"Carry with thee this magic ball.","载着这个魔球，"
"Cast her from his arms for ever,","叫她永远回不到他的怀抱，"
"Bury her in the rippling river.”","叫她葬身在泛起涟漪的河中。”"
"At midday the Prince and his men came to a deep river, spanned by so narrow a bridge that only one rider could cross at a time.","中午，王子和他的侍卫们来到一条深河前，河上架着一座十分窄的桥，一次只能一个人通过。"
"The horse on which the Prince and the maiden were riding had just reached the middle when the magic ball flew by.","王子和少女正骑的马刚到桥中间，那个魔球便飞了过来。"
"The horse in its fright suddenly reared, and before anyone could stop it flung the maiden into the swift current below.","马儿受了惊，突然暴跳起来，大家还没来得及阻止，就把少女抛到了下面的急流中。"
"The Prince tried to jump in after her, but his men held him back, and in spite of his struggles led him home, where for six weeks he shut himself up in a secret chamber, and would neither eat nor drink, so great was his grief.","王子试图随她一起跳下，但是他的侍卫们把他拉了回来，不顾他挣扎，把他拉回了加。他连续六周把自己关在一个秘密的房间里，不吃也不喝，十分悲痛。"
"At last he became so ill his life was despaired of, and in great alarm the King caused all the wizards of his country to be summoned.","最后，他病得很严重，生命垂危了。国王十分惊恐，将全国所有的巫师都召集过来。"
"But none could cure him.","但是没有人能治好他。"
"At last the wind wizard’s son said to the King: “Send for the old wizard from Finland he knows more than all the wizards of your kingdom put together.”","最后，风巫的儿子告诉国王：“派人去请芬兰的老巫师吧，他知道的要比您国家所有的巫师加在一起的都要多。”"
"A messenger was at once sent to Finland, and a week later the old wizard himself arrived on the wings of the wind.","一位信使立即被派往芬兰，一周后，老巫师亲自乘着风的翅膀来到。"
"“Honored King,” said the wizard, “the wind has blown this illness upon your son, and a magic ball has snatched away his beloved.","“尊敬的国王，”巫师道，“风儿把这病吹给了您儿子，一个魔球夺走了他最爱的人。"
"This it is which makes him grieve so constantly.","就是这个原因使他一直悲痛。"
"Let the wind blow upon him that it may blow away his sorrow.”","让风吹吹他，或许可以吹走他的痛苦。”"
"Then the King made his son go out into the wind, and he gradually recovered and told his father all.","于是国王让儿子出去到风里，王子逐渐地恢复过来，并把所有的事情告诉给了父亲。"
"“Forget the maiden,” said the King, “and take another bride”; but the Prince said he could never love another.","“忘记那个姑娘吧，”国王道，“娶其他姑娘做新娘吧。”但是，王子说他不会再爱上其他人了。"
"A year afterward he came suddenly upon the bridge where his beloved met her death.","一年后，他意外地来到他最爱的姑娘死去的那座桥上。"
"As he recalled the misfortune he wept bitterly, and would have given all he possessed to have her once more alive.","当他回忆起那些不幸时，开始痛哭起来，愿意付出他拥有的一切以使她再活过来。"
"In the midst of his grief he thought he heard a voice singing, and looked round, but could see no one.","正当他悲痛之时，他感觉自己听到了一个声音在唱歌，便四处察看，却没看到人。"
"Then he heard the voice again, and it said:","接着他又一次听到了那个声音，它说："
"“Alas! bewitched and all forsaken, ’Tis I must lie for ever here!","“唉！被施魔法并被所有人抛弃，这就是我必须永远躺在这里的原因！"
"My beloved no thought has taken To free his bride, that was so dear.”","我的爱人没有想过解救他的新娘，这令人如此悲伤。”"
"He was greatly astonished, sprang from his horse, and looked everywhere to see if no one were hidden under the bridge; but no one was there.","他非常惊奇，跳下马，四处察看是否有人被藏在桥下，但那里空无一人。"
"Then he noticed a yellow water-lily floating on the surface of the water, half hidden by its broad leaves; but flowers do not sing, and in great surprise he waited, hoping to hear more.","接着他注意到水面上漂浮着一朵黄色的睡莲花，花朵被宽大的叶子半掩着；但是花儿没有唱歌，他万分惊异地等待着，希望能再次听到歌声。"
"Then again the voice sang:","然后那声音又唱了起来："
"“Alas! bewitched and all forsaken,","“唉！被施魔法并被所有人抛弃，"
"’Tis I must lie for ever here!","这就是我为什么必须永远躺在这里的原因！"
"My beloved no thought has taken","我的爱人没有想过"
"To free his bride, that was so dear.”","解救他的新娘，这令人如此悲伤。”"
"The Prince suddenly remembered the gold-spinners, and said to himself: “If I ride thither, who knows but that they could explain this to me?”","王子突然想起了纺金纱的少女们，自言自语道：“如果我骑马到那里，谁知道她们不会把这些解释给我呢？”"
"He at once rode to the hut, and found the two maidens at the fountain.","他立刻骑马向小屋奔去，在喷泉那儿找到了两位少女。"
"He told them what had befallen their sister the year before, and how he had twice heard a strange song, but yet could see no singer.","他告诉她们一年前降临在她们的妹妹身上的不幸，他又如何两次听到奇怪的歌唱，但是却看不到歌唱者。"
"They said that the yellow water-lily could be none other than their sister, who was not dead, but transformed by the magic ball.","她们说那黄色的睡莲花不是别人，正是她们的妹妹，她没有死，但是却被魔球改变了模样。"
"Before he went to bed, the eldest made a cake of magic herbs, which she gave him to eat.","在他睡前，年纪最大的少女用有魔力的香草做了一个蛋糕给他吃。"
"In the night he dreamed that he was living in the forest and could understand all that the birds said to each other.","晚上，他梦到自己住在森林里，并能听懂鸟类彼此间的所有话语。"
"Next morning he told this to the maidens, and they said that the charmed cake had caused it, and advised him to listen well to the birds, and see what they could tell him, and when he had recovered his bride they begged him to return and deliver them from their wretched bondage.","第二天早晨，他将这告诉了少女们。她们说是那块有魔力的蛋糕所致，并建议他好好听鸟儿说的话，看看它们能告诉他什么。她们恳求他找回新娘后，回来将她们从痛苦的奴役中解救出来。"
"Having promised this, he joyfully returned home, and as he was riding through the forest he could perfectly understand all that the birds said.","王子答应这个要求后，开心地回家了。骑马经过森林时，他能完全听懂鸟儿所说的话了。"
"He heard a thrush say to a magpie: “How stupid men are! they cannot understand the simplest thing.","他听到一只画眉对一只喜鹊说：“人类多么愚蠢啊！他们连最简单的事情都理解不了。"
"It is now quite a year since the maiden was transformed into a water-lily, and, though she sings so sadly that anyone going over the bridge must hear her, yet no one comes to her aid.","如今，那位少女被变成睡莲花都一年了，尽管她唱得如此伤悲，每个过桥的人一定都听到了她的歌声，但是没有人来帮助她。"
"Her former bridegroom rode over it a few days ago and heard her singing, but was no wiser than the rest.”","她以前的新郎几天前骑马过桥时听到她在唱歌，但是并不比其他人聪明多少。”"
"“And he is to blame for all her misfortunes,” added the magpie.","“他应为她所有的不幸负责，”喜鹊又说道，"
"“If he heeds only the words of men she will remain a flower for ever.","“如果他只注意人类的话语，她将永远做一朵花。"
"She were soon delivered were the matter only laid before the old wizard of Finland.”","只有把这件事情放到芬兰的老巫师面前，她才会很快被解救。”"
"After hearing this, the Prince wondered how he could get a message conveyed to Finland.","听到这后，王子想知道他怎样才能将信息传到芬兰。"
"He heard one swallow say to another: “Come, let us fly to Finland; we can build better nests there.”","他听到一只燕子对另一只说：“来，让我们一起飞到芬兰；在那里，我们可以建一个好一点儿的巢。”"
"“Stop, kind friends!” cried the Prince.","“等一下，好心的朋友们！”王子喊道，"
"“Will you do something for me?”","“你们愿意为我做一些事情么？”"
"The birds consented, and he said: “Take a thousand greetings from me to the wizard of Finland, and ask him how I may restore a maiden transformed into a flower to her own form.”","鸟儿们同意了，他说：“将我的一千个问候带给芬兰的巫师，然后问他我怎样才可以使一位被变成花儿的姑娘恢复到她原来的模样。”"
"The swallows flew away, and the Prince rode on to the bridge.","燕子飞走了，王子骑马来到桥上。"
"There he waited, hoping to hear the song.","在那里，他等待着，希望能听到歌声。"
"But he heard nothing but the rushing of the water and the moaning of the wind, and, disappointed, rode home.","但是，除了河水的奔腾声和风儿的低鸣声，他什么也没听到。他很失望，骑马回家了。"
"Shortly after, he was sitting in the garden, thinking that the swallows must have forgotten his message, when he saw an eagle flying above him.","不久后，他坐在花园里，想着燕子们一定忘记了他让带的讯息，正在这时，他看到一只鹰在他上方飞翔。"
"The bird gradually descended until it perched on a tree close to the Prince and said: “The wizard of Finland greets thee and bids me say that thou mayest free the maiden thus: Go to the river and smear thyself all over with mud; then say: ‘From a man into a crab,’ and thou wilt become a crab.","那只鹰渐渐地飞下，直到落在了王子附近的一棵树上，它说：“芬兰的巫师向你问好，并嘱咐我告诉你可以这样解救少女：去河边将你全身涂抹上污泥，然后说：‘从人变成螃蟹。’然后你将变成一只螃蟹。"
"Plunge boldly into the water, swim as close as thou canst to the water-lily’s roots, and loosen them from the mud and reeds.","大胆地跳入水中，尽可能地游近那棵睡莲的根，然后把它从污泥和芦苇中松开。"
"This done, fasten thy claws into the roots and rise with them to the surface.","做完这些后，将蟹爪扣紧并嵌入根部，然后连同根部一起举到水面上。"
"Let the water flow all over the flower, and drift with the current until thou comest to a mountain ash tree on the left bank.","让水流过整株花，然后你随溪流漂流直到来到左岸边的一棵花楸树旁。"
"There is near it a large stone.","花楸树附近有块大石头。"
"Stop there and say: ‘From a crab into a man, from a water-lily into a maiden,’ and ye both will be restored to your own forms.”","你停在那里说：‘从螃蟹变回人，从睡莲花变回少女。’这样，你们就都会恢复到原来的样子了。”"
"Full of doubt and fear, the Prince let some time pass before he was bold enough to attempt to rescue the maiden.","王子充满了怀疑和恐惧，任凭时间流逝也未足够勇敢去尝试营救少女。"
"Then a crow said to him: “Why dost thou hesitate?","接着一只乌鸦对他说：“你为什么犹豫呢？"
"The old wizard has not told thee wrong, neither have the birds deceived thee; hasten and dry the maiden’s tears.”","老巫师告诉你的没错，鸟儿们也没有欺骗你，快去擦干那个少女的泪水吧。”"
"“Nothing worse than death can befall me,” thought the Prince, “and death is better than endless sorrow.”","“没有什么比死亡更糟的了，”王子心想，“但死亡比无尽的伤痛要好。”"
"So he mounted his horse and went to the bridge.","于是他骑上了马向桥奔去。"
"Again he heard the water-lily’s lament, and, hesitating no longer, smeared himself all over with mud, and, saying: “From a man into a crab,” plunged into the river.","他再次听到了睡莲花的哀叹。他不再犹豫，用污泥涂抹了全身，而后说：“从人变成螃蟹。”然后，跳进了河里。"
"For one moment the water hissed in his ears, and then all was silent.","片刻间，水在他耳朵里咝咝作响，而后，一切变得十分安静。"
"He swam up to the plant and began to loosen its roots, but so firmly were they fixed in the mud and reeds that this took him a long time.","他游到那株植物旁，开始松它的根，但是根部在污泥和芦苇里被牢牢固定着，这花了他很长时间。"
"He then grasped them and rose to the surface, letting the water flow over the flower.","接着他抓着根部并将它举向水面，让流水从花上流过。"
"The current carried them down the stream, but nowhere could he see the mountain ash.","溪流带着他们漂向下游，但是到处都没找到那棵花揪树。"
"At last he saw it, and close by the large stone.","最后他终于看到了它，附近有一块大石头。"
"Here he stopped and said: “From a crab into a man, from a water-lily into a maiden,” and to his delight found himself once more a prince, and the maiden was by his side.","他在那里停了下来，说：“从螃蟹变回人，从睡莲花变回少女。”他高兴地发现自己变回了王子，而那位少女正在他身旁。"
"She was ten times more beautiful than before, and wore a magnificent pale yellow robe, sparkling with jewels.","她比以前要漂亮十倍，穿着一件华丽的淡黄色长袍，闪烁着宝石的光芒。"
"She thanked him for having freed her from the cruel witch’s power, and willingly consented to marry him.","她感谢王子将她从残忍的巫婆的巫术中解救出来，也十分乐意嫁给他。"
"But when they came to the bridge where he had left his horse it was nowhere to be seen, for, though the Prince thought he had been a crab only a few hours, he had in reality been under the water for more than ten days.","但是当他们来到桥上，却没看到王子留在那里的马儿，因为，尽管王子以为自己只做了几个小时的螃蟹，事实上，他已在水下十多天了。"
"While they were wondering how they should reach his father’s court, they saw a splendid coach driven by six gaily caparisoned horses coming along the bank.","正当他们想知道要如何才能到他父亲的王宫时，他们看到一架由六匹打扮华丽的马儿拉着的富丽堂皇的马车顺着河岸走来。"
"In this they drove to the palace.","他们驾着马车回到了王宫。"
"The King and Queen were at church, weeping for their son, whom they had long mourned for dead.","国王和王后正在教堂里为他们的儿子哭泣，他们已经为儿子死去哀痛了许久。"
"Great was their delight and astonishment when the Prince entered, leading the beautiful maiden by the hand.","当王子牵着那位美丽的少女的手进来时，他们真是又惊又喜。"
"The wedding was at once celebrated and there was feasting and merry-making throughout the kingdom for six weeks.","他们立刻就举行了婚礼，整个王国六个星期都在举行盛大的宴会和欢庆活动。"
"Some time afterward the Prince and his bride were sitting in the garden, when a crow said to them: “Ungrateful creatures!","不久后的一天，王子和他的新娘正坐在花园里，这时，一只乌鸦对他们说：“不知感激的家伙！"
"Have you forgotten the two poor maidens who helped you in your distress?","你们难道忘记了在你们危难时帮助过你们的两位可怜的少女吗？"
"Must they spin gold flax for ever?","难道她们要永远纺金亚麻线吗？"
"Have no pity on the old witch.","不要可怜那个老巫婆。"
"The three maidens are princesses, whom she stole away when they were children together, with all the silver utensils, which she turned into gold flax.","这三位少女是公主，在她们都是婴儿的时候，连同那些被她转变成金亚麻线的银器，被老巫婆偷走。"
"Poison were her fittest punishment.”","毒药是对她最好的惩罚。”"
"The Prince was ashamed of having forgotten his promise and set out at once, and by great good fortune reached the hut when the old woman was away.","王子对于自己忘记了的承诺感到十分羞愧，便立刻启程了。十分幸运的是，在他抵达小屋时，老妇人不在。"
"The maidens had dreamed that he was coming, and were ready to go with him, but first they made a cake in which they put poison, and left it on a table where the old woman was likely to see it when she returned.","少女们已料到他要来，准备好了和他一起离开。不过，她们先做了一个蛋糕，并在里面放了毒药，然后将它留在老妇人一回来就可能看到的桌子上。"
"She did see it, and thought it looked so tempting that she greedily ate it up and at once died.","她的确看见了，觉得它如此诱人，便贪婪地吃了个精光，她立刻便死去了。"
"In the secret chamber were found fifty wagon-loads of gold flax, and as much more was discovered buried.","在一个秘密的小屋里，他们发现了五十车金亚麻线，还发现了更多埋在地下的金亚麻线。"
"The hut was razed to the ground, and the Prince and his bride and her two sisters lived happily ever after.","小屋被夷为平地，王子和他的新娘以及新娘的两个姐姐从此过上了幸福的生活。"
