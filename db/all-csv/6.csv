"第一章","I "
"在轮船苏法拉号改变航线驶向陆地很久以后，低洼而泥泞的海岸在一片闪闪发光的海水后面，看上去依然肮脏不堪，漆黑一团。太阳光好像是猛烈地坠落到平静的海上的——似乎在异常坚硬的海面上摔得粉碎，变成闪光的灰尘，变成耀眼的光雾，闪烁不停，让人眼前一片黑暗，而且精神疲累。","For a long time after the course of the steamer @Sofala@ had been altered for the land, the low swampy coast had retained its appearance of a mere smudge of darkness beyond a belt of glitter.The sunrays seemed to fall violently upon the calm sea—seemed to shatter themselves upon an adamantine surface into sparkling dust, into a dazzling vapor of light that blinded the eye and wearied the brain with its unsteady brightness."
"惠利船长并不望向阳光。他坐在一张藤扶手椅上，几乎要把那个宽大的椅子占满了。当他的水手长走近藤椅，低声告诉他航线需要改变的时候，他便立刻起身，站在原地不动，脸朝前，此刻他那艘船的船头已经旋转了四分之一圈。他没有说一句话，连吩咐掌稳舵的话也没有说。是那个水手长，一个年老但机灵的皮肤黝黑的小个子马来人，低声地向舵手发布了命令。而后惠利船长又慢腾腾地坐回驾驶台上那张扶手椅，眼睛盯着他两脚之间的甲板看。","Captain Whalley did not look at it.When his Serang, approaching the roomy cane arm-chair which he filled capably, had informed him in a low voice that the course was to be altered, he had risen at once and had remained on his feet, face forward, while the head of his ship swung through a quarter of a circle.He had not uttered a single word, not even the word to steady the helm.It was the Serang, an elderly, alert, little Malay, with a very dark skin, who murmured the order to the helmsman.And then slowly Captain Whalley sat down again in the arm-chair on the bridge and fixed his eyes on the deck between his feet."
"在这条航线上，他不抱看到任何新东西的希望。过去三年来，他一直在这一带海岸航行。从低角到马兰丹，有五十英里的距离，顺水的话，他那艘老船需要走六个小时，逆水则需要走七个小时。然后，轮船直接驶向陆地，片刻三棵棕榈树便会在天际出现，又高又细，凌乱的树冠凑在一起，仿佛在悄悄评论黑压压的红树林似的。苏法拉号将会驶向昏暗而狭长的海岸，在一定的时间转弯抹角地靠近海岸，此时海岸就会出现几个整齐的、发亮的裂口——充满了河水的港湾。接着，苏法拉号就会在一道四分之三是水、四分之一是黑泥的棕色河流中，溯流而上，不停地行驶在四分之三是黑泥、四分之一是淡盐水的低洼的两岸中间。在过去七年或是更长的时间里，这艘船每个月都要这样航行一回。这是很久以前了，那时他还不知道有这么一艘船，更没想到他会和这艘船，还有这艘船不变的航线发生什么关系。这艘老船应该比船上的人更熟悉这条航线，船上的人并不是一成不变地待在这里；它也应该比那个忠诚的水手长更熟悉，那是惠利从他上一艘船上带来，代替他这个船长来照看这艘船的；它甚至应该比他自己更熟悉，因为他只在这条船上当了三年的船长。它总能按照航线行驶，非常值得信赖。它的罗盘从未出错。它从来不给人惹麻烦，好像它这大把年纪反倒给了它知识、智慧和稳健。它的靠岸方位准确无误，而且几乎跟规定时间分秒不差。无论何时，只要他坐在船桥上，不需要抬头看，或者是醒着躺在床上，只要计算一下天数和钟头，就能说出他在哪里——航线上的精确地点。他还很清楚地知道，这是往返于马六甲海峡的单调的巡回买卖航行；他了解那一带的风俗、风景和居民情况。轮船的第一站是马六甲，白天靠岸，傍晚出发，横渡这条远东地区的交通要道，带着死板的闪着磷光的尾波。水面上一片黑暗，微光闪闪，漆黑的天空中明星高悬，也许有当地的一艘轮船载着点点灯光笔直地行驶在航道中央，也可能有一条当地的小船挂着用棕榈叶编织的帆静静掠过——在白天则能看见另一面低洼的陆地。中午时分，看见了三棵棕榈树，也就是下一个停靠地点了，此时轮船行驶在一条水流迟缓的河上，溯流而上。居住在那里的唯一一个白人，是个已经退役的年轻海军官员，惠利船长在这条航线上来来往往很多回，和他结下了友情。再向前行驶六十英里，就到了另一个停靠地点，即海滩上只有几所房子的深水湾。就这样来来回回，在沿岸附近装运货物，最后，在迷宫一样的群岛之间，轮船按照固定的航线再行驶一百英里，来到当地的一个大城镇，便结束了它的航程。那艘老船可以休息三天，然后他驾驶着船原路返回，从另一个方位看相同的海岸，在相同的地方听相同的声音，再回到远东地区交通要道上苏法拉号的船籍港，在港务局的那幢石头大厦对面附近，他会为船找上一个泊位，直到再次开始那重复了无数回的一千六百英里的三十天航程。对船长惠利，亨利·惠利，或者说是对天不怕地不怕的哈里——神鹰号的惠利来说，这不是什么雄心勃勃的生活，当初神鹰号可是一艘有名的快速帆船呢。确实不是。对一个曾经为著名的商号干过活的人，对一个驾驶过许多名船——他自己拥有的就不止一两艘——的人来说，这算不上什么雄心勃勃的生活；他有过几次著名的航行，他还是新航线和新贸易的拓荒者；他曾驾船横渡南洋的那些未经测量的广阔海域，看到太阳从航海图上尚未标明的岛屿上升起。他在海上漂泊了五十年，其中有四十多年是在东方（“十分彻底的训练期，”他过去经常这样微笑着说），这使得从孟买开始，一直到东方连接西方南北美洲海岸的所有港口的整整一代船主和商人，都认识他、尊敬他。他的名声镌刻在了航海图上，虽然不是很大，却清清楚楚。在澳大利亚和中国之间的某处，不是有座惠利岛和一片神鹰礁吗？那艘有名的快速帆船，曾经在那片危险的珊瑚层上搁浅了三天，船长和船员用一只手把货物扔出船外，可以说又用另一只手使他们那艘船避开了一队土著的独木战船。无论是那座岛，还是那片礁石，那时在官方资料上都还不存在呢。后来，英国政府派遣官员驾驶着火枪手号轮船，对那条航线进行勘察，才开始采用这两个地名，认可了惠利船长的进取精神和船的坚固性。此外，留心的人还可能发现在《航海大全》的第二卷第410页上看到，在描述“马洛托或者惠利航道”时，是以这样的字句开始的：“这条有益的航线是由神鹰号的惠利船长在1850年首先发现的，”等等，最后，该书向从十二月起至四月底之间离开中国港口向南行驶的帆船热情洋溢地推荐了这条航线。","He could not hope to see anything new upon this lane of the sea.He had been on these coasts for the last three years.From Low Cape to Malantan the distance was fifty miles, six hours’ steaming for the old ship with the tide, or seven against.Then you steered straight for the land, and by-and-by three palms would appear on the sky, tall and slim, and with their disheveled heads in a bunch, as if in confidential criticism of the dark mangroves.The Sofala would be headed towards the somber strip of the coast, which at a given moment, as the ship closed with it obliquely, would show several clean shining fractures—the brimful estuary of a river.Then on through a brown liquid, three parts water and one part black earth, on and on between the low shores, three parts black earth and one part brackish water, the Sofala would plow her way up-stream, as she had done once every month for these seven years or more, long before he was aware of her existence, long before he had ever thought of having anything to do with her and her invariable voyages.The old ship ought to have known the road better than her men, who had not been kept so long at it without a change; better than the faithful Serang, whom he had brought over from his last ship to keep the captain’s watch; better than he himself, who had been her captain for the last three years only.She could always be depended upon to make her courses.Her compasses were never out.She was no trouble at all to take about, as if her great age had given her knowledge, wisdom, and steadiness.She made her landfalls to a degree of the bearing, and almost to a minute of her allowed time.At any moment, as he sat on the bridge without looking up, or lay sleepless in his bed, simply by reckoning the days and the hours he could tell where he was—the precise spot of the beat.He knew it well too, this monotonous huckster’s round, up and down the Straits; he knew its order and its sights and its people.Malacca to begin with, in at daylight and out at dusk, to cross over with a rigid phosphorescent wake this highway of the Far East.Darkness and gleams on the water, clear stars on a black sky, perhaps the lights of a home steamer keeping her unswerving course in the middle, or maybe the elusive shadow of a native craft with her mat sails flitting by silently—and the low land on the other side in sight at daylight.At noon the three palms of the next place of call, up a sluggish river.The only white man residing there was a retired young sailor, with whom he had become friendly in the course of many voyages.Sixty miles farther on there was another place of call, a deep bay with only a couple of houses on the beach.And so on, in and out, picking up coastwise cargo here and there, and finishing with a hundred miles’ steady steaming through the maze of an archipelago of small islands up to a large native town at the end of the beat.There was a three days’ rest for the old ship before he started her again in inverse order, seeing the same shores from another bearing, hearing the same voices in the same places, back again to the Sofala’s port of registry on the great highway to the East, where he would take up a berth nearly opposite the big stone pile of the harbor office till it was time to start again on the old round of 1600 miles and thirty days.Not a very enterprising life, this, for Captain Whalley, Henry Whalley, otherwise Dare-devil Harry—Whalley of the Condor, a famous clipper in her day.No.Not a very enterprising life for a man who had served famous firms, who had sailed famous ships (more than one or two of them his own); who had made famous passages, had been the pioneer of new routes and new trades; who had steered across the unsurveyed tracts of the South Seas, and had seen the sun rise on uncharted islands.Fifty years at sea, and forty out in the East (“a pretty thorough apprenticeship,” he used to remark smilingly), had made him honorably known to a generation of shipowners and merchants in all the ports from Bombay clear over to where the East merges into the West upon the coast of the two Americas.His fame remained writ, not very large but plain enough, on the Admiralty charts.Was there not somewhere between Australia and China a Whalley Island and a Condor Reef?On that dangerous coral formation the celebrated clipper had hung stranded for three days, her captain and crew throwing her cargo overboard with one hand and with the other, as it were, keeping off her a flotilla of savage war-canoes.At that time neither the island nor the reef had any official existence.Later the officers of her Majesty’s steam vessel Fusilier, dispatched to make a survey of the route, recognized in the adoption of these two names the enterprise of the man and the solidity of the ship.Besides, as anyone who cares may see, the “General Directory,” vol. ii. p. 410, begins the description of the “Malotu or Whalley Passage” with the words: “This advantageous route, first discovered in 1850 by Captain Whalley in the ship Condor,” &c., and ends by recommending it warmly to sailing vessels leaving the China ports for the south in the months from December to April inclusive."
"这是他一生中最显著的收获。没有任何东西能抢走他的这种名声。苏伊士运河的开通，犹如一个水坝开了口，给东方带来了大量新的船只，新的人，新的贸易方式。这改变了东方海洋的面貌和当地人的精神状态；所以他的早年经历，无论是什么，对新一代的海员来说，都无足轻重了。","This was the clearest gain he had out of life.Nothing could rob him of this kind of fame.The piercing of the Isthmus of Suez, like the breaking of a dam, had let in upon the East a flood of new ships, new men, new methods of trade.It had changed the face of the Eastern seas and the very spirit of their life; so that his early experiences meant nothing whatever to the new generation of seamen."
"在那些过去的日子里，他曾经处理过成千上万镑的钱，既有雇主的，也有他自己的；他忠心耿耿地处理货主、租船者和承销商三者之间互相冲突的利益关系，像一个船主应该做到的那样。他从未损失过一艘船，或者同意过一桩肮脏的交易；他一直干得很好，并凭借着这些条件获得了名声，但是最后他陷入了困境。他埋葬了他的妻子（在佩奇里湾），嫁出去了不幸选错对象的女儿，又遭遇了那次无人不知的特拉凡哥尔和德干银行公司倒闭事件，他不仅损失了足以让他过上舒适生活的财富，而且这次倒闭像地震一样撼动了东方世界。而且他已经六十五岁了。","In those bygone days he had handled many thousands of pounds of his employers’ money and of his own; he had attended faithfully, as by law a shipmaster is expected to do, to the conflicting interests of owners, charterers, and underwriters.He had never lost a ship or consented to a shady transaction; and he had lasted well, outlasting in the end the conditions that had gone to the making of his name.He had buried his wife (in the Gulf of Petchili), had married off his daughter to the man of her unlucky choice, and had lost more than an ample competence in the crash of the notorious Travancore and Deccan Banking Corporation, whose downfall had shaken the East like an earthquake.And he was sixty-five years old."
"第二章","II "
"看不出来他有那么大年纪；而且他不为自己的破产感到羞愧。并非只有他一个人相信银行的可靠性。有些人在金融方面的判断同他的航海技术一样老练，还称赞过他投资谨慎，可他们也在那次大倒闭中损失了很多钱。他和他们唯一的区别在于他损失了全部财产。然而，也算不上全部。从他失去的财产中，他留下了一艘十分漂亮的三桅帆船“美人号”，买这艘船是因为想用它来消磨退休后的空闲时间，像他自己说的那样，就是“玩玩”。","His age sat lightly enough on him; and of his ruin he was not ashamed.He had not been alone to believe in the stability of the Banking Corporation.Men whose judgment in matters of finance was as expert as his seamanship had commended the prudence of his investments, and had themselves lost much money in the great failure.The only difference between him and them was that he had lost his all.And yet not his all.There had remained to him from his lost fortune a very pretty little bark, Fair Maid, which he had bought to occupy his leisure of a retired sailor—“to play with,” as he expressed it himself."
"他女儿结婚的前一年，他正式宣布自己对海洋感到厌倦了。但是在那对年轻的夫妇去墨尔本定居以后，他发现他无法在陆地上开心地生活。他是一个十足的远洋贸易船的船长，仅坐游艇是无法令他满足的。他需要一点继续忙碌下去的幻觉；得到了美人号，仿佛他就能维持生活的连续性。他把美人号介绍给不同港口的熟人，说是“我指挥的最后一艘船”。当他老到不能再驾驶一艘船的时候，他就会把美人号搁置起来，回到陆地，直到入土为安。他还会留下遗嘱，指示在举行葬礼的那天把那艘三桅帆船拖出来，让它在深海体面地沉没。他知道，女儿不会不满足他这个愿望的，在他死后，不会有陌生人染指他驾驶的最后这艘船。与他能留给她的财产比起来，一艘五百吨的三桅帆船的价值就无关紧要了。他会用一种开玩笑的态度说出这一切，眼里闪着光。这个精力充沛的老人充满了活力，不会染上什么后悔的伤感主义，反而会带着一点渴望什么的心情，因为他很会生活，能够从生活给予他的感情和福祉中，从声望和财富带来的尊严中，从他对女儿的爱中，从他对那艘船的满足中得到真实的快乐——即使那艘船只是他打发孤独闲暇的玩物。","He had formally declared himself tired of the sea the year preceding his daughter’s marriage.But after the young couple had gone to settle in Melbourne he found out that he could not make himself happy on shore.He was too much of a merchant sea-captain for mere yachting to satisfy him.He wanted the illusion of affairs; and his acquisition of the Fair Maid preserved the continuity of his life.He introduced her to his acquaintances in various ports as “my last command.” When he grew too old to be trusted with a ship, he would lay her up and go ashore to be buried, leaving directions in his will to have the bark towed out and scuttled decently in deep water on the day of the funeral.His daughter would not grudge him the satisfaction of knowing that no stranger would handle his last command after him.With the fortune he was able to leave her, the value of a 500-ton bark was neither here nor there.All this would be said with a jocular twinkle in his eye: the vigorous old man had too much vitality for the sentimentalism of regret; and a little wistfully withal, because he was at home in life, taking a genuine pleasure in its feelings and its possessions; in the dignity of his reputation and his wealth, in his love for his daughter, and in his satisfaction with the ship—the plaything of his lonely leisure."
"他按照自己简单的理想来布置船舱，以使他的海上生活舒适。一个大书柜占去了他卧舱的一面（他是个博览群书的人）；正对着床位的是他已故妻子的肖像画，那是一幅无景深的沥青油画，画上是个长着黑色卷发的年轻女人的侧面像。三个航行表滴答滴答地走着，像比赛似的用微小而有节奏的声音催他入睡，又迎接他醒来。他每天五点钟起床。值早班的高级船员在船尾舵轮旁喝早咖啡的时候，会从很大的铜通风孔里听到船长在盥洗室发出的泼水声、擤鼻子声、清嗓子声。这些响声之后，接着传来的是用响亮而热切的嗓音背诵祈祷词的持续而低沉的声音。五分钟后，惠利船长的头和肩膀就从升降口的扶梯上出现了。他总是在扶梯上停留片刻，看看周围的地平线，向上看看风帆的情况，然后深深地吸几口新鲜空气。直到那时，他才会登上船尾楼，向那个一只手举起在帽檐旁的船员庄严而和蔼地打招呼说：“早上好。”他在甲板上认真负责地巡视到八点钟。有时候，一年不超过两次，由于髋关节僵硬，他不得不使用一根粗手杖走路——他认为是轻微的风湿病。此外，他不知道他的身体还有什么毛病。早餐钟一响，他就下去喂他的金丝雀，给航行表上紧发条，然后坐上餐桌的首位。从那里看去，他眼前是一些装在黑边玻璃框里的碳纸印的大照片，他女儿和女婿的，还有两个腿胖嘟嘟的孩子的——他的外孙——相框镶嵌在小船室的槭木舱壁上。早餐后，他用一块布亲自拂去覆盖着肖像的相框玻璃上的灰尘，接着从那个沉重的金色画框旁一个小铜钩上，取下挂在那上面的羽毛掸子，刷他妻子的肖像油画。然后他会关上卧舱门，坐在肖像画下面的沙发上，拿起那本厚厚的袖珍版《圣经》——她的《圣经》，读上一章。但有些日子，他只是在那里坐上半个小时，手指夹在书页中间，书合着摆在膝头上。也许他突然想起了妻子过去是多么喜欢航行。","He had the cabin arranged in accordance with his simple ideal of comfort at sea.A big bookcase (he was a great reader) occupied one side of his stateroom; the portrait of his late wife, a flat bituminous oil-painting representing the profile and one long black ringlet of a young woman, faced his bed-place.Three chronometers ticked him to sleep and greeted him on waking with the tiny competition of their beats.He rose at five every day.The officer of the morning watch, drinking his early cup of coffee aft by the wheel, would hear through the wide orifice of the copper ventilators all the splashings, blowings, and splutterings of his captain’s toilet.These noises would be followed by a sustained deep murmur of the Lord’s Prayer recited in a loud earnest voice.Five minutes afterwards the head and shoulders of Captain Whalley emerged out of the companion-hatchway.Invariably he paused for a while on the stairs, looking all round at the horizon; upwards at the trim of the sails; inhaling deep draughts of the fresh air.Only then he would step out on the poop, acknowledging the hand raised to the peak of the cap with a majestic and benign “Good morning to you.” He walked the deck till eight scrupulously.Sometimes, not above twice a year, he had to use a thick cudgel-like stick on account of a stiffness in the hip—a slight touch of rheumatism, he supposed.Otherwise he knew nothing of the ills of the flesh.At the ringing of the breakfast bell he went below to feed his canaries, wind up the chronometers, and take the head of the table.From there he had before his eyes the big carbon photographs of his daughter, her husband, and two fat-legged babies —his grandchildren—set in black frames into the maplewood bulkheads of the cuddy.After breakfast he dusted the glass over these portraits himself with a cloth, and brushed the oil painting of his wife with a plumate kept suspended from a small brass hook by the side of the heavy gold frame.Then with the door of his stateroom shut, he would sit down on the couch under the portrait to read a chapter out of a thick pocket Bible—her Bible.But on some days he only sat there for half an hour with his finger between the leaves and the closed book resting on his knees.Perhaps he had remembered suddenly how fond of boat-sailing she used to be."
"她确实是一个航行的好伴侣，也是一个真正的女人。犹如一个信条，他坚信无论是在海上还是在陆地上，没有哪里能比他神鹰号船尾楼甲板下面那个家美满、愉快，那个宽大的主舱主色调是白色和金色，好像永远在欢度节日一样，装饰着永不凋谢的花环。她在每一块嵌板中央都画了一束故乡的鲜花。为了这项爱的工程，她整整用了十二个月的时间才画遍了整个舱房。对他而言，这些画始终是一个奇迹，无论是品味还是技巧，都达到了最高成就；对他的大副老斯温伯恩而言，他每次走下来吃饭，看到这项工作的进展的时候，总会充满赞赏，发呆般地站在那里。他说，那段时间，嗅着那股弥漫在餐室里的微弱的松节油味，你几乎能闻到玫瑰的香味，（他后来承认）这使他吃东西的时候胃口比平时差一点。但是没有什么能妨碍他对她歌唱的享受。每当他通过天窗投入地听她一曲唱罢以后，会带着品评般的口气说：“惠利太太是只真正的夜莺，先生。”在晴好的天气里，值黄昏六点到八点那一班的时候，两个人就能听到从船舱里传来的、在钢琴伴奏下的她的颤音和华彩。钢琴是他们订婚的那天他写信到伦敦去买的；但是在他们结婚一年多之后，货才绕过好望角运达。那个大箱子是第一批到达香港的直运货物的中的一件——这件事对那些现今在繁忙的码头上奔走的人来说，似乎同历史上的中世纪那样遥远而模糊。但是惠利船长能够在半个小时的独处中重温他一生的悲欢离合。他不得不亲手合上了她的眼睛。她像一个海员的妻子那样在商船旗下离世；在内心，她自己就是个海员。他用她自己的祈祷书为她念祈祷词，声音一次也没有停顿。当他抬起眼睛的时候，看到老斯温伯恩正面对着他，帽子紧贴胸口，泪水从他那皱纹密布、饱经风霜、毫无表情的脸上不断地流下来，好像淋在雨中的一块历经刀斫斧凿的红色花岗石一般。那个老水手还不如放声哭出来好受。他不得不把祈祷词念完；但是把她的遗体扑通一声扔进水里以后，接下来的几天里，他都不记得发生了什么。船上有位精通针线活的老水手，用她的一条黑裙子为孩子做了一件丧服。","She had been a real shipmate and a true woman too.It was like an article of faith with him that there never had been, and never could be, a brighter, cheerier home anywhere afloat or ashore than his home under the poop-deck of the Condor, with the big main cabin all white and gold, garlanded as if for a perpetual festival with an unfading wreath.She had decorated the center of every panel with a cluster of home flowers.It took her a twelvemonth to go round the cuddy with this labor of love.To him it had remained a marvel of painting, the highest achievement of taste and skill; and as to old Swinburne, his mate, every time he came down to his meals he stood transfixed with admiration before the progress of the work.You could almost smell these roses, he declared, sniffing the faint flavor of turpentine which at that time pervaded the saloon, and (as he confessed afterwards) made him somewhat less hearty than usual in tackling his food.But there was nothing of the sort to interfere with his enjoyment of her singing.“Mrs. Whalley is a regular out-and-out nightingale, sir,” he would pronounce with a judicial air after listening profoundly over the skylight to the very end of the piece.In fine weather, in the second dog-watch, the two men could hear her trills and roulades going on to the accompaniment of the piano in the cabin.On the very day they got engaged he had written to London for the instrument; but they had been married for over a year before it reached them, coming out round the Cape.The big case made part of the first direct general cargo landed in Hong-kong harbor—an event that to the men who walked the busy quays of to-day seemed as hazily remote as the dark ages of history.But Captain Whalley could in a half hour of solitude live again all his life, with its romance, its idyl, and its sorrow.He had to close her eyes himself.She went away from under the ensign like a sailor’s wife, a sailor herself at heart.He had read the service over her, out of her own prayer-book, without a break in his voice.When he raised his eyes he could see old Swinburne facing him with his cap pressed to his breast, and his rugged, weather-beaten, impassive face streaming with drops of water like a lump of chipped red granite in a shower.It was all very well for that old sea-dog to cry.He had to read on to the end; but after the splash he did not remember much of what happened for the next few days.An elderly sailor of the crew, deft at needlework, put together a mourning frock for the child out of one of her black skirts."
"他不可能忘记；不过你无法把像缓慢的溪流一样的生活，用坝拦住。生活会冲破缺口，淹没人的烦恼；生活会遮蔽悲伤，就像海洋遮蔽一具尸体一样，而不管有多少爱沉入海底。但是这个世界还不算坏。人们对他很友好；特别是加德纳太太，加德纳-佩特逊公司的大股东的妻子，这个公司就是神鹰号的所有者。就是她自愿照顾那个小女孩的，而且在适当的时候把她带到了英国（在那些日子里，就算按照横穿大陆的邮路走，也算得上长途跋涉了），同她自己的几个女儿一同完成学业。过了十年，他才再次见到她。","He was not likely to forget; but you cannot dam up life like a sluggish stream.It will break out and flow over a man’s troubles, it will close upon a sorrow like the sea upon a dead body, no matter how much love has gone to the bottom.And the world is not bad.People had been very kind to him; especially Mrs. Gardner, the wife of the senior partner in Gardner, Patteson, & Co., the owners of the Condor.It was she who volunteered to look after the little one, and in due course took her to England (something of a journey in those days, even by the overland mail route) with her own girls to finish her education.It was ten years before he saw her again."
"当她还是个小孩子的时候，就从没有怕过坏天气；她会央求他把她抱在他穿着油衣的怀里，带到甲板上去，看着巨浪拍打神鹰号。波浪的涌起和破碎，看起来使她那幼小的心灵充满了几乎喘不过气来的兴奋。“一个宠坏了的假小子，”他过去常这样开玩笑地说她。他给她取名艾薇，因为喜欢这个名字的发音，同时，他被一个模糊不清的联想暗暗地迷住了。她紧紧地缠绕在他的心头，而他也愿意她紧紧地缠着她的父亲，犹如缠着一根坚固的支柱；他忘了，按照事物的常理，年幼的她也有可能选择紧紧地缠住其他人。但是他那么地热爱生活，那件事除了让他有种切身的怅然若失的感觉之外，也给他带来了某种满足。","As a little child she had never been frightened of bad weather; she would beg to be taken up on deck in the bosom of his oilskin coat to watch the big seas hurling themselves upon the Condor.The swirl and crash of the waves seemed to fill her small soul with a breathless delight.“A good boy spoiled,” he used to say of her in joke.He had named her Ivy because of the sound of the word, and obscurely fascinated by a vague association of ideas.She had twined herself tightly round his heart, and he intended her to cling close to her father as to a tower of strength; forgetting, while she was little, that in the nature of things she would probably elect to cling to someone else.But he loved life well enough for even that event to give him a certain satisfaction, apart from his more intimate feeling of loss."
" 他买下美人号来排遣孤独以后，就迫不及待地接受了一次到澳大利亚去的、几乎是无利可图的货运买卖，仅仅是为了趁着这个机会去看望在那里安家的女儿。在那里让他感到不满意的，倒不是看到她现在紧紧地缠着另一个人，而是她挑中的支柱，在他认真审视之下，似乎是 “一根相当差劲的木棍”——即使就健康状况而论，也是如此。他不喜欢他女婿的装模作样的礼貌，可能超过了不喜欢那个人对待艾薇结婚时他给她的那笔钱的处理方法。但是他丝毫没有透露他的忧虑。仅仅在他离开的那天，门厅的门打开的时候，他握住她的手，盯着她的眼睛说：“你知道，亲爱的，我的一切都是你和孩子的。别忘了写信给我，不要隐瞒任何事情。”她只是几乎难以察觉地点了下头，算作对他的回答。她眼睛的颜色，还有她的性格，都像她母亲——这一点也像， 说话不多，却理解他。","After he had purchased the Fair Maid to occupy his loneliness, he hastened to accept a rather unprofitable freight to Australia simply for the opportunity of seeing his daughter in her own home.What made him dissatisfied there was not to see that she clung now to somebody else, but that the prop she had selected seemed on closer examination “a rather poor stick”—even in the matter of health.He disliked his son-in-law’s studied civility perhaps more than his method of handling the sum of money he had given Ivy at her marriage.But of his apprehensions he said nothing.Only on the day of his departure, with the hall-door open already, holding her hands and looking steadily into her eyes, he had said, “You know, my dear, all I have is for you and the chicks.Mind you write to me openly.” She had answered him by an almost imperceptible movement of her head.She resembled her mother in the color of her eyes, and in character—and also in this, that she understood him without many words."
" 她当然会写信，而有些信会使惠利船长竖起他白色的眉毛。至于其余的信，他能够做到有求必应，他认为这是在收获他生命中真正意义上的报酬。自从他妻子去世以来，他还从来没有这么高兴过。他女婿的不断失败反而使他对远方那个人感到了某种亲切，这很符合他女婿的性格。这个家伙一直被踩压在困境之中，但把这一切统统归咎于他那粗心大意的航海术，显然是不公平的。不，不！他很清楚这是怎么回事。是女婿运气不好。而他自己只是运气好罢了，但是他在生活中看到太多的好人——海员和其他人——在厄运的不可抗拒的压力下，认不出那些致命的迹象，导致了破产。紧接着开始了沸沸扬扬的传言（他第一次是碰巧在上海听到风声的），大倒闭来了，尽管如此，他还是考虑要用最好的办法牢牢握住他必须留给女儿的每一分钱。他先是目瞪口呆，接着是难以置信，然后是愤怒，最终不得不接受事实：他没有留下什么值得一提的财产。","Sure enough she had to write; and some of these letters made Captain Whalley lift his white eye-brows.For the rest he considered he was reaping the true reward of his life by being thus able to produce on demand whatever was needed.He had not enjoyed himself so much in a way since his wife had died.Characteristically enough his son-in-law’s punctuality in failure caused him at a distance to feel a sort of kindness towards the man.The fellow was so perpetually being jammed on a lee shore that to charge it all to his reckless navigation would be manifestly unfair.No, no!He knew well what that meant.It was bad luck.His own had been simply marvelous, but he had seen in his life too many good men—seamen and others—go under with the sheer weight of bad luck not to recognize the fatal signs.For all that, he was cogitating on the best way of tying up very strictly every penny he had to leave, when, with a preliminary rumble of rumors (whose first sound reached him in Shanghai as it happened), the shock of the big failure came; and, after passing through the phases of stupor, of incredulity, of indignation, he had to accept the fact that he had nothing to speak of to leave."
"接着，好像他正在等待那场灾祸似的，远在墨尔本的那个不幸的人放弃了他无利可图的买卖，坐了下来，而且是坐在了残废者的轮椅上。“他再也不能走路了。”他的妻子在信上写道。惠利船长有生以来第一次被震惊了。","Upon that, as if he had only waited for this catastrophe, the unlucky man, away there in Melbourne, gave up his unprofitable game, and sat down—in an invalid’s bath-chair at that too.“He will never walk again,” wrote the wife.For the first time in his life Captain Whalley was a bit staggered."
"现在美人号不得不去卖力地工作了。原来它是用来给天不怕地不怕的哈里·惠利保持他在东方海洋上的记忆的，或者是用来给一个老人挣零花钱和衣服钱的，也许是用来给他在年底新添的几百支一流雪茄买单的，而如今不再是那样的情况了。他不得不全力以赴，而且因为要靠微薄的收入来维持从船头到船尾那些华而不实的装饰，他不得不使它不断辛苦地奔波。","The Fair Maid had to go to work in bitter earnest now.It was no longer a matter of preserving alive the memory of Dare-devil Harry Whalley in the Eastern Seas, or of keeping an old man in pocket-money and clothes, with, perhaps, a bill for a few hundred first-class cigars thrown in at the end of the year.He would have to buckle-to, and keep her going hard on a scant allowance of gilt for the ginger-bread scrolls at her stem and stern."
" 拮据的生活使他睁开了眼睛，看到世界已经发生了根本变化。到处都只剩下他过去熟悉的那些名字，可是他熟悉的那些事情和人已不复存在。加德纳-佩特逊公司的名字仍然呈现在水边仓库的墙上，在不止一个东方海港的商业区的铜牌上和窗玻璃上，但是公司里不再有一个姓加德纳或佩特逊的人了。不再有人欢迎惠利船长到那间私人办公室去，请他坐在扶手椅上；由于他过去在这家公司干过，所以公司随时都准备提供给老朋友一点生意。加德纳老人在世的时候，惠利离职很久以后还一直保持着进入那间办公室的权利，加德纳的那几个女婿坐在那个房间的办公桌后面。这家公司的船现在都是加了黑色盖子的黄烟囱，而且跟那令人讨厌的电车一样，都有一张指定路线的时刻表。对那些船来说，十二月的风和六月的风是一样的；那些船长（他并不怀疑他们是优秀的的年轻人）的确是对惠利岛很熟悉，因为近年来，政府在岛的北头装了一盏白色的固定灯（标出神鹰礁是红色的危险区），但是他们大多数人听到惠利还好端端地活着的时候，都非常惊讶——一个在世界各地奔走，设法为他那小小的三桅帆船到处兜揽货物运输的老人。","This necessity opened his eyes to the fundamental changes of the world.Of his past only the familiar names remained, here and there, but the things and the men, as he had known them, were gone.The name of Gardner, Patteson, & Co. was still displayed on the walls of warehouses by the waterside, on the brass plates and window-panes in the business quarters of more than one Eastern port, but there was no longer a Gardner or a Patteson in the firm.There was no longer for Captain Whalley an arm-chair and a welcome in the private office, with a bit of business ready to be put in the way of an old friend, for the sake of bygone services.The husbands of the Gardner girls sat behind the desks in that room where, long after he had left the employ, he had kept his right of entrance in the old man’s time.Their ships now had yellow funnels with black tops, and a time-table of appointed routes like a confounded service of tramways.The winds of December and June were all one to them; their captains (excellent young men he doubted not) were, to be sure, familiar with Whalley Island, because of late years the Government had established a white fixed light on the north end (with a red danger sector over the Condor Reef), but most of them would have been extremely surprised to hear that a flesh-and-blood Whalley still existed—an old man going about the world trying to pick up a cargo here and there for his little bark."
"到处都是一样的。那些听见别人提起他的名字就会赞赏地点头的人，那些认为出于纪念应该为天不怕地不怕的哈里·惠利做些事情的人都去世了。那些他知道如何去抓住的机会都过去了；那些生活在汹涌澎湃、反复无常的风浪中，从海洋中汲取了大量财富，成群结队鼓着白色风帆的快速帆船，也跟那些机会一起消失了。在这个利润被减少到最低限度的世界上，在这个每天能计算出两次空闲吨位的世界上，在这个三个月前就被人用电报抢走那少的可怜的租船契约的世界上，一个驾着一艘三桅帆船漫无目地漂在海上的人，是没有什么发财机会的——说真的，几乎没有任何生存空间。","And everywhere it was the same.Departed the men who would have nodded appreciatively at the mention of his name, and would have thought themselves bound in honor to do something for Dare-devil Harry Whalley.Departed the opportunities which he would have known how to seize; and gone with them the white-winged flock of clippers that lived in the boisterous uncertain life of the winds, skimming big fortunes out of the foam of the sea.In a world that pared down the profits to an irreducible minimum, in a world that was able to count its disengaged tonnage twice over every day, and in which lean charters were snapped up by cable three months in advance, there were no chances of fortune for an individual wandering haphazard with a little bark—hardly indeed any room to exist."
"他发现生活一年比一年艰难。他只能寄给女儿数额很小的汇款，心里非常痛苦。与此同时，他已经放弃了抽高级雪茄，就算是下等的方头雪茄，他一天也只限抽六只。他从未告诉女儿他的困难，而她也从未详说过她生活的艰辛。他们彼此信任，无需任何解释，他们互相非常了解，从来不需要什么感激或者抱歉的声明。如果她心血来潮，说出很多感谢他的话，他倒会感到震惊，但是她要是对他说她需要二百镑的话，他会觉得这是完全正常的事情。","He found it more difficult from year to year.He suffered greatly from the smallness of remittances he was able to send his daughter.Meantime he had given up good cigars, and even in the matter of inferior cheroots limited himself to six a day.He never told her of his difficulties, and she never enlarged upon her struggle to live.Their confidence in each other needed no explanations, and their perfect understanding endured without protestations of gratitude or regret.He would have been shocked if she had taken it into her head to thank him in so many words, but he found it perfectly natural that she should tell him she needed two hundred pounds."
"他驾着只装了一些压舱货的美人号，来到苏法拉号的船籍港找货运生意，在那里他接到了女儿的来信。信的大意是，说话遮遮掩掩是没有用的。她唯一的办法就是开个膳宿公寓，她判断干这一行是有前途的。无论如何，她是觉得有前途，才坦白地告诉他的，只要有二百镑，她的生意就可以起步了。这封信是一个船用杂货商的佣人亲手交给他的，船一抛锚，那个人就把信送来了。他在甲板上匆忙地把信封拆开。他有生以来第二次被震惊了，他一动不动地站在船舱门口，拿着信笺的手指直发抖。开一家膳宿公寓！二百镑的开办费!唯一的办法！但是他连去什么地方弄二百便士都不知道。","He had come in with the Fair Maid in ballast to look for a freight in the Sofala’s port of registry, and her letter met him there.Its tenor was that it was no use mincing matters.Her only resource was in opening a boarding-house, for which the prospects, she judged, were good.Good enough, at any rate, to make her tell him frankly that with two hundred pounds she could make a start.He had torn the envelope open, hastily, on deck, where it was handed to him by the ship-chandler’s runner, who had brought his mail at the moment of anchoring.For the second time in his life he was appalled, and remained stock-still at the cabin door with the paper trembling between his fingers.Open a boarding-house!Two hundred pounds for a start!The only resource!And he did not know where to lay his hands on two hundred pence."
"惠利船长在那艘抛了锚的船的船尾楼上转悠了整整一夜，好像在海上航行了许多天，一直看不到太阳、月亮或者星星，在阴霾的天气中即将靠近陆地，可又不确定他的方位似的。黑夜里闪烁着海员们指路的灯光和岸上固定而笔直的灯光；停在美人号周围的所有船上的锚灯把一道道颤抖的灯光投射在锚地的水面上。而不管在哪里，惠利船长都看不到一丝微光，直到黎明，他发现自己的衣服完全被厚重的露水打湿了。","All that night Captain Whalley walked the poop of his anchored ship, as though he had been about to close with the land in thick weather, and uncertain of his position after a run of many gray days without a sight of sun, moon, or stars.The black night twinkled with the guiding lights of seamen and the steady straight lines of lights on shore; and all around the Fair Maid the riding lights of ships cast trembling trails upon the water of the roadstead.Captain Whalley saw not a gleam anywhere till the dawn broke and he found out that his clothing was soaked through with the heavy dew."
"他的船醒了。他突然站住脚，摸摸他潮湿的胡须，双脚疲惫地倒退着走下了船尾楼的扶梯。那个大副睡眼惺忪地在后甲板上闲逛，大清早张大了嘴打哈欠，一看到他，嘴张着合不拢了。","His ship was awake.He stopped short, stroked his wet beard, and descended the poop ladder backwards, with tired feet.At the sight of him the chief officer, lounging about sleepily on the quarterdeck, remained open-mouthed in the middle of a great early-morning yawn."
"“早上好。”惠利船长边严肃地说着，边走进了船舱。但是他在门口站住了，没有回头看。“顺便问一下，”他说，“在贮藏室里应该放着一个空木箱。它还没有坏掉——是吗？”","“Good morning to you,” pronounced Captain Whalley solemnly, passing into the cabin.But he checked himself in the doorway, and without looking back, “By the bye,” he said, “there should be an empty wooden case put away in the lazarette.It has not been broken up—has it?” "
"大副闭上嘴，然后好像有些茫然的问道：“什么空箱子，先生？”","The mate shut his mouth, and then asked as if dazed, “What empty case, sir?” "
" “一个大的扁扁的包装箱，原来是用它存放我房间里那张画的。找人把箱子拿到甲板上来，告诉木工仔细检查一下。我也许不久以后就要用它。”","“A big flat packing-case belonging to that painting in my room.Let it be taken up on deck and tell the carpenter to look it over.I may want to use it before long.” "
"大副站着，纹丝不动，直到他听见船室里船长的睡舱门砰的一声关上。接着他在船尾用食指示意二副，告诉他有什么事“快要发生了”。","The chief officer did not stir a limb till he had heard the door of the captain’s state-room slam within the cuddy.Then he beckoned aft the second mate with his forefinger to tell him that there was something “in the wind.” "
"当早饭钟响的时候，惠利船长那威严的声音透过关着的房门洪亮地传出来：“入座吧，不要等我。”这使他的那些高级船员颇感意外，他们坐到自己的位置上，隔着桌子交换眼神，窃窃私语。什么！不吃早饭？而且显然还在甲板上转悠了整整一夜！无疑，有什么事情快要发生了。他们低着头认真地对着盘子吃饭，头上的那扇天窗里，三只饥饿的金丝雀焦躁不安地跳着，使那三个金属丝鸟笼摇摇晃晃，咯咯作响，而他们能够听到睡舱里传来“老头子的”从容不迫的动作所发出的声音。惠利船长有条不紊地给那三个航行表上紧发条，掸去他亡妻肖像画上的灰尘，从橱柜里取出一件干净的白衬衫，穿戴好，显出一副一丝不苟、不慌不忙的模样，上了岸。那天早晨，他一口东西也吃不下。他已经下定决心，要卖掉美人号了。","When the bell rang Captain Whalley’s authoritative voice boomed out through a closed door, “Sit down and don’t wait for me.” And his impressed officers took their places, exchanging looks and whispers across the table.What!No breakfast?And after apparently knocking about all night on deck, too!Clearly, there was something in the wind.In the skylight above their heads, bowed earnestly over the plates, three wire cages rocked and rattled to the restless jumping of the hungry canaries; and they could detect the sounds of their “old man’s” deliberate movements within his state-room.Captain Whalley was methodically winding up the chronometers, dusting the portrait of his late wife, getting a clean white shirt out of the drawers, making himself ready in his punctilious unhurried manner to go ashore.He could not have swallowed a single mouthful of food that morning.He had made up his mind to sell the Fair Maid."
"第三章","III "
"恰逢当时日本人在世界各地买进欧洲制造的船，所以惠利船长毫不费力地找到了买主，这个投机商极力地讨价还价，然而考虑到转售是有利可图的，他还是为美人号支付了现金。接下来的事情是这样的：一天下午惠利船长发现自己从一个邮局的台阶上走下来，这个邮局是东方最重要的邮局之一，他手里还拿着一张浅蓝色的纸。这是一封寄往墨尔本的挂号信的收据，信中装着一张二百镑的汇票。惠利把那张收据塞进马甲口袋，从胳肢窝底下拿出手杖，然后走上街去。","Just at that time the Japanese were casting far and wide for ships of European build, and he had no difficulty in finding a purchaser, a speculator who drove a hard bargain, but paid cash down for the Fair Maid, with a view to a profitable resale.Thus it came about that Captain Whalley found himself on a certain afternoon descending the steps of one of the most important post-offices of the East with a slip of bluish paper in his hand.This was the receipt of a registered letter enclosing a draft for two hundred pounds, and addressed to Melbourne.Captain Whalley pushed the paper into his waistcoat-pocket, took his stick from under his arm, and walked down the street."
"这是一条新近开通的、不整洁的大路，两边的人行道还没有完全修好，整个路面上覆盖着一层柔软的灰尘。大路的一端跟海港附近那条开满中国店铺的贫民街相连；另一端一直向前伸展开去，大约有几英里，两边没有房子，穿过一片片丛林似的植物，延伸到新开的统一造船公司院门口。一幢幢新建的门面简陋的政府建筑被围着空地的毛坯围墙隔开，空旷的天空似乎使这片辽阔的景色显得格外宽敞。上班时间一过，这里就变得空荡荡的，当地人不来这里，好像他们预料会看见一只老虎从小山上新自来水厂附近大摇大摆地跑下来，跑到路中央，逮住一个开铺子的中国掌柜作为它的晚餐。惠利船长走在这条规模宏伟但是荒僻的大路上，并不显得落魄。他风度很好，不至于落到那种地步。他不过是一个孤独的、意志坚定的赶路人罢了，留着朝圣者那样的雪白的大胡子，手里那根粗大的手杖像一件武器一样。路的一边是新法院的一个低矮而朴素的门廊，有着一根根粗矮的柱子，一半隐藏在门口留下的几棵老树后面。另一边是新殖民地财政部的两侧突出的房子，一直延伸到了街道旁边。惠利船长现在既没有船，也没有家，他一边走，一边记起了第一次离开英国来到这里的时候，这里有一座渔村，几间盖在木桩上的草房，一边是一条浑浊的随潮水涨落的溪流，另一边则是一条泥泞的小路，这条路弯弯曲曲地通往一片杂乱的荒地，那里既没有码头，也没有自来水厂。","It was a recently opened and untidy thoroughfare with rudimentary side-walks and a soft layer of dust cushioning the whole width of the road.One end touched the slummy street of Chinese shops near the harbor, the other drove straight on, without houses, for a couple of miles, through patches of jungle-like vegetation, to the yard gates of the new Consolidated Docks Company.The crude frontages of the new Government buildings alternated with the blank fencing of vacant plots, and the view of the sky seemed to give an added spaciousness to the broad vista.It was empty and shunned by natives after business hours, as though they had expected to see one of the tigers from the neighborhood of the New Waterworks on the hill coming at a loping canter down the middle to get a Chinese shopkeeper for supper.Captain Whalley was not dwarfed by the solitude of the grandly planned street.He had too fine a presence for that.He was only a lonely figure walking purposefully, with a great white beard like a pilgrim, and with a thick stick that resembled a weapon.On one side the new Courts of Justice had a low and unadorned portico of squat columns half concealed by a few old trees left in the approach.On the other the pavilion wings of the new Colonial Treasury came out to the line of the street.But Captain Whalley, who had now no ship and no home, remembered in passing that on that very site when he first came out from England there had stood a fishing village, a few mat huts erected on piles between a muddy tidal creek and a miry pathway that went writhing into a tangled wilderness without any docks or waterworks."
" 没有船——没有家。他可怜的艾薇在那个遥远的地方也没有家。膳宿公寓在某种程度上算不上家，尽管它可以让你维持生活。他对膳宿公寓这个念头感到非常的恼怒。他的社会地位使其有一种真正的贵族气质，特征就是他鄙视假模假样的彬彬有礼，而且对某些贬低身份的职业怀有偏见。就他自己而言，他宁愿驾驶商船（这是一个正直的职业），而不愿买卖货物，做买卖本质上就是占别人的便宜——充其量是不光彩地运用才智而已。他的父亲过去是为东印度公司服务的退休上校惠利。他除了退休金以外，家产微薄，但是有显赫的亲友。他记得在他小的时候，那位老军人仅凭借其外表，便能让小酒馆的服务生、乡下的店主以及诸如此类的小人物尊称他为“阁下”。 ","No ship—no home.And his poor Ivy away there had no home either.A boarding-house is no sort of home though it may get you a living.His feelings were horribly rasped by the idea of the boarding-house.In his rank of life he had that truly aristocratic temperament characterized by a scorn of vulgar gentility and by prejudiced views as to the derogatory nature of certain occupations.For his own part he had always preferred sailing merchant ships (which is a straightforward occupation) to buying and selling merchandise, of which the essence is to get the better of somebody in a bargain—an undignified trial of wits at best.His father had been Colonel Whalley (retired) of the H. E. I.Company’s service, with very slender means besides his pension, but with distinguished connections.He could remember as a boy how frequently waiters at the inns, country tradesmen and small people of that sort, used to “My lord” the old warrior on the strength of his appearance."
"惠利船长本人（如果他的父亲不在自己不满十四岁就去世的话，自己就能进海军了）也显得很气派，一副年老而光荣的上将派头；可是当他走进这条街上满是棕色皮肤和黄色皮肤的人群中的时候，就像一根稻草那样消失在了小溪的漩涡里。这条街跟他刚才离开的那条广阔而空荡荡的大路比起来，似乎和胡同一样窄，而且熙熙攘攘。房子的墙壁是蓝色的；中国佬开的那些店铺犹如巢穴一般大张着嘴；大量叫不出名字的商品堆满了拱廊边长长的阴影；天空中残阳如火，仿佛火焰的反射似的阳光照在整条街道的中央。阳光照在色彩鲜艳的货物和赤脚人群深色的脸上，照在你推我挤、身子半裸的苦力们那淡黄色的脊背上；照在警察局门口站岗的一个高个子锡克族骑警的制服上，他长着分开的络腮胡和浓密的八字胡。在红色尘烟中的人头上面，隐约可见一辆很大的电车，车厢里挤满了人；电车小心翼翼的在人流中穿行，不停地鸣喇叭，好像一艘轮船在浓雾中摸索。","Captain Whalley himself (he would have entered the Navy if his father had not died before he was fourteen) had something of a grand air which would have suited an old and glorious admiral; but he became lost like a straw in the eddy of a brook amongst the swarm of brown and yellow humanity filling a thoroughfare, that by contrast with the vast and empty avenue he had left seemed as narrow as a lane and absolutely riotous with life.The walls of the houses were blue; the shops of the Chinamen yawned like cavernous lairs; heaps of nondescript merchandise overflowed the gloom of the long range of arcades, and the fiery serenity of sunset took the middle of the street from end to end with a glow like the reflection of a fire.It fell on the bright colors and the dark faces of the bare-footed crowd, on the pallid yellow backs of the half-naked jostling coolies, on the accouterments of a tall Sikh trooper with a parted beard and fierce mustaches on sentry before the gate of the police compound.Looming very big above the heads in a red haze of dust, the tightly packed car of the cable tramway navigated cautiously up the human stream, with the incessant blare of its horn, in the manner of a steamer groping in a fog."
"惠利船长像个潜水员一样从街对面出现；在关着的仓库的墙壁之间那荒凉的阴影里，他脱下了帽子，让额头凉快凉快。人们说起膳宿公寓的女房东时，总会与一种坏名声联系起来。据说这些女房东贪得无厌，肆无忌惮，不诚实；尽管他没有蔑视哪一类人的意思——上帝作证！——可是一个惠利家的人怎么能落这么个嫌疑呢！然而他没有劝她。他深信她跟他想法一致；他为她感到难过；他信任她的判断；他认为能再一次帮助她是仁慈的天命——但是在他贵族般的内心深处，他发现如果她去做女裁缝的话，他会更容易感到安心。他模模糊糊地记起多年前曾听过一首动人的曲子，名叫《衬衫之歌》。用穷苦的女人作题材写歌倒是不错。惠利上校的孙女，膳宿公寓的女房东！呸！他重新戴上帽子，双手伸进衣袋，稍停片刻，擦着一根火柴，点燃了一支廉价的方头雪茄烟，向这个飞来横祸的世界喷了一口愤怒的烟云。 ","Captain Whalley emerged like a diver on the other side, and in the desert shade between the walls of closed warehouses removed his hat to cool his brow.A certain disrepute attached to the calling of a landlady of a boarding-house.These women were said to be rapacious, unscrupulous, untruthful; and though he contemned no class of his fellow-creatures—God forbid!—these were suspicions to which it was unseemly that a Whalley should lay herself open.He had not expostulated with her, however.He was confident she shared his feelings; he was sorry for her; he trusted her judgment; he considered it a merciful dispensation that he could help her once more,—but in his aristocratic heart of hearts he would have found it more easy to reconcile himself to the idea of her turning seamstress.Vaguely he remembered reading years ago a touching piece called the “Song of the Shirt.” It was all very well making songs about poor women.The granddaughter of Colonel Whalley, the landlady of a boarding-house!Pooh!He replaced his hat, dived into two pockets, and stopping a moment to apply a flaring match to the end of a cheap cheroot, blew an embittered cloud of smoke at a world that could hold such surprises."
"有一件事情他是确信的——她是一个聪明的妈妈的亲生女儿。他已经从放弃那艘船的痛苦中恢复过来，清楚地认识到走这一步是不可避免的。也许他渐渐意识到了这种情况，只是始终不敢承认。但是她在那个遥远的地方，一定对这一切有一种直觉，而且还有面对事实的勇气和吐露真情的胆量——这些品质使她的妈妈成为一个拥有非凡智慧的女人。 ","Of one thing he was certain—that she was the own child of a clever mother.Now he had got over the wrench of parting with his ship, he perceived clearly that such a step had been unavoidable.Perhaps he had been growing aware of it all along with an unconfessed knowledge.But she, far away there, must have had an intuitive perception of it, with the pluck to face that truth and the courage to speak out—all the qualities which had made her mother a woman of such excellent counsel."
" 终归是那样的结果！幸亏她逼得他这样做。再过一两年卖的话，那艘船会变得一钱不值。为了维持船的航行，他一年一年越陷越深。对于暗处的不幸，他毫无防备；而对于那些明处的攻击，他倒能坚强地面对，像一片礁石那样，可以毫不动摇地经受着海洋明处的不断击打，而对侵蚀它根基的那些阴险的回流，它因为生性高尚，竟然一无所知。事实上，每个责任都尽到了，她的要求满足了，不欠别人一分钱，卖船的钱还剩下五百镑；他把这笔钱安全地放好。此外，他身上还带着四十多美元——足够付旅馆的账单了，如果他不在那间用来避难的简陋的卧室里住太久的话。","It would have had to come to that in the end!It was fortunate she had forced his hand.In another year or two it would have been an utterly barren sale.To keep the ship going he had been involving himself deeper every year.He was defenseless before the insidious work of adversity, to whose more open assaults he could present a firm front; like a cliff that stands unmoved the open battering of the sea, with a lofty ignorance of the treacherous backwash undermining its base.As it was, every liability satisfied, her request answered, and owing no man a penny, there remained to him from the proceeds a sum of five hundred pounds put away safely.In addition he had upon his person some forty odd dollars—enough to pay his hotel bill, providing he did not linger too long in the modest bedroom where he had taken refuge."
"那个房间家具不多，地板是打蜡的，门打开后通向一个阳台。那幢松松垮垮的砖房像鸟笼一样通风；从海滨区刷白的方柱子之间吹来的风，使那些藤帘子不断地啪啪作响。房间很高，一道闪烁不定的阳光在天花板上移动；游客们定期从海港里的一艘艘客轮上下来，闯进旅馆，在被风吹得摇曳不定的暮色笼罩下的公寓里掠过；他们陌生的声音和暂时的停留使旅馆显得吵吵闹闹；他们好像是一批又一批不得不在这个世界上匆匆忙忙奔波、却不留下一丝痕迹的幽灵。他们乱哄哄的闯入好像潮水的涨落那样，来得突然去得也突然：刚才他们还在通风的走廊里匆匆忙忙地观光，倒在阳台的长椅上休息，现在却不见了；在每一批无忧无虑、来去匆匆的游客离开之后，在这幢巨大的旅馆里几乎总是只留下惠利船长一个人，他孤单而体面，却越来越觉得自己像一个没有目的、身陷困境的游子，像一个无家可归的、被遗弃的旅客。他孤独地一个人呆在房间里，一边抽烟，一边思索，凝视着两个海员贮物箱，在这个世界上，只有这两个箱子里的东西他能说是自己的。厚厚一卷航海图套在帆布套里，靠在墙角；那个装着肖像油画和三张碳纸照片的扁包装箱放在床底下。他对讨价还价、协助调查、以及所有买卖例行手续都感到厌烦。对其他各方来说，这仅仅是出售一艘船罢了；可对他而言，这是个牵涉到一种崭新生活观念的重大事件。他知道卖掉这艘船以后就不会再有船了；但是他年少时的憧憬，他才能的发挥，他成年时的感情和成就都不可分割地跟船联系在一起。他在船上服务过；他有过船；甚至他真正从海上退休的这么多年来，只要想到一伸手就能掏出大把的钱来买一艘船，他就觉得日子过得不怎么难受了。他一直自由地想象，仿佛他就是世界上所有船只的主人似的。卖掉这艘船并不是一件轻松的事情；可是当这艘船终于还是离开他的时候，当他签了最后的收据以后，好像所有的船都从世界上一起消失了，他被撇在陆地上，手里拿着七百镑，面对着难以接近的海洋。","Scantily furnished, and with a waxed floor, it opened into one of the side-verandas.The straggling building of bricks, as airy as a bird-cage, resounded with the incessant flapping of rattan screens worried by the wind between the white-washed square pillars of the sea-front.The rooms were lofty, a ripple of sunshine flowed over the ceilings; and the periodical invasions of tourists from some passenger steamer in the harbor flitted through the wind-swept dusk of the apartments with the tumult of their unfamiliar voices and impermanent presences, like relays of migratory shades condemned to speed headlong round the earth without leaving a trace.The babble of their irruptions ebbed out as suddenly as it had arisen; the draughty corridors and the long chairs of the verandas knew their sight-seeing hurry or their prostrate repose no more; and Captain Whalley, substantial and dignified, left well-nigh alone in the vast hotel by each light-hearted skurry, felt more and more like a stranded tourist with no aim in view, like a forlorn traveler without a home.In the solitude of his room he smoked thoughtfully, gazing at the two sea-chests which held all that he could call his own in this world.A thick roll of charts in a sheath of sailcloth leaned in a corner; the flat packing-case containing the portrait in oils and the three carbon photographs had been pushed under the bed.He was tired of discussing terms, of assisting at surveys, of all the routine of the business.What to the other parties was merely the sale of a ship was to him a momentous event involving a radically new view of existence.He knew that after this ship there would be no other; and the hopes of his youth, the exercise of his abilities, every feeling and achievement of his manhood, had been indissolubly connected with ships.He had served ships; he had owned ships; and even the years of his actual retirement from the sea had been made bearable by the idea that he had only to stretch out his hand full of money to get a ship.He had been at liberty to feel as though he were the owner of all the ships in the world.The selling of this one was weary work; but when she passed from him at last, when he signed the last receipt, it was as though all the ships had gone out of the world together, leaving him on the shore of inaccessible oceans with seven hundred pounds in his hands."
"惠利船长坚定地迈着大步，不慌不忙地顺着码头走去，眼光避开熟悉的锚地。自从他第一次航海以来，已经有两代海员出世了，他们站在他和所有这些锚地上的船之间。他自己的船卖掉了，他一直在问自己：下一步该怎样？","Striding firmly, without haste, along the quay, Captain Whalley averted his glances from the familiar roadstead.Two generations of seamen born since his first day at sea stood between him and all these ships at the anchorage.His own was sold, and he had been asking himself, What next?"
"他感到孤独，感到内心空虚，也感到怅然若失，好像他自己的灵魂被人强行从他的身子里带走一样。他首先涌出的一个愿望就是立刻动身，去和他的女儿在一起。“这是最后一笔钱了，”他会跟她说，“收下吧，亲爱的。还有你的老父亲，你也得把他收留下来。”","From the feeling of loneliness, of inward emptiness,—and of loss too, as if his very soul had been taken out of him forcibly,—there had sprung at first a desire to start right off and join his daughter.“Here are the last pence,” he would say to her; “take them, my dear.And here’s your old father: you must take him too.” "
"他的灵魂畏缩了，好像害怕在那阵冲动深处隐藏着什么似的。放弃！绝不！当一个人筋疲力尽的时候，脑子里就会出现各种各样荒谬的想法。这七百镑，还有一个很可能会活上许多年的强壮的老家伙作累赘——对一个贫穷的女人而言，这份礼物真是太好了。他不是跟那边那些掌管抛锚的船只的年轻人一样，可以死在工作岗位上吗？他现在跟过去任何时候一样结实。可是谈到谁会给他一份工作干，那就是另一回事了。凭他的外表和经历，他要是四处走走，寻找一个比较低的职位的话，他担心别人不会认真对待他；否则，他要是成功地打动了他们，使他们认真对待他，他也许会博得他们的怜悯，可这就像把你自己剥得赤裸裸的让人踢一样。他不愿意吐露真情，把自己说成一个没用的废物。他不需要任何人的怜悯。另一方面，船长的职位——考虑到体面问题，这是他唯一能谋求的职位——不可能在下一个街角等着他。如今用不着总是求别人来担任船长了。自从他上岸进行了那笔卖船的交易以来，他一直留神听着，可是没有听到一点儿风声，这个港口哪里的船长职位有空缺。就算有这样的空缺，他成功的过去却妨碍着他谋差事。他给自己当雇主太久了。他唯一能提供的证明是对自己一生的描述。谁还能要求比这更好的推荐呢？但是他隐隐约约觉得，这份独一无二的证明会被看作一件关于东方海域的陈旧的老古董，一篇用老式的文字、用几乎已经被遗忘的语言描写的冗长的文章。","His soul recoiled, as if afraid of what lay hidden at the bottom of this impulse.Give up!Never!When one is thoroughly weary all sorts of nonsense come into one’s head.A pretty gift it would have been for a poor woman—this seven hundred pounds with the incumbrance of a hale old fellow more than likely to last for years and years to come.Was he not as fit to die in harness as any of the youngsters in charge of these anchored ships out yonder?He was as solid now as ever he had been.But as to who would give him work to do, that was another matter.Were he, with his appearance and antecedents, to go about looking for a junior’s berth, people, he was afraid, would not take him seriously; or else if he succeeded in impressing them, he would maybe obtain their pity, which would be like stripping yourself naked to be kicked.He was not anxious to give himself away for less than nothing.He had no use for anybody’s pity.On the other hand, a command—the only thing he could try for with due regard for common decency—was not likely to be lying in wait for him at the corner of the next street.Commands don’t go a-begging nowadays.Ever since he had come ashore to carry out the business of the sale he had kept his ears open, but had heard no hint of one being vacant in the port.And even if there had been one, his successful past itself stood in his way.He had been his own employer too long.The only credential he could produce was the testimony of his whole life.What better recommendation could anyone require?But vaguely he felt that the unique document would be looked upon as an archaic curiosity of the Eastern waters, a screed traced in obsolete words—in a half-forgotten language."
"第四章","IV "
"他一边反复地想着，一边在码头的栏杆附近散步，挺着胸膛，一点没有弯腰屈背的模样，仿佛他宽阔的肩膀从未感觉到从生到死必须承担的那些负担的责任似的。没有一条忧虑的皱纹泄露他的心情，破坏他平静的面貌。那张脸长得挺饱满，也没有被晒黑；下垂而飘逸的银发下面现出了脸的上部，神情非常平静，白净的皮肤细腻得引人注目，额头很宽阔。他第一次投射在你身上的目光又坦率又敏捷，像一个孩子那样；但是由于雪白的眉毛杂乱而浓密，他和蔼可亲的注视变得深沉，像是透彻的审视。随着年龄的增长，他有点发胖，腰围变粗了，像一棵丝毫没有衰亡迹象的老树；甚至他胸脯上浓密的、有光泽的、鬈曲的毛发看起来也显示出不可遏制的生气和活力。","Revolving these thoughts, he strolled on near the railings of the quay, broad-chested, without a stoop, as though his big shoulders had never felt the burden of the loads that must be carried between the cradle and the grave.No single betraying fold or line of care disfigured the reposeful modeling of his face.It was full and untanned; and the upper part emerged, massively quiet, out of the downward flow of silvery hair, with the striking delicacy of its clear complexion and the powerful width of the forehead.The first cast of his glance fell on you candid and swift, like a boy’s; but because of the ragged snowy thatch of the eyebrows the affability of his attention acquired the character of a dark and searching scrutiny.With age he had put on flesh a little, had increased his girth like an old tree presenting no symptoms of decay; and even the opulent, lustrous ripple of white hairs upon his chest seemed an attribute of unquenchable vitality and vigor."
"他曾经对自己过人的体力，甚至对自己的仪表，感到相当骄傲，也意识到自己的价值，对正直的品质坚定不移；作为成功逝去之后留下的遗产，他还保持着平静的神情，这种神情证明了他是一个能适应自己选择的各种生活方式的人。他笔直地大步向前走去，头上戴着一顶帽边突出的老式巴拿马草帽。帽顶很低，帽子周围是一圈折痕，围着一条窄窄的黑色绸带。这顶戴不坏的、有点褪色的帽子，使他在拥挤的码头上和热闹的街道上老远就很容易被认出。他从未戴过样式比较现代的、用管土涂白的软木遮阳帽。他不喜欢那种样式；他希望自己能设法在生前保持冷静的头脑，不去尝试所有这些卫生的通风装备。他的头发剪得很短，他的亚麻布衬衫总是白白净净，一尘不染；一身灰色的薄法兰绒衣服，穿得绒毛已经被磨掉了，但是仔细地刷过，这件衣服由于剪裁宽松，在他结实的四肢上飘动，使他魁梧的身体看起来格外高大。他壮年的时候乐观，沉着冷静，敢作敢为；多年的经历使他的性情渐渐变成了满不在乎的平静；他那一头包着铁的手杖发出的悠闲的嗒嗒声，跟他踩在石板上发出的自信的脚步声彼此呼应。人们不可能把这样出色的风度，这样镇定的面貌跟让人轻视的贫困的苦恼联系起来；这样一个人在你面前走过，温和而魁梧，看上去好像他的财产跟他身上的衣服一样大，过的是自由自在的生活。","Once rather proud of his great bodily strength, and even of his personal appearance, conscious of his worth, and firm in his rectitude, there had remained to him, like the heritage of departed prosperity, the tranquil bearing of a man who had proved himself fit in every sort of way for the life of his choice.He strode on squarely under the projecting brim of an ancient Panama hat.It had a low crown, a crease through its whole diameter, a narrow black ribbon.Imperishable and a little discolored, this headgear made it easy to pick him out from afar on thronged wharves and in the busy streets.He had never adopted the comparatively modern fashion of pipeclayed cork helmets.He disliked the form; and he hoped he could manage to keep a cool head to the end of his life without all these contrivances for hygienic ventilation.His hair was cropped close, his linen always of immaculate whiteness; a suit of thin gray flannel, worn threadbare but scrupulously brushed, floated about his burly limbs, adding to his bulk by the looseness of its cut.The years had mellowed the good-humored, imperturbable audacity of his prime into a temper carelessly serene; and the leisurely tapping of his iron-shod stick accompanied his footfalls with a self-confident sound on the flagstones.It was impossible to connect such a fine presence and this unruffled aspect with the belittling troubles of poverty; the man’s whole existence appeared to pass before you, facile and large, in the freedom of means as ample as the clothing of his body."
"他不合常理地害怕，害怕不得不动用他的五百镑来支付旅馆里的费用，这干扰了他心情的镇静。没有时间再浪费了。账单不断地增加。他怀着这样的希望，如果其他的方法都落空了，这五百镑也许会使他得到一个工作；得到这个工作，他就能勉强糊口（这不需要很大的费用），这样以来就能使他对自己的女儿还有点用。依他看来，他用的是女儿的钱，好像做女儿的把钱给父亲用，只是为了她自己的利益。一旦他有了工作，就会拿大部分收入帮助她；他还可以干上好多年呢，而开办膳宿公寓，他跟自己争辩说，不管前景怎么样，刚开始的时候是挣不了什么钱的。可是，干什么活呢？他随时准备用正当的手段抓住任何机会，这样他才能尽快找到工作；因为那五百镑必须原封不动地保存着，以备万一。这才是最重要的。只要有五百镑这个整数，人就感到有了财产作为靠山，但是在他看来，要是让这笔钱减少到四百五十镑，甚至四百八十镑的话，这笔钱的效力就消失了，好像有什么魔力在那个整数中似的。可是，干什么活呢？","The irrational dread of having to break into his five hundred pounds for personal expenses in the hotel disturbed the steady poise of his mind.There was no time to lose.The bill was running up.He nourished the hope that this five hundred would perhaps be the means, if everything else failed, of obtaining some work which, keeping his body and soul together (not a matter of great outlay), would enable him to be of use to his daughter.To his mind it was her own money which he employed, as it were, in backing her father and solely for her benefit.Once at work, he would help her with the greater part of his earnings; he was good for many years yet, and this boarding-house business, he argued to himself, whatever the prospects, could not be much of a gold-mine from the first start.But what work?He was ready to lay hold of anything in an honest way so that it came quickly to his hand; because the five hundred pounds must be preserved intact for eventual use.That was the great point.With the entire five hundred one felt a substance at one’s back; but it seemed to him that should he let it dwindle to four-fifty or even four-eighty, all the efficiency would be gone out of the money, as though there were some magic power in the round figure.But what sort of work?"
"这个问题像纠缠不清的幽灵一样总是萦绕在他心中，而他却没有撵走这个幽灵的符咒；惠利船长在一座小桥的顶上突然站住脚，那座桥险峻地架在一条开成运河的小溪的河床上，两岸都是花岗石。在方形石块砌成的两岸之间，停泊着一艘远洋航行的马来亚快速帆船，船半藏在石头的拱顶下面，微微浮动，帆横杆都平放着，甲板上没有一点人声，从船头到船尾覆盖着用棕榈叶席子搭建的一个脊状的船舱。他已经把那些热得让人难以忍受的人行道抛在了身后，那些人行道顺着弯弯曲曲的码头延伸出去，两边是像悬崖的正面那样陡峭的石壁；而他前面呈现出一片无比辽阔的景象，井井有条、树木森森；一片片随风起伏的草地像一张张平坦的绿地毯；一长溜大树整齐地排列着，像一根根巨大的柱子，黑糊糊的树干上方，覆盖着穹顶一般的枝叶。","Confronted by that haunting question as by an uneasy ghost, for whom he had no exorcising formula, Captain Whalley stopped short on the apex of a small bridge spanning steeply the bed of a canalized creek with granite shores.Moored between the square blocks a seagoing Malay prau floated half hidden under the arch of masonry, with her spars lowered down, without a sound of life on board, and covered from stem to stern with a ridge of palm-leaf mats.He had left behind him the overheated pavements bordered by the stone frontages that, like the sheer face of cliffs, followed the sweep of the quays; and an unconfined spaciousness of orderly and sylvan aspect opened before him its wide plots of rolled grass, like pieces of green carpet smoothly pegged out, its long ranges of trees lined up in colossal porticos of dark shafts roofed with a vault of branches."
"几条大街一直通到海边。那里的海岸是个阶梯状的平台；海岸外，平静辽阔的海面深邃而微微闪光，犹如深蓝的眼睛的凝视；海面上一道歪歪斜斜的紫色光带无限地延伸开去，穿过两个形状相似的翠绿的小岛之间的空隙。远处的锚地上，原来只能隐约看见几艘船的桅杆和帆横杆，这时它们突然像一片纵横交错的、纤细的玫瑰色光线跃出船舷东边的水面，印在清晰的阴影上空。惠利船长看了那些船很久。那艘从前属于他的船停泊在那里。他一想到在傍晚来临的时候，他再也不能在防堤旁乘坐一艘小船，摆渡到自己那艘三桅帆船上去，心里就难过得要命。没有船可以去。也许永远都没有了。在卖船那笔交易谈妥以前，直到他收入船款为止，他天天在美人号上待上一段时间。就在今天早晨，他收了钱，可是现在，突然地，哪怕他想到船上去，也根本没有这样一艘船了；再也没有一艘船的生存会需要他的存在。这简直是一件不可思议的事情，这种事情太奇怪了，不会长久的。而海面上却停满了各式各样的船只。那艘马来亚快速帆船一动不动地停着，整个甲板上笼罩着棕榈叶缝制的船舱——它也有个不可缺少的人。人和船相依为命；这个马来亚人他从未见过；那艘船尾很高、小的可怜的船，好像是经历了长途跋涉以后在休息。所有看得见的船上，无论远近，都有一个人；没有那个人，最好的船也只毫无生命的东西，是漂浮的，没有意志的木头。","Some of these avenues ended at the sea.It was a terraced shore; and beyond, upon the level expanse, profound and glistening like the gaze of a dark-blue eye, an oblique band of stippled purple lengthened itself indefinitely through the gap between a couple of verdant twin islets.The masts and spars of a few ships far away, hull down in the outer roads, sprang straight from the water in a fine maze of rosy lines penciled on the clear shadow of the eastern board.Captain Whalley gave them a long glance.The ship, once his own, was anchored out there.It was staggering to think that it was open to him no longer to take a boat at the jetty and get himself pulled off to her when the evening came.To no ship.Perhaps never more.Before the sale was concluded, and till the purchase-money had been paid, he had spent daily some time on board the Fair Maid.The money had been paid this very morning, and now, all at once, there was positively no ship that he could go on board of when he liked; no ship that would need his presence in order to do her work—to live.It seemed an incredible state of affairs, something too bizarre to last.And the sea was full of craft of all sorts.There was that prau lying so still swathed in her shroud of sewn palm-leaves—she too had her indispensable man.They lived through each other, this Malay he had never seen, and this high-sterned thing of no size that seemed to be resting after a long journey.And of all the ships in sight, near and far, each was provided with a man, the man without whom the finest ship is a dead thing, a floating and purposeless log."
"他向锚地看了一眼后，继续向前走去，因为没有什么值得他往回走；而且不管怎么样，时间总得挨过去。海滨的空地上有一条条林荫大道，从不同的角度纵横交织着；那些大树的下部犹如圆柱一般，树顶上枝繁叶茂。那些高高在上的交错的树枝似乎在睡觉，头顶上没有一片树叶有动静；路中央，一根根细长的铸铁的路灯柱象君王的权杖那样闪着金光，顶上都有一个白瓷的球形灯罩，这种野蛮的装饰像一排正在展览的鸵鸟蛋，放眼望去，那些灯罩越远越小。火红的天空在每一个蛋壳似的瓷灯罩的闪闪发亮的表面，都点燃了一朵微小的深红的火花。","After his one glance at the roadstead he went on, since there was nothing to turn back for, and the time must be got through somehow.The avenues of big trees ran straight over the Esplanade, cutting each other at diverse angles, columnar below and luxuriant above.The interlaced boughs high up there seemed to slumber; not a leaf stirred overhead: and the reedy cast-iron lampposts in the middle of the road, gilt like scepters, diminished in a long perspective, with their globes of white porcelain atop, resembling a barbarous decoration of ostriches’ eggs displayed in a row.The flaming sky kindled a tiny crimson spark upon the glistening surface of each glassy shell."
"惠利船长的下巴微微搭拉下来，他背着双手，手杖头在脚跟后面的沙砾路上，画出了一道淡淡的抖动的痕迹。他反复思索着，如果说一艘船上没有一个人，就像一个躯体没有灵魂的话，那么一个水手没有一艘船，在这个世界上也就比一根漫无目的地在海上漂浮的木头好不了多少。 那根木头可能本身很好，质地结实，经久耐用——但是那又怎么样呢！突然有一阵无药可救的闲散感，就像极度疲倦那样，压得他两只脚懒得移动。","With his chin sunk a little, his hands behind his back, and the end of his stick marking the gravel with a faint wavering line at his heels, Captain Whalley reflected that if a ship without a man was like a body without a soul, a sailor without a ship was of not much more account in this world than an aimless log adrift upon the sea.The log might be sound enough by itself, tough of fiber, and hard to destroy—but what of that!And a sudden sense of irremediable idleness weighted his feet like a great fatigue."
"接连不断的敞篷马车沿着新开通的海滨大道轻快地驶去。你可以看到那些车的辐条组成的转动的圆面穿过一片片广阔的草地。一顶顶遮阳伞的拱顶轻轻地向外摇晃着，像花瓶口边上盛开的鲜花；那片安静的深蓝色的海水——海面上横着一道紫色光带——变成旋转的车轮和奔跑的马儿的背景，与此同时，那些印度仆人包着头巾的脑袋抬起来，超过了海平面，在淡蓝色的天空前迅速地划过。在那座小桥附近一片空旷的地方，每辆马车都敏捷而漂亮地绕一个大弯，驶出夕照，然后忽然慢下来，排成长长的缓缓移动的行列，驶上那条主街，背后是寂静火红的天空。一棵棵巨大的树屹立着，树干的同一面都染上了红色；在高高的树叶下，空气似乎也火一般的红；连马蹄下的地面都是红的。那些车轮庄严地滚动着；遮阳伞也一个接一个地收了起来，各种色彩都合拢了，好像灿烂的鲜花在白天将尽的时候合上了它们的花瓣。这一条人和马车组成的流水线整整有半英里长，没有人说一个字，只有微弱的碰撞声不断地和轻轻的叮当声混合在一起，一对对男女神情冷淡地坐着，比包着头巾的人高出一截，他们的脑袋和肩膀一动也不动——仿佛木头一样。但是有一辆四轮马车来迟了，没有加入这个行列。","A succession of open carriages came bowling along the newly opened sea-road.You could see across the wide grass-plots the discs of vibration made by the spokes.The bright domes of the parasols swayed lightly outwards like full-blown blossoms on the rim of a vase; and the quiet sheet of dark-blue water, crossed by a bar of purple, made a background for the spinning wheels and the high action of the horses, whilst the turbaned heads of the Indian servants elevated above the line of the sea horizon glided rapidly on the paler blue of the sky.In an open space near the little bridge each turn-out trotted smartly in a wide curve away from the sunset; then pulling up sharp, entered the main alley in a long slow-moving file with the great red stillness of the sky at the back.The trunks of mighty trees stood all touched with red on the same side, the air seemed aflame under the high foliage, the very ground under the hoofs of the horses was red.The wheels turned solemnly; one after another the sunshades drooped, folding their colors like gorgeous flowers shutting their petals at the end of the day.In the whole half-mile of human beings no voice uttered a distinct word, only a faint thudding noise went on mingled with slight jingling sounds, and the motionless heads and shoulders of men and women sitting in couples emerged stolidly above the lowered hoods—as if wooden.But one carriage and pair coming late did not join the line."
"它一路飞快地驶来，车轮无声地滚动；但是在驶上那条大街的时候，其中一匹深栗色的马打了个响鼻，弯下脖子，碰到那根钢头的辕杆惊跳起来；一口唾沫从马嚼子上流下来，落在缎子般光滑的肩头上；黑脸膛的马车夫一下子探出身去，扑到双手上，重新拉紧了缰绳。这是一辆长长的暗绿色的四轮马车，座位两侧装有弧度很大的片弹簧，所以行驶起来的时候会庄严而轻快地摆动，而且装饰极为精美，带着点官府才有的气派。这辆马车似乎比一般的马车更为宽敞，两匹马好像也稍大了一些，设备更加精美，坐在车厢上的仆人们好像也格外高一点。车上坐着三个女人：两个年轻漂亮，另一个美貌富态，是个成年妇女。她们的衣服好像完全把浅浅的车厢铺满了。第四个是男人：有着厚厚的眼睑，脸相高贵、肤色灰黄；嘴唇上下长着黑乎乎的、浓密的、铁灰色的小胡子，不知为何，看起来好像结实的附生器官。原来是总督大人。","It fled along in a noiseless roll; but on entering the avenue one of the dark bays snorted, arching his neck and shying against the steel-tipped pole; a flake of foam fell from the bit upon the point of a satiny shoulder, and the dusky face of the coachman leaned forward at once over the hands taking a fresh grip of the reins.It was a long dark-green landau, having a dignified and buoyant motion between the sharply curved C-springs, and a sort of strictly official majesty in its supreme elegance.It seemed more roomy than is usual, its horses seemed slightly bigger, the appointments a shade more perfect, the servants perched somewhat higher on the box.The dresses of three women—two young and pretty, and one, handsome, large, of mature age—seemed to fill completely the shallow body of the carriage.The fourth face was that of a man, heavy lidded, distinguished and sallow, with a somber, thick, iron-gray imperial and mustaches, which somehow had the air of solid appendages.His Excellency— "
" 这辆带有随从的马车飞快地行驶，使一切其他的马车都显得低劣、寒酸，而且相比之下，慢得如蜗牛般费力地爬行。那辆四轮马车不停地向前猛冲，把那列马车远远地甩在了后面；马车上人的容貌一眨眼就看不见了，只给人留下一个眼光凝视、神情冷漠的印象；那辆马车可以说是飞也似的没了影踪，尽管那长长一溜马车仍然拥挤地在路上行驶，这条大街原来一派宏伟的景色，似乎变得空荡荡的，一个人也没有了，给人一种放大的庄严的孤独印象。","The rapid motion of that one equipage made all the others appear utterly inferior, blighted, and reduced to crawl painfully at a snail’s pace.The landau distanced the whole file in a sort of sustained rush; the features of the occupant whirling out of sight left behind an impression of fixed stares and impassive vacancy; and after it had vanished in full flight as it were, notwithstanding the long line of vehicles hugging the curb at a walk, the whole lofty vista of the avenue seemed to lie open and emptied of life in the enlarged impression of an august solitude."
"惠利抬头看了看；他原本的思路被打断以后，莫名其妙地转到一些无关紧要的事情上去。人们的思路往往会这样突然转变。他突然想到，他刚才在这个港口卖掉了他最后一艘船，他曾驾驶着自己的第一艘船来到这里，带着他满脑子的计划，打算同这些遥远的岛屿打交道，开辟新的贸易。当时的总督曾无数次地鼓励过他。当时压根没有总督大人的尊称，他——那位德纳姆先生——那位总是不穿外套的总督；可以说，这个人日日夜夜为殖民地的日益繁荣而操劳，他那忘我的热情，好像一个保姆照顾她喜爱的孩子一样；一个孤独的单身汉带着少数几个仆人和三条狗，住在营房一般的房子里，当时叫“总督平房”；那是一幢屋顶很低的建筑，坐落在一座小山还没有完全开发好的斜坡上，前面竖着一根新旗杆，阳台上站着一个当勤务员的警察。他还记得在烈日下辛苦地登上山去拜访他的忠实听众的情景，那个阴沉沉、凉飕飕的房间里几乎没有什么家具，那张长桌子的一头摞着一大堆文件，另一头则有两把枪、一个铜望远镜、一小瓶墨水，瓶颈里插着一根羽毛，此外，他还记得那个掌握大权的人对他近乎奉承的关切。他前去陈述的是一项充满冒险性的事业，但是在小山上那幢总督平房里，仅仅二十分钟的谈话就使这件事有了一个顺利的开端。当他告别的时候，德纳姆先生已经坐在了那堆文件面前，在他背后大声说：“下个月黛多号开始去那条航线巡航，我会正式要求那艘船的船长拜访你，看你进展的如何。”黛多号是停泊在中国的一艘出色的护卫舰——三十五年是一段好长的时间啊。三十五以前，对殖民地来说，像他那样的事业已经相当重要，值得让女王的一艘船去照顾了。真是好长的一段时间啊。当时个人还比较受重视。一些像他那样的人，比如说，可怜的埃文斯。他长着一张红脸，有像煤炭一样黑的络腮胡子，和一双焦躁不安的眼睛。他在海岸上游三英里的一个偏僻海湾里，在树林边上，建立了第一个专利船坞，用来修理小船。德纳姆先生对这样的事业也进行鼓励，可是不知什么原因，可怜的埃文斯结果还是非常贫穷地死在了英国。据说，他的儿子在印度洋一个荒凉的小岛上，靠从可可豆中榨油维持生活；但是正是从那个偏僻的海湾的树林边上的船坞中，涌现出了统一造船公司的那些车间，还有从坚实的岩石中开凿出来的三个干船坞、码头、防波堤、电灯厂、蒸汽车间——还有巨大的起重机，能吊起从船上运来的最重的货物；当你从西边来到新港的时候，你能看到它的顶端像一座奇怪的白色纪念碑的顶那样，在灌木丛生的地角和尽是黄沙的海岬上空窥探。","Captain Whalley had lifted his head to look, and his mind, disturbed in its meditation, turned with wonder (as men’s minds will do) to matters of no importance.It struck him that it was to this port, where he had just sold his last ship, that he had come with the very first he had ever owned, and with his head full of a plan for opening a new trade with a distant part of the Archipelago.The then governor had given him no end of encouragement.No Excellency he—this Mr. Denham—this governor with his jacket off; a man who tended night and day, so to speak, the growing prosperity of the settlement with the self-forgetful devotion of a nurse for a child she loves; a lone bachelor who lived as in a camp with the few servants and his three dogs in what was called then the Government Bungalow: a low-roofed structure on the half-cleared slope of a hill, with a new flagstaff in front and a police orderly on the veranda.He remembered toiling up that hill under a heavy sun for his audience; the unfurnished aspect of the cool shaded room; the long table covered at one end with piles of papers, and with two guns, a brass telescope, a small bottle of oil with a feather stuck in the neck at the other—and the flattering attention given to him by the man in power.It was an undertaking full of risk he had come to expound, but a twenty minutes’ talk in the Government Bungalow on the hill had made it go smoothly from the start.And as he was retiring Mr. Denham, already seated before the papers, called out after him, “Next month the Dido starts for a cruise that way, and I shall request her captain officially to give you a look in and see how you get on.” The Dido was one of the smart frigates on the China station—and five-and-thirty years make a big slice of time.Five-and-thirty years ago an enterprise like his had for the colony enough importance to be looked after by a Queen’s ship.A big slice of time.Individuals were of some account then.Men like himself; men, too, like poor Evans, for instance, with his red face, his coal-black whiskers, and his restless eyes, who had set up the first patent slip for repairing small ships, on the edge of the forest, in a lonely bay three miles up the coast.Mr. Denham had encouraged that enterprise too, and yet somehow poor Evans had ended by dying at home deucedly hard up.His son, they said, was squeezing oil out of cocoa-nuts for a living on some God-forsaken islet of the Indian Ocean; but it was from that patent slip in a lonely wooded bay that had sprung the workshops of the Consolidated Docks Company, with its three graving basins carved out of solid rock, its wharves, its jetties, its electric-light plant, its steam-power houses—with its gigantic sheer-legs, fit to lift the heaviest weight ever carried afloat, and whose head could be seen like the top of a queer white monument peeping over bushy points of land and sandy promontories, as you approached the New Harbor from the west."
"人们在那个时候受到重视，而且当时殖民地上还没有那么多的马车，而他猜想德纳姆先生可能有一辆轻便马车。惠利船长好像被精神回流中的漩涡从那条大街上卷出去了。他记起了那些泥泞的海岸，一个没有码头的港口，唯一的木码头（那可是个公共建筑）孤零零地、歪歪斜斜地向外突出着，建在猴岬上的第一个煤栈，那个煤栈莫名其妙地着了火，闷烧了好几天。结果，那些颇为吃惊的船只都驶进充满硫磺味的烟雾弥漫的锚地；而天空中的太阳在正午也是血红的。他记起了一些事、一些人的脸，除此以外，还有一些东西——像喝光了酒的酒杯里淡淡的酒香，像在今天的空气里找不到的一丝微风。 ","There had been a time when men counted: there were not so many carriages in the colony then, though Mr. Denham, he fancied, had a buggy.And Captain Whalley seemed to be swept out of the great avenue by the swirl of a mental backwash.He remembered muddy shores, a harbor without quays, the one solitary wooden pier (but that was a public work) jutting out crookedly, the first coal-sheds erected on Monkey Point, that caught fire mysteriously and smoldered for days, so that amazed ships came into a roadstead full of sulphurous smoke, and the sun hung blood-red at midday.He remembered the things, the faces, and something more besides—like the faint flavor of a cup quaffed to the bottom, like a subtle sparkle of the air that was not to be found in the atmosphere of to-day."
"往事在惠利船长的心头被唤起，迅速而详细，好像一道镁光照进了一座黑暗的纪念堂中的壁龛；他思索着一些曾经是很重要的事情，小人物的努力啊，一个伟大的地方的成长啊，可是现在，同已经取得的伟大成就相比，同更伟大的希望相比，那些事情的重要性就化为乌有了；这使他切身地体会到了时光的流逝，使他理解了我们那不变的感情。他突然站住脚，用手杖砰地一声敲向地面，在心里呐喊：“我究竟在这里干什么！”他似乎在这种惊奇中迷失了自我，但是他听到有人在用气喘吁吁的声音叫他的名字，一次，两次——然后他慢腾腾地转过身去。","In this evocation, swift and full of detail like a flash of magnesium light into the niches of a dark memorial hall, Captain Whalley contemplated things once important, the efforts of small men, the growth of a great place, but now robbed of all consequence by the greatness of accomplished facts, by hopes greater still; and they gave him for a moment such an almost physical grip upon time, such a comprehension of our unchangeable feelings, that he stopped short, struck the ground with his stick, and ejaculated mentally, “What the devil am I doing here!” He seemed lost in a sort of surprise; but he heard his name called out in wheezy tones once, twice—and turned on his heels slowly."
"于是他看见有个人神气活现、大摇大摆地向他走来，一个像害痛风病模样的老派人，头发和他自己的一样白，可是红润的脸颊上胡子刮得精光，那个人系着一个领结——几乎是个围巾——领结的坚硬的两头翘的比他的下巴还高；滚圆的大腿、滚圆的胳膊、滚圆的脸通常给人这样的印象，好像他矮胖的身子是用打气筒打了气似的，打的气正好使他衣服的线缝不致绽开。他是这个海港的港务监督。港务监督在港务长中地位最高；远在东方，在他的管辖范围内，算是个相当重要的人；他是个政府官员，一个管理港口海域的行政官员，对各级海员都有着巨大而界限不清的惩戒权力。据说就是这位港务监督，认为他的职位小得可怜，理由是他没有权力决定人的生死。当然这只是一句开玩笑的夸张话。埃利奥特船长对他的职位是相当满意的，对他拥有的这个权力并没有无足轻重的感觉。他自以为是、专横跋扈的性格决不会让他手中的职权因为不用而缩小。他总是嚷嚷咧咧、暴躁而口无遮拦地批评别人的性格和行为，使别人从心底里怕他——尽管在谈话中很多人假装对他毫不在乎，另一些人在提到他的名字的时候只是冷笑一下，甚至有些人还敢说他是“一个爱管闲事的老无赖”。但是只要埃利奥特一发脾气，几乎所有人都会像面对被歼灭的可能那样垂头丧气。","He beheld then, waddling towards him autocratically, a man of an old-fashioned and gouty aspect, with hair as white as his own, but with shaved, florid cheeks, wearing a necktie—almost a neckcloth—whose stiff ends projected far beyond his chin; with round legs, round arms, a round body, a round face—generally producing the effect of his short figure having been distended by means of an air-pump as much as the seams of his clothing would stand.This was the Master-Attendant of the port.A master-attendant is a superior sort of harbor-master; a person, out in the East, of some consequence in his sphere; a Government official, a magistrate for the waters of the port, and possessed of vast but ill-defined disciplinary authority over seamen of all classes.This particular Master-Attendant was reported to consider it miserably inadequate, on the ground that it did not include the power of life and death.This was a jocular exaggeration.Captain Eliott was fairly satisfied with his position, and nursed no inconsiderable sense of such power as he had.His conceited and tyrannical disposition did not allow him to let it dwindle in his hands for want of use.The uproarious, choleric frankness of his comments on people’s character and conduct caused him to be feared at bottom; though in conversation many pretended not to mind him in the least, others would only smile sourly at the mention of his name, and there were even some who dared to pronounce him “a meddlesome old ruffian.” But for almost all of them one of Captain Eliott’s outbreaks was nearly as distasteful to face as a chance of annihilation."
"第五章","V "
"一等他走近，他就咆哮般地喊道：“我听说的是真的吗，惠利？你真的把美人号卖掉了？”","As soon as he had come up quite close he said, mouthing in a growl— “What’s this I hear, Whalley?Is it true you’re selling the Fair Maid?” "
"惠利船长望向别处，说事情已经办妥——那天早晨钱已经付清了；对方立刻对这个非常理智的举动表示了赞许。他解释说，他正在回家吃饭的路上，从双轮轻便马车上下来，是要伸展一下腿。弗雷德里克爵士在晚年看上去身体不错。对不对？","Captain Whalley, looking away, said the thing was done—money had been paid that morning; and the other expressed at once his approbation of such an extremely sensible proceeding.He had got out of his trap to stretch his legs, he explained, on his way home to dinner.Sir Frederick looked well at the end of his time.Didn’t he?"
"惠利船长没法回答他，他只是看到马车驶过而已。","Captain Whalley could not say; had only noticed the carriage going past."
"那个港务监督把他的双手插进羊驼毛短上衣的口袋里，这件衣服对他那样的年纪和外貌来说又短又紧，很不合适。他一瘸一拐、大摇大摆地走着，他的头只到惠利船长的肩膀处。而惠利船长呢，从容不迫地走着，眼光笔直地盯着前面。多年以前，他们是好伙伴，几乎是亲密的朋友。当惠利指挥著名的神鹰号时，埃利奥特掌管着几乎同样大名鼎鼎的斑鸠号（跟神鹰号是同样的船主）；在设置港务监督这个职位的时候，惠利本来会成为除了埃利奥特以外唯一一个有希望的候选人。但是惠利船长那时正值壮年，下定决心不为别人，只为他自己的好运气服务。身在远方的惠利，处理着他自己的事务，同时为另一个人成功的消息而欣喜。内德·埃利奥特性格直率，但是懂得圆滑处事，对他担任那种公职倒是很有用。他们两人实际上截然不同，他们一路慢腾腾地走到了大街尽头的大教堂前面，但是惠利从来没有想到过，他原来有可能担任这个人的职位——一辈子有吃有穿。","The Master-Attendant, plunging his hands into the pockets of an alpaca jacket inappropriately short and tight for a man of his age and appearance, strutted with a slight limp, and with his head reaching only to the shoulder of Captain Whalley, who walked easily, staring straight before him.They had been good comrades years ago, almost intimates.At the time when Whalley commanded the renowned Condor, Eliott had charge of the nearly as famous Ringdove for the same owners; and when the appointment of Master-Attendant was created, Whalley would have been the only other serious candidate.But Captain Whalley, then in the prime of life, was resolved to serve no one but his own auspicious Fortune.Far away, tending his hot irons, he was glad to hear the other had been successful.There was a worldly suppleness in bluff Ned Eliott that would serve him well in that sort of official appointment.And they were so dissimilar at bottom that as they came slowly to the end of the avenue before the Cathedral, it had never come into Whalley’s head that he might have been in that man’s place—provided for to the end of his days."
"这座神圣的建筑是许多林荫大道的汇合点，庄严而孤独地矗立着，好像为了要使人们在悠闲的时刻想到严肃的天国一样，向西方天空中绚烂的夕照展示着一个关闭着的哥特式入口。在一个很深的石轮雕刻中，尖形拱顶上面，圆花窗的玻璃像燃烧着的煤那样闪闪发亮。两个人转过身来。","The sacred edifice, standing in solemn isolation amongst the converging avenues of enormous trees, as if to put grave thoughts of heaven into the hours of ease, presented a closed Gothic portal to the light and glory of the west.The glass of the rosace above the ogive glowed like fiery coal in the deep carvings of a wheel of stone.The two men faced about."
"“让我告诉你，他们接下来应该做什么，惠利。”埃利奥特突然吼道。","“I’ll tell you what they ought to do next, Whalley,” growled Captain Eliott suddenly."
"“嗯？”","“Well?” "
"“弗雷德里克爵士任期一满，他们就应该派一个真正的勋爵来这里。是不是？”","“They ought to send a real live lord out here when Sir Frederick’s time is up.Eh?” "
"惠利船漫不经心地想，不明白为什么一个货真价实的勋爵不会跟别人干得一样好。不过，这可不是另一个人的观点。","Captain Whalley perfunctorily did not see why a lord of the right sort should not do as well as anyone else.But this was not the other’s point of view."
"“不，不。这个地方飞快地发展。现在，没有什么能拦得住它，足够派一个勋爵来了，”他用简短的话语吼着，“瞧瞧我们这个时代的变化吧。现在我们这里需要一个勋爵。他们在孟买已经任命了一个勋爵。” ","“No, no.Place runs itself.Nothing can stop it now.Good enough for a lord,” he growled in short sentences.“Look at the changes in our time.We need a lord here now.They have got a lord in Bombay.” "
"他每年都在总督府参加一两次宴会——府邸坐落在一座小山上，周围是公路和花园，那是一座有许多窗户和带拱廊的豪华宅邸。近来，他正领着一位公爵，乘坐着港务监督的大汽艇，去视察各港口的改进措施。在那以前，他“及其热心地”亲自去为公爵乘的这艘游艇选了一个很好的停泊处。然后他应邀参加了船上的午宴。公爵夫人亲自和他们共进午餐。一个红脸的大个子女人。肤色被太阳晒得很黑。他简直觉得是晒坏了。夫人态度倒是很文雅。他们要到日本去……","He dined once or twice every year at the Government House—a many-windowed, arcaded palace upon a hill laid out in roads and gardens.And lately he had been taking about a duke in his Master-Attendant’s steam-launch to visit the harbor improvements.Before that he had “most obligingly” gone out in person to pick out a good berth for the ducal yacht.Afterwards he had an invitation to lunch on board.The duchess herself lunched with them.A big woman with a red face.Complexion quite sunburnt.He should think ruined.Very gracious manners.They were going on to Japan...."
"他大喊大叫般地说出这些细节来开导惠利船长，有时候停住嘴，仿佛由于一种被压制的重要感，脸颊都鼓起来了；他还再三地噘出厚嘴唇，直到他那圆滚滚的红鼻子伸进雪白的小胡子。这地方飞快地发展啊，哪一位勋爵来都合适啊，他什么麻烦也没有啊，除了海运部门——除了海运部门，他重复说了两遍；接着重重地哼了一声，他开始叙述前几天美国驻法属交趾支那的总领事怎样发电报给他——以他官方的身份——要求派一个合格的人去接管一艘格拉斯哥的商船，那艘船的船长在西贡去世了。 ","He ejaculated these details for Captain Whalley’s edification, pausing to blow out his cheeks as if with a pent-up sense of importance, and repeatedly protruding his thick lips till the blunt crimson end of his nose seemed to dip into the milk of his mustache.The place ran itself; it was fit for any lord; it gave no trouble except in its Marine department—in its Marine department he repeated twice, and after a heavy snort began to relate how the other day her Majesty’s Consul-General in French Cochin-China had cabled to him—in his official capacity—asking for a qualified man to be sent over to take charge of a Glasgow ship whose master had died in Saigon."
"“我派人到海员之家高级海员的住处去传话，”他接着说，这时候他的声音越来越愤怒，他走路的步子也瘸得更明显了。“那地方满是人。人比当地这个行当所有的职位多一倍。都想找一份轻松的活。人数多一倍呢——但是——你是怎么想的，惠利？……” ","“I sent word of it to the officers’ quarters in the Sailors’ Home,” he continued, while the limp in his gait seemed to grow more accentuated with the increasing irritation of his voice.“Place’s full of them.Twice as many men as there are berths going in the local trade.All hungry for an easy job.Twice as many—and—What d’you think, Whalley?...” "
"他突然停了下来；双手握紧，使劲往下一撑，好像存心要把他短上衣的衣袋撑破似的。惠利船长不由自主地轻轻叹了一口气。","He stopped short; his hands clenched and thrust deeply downwards, seemed ready to burst the pockets of his jacket.A slight sigh escaped Captain Whalley."
"“嗨？你可能认为他们会你抢我夺。根本没那回事。害怕回国嘛。待在这里，躺在阳台上等活干又舒服又暖和。我坐在自己办公室里等。没有人来。他们是怎么想的？难道我会像个木头人那样老是坐在那里，面前摆着那封总领事的电报吗？不可能。我找出保存在我手边的一份他们的名单来看，通知汉密尔顿过来——他是那伙人中最游手好闲的一个——就让他过去。还威胁他说，要指示海员之家的总管干脆把他撵出去。他居然认为这份差事不——够——好。‘我手边有一份你的档案。’我说，‘你十八个月前在这里上岸。从那以后，你没有干过六个月的活。你在海员之家欠下了伙食费，我想你认为最后海运部门会给你付账。嗯？的确是会付账的，但是如果你不接受这个工作机会的话，一有回英国的轮船路过这里，你就乘那艘船回国去，一路上打打杂。你简直是个乞丐。我们这里不需要任何一个白人乞丐。’我把他吓住了。可是，你瞧瞧这一切给我带来的麻烦，”","“Hey?You would think they would be falling over each other.Not a bit of it.Frightened to go home.Nice and warm out here to lie about a veranda waiting for a job.I sit and wait in my office.Nobody.What did they suppose?That I was going to sit there like a dummy with the Consul-General’s cable before me?Not likely.So I looked up a list of them I keep by me and sent word for Hamilton—the worst loafer of them all—and just made him go.Threatened to instruct the steward of the Sailors’ Home to have him turned out neck and crop.He did not think the berth was good enough—if—you—please.‘I’ve your little records by me,’ said I.‘You came ashore here eighteen months ago, and you haven’t done six months’ work since.You are in debt for your board now at the Home, and I suppose you reckon the Marine Office will pay in the end.Eh?So it shall; but if you don’t take this chance, away you go to England, assisted passage, by the first homeward steamer that comes along.You are no better than a pauper.We don’t want any white paupers here.’ I scared him.But look at the trouble all this gave me.” "
"“如果你派人来找我的话，”惠利船长几乎不由自主地说，“你不会遇到任何麻烦的。”","“You would not have had any trouble,” Captain Whalley said almost involuntarily, “if you had sent for me.” "
"埃利奥特船长高兴极了；他一边走，一边笑得浑身打颤。但是，他突然不笑了。他模模糊糊地回想起来一件事。他不是听说过在特拉凡哥尔-德干银行倒闭的时候，可怜的惠利已经倾家荡产了吗？“天哪，老伙计手头紧啦！”他想，接着马上向他的伙伴瞟了一眼。然而惠利船长笔直地站在他的面前，稳重地微笑，脸上的神情叫人没法想象他会是个身无分文的人——于是他放心了。不可能。不可能一股脑完蛋。那艘船只不过是他的一个爱好罢了。他回想起这个人刚才承认过就在那天早晨，收到一笔数目可能相当大的钱，不可能需要向他借一小笔钱，这让他感到更加放心了。可是，他们的谈话中断了很久，他不知道怎样再次开始才好，只得严肃地嚷着说：“我们这些老家伙现在该休息了。”","Captain Eliott was immensely amused; he shook with laughter as he walked.But suddenly he stopped laughing.A vague recollection had crossed his mind.Hadn’t he heard it said at the time of the Travancore and Deccan smash that poor Whalley had been cleaned out completely.“Fellow’s hard up, by heavens!” he thought; and at once he cast a sidelong upward glance at his companion.But Captain Whalley was smiling austerely straight before him, with a carriage of the head inconceivable in a penniless man—and he became reassured.Impossible.Could not have lost everything.That ship had been only a hobby of his.And the reflection that a man who had confessed to receiving that very morning a presumably large sum of money was not likely to spring upon him a demand for a small loan put him entirely at his ease again.There had come a long pause in their talk, however, and not knowing how to begin again, he growled out soberly, “We old fellows ought to take a rest now.” "
"“对咱们有些人来说，最好的事情是死在船桨旁。”惠利船长漫不经心地说。","“The best thing for some of us would be to die at the oar,” Captain Whalley said negligently."
"“得了，别提了。你到现在还对你干的那些事情一点不腻烦吗？”另一个人阴沉着脸咕哝着。","“Come, now.Aren’t you a bit tired by this time of the whole show?” muttered the other sullenly."
"“你呢？”","“Are you?” "
"埃利奥特船长觉得腻烦。腻烦死了。他占着这个职位这么久，只是为了在回国以前能得到最高级别的养老金。尽管如此，还是得过穷日子；但是，他只能靠这笔钱，才不至于进济贫院。他还有个家呢。惠利知道，他有三个女儿。他告诉“哈里老弟”，那三个女儿是他最大的心事和烦恼。简直快把人逼疯了。","Captain Eliott was.Infernally tired.He only hung on to his berth so long in order to get his pension on the highest scale before he went home.It would be no better than poverty, anyhow; still, it was the only thing between him and the workhouse.And he had a family.Three girls, as Whalley knew.He gave “Harry, old boy,” to understand that these three girls were a source of the greatest anxiety and worry to him.Enough to drive a man distracted."
"“为什么？他们目前在干些什么？”惠利船长问，既感到有点兴趣，又显得有点心不在焉。","“Why?What have they been doing now?” asked Captain Whalley with a sort of amused absent-mindedness."
"“干什么！什么也不干。就是这么回事从早到晚都是什么草地网球啊、愚蠢的小说啊……”","“Doing!Doing nothing.That’s just it.Lawn-tennis and silly novels from morning to night....” "
"她们要是至少有一个是男孩的话该多好。偏偏三个都是丫头！更倒霉的是，世界上似乎再也没有什么正派的小伙子了。他在俱乐部里留意察看，只看到许多自以为是的花花公子，他们为人自私，不可能想到为一个善良的女人谋求幸福的。他瞪着眼，好像看到了极端贫困的景象和他养在家里的那一伙人。他一直想在乡下——在萨里——为自己盖一所小房子，安度晚年，但是他怕这是不可能的了…… 他抬起瞪着的眼睛，骨碌碌地转，流露出可怜巴巴的焦急神情，惠利船长不得不抑制住那个令人厌恶的想笑的念头，俯视着他，宽厚地点点头。","If one of them at least had been a boy.But all three!And, as ill-luck would have it, there did not seem to be any decent young fellows left in the world.When he looked around in the club he saw only a lot of conceited popinjays too selfish to think of making a good woman happy.Extreme indigence stared him in the face with all that crowd to keep at home.He had cherished the idea of building himself a little house in the country—in Surrey—to end his days in, but he was afraid it was out of the question,...and his staring eyes rolled upwards with such a pathetic anxiety that Captain Whalley charitably nodded down at him, restraining a sort of sickening desire to laugh."
"“你一定要亲自尝尝才知道这是什么滋味，哈里。女孩子真是令人十足的烦恼和担心。”","“You must know what it is yourself, Harry.Girls are the very devil for worry and anxiety.” "
"“啊！可我的女儿倒是挺不错嘛，”惠利船长慢腾腾地说，眼睛盯着大街的尽头。","“Ay!But mine is doing well,” Captain Whalley pronounced slowly, staring to the end of the avenue."
"港务监督听到这话很高兴。高兴极了。他还清楚的记得她。她是个漂亮的小姑娘。","The Master-Attendant was glad to hear this.Uncommonly glad.He remembered her well.A pretty girl she was."
"惠利船长一边漫不经心地迈着步子，一边好像在梦中似的表示同意。","Captain Whalley, stepping out carelessly, assented as if in a dream."
"“她确实是漂亮的。”","“She was pretty.” "
"马车的行列正在散开。","The procession of carriages was breaking up."
"马车一辆接一辆地离开了队伍，小跑着驶去，用分散了的生气和活力，给这条宽广的大街添上活泼的气息；可是不久庄严而孤独的气氛，又重新占领了这条又直又宽的大路。一个穿白衣服的马夫站在一匹缅甸马的马头旁边，那匹马套着一辆刷过清漆的二轮马车；人和马车停在路边，似乎跟孩子遗忘在参天大树底下的玩具一样大小。埃利奥特船长大摇大摆地走到马车跟前，做出一副好像要上车的姿态，但是并没有上去。他一只手轻轻地搁在车杠上，不再谈他的养老金、他的女儿和他的贫穷，又回到了世界上唯一的另一个话题——海运局、海员和港口的船。","One after another they left the file to go off at a trot, animating the vast avenue with their scattered life and movement; but soon the aspect of dignified solitude returned and took possession of the straight wide road.A syce in white stood at the head of a Burmah pony harnessed to a varnished two-wheel cart; and the whole thing waiting by the curb seemed no bigger than a child’s toy forgotten under the soaring trees.Captain Eliott waddled up to it and made as if to clamber in, but refrained; and keeping one hand resting easily on the shaft, he changed the conversation from his pension, his daughters, and his poverty back again to the only other topic in the world—the Marine Office, the men and the ships of the port."
"他继续给出一些例子，说明对他有些什么要求；他那瓮声瓮气的说话声，在寂静的空气中像一只巨大的黄蜂发出的没完没了的嗡嗡声，使人昏昏欲睡。惠利船长不知道是什么样的力量，或者说是什么样的软弱阻止他说晚安和走开。好像是他太累了，再也打不起精神动弹了。多么奇怪啊。比内德举出的那些例子更奇怪。难道仅仅是他那强烈的空闲感使他站在那里，听这些故事吗？并没有什么了不起的事使内德·埃利奥特烦恼；他被那呼哧呼哧、瓮声瓮气的声音弄得晕头转向，渐渐细心地分辨出有几分像那个年轻的斑鸠号船长的清晰、亲切的声音。他不知道自己是否也变到了这种程度；但是在他看来，他老朋友的声音好像没有变多少——人也和从前一样。人倒是不坏，兴致勃勃、讨人喜欢的内德.埃利奥特待人友好，对他自己的事情处理得很好——可是总有那么点胡说乱吹。他记得内德过去经常能给他可怜的妻子带来很多乐趣。她能看透那个人，好像看一本打开的书那样。当神鹰号和斑鸠号碰巧停在同一个港口的时候，她时常会要求他带埃利奥特船长来吃饭。自从那些日子过去以后，他们就不经常见面了。也许五年都见不了一回。他从雪白的眉毛下注视着这个人，他这个时候无法推心置腹地向这人吐露自己的情况；但是另一个人，则继续亲切地、滔滔不绝地高谈阔论；然而听他说话的那个人却觉得他很遥远，好像他在一英里外的山顶上说话似的。","He proceeded to give instances of what was expected of him; and his thick voice drowsed in the still air like the obstinate droning of an enormous bumble-bee.Captain Whalley did not know what was the force or the weakness that prevented him from saying good-night and walking away.It was as though he had been too tired to make the effort.How queer.More queer than any of Ned’s instances.Or was it that overpowering sense of idleness alone that made him stand there and listen to these stories.Nothing very real had ever troubled Ned Eliott; and gradually he seemed to detect deep in, as if wrapped up in the gross wheezy rumble, something of the clear hearty voice of the young captain of the Ringdove.He wondered if he too had changed to the same extent; and it seemed to him that the voice of his old chum had not changed so very much—that the man was the same.Not a bad fellow the pleasant, jolly Ned Eliott, friendly, well up to his business—and always a bit of a humbug.He remembered how he used to amuse his poor wife.She could read him like an open book.When the Condor and the Ringdove happened to be in port together, she would frequently ask him to bring Captain Eliott to dinner.They had not met often since those old days.Not once in five years, perhaps.He regarded from under his white eyebrows this man he could not bring himself to take into his confidence at this juncture; and the other went on with his intimate outpourings, and as remote from his hearer as though he had been talking on a hill-top a mile away."
"如今他正在为苏法拉号轮船感到有点为难。最后海港上的每一件麻烦事都落到他手里来解决。再过十八个月他就走了，他们会惦记他的；很可能是哪一个退休的海军军官被塞到这个职位上来了——一个什么都不懂，什么也不关心的人。那艘轮船是沿海岸航行的商船，和远至北方的德林达依有固定的贸易联系；但是困难在于找不到船长来使这艘船定期航行。没有人愿意来这艘船上干。当然他并不是真正有权去命令一个人接受工作。按照一位总领事的要求，放开限制去做一些事情倒是很好，只是……","He was in a bit of a quandary now as to the steamer Sofala.Ultimately every hitch in the port came into his hands to undo.They would miss him when he was gone in another eighteen months, and most likely some retired naval officer had been pitchforked into the appointment—a man that would understand nothing and care less.That steamer was a coasting craft having a steady trade connection as far north as Tenasserim; but the trouble was she could get no captain to take her on her regular trip.Nobody would go in her.He really had no power, of course, to order a man to take a job.It was all very well to stretch a point on the demand of a consul-general, but..."
"“那艘船有什么毛病吗？”惠利船长用经过斟酌的声调打断他的话。","“What’s the matter with the ship?” Captain Whalley interrupted in measured tones."
"“什么毛病都没有。好好一艘老轮船。今天下午它的主人在我的办公室里扯头发哪。”","“Nothing’s the matter.Sound old steamer.Her owner has been in my office this afternoon tearing his hair.” "
"“他是个白人吗？”惠利船长用一种感兴趣的声音问道。","“Is he a white man?” asked Whalley in an interested voice."
"“他自称是个白人，”港务监督轻蔑地回答，“不过，即使这样，也只是表面白，里面可不白。我当着他的面也这么说。”","“He calls himself a white man,” answered the Master-Attendant scornfully; “but if so, it’s just skin-deep and no more.I told him that to his face too.” "
"“那么，他是干什么的？”","“But who is he, then?” "
"“他是这艘船上的轮机长。明白了吧，哈里？”","“He’s the chief engineer of her.See @that@, Harry?” "
"“我明白了，”惠利船长沉思地说，“轮机长。我明白了。”","“I see,” Captain Whalley said thoughtfully.“The engineer.I see.” "
"这家伙怎么会同时成为一个船主，就说来话长了。埃利奥特船长记得，在将近十五年前，他在一艘英国船上当三副，有一次跟他的船长和轮机长大吵一架以后，就被辞退了。他们好像很高兴打发他走，不惜任何代价。明摆着他是一个不安分的家伙。从此以后，他一直待在这里，一个讨厌透顶的人，总是在船上干一阵就被辞退了，在哪一条船上都干不长；几乎殖民地这里所有船上的轮机间里他都待过。然后埃利奥特船长突然问：“你能想到后来发生了什么事吗，哈里？”","How the fellow came to be a shipowner at the same time was quite a tale.He came out third in a home ship nearly fifteen years ago, Captain Eliott remembered, and got paid off after a bad sort of row both with his skipper and his chief.Anyway, they seemed jolly glad to get rid of him at all costs.Clearly a mutinous sort of chap.Well, he remained out here, a perfect nuisance, everlastingly shipped and unshipped, unable to keep a berth very long; pretty nigh went through every engine-room afloat belonging to the colony.Then suddenly, “What do you think happened, Harry?” "
"惠利船长似乎在出神地想什么，好像在做心算一样，微微吓了一跳。他真的无法想象。那个港务监督的声音沉闷地振动着，还带着嘶哑的强调声。那个人确实交上了好运，赢得了马尼拉彩票的第二大奖。船上所有的轮机员和高级船员都买那种彩票。看来他们都热衷于这玩意。","Captain Whalley, who seemed lost in a mental effort as of doing a sum in his head, gave a slight start.He really couldn’t imagine.The Master-Attendant’s voice vibrated dully with hoarse emphasis.The man actually had the luck to win the second prize in the Manilla lottery.All these engineers and officers of ships took tickets in that gamble.It seemed to be a perfect mania with them all."
"那时人人都以为他会带着这笔钱回英国，会按照他自己的方式见鬼去。可压根不是这样。苏法拉号被认为太小，也不够新式，不能继续从事贸易往来了；几个船主已经从欧洲订购了一艘新汽船，所以打算把那艘船以适当的价格脱手。他急匆匆地前去买下了它。仅仅是得到一大笔钱这个事实本身就可能使人神魂颠倒，但是这个人一直没有流露出这种迹象——直到他有了一艘属于自己的船；然后他突然就得意忘形起来了；为了过户的事情，他一阵风似的闯进海运局，帽子压在左眼上，手里转动着一根小手杖，分别对各个办事员说：“现在没有人能把他撵出去了。该轮到他做主了。世界上再也没有人压在他的头上了，而且永远都不会有了。”他在办公桌之间趾高气扬、大摇大摆地转来转去，扯着嗓门说话，像片树叶那样不停地打哆嗦，结果是，他待在办公室的时间内，日常的事务只得暂时中断。而且在那个大房间里，人人都张大了嘴站着，看着他那滑稽的动作。后来，人们看到他在那天最热的时间里，在码头上跑来跑去，从不同的角度看他那艘船，脸红得像火一般。他似乎想要拦住他遇到的每一个陌生人，只是为了让他们知道，“再也没有人压在他的头上了；他已经买了一艘船；现在世界上没有人能把他从他的轮机室里撵出来了。”","Everybody expected now that he would take himself off home with his money, and go to the devil in his own way.Not at all.The Sofala, judged too small and not quite modern enough for the sort of trade she was in, could be got for a moderate price from her owners, who had ordered a new steamer from Europe.He rushed in and bought her.This man had never given any signs of that sort of mental intoxication the mere fact of getting hold of a large sum of money may produce—not till he got a ship of his own; but then he went off his balance all at once: came bouncing into the Marine Office on some transfer business, with his hat hanging over his left eye and switching a little cane in his hand, and told each one of the clerks separately that “Nobody could put him out now.It was his turn.There was no one over him on earth, and there never would be either.” He swaggered and strutted between the desks, talking at the top of his voice, and trembling like a leaf all the while, so that the current business of the office was suspended for the time he was in there, and everybody in the big room stood open-mouthed looking at his antics.Afterwards he could be seen during the hottest hours of the day with his face as red as fire rushing along up and down the quays to look at his ship from different points of view: he seemed inclined to stop every stranger he came across just to let them know “that there would be no longer anyone over him; he had bought a ship; nobody on earth could put him out of his engine-room now.” "
"尽管苏法拉号是个便宜货，买船的钱还是几乎耗尽了他全部中彩的奖金。他拿不出做生意的资金了。这还不怎么要紧，因为那时候正是轮船在沿海港口做生意的好日子，本地的那些航运业商号还没有想到建立当地的船队，在他们的几条主要航线上行驶。等这些船队组织起来以后，当然捞走了绝大部分油水；不久以后，一小队讨厌的德国货船，不定期地在苏伊士运河东面出现，把点点滴滴的残余一扫而光。它们沿着海岸，在岛屿之间来回地寻找便宜货，好像海中的一群鲨鱼，随时准备一口抢走你掉下去的任何东西；于是，以前的那些好日子永远结束了；据他判断，多年来苏法拉号只能维持过得去的局面。在埃利奥特船长看来，用尽所有方法来帮助一艘英国船维持下去，是他的职责所在；苏法拉号要是因为没有船长而漏掉航程的话，它很快就会失去它的生意，这是合乎情理的。难就难在这里。这个人太不切实际了。“从一开始就是叫花子发横财嘛，”他解释道，“随着时间的推移，情况似乎越来越坏了。过去三年里，他换了十一个船长；除了固定航线上的人以外，这里每个人他都试过了。我以前提醒过他，这样做不行。现在，当然没有人会考虑在苏法拉号上干了。我找过一两个人到我的办公室来，和他们谈话；但是他们对我说，接受那个职位，过上一个月受尽折磨的日子，在第一次航程结束后就被解雇，这有什么好处呢？那家伙当然跟我说，那些全是胡扯；有些人一直密谋策划了许多年，想要给他点颜色看看。现在已经开始了。海港上所有讨厌透了的海员都合伙整治他，要他屈服，因为他当过轮机员。”","Good bargain as she was, the price of the Sofala took up pretty near all the lottery-money.He had left himself no capital to work with.That did not matter so much, for these were the halcyon days of steam coasting trade, before some of the home shipping firms had thought of establishing local fleets to feed their main lines.These, when once organized, took the biggest slices out of that cake, of course; and by-and-by a squad of confounded German tramps turned up east of Suez Canal and swept up all the crumbs.They prowled on the cheap to and fro along the coast and between the islands, like a lot of sharks in the water ready to snap up anything you let drop.And then the high old times were over for good; for years the Sofala had made no more, he judged, than a fair living.Captain Eliott looked upon it as his duty in every way to assist an English ship to hold her own; and it stood to reason that if for want of a captain the Sofala began to miss her trips she would very soon lose her trade.There was the quandary.The man was too impracticable.“Too much of a beggar on horseback from the first,” he explained.“Seemed to grow worse as the time went on.In the last three years he’s run through eleven skippers; he had tried every single man here, outside of the regular lines.I had warned him before that this would not do.And now, of course, no one will look at the Sofala.I had one or two men up at my office and talked to them; but, as they said to me, what was the good of taking the berth to lead a regular dog’s life for a month and then get the sack at the end of the first trip?The fellow, of course, told me it was all nonsense; there has been a plot hatching for years against him.And now it had come.All the horrid sailors in the port had conspired to bring him to his knees, because he was an engineer.” "
"埃利奥特船长的喉咙里发出了一声暗笑。","Captain Eliott emitted a throaty chuckle."
"“事实是，如果他再漏掉几次航程的话，今后就再也不用麻烦他干什么航行了。以往经营的任何货物再也轮不到他了。现今的竞争是这么激烈，人们不可能把他们的货物搁着，去等一艘误了日期的船。他前景黯淡。可他发誓宁可把自己关在船上，饿死在船舱里，也决不会卖船——即使他能找到买主。但那是完全不可能的。哪怕是日本人，也不会按照船的保险价买下这艘船。这可不像卖帆船。轮船除了太陈旧以外，而且确实过时了。”","“And the fact is, that if he misses a couple more trips he need never trouble himself to start again.He won’t find any cargo in his old trade.There’s too much competition nowadays for people to keep their stuff lying about for a ship that does not turn up when she’s expected.It’s a bad lookout for him.He swears he will shut himself on board and starve to death in his cabin rather than sell her—even if he could find a buyer.And that’s not likely in the least.Not even the Japs would give her insured value for her.It isn’t like selling sailing-ships.Steamers @do@ get out of date, besides getting old.” "
"“不过，他一定储存了不少钱，”惠利船长轻轻地发表意见。","“He must have laid by a good bit of money though,” observed Captain Whalley quietly."
"那个港务监督鼓起他红得发紫的脸颊，鼓得叫人吃惊。","The Harbor-master puffed out his purple cheeks to an amazing size."
"“一个子儿也没存，哈里。一个——子儿——也没存。”","“Not a stiver, Harry.Not—a—single—sti-ver.” "
"他等着；但是惠利船长慢腾腾地捋着他的胡子，低头看着地面，一句话也不说，他就拍拍惠利的前臂，踮起脚，用嘶哑的声音悄悄地说：","He waited; but as Captain Whalley, stroking his beard slowly, looked down on the ground without a word, he tapped him on the forearm, tiptoed, and said in a hoarse whisper— "
"“马尼拉彩票把他刮干净了。”","“The Manilla lottery has been eating him up.” "
"他皱了一下眉头，用短促而使劲的动作点点头，表示赞成。他们都爱买这种彩票；付给高级船员的工资（“在我的港口里，”他哼了一声说）有三分之一流到马尼拉去了。他们喜欢得入了迷。那个家伙，马西，一开始跟其他人一样把钱白白浪费在彩票上；但是中过一回奖以后，他好像深信不疑，他只要不断地再买下去，就能得到另一次大奖。从那以后，每次开奖前，他都要买上大量的彩票。从他毫无远见地买了这艘船以后，一方面由于沉迷在这个坏习惯里，另一方面由于对业务的无知，他手头总是有点紧。","He frowned a little, nodding in tiny affirmative jerks.They all were going in for it; a third of the wages paid to ships’ officers (“in my port,” he snorted) went to Manilla.It was a mania.That fellow Massy had been bitten by it like the rest of them from the first; but after winning once he seemed to have persuaded himself he had only to try again to get another big prize.He had taken dozens and scores of tickets for every drawing since.What with this vice and his ignorance of affairs, ever since he had improvidently bought that steamer he had been more or less short of money."
"依埃利奥特船长看来，这倒是一个机会，能使一个通情达理、手头有几镑的海员登上船去，把那个蠢货从他那愚蠢的行为造成的严重后果中救出来。是他的狂热造成了他和船长们的争吵。他也遇到过几个真正的好人，如果他不找他们岔子的话，他们是会乐意呆下去的。但是不行。他要是在早晨不把一个人撵走，在晚上不跟一个新人争吵的话，好像就认为自己不是船主了。他缺少的是一个在适当条件下能在那艘船上投资两百磅左右的船长。如果你知道，一旦吩咐一个人收拾行李上岸以后，就得花钱买回他的股份的话，你就不会只是因为有趣，而去解雇一个毫无过错的人了。另一方面，一个在船上有收益的人，也不可能为了一点琐碎事就怒气冲冲地撂下他的差事。他对马西说过这种话。他说：“‘这样不行，马西先生。我们海运局对你非常头痛。现在你必须要做的是尝试，看能否找到一个海员做你的合伙人。那看来是唯一的方法了。’这可是忠告，哈里。”","This, in Captain Eliott’s opinion, gave an opening for a sensible sailor-man with a few pounds to step in and save that fool from the consequences of his folly.It was his craze to quarrel with his captains.He had had some really good men too, who would have been too glad to stay if he would only let them.But no.He seemed to think he was no owner unless he was kicking somebody out in the morning and having a row with the new man in the evening.What was wanted for him was a master with a couple of hundred or so to take an interest in the ship on proper conditions.You don’t discharge a man for no fault, only because of the fun of telling him to pack up his traps and go ashore, when you know that in that case you are bound to buy back his share.On the other hand, a fellow with an interest in the ship is not likely to throw up his job in a huff about a trifle.He had told Massy that.He had said: “‘This won’t do, Mr. Massy.We are getting very sick of you here in the Marine Office.What you must do now is to try whether you could get a sailor to join you as partner.That seems to be the only way.’ And that was sound advice, Harry.” "
"惠利船长靠在他的手杖上，浑身一动也不动；他的一只手本来在捋胡子，抓住了胡子也不动了。那个家伙听了这番话，说些什么呢？","Captain Whalley, leaning on his stick, was perfectly still all over, and his hand, arrested in the act of stroking, grasped his whole beard.And what did the fellow say to that?"
"那个家伙竟然大胆地对港务监督发脾气。他以放肆无理的态度对待这个劝告。“我不是来这里被人笑话的，”他尖叫起来，“我是一个英国人，又是一个被你那些穷得像乞丐一样的船员设下的无法无天的阴谋害得处于破产边缘的船主，我以这样的身份来向你呼吁，可你却高高在上，唯一为我做的只是劝我去找一个合伙人！”那个家伙竟敢勃然大怒，在我的私人办公室里跺脚。他上哪里去找一个合伙人啊？他被当成了一个蠢货吗？住在岸上海员之家里的那些没出息的家伙，没有一个衣袋里能掏出两便士来。就连市场上那些土著人也知道得很清楚。“这话倒是真的，哈里，”埃利奥特船长用低沉的声音公正地说，“他们极有可能人人都欠德纳姆路上中国人的钱，因为他们身上穿的衣服都是从那里赊来的。‘得了，’我说，‘你这么大吵大嚷的，我可受不了，马西先生。再见。’他走出房间，砰的一声关上了门；他竟然敢摔我的门，不要脸的东西！”","The fellow had the audacity to fly out at the Master-Attendant.He had received the advice in a most impudent manner.“I didn’t come here to be laughed at,” he had shrieked.“I appeal to you as an Englishman and a shipowner brought to the verge of ruin by an illegal conspiracy of your beggarly sailors, and all you condescend to do for me is to tell me to go and get a partner!”...The fellow had presumed to stamp with rage on the floor of the private office.Where was he going to get a partner?Was he being taken for a fool?Not a single one of that contemptible lot ashore at the “Home” had twopence in his pocket to bless himself with.The very native curs in the bazaar knew that much....“And it’s true enough, Harry,” rumbled Captain Eliott judicially.“They are much more likely one and all to owe money to the Chinamen in Denham Road for the clothes on their backs.‘Well,’ said I, ‘you make too much noise over it for my taste, Mr. Massy.Good morning.’ He banged the door after him; he dared to bang my door, confound his cheek!” "
"海运部门的长官气得上气不接下气，接着，可以说是终于想起来了：“我在这里跟你闲聊——吃晚饭的时间就得推迟。我妻子会不高兴的。”","The head of the Marine department was out of breath with indignation; then recollecting himself as it were, “I’ll end by being late to dinner—yarning with you here...wife doesn’t like it.” "
"他笨重地登上那辆马车，向一旁探出身子，这时候才气喘吁吁地想起来，不知道近来惠利船长究竟在干些什么。他们多少年没有见面了，直到前几天，他意外地在办公室里见到了惠利船长。","He clambered ponderously into the trap; leaned out sideways, and only then wondered wheezily what on earth Captain Whalley could have been doing with himself of late.They had had no sight of each other for years and years till the other day when he had seen him unexpectedly in the office."
"他究竟……","What on earth..."
"在惠利船长雪白的络腮胡子下，他的嘴唇上似乎流露出一丝微笑。","Captain Whalley seemed to be smiling to himself in his white beard."
"“世界到底是大的。”他含糊地说。","“The earth is big,” he said vaguely."
"另一个人似乎在咂摸这句话的滋味似的，坐在车座上，瞪着眼东张西望。空地上静悄悄的；只有从远处，从很远的地方，离海滨很远，越过了一片片草地，穿过了一长溜的树，微弱地传来了缆车的嘟嘟——嘟嘟——嘟嘟的声音，缆车从公共图书馆空荡荡的柱廊前出发，驶上三英里，来到新港码头。","The other, as if to test the statement, stared all round from his driving-seat.The Esplanade was very quiet; only from afar, from very far, a long way from the seashore, across the stretches of grass, through the long ranges of trees, came faintly the toot—toot—toot of the cable car beginning to roll before the empty peristyle of the Public Library on its three-mile journey to the New Harbor Docks."
"“自从那些德国佬来了以后，处处跟咱们挤在一起，”那个港务监督咆哮道，“世界上好像就没有那么多的回旋余地了。咱们闯荡的时候可不是这样的。”","“Doesn’t seem to be so much room on it,” growled the Master-Attendant, “since these Germans came along shouldering us at every turn.It was not so in our time.” "
"他陷入沉思，鼻息粗得像打呼噜一样，仿佛在睁着眼打盹。也许他自己，也从这个像沉默的朝圣者一样的人身上，觉察到了那个年轻的神鹰号船长早已淹没在记忆中的的风貌，他站在车轮旁，像个被拦住的旅行者。他是个好人——哈里·惠利——从不唠唠叨叨。你从来不知道他在忙些什么——对重要的人物太冷淡了一点，而且容易对一个同行的行为抱有错误的看法。而事实是，他对自己评价太高。他本来想让他登上马车，带他回家一起吃晚饭。然而谁知道呢。也许妻子会不高兴。","He fell into deep thought, breathing stertorously, as though he had been taking a nap open-eyed.Perhaps he too, on his side, had detected in the silent pilgrim-like figure, standing there by the wheel, like an arrested wayfarer, the buried lineaments of the features belonging to the young captain of the Condor.Good fellow—Harry Whalley—never very talkative.You never knew what he was up to—a bit too off-hand with people of consequence, and apt to take a wrong view of a fellow’s actions.Fact was he had a too good opinion of himself.He would have liked to tell him to get in and drive him home to dinner.But one never knew.Wife would not like it."
"“哈里，想想还真是有趣，”他继续用低沉的声音瓮声瓮气地说，“世界上所有的人当中，看来只留下你和我还记得这个地方过去是什么样……”","“And it’s funny to think, Harry,” he went on in a big, subdued drone, “that of all the people on it there seems only you and I left to remember this part of the world as it used to be...” "
"要不是他突然想起惠利船长一动也不动，一声也不吭，似乎在等什么——也许是在企盼什么，他都要陶醉在甜蜜的伤感情绪里了。他一下子抓住缰绳，突然坦率而亲切地吼叫起来：","He was ready to indulge in the sweetness of a sentimental mood had it not struck him suddenly that Captain Whalley, unstirring and without a word, seemed to be awaiting something—perhaps expecting...He gathered the reins at once and burst out in bluff, hearty growls— "
"“嗨！我的好老弟。我们认识的那些人——驾驶过的那些船——啊！还有干过的那些事……”","“Ha!My dear boy.The men we have known—the ships we’ve sailed—ay! and the things we’ve done...” "
"那匹小马猛地向前冲去——马夫赶紧跳到旁边去。惠利船长举起了他的胳膊。","The pony plunged—the syce skipped out of the way.Captain Whalley raised his arm."
"“再见。”","“Good-by.”"
"第六章","VI "
"太阳沉了下去。他用手杖钻了一个深深的洞；当他离开那个地方的时候，黑夜已经在树下面集结了它的队伍——阴影。阴影密布在条条大街的东端，好像只等一声令下，就向世界的开阔之地全面进军；阴影还低低地聚集在石头砌成的深深的运河两岸之间。那艘马来亚快帆船半掩在桥的拱顶下，位置一点也没有变过。惠利船长在桥栏杆旁盯着下面看了很久，直到那艘覆盖着棕榈叶席子的、一动不动地浮在水面上的船，在他眼中好像渐渐变成了费解和可怕的东西。黄昏的微光从天顶消失了；它的反光离开了下面的世界，运河里的水也变得一片漆黑。惠利船长从桥上走了过去。","The sun had set.And when, after drilling a deep hole with his stick, he moved from that spot the night had massed its army of shadows under the trees.They filled the eastern ends of the avenues as if only waiting the signal for a general advance upon the open spaces of the world; they were gathering low between the deep stone-faced banks of the canal.The Malay prau, half-concealed under the arch of the bridge, had not altered its position a quarter of an inch.For a long time Captain Whalley stared down over the parapet, till at last the floating immobility of that beshrouded thing seemed to grow upon him into something inexplicable and alarming.The twilight abandoned the zenith; its reflected gleams left the world below, and the water of the canal seemed to turn into pitch.Captain Whalley crossed it."
"向右拐弯，就是他回旅馆去的路，没有几步远就到了。他再次停下脚步（海滨所有的房子都关门了，码头周围空荡荡的，除了远处有一两个当地土人在走动以外），他开始计算一共花掉了多少钱。在旅馆里住了那么多天，每天得花那么多钱。他用手指头计算有多少天；一只手伸在衣袋里，把几个银币摇的叮当响。可以再呆上三天；然后，除非事情发生转机，他就不得不动用那五百磅了——艾薇的钱——存在他父亲这里的。在他看来，用这笔储备金买来的第一顿饭就会难以下咽——这是肯定的。理智是没有用的。这是一个感情问题。他的感情从来没有欺骗过他。","The turning to the right, which was his way to his hotel, was only a very few steps farther.He stopped again (all the houses of the sea-front were shut up, the quayside was deserted, but for one or two figures of natives walking in the distance) and began to reckon the amount of his bill.So many days in the hotel at so many dollars a day.To count the days he used his fingers: plunging one hand into his pocket, he jingled a few silver coins.All right for three days more; and then, unless something turned up, he must break into the five hundred—Ivy’s money—invested in her father.It seemed to him that the first meal coming out of that reserve would choke him—for certain.Reason was of no use.It was a matter of feeling.His feelings had never played him false."
"他并不向右拐弯。他继续向前走，好像锚地上依然停泊着一艘船，让他可以在黄昏时分登上去。远处的房子后面，在望得见的码头附近，深蓝色海岬的斜坡上有一家工厂；从那细长的圆柱形烟囱里冒出来的烟，静悄悄地一直上升到清澈的天空中。防波堤的尽头有五六条舢板漂浮在水面上，一个蜷缩在船尾的中国人看到了有人在招手。他跳起身来，很快把辫子盘在脖子上，又动作麻利地两下子就把肥大的黑裤子高高卷到他黄色的大腿上面；他无声地把双桨像鱼鳍那样微微一摆动，那条舢板就沿着防波堤的台阶弯弯曲曲地前进，动作从容而精确，犹如一条在水里游着的鱼。","He did not turn to the right.He walked on, as if there still had been a ship in the roadstead to which he could get himself pulled off in the evening.Far away, beyond the houses, on the slope of an indigo promontory closing the view of the quays, the slim column of a factory-chimney smoked quietly straight up into the clear air.A Chinaman, curled down in the stern of one of the half-dozen sampans floating off the end of the jetty, caught sight of a beckoning hand.He jumped up, rolled his pigtail round his head swiftly, tucked in two rapid movements his wide dark trousers high up his yellow thighs, and by a single, noiseless, finlike stir of the oars, sheered the sampan alongside the steps with the ease and precision of a swimming fish."
"“苏法拉号，”惠利船长站在岸上清晰地说出了这个词；然后那个中国人，很可能是个新移民，带着紧张的注意神情向上盯着看，好像在等着看这个奇怪的词从白人的嘴里掉出来。“苏法拉号。”惠利船长重复道；但是他突然失去了勇气。他停下了。海岸啊，小岛啊，高地啊，低岬啊，都是模糊一片；水平线变得暗沉沉的；越过东边那一片海岸，在本城的那些掩映在棕榈树中的、高低不平的屋顶前面，有一块白色的方尖碑——它是电报电缆上岸处的标志——像苍白的幽灵那样站立在海岸上。惠利船长又开口说： ","“Sofala,” articulated Captain Whalley from above; and the Chinaman, a new emigrant probably, stared upwards with a tense attention as if waiting to see the queer word fall visibly from the white man’s lips.“Sofala,” Captain Whalley repeated; and suddenly his heart failed him.He paused.The shores, the islets, the high ground, the low points, were dark: the horizon had grown somber; and across the eastern sweep of the shore the white obelisk, marking the landing-place of the telegraph-cable, stood like a pale ghost on the beach before the dark spread of uneven roofs, intermingled with palms, of the native town.Captain Whalley began again."
"“苏法拉号。摆渡到苏法拉号，明白吗？”","“Sofala.Savee So-fa-la, John?” "
"这一回，中国人听懂了那个稀奇古怪的声音，从他那毛糙的喉咙深处，粗鲁地咕哝了一声，表示同意。第一颗闪烁着黄色光芒的星星出现了，犹如针尖一般，深深地钉在了光滑、苍白、微微发亮的天空中，而后就出现了一阵强劲的寒风，刀割般地劈开了大地的温暖气息。这时惠利船长正在跨上舢板，去试试看能否当上苏法拉号的船长，他微微打了个冷颤。 ","This time the Chinaman made out that bizarre sound, and grunted his assent uncouthly, low down in his bare throat.With the first yellow twinkle of a star that appeared like the head of a pin stabbed deep into the smooth, pale, shimmering fabric of the sky, the edge of a keen chill seemed to cleave through the warm air of the earth.At the moment of stepping into the sampan to go and try for the command of the Sofala Captain Whalley shivered a little."
"当他重新踏上码头的时候，金星宛如一颗精美的宝石，低低地嵌在天空的边缘，在他身后的锚地上投下微弱的金色尾光，锚地平得像一块黑色的、擦亮了的石头地板。林荫道那高高的穹顶是黑的——头顶上漆黑一片——灯柱上的瓷球像蛋形的珍珠一样，巨大而明亮，一列伸展开去，似乎越远越低，遥远的另一头好像和他的膝盖一样低。他背着双手。现在要冷静地考虑这件事才好，他明天就要做最后的决定了。他的脚在沙砾上踩出嘎吱嘎吱的响声——要好好考虑这件事。要是还有切实可行的第二选择的话，那么就比较容易估计。他对这件事的诚意是不容置疑的：他对那个家伙也是出于好心。每过片刻，他自己的影子就在他身旁热切地跳起，映在树干上，拉得更长，倾斜而模糊，离草地很高——重复着他的步伐。","When on his return he landed on the quay again Venus, like a choice jewel set low on the hem of the sky, cast a faint gold trail behind him upon the roadstead, as level as a floor made of one dark and polished stone.The lofty vaults of the avenues were black—all black overhead—and the porcelain globes on the lamp-posts resembled egg-shaped pearls, gigantic and luminous, displayed in a row whose farther end seemed to sink in the distance, down to the level of his knees.He put his hands behind his back.He would now consider calmly the discretion of it before saying the final word to-morrow.His feet scrunched the gravel loudly—the discretion of it.It would have been easier to appraise had there been a workable alternative.The honesty of it was indubitable: he meant well by the fellow; and periodically his shadow leaped up intense by his side on the trunks of the trees, to lengthen itself, oblique and dim, far over the grass—repeating his stride."
"要好好考虑这件事。有选择的余地吗？他似乎已经丧失了生命中的一部分东西了；为了活命，他已经把他的一部分诚实和尊严交给一个饿鬼了。但是，活下去才是必要的。让贫穷肆无忌惮地逼人付出耻辱的代价吧。无疑，内德·埃利奥特在无意中帮了他一个忙，一个他不可能去要求内德帮的忙。他希望内德不会认为他的行动有什么鬼鬼祟祟的地方。他推想内德听到了他的举动后会理解——或者内德只会认为惠利是个古怪的老蠢货。告诉内德有什么好呢——还不是跟不假思索地就把事情全部吐露给那个叫马西的人听一样？五百磅准备投资马西的船。让他去充分利用这笔钱做买卖。让他惊奇去吧。你要一个船长——我要一艘船。这就够了。但是——呃——呃——呃。那艘空荡荡、黑魆魆、发出回声的船给他的印象是多么令人厌恶啊……一艘闲置着的轮船等同于一个废物，这是千准万确的。不知为何，只要公道的老天刮起一阵风，一艘帆船似乎随时都会恢复生命。然而一艘轮船，惠利船长想，熄了火，没有温暖的气息从下面升到甲板上来欢迎你，没有水蒸气的嘶嘶声，胸膛里没有铁器的碰撞声——躺在那里，冰凉，一动不动，没有脉搏，如同一具尸体。 ","The discretion of it.Was there a choice?He seemed already to have lost something of himself; to have given up to a hungry specter something of his truth and dignity in order to live.But his life was necessary.Let poverty do its worst in exacting its toll of humiliation.It was certain that Ned Eliott had rendered him, without knowing it, a service for which it would have been impossible to ask.He hoped Ned would not think there had been something underhand in his action.He supposed that now when he heard of it he would understand—or perhaps he would only think Whalley an eccentric old fool.What would have been the good of telling him—any more than of blurting the whole tale to that man Massy?Five hundred pounds ready to invest.Let him make the best of that.Let him wonder.You want a captain—I want a ship.That’s enough.B-r-r-r-r.What a disagreeable impression that empty, dark, echoing steamer had made upon him....A laid-up steamer was a dead thing and no mistake; a sailing-ship somehow seems always ready to spring into life with the breath of the incorruptible heaven; but a teamer, thought Captain Whalley, with her fires out, without the warm whiffs from below meeting you on her decks, without the hiss of steam, the clangs of iron in her breast—lies there as cold and still and pulseless as a corpse."
"在孤独的大街上，头上漆黑一片，下面倒有灯光。惠利船长正在考虑今后该怎么办，好像是偶然地，想到了死。他厌恶而轻蔑地把这个念头撂在了一边。他几乎嘲笑这个念头；他只是高兴地想到，自己年纪这么大，还有止不住的活力，需要很少的东西就能维持生活。对那个可怜的女人来说，她父亲这个结实的身躯真是个不坏的投资。至于其他——万一出了什么事情——协议书上要写明白：这五百磅必须在三个月内完整无缺地还给她。完整无缺地。一个便士也不能少。他绝不会失去她的一分钱，无论他得失去别的什么——一点儿尊严——几分自尊心。他以前从来不允许自己给任何人留下丝毫不正确的印象。得了，随它去吧——为了她着想嘛。毕竟，他从来没有说过一句会使人误解的话——可是惠利船长觉得自己已经腐坏到了骨子里。他从内心里轻蔑这种市侩气的精明，不禁微微笑出声来。显而易见，跟那种家伙打交道，而他们之间的关系又那么特殊，把一切和盘托出是不行的。他不喜欢那个家伙。他不喜欢他片刻说一阵奉承话，片刻又突然发泄一通怨气。说到底——那是个可怜虫。他才不喜欢处在他的位置呢。毕竟，人们的心眼并不坏。他不喜欢他那光滑的头发，他那奇怪的成直角的站相，趾高气扬，眼睛斜着从肩膀边上瞟你。不。总体说来，人们并不坏——他们只是愚蠢，或者不快活而已。","In the solitude of the avenue, all black above and lighted below, Captain Whalley, considering the discretion of his course, met, as it were incidentally, the thought of death.He pushed it aside with dislike and contempt.He almost laughed at it; and in the unquenchable vitality of his age only thought with a kind of exultation how little he needed to keep body and soul together.Not a bad investment for the poor woman this solid carcass of her father.And for the rest—in case of anything—the agreement should be clear: the whole five hundred to be paid back to her integrally within three months.Integrally.Every penny.He was not to lose any of her money whatever else had to go—a little dignity—some of his self-respect.He had never before allowed anybody to remain under any sort of false impression as to himself.Well, let that go—for her sake.After all, he had never @said@ anything misleading—and Captain Whalley felt himself corrupt to the marrow of his bones.He laughed a little with the intimate scorn of his worldly prudence.Clearly, with a fellow of that sort, and in the peculiar relation they were to stand to each other, it would not have done to blurt out everything.He did not like the fellow.He did not like his spells of fawning loquacity and bursts of resentfulness.In the end—a poor devil.He would not have liked to stand in his shoes.Men were not evil, after all.He did not like his sleek hair, his queer way of standing at right angles, with his nose in the air, and glancing along his shoulder at you.No.On the whole, men were not bad—they were only silly or unhappy."
"惠利船长不再考虑一下步怎么办才好了——他前面还有漫漫长夜需要度过呢。在明亮的灯光下，他的长络腮胡子像白银的护胸铠，闪闪发亮；在两盏路灯之间的地方，他那魁梧的身躯模糊地走过去，显得很高大，仿佛是在漫步，带着神秘的气息。不，人们内心并没有那么坏：一个影子一直跟着他，斜倚在他的左手上——在东方，这是一个不祥的预兆。","Captain Whalley had finished considering the discretion of that step—and there was the whole long night before him.In the full light his long beard would glisten like a silver breastplate covering his heart; in the spaces between the lamps his burly figure passed less distinct, loomed very big, wandering, and mysterious.No; there was not much real harm in men: and all the time a shadow marched with him, slanting on his left hand—which in the East is a presage of evil."
"“现在能看见那簇棕榈树吗，水手长？”在苏法拉号驶近巴都巴鲁的时候，惠利船长坐在驾驶台的那张椅子上问。 ","“Can you make out the clump of palms yet, Serang?” asked Captain Whalley from his chair on the bridge of the Sofala approaching the bar of Batu Beru."
"“还不能，先生。很快就能看见了。”那个马来老人穿着一身蓝色的粗斜纹布衣服，站在驾驶台的天篷底下，黑色的双脚瘦骨嶙峋的；他背着双手，瞪着眼睛盯着前方看，数不清的皱纹堆在眼角。","“No, Tuan.By-and-by see.” The old Malay, in a blue dungaree suit, planted on his bony dark feet under the bridge awning, put his hands behind his back and stared ahead out of the innumerable wrinkles at the corners of his eyes."
"惠利船长一动也不动地坐在那里，并没有亲自抬头看。三年——三十六次。他已经从南方看过这些棕榈树三十六次了。适当的时候，那些棕榈树就会进入你的视野。谢天谢地，这艘老船一次又一次地完成了航行任务，像时钟一样正确。最后他又咕哝了：","Captain Whalley sat still, without lifting his head to look for himself.Three years—thirty-six times.He had made these palms thirty-six times from the southward.They would come into view at the proper time.Thank God, the old ship made her courses and distances trip after trip, as correct as clockwork.At last he murmured again— "
"“现在看见了吗？”","“In sight yet?” "
"“阳光刺得人睁不开眼，先生。”","“The sun makes a very great glare, Tuan.” "
"“好好看，水手长。”","“Watch well, Serang.” "
"“是，先生。”","“Ya, Tuan.” "
"一个白人无声地从甲板的扶梯上走了上来，悄悄地听着这短短的对话。接着他走到驾驶台上，开始不断地从这一头走到另一头，举着他那樱桃木的长柄烟斗。他一绺绺长长的黑头发涂着厚厚的发蜡，横粘在秃了的头顶上；他的额头上满是皱纹，肤色蜡黄，还有一个难看的大鼻子。稀疏的络腮胡子掩盖不了他下巴的轮廓。他作出一副沉思的忧虑模样，吸着弯曲的黑烟嘴，显出了一个非常粗笨而突出的侧面像，连那个水手长有时候都忍不住想，有些白人真是丑到了极点。","A white man had ascended the ladder from the deck noiselessly, and had listened quietly to this short colloquy.Then he stepped out on the bridge and began to walk from end to end, holding up the long cherrywood stem of a pipe.His black hair lay plastered in long lanky wisps across the bald summit of his head; he had a furrowed brow, a yellow complexion, and a thick shapeless nose.A scanty growth of whisker did not conceal the contour of his jaw.His aspect was of brooding care; and sucking at a curved black mouthpiece, he presented such a heavy overhanging profile that even the Serang could not help reflecting sometimes upon the extreme unloveliness of some white men."
"惠利船长坐在椅子上，似乎打起精神来了，但是对那个人的到来没有做出任何反应。另一个人则喷着一口口的烟，然后突然说：","Captain Whalley seemed to brace himself up in his chair, but gave no recognition whatever to his presence.The other puffed jets of smoke; then suddenly— "
"“我再怎么也搞不懂你这个新爱好，让这个马来人跟你形影不离地呆在这里，我的合伙人。”","“I could never understand that new mania of yours of having this Malay here for your shadow, partner.” "
"惠利船长从椅子上站起身来，显得魁梧庄严，笔直地走到了罗盘箱前，另一个人不得不仓促后退，手里的那个烟斗在颤抖，好像他受到了恐吓似的。“现在简直不把我放在眼里了。”他用有点惊慌和狼狈的声音咕哝着。然后他慢条斯理而清清楚楚地说：","Captain Whalley got up from the chair in all his imposing stature and walked across to the binnacle, holding such an unswerving course that the other had to back away hurriedly, and remained as if intimidated, with the pipe trembling in his hand.“Walk over me now,” he muttered in a sort of astounded and discomfited whisper.Then slowly and distinctly he said— "
"“我—不—是—低—三—下—四—的—人。”接着气冲冲地加了一句，“看来你是这么想的。”","“I—am—not—dirt.” And then added defiantly, “As you seem to think.” "
"水手长突然说：","The Serang jerked out— "
"“现在看见那些棕榈树了，先生。”","“See the palms now, Tuan.” "
"惠利船长向前大步走去，来到栏杆旁；但是他并没有用海员那自信敏锐的眼光，笔直地看向那个地方，他的眼睛犹豫地看来看去，好像他，这个好几条新航线的发现者，在这片狭窄的海面上迷失了方向。","Captain Whalley strode forward to the rail; but his eyes, instead of going straight to the point, with the assured keen glance of a sailor, wandered irresolutely in space, as though he, the discoverer of new routes, had lost his way upon this narrow sea."
"另一个白人，大副，来到了驾驶台上。他个子高高的，年轻、瘦削，留着骑警式的小胡子，眼睛里带着几分不怀好意的神情。他在轮机长旁边站住脚。惠利船长背对着他们问道：","Another white man, the mate, came up on the bridge.He was tall, young, lean, with a mustache like a trooper, and something malicious in the eye.He took up a position beside the engineer.Captain Whalley, with his back to them, inquired— "
"“测程仪上是多少？”","“What’s on the log?” "
"“八十五。”大副迅速地回答，然后用胳膊肘轻轻地推推轮机长。","“Eighty-five,” answered the mate quickly, and nudged the engineer with his elbow."
"惠利船长那满是肌肉的双手用非同寻常的力量紧紧握住铁栏杆；他使出浑身的力气瞪圆了眼；他紧皱着眉；汗水从他的帽子下面流下来——他用微弱的声音呐呐地说：“方位校准以后，水手长——把稳舵，照直走。”","Captain Whalley’s muscular hands squeezed the iron rail with an extraordinary force; his eyes glared with an enormous effort; he knitted his eyebrows, the perspiration fell from under his hat,—and in a faint voice he murmured, “Steady her, Serang—when she is on the proper bearing.” "
"沉默的马来人向后退去，等了一下，举起一支胳膊，提醒舵手。舵轮飞速旋转，以控制船的摇摆。那个大副又用胳膊肘轻轻地推推轮机长。但是马西对着他骂开了。","The silent Malay stepped back, waited a little, and lifted his arm warningly to the helmsman.The wheel revolved rapidly to meet the swing of the ship.Again the made nudged the engineer.But Massy turned upon him."
"“斯特恩先生，”他恶狠狠地说，“我以船主的身份老实告诉你，你是个讨厌透顶的蠢货。”","“Mr. Sterne,” he said violently, “let me tell you—as a shipowner—that you are no better than a confounded fool.”"
"VII ","VII "
"Sterne went down smirking and apparently not at all disconcerted, but the engineer Massy remained on the bridge, moving about with uneasy self-assertion.Everybody on board was his inferior—everyone without exception.He paid their wages and found them in their food.They ate more of his bread and pocketed more of his money than they were worth; and they had no care in the world, while he alone had to meet all the difficulties of shipowning.When he contemplated his position in all its menacing entirety, it seemed to him that he had been for years the prey of a band of parasites: and for years he had scowled at everybody connected with the Sofala except, perhaps, at the Chinese firemen who served to get her along.Their use was manifest: they were an indispensable part of the machinery of which he was the master.","Sterne went down smirking and apparently not at all disconcerted, but the engineer Massy remained on the bridge, moving about with uneasy self-assertion.Everybody on board was his inferior—everyone without exception.He paid their wages and found them in their food.They ate more of his bread and pocketed more of his money than they were worth; and they had no care in the world, while he alone had to meet all the difficulties of shipowning.When he contemplated his position in all its menacing entirety, it seemed to him that he had been for years the prey of a band of parasites: and for years he had scowled at everybody connected with the Sofala except, perhaps, at the Chinese firemen who served to get her along.Their use was manifest: they were an indispensable part of the machinery of which he was the master."
"When he passed along his decks he shouldered those he came across brutally; but the Malay deck hands had learned to dodge out of his way.He had to bring himself to tolerate them because of the necessary manual labor of the ship which must be done.He had to struggle and plan and scheme to keep the Sofala afloat—and what did he get for it?Not even enough respect.They could not have given him enough of that if all their thoughts and all their actions had been directed to that end.The vanity of possession, the vainglory of power, had passed away by this time, and there remained only the material embarrassments, the fear of losing that position which had turned out not worth having, and an anxiety of thought which no abject subservience of men could repay.","When he passed along his decks he shouldered those he came across brutally; but the Malay deck hands had learned to dodge out of his way.He had to bring himself to tolerate them because of the necessary manual labor of the ship which must be done.He had to struggle and plan and scheme to keep the Sofala afloat—and what did he get for it?Not even enough respect.They could not have given him enough of that if all their thoughts and all their actions had been directed to that end.The vanity of possession, the vainglory of power, had passed away by this time, and there remained only the material embarrassments, the fear of losing that position which had turned out not worth having, and an anxiety of thought which no abject subservience of men could repay."
"He walked up and down.The bridge was his own after all.He had paid for it; and with the stem of the pipe in his hand he would stop short at times as if to listen with a profound and concentrated attention to the deadened beat of the engines (his own engines) and the slight grinding of the steering chains upon the continuous low wash of water alongside.But for these sounds, the ship might have been lying as still as if moored to a bank, and as silent as if abandoned by every living soul; only the coast, the low coast of mud and mangroves with the three palms in a bunch at the back, grew slowly more distinct in its long straight line, without a single feature to arrest attention.The native passengers of the Sofala lay about on mats under the awnings; the smoke of her funnel seemed the only sign of her life and connected with her gliding motion in a mysterious manner.","He walked up and down.The bridge was his own after all.He had paid for it; and with the stem of the pipe in his hand he would stop short at times as if to listen with a profound and concentrated attention to the deadened beat of the engines (his own engines) and the slight grinding of the steering chains upon the continuous low wash of water alongside.But for these sounds, the ship might have been lying as still as if moored to a bank, and as silent as if abandoned by every living soul; only the coast, the low coast of mud and mangroves with the three palms in a bunch at the back, grew slowly more distinct in its long straight line, without a single feature to arrest attention.The native passengers of the Sofala lay about on mats under the awnings; the smoke of her funnel seemed the only sign of her life and connected with her gliding motion in a mysterious manner."

"This submarine ridge of mud, scoured by the stream out of the soft bottom of the river and heaped up far out on the hard bottom of the sea, was difficult to get over.The alluvial coast having no distinguishing marks, the bearings of the crossing-place had to be taken from the shape of the mountains inland.The guidance of a form flattened and uneven at the top like a grinder tooth, and of another smooth, saddle-backed summit, had to be searched for within the great unclouded glare that seemed to shift and float like a dry fiery mist, filling the air, ascending from the water, shrouding the distances, scorching to the eye.In this veil of light the near edge of the shore alone stood out almost coal-black with an opaque and motionless solidity.Thirty miles away the serrated range of the interior stretched across the horizon, its outlines and shades of blue, faint and tremulous like a background painted on airy gossamer on the quivering fabric of an impalpable curtain let down to the plain of alluvial soil; and the openings of the estuary appeared, shining white, like bits of silver let into the square pieces snipped clean and sharp out of the body of the land bordered with mangroves.","This submarine ridge of mud, scoured by the stream out of the soft bottom of the river and heaped up far out on the hard bottom of the sea, was difficult to get over.The alluvial coast having no distinguishing marks, the bearings of the crossing-place had to be taken from the shape of the mountains inland.The guidance of a form flattened and uneven at the top like a grinder tooth, and of another smooth, saddle-backed summit, had to be searched for within the great unclouded glare that seemed to shift and float like a dry fiery mist, filling the air, ascending from the water, shrouding the distances, scorching to the eye.In this veil of light the near edge of the shore alone stood out almost coal-black with an opaque and motionless solidity.Thirty miles away the serrated range of the interior stretched across the horizon, its outlines and shades of blue, faint and tremulous like a background painted on airy gossamer on the quivering fabric of an impalpable curtain let down to the plain of alluvial soil; and the openings of the estuary appeared, shining white, like bits of silver let into the square pieces snipped clean and sharp out of the body of the land bordered with mangroves."
"On the forepart of the bridge the giant and the pigmy muttered to each other frequently in quiet tones.Behind them Massy stood sideways with an expression of disdain and suspense on his face.His globular eyes were perfectly motionless, and he seemed to have forgotten the long pipe he held in his hand.","On the forepart of the bridge the giant and the pigmy muttered to each other frequently in quiet tones.Behind them Massy stood sideways with an expression of disdain and suspense on his face.His globular eyes were perfectly motionless, and he seemed to have forgotten the long pipe he held in his hand."
"On the fore-deck below the bridge, steeply roofed with the white slopes of the awnings, a young lascar seaman had clambered outside the rail.He adjusted quickly a broad band of sail canvas under his armpits, and throwing his chest against it, leaned out far over the water.The sleeves of his thin cotton shirt, cut off close to the shoulder, bared his brown arm of full rounded form and with a satiny skin like a woman’s.He swung it rigidly with the rotary and menacing action of a slinger: the 14-lb. weight hurtled circling in the air, then suddenly flew ahead as far as the curve of the bow.The wet thin line swished like scratched silk running through the dark fingers of the man, and the plunge of the lead close to the ship’s side made a vanishing silvery scar upon the golden glitter; then after an interval the voice of the young Malay uplifted and long-drawn declared the depth of the water in his own language.","On the fore-deck below the bridge, steeply roofed with the white slopes of the awnings, a young lascar seaman had clambered outside the rail.He adjusted quickly a broad band of sail canvas under his armpits, and throwing his chest against it, leaned out far over the water.The sleeves of his thin cotton shirt, cut off close to the shoulder, bared his brown arm of full rounded form and with a satiny skin like a woman’s.He swung it rigidly with the rotary and menacing action of a slinger: the 14-lb.weight hurtled circling in the air, then suddenly flew ahead as far as the curve of the bow.The wet thin line swished like scratched silk running through the dark fingers of the man, and the plunge of the lead close to the ship’s side made a vanishing silvery scar upon the golden glitter; then after an interval the voice of the young Malay uplifted and long-drawn declared the depth of the water in his own language."
"“Tiga stengah,” he cried after each splash and pause, gathering the line busily for another cast.“Tiga stengah,” which means three fathom and a half.For a mile or so from seaward there was a uniform depth of water right up to the bar.“Half-three.Half-three.Half-three,”—and his modulated cry, returned leisurely and monotonous, like the repeated call of a bird, seemed to float away in sunshine and disappear in the spacious silence of the empty sea and of a lifeless shore lying open, north and south, east and west, without the stir of a single cloud-shadow or the whisper of any other voice.","“Tiga stengah,” he cried after each splash and pause, gathering the line busily for another cast.“Tiga stengah,” which means three fathom and a half.For a mile or so from seaward there was a uniform depth of water right up to the bar.“Half-three.Half-three.Half-three,”—and his modulated cry, returned leisurely and monotonous, like the repeated call of a bird, seemed to float away in sunshine and disappear in the spacious silence of the empty sea and of a lifeless shore lying open, north and south, east and west, without the stir of a single cloud-shadow or the whisper of any other voice."
"The owner-engineer of the Sofala remained very still behind the two seamen of different race, creed, and color; the European with the time-defying vigor of his old frame, the little Malay, old, too, but slight and shrunken like a withered brown leaf blown by a chance wind under the mighty shadow of the other.Very busy looking forward at the land, they had not a glance to spare; and Massy, glaring at them from behind, seemed to resent their attention to their duty like a personal slight upon himself.","The owner-engineer of the Sofala remained very still behind the two seamen of different race, creed, and color; the European with the time-defying vigor of his old frame, the little Malay, old, too, but slight and shrunken like a withered brown leaf blown by a chance wind under the mighty shadow of the other.Very busy looking forward at the land, they had not a glance to spare; and Massy, glaring at them from behind, seemed to resent their attention to their duty like a personal slight upon himself."

he did not seem to see them at all.Indeed he never recognized his ship mates on shore.At table (the four white men of the Sofala messed together) he sat looking into his plate dispassionately, but at the end of the meal would jump up and bolt down below as if a sudden thought had impelled him to rush and see whether somebody had not stolen the engines while he dined.In port at the end of the trip he went ashore regularly, but no one knew where he spent his evenings or in what manner.The local coasting fleet had preserved a wild and incoherent tale of his infatuation for the wife of a sergeant in an Irish infantry regiment.The regiment, however, had done its turn of garrison duty there ages before, and was gone somewhere to the other side of the earth, out of men’s knowledge.Twice or perhaps three times in the course of the year he would take too much to drink.On these occasions he returned on board at an earlier hour than usual; ran across the deck balancing himself with his spread arms like a tight-rope walker; and locking the door of his cabin, he would converse and argue with himself the livelong night in an amazing variety of tones; storm, sneer, and whine with an inexhaustible persistence.Massy in his berth next door, raising himself on his elbow, would discover that his second had remembered the name of every white man that had passed through the Sofala for years and years back.He remembered the names of men that had died, that had gone home, that had gone to America: he remembered in his cups the names of men whose connection with the ship had been so short that Massy had almost forgotten its circumstances and could barely recall their faces.The inebriated voice on the other side of the bulkhead commented upon them all with an extraordinary and ingenious venom of scandalous inventions.It seems they had all offended him in some way, and in return he had found them all out.He muttered darkly; he laughed sardonically; he crushed them one after another; but of his chief, Massy, he babbled with an envious and naive admiration.Clever scoundrel!Don’t meet the likes of him every day.Just look at him.Ha!Great!Ship of his own.Wouldn’t catch him going wrong.No fear—the beast!And Massy, after listening with a gratified smile to these artless tributes to his greatness, would begin to shout, thumping at the bulkhead with both fists— “Shut up, you lunatic!Won’t you let me go to sleep, you fool!” But a half smile of pride lingered on his lips; outside the solitary lascar told off for night duty in harbor, perhaps a youth fresh from a forest village, would stand motionless in the shadows of the deck listening to the endless drunken gabble.His heart would be thumping with breathless awe of white men: the arbitrary and obstinate men who pursue inflexibly their incomprehensible purposes,—beings with weird intonations in the voice, moved by unaccountable feelings, actuated by inscrutable motives.","“You may expect some rare fooling with the engines, Jack,” he bellowed.The space into which he stared was deep and full of gloom;

"第八章","VIII "
"二管轮用汽笛声回话以后，马西沮丧地在轮机室上面逗留了片刻。惠利船长凭着五百镑的力量，已经当了三年船长；如果不是这样的话，他可能会被怀疑以前从未看到过这里的海岸。他似乎无法放下他的双筒望远镜，好像望远镜粘在他皱紧的眉毛底下一样。他总是皱着眉头，使他脸上产生一种难以征服的、正直的严厉神情；但是他抬起的肘部微微颤抖，汗水从他的帽子下面不断地淌下来；好像在天顶上那个火热而静止的太阳旁边，还有一个太阳突然燃烧起来，在它们的使人眩目的白热的亮光中，地球像一颗尘埃那样在旋转和发光。","For a while after his second’s answering hoot Massy hung over the engine-room gloomily.Captain Whalley, who, by the power of five hundred pounds, had kept his command for three years, might have been suspected of never having seen that coast before.He seemed unable to put down his glasses, as though they had been glued under his contracted eyebrows.This settled frown gave to his face an air of invincible and just severity; but his raised elbow trembled slightly, and the perspiration poured from under his hat as if a second sun had suddenly blazed up at the zenith by the side of the ardent still globe already there, in whose blinding white heat the earth whirled and shone like a mote of dust."
"他一直举着望远镜，只是时不时地举起另一只手抹去淌了一脸的汗。汗珠从他的脸颊上滚下来，雨点般落在他雪白的胡子上；然后突然间，好像被一阵无法控制的急切的冲动驱使似的，他把手伸到通知轮机间的传令钟台上去。","From time to time, still holding up his glasses, he raised his other hand to wipe his streaming face.The drops rolled down his cheeks, fell like rain upon the white hairs of his beard, and brusquely, as if guided by an uncontrollable and anxious impulse, his arm reached out to the stand of the engine-room telegraph."
"下面的钟当当地响起来。速度慢得要命的有规律的振动，和船上的其他一切声音和震颤都停止了，好像统治海岸的巨大寂静已经偷偷地钻进铁的舷侧，占领了内部最深处似的。明亮而蔚蓝的天空，没有其他的色斑，像拱顶那样笼罩着平坦得没有一点波动的海面；此时，船纹丝不动的错觉似乎一下子从天而降。船航行的时候扬起的微风消失了，好像空气突然变得浓厚起来，动弹不得了；甚至船头前轻微的海水的嘶嘶声也听不见了。狭长的船身向前驶去，不激起一点波浪，仿佛在偷偷地靠近沙洲的浅水区。测深锤投入水里的声音和印度水手那悲哀、机械的叫声间隔得越来越长了。驾驶台上所有的人似乎都屏住了呼吸。轮舵旁那个马来人一动不动地盯着罗盘的盘面看，船长和水手长盯着海岸看。","The gong clanged down below.The balanced vibration of the dead-slow speed ceased together with every sound and tremor in the ship, as if the great stillness that reigned upon the coast had stolen in through her sides of iron and taken possession of her innermost recesses.The illusion of perfect immobility seemed to fall upon her from the luminous blue dome without a stain arching over a flat sea without a stir.The faint breeze she had made for herself expired, as if all at once the air had become too thick to budge; even the slight hiss of the water on her stem died out.The narrow, long hull, carrying its way without a ripple, seemed to approach the shoal water of the bar by stealth.The plunge of the lead with the mournful, mechanical cry of the lascar came at longer and longer intervals; and the men on her bridge seemed to hold their breath.The Malay at the helm looked fixedly at the compass card, the Captain and the Serang stared at the coast."
"马西离开了天窗，拖着脚步，轻轻地回到驾驶台上他刚才站过的那个地方。一丝缓慢的、徘徊不去的微笑暴露出了他那副大白牙：均匀的牙齿在天篷的阴影里微微闪光，好像钢琴的键盘在暮色苍茫的房间里微微闪光那样。","Massy had left the skylight, and, walking flat-footed, had returned softly to the very spot on the bridge he had occupied before.A slow, lingering grin exposed his set of big white teeth: they gleamed evenly in the shade of the awning like the keyboard of a piano in a dusky room."
"最后，他假装极其惊讶地自言自语起来，声音不是很大：","At last, pretending to talk to himself in excessive astonishment, he said not very loud— "
"“现在机器关掉了。我想知道，接下来该怎么办？” ","“Stop the engines now.What next, I wonder?” "
"他等着，驼着背，搭拉着脑袋，眼睛斜瞟。然后提高一点声音：","He waited, stooping from the shoulders, his head bowed, his glance oblique.Then raising his voice a shade— "
"“我要是冒昧地发表一个荒唐的议论的话，我敢说你没有耐性去……”","“If I dared make an absurd remark I would say that you haven’t the stomach to...” "
"但是一个大叫大嚷的兴奋的幽灵，好像一个在海岸那辽阔的寂静中悄悄漫游的疯狂的鬼魂，一下子抓住了那个印度水手的躯壳。他的没精打采的、单调的唱歌似的声音变成了急促而尖锐的喊叫。测深锤盘旋一下，就呼呼作声地飞出去；绳子发出嗖嗖的声音，测深锤急匆匆地在水中溅起一次又一次响声。水变浅了；那个水手不再用昏昏欲睡的声音报告多少英寻，而是叫出了水深是多少英尺。","But a yelling spirit of excitement, like some frantic soul wandering unsuspected in the vast stillness of the coast, had seized upon the body of the lascar at the lead.The languid monotony of his sing-song changed to a swift, sharp clamor.The weight flew after a single whir, the line whistled, splash followed splash in haste.The water had shoaled, and the man, instead of the drowsy tale of fathoms, was calling out the soundings in feet."
"“十五英尺。十五英尺，十五英尺！十四英尺，十四英尺……”","“Fifteen feet.Fifteen, fifteen!Fourteen, fourteen...” "
"惠利船长放下了拿望远镜的那条胳膊。胳膊好像是靠本身的重量慢慢垂下来的。但是他高大的身子的其他部分纹丝不动；那热切的大声警告从他耳旁掠过，他好像没有听见一样。","Captain Whalley lowered the arm holding the glasses.It descended slowly as if by its own weight; no other part of his towering body stirred; and the swift cries with their eager warning note passed him by as though he had been deaf."
"马西一动也不动，留心地听着，眼睛盯着老人那长满银色短发的的镇定的后脑勺。要不是龙骨底下的水深在渐渐降低的话，那艘船好像就止住不动了。","Massy, very still, and turning an attentive ear, had fastened his eyes upon the silvery, close-cropped back of the steady old head.The ship herself seemed to be arrested but for the gradual decrease of depth under her keel."
"“十三英尺……十三英尺！十二英尺！”测深员在驾驶台下不安地喊道。突然那个赤脚的水手长悄无声息地走开去，偷偷地向船舷外瞟了一眼。","“Thirteen feet...Thirteen!Twelve!” cried the leadsman anxiously below the bridge.And suddenly the barefooted Serang stepped away noiselessly to steal a glance over the side."
"他肩膀狭窄，穿一套褪色的蓝布衣服，一顶灰色旧毡帽紧扣在头上，黑黑的颈窝凹下去，四肢细长，从他的背影看，他最多只有十四岁的孩子那么大。他带着孩子气的冲动一样的好奇心，注视着一大片微黄色的旋流从水底盘旋着上升到蓝色的海面上来，好像巨大的黄云慢腾腾地涌上高深莫测的天空。他对这样的景象一点也不惊慌。他不是怀疑，而是确信苏法拉号的龙骨这时候一定搅动烂泥了，所以才向舷侧窥视。","Narrow of shoulder, in a suit of faded blue cotton, an old gray felt hat rammed down on his head, with a hollow in the nape of his dark neck, and with his slender limbs, he appeared from the back no bigger than a boy of fourteen.There was a childlike impulsiveness in the curiosity with which he watched the spread of the voluminous, yellowish convolutions rolling up from below to the surface of the blue water like massive clouds driving slowly upwards on the unfathomable sky.He was not startled at the sight in the least.It was not doubt, but the certitude that the keel of the Sofala must be stirring the mud now, which made him peep over the side."
"他的脸型像中国人，一张老人的小脸，一动也不动，像是陈旧的栎木雕出来的。他的眼睛斜长在脸上，凝视的眼光早就觉察出这艘船向沙洲驶去的航道不正确。美人号出售的手续办完以后，他和其他水手一起结清工资，被辞退了；他穿一身褪色的蓝布衣服，戴着松软的灰毡帽，老是在航运局的门前闲逛，直到有一天，看到惠利船长来为苏法拉号招募船员，他平静地站在了他面前，一双赤脚踩在尘土上，一声不吭地向上瞟了一眼。他从前的老船长的眼光亲切地落在他的身上——这一定是个吉利的一天——不到半个小时，航运局里的白人把他的名字作为火轮船苏法拉号的水手长，写在一个文件里了。从那以后，他就一遍遍地从驾驶台上和沙洲前面看到那个坐落在海边的港湾。视觉世界的经历通过他的眼睛印在他那简单的大脑里，好像通过照相机的镜头印在感光片上。他的认识是可信和精确的。然而，要是有人去征求他的意见，尤其是白人用直截了当而令人惊恐的方式去问他，他就会显出一副犹犹豫豫的无知模样。他对自己经历的事实是有把握的——但是他拿不准怎样的回答才能讨人喜欢，在这样的情况下，对事实有把握也就无足轻重了。五十年前，在一座丛林中的村庄里，那时他出生还不到一天，他父亲（他生前从来没有看到过一个白人的脸）就请一个精通占星术的人给他算出了命宫星宿图，因为根据星宿的排列，可以看出一个人一生的命运。他的命运将来会因为几个航海的白人的喜欢而欣欣向荣。他冲洗过甲板，掌过舵，看管过船泊用具，最后升上了水手长。他那平静的思想，却始终猜不透雇主们那最简单的动机，就像他们那些人也没法探知地壳下隐藏在地心深处的是什么，那也许是火，也许是石头。但是他毫不怀疑，苏法拉号在越过巴都贝鲁的沙洲的时候，偏离了正确的航道。","His peering eyes, set aslant in a face of the Chinese type, a little old face, immovable, as if carved in old brown oak, had informed him long before that the ship was not headed at the bar properly.Paid off from the Fair Maid, together with the rest of the crew, after the completion of the sale, he had hung, in his faded blue suit and floppy gray hat, about the doors of the Harbor Office, till one day, seeing Captain Whalley coming along to get a crew for the Sofala, he had put himself quietly in the way, with his bare feet in the dust and an upward mute glance.The eyes of his old commander had fallen on him favorably—it must have been an auspicious day—and in less than half an hour the white men in the “Ofiss” had written his name on a document as Serang of the fire-ship Sofala.Since that time he had repeatedly looked at that estuary, upon that coast, from this bridge and from this side of the bar.The record of the visual world fell through his eyes upon his unspeculating mind as on a sensitized plate through the lens of a camera.His knowledge was absolute and precise; nevertheless, had he been asked his opinion, and especially if questioned in the downright, alarming manner of white men, he would have displayed the hesitation of ignorance.He was certain of his facts—but such a certitude counted for little against the doubt what answer would be pleasing.Fifty years ago, in a jungle village, and before he was a day old, his father (who died without ever seeing a white face) had had his nativity cast by a man of skill and wisdom in astrology, because in the arrangement of the stars may be read the last word of human destiny.His destiny had been to thrive by the favor of various white men on the sea.He had swept the decks of ships, had tended their helms, had minded their stores, had risen at last to be a Serang; and his placid mind had remained as incapable of penetrating the simplest motives of those he served as they themselves were incapable of detecting through the crust of the earth the secret nature of its heart, which may be fire or may be stone.But he had no doubt whatever that the Sofala was out of the proper track for crossing the bar at Batu Beru."
"这是一个微小的误差。这艘船向北偏移的距离不会超过它自身长度的两倍。白人不知所措的时候总是有原因的（不可能怀疑惠利船长出差错是出于无知，或是技术不够熟练，或是粗心大意），这时他们往往会怀疑自己的理智。马西就是受到了这种感觉的影响，他一动不动站着，露出了牙，焦虑地微笑。那个水手长可不是这样。他才不会为怀疑自己的理智这样的事情而烦恼。要是船长存心搅动烂泥的话，那也没什么不好。他从生活中学到，白人不顾一切地发起脾气来都一样的莫名其妙。他真正感兴趣的只是事情的结果。最后，他显然满意了，终于从栏杆前走了回来。 ","It was a slight error.The ship could not have been more than twice her own length too far to the northward; and a white man at a loss for a cause (since it was impossible to suspect Captain Whalley of blundering ignorance, of want of skill, or of neglect) would have been inclined to doubt the testimony of his senses.It was some such feeling that kept Massy motionless, with his teeth laid bare by an anxious grin.Not so the Serang.He was not troubled by any intellectual mistrust of his senses.If his captain chose to stir the mud it was well.He had known in his life white men indulge in outbreaks equally strange.He was only genuinely interested to see what would come of it.At last, apparently satisfied, he stepped back from the rail."
"他没有弄出一点声音，可是惠利船长好像看到了水手长的那些动作。他直挺挺地抬着脑袋，只是微微地移动嘴唇问：","He had made no sound: Captain Whalley, however, seemed to have observed the movements of his Serang.Holding his head rigidly, he asked with a mere stir of his lips— "
"“还在前进吗，水手长？”","“Going ahead still, Serang?” "
"“还在微微前进，先生。”那个马来人回答。接着漫不经心地加了一句：“船开过去了。”","“Still going a little, Tuan,” answered the Malay.Then added casually, “She is over.” "
" 测深锤证实了他的话；一次次的投掷，水越来越深了，那个兴奋的幽灵，突然离开了那个套在帆布带上、从苏法拉号的舷侧上探出身去的印度水手的身子。惠利船长不慌不忙地吩咐收起测深锤，停止测深，开动机器前进，接着眼晴不再望向海岸，指示水手长保持船在入口的正中央行驶。","The lead confirmed his words; the depth of water increased at every cast, and the soul of excitement departed suddenly from the lascar swung in the canvas belt over the Sofala’s side.Captain Whalley ordered the lead in, set the engines ahead without haste, and averting his eyes from the coast directed the Serang to keep a course for the middle of the entrance."
"马西用他的手掌响亮地拍了一下大腿。","Massy brought the palm of his hand with a loud smack against his thigh."
"“你把船擦到沙洲了。瞧瞧船尾，你就会看到有没有擦着了。瞧瞧船留下的痕迹。你可以清楚地看到。说句良心话，我想到你会这么干的！你为什么要干这种事？你到底为什么要干这种事？你肯定是在设法吓唬我。”","“You grazed on the bar.Just look astern and see if you didn’t.Look at the track she left.You can see it plainly.Upon my soul, I thought you would!What made you do that?What on earth made you do that?I believe you are trying to scare me.” "
"他慢腾腾地，几乎是慎重地说着，那双鼓出的黑眼睛一直盯着他的船长。在他越来越愤怒的声音中，带着一点可怜巴巴的音调，因为，首先他清楚地感到他不该遭受这样的委屈，所以他恨这个人，这个人靠着区区五百镑，签订了三年协定，要分掉他六分之一的利润。当他的怨恨战胜惠利船长这个人引起的敬畏的时候，他就会断然地、怒气冲天地发牢骚。","He talked slowly, as it were circumspectly, keeping his prominent black eyes on his captain.There was also a slight plaintive note in his rising choler, for, primarily, it was the clear sense of a wrong suffered undeservedly that made him hate the man who, for a beggarly five hundred pounds, claimed a sixth part of the profits under the three years’ agreement.Whenever his resentment got the better of the awe the person of Captain Whalley inspired he would positively whimper with fury."
"“你不知道该用什么鬼把戏来把我折磨死。我真没想到你这样身份的人会不顾面子……”","“You don’t know what to invent to plague my life out of me.I would not have thought that a man of your sort would condescend...” "
"只要坐在椅子上的惠利船长稍微动弹一下，他就停住嘴，带着几分希望，又有点胆怯，好像期望听到几句安慰他的好话，要不就是指望惠利船长冲到他面前，把他撵下驾驶台去。","He paused, half hopefully, half timidly, whenever Captain Whalley made the slightest movement in the deck-chair, as though expecting to be conciliated by a soft speech or else rushed upon and hunted off the bridge."
"“我被你搞糊涂了。”他又接着说下去，露出他那大牙齿，不带一丝笑意，神情警惕。“我不知道怎么想才好。我确实认为你在设法吓唬我。你差一点把船搁浅在沙洲上，除了机器里会塞满烂泥以外，至少还会耽搁十二个钟头。如今的船可耽误不起在航行过程中损失十二个钟头——你应该知道得很清楚，而且肯定知道得很清楚，只是……”","“I am puzzled,” he went on again, with the watchful unsmiling baring of his big teeth.“I don’t know what to think.I do believe you are trying to frighten me.You very nearly planted her on the bar for at least twelve hours, besides getting the engines choked with mud.Ships can’t afford to lose twelve hours on a trip nowadays—as you ought to know very well, and do know very well to be sure, only...” "
"他缓慢而流利地说着，斜伸着脖子，从眼角上邪恶地瞟着惠利船长，惠利船长却无动于衷。他严厉地皱紧眉头看着甲板。马西等了好大片刻，然后又开始可怜巴巴地威胁起来。","His slow volubility, the sideways cranings of his neck, the black glances out of the very corners of his eyes, left Captain Whalley unmoved.He looked at the deck with a severe frown.Massy waited for some little time, then began to threaten plaintively."
"“你以为你已经用那份协定把我的手脚捆起来了。你以为你可以喜欢怎么折磨我，就怎么折磨我了。啊！可是别忘啦，还有六个礼拜才到期哪。在三年满期以前，我还有时间辞退你哪。你要是再干出些什么事的话，我就有机会辞退你，我会让你等上十二个月才拿到这笔钱，在你能抽回你的五百镑走掉，不留下一分钱让我买新锅炉以前。你得意扬扬地打着那个主意——难道不是吗？我确实认为你坐在这里得意扬扬地打着鬼主意。好像我为这五百镑出卖了自己的灵魂，最后要万劫不复似的……”","“You think you’ve got me bound hand and foot in that agreement.You think you can torment me in any way you please.Ah!But remember it has another six weeks to run yet.There’s time for me to dismiss you before the three years are out.You will do yet something that will give me the chance to dismiss you, and make you wait a twelvemonth for your money before you can take yourself off and pull out your five hundred, and leave me without a penny to get the new boilers for her.You gloat over that idea—don’t you?I do believe you sit here gloating.It’s as if I had sold my soul for five hundred pounds to be everlastingly damned in the end....” "
"他停顿了一下，并没有表现出明显的恼怒神情，接着心平气和地说：","He paused, without apparent exasperation, then continued evenly— "
"“……锅炉已经快不能用了，眼看就要检查船只，惠利船长……惠利船长，你把你的钱拿去干什么呢？你一定在什么地方存了许多钱——像你这样的人一定有的是钱。这是显而易见的。我不是个蠢货，这你也知道，惠利船长——我的合伙人。”","“...With the boilers worn out and the survey hanging over my head, Captain Whalley—Captain Whalley, I say, what do you do with your money?You must have stacks of money somewhere—a man like you must.It stands to reason.I am not a fool, you know, Captain Whalley—partner.” "
"他又停住了嘴，好像该说的已经说完了似的。他用舌头舔了舔嘴唇，向后瞟了水手长一眼，他正在用低低的声音和微小的手势指挥着船航行。螺旋桨激荡在一片长而平坦的黑糊糊的泥浆水域上，扬起一阵急促的细浪，浪花顶上是深色的泡沫。苏法拉号驶进了河中；它在沙洲上搅起的那条航迹，现在已经落在了航尾后一英里，看不见了，完全消失了。海岸外，平滑的、空荡荡的海面被撇在了身后荒凉闪烁的阳光中。船的两侧低洼了下去，暗沉沉的、弯弯曲曲的红树林覆盖着满是稀泥的两岸。马西突然又开始用他的老调子接着讲下去，就像一摇手柄，八音盒就会奏起音乐来那样，他的话就像是从身子里挤出来的。","Again he paused, as though he had done for good.He passed his tongue over his lips, gave a backward glance at the Serang conning the ship with quiet whispers and slight signs of the hand.The wash of the propeller sent a swift ripple, crested with dark froth, upon a long flat spit of black slime.The Sofala had entered the river; the trail she had stirred up over the bar was a mile astern of her now, out of sight, had disappeared utterly; and the smooth, empty sea along the coast was left behind in the glittering desolation of sunshine.On each side of her, low down, the growth of somber twisted mangroves covered the semi-liquid banks; and Massy continued in his old tone, with an abrupt start, as if his speech had been ground out of him, like the tune of a music-box, by turning a handle."
"“不过，要是有哪一个人比我强的话，那就是你。我不在乎把这话说出来。我说了——好啦！你还想要什么呢？你还不够得意吗，惠利船长？你一开始就比我强。我回想这件事的时候，才发现这是你一个完整的计划。你允许我加上关于酗酒的条款，没说一句话，只是在我一定要白纸黑字写在协定上的时候，脸色很难看。我哪里知道你有什么毛病。人通常总是在哪里有点毛病的。嗨，你瞧！你上了船，原来你许多年来只有喝水的习惯，而不喝什么别的。”","“Though if anybody ever got the best of me, it is you.I don’t mind saying this.I’ve said it—there!What more can you want?Isn’t that enough for your pride, Captain Whalley.You got over me from the first.It’s all of a piece, when I look back at it.You allowed me to insert that clause about intemperance without saying anything, only looking very sick when I made a point of it going in black on white.How could I tell what was wrong about you.There’s generally something wrong somewhere.And, lo and behold! when you come on board it turns out that you’ve been in the habit of drinking nothing but water for years and years.” "
"他的武断的、非难的牢骚停止了。他像一个狡猾而无知的人那样细细盘算着。看到他那张阴沉的黄脸上令人作呕的表情，惠利船长竟然能不笑出声来，似乎太不可思议了。然而惠利船长始终没有抬起他的眼睛——他坐在椅子上，极度愤慨，却神情庄严，一动不动。","His dogmatic reproachful whine stopped.He brooded profoundly, after the manner of crafty and unintelligent men.It seemed inconceivable that Captain Whalley should not laugh at the expression of disgust that overspread the heavy, yellow countenance.But Captain Whalley never raised his eyes—sitting in his arm-chair, outraged, dignified, and motionless."
"“当初我要是加上这么一个条款，凡是没有节制地只喝水的人也可以辞退的话，”马西继续单调地喋喋不休，“这会对我好得多。再说，那天早晨，在律师的办公室里，我读我的草稿的时候，你看起来那么心烦，惠利船长——你看起来那么垂头丧气，当时我确信自己一定抓住了你的什么弱点。一个船主对于他找到的船长是一个怎样的人，知道得再多都不为过。在这段该死的时间里，你一定一直在暗暗嘲笑我……是不是？你怎么说？”","“Much good it was to me,” Massy remonstrated monotonously, “to insert a clause for dismissal for intemperance against a man who drinks nothing but water.And you looked so upset, too, when I read my draft in the lawyer’s office that morning, Captain Whalley,—you looked so crestfallen, that I made sure I had gone home on your weak spot.A shipowner can’t be too careful as to the sort of skipper he gets.You must have been laughing at me in your sleeve all the blessed time....Eh?What are you going to say?” "
"惠利船长只把他的脚在地上轻轻地擦来擦去。马西那斜视的眼睛中明显地流露出阴沉的敌意。","Captain Whalley had only shuffled his feet slightly.A dull animosity became apparent in Massy’s sideways stare."
"“但是别忘了，还有其他辞退的理由哪。什么一贯工作粗心大意，完全不称职啊——长期的玩忽职守啊。我并不像你想证明的那么蠢。近来你一直工作疏忽——把每件事都交给那个水手长。嘿！我看到你让那个马来老蠢货为你校准方位，好像你是什么了不起的大人物，不屑于亲手干你自己的活一样。你刚才驾驶船通过沙洲的时候擦了一下，这你怎么交代？你指望我就这么忍下去吗？”","“But recollect that there are other grounds of dismissal.There’s habitual carelessness, amounting to incompetence—there’s gross and persistent neglect of duty.I am not quite as big a fool as you try to make me out to be.You have been careless of late—leaving everything to that Serang.Why!I’ve seen you letting that old fool of a Malay take bearings for you, as if you were too big to attend to your work yourself.And what do you call that silly touch-and-go manner in which you took the ship over the bar just now?You expect me to put up with that?” "
"斯特恩大副胳膊肘靠在驾驶台后面的扶梯上，努力地听着；同时他一直在向远处的二管轮眨眼睛，二管轮已经上来了片刻，站在轮机间的升降口里。他一边用一团废棉纱擦手，一边漠不关心地看着两边的河岸稳稳地从苏法拉号的船尾向后退去。","Leaning on his elbow against the ladder abaft the bridge, Sterne, the mate, tried to hear, blinking the while from the distance at the second engineer, who had come up for a moment, and stood in the engine-room companion.Wiping his hands on a bunch of cotton waste, he looked about with indifference to the right and left at the river banks slipping astern of the Sofala steadily."
"马西转过身，正对着椅子。他的牢骚又变得带有威胁意味了。","Massy turned full at the chair.The character of his whine became again threatening."
"“当心点。我现在还可以辞退你，把你的钱冻结一年。我还可以……”","“Take care.I may yet dismiss you and freeze to your money for a year.I may...” "
"但是面对着这个静悄悄、直挺挺、一动也不动的人，他的声音渐渐消失在了喉咙里，是这个人及时地带着钱来搭救他，才使他免于破产的啊。","But before the silent, rigid immobility of the man whose money had come in the nick of time to save him from utter ruin, his voice died out in his throat."
"“我并不是要撵你走，”他沉默了片刻，重新说下去，而且是用一种愚蠢的讨好的语气，“我并没有别的意思，是一心要跟你交朋友，续订协定的，要是你同意再弄来两百镑买新锅炉的话，惠利船长。我以前跟你说过。船一定要换新锅炉了；你跟我一样知道得很清楚。这件事你仔细考虑过了吗？”","“Not that I want you to go,” he resumed after a silence, and in an absurdly insinuating tone.“I want nothing better than to be friends and renew the agreement, if you will consent to find another couple of hundred to help with the new boilers, Captain Whalley.I’ve told you before.She must have new boilers; you know it as well as I do.Have you thought this over?” "
"他等着。那个柄很长、斗很大的烟斗从他的厚嘴唇上垂下来。烟斗熄灭了。他突然从牙齿缝中间取下烟斗，两只手轻轻地拧着。","He waited.The slender stem of the pipe with its bulky lump of a bowl at the end hung down from his thick lips.It had gone out.Suddenly he took it from between his teeth and wrung his hands slightly."
"“你不相信我吗？”他把烟斗猛地塞进他那件磨得亮晃晃的黑上衣的口袋里。","“Don’t you believe me?” He thrust the pipe bowl into the pocket of his shiny black jacket."
"“真像跟魔鬼打交道，”他说，“你干吗不说话呢？开始你对我是那么的趾高气扬，我简直在自己的甲板上也不敢蹑手蹑脚地走动。如今我从你那里听不到一句话。你似乎看也不看我一眼。这是什么意思？说句良心话，你那套装聋作哑的花招确实把我吓坏了。你那个脑袋里到底在想些什么？你在一门心思地打什么对我不利的主意吧？所以一句话也说不出来了。我绝不会相信你——你——不知道上哪里去弄两百镑。你已经折磨得我要诅咒自已出生的那一天了……” ","“It’s like dealing with the devil,” he said.“Why don’t you speak?At first you were so high and mighty with me I hardly dared to creep about my own deck.Now I can’t get a word from you.You don’t seem to see me at all.What does it mean?Upon my soul, you terrify me with this deaf and dumb trick.What’s going on in that head of yours?What are you plotting against me there so hard that you can’t say a word?You will never make me believe that you—you—don’t know where to lay your hands on a couple of hundred.You have made me curse the day I was born....” "
"“马西先生。”惠利船长突然说，纹丝不动。 ","“Mr. Massy,” said Captain Whalley suddenly, without stirring."
"轮机长吓了一大跳。","The engineer started violently."
"“如果是这样的话，我只得请求你原谅我。”","“If that is so I can only beg you to forgive me.” "
"“向右转舵。”那个水手长低声地对舵手说。苏法拉号开始沿着河湾拐到第二个河段里。","“Starboard,” muttered the Serang to the helmsman; and the Sofala began to swing round the bend into the second reach."
"“哎！”马西打了个冷颤，“你叫我的心都凉了。是什么让你上这里来的？是什么让你在那个黄昏突然上船来的，话说得挺漂亮，还带着钱——来引诱我？我一直想知道你是什么动机？老实告诉你，你是靠在我的身上过舒服日子，吸我的血养肥你自己。不是那样吗？我认为你是世界上最大的吝啬鬼，要不然为什么……”","“Ough!” Massy shuddered.“You make my blood run cold.What made you come here?What made you come aboard that evening all of a sudden, with your high talk and your money—tempting me?I always wondered what was your motive?You fastened yourself on me to have easy times and grow fat on my life blood, I tell you.Was that it?I believe you are the greatest miser in the world, or else why...” "
"“不。我只是穷罢了。”惠利船长冷酷地打断他的话。","“No.I am only poor,” interrupted Captain Whalley, stonily."
"“注意，照直走。”水手长低声说。马西转过脸去，下巴贴在肩膀上。","“Steady,” murmured the Serang.Massy turned away with his chin on his shoulder."
"“我不相信。”他用武断的声调说。惠利船长没有动。“你坐在那里，像一只吃饱了的秃鹫——活像一只秃鹫。”","“I don’t believe it,” he said in his dogmatic tone.Captain Whalley made no movement.“There you sit like a gorged vulture—exactly like a vulture.” "
"他用空洞而茫然的眼光环顾了中间的河段和两岸，然后慢腾腾地离开了驾驶台。","He embraced the middle of the reach and both the banks in one blank unseeing circular glance, and left the bridge slowly."
"第九章","IX "
"在转身下去的时候，马西看到了徘徊在扶梯脚旁的斯特恩大副的脑袋，看到了他狡猾而自信的微笑、他红色的小胡子和眨巴的眼睛。 ","On turning to descend Massy perceived the head of Sterne the mate loitering, with his sly confident smile, his red mustaches and blinking eyes, at the foot of the ladder."
"斯特恩来苏法拉号以前，在一家比较大的船行里担任比较低的职位。他说，他是“按照普遍的原则”放弃他原来的职位的。在那个船行里职位升得很慢，他抱怨说，而他认为该是他到世界上去碰碰运气，争取发迹的时候了。看来好像那个船行里没有人会去世，或是离职。他们都牢牢地抓住他们的职位，直到发霉。他等得不耐烦了；而且他害怕即使有一个职位空出来，干得最好的人也不一定有把握受到公正的对待。除此以外，他得俯首听命于船长——普鲁沃斯特船长——一个不可理喻的人，而且他认为，这个人由于某种原因讨厌他。很可能是因为他干了不少份外的活。他做错了事，是能够像个男子汉那样接受责备的；但是他也指望别人拿他当男子汉那样对待，而不是总被呼来喝去的，好像他是条狗一样。他毫不含糊、直截了当地要求普鲁沃斯特船长告诉他，他什么地方做错了；普鲁沃斯特船长带着最轻蔑的神情对他说，他是个完美的船员，不过他如果不喜欢他跟他说话的那种方式的话，舷门就在那里——他可以马上离开船上岸去。但是人人都知道普鲁沃斯特船长是个怎样的人。向行里去上诉是没有用的。普鲁沃斯特船长在船行里的影响太大了。尽管如此，他们不得不给他良好的鉴定。他大言不惭地说，这世界上没有什么敢和他作对。当他偶尔听到苏法拉号上的大副那天早晨中暑被送到医院里去的时候，他认为去看看他能否担任这个差事是没有什么害处的……","Sterne had been a junior in one of the larger shipping concerns before joining the Sofala.He had thrown up his berth, he said, “on general principles.” The promotion in the employ was very slow, he complained, and he thought it was time for him to try and get on a bit in the world.It seemed as though nobody would ever die or leave the firm; they all stuck fast in their berths till they got mildewed; he was tired of waiting; and he feared that when a vacancy did occur the best servants were by no means sure of being treated fairly.Besides, the captain he had to serve under—Captain Provost—was an unaccountable sort of man, and, he fancied, had taken a dislike to him for some reason or other.For doing rather more than his bare duty as likely as not.When he had done anything wrong he could take a talking to, like a man; but he expected to be treated like a man too, and not to be addressed invariably as though he were a dog.He had asked Captain Provost plump and plain to tell him where he was at fault, and Captain Provost, in a most scornful way, had told him that he was a perfect officer, and that if he disliked the way he was being spoken to there was the gangway—he could take himself off ashore at once.But everybody knew what sort of man Captain Provost was.It was no use appealing to the office.Captain Provost had too much influence in the employ.All the same, they had to give him a good character.He made bold to say there was nothing in the world against him, and, as he had happened to hear that the mate of the Sofala had been taken to the hospital that morning with a sunstroke, he thought there would be no harm in seeing whether he would not do...."
"他去见惠利船长的时候新刮了胡子，红脸，细腰，挺着瘦削的胸膛，带着坦率而果断的自信态度说着自己微不足道的经历。他的眼睑偶尔轻微地颤动；他的一只手会悄悄地摸摸火红的小胡子；他眉毛挺拔、浓密、呈栗壳色；笔直坦率得近乎冒失的眼光似乎在颤抖。惠利船长临时雇用了他。后来，原来那个大副按照医生的吩咐被送回英国去了，他就一次航行接一次航行地留了下来。现在他已经坐稳这个职位了，他的工作表现带着认真负责、专心致志的特点。一有人跟他说话，他就殷勤地微笑，浑身上下都表现出一种极其顺从的样子；但是他的眼睛一直很快地眨巴着，流露出古怪的神情，好像他掌握着一个秘密的笑话，这个笑话骗过了全世界的人，而别人却猜不透。","He had come to Captain Whalley freshly shaved, red-faced, thin-flanked, throwing out his lean chest; and had recited his little tale with an open and manly assurance.Now and then his eyelids quivered slightly, his hand would steal up to the end of the flaming mustache; his eyebrows were straight, furry, of a chestnut color, and the directness of his frank gaze seemed to tremble on the verge of impudence.Captain Whalley had engaged him temporarily; then, the other man having been ordered home by the doctors, he had remained for the next trip, and then the next.He had now attained permanency, and the performance of his duties was marked by an air of serious, single-minded application.Directly he was spoken to, he began to smile attentively, with a great deference expressed in his whole attitude; but there was in the rapid winking which went on all the time something quizzical, as though he had possessed the secret of some universal joke cheating all creation and impenetrable to other mortals."
"他严肃而面带微笑地看着马西从扶梯上一蹬蹬走下来。当轮机长踩到甲板上的时候，他转过身来；他们发现自己脸对着脸了。两个人个子倒差不多高，可是其他地方完全不同，他们互相看着，仿佛他们中间有什么东西似的——两个天篷中间有一片宽阔的交界处；明亮的阳光从那里照射下来，把甲板上狭窄的铺板横向分开，好像一条小河那样把他们两人的脚隔开；除了那道阳光以外，好像还有什么东西在他们中间似的；那是一种深切、微妙、不可估量的东西，像是无法表达的了解，暗暗的不信任，或是几分害怕。","Grave and smiling he watched Massy come down step by step; when the chief engineer had reached the deck he swung about, and they found themselves face to face.Matched as to height and utterly dissimilar, they confronted each other as if there had been something between them—something else than the bright strip of sunlight that, falling through the wide lacing of two awnings, cut crosswise the narrow planking of the deck and separated their feet as it were a stream; something profound and subtle and incalculable, like an unexpressed understanding, a secret mistrust, or some sort of fear."
"最后，斯特恩眨巴着他那双深陷的眼睛，伸出他那刮得精光、跟脸上其他部分一样通红的下巴，低声说：","At last Sterne, blinking his deep-set eyes and sticking forward his scraped, clean-cut chin, as crimson as the rest of his face, murmured— "
"“你看到了？船擦着了沙洲！你看到了？” ","“You’ve seen?He grazed!You’ve seen?” "
"马西神情轻蔑，并没有抬起他那张肥胖的黄脸，用同样的声调说：","Massy, contemptuous, and without raising his yellow, fleshy countenance, replied in the same pitch— "
"“也许是吧。”不过，要是换了你的话，就会牢牢地陷在烂泥里了。","“Maybe.But if it had been you we would have been stuck fast in the mud.” "
"“对不起，马西先生。我请求表达不同意见。当然一个船主在他的船上可以高兴说什么就说什么。这没关系，但是我请求……” ","“Pardon me, Mr. Massy.I beg to deny it.Of course a shipowner may say what he jolly well pleases on his own deck.That’s all right; but I beg to...” "
"“滚开！”","“Get out of my way!” "
"另一个人微微一惊，也许是抑制着的愤怒冲动了一下，但是他仍然站在那里。马西眼睛向下，东张西望，好像斯特恩在甲板上摆满了绝不能被打破的鸡蛋，而他却在性急地寻找他逃走的时候哪里可以落脚似的。最后他也没有动，尽管有足够可以通行的空地。","The other had a slight start, the impulse of suppressed indignation perhaps, but held his ground.Massy’s downward glance wandered right and left, as though the deck all round Sterne had been bestrewn with eggs that must not be broken, and he had looked irritably for places where he could set his feet in flight.In the end he too did not move, though there was plenty of room to pass on."
"“我听到了你在上面说的话，”大副接着说，“而且你也说得完全正确——老是有些事情出毛病……”","“I heard you say up there,” went on the mate—“and a very just remark it was too—that there’s always something wrong....” "
" “偷听正是你的毛病，斯特恩先生。” ","“Eavesdropping is what’s wrong with @you@, Mr. Sterne.” "
"“我说，你要是能听我说上两句的话，马西先生，先生，我就能……”","“Now, if you would only listen to me for a moment, Mr. Massy, sir, I could...” "
"“你是个偷偷摸摸的人，”马西急急忙忙地打断他的话，甚至快得可以重复一回“一个常见的偷偷摸摸的人”，大副这才能插嘴争辩：","“You are a sneak,” interrupted Massy in a great hurry, and even managed to get so far as to repeat, “a common sneak,” before the mate had broken in argumentatively— "
"“我说，先生，你想要什么？你想要……”","“Now, sir, what is it you want?You want...” "
"“我要——我要，”马西结结巴巴地说，大发雷霆而且感到惊奇，“我想要。你怎么知道我想要什么东西？你怎么敢说这种话？……你这是什么意思？……你在打什么主意——你……”","“I want—I want,” stammered Massy, infuriated and astonished—“I want.How do you know that I want anything?How dare you?...What do you mean?...What are you after—you...” "
"“升值。”斯特恩用坦白得有点虚张声势的调子说，使他安静下来。轮机长那柔软、滚圆的脸颊仍然在微微颤抖，但是他相当平静地说：","“Promotion.” Sterne silenced him with a sort of candid bravado.The engineer’s round soft cheeks quivered still, but he said quietly enough— "
"“你只是没完没了地缠着我罢了。”斯特恩对他充满信心地微笑。","“You are only worrying my head off,” and Sterne met him with a confident little smile."
"“我认识的一个经商的家伙（现在他在世界上已经发迹了） 从前常跟我说，这是个合适的办法。‘永远冲到最前面，’他会说，‘一直呆在你的老板面前。一有机会你就插嘴。让他明白你懂得些什么。缠得他向你看。’这是他的劝告。现在我在这里见不到别的老板，只有你。你是船主，所以在我的眼里，没有别人比你重要。明白了吗，马西先生？我想要发迹。我毫不隐瞒，我是那种一心想要发迹的人。这些人是大可利用的人，先生。你要是还没有发现这情况的话，先生，那你在这一行中还不到家——我敢说。”","“A chap in business I know (well up in the world he is now) used to tell me that this was the proper way.‘Always push on to the front,’ he would say.‘Keep yourself well before your boss.Interfere whenever you get a chance.Show him what you know.Worry him into seeing you.’ That was his advice.Now I know no other boss than you here.You are the owner, and no one else counts for @that@ much in my eyes.See, Mr. Massy?I want to get on.I make no secret of it that I am one of the sort that means to get on.These are the men to make use of, sir.You haven’t arrived at the top of the tree, sir, without finding that out—I dare say.” "
"“为了要发迹，缠住你的老板。”马西咕哝着，好像被这个异想天开的无礼念头吓怕了。“如果这就是你被蓝锚船行的人从行里撵出来的原因的话，我一点也不会感到奇怪。那就是你所谓的发迹吗？你要是不小心的话，那你在这里也会得到那样的发迹的——我向你保证。”","“Worry your boss in order to get on,” mumbled Massy, as if awestruck by the irreverent originality of the idea.“I shouldn’t wonder if this was just what the Blue Anchor people kicked you out of the employ for.Is that what you call getting on?You shall get on in the same way here if you aren’t careful—I can promise you.” "
"一听到这话，斯特恩搭拉着脑袋，沉思起来，不知所措，对着甲板拼命地眨眼。他最近尝试过一切办法，想成为船主的亲信，结果碰了一鼻子灰，只得到了辞退的威胁，除此以外，一无所成；而辞退的威胁马上会抑制住他，使他犹豫不决地安静下来，好像他不确定蔑视这个威胁的适当时刻是否已经来到似的。在这种情况下，他似乎一时说不出话来。马西笨重地挪动脚步，从他身边经过，企图用肩膀把他撞开，但是没有办到。斯特恩避开了，使他的打算落了空。然后他很快地转过身去，嘴张得很大，好像要在轮机长背后喊叫什么似的，但是看起来经过重新考虑后打消了这个念头。","At this Sterne hung his head, thoughtful, perplexed, winking hard at the deck.All his attempts to enter into confidential relations with his owner had led of late to nothing better than these dark threats of dismissal; and a threat of dismissal would check him at once into a hesitating silence as though he were not sure that the proper time for defying it had come.On this occasion he seemed to have lost his tongue for a moment, and Massy, getting in motion, heavily passed him by with an abortive attempt at shouldering.Sterne defeated it by stepping aside.He turned then swiftly, opening his mouth very wide as if to shout something after the engineer, but seemed to think better of it."
"当他寻找发迹的机会的时候，他总是——他很愿意承认这一点——本能地注视他的顶头上司们的行为有什么“可以抓住的把柄”。他相信只要能“使船主们知道真相”的话，那么世界上没有一个船长干得了一天。他这个浪漫而天真的理论使他不止一次地陷入麻烦，但是他仍然不可救药；他生性对人不忠诚，只要来到某一艘船上，他就总是暗暗打主意撵走他的船长、接替他的职位，并认为这是理所当然的事情。他把醒着的空闲时间，都用来幻想诸如精心策划的阴谋和隐私的发现这样的事情——连他梦境中的幻象都是幸运的机会和有利的遭遇。他曾经听到，有的船长在海上生病和死亡；这正是一个聪明能干的大副大显身手的最好时机。有时候一些船长也会从船上跌进水中。他听说过一两个这样的情况。还有人……不过，好像是天生的，他始终相信，他们当中没有一个人的行为经受得起一个“眼光高明”，而且一直“擦亮眼睛”的人的仔细观察。","Always—as he was ready to confess—on the lookout for an opening to get on, it had become an instinct with him to watch the conduct of his immediate superiors for something “that one could lay hold of.” It was his belief that no skipper in the world would keep his command for a day if only the owners could be “made to know.” This romantic and naive theory had led him into trouble more than once, but he remained incorrigible; and his character was so instinctively disloyal that whenever he joined a ship the intention of ousting his commander out of the berth and taking his place was always present at the back of his head, as a matter of course.It filled the leisure of his waking hours with the reveries of careful plans and compromising discoveries—the dreams of his sleep with images of lucky turns and favorable accidents.Skippers had been known to sicken and die at sea, than which nothing could be better to give a smart mate a chance of showing what he’s made of.They also would tumble overboard sometimes: he had heard of one or two such cases.Others again...But, as it were constitutionally, he was faithful to the belief that the conduct of no single one of them would stand the test of careful watching by a man who “knew what’s what” and who kept his eyes “skinned pretty well” all the time."
"在苏法拉号上站稳脚跟以后，他多年抱着的希望大大地强烈起来了。首先，由一个老人当船长是很大的有利条件；按照常理来推测，这种人很可能不久就会出于这样或那样的原因，放弃他的工作。然而，斯特恩发觉这个船长丝毫没有再也干不下去的迹象，不禁大为失望。不过，这些老人有时候会突然就垮下来。于是，那个近在眼前的船主兼轮机长，就会对自己的工作热情和稳健产生深刻的印象。斯特恩决不怀疑自己明显的成绩（他确实是一个杰出的海员）。只是现今光凭工作成绩，一个人是不可能很快就出人头地的。做人一定要有点上进心，还一定要动足脑筋往上爬。他打定主意，只要办得到的话，他就要继承这艘轮船的指挥权；他并不是真正认为当苏法拉号的船长是个了不起的收获，而是因为在东方，最重要的是要有个开端，一旦当上了船长，就会源源不绝地有人请你当船长了。 ","After he had gained a permanent footing on board the Sofala he allowed his perennial hope to rise high.To begin with, it was a great advantage to have an old man for captain: the sort of man besides who in the nature of things was likely to give up the job before long from one cause or another.Sterne was greatly chagrined, however, to notice that he did not seem anyway near being past his work yet.Still, these old men go to pieces all at once sometimes.Then there was the owner-engineer close at hand to be impressed by his zeal and steadiness.Sterne never for a moment doubted the obvious nature of his own merits (he was really an excellent officer); only, nowadays, professional merit alone does not take a man along fast enough.A chap must have some push in him, and must keep his wits at work too to help him forward.He made up his mind to inherit the charge of this steamer if it was to be done at all; not indeed estimating the command of the Sofala as a very great catch, but for the reason that, out East especially, to make a start is everything, and one command leads to another."
"他开始的时候就叮嘱自己，一举一动必须非常小心谨慎。马西的阴郁而异想天开的脾气对他是一种威胁，这种脾气一个人在通常的航海经历中是碰不到的。但他着实聪明，几乎从一开始就发觉他在那里处于一个异乎寻常的环境当中。他那古怪的爱追根究底的想象力使他很快就看透了这个环境；有一种情况使他感到迷惑不解，这更使他心急火燎地想要弄清楚。在这样的情况下，一次航行结束了；然后就是另一次；在他找到一个他可以插手发挥一些作用的机会之前，第三次航行又开始了。这种情况实在很古怪，也很难理解；有一件事情一直在他身旁发生，可它好像被一道鸿沟同船上的日常生活和例行工作隔开了似的，船上的生活和工作同任何其他这类的沿海岸航行的轮船几乎是一样的啊。  ","He began by promising himself to behave with great circumspection; Massy’s somber and fantastic humors intimidated him as being outside one’s usual sea experience; but he was quite intelligent enough to realize almost from the first that he was there in the presence of an exceptional situation.His peculiar prying imagination penetrated it quickly; the feeling that there was in it an element which eluded his grasp exasperated his impatience to get on.And so one trip came to an end, then another, and he had begun his third before he saw an opening by which he could step in with any sort of effect.It had all been very queer and very obscure; something had been going on near him, as if separated by a chasm from the common life and the working routine of the ship, which was exactly like the life and the routine of any other coasting steamer of that class."
"后来，有一天他发现了真相。","Then one day he made his discovery."
"经过这几周的仔细观察和绞尽脑汁的猜测以后，他突然冒出了一个念头，好像一个长时间猜不出来的谜语的答案，瞬间出现在了他的脑海一样。然而，并不像想的那样确凿可靠。天啊！可能是那样吗？他吓得愣住了好几秒钟，试图摆脱这个念头，还一边骂着自己，好像这是对那些不可思议的、无法解释的、前所未闻的疯狂的事情有病态的爱好的人的想法！","It came to him after all these weeks of watchful observation and puzzled surmises, suddenly, like the long-sought solution of a riddle that suggests itself to the mind in a flash.Not with the same authority, however.Great heavens!Could it be that?And after remaining thunderstruck for a few seconds he tried to shake it off with self-contumely, as though it had been the product of an unhealthy bias towards the Incredible, the Inexplicable, the Unheard-of—the Mad!"
"这——这个恍然大悟的时刻——发生在上一次航行的归途中。他们当时刚离开那片叫潘古的大陆上的一个停靠地点，正在笔直地驶离一个海湾。东边，一座巨大的海岬挡住了视野，海岬高高低低地覆盖着茂盛的灌木和多刺的爬山虎，岩石地表那些翘起的边缘露出其间。风开始在帆缆间发出呼呼的声音；沿着海岸的海面绿绿的，似乎比水平线髙出一些，好像在不断地用缓慢的、带着雷鸣般的响声的拍打，把海水泼进处在下风向的海角的阴影里。这片辽阔海面的对面有一群小岛，其中离得最近的那几座被刚才在微风中升起的太阳那朦胧的黄色的光笼罩着。更远处，其他小岛的圆顶从海面上一条条水道中探出来，一动不动地被微风任意吹拂着。","This—the illuminating moment—had occurred the trip before, on the return passage.They had just left a place of call on the mainland called Pangu; they were steaming straight out of a bay.To the east a massive headland closed the view, with the tilted edges of the rocky strata showing through its ragged clothing of rank bushes and thorny creepers.The wind had begun to sing in the rigging; the sea along the coast, green and as if swollen a little above the line of the horizon, seemed to pour itself over, time after time, with a slow and thundering fall, into the shadow of the leeward cape; and across the wide opening the nearest of a group of small islands stood enveloped in the hazy yellow light of a breezy sunrise; still farther out the hummocky tops of other islets peeped out motionless above the water of the channels between, scoured tumultuously by the breeze."
"苏法拉号每一次航行来回经常走的那条航道总要经过那片几英里长的的布满礁石的区域。它行驶在宽阔的水面上，把那些地壳的碎屑一个接一个地撇在身面，那些礁石好像是一队卸下了桅杆的大船，参差不齐地搁浅在一片危险的岩石和浅滩上。这些零零碎碎的陆地，有的看起来确实跟一艘搁浅的船差不多大；另一些很平坦，像停泊着的筏子，像笨重的黑石筏子，静静地被波浪冲打着；还有一些，长着密密匝匝的树，底部是圆的，呈现出一个个满是深绿色树叶的大圆顶；风暴的季节突然刮来的狂风驱使着云影飞驰；一接触到那些阴影，树叶就阴森森地发起抖来。海岸的暴风雨时常出现在那簇礁石的上空；那时候，这一带全都变得黑沉沉，在闪电交加中变得更暗，也似乎更寂静，在雷声隆隆中似乎更不可预料。那些礁石的模糊的形状消失不见了——时不时地完全溶化在密密麻麻的大雨中——又在灰色云层反射出的雷火电光中再次出现，轮廓鲜明而黝黑——星星点点地散布在蓝灰色的圆桌面似的大海上。那些礁石没有被暴风雨破坏，没有被岁月侵蚀，没有被人世的斗争磨损，一直呆在那里，毫无变化，如同四百年前西方人从一艘高船尾的快帆船甲板上见到它们的那一天一样。","The usual track of the Sofala both going and returning on every trip led her for a few miles along this reefinfested region.She followed a broad lane of water, dropping astern, one after another, these crumbs of the earth’s crust resembling a squadron of dismasted hulks run in disorder upon a foul ground of rocks and shoals.Some of these fragments of land appeared, indeed, no bigger than a stranded ship; others, quite flat, lay awash like anchored rafts, like ponderous, black rafts of stone; several, heavily timbered and round at the base, emerged in squat domes of deep green foliage that shuddered darkly all over to the flying touch of cloud shadows driven by the sudden gusts of the squally season.The thunderstorms of the coast broke frequently over that cluster; it turned then shadowy in its whole extent; it turned more dark, and as if more still in the play of fire; as if more impenetrably silent in the peals of thunder; its blurred shapes vanished—dissolving utterly at times in the thick rain—to reappear clear-cut and black in the stormy light against the gray sheet of the cloud—scattered on the slaty round table of the sea.Unscathed by storms, resisting the work of years, unfretted by the strife of the world, there it lay unchanged as on that day, four hundred years ago, when first beheld by Western eyes from the deck of a high-pooped caravel."
"在热闹的海洋上，是可能找到一些隐蔽的地方的，就像在陆地上，有时候你会在一个小村子里遇到一些从来没有被人们的焦虑、贫穷和想法打扰过的房子，好像时间本身已经把它们遗忘了：那片礁石就是这样的地方。数不清有几代人从它的身旁经过；一批批海鸟在明亮的天空中展开长长的、黑压压的、逐渐汇聚的队形，从四面八方急促地飞来，在那些礁石边缘的岩石上睡觉。它们像浮云那样扑动着翅膀飞翔，在岩石尖顶上，在塔尖一样细、圆形石堡一样粗矮的岩石上，在像倒坍的废墟那样的金字塔形的石堆上，在一溜溜光秃秃的圆石上，上下飞舞，那些圆石就像是一堵被闪电击得四分五裂的烧焦的墙——每一个裂口里都有静止而清澈的水的微光。空中充满着连续不断的刺耳的鸟叫声。","It was one of these secluded spots that may be found on the busy sea, as on land you come sometimes upon the clustered houses of a hamlet untouched by men’s restlessness, untouched by their need, by their thought, and as if forgotten by time itself.The lives of uncounted generations had passed it by, and the multitudes of seafowl, urging their way from all the points of the horizon to sleep on the outer rocks of the group, unrolled the converging evolutions of their flight in long somber streamers upon the glow of the sky.The palpitating cloud of their wings soared and stooped over the pinnacles of the rocks, over the rocks slender like spires, squat like martello towers; over the pyramidal heaps like fallen ruins, over the lines of bald bowlders showing like a wall of stones battered to pieces and scorched by lightning—with the sleepy, clear glimmer of water in every breach.The noise of their continuous and violent screaming filled the air."
"从巴都贝鲁来的苏法拉号会遇上这种极其喧闹的鸟叫声；那艘船会在静悄悄的黄昏遇上这种鸟叫声，这是一种被遥远的距离减弱了的野蛮而无情的喧闹声，是一种海鸟在一天将尽准备休息、争夺一个立足点的喧闹声。船上没有一个人特别注意这种声音；这是表明他们这艘船走完了一百英里不变的航程，毫无偏差地到达陆地的声音。船已经走完全程，马上要到达目的地了，直到那些小岛一个接一个地准时出现，那些石尖、那些土丘……还有浮云般盘旋着的海鸟——那片不停飞翔的海鸟发出刺耳的、令人痛苦的叫声，这是令人熟悉的景象发出的声音。下面是崎岖不平的陆地、辽阔的海洋，上面是没有一点阴云的天空，只有这鸟叫声显出了生机。","This great noise would meet the Sofala coming up from Batu Beru; it would meet her on quiet evenings, a pitiless and savage clamor enfeebled by distance, the clamor of seabirds settling to rest, and struggling for a footing at the end of the day.No one noticed it especially on board; it was the voice of their ship’s unerring landfall, ending the steady stretch of a hundred miles.She had made good her course, she had run her distance till the punctual islets began to emerge one by one, the points of rocks, the hummocks of earth...and the cloud of birds hovered—the restless cloud emitting a strident and cruel uproar, the sound of the familiar scene, the living part of the broken land beneath, of the outspread sea, and of the high sky without a flaw."
"但是当苏法拉号碰巧在日落以后靠近陆地的时候，它会发现在夜幕的笼罩下，那里的一切毫无动静。一切都会变得一动也不动，无声无息，几乎什么都看不见——幸亏那些低低的群星是依次隐藏到许多模糊不清的小岛后面去的；在黑暗而辽阔的苍穹下，那些小岛的确切轮廓用肉眼是分辨不出来的。那艘船的三盏灯像三颗星星——红的、绿的，上面那盏是白的——它的三盏灯像三颗在世界上漫游的伴星，在群岛的南端坚持着它们始终不变的航程。有时候，有人会眼睁睁看着它们在暗沉沉的空间顺利地航行，越来越近；一个坐着独木舟在暗礁上漂流的赤身露体的渔夫看到了。他昏昏欲睡地想:“嗨！是那艘一个月一回，往来于潘古湾上的火轮船。”除此以外，他对那艘船就一无所知了。当他听出螺旋桨在一英里半外搅动平静的海水，发出轻微而有节奏的声音来的时候，往往是苏法拉号改变航向的时候，那三盏灯的三色灯光从他面前掉头——消失不见了。 ","But when the Sofala happened to close with the land after sunset she would find everything very still there under the mantle of the night.All would be still, dumb, almost invisible—but for the blotting out of the low constellations occulted in turns behind the vague masses of the islets whose true outlines eluded the eye amongst the dark spaces of the heaven: and the ship’s three lights, resembling three stars—the red and the green with the white above—her three lights, like three companion stars wandering on the earth, held their unswerving course for the passage at the southern end of the group.Sometimes there were human eyes open to watch them come nearer, traveling smoothly in the somber void; the eyes of a naked fisherman in his canoe floating over a reef.He thought drowsily: “Ha! The fire-ship that once in every moon goes in and comes out of Pangu bay.” More he did not know of her.And just as he had detected the faint rhythm of the propeller beating the calm water a mile and a half away, the time would come for the Sofala to alter her course, the lights would swing off him their triple beam—and disappear."
"有一些极其穷苦的人家，他们都半裸着身子，长头发，精瘦，眼睛里总是冒着怒火，像是一伙被放逐的人一样，在那些寂寞荒凉的小岛上挣扎着过日子。那些小岛在海湾的大门口，像是陆地被抛弃了的外围工事。在汊港里，以及迂回曲折的岩石之间，在他们用树干挖出来的歪歪斜斜的有漏洞的独木舟底下，平静的水比水晶还清澈。短桨一拨动，水底的景象微微起伏。那些人好像在空中一样；他们似乎裹在黑黢黢的、湿透了的木纤维中，在浅滩上方奇怪的、摇摇晃晃的、透明的绿色空气中耐心地捕鱼。","A few miserable, half-naked families, a sort of outcast tribe of long-haired, lean, and wild-eyed people, strove for their living in this lonely wilderness of islets, lying like an abandoned outwork of the land at the gates of the bay.Within the knots and loops of the rocks the water rested more transparent than crystal under their crooked and leaky canoes, scooped out of the trunk of a tree: the forms of the bottom undulated slightly to the dip of a paddle; and the men seemed to hang in the air, they seemed to hang inclosed within the fibers of a dark, sodden log, fishing patiently in a strange, unsteady, pellucid, green air above the shoals."
"他们晃晃悠悠地移动着，身子是棕色的，而且很瘦弱，好像被阳光晒干了似的。他们默默地打发着日子。他们出生、休息和死亡的房子——用蒲苇和野草马马虎虎搭起来、加上几张粗席胡乱对付的棚屋——隐藏着，在开阔的海面上是看不见的。在那些小岛上漆黑的夜晚，他们家的熊熊火焰从来不为一个海员点燃一朵红色的火花。海岸的无风期，赤道上漫长而火热的无风期，就像一个性格热情的人屏住气在专心致志地深刻反思那样，仿佛母鸡在孵蛋，多少天，多少个星期一动也不动地坚持下去。不过它的蛋是不会有变化的。直到最后石头烫得像还没有熄灭的灰烬，灼痛光着的脚底；水变得暖呼呼的，有股味道，而且好像变稠了，只淹到那些腰里缠着布的消瘦的男人的大腿那里；他们在白得亮晃晃的浅水里蹚来蹚去。苏法拉号有时会因为在哪个停靠地点多耽搁了片刻，恰巧推迟到中午驶到潘古湾，出现在海面上。","Their bodies stalked brown and emaciated as if dried up in the sunshine; their lives ran out silently; the homes where they were born, went to rest, and died—flimsy sheds of rushes and coarse grass eked out with a few ragged mats—were hidden out of sight from the open sea.No glow of their household fires ever kindled for a seaman a red spark upon the blind night of the group: and the calms of the coast, the flaming long calms of the equator, the unbreathing, concentrated calms like the deep introspection of a passionate nature, brooded awfully for days and weeks together over the unchangeable inheritance of their children; till at last the stones, hot like live embers, scorched the naked sole, till the water clung warm, and sickly, and as if thickened, about the legs of lean men with girded loins, wading thigh-deep in the pale blaze of the shallows.And it would happen now and then that the Sofala, through some delay in one of the ports of call, would heave in sight making for Pangu bay as late as noonday."
"开始只是一片模糊的云影，这艘船稀薄的烟雾，会从清晰的海天交界处一个空白点上神秘地升起来。暗礁里那些沉默寡言的渔夫会把他们消瘦的胳膊伸向海面。小小的海滩上那些弯着的棕色身子会伸直，那些棕色的男人、女人和孩子原来在沙里挖海龟蛋，会胳膊肘弯得老高，手掌横摆在眼睛上面，看这个一个月来一回的怪物笔直地开来，拐弯——开走。他们听到那艘船扑扑的声音；他们的眼睛跟着它，直到它以全速从陆地的两个海角中间穿过，好像它希望能毫无阻拦地一直驶进地底深处似的。","Only a blurring cloud at first, the thin mist of her smoke would arise mysteriously from an empty point on the clear line of sea and sky.The taciturn fishermen within the reefs would extend their lean arms towards the offing; and the brown figures stooping on the tiny beaches, the brown figures of men, women, and children grubbing in the sand in search of turtles’ eggs, would rise up, crooked elbow aloft and hand over the eyes, to watch this monthly apparition glide straight on, swerve off—and go by.Their ears caught the panting of that ship; their eyes followed her till she passed between the two capes of the mainland going at full speed as though she hoped to make her way unchecked into the very bosom of the earth."
"在这样日子里，闪闪发光的海面上不会显出航道两边潜伏着任何危险的迹象。在那压倒一切的亮光下，一切都一动也不动，瘫痪了一般。那些小岛在阳光中全都变得黑沉沉——岩石像尖顶，岩石像塔尖，岩石像废墟；那些小岛的形状像蜂窝，像鼹鼠山；那些小岛叫人想起干草垛的形状，想起攀着长春藤的高塔的轮廓——没有一丝涟漪的水中会映出它们的倒影，就像乌木雕刻的玩具摆在银白色的玻璃镜子上。  ","On such days the luminous sea would give no sign of the dangers lurking on both sides of her path.Everything remained still, crushed by the overwhelming power of the light; and the whole group, opaque in the sunshine,—the rocks resembling pinnacles, the rocks resembling spires, the rocks resembling ruins; the forms of islets resembling beehives, resembling mole-hills, the islets recalling the shapes of haystacks, the contours of ivy-clad towers,—would stand reflected together upside down in the unwrinkled water, like carved toys of ebony disposed on the silvered plate-glass of a mirror."
"天气只要有一点刮风的迹象，这一带马上就会完全被裹在狂风掀起的汹涌澎湃的浪花中，好像裹在一阵突然冒出来的云雾般的水蒸汽中似的。所有河道里的水看起来简直要沸腾了。被激怒的海用愤怒的浪花精确地勾勒出那些小岛的宽阔的底部轮廓。海岸附近的建筑物丢出来的、淹没在水中的破碎的废物和垃圾受到波浪的冲击，危险地奔腾起来，远远地一直冲到海峡里，布满了往往有一英里长的讨厌的暗礁上，泡沫和石头组成的致命的暗礁上。 ","The first touch of blowing weather would envelop the whole at once in the spume of the windward breakers, as if in a sudden cloudlike burst of steam; and the clear water seemed fairly to boil in all the passages.The provoked sea outlined exactly in a design of angry foam the wide base of the group; the submerged level of broken waste and refuse left over from the building of the coast near by, projecting its dangerous spurs, all awash, far into the channel, and bristling with wicked long spits often a mile long: with deadly spits made of froth and stones."
"甚至只要刮一点清新的微风——就像前一次航行那样，那天早晨，苏法拉号很早就从潘古湾开出来，斯特恩先生发现一个情况，这个发现使他心中那颗小小的、天生怀疑的种子，开出一朵形态不可思议的邪恶的花来。甚至仅仅刮一点这样的风，也有足够的力量揭掉海面上平静的面具。斯特恩冷漠地凝视着，对他来说，这好像是一个新发现，他第一次看到海面上那些嘶嘶作响的青灰色的碎片标志的危险，同印刷的航海图一样清晰。他忽然想起，一个对这一带不熟悉的人倒是最喜欢在这样的日子指挥航行的。晴天，那一点风正好使海水冲击暗礁，似乎在向人们清楚地指示航道似的；而在无风期，除了罗盘和有经验的肉眼判断以外，你没有什么可以依靠。然而苏法拉号的历任船长被迫不止一次地在黑夜驾驶这艘船走过这条航道。如今你担负不起让一艘轮船浪费六七个小时的时间损失。这你可担负不起。换句话说，使用才是最重要的，只要多加小心……航道相当宽阔和安全；关键是在黑暗中正确地对准航道的入口——因为一个人要是卷入远处那片波涛汹涌的海水中的话，那他就决不能再把船完整地开出来——如果他还可能开出来的话。 ","And even nothing more than a brisk breeze—as on that morning, the voyage before, when the Sofala left Pangu bay early, and Mr. Sterne’s discovery was to blossom out like a flower of incredible and evil aspect from the tiny seed of instinctive suspicion,—even such a breeze had enough strength to tear the placid mask from the face of the sea.To Sterne, gazing with indifference, it had been like a revelation to behold for the first time the dangers marked by the hissing livid patches on the water as distinctly as on the engraved paper of a chart.It came into his mind that this was the sort of day most favorable for a stranger attempting the passage: a clear day, just windy enough for the sea to break on every ledge, buoying, as it were, the channel plainly to the sight; whereas during a calm you had nothing to depend on but the compass and the practiced judgment of your eye.And yet the successive captains of the Sofala had had to take her through at night more than once.Nowadays you could not afford to throw away six or seven hours of a steamer’s time.That you couldn’t.But then use is everything, and with proper care...The channel was broad and safe enough; the main point was to hit upon the entrance correctly in the dark—for if a man got himself involved in that stretch of broken water over yonder he would never get out with a whole ship—if he ever got out at all."
"这是斯特恩最后一些不受那个了不起的发现所影响的想法。他刚才在负责固定铁锚，这时候仍然逗留在船身前部消磨着时间。船长在驾驶台上指挥。他微微打了个呵欠，转过身去，不再观察海面，肩膀靠在了起锚架上。","This was Sterne’s last train of thought independent of the great discovery.He had just seen to the securing of the anchor, and had remained forward idling away a moment or two.The captain was in charge on the bridge.With a slight yawn he had turned away from his survey of the sea and had leaned his shoulders against the fish davit."
"严格来说，这是他在苏法拉号上经历的最后一些安闲的时刻。从那以后他总是酝酿着某种意图，还总是被混乱的心情折磨得无法忍受。再也没有闲适的胡思乱想了；那个发现让他感到十分痛苦，有时候他甚至巴不得生性愚蠢，压根没有发现这件事。可是话说回来，要是他的机会寄托在发现 “什么毛病”上的话，那他不可能指望有比这更好的运气了。","These, properly speaking, were the very last moments of ease he was to know on board the Sofala.All the instants that came after were to be pregnant with purpose and intolerable with perplexity.No more idle, random thoughts; the discovery would put them on the rack, till sometimes he wished to goodness he had been fool enough not to make it at all.And yet, if his chance to get on rested on the discovery of “something wrong,” he could not have hoped for a greater stroke of luck."
"第十章","X "
"这个认识确实太令人不安了。是出了大“毛病”，开始的时候，他一想到这个确凿无疑的认识的不道德性，就感到毛骨悚然。当时斯特恩带着那么闲适的心情向后看，仅此一次他并没有在想着去伤害什么人。驾驶台上的船长自然而然地出现在了他的眼前。他的那个想法是多么无关紧要、多么偶然，结果却使他发现了那件事情——就像一颗偶然的火花就足以点燃一个巨大的地雷坑！","The knowledge was too disturbing, really.There was “something wrong” with a vengeance, and the moral certitude of it was at first simply frightful to contemplate.Sterne had been looking aft in a mood so idle, that for once he was thinking no harm of anyone.His captain on the bridge presented himself naturally to his sight.How insignificant, how casual was the thought that had started the train of discovery—like an accidental spark that suffices to ignite the charge of a tremendous mine!"
"前甲板的天篷下部被微风吹拂着，向上鼓起，又慢慢瘪下去。在沉重地扑动的天篷上面，惠利船长的宽大的灰色外衣在他的胳膊和身子上不停地飘动。他在亮光中面对着风，银白的大胡子被风吹得紧贴在胸膛上。他的眉毛浓密地突出在阴影上，由此他的眼光像是从阴影中射出来，锐利地盯着前面看似的。斯特恩只能看出他两条突出的浓眉下眼白的闪光。虽然这个人的态度非常和蔼可亲，可是这双眼睛在近处看你，似乎把你的五脏六腑都看穿了似的。斯特恩每次同他的船长说话的时候，总是摆脱不了这种感觉。他讨厌这种感觉。他在上面看起来是个多么笨重的大个子啊，在他近旁的那个水手长活像一只小虾——在这艘离奇的轮船上已经习以为常啦！这个讨厌的、荒唐的习惯。他恨透了这个习惯。那个老家伙当然能照顾好他那艘船，用不着让那个磨磨蹭蹭的土著待在他身旁。斯特恩厌恶地动动脊背。这算什么？懒散呢，还是什么？","Caught under by the breeze, the awnings of the foredeck bellied upwards and collapsed slowly, and above their heavy flapping the gray stuff of Captain Whalley’s roomy coat fluttered incessantly around his arms and trunk.He faced the wind in full light, with his great silvery beard blown forcibly against his chest; the eyebrows overhung heavily the shadows whence his glance appeared to be staring ahead piercingly.Sterne could just detect the twin gleam of the whites shifting under the shaggy arches of the brow.At short range these eyes, for all the man’s affable manner, seemed to look you through and through.Sterne never could defend himself from that feeling when he had occasion to speak with his captain.He did not like it.What a big heavy man he appeared up there, with that little shrimp of a Serang in close attendance—as was usual in this extraordinary steamer!Confounded absurd custom that.He resented it.Surely the old fellow could have looked after his ship without that loafing native at his elbow.Sterne wriggled his shoulders with disgust.What was it?Indolence or what?"
"老船长多年来一定是变得越来越懒了。在远东这里，他们个个都变得越来越懒了（斯特恩很清楚自己的干劲没有受到损害）；他们都懒得散了架了。但是老船长笔直地屹立在驾驶台上；在他身旁很低的地方，就像你看到一个小孩子在桌子边上张望那样，那个戴着破旧软帽的水手长的棕色的脸在白帆布围栏上面向外张望。 ","That old skipper must have been growing lazy for years.They all grew lazy out East here (Sterne was very conscious of his own unimpaired activity); they got slack all over.But he towered very erect on the bridge; and quite low by his side, as you see a small child looking over the edge of a table, the battered soft hat and the brown face of the Serang peeped over the white canvas screen of the rail."
"毫无疑问，那个马来人在往后站，凑近舵轮；斯特恩对这两个大小非常悬殊的人如此密切地呆在一起很感兴趣，好像他正在观察自然界中的一个奇异现象似的。他在心里感叹道真是天下之大，无奇不有。","No doubt the Malay was standing back, nearer to the wheel; but the great disparity of size in close association amused Sterne like the observation of a bizarre fact in nature.They were as queer fish out of the sea as any in it."
"他看到惠利船长很快地转过头来跟那个水手长说话。风一下子把他雪白的大胡子吹向一边。他在指示那个家伙为他看罗盘，或者干诸如此类的事。当然啦。亲自踱过去看未免太麻烦了。斯特恩一想到东方的白人都被肉体的懒散压垮，就对那种懒散更加轻蔑了。他们有些人要是没有那些供他们随心所欲地使唤的土著的话，就会不知所措；他们对这种情况变得一点也不害臊了。谢天谢地，他可不是那号人！他才不会让自己去依靠那么一个干枯的小个子马来人工作哩。好像这世界上有人竟然能信任一个愚蠢的土著去干什么似的! 但是那位别出心裁的老人似乎想法不一样。他们一起在那里，从不分开；他们两个人叫人想起了一条小领航鱼陪着一条老鲸鱼。","He saw Captain Whalley turn his head quickly to speak to his Serang; the wind whipped the whole white mass of the beard sideways.He would be directing the chap to look at the compass for him, or what not.Of course.Too much trouble to step over and see for himself.Sterne’s scorn for that bodily indolence which overtakes white men in the East increased on reflection.Some of them would be utterly lost if they hadn’t all these natives at their beck and call; they grew perfectly shameless about it too.He was not of that sort, thank God!It wasn’t in him to make himself dependent for his work on any shriveled-up little Malay like that.As if one could ever trust a silly native for anything in the world!But that fine old man thought differently, it seems.There they were together, never far apart; a pair of them, recalling to the mind an old whale attended by a little pilot-fish."
"这个异想天开的比喻使他忍不住微笑起来。一条鲸鱼同一条分不开的领航鱼！那个老人看上去正像鲸鱼，因为不能说他像鲨鱼，虽然马西先生这么叫他。但是马西先生在大发雷霆的时候，并不考虑自己说些什么。斯特恩对自己微笑着——“领航鱼”这个词的声音、想象中的“领航鱼”这个词的形状渐渐引起了他的一些联想；他脑子里最先联想到的是援助，是需要和得到的指导。“领航”这个词使他联想起信任、依靠，联想起向海员提供的受欢迎的、眼光锐利的帮助。海员们要在黑夜中摸索陆地，在浓雾中盲目地摸索，在狂风大作的天气里试探着前进，狂风从海水中刮起一阵咸雾，使空气中烟雾弥漫，使四周的视野缩小，水平线近得似乎一伸手就可以碰到。   ","The fancifulness of the comparison made him smile.A whale with an inseparable pilot-fish!That’s what the old man looked like; for it could not be said he looked like a shark, though Mr. Massy had called him that very name.But Mr. Massy did not mind what he said in his savage fits.Sterne smiled to himself—and gradually the ideas evoked by the sound, by the imagined shape of the word pilot-fish; the ideas of aid, of guidance needed and received, came uppermost in his mind: the word pilot awakened the idea of trust, of dependence, the idea of welcome, clear-eyed help brought to the seaman groping for the land in the dark: groping blindly in fogs: feeling their way in the thick weather of the gales that, filling the air with a salt mist blown up from the sea, contract the range of sight on all sides to a shrunken horizon that seems within reach of the hand."
" 一个领航员比一个不熟悉的人看得更清楚，因为他对当地熟悉，所以显得眼光更锐利，只要匆忙地瞥上一眼，就完全知道那里的地形。他能看透汹涌澎湃的大海掀起的、像幕布那样笼罩在陆地上的烟雾，能确实无误地指出覆盖在柩衣似的浓雾下的海岸的轮廓，和那些在没有星光的黑夜中半隐半现、好像半埋在一座浅坟中的航标。他能认出是因为他早就知道。领航员能正确无误地确定航向并不是因为眼光看得远，而是因为他对地形有更广泛的知识，因为船的位置是不是正确无误，可以决定一个人的名声好坏和他的良心是否平静，可以决定把信任交付给他是不是得当，还决定他自己的性命能不能保全；万一出事，很少只是送掉他自己一条命，还有别人的性命，那些性命在这里虽然无足轻重，而在远方却可能受到喜爱，而且有无从知晓的人在眼巴巴地等着他们，所以他们的生命同帝王的性命一样重要。领航员对地形的知识使一个船长宽心和信得过；然而，那个水手长在他异想天开的联想中只是一条陪伴鲸鱼的领航鱼，无论如何都不可能被认为有更多的知识。他怎么可能有呢？这两个人是一起上船的——一个白人和一个棕种人——在同一天。那还用说，一个白人在一周里学的比一个最好的土著在一个月里学的更多。他一直被安排在船长的身旁，好像他有什么用处似的——就像人们说的那样，领航鱼对鲸鱼有用处……但是，有什么用——这是很明显的——有什么用？一条领航鱼——一个领航员——一个……要不是有更多的知识的话，那么…","A pilot sees better than a stranger, because his local knowledge, like a sharper vision, completes the shapes of things hurriedly glimpsed; penetrates the veils of mist spread over the land by the storms of the sea; defines with certitude the outlines of a coast lying under the pall of fog, the forms of landmarks half buried in a starless night as in a shallow grave.He recognizes because he already knows.It is not to his far-reaching eye but to his more extensive knowledge that the pilot looks for certitude; for this certitude of the ship’s position on which may depend a man’s good fame and the peace of his conscience, the justification of the trust deposited in his hands, with his own life too, which is seldom wholly his to throw away, and the humble lives of others rooted in distant affections, perhaps, and made as weighty as the lives of kings by the burden of the awaiting mystery.The pilot’s knowledge brings relief and certitude to the commander of a ship; the Serang, however, in his fanciful suggestion of a pilot-fish attending a whale, could not in any way be credited with a superior knowledge.Why should he have it?These two men had come on that run together—the white and the brown—on the same day: and of course a white man would learn more in a week than the best native would in a month.He was made to stick to the skipper as though he were of some use—as the pilot-fish, they say, is to the whale.But how—it was very marked—how?A pilot-fish—a pilot—a...But if not superior knowledge then..."
"斯特恩终于发现了真相。这和他的想象是完全不符的，震撼了他对诚实的概念，震撼了他对人类的看法。这件大事影响了一个人关于这个世界蕴含的可能性的看法，例如，好像太阳变成了蓝色，用一种新的灾难性的光芒照射人类和自然界。他起初确实觉得想要呕吐，好像他肚子上挨了一拳似的。有那么一刹那，海洋的颜色似乎都变了——在他骨碌碌转的眼睛前显得很奇怪。他的四肢中都有一种短促的、不稳定的感觉，好像地球开始向另一个方向转动了。 ","Sterne’s discovery was made.It was repugnant to his imagination, shocking to his ideas of honesty, shocking to his conception of mankind.This enormity affected one’s outlook on what was possible in this world: it was as if for instance the sun had turned blue, throwing a new and sinister light on men and nature.Really in the first moment he had felt sickish, as though he had got a blow below the belt: for a second the very color of the sea seemed changed—appeared queer to his wandering eye; and he had a passing, unsteady sensation in all his limbs as though the earth had started turning the other way."
"紧接着他自然而然地对这个发现产生了怀疑，这使他多少轻松一些。他喘了一阵气；一切都过去了。但是后来，在那一整天中，他工作的时候会时时突然感到惊奇。他会停下来，摇摇头。他那针锋相对的怀疑心情，和他发现真相时最初的情绪几乎消失得一样快。接下来的二十四个小时里，他都睡不着觉。那绝对不行。吃饭的时候（他坐在驾驶台上为白人而设的餐桌的末座），他忍不住出神地注视着对面的惠利船长，失魂落魄。他注意到那条胳膊小心翼翼向上的动作。那个老人把饭菜塞进嘴去，好像他不知道每天的饭菜是什么滋味，好像他不知道吃的是什么似的。他像个梦游者一样喂自己吃。“这幅场景真令人不好受。”斯特恩想。他还注意到那种长时间神情沮丧、默不作声、一动也不动的姿态，一只棕色的大手松弛地弯曲着，摆在盘子边上，直到他发觉左右两个轮机员惊奇地望着他。他急忙闭上嘴，垂下眼睛，对着他的盘子很快地眨巴。看到那个老家伙坐在那里，真不好受；想到他只要说一句话，就能像炸弹一样把那个老家伙炸得粉身碎骨，就更不好受了。他所要做的只是提高嗓门，短短地说一句，可是那个简单的举动好像跟把天空中的太阳挪个位置一样办不到。那个老家伙极其机械地吃着，可是斯特恩由于神经紧张，那天晚上无论如何也吃不下。","A very natural incredulity succeeding this sense of upheaval brought a measure of relief.He had gasped; it was over.But afterwards during all that day sudden paroxysms of wonder would come over him in the midst of his occupations.He would stop and shake his head.The revolt of his incredulity had passed away almost as quick as the first emotion of discovery, and for the next twenty-four hours he had no sleep.That would never do.At meal-times (he took the foot of the table set up for the white men on the bridge) he could not help losing himself in a fascinated contemplation of Captain Whalley opposite.He watched the deliberate upward movements of the arm; the old man put his food to his lips as though he never expected to find any taste in his daily bread, as though he did not know anything about it.He fed himself like a somnambulist.“It’s an awful sight,” thought Sterne; and he watched the long period of mournful, silent immobility, with a big brown hand lying loosely closed by the side of the plate, till he noticed the two engineers to the right and left looking at him in astonishment.He would close his mouth in a hurry then, and lowering his eyes, wink rapidly at his plate.It was awful to see the old chap sitting there; it was even awful to think that with three words he could blow him up sky-high.All he had to do was to raise his voice and pronounce a single short sentence, and yet that simple act seemed as impossible to attempt as moving the sun out of its place in the sky.The old chap could eat in his terrific mechanical way; but Sterne, from mental excitement, could not—not that evening, at any rate."
"从那以后，他有充裕的时间来习惯吃饭时那种紧张的心情。他本来绝不会相信这种事情。但是他很快就习以为常了；只是拿不准成功的威力能达到什么样的程度，才使他没有产生近乎扬扬得意的心情。他觉得自己像一个人在采用合法的手段寻找一支上了子弹的枪，帮助他一帆风顺地飞黄腾达一样，不料得到的是一个鱼雷——一个没有爆炸的鱼雷，弹头上装有足以粉碎一切的炸药，弹尾上有强大的气压。这样的武器会使持有者忧心忡忡、紧张不安的。他绝不愿自己也被炸死，但是他摆脱不了这样的想法：鱼雷的爆炸一定会使他自己多少也受点伤。 ","He had had ample time since to get accustomed to the strain of the meal-hours.He would never have believed it.But then use is everything; only the very potency of his success prevented anything resembling elation.He felt like a man who, in his legitimate search for a loaded gun to help him on his way through the world, chances to come upon a torpedo—upon a live torpedo with a shattering charge in its head and a pressure of many atmospheres in its tail.It is the sort of weapon to make its possessor careworn and nervous.He had no mind to be blown up himself; and he could not get rid of the notion that the explosion was bound to damage him too in some way."
"起初这种模糊的恐惧使他克制住了自己。现在，他吃饭和睡觉的时候都忍不住把那个可怕的武器带在身边，脑子里一直确信那个武器的威力。这种信念的到来并没有经过深思熟虑的过程，而是一旦他有了这个看法，那些从前他只是冷淡地注意到的大量细节，就一下子在他的脑海中涌现，使他不得不相信这个事实。用深沉的嗓音说话的时候出现的无礼而犹豫的声调，像保护壳一样沉默寡言的态度，小心翼翼的、好像被人监视着的动作，长时间的一动也不动，好像自己注视着的那个人连空气都害怕打扰似的。每一个熟悉的姿势，他听到的每一句话，他偷听到的每一声叹息，现在都有了特殊的意义，都有了起确定作用的含意。   ","This vague apprehension had restrained him at first.He was able now to eat and sleep with that fearful weapon by his side, with the conviction of its power always in mind.It had not been arrived at by any reflective process; but once the idea had entered his head, the conviction had followed overwhelmingly in a multitude of observed little facts to which before he had given only a languid attention.The abrupt and faltering intonations of the deep voice; the taciturnity put on like an armor; the deliberate, as if guarded, movements; the long immobilities, as if the man he watched had been afraid to disturb the very air: every familiar gesture, every word uttered in his hearing, every sigh overheard, had acquired a special significance, a confirmatory import."
"对于斯特恩来说，在苏法拉号上度过的每一天，似乎都充满了证据——无可辩驳的证据。夜晚，下班以后，他会穿着睡衣睡裤偷偷地溜出舱房（找寻更多的证据），也许会光着脚在驾驶台下站上整整一个钟头，像插在附近甲板座孔中的天篷支柱那样一动不动。在容易航行的海域上，一艘沿海岸航行的贸易船上的船长，通常不用一直留在甲板上值班。按照惯例，水手长会代他值班；在开阔的海面上，航线笔直的时候，水手长经常被委托独自照管船。但是那个老人似乎不能安静地待在下面。毫无疑问，他没法睡觉。这一点也不奇怪。这也是一个证据。寂静的、暗沉沉的海上，在轮船静悄悄的扑扑声中，斯特恩突然会听到一个低低的声音在上面神经质地叫起来：","Every day that passed over the Sofala appeared to Sterne simply crammed full with proofs—with incontrovertible proofs.At night, when off duty, he would steal out of his cabin in pyjamas (for more proofs) and stand a full hour, perhaps, on his bare feet below the bridge, as absolutely motionless as the awning stanchion in its deck socket near by.On the stretches of easy navigation it is not usual for a coasting captain to remain on deck all the time of his watch.The Serang keeps it for him as a matter of custom; in open water, on a straight course, he is usually trusted to look after the ship by himself.But this old man seemed incapable of remaining quietly down below.No doubt he could not sleep.And no wonder.This was also a proof.Suddenly in the silence of the ship panting upon the still, dark sea, Sterne would hear a low voice above him exclaiming nervously— "
"“水手长!”","“Serang!” "
"“先生!”","“Tuan!” "
"“你在当心地看罗盘吗？” ","“You are watching the compass well?” "
"“是，我在看，先生。”","“Yes, I am watching, Tuan.” "
"“船在沿着航道走吗?”","“The ship is making her course?” "
"“是，先生。在笔立地沿着航道走。”","“She is, Tuan.Very straight.” "
"“很好，记住，水手长，命令是由你指挥舵手，小心照看，就像我不在甲板上一样。”","“It is well; and remember, Serang, that the order is that you are to mind the helmsmen and keep a lookout with care, the same as if I were not on deck.” "
"接下来，水手长回答以后，驾驶台上的低低的说话声停止了。斯特恩周围的一切似乎变得更没有动静，更没有声息。他微微感到寒冷，因为长时间的一动不动，还有一点脊背痛，，他会偷偷地溜回甲板左边他自己的房间去。他早已消除最后一点怀疑；当初，因发现真相而产生心境混乱的种种情绪，只剩下几分害怕了。倒不是害怕那个人——他只要说一句话，就能像炸弹一样把那个人炸得粉身碎骨——不如说，这是被无法无天的反常的贪婪行为（还可能是别的吗），被为了多挣几个钱而似乎全然不顾良心的准则和违抗老天的意志这样一个疯狂而阴沉的决定，所激起的一种又怕又恨的心情。   ","Then, when the Serang had made his answer, the low tones on the bridge would cease, and everything round Sterne seemed to become more still and more profoundly silent.Slightly chilled and with his back aching a little from long immobility, he would steal away to his room on the port side of the deck.He had long since parted with the last vestige of incredulity; of the original emotions, set into a tumult by the discovery, some trace of the first awe alone remained.Not the awe of the man himself—he could blow him up sky-high with six words—rather it was an awestruck indignation at the reckless perversity of avarice (what else could it be?), at the mad and somber resolution that for the sake of a few dollars more seemed to set at naught the common rule of conscience and pretended to struggle against the very decree of Providence."
"全世界你再也找不到和这个家伙一样的人了——谢天谢地。在这样一个叫人踌躇不决的骗局中有点玩命的派头。","You could not find another man like this one in the whole round world—thank God.There was something devilishly dauntless in the character of such a deception which made you pause."
"他出于谨慎，考虑到其他种种事情，所以一天天地保持缄默。如今，在他看来，还是当初刚发现的时候就说出来比较容易。他几乎懊悔没有当场把事情闹个天翻地覆。但是揭发这么一件可怕的事情……嘿！他自己都几乎不敢正视，更别提向另一个人指出来了。而且和那样一个亡命之徒打交道，谁也不知道会发生什么状况。目标不是把他撵走（他早已跟被撵走差不多了），而是接替他的位置。 尽管这个想法听起来好像很奇怪，但是他可能会为了它拼命。想得出这样一个骗局的家伙，是会脸皮厚得任何事情都能干出来的，可以说他是个敢于反对全能的上帝的人。他是个叫人毛骨悚然的怪人——他就是这么一个人。他完全可能不怕丢脸，厚颜无耻地把这件事情硬顶过去，直到他把他（斯特恩）撵下苏法拉号，而且永远毁掉他在东方这一带的前途。然而，你要是想发迹的话，总得冒一点风险。斯特恩时不时地想到他从前过分胆小，不敢采取行动，而更糟糕的是出现了这样的情况，也就是他现在似乎不知道该采取什么行动了。","Other considerations occurring to his prudence had kept him tongue-tied from day to day.It seemed to him now that it would yet have been easier to speak out in the first hour of discovery.He almost regretted not having made a row at once.But then the very monstrosity of the disclosure...Why!He could hardly face it himself, let alone pointing it out to somebody else.Moreover, with a desperado of that sort one never knew.The object was not to get him out (that was as well as done already), but to step into his place.Bizarre as the thought seemed he might have shown fight.A fellow up to working such a fraud would have enough cheek for anything; a fellow that, as it were, stood up against God Almighty Himself.He was a horrid marvel—that’s what he was: he was perfectly capable of brazening out the affair scandalously till he got him (Sterne) kicked out of the ship and everlastingly damaged his prospects in this part of the East.Yet if you want to get on something must be risked.At times Sterne thought he had been unduly timid of taking action in the past; and what was worse, it had come to this, that in the present he did not seem to know what action to take."
"马西的粗暴、乖戾的脾气实在让人不安。那是整个局面中不可预料的因素。你说不出那种凶暴的、侮辱人的态度后隐藏着什么。人怎么信得过这样的脾气呢。斯特恩并不害怕这种脾气会危害他的肉体，而是非常害怕它会断送他的前途。 ","Massy’s savage moroseness was too disconcerting.It was an incalculable factor of the situation.You could not tell what there was behind that insulting ferocity.How could one trust such a temper; it did not put Sterne in bodily fear for himself, but it frightened him exceedingly as to his prospects."
"尽管他理所当然地认为自己有异乎寻常的观察能力，他现在也已经对他的发现感到不新鲜了。他不再继续去考虑什么别的事情，直到有一天，他突然想到事情是这么明显，不可能谁也看不出来啊。苏法拉号这艘船上一共有四个白人。杰克，那个二管轮，他太迟钝了，除了轮机室里的事情以外什么也不注意。剩下的就是马西——那个船主——那个有切身利害关系的人——他担心得快要发疯了。斯特恩在船上听到和看到的事情太多了，他知道马西为什么苦恼。但是他的恼怒看起来使他听不进去任何谨慎的建议。只要他知道就好了，这正是他想要的事情。但是你怎么能跟那种人做买卖呢？这就像你手里拿着一块生肉走进一个老虎的巢穴。你为了它煞费苦心，他却很可能把你扯得粉碎。事实上，他一直在威胁要这么干。情况是那么紧急，偏偏找不到万无一失的处理方法，斯特恩急得在下面值班的时候扔硬币占卜，在铺位上睁着眼咕哝，一咕哝就是几个小时，好像他在发高烧似的。","Though of course inclined to credit himself with exceptional powers of observation, he had by now lived too long with his discovery.He had gone on looking at nothing else, till at last one day it occurred to him that the thing was so obvious that no one could miss seeing it.There were four white men in all on board the Sofala.Jack, the second engineer, was too dull to notice anything that took place out of his engine-room.Remained Massy—the owner—the interested person—nearly going mad with worry.Sterne had heard and seen more than enough on board to know what ailed him; but his exasperation seemed to make him deaf to cautious overtures.If he had only known it, there was the very thing he wanted.But how could you bargain with a man of that sort?It was like going into a tiger’s den with a piece of raw meat in your hand.He was as likely as not to rend you for your pains.In fact, he was always threatening to do that very thing; and the urgency of the case, combined with the impossibility of handling it with safety, made Sterne in his watches below toss and mutter open-eyed in his bunk, for hours, as though he had been burning with fever."
"像刚才穿过沙洲时发生的那种事情对他的前途就大有危害。他不想被什么飞来横祸连累发迹。马西正好在驾驶台上，他认为那个老人不得不抖擞起精神，显一显本领了。但是他变得很不中用，现在的确很不中用了。甚至马西这一回也敢大胆地数落他了。斯特恩站在扶梯脚旁留心听，听到那个人发牢骚和拙劣地谴责。幸亏那个粗鲁的家伙很愚蠢，看不出事情的原因。然而这事也不能怪他；一个聪明人也得费些心思才猜得出原因。不过，现在是该干些什么的时候了。那个老人的把戏玩不上多少天了。","Occurrences like the crossing of the bar just now were extremely alarming to his prospects.He did not want to be left behind by some swift catastrophe.Massy being on the bridge, the old man had to brace himself up and make a show, he supposed.But it was getting very bad with him, very bad indeed, now.Even Massy had been emboldened to find fault this time; Sterne, listening at the foot of the ladder, had heard the other’s whimpering and artless denunciations.Luckily the beast was very stupid and could not see the why of all this.However, small blame to him; it took a clever man to hit upon the cause.Nevertheless, it was high time to do something.The old man’s game could not be kept up for many days more."
"“我可能因为他干的这种蠢事而送掉性命——更别提什么机会了。”在那个弯腰驼背的轮机长消失在天窗拐角那里以后，斯特恩愤怒地对自己咕哝着。可不是，错不了——他想，但是说出他知道的情况，对他的前途不会有利。正相反，还很可能把他的前途彻底毁了。他害怕再一次失败。他模模糊糊地意识到，在世界上的这一带地方，他的同事们不怎么喜欢他。这真是莫名其妙，因为他从来没有对他们干过什么。嫉妒，他认为是。对毫不犹豫地下定决心想要发迹的聪明人，人们老是有一股怨气。干你的本份去，要是指望马西那个畜生的感激的话，那真是蠢透了。他是个坏种。简直不是人！凶恶之徒！坏透啦！坏透啦！一头畜生！一头没有一丁点人味的畜生，连一点好奇心都没有，要不，他当然会对他的那些暗示多少有些反应……这样的麻木几乎不可思议。在斯特恩看来，马西那恼火的心境已经使他愚蠢得超过了船主们通常的愚蠢了。","“I may yet lose my life at this fooling—let alone my chance,” Sterne mumbled angrily to himself, after the stooping back of the chief engineer had disappeared round the corner of the skylight.Yes, no doubt—he thought; but to blurt out his knowledge would not advance his prospects.On the contrary, it would blast them utterly as likely as not.He dreaded another failure.He had a vague consciousness of not being much liked by his fellows in this part of the world; inexplicably enough, for he had done nothing to them.Envy, he supposed.People were always down on a clever chap who made no bones about his determination to get on.To do your duty and count on the gratitude of that brute Massy would be sheer folly.He was a bad lot.Unmanly!A vicious man!Bad!Bad!A brute!A brute without a spark of anything human about him; without so much as simple curiosity even, or else surely he would have responded in some way to all these hints he had been given....Such insensibility was almost mysterious.Massy’s state of exasperation seemed to Sterne to have made him stupid beyond the ordinary silliness of shipowners."
"斯特恩沉思着那种愚蠢的行为造成的尴尬情况，完全忘掉了他自己。他那毫无表情的、一眨也不眨的眼睛盯着木板铺的甲板。","Sterne, meditating on the embarrassments of that stupidity, forgot himself completely.His stony, unwinking stare was fixed on the planks of the deck."
"在这条浓荫笼罩下的，像森林中的小路那样寂静的河面上航行，震动船体的颤抖变得更明显了。苏法拉号平稳地行驶着，已经越过了满是烂泥和红树林的海岸区。两岸越来越髙，变成了坚固的斜坡，长满参天大树的森林一直延伸到水边。在泥土被洪水冲碎的地方，出现了一个陡峭的棕色缺口，露出许多纠缠在一起的树根，好像它们在地下扭打似的；在空中，交错的树枝被密密麻麻的藤蔓紧紧缠着，仍然在挣扎着求生，它们的树叶混合在一起，仿佛—堵坚实的墙。到处都有一根巨大的黑柱似的东西直上云霄，要不，有一片凹凸不平的空地，好像是被炮弹炸开的，暴露出里面无法穿透的阴暗，原始森林多少世纪以来不可侵犯的阴影。轮机发出的扑扑声有规律地回荡着，好像节拍器在摆动，给巨大的寂静打着拍子。西边那堵森林墙的影子横在河面上。烟囱里冒出来的烟向后面滚滚涌去，在船尾后旋转，给昏暗的河面笼上一层薄纱似的雾霭。河水由于涨潮被堵住流不出去，躺在整个笔直的河床里，仿佛一泓死水。 ","The slight quiver agitating the whole fabric of the ship was more perceptible in the silent river, shaded and still like a forest path.The Sofala, gliding with an even motion, had passed beyond the coast-belt of mud and mangroves.The shores rose higher, in firm sloping banks, and the forest of big trees came down to the brink.Where the earth had been crumbled by the floods it showed a steep brown cut, denuding a mass of roots intertwined as if wrestling underground; and in the air, the interlaced boughs, bound and loaded with creepers, carried on the struggle for life, mingled their foliage in one solid wall of leaves, with here and there the shape of an enormous dark pillar soaring, or a ragged opening, as if torn by the flight of a cannonball, disclosing the impenetrable gloom within, the secular inviolable shade of the virgin forest.The thump of the engines reverberated regularly like the strokes of a metronome beating the measure of the vast silence, the shadow of the western wall had fallen across the river, and the smoke pouring backwards from the funnel eddied down behind the ship, spread a thin dusky veil over the somber water, which, checked by the flood-tide, seemed to lie stagnant in the whole straight length of the reaches."
"斯特恩的身子好像被钉在了那里似的，随着这艘船内部的振动，从头到脚都微微颤抖。从他的脚底下，有时候突然传来当的一下铁器碰撞的声音，冷不防从下面响起一阵嚷嚷咧咧的声音。右面树顶上的叶子映着低低的夕阳的光辉，那些最高的树枝周围的树叶好像自己闪烁出了金绿色的亮光似的。光滑的蓝天好像帐篷顶那样罩在河床上；以蓝色的天空为背景，这些黑压压的树枝显得分外醒目。到巴都贝鲁去的旅客都跪在地板上，忙碌地卷着他们睡的席子；他们打包裹；他们啪嗒一声锁上木箱的锁。一个贩卖小商品的麻子货郎扬着脖子把陶瓶里的最后几滴酒倒进喉咙，然后把它放进一卷毛毯里。跑码头的小贩们悠闲地站在甲板上，三三两两地低声交谈。一个从南方海岸来的小酋长的随从们，一伙宽脸膛的、头脑简单的年轻人，穿着白裤，戴着圆的白棉布帽，色彩鲜艳的莎笼斜绕在他们古铜色的肩膀上。他们蹲在升降口上，嚼着槟榔，嘴唇鲜红，好像在喝血似的。他们的矛堆在一起，围在他们那个光着脚的圈子里，像一捆不整齐的干竹竿一样。一个身形消瘦、脸色青灰的中国人，已经在胳肢窝下夹着一个用树叶包起来的大包裹，热切地盯着前面看。一个流浪的克林人在用一小片木头刷牙，把一口亮晃晃的水从嘴里吐出来，吐在舷侧。那个胖酋长在一张破旧的躺椅上打盹。在每一个河流拐弯的地方，那两堵树叶墙看起来又沿着两岸平行了，那种不可穿透的繁茂的枝叶到了顶上变得稀疏了，变成了无数任意舒展的细长的嫩枝，变成了老干的最上层的树枝长出的纤弱的分支，变成了星星点点的银色浪花般的藤蔓的羽毛状叶丛，高高在上，一动也不动，好像一片朦胧的烟雾。到处看不到有空地的迹象，看不到有人居住的痕迹；只有一个地方，在一个低低的几乎没有树木的地角尖端，在一簇孤零零的细长的灰白水龙骨底下，一座盖在桩上的破旧的小屋遗址出现了，坍毁的竹墙模样很奇怪，好像是被棍棒砸烂的。再向前些，半藏在下垂的灌木底下，一条独木舟载着一男一女和一堆十来个绿色椰子。苏法拉号开过去以后，独木舟还在不由自主地摇晃，好像是在表演大胆的昆虫渡水或蚂蚁搬家的机械装置一样。这艘轮船一路平稳地向上游驶去，船头在两边冲出两道同整个河面一样宽的透亮的水波，两道水波的外侧那头碰到两岸水中的烂泥，激起翻腾的棕色泡沫，发出轻微的响声。","Sterne’s body, as if rooted on the spot, trembled slightly from top to toe with the internal vibration of the ship; from under his feet came sometimes a sudden clang of iron, the noisy burst of a shout below; to the right the leaves of the tree-tops caught the rays of the low sun, and seemed to shine with a golden green light of their own shimmering around the highest boughs which stood out black against a smooth blue sky that seemed to droop over the bed of the river like the roof of a tent.The passengers for Batu Beru, kneeling on the planks, were engaged in rolling their bedding of mats busily; they tied up bundles, they snapped the locks of wooden chests.A pockmarked peddler of small wares threw his head back to drain into his throat the last drops out of an earthenware bottle before putting it away in a roll of blankets.Knots of traveling traders standing about the deck conversed in low tones; the followers of a small Rajah from down the coast, broad-faced, simple young fellows in white drawers and round white cotton caps with their colored sarongs twisted across their bronze shoulders, squatted on their hams on the hatch, chewing betel with bright red mouths as if they had been tasting blood.Their spears, lying piled up together within the circle of their bare toes, resembled a casual bundle of dry bamboos; a thin, livid Chinaman, with a bulky package wrapped up in leaves already thrust under his arm, gazed ahead eagerly; a wandering Kling rubbed his teeth with a bit of wood, pouring over the side a bright stream of water out of his lips; the fat Rajah dozed in a shabby deck-chair,—and at the turn of every bend the two walls of leaves reappeared running parallel along the banks, with their impenetrable solidity fading at the top to a vaporous mistiness of countless slender twigs growing free, of young delicate branches shooting from the topmost limbs of hoary trunks, of feathery heads of climbers like delicate silver sprays standing up without a quiver.There was not a sign of a clearing anywhere; not a trace of human habitation, except when in one place, on the bare end of a low point under an isolated group of slender tree-ferns, the jagged, tangled remnants of an old hut on piles appeared with that peculiar aspect of ruined bamboo walls that look as if smashed with a club.Farther on, half hidden under the drooping bushes, a canoe containing a man and a woman, together with a dozen green cocoanuts in a heap, rocked helplessly after the Sofala had passed, like a navigating contrivance of venturesome insects, of traveling ants; while two glassy folds of water streaming away from each bow of the steamer across the whole width of the river ran with her up stream smoothly, fretting their outer ends into a brown whispering tumble of froth against the miry foot of each bank."
"“我一定要，”斯特恩想，“让马西那个畜生心里明白。这终究太荒唐了。那个老头就在那上面，埋在他那张椅子里——不管他在世界上还有什么用处，他还是躺在坟墓里的好——而那个水手长却在指挥。因为他是奉命这么做的。指挥。按理说那该是我的位置。我一定要让那个粗鲁的畜生心里明白。我马上就去办这件事，还要……”","“I must,” thought Sterne, “bring that brute Massy to his bearings.It’s getting too absurd in the end.Here’s the old man up there buried in his chair—he may just as well be in his grave for all the use he’ll ever be in the world—and the Serang’s in charge.Because that’s what he is.In charge.In the place that’s mine by rights.I must bring that savage brute to his bearings.I’ll do it at once, too...” "
"当那个大副突然走过去的时候，一个半裸着棕色身子，长着一双大大的黑眼睛，脖子上用链子挂着一道护身符的小男孩，顿时吓坏了。他丢掉了正在嚼着的香蕉，跑到一个庄严的深皮肤阿拉伯人的膝盖前，那个人穿着飘拂的长袍，像一个《圣经》中的人物, 不相称地坐在一个用弯曲的藤条扎起来的黄色铁皮箱上。孩子的父亲冷静地伸出手去，带着保护的神态拍了拍那个剃光的小脑袋。","When the mate made an abrupt start, a little brown half-naked boy, with large black eyes, and the string of a written charm round his neck, became panic-struck at once.He dropped the banana he had been munching, and ran to the knee of a grave dark Arab in flowing robes, sitting like a Biblical figure, incongruously, on a yellow tin trunk corded with a rope of twisted rattan.The father, unmoved, put out his hand to pat the little shaven poll protectingly."
"第十一章","XI "
"斯特恩沿着轮机长的路线走过甲板。杰克，那个二管轮，后退到轮机室的扶梯下，他仍然在擦手，肮脏而冷酷的脸上露出了雪白的牙齿，对自己装出一副让人费解的笑嘻嘻的神情。哪里都看不到马西。他一定直接回他的舱房了。斯特恩轻轻地敲敲门，然后把他的嘴唇凑到通气孔的圆花窗上，说: ","Sterne crossed the deck upon the track of the chief engineer.Jack, the second, retreating backwards down the engine-room ladder, and still wiping his hands, treated him to an incomprehensible grin of white teeth out of his grimy hard face; Massy was nowhere to be seen.He must have gone straight into his berth.Sterne scratched at the door softly, then, putting his lips to the rose of the ventilator, said— "
"“我一定要跟你说话，马西先生。就给我一两分钟时间。”","“I must speak to you, Mr. Massy.Just give me a minute or two.” "
"“我很忙。从我房门前走开。” ","“I am busy.Go away from my door.” "
"“可是请求你，马西先生……”","“But pray, Mr. Massy...” "
"“你走开。听到了吗？滚到别处去——到船的另一头去——离我远远的……”里面的声音低了下去，“见鬼去吧。” ","“You go away.D’you hear?Take yourself off altogether—to the other end of the ship—quite away...” The voice inside dropped low.“To the devil.” "
"斯特恩停顿了一下，接着很轻地说： ","Sterne paused: then very quietly— "
"“事情相当紧迫。您什么时候有空，先生？”","“It’s rather pressing.When do you think you will be at liberty, sir?” "
"对这话的回答是一声恼火的“永远没空”。斯特恩脸上顿时显出坚决的表情，扭动了门把。","The answer to this was an exasperated “Never”; and at once Sterne, with a very firm expression of face, turned the handle."
"马西先生的睡舱——一个狭窄的单床舱房——弥漫着浓烈的肥皂味，呈现出一种经过打扫和收拾之后朴素的整洁模样，并没有寒酸到一无所有的程度，也没有严肃到缺乏人情味的地步，像公立医院的病房那样，或者说（因为它面积小）像一个穷得走投无路、但是品行端正的人的干净的容身之所。舱壁上没有装饰的相框，铜钩上也没有挂一件衣服、一顶多余的帽子。舱内完全漆着朴素的淡蓝色。两个海员用的大贮物箱用帆布盖着，锁着铁挂锁，端正地摆在铺位底下的那片空间里。舱房的四个角落都没有遮掩，一眼就能看到房间里所有的地板条。奇怪的是看不到通常有的沙发。脸盆架的柚木顶盖似乎严实地盖着；从床铺放脚那一头的隔板上突出来的书桌顶盖好像也严实地盖着。床上，一条已经磨薄的、褪色的红条纹毛毯盖在薄得像煎饼那样的褥子上，还有一顶折叠的蚊帐，那是准备在港口过夜时用的。到处都看不见一点纸片，地板上没有皮靴，没有一样乱丢的东西，任何地方都没有一点灰尘，甚至没有丝毫烟灰，他是个烟瘾很大的人，这简直像是一个极度虚伪的现象，让人反感。那张陈旧的木制扶手椅（那里唯一的椅子）因为长时间的使用而闪闪发亮，好像这件寒酸的家具闪着上过蜡的亮光似的。岸上的树叶组成的屏幕在左舷的圆孔中闪过，好像在不停地展现似的，使这个舱房笼罩在不断闪动的光和影交织而成的网中。 ","Mr. Massy’s stateroom—a narrow, one-berth cabin—smelt strongly of soap, and presented to view a swept, dusted, unadorned neatness, not so much bare as barren, not so much severe as starved and lacking in humanity, like the ward of a public hospital, or rather (owing to the small size) like the clean retreat of a desperately poor but exemplary person.Not a single photograph frame ornamented the bulkheads; not a single article of clothing, not as much as a spare cap, hung from the brass hooks.All the inside was painted in one plain tint of pale blue; two big sea-chests in sailcloth covers and with iron padlocks fitted exactly in the space under the bunk.One glance was enough to embrace all the strip of scrubbed planks within the four unconcealed corners.The absence of the usual settee was striking; the teak-wood top of the washing-stand seemed hermetically closed, and so was the lid of the writing-desk, which protruded from the partition at the foot of the bed-place, containing a mattress as thin as a pancake under a threadbare blanket with a faded red stripe, and a folded mosquito-net against the nights spent in harbor.There was not a scrap of paper anywhere in sight, no boots on the floor, no litter of any sort, not a speck of dust anywhere; no traces of pipe-ash even, which, in a heavy smoker, was morally revolting, like a manifestation of extreme hypocrisy; and the bottom of the old wooden arm-chair (the only seat there), polished with much use, shone as if its shabbiness had been waxed.The screen of leaves on the bank, passing as if unrolled endlessly in the round opening of the port, sent a wavering network of light and shade into the place."
"斯特恩一只手扶着门，一边把脑袋和肩膀伸进来。面对这样让人惊奇的闯入，马西无言以对地跳起身来，他刚才根本什么都没干。","Sterne, holding the door open with one hand, had thrust in his head and shoulders.At this amazing intrusion Massy, who was doing absolutely nothing, jumped up speechless."
"“别骂人，”斯特恩急急忙忙地低声说，“我不愿挨骂。我不是为了别的，而是为你好，马西先生。”","“Don’t call names,” murmured Sterne hurriedly.“I won’t be called names.I think of nothing but your good, Mr. Massy.” "
"接着两个人好像是由于极端惊奇而停顿了一下。他们两人似乎都说不出话来了。然后，那个大副继续小心翼翼地说起了花言巧语。","A pause as of extreme astonishment followed.They both seemed to have lost their tongues.Then the mate went on with a discreet glibness."
"“你简直没法想象你的船上出了什么事。你无论如何也想不出。你太好了——太——太正直了，马西先生，不可能怀疑有人能干出这么一件……这件事足以叫你毛骨悚然。”","“You simply couldn’t conceive what’s going on on board your ship.It wouldn’t enter your head for a moment.You are too good—too—too upright, Mr. Massy, to suspect anybody of such a...It’s enough to make your hair stand on end.” "
"他留意着这些话的效果：马西好像愣住了，压根没有听懂。他只是用手掌摸着他横粘在头顶上的那几根稀疏、乌黑的头发。  斯特恩突然改变声调，用一种推心置腹、胆大妄为的口气急忙说下去。","He watched for the effect: Massy seemed dazed, uncomprehending.He only passed the palm of his hand on the coal-black wisps plastered across the top of his head.In a tone suddenly changed to confidential audacity Sterne hastened on."
"“别忘了只剩下六个礼拜时间了……”另一个人毫无表情地看着他，“无论如何，不久以后你就需要另一个船长来指挥这艘船了。”","“Remember that there’s only six weeks left to run...” The other was looking at him stonily...“so anyhow you shall require a captain for the ship before long.” "
"好像只有这个建议才像火红的烙铁一样灼伤了马西的皮肉，他大吃一惊，似乎要尖叫了。他好不容易才克制住了自己。 ","Then only, as if that suggestion had scarified his flesh in the manner of red-hot iron, Massy gave a start and seemed ready to shriek.He contained himself by a great effort."
"“需要一个船长，”他缓慢而尖刻地重复道，“谁需要一个船长？你竟然敢说我需要一个像你们那样的、惯于欺骗的水手来照管我的船。多年来你和你那一伙人靠我的钱养肥了。如果把我的钱扔在水里，我的心里倒好受一些。惯——坏——了的、不——中——用的骗—骗—骗子。这艘老船和你们当中最髙明的人几乎知道得一样多。”他格格作响地咬着牙齿，从牙齿缝里咆哮道，“这愚蠢的法律需要一个船长。”","“Require a captain,” he repeated with scathing slowness.“Who requires a captain?You dare to tell me that I need any of you humbugging sailors to run my ship.You and your likes have been fattening on me for years.It would have hurt me less to throw my money overboard.Pam—pe—red us—e—less f-f-f-frauds.The old ship knows as much as the best of you.” He snapped his teeth audibly and growled through them, “The silly law requires a captain.” "
"这时候斯特恩也鼓起了勇气。","Sterne had taken heart of grace meantime."
"“还有愚蠢的保险公司的人，”他轻轻地说，“但是别管那些。我想问的是：我为什么不能干这个活呢，先生？我并没有说过，你指挥一艘船在世界上航行，不如我们任何一个海员。我并不会装模作样地对你说这是一门了不起的本领……”他放肆地发出一阵短促、空洞的狂笑……“我并没有制订过法律——可是法律已经在那里了，然而我是个机灵的年轻人！我很赞成你的想法；现在我知道你的作风了，马西先生。我不会想方设法地摆架子，像在那里的那个——那个——老人那样，成为懒骨头的。”","“And the silly insurance people too, as well,” he said lightly.“But never mind that.What I want to ask is: Why shouldn’t @I@ do, sir?I don’t say but you could take a steamer about the world as well as any of us sailors.I don’t pretend to tell @you@ that it is a very great trick...” He emitted a short, hollow guffaw, familiarly …“I didn’t make the law—but there it is; and I am an active young fellow!I quite hold with your ideas; I know your ways by this time, Mr. Massy.I wouldn’t try to give myself airs like that—that—er lazy specimen of an old man up there.” "
"他很明显地强调最后那句话，把马西从这条思路上引开，万一……但是他并不怀疑，现在自己已经大有成功的希望了。轮机长似乎困惑了，好像一个动作迟钝的人被要求去抓住某种旋转的东西似的。","He put a marked emphasis on the last sentence, to lead Massy away from the track in case...but he did not doubt of now holding his success.The chief engineer seemed nonplused, like a slow man invited to catch hold of a whirligig of some sort."
"“你想要的，先生，是一个不会任性胡来的人，一个满足于做你的领航员的人。这个想法很正确。哦，我跟那个水手长一样适合干这个活。因为事情实际上就是这样的。你知道吗，先生，是那个像猴子似的马来人在照管着你的船——而不是别人。你听，他的脚在咱们上面的驾驶台上卜卜地来回走——真正管事的船员。他在指挥着船向上游开去，而那个大人物却埋在椅子里——也许睡着了。即使他睡着了，情况也不会糟多少——你完全可以相信我的话。”","“What you want, sir, is a chap with no nonsense about him, who would be content to be your sailing-master.Quite right, too.Well, I am fit for the work as much as that Serang.Because that’s what it amounts to.Do you know, sir, that a dam’ Malay like a monkey is in charge of your ship—and no one else.Just listen to his feet pit-patting above us on the bridge—real officer in charge.He’s taking her up the river while the great man is wallowing in the chair—perhaps asleep; and if he is, that would not make it much worse either—take my word for it.” "
"他试着把身子再伸进舱房一些。马西搭拉着额头，一只手紧紧抓着扶手椅背，一动不动。","He tried to thrust himself farther in.Massy, with lowered forehead, one hand grasping the back of the arm-chair, did not budge."
"“你认为，先生，那个人用他的协定把你捆住了……”马西一听到这话，抬起阴沉沉的脸，正要怒骂……“得了，先生，船上的人免不了会听到这件事情。这压根不是什么秘密。再说，这件事人们在岸上也谈了好多年了；大伙还拿这事打赌。他捆不住你，先生！是你已经掌握住他，他完全任凭你摆布了。你会说你不能因为他懒散就解雇他。这在法庭上很难证明，等等。嘿，这话很对。但是，只要您吩咐，先生，我可以告诉你关于他懒散的原因，使你有充足的理由立刻解雇他，让我在这次未完成的航行中指挥这艘船——就是这样，先生，在咱们离开巴都贝鲁以前——还要让他每天付一块钱的伙食费，直到咱们回去，你要是喜欢这么干的话。你认为怎么样？说吧，先生。吩咐吧。你的时间确实很宝贵，我只要你的口头许诺就行。你的一句明确的话将会和一份契约一样管用。”","“You think, sir, that the man has got you tight in his agreement...” Massy raised a heavy snarling face at this...“Well, sir, one can’t help hearing of it on board.It’s no secret.And it has been the talk on shore for years; fellows have been making bets about it.No, sir!It’s @you@ who have got him at your mercy.You will say that you can’t dismiss him for indolence.Difficult to prove in court, and so on.Why, yes.But if you say the word, sir, I can tell you something about his indolence that will give you the clear right to fire him out on the spot and put me in charge for the rest of this very trip—yes, sir, before we leave Batu Beru—and make him pay a dollar a day for his keep till we get back, if you like.Now, what do you think of that?Come, sir.Say the word.It’s really well worth your while, and I am quite ready to take your bare word.A definite statement from you would be as good as a bond.” "
"他的眼睛开始发光了。他一个劲地催着。一句简单的话——他暗自想着，他就会设法占住这个职位，想占多久就占多久，只要他愿意。他会使自己变成不可缺少的人。这艘船在它的港口名声很坏。它很容易就会把大家吓跑的。马西就不得不一直用着他。","His eyes began to shine.He insisted.A simple statement,—and he thought to himself that he would manage somehow to stick in his berth as long as it suited him.He would make himself indispensable; the ship had a bad name in her port; it would be easy to scare the fellows off.Massy would have to keep him."
"“我的一句明确的话就够了。”马西慢腾腾地重复道。","“A definite statement from me would be enough,” Massy repeated slowly."
"“是，先生。是这样。”斯特恩高兴地翘起下巴，凑近去眨巴着眼睛，带着一种无意识的厚颜无耻，这使马西气得快要疯了。","“Yes, sir.It would.” Sterne stuck out his chin cheerily and blinked at close quarters with that unconscious impudence which had the power to enrage Massy beyond anything."
" 轮机长很清楚地说：","The engineer spoke very distinctly."
"“你好好听着，斯特恩先生：不管你能告诉我什么，我不会——你听到了吗？——我不会答应给你一丁点好处的。” ","“Listen well to me, then, Mr. Sterne: I wouldn’t—d’ye hear?—I wouldn’t promise you the value of two pence for anything @you@ can tell me.” "
"马西狠狠一拳，把斯特恩的胳膊打开，抓住门把，把门拉上。门砰的一声关上，声音响得可怕，他眼前的舱房瞬间暗了下来，好像经过一次爆炸似的。他马上跌进扶手椅里。“啊，别！你别这样! ”他有气无力地低声说。","He struck Sterne’s arm away with a smart blow, and catching hold of the handle pulled the door to.The terrific slam darkened the cabin instantaneously to his eye as if after the flash of an explosion.At once he dropped into the chair.“Oh, no!You don’t!” he whispered faintly."
" 这时候，船驶到了一个离岸很近的地方，左舷外闪过的树叶墙仿佛倚在港口上的百叶窗。黑压压的原始森林，似乎把幽暗和潮湿的泥土上的腐烂的树叶味道送进了这个没有什么家具的舱房——暴雨过后，没有翻动过的泥土毫无遮盖地散发出强烈的土腥味。旁边的一簇簇灌木发出响亮的嗖嗖声。上面是一连串毕毕剥剥的声音，断裂的细枝像阵雨般落在驾驶台上。一根藤蔓缠在吊艇柱头上，发出剧烈的沙沙声，啪地一下拉断了。一条长长的、长满绿叶的嫩枝实际上从左舷的圆孔外一下子伸进来，又退了出去，在马西的毛毯上留下几片忽然就一动也不动的、破损了的树叶。然后，那艘船在河中突然转向，亮光又开始照起来，但是并没有亮得超过光线柔和的程度，因为太阳已经很低了，那条河弯弯曲曲地流着，穿过许多老树，好像在一个陡峭的峡谷底部似的，已经笼罩着越来越深的阴暗——这是来势迅速的黑夜的先驱。 ","The ship had in that place to shave the bank so close that the gigantic wall of leaves came gliding like a shutter against the port; the darkness of the primeval forest seemed to flow into that bare cabin with the odor of rotting leaves, of sodden soil—the strong muddy smell of the living earth steaming uncovered after the passing of a deluge.The bushes swished loudly alongside; above there was a series of crackling sounds, with a sharp rain of small broken branches falling on the bridge; a creeper with a great rustle snapped on the head of a boat davit, and a long, luxuriant green twig actually whipped in and out of the open port, leaving behind a few torn leaves that remained suddenly at rest on Mr. Massy’s blanket.Then, the ship sheering out in the stream, the light began to return but did not augment beyond a subdued clearness: for the sun was very low already, and the river, wending its sinuous course through a multitude of secular trees as if at the bottom of a precipitous gorge, had been already invaded by a deepening gloom—the swift precursor of the night."
"“啊，别，你别这样!”那个轮机长又开始咕哝了。他的嘴唇几乎觉察不到地颤抖着；他的双手也是，微微有一点颤抖。为了使他自己能平静下来，他揭开书桌盖，铺开一张淡灰色的薄纸，开始仔细地看那上面印着的大量数字。在这次航程中，他至少看了二十遍了。","“Oh, no, you don’t!” murmured the engineer again.His lips trembled almost imperceptibly; his hands too, a little: and to calm himself he opened the writing-desk, spread out a sheet of thin grayish paper covered with a mass of printed figures and began to scan them attentively for the twentieth time this trip at least."
"他的胳膊肘撑着，双手捧着头，好像在出神地研究着一个深奥的数学问题。那是上一次彩票大奖的得奖号码单，多少年来，在他的生活中只有彩票开奖才能使他心情振奋。每隔一定的时间，他就会有这样一张纸。在他的心里，生活中永远不可能没有这种纸，就像另外一个人按照他的天性，无法想象居然可能有一个没有新鲜空气、没有活动、没有爱情的世界。几年来，他书桌里的那堆薄纸越来越厚，而苏法拉号在忠心耿耿的杰克照管轮机之下，来回行驶，从一个海角到另一个海角，从一条河到另一条河，从一个海湾到另一个海湾，把锅炉都快用坏了。全靠着那艘使用过度、得不到维修的船拼命工作，才累积起来了这一大堆发黑的单子。马西把它们当财宝锁起来。在那些单子中，有着在生活经历中隐藏的对希望的迷恋，有着对无从知晓的事情猜对了一半而产生的兴奋心情，有着对满足了一半的欲望的向往。","With his elbows propped, his head between his hands, he seemed to lose himself in the study of an abstruse problem in mathematics.It was the list of the winning numbers from the last drawing of the great lottery which had been the one inspiring fact of so many years of his existence.The conception of a life deprived of that periodical sheet of paper had slipped away from him entirely, as another man, according to his nature, would not have been able to conceive a world without fresh air, without activity, or without affection.A great pile of flimsy sheets had been growing for years in his desk, while the Sofala, driven by the faithful Jack, wore out her boilers in tramping up and down the Straits, from cape to cape, from river to river, from bay to bay; accumulating by that hard labor of an overworked, starved ship the blackened mass of these documents.Massy kept them under lock and key like a treasure.There was in them, as in the experience of life, the fascination of hope, the excitement of a half-penetrated mystery, the longing of a half-satisfied desire."
"在一次航行中，他会连续几天都把自己关在住舱里，研究这些单子。使用过度的轮机那有节奏的振动声传到他的耳朵里来。他会动足脑筋，专心研究那一行行不连贯的数字，对那些毫无意义的数字次序，就像对无法捉摸的命运那样感到困惑。他抱着一个信念，在这些偶然的结果中，一定在什么地方隐藏着某种必然的联系。他认为他已经看到了这个形式。他头晕。他四肢疼痛。他机械地抽着烟斗。一种沉思的恍惚状态，犹如麻醉药对身体起消极的镇静作用那样，会平息他暴躁的脾气，同时他的智力仍然在紧张地活动着。九、九、零、四、二。他记下来。下一个彩票大奖的得奖号码是四七零零五。将来写信到马尼拉去买彩票的时候，是这个号码的当然不能要。他咕哝着，手里拿着铅笔……“最后一个数字是五。嗯……嗯。”他舔湿自己的手指，把那些单子翻得沙沙作响。哈！然而，那是什么呢。三年以前，在九月那次开奖中，是九、零、四、二那个号码得到了头奖。这最值得注意。这提供了一个线索，一条确定的规律！他害怕在这一大堆多得叫人受不了的资料中错过一个隐藏着的原理。是什么呢？他会低低地趴在书桌上，一动也不动地坐上半个小时，连肌肉也不动一下。在他背后，整个住舱里弥漫着一片浓烟，好像那里在没有人注意、没有人听到的情况下爆炸过一颗炸弹一样。 ","For days together, on a trip, he would shut himself up in his berth with them: the thump of the toiling engines pulsated in his ear; and he would weary his brain poring over the rows of disconnected figures, bewildering by their senseless sequence, resembling the hazards of destiny itself.He nourished a conviction that there must be some logic lurking somewhere in the results of chance.He thought he had seen its very form.His head swam; his limbs ached; he puffed at his pipe mechanically; a contemplative stupor would soothe the fretfulness of his temper, like the passive bodily quietude procured by a drug, while the intellect remains tensely on the stretch.Nine, nine, aught, four, two.He made a note.The next winning number of the great prize was forty-seven thousand and five.These numbers of course would have to be avoided in the future when writing to Manilla for the tickets.He mumbled, pencil in hand...“and five. Hm...hm.” He wetted his finger: the papers rustled.Ha!But what’s this?Three years ago, in the September drawing, it was number nine, aught, four, two that took the first prize.Most remarkable.There was a hint there of a definite rule!He was afraid of missing some recondite principle in the overwhelming wealth of his material.What could it be? and for half an hour he would remain dead still, bent low over the desk, without twitching a muscle.At his back the whole berth would be thick with a heavy body of smoke, as if a bomb had burst in there, unnoticed, unheard."
"他最后会带着毫不动摇的信心做出决定，锁上书桌，跳起来，走出去。他会在那一部分前甲板上迅速地来回走着。那一片地方始终不堆没用的杂物，也不让一批批当地乘客耽搁。他们让人讨厌透了，但是他们也是不可轻视的财源。他需要苏法拉号能够挣到的每一分钱。凭良心说，确实不够！尽管运气的好坏无法确定。然而他一点也不担心，因为他不知道凭什么竟然相信，一年年过去，每个号码一定会轮到中奖的机会的。他认为这只是个时间问题，也是一个只要在每次开奖前尽力而为、多买彩票的问题。他通常总是买得很多。那艘船挣来的钱，还有他自己当轮机长的工资，一股脑都花在了那上面。他吝啬地把工资发给别人，这种心情既受到理智的克制，同时又带着强烈的惋惜。他阴沉着脸，恶狠狠地看着那些拿着扫帚打扫甲板的印度水手，那些拿着油腻的擦布擦着铜栏杆的水手；他恨不得随时向那个可怜的木工摇晃拳头，用蹩脚的马来话高声地臭骂他一顿——那个木工是个胆怯、病态、抽鸦片抽得迷迷糊糊的人。不管穿什么衣服，他总是穿一条松弛的蓝衬裤。那个“鬼子”暴跳如雷的时候，他总是丢掉工具逃到下面去，辫子晃来晃去，浑身发抖。但是，只有在他抬起眼睛看向驾驶台的时候，他才几乎气得头昏眼花，按照法律规定那里总有一个海员中的骗子在指挥着他的船。他讨厌每一个船长。这算得上是深仇宿怨了，从他第一次航海在轮机室里干活的时候起，就结下了仇怨，当时他还是个自以为了不起的楞头青呢。他们对他的轻蔑。在一个个船长那里受到的折磨——归根结蒂，他们在轮船上只不过是无足轻重的人。谁知当他已经飞黄腾达，身为船主的时候，他们仍然是他的灾星。他不得不把宝贵的金钱付给那些骄气十足、毫无用处的游手好闲的人。好像一个完全合格的轮机员——而且还是船主——却不适合身负全权指挥一艘船的重任。好吧! 他确实使他们的日子不好过；不过，这也是可怜的自我安慰罢了。他最后连那艘船也恨了起来，因为它需要修理，因为需要给它付煤帐，因为他挣的运费少得可怜。他会一边走，一边攥紧拳头，突然心怀恶意地揍栏杆一拳，似乎它也能感觉到疼痛一样。可是他又不能没有它。他需要它。他不得不拼命地抓住这艘船不放，让他的头露出在水面上，一直到期望中的幸运的洪流涌来，把他卷起，安全地送到志得意满、高高在上的岸上。","At last he would lock up the desk with the decision of unshaken confidence, jump and go out.He would walk swiftly back and forth on that part of the foredeck which was kept clear of the lumber and of the bodies of the native passengers.They were a great nuisance, but they were also a source of profit that could not be disdained.He needed every penny of profit the Sofala could make.Little enough it was, in all conscience!The incertitude of chance gave him no concern, since he had somehow arrived at the conviction that, in the course of years, every number was bound to have his winning turn.It was simply a matter of time and of taking as many tickets as he could afford for every drawing.He generally took rather more; all the earnings of the ship went that way, and also the wages he allowed himself as chief engineer.It was the wages he paid to others that he begrudged with a reasoned and at the same time a passionate regret.He scowled at the lascars with their deck brooms, at the quartermasters rubbing the brass rails with greasy rags; he was eager to shake his fist and roar abuse in bad Malay at the poor carpenter—a timid, sickly, opium-fuddled Chinaman, in loose blue drawers for all costume, who invariably dropped his tools and fled below, with streaming tail and shaking all over, before the fury of that “devil.” But it was when he raised up his eyes to the bridge where one of these sailor frauds was always planted by law in charge of his ship that he felt almost dizzy with rage.He abominated them all; it was an old feud, from the time he first went to sea, an unlicked cub with a great opinion of himself, in the engine-room.The slights that had been put upon him.The persecutions he had suffered at the hands of skippers—of absolute nobodies in a steamship after all.And now that he had risen to be a shipowner they were still a plague to him: he had absolutely to pay away precious money to the conceited useless loafers:—As if a fully qualified engineer—who was the owner as well—were not fit to be trusted with the whole charge of a ship.Well! he made it pretty warm for them; but it was a poor consolation.He had come in time to hate the ship too for the repairs she required, for the coal-bills he had to pay, for the poor beggarly freights she earned.He would clench his hand as he walked and hit the rail a sudden blow, viciously, as though she could be made to feel pain.And yet he could not do without er; he needed her; he must hang on to her tooth and nail to keep his head above water till the expected flood of fortune came sweeping up and landed him safely on the high shore of his ambition."
"现在可以什么事情都不用做了，无论什么事情都不用做了，而且有许多的钱，可以继续这样过下去。他已经尝到了权力的滋味，他有限的经历所知道的最高的权力形式——船主的权力。这真是个大骗局！虚空的虚空！他对自己的愚蠢感到吃惊。他追求幻影，抛弃实体。他对财富所能带来的满足知道得不够多，所以无法幻想任何豪华的场面来刺激他的想象力。他——一个整天喝得醉醺醺的锅炉修理工的孩子，怎么可能从工场中一直走进一艘英国北部地区的运煤船的轮机室去啊！但是他能很好地想象财富可以使人什么都用不着干的情景。他沉醉在这样的想象中，以忘掉现在的烦恼。他想象自己在赫尔的街上（他还是小孩子的时候，对那里的阴沟就已经熟悉了）转悠，口袋里装满了金币。他会给自己买一所房子。他结了婚的姐妹们、她们的丈夫、他从前的工场里的伙伴都会对他无限尊敬。什么都不用想。他的话就相当于法律。他在彩票中奖以前，很久没有工作干了；他记起了那天黄昏中奖的消息传来的时候，卡洛·马里安尼（别人通常叫他大肚子查理），德纳姆街尽头的贫民区里那个开旅馆的马耳他人，是如何欢天喜地地在他面前巴结奉承。尽管可怜的查理靠给种种卑鄙的行为帮忙来谋生，但他却会让许多穷得走投无路的白人赊欠伙食费。那个人一想到他的欠帐可以归还，就天真地乐不可支，还充满信心地指望在他楼下洞穴似的小酒店里庆祝几天。马西记得那里那些“窝囊废”白人的好奇和尊敬的神情。他觉得自己了不起。马西一发现自己有可能出人头地，就马上鼻子翘得老高，离开了查理那个声名狼藉的小旅馆。后来再回想起这些奉承的情景，真让人好不伤心。","It was now to do nothing, nothing whatever, and have plenty of money to do it on.He had tasted of power, the highest form of it his limited experience was aware of—the power of shipowning.What a deception!Vanity of vanities!He wondered at his folly.He had thrown away the substance for the shadow.Of the gratification of wealth he did not know enough to excite his imagination with any visions of luxury.How could he—the child of a drunken boiler-maker—going straight from the workshop into the engine-room of a north-country collier!But the notion of the absolute idleness of wealth he could very well conceive.He reveled in it, to forget his present troubles; he imagined himself walking about the streets of Hull (he knew their gutters well as a boy) with his pockets full of sovereigns.He would buy himself a house; his married sisters, their husbands, his old workshop chums, would render him infinite homage.There would be nothing to think of.His word would be law.He had been out of work for a long time before he won his prize, and he remembered how Carlo Mariani (commonly known as Paunchy Charley), the Maltese hotel-keeper at the slummy end of Denham Street, had cringed joyfully before him in the evening, when the news had come.Poor Charley, though he made his living by ministering to various abject vices, gave credit for their food to many a piece of white wreckage.He was naively overjoyed at the idea of his old bills being paid, and he reckoned confidently on a spell of festivities in the cavernous grog-shop downstairs.Massy remembered the curious, respectful looks of the “trashy” white men in the place.His heart had swelled within him.Massy had left Charley’s infamous den directly he had realized the possibilities open to him, and with his nose in the air.Afterwards the memory of these adulations was a great sadness."
"这就是金钱真正的力量——不带一点麻烦，也不需要动脑筋。他想的时候很费劲，感觉却很逼真。在他迟钝的脑筋想来，任何有条理的生活计划带来的种种难以应付的棘手问题，显然都是人们恶意地给他设置的障碍。他当上了船主，人人都串通一气，联手使他成为一个无足轻重的人。他怎么会这么蠢，买下这艘该死的船。他上了个大当，真是糟透了；上了这个当，简直没有出头的时候。他那缺乏远见的野心给他带来了越来越多的困难，使他最后变得憎恨每一个他接触的人。他生性暴躁，对自己的地位又异乎寻常的敏感，结果他自作自受，过着地狱般的生活——在这样的生活中，他那迷失了方向的灵魂一直陷在绞尽脑汁的苦思冥想中，痛苦万分，无法自拔。","This was the true power of money,—and no trouble with it, nor any thinking required either.He thought with difficulty and felt vividly; to his blunt brain the problems offered by any ordered scheme of life seemed in their cruel toughness to have been put in his way by the obvious malevolence of men.As a shipowner everyone had conspired to make him a nobody.How could he have been such a fool as to purchase that accursed ship.He had been abominably swindled; there was no end to this swindling; and as the difficulties of his improvident ambition gathered thicker round him, he really came to hate everybody he had ever come in contact with.A temper naturally irritable and an amazing sensitiveness to the claims of his own personality had ended by making of life for him a sort of inferno—a place where his lost soul had been given up to the torment of savage brooding."
"然而他从来没有恨任何人像恨那个老人那么厉害，那个老人在一个夜晚突然出现，把他从一场严重的灾祸中——从那伙恶劣的水手的阴谋中，搭救出来。他好像从天而降，来到了船上。他的脚步声回响在空荡荡的轮船上；甲板上重复传来那陌生的、低沉的问话声：“马西先生，马西先生在吗?”这简直像一个奇迹一样让人吃惊。当时马西正在轮机室里拿着一支蜡烛心情沉闷地转悠。四处都是骨架似的机器投下的巨大阴影。他从那冷冰冰的轮机室深处走上来，看到一个仪表堂堂的老人，胡子像一片银胸铠，屹立在即将消逝的残阳映红的暮色中，惊讶得说不出一句话来。","But he had never hated anyone so much as that old man who had turned up one evening to save him from an utter disaster,—from the conspiracy of the wretched sailors.He seemed to have fallen on board from the sky.His footsteps echoed on the empty steamer, and the strange deep-toned voice on deck repeating interrogatively the words, “Mr. Massy, Mr. Massy there?” had been startling like a wonder.And coming up from the depths of the cold engine-room, where he had been pottering dismally with a candle amongst the enormous shadows, thrown on all sides by the skeleton limbs of machinery, Massy had been struck dumb by astonishment in the presence of that imposing old man with a beard like a silver plate, towering in the dusk rendered lurid by the expiring flames of sunset."
"“找我有买卖吗？什么买卖？我不做买卖。你没看到吗，这艘船暂停航行了？”马西认为有人不放过他，来讥讽他倒霉的处境，被逼得豁出去了。然后他简直无法相信自己的耳朵。那个老家伙是什么意思？不可能发生这样的事情。这只是一场梦。不久他就会醒过来，发现那个人像朦胧的幽灵一样消失了。这个强壮而陌生的老人神情严肃，气度非凡，说话的声调坚决而有礼貌，给马西留下了深刻的印象。他几乎有点害怕了。不过，这并不是梦。五百镑不是梦。他顿时怀疑起来。这是什么意思？不用说，送上门来的钱财决不能放过。然而这件事情背后，会有什么企图呢？","“Want to see me on business?What business?I am doing no business.Can’t you see that this ship is laid up?” Massy had turned at bay before the pursuing irony of his disaster.Afterwards he could not believe his ears.What was that old fellow getting at?Things don’t happen that way.It was a dream.He would presently wake up and find the man vanished like a shape of mist.The gravity, the dignity, the firm and courteous tone of that athletic old stranger impressed Massy.He was almost afraid.But it was no dream.Five hundred pounds are no dream.At once he became suspicious.What did it mean?Of course it was an offer to catch hold of for dear life.But what could there be behind?"
"他们约好明天一大早在律师的办公室里见面。两人分手以前，马西问自己，他的动机是什么呢？他那一宿都没有合眼，一直在推敲那个协定的条文的字句——不知为何，这个文件成为了这一类文件中独一无二的一个，它的内容到处流传，变成港口上的谈资和使人惊奇的东西。","Before they had parted, after appointing a meeting in a solicitor’s office early on the morrow, Massy was asking himself, What is his motive?He spent the night in hammering out the clauses of the agreement—a unique instrument of its sort whose tenor got bruited abroad somehow and became the talk and wonder of the port."
"马西的目的无非是尽可能地为他自己多留后路，以便将来在甩掉他的合伙人时不必立即归还股金。惠利船长费尽心机是为了确保他的钱安全可靠。那不是艾薇的钱吗？——她的一部分财产，她的另一份财产是她老父亲那还没有被岁月压垮的身体。他深信他对她的爱所产生的力量，完全有把握克制住自己，他庄重而平静地接受马西那些防止他不称职、不老实和酗酒而提出的愚蠢而狡猾的条文，来换取另一些严格的条款。三年期满后，他有权取消合伙关系，抽回那笔钱。条款规定要准备专款偿还他。然而他如果不满期限就离开苏法拉号的话，无论什么原因（除了死亡以外），那马西就可以推迟整整一年归还他。“生病呢？”那个律师提醒过。他是个刚从欧洲过来的年轻人，还没有被业务压得筋疲力尽，他觉得很有趣。马西开始油腔滑调地抱怨起来：“他怎么可能会生病呢？”","Massy’s object had been to secure for himself as many ways as possible of getting rid of his partner without being called upon at once to pay back his share.Captain Whalley’s efforts were directed to making the money secure.Was it not Ivy’s money—a part of her fortune whose only other asset was the time-defying body of her old father?Sure of his forbearance in the strength of his love for her, he accepted, with stately serenity, Massy’s stupidly cunning paragraphs against his incompetence, his dishonesty, his drunkenness, for the sake of other stringent stipulations.At the end of three years he was at liberty to withdraw from the partnership, taking his money with him.Provision was made for forming a fund to pay him off.But if he left the Sofala before the term, from whatever cause (barring death), Massy was to have a whole year for paying.“Illness?” the lawyer had suggested: a young man fresh from Europe and not overburdened with business, who was rather amused.Massy began to whine unctuously, “How could he be expected?...” "
"“不必谈了。”当时惠利船长带着对自己身体完全充满信心的态度说。“听天由命吧。”他加上一句。哪怕是健康地活着，我们也随时有可能送命，但是他带着更强大的无畏精神相信造物主——他的造物主知道他的思想、他的富于人情味的爱以及他的动机。他的造物主知道他在怎样利用他的健康——他需要健康到什么程度……“我相信我的第一次生病就是我的最后—次。在我的记忆中，我从未生过病，”他说，“不必谈了。”","“Let that go,” Captain Whalley had said with a superb confidence in his body.“Acts of God,” he added.In the midst of life we are in death, but he trusted his Maker with a still greater fearlessness—his Maker who knew his thoughts, his human affections, and his motives.His Creator knew what use he was making of his health—how much he wanted it...“I trust my first illness will be my last.I’ve never been ill that I can remember,” he had remarked.“Let it go.” "
"然而这件事一开始，他就惹得马西对他产生了敌意，因为他只肯出五百镑，而不是六百镑。“我做不到，”他仅仅说了这一句话，就显出了他决心已定、无法改变的神情，马西马上不再缠着不放，不过他自己想：“做不到！老吝啬鬼。不愿意罢了！他一定有很多钱，可是他巴不得一个子也不用花，就捞一张柔软的铺位，做得到的话，还要分掉我六分之一的利润。”","But at this early stage he had already awakened Massy’s hostility by refusing to make it six hundred instead of five.“I cannot do that,” was all he had said, simply, but with so much decision that Massy desisted at once from pressing the point, but had thought to himself, “Can’t! Old curmudgeon.@Won’t@ He must have lots of money, but he would like to get hold of a soft berth and the sixth part of my profits for nothing if he only could.” "
"这几年来，马西一直在一种近乎害怕的感情抑制下，对他越来越讨厌了。这个人直率的态度似乎很危险。不过近来他变了，显得不再那么可怕，精力也差了，好像受了内伤似的。可是他仍然保持着直率、无畏和沉默寡言的态度，让人无法理解。当马西知道到期以后这个人就打算撇下他，撇下自己去对付锅炉问题的时候，他对他的讨厌更加强烈，渐渐地变成了憎恨。 ","And during these years Massy’s dislike grew under the restraint of something resembling fear.The simplicity of that man appeared dangerous.Of late he had changed, however, had appeared less formidable and with a lessened vigor of life, as though he had received a secret wound.But still he remained incomprehensible in his simplicity, fearlessness, and rectitude.And when Massy learned that he meant to leave him at the end of the time, to leave him confronted with the problem of boilers, his dislike blazed up secretly into hate."
"这使他的眼光变得异常锐利，有很长一段时期，斯特恩先生告诉他的事情，他没有一件不知道的。他费尽力气，吓唬那个鬼鬼祟祟的下流东西，想办法使他不要多嘴。他要独自应付这个局面。在斯特恩先生看来可能显得不可思议的是，自己竟然还没有放弃说服那个可恶的人留下的心愿和希望。嗨！没有别的办法，除非他想放弃发财的机会。可是现在，自从在巴都贝鲁穿过沙洲以来，事情好像急转直下，到了紧要关头。这使他心烦意乱，连研究中奖号码也无法平息他的激动。这时候，舱房里的暮色越来越深，越来越暗了。","It had made him so clear-eyed that for a long time now Mr. Sterne could have told him nothing he did not know.He had much ado in trying to terrorize that mean sneak into silence; he wanted to deal alone with the situation; and—incredible as it might have appeared to Mr. Sterne—he had not yet given up the desire and the hope of inducing that hated old man to stay.Why! there was nothing else to do, unless he were to abandon his chances of fortune.But now, suddenly, since the crossing of the bar at Batu Beru things seemed to be coming rapidly to a point.It disquieted him so much that the study of the winning numbers failed to soothe his agitation: and the twilight in the cabin deepened, very somber."
"他放好那些单子，又一次咕哝：“啊，别，老弟，你别这样。哪怕我知道也不行。”他不打算让那个眨巴着眼睛、爱偷听的骗子逼他硬来。他再次双手捧着脑袋。他把自己关在这个黑暗的小天地里，一动不动，好像把自己同甲板上熙熙攘攘、人声鼎沸的场面完全隔绝了。","He put the list away, muttering once more, “Oh, no, my boy, you don’t.Not if I know it.”He did not mean the blinking, eavesdropping humbug to force his action.He took his head again into his hands; his immobility confined in the darkness of this shut-up little place seemed to make him a thing apart infinitely removed from the stir and the sounds of the deck."
"他听到了他们的谈话。旅客们兴奋地叽叽喳喳聊天。有人把一个沉重的箱子拖过门口。他听到上边惠利船长的声音：","He heard them: the passengers were beginning to jabber excitedly; somebody dragged a heavy box past his door.He heard Captain Whalley’s voice above— "
"“停泊，斯特恩先生。”回答从前面甲板上的某个地方传来：","“Stations, Mr. Sterne.” And the answer from somewhere on deck forward— "
"“是，是，先生。”","“Ay, ay, sir.” "
"“咱们这一回停泊，船头向上游。已经退潮了。”","“We shall moor head up stream this time; the ebb has made.” "
" “船头向上游，先生。” ","“Head up stream, sir.” "
"“你来负责，斯特恩先生。”","“You will see to it, Mr. Sterne.” "
"回答被轮机室的皿形钟响亮的声音淹没了。螺旋桨继续慢腾腾地拍打着：一、二、三，一、二、三。中间有些停顿，好像转动的时候有些踌躇似的。皿形钟一次次地发出响亮的声音。湖水被桨片搅得片刻向这边翻腾，片刻又向那边翻腾，在近旁激起很大的吵闹声。马西先生并没有动。河对面四分之一英里外，另一面的岸上有一点亮光，最多跟一颗星星一样大，慢慢地绕过左舷，漂了过去。范怀克先生的码头上，有人在回答船上招呼的叫声。缆绳扔过去，没扔中，又扔过去。从岸上下游来了一条大舢板，把那个酋长威风地接走。舢板上有人掌着一个火把，摇曳的火光突然照红了他的舱房，照在了他的身上。马西先生没有动。这艘船最后笨重地转了几下以后，机器停止了。皿形钟那拉长了的当啷啷的声音表明，船长已经结束工作了。许多各式各样的船和独木舟向苏法拉号右边靠了过来。接着传来的是溅水声、喊叫声、拖着脚的走动声、包裹的着地声、本地旅客离去的种种吵闹声。过了片刻，这些声音慢慢地平静了下来。在岸上，一个有教养的、微微带点发号施令的声音从近处传了过来：","The answer was covered by the autocratic clang on the engine-room gong.The propeller went on beating slowly: one, two, three; one, two, three—with pauses as if hesitating on the turn.The gong clanged time after time, and the water churned this way and that by the blades was making a great noisy commotion alongside.Mr. Massy did not move.A shore-light on the other bank, a quarter of a mile across the river, drifted, no bigger than a tiny star, passing slowly athwart the circle of the port.Voices from Mr. Van Wyk’s jetty answered the hails from the ship; ropes were thrown and missed and thrown again; the swaying flame of a torch carried in a large sampan coming to fetch away in state the Rajah from down the coast cast a sudden ruddy glare into his cabin, over his very person.Mr. Massy did not move.After a few last ponderous turns the engines stopped, and the prolonged clanging of the gong signified that the captain had done with them.A great number of boats and canoes of all sizes boarded the off-side of the Sofala.Then after a time the tumult of splashing, of cries, of shuffling feet, of packages dropped with a thump, the noise of the native passengers going away, subsided slowly.On the shore, a voice, cultivated, slightly authoritative, spoke very close alongside— "
"“这一回给我带信来了吗?”","“Brought any mail for me this time?” "
"“带来了，范怀克先生。”这是斯特恩的声音。他靠在栏杆上用恭敬而热切的声音回答：“要我给您送过来吗?”","“Yes, Mr. Van Wyk.” This was from Sterne, answering over the rail in a tone of respectful cordiality.“Shall I bring it up to you?” "
"但是那个声音又问了： ","But the voice asked again— "
"“船长在哪里?”","“Where’s the captain?” "
"“我想还在驾驶台上。他还没有从椅子上站起来呢。要我……”","“Still on the bridge, I believe.He hasn’t left his chair.Shall I...” "
"那个声音大大咧咧地打断了他的话。 ","The voice interrupted negligently."
"“我上船来。”","“I will come on board.” "
"“范怀克先生，”斯特恩突然焦急地大声叫起来，“您能否帮我一个忙……”","“Mr. Van Wyk,” Sterne suddenly broke out with an eager effort, “will you do me the favor...” "
"那个大副很快地走向了舷梯。寂静无声了。马西先生在黑暗中没有动。","The mate walked away quickly towards the gangway.A silence fell.Mr. Massy in the dark did not move."
"甚至听到有人慢腾腾地拖着脚，懒洋洋地走过他的舱房，他也没有动。他宁愿隔着关上的门大喊一声：","He did not move even when he heard slow shuffling footsteps pass his cabin lazily.He contented himself to bellow out through the closed door— "
"“你——杰克！”","“You—Jack!” "
"脚步声匆匆地转回来。门把喀嚓一声，那个二管轮出现在了门口；在他背后的天光映照下，他显得黑乎乎的，脸和他身子的其他部分一样黑。","The footsteps came back without haste; the door handle rattled, and the second engineer appeared in the opening, shadowy in the sheen of the skylight at his back, with his face apparently as black as the rest of his figure."
"“咱们这一回走了很长时间啊。”马西先生没有改变姿势，咆哮道。","“We have been very long coming up this time,” Mr. Massy growled, without changing his attitude."
"“锅炉的一半管子因为漏气堵住了，你还能指望走多快呢。” 二管轮开始头头是道地为自己辩护。 ","“What do you expect with half the boiler tubes plugged up for leaks.” The second defended himself loquaciously."
"“别耍嘴皮子。”马西说。","“None of your lip,” said Massy."
"“你那蹩脚锅炉不争气——我说。”他忠心的助手没精打采、声音嘶哑地反驳道，“到下面去，你自己去烧一个压力的蒸汽——只要你敢的话。我可不敢。”","“None of your rotten boilers—I say,” retorted his faithful subordinate without animation, huskily.“Go down there and carry a head of steam on them yourself—if you dare.I don’t.” "
"“那么，你不配干这个活。”马西说。另一个人轻轻地发出响声，好像是笑声，但也可能是骂声。","“You aren’t worth your salt then,” Massy said.The other made a faint noise which resembled a laugh but might have been a snarl."
"“船走得慢比干脆走不成好。”他劝告这位一直受到他钦佩的上级。马西先生终于动了。他从椅子上转过身来，咬牙切齿地说：","“Better go slow than stop the ship altogether,” he admonished his admired superior.Mr. Massy moved at last.He turned in his chair, and grinding his teeth— "
"“你该死，船也该死！我巴不得它沉在海底。那你就得饿肚子了。”","“Dam’ you and the ship!I wish she were at the bottom of the sea.Then you would have to starve.” "
"那个可靠的二管轮轻轻地关上了门。","The trusty second engineer closed the door gently."
"马西听着动静。他本应该洗个澡的，但是那个二管轮没有走到洗澡间去，而是走进了他隔壁的舱房。马西先生跳起身来等着。突然他听到里面啪的一声锁上了。他冲出去，狠狠地踢那扇门。","Massy listened.Instead of passing on to the bathroom where he should have gone to clean himself, the second entered his cabin, which was next door.Mr. Massy jumped up and waited.Suddenly he heard the lock snap in there.He rushed out and gave a violent kick to the door."
"“我想你把自己锁在里面，是要喝一个烂醉。”他喊道。 ","“I believe you are locking yourself up to get drunk,” he shouted."
"过了片刻，传来一个模模糊糊的声音： ","A muffled answer came after a while."
"“我自己的时间。”","“My own time.” "
"“你要是在航行中老是喝得醉醺醺的话，我会解雇你的。”马西嚷道。","“If you take to boozing on the trip I’ll fire you out,” Massy cried."
"紧接着这个威胁的是一阵倔强的沉默。马西手足无措地走开了。岸上，两个人影出现了，他们朝舷梯走去。他听到一个语调轻蔑的声音：","An obstinate silence followed that threat.Massy moved away perplexed.On the bank two figures appeared, approaching the gangway.He heard a voice tinged with contempt— "
"“我很怀疑你的话。但我肯定会告诉他的。”","“I would rather doubt your word.But I shall certainly speak to him of this.” "
"另一个人的声音是斯特恩的，他用表示遗憾而一本正经的措辞说：","The other voice, Sterne’s, said with a sort of regretful formality— "
"“谢谢。这就是我想要的。我必须尽我的本份。”","“Thanks.That’s all I want.I must do my duty.” "
"马西先生感到很惊奇。一条短小、利索的人影轻松地跳上了甲板，差点撞到他怀里。他正站在舷梯灯的那圈灯光后面。两人互相匆匆说了一声“晚上好”，然后向驾驶台走去，马西对慢腾腾地跟在他后面的斯特恩粗暴地说：","Mr. Massy was surprised.A short, dapper figure leaped lightly on the deck and nearly bounded into him where he stood beyond the circle of light from the gangway lamp.When it had passed towards the bridge, after exchanging a hurried “Good evening,” Massy said surlily to Sterne who followed with slow steps— "
"“喂，你巴结范怀克先生有什么企图?” ","“What is it you’re making up to Mr. Van Wyk for, now?” "
"“没那种事，马西先生。范怀克先生才不会把我放在眼里呢。恐怕在他看来，你也不行，先生。惠利船长，那才差不多。他请他今天晚上去家里吃饭。”               ","“Far from it, Mr. Massy.I am not good enough for Mr. Van Wyk.Neither are you, sir, in his opinion, I am afraid.Captain Whalley is, it seems.He’s gone to ask him to dine up at the house this evening.” "
"接着他悄悄地对自己低声说:","Then he murmured to himself darkly— "
"“希望他会喜欢这顿晚饭。”","“I hope he will like it.” "
"第十二章","XII "
"范怀克先生，一个巴都贝鲁的白人，以前是海军军官。只有他自己最清楚，他究竟为了什么理由才放弃了那灿烂的前程，在遥远的海岸上开拓荒地，种植烟叶。他喜欢上了惠利船长。新船长的外貌吸引了他的注意力。他看到过苏法拉号的驾驶台上一个又一个各种类型的船长，惠利船长和他们毫无相似之处，不同的程度简直让人无法想象。","Mr. Van Wyk, the white man of Batu Beru, an ex-naval officer who, for reasons best known to himself, had thrown away the promise of a brilliant career to become the pioneer of tobacco-planting on that remote part of the coast, had learned to like Captain Whalley.The appearance of the new skipper had attracted his attention.Nothing more unlike all the diverse types he had seen succeeding each other on the bridge of the Sofala could be imagined."
"当时的巴都贝鲁完全不能和后来相比。后来那里成了一个繁荣的烟草种植区中心，一个有着热带郊区风光、满是别墅的小小的住宅区，这个住宅区坐落在一条长长的街道上，街道两边绿树成荫，点缀着一个个繁花似锦、修剪得整整齐齐的花园，以及一条在下午经常使用的三英里长的马车道，那里住着一位优秀的外交官，以及他丰满、活泼的妻子。他领导着一个由结了婚的种植园经理，以及在大企业里就职的单身的年轻人们组成的社交圈。","At that time Batu Beru was not what it has become since: the center of a prosperous tobacco-growing district, a tropically suburban-looking little settlement of bungalows in one long street shaded with two rows of trees, embowered by the flowering and trim luxuriance of the gardens, with a three-mile-long carriage-road for the afternoon drives and a first-class Resident with a fat, cheery wife to lead the society of married estate-managers and unmarried young fellows in the service of the big companies."
"这一派繁荣的景象当时还没有呢。只有范怀克先生独自住在森林左岸中开辟出来的一片纵深的空地上，日子过得很兴旺，那片空地从上到下，一直伸展到了水边。他那座孤零零的小屋同苏丹的那些房子隔河相望。苏丹是个心神不安、意气消沉的年老的统治者，他已经无法同爱情和战争打交道，对他来说，生命已经不再有什么乐趣（只剩下了不祥的预感），而时间不再有任何价值。他害怕死亡，可是他希望能在白人把他的国家从他那里接收过去以前死去。他常常要渡河（每次带去的人都不会少于挤得满满的十艘船），满心希望在这个问题上，能从他自己的白人那里打听到一些相关信息。阳台上有一张他一直坐的椅子。朝廷上的那些高官都是盘坐在家具中间的地毯和兽皮上的。次要人物则留在下面房子和河中间的那片草地上，沿着正门横排成三四排。通常在天蒙蒙亮的时候，苏丹就上门拜访了。范怀克先生忍受着这样的入侵。他会从卧房的窗口点点头，手里拿着牙刷和剃刀，不然就是穿着晨衣从那一大堆朝臣中间穿过去。他片刻出现，片刻不见，哼着曲调专心地修手指甲，在他那刮过胡子的脸上擦科隆香水，喝早茶，出去看他的工人干活，又回来翻翻桌子上的报纸，看上一两页书，要不，就坐在他那架小型立式钢琴前的琴凳上，两条胳膊伸得笔直，手指放在琴键上，身子向后，微微地左右摇晃。当他被逼得必须开口说话的时候，他会出于纯粹的同情，回答一些模棱两可、含含糊糊的安慰话。也许是出于同样的感情，他才会那么慷慨好客，大量供应威士忌苏打，不止一次弄得他自己一个礼拜都喝不上苏打水。那个老人答应过他，只要他喜欢，开垦多少地都行。这简直就是一笔财富。","All this prosperity was not yet; and Mr. Van Wyk prospered alone on the left bank on his deep clearing carved out of the forest, which came down above and below to the water’s edge.His lonely bungalow faced across the river the houses of the Sultan: a restless and melancholy old ruler who had done with love and war, for whom life no longer held any savor (except of evil forebodings) and time never had any value.He was afraid of death, and hoped he would die before the white men were ready to take his country from him.He crossed the river frequently (with never less than ten boats crammed full of people), in the wistful hope of extracting some information on the subject from his own white man.There was a certain chair on the veranda he always took: the dignitaries of the court squatted on the rugs and skins between the furniture: the inferior people remained below on the grass plot between the house and the river in rows three or four deep all along the front.Not seldom the visit began at daybreak.Mr. Van Wyk tolerated these inroads.He would nod out of his bedroom window, tooth-brush or razor in hand, or pass through the throng of courtiers in his bathing robe.He appeared and disappeared humming a tune, polished his nails with attention, rubbed his shaved face with @eau-de-Cologne@, drank his early tea, went out to see his coolies at work: returned, looked through some papers on his desk, read a page or two in a book or sat before his cottage piano leaning back on the stool, his arms extended, fingers on the keys, his body swaying slightly from side to side.When absolutely forced to speak he gave evasive vaguely soothing answers out of pure compassion: the same feeling perhaps made him so lavishly hospitable with the aerated drinks that more than once he left himself without soda-water for a whole week.That old man had granted him as much land as he cared to have cleared: it was neither more nor less than a fortune."
"无论范怀克先生追求的是财富，还是远远地避开他的同类过隐居生活，总之他不可能挑中比这更好的地方了。甚至是那家受资助的公司的邮船，它们虽然驶到沿海岸一个个满是棕榈叶搭建的简陋的房子的居住区去，却在远处海面上驶过巴都贝鲁河的河口。合同是很早以前就签订的。或许几年以后，合同期满，巴都贝鲁会包括在服务范围内。这期间，范怀克先生的所有信件都寄往马六甲，他在那里的代理人一个月一次托苏法拉号带给他。结果是只要马西手头没钱（因为买了太多彩票），或者难以找到船长，范怀克先生就收不到那些信件和报纸。就这件事来而言，苏法拉号的命运牵涉到了他的切身利益。虽然他认为自己是个隐士（而且不是一时的心血来潮，因为他已经坚持八年了），但是他还是喜欢了解这个世界上发生的一切事情。","Whether it was fortune or seclusion from his kind that Mr. Van Wyk sought, he could not have pitched upon a better place.Even the mail-boats of the subsidized company calling on the veriest clusters of palm-thatched hovels along the coast steamed past the mouth of Batu Beru river far away in the offing.The contract was old: perhaps in a few years’ time, when it had expired, Batu Beru would be included in the service; meantime all Mr. Van Wyk’s mail was addressed to Malacca, whence his agent sent it across once a month by the Sofala.It followed that whenever Massy had run short of money (through taking too many lottery tickets), or got into a difficulty about a skipper, Mr. Van Wyk was deprived of his letter and newspapers.In so far he had a personal interest in the fortunes of the Sofala.Though he considered himself a hermit (and for no passing whim evidently, since he had stood eight years of it already), he liked to know what went on in the world."
"阳台附近摆着一个胡桃木书柜（那是去年苏法拉号运来的——每样东西都是苏法拉号运来的），柜上堆着大量的《泰晤士报周刊》，大张的《鹿特丹报》，包在绿包书纸里的风靡全球的《写真》，一本没有封面而有插图的荷兰出版物，几本橘黄色封面的德国杂志。那些报刊上都压着青铜镇纸。还有一包包的新乐谱——尽管钢琴（这是几年前苏法拉号运来的）在潮湿的森林空气中总是音调不准。有时候接连六十天，他对外界的事物一无所知，而且还无从知道究竟是怎么回事，这真让人恼火。所以当苏法拉号再次出现的时候，范怀克先生会皱着雪白的眉毛从阳台的台阶上走下来，越过门前的草地，一直向下走到水边。","Handy on the veranda upon a walnut @etagere@ (it had come last year by the Sofala)—everything came by the Sofala there lay, piled up under bronze weights, a pile of the Times’ weekly edition, the large sheets of the Rotterdam Courant, the Graphic in its world-wide green wrappers, an illustrated Dutch publication without a cover, the numbers of a German magazine with covers of the “@Bismarck malade@” color.There were also parcels of new music—though the piano (it had come years ago by the Sofala in the damp atmosphere of the forests was generally out of tune.) It was vexing to be cut off from everything for sixty days at a stretch sometimes, without any means of knowing what was the matter.And when the Sofala reappeared Mr. Van Wyk would descend the steps of the veranda and stroll over the grass plot in front of his house, down to the waterside, with a frown on his white brow."
"“我猜，你们的船出了事，耽搁了。”","“You’ve been laid up after an accident, I presume.” "
"他是向着驾驶台说的，可是在有人来得及回答以前，马西肯定已经爬过栏杆，来到岸上，挤上前，两只手掌紧紧地握在一起，光滑的脑袋搭拉着，好像头顶上粘着一绺绺黑线和黑带似的。他对不得不作这样一番解释感到非常愤怒，他哼哼唧唧的说话会明显变得可怜巴巴，这时候他会一直设法从他的大嘴唇上挤出一丝微笑。","He addressed the bridge, but before anybody could answer Massy was sure to have already scrambled ashore over the rail and pushed in, squeezing the palms of his hands together, bowing his sleek head as if gummed all over the top with black threads and tapes.And he would be so enraged at the necessity of having to offer such an explanation that his moaning would be positively pitiful, while all the time he tried to compose his big lips into a smile."
"“不，范怀克先生。你肯定不会相信的。我没法从那些混蛋当中找到一个人把船开出来。那些懒惰的畜生都不听我的，可是法律，你也知道，范怀克先生……”","“No, Mr. Van Wyk.You would not believe it.I couldn’t get one of those wretches to take the ship out.Not a single one of the lazy beasts could be induced, and the law, you know, Mr. Van Wyk...” "
"他不停地抱怨着，连连赔着不是。什么阴谋啊、暗算啊、嫉妒啊，他强调地说出这些词，使劲发着牢骚。范怀克先生微微扮着鬼脸，注视着自己修得很亮的手指甲，会说上一句：“嗯，很不幸。”接着转过身去，背对着他。","He moaned at great length apologetically; the words conspiracy, plot, envy, came out prominently, whined with greater energy.Mr. Van Wyk, examining with a faint grimace his polished finger-nails, would say, “H’m. Very unfortunate,” and turn his back on him."
"范怀克先生挑剔，聪明，还有点玩世不恭，对上流社会非常熟悉（他离开他的工作岗位和欧洲以前，在海军部里一个在陆地上受人羡慕的职位上干过一年），因为他早年的训练，又因为他显出一种他的对头可以称之为纨袴习气的作风——他带点骄傲、武断和冷漠的态度，似乎是对他过去养尊处优的生活的歪曲反映；在这种态度的掩盖下，他内心却感情热烈，而且富有同情心。他把一些人从密密匝匝的丛林阴影中拉到了阳光下，让他们在他的庄园里当工人，设法用近于军队的纪律来管理他们。每天黄昏，他都穿上雪白的衬衫，戴上硬邦邦、亮晃晃的衬胸和高领子，好像他打算保持穿晚礼服这个合乎礼仪的规矩，但是他的腰上却束着一条深红的粗腰带，似乎是对荒野的一种让步——从前是他的对头，现在已经成为被征服的伴侣。","Fastidious, clever, slightly skeptical, accustomed to the best society (he had held a much-envied shore appointment at the Ministry of Marine for a year preceding his retreat from his profession and from Europe), he possessed a latent warmth of feeling and a capacity for sympathy which were concealed by a sort of haughty, arbitrary indifference of manner arising from his early training; and by a something an enemy might have called foppish, in his aspect—like a distorted echo of past elegance.He managed to keep an almost military discipline amongst the coolies of the estate he had dragged into the light of day out of the tangle and shadows of the jungle; and the white shirt he put on every evening with its stiff glossy front and high collar looked as if he had meant to preserve the decent ceremony of evening-dress, but had wound a thick crimson sash above his hips as a concession to the wilderness, once his adversary, now his vanquished companion."
"此外，这还是一种促进健康的措施。他穿一件薄丝料子的短上衣，胸前完全敞开，在背后飘荡着。他的金发蓬松，头顶已经稀疏了，两鬓微微有些鬈；一抹精心修饰过的小胡子，一个没有修饰过的额头；他的裤子同他那件薄丝上衣是相同的料子，剪裁得笔挺，大裤腿下露出一双闪闪发亮的浅口漆皮靴；这副模样，再加上那条腰带，让人想起一个充满浪漫色彩的海盗头子，又让人想起一个过着养尊处优的隐居生活、喜好非正统服装的、微微秃顶的花花公子。","Moreover, it was a hygienic precaution.Worn wide open in front, a short jacket of some airy silken stuff floated from his shoulders.His fluffy, fair hair, thin at the top, curled slightly at the sides; a carefully arranged mustache, an ungarnished forehead, the gleam of low patent shoes peeping under the wide bottom of trowsers cut straight from the same stuff as the gossamer coat, completed a figure recalling, with its sash, a pirate chief of romance, and at the same time the elegance of a slightly bald dandy indulging, in seclusion, a taste for unorthodox costume."
"这是他黄昏时候的穿着打扮。苏法拉号抵达巴都贝鲁的固定时间是日落以前一个小时。他在水边来来回回地走着，背后是覆盖着绿草的斜坡，斜坡顶上是一座又低又长的平房，棕榈叶盖的屋顶很陡，房子周围满是开花的藤蔓，一直爬到了屋檐上。出现在这个背景前面，他显得很别致，而且不知为何，看上去也很恰当。当苏法拉号在拴缆绳的时候，他在靠岸的地方剩下的几棵树的树荫下踱来踱去，一直到他能够上船。船上的白人跟他不是同一类人。那个老苏丹（尽管他一直爱擅自闯进屋来，真叫人头痛）倒确实更投合他爱挑剔的性格。然而，他们终究是白人。这艘船每隔一段时间来一次，打破他日复一日相同的生活，却并不打扰他的清净。而且，从业务观点来看，这样的船也是需要的。  他生性喜欢准时，那艘船不能按规定时间来到的时候，他就会恼火。","It was his evening get-up.The proper time for the Sofala to arrive at Batu Beru was an hour before sunset, and he looked picturesque, and somehow quite correct too, walking at the water’s edge on the background of grass slope crowned with a low long bungalow with an immensely steep roof of palm thatch, and clad to the eaves in flowering creepers.While the Sofala was being made fast he strolled in the shade of the few trees left near the landing-place, waiting till he could go on board.Her white men were not of his kind.The old Sultan (though his wistful invasions were a nuisance) was really much more acceptable to his fastidious taste.But still they were white; the periodical visits of the ship made a break in the well-filled sameness of the days without disturbing his privacy.Moreover, they were necessary from a business point of view; and through a strain of preciseness in his nature he was irritated when she failed to appear at the appointed time."
"船不能按时来到的理由太荒唐了，而马西呢，在他看来，就是个可鄙的白痴。在签了新协定以后，苏法拉号第一次从下面的河湾里拐出来，重新出现的时候，他几乎已经死了心，不指望再看到那艘船了，他窝了一肚子火，并没有马上到靠岸的地方去。仆人们纷纷向他跑来，报告消息。他拉了一张椅子，紧靠着阳台正面的栏杆，伸出两个胳膊肘，下巴搁在双手上，瞪着眼一直盯着那艘船看，这时船在他的房子对面拴缆绳。他能轻易地认出船上那些白人的脸。他们找来的那个现在待在驾驶台上的仪表堂堂的老人，究竟是个什么样的人呢？","The cause of the irregularity was too absurd, and Massy, in his opinion, was a contemptible idiot.The first time the Sofala reappeared under the new agreement swinging out of the bend below, after he had almost given up all hope of ever seeing her again, he felt so angry that he did not go down at once to the landing-place.His servants had come running to him with the news, and he had dragged a chair close against the front rail of the veranda, spread his elbows out, rested his chin on his hands, and went on glaring at her fixedly while she was being made fast opposite his house.He could make out easily all the white faces on board.Who on earth was that kind of patriarch they had got there on the bridge now?"
"他终于跳起身来，从那条砾石小路上走了下去。实际上，就连那些铺路的砾石也是苏法拉号给他运来的。因为恼火，他撇开沉默的高傲态度，没有向左右两边的人看上一眼，马上神情很坚决地招呼马西，那个轮机长吓了一跳，开始结结巴巴、含含糊糊地说活。什么也听不清楚，只听到这几句：“范怀克先生……真的，范怀克先生……将来，范怀克先生……”由于血往上涌，马西神情暴躁的大脸变成不正常的橙红色，脸上那双仓皇失措的黑眼睛闪着异乎寻常的光芒。","At last he sprang up and walked down the gravel path.It was a fact that the very gravel for his paths had been imported by the Sofala.Exasperated out of his quiet superciliousness, without looking at anyone right or left, he accosted Massy straightway in so determined a manner that the engineer, taken aback, began to stammer unintelligibly.Nothing could be heard but the words: “Mr. Van Wyk...Indeed, Mr. Van Wyk...For the future, Mr. Van Wyk”—and by the suffusion of blood Massy’s vast bilious face acquired an unnatural orange tint, out of which the disconcerted coal-black eyes shone in an extraordinary manner."
"“胡说。我对这一套已经听得腻烦了。我真是不明白，你怎么能这样放肆地把船横靠在我的码头上，好像我是为了你一个人的便利才建这个码头的。”","“Nonsense.I am tired of this.I wonder you have the impudence to come alongside my jetty as if I had it made for your convenience alone.” "
"马西试着尽力替自己辩护。范怀克先生非常生气。他很想通知那家德囯公司——那些在马六甲的人——他们叫什么来着——那些有绿烟囱的船。他们当然很乐意派一艘他们的小轮船来跑这个地方。可不是，施尼茨勒，雅各布·施尼茨勒，马上就会派来。可不是。他已经决定了，不再耽搁，马上就写。","Massy tried to protest earnestly.Mr. Van Wyk was very angry.He had a good mind to ask that German firm—those people in Malacca—what was their name?—boats with green funnels.They would be only too glad of the opening to put one of their small steamers on the run.Yes; Schnitzler, Jacob Schnitzler, would in a moment.Yes.He had decided to write without delay."
"马西在冲动中一把抓住他那个正往下掉的烟斗。","In his agitation Massy caught up his falling pipe."
"“你这话不是当真的，先生! ”他尖叫起来。","“You don’t mean it, sir!” he shrieked."
"“你不该用这么可笑的态度把你的业务搞得一团糟。” ","“You shouldn’t mismanage your business in this ridiculous manner.” "
"范怀克先生猛地转过身去。驾驶台上另外三个白人在他们两人拌嘴的时候，一动也不动。马西急急忙忙地走来走去，鼓起了腮帮子，气也透不出来。    ","Mr. Van Wyk turned on his heel.The other three whites on the bridge had not stirred during the scene.Massy walked hastily from side to side, puffed out his cheeks, suffocated."
"“傲慢的荷兰佬!”","“Stuck up Dutchman!” "
"接着他发了狂似的用哼哼唧唧的声调倾吐他漫长的伤心史。多少年来，他花了多少气力去讨好那个人。这就是你得到的回报吗，嗯？真是太好了。写信给施尼茨勒——把绿烟囱的船弄进来——让一个汉堡的老犹太人来毁掉他。这怎么可能，他简直要笑了……他呜咽地笑起来……哈！哈！哈！还可能要用他自己的船带这封信。","And he moaned out feverishly a long tale of griefs.The efforts he had made for all these years to please that man.This was the return you got for it, eh?Pretty.Write to Schnitzler—let in the green-funnel boats—get an old Hamburg Jew to ruin him.No, really he could laugh....He laughed sobbingly....Ha! ha! ha!And make him carry the letter in his own ship presumably."
"他磕磕绊绊地走过一片格栅，赌咒发誓地乱骂一通。他会毫不犹豫地把那个荷兰人的信件——该死的整整一大捆，都扔到水里去。他从来没有，没有为捎信件收过费。然而，惠利船长，他的新合伙人，也许不会让他这么办。再说这也只是把不幸推迟一些日子罢了。就他自己来说，他情愿扑通一声跳到水里去，也不愿驯服地看那些绿烟囱毁掉他的买卖。","He stumbled across a grating and swore.He would not hesitate to fling the Dutchman’s correspondence overboard—the whole confounded bundle.He had never, never made any charge for that accommodation.But Captain Whalley, his new partner, would not let him probably; besides, it would be only putting off the evil day.For his own part he would make a hole in the water rather than look on tamely at the green funnels overrunning his trade."
"他大声地咆哮着。那些中国侍者端着盘子站在扶梯脚旁，不敢再向前走。他从驾驶台向下面的甲板大声喊叫：“我们今天晚上难道没有一点东西可以吃了吗？”然后他猛地向惠利船长转过身去，那个船长等在餐桌的首座旁，庄严而耐心，时不时带着容忍的态度默默地摸摸他的大胡子。","He raved aloud.The China boys hung back with the dishes at the foot of the ladder.He yelled from the bridge down at the deck, “Aren’t we going to have any chow this evening at all?” then turned violently to Captain Whalley, who waited, grave and patient, at the head of the table, smoothing his beard in silence now and then with a forbearing gesture."
"“你看来好像并不关心我遇到的事情。难道你看不出这不但影响我的利益，也影响你的利益吗？这可不是开玩笑的事情。”","“You don’t seem to care what happens to me.Don’t you see that this affects your interests as much as mine?It’s no joking matter.” "
"他在餐桌的末座上坐下来，咬着牙吼叫。","He took the foot of the table growling between his teeth."
"“除非你在什么地方有几千镑。我可没有。”","“Unless you have a few thousands put away somewhere.I haven’t.” "
"范怀克先生在他灯火通明的房子里吃晚饭，使黑夜里黑漆漆的河岸上他开辟出来的那片空地有了一点亮光。然后，他坐在他的钢琴前面；在琴声暂时停下的时候，他听到正面的小路上传来缓缓的脚步声。有一两块木板在沉重的脚步下发出嘎吱嘎吱的响声。他在琴凳上半转过身去，手指尖放在键盘上留心听着。他那条狗汪汪乱叫着从阳台上退进来。一个低沉的声音庄重地为“这次闯入”道歉。他很快地走了出去。","Mr. Van Wyk dined in his thoroughly lit-up bungalow, putting a point of splendor in the night of his clearing above the dark bank of the river.Afterwards he sat down to his piano, and in a pause he became aware of slow footsteps passing on the path along the front.A plank or two creaked under a heavy tread; he swung half round on the music-stool, listening with his fingertips at rest on the keyboard.His little terrier barked violently, backing in from the veranda.A deep voice apologized gravely for “this intrusion.” He walked out quickly."
"在台阶的最上层，那个仪表堂堂的老人屹立着，不再前进。他分明是苏法拉号的新船长（他看到过约摸十二三个那艘船的船长，但是没有一个像他那样）。那条小狗不停地叫着，直到范怀克先生用手绢轻轻掸了它一下，它才跳开去不再吠叫。惠利船长说明了来意，但是受到了严格合乎礼貌但是坚决的反对。","At the head of the steps the patriarchal figure, who was the new captain of the Sofala apparently (he had seen a round dozen of them, but not one of that sort), towered without advancing.The little dog barked unceasingly, till a flick of Mr. Van Wyk’s handkerchief made him spring aside into silence.Captain Whalley, opening the matter, was met by a punctiliously polite but determined opposition."
"他们站在面对面遇到的地方接着讨论。范怀克先生仔细观察他的来客。最后，他好像好不容易才改变了他冷淡的态度，逼出了这样一句话：","They carried on their discussion standing where they had come face to face.Mr. Van Wyk observed his visitor with attention.Then at last, as if forced out of his reserve— "
"“我真觉得惊奇，你竟然会为这么一个该死的蠢货说情。”","“I am surprised that you should intercede for such a confounded fool.” "
"这句表示不满的话听起来几乎是在夸奖，好像它的意思是: “你这么一个人竟然会来说情! ”惠利船长只当它是耳旁风，毫不泄气。别人会以为他没有听到。他只是一再地说，他个人希望他们两个人能解决这个矛盾。个人……","This outbreak was almost complimentary, as if its meaning had been, “That such a man as you should intercede!” Captain Whalley let it pass by without flinching.One would have thought he had heard nothing.He simply went on to state that he was personally interested in putting things straight between them.Personally..."
"但是范怀克先生确实对马西讨厌极了，抑制不住他的怒火, 变得非常尖刻：","But Mr. Van Wyk, really carried away by his disgust with Massy, became very incisive— "
"“说真的——要是我必须坦白地跟你说的话——在我看来，他的整个品德并不特别值得尊重，或者说不值得信任……”","“Indeed—if I am to be frank with you—his whole character does not seem to me particularly estimable or trustworthy...” "
"惠利船长总是身子笔挺，这个时候似乎长高了一些，也宽了一些，好像他的胸围在他的大胡子下面突然扩大了。","Captain Whalley, always straight, seemed to grow an inch taller and broader, as if the girth of his chest had suddenly expanded under his beard."
"“亲爱的先生，你想不到我来这里是为了谈论一个跟我——跟我——嗯——关系很密切的人。” ","“My dear sir, you don’t think I came here to discuss a man with whom I am—I am—h’m—closely associated.” "
"有些严肃的沉默持续了片刻。他不习惯求别人，但是这件事情对他来说关系重大，使他愿意尝试一下……范怀克先生对他产生了同情，突然他想笑了，气也消了，打断了他的话说：","A sort of solemn silence lasted for a moment.He was not used to asking favors, but the importance he attached to this affair had made him willing to try....Mr. Van Wyk, favorably impressed, and suddenly mollified by a desire to laugh, interrupted— "
"“你如果把它作为跟你个人有关的事情的话，那就算了。不过，你得跟我一起坐上片刻，抽一支雪茄。”","“That’s all right if you make it a personal matter; but you can do no less than sit down and smoke a cigar with me.” "
"稍微停顿了一下，惠利船长沉重地向前走去。至于将来船的准时到达问题，他来负责。他叫惠利——也许对一个海员来说（他是在跟一个海员说话，不是吗？）不会从来没有听说过。现在有一座灯塔，在一个岛上。也许范怀克先生自己……","A slight pause, then Captain Whalley stepped forward heavily.As to the regularity of the service, for the future he made himself responsible for it; and his name was Whalley—perhaps to a sailor (he was speaking to a sailor, was he not?) not altogether unfamiliar.There was a lighthouse now, on an island.Maybe Mr. Van Wyk himself..."
"“啊，是啊。啊，真的。”范怀克先生立刻就领会了。他指了指一张椅子。真有趣。就他自己来说，他在上次的阿肯战争中虽然参加过战斗，可是从没有去过那么遥远的东方。惠利岛？ 当然听说过。真是有趣极了。他的客人从那以后一定经历了很大的变化。","“Oh yes.Oh indeed.” Mr. Van Wyk caught on at once.He indicated a chair.How very interesting.For his own part he had seen some service in the last Acheen War, but had never been so far East.Whalley Island?Of course.Now that was very interesting.What changes his guest must have seen since."
"“我甚至能回顾得更远——足足能回顾半个世纪。” ","“I can look further back even—on a whole half-century.” "
"惠利船长心情舒畅一些了。高级雪茄的芳香（这是他的嗜好），还有那个年轻人彬彬有礼的态度，瞬间倾注到了他的心里。在这次偶然的见面中，有一种他在那些奋斗的年月里一直渴望着的东西。","Captain Whalley expanded a bit.The flavor of a good cigar (it was a weakness) had gone straight to his heart, also the civility of that young man.There was something in that accidental contact of which he had been starved in his years of struggle."
"前墙凹了进去，形成一个方正的壁龛，布置得像个房间。倾斜的高屋顶下，有一盏罩着奶白色玻璃灯罩的灯，挂在倾斜的屋顶下一根细铜链上，一圈明亮的灯光照在一张小桌上，桌子上放着一本摊开的书和一把象牙裁纸刀。灯光外半透明的阴影里，还可以看到别的桌子和各式各样的安乐椅，阳台上的柚木地板上到处都铺着兽皮毯。开花的藤蔓使空气中充满了芳香。支架之间的藤叶都被剪去，仿佛好几架稠密的一动也不动的叶子，被灯光映照得绿幽幽的。惠利船长从胳膊肘边的空处望出去，能看到岸边苏法拉号舷梯口的那盏灯模模糊糊地亮着，看到那条开阔的、闪着微光的、黑魆魆的河以及河后面黑影幢幢的市镇，还看到狭长的、一片繁星灿烂的黑夜，好像挂在突出的屋檐笔直的边上似的。他手里夹着名牌雪茄，一时变得自鸣得意起来。","The front wall retreating made a square recess furnished like a room.A lamp with a milky glass shade, suspended below the slope of the high roof at the end of a slender brass chain, threw a bright round of light upon a little table bearing an open book and an ivory paper-knife.And, in the translucent shadows beyond, other tables could be seen, a number of easy-chairs of various shapes, with a great profusion of skin rugs strewn on the teakwood planking all over the veranda.The flowering creepers scented the air.Their foliage clipped out between the uprights made as if several frames of thick unstirring leaves reflecting the lamplight in a green glow.Through the opening at his elbow Captain Whalley could see the gangway lantern of the Sofala burning dim by the shore, the shadowy masses of the town beyond the open lustrous darkness of the river, and, as if hung along the straight edge of the projecting eaves, a narrow black strip of the night sky full of stars—resplendent.The famous cigar in hand he had a moment of complacency."
"“这是一件小事情。总得有个人带路。我只是证明这件事办得到罢了。然而，你们这些人学的是使用水蒸气，无法想象我那个冒险的举动对当时的东方贸易有多么巨大的重要性。嘿，足足有半年多的时间，这条新路线平均缩短了这条南方航线十一天的时间。十一天啊！那是有记录的。不过有件值得注意的事情——对一个海员来说——我应该说的是……”","“A trifle.Somebody must lead the way.I just showed that the thing could be done; but you men brought up to the use of steam cannot conceive the vast importance of my bit of venturesomeness to the Eastern trade of the time.Why, that new route reduced the average time of a southern passage by eleven days for more than half the year.Eleven days!It’s on record.But the remarkable thing—speaking to a sailor—I should say was...” "
"他说话得体，没有自吹自擂的神情，完全是专业的语气。他说话的声音沉着有力而且毫不费劲，充满在这间平房里，甚至传到了那些空房间里去，引起深沉而清楚的回音，似乎使外面格外寂静。范怀克先生对他声调的安详感到惊奇，认为这是男性文雅的典型。他摸着自己搁在膝盖上那只穿着丝袜和漆皮鞋的小小的脚，津津有味地听着。如今好像没有人能这么说话了；而且，那笼罩在阴影中的眼睛、飘拂的白胡子、巨大的身躯、安详的神态——这个人整体的气质，都像是史前时代的世界上让人惊奇的幸存者，从海洋中来到了他面前。","He talked well, without egotism, professionally.The powerful voice, produced without effort, filled the bungalow even into the empty rooms with a deep and limpid resonance, seemed to make a stillness outside; and Mr. Van Wyk was surprised by the serene quality of its tone, like the perfection of manly gentleness.Nursing one small foot, in a silk sock and a patent leather shoe, on his knee, he was immensely entertained.It was as if nobody could talk like this now, and the overshadowed eyes, the flowing white beard, the big frame, the serenity, the whole temper of the man, were an amazing survival from the prehistoric times of the world coming up to him out of the sea."
"惠利船长还是渤海湾早期贸易的开拓者。他甚至找到机会提起二十六年前他在那里埋葬了他“亲爱的妻子”。范怀克先生不露声色，可脑子里却不由自主地迅速猜测，和这样一个男人配成夫妻的会是一个怎么样的女人呢。他们是富于冒险性的、非常相配的一对吗？不。很可能她个子很小，很瘦弱，毫无疑问很女性化——要不，很可能生性勤于家务而显得俗气，完全无足轻重。但是惠利船长压根本不是一个唠叨的令人讨厌的人。他摇摇头，似乎要驱散暂时笼罩在他那张漂亮的老脸上的阴云似的，在谈话中暗暗地提到范怀克先生的孤独。","Captain Whalley had been also the pioneer of the early trade in the Gulf of Pe-tchi-li.He even found occasion to mention that he had buried his “dear wife” there six-and-twenty years ago.Mr. Van Wyk, impassive, could not help speculating in his mind swiftly as to the sort of woman that would mate with such a man.Did they make an adventurous and well-matched pair?No.Very possible she had been small, frail, no doubt very feminine—or most likely commonplace with domestic instincts, utterly insignificant.But Captain Whalley was no garrulous bore, and shaking his head as if to dissipate the momentary gloom that had settled on his handsome old face, he alluded conversationally to Mr. Van Wyk’s solitude."
"范怀克先生断言，有时候他的客人比他想要的更多。他微笑着提到他和“我的苏丹”在交往中一些特别之处。苏丹带领大量的人员来访。那些人损坏了他前门外的草地（在热带，要培养一片草地可不是件容易的事），前几天毁掉了一些他种在那里的珍贵灌木。惠利船长顿时想起了在一八四七年，那时的苏丹，也就是 “这个人的爷爷”，是从更远的东方来的海盗快帆船队的臭名昭著的保护人。这伙海盗在巴都贝鲁的河里都有安全的庇护所在。他特地为一个叫哈伊·达曼的巴里尼尼海盗头子掌管钱财。惠利船长意味深长地动动他浓密的白眉毛，他有很好的理由知道一些这样的事情。从那以后，世界就进步了。","Mr. Van Wyk affirmed that sometimes he had more company than he wanted.He mentioned smilingly some of the peculiarities of his intercourse with “My Sultan.”He made his visits in force.Those people damaged his grass plot in front (it was not easy to obtain some approach to a lawn in the tropics) and the other day had broken down some rare bushes he had planted over there.And Captain Whalley remembered immediately that, in ’forty-seven, the then Sultan, “this man’s grandfather,” had been notorious as a great protector of the piratical fleets of praus from farther East.They had a safe refuge in the river at Batu Beru.He financed more especially a Balinini chief called Haji Daman.Captain Whalley, nodding significantly his bushy white eyebrows, had very good reason to know something of that.The world had progressed since that time."
"范怀克先生用意想不到的刻薄口吻反驳。在什么方面有进步？他倒想要知道。","Mr. Van Wyk demurred with unexpected acrimony.Progressed in what? he wanted to know."
"嗯，在掌握事实真相方面，在做人正派方面，在正义方面，在秩序方面——还有在诚实方面，因为人们互相伤害主要是出于无知。惠利船长措辞文雅地下了一个结论，生活在这个世界上变得更有趣了。","Why, in knowledge of truth, in decency, in justice, in order—in honesty too, since men harmed each other mostly from ignorance.It was, Captain Whalley concluded quaintly, more pleasant to live in."
"范怀克先生异想天开地表示不承认；他举例说，马西先生自然不比巴里尼尼海盗更有趣。","Mr. Van Wyk whimsically would not admit that Mr. Massy, for instance, was more pleasant naturally than the Balinini pirates."
"这条河两岸的人并没有从变化中得到多大好处。他们是本本分分地按他们的生活方式过日子的。不用说，马西没有哈伊·达曼那么凶恶，可是……","The river had not gained much by the change.They were in their way every bit as honest.Massy was less ferocious than Haji Daman no doubt, but..."
"“那么，我的好先生，你怎么样呢？”惠利船长发出一阵深沉而温和的笑声，“你当然代表着进步。”","“And what about you, my good sir?” Captain Whalley laughed a deep soft laugh.“@You@ are an improvement, surely.” "
"他继续保持着爱开玩笑的性情。一支好雪茄比脑袋上狠狠地挨一下更好——这样的欢迎，四五十年以前他会在这条河上得到的。然后他探出身子，变得认真严肃起来。那些在海面上干无本买卖的人，除了他们自己那些在海面上飘泊无定的同伙以外，似乎对全人类抱着不可理解的、非杀不可的憎恨。一旦他们的抢劫被制止了，结果怎么样呢？新的一代人安份守己、太太平平地定居在富裕的村子里。他可以根据亲身见闻谈论这个事实。甚至还有几个那时候的人活着——现在都是老人了——也有了很大的变化，牢牢记住他们一生中曾经割断过别人的喉咙这笔老帐，不是宽宏大量的行为。他心中就有一个印象很深的人，在坦帕苏克西南大约六十英里的地方，一个沿海岸的大村子里受人尊敬的年老的头人。看到他这个人——听到他说话，人人都觉得高兴。他以前可能是一个凶狠的野人。人们需要被优越的智力制约，被优越的知识制约，还要被优越的力量制约——可不是嘛，被上帝赋予的力量制约，而且人们还要按照上帝公开宣称的意志，运用这种力量来洗清他们的罪孽。惠利船长相信，人本性都是善良的，哪怕这个世界，整个说来不是一个很愉快的地方。他对人的智慧并没有很多的信任。他承认有时候本性不得不受到严厉地扶助。人们可能愚蠢、固执、不快乐；可是天性邪恶——没有这回事。至少在心底里完全是无害的……","He continued in a vein of pleasantry.A good cigar was better than a knock on the head—the sort of welcome he would have found on this river forty or fifty years ago.Then leaning forward slightly, he became earnestly serious.It seems as if, outside their own sea-gypsy tribes, these rovers had hated all mankind with an incomprehensible, bloodthirsty hatred.Meantime their depredations had been stopped, and what was the consequence?The new generation was orderly, peaceable, settled in prosperous villages.He could speak from personal knowledge.And even the few survivors of that time—old men now—had changed so much, that it would have been unkind to remember against them that they had ever slit a throat in their lives.He had one especially in his mind’s eye: a dignified, venerable headman of a certain large coast village about sixty miles sou’west of Tampasuk.It did one’s heart good to see him—to hear that man speak.He might have been a ferocious savage once.What men wanted was to be checked by superior intelligence, by superior knowledge, by superior force too—yes, by force held in trust from God and sanctified by its use in accordance with His declared will.Captain Whalley believed a disposition for good existed in every man, even if the world were not a very happy place as a whole.In the wisdom of men he had not so much confidence.The disposition had to be helped up pretty sharply sometimes, he admitted.They might be silly, wrongheaded, unhappy; but naturally evil—no.There was at bottom a complete harmlessness at least..."
"“是那样吗？”范怀克先生刻薄地打断他的话。","“Is there?” Mr. Van Wyk snapped acrimoniously."
"听到他这么插嘴，惠利船长带着容忍和充满信心的神情，兴致勃勃地笑起来。他指出，他能够回顾半个世纪的事情。一缕青烟静静地透过遮住他谈吐亲切的嘴唇的白胡子冒出来。","Captain Whalley laughed at the interjection, in the good humor of large, tolerating certitude.He could look back at half a century, he pointed out.The smoke oozed placidly through the white hairs hiding his kindly lips."
"“不管怎样，”他停顿了一下以后，接着说，“他们到现在为止还没有时间给你造成很大的损害，我感到高兴。”","“At all events,” he resumed after a pause, “I am glad that they’ve had no time to do you much harm as yet.” "
"这句话是暗指范怀克先生还比较年轻，却没有惹得他生气。他站起来，带着一丝神情暧昧的笑意扭扭肩膀。他们一起友好地走出房子，在星光灿烂的夜晚向河边走去。他们的脚步在黑魆魆的小路上发出不均匀的响声。在舷梯靠岸的一头，那盏灯挂得很低，从扶手旁，清楚地照出了马西先生雪白的大腿和漆黑的大脚，他焦急地等在那里。他腰以上的部分仍然在黑影里，只见一溜闪着微光的钮扣一直上升到他轮廓模糊的下巴底下。","This allusion to his comparative youthfulness did not offend Mr. Van Wyk, who got up and wriggled his shoulders with an enigmatic half-smile.They walked out together amicably into the starry night towards the river-side.Their footsteps resounded unequally on the dark path.At the shore end of the gangway the lantern, hung low to the handrail, threw a vivid light on the white legs and the big black feet of Mr. Massy waiting about anxiously.From the waist upwards he remained shadowy, with a row of buttons gleaming up to the vague outline of his chin."
"“你应该为这件事感谢惠利船长。”范怀克先生在转过身以前，草草地对他说。 ","“You may thank Captain Whalley for this,” Mr. Van Wyk said curtly to him before turning away."
"在比草地高许多的柱子中间，阳台上的灯投下三道长长的灯光。一只蝙蝠像一片盘旋的黑天鹅绒似的，从他面前掠过。沿着淡黄色的树篱，芳香的露水滴下来，夜晚的空气似乎变得使人懒洋洋起来。小路两旁是一个个的花坛。房子前面，到处屹立着黑魆魆、圆滚滚的一丛丛修剪过的灌木。房子前面的藤蔓那密密匝匝的叶子把房子正面的一溜灯光过滤得光线柔和。远近的一切都静悄悄地屹立在浓郁的芳香中，一动不动。","The lamps on the veranda flung three long squares of light between the uprights far over the grass.A bat flitted before his face like a circling flake of velvety blackness.Along the jasmine hedge the night air seemed heavy with the fall of perfumed dew; flowerbeds bordered the path; the clipped bushes uprose in dark rounded clumps here and there before the house; the dense foliage of creepers filtered the sheen of the lamplight within in a soft glow all along the front; and everything near and far stood still in a great immobility, in a great sweetness."
"范怀克先生（几年前，他有理由设想自己受到了一个女人的亏待，世界上没有一个人受到过比这更糟糕的对待了）从前也是个轻信的人，因此对惠利船长的乐观看法感到轻视。他对这个世界（那个女人一度使他感到世界是完全充实的）的憎恶是以退休生活的形式表现出来的，因为他虽然有着深沉丰富的感情，却精力充沛，本质上是讲究实际的。但是那个非同寻常的老海员，出没在他忙碌而孤独的生活周围，却以一种魅力吸引着他这个怀疑一切的人。他那很纯朴的态度（非常有趣）却像一个性格正直的人的文雅、高尚的举止。一个落到了这么低微的地位的人，居然能表现出这么引人注目的庄严行为，不可能是别的，只可能是他性格中那种真正高尚的气质的表现。尽管他完全信任人类，可他绝不是个蠢货。他活了这许多年头，已经到了垂暮之年，他那宁静的气质有一种非常明智的神气，显然不是成功的处境酝酿出来的。范怀克先生有时对这些很感兴趣。甚至这位苏法拉号老船长的体质，他硬朗的身子、安详的风度、聪明漂亮的容貌、巨大的四肢、亲切的礼貌以及浓密的眉毛所显出的轻微的严厉神情，都使他成为一个富有魅力的人。范怀克先生不喜欢各种小家子气的东西，可是那个人身上没有一样东西跟“小家子气”沾边。经过了多次可以作为范例的准时航行，他们两人的关系亲密起来了。在他亲切而庄重的态度掩盖下，有着一颗热情洋溢的心。这正投合他那爱挑剔的脾气。","Mr. Van Wyk (a few years before he had had occasion to imagine himself treated more badly than anybody alive had ever been by a woman) felt for Captain Whalley’s optimistic views the disdain of a man who had once been credulous himself.His disgust with the world (the woman for a time had filled it for him completely) had taken the form of activity in retirement, because, though capable of great depth of feeling, he was energetic and essentially practical.But there was in that uncommon old sailor, drifting on the outskirts of his busy solitude, something that fascinated his skepticism.His very simplicity (amusing enough) was like a delicate refinement of an upright character.The striking dignity of manner could be nothing else, in a man reduced to such a humble position, but the expression of something essentially noble in the character.With all his trust in mankind he was no fool; the serenity of his temper at the end of so many years, since it could not obviously have been appeased by success, wore an air of profound wisdom.Mr. Van Wyk was amused at it sometimes.Even the very physical traits of the old captain of the Sofala, his powerful frame, his reposeful mien, his intelligent, handsome face, the big limbs, the benign courtesy, the touch of rugged severity in the shaggy eyebrows, made up a seductive personality.Mr. Van Wyk disliked littleness of every kind, but there was nothing small about that man, and in the exemplary regularity of many trips an intimacy had grown up between them, a warm feeling at bottom under a kindly stateliness of forms agreeable to his fastidiousness."
"他们对世俗的事务保留着各自不同的意见。惠利船长从不干扰他的其他信念。他们的年纪差别，好像是两个人另一条友情纽带。有一次，范怀克先生受到揶揄，被称为性子苛刻的年轻人，眼睛骨碌碌地打量着他那个大个子伙伴，用友好的逗笑口气反驳：","They kept their respective opinions on all worldly matters.His other convictions Captain Whalley never intruded.The difference of their ages was like another bond between them.Once, when twitted with the uncharitableness of his youth, Mr. Van Wyk, running his eye over the vast proportions of his interlocutor, retorted in friendly banter— "
"“啊。你将来会跟我的想法一样的。你还要活许多日子。别说你自己老了。你看来能活上整整一百岁。” ","“Oh.You’ll come to my way of thinking yet.You’ll have plenty of time.Don’t call yourself old: you look good for a round hundred.” "
"但是他无法不说词锋犀利的刺人话；虽然用几乎洋溢着友情的微笑来冲淡这话的分量，他加上一句：","But he could not help his stinging incisiveness, and though moderating it by an almost affectionate smile, he added— "
"“到了那时候，你可能会完全出于厌恶，同意还是死了的好。” ","“And by then you will probably consent to die from sheer disgust.” "
"惠利船长也微笑着，摇摇头：“决不会有那种事！” ","Captain Whalley, smiling too, shook his head.“God forbid!” "
"他认为，他也许多半不会糟得带着这样的想法死去。那一天早晚会来的，他相信他的创造者会提供给他一个不需要害臊地离开人间的方式。至于其他方面，如果需要的话，他希望能活到一百岁。听说有一些人是能活到这个岁数的，这根本不是什么奇迹。他不指望有奇迹。","He thought that perhaps on the whole he deserved something better than to die in such sentiments.The time of course would have to come, and he trusted to his Maker to provide a manner of going out of which he need not be ashamed.For the rest he hoped he would live to a hundred if need be: other men had been known; it would be no miracle.He expected no miracles."
"他那明确的争辩语气使范怀克先生抬起头来，一直看着他。惠利船长带着入迷的表情直勾勾地盯着看，好像他看到造物主用莫名其妙的文字把他善良的意志写在墙上一样。他一动不动地待了几秒钟，然后庞大的身子猛地站起来，吓了范怀克先生一跳。","The pronounced, argumentative tone caused Mr. Van Wyk to raise his head and look at him steadily.Captain Whalley was gazing fixedly with a rapt expression, as though he had seen his Creator’s favorable decree written in mysterious characters on the wall.He kept perfectly motionless for a few seconds, then got his vast bulk on to his feet so impetuously that Mr. Van Wyk was startled."
"他先在鼓起的胸膛上重重捶了一拳，接着平伸出一条粗壮的胳膊，纹丝不动地横在了空中，犹如无风的天气里的一根树枝。","He struck first a heavy blow on his inflated chest: and, throwing out horizontally a big arm that remained steady, extended in the air like the limb of a tree on a windless day— "
"“身上没有哪个地方疼。你能看到一点哆嗦吗？”","“Not a pain or an ache there.Can you see this shake in the least?” "
"他的声音低低的，跟他的冒失而强调的动作形成了对比，使人望而生畏，无法不信。他突然坐下去。","His voice was low, in an awing, confident contrast with the headlong emphasis of his movements.He sat down abruptly."
"“这不是自吹自擂，你知道的。这算不了什么。”他用毫不费力的、浑厚的嗓音说，似乎跟河水的流动一样自然而然地冲口而出。他拿起摆在一边的那截雪茄烟头，微微点点头，平静地加上一句：“情况就是这样，偏偏还需要我活下去。我的生命不是我自己的，不是的——上帝知道。” ","“This isn’t to boast of it, you know.I am nothing,” he said in his effortless strong voice, that seemed to come out as naturally as a river flows.He picked up the stump of the cigar he had laid aside, and added peacefully, with a slight nod, “As it happens, my life is necessary; it isn’t my own, it isn’t—God knows.” "
"那天黄昏剩下的时间，他话说得不多，但是范怀克先生有几次发现他的大胡子底下掠过一丝自信的微笑。","He did not say much for the rest of the evening, but several times Mr. Van Wyk detected a faint smile of assurance flitting under the heavy mustache."
"从那以后，惠利船长会不时地同意到“那所房子”去吃晚饭。他甚至可以接受劝说喝上一杯。“别以为我害怕酒，我的好先生，” 他解释道，“我有充足的理由不喝酒。”","Later on Captain Whalley would now and then consent to dine “at the house.” He could even be induced to drink a glass of wine.“Don’t think I am afraid of it, my good sir,” he explained.“There was a very good reason why I should give it up.” "
"还有一次，他舒适地靠在椅子上，说：“你从一开始就对我非常——非常仁慈。”","On another occasion, leaning back at ease, he remarked, “You have treated me most—most humanely, my dear Mr. Van Wyk, from the very first.” "
"“你将来会承认这算得上一个优点，”范怀克先生俏皮地暗示，“那位了不起的马西的一个同事……得了，得了，亲爱的船长，我不想再说一句贬低他的话了。”","“You’ll admit there was some merit,” Mr. Van Wyk hinted slyly.“An associate of that excellent Massy....Well, well, my dear captain, I won’t say a word against him.” "
"“即使你说贬低他的话也没有用，”惠利船长有点沮丧地说，“我以前跟你说过，还需要我活下去——还需要我工作，并不是为了我自己一个人。我无法选择……”他停顿了一下，把他面前的那个玻璃杯转了一圈……“我只有一个孩子——一个女儿。”","“It would be no use your saying anything against him,” Captain Whalley affirmed a little moodily.“As I’ve told you before, my life—my work, is necessary, not for myself alone.I can’t choose”...He paused, turned the glass before him right round....“I have an only child—a daughter.” "
"他的胳膊大起大落地从桌子上往下一摆，仿佛在向人暗示远方的那个小姑娘。“在我去世以前，我希望能再看到她一回。在这期间只要知道她有我这个健康、硬朗的人就好，感谢上帝。你无法懂得人的感情是怎么回事。我的亲骨肉，长得跟我可怜的妻子一模一样。唉，她……”","The ample downward sweep of his arm over the table seemed to suggest a small girl at a vast distance.“I hope to see her once more before I die.Meantime it’s enough to know that she has me sound and solid, thank God.You can’t understand how one feels.Bone of my bone, flesh of my flesh; the very image of my poor wife.Well, she...” "
"他又停顿了一下，然后淡淡地说着：“她过得很艰难。”","Again he paused, then pronounced stoically the words, “She has a hard struggle.” "
"他的脑袋搭拉在胸前，眉头仍然皱着，像在苦苦地思索。但是通常他的心境似乎是平静的，因为他完全听任更高的力量去安排未来。范怀克先生有时不明白，这种情况有多少应归功于这个人出色的生命力，有多少应归功于他的体力，好像有一部分体力已经倾注到这个人的灵魂里去了。可是他变得非常喜欢这个人。","And his head fell on his breast, his eyebrows remained knitted, as by an effort of meditation.But generally his mind seemed steeped in the serenity of boundless trust in a higher power.Mr. Van Wyk wondered sometimes how much of it was due to the splendid vitality of the man, to the bodily vigor which seems to impart something of its force to the soul.But he had learned to like him very much."
"第十三章","XIII "
"这就是为什么在黑色静谧的船身旁边的岸上，当斯特恩先生急匆匆地把这个秘密告诉他，他平静的心境就被扰乱的原因。发生这样的事情，真是让人百思不得其解，万万也想不到。他的心里很乱，把信件的事情都完全忘了，匆匆忙忙地跑上驾驶台的扶梯。","This was the reason why Mr. Sterne’s confidential communication, delivered hurriedly on the shore alongside the dark silent ship, had disturbed his equanimity.It was the most incomprehensible and unexpected thing that could happen; and the perturbation of his spirit was so great that, forgetting all about his letters, he ran rapidly up the bridge ladder."
"两个有辫子的侍者正在舵轮的左面搭着饭桌，准备晚饭。那两个人跟平常一样为了工作互相恶狠狠地吆喝，而另一个人，一个面带愁容、身子结实、皮肤很黄、很像马西的中囯人无动于衷地等着，一条胳膊上搭着台布，一摞厚厚的盛菜盘子贴在胸前。一盏普通的船舱里的灯，没有了灯罩，从下面拿上来，挂在天篷的木架上。周围的帆布帘都放了下来。惠利船长坐在他的柳条椅上，把椅子填得满满的，他坐在一个灯光赤裸裸、用来堆放航海用具的帆布帐篷里，仿佛丧失了知觉一样。一个陈旧的舵轮、一个放在结实的红柳桉木架子上的破旧的铜罗经柜、两个邋遢的救生圈，角落里有两个软木碰垫，还有一些装着细绳环而不用门把的歪歪斜斜的甲板小舱。","The portable table was being put together for dinner to the left of the wheel by two pig-tailed “boys,” who as usual snarled at each other over the job, while another, a doleful, burly, very yellow Chinaman, resembling Mr. Massy, waited apathetically with the cloth over his arm and a pile of thick dinner-plates against his chest.A common cabin lamp with its globe missing, brought up from below, had been hooked to the wooden framework of the awning; the side-screens had been lowered all round; Captain Whalley filling the depths of the wicker-chair seemed to sit benumbed in a canvas tent crudely lighted, and used for the storing of nautical objects; a shabby steering-wheel, a battered brass binnacle on a stout mahogany stand, two dingy life-buoys, an old cork fender lying in a corner, dilapidated deck-lockers with loops of thin rope instead of door-handles."
"他摆脱了那副好像丧失了知觉的模样，回答范怀克先生那异乎寻常的活泼的招呼，但是马上又恢复了原来的样子。可以很清楚地看出，他接受一次时间紧迫的邀请，到“山上那所房子”去吃晚饭得花很大的劲。范怀克先生搞不清这是怎么回事，交叉着胳膊，背靠着栏杆，把他那双穿着闪闪发亮的黑漆皮鞋的小脚向外伸得很突出，暗暗地打量着他。 ","He shook off the appearance of numbness to return Mr. Van Wyk’s unusually brisk greeting, but relapsed directly afterwards.To accept a pressing invitation to dinner “up at the house” cost him another very visible physical effort.Mr. Van Wyk, perplexed, folded his arms, and leaning back against the rail, with his little, black, shiny feet well out, examined him covertly."
"“我近来注意到你精神不太好，老朋友。” ","“I’ve noticed of late that you are not quite yourself, old friend.” "
"他把“老朋友”三个字说得亲切而温和。他们的交往确实很亲密，但是这种关系以前从来没有表现得如此明显过。","He put an affectionate gentleness into the last two words.The real intimacy of their intercourse had never been so vividly expressed before."
"“啧，啧，啧！” ","“Tut, tut, tut!” "
"柳条椅发出刺耳的嘎吱嘎吱声。 ","The wicker-chair creaked heavily."
"“性情烦躁，”范怀克先生暗自发表看法，然后出声说，“那么，我希望半个小时以后看到你。”他大大咧咧地说，接着走掉了。","“Irritable,” commented Mr. Van Wyk to himself; and aloud, “I’ll expect to see you in half an hour, then,” he said negligently, moving off."
"“半个小时以后。”惠利船长似乎神情恍惚地在他身后重复着说，雪白的脑袋直挺挺的。","“In half an hour,” Captain Whalley’s rigid silvery head repeated behind him as if out of a trance."
"下面，在船的中部，轮机室附近，能够听到两个声音在谈话——一个声音愤怒而缓慢，另一个则是警觉的。","Amidships, below, two voices, close against the engineroom, could be heard answering each other—one angry and slow, the other alert."
"“我告诉你，那个畜生把自己锁在房间里，要喝一个烂醉。” ","“I tell you the beast has locked himself in to get drunk.” "
"“没有办法，马西先生。毕竟一个人有权利在不上班的时候，把自己锁在舱房里。” ","“Can’t help it now, Mr. Massy.After all, a man has a right to shut himself up in his cabin in his own time.” "
"“但是不能喝得烂醉。”","“Not to get drunk.” "
"“我刚才听到他赌咒发誓说，为锅炉担心能把任何一个人逼得喝个烂醉。”斯特恩恶毒地说。","“I heard him swear that the worry with the boilers was enough to drive any man to drink,” Sterne said maliciously."
"马西咬牙切齿地说了一些要把门砸开冲进去之类的话。范怀克先生避开他们，在黑暗中走到没有人的甲板对面去。小码头上的地板在他急促的脚步下，发出微微的咯咯声。 ","Massy hissed out something about bursting the door in.Mr. Van Wyk, to avoid them, crossed in the dark to the other side of the deserted deck.The planking of the little wharf rattled faintly under his hasty feet."
"“范怀克先生！范怀克先生!”","“Mr. Van Wyk!Mr. Van Wyk!” "
"他继续走去。有人在小路上跑起来。“你忘了取你的信件。” ","He walked on: somebody was running on the path.“You’ve forgotten to get your mail.” "
"斯特恩手里拿着一捆报刊，追上了他。","Sterne, holding a bundle of papers in his hand, caught up with him."
"“啊，谢谢。”","“Oh, thanks.” "
"但是那个人继续跟在他身旁，范怀克先生突然站住了脚。平房突出的屋檐倾斜下来，低低地罩在点着灯的房子正面，把他们黑魆魆的、轮廓直挺挺的影子抛进那边的茫茫黑夜。一切都静悄悄的。只听到刀叉的当啷声和玻璃杯的轻微叮当声。范怀克先生的仆人在阳台上把两个人用饭的餐具摆在桌上。","But, as the other continued at his elbow, Mr. Van Wyk stopped short.The overhanging eaves, descending low upon the lighted front of the bungalow, threw their black straight-edged shadow into the great body of the night on that side.Everything was very still.A tinkle of cutlery and a slight jingle of glasses were heard.Mr. Van Wyk’s servants were laying the table for two on the veranda."
"“我怕把那件事情告诉你，你一点也没有领会我的好意。” 斯特恩说。","“I’m afraid you give me no credit whatever for my good intentions in the matter I’ve spoken to you about,” said Sterne."
"“我只是不懂你的话。”","“I simply don’t understand you.” "
"“惠利船长是个肆无忌惮的人，然而他会明白他的那套把戏就要耍完了。任何人到我这里来需要了解的就是这件事情，就是这样。相信我，我在这方面是很体谅人的，可是职责有关，不能撂手不管。我不打算闹得满沸扬扬。”你作为他的朋友，我要求你的只是代我告诉他，那套把戏就要耍完了。这就够了。”","“Captain Whalley is a very audacious man, but he will understand that his game is up.That’s all that anybody need ever know of it from me.Believe me, I am very considerate in this, but duty is duty.I don’t want to make a fuss.All I ask you, as his friend, is to tell him from me that the game’s up.That will be sufficient.” "
"范怀克先生作为朋友，得到这样一个古怪的权利，感到既厌恶又沮丧。他才不会降低身份去要求一丝一毫的解释。盛气凌人地把这个人骂一通撵开，他认为这样未免太冒失——不管怎样，现在还不能这么做。那个人如此自信使他犹豫。他想，谁能说得上那到底是怎么回事？他对惠利船长尊重，却从来不存丝毫偏心，而且他讲究实际的本能终于起作用了，他隐藏了他的轻蔑。","Mr. Van Wyk felt a loathsome dismay at this queer privilege of friendship.He would not demean himself by asking for the slightest explanation; to drive the other away with contumely he did not think prudent—as yet, at any rate.So much assurance staggered him.Who could tell what there could be in it, he thought?His regard for Captain Whalley had the tenacity of a disinterested sentiment, and his practical instinct coming to his aid, he concealed his scorn."
"“那么，我猜想这件事情很严重。”","“I gather, then, that this is something grave.” "
"“很严重。”斯特恩一本正经地赞同道，想到终于产生了效果，心里感到高兴。他准备作一番热情洋溢的声明，对这种“不可避免的必要性”表示遗憾，但是范怀克先生打断了他的话——不过，很有礼貌。","“Very grave,” Sterne assented solemnly, delighted at having produced an effect at last.He was ready to add some effusive protestations of regret at the “unavoidable necessity,” but Mr. Van Wyk cut him short—very civilly, however."
"范怀克先生一走上阳台，双手就插在了衣袋里，叉开腿坐着，俯视着铺在安乐椅前地板上的一张黑豹皮。“看来这家伙好像没有胆子出头露面地玩他那套漂亮的把戏。”他想。 ","Once on the veranda Mr. Van Wyk put his hands in his pockets, and, straddling his legs, stared down at a black panther skin lying on the floor before a rocking-chair.“It looks as if the fellow had not the pluck to play his own precious game openly,” he thought."
"这个想法有道理。上次挨了马西的回绝，斯特恩不敢吐露他掌握的情况。他的目的只是要指挥那艘轮船，干上一段时期。他要是一味硬来的话，马西无论如何也不会饶他的。但是如果惠利船长自愿离开这艘船的话，那么在这次航行其余的路程中，船长这个职位就会移交给他。所以他想出这个高明的主意，想把那个老人吓走。一种模糊的威胁，仅仅一个暗示，用来对付这样一个不知羞耻的骗局也就够了；而且很奇怪，他还带着几分同情心的认为，巴都贝鲁是一个很好的认输的地方。那个船长可以悄悄地上岸去，和那个荷兰人呆在一起。这两个人不是亲密得不能分开吗？经过思考，他好像发现了一个办法，那就是通过老人的那位了不起的朋友来推动整个事情。这是另一个高明的主意。他生来喜欢拐弯抹角的办法。在这件事情中他也仍然希望尽可能地待在幕后，避免不必要地惹马西恼火。千万不要闹得沸沸扬扬！让一切自然而然地发生。","This was true enough.In the face of Massy’s last rebuff Sterne dared not declare his knowledge.His object was simply to get charge of the steamer and keep it for some time.Massy would never forgive him for forcing himself on; but if Captain Whalley left the ship of his own accord, the command would devolve upon him for the rest of the trip; so he hit upon the brilliant idea of scaring the old man away.A vague menace, a mere hint, would be enough in such a brazen case; and, with a strange admixture of compassion, he thought that Batu Beru was a very good place for throwing up the sponge.The skipper could go ashore quietly, and stay with that Dutchman of his.Weren’t these two as thick as thieves together?And on reflection he seemed to see that there was a way to work the whole thing through that great friend of the old man’s.This was another brilliant idea.He had an inborn preference for circuitous methods.In this particular case he desired to remain in the background as much as possible, to avoid exasperating Massy needlessly.No fuss!Let it all happen naturally."
"在整个晚餐过程中范怀克先生感到很孤独，这种感觉有时候人在亲密交往中也会忽然出现。惠利船长几次准备吃东西，但是模样可怜而明显地没有吃成。他好像被一种奇怪的心不在焉的心情所摆布，身不由己。他的手会犹豫不决地摇晃起来，似乎在想心事，没有注意到手的动作一样。范怀克先生刚才在寂静无声中听到他从河边远远地走来，发觉他的脚步犹豫不决。他的靴尖踢着最低一磴台阶，好像他抬着头，想得走神了，一个劲地要登上阳台台阶似的。如果苏法拉号船长是另一种人的话，他会怀疑这是年老的缘故。可是对他瞟上一眼就够了。时间确实在他身上留下了痕迹——但是从此以后，却撂下他不管了，让他自己做个有用的人，他凭着单纯的信仰就会看到这种情况是上帝仁慈的一个证据。“我自己怎么可能去提醒他呢？” 范怀克先生不确定，似乎惠利船长在很远很远的地方，既看不见又听不到一切邪恶的东西一样。他对斯特恩厌恶透了。甚至把斯特恩的威胁向惠利船长这样的人转告都觉得不妥当。在他的暗示中，有一种比明显的犯罪更为下流、更为侮辱人的东西——带有几分卑鄙的讹诈性质。“有谁能用什么来反对他呢？” 他问自己。这是一个性情恬淡的人。“而且，为了什么目的呢？” 那个人信任的冥冥中的力量认为合适的安排应该是，除了让他吃一口苦饭以外，不再让他在这个世界上得到任何东西，免得他可能受到忌妒暗算。","Mr. Van Wyk all through the dinner was conscious of a sense of isolation that invades sometimes the closeness of human intercourse.Captain Whalley failed lamentably and obviously in his attempts to eat something.He seemed overcome by a strange absentmindedness.His hand would hover irresolutely, as if left without guidance by a preoccupied mind.Mr. Van Wyk had heard him coming up from a long way off in the profound stillness of the river-side, and had noticed the irresolute character of the footfalls.The toe of his boot had struck the bottom stair as though he had come along mooning with his head in the air right up to the steps of the veranda.Had the captain of the Sofala been another sort of man he would have suspected the work of age there.But one glance at him was enough.Time—after, indeed, marking him for its own—had given him up to his usefulness, in which his simple faith would see a proof of Divine mercy.“How could I contrive to warn him?” Mr. Van Wyk wondered, as if Captain Whalley had been miles and miles away, out of sight and earshot of all evil.He was sickened by an immense disgust of Sterne.To even mention his threat to a man like Whalley would be positively indecent.There was something more vile and insulting in its hint than in a definite charge of crime—the debasing taint of blackmailing.“What could anyone bring against him?” he asked himself.This was a limpid personality.“And for what object?” The Power that man trusted had thought fit to leave him nothing on earth that envy could lay hold of, except a bare crust of bread."
"“你不尝尝这些吗？”他一边说一边把一个盘子微微推了一下。范怀克先生似乎突然想到，斯特恩看上的可能是苏法拉号船长这个职位。这似乎是一个证据，证明没有人可以自以为安全，不会受到他同类的算计，除非他已经陷入了痛苦的深渊。他认为，那样的一个阴谋几乎不值得费心；不过，跟马西这么一个蠢货打交道，惠利应该而且必须提前得到提醒。","“Won’t you try some of this?” he asked, pushing a dish slightly.Suddenly it seemed to Mr. Van Wyk that Sterne might possibly be coveting the command of the Sofala.His cynicism was quite startled by what looked like a proof that no man may count himself safe from his kind unless in the very abyss of misery.An intrigue of that sort was hardly worth troubling about, he judged; but still, with such a fool as Massy to deal with, Whalley ought to and must be warned."
"这时候，惠利船长突然身子挺得笔直；浓密的眉毛紧皱着，突出在眼窝上；两只棕色的大手放在他的空盘子两边；隔着台布突然说：“范怀克先生，你一直对我非常同情和关心。”","At this moment Captain Whalley, bolt upright, the deep cavities of the eyes overhung by a bushy frown, and one large brown hand resting on each side of his empty plate, spoke across the tablecloth abruptly—“Mr. Van Wyk, you’ve always treated me with the most humane consideration.” "
"“亲爱的船长，你把我不是个野蛮人这件简单的事实说得太过分了。”范怀克先生想到斯特恩的隐晦的打算，感到非常厌恶，尖刻地提高声音，似乎那个大副躲在什么听得到的地方一样。“任何我能表示的关心，都是一个我现在带着不可动摇的尊重交往的人应该得到的，没有丝毫过分的地方。”","“My dear captain, you make too much of a simple fact that I am not a savage.” Mr. Van Wyk, utterly revolted by the thought of Sterne’s obscure attempt, raised his voice incisively, as if the mate had been hiding somewhere within earshot.“Any consideration I have been able to show was no more than the rightful due of a character I’ve learned to regard by this time with an esteem that nothing can shake.” "
"他原来低着头，正在把自己盘子里的菠萝切成小块。玻璃杯发出轻微的响声，使他抬起眼睛。惠利船长在改变坐姿的时候，竟然碰倒了一个空酒杯。","A slight ring of glass made him lift his eyes from the slice of pine-apple he was cutting into small pieces on his plate.In changing his position Captain Whalley had contrived to upset an empty tumbler."
"他没有向那个方向看去，身子从胳膊肘上斜探出来，另一只手遮在额头上，他哆哆嗦嗦地去摸那个酒杯，然后停止了。范怀克迷惑地盯着看，似乎突然发现了什么严重的事情似的。他不知道他为什么要这么吃惊，可是他当时完全把斯特恩忘了。","Without looking that way, leaning sideways on his elbow, his other hand shading his brow, he groped shakily for it, then desisted.Van Wyk stared blankly, as if something momentous had happened all at once.He did not know why he should feel so startled; but he forgot Sterne utterly for the moment."
"“啊呀，怎么啦？”","“Why, what’s the matter?” "
"惠利船长稍微转开了身子，用压低了的激动的声音轻轻地说：","And Captain Whalley, half-averted, in a deadened, agitated voice, muttered— "
" “尊重！”","“Esteem!” "
"“我对你可以说不止是尊重。”范怀克先生的眼光紧盯着，慢条斯理地说。","“And I may add something more,” Mr. Van Wyk, very steady-eyed, pronounced slowly."
"“别说了！够了!”惠利船长没有改变他的姿势，或者提高声音，“别再说了！我无法报答你。我现在穷得连报答都不行了。你的尊重值得被拥有。你这个人不会辱没自己的身份欺骗世界上那种最可怜的人，也不会每一次驾船出海的吋候，总是使那艘船不适合航海。”","“Hold!Enough!” Captain Whalley did not change his attitude or raise his voice.“Say no more!I can make you no return.I am too poor even for that now.Your esteem is worth having.You are not a man that would stoop to deceive the poorest sort of devil on earth, or make a ship unseaworthy every time he takes her to sea.” "
"范怀克先生探出了身子，脸涨得通红，浆过的餐巾铺在膝盖上，他简直要不相信自己的知觉和自己的理解力，不相信他的客人精神正常了。","Mr. Van Wyk, leaning forward, his face gone pink all over, with the starched table-napkin over his knees, was inclined to mistrust his senses, his power of comprehension, the sanity of his guest."
"“在哪里？为什么？看在上帝份上！——这到底是怎么回事？什么船？我不懂得谁……”","“Where?Why?In the name of God!—what’s this?What ship?I don’t understand who...” "
"“那么，对着上帝发誓，那个人就是我！一艘船的船长看不见的时候，那艘船是不适合航海的。我快变成瞎子了。” ","“Then, in the name of God, it is I!A ship’s unseaworthy when her captain can’t see.I am going blind.” "
"范怀克先生微微动了一下，接着一动不动地坐了几秒钟。后来他想起了斯特恩说的“那套把戏要耍完了”之类的话，弯下身去，把从膝盖上滑到桌子底下的餐巾拾起来。这就是拆穿了的把戏。这时候，惠利船长那压低了的声音从他身旁飘过： ","Mr. Van Wyk made a slight movement, and sat very still afterwards for a few seconds; then, with the thought of Sterne’s “The game’s up,” he ducked under the table to pick up the napkin which had slipped off his knees.This was the game that was up.And at the same time the muffled voice of Captain Whalley passed over him— "
"“我把他们都骗了。 没有人知道。”","“I’ve deceived them all.Nobody knows.” "
"他脸涨得通红，甚至眼睛也红了。惠利船长在亮得刺眼的灯光下一动也不动，一只手遮着脸。","He emerged flushed to the eyes.Captain Whalley, motionless under the full blaze of the lamp, shaded his face with his hand."
"“你有那么大的胆子？”","“And you had that courage?” "
"“你管它叫什么都行。然而，你是个富有同情心的人——一个高尚的人，范怀克先生。你本来可以问我怎样对付自己的良心的。”","“Call it by what name you like.But you are a humane man—a—a—gentleman, Mr. Van Wyk.You may have asked me what I had done with my conscience.” "
"他沉默不语，一副沮丧的姿势，一动也不动，好像在沉思。","He seemed to muse, profoundly silent, very still in his mournful pose."
"“在开始的时候，我狂妄行事。在你快要变成瞎子的时候，你却开始看到许多事情。我甚至跟老朋友都没法吐露真情。我没有向马西吐露真情——没有，一点也没有。我知道他把我当作一个有钱的愚蠢海员，随他去。我要保持我的重要性——因为还有可怜的艾薇在那里——我的女儿啊。我为什么要利用他困难的处境呢？我确实利用了——为了她。得了，我怎么能指望他怜悯呢？他要是知道真实情况的话，那他会利用我的。他会千方百计查清这个骗局，随后把钱硬扣住一年。艾薇的钱。而我却不给自己留一分钱。我那一年怎么过呢？ 一年啊！用不了一年，她的父亲早就没命啦。”","“I began to tamper with it in my pride.You begin to see a lot of things when you are going blind.I could not be frank with an old chum even.I was not frank with Massy—no, not altogether.I knew he took me for a wealthy sailor fool, and I let him.I wanted to keep up my importance—because there was poor Ivy away there—my daughter.What did I want to trade on his misery for?I did trade on it—for her.And now, what mercy could I expect from him?He would trade on mine if he knew it.He would hunt the old fraud out, and stick to the money for a year.Ivy’s money.And I haven’t kept a penny for myself.How am I going to live for a year.A year!In a year there will be no sun in the sky for her father.” "
"他发出深沉的声音，显得非常压抑，似乎他被塌方的土压在了下面，在向你谈萦绕在坟墓中那些死人心头的事一样。范怀克先生的脊背打了个冷颤。","His deep voice came out, awfully veiled, as though he had been overwhelmed by the earth of a landslide, and talking to you of the thoughts that haunt the dead in their graves.A cold shudder ran down Mr. Van Wyk’s back."
"“这种事情有多久了，从什么时候开始你的……”他开始说。","“And how long is it since you have...?” he began."
"“过了很久，我才相信这——这个上帝的惩罚，”惠利船长手遮着头，闷闷不乐而耐心地说。","“It was a long time before I could bring myself to believe in this—this visitation.” Captain Whalley spoke with gloomy patience from under his hand."
"他当时认为自己不该受到这样的惩罚。他开始一天又一天，一周又一周地自己欺骗自己。他身边有那个水手长——他的老部下。病情慢慢加重，到了他不再能欺骗自己的时候……","He had not thought he had deserved it.He had begun by deceiving himself from day to day, from week to week.He had the Serang at hand there—an old servant.It came on gradually, and when he could no longer deceive himself..."
"他的声音几乎低得没有了。 ","His voice died out almost."
"“我下定决心欺骗你们大伙，而不是抛下她不管。”","“Rather than give her up I set myself to deceive you all.” "
"“真叫人难以置信。”范怀克先生低声说。惠利船长那令人震惊的低声叙述源源不断地传来。","“It’s incredible,” whispered Mr. Van Wyk.Captain Whalley’s appalling murmur flowed on."
"“甚至上帝愤怒的信号也不能让我忘掉她。我一直感到自己精力充沛——我身体里热血沸腾，怎么能撇下自己的孩子不管呢？跟你一样热血沸腾。我觉得自己好像是瞎了眼的参孙，有力气拉倒置身其间的一座神殿。她是一个日子过得很艰难的女人，我可怜的妻子和我，我们过去经常一起为我们的孩子祈祷。你还记得吗，那一天我也跟你说过，我相信上帝会为了她让我活到一百岁？爱你的孩子有什么罪孽呢？你看得出来吗？我准备为了她永远活下去。我原来有点相信我办得到。从那以后我一直为死亡祈祷。哈！自以为了不起的人——你要活……”","“Not even the sign of God’s anger could make me forget her.How could I forsake my child, feeling my vigor all the time—the blood warm within me?Warm as yours.It seems to me that, like the blinded Samson, I would find the strength to shake down a temple upon my head.She’s a struggling woman—my own child that we used to pray over together, my poor wife and I.Do you remember that day I as well as told you that I believed God would let me live to a hundred for her sake?What sin is there in loving your child?Do you see it?I was ready for her sake to live for ever.I half believed I would.I’ve been praying for death since.Ha!Presumptuous man—you wanted to live...” "
"他喘着粗气哽咽了一下，使他那庞大的身躯猛地打了个哆嗦，震动得桌子上的玻璃杯都叮叮当当直响，好像整所房子，连屋脊梁都颤抖了。范怀克先生感觉到他那蛮横的爱已经转化为了一种同造化作斗争的方式；他知道得很清楚，对这个一辈子都在采取行动的人来说，不可能存在别的表现所有感情的方式；他还知道，如果他主动地不再为了他的孩子冒险，不干点事情，不忍受，那简直是把他对她热烈的爱从他跳动的心中抽出来。这事情太可怕、太不可思议了，甚至叫人无法想象。","A tremendous, shuddering upheaval of that big frame, shaken by a gasping sob, set the glasses jingling all over the table, seemed to make the whole house tremble to the roof-tree.And Mr. Van Wyk, whose feeling of outraged love had been translated into a form of struggle with nature, understood very well that, for that man whose whole life had been conditioned by action, there could exist no other expression for all the emotions; that, to voluntarily cease venturing, doing, enduring, for his child’s sake, would have been exactly like plucking his warm love for her out of his living heart.Something too monstrous, too impossible, even to conceive."
"惠利船长没有改变他的姿势，那看上去似乎在表示羞愧、悲伤和蔑视的心情。","Captain Whalley had not changed his attitude, that seemed to express something of shame, sorrow, and defiance."
"“我甚至还欺骗了你。要不是听到‘尊重’这个词，我还会骗下去呢。这样的词我不配。我本来还会对你隐瞒下去的。我不是对你隐瞒过吗？你不是委托那艘船在这次航行中运你的资产吗？”","“I have even deceived you.If it had not been for that word ‘esteem.’ These are not the words for me.I would have lied to you.Haven’t I lied to you?Weren’t you going to trust your property on board this very trip?” "
"“我每年有一份总保单。”范怀克先生几乎是不自觉地说，对忽然谈到商业上的事情感到吃惊。","“I have a floating yearly policy,” Mr. Van Wyk said almost unwittingly, and was amazed at the sudden cropping up of a commercial detail."
"“告诉你，那艘船确实不适合航海。要是真相传出去的话，那份保单就会无效……”","“The ship is unseaworthy, I tell you.The policy would be invalid if it were known...” "
"“那咱们就一起承担罪名。” ","“We shall share the guilt, then.” "
"“什么也减轻不了我的罪，”惠利船长说。","“Nothing could make mine less,” said Captain Whalley."
"他不敢去找医生看病。那个医生或许会问他是谁，是干什么的。马西可能听到一些风声。他活着得不到任何帮助，无论是神的还是人的。祈祷词哽在喉咙里。为了什么祈祷呢？ 而死亡好像还很遥远。他一踏进自己的舱房就不敢再走出去；他一坐下就不敢站起来；他不敢向任何人的脸抬起眼睛；他不愿望海面或者天空。在他那巨大的害怕面前（害怕这件事会暴露），这个世界在褪色。那艘旧船是他最后一个朋友；他不怕它；他熟悉它的每一英寸甲板。但是他也几乎不敢看向它，因为害怕发现他能看到的东西一天比一天更少。巨大的不安全感笼罩着他。水平线不见了；天空和海洋暗沉沉地混在一起。站在那边的人影是谁？躺在那里的是什么东西？他害怕地怀疑他看见的东西的真实性，这种怀疑甚至使他剩下的一点视力增加了他的苦恼，变成了永远张着口等着他这个倒霉蛋的陷阱。他害怕在什么事情上他结结巴巴地说出没法原谅的错话——对一个问题回答一声是或者不，而犯下不可挽回的大错。上帝的手已经抓住了他，但是无法把他从孩子那里拉开。他似乎生活在耻辱的梦魇中，每一个看不清容貌的人好像都是敌人。","He had not dared to consult a doctor; the man would have perhaps asked who he was, what he was doing; Massy might have heard something.He had lived on without any help, human or divine.The very prayers stuck in his throat.What was there to pray for? and death seemed as far as ever.Once he got into his cabin he dared not come out again; when he sat down he dared not get up; he dared not raise his eyes to anybody’s face; he felt reluctant to look upon the sea or up to the sky.The world was fading before his great fear of giving himself away.The old ship was his last friend; he was not afraid of her; he knew every inch of her deck; but at her too he hardly dared to look, for fear of finding he could see less than the day before.A great incertitude enveloped him.The horizon was gone; the sky mingled darkly with the sea.Who was this figure standing over yonder? what was this thing lying down there?And a frightful doubt of the reality of what he could see made even the remnant of sight that remained to him an added torment, a pitfall always open for his miserable pretense.He was afraid to stumble inexcusably over something—to say a fatal Yes or No to a question.The hand of God was upon him, but it could not tear him away from his child.And, as if in a nightmare of humiliation, every featureless man seemed an enemy."
"他把自己的那只手沉重地搁在桌子上。范怀克先生胳膊下垂，下巴贴着胸膛，雪白的牙齿咬着下嘴唇，微微闪光，他思索着斯特恩的那句话“那套把戏耍完了。”     ","He let his hand fall heavily on the table.Mr. Van Wyk, arms down, chin on breast, with a gleam of white teeth pressing on the lower lip, meditated on Sterne’s “The game’s up.” "
"“那个水手长肯定不知道。” ","“The Serang of course does not know.” "
"“没有人知道。”惠利船长自信地说。","“Nobody,” said Captain Whalley, with assurance."
"“啊，那就好。没有人知道。很好。你能维持到这次航行结束吗？这在跟马西签订的协定上是最后一次了。”","“Ah yes.Nobody.Very well.Can you keep it up to the end of the trip?That is the last under the agreement with Massy.” "
"惠利船长站起身来，站得笔直，仪表堂堂，雪白的大胡子仿佛白银胸铠罩在他心里可怕的秘密上。可不是；在他变得没有任何用处，成为一个负担，成为他自己的耻辱，悄悄地溜到什么地方去以前，这是他抱的唯一希望，他要再看到她，保住这笔钱，这是他能为她做的最后一件事了。他的声音颤抖了。","Captain Whalley got up and stood erect, very stately, with the great white beard lying like a silver breastplate over the awful secret of his heart.Yes; that was the only hope there was for him of ever seeing her again, of securing the money, the last he could do for her, before he crept away somewhere—useless, a burden, a reproach to himself.His voice faltered."
"“想想看！再也看不到她；除了我以外，世界上只有这个人还能记起我的妻子。她长得很像她妈妈。幸亏那个可怜的女人呆在另一个地方了，在那里他们不再为那些人流泪，他们生前是爱那些人的，而且现在依然在为那些人祈祷，免得他们受到诱惑——因为我想那些在天国享福的人，知道上帝在和他创造的孩子们打交道的时候仁慈的秘密。” ","“Think of it!Never see her any more: the only human being besides myself now on earth that can remember my wife.She’s just like her mother.Lucky the poor woman is where there are no tears shed over those they loved on earth and that remain to pray not to be led into temptation—because, I suppose, the blessed know the secret of grace in God’s dealings with His created children.” "
"他轻微地晃晃身子，严肃而庄重地说：","He swayed a little, said with austere dignity— "
"“我不知道那个秘密。我只知道上帝给我的孩子。”","“I don’t.I know only the child He has given me.” "
"他开始挪动脚步。范怀克先生跳起身来，完全明白那直挺挺的脑袋、犹豫不决的脚步、哆哆嗦嗦伸出去的那只手是怎么回事了。他的心跳得很快；他把椅子挪开，出于本能地走上前去，似乎要伸出胳膊去。但是惠利船长从他身旁经过，笔直地走向了台阶。","And he began to walk.Mr. Van Wyk, jumping up, saw the full meaning of the rigid head, the hesitating feet, the vaguely extended hand.His heart was beating fast; he moved a chair aside, and instinctively advanced as if to offer his arm.But Captain Whalley passed him by, making for the stairs quite straight."
"“我不在他的视线内，他根本看不到我。”范怀克想，有点害怕。然后他走到台阶口，微微颤栗地问：","“He could not see me at all out of his line,” Van Wyk thought, with a sort of awe.Then going to the head of the stairs, he asked a little tremulously— "
"“那是什么感觉——像雾——像……”","“What is it like—like a mist—like...” "
"惠利船长已经走了一半，站住脚，转过身去，毫不畏缩地回答说：","Captain Whalley, half-way down, stopped, and turned round undismayed to answer."
"“好像亮光从这个世界上逐渐退下去。你看到过一片平坦的沙滩上退潮吗？大海离你越来越远。就像这样——只是没有大片的潮水跟在后面。从来没有。似乎太阳越来越小，一颗颗星星不再闪烁光芒了。现在我能看到的不可能剩下很多了。但是我近来没有勇气看……”他一定能捉摸出范怀克先生的意图，因为他摆出了发号施令的架式挥挥手，还神情坚决地加上一句：","“It is as if the light were ebbing out of the world.Have you ever watched the ebbing sea on an open stretch of sands withdrawing farther and farther away from you?It is like this—only there will be no flood to follow.Never.It is as if the sun were growing smaller, the stars going out one by one.There can’t be many left that I can see by this.But I haven’t had the courage to look of late...” He must have been able to make out Mr. Van Wyk, because he checked him by an authoritative gesture and a stoical— "
"“我自己还能走。”","“I can get about alone yet.” "
"他似乎对自己的现状很满意，像一个被从天上撵下来的傲慢的神，不愿接受别人的帮助。范怀克先生停住了，好像在数那些完全听不到了的脚步声。他在一张张桌子中间走动，矫健地用脚跟踩出声音，拿起一把裁纸刀，心不在焉地向刀锋瞟上一眼，再把刀放下。然后他碰巧走到钢琴前，用力地把几个和音弹了又弹，站起身来，呆在键盘前，显出一副专心致志的模样，像一个调音的人。关上钢琴，他突然挪动脚跟，猛地转过身来，避开那条前爪交叉、信任地睡熟了的小狗，来到旁边的台阶前，在最高的一磴上像失去了平衡似的一直冲出了房子。他的仆人们开始收拾餐桌，听到他在下面低声地自言自语（无疑尽是脏话），停顿了一下，迈着散步一样的步子走向了码头。","It was as if he had taken his line, and would accept no help from men, after having been cast out, like a presumptuous Titan, from his heaven.Mr. Van Wyk, arrested, seemed to count the footsteps right out of earshot.He walked between the tables, tapping smartly with his heels, took up a paper-knife, dropped it after a vague glance along the blade; then happening upon the piano, struck a few chords again and again, vigorously, standing up before the keyboard with an attentive poise of the head like a piano-tuner; closing it, he pivoted on his heels brusquely, avoided the little terrier sleeping trustfully on crossed forepaws, came upon the stairs next, and, as though he had lost his balance on the top step, ran down headlong out of the house.His servants, beginning to clear the table, heard him mutter to himself (evil words no doubt) down there, and then after a pause go away with a strolling gait in the direction of the wharf."
"苏法拉号的舷樯靠在高低不平的河岸旁边，像一堵低低的、黑魆魆的墙一样。两根桅杆和一根烟囱从墙后升起，倾斜得非常厉害，好像要倒下来似的。中央是一个结实、方正、高大的建筑物，上面显出一些影影绰绰的白色小船的形状，吊艇架的曲线、栏杆和支柱的线条，只见到所有地方的一切都黑魆魆、乱糟糟地混在一起。可是在下面低处，船的纵中线上，只有一个舷窗里射出灯光，照进了黑夜。灯光是浑圆的，像一轮小小的满月，黄色的亮光映出一片潮湿的烂泥地和踩过的草地边缘，以及两圈盘在一根竖立在地上的粗木柱周围的沉重的缆绳。","The bulwarks of the Sofala lying alongside the bank made a low, black wall on the undulating contour of the shore.Two masts and a funnel uprose from behind it with a great rake, as if about to fall: a solid, square elevation in the middle bore the ghostly shapes of white boats, the curves of davits, lines of rail and stanchions, all confused and mingling darkly everywhere; but low down, amidships, a single lighted port stared out on the night, perfectly round, like a small, full moon, whose yellow beam caught a patch of wet mud, the edge of trodden grass, two turns of heavy cable wound round the foot of a thick wooden post in the ground."
"范怀克先生盯着船舷看，听到一个醉得稀里糊涂、自吹自擂的声音，显然在嘲笑一个叫普伦德加斯特的人。那个声音含含糊糊地乱骂一阵后，哽住了，后来很清楚地说出“墨菲”那个姓，轻轻地笑起来。玻璃杯发出颤抖的叮当声。这一切声音都是从那个有灯光的舷窗里传来的。范怀克先生犹豫了，弯腰曲背地站着。如果你不走到下面的烂泥地上去，你就不可能看仔细。","Mr. Van Wyk, peering alongside, heard a muzzy boastful voice apparently jeering at a person called Prendergast.It mouthed abuse thickly, choked; then pronounced very distinctly the word “Murphy,” and chuckled.Glass tinkled tremulously.All these sounds came from the lighted port.Mr. Van Wyk hesitated, stooped; it was impossible to look through unless he went down into the mud."
" “斯特恩，”他几乎大声地说。 ","“Sterne,” he said, half aloud."
"那个醉醺醺的声音在舱房内高兴地说：","The drunken voice within said gladly— "
"“斯特恩——当然啦。瞧他眨巴着眼睛。瞧他！斯特恩、惠利、马西。马西、惠利、斯特恩。然而，马西是最了不起的。你没法和他耍手段。他会很高兴地看你挨饿的。” ","“Sterne—of course.Look at him blink.Look at him!Sterne, Whalley, Massy.Massy, Whalley, Sterne.But Massy’s the best.You can’t come over him.He would just love to see you starve.” "
"范怀克先生走开去，继续向前，发觉天篷底下有一颗黑黝黝的脑袋探了出来，似乎在值班，就轻轻地用马来话说：“大副睡着了吗？”","Mr. Van Wyk moved away, made out farther forward a shadowy head stuck out from under the awnings as if on the watch, and spoke quietly in Malay, “Is the mate asleep?” "
"“没有。在这里，听候吩咐。”","“No.Here, at your service.” "
"一眨眼，斯特恩出现了，从码头上走过来，像一只猫那样无声无息。","In a moment Sterne appeared, walking as noiselessly as a cat on the wharf."
"“天这么黑，我想不到你今夜会下来。” ","“It’s so jolly dark, and I had no idea you would be down to-night.” "
"“那可怕的谩骂声是怎么回事？”范怀克先生问，似乎在说明他出声打了个冷颤的原因。","“What’s this horrible raving?” asked Mr. Van Wyk, as if to explain the cause of a shudder than ran over him audibly."
"“杰克喝醉了酒正乱叫乱嚷。那是我们的二管轮。这是他的老毛病。到明天下午就会好的，然而马西先生会在甲板上走来走去，吵得人心烦。咱们还是走的好。”","“Jack’s broken out on a drunk.That’s our second.It’s his way.He will be right enough by to-morrow afternoon, only Mr. Massy will keep on worrying up and down the deck.We had better get away.” "
"他低声暗示“到山上的房子里去”谈话。他早就盼望去那里了，可是范怀克先生冷淡地反对。他怕这样也许不太谨慎。几颗闪烁的大星星在连绵不断、平静地流着的河面上，到处投下一丝丝微弱的亮光，仿佛亮光是织在河水中似的。在那条开阔的河旁旅客上下的地方附近，有两棵大树，其中一棵树底下的漆黑的树影把他们吞没了。","He muttered suggestively of a talk “up at the house.” He had long desired to effect an entrance there, but Mr. Van Wyk nonchalantly demurred: it would not, he feared, be quite prudent, perhaps; and the opaque black shadow under one of the two big trees left at the landing-place swallowed them up, impenetrably dense, by the side of the wide river, that seemed to spin into threads of glitter the light of a few big stars dropped here and there upon its outspread and flowing stillness."
"“毫无疑问情况是严重的。”范怀克先生说。他们都穿着白衣服，像幽灵似的，看不出对方的面貌；他们的脚踩在柔软的泥地上，毫无声音。只听到一阵轻轻的说话声。斯特恩先生对这样的开头感到满意。","“The situation is grave beyond doubt,” Mr. Van Wyk said.Ghost-like in their white clothes they could not distinguish each others’ features, and their feet made no sound on the soft earth.A sort of purring was heard.Mr. Sterne felt gratified by such a beginning."
"“我想，范怀克先生，你这样有身份的人会马上就看出我的处境是多么的尴尬。”","“I thought, Mr. Van Wyk, a gentleman of your sort would see at once how awkwardly I was situated.” "
"“可不是，很尴尬。他的健康状况显然很糟。也许他快要垮掉了。我知道，而且他自己也知道得很清楚——我假设我是在跟一个通情达理的人说话——他知道得很清楚，他的腿快动不了啦。”","“Yes, very.Obviously his health is bad.Perhaps he’s breaking up.I see, and he himself is well aware—I assume I am speaking to a man of sense—he is well aware that his legs are giving out.” "
"“他的腿——啊！”斯特恩先生不知道该怎么说才好，生气了。“你要是喜欢的话，说他有腿病也行。我想知道的是，他是不是打算悄悄地走掉。说得倒也好听！他的腿！呸!”","“His legs—ah!” Mr. Sterne was disconcerted, and then turned sulky.“You may call it his legs if you like; what I want to know is whether he intends to clear out quietly.That’s a good one, too!His legs!Pooh!” "
"“嗯，可不是。只要看看他走路的模样。”范怀克先生用极为冷静和毫不怀疑的口气打断他的话。“然而，问题是你的责任感太过分了，你会不会反而得不到你应该得到的利益。毕竟我能为你出点力。你知道我这个人。” ","“Why, yes.Only look at the way he walks.” Mr. Van Wyk took him up in a perfectly cool and undoubting tone.“The question, however, is whether your sense of duty does not carry you too far from your true interest.After all, I too could do something to serve you.You know who I am.” "
"“海峡这一带人人都听说过你的大名，先生。” ","“Everybody along the Straits has heard of you, sir.” "
"范怀克先生认为这话有点吹捧的味道。斯特恩听到这句开玩笑的话轻轻地笑了。他竟然也这么想啦！合伙协定就在这次航行结束以后取消，他热烈赞同这个开场白。他是知道的。在这倒霉的整整一天中，人在船上没有听到过别的事情。马西，因为两个有毛病的旧锅炉，陷进了确实很深的困境，这根本不是什么秘密。他首先需要到什么地方去借几百镑付清欠船长的钱；然后他必须把那艘船抵押出去，弄一笔钱去买新锅炉——也就是说，他要能找到肯借钱的人才行。不管事情多么顺利也没用，也得损失时间，贸易中断一段时间，全年的收入就要减少——而且跟他往来的那些客户被德国人抢走的危险始终存在。有人悄悄地传说，他已经试过两家公司。没有一家愿意跟他打交道。船太陈旧了，而且这个人在这一带的名声又太臭……斯特恩先生咬牙切齿地压低声音说，一边很快地眨巴着眼睛，可是他那副眨眼的模样始终隐藏在漆黑中。","Mr. Van Wyk presumed that this meant something favorable.Sterne had a soft laugh at this pleasantry.He should think so!To the opening statement, that the partnership agreement was to expire at the end of this very trip, he gave an attentive assent.He was aware.One heard of nothing else on board all the blessed day long.As to Massy, it was no secret that he was in a jolly deep hole with these worn-out boilers.He would have to borrow somewhere a couple of hundred first of all to pay off the captain; and then he would have to raise money on mortgage upon the ship for the new boilers—that is, if he could find a lender at all.At best it meant loss of time, a break in the trade, short earnings for the year—and there was always the danger of having his connection filched away from him by the Germans.It was whispered about that he had already tried two firms.Neither would have anything to do with him.Ship too old, and the man too well known in the place....Mr. Sterne’s final rapid winking remained buried in the deep darkness sibilating with his whispers."
"“那么，假如说他借到了钱，”范怀克先生继续用他从容不迫的声调轻轻地说，“依你看，他完全有可能收下接受抵押的人硬塞给他的一个人当船长。拿我来说，我要是提供那笔钱的话，我知道自己也会那么规定的。实际上，我正在考虑提供给他。这对我有许多好处。你明白这对正在讨论的这件事情会有什么影响吗？”","“Supposing, then, he got the loan,” Mr. Van Wyk resumed in a deliberate undertone, “on your own showing he’s more than likely to get a mortgagee’s man thrust upon him as captain.For my part, I know that I would make that very stipulation myself if I had to find the money.And as a matter of fact I am thinking of doing so.It would be worth my while in many ways.Do you see how this would bear on the case under discussion?” "
"“谢谢你，先生。我肯定你找不到一个更关心你利益的人。”","“Thank you, sir.I am sure you couldn’t get anybody that would care more for your interests.” "
"“嗯，惠利船长干到期满符合我的利益。我也许会跟你一起坐船到海峡下游去。如果这能够做到的话，到了这一切发生变化的时候，我会到场的，而且能够照顾你的利益。”","“Well, it suits my interest that Captain Whalley should finish his time.I shall probably take a passage with you down the Straits.If that can be done, I’ll be on the spot when all these changes take place, and in a position to look after @your@ interests.” "
"“范怀克先生，这对我真是再好不过了。我肯定我无比地……”","“Mr. Van Wyk, I want nothing better.I am sure I am infinitely...” "
"“那么，我想这可以毫不麻烦地办到喽。”","“I take it, then, that this may be done without any trouble.” "
"“唉，先生，担风险是避免不了的，可是现在我把你当我的雇主那样对你说，事情比看起来的要安全。要是哪个人告诉我这件事的话，那我不会相信的，可是我自己一直在观察。那个老水手就是被训练来干这套把戏的。他的——他的——胳膊和大腿一点没毛病，先生。他已经习惯独自操作，而且干得很出色。我可以肯定地说，先生，惠利船长，那个可怜的人，决不是没有用的人。这是事实。我来跟你说明白，先生。他把那个老猴子似的马来人教得本领很过硬，他很懂得该做什么。嘿，过去的二十五年里，他一定在各种各样的英国船上断断续续地干应该是船长干的工作。那些土人，先生，只要他们有白人在背后撑腰,会一直干得很好的，好得叫人大为惊奇——哪怕是放手让他们自己干也是这样。只是一定要有白人摆摆样子，给他们打气，使他们硬起来；船长就是派这种用处的人。嘿，先生，他把那个人训练得真好，如今他几乎不用开口了。我看到那个像猴子似的满脸皱纹的矮子在一个刮风的早晨，而且是在所有那些岛中间把船开过，开出了潘古湾；他开得很出色，先生，躲在那个老人的胳膊肘底下，而且态度是那么从容，你无论如何也搞不清上边那两个人当中是谁在干活。这就是咱们那可怜的朋友，哪怕——哪怕——他连一只脚也抬不起来了，却在船上仍然有用的奥妙，先生。只要那个水手长不知道这种情况，事情就没有一点不对头。”","“Well, sir, what risk there is can’t be helped; but (speaking to you as my employer now) the thing is more safe than it looks.If anybody had told me of it I wouldn’t have believed it, but I have been looking on myself.That old Serang has been trained up to the game.There’s nothing the matter with his—his—limbs, sir.He’s got used to doing things himself in a remarkable way.And let me tell you, sir, that Captain Whalley, poor man, is by no means useless.Fact.Let me explain to you, sir.He stiffens up that old monkey of a Malay, who knows well enough what to do.Why, he must have kept captain’s watches in all sorts of country ships off and on for the last five-and-twenty years.These natives, sir, as long as they have a white man close at the back, will go on doing the right thing most surprisingly well—even if left quite to themselves.Only the white man must be of the sort to put starch into them, and the captain is just the one for that.Why, sir, he has drilled him so well that now he needs hardly speak at all.I have seen that little wrinkled ape made to take the ship out of Pangu Bay on a blowy morning and on all through the islands; take her out first-rate, sir, dodging under the old man’s elbow, and in such quiet style that you could not have told for the life of you which of the two was doing the work up there.That’s where our poor friend would be still of use to the ship even if—if—he could no longer lift a foot, sir.Provided the Serang does not know that there’s anything wrong.” "
"“他不知道。”","“He doesn’t.” "
"“自然不知道喽。这种事情大大超出了他的理解范围。他们搞不清咱们的任何事情，先生。”","“Naturally not.Quite beyond his apprehension.They aren’t capable of finding out anything about us, sir.” "
"“你似乎是个精明人。”范怀克先生用抑制了的低声说，似乎觉得恶心一样。","“You seem to be a shrewd man,” said Mr. Van Wyk in a choked mutter, as though he were feeling sick."
"“你会发现我是一个很能干的仆人，先生。”","“You’ll find me a good enough servant, sir.” "
"斯特恩先生现在指望至少得握握手，但是想不到随着范怀克先生的“这是什么？还是别让人看到我们在一起”这句话，他白晃晃的人影一闪，似乎顿时消失在密密匝匝的树枝底下的黑暗里了。那个大副大吃一惊。可不是。传来一阵轻微的砰砰捶击声。","Mr. Sterne hoped now for a handshake at least, but unexpectedly, with a “What’s this?Better not to be seen together,” Mr. Van Wyk’s white shape wavered, and instantly seemed to melt away in the black air under the roof of boughs.The mate was startled.Yes.There was that faint thumping clatter."
"他毫无声息地从树荫下偷偷溜出来。远处点着灯的舷窗里透出亮光。他被突然的成功陶醉得头晕了。能跟一个有身份的人打交道，多妙啊！他蹑手蹑脚地走上船去；在一片黑影幢幢、空荡荡的甲板上有一个奇怪的人影，在对船中部更黑暗处发出来的叫声和捶击声作出反应。马西先生在舱房前大发雷霆, 但是在砰砰作响的踢门声中，舱房里的那个醉醺醺的声音却不受干扰地说个不停。","He stole out silently from under the shade.The lighted port-hole shone from afar.His head swam with the intoxication of sudden success.What a thing it was to have a gentleman to deal with!He crept aboard, and there was something weird in the shadowy stretch of empty decks, echoing with shouts and blows proceeding from a darker part amidships.Mr. Massy was raging before the door of the berth: the drunken voice within flowed on undisturbed in the violent racket of kicks."
"“闭嘴！熄掉灯，上床睡觉去，你这头讨厌的醉猪——你！你听到我的话了吗，你这畜生？”","“Shut up!Put your light out and turn in, you confounded swilling pig—you!D’you hear me, you beast?” "
"踢门的声音停止了；静了一下以后，里边传来了醉得含糊不清的、神谕似的话：","The kicking stopped, and in the pause the muzzy oracular voice announced from within— "
"“啊！马西那是另一回事了。马西叫人莫测高深。” ","“Ah!Massy, now—that’s another thing.Massy’s deep.” "
"“谁在船尾那里？是你吗，斯特恩？他会发酒疯发得吓坏人。”那个轮机长从轮机室角落里出现，显得模糊而巨大。","“Who’s that aft there?You, Sterne?He’ll drink himself into a fit of horrors.” The chief engineer appeared vague and big at the corner of the engineroom."
"“他明天会很好地干活的。我宁愿让他去，马西先生。”","“He will be good enough for duty to-morrow.I would let him be, Mr. Massy.” "
" 斯特恩一溜进自己的舱房，不得不马上坐下。他高兴得头晕了。他上床去睡的时候，好像在做梦一样。他感到宁静极了，感到宁静的喜悦。甲板上寂静一片。","Sterne slipped away into his berth, and at once had to sit down.His head swam with exultation.He got into his bunk as if in a dream.A feeling of profound peace, of pacific joy, came over him.On deck all was quiet."
"马西先生把耳朵贴在杰克的舱房门上，不满意地倾听着里面深沉的打呼噜声。这是醉得不省人事的沉睡。酒疯算是发过了。平静以后，他也回到自己的舱房，慢慢地扭动着身子脱掉他那件旧的粗花呢短上衣。这是一件有许多口袋的衣服，他在白天天气偶尔突然变冷的时候，总是穿上这件衣服；等到他一感到暖和，就会把它脱掉，随手挂在船上的随便什么地方。人们会看到那件衣服搭在系绳桩上，撂在曲抦头上，甚至挂在人们的门把上。他不是船主吗？可是他喜爱的地方是驾驶台上一个系天篷的木柱，在罗经柜附近。他开始的时候为了这件事甚至不止一次地跟惠利船长争吵。船长希望驾驶台保持整洁。当时他被吓倒了。然而，近来他可以太平无事地不买他合伙人的帐了。惠利船长如今似乎什么也不注意了。至于那些马来人，他们都怕那个老是沉着脸的人；不管他那件衣服挂在哪里或什么东西上，没有一个水手会想到用手碰它的。","Mr. Massy, with his ear against the door of Jack’s cabin, listened critically to a deep stertorous breathing within.This was a dead-drunk sleep.The bout was over: tranquilized on that score, he too went in, and with slow wriggles got out of his old tweed jacket.It was a garment with many pockets, which he used to put on at odd times of the day, being subject to sudden chilly fits, and when he felt warmed he would take it off and hang it about anywhere all over the ship.It would be seen swinging on belaying-pins, thrown over the heads of winches, suspended on people’s very door-handles for that matter.Was he not the owner?But his favorite place was a hook on a wooden awning stanchion on the bridge, almost against the binnacle.He had even in the early days more than one tussle on that point with Captain Whalley, who desired the bridge to be kept tidy.He had been overawed then.Of late, though, he had been able to defy his partner with impunity.Captain Whalley never seemed to notice anything now.As to the Malays, in their awe of that scowling man not one of the crew would dream of laying a hand on the thing, no matter where or what it swung from."
"不料，出了这样一件事情，把马西先生吓得直跳起来，使他的衣服掉在脚旁。原来隔壁舱房里传来砰的一撞和一阵叮叮当当掉在地上的响声。忠诚的杰克刚才一定在坐着大喝的时候，突然睡着了，这会儿连人带椅摔倒在地上，听声音似乎把那里的酒杯和酒瓶都砸碎了。那一阵可怕的响声传出来以后，那里安静了片刻，好像他已经当场摔死似的。马西先生屏住气。最后。一阵充满睡意、不自在的哼哼唧唧的叹气声从舱壁的另一边传了过来。","With an unexpectedness which made Mr. Massy jump and drop the coat at his feet, there came from the next berth the crash and thud of a headlong, jingling, clattering fall.The faithful Jack must have dropped to sleep suddenly as he sat at his revels, and now had gone over chair and all, breaking, as it seemed by the sound, every single glass and bottle in the place.After the terrific smash all was still for a time in there, as though he had killed himself outright on the spot.Mr. Massy held his breath.At last a sleepy uneasy groaning sigh was exhaled slowly on the other side of the bulkhead."
"“我巴不得他这会儿醉得别醒过来。”马西先生咕哝着说。","“I hope to goodness he’s too drunk to wake up now,” muttered Mr. Massy."
"一阵轻轻的、狡猾的笑声几乎使他陷入了绝望的境地。他低声恶毒地咒骂。这个蠢货一定会吵得他整宿睡不成觉了。他诅咒自己的运气。有时候，他想在睡眠中忘掉那些逼得他快要发疯的麻烦。他听不出有什么动作。杰克好像压根没有爬起身来的打算，他躺在原地，继续对着自己吃吃地笑。然后他开口说话，好像接着他刚才的话说下去似的：","The sound of a softly knowing laugh nearly drove him to despair.He swore violently under his breath.The fool would keep him awake all night now for certain.He cursed his luck.He wanted to forget his maddening troubles in sleep sometimes.He could detect no movements.Without apparently making the slightest attempt to get up, Jack went on sniggering to himself where he lay; then began to speak, where he had left off as it were— "
"“马西！我喜欢这个卑鄙的流氓。他会髙兴地看他可怜的老杰克饿肚子的——可是你瞧他爬得多高。”……他傲慢而从容地打着嗝……“当上了船主，一点不比任何人差。你要一张彩票。哈！哈！我会给你彩票的，老弟。让那艘老船沉掉，让那个老朋友饿肚子——那倒是个办法。他错不了——马西错不了。他才不会错。他是个天才——那人是个天才。那是个赢钱的办法。船跟朋友都一定要甩掉。”","“Massy!I love the dirty rascal.He would like to see his poor old Jack starve—but just you look where he has climbed to.”...He hiccoughed in a superior, leisurely manner....“Ship-owning it with the best.A lottery ticket you want.Ha! ha!I will give you lottery tickets, my boy.Let the old ship sink and the old chum starve—that’s right.He don’t go wrong—Massy don’t.Not he.He’s a genius—that man is.That’s the way to win your money.Ship and chum must go.” "
"“这个傻里傻气的蠢货已经在为这件事担心了。”马西对自己咕哝着。他脸上的表情变得温和了，仔细听着有没有又出现丝毫瞌睡的痕迹，没想到传来的是一阵欢乐而嘲弄的大笑，他沮丧极了。","“The silly fool has taken it to heart,” muttered Massy to himself.And, listening with a softened expression of face for any slight sign of returning drowsiness, he was discouraged profoundly by a burst of laughter full of joyful irony."
"“但愿看到这艘船沉在海底！啊,你这聪明的，聪明的家伙!希望它沉掉，嗯？老弟，我想你会这么希望的。沉掉那艘该死的老船，还有它给你带来的一切烦恼。捞一笔保险费——抛弃你的老朋友——一切都好了——又是个有身份的人了。”","“Would like to see her at the bottom of the sea!Oh, you clever, clever devil!Wish her sunk, eh?I should think you would, my boy; the damned old thing and all your troubles with her.Rake in the insurance money —turn your back on your old chum—all’s well—gentleman again.” "
"马西的脸神情凶狠，纹丝不动。只有他那双黑色的大眼睛在不安地骨碌碌转动。这个胡言乱语的蠢货。可是句句都是实话。可不是。也是彩票嘛。句句都是实话。什么？再从头干起？他可不这么希望……","A grim stillness had come over Massy’s face.Only his big black eyes rolled uneasily.The raving fool.And yet it was all true.Yes.Lottery tickets, too.All true.What?Beginning again?He wished he wouldn’t...."
"可是情况的确是这样。那个富于想象力的醉汉，在舱壁的另一边说了最后那些话以后，死样的寂静笼罩着停泊在毫无声息的岸边这艘黑沉沉的船，但是他撵走了寂静。","But it was even so.The imaginative drunkard on the other side of the bulkhead shook off the deathlike stillness that after his last words had fallen on the dark ship moored to a silent shore."
"“谅你不敢说什么反对乔治·马西先生的话，先生。他等得厌烦的时候，会把那艘船沉掉的。小心！它沉下去了——还有朋友和其他一切。他会知道怎样……”","“Don’t you dare to say anything against George Massy, Esquire.When he’s tired of waiting he will do away with her.Look out!Down she goes—chum and all.He’ll know how to...” "
"那个声音犹豫了,倦怠、恍惚、迷惘，好像渐渐消失在巨大的空间中一样。","The voice hesitated, weary, dreamy, lost, as if dying away in a vast open space."
"“……找到一个可行的花招。他是干得成的——决不要害怕……”","“...Find a trick that will work.He’s up to it—never fear...” "
"他一定喝得酩酊大醉了，因为最后沉甸甸的睡眠像有魔法似的突然控制住了他，他的最后一个字拖长着，变成不间断的、吵闹而往里吸的打呼噜声。后来，甚至打呼噜声也停止了，一片寂静。","He must have been very drunk, for at last the heavy sleep gripped him with the suddenness of a magic spell, and the last word lengthened itself into an interminable, noisy, in-drawn snore.And then even the snoring stopped, and all was still."
"可是马西先生似乎突然变得怀疑起睡眠对消除人的烦恼的功效；要不，他也许已经在寂静中通过心平气和的沉思找到了他所需要的安慰,在沉思中可能出现种种活灵活现的想法，什么发财、交好运、长期过悠闲的生活，还可能把你盼望的所有东西呈现在你的眼前，因为他转过身去,把两条胳膊伸到床边上，站在那里，脚踩在他喜欢的那件旧上衣上，从圆舷窗里望出去，望着那河面上的黑夜。有时候，一阵微风吹进来，吹到他的脸上。这是从宽阔的河面上吹来的带有潮湿、清新气息的凉风。他只能看到河面上到处微弱的闪光。他有一次可能认为自己还是打了个盹，因为在他眼前意料不到地出现了一个幻景， 肯定不是做梦，那是一排火光熊熊的巨大的数字——三零七一二——组成一个你在彩票上可能看到的号码。然后，舷窗外一下子不再是漆黑，而是珍珠灰色的了，呈现出一片盖满房子的河岸，草屋顶接着草屋顶，席子和竹子的墙，雕花的柚木三角墙。那条河像一条钢带，河水漫到河边，没有一丝波浪，拐弯的地方在涨潮，河的两岸边密密麻麻地立着木桩，木桩上建着一排排住房。这就是巴都贝鲁——天亮了。","But it seemed as though Mr. Massy had suddenly come to doubt the efficacy of sleep as against a man’s troubles; or perhaps he had found the relief he needed in the stillness of a calm contemplation that may contain the vivid thoughts of wealth, of a stroke of luck, of long idleness, and may bring before you the imagined form of every desire; for, turning about and throwing his arms over the edge of his bunk, he stood there with his feet on his favorite old coat, looking out through the round port into the night over the river.Sometimes a breath of wind would enter and touch his face, a cool breath charged with the damp, fresh feel from a vast body of water.A glimmer here and there was all he could see of it; and once he might after all suppose he had dozed off, since there appeared before his vision, unexpectedly and connected with no dream, a row of flaming and gigantic figures—three naught seven one two—making up a number such as you may see on a lottery ticket.And then all at once the port was no longer black: it was pearly gray, framing a shore crowded with houses, thatched roof beyond thatched roof, walls of mats and bamboo, gables of carved teak timber.Rows of dwellings raised on a forest of piles lined the steely band of the river, brimful and still, with the tide at the turn.This was Batu Beru—and the day had come."
"马西先生摇摇身子，穿上那件粗花呢上衣。他似乎受到了巨大的震惊一样，神经质地直打哆嗦，记下了那个数目。那是难得的幸福的暗示。可不是。然而，人需要钱去追求幸福——现钱。","Mr. Massy shook himself, put on the tweed coat, and, shivering nervously as if from some great shock, made a note of the number.A fortunate, rare hint that.Yes; but to pursue fortune one wanted money—ready cash."
" 接着他走出去，准备走到下边的轮机室去。还有几件小事得料理一下。杰克喝得酩酊大醉，躺在地板上，像个死人，房门还锁着。一想到干活，他的气又上来了。唉!可是你想要什么都不干就得先有一大笔钱。一艘船还没法给你办到。他诅咒苏法拉号。的确是实话，句句都是实话。那艘船已经成为他生活中的一个灾难，他等一个终于摆脱它的机会，已经等得不耐烦了。","Then he went out and prepared to descend into the engine-room.Several small jobs had to be seen to, and Jack was lying dead drunk on the floor of his cabin, with the door locked at that.His gorge rose at the thought of work.Ay! But if you wanted to do nothing you had to get first a good bit of money.A ship won’t save you.He cursed the Sofala.True, all true.He was tired of waiting for some chance that would rid him at last of that ship that had turned out a curse on his life."
"第十四章","XIV "
"庄重、震颤的汽笛声深沉而没完没了地响着，让人有点受不了。范怀克先生的脊背上微微打了个寒颤。中午刚过，苏法拉号正离开巴都贝鲁，向下一个停靠地点潘古开去。那艘船在河中摇摇晃晃地前进，由为数不多的几条独木舟陪同着，从宽阔的河面上悄悄地驶过去，直到从范怀克的房子那里看不到了。","The deep, interminable hoot of the steam-whistle had, in its grave, vibrating note, something intolerable, which sent a slight shudder down Mr. Van Wyk’s back.It was the early afternoon; the Sofala was leaving Batu Beru for Pangu, the next place of call.She swung in the stream, scantily attended by a few canoes, and, gliding on the broad river, became lost to view from the Van Wyk bungalow."
"平房的主人这次没有去给船送行。他通常会来到小山下的码头上，在船解缆的时候和驾驶台上的人交谈几句，在最后时刻向惠利船长招招手。这一天，他甚至没有走到阳台的栏杆旁。“即使我去，他也看不到我。”他对自己说，“我拿不准他是否能看见这所房子。”这个念头，不知为何，使他感觉到这些年来他从未感到过的孤独。多久了？六年还是七年？七年。好长的时间啊。","Its owner had not gone this time to see her off.Generally he came down to the wharf, exchanged a few words with the bridge while she cast off, and waved his hand to Captain Whalley at the last moment.This day he did not even go as far as the balustrade of the veranda.“He couldn’t see me if I did,” he said to himself.“I wonder whether he can make out the house at all.” And this thought somehow made him feel more alone than he had ever felt for all these years.What was it? six or seven?Seven.A long time."
"他坐在阳台上，膝盖上放着一本没有翻开的书，可以说在观察自己的孤单，似乎惠利船长双目失明这个事实，让他对自已睁开了双眼。有许许多多、各种各样伤心和烦恼的事情，而且无论人待在什么地方，终究会遇到伤心和烦恼的事情。他感到害臊，似乎他六年来的所作所为就像一个撒娇的孩子。","He sat on the veranda with a closed book on his knee, and, as it were, looked out upon his solitude, as if the fact of Captain Whalley’s blindness had opened his eyes to his own.There were many sorts of heartaches and troubles, and there was no place where they could not find a man out.And he felt ashamed, as though he had for six years behaved like a peevish boy."
"他的念头追随着正在行驶的苏法拉号。他一时冲动，已经不假思索地采取行动，插手处理这件最紧急的事情了。他还有什么别的事情可以干呢？以后他会知道的。看来他还需要跟世事打打交道，至少再打一段时间。他有钱——这是能够操控的东西；他不会吝惜时间，也不怕麻烦和孤独。现在事情压在他的身上了——惠利船长出现在他面前，坐着，手遮着眼睛，似乎他受了自己相信的信仰的欺骗，对人们所能做的一切善恶都无动于衷了。","His thought followed the Sofala on her way.On the spur of the moment he had acted impulsively, turning to the thing most pressing.And what else could he have done?Later on he should see.It seemed necessary that he should come out into the world, for a time at least.He had money—something could be arranged; he would grudge no time, no trouble, no loss of his solitude.It weighed on him now—and Captain Whalley appeared to him as he had sat shading his eyes, as if, being deceived in the trust of his faith, he were beyond all the good and evil that can be wrought by the hands of men."
"范怀克先生的念头追随着向下游驶去的苏法拉号，弯弯曲曲地在两岸的树林地带中间穿过，在支柱似的大树中间穿过，在狭长的红树林地带穿过，开过了沙洲。在大白天，那艘船恰好由斯特恩先生驾驶，顺利地通过了沙洲。他是四点到六点那一班；后来他从驾驶台上走下去，满心欢喜，由于他想到他真的要被一个像范怀克先生那样的有钱人雇用了。他看不出现在怎么可能出现障碍。他似乎消除不了“终于安排好了”的感觉。六点到八点，那个水手长当班，独自照料着那艘船。从现在到早晨三点钟光景，前面的航道清清楚楚。到那时候，船就要靠近潘古湾中的那些小岛。到八点钟，斯特恩先生再兴髙采烈地出来照管，直到半夜。十点钟，他仍然在驾驶台上叽叽咕咕地哼着小调，大约在这个时候，范怀克先生的念头撇下了苏法拉号。范怀克先生终于睡着了。","Mr. Van Wyk’s thoughts followed the Sofala down the river, winding about through the belt of the coast forest, between the buttressed shafts of the big trees, through the mangrove strip, and over the bar.The ship crossed it easily in broad daylight, piloted, as it happened, by Mr. Sterne, who took the watch from four to six, and then went below to hug himself with delight at the prospect of being virtually employed by a rich man—like Mr. Van Wyk.He could not see how any hitch could occur now.He did not seem able to get over the feeling of being “fixed up at last.” From six to eight, in the course of duty, the Serang looked alone after the ship.She had a clear road before her now till about three in the morning, when she would close with the Pangu group.At eight Mr. Sterne came out cheerily to take charge again till midnight.At ten he was still chirruping and humming to himself on the bridge, and about that time Mr. Van Wyk’s thought abandoned the Sofala.Mr. Van Wyk had fallen asleep at last."
"马西沉着脸，拦住了他轮机室里的同事的路；猛地穿上他那件粗花呢短上衣，那个二管轮愁眉苦脸地等着。","Massy, blocking the engine-room companion, jerked himself into his tweed jacket surlily, while the second waited with a scowl."
"“啊。你出来了？你这个酒鬼！嘿，你有什么话要为自己说呢？”","“Oh.You came out?You sot!Well, what have you got to say for yourself?” "
"他一直照管着机器，直到现在。他憋着一肚子火，简直给气糊涂了，冲着那艘船，冲着艰难的生活，冲着那些欺骗他的人，还冲着他自己，大发脾气——因为他内心激动。","He had been in charge of the engines till then.A somber fury darkened his mind: a hot anger against the ship, against the facts of life, against the men for their cheating, against himself too—because of an inward tremor of his heart."
"回答他的是一阵听不懂的嘟嘟囔囔的声音。 ","An incomprehensible growl answered him."
"“什么？你现在不能张嘴吗？你喝醉以后，嚷嚷咧咧，尽说些该死的废话。你那样胡乱骂人，是什么意思?——你这个不中用的老醉鬼，你!”","“What?Can’t you open your mouth now?You yelp out your infernal rot loud enough when you are drunk.What do you mean by abusing people in that way?—you old useless boozer, you!” "
"“我也是不由自主。那些话你一句也别记住。你不该听的。”","“Can’t help it.Don’t remember anything about it.You shouldn’t listen.” "
"“你竟敢对我这么说话！你老是这么醉醺醺的，是什么意思？” ","“You dare to tell me!What do you mean by going on a drunk like this!” "
"“别问我啦。对那该死的锅炉感到厌烦——你也会的。对生活感到厌烦。”","“Don’t ask me.Sick of the dam’ boilers—you would be.Sick of life.” "
"“那么，我巴不得你死掉。你叫我对你感到厌烦了。你不记得昨夜的大吵大闹了吗？你这个下流的老酒鬼！”","“I wish you were dead, then.You’ve made me sick of you.Don’t you remember the uproar you made last night?You miserable old soaker!” "
"“不，我不记得。也不想记得。喝酒就是喝酒。”","“No; I don’t.Don’t want to.Drink is drink.” "
"“我真不明白我为什么不把你踢出去。你在这里想要什么呢？”","“I wonder what prevents me from kicking you out.What do you want here?” "
"“接你的班。你在下边干了很久，该下班了，乔治。","“Relieve you.You’ve been long enough down there, George.” "
"“别叫我乔治——你这个喝得稀里糊涂的老流氓,你！我要是明天死掉的话，你就会饿肚子。别忘了这一点。叫马西先生。”","“Don’t you George me—you tippling old rascal, you!If I were to die to-morrow you would starve.Remember that.Say Mr. Massy.” "
"“马西先生。”另一个人呆头呆脑地重复着说。 ","“Mr. Massy,” repeated the other stolidly."
"他穿着肮脏难看的衬衫，油膩的裤子，光着的脚上套着一双旧拖鞋，头发乱蓬蓬的，眼睛迟钝、充血。马西已经为他让开路，他搭拉着脑袋笔直地冲进锅炉房去。","Disheveled, with dull blood-shot eyes, a snuffy, grimy shirt, greasy trowsers, naked feet thrust into ragged slippers, he bolted in head down directly Massy had made way for him."
"那个轮机长向周围看看。从甲板上直到船尾栏杆都是空荡荡的。所有的土著旅客这一次都在巴都贝鲁上岸了；没有别的旅客乘船。拖曳式计程仪的标度盘在船尾的黑暗里隔一定的时间就会发出叮当声。周围死一样的寂静，在布满阴云的天空下，那艘船在暗灰的、没有一丝波纹的海面上，穿过好像紧紧地贴在细长的船身上那带着海草味的、暖乎乎的、一动也不动的空气，平稳地前进，似乎在同外界隔绝的空间中浮动似的。但是马西拍了一下额头，身子微微晃了一下，抓住桅杆脚旁的一个系绳桩。","The chief engineer looked around.The deck was empty as far as the taffrail.All the native passengers had left in Batu Beru this time, and no others had joined.The dial of the patent log tinkled periodically in the dark at the end of the ship.It was a dead calm, and, under the clouded sky, through the still air that seemed to cling warm, with a seaweed smell, to her slim hull, on a sea of somber gray and unwrinkled, the ship moved on an even keel, as if floating detached in empty space.But Mr. Massy slapped his forehead, tottered a little, caught hold of a belaying-pin at the foot of the mast."
"“我快发疯了。”他咕哝着，脚步不稳地穿过甲板。下面有人在把散开的煤扒在一起——锅炉门发出当当的响声。斯特恩开始在驾驶台上吹一支新曲子。","“I shall go mad,” he muttered, walking across the deck unsteadily.A shovel was scraping loose coal down below—a fire-door clanged.Sterne on the bridge began whistling a new tune."
"惠利船长坐在床上，醒着，衣服穿得整整齐齐，他听到他的睡舱门打开的声音。他一动也不动，等着听那是谁的声音，神情显得惊人的稳重。","Captain Whalley, sitting on the couch, awake and fully dressed, heard the door of his cabin open.He did not move in the least, waiting to recognize the voice, with an appalling strain of prudence."
"一盏舱壁灯的灯光照在白漆墙壁，猩红的长毛绒地毯，以及漆着棕色清漆的桃花心木家具平面上。床下面那个白木装货箱三年来一直没有打开过，似乎惠利船长感到失去了美人号以后，他的感情不可能在世界上有容身之地了。他的双手摆在膝盖上；他的好看的头和粗浓的眉毛，从门洞里看进来，呈现出一个刚劲的侧面像。那个意料中的声音终于开口说话了。","A bulkhead lamp blazed on the white paint, the crimson plush, the brown varnish of mahogany tops.The white wood packing-case under the bed-place had remained unopened for three years now, as though Captain Whalley had felt that, after the Fair Maid was gone, there could be no abiding-place on earth for his affections.His hands rested on his knees; his handsome head with big eyebrows presented a rigid profile to the doorway.The expected voice spoke out at last."
"“好吧，再说一回。我该叫你什么呢?”","“Once more, then.What am I to call you?” "
" 哈！马西。又来了。这种腻烦的局面折磨得他心都要碎了——耻辱的感觉使他痛苦得几乎忍不住要哭出来。 ","Ha!Massy.Again.The weariness of it crushed his heart—and the pain of shame was almost more than he could bear without crying out."
"“嘿。还是‘合伙人’吗” ","“Well.Is it to be ‘partner’ still?” "
"“你不懂得自己在说什么话。”","“You don’t know what you ask.” "
"“我懂得我要什么……” ","“I know what I want...” "
"马西跨进舱房，关上房门。","Massy stepped in and closed the door."
"“……而且我要再试一回，跟你谈谈。”","“...And I am going to have a try for it with you once more.” "
"他的发牢骚的话既带有劝诱的口气，又有威胁的意味。","His whine was half persuasive, half menacing."
"“因为跟我说你穷是没有一点用处的。你不把一分钱花在自己的身上，这的确是事实；不过这样做也会背上别的名声。你以为，你将要从我这里得到三年来你想要的一切，然后把我抛开，不用听听我对你的想法。你以为，我要是早就知道你在世界上只有那可怜巴巴的五百镑的话，我会听任你那么神气活现，逆来顺受。你应该早就告诉我的。”","“For it’s no manner of use to tell me that you are poor.You don’t spend anything on yourself, that’s true enough; but there’s another name for that.You think you are going to have what you want out of me for three years, and then cast me off without hearing what I think of you.You think I would have submitted to your airs if I had known you had only a beggarly five hundred pounds in the world.You ought to have told me.” "
"“也许是这样，”惠利船长低着头说，“不过，话说回来, 这笔钱救了你。”马西轻蔑地笑起来。“我后来可是经常告诉你的。”","“Perhaps,” said Captain Whalley, bowing his head.“And yet it has saved you.”...Massy laughed scornfully....“I have told you often enough since.” "
"“现在我不相信你的话了。有时我想到自己忍气吞声地让你在我的船上称王称霸！你还记得你经常会为了我的上衣和你的驾驶台狠狠地骂我吗？这是他的地盘。他的驾驶台！‘我才不愿跟这样的人合伙哪——我没法想象竟然会干这种事。’老实人！现在都暴露出来了。‘我穷，我做不到。我在这个世界上只有这么五百镑。’”","“And I don’t believe you now.When I think how I let you lord it over my ship!Do you remember how you used to bullyrag me about my coat and @your@ bridge?It was in his way.@His@ bridge!‘And I won’t be a party to this—and I couldn’t think of doing that.’ Honest man!And now it all comes out.‘I am poor, and I can’t.I have only this five hundred in the world.’” "
"他注视着一动不动的惠利船长，这老人似乎是他人生道路上不可征服的障碍。他的脸上显出沮丧的神情。","He contemplated the immobility of Captain Whalley, that seemed to present an inconquerable obstacle in his path.His face took a mournful cast."
"“你是个铁石心肠的人。”","“You are a hard man.” "
"“别说了，”惠利船长转过身去，对着他说，“你从我这里一分钱也得不到的，因为我现在一分钱也拿不出了。”","“Enough,” said Captain Whalley, turning upon him.“You shall get nothing from me, because I have nothing of mine to give away now.” "
"“谁相信你这套鬼话！”","“Tell that to the marines!” "
"马西先生走出舱房，回头看了一下；接着房门关上了，惠利船长独自坐着,像刚才那样一动也不动。他自己已经一无所有——甚至他自己过去的荣誉、诚实、正直的骄傲都烟消云散了。他的毫无污点的生活已经陷入了深渊。他已经永远跟那种生活告别了。 可是凡是属于她的，他是要一心保全的。那只是一小笔钱罢了。他会亲手交到她的面前——一个活得太久的人的最后一件礼物。卑微的生活并没有压得他心灰意懒、死气沉沉，他心里突然涌起一阵巨大而强烈的冲动，那是做父亲的对女儿的热爱，使他盼望看到她的脸。","Mr. Massy, going out, looked back once; then the door closed, and Captain Whalley, alone, sat as still as before.He had nothing of his own—even his past of honor, of truth, of just pride, was gone.All his spotless life had fallen into the abyss.He had said his last good-by to it.But what belonged to @her@, that he meant to save.Only a little money.He would take it to her in his own hands—this last gift of a man that had lasted too long.And an immense and fierce impulse, the very passion of paternity, flamed up with all the unquenched vigor of his worthless life in a desire to see her face."
"就在甲板对面，马西已经径直走到他的舱房里，点了火，在寻找那张记着他梦中看到的那个号码的条子，那些数字使他的心里涌起跟另一个人一样强烈的激情。无论如何，他一定要想方设法不错过一次开奖。这个号码准有苗头。可是他要用什么方法才能给自己弄到钱呢？","Just across the deck Massy had gone straight to his cabin, struck a light, and hunted up the note of the dreamed number whose figures had flamed up also with the fierceness of another passion.He must contrive somehow not to miss a drawing.That number meant something.But what expedient could he contrive to keep himself going?"
"“该死的小气鬼！”他咕哝道。","“Wretched miser!” he mumbled."
"如果斯特恩先生找不到时间来告诉他任何有关他合伙人的新情况的话，他倒可能告诉斯特恩先生，除了可以利用一个人的疾病把他撵走以外，疾病还能有别的用处，就是利用这一点来推迟一年归还那笔伤脑筋的钱款的期限。一直不把他生病的秘密揭穿，使他呆着不走，是更好的方法。他要是没有别的去处的话，就会急于留下；归还他股金的问题就解决了。他并不确定，惠利船长的不称职到了什么程度；然而如果他竟然把船永远搁浅在什么地方的话，那可不是船主的过错——对不对？船长有什么毛病，他并不是非知道不可的。然而，可能没有人会提起这件事，而船是十足保了险的。他一直按捺着自己的脾气交保险费。不过，他考虑的还不止是这些。他没法相信惠利船长穷得这么惨，认为这个老人还有一些钱藏在什么地方。如果他马西能拿到那笔钱的活，就可以买新锅炉，那就一切跟以前一样了。要是船终于沉掉的话更好。他恨这艘船；他恨透了那些打扰他思考发财机会的烦心事。他巴不得这艘船沉在海底，把保险费装进衣兜。他心情沮丧地离开惠利船长的舱房，这时他既恨这艘锅炉有毛病的船，又恨那个眼睛看不清的人。","If Mr. Sterne could at no time have told him anything new about his partner, he could have told Mr. Sterne that another use could be made of a man’s affliction than just to kick him out, and thus defer the term of a difficult payment for a year.To keep the secret of the affliction and induce him to stay was a better move.If without means, he would be anxious to remain; and that settled the question of refunding him his share.He did not know exactly how much Captain Whalley was disabled; but if it so happened that he put the ship ashore somewhere for good and all, it was not the owner’s fault—was it?He was not obliged to know that there was anything wrong.But probably nobody would raise such a point, and the ship was fully insured.He had had enough self-restraint to pay up the premiums.But this was not all.He could not believe Captain Whalley to be so confoundedly destitute as not to have some more money put away somewhere.If he, Massy, could get hold of it, that would pay for the boilers, and everything went on as before.And if she got lost in the end, so much the better.He hated her: he loathed the troubles that took his mind off the chances of fortune.He wished her at the bottom of the sea, and the insurance money in his pocket.And as, baffled, he left Captain Whalley’s cabin, he enveloped in the same hatred the ship with the worn-out boilers and the man with the dimmed eyes."
"我们的行为，毕竟在很大程度上取决于外界的影响, 要不是杰克喝醉了酒嘀咕的话，他会马上跟那个可恶的家伙大干一场的，那个家伙既不帮忙，又不呆下去，还不沉掉船。那个老骗子！他恨不得把他撵走。但是他按捺住自己的脾气。有的是时间——只要他高兴就行。别人的提醒使他的脑子里产生了一个新的可怕的念头。他不是毕竟干得成的吗？那个畜生杰克叫得多凶啊！“找到一个靠得住的花招来摆脱那艘船。” 嗯，杰克的话并没有什么错。他想到了一个聪明的花招。啊！冒险又算得了什么呢？","And our conduct after all is so much a matter of outside suggestion, that had it not been for his Jack’s drunken gabble he would have there and then had it out with this miserable man, who would neither help, nor stay, nor yet lose the ship.The old fraud!He longed to kick him out.But he restrained himself.Time enough for that—when he liked.There was a fearful new thought put into his head.Wasn’t he up to it after all?How that beast Jack had raved!“Find a safe trick to get rid of her.” Well, Jack was not so far wrong.A very clever trick had occurred to him.Aye!But what of the risk?"
"他心中不由得涌起一阵骄傲的感觉——不受世俗偏见束缚的骄傲的感觉，他的心跳加快了，嘴发干。不是人人都敢干这种事的；但是他是马西，他干得成！ ","A feeling of pride—the pride of superiority to common prejudices—crept into his breast, made his heart beat fast, his mouth turn dry.Not everybody would dare; but he was Massy, and he was up to it!"
"甲板上钟声响了六下。十一点啦！他喝了一杯水，坐了大约十分钟的光景，使心情平静下来。然后从柜里取出一盏他自己的牛眼灯，把灯点亮。","Six bells were struck on deck.Eleven!He drank a glass of water, and sat down for ten minutes or so to calm himself.Then he got out of his chest a small bull’s-eye lantern of his own and lit it."
"几乎在他的睡舱对面，隔着驾驶台下面那条狭窄的通道，在掩盖炉前框和锅炉的那座铁的甲板建筑物中间，有一间贮藏室，铁的墙、铁的屋顶，由于下面热，地板也是铁板的。各种各样的垃圾都塞在那里。角落里有一堆废铁；还有一排排空油罐、一包包废纱头、一堆木炭、一个甲板锻炉、一个散了架的旧鸡棚、破破烂烂的绞车罩、残缺不全的灯，还有一顶主人不要的棕色毡帽，帽主现在已经死了（害热病死在了巴西海岸上），他曾经在苏法拉号上干过，多少年来，他一直蜷缩着身子睡在一节不知什么时候被人从轮机舱里扔出来的破裂的铜管后边。这个乱七八糟堆放着被遗忘了的东西的地方，漆黑一片，没有一丝亮光。马西先生的牛眼灯射出一道小小的、倾斜的灯光，刺穿了这片黑暗。","Almost opposite his berth, across the narrow passage under the bridge, there was, in the iron deck-structure covering the stokehold fiddle and the boiler-space, a storeroom with iron sides, iron roof, iron-plated floor, too, on account of the heat below.All sorts of rubbish was shot there: it had a mound of scrap-iron in a corner; rows of empty oil-cans; sacks of cotton-waste, with a heap of charcoal, a deck-forge, fragments of an old hencoop, winch-covers all in rags, remnants of lamps, and a brown felt hat, discarded by a man dead now (of a fever on the Brazil coast), who had been once mate of the Sofala, had remained for years jammed forcibly behind a length of burst copper pipe, flung at some time or other out of the engine-room.A complete and imperious blackness pervaded that Capharnaum of forgotten things.A small shaft of light from Mr. Massy’s bull’s-eye fell slanting right through it."
"他的上衣没有扣上。他拴上了门上的插销（没有其他的入口）。然后，他蹲在那堆废铁面前，在他的衣兜里塞满了一块块废铁。他装得很小心，似乎那些生锈的螺帽、断了的插销、运货链的链环都是金子，而这一次是他唯一把它们拿走的机会一样。他把他两侧的衣兜、胸兜和里面的衣兜都塞得鼓起来了。他一件件地检查那些废铁。有一些他不要。他那双忙碌的双手周围扬起一阵小小的铁锈粉末的云雾。马西先生对他的小花招还懂得一点科学根据。你要是想要使船上罗盘的磁针偏斜的话，最好用熟铁；短上衣的衣兜里放上许多小块也比放几大块效力大，因为块数多，你就有更多的表面去产生影响，而起作用的正是表面。","His coat was unbuttoned; he shot the bolt of the door (there was no other opening), and, squatting before the scrap-heap, began to pack his pockets with pieces of iron.He packed them carefully, as if the rusty nuts, the broken bolts, the links of cargo chain, had been so much gold he had that one chance to carry away.He packed his side-pockets till they bulged, the breast pocket, the pockets inside.He turned over the pieces.Some he rejected.A small mist of powdered rust began to rise about his busy hands.Mr. Massy knew something of the scientific basis of his clever trick.If you want to deflect the magnetic needle of a ship’s compass, soft iron is the best; likewise many small pieces in the pockets of a jacket would have more effect than a few large ones, because in that way you obtain a greater amount of surface for weight in your iron, and it’s surface that tells."
"他很快地溜出去——只要跨两大步就行了——在他的舱房里，他看到自己的两只手通红——铁锈染红的。这使他惊慌失措，似乎他发现手上沾满了鲜血一样。他急忙察看全身。啊呀，他的裤子上也是！他刚才在裤子上擦过沾着铁锈的手掌。","He slipped out swiftly—two strides sufficed—and in his cabin he perceived that his hands were all red—red with rust.It disconcerted him, as though he had found them covered with blood: he looked himself over hastily.Why, his trousers too!He had been rubbing his rusty palms on his legs."
"他匆忙中扯掉了腰带钮扣，刷上衣，洗手。接着，他不再显出犯罪的模样，坐下来等待。","He tore off the waistband button in his haste, brushed his coat, washed his hands.Then the air of guilt left him, and he sat down to wait."
"他在椅子上坐得笔直，身上装满了沉重的废铁。他两个屁股兜里都塞着一大堆坚硬的废铁；他吸一口气就感到衣兜里的碎铁擦他的肋骨；他的肩膀感到这些废铁往下沉的分量。他呆呆地坐在那里，看起来神情很阴郁；一双黑眼睛一动也不动，沉着的黄脸上微微流露出冷淡而悲伤的神情。","He sat bolt upright and weighted with iron in his chair.He had a hard, lumpy bulk against each hip, felt the scrappy iron in his pockets touch his ribs at every breath, the downward drag of all these pounds hanging upon his shoulders.He looked very dull too, sitting idle there, and his yellow face, with motionless black eyes, had something passive and sad in its quietness."
"当他听到头顶上响起八下钟声的时候，他站起身来准备走出去。他的动作好像是没有目标的；他的下嘴唇微微有点下垂; 他的眼睛打量着舱房周围，但是他的意志的巨大压力已经使他没有一点智力了。","When he heard eight bells struck above his head, he rose and made ready to go out.His movements seemed aimless, his lower lip had dropped a little, his eyes roamed about the cabin, and the tremendous tension of his will had robbed them of every vestige of intelligence."
"随着最后一下钟声，水手长悄无声息地出现在了驾驶台上，来接大副的班。斯特恩因为不再有什么欲望，所以脾气特别好。","With the last stroke of the bell the Serang appeared noiselessly on the bridge to relieve the mate.Sterne overflowed with good nature, since he had nothing more to desire."
"“你的眼睛能看清吗，水手长？天相当黑；我等到你视力正常以后再走。”","“Got your eyes well open yet, Serang?It’s middling dark; I’ll wait till you get your sight properly.” "
"那个马来老人咕哝了一下，抬起他那双疲劳的眼睛向上看，侧着身子走到罗经柜的灯光中，背着双手，盯着罗盘面看。","The old Malay murmured, looked up with his worn eyes, sidled away into the light of the binnacle, and, crossing his hands behind his back, fixed his eyes on the compass-card."
"“你得仔细注意前面的陆地出现，大约在三点半光景。不过，陆地是相当清楚的。你来的时候，去看过船长吗——嗯？他知道时间吧？好，那么我走了。”","“You’ll have to keep a good look-out ahead for land, about half-past three.It’s fairly clear, though.You have looked in on the captain as you came along—eh?He knows the time?Well, then, I am off.” "
"在扶梯脚旁，他站在一边，好让船长走过去。他看着船长迈着均匀、稳定的脚步走上去以后，还站住脚思索了片刻。“真奇怪，”他对自己说，“你无论如何都拿不准这个人到底看到了你呢, 还是没看到你。这一回，他可能听到了我呼吸的声音。”","At the foot of the ladder he stood aside for the captain.He watched him go up with an even, certain tread, and remained thoughtful for a moment.“It’s funny,” he said to himself, “but you can never tell whether that man has seen you or not.He might have heard me breathe this time.” "
"归根结蒂他是个了不起的人。据说在他的全盛时代，他声名远扬。斯特恩完全能够相信；后来，他从容地得出一个结论，惠利船长一定多少能看出一点人影——譬如说，就像刚才看到他自己——但是分不清是谁，因为害怕泄露秘密，不得不老是保持着对什么都不注意的沉默态度。斯特恩先生是个精明的猜测者。","He was a wonderful man when all was said and done.They said he had had a name in his day.Mr. Sterne could well believe it; and he concluded serenely that Captain Whalley must be able to see people more or less—as himself just now, for instance—but not being certain of anybody, had to keep up that unnoticing silence of manner for fear of giving himself away.Mr. Sterne was a shrewd guesser."
"惠利船长随时随地都不得不装出这副模样，心里感到弄虚作假的耻辱。他原来怀着做父亲的爱，不相信自己会得这样的病，无限地信任上帝对世人的感情会给出公正的回应，以至于渐渐落到了这种地步。他要为可怜的艾薇再工作一个月；也许这种病只是暂时的。当然，上帝不会夺去他帮助自己孩子的能力，把他投入无尽的长夜而不加保护。他一直不放过每个希望；当他不幸的证据胜过希望的时候，他想方设法不去相信那些明摆着的东西。","This necessity of every moment brought home to Captain Whalley’s heart the humiliation of his falsehood.He had drifted into it from paternal love, from incredulity, from boundless trust in divine justice meted out to men’s feelings on this earth.He would give his poor Ivy the benefit of another month’s work; perhaps the affliction was only temporary.Surely God would not rob his child of his power to help, and cast him naked into a night without end.He had caught at every hope; and when the evidence of his misfortune was stronger than hope, he tried not to believe the manifest thing."
"没用。在这越来越暗的字宙中，他的思路却不幸地清晰起来。在他的痛苦渐渐明晰的时刻，他看到人生，人们，所有东西，整个世界和世界上的芸芸众生，仿佛他以前从未看到过似的。","In vain.In the steadily darkening universe a sinister clearness fell upon his ideas.In the illuminating moments of suffering he saw life, men, all things, the whole earth with all her burden of created nature, as he had never seen them before."
"有时候他会突然感到一阵头晕，一阵不可抗拒的恐怖；接着，他女儿的形象就出现了。 他以前对她也从未看得那么清楚过。这是可能的吗，他再也不能为她做任何事情了？一件事也做不成了。而且再也看不到她了吗？永远看不到了。","Sometimes he was seized with a sudden vertigo and an overwhelming terror; and then the image of his daughter appeared.Her, too, he had never seen so clearly before.Was it possible that he should ever be unable to do anything whatever for her?Nothing.And not see her any more?Never."
"为什么？他只不过稍微有点放肆，稍微有点骄傲，这种惩罚太重了。最后他终于紧紧地抓住这个骗局不放，横下心来表演到底，为了原封不动地保全这笔钱，再亲眼看到她一次。以后呢——怎么办？他是个精力充沛的男子汉，对自杀这个念头非常反感。他祈祷过死亡的来临，直到祈祷词哽在喉咙里。他一辈子带着孩子似的谦逊精神向上帝祈祷，求上帝赐给他安定的生活，不要让他受到诱惑。语言到底意味着什么？语言的能力是从什么地方来的？他剧烈的心跳在他的脑子里引起反响——好像要把他的脑子震得粉碎似的。","Why?The punishment was too great for a little presumption, for a little pride.And at last he came to cling to his deception with a fierce determination to carry it out to the end, to save her money intact, and behold her once more with his own eyes.Afterwards—what?The idea of suicide was revolting to the vigor of his manhood.He had prayed for death till the prayers had stuck in his throat.All the days of his life he had prayed for daily bread, and not to be led into temptation, in a childlike humility of spirit.Did words mean anything?Whence did the gift of speech come?The violent beating of his heart reverberated in his head—seemed to shake his brain to pieces."
"他重重地坐在躺椅上，假装值班的模样。夜很暗。如今夜夜都是暗的。","He sat down heavily in the deck-chair to keep the pretense of his watch.The night was dark.All the nights were dark now."
"“水手长。”他稍微提高声音说。","“Serang,” he said, half aloud."
"“啊，先生。我在这里。","“Ada, Tuan.I am here.” "
"“天上有云吗？” ","“There are clouds on the sky?” "
"“有，先生。”","“There are, Tuan.” "
"“让船一直前进。向北方。”","“Let her be steered straight.North.” "
"“船是在向北方前进，先生。”","“She is going north, Tuan.” "
"水手长退了下去。惠利船长听出马西的脚步声在驾驶台上。","The Serang stepped back.Captain Whalley recognized Massy’s footfalls on the bridge."
"那个轮机长走到左舷，又走回来，在他椅子背后经过了几次。惠利船长在他这样来来回回的脚步声中，听到一种近乎小心谨慎的不同寻常的特点。这个人一走近惠利船长，船长就免不了会感到精神上的痛苦。倒不是侮恨。毕竟他没有做过一件对不起那个可怜的家伙的事情，做的都是好事。但是有一种危险的感觉——需要小心的提防。","The engineer walked over to port and returned, passing behind the chair several times.Captain Whalley detected an unusual character as of prudent care in this prowling.The near presence of that man brought with it always a recrudescence of moral suffering for Captain Whalley.It was not remorse.After all, he had done nothing but good to the poor devil.There was also a sense of danger—the necessity of a greater care."
"马西站住了脚说：","Massy stopped and said— "
"“你还是一定要走吗？”","“So you still say you must go?” "
"“我确实一定要走。”","“I must indeed.” "
"“至少你能把钱放宽几年期限吧，这也不行吗？”","“And you couldn’t at least leave the money for a term of years?” "
"“不可能。”","“Impossible.” "
"“没有你的照管，就不能把钱存在我这里，嗯?”","“Can’t trust it with me without your care, eh?” "
"惠利船长沉默不语。马西在椅子背后深深地叹了口气。","Captain Whalley remained silent.Massy sighed deeply over the back of the chair."
"“你这样做是救我。”他用颤抖的声音说。","“It would just do to save me,” he said in a tremulous voice."
"“我已经救过你一回了。”","“I’ve saved you once.” "
"那个轮机长小心地脱下上衣，走过去摸那个用螺钉紧紧拧在木柱上的铜钩。为了这个目的，他站在罗经柜的正前面，这样一来，那个正在掌舵轮的舵手完全看不见罗盘的盘面了。“先生!”那个马来水手终于轻轻地说，好让那个白人知道，他没法驾驶了。","The chief engineer took off his coat with careful movements, and proceeded to feel for the brass hook screwed into the wooden stanchion.For this purpose he placed himself right in front of the binnacle, thus hiding completely the compass-card from the quartermaster at the wheel.“Tuan!” the lascar at last murmured softly, meaning to let the white man know that he could not see to steer."
"马西先生已经达到了目的。上衣挂在钩子上了，离罗经柜不到六英寸。他从那个舵手旁笔直地走过去。那是一个中年的、麻脸的苏门答腊马来人，几乎跟黑人一样黑，他惊奇地看到，在那么短短的一段时间，在平静的水面上，而且没有一点风，船却已经远远地偏离了航道。他以前从没有发现过这种情形。他带着惊奇的心情轻轻地咕哝了一声，赶紧转动舵轮，把船头重新调到向北，向北才是航道。叽叽嘎嘎的舵链声，已经走到舵轮跟前的水手长的低低的责备声，引起了一阵轻微的骚动，使惠利船长焦急地注意起来。他说：“小心一点。”接着，驾驶台上一切都跟往常一样平静无事。马西先生不见了。","Mr. Massy had accomplished his purpose.The coat was hanging from the nail, within six inches of the binnacle.And directly he had stepped aside the quartermaster, a middle-aged, pock-marked, Sumatra Malay, almost as dark as a negro, perceived with amazement that in that short time, in this smooth water, with no wind at all, the ship had gone swinging far out of her course.He had never known her get away like this before.With a slight grunt of astonishment he turned the wheel hastily to bring her head back north, which was the course.The grinding of the steering-chains, the chiding murmurs of the Serang, who had come over to the wheel, made a slight stir, which attracted Captain Whalley’s anxious attention.He said, “Take better care.” Then everything settled to the usual quiet on the bridge.Mr. Massy had disappeared."
"可是衣兜里的废铁已经发挥作用了；苏法拉号根据罗盘向北行驶，被这个简单的办法引上了歧途，不在通往潘古湾的安全航道行驶了。","But the iron in the pockets of the coat had done its work; and the Sofala, heading north by the compass, made untrue by this simple device, was no longer making a safe course for Pangu Bay."
"船头把水分开的哧哧声，船上机器的顫动声，这艘船的忠实而辛劳的生命发出的一切声音，在非常平静的海面上不受干扰地响着，大海的周围都同天空中一动也不动的云层连接在一起。像世界一样辽阔的温柔的寂静似乎等候在这艘船的航道上，用极大的爱抚裹住它。马西先生认为，要人为地使船只失事，这个夜晚是再好不过了。","The hiss of water parted by her stem, the throb of her engines, all the sounds of her faithful and laborious life, went on uninterrupted in the great calm of the sea joining on all sides the motionless layer of cloud over the sky.A gentle stillness as vast as the world seemed to wait upon her path, enveloping her lovingly in a supreme caress.Mr. Massy thought there could be no better night for an arranged shipwreck."
"船撞到潘古东面的一块礁石，搁浅在了那上面——等天亮——船底有个窟窿——登上小船——当天黄昏到达潘古湾。情况大概是这样的。船一触礁，他会急忙跑上驾驶台，拿起他的上衣 （在黑暗里没有人会注意），走到船边，把上衣倒过来抖搂，不然就干脆把它撂进海里。一件小事罢了。谁能猜得到呢？上衣挂在那个钩子上有几百回了。不过，他坐在驾驶台扶梯最低的一磴上的时候，他的两个膝盖有一点颤抖。等待的时刻是最不好受的。他不时地会开始急促地喘气，像刚奔跑过一样，接着大口地呼吸，内心里因感到那被征服的命运而沾沾自喜。他时常会听到上面水手长拖着那双赤着的脚走动的声音。人们会用平静的低低的声音交谈几句，接着就几乎立刻消失在寂静中……","Run up high and dry on one of the reefs east of Pangu—wait for daylight—hole in the bottom—out boats—Pangu Bay same evening.That’s about it.As soon as she touched he would hasten on the bridge, get hold of the coat (nobody would notice in the dark), and shake it upside-down over the side, or even fling it into the sea.A detail.Who could guess?Coat been seen hanging there from that hook hundreds of times.Nevertheless, when he sat down on the lower step of the bridge-ladder his knees knocked together a little.The waiting part was the worst of it.At times he would begin to pant quickly, as though he had been running, and then breathe largely, swelling with the intimate sense of a mastered fate.Now and then he would hear the shuffle of the Serang’s bare feet up there: quiet, low voices would exchange a few words, and lapse almost at once into silence...."
"“一看到陆地出现，马上告诉我，水手长。","“Tell me directly you see any land, Serang.” "
"“是，先生。还没有哪。”","“Yes, Tuan.Not yet.” "
"“对，还没有哪。”惠利船长心领神会地说。","“No, not yet,” Captain Whalley would agree."
"这艘船是他晚年最好的朋友。他靠苏法拉号和在苏法拉号上挣的钱一股脑寄给了他的女儿。他的思想萦绕着这个名字。从前，他和妻子时常在神鹰号的尾舱里孩子的摇床前谈论：她会长大，会结婚，会爱他们，他们会住在她附近，看她幸福地生活——谈了又谈，谈个没完没了。妻子去世了；至于那个孩子呢，他给了她一切他该给的，他巴不得他能到她附近去，看她，看一次她的脸，生活在她说话的声音中，好让那个已经为他准备好的，活人的黑暗的坟墓变得可以忍受。他渴望爱太久了。他想象她温柔的神态。","The ship had been the best friend of his decline.He had sent all the money he had made by and in the Sofala to his daughter.His thought lingered on the name.How often he and his wife had talked over the cot of the child in the big stern-cabin of the Condor; she would grow up, she would marry, she would love them, they would live near her and look at her happiness—it would go on without end.Well, his wife was dead, to the child he had given all he had to give; he wished he could come near her, see her, see her face once, live in the sound of her voice, that could make the darkness of the living grave ready for him supportable.He had been starved of love too long.He imagined her tenderness."
"水手长盯着前面看，不时地向那张躺椅瞟上一眼。他心神不安地转来转去,突然向惠利船长凑得很近地叫起来：","The Serang had been peering forward, and now and then glancing at the chair.He fidgeted restlessly, and suddenly burst out close to Captain Whalley— "
"“先生，你看到陆地出现了吗?”","“Tuan, do you see anything of the land?” "
"一听到水手长惊慌的声音，惠利船长马上站起身来。他！ 看！听到这句问话，他的眼睛似乎更看不见了，仿佛一下子病情加重了一百倍。","The alarmed voice brought Captain Whalley to his feet at once.He!See!And at the question, the curse of his blindness seemed to fall on him with a hundredfold force."
"“什么时候了 ？”他喊道。","“What’s the time?” he cried."
"“三点半，先生。”","“Half-past three, Tuan.” "
"“咱们近了。你一定要好好看着。看啊，喂。看着。”","“We are close.You @must@ see.Look, I say.Look.” "
"马西先生突然被说话的声音吵醒了，他刚才在驾驶台扶梯最低的一磴上短短地打了个盹，弄不清他怎么会呆在那里。啊！他简直要晕过去了。埋下事故的种子是一回事；在那激动的谈话声中知道悬挂在你头上的那个可怕的果子即将掉下来, 却是另一回事。","Mr. Massy, awakened by the sudden sound of talking from a short doze on the lowest step, wondered why he was there.Ah!A faintness came over him.It is one thing to sow the seed of an accident and another to see the monstrous fruit hanging over your head ready to fall in the sound of agitated voices."
"“不会有危险的。”他沙哑地咕哝着。","“There’s no danger,” he muttered thickly."
"惠利船长突然深深地感到没有把握的恐怖，他对人、对东西——对这个世界，都悲惨地不信任。他依靠同一个罗盘在这条航道上行驶了三十六次——要是世界上有什么东西是靠得住的话，那就是那个罗盘的绝对的、一丝不差的准确性。那么到底出了什么事呢？那个水手长在撒谎吗？为什么要撒谎呢？为什么？难道他的眼睛也要瞎了？","The horror of incertitude had seized upon Captain Whalley, the miserable mistrust of men, of things—of the very earth.He had steered that very course thirty-six times by the same compass—if anything was certain in this world it was its absolute, unerring correctness.Then what had happened?Did the Serang lie?Why lie?Why?Was he going blind too?"
"“有雾吗？低头看水面。低头看，喂。”","“Is there a mist?Look low on the water.Low down, I say.” "
"“先生，没有雾。你自己看吧。”","“Tuan, there’s no mist.See for yourself.” "
"惠利船长尽力使自己颤抖的四肢稳定下来。他该马上关掉机器，讲出真相吗？一阵犹豫压下了他脑子里各种各样稀奇古怪的念头。不寻常的情况出现了；他是应付不了的。在这种无法形容的痛苦中，他看到了她的脸——一个年轻姑娘的脸——这种幻想的力量简直叫人惊奇。不，他为了她已经这么干了，再怎么也不该透露自己的真相。“你让船在航道上行驶吗？你按照航道行驶了吗？老实说。”","Captain Whalley steadied the trembling of his limbs by an effort.Should he stop the engines at once and give himself away.A gust of irresolution swayed all sorts of bizarre notions in his mind.The unusual had come, and he was not fit to deal with it.In this passage of inexpressible anguish he saw her face—the face of a young girl—with an amazing strength of illusion.No, he must not give himself away after having gone so far for her sake.“You steered the course?You made it?Speak the truth.” "
"“是，先生。眼下在航道上啊。 看。”","“Ya, Tuan.On the course now.Look.” "
"惠利船长迈开大步走到罗经柜前。对他来说，那是无边无际、没有形状的黑影中一点模糊的亮光。他的脸低下去，一直凑到玻璃上，他从前能……","Captain Whalley strode to the binnacle, which to him made such a dim spot of light in an infinity of shapeless shadow.By bending his face right down to the glass he had been able before..."
"他的身子弯得那么低，他知道那里有一根柱子，就出于本能地伸出胳膊去，打算在那上面靠一下，以保持身体平稳。他的手握到一样东西，不是木头，而是衣料。他轻轻一拉增加了重量，那个挂衣圈断了。马西先生的上衣掉了下来，沉甸甸地落到甲板上，发出沉闷的砰的一声，还有许多咔哒咔哒的声音。","Having to stoop so low, he put out, instinctively, his arm to where he knew there was a stanchion to steady himself against.His hand closed on something that was not wood but cloth.The slight pull adding to the weight, the loop broke, and Mr. Massy’s coat falling, struck the deck heavily with a dull thump, accompanied by a lot of clicks."
"“那是什么？”","“What’s this?” "
"惠利船长跪在地上伸出双手摸索，很明显地露出瞎子的模样。他的手颤抖着，那两只在摸索事实真相的手。他发觉了。 罗盘附近有铁。错误的航道。让船出事！他的船！啊，不行。那不行。","Captain Whalley fell on his knees, with groping hands extended in a frank gesture of blindness.They trembled, these hands feeling for the truth.He saw it.Iron near the compass.Wrong course.Wreck her!His ship.Oh no.Not that."
"“马上停船！”他吼道，声音不像是从他喉咙里发出来的了。","“Jump and stop her!” he roared out in a voice not his own."
"他自己跑起来——双手伸在前面，一副瞎子的模样。这时候，皿形钟的当当声响遍了全船，船似乎猛地撞在了山坡上。","He ran himself—hands forward, a blind man, and while the clanging of the gong echoed still all over the ship, she seemed to butt full tilt into the side of a mountain."
"这时海峡北面正是低潮。马西先生没有估计到。苏法拉号不是一半船身搁浅，而是撞在一块涨潮时会淹没的礁石的陡脊上。这一撞引起的震荡简直能把人吓死。船上每一个站着的人都被震得摔倒在地上。摇晃的索具使桅杆上的小木冠发出巨大的咔哒咔哒的声音。所有的灯都熄灭了，几根牵链崩断了,叮叮当当地撞在烟囱上。撞击的声音、断了的钢丝缆的嘶嘶的声音、爆裂的声音、响亮的折断的声音。桅顶灯在船头上空碎裂；甲板上所有的门都开始沉重地砰砰撞击。船撞了一下，又弹回来，然后第二次撞上去，像攻城槌似的撞在原来的地方。这艘船完全被毁坏了。牵链都崩断了；烟囱随着一阵空洞的轰隆声倒下来，把舵轮砸得粉碎，把天篷架压得稀烂，把贮物舱完全撞坏，弄得驾驶台上满地都是大堆的碎片、木条和断木头。惠利船长站起身来，立在和膝盖一样高的毁坏了的东西中间，皮肉都撕破了，淌着血。他主要是靠那阵声音才逃过那场危险的。他知道那场危险的性质，手里拿着马西先生的那件上衣。","It was low water along the north side of the strait.Mr. Massy had not reckoned on that.Instead of running aground for half her length, the Sofala butted the sheer ridge of a stone reef which would have been awash at high water.This made the shock absolutely terrific.Everybody in the ship that was standing was thrown down headlong: the shaken rigging made a great rattling to the very trucks.All the lights went out: several chain-guys, snapping, clattered against the funnel: there were crashes, pings of parted wire-rope, splintering sounds, loud cracks, the masthead lamp flew over the bows, and all the doors about the deck began to bang heavily.Then, after having hit, she rebounded, hit the second time the very same spot like a battering-ram.This completed the havoc: the funnel, with all the guys gone, fell over with a hollow sound of thunder, smashing the wheel to bits, crushing the frame of the awnings, breaking the lockers, filling the bridge with a mass of splinters, sticks, and broken wood.Captain Whalley picked himself up and stood knee-deep in wreckage, torn, bleeding, knowing the nature of the danger he had escaped mostly by the sound, and holding Mr. Massy’s coat in his arms."
"这时候斯特恩（他已经从自己的卧舱里冲出来了）操纵机器，使船后退。机器运转了几下，接着有一个声音喊道：“从该死的轮机室里滚出去，杰克！”然后机器就停住了；不过，船已经离开了礁石，一动也不动地停着；从甲板上破裂的管子里冒出一片浓密的水蒸气烟雾，在黑夜中一缕缕地消失。尽管突然发生灾祸，没有一个人嚷嚷咧咧，似乎那激烈的震荡把许多在甲板上影影绰绰、摇摇晃晃的人，震得几乎魂不附体了。水手长清晰的声音超过那阵混乱的低语声传来：","By this time Sterne (he had been flung out of his bunk) had set the engines astern.They worked for a few turns, then a voice bawled out, “Get out of the damned engine-room, Jack!”—and they stopped; but the ship had gone clear of the reef and lay still, with a heavy cloud of steam issuing from the broken deckpipes, and vanishing in wispy shapes into the night.Notwithstanding the suddenness of the disaster there was no shouting, as if the very violence of the shock had half-stunned the shadowy lot of people swaying here and there about her decks.The voice of the Serang pronounced distinctly above the confused murmurs— "
"“八英寻深。”他已经用测深锤测过了。","“Eight fathom.” He had heaved the lead."
"接下来，斯特恩先生紧张地扯着嗓门喊叫：","Mr. Sterne cried out next in a strained pitch— "
"“船到底开到什么地方了？咱们在哪里？”","“Where the devil has she got to?Where are we?” "
"惠利船长用平静、低沉的声音回答：","Captain Whalley replied in a calm bass— "
"“在东面的礁石群中间。”","“Amongst the reefs to the eastward.” "
"“你知道在什么地方的，先生？那么船再也开不出去了。”","“You know it, sir?Then she will never get out again.” "
"“五分钟以后，船就要沉了。放小船，斯特恩。就算只有一艘小船，在这么风平浪静的海面上，你们都会得救的。”","“She will be sunk in five minutes.Boats, Sterne.Even one will save you all in this calm.” "
"那些烧炉子的中国人混乱地向左舷的救生船冲去。没有人试图阻止他们。那些马来人乱了一阵，平静了下来。斯特恩先生神情沉着。惠利船长一动不动。他的思想比这个使他第一次损失一艘船的黑夜更加黑暗。","The Chinaman stokers went in a disorderly rush for the port boats.Nobody tried to check them.The Malays, after a moment of confusion, became quiet, and Mr. Sterne showed a good countenance.Captain Whalley had not moved.His thoughts were darker than this night in which he had lost his first ship."
"“他使我失去了一艘船。”","“He made me lose a ship.” "
"另一条高高的人影站在驾驶台上，就在他面前。他的周围满地都是毁坏了的东西的碎片。他发疯似地低声说：","Another tall figure standing before him amongst the litter of the smash on the bridge whispered insanely— "
"“别提那事。”","“Say nothing of it.” "
"马西磕磕绊绊地走得更近了。惠利船长听到他牙齿咔哒咔哒打颤的声音。","Massy stumbled closer.Captain Whalley heard the chattering of his teeth."
"“我拿到了那件上衣。”","“I have the coat.” "
"“把它扔掉走吧，”他声音颤抖地催船长，“小—小—小—小—船！”","“Throw it down and come along,” urged the chattering voice.“B-b-b-b-boat!” "
"“你会为这件事被判上十五年。”","“You will get fifteen years for this.” "
"马西先生已经无法像样地说话了！他的话憋在喉咙里，只是一阵又沙又干的声音。","Mr. Massy had lost his voice.His speech was a mere dry rustling in his throat."
"“行行好吧!”","“Have mercy!” "
"“你在使我失去我的船的时候，你想到过行行好吗？马西先生，你要为这件事判十五年！”","“Had you any when you made me lose my ship?Mr. Massy, you shall get fifteen years for this!” "
"“我需要钱！钱！我自己的钱！我会给你一部分钱的。分给你一半。你自己不是也爱钱。”","“I wanted money!Money!My own money!I will give you some money.Take half of it.You love money yourself.” "
"“还有公道……”","“There’s a justice...” "
"马西做出极大的努力，用奇怪而有点哽咽的声音说：","Massy made an awful effort, and in a strange, half choked utterance— "
"“你这个瞎子！是你逼得我这么干的。”","“You blind devil!It’s you that drove me to it.” "
"惠利船长把那件上衣搂在胸前，一声也不吭。光明永远从世界上消失了——一切都由它去吧。但是这个人不该逍遥法外。","Captain Whalley, hugging the coat to his breast, made no sound.The light had ebbed for ever from the world—let everything go.But this man should not escape scot-free."
"斯特恩的声音在发命令：","Sterne’s voice commanded— "
"“把小船放下去!”","“Lower away!” "
"滑轮咯吱咯吱地转动。","The blocks rattled."
"“现在，”他喊道，“你们都没事了。这边走。你，杰克，来这里。马西先生！马西先生！船长！快，先生！咱们上——”","“Now then,” he cried, “over with you.This way.You, Jack, here.Mr. Massy!Mr. Massy!Captain!Quick, sir!Let’s get— "
"“我为了骗取保险费会坐牢；不过，你会暴露真相。 你，你这个老实人一直在欺骗我。你很穷。不是吗？除了那五百镑以外你什么也没有。嘿，现在你一无所有了。船损失了，保险费又拿不到。”","“I shall go to prison for trying to cheat the insurance, but you’ll get exposed; you, honest man, who has been cheating me.You are poor.Aren’t you?You’ve nothing but the five hundred pounds.Well, you have nothing at all now.The ship’s lost, and the insurance won’t be paid.” "
"惠利船长一动也不动。说得对！艾薇的钱！在这次船只失事中完了。他脑子里突然闪过一个念头，看清了这件事的后果。他的确是走投无路了。","Captain Whalley did not move.True!Ivy’s money!Gone in this wreck.Again he had a flash of insight.He was indeed at the end of his tether."
"大伙催促的叫声从一旁传来。马西似乎没法离开驾驶台一样。他绝望地用颤抖而咬牙切齿的声音说:","Urgent voices cried out together alongside.Massy did not seem able to tear himself away from the bridge.He chattered and hissed despairingly— "
"“把上衣给我！给我！”","“Give it up to me!Give it up!” "
"“不，”惠利船长说，“我不能给你。你还是走的好。别等了，老弟，你要是想活命的话。船头那边正在快速地下沉。不。上衣我要留着；不过，我要呆在这艘船上。”","“No,” said Captain Whalley; “I could not give it up.You had better go.Don’t wait, man, if you want to live.She’s settling down by the head fast.No; I shall keep it, but I shall stay on board.” "
"马西似乎没听懂，不过他对性命的热爱突然觉醒，赶紧从驾驶台上跑掉了。","Massy did not seem to understand; but the love of life, awakened suddenly, drove him away from the bridge."
"惠利放下上衣，从一堆堆毁坏了的东西中间磕磕绊绊地走到船边。","Captain Whalley laid the coat down, and stumbled amongst the heaps of wreckage to the side."
"“马西先生跟你们一起在小船上吗? ”他对着黑夜喊叫。 ","“Is Mr. Massy in with you?” he called out into the night."
"斯特恩在船上嚷道：","Sterne from the boat shouted— "
"“在，我们让他上船了。来吧，先生。再待下去简直是发疯了。”","“Yes; we’ve got him.Come along, sir.It’s madness to stay longer.” "
"惠利船长小心地沿着栏杆摸索，接着无声无息地解开小船的缆索。他们仍然在等他下去。他们等着，直到有一个声音突然叫起来：","Captain Whalley felt along the rail carefully, and, without a word, cast off the painter.They were expecting him still down there.They were waiting, till a voice suddenly exclaimed— "
"“我们的船漂开了！快开船！”","“We are adrift!Shove off!” "
"“惠利船长！跳啊！动作麻利点……跳！你会游泳的啊。”","“Captain Whalley!Leap!...pull up a little...leap!You can swim.” "
"在他年老的心中，在他精力充沛的身体中，存在着对死亡的恐惧。很明显这是不可能没有的，这种恐惧显然不能被失明的恐惧所压倒。可是为了艾薇，他到底达到了他的目的，尽管在黑暗中走到了犯罪的边缘。上帝不听他的祈祷。光明终止了，从世界上消失了；没有一丝亮光。世界是一个黑暗的垃圾堆。但是一个姓惠利的人竟然做出这样的事来才达到了目的，再活下去是不适宜的。他得付出代价。","In that old heart, in that vigorous body, there was, that nothing should be wanting, a horror of death that apparently could not be overcome by the horror of blindness.But after all, for Ivy he had carried his point, walking in his darkness to the very verge of a crime.God had not listened to his prayers.The light had finished ebbing out of the world; not a glimmer.It was a dark waste; but it was unseemly that a Whalley who had gone so far to carry a point should continue to live.He must pay the price."
"“尽可能跳得远，先生。我们会把你从水里救出来的。”","“Leap as far as you can, sir; we will pick you up.” "
"他们没有听到他的回答。可是他们的叫声似乎提醒了他一件事情。他摸索着走回去，去找马西的那件上衣。他确实会游泳。被沉船的旋涡卷到水下去的人们，有时候会浮到水面上来。一个姓惠利的人既然已经下定决心不愿再活下去，被机会作弄，再去挣扎是不适宜的。他要把那些废铁全部放进自己的衣兜。","They did not hear him answer.But their shouting seemed to remind him of something.He groped his way back, and sought for Mr. Massy’s coat.He could swim indeed; people sucked down by the whirlpool of a sinking ship do come up sometimes to the surface, and it was unseemly that a Whalley, who had made up his mind to die, should be beguiled by chance into a struggle.He would put all these pieces of iron into his own pockets."
"他们在小船上看到，苏法拉号可怕地斜躺在黑沉沉的海面上，一个黑魆魆的庞然大物，一动也不动。船上没有一丝声音。然后，随着一阵巨大而奇怪的乱糟糟的响声，似乎锅炉冲破舱壁似的，随着一阵轻微的低沉的爆炸声，那艘船所在的地方，有片刻，出现了一样笔直和狭长的东西，像海面上的一块岩石。接下来连那样东西也消失了。","They, looking from the boat, saw the Sofala, a black mass upon a black sea, lying still at an appalling cant.No sound came from her.Then, with a great bizarre shuffling noise, as if the boilers had broken through the bulkheads, and with a faint muffled detonation, where the ship had been there appeared for a moment something standing upright and narrow, like a rock out of the sea.Then that too disappeared."
"苏法拉号没有能按照规定日期回到巴都贝鲁来，范怀克先生马上知道他再也看不到那艘船了。但是他不知道究竟出了什么事，直到几个月以后，他向他那个苏丹借了一艘当地的小船，来到苏法拉号的船籍港，才清楚了事情的经过。那个港口的人对有过那么一艘船，以及对那艘船的沉没所做的官方调查，都已经开始遗忘了。","When the Sofala failed to come back to Batu Beru at the proper time, Mr. Van Wyk understood at once that he would never see her any more.But he did not know what had happened till some months afterwards, when, in a native craft lent him by his Sultan, he had made his way to the Sofala’s port of registry, where already her existence and the official inquiry into her loss was beginning to be forgotten."
"除了船长跟沉船一起沉入水底这个事实以外，这算不上什么很吸引人的或是有趣的故事。只死了他一个人。范怀克先生要不是遇到斯特恩的话，就不可能知道事情的细节。有一天，他在那条小河上的那座桥附近的码头上，几乎就是惠利船长为了原封不动地保全他女儿的五百镑，而去叫一条舢板送他登上苏法拉号的地方，遇见了斯特恩。","It had not been a very remarkable or interesting case, except for the fact that the captain had gone down with his sinking ship.It was the only life lost; and Mr. Van Wyk would not have been able to learn any details had it not been for Sterne, whom he met one day on the quay near the bridge over the creek, almost on the very spot where Captain Whalley, to preserve his daughter’s five hundred pounds intact, had turned to get a sampan which would take him on board the Sofala."
"范怀克先生从远处看到斯特恩使劲向他眨眼，还把手举到帽边上。他们走到一座建筑物（那是一家银行）的阴影里。大副就叙述起来，在出事以后过了约莫六个小时的样子，那条小船就把全体人员送到了潘古湾；他们在那个糟糕透顶的地方过着苦得没命的日子，呆了两个礼拜后才找到一个离开的机会。调查的结果宣布没有一个人应该对事故负责。造成船只失事的原因是不同寻常的潮流。说实话不可能有其他的原因。找不出别的原因来说明那艘船在午夜值勤的时候会向东偏离它的方位七英里。","From afar Mr. Van Wyk saw Sterne blink straight at him and raise his hand to his hat.They drew into the shade of a building (it was a bank), and the mate related how the boat with the crew got into Pangu Bay about six hours after the accident, and how they had lived for a fortnight in a state of destitution before they found an opportunity to get away from that beastly place.The inquiry had exonerated everybody from all blame.The loss of the ship was put down to an unusual set of the current.Indeed, it could not have been anything else: there was no other way to account for the ship being set seven miles to the eastward of her position during the middle watch."
"“我运气不好，先生。”","“A piece of bad luck for me, sir.” "
"斯特恩先生伸出舌头舔舔他的嘴唇，向旁边瞟了一眼。“我失去了被你雇用的机会，先生。我一辈子都会感到遗憾的。不过俗话说得好，对一个人是灾殃，对另一个人来说倒是好事。就算是马西先生亲手布置这次船只失事，他也不可能安排得更为巧妙。我以前从没有听过这么及时的全部损失。”","Sterne passed his tongue on his lips, and glanced aside.“I lost the advantage of being employed by you, sir.I can never be sorry enough.But here it is: one man’s poison, another man’s meat.This could not have been handier for Mr. Massy if he had arranged that shipwreck himself.The most timely total loss I’ve ever heard of.” "
"“那个马西怎么样了 ？”范怀克先生问。","“What became of that Massy?” asked Mr. Van Wyk."
"“他吗，先生？哈！哈！他总是跟我说，他打算再买一艘船。不过他把钱一放进衣兜，一大早就溜上了开往马尼拉去的邮船。我一直追到船上；他告诉我，他肯定会在马尼拉发财的。我可以滚开了，他才管不着呢。然而他几乎是在明说， 如果我不多嘴的话，他答应让我当船长。”","“He, sir? Ha! ha!He would keep on telling me that he meant to buy another ship; but as soon as he had the money in his pocket he cleared out for Manilla by mail-boat early in the morning.I gave him chase right aboard, and he told me then he was going to make his fortune dead sure in Manilla.I could go to the devil for all he cared.And yet he as good as promised to give me the command if I didn’t talk too much.” "
"“你始终什么也没有说……”范怀克先生开口了。","“You never said anything...” Mr. Van Wyk began."
"“我没有，先生。我为什么要说呢？我打算发迹，可是死人不会妨碍我。”斯特恩说。他的眼皮很快地眨巴着，接着耷拉了片刻。“再说，先生，这是一件尴尬的事情。你让我把这件事瞒得有点太久了。”","“Not I, sir.Why should I?I mean to get on, but the dead aren’t in my way,” said Sterne.His eyelids were beating rapidly, then drooped for an instant.“Besides, sir, it would have been an awkward business.You made me hold my tongue just a bit too long.” "
"“你知道惠利船长为什么要留在船上吗？他真的拒绝离开吗？喂，说啊！也许那只是意外……？”","“Do you know how it was that Captain Whalley remained on board?Did he really refuse to leave?Come now!Or was it perhaps an accidental...?” "
"“不是！”斯特恩使劲地打断他的话，“我可以确定地说，当时我大喊大嚷，叫他跳海。他一定干脆自己解开了小船的缆索。我们都对他嚷叫——杰克跟我。他甚至不回答我们。直到最后船上像坟墓那样寂静无声。接下来，锅炉掉进了海里，船也就沉了。意外！不可能！我老实告诉你，先生，他那套把戏玩完了。” ","“Nothing!” Sterne interrupted with energy.“I tell you I yelled for him to leap overboard.He simply @must@ have cast off the painter of the boat himself.We all yelled to him—that is, Jack and I.He wouldn’t even answer us.The ship was as silent as a grave to the last.Then the boilers fetched away, and down she went.Accident!Not it!The game was up, sir, I tell you.” "
"这就是斯特恩要说的一切。","This was all that Sterne had to say."
"范怀克先生当然被请到俱乐部去当两周的客人，在那里他遇到了那个律师，马西和惠利船长的协定就是在他的事务所里签订的。","Mr. Van Wyk had been of course made the guest of the club for a fortnight, and it was there that he met the lawyer in whose office had been signed the agreement between Massy and Captain Whalley."
"“一个不同寻常的老人，”他说，“你可以说他不知道是从什么地方来的，带着五百镑来投资，那个轮机员焦虑地跟在他后面。现在他有点莫名其妙地去世了，就像他来的时候一样。我始终不是太了解他。那个马西就一点也没有神秘莫测的地方，是吗？我不明白惠利为什么要拒绝离开那艘船。那真是蠢事。他是没有责任的，法庭已经做出裁决了。”","“Extraordinary old man,” he said.“He came into my office from nowhere in particular as you may say, with his five hundred pounds to place, and that engineer fellow following him anxiously.And now he is gone out a little inexplicably, just as he came.I could never understand him quite.There was no mystery at all about that Massy, eh?I wonder whether Whalley refused to leave the ship.It would have been foolish.He was blameless, as the court found.” "
"范怀克先生说自己和惠利很熟，他不会相信惠利是自杀的。自杀这种做法不符合他知道的那个人的性格。","Mr. Van Wyk had known him well, he said, and he could not believe in suicide.Such an act would not have been in character with what he knew of the man."
"“我的意见也是这样。”那个律师表示同意。一般的推测是船长为了要抢救什么重要的东西，而在船上呆得太久了。也许是能证明他无辜的航海图，要不就是他的舱房里有什么贵重的东西。小船的缆索自动漂开了，人们这样推测着。可是，说来也奇怪，在那次航行前不久，可怜的惠利来到那个律师的办公室，留下一个写着他女儿地址的封着的信封，嘱咐等他死后寄给艾薇。尽管如此，这件事也算不上很异常，尤其是他那样年纪的人。范怀克先生摇摇头。惠利船长看起来能活上一百岁。","“It is my opinion, too,” the lawyer agreed.The general theory was that the captain had remained too long on board trying to save something of importance.Perhaps the chart which would clear him, or else something of value in his cabin.The painter of the boat had come adrift of itself it was supposed.However, strange to say, some little time before that voyage poor Whalley had called in his office and had left with him a sealed envelope addressed to his daughter, to be forwarded to her in case of his death.Still it was nothing very unusual, especially in a man of his age.Mr. Van Wyk shook his head.Captain Whalley looked good for a hundred years."
"“说得完全对，”那个律师表示同意，“那个老头好像是完全长成了，带着那些长胡子来到这个世界上似的。不知为何，我怎么也无法想象他比较年轻或是更年老的模样——你知道吗？人们还感觉到那个人肉体的力量。凡是跟他接触的人，个个都被这个人身体里某种特殊的东西吸引住，也许秘密就在这里。任何能使我们其他人送命的手段看来都摧毁不了他。他的从容不迫、落落大方、彬彬有礼的态度都是含有深意的。好像他确信他有足够的时间来处理一切事情一样。可不是，他身上显出一种没法摧毁的气概。有时候听他谈话的口气，你可以认为他自己也是这么想的。他带着那封要我保管的信，最后一次来找我的时候，神情一点也不沮丧。也许他的谈话和神态比往常更从容。没有一丁点的沮丧。他有不祥的预感吗？也许有吧！然而，对这么一个引人注目的人来说，这是一个很悲惨的结局。”","“Perfectly true,” assented the lawyer.“The old fellow looked as though he had come into the world full-grown and with that long beard.I could never, somehow, imagine him either younger or older—don’t you know.There was a sense of physical power about that man too.And perhaps that was the secret of that something peculiar in his person which struck everybody who came in contact with him.He looked indestructible by any ordinary means that put an end to the rest of us.His deliberate, stately courtesy of manner was full of significance.It was as though he were certain of having plenty of time for everything.Yes, there was something indestructible about him; and the way he talked sometimes you might have thought he believed it himself.When he called on me last with that letter he wanted me to take charge of, he was not depressed at all.Perhaps a shade more deliberate in his talk and manner.Not depressed in the least.Had he a presentiment, I wonder?Perhaps!Still it seems a miserable end for such a striking figure.” "
"“啊，可不是！这是一个很悲惨的结局。”范怀克先生说，神情是那么激烈，那个律师不由得好奇地抬起头来看他。后来跟范怀克先生分手以后，他跟一个熟人说：","“Oh yes!It was a miserable end,” Mr. Van Wyk said, with so much fervor that the lawyer looked up at him curiously; and afterwards, after parting with him, he remarked to an acquaintance— "
"“那个从巴都贝鲁来的荷兰烟草种植园主很奇怪。知道他的情况吗?”","“Queer person that Dutch tobacco-planter from Batu Beru.Know anything of him?” "
"“钱多得很，”那个银行经理回答，“我听说他要乘下一班邮船回家去组织一个公司，以接管他的产业。另一个种植烟草的地区被打开了。他很聪明，我想。不会永远有这样的好时机的。”","“Heaps of money,” answered the bank manager.“I hear he’s going home by the next mail to form a company to take over his estates.Another tobacco district thrown open.He’s wise, I think.These good times won’t last for ever.” "
"住在南半球的惠利船长的女儿，打开那个信封的时候，写在信封上的她的地址和姓名是那个律师的笔迹，她并没有不祥的预感。她是在下午收到那封信的。房客们都出去了；她的孩子都上学去了；她的丈夫捧着一本书，坐在楼上那张大扶手椅里，面容消瘦，毯子一直裹到腰部。整所房子是寂静的。三扇高大的玻璃窗外是灰沉沉的、阴云密布的天空。","In the southern hemisphere Captain Whalley’s daughter had no presentiment of evil when she opened the envelope addressed to her in the lawyer’s handwriting.She had received it in the afternoon; all the boarders had gone out, her boys were at school, her husband sat upstairs in his big arm-chair with a book, thin-faced, wrapped up in rugs to the waist.The house was still, and the grayness of a cloudy day lay against the panes of three lofty windows."
"在一间寒酸的餐室里，一年到头微微有一股冷冰冰的餐具味，有一张长餐桌，桌子周围排着许多推在桌旁的椅子，椅背都贴在一直铺着的桌布边。她坐在餐桌的一头，看着开头的句子:“最深切的遗憾——这真是令人痛苦的职责——你的父亲已经不在人间——按照他的指示——出事身亡——慰问——他无可指摘地活在別人的记忆中……”","In a shabby dining-room, where a faint cold smell of dishes lingered all the year round, sitting at the end of a long table surrounded by many chairs pushed in with their backs close against the edge of the perpetually laid table-cloth, she read the opening sentence: “Most profound regret—painful duty—your father is no more—in accordance with his instructions—fatal casualty—consolation—no blame attached to his memory....” "
"她的脸是消瘦的；在束着发带的光滑的黑发下，太阳穴微微凹下去；她的嘴唇一直坚决地紧闭着；她的黑眼睛越睁越大，直到最后她低低地叫了一声，站起身来，接着她马上弯下身子，拾起另一个从她膝盖上掉到地板上的信封。","Her face was thin, her temples a little sunk under the smooth bands of black hair, her lips remained resolutely compressed, while her dark eyes grew larger, till at last, with a low cry, she stood up, and instantly stooped to pick up another envelope which had slipped off her knees on to the floor."
"她拆开信封,很快抽出信纸。","She tore it open, snatched out the inclosure...."
"“我最亲爱的孩子，”信上写着，“趁我还能用清楚的字迹写信给你的时候，我写下这封信。我费了很大力气为你存着所有剩下来的钱；我保留着这笔钱，无非是为了更好地帮助你。钱是你的。它绝不会受到损失；它不会被动用。有五百镑。直到现在为止，我挣的钱一分也不留。至于将来，我如果还活着的话，我一定要留下一些——一点——好让我去看你。我一定要去看你。我一定要再看见你一次。","“My dearest child,” it said, “I am writing this while I am able yet to write legibly.I am trying hard to save for you all the money that is left; I have only kept it to serve you better.It is yours.It shall not be lost: it shall not be touched.There’s five hundred pounds.Of what I have earned I have kept nothing back till now.For the future, if I live, I must keep back some—a little—to bring me to you.I must come to you.I must see you once more."
"“简直难以相信你会看到这封信。上帝好像已经把我忘了。我想要看看你——然而死亡将是更大的恩惠。如果你看到这些字句的话，我吩咐你首先要感谢上帝终于变得仁慈了，因为那时我已经死了，而这是件好事。亲爱的，我走投无路了。” ","“It is hard to believe that you will ever look on these lines.God seems to have forgotten me.I want to see you—and yet death would be a greater favor.If you ever read these words, I charge you to begin by thanking a God merciful at last, for I shall be dead then, and it will be well.My dear, I am at the end of my tether.” "
"下一段是这样开头的：“我的视力快要……”","The next paragraph began with the words: “My sight is going...” "
"那一天，她不再看信。把信拿到她眼前的那只手慢慢地垂下去。她穿着一身家常的黑衣服，柔软的身子直挺挺地走到窗前。她的眼睛是干的。没有悲伤的哭声或是低低的感谢声从她的嘴里发出来，升到天堂去。尽管他出于父爱尽了一切努力，生活一直还是太艰苦。这已经使她不再流露自己的感情了。可是这些年来，生活的痛苦，对贫穷的焦虑操心，对糊口所作的艰苦挣扎的羞愧，第一次消失了。甚至她丈夫和孩子们的形象似乎都从她眼前飘走，隐入了灰蒙蒙的幕色之中。她只看到父亲的脸，仿佛他看她来了，那是一张总是神情安详的大脸盘，跟她最后一次看到的时候一模一样，只是相貌更庄严、更亲切。","She read no more that day.The hand holding up the paper to her eyes fell slowly, and her slender figure in a plain black dress walked rigidly to the window.Her eyes were dry: no cry of sorrow or whisper of thanks went up to heaven from her lips.Life had been too hard, for all the efforts of his love.It had silenced her emotions.But for the first time in all these years its sting had departed, the carking care of poverty, the meanness of a hard struggle for bread.Even the image of her husband and of her children seemed to glide away from her into the gray twilight; it was her father’s face alone that she saw, as though he had come to see her, always quiet and big, as she had seen him last, but with something more august and tender in his aspect."
"她把那封折叠的信塞在她那件家常穿的黑背心的两颗钮扣中间，伸出额头靠在一块窗玻璃上，一直靠到暮色苍茫，一动不动，她把能挤出来的时间都给了他。去世！这可能吗？ 我的上帝，这可能吗！这个打击因为在莫大的世界上分居两地，因为多年不见，而有所缓和。有多少日子，她整天不想他——没有时间。但是她一直爱着他，她觉得她毕竟是一直爱着他的。 ","She slipped his folded letter between the two buttons of her plain black bodice, and leaning her forehead against a window-pane remained there till dusk, perfectly motionless, giving him all the time she could spare.Gone!Was it possible?My God, was it possible!The blow had come softened by the spaces of the earth, by the years of absence.There had been whole days when she had not thought of him at all—had no time.But she had loved him, she felt she had loved him, after all."
