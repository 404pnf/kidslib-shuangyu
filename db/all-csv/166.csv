"陈阿春","Chun Ah Chun"
"作者：杰克·伦敦","by Jack London"
"陈阿春的外貌没有什么特别出众之处。他和一般中国人一样相当矮小，有着中国式的窄肩膀和瘦削身材。一般的游客偶然在火奴鲁鲁的街上瞥见他，会推断他是个性情温和的小个子中国人，很可能经营着一家生意兴隆的洗衣房或裁缝铺。说到他温和又富有，这种看法倒没错，尽管并不够标准，因为阿春的好性情与他的富有程度一样，至于他有多富裕却没有人知道一星半点的详情。众所周知他非常有钱，但是谈到他的财产时，人们只是用“非常”来象征一个未知的数目。","There was nothing striking in the appearance of Chun Ah Chun.He was rather undersized, as Chinese go, and the Chinese narrow shoulders and spareness of flesh were his.The average tourist, casually glimpsing him on the streets of Honolulu, would have concluded that he was a good-natured little Chinese, probably the proprietor of a prosperous laundry or tailorshop.In so far as good nature and prosperity went, the judgment would be correct, though beneath the mark; for Ah Chun was as good-natured as he was prosperous, and of the latter no man knew a tithe the tale.It was well known that he was enormously wealthy, but in his case “enormous” was merely the symbol for the unknown."
"阿春有着一双精明的小眼睛，又黑又亮，而且小得就像一个钻孔一般。但是他的两只眼睛分得很开，躲在额头之下，那显然是一位思想家的额头。因为阿春有他自己的麻烦，而且这些麻烦一生都伴随着他。但并不是说他一直都在为这些麻烦事烦恼。本质上他是一位哲学家，不管身为苦力、亿万富翁还是掌管很多工人的老板，他的灵魂一直都平静泰然。他总是生活在一种高度的平和之中，内心镇静从容，不因好运而踌躇不前，不因厄运而心烦意乱。他能很好地适应一切事情，不管是甘蔗地里监工的殴打，还是他自己经营甘蔗地时蔗糖价格突然暴跌。因此，从他那种坚若磐石的自信和满足中可以看出，他精于解决难题，很少有人会遇到并去思考这些难题，更别提一个中国农民了。","Ah Chun had shrewd little eyes, black and beady and so very little that they were like gimlet-holes.But they were wide apart, and they sheltered under a forehead that was patently the forehead of a thinker.For Ah Chun had his problems, and had had them all his life.Not that he ever worried over them.He was essentially a philosopher, and whether as coolie, or multi-millionaire and master of many men, his poise of soul was the same.He lived always in the high equanimity of spiritual repose, undeterred by good fortune, unruffled by ill fortune.All things went well with him, whether they were blows from the overseer in the cane field or a slump in the price of sugar when he owned those cane fields himself.Thus, from the steadfast rock of his sure content he mastered problems such as are given to few men to consider, much less to a Chinese peasant."
"他正是那样的——一个中国农民，生来就得像牲口一样整日在地里劳作，但注定会像童话中的王子一样逃脱这种命运。阿春对他的父亲没有什么记忆，只知道他是离广东不远的一个地方的一个小农民；他也不怎么记得自己的母亲，因为她在他六岁时就过世了。但他却记得他那位受人尊敬的伯父——阿高，因为从六岁到二十四岁，阿春一直都在给他当奴隶。就在二十四岁那年，他卖身为苦力逃走了，要去夏威夷的甘蔗种植园里做三年苦工，每天只有五十美分工钱。","He was precisely that—a Chinese peasant, born to labour in the fields all his days like a beast, but fated to escape from the fields like the prince in a fairy tale.Ah Chun did not remember his father, a small farmer in a district not far from Canton; nor did he remember much of his mother, who had died when he was six.But he did remember his respected uncle, Ah Kow, for him had he served as a slave from his sixth year to his twenty-fourth.It was then that he escaped by contracting himself as a coolie to labour for three years on the sugar plantations of Hawaii for fifty cents a day."
"阿春很善于观察。即便是千里挑一的人物也不曾注意到的小细节，他都能觉察到。他在甘蔗地里干了三年，到了最后他对甘蔗种植的了解比监工、甚至总管都要多，而且这个枯瘦矮小的苦力所掌握的关于磨坊里还原过程的知识，也一定会让总管目瞪口呆。但阿春不仅学习了制糖工艺。他还研究过别人是如何成为制糖厂主和种植园主的。他很早就得出过一个判断，即人是无法通过自己双手的劳动致富的。他明白这个道理，是因为他自己已经苦干了二十年。那些变得富有的人之所以能够致富，都是因为别人双手的劳动。谁拥有最多的人为他苦干，谁就是最富有的。","Ah Chun was observant.He perceived little details that not one man in a thousand ever noticed.Three years he worked in the field, at the end of which time he knew more about cane-growing than the overseers or even the superintendent, while the superintendent would have been astounded at the knowledge the weazened little coolie possessed of the reduction processes in the mill.But Ah Chun did not study only sugar processes.He studied to find out how men came to be owners of sugar mills and plantations.One judgment he achieved early, namely, that men did not become rich from the labour of their own hands.He knew, for he had laboured for a score of years himself.The men who grew rich did so from the labour of the hands of others.That man was richest who had the greatest number of his fellow creatures toiling for him."
"所以，苦力合同到期后，阿春就用自己的积蓄投资了一家小型进口商店，同一个叫阿杨的人合伙。这家公司最终发展成为伟大的“阿春和阿杨”公司，经营项目从印度丝绸、人参到鸟粪岛和贩运黑奴用的双桅横帆船无所不包。同时，阿春还受雇做了厨师。他是位好厨师，三年之内他就成为了火奴鲁鲁薪酬最高的主厨。他的工作稳定，就像他的老板丹廷说的那样，他要放弃这个工作简直就是个傻瓜。但阿春最了解自己的想法，虽然知道自己会被称作一个大傻瓜，知道在应得的工资之外老板还会送他50美元，他还是放弃了这份工作。","So, when his term of contract was up, Ah Chun invested his savings in a small importing store, going into partnership with one, Ah Yung.The firm ultimately became the great one of “Ah Chun and Ah Yung,” which handled anything from India silks and ginseng to guano islands and blackbird brigs.In the meantime, Ah Chun hired out as cook.He was a good cook, and in three years he was the highest-paid chef in Honolulu.His career was assured, and he was a fool to abandon it, as Dantin, his employer, told him; but Ah Chun knew his own mind best, and for knowing it was called a triple-fool and given a present of fifty dollars over and above the wages due him."
"阿春和阿杨的公司蒸蒸日上。阿春再也没有必要做一个厨师了。那时正是夏威夷兴盛繁荣的时期。甘蔗广泛种植，需要大量劳工。阿春发现了这个机会，于是投身到劳工输入行业。他把数以千计的广东苦力引进夏威夷，他的财富开始增长。他还进行投资。别人看来要破产的领域，在他又亮又黑的小眼睛里却是笔笔生意。他低价买进了一片鱼塘，后来获得了五倍的收益，以此为契机，他垄断了火奴鲁鲁的整个鱼市。他不在刊物上发表谈论，不投身政治，也不参加革命，但他对于事态的预测比那些策划这些事件的人更清晰、更长远。当火奴鲁鲁在上升的珊瑚岩形成的一片贫瘠的沙洲之上，布局零散，凌乱不堪，饱受沙尘袭击之时，他就已经在脑海中预见到它会成为一个现代化、由电力点亮的城市。所以他开始买进土地。他从需要现金的商人、一贫如洗的当地人、放荡的商人之子、寡妇孤儿以及被驱逐到莫洛凯岛的麻风病人手里买进土地；然而，不知怎的，他买的那些土地若干年后证明正符合仓库、咖啡厅或是旅馆的需要。他的土地租入租出，卖出买进，然后再卖出。","The firm of Ah Chun and Ah Yung was prospering.There was no need for Ah Chun longer to be a cook.There were boom times in Hawaii.Sugar was being extensively planted, and labour was needed.Ah Chun saw the chance, and went into the labour-importing business.He brought thousands of Cantonese coolies into Hawaii, and his wealth began to grow.He made investments.His beady black eyes saw bargains where other men saw bankruptcy.He bought a fish-pond for a song, which later paid five hundred per cent and was the opening wedge by which he monopolized the fish market of Honolulu.He did not talk for publication, nor figure in politics, nor play at revolutions, but he forecast events more clearly and farther ahead than did the men who engineered them.In his mind’s eye he saw Honolulu a modern, electric-lighted city at a time when it straggled, unkempt and sand-tormented, over a barren reef of uplifted coral rock.So he bought land.He bought land from merchants who needed ready cash, from impecunious natives, from riotous traders’ sons, from widows and orphans and the lepers deported to Molokai; and, somehow, as the years went by, the pieces of land he had bought proved to be needed for warehouses, or coffee buildings, or hotels.He leased, and rented, sold and bought, and resold again."
"但他还进行了别的投资。他信赖地将钱投在了一个没人会信任的叛逆的船长帕金森身上。帕金森扬帆远航，开始去往了维加小岛的神秘之旅。帕金森直到去世都被照顾得很好，数年之后，有消息走露说德克雷和阿科伦鸟粪岛已经以75万的价格卖给了英国磷酸盐信托机构，这让火奴鲁鲁岛的人们惊讶不已。然后在卡拉卡瓦国王所统治的富足奢华的时期，阿春花了30万美元换得了鸦片经营许可证。如果他花33万买断这种毒品的专营权，这项投资仍然很划算，因为获得的效益使他买下了卡拉劳种植园，这个种植园反过来又在17年间每年盈利30％，最后被他以150万的价钱售出。","But there were other things as well.He put his confidence and his money into Parkinson, the renegade captain whom nobody would trust.And Parkinson sailed away on mysterious voyages in the little Vega.Parkinson was taken care of until he died, and years afterward Honolulu was astonished when the news leaked out that the Drake and Acorn guano islands had been sold to the British Phosphate Trust for three-quarters of a million.Then there were the fat, lush days of King Kalakaua, when Ah Chun paid three hundred thousand dollars for the opium licence.If he paid a third of a million for the drug monopoly, the investment was nevertheless a good one, for the dividends bought him the Kalalau Plantation, which, in turn, paid him thirty per cent for seventeen years and was ultimately sold by him for a million and a half."
"很久以前，在卡米哈米哈统治时期时，他曾任中国领事——这个职位也不是完全没油水可捞；卡米哈米哈四世在位时，为了和斯特拉·艾伦代尔结婚，他改变国籍成为了一名夏威夷国民。而斯特拉自己也是这个棕色皮肤国王的臣民，虽然她身体里流淌的盎格鲁-撒克逊族血液多过波利尼西亚族血液。事实上，各种血统在她身体里杂糅，已经稀薄到只能以八分之一和十六分之一来衡量的程度。那十六分之一的血统来自她的曾祖母帕好——帕好公主，因为她来自皇室。斯特拉·艾伦代尔的曾祖父是布伦特上校，一个在卡米哈米哈一世统治之下服役的英国冒险家，他本身还被任命为塔布首领。  她的祖父曾是新贝德福德市捕鲸船的船长，而她的父亲又将嫁接于他自身的英国血统之上的那种关系疏远的意大利和葡萄牙混合血统引了进来。尽管从法律上讲，阿春的妻子是个夏威夷人，但其实她更大程度上应该算是其他三个种族中的任何一个。","It was under the Kamehamehas, long before, that he had served his own country as Chinese Consul—a position that was not altogether unlucrative; and it was under Kamehameha IV that he changed his citizenship, becoming an Hawaiian subject in order to marry Stella Allendale, herself a subject of the brown-skinned king, though more of Anglo-Saxon blood ran in her veins than of Polynesian.In fact, the random breeds in her were so attenuated that they were valued at eighths and sixteenths.In the latter proportions was the blood of her great-grandmother, Paahao—the Princess Paahao, for she came of the royal line.Stella Allendale’s great-grandfather had been a Captain Blunt, an English adventurer who took service under Kamehameha I and was made a tabu chief himself.Her grandfather had been a New Bedford whaling captain, while through her own father had been introduced a remote blend of Italian and Portuguese which had been grafted upon his own English stock.Legally a Hawaiian, Ah Chun’s spouse was more of any one of three other nationalities."
"而且，阿春又将自己的蒙古族混血注入到了这个种族大杂烩之中。所以，阿春夫人生的孩子有1/32波利尼西亚血统，1/16意大利血统，1/16葡萄牙血统，一半的中国血统，还有11/32的英美血统。如果阿春预见到了这种结合可能衍生出来这样一个令人惊叹的大家庭，很可能他就会克制自己不结婚了。这个家庭在很多方面来说都是令人惊叹的。首先，是家庭的规模。共有十五个儿女，其中女儿居多。三个儿子首先出生，之后就坚持不懈地连着出生了整整一打女孩。种族混血的效果绝妙。不但后代子女众多，而且无一例外都健健康康、毫无缺陷。但这家人最神奇的地方在于他们的美丽。所有的女孩都很漂亮——精致纤巧、飘逸动人。阿春夫人的丰满线条好像正好缓和了阿春的瘦削轮廓，所以女儿们个个苗条却不干瘦，圆润却不臃肿。每张脸上的每个特征都能让人联想起亚洲，而这些特征又都被老英格兰，新英格兰以及南欧的特征所操控和掩盖了。在不知情的情况下，任何观察者都不会猜到他们血管中竟有着如此浓的中国血缘；而一旦被告知，所有观察者都会立即注意到孩子们身上的中国痕迹。","And into this conglomerate of the races, Ah Chun introduced the Mongolian mixture.Thus, his children by Mrs. Ah Chun were one thirty-second Polynesian, one-sixteenth Italian, one sixteenth Portuguese, one-half Chinese, and eleven thirty-seconds English and American.It might well be that Ah Chun would have refrained from matrimony could he have foreseen the wonderful family that was to spring from this union.It was wonderful in many ways.First, there was its size.There were fifteen sons and daughters, mostly daughters.The sons had come first, three of them, and then had followed, in unswerving sequence, a round dozen of girls.The blend of the race was excellent.Not alone fruitful did it prove, for the progeny, without exception, was healthy and without blemish.But the most amazing thing about the family was its beauty.All the girls were beautiful—delicately, ethereally beautiful.Mamma Ah Chun’s rotund lines seemed to modify papa Ah Chun’s lean angles, so that the daughters were willowy without being lathy, round-muscled without being chubby.In every feature of every face were haunting reminiscences of Asia, all manipulated over and disguised by Old England, New England, and South of Europe.No observer, without information, would have guessed, the heavy Chinese strain in their veins; nor could any observer, after being informed, fail to note immediately the Chinese traces."
"作为美女，阿春的女儿们是一种新型的美。人们从没见过这样的混血美女。她们彼此惊人地相似，但每个人却又截然不同。人们从不会把一个错认成另外一个。另一方面，蓝眼睛、金头发的莫德会立即使人想起亨里埃塔，她有着橄榄褐色的皮肤，一双含情脉脉、又大又黑的眼睛和一头蓝黑色的头发。她们之间细微的相似之处调和了她们之间的每一点差异，这是阿春的贡献。在阿春提供的基础之上，人们能发现种族混血的各种模式。他提供了中国人纤细的身形，在此之上又加上了撒克逊、拉丁和波利尼西亚人身体的纤巧和细致。","As beauties, the Ah Chun girls were something new.Nothing like them had been seen before.They resembled nothing so much as they resembled one another, and yet each girl was sharply individual.There was no mistaking one for another.On the other hand, Maud, who was blue-eyed and yellow-haired, would remind one instantly of Henrietta, an olive brunette with large, languishing dark eyes and hair that was blue-black.The hint of resemblance that ran through them all, reconciling every differentiation, was Ah Chun’s contribution.He had furnished the groundwork upon which had been traced the blended patterns of the races.He had furnished the slim-boned Chinese frame, upon which had been builded the delicacies and subtleties of Saxon, Latin, and Polynesian flesh."
"阿春相信阿春夫人有自己的主意，尽管当这些主意同他自己哲人似的平静相冲突时，从来不允许她表达出来。她整个一生都习惯于欧洲式的生活方式。而且适应得很好。阿春送给她了一座欧式风格的宅邸。之后，当他的儿女们长到可以出主意的年纪，他又建了一幢平房，布局设计宽敞而不拘章法，宏伟而不张扬。又过了一段时间，一座山地住宅在坦塔罗斯矗立了起来，南边吹来“令人恶心的风”时全家可以去那儿避一避。在怀基基滩上他还建了一座占地宽广的海滨住宅，地址选得如此绝妙以至于后来当美国政府为建防御工事征用这栋房子时，还给了他一大笔钱。他所有的房子里都有台球室、吸烟室和大量的客房，因为阿春那令人惊叹的后代热衷于丰富的娱乐活动。室内陈设极为简单。国王们的赎金都被毫不张扬地花掉了——多亏了其后代有素养的品位。","Mrs. Ah Chun had ideas of her own to which Ah Chun gave credence, though never permitting them expression when they conflicted with his own philosophic calm.She had been used all her life to living in European fashion.Very well.Ah Chun gave her a European mansion.Later, as his sons and daughters grew able to advise, he built a bungalow, a spacious, rambling affair, as unpretentious as it was magnificent.Also, as time went by, there arose a mountain house on Tantalus, to which the family could flee when the “sick wind” blew from the south.And at Waikiki he built a beach residence on an extensive site so well chosen that later on, when the United States government condemned it for fortification purposes, an immense sum accompanied the condemnation.In all his houses were billiard and smoking rooms and guest rooms galore, for Ah Chun’s wonderful progeny was given to lavish entertainment.The furnishing was extravagantly simple.Kings’ ransoms were expended without display—thanks to the educated tastes of the progeny."
"在子女的教育问题上，阿春一直很开明。“别在乎花费，”从前当那个懈怠的水手看不出维加岛有任何理由适于航行时，阿春就曾跟帕金森争辩过，“你只负责行船，我来付钱。”他也是这样告诉自己的儿女的。他们只需要接受教育，不用计较花费。大儿子哈罗德曾先后在哈佛和牛津上过学；艾伯特和查尔斯在耶鲁一起上过课。而女儿们，从年纪最大的往下，都在加州米尔斯学院进行了预备性学习，之后去了瓦瑟学院、韦尔斯利学院或是布林莫尔学院学习。一直向往欧洲的几个孩子，将她们求学的最后一笔放在了欧洲。阿春的儿女从世界各地回到他的身边，为他朴素而又宏伟的府邸提供装饰的意见和建议。阿春自己喜欢东方装饰的奢华辉煌，但作为一个哲学家，他清楚地知道，就西方标准来说，孩子们的品位是正确的。","Ah Chun had been liberal in the matter of education.“Never mind expense,” he had argued in the old days with Parkinson when that slack mariner could see no reason for making the Vega seaworthy; “you sail the schooner, I pay the bills.”And so with his sons and daughters.It had been for them to get the education and never mind the expense.Harold, the eldest-born, had gone to Harvard and Oxford; Albert and Charles had gone through Yale in the same classes.And the daughters, from the eldest down, had undergone their preparation at Mills Seminary in California and passed on to Vassar, Wellesley, or Bryn Mawr.Several, having so desired, had had the finishing touches put on in Europe.And from all the world Ah Chun’s sons and daughters returned to him to suggest and advise in the garnishment of the chaste magnificence of his residences.Ah Chun himself preferred the voluptuous glitter of Oriental display; but he was a philosopher, and he clearly saw that his children’s tastes were correct according to Western standards."
"当然，他的孩子们并没有被称为阿春的子女。他从一个苦力劳工发展成为一个亿万富翁，他的名字也随之有所进化。阿春夫人以前将它拼写为“A'Chun”，但她的儿女们更加聪明，省掉了撇号，把它拼作“Achun”。阿春没有反对。他名字的拼写一点儿也不会妨碍到他的舒适或是他那哲人似的平静。而且，他并不以此为傲。但是当孩子们的建议到了让他穿上浆的衬衫、笔挺的领子和双排扣男式长礼服的程度时，就着实干扰了他的舒适和安宁。阿春一概不接受。他更喜欢中国宽松飘逸的长袍，无论他们是哄骗还是威吓，都不能让他作出改变。他们两种方法都试过了，采用后一种办法时遭受到了尤为惨重的失败。他们可没白去美国。他们从有组织的劳工身上学到了联合抵制的优点。而对于他，他们的父亲陈阿春，他们就在他自己的房子里对他采取抵制，阿春夫人则在一旁怂恿帮忙。阿春自己虽然不谙西方文化，但对西方国家的劳工状况却了如指掌。他自己就雇佣了众多劳工，他知道怎么对付他们的伎俩。他立即对自己反叛的子女和犯错的妻子采取了停工政策。他遣散了他的数十个仆人，锁上马厩，关了房子，自己住进了夏威夷皇家饭店，而他正好是这家企业最大的股东。全家人心烦意乱地奔忙着，同朋友一起四处寻访，而阿春则镇定自如地处理着自己的诸多事务，抽着带银质小烟斗的长烟筒，一边思考着他那些优秀的子女们的问题。","Of course, his children were not known as the Ah Chun children.As he had evolved from a coolie labourer to a multi-millionaire, so had his name evolved.Mamma Ah Chun had spelled it A’Chun, but her wiser offspring had elided the apostrophe and spelled it Achun.Ah Chun did not object.The spelling of his name interfered no whit with his comfort nor his philosophic calm.Besides, he was not proud.But when his children arose to the height of a starched shirt, a stiff collar, and a frock coat, they did interfere with his comfort and calm.Ah Chun would have none of it.He preferred the loose-flowing robes of China, and neither could they cajole nor bully him into making the change.They tried both courses, and in the latter one failed especially disastrously.They had not been to America for nothing.They had learned the virtues of the boycott as employed by organized labour, and he, their father, Chun Ah Chun, they boycotted in his own house, Mamma Achun aiding and abetting.But Ah Chun himself, while unversed in Western culture, was thoroughly conversant with Western labour conditions.An extensive employer of labour himself, he knew how to cope with its tactics.Promptly he imposed a lockout on his rebellious progeny and erring spouse.He discharged his scores of servants, locked up his stables, closed his houses, and went to live in the Royal Hawaiian Hotel, in which enterprise he happened to be the heaviest stockholder.The family fluttered distractedly on visits about with friends, while Ah Chun calmly managed his many affairs, smoked his long pipe with the tiny silver bowl, and pondered the problem of his wonderful progeny."
"但这个问题并没有打扰他的平静。在他哲学家的内心之中，他知道一旦时机成熟，他就会解决这个问题。同时他也给家人们加深了教训：虽然他可能对一些事情不甚关心，但他仍然是阿春家族命运的绝对独裁者。家人苦撑了一周，然后和阿春以及仆人们一起回来了，这座平房里又住满了人。从此以后，当阿春决定穿着蓝色丝质长袍和棉拖鞋，戴着帽顶镶着红纽扣的黑色丝质无沿便帽，走进他那富丽堂皇的客厅时，或是当他在宽广的游廊或吸烟室里，选择当着那些抽香烟或雪茄的官员或平民的面用自己烟竿细长、带着银质烟斗的烟筒抽烟时，再也有没人表示过异议。","This problem did not disturb his calm.He knew in his philosopher’s soul that when it was ripe he would solve it.In the meantime he enforced the lesson that complacent as he might be, he was nevertheless the absolute dictator of the Achun destinies.The family held out for a week, then returned, along with Ah Chun and the many servants, to occupy the bungalow once more.And thereafter no question was raised when Ah Chun elected to enter his brilliant drawing-room in blue silk robe, wadded slippers, and black silk skull-cap with red button peak, or when he chose to draw at his slender-stemmed silver-bowled pipe among the cigarette-and cigar-smoking officers and civilians on the broad verandas or in the smoking room."
"阿春在火奴鲁鲁占据着独特的地位。虽然他不在交际场上出现，他却有资格出席任何场合。他从不外出，除非是和本市的中国商人们一道；但他会接待客人，而且他总是一家子的中心和他宴会桌上的主角。尽管自己是中国农民出身，但他却在管辖的所有的岛屿上营造出了一种独一无二的文化气息和高雅氛围。岛上没有任何人会因为太过傲慢而拒绝迈过他家的门槛去享受他的款待。首先，阿春的平房建得无可挑剔。其次，阿春本身就代表一种势力。最后，阿春是个道德楷模，是个讲诚信的生意人。尽管岛上的商业道德水准比大陆上的要高，但阿春在诚信方面的审慎和严格仍然使火奴鲁鲁岛上的其他商人相形见绌。有句话是这样说的，他的诺言同他的票据一样可靠。从来不需要用他的签名去约束他。他从不食言。在霍奇基斯——莫特森公司的霍奇基斯死后20年，他们在错放的文件堆里，找到了一个借给阿春三万美元贷款的交易备忘录。那是阿春给卡米哈米哈二世担任私人顾问时候发生的事。在那个喧扰混乱、忙于赚钱的全盛时期，这件事完全被阿春遗忘了。没有借据，也没有对他采取任何法律措施，但阿春还是向霍奇基斯房地产公司全额还清了欠款，同时自愿偿还了远远高过本金的复利。同样，他对损失惨重的卡其库水渠计划也做出了口头担保，在当时最不乐观的人也没有料想到担保会有必要——“先生们，他手都没抖一下就签了20万的支票，手都没抖一下啊，”那家已倒闭企业的秘书这样转述道，他被派过去时只是绝望地想能弄清楚阿春的意向。除了很多这种一诺千金的类似事件之外，岛上有名望的人几乎没有谁不曾在某个时候受过阿春的经济资助。","Ah Chun occupied a unique position in Honolulu.Though he did not appear in society, he was eligible anywhere.Except among the Chinese merchants of the city, he never went out; but he received, and he always was the centre of his household and the head of his table.Himself peasant, born Chinese, he presided over an atmosphere of culture and refinement second to none in all the islands.Nor were there any in all the islands too proud to cross his threshold and enjoy his hospitality.First of all, the Achun bungalow was of irreproachable tone.Next, Ah Chun was a power.And finally, Ah Chun was a moral paragon and an honest business man.Despite the fact that business morality was higher than on the mainland, Ah Chun outshone the business men of Honolulu in the scrupulous rigidity of his honesty.It was a saying that his word was as good as his bond.His signature was never needed to bind him.He never broke his word.Twenty years after Hotchkiss, of Hotchkiss, Morterson Company, died, they found among mislaid papers a memorandum of a loan of thirty thousand dollars to Ah Chun.It had been incurred when Ah Chun was Privy Councillor to Kamehameha II.In the bustle and confusion of those heyday, money-making times, the affair had slipped Ah Chun’s mind.There was no note, no legal claim against him, but he settled in full with the Hotchkiss’ Estate, voluntarily paying a compound interest that dwarfed the principal.Likewise, when he verbally guaranteed the disastrous Kakiku Ditch Scheme, at a time when the least sanguine did not dream a guarantee necessary—“Signed his cheque for two hundred thousand without a quiver, gentlemen, without a quiver,” was the report of the secretary of the defunct enterprise, who had been sent on the forlorn hope of finding out Ah Chun’s intentions.And on top of the many similar actions that were true of his word, there was scarcely a man of repute in the islands that at one time or another had not experienced the helping financial hand of Ah Chun."
"所以，火奴鲁鲁岛上的居民看着这个出色的家庭渐渐出现复杂的问题，都开始暗自同情他，因为没有谁能想象得到阿春将如何处理这一切。但对于这个问题，阿春比他们看得都透彻。他比任何人都清楚自己在家里有多么地格格不入。他自己的家人则猜不透。他知道，在他出色的后代之中，他并没有自己的一席之地。他期待着晚年的到来，也明白对孩子们来说他会变得越来越陌生。他不理解他的孩子们。他对他们的谈话毫无兴趣，且一无所知。西方文化与他形同陌路。他是个彻彻底底的亚洲人，这就意味着他是个异类。他们信奉的基督教对他来说简直荒谬。但他只要能理解这些年轻人，他就会忽略掉所有这些细枝末节、毫不重要的事情。比如，当莫德告诉他这个月的家用开支是3万时——他能理解，这就像艾伯特向他要5万去买那艘缪里尔纵帆游艇并且加入夏威夷游艇俱乐部时，他也能理解一样。但却是他们那种更为疏远、更为复杂的欲望和心理历程令他困惑。他很快就意识到每个儿女的心思都是一座隐秘的迷宫，他永远也别指望踏进一步。他总是能碰上那堵将东西方分隔开来的墙。他无法走进他们的内心，同样，他知道自己的内心对他们来说也难以靠近。","So it was that Honolulu watched his wonderful family grow up into a perplexing problem and secretly sympathized with him, for it was beyond any of them to imagine what he was going to do with it.But Ah Chun saw the problem more clearly than they.No one knew as he knew the extent to which he was an alien in his family.His own family did not guess it.He saw that there was no place for him amongst this marvellous seed of his loins, and he looked forward to his declining years and knew that he would grow more and more alien.He did not understand his children.Their conversation was of things that did not interest him and about which he knew nothing.The culture of the West had passed him by.He was Asiatic to the last fibre, which meant that he was heathen.Their Christianity was to him so much nonsense.But all this he would have ignored as extraneous and irrelevant, could he have but understood the young people themselves.When Maud, for instance, told him that the housekeeping bills for the month were thirty thousand—that he understood, as he understood Albert’s request for five thousand with which to buy the schooner yacht Muriel and become a member of the Hawaiian Yacht Club.But it was their remoter, complicated desires and mental processes that obfuscated him.He was not slow in learning that the mind of each son and daughter was a secret labyrinth which he could never hope to tread.Always he came upon the wall that divides East from West.Their souls were inaccessible to him, and by the same token he knew that his soul was inaccessible to them."
"此外，随着年纪越来越大，他发现自己越来越想要回到自己的同类人中去。唐人街的难闻气味在他闻起来却很有风味。走过街道的时候，他会满足地深吸几口气，因为在他心里这气味将他带回了广东那充满生机和活力、狭窄而又弯曲的小弄堂里。他后悔在婚前为了取悦斯特拉·艾伦代尔而剪掉了辫子，他认真考虑过把头剃了重新再长出一条辫子来的可行性。高价请来的厨师为他烹制的美食，却不能像唐人街空气污浊的小餐馆里那怪异的食物一样满足他怀旧的味蕾。他家举办的奢华高雅的晚宴闻名当地，参加的都是美国和欧洲的精英们，男士、女士平等地坐在长桌边。女士们佩戴的珠宝首饰映衬着白皙的脖颈和玉臂在柔和的灯光下熠熠闪耀；男士们身着晚礼服，谈笑风生，所谈到的话题，说的俏皮话对阿春来说，没什么难理解的，却让他觉得无趣。与其主持这样的晚宴，他更加享受抽半小时烟并同两三个中国密友聊聊天。","Besides, as the years came upon him, he found himself harking back more and more to his own kind.The reeking smells of the Chinese quarter were spicy to him.He sniffed them with satisfaction as he passed along the street, for in his mind they carried him back to the narrow tortuous alleys of Canton swarming with life and movement.He regretted that he had cut off his queue to please Stella Allendale in the prenuptial days, and he seriously considered the advisability of shaving his crown and growing a new one.The dishes his highly paid chef concocted for him failed to tickle his reminiscent palate in the way that the weird messes did in the stuffy restaurant down in the Chinese quarter.He enjoyed vastly more a half-hour’s smoke and chat with two or three Chinese chums, than to preside at the lavish and elegant dinners for which his bungalow was famed, where the pick of the Americans and Europeans sat at the long table, men and women on equality, the women with jewels that blazed in the subdued light against white necks and arms, the men in evening dress, and all chattering and laughing over topics and witticisms that, while they were not exactly Greek to him, did not interest him nor entertain."
"但问题的产生并非仅仅因为他是个异族人并且愈加渴望回归他的中国美食。他的财富也是原因之一。他一直希望能安享平静的晚年生活。他一直努力工作。作为回报，他本应享有平静和安宁。但他知道，有了这万贯家财，平静安宁注定不属于他。已经有了一些迹象和兆头。他以前也见过类似的困扰。那是他的老雇主丹廷，他的孩子们借助正当的法律程序夺走了他的财产经营权，并使法庭指派监护人予以执行。阿春知道，并且非常清楚，如果丹廷只是个穷人，就会发现他能相当理智地处理好自己的事情。而老丹廷只有三个孩子和50万财产，而他，陈阿春，有十五个孩子和他自己才清楚数目的好几百万。","But it was not merely his alienness and his growing desire to return to his Chinese flesh-pots that constituted the problem.There was also his wealth.He had looked forward to a placid old age.He had worked hard.His reward should have been peace and repose.But he knew that with his immense fortune peace and repose could not possibly be his.Already there were signs and omens.He had seen similar troubles before.There was his old employer, Dantin, whose children had wrested from him, by due process of law, the management of his property, having the Court appoint guardians to administer it for him.Ah Chun knew, and knew thoroughly well, that had Dantin been a poor man, it would have been found that he could quite rationally manage his own affairs.And old Dantin had had only three children and half a million, while he, Chun Ah Chun, had fifteen children and no one but himself knew how many millions."
"“咱们的女儿们都是漂亮的姑娘。”一天晚上，他对妻子说，“有很多年轻的小伙子。咱们的房子里总是有很多年轻的小伙子。我的雪茄账单总是很高。怎么就没有要结婚的呢？”","“Our daughters are beautiful women,” he said to his wife, one evening.“There are many young men.The house is always full of young men.My cigar bills are very heavy.Why are there no marriages?”"
"阿春夫人耸耸肩等他往下说。","Mamma Achun shrugged her shoulders and waited."
"“这男是男，女是女的——奇怪的是却没有要结婚的。可能这些年轻小伙子不喜欢我们的女儿吧。”","“Women are women and men are men—it is strange there are no marriages.Perhaps the young men do not like our daughters.”"
"“啊，他们很喜欢我们的女儿们，”阿春夫人回答道，“但是你知道，他们无法忽略你是女儿们的父亲。”","“Ah, they like them well enough,” Mamma Chun answered; “but you see, they cannot forget that you are your daughters’ father.”"
"“但你就忽略了我父亲是谁，”阿春严肃认真地说，“你所要求的只是要我把辫子剪掉。”","“Yet you forgot who my father was,” Ah Chun said gravely.“All you asked was for me to cut off my queue.”"
"“我想，那些年轻人可比我挑剔多了。”","“The young men are more particular than I was, I fancy.”"
"“世界上最伟大的东西是什么？”阿春突然问了个毫不相干的问题。","“What is the greatest thing in the world?”Ah Chun demanded with abrupt irrelevance."
"阿春夫人想了一会儿，答道：“是上帝。”","Mamma Achun pondered for a moment, then replied: “God.”"
"他点头。“有各种各样的神明。有纸糊的，木头的，还有青铜的。我在办公室里还用了一个小的神像来镇纸。主教博物馆里有许多珊瑚岩和熔岩石做的神像。","He nodded.“There are gods and gods.Some are paper, some are wood, some are bronze.I use a small one in the office for a paper-weight.In the Bishop Museum are many gods of coral rock and lava stone.”"
"“但只有一个上帝，”她决然地宣称，挺直了丰满的身躯摆出要争论的架势。","“But there is only one God,” she announced decisively, stiffening her ample frame argumentatively."
"阿春注意到了这个危险信号，于是避开了。","Ah Chun noted the danger signal and sheered off."
"“那么，比上帝还伟大的是什么？”他问，“我来告诉你。是钱。我这一生和犹太教徒、基督徒、伊斯兰教徒和佛教徒都做过生意，也同来自所罗门、新几内亚的矮个子黑人打过交道，这些人将自己信奉的神明包在油纸里带在身边。他们信奉不同的神明，但这些人，他们都崇尚金钱。那个希金森上校。他好像喜欢亨里埃塔。”","“What is greater than God, then?” he asked.“I will tell you.It is money.In my time I have had dealings with Jews and Christians, Mohammedans and Buddhists, and with little black men from the Solomons and New Guinea who carried their god about them, wrapped in oiled paper.They possessed various gods, these men, but they all worshipped money.There is that Captain Higginson.He seems to like Henrietta.”"
"“他绝不会跟她结婚的，”阿春夫人反驳道，“他去世之前会升为海军上将的……”","“He will never marry her,” retorted Mamma Achun.“He will be an admiral before he dies—”"
"“是海军少将。”阿春插嘴道。","“A rear-admiral,” Ah Chun interpolated."
"“是，我知道。他们退役的时候都是那样的。”","“Yes, I know.That is the way they retire.”"
"“他的家族在美国地位很高。他们不会乐意的，如果他娶的是……如果他不娶一个美国女孩的话。”","“His family in the United States is a high one.They would not like it if he married...if he did not marry an American girl.”"
"阿春把烟斗里的烟灰磕出来，若有所思地往银烟斗里又装上一小撮烟草。在他开口讲话之前，他点着烟抽了一口。","Ah Chun knocked the ashes out of his pipe, thoughtfully refilling the silver bowl with a tiny pledget of tobacco.He lighted it and smoked it out before he spoke."
"“亨里埃塔是最大的女儿。她出嫁的那天，我会给她30万美元。这总能吸引那个希金森上校和他的上流家庭了吧。把这消息透漏给他。我把这件事交给你了。”","“Henrietta is the oldest girl.The day she marries I will give her three hundred thousand dollars.That will fetch that Captain Higginson and his high family along with him.Let the word go out to him.I leave it to you.”"
"阿春坐着继续抽烟，他看见盘旋环绕的烟圈中呈现出了陶淑仪的脸庞和身影——陶淑仪是负责伯父在广东农村家里所有事务的女仆，她的活永远也干不完，而辛劳一整年也只能得到一美元的薪水。然后，在盘旋的烟圈里，他也看到了年轻时候的自己，年轻时的自己曾在叔叔的田地里苦干了十八年，拿到的工资也只比乔淑仪多了一点点。然而现在他，阿春，一个农民，给自己女儿的嫁妆抵得上30万年如此的辛劳。而她只是12个女儿中的一个。想到这些他并不觉得高兴。他突然意识到这是一个滑稽又反复无常的世界，不由得大声笑了出来。这让正沉浸在遐想里的阿春夫人一惊，阿春知道夫人将这些遐想深藏在内心中隐秘的小室里，而他从未看透过。","And Ah Chun sat and smoked on, and in the curling smoke-wreaths he saw take shape the face and figure of Toy Shuey—Toy Shuey, the maid of all work in his uncle’s house in the Cantonese village, whose work was never done and who received for a whole year’s work one dollar.And he saw his youthful self arise in the curling smoke, his youthful self who had toiled eighteen years in his uncle’s field for little more.And now he, Ah Chun, the peasant, dowered his daughter with three hundred thousand years of such toil.And she was but one daughter of a dozen.He was not elated at the thought.It struck him that it was a funny, whimsical world, and he chuckled aloud and startled Mamma Achun from a revery which he knew lay deep in the hidden crypts of her being where he had never penetrated."
"但阿春的消息还是像秘闻一般传了出去，希金森上校把他的海军少将头衔和上流的家庭都抛在了脑后，连着30万美元的嫁妆迎娶了这个高雅又有教养的女孩，这个身上有着1/32波利尼西亚血统、1/16意大利血统、1/16葡萄牙血统、1/32英美血统，和1/2中国血统的姑娘。","But Ah Chun’s word went forth, as a whisper, and Captain Higginson forgot his rear-admiralship and his high family and took to wife three hundred thousand dollars and a refined and cultured girl who was one thirty-second Polynesian, one-sixteenth Italian, one-sixteenth Portuguese, eleven thirty-seconds English and Yankee, and one-half Chinese."
"阿春的慷慨大方起到了效果。他的女儿们立刻变得让人称心如意，极受欢迎。克拉拉是下一个，但当领土局部长正式向她求婚时，阿春告诉他必须得等轮到他才行。因为莫德是剩下的女儿中最大的，她必须先结婚。这是个精明的策略。全家人因此都非常热衷于把莫德嫁出去，三个月后，莫德嫁给了美国移民局专员内德·汉弗莱斯。但他和莫德都抱怨不已，因为嫁妆只有20万美元。阿春解释说一开始的慷慨大方是破冰之举，之后的女儿们能期望得到的只会越来越少。","Ah Chun’s munificence had its effect.His daughters became suddenly eligible and desirable.Clara was the next, but when the Secretary of the Territory formally proposed for her, Ah Chun informed him that he must wait his turn, that Maud was the oldest and that she must be married first.It was shrewd policy.The whole family was made vitally interested in marrying off Maud, which it did in three months, to Ned Humphreys, the United States immigration commissioner.Both he and Maud complained, for the dowry was only two hundred thousand.Ah Chun explained that his initial generosity had been to break the ice, and that after that his daughters could not expect otherwise than to go more cheaply."
"克拉拉在莫德之后结了婚，而且从那以后，每隔两年就有人结婚，平房里接连不断地举办了一轮婚礼。与此同时，阿春也并没有闲着。他一项接一项地收回投资。他将自己在二十个企业里的股份全部卖掉，并且一步步地，为了避免引起市场的暴跌，处理了他在房地产业的庞大持有额。到了最后，他的确使市场一下子陷入了萧条，于是便赔本出售。这样急切出手是因为他已经看到了地平线上正在聚集的风暴。到露西尔结婚的时候，争吵声和猜忌声已经开始在他耳边闹嚷嚷地回响。空气里充斥着各种阴谋以及应对的诡计，每个女婿都想讨好他，并离间他和其他某一个女婿的关系，或者干脆想办法让他对除了自己的其他女婿都产生偏见。这一切都对他之前计划好的平和安宁的晚年生活无益。","Clara followed Maud, and thereafter, for a space of two years; there was a continuous round of weddings in the bungalow.In the meantime Ah Chun had not been idle.Investment after investment was called in.He sold out his interests in a score of enterprises, and step by step, so as not to cause a slump in the market, he disposed of his large holdings in real estate.Toward the last he did precipitate a slump and sold at sacrifice.What caused this haste were the squalls he saw already rising above the horizon.By the time Lucille was married, echoes of bickerings and jealousies were already rumbling in his ears.The air was thick with schemes and counter-schemes to gain his favour and to prejudice him against one or another or all but one of his sons-in-law.All of which was not conducive to the peace and repose he had planned for his old age."
"他加紧了努力。他曾长时间与上海和澳门的主要银行保持通信联系。有几年，每艘轮船都在往外运送以陈阿春为受款人的汇票，以存入那些远东的银行。现在这些汇票更多了。他的两个最小的女儿还没有结婚。他没有等待，而是给了两个女儿每人10万美元的嫁妆，两笔钱都存在夏威夷银行里，会一直产生利息直到她们结婚的日子。艾伯特接手了阿春阿杨公司的生意，而长子哈罗德，则选择拿走25万去英国生活。最小的儿子查尔斯得到了10万美元、一名法定监护人和一个到基利协会戒酒的课程。阿春夫人得到了他们的平房，坦塔罗斯的山地住宅，还有一处新的海滨住宅代替以前卖给政府的那座。阿春还从那些良好的投资中拿出五十万来送给阿春夫人。","He hastened his efforts.For a long time he had been in correspondence with the chief banks in Shanghai and Macao.Every steamer for several years had carried away drafts drawn in favour of one, Chun Ah Chun, for deposit in those Far Eastern banks.The drafts now became heavier.His two youngest daughters were not yet married.He did not wait, but dowered them with a hundred thousand each, which sums lay in the Bank of Hawaii, drawing interest and awaiting their wedding day.Albert took over the business of the firm of Ah Chun and Ah Yung, Harold, the eldest, having elected to take a quarter of a million and go to England to live.Charles, the youngest, took a hundred thousand, a legal guardian, and a course in a Keeley institute.To Mamma Achun was given the bungalow, the mountain House on Tantalus, and a new seaside residence in place of the one Ah Chun sold to the government.Also, to Mamma Achun was given half a million in money well invested."
"阿春现在已经准备好要解决问题的核心部分了。一个晴朗的早晨，全家在一起吃早餐——他已经确保所有的女儿女婿都在场——他宣布他要重回故土。他以一番简短的说教解释道，他已经为全家做好了充裕的准备。他还制定了各种各样的行为准则，他说这些肯定能使全家安宁和睦地相处在一起。另外，他还给了女婿们一些经商方面的意见，宣扬有节制的生活和安全投资的优点，并把自己关于夏威夷工商业状况的广博知识传授给了他们。然后他叫来了自己的四轮马车，在泪流不止的阿春夫人的陪同下，驾车驶向了太平洋邮轮，留下了一屋子人在那里慌作一团。希金森上校狂暴地大嚷着要求实行禁令。女儿们都泪如泉涌。其中一个女婿是前联邦法官，他质疑阿春是不是神智清醒，立刻去找有关当局调查这个事情。他回来时带回了这样的消息：阿春前一天出现在委员会面前，要求参加测试，并以优异的成绩通过了测试。他们无计可施了，所以只能认输去跟这个小老头告别，阿春在轮船的散步甲板上挥手作别，大船穿行过珊瑚礁冲着大海驶去。","Ah Chun was now ready to crack the nut of the problem.One fine morning when the family was at breakfast—he had seen to it that all his sons-in-law and their wives were present—he announced that he was returning to his ancestral soil.In a neat little homily he explained that he had made ample provision for his family, and he laid down various maxims that he was sure, he said, would enable them to dwell together in peace and harmony.Also, he gave business advice to his sons-in-law, preached the virtues of temperate living and safe investments, and gave them the benefit of his encyclopedic knowledge of industrial and business conditions in Hawaii.Then he called for his carriage, and, in the company of the weeping Mamma Achun, was driven down to the Pacific Mail steamer, leaving behind him a panic in the bungalow.Captain Higginson clamoured wildly for an injunction.The daughters shed copious tears.One of their husbands, an ex-Federal judge, questioned Ah Chun’s sanity, and hastened to the proper authorities to inquire into it.He returned with the information that Ah Chun had appeared before the commission the day before, demanded an examination, and passed with flying colours.There was nothing to be done, so they went down and said good-bye to the little old man, who waved farewell from the promenade deck as the big steamer poked her nose seaward through the coral reef."
"但这个小老头并没有前往广东。他对自己的国家以及那些官吏的压榨行为太了解了，因而不会拿着剩下的这笔相当可观的财富去冒险。他去了澳门。现在的阿春已经长时间行使国王般的权力，所以也像国王一样专横。他在澳门登陆后，走进了最大的欧洲饭店的接待处注册入住，侍应生当着他的面合上了注册簿。禁止中国人入住。阿春要求见经理，却受到了无礼对待。他开车走了，但两个小时后他又回来了。他召来了侍应生和经理，给了他们一个月的薪水，然后解雇了他们。他让自己成为了这家饭店的老板，并在最豪华的套间里安顿了下来，一住就是好几个月，这期间他为自己在郊外修建了一所奢华的宅邸。同时，他凭借自己那老一套的经营才能使得这个大饭店的盈利从3％上升到了30％。","But the little old man was not bound for Canton.He knew his own country too well, and the squeeze of the Mandarins, to venture into it with the tidy bulk of wealth that remained to him.He went to Macao.Now Ah Chun had long exercised the power of a king and he was as imperious as a king.When he landed at Macao and went into the office of the biggest European hotel to register, the clerk closed the book on him.Chinese were not permitted.Ah Chun called for the manager and was treated with contumely.He drove away, but in two hours he was back again.He called the clerk and manager in, gave them a month’s salary, and discharged them.He had made himself the owner of the hotel; and in the finest suite he settled down during the many months the gorgeous palace in the suburbs was building for him.In the meantime, with the inevitable ability that was his, he increased the earnings of his big hotel from three per cent to thirty."
"阿春所逃避的麻烦事不久就发生了。有的女婿投资失败，其他的拿着阿春给女儿的嫁妆挥霍无度。阿春现在置身事外，他们盯上了阿春夫人和她那五十万，而且看着彼此的眼神也都不怀好意。律师们则在努力弄清信托书意义的过程中捞得油水。诉讼、交叉诉讼、反诉讼令夏威夷的法庭一片混乱嘈杂。治安法庭也未能幸免。愤怒的冲突中，大家开始恶言相向，甚至恶行相加。为了强调那些意味深长的言辞，诸如扔花瓶类的事件也时有发生。诽谤诉讼又起，使得他们一直不断地在法庭上周旋，也让火奴鲁鲁的岛民对目击者的内幕保持着强烈的兴趣。","The troubles Ah Chun had flown began early.There were sons-in-law that made bad investments, others that played ducks and drakes with the Achun dowries.Ah Chun being out of it, they looked at Mamma Ah Chun and her half million, and, looking, engendered not the best of feeling toward one another.Lawyers waxed fat in the striving to ascertain the construction of trust deeds.Suits, cross-suits, and counter-suits cluttered the Hawaiian courts.Nor did the police courts escape.There were angry encounters in which harsh words and harsher blows were struck.There were such things as flower pots being thrown to add emphasis to winged words.And suits for libel arose that dragged their way through the courts and kept Honolulu agog with excitement over the revelations of the witnesses."
"而在他的宅邸里，置身于东方可贵的愉悦之中，阿春平静地抽着烟袋，留意着大洋彼岸的混乱状况。每艘邮轮上都有一封阿春从澳门寄往火奴鲁鲁的信，信是用无可挑剔的英文写的，并用美国打字机打了出来。在信里，阿春以令人钦佩的正文和箴言建议全家要团结一致、和睦相处。至于他自己，他已远离了这一切，生活得心满意足。他赢得了安宁和平静。他不时搓搓手轻笑几声，一想起这个滑稽的世界，他那斜斜的小黑眼睛就会愉快地眨起来。因为在他的生活和理性思考中，有一点从没改变——他坚信这是个非常滑稽的世界。","In his palace, surrounded by all dear delights of the Orient, Ah Chun smokes his placid pipe and listens to the turmoil overseas.By each mail steamer, in faultless English, typewritten on an American machine, a letter goes from Macao to Honolulu, in which, by admirable texts and precepts, Ah Chun advises his family to live in unity and harmony.As for himself, he is out of it all, and well content.He has won to peace and repose.At times he chuckles and rubs his hands, and his slant little black eyes twinkle merrily at the thought of the funny world.For out of all his living and philosophizing, that remains to him—the conviction that it is a very funny world."
