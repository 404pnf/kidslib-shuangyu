" 一千美元","One Thousand Dollars"
"作者：欧亨利","by O. Henry"
"“一千美元，”托尔曼律师庄重而严肃地说，“在这儿。”","“One thousand dollars,” repeated Lawyer Tolman, solemnly and severely, “and here is the money.”"
"小吉利恩用指尖点着薄薄的一叠五十美元一张的新钞票，发出爽朗快活的笑声。","Young Gillian gave a decidedly amused laugh as he fingered the thin package of new fifty-dollar notes."
"“这是个多么令人尴尬的数目，”他友好地向律师解释道，“如果这是一万美元，一个人最终可能会得到一大堆烟花，为自己赢得赞誉。即使是五十美元，麻烦也会少一些。”","“It’s such a confoundedly awkward amount,” he explained, genially, to the lawyer.“If it had been ten thousand a fellow might wind up with a lot of fireworks and do himself credit.Even fifty dollars would have been less trouble.”"
"“你听到你叔叔遗嘱的宣读了，”托尔曼律师继续以专业口吻干巴巴地说，“我不清楚你是否注意到其中的细节。我必须提醒你一下。一旦你花掉这一千美元，按照规定，你要向我们提供这一千美元的消费清单。遗嘱明确要求了这一点。我相信到目前为止，你会遵从刚去世的吉利恩先生的遗愿。”","“You heard the reading of your uncle’s will,” continued Lawyer Tolman, professionally dry in his tones.“I do not know if you paid much attention to its details.I must remind you of one.You are required to render to us an account of the manner of expenditure of this $1,000 as soon as you have disposed of it.The will stipulates that.I trust that you will so far comply with the late Mr. Gillian’s wishes.”"
"“你大可放心，”年轻人有礼貌地说，“尽管会导致额外开支，我还是要雇一个秘书，我从来不擅长记账。”","“You may depend upon it,” said the young man politely, “in spite of the extra expense it will entail.I may have to engage a secretary.I was never good at accounts.”"
"吉利恩去他的俱乐部了。在那儿，他找到一个他称之为老布赖森的家伙。","Gillian went to his club.There he hunted out one whom he called Old Bryson."
"老布赖森是一个沉着冷静的人，四十岁，过着隐退生活。他正坐在一个角落里看一本书，当看到吉利恩走过来时，他叹了一口气，放下书，摘掉了眼镜。","Old Bryson was calm and forty and sequestered.He was in a corner reading a book, and when he saw Gillian approaching he sighed, laid down his book and took off his glasses."
"“老布赖森，振作点，”吉利恩说。“我有一件趣事要告诉你。”","“Old Bryson, wake up,” said Gillian.“I’ve a funny story to tell you.”"
"“我倒希望你能说给台球室的某个人听；”老布赖森说，“你知道我有多讨厌你那些事儿。”","“I wish you would tell it to some one in the billiard room,” said Old Bryson.“You know how I hate your stories.”"
"“这个比平常那些要好，”吉利恩说，卷了一根烟，“并且我很乐意告诉你。”这个故事和台球室的吵闹气氛混在一起太可悲、太滑稽了。我刚从我那过世的叔叔的合法海盗公司过来。他留给我整一千美元。现在，一个人有一千美元能做什么呢？”","“This is a better one than usual,” said Gillian, rolling a cigarette; “ and I’m glad to tell it to you.It’s too sad and funny to go with the rattling of billiard bars.I’ve just come from my late uncle’s firm of legal corsairs.He leaves me an even thousand dollars.Now, what can a man possibly do with a thousand dollars?”"
"“我认为，”老布赖森说，显示出蜜蜂在醋瓶里才有的浓厚兴趣，“刚去世的塞普蒂默斯·吉利恩差不多值一百万的一半。”","“I thought,” said Old Bryson, showing as much interest as a bee shows in a vinegar cruet, “that the late Septimus Gillian was worth something like half a million.”"
"“他是值那么多，”吉利恩饶高兴地赞同道，“这就是可笑的地方。他把所有的金币都留给了一种细菌。也就是说，一部分金币留给发现一种新细菌的人，剩余的用来创办一所医院，以便再消灭这种细菌。","“He was,” assented Gillian, joyously, “ and that’s where the joke comes in.He’s left his whole cargo of doubloons to a microbe.That is, part of it goes to the man who invents a new bacillus and the rest to establish a hospital for doing away with it again."
"还有一两笔微不足道的遗产——男管家和女管家各得到一枚图章戒指和十美元。他的侄子分到了一千美元。”","There are one or two trifling bequests on the side—the butler and the housekeeper get a seal ring and $10 each.His nephew gets $1,000.”"
"“你一直有足够的钱花。”老布赖森评论道。","“You’ve always had plenty of money to spend,” observed Old Bryson."
"“多得很。”吉利恩说道，“说到零用钱，叔叔可是充当孩童教母的仙女。”","“Tons,” said Gillian.“Uncle was the fairy god-mother as far as an allowance was concerned.”"
"“有其他继承人吗？”老布赖森问道。","“Any other heirs?”asked Old Bryson."
"“没有。”吉利恩对着他的烟皱了皱眉头，心神不宁地朝长沙发的皮套子上踢了一脚。","“None.” Gillian frowned at his cigarette and kicked the upholstered leather of a divan uneasily."
"有一位海登小姐，是我叔叔的监护对象，住在他家里。她是个安静的人——喜爱音乐——某个不幸的、不足以成为他朋友的人的女儿。我忘记说了，她也在分享图章戒指和十美元的玩笑之列。我希望我也是。然后我就可以在喝了两瓶酒后，把戒指当小费给服务员，并将整件事抛到一边去。别这么盛气凌人、傲慢无礼，老布赖森——告诉我一个人用一千美元可以做什么。”老布赖森擦了擦他的眼镜，笑了。当老布赖森笑的时候，吉利恩知道，他打算比以往更让人讨厌。","There is a Miss Hayden, a ward of my uncle, who lived in his house.She’s a quiet thing—musical—the daughter of somebody who was unlucky enough to be his friend.I forgot to say that she was in on the seal ring and $10 joke, too.I wish I had been.Then I could have had two bottles of brut, tipped the waiter with the ring and had the whole business off my bands.Don’t be superior and insulting, Old Bryson—tell me what a fellow can do with a thousand dollars.”Old Bryson rubbed his glasses and smiled.And when Old Bryson smiled, Gillian knew that he intended to be more offensive than ever."
"“一千美元，”他说，“很多也很少。一个人可以用它买一个幸福的家，并嘲笑一下洛克菲勒。另一个人可以用它把妻子送到南部，拯救她的生命。一千美元可以为一百个婴儿买纯牛奶，帮他们度过七、八、九月，并且能让其中五十个活下去。你可以用它在戒备森严的美术馆里消遣半小时，玩玩儿法罗牌。它还可以为一个有抱负的男孩提供受教育的机会。我被告知，昨天在拍卖行，一幅真的柯罗画的作保金额也是这个数目。用这笔钱，你可以搬到新罕布什尔的某个镇上，在那儿体面地住上两年。你可以用它租用麦迪逊广场花园一个晚上，如果你愿意演讲，可以针对假定继承人这一职业的不稳定性，对你的听众发表演说。”","“A thousand dollars,” he said, “means much or little.One man may buy a happy home with it and laugh at Rockefeller.Another could send his wife South with it and save her life.A thousand dollars would buy pure milk for one hundred babies during June, July, and August and save fifty of their lives.You could count upon a half hour’s diversion with it at faro in one of the fortified art galleries.It would furnish an education to an ambitious boy.I am told that a genuine Corot was secured for that amount in an auction room yesterday.You could move to a New Hampshire town and live respectably two years on it.You could rent Madison Square Garden for one evening with it, and lecture your audience, if you should have one, on the precariousness of the profession of heir presumptive.”"
"“人们也许会喜欢你，老布赖森，”吉利恩一直平静地说，“如果你不说教的话。我请你告诉我，用一千美元我可以做什么。”","“People might like you, Old Bryson,” said Gillian, always unruffled, “if you wouldn’t moralize.I asked you to tell me what I could do with a thousand dollars.”"
"“你？”布赖森说，脸上露出温柔的笑容，“哎呀，博比·吉利恩，你能做的事只有一件符合逻辑。你可以用这笔钱给洛塔·劳里埃小姐买个钻石吊坠，然后动身前往爱达荷，到一个牧场上去尝尝苦头。我建议去个牧羊场，因为我特别讨厌羊。”","“You?” said Bryson, with a gentle laugh.“Why, Bobby Gillian, there’s only one logical thing you could do.You can go buy Miss Lotta Lauriere a diamond pendant with the money, and then take yourself off to Idaho and inflict, your presence upon a ranch.I advise a sheep ranch, as I have a particular dislike for sheep.”"
"“谢谢了。”吉利恩站起身，“我想我可以依赖你，老布赖森。你想出了一个上好的计划。我想一次性把这笔钱花掉，因为我不得不上交一份账单，而我讨厌一条一条地登记。”","“Thanks,” said Gillian, rising, “I thought I could depend upon you, Old Bryson.You’ve hit on the very scheme.I wanted to chuck the money in a lump, for I’ve got to turn in an account for it, and I hate itemizing.”"
"吉利恩打电话叫了辆出租车，对司机说：“去哥伦拜恩剧院的舞台入口。”——洛塔·劳里埃小姐正在用粉扑搽脸，差不多已准备好登上拥挤的日场戏的舞台，这时，她的化妆师提到了吉利恩先生的名字。","Gillian phoned for a cab and said to the driver: “The stage entrance of the Columbine Theatre.”—Miss Lotta Lauriere was assisting nature with a powder puff, almost ready for her call at a crowded Matinee, when her dresser mentioned the name of Mr. Gillian."
"“让他进来。”洛塔·劳里埃小姐说，“嗨，有什么事，博比？两分钟后我就要登台了。”","“Let it in,” said Miss Lauriere.“Now, what is it, Bobby?I’m going on in two minutes.”"
"“给你的右耳加个小小的兔后足，”吉利恩建议道，带着鉴定的口吻，","“Rabbit-foot your right ear a little,” suggested Gillian, critically."
"“那样会更好，对我而言这用不了两分钟。你觉得在项链上加个小玩意儿怎么样？我能承受三位数前再加上一这个数。”","“That's better. It won’t take two minutes for me.What do you say to a little thing in the pendant line?I can stand three ciphers with a figure one in front of ‘em.”"
"“哦，就照你说的办吧。”劳里埃小姐高兴地说，“我的右手套，亚当斯。嘿，博比，你看到德拉·斯泰西那天晚上戴的项链了吗？那个在蒂芙尼珠宝店值两千两百美元。不过，当然——把我的腰带往左边拉一下，亚当斯。”","“Oh, just as you say,” carolled Miss Lauriere.“my right glove, Adams.Say, Bobby, did you see that necklace Della Stacey had on the other night?Twenty-two hundred dollars it cost at Tiffany’s.But, of course -pull my sash a little to the left, Adams.”"
"“劳里埃小姐登台，开幕的合唱曲开始！”报幕员在外面喊道。","“Miss Lauriere for the opening chorus!” cried the call boy without."
"吉利恩溜达出来，走向出租车等候的地方。","Gillian strolled out to where his cab was waiting."
"“如果你有一千美元，你会做什么？”吉利恩问司机。","“What would you do with a thousand dollars if you had it?” he asked the driver."
"“开一家沙龙。”司机立刻回答说，声音嘶哑。“我知道一个地方，我会用双手把钱投进去。那是一座四层砖楼，在一个拐角处。我已经盘算好了。二层——中国佬和炒杂碎；三层——修甲师和外国代表团；四层——台球室。如果你在考虑提供资金的话。”","“Open a s’loon,” said the cabby, promptly and huskily.“I know a place I could take money in with both hands.It’s a four-story brick on a corner.I’ve got it figured out.Second story—Chinese and chop suey; third floor—manicures and foreign missions; fourth floor—poolroom.If you was thinking of putting up the capital”"
"“噢，不。”吉利恩说，“我不过是出于好奇问一下。我按小时付费给你。一直开，直到我让你停下。”","“Oh, no,” said Gillian, “I merely asked from curiosity.I take you by the hour.Drive ’til I tell you to stop.”"
"车沿着百老汇驶过了八个街区，吉利恩用手杖敲了敲扶手，下了车。一个盲人坐在人行道旁的凳子上卖铅笔。吉利恩走过去，站在他的面前。","Eight blocks down Broadway Gillian poked up the trap with his cane and got out.A blind man sat upon a stool on the sidewalk selling pencils.Gillian went out and stood before him."
"“打扰一下，”他说，“不过你是否介意告诉我，如果你有一千美元你会做什么？”","“Excuse me,” he said, “ but would you mind telling me what you would do if you had a thousand dollars?”"
"“你从刚开过来的出租车上下来，是吗？”这位盲人问道。","“You got out of that cab that just drove up, didn’t you?” asked the blind man."
"“是的。”吉利恩说。","“I did,” said Gillian."
"“我猜你混得不错，”这个卖铅笔的人说，“大白天坐出租车。如果你愿意，看下这个。”","“I guess you are all right,” said the pencil dealer, “to ride in a cab by daylight.Take a look at that, if you like.”"
"他从大衣口袋里拿出一个小本递过来。吉利恩打开它，看到这是一本银行存折。上面显示余额是一千七百八十五美元，属于这位盲人。","He drew a small book from his coat pocket and held it out.Gillian opened it and saw that it was a bank deposit book.It showed a balance of $1,785 to the blind man’s credit."
"吉利恩归还了存折，坐上出租车。","Gillian returned the book and got into the cab."
"“我忘了一些事。”他说，“麻烦你开到托尔曼和夏普律师事务所，在——百老汇。”透过镶着金边的眼镜，托尔曼律师不友好地、好奇地看着他。","“I forgot something,” he said.“You may drive to the law offices of Tolman & Sharp, at—Broadway.”Lawyer Tolman looked at him hostilely and inquiringly through his gold-rimmed glasses."
"“请原谅，”吉利恩欢快地说，“不过我能问你一个问题吗？我希望这不是个无礼的问题。根据我叔叔的遗嘱，除了戒指和十美元，还有什么留给海登小姐吗？”","“I beg your pardon,” said Gillian, cheerfully, “but may I ask you a question?It is not an impertinent one, I hope.Was Miss Hayden left anything by my uncle’s will besides the ring and the $10?”"
"“什么也没有。”托尔曼先生说。","“Nothing,” said Mr. Tolman."
"“非常感谢你，先生。”吉利恩说，接着，他回到出租车那儿。把他过世的叔叔家的地址给了司机。","“I thank you very much, sir,” said Gillian, and on he went to his cab.He gave the driver the address of his late uncle’s home."
"海登小姐正在书房写信。她瘦小、苗条，穿着黑色的衣服。不过你会注意到她的眼睛。吉利恩带着一副愤世嫉俗的神情走了进来。","Miss Hayden was writing letters in the library.She was small and slender and clothed in black.But you would have noticed her eyes.Gillian drifted in with his air of regarding the world as inconsequent."
"“我刚从老托尔曼的事务所过来，”他解释道，“他们一直在那儿查看文件。他们找到一个，”——吉利恩绞尽脑汁，想找一个法律术语——“他们找到一个遗嘱的附加条款或补充说明之类的东西。好像是那个老家伙放松下来，重新考虑了一下，并遗赠给你一千美元。我正好坐车往这边来，托尔曼让我把钱带给你。钱在这儿。你最好数一下，看看数目是否正确。”","“I’ve just come from old Tolman’s,” he explained.“They’ve been going over the papers down there.They found a—Gillian searched his memory for a legal term—they found an amendment or a postscript or something to the will.It seemed that the old boy loosened up a little on second thoughts and willed you a thousand dollars.I was driving up this way and Tolman asked me to bring you the money.Here it is.You’d better count it to see if it’s right.”"
"吉利恩把钱放在她手边，桌子上。海登小姐脸色转白。","Gillian laid the money beside her hand on the desk.Miss Hayden turned white."
"“啊！”她又发出一声，“啊！”","“Oh! she said, and again “Oh!”"
"吉利恩侧转身，看着窗外。“我想，当然，”他低声说，“你知道我爱你。”","Gillian half turned and looked out the window.“I suppose, of course,”  he said, in a low voice, “that you know I love you.”"
"“对不起。”海登小姐说，把钱收了起来。","“I am sorry,” said Miss Hayden, taking up her money."
"“这于事无补吗？”吉利恩几乎漫不经心地问。“对不起。”她又说了一遍。","“There is no use?” asked Gillian, almost light-heartedly.“I am sorry,” she said again."
"“我可以写个便条吗？”吉利恩微笑着问。他在书房的大桌子旁坐下。她给他拿来纸和笔，然后回到自己的书桌旁。","“May I write a note?” asked Gillian, with a smile. He seated himself at the big library table.She supplied him with paper and pen, and then went back to her secretaire."
"吉利恩写下一千美元的开支清单，如下：","Gillian made out his account of his expenditure of the thousand dollars in these words:"
"“为了永远的幸福，由败家子罗伯特·吉利恩，将上帝所欠的一千美元交给世界上最美好、最可爱的女士。”","“Paid by the black sheep, Robert Gillian, $1,000 on account of the eternal happiness, owed by Heaven to the best and dearest woman on earth.”"
"吉利恩把便条塞进一个信封，鞠了一躬就离开了。","Gillian slipped his writing into an envelope, bowed and went his way."
"他坐的出租车再次停在托尔曼和夏普律师事务所前。","His cab stopped again at the offices of Tolman & Sharp."
"“我已经花了那一千美元。”他高兴地对戴着金眼镜的托尔曼说，“正如我所答应的，我来上交账单。空气中有一种夏天才有的感觉——你不这么认为吗，托尔曼先生？”他把一个白色信封扔在律师的桌上。“你会在里面找到一张便签，先生，它会说明这笔钱是怎么消失的。”","“I have expended the thousand dollars,” he said cheerily, to Tolman of the gold glasses, “ and I have come to render account of it, as I agreed.There is quite a feeling of summer in the air—do you not think so, Mr. Tolman?”He tossed a white envelope on the lawyer’s table.“You will find there a memorandum, sir, of the modus operandi of the vanishing of the dollars.”"
"托尔曼没有碰那个信封，他走进一扇门，去叫他的合伙人夏普。他们一起探查无比安全的洞穴。他们拖来一个蜡封的大信封，如同拖来一件他们搜寻到的战利品。他们用力打开信封，对着信的内容，一起摇晃着可敬的脑袋。然后托尔曼成了发言人。","Without touching the envelope, Mr. Tolman went to a door and called his partner, Sharp.Together they explored the caverns of an immense safe.Forth they dragged, as trophy of their search a big envelope sealed with wax.This they forcibly invaded, and wagged their venerable heads together over its contents.Then Tolman became spokesman."
"“吉利恩先生，”他郑重其事地说，“这儿有一份你叔叔遗嘱的附录。他私下把这个委托给我们，按照指示，直到你向我们提供一份你处理一千美元遗产的详细账单，才能把它打开。你履行了这些条件时，我和我的同伴才可以念这份遗嘱附录。我不希望里面的法律术语妨碍你的理解，不过我会让你了解它内容的宗旨。","“Mr. Gillian,” he said, formally, “there was a codicil to your uncle’s will.It was intrusted to us privately, with instructions that it be not opened until you had furnished us with a full account of your handling of the $1,000 bequest in the will.As you have fulfilled the conditions, my partner and I have read the codicil.I do not wish to encumber your understanding with its legal phraseology, but I will acquaint you with the spirit of its contents."
"倘若你对这一千美元的处置能显示出你具备任何一项值得奖励的资格，你将获得巨大好处。夏普先生和我被任命为裁定人，我向你保证，我们会根据公平、慷慨的原则，严格履行我们的职责。我们丝毫没有不利于你的倾向，吉利恩先生。不过让我们回到遗嘱附录上来。如果你对正谈论的这笔钱的处理是谨慎、明智、慷慨的，我们有权给你价值五万美元的债券，由于上述原因这些债券现在我们手上。不过，如果——正如我们的客户，已故的吉利恩先生，明确规定——你像过去花钱那样把这笔钱，我引用已故的吉利恩先生的话——用在应受斥责的挥霍上，和你的狐朋狗友一起——五万美元将交给米里亚姆·海登，已故吉利恩先生的被监护人，丝毫不能耽搁。现在，吉利恩先生，夏普先生和我将仔细审查你的一千美元的账单。我相信，你是以书面形式提交的。我希望你对我们的裁定有信心。”","In the event that your disposition of the $1,000 demonstrates that you possess any of the qualifications that deserve reward, much benefit will accrue to you.Mr. Sharp and I are named as the judges, and I assure you that we will do our duty strictly according to justice-with liberality.We are not at all unfavorably disposed toward you, Mr. Gillian.But let us return to the letter of the codicil.If your disposal of the money in question has been prudent, wise, or unselflish, it is in our power to hand you over bonds to the value of $50,000, which have been placed in our hands for that purpose.But if—as our client, the late Mr. Gillian, explicitly provides—you have used this money as you have money in the past, I quote the late Mr. Gillian—in reprehensible dissipation among disreputable associates—the $50,000 is to be paid to Miriam Hayden, ward of the late Mr. Gillian, without delay.Now, Mr. Gillian, Mr. Sharp and I will examine your account in regard to the $1,000.You submit it in writing, I believe.I hope you will repose confidence in our decision.”"
"托尔曼伸手去拿信封。吉利恩更快一点，拿起了信封。他不慌不忙地把清单和信封撕成长条，并把它们扔进衣袋。","Mr. Tolman reached for the envelope.Gillian was a little the quicker in taking it up.He tore the account and its cover leisurely into strips and dropped them into his pocket."
"“好了，”他笑着说，“根本没必要为这个打扰你们。不管怎样，我认为你们看不懂这些逐条记录的赌注。我在赛马比赛中输掉了那一千美元。祝你们今天心情愉快，先生们。”","“It’s all right,” he said, smilingly.“There isn’t a bit of need to bother you with this.I don’t suppose you’d understand these itemized bets, anyway.I lost the thousand dollars on the races.Good-day to you, gentlemen.”"
"吉利恩离开的时候，托尔曼和夏普相互看着，悲伤地摇着头，因为他们听到吉利恩在走廊里等电梯时，欢快地吹着口哨。","Tolman & Sharp shook their beads mournfully at each other when Gillian left, for they heard him whistling gayly in the hallway as he waited for the elevator."
