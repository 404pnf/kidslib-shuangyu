"强盗首领的故事","The Story of the Bandit Chieftain"
"作者：华盛顿·欧文","by Washington Irving"
"我是土生土长的普罗西蒂村人。父亲家境不错，一家人一起耕地，过着平静自足的生活。生活一直和和顺顺的，直到有一天，村里派来了一个新警官，接管了整个警局。他是个独断专行的家伙，什么事情都要管。在履行职责时，总是干些让人恼怒压抑的事。","I am a native of the village of Prossedi.My father was easy enough in circumstances, and we lived peaceably and independently, cultivating our fields.All went on well with us until a new chief of the sbirri was sent to our village to take command of the police.He was an arbitrary fellow, prying into every thing, and practising all sorts of vexations and oppressions in the discharge of his office."
"当时我十八岁，生来就热爱正义，热爱邻里乡亲。我还受过点儿教育，懂点历史，所以对人和事也能判断个一二。种种这些，都让我对这个卑鄙的恶霸憎恨无比。我家也成为他怀疑与厌恶的对象，并且不止一次觉察到他滥用职权。所有这些都在我心中蓄积起来，我想要报仇。我一向性格刚烈，精力旺盛，又爱维护正义，所以我决心整治他一下，使我们村子摆脱这个恶霸。","I was at that time eighteen years of age, and had a natural love of justice and good neighborhood.I had also a little education, and knew something of history, so as to be able to judge a little of men and their actions.All this inspired me with hatred for this paltry despot.My own family, also, became the object of his suspicion or dislike, and felt more than once the arbitrary abuse of his power.These things worked together on my mind, and I gasped after vengeance.My character was always ardent and energetic; and acted upon by my love of justice, determined me by one blow to rid the country of the tyrant."
"准备充分后，一天早晨天还没亮，我就起床了，我在马甲下面藏了一把匕首——你看，就是它！（他拿出了一把锋利的长匕首）——我就藏在村外等他。我知道他常出没的地方，而且我还知道他习惯于一大早像狼一样悄悄地四处巡视一番。终于，我碰到了他，愤怒地扑上去。虽然他带着武器，但是我攻其不备，再加上我年轻力壮。我一个劲地揍他，直到确信可以了，才让他一动不动地倒在我的脚下。","Full of my project I rose one morning before peep of day, and concealing a stiletto under my waistcoat—here you see it!—(and he drew forth a long keen poniard)—I lay in wait for him in the outskirts of the village.I knew all his haunts, and his habit of making his rounds and prowling about like a wolf, in the gray of the morning; at length I met him, and attacked him with fury.He was armed, but I took him unawares, and was full of youth and vigor.I gave him repeated blows to make sure work, and laid him lifeless at my feet."
"干掉他之后，我很满意，然后急急忙忙地就往村里赶。但倒霉的是，进村的时候，我正好碰到了他两个手下。他们跟我打招呼，问我有没有看见他们的头头。我装出镇静的样子，告诉他们我没看见。他们继续往前走。几个小时后，他们就抬着他们头头的尸体回到了普罗西蒂村。他们已经怀疑是我干的，我被逮捕了，还给关进了监狱。我在监狱里呆了几个星期之后，那个公爵，就是普罗西蒂的庄园主，起诉了我。我被带去审判。他们捏造了一个证人，说看见我在血淋淋的尸体附近，还仓皇逃脱。就这样，我被判了三十年苦役。","When I was satisfied that I had done for him, I returned with all haste to the village, but had the ill-luck to meet two of the sbirri as I entered it.They accosted me and asked if I had seen their chief.I assumed an air of tranquillity, and told them I had not.They continued on their way, and, within a few hours, brought back the dead body to Prossedi.Their suspicions of me being already awakened, I was arrested and thrown into prison.Here I lay several weeks, when the prince, who was Seigneur of Prossedi, directed judicial proceedings against me.I was brought to trial, and a witness was produced who pretended to have seen me not far from the bleeding body, and flying with precipitation, so I was condemned to the galleys for thirty years."
"“这该死的法律！”强盗大声喊道，气得唾沫横飞，“这该死的政府！还有那该千刀万剐的公爵！他让我被判重刑！而其他罗马公爵，对那些罪行比我大千倍的凶手还袒护包庇呢！我这么做还不是因为热爱正义，热爱乡亲们吗？布鲁特斯也是为了自由和正义的事业，杀死了凯撒大帝，为什么我的行为就比布鲁特斯更严重呢？”","“Curse on such laws,” vociferated the bandit, foaming with rage; “curse on such a government, and ten thousand curses on the prince who caused me to be adjudged so rigorously, while so many other Roman princes harbor and protect assassins a thousand times more culpable.What had I done but what was inspired by a love of justice and my country?Why was my act more culpable than that of Brutus, when he sacrificed Caesar to the cause of liberty and justice?”"
"这个强盗首领，居然口吐狂言，还把自己跟古代的大人物相提并论，这既有高尚的一面，又有可笑之处。不过，这说明他至少还有优点，即了解自己国家的一些历史大事。他平静了一些后，又继续讲他的故事。","There was something at once both lofty and ludicrous in the rhapsody of this robber chief, thus associating himself with one of the great names of antiquity.It showed, however, that he had at least the merit of knowing the remarkable facts in the history of his country.He became more calm, and resumed his narrative."
"我戴着镣铐，被送到了奇维塔韦基亚。我满腔怒火。我六个月前才跟心爱的女人结婚，而且她已怀有身孕。我们全家都陷入了绝望。很长一段时间，我多次试图弄断锁链，但都没成功。最后我找到了一小块铁片，小心翼翼地藏好后，努力用一块尖利的打火石把铁片磨得像锉刀一样。晚上我就忙着干这件事了，磨成以后，我又花了好长时间，才把铁链上的一个扣环给割断了。我成功越狱。","I was conducted to Civita Vecchia in fetters.My heart was burning with rage.I had been married scarce six months to a woman whom I passionately loved, and who was pregnant.My family was in despair.For a long time I made unsuccessful efforts to break my chain.At length I found a morsel of iron which I hid carefully, endeavored with a pointed flint to fashion it into a kind of file.I occupied myself in this work during the night-time, and when it was finished, I made out, after a long time, to sever one of the rings of my chain.My flight was successful."
"我在普罗西蒂周围的山中转了几个星期，设法将我的藏身之处告诉了妻子。她经常来看我。我决心要组织一支自己的武装队伍。她花了很长时间说服我放弃这个想法，但看到我已经下定决心，她最终还是跟我联合起来，参与到我的复仇计划中，并亲自拿来了我的匕首。","I wandered for several weeks in the mountains which surround Prossedi, and found means to inform my wife of the place where I was concealed.She came often to see me.I had determined to put myself at the head of an armed band.She endeavored for a long time to dissuade me; but finding my resolution fixed, she at length united in my project of vengeance, and brought me, herself, my poniard."
"通过她，我跟周围村落里几个勇敢的伙伴取得了联络。我知道他们早已有上山的打算，一直以来都在等待着这么一个机会，好展现自己的勇敢。很快，我们就组成了一个团体，搞到了武器，并有大量机会为我们当中大多数曾遭受不公和伤害的人报仇了。原本一切都进展得非常顺利，如果不是错把你当成公爵，我们现在早就赚了一笔钱了。","By her means I communicated with several brave fellows of the Neighboring villages, who I knew to be ready to take to the mountains, and only panting for an opportunity to exercise their daring spirits.We soon formed a combination, procured arms, and we have had ample opportunities of revenging ourselves for the wrongs and injuries which most of us have suffered.Every thing has succeeded with us until now, and had it not been for our blunder in mistaking you for the prince, our fortunes would have been made."
"强盗就这样讲完了自己的故事。他就像对待朋友一样和我说话，还一再让我放心，说不会再因为我无心导致的错误而怨恨我了。他甚至公开向我表示友好，希望我留下来跟他们呆一段时间。他承诺要让我去看他们在维勒特那边所占领的山洞，那是他们每次远征间歇休息的地方。他让我相信，他们在那里快活得很，每天有大量的好酒好菜，睡苔藓床，还有年轻美丽的女子服侍，我可以把她们当成画画的模特。","Here the robber concluded his story.He had talked himself into companionship, and assured me he no longer bore me any grudge for the error of which I had been the innocent cause.He even professed a kindness for me, and wished me to remain some time with them.He promised to give me a sight of certain grottos which they occupied beyond Villetri, and whither they resorted during the intervals of their expeditions.He assured me that they led a jovial life there; had plenty of good cheer; slept on beds of moss, and were waited upon by young and beautiful females, whom I might take for models."
"我承认，他对这些洞穴和洞穴里的居民的描述引起了我的好奇心。以前我一直以为，这样的生活只是幻想造出来的，而他们已把强盗故事中的生活变成了现实。如果跟他们在一起感觉更安全的话，我本应该欣然接受他的邀请，去参观那些洞穴。","I confess I felt my curiosity roused by his descriptions of these grottos and their inhabitants; they realized those scenes in robber-story which I had always looked upon as mere creations of the fancy.I should gladly have accepted his invitation, and paid a visit to those caverns, could I have felt more secure in my company."
"我开始觉得自己的处境没那么悲惨了。显而易见，我已经博得了强盗首领的好感。我希望他拿到适当的赎金后就把我放了。但是，新的危机正等着我呢。","I began to find my situation less painful.I had evidently propitiated the good-will of the chieftain, and hoped that he might release me for a moderate ransom.A new alarm, however, awaited me."
"正当强盗首领焦急地等待着派往公爵那儿的信使回来的时候，那个在拉莫拉洛平原的大山边上对面望哨的人匆忙朝我们跑来。“我们被出卖了！”他大声喊道，“弗拉斯卡蒂的警察来抓我们了。一队马枪骑兵刚刚停在山脚下的旅馆里。”接着他手里拿着匕首，恶狠狠地诅咒发誓说，如果他们向这山进犯一步，他就让我和我的那些同俘的伙伴命丧黄泉。","While the captain was looking out with impatience for the return of the messenger who had been sent to the prince, the sentinel who had been posted on the side of the mountain facing the plain of la Molara, came running towards us with precipitation.“We are betrayed!” exclaimed he.“The police of Frescati are after us.A party of carabiniers have just stopped at the inn below the mountain.”Then laying his hand on his stiletto, he swore, with a terrible oath, that if they made the least movement towards the mountains, my life and the lives of my fellow-prisoners should answer for it."
"强盗首领又恢复了那副凶残狠毒的模样，赞同他伙伴说的话。可是他的伙伴一回到哨位上，他就用柔和的语气对我说：“我必须表现得像个首领的样子，给我那些危险的部下做个样子。我们的原则是宁可杀死我们的俘虏，也决不让他们获救，不过不用惊慌。万一我们遭到突然袭击，你就跟我们一起逃，我会保证你的生命安全的。”","The chieftain resumed all his ferocity of demeanor, and approved of what his companion said; but when the latter had returned to his post, he turned to me with a softened air: “I must act as chief,” said he, “and humor my dangerous subalterns.It is a law with us to kill our prisoners rather than suffer them to be rescued; but do not be alarmed.In case we are surprised keep by me; fly with us, and I will consider myself responsible for your life.”"
"这样的安排没带给我丝毫安慰，却使我陷于双重危险之中。如果逃跑的话，我根本不知道哪种危险更叫人担忧，是追捕者的卡宾枪还是被追者的匕首。不过，我还是继续保持沉默，努力装出一副镇静的样子。","There was nothing very consolatory in this arrangement, which would have placed me between two dangers; I scarcely knew, in case of flight, which I should have most to apprehend from, the carbines of the pursuers, or the stilettos of the pursued.I remained silent, however, and endeavored to maintain a look of tranquillity."
"我就这样惴惴不安地过了一小时。强盗们蹲伏在树叶茂密的隐蔽处，警惕地注视着山下骑兵的一举一动：他们在旅馆周围闲逛，有时懒洋洋地靠着门口，有时消失几分钟，继而准备出发了。他们检查检查武器，指指不同的方向，显然是在询问附近的情况——这一举一动都没逃过强盗们敏锐的目光。最后，我们终于不再担忧了。那些骑兵吃完点心，拿起武器，沿着山谷向大路方向出发了，离我们的山头越来越远。“我确定，”强盗首领说，“他们不是派来追捕我们的。他们非常清楚在类似情况下我们是如何处理俘虏的。在这一点上，我们的原则没有任何商量余地，为了保证我们的安全，这是非常必要的。如果我们在他们面前让步一次，那么以后就再也甭想得到赎金之类的东西了。”","For an hour was I kept in this state of peril and anxiety.The robbers, crouching among their leafy coverts, kept an eagle watch upon the carabiniers below, as they loitered about the inn; sometimes lolling about the portal; sometimes disappearing for several minutes, then sallying out, examining their weapons, pointing in different directions and apparently asking questions about the neighborhood; not a movement or gesture was last upon the keen eyes of the brigands.At length we were relieved from our apprehensions.The carabiniers having finished their refreshment, seized their arms, continued along the valley towards the great road, and gradually left the mountain behind them.“I felt almost certain,” said the chief, “that they could not be sent after us.They know too well how prisoners have fared in our hands on similar occasions.Our laws in this respect are inflexible, and are necessary for our safety.If we once flinched from them, there would no longer be such thing as a ransom to be procured.”"
"仍然没有那个信使归来的迹象。当我准备重新画画时，强盗首领从他的背包中抽出一叠纸来——“给，”他笑着说，“你是个画家，给我画张像。你画夹里的纸太小了，在这张纸上给我画。”我高兴地答应了，因为对一个画家来说，这样的机会是很难得的。我想起了画家萨尔瓦托·罗萨年轻的时候，曾主动要求跟卡拉布里亚区的匪徒们呆一段时间，脑子装满了周围荒凉的景色和野蛮的朋友。想到这里，我兴致勃勃地拿起了铅笔。我发现那位强盗首领真是个最温顺的模特，叫他换了各种姿势后，让他摆出了一个符合我心意的姿势。","There were no signs yet of the messenger’s return.I was preparing to resume my sketching, when the captain drew a quire of paper from his knapsack—“Come,” said he, laughing, “you are a painter; take my likeness.The leaves of your portfolio are small; draw it on this.”I gladly consented, for it was a study that seldom presents itself to a painter.I recollected that Salvator Rosa in his youth had voluntarily sojourned for a time among the banditti of Calabria, and had filled his mind with the savage scenery and savage associates by which he was surrounded.I seized my pencil with enthusiasm at the thought.I found the captain the most docile of subjects, and after various shifting of positions, I placed him in an attitude to my mind."
"你自己想象一下，一个严肃的、强壮的汉子在你面前：一身奇异的强盗装束，腰上别着手枪和匕首，脖子露出结实的肌肉，上面松松地系着一条围巾，两端用从旅客那里抢来的各式各样的戒指耳环扣在前面，胸前挂着勋章和纪念品，帽子上装饰着五颜六色的丝带，身上穿着鲜艳的带有漂亮刺绣的背心和短马裤，脚蹬高筒靴或者系着绑腿。且想想，他立于高山之巅，周围是一片巉岩和粗壮的橡树，身子倚着他的卡宾枪，仿佛要策划什么惊人之举，下面远处是村落和别墅，辽阔的坎帕尼亚大平原隐隐延伸至远方，那是他可去掠夺的场所。","Picture to yourself a stern, muscular figure, in fanciful bandit costume, with pistols and poniards in belt, his brawny neck bare, a handkerchief loosely thrown around it, and the two ends in front strung with rings of all kinds, the spoils of travellers; reliques and medals hung on his breast; his hat decorated with various-colored ribbands; his vest and short breeches of bright colors and finely embroidered; his legs in buskins or leggins.Fancy him on a mountain height, among wild rocks and rugged oaks, leaning on his carbine as if meditating some exploit, while far below are beheld villages and villas, the scenes of his maraudings, with the wide Campagna dimly extending in the distance."
"强盗首领对这幅素描很满意，似乎很欣赏画中的自己。我刚刚画完，那个被派去索要赎金的信使就回来了。他凌晨两点才到达土斯库鲁。那时，那个公爵正躺在床上睡觉呢。他给我捎回一封公爵给我的信。正如我所预料，他认为要价太高了，只肯出五百美元作为我的赎金。因为他当时身上没有现金，就写了一个凭条，凭借这个凭条，他将付款给任何一个可以将我安全送到罗马的人。我把凭条给强盗首领看，他耸耸肩膀接了过去。“凭条对我们有什么用呢？”他说，“我们能派谁把你送到罗马取钱呢？我们都是通缉犯，从城门口到每个军事哨所，再到村里教堂的门口，所有的人都认识我们，都描述得出我们的样貌。不行，我们只要黄金白银；等我们拿到现金，你才会恢复自由。”","The robber was pleased with the sketch, and seemed to admire himself upon paper.I had scarcely finished, when the laborer arrived who had been sent for my ransom.He had reached Tusculum two hours after midnight.He brought me a letter from the prince, who was in bed at the time of his arrival.As I had predicted, he treated the demand as extravagant, but offered five hundred dollars for my ransom.Having no money by him at the moment, he had sent a note for the amount, payable to whomever should conduct me safe and sound to Rome.I presented the note of hand to the chieftain; he received it with a shrug.“Of what use are notes of hand to us?” said he, “who can we send with you to Rome to receive it?We are all marked men, known and described at every gate and military post, and village church-door.No, we must have gold and silver; let the sum be paid in cash and you shall be restored to liberty.”"
"强盗首领又把一张纸铺在我面前，让我给公爵回信，表明他的决心。待我写好信，把纸从那一叠纸上撕下时，我发现这张纸的反面粘着我刚才画的那副画。我正要把它撕下来交给强盗首领。","The captain again placed a sheet of paper before me to communicate his determination to the prince.When I had finished the letter and took the sheet from the quire, I found on the opposite side of it the portrait which I had just been tracing.I was about to tear it off and give it to the chief."
"“慢着，”他说，“把它一起送到罗马去吧，让他们看看我长什么样。或许公爵和他的朋友会像你一样，看到我的面相，对我有好印象呢。”","“Hold,” said he, “let it go to Rome; let them see what kind of looking fellow I am.Perhaps the prince and his friends may form as good an opinion of me from my face as you have done.”"
"这是句玩笑话，但他爱慕虚荣之心却昭然若揭。这个小心翼翼、疑心重重的强盗首领居然也会因为像大家一样想得到赞美，一时忘了自己通常的那种深谋远虑和小心谨慎。他根本没有想到这幅肖像画会在追捕他以及给他定罪时会派上什么用场。","This was said sportively, yet it was evident there was vanity lurking at the bottom.Even this wary, distrustful chief of banditti forgot for a moment his usual foresight and precaution in the common wish to be admired.He never reflected what use might be made of this portrait in his pursuit and conviction."
"信封好后就发出，信使又踏上了前往土斯库鲁的路。现在是上午十一点，而我们还什么都没有吃。虽然我很担心，但也感到饥肠辘辘了。所以，当听到强盗首领说要吃点什么的时候，我心里很高兴。他这才意识到他们已经在岩石和树丛中潜伏了三天三夜，就在他们一直策划着要向土斯库鲁进发的期间，已经耗尽了所有的粮食储备。他现在应该设法搞点吃的才行。因此，他将我交给那个他显然很信任的伙伴后，就离开了，临走前还给我保证说，不到两个小时我们就可以吃顿大餐了。尽管他们在这些村庄里明显有一些秘密朋友和间谍，但食物从何而来对我来说仍是个谜。","The letter was folded and directed, and the messenger departed again for Tusculum.It was now eleven o’clock in the morning, and as yet we had eaten nothing.In spite of all my anxiety, I began to feel a craving appetite.I was glad, therefore, to hear the captain talk something of eating.He observed that for three days and nights they had been lurking about among rocks and woods, meditating their expedition to Tusculum, during which all their provisions had been exhausted.He should now take measures to procure a supply.Leaving me, therefore, in the charge of his comrade, in whom he appeared to have implicit confidence, he departed, assuring me, that in less than two hours we should make a good dinner.Where it was to come from was an enigma to me, though it was evident these beings had their secret friends and agents throughout the country."
"事实上，那些环绕在山谷里的居民处于一种粗俗、半文明状态。阿布鲁奇森林中的小镇和村庄，与外界隔绝，几乎像是尚未开化的洞穴。这些鲜为人知、无人问津的原始住所，居然位于旅客访问人数最多、文明程度最高的一个欧洲国家里，真是不可思议。在这些地区中，强盗们潜伏起来，不受打扰；山民们毫不犹豫地给强盗提供避难场所和帮助。而山上的牧羊人则是强盗们最喜欢的信使，他们可以把索要赎金或者供给的消息带下山谷去。阿布鲁奇山上的牧羊人跟他们经常去的地方的景色一样粗野。他们身穿黑色或棕色的粗糙的羊皮外衣，头戴圆锥形高帽，脚蹬简陋的布鞋，并用皮条缠在腿上，跟强盗们穿的一个样。他们随身带着长棍，当身子斜靠在上面的时候，便成了周围孤寂的景色中一个别致的部分。他们身后总是跟着他们忠实的伙伴——牧羊犬。这些牧羊人都好奇而多疑，随时都很乐意和过路人聊上几句，以排遣自己的空虚寂寞。这个时候，牧羊犬也会聚精会神地竖起耳朵，像它的主人一样，显得很聪明，什么都想要追根究底弄明白似的。","Indeed, the inhabitants of these mountains and of the valleys which they embosom are a rude, half civilized set.The towns and villages among the forests of the Abruzzi, shut up from the rest of the world, are almost like savage dens.It is wonderful that such rude abodes, so little known and visited, should be embosomed in the midst of one of the most travelled and civilized countries of Europe.Among these regions the robber prowls unmolested; not a mountaineer hesitates to give him secret harbor and assistance.The shepherds, however, who tend their flocks among the mountains, are the favorite emissaries of the robbers, when they would send messages down to the valleys either for ransom or supplies.The shepherds of the Abruzzi are as wild as the scenes they frequent.They are clad in a rude garb of black or brown sheep-skin; they have high conical hats, and coarse sandals of cloth bound round their legs with thongs, similar to those worn by the robbers.They carry long staffs, on which as they lean they form picturesque objects in the lonely landscape, and they are followed by their ever-constant companion, the dog.They are a curious, questioning set, glad at any time to relieve the monotony of their solitude by the conversation of the passerby, and the dog will lend an attentive ear, and put on as sagacious and inquisitive a look as his master."
"我刚刚跑题了。现在，我独自一人跟一个强盗呆在一起，他是强盗首领的心腹。他是这伙强盗中最年轻、最有活力的一个，表情也有种放纵的凶残，似乎跟这种无法无天的生活方式非常吻合，可是依旧可以看出他的阳刚之美。身为画家的我不禁欣赏起来。我发觉他心不在焉，时不时显露出内心的折磨和焦躁。这会儿他正坐在地上，两肘支在膝盖上，头埋在紧握的两个拳头之间，两眼盯着地面，沉思中流露着悲伤与痛苦的表情。我和他交谈几句之后，渐渐熟悉起来，并发现他的思想比其他的强盗更加深刻。我迫切地抓住一切机会，以走近他的内心世界。我觉得我在这张脸上觉察到了他内心的懊悔与自责。我轻易博得了强盗首领的信任，这让我期望着也能博得他的手下的信任。","But I am wandering from my story.I was now left alone with one of the robbers, the confidential companion of the chief.He was the youngest and most vigorous of the band, and though his countenance had something of that dissolute fierceness which seems natural to this desperate, lawless mode of life, yet there were traits of manly beauty about it.As an artist I could not but admire it.I had remarked in him an air of abstraction and reverie, and at times a movement of inward suffering and impatience.He now sat on the ground; his elbows on his knees, his head resting between his clenched fists, and his eyes fixed on the earth with an expression of sad and bitter rumination.I had grown familiar with him from repeated conversations, and had found him superior in mind to the rest of the band.I was anxious to seize every opportunity of sounding the feelings of these singular beings.I fancied I read in the countenance of this one traces of self-condemnation and remorse; and the ease with which I had drawn forth the confidence of the chieftain encouraged me to hope the same with his followers."
"寒暄过后，我大胆地问他有没有因为抛弃家人、从事这么危险的行业而后悔过。“我这辈子，”他回答道，“只后悔一件事。”说着，他将紧握的拳头压在胸口，咬紧牙关吸了口气，然后动情地接着说道：“有件事让我无法释怀，就像块炙铁一样一直灼烧着我的心。我可以告诉你一个悲惨的故事，但不是现在——下次再说吧。”——他又恢复了原先的姿势，双手托头坐在那里，有时会突然间喃喃自语，像是在恶言咒骂着什么。我觉得他不想被打扰，所以就让他一个人呆着了。没多久，他好像是想累了，或是远征太疲惫了，就开始打瞌睡。他挣扎了一会，但中午又暖又闷，让人无法抵抗睡意，他终于还是躺在草丛上睡着了。","After a little preliminary conversation, I ventured to ask him if he did not feel regret at having abandoned his family and taken to this dangerous profession.“I feel,” replied he, “but one regret, and that will end only with my life;” as he said this he pressed his clenched fists upon his bosom, drew his breath through his set teeth, and added with deep emotion, “I have something within here that stifles me; it is like a burning iron consuming my very heart.I could tell you a miserable story, but not now—another time.”—He relapsed into his former position, and sat with his head between his hands, muttering to himself in broken ejaculations, and what appeared at times to be curses and maledictions.I saw he was not in a mood to be disturbed, so I left him to himself.In a little time the exhaustion of his feelings, and probably the fatigues he had undergone in this expedition, began to produce drowsiness.He struggled with it for a time, but the warmth and sultriness of mid-day made it irresistible, and he at length stretched himself upon the herbage and fell asleep."
"现在，我看到逃跑的机会唾手可得。看守我的人在我面前躺着，任由我摆布。他强壮有力的四肢放松下来，胸部敞开任由人击打，卡宾枪已从无力的手中滑落，掉在他身边，那把经常随身携带的匕首一半都露在了口袋外面。但是眼下还可以看到他的两个伙伴，他们在很远的山边，背对着我们，全神贯注地望着平原。透过一排介在中间的树林，在一个陡峭的山坡脚下，我看到了罗卡皮耶托雷村庄。我可以在一转眼的时间就把那个睡着的强盗的卡宾枪弄到手，拿起他的匕首刺进他的心脏。如果他悄无声息地死去，我就可以在被发现之前，快速冲过树林，直奔下面罗卡皮耶托雷村庄。即使被他们发现，等发出警报时，我也应该远比强盗们占先，可能已溜出他们的射程之外了。","I now beheld a chance of escape within my reach.My guard lay before me at my mercy.His vigorous limbs relaxed by sleep; his bosom open for the blow; his carbine slipped from his nerveless grasp, and lying by his side; his stiletto half out of the pocket in which it was usually carried.But two of his comrades were in sight, and those at a considerable distance, on the edge of the mountain; their backs turned to us, and their attention occupied in keeping a look-out upon the plain.Through a strip of intervening forest, and at the foot of a steep descent, I beheld the village of Rocca Priori.To have secured the carbine of the sleeping brigand, to have seized upon his poniard and have plunged it in his heart, would have been the work of an instant.Should he die without noise, I might dart through the forest and down to Rocca Priori before my flight might be discovered.In case of alarm, I should still have a fair start of the robbers, and a chance of getting beyond the reach of their shot."
"眼下，我既可以逃跑又能报仇，虽然危险，却有很强的诱惑力。如果处境更危险一些，我会毫不犹豫地付诸行动。但我还是思忖了一番。如果我的企图成功的话，我的两个同伴肯定会命丧黄泉，因为他们这会睡得正香，把他们立马叫醒逃跑是来不及的。那个去索要赎金的信使也可能会在强盗盛怒之下成为牺牲品，因为他带来的钱也打水漂了。此外，强盗首领待我还好，这使我确信他应该很快就会把我释放。在这些考虑打消了我最初的强烈冲动后，我内心的波澜平静下来了。","Here then was an opportunity for both escape and vengeance; perilous, indeed, but powerfully tempting.Had my situation been more critical I could not have resisted it.I reflected, however, for a moment.The attempt, if successful, would be followed by the sacrifice of my two fellow prisoners, who were sleeping profoundly, and could not be awakened in time to escape.The laborer who had gone after the ransom might also fall a victim to the rage of the robbers, without the money which he brought being saved.Besides, the conduct of the chief towards me made me feel certain of speedy deliverance.These reflections overcame the first powerful impulse, and I calmed the turbulent agitation which it had awakened."
"我便又拿出画画的工具，陶醉在壮丽的景色中。现在正值晌午，万物都处于沉寂中，就像在我面前睡着的强盗一样。中午时分，群山之间，万物寂静。下面是辽阔的平原，远处的城镇若隐若现，间或有各式各样的住宅，显露出生活的迹象，但一切都那么安静，我被眼前这景色深深触动了。就连群山中间的山谷也有一种独特的幽静气氛。中午时分，周围安静极了，很少有声音打破这份沉静。有时会听到孤独的赶骡人的口哨声，赶骡人和他那一群慵懒的骡子沿着穿过山谷中间那蜿蜒的山路慢吞吞地走着；有时会隐约听到从山边传来的牧羊人的芦笛声；或是听到一头驴子慢慢走过时的铃声，后面还跟着一个光着脚的修道士，秃头亮光闪闪的，正给修道院送食物去。","I again took out my materials for drawing, and amused myself with sketching the magnificent prospect.It was now about noon, and every thing seemed sunk into repose, like the bandit that lay sleeping before me.The noon-tide stillness that reigned over these mountains, the vast landscape below, gleaming with distant towns and dotted with various habitations and signs of life, yet all so silent, had a powerful effect upon my mind.The intermediate valleys, too, that lie among mountains have a peculiar air of solitude.Few sounds are heard at mid-day to break the quiet of the scene.Sometimes the whistle of a solitary muleteer, lagging with his lazy animal along the road that winds through the centre of the valley; sometimes the faint piping of a shepherd’s reed from the side of the mountain, or sometimes the bell of an ass slowly pacing along, followed by a monk with bare feet and bare shining head, and carrying provisions to the convent."
"我在这群睡着的同伴中间又继续画了一会，最后，我看到强盗首领的队伍回来了，后面还跟着一个农民。那个农民牵着一头骡子，骡背上驮着一个装得鼓鼓的袋子。刚开始我还以为这是强盗新抓的猎物，可那个农民一副满足的神情让我放了心。我十分高兴地听说这就是所许诺的午饭。现在，有着秃鹰般敏锐嗅觉的强盗们都从山的三边跑过来了。大家都忙着卸下骡背上的袋子，把袋子里的东西打开。","I had continued to sketch for some time among my sleeping companions, when at length I saw the captain of the band approaching, followed by a peasant leading a mule, on which was a well-filled sack.I at first apprehended that this was some new prey fallen into the hands of the robbers, but the contented look of the peasant soon relieved me, and I was rejoiced to hear that it was our promised repast.The brigands now came running from the three sides of the mountain, having the quick scent of vultures.Every one busied himself in unloading the mule and relieving the sack of its contents."
"首先引入眼帘的是一只大火腿，那火腿的颜色和肥硕都会让特尼耶禁不住拿起笔来。接着看到的便是一大块奶酪、一袋煮栗子、一小桶酒和一大堆美味的家制面包了。所有东西都整齐对称地放在草地上，强盗首领把他的刀子递给我，告诉我不要客气。我们围着午餐坐下来，一时间除了用力的咀嚼声和酒在酒桶内绕圈轻快旋转地汩汩声外，就什么声音都没有了。我很久没吃东西了，再加上山里的空气和大量的活动，顿时觉得胃口大开。我觉得我从来没吃过比这更好更美味的一餐了。","The first thing that made its appearance was an enormous ham of a color and plumpness that would have inspired the pencil of Teniers.It was followed by a large cheese, a bag of boiled chestnuts, a little barrel of wine, and a quantity of good household bread.Everything was arranged on the grass with a degree of symmetry, and the captain presenting me his knife, requested me to help myself.We all seated ourselves round the viands, and nothing was heard for a time but the sound of vigorous mastication, or the gurgling of the barrel of wine as it revolved briskly about the circle.My long fasting and the mountain air and exercise had given me a keen appetite, and never did repast appear to me more excellent or picturesque."
"他们时不时就派一个强盗去观察一下平原的状况，附近没有敌人，大家午餐也就没有受到打扰。","From time to time one of the band was despatched to keep a look-out upon the plain: no enemy was at hand, and the dinner was undisturbed."
"后来，那位农民拿到了他所提供的食物近两倍的价钱，心满意足地下山了。丰盛的一餐过后，我精神倍增，尽管昨晚受伤的地方还在作痛，但眼前的奇特景象让我兴趣盎然，同时也满心欢喜。眼前这些粗俗的汉子和他们栖息之所似乎变得那么生动独特。他们的露营地、他们的守卫兵、他们中午在山脊上懒洋洋地休息、在岩石与林间草地上粗野地就餐——这一切都值得画家来描绘。但在夜幕降临的时候，我感到我内心的激情被完全激发出来。","The peasant received nearly twice the value of his provisions, and set off down the mountain highly satisfied with his bargain.I felt invigorated by the hearty meal I had made, and notwithstanding that the wound I had received the evening before was painful, yet I could not but feel extremely interested and gratified by the singular scenes continually presented to me.Every thing seemed pictured about these wild beings and their haunts.Their bivouacs, their groups on guard, their indolent noon-tide repose on the mountain brow, their rude repast on the herbage among rocks and trees, every thing presented a study for a painter.But it was towards the approach of evening that I felt the highest enthusiasm awakened."
"在空旷的阿布鲁奇原野上，落日渐渐西下，向树木葱郁的阿布鲁齐青葱的山巅射向灿烂的金光。远处，几座覆盖着白雪的山在阳光的照耀下灿烂夺目，和其他山形成鲜明对比。这些山笼罩在暮色苍茫之中，呈现出一片深紫色。天越来越暗，景色也都肃穆起来。四周静寂无声，荒山野岭都破碎成了岩石和悬崖，中间又夹有巨大的橡树、软木树和栗树，眼前又有一群群强盗，这让我想起了萨尔瓦托·罗萨粗犷景象。","The setting sun, declining beyond the vast Campagna, shed its rich yellow beams on the woody summits of the Abruzzi.Several mountains crowned with snow shone brilliantly in the distance, contrasting their brightness with others, which, thrown into shade, assumed deep tints of purple and violet.As the evening advanced, the landscape darkened into a sterner character.The immense solitude around; the wild mountains broken into rocks and precipices, intermingled with vast oak, cork, and chestnuts; and the groups of banditti in the foreground, reminded me of those savage scenes of Salvator Rosa."
"为了打发时间，强盗首领让他的手下把珠宝和浮雕宝石摆到我面前让我鉴别，以为我无疑是这方面的专家，能够评估它们的价值。他先带头拿出自己的宝贝，随后他的同伴也跟着拿了出来。顷刻之间，我眼前的草地上铺满了各式各样闪闪发光的珍珠宝石，连古董商或是贵妇看到这些都会眼花缭乱。这其中有几件珍贵的珠宝、古老的凹雕玉石和价值不菲的浮雕宝石，毋庸置疑，这些都是从有身份的旅客身上抢来的。我发现他们通常都把战利品拿到边境市镇上去出售。但这些地方通常人口稀少，住的都是些穷人，又鲜有旅客光顾，所以这些贵重风雅的奢侈品是没有市场的。我给他们提出建议，罗马聚有很多有钱的外国人，这些珠宝在他们那里肯定可以卖个好价钱。","To beguile the time the captain proposed to his comrades to spread before me their jewels and cameos, as I must doubtless be a judge of such articles, and able to inform them of their nature.He set the example, the others followed it, and in a few moments I saw the grass before me sparkling with jewels and gems that would have delighted the eyes of an antiquary or a fine lady.Among them were several precious jewels and antique intaglios and cameos of great value, the spoils doubtless of travellers of distinction.I found that they were in the habit of selling their booty in the frontier towns.As these in general were thinly and poorly peopled, and little frequented by travellers, they could offer no market for such valuable articles of taste and luxury.I suggested to them the certainty of their readily obtaining great pieces for these gems among the rich strangers with which Rome was thronged."
"显而易见，我这番话立刻引起了这些贪婪的强盗们的兴趣。一个原本默默无闻的年轻强盗向首领提出请求，让他第二天化装成罗马人去进行交易；他还用强盗的忠诚做担保（他们之间一种神圣的誓约），并承诺说两天以后一定回到他指定的任何一个地方。强盗首领答应了，接下来出现了一个奇怪的情景。其他强盗都急切地围到他身边，把自己想要出售的珠宝都放心地交给他，并告诉他自己的宝贝应该卖多少钱。他们彼此之间也相互讨价还价、交换和出售小玩意。我注意到，那个年轻的强盗花了六十美元买走了那个无赖从我身上抢走的那块手表，那块表有根链条，上面还有一些珍贵的印章。现在，我怀着一线希望，若是表被卖到罗马，说不定我还能设法将它买回来。","The impression made upon their greedy minds was immediately apparent.One of the band, a young man, and the least known, requested permission of the captain to depart the following day in disguise for Rome, for the purpose of traffick; promising on the faith of a bandit (a sacred pledge amongst them) to return in two days to any place he might appoint.The captain consented, and a curious scene took place.The robbers crowded round him eagerly, confiding to him such of their jewels as they wished to dispose of, and giving him instructions what to demand.There was bargaining and exchanging and selling of trinkets among themselves, and I beheld my watch, which had a chain and valuable seals, purchased by the young robber merchant of the ruffian who had plundered me, for sixty dollars.I now conceived a faint hope that if it went to Rome, I might somehow or other regain possession of it."
"与此同时，天越来越黑，前往土斯库鲁的信使还没有回来。","In the mean time day declined, and no messenger returned from Tusculum."
"想到还要跟这些强盗在树林里呆一个晚上，我就十分沮丧，因为我已经看够了强盗的生活。强盗首领现在命令他的手下跟着他，以便将他们安置在各自的岗位上。他又说，如果天黑之前信使还没回来的话，他们就转移到别的地方去。","The idea of passing another night in the woods was extremely disheartening; for I began to be satisfied with what I had seen of robber life.The chieftain now ordered his men to follow him, that he might station them at their posts, adding, that if the messenger did not return before night they must shift their quarters to some other place."
"我又跟那个原先看守我的士兵单独在一起了，他还是一脸的忧郁，目光憔悴，时不时还发出一声痛苦的讥笑。我打定主意要探索一下这颗受伤的心，于是我提醒他说，他曾答应要告诉我他为什么这么痛苦的。","I was again left alone with the young bandit who had before guarded me: he had the same gloomy air and haggard eye, with now and then a bitter sardonic smile.I was determined to probe this ulcerated heart, and reminded him of a kind of promise he had given me to tell me the cause of his suffering."
"在我看来，这些不安的灵魂放佛很高兴能得到这样一个机会，既能排遣自身，又能跟一些干净、健康的心灵进行沟通。我一提出这个要求，他就坐到我旁边，给我讲了他的故事。下面便是我尽力记下的故事。","It seemed to me as if these troubled spirits were glad of an opportunity to disburthen themselves; and of having some fresh undiseased mind with which they could communicate.I had hardly made the request but he seated himself by my side, and gave me his story in, as nearly as I can recollect, the following words."
