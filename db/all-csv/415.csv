"The Sacred Milk of Koumongoe","科蒙戈树的神圣汁液"
"by Andrew Lang","作者：安德鲁·朗格"
"Far way, in a very hot country, there once lived a man and woman who had two children, a son named Koane and a daughter called Thakane.","在很远的地方有个非常炎热的国家，那里曾住着一男一女，他们有两个孩子，儿子叫科安，女儿叫塞坎。"
"Early in the morning and late in the evenings the parents worked hard in the fields, resting, when the sun was high, under the shade of some tree.","这对父母在地里从早到晚都在辛勤劳作。当艳阳高照的时候，他们就在树阴下休息。"
"While they were absent the little girl kept house alone, for her brother always got up before the dawn, when the air was fresh and cool, and drove out the cattle to the sweetest patches of grass he could find.","当他们不在家的时候，小女孩就独自料理家务，因为她的哥哥总是在破晓之前就起床，那时的空气又新鲜又凉爽，他把牛群赶出屋子，到他能找到的最甘美的草地去放牧。"
"One day, when Koane had slept later than usual, his father and mother went to their work before him, and there was only Thakane to be seen busy making the bread for supper.","一天，科安比平时起得晚了一点儿，他的父母已经在他之前去劳作了，于是他只看到塞坎在忙着做面包当晚餐。"
"‘Thakane,’ he said, ‘I am thirsty.","“塞坎，”他说，“我渴了。"
"Give me a drink from the tree Koumongoe, which has the best milk in the world.’","给我喝一点儿科蒙戈树的汁液吧，这种树的汁液是世界上最好的。”"
"‘Oh, Koane,’ cried his sister, ‘you know that we are forbidden to touch that tree.","“噢，科安，”他的妹妹喊了起来，“你知道，我们不能碰那棵树。"
"What would father say when he came home?","爸爸回家的时候会说什么？"
"For he would be sure to know.’","只要我们碰了那棵树，他一定会知道的。”"
"‘Nonsense,’ replied Koane, ‘there is so much milk in Koumongoe that he will never miss a little.","“胡说，”科安答道，“科蒙戈树有那么多的汁液，他绝对不会注意到少了一点儿的。"
"If you won’t give it to me, I shan’t take the cattle out.","如果你不给我喝，那我就不出去放牛。"
"They will just have to stay all day in the hut, and you know that they will starve.’","这些牛群就得整天呆在小屋里，你知道它们会挨饿的。”"
" And he turned from her in a rage, and sat down in the corner.","于是他一怒之下转过身去，背朝着她，坐在了角落里。"
"After a while Thakane said to him: ‘It is getting hot, had you better drive out the cattle now?’","过了一会儿，塞坎对他说：“天变热了，你是不是最好该出去放牛了？”"
"But Koane only answered sulkily: ‘I told you I am not going to drive them out at all.","但科安只是闷闷不乐地答道：“我已经告诉你了，我决不会出去放牛。"
"If I have to do without milk, they shall do without grass.’","如果我喝不到汁液，那它们也吃不到草。”"
"Thakane did not know what to do.","塞坎有些不知所措。"
"She was afraid to disobey her parents, who would most likely beat her, yet the beasts would be sure to suffer if they were kept in, and she would perhaps be beaten for that too.","她不敢违抗父母，他们很可能会因此打她，但如果牲口呆在小屋内肯定会挨饿，她还是可能会因此而挨打。"
"So at last she took an axe and a tiny earthen bowl, she cut a very small hole in the side of Koumongoe, and out gushed enough milk to fill the bowl.","所以她最终拿了一柄斧头和一个小钵，在科蒙戈树的侧面切了一个小小的口子，让汁液涌了出来，装满了小钵。"
"‘Here is the milk you wanted,’ said she, going up to Koane, who was still sulking in his corner.","“这是你要的汁液。”她一边说一边向科安走去。科安还坐在角落，生着闷气。"
"‘What is the use of that?’ grumbled Koane; ‘why, there is not enough to drown a fly.","“就这点儿有什么用？”科安嘟囔着说，“哎呀，这还不够淹死一只苍蝇呢。"
"Go and get me three times as much!’","去给我弄三倍的汁液过来！”"
"Trembling with fright, Thakane returned to the tree, and struck it a sharp blow with the axe.","塞坎很害怕，她发抖着走到科蒙戈树前，用斧子重重地砍了一下。"
"In an instant there poured forth such a stream of milk that it ran like a river into the hut.","一股树汁立刻源源不断地涌了出来，像一条小河一样流进了小屋。"
"‘Koane!","“科安！"
"Koane!’ cried she, ‘come and help me to plug up the hole.","科安！”她喊道，“快过来帮我堵上这个洞。"
"There will be no milk left for our father and mother.’","这样下去的话，汁液会流光的，爸妈就没有汁液可以喝了。”"
" But Koane could not stop it any more than Thakane, and soon the milk was flowing through the hut downhill towards their parents in the fields below.","但科安也和塞坎一样，没法阻止汁液从科蒙戈树里流出来。很快，汁液就穿过小屋，向山下他们父母劳作的田野流去。"
"The man saw a white stream a long way off, and guessed what had happened.","男人看到远处一股白色的液体像河流般涌下来，猜到发生了什么事。"
"‘Wife, wife,’ he called loudly to the woman, who was working at a little distance: ‘Do you see Koumongoe running fast down the hill?","“老婆，老婆，”他大声对在不远处劳作的妻子喊道，“你有没有看到山上有科蒙戈树的汁液流下来，还流得很快？"
"That is some mischief of the children’s, I am sure.","我确信这是孩子们的恶作剧。"
"I must go home and find out what is the matter.’","我必须回家看看发生了什么事。”"
" And they both threw down their hoes and hurried to the side of Koumongoe.","于是他们两人扔下锄头，急匆匆地赶到科蒙戈树旁边。"
"Kneeling on the grass, the man and his wife made a cup of their hands and drank the milk from it.","男人和他的妻子跪在草地上，双手作杯，掬起汁液喝了起来。"
"And no sooner had they done this, than Koumongoe flowed back again up the hill, and entered the hut.","他们刚喝到汁液，科蒙戈树的汁液就立刻流回了山上，回到了小屋内。"
"‘Thakane,’ said the parents, severely, when they reached home panting from the heat of the sun, ‘what have you been doing?","“塞坎，”父母回到家时被骄阳晒得直喘气，他们严厉地责问道，“你都做了些什么？"
"Why did Koumongoe come to us in the fields instead of staying in the garden?’","为什么科蒙戈树的汁液流向了我们的田野，而不是留在花园中？”"
"‘It was Koane’s fault,’ answered Thakane.","“是科安的错，”塞坎答道，"
"‘He would not take the cattle to feed until he drank some of the milk from Koumongoe.","“他喝不到科蒙戈树的汁液就不愿意去放牛。"
"So, as I did not know what else to do, I gave it to him.’","我不知道我还能怎么办，所以我只好给了他科蒙戈树的汁液。”"
"The father listened to Thakane’s words, but made no answer.","父亲听了塞坎的话，但没有回答。"
"Instead, he went outside and brought in two sheepskins, which he stained red and sent for a blacksmith to forge some iron rings.","他走了出去，拿进来两张羊皮。他把羊皮染成红色，并叫来铁匠打了一些铁环。"
"The rings were then passed over Thakane’s arms and legs and neck, and the skins fastened on her before and behind.","然后他把这些铁环穿到塞坎的胳膊、腿和脖子上，然后再把羊皮一前一后地系在她身上。"
"When all was ready, the man sent for his servants and said:","做好这些事后，男子叫来他的仆人，说："
"‘I am going to get rid of Thakane.’","“我打算抛弃塞坎。”"
"‘Get rid of your only daughter?’ they answered, in surprise.","“抛弃您唯一的女儿？”他们惊讶地问，"
"‘But why?’","“但是为什么要这样做呢？”"
"‘Because she has eaten what she ought not to have eaten.","“因为她喝了不该喝的东西。"
"She has touched the sacred tree which belongs to her mother and me alone.’","她碰了这棵神圣的树，而这棵树是专属于我和她母亲的。”"
" And, turning his back, he called to Thakane to follow him, and they went down the road which led to the dwelling of an ogre.","然后他转过身去，让塞坎跟着他，他们沿着小路走下去，小路通往一个食人魔的住处。"
"They were passing along some fields where the corn was ripening, when a rabbit suddenly sprang out at their feet, and standing on its hind legs, it sang:","他们沿着玉米正在成熟的田野走下去，一只兔子突然跳出来，蹦到他们脚边，用后腿站立起来，唱道："
"Why do you give to the ogre Your child, so fair, so fair?","“你为什么要把你的孩子送给食人魔呢？她是如此美丽，如此美丽。”"
"‘You had better ask her,’ replied the man, ‘she is old enough to give you an answer.’","“你最好问她，”男子回答道，“她这个年纪已经能够回答你的问题了。”"
"Then, in her turn, Thakane sang:","于是，轮到塞坎唱道："
"I gave Koumongoe to Koane, Koumongoe to the keeper of beasts; For without Koumongoe they could not go to the meadows: Without Koumongoe they would starve in the hut; That was why I gave him the Koumongoe of my father.","“我把科蒙戈树汁液给了科安，把科蒙戈树汁液给了牧牛人；因为没有科蒙戈树汁液，牛儿就没法去草地吃草：没有科蒙戈树汁液，牛儿就要在小屋中挨饿；所以我把我父亲的科蒙戈树汁液给了他。”"
"And when the rabbit heard that, he cried: ‘Wretched man! it is you whom the ogre should eat, and not your beautiful daughter.’","当兔子听到这句话时，它对男子喊了起来：“可恶的男人！食人魔应该吃了你，而不是你美丽的女儿。”"
"But the father paid no heed to what the rabbit said, and only walked on the faster, bidding Thakane to keep close behind him.","但是父亲没有理会兔子说的话，只是继续走得更快了，并吩咐塞坎紧紧地跟在他后面。"
"By-and-by they met with a troop of great deer, called elands, and they stopped when they saw Thakane and sang:","没过多久，他们碰到了一群像鹿一样的大型动物，它们叫做大羚羊。它们看到塞坎后停了下来，唱道："
"Why do you give to the ogre Your child, so fair, so fair?","“你为什么要把你的孩子送给食人魔呢？她是如此美丽，如此美丽。”"
"‘You had better ask her,’ replied the man, ‘she is old enough to give you an answer.’","“你最好问她，”男子回答道，“她这个年纪已经能够回答你的问题了。”"
"Then, in her turn, Thakane sang:","于是，轮到塞坎唱道："
"I gave Koumongoe to Koane, Koumongoe to the keeper of beasts; For without Koumongoe they could not go to the meadows: Without Koumongoe they would starve in the hut; That was why I gave him the Koumongoe of my father.","“我把科蒙戈树汁液给了科安，把科蒙戈树汁液给了牧牛人；因为没有科蒙戈树汁液，牛儿就没法去草地吃草：牛儿就要在小屋中挨饿；所以我把我父亲的科蒙戈树汁液给了他。”"
"And the elands all cried: ‘Wretched man! it is you whom the ogre should eat, and not your beautiful daughter.’","大羚羊一齐喊了起来：“可恶的男人！食人魔应该吃了你，而不是你美丽的女儿。”"
"By this time it was nearly dark, and the father said they could travel no further that night, and must go to sleep where they were.","这时候，天快要黑了，父亲便说他们今晚不能再赶路了，必须就地睡觉。"
"Thakane was thankful indeed when she heard this, for she was very tired, and found the two skins fastened round her almost too heavy to carry.","塞坎听到后非常感激，因为她已经很疲乏了，并且她觉得系在她身上的两块羊皮重得几乎背不动了。"
"So, in spite of her dread of the ogre, she slept till dawn, when her father woke her, and told her roughly that he was ready to continue their journey.","所以尽管她害怕食人魔，但她还是一觉睡到了天亮，直到她的父亲把她叫起来，粗鲁地告诉她：他准备继续他们的行程。"
"Crossing the plain, the girl and her father passed a herd of gazelles feeding.","女孩和她的父亲穿过平原时遇到一群正在吃草的瞪羚。"
"They lifted their heads, wondering who was out so early, and when they caught sight of Thakane, they sang:","它们抬起头，不明白有谁会这么早出门，当它们看见塞坎的时候，它们唱道："
"Why do you give to the ogre Your child, so fair, so fair?","“你为什么要把你的孩子送给食人魔呢？她是如此美丽，如此美丽。”"
"‘You had better ask her, replied the man, ‘she is old enough to answer for herself.’","“你最好问她，”男子回答道，“她这个年龄已经能够回答你的问题了。”"
"Then, in her turn, Thakane sang:","于是，轮到塞坎唱道："
"I gave Koumongoe to Koane, Koumongoe to the keeper of beasts; For without Koumongoe they could not go to the meadows: Without Koumongoe they would starve in the hut; That was why I gave him the Koumongoe of my father.","“我把科蒙戈汁液给了科安，把科蒙戈树汁液给了牧牛人；因为没有科蒙戈树汁液，牛儿就没法去草地吃草：没有科蒙戈树汁液，牛儿就得在小屋中挨饿；因此我把我父亲的科蒙戈树汁液给了他。”"
"And the gazelles all cried: ‘Wretched man! it is you whom the ogre should eat, and not your beautiful daughter.’","于是瞪羚一齐喊道：“可恶的男人！食人魔应该吃了你，而不是你美丽的女儿。”"
"At last they arrived at the village where the ogre lived, and they went straight to his hut.","最后，他们到达了食人魔居住的村子，然后他们径直走向他的小屋。"
"He was nowhere to be seen, but in his place was his son Masilo, who was not an ogre at all, but a very polite young man.","食人魔不见踪影，但他的儿子马西洛在他的住处。马西洛绝不是一个食人魔，而是一个非常有礼貌的年轻人。"
"He ordered his servants to bring a pile of skins for Thakane to sit on, but told her father he must sit on the ground.","他吩咐仆人拿来一堆羊皮，好让塞坎坐在上面，却让她的父亲必须坐在地上。"
"Then, catching sight of the girl’s face, which she had kept down, he was struck by its beauty, and put the same question that the rabbit, and the elands, and the gazelles had done.","塞坎一直低着头，当马西洛看到这女孩的脸庞时，立刻就被这张美丽的面孔迷住了，于是他问了兔子、大羚羊和瞪羚问过的问题。"
"Thakane answered him as before, and he instantly commanded that she should be taken to the hut of his mother, and placed under her care, while the man should be led to his father.","塞坎也像先前那样作了回答，于是他立即命令仆人把塞坎带到他母亲的小屋，由母亲照顾她，而把男子带到他父亲那里。"
"Directly the ogre saw him he bade the servant throw him into the great pot which always stood ready on the fire, and in five minutes he was done to a turn.","食人魔看到男子后，立即吩咐仆人把他扔进总是架在火上的一口大锅，五分钟后，他就被煮熟了。"
"After that the servant returned to Masilo and related all that had happened.","然后仆人回到了马西洛那里，向他叙述了发生的一切。"
"Now Masilo had fallen in loved with Thakane the moment he saw her.","要知道，马西洛从看到塞坎的那一刻起就已经爱上了她。"
"At first he did not know what to make of this strange feeling, for all his life he had hated women, and had refused several brides whom his parents had chosen for him.","一开始，他不知道是怎么产生这种奇怪的感觉的，因为他一生都憎恨女子，并拒绝了父母为他挑选的几位新娘。"
"However, they were so anxious that he should marry, that they willingly accepted Thakane as their daughter-in-law, though she did bring any marriage portion with her.","然而，由于马西洛的父母盼望他能够快点儿结婚，所以尽管塞坎没有带来任何嫁妆，他们也乐于接受塞坎做他们的儿媳。"
"After some time a baby was born to her, and Thakane thought it was the most beautiful baby that ever was seen.","一段时间后，塞坎生了一个婴儿，她认为这是她所见过的最漂亮的孩子。"
"But when her mother-in-law saw it was a girl, she wrung her hands and wept, saying:","但当她的婆婆看到是个女婴的时候，她绞着双手，哭着说："
"‘O miserable mother!","“噢！悲惨的母亲！"
"Miserable child!","悲惨的孩子！"
"Alas for you! why were you not a boy!’","为你叹息！为什么你不是个男孩！”"
"Thakane, in great surprise, asked the meaning of her distress; and the old woman told her that it was the custom in that country that all the girls who were born should be given to the ogre to eat.","塞坎非常吃惊，问她为什么这么悲痛；老妇人告诉她，这个国家有一个风俗，那就是要把所有出生的女孩都送给食人魔吃掉。"
"Then Thakane clasped the baby tightly in her arms, and cried:","于是塞坎把婴儿紧紧抱在怀里，喊道："
"‘But it is not the customer in MY country!","“但这不是‘我的’国家的风俗！"
"There, when children die, they are buried in the earth.","在我的国家里，死去的婴儿会被安葬在泥土里。"
"No one shall take my baby from me.’","没人能把我的孩子从我身边带走。”"
"That night, when everyone in the hut was asleep, Thakane rose, and carrying her baby on her back, went down to a place where the river spread itself out into a large lake, with tall willows all round the bank.","当晚，当小屋中所有的人都在睡梦中的时候，塞坎起了床，背上背着婴儿，向下一直走到河流汇入大湖的地方，在那里围绕着河岸长着高高的柳树。"
"Here, hidden from everyone, she sat down on a stone and began to think what she should do to save her child.","在这里，没人能找到她，她坐在了一块石头上，开始思考她该做什么来救她的孩子。"
"Suddenly she heard a rustling among the willows, and an old woman appeared before her.","突然，她听到柳树林中传来沙沙声，接着一个老妇人出现在她的面前。"
"‘What are you crying for, my dear?’ said she.","“亲爱的，你在哭什么？”她说。"
"And Thakane answered: ‘I was crying for my baby—I cannot hide her for ever, and if the ogre sees her, he will eat her; and I would rather she was drowned than that.’","塞坎答道：“我在为我的孩子哭泣——我不能永远藏着她，如果食人魔看到她，他会吃了她的；我宁愿她被淹死也不愿她被吃掉。”"
"‘What you say is true,’ replied the old woman.","“你说得没错，”老妇人回答道，"
"‘Give me your child, and let me take care of it.","“把你的孩子给我吧，让我来照顾她。"
"And if you will fix a day to meet me here I will bring the baby.’","如果你约定一天到这里来见我，我会把孩子带来。”"
"Then Thakane dried her eyes, and gladly accepted the old woman’s offer.","于是塞坎擦干了眼泪，高兴地接受了老妇人的提议。"
"When she got home she told her husband she had thrown it in the river, and as he had watched her go in that direction he never thought of doubting what she said.","她回家的时候告诉丈夫，她已经把婴儿扔在河里了；由于马西洛看到她朝小河的方向走了，他从来没有想到去怀疑她所说的话。"
"On the appointed day, Thakane slipped out when everybody was busy, and ran down the path that led to the lake.","在约好的那天，塞坎趁其他人忙碌的时候溜了出去，顺着通向湖泊的小路向下跑去。"
"As soon as she got there, she crouched down among the willows, and sang softly:","她一到那里就蹲伏在柳树林中，轻轻地唱道："
"Bring to me Dilah, Dilah the rejected one, Dilah, whom her father Masilo cast out!","“把迪拉带给我，把被遗弃的迪拉带给我，把被父亲马西洛赶了出来的迪拉带给我！”"
"And in a moment the old woman appeared holding the baby in her arms.","然后，老妇人立刻出现了，怀中抱着孩子。"
"Dilah had become so big and strong, that Thakane’s heart was filled with joy and gratitude, and she stayed as long as she dared, playing with her baby.","迪拉长得很大了，变得很健壮，塞坎的心里充满了快乐和感激。她尽可能地在那里多呆一会儿，和她的孩子玩耍。"
"At last she felt she must return to the village, lest she should be missed, and the child was handed back to the old woman, who vanished with her into the lake.","最后，她觉得她必须回到村子里了，以免被人察觉，她把孩子交回给老妇人，老妇人带着孩子一同消失在了湖中。"
"Children grow up very quickly when they live under water, and in less time than anyone could suppose, Dilah had changed from a baby to a woman.","在水下，孩子长得非常快，没人能想象到在那么短的时间内，迪拉已经从一个婴儿变成了一个姑娘。"
"Her mother came to visit her whenever she was able, and one day, when they were sitting talking together, they were spied out by a man who had come to cut willows to weave into baskets.","她的母亲只要有机会就去看她，然后有一天，当她们坐在一起聊天的时候，一个来砍柳枝编篮子的男子窥探到了她们。"
"He was so surprised to see how like the face of the girl was to Masilo, that he left his work and returned to the village.","他看到女孩的面孔和马西洛长得十分相像，这让他感到很吃惊，于是他放下工作回到了村子。"
"‘Masilo,’ he said, as he entered the hut, ‘I have just beheld your wife near the river with a girl who must be your daughter, she is so like you.","“马西洛，”他一进入小屋就说道，“我刚刚看到你的妻子在河边和一个女孩呆在一起，那个女孩一定是你的女儿，她和你长得很像。"
"We have been deceived, for we all thought she was dead.’","我们都上当了，因为我们都以为她死了。”"
"When he heard this, Masilo tried to look shocked because his wife had broken the law; but in his heart he was very glad.","当马西洛听到这些话的时候，他努力让自己看上去很震怒，因为他的妻子破坏了规则，但他心里却非常高兴。"
"‘But what shall we do now?’ asked he.","“但我们现在该做什么呢？”他问。"
"‘Make sure for yourself that I am speaking the truth by hiding among the bushes the first time Thakane says she is going to bathe in the river, and waiting till the girl appears.’","“请你亲自确认我说的是是不是实话。当塞坎下一次说要去河里洗澡时，你可以躲在灌木丛中等女孩出现。”"
"For some days Thakane stayed quietly at home, and her husband began to think that the man had been mistaken; but at last she said to her husband: ‘I am going to bathe in the river.’","一连几天，塞坎都安静地呆在家里，连她的丈夫都开始以为是那个男子弄错了；但最后，她对她的丈夫说：“我要去河里洗澡。”"
"‘Well, you can go,’ answered he.","“哦，你可以去。”他说。"
"But he ran down quickly by another path, and got there first, and hid himself in the bushes.","但他迅速沿着另一条小路跑下去，抢先到了那里，藏身在灌木丛中。"
"An instant later, Thakane arrived, and standing on the bank, she sang:","片刻之后，塞坎到了。她站在河岸上，唱道："
"Bring to me Dilah, Dilah the rejected one, Dilah, whom her father Masilo cast out!","“把迪拉带给我，把被遗弃的迪拉带给我，把被父亲马西洛赶了出来的迪拉带给我！”"
"Then the old woman came out of the water, holding the girl, now tall and slender, by the hand.","然后，老妇人从水中走了出来，手中牵着已经长得又高又苗条的女孩。"
"And as Masilo looked, he saw that she was indeed his daughter, and he wept for joy that she was not lying dead in the bottom of the lake.","马西洛一看，发现她确实是自己的女儿，他高兴得哭了，因为她没有死在湖底。"
"The old woman, however, seemed uneasy, and said to Thakane: ‘I feel as if someone was watching us.","老妇人却显得很不安，她对塞坎说：“我觉得好像有人在看着我们。"
"I will not leave the girl to-day, but will take her back with me’; and sinking beneath the surface, she drew the girl after her.","我今天不会留下这个女孩，而会把她带回去。”说完便拉着身后的女孩，沉入水中。"
"After they had gone, Thakane returned to the village, which Masilo had managed to reach before her.","她们走了以后，塞坎回到了村子。马西洛已经设法在她之前回到了村子。"
"All the rest of the day he sat in a corner weeping, and his mother who came in asked: ‘Why are you weeping so bitterly, my son?’","在那一天余下的时间里，他都坐在墙角哭泣，他的母亲过来问：“我的孩子，你为什么哭得如此悲伤？”"
"‘My head aches,’ he answered; ‘it aches very badly.’","“我头疼，”他答道，“疼得非常厉害。”"
" And his mother passed on, and left him alone.","他的母亲走开了，没去管他。"
"In the evening he said to his wife: ‘I have seen my daughter, in the place where you told me you had drowned her.","晚上，他对他的妻子说：“我看到了我的女儿，就在你告诉我你淹死她的那个地方。"
"Instead, she lives at the bottom of the lake, and has now grown into a young woman.’","她没有淹死，而是住在湖底，现在已经长成一个年轻姑娘了。”"
"‘I don’t know what you are talking about,’ replied Thakane.","“我不明白你在说什么，”塞坎说，"
"‘I buried my child under the sand on the beach.’","“我把我的孩子埋在了沙滩的沙子里。”"
"Then Masilo implored her to give the child back to him; but she would not listen, and only answered: ‘If I were to give her back you would only obey the laws of your country and take her to your father, the ogre, and she would be eaten.’","马西洛恳求她把孩子还给他，但她不肯听，只是回答说：“如果我把她还给你，你只会遵照你国家里的规则，把她带给你的食人魔父亲，他会吃了她的。”"
"But Masilo promised that he would never let his father see her, and that now she was a woman no one would try to hurt her; so Thakane’s heart melted, and she went down to the lake to consult the old woman.","但马西洛保证说绝对不会让自己的父亲看到她，并且她现在已经是一个姑娘了，没人会去伤害她；于是塞坎心软了，她向下走到湖边去和老妇人商量。"
"‘What am I to do?’ she asked, when, after clapping her hands, the old woman appeared before her.","她拍拍手，老妇人出现在她的面前。“我该做什么呢？”塞坎问，"
"‘Yesterday Masilo beheld Dilah, and ever since he has entreated me to give him back his daughter.’","“昨天马西洛看到了迪拉，从那以后，他一直在恳求我把女儿还给他。”"
"‘If I let her go he must pay me a thousand head of cattle in exchange,’ replied the old woman.","“如果要我放她走，他必须付给我一千头牛来交换。”老妇人回答说。"
"And Thakane carried her answer back to Masilo.","塞坎把她的答复传达给了马西洛。"
"‘Why, I would gladly give her two thousand!’ cried he, ‘for she has saved my daughter.’","“哎呀！我乐意给她两千头牛！”他喊道，“因为她救了我的女儿。”"
" And he bade messengers hasten to all the neighbouring villages, and tell his people to send him at once all the cattle he possessed.","他吩咐信使迅速赶到附近的村庄，让他的百姓立即把所有属于他的牛都赶到他面前。"
"When they were all assembled he chose a thousand of the finest bulls and cows, and drove them down to the river, followed by a great crowd wondering what would happen.","当所有的牛都被赶到一起后，他挑选了一千头最好的公牛和奶牛，把它们一路赶到了河边，后面跟着一大群人，他们想知道发生了什么事。"
"Then Thakane stepped forward in front of the cattle and sang:","然后塞坎走上前去，站在牛群前面，唱道："
"Bring to me Dilah, Dilah the rejected one, Dilah, whom her father Masilo cast out!","“把迪拉带给我，把被遗弃的迪拉带给我，把被父亲马西洛赶了出来的迪拉带给我！”"
"And Dilah came from the waters holding out her hands to Masilo and Thakane, and in her place the cattle sank into the lake, and were driven by the old woman to the great city filled with people, which lies at the bottom.","于是迪拉从水中出来了，向马西洛和塞坎伸出了双手，牛群在她的位置沉入了湖中，一个老妇人赶着它们向湖底的一个熙熙攘攘的大城市走去。"
