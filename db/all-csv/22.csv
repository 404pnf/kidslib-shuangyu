"第一章 一个感恩的民族","Chapter 1 A Grateful People"
"海牙城一直是那么充满活力、整洁干净，公园绿树成阴，哥特式的房屋周围布满了高大的树木，运河像一面大镜子，倒映着尖塔和带有东方色彩的炮塔楼，这一切会让人以为每天都是礼拜日——一六七二年八月二十日那天，在七省联邦的首府海牙，所有交通要道都涌满了穿着黑色和红色衣服的人流。那些行色匆匆、气喘吁吁、焦躁不安的人们，有的腰间插着刀，有的肩上扛着枪，还有人手里拿着棍子。他们纷纷奔向布伊坦霍夫，那是一座阴森的监狱，现在都能看到那里的带铁栏的窗户。荷兰议长的哥哥科尔内留斯·德维特就关在那里，因为一个叫第克莱尔的外科医生指控他试图谋杀。","On the 20th of August, 1672, the city of the Hague, always so lively, so neat, and so trim that one might believe every day to be Sunday, with its shady park, with its tall trees, spreading over its Gothic houses, with its canals like large mirrors, in which its steeples and its almost Eastern cupolas are reflected,—the city of the Hague, the capital of the Seven United Provinces, was swelling in all its arteries with a black and red stream of hurried, panting, and restless citizens, who, with their knives in their girdles, muskets on their shoulders, or sticks in their hands, were pushing on to the Buytenhof, a terrible prison, the grated windows of which are still shown, where, on the charge of attempted murder preferred against him by the surgeon Tyckelaer, Cornelius de Witt, the brother of the Grand Pensionary of Holland was confined."
"如果那个时代的历史，尤其是我们故事开始那一年的历史，与刚刚提及的两个名字没有密不可分的关系的话，我们将要补充说明的篇章似乎显得相当累赘。但我们开门见山就告知读者——我们的老朋友，我们在第一页就向你们保证，你们会饶有兴致地读下去，我们也总是就我们能力所及信守诺言——要正确理解我们的故事以及该故事背后的那一重大事件本身，这一解释说明是必不可少的。","If the history of that time, and especially that of the year in the middle of which our narrative commences, were not indissolubly connected with the two names just mentioned, the few explanatory pages which we are about to add might appear quite supererogatory; but we will, from the very first, apprise the reader—our old friend, to whom we are wont on the first page to promise amusement, and with whom we always try to keep our word as well as is in our power—that this explanation is as indispensable to the right understanding of our story as to that of the great event itself on which it is based."
"科尔内留斯·德维特，“普尔唐的留亚特”，也就是海堤视察官，曾当过他的故乡多特市的市长，也曾当过荷兰国会议员。他四十九岁那年，荷兰人民厌倦了荷兰议长约翰·德维特所理解的共和制，突然更强烈地拥护起总督制，而总督制早已由约翰·德维特在七省联邦颁布实行的《永久法令》在荷兰永久废除了。","Cornelius de Witt, Ruart de Pulten, that is to say, warden of the dikes, ex-burgomaster of Dort, his native town, and member of the Assembly of the States of Holland, was forty-nine years of age, when the Dutch people, tired of the Republic such as John de Witt, the Grand Pensionary of Holland, understood it, at once conceived a most violent affection for the Stadtholderate, which had been abolished for ever in Holland by the “Perpetual Edict” forced by John de Witt upon the United Provinces."
"民意反复无常，很少不拿某一个人来界定一个政治理念。因此，人们看到的共和制化身就是德维特兄弟俩的严厉形象。这两个荷兰的罗马人，不屑去迎合民众的喜好，坚持认为要不屈不挠地忠于自由，但不散漫放肆，要不屈不挠地忠于繁荣，但不铺张浪费，但另一方面，总督制以年轻的奥兰治亲王威廉严肃多思的形象越来越深入民心。","As it rarely happens that public opinion, in its whimsical flights, does not identify a principle with a man, thus the people saw the personification of the Republic in the two stern figures of the brothers De Witt, those Romans of Holland, spurning to pander to the fancies of the mob, and wedding themselves with unbending fidelity to liberty without licentiousness, and prosperity without the waste of superfluity; on the other hand, the Stadtholderate recalled to the popular mind the grave and thoughtful image of the young Prince William of Orange."
"德维特兄弟处处迎合路易十四，他的道德影响力遍及整个欧洲，荷兰在那场不可思议的莱茵河战役中也感受到了他巨大的威慑力，只用了短短三个月，那场战争就让七省联邦俯首称臣了。","The brothers De Witt humoured Louis XIV., whose moral influence was felt by the whole of Europe, and the pressure of whose material power Holland had been made to feel in that marvellous campaign on the Rhine, which, in the space of three months, had laid the power of the United Provinces prostrate."
"路易十四一直以来都是荷兰人的敌人，他们恣意侮辱或奚落他，尽管必须指出的是他们一般是借法国难民之口宣泄他们的怨恨。他们的民族自尊心把他推崇为共和的米特拉达梯。因此，德维特兄弟要对抗双重困难，一是要对抗全民的抵触情绪，此外还要对抗败北的民众自然而然产生的一种厌倦感，他们希望有新的领袖能救他们于毁灭和耻辱之中。","Louis XIV. had long been the enemy of the Dutch, who insulted or ridiculed him to their hearts’ content, although it must be said that they generally used French refugees for the mouthpiece of their spite.Their national pride held him up as the Mithridates of the Republic.The brothers De Witt, therefore, had to strive against a double difficulty,—against the force of national antipathy, and, besides, against the feeling of weariness which is natural to all vanquished people, when they hope that a new chief will be able to save them from ruin and shame."
"这个新领袖，早就准备好登上政治舞台去和路易十四较量了，无论这位伟大的君主未来的前途看起来多么远大。这个新领袖就是奥兰治亲王威廉，威廉二世和亨利埃特·斯图亚特的儿子，也就是英王查理一世的外孙。我们前面提到过他，人们就是期望通过他实现总督制的复辟。","This new chief, quite ready to appear on the political stage, and to measure himself against Louis XIV., however gigantic the fortunes of the Grand Monarch loomed in the future, was William, Prince of Orange, son of William II., and grandson, by his mother Henrietta Stuart, of Charles I. of England.We have mentioned him before as the person by whom the people expected to see the office of Stadtholder restored."
"一六七二年，这位年轻人二十二岁。他的家庭教师约翰·德维特把他培养成人，期望他成为一个好公民。在自己的学生和国家之间，这位老师更爱自己的国家，他通过颁布《永久法令》，扑灭了这位年轻亲王曾经可能怀揣的有朝一日成为总督的希望。但是上帝嘲笑人类的自以为是，居然不征求上天的意见就擅自建立和推翻世间的政权。荷兰人民的反复无常，再加上路易十四造成的恐惧，使人们撤销了《永久法令》，重建总督制，拥戴奥兰治亲王威廉登上宝座。上帝之手已经在那张未来的隐形地图上为威廉勾画出他将来的命运。","This young man was, in 1672, twenty-two years of age.John de Witt, who was his tutor, had brought him up with the view of making him a good citizen.Loving his country better than he did his disciple, the master had, by the Perpetual Edict, extinguished the hope which the young Prince might have entertained of one day becoming Stadtholder.But God laughs at the presumption of man, who wants to raise and prostrate the powers on earth without consulting the King above; and the fickleness and caprice of the Dutch combined with the terror inspired by Louis XIV., in repealing the Perpetual Edict, and re-establishing the office of Stadtholder in favour of William of Orange, for whom the hand of Providence had traced out ulterior destinies on the hidden map of the future."
"议长屈从了他国民同胞们的意见，但科尔内留斯·德维特却更为固执一些，尽管奥兰治派的暴民包围了他在多特的房子，频频威胁他的生命，他还是断然拒绝在复辟总督制的法案上签字。在他妻子的眼泪与哀求之下，他终于屈从了，但他在他的签名后加了两个字母V. C.（为暴力所迫），以此表明他仅仅是为暴力所迫。","The Grand Pensionary bowed before the will of his fellow citizens; Cornelius de Witt, however, was more obstinate, and notwithstanding all the threats of death from the Orangist rabble, who besieged him in his house at Dort, he stoutly refused to sign the act by which the office of Stadtholder was restored.Moved by the tears and entreaties of his wife, he at last complied, only adding to his signature the two letters V. C. (Vi Coactus), notifying thereby that he only yielded to force."
"那一天，他能躲过敌人的毒手，真是天大的奇迹。","It was a real miracle that on that day he escaped from the doom intended for him."
"约翰·德维特虽然很乐意地顺从了他同胞们的意愿，但却没从中得到任何好处。此后没几天就有人企图刺杀他，伤势虽不致命，但也够严重的。","John de Witt derived no advantage from his ready compliance with the wishes of his fellow citizens.Only a few days after, an attempt was made to stab him, in which he was severely although not mortally wounded."
"奥兰治派绝不会善罢甘休。只要这两兄弟活着，就始终是他们实施计划的绊脚石，于是，他们改变了策略，打算用诽谤达到他们用匕首未能达到的效果。","This by no means suited the views of the Orange faction.The life of the two brothers being a constant obstacle to their plans, they changed their tactics, and tried to obtain by calumny what they had not been able to effect by the aid of the poniard."
"在恰当的时刻，能有一个伟大的人来领导执行这些宏伟高尚的计划，这是非常难得的。因此，一旦有这样机缘巧合的事出现，历史会立刻铭记这位上帝选民的姓名，并让他名垂青史，受到子孙的景仰。可是，当撒旦要想介入世事，给某人幸福的生活投下阴影，或是推翻一个王朝时，他几乎总能在自己身边找到某个卑劣的帮手，他只需在那人耳边低语几句，就能让他立即开始执行任务。","How rarely does it happen that, in the right moment, a great man is found to head the execution of vast and noble designs; and for that reason, when such a providential concurrence of circumstances does occur, history is prompt to record the name of the chosen one, and to hold him up to the admiration of posterity.But when Satan interposes in human affairs to cast a shadow upon some happy existence, or to overthrow a kingdom, it seldom happens that he does not find at his side some miserable tool, in whose ear he has but to whisper a word to set him at once about his task."
"手头这个无耻的工具，也就是这次卑鄙阴谋的代理人，就是我们前面已经提过的那个叫第克莱尔的外科医生。","The wretched tool who was at hand to be the agent of this dastardly plot was one Tyckelaer whom we have already mentioned, a surgeon by profession."
"他向有关当局揭发科尔内留斯·德维特，他信口雌黄地说视察官签名后加的两个字母表明，他对撤销《永久法令》极为恼火。因此，出于对奥兰治亲王威廉的仇恨，他雇了一个杀手准备行刺新共和国的新总督。而他，第克莱尔就是被选中的杀手，可是一想到人家要他干这种勾当，他就毛骨悚然，所以他情愿揭发此罪行，也不愿明知故犯。","He lodged an information against Cornelius de Witt, setting forth that the warden—who, as he had shown by the letters added to his signature, was fuming at the repeal of the Perpetual Edict—had, from hatred against William of Orange, hired an assassin to deliver the new Republic of its new Stadtholder; and he, Tyckelaer was the person thus chosen; but that, horrified at the bare idea of the act which he was asked to perpetrate, he had preferred rather to reveal the crime than to commit it."
"这一消息的披露，确实在奥兰治派间掀起了狂风骤雨。一六七二年八月十六日，首席监察官派人逮捕了科尔内留斯·德维特。于是约翰·德维特的这位贵族兄弟，像最恶劣的罪犯一样，被关进了城里监狱的一间牢房里，将被施以酷刑，那些法官们希望以此让他对自己谋害奥兰治亲王威廉的阴谋供认不讳。","This disclosure was, indeed, well calculated to call forth a furious outbreak among the Orange faction.The Attorney General caused, on the 16th of August, 1672, Cornelius de Witt to be arrested; and the noble brother of John de Witt had, like the vilest criminal, to undergo, in one of the apartments of the town prison, the preparatory degrees of torture, by means of which his judges expected to force from him the confession of his alleged plot against William of Orange."
"然而，科尔内留斯不仅有大智，而且有大勇。他属于那种宁死不屈的先烈，像先辈们坚守信仰那样固守着他们的政治理念，并能够笑对苦难：当他被绑在受刑架上时，他还用决绝的声音按照韵律节奏背诵着贺拉斯的诗歌《正直而意志坚定的人》的第一节。他什么都不招认，这不仅让他的行刑人精疲力竭，也打消了他们的痴心妄想。","But Cornelius was not only possessed of a great mind, but also of a great heart.He belonged to that race of martyrs who, indissolubly wedded to their political convictions as their ancestors were to their faith, are able to smile on pain: while being stretched on the rack, he recited with a firm voice, and scanning the lines according to measure, the first strophe of the “Justum ac tenacem” of Horace, and, making no confession, tired not only the strength, but even the fanaticism, of his executioners."
"尽管如此，法官还是宣判第克莱尔无罪，与此同时判决科尔内留斯免除一切职务及爵位，承担全部诉讼费用，并被永远驱逐出共和国国境。","The judges, notwithstanding, acquitted Tyckelaer from every charge; at the same time sentencing Cornelius to be deposed from all his offices and dignities; to pay all the costs of the trial; and to be banished from the soil of the Republic for ever."
"对一个清白无辜的公民作出这样的判决确实使民众的激昂情绪得到了满足，然而这些人的利益却是伟大的科尔内留斯·德维特终身奋斗的目标。我们马上会看到，事情远不止如此。","This judgment against not only an innocent, but also a great man, was indeed some gratification to the passions of the people, to whose interests Cornelius de Witt had always devoted himself: but, as we shall soon see, it was not enough."
"雅典人因忘恩负义而声名狼藉，但在这一点上，荷兰人比他们更胜一筹。至少，雅典人只把阿里斯蒂德驱逐出去就满足了。","The Athenians, who indeed have left behind them a pretty tolerable reputation for ingratitude, have in this respect to yield precedence to the Dutch.They, at least in the case of Aristides, contented themselves with banishing him."
"一听到自己的哥哥被指控，约翰·德维特就辞去了议长的职位。他也因为尽心于祖国的利益而获得了丰厚的回报，带着众多敌人的仇恨和暗杀者留下的新伤疤归隐。而这通常就是那些为祖国效力而忘了自己利益的老实人的唯一奖赏。","John de Witt, at the first intimation of the charge brought against his brother, had resigned his office of Grand Pensionary.He too received a noble recompense for his devotedness to the best interests of his country, taking with him into the retirement of private life the hatred of a host of enemies, and the fresh scars of wounds inflicted by assassins, only too often the sole guerdon obtained by honest people, who are guilty of having worked for their country, and of having forgotten their own private interests."
"与此同时，奥兰治亲王威廉在职权范围内使尽浑身解数推进事情发展，迫切地等待着时机。他期待着对他顶礼膜拜的民众能够用这两兄弟的身躯铺就他登上总督宝座的台阶。","In the meanwhile William of Orange urged on the course of events by every means in his power, eagerly waiting for the time when the people, by whom he was idolised, should have made of the bodies of the brothers the two steps over which he might ascend to the chair of Stadtholder."
"因此，一六七二年八月二十日，如本章开头所描述的那样，全城的人都涌向布伊坦霍夫，他们要亲眼目睹科尔内留斯·德维特离狱被流放，要看看酷刑在这位熟谙贺拉斯的贵族身上留下了怎样的痕迹。","Thus, then, on the 20th of August, 1672, as we have already stated in the beginning of this chapter, the whole town was crowding towards the Buytenhof, to witness the departure of Cornelius de Witt from prison, as he was going to exile; and to see what traces the torture of the rack had left on the noble frame of the man who knew his Horace so well."
"然而不是所有涌向布伊坦霍夫的人单纯只是为了看看热闹，当中不少人极为活跃，他们想替那些他们认为失职的人履行职责——也就是行刑人的职责。","Yet all this multitude was not crowding to the Buytenhof with the innocent view of merely feasting their eyes with the spectacle; there were many who went there to play an active part in it, and to take upon themselves an office which they conceived had been badly filled,—that of the executioner."
"当然，也有那么一些人是没什么敌意的。他们只关心场面是否宏大，这对民众来说是一贯都有吸引力的，看着曾经的大人物趴在尘土里，他们本能的自豪感得到了满足。","There were, indeed, others with less hostile intentions.All that they cared for was the spectacle, always so attractive to the mob, whose instinctive pride is flattered by it,—the sight of greatness hurled down into the dust."
"他们会说“这个科尔内留斯·德维特不是锒铛入狱，被酷刑折磨垮了吗？我们应该会看到他虚弱苍白、鲜血淋淋、满面羞愧吧？”这对海牙市民来说难道不是一次辉煌的胜利吗？要知道他们的忌妒心比一般民众更甚，恐怕每一个老实巴交的市民都期待着分享这一胜利吧？","“Has not,” they would say, “this Cornelius de Witt been locked up and broken by the rack?Shall we not see him pale, streaming with blood, covered with shame?”And was not this a sweet triumph for the burghers of the Hague, whose envy even beat that of the common rabble; a triumph in which every honest citizen and townsman might be expected to share?"
"“另外，”那些混迹在人群中的奥兰治派的煽动者暗示着，“另外，在从布伊坦霍夫到城门口的这段路上，难道就没有朝科尔内留斯·德维特扔几把沙土或几个石子儿的好机会吗？他在被暴力所迫的情况下才授权给奥兰治亲王当总督，还打算派人暗杀他呢。”他们希望以此来操纵群众，就像掌控一件既锋利又夯实的器具一样。","“Moreover,” hinted the Orange agitators interspersed through the crowd, whom they hoped to manage like a sharp-edged and at the same time crushing instrument,—“moreover, will there not, from the Buytenhof to the gate of the town, a nice little opportunity present itself to throw some handfuls of dirt, or a few stones, at this Cornelius de Witt, who not only conferred the dignity of Stadtholder on the Prince of Orange merely vi coactus, but who also intended to have him assassinated?”"
"那些极端仇视法国的人也附和道，“那还用说，如果这事真在海牙办成了并且办得漂亮的话，科尔内留斯·德维特根本就不该被流放，一旦流放出去，他就会重新与法国勾结，跟他的无赖弟弟约翰靠着德卢瓦侯爵的接济过日子。”","“Besides which,” the fierce enemies of France chimed in, “if the work were done well and bravely at the Hague, Cornelius would certainly not be allowed to go into exile, where he will renew his intrigues with France, and live with his big scoundrel of a brother, John, on the gold of the Marquis de Louvois.”"
"在这样的心情下，人们自然不会慢慢走，而是疾步跑了，这正是海牙居民急匆匆地赶往布伊坦霍夫的原因。","Being in such a temper, people generally will run rather than walk; which was the reason why the inhabitants of the Hague were hurrying so fast towards the Buytenhof."
"正直的第克莱尔就是跑得最匆忙的一个，这家伙一肚子坏主意，却没盘算好具体该干啥，奥兰治党人簇拥着他前行，就像拥戴一个诚实正直、具有民族荣誉感和基督徒博爱精神的英雄那样。","Honest Tyckelaer, with a heart full of spite and malice, and with no particular plan settled in his mind, was one of the foremost, being paraded about by the Orange party like a hero of probity, national honour, and Christian charity."
"这个无耻之徒运用他卑劣的聪明才智和想象力，添枝加叶地描述着当初科尔内留斯·德维特如何收买他，贿赂他的金额有多少，以及为他第克莱尔谋杀亲王扫除障碍而事先设下的所有阴谋诡计。　","This daring miscreant detailed, with all the embellishments and flourishes suggested by his base mind and his ruffianly imagination, the attempts which he pretended Cornelius de Witt had made to corrupt him; the sums of money which were promised, and all the diabolical stratagems planned beforehand to smooth for him, Tyckelaer, all the difficulties in the path of murder."
"百姓们热切地听着他的演讲，他的每一句话都激起民众拥护奥兰治亲王的热情欢呼和盲目憎恨德维特兄弟的不满和诅咒。","And every phase of his speech, eagerly listened to by the populace, called forth enthusiastic cheers for the Prince of Orange, and groans and imprecations of blind fury against the brothers De Witt."
"民众甚至开始把怒气撒到法官身上，他们痛骂法官不公平，让坏人科尔内留斯这样一个恶贯满盈的罪犯就这么走了，太便宜他了。","The mob even began to vent its rage by inveighing against the iniquitous judges, who had allowed such a detestable criminal as the villain Cornelius to get off so cheaply."
"一些煽动者窃窃私语道：“他会走的，他会从我们手里逃走的！”","Some of the agitators whispered, “He will be off, he will escape from us!”"
"又有人接过话说：“一艘船在什文宁根等着他咧，一艘法国船。第克莱尔还看见那船了。”","Others replied, “A vessel is waiting for him at Schevening, a French craft.Tyckelaer has seen her.”"
"“正直的第克莱尔！第克莱尔，好样的！”民众齐声喊道。","“Honest Tyckelaer! Hurrah for Tyckelaer!” the mob cried in chorus."
"“我们别忘了，”人群里一个声音喊道，“同时和科尔内留斯一块儿逃走的还有他的兄弟约翰，这两个无耻的卖国贼。”","“And let us not forget,” a voice exclaimed from the crowd, “that at the same time with Cornelius his brother John, who is as rascally a traitor as himself, will likewise make his escape.”"
"“这两个混蛋在法国会花我们的钱寻欢作乐，他们是把我们的船、兵工厂和造船厂卖给了路易十四换来的钱。”","“And the two rogues will in France make merry with our money, with the money for our vessels, our arsenals, and our dockyards, which they have sold to Louis XIV.”"
"“那咱们就别让他们走！”一个比其他人更激动的爱国者建议道。","“Well, then, don’t let us allow them to depart!” advised one of the patriots who had gained the start of the others."
"“上监狱去，去监狱！”人群重复道。","“Forward to the prison, to the prison!” echoed the crowd."
"叫喊声中，市民从四面八方汇集，越跑越快，架着火枪，挥舞着斧头，一副天不怕地不怕的模样。","Amid these cries, the citizens ran along faster and faster, cocking their muskets, brandishing their hatchets, and looking death and defiance in all directions."
"然而，目前尚未引发任何暴力事件，一列骑兵按兵不动，沉着冷静地守护着布伊坦霍夫的入口，他们的镇静比民众的叫嚷、煽动和威胁更有威慑力。马背上的士兵们在他们长官的注视下如雕塑般纹丝不动，这个海牙骑兵队队长蒂莉伯爵拔剑出鞘，却剑锋朝下，抵着马镫。","No violence, however, had as yet been committed; and the file of horsemen who were guarding the approaches of the Buytenhof remained cool, unmoved, silent, much more threatening in their impassibility than all this crowd of burghers, with their cries, their agitation, and their threats.The men on their horses, indeed, stood like so many statues, under the eye of their chief, Count Tilly, the captain of the mounted troops of the Hague, who had his sword drawn, but held it with its point downwards, in a line with the straps of his stirrup."
"不仅乱哄哄的暴民被这支部队——监狱唯一的防御力量——给震住了，它的那种镇静把派遣到监狱对面帮助士兵维持秩序的民兵护卫队都慑服了，他们继而带领着那群暴民煽动性地呼喊：","This troop, the only defence of the prison, overawed by its firm attitude not only the disorderly riotous mass of the populace, but also the detachment of the burgher guard, which, being placed opposite the Buytenhof to support the soldiers in keeping order, gave to the rioters the example of seditious cries, shouting,—"
"“奥兰治万岁！打倒卖国贼！”","“Hurrah for Orange!Down with the traitors!”"
"蒂莉和他的骑兵在场有益于抑制那些民兵的情绪，但那些民兵却逐渐在自己的叫喊声中变得越来越愤怒，因为他们没法理解一个人如果不喊不叫怎么彰显自己的勇气，他们认为骑兵沉默是懦弱的表现，于是他们领着骚乱的人群向监狱逼近了一步。","The presence of Tilly and his horsemen, indeed, exercised a salutary check on these civic warriors; but by degrees they waxed more and more angry by their own shouts, and as they were not able to understand how any one could have courage without showing it by cries, they attributed the silence of the dragoons to pusillanimity, and advanced one step towards the prison, with all the turbulent mob following in their wake."
"这时，蒂莉伯爵单枪匹马地迎向人群，他举起剑，紧锁眉头，问道：","In this moment, Count Tilly rode forth towards them single-handed, merely lifting his sword and contracting his brow whilst he addressed them:—"
"“那么，民兵护卫队的先生们，你们冲上前是为了什么，你们想要什么？”","“Well, gentlemen of the burgher guard, what are you advancing for, and what do you wish?”"
"市民们挥着他们的火枪，重复着他们的口号：","The burghers shook their muskets, repeating their cry,—"
"“奥兰治万岁！处死卖国贼！”","“Hurrah for Orange!Death to the traitors!”"
"“‘奥兰治万岁！’，这没错！”蒂莉回答道，“大家开心当然好了，我可不想看到有人哭丧着脸。‘处死卖国贼！’，如果你们喊这口号只是想表达你们的愿望，那就随你们喊吧。但是如果你们真的要杀死他们，我会阻止你们的，我一定会阻止的。”","“‘Hurrah for Orange!’ all well and good!” replied Tilly, “although I certainly am more partial to happy faces than to gloomy ones.‘Death to the traitors!’ as much of it as you like, as long as you show your wishes only by cries.But, as to putting them to death in good earnest, I am here to prevent that, and I shall prevent it.”"
"他说罢，回过头去，对手下的士兵下达了命令：","Then, turning round to his men, he gave the word of command,—"
"“弟兄们，准备射击！”","“Soldiers, ready!”"
"骑兵们精准地执行命令，吓得民兵护卫队和群众立刻慌乱地向后退，看到这一幕，骑兵长官的嘴角浮现了微笑。","The troopers obeyed orders with a precision which immediately caused the burgher guard and the people to fall back, in a degree of confusion which excited the smile of the cavalry officer."
"“听着！”他用他那一行人特有的嘲弄语气喊道，“先生们，放轻松些，我的士兵们不会开枪的，但是，你们也甭想向监狱踏近一步。”","“Holloa!” he exclaimed, with that bantering tone which is peculiar to men of his profession; “be easy, gentlemen, my soldiers will not fire a shot; but, on the other hand, you will not advance by one step towards the prison.”"
"“先生，你可知道我们是有火枪的！”民兵护卫队的指挥官不满地喊道。","“And do you know, sir, that we have muskets?” roared the commandant of the burghers."
"“我当然知道了，你们拿着枪在我眼前晃得够多了。不过拜托你们瞧仔细了，我们这边使的可是手枪，手枪的射程可是惊人的五十码，你们离我们却只有二十五码。","“I must know it, by Jove, you have made them glitter enough before my eyes; but I beg you to observe also that we on our side have pistols, that the pistol carries admirably to a distance of fifty yards, and that you are only twenty-five from us.”"
"“处死卖国贼！”被激怒的市民喊道。","“Death to the traitors!” cried the exasperated burghers."
"“得了吧，”军官咆哮道，“喊来喊去总是那一套。真烦人。”","“Go along with you,” growled the officer, “you always cry the same thing over again.It is very tiresome.”"
"说着，他归位回到队伍前面，布伊坦霍夫周围越来越混乱。","With this, he took his post at the head of his troops, whilst the tumult grew fiercer and fiercer about the Buytenhof."
"然而，愤怒的群众不知道，就在他们嗅着其中一只猎物的气息赶到监狱的时候，另一只猎物在人群和骑兵身后不到一百码远的地方经过，来到了布伊坦霍夫监狱，像是迫不及待地要自投罗网。","And yet the fuming crowd did not know that, at that very moment when they were tracking the scent of one of their victims, the other, as if hurrying to meet his fate, passed, at a distance of not more than a hundred yards, behind the groups of people and the dragoons, to betake himself to the Buytenhof."
"事实上约翰·德维特已经带着他的随从下了马车，悄悄穿过了监狱的庭院。","John de Witt, indeed, had alighted from his coach with his servant, and quietly walked across the courtyard of the prison."
"虽然监狱看守认识他，他还是通报了自己的身份，他说：","Mentioning his name to the turnkey, who however knew him, he said,—"
"“早上好，格里弗斯。我是来接我哥哥的，你知道的，他被流放了，我来把他带出城。”","“Good morning, Gryphus; I am coming to take away my brother, who, as you know, is condemned to exile, and to carry him out of the town.”"
"于是，看守跟约翰打了声招呼便让他进去了，随手又把门锁上，他就像马戏团的熊，是被训练来开关监狱大门的。","Whereupon the jailer, a sort of bear, trained to lock and unlock the gates of the prison, had greeted him and admitted him into the building, the doors of which were immediately closed again."
"朝前走了十码，约翰·德维特碰见一个年轻漂亮的姑娘，十七八岁的样子，穿着弗里斯兰妇女的民族服饰，端庄地行了一个屈膝礼。他抚弄着她的下巴，对她说：","Ten yards farther on, John de Witt met a lovely young girl, of about seventeen or eighteen, dressed in the national costume of the Frisian women, who, with pretty demureness, dropped a courtesy to him.Chucking her under the chin, he said to her,—"
"“早上好，我美丽的好罗莎，我哥哥好吗？”","“Good morning, my good and fair Rosa; how is my brother?”"
"“啊，约翰先生，”姑娘答道，“我倒不担心他已经遭受的伤害。这一切现在都结束了。”","“Oh, Mynheer John!” the young girl replied, “I am not afraid of the harm which has been done to him.That’s all over now.”"
"“那你担心什么呢？”","“But what is it you are afraid of?”"
"“我担心他们即将给他的伤害。”","“I am afraid of the harm which they are going to do to him.”"
"“是啊，”德维特说，“你指下面那群人，对吧？”","“Oh, yes,” said De Witt, “you mean to speak of the people down below, don’t you?”"
"“你听见他们的话了吗？”","“Do you hear them?”"
"“他们现在是很激动，不过，他们看见我们时也许会平静些，毕竟我们为他们办的都是好事。”","“They are indeed in a state of great excitement; but when they see us perhaps they will grow calmer, as we have never done them anything but good.”"
"“遗憾的是，这不是理由，事实恰好相反。”姑娘低声说，看见她父亲的命令手势，她走开了。","“That’s unfortunately no reason, except for the contrary,” muttered the girl, as, on an imperative sign from her father, she withdrew."
"“是的，孩子，你说得挺对。”","“Indeed, child, what you say is only too true.”"
"随后，他边走边自言自语：","Then, in pursuing his way, he said to himself,—"
"“这个小姑娘很可能不识字，因此她肯定也没读过书，但她却用一句话概括了世界的整个历史。”","“Here is a damsel who very likely does not know how to read, who consequently has never read anything, and yet with one word she has just told the whole history of the world.”"
"同刚刚踏进监狱的那一刻一样，前议长约翰还是那么镇定自若，只是脸上多了些忧伤；他径直朝他哥哥的牢房走去。","And with the same calm mien, but more melancholy than he had been on entering the prison, the Grand Pensionary proceeded towards the cell of his brother."
"第二章 患难兄弟","Chapter 2 The Two Brothers"
"美丽的罗莎预感到会有不祥之事发生；她说对了，事情真的发生了。当约翰·德维特沿着蜿蜒狭窄的楼梯到他哥哥科尔内留斯的牢房去时，市民们正想方设法地赶走拦住他们去路的蒂莉的军队。","As the fair Rosa, with foreboding doubt, had foretold, so it happened.Whilst John de Witt was climbing the narrow winding stairs which led to the prison of his brother Cornelius, the burghers did their best to have the troop of Tilly, which was in their way, removed."
"看到这种倾向，民众头目非常欣赏自己亲爱的民兵护卫队这种值得赞美的意图，他激昂地呼喊：","Seeing this disposition, King Mob, who fully appreciated the laudable intentions of his own beloved militia, shouted most lustily,—"
"“市民万岁！”","“Hurrah for the burghers!”"
"蒂莉伯爵呢，既坚决又谨慎，在骑兵们的扛枪保护下，他开始与市民和谈，跟这群勇敢的市民们解释国会给他下的命令：他和三个连队必须守住监狱和监狱入口。","As to Count Tilly, who was as prudent as he was firm, he began to parley with the burghers, under the protection of the cocked pistols of his dragoons, explaining to the valiant townsmen, that his order from the States commanded him to guard the prison and its approaches with three companies."
"“为什么会下这样的命令？为什么要守住监狱？”奥兰治派嚷嚷着。","“Wherefore such an order?Why guard the prison?” cried the Orangists."
"“安静，”伯爵答道，“你们一下子问我这么多，我没法儿回答。上级让我‘守住监狱’，我只有遵循命令。先生们，你们自己差不多就是军人，你们清楚军令不可违。”","“Stop,” replied the Count, “there you at once ask me more than I can tell you.I was told, ‘Guard the prison,’ and I guard it.You, gentlemen, who are almost military men yourselves, you are aware that an order must never be gainsaid.”"
"“但是他们给你的这个命令会让那两个叛徒从城里逃走。”","“But this order has been given to you that the traitors may be enabled to leave the town.”"
"“那当然，因为他们被判处流放了。”蒂莉回答。","“Very possibly, as the traitors are condemned to exile,” replied Tilly."
"“谁下的命令？”","“But who has given this order?”"
"“自然是国会了！”","“The States, to be sure!”"
"“国会是叛徒。”","“The States are traitors.”"
"“这个我毫不知情了！”","“I don’t know anything about that!”"
"“你自己就是叛徒！”","“And you are a traitor yourself!”"
"“我？”“是的，就是你。”","“I?”“Yes, you.”"
"“这样吧，先生们，关于这点我们还是互相体谅一下。我能背叛谁？国会吗？我当然不会背叛国会，怎么说我也是拿他们发的军饷，拿了钱我就得效命。”","“Well, as to that, let us understand each other gentlemen.Whom should I betray?The States?Why, I cannot betray them, whilst, being in their pay, I faithfully obey their orders.”"
"伯爵的理由很充分，无从辩驳，群众只有用变本加厉的喧闹和威胁来回应，对此伯爵彬彬有礼地应对着。","As the Count was so indisputably in the right that it was impossible to argue against him, the mob answered only by redoubled clamour and horrible threats, to which the Count opposed the most perfect urbanity."
"“先生们，”他说，“把你们火枪的扳机退回来吧，要是当中哪支不小心走火了，又碰巧伤到我的人，我们可要放倒你们几百个。到时候我们很遗憾，你们更遗憾，特别是这样的事我们谁都不希望发生。”","“Gentlemen,” he said, “uncock your muskets, one of them may go off by accident; and if the shot chanced to wound one of my men, we should knock over a couple of hundreds of yours, for which we should, indeed, be very sorry, but you even more so; especially as such a thing is neither contemplated by you nor by myself.”"
"“你要是这么做，”市民叫嚣着，“我们就一枪崩了你。”","“If you did that,” cried the burghers, “we should have a pop at you, too.”"
"“你们当然可以打死我，但是你们想想，就算你们把我们都干掉了又怎样，我们杀了的人也不会再活过来。”","“Of course you would; but suppose you killed every man Jack of us, those whom we should have killed would not, for all that, be less dead.”"
"“那你就给我们闪开，闪开你就尽了一个好公民应尽的义务。”","“Then leave the place to us, and you will perform the part of a good citizen.”"
"“首先我想声明，”伯爵说，“我不是普通公民，而是军官，这是两码事；其次，我不是荷兰人，而是法国人，这就更不一样了。我只认给我发军饷的国会，要我闪开，就给我看国会的命令，命令拿来了，我即刻掉头，我在这儿也呆腻味了。”","“First of all,” said the Count, “I am not a citizen, but an officer, which is a very different thing; and secondly, I am not a Hollander, but a Frenchman, which is more different still.I have to do with no one but the States, by whom I am paid; let me see an order from them to leave the place to you, and I shall only be too glad to wheel off in an instant, as I am confoundedly bored here.”"
"“没错，没错！”上百个人喊道，立刻又有五百个人附和，“去市政厅，去见议员！赶紧了！快走！”","“Yes, yes!” cried a hundred voices; the din of which was immediately swelled by five hundred others; “let us march to the Town-hall; let us go and see the deputies!Come along! Come along!”"
"“这就对了，”蒂莉望着人群中最凶暴的人走开了，嘀咕着，“上市政厅请求干坏事，瞧好了吧，看他们会不会答应。走吧，兄弟们！”","“That’s it,” Tilly muttered between his teeth, as he saw the most violent among the crowd turning away; “go and ask for a meanness at the Town-hall, and you will see whether they will grant it; go, my fine fellows, go!”"
"这位可敬的军官信赖行政长官们的品行，而行政长官们又指望他能恪守军人的品德。","The worthy officer relied on the honour of the magistrates, who, on their side, relied on his honour as a soldier."
"“队长，我说，”第一中尉跟伯爵耳语，“我倒是希望议员会断然拒绝这群疯子，但要是他们能给我们派点儿援兵，这也不是什么坏事。”","“I say, Captain,” the first lieutenant whispered into the ear of the Count, “I hope the deputies will give these madmen a flat refusal; but, after all, it would do no harm if they would send us some reinforcement.”"
"与此同时，刚刚我们说到的约翰·德维特在同监狱看守格里弗斯及其女儿罗莎交谈后，爬梯上楼，现在已经来到牢房门口。他的哥哥科尔内留斯，饱受预审酷刑的折磨，正躺在褥垫上休息。流放的判决一宣告，他们就没理由再严刑拷打了。","In the meanwhile, John de Witt, whom we left climbing the stairs, after the conversation with the jailer Gryphus and his daughter Rosa, had reached the door of the cell, where on a mattress his brother Cornelius was resting, after having undergone the preparatory degrees of the torture.The sentence of banishment having been pronounced, there was no occasion for inflicting the torture extraordinary."
"科尔内留斯躺在床上，腕部折了，手指也断了。尽管如此，他没有承认自己没有犯过的罪行；而现在，三天的痛苦煎熬后，当他得知原以为会判他死刑的法官只判决他流放，他终于又能松一口气了。","Cornelius was stretched on his couch, with broken wrists and crushed fingers.He had not confessed a crime of which he was not guilty; and now, after three days of agony, he once more breathed freely, on being informed that the judges, from whom he had expected death, were only condemning him to exile."
"他生就一副铮铮铁骨和一颗坚毅勇敢的心。他的敌人要是在布伊坦霍夫漆黑的牢房里看到他惨白的脸上还挂着笑容会多失望啊，那分明是瞥见天堂荣耀，忘却尘世污秽的殉道者才会有的笑容。","Endowed with an iron frame and a stout heart, how would he have disappointed his enemies if they could only have seen, in the dark cell of the Buytenhof, his pale face lit up by the smile of the martyr, who forgets the dross of this earth after having obtained a glimpse of the bright glory of heaven."
"事实上，监视官科尔内留斯已经完全恢复了体力，这很大程度上归功于他自己的强大意志，而不是实际的帮助。他正盘算着按照冗杂的法律程序，他还要在监狱里呆多久。","The warden, indeed, had already recovered his full strength, much more owing to the force of his own strong will than to actual aid; and he was calculating how long the formalities of the law would still detain him in prison."
"也正是这一时刻，民兵护卫队和民众人声鼎沸，怒气冲冲地要置两兄弟于死地，威胁着保护他们的蒂莉队长。监狱围墙外的咆哮怒号声，犹如惊涛拍岸，现在传到了囚犯的耳里。","This was just at the very moment when the mingled shouts of the burgher guard and of the mob were raging against the two brothers, and threatening Captain Tilly, who served as a rampart to them.This noise, which roared outside of the walls of the prison, as the surf dashing against the rocks, now reached the ears of the prisoner."
"尽管吵闹声听起来很吓人，但科尔内留斯看起来并不想打听原委，也懒得站起来朝狭小的铁窗外眺望一下，光线和外界的喧闹就是从那扇窗户传进来的。","But, threatening as it sounded, Cornelius appeared not to deem it worth his while to inquire after its cause; nor did he get up to look out of the narrow grated window, which gave access to the light and to the noise of the world without."
"他专注于那时时刻刻牵扯着他的疼痛，疼痛对他来说几乎成了常态。他感到，他不朽灵魂和他肉体凡胎之间的纽带慢慢松掉了。为此他满心的欢喜，就好像他的精神已经摆脱了肉体的束缚，正漂浮于躯壳之上，犹如即将被扑灭的余烬里窜出的火苗。","He was so absorbed in his never-ceasing pain that it had almost become a habit with him.He felt with such delight the bonds which connected his immortal being with his perishable frame gradually loosening, that it seemed to him as if his spirit, freed from the trammels of the body, were hovering above it, like the expiring flame which rises from the half-extinguished embers."
"他还想起了他弟弟，当他弟弟的形象鲜活地映入他脑海的时候，门开了。约翰进来了，匆匆来到他的床前。他朝他光荣的弟弟伸出伤残的双臂和缠着绷带的双手。他现在已经超越了他弟弟，不是因为为国效力，而是荷兰人对他所怀的仇恨胜过对他弟弟的仇恨。","He also thought of his brother; and whilst the latter was thus vividly present to his mind the door opened, and John entered, hurrying to the bedside of the prisoner, who stretched out his broken limbs and his hands tied up in bandages towards that glorious brother, whom he now excelled, not in services rendered to the country, but in the hatred which the Dutch bore him."
"约翰轻柔地吻着他哥哥的前额，轻轻地把那受伤的手放回到床褥上。","John tenderly kissed his brother on the forehead, and put his sore hands gently back on the mattress."
"“科尔内留斯，我可怜的哥哥，很疼，不是吗？”","“Cornelius, my poor brother, you are suffering great pain, are you not?”"
"“弟弟，一看见你，我就不觉得疼了。”","“I am suffering no longer, since I see you, my brother.”"
"“哎！我可怜的、亲爱的科尔内留斯！看到你这个样子，我真是难受。”","“Oh, my poor dear Cornelius!I feel most wretched to see you in such a state.”"
"“其实我更多想到的是你而不是我自己。他们折磨我的时候，我从没想过吐露一丝抱怨，就是有一次，我说了声，‘可怜的弟弟！’如今你来了，让我们忘掉一切。你是来接我走的，对吗？”","“And, indeed, I have thought more of you than of myself; and whilst they were torturing me, I never thought of uttering a complaint, except once, to say, ‘Poor brother!’But now that you are here, let us forget all.You are coming to take me away, are you not?”"
"“嗯。”","“I am.”"
"“我痊愈得差不多了，扶我站起来，让你看看我可以走路了。”","“I am quite healed; help me to get up, and you shall see how I can walk.”"
"“你不用走多远，我的马车就停在池塘边，就在蒂莉骑兵的后面。”","“You will not have to walk far, as I have my coach near the pond, behind Tilly’s dragoons.”"
"“蒂莉的骑兵！他们到池塘边干嘛？”","“Tilly’s dragoons!What are they near the pond for?”"
"“是这样的，”前议长带着他惯有的忧郁笑容说，“市政厅的先生们认为海牙人会来看你离开，担心会出乱子。”","“Well,” said the Grand Pensionary with a melancholy smile which was habitual to him, “the gentlemen at the Town-hall expect that the people at the Hague would like to see you depart, and there is some apprehension of a tumult.”"
"“出乱子？”科尔内留斯盯着他不知所措的弟弟，问道，“出乱子？”","“Of a tumult?” replied Cornelius, fixing his eyes on his perplexed brother; “a tumult?”"
"“嗯，是的，科尔内留斯。”","“Yes, Cornelius.”"
"“哦！我刚才听到的就是这个了。”犯人说道，好像是在自言自语。接着又转身问他弟弟：","“Oh! that’s what I heard just now,” said the prisoner, as if speaking to himself.Then, turning to his brother, he continued,—"
"“监狱下面是不是有很多人？”","“Are there many persons down before the prison.”"
"“是的，哥哥，有不少。”","“Yes, my brother, there are.”"
"“可这么说来，他们是冲着我来的——”","“But then, to come here to me—”"
"“怎样？”","“Well?”"
"“他们是怎么让你上来的？”","“How is it that they have allowed you to pass?”"
"“科尔内留斯，你很清楚咱们不受欢迎。”议长黯然神伤地说，“我都是抄小道来的。”","“You know well that we are not very popular, Cornelius,” said the Grand Pensionary, with gloomy bitterness.“I have made my way through all sorts of bystreets and alleys.”"
"“约翰，你都不敢抛头露面了吗？”","“You hid yourself, John?”"
"“我想马上赶到你这儿，我只是做了官场上的人都会做的——海上遭遇逆风不也是见风使舵嘛。”","“I wished to reach you without loss of time, and I did what people will do in politics, or on the sea when the wind is against them,—I tacked.”"
"这时，从下面广场传来的喧闹声夹杂着更多的怒火。蒂莉正和他们谈判。","At this moment the noise in the square below was heard to roar with increasing fury.Tilly was parleying with the burghers."
"“是啊，是啊，”科尔内留斯说，“约翰，你是一个技术娴熟的舵手，但我担心你还能不能像你以前一样，率领特罗普舰队从斯凯尔特河的浅滩一路开到安特卫普，在这阵狂风中，在民众仇恨的惊涛骇浪中，安全地把你哥哥从布伊坦霍夫送出去。”","“Well, well,” said Cornelius, “you are a very skilful pilot, John; but I doubt whether you will as safely guide your brother out of the Buytenhof in the midst of this gale, and through the raging surf of popular hatred, as you did the fleet of Van Tromp past the shoals of the Scheldt to Antwerp.”"
"“上帝会帮咱们的，科尔内留斯，我们总得试试吧，”约翰回答到，“不过，我事先得跟你说件事。”","“With the help of God, Cornelius, we’ll at least try,” answered John; “but, first of all, a word with you.”"
"“说吧！”","“Speak!”"
"叫喊声又掀起一轮高潮。","The shouts began anew."
"“听听，”科尔内留斯继续说道，“这些人多愤怒啊！这愤怒是冲着你，还是冲我呢？”","“Hark, hark!” continued Cornelius, “how angry those people are!Is it against you, or against me?”"
"“应该是冲我们俩，科尔内留斯。我跟你说过，我亲爱的哥哥，奥兰治派不仅中伤诽谤我们，还指责我们跟法国谈判。”","“I should say it is against us both, Cornelius.I told you, my dear brother, that the Orange party, while assailing us with their absurd calumnies, have also made it a reproach against us that we have negotiated with France.”"
"“这些白痴！”","“What blockheads they are!”"
"“但他们就是抓住这点不放。”","“But, indeed, they reproach us with it.”"
"可是一旦这些谈判成功了，他们就不会在里斯、奥尔赛、威塞尔和莱茵堡打败仗了，也不会让人家打过莱茵河，荷兰还可以在沼泽和运河中编织着自己不可战胜的神话。","“And yet, if these negotiations had been successful, they would have prevented the defeats of Rees, Orsay, Wesel, and Rheinberg; the Rhine would not have been crossed, and Holland might still consider herself invincible in the midst of her marshes and canals.”"
"“你说的都没错，我亲爱的科尔内留斯，但我更确定的是，如果现在有人发现我们跟德卢瓦侯爵的通信，我这个舵手就是本领再强，也救不了这艘要把德维特兄弟及其财产运出荷兰的脆弱小船。这些信件会向正直的人证明我是多么爱我的国家，为了祖国的自由和荣耀，我作出了怎样的牺牲，但要是这些信件落入奥兰治派之手，我们就完了。　我希望你在离开多特来海牙与我会合前，把这些信给烧了。”","“All this is quite true, my dear Cornelius, but still more certain it is, that if at this moment our correspondence with the Marquis de Louvois were discovered, skilful pilot as I am, I should not be able to save the frail barque which is to carry the brothers De Witt and their fortunes out of Holland.That correspondence, which might prove to honest people how dearly I love my country, and what sacrifices I have offered to make for its liberty and glory, would be ruin to us if it fell into the hands of the Orange party.I hope you have burned the letters before you left Dort to join me at the Hague.”"
"“亲爱的弟弟，”科尔内留斯回答，“你和德卢瓦侯爵的来往信件可以充分证明你是近几年来七省联邦最伟大、最慷慨和最能干的公民。我为祖国的荣誉感到高兴，我更为你的荣誉而欣慰，约翰。信件我已经妥善处理了，说什么也不能烧。”","“My dear brother,” Cornelius answered, “your correspondence with M. de Louvois affords ample proof of your having been of late the greatest, most generous, and most able citizen of the Seven United Provinces.I rejoice in the glory of my country; and particularly do I rejoice in your glory, John.I have taken good care not to burn that correspondence.”"
"“那样的话，这辈子我们是完了，”议长踱向窗口，静静地说。","“Then we are lost, as far as this life is concerned,” quietly said the Grand Pensionary, approaching the window."
"“不，约翰，恰恰相反，我们不仅得拯救自己的生命，还要重获众望。”","“No, on the contrary, John, we shall at the same time save our lives and regain our popularity.”"
"“那这些信件，你怎么处置了？”","“But what have you done with these letters?”"
"我把它们交给我的教子，科尔内留斯·范巴尔莱托管了，你也认识他的，他住在多特。","“I have intrusted them to the care of Cornelius van Baerle, my godson, whom you know, and who lives at Dort.”"
"“可怜的范巴尔莱，这个耿直的孩子！他知识渊博，却只关注花和创造花的上帝。你托付他守住这么重要的秘密，会毁了他的，可怜的孩子！”","“Poor honest Van Baerle!who knows so much, and yet thinks of nothing but of flowers and of God who made them.You have intrusted him with this fatal secret; it will be his ruin, poor soul!”"
"“毁了他？”","“His ruin?”"
"“是啊，不论他坚强或是懦弱。如果他坚强，当他听说了我们的遭遇，他会以与我们相识为豪；倘若他懦弱的话，他会因为与我们的关系而胆怯；如果他坚强，他会大胆地说出秘密；如果他懦弱，他会被人逼着说出秘密。无论哪种情况，他都完了，我们也完了。因此，趁着还有时间，我们赶紧逃吧！”","“Yes, for he will either be strong or he will be weak.If he is strong, he will, when he hears of what has happened to us, boast of our acquaintance; if he is weak, he will be afraid on account of his connection with us: if he is strong, he will betray the secret by his boldness; if he is weak, he will allow it to be forced from him.In either case he is lost, and so are we.Let us, therefore, fly, fly, as long as there is still time.”"
"科尔内留斯·德维特从床榻上起身，握住了他弟弟的手，约翰触碰到亚麻绷带，不禁打了个寒颤。科尔内留斯说：","Cornelius de Witt, raising himself on his couch, and grasping the hand of his brother, who shuddered at the touch of his linen bandages, replied,—"
"“难道我还不了解我的教子吗？难道我还不清楚他脑子里的每一个想法，心里的每一种情愫吗？你问我他是坚强还是懦弱。我看他既不坚强也不懦弱，但现在这不是问题。关键是他一定不会泄露秘密，因为他压根就不知道秘密。”","“Do not I know my godson?have not I been enabled to read every thought in Van Baerle’s mind, and every sentiment in his heart?You ask whether he is strong or weak.He is neither the one nor the other; but that is not now the question.The principal point is, that he is sure not to divulge the secret, for the very good reason that he does not know it himself.”"
"约翰惊讶地转过身。","John turned round in surprise."
"“你应该知道，弟弟，我可是杰出的政治家约翰·德维特一手培养出来的。我再说一遍，范巴尔莱不知道我交他托管的是什么东西，更不清楚那东西的重要性。”","“You must know, my dear brother, that I have been trained in the school of that distinguished politician John de Witt; and I repeat to you, that Van Baerle is not aware of the nature and importance of the deposit which I have intrusted to him.”"
"“那赶快，”约翰大声说道，“趁还有时间，咱们派人给他捎个信儿，让他烧了那包裹。”","“Quick then,” cried John, “as there is still time, let us convey to him directions to burn the parcel.”"
"“派谁？”","“Through whom?”"
"“派我的随从克莱克，他本来要骑马送我们，他和我一块儿进了监狱，来扶你下楼的。”","“Through my servant Craeke, who was to have accompanied us on horseback, and who has entered the prison with me, to assist you downstairs.”"
"“约翰，在烧掉那些珍贵的文件之前，你可得想清楚了！”","“Consider well before having those precious documents burnt, John!”"
"“我首先考虑的，是德维特兄弟一定得活命，才能挽救他们的声誉。倘若我们死了，谁来为我们正名？谁会明白我们的一片苦心呢？”","“I consider, above all things, that the brothers De Witt must necessarily save their lives, to be able to save their character.If we are dead, who will defend us?Who will have fully understood our intentions?”"
"“那你认为他们发现那些信件后会杀了我们吗？”","“You expect, then, that they would kill us if those papers were found?”"
"约翰没有答话，伸手指着广场，就从那儿，就在那一刻传来了狂野的叫喊声。","John, without answering, pointed with his hand to the square, whence, at that very moment, fierce shouts and savage yells made themselves heard."
"“是啊，是啊，”科尔内留斯说，“那些叫喊声我听得一清二楚，可他们想干什么呀？”","“Yes, yes,” said Cornelius, “I hear these shouts very plainly, but what is their meaning?”"
"约翰打开窗户。","John opened the window."
"“处死卖国贼！”民众吼道。","“Death to the traitors!” howled the populace."
"“哥哥，你现在听清了？”","“Do you hear now, Cornelius?”"
"“卖国贼！这是指我们啊！”囚犯仰头望天，耸了耸肩。","“To the traitors! that means us!” said the prisoner, raising his eyes to heaven and shrugging his shoulders."
"“嗯，是指我们。”约翰重复着。","“Yes, it means us,” repeated John."
"“克莱克在哪儿？”","“Where is Craeke?”"
"“应该就在你牢房门外。”","“At the door of your cell, I suppose.”"
"“让他进来。”","“Let him enter then.”"
"约翰打开门，那忠实的随从果然守在门口。","John opened the door; the faithful servant was waiting on the threshold."
"“进来吧，克莱克，仔细听我哥跟你说的话。”","“Come in, Craeke, and mind well what my brother will tell you.”"
"“不，约翰，口信不行。很遗憾，我必须得写封信。","“No, John; it will not suffice to send a verbal message; unfortunately, I shall be obliged to write.”"
"“为啥？”","“And why that?”"
"“因为范巴尔莱没见到专门指示，是决不会交出或烧掉包裹的。”","“Because Van Baerle will neither give up the parcel nor burn it without a special command to do so.”"
"“可是，老兄，你能写字吗？”约翰看着这个不幸的被迫害者那双满是烫伤和瘀青的手问。","“But will you be able to write, poor old fellow?” John asked, with a look on the scorched and bruised hands of the unfortunate sufferer."
"“如果有笔和墨水，你就知道了。”科尔内留斯说。","“If I had pen and ink you would soon see,” said Cornelius."
"“无论如何，还有一支铅笔。”","“Here is a pencil, at any rate.”"
"“你有纸吗？我这儿可什么都没有。”","“Have you any paper?for they have left me nothing.”"
"“喏，这本《圣经》，把扉页撕下来。”","“Here, take this Bible, and tear out the fly-leaf.”"
"“太好了，这个行。”","“Very well, that will do.”"
"“不过你的字迹会很难认。”","“But your writing will be illegible.”"
"“交给我好了，”科尔内留斯说，“行刑的人是折磨得我够呛，但我的手，写那几行必须得写的字，抖都不会抖一下。”","“Just leave me alone for that,” said Cornelius.“The executioners have indeed pinched me badly enough, but my hand will not tremble once in tracing the few lines which are requisite.”"
"科尔内留斯真的拿起笔来写，由于手指捏笔用力，肉里渗出的鲜血浸透了白色亚麻绷带。","And really Cornelius took the pencil and began to write, when through the white linen bandages drops of blood oozed out which the pressure of the fingers against the pencil squeezed from the raw flesh."
"议长的额头上沁着冷汗。","A cold sweat stood on the brow of the Grand Pensionary."
"科尔内留斯写道：","Cornelius wrote:—"
"“亲爱的教子：","“My dear Godson,—"
"“你把我交付给你的包裹烧了。“不要看它，也不要打开，这样你就永远不知道里面的内容了。“这里面的秘密会让任何保管这东西的人丧命。烧了它，你就救了德维特兄弟。","“Burn the parcel which I have intrusted to you.“Burn it without looking at it, and without opening it, so that its contents may for ever remain unknown to yourself.“Secrets of this description are death to those with whom they are deposited.Burn it, and you will have saved John and Cornelius de Witt."
"“再见，爱我。","“Farewell, and love me."
"科尔内留斯·德维特","Cornelius de Witt"
"一六七二年八月二十日。”","“August 20th, 1672.”"
"约翰眼里噙着泪水，抹去沾染在纸上的一滴高贵的血，把纸条交给克莱克，又嘱咐了一番，回到科尔内留斯的身边。科尔内留斯好像剧痛难忍，几近昏厥过去。","John, with tears in his eyes, wiped off a drop of the noble blood which had soiled the leaf, and, after having handed the despatch to Craeke with a last direction, returned to Cornelius, who seemed overcome by intense pain, and near fainting."
"“好了，”约翰说，“要是可靠的克莱克吹响了他的水手哨，就说明他已经穿过人群，到了池塘的另一边。那时候咱们也该动身了。”","“Now,” said he, “when honest Craeke sounds his coxswain’s whistle, it will be a signal of his being clear of the crowd, and of his having reached the other side of the pond.And then it will be our turn to depart.”"
"不到五分钟，一声长而尖锐的哨声响过，那声音压过了布伊坦霍夫广场的喧闹嘈杂。","Five minutes had not elapsed, before a long and shrill whistle was heard through the din and noise of the square of the Buytenhof."
"约翰充满感激地仰望天空。","John gratefully raised his eyes to heaven."
"“好了，”他说，“咱们走吧，科尔内留斯。”","“And now,” said he, “let us off, Cornelius.”"
"第三章 约翰·德维特的学生","Chapter 3 The Pupil of John de Witt"
"布伊坦霍夫广场的喧闹声，一浪高过一浪，越来越威胁到两兄弟的生命。约翰因此决定得赶快带哥哥科尔内留斯离开。与此同时，市民代表团已经在去市政厅的路上，他们要求撤走蒂莉的骑兵。","Whilst the clamour of the crowd in the square of Buytenhof, which grew more and more menacing against the two brothers, determined John de Witt to hasten the departure of his brother Cornelius, a deputation of burghers had gone to the Town-hall to demand the withdrawal of Tilly’s horse."
"从布伊坦霍夫到市政厅所在的荷格斯特莱特（主街）并不远。一个陌生的面孔，从一开始就兴致盎然地关注着事情的始末，这时候和其他人一起，准确地说是跟着人群朝市政厅走去，这样就能尽早打听到目前的最新消息。","It was not far from the Buytenhof to Hoogstraet (High Street); and a stranger, who since the beginning of this scene had watched all its incidents with intense interest, was seen to wend his way with, or rather in the wake of, the others towards the Town-hall, to hear as soon as possible the current news of the hour."
"陌生人很年轻，不过二十二三岁的光景，但看不出他蕴藏着什么活力。他显然有足够的理由不想让别人认出他，因为他用精细的弗里斯兰亚麻手绢挡住了脸，不时地还用它擦着额头的汗珠和滚烫的嘴唇。","This stranger was a very young man, of scarcely twenty-two or three, with nothing about him that bespoke any great energy.He evidently had his good reasons for not making himself known, as he hid his face in a handkerchief of fine Frisian linen, with which he incessantly wiped his brow or his burning lips."
"他的目光如此敏锐，犹如猛禽——长长的鹰钩鼻，棱角分明，总是微张的嘴就像咧开的伤口——要是拉瓦特尔还活在那时代的话，这人一定是拉瓦特尔相面观察的范本，替他看相，一开始都说不出啥好话。","With an eye keen as that of a bird of prey,—with a long aquiline nose, a finely cut mouth, which he generally kept open, or rather which was gaping like the edges of a wound,—this man would have presented to Lavater, if Lavater had lived at that time, a subject for physiognomical observations which at the first blush would not have been very favourable to the person in question."
"“征服者和海盗的面相有何差别？”古人问。他们的差别仅在于鹰和秃鹫之间差别——一个安详，一个焦躁。","“What difference is there between the figure of the conqueror and that of the pirate?” said the ancients.The difference only between the eagle and the vulture,—serenity or restlessness."
"的确，这个陌生人蜡黄的面孔，单薄孱弱的身体，鬼鬼祟祟的举止，正是多疑的主子或是不安的小偷的典型。这个神秘人物如此煞费苦心地遮掩自己，要是警察，一定会怀疑他是小偷。","And indeed the sallow physiognomy, the thin and sickly body, and the prowling ways of the stranger, were the very type of a suspecting master, or an unquiet thief; and a police officer would certainly have decided in favour of the latter supposition, on account of the great care which the mysterious person evidently took to hide himself."
"他穿着朴素，明显没带武器，胳膊纤长结实，手虽干燥，但有着贵族的白皙和精致，他倚着一个军官的肩膀。军官握着剑，热切而好奇地关注着布伊坦霍夫广场上发生一切——对一个军人来说，这不足为奇——直到他的同伴把他拉开了。","He was plainly dressed, and apparently unarmed; his arm was lean but wiry, and his hands dry, but of an aristocratic whiteness and delicacy, and he leaned on the shoulder of an officer, who, with his hand on his sword, had watched the scenes in the Buytenhof with eager curiosity, very natural in a military man, until his companion drew him away with him."
"一到荷格斯特莱特广场，那个脸色蜡黄的人就推着他的同伴来到一扇开着的护窗板后，并开始从那里观察市政厅的阳台。","On arriving at the square of the Hoogstraet, the man with the sallow face pushed the other behind an open shutter, from which corner he himself began to survey the balcony of the Town-hall."
"在民众猛烈的叫喊声中，市政厅的窗户开了，一个人走出来同民众讲话。","At the savage yells of the mob, the window of the Town-hall opened, and a man came forth to address the people."
"“阳台上那人是谁？”年轻人瞟了一眼说话人，问道。","“Who is that on the balcony?” asked the young man, glancing at the orator."
"“议员鲍维尔特。”军官回答。","“It is the Deputy Bowelt,” replied the officer."
"“他这人怎样？你了解他吗？”","“What sort of a man is he?Do you know anything of him?”"
"“一个正直的人，至少我这么认为的，殿下。”","“An honest man; at least I believe so, Monseigneur.”"
"听到军官如此评价鲍维尔特的为人，年轻人居然很失望，不满之情溢于言表。军官见此不得不补充说道：","Hearing this character given of Bowelt, the young man showed signs of such a strange disappointment and evident dissatisfaction that the officer could not but remark it, and therefore added,—"
"“至少人们都这么说，殿下。对此我不能发表任何看法，因为我同鲍维尔特先生并无私交。”","“At least people say so, Monseigneur.I cannot say anything about it myself, as I have no personal acquaintance with Mynheer Bowelt.”"
"“一个正直的人，”那个被称为殿下的人重复着这几个字；“你的意思是说他正直（brave homme)呢，还是勇敢(homme brave)？”","“An honest man,” repeated he who was addressed as Monseigneur; “do you mean to say that he is an honest man (brave homme), or a brave one (homme brave)?”"
"“啊，请殿下原谅，对于他是什么样的人，我不敢妄下论断，我再次向殿下保证，我跟他只是会过面，并无交往。”","“Ah, Monseigneur must excuse me; I would not presume to draw such a fine distinction in the case of a man whom, I assure your Highness once more, I know only by sight.”"
"“如果这个鲍维尔特是个正直的人，”殿下继续说道，“他不会答应这群愤怒的请愿者的要求的。”","“If this Bowelt is an honest man,” his Highness continued, “he will give to the demand of these furibund petitioners a very queer reception.”"
"他的手在他同伴的肩上紧张地颤抖着，像大键琴琴键上演奏者的手指。这泄露了他那冰冷严峻的面孔有时也掩盖不住的焦躁，尤其是在那一刻。","The nervous quiver of his hand, which moved on the shoulder of his companion as the fingers of a player on the keys of a harpsichord, betrayed his burning impatience, so ill concealed at certain times, and particularly at that moment, under the icy and sombre expression of his face."
"此时，市民代表团的负责人正质询鲍维尔特先生，要求他告知他的同僚，也就是其他议员的去处。","The chief of the deputation of the burghers was then heard addressing an interpellation to Mynheer Bowelt, whom he requested to let them know where the other deputies, his colleagues, were."
"“先生们，”鲍维尔特再次强调，“我向大家保证，现在只有达斯佩朗先生同我一块儿，我不能擅作任何决议。”","“Gentlemen,” Bowelt repeated for the second time, “I assure you that in this moment I am here alone with Mynheer d’Asperen, and I cannot take any resolution on my own responsibility.”"
"“命令！我们要命令！”几千号人喊道。","“The order! we want the order!” cried several thousand voices."
"鲍维尔特先生想说点儿什么，可根本听不见他说了啥，只见他挥舞着他的胳膊，做出各种手势，显然，他对此局势已无能为力了。最后，当他清楚自己没法让大家听见自己说话时，就转身向开着的窗户喊达斯佩朗先生过来。　","Mynheer Bowelt wished to speak, but his words were not heard, and he was only seen moving his arms in all sorts of gestures, which plainly showed that he felt his position to be desperate.When, at last, he saw that he could not make himself heard, he turned round towards the open window, and called Mynheer d’Asperen."
"达斯佩朗先生在阳台上露了面，迎接他的是群众热烈的呼喊声，那呼喊声比十分钟前迎接鲍维尔特先生的更为有力。","The latter gentleman now made his appearance on the balcony, where he was saluted with shouts even more energetic than those with which, ten minutes before, his colleague had been received."
"当然，这并不会阻止达斯佩朗先生在民众前高谈阔论一番，尽管这项任务在目前的形势下十分艰巨。但是民众更希望向国会卫兵施压——虽然卫兵并未阻碍这些闹革命的群众——而不是听达斯佩朗先生在这里演讲。","This did not prevent him from undertaking the difficult task of haranguing the mob; but the mob preferred forcing the guard of the States—which, however, offered no resistance to the sovereign people—to listening to the speech of Mynheer d’Asperen."
"当群众涌向市政厅的大门时，“看现在的形势，”年轻人冷冷地评价道，“问题会在里面解决了，上尉。走，咱们去听听。”","“Now, then,” the young man coolly remarked, whilst the crowd was rushing into the principal gate of the Town-hall, “it seems the question will be discussed indoors, Captain.Come along, and let us hear the debate.”"
"“啊，殿下！殿下！当心啊！”","“Oh, Monseigneur! Monseigneur! take care!”"
"“当心什么？”","“Of what?”"
"“这些议员中，不少人都跟您打过交道，只要其中一个认出殿下就麻烦了。”","“Among these deputies there are many who have had dealings with you, and it would be sufficient, that one of them should recognize your Highness.”"
"“是啊，我可能被指控煽动这一切，你说得对，”年轻人说，为自己表现得太迫切而后悔羞愧了好一会儿。“从这儿我们就能看到他们出来时，是否能拿到撤走骑兵的命令，这样我们就能判断鲍维尔特先生是正直还是勇敢了。”","“Yes, that I might be charged with having been the instigator of all this work, indeed, you are right,” said the young man, blushing for a moment from regret of having betrayed so much eagerness.“From this place we shall see them return with or without the order for the withdrawal of the dragoons, then we may judge which is greater, Mynheer Bowelt’s honesty or his courage.”"
"“可是，”军官惊讶地望着眼前这个他称为殿下的人，回答，“可是殿下，想必您从来都不会认为议员们会命令蒂莉的骑兵撤走的，对吗？”","“But,” replied the officer, looking with astonishment at the personage whom he addressed as Monseigneur, “but your Highness surely does not suppose for one instant that the deputies will order Tilly’s horse to quit their post?”"
"“为什么不呢？”年轻人轻声反驳道。","“Why not?” the young man quietly retorted."
"“因为这么做简直就意味着签署了判德·维特兄弟死刑的文件。”","“Because doing so would simply be signing the death warrant of Cornelius and John de Witt.”"
"“我们会看到，”殿下冷漠淡然地说，“只有上帝才知道这些人心里想什么。”","“We shall see,” his Highness replied, with the most perfect coolness; “God alone knows what is going on within the hearts of men.”"
"军官斜睨着自己同伴那张无动于衷的脸，脸色变得苍白：他是一个既勇敢又正直的人。","The officer looked askance at the impassible figure of his companion, and grew pale: he was an honest man as well as a brave one."
"殿下和他的随从就在他们所站的位置，听到人群的吵闹声和踩踏市政厅楼梯的脚步声。嘈杂声随即从大厅的窗户传出，先前鲍维尔特和达斯佩朗先生曾出现在这个大厅的阳台上。这两位先生已经躲到里面去了，很可能是因为担心迫于群众的压力，被挤下阳台栏杆。","From the spot where they stood, his Highness and his attendant heard the tumult and the heavy tramp of the crowd on the staircase of the Town-hall.The noise thereupon sounded through the windows of the hall, on the balcony of which Mynheers Bowelt and D’Asperen had presented themselves.These two gentlemen had retired into the building, very likely from fear of being forced over the balustrade by the pressure of the crowd."
"此后，窗户上不停掠过一片喧闹混乱中来回走动的人影：议会厅挤满了人。","After this, fluctuating shadows in tumultuous confusion were seen flitting to and fro across the windows: the council hall was filling."
"忽然吵闹声平息下来，跟着人群仿佛又炸开了锅，吵得比先前更厉害，后来简直连老建筑的房顶都快被掀了。","Suddenly the noise subsided, and as suddenly again it rose with redoubled intensity, and at last reached such a pitch that the old building shook to the very roof."
"最后，人流穿过走廊、楼梯，涌向拱形大门，从大门涌出的人群就如同喷泉喷涌而出的汩汩水流。","At length, the living stream poured back through the galleries and stairs to the arched gateway, from which it was seen issuing like waters from a spout."
"一个人跑在第一批队伍的前面，与其说是跑，还不如说他在飞。他魔鬼般地笑着，脸都扭曲变形了，让人觉得面目可憎：这个人就是外科医生第克莱尔。","At the head of the first group, man was flying rather than running, his face hideously distorted with satanic glee: this man was the surgeon Tyckelaer."
"“我们拿到了！我们拿到了！”他叫喊着，一边挥舞着一张纸。","“We have it! we have it!” he cried, brandishing a paper in the air."
"“他们拿到命令了！”军官惊愕地咕哝着。","“They have got the order!” muttered the officer in amazement."
"“哦，这么说，”殿下淡淡地说，“关于鲍维尔特先生是正直还是勇敢，我想现在也可以得出结论了：他既不正直也不勇敢。”","“Well, then,” his Highness quietly remarked, “now I know what to believe with regard to Mynheer Bowelt’s honesty and courage: he has neither the one nor the other.”"
"然后，他的视线一直跟随着从他前面跑过的人群，继续说道：","Then, looking with a steady glance after the crowd which was rushing along before him, he continued,—"
"“我们去布伊坦霍夫吧，上尉。我想一场好戏正等着我们呢。”","“Let us now go to the Buytenhof, Captain; I expect we shall see a very strange sight there.”"
"军官鞠了个躬，什么话都没说，跟在他主人的后面。","The officer bowed, and, without making any reply, followed in the steps of his master."
"广场上人山人海，连监狱周围都挤满了人。但是蒂莉的骑兵仍旧成功而坚决地控制着局势。","There was an immense crowd in the square and about the neighbourhood of the prison.But the dragoons of Tilly still kept it in check with the same success and with the same firmness."
"伯爵不久就听到不断逼近的人群喧闹声越来越大，人群的前几排简直像飞流直下的瀑布那样迅猛。","It was not long before the Count heard the increasing din of the approaching multitude, the first ranks of which rushed on with the rapidity of a cataract."
"同时他注意到那张纸，那张挥舞在紧握的拳头和闪闪发光的武器之上的纸。","At the same time he observed the paper, which was waving above the surface of clenched fists and glittering arms."
"“啊呀！”他说着踩着马镫站起来，用剑柄碰了碰他的中尉，“我看这群无赖真拿到命令了。”","“Halloa!” he said, rising in his stirrups, and touching his lieutenant with the knob of his sword; “I really believe those rascals have got the order.”"
"“一群卑鄙的暴徒。”中尉叫道。","“Dastardly ruffians they are,” cried the lieutenant."
"民兵护卫队正是因为拿到了命令，才在那儿胜利欢呼。拿到命令，他们即刻出发，低低地端着武器，一路狂呼地来会蒂莉的骑兵。","It was indeed the order, which the burgher guard received with a roar of triumph.They immediately sallied forth, with lowered arms and fierce shouts, to meet Count Tilly’s dragoons."
"可伯爵是不会轻易让这些人靠得太近的。","But the Count was not the man to allow them to approach within an inconvenient distance."
"“站住！”他喝道，“站住！和我的马保持距离，否则的话我就下令进攻。”","“Stop!” he cried, “stop, and keep off from my horse, or I shall give the word of command to advance.”"
"“这就是命令！”上百个声音傲慢无礼地答道。","“Here is the order!” a hundred insolent voices answered at once."
"他诧异地接过那张纸，匆匆瞥了一眼上面的内容，高声说道：","He took it in amazement, cast a rapid glance on it, and said quite aloud,—"
"“签署这命令的人就是杀害科尔内留斯·德维特的真凶。就算砍断了我双手，我也不会在这臭名昭著的命令上写一笔。”","“Those who have signed this order are the real murderers of Cornelius de Witt.I would rather have my two hands cut off than have written one single letter of this infamous order.”"
"有人想把命令从蒂莉手里拿回来，蒂莉用剑柄把他挡了回去，他补充道：","And, pushing back with the hilt of his sword the man who wanted to take it from him, he added,—"
"“等等，这样的文件很重要，可是要小心保管的。”","“Wait a minute, papers like this are of importance, and are to be kept.”"
"说着，他折起文件，小心翼翼地把它放进了上衣口袋。","Saying this, he folded up the document, and carefully put it in the pocket of his coat."
"然后转身对自己军队下达了命令：","Then, turning round towards his troop, he gave the word of command,—"
"“全体蒂莉士兵，向右转，走！”","“Tilly’s dragoons, wheel to the right!”"
"之后，他又低声说了一句，但足以让周围的人听清楚，——","After this, he added, in an undertone, yet loud enough for his words to be not altogether lost to those about him,—"
"“现在好了，你们这群刽子手，干你们的活儿去吧！”","“And now, ye butchers, do your work!”"
"监狱周围迸发出近乎疯狂的叫喊声，叫声中既有刻骨的仇恨，又有残酷的喜悦，他们就用这样的叫喊来欢送默默离去的骑兵。","A savage yell, in which all the keen hatred and ferocious triumph rife in the precincts of the prison simultaneously burst forth, and accompanied the departure of the dragoons, as they were quietly filing off."
"伯爵断后，直到最后一刻他还面对着愤怒的民众。伯爵退一步，民众就前进一步。","The Count tarried behind, facing to the last the infuriated populace, which advanced at the same rate as the Count retired."
"由此看出，约翰·德维特一点儿都没有夸大当时的危险，当时，他正扶着他哥哥起来，催哥哥赶快离开。科尔内留斯扶着前议长的胳膊，走下通往院子的楼梯。在楼梯底下，他看到浑身发抖的罗莎。","John de Witt, therefore, had by no means exaggerated the danger, when, assisting his brother in getting up, he hurried his departure.Cornelius, leaning on the arm of the Ex-Grand Pensionary, descended the stairs which led to the courtyard.At the bottom of the staircase he found little Rosa, trembling all over."
"“约翰先生，”她说，“这真是一场灾难！”","“Oh, Mynheer John,” she said, “what a misfortune!”"
"“怎么了，孩子？”德维特问。","“What is it, my child?” asked De Witt."
"“听说他们去了市政厅，说是要取让蒂莉骑兵撤退的命令。”","“They say that they are gone to the Town-hall to fetch the order for Tilly’s horse to withdraw.”"
"“这可不是说着玩儿的！”约翰说。“亲爱的孩子，要是骑兵真撤了，我们的处境确实会很艰难。”","“You do not say so!” replied John.“Indeed, my dear child, if the dragoons are off, we shall be in a very sad plight.”"
"“我有些建议。”罗莎说，她颤抖得比先前更厉害了。","“I have some advice to give you,” Rosa said, trembling even more violently than before."
"“说吧，我的孩子，就听听你的想法。上帝为什么不借你之口说点儿什么呢？”","“Well, let us hear what you have to say, my child.Why should not God speak by your mouth?”"
"“嗯，约翰先生，如果我是您，我可不会走大道。”","“Now, then, Mynheer John, if I were in your place, I should not go out through the main street.”"
"“为什么？蒂莉的骑兵不是还守在那儿吗？”","“And why so, as the dragoons of Tilly are still at their post?”"
"“没错，可是只要命令未撤回，他们就得遵命守在监狱前。”","“Yes, but their order, as long as it is not revoked, enjoins them to stop before the prison.”"
"“的确。”","“Undoubtedly.”"
"“你接到让他们护送你们出城的命令了吗？”","“Have you got an order for them to accompany you out of the town?”"
"“没有，怎么了？”","“We have not?”"
"“那样的话，你们一过骑兵的队列，就会落到民众的手里。”","“Well, then, in the very moment when you have passed the ranks of the dragoons you will fall into the hands of the people.”"
"“可是，不是还有民兵护卫队吗？”","“But the burgher guard?”"
"“哎呀！就数民兵护卫队最愤怒了。”","“Alas! the burgher guard are the most enraged of all.”"
"“那我们怎么办？”","“What are we to do, then?”"
"“约翰先生，如果我是您，”小姑娘怯怯地继续说道，“我就从后门出，那儿通向一个偏僻小巷，所有人都在大街上等着您从大门出呢。我就从那儿出去，到你们要出城的那个门。”","“If I were in your place, Mynheer John,” the young girl timidly continued, “I should leave by the postern, which leads into a deserted by-lane, whilst all the people are waiting in the High Street to see you come out by the principal entrance.From there I should try to reach the gate by which you intend to leave the town.”"
"“可我哥哥走不了路啊。”约翰说。","“But my brother is not able to walk,” said John."
"“我可以试试，”科尔内留斯说，脸上写着可敬的坚毅。","“I shall try,” Cornelius said, with an expression of most sublime fortitude."
"“可你们不是有马车吗？”姑娘问。","“But have you not got your carriage?” asked the girl."
"“马车在靠近大门的地方。”","“The carriage is down near the great entrance.”"
"“不，”她回答，“我想您的车夫一定对您忠心耿耿，我已经叫他到后门等候你们了。”","“Not so,” she replied.“I considered your coachman to be a faithful man, and I told him to wait for you at the postern.”"
"兄弟俩先是对视了片刻，然后齐刷刷地将目光投向了罗莎，充满了无限感激。","The two brothers looked first at each other, and then at Rosa, with a glance full of the most tender gratitude."
"“现在的问题是，”议长说，“不知道格里弗斯会不会为我们开这门。”","“The question is now,” said the Grand Pensionary, “whether Gryphus will open this door for us.”"
"“他是不会做这样的事的。”罗莎说。","“Indeed, he will do no such thing,” said Rosa."
"“那怎么办呢？”","“Well, and how then?”"
"“我早料到他不会答应了，就趁他隔着门房窗户和骑兵说话的时候，把那把钥匙从钥匙串儿上取了下来。”","“I have foreseen his refusal, and just now whilst he was talking from the window of the porter’s lodge with a dragoon, I took away the key from his bunch.”"
"“你拿到了钥匙了吗？”","“And you have got it?”"
"“喏，这不是，约翰先生。”","“Here it is, Mynheer John.”"
"“好孩子，”科尔内留斯说，“你为我们做了这么多，我也没啥回报你，只有那本《圣经》，你能在我房间里找到。这是一个正直人的最后礼物，我希望它能带给你好运。”","“My child,” said Cornelius, “I have nothing to give you in exchange for the service you are rendering us but the Bible which you will find in my room; it is the last gift of an honest man; I hope it will bring you good luck.”"
"“谢谢你，科尔内留斯先生，我会一直带在身上的。”罗莎回答。","“I thank you, Master Cornelius, it shall never leave me,” replied Rosa."
"接着她叹了口气，像是自言自语，“真遗憾，我不识字！”","And then, with a sigh, she said to herself, “What a pity that I do not know how to read!”"
"“叫喊声越来越大了，”约翰说，“现在一刻都不容耽误，赶快离开吧！”","“The shouts and cries are growing louder and louder,” said John; “there is not a moment to be lost.”"
"“跟我来，先生们！”姑娘说，她领着两兄弟穿过里面的大厅，来到了监狱后面。罗莎领着他们下了一段大概十几步台阶的楼梯，穿过一个环着围墙的小院子。拱形门开着，罗莎早为他们准备好了，他们来到一条偏僻的街上，在那儿他们的马车已经备好了。","“Come along, gentlemen,” said the girl, who now led the two brothers through an inner lobby to the back of the prison.Guided by her, they descended a staircase of about a dozen steps; traversed a small courtyard, which was surrounded by castellated walls; and, the arched door having been opened for them by Rosa, they emerged into a lonely street where their carriage was ready to receive them."
"“快，快，老爷！”您听见他们的叫喊了吧？”车夫叫道，看样子吓坏了。","“Quick, quick, my masters! do you hear them?” cried the coachman, in a deadly fright."
"不过，议长把科尔内留斯扶进马车，又转身对姑娘说：","Yet, after having made Cornelius get into the carriage first, the Grand Pensionary turned round towards the girl, to whom he said,—"
"“再见了，我的孩子！我没法用语言表达我们的感激。上帝会因为你救了两个人的命而眷顾你的。”","“Good-bye, my child! words could never express our gratitude.God will reward you for having saved the lives of two men.”"
"罗莎接过约翰·德维特伸给她的手，毕恭毕敬地吻了一下。","Rosa took the hand which John de Witt proffered to her, and kissed it with every show of respect."
"“走吧！看在上帝的份上，赶紧走吧！”她说，“看样子，他们要撞门了。”","“Go! for Heaven’s sake, go!” she said; “it seems they are going to force the gate.”"
"约翰·德维特迅速上车，坐在他哥哥的身边，拉上马车的布帘，对外面的车夫叫道：","John de Witt hastily got in, sat himself down by the side of his brother, and, fastening the apron of the carriage, called out to the coachman,—"
"“到托尔－赫克！”","“To the Tol-Hek!”"
"托尔－赫克是通向什文宁根海港的铁门。一艘小船在海港那里等着这两兄弟。","The Tol-Hek was the iron gate leading to the harbor of Schevening, in which a small vessel was waiting for the two brothers."
"两匹精力充沛的弗兰德马拉着这辆载着逃犯的马车全速奔跑。罗莎目送着他们，直到他们拐过了街角。她回来，关上门，把钥匙扔进一个牢房里。","The carriage drove off with the fugitives at the full speed of a pair of spirited Flemish horses.Rosa followed them with her eyes until they turned the corner of the street, upon which, closing the door after her, she went back and threw the key into a cell."
"刚刚罗莎猜测民众在撞监狱门，果不其然，刚才的声音正是暴民冲撞大门的声音。骑兵一撤出广场，他们就向大门涌过来了。","The noise which had made Rosa suppose that the people were forcing the prison door was indeed owing to the mob battering against it after the square had been left by the military."
"尽管大门很结实，尽管格里弗斯——说句公道话，他还是挺坚定勇敢的，一直拒绝开门。但显然，这扇门坚持不了多久了。监狱看守的脸变得苍白，他问自己，是自己把门打开，还是让门被撞开呢。这时候，他感到有人在轻轻地扯自己的外套。","Solid as the gate was, and although Gryphus, to do him justice, stoutly enough refused to open it, yet evidently it could not resist much longer, and the jailer, growing very pale, put to himself the question whether it would not be better to open the door than to allow it to be forced, when he felt some one gently pulling his coat."
"他扭头一看，原来是罗莎。","He turned round and saw Rosa."
"“你听到那群疯子没？”他问。","“Do you hear these madmen?” he said."
"“我听得太清楚了，爸爸，要是我是你——”","“I hear them so well, my father, that in your place—”"
"“你会开门？”","“You would open the door?”"
"“才不呢，我就让他们撞门。”","“No, I should allow it to be forced.”"
"“可是他们会杀了我的！”","“But they will kill me!”"
"“要是他们看见你，他们会的。”","“Yes, if they see you.”"
"“那我怎么才不被他们看见呢？”","“How shall they not see me?”"
"“藏起来啊。”","“Hide yourself.”"
"“藏哪儿？”","“Where?”"
"“藏秘密地牢里。”","“In the secret dungeon.”"
"“那你呢，我的孩子？”","“But you, my child?”"
"“我跟你一块儿下去。我们可以把门锁上，等他们离开监狱了，我们再出来。”","“I shall get into it with you.We shall lock the door and when they have left the prison, we shall again come forth from our hiding place.”"
"“他妈的，你说得对！”格里夫斯大声叫道，“奇怪了，你这小脑瓜里怎么啥都知道！”","“Zounds, you are right, there!” cried Gryphus; “it’s surprising how much sense there is in such a little head!”"
"于是，就在大门快要在暴徒欢欣鼓舞的叫喊声中败下阵来的时候，罗莎掀起一扇小活板说：","Then, as the gate began to give way amidst the triumphant shouts of the mob, she opened a little trap-door, and said,—"
"“来，快来啊，爸爸！”","“Come along, come along, father.”"
"“可我们的犯人怎么办？”","“But our prisoners?”"
"“上帝会看着他们的，我呢，得看着你。”","“God will watch over them, and I shall watch over you.”"
"格里弗斯跟着他女儿，关上了头顶的小活板。就在这个时候，民众撞开了大门，涌了进来。","Gryphus followed his daughter, and the trap-door closed over his head, just as the broken gate gave admittance to the populace."

"第四章 一群刽子手","Chapter 4 The Murderers"
"第五章 郁金香迷和他的邻居","Chapter 5 The Tulip-fancier and his Neighbour"
"海牙市民还在撕扯约翰和科尔内留斯的尸体，奥兰治亲王威廉在确定他的两个对手真的死了之后，在范德刚上尉的跟随下，飞驰在赶往莱顿的路上。他发现范德刚上尉心肠太软，他不能再像从前那样信任他了。此时，忠心耿耿的仆人克莱克正骑着一匹骏马沿着一条林阴大道行进，一口气奔过海牙城和周围的村庄，没想到他走后发生了怎样可怕的事情。","Whilst the burghers of the Hague were tearing in pieces the bodies of John and Cornelius de Witt, and whilst William of Orange, after having made sure that his two antagonists were really dead, was galloping over the Leyden road, followed by Captain van Deken, whom he found a little too compassionate to honour him any longer with his confidence, Craeke, the faithful servant, mounted on a good horse, and little suspecting what terrible events had taken place since his departure, proceeded along the high road lined with trees, until he was clear of the town and the neighbouring villages."
"脱险后，他就把马留在一家马房里，以免引起怀疑，不露声色地换乘运河船继续赶路。在熟悉这片水域的人的指引下，小船抄着近路继续行进，从容不迫地把他送往多特。蜿蜒的河道用它湿润的怀抱拥着众多迷人的小岛，岛边环绕着杨柳和灯心草，小岛上草木茂盛，成群的肥羊安详地吃着草，昏昏欲睡的样子。克莱克远远地就认出了多特——那座美丽的城市坐落在点缀着许多风车的小山脚下。他看见水边上有红砖白浆砌成的漂亮房子，临河的阳台装饰着绣着金花的丝绸帷幔，那可是印度和中国的上等丝织品。在这些光彩耀人的东西附近，悬着长长的钓线，用来钓贪吃的鳗鱼，每天从厨房扔到河里的垃圾把鳗鱼吸引到房子周围。","Being once safe, he left his horse at a livery stable in order not to arouse suspicion, and tranquilly continued his journey on the canal-boats, which conveyed him by easy stages to Dort, pursuing their way under skilful guidance by the shortest possible routes through the windings of the river, which held in its watery embrace so many enchanting little islands, edged with willows and rushes, and abounding in luxurious vegetation, whereon flocks of fat sheep browsed in peaceful sleepiness.Craeke from afar off recognised Dort, the smiling city, at the foot of a hill dotted with windmills.He saw the fine red brick houses, mortared in white lines, standing on the edge of the water, and their balconies, open towards the river, decked out with silk tapestry embroidered with gold flowers, the wonderful manufacture of India and China; and near these brilliant stuffs, large lines set to catch the voracious eels, which are attracted towards the houses by the garbage thrown every day from the kitchens into the river."
"克莱克站在小船的甲板上眺望，目光掠过不停转动的风车，投向山坡上那座红色和粉红相间的房子——那里就是他此行的目的地。屋顶的轮廓掩映在一片杨树的黄叶中，整座房子的周围是一片黑压压的巨大榆树林。有了这样的地势，阳光洒在房子上，就像倾泻到漏斗里。每天早晚河风吹来的、连那绿色屏障都没法阻挡的雾气，就这样被阳光蒸干、烘热，变得滋润了。","Craeke, standing on the deck of the boat, saw, across the moving sails of the windmills, on the slope of the hill, the red and pink house which was the goal of his errand.The outlines of its roof were merging in the yellow foliage of a curtain of poplar trees, the whole habitation having for background a dark grove of gigantic elms.The mansion was situated in such a way that the sun, falling on it as into a funnel, dried up, warmed, and fertilised the mist which the verdant screen could not prevent the river wind from carrying there every morning and evening."
"城市如往常一样繁忙，没有人注意到克莱克上了岸。一上岸，他就朝我们刚才描述的房子走去。这座房子白净整洁，犄角旮旯的地方比显眼的位置擦得还要干净，蜡打得还要仔细——这里住着一个真正幸福的人。","Having disembarked unobserved amid the usual bustle of the city, Craeke at once directed his steps towards the house which we have just described, and which—white, trim, and tidy, even more cleanly scoured and more carefully waxed in the hidden corners than in the places which were exposed to view—enclosed a truly happy mortal."
"这个幸福的人，稀罕人物，就是范巴尔莱博士，科尔内留斯的教子。从孩提时代起，他就一直住在这房子里，因为他的父亲和祖父就出生在这里。他们可都是高贵的多特城长期以来公认的高贵商人。","This happy mortal, rara avis, was Dr. van Baerle, the godson of Cornelius de Witt.He had inhabited the same house ever since his childhood, for it was the house in which his father and grandfather, old established princely merchants of the princely city of Dort, were born."
"老范巴尔莱先生在印度的贸易中攒下了三四十万基尔德，小范巴尔莱先生在他可敬可爱的双亲过世时，发现那些钱还是崭新的，尽管上面刻印的铸造日期一部分是一六四零年，剩下的都是一六一零年，说明有些钱是范巴尔莱的父亲的，有的是范巴尔莱的祖父留下的。但我们得赶紧告知读者，这三四十万基尔德对本故事的主人公，科尔内留斯·范巴尔莱来说仅仅是零用钱，或者说是现金，因为他在省里的地产每年都能给他带来大约一万基尔德的收入。","Mynheer van Baerle the father had amassed in the Indian trade three or four hundred thousand guilders, which Mynheer van Baerle the son, at the death of his dear and worthy parents, found still quite new, although one set of them bore the date of coinage of 1640, and the other that of 1610, a fact which proved that they were guilders of Van Baerle the father and of Van Baerle the grandfather; but we will inform the reader at once that these three or four hundred thousand guilders were only the pocket money, or sort of purse, for Cornelius van Baerle, the hero of this story, as his landed property in the province yielded him an income of about ten thousand guilders a year."
"科尔内留斯的父亲，这位值得尊敬的公民在安葬了他妻子三个月后，自己也行将就木了。他的妻子先走一步，似乎是要为他的死铺平道路，就像她生前为他铺平生活的道路一样。他最后一次抱着他儿子，对他说：","When the worthy citizen, the father of Cornelius, passed from time into eternity, three months after having buried his wife, who seemed to have departed first to smooth for him the path of death as she had smoothed for him the path of life, he said to his son, as he embraced him for the last time,—"
"“你要是想知道真正的生活，就吃吃喝喝，尽情地挥霍吧，因为从早到晚在账房的木凳或是实验室的皮椅上辛苦工作，实在是不能称为生活。你也会死的。如果你不幸，没能抱个儿子，你会让我的姓销声匿迹，而我的那些钱，就会出其不意地传给一个陌生人，而除了我父亲、我自己，还有造币人之外，没有其他人知道这些钱的具体数目。你尤其不要效仿你教父科尔内留斯·德维特，他投身于政治这一最无情无义的职业，可以断定，他将来的结局是不会好的。”","“Eat, drink, and spend your money, if you wish to know what life really is, for as to toiling from morn to evening on a wooden stool, or a leathern chair, in a counting-house or a laboratory, that certainly is not living.Your time to die will also come; and if you are not then so fortunate as to have a son, you will let my name grow extinct, and my guilders, which no one has ever fingered but my father, myself, and the coiner, will have the surprise of passing to an unknown master.And least of all, imitate the example of your godfather, Cornelius de Witt, who has plunged into politics, the most ungrateful of all careers, and who will certainly come to an untimely end.”"
"作为父亲，留下了这段临终遗言之后，可敬的老范巴尔莱先生过世了，他的儿子科尔内留斯悲痛欲绝，这孩子不爱基尔德，但却非常爱自己的父亲。","Having given utterance to this paternal advice, the worthy Mynheer van Baerle died, to the intense grief of his son Cornelius, who cared very little for the guilders, and very much for his father."
"从此以后，科尔内留斯就孤零零地住在这座大房子里。他的教父给他谋了一份公职，结果徒劳一场。教父想让他品尝荣誉的滋味，结果还是枉然－尽管科尔内留斯为了让教父高兴，真的登上了率领一百三十九艘战船的“七省联邦号”旗舰，和德留伊特尔并肩战斗。这位大名鼎鼎的海军上将带着这个船队单枪匹马地去和英法联合舰队较量。在舵手莱热尔的指导下，他曾经同“亲王号”近在咫尺，只有一个火枪射程的距离，而此时，英国国王的兄弟约克公爵在“亲王号”上。这时候，他的导师德留伊特尔发起了一场猛烈而巧妙的进攻，公爵意识到他的船将很快被击沉，只好登上“圣米歇尔号”。他看到“圣米歇尔号”被荷兰船只的舷炮打得千疮百孔，退出了战线。他还亲眼目睹了“山维克伯爵号”被击沉，四百名水手或葬身于大海，或死于炮火。他意识到所有这些毁灭性的结果——二十艘战船化为灰烬，三千人死亡，五千人受伤——没有决定任何东西，双方都宣称赢得了胜利，战争还是会一触即发，唯一决定的就是战争实录里会多一个名字——骚什乌德海湾战役。科尔内留斯估算了一下，一个喜欢沉思的人，在他的同类互相炮轰时候，光是捂眼睛、堵耳朵就得花掉多少时间。于是科尔内留斯向德留伊特尔、向“普尔唐的留亚特”和荣誉告别，他吻了议长的膝盖，对议长他怀着深深的敬意，回到了多特的家中，他还有的是自己争取来的安宁，他才二十八岁，有着强健的体魄和敏锐的洞察力，有四十多万弗罗林的资产和每年一万弗罗林的收入，他坚信，如果上天眷顾某人，为他的幸福赋予太多的东西，这些东西只会让他的生活变得悲惨。　","Cornelius then remained alone in his large house.In vain his godfather offered to him a place in the public service,—in vain did he try to give him a taste for glory,—although Cornelius, to gratify his godfather, did embark with De Ruyter upon “The Seven Provinces,” the flagship of a fleet of one hundred and thirty-nine sail, with which the famous admiral set out to contend singlehanded against the combined forces of France and England.When, guided by the pilot Leger, he had come within musket-shot of the “Prince,” with the Duke of York (the English king’s brother) aboard, upon which De Ruyter, his mentor, made so sharp and well directed an attack that the Duke, perceiving that his vessel would soon have to strike, made the best of his way aboard the “Saint Michael”; when he had seen the “Saint Michael,” riddled and shattered by the Dutch broadside, drift out of the line; when he had witnessed the sinking of the “Earl of Sandwich,” and the death by fire or drowning of four hundred sailors; when he realized that the result of all this destruction—after twenty ships had been blown to pieces, three thousand men killed and five thousand injured—was that nothing was decided, that both sides claimed the victory, that the fighting would soon begin again, and that just one more name, that of Southwold Bay, had been added to the list of battles; when he had estimated how much time is lost simply in shutting his eyes and ears by a man who likes to use his reflective powers even while his fellow creatures are cannonading one another;—Cornelius bade farewell to De Ruyter, to the Ruart de Pulten, and to glory, kissed the knees of the the Grand Pensionary, for whom he entertained the deeepest veneration, and retired to his house at Dort, rich in his well-earned repose, his twenty-eight years, an iron constitution and keen perceptions, and his capital of more than four hundred thousands of florins and income of ten thousand, convinced that a man is always endowed by Heaven with too much for his own happiness, and just enough to make him miserable."
"结果，为了满足他自己对幸福的理解，科尔内留斯开始对植物学和昆虫学感兴趣了，他采集了所有荷兰岛屿上的植物，并把它们分门别类，把全省的昆虫都制成了标本，并就此完成了一篇论文，附上他亲手画的插图。最后，当他茫然不知如何打发他的时间，尤其是他那以惊人的速度增长的财富的时候，他从他所在的那个国家、那个时代所有最风雅、最奢侈的蠢事中选择了一项——他成了一个郁金香迷。","Consequently, and to indulge his own idea of happiness, Cornelius began to be interested in the study of plants and insects, collected and classified the Flora of all the Dutch islands, arranged the whole entomology of the province, on which he wrote a treatise, with plates drawn by his own hands; and at last, being at a loss what to do with his time, and especially with his money, which went on accumulating at a most alarming rate, he took it into his head to select for himself, from all the follies of his country and of his age, one of the most elegant and expensive,—he became a tulip-fancier."
"当时，在园艺的这一领域，荷兰人和葡萄牙人正相互竞争，他们开始崇拜郁金香，并在对郁金香的狂热崇拜上大做文章，比当初自然主义者因害怕引起上帝的嫉妒竟在人类身上做文章更胜一筹。","It was the time when the Dutch and the Portuguese, rivalling each other in this branch of horticulture, had begun to worship that flower, and to make more of a cult of it than ever naturalists dared to make of the human race for fear of arousing the jealousy of God."
"不久，从多特到蒙斯，人人都开始议论范巴尔莱先生的郁金香。大家都来参观他的花圃、水洼、烘干室和收集的球茎，就像从前著名的罗马旅行家参观亚历山大的美术馆和图书馆一样。","Soon people from Dort to Mons began to talk of Mynheer van Baerle’s tulips; and his beds, pits, drying-rooms, and drawers of bulbs were visited, as the galleries and libraries of Alexandria were by illustrious Roman travellers."
"刚开始，范巴尔莱把他每年的收入用在采集的准备工作上，后来就动用了他那崭新的基尔德使采集工作日臻完美。　他的努力也确实取得了丰硕的成果：他培育出五个郁金香的新品种，一种用他母亲的名字“雅内”命名；一种取了他父亲的名字，叫“范巴尔莱”；还有一种叫“科尔内留斯”，是他教父的名字，剩下的叫什么我们就不记得了，不过郁金香的爱好者一定能在当时的品种目录中找到。","Van Baerle began by expending his yearly revenue in laying the groundwork of his collection, after which he broke in upon his new guilders to bring it to perfection.His exertions, indeed, were crowned with a most magnificent result: he produced five new tulips, which he called the “Jane,” after his mother; the “Van Baerle,” after his father; and the “Cornelius,” after his godfather; the other names have escaped us, but the fanciers will be sure to find them in the catalogues of the times."
"一六七二年年初，科尔内留斯·德维特来到多特，他要在他家族留下的老房子里住上三个月，因为，多特不仅是科尔内留斯一个人的出生地，几个世纪以来，他的家族一直住在那里。","In the beginning of the year 1672, Cornelius de Witt came to Dort for three months, to live at his old family mansion; for not only was he born in that city, but his family had been resident there for centuries."
"那时候，正如奥兰治亲王威廉所说，科尔内留斯已经完全不得人心了。然而，在他的同乡——善良的多特居民眼里，他并不是一个罪该万死的犯人。人们是不太喜欢他那稍显刻板的共和主义，但他们欣赏他的勇猛。当他进城的时候，人们还是愿意以城市的名义向他举杯庆贺。","Cornelius, at that period, as William of Orange said, began to enjoy the most perfect unpopularity.To his fellow citizens, the good burghers of Dort, however, he did not appear in the light of a criminal who deserved to be hung.It is true, they did not particularly like his somewhat austere republicanism, but they were proud of his valour; and when he made his entrance into their town, the cup of honour was offered to him, readily enough, in the name of the city."
"科尔内留斯向他的同乡道完谢后，来到他父辈留下的老宅子，吩咐手下修补一番，希望能赶在他妻子和孩子来之前把房子修好。之后，他来到他教子的家，恐怕他的教子是多特城里唯一一个不知道他还乡的人。","After having thanked his fellow citizens, Cornelius proceeded to his old paternal house, and gave directions for some repairs, which he wished to have executed before the arrival of his wife and children; and thence he wended his way to the house of his godson, who perhaps was the only person in Dort as yet unacquainted with the presence of Cornelius in the town."
"科尔内留斯·德维特播撒下了被称为政治热情的恶种，因此激起了人们的仇恨，这仇恨有多深，范巴尔莱赢得他同乡对他的喜爱就有多深，人们欣赏他对政治不闻不问，潜心培育郁金香的那股子钻劲儿。","In the same degree as Cornelius de Witt had excited the hatred of the people by sowing those evil seeds which are called political passions, Van Baerle had gained the affections of his fellow citizens by completely shunning the pursuit of politics, absorbed as he was in the peaceful pursuit of cultivating tulips."
"范巴尔莱为他的仆人和工人所喜爱，他压根没想到这世界上还有人会对别人怀有恶意。","Van Baerle was truly beloved by his servants and labourers; nor had he any conception that there was in this world a man who wished ill to another."
"尽管令人类蒙羞，但我们必须得说，科尔内留斯·范巴尔莱有一个仇人，虽然他自己不知道。议长和他哥哥即使在对他们恨之入骨的奥兰治派中间，也没有那样一个针锋相对、不共戴天的仇人。这对为国家和人民尽心尽力的兄弟，生前没有因为半点儿误会而产生隔阂，面对死亡他们相互忠诚，他们的兄弟情谊死后定会流芳百世。","And yet it must be said, to the disgrace of mankind, that Cornelius van Baerle, without being aware of the fact, had a much more ferocious, fierce, and implacable enemy than the Grand Pensionary and his brother had among the Orange party, who were most hostile to the devoted brothers, who had never been sundered by the least misunderstanding during their lives, and by their mutual devotion in the face of death made sure the existence of their brotherly affection beyond the grave."
"就在科尔内留斯·范巴尔莱开始潜心种植郁金香，把他每年的收入和他父亲留下的钱都花在这个爱好上的时候，在多德雷赫克有一个叫伊萨克·博克斯戴尔的公民，就住在他隔壁。此人从懂事之起就和他有相同的爱好，只要一提到“tulban”这个字眼就会欣喜若狂。“tulban”是锡兰语中曾用来指园艺杰作的第一个单词，之后称为郁金香。这一点可是得到《法国植物学家》在此花研究领域里最高权威的确认。","At the time when Cornelius van Baerle began to devote himself to tulip-growing, expending on this hobby his yearly revenue and the guilders of his father, there was at Dort, living next door to him, a citizen of the name of Isaac Boxtel who from the age when he was able to think for himself had indulged the same fancy, and who was in ecstasies at the mere mention of the word “tulban,” which (as we are assured by the “Floriste Francaise,” the most highly considered authority in matters relating to this flower) is the first word in the Cingalese tongue which was ever used to designate that masterpiece of floriculture which is now called the tulip."
"博克斯戴尔不如范巴尔莱运气好，没那么有钱。因此，他只有靠耐心和小心呵护，靠勤扒苦干，在多特家附近开辟出一个适合培育他娇贵花儿的园地。他按照最行之有效的配方混合土壤，按照园艺手册中最严谨的要求给温床提供适量的温度和新鲜空气。","Boxtel had not the good fortune of being rich, like Van Baerle.He had therefore, with great care and patience, and by dint of strenuous exertions, laid out near his house at Dort a garden fit for the culture of his cherished flower; he had mixed the soil according to the most approved prescriptions, and given to his hotbeds just as much heat and fresh air as the strictest rules of horticulture exact."
"伊萨克了解他温室的温度，哪怕是二十分之一度的温差他都察觉得出来。他清楚气流的强度，会调节气流使之适应花茎的弯曲度。他的产品也开始得到大众的喜爱。花儿不但美丽娇艳，而且卓尔不群。不少爱好者来参观博克斯戴尔的郁金香。后来，他居然在林奈和都纳福的世界里创造出一种以他名字命名的郁金香，这种郁金香很快就蜚声国外了，传遍法国后，进军西班牙，后来竟一路传到了葡萄牙；葡萄牙国王唐阿尔丰沙六世被赶出里斯本后，隐居在特尔塞拉岛上，他没有像伟大的孔戴那样把浇康乃馨作为消遣，而是种植郁金香自娱自乐，当他看到“博克斯戴尔”时都惊呼：“无论如何，真不错！”","Isaac knew the temperature of his frames to the twentieth part of a degree.He knew the strength of the current of air, and tempered it so as to adapt it to the wave of the stems of his flowers.His productions also began to meet with the favour of the public.They were beautiful, nay, distinguished.Several fanciers had come to see Boxtel’s tulips.At last he had even started amongst all the Linnaeuses and Tourneforts a tulip which bore his name, and which, after having travelled all through France, had found its way into Spain, and penetrated as far as Portugal; and the King, Don Alfonso VI.—who, being expelled from Lisbon, had retired to the island of Terceira, where he amused himself, not, like the great Conde, with watering his carnations, but with growing tulips—had, on seeing the Boxtel tulip, exclaimed, “Not so bad, by any means!”"
"科尔内留斯·范巴尔莱在做了各种学术研究后，忽然狂热地迷上了郁金香，他改造了他在多特的房子，我们之前已经说过，他的房子就在博克斯戴尔房子的隔壁。他把他庭院里的一个建筑加高了一层，挡住了阳光，这样一来就从博克斯戴尔的花园里抢走了半度的温暖，而且另一方面，冬天时又增加了半度的严寒，更别说它还挡住了风，把他邻居的园艺计划和安排全给打乱了。","All at once, Cornelius van Baerle, who, after all his learned pursuits, had been seized with the tulipomania, made some changes in his house at Dort, which, as we have stated, was next door to that of Boxtel.He raised a certain building in his court-yard by a story, which shutting out the sun, took half a degree of warmth from Boxtel’s garden, and, on the other hand, added half a degree of cold in winter; not to mention that it cut the wind, and disturbed all the horticultural calculations and arrangements of his neighbour."
"不管怎样，这些小意外在博克斯戴尔看来也没什么大不了。范巴尔莱不过是一个画家，一个想在帆布上重现和丑化自然界奇迹的傻瓜。他想，画家为了获得更多的阳光，把自己的画室加高一层，就此说来，人家也没做错什么。范巴尔莱先生是个画家，就跟博克斯戴尔先生是位郁金香培育者一样；他为了他的画需要更多一点的阳光，所以就夺走了邻居郁金香的半度温暖。","After all, this mishap appeared to Boxtel of no great consequence.Van Baerle was but a painter, a sort of fool who tried to reproduce and disfigure on canvas the wonders of nature.The painter, he thought, had raised his studio by a story to get better light, and thus far he had only been in the right.Mynheer van Baerle was a painter, as Mynheer Boxtel was a tulip-grower; he wanted somewhat more sun for his paintings, and he took half a degree from his neighbour’s tulips."
"范巴尔莱的行为是合法的，博克斯戴尔只能接受。","The law was for Van Baerle, and Boxtel had to abide by it."
"何况，伊萨克发现过多的阳光对郁金香是有害的，这花儿在早上和煦的阳光下，比在中午烈日的高温下，长的更快，色泽也更鲜艳。因此，他甚至有些感激科尔内留斯·范巴尔莱免费为他提供了一个屏障。","Besides, Isaac had made the discovery that too much sun was injurious to tulips, and that this flower grew quicker, and had a better colouring, with the temperate warmth of morning, than with the powerful heat of the midday sun.He therefore felt almost grateful to Cornelius van Baerle for having given him a screen gratis."
"可能这与总体事实不太吻合，尤其是与伊萨克·博克斯戴尔的情绪不吻合。伟人在重大灾难面前，总能从哲学的慰藉中得到巨大的帮助，这真是一件让人吃惊的事！","Maybe this was not quite in accordance with the true state of things in general, and of Isaac Boxtel’s feelings in particular.It is certainly astonishing what rich comfort great minds, in the midst of momentous catastrophes, will derive from the consolations of philosophy."
"可是，哎呀！这个时运不佳的博克斯戴尔看到新加楼层的窗台边搁置着郁金香球茎、幼苗还有盆栽，总之，那里有一切与郁金香迷的工作相关的东西，这时候的他该多么痛苦啊！","But alas!What was the agony of the unfortunate Boxtel on seeing the windows of the new story set out with bulbs and seedlings of tulips for the border, and tulips in pots; in short, with everything pertaining to the pursuits of a tulip-monomaniac!"
"那有成捆的标签、架子、分成小格的抽屉，架子上还加了铁丝护栏，既可以让空气流通，又可以挡住蛞蝓、家鼠、睡鼠和田鼠，这些家伙对两千法郎一株的郁金香垂涎三尺，都可算得上好奇的郁金香迷。","There were bundles of labels, cupboards, and drawers with compartments, and wire guards for the cupboards, to allow free access to the air whilst keeping out slugs, mice, dormice, and rats, all of them very curious fanciers of tulips at two thousand francs a bulb."
"博克斯戴尔看到所有的这些器具时，大吃一惊，不过他尚未完全意识到自己不幸到什么程度。人人都知道范巴尔莱喜欢一切好看的东西。为了画画，他深入全面地研究自然。他的画完成得就如他的老师热拉尔·道和他的朋友米埃利斯的作品一样细腻。他为了画郁金香种植者工作室的内景，把所有的装饰配件摆在他的新画室里，难道没有这种可能性吗？","Boxtel was quite amazed when he saw all this apparatus, but he was not as yet aware of the full extent of his misfortune.Van Baerle was known to be fond of everything that pleases the eye.He studied Nature in all her aspects for the benefit of his paintings, which were as minutely finished as those of Gerard Dow, his master, and of Mieris, his friend.Was it not possible, that, having to paint the interior of a tulip-grower’s, he had collected in his new studio all the accessories of decoration?"
"尽管博克斯戴尔用那些虚幻的假设宽慰着自己，但他还是没法抵御那不断吞噬他的强烈好奇心。因此，他晚上搬了把梯子，立在他们两家花园的隔墙上，窥探着他的邻居范巴尔莱的花园，他这才弄明白了，原来那块种满各种花草的大大的方形花圃的土壤已经被翻过了，泥土是肥土和河泥混合而成的，这种混合土对郁金香特别适宜，花畦周围还环了一圈草皮，以防土壤流失。此外，充足的树阴可以调节中午的高温，朝向西南偏南的方向，丰富的水源供应，而且就在手边。总而言之，不但具备了保证成功培植的条件，连保证发展的条件都一应俱全。毫无疑问，范巴尔莱已经成为一名郁金香培育者了。","Yet, although thus consoling himself with illusory suppositions, Boxtel was not able to resist the burning curiosity which was devouring him.In the evening, therefore, he placed a ladder against the partition wall between their gardens, and, looking into that of his neighbour Van Baerle, he convinced himself that the soil of a large square bed, which had formerly been occupied by different plants, was removed, and the ground disposed in beds of loam mixed with river mud (a combination which is particularly favourable to the tulip), and the whole surrounded by a border of turf to keep the soil in its place.Besides this, sufficient shade to temper the noonday heat; aspect south-southwest; water in abundant supply, and at hand; in short, every requirement to insure not only success but also progress.There could not be a doubt that Van Baerle had become a tulip-grower."
"博克斯戴尔立马就想象出，这个博学多识的人，拥有四十万基尔德的资产和一万基尔德的年收入，把他所有的聪明才智和财力都投到培育郁金香上。他预见到他邻居的成功，这个念头一闪过，他就感到一阵剧痛，痛得双手无力，两膝发软，绝望地从梯子上摔了下来。","Boxtel at once pictured to himself this learned man, with a capital of four hundred thousand and a yearly income of ten thousand guilders, devoting all his intellectual and financial resources to the cultivation of the tulip.He foresaw his neighbour’s success, and he felt such a pang at the mere idea of this success that his hands dropped powerless, his knees trembled, and he fell in despair from the ladder."
"看来，范巴尔莱从他那里夺走半度温度，不是为了画郁金香，而是为了培育真正的郁金香。这么看来，范巴尔莱除了拥有得天独厚的朝向外，还有一间通风的保存球茎和幼苗的大屋子；而他，博克斯戴尔，要达到这一目的，只有腾出自己的卧房，唯恐与球茎和幼苗睡在同一个屋里会对它们不利，他只有睡到条件恶劣的阁楼里去。","And thus it was not for the sake of painted tulips, but for real ones, that Van Baerle took from him half a degree of warmth.And thus Van Baerle was to have the most admirably fitted aspect, and, besides, a large, airy, and well ventilated chamber where to preserve his bulbs and seedlings; while he, Boxtel, had been obliged to give up for this purpose his bedroom, and, lest his sleeping in the same apartment might injure his bulbs and seedlings, had taken up his abode in a miserable garret."
"博克斯戴尔就这样在隔壁有了一个对手，一个受欢迎的竞争对手，而且这个对手不是个名不见经传的园艺爱好者，而是科尔内留斯·德维特的教子，也就是说，是个名人。","Boxtel, then, was to have next door to him a rival and successful competitor; and his rival, instead of being some unknown, obscure gardener, was the godson of Mynheer Cornelius de Witt, that is to say, a celebrity."
"读者可以看出，博克斯戴尔不具有保罗斯的精神，保罗斯被亚历山大挫败后，因征服自己的人是个名人而感到宽慰。","Boxtel, as the reader may see, was not possessed of the spirit of Porus, who, on being conquered by Alexander, consoled himself with the celebrity of his conqueror."
"如果范巴尔莱给郁金香取名叫“科尔内留斯”后，现在又培育出新品种，并叫它“约翰·德维特”，那可怎么办？这简直会让人气不打一处来。","And now if Van Baerle produced a new tulip, and named it the John de Witt, after having named one the Cornelius?It was indeed enough to choke one with rage."
"博克斯戴尔出于嫉妒预见了将来，却成为自己厄运的预言家。在此令人沮丧的发现后，可以想象得到，他度过了最难熬的一夜。","Thus Boxtel, with jealous foreboding, became the prophet of his own misfortune.And, after having made this melancholy discovery, he passed the most wretched night imaginable."

"从那一刻起，博克斯戴尔对郁金香的兴趣不再是他努力的动力，而成为一种逐渐麻木的焦虑。从此，他每天翻来覆去想着他的邻居会给他带来的伤害，结果他最喜爱的职业成了他持续不断的痛苦之源。","From that moment Boxtel’s interest in tulips was no longer a stimulus to his exertions, but a deadening anxiety.Henceforth all his thoughts ran only upon the injury which his neighbour would cause him, and thus his favourite occupation was changed into a constant source of misery to him."
"不难想象，范巴尔莱一旦在他的新爱好上施展一下他与生俱来的聪明才智，就成功地培育出最美的郁金香。的确，他甚至了解如何变化颜色、改变外形以培育出新品种。在这点上，连哈勒姆和莱顿这两个土地最肥沃，气候最适宜的城市里，都没人能比得上他。","Van Baerle, as may easily be imagined, had no sooner begun to apply his natural ingenuity to his new fancy, than he succeeded in growing the finest tulips.Indeed; he knew better than any one else at Haarlem or Leyden—the two towns which boast the best soil and the most congenial climate—how to vary the colours, to modify the shape, and to produce new species."
"他属于自然诙谐的那一流派。这个流派十七世纪时把其中一个成员一六五三年说的一句格言当作他们的座右铭：“鄙视鲜花就是触犯上帝。”","He belonged to that natural, humorous school who took for their motto in the seventeenth century the aphorism uttered by one of their number in 1653,—“To despise flowers is to offend God.”"
"基于上述前提，该郁金香迷流派——所有流派中最排外的一个，于同年得出以下三段论：","From that premise the school of tulip-fanciers, the most exclusive of all schools, worked out the following syllogism in the same year:—"
"“鄙视鲜花就是触犯上帝。","“To despise flowers is to offend God."
"“花儿越美，谁鄙视它，谁就越触犯上帝。","“The more beautiful the flower is, the more does one offend God in despising it."
"“郁金香是所有花儿中最美的。","“The tulip is the most beautiful of all flowers."
"“因此，谁鄙视郁金香，谁就极大地触犯了上帝，罪不可赦。”","“Therefore, he who despises the tulip offends God beyond measure.”"
"照如此推断，荷兰、法国和葡萄牙的四五千郁金香种植者（我们暂且忽略锡兰、中国和印度的种植者），如果真这样做的话，全世界的人都被剥夺了教权，那几亿不把拯救的希望系于郁金香的人都被打成了宗教分裂者和异教徒，罪该万死。","By reasoning of this kind, it can be seen that the four or five thousand tulip-growers of Holland, France, and Portugal, leaving out those of Ceylon and China and the Indies, might, if so disposed, put the whole world under the ban, and condemn as schismatics and heretics and deserving of death the several hundred millions of mankind whose hopes of salvation were not centred upon the tulip."
"我们丝毫不怀疑，在这样的事业中，博克斯戴尔尽管是范巴尔莱的死敌，他仍会和范巴尔莱在同一旗帜下前进。","We cannot doubt that in such a cause Boxtel, though he was Van Baerle’s deadly foe, would have marched under the same banner with him."
"因此，人人都在谈论范巴尔莱先生和他的郁金香。谈得多了，博克斯戴尔的名字就永远从荷兰著名郁金香种植者的名单上消失了，多特的郁金香种植界也是由科尔内留斯·范巴尔莱这位谦恭温和的学者作代表。","Mynheer van Baerle and his tulips, therefore, were in the mouth of everybody; so much so, that Boxtel’s name disappeared for ever from the list of the notable tulip-growers in Holland, and those of Dort were now represented by Cornelius van Baerle, the modest and inoffensive savant."
"全情投入播种、栽培和采集工作的范巴尔莱得到了整个欧洲郁金香培植界同行的青睐和赞扬，他压根就没想到一个被他篡夺了宝座的觊觎者就住在他隔壁。","Engaging, heart and soul, in his pursuits of sowing, planting, and gathering, Van Baerle, caressed by the whole fraternity of tulip-growers in Europe, entertained nor the least suspicion that there was at his very door a pretender whose throne he had usurped."
"他在他的事业上不懈地努力，最终获得一次又一次的成功；两年中，他在他的花圃里培育出那么多奇特的品种，继上帝之后，或许除莎士比亚和鲁本斯外，还没有哪个人能在数量上与他匹敌。","He went on in his career, and consequently in his triumphs; and in the course of two years he covered his borders with such marvellous productions as no mortal man, following in the tracks of the Creator, except perhaps Shakespeare and Rubens, have equalled in point of numbers."
"而且，如果但丁想要给他《神曲》的《地狱篇》中的人物增添一个新类型的话，他可以选择范巴尔莱成功时期的博克斯戴尔。当科尔内留斯给他的花圃除草、施肥和浇水时，当他跪在花坛边，研究盛开的郁金香的每一根脉络，思忖着如何混合颜色或不混色才能有效地改良时，博克斯戴尔躲在一棵西克莫无花果树后窥视，他让那树呈扇形，长到了隔墙顶上。他窥视他邻居一举一动的时候，眼珠子都快蹦出来了，嘴巴泛着唾沫。只要他认为他瞅见对方挺开心，或者从对方的唇角辨出了笑意，抑或是对方眼里闪过满足感，他就开始朝邻居宣泄，一股脑的诅咒，满腔怒火的威胁，让人觉得奇怪的是，如此恶毒的、充满忌妒和仇恨的气息丝毫没有伤害到无辜的花儿，要知道，这些愤怒、仇恨可都是由这些花儿激起的。","And also, if Dante had wished for a new type to be added to his characters of the Inferno, he might have chosen Boxtel during the period of Van Baerle’s successes.Whilst Cornelius was weeding, manuring, watering his beds, whilst, kneeling on the turf border, he analysed every vein of the flowering tulips, and meditated on the modifications which might be effected by crosses of colour or otherwise, Boxtel, concealed behind a small sycamore which he had trained at the top of the partition wall in the shape of a fan, watched, with his eyes starting from their sockets and with foaming mouth, every step and every gesture of his neighbour; and whenever he thought he saw him look happy, or descried a smile on his lips, or a flash of contentment glistening in his eyes, he poured out towards him such a volley of maledictions and furious threats as to make it indeed a matter of wonder that this venomous breath of envy and hatred did not carry a blight on the innocent flowers which had excited it."
"邪恶的念头一旦支配了人心，会不断驱使着他，不会让他停下。博克斯戴尔很快就不满足于仅仅观察范巴尔莱了。他还想看邻居的花儿。他感觉自己像个艺术家，对手的杰作深深地吸引着他。","When the evil spirit has once taken hold of the heart of man, it urges him on, without letting him stop.Thus Boxtel soon was no longer content with seeing Van Baerle.He wanted to see his flowers, too; he had the feelings of an artist, the master-piece of a rival engrossed his interest."
"因此，他买了架望远镜，有了望远镜，他就可以观察得跟花主人本人一样细微了，花儿每一个变化——从第一年灰白的子叶破土而出，到五年后，含苞怒放，花瓣最终展示出花苞里蕴藏的宝藏——他都能看得清清楚楚。有多少次，这个心怀妒嫉的可怜人不得不观看着范巴尔莱花圃里的郁金香，那些花儿美得让他眩晕，而且完美得差点让他窒息。","He therefore bought a telescope, which enabled him to watch as accurately as did the owner himself every progressive development of the flower, from the moment when, in the first year, its pale seed-leaf begins to peep from the ground, to that glorious one, when, after five years, its petals at last reveal the hidden treasures of its chalice.How often had the miserable, jealous man to observe in Van Baerle’s beds tulips which dazzled him by their beauty, and almost choked him by their perfection!"
"于是，他一开始还情不自禁地赞赏一番，后来就开始饱受嫉妒的煎熬，这种焦躁慢慢爬上他的心头，把他的心变成一窝毒蛇，他们相互吞噬，又不断重生。有多少次，博克斯戴尔在那些笔墨难以形容的折磨之下，有在夜里跳进邻居花园的冲动，他要毁了那些植物，他要咬坏那些球茎，如果主人敢出来捍卫自己的郁金香话，他就拿主人的生命祭奠自己的愤怒！","And then, after the first blush of the admiration which he could not help feeling, he began to be tortured by the pangs of envy, by that slow fever which creeps over the heart and changes it into a nest of vipers, each devouring the other and ever born anew.How often did Boxtel, in the midst of tortures which no pen is able fully to describe,—how often did he feel an inclination to jump down into the garden during the night, to destroy the plants, to tear the bulbs with his teeth, and to sacrifice to his wrath the owner himself, if he should venture to stand up for the defence of his tulips!"
"可是在一个真正的郁金香爱好者看来，毁掉一株郁金香是件可怕的罪行，比杀个人都可怕。","But to kill a tulip was a horrible crime in the eyes of a genuine tulip-fancier; as to killing a man, it would not have mattered so very much."
"然而，范巴尔莱在郁金香培植上取得了巨大的进步，他好像是凭着他的天禀掌握这门高贵的学科，这最终让博克斯戴尔愤怒到恨不能朝他邻居的花架里扔石头和棍子。但是一想到自己一定会被人发现，他不仅会受法律制裁，还从此在欧洲郁金香培植界里颜面尽失，他就转而想使些伎俩以泄恨。他想设计一个计划，既能达到他的目的，又不用把自己搭进去。","Yet Van Baerle made such progress in the noble science of growing tulips, which he seemed to master with the true instinct of genius, that Boxtel at last was maddened to such a degree as to think of throwing stones and sticks into the flower-stands of his neighbour.But, remembering that he would be sure to be found out, and that he would not only be punished by law, but also dishonoured for ever in the face of all the tulip-growers of Europe, he had recourse to stratagem, and, to gratify his hatred, tried to devise a plan by means of which he might gain his ends without being compromised himself."
"他考虑了很长时间，终于有了一个好点子。","He considered a long time, and at last his meditations were crowned with success."
"一天晚上，他把两只猫的后腿用一根六英尺长的绳子捆在一起，然后把它们从墙扔到贵族的花圃，王侯的花圃，帝王的花圃中间，那里不仅有“科尔内留斯·德维特”，还有奶白色的、镶着紫色和粉红色边儿的“不拉本美人”，亚麻色的、还调抹着红色和肉色的“鹿特丹大理石”，“哈勒姆奇迹”，“浅哥隆班”和“深哥隆班”。","One evening he tied two cats together by their hind legs with a string about six feet in length, and threw them from the wall into the midst of that noble, that princely, that royal bed, which contained not only the “Cornelius de Witt,” but also the “Beauty of Brabant,” milk-white, edged with purple and pink, the “Marble of Rotterdam,” colour of flax, blossoms feathered red and flesh colour, the “Wonder of Haarlem,” the “Colombin obscur,” and the “Columbin clair terni.”"
"受到惊吓的两只猫一落到地上，就在花圃上朝着不同的方向飞奔，直到捆着它们的绳子绷得紧紧的；随后，它们感到逃脱是没可能了，就开始在花丛中挣扎，一边来回拉扯、上蹿下跳，一边拼命的叫，结果绳子勒断了好些花儿。就这样折腾了一刻钟，它们终于把拴住它们的绳子挣断了，跑得无影无踪。","The frightened cats, having alighted on the ground, first tried to fly each in a different direction, until the string by which they were tied together was tightly stretched across the bed; then, however, feeling that they were not able to get off, they began to pull to and fro, and to wheel about with hideous caterwaulings, mowing down with their string the flowers among which they were struggling, until, after a furious strife of about a quarter of an hour, the string broke and the combatants vanished."
"躲在西克莫无花果树后的博克斯戴尔，尽管眼前一片漆黑，什么都瞧不见，可是猫的凄厉叫声告诉了他一切，他那颗愤恨不平的心怦怦地跳着，充满了胜利的喜悦。","Boxtel, hidden behind his sycamore, could not see anything, as it was pitch-dark; but the piercing cries of the cats told the whole tale, and his heart overflowing with gall now throbbed with triumphant joy."
"博克斯戴尔急于想了解这次破坏的程度，为了尽情欣赏那两只猫在他邻居的花圃里挣扎折腾后留下的一片狼藉，他愣是在那里守到了天亮。晨雾冻得他瑟瑟发抖，可他没觉得冷，复仇的希望让他热血沸腾。他仇人的懊恼将会是他本人吃过的所有苦头的补偿。","Boxtel was so eager to ascertain the extent of the injury, that he remained at his post until morning to feast his eyes on the sad state in which the two cats had left the flower-beds of his neighbour.The mists of the morning chilled his frame, but he did not feel the cold, the hope of revenge keeping his blood at fever heat.The chagrin of his rival was to pay for all the inconvenience which he incurred himself."
"天刚擦亮，那幢白房子的门开了，范巴尔莱走出来，脸上挂着微笑，看样子他昨晚睡了个好觉，还做了个美梦，他径直朝他的花坛走去。","At the earliest dawn the door of the white house opened, and Van Baerle made his appearance, approaching the flower-beds with the smile of a man who has passed the night comfortably in his bed, and has had happy dreams."
"他突然注意到花圃里有一条条的沟痕和一个个小土堆，可是昨晚这片地还平坦得跟镜子一样。他马上又发现还有一排排整齐的郁金香七倒八歪的，就像炮弹投进了军队，乱作一团的士兵举着的长矛一样。","All at once he perceived furrows and little mounds of earth on the beds which only the evening before had been as smooth as a mirror, all at once he perceived the symmetrical rows of his tulips to be completely disordered, like the pikes of a battalion in the midst of which a shell has fallen."
"他脸色煞白地奔过去。","He ran up to them with blanched cheek."
"博克斯戴尔乐坏了。十五到二十株被摧残的郁金香倒在地上，有的弯了腰，有的则完全被折断，凋零了，受伤的球茎渗出了汁液，范巴尔莱多想用自己的鲜血换回这宝贵的汁液啊！","Boxtel trembled with joy.Fifteen or twenty tulips, torn and crushed, were lying about, some of them bent, others completely broken and already withering, the sap oozing from their bleeding bulbs: how gladly would Van Baerle have redeemed that precious sap with his own blood!"
"可令人吃惊的是，还有让他庆幸的事！这让他的仇人博克斯戴尔失望之极！博克斯戴尔打算加害的四株郁金香丝毫未受损。它们骄傲地抬着它们高贵的头，挺立于被谋害的同伴的尸体之上。这足以宽慰范巴尔莱了，也足以激起园艺凶手的怒火。他看到自己一手策划的罪行是徒劳一场，气得直扯自己的头发。","But what were his surprise and his delight! what was the disappointment of his rival!Not one of the four tulips which the latter had meant to destroy was injured at all.They raised proudly their noble heads above the corpses of their slain companions.This was enough to console Van Baerle, and enough to fan the rage of the horticultural murderer, who tore his hair at the sight of the effects of the crime which he had committed in vain."
"范巴尔莱猜不出这起意外的起因，庆幸的是，事情远没有它可能造成的损失严重。一番调查后，他方知昨晚一整夜猫叫得特别厉害。此外，他还发现一些猫的痕迹——它们的爪印、掉在撕扯战场上的毛。因此，为了防止今后发生类似的事情，他命令从今往后都要有一个花匠睡在靠近花坛的岗亭里。","Van Baerle could not imagine the cause of the mishap, which, fortunately, was of far less consequence than it might have been.On making inquiries, he learned that the whole night had been disturbed by terrible caterwaulings.He besides found traces of the cats, their footmarks and hairs left behind on the battle-field; to guard, therefore, in future against a similar outrage, he gave orders that henceforth one of the under gardeners should sleep in the garden in a sentry-box near the flower-beds."
"博克斯戴尔看着他下的命令，也看着岗亭在当天就建起来了。但他觉得自己运气好，没有被怀疑，他对那位成功园艺家的愤怒又多了几分，他决心等待时机。","Boxtel heard him give the order, and saw the sentry-box put up that very day; but he deemed himself lucky in not having been suspected, and, being more than ever incensed against the successful horticulturist, he resolved to bide his time."
"就在那时候，哈勒姆郁金香协会设置了一个奖项，奖励发现没有一点杂色的大黑郁金香的人——注意我们没敢用“培育”一词，还没人能培育出黑郁金香，那被看作是一项不可能完成的任务，因为当时连接近深棕色的品种都没有。因此，人们都说该奖项的设置者不妨把十万盾基尔德的奖金提高到两百万，反正没人能拿到。","Just then the Tulip Society of Haarlem offered a prize for the discovery (we dare not say the manufacture) of a large black tulip without a spot of colour, a thing which had not yet been accomplished, and was considered impossible, as at that time there did not exist a flower of that species approaching even to a dark nut brown.It was, therefore, generally said that the founders of the prize might just as well have offered two millions as a hundred thousand guilders, since no one would be able to gain it."
"尽管如此，这则消息还是在郁金香培植界掀起了不小的轰动。一些爱好者打定主意干一场，但不抱成功的希望。可是花卉研究者的想象力就是如此，虽然认定这次努力会失败，但他们所有的心思都花在大黑郁金香上了。就如同贺拉斯诗中的黑天鹅，抑或是法国民俗中的白渡鸦一样，人们认为黑郁金香不过是种幻想。","The tulip-growing world, however, was thrown by it into a state of most active commotion.Some fanciers caught at the idea without believing it practicable, but such is the power of imagination among florists, that although considering the undertaking as certain to fail, all their thoughts were engrossed by that great black tulip, which was looked upon to be as chimerical as the black swan of Horace or the white raven of French tradition."
"范巴尔莱就是那些打定主意培植黑郁金香的人当中的一个，而博克斯戴尔则想着如何投机取巧。培植黑郁金香的想法刚在范巴尔莱那颗清晰灵活的头脑里扎下根儿，他就慢慢开始了必要的种植和杂交工作，他要把已经由红色变为褐色的郁金香再变成深褐色。","Van Baerle was one of the tulip-growers who were struck with the idea; Boxtel thought of it in the light of a speculation.Van Baerle, as soon as the idea had once taken root in his clear and ingenious mind, began slowly the necessary planting and cross-breeding to reduce the tulips which he had grown already from red to brown, and from brown to dark brown."
"第二年，他已经成功地培育出纯深褐色的郁金香，博克斯戴尔也在他邻居的花圃里看到了那些花儿，而他自己还只种出了浅褐色的。","By the next year he had obtained flowers of a perfect nut-brown, and Boxtel espied them in the border, whereas he had himself as yet only succeeded in producing the light brown."
"也许，给读者解释一系列郁金香从不同的元素中吸取颜色的奇妙理论是件有趣的事。如果我们断言并证实对一个花卉研究者来说，没有什么事情是不可能的，只要他能理智、谨慎并且耐心地利用太阳之热量、水之清澈、大地之甘饴和微风之凉爽，这或许会使读者感到愉悦。但这可不是一般意义上的郁金香论文，我们着手写的可是一朵特殊郁金香的故事，因此尽管这门学科和咱们的故事主题相近，但我们还是不信马由缰了。","It might perhaps be interesting to explain to the gentle reader the beautiful chain of theories which go to prove that the tulip borrows its colors from the elements; perhaps we should give him pleasure if we were to maintain and establish that nothing is impossible for a florist who avails himself with judgment and discretion and patience of the sun’s heat; the clear water, the juices of the earth, and the cool breezes.But this is not a treatise upon tulips in general; it is the story of one particular tulip which we have undertaken to write, and to that we limit ourselves, however alluring the subject which is so closely allied to ours."
"博克斯戴尔又一次被他痛恨的对手的优越感打败了，现在他完全对郁金香培植厌倦了，人也像疯了似的，将全部精力都投入到偷窥上。","Boxtel, once more worsted by the superiority of his hated rival, was now completely disgusted with tulip-growing, and, being driven half mad, devoted himself entirely to observation."
"他偷窥他对手的家，视野还是很开阔的。烈日下的花园、玻璃墙房间、室内的陈设——架子、橱柜、盒子，还有贴着标签的分类架——用望远镜观察可是一览无遗。博克斯戴尔就让他的球茎腐烂在坑里，幼苗干死在盒子里，郁金香枯萎在花坛里，从此以后，他每天除了忙着观察范巴尔莱家发生什么事，自己什么事都不干。他靠范巴尔莱郁金香的花茎呼吸，靠浇洒郁金香的水来解渴，靠他邻居撒在他那娇贵的球茎上的细软泥土果腹。","The house of his rival was quite open to view; a garden exposed to the sun; cabinets with glass walls, shelves, cupboards, boxes, and ticketed pigeon-holes, which could easily be surveyed by the telescope.Boxtel allowed his bulbs to rot in the pits, his seedlings to dry up in their cases, and his tulips to wither in the borders and henceforward occupied himself with nothing else but the doings at Van Baerle’s.He breathed through the stalks of Van Baerle’s tulips, quenched his thirst with the water he sprinkled upon them, and feasted on the fine soft earth which his neighbour scattered upon his cherished bulbs."
"但是他最好奇的一部分工作并不是在花园里完成的。","But the most curious part of the operations was not performed in the garden."
"大约凌晨一点范巴尔莱上楼去他的实验室，钻进一个玻璃房子，无论到哪儿，博克斯戴尔都能用他的望远镜轻松看到。只要灯光照亮了墙和窗户，博克斯戴尔就能看见他的对手——这个创造天才在工作。","It might be one o’clock in the morning when Van Baerle went up to his laboratory, into the glazed cabinet whither Boxtel’s telescope had such an easy access; and here, as soon as the lamp illuminated the walls and windows, Boxtel saw the inventive genius of his rival at work."
"他看着他筛选种子，然后把种子浸泡在液体里，那液体一定是用来改变或加深花儿颜色的。他明白科尔内留斯为什么把一些种子加热，然后让种子湿润，用一种移植法将它们和其它种子结合起来，这可是一样极为精细、需要技巧的活儿，他也了解科尔内留斯为什么把需要增加黑色的花儿关在暗处，把要生成红色的花儿放在阳光或灯光下，把希望长成白色的花儿置于水面不停地反射之下，因为白色是清澈明净的元素的纯粹再现。","He beheld him sifting his seeds, and soaking them in liquids which were destined to modify or to deepen their colours.He knew what Cornelius meant when heating certain grains, then moistening them, then combining them with others by a sort of grafting,—a minute and marvellously delicate manipulation,—and when he shut up in darkness those which were expected to furnish the black colour, exposed to the sun or to the lamp those which were to produce red, and placed between the endless reflections of two water-mirrors those intended for white, the pure representation of the limpid element."
"这无邪的魔法，是孩子气的冥想和成年人天赋的共同产物，他这样不知疲惫地耐心工作，博克斯戴尔清楚自己是没法做到的，这连同妒忌一起折磨着他，他把自己的整个生命、所有思绪以及所有希望都寄托在他的望远镜里。","This innocent magic, the fruit at the same time of child-like musings and of manly genius—this patient untiring labour, of which Boxtel knew himself to be incapable—made him, gnawed as he was with envy, centre all his life, all his thoughts, and all his hopes in his telescope."
"说也奇怪，伊萨克对园艺的热爱和兴趣并没有减弱他内心里强烈的嫉妒和复仇的渴望。有时候，当他用望远镜瞄准范巴尔莱的时候，他会自欺欺人地幻想着他举着一把永远都不会打不响的火枪对准了范巴尔莱，然后他的手指摸索到扳机，一枪打死他的邻居。但是现在我们该把科尔内留斯·德维特还乡访问的事和这两个分别在工作和窥探的人结合到一块儿说了。","For, strange to say, the love and interest of horticulture had not deadened in Isaac his fierce envy and thirst of revenge.Sometimes, whilst covering Van Baerle with his telescope, he deluded himself into a belief that he was levelling a never-failing musket at him; and then he would seek with his finger for the trigger to fire the shot which was to have killed his neighbour.But it is time that we should connect with this epoch of the operations of the one, and the espionage of the other, the visit which Cornelius de Witt came to pay to his native town."
"第七章 幸运的人交厄运","Chapter 7 The Happy Man Makes Acquaintance with Misforture"
"科尔内留斯·德维特处理完他的家事后，于一六七二年一月的一个傍晚来到了他教子科尔内留斯·范巴尔莱的家中。","Cornelius de Witt, after having attended to his family affairs, reached the house of his godson, Cornelius van Baerle, one evening in the month of January, 1672."
"德维特虽然不大懂园艺，也不了解艺术，但还是把房子转了个遍，从工作室到温室，每样东西都视察了一番，上至挂在墙上的油画，下至郁金香。他感谢他的教子曾在骚什乌德战役中陪同他登上了海军上将的船——“七省联邦号”的甲板，并感谢他的教子用他的名字给如此华丽的郁金香命名。之后他带着一个父亲对儿子的仁慈与和蔼，参观了范巴尔莱的宝贝。此时，人们好奇地、甚至是带着几分敬意地聚集在这个幸福的人的门前。","De Witt, although being very little of a horticulturist or of an artist, went over the whole mansion, from the studio to the green-house, inspecting everything, from the pictures down to the tulips.He thanked his godson for having joined him on the deck of the admiral’s ship “The Seven Provinces,” during the battle of Southwold Bay, and for having given his name to a magnificent tulip; and whilst he thus, with the kindness and affability of a father to a son, visited Van Baerle’s treasures, the crowd gathered with curiosity, and even respect, before the door of the happy man."
"人群的嘈杂声引起了正在炉边吃饭的博克斯戴尔的注意。他一打听，听说了是怎么回事后，就爬上了他的观察点，尽管那儿很冷，他还是站在那里，拿着望远镜观望。","All this hubbub excited the attention of Boxtel, who was just taking his meal by his fireside.He inquired what it meant, and, on being informed of the cause of all this stir, climbed up to his post of observation, where in spite of the cold, he took his stand, with the telescope to his eye."
"自一六七一年的秋天以来，这架望远镜就没怎么派上大用场了。这些郁金香，就像地道的东方姑娘一样畏寒，冬天不适宜留在户外的地里。他们需要房间的庇护，花架柔软的花床，还有火炉适宜的温度。因此，范巴尔莱就在他的实验室，他的书和油画之间度过了整个冬天。他很少去他存放球茎的屋子，除非偶尔有太阳，他会打开一扇活动玻璃窗，让阳光照进来。","This telescope had not been of great service to him since the autumn of 1671.The tulips, like true daughters of the East, averse to cold, do not abide in the open ground in winter.They need the shelter of the house, the soft bed on the shelves, and the congenial warmth of the stove.Van Baerle, therefore, passed the whole winter in his laboratory, in the midst of his books and pictures.He went only rarely to the room where he kept his bulbs, unless it were to allow some occasional rays of the sun to enter, by opening one of the movable sashes of the glass front."
"就在我们谈到的那天晚上，两位科尔内留斯先生一块儿参观了屋里所有的房间，同时，身后还跟着一队仆人，德维特压低声音对范巴尔莱说：","On the evening of which we are speaking, after the two Corneliuses had visited together all the apartments of the house, whilst a train of domestics followed their steps, De Witt said in a low voice to Van Baerle,—"
"“亲爱的孩子，把这群人打发走吧，好让我们单独呆会儿。”","“My dear son, send these people away, and let us be alone for some minutes.”"
"年轻的科尔内留斯赞同地点了点头，大声说：","The younger Cornelius, bowing assent, said aloud,—"
"“先生，您想去看看我的干燥室吗？”","“Would you now, sir, please to see my dry-room?”"
"干燥室是郁金香爱好者的神殿、至圣所，就像古时的特尔斐，是严禁亵渎神灵的教外人入内的。","The dry-room, this pantheon, this sanctum sanctorum of the tulip-fancier, was, as Delphi of old, interdicted to the profane uninitiated."
"他还没有哪个仆人鲁莽到敢踏入干燥室的。科尔内留斯只允许一个年迈的弗里斯兰女管家拿着不会造成损坏的扫帚进去打扫卫生。她曾是科尔内留斯的奶妈，自从他致力于培育郁金香后，她就再没敢给他的炖肉里放过洋葱，唯恐不小心把她养子挚爱的球茎当成洋葱给切得粉碎。","Never had any of his servants been bold enough to set his foot there.Cornelius admitted only the inoffensive broom of an old Frisian housekeeper, who had been his nurse, and who from the time when he had devoted himself to the culture of tulips ventured no longer to put onions in his stews, for fear of pulling to pieces and mincing the idol of her foster child."
"因此，一听到“干燥室”这三个字，那些掌灯的仆人就都毕恭毕敬地退下了。科尔内留斯从最前面的仆人的手里接过烛台，领着他的教父来到了干燥室。那间就是那个装着玻璃墙，博克斯戴尔不停地用望远镜窥探的屋子。","At the mere mention of the dry-room, therefore, the servants who were carrying the lights respectfully fell back.Cornelius, taking the candlestick from the hands of the foremost, conducted his godfather into that room, which was no other than that very cabinet with a glass front into which Boxtel was continually prying with his telescope."
"这个满怀嫉妒的密探从来没有这样专注地观望过。","The envious spy was watching more intently than ever."
"起先他看到墙和窗户都亮了。","First of all he saw the walls and windows lit up."
"随后出现了两个黑影。","Then two dark figures appeared."
"其中一个高大魁梧、表情严肃，在范巴尔莱放烛台的桌旁坐下了。","One of them, tall, majestic, stern, sat down near the table on which Van Baerle had placed the taper."
"博克斯戴尔从科尔内留斯·德维特的苍白面容认出了他，他前分的长发一直垂到肩上。","In this figure, Boxtel recognised the pale features of Cornelius de Witt, whose long hair, parted in front, fell over his shoulders."
"德维特对科尔内留斯说了几句话，窥探者只看见嘴唇在动，也猜不出说了啥。德维特从胸袋里掏出一个封得严密的白色包裹，博克斯戴尔从科尔内留斯接过包裹，放进柜子里的架势来看，估计包裹里面一定是极其重要的文件。","De Witt, after having said some few words to Cornelius, the meaning of which the prying neighbour could not read in the movement of his lips, took from his breast pocket a white parcel, carefully sealed, which Boxtel, judging from the manner in which Cornelius received it, and placed it in one of the presses, supposed to contain papers of the greatest importance."
"他原以为这包珍贵的东西定是刚从孟加拉或锡兰引进的球茎，但他马上想到科尔内留斯·德维特并不热衷于郁金香培植。他一心扑在关乎“人”的事业上，他的职业远没有花卉研究者的工作来得平静惬意。他因此得出结论：这个包裹不过装着些文件，而且和政治有关。","His first thought was that this precious deposit enclosed some newly imported bulbs from Bengal or Ceylon; but he soon reflected that Cornelius de Witt was very little addicted to tulip-growing, and that he only occupied himself with the affairs of man, a pursuit by far less peaceful and agreeable than that of the florist.He therefore came to the conclusion that the parcel contained simply some papers, and that these papers were relating to politics."
"但为什么德维特要把这些和政治相关的文件托付给范巴尔莱呢？要知道范巴尔莱不仅对政治一窍不通，他甚至还引以为豪。在他看来，这门学问比炼金术还悬乎。","But why should papers of political import be intrusted to Van Baerle, who not only was, but also boasted of being, an entire stranger to the science of government, which, in his opinion, was more occult than alchemy itself?"
"毋庸置疑，科尔内留斯·德维特是迫于他不得国人民心的形势，才把这包东西交到他教子的手中。他这个主意想得实在是太绝了，因为人们绝不可能跑到一个远离各种政治阴谋的人的家中去搜这包东西。","It was undoubtedly a deposit which Cornelius de Witt, already threatened by the unpopularity with which his countrymen were going to honour him, was placing in the hands of his godson; a contrivance so much the more cleverly devised, as it certainly was not at all likely that it should be searched for at the house of one who had always stood aloof from every sort of intrigue."
"而且，如果这个包裹里包的真是球茎的话，博克斯戴尔太了解他的邻居了，范巴尔莱一定会迫不及待地打开他刚收到的礼物，以满足他的好奇心，好好欣赏一番。","And, besides, if the parcel had been made up of bulbs, Boxtel knew his neighbour too well not to expect that Van Baerle would not have lost one moment in satisfying his curiosity and feasting his eyes on the present which he had received."
"但恰恰相反，科尔内留斯郑重其事地从他的教父手里接过包裹，又郑重其事地把它放到抽屉里，妥善收好，这样就不会占用太多他用来放球茎的空间。","But, on the contrary, Cornelius had received the parcel from the hands of his godfather with every mark of respect, and put it by with the same respectful manner in a drawer, stowing it away so that it should not take up too much of the room which was reserved to his bulbs."
"这个包裹就这样被藏好了。科尔内留斯起身握了握他教子的手，转身朝门走去，范巴尔莱拿着烛台为他照亮路，一直将他送到了门口，那里还围着不少人，等着看他们伟大的同乡上马车。","The parcel thus being secreted, Cornelius de Witt got up, pressed the hand of his godson, and turned towards the door, Van Baerle seizing the candlestick, and lighting him on his way down to the street, which was still crowded with people who wished to see their great fellow citizen getting into his coach."
"博克斯戴尔没有猜错。那包交给范巴尔莱，并由他妥善保管的东西不是别的，就是约翰·德维特和法国国王的国防大臣德卢瓦侯爵的来往信件。教父对这个秘密的政治重要性绝口不提，只是要求教子不要把包裹交给任何人，除了他本人或是他派去以他的名义取包裹的人。","Boxtel had not been mistaken in his supposition.The deposit intrusted to Van Baerle, and carefully locked up by him, was nothing more nor less than John de Witt’s correspondence with the Marquis de Louvois, the war minister of the King of France; only the godfather forbore giving to his godson the least intimation concerning the political importance of the secret, merely desiring him not to deliver the parcel to any one but to himself, or to whomsoever he should send to claim it in his name."
"正如我们所看到的，范巴尔莱将包裹和他珍贵的球茎锁在一起。教父离开后，他也没有多想。倒是博克斯戴尔一直寻思着这包裹的来由，就像一个机灵的舵手看着远处不易察觉的云彩，翻腾聚集，挟着暴风雨一点点临近。","And Van Baerle, as we have seen, locked it up with his most precious bulbs, to think no more of it, after his godfather had left him; very unlike Boxtel, who looked upon this parcel as a clever pilot does on the distant and scarcely perceptible cloud which is increasing on its way and which is fraught with a storm."
"范巴尔莱对他邻居的嫉妒和仇恨毫不知情，他正一步步朝着哈勒姆园艺协会提供的奖项走近。他的花儿已经由深榛子色发展到炒咖啡豆的颜色，就在我们前面几章提到的在海牙发生的骇人听闻的事件的那一天，下午一点左右，我们看到他在他的花坛里，从炒咖啡豆色的郁金香上采集鳞茎，这些鳞茎有望在一六七五年的春天第一次开花，而且开出的无疑会是哈勒姆协会要求的大黑郁金香。　","Little dreaming of the jealous hatred of his neighbour, Van Baerle had proceeded step by step towards gaining the prize offered by the Horticultural Society of Haarlem.He had progressed from hazel-nut shade to that of roasted coffee, and on the very day when the frightful events took place at the Hague which we have related in the preceding chapters, we find him, about one o’clock in the day, gathering from the border the young suckers raised from tulips of the colour of roasted coffee; and which, being expected to flower for the first time in the spring of 1675, would undoubtedly produce the large black tulip required by the Haarlem Society."
"一六七二年八月二十日下午一点钟，科尔内留斯正在它的干燥室，双脚搁在桌子的踏杆上，两肘撑在桌面上，满怀欣喜地看着他刚刚从母体球茎上分离下来的鳞茎，它们纯净、完美无缺，从它们身上将会生长出园艺界的精灵，黑郁金香会让他科尔内留斯·范巴尔莱的名字流芳百世。","On the 20th of August, 1672, at one o’clock, Cornelius was therefore in his dry-room, with his feet resting on the foot-bar of the table, and his elbows on the cover, looking with intense delight on three suckers which he had just detached from the mother bulb, pure, perfect, and entire, and from which was to grow that wonderful produce of horticulture which would render the name of Cornelius van Baerle for ever illustrious."
"“我会培育出黑郁金香的。”科尔内留斯边自言自语，边分离鳞茎。“我会得到协会十万基尔德的奖励的。我会把钱分给多特的穷人，这样在国内战争时期穷人对富人的仇恨就会得到缓解，我也可以像以前一样，把我的花坛保持完好，也不用害怕共和派或奥兰治派的破坏了。我也不用担心，万一某天发生暴乱，城里的店主和港口的水手们会来拔我的球茎，把球茎当作洋葱煮给他们的家人吃，因为当他们碰巧想起我花两三百基尔德买一个球茎时，有时也会暗地里吓唬我。所以就这么定了，我把哈勒姆奖的十万基尔德给穷人。可是——”","“I shall find the black tulip,” said Cornelius to himself, whilst detaching the suckers.“I shall obtain the hundred thousand guilders offered by the Society.I shall distribute them among the poor of Dort; and thus the hatred which every rich man has to encounter in times of civil wars will be soothed down, and I shall be able, without fearing any harm either from Republicans or Orangists, to keep as heretofore my borders in splendid condition.I need no more be afraid lest on the day of a riot the shopkeepers of the town and the sailors of the port should come and tear out my bulbs, to boil them as onions for their families, as they have sometimes quietly threatened when they happened to remember my having paid two or three hundred guilders for one bulb.It is therefore settled I shall give the hundred thousand guilders of the Haarlem prize to-the poor.And yet—”"
"说到这里，科尔内留斯停顿了，叹了口气。“可是，”他继续说道，“要是我用这十万基尔德扩建我的郁金香花圃，或是去东方——美丽鲜花的国度走一趟，那该多开心啊。可是，哎！在这样一个时代不该有这样的想法，现在的社会可是火枪、军旗、宣言和擂擂战鼓大行其道。”","Here Cornelius stopped and heaved a sigh.“And yet,” he continued, “it would have been so very delightful to spend the hundred thousand guilders on the enlargement of my tulip-bed or even on a journey to the East, the country of beautiful flowers.But, alas! these are no thoughts for the present times, when muskets, standards, proclamations, and beating of drums are the order of the day.”"
"范巴尔莱仰头望天，又叹了一口气。然后低头看了一眼他的球茎，那东西对他来说，可比火枪、军旗、战鼓和宣言重要得多，在他看来，后者只会让单纯的人心烦意乱，他说：　","Van Baerle raised his eyes to heaven and sighed again.Then turning his glance towards his bulbs,—objects of much greater importance to him than all those muskets, standards, drums, and proclamations, which he conceived only to be fit to disturb the minds of honest people,—he said:—"
"“瞧，多美的球茎，它们多么光滑，形态多么优美，还透着一丝忧郁的气息，就是这气息能保证它们开出像乌木一样黑的花儿。你甚至用肉眼都看不出它们表皮的脉络。当然，绝对不会有一个斑点，那样会毁了我一手创造的郁金香。我度过了多少不眠之夜，耗费了多少心血和汗水才孕育出这个结晶，我该叫它什么名字呢？叫巴尔莱氏黑郁金香？","“These are, indeed, beautiful bulbs; how smooth they are, how well formed; there is that air of melancholy about them which promises to produce a flower of the colour of ebony.On their skin you cannot even distinguish the circulating veins with the naked eye.Certainly, certainly, not a light spot will disfigure the tulip which I have called into existence.And by what name shall we call this offspring of my sleepless nights, of my labour and my thought?Tulipa nigra Barlaensis?"
"“对，就叫巴尔莱氏，这名字不错。‘有人培育出了大黑郁金香！’这消息要是传遍了世界各地，整个郁金香培植界，也就是说，全欧洲的聪明人都会为之而振奋。‘花儿叫什么？’郁金香迷会问。——‘巴尔莱氏黑郁金香！’‘——为什么叫那名字？——’‘因为他的培育者叫范巴尔莱。’人们会这样回答。——‘那谁是范巴尔莱呢？’‘——就是那个已经培育出“雅内”、“约翰·德维特”、“科尔内留斯·德维特”等五个郁金香新品种的人。’这就是我的理想。它不会伤害任何人。也许等到我的教父，这个伟大的政治家，还是因为我的花取了他的名字才有人知道他的时候，人们还会谈论我的巴尔莱氏黑郁金香。","“Yes Barlaensis: a fine name.All the tulip-fanciers—that is to say, all the intelligent people of Europe—will feel a thrill of excitement when the rumour spreads to the four quarters of the globe: The grand black tulip is found!‘How is it called?’ the fanciers will ask.—’Tulipa nigra Barlaensis!’—‘Why Barlaensis?’—‘After its grower, Van Baerle,’ will be the answer.—’And who is this Van Baerle?’—‘It is the same who has already produced five new tulips: the Jane, the John de Witt, the Cornelius de Witt, etc.’Well, that is what I call my ambition.It will cause tears to no one.And people will talk of my Tulipa nigra Barlaensis when perhaps my godfather, this sublime politician, is only known from the tulip to which I have given his name."
"“啊！我心爱的球茎啊！","“Oh! these darling bulbs!"
"“要是我的黑郁金香开了，”巴尔莱继续自言自语道，“而且荷兰又恢复了平静，我就只给穷人五万基尔德，毕竟这笔钱对没有任何义务的人来说，已经是一笔很可观的数目了。这样，我可以用剩下的五万基尔德做实验。有了这钱，我可以让我的郁金香具有特定的香味。啊！如果我成功地让我的郁金香具有玫瑰或康乃馨的芬芳，或者一种全新的香味，那再好不过了。这百花之王千里迢迢从东方来到欧洲，登上了他的王位，却逐渐丧失了他的芳香，相信在印度群岛的果阿、孟买、马德拉斯，尤其是那个古昔被称为‘人间天堂’，现在叫锡兰的地方，那里的郁金香一定还有芳香，如果我能恢复他独一无二的自然芳香，那将是何等荣耀啊！我一定会说，我情愿当科尔内留斯·范巴尔莱，也不愿做亚历山大、恺撒或马克西米利安。”","“When my tulip has flowered,” Baerle continued in his soliloquy, “and when tranquillity is restored in Holland, I shall give to the poor only fifty thousand guilders, which, after all, is a goodly sum for a man who is under no obligation whatever.Then, with the remaining fifty thousand guilders, I shall make experiments.With them I shall succeed in imparting scent to the tulip.Ah! if I succeed in giving it the odour of the rose or the carnation, or, what would be still better, a completely new scent; if I restored to this queen of flowers its natural distinctive perfume, which she has lost in passing from her Eastern to her European throne, and which she must have in the Indian peninsula at Goa, Bombay, and Madras, and especially in that island which in olden times, as is asserted, was the terrestrial paradise, and which is called Ceylon,—oh, what glory!I must say, I would then rather be Cornelius van Baerle than Alexander, Caesar, or Maximilian."
"“绝妙的球茎啊！”","“Oh the admirable bulbs!”"
"科尔内留斯沉浸在冥想的喜悦之中，思绪因为最甜蜜的梦想飘到了九霄云外。","Thus Cornelius indulged in the delights of contemplation, and was carried away by the sweetest dreams."
"突然，他的门铃响了，铃声比往常要急促。","Suddenly the bell of his cabinet was rung much more violently than usual."
"科尔内留斯惊愕中把手按在球茎上，回过头去。","Cornelius, startled, laid his hands on his bulbs, and turned round."
"“谁？”他问。","“Who is here?” he asked."
"“先生，”仆人回答，“从海牙来了一个信使。”","“Sir,” answered the servant, “it is a messenger from the Hague.”"
"“海牙来的信使？　他来干什么的？”","“A messenger from the Hague!What does he want?”"
"“先生，是克莱克。”","“Sir, it is Craeke.”"
"“克莱克！就是约翰·德维特先生的贴身仆人吗？好的，请他稍等。”","“Craeke! the confidential servant of Mynheer John de Witt?Good, let him wait.”"
"“我等不了了。”大厅里一个声音说。","“I cannot wait,” said a voice in the lobby."
"说着克莱克就强行进入，冲进了干燥室。","And at the same time forcing his way in, Craeke rushed into the dry-room."
"克莱克这样唐突地闯进来完全违反了科尔内留斯·范巴尔莱家中的成规，所以科尔内留斯一看见克莱克进来，捂着球茎的手痉挛般地抖动了一下，结果有两个掉到地上，一个滚进了小桌子下面，另一个进了壁炉。","This abrupt entrance was such an infringement on the established rules of the household of Cornelius van Baerle, that the latter, at the sight of Craeke, almost convulsively moved his hand which covered the bulbs, so that two of them fell on the floor, one of them rolling under a small table, and the other into the fireplace."
"“该死的！”科尔内留斯说，想赶紧去拾他珍贵的球茎，“到底发生什么事了？”","“Zounds!” said Cornelius, eagerly picking up his precious bulbs, “what’s the matter?”"
"“阁下，情况是，”克莱克边说，边把一张纸展开在放着第三个球茎的大桌上，“情况是，您必须立即读这张纸条，刻不容缓。”","“The matter, sir!” said Craeke, laying a paper on the large table, on which the third bulb was lying,—“the matter is, that you are requested to read this paper without losing one moment.”"
"克莱克认为，他来的路上注意到多特的街头有着近似于他离开海牙时目睹的骚乱迹象，所以他头也不回地跑了。","And Craeke, who thought he had remarked in the streets of Dort symptoms of a tumult similar to that which he had witnessed before his departure from the Hague, ran off without even looking behind him."
"“好的！好的！亲爱的克莱克，”科尔内留斯说着，伸长了胳膊够桌下的球茎，“你的条子我会读的，我当然会读的。”","“All right! all right! my dear Craeke,” said Cornelius, stretching his arm under the table for the bulb; “your paper shall be read, indeed it shall.”"
"然后，他把球茎放在手心细细地检查，说：“还好，这一个还是好的。这个讨厌的克莱克！就这样闯进了我的干燥室！我们来找找另一个吧。”","Then, examining the bulb which he held in the hollow of his hand, he said: “Well, here is one of them uninjured.That confounded Craeke! thus to rush into my dry-room; let us now look after the other.”"
"巴尔莱手里的球茎还没搁在桌上，就来到壁炉边，跪下来，用手指尖搅了搅灰烬，幸好灰烬是冷的。","And without laying down the bulb which he already held, Baerle went to the fireplace, knelt down and stirred with the tip of his finger the ashes, which fortunately were quite cold."
"他立马摸到了另一个球茎。","He at once felt the other bulb."
"“好的，找到了。”他说，几乎带着父亲般的慈爱看了看球茎，大声说，“跟第一个一样，没摔坏！”","“Well, here it is,” he said; and, looking at it with almost fatherly affection, he exclaimed, “Uninjured as the first!”"
"就在这一刻，科尔内留斯还跪在地上检查他的宝贝，干燥室的门猛烈地震动着，紧接着就被撞开了，科尔内留斯顿时觉得邪恶的愤怒之火烧到了他的脸颊和耳根。","At this very instant, and whilst Cornelius, still on his knees, was examining his pets, the door of the dry-room was so violently shaken, and opened in such a brusque manner, that Cornelius felt rising in his cheeks and his ears the glow of that evil counsellor which is called wrath."
"“又怎么了？”他问，“今天这儿的人是不是疯了？”","“Now, what is it again,” he demanded; “are people going mad here?”"
"“啊，先生！先生！”一个仆人边喊边冲进干燥室，比先前的克莱克脸色更苍白，更惊慌失措。","“Oh, sir! sir!” cried the servant, rushing into the dry-room with a much paler face and with a much more frightened mien than Craeke had shown."
"“到底什么事？”科尔内留斯问，家里的严规接连被违反，他预感到一定会有麻烦。","“Well!” asked Cornelius, foreboding some mischief from the double breach of the strict rule of his house."
"“先生，逃吧！快点逃吧！”仆人大声说。","“Oh, sir, fly! fly quick!” cried the servant."
"“逃！为什么？”","“Fly! and what for?”"
"“先生，房子里都是国会的卫兵。”","“Sir, the house is full of the guards of the States.”"
"“他们要干嘛？”","“What do they want?”"
"“来找你。”","“They want you.”"
"“找我做什么？”","“What for?”"
"“他们要逮捕你。”","“To arrest you.”"
"“逮捕我？你是说要逮捕我？”","“Arrest me? arrest me, do you say?”"
"“是的，先生，一位法官领着他们来的。”","“Yes, sir, and they are headed by a magistrate.”"
"“这是要干什么？”范巴尔莱说，手里还攥着两个球茎，他惊慌地朝楼梯瞟了一眼。","“What’s the meaning of all this?” said Van Baerle, grasping in his hands the two bulbs, and directing his terrified glance towards the staircase."
"“他们上来了！他们上来了！”仆人喊道。","“They are coming up! they are coming up!” cried the servant."
"“我亲爱的孩子，我尊敬的主人！”年迈的女管家也来到干燥室，大声说，“带上你的金银珠宝，赶紧逃吧，逃吧！”","“Oh, my dear child, my worthy master!” cried the old housekeeper, who now likewise made her appearance in the dry-room, “take your gold, your jewelry, and fly, fly!”"
"“可我怎么逃呢，奶妈？”范巴尔莱说。","“But how shall I make my escape, nurse?” said Van Baerle."
"“从窗户跳出去。”","“Jump out of the window.”"
"“那有二十五英尺高呢！”","“Twenty-five feet from the ground!”"
"“可你会落到六英尺厚的软土上！”","“But you will fall on six feet of soft soil!”"
"“没错儿，可我可能会压坏我的郁金香。”","“Yes, but I should fall on my tulips.”"
"“没事的，跳吧。”","“Never mind, jump out.”"
"科尔内留斯拿起第三个球茎，过去把窗户打开，但他一想到他必定会给他的花坛带来的毁坏，不仅如此，他还得蹦二十五英尺的高度，他大声说：“我决不跳！”说着往后退了一步。","Cornelius took the third bulb, approached the window and opened it, but seeing what havoc he would necessarily cause in his borders, and, more than this, what a height he would have to jump, he called out, “Never!” and fell back a step."
"这时候，他们隔着楼梯的扶手看到士兵手里举着的戟尖。","At this moment they saw across the banister of the staircase the points of the halberds of the soldiers rising."
"女管家朝天举起了双手。","The housekeeper raised her hands to heaven."
"至于科尔内留斯·范巴尔莱，作为一个郁金香爱好者，而不是一个普通人，我们应该赞扬他一番，他当时唯一想到的就是他那无价之宝——球茎。","As to Cornelius van Baerle, it must be stated to his honour, not as a man, but as a tulip-fancier, his only thought was for his inestimable bulbs."
"他想找张纸把球茎包住，看到克莱克放在桌上的那张从《圣经》撕下来的扉页，慌乱中他想都没想这纸从哪里来的，就把三个球茎包了起来，藏在怀里等着。","Looking about for a paper in which to wrap them up, he noticed the fly-leaf from the Bible, which Craeke had laid upon the table, took it without in his confusion remembering whence it came, folded in it the three bulbs, secreted them in his bosom, and waited."
"就在这一刹那，一个法官领着一群士兵进来了。","At this very moment the soldiers, preceded by a magistrate, entered the room."
"“你是科尔内留斯·范巴尔莱博士吗？”治安官问，他明明认识这个年轻人，但他按法律程序提这个问题，不过是为了让他的执法显得更庄严些。","“Are you Dr. Cornelius van Baerle?” demanded the magistrate (who, although knowing the young man very well, put his question according to the forms of justice, which gave his proceedings a much more dignified air)."
"“在下就是，范斯邦朗法官，”科尔内留斯客气地对法官说，“这点您很清楚。”","“I am that person, Master van Spennen,” answered Cornelius, politely, to his judge, “and you know it very well.”"
"“那就把你藏在你家的谋反的文件交给我们。”","“Then give up to us the seditious papers which you secrete in your house.”"
"“谋反的文件？”科尔内留斯重复着，他被这个罪名惊得目瞪口呆。","“The seditious papers!” repeated Cornelius, quite dumfounded at the imputation."
"“别故作惊讶了，拜托！”","“Now don’t look astonished, if you please.”"
"“范斯邦朗法官，我对您发誓，我根本不清楚您想要什么。”科尔内留斯回答。","“I vow to you, Master van Spennen,” Cornelius replied, “that I am completely at a loss to understand what you want.”"
"“那我就给你提示一下，博士，”法官说，“把卖国贼科尔内留斯·德维特今年一月份托你保管的文件交给我们。”","“Then I shall put you in the way, Doctor,” said the judge; “give up to us the papers which the traitor Cornelius de Witt deposited with you in the month of January last.”"
"科尔内留斯忽然明白了。","A sudden light came into the mind of Cornelius."
"“啊呀！”范斯邦朗说，“你现在记起来了，对吧？”","“Halloa!” said Van Spennen, “you begin now to remember, don’t you?”"
"“是的，我想起来了，但您说的谋反的文件，我这里可没有。”","“Indeed I do, but you spoke of seditious papers, and I have none of that sort.”"
"“你还否认？”","“You deny it then?”"
"“我当然否认了。”","“Certainly I do.”"
"法官转身，匆匆扫了一眼整个房间。","The magistrate turned round and took a rapid survey of the whole cabinet."
"“那个你叫干燥室的房间在哪儿？”他问。","“Where is the apartment you call your dry-room?” he asked."
"“就是您现在所在的房间，范斯邦朗法官。”","“The very same where you now are, Master van Spennen.”"
"法官瞟了一眼他手中文件上面的小便条。","The magistrate cast a glance at a small note at the top of his papers."
"“很好。”他胸有成竹地说。","“All right,” he said, like a man who is sure of his ground."
"接着，他转身对科尔内留斯说：“那你愿意把那些文件交给我吗？”","Then, turning round towards Cornelius, he continued, “Will you give up those papers to me?”"
"“可我不能交啊，范斯邦朗法官，那些文件不是我的，是出于信任才由我保管的，而且信任是神圣不可侵犯的。”","“But I cannot, Master van Spennen; those papers do not belong to me; they have been deposited with me as a trust, and a trust is sacred.”"
"“科尔内留斯医生，”法官说，“我以国会的名义命令你，把这个抽屉打开，把里面的文件交给我。”","“Dr. Cornelius,” said the judge, “in the name of the States, I order you to open this drawer, and to give up to me the papers which it contains.”"
"他边说边用手指着靠近壁炉柜子的的第三个抽屉。","Saying this, the judge pointed with his finger to the third drawer of the press, near the fireplace."
"这个抽屉里的确存放着海堤监察官交给他教子保管的文件，这说明警察已经收到了确凿的消息。","In this very drawer, indeed the papers deposited by the Warden of the Dikes with his godson were lying; a proof that the police had received very exact information."
"“哈！你不肯，”范斯邦朗看见科尔尼留斯困惑地站在那里一动不动，说，“那好吧，我亲自打开。”","“Ah! you will not,” said Van Spennen, when he saw Cornelius standing immovable and bewildered, “then I shall open the drawer myself.”"
"法官把抽屉完全打开，首先映入眼帘的落是二十来个摆放整齐、贴着标签的球茎，然后才是那个纸包，纸包还跟不幸的科尔内留斯·德维特交给他教子的时候一模一样。","And, pulling out the drawer to its full length, the magistrate at first alighted on about twenty bulbs, carefully arranged and ticketed, and then on the paper parcel, which had remained in exactly the same state as it was when delivered by the unfortunate Cornelius de Witt to his godson."
"法官破掉封蜡，匆匆拆开信封，急切地瞥了一眼眼前的头几页，用恐怖的声音喊道：","The magistrate broke the seals, tore off the envelope, cast an eager glance on the first leaves which met his eye and then exclaimed, in a terrible voice,—"
"“怎么样，法院还是得到了正确的情报！”","“Well, justice has been rightly informed after all!”"
"“怎么会呢？”科尔内留斯说，“这是怎么回事？”","“How,” said Cornelius, “how is this?”"
"“你别装作你对此一无所知，范巴尔莱先生。”法官说。“跟我走吧！”","“Don’t pretend to be ignorant, Mynheer van Baerle,” answered the magistrate.“Follow me.”"
"“怎么回事！要我跟你走？”医生喊道。","“How’s that! follow you?” cried the Doctor."
"“是的，先生，我以国会的名义逮捕你。”","“Yes, sir, for in the name of the States I arrest you.”"
"当时的逮捕令还不是以奥兰治亲王威廉的名义下达的；他当总督的时间还不够长。","Arrests were not as yet made in the name of William of Orange; he had not been Stadtholder long enough for that."
"“逮捕我！”科尔尼留斯叫着，“我犯什么罪了？”","“Arrest me!” cried Cornelius; “but what have I done?”"
"“这就不是我的事情了，博士。你还是在法官面前解释这一切吧！”","“That’s no affair of mine, Doctor; you will explain all that before your judges.”"
"“我跟你去哪儿？”","“Where?”"
"“去海牙。”","“At the Hague.”"
"科尔内留斯恍惚中，默不出声地拥抱了不省人事的奶妈，和哭成泪人的仆人握手告别，就跟着法官走了。法官把他当成政治犯关在马车里，疾速朝海牙奔去。","Cornelius, in mute stupefaction, embraced his old nurse, who was in a swoon; shook hands with his servants, who were bathed in tears, and followed the magistrate, who put him in a coach as a prisoner of state and had him driven at full gallop to the Hague."
"第八章 入侵","Chapter 8 An Invasion"
"读者之前或许已经猜到了，刚才发生的事都是伊萨克·博克斯戴尔先生居心叵测的阴谋。","The incident just related was, as the reader has guessed before this, the diabolical work of Mynheer Isaac Boxtel."
"大家还记得，博克斯戴尔通过他那架望远镜，科尔内留斯·德维特和范巴尔莱会面的细节一丝一毫都没有逃过他的眼睛。他的确什么都没听到，可是他看见了一切，他也准确地判断出监察官交给医生托管的文件一定非常重要，因为他瞧见范巴尔莱小心谨慎地把包裹藏在他以前存放他极其宝贵的球茎的抽屉里。","It will be remembered that, with the help of his telescope, not even the least detail of the private meeting between Cornelius de Witt and Van Baerle had escaped him.He had, indeed, heard nothing, but he had seen everything, and had rightly concluded that the papers intrusted by the Warden to the Doctor must have been of great importance, as he saw Van Baerle so carefully secreting the parcel in the drawer where he used to keep his most precious bulbs."
"结果是，博克斯戴尔远比他的邻居科尔内留斯要关注政治，当他得知德维特兄弟因叛国罪被逮捕的时候，心里就盘算着，很可能他只须开口说一句话，这个教子就会和他的教父一样被逮捕。","The upshot of all this was that when Boxtel, who watched the course of political events much more attentively than his neighbour Cornelius was used to do, heard the news of the brothers De Witt being arrested on a charge of high treason against the States, he thought within his heart that very likely he needed only to say one word, and the godson would be arrested as well as the godfather."
"碰到这样千载难逢的机会，博克斯戴尔心里充满了喜悦，然而最初，他一想到告发后，可能会把那个人送上断头台，还有些打退堂鼓。","Yet, full of happiness as was Boxtel’s heart at the chance, he at first shrank with horror from the idea of informing against a man whom this information might lead to the scaffold."
"但是邪念的可怕之处在于，坏人很快便会坦然受之。","But there is this terrible thing in evil thoughts, that evil minds soon grow familiar with them."
"而且，伊萨克·博克斯戴尔先生还用如下诡辩鼓舞自己：","Besides this, Mynheer Isaac Boxtel encouraged himself with the following sophism:—"
"“科尔内留斯·德维特被控叛国，而且还被逮捕了，自然是个坏公民。","“Cornelius de Witt is a bad citizen, as he is charged with high treason, and arrested."
"“而我，在这世界上没受到任何指控，自由的就像天堂的空气，我自然是个好公民。","“I, on the contrary, am a good citizen, as I am not charged with anything in the world, as I am as free as the air of heaven."
"“所以，如果科尔内留斯·德维特是个坏公民的话——这点已经勿庸置疑了，因为他被控叛国罪，而且已经被逮捕了——他的帮凶，科尔内留斯·范巴尔莱一定也好不到哪里去。","“If, therefore, Cornelius de Witt is a bad citizen,—of which there can be no doubt, as he is charged with high treason, and arrested,—his accomplice, Cornelius van Baerle, is no less a bad citizen than himself."
"“我是一位好公民，而且检举坏人是每一位好公民应尽的责任，所以我有义务检举科尔内留斯·范巴尔莱。”","“And, as I am a good citizen, and as it is the duty of every good citizen to inform against the bad ones, it is my duty to inform against Cornelius van Baerle.”"
"尽管这种推理方式听起来似是而非，但它也许还不会完全控制博克斯戴尔，要不是嫉妒之恶与贪婪之恶联手，他或许也不会屈服于啮噬他心灵的复仇欲望。","Specious as this mode of reasoning might sound, it would not perhaps have taken so complete a hold of Boxtel, nor would he perhaps have yielded to the mere desire of vengeance which was gnawing at his heart, had not the demon of envy been joined with that of cupidity."
"博克斯戴尔非常清楚，范巴尔莱已经离培植出大黑郁金香的目标越来越近了。","Boxtel was quite aware of the progress which Van Baerle had made towards producing the grand black tulip."
"科尔内留斯医生尽管为人谦逊，但他从不曾向他最亲密的朋友隐瞒他几乎唾手可得的成功——公元一六七三年，他将得到哈勒姆园艺协会提供的十万基尔德的奖金。","Dr. Cornelius, notwithstanding all his modesty, had not been able to hide from his most intimate friends that he was all but certain to win, in the year of grace 1673, the prize of a hundred thousand guilders offered by the Horticultural Society of Haarlem."
"正是因为科尔内留斯·范巴尔莱的成竹在胸才让伊萨克·博克斯戴尔怒火中烧。","It was just this certainty of Cornelius van Baerle that caused the fever which raged in the heart of Isaac Boxtel."
"如果科尔内留斯被捕，他的家里一定会乱得一团糟，而且他被捕的那个晚上，没有谁会想到要守着花园里的郁金香。","If Cornelius should be arrested there would necessarily be a great upset in his house, and during the night after his arrest no one would think of keeping watch over the tulips in his garden."
"博克斯戴尔就可以趁那个晚上，翻过院墙，把培植大黑郁金香的球茎偷过来，因为他知道球茎在哪儿，这样球茎就会为他伊萨克，而不是科尔内留斯开花儿。而且，他还能取代范巴尔莱，获得十万基尔德的奖金，更不用说以他的名字命名新品种博克斯戴尔氏黑郁金香的无限荣耀了。这个结果既可以让他复仇，还能满足他的贪婪和野心。","Now in that night Boxtel would climb over the wall and, as he knew the position of the bulb which was to produce the grand black tulip, he would filch it; and instead of flowering for Cornelius, it would flower for him, Isaac; he also, instead of Van Baerle, would have the prize of a hundred thousand guilders, not to speak of the sublime honour of calling the new flower Tulipa nigra Boxtellensis,—a result which would satisfy not only his vengeance, but also his cupidity and his ambition."
"醒着时，他想到的只有大黑郁金香；睡着时，他梦到的还是大黑郁金香。","Awake, he thought of nothing but the grand black tulip; asleep, he dreamed of it."
"终于，八月十九日下午两点左右，诱惑在内心不断膨胀，伊萨克先生再也没能抵制住它。","At last, on the 19th of August, about two o’clock in the afternoon, the temptation grew so strong, that Mynheer Isaac was no longer able to resist it."
"于是他写了一封匿名揭发信，虽无真凭实据，但内容却捏造的十分详实，随后他把信寄了出去。","Accordingly, he wrote an anonymous information, the minute exactness of which made up for its want of authenticity, and posted his letter."
"即使是投在威尼斯铜狮子嘴里的恶毒的纸条，也不会这么快产生可怕的效应。","Never did a venomous paper, slipped into the jaws of the bronze lions at Venice, produce a more prompt and terrible effect."
"就在那天晚上，主法官收到了信，他立即召集他的同僚第二天一大早开会。因此，第二天早上，他们开会决定逮捕范巴尔莱，并把此命令交给范斯邦朗法官执行，我们也看到了，斯邦朗法官像一个真正的荷兰人那样，不折不扣地履行了他的职责，他逮捕博士的时候，海牙的奥兰治派还在烤着从德维特兄弟尸体上割下来的血淋淋的肉片。","On the same evening the letter reached the principal magistrate, who without a moment’s delay convoked his colleagues early for the next morning.On the following morning, therefore, they assembled, and decided on Van Baerle’s arrest, placing the order for its execution in the hands of Master van Spennen, who, as we have seen, performed his duty like a true Hollander, and who arrested the Doctor at the very hour when the Orange party at the Hague were roasting the bleeding shreds of flesh torn from the corpses of Cornelius and John de Witt."
"但不知是出于羞愧还是心虚，伊萨克·博克斯戴尔那天没敢用他的望远镜去看花园、实验室或干燥室。","But, whether from a feeling of shame or from craven weakness, Isaac Boxtel did not venture that day to point his telescope either at the garden, or at the laboratory, or at the dry-room."
"他很清楚这个可怜的医生家里将要发生什么，所以他根本不想观望了。他唯一的仆人进他卧室的时候，他甚至都没起床。他仆人非常忌妒科尔内留斯仆人的好命，那程度不亚于博克斯戴尔忌妒那些仆人的主人。他对他仆人说：","He knew too well what was about to happen in the house of the poor doctor to feel any desire to look into it.He did not even get up when his only servant—who envied the lot of the servants of Cornelius just as bitterly as Boxtel did that of their master—entered his bedroom.He said to the man,—"
"“我今天不起床了，我病了。”","“I shall not get up to-day, I am ill.”"
"大约九点钟，他听到街头巨大的嘈杂声，不禁浑身发抖，这时候，他的脸色恐怕比真正的病人还要苍白，抖得比发着高烧的人还要厉害。","About nine o’clock he heard a great noise in the street which made him tremble, at this moment he was paler than a real invalid, and shook more violently than a man in the height of fever."
"他的仆人进来了，博克斯戴尔躲在床单里。","His servant entered the room; Boxtel hid himself under the counterpane."
"“先生，”仆人叫道，他意识到，当他悲叹范巴尔莱遭遇的不幸时，事实上他是在给他的主人汇报喜讯，“啊，先生！那么，您还不知道现在发生什么事了吧？”","“Oh, sir!” cried the servant, not without some inkling that, whilst deploring the mishap which had befallen Van Baerle, he was announcing agreeable news to his master,—“oh, sir! you do not know, then, what is happening at this moment?”"
"“我怎么会知道呢？”博克斯戴尔说，声音让人捉摸不透。","“How can I know it?” answered Boxtel, with an almost unintelligible voice."
"“哎呀，博克斯戴尔先生，现在您的邻居科尔尼留斯·范巴尔莱因叛国罪被逮捕了。”","“Well, Mynheer Boxtel, at this moment your neighbour Cornelius van Baerle is arrested for high treason.”"
"“瞎说！”博克斯戴尔支吾地低声说，“这不可能。”","“Nonsense!” Boxtel muttered, with a faltering voice; “the thing is impossible.”"
"“真的，先生，至少人们都这么说的，而且，我刚刚看见范斯邦朗法官带着弓箭手进了他家呢。”","“Faith, sir, at any rate that’s what people say; and, besides, I have seen Judge van Spennen with the archers entering the house.”"
"“噢，如果你是亲眼所见，那就另当别论了。”","“Well, if you have seen it with your own eyes, that’s a different case altogether.”"
"“不管怎样，我还是再去打听打听。放心吧，先生，我回来给您一个全面的汇报。”","“At all events,” said the servant, “I shall go and inquire once more.Be you quiet, sir, I shall let you know all about it.”"
"博克斯戴尔没吱声，算是默许了他仆人的热忱，为此，他很满意。","Boxtel contented himself with signifying his approval of the zeal of his servant by dumb show."
"仆人出去了，半个小时后回来了。","The man went out, and returned in half an hour."
"“先生，我刚才跟您说的可是千真万确。”","“Oh, sir, all that I told you is indeed quite true.”"
"“到底怎么回事？”","“How so?”"
"“范巴尔莱先生被捕了，他被塞进了一辆马车，押往海牙呢。”","“Mynheer van Baerle is arrested, and has been put into a carriage, and they are driving him to the Hague.”"
"“押往海牙！”","“To the Hague!”"
"“是啊，押往海牙，要是别人说的是真的，这下他可凶多吉少了。”","“Yes, to the Hague, and if what people say is true, it won’t do him much good.”"
"“他们说什么了？”博克斯戴尔问。","“And what do they say?” Boxtel asked."
"“哎呀，先生，他们说——不过这消息不一定可靠——这会儿，海牙的市民们一定正在谋害科尔内留斯·德维特和约翰·德维特先生呢。”","“Faith, sir, they say—but it is not quite sure—that by this hour the burghers must be murdering Mynheer Cornelius and Mynheer John de Witt.”"
"“哦。”博克斯戴尔咕哝着，与其说是咕哝，不如说他在低声咆哮。他闭上了双眼，仿佛想象中那可怕的场景已经跃然眼前。","“Oh,” muttered, or rather growled Boxtel, closing his eyes from the dreadful picture which presented itself to his imagination."
"“嗨，想必博克斯戴尔先生病得挺重的，所以听到这好消息都没从床上跳起来。”仆人离开房间时，自言自语道。","“Why, to be sure,” said the servant to himself, whilst leaving the room, “Mynheer Isaac Boxtel must be very sick not to have jumped from his bed on hearing such good news.”"
"事实上，伊萨克·博克斯戴尔的确是病了，就像一个人杀了人一样纠结。","And, in reality, Isaac Boxtel was very sick, like a man who has murdered another."
"不过他这次杀人可是要一箭双雕。第一个目标已经实现了，第二个还没有。","But he had murdered his man with a double object; the first was attained, the second was still to be attained."
"夜幕降临了。这也正是博克斯戴尔期待的晚上。","Night closed in.It was the night which Boxtel had looked forward to."
"天一黑他就起来了。","As soon as it was dark he got up."
"他爬上了他的西克莫无花果树。","He then climbed into his sycamore."
"他算准了，没人想到要看守花园，屋子里和仆人们都乱作一团。","He had calculated correctly; no one thought of keeping watch over the garden; the house and the servants were all in the utmost confusion."
"他听到钟敲响十下，十一下，十二下。　","He heard the clock strike—ten, eleven, twelve."
"午夜，他心怦怦直跳，双手发抖，面色发青。他从树上下来，搬来一把梯子，把它靠在墙上，爬到倒数第二个梯级上，静听周围的动静。","At midnight, with a beating heart, trembling hands, and a livid countenance, he descended from the tree, took a ladder, leaned it against the wall, mounted it to the last step but one, and listened."
"周围一片寂静，没有一点儿声响打破这片沉寂。屋子里闪着一束孤寂的光亮，那是女管家的灯光。","All was perfectly quiet, not a sound broke the silence of the night; one solitary light, that of the housekeeper, was burning in the house."
"这寂静与黑暗给博克斯戴尔壮了胆。他骑在墙头，停留了片刻，确定没什么可担心的了，便把梯子从他的花园搬到科尔内留斯的花园里，爬了下来。","This silence and this darkness emboldened Boxtel; he got astride the wall, stopped for an instant, and, after having ascertained that there was nothing to fear, he put his ladder from his own garden into that of Cornelius, and descended."
"哪里种着可以开出黑郁金香的球茎，他了如指掌，于是径直朝那里奔去，但是由于担心自己留在软土上的脚印会让自己败露，他就沿着砾石小径走。一到准确位置，他就像老虎一样，迫不及待地把手伸进松软的泥土里。","Then, knowing to an inch where the bulbs which were to produce the black tulip were planted, he ran towards the spot, following, however, the gravelled walks in order not to be betrayed by his footprints, and, on arriving at the precise spot, he proceeded, with the eagerness of a tiger, to plunge his hand into the soft ground."
"他什么也没找到，怀疑是不是自己弄错了。","He found nothing, and thought he was mistaken."
"同时，他的额头沁出了冷汗。","In the meanwhile, the cold sweat stood on his brow."
"他摸了一下周围的地方——没有。","He felt about close by it,—nothing."
"他摸了摸右边，又摸了摸左边——没有。","He felt about on the right, and on the left,—nothing."
"他摸了摸前边，又摸了摸后边——还是没有。","He felt about in front and at the back,—nothing."
"当他最终确信那块地当天早上就被人动过了时，他简直快要疯了。","He was nearly mad, when at last he satisfied himself that on that very morning the earth had been disturbed."
"事实上，当博克斯戴尔还躺在床上的时候，科尔内留斯已经去花园取出了母体球茎，接着，我们前面已经看到了，他把球茎分成三个。","In fact, whilst Boxtel was lying in bed, Cornelius had gone down to his garden, had taken up the mother bulb, and, as we have seen, divided it into three."
"博克斯戴尔没法说服自己离开这个地方。他用双手挖了十多平方英尺。","Boxtel could not bring himself to leave the place.He dug up with his hands more than ten square feet of ground."
"终于，他的不幸是毋庸置疑的了。他气得抓狂，回到梯子跟前，爬上墙，收起梯子，扔到自己的花园里，跟着跳了下来。","At last no doubt remained of his misfortune.Mad with rage, he returned to his ladder, mounted the wall, drew up the ladder, flung it into his own garden, and jumped after it."
"突然，他脑子里闪出最后一线希望：刚出幼苗的球茎可能在干燥室里，要进干燥室他只需重复他爬进花园的步骤。","All at once, a last ray of hope presented itself to his mind: the seedling bulbs might be in the dry-room; it was therefore only requisite to make his entry there as he had done into the garden."
"他会在那里找到球茎的，况且，这一点儿都不困难，因为干燥室的窗子跟温室的一样，是可以提开的。科尔内留斯早上开了窗户，也没人想到要把它们关上。","There he would find them, and, moreover, it was not at all difficult, as the sashes of the dry-room might be raised like those of a greenhouse.Cornelius had opened them on that morning, and no one had thought of closing them again."
"因此，一切取决于他能否弄来一把足够长度的梯子——一把二十五英尺，而不是十英尺长的梯子。","Everything, therefore, depended upon whether he could procure a ladder of sufficient length,—one of twenty-five feet instead of ten."
"博克斯戴尔曾注意到，他住的那条街上有一家房子正在修葺，墙头就竖着一把大梯子。","Boxtel had noticed in the street where he lived a house which was being repaired, and against which a very tall ladder was placed."
"那梯子一定很合适，除非工人把它拿走了。","This ladder would do admirably, unless the workmen had taken it away."
"他跑到房子跟前，梯子在那里。博克斯戴尔拿起它，费了好大劲儿才把它搬进自己的花园，又费了更大的劲儿才把梯子竖在范巴尔莱家的墙头靠着，梯子刚好到窗户那里。","He ran to the house: the ladder was there.Boxtel took it, carried it with great exertion to his garden, and with even greater difficulty raised it against the wall of Van Baerle’s house, where it just reached to the window."
"博克斯戴尔把一盏点着了的暗灯放在口袋里，爬上梯子，溜进了干燥室。","Boxtel put a lighted dark lantern into his pocket, mounted the ladder, and slipped into the dry-room."
"一到花卉研究者的圣所，他就动不了了，两腿发软，倚着桌子才勉强站立，心跳快得好像他要窒息了。在这里可比在花园里恶劣多了，在花园他只是侵入者，擅闯他人领地，而在这里他是贼，偷别人的东西。","On reaching this sanctuary of the florist he stopped, supporting himself against the table; his legs failed him, his heart beat as if it would choke him.Here it was even worse than in the garden; there Boxtel was only a trespasser, here he was a thief."
"但是，他还是鼓足了勇气——他费尽周折，都走到这一步了，才不要空手而归呢。","However, he took courage again: he had not gone so far to turn back with empty hands."
"可是他把整个屋子都搜了一遍，还是一无所获。所有的抽屉，开了又关，都翻遍了，就连存放让科尔内留斯搭上性命的那个包裹的抽屉都没落下。如同置身于植物园，他看到贴着形形色色的标签的郁金香——“雅内”、“约翰·德维特”、“榛子色”，还有“炒咖啡豆色”的。但他却没有找到黑郁金香，更确切地说是尚处于休眠状态的黑郁金香鳞茎的一丝踪迹。","But in vain did he search the whole room, open and shut all the drawers, even that privileged one where the parcel which had been so fatal to Cornelius had been deposited; he found ticketed, as in a botanical garden, the “Jane,” the “John de Witt,” the hazel-nut, and the roasted-coffee coloured tulip; but of the black tulip, or rather the seedling bulbs within which it was still sleeping, not a trace was found."
"范巴尔莱曾把种子和球茎的记录做了一个副本，那记录估计比阿姆斯特丹的一流商号的帐都还要仔细精准，博克斯戴尔检查记录时，看到下面几行字：","And yet, on looking over the register of seeds and bulbs, which Van Baerle kept in duplicate, if possible even with greater exactitude and care than the first commercial houses of Amsterdam their ledgers, Boxtel read these lines:—"
"“今日，一六七二年八月二十日，我取出了大黑郁金香的母体球茎，并把它完好无损地分成三个球茎。”","“Today, 20th of August, 1672, I have taken up the mother bulb of the grand black tulip, which I have divided into three perfect suckers.”"
"“啊，球茎！球茎！”博克斯戴尔吼叫着，边吼边把干燥室翻了个底朝天，“他会把它们藏在哪儿呢？”","“Oh these bulbs, these bulbs!” howled Boxtel, turning over everything in the dry-room, “where could he have concealed them?”"
"接着，他忽然在狂乱中猛拍自己的脑门儿，喊道：“哎呀，我真该死！我博克斯戴尔真是个大傻瓜！难道人家会不带上他的球茎？难道他去海牙，会把他的球茎撂在多特？他的球茎就快开出大黑郁金香了，离开它们他能活吗？　他还来得及把它们带走，这个混蛋，居然把它们带在身边，他把它们带到海牙去了！”","Then, suddenly striking his forehead in his frenzy, he called out, “Oh wretch that I am!Oh thrice fool Boxtel!Would any one be separated from his bulbs?Would any one leave them at Dort, when one goes to the Hague?Could one live far from one’s bulbs, when they enclose the grand black tulip?He had time to get hold of them, the scoundrel, he has them about him, he has taken them to the Hague!”"
"这犹如一道晴天霹雳击中了博克斯戴尔，他顶风冒险干坏事居然做了无用功，他仿佛跌入无底深渊。","It was like a flash of lightning which showed to Boxtel the abyss of a uselessly committed crime."
"博克斯戴尔瘫坐在桌上，就在几个小时前，不幸的范巴尔莱还在那张桌上怡然自得地凝视着他心爱的球茎。","Boxtel sank quite paralyzed on that very table, and on that very spot where, some hours before, the unfortunate Van Baerle had so leisurely, and with such intense delight, contemplated his darling bulbs."
"满怀嫉妒的博克斯戴尔沮丧地双手掩面，然后抬起他那张乌青的脸，说：“好吧，就算他把球茎带走了，他也只能在他活着的时候留着它们，等他——”","“Well, then, after all,” said the envious Boxtel,—raising his livid face from his hands in which it had been buried—“if he has them, he can keep them only as long as he lives, and—”"
"余下的恶念他都写在他狰狞的笑容里了。","The rest of this detestable thought was expressed by a hideous smile."
"“球茎在海牙，”他说，“我也不能在多特再呆下去了，为了球茎，我要去海牙！去海牙！”","“The bulbs are at the Hague,” he said, “therefore, I can no longer live at Dort: away, then, for them, to the Hague! to the Hague!”"
"博克斯戴尔倒没顾及到自己的金银财宝，他一门心思全放在另一件无价之宝上，他钻出窗户，从梯子上滑下来，把梯子放回原处，然后像只猛兽般，咆哮着回到自己的家中。","And Boxtel, without taking any notice of the treasures about him, so entirely were his thoughts absorbed by another inestimable treasure, let himself out by the window, glided down the ladder, carried it back to the place whence he had taken it, and, like a beast of prey, returned growling to his house."
"第九章 家族的专用牢房","Chapter 9 The Family Cell"
"可怜的范巴尔莱被关进了布伊坦霍夫监狱时差不多已经半夜了。","It was about midnight when poor Van Baerle was locked up in the prison of the Buytenhof."
"罗莎预计的事情果然发生了。人们发现科尔内留斯·德维特的牢房空了，怒不可遏。要是格里弗斯这时候落入这群疯子手中，肯定得为囚犯偿命。","What Rosa foresaw had come to pass.On finding the cell of Cornelius de Witt empty, the wrath of the people ran very high, and had Gryphus fallen into the hands of those madmen he would certainly have had to pay with his life for the prisoner."
"可是这满腔怒火在两兄弟身上完全发泄出来了。幸亏一向谨小慎微的威廉事先采取了预防措施，关上了城门，这群刽子手才追上了这两兄弟。","But this fury had vented itself most fully on the two brothers when they were overtaken by the murderers, thanks to the precaution which William—the man of precautions—had taken in having the gates of the city closed."
"监狱空了，也因此恢复了短暂的平静。罗莎趁着这个好时机，从她的藏身之所爬出来，然后又劝她父亲出来。","A momentary lull had therefore set in whilst the prison was empty, and Rosa availed herself of this favourable moment to come forth from her hiding place, which she also induced her father to leave."
"这下监狱空无一人了。一场杀戮在托尔—赫克上演，人们干嘛还留在监狱呢？","The prison was therefore completely deserted.Why should people remain in the jail whilst murder was going on at the Tol-Hek?"
"格里弗斯跟在勇敢的罗莎后面，颤颤巍巍地爬出来。他们过去把大门关上，门差不多被毁了，但毕竟还能关。可想而知，那飓风般的愤怒人群把多少气都撒在那门上了。","Gryphus came forth trembling behind the courageous Rosa.They went to close the great gate, at least as well as it would close, considering that it was half demolished.It was easy to see that a hurricane of mighty fury had vented itself upon it."
"大概四点钟的样子，格里弗斯和他的女儿又听到了喧闹声，不过这对他俩没有什么危险性。人们拖进来两具尸体，把它们吊在通常执行处决的地方。","About four o’clock a return of the noise was heard, but of no threatening character to Gryphus and his daughter.The people were only dragging in the two corpses, which they came back to gibbet at the usual place of execution."
"罗莎又躲起来了，但这次只是为了回避那恐怖的场面。","Rosa hid herself this time also, but only that she might not see the ghastly spectacle."
"午夜时分，又有人敲响了监狱的大门，更确切地说，他们敲得是替代大门的障碍物。他们押来的正是科尔内留斯·范巴尔莱。","At midnight, people again knocked at the gate of the jail, or rather at the barricade which served in its stead: it was Cornelius van Baerle whom they were bringing."
"监狱看守接收了这位新囚犯，从逮捕证上看到了犯人的姓名和身份，他脸上挂着职业笑容，低声说：","When the jailer received this new inmate, and saw from the warrant the name and station of his prisoner, he muttered with his turnkey smile,—"
"“科尔内留斯·德维特的教子！哟，年轻人，我们这儿可有家族专用的牢房，我就把它给你吧。”","“Godson of Cornelius de Witt!Well, young man, we have the family cell here, and we will give it to you.”"
"这个凶暴的奥兰治派人对自己刚才说的玩笑话很得意，他拿过标灯和钥匙，把科尔内留斯带到了就在当天早上科尔内留斯·德维特才逃亡离开的牢房。革命时期，那些伟大的哲人像制定至高政策的原则一样，说：“只有死人才不会回来。”这句话正寓意着科尔内留斯·德维特的命运。","And quite enchanted with his joke, the ferocious Orangeman took his cresset and his keys to conduct Cornelius to the cell, which on that very morning Cornelius de Witt had left to go into exile, or what in revolutionary times is meant instead by those sublime philosophers who lay it down as an axiom of high policy, “It is the dead only who do not return.”"
"这个绝望的花卉爱好者，在穿过监狱去他牢房的路上，除了狗吠，他什么都没听见，除了一张年轻姑娘的脸，他什么都没看见。","On the way which the despairing florist had to traverse to reach that cell he heard nothing but the barking of a dog, and saw nothing but the face of a young girl."
"狗从壁龛里一跃而出，晃动着它的铁链，围着科尔内留斯嗅个不停，说不定哪天有人命令它扑咬他，它能认得准点儿。","The dog rushed forth from a niche in the wall, shaking his heavy chain, and sniffing all round Cornelius in order so much the better to recognise him in case he should be ordered to pounce upon him."
"囚犯上楼时，一位年轻的姑娘出现在她房间门口，那狭小的门正对着那段楼梯。她右手拿灯，同时也照亮了她花儿一样美的脸庞，一头茂密的、金色波浪长发。她用左手把她的白色睡裙裹在胸口。她已经睡了一觉了，范巴尔莱的意外到来把她从睡梦中惊醒了。","The young girl, whilst the prisoner was mounting the staircase, appeared at the narrow door of her chamber, which opened on that very flight of steps; and, holding the lamp in her right hand, she at the same time lit up her pretty blooming face, surrounded by a profusion of rich wavy golden locks, whilst with her left she held her white night-dress closely over her breast, having been roused from her first slumber by the unexpected arrival of Van Baerle."
"这真是一幅不错的画面，值得伦勃朗把它画下来：格里弗斯手中淡红色的标灯照亮了阴暗弯曲的楼道，他带着监狱看守惯有的表情，绷着脸站在上面。忧郁的科尔内留斯正弓着腰，倚着扶手往下看罗莎的甜美面孔。罗莎站在她房间门口的亮光里，因为在这样的情况下被陌生人看到而神色有些尴尬。","It would have made a fine picture, worthy of Rembrandt, the gloomy winding stairs illuminated by the reddish glare of the cresset of Gryphus, with his scowling jailer’s countenance at the top, the melancholy figure of Cornelius bending over the banister to look down upon the sweet face of Rosa, standing, as it were, in the bright frame of the door of her chamber, with embarrassed mien at being thus seen by a stranger."
"而在最底端的暗处，细节都变得模糊，只有那只大狗，双眼闪着红宝石般的光芒，晃动着它的铁链。铁链在罗莎和格里弗斯各自灯光的投映下，闪着明亮的光。","And at the bottom, quite in the shade, where the details are absorbed in the obscurity, the mastiff, with his eyes glistening like carbuncles, and shaking his chain, on which the double light from the lamp of Rosa and the lantern of Gryphus threw a brilliant glitter."
"然而，罗莎看着这个面容苍白、模样英俊的小伙子缓缓地爬着楼梯，思忖着刚刚她父亲说的“你就住你家的专用牢房吧”的全部含义。她脸上流露的悲伤恐怕连这位杰出的大师都完全没法在他的画里诠释出来。","The sublime master would, however, have been altogether unable to render the sorrow expressed in the face of Rosa, when she saw this pale, handsome young man slowly climbing the stairs, and thought of the full import of the words, which her father had just spoken, “You will have the family cell.”"
"这幅画面只持续了片刻，远没有咱们描述得这般缓慢。接着，格里弗斯继续往前走，科尔内留斯被迫跟在后面。五分钟后，他来到他的牢房，相信这个牢房已经无需赘述了，读者已经很熟悉了。","This vision lasted but a moment,—much less time than we have taken to describe it.Gryphus then proceeded on his way, Cornelius was forced to follow him, and five minutes afterwards he entered his prison, of which it is unnecessary to say more, as the reader is already acquainted with it."
"格里弗斯用手指了指一张床，殉道者科尔内留斯曾在此饱受痛苦，也就是在当天把自己的灵魂献给了上帝。然后，他拿起标灯就离开了。","Gryphus pointed with his finger to the bed on which the martyr had suffered so much, who on that day had rendered his soul to God.Then, taking up his cresset, he quitted the cell."
"科尔内留斯一人被丢在牢房里。他倒在床上，却睡不着。眼睛不停地盯着那扇装着铁栅的小窗，窗外就是布伊坦霍夫广场。凭窗眺望，他从树林后看到清晨投在地平面上第一缕曙光，如同一个白色的斗篷。","Thus left alone, Cornelius threw himself on his bed, but he slept not, he kept his eye fixed on the narrow window, barred with iron, which looked on the Buytenhof; and in this way saw from behind the trees that first pale beam of light which morning sheds on the earth as a white mantle."
"夜间，时不时有马从布伊坦霍夫广场飞奔而过，巡逻队沉重的踏步声在人行道上回荡。火绳钩枪的缓燃引信在东风中火光摇曳，不时地突然耀出一道强光，投射在监狱的窗户上。","Now and then during the night horses had galloped at a smart pace over the Buytenhof, the heavy tramp of the patrols had resounded from the pavement, and the slow matches of the arquebuses, flaring in the east wind, had thrown up at intervals a sudden glare as far as to the panes of his window."
"可是，当徐徐升起的太阳把房子的山墙顶镶上了金边时，科尔内留斯很想知道自己周围还有没有什么活物。他来到窗前，悲伤地环视着眼前圆形的广场。","But when the rising sun began to gild the coping stones at the gable ends of the houses, Cornelius, eager to know whether there was any living creature about him, approached the window, and cast a sad look round the circular yard before him."
"在广场的尽头，一团黑乎乎的、被清晨的雾霭浸成深蓝色的东西矗立在眼前。它深色的轮廓在沐浴着淡淡晨光的房屋的映衬下，显得格外引人注目。","At the end of the yard a dark mass, tinted with a dingy blue by the morning dawn, rose before him, its dark outlines standing out in contrast to the houses already illuminated by the pale light of early morning."
"科尔内留斯认出那是绞刑架。","Cornelius recognised the gibbet."
"绞刑架上面吊着两具面目全非的尸体。事实上，只是两具鲜血淋淋的骨头架。","On it were suspended two shapeless trunks, which indeed were no more than bleeding skeletons."
"善良的海牙人把受害者的肉一片片地割掉，还不折不扣地把剩余部分抬到了绞刑架，这样就可以有堂而皇之的借口在一张大布告上写下两份墓志铭。二十八岁的科尔内留斯，凭着他敏锐的视力，看到下面几行用刷招牌的粗刷子涂出的文字：","The good people of the Hague had chopped off the flesh of its victims, but faithfully carried the remainder to the gibbet, to have a pretext for a double inscription written on a huge placard, on which Cornelius; with the keen sight of a young man of twenty-eight, was able to read the following lines, daubed by the coarse brush of a sign-painter:—"
"“这里吊着一个叫约翰·德维特的大坏蛋，还有小坏蛋，他的哥哥科尔内留斯·德维特。他们都是人民的敌人，却是法国国王的好朋友。”","“Here are hanging the great rogue of the name of John de Witt, and the little rogue Cornelius de Witt, his brother, two enemies of the people, but great friends of the king of France.”"
"科尔内留斯惊恐地大叫一声，极度痛苦中，他疯了似的不停地捶门、踢门。格里弗斯听到后，拿着一大串钥匙，怒气冲冲地跑上来。","Cornelius uttered a cry of horror, and in the agony of his frantic terror knocked with his hands and feet at the door so violently and continuously, that Gryphus, with his huge bunch of keys in his hand, ran furiously up."
"监狱看守一边开门，一边骂骂咧咧地说囚犯搅了他的好梦。他格里弗斯先生可不习惯这个时候被人叫醒。","The jailer opened the door, with terrible imprecations against the prisoner who disturbed him at an hour which Master Gryphus was not accustomed to be aroused."
"“哎呀，这个新来的德维特家的人，我看真是疯了。”他嚷道，“我看德维特家的人都是邪恶的坏蛋。”","“Well, now, by my soul, he is mad, this new De Witt,” he cried, “but all those De Witts have the devil in them.”"
"“先生，先生，”科尔内留斯抓着格里弗斯的胳膊，把他拽到窗口说，“先生，您帮我看看那下面写的什么？”","“Master, master,” cried Cornelius, seizing the jailer by the arm and dragging him towards the window,—“master, what have I read down there?”"
"“哪个下面？”","“Where down there?”"
"“就是那张布告上。”","“On that placard.”"
"他浑身哆嗦、脸色苍白、气喘吁吁地指着广场尽头的绞刑架，上面写有讽刺挖苦的墓志铭。","And, trembling, pale, and gasping for breath, he pointed to the gibbet at the other side of the yard, with the cynical inscription surmounting it."
"格里弗斯顿时哈哈大笑起来。","Gryphus broke out into a laugh."
"“啊！啊！”他回答，“这么说，你都看见了。好啦，亲爱的先生，谁要和奥兰治亲王殿下的敌人通信，那就是他们的下场。”","“Eh! eh!” he answered, “so, you have read it.Well, my good sir, that’s what people will get for corresponding with the enemies of his Highness the Prince of Orange.”"
"“德维特兄弟被杀害了！”科尔内留斯咕哝着，额头冒出了冷汗，跌坐在床上，胳膊无力地垂落着，闭上了眼睛。","“The brothers De Witt are murdered!” Cornelius muttered, with the cold sweat on his brow, and sank on his bed, his arms hanging by his side, and his eyes closed."
"“德维特兄弟俩可是受到了人民的审判，”格里弗斯说，“你居然说是杀害，不是吗？要我说，那是伏法。”","“The brothers De Witt have been judged by the people,” said Gryphus; “you call that murdered, do you? well, I call it executed.”"
"他看到犯人不仅安静下来了，还倒在床上，不省人事的样子，就赶紧走出牢房，使劲地带上门，丁零当啷地把门锁上了。","And seeing that the prisoner was not only quiet, but entirely prostrate and senseless, he rushed from the cell, violently slamming the door, and noisily drawing the bolts."
"科尔内留斯恢复知觉后，发现只剩下自己一个人。他这才意认识到他所在的牢房为什么被格里弗斯称为“家族专用的牢房”。这个牢房是通往屈辱死亡的灾难之路。","Recovering his consciousness, Cornelius found himself alone, and recognised the room where he was,—“the family cell,” as Gryphus had called it,—as the fatal passage leading to ignominious death."
"科尔内留斯是个哲人。不仅如此，他还是一个基督徒。因此，他开始为他教父的灵魂祷告，接着又替议长的灵魂祈祷，最后他顺从地将自己交给上帝，听任上帝判定的一切苦难。","And as he was a philosopher, and, more than that, as he was a Christian, he began to pray for the soul of his godfather, then for that of the Grand Pensionary, and at last submitted with resignation to all the sufferings which God might ordain for him."
"接着，他又开始关心起尘世间的事来。当他确信只有他一人在地牢后，他从怀里掏出那三个黑郁金香的球茎。在牢房最黑暗的角落里选了一块石头，把它们藏在后面，那上面按惯例还放着监狱的水壶。","Then turning again to the concerns of earth, and having satisfied himself that he was alone in his dungeon, he drew from his breast the three bulbs of the black tulip, and concealed them behind a block of stone, on which the traditional water-jug of the prison was standing, in the darkest corner of his cell."
"可惜了这么多年的努力！如此美好的梦想破灭了。他的发现终究还是化为泡影，如同他自己的生涯突然停止了一样。在这里，他所在的监狱里，没有草木的生气，没有一粒土壤，也没有一缕阳光。","Useless labour of so many years! such sweet hopes crushed; his discovery was, after all, to lead to naught, just as his own career was to be cut short.Here, in his prison, there was not a trace of vegetation, not an atom of soil, not a ray of sunshine."
"想到此，科尔内留斯陷入无限的绝望中。此时，一件非同寻常的事情发生了，他才振作起来。","At this thought Cornelius fell into a gloomy despair, from which he was only aroused by an extraordinary circumstance."
"发生什么事了呢？","What was this circumstance?"
"我们下一章再跟读者们娓娓道来吧。","We shall inform the reader in our next chapter."
"第十章 监狱看守的女儿","Chapter 10 The Jailer’s Daughter"
"就在那天晚上，格里弗斯给犯人送饭，可石板太潮，开牢门时他不小心滑了一下。摔倒的时候本想用手撑住，结果糟糕的事情发生了，他腕关节以上的胳膊折了。","On the same evening Gryphus, as he brought the prisoner his mess, slipped on the damp flags whilst opening the door of the cell, and fell, in the attempt to steady himself, on his hand; but as it was turned the wrong way, he broke his arm just above the wrist."
"科尔内留斯赶紧冲过去，看能不能帮上忙，但格里弗斯没有意识到自己伤势的严重性，他大声喊道：","Cornelius rushed forward towards the jailer, but Gryphus, who was not yet aware of the serious nature of his injury, called out to him,—"
"“我没事，你别动！”","“It is nothing: don’t you stir.”"
"他试着用胳膊支撑着自己站起来，但是骨头断了，那时候他才感到疼，大叫了一声。","He then tried to support himself on his arm, but the bone gave way; then only he felt the pain, and uttered a cry."
"待他意识到自己的胳膊断了，这个对人刻薄的家伙已经昏厥在门口，一动也不动，浑身冰凉，就跟死了一样。","When he became aware that his arm was broken, this man, so harsh to others, fell swooning on the threshold, where he remained motionless and cold, as if dead."
"这期间，牢门一直开着，科尔内留斯觉得自己几乎自由了。但是他想都没想利用这个时机逃走。他知道，从胳膊弯曲的方式以及弯曲时发出的声音来看，骨头断裂了，病人现在一定非常痛苦。他唯一考虑的就是如何救助这位受伤者，尽管这位受伤者在他们短暂的交谈中对他并不怎么和善。","During all this time the door of the cell stood open and Cornelius found himself almost free.But the thought never entered his mind of profiting by this accident; he had seen from the manner in which the arm was bent, and from the noise it made in bending, that the bone was fractured, and that the patient must be in great pain; and now he thought of nothing else but of administering relief to the sufferer, however little benevolent the man had shown himself during their short interview."
"格里弗斯刚摔倒，在那里忍不住地叫疼，楼道就传来一阵急促的脚步声，很快，一个美丽的身影出现在科尔内留斯眼前。","At the noise of Gryphus’s fall, and at the cry which escaped him, a hasty step was heard on the staircase, and immediately after a lovely apparition presented itself to the eyes of Cornelius."
"她就是年轻貌美的弗里斯兰姑娘罗莎，看到自己的父亲躺在地上，犯人又俯身凑在跟前，她轻轻地叫了一声，因为惊恐的她起初还以为是自己的父亲太凶暴——这点她很了解——结果和犯人打起来了呢。","It was the beautiful young Frisian, who, seeing her father stretched on the ground, and the prisoner bending over him, uttered a faint cry, as in the first fright she thought Gryphus, whose brutality she well knew, had fallen in consequence of a struggle between him and the prisoner."
"她的心里开始这样怀疑的那一瞬间，科尔内留斯就知道了这姑娘在想什么。","Cornelius understood what was passing in the mind of the girl, at the very moment when the suspicion arose in her heart."
"但她很快就明白了实情，并为自己最初的想法感到羞愧。她抬起那双美丽的、噙着泪花的眼睛，望着这位年轻人，对他说：","But one moment told her the true state of the case and, ashamed of her first thoughts, she cast her beautiful eyes, wet with tears, on the young man, and said to him,—"
"“我请求你的原谅，而且谢谢你，先生。请原谅我刚才的想法，也谢谢你给予的帮助。”","“I beg your pardon, and thank you, sir; the first for what I have thought, and the second for what you are doing.”"
"科尔内留斯脸红了，说：“我帮助我的邻居，这只是做了一个基督徒分内的事情。”","Cornelius blushed, and said, “I am but doing my duty as a Christian in helping my neighbour.”"
"“是啊，你晚上帮助他，可你忘了他早上还骂了你。啊，先生！这可不是一般的仁慈，这其实是基督徒的宽厚。”","“Yes, and affording him your help this evening, you have forgotten the abuse which he heaped on you this morning.Oh, sir! this is more than humanity,—this is indeed Christian charity.”"
"科尔内留斯审视着眼前这位漂亮的姑娘，惊讶于这样一个出身卑微的人能说出如此高尚细腻的话。","Cornelius cast his eyes on the beautiful girl, quite astonished to hear from the mouth of one so humble such a noble and feeling speech."
"可他来不及表达自己的惊讶。格里弗斯从昏迷中醒了过来，睁开了双眼，粗暴的性情也随着知觉恢复过来，他恶狠狠地说道：“现在这世道，你匆匆忙忙给囚犯送饭，不小心摔倒了还断了胳膊，人家可就愣是把你撂在地上不管。”","But he had no time to express his surprise.Gryphus recovered from his swoon, opened his eyes, and as his brutality was returning with his senses, he growled “That’s it, a fellow is in a hurry to bring to a prisoner his supper, and falls and breaks his arm, and is left lying on the ground.”"
"“别说了，爸爸，”罗莎说，“你这么说可对这位先生不公平了，我可是看着人家在努力救你啊。”","“Hush, my father,” said Rosa, “you are unjust to this gentleman, whom I found endeavouring to give you his aid.”"
"“他救我？”格里弗斯满脸狐疑地说。","“His aid?” Gryphus replied, with a doubtful air."
"“的确是的，先生！我还想多帮你做点什么呢。”","“It is quite true, master!I am quite ready to help you still more.”"
"“你？你是医生吗？”格里弗斯说。","“You!” said Gryphus, “are you a medical man?”"
"“我以前是。”","“It was formerly my profession.”"
"“这么说，你能接好我的胳膊了？”","“And so you would be able to set my arm?”"
"“完全可以。”","“Perfectly.”"
"“那需要些什么东西呢？说给我们听听。”","“And what would you need to do it? let us hear.”"
"“两片碎木头，还有缠绷带用的纱布。”","“Two splinters of wood, and some linen for a bandage.”"
"“罗莎，听见没？”格里弗斯说，“犯人要帮我接胳膊，这可省了不少钱，扶我站起来，我怎么觉得身子沉得跟铅一样。”","“Do you hear, Rosa?” said Gryphus, “the prisoner is going to set my arm, that’s a saving; come, assist me to get up, I feel as heavy as lead.”"
"罗莎把肩膀凑过去，他用那只好胳膊环着姑娘的脖子，借着一股子劲儿努力站了起来，科尔内留斯为了避免他移动，朝他拉过来一把椅子。","Rosa lent the sufferer her shoulder; he put his unhurt arm around her neck, and making an effort, got on his legs, whilst Cornelius, to save him a walk, pushed a chair towards him."
"格里弗斯坐定后，转头对他女儿说：　","Gryphus sat down; then, turning towards his daughter, he said,—"
"“怎么，你没听见吗？快去把他需要的东西拿来。”","“Well, didn’t you hear? go and fetch what is wanted.”"
"罗莎下了楼，很快就拿着小桶上的两块桶板和一大卷亚麻绷带回来了。","Rosa went down, and immediately after returned with two staves of a small barrel and a large roll of linen bandage."
"科尔内留斯趁这个空把格里弗斯的外套脱了，又挽起了他衬衣的袖子。","Cornelius had made use of the intervening moments to take off the man’s coat, and to tuck up his shirt sleeve."
"“这就是您要的吧，先生？”罗莎问。","“Is this what you require, sir?” asked Rosa."
"“是的，小姐。”科尔内留斯瞧了瞧她拿的东西，说，“是的，没错儿。现在，我托着你爸爸的胳膊，你把这张桌子推过来。”","“Yes, mademoiselle,” answered Cornelius, looking at the things she had brought,—“yes, that’s right.Now push this table, whilst I support the arm of your father.”"
"罗莎推来桌子，科尔内留斯把断掉的胳膊平放在上面，娴熟地接好了胳膊，调整了一下夹板，系紧了绷带。","Rosa pushed the table, Cornelius placed the broken arm on it so as to make it flat, and with perfect skill set the bone, adjusted the splinters, and fastened the bandages."
"但在最后固定的时候，监狱看守又一次疼昏过去了。","At the last touch, the jailer fainted a second time."
"“快去拿醋来，小姐，”科尔内留斯说，“我们用醋擦他的太阳穴，他就会醒过来的。”","“Go and fetch vinegar, mademoiselle,” said Cornelius; “we will bathe his temples, and he will recover.”"
"可是，罗莎并未按照医生的吩咐去做，当她确信她的父亲仍在昏迷后，她走近科尔内留斯，说：","But, instead of acting up to the doctor’s prescription, Rosa, after having satisfied herself that her father was still unconscious, approached Cornelius and said,—"
"“一报还一报，先生。”","“Service for service, sir.”"
"“你这是什么意思，美丽的姑娘？”科尔内留斯说。","“What do you mean, my pretty child?” said Cornelius."
"“先生，我的意思是，明天要审查你的法官今天询问你被关在哪个牢房，当他得知你在科尔内留斯·德维特先生曾经呆过的牢房里时，很阴险地笑了一下，所以我担心您凶多吉少啊。”","“I mean to say, sir, that the judge who is to examine you to-morrow has inquired to-day for the room in which you are confined, and, on being told that you are occupying the cell of Mynheer Cornelius de Witt, laughed in a very strange and very disagreeable manner, which makes me fear that no good awaits you.”"
"“可是，他们能怎么害我呢？”科尔内留斯问。","“But,” asked Cornelius, “what harm can they do to me?”"
"“您看看那绞刑架。”","“Look at that gibbet.”"
"“可是我没罪啊。”科尔内留斯说。","“But I am not guilty,” said Cornelius."
"“那您看看吊在那儿，被千刀万剐、面目全非的他们，他们有罪吗？”","“Were they guilty whom you see down there gibbeted, mangled, and torn to pieces?”"
"“这倒也是。”科尔内留斯神情凝重地说。","“That’s true,” said Cornelius, gravely."
"“而且，欲加之罪，何患无辞。”罗莎继续说道。“不管你有罪与否，你的审判明天就开始，后天你就会被定罪。眼下这兵荒马乱的日子里，事情处理起来快着呢。”","“And besides,” continued Rosa, “the people want to find you guilty.But whether innocent or guilty, your trial begins to-morrow, and the day after you will be condemned.Matters are settled very quickly in these times.”"
"“那你说了这么多，你的意思是？”","“Well, and what do you conclude from all this?”"
"“我的意思是，我身单力薄，我爸爸又昏迷着躺在地上，狗也被戴了口套，因此，没有什么可以阻止你逃走了。逃吧，这就是我的意思。”","“I conclude that I am alone, that I am weak, that my father is lying in a swoon, that the dog is muzzled, and that consequently there is nothing to prevent your making your escape.Fly, then; that’s what I mean.”"
"“你说什么？”","“What do you say?”"
"“我说我没能救得了科尔内留斯·德维特先生和约翰·德维特先生，我想救你。不过要快，瞧，我爸爸已经缓过气来，再过一分钟，他就会睁开眼，那时候就迟了。你还在犹豫什么？”","“I say that I was not able to save Mynheer Cornelius or Mynheer John de Witt, and that I should like to save you.Only be quick; there, my father is regaining his breath, one minute more, and he will open his eyes, and it will be too late.Do you hesitate?”"
"其实科尔内留斯看着罗莎，一动也不动，仿佛是虽然看着她，但没听到她说话似的。","In fact, Cornelius stood immovable, looking at Rosa, yet looking at her as if he did not hear her."
"“你没听明白吗？”年轻的姑娘不耐烦地说。","“Don’t you understand me?” said the young girl, with some impatience."
"“不，我明白，”科尔内留斯说，“可是——”","“Yes, I do,” said Cornelius, “but—”"
"“可是什么？”","“But?”"
"“我不会逃的，他们会归罪于你的。”","“I will not, they would accuse you.”"
"“那又怎样，”罗莎说着脸红了，“别管那么多了。”","“Never mind,” said Rosa, blushing, “never mind that.”"
"“亲爱的孩子，你很善良，”科尔内留斯说，“但我还是留下来。”","“You are very good, my dear child,” replied Cornelius, “but I stay.”"
"“你留下？啊，先生！先生啊！你难道不明白吗？你会被处以死刑，上断头台，可能还会像约翰和科尔内留斯先生一样，被杀害后，还会被千刀万剐。看在上帝的份上，别顾及我了，从这儿逃走吧。你得当心，这儿给德维特兄弟带来了厄运！”","“You stay, oh, sir! oh, sir! don’t you understand that you will be condemned to death, executed on the scaffold, perhaps assassinated and torn to pieces, just like Mynheer John and Mynheer Cornelius.For heaven’s sake, don’t think of me, but fly from this place, Take care, it bears ill luck to the De Witts!”"
"“喂！”监狱看守恢复知觉后，大叫一声，“谁又在提德维特那两个流氓、恶棍、坏蛋？”","“Halloa!” cried the jailer, recovering his senses, “who is talking of those rogues, those wretches, those villains, the De Witts?”"
"“别生气，好人。”科尔内留斯和蔼地笑着，“骨折最忌讳的就是情绪激动了，情绪一激动，血液就会沸腾。”","“Don’t be angry, my good man,” said Cornelius, with his good-tempered smile, “the worst thing for a fracture is excitement, by which the blood is heated.”"
"于是，他小声对罗莎说：","Thereupon, he said in an undertone to Rosa—"
"“我的孩子，我是清白的，我会平静从容地等待我的审判。”","“My child, I am innocent, and I shall await my trial with tranquillity and an easy mind.”"
"“嘘。”罗莎说。","“Hush,” said Rosa."
"“怎么了？”","“Why hush?”"
"“可不能让我爸爸认为我们俩说过话。”","“My father must not suppose that we have been talking to each other.”"
"“那有什么不好？”","“What harm would that do?”"
"“什么不好？他会从此以后都不让我来这儿了。”罗莎说。","“What harm?He would never allow me to come here any more,” said Rosa."
"科尔内留斯听到这句天真的知心话，微微一笑，他仿佛觉得在他的道路上闪耀着幸福的光辉。","Cornelius received this innocent confidence with a smile; he felt as if a ray of good fortune were shining on his path."
"“喂，那你们现在在那儿叽叽喳喳说什么？”格里弗斯说着，他用左臂托着自己的右臂站起来。","“Now, then, what are you chattering there together about?” said Gryphus, rising and supporting his right arm with his left."
"“没什么，”罗莎说，“医生跟我说你的饮食得注意些什么。”","“Nothing,” said Rosa; “the doctor is explaining to me what diet you are to keep.”"
"“我还得注意饮食？我的好丫头，我看你也得注意。”","“Diet, diet for me?Well, my fine girl, I shall put you on diet too.”"
"“注意什么，爸爸？”","“On what diet, my father?”"
"“不要去犯人的牢房，就算去了，也得尽快离开。”跟我走吧，你引路，快点。”","“Never to go to the cells of the prisoners, and, if ever you should happen to go, to leave them as soon as possible.Come, off with me, lead the way, and be quick.”"
"罗莎和科尔内留斯互相使眼色。","Rosa and Cornelius exchanged glances."
"罗莎想说：","That of Rosa tried to express,—"
"“这不，你瞧？”","“There, you see?”"
"科尔内留斯想说的是：","That of Cornelius said,—"
"“顺其自然吧。”","“Let it be as the Lord wills.”"
"第十一章 科尔内留斯·范巴尔莱的遗愿","Chapter 11 Cornelius van Baerle’s Will"
"罗莎说得没错，法官第二天就来到了布伊坦霍夫，并对科尔内留斯·范巴尔莱进行了审判。不过，讯问的时间并不长，科尔内留斯家里藏有德维特兄弟与法国的重要信件，证据确凿。","Rosa had not been mistaken; the judges came on the following day to the Buytenhof, and proceeded with the trial of Cornelius van Baerle.The examination, however, did not last long, it having appeared on evidence that Cornelius had kept at his house that fatal correspondence of the brothers De Witt with France."
"科尔内留斯对此也没否认。","He did not deny it."
"唯一需要确定的是，这些信件是不是由他的教父，科尔内留斯·德维特亲自托付给他的。","The only point about which there seemed any difficulty was whether this correspondence had been intrusted to him by his godfather, Cornelius de Witt."
"可是，既然这两位殉道者已经死了，范巴尔莱也没理由再有所保留了，他不仅没有否认包裹是由科尔内留斯·德维特本人交给他的，连在什么情况下交给他的都一五一十地说了。","But as, since the death of those two martyrs, Van Baerle had no longer any reason for withholding the truth, he not only did not deny that the parcel had been delivered to him by Cornelius de Witt himself, but he also stated all the circumstances under which it was done."
"他这一承认，就表明科尔内留斯·德维特和科尔内留斯·范巴尔莱是合谋，结果教子也被牵扯到他教父的案子中去了。","This confession involved the godson in the crime of the godfather; manifest complicity being considered to exist between Cornelius de Witt and Cornelius van Baerle."
"诚实的科尔内留斯不只公开承认了这点，他把他的个人喜好、生活习惯以及日常生活都和盘托出。他讲述着他对政治的漠不关心，对科学研究、艺术和花卉的热爱。他解释说，自科尔内留斯·德维特在多特把包裹交给他的那天起，他就再没碰过，甚至连注意都没注意过。","The honest doctor did not confine himself to this avowal, but told the whole truth with regard to his own tastes, habits, and daily life.He described his indifference to politics, his love of study, of the fine arts, of science, and of flowers.He explained that, since the day when Cornelius de Witt handed to him the parcel at Dort, he himself had never touched, nor even noticed it."
"他这么说立刻遭到了反对，认为就这点来看，他说的不可能是事实，因为信件就存放在他每天都能看到、能摸到的柜子里。","To this it was objected, that in this respect he could not possibly be speaking the truth, since the papers had been deposited in a press in which both his hands and his eyes must have been engaged every day."
"科尔内留斯辩解道，事实的确如此，可是他每天把手伸进柜子只是为了确定他的球茎是否干燥，打开柜子看也只是为了确定球茎有没有开始发芽。","Cornelius answered that it was indeed so; that, however, he never put his hand into the press but to ascertain whether his bulbs were dry, and that he never looked into it but to see if they were beginning to sprout."
"又有人开始反对，说他是假装不关心这包东西，他对这包东西的漠然是没有理由的，因为他从他教父那里接过这包信件时，不可能不清楚这包东西的重要性。","To this again it was objected, that his pretended indifference respecting this deposit was not to be reasonably entertained, as he could not have received such papers from the hand of his godfather without being made acquainted with their important character."
"他答复说，他的教父非常爱他，尤其是，他教父是一个非常体谅的人，所以这包东西是什么，他一点都没有向他透露，因为他很清楚，说了只会让保管它的人徒增烦恼。","He replied that his godfather Cornelius loved him too well, and, above all, that he was too considerate a man to have communicated to him anything of the contents of the parcel, well knowing that such a confidence would only have caused anxiety to him who received it."
"他又遭到反驳，德维特如果真想这么做的话，他就应该在包裹上附上一纸文书，证明他的教子对这些信件毫不知情，以防万一，或者至少会在自己受审期间给他的教子写封信，这样才有证据证明他的教子不知情啊。","To this it was objected that, if De Witt had wished to act in such a way, he would have added to the parcel, in case of accidents, a certificate setting forth that his godson was an entire stranger to the nature of this correspondence, or at least he would during his trial have written a letter to him, which might be produced as his justification."
"科尔内留斯回答说，他的教父一定没想到东西存放在他那里会有什么危险，藏东西的柜子就如同是范巴尔莱全家的神龛，神圣不容侵犯，所以他的教父认为没有必要专门写份声明。提到信，他倒是想起在他被捕前，当他沉醉地凝视着他那绝无仅有的球茎时，约翰·德维特的仆人曾闯进他的干燥室，交给他一张纸条，但这些记忆如梦境一般模糊不清。仆人已经不见了踪影，而那张纸条，如果仔细找或许还能找着。","Cornelius replied that undoubtedly his godfather could not have thought that there was any risk for the safety of his deposit, hidden as it was in a press which was looked upon as sacred as the tabernacle by the whole household of Van Baerle; and that consequently he had considered the certificate as useless.As to a letter, he certainly had some remembrance that some moments previous to his arrest, whilst he was absorbed in the contemplation of one of the rarest of his bulbs, John de Witt’s servant entered his dry-room, and handed to him a paper, but the whole was to him only like a vague dream; the servant had disappeared, and as to the paper, perhaps it might be found if a proper search were made."
"至于克莱克，是不可能找到了，因为他已经离开了荷兰。","As far as Craeke was concerned, it was impossible to find him, as he had left Holland."
"找到纸条的可能性也很小，也没有谁愿意花力气去找。","The paper also was not very likely to be found, and no one gave himself the trouble to look for it."
"科尔内留斯自己在这点上也没有坚持，他甚至想，即便找到了纸条，纸条也不会和构成罪名成立的信件有任何直接联系。","Cornelius himself did not much press this point, since, even supposing that the paper should turn up, it could not have any direct connection with the correspondence which constituted the crime."
"法官们希望以此作秀，好像是他们在催促科尔内留斯更好地为自己辩护一样，这样就可以表现他们的宅心仁厚了。要知道这种耐心通常只有法官对犯人感兴趣，抑或是某人明显占对手上风，而且无需再用卑劣残暴的手段就能将对手置于死地的时候才表现出来的。","The judges wished to make it appear as though they wanted to urge Cornelius to make a better defence; they displayed that benevolent patience which is generally a sign of the magistrate’s being interested for the prisoner, or of a man’s having so completely got the better of his adversary that he needs no longer any oppressive means to ruin him."
"科尔内留斯没有接受这种虚伪的保护，他在最后的辩答中以一个殉道者的高尚气概和一个正直的人的从容镇定娓娓道来：","Cornelius did not accept of this hypocritical protection, and in a last answer, which he set forth with the noble bearing of a martyr and the calm serenity of a righteous man, he said,—"
"“先生们，你们问我的这些问题，我能回答的都是千真万确的事实。请听我说。那包东西如我刚才所描述的那样交到我手里。我在上帝面前发誓，我当时，直到现在都不清楚里面的内容。我也是在被捕时才知道我保管的是议长和德卢瓦侯爵的信函。最后，我要声辩的是，我不明白别人是怎么知道这包东西在我家的。我尤其不明白的是，我不过收下了我那德高望重却惨遭不幸的教父带到我家的东西，怎么就会被认定有罪了呢。”","“You ask me things, gentlemen, to which I can answer only the exact truth.Hear it.The parcel was put into my hands in the way I have described; I vow before God that I was, and am still, ignorant of its contents, and that it was not until my arrest that I learned that this deposit was the correspondence of the Grand Pensionary with the Marquis de Louvois.And lastly, I vow and protest that I do not understand how any one should have known that this parcel was in my house; and, above all, how I can be deemed criminal for having received what my illustrious and unfortunate godfather brought to my house.”"
"这就是范巴尔莱的全部辩护。之后，法官就最后判决开始讨论。","This was Van Baerle’s whole defence; after which the judges began to deliberate on the verdict."
"他们认为任何民众纷争的产物都是有害的，因为它会挑起斗争，而平息斗争是每个人的利益所在。","They considered that every offshoot of civil discord is mischievous, because it revives the contest which it is the interest of all to put down."
"其中一人是号称见解深刻的观察家，他表明了自己的观点：这个年轻人外表冷漠镇静，实际上一定是个非常危险的家伙，因为在他冰冷的外表之下，一定隐藏着为他的朋友——德维特兄弟复仇的欲望之火。","One of them, who bore the character of a profound observer, laid down as his opinion that this young man, so phlegmatic in appearance, must in reality be very dangerous, as under this icy exterior he was sure to conceal an ardent desire to avenge his friends, the De Witts."
"另外一个说，对郁金香的热爱与对政治的热忱不谋而合，而且历史上也有证明，很多危险人物都像从事自己的职业一样热爱园艺，尽管他们真正关心的是截然不同的东西。老塔克文不是在嘉比种罂粟的时候，策划重返罗马的吗？还有大孔代，在万森纳堡的地牢里浇灌康乃馨的时候还计划着怎样越狱呢。","Another observed that the love of tulips agreed perfectly well with that of politics, and that it was proved in history that many very dangerous men were engaged in gardening, just as if it had been their profession, whilst really they occupied themselves with perfectly different concerns; witness Tarquin the Elder, who grew poppies at Gabii, and the Great Conde, who watered his carnations at the dungeon of Vincennes at the very moment when the former meditated his return to Rome, and the latter his escape from prison."
"法官用如下二难推理作了总结：","The judge summed up with the following dilemma:—"
"“科尔内留斯·范巴尔莱或许热爱郁金香，或许热衷于政治，不管何种情形，他都说了假话。首先，在他家找到的信件就可以证明他从事了政治；其次，那些球茎可以证明他潜心于郁金香，这点是毋庸置疑的。这正是案情的严重性之所在。科尔内留斯·范巴尔莱可以在培植郁金香的同时从事政治，说明该犯具有多重性格，是个两面性的人，能以同样的热忱投入政治和郁金香，证明该犯也是危害社会稳定的一分子，并且说明他的性格和刚刚列举的老塔克文和大孔戴这些大名鼎鼎的人物性格有部分相似之处，甚至完全一样。”","“Either Cornelius van Baerle is a great lover of tulips, or a great lover of politics; in either case, he has told us a falsehood; first, because his having occupied himself with politics is proved by the letters which were found at his house; and secondly, because his having occupied himself with tulips is proved by the bulbs which leave no doubt of the fact.And herein lies the enormity of the case.As Cornelius van Baerle was concerned in the growing of tulips and in the pursuit of politics at one and the same time, the prisoner is of hybrid character, of an amphibious organisation, working with equal ardour at politics and at tulips, which proves him to belong to the class of men most dangerous to public tranquillity, and shows a certain, or rather a complete, analogy between his character and that of those master minds of which Tarquin the Elder and the Great Conde have been felicitously quoted as examples.”"
"所有这些推断的结果是，如果海牙的法官们摧毁了危害奥兰治亲王政权的阴谋，哪怕是处于萌芽状态的阴谋，这都便利了他对七省联邦的统治，荷兰总督奥兰治亲王殿下会对他们万分感激的。","The upshot of all these reasonings was, that his Highness the Prince Stadtholder of Holland would feel infinitely obliged to the magistracy of the Hague if they simplified for him the government of the Seven Provinces by destroying even the least germ of conspiracy against his authority."
"这一理由胜过其他一切理由，并且为了更有效地将阴谋扼杀在摇篮之中，这些法官们不约而同地判科尔内留斯·范巴尔莱死刑，毕竟科尔内留斯被传讯而且证明有罪，认为他表面上是郁金香爱好者，事实上他参与了德维特兄弟出卖荷兰，并与敌国法国秘密往来的无耻勾当。","This argument capped all the others, and, in order so much the more effectually to destroy the germ of conspiracy, sentence of death was unanimously pronounced against Cornelius van Baerle, as being arraigned, and convicted, for having, under the innocent appearance of a tulip-fancier, participated in the detestable intrigues and abominable plots of the brothers De Witt against Dutch nationality and in their secret relations with their French enemy."
"该判决还附加了一个补充条款，大意是“上述犯人科尔内留斯·范巴尔莱应从布伊坦霍夫监狱押赴布伊坦霍夫广场的断头台，由行刑人砍头”。","A supplementary clause was tacked to the sentence, to the effect that “the aforesaid Cornelius van Baerle should be led from the prison of the Buytenhof to the scaffold in the yard of the same name, where the public executioner would cut off his head.”"
"这次讨论非常严肃认真，所以足足持续了半个小时。其间，犯人已经被押回了牢房。","As this deliberation was a most serious affair, it lasted a full half-hour, during which the prisoner was remanded to his cell."
"书记官前来牢房向科尔内留斯宣读判词。","There the Recorder of the States came to read the sentence to him."
"格里弗斯由于胳膊骨折引起高烧，卧床不起。他的钥匙由他的一个助手看管。助手领着书记官来到了牢房，美丽的弗里斯兰姑娘罗莎借机溜进了门口的角落里，拿手绢捂着嘴，免得让人听到她的啜泣声。","Master Gryphus was detained in bed by the fever caused by the fracture of his arm.His keys passed into the hands of one of his assistants.Behind this turnkey, who introduced the Recorder, Rosa, the fair Frisian maid, had slipped into the recess of the door, with a handkerchief to her mouth to stifle her sobs."
"科尔内留斯听着判决，脸上没有忧伤，而是一种诧异。","Cornelius listened to the sentence with an expression rather of surprise than sadness."
"书记官宣读完判决后，问他还有什么话要说。","After the sentence was read, the Recorder asked him whether he had anything to answer."
"“我其实没什么话要说。”他答道，“不过我得承认，一个人谨小慎微，唯恐自己作奸犯科，结果还是死罪难逃，我怎么也没想到那也会成为构成死罪的原因之一。”","“Indeed, I have not,” he replied.“Only I confess that, among all the causes of death against which a cautious man may guard, I should never have supposed this to be comprised.”"
"书记官听他这么一说，向范巴尔莱行了一个礼。他敬礼完全是出于像他这样的公职人员，对各类要犯通常情况下都应表示出应有的尊重。","On this answer, the Recorder saluted Van Baerle with all that consideration which such functionaries generally bestow upon great criminals of every sort."
"但正当他要离开时，科尔内留斯问：“书记官先生，顺便问一下，这事定在哪一天？您明白我指什么吧？”","But whilst he was about to withdraw, Cornelius asked, “By the bye, Mr. Recorder, what day is the thing—you know what I mean—to take place?”"
"“呃，就今天。”书记官回答说，这个即将上断头台的人还如此泰然自若，着实有些让他吃惊。","“Why, to-day,” answered the Recorder, a little surprised by the self-possession of the condemned man."
"门后传来了啜泣声，科尔内留斯寻声望去，但罗莎早料到他会如此，闪到后面去了。","A sob was heard behind the door, and Cornelius turned round to look from whom it came; but Rosa, who had foreseen this movement, had fallen back."
"“还有，”科尔内留斯继续问，“那定在什么时候呢？”","“And,” continued Cornelius, “what hour is appointed?”"
"“中午十二点，先生。”","“Twelve o’clock, sir.”"
"“哦，”科尔内留斯说，“大约二十分钟前，我想我听到钟敲十点，这么说留给我的时间不多了。”","“Indeed,” said Cornelius, “I think I heard the clock strike ten about twenty minutes ago; I have not much time to spare.”"
"“是的，如果你想求得心灵的安宁，”书记官说着，深深地鞠了一躬，都快碰到地了，“你想请哪位神父都行。”","“Indeed you have not, if you wish to make your peace with God,” said the Recorder, bowing to the ground.“You may ask for any clergyman you please.”"
"说着书记官退出了牢房，助手刚要锁上牢门，跟着离开的时候，一只白皙的胳膊颤抖着拦在看守和沉重的牢门之间。","Saying these words he went out backwards, and the assistant turnkey was going to follow him, and to lock the door of Cornelius’s cell, when a white and trembling arm interposed between him and the heavy door."
"科尔内留斯就看见一顶镶着花边、金色织锦的帽子，就是弗里斯兰姑娘常戴的那种。他只听见有人在跟看守窃窃私语。看守把一串沉甸甸的钥匙交给那只伸在他面前讨要钥匙的白皙的手里，下了几级台阶，坐在楼梯半道上，这样上面就由他看守，下面就由狗看管了。戴金色帽子的人转过身来，科尔内留斯这才瞥见罗莎的脸，苍白而忧伤，美丽的眼睛泪流成河。","Cornelius saw nothing but the golden brocade cap, tipped with lace, such as the Frisian girls wore; he heard nothing but some one whispering into the ear of the turnkey.But the latter put his heavy keys into the white hand which was stretched out to receive them, and, descending some steps, sat down on the staircase which was thus guarded above by himself, and below by the dog.The head-dress turned round, and Cornelius beheld the face of Rosa, blanched with grief, and her beautiful eyes streaming with tears."
"她抱着双臂，胸脯起伏，走到科尔内留斯跟前。","She went up to Cornelius, crossing her arms on her heaving breast."
"“啊，先生！先生！”她说，可是已经泣不成声了。","“Oh, sir, sir!” she said, but sobs choked her utterance."
"“我的好姑娘，”科尔内留斯动情地说，“你想要什么？我可以告诉你，我在这个世上的时日不多了。”","“My good girl,” Cornelius replied with emotion, “what do you wish?I may tell you that my time on earth is short.”"
"“我来是想求您一件事。”罗莎说着，张开双臂，半对着科尔内留斯，半对着苍天。","“I come to ask a favour of you,” said Rosa, extending her arms partly towards him and partly towards heaven."
"“别哭得这么伤心，罗莎，”犯人说，“要知道，你哭得梨花带雨，比我那将死的命运更让我心痛。你也知道，一个犯人越无辜，他就越应该死得泰然，甚至是快乐地死，因为他是一个殉道者。好了，乖孩子，别哭了，告诉我你想要什么，美丽的罗莎。”","“Don’t weep so, Rosa,” said the prisoner, “for your tears go much more to my heart than my approaching fate, and you know, the less guilty a prisoner is, the more it is his duty to die calmly, and even joyfully, as he dies a martyr.Come, there’s a dear, don’t cry any more, and tell me what you want, my pretty Rosa.”"
"她跪了下来。“请原谅我父亲。”她说。","She fell on her knees.“Forgive my father,” she said."
"“原谅你父亲？”科尔内留斯惊讶地说。","“Your father, your father!” said Cornelius, astonished."
"“是的，他对你那么刻薄，但这是他的本性，他对每个人都是如此，被他欺负的也不止你一个。”","“Yes, he has been so harsh to you; but it is his nature, he is so to every one, and you are not the only one whom he has bullied.”"
"“他已经受到惩罚了，亲爱的罗莎，他遭遇的不测就是惩罚，甚至可以说惩罚得过头了，我原谅他。”","“He is punished, my dear Rosa, more than punished, by the accident that has befallen him, and I forgive him.”"
"“谢谢你，先生。”罗莎说。“现在你能告诉我，我能为你做什么吗？”","“I thank you, sir,” said Rosa.“And now tell me—oh, tell me—can I do anything for you?”"
"“你可以擦干你那双漂亮眼睛，我亲爱的孩子。”科尔内留斯说着，露出和蔼的笑容。","“You can dry your beautiful eyes, my dear child,” answered Cornelius, with a good-tempered smile."
"“可我能为你做些什么，为你？”","“But what can I do for you,—for you I mean?”"
"“一个人的生命如果只剩下一个钟头了，他还奢求什么的话，那他一定是个不折不扣的锡巴里斯人，亲爱的罗莎。” ","“A man who has only one hour longer to live must be a great Sybarite still to want anything, my dear Rosa.”"
"“他们跟你说的神父呢？”","“The clergyman whom they have proposed to you?”"
"“我一生都信奉上帝，崇拜他创造的世界，颂扬他的神圣旨意。我已经求得了心灵的安宁，我不需要神父。可我最后的想法还是关乎上帝的荣耀，而且，事实上，亲爱的，我想请你帮我实现这最后的想法。”","“I have worshipped God all my life, I have worshipped Him in His works, and praised Him in His decrees.I am at peace with Him and do not wish for a clergyman.The last thought which occupies my mind, however has reference to the glory of the Almighty, and, indeed, my dear, I should ask you to help me in carrying out this last thought.”"
"“啊！科尔内留斯先生，说吧！说吧！”罗莎喊道，哭得像个泪人儿。","“Oh, Mynheer Cornelius, speak, speak!” exclaimed Rosa, still bathed in tears."
"“把你的手给我，答应我不要笑，亲爱的孩子。”","“Give me your hand, and promise me not to laugh, my dear child.”"
"“笑？”罗莎惊呼道，悲痛欲绝，“这个时候还笑！你没看见我的泪水吗？”","“Laugh,” exclaimed Rosa, frantic with grief, “laugh at this moment! do you not see my tears?”"
"“罗莎，我也算是了解你了。虽然了解不够深，但足以让我欣赏你的品性。我从没见过哪个女人比你更美、更纯洁。如果从这刻起，我没再多看你一眼，那么请原谅我，这仅仅是因为我即将离开这个世界，我不希望自己有更多的遗憾。”","“Rosa, you are no stranger to me.I have not seen much of you, but that little is enough to make me appreciate your character.I have never seen a woman more fair or more pure than you are, and if from this moment I take no more notice of you, forgive me; it is only because, on leaving this world, I do not wish to have any further regret.”"
"当犯人说出这些话的时候，布伊坦霍夫的钟楼已经敲响了十一下，罗莎不寒而栗。","Rosa felt a shudder creeping over her frame, for, whilst the prisoner pronounced these words, the belfry clock of the Buytenhof struck eleven."
"科尔内留斯明白她在想什么。“对，对，咱们得快点说，”他说，“你想得对，罗莎。”","Cornelius understood her.“Yes, yes, let us make haste,” he said, “you are right, Rosa.”"
"然后他从怀里掏出包着三个球茎的纸包。他把东西重新揣在怀里，是因为他不用再担心被搜身了，他说：“亲爱的姑娘，我非常喜欢花儿。我曾经以为这世上除了花，没有别的什么东西值得去爱了。别脸红，罗莎，也别转过头去，尽管我刚刚在向你示爱，唉！可怜的孩子，那不会有任何结果了。再过六十分钟，下面的广场上的铁器就会结束我的冒昧。好啦，罗莎，花儿以前是我的挚爱，而且我已经发现了大黑郁金香的秘密，至少我这么觉得，以前人们都认为培育出黑郁金香是不可能的，而且，你也许知道，或许不知道，哈勒姆园艺协会专为此花设立了十万基尔德的奖金。　这十万基尔德——老天知道我惋惜的不是这钱——这十万基尔德就在这纸包里，这里面的三个球茎就能赢得十万基尔德的奖励。罗莎，你就拿着吧，我把它们当礼物送给你。”","Then, taking the paper with the three suckers from his breast, where he had again put it, since he had no longer any fear of being searched, he said: “My dear girl, I have been very fond of flowers.That was at a time when I did not know that there was anything else to be loved.Don’t blush, Rosa, nor turn away; and even if I were making you a declaration of love, alas! poor dear, it would be of no more consequence.Down there in the yard, there is an instrument of steel, which in sixty minutes will put an end to my boldness.Well, Rosa, I loved flowers dearly, and I have found, or at least I believe so, the secret of the great black tulip, which it has been considered impossible to grow, and for which, as you know, or may not know, a prize of a hundred thousand guilders has been offered by the Horticultural Society of Haarlem.These hundred thousand guilders—and Heaven knows I do not regret them—these hundred thousand guilders I have here in this paper, for they are won by the three bulbs wrapped up in it, which you may take, Rosa, as I make you a present of them.”"
"“科尔内留斯先生！”","“Mynheer Cornelius!”"
"“是啊，罗莎，你拿着吧。你并没有伤害任何人的利益，孩子。我一个人在这世上，父母双亡，又没个兄弟姐妹。我从没想过自己会真正爱上一个人，如果有人爱上了我，我也蒙在鼓里。况且，你也看到了，所有人都抛弃了我，因为在我落难的时刻，只有你在监狱里陪着我、宽慰我和帮助我。”","“Yes, yes, Rosa, you may take them; you are not wronging any one, my child.I am alone in this world; my parents are dead; I never had a sister or a brother.I have never had a thought of loving any one with what is called love, and if any one has loved me, I have not known it.However, you see well, Rosa, that I am abandoned by everybody, as in this sad hour you alone are with me in my prison, consoling and assisting me.”"
"“但是，先生，这可是十万基尔德啊！”","“But, sir, a hundred thousand guilders!”"
"“好吧，咱们认真严肃地谈一谈吧，孩子，这十万基尔德可是一笔不错的嫁妆，和你的美貌也相配。你应该接受，罗莎，亲爱的罗莎，我不求回报，只希望你答应，你一定要嫁一个你爱的、善良的年轻人，而他也得像我爱我的花儿那样爱你。亲爱的罗莎，别打断我的话，我只有几分钟了。”","“Well, let us talk seriously, my dear child: those hundred thousand guilders will be a nice marriage portion, with your pretty face; you shall have them, Rosa, dear Rosa, and I ask nothing in return but your promise that you will marry a fine young man, whom you love, and who will love you, as dearly as I loved my flowers.Don’t interrupt me, Rosa dear, I have only a few minutes more.”"
"可怜的姑娘又快泣不成声了。","The poor girl was nearly choking with her sobs."
"科尔内留斯握住了她的手。","Cornelius took her by the hand."
"“听我说，”他继续说，“我会告诉你怎么做。去多特找我的园丁皮特吕依斯汉姆，跟他要些六号花坛的土壤，用一个深一点的盒子装满，再把这三个球茎种下去。明年五月，也就是七个月后，它们就会开花。当你看到花茎上长出花苞时，就得小心了，晚上不能吹风，白天不能日晒。我能保证，它们一定能开出黑色郁金香。这时候你就可以告知哈勒姆协会的主席。他会召集协会成员证实花的颜色，然后就会支付给你十万基尔德了。","“Listen to me,” he continued: “I’ll tell you how to manage it.Go to Dort and ask Butruysheim, my gardener, for soil from my border number six, fill a deep box with it, and plant in it these three bulbs.They will flower next May, that is to say, in seven months; and, when you see the flower forming on the stem, be careful at night to protect them from the wind, and by day to screen them from the sun.They will flower black, I am quite sure of it.You are then to apprise the President of the Haarlem Society.He will cause the color of the flower to be proved before a committee and these hundred thousand guilders will be paid to you.”"
"罗莎深深地叹了口气。","Rosa heaved a deep sigh."
"“那么，”科尔内留斯继续说着，抹去了在眼里打转的泪水，这眼泪倒不是为他即将终结的生命而流，而是因为他无法亲眼看见奇异的黑郁金香了，“我没别的愿望，只希望这黑郁金香能被命名为‘罗莎巴尔莱’，就是我们俩的名字连在一起，当然，你不懂拉丁文，或许会忘了这名字，那你就帮我拿纸笔来，这样我就可以把它给你写下来了。”","“And now,” continued Cornelius,—wiping away a tear which was glistening in his eye, and which was shed much more for that marvellous black tulip which he was not to see than for the life which he was about to lose,—“I have no wish left, except that the tulip should be called Rosa Barlaensis, that is to say, that its name should combine yours and mine; and as, of course, you do not understand Latin, and might therefore forget this name, try to get for me pencil and paper, that I may write it down for you.”"
"罗莎又开始抽泣起来，递给他一本绿皮封面的书，上面写着“C. W.”的姓名首字母。","Rosa sobbed afresh, and handed to him a book, bound in shagreen, which bore the initials C. W."
"“这是什么？”犯人问。","“What is this?” asked the prisoner."
"“唉！”罗莎回答说，“这是你那可怜的教父，科尔内留斯·德维特留下的《圣经》。他就是从这本书中汲取了力量，他不仅忍受了酷刑，连听到对自己的判决都没有畏惧。这位殉难者死后，我在这间牢房里发现了它，就把它作为遗物保存了下来。今天，我把它拿给你，是因为我觉得这本书一定有股神力。你就把你要写的都写在这上面吧，科尔内留斯先生。虽然很遗憾，我不识字，但我一定会照你写的去做的。”","“Alas!” replied Rosa, “it is the Bible of your poor godfather, Cornelius de Witt.From it he derived strength to endure the torture, and to bear his sentence without flinching.I found it in this cell, after the death of the martyr, and have preserved it as a relic.To-day I brought it to you, for it seemed to me that this book must possess in itself a divine power.Write in it what you have to write, Mynheer Cornelius; and though, unfortunately, I am not able to read, I will take care that what you write shall be accomplished.”"
"科尔内留斯接过《圣经》，很虔诚地吻了一下。","Cornelius took the Bible, and kissed it reverently."
"“我用什么写呢？”科尔内留斯问。","“With what shall I write?” asked Cornelius."
"“这本书里有支铅笔。”罗莎说。","“There is a pencil in the Bible,” said Rosa."
"这支铅笔就是约翰·德维特给他哥哥用过，后来又忘了拿走的那支。","This was the pencil which John de Witt had lent to his brother, and which he had forgotten to take away with him."
"科尔内留斯拿起笔，在第二张扉页上（因为大家记得第一页已经被撕掉了），和他的教父一样，在临死前，用同样坚定的手写下如下文字：","Cornelius took it, and on the second fly leaf (for it will be remembered that the first was torn out), drawing near his end like his godfather, he wrote with a no less firm hand:—"
"“一六七二年八月二十三日，在我即将将我无辜的灵魂在断头台上献给上帝的时候，我将我现拥有的人世间唯一的财产赠与罗莎·格里弗斯，其余的都已经充公了，我要将三个球茎赠与给罗莎·格里弗斯。我深信这三个球茎会在明年五月开出大黑郁金香，因此赢得哈勒姆协会提供的十万基尔德的奖金，我请求允许罗莎，作为我唯一的继承人，代我领取同等金额的奖金，我唯一的条件就是，她要嫁一个与我年纪相仿、为人正派的年轻人，并且他们彼此相爱，她还要给培育的新品种黑郁金香命名为‘罗莎巴尔莱’，也就是她和我名字的结合。","“On this day, the 23d of August, 1672, being on the point of rendering, although innocent, my soul to God on the scaffold, I bequeath to Rosa Gryphus the only worldly goods which remain to me of all that I have possessed in this world, the rest having been confiscated; I bequeath, I say, to Rosa Gryphus three bulbs, which I am convinced must produce, in the next May, the Grand Black Tulip for which a prize of a hundred thousand guilders has been offered by the Haarlem Society, requesting that she may be paid the same sum in my stead, as my sole heiress, under the only condition of her marrying a respectable young man of about my age, who loves her, and whom she loves, and of her giving the black tulip, which will constitute a new species, the name of Rosa Barlaensis, that is to say, hers and mine combined."
"“请上帝赐予我仁慈，并赐予她健康和长寿！","“So may God grant me mercy, and to her health and long life!"
"“科尔内留斯·范巴尔莱。”","“Cornelius van Baerle.”"
"之后，犯人把《圣经》递给罗莎，说：","The prisoner then, giving the Bible to Rosa, said,—"
"“看看。”","“Read.”"
"“哎呀！”罗莎说，“我已经跟你说过了，我不识字。”","“Alas!” she answered, “I have already told you I cannot read.”"
"科尔内留斯就把他刚写的遗嘱念给罗莎听。","Cornelius then read to Rosa the testament that he had just made."
"这个可怜的姑娘痛苦得几乎难以自持了。","The agony of the poor girl almost overpowered her."
"“你接受我的条件吗？”犯人带着忧郁的笑容问，吻了吻这位伤心欲绝的姑娘颤抖的双手。","“Do you accept my conditions?” asked the prisoner, with a melancholy smile, kissing the trembling hands of the afflicted girl."
"“啊！我不知道，先生。”她结结巴巴地说。","“Oh, I don’t know, sir,” she stammered."
"“你不知道，孩子，怎么会呢？”","“You don’t know, child, and why not?”"
"“因为有一个条件恐怕我做不到。”","“Because there is one condition which I am afraid I cannot keep.”"
"“哪个条件？我还以为我们都说好了呢。”","“Which?I should have thought that all was settled between us.”"
"“你给我十万基尔德作为我的嫁妆，是吗？","“You give me the hundred thousand guilders as a marriage portion, don’t you?"
"条件是我得嫁一个我爱的人？”","“And under the condition of my marrying a man whom I love?”"
"“没错啊。”","“Certainly.”"
"“这样的话，先生，这钱我不能拿。我不会爱上任何人，我也不会嫁人。”","“Well, then, sir, this money cannot belong to me.I shall never love any one; neither shall I marry.”"
"罗莎吃力地说出这几句话，悲伤得几乎昏厥过去。","And, after having with difficulty uttered these words, Rosa almost swooned away in the violence of her grief."
"科尔内留斯看见她脸色苍白，身子往下沉，吓坏了，刚要上前抱住她，这时，在一阵狗吠声中，楼道传来了沉重的脚步声，紧随其后的还有其他可怕的声音。","Cornelius, frightened at seeing her so pale and sinking, was going to take her in his arms, when a heavy step, followed by other dismal sounds, was heard on the staircase, amidst the continued barking of the dog."
"“他们要带你走了。哦，上帝啊！上帝啊！”罗莎绝望地绞拧着双手，叫道，“你难道再没有什么要跟我说的吗？”","“They are coming to fetch you.Oh God! Oh God!” cried Rosa, wringing her hands.“And have you nothing more to tell me?”"
"她跪在地上，掩面哭泣，哭得几乎不省人事。","She fell on her knees with her face buried in her hands and became almost senseless."
"“我只想说，我希望你把这三个球茎当作稀世珍宝一样，把它们收好，按照我刚才说的善待它们。就当是为我做的。永别了，罗莎！”","“I have only to say, that I wish you to preserve these bulbs as a most precious treasure, and carefully to treat them according to the directions I have given you.Do it for my sake, and now farewell, Rosa.”"
"“好的，好的。”罗莎低着头说，“我会照你吩咐的去做，除了嫁人，”她低声补充道，“因为那，啊！那对我来说是不可能的。”","“Yes, yes,” she said, without raising her head, “I will do anything you bid me, except marrying,” she added, in a low voice, “for that, oh! that is impossible for me.”"
"于是她把那珍贵的宝物放在她砰砰直跳的胸口。","She then put the cherished treasure next her beating heart."
"科尔内留斯和罗莎刚刚听到的楼道上的声音是书记官发出的，他是来带犯人的。他后面跟着行刑人、断头台的卫兵，还有一些监狱里来看热闹的人。","The noise on the staircase which Cornelius and Rosa had heard was caused by the Recorder, who was coming for the prisoner.He was followed by the executioner, by the soldiers who were to form the guard round the scaffold, and by some curious hangers-on of the prison."
"科尔内留斯既临危不乱，又不逞匹夫之勇，他像迎接朋友一样，迎接这些迫害者，他平静地听任这群人的摆布，他知道他们不过是履行他们的职责而已。","Cornelius, without showing any weakness, but likewise without any bravado, received them rather as friends than as persecutors, and quietly submitted to all those preparations which these men were obliged to make in performance of their duty."
"科尔内留斯从牢房的铁条窗瞥了一眼广场，他瞧见了断头台，就在离断头台二十步远的地方，遭到暴徒凌辱的德维特兄弟的尸体，已经得到总督的命令，从绞刑架上卸了下来。","Then, casting a glance into the yard through the narrow iron-barred window of his cell, he perceived the scaffold, and, at twenty paces distant from it, the gibbet, from which, by order of the Stadtholder, the outraged remains of the two brothers De Witt had been taken down."
"当科尔内留斯跟着卫兵，准备下楼的时候，他用目光搜寻着罗莎那张天使般的面孔，可他看到的，是剑、戟的寒光背后瘫倒在木凳边的躯体，还有被金色长发遮住了一半的、惨白的脸。","When the moment came to descend in order to follow the guards, Cornelius sought with his eyes the angelic look of Rosa, but he saw, behind the swords and halberds, only a form lying outstretched near a wooden bench, and a deathlike face half covered with long golden locks."
"虽然罗莎昏倒的时候，已经不省人事了，可她仍旧恪守着对她朋友的诺言，她用手护着她天鹅绒的胸衣，忘记了周围世界的一切，本能地紧握科尔内留斯托她保管的宝贝。","But Rosa, whilst falling down senseless, still obeying her friend, had pressed her hand on her velvet bodice and, forgetting everything in the world besides, instinctively grasped the precious deposit which Cornelius had intrusted to her care."
"年轻人离开牢房的时候，仍可以看见在罗莎紧握的、痉挛的手指之间，从《圣经》上撕下的发黄的纸页。科尔内留斯·德维特曾克服重重困难，忍着痛在上面写下了几行文字，要是范巴尔莱看了，毫无疑问，这几行字现在也能救一个人的性命和一朵郁金香。","Leaving the cell, the young man could still see in the convulsively clinched fingers of Rosa the yellowish leaf from that Bible on which Cornelius de Witt had with such difficulty and pain written these few lines, which, if Van Baerle had read them, would undoubtedly have been the saving of a man and a tulip."
"第十二章 处决","Chapter 12 The Execution"
"科尔内留斯出了监狱，走了不到三百步就来到了断头台下。在楼梯底部，那只狗静静地注视着他走过，科尔内留斯甚至从这只狗的眼睛里读出了某种类似于怜悯的表情。","Cornelius had not three hundred paces to walk outside the prison to reach the foot of the scaffold.At the bottom of the staircase, the dog quietly looked at him whilst he was passing; Cornelius even fancied he saw in the eyes of the monster a certain expression as it were of compassion."
"狗也许认得被定了死罪的犯人，只会咬那些重获自由的人。","The dog perhaps knew the condemned prisoners, and only bit those who left as free men."
"从监狱大门到断头台下的距离越短，看热闹的人自然会越拥挤。","The shorter the way from the door of the prison to the foot of the scaffold, the more fully, of course, it was crowded with curious people."
"这群人，觉得三天前他们亲手制造的血腥场面还不够过瘾，现在又渴望着另一个新的牺牲者倒在血泊中。","These were the same who, not satisfied with the blood which they had shed three days before, were now craving for a new victim."
"科尔内留斯一现身，立即激起了整条街的怨骂声。骂声迅速传遍了广场，回荡在所有通往断头台的街道上，那些街道也密密麻麻地站满了看客。","And scarcely had Cornelius made his appearance than a fierce groan ran through the whole street, spreading all over the yard, and re-echoing from the streets which led to the scaffold, and which were likewise crowded with spectators."
"断头台因此看上去像是好几条河流交汇处的小岛。","The scaffold indeed looked like an islet at the confluence of several rivers."
"面对这些恐吓、叫骂和喊叫，科尔内留斯很可能是有意充耳不闻，他沉浸在自己的思绪之中。","In the midst of these threats, groans, and yells, Cornelius, very likely in order not to hear them, had buried himself in his own thoughts."
"在他通向死亡的忧伤之旅的途中，他会想些什么呢？","And what did he think of in his last melancholy journey?"
"他想的不是他的仇人，也不是审判他的法官和他的行刑人。","Neither of his enemies, nor of his judges, nor of his executioners."
"他想到的是，他会在天国遥看盛开在锡兰、孟加拉或者其他地方的美丽郁金香，那时候他会心怀怜悯地俯视人间众生。在人间，约翰和科尔内留斯·德维特兄弟因为潜心于政治而被杀害。在人间，他科尔内留斯·范巴尔莱也因为热爱郁金香而即将被斩首。","He thought of the beautiful tulips which he would see from heaven above, at Ceylon, or Bengal, or elsewhere, when he would be able to look with pity on this earth, where John and Cornelius de Witt had been murdered for having thought too much of politics, and where Cornelius van Baerle was about to be murdered for having thought too much of tulips."
"“不就是一刀砍下去的事嘛。”这位哲人自言自语道，“而且我的美丽梦想终于可以开始实现了。”","“It is only one stroke of the axe,” said the philosopher to himself, “and my beautiful dream will begin to be realised.”"
"当然，也不排除这样的可能，就像之前的德沙莱和德杜先生以及其他被砍得不利索的人一样，不止挨行刑人一刀，也就是说，这个可怜的郁金香爱好者可能得不止一次地受难。","Only there was still a chance, just as it had happened before to M. de Chalais, to M. de Thou, and other slovenly executed people, that the headsman might inflict more than one stroke, that is to say, more than one martyrdom, on the poor tulip-fancier."
"尽管如此，范巴尔莱还是丝毫没有犹豫地走上了断头台，身为赫赫有名的约翰·德维特的朋友、高尚的科尔内留斯·德维特的教子，他为自己感到自豪，三天前那群暴徒将那两兄弟碎尸万段，烧成了灰烬，现在他们又挤在这里等着看他倒下。","Yet, notwithstanding all this, Van Baerle mounted the scaffold not the less resolutely, proud of having been the friend of that illustrious John, and godson of that noble Cornelius de Witt, whom the ruffians, who were now crowding to witness his own doom, had torn to pieces and burnt three days before."
"他跪下来祈祷，把头枕在石板上，带着一种由衷的喜悦，观察着周围的一切，他注意到，即使是在临死的最后一刻，他也能瞧见布伊坦霍夫监狱的铁窗。","He knelt down, said his prayers, and observed, not without a feeling of sincere joy, that, laying his head on the block, and keeping his eyes open, he would be able to his last moment to see the grated window of the Buytenhof."
"行刑的时间终于到了，科尔内留斯把他的下巴搁在冰冷而又潮湿的石板上。但也就在那一瞬间，他不自觉地闭上了眼，这样他就能更毅然决然地承受落在自己脖子上的那一斧头，就如同等待一场可怕的雪崩，吞没自己的生命。","At length the fatal moment arrived, and Cornelius placed his chin on the cold damp block.But at this moment his eyes closed involuntarily, to receive more resolutely the terrible avalanche which was about to fall on his head, and to engulf his life."
"一道如闪电般的寒光划过断头台，那是行刑人举起了他的刀。","A gleam like that of lightning passed across the scaffold: it was the executioner raising his sword."
"范巴尔莱同他的大黑郁金香永别，他深信自己会在另一个瑰丽光明的世界醒来。","Van Baerle bade farewell to the great black tulip, certain of awaking in another world full of light and glorious tints."
"他三次感到自己的脖子上有一股子刀刃的寒气，不禁打了个寒噤，可真是奇怪！他既不觉得痛，也没感觉到刀砍过来的冲力。","Three times he felt, with a shudder, the cold current of air from the knife near his neck, but what a surprise! he felt neither pain nor shock."
"他看天空的颜色和周围的世界都没什么变化。","He saw no change in the colour of the sky, or of the world around him."
"之后他忽然感到有人轻轻地扶起他，他很快又站了起来，尽管有些发抖。","Then suddenly Van Baerle felt gentle hands raising him, and soon stood on his feet again, although trembling a little."
"他环顾四周。一个人站在他身旁，念着一张大羊皮纸文书，文书上盖着一个大大的红腊印章。","He looked around him.There was some one by his side, reading a large parchment, sealed with a huge seal of red wax."
"还是同样的太阳，闪耀在空中，惨淡的黄色，似乎荷兰的太阳理应如此；还是同样的铁窗，从布伊坦霍夫监狱俯瞰着他；还是同样的一群暴民，嘴里不再嚷嚷了，都目瞪口呆地站在下面的街道上盯着他。","And the same sun, yellow and pale, as it behooves a Dutch sun to be, was shining in the skies; and the same grated window looked down upon him from the Buytenhof; and the same rabble, no longer yelling, but completely thunderstruck, were staring at him from the streets below."
"范巴尔莱这才明白了周遭发生了什么。","Van Baerle began to be sensible to what was going on around him."
"可能是因为担心范巴尔莱的鲜血会使他失去拥护支持，所以奥兰治亲王威廉满怀同情地考虑到了巴尔莱善良的本性和那些证明他无罪的明确证据。","His Highness, William, Prince of Orange, very likely afraid that Van Baerle’s blood would turn the scale of judgment against him, had compassionately taken into consideration his good character, and the apparent proofs of his innocence."
"亲王殿下因此赦免了他的死罪。","His Highness, accordingly, had granted him his life."
"科尔内留斯起初还奢望是完全赦免了他，这样他就可以重获自由，回到他多特的花坛边。","Cornelius at first hoped that the pardon would be complete, and that he would be restored to his full liberty and to his flower borders at Dort."
"可是科尔内留斯想错了。援引差不多同时期的德塞维尼夫人的一句话来说，“信后还有附言的，”而这封信最重要的部分就在附言里。","But Cornelius was mistaken.To use an expression of Madame de Sevigne, who wrote about the same time, “there was a postscript to the letter;” and the most important part of the letter was contained in the postscript."
"附言里，荷兰总督奥兰治亲王威廉判处科尔内留斯·范巴尔莱终身监禁。他虽罪不至死，但释放他似乎又太便宜他了。","In this postscript, William of Orange, Stadtholder of Holland, condemned Cornelius van Baerle to imprisonment for life.He was not sufficiently guilty to suffer death, but he was too much so to be set at liberty."
"科尔内留斯听到这一条款，起初有些气恼和失望，后又转念一想：","Cornelius heard this clause, but, the first feeling of vexation and disappointment over, he said to himself,—"
"“没关系，总算没有失去一切。终身监禁也有好的方面，罗莎会在身边，还有我那三个黑郁金香的球茎。”","“Never mind, all this is not lost yet; there is some good in this perpetual imprisonment; Rosa will be there, and also my three bulbs of the black tulip are there.”"
"不过科尔内留斯忘了七省联邦有七所监狱，每省一所，而且和首都海牙相比，其他每所监狱的食宿都会相对便宜些。","But Cornelius forgot that the Seven Provinces had seven prisons, one for each, and that the board of the prisoner is anywhere else less expensive than at the Hague, which is a capital."
"亲王殿下好像没办法在海牙监狱养活范巴尔莱似的，竟把他打发到洛维斯坦因监狱，让他在那里服刑，那地方离多特倒是挺近，可是，唉！却又是咫尺天涯啊，因为按照地理学家的说法，罗维斯坦因坐落于瓦尔河和马斯河交汇而成的小岛上，正对着戈尔肯。","His Highness, who, as it seems, did not possess the means to feed Van Baerle at the Hague, sent him to undergo his perpetual imprisonment at the fortress of Loewestein, very near Dort, but, alas! also very far from it; for Loewestein, as the geographers tell us, is situated at the point of the islet which is formed by the confluence of the Waal and the Meuse, opposite Gorcum."
"精通本国历史的范巴尔莱清楚，巴纳维尔特死后，大名鼎鼎的格劳休斯就被囚禁在那座城堡，而且国会对这位卓越的政治家、法理学家、历史学家、诗人和神学家很慷慨，每天给他二十四个铜子作为他的日常开销。","Van Baerle was sufficiently versed in the history of his country to know that the celebrated Grotius was confined in that castle after the death of Barneveldt; and that the States, in their generosity to the illustrious publicist, jurist, historian, poet, and divine, had granted to him for his daily maintenance the sum of twenty-four stivers."
"“我，”范巴尔莱自言自语道，“我和格劳休斯相比差远了。他们最多给我十二个铜子，我今后的日子一定很悲惨，不过没关系，不管怎样我都会活下去。”","“I,” said Van Baerle to himself, “I am worth much less than Grotius.They will hardly give me twelve stivers, and I shall live miserably; but never mind, at all events I shall live.”"
"接着，他忽然想到一件糟糕的事。","Then suddenly a terrible thought struck him."
"“啊！”他叫道，“那地方潮湿多雾，对郁金香非常不利啊！还有，罗莎也不在洛维斯坦因！”","“Ah!” he exclaimed, “how damp and misty that part of the country is, and the soil so bad for the tulips!And then Rosa will not be at Loewestein!”"
"第十三章 一名看客这段时间心境的变化","Chapter 13 What Was Going on All This Time in the Mind of One of the Spectators"
"当科尔内留斯还沉浸于自己的思绪时，一辆马车驶向了断头台。这辆马车是来接犯人的。他们叫犯人上车，科尔内留斯听从了命令。","Whilst Cornelius was engaged with his own thoughts, a coach had driven up to the scaffold.This vehicle was for the prisoner.He was invited to enter it, and he obeyed."
"他最后将目光投向了布伊坦霍夫监狱。他希冀能在窗口瞥见罗莎重新焕发神采的脸。","His last look was towards the Buytenhof.He hoped to see at the window the face of Rosa, brightening up again."
"可是马儿拉着车使劲朝前跑，立马就载着范巴尔莱从人群的欢呼声中离开，那些人正颂扬着他们最宽宏大量的总督，其中也混杂着对德维特兄弟及其刚刚死里逃生的教子的辱骂。","But the coach was drawn by good horses, who soon carried Van Baerle away from among the shouts which the rabble roared in honour of the most magnanimous Stadtholder, mixing with it a spice of abuse against the brothers De Witt and the godson of Cornelius, who had just now been saved from death."
"这一决定让那些可敬的看客纷纷说：","This reprieve suggested to the worthy spectators remarks such as the following:—"
"“幸亏我们迅速处决了大恶棍约翰和小无赖科尔内留斯，不然的话，说不定亲王殿下会像救这小子一样，把他从我们手里抢走呢。”","“It’s very fortunate that we used such speed in having justice done to that great villain John, and to that little rogue Cornelius, otherwise his Highness might have snatched them from us, just as he has done this fellow.”"
"范巴尔莱的处决吸引了众多的看客来到了布伊坦霍夫广场，情况的急剧变化多少让他们不悦和震惊，可这群看客中，最为失望的无疑是一个穿着体面的市民，他一大早就手脚并用地挤到了离断头台只有一步之遥的位置，中间只隔着一列看守断头台的士兵。","Among all the spectators whom Van Baerle’s execution had attracted to the Buytenhof, and whom the sudden turn of affairs had disagreeably surprised, undoubtedly the one most disappointed was a certain respectably dressed burgher, who from early morning had made such a good use of his feet and elbows that he at last was separated from the scaffold only by the file of soldiers which surrounded it."
"很多人都迫切地想看到背信弃义的罪犯科尔内留思的鲜血流淌，可是没有谁如刚刚提及的那个市民一样，表现出如此急切的渴望。","Many had shown themselves eager to see the perfidious blood of the guilty Cornelius flow, but not one had shown such a keen anxiety as the individual just alluded to."
"最愤怒的人们为了抢占有利位置，拂晓时分就来到了布伊坦霍夫广场。可他比他们来得更早，他在监狱门口熬了一宿，而且正如我们前面介绍的，他从监狱门口一直挤到了最前排，unguibus et rosto，也就是说，软磨硬泡的招数都使尽了。","The most furious had come to the Buytenhof at daybreak, to secure a better place; but he, outdoing even them, had passed the night at the threshold of the prison, from whence, as we have already said, he had advanced to the very foremost rank, unguibus et rostro,—that is to say, coaxing some, and kicking the others."
"当行刑人领着犯人走上断头台时，这位市民早已爬到？上，就是为了看得更清楚，也为了让别人更清楚地看到自己，他朝行刑人做了个手势，意思是：　","And when the executioner had conducted the prisoner to the scaffold, the burgher, who had mounted on the stone of the pump the better to see and be seen, made to the executioner a sign which meant,—"
"“咱们说定了，对吧？”","“It’s a bargain, isn’t it?”"
"行刑人也用手势回答道：","The executioner answered by another sign, which was meant to say,—"
"“别声张，放心好了。”","“Be quiet, it’s all right.”"
"这位市民不是别人，正是伊萨克·博克斯戴尔先生，科尔内留思被逮捕那天，他就来到了海牙，想把那三个黑郁金香的球茎弄到手。","This burgher was no other than Mynheer Isaac Boxtel, who since the arrest of Cornelius had come to the Hague to try if he could not get hold of the three bulbs of the black tulip."
"博克斯戴尔起初想买通格里弗斯，可这名监狱看守不仅像狗一样凶猛咆哮，还有狗一般的忠诚。因此他对博克斯戴尔的仇恨警觉起来，并误以为他是犯人一个热心的朋友，在这里打探些琐事无外乎是想策划一个让犯人逃出监狱的更万无一失的办法。","Boxtel had at first tried to gain over Gryphus to his interest, but the jailer had not only the snarling fierceness, but likewise the fidelity, of a dog.He had therefore bristled up at Boxtel’s hatred, whom he had suspected to be a warm friend of the prisoner, making trifling inquiries to contrive with the more certainty some means of escape for him."
"博克斯戴尔认为科尔内留思·范巴尔莱如果不是把球茎藏在怀里，至少是藏在牢房的某个角落。可他刚一提出，希望格里弗斯能帮他偷出球茎，坏脾气的格里弗斯就很干脆地把他撵走了，并放狗咬他。","Thus to the very first proposals which Boxtel made to Gryphus to filch the bulbs which Cornelius van Baerle must be supposed to conceal, if not in his breast, at least in some corner of his cell, the surly jailer had only answered by kicking Mynheer Isaac out, and setting the dog at him."
"博克斯戴尔并没有因为自己的裤裆被狗扯下一片而退却。他又来了一次，可这次格里弗斯折了胳膊，发着高烧，卧床不起。因此恳请人没能见到格里弗斯的面，他转而求助于罗莎，许诺只要她能帮他弄到球茎，就给她买一个纯金头饰。听到此，作为犯人的继承者，这位善良的姑娘尽管对开出如此高价钱去偷盗的物品的价值毫不知情，她还是打发引诱者去找行刑人。","The piece which the mastiff had torn from his hose did not discourage Boxtel.He came back to the charge, but this time Gryphus was in bed, feverish, and with a broken arm.He therefore was not able to admit the petitioner, who then addressed himself to Rosa, offering to buy her a head-dress of pure gold if she would get the bulbs for him.On this, the generous girl, although not yet knowing the value of the object of the robbery, which was to be so well remunerated, had directed the tempter to the executioner, as the heir of the prisoner."
"其间，判决下来了。这样的话，伊萨克根本来不及贿赂任何人。因此，他打定主意，就如罗莎所建议的那样：去找行刑人。","In the meanwhile the sentence had been pronounced.Thus Isaac had no more time to bribe any one.He therefore clung to the idea which Rosa had suggested: he went to the executioner."
"伊萨克丝毫不怀疑科尔内留斯会揣着球茎死。","Isaac had not the least doubt that Cornelius would die with the bulbs on his heart."
"可他有两样东西没算计到：","But there were two things which Boxtel did not calculate upon:—"
"一是罗莎，也就是爱情。","Rosa, that is to say, love;"
"二是奥兰治亲王威廉，也就是仁慈。","William of Orange, that is to say, clemency."
"要不是罗莎和威廉，这个满怀嫉妒的邻居的如意算盘绝对不会落空。","But for Rosa and William, the calculations of the envious neighbour would have been correct."
"要不是威廉，科尔内留斯定会命绝。","But for William, Cornelius would have died."
"要不是罗莎，科尔内留斯定会揣着他的球茎死。","But for Rosa, Cornelius would have died with his bulbs on his heart."
"博克斯戴尔先生去找刽子手，他冒充犯人的好友，说要花一百基尔德从刽子手那里买回死者的衣物；更为可观的是，他还许诺要将所有的金银首饰留给行刑人。","Mynheer Boxtel went to the headsman, to whom he gave himself out as a great friend of the condemned man; and from whom he bought all the clothes of the dead man that was to be, for one hundred guilders; rather an exorbitant sum, as he engaged to leave all the trinkets of gold and silver to the executioner."
"一百基尔德，对一个几乎完全有把握用它买到哈勒姆协会奖金的人来说，又算得了什么？","But what was the sum of a hundred guilders to a man who was all but sure to buy with it the prize of the Haarlem Society?"
"这可是一本万利的买卖，谁都不会否认，这可是相当可观的投资。","It was money lent at a thousand per cent., which, as nobody will deny, was a very handsome investment."
"刽子手呢，几乎什么事都不做，就能挣一百基尔德。他唯一要做的就是，处决一结束，就让博克斯戴尔先生和他的仆人爬上断头台，拿走他死去的朋友身上的衣物。","The headsman, on the other hand, had scarcely anything to do to earn his hundred guilders.He needed only, as soon as the execution was over, to allow Mynheer Boxtel to ascend the scaffold with his servants, to remove the inanimate remains of his friend."
"况且，这也是合乎兄弟间的“忠肝义胆”这一情理的，很多人当他们的主人在布伊坦霍夫广场当众被处死的时候，都会这么做。","The thing was, moreover, quite customary among the “faithful brethren,” when one of their masters died a public death in the yard of the Buytenhof."
"既然有科尔内留斯这样的疯子，出现另一个愿意花一百基尔德买他遗物的疯子也不是什么稀奇事。","A fanatic like Cornelius might very easily have found another fanatic who would give a hundred guilders for his remains."
"行刑人欣然答应了博克斯戴尔的请求，只讲了一个条件，就是要他先付钱。","The executioner also readily acquiesced in the proposal, making only one condition,—that of being paid in advance."
"博克斯戴尔，或许会同集市里看表演的人一样，看完了很失望，然后一个子儿都不肯付就想走。","Boxtel, like the people who enter a show at a fair, might be disappointed, and refuse to pay on going out."
"博克斯戴尔提前付了钱，然后等待着。","Boxtel paid in advance, and waited."
"如此，读者们也许会想象着博克斯戴尔如何激动，如何焦虑地看着卫兵、书记官和行刑人，如何兴趣盎然地审视着范巴尔莱的一举一动。他会怎样把头枕在砧板上呢？他会怎样倒下呢？他会不会在倒下的时候压坏那些极其贵重的球茎呢？他至少会小心地把他们放在一个金盒子里吧——因为金子是最坚硬的金属？","After this, the reader may imagine how excited Boxtel was; with what anxiety he watched the guards, the Recorder, and the executioner; and with what intense interest he surveyed the movements of Van Baerle.How would he place himself on the block? how would he fall? and would he not, in falling, crush those inestimable bulbs? had not he at least taken care to enclose them in a golden box,—as gold is the hardest of all metals?"
"任何一个无足轻重的耽搁都会让他抓狂。那个愚蠢的刽子手为什么浪费时间拿刀在科尔内留斯的头上晃来晃去，而不是一刀把他的头砍下来呢？","Every trifling delay irritated him.Why did that stupid executioner thus lose time in brandishing his sword over the head of Cornelius, instead of cutting that head off?"
"可是当他看见书记官搀着犯人的手把他扶起来，并从口袋里掏出了一张羊皮纸——当他听到当众宣读的总督赦免令时——博克斯戴尔简直就不像人了，他目露凶光，叫喊和举动无不渗透着老虎、鬣狗抑或是毒蛇的狂暴和恶毒。如果他能够得着范巴尔莱，他一定会猛扑过去，一把掐死他。","But when he saw the Recorder take the hand of the condemned, and raise him, whilst drawing forth the parchment from his pocket,—when he heard the pardon of the Stadtholder publicly read out,—then Boxtel was no more like a human being; the rage and malice of the tiger, of the hyena, and of the serpent glistened in his eyes, and vented itself in his yell and his movements.Had he been able to get at Van Baerle, he would have pounced upon him and strangled him."
"如此说来，科尔内留斯还会活着，会去洛维斯坦因，他会带着他的球茎去他的监狱。说不定他还能找个花园，让他的黑郁金香开花呢。","And so, then, Cornelius was to live, and was to go with him to Loewestein, and thither to his prison he would take with him his bulbs; and perhaps he would even find a garden where the black tulip would flower for him."
"博克斯戴尔，在抑制不住的狂怒下，从石头上摔了下来，正好摔到一群奥兰治派的身上，这群人，同他一样，正对情况的转变极为不满。他们错把伊萨克先生的狂叫声当作快乐的表现，于是对他拳脚相加，他们打伊萨克的方式估计会让任何一位英吉利海峡对岸的职业拳击手都自愧不如。","Boxtel, quite overcome by his frenzy, fell from the stone upon some Orangemen, who, like him, were sorely vexed at the turn which affairs had taken.They, mistaking the frantic cries of Mynheer Isaac for demonstrations of joy, began to belabour him with kicks and cuffs, such as could not have been administered in better style by any prize-fighter on the other side of the Channel."
"然而，这些拳头对伊萨克来说算得了什么。他想去追那辆载着科尔内留斯和他的球茎的马车。可是慌乱中，他没看见脚下的一块铺路石，失去重心，连滚带爬地摔出几米远。海牙民众用他们泥泞的双脚从他身上踩过，当他再站起来的时候，已经伤痕累累，浑身污秽不堪了。","Blows were, however, nothing to him.He wanted to run after the coach which was carrying away Cornelius with his bulbs.But in his hurry he overlooked a paving-stone in his way, stumbled, lost his centre of gravity, rolled over to a distance of some yards, and only rose again, bruised and begrimed, after the whole rabble of the Hague, with their muddy feet, had passed over him."
"也许你会想这一天已经够糟糕的了，可博克斯戴尔先生并不这么想，因为，除了被扯破的衣服、满是瘀痕的后背、被刮伤的双手，他还要进一步惩罚自己，一把把抓掉自己的头发，去祭奠那个叫做的忌妒的女神，神话里告诉我们，忌妒之神戴着毒蛇的头饰。","One would think that this was enough for one day, but Mynheer Boxtel did not seem to think so, as, in addition to having his clothes torn, his back bruised, and his hands scratched, he inflicted upon himself the further punishment of tearing out his hair by handfuls, as an offering to that goddess of envy who, as mythology teaches us, wears a head-dress of serpents."
"第十四章 多特的鸽子","Chapter 14 The Pigeons of Dort"
"被关押在博学大师格劳休斯曾经待过的监狱，对科内尔留斯·范巴尔莱来说确实是莫大的荣幸。","It was indeed in itself a great honour for Cornelius van Baerle to be confined in the same prison which had once received the learned master Grotius."
"可等他到了监狱才发现，还有更大的荣幸等着他。得益于奥兰治亲王的仁慈，当郁金香迷范巴尔莱被送到监狱的时候，曾经关押杰出的巴纳维尔特的牢房碰巧空出来了。","But on arriving at the prison he met with an honour even greater.As chance would have it, the cell formerly inhabited by the illustrious Barneveldt happened to be vacant, when the clemency of the Prince of Orange sent the tulip-fancier Van Baerle there."
"这牢房自格劳休斯仰仗他妻子的妙计，利用看守疏于检查的书箱从监狱里逃出的那天起，就在监狱里得了一个坏名声。","The cell had a very bad character at the castle since the time when Grotius, by means of the device of his wife, made escape from it in that famous book-chest which the jailers forgot to examine."
"可是另一方面，在范巴尔莱看来，安排他住这个牢房乃是吉兆，因为照他的想法，监狱看守决不会让第二只鸽子关在前一只鸽子轻易就能飞走的笼子里。","On the other hand, it seemed to Van Baerle an auspicious omen that this very cell was assigned to him, for according to his ideas, a jailer ought never to have given to a second pigeon the cage from which the first had so easily flown."
"这牢房在历史上可是出了名的。我们只想在这里描述一下，这牢房，除了应格劳休斯夫人的要求设计的凹室外，在其他方面与别的牢房没什么两样。唯一的差别或许是牢房地势较高，从铁窗望出去的风景不错。","The cell had an historical character.We will only state here that, with the exception of an alcove which was contrived there for the use of Madame Grotius, it differed in no respect from the other cells of the prison; only, perhaps, it was a little higher, and had a splendid view from the grated window."
"科尔内留斯对自己的生存环境毫无兴趣，反正他不得不过着跟植物没什么差别的生活。他只关注两样东西，也只有这两样东西才能让他在想象中体会到幸福与快乐。　","Cornelius felt himself perfectly indifferent as to the place where he had to lead an existence which was little more than vegetation.There were only two things now for which he cared, and the possession of which was a happiness enjoyed only in imagination."
"一朵花和一个女人，这两样东西，在他看来，他永远地失去了。","A flower, and a woman; both of them, as he conceived, lost to him for ever."
"幸运地是，这位善良的医生想错了。在他的牢房里，任何一位郁金香爱好者都从未经历的惊险生活就为他准备着。","Fortunately the good doctor was mistaken.In his prison cell the most adventurous life which ever fell to the lot of any tulip-fancier was reserved for him."
"一个早晨，当他在窗口呼吸着河风吹来的新鲜空气时，他无限怀念地眺望着久违的多特，隔着林立的烟囱，看着远方隐约可见的风车，这时他看见成群的鸽子从那个方向飞来，扑扇着翅膀栖落在洛维斯坦因的山墙顶上。","One morning, whilst at his window inhaling the fresh air which came from the river, and casting a longing look to the windmills of his dear old city Dort, which were looming in the distance behind a forest of chimneys, he saw flocks of pigeons coming from that quarter to perch fluttering on the pointed gables of Loewestein."
"范巴尔莱自言自语道，这些鸽子是从多特来的，它们最后还是会回到那里。在其中一只鸽子的翅膀下拴一个小纸条，说不定还能捎信到那里。片刻的考虑之后，他喊道：","These pigeons, Van Baerle said to himself, are coming from Dort, and consequently may return there.By fastening a little note to the wing of one of these pigeons, one might have a chance to send a message there.Then, after a few moments’ consideration, he exclaimed,—"
"“我就这么做。”","“I will do it.”"
"一个人二十八岁就被判处终身监禁，也就是说，他要在监狱里呆上两万两千到两万三千个日日夜夜，在这样的情况下，人往往会变得很有耐性。","A man grows very patient who is twenty-eight years of age, and condemned to a prison for life,—that is to say, to something like twenty-two or twenty-three thousand days of captivity."
"范巴尔莱无时不牵挂着那三个球茎，他设下了捉鸽子的机关，从他每天八个铜子（英国六便士）的伙食中省下各种食物作为诱饵。忙活了一个月毫无收获，最终他捉到了一只雌鸽子。","Van Baerle, from whose thoughts the three bulbs were never absent, made a snare for catching the pigeons, baiting the birds with all the resources of his kitchen, such as it was for eight slivers (sixpence English) a day; and, after a month of unsuccessful attempts, he at last caught a female bird."
"他又花了两个多月的时间捉到一只雄鸽子，然后把它们关到一起，一六七三年初，鸽子生了蛋，他就放飞了雌鸽子，留下雄鸽子来代为孵蛋，雌鸽子带着翅膀下的字条，欢快地飞向多特。","It cost him two more months to catch a male bird; he then shut them up together, and having about the beginning of the year 1673 obtained some eggs from them, he released the female, which, leaving the male behind to hatch the eggs in her stead, flew joyously to Dort, with the note under her wing."
"她晚上归来。字条还在。","She returned in the evening.She had preserved the note."
"这样一直持续了十五天，范巴尔莱最初还只是失望，到后来简直就是绝望了。","Thus it went on for fifteen days, at first to the disappointment, and then to the great grief, of Van Baerle."
"终于，第十六天，她回来了，字条没了。","On the sixteenth day, at last, she came back without it."
"范巴尔莱这封信是写给他奶妈的，那个上了年纪的弗里斯兰女人。他恳请任何可能发现字条的人能行行善，尽快安全地把字条给她送过去。","Van Baerle had addressed it to his nurse, the old Frisian woman; and implored any charitable soul who might find it to convey it to her as safely and as speedily as possible."
"在这封信里还附有给罗莎的字条。","In this letter there was a little note enclosed for Rosa."
"范巴尔莱的奶妈收到信的经过是这样的。","Van Baerle’s nurse had received the letter in the following way."
"伊萨克·博克斯戴尔离开多特时，不仅丢下了他的房子、仆人、他的观察台和望远镜，他还丢下了他的鸽子。","Leaving Dort, Mynheer Isaac Boxtel had abandoned, not only his house, his servants, his observatory, and his telescope, but also his pigeons."
"博克斯戴尔走的时候没给仆人工钱，仆人起先靠自己仅有的一点积蓄过活，后来就吃起鸽子来。","The servant, having been left without wages, first lived on his little savings, and then on his master’s pigeons."
"鸽子见状，就从伊萨克·博克斯戴尔的房顶迁到了科尔内留斯·范巴尔莱的房顶上。","Seeing this, the pigeons emigrated from the roof of Isaac Boxtel to that of Cornelius van Baerle."
"奶妈是个菩萨心肠的人，生活中缺少爱的对象就没办法活下去。她对那些仰仗她盛情款待的鸽子疼爱有加。当博克斯戴尔的仆人来讨鸽子，准备拿它们果腹的时候——他已经吃了前十五只鸽子，现在要吃剩下的十五只——奶妈以每只鸽子六个铜子的补偿买下了鸽子。","The nurse was a kind-hearted woman, who could not live without something to love.She conceived an affection for the pigeons which had thrown themselves on her hospitality; and when Boxtel’s servant reclaimed them with culinary intentions, having eaten the first fifteen already, and now wishing to eat the other fifteen, she offered to buy them from him for a consideration of six stivers per head."
"这可是鸽子价钱的两倍，仆人欣然接受了，这样奶妈就名正言顺地成为鸽子的主人，而这群鸽子先前可是她主人那个嫉妒鬼邻居的。","This being just double their value, the man was very glad to close the bargain, and the nurse found herself in undisputed possession of the pigeons of her master’s envious neighbour."
"这群鸽子，在它们漫游的途中，和别的鸽子结伴而行，游历过海牙、洛维斯坦因和鹿特丹，就是为了寻求不同风味的小麦和大麻籽。","In the course of their wanderings, these pigeons with others visited the Hague, Loewestein, and Rotterdam, seeking variety, doubtless, in the flavour of their wheat or hempseed."
"是机缘巧合，更确切地说是上帝的意愿，让科尔内留斯·范巴尔莱偶然发现了这群鸽子，我们能发现一切事物都是上帝的安排。","Chance, or rather God, for we can see the hand of God in everything, had willed that Cornelius van Baerle should happen to hit upon one of these very pigeons."
"所以，如果一开始这个心怀嫉妒的坏蛋不离开多特，追随着他仇人的足迹来到海牙，然后又到戈尔肯或洛维斯坦因——这两个地方只隔着瓦尔河和马斯河的交汇口——范巴尔莱的信就会落到他的手里，而不是他奶妈手里。这样的话，那个可怜的犯人就会像罗马修鞋匠的渡鸦一样，白费时间和气力，咱们的笔下也不会勾绘出一系列千回百转的故事，就像五颜六色的挂毯上纷繁的色彩，除了漫长的、百无聊赖的日子，阴郁的如同夜行的深色斗篷一样，我们别无其他可描述。","Therefore, if the envious wretch had not left Dort to follow his rival to the Hague in the first place, and then to Gorcum or to Loewestein,—for the two places are separated only by the confluence of the Waal and the Meuse,—Van Baerle’s letter would have fallen into his hands and not the nurse’s: in which event the poor prisoner, like the raven of the Roman cobbler, would have thrown away his time, his trouble, and, instead of having to relate the series of exciting events which are about to flow from beneath our pen like the varied hues of a many coloured tapestry, we should have naught to describe but a weary waste of days, dull and melancholy and gloomy as night’s dark mantle."
"纸条就是这样到了奶妈的手里。","The note, as we have said, had reached Van Baerle’s nurse."
"纸条还传到另一个人手里。二月初的一个晚上了，夜幕刚刚降临，繁星闪烁，科尔内留斯听到角楼的楼道里的说话声，他浑身一激灵。","And also it came to pass, that one evening in the beginning of February, just when the stars were beginning to twinkle, Cornelius heard on the staircase of the little turret a voice which thrilled through him."
"他把手放在胸口，仔细听。","He put his hand on his heart, and listened."
"那是罗莎甜美悦耳的声音。","It was the sweet harmonious voice of Rosa."
"我们得承认，科尔内留斯当时并未惊得目瞪口呆，也没有乐得得意忘形，多亏了那只鸽子，翅膀下空空如也地回来，给他的信带来回音儿，给他带来了希望。他了解罗莎，如果她看到纸条，他一定会盼到他的爱人罗莎和他那三个心爱的球茎的消息的。","Let us confess it, Cornelius was not so stupefied with surprise, or so beyond himself with joy, as he would have been but for the pigeon, which, in answer to his letter, had brought back hope to him under her empty wing; and, knowing Rosa, he expected, if the note had ever reached her, to hear of her whom he loved, and also of his three darling bulbs."
"他站起身，身子朝门口倾着，又仔细地听。","He rose, listened once more, and bent forward towards the door."
"没错，这就是罗莎的口音，在海牙的时候，它是如此动听地敲打着他的心门。","Yes, they were indeed the accents which had fallen so sweetly on his heart at the Hague."
"罗莎从海牙来到了洛维斯坦因，还顺利地进了监狱——科尔内留斯不明白她是怎么做到的——现在的问题是，罗莎是不是也能幸运地来到作为犯人的他本人面前呢？","The question now was, whether Rosa, who had made the journey from the Hague to Loewestein, and who—Cornelius did not understand how—had succeeded even in penetrating into the prison, would also be fortunate enough in penetrating to the prisoner himself."
"科尔内留斯在内心里琢磨着这个问题，就在他设想着如空中楼阁般的种种美好，纠结于希望与失落之间时，他牢房门上的窗洞开了，罗莎笑魇如花，在她民族服饰的衬托下美艳动人——这五个月来的悲伤使她的双颊变得苍白，越发显得美丽了——她把她的小脸贴在窗子的铁栅上，对他说：","Whilst Cornelius, debating this point within himself, was building all sorts of castles in the air, and was struggling between hope and fear, the shutter of the grating in the door opened, and Rosa, beaming with joy, and beautiful in her pretty national costume—but still more beautiful from the grief which for the last five months had blanched her cheeks—pressed her little face against the wire grating of the window, saying to him,—"
"“啊，先生，先生！我来了！”","“Oh, sir, sir! here I am!”"
"科内尔留斯伸出胳膊，高兴地仰天叫了出来：","Cornelius stretched out his arms, and, looking to heaven, uttered a cry of joy,—"
"“啊，罗莎，罗莎！”","“Oh, Rosa, Rosa!”"
"“嘘！我们还是小声说话吧，我爸爸就在我后面。”罗莎说。","“Hush! let us speak low: my father follows on my heels,” said the girl."
"“你爸爸？”","“Your father?”"
"“是啊，他现在在楼梯底下的院子里接受地方长官的命令呢，他一会儿就会上来。”","“Yes, he is in the courtyard at the bottom of the staircase, receiving the instructions of the Governor; he will presently come up.”"
"“地方长官的命令？”","“The instructions of the Governor?”"
"“听我说，我长话短说。总督在离莱顿较远的地方有座乡间别墅，确切地说，就是一个大牛奶场，我姑妈，也就是他奶妈负责管理那儿。我一收到你的信，唉！我不识字，不过你管家念给我听的，一收到信，我就跑到我姑妈那儿，在那儿一直等着亲王来牛奶场。他来后，我就请他帮忙，允许我爸爸从海牙监狱看守长的职位调到洛维斯坦因监狱来当看守。亲王没有怀疑我的用意。他要是知道了，他不会答应我的请求的，不过看样子他不知道，所以他应允了。”","“Listen to me, I’ll try to tell you all in a few words.The Stadtholder has a country-house, one league distant from Leyden, properly speaking a kind of large dairy, and my aunt, who was his nurse, has the management of it.As soon as I received your letter, which, alas! I could not read myself, but which your housekeeper read to me, I hastened to my aunt; there I remained until the Prince should come to the dairy; and when he came, I asked him as a favour to allow my father to exchange his post at the prison of the Hague with the jailer of the fortress of Loewestein.The Prince could not have suspected my object; had he known it, he would have refused my request, but as it is he granted it.”"
"“所以你就来这儿了？”","“And so you are here?”"
"“你不是看见了嘛。”","“As you see.”"
"“那么，我就可以每天见到你了？”","“And thus I shall see you every day?”"
"“我会尽可能多地来看你。”","“As often as I can manage it.”"
"“哦，罗莎，美丽的罗莎，你是不是有点儿爱上我了？”","“Oh, Rosa, my beautiful Rosa, do you love me a little?”"
"“有点儿？”她说，“你倒不自以为是啊，科尔内留斯先生。”","“A little?” she said, “you make no great pretensions, Mynheer Cornelius.”"
"科尔内留斯温柔地朝她伸出他的双手，可是他们只能隔着栅栏碰碰指尖。","Cornelius tenderly stretched out his hands towards her, but they were only able to touch each other with the tips of their fingers through the wire grating."
"“我爸来了。”她说。","“Here is my father,” said she."
"罗莎猛地退离了门口，朝出现在楼梯口的老格里弗斯迎过去。","Rosa then abruptly drew back from the door, and ran to meet old Gryphus, who made his appearance at the top of the staircase."
"第十五章 带铁栏的小窗","Chapter 15 The Little Grated Window"
"格里弗斯身后跟着那只大狗。","Gryphus was followed by the mastiff."
"他带着这只狗在监狱里转悠，让狗熟悉一下犯人，以备不时之需。","The turnkey took the animal round the jail, so that, if needs be, he might recognize the prisoners."
"“爸爸，”罗莎说，“格劳休斯先生就是从这所监狱里逃出去的，这可是出了名的。您知道格劳休斯先生吧？”","“Father,” said Rosa, “here is the famous prison from which Mynheer Grotius escaped.You know Mynheer Grotius?”"
"“噢，知道，那个无赖格劳休斯，巴尔维特的一个朋友，我小时候亲眼看过巴尔维特被处决。啊！格劳休斯，他就是从这间牢房逃走的吧。我敢担保，我在这儿当差，没人会像他一样从这儿逃跑。”","“Oh, yes, that rogue Grotius, a friend of that villain Barneveldt, whom I saw executed when I was a child.Ah! so Grotius; and that’s the chamber from which he escaped.Well, I’ll answer for it that no one shall escape after him in my time.”"
"说着，他开了门，在黑暗中开始跟犯人说话。","And thus opening the door, he began in the dark to talk to the prisoner."
"狗呢，一边低吠，一边跑向犯人，嗅着犯人腿上的气息，仿佛在质问他有什么权利还活在这世上，因为它明明看见他和书记官、刽子手一起离开了监狱。","The dog, on his part, went up to the prisoner, and, growling, smelled about his legs just as though to ask him what right he had still to be alive, after having left the prison in the company of the Recorder and the executioner."
"但是美丽的罗莎把狗唤回了身边。","But the fair Rosa called him to her side."
"“我说，先生，”格里弗斯说着，举起了手中的灯，以把周围稍微照亮一点，“我就是你的新看守。我是看守长，这里所有的牢房都归我管。我不是恶人，不过你们要是不服管教的话，我可不是好糊弄的。”","“Well, my master,” said Gryphus, holding up his lantern to throw a little light around, “you see in me your new jailer.I am head turnkey, and have all the cells under my care.I am not vicious, but I’m not to be trifled with, as far as discipline goes.”"
"“亲爱的格里弗斯先生，我是很了解你的。”犯人说着，走进了灯照亮的光圈内。","“My good Master Gryphus, I know you perfectly well,” said the prisoner, approaching within the circle of light cast around by the lantern."
"“哟！是你啊，范巴尔莱先生。”格里弗斯说。“是你，呵，我得说，人和人的相遇总是有些出人意料。”","“Halloa! that’s you, Mynheer van Baerle,” said Gryphus.“That’s you; well, I declare, it’s astonishing how people do meet.”"
"“是啊，格里弗斯先生，看到您现在的胳膊好了，能提灯了，我真的挺高兴的。”","“Oh, yes; and it’s really a great pleasure to me, good Master Gryphus, to see that your arm is doing well, as you are able to hold your lantern with it.”"
"格里弗斯皱了皱眉。“我说吧，”他说，“人们在政治上总会犯错。亲王殿下赦免了你，要是换我，我准不会这么做。”","Gryphus knitted his brow.“Now, that’s just it,” he said, “people always make blunders in politics.His Highness has granted you your life; I’m sure I should never have done so.”"
"“别这么说。”科尔内留斯反问道，“为什么不呢？”","“Don’t say so,” replied Cornelius; “why not?”"
"“因为你就是那种还会搞阴谋诡计的人。你们这群有学问的人和魔鬼打交道。”","“Because you are the very man to conspire again.You learned people have dealings with the devil.”"
"“格里弗斯先生，您这是什么话。您是不满意我接您胳膊的方式呢，还是我找您收费了？”科尔内留斯大笑着说。","“Nonsense, Master Gryphus.Are you dissatisfied with the manner in which I have set your arm, or with the price that I asked you?” said Cornelius, laughing."
"“恰恰相反，”看守恶狠狠地说，“你接得太好了。这里面一定有妖术。六个星期后，我的胳膊就好使了，就像什么都没发生过一样，连布伊坦霍夫精通此道的医生都想让我胳膊重新折掉，他再按常规方式给我接上，并向我保证，我整整三个月都不能动它。","“On the contrary,” growled the jailer, “you have set it only too well.There is some witchcraft in this.After six weeks, I was able to use it as if nothing had happened, so much so, that the doctor of the Buytenhof, who knows his trade well, wanted to break it again, to set it in the regular way, and promised me that I should have my blessed three months for my money before I should be able to move it.”"
"“您不愿意那么做？”","“And you did not want that?”"
"“我说，‘不，只要我还能用那只胳膊画十字（格里弗斯是天主教徒），我就不怕魔鬼。’”","“I said, ‘Nay, as long as I can make the sign of the cross with that arm’ (Gryphus was a Roman Catholic), ‘I laugh at the devil.’”"
"“可是，格里弗斯先生，既然您不怕魔鬼，就更没理由怕有学问的人了。”","“But if you laugh at the devil, Master Gryphus, you ought with so much more reason to laugh at learned people.”"
"“啊，有学问的人，有学问的人！嗨，我情愿看守十个当兵的，也不愿看守一个有学问的。当兵的抽烟喝酒，会烂醉如泥。只要给他们白兰地或马斯酒，他们就温顺得跟小羊羔一样，可那些学者呢，喝酒抽烟、烂醉如泥——他们才不会呢。他们什么都不消耗，保持头脑清醒，这样他们就可以搞阴谋诡计。可我先要告诉你，你要搞什么阴谋可没那么容易。首先，你没有书，没有纸和那些耍鬼把戏的书。当初格劳休斯先生就是靠书逃走的。”","“Ah, learned people, learned people!Why, I would rather have to guard ten soldiers than one scholar.The soldiers smoke, guzzle, and get drunk; they are gentle as lambs if you only give them brandy or Moselle, but scholars, and drink, smoke, and fuddle—ah, yes, that’s altogether different.They keep sober, spend nothing, and have their heads always clear to make conspiracies.But I tell you, at the very outset, it won’t be such an easy matter for you to conspire.First of all, you will have no books, no paper, and no conjuring book.It’s books that helped Mynheer Grotius to get off.”"
"“我向你保证，格里弗斯先生，”范巴尔莱说，“就算之前我有过逃跑的想法，现在也彻底打消了念头。”","“I assure you, Master Gryphus,” replied Van Baerle, “that if I have entertained the idea of escaping, I most decidedly have it no longer.”"
"“那就好，那就好。”格里弗斯说，“你得机灵点儿，我也得小心提防你。不过，尽管如此，我还是得说殿下犯了大错。”","“Well, well,” said Gryphus, “just look sharp: that’s what I shall do also.But, for all that, I say his Highness has made a great mistake.”"
"“您是说没砍我脑袋？谢谢您了，格里弗斯先生。”","“Not to have cut off my head? thank you, Master Gryphus.”"
"“不是吗，你看看德维特兄弟现在多老实。”","“Just so, look whether the Mynheer de Witt don’t keep very quiet now.”"
"“格里弗斯先生，您这么说就太过火了。”范巴尔莱叫着，扭过头以掩饰自己的厌恶情绪。“您忘了这两个不幸的人当中，一个是我的朋友，另一个是我的教父。”","“That’s very shocking what you say now, Master Gryphus,” cried Van Baerle, turning away his head to conceal his disgust.“You forget that one of those unfortunate gentlemen was my friend, and the other my second father.”"
"“没错，可我还记得这两个人都是阴谋家。况且，我说这话也是出于基督教的仁爱。”","“Yes, but I also remember that the one, as well as the other, was a conspirator.And, moreover, I am speaking from Christian charity.”"
"“哦，是嘛！那就请您再跟我解释一下吧，亲爱的格里弗斯先生。我有些不明白。”","“Oh, indeed! explain that a little to me, my good Master Gryphus.I do not quite understand it.”"
"“行，如果你没从哈尔布吕克先生的断头台上下来的话——”","“Well, then, if you had remained on the block of Master Harbruck—”"
"“又怎样？”","“What?”"
"“你就不用再受苦了。但是，我也不瞒你了，我不会让你有好日子过的。”","“You would not suffer any longer; whereas, I will not disguise it from you, I shall lead you a sad life of it.”"
"“谢谢你的承诺，格里弗斯先生。”","“Thank you for the promise, Master Gryphus.”"
"当犯人对着老看守嘲讽地笑的时候，另一边的罗莎却报以明媚的笑容，顿时范巴尔莱的心里像吃了蜜一般，得到了抚慰。","And whilst the prisoner smiled ironically at the old jailer, Rosa, from the outside, answered by a bright smile, which carried sweet consolation to the heart of Van Baerle."
"格里弗斯朝窗口走去。","Gryphus stepped towards the window."
"天还没有全黑，透过灰蒙蒙的暮霭，尽管依稀难辨，但还是能看到广袤的地平线。","It was still light enough to see, although indistinctly, through the gray haze of the evening, the vast expanse of the horizon."
"“这儿的景色怎么样？”格里弗斯问。","“What view has one from here?” asked Gryphus."
"“呃，非常不错，美极了。”科尔内留斯说着，看了看罗莎，","“Why, a very fine and pleasant one,” said Cornelius, looking at Rosa."
"“是啊，是啊，景色太好太美了。”","“Yes, yes, too much of a view, too much.”"
"这时候，那两只鸽子看到这个陌生人，尤其是听到陌生人的声音，受了惊吓，仓惶地飞离它们的窝，消失在暮霭之中。","And at this moment the two pigeons, scared by the sight and especially by the voice of the stranger, left their nest, and disappeared, quite frightened in the evening mist."
"“哈！这是什么？”格里弗斯大声问道。","“Halloa! what’s this?” cried Gryphus."
"“我的鸽子。”科尔内留斯回答说。","“My pigeons,” answered Cornelius."
"“你的鸽子，”看守嚷嚷着，“你的鸽子！犯人还有属于自己的东西？”","“Your pigeons,” cried the jailer, “your pigeons! has a prisoner anything of his own?”"
"“怎么不可以？”科尔内留斯说，“鸽子是仁慈的上帝赐给我的礼物。”","“Why, then,” said Cornelius, “the pigeons which a merciful Father in Heaven has lent to me.”"
"“这么说，你已经违规了。”格里弗斯回答说，“鸽子！啊，年轻人啊年轻人！我就告诉你，最迟明天，你的鸽子就会成为我的盘中餐。”","“So, here we have a breach of the rules already,” replied Gryphus.“Pigeons! ah, young man, young man!I’ll tell you one thing, that before to-morrow is over, your pigeons will boil in my pot.”"
"“格里弗斯先生，您得先抓到它们。您不允许我拥有这些鸽子！我敢发誓，它们更不是您的！”","“First of all you should catch them, Master Gryphus.You won’t allow these pigeons to be mine!Well, I vow they are even less yours than mine.”"
"“我绝不会善罢甘休的。”看守低声咆哮着，“我一定会在二十四小时内拧断它们的脖子，你走着瞧。”","“Omittance is no quittance,” growled the jailer, “and I shall certainly wring their necks before twenty-four hours are over: you may be sure of that.”"
"格里弗斯一边许下如此恶毒的诺言，一边从窗子探出头去查看鸽子窝。这样范巴尔莱就有充足的时间跑到门口，握了握罗莎的手，罗莎轻声对他说：","Whilst giving utterance to this ill-natured promise, Gryphus put his head out of the window to examine the nest.This gave Van Baerle time to run to the door, and squeeze the hand of Rosa, who whispered to him,—"
"“今晚九点，我来找你。”","“At nine o’clock this evening.”"
"格里弗斯，一心想着第二天要抓到鸽子——他可是做出承诺了的——所以他压根没看到，也没听到这段小插曲。他关好窗后，搀着她女儿的胳膊离开了牢房，锁好门，上了门闩，去跟其他的犯人许同样的诺言去了。","Gryphus, quite taken up with the desire of catching the pigeons next day, as he had promised he would do, saw and heard nothing of this short interlude; and, after having closed the window, he took the arm of his daughter, left the cell, turned the key twice, drew the bolts, and went off to make the same kind promise to the other prisoners."
"他刚走，科尔内留斯就跑到门口听着他的脚步声，脚步声一消失，他就奔向窗口，彻底毁掉了鸽子窝。","He had scarcely withdrawn, when Cornelius went to the door to listen to the sound of his footsteps, and, as soon as they had died away, he ran to the window, and completely demolished the nest of the pigeons."
"他不愿意让鸽子任由恃强凌弱的看守摆布，情愿永远赶走这温柔的信使，他能重见罗莎，它们可是有功之臣。","Rather than expose them to the tender mercies of his bullying jailer, he drove away for ever those gentle messengers to whom he owed the happiness of having seen Rosa again."
"看守的视察、无情的恐吓，还有格里弗斯对犯人的刻薄——这点他可深有体会，将来的日子不会好过，可所有的这些都不能浇熄他的甜蜜思绪，尤其是因为罗莎的到来，他心头被唤醒的甜蜜希望。","This visit of the jailer, his brutal threats, and the gloomy prospect of the harshness with which, as he had before experienced, Gryphus watched his prisoners,—all this was unable to extinguish in Cornelius the sweet thoughts, and especially the sweet hope, which the presence of Rosa had reawakened in his heart."
"他迫切地等待着洛维斯坦因的钟声敲响了九下。","He waited eagerly to hear the clock of the tower of Loewestein strike nine."
"最后一下的钟声还在耳畔回荡，科尔内留斯就听到楼道传来轻轻的脚步声和美丽的弗里斯兰姑娘衣裙下摆的窸窣声，犯人热切地盯着牢门上的小铁窗，不一会儿铁窗就透出一丝光亮。","The last chime was still vibrating through the air, when Cornelius heard on the staircase the light step and the rustle of the flowing dress of the fair Frisian maid, and soon after a light appeared at the little grated window in the door, on which the prisoner fixed his earnest gaze."
"窗洞从外面打开了。","The shutter opened on the outside."
"“我来了。”罗莎一路跑上楼梯，还没喘过气来，说，“我来了。”","“Here I am,” said Rosa, out of breath from running up the stairs, “here I am.”"
"“啊！好罗莎！”","“Oh, my good Rosa.”"
"“你看见我高兴吗？”","“You are then glad to see me?”"
"“这还用问？可你是怎么设法到这里来的？说给我听听。”","“Can you ask?But how did you contrive to get here? tell me.”"
"“听我说。我爸爸每天一吃完晚饭就会打一会儿盹儿，喝了点杜松子酒，就有些迷迷糊糊的，我就让他躺下了。可千万别说出去，因为要不是他睡这一小时，我就不能每天晚上过来陪你聊天了。”","“Now listen to me.My father falls asleep every evening almost immediately after his supper; I then make him lie down, a little stupefied with his gin.Don’t say anything about it, because, thanks to this nap, I shall be able to come every evening and chat for an hour with you.”"
"“啊！谢谢你，罗莎，亲爱的罗莎。”","“Oh, I thank you, Rosa, dear Rosa.”"
"说着，科尔内留斯把脸凑近小窗口，可罗莎却躲开了。","Saying these words, Cornelius put his face so near the little window that Rosa withdrew hers."
"“我给你把球茎带来了。”","“I have brought back to you your bulbs.”"
"科尔内留斯高兴得心都快蹦出来了。之前他一直没敢问罗莎怎么处置的他托付给她的宝贝。","Cornelius’s heart leaped with joy.He had not yet dared to ask Rosa what she had done with the precious treasure which he had intrusted to her."
"“啊，这么说你把它们保存起来了？”　","“Oh, you have preserved them, then?”"
"“你不是把它们当作你的心爱之物交给我的吗？”","“Did you not give them to me as a thing which was dear to you?”"
"“是啊，可是既然我给了你，我以为它们就是你的了。”","“Yes, but as I have given them to you, it seems to me that they belong to you.”"
"“你要是离开人世了，它们就是我的，可幸运的是，你现在还活着。我在内心深处为亲王殿下祈神赐福！如果上帝赐予他我为他祈求的所有幸福的话，威廉亲王无疑是世界上最幸福的人。每当我看到你教父科尔内留斯的《圣经》，我就下决心，一定要把球茎送还给你，只不过我不知道该怎么做。尽管如此，你的管家把信带给我的时候，我就已经想好了怎么去找总督，请求他任命我的爸爸为洛维斯坦因的看守。唉，我们在一块儿哭得多伤心啊！但是你的信进一步坚定了我的决心。于是我就去了莱顿，剩下的故事你都知道了。”","“They would have belonged to me after your death, but, fortunately, you are alive now.Oh how I blessed his Highness in my heart!If God grants to him all the happiness that I have wished him, certainly Prince William will be the happiest man on earth.When I looked at the Bible of your godfather Cornelius, I was resolved to bring back to you your bulbs, only I did not know how to accomplish it.I had, however, already formed the plan of going to the Stadtholder, to ask from him for my father the appointment of jailer of Loewestein, when your housekeeper brought me your letter.Oh, how we wept together!But your letter only confirmed me the more in my resolution.I then left for Leyden, and the rest you know.”"
"“什么？亲爱的罗莎，你是说你在收到我的信之前，就想过要来找我吗？”","“What, my dear Rosa, you thought, even before receiving my letter, of coming to meet me again?”"
"“想过！”罗莎顾不上害羞，直白地表达着自己的爱，说，“我就没想过别的。”","“If I thought of it,” said Rosa, allowing her love to get the better of her bashfulness, “I thought of nothing else.”"
"说这些话的时候，罗莎看起来格外的美丽，科尔内留斯第二次将自己的前额和嘴唇贴到铁窗上，我们一定会猜测，他没有邪念，只是想感谢这位年轻的姑娘。","And, saying these words, Rosa looked so exceedingly pretty, that for the second time Cornelius placed his forehead and lips against the wire grating; of course, we must presume with the laudable desire to thank the young lady."
"可是罗莎又跟上次一样，退缩了。","Rosa, however, drew back as before."
"“事实上，”她说，带着某种每一个年轻女孩心中都会有的媚态，“我不识字，我一直觉得挺难过的，但是最难过的还是你的管家给我送来你的信的时候。我手里拿着信，这信跟别的人都能说话，可是碰到我这傻傻的可怜虫就变成哑巴了。”","“In truth,” she said, with that coquetry which somehow or other is in the heart of every young girl, “I have often been sorry that I am not able to read, but never so much so as when your housekeeper brought me your letter.I kept the paper in my hands, which spoke to other people, and which was dumb to poor stupid me.”"
"“这么说，你经常因为不识字而遗憾难过啊。”科尔内留斯说。“我想知道通常在什么情况下。”","“So you have often regretted not being able to read,” said Cornelius.“I should just like to know on what occasions.”"
"“真的，”她笑着说，“在读所有写给我的信的时候。”","“Troth,” she said, laughing, “to read all the letters which were written to me.”"
"“啊，罗莎，你收过很多信？”","“Oh, you received letters, Rosa?”"
"“好几百封呢。”","“By hundreds.”"
"“可都是谁写给你的呢？”","“But who wrote to you?”"
"“谁写给我的？首先，所有从布伊坦霍夫经过的学生，阅兵行进的军官，所有的职员，甚至还有从我的小窗户里瞥见我的商人。”","“Who! why, in the first place, all the students who passed over the Buytenhof, all the officers who went to parade, all the clerks, and even the merchants who saw me at my little window.”"
"“亲爱的罗莎，所有的这些信你都怎么处理的呢？”","“And what did you do with all these notes, my dear Rosa?”"
"“起先，”她回答，“我会让朋友读给我听，倒是挺有意思，但是从某一刻起，我发现听这些胡言乱语有什么意义呢？——从某一刻起，我就把它们烧了。”","“Formerly,” she answered, “I got some friend to read them to me, which was capital fun, but since a certain time—well, what use is it to attend to all this nonsense?—since a certain time I have burnt them.”"
"“从某一刻起！”科尔内留斯叫道，眼神里充满爱意与欢乐。","“Since a certain time!” exclaimed Cornelius, with a look beaming with love and joy."
"罗莎涨红了脸，垂下了眼睑。甜蜜的慌乱中，她没注意到科尔内留斯的嘴唇正凑过来，唉！他的嘴唇又只碰到那冰冷的铁窗。可是，尽管有这么一个障碍物，他的嘴唇还是把他那温柔一吻的炽热气息传递到姑娘的嘴唇上。","Rosa cast down her eyes, blushing.In her sweet confusion, she did not observe the lips of Cornelius, which, alas! only met the cold wire-grating.Yet, in spite of this obstacle, they communicated to the lips of the young girl the glowing breath of the most tender kiss."
"这份温柔突然蔓延开来，罗莎措手不及，脸色变得苍白——或许比他要被处决的那天还要苍白。她悲伤地啜泣了一声，闭上了双眼，逃开了，心怦怦直跳，难以平息。","At this sudden outburst of tenderness, Rosa grew very pale,—perhaps paler than she had been on the day of the execution.She uttered a plaintive sob, closed her fine eyes, and fled, trying in vain to still the beating of her heart."
"这样科尔内留斯又是孤零零的一个人了。","And thus Cornelius was again alone."
"罗莎仓皇地离开了，把要将三个黑郁金香球茎还给科尔内留斯的事忘得一干二净。","Rosa had fled so precipitately, that she completely forgot to return to Cornelius the three bulbs of the Black Tulip."
"第十六章 老师与学生","Chapter 16 Master and Pupil"
"读者或许已经看出来了，这个令人尊敬的格里弗斯先生和他的女儿截然相反，对科尔内留斯·德维特的教子没有一点好感。","The worthy Master Gryphus, as the reader may have seen, was far from sharing the kindly feeling of his daughter for the godson of Cornelius de Witt."
"洛维斯坦因只关了五个犯人，对资历较老的人来说，监狱看守的工作并不繁重，反而算得上是一个闲差事。","There being only five prisoners at Loewestein, the post of turnkey was not a very onerous one, but rather a sort of sinecure, given after a long period of service."
"可这位值得敬重的监狱看守对工作是满腔的热情，运用他的一切想象力，无限放大自己岗位的重要性。在他眼里，科尔内留斯已经被放大成要犯。所以他认为科尔内留斯是他所有犯人中最危险的一个。他关注着他的一举一动，跟他说话时总是没有好脸色，以此来惩罚他对像总督那样宅心仁厚的亲王的大逆不道。","But the worthy jailer, in his zeal, had magnified with all the power of his imagination the importance of his office.To him Cornelius had swelled to the gigantic proportions of a criminal of the first order.He looked upon him, therefore, as the most dangerous of all his prisoners.He watched all his steps, and always spoke to him with an angry countenance; punishing him for what he called his dreadful rebellion against such a clement prince as the Stadtholder."
"他一天要进范巴尔莱的牢房三次，希望能抓到他违规。可科尔内留斯早就不写信了，因为他要写信的人就在他身边。甚至可以说，即使科尔内留斯完全获得了自由，可以想去哪里就去哪里，有罗莎和球茎的监狱，对他来说也比世界上的任何一个没有罗莎和球茎的居所要强。","Three times a day he entered Van Baerle’s cell, expecting to find him trespassing; but Cornelius had ceased to correspond, since his correspondent was at hand.It is even probable that, if Cornelius had obtained his full liberty, with permission to go wherever he liked, the prison, with Rosa and his bulbs, would have appeared to him preferable to any other habitation in the world without Rosa and his bulbs."
"事实上，罗莎许诺每晚来看他，从第一晚上起，她从未食言。","Rosa, in fact, had promised to come and see him every evening, and from the first evening she had kept her word."
"第二天晚上，她跟头天晚上一样神神秘秘、小心翼翼地上楼来。只不过这次她暗下决心，决不把脸凑到铁窗跟前。然而，为了一开始就能吸引范巴尔莱的注意力，投入到严肃认真的谈话，她想隔着铁窗递给他那三个球茎，球茎依然用那张纸包裹着。","On the following evening she went up as before, with the same mysteriousness and the same precaution.Only she had this time resolved within herself not to approach too near the grating.In order, however, to engage Van Baerle in a conversation from the very first which would seriously occupy his attention, she tendered to him through the grating the three bulbs, which were still wrapped up in the same paper."
"可是让罗莎吃惊的是，范巴尔莱用指尖推开了她白皙的手。","But to the great astonishment of Rosa, Van Baerle pushed back her white hand with the tips of his fingers."
"这个年轻人一直在考虑这件事。","The young man had been considering about the matter."
"“听我说，”他说，“我觉得我们把家当都放到一艘船上，风险太大。你想想，亲爱的罗莎，我们是在干一件目前看来不可能完成的事业，也就是要让黑郁金香开花。因此，我们要采取一切可能的防备措施，这样即使失败了，我们也没什么好责备自己的。现在我就跟你说说为我们设计的方案。”","“Listen to me,” he said.“I think we should risk too much by embarking our whole fortune in one ship.Only think, my dear Rosa, that the question is to carry out an enterprise which until now has been considered impossible, namely, that of making the great black tulip flower.Let us, therefore, take every possible precaution, so that in case of a failure we may not have anything to reproach ourselves with.I will now tell you the way I have traced out for us.”"
"罗莎对他要说的话是洗耳恭听，可更多的是因为这个不幸的郁金香迷一再强调此事的重要性，而不是出于她自己对此事的兴趣。","Rosa was all attention to what he would say, much more on account of the importance which the unfortunate tulip-fancier attached to it, than that she felt interested in the matter herself."
"“罗莎，我会跟你解释的。”他说，“我敢说这座监狱里一定会有个小花园，或者庭院什么的，要不，一块平地总会有吧。”","“I will explain to you, Rosa,” he said.“I dare say you have in this fortress a small garden, or some courtyard, or, if not that, at least some terrace.”"
"“我们有个不错的花园。”罗莎说，“在瓦尔河边，里面全是苍天大树。”","“We have a very fine garden,” said Rosa, “it runs along the edge of the Waal, and is full of fine old trees.”"
"“你能帮我从花园里取点土壤来让我看看吗？”","“Could you bring me some soil from the garden, that I may judge?”"
"“我明天就去。”","“I will do so to-morrow.”"
"“取点向阳处的土壤，再取点背阴处的，这样我就能判断出干燥和潮湿两种状态下土壤的特性了。”","“Take some from a sunny spot, and some from a shady, so that I may judge of its properties in a dry and in a moist state.”"
"“你放心好了。”","“Be assured I shall.”"
"“选好土，必要的话，我们改良一下土壤，然后咱们就把三个球茎分了。你拿去一个，我会告诉你哪天把它种到我选的土壤里。如果你按我的指导照看它，它一定会开花的。”","“After having chosen the soil, and, if it be necessary, modified it, we will divide our three bulbs; you will take one and plant it, on the day that I will tell you, in the soil chosen by me.It is sure to flower, if you tend it according to my directions.”"
"“我会片刻不离地守着它。”","“I will not lose sight of it for a minute.”"
"“你再给我一个，我就把它种在牢房里，以打发不能见到你时漫长无聊的时光。我跟你说，这个几乎没戏，我事先就把这个不幸的球茎看作是我自私的牺牲品。不管怎样，我这里总能见到点阳光。此外，我会利用一切人为条件，甚至包括我烟斗的热气和烟灰，最后，我们，或者不如说你，把第三个球茎保存好，万一我们前两个试验失败了，还有最后的资源。这样的话，亲爱的罗莎，咱们赢得那十万基尔德做你的嫁妆就是指日可待的了。看着我们的事业成功，享受那莫大的快乐是多么美好啊！”","“You will give me another, which I will try to grow here in my cell, and which will help me to beguile those long weary hours when I cannot see you.I confess to you I have very little hope for the latter one, and I look beforehand on this unfortunate bulb as sacrificed to my selfishness.However, the sun sometimes visits me.I will, besides, try to convert everything into an artificial help, even the heat and the ashes of my pipe, and lastly, we, or rather you, will keep in reserve the third sucker as our last resource, in case our first two experiments should prove a failure.In this manner, my dear Rosa, it is impossible that we should not succeed in gaining the hundred thousand guilders for your marriage portion; and how dearly shall we enjoy that supreme happiness of seeing our work brought to a successful issue!”"
"“我都知道了。”罗莎说，“我明天就把土给你带来，你替咱们的球茎选选看。不过你种球茎的土，我得分几次给你带来，我一次拿不了那么多。”","“I know it all now,” said Rosa.“I will bring you the soil to-morrow, and you will choose it for your bulb and for mine.As to that in which yours is to grow, I shall have several journeys to convey it to you, as I cannot bring much at a time.”"
"“亲爱的罗莎，这个不用着急，至少还要一个月才能种呢。所以，你看咱们还有的是时间。我只希望，你在培育你的球茎时，能够谨遵我的嘱咐。”","“There is no hurry for it, dear Rosa; our tulips need not be put into the ground for a month at least.So you see we have plenty of time before us.Only I hope that, in planting your bulb, you will strictly follow all my instructions.”"
"“我答应你。”","“I promise you I will.”"
"“一旦种下了球茎，你要向我汇报一切跟球茎的培育有关的情况，比如天气变化、过道上或者花坛上的脚印。晚上你要留心听听花园里有没有猫来捣蛋。在多特的时候，就有几只惹麻烦的猫把我的两个花坛整得一片狼藉。”","“And when you have once planted it, you will communicate to me all the circumstances which may interest our nursling; such as change of weather, footprints on the walks, or footprints in the borders.You will listen at night whether our garden is not resorted to by cats.A couple of those untoward animals laid waste two of my borders at Dort.”"
"“我一定留心听。”","“I will listen.”"
"“月夜里，你看过你的花园吗，我亲爱的孩子？”","“On moonlight nights have you ever looked at your garden, my dear child?”"
"“我卧房的窗户正对着它。”","“The window of my sleeping-room overlooks it.”"
"“那就好，有月亮的晚上，你要看看有没有耗子从墙洞里出来。耗子什么都咬，最可怕。我曾听过一个不幸的郁金香培植者痛心疾首地抱怨，当初诺亚为什么让一群耗子上了船。”","“Well, on moonlight nights you will observe whether any rats come out from the holes in the wall.The rats are most mischievous by their gnawing everything; and I have heard unfortunate tulip-growers complain most bitterly of Noah for having put a couple of rats in the ark.”"
"“我会注意的，要是有猫或耗子——”","“I will observe, and if there are cats or rats—”"
"“你就告诉我，——这就对了。还有，就是，”范巴尔莱被监禁以来，变得多疑了，继续说道，“还有一种动物比猫和耗子还要可怕。”","“You will apprise me of it,—that’s right.And, moreover,” Van Baerle, having become mistrustful in his captivity, continued, “there is an animal much more to be feared than even the cat or the rat.”"
"“什么动物？”","“What animal?”"
"“人。你明白吗，亲爱的罗莎，有人会为了一个基尔德，为这么一点钱甘愿冒坐牢的危险，所以有人去偷值十万基尔德的郁金香的可能性就更大了。”","“Man.You comprehend, my dear Rosa, a man may steal a guilder, and risk the prison for such a trifle, and, consequently, it is much more likely that some one might steal a hundred thousand guilders.”"
"“可除了我没人能进花园啊。”","“No one ever enters the garden but myself.”"
"“那就好，谢谢你，亲爱的罗莎！我生活中所有的快乐都来源于你。”","“Thank you, thank you, my dear Rosa.All the joy of my life has still to come from you.”"
"范巴尔莱的嘴唇带着与头天一样的激情凑近了铁窗，可分手的时间到了，罗莎缩回了头，伸出了她的手。","And as the lips of Van Baerle approached the grating with the same ardor as the day before, and as, moreover, the hour for retiring had struck, Rosa drew back her head, and stretched out her hand."
"这位风情万种的少女最为自豪的就是她的纤手，现在她的手里握着球茎。","In this pretty little hand, of which the coquettish damsel was particularly proud, was the bulb."
"科尔内留斯无限温柔地吻了吻她的指尖。他这么做到底是因为这只手里有一个大黑郁金香球茎，还是因为这是罗莎的手呢？这点我们暂且留给比我们更聪明的读者们来决定吧。","Cornelius kissed most tenderly the tips of her fingers.Did he do so because the hand kept one of the bulbs of the great black tulip, or because this hand was Rosa’s?We shall leave this point to the decision of wiser heads than ours."
"罗莎拿回了另外两个球茎，把它们紧贴在胸口。","Rosa withdrew with the other two suckers, pressing them to her heart."
"她把它们紧贴在胸口是因为这是大黑郁金香的球茎呢，还是因为这球茎是科尔内留斯给她的呢？","Did she press them to her heart because they were the bulbs of the great black tulip, or because she had them from Cornelius?"
"我们相信，这一点比刚才那点更容易判断。","This point, we believe, might be more readily decided than the other."
"不管怎样，从那一刻起，犯人的生活变得甜蜜，并且重新荡漾起生趣来。","However that may have been, from that moment life became sweet, and again full of interest to the prisoner."
"我们前面看到，罗莎已经还给他一个球茎。","Rosa, as we have seen, had returned to him one of the suckers."
"每个晚上，她都会一把一把地给他带些土来，那土可是从花园里他认为土质最好的地方挖过来的，事实上，那土的确很不错。","Every evening she brought to him, handful by handful, a quantity of soil from that part of the garden which he had found to be the best, and which, indeed, was excellent."
"科尔内留斯很有技巧地把一个大水罐摔破，当花盆用。他给花盆装了一半的土，然后就在从花园弄来的土里混上了少量的干燥河泥，这下土壤就很棒了。","A large jug, which Cornelius had skilfully broken, did service as a flower-pot.He half filled it, and mixed the earth of the garden with a small portion of dried river mud, a mixture which formed an excellent soil."
"于是，他于四月初在那个罐子里种下了他的第一个球茎。","Then, at the beginning of April, he planted his first sucker in that jug."
"罗莎每天都来陪科尔内留斯聊天，一天不落。","Not a day passed on which Rosa did not come to have her chat with Cornelius."
"关于郁金香的培植，罗莎在学习了解这门艺术的一切神秘之处，这也成了他们的主要话题。可是这个话题再怎么有趣，人们总有不谈郁金香的时候。","The tulips, concerning whose cultivation Rosa was taught all the mysteries of the art, formed the principal topic of the conversation; but, interesting as the subject was, people cannot always talk about tulips."
"因此他们也开始谈点别的，让这个郁金香迷吃惊的是，他发现他们的话题范围是如此之广，无所不包。","They therefore began to chat also about other things, and the tulip-fancier found out to his great astonishment what a vast range of subjects a conversation may comprise."
"只不过罗莎养成了习惯，始终把她漂亮的小脸保持在离铁窗六英寸的距离，可能是因为她对自己也不太放心吧。","Only Rosa had made it a habit to keep her pretty face invariably six inches distant from the grating, having perhaps become distrustful of herself."
"有一件事，科尔内留斯对它的担心不亚于对他的球茎——他也经常谈到此话题——就是罗莎对她父亲的依赖。","There was one thing especially which gave Cornelius almost as much anxiety as his bulbs—a subject to which he always returned—the dependence of Rosa on her father."
"事实上，范巴尔莱的快乐取决于这个人的一时兴致。或许有一天，他觉得洛维斯坦因的生活乏味，或者这地方的空气不好，抑或是杜松子酒不好，要离开这座监狱，还要带着他的女儿一起离开，这时科尔内留斯和罗莎就又得分开了。","Indeed, Van Baerle’s happiness depended on the whim of this man.He might one day find Loewestein dull, or the air of the place unhealthy, or the gin bad, and leave the fortress, and take his daughter with him, when Cornelius and Rosa would again be separated."
"“那时候就是有传信鸽又有什么用呢？”科尔内留斯对罗莎说，“我的好姑娘，你既看不了我写给你的信，也不能把你心里的想法回信给我。”","“Of what use would the carrier pigeons then be?” said Cornelius to Rosa, “as you, my dear girl, would not be able to read what I should write to you, nor to write to me your thoughts in return.”"
"“这样吧，”罗莎说，其实内心里她和科尔内留斯一样害怕分离，“我们每个晚上有一个小时，我们就好好利用这一个小时吧。”","“Well,” answered Rosa, who in her heart was as much afraid of a separation as Cornelius himself, “we have one hour every evening, let us make good use of it.”"
"“我没觉得咱们没好好利用啊。”","“I don’t think we make such a bad use of it as it is.”"
"“那咱们就更好地利用这段时间，”罗莎笑着说，“教我认字和写字。相信我，我一定会尽力的，不让你的心血白费，这样我们永远都不会分开了，除非是我们自己愿意。”","“Let us employ it even better,” said Rosa, smiling.“Teach me to read and write.I shall make the best of your lessons, believe me; and, in this way, we shall never be separated any more, except by our own will.”"
"“啊！那么咱们就可以永远在一起了。”科尔内留斯说。","“Oh, then, we have an eternity before us,” said Cornelius."
"罗莎微笑着，轻轻地耸了耸肩。","Rosa smiled, and quietly shrugged her shoulders."
"“你要一辈子呆在监狱吗？”她说，“亲王赦免了你的死罪，他难道不会给你自由吗？难道那时候你不会重获财产，又成为有钱人吗？当你乘着自己的马车或者骑着自己的马的时候，你还会去瞟一眼可怜的罗莎吗？我不过是名监狱看守的女儿，比刽子手强不了多少。”","“Will you remain for ever in prison?” she said, “and after having granted you your life, will not his Highness also grant you your liberty?And will you not then recover your fortune, and be a rich man, and then, when you are driving in your own coach, riding your own horse, will you still look at poor Rosa, the daughter of a jailer, scarcely better than a hangman?”"
"科尔内留斯本想反驳她，他一定会全心全意地、用一个充满爱的灵魂拥有的全部真诚来反驳她。","Cornelius tried to contradict her, and certainly he would have done so with all his heart, and with all the sincerity of a soul full of love."
"可她微笑着打断了他，问：“你的郁金香怎样了？”","She, however, smilingly interrupted him, saying, “How is your tulip going on?”"
"跟科尔内留斯谈论他的郁金香是罗莎让他忘记一切，甚至是罗莎本人的有效方法。","To speak to Cornelius of his tulip was an expedient resorted to by her to make him forget everything, even Rosa herself."
"“还不错，”他说，“外皮正在变黑，开始发芽了，球茎的经脉在膨胀，再过八天，或许不用八天，我们就能看到冒出来的芽孢了。你的呢，罗莎？”","“Very well, indeed,” he said, “the coat is growing black, the sprouting has commenced, the veins of the bulb are swelling, in eight days hence, and perhaps sooner, we may distinguish the first buds of the leaves protruding.And yours Rosa?”"
"“我啊，按照你的吩咐，我做了不少事呢。”","“Oh, I have done things on a large scale, and according to your directions.”"
"“那现在就说给我听听，罗莎，说说你都做了什么。”科尔内留斯说，他对郁金香的焦灼渴望充满了柔情，就像最近对她表现出来的一样。","“Now, let me hear, Rosa, what you have done,” said Cornelius, with as tender an anxiety as he had lately shown to herself."
"“好吧，”她微笑着说，在她内心深处，她情不自禁地想去辨别这名犯人对她和郁金香的双重之爱，“我做了不少事。按照你跟我说的，我在一片空地里拾掇了一个花坛，远离树木和墙，土壤里含了少许沙，不干燥，比较湿润，没有一块儿石子儿或鹅卵石。”","“Well,” she said, smiling, for in her own heart she could not help studying this double love of the prisoner for herself and for the black tulip, “I have done things on a large scale; I have prepared a bed as you described it to me, on a clear spot, far from trees and walls, in a soil slightly mixed with sand, rather moist than dry without a fragment of stone or pebble.”"
"“干得不错，罗莎，干得很好。”","“Well done, Rosa, well done.”"
"“我现在就等着你的吩咐，你叫我哪天把球茎种下去，我就种下去，你知道，我一定得比你缓一步，因为我有一切有利条件，空气流通，阳光充足，土壤里还有丰沛的水分。”","“I am now only waiting for your further orders to put in the bulb, you know that I must be behindhand with you, as I have in my favour all the chances of good air, of the sun, and abundance of moisture.”"
"“没错，完全正确，”科尔内留斯高兴地拍着手，大声说，“罗莎，你可真是个好学生，你一定能赢得十万基尔德的。”","“All true, all true,” exclaimed Cornelius, clapping his hands with joy, “you are a good pupil, Rosa, and you are sure to gain your hundred thousand guilders.”"
"“别忘了，”罗莎笑着说，“既然你叫我学生，你的学生除了郁金香培植还有别的东西要学呢。”","“Don’t forget,” said Rosa, smiling, “that your pupil, as you call me, has still other things to learn besides the cultivation of tulips.”"
"“是啊，是啊，罗莎，我跟你一样急切，你是应该学会识字。”","“Yes, yes, and I am as anxious as you are, Rosa, that you should learn to read.”"
"“那我们什么时候开始呢？”","“When shall we begin?”"
"“马上。”","“At once.”"
"“不，明天吧。”","“No, to-morrow.”"
"“为什么是明天？”","“Why to-morrow?”"
"“因为今天一个小时已经到了，我得走了。”","“Because to-day our hour is expired, and I must leave you.”"
"“就到时间啦？可我们该读什么呢？”","“Already?But what shall we read?”"
"“噢，”罗莎说，“我有一本书——一本我希望能给我们带来好运的书。”","“Oh,” said Rosa, “I have a book,—a book which I hope will bring us luck.”"
"“那明天见了。”","“To-morrow, then.”"
"“好的，明天见。”","“Yes, to-morrow.”"
"第二天晚上，罗莎拿着科尔内留斯·德维特的《圣经》来了。","On the following evening Rosa returned with the Bible of Cornelius de Witt."
"第十七章 第一个球茎","Chapter 17 The First Bulb"
"我们前面说到，第二天晚上，罗莎拿着科尔内留斯·德维特的《圣经》来了。","On the following evening, as we have said, Rosa returned with the Bible of Cornelius de Witt."
"于是，在老师与学生之间上演了动人的一幕，相信小说家们都很乐意描写这样迷人的场景。","Then began between the master and the pupil one of those charming scenes which are the delight of the novelist who has to describe them."
"两位恋人只能通过唯一的铁窗交流，虽然窗洞让他们很容易看清彼此的脸，可是要一起看书，那就太高了。","The grated window, the only opening through which the two lovers were able to communicate, was too high for conveniently reading a book, although it had been quite convenient for them to read each other’s faces."
"因此罗莎只能把书展开贴在铁栅栏上，右手拿灯，举过书顶，不过科尔内留斯忽然有个好主意——把灯挂在栅栏上，好让罗莎休息一会儿。这样罗莎就可以用手指着字母和音节，拼读给科尔内留斯听，而科尔内留斯则用麦秆穿过铁栅栏，指着那字母给他专心的学生看。","Rosa therefore had to press the open book against the grating edgewise, holding above it in her right hand the lamp, but Cornelius hit upon the lucky idea of fixing it to the bars, so as to afford her a little rest.Rosa was then enabled to follow with her finger the letters and syllables, which she was to spell for Cornelius, who with a straw pointed out the letters to his attentive pupil through the holes of the grating."
"灯光映衬着罗莎细腻的皮肤，湛蓝的眼睛，金色锦缎头饰下的金色长发，由于她抬着手，血往下流，白皙的皮肤下透着呈浅红色的静脉，在灯光下格外惹眼，展示着生命的流动。","The light of the lamp illuminated the rich complexion of Rosa, her blue liquid eyes, and her golden hair under her head-dress of gold brocade, with her fingers held up, and showing in the blood, as it flowed downwards in the veins that pale pink hue which shines before the light owing to the living transparency of the flesh tint."
"罗莎的理解力在科尔内留斯的循循善诱下突飞猛进，即使再大的困难，这两颗爱人的心总能齐心协力地将它化解开来。","Rosa’s intellect rapidly developed itself under the animating influence of Cornelius, and when the difficulties seemed too arduous, the sympathy of two loving hearts seemed to smooth them away."
"而且罗莎回到房间后，总会在一个人的时候重温她的功课，还有上课时的所有快乐。","And Rosa, after having returned to her room, repeated in her solitude the reading lessons, and at the same time recalled all the delight which she had felt whilst receiving them."
"一个晚上，她比平时晚来了半个小时。这很不寻常，这使科尔内留斯忍不住一见面就询问原因。","One evening she came half an hour later than usual.This was too extraordinary an instance not to call forth at once Cornelius’s inquiries after its cause."
"“啊！别生我的气，”她说，“这不是我的错。我爸爸碰见从前认识的一个人，那人以前经常去海牙看他，还要我爸爸让他参观一下监狱。　那人倒不错，喜欢喝酒，讲些奇闻轶事，而且，花起钱来也很大方，总是随时都要作东请客的样子。”","“Oh! do not be angry with me,” she said, “it is not my fault.My father has renewed an acquaintance with an old crony who used to visit him at the Hague, and to ask him to let him see the prison.He is a good sort of fellow, fond of his bottle, tells funny stories, and moreover is very free with his money, so as always to be ready to stand a treat.”"
"“别的方面你对他不了解吗？”科尔内留斯吃惊地问。","“You don’t know anything further of him?” asked Cornelius, surprised."
"“不了解，”她回答，“我爸爸跟这人要好也不过两个星期，那人来得也殷勤。”","“No,” she answered; “it’s only for about a fortnight that my father has taken such a fancy to this friend who is so assiduous in visiting him.”"
"“啊，这样啊！”科尔内留斯不安地摇摇头说，在他看来，任何一件新鲜事都预示着灾难，“这人很可能是间谍，派到监狱里监视犯人和看守的间谍。”","“Ah, so,” said Cornelius, shaking his head uneasily as every new incident seemed to him to forebode some catastrophe; “very likely some spy, one of those who are sent into jails to watch both prisoners and their keepers.”"
"“我不这么认为。”罗莎笑着说，“即使那个可敬的人是来暗中监视别人的，他要监视的也一定不会是我爸爸。”","“I don’t believe that,” said Rosa, smiling; “if that worthy person is spying after any one, it is certainly not after my father.”"
"“那会是监视谁？”","“After whom, then?”"
"“也许是我。”","“Me, for instance.”"
"“你？”","“You?”"
"“不可以吗？”罗莎笑着说。","“Why not?” said Rosa, smiling."
"“啊，说得对。”科尔内留斯说着叹了口气，“你的追求者不会总是竹篮打水一场空，这人也许会成为你的丈夫。”","“Ah, that’s true,” Cornelius observed, with a sigh.“You will not always have suitors in vain; this man may become your husband.”"
"“我不否认。”","“I don’t say anything to the contrary.”"
"“是什么让你有如此乐观的想法？”","“What cause have you to entertain such a happy prospect?”"
"“应该是担心才对，科尔内留斯先生。”","“Rather say, this fear, Mynheer Cornelius.”"
"“谢谢，罗莎，你说得对，你这么担心是因为什么呢？”","“Thank you, Rosa, you are right; well, I will say then, this fear?”"
"“我只有一个理由——”","“I have only this reason—”"
"“快告诉我，我很想听听。”","“Tell me, I am anxious to hear.”"
"“这人在来布伊坦霍夫监狱之前，就去过海牙好几次。现在我回想，正好是你被关在那儿的时候。我离开了，他也离开了。我来这儿，他也跟着来了。在海牙时，他借口说是要见你。”","“This man came several times before to the Buytenhof, at the Hague.I remember now, it was just about the time when you were confined there.When I left, he left too; when I came here, he came after me.At the Hague his pretext was that he wanted to see you.”"
"“见我？”","“See me?”"
"“对啊，眼下看来，那完全是个借口，现在你又成了我爸爸的犯人，他完全还可以用这个理由，可他压根都没提过你。恰恰相反，我昨天还听见他跟我爸爸说，他不认识你。”","“Yes, it must have undoubtedly been only a pretext for now, when he could plead the same reason, as you are my father’s prisoner again, he does not care any longer for you; quite the contrary,—I heard him say to my father only yesterday that he did not know you.”"
"“继续说，罗莎，求你了，我也许能猜到这人是谁，他到底想要什么。”","“Go on, Rosa, pray do, that I may guess who that man is, and what he wants.”"
"“科尔内留斯先生，你确定没有一个朋友会来看你吗？”","“Are you quite sure, Mynheer Cornelius, that none of your friends can interest himself for you?”"
"“罗莎，我没有朋友。我只有一个奶妈，你们都互相认识的。唉，可怜的苏格！她会亲自来的，用不着绕圈子。她会直接对你父亲或对你说：‘先生，或者小姐行行好，我的孩子被关在这儿。你看我多伤心啊，你就让我见见他吧，就一个钟头，我有生之年会为你祷告的。’没有，没有，”科尔内留斯继续说，“除了我那可怜的苏格，在这世上我没有朋友。”","“I have no friends, Rosa; I have only my old nurse, whom you know, and who knows you.Alas, poor Sue! she would come herself, and use no roundabout ways.She would at once say to your father, or to you, ‘My good sir, or my good miss, my child is here; see how grieved I am; let me see him only for one hour, and I’ll pray for you as long as I live.’No, no,” continued Cornelius; “with the exception of my poor old Sue, I have no friends in this world.”"
"“这么说我之前的想法是对的，越想越觉得是，特别是昨晚太阳落山前，我正在拾掇准备种你球茎的花坛，看见一个人影晃进了桤木和山杨树丛中。”我故意装作没注意，实际上我已经看清是他。他躲起来看我翻土，他一定是在跟踪我，我就是他监视的对象。我动动耙，碰碰土，都逃不过他的眼睛。”","“Then I come back to what I thought before; and the more so as last evening at sunset, whilst I was arranging the border where I am to plant your bulb, I saw a shadow gliding between the alder trees and the aspens.I did not appear to see him, but it was this man.He concealed himself and saw me digging the ground, and certainly it was me whom he followed, and me whom he was spying after.I could not move my rake, or touch one atom of soil, without his noticing it.”"
"“哦！是啊，是啊，他爱上你了。”科尔内留斯说，“他年轻吗？模样英俊吗？”","“Oh, yes, yes, he is in love with you,” said Cornelius.“Is he young?Is he handsome?”"
"说着，他焦急地看着罗莎，迫不及待地想听到她的回答。","Saying this he looked anxiously at Rosa, eagerly waiting for her answer."
"“年轻？英俊？”罗莎大声说，忍不住大笑了起来，“他模样丑陋，驼背，年近五十了，从来不敢正眼瞧我，也不敢大声说话。”","“Young? handsome?” cried Rosa, bursting into a laugh.“He is hideous to look at; crooked, nearly fifty years of age, and never dares to look me in the face, or to speak, except in an undertone.”"
"“他叫什么？”","“And his name?”"
"“雅各布·吉赛尔。”","“Jacob Gisels.”"
"“我不认识他。”","“I don’t know him.”"
"“那你明白了吧，无论如何，他不是来找你的。”","“Then you see that, at all events, he does not come after you.”"
"“不管怎样，罗莎，如果他爱你，这个很可能，他来看你就说明他爱你，可至少你不爱他。”","“At any rate, if he loves you, Rosa, which is very likely, as to see you is to love you, at least you don’t love him.”"
"“我当然不爱他。”","“To be sure I don’t.”"
"“你这么说是为了让我心安吗？”","“Then you wish me to keep my mind easy?”"
"“我确实是想劝你放宽心。”","“I should certainly ask you to do so.”"
"“那么，现在你开始会识字了，到时候我把我因为忌妒和分离的痛苦都写信给你，你也会看吧，罗莎？”","“Well, then, now as you begin to know how to read you will read all that I write to you of the pangs of jealousy and of absence, won’t you, Rosa?”"
"“我会看的，只要你把字写得大大的。”","“I shall read it, if you write with good big letters.”"
"因为话题的转变让罗莎有些不安，于是她问：","Then, as the turn which the conversation took began to make Rosa uneasy, she asked,—"
"“顺便问问，你的郁金香怎样了？”","“By the bye, how is your tulip going on?”"
"“哦，罗莎，你能想象我有多开心吗？今天早上，我把盖住球茎的土拨开，在阳光下，我看到第一批嫩芽冒出来了。这个小胚芽甚至比布伊坦霍夫广场上亲王下达的那条救我于刀下的命令更让人激动。”","“Oh, Rosa, only imagine my joy, this morning I looked at it in the sun, and after having moved the soil aside which covers the bulb, I saw the first sprouting of the leaves.This small germ has caused me a much greater emotion than the order of his Highness which turned aside the sword already raised at the Buytenhof.”"
"“那你有盼头了？”罗莎笑着说。","“You hope, then?” said Rosa, smiling."
"“是啊，是啊，我有盼头了。”","“Yes, yes, I hope.”"
"“那我呢，我什么时候种我的球茎？”","“And I, in my turn, when shall I plant my bulb?”"
"“一到合适的日子我就会告诉你。但是无论你做什么，千万不要别人帮你，不要跟世上任何一个人说这个秘密，你知道吗，行家只要一看球茎就能识得它的价值。所以，我最亲爱的罗莎，第三个球茎你得小心保管。”","“Oh, the first favourable day I will tell you; but, whatever you do, let nobody help you, and don’t confide your secret to any one in the world; do you see, a connoisseur by merely looking at the bulb would be able to distinguish its value; and so, my dearest Rosa, be careful in locking up the third sucker which remains to you.”"
"“它还包在上次你包的那张纸里，和上次你给我的时候一样。我把它放到我箱子底层，上面盖着我的针绣花边，这样既可以防潮，又不会压坏了它。但是，晚安，我可怜的囚犯先生。”","“It is still wrapped up in the same paper in which you put it, and just as you gave it me.I have laid it at the bottom of my chest under my point lace, which keeps it dry, without pressing upon it.But good night, my poor captive gentleman.”"
"“怎么？时间已经到了？”","“How? already?”"
"“是啊，我该走了。”","“It must be, it must be.”"
"“来得那么迟，走得却那么早。”","“Coming so late and going so soon.”"
"“我爸爸要是不见我回去，他可能会发脾气的，还有那个宝贝情人，也许会怀疑他有情敌呢。”","“My father might grow impatient not seeing me return, and that precious lover might suspect a rival.”"
"这时她听到了什么，变得不安起来。","Here she listened uneasily."
"“怎么了？”范巴尔莱问。“我好像听到了什么。”","“What is it?” asked Van Baerle.“I thought I heard something.”"
"“什么声音？”","“What, then?”"
"“像是脚步声，楼梯在嘎吱作响。”","“Something like a step, creaking on the staircase.”"
"“真的，”犯人说，“这不可能是格里弗斯先生，他的脚步声总是很远就能听到。”","“Surely,” said the prisoner, “that cannot be Master Gryphus, he is always heard at a distance.”"
"“是啊，我也可以肯定，这不是我爸爸，可是——”","“No, it is not my father, I am quite sure, but—”"
"“可是什么？”","“But?”"
"“可是，可能会是雅各布先生。”","“But it might be Mynheer Jacob.”"
"罗莎朝楼梯跑去，她还没下十级台阶，果然听到一扇门迅速地关上了。","Rosa rushed toward the staircase, and a door was really heard rapidly to close before the young damsel had got down the first ten steps."
"科尔内留斯对此很不安，可他哪知道这只是序曲，日后还有更多的担心呢。","Cornelius was very uneasy about it, but it was after all only a prelude to greater anxieties."
"第二天过得还算风平浪静。格里弗斯巡查了三次，可每次都扑了个空。他从来不在某个固定的时间来，就是想发现犯人的秘密。范巴尔莱也因此想出了一个发明，类似于滑轮的装置，有了它，他就可以把他的水罐在瓦檐和窗前的石头底下吊上吊下了。至于吊上吊下的绳子，他也找到了隐蔽的地方——把它们藏在瓦上和墙缝间长的青苔里。","The following day passed without any remarkable incident.Gryphus made his three visits, and discovered nothing.He never came at the same hours as he hoped thus to discover the secrets of the prisoner.Van Baerle, therefore, had devised a contrivance, a sort of pulley, by means of which he was able to lower or to raise his jug below the ledge of tiles and stone before his window.The strings by which this was effected he had found means to cover with that moss which generally grows on tiles, or in the crannies of the walls."
"格里弗斯没起什么疑心，这个装置平安无事地用了八天。然而，一天早上，科尔内留斯正专心致志地欣赏着冒出嫩芽的球茎，根本没有听见格里弗斯像能撼动整个塔楼的大风一样上楼来了，牢门忽然打开了。","Gryphus suspected nothing, and the device succeeded for eight days.One morning, however, when Cornelius, absorbed in the contemplation of his bulb, from which a germ of vegetation was already peeping forth, had not heard old Gryphus coming upstairs as a gale of wind was blowing which shook the whole tower, the door suddenly opened."
"格里弗斯不认识犯人手中的东西，那自然就是遭禁止的，他以老鹰捕食般的速度朝那东西扑过去。","Gryphus, perceiving an unknown and consequently a forbidden object in the hands of his prisoner, pounced upon it with the same rapidity as the hawk on its prey."
"命运就是这样弄人，他那只粗糙厚实的手一下子就伸到了水罐中央，伸到了球茎所在的那部分泥土上，而这只手就是当初跌断的那只手，就是科尔内留斯·范巴尔莱接好的那只手。","As ill luck would have it, his coarse, hard hand, the same which he had broken, and which Cornelius van Baerle had set so well, grasped at once in the midst of the jug, on the spot where the bulb was lying in the soil."
"“你这是什么？”他咆哮着。“哈！我抓到你了！”说完，他的手在泥里摸索着。","“What have you got here?” he roared.“Ah! have I caught you?” and with this he grabbed in the soil."
"“我？什么也没有，什么也没有！”科尔内留斯哆嗦着叫道。","“I? nothing, nothing,” cried Cornelius, trembling."
"“哈！我抓到你啦！一个水罐，还有土。这背后一定有什么阴谋诡计。”","“Ah! have I caught you? a jug and earth in it. There is some criminal secret at the bottom of all this.”"
"“啊，格里弗斯先生！”范巴尔莱哀求着，像山鹑被割麦子的人抢去了她的幼鸟一样。","“Oh, my good Master Gryphus,” said Van Baerle, imploringly, and anxious as the partridge robbed of her young by the reaper."
"事实上，格里弗斯已经开始用他弯曲的手指刨土了。","In fact, Gryphus was beginning to dig the soil with his crooked fingers."
"“当心！先生，当心！”科尔内留斯说，脸色惨白。","“Take care, sir, take care,” said Cornelius, growing quite pale."
"“当心什么？妈的！当心什么？”看守咆哮着。","“Care of what?Zounds! of what?” roared the jailer."
"“当心，我说，你会把它碰坏的，格里弗斯先生。”","“Take care, I say, you will crush it, Master Gryphus.”"
"他疯了似的一把从格里弗斯手里夺过水罐，然后把它当宝贝一样藏在胳膊底下。","And with a rapid and almost frantic movement he snatched the jug from the hands of Gryphus, and hid it like a treasure under his arms."
"可是格里弗斯，这个固执的老头，越发确信自己发现了一桩反奥兰治亲王的阴谋，他冲向犯人，举起棍子。不过看着犯人誓死捍卫他花盆的架势，他相信科尔内留斯并不怎么担心他的脑袋，倒是更担心他的水罐。","But Gryphus, obstinate, like an old man, and more and more convinced that he was discovering here a conspiracy against the Prince of Orange, rushed up to his prisoner, raising his stick; seeing, however, the impassible resolution of the captive to protect his flower-pot he was convinced that Cornelius trembled much less for his head than for his jug."
"所以他想强行把水罐夺过来。","He therefore tried to wrest it from him by force."
"“啊呀！”看守满腔怒火地说，“你瞧，你这不是造反吗？”","“Halloa!” said the jailer, furious, “here, you see, you are rebelling.”"
"“放过我的郁金香。”范巴尔莱喊道。","“Leave me my tulip,” cried Van Baerle."
"“啊！是啊，郁金香！”老头儿回答说，“你当我们不知道你们犯人的鬼把戏啊。”","“Ah, yes, tulip,” replied the old man, “we know well the shifts of prisoners.”"
"“可我对你起誓——”","“But I vow to you—”"
"“松手，”格里弗斯跺着脚，重复道，“松手，不然我就叫卫兵了。”","“Let go,” repeated Gryphus, stamping his foot, “let go, or I shall call the guard.”"
"“随你叫谁，除非你取了我性命，否则的话，你休想拿走这花。”","“Call whoever you like, but you shall not have this flower except with my life.”"
"格里弗斯怒气冲天，又把手伸进土里，拉出了黑乎乎的球茎，而范巴尔莱正在为保住了容器而庆幸，没有料到对方已经拿到了里面最宝贵的东西。格里弗斯用尽浑身的力气把发软的球茎摔在石板上，很快球茎就在他沉重的皮鞋下粉身碎骨了。","Gryphus, exasperated, plunged his finger a second time into the soil, and now he drew out the bulb, which certainly looked quite black; and whilst Van Baerle, quite happy to have saved the vessel, did not suspect that the adversary had possessed himself of its precious contents, Gryphus hurled the softened bulb with all his force on the flags, where almost immediately after it was crushed to atoms under his heavy shoe."
"范巴尔莱看着这一毁灭性的举动，一眼瞥见他心爱的球茎的汁液四溅的残骸，顿时明白格里弗斯得意万分的原因，绝望地大叫一声，这声叫喊哪怕是几年前弄死贝利松蜘蛛的冷酷看守，听了心都会熔化。","Van Baerle saw the work of destruction, got a glimpse of the juicy remains of his darling bulb, and, guessing the cause of the ferocious joy of Gryphus, uttered a cry of agony, which would have melted the heart even of that ruthless jailer who some years before killed Pelisson’s spider."
"一个念头如闪电般闪过这个郁金香迷的脑海——他恨不能打倒这个坏蛋。热血涌上了脑门，仿佛点燃了他眼中的熊熊怒火，他失去了理智，用双手举起了那个沉重的，装着现在已毫无用处的泥土的水罐。要是再迟一刹那，他就可能把这罐子砸到老格里弗斯的秃头上了。","The idea of striking down this spiteful bully passed like lightning through the brain of the tulip-fancier.The blood rushed to his brow, and seemed like fire in his eyes, which blinded him, and he raised in his two hands the heavy jug with all the now useless earth which remained in it.One instant more, and he would have flung it on the bald head of old Gryphus."
"可是一声叫喊阻止了他，是罗莎痛苦的叫声，她浑身战栗，脸色苍白，举起了双手，出现在铁窗后，介入到她父亲和她朋友之间。","But a cry stopped him; a cry of agony, uttered by poor Rosa, who, trembling and pale, with her arms raised to heaven, made her appearance behind the grated window, and thus interposed between her father and her friend."
"格里弗斯这才明白他刚才面临的危险，用最恶毒的语言破口大骂。","Gryphus then understood the danger with which he had been threatened, and he broke out in a volley of the most terrible abuse."
"科尔内留斯对他说：“你真是一个卑鄙可恶的家伙，你把一个可怜的犯人唯一的安慰——一个郁金香球茎，都夺走了。”","“Indeed,” said Cornelius to him, “you must be a very mean and spiteful fellow to rob a poor prisoner of his only consolation, a tulip bulb.”"
"“我真是为你感到惭愧，爸爸。”罗莎插话说，“你刚才是在犯罪。”","“For shame, my father,” Rosa chimed in, “it is indeed a crime you have committed here.”"
"“啊，是你吗，我的小唠叨？”老头儿怒气冲冲地转过身来冲他女儿嚷道，“这儿没你什么事，赶紧下去。”","“Ah, is that you, my little chatter-box?” the old man cried, boiling with rage and turning towards her; “don’t you meddle with what don’t concern you, but go down as quickly as possible.”"
"“我真倒霉。”科尔内留斯继续说，伤心欲绝。","“Unfortunate me,” continued Cornelius, overwhelmed with grief."
"“不就是个郁金香嘛，”格里弗斯开始为自己感到羞愧，接着讲，“你想要多少郁金香就有多少，我阁楼上就有三百朵呢。”","“After all, it is but a tulip,” Gryphus resumed, as he began to be a little ashamed of himself.“You may have as many tulips as you like: I have three hundred of them in my loft.”"
"“让你的郁金香见鬼去吧！”科尔内留斯叫道，“你也就配这些花儿了，我就是有几亿个，我也愿意来换你刚毁掉的那个。”","“To the devil with your tulips!” cried Cornelius; “you are worthy of each other: had I a hundred thousand millions of them, I would gladly give them for the one which you have just destroyed.”"
"“哦，这样啊！”格里弗斯不无得意地说，“现在我明白了。你在意的不是你的郁金香。你在意的是那个假郁金香球茎里藏的妖术，或许是你和那些阴谋家的通信方式，亲王还饶了你的性命，你还要谋反。我总是说他们没砍你的脑袋，真是天大的错误。”","“Oh, so!” Gryphus said, in a tone of triumph; “now there we have it.It was not your tulip you cared for.There was in that false bulb some witchcraft, perhaps some means of correspondence with conspirators against his Highness who has granted you your life.I always said they were wrong in not cutting your head off.”"
"“爸爸！爸爸！”罗莎叫道。","“Father, father!” cried Rosa."
"“是啊，是啊！不过现在好了，”格里弗斯重复说道，越说越有劲儿，“我把它给毁了，而且只要你还耍这鬼把戏，我还会这么做。之前我不是跟你说过嘛，年轻人，我不会让你的日子好过的。”","“Yes, yes! it is better as it is now,” repeated Gryphus, growing warm; “I have destroyed it, and I’ll do the same again, as often as you repeat the trick.Didn’t I tell you, my fine fellow, that I would make your life a hard one?”"
"“该死的！”科尔内留斯嚷道，绝望得不能自已。他用他颤抖的手指一片片拾起球茎的残片，那上面寄托着太多曾经的欢乐与希望。","“A curse on you!” Cornelius exclaimed, quite beyond himself with despair, as he gathered, with his trembling fingers, the remnants of that bulb on which he had rested so many joys and so many hopes."
"“亲爱的科尔内留斯先生，我们明天再种另外一个吧。”罗莎低声说，她了解这个不幸的郁金香迷此时是何等悲痛，也正是她，用她那无邪心灵里神圣纯洁的爱，让这句亲切的话，如滴滴甘露汇入科尔内留斯的心田，抚慰他正在流血的伤口。","“We shall plant the other to-morrow, my dear Mynheer Cornelius,” said Rosa, in a low voice, who understood the intense grief of the unfortunate tulip-fancier, and who, with the pure sacred love of her innocent heart, poured these kind words, like a drop of balm, on the bleeding wounds of Cornelius."
"第十八章 罗莎的情人","Chapter 18 Rosa’s Lover"
"罗莎这几句安慰的话语音刚落，楼道里就有人在问格里弗斯发生什么事了。","Rosa had scarcely pronounced these consolatory words when a voice was heard from the staircase asking Gryphus how matters were going on."
"“爸爸，你听到了吗？”罗莎说。","“Do you hear, father?” said Rosa."
"“什么？”","“What?”"
"“雅各布先生叫你呢，他好像挺担心的。”","“Master Jacob calls you, he is uneasy.”"
"“这么大的动静。”格里弗斯说，“谁听到了都会以为这医生要谋害我。这些读书人就是麻烦事多。”","“There was such a noise,” said Gryphus; “wouldn’t you have thought he would murder me, this doctor?They are always very troublesome fellows, these scholars.”"
"接着，他用手指了指楼道，对罗莎说：“你先走，丫头。”","Then, pointing with his finger towards the staircase, he said to Rosa: “Just lead the way, Miss.”"
"随后他锁了牢门，大声说：“我就来，我的朋友雅各布。”","After this he locked the door and called out: “I shall be with you directly, friend Jacob.”"
"可怜的科尔内留斯孤零零的一个人，吞咽着苦涩与悲痛，他喃喃自语：","Poor Cornelius, thus left alone with his bitter grief, muttered to himself,—"
"“啊，你这个老刽子手！你践踏在脚下的实际上是我啊，你把我给害了，我没法儿活下去了。”","“Ah, you old hangman! it is me you have trodden under foot; you have murdered me; I shall not survive it.”"
"要不是上天把那个名叫罗莎的女孩赐给这个可怜的犯人作为补偿，抚慰他的伤痛，他真会一病不起。","And certainly the unfortunate prisoner would have fallen ill but for the counterpoise which Providence had granted to his grief, and which was called Rosa."
"晚上罗莎又来了。她对科尔内留斯说的第一句话就是，从今往后她爸爸不会再反对他种花了。","In the evening she came back.Her first words announced to Cornelius that henceforth her father would make no objection to his cultivating flowers."
"“你怎么知道的？”犯人愁眉苦脸地问。","“And how do you know that?” the prisoner asked, with a doleful look."
"“我知道是因为他亲口说的。”","“I know it because he has said so.”"
"“或许只是为了骗我。”","“To deceive me, perhaps.”"
"“不，他为自己的所作所为后悔了。”","“No, he repents.”"
"“噢，是嘛！可惜太晚了。”","“Ah yes! but too late.”"
"“不是他自己感到后悔的。”","“This repentance is not of himself.”"
"“那是谁让他后悔的？”","“And who put it into him?”"
"“真希望你知道他朋友是如何责骂他的。”","“If you only knew how his friend scolded him!”"
"“啊！雅各布先生？他还没走？又是雅各布先生？”","“Ah, Master Jacob; he does not leave you, then, that Master Jacob?”"
"“不管怎样，他总是尽可能不离开我们。”","“At any rate, he leaves us as little as he can help.”"
"罗莎说这话的时候，冲着科尔内留斯微微一笑，顿时，笼罩在科尔内留斯眉头的嫉妒的阴云烟消云散了。","Saying this, she smiled in such a way that the little cloud of jealousy which had darkened the brow of Cornelius speedily vanished."
"“那是怎么回事啊？”犯人问。","“How was it?” asked the prisoner."
"“吃晚饭的时候，我爸爸经他的朋友一问，就把郁金香的事，更准确地说是球茎的事和他自己踩烂球茎的丰功伟绩完完整整地跟他的朋友说了。”","“Well, being asked by his friend, my father told at supper the whole story of the tulip, or rather of the bulb, and of his own fine exploit of crushing it.”"
"科尔内留斯叹了口气，那或许算得上是呻吟。","Cornelius heaved a sigh, which might have been called a groan."
"“你要是当时在场，看到雅各布先生的样子就好了。”罗莎继续说道，“我当时真以为他会放火烧了城堡。有一阵儿，他两眼如熊熊燃烧的火把，头发根根直立，紧攥着拳头，当时我以为他会把我爸掐死。”","“Had you only seen Master Jacob at that moment!” continued Rosa.“I really thought he would set fire to the castle; his eyes were like two flaming torches, his hair stood on end, and he clinched his fist for a moment; I thought he would have strangled my father.”"
"“‘你真这么做了？’他叫道，‘你把球茎踩烂了？’","“‘You have done that,’ he cried, ‘you have crushed the bulb?’"
"“‘没错啊！’","“‘Indeed I have.’"
"“‘真无耻！’雅各布先生说，‘真可恶！你这罪行犯得可不小。’","“‘It is infamous,’ said Master Jacob, ‘it is odious!You have committed a great crime!’"
"“我爸爸当时惊得目瞪口呆。","“My father was quite dumbfounded."
"“‘难不成你也疯了？’他问他的朋友。”","“‘Are you mad, too?’ he asked his friend.”"
"“啊！这位雅各布先生真不错！”科尔内留斯喃喃地说，“这个人有一个正直的灵魂，一颗卓越的心。”","“Oh, what a worthy man is this Master Jacob!” muttered Cornelius,—“an honest soul, an excellent heart that he is.”"
"“事实上，他对我爸爸粗暴到无以复加的地步。他真是很绝望，一遍一遍地重复说：","“The truth is, that it is impossible to treat a man more rudely than he did my father; he was really quite in despair, repeating over and over again,—"
"“‘踩烂了，球茎被踩烂了！上帝啊，上帝！踩烂了！’","“‘Crushed, crushed the bulb! my God, my God! crushed!’"
"“之后，他转身问我，‘他不会只有一个球茎吧？’”","“Then, turning toward me, he asked, ‘But it was not the only one that he had?’”"
"“他这样问的？”科尔内留斯有些担心地问道。","“Did he ask that?” inquired Cornelius, with some anxiety."
"“‘你认为不止这一个？’我爸爸问。‘那好，我们就把其余几个都找出来。’","“‘You think it was not the only one?’ said my father.‘Very well, we shall search for the others.’"
"“‘你还要去找其余几个？’雅各布嚷嚷着，抓住我爸爸的衣领，不过他立即就松了手。然后，他又转向我，继续问，‘那个可怜的年轻人说什么了？’","“‘You will search for the others?’ cried Jacob, taking my father by the collar; but he immediately loosed him.Then, turning towards me, he continued, asking ‘And what did that poor young man say?’"
"“我不知道如何回答是好，因为你之前再三叮嘱过，不要让任何人猜到你对这个球茎很感兴趣。庆幸的是，我爸爸替我解了围，他插话说：","“I did not know what to answer, as you had so strictly enjoined me never to allow any one to guess the interest which you are taking in the bulb.Fortunately, my father saved me from the difficulty by chiming in,—"
"“‘他说什么？他还不是大发雷霆、暴跳如雷？’","“‘What did he say?Didn’t he fume and fret?’"
"“我打断他的话说：‘爸爸，你那么粗暴，还蛮不讲理，人家生气不是很自然的事吗？’","“I interrupted him, saying, ‘Was it not natural that he should be furious, you were so unjust and brutal, father?’"
"“‘唷，你疯啦？’我爸爸嚷嚷起来，‘踩烂一个郁金香球茎算屁大点儿事啊？戈尔肯市场上买上一百个都不成问题。’","“‘Well, now, are you mad?’ cried my father; ‘what immense misfortune is it to crush a tulip bulb?You may buy a hundred of them in the market of Gorcum.’"
"“‘也许没那个珍贵呢！’我一不小心，脱口而出。”","“‘Perhaps some less precious one than that was!’ I quite incautiously replied.”"
"“雅各布听到这话有什么反应？”科尔内留斯问。","“And what did Jacob say or do at these words?” asked Cornelius."
"“我得说，他听了之后，两眼直放光，像闪电似的。”","“At these words, if I must say it, his eyes seemed to flash like lightning.”"
"“可是，”科尔内留斯说，“他的反应应该不止这些，我敢保证他一定还说了些什么。”","“But,” said Cornelius, “that was not all; I am sure he said something in his turn.”"
"“‘那么，美丽的罗莎，’他用甜得如蜜的声音说，‘这么说，你知道那个球茎很珍贵咯？’","“‘So, then, my pretty Rosa,’ he said, with a voice as sweet a honey,—’so you think that bulb to have been a precious one?’"
"“我明白自己说错话了。","“I saw that I had made a blunder."
"“‘我知道什么？’我装作无所谓的样子说，‘我又不懂什么郁金香。我只知道，我们命中注定要跟犯人在一块儿，已经够倒霉的了，对犯人来说，任何一种消遣都有其存在的价值。可怜的范巴尔莱先生就是靠这个球茎消遣。反正我觉得，把他唯一能够消遣的东西从他身边夺走实在是有些残忍。’","“‘What do I know?’ I said, negligently; ‘do I understand anything of tulips?I only know—as unfortunately it is our lot to live with prisoners—that for them any pastime is of value.This poor Mynheer van Baerle amused himself with this bulb.Well, I think it very cruel to take from him the only thing that he could have amused himself with.’"
"“‘可是，’我爸爸说，‘我们首先应该弄清楚他是怎么弄到这个球茎的。’","“‘But, first of all,’ said my father, ‘we ought to know how he has contrived to procure this bulb.’"
"“我扭过头去，想避开我爸爸的目光，可却与雅各布四目相对了。","“I turned my eyes away to avoid my father’s look; but I met those of Jacob."
"“他似乎要看穿我的心思。","“It was as if he had tried to read my thoughts at the bottom of my heart."
"“有时候，人流露出点愤怒，倒省得你去回应。我耸耸肩，转身就朝门口走去。","“Some little show of anger sometimes saves an answer.I shrugged my shoulders, turned my back, and advanced towards the door."
"“可我听到一句话，又停下了脚步，尽管他们压低了声音在那儿说，可我还是听到了。","“But I was kept by something which I heard, although it was uttered in a very low voice only."
"“雅各布跟我爸说：","“Jacob said to my father,—"
"“‘要查清楚并不困难。’","“‘It would not be so difficult to ascertain that.’"
"“‘怎么查？’","“‘How so?’"
"“‘你只要搜他的身，而且如果他还有别的球茎的话，我们一定能找到，因为一般说来会有三个球茎！’”","“‘You need only search his person: and if he has the other bulbs, we shall find them, as there usually are three suckers!’”"
"“三个球茎！”科尔内留斯惊呼，“你说过我有三个球茎吗？”","“Three suckers!” cried Cornelius.“Did you say that I have three?”"
"“我当时听到这话也跟你一样吃惊。我又转过身。他们俩都忙着说话，没注意到我的举动。","“The word certainly struck me just as much as it does you.I turned round.They were both of them so deeply engaged in their conversation that they did not observe my movement."
"“‘可是，’我爸爸说，‘他可能不会把球茎带在身上吧？’","“‘But,’ said my father, ‘perhaps he has not got his bulbs about him?’"
"“‘那你就找个由头把他带下来，我趁这时候搜他的牢房。’”","“‘Then take him down, under some pretext or other and I will search his cell in the meanwhile.’”"
"“天啊！天啊！”科尔内留斯惊呼，“由此可见，你那个雅各布先生不是什么好东西。”","“Halloa, halloa!” said Cornelius.“But this Mr. Jacob of yours is a villain, it seems.”"
"“恐怕的确如此。”","“I am afraid he is.”"
"“告诉我，罗莎。”科尔内留斯似乎在考虑什么，继续问道。","“Tell me, Rosa,” continued Cornelius, with a pensive air."
"“什么？”","“What?”"
"“你不是跟我说过，你拾掇花坛的时候，这个人跟踪过你？”","“Did you not tell me that on the day when you prepared your borders this man followed you?”"
"“没错。”","“So he did.”"
"“你还说过他像影子似的闪到接骨木后面去了？”","“That he glided like a shadow behind the elder trees?”"
"“没错。”","“Certainly.”"
"“你的一举一动都没逃过他的眼睛？”","“That not one of your movements escaped him?”"
"“真是这样。”","“Not one, indeed.”"
"“罗莎，”科尔内留斯脸色惨白地说道。","“Rosa,” said Cornelius, growing quite pale."
"“怎么了？”","“Well?”"
"“他跟踪的不是你。”","“It was not you he was after.”"
"“那是谁呢？”","“Who else, then?”"
"“他爱上的也不是你！”","“It is not you that he was in love with!”"
"“那又是谁呢？”","“But with whom else?”"
"“他跟踪的是我的球茎，爱上的是我的郁金香！”","“He was after my bulb, and is in love with my tulip!”"
"“不会吧！不过这倒是很有可能的。”罗莎说。","“You don’t say so!And yet it is very possible,” said Rosa."
"“你想查实此事吗？”","“Will you make sure of it?”"
"“怎么个查法？”","“In what manner?”"
"“呵，方法很简单！”","“Oh, it would be very easy!”"
"“说给我听听。”","“Tell me.”"
"“明天你去花园，想办法让雅各布知道，就像上次那样，你去那儿，他也会跟到那儿。假装把球茎种下去，然后离开花园，不过要从门上的钥匙孔里看他会做些什么。”","“Go to-morrow into the garden; manage matters so that Jacob may know, as he did the first time, that you are going there, and that he may follow you.Feign to put the bulb into the ground; leave the garden, but look through the keyhole of the door and watch him.”"
"“那我们接下来怎么办？”","“Well, and what then?”"
"“接下来怎么办？我们见机行事。”","“What then?We shall do as he does.”"
"“唉！”罗莎叹了口气，说，“你真的很爱你的球茎。”","“Oh!” said Rosa, with a sigh, “you are very fond of your bulbs.”"
"“跟你说实话吧，”犯人也叹了口气，说，“你爸爸把我那不幸的球茎踩烂后，我感觉我自己好像都部分瘫痪了。”","“To tell the truth,” said the prisoner, sighing likewise, “since your father crushed that unfortunate bulb, I feel as if part of my own self had been paralyzed.”"
"“现在你听我说，”罗莎说，“你会尝试点儿别的吗？”","“Now just hear me,” said Rosa; “will you try something else?”"
"“什么？”","“What?”"
"“你会采纳我爸的提议吗？”","“Will you accept the proposition of my father?”"
"“什么提议？”","“Which proposition?”"
"“他不是跟你说要拿几百个球茎换你的郁金香球茎吗？”","“Did not he offer to you tulip bulbs by hundreds?”"
"“他是这么说过。”","“Indeed he did.”"
"“你就拿两三个，和你的第三个球茎一块儿种。”","“Accept two or three, and, along with them, you may grow the third sucker.”"
"“是啊，这倒不错，”科尔内留斯皱着眉头说，“要是只有你爸爸一个，这倒不错，可还有一个雅各布先生啊，他可是盯着咱们的一举一动啊。”","“Yes, that would do very well,” said Cornelius, knitting his brow; “if your father were alone, but there is that Master Jacob, who watches all our ways.”"
"“好啦，你说的没错。不过还是好好考虑一下吧！很容易看出来，你正在剥夺自己的一大乐趣呢。”","“Well, that is true; but only think! you are depriving yourself, as I can easily see, of a very great pleasure.”"
"她笑着说的这些话，稍稍夹杂着一丝嘲弄的口气。","She pronounced these words with a smile, which was not altogether without a tinge of irony."
"科尔内留斯前思后想了片刻，他明显是在纠结于某种强烈的欲望。","Cornelius reflected for a moment; he evidently was struggling against some vehement desire."
"“不！”他带着古罗马人的坚忍最后喊道，“那会是软弱的表现，是种愚蠢，是种卑贱！如果我因此而放弃了我们拥有的唯一也是最后一点资源，把它交给愤怒和妒忌这两个恶神，去碰不可靠的运气，我自己都不会原谅我自己。不，罗莎，不！明天我们来商量你郁金香选址的事，你就照我说的去做。至于第三个球茎——”科尔内留斯长叹一口气，“你要像个吝啬鬼看着他第一枚或是最后一枚金币那样，像一位母亲守着自己的孩子那样，像一个重伤者看着自己血管里流淌的最后一滴血那样，小心看护它，罗莎！我身体里有个声音告诉我，它会是咱们的救星，它会给我们带来福泽的。”","“No!” he cried at last, with the stoicism of a Roman of old, “it would be a weakness, it would be a folly, it would be a meanness!If I thus give up the only and last resource which we possess to the uncertain chances of the bad passions of anger and envy, I should never deserve to be forgiven.No, Rosa, no; to-morrow we shall come to a conclusion as to the spot to be chosen for your tulip; you will plant it according to my instructions; and as to the third sucker,”—Cornelius here heaved a deep sigh,—“watch over it as a miser over his first or last piece of gold; as the mother over her child; as the wounded over the last drop of blood in his veins; watch over it, Rosa!Some voice within me tells me that it will be our saving, that it will be a source of good to us.”"
"“放心吧，科尔内留斯先生，”罗莎说，甜美的声音里略带伤感和严肃，“你放心吧，你的愿望对我来说就是命令。”","“Be easy, Mynheer Cornelius,” said Rosa, with a sweet mixture of melancholy and gravity, “be easy; your wishes are commands to me.”"
"“还有，”科尔内留斯对这个话题越说越起劲，继续说道，“如果你发觉你的行动被人监视了，你的话引起了你爸爸和那个该死的雅各布先生的怀疑——这样吧，罗莎，一刻都不要犹豫，牺牲我吧——我离了你没法在这世上活下去，这世上我只有你一个人——牺牲我吧，不要再来看我了。”","“And even,” continued Van Baerle, warming more and more with his subject, “if you should perceive that your steps are watched, and that your speech has excited the suspicion of your father and of that detestable Master Jacob,—well, Rosa, don’t hesitate for one moment to sacrifice me, who am only still living through you,—me, who have no one in the world but you; sacrifice me,—don’t come to see me any more.”"
"罗莎觉得自己的心沉了下去，双眼噙满了泪水。","Rosa felt her heart sink within her, and her eyes were filling with tears."
"“唉！”她说。","“Alas!” she said."
"“怎么了？”科尔内留斯问。","“What is it?” asked Cornelius."
"“我明白了一件事。”","“I see one thing.”"
"“你明白了什么？”","“What do you see?”"
"“我明白了，”她啜泣着说，“我明白你太爱你的郁金香了，你的心里根本没有更多的空间能容你去爱别的。”","“I see,” said she, bursting out in sobs, “I see that you love your tulips with such love as to have no more room in your heart left for other affections.”"
"说完，她就跑开了。","Saying this, she fled."
"听到此话后，科尔内留斯度过了有生以来最难熬的夜晚。","Cornelius, after this, passed one of the worst nights he ever had in his life."
"罗莎在生他的气，而且她生气是有道理的。也许她再不会来看犯人，而他也得不到罗莎或是他郁金香的消息了。","Rosa was vexed with him, and with good reason.Perhaps she would never return to see the prisoner, and then he would have no more news, either of Rosa or of his tulips."
"尽管这么说会让我们的主人公和园艺界蒙羞，我们还是得承认，在这两种爱之间，他更惋惜的是罗莎的离去。凌晨三点的时候，他既疲倦又懊悔，终于睡着了，在他的梦里，大黑郁金香让位给了一双美丽的弗里斯兰姑娘的可爱的蓝眼睛。","We have to confess, to the disgrace of our hero and of floriculture, that of his two affections he felt most strongly inclined to regret the loss of Rosa; and when, at about three in the morning, he fell asleep overcome with fatigue, and harassed with remorse, the grand black tulip yielded precedence in his dreams to the sweet blue eyes of the fair maid of Friesland."
"第十九章 姑娘和花","Chapter 19 The Maid and the Flower"
"但是可怜的罗莎关在自己隐蔽的房间里，不可能知道科尔内留斯梦到了什么。","But poor Rosa, in her secluded chamber, could not have known of whom or of what Cornelius was dreaming."
"从他的话语来判断，她更容易相信他梦到了黑郁金香，而不是她。可是罗莎想错了。","From what he had said she was more ready to believe that he dreamed of the black tulip than of her; and yet Rosa was mistaken."
"但是由于没有人告诉罗莎科尔内留斯到底梦到了什么，而且科尔内留斯那一番欠考虑的话像毒药一样慢慢渗透了罗莎的心，她没有做梦，而是哭了一宿。","But as there was no one to tell her so, and as the words of Cornelius’s thoughtless speech had fallen upon her heart like drops of poison, she did not dream, but she wept."
"事实上，罗莎是个心气高的女孩，心灵高尚，也不小心眼儿，她对自己的道德品质和外在容貌可能没有清晰的认识，但是她对自己的社会地位却有着非常清晰且明智的认识。","The fact was, that, as Rosa was a high-spirited creature, of no mean perception and a noble heart, she took a very clear and judicious view of her own social position, if not of her moral and physical qualities."
"而科尔内留斯是一个学者，而且很富有——至少在他的财产被充公前，他是富有的。科尔内留斯属于商业资产阶级，这个阶级的人更为自己拥有华丽纹章装饰的商店标志而自豪，而不是贵族的世袭爵徽。因此，尽管他认为罗莎是他打发百无聊赖的监禁生活的可心伴侣，可一旦涉及到他心灵的归属问题，可以肯定的是，他情愿把他的心交给郁金香——也就是，最骄傲、高贵的花儿，也不愿交给可怜的罗莎——一个卑微的监狱看守的女儿。","Cornelius was a scholar, and was wealthy,—at least he had been before the confiscation of his property; Cornelius belonged to the merchant-bourgeoisie, who were prouder of their richly emblazoned shop signs than the hereditary nobility of their heraldic bearings.Therefore, although he might find Rosa a pleasant companion for the dreary hours of his captivity, when it came to a question of bestowing his heart it was almost certain that he would bestow it upon a tulip,—that is to say, upon the proudest and noblest of flowers, rather than upon poor Rosa, the jailer’s lowly child."
"所以罗莎明白科尔内留斯对郁金香的偏爱，可正因为此，她才更伤心。","Thus Rosa understood Cornelius’s preference of the tulip to herself, but was only so much the more unhappy therefor."
"这个可怜的姑娘整夜都没合眼，早上起床前，她下定决心,今后再也不到窗洞那里去了。","During the whole of this terrible night the poor girl did not close an eye, and before she rose in the morning she had come to the resolution of making her appearance at the grated window no more."
"可是，因为她知道科尔内留斯急切地盼望着郁金香的消息，尽管她已下定决心，今后不再见他，她对他命运的同情已经迅速发展为爱情，可另一方面，她又不希望他因此而沉沦，她决心继续自学读书写字。庆幸的是，她进步很快，几乎无需老师的指点，如果这位老师不是科尔内留斯的话。","But as she knew with what ardent desire Cornelius looked forward to the news about his tulip; and as, notwithstanding her determination not to see any more a man her pity for whose fate was fast growing into love, she did not, on the other hand, wish to drive him to despair, she resolved to continue by herself the reading and writing lessons; and, fortunately, she had made sufficient progress to dispense with the help of a master when the master was not to be Cornelius."
"因此，罗莎翻来覆去地念着科尔内留斯·范巴尔莱写在科尔内留斯·德维特《圣经》第二页上的遗嘱。","Rosa therefore applied herself most diligently to reading poor Cornelius de Witt’s Bible, on the second fly leaf of which the last will of Cornelius van Baerle was written."
"“唉！”她咕哝着，每次读这遗嘱，她都是流着泪读完的，爱的珍珠从她清澈的眼里流出，滚落到她苍白的面颊，“唉！我当时还一度认为他是爱我的。”","“Alas!” she muttered, when perusing again this document, which she never finished without a tear, the pearl of love, rolling from her limpid eyes on her pale cheeks—“alas! at that time I thought for one moment he loved me.”"
"可怜的罗莎！她想错了。犯人的爱情从来没有像我们现在所描述的时刻这样真挚，在黑郁金香和罗莎的角逐中，科尔内留斯的心里早已把首要位置留给了罗莎。","Poor Rosa! she was mistaken.Never had the love of the prisoner been more sincere than at the time at which we are now arrived, when in the contest between the black tulip and Rosa the tulip had had to yield to her the first and foremost place in Cornelius’s heart."
"可是罗莎并没意识到这点。","But Rosa was not aware of it."
"读完之后，她拿起了笔，用值得称赞的勤勉开始了更为艰巨的任务——写字。","Having finished reading, she took her pen, and began with as laudable diligence the by far more difficult task of writing."
"然而，科尔内留斯不小心对罗莎敞开了心扉的那天，罗莎已经可以写清晰可辨的字了，所以罗莎并没有对写字丧失信心，她要取得飞速的进步，至少要在八天后，能把郁金香的情况记录下来告诉犯人。","As, however, Rosa was already able to write a legible hand when Cornelius so uncautiously opened his heart, she did not despair of progressing quickly enough to write, after eight days at the latest, to the prisoner an account of his tulip."
"科尔内留斯对她的叮嘱她一句都没有忘，事实上，他的每一句话都珍藏在她的心里，哪怕不是对她的叮嘱，她都牢牢地记在了心里。","She had not forgotten one word of the directions given to her by Cornelius, whose speeches she treasured in her heart, even when they did not take the shape of directions."
"而他呢，醒来的时候发现自己从未如此一往情深过。在他心目中，郁金香还是那么鲜艳夺目，可他不会再把它看作是一件珍宝，一件值得牺牲一切甚至是罗莎的珍宝，而是把它视为自然和艺术巧夺天工的结合，是一朵他愿意佩戴在他爱人胸前的奇葩。","He, on his part, awoke deeper in love than ever.The tulip, indeed, was still a luminous and prominent object in his mind; but he no longer looked upon it as a treasure to which he ought to sacrifice everything, and even Rosa, but as a marvellous combination of nature and art with which he would have been happy to adorn the bosom of his beloved one."
"然而，一种隐约的不安一整天都困扰在他的心头，这种不安实际上是担心罗莎晚上不会再像往常一样来看他。这样的想法慢慢地吞噬他的心，到傍晚的时候，他满脑子想的都是如此。","Yet during the whole of that day he was haunted with a vague uneasiness, at the bottom of which was the fear lest Rosa should not come in the evening to pay him her usual visit.This thought took more and more hold of him, until at the approach of evening his whole mind was absorbed in it."
"夜幕降临的时候，他的心怦怦直跳。他那天晚上对罗莎说的那些让她痛苦万分的话，此时如此真切地回荡在耳畔，他问自己，对能给自己慰藉的人，那些话怎么说得出口，竟然说为了他的郁金香，可以牺牲他，也就是说必要的时候不要再和他见面。要知道，和罗莎见面已经成了他生活的必需。","How his heart beat when darkness closed in!The words which he had said to Rosa on the evening before and which had so deeply afflicted her, now came back to his mind more vividly than ever, and he asked himself how he could have told his gentle comforter to sacrifice him to his tulip,—that is to say, to give up seeing him, if need be,—whereas to him the sight of Rosa had become a condition of life."
"在科尔内留斯的牢房里，可以听到监狱的钟声。七点，八点，接着敲响了九下。从来没有金属声能像这最后一声钟响一样震撼人们的心灵，科尔内留斯的心里清楚，已经九点了。　","In Cornelius’s cell one heard the chimes of the clock of the fortress.It struck seven, it struck eight, it struck nine.Never did the metal voice vibrate more forcibly through the heart of any man than did the last stroke, marking the ninth hour, through the heart of Cornelius."
"一切又都归于了平静。科尔内留斯捂住胸口，仿佛要压制住他狂乱的心跳，他静静地聆听着。","All was then silent again.Cornelius put his hand on his heart, to repress as it were its violent palpitation, and listened."
"她的脚步声，衣裙摩擦楼梯的窸窣声，他都是如此熟悉，以前她刚迈上第一个台阶，他就会自言自语道：","The noise of her footstep, the rustling of her gown on the staircase, were so familiar to his ear, that she had no sooner mounted one step than he used to say to himself,—"
"“罗莎来了。”","“Here comes Rosa.”"
"可这个晚上，厅堂里没有任何这些声响打破寂静，钟敲响了九点一刻，九点半，接着九点四十五，最后一声浑厚的钟响不仅向监狱的犯人，也向所有洛维斯坦因的居民宣布，十点了。","This evening none of those little noises broke the silence of the lobby, the clock struck nine, and a quarter; the half-hour, then a quarter to ten, and at last its deep tone announced, not only to the inmates of the fortress, but also to all the inhabitants of Loewestein, that it was ten."
"这通常是罗莎离开科尔内留斯的时间。现在时间到了，可罗莎却还没有来。","This was the hour at which Rosa generally used to leave Cornelius.The hour had struck, but Rosa had not come."
"如此看来，他的预感并没有欺骗他。罗莎生气了，把自己关在屋子里，让他自己打发百无聊赖的时光。","Thus then his foreboding had not deceived him; Rosa, being vexed, shut herself up in her room and left him to himself."
"“哎呀！”他想，“我真是活该！她不会再来了，她不来也对。换作我，我也会这么做。”","“Alas!” he thought, “I have deserved all this.She will come no more, and she is right in staying away; in her place I should do just the same.”"
"尽管如此，科尔内留斯还是耐心地等待着、聆听着、希冀着，直到半夜，他才和衣倒在床上。","Yet notwithstanding all this, Cornelius listened, waited, and hoped until midnight, then he threw himself upon the bed, with his clothes on."
"漫漫长夜，悲伤席卷着他，而白天也不能带给他任何希望。","It was a long and sad night for him, and the day brought no hope to the prisoner."
"早上八点，牢门开了；可科尔内留斯头都没有回。他早就听到厅堂里传来格里弗斯沉重的脚步声，他完全清楚监狱看守是一个人来的。","At eight in the morning, the door of his cell opened; but Cornelius did not even turn his head; he had heard the heavy step of Gryphus in the lobby, but this step had perfectly satisfied the prisoner that his jailer was coming alone."
"所以科尔内留斯甚至没有回头看格里弗斯。","Thus Cornelius did not even look at Gryphus."
"可是，他很想从格里弗斯那儿套点话，打听一下罗莎的情况。尽管这样做她父亲会觉得很奇怪，他还是差点就问了。老实说，他甚至自私地希望听到格里弗斯说他女儿病了。","And yet he would have been so glad to draw him out, and to inquire about Rosa.He even very nearly made this inquiry, strange as it would needs have appeared to her father.To tell the truth, there was in all this some selfish hope to hear from Gryphus that his daughter was ill."
"除非特殊情况，罗莎白天从没来过。因此，只要是白天，科尔内留斯就没期待罗莎会来。然而他突然一激灵，贴着门听外面的动静，铁窗外稍微有点风吹草动就瞟一眼，这些无不说明犯人内心里暗暗希望罗莎会出于某种原因打破惯例。","Except on extraordinary occasions, Rosa never came during the day.Cornelius therefore did not really expect her as long as the day lasted.Yet his sudden starts, his listening at the door, his rapid glances at every little noise towards the grated window, showed clearly that the prisoner entertained some latent hope that Rosa would, somehow or other, break her rule."
"格里弗斯第二次来的时候，科尔内留斯一反常态，用最动听的声音询问老狱卒他女儿的健康状况，可是格里弗斯只简洁地回答说：","At the second visit of Gryphus, Cornelius, contrary to all his former habits, asked the old jailer, with the most winning voice, about her health; but Gryphus contented himself with giving the laconical answer,—"
"“一切都好。”","“All’s well.”"
"等他第三次来的时候，科尔内留斯换了一种询问方式：","At the third visit of the day, Cornelius changed his former inquiry:—"
"“我希望洛维斯坦因没人生病吧？”","“I hope nobody is ill at Loewestein?”"
"“没人。”监狱看守回答得更为简洁，说着，就当着犯人的面，砰的一声关上了门。","“Nobody,” replied, even more laconically, the jailer, shutting the door before the nose of the prisoner."
"格里弗斯有些不太习惯科尔内留斯这样客套，开始怀疑他的犯人是不是想要收买他。","Gryphus, being little used to this sort of civility on the part of Cornelius, began to suspect that his prisoner was about to try and bribe him."
"科尔内留斯又是一个人了。晚上七点，昨天的焦虑变本加厉地卷土重来。","Cornelius was now alone once more; it was seven o’clock in the evening, and the anxiety of yesterday returned with increased intensity."
"可是希望又一次落空了，时间无情地滑过，却没带来罗莎的倩影，她的出现可以穿越铁窗，照亮可怜的科尔内留斯的牢房，即使她离开，余下的光亮也能一直温暖他的心房，直到她再次出现。","But another time the hours passed away without bringing the sweet vision which lighted up, through the grated window, the cell of poor Cornelius, and which, in retiring, left light enough in his heart to last until it came back again."
"范巴尔莱在极端绝望中度过了一夜。第二天，格里弗斯出现在他的面前，比往常还要凶神恶煞、面目可憎。在他脑子里，更确切地说在他内心里，还心存侥幸地希望是这个老头儿不让他的闺女来的。","Van Baerle passed the night in an agony of despair.On the following day Gryphus appeared to him even more hideous, brutal, and hateful than usual; in his mind, or rather in his heart, there had been some hope that it was the old man who prevented his daughter from coming."
"盛怒之下，他恨不能一把掐死格里弗斯，可这么做，罗莎难道不会永远离开他吗？","In his wrath he would have strangled Gryphus, but would not this have separated him for ever from Rosa?"
"天色渐暗，他的绝望变成了忧郁，他不由自主地想到了他可怜的郁金香，心情更加沮丧。正值四月好时节，经验丰富的园丁都说，这是种植郁金香的黄金时间。他曾对罗莎说：","The evening closing in, his despair changed into melancholy, which was the more gloomy as, involuntarily, Van Baerle mixed up with it the thought of his poor tulip.It was now just that week in April which the most experienced gardeners point out as the precise time when tulips ought to be planted.He had said to Rosa,—"
"“我会告诉你什么时候把球茎种下去的。”","“I shall tell you the day when you are to put the bulb in the ground.”"
"他本来打算把第二天确定为做这件大事的日子，他等待着跟罗莎见面，结果却是枉然。天气适宜，潮湿的空气在四月和煦的阳光下也得到了缓解，四月初的阳光虽然有些惨淡，但也宜人。如果罗莎错过这种植球茎的好时机——本来再也见不着罗莎，科尔内留斯就够伤心了，如果郁金香因为种迟了或没有种，再也开不了花，那无疑是雪上加霜，他定会扼腕叹息的！","He had intended to fix, at the vainly hoped for interview, the following day as the time for that momentous operation.The weather was propitious; the air, though still damp, began to be tempered by those pale rays of the April sun which, being the first, appear so congenial, although so pale.How if Rosa allowed the right moment for planting the bulb to pass by,—if, in addition to the grief of seeing her no more, he should have to deplore the misfortune of seeing his tulip fail on account of its having been planted too late, or of its not having been planted at all!"
"这两件恼火的事情交织到一起，就足够让他不吃不喝了。","These two vexations combined might well make him leave off eating and drinking."
"第四天的情况就是如此。","This was the case on the fourth day."
"你要是看到科尔内留斯的境况，定会心生怜悯。他难过得一声不吭，人也因为完全虚脱而脸色苍白，他把头伸出窗户的铁栅栏——要知道头伸出去了就难进来——就是为了看一眼左手边罗莎曾经说过的花园，她说从花园的护墙可以俯瞰河流。他希望他能看到四月阳光下的罗莎或是郁金香，这两样他已失去的挚爱。","It was pitiful to see Cornelius, dumb with grief, and pale from utter prostration, stretch out his head through the iron bars of his window, at the risk of not being able to draw it back again, to try and get a glimpse of the garden on the left spoken of by Rosa, who had told him that its parapet overlooked the river.He hoped that perhaps he might see, in the light of the April sun, Rosa or the tulip, the two lost objects of his love."
"晚上，格里弗斯撤走了科尔内留斯的早饭和中饭，他几乎没有碰。","In the evening, Gryphus took away the breakfast and dinner of Cornelius, who had scarcely touched them."
"第二天，他滴米未沾，格里弗斯又把饭菜原封不动地端走了。","On the following day he did not touch them at all, and Gryphus carried the dishes away just as he had brought them."
"科尔内留斯一整天都躺在床上。","Cornelius had remained in bed the whole day."
"“这下好了，” 格里弗斯查完最后一次房，下来说，“我想咱们要不了多久就可以摆脱我们的学者了。”","“Well,” said Gryphus, coming down from the last visit, “I think we shall soon get rid of our scholar.”"
"罗莎大吃一惊。","Rosa was startled."
"“你又在那儿胡说！”雅各布说。“你什么意思啊？”","“Nonsense!” said Jacob.“What do you mean?”"
"“他不吃不喝，连床都不下。他会像格劳休斯先生一样，离开的时候被装在箱子里，只不过这箱子是口棺材。”","“He doesn’t drink, he doesn’t eat, he doesn’t leave his bed.He will get out of it, like Mynheer Grotius, in a chest, only the chest will be a coffin.”"
"罗莎脸色煞白。","Rosa grew pale as death."
"“啊！”她自言自语道，“他是担心他的郁金香。”","“Ah!” she said to herself, “he is uneasy about his tulip.”"
"她心情沉重地起身回到自己的房间，拿出纸笔，用了一整晚的时间在那里描字。","And, rising with a heavy heart, she returned to her chamber, where she took a pen and paper, and during the whole of that night busied herself with tracing letters."
"第二天早上，科尔内留斯起来，一步步挪到窗前，看到一张从门缝里塞进来的纸条。","On the following morning, when Cornelius got up to drag himself to the window, he perceived a paper which had been slipped under the door."
"他立马拾起纸条，展开来看，他几乎辨认不出那是罗莎的字迹，她没来的这短短的七天里，想不到进步这么快，纸条上这样写道：","He pounced upon it, opened it, and read the following words, in a handwriting which he could scarcely have recognized as that of Rosa, so much had she improved during her short absence of seven days,—"
"“请放心，你的郁金香很好。”","“Be easy; your tulip is going on well.”"
"尽管罗莎这寥寥几个字某种程度上缓解了科尔内留斯的悲伤，可他还是感到了这字里行间隐含的冷嘲热讽。这么说，罗莎并没生病，而是生气了。没有谁强加阻拦不让她来，是她自愿离开他的。这么说，罗莎是自由身，是她从自己的意志中获得了不再来看他的决心和力量，而他却因为见不着她而伤心欲绝。","Although these few words of Rosa’s somewhat soothed the grief of Cornelius, yet he felt not the less the irony which was at the bottom of them.Rosa, then, was not ill, she was offended; she had not been forcibly prevented from coming, but had voluntarily stayed away.Thus Rosa, being at liberty, found in her own will the force not to come and see him, who was dying with grief at not having seen her."
"科尔内留斯有罗莎曾给他拿来的纸和笔。他估摸着她一定会等着回复，但她只会在天黑后来取。于是他在一张与他刚收到的差不多大小的纸条上，写下：","Cornelius had paper and a pencil which Rosa had brought to him.He guessed that she expected an answer, but that she would not come before the evening to fetch it.He therefore wrote on a piece of paper, similar to that which he had received,—"
"“我生病不是因为我担心郁金香，而是因为见不着你太伤心。”","“It was not my anxiety about the tulip that has made me ill, but the grief at not seeing you.”"
"待格里弗斯查完最后一次房后，天色已经暗下来，他把纸条从门缝底下塞出去，然后全神贯注地听着外面的动静，可他既没听到罗莎的脚步声，也没听到她衣裙的窸窣声。","After Gryphus had made his last visit of the day, and darkness had set in, he slipped the paper under the door, and listened with the most intense attention, but he neither heard Rosa’s footsteps nor the rustling of her gown."
"他只听到跟呼吸一样细微，与爱抚一样温柔的声音，耳语般地从牢房门的窗洞外吹进这几个字：","He only heard a voice as feeble as a breath, and gentle like a caress, which whispered through the grated little window in the door the word,—"
"“明天见！”","“To-morrow!”"
"明天就是第八天。科尔内留斯和罗莎已经有八天没见面了。","Now to-morrow was the eighth day.For eight days Cornelius and Rosa had not seen each other."
"第二十章 这八天里发生的事","Chapter 20 The Events which took place during those Eight Days"
"第二天晚上老时间，范巴尔莱听到有人轻叩铁窗，要知道罗莎在他们最亲密的日子里，经常这样做。","On the following evening, at the usual hour, Van Baerle heard some one scratch at the grated little window, just as Rosa had been in the habit of doing in the heyday of their friendship."
"不难想象，科尔内留斯就守在牢门不远处，他终于见到了罗莎，只见她掌着灯在门外等候着他。","Cornelius being, as may easily be imagined, not far off from the door, perceived Rosa, who at last was waiting again for him with her lamp in her hand."
"看到他满脸的悲伤，脸色苍白，她不禁大吃一惊，说：","Seeing him so sad and pale, she was startled, and said,—"
"“你病了吗，科尔内留斯先生？”","“You are ill, Mynheer Cornelius?”"
"“嗯，我病了。”他回答，因为无论是肉体还是精神上，他都很痛苦。","“Yes, I am,” he answered, as indeed he was suffering in mind and in body."
"“我看到了，你没吃饭。”罗莎说，“我爸还跟我说你整天都躺在床上。所以我才给你写信，让你别再为那个你最牵挂的宝贝的命运担心了。”","“I saw that you did not eat,” said Rosa; “my father told me that you remained in bed all day.I then wrote to calm your uneasiness concerning the fate of the most precious object of your anxiety.”"
"“我，”科尔内留斯说，“我也给你回了信。看见你来了，亲爱的罗莎，我还以为你已经收到我的信了。”","“And I,” said Cornelius, “I have answered.Seeing your return, my dear Rosa, I thought you had received my letter.”"
"“没错，我收到了。”","“It is true; I have received it.”"
"“这次你再不能为自己开脱，说自己不识字了吧。你现在不仅读得流畅，写字也是进步神速啊。”","“You cannot this time excuse yourself with not being able to read.Not only do you read very fluently, but also you have made marvellous progress in writing.”"
"“不错，我不仅收到了，还读了你的便条。所以我才来看看有没有什么办法，让你身体恢复。”","“Indeed, I have not only received, but also read your note.Accordingly I am come to see whether there might not be some remedy to restore you to health.”"
"“让我身体恢复？”科尔内留斯叫道，“可是，你就没有什么好消息要跟我说？”","“Restore me to health?” cried Cornelius; “but have you any good news to communicate to me?”"
"说着，可怜的犯人瞅着罗莎，眼里充满了希望。","Saying this, the poor prisoner looked at Rosa, his eyes sparkling with hope."
"罗莎或许不明白他的眼神，或许是不愿意弄明白，一脸严肃地说：","Whether she did not, or would not, understand this look, Rosa answered gravely,—"
"“我只想跟你说说你的郁金香，因为我很清楚，在你心中，郁金香最重要。”","“I have only to speak to you about your tulip, which, as I well know, is the object uppermost in your mind.”"
"罗莎冷冷地说着那些话，字字如刀，深深地刺痛了科尔内留斯的心。这个可怜的姑娘说起她的情敌——郁金香的时候，故意装作一脸漠然，他也没怀疑在这漠不关心的外表之下到底隐藏着什么。","Rosa pronounced those few words in a freezing tone, which cut deeply into the heart of Cornelius.He did not suspect what lay hidden under this appearance of indifference with which the poor girl affected to speak of her rival, the black tulip."
"“唉！”科尔内留斯小声抱怨着，“又来了！又来了！罗莎，我不是跟你说过，我想的只有你？我只为你痛惜，我只思念你，你不在我身边，会让我觉得哪怕失去自由和生命都无足轻重！”","“Oh!” muttered Cornelius, “again! again! Have I not told you, Rosa, that I thought but of you? that it was you alone whom I regretted, you whom I missed, you whose absence I felt more than the loss of liberty and of life itself?”"
"罗莎幽幽一笑。","Rosa smiled with a melancholy air."
"“啊！”她说，“你的郁金香现在很危险。”","“Ah!” she said, “your tulip has been in such danger.”"
"科尔内留斯本能地打了个寒噤，如果罗莎这么说只是想设个圈套的话，毫无疑问，他已经落入了陷阱。","Cornelius trembled involuntarily, and showed himself clearly to be caught in the trap, if ever the remark was meant as such."
"“危险？”他有些惊慌失措，嚷嚷着，“什么危险？”","“Danger!” he cried, quite alarmed; “what danger?”"
"罗莎怜爱地望着他，她知道自己对他期望太高，已经超出了这个男人的能力所及，要接受本来的他，就得接受他的小缺点。","Rosa looked at him with gentle compassion; she felt that what she wished was beyond the power of this man, and that he must be taken as he was, with his little foible."
"“是的，”她说，“你之前猜得没错，那个追求者，那个情郎雅各布不是冲着我来的。”","“Yes,” she said, “you have guessed the truth; that suitor and amorous swain, Jacob, did not come on my account.”"
"“那他是冲什么来的？”科尔内留斯急切地问。","“And what did he come for?” Cornelius anxiously asked."
"“他是冲郁金香来的。”","“He came for the sake of the tulip.”"
"“哎呀！”科尔内留斯说，听到这消息，他脸色愈加苍白，两星期前，罗莎跟他说雅各布在追求她的时候，他的脸色都没有如此难看。","“Alas!” said Cornelius, growing even paler at this piece of information than he had been when Rosa, a fortnight before, had told him that Jacob was coming for her sake."
"罗莎察觉出他的恐慌，科尔内留斯从她的表情上也猜出了几分，知道她心里在想什么。","Rosa saw this alarm, and Cornelius guessed, from the expression of her face, in what direction her thoughts were running."
"“唉！原谅我，罗莎！”他说，“我了解你，我很清楚，你是个善良诚实的姑娘。上帝赐予你思想和力量来保护你自己，可我那可怜的郁金香，当它们处于危险的境地时，上帝却没有赐予它们保护自己的力量。”","“Oh, pardon me, Rosa!” he said, “I know you, and I am well aware of the kindness and sincerity of your heart.To you God has given the thought and strength for defending yourself; but to my poor tulip, when it is in danger, God has given nothing of the sort.”"
"罗莎对犯人的辩解没做回应，接着说：","Rosa, without replying to this excuse of the prisoner, continued,—"
"“从我认出那个跟着我的家伙就是雅各布的那一刻起，我知道你很担心，其实我比你还要担心。所以，在我最后一次见你的那天，也就是那天你说——”","“From the moment when I first knew that you were uneasy on account of the man who followed me, and in whom I had recognized Jacob, I was even more uneasy myself.On the day, therefore, after that on which I saw you last, and on which you said—”"
"科尔内留斯打断她的话。","Cornelius interrupted her."
"“我再次请你原谅我，罗莎！”他大声说，“我错了，我不该跟你说那些话。我之前已经请你原谅我的那些冒昧之辞了。我现在再次请求你的原谅，难道就永远没有办法挽回吗？”","“Once more, pardon me, Rosa!” he cried.“I was wrong in saying to you what I said.I have asked your pardon for that unfortunate speech before.I ask it again: shall I always ask it in vain?”"
"“第二天，”罗莎接着说，“想起你告诉过我的，要施点计，弄清楚这个讨厌的家伙到底是跟着郁金香，还是跟着我——”","“On the following day,” Rosa continued, “remembering what you had told me about the stratagem which I was to employ to ascertain whether that odious man was after the tulip, or after me—”"
"“没错，是挺讨厌的。告诉我，”他说，“你恨这个家伙吗？”","“Yes, yes, odious.Tell me,” he said, “do you hate that man?”"
"“我当然恨他。”罗莎说，“要不是他，我这八天里怎么会有那些不开心。”","“I do hate him,” said Rosa, “as he is the cause of all the unhappiness I have suffered these eight days.”"
"“你也过得不开心，罗莎？真谢谢你这番告白。”","“You, too, have been unhappy, Rosa?I thank you a thousand times for this kind confession.”"
"“就在我们闹不愉快的第二天，我下楼到花园里，沿着要种郁金香的花坛走，边走边四处张望，看看是不是像上回一样被人跟着。”","“Well, on the day after that unfortunate one, I went down into the garden and proceeded towards the border where I was to plant your tulip, looking round all the while to see whether I was again followed as I was last time.”"
"“然后呢？”科尔内留斯问。","“And then?” Cornelius asked."
"“然后我看见门和围墙中间晃过同样的身影，接着那身影又躲到接骨木后，不见了。”","“And then the same shadow glided between the gate and the wall, and once more disappeared behind the elder-trees.”"
"“你就装作没看见他，对吧？”科尔内留斯问，想起了当时他跟罗莎交代的种种细节。","“You feigned not to see him, didn’t you?” Cornelius asked, remembering all the details of the advice which he had given to Rosa."
"“是啊，我就蹲在花坛边，用铲子挖坑，就像真的要种球茎似的。”","“Yes, and I stooped over the border, in which I dug with a spade, as if I was going to put the bulb in.”"
"“那他呢，他这时候在做什么？”","“And he,—what did he do during all this time?”"
"“我看见他躲在树枝后虎视眈眈地瞅着我呢。”","“I saw his eyes glisten through the branches of the tree like those of a tiger.”"
"“你看，你看！”科尔内留斯嚷嚷着。","“There you see, there you see!” cried Cornelius."
"“我装模作样地干完活儿，就回去了。”","“Then, after having finished my make-believe work, I retired.”"
"“但我敢说，你只回到了花园门口，这样你就可以从钥匙孔里看看，你离开后他会干什么，对吧？”","“But only behind the garden door, I dare say, so that you might see through the keyhole what he was going to do when you had left?”"
"“他等了一会儿，很可能是想确定我不会回来了，然后蹑手蹑脚地从他躲着的地方出来，绕了一大圈儿，走到花坛跟前。他总算找着目标了，就是刚翻的那块地，他停下来，装作漫不经心的样子，东张西望，扫视花园的每一个角落、邻近房屋的每一个窗户，甚至连空中都看了个遍，待他确定周围只有他一个人，没有人会看到他的所作所为后，他扑向花坛，把双手插进松软的泥土，捧起一抔土，用手指轻轻捻碎，看看里面有没有球茎，这样重复了两三次，他才明白过来——他被人算计了。后来，他强压满腔的怒火，拿起耙子，把土耙平，这样花坛在他走的时候和他刚发现的时候一样。他羞愤交加地回到门口，装出随便逛逛花园的人那种满不在乎的样子。”","“He waited for a moment, very likely to make sure of my not coming back, after which he sneaked forth from his hiding-place, and approached the border by a long round-about; at last, having reached his goal, that is to say, the spot where the ground was newly turned, he stopped with a careless air, looking about in all directions, and scanning every corner of the garden, every window of the neighbouring houses, and even the sky; after which, thinking himself quite alone, quite isolated, and out of everybody’s sight, he pounced upon the border, plunged both his hands into the soft soil, took a handful of the mould, which he gently frittered between his fingers to see whether the bulb was in it, and repeated the same thing twice or three times, until at last he perceived that he was outwitted.Then, keeping down the agitation which was raging in his breast, he took up the rake, smoothed the ground, so as to leave it on his retiring in the same state as he had found it, and, quite abashed and rueful, walked back to the door, affecting the unconcerned air of an ordinary visitor of the garden.”"
"“唉！这个混蛋！”科尔内留斯咕哝着，拭去了额头的冷汗，“唉！这个混蛋！我早就猜着他的意图了。可球茎呢，罗莎，你怎么处置的？现在再种球茎已经迟了。”","“Oh, the wretch!” muttered Cornelius, wiping the cold sweat from his brow.“Oh, the wretch!I guessed his intentions.But the bulb, Rosa; what have you done with it?It is already rather late to plant it.”"
"“球茎？它已经在地里六天了。”","“The bulb?It has been in the ground for these six days.”"
"“你种在哪儿了？怎么种的？”科尔内留斯叫道，“老天！你也太轻率了！它到底怎么样了？它种在什么样的土里？朝向怎样？是好是坏？你就不怕被那个可恶的雅各布偷走？”","“Where? and how?” cried Cornelius.“Good Heaven, what imprudence!What is it?In what sort of soil is it?In what aspect?Good or bad?Is there no risk of having it filched by that detestable Jacob?”"
"“没有被偷的危险，”罗莎说，“除非雅各布破门而入，闯进我的房间。”","“There is no danger of its being stolen,” said Rosa, “unless Jacob will force the door of my chamber.”"
"“噢！这么说，它在你那儿，在你卧房里？”科尔内留斯说，稍微松了口气，“可是土壤情况怎样？你把它种在什么容器里了？我希望，你没把它种在水里吧？那些哈勒姆和多特的小姐太太们总以为水能取代泥土。”","“Oh! then it is with you in your bedroom?” said Cornelius, somewhat relieved.“But in what soil? in what vessel?You don’t let it grow, I hope, in water like those good ladies of Haarlem and Dort, who imagine that water could replace the earth?”"
"“在这点上，你大可放心。”罗莎笑着说，“你的球茎没有养在水里。”","“You may make yourself comfortable on that score,” said Rosa, smiling; “your bulb is not growing in water.”"
"“我又松了一口气。”","“I breathe again.”"
"“我把它种在一个很好的、结实的石盆里了，大小跟你种郁金香的水罐差不多。土壤是由三份花园里最好地段的普通泥土混上一份路上的尘土构成的。我听你还有那个你认为可恶的雅各布说过，你们常说什么样的土壤最适合郁金香的种植，我现在对这方面的了解不亚于哈勒姆第一流的园丁。”","“It is in a good, sound stone pot, just about the size of the jug in which you had planted yours.The soil is composed of three parts of common mould, taken from the best spot of the garden, and one of the sweepings of the road.I have heard you and that detestable Jacob, as you call him, so often talk about what is the soil best fitted for growing tulips, that I know it as well as the first gardener of Haarlem.”"
"“那花儿的朝向好吗，罗莎？”","“And now what is the aspect, Rosa?”"
"“目前看来花儿一整天都晒得着太阳，当然得是出太阳的时候。可等它冒出芽了，我就得照你曾做过的那样做，亲爱的科尔内留斯先生。我早上八点到十一点得把它搬出窗外，搁在东面，下午三点到五点的时候得拿进来，放到西边。","“At present it has the sun all day long,—that is to say when the sun shines.But when it once peeps out of the ground, I shall do as you have done here, dear Mynheer Cornelius: I shall put it out of my window on the eastern side from eight in the morning until eleven and in my window towards the west from three to five in the afternoon.”"
"“没错！没错！”科尔内留斯叫道，“你真是一个模范园丁，我美丽的罗莎。可我担心培植我的郁金香会占据你全部的时间。”","“That’s it! that’s it!” cried Cornelius; “and you are a perfect gardener, my pretty Rosa.But I am afraid the nursing of my tulip will take up all your time.”"
"“是啊。”罗莎说，“不过没关系。你的郁金香就是我的女儿。如果我是位母亲，我对自己的孩子应该投入多少时间，我就会投入同样的时间在你的郁金香上。只有我成了它的母亲，”罗莎微笑着补充说道，“我才不会再是它的情敌。”","“Yes, it will,” said Rosa; “but never mind.Your tulip is my daughter.I shall devote to it the same time as I should to a child of mine, if I were a mother.Only by becoming its mother,” Rosa added, smilingly, “can I cease to be its rival.”"
"“我美丽善良的罗莎！”科尔内留斯喃喃地说，说着他望了姑娘一眼，那是爱人的目光，柔情多于园丁之间的友谊，这一瞥给了罗莎些许安慰。","“My kind and pretty Rosa!” muttered Cornelius casting on her a glance in which there was much more of the lover than of the gardener, and which afforded Rosa some consolation."
"然后，片刻的沉默之后，科尔内留斯握住了铁窗缝隙间罗莎退缩的手，接着他问：","Then, after a silence of some moments, during which Cornelius had grasped through the openings of the grating for the receding hand of Rosa, he said,—"
"“你是说球茎已经在土里六天了？”","“Do you mean to say that the bulb has now been in the ground for six days?”"
"“嗯，六天了，科尔内留斯先生。”她回答。","“Yes, six days, Mynheer Cornelius,” she answered."
"“它还没发芽？”","“And it does not yet show leaf?”"
"“没有，不过我想明天就会发芽了。”","“No, but I think it will to-morrow.”"
"“那明天你来跟我说说它的消息，还有你的消息，罗莎，好吗？用你的话说，我很关心这个女儿，可我更关心这位母亲。”","“Well, then, to-morrow you will bring me news about it, and about yourself, won’t you, Rosa?I care very much for the daughter, as you called it just now, but I care even much more for the mother.”"
"“明天？”罗莎说着，斜睨着科尔内留斯，“我不知道我明天能不能来。”","“To-morrow?” said Rosa, looking at Cornelius askance.“I don’t know whether I shall be able to come to-morrow.”"
"“我的上帝！”科尔内留斯说，“你为什么来不了？”","“Good heavens!” said Cornelius, “why can’t you come to-morrow?”"
"“科尔内留斯先生，我有很多事情要做。”","“Mynheer Cornelius, I have lots of things to do.”"
"“可我只有一件事。”科尔内留斯喃喃地说。","“And I have only one,” muttered Cornelius."
"“是啊，”罗莎说，“就是爱你的郁金香。”","“Yes,” said Rosa, “to love your tulip.”"
"“是爱你，罗莎。”","“To love you, Rosa.”"
"罗莎摇摇头，接着又是一阵沉默。","Rosa shook her head, after which followed a pause."
"“呃，”科尔内留斯打破沉默，说，“罗莎，自然万物变化无穷。春天的花儿相继开放，争奇斗艳。刚刚亲抚了紫罗兰和桂竹香的蜜蜂，又马不停蹄地在金银花、玫瑰、茉莉和康乃馨丛中翩跹起舞，同样情真意切。”","“Well,”—Cornelius at last broke the silence,—“well, Rosa, everything changes in the realm of nature; the flowers of spring are succeeded by other flowers; and the bees, which so tenderly caressed the violets and the wall-flowers, will flutter with just as much love about the honey-suckles, the rose, the jessamine, and the carnation.”"
"“你说这话有什么用意？”罗莎问。","“What does all this mean?” asked Rosa."
"“你抛弃了我，罗莎小姐，又去另觅新欢了。你做得对，我不会抱怨什么。我有什么资格要求你的忠贞呢？”","“You have abandoned me, Miss Rosa, to seek your pleasure elsewhere.You have done well, and I will not complain.What claim have I to your fidelity?”"
"“我的忠贞！”罗莎大声说，眼眶里的泪水在打转儿，在科尔内留斯面前她不再掩饰自己的情感，任由珍珠般的泪儿顺着脸颊滚落，“我的忠贞！难道我对你不忠贞吗？”","“My fidelity!” Rosa exclaimed, with her eyes full of tears, and without caring any longer to hide from Cornelius this dew of pearls dropping on her cheeks, “my fidelity! have I not been faithful to you?”"
"“你抛弃我，让我在这里等死，这算忠贞吗？”","“Do you call it faithful to desert me, and to leave me here to die?”"
"“可是，科尔内留斯先生，”罗莎说，“只要能让你快乐的事，我哪一样没做？难道我没有全身心地照看你的郁金香吗？”","“But, Mynheer Cornelius,” said Rosa, “am I not doing everything for you that could give you pleasure? have I not devoted myself to your tulip?”"
"“你太残忍了，罗莎，你居然拿这世界上我唯一真正的快乐来责怪我。”","“You are bitter, Rosa, you reproach me with the only unalloyed pleasure which I have had in this world.”"
"“我没有责怪你什么，科尔内留斯先生，或许，也就是在布伊坦霍夫，当人们告诉我你即将被处死的时候，那种撕心裂肺的悲痛才会让我怪你。”","“I reproach you with nothing, Mynheer Cornelius, except, perhaps, with the intense grief which I felt when people came to tell me at the Buytenhof that you were about to be put to death.”"
"“罗莎，我的好姑娘，我爱郁金香让你不高兴了。”","“You are displeased, Rosa, my sweet girl, with my loving flowers.”"
"“你爱它们，我不会不高兴，科尔内留斯先生，只有当你爱它们比爱我多一些的时候，我才会伤心。”","“I am not displeased with your loving them, Mynheer Cornelius, only it makes me sad to think that you love them better than you do me.”"
"“哦！我亲爱的罗莎！你瞧一瞧我颤抖的双手和苍白的面孔，你听一听我狂乱的心跳。这都是为了你，我的爱人，而不是黑郁金香啊！不如毁了那球茎，碾碎那幼芽，尽管我习惯做那无邪的美梦，现在也扑灭它和煦的光芒吧，只要你爱我，罗莎！爱我吧，因为我深深地感到我只爱你。","“Oh, my dear, dear Rosa! look how my hands tremble; look at my pale cheek, hear how my heart beats.It is for you, my love, not for the black tulip.Destroy the bulb, destroy the germ of that flower, extinguish the gentle light of that innocent and delightful dream, to which I have accustomed myself; but love me, Rosa, love me; for I feel deeply that I love but you.”"
"“是啊，除郁金香外。”罗莎叹了口气，却不再因为害羞抽回栅栏间她温暖的双手，因为科尔内留斯正热切地吻着它们。","“Yes, after the black tulip,” sighed Rosa, who at last no longer coyly withdrew her warm hands from the grating, as Cornelius most affectionately kissed them."
"“你胜过一切，罗莎。”","“Above and before everything in this world, Rosa.”"
"“我可以相信你吗？”","“May I believe you?”"
"“就像你笃信自己的存在一样。”","“As you believe in your own existence.”"
"“就算如此吧，但爱我不应该太过束缚你。”","“Well, then, be it so; but loving me does not bind you too much.”"
"“遗憾的是，约束还不够多，倒是你啊，罗莎，你受到不少约束。”","“Unfortunately, it does not bind me more than I am bound; but it binds you, Rosa, you.”"
"“我受到什么约束？”","“To what?”"
"“首先，你不能嫁人。”","“First of all, not to marry.”"
"她笑了。","She smiled."
"“瞧瞧，这就是你的风格，”她说，“你这个暴君。你爱慕一个美人儿，对她朝思暮想。你被判了死刑，即使走向断头台的时候，还要把你最后的叹息献给她。现在你还要求可怜的我为你牺牲一切梦想和幸福。”","“That’s your way,” she said; “you are tyrants all of you.You worship a certain beauty, you think of nothing but her.Then you are condemned to death, and whilst walking to the scaffold, you devote to her your last sigh; and now you expect poor me to sacrifice to you all my dreams and my happiness.”"
"“可你说的美人儿是谁，罗莎？”科尔内留斯问，因为他实在想不出罗莎影射的女人可能会是谁。","“But who is the beauty you are talking of, Rosa?” said Cornelius, trying in vain to remember a woman to whom Rosa might possibly be alluding."
"“一个黑美人，纤腰，秀足，还有一颗高贵的头。我说的是你的花儿啊。”","“The dark beauty with a slender waist, small feet, and a noble head; in short, I am speaking of your flower.”"
"科尔内留斯笑了。","Cornelius smiled."
"“无论如何，那只是你假想的恋人，而根据你自己的讲述，即使不算那个多情的雅各布，你身边围着各种各样的小伙子，迫切地向你表达爱意呢。你还记得你跟我说过海牙的那些学生、军官和职员吗，罗莎？洛维斯坦因难道就没有职员、军官或学生吗？”","“That is an imaginary lady love, at all events; whereas, without counting that amorous Jacob, you by your own account are surrounded with all sorts of swains eager to make love to you.Do you remember Rosa, what you told me of the students, officers, and clerks of the Hague?Are there no clerks, officers, or students at Loewestein?”"
"“当然有，还有不少呢。”","“Indeed there are, and lots of them.”"
"“有人给你写信了？”","“Who write letters?”"
"“的确有人写。”","“They do write.”"
"“那么，现在你识字了——”","“And now, as you know how to read—”"
"尽管他只是一名可怜的犯人，要不是他，罗莎哪能读她收到的情书，想到此，科尔内留斯叹了口气。","Here Cornelius heaved a sigh at the thought, that, poor captive as he was, to him alone Rosa owed the faculty of reading the love-letters which she received."
"“对于此，”罗莎说，“我想说，我读那些写给我的信，审视给我写信的各个求爱者，我只是照你的意旨做。”","“As to that,” said Rosa, “I think that in reading the notes addressed to me, and passing the different swains in review who send them to me, I am only following your instructions.”"
"“怎么呢？我的意旨？”","“How so?My instructions?”"
"“是啊，你的意旨，先生。”罗莎说，这回轮到她叹气了，“你忘了你亲手写在科尔内留斯·德维特先生《圣经》上的遗嘱了吗？我可没忘记，现在我识字了，我每天要读好几遍。遗嘱里，你要我爱上并嫁给一个二十六岁到二十八岁的英俊小伙。我一直在张罗着找这样的年轻人，可我白天都耗在你的郁金香上，你必须让我把晚上空出来，我才能去找他啊。”","“Indeed, your instructions, sir,” said Rosa, sighing in her turn; “have you forgotten the will written by your hand on the Bible of Cornelius de Witt?I have not forgotten it; for now, as I know how to read, I read it every day over and over again.In that will you bid me to love and marry a handsome young man of twenty-six or eight years.I am on the look-out for that young man, and as the whole of my day is taken up with your tulip, you must needs leave me the evenings to find him.”"
"“可是，罗莎，立那份遗嘱是因为我以为我会离开这人世，感谢上天，我还活着。”","“But, Rosa, the will was made in the expectation of death, and, thanks to Heaven, I am still alive.”"
"“那好吧，我就不去找那个英俊的年轻人了，我还是上这儿来看你吧。”","“Well, then, I shall not be after the handsome young man, and I shall come to see you.”"
"“对啊！罗莎，就来这儿吧！上这儿来！”","“That’s it, Rosa, come! come!”"
"“不过我有一个条件。”","“Under one condition.”"
"“无论啥条件，我都答应你。”","“Granted beforehand!”"
"“三天之内不准提及黑郁金香。”","“That the black tulip shall not be mentioned for the next three days.”"
"“罗莎，只要你高兴，我可以永远不提。”","“It shall never be mentioned any more, if you wish it, Rosa.”"
"“不，不，”姑娘笑着说，“我才不要求你办不到的事。”","“No, no,” the damsel said, laughing, “I will not ask for impossibilities.”"
"罗莎说着，好像没有察觉到她那娇嫩的脸庞凑近了铁窗，凑得太近，科尔内留斯轻啄了一口。","And, saying this, she brought her fresh cheek, as if unconsciously, so near the iron grating, that Cornelius was able to touch it with his lips."
"罗莎轻轻叫了一声，却满是娇嗔，然后就消失不见了。","Rosa uttered a little scream, which, however, was full of love, and disappeared."
"第二十一章 第二个球茎","Chapter 21 The Second Bulb"
"这是个美好的夜晚，但第二天一整天更美好。","The night was a happy one, and the whole of the next day happier still."
"前几天，监狱阴暗沉闷，仿佛这名不幸的犯人背负了整个监狱的重荷。漆黑的墙，阴冷的空气，甚至连铁栅栏都像能阻断阳光一样。","During the last few days, the prison had been heavy, dark, and lowering, as it were, with all its weight on the unfortunate captive.Its walls were black, its air chilling, the iron bars seemed to exclude every ray of light."
"可是当科尔内留斯第二天早上醒来的时候，一缕清晨的阳光在铁栅栏上嬉戏；鸽子展开翅膀在天空盘旋，还有些鸽子在屋顶上或是仍紧闭的窗户跟前饱含深情地咕咕叫唤。","But when Cornelius awoke next morning, a beam of the morning sun was playing about those iron bars; pigeons were hovering about with outspread wings, whilst others were lovingly cooing on the roof or near the still closed window."
"科尔内留斯跑过去打开窗户；对他来说，生命、欢乐和自由随着阳光一道涌了进来，前几天还阴郁的牢房，现在被爱的光芒点亮了，熠熠生辉。","Cornelius ran to that window and opened it; it seemed to him as if new life, and joy, and liberty itself were entering with this sunbeam into his cell, which, so dreary of late, was now cheered and irradiated by the light of love."
"所以，当格里弗斯早上巡查的时候，发现他的犯人不再郁郁寡欢地躺在床上，而是站在窗前，唱着小曲。","When Gryphus, therefore, came to see his prisoner in the morning, he no longer found him morose and lying in bed, but standing at the window, and singing a little ditty."
"“啊呀！”监狱看守惊呼。","“Halloa!” exclaimed the jailer."
"“您今天早上好吗？”科尔内留斯问道。","“How are you this morning?” asked Cornelius."
"格里弗斯皱着眉看着他。","Gryphus looked at him with a scowl."
"“您的狗好吗？还有雅各布先生，还有美丽的罗莎，他们都好吗？”","“And how is the dog, and Master Jacob, and our pretty Rosa?”"
"格里弗斯咬牙切齿地说：","Gryphus ground his teeth, saying.—"
"“你的早饭。”","“Here is your breakfast.”"
"“谢谢，我的刻耳柏洛斯朋友，”犯人说，“你来得正是时候，我饿坏了。”","“Thank you, friend Cerberus,” said the prisoner; “you are just in time; I am very hungry.”"
"“哦！你饿了，是吗？”格里弗斯说。","“Oh! you are hungry, are you?” said Gryphus."
"“是啊，怎么，不可以吗？”范巴尔莱问。","“And why not?” asked Van Baerle."
"“看来你的阴谋诡计酝酿得不错啊。”格里弗斯说。","“The conspiracy seems to thrive,” remarked Gryphus."
"“什么阴谋诡计？”","“What conspiracy?”"
"“得啦，我清楚得很，学者先生。不过你还是老实点，我们会监视你的。”","“Very well, I know what I know, Master Scholar; just be quiet, we shall be on our guard.”"
"“监视吧，亲爱的格里弗斯，您尽管监视吧，我的阴谋，还有我本人，都完全听您的使唤。”","“Be on your guard, friend Gryphus; be on your guard as long as you please; my conspiracy, as well as my person, is entirely at your service.”"
"“那咱们中午见分晓。”","“We’ll see that at noon.”"
"说着，格里弗斯出去了。","Saying this, Gryphus went out."
"“中午见分晓？”科尔内留斯跟着念叨着，“他这话是什么意思？管他呢，咱们就等着钟敲十二下，中午见分晓吧。”","“At noon?” repeated Cornelius; “what does that mean?Well, let us wait until the clock strikes twelve, and we shall see.”"
"让科尔内留斯等到中午十二点根本不是什么难事，因为他已经在等着晚上九点的到来了。","It was very easy for Cornelius to wait for twelve at midday, as he was already waiting for nine at night."
"中午十二点，楼道里不仅传来格里弗斯的脚步声，还有三四个跟他一块儿来的士兵的步伐声。","It struck twelve, and there were heard on the staircase not only the steps of Gryphus, but also those of three or four soldiers, who were coming up with him."
"门开了。格里弗斯带着他的人进来了，又转身关上门。","The door opened.Gryphus entered, led his men in, and shut the door after them."
"“到了，现在给我搜！”","“There, now search!”"
"他们不仅搜了科尔内留斯的衣服口袋，还搜了身，结果一无所获。","They searched not only the pockets of Cornelius, but even his person; yet they found nothing."
"他们接着把床单、褥子和他床上的草垫都搜了个遍，还是什么都没发现。","They then searched the sheets, the mattress, and the straw mattress of his bed; and again they found nothing."
"这时，科尔内留斯暗自庆幸没有自己来保管那第三个球茎。即使他藏得再好，格里弗斯还是会把它搜出来的，下场会跟第一个球茎一样。","Now, Cornelius rejoiced that he had not taken the third sucker under his own care.Gryphus would have been sure to ferret it out in the search, and would then have treated it as he did the first."
"还没有哪个犯人在搜查牢房的时候，还有科尔内留斯那付自鸣得意的神情。","And certainly never did prisoner look with greater complacency at a search made in his cell than Cornelius."
"格里弗斯拿着罗莎给范巴尔莱的一支铅笔和两三张白纸离开了，这是这次出征的唯一战利品。","Gryphus retired with the pencil and the two or three leaves of white paper which Rosa had given to Van Baerle, this was the only trophy brought back from the expedition."
"六点的时候，格里弗斯又来了，不过这次是一个人。科尔内留斯本想劝劝他，可格里弗斯却咆哮着，露出嘴角的一颗獠牙似的大牙，他一步步倒退了出去，像是担心有人从后面偷袭他似的。","At six Gryphus came back again, but alone; Cornelius tried to propitiate him, but Gryphus growled, showed a large tooth like a tusk, which he had in the corner of his mouth, and went out backwards, like a man who is afraid of being attacked from behind."
"科尔内留斯禁不住笑了出来，格里弗斯听到了笑声，隔着铁窗嚷嚷着：","Cornelius burst out laughing, to which Gryphus answered through the grating,—"
"“看谁是真正的赢家，看谁笑到最后。”","“Let him laugh that wins.”"
"那天的胜利者是科尔内留斯。罗莎九点来了。","The winner that day was Cornelius; Rosa came at nine."
"这次她没有拿灯。她不再需要灯了，因为现在她能识字了。另外，拿着灯可能会暴露她的行踪，最近雅各布总是跟着她，看得比以前更紧了。最后一点是，有了灯，罗莎不胜娇羞的面庞总是一览无遗。","She was without a lantern.She needed no longer a light, as she could now read.Moreover, the light might betray her, as Jacob was dogging her steps more than ever.And lastly, the light would have shown her blushes."
"这对年轻人晚上都说了点什么呢？他们谈论的事情无外乎是，法国恋人们在门口说的，西班牙恋人从阳台到街头说的，或者东方的恋人们从露台到花园里说的那些情话。","Of what did the young people speak that evening?Of those matters of which lovers speak at the house doors in France, or from a balcony into the street in Spain, or down from a terrace into a garden in the East."
"他们谈论的那些事情仿佛给时间插上了翅膀；他们什么都说，唯一没有提到的就是黑郁金香。","They spoke of those things which give wings to the hours; they spoke of everything except the black tulip."
"终于到了十点，他们像往常一样互道晚安。","At last, when the clock struck ten, they parted as usual."
"科尔内留斯很开心，虽然不跟一个郁金香迷谈及他的郁金香，这样的快乐会大打折扣，可他还是挺开心的。","Cornelius was happy, as thoroughly happy as a tulip-fancier would be to whom one has not spoken of his tulip."
"他发现罗莎漂亮、善良、优雅而迷人。","He found Rosa pretty, good, graceful, and charming."
"可为什么罗莎对谈论郁金香如此反感呢？","But why did Rosa object to the tulip being spoken of?"
"这真是罗莎的一大缺点。","This was indeed a great defect in Rosa."
"科尔内留斯叹了口气，自己承认，女人总没有完美的。","Cornelius confessed to himself, sighing, that woman was not perfect."
"那个晚上，有一段时间，他想着这点瑕疵，也就是说，他醒着就一直想着罗莎。","Part of the night he thought of this imperfection; that is to say, so long as he was awake he thought of Rosa."
"就是睡着了，他还梦见了罗莎。","After having fallen asleep, he dreamed of her."
"可他梦境里的罗莎要远比现实生活中的罗莎完美。梦境里的罗莎不仅谈及了郁金香，还给他拿来一朵插在瓷花瓶里的黑郁金香。","But the Rosa of his dreams was by far more perfect than the Rosa of real life.Not only did the Rosa of his dreams speak of the tulip, but also brought to him a black one in a china vase."
"科尔内留斯跟着就醒了，乐得浑身颤抖，嘴里还嘟哝着：","Cornelius then awoke, trembling with joy, and muttering,—"
"“罗莎，罗莎，我爱你。”","“Rosa, Rosa, I love you.”"
"天亮了，他想还是别再睡了，于是他顺着他刚睡醒时的思路，自己又在那儿天马行空起来。","And as it was already day, he thought it right not to fall asleep again, and he continued following up the line of thought in which his mind was engaged when he awoke."
"啊！要是罗莎能谈谈郁金香，科尔内留斯情愿要她，也不愿娶塞米勒米司女王、克里奥帕特拉女王、伊丽莎白女王，还有奥地利的安娜王后，就是说哪怕是世界上最伟大或最美丽的女王，他都不要。","Ah! if Rosa had only conversed about the tulip, Cornelius would have preferred her to Queen Semiramis, to Queen Cleopatra, to Queen Elizabeth, to Queen Anne of Austria; that is to say, to the greatest or most beautiful queens whom the world has seen."
"可是罗莎已经下了禁令，至少三天内不能提郁金香，否则她就不来了。诚然，这意味着他给了恋人七十二小时。可这么一来，这位园艺家好像被偷了七十二小时。","But Rosa had forbidden it under pain of not returning; Rosa had forbidden the least mention of the tulip for three days.That meant seventy-two hours given to the lover to be sure; but it was seventy-two hours stolen from the horticulturist."
"不过还有一点值得欣慰：七十二小时内，罗莎不允许提及郁金香，现在已经过去三十六小时了。余下的三十六小时会过得很快：用十八小时期待晚上的会面，还有十八小时用来沉浸于回忆的喜悦。","There was one consolation: of the seventy-two hours during which Rosa would not allow the tulip to be mentioned, thirty-six had passed already; and the remaining thirty-six would pass quickly enough: eighteen with waiting for the evening’s interview, and eighteen with rejoicing in its remembrance."
"罗莎在老时间来了，科尔内留斯勇敢地承受着被迫对郁金香缄口不谈的痛苦。","Rosa came at the same hour, and Cornelius submitted most heroically to the pangs which the compulsory silence concerning the tulip gave him."
"然而，他美丽的访客深知人们要在这点上发号施令，就得在其他方面顺从。因此她不再试图从窗洞里抽回自己的双手，甚至任由科尔内留斯温柔地亲吻她美丽的金色长发。","His fair visitor, however, was well aware that, to command on the one point, people must yield on another; she therefore no longer drew back her hands from the grating, and even allowed Cornelius tenderly to kiss her beautiful golden tresses."
"可怜的姑娘！她不知道这些恋人间的小把戏比谈论郁金香还要危险。可当她脸红心跳、嘴唇发干，眼睛湿润地回到自己的房间时，她才意识到这点。","Poor girl! she had no idea that these playful little lovers’ tricks were much more dangerous than speaking of the tulip was; but she became aware of the fact as she returned with a beating heart, with glowing cheeks, dry lips, and moist eyes."
"第二天晚上，互相寒暄了几句后，她瞅着他往后退了一步，那表情要是他看见了定会满心的欢喜。","And on the following evening, after the first exchange of salutations, she retired a step, looking at him with a glance, the expression of which would have rejoiced his heart could he but have seen it."
"“呃，”她说，“她出来了。”","“Well,” she said, “she is up.”"
"“她出来了？谁啊？你说什么？”科尔内留斯问，他不敢相信罗莎会主动缩减对他的考察期限。","“She is up!Who?What?” asked Cornelius, who did not venture on a belief that Rosa would, of her own accord, have abridged the term of his probation."
"“她！哎呀，我的女儿，郁金香。”罗莎说。","“She?Well, my daughter, the tulip,” said Rosa."
"“什么！”科尔内留斯叫道，“这么说，你允许我谈论郁金香了？”","“What!” cried Cornelius, “you give me permission, then?”"
"“是的，”罗莎说，那语气就像一位慈母满足自己孩子的愿望一样。","“I do,” said Rosa, with the tone of an affectionate mother who grants a pleasure to her child."
"“啊，罗莎！”科尔内留斯说着，把嘴唇凑近铁栅栏，希望能碰到脸蛋、手，或者前额，总之，任何地方都行。","“Ah, Rosa!” said Cornelius, putting his lips to the grating with the hope of touching a cheek, a hand, a forehead,—anything, in short."
"他碰到的比这些还要好——温润半启的双唇。","He touched something much better,—two warm and half open lips."
"罗莎轻轻叫了一声。","Rosa uttered a slight scream."
"科尔内留斯明白他该赶紧继续他们的谈话。他料到这突如其来的吻一定吓坏了罗莎。","Cornelius understood that he must make haste to continue the conversation.He guessed that this unexpected kiss had frightened Rosa."
"“它长得直吗？”","“Is it growing up straight?”"
"“跟火箭一样直。”罗莎说。","“Straight as a rocket,” said Rosa."
"“有多高？”","“How high?”"
"“至少有两英寸。”","“At least two inches.”"
"“哦！罗莎，好好照顾它，我们就会看到它长得有多快。”","“Oh, Rosa, take good care of it, and we shall soon see it grow quickly.”"
"“我照顾它照顾得还不够好吗？”她说，“老实说，我每天就只想着郁金香了。”","“Can I take more care of it?” said she.“Indeed, I think of nothing else but the tulip.”"
"“就没想点别的，罗莎？唷，现在轮到我心生嫉妒了。”","“Of nothing else, Rosa?Why, now I shall grow jealous in my turn.”"
"“哎呀，你也知道我想郁金香就是想你，我的目光可从来没有离开过它。我醒来在床上第一眼看到的东西就是它，入睡前最后看到的也是它。白天我坐在它旁边干活，自从我把它搁在房间里以后，我就没离开过。”","“Oh, you know that to think of the tulip is to think of you; I never lose sight of it.I see it from my bed, on awaking it is the first object that meets my eyes, and on falling asleep the last on which they rest.During the day I sit and work by its side, for I have never left my chamber since I put it there.”"
"“你做得对，罗莎，你知道，那是你的嫁妆。”","“You are right Rosa, it is your dowry, you know.”"
"“是啊，我要带着它嫁给一个我爱的二十六岁到二十八岁的年轻人。”","“Yes, and with it I may marry a young man of twenty-six or twenty-eight years, whom I shall be in love with.”"
"“别这么说，你这顽皮的丫头。”","“Don’t talk in that way, you naughty girl.”"
"那天晚上，科尔内留斯是最幸福的人之一。罗莎让他握着她的手，他想握多久就握多久，此外，他还能尽情谈论他的郁金香。","That evening Cornelius was one of the happiest of men.Rosa allowed him to press her hand in his, and to keep it as long as he would, besides which he might talk of his tulip as much as he liked."
"从那一刻起，每一天都记录着郁金香的成长和两个年轻人的感情历程。","From that hour every day marked some progress in the growth of the tulip and in the affection of the two young people."
"有一次，叶子舒展开了，还有一次，花苞冒出来了。","At one time it was that the leaves had expanded, and at another that the flower itself had formed."
"科尔内留斯听到此消息高兴坏了，他的问题像连珠炮似的一个接着一个，由此看出，这些消息对他来说有多重要。","Great was the joy of Cornelius at this news, and his questions succeeded one another with a rapidity which gave proof of their importance."
"“冒出花苞了！”科尔内留斯惊呼，“真的冒出花苞了？”","“Formed!” exclaimed Cornelius, “is it really formed?”"
"“是的。”罗莎又重复了一遍。","“It is,” repeated Rosa."
"科尔内留斯乐得浑身发抖，他不得不抓紧了铁栅栏。","Cornelius trembled with joy, so much so that he was obliged to hold by the grating."
"“我的上帝啊！”他大声说。","“Good heavens!” he exclaimed."
"然后，他转过身，继续问罗莎：","Then, turning again to Rosa, he continued his questions."
"“椭圆形规则吗？圆柱体饱满吗？瓣尖儿很绿吗？”","“Is the oval regular? the cylinder full? and are the points very green?”"
"“椭圆型差不多有一英寸长，而且顶部细得像针，圆柱体侧部已经膨胀起来，瓣尖儿也要开了。”","“The oval is almost one inch long, and tapers like a needle, the cylinder swells at the sides, and the points are ready to open.”"
"两天后，罗莎宣布瓣尖儿已经开了。","Two days after Rosa announced that they were open."
"“开了，罗莎！”科尔内留斯叫道。“总苞开了吗？那是不是已经可以分辨出——”","“Open, Rosa!” cried Cornelius.“Is the involucrum open? but then one may see and already distinguish—”"
"这时犯人不说话了，他有些喘不过气来。","Here the prisoner paused, anxiously taking breath."
"“是的。”罗莎回答，“已经可以辨认出一线不同的颜色，就跟头发丝一样细。”","“Yes,” answered Rosa, “one may already distinguish a thread of different colour, as thin as a hair.”"
"“那是什么颜色？”科尔内留斯哆嗦着问。","“And its colour?” asked Cornelius, trembling."
"“哦！”罗莎回答，“颜色很深！”","“Oh,” answered Rosa, “it is very dark!”"
"“褐色？”","“Brown?”"
"“比那还要深。”","“Darker than that.”"
"“还要深，我的好罗莎，还要深？谢谢你。深得跟——”","“Darker, my good Rosa, darker?Thank you.Dark as—”"
"“深得跟我写信给你的墨汁一样。”","“Dark as the ink with which I wrote to you.”"
"科尔内留斯欣喜若狂地大叫一声。","Cornelius uttered a cry of mad joy."
"随后，他突然停下来，双手交握，说：","Then, suddenly stopping and clasping his hands, he said,—"
"“啊！即使天堂也没有哪个天使能和你媲美，罗莎！”","“Oh, there is not an angel in heaven that may be compared to you, Rosa!”"
"“那还用说！”罗莎看他如此激动，微笑着说。","“Indeed!” said Rosa, smiling at his enthusiasm."
"“罗莎，你是在满腔热情地工作，你为我做了太多！罗莎，我的郁金香要开花了，它会开出黑色的花儿！罗莎！罗莎！你是世上最完美的人！”","“Rosa, you have worked with such ardour,—you have done so much for me!Rosa, my tulip is about to flower, and it will flower black!Rosa, Rosa, you are the most perfect being on earth!”"
"“不过，除郁金香外。”","“After the tulip, though.”"
"“啊！别说了，你这个小捣蛋鬼，别说了！你够坏的啊！别扫了我的兴致。不过，告诉我，罗莎，郁金香到现在这个程度，最晚再有两三天就要开花了吧？”","“Ah! be quiet, you malicious little creature, be quiet!For shame!Do not spoil my pleasure.But tell me, Rosa,—as the tulip is so far advanced, it will flower in two or three days, at the latest?”"
"“明天，或是后天。”","“To-morrow, or the day after.”"
"“啊！我不能看见它，”科尔内留斯边往后退，边喊，“我也不能吻它，就像吻上帝的杰作，就像你碰巧凑近铁窗时，我吻你的手，吻你的面庞那样吻它，罗莎。”","“Ah! and I shall not see it,” cried Cornelius, starting back, “I shall not kiss it, as a wonderful work of the Almighty, as I kiss your hand and your cheek, Rosa, when by chance they are near the grating.”"
"罗莎把脸凑了过去，这次不是偶然，而是她有意这样的，科尔内留斯温柔地吻着她。","Rosa drew near, not by accident, but intentionally, and Cornelius kissed her tenderly."
"“哎呀，如果你愿意的话，我把它摘下来吧。”","“Faith, I shall cull it, if you wish it.”"
"“啊，不，不，罗莎！花开后，你把它小心安置在阴凉处，然后马上写信给哈勒姆园艺协会的主席，告诉他大黑郁金香已经开了。我知道哈勒姆挺远的，不过你可以拿钱雇个信使。你有钱吗，罗莎？”","“Oh, no, no, Rosa! when it is open, place it carefully in the shade, and immediately send a message to Haarlem, to the President of the Horticultural Society, that the grand black tulip is in flower.I know well it is far to Haarlem, but with money you will find a messenger.Have you any money, Rosa?”"
"罗莎微笑着。","Rosa smiled."
"“有，我有钱！”她说。","“Oh, yes!” she said."
"“钱够吗？”科尔内留斯说。","“Enough?” said Cornelius."
"“我有三百基尔德。”","“I have three hundred guilders.”"
"“哎呀，如果你有三百基尔德，你就不要叫信使去了，罗莎，你亲自去趟哈勒姆。”","“Oh, if you have three hundred guilders, you must not send a messenger, Rosa, but you must go to Haarlem yourself.”"
"“我走的这段时间，花怎么办？”","“But what in the meantime is to become of the flower?”"
"“是噢，花！你得带着它一起去。你要明白，你一刻都不能和它分开。”","“Oh, the flower! you must take it with you.You understand that you must not separate from it for an instant.”"
"“可我不和它分开，就得和你分开啊，科尔内留斯先生。”","“But whilst I am not separating from it, I am separating from you, Mynheer Cornelius.”"
"“啊！没错，我可爱的罗莎。唉！上帝啊！人类多么邪恶啊！我做了什么得罪了他们，他们凭什么剥夺我的自由啊？你说得对，罗莎，我不能没有你。这样吧，你派个人去哈勒姆，就这么定了。这么件大喜事，主席一定会不辞辛劳过来的。他会亲自到洛维斯坦因看看黑郁金香的。”","“Ah! that’s true, my sweet Rosa.Oh, my God! how wicked men are!What have I done to offend them, and why have they deprived me of my liberty?You are right, Rosa, I cannot live without you.Well, you will send some one to Haarlem,—that’s settled; really, the matter is wonderful enough for the President to put himself to some trouble.He will come himself to Loewestein to see the tulip.”"
"接着，他突然克制了一下自己的情绪，吞吞吐吐地说：","Then, suddenly checking himself, he said, with a faltering voice,—"
"“罗莎，罗莎，要是最后开出的花不是黑的，可该怎么办啊！”","“Rosa, Rosa, if after all it should not flower black!”"
"“哎呀！不会的，不会的，你明天，或者后天就知道了。”","“Oh, surely, surely, you will know to-morrow, or the day after.”"
"“要等到晚上才知道，罗莎！到时候我会急死的。咱们是不是要商量个暗号？”","“And to wait until evening to know it, Rosa!I shall die with impatience.Could we not agree about a signal?”"
"“我有个更好的办法。”","“I shall do better than that.”"
"“你有什么办法？”","“What will you do?”"
"“如果是晚上开的，我就亲自来告诉你。如果是白天，我会趁我爸爸第一次和第二次巡查的空隙，从你门前过，从门缝底下或者窗洞塞张纸条。”","“If it opens at night, I shall come and tell you myself.If it is day, I shall pass your door, and slip you a note either under the door, or through the grating, during the time between my father’s first and second inspection.”"
"“好吧，罗莎，就这么办。从你那儿得到这消息，真是双重幸福啊。”","“Yes, Rosa, let it be so.One word of yours, announcing this news to me, will be a double happiness.”"
"“瞧，十点了。”罗莎说，“我得走了。”","“There, ten o’clock strikes,” said Rosa, “I must now leave you.”"
"“是啊，是啊。”科尔内留斯说，“走吧，罗莎，走吧！”","“Yes, yes,” said Cornelius, “go, Rosa, go!”"
"罗莎有些沮丧地离开了，因为科尔内留斯像是赶着她走。","Rosa withdrew, almost melancholy, for Cornelius had all but sent her away."
"没错，他这么做是希望她能守着他的黑郁金香。","It is true that he did so in order that she might watch over his black tulip."
"第二十二章 花开了","Chapter 22 The Opening of the Flower"
"尽管科尔内留斯一晚上坐立不安，不过他内心倒是很甜蜜。他时时刻刻都仿佛出现幻觉，听到罗莎在温柔地唤他。于是他起身来到门口，隔着铁窗往外望，结果没人在外面，厅堂也是空空如也。","The night passed away very sweetly for Cornelius, although in great agitation.Every instant he fancied he heard the gentle voice of Rosa calling him.He then started up, went to the door, and looked through the grating, but no one was behind it, and the lobby was empty."
"毫无疑问，罗莎此时也在守候，不过她要开心多了，因为她守候的是郁金香，晃在她眼前的是朵高贵的花儿，是奇迹中的奇迹，是迄今为止，不为人知，甚至被认为是不可能的奇迹。","Rosa, no doubt, would be watching too, but, happier than he, she watched over the tulip; she had before her eyes that noble flower, that wonder of wonders, which not only was unknown, but was not even thought possible until then."
"要是世人听说发现了黑郁金香，黑郁金香不仅存在，而且是犯人范巴尔莱发现的，他们会作何反响？","What would the world say when it heard that the black tulip was found, that it existed and that it was the prisoner Van Baerle who had found it?"
"就算有人拿让他恢复自由为条件来换他的郁金香，他也会断然拒绝的。　","How Cornelius would have spurned the offer of his liberty in exchange for his tulip!"
"天亮了，还是一点儿消息都没有，郁金香还没有开花。","Day came, without any news; the tulip was not yet in flower."
"白天同夜晚一样悄无声息地过去了。夜幕降临了，接着罗莎来了，欢呼雀跃得像只小鸟。","The day passed as the night.Night came, and with it Rosa, joyous and cheerful as a bird."
"“怎样了？”科尔内留斯问。","“Well?” asked Cornelius."
"“哎呀，一切都好。今天晚上，咱们的郁金香一定会开花。”","“Well, all is going on prosperously.This night, without any doubt, our tulip will be in flower.”"
"“会开出黑色的花吗？” ","“And will it flower black?”"
"“会跟煤玉一样黑。”","“Black as jet.”"
"“没有一个杂色斑点。”","“Without a speck of any other colour.”"
"“一个斑点都没有。”","“Without one speck.”"
"“上帝啊！亲爱的罗莎，我做了一晚上的梦，最先梦到的就是你，”（罗莎做了个手势，表示她不相信他的话，）“然后才梦到我们应该做的事。”","“Good Heavens! my dear Rosa, I have been dreaming all night, in the first place of you,” (Rosa made a sign of incredulity,) “and then of what we must do.”"
"“怎么了？”","“Well?”"
"“呃，我来告诉你，我是这样决定的。一旦郁金香开花了，而且很肯定的是，花儿是不带一点杂色的黑色，你就去找个信使。”","“Well, and I will tell you now what I have decided on.The tulip once being in flower, and it being quite certain that it is perfectly black, you must find a messenger.”"
"“如果就只是这事，那我已经找好信使了。”","“If it is no more than that, I have a messenger quite ready.”"
"“这人可靠吗？”","“Is he safe?”"
"“我可以为他担保，他是我的一个情人。”","“One for whom I will answer,—he is one of my lovers.”"
"“我希望不是雅各布。”","“I hope not Jacob.”"
"“不是，你就放心好了，我找的那个人是洛维斯坦因的船夫，一个二十五岁，聪明能干的小伙子。”","“No, be quiet, it is the ferryman of Loewestein, a smart young man of twenty-five.”"
"“啊，我的神啊！”","“By Jove!”"
"“放心吧，”罗莎笑着说，“他还没到年龄呢，不是你自己把年龄限定在二十六岁到二十八岁的嘛。”","“Be quiet,” said Rosa, smiling, “he is still under age, as you have yourself fixed it from twenty-six to twenty-eight.”"
"“总而言之，你觉得这个人年轻人可以信赖吗？”","“In fine, do you think you may rely on this young man?”"
"“就像信赖我自己一样；如果我叫他投河，他会立马蹦进瓦尔河或是马斯河。”","“As on myself; he would throw himself into the Waal or the Meuse if I bade him.”"
"“好啦，罗莎，这个小伙子到哈勒姆要十小时。给我纸和铅笔，不过，或许最好用钢笔和墨水，我来写，嗯，这样吧，罗莎，你来写吧，我一个犯人，人们也许会像你爸爸一样，认为我在搞什么阴谋。你写信给园艺协会的主席，我敢肯定他会来的。”","“Well, Rosa, this lad may be at Haarlem in ten hours; you will give me paper and pencil, and, perhaps better still, pen and ink, and I will write, or rather, on second thoughts, you will, for if I did, being a poor prisoner, people might, like your father, see a conspiracy in it.You will write to the President of the Horticultural Society, and I am sure he will come.”"
"“可要是他耽搁了呢？”","“But if he tarries?”"
"“那咱们就假设他会耽搁一天，或者甚至两天，但这是不太可能的。像他那样的郁金香迷，别说是一小时，哪怕是一分一秒都不会耽搁，他会立马动身来看这世界第八大奇迹。不过，就算像我刚才所说，他要耽搁一两天，郁金香还是会开得正艳呢。一旦主席看见花儿了，并起草了证书，一切都已成定局。你要保存证书的副本，并把郁金香托付给他。啊！要是我们能亲自把它送过去，罗莎，除非是交给你，要不我会一直捧着它，不撒手。可这只是个梦，一个我们不该做的梦。”科尔内留斯叹了口气，继续说，“它会在陌生人的注视下慢慢凋谢。最重要的是，罗莎，在主席见到这花儿之前，不要让任何人看到。哎呀！要是谁看见了黑郁金香，一定会把它偷走的。”","“Well, let us suppose that he tarries one day, or even two; but it is impossible.A tulip-fancier like him will not tarry one hour, not one minute, not one second, to set out to see the eighth wonder of the world.But, as I said, if he tarried one or even two days, the tulip will still be in its full splendour.The flower once being seen by the President, and the protocol being drawn up, all is in order; you will only keep a duplicate of the protocol, and intrust the tulip to him.Ah! if we had been able to carry it ourselves, Rosa, it would never have left my hands but to pass into yours; but this is a dream, which we must not entertain,” continued Cornelius with a sigh, “the eyes of strangers will see it flower to the last.And above all, Rosa, before the President has seen it, let it not be seen by any one.Alas! if any one saw the black tulip, it would be stolen.”"
"“哦！”","“Oh!”"
"“你不是自己也跟我说过，你担心你的情人雅各布心怀鬼胎吗？一个基尔德都有人偷，更别说是十万基尔德了！”","“Did you not tell me yourself of what you apprehended from your lover Jacob?People will steal one guilder, why not a hundred thousand?”"
"“放心吧，我会守着的。”","“I shall watch; be quiet.”"
"“可要是你在这儿的时候，花开了呢？”","“But if it opened whilst you were here?”"
"“这个变化莫测的小东西倒真可能使这小把戏呢。”罗莎说。","“The whimsical little thing would indeed be quite capable of playing such a trick,” said Rosa."
"“要是你回去的时候发现它已经开了呢？”","“And if on your return you find it open?”"
"“那怎么办啊？”","“Well?”"
"“噢！罗莎，甭管它什么时候开，你要记住，要赶紧通知主席，一刻都不能耽误。”","“Oh, Rosa, whenever it opens, remember that not a moment must be lost in apprising the President.”"
"“还要赶紧通知你。行了，我知道了。”","“And in apprising you.Yes, I understand.”"
"罗莎叹了口气，不过这次没有一丝苦涩，倒像是一个开始了解对方弱点，并逐渐适应的女人。","Rosa sighed, yet without any bitter feeling, but rather like a woman who begins to understand a foible, and to accustom herself to it."
"“我回去看着你的郁金香了，范巴尔莱先生，花一开，我就给你报信，你一得到消息，信使就动身。”","“I return to your tulip, Mynheer van Baerle, and as soon as it opens I will give you news, which being done the messenger will set out immediately.”"
"“罗莎，罗莎，我真不知道该把你比作天底下哪一样奇迹啊！”","“Rosa, Rosa, I don’t know to what wonder under the sun I shall compare you.”"
"“把我比作黑郁金香吧，我敢向你保证，我会受宠若惊的。那晚安了，咱们只有等到下次见了，科尔内留斯先生。”","“Compare me to the black tulip, and I promise you I shall feel very much flattered.Good night, then, till we meet again, Mynheer Cornelius.”"
"“唉！那你说‘晚安，我的朋友。’”","“Oh, say ‘Good night, my friend.’”"
"“晚安，我的朋友。”罗莎说，心里得到了些许安慰。","“Good night, my friend,” said Rosa, a little consoled."
"“说，‘我最心爱的朋友。’”","“Say, ‘My very dear friend.’”"
"“哦！我的朋友——”","“Oh, my friend—”"
"“最心爱的朋友，我求求你，说‘最心爱的’，罗莎，最心爱的。”","“Very dear friend, I entreat you, say ‘very dear,’ Rosa, very dear.”"
"“最心爱的，好吧，最心爱的。”罗莎说得心怦怦直跳，幸福得忘乎所以了。","“Very dear, yes, very dear,” said Rosa, with a beating heart, beyond herself with happiness."
"“既然你说了‘最心爱的’，亲爱的罗莎，那你再说‘最幸福’吧，说‘天底下最幸福快乐的’。我只缺了一样东西，罗莎。”","“And now that you have said ‘very dear,’ dear Rosa, say also ‘most happy’: say ‘happier and more blessed than ever man was under the sun.’I only lack one thing, Rosa.”"
"“是什么？”","“And that is?”"
"“你的脸庞，你娇嫩的脸庞，你柔软红润的脸庞。唉！罗莎，你要是愿意你就主动给我，我不要偶然的。啊！”","“Your cheek,—your fresh cheek, your soft, rosy cheek.Oh, Rosa, give it me of your own free will, and not by chance. Ah!”"
"犯人的祈求化作了一声欣喜的惊叹，他的嘴唇碰到了姑娘的嘴唇——不是偶然，也不是精心策划，而像一百年后圣普洛碰到朱莉的嘴唇一样。","The prisoner’s prayer ended in a sigh of ecstasy; his lips met those of the maiden,—not by chance, nor by stratagem, but as Saint-Preux’s was to meet the lips of Julie a hundred years later."
"罗莎落荒而逃。","Rosa made her escape."
"科尔内留斯站在那里，整颗心陶醉在罗莎的吻中，脸紧贴着门柱。","Cornelius stood with his heart upon his lips, and his face glued to the wicket in the door."
"幸福与喜悦简直让他喘不过气来。他打开窗户，带着一颗澎湃的心久久地凝视着无云的苍穹，月亮荡漾在从远山蜿蜒流淌而来的小溪里，泛着银色的光芒。他充分呼吸着那纯净清甜的空气，脑子却沉浸在幸福的思绪里，内心里充满感激和宗教狂热。","He was fairly choking with happiness and joy.He opened his window, and gazed long, with swelling heart, at the cloudless vault of heaven, and the moon, which shone like silver upon the two-fold stream flowing from far beyond the hills.He filled his lungs with the pure, sweet air, while his brain dwelt upon thoughts of happiness, and his heart overflowed with gratitude and religious fervour."
"“啊！您总是高高在上，俯视苍生，我的上帝，”他大声说，半匍匐着，目光炯炯地盯着星星，“原谅我前几天曾质疑过您的存在，因为您把脸藏在云后，一度从我的视线里消失，啊，仁慈的上帝，善良的圣父，永恒的圣父！可今天，就在今天晚上，今天夜里，我在您天国的镜子里，重见您奇妙的光芒，特别是在我那颗充满感激之心的镜子里，看得尤为清晰。”","“Oh Thou art always watching from on high, my God,” he cried, half prostrate, his glowing eyes fixed upon the stars: “forgive me that I almost doubted Thy existence during these latter days, for Thou didst hide Thy face behind the clouds, and wert for a moment lost to my sight, O Thou merciful God, Thou pitying Father everlasting!But to-day, this evening, and to-night, again I see Thee in all Thy wondrous glory in the mirror of Thy heavenly abode, and more clearly still in the mirror of my grateful heart.”"
"这个可怜的病人已经康复了；这个不幸的犯人又自由了。","He was well again, the poor invalid; the wretched captive was free once more."
"那晚上，有一段时间，科尔内留斯满心欢喜地呆在窗户边，凝望着星星，听着万籁之声。","During part of the night Cornelius, with his heart full of joy and delight, remained at his window, gazing at the stars, and listening for every sound."
"他时不时把目光投向厅堂那边：","Then casting a glance from time to time towards the lobby,—"
"“在那儿，”他说，“罗莎就在那儿，像我一样守望，一分钟一分钟地等待。在那儿，在罗莎眼前的是朵奇葩，它在那儿扎根，生长，开花，或许此刻郁金香的花茎正在罗莎纤细的指间。轻抚它，罗莎。或许她正用她的双唇亲吻半开的花萼。小心地触碰它，罗莎，你的嘴唇太炽热。是啊，或许此刻，我的两个心爱之物正在上帝的注视之下爱抚着对方。”","“Down there,” he said, “is Rosa, watching like myself, and waiting from minute to minute; down there, under Rosa’s eyes, is the mysterious flower, which lives, which expands, which opens, perhaps Rosa holds in this moment the stem of the tulip between her delicate fingers.Touch it gently, Rosa.Perhaps she touches with her lips its expanding chalice.Touch it cautiously, Rosa, your lips are burning.Yes, perhaps at this moment the two objects of my dearest love caress each other under the eye of Heaven.”"
"这时，南边天空的一颗星星发出耀眼的光芒，划过整个天际，最后仿佛陨落在洛维斯坦因监狱。","At this moment, a star blazed in the southern sky, and shot through the whole horizon, falling down, as it were, on the fortress of Loewestein."
"科尔内留斯顿时浑身一激灵。","Cornelius felt a thrill run through his frame."
"“啊！”他说，“是上帝给我的花赋予了灵魂。”","“Ah!” he said, “here is Heaven sending a soul to my flower.”"
"仿佛真叫他说中了，也就在这个时候，犯人听到厅堂里传来精灵般轻盈的脚步声，裙袍摩擦的窸窣声，还有那熟悉的声音轻唤着他：","And as if he had guessed correctly, nearly at that very moment the prisoner heard in the lobby a step light as that of a sylph, and the rustling of a gown, and a well-known voice, which said to him,—"
"“科尔内留斯，我的朋友，我最亲爱的朋友，我最幸福的朋友，来，快来！”","“Cornelius, my friend, my very dear friend, and very happy friend, come, come quickly.”"
"科尔内留斯一个箭步从窗户飞奔到门前，他的嘴唇碰到了罗莎的嘴唇，她边吻边对他说：","Cornelius darted with one spring from the window to the door, his lips met those of Rosa, who told him, with a kiss,—"
"“花开了，是黑色的，瞧，在这儿。”","“It is open, it is black, here it is.”"
"“什么！在这儿？”科尔内留斯叫道。","“How! here it is?” exclaimed Cornelius."
"“是啊，是啊，要给你一个惊喜，我们总该冒点风险吧。在这儿，拿着。”","“Yes, yes, we ought indeed to run some little risk to give a great joy; here it is, take it.”"
"她一只手把一盏刚点燃的暗灯举到与窗洞平行的高度，另一只手把那朵神奇的郁金香举到同样的高度。","And with one hand she raised to the level of the grating a dark lantern, which she had lit in the meanwhile, whilst with the other she held to the same height the miraculous tulip."
"科尔内留斯叫了一声，几乎昏厥过去。","Cornelius uttered a cry, and was nearly fainting."
"“啊！”他嘟哝着，“我的上帝，我的上帝啊！您在报偿我的清白和囚禁生活啊，因为您让这两朵花盛放在我监狱的窗洞口！”","“Oh!” muttered he, “my God, my God, Thou dost reward me for my innocence and my captivity, as Thou hast allowed two such flowers to grow at the grated window of my prison!”"
"郁金香美丽、绚烂、高贵。花茎有十八寸高。花儿从四片像铁矛一样光滑笔直的绿叶中伸展出来，整朵花儿像煤玉一样乌黑发亮。","The tulip was beautiful, splendid, magnificent; its stem was more than eighteen inches high; it rose from out of four green leaves, which were as smooth and straight as iron lance-heads; the whole of the flower was as black and shining as jet."
"“罗莎，”科尔内留斯几乎喘不过气来，说，“罗莎，一刻都不要耽误，赶紧写信。”","“Rosa,” said Cornelius, almost gasping, “Rosa, there is not one moment to lose in writing the letter.”"
"“信已经写好了，我心爱的科尔内留斯。”罗莎说。","“It is written, my dearest Cornelius,” said Rosa."
"“就写好了？”","“Is it, indeed?”"
"“郁金香花开的时候我就自己写了，我一分钟都不想耽误。你瞧瞧这信，有什么不妥的，告诉我。”","“Whilst the tulip opened I wrote it myself, for I did not wish to lose a moment.Here is the letter, and tell me whether you approve of it.”"
"科尔内留斯接过信来一看，字迹与上次他收到罗莎字条时相比，又进步了许多，信的内容如下：","Cornelius took the letter, and read, in a handwriting which was much improved even since the last little note he had received from Rosa, as follows:—"
"“主席先生，黑郁金香就要开了，大概十分钟之内就会开了。它一开，我就派人给您送信，请您亲自来一趟洛维斯坦因监狱，取走黑郁金香。我是监狱看守格里弗斯的女儿，我没有自由，跟我父亲手下的犯人没什么两样。所以，我不能把这朵神奇的花儿带给您。这也是我请您亲自来取它的原因。","“Mynheer President,—The black tulip is about to open, perhaps in ten minutes.As soon as it is open, I shall send a messenger to you, with the request that you will come and fetch it in person from the fortress at Loewestein.I am the daughter of the jailer, Gryphus, almost as much of a captive as the prisoners of my father.I cannot, therefore, bring to you this wonderful flower.This is the reason why I beg you to come and fetch it yourself."
"“我希望这朵花能被命名为‘罗莎巴尔莱’。","“It is my wish that it should be called Rosa Barlaensis."
"“花开了，完全是黑色的。来吧。主席先生，快来吧。","“It has opened; it is perfectly black; come, Mynheer President, come."
"“您卑微的奴婢，","“I have the honour to be your humble servant,"
"“罗莎·格里弗斯。","“Rosa Gryphus."
"“就是这么写的，亲爱的罗莎，就是这么写的。你的信写得好极了！要我来写，都没你写得简洁明了。等委员会问及你所有信息的时候，你再告诉他们。到时候他们就知道郁金香是怎么培植的，你为它付出了多少心血，度过了多少不眠之夜。但现在咱们一刻都不要耽误。信使！去交给信使！”","“That’s it, dear Rosa, that’s it.Your letter is admirable!I could not have written it with such beautiful simplicity.You will give to the committee all the information that will be required of you.They will then know how the tulip has been grown, how much care and anxiety, and how many sleepless nights, it has cost.But for the present not a minute must be lost.The messenger! the messenger!”"
"“主席的姓名？”","“What’s the name of the President?”"
"“把信给我，我来写姓名和地址。哦！他可是很有名气的范西斯当先生，哈勒姆市市长。把信给我，罗莎，把信给我。”","“Give me the letter, I will direct it.Oh, he is very well known: it is Mynheer van Systens, the burgomaster of Haarlem; give it to me, Rosa, give it to me.”"
"科尔内留斯用颤抖的手写下了地址：","And with a trembling hand Cornelius wrote the address,—"
"“彼得·范西斯当先生，哈勒姆市市长兼哈勒姆园艺协会主席亲启。”","“To Mynheer Peter van Systens, Burgomaster, and President of the Horticultural Society of Haarlem.”"
"“好了，罗莎，快去，快去，”科尔内留斯说，“让我们祈求上帝的庇护，直到现在，仁慈的上帝都一直守护着我们。”","“And now, Rosa, go, go,” said Cornelius, “and let us implore the protection of God, who has so kindly watched over us until now.”"
"第二十三章 死对头","Chapter 23 The Rival"
"事实上，这对可怜的年轻人确实很需要上帝的庇护。","And in fact the poor young people were in great need of protection."
"此刻，希望即将化为泡影，而他们自己还以为成功已经唾手可得了呢。","They had never been so near the destruction of their hopes as at this moment, when they thought themselves certain of their fulfilment."
"想必读者早已认出雅各布就是我们的老朋友，更确切地说，是我们的宿敌伊萨克·博克斯戴尔，毫无疑问，大家也猜出这个能人千里迢迢从布伊坦霍夫来到洛维斯坦因，是在追寻他的所爱与所恨——黑郁金香和科尔内留斯·范巴尔莱的足迹。","The reader cannot but have recognized in Jacob our old friend, or rather enemy, Isaac Boxtel, and has guessed, no doubt, that this worthy had followed from the Buytenhof to Loewestein the object of his love and the object of his hatred,—the black tulip and Cornelius van Baerle."
"没有人会发现球茎的存在和犯人的辛勤努力，除了郁金香迷，尤其是一个满怀嫉妒的郁金香迷，是嫉妒心让博克斯戴尔发现了这些秘密，就算不是他发现的，至少也是猜到的。","What no one but a tulip-fancier, and an envious tulip-fancier, could have discovered,—the existence of the bulbs and the endeavours of the prisoner,—jealousy had enabled Boxtel, if not to discover, at least to guess."
"我们也看到，他叫雅各布后比用伊萨克这名字时成功得多。他赢得了格里弗斯的友谊，这可是他几个月来，用从特塞尔到安特卫普一带提取出来的最好的杜松子酒培养出来的。他还跟格里弗斯提出他想娶罗莎，极尽谄媚之能事，以此打消多疑的监狱看守的猜疑。","We have seen him, more successful under the name of Jacob than under that of Isaac, gain the friendship of Gryphus, which for several months he cultivated by means of the best Genievre ever distilled from the Texel to Antwerp, and he lulled the suspicion of the jealous turnkey by holding out to him the flattering prospect of his designing to marry Rosa."
"除了以求婚为诱饵来恭维这位父亲的雄心之外，与此同时，他还激发他作为监狱看守的热忱，用最恶毒的语言跟格里弗斯描述他手下博学的犯人，用雅各布的话说，科尔内留斯是和撒旦一伙的，是来祸害奥兰治亲王殿下的。","Besides thus offering a bait to the ambition of the father, he managed, at the same time, to interest his zeal as a jailer, picturing to him in the blackest colours the learned prisoner whom Gryphus had in his keeping, and who, as the sham Jacob had it, was in league with Satan, to the detriment of his Highness the Prince of Orange."
"一开始他还与罗莎套近乎，倒不是为了博得她的好感，而是因为他想通过与她谈婚论嫁，躲避可能会引起的怀疑和猜忌。","At first he had also made some way with Rosa; not, indeed, in her affections, but inasmuch as, by talking to her of marriage and of love, he had evaded all the suspicions which he might otherwise have excited."
"我们前面也看到他跟着罗莎到了花园，这一鲁莽的举动完全暴露了自己在年轻姑娘眼中的真面目，科尔内留斯出于本能的恐惧，让罗莎和黑郁金香这两位情人严加提防着他。","We have seen how his imprudence in following Rosa into the garden had unmasked him in the eyes of the young damsel, and how the instinctive fears of Cornelius had put the two lovers on their guard against him."
"读者一定记得，雅各布因为格里弗斯踩碎了第一个球茎大发雷霆，这事尤其让犯人不安。当时，尽管博克斯戴尔怀疑科尔内留斯还有第二个球茎，可他又不能肯定，因此他更加气急败坏。","The reader will remember that the first cause of uneasiness was given to the prisoner by the rage of Jacob when Gryphus crushed the first bulb.In that moment Boxtel’s exasperation was the more fierce, as, though suspecting that Cornelius possessed a second bulb, he by no means felt sure of it."
"从那一刻起，他就开始跟踪罗莎，不管她是去花园还是大厅。","From that moment he began to dog the steps of Rosa, not only following her to the garden, but also to the lobbies."
"不过，就像这次一样，他晚上光着脚跟踪她，所以既没有被看见，也没被听见，只有一次，罗莎看见楼道上好像有个人影。","Only as this time he followed her in the night, and bare-footed, he was neither seen nor heard except once, when Rosa thought she saw something like a shadow on the staircase."
"但是她发现得太迟了，因为博克斯戴尔已经亲耳从犯人嘴里听到还有第二个球茎。","Her discovery, however, was made too late, as Boxtel had heard from the mouth of the prisoner himself that a second bulb existed."
"罗莎假装把球茎埋进土里，他中了她的计后，他心里清楚罗莎耍这把戏就是要逼着他暴露自己的身份，从此，他加倍小心，用尽他那狡猾的天性所能想出的一切办法，监视别人而不被人发觉。","Taken in by the stratagem of Rosa, who had feigned to put it in the ground, and entertaining no doubt that this little farce had been played in order to force him to betray himself, he redoubled his precaution, and employed every means suggested by his crafty nature to watch the others without being watched himself."
"他看见罗莎从她爸爸的厨房里抱出一个大白陶花盆，拿到自己的卧房里。他看见罗莎在水桶里洗她漂亮的小手，那手上的污垢像是她摆弄了泥土，因为她要尽可能地给郁金香提供最好的土壤。","He saw Rosa conveying a large flower-pot of white earthenware from her father’s kitchen to her bedroom.He saw Rosa washing in pails of water her pretty little hands, begrimed as they were with the mould which she had handled, to give her tulip the best soil possible."
"最后他租了间正对着罗莎窗户的阁楼，距离远得用肉眼根本没法认出他，可他借助望远镜，距离就足够近了，他可以把洛维斯坦因罗莎房间里发生的一切看得一清二楚，就像当初他在多特监视科尔内留斯的干燥室一样。","And at last he hired, just opposite Rosa’s window, a little attic, distant enough not to allow him to be recognized with the naked eye, but sufficiently near to enable him, with the help of his telescope, to watch everything that was going on at the Loewestein in Rosa’s room, just as at Dort he had watched the dry-room of Cornelius."
"他搬进阁楼还不到三天，所有的疑虑就都消除了。","He had not been installed more than three days in his attic before all his doubts were removed."
"从早晨到日落，花盆都在窗口，而罗莎，就像米埃里斯和梅苏画框里的迷人女性一样，出现在野葡萄嫩芽和金银花新枝围绕的窗户边上。","From morning to sunset the flower-pot was in the window, and, like those charming female figures of Mieris and Metzys, Rosa appeared at that window as in a frame, formed by the first budding sprays of the wild vine and the honeysuckle encircling her window."
"罗莎饶有兴致地注视着花盆，那眼神向博克斯戴尔泄露了花盆里东西的真正价值。　　","Rosa watched the flower-pot with an interest which betrayed to Boxtel the real value of the object enclosed in it."
"除了第二个球茎，那东西不可能是别的什么，也就是说，那是犯人所有希望的精髓。","This object could not be anything else but the second bulb, that is to say, the quintessence of all the hopes of the prisoner."
"晚上寒气逼人，罗莎就把花盆搬了进去。","When the nights threatened to be too cold, Rosa took in the flower-pot."
"很明显，这是科尔内留斯叫她这么做的，他担心霜冻冻坏了他的球茎。","Well, it was then quite evident she was following the instructions of Cornelius, who was afraid of the bulb being killed by frost."
"早上十一点到下午两点正是太阳最热的时候，罗莎也会把花盆搬进去。","When the sun became too hot, Rosa likewise took in the pot from eleven in the morning until two in the afternoon."
"这是另一个证据——科尔内留斯担心土壤变得太干燥。","Another proof: Cornelius was afraid lest the soil should become too dry."
"可新叶破土而出的时候，博克斯戴尔已经完全确信了。叶子还没长到一寸高的时候，他就从望远镜里看得一清二楚，不再有任何疑虑了。","But when the first leaves peeped out of the earth Boxtel was fully convinced; and his telescope left him no longer in any uncertainty before they had grown one inch in height."
"科尔内留斯有两个球茎，第二个球茎托付给了罗莎来悉心爱护照看。","Cornelius possessed two bulbs, and the second was intrusted to the love and care of Rosa."
"我们完全能够想象，这对恋人间温情脉脉的秘密没逃出博克斯戴尔窥探的好奇心。","For it may well be imagined that the tender secret of the two lovers had not escaped the prying curiosity of Boxtel."
"因此，问题是如何把第二个球茎从罗莎的悉心照顾中夺过来。","The question, therefore, was how to wrest the second bulb from the care of Rosa."
"这当然不是件容易的事。","Certainly this was no easy task."
"罗莎守护着郁金香，就像妈妈守护着自己孩子，或者鸽子守着自己的蛋一样。","Rosa watched over her tulip as a mother over her child, or a dove over her eggs."
"罗莎白天从不离开自己的房间，不仅如此，说也奇怪，后来她连晚上也不离开了。","Rosa never left her room during the day, and, more than that, strange to say, she never left it in the evening."
"博克斯戴尔一连七天监视罗莎都白忙活了，她一直坚守自己的岗位。","For seven days Boxtel in vain watched Rosa; she was always at her post."
"那是在科尔内留斯极不开心的七天，这几天里他同时失去了罗莎和他郁金香的一切消息。","This happened during those seven days which made Cornelius so unhappy, depriving him at the same time of all news of Rosa and of his tulip."
"罗莎和科尔内留斯之间会永远冷漠下去吗？","Would the coolness between Rosa and Cornelius last for ever?"
"这样的话，盗窃郁金香就要比伊萨克先生起初预计的难多了。","This would have made the theft much more difficult than Mynheer Isaac had at first expected."
"我们说盗窃，是因为伊萨克已经决定去偷郁金香，这花儿是非常秘密地培植的，而且，作为知名的郁金香培植者，无论什么时候人们都会相信他的话，而不会相信一个没有任何园艺知识的普通女孩的话，更不会相信一个犯了叛国罪的犯人的话。他信心十足地以为，只要弄到了球茎，他一定会得奖，而且这郁金香也不会叫‘巴尔莱氏黑郁金香’，而是以‘博克斯戴尔氏黑郁金香’或者‘博克斯戴尔’之名流芳百世。","We say the theft, for Isaac had simply made up his mind to steal the tulip; and as it grew in the most profound secrecy, and as, moreover, his word, being that of a renowned tulip-grower, would any day be taken against that of an unknown girl without any knowledge of horticulture, or against that of a prisoner convicted of high treason, he confidently hoped that, having once got possession of the bulb, he would be certain to obtain the prize; and then the tulip, instead of being called Tulipa nigra Barlaensis, would go down to posterity under the name of Tulipa nigra Boxtellensis or Boxtellea."
"伊萨克先生还没想好，这两个名字到底用哪一个来命名郁金香，不过既然这两个名字意思是一样的，这就不是什么关键问题了。","Mynheer Isaac had not yet quite decided which of these two names he would give to the tulip, but, as both meant the same thing, this was, after all, not the important point."
"关键问题是偷到郁金香。可是博克斯戴尔要能偷到郁金香，罗莎就一定得离开她的房间。","The point was to steal the tulip.But in order that Boxtel might steal the tulip, it was necessary that Rosa should leave her room."
"所以，当他看到这对恋人又开始每晚的约会时，他高兴坏了。","Great therefore was his joy when he saw the usual evening meetings of the lovers resumed."
"他首先利用罗莎不在的时间，充分熟悉她房间门的所有特性。锁是好的，还可以反锁，而且罗莎总是随身带着钥匙。","He first of all took advantage of Rosa’s absence to make himself fully acquainted with all the peculiarities of the door of her chamber.The lock was a double one and in good order, but Rosa always took the key with her."
"博克斯戴尔起先想去偷钥匙，可他立马想到，从罗莎的口袋里拿到钥匙本来就不是件容易的事，而且，当她发觉自己丢了钥匙，她一定要等换了锁才肯离开房间的，这样的话，博克斯戴尔之前的钥匙就白偷了。","Boxtel at first entertained an idea of stealing the key, but it soon occurred to him, not only that it would be exceedingly difficult to abstract it from her pocket, but also that, when she perceived her loss, she would not leave her room until the lock was changed, and then Boxtel’s first theft would be useless."
"所以，他想最好还是采用别的办法。他尽可能多的找来些钥匙，就每天趁着罗莎和科尔内留斯在牢房窗洞度过的那愉快的一小时的空儿，把每一把钥匙都试过了。　","He thought it, therefore, better to employ a different expedient.He collected as many keys as he could, and tried all of them during one of those delightful hours which Rosa and Cornelius passed together at the grating of the cell."
"有两把钥匙能插到锁里，其中一把能转一圈，但第二圈就转不动了。","Two of the keys entered the lock, and one of them turned round once, but not the second time."
"这么说，这把钥匙只要稍作修改就可以了。","There was, therefore, only a little to be done to this key."
"博克斯戴尔把钥匙裹了一层薄蜡，这样，当他再次试验的时候，阻碍钥匙转第二圈的地方就会在蜡上留下印记。","Boxtel covered it with a slight coat of wax, and when he thus renewed the experiment, the obstacle which prevented the key from being turned a second time left its impression on the wax."
"博克斯戴尔花了两天多的功夫才用一把小锉刀把这把钥匙打造得完全合用了。","It cost Boxtel two days more to bring his key to perfection, with the aid of a small file."
"这样，博克斯戴尔悄无声息、毫不费力地就打开了罗莎的房门，他发现房间里就只有他和郁金香了。","Rosa’s door thus opened without noise and without difficulty, and Boxtel found himself in her room alone with the tulip."
"博克斯戴尔的第一次罪行是他翻墙想挖走黑郁金香；第二次是从一个开着的窗户爬进科尔内留斯的干燥室；第三次就是用一把伪造的钥匙进了罗莎的房间。","The first guilty act of Boxtel had been to climb over a wall in order to dig up the tulip; the second, to introduce himself into the dry-room of Cornelius, through an open window; and the third, to enter Rosa’s room by means of a false key."
"如此，是嫉妒驱使着博克斯戴尔在犯罪道路上快步向前。","Thus envy urged Boxtel on with rapid steps in the career of crime."
"正如我们前面讲到的，博克斯戴尔独自一人和郁金香在一起。","Boxtel, as we have said, was alone with the tulip."
"一般小偷会把花盆往胳膊底下一夹，把它带走。","A common thief would have taken the pot under his arm, and carried it off."
"可博克斯戴尔不是一般的小偷，他在那儿寻思呢。","But Boxtel was not a common thief, and he reflected."
"虽然很有可能，但也不能完全肯定这郁金香会开出黑色的花；因此，如果他现在偷了它，他不仅可能白偷了，而且等待花儿开放的那段时间里，这场盗窃迟早会被人发现。","It was not yet certain, although very probable, that the tulip would flower black; if, therefore, he stole it now, he not only might be committing a useless crime, but also the theft might be discovered in the time which must elapse until the flower should open."
"反正他有钥匙，他什么时候想进罗莎的房间都可以，所以，他觉得最好等到花开前或后一个小时，再把花拿走也不迟，然后立马动身去哈勒姆，在其他任何人提出收回要求前，把郁金香展示给委员会所有的评委。","He therefore—as being in possession of the key, he might enter Rosa’s chamber whenever he liked—thought it better to wait and to take it either an hour before or after opening, and to start on the instant to Haarlem, where the tulip would be before the judges of the committee before any one else could put in a reclamation."
"要是那时候有人要收回这花，博克斯戴尔就会倒打一耙，告他们盗窃。","Should any one then reclaim it, Boxtel would in his turn charge him or her with theft."
"这可真是老谋深算啊，真不愧是这样的人想出来的。","This was a deep-laid scheme, and quite worthy of its author."
"于是，每个晚上，当两个恋人在窗洞那里一起度过愉快的一个钟头的时候，博克斯戴尔就来到罗莎的房间，看看黑郁金香开花的进展情况。","Thus, every evening during that delightful hour which the two lovers passed together at the grated window, Boxtel entered Rosa’s chamber to watch the progress which the black tulip had made towards flowering."
"我们前面讲到的那个晚上，他本来打算像往常一样进房间的，可这对恋人，我们也看到，说了没几句话，科尔内留斯就打发罗莎回去守着郁金香。","On the evening at which we have arrived he was going to enter according to custom; but the two lovers, as we have seen, only exchanged a few words before Cornelius sent Rosa back to watch over the tulip."
"看到罗莎才离开了十分钟，就又回到了房间，博克斯戴尔猜到郁金香已经开了，或者快要开了。","Seeing Rosa enter her room ten minutes after she had left it, Boxtel guessed that the tulip had opened, or was about to open."
"因此，就在那个晚上，他开始了致命行动。博克斯戴尔亲自给格里弗斯奉上了是平时两倍多的杜松子酒，就是说，给他每个口袋塞了一瓶。","During that night, therefore, the great blow was to be struck.Boxtel presented himself before Gryphus with a double supply of Genievre, that is to say, with a bottle in each pocket."
"格里弗斯被灌醉了，博克斯戴尔差不多就是屋里的主人了。","Gryphus being once fuddled, Boxtel was very nearly master of the house."
"十一点钟，格里弗斯已经醉得不省人事。凌晨两点，博克斯戴尔看见罗莎离开房间，而且很明显，她胳膊下面藏着什么东西，拿的时候还小心翼翼的。","At eleven o’clock Gryphus was dead drunk.At two in the morning Boxtel saw Rosa leaving the chamber; but evidently she held in her arms something which she carried with great care."
"他很清楚，那东西就是已经开了花的黑郁金香。","He did not doubt that this was the black tulip which was in flower."
"可她拿着花儿做什么？难道她要带着花马上动身去哈勒姆吗？","But what was she going to do with it?Would she set out that instant to Haarlem with it?"
"一个年轻女孩晚上一个人跑这么远的路，这也不太可能啊。","It was not possible that a young girl should undertake such a journey alone during the night."
"难道她只是把郁金香拿给科尔内留斯看看吗？这个倒很有可能。","Was she only going to show the tulip to Cornelius?This was more likely."
"他穿着袜子，踮着脚，跟在罗莎的后面。","He followed Rosa in his stocking feet, walking on tiptoe."
"他看见她走到窗洞跟前。他听见她叫科尔内留斯。借着暗灯的灯光，他看见郁金香开了，那花儿就跟掩护自己的夜色一样黑。","He saw her approach the grated window.He heard her calling Cornelius.By the light of the dark lantern he saw the tulip open, and black as the night in which he was hidden."
"他听到科尔内留斯和罗莎商定着要派信使去哈勒姆。他看见这对恋人的嘴唇碰到一起，然后科尔内留斯让罗莎离开了。","He heard the plan concerted between Cornelius and Rosa to send a messenger to Haarlem.He saw the lips of the lovers meet, and then heard Cornelius send Rosa away."
"他看见罗莎灭了灯，回到自己的房间。十分钟后，他看见她又离开房间，转了两圈钥匙，锁上了门。　","He saw Rosa extinguish the light and return to her chamber.Ten minutes after, he saw her leave the room again, and lock it twice."
"所有的这一切都是博克斯戴尔藏在上一层楼楼梯口看到的，罗莎从她那层楼每下一步，他就从他那层下一步。这样，当罗莎轻轻地踏上楼梯的最后一级台阶时，博克斯戴尔已经悄无声息地来到了罗莎房间的门口，手伸向了房门锁。","Boxtel, who saw all this whilst hiding himself on the landing-place of the staircase above, descended step by step from his story as Rosa descended from hers; so that, when she touched with her light foot the lowest step of the staircase, Boxtel touched with a still lighter hand the lock of Rosa’s chamber."
"大家很清楚，就在那只手里，他攥着他配的一把钥匙，那钥匙开起罗莎的房门来丝毫不比原来的钥匙含糊。","And in that hand, it must be understood, he held the false key which opened Rosa’s door as easily as did the real one."
"这也就是我们在这章开头说，这对可怜的年轻人非常需要上帝庇护的原因了。","And this is why, in the beginning of the chapter, we said that the poor young people were in great need of the protection of God."
"第二十四章 黑郁金香易主","Chapter 24 The Black Tulip Changes Masters"
"罗莎走后，科尔内留斯就一直站在原地没动。他无法承载他的双重幸福带给他的生命之重。","Cornelius remained standing on the spot where Rosa had left him.He was quite overpowered with the weight of his twofold happiness."
"半小时过去了。第一缕阳光已经照进监狱的铁栅栏了，楼道里突然传来脚步声和越来越近的叫唤声，把科尔内留斯吓了一跳。","Half an hour passed away.Already did the first rays of the sun enter through the iron grating of the prison, when Cornelius was suddenly startled at the noise of steps which came up the staircase, and of cries which approached nearer and nearer."
"几乎就在同一时间，他看见眼前的罗莎，面色苍白，一脸的惊慌失措。","Almost at the same instant he saw before him the pale and distracted face of Rosa."
"他很吃惊，脸也吓得惨白。","He started, and turned pale with fright."
"“科尔内留斯，科尔内留斯！”她叫道，喘不过气来。","“Cornelius, Cornelius!” she screamed, gasping for breath."
"“我的上帝啊！到底怎么了？”犯人问。","“Good Heaven! what is it?” asked the prisoner."
"“科尔内留斯！郁金香——”","“Cornelius! the tulip—”"
"“怎么了？”","“Well?”"
"“我怎么跟你说呢？”","“How shall I tell you?”"
"“快说，快说，罗莎！”","“Speak, speak, Rosa!”"
"“有人拿走，不，是有人偷走了郁金香。”","“Some one has taken—stolen it from us.”"
"“偷走了？拿走了？”科尔内留斯说。","“Stolen—taken?” said Cornelius."
"“是的，”罗莎说，她的腿有些发软，倚着门站着，“是的，被拿走了，被偷了！”","“Yes,” said Rosa, leaning against the door to support herself; “yes, taken, stolen!”"
"说着，她感到四肢无力，跪倒在地上。","And saying this, she felt her limbs failing her, and she fell on her knees."
"“可怎么会这样呢？告诉我，快解释给我听。”","“But how?Tell me, explain to me.”"
"“哎！这不是我的错，我的朋友。”","“Oh, it is not my fault, my friend.”"
"可怜的罗莎！她现在都不敢再叫他“我心爱的”了。","Poor Rosa! she no longer dared to call him “My beloved one.”"
"“你是不是把它单独留在那儿了？”科尔内留斯懊悔地说。","“You have then left it alone,” said Cornelius, ruefully."
"“我就离开了一会儿，我去找咱们的信使了，他就住在瓦尔河边，离这儿不到五十码的距离。”","“One minute only, to instruct our messenger, who lives scarcely fifty yards off, on the banks of the Waal.”"
"“那就是在那会儿被偷了，我叮嘱你多少次了，你怎么还是把钥匙忘了，不幸的孩子！”","“And during that time, notwithstanding all my injunctions, you left the key behind, unfortunate child!”"
"“不，不，不！这正是我想不通的地方。钥匙从来没离开过我的手，我一直把它攥在手里，唯恐它长了翅膀飞了。”","“No, no, no! this is what I cannot understand.The key was never out of my hands; I clinched it as if I were afraid it would take wings.”"
"“可这到底是怎么回事呢？”","“But how did it happen, then?”"
"“这点我也想不明白。我把信交给了信使，他一出发我就走了，回到家，门还是锁着的，房间里的一切跟我离开的时候一模一样，就只有郁金香不见了。一定有人有我房间的钥匙，或者他专门配了一把。”","“That’s what I cannot make out.I had given the letter to my messenger; he started before I left his house; I came home, and my door was locked, everything in my room was as I had left it, except the tulip,—that was gone.Some one must have had a key for my room, or have got a false one made on purpose.”"
"她几乎泣不成声，没办法说下去了。","She was nearly choking with sobs, and was unable to continue."
"科尔内留斯一脸的惊愕，一动也不动，他仿佛没听明白似的，喃喃自语道：","Cornelius, immovable and full of consternation, heard almost without understanding, and only muttered,—"
"“被偷了，被偷了，我完了！”","“Stolen, stolen, and I am lost!”"
"“啊！科尔内留斯，原谅我吧，原谅我吧，还不如让我死了算了！”","“O Cornelius, forgive me, forgive me, it will kill me!”"
"科尔内留斯看到罗莎这么痛苦，他抓着窗洞的铁栅栏，猛烈地摇晃着，喊道：","Seeing Rosa’s distress, Cornelius seized the iron bars of the grating, and furiously shaking them, called out,—"
"“罗莎，罗莎，郁金香被偷了，这是事实，可难道咱们就要因此绝望吗？不，不，就算是天大的不幸，也能有补救的办法。罗莎，我们认识那贼！”","“Rosa, Rosa, we have been robbed, it is true, but shall we allow ourselves to be dejected for all that?No, no; the misfortune is great, but it may perhaps be remedied.Rosa, we know the thief!”"
"“哎呀！可我怎么能肯定呢？”","“Alas! what can I say about it?”"
"“可我敢说，除了那个无耻的雅各布，就不会是别人。难道我们就眼睁睁地让他拿着我们的劳动果实去哈勒姆吗？我们度过了多少个不眠之夜才收获了它，它可是我们爱情的结晶啊！罗莎，我们得去追，我们要赶上他！”","“But I say that it is no one else but that infamous Jacob.Shall we allow him to carry to Haarlem the fruit of our labour, the fruit of our sleepless nights, the child of our love?Rosa, we must pursue, we must overtake him!”"
"“可是，我的朋友，我们要怎么做这一切，才能不被我爸爸发现，这是我们俩商量好了的呢？我一个弱女子，不谙世事，我怎么才能达到或许连你自己都没法达到的目的呢？”","“But how can we do all this, my friend, without letting my father know we were in communication with each other?How should I, a poor girl, with so little knowledge of the world and its ways, be able to attain this end, which perhaps you could not attain yourself?”"
"“罗莎，罗莎，你把门给我打开，你看看我能不能抓到这贼，我能不能让他供认不讳，跪地求饶。”","“Rosa, Rosa, open this door to me, and you will see whether I will not find the thief,—whether I will not make him confess his crime and beg for mercy.”"
"“哎呀！”罗莎呜咽地说道，“我怎么给你开门啊？我哪儿有钥匙啊？如果我有钥匙，你不早就自由了吗？”","“Alas!” cried Rosa, sobbing, “can I open the door for you? have I the keys?If I had had them, would not you have been free long ago?”"
"“你爸爸有钥匙，你那该死的爸爸，已经把我第一个郁金香球茎给毁了。哦，这混蛋！他就是雅各布的同谋！”","“Your father has them,—your wicked father, who has already crushed the first bulb of my tulip.Oh, the wretch! he is an accomplice of Jacob!”"
"“别说这么大声，看在上帝的份上！”","“Don’t speak so loud, for Heaven’s sake!”"
"“哦，罗莎，如果你不把门给我打开，”科尔内留斯愤怒地咆哮着，“我就把门撞开，把监狱里的人杀他个干净！”","“Oh, Rosa, if you don’t open the door to me,” Cornelius cried in his rage, “I shall force these bars, and kill everything I find in the prison.”"
"“求你宽恕，求你宽恕，我的朋友！”","“Be merciful, be merciful, my friend!”"
"“我告诉你，罗莎，我要毁了这座监狱，一块儿石头都不留！”这个不幸的人因为愤怒，力量增加了十倍，他开始哐啷哐啷地摇门，根本不理会雷鸣般的响声回荡在螺旋梯上。","“I tell you, Rosa, that I shall demolish this prison, stone for stone!” and the unfortunate man, whose strength was increased tenfold by his rage, began to shake the door with a great noise, little heeding that the thunder of his voice was re-echoing through the spiral staircase."
"受了惊吓的罗莎一再想平息这场急风骤雨般的怒火，可都是徒劳。","Rosa, in her fright, made vain attempts to check this furious outbreak."
"“我告诉你，我要杀了那个无耻的格里弗斯。”科尔内留斯咆哮着，“我告诉你，我要让他血液四溅，就像他对待我的黑郁金香一样。”","“I tell you that I shall kill that infamous Gryphus.” roared Cornelius.“I tell you I shall shed his blood as he did that of my black tulip.”"
"这个不幸的犯人真的开始歇斯底里了。","The wretched prisoner began really to rave."
"“那好吧。”罗莎声音颤抖地说，“好吧，好吧，只要你安静点。好吧，好吧，我去拿钥匙，我给你开门！好吧，只要你安静点，我亲爱的科尔内留斯。”","“Well, then, yes,” said Rosa, all in a tremble.“Yes, yes, only be quiet.Yes, yes, I will take his keys, I will open the door for you!Yes, only be quiet, my own dear Cornelius.”"
"她话还没说完，身边一个恶狠狠的声音打断了她。","She did not finish her speech, as a growl by her side interrupted her."
"“爸爸！”罗莎叫道。","“My father!” cried Rosa."
"“格里弗斯！”范巴尔莱咆哮着。“啊！你这个混蛋！”","“Gryphus!” roared Van Baerle.“Oh, you villain!”"
"吵闹声中，老格里弗斯上楼，他们都没有听到。","Old Gryphus, in the midst of all the noise, had ascended the staircase without being heard."
"他一把抓住了罗莎的手腕。","He rudely seized his daughter by the wrist."
"“这么说你要拿我的钥匙？”他气得差点说不出话来。“啊！这个卑鄙的家伙，这个恶魔，这个该被绞死的阴谋家，是你亲爱的科尔内留斯，是吗？啊！小姑娘和国家政治犯还有交往。啊！这不是我教你的，对吧？”","“So you will take my keys?” he said, in a voice choked with rage.“Ah! this dastardly fellow, this monster, this gallows-bird of a conspirator, is your own dear Cornelius, is he?Ah! Missy has communications with prisoners of state.Ah! won’t I teach you—won’t I?”"
"罗莎绝望地扣紧双手。","Rosa clasped her hands in despair."
"“啊！”格里弗斯继续说道，不过语气已经由疯狂的愤怒转为与敌人交手占上风时的冷嘲热讽，“啊！你这个无辜的郁金香爱好者，你这个温文而雅的学者，你要杀了我，喝我的血！很好！很好！你还让我的女儿成了你的同谋。难道我掉进了贼窝子里了，土匪洞里了？没错，不过省长先生明天就全知道了，后天总督殿下就知道了。我们懂法，我们再上演一次布伊坦霍夫那一幕，学者先生，不过这次可有好戏看了。好吧，好吧，你就像笼子里的熊一样，好好啃啃你的爪子吧，至于你，我的小美人儿，好好瞅瞅你亲爱的科尔内留斯。我告诉你们，我的小羊羔，你们不会再有串通一气的乐趣了。滚开，你这不孝的女儿！而你，学者先生，咱们还会见面的。放心好了，咱们会再见面的。”","“Ah!” Gryphus continued, passing from the madness of anger to the cool irony of a man who has got the better of his enemy,—“Ah, you innocent tulip-fancier, you gentle scholar; you will kill me, and drink my blood!Very well! very well!And you have my daughter for an accomplice.Am I, forsooth, in a den of thieves,—in a cave of brigands?Yes, but the Governor shall know all to-morrow, and his Highness the Stadtholder the day after.We know the law,—we shall give a second edition of the Buytenhof, Master Scholar, and a good one this time.Yes, yes, just gnaw your paws like a bear in his cage, and you, my fine little lady, devour your dear Cornelius with your eyes.I tell you, my lambkins, you shall not much longer have the felicity of conspiring together.Away with you, unnatural daughter!And as to you, Master Scholar, we shall see each other again.Just be quiet,—we shall.”"
"恐惧与绝望一齐袭来，罗莎不知所措，她给了她朋友一个飞吻。然后，忽然灵光一闪，她想到一个好主意，她边冲向楼梯，边说：","Rosa, beyond herself with terror and despair, kissed her hands to her friend; then, suddenly struck with a bright thought, she rushed toward the staircase, saying,—"
"“咱们还有办法，科尔内留斯。你就看我的吧，我的科尔内留斯。”","“All is not yet lost, Cornelius.Rely on me, my Cornelius.”"
"她爸爸跟在她后面，咆哮着走了。","Her father followed her, growling."
"而可怜的科尔内留斯，他的手指还一直痉挛般地紧握着栅栏，此刻他慢慢松开了手。他头发沉，眼发胀，重重地倒在他牢房的地上，嘴里还喃喃地说：","As to poor Cornelius, he gradually loosened his hold of the bars, which his fingers still grasped convulsively.His head was heavy, his eyes almost started from their sockets, and he fell heavily on the floor of his cell, muttering,—"
"“被偷了！它被偷走了！”","“Stolen! it has been stolen from me!”"
"就在这会儿，博克斯戴尔已经从罗莎亲自打开的大门离开了监狱。他把黑郁金香裹在斗篷里，在戈尔肯跳上一辆等候他的马车走了，我们可以想到，他突然离开可是不辞而别，也没跟他的朋友格里弗斯打声招呼。","During this time Boxtel had left the fortress by the door which Rosa herself had opened.He carried the black tulip wrapped up in a cloak, and, throwing himself into a coach, which was waiting for him at Gorcum, he drove off, without, as may well be imagined, having informed his friend Gryphus of his sudden departure."
"现在，正如我们看到的，他上了马车，如果读者允许的话，我们还会跟着他一直到他的目的地。","And now, as we have seen him enter his coach, we shall with the consent of the reader, follow him to the end of his journey."
"他行进得很慢，因为走快了，黑郁金香可受不了劳顿之苦。","He proceeded but slowly, as the black tulip could not bear travelling post-haste."
"可是博克斯戴尔担心自己到晚了，就在代夫特弄了个盒子，把盒子四周铺上青苔，把郁金香装在里面。这样一来，花儿就不怕四周有什么挤压，上面还有空气透下来，马车现在可以全速行进了，也不用担心郁金香会有什么损伤。","But Boxtel, fearing that he might not arrive early enough, procured at Delft a box, lined all round with fresh moss, in which he packed the tulip.The flower was so lightly pressed upon all sides, with a supply of air from above, that the coach could now travel full speed without any possibility of injury to the tulip."
"他第二天早上到了哈勒姆，虽然疲惫却很得意。为了毁掉偷窃的痕迹，他把郁金香移栽到另一个花盆，把原来的花盆敲碎，将碎片扔进了运河。然后，他给园艺协会主席写了封信，信中对主席宣称他刚到哈勒姆，还带了一株全黑的郁金香。他带着完好无恙的花儿，现已入住城里一家不错的旅馆，他就在那里等着。","He arrived next morning at Haarlem, fatigued but triumphant; and, to do away with every trace of the theft, he transplanted the tulip, and, breaking the original flower-pot, threw the pieces into the canal.After which he wrote the President of the Horticultural Society a letter, in which he announced to him that he had just arrived at Haarlem with a perfectly black tulip; and, with his flower all safe, took up his quarters at a good hotel in the town, and there he waited."
"第二十五章 范西斯当主席","Chapter 25 The President van Systens"
"罗莎离开科尔内留斯的时候，已经拿定主意，她要把被偷的郁金香交还给科尔内留斯，否则再不见他。","Rosa, on leaving Cornelius, had fixed on her plan, which was no other than to restore to Cornelius the stolen tulip, or never to see him again."
"她目睹了犯人的绝望，她知道他绝望有两个原因，而且是无法挽回的。","She had seen the despair of the prisoner, and she knew that it was derived from a double source, and that it was incurable."
"一方面，分离是不可避免的，格里弗斯一下子意外发现了他们相爱和私会的秘密。","On the one hand, separation became inevitable,—Gryphus having at the same time surprised the secret of their love and of their secret meetings."
"另一方面，科尔内留斯·范巴尔莱过去七年来，一直将他的抱负寄托在黑郁金香上，现在所有的希望都破灭了。","On the other hand, all the hopes on the fulfilment of which Cornelius van Baerle had rested his ambition for the last seven years were now crushed."
"罗莎是这样一种女人，有点小事就会沮丧，可是在危难关头，她却能从不幸中找到与之斗争的力量，或者找到补救的办法。","Rosa was one of those women who are dejected by trifles, but who in great emergencies are supplied by the misfortune itself with the energy for combating or with the resources for remedying it."
"罗莎来到她的房间，最后扫视了一眼四周，看看是不是她自己弄错了，或许郁金香被搁在某个角落里，她没看见罢了。可是她找也是白找，还是不见郁金香的踪影，它真的被偷了。","She went to her room, and cast a last glance about her to see whether she had not been mistaken, and whether the tulip was not stowed away in some corner where it had escaped her notice.But she sought in vain, the tulip was still missing; the tulip was indeed stolen."
"罗莎收拾了一小包路上的必需用品，带上她攒下的三百基尔德，也就是她全部的家当，把她藏在蕾丝里的第三个球茎取出来，小心翼翼地藏到自己怀里，然后把门反锁上，想以此尽可能久地掩护她逃走，她从一个小时前博克斯戴尔走的同一扇门离开了监狱，来到一家马行雇马车。","Rosa made up a little parcel of things indispensable for a journey; took her three hundred guilders,—that is to say, all her fortune,—fetched the third bulb from among her lace, where she had laid it up, and carefully hid it in her bosom; after which she locked her door twice to disguise her flight as long as possible, and, leaving the prison by the same door which an hour before had let out Boxtel, she went to a stable-keeper to hire a carriage."
"马行老板只有一辆两轮轻便马车，而这车昨天晚上就被博克斯戴尔租去了，现在他正驾着这辆马车在驶向代夫特的路上。由于这个国家有很多运河、河流和小溪，纵横交错，所以从洛维斯坦因到哈勒姆的路线格外迂回。","The man had only a two-wheel chaise, and this was the vehicle which Boxtel had hired since last evening, and in which he was now driving along the road to Delft; for the road from Loewestein to Haarlem, owing to the many canals, rivers, and rivulets intersecting the country, is exceedingly circuitous."
"没租到马车，罗莎只好租匹马了，马行老板一听罗莎是监狱看守的女儿，欣然将马交给了她。","Not being able to procure a vehicle, Rosa was obliged to take a horse, with which the stable-keeper readily intrusted her, knowing her to be the daughter of the jailer of the fortress."
"罗莎希望能够赶上给她送信的那个善良正直的小伙子，她会带上他，既可以让他带路，也可以有个照应。","Rosa hoped to overtake her messenger, a kind-hearted and honest lad, whom she would take with her, and who might at the same time serve her as a guide and a protector."
"事实上，她走了还不到一里格，就看到他沿着马路一边的人行道匆匆赶路，那条马路在河边，风景秀丽。她骑着马一路小跑过去，很快就追上了他。","And in fact she had not proceeded more than a league before she saw him hastening along one of the side paths of a very pretty road by the river.Setting her horse off at a canter, she soon came up with him."
"这个正直的小伙子并未意识到他所送信件的重要性，可他就像知道似的，还是走得挺快。不到一小时，他就已经走了一个半里格了。","The honest lad was not aware of the important character of his message; nevertheless, he used as much speed as if he had known it; and in less than an hour he had already gone a league and a half."
"罗莎从他那里拿过信，这信已没什么用处了，然后跟他说明她需要他的帮忙。船夫完全听从罗莎的安排，答应只要罗莎让他扶着马屁股或是抓着马缰，他一定能跟马并驾齐驱。这两个赶路人已经走了五个钟头，赶了八里格多路，而此时格里弗斯还蒙在鼓里，不知道自己的闺女已经离开了监狱。","Rosa took from him the note, which had now become useless, and explained to him what she wanted him to do for her.The boatman placed himself entirely at her disposal, promising to keep pace with the horse if Rosa would allow him to take hold of either the croup or the bridle of her horse.The two travellers had been on their way for five hours, and made more than eight leagues, and yet Gryphus had not the least suspicion of his daughter having left the fortress."
"这个监狱看守，生性恶毒残忍，一想到吓唬了自己女儿一顿，还在暗自发笑。","The jailer, who was of a very spiteful and cruel disposition, chuckled within himself at the idea of having struck such terror into his daughter’s heart."
"可当他暗自庆幸有这么一段好故事可以讲给他的好友听时，雅各布这家伙已经在去代夫特的路上了。由于马车跑得快多了，所以他领先罗莎和她的同伴儿足足四里格的路程。","But whilst he was congratulating himself on having such a nice story to tell to his boon companion, Jacob, that worthy was on his road to Delft; and, thanks to the swiftness of the horse, had already the start of Rosa and her companion by four leagues."
"当这位慈父想到自己的女儿还在房里哭泣，正为此高兴的时候，罗莎正尽力赶往哈勒姆。","And whilst the affectionate father was rejoicing at the thought of his daughter weeping in her room, Rosa was making the best of her way towards Haarlem."
"因此，只有犯人呆在格里弗斯认为他应该在的地方。","Thus the prisoner alone was where Gryphus thought him to be."
"罗莎自从开始照看郁金香以来，与她父亲相处的时间很少，所以直到吃饭时间，也就是中午十二点的时候，饥肠辘辘的格里弗斯才想起，他的女儿已经伤心很长时间了。","Rosa was so little with her father since she took care of the tulip, that at his dinner hour, that is to say, at twelve o’clock, he was reminded for the first time by his appetite that his daughter was fretting rather too long."
"他派手下去叫她，结果那人回来跟他说他叫了，可不见人出来，他这才决定亲自去叫她。","He sent one of the under-turnkeys to call her; and, when the man came back to tell him that he had called and sought her in vain, he resolved to go and call her himself."
"他先来到她的房间，可任凭门敲得再响，也不见罗莎回应。","He first went to her room, but, loud as he knocked, Rosa answered not."
"他派人请来监狱里的锁匠。门开了，可格里弗斯没有看见罗莎，就像罗莎找不到郁金香一样。","The locksmith of the fortress was sent for; he opened the door, but Gryphus no more found Rosa than she had found the tulip."
"就在那时，罗莎进入了鹿特丹。","At that very moment she entered Rotterdam."
"所以，格里弗斯在屋里、厨房、花园里都不可能见到罗莎的踪影。","Gryphus therefore had just as little chance of finding her in the kitchen as in her room, and just as little in the garden as in the kitchen."
"他向街坊一打听，才知道自己的女儿租了一匹马，像一个女冒险家似的，也没说去哪里就动身出发了，读者可以想象监狱看守此时有多么生气了。","The reader may imagine the anger of the jailer when, after having made inquiries about the neighbourhood, he heard that his daughter had hired a horse, and, like an adventuress, set out on a journey without saying where she was going."
"格里弗斯又怒气冲冲地上楼找到范巴尔莱，辱骂他，威胁他，把他牢房里仅有的那点可怜的家具也砸了，并扬言要他饱尝一切折磨，甚至饥饿和鞭笞。","Gryphus again went up in his fury to Van Baerle, abused him, threatened him, knocked all the miserable furniture of his cell about, and promised him all sorts of misery, even starvation and flogging."
"科尔内留斯压根儿就没听见监狱看守说的这些话，任由自己被虐待、辱骂和威胁，始终一副闷闷不乐、无动于衷的样子，仿佛对所有的情感和恐惧都麻木了。","Cornelius, without even hearing what his jailer said, allowed himself to be ill-treated, abused, and threatened, remaining all the while sullen, immovable, dead to every emotion and fear."
"格里弗斯找了一圈儿罗莎，又开始找雅各布，因为雅各布也不见了，那时，他才起疑心，是不是雅各布与罗莎私奔了。","After having sought for Rosa in every direction, Gryphus looked out for Jacob, and, as he could not find him either, he began to suspect from that moment that Jacob had run away with her."
"其间，姑娘在鹿特丹休息两小时后，又动身赶路了。那个晚上她在代夫特过夜，第二天早上她赶到哈勒姆，比博克斯戴尔晚到四小时。","The damsel, meanwhile, after having stopped for two hours at Rotterdam, had started again on her journey.On that evening she slept at Delft, and on the following morning she reached Haarlem, four hours after Boxtel had arrived there."
"罗莎到那里做的第一件事，就是让人领着去见哈勒姆园艺协会主席范西斯当先生。","Rosa, first of all, caused herself to be led before Mynheer van Systens, the President of the Horticultural Society of Haarlem."
"她是在这样的情境下见到这位可敬的先生的，为了避免我们的故事有失偏颇，我们不该省掉对这一情境的描述。","She found that worthy gentleman in a situation which, to do justice to our story, we must not pass over in our description."
"主席正在起草给协会委员会的报告。","The President was drawing up a report to the committee of the society."
"报告是主席用极工整的字体写在一张大纸上的。","This report was written on large-sized paper, in the finest handwriting of the President."
"罗莎被通报的时候，就只说是罗莎·格里弗斯。可这名字就算再好听，对主席来说都是陌生的，所以她被拒绝入内。","Rosa was announced simply as Rosa Gryphus; but as her name, well as it might sound, was unknown to the President, she was refused admittance."
"但罗莎并没有感到一丝窘迫，她已暗暗发誓，要完成自己的使命，就不能被拒绝、辱骂，甚至是残酷的暴力所打倒。","Rosa, however, was by no means abashed, having vowed in her heart, in pursuing her cause, not to allow herself to be put down either by refusal, or abuse, or even brutality."
"“请您跟主席通报一下，”她对仆人说，“我想跟他谈谈黑郁金香。”","“Announce to the President,” she said to the servant, “that I want to speak to him about the black tulip.”"
"这几个字就像咒语“芝麻开门”一样，成了畅通无阻的法宝，因为她很快就来到了主席办公室，范西斯当殷勤地起身迎接她。","These words seemed to be an “Open Sesame,” for she soon found herself in the office of the President, Van Systens, who gallantly rose from his chair to meet her."
"他身材瘦小，活像花茎，脑袋是花萼，两只无力的胳膊耷拉着就像郁金香的两片叶字。他摇摇摆摆走路的时候，就更像了，简直就是一朵微风中摇曳的郁金香。","He was a spare little man, resembling the stem of a flower, his head forming its chalice, and his two limp arms representing the double leaf of the tulip; the resemblance was rendered complete by his waddling gait which made him even more like that flower when it bends under a breeze."
"“嗯，小姐，”他说，“你来了，我听说，你知道黑郁金香的情况。”","“Well, miss,” he said, “you are coming, I am told, about the affair of the black tulip.”"
"对园艺协会主席来说，Tulipa nigra（黑郁金香）是最高权威，就像郁金香中的女王，当然可以派出使臣。","To the President of the Horticultural Society the Tulipa nigra was a first-rate power, which, in its character as queen of the tulips, might send ambassadors."
"“是的，先生，”罗莎回答，“我来这里，至少要跟您谈谈它。”","“Yes, sir,” answered Rosa; “I come at least to speak of it.”"
"“那它好吗？”范西斯当笑着问，和蔼又不失敬意。","“Is it doing well, then?” asked Van Systens, with a smile of tender veneration."
"“哎呀！先生，我不知道。”罗莎说。","“Alas! sir, I don’t know,” said Rosa."
"“怎么了？莫非它出什么事了吗？”","“How is that? could any misfortune have happened to it?”"
"“很大的麻烦，先生。不过暂时不是它遇到麻烦，而是我。”","“A very great one, sir; yet not to it, but to me.”"
"“什么麻烦？”","“What?”"
"“有人把它从我这儿偷走了。”","“It has been stolen from me.”"
"“偷走了！你是说黑郁金香？”","“Stolen! the black tulip?”"
"“是的，先生。”","“Yes, sir.”"
"“你知道是谁偷的吗？”","“Do you know the thief?”"
"“我有我的猜测，不过现在我还不能指控任何人。”","“I have my suspicions, but I must not yet accuse any one.”"
"“可是事情或许会很容易查明。”","“But the matter may very easily be ascertained.”"
"“为什么？”","“How is that?”"
"“既然黑郁金香是从你这儿偷走的，贼应该跑不了多远。”","“As it has been stolen from you, the thief cannot be far off.”"
"“为什么呢？”","“Why not?”"
"“因为我两小时前还见到了黑郁金香。”","“Because I have seen the black tulip only two hours ago.”"
"“您见过黑郁金香？”罗莎冲到范西斯当先生跟前，惊呼。","“You have seen the black tulip!” cried Rosa, rushing up to Mynheer van Systens."
"“就像我看见你一样，小姐。”","“As I see you, miss.”"
"“那它现在在哪儿？”","“But where?”"
"“嗯，当然是跟你的主人一块儿了。”","“Well, with your master, of course.”"
"“我的主人？”","“With my master?”"
"“是啊，你不是伊萨克·博克斯戴尔先生的仆人吗？”","“Yes, are you not in the service of Master Isaac Boxtel?”"
"“我？”“是你啊。”","“I?”“Yes, you.”"
"“可您认为我是谁呢，先生？”","“But for whom do you take me, sir?”"
"“那你又认为我是谁呢？”","“And for whom do you take me?”"
"“先生，我希望我没有弄错您的身份，您是尊敬的范西斯当先生，哈勒姆市市长，园艺协会的主席。”","“I hope, sir, I take you for what you are,—that is to say, for the honorable Mynheer van Systens, Burgomaster of Haarlem, and President of the Horticultural Society.”"
"“那你刚才告诉我什么？”","“And what is it you told me just now?”"
"“我告诉您，先生，我的郁金香被人偷了。”","“I told you, sir, that my tulip has been stolen.”"
"“那你的郁金香就是博克斯戴尔先生的郁金香咯。哎呀，孩子，你表述得不是很清楚啊。郁金香是被偷了，不过不是从你这儿，而是从博克斯戴尔先生那儿。”","“Then your tulip is that of Mynheer Boxtel.Well, my child, you express yourself very badly.The tulip has been stolen, not from you, but from Mynheer Boxtel.”"
"“我再跟您重复一遍，先生，我不知道谁是博克斯戴尔先生，我也是第一次听说这个名字。”","“I repeat to you, sir, that I do not know who this Mynheer Boxtel is, and that I have now heard his name pronounced for the first time.”"
"“你不认识博克斯戴尔先生？你也有黑郁金香？”","“You do not know who Mynheer Boxtel is, and you also had a black tulip?”"
"“难道除了我，还有人有黑郁金香吗？”罗莎声音颤抖地问。","“But is there any other besides mine?” asked Rosa, trembling."
"“是啊，博克斯戴尔先生就有。”","“Yes,—that of Mynheer Boxtel.”"
"“他的是什么样的？”","“How is it?”"
"“当然是黑色的了。”","“Black, of course.”"
"“没有斑点？”","“Without speck?”"
"“一个斑点都没有，一丝一毫都没有。”","“Without a single speck, or even point.”"
"“那郁金香在您这儿？您现在保管着它？”","“And you have this tulip,—you have it deposited here?”"
"“没有，不过会的，因为在颁奖前，黑郁金香要展示给委员会看看。”","“No, but it will be, as it has to be exhibited before the committee previous to the prize being awarded.”"
"“哦，先生！”罗莎叫道，“这个博克斯戴尔，这个伊萨克·博克斯戴尔，声称自己是黑郁金香主人——”","“Oh, sir!” cried Rosa, “this Boxtel—this Isaac Boxtel—who calls himself the owner of the black tulip—”"
"“那谁是黑郁金香的主人？”","“And who is its owner?”"
"“这人是不是很瘦？”","“Is he not a very thin man?”"
"“还秃顶？”","“Bald?”"
"“是的。”","“Yes.”"
"“眼睛深陷？”","“With sunken eyes?”"
"“我想是的。”","“I think he has.”"
"“神色慌张，佝着背，罗圈腿？”","“Restless, stooping, and bowlegged?”"
"“没错，你简直是在一笔一笔地画博克斯戴尔先生的肖像啊。”","“In truth, you draw Master Boxtel’s portrait feature by feature.”"
"“那郁金香呢，先生？那朵郁金香是不是在一个蓝白相间的陶盆里，陶盆三侧各有一篮黄色的花儿？”","“And the tulip, sir?Is it not in a pot of white and blue earthenware, with yellowish flowers in a basket on three sides?”"
"“啊！这个我就不确定了，我光关注花儿了，没怎么看花盆。”","“Oh, as to that I am not quite sure; I looked more at the flower than at the pot.”"
"“啊，先生！那是我的郁金香，是他从我这儿偷走的。我来这儿就是要当着您的面，要求收回我的郁金香。”","“Oh, sir! that’s my tulip, which has been stolen from me.I came here to reclaim it before you and from you.”"
"“哦！哦！”范西斯当审视着罗莎说，“什么！你到这儿来就是要收回博克斯戴尔先生的郁金香？好吧，我得说，真有你的。”","“Oh! oh!” said Van Systens, looking at Rosa.“What! you are here to claim the tulip of Master Boxtel?Well, I must say, you are cool enough.”"
"“尊敬的阁下，”罗莎听到他如此说话，有些生气，“我没有说我要收回博克斯戴尔先生的郁金香，我只是说我要收回我自己的郁金香。”","“Honoured sir,” a little put out by this apostrophe, “I do not say that I am coming to claim the tulip of Master Boxtel, but to reclaim my own.”"
"“你的？”","“Yours?”"
"“是的，我自己亲手培植呵护的郁金香。”","“Yes, the one which I have myself planted and nursed.”"
"“那好吧，你去白天鹅旅馆找博克斯戴尔先生，你自己跟他交涉此事。我呢，鉴于此案跟所罗门国王审判的案子一样复杂，很难给出判断，而我又不想假装自己和他一般睿智，所以我就满足于写写报告，确定黑郁金香的存在，叫人把十万基尔德奖给它的培植者就行了。再见吧，我的孩子。”","“Well, then, go and find out Master Boxtel, at the White Swan Inn, and you can then settle matters with him; as for me, considering that the cause seems to me as difficult to judge as that which was brought before King Solomon, and that I do not pretend to be as wise as he was, I shall content myself with making my report, establishing the existence of the black tulip, and ordering the hundred thousand guilders to be paid to its grower.Good-bye, my child.”"
"“啊，先生！先生！”罗莎恳求道。","“Oh, sir, sir!” said Rosa, imploringly."
"“只是，我的孩子，”范西斯当接着说，“看你年轻貌美，或许并不是什么坏人，给你一句忠告吧。你在这件事上千万得小心，因为我们哈勒姆这儿有法庭和监狱，而且，事关郁金香的荣誉，我们总是格外小心。去吧，我的孩子，去吧。记住，伊萨克·博克斯戴尔先生在白天鹅旅馆。”","“Only, my child,” continued Van Systens, “as you are young and pretty, and as there may be still some good in you, I’ll give you some good advice.Be prudent in this matter, for we have a court of justice and a prison here at Haarlem, and, moreover, we are exceedingly ticklish as far as the honour of our tulips is concerned.Go, my child, go, remember, Master Isaac Boxtel at the White Swan Inn.”"
"范西斯当先生拿起他那精致的钢笔，继续写因为罗莎的到访而被打断的那份报告。","And Mynheer van Systens, taking up his fine pen, resumed his report, which had been interrupted by Rosa’s visit."
"第二十六章 园艺协会的一个会员","Chapter 26 A Member of the Horticultural Society"
"罗莎想到可以再次找到黑郁金香，既高兴又害怕，不知如何是好，甚至几近疯狂，她朝白天鹅旅馆走去，身后跟着那名船夫，那个勇敢的弗里斯兰小伙子，身体结实得可以单枪匹马打倒一打博克斯戴尔。","Rosa, beyond herself and nearly mad with joy and fear at the idea of the black tulip being found again, started for the White Swan, followed by the boatman, a stout lad from Frisia, who was strong enough to knock down a dozen Boxtels single-handed."
"途中，他已经了解事态的发展，不畏惧遭遇任何强敌，只是他得到命令，一旦出现这种情况，不能伤到郁金香。","He had been made acquainted in the course of the journey with the state of affairs, and was not afraid of any encounter; only he had orders, in such a case, to spare the tulip."
"但一到大市场，罗莎立刻止住脚步，一个念头突然闪现，恰似荷马笔下的阿喀琉斯在怒火中烧的那一刻，头发被米涅瓦一把揪住。","But on arriving in the great market-place Rosa at once stopped, a sudden thought had struck her, just as Homer’s Minerva seizes Achilles by the hair at the moment when he is about to be carried away by his anger."
"“天啊！”她低声自语道，“我犯了个大错误，这可能毁了科尔内留斯、郁金香和我自己。我已经让他们警觉了，或许他们已经起了疑心。我不过是个女流之辈，这些男人要是联合起来对付我，我就死定了。我死了不要紧——只是科尔内留斯和郁金香怎么办！”","“Good Heaven!” she muttered to herself, “I have made a grievous blunder; it may be I have ruined Cornelius, the tulip, and myself.I have given the alarm, and perhaps awakened suspicion.I am but a woman; these men may league themselves against me, and then I shall be lost.If I am lost that matters nothing,—but Cornelius and the tulip!”"
"她思索了片刻。","She reflected for a moment."
"“如果我去找那个博克斯戴尔，结果不认识他；如果那个博克斯戴尔不是雅各布，而是另一位爱好者，并且也发现了黑郁金香；或许我的郁金香被另一个人偷了，或是落入他人之手；如果我不认识那人，那么，仅凭郁金香，如何证明花是我的呢？另一方面，就算我认出那个博克斯戴尔就是雅各布，谁知道又会发生什么呢？我们互相抢夺的时候，可能会把郁金香弄死了。”","“If I go to that Boxtel, and do not know him; if that Boxtel is not my Jacob, but another fancier, who has also discovered the black tulip; or if my tulip has been stolen by some one else, or has already passed into the hands of a third person;—if I do not recognize the man, only the tulip, how shall I prove that it belongs to me?On the other hand, if I recognise this Boxtel as Jacob, who knows what will come out of it? whilst we are contesting with each other, the tulip will die.”"
"就在此时，市场的另一端传来巨大的喧闹声，犹如远处大海上的惊涛骇浪。人们四散奔逃，门一扇扇打开又关上，唯有罗莎对这纷繁嘈杂充耳不闻。","In the meanwhile, a great noise was heard, like the distant roar of the sea, at the other extremity of the market-place.People were running about, doors opening and shutting, Rosa alone was unconscious of all this hubbub among the multitude."
"“我们必须回去找主席。”她喃喃地说。","“We must return to the President,” she muttered."
"“那好吧，咱们往回走。”船夫说道。","“Well, then, let us return,” said the boatman."
"他们沿着小街，径直来到范西斯当先生的住处，他优雅的手里握着上好的钢笔正在继续起草他的报告。","They took a small street, which led them straight to the mansion of Mynheer van Systens, who with his best pen in his finest hand continued to draw up his report."
"罗莎沿途听到人们都在谈论黑郁金香和那十万基尔德的奖金。消息像野火燎原般传遍了全城。","Everywhere on her way Rosa heard people speaking only of the black tulip, and the prize of a hundred thousand guilders.The news had spread like wildfire through the town."
"罗莎费了很大劲儿才再次来到范西斯当的办公室，而他再次为黑郁金香这个充满魔力的名字所触动。","Rosa had not a little difficulty is penetrating a second time into the office of Mynheer van Systens, who, however, was again moved by the magic name of the black tulip."
"但当他认出罗莎时，他勃然大怒，想要撵走她，因为他打心眼儿里认为罗莎是个疯子，或许比疯子更糟。","But when he recognised Rosa, whom in his own mind he had set down as mad, or even worse, he grew angry, and wanted to send her away."
"但罗莎双手紧扣，语调虔诚，足以打动任何男人的心：","Rosa, however, clasped her hands, and said with that tone of honest truth which generally finds its way to the hearts of men,—"
"“先生，看在上帝的份上，不要赶我走，听我把要说的话说完，就算您不能给我主持公道，但至少有一天您在上帝面前不会因为您曾促成一桩恶行而自责。”","“For Heaven’s sake, sir, do not turn me away; listen to what I have to tell you, and if it be not possible for you to do me justice, at least you will not one day have to reproach yourself before God for having made yourself the accomplice of a bad action.”"
"范西斯当不耐烦地直跺脚，这是罗莎第二次打断他的写作，无论是作为市长还是园艺协会的主席，写这份报告都会激发他的虚荣心。","Van Systens stamped his foot with impatience; it was the second time that Rosa interrupted him in the midst of a composition which stimulated his vanity, both as a burgomaster and as President of the Horticultural Society."
"“可我的报告！”他吼道，“关于黑郁金香的报告！”","“But my report!” he cried,—“my report on the black tulip!”"
"“范西斯当先生，”罗莎带着无辜和坦诚的坚定，继续说道，“如果您不听我说，您关于黑郁金香的报告就是基于犯罪和弄虚作假的报告。我恳请您，先生，把那个博克斯戴尔先生请到你我面前，我敢断定他就是雅各布，我发誓，如果我不能辨认出那花及其主人，那郁金香就是他的，我不会再来打扰他。”","“Mynheer van Systens,” Rosa continued, with the firmness of innocence and truth, “your report on the black tulip will, if you don’t hear me, be based on crime or on falsehood.I implore you, sir, let this Master Boxtel, whom I assert to be Master Jacob, be brought here before you and me, and I swear that I will leave him in undisturbed possession of the tulip if I do not recognise the flower and its holder.”"
"“好吧，我宣布，我有个提议。”范西斯当说。","“Well, I declare, here is a proposal,” said Van Systens."
"“您什么意思？”","“What do you mean?”"
"“我问你，你认出郁金香和他的主人，又能证明什么？”","“I ask you what can be proved by your recognising them?”"
"“毕竟，”罗莎绝望地说，“您是个正直的人，先生，如果您发现您把奖项颁给了一个不劳而获、偷窃黑郁金香的人，您会作何感想呢？”","“After all,” said Rosa, in her despair, “you are an honest man, sir; how would you feel if one day you found out that you had given the prize to a man for something which he not only had not produced, but which he had even stolen?”"
"罗莎的话似乎很有说服力，范西斯当心里多少有些相信了，他本要更温和地回应她，可突然从街上传来巨大的吵闹声，欢呼声大得连房子都在震动。","Rosa’s speech seemed to have brought a certain conviction into the heart of Van Systens, and he was going to answer her in a gentler tone, when at once a great noise was heard in the street, and loud cheers shook the house."
"“怎么啦？”市长叫道，“出什么事了？这可能吗？我没听错吧？”","“What is this?” cried the burgomaster; “what is this?Is it possible? have I heard aright?”"
"他冲到前厅，也顾不上罗莎了，把她一个人丢在房间。","And he rushed towards his anteroom, without any longer heeding Rosa, whom he left in his cabinet."
"他还没到前厅，就大声叫喊，他看见楼梯上挤满了人，一直涌到了楼梯顶，人群簇拥着，确切地说是追随在一个年轻人身后，他穿着紫色天鹅绒绣着银花的衣服，带着一种贵族气质，沿着白色石阶缓缓而上。","Scarcely had he reached his anteroom when he cried out aloud on seeing his staircase invaded, up to the very landing-place, by the multitude, which was accompanying, or rather following, a young man, simply clad in a violet-coloured velvet, embroidered with silver; who, with a certain aristocratic slowness, ascended the white stone steps of the house."
"身后跟着两名军官，一名海军，另一名是骑兵。","In his wake followed two officers, one of the navy, and the other of the cavalry."
"范西斯当推开惊慌失措的仆人，朝这位引起这阵骚动的来访者鞠躬，几乎是拜倒在他面前。","Van Systens, having found his way through the frightened domestics, began to bow, almost to prostrate himself before his visitor, who had been the cause of all this stir."
"“殿下，”他叫道，“殿下！殿下驾临寒舍，顿时让寒舍蓬荜生辉啊！”","“Monseigneur,” he called out, “Monseigneur!What distinguished honour is your Highness bestowing for ever on my humble house by your visit!”"
"“亲爱的范西斯当，”奥兰治亲王威廉说，面色安祥，这表情于他而言就是微笑，“我是一个地地道道的荷兰人，我喜欢水、啤酒和鲜花，有时候甚至喜欢法国人引以为荣的奶酪，就鲜花而言，我当然最钟爱郁金香。我在莱顿获悉哈勒姆最终培植出了黑郁金香，简直难以置信，不过确信此事的真实性后，我就来向园艺协会主席了解事情的来龙去脉。”","“Dear Mynheer van Systens,” said William of Orange, with a serenity which, with him, took the place of a smile, “I am a true Hollander, I am fond of the water, of beer, and of flowers, sometimes even of that cheese the flavour of which seems so grateful to the French; the flower which I prefer to all others is, of course, the tulip.I heard at Leyden that the city of Haarlem at last possessed the black tulip; and, after having satisfied myself of the truth of news which seemed so incredible, I have come to know all about it from the President of the Horticultural Society.”"
"“哦，殿下，殿下！”范西斯当说，“我们的努力能让殿下您高兴，这是协会莫大的荣幸啊！”","“Oh, Monseigneur, Monseigneur!” said Van Systens, “what glory to the society if its endeavours are pleasing to your Highness!”"
"“花在你这儿吗？”亲王问道，他似乎已经开始后悔方才那番长篇大论。","“Have you got the flower here?” said the Prince, who, very likely, already regretted having made such a long speech."
"“很遗憾，花不在这里。”","“I am sorry to say we have not.”"
"“那在哪儿？”","“And where is it?”"
"“在它主人那里。”","“With its owner.”"
"“那人是谁？”","“Who is he?”"
"“多特的一位老实的郁金香培植者。”","“An honest tulip-grower of Dort.”"
"“他叫什么？”","“His name?”"
"“博克斯戴尔。”","“Boxtel.”"
"“他住哪儿？”","“His quarters?”"
"“在白天鹅旅馆。我这就派人去叫他，这期间，如果殿下赏光移步客厅，若他知悉殿下您在这儿，定会赶紧带着他的郁金香前来拜见的。”","“At the White Swan; I shall send for him, and if in the meanwhile your Highness will do me the honour of stepping into my drawing-room, he will be sure—knowing that your Highness is here—to lose no time in bringing his tulip.”"
"“很好，派人叫他来。”","“Very well, send for him.”"
"“是，殿下，但是——”","“Yes, your Highness, but—”"
"“怎么啦？”","“What is it?”"
"“哦，也不是什么大事，殿下。”","“Oh, nothing of any consequence, Monseigneur.”"
"“天下无小事，范西斯当先生。”","“Everything is of consequence, Mynheer van Systens.”"
"“好吧，殿下，如果非说不可的话，这事还真有点麻烦。”","“Well, then, Monseigneur, if it must be said, a little difficulty has presented itself.”"
"“什么麻烦？”","“What difficulty?”"
"“有人冒认郁金香。这花可值十万基尔德。”","“This tulip has already been claimed by usurpers.It’s true that it is worth a hundred thousand guilders.”"
"“有这样的事？”","“Indeed?”"
"“是的，殿下，有人想夺走并冒充它的主人。”","“Yes, Monseigneur, by usurpers, by forgers.”"
"“这是犯罪，范西斯当先生。”","“This is a crime, Mynheer van Systens.”"
"“没错，殿下。”","“So it is, your Highness.”"
"“你有他们犯罪的证据吗？”","“And have you any proofs of their guilt?”"
"“没有，殿下，那名女罪犯——”","“No, Monseigneur, the guilty woman—”"
"“什么？女罪犯，阁下？”","“The guilty woman, Sir?”"
"“我是说那个冒认郁金香的女人，殿下，她就在隔壁房间。”","“I ought to say, the woman who claims the tulip, Monseigneur, is here in the room close by.”"
"“那你觉得她是什么人？”","“And what do you think of her?”"
"“我认为，殿下，她抵制不住十万基尔德的诱惑。”","“I think, Monseigneur, that the bait of a hundred thousand guilders may have tempted her.”"
"“所以她才冒认郁金香？”","“And so she claims the tulip?”"
"“是的，殿下。”","“Yes Monseigneur.”"
"“那她提供了什么证据？”","“And what proof does she offer?”"
"“我正要审问她，殿下您就来了。”","“I was just going to question her when your Highness came in.”"
"“审问她，范西斯当先生，现在就审问她。我是国家第一执政官，我将听审此案，主持公道。”","“Question her, Mynheer van Systens, question her.I am the first magistrate of the country; I will hear the case and administer justice.”"
"“您就是我的所罗门国王。”范西斯当鞠了一躬，为亲王引路。","“I have found my King Solomon,” said Van Systens, bowing, and showing the way to the Prince."
"殿下刚要趋步上前，他突然停住脚步说：","His Highness was just going to walk ahead, but, suddenly recollecting himself he said—"
"“你走我前面，直呼我先生就行。”","“Go before me, and call me plain Mynheer.”"
"于是两人进了房间。","The two then entered the cabinet."
"罗莎还站在原地，倚着窗口，隔着玻璃看外面的花园。","Rosa was still standing at the same place, leaning on the window, and looking through the panes into the garden."
"“啊！原来是个弗里斯兰姑娘。”亲王说道，他注意到罗莎镶金织锦的头饰和红色衬裙。","“Ah! a Frisian girl,” said the Prince, as he observed Rosa’s gold brocade headdress and red petticoat."
"听到脚步声，她转过身来，但她几乎没看见坐在房间最暗的角落里的亲王。","At the noise of their footsteps she turned round, but scarcely saw the Prince, who seated himself in the darkest corner of the apartment."
"不难想象，她全部的注意力都在那位叫范西斯当的要员身上，根本无暇顾及主人身后那位谦卑的陌生人，对他她一无所知，或许他声名显赫，或许他默默无闻。","All her attention, as may be easily imagined, was fixed on that important person who was called Van Systens, so that she had no time to notice the humble stranger who was following the master of the house, and who, for aught she knew, might be somebody or nobody."
"这个谦卑的陌生人从书架上取下一本书，示意范西斯当立即开始质询。","The humble stranger took a book down from the shelf, and made Van Systens a sign to commence the examination forthwith."
"应身着紫色外套的年轻人的邀请，范西斯当也坐下了，被人器重让他深感幸福和荣耀，他开始质询：","Van Systens, likewise at the invitation of the young man in the violet coat, sat down in his turn, and, quite happy and proud of the importance thus cast upon him, began,—"
"“我的孩子，你能保证关于这株花的陈述都是真实的，一点儿都不掺假吗？”","“My child, you promise to tell me the truth and the entire truth concerning this tulip?”"
"“我保证。”","“I promise.”"
"“好，那么，当着这位先生的面说吧，他是园艺协会的会员。”","“Well, then, speak before this gentleman; this gentleman is one of the members of the Horticultural Society.”"
"“除了我跟您说过的，”罗莎说道，“我还能说什么呢，先生？”","“What am I to tell you, sir,” said Rosa, “beside that which I have told you already.”"
"“噢，那你说过什么？”","“Well, then, what is it?”"
"“我之前已向您提出的要求。”","“I repeat the question I have addressed to you before.”"
"“什么要求？”","“Which?”"
"“就是您应该叫博克斯戴尔先生带着郁金香到这儿来当面对质。如果我认出那不是我的花，我会直言相告。可我如果认出那是我的花，我就收回我的花，即使去见总督殿下，我手里也有证据。”","“That you will order Mynheer Boxtel to come here with his tulip.If I do not recognise it as mine I will frankly tell it; but if I do recognise it I will reclaim it, even if I go before his Highness the Stadtholder himself, with my proofs in my hands.”"
"“这么说，你有证据，我的孩子？”","“You have, then, some proofs, my child?”"
"“上帝知道我的权利，他会帮我获得证据的。”","“God, who knows my good right, will assist me to some.”"
"范西斯当和亲王交换了一下眼神，从罗莎一开始说话，亲王就在努力回想是不是见过她，好似那甜美的嗓音不是第一次在他耳畔响起。","Van Systens exchanged a look with the Prince, who, since the first words of Rosa, seemed to try to remember her, as if it were not for the first time that this sweet voice rang in his ears."
"一名军官被派去找博克斯戴尔，同时，范西斯当的审问还在继续。","An officer went off to fetch Boxtel, and Van Systens in the meanwhile continued his examination."
"“你有什么理由一口咬定你是黑郁金香的真正主人？”","“And with what do you support your assertion that you are the real owner of the black tulip?”"
"“再简单不过的事实啊，我在自己的屋里培植的黑郁金香啊！”","“With the very simple fact of my having planted and grown it in my own chamber.”"
"“在你的屋里？你的屋子在哪儿？”","“In your chamber? Where was your chamber?”"
"“在洛维斯坦因。”","“At Loewestein.”"
"“你从洛维斯坦因来？”","“You are from Loewestein?”"
"“我是监狱看守的女儿。”","“I am the daughter of the jailer of the fortress.”"
"亲王一欠身，似乎在说：“是的，没错，我想起来了。”","The Prince made a little movement, as much as to say, “Well, that’s it, I remember now.”"
"他一边假装看书，一边更专注地看着罗莎。","And, all the while feigning to be engaged with his book, he watched Rosa with even more attention than he had before."
"“你喜欢花吗？”范西斯当先生继续问。","“And you are fond of flowers?” continued Mynheer van Systens."
"“是的，先生。”","“Yes, sir.”"
"“那么，我想你对种花很在行吧？”","“Then you are an experienced florist, I dare say?”"
"罗莎迟疑了一会儿，然后用最真诚的语调说：","Rosa hesitated a moment; then with a tone which came from the depth of her heart, she said,—"
"“先生们，我是在和高尚的人说话。”","“Gentlemen, I am speaking to men of honor.”"
"她的言语如此真诚，乃至范西斯当和亲王同时予以首肯。","There was such an expression of truth in the tone of her voice, that Van Systens and the Prince answered simultaneously by an affirmative movement of their heads."
"“好吧，我对种花并不在行，我只是个可怜的女孩，三个月前我还是那些不能识文断字的普通人中的一个。是的，郁金香不是我自己培植的。”","“Well, then, I am not an experienced florist; I am only a poor girl, one of the people, who, three months ago, knew neither how to read nor how to write.No, the black tulip has not been found by myself.”"
"“那还有谁？”","“But by whom else?”"
"“洛维斯坦因一名可怜的囚犯。”","“By a poor prisoner of Loewestein.”"
"“洛维斯坦因的囚犯？”亲王跟着说道。","“By a prisoner of Loewestein?” repeated the Prince."
"他的音调让罗莎大吃一惊，她确信此前听过这声音。","The tone of his voice startled Rosa, who was sure she had heard it before."
"“是名政治犯吧，”亲王继续说道，“因为那里只关政治犯。”","“By a prisoner of state, then,” continued the Prince, “as there are none else there.”"
"说完，他又开始看书，至少是装着在看书。","Having said this he began to read again, at least in appearance."
"“是的，”罗莎吞吞吐吐地说，“是的，是一个政治犯。”","“Yes,” said Rosa, with a faltering voice, “yes, by a prisoner of state.”"
"范西斯当听到在如此重要的人面前供认这样的事实，不禁不寒而栗。　","Van Systens trembled as he heard such a confession made in the presence of such a witness."
"“继续！”亲王冷冷地对协会主席说。","“Continue,” said William dryly, to the President of the Horticultural Society."
"“啊，先生，”罗莎对她心目中的真正法官说，“我将严肃地控告我自己犯下的罪行。”","“Ah, sir,” said Rosa, addressing the person whom she thought to be her real judge, “I am going to incriminate myself very seriously.”"
"“那是应该，”范西斯当说，“在洛维斯坦因，政治犯应该严密看守的。”","“Certainly,” said Van Systens, “the prisoner of state ought to be kept in close confinement at Loewestein.”"
"“哎呀！先生。”","“Alas! sir.”"
"“你刚才告诉我，你利用监狱看守女儿的身份与一名政治犯交流如何种花。”","“And from what you tell me you took advantage of your position, as daughter of the jailer, to communicate with a prisoner of state about the cultivation of flowers.”"
"“的确如此，先生，”罗莎惊恐地低语，“是的，我得承认，我每天都和他见面。”","“So it is, sir,” Rosa murmured in dismay; “yes, I am bound to confess, I saw him every day.”"
"“不幸的姑娘！”范西斯当感慨道。","“Unfortunate girl!” exclaimed Van Systens."
"亲王注意到罗莎受了惊吓，主席也面色苍白，他抬起头，以果断清晰的口吻说：","The Prince, observing the fright of Rosa and the pallor of the President, raised his head, and said, in his clear and decided tone,—"
"“这对园艺协会成员毫无意义，他们只对黑郁金香作出裁决，并不审理政治犯罪。继续，年轻的姑娘，往下说。”","“This cannot signify anything to the members of the Horticultural Society; they have to judge on the black tulip, and have no cognizance to take of political offences.Go on, young woman, go on.”"
"范西斯当意味深长地望了亲王一眼，借此以郁金香的名义向这位园艺协会的新会员表示感谢。","Van Systens, by means of an eloquent glance, offered, in the name of the tulip, his thanks to the new member of the Horticultural Society."
"罗莎受到陌生人的鼓舞，心中不再恐惧，把三个月来发生的一切，她的所作所为以及她承受的一切痛苦一股脑儿地倾诉出来。她讲述了格里弗斯如何残忍；第一个球茎如何被毁；囚犯何等悲伤，如何加倍小心确保第二个球茎的成功；囚犯如何耐心以及分别后他何等焦虑；因为没有郁金香的消息，他要如何绝食；重逢时他是何等喜悦；最后，她谈到当发现刚开一小时的黑郁金香被盗时，他们是何等绝望。","Rosa, reassured by this sort of encouragement which the stranger was giving her, related all that had happened for the last three months, all that she had done, and all that she had suffered.She described the cruelty of Gryphus; the destruction of the first bulb; the grief of the prisoner; the precautions taken to insure the success of the second bulb; the patience of the prisoner and his anxiety during their separation; how he was about to starve himself because he had no longer any news of his tulip; his joy when she went to see him again; and, lastly, their despair when they found that the tulip which had come into flower was stolen just one hour after it had opened."
"她情真意切地将细节娓娓道来，虽然没有让亲王动容，却成功地打动了范西斯当。","All this was detailed with an accent of truth which, although producing no change in the impassible mien of the Prince, did not fail to take effect on Van Systens."
"“可是，”亲王说，“你结识囚犯的时间并不长啊。”","“But,” said the Prince, “it cannot be long since you knew the prisoner.”"
"罗莎睁大双眼看着陌生人，他躲在黑暗的角落里，似乎要避开她的注视。","Rosa opened her large eyes and looked at the stranger, who drew back into the dark corner, as if he wished to escape her observation."
"“为什么呢，先生？”她问他。","“Why, sir?” she asked him."
"“因为监狱看守格里弗斯和他女儿搬至洛维斯坦因，到现在还不足四个月。”","“Because it is not yet four months since the jailer Gryphus and his daughter were removed to Loewestein.”"
"“是这样的，先生。”","“That is true, sir.”"
"“要不然，一定是你唆使你父亲调动，以追随那名可能从海牙转至洛维斯坦因的囚犯。”","“Otherwise, you must have solicited the transfer of your father, in order to be able to follow some prisoner who may have been transported from the Hague to Loewestein.”"
"“先生。”罗莎红着脸说。","“Sir,” said Rosa, blushing."
"“把你要说的话说完。”威廉说。","“Finish what you have to say,” said William."
"“我承认我在海牙就认识这名囚犯。”","“I confess I knew the prisoner at the Hague.”"
"“多么幸福的囚犯啊！”威廉微笑着说。","“Happy prisoner!” said William, smiling."
"就在此时，派去找博克斯戴尔的军官回来了，他向亲王禀报他要找的人带着郁金香随后就到。","At this moment the officer who had been sent for Boxtel returned, and announced to the Prince that the person whom he had been to fetch was following on his heels with his tulip."
"第二十七章 第三个球茎","Chapter 27 The Third Bulb"
"话音未落，博克斯戴尔就走进范西斯当先生的客厅，身后跟着两个人，抬着一个箱子，将置于其中的贵重之物取出，放在桌上。","Boxtel’s return was scarcely announced, when he entered in person the drawing-room of Mynheer van Systens, followed by two men, who carried in a box their precious burden and deposited it on a table."
"得到通报的亲王离开书房，来到客厅，欣赏了一番黑郁金香，然后又悄悄回到黑暗的角落，重新坐在他之前搬来的椅子上。","The Prince, on being informed, left the cabinet, passed into the drawing-room, admired the flower, and silently resumed his seat in the dark corner, where he had himself placed his chair."
"罗莎浑身颤抖，面色惨白，惶恐不安地等着别人叫她去看郁金香。","Rosa, trembling, pale and terrified, expected to be invited in her turn to see the tulip."
"她现在听到了博克斯戴尔的声音。","She now heard the voice of Boxtel."
"“就是他！”她叫道。","“It is he!” she exclaimed."
"亲王示意她过去，从开着的门朝客厅张望。","The Prince made her a sign to go and look through the open door into the drawing-room."
"“这是我的郁金香。”罗莎嚷道，“我认得它，啊！我可怜的科尔内留斯。”","“It is my tulip,” cried Rosa, “I recognise it.Oh, my poor Cornelius!”"
"说到此，她泪如泉涌。","And saying this she burst into tears."
"亲王起身离座，走到门前，站立片刻，完全置身于光线下。","The Prince rose from his seat, went to the door, where he stood for some time with the full light falling upon his figure."
"罗莎的目光落在他的身上，更加坚信她不是第一次遇见这个陌生人。","As Rosa’s eyes now rested upon him, she felt more than ever convinced that this was not the first time she had seen the stranger."
"“博克斯戴尔先生，”亲王说，“请到里面来。”","“Master Boxtel,” said the Prince, “come in here, if you please.”"
"博克斯戴尔迫不及待地走上前，发现自己和奥兰治亲王威廉面对面了，他后退了一步。","Boxtel eagerly approached, and, finding himself face to face with William of Orange, started back."
"“殿下！”他高呼。","“His Highness!” he called out."
"“殿下！”罗莎惊愕地重复道。","“His Highness!” Rosa repeated in dismay."
"听到左边有人惊呼，博克斯戴尔转过身，发现了罗莎。","Hearing this exclamation on his left, Boxtel turned round, and perceived Rosa."
"这一瞥让这个窃贼像遭受电击一般浑身颤栗。","At this sight the whole frame of the thief shook as if under the influence of a galvanic shock."
"“啊！”亲王喃喃自语道，“他不知所措了。”","“Ah!” muttered the Prince to himself, “he is confused.”"
"可是博克斯戴尔竭力控制自己的情绪，恢复了常态。","But Boxtel, making a violent effort to control his feelings, was already himself again."
"“博克斯戴尔先生，”威廉说，“看来你已经找到了种植黑郁金香的秘密？”","“Master Boxtel,” said William, “you seem to have discovered the secret of growing the black tulip?”"
"“是的，殿下，”博克斯戴尔回答，声音里多少还有些惴惴不安。","“Yes, your Highness,” answered Boxtel, in a voice which still betrayed some confusion."
"当然，他的惴惴不安或许可以解释为突然邂逅亲王的激动表现。","It is true his agitation might have been attributable to the emotion which the man must have felt on suddenly recognising the Prince."
"“但是，”总督继续说道，“这儿有位年轻姑娘，也声称自己种出了黑郁金香。”","“But,” continued the Stadtholder, “here is a young damsel who also pretends to have found it.”"
"博克斯戴尔耸耸肩，露出轻蔑的笑容。","Boxtel, with a disdainful smile, shrugged his shoulders."
"威廉饶有兴趣地注视着他的一举一动。","William watched all his movements with evident interest and curiosity."
"“这么说，你不认识这个年轻女孩啦？”亲王问。","“Then you don’t know this young girl?” said the Prince."
"“是的，不认识，殿下！”","“No, your Highness!”"
"“你呢，孩子，你认识博克斯戴尔先生吗？”","“And you, child, do you know Master Boxtel?”"
"“我不认识博克斯戴尔先生，但我认识雅各布先生。”","“No, I don’t know Master Boxtel, but I know Master Jacob.”"
"“这怎么解释？”","“What do you mean?”"
"“我是说，这位自称是伊萨克·博克斯戴尔的人在洛维斯坦因用的名字可是雅各布。”","“I mean to say that at Loewestein the man who here calls himself Isaac Boxtel went by the name of Master Jacob.”"
"“对此你作何解释，博克斯戴尔先生？”","“What do you say to that, Master Boxtel?”"
"“这个姑娘在撒谎，殿下。”","“I say that this damsel lies, your Highness.”"
"“那么，你否认你在洛维斯坦因呆过吗？”","“You deny, therefore, having ever been at Loewestein?”"
"博克斯戴尔犹豫了一下，王子咄咄逼人的目光使他不敢撒谎。","Boxtel hesitated; the fixed and searching glance of the proud eye of the Prince prevented him from lying."
"“不可否认，我是在洛维斯坦因呆过，殿下，但我没有偷黑郁金香。”","“I cannot deny having been at Loewestein, your Highness, but I deny having stolen the tulip.”"
"“你偷了，从我屋里偷的。”罗莎厉声回应，义愤填膺。","“You have stolen it, and that from my room,” cried Rosa, with indignation."
"“我不承认。”","“I deny it.”"
"“好吧，听我说。难道你能否认，我整理花坛，打算把它种下去的那天，你跟着我到了花园吗？难道你能否认，在我假装种它时，你跟着我进了花园吗？难道你能否认，那天晚上，我刚一离开，你就奔过去，希望在那儿找到球茎吗？难道你能否认，你用双手在地里挖——但是，感谢上帝！你白忙活了，因为那只是戳穿你阴谋的计策。说，你敢否认这一切吗？”","“Now listen to me.Do you deny having followed me into the garden, on the day when I prepared the border where I was to plant it?Do you deny having followed me into the garden when I pretended to plant it?Do you deny that, on that evening, you rushed after my departure to the spot where you hoped to find the bulb?Do you deny having dug in the ground with your hands—but, thank God! in vain, as it was a stratagem to discover your intentions.Say, do you deny all this?”"
"博克斯戴尔觉得不宜对上述控诉给出答复，于是转向亲王，说道：","Boxtel did not deem it fit to answer these several charges, but, turning to the Prince, continued,—"
"“我在多特种了二十年的郁金香。我在这一业界也小有名望。我的一个杂交品种还上了品种名录，用的是一个人尽皆知的名字。我把它献给了葡萄牙国王。殿下，我现在就将这事的真实情况讲与您听。这位姑娘获悉我培植出了黑郁金香，于是与洛维斯坦因监狱的情人合谋诋毁我，以便她本人可以堂而皇之地领取十万基尔德的大奖，而这笔奖金，相信有殿下主持公道，应该属于我。”","“I have now for twenty years grown tulips at Dort.I have even acquired some reputation in this art; one of my hybrids is entered in the catalogue under the name of an illustrious personage.I have dedicated it to the King of Portugal.The truth in the matter is as I shall now tell your Highness.This damsel knew that I had produced the black tulip, and, in concert with a lover of hers in the fortress of Loewestein, she formed the plan of ruining me by appropriating to herself the prize of a hundred thousand guilders, which, with the help of your Highness’s justice, I hope to gain.”"
"“呸！”罗莎怒不可遏地骂道。","“Yah!” cried Rosa, beyond herself with anger."
"“肃静！”亲王说。","“Silence!” said the Prince."
"随后，他转身问博克斯戴尔：","Then, turning to Boxtel, he said,—"
"“你所指的这位姑娘的情人，那名犯人，他叫什么名字？”","“And who is that prisoner to whom you allude as the lover of this young woman?”"
"罗莎几乎要晕倒了，因为科尔内留斯被指定为危险囚犯，由亲王交与监狱看守加以特别监视。","Rosa nearly swooned, for Cornelius was designated as a dangerous prisoner, and recommended by the Prince to the especial surveillance of the jailer."
"再也没有比这更让博克斯戴尔合意的问题了。","Nothing could have been more agreeable to Boxtel than this question."
"“这名囚犯，”他说，“只要您听到他的名字，殿下您就会对他人品的信任大打折扣。他是政治犯，一度被判死刑。”","“This prisoner,” he said, “is a man whose name in itself will prove to your Highness what trust you may place in his probity.He is a prisoner of state, who was once condemned to death.”"
"“他叫什么？”","“And his name?”"
"罗莎绝望地用双手掩住脸。","Rosa hid her face in her hands with a movement of despair."
"“他叫科尔内留斯·范巴尔莱，”博克斯戴尔说，“他是恶棍科尔内留斯·德维特的教子。”","“His name is Cornelius van Baerle,” said Boxtel, “and he is godson of that villain Cornelius de Witt.”"
"亲王为之一怔，平素祥和的眼睛闪烁不定，一贯波澜不惊的脸上呈现出死一般的惨白。","The Prince gave a start, his generally quiet eye flashed, and a death-like paleness spread over his impassible features."
"他走到罗莎跟前，用手指示意她将双手从脸上挪开。","He went up to Rosa, and with his finger, gave her a sign to remove her hands from her face."
"犹如受到某种催眠术的力量，罗莎根本没有看见手势，却照着做了。","Rosa obeyed, as if under mesmeric influence, without having seen the sign."
"“这么说，就是为了这个人，你到莱顿恳求我调任你的父亲？”","“It was, then to follow this man that you came to me at Leyden to solicit for the transfer of your father?”"
"罗莎垂下头，几近窒息，答道：","Rosa hung down her head, and, nearly choking, said,—"
"“是的，殿下。”","“Yes, your Highness.”"
"“继续。”亲王对博克斯戴尔说。","“Go on,” said the Prince to Boxtel."
"“我说完了。”伊萨克接着说。“殿下您知悉了一切。可有件事我本不打算提，因为我不想让这姑娘为她的忘恩负义感到羞愧。我因工作的关系来到洛维斯坦因。就这样，我结识了老格里弗斯，并爱上了他的女儿，我向她求婚，因为我并不富有，便很冒失地提到自己有望获得十万基尔德一事，为了证明这并非黄粱美梦，我给他们看了黑郁金香。她的情人原在多特以种植郁金香掩盖其政治阴谋，现在他们合伙儿要毁了我。就在花开那天的前一刻，这位年轻的姑娘将花偷走了。她把花带到她的房间，厚颜无耻地打发信使告知园艺协会，说她培植出了大黑郁金香，而就在这当口，我有幸将它弄了回来。但她并未就此住手。毋庸置疑，在她把花放置其室内的若干小时里，她把花展示给好几个所谓的证人看。不过，万幸的是，殿下您已经被提醒要提防这个骗子和她的证人了。”","“I have nothing more to say,” Isaac continued.“Your Highness knows all.But there is one thing which I did not intend to say, because I did not wish to make this girl blush for her ingratitude.I came to Loewestein because I had business there.On this occasion I made the acquaintance of old Gryphus, and, falling in love with his daughter, made an offer of marriage to her; and, not being rich, I committed the imprudence of mentioning to them my prospect of gaining a hundred thousand guilders, in proof of which I showed to them the black tulip.Her lover having himself made a show at Dort of cultivating tulips to hide his political intrigues, they now plotted together for my ruin.On the eve of the day when the flower was expected to open, the tulip was taken away by this young woman.She carried it to her room, from which I had the good luck to recover it at the very moment when she had the impudence to despatch a messenger to announce to the members of the Horticultural Society that she had produced the grand black tulip.But she did not stop there.There is no doubt that, during the few hours which she kept the flower in her room, she showed it to some persons whom she may now call as witnesses.But, fortunately, your Highness has now been warned against this impostor and her witnesses.”"
"“哦，天啊，我的天啊！多么无耻的谎言！”罗莎说着，泪如雨下，跪倒在总督脚下，总督尽管认为她有罪，但见她如此伤心，不禁动了恻隐之心。","“Oh, my God, my God! what infamous falsehoods!” said Rosa, bursting into tears, and throwing herself at the feet of the Stadtholder, who, although thinking her guilty, felt pity for her dreadful agony."
"“你铸成大错了，我的孩子，”他说，“你的情人也将因为教唆你受到惩罚。你如此年轻，样子又老实，我宁可相信犯错的是他而不是你。”","“You have done very wrong, my child,” he said, “and your lover shall be punished for having thus badly advised you.For you are so young, and have such an honest look, that I am inclined to believe the mischief to have been his doing, and not yours.”"
"“殿下！殿下！”罗莎哭喊道，“科尔内留斯没有罪。”","“Monseigneur! Monseigneur!” cried Rosa, “Cornelius is not guilty.”"
"威廉愣了一下。","William started."
"“他没有犯教唆你的罪？你想说的是这个意思，对吗？”","“Not guilty of having advised you? that’s what you want to say, is it not?”"
"“我想说的是，殿下，前后两项罪名都是强加给他的，科尔内留斯没有罪。”","“What I wish to say, your Highness, is that Cornelius is as little guilty of the second crime imputed to him as he was of the first.”"
"“前一项罪也是强加给他的？你知道他犯的是什么罪吗？你知道他受何指控，被判何刑吗？他是科尔内留斯·德维特的同谋，藏匿了议长和德卢瓦侯爵的信件。”","“Of the first?And do you know what was his first crime?Do you know of what he was accused and convicted?Of having, as an accomplice of Cornelius de Witt, concealed the correspondence of the Grand Pensionary and the Marquis de Louvois.”"
"“噢，先生，他不知道托他保管的信件的内容，对此他一无所知。我对此深信不疑，就像相信自己的生命一样，要不然，他一定会告诉我的。他的心灵如此纯洁，怎么可能独自承受这个秘密而不跟我讲呢？不，不，殿下，就算冒犯您，让您不高兴，我还是要说，科尔内留斯没有罪，他是清白的，对这两项罪名，他都是无辜的。啊！殿下，您要是了解我的科尔内留斯就好了！”","“Well, sir, he was ignorant of this correspondence being deposited with him; completely ignorant.I am as certain as of my life, that, if it were not so, he would have told me; for how could that pure mind have harboured a secret without revealing it to me?No, no, your Highness, I repeat it, and even at the risk of incurring your displeasure, Cornelius is no more guilty of the first crime than of the second; and of the second no more than of the first.Oh, would to Heaven that you knew my Cornelius; Monseigneur!”"
"“他跟德维特是一伙的！”博克斯戴尔叫道，“殿下对他实在是再了解不过了，还曾饶过他的命。”","“He is a De Witt!” cried Boxtel.“His Highness knows only too much of him, having once granted him his life.”"
"“肃静！”亲王说，“我前面已经说过，所有国家事务均不在哈勒姆园艺协会的管辖范围内。”","“Silence!” said the Prince; “all these affairs of state, as I have already said, are completely out of the province of the Horticultural Society of Haarlem.”"
"接着，他皱了皱眉，补充道：","Then, knitting his brow, he added,—"
"“至于郁金香，放松点，博克斯戴尔先生，你会得到公正的。”","“As to the tulip, make yourself easy, Master Boxtel, you shall have justice done to you.”"
"博克斯戴尔满心欢喜地鞠躬，接受主席的祝贺。","Boxtel bowed with a heart full of joy, and received the congratulations of the President."
"“你，我的孩子，”奥兰治亲王威廉继续说，“你差点儿犯罪。我不会惩罚你，但是真正的元凶将两罪并罚。叫这个名字的男人可能在实施阴谋，甚至是背叛国家，但他不应该是窃贼。”","“You, my child,” William of Orange continued, “you were going to commit a crime.I will not punish you; but the real evil-doer shall pay the penalty for both.A man of his name may be a conspirator, and even a traitor, but he ought not to be a thief.”"
"“窃贼！”罗莎叫道，“您说科尔内留斯是窃贼？”求求您，殿下，不要用这个字眼，他要是知道您这么说，会痛不欲生的。如果说盗窃，我向您发誓，阁下，只有这个小人才会做出这种勾当。”","“A thief!” cried Rosa. “Cornelius a thief?Pray, your Highness, do not say such a word, it would kill him, if he knew it.If theft there has been, I swear to you, Sir, no one else but this man has committed it.”"
"“那你就拿证据说话。”博克斯戴尔冷冷地说。","“Prove it,” Boxtel coolly remarked."
"“我会证明给你看的。上帝会帮我。”","“I shall prove it.With God’s help I shall.”"
"她转身问博克斯戴尔：","Then, turning towards Boxtel, she asked,—"
"“这是你的郁金香？”","“The tulip is yours?”"
"“没错。”","“It is.”"
"“一共有过几个球茎？”","“How many bulbs were there of it?”"
"博克斯戴尔迟疑片刻，稍作思考后，他得到结论，他已经知道之前有两个球茎，如果没有其他球茎，她不会这样问。于是他回答：","Boxtel hesitated for a moment, but after a short consideration he came to the conclusion that she would not ask this question if there were none besides the two bulbs of which he had known already.He therefore answered,—"
"“三个。”","“Three.”"
"“它们结果怎样？”","“What has become of these bulbs?”"
"“啊！它们结果怎样？呃，一个没发芽，第二个开出了黑郁金香。”","“Oh! what has become of them?Well, one has failed; the second has produced the black tulip.”"
"“那第三个呢？”","“And the third?”"
"“第三个！”","“The third!”"
"“第三个——它在哪儿？”","“The third,—where is it?”"
"“我放在家里了。”博克斯戴尔说，有些慌乱。","“I have it at home,” said Boxtel, quite confused."
"“在家里？哪里？洛维斯坦因，还是多特？”","“At home?Where?At Loewestein, or at Dort?”"
"“多特。”博克斯戴尔说。","“At Dort,” said Boxtel."
"“你撒谎！”罗莎大声说。“殿下，”她转身面对亲王，继续说，“我告诉您这三个球茎的真实情况吧。第一个球茎在犯人的牢房里被我父亲碾碎了，这人很清楚这事，他本人就想得到球茎，因为希望破灭，他差点儿和我父亲翻脸，他的失望因我父亲而起。我种下第二个球茎，而且开出了黑郁金香，第三个，也就是最后一个”——说到这里，她从胸口掏出球茎——“就是它，它和其他两个球茎都曾包在这张纸里。科尔内留斯·范巴尔莱上断头台前，把三个球茎都交给了我。拿着，殿下，拿着。”","“You lie!” cried Rosa.“Monseigneur,” she continued, whilst turning round to the Prince, “I will tell you the true story of these three bulbs.The first was crushed by my father in the prisoner’s cell, and this man is quite aware of it, for he himself wanted to get hold of it, and, being balked in his hope, he very nearly fell out with my father, who had been the cause of his disappointment.The second bulb, planted by me, has produced the black tulip, and the third and last”—saying this, she drew it from her bosom—“here it is, in the very same paper in which it was wrapped up together with the two others.When about to be led to the scaffold, Cornelius van Baerle gave me all the three.Take it, Monseigneur, take it.”"
"罗莎展开纸，把球茎递给亲王，亲王从她手中接过球茎，仔细审视。","And Rosa, unfolding the paper, offered the bulb to the Prince, who took it from her hands and examined it."
"“可是，殿下，这个球茎也许是这位年轻姑娘偷来的，就像她偷了郁金香一样。”博克斯戴尔支支吾吾地说，看到亲王审视球茎时的专注神情，后来又更留意起罗莎的举动，她在看留在她手中的那张纸上的几行字，博克斯戴尔显然有些担心。","“But, Monseigneur, this young woman may have stolen the bulb, as she did the tulip,” Boxtel said, with a faltering voice, and evidently alarmed at the attention with which the Prince examined the bulb; and even more at the movements of Rosa, who was reading some lines written on the paper which remained in her hands."
"她的眼睛忽然一亮。她呼吸急促，焦虑地将那张神秘的纸看了一遍又一遍，最后她惊叫一声，把纸递给亲王，说道：“您看看，殿下，看在老天的份上，看看上面写了什么！”","Her eyes suddenly lighted up; she read, with breathless anxiety, the mysterious paper over and over again; and at last, uttering a cry, held it out to the Prince and said, “Read, Monseigneur, for Heaven’s sake, read!”"
"威廉将第三个球茎递给范西斯当，接过纸读起来。","William handed the third bulb to Van Systens, took the paper, and read."
"他刚瞄上一眼，就一个踉跄，手指发颤，几乎失手把纸掉在地上。他脸上流露出痛苦和怜悯的表情，见了着实让人发怵。","No sooner had he looked at it than he began to stagger; his hand trembled, and very nearly let the paper fall to the ground; and the expression of pain and compassion in his features was really frightful to see."
"这就是那张从《圣经》上撕下的扉页，科尔内留斯·德维特让他弟弟约翰的仆人克莱克送到多特，让范巴尔莱将议长和德卢瓦侯爵的往来信件烧毁。","It was that fly-leaf, taken from the Bible, which Cornelius de Witt had sent to Dort by Craeke, the servant of his brother John, to request Van Baerle to burn the correspondence of the Grand Pensionary with the Marquis de Louvois."
"读者或许记得，这张纸上写道：","This request, as the reader may remember, was couched in the following terms:—"
"“我亲爱的教子：","“My Dear Godson,—"
"“你把我交付于你的包裹烧了。不要看它，也不要打开，直接烧掉，这样你就永远不知道里面的内容。这里面的秘密足以断送任何保管者的性命。烧掉它，你就能挽救约翰和科尔内留斯·德维特的性命。","“Burn the parcel which I have intrusted to you.Burn it without looking at it, and without opening it, so that its contents may for ever remain unknown to yourself.Secrets of this description are death to those with whom they are deposited.Burn it, and you will have saved John and Cornelius de Witt."
"“再见，爱我。","“Farewell, and love me."
"“科尔内留斯·德维特","“Cornelius de Witt."
"“一六七二年八月二十日。”","“August 20, 1672.”"
"这张纸为范巴尔莱的清白和他对郁金香的所有权提供了证据。","This slip of paper offered the proofs both of Van Baerle’s innocence and of his claim to the property of the tulip."
"罗莎和总督互相看了一眼。","Rosa and the Stadtholder exchanged one look only."
"罗莎的意思是：“瞧，您看明白了吧。”","That of Rosa was meant to express, “Here, you see yourself.”"
"总督表示：“静观其变。”","That of the Stadtholder signified, “Be quiet, and wait.”"
"亲王拭去额头上的冷汗，慢慢将纸折起，而思绪却像在迷宫中游离，没有目标，没有方向，有的只是对往昔的懊恼和羞愧。","The Prince wiped the cold sweat from his forehead, and slowly folded up the paper, whilst his thoughts were wandering in that labyrinth without a goal and without a guide, which is called remorse and shame for the past."
"但他旋即努力抬起头，以惯常的语调说：","Soon, however, raising his head with an effort, he said, in his usual voice,—"
"“走吧，博克斯戴尔先生，你会得到公正，我向你保证。”","“Go, Mr. Boxtel; justice shall be done, I promise you.”"
"然后，他转向主席，补充道：","Then, turning to the President, he added,—"
"“你，我亲爱的范西斯当先生，照顾好这位年轻姑娘和郁金香。再见！”","“You, my dear Mynheer van Systens, take charge of this young woman and of the tulip.Good-bye.”"
"在所有人的恭送下，亲王离开，消失在外面震耳欲聋的欢呼声中。","All bowed, and the Prince left, among the deafening cheers of the crowd outside."
"博克斯戴尔回到旅店，很是困惑不安，威廉从罗莎手里接过的那张纸，殿下看完折好，小心谨慎地放进自己的口袋，对这一切的猜疑折磨着博克斯戴尔。这一切意味着什么呢？","Boxtel returned to his inn, rather puzzled and uneasy, tormented by misgivings about that paper which William had received from the hand of Rosa, and which his Highness had read, folded up, and so carefully put in his pocket.What was the meaning of all this?"
"罗莎走到郁金香前，轻吻叶子，带着满心的欢喜和对上帝的信任，她脱口而出：","Rosa went up to the tulip, tenderly kissed its leaves and, with a heart full of happiness and confidence in the ways of God, broke out in the words,—"
"“上帝，您最清楚，我亲爱的科尔内留斯教我认字，最终会派上用场的。”","“Thou knowest best for what end Thou madest my good Cornelius teach me to read.”"
"第二十八章 花颂","Chapter 28 The Hymn of the Flowers "
"当上章所述事件发生时，不幸的范巴尔莱被遗忘在洛维斯坦因监狱的牢房里，在格里弗斯的魔爪下，他作为犯人所受的摧残无以复加，而监狱看守下定决心要扮演刽子手的角色。","Whilst the events we have described in our last chapter were taking place, the unfortunate Van Baerle, forgotten in his cell in the fortress of Loewestein, suffered at the hands of Gryphus all that a prisoner can suffer when his jailer has formed the determination of playing the part of hangman."
"由于罗莎和雅各布都杳无音信，格里弗斯说服自己这一切都是魔鬼在作祟，而科尔内留斯医生就是撒旦派到人世间的。","Gryphus, not having received any tidings of Rosa or of Jacob, persuaded himself that all that had happened was the devil’s work, and that Dr. Cornelius van Baerle had been sent on earth by Satan."
"结果，在雅各布和罗莎失踪的第三天，一个阳光明媚的上午，他来到科尔内留斯的牢房，比平时还要愤怒。","The result of it was, that, one fine morning, the third after the disappearance of Jacob and Rosa, he went up to the cell of Cornelius in even a greater rage than usual."
"科尔内留斯胳膊肘倚在窗台上，撑着头，目光在遥远的天际游弋，看到多特的风车在转动，他呼吸着新鲜空气，强忍住眼眶里的泪水，用他自己的达观让自己变得坚强。","The latter, leaning with his elbows on the window-sill and supporting his head with his two hands, whilst his eyes wandered over the distant hazy horizon where the windmills of Dort were turning their sails, was breathing the fresh air, in order to be able to keep down his tears and to fortify himself in his philosophy."
"鸽子还在那里，可希望荡然无存，没有前途可以展望。","The pigeons were still there, but hope was not there; there was no future to look forward to."
"哎呀！罗莎因为被监视，无法前来。她会写信给他吗？即便她写了，她能把信送到他手里吗？","Alas! Rosa, being watched, was no longer able to come.Could she not write? and if so, could she convey her letters to him?"
"不，不可能。过去的两天，他从老格里弗斯眼中读出太多的怒火与邪恶，以至于根本不敢奢望他的警觉会有片刻的松懈。再说，她不是也得承受比禁闭和分别更大的痛苦吗？这个无情的、口出恶言的酒鬼，会不会像希腊戏剧中那些冷酷的父亲般报复自己的女儿？当他酒性发作，头脑发热的时候，那条由科尔内留斯接好的胳膊是否会力量倍增呢？","No, no.He had seen during the two preceding days too much fury and malignity in the eyes of old Gryphus to expect that his vigilance would relax, even for one moment.Moreover, had not she to suffer even worse torments than those of seclusion and separation?Did this brutal, blaspheming, drunken bully take revenge on his daughter, like the ruthless fathers of the Greek drama?And when the Genievre had heated his brain, would it not give to his arm, which had been only too well set by Cornelius, even double force?"
"想到罗莎可能受到虐待，科尔内留斯几乎要疯了。","The idea that Rosa might perhaps be ill-treated nearly drove Cornelius mad."
"他随之感受到自己的无能为力。他问自己，上帝让两个无辜的生灵承受如此折磨，这是否公平。当然，每当此时，他就开始质疑上帝的智慧。这种怀疑源于不幸对他的诅咒。","He then felt his own powerlessness.He asked himself whether God was just in inflicting so much tribulation on two innocent creatures.And certainly in these moments he began to doubt the wisdom of Providence.It is one of the curses of misfortune that it thus begets doubt."
"范巴尔莱想给罗莎写信，可罗莎在哪儿呢？","Van Baerle had proposed to write to Rosa, but where was she?"
"他还想赶在格里弗斯来之前，往海牙写信，但毋庸置疑，格里弗斯一定会诋毁他，尽其所能地给他新一轮的打击报复。","He also would have wished to write to the Hague to be beforehand with Gryphus, who, he had no doubt, would by denouncing him do his best to bring new storms on his head."
"但他拿什么写呢？格里弗斯夺走了他的纸和笔，就算他有纸和笔，他也不指望格里弗斯会替他把信送去。","But how should he write?Gryphus had taken the paper and pencil from him, and even if he had both, he could hardly expect Gryphus to despatch his letter."
"于是，科尔内留斯绞尽脑汁，不幸的犯人们能想到的办法他都想了。","Then Cornelius revolved in his mind all those stratagems resorted to by unfortunate prisoners."
"他想过越狱，以前每天能和罗莎见面时，他从未有过这种念头。可他考虑得越多，越清楚地意识到这种尝试太不现实。他是那种喜欢精挑细选而厌恶平庸的人，常常因为不走寻常路而错失大好机会，其实世俗之道可以让人无所不往。","He had thought of an attempt to escape, a thing which never entered his head whilst he could see Rosa every day; but the more he thought of it, the more clearly he saw the impracticability of such an attempt.He was one of those choice spirits who abhor everything that is common, and who often lose a good chance through not taking the way of the vulgar, that high road of mediocrity which leads to everything."
"科尔内留斯寻思着：“我怎么能像之前的格劳休斯那样逃离洛维斯坦因呢？自那以后，不是采取了一切防范措施吗？窗户不是被栅栏封死了吗？门都增设成两道甚至三道，岗哨不是也提高了十倍的警觉吗？除此之外，不是还有一个百眼巨人监视着我吗？那双充满仇恨的锐利双眼让格里弗斯更加危险。重要的是，罗莎不在身边，我失去了精神依托，这不是事实吗？假如我用十年的时间做成一把锉刀，将窗户栅栏锯断，或编出绳索爬出窗外，或在双肩粘上翅膀，像代达罗斯那样飞走，可以吗？可如今我时运不济。锉刀会变钝，绳索会断裂，翅膀会在阳光下熔化。我一定会死得很惨，等人们捡到我时，一定是缺胳膊少腿的。我会被贴上标签，搁置在海牙博物馆展览，陈列在沉默者威廉血迹斑斑的紧身上衣和斯塔伏伦捕捉的母海象间，我这番计划的唯一结果就是为自己在荷兰的奇闻奇物中谋求一席之地。","“How is it possible,” said Cornelius to himself, “that I should escape from Loewestein, as Grotius has done the same thing before me?Has not every precaution been taken since?Are not the windows barred?Are not the doors of double and even of treble strength, and the sentinels ten times more watchful?And have not I, besides all this, an Argus so much the more dangerous as he has the keen eyes of hatred?Finally, is there not one fact which takes away all my spirit, I mean Rosa’s absence?But suppose I should waste ten years of my life in making a file to file off my bars, or in braiding cords to let myself down from the window, or in sticking wings on my shoulders to fly, like Daedalus?But luck is against me now.The file would get dull, the rope would break, or my wings would melt in the sun; I should surely kill myself, I should be picked up maimed and crippled; I should be labelled, and put on exhibition in the museum at the Hague between the blood-stained doublet of William the Taciturn and the female walrus captured at Stavesen, and the only result of my enterprise will have been to procure me a place among the curiosities of Holland."
"“可是，不，那也强于现在的处境。终有一天，格里弗斯会对我施暴。失去了快乐和罗莎的陪伴，尤其是失去了我心爱的郁金香，我也没有了耐心。毋庸置疑，格里弗斯迟早会以残忍的方式攻击我的自尊、我的爱情甚至危及我的人身安全。不知何故，自被囚禁以来，我变得好斗，这种感觉怪异却不可抗拒。呃，我会卡住那个老恶棍的喉咙，把他掐死。”","“But no; and it is much better so.Some fine day Gryphus will commit some atrocity.I am losing my patience, since I have lost the joy and company of Rosa, and especially since I have lost my tulip.Undoubtedly, some day or other Gryphus will attack me in a manner painful to my self-respect, or to my love, or even threaten my personal safety.I don’t know how it is, but since my imprisonment I feel a strange and almost irresistible pugnacity.Well, I shall get at the throat of that old villain, and strangle him.”"
"想到此，科尔内留斯停了片刻，咬着嘴唇，凝视前方。接着，他迫不及待地回到之前的想法，那想法似乎有种奇怪的吸引力，让他乐在其中，他继续想象：","Cornelius at these words stopped for a moment, biting his lips and staring out before him; then, eagerly returning to an idea which seemed to possess a strange fascination for him, he continued,—"
"“啊，一旦我掐死了他，我就从他身上取下钥匙，就像做了最高尚的事情那样从楼梯下来，把罗莎带出她的房间，告诉她一切，然后带着她从窗口纵身跳入瓦尔河，为什么不这么做呢？我可是游泳的好手，足以让两人脱身。罗莎，——不，上帝啊，格里弗斯可是她的父亲！无论她多么爱我，她也不会赞成我掐死她父亲的，尽管他是如此野蛮和邪恶。","“Well, and once having strangled him, why should I not take his keys from him, why not go down the stairs as if I had done the most virtuous action, why not go and fetch Rosa from her room, why not tell her all, and jump from her window into the Waal?I am expert enough as a swimmer to save both of us.Rosa,—but, oh Heaven, Gryphus is her father!Whatever may be her affection for me, she will never approve of my having strangled her father, brutal and malicious as he has been."
"“我会因此与她发生争执，争执间，某个卑劣的看守发现奄奄一息的格里弗斯，或者他已经身亡，他会赶来将我逮住。这样一来，我将再次看到布伊坦霍夫，可怕的大刀寒光闪闪，可这次它不会中途停下，而是会与我的颈背亲密接触。","“I shall have to enter into an argument with her; and in the midst of my speech some wretched turnkey who has found Gryphus with the death-rattle in his throat, or perhaps actually dead, will come along and put his hand on my shoulder.Then I shall see the Buytenhof again, and the gleam of that infernal sword,—which will not stop half-way a second time, but will make acquaintance with the nape of my neck."
"“这不行，科尔内留斯，我的好伙计，——这真是一个糟糕的计划。但我又能怎样呢，我如何才能再找到罗莎呢？”","“It will not do, Cornelius, my fine fellow,—it is a bad plan.But, then, what is to become of me, and how shall I find Rosa again?”"
"当读者看到科尔内留斯驻足窗前时，正是他与罗莎分别的第三天，当时科尔内留斯前思后想的就是这些。","Such were the cogitations of Cornelius three days after the sad scene of separation from Rosa, at the moment when we find him standing at the window."
"就在那时，格里弗斯进来了。","And at that very moment Gryphus entered."
"他手持巨棍，眼露凶光，嘴角挂着奸笑，浑身上下，甚至一举一动都透着邪恶的企图。","He held in his hand a huge stick, his eyes glistening with spiteful thoughts, a malignant smile played round his lips, and the whole of his carriage, and even all his movements, betokened bad and malicious intentions."
"科尔内留斯听到他进来，也猜到是他，但没有转身，因为他深知罗莎不会在他身后。","Cornelius heard him enter, and guessed that it was he, but did not turn round, as he knew well that Rosa was not coming after him."
"对于正在气头的人来说，没有什么比对手的泰然处之更让他们恼羞成怒的了。","There is nothing more galling to angry people than the coolness of those on whom they wish to vent their spleen."
"既然付出了代价，就不希望打水漂，一旦怒火中烧，血液就开始沸腾，多少要吵上一番，否则功夫就白费了。","The expense being once incurred, one does not like to lose it; one’s passion is roused, and one’s blood boiling, so it would be labour lost not to have at least a nice little row."
"因此，格里弗斯见科尔内留斯无动于衷，就竭力弄出些声响吸引他的注意：","Gryphus, therefore, on seeing that Cornelius did not stir, tried to attract his attention by a loud—"
"“哼，哼！”","“Umph, umph!”"
"科尔内留斯唇齿间正轻轻哼着“花颂”——一首忧伤而动听的歌：","Cornelius was humming between his teeth the “Hymn of Flowers,”—a sad but very charming song,—"
"“我们是神秘之火的女儿，在大地血脉里流动的火之女；我们是曙光女神和露珠的女儿；我们是空气的女儿；我们是水的女儿；但首先，我们是上天的女儿。”","“We are the daughters of the secret fire Of the fire which runs through the veins of the earth; We are the daughters of Aurora and of the dew; We are the daughters of the air; We are the daughters of the water; But we are, above all, the daughters of heaven.”"
"歌曲温和优美的旋律传递出淡淡的忧伤，这愈发激怒了格里弗斯。","This song, the placid melancholy of which was still heightened by its calm and sweet melody, exasperated Gryphus."
"他用棒子敲击着牢房的石板地面，叫喊着：","He struck his stick on the stone pavement of the cell, and called out,—"
"“喂！唱鸟曲的先生，没听到我说话吗？”","“Halloa! my warbling gentleman, don’t you hear me?”"
"科尔内留斯转过身来，敷衍了一句“上午好”，然后又接着唱：","Cornelius turned round, merely saying, “Good morning,” and then began his song again:—"
"“人们爱我们，却又玷污、毁灭我们，我们与大地一线相连；这一线就是我们的根，是我们的生命，但我们高举臂膀，迎向上天。”","“Men defile us and kill us while loving us, We hang to the earth by a thread; This thread is our root, that is to say, our life, But we raise on high our arms towards heaven.”"
"“啊，你这个遭诅咒的巫师！你在嘲笑我，我看得出来。”格里弗斯咆哮着。","“Ah, you accursed sorcerer! you are making game of me, I believe,” roared Gryphus."
"科尔内留斯还在唱：","Cornelius continued:—"
"“因为天堂是我们的家，真正的家，我们的灵魂之所，灵魂从那儿来又回到那儿去，——我们的灵魂亦是花香。”","“For heaven is our home, Our true home, as from thence comes our soul, As thither our soul returns,—Our soul, that is to say, our perfume.”"
"格里弗斯走到犯人跟前，说：　","Gryphus went up to the prisoner and said,—"
"“可你不知道吧，我已经想到法子让你屈服，迫使你认罪啦。”","“But you don’t see that I have taken means to get you under, and to force you to confess your crimes.”"
"“我亲爱的格里弗斯先生，你生气了吗？”科尔内留斯问道。","“Are you mad, my dear Master Gryphus?” asked Cornelius."
"他这才注意到这个老监狱看守几近疯狂，目光如炬，嘴上唾沫横飞，他说：","And, as he now for the first time observed the frenzied features, the flashing eyes, and foaming mouth of the old jailer, he said,—"
"“上帝保佑这个人吧，他不仅生气了，简直是怒不可遏。”","“Bless the man, he is more than mad, he is furious.”"
"格里弗斯在他的头顶挥舞着棍棒，可范巴尔莱没有动，仍两手叉腰站在那里。","Gryphus flourished his stick above his head, but Van Baerle moved not, and remained standing with his arms akimbo."
"“看样子你想威胁我，格里弗斯先生。”","“It seems your intention to threaten me, Master Gryphus.”"
"“是的，没错，我就是要威胁你。”看守叫道。","“Yes, indeed, I threaten you,” cried the jailer."
"“那你想用什么威胁我？”","“And with what?”"
"“你先看看我手里拿的什么。”","“First of all, look at what I have in my hand.”"
"“我想是根棍子。”科尔内留斯镇定地说，“可我并不相信你用这个就能吓唬我。”","“I think that’s a stick,” said Cornelius calmly, “but I don’t suppose you will threaten me with that.”"
"“噢，你不相信！凭什么不信？”","“Oh, you don’t suppose! why not?”"
"“因为任何监狱看守殴打犯人都要受到两种处罚，——第一种处罚，按照洛维斯坦因狱规第九条规定：","“Because any jailer who strikes a prisoner is liable to two penalties,—the first laid down in Article 9 of the regulations at Loewestein:—"
"“‘任何看守，巡查员或狱卒，动手殴打政治犯，一律革职。’”","“‘Any jailer, inspector, or turnkey who lays hands upon any prisoner of State will be dismissed.’”"
"“是的，动手殴打，”格里弗斯气疯了，说，“可狱规里没有提到用棍子殴打。”","“Yes, who lays hands,” said Gryphus, mad with rage, “but there is not a word about a stick in the regulation.”"
"“第二种处罚，”科尔内留斯继续说，“狱规里没写，但可以在别处找到依据：","“And the second,” continued Cornelius, “which is not written in the regulation, but which is to be found elsewhere:—"
"“‘凡动棍的，必遭棍打。’”","“‘Whosoever takes up the stick will be thrashed by the stick.’”"
"在科尔内留斯沉着镇定、义正词严的说教下，格里弗斯越来越恼羞成怒，他挥舞着棍棒，可就在他扬起棍棒的那一刹那，科尔内留斯冲过去，一把夺过了棍棒，夹在自己的胳膊下。","Gryphus, growing more and more exasperated by the calm and sententious tone of Cornelius, brandished his cudgel, but at the moment when he raised it Cornelius rushed at him, snatched it from his hands, and put it under his own arm."
"格里弗斯气得嗷嗷直叫。","Gryphus fairly bellowed with rage."
"“嘘，嘘，我的好伙计，”科尔内留斯说，“别做傻事，把你的差事丢了。”","“Hush, hush, my good man,” said Cornelius, “don’t do anything to lose your place.”"
"“啊，你这个巫师！我会加倍惩罚你的。”格里弗斯吼道。","“Ah, you sorcerer! I’ll pinch you worse,” roared Gryphus."
"“我愿你心想事成。”","“I wish you may.”"
"“你没看见我手空了吗？”","“Don’t you see my hand is empty?”"
"“是，我瞧见了，而且我很高兴如此。”","“Yes, I see it, and I am glad of it.”"
"“你知道我早上上楼的时候，手里通常可不是空的。”","“You know that it is not generally so when I come upstairs in the morning.”"
"“没错，你通常给我拿来人们能想到的最糟糕的汤和最粗劣的饭菜。不过那对我来说不是惩罚，我只吃面包，而且那面包你觉得越难吃，对我来说就越好吃。”","“It’s true, you generally bring me the worst soup, and the most miserable rations one can imagine.But that’s not a punishment to me; I eat only bread, and the worse the bread is to your taste, the better it is to mine.”"
"“为什么会是这样？”","“How so?”"
"“噢，这是一个很简单的问题。”","“Oh, it’s a very simple thing.”"
"“那就说给我听听。”格里弗斯说。","“Well, tell it me,” said Gryphus."
"“非常乐意。我知道，你认为给我坏面包就是不让我好过。”","“Very willingly.I know that in giving me bad bread you think you do me harm.”"
"“那当然。我给你坏面包可不是为了取悦你，你这土匪。”","“Certainly; I don’t give it you to please you, you brigand.”"
"“好吧，你也知道我是个巫师，把你的坏面包变成好面包，比吃最好的蛋糕还享受。这样我就有了双重愉悦，一方面，吃这东西能满足我的味觉，另一方面这么做还能激怒你。”","“Well, then, I, who am a sorcerer, as you know, change your bad into excellent bread, which I relish more than the best cake; and then I have the double pleasure of eating something that gratifies my palate, and of doing something that puts you in a rage.”"
"格里弗斯发出低沉的怒吼。","Gryphus answered with a growl."
"“啊！那你承认你是一个巫师了。”","“Oh! you confess, then, that you are a sorcerer.”"
"“没错，我是巫师。我不会当着所有人这么说，因为他们可能会因此把我烧死，但现在就我们两个，我告诉你也无妨。”","“Indeed, I am one.I don’t say it before all the world, because they might burn me for it, but as we are alone, I don’t mind telling you.”"
"“好吧，好吧，好吧，”格里弗斯回答，“不过，一个巫师能把黑面包变成白面包，但要是压根没有面包，他不会饿死吗？”","“Well, well, well,” answered Gryphus.“But if a sorcerer can change black bread into white, won’t he die of hunger if he has no bread at all?”"
"“你什么意思？”科尔内留斯说。","“What’s that?” said Cornelius."
"“所以，我再不会给你拿来任何面包，八天后，咱们看看会怎么样。”","“Consequently, I shall not bring you any bread at all, and we shall see how it will be after eight days.”"
"科尔内留斯脸色变得苍白。","Cornelius grew pale."
"“那咱们就从今天算起吧。”格里弗斯接着说道，“你既然是如此聪明的巫师，哎呀，你最好把你房里的家具变成面包。而我呢，还能把发给你的十八个铜子的伙食费放进自己的腰包。”","“And,” continued Gryphus, “we’ll begin this very day.As you are such a clever sorcerer, why, you had better change the furniture of your room into bread; as to myself, I shall pocket the eighteen sous which are paid to me for your board.”"
"“可你那是谋杀！”科尔内留斯叫道，这种惨死的方式唤起他本能的恐惧，这一冲动一下子让他不知所措了。","“But that’s murder,” cried Cornelius, carried away by the first impulse of the very natural terror with which this horrible mode of death inspired him."
"“好啦，”格里弗斯继续嘲讽他，“既然你是个巫师，无论如何你都能活下来的。”","“Well,” Gryphus went on, in his jeering way, “as you are a sorcerer, you will live, notwithstanding.”"
"科尔内留斯的脸上又浮现了笑容，说：","Cornelius put on a smiling face again, and said,—"
"“你没看见过我把多特的鸽子召唤到这来吗？”","“Have you not seen me make the pigeons come here from Dort?”"
"“那又怎样？”格里弗斯说。","“Well?” said Gryphus."
"“嗯，鸽子可是美味佳肴啊，我想，一个人每天吃一只鸽子总不会饿死吧。”","“Well, a pigeon is a very dainty morsel, and a man who eats one every day would not starve, I think.”"
"“可你没火怎么吃？”格里弗斯说。","“And how about the fire?” said Gryphus."
"“火！可你知道，我跟魔鬼是一伙的。你认为魔鬼会让我没火用吗？要知道，火可是魔鬼特有的啊！”","“Fire! but you know that I’m in league with the devil.Do you think the devil will leave me without fire?Why, fire is his proper element.”"
"“一个人，就算他的胃口再好，也不能每天都吃鸽子呀。以前就有人为此下过赌注，结果不得不认输了。”","“A man, however healthy his appetite may be, would not eat a pigeon every day.Wagers have been laid to do so, and those who made them gave them up.”"
"“那等我吃腻了鸽子后，我从瓦尔河和马斯河弄点鱼上来不就得了。”","“Well, but when I am tired of pigeons, I shall make the fish of the Waal and of the Meuse come up to me.”"
"格里弗斯睁大了双眼，他有些糊涂了。","Gryphus opened his large eyes, quite bewildered."
"“我可喜欢吃鱼了，”科尔内留斯接着说，“你从来不让我吃鱼。好吧，我就好好利用你饿我的机会，痛痛快快地吃鱼。”","“I am rather fond of fish,” continued Cornelius; “you never let me have any.Well, I shall turn your starving me to advantage, and regale myself with fish.”"
"格里弗斯又气又怕，差点没晕过去，但他很快就恢复过来，手插在兜里说：","Gryphus nearly fainted with anger and with fright, but he soon rallied, and said, putting his hand in his pocket,—"
"“好吧，是你逼我这么做的。”说着，他从兜里掏出一把弹簧刀，把刀打开。","“Well, as you force me to it,” and with these words he drew forth a clasp-knife and opened it."
"“啊呀！刀都使出来了？”科尔内留斯说着，做好了用棍子防卫的准备。","“Halloa! a knife?” said Cornelius, preparing to defend himself with his stick."
"第二十九章 范巴尔莱离开洛维斯坦因前，与格里弗斯算账","Chapter 29 In Which Van Baerle, before Leaving Loewestein, Settles Accounts with Gryphus"
"两个人沉默不语，相持了好几分钟，格里弗斯处于攻势，范巴尔莱处于守势。","The two remained silent for some minutes, Gryphus on the offensive, and Van Baerle on the defensive."
"本来这种局面或许会无休止地持续下去，可科尔内留斯急于知道到底是什么缘故让他的看守如此愤怒，所以他先开了口，问道：","Then, as the situation might be prolonged to an indefinite length, Cornelius, anxious to know something more of the causes which had so fiercely exasperated his jailer, spoke first by putting the question,—"
"“你究竟想要什么？”","“Well, what do you want, after all?”"
"“我就告诉你我想要什么，”格里弗斯回答，“我要你把我的女儿罗莎还给我。”","“I’ll tell you what I want,” answered Gryphus; “I want you to restore to me my daughter Rosa.”"
"“你的女儿？”范巴尔莱叫道。","“Your daughter?” cried Van Baerle."
"“是的，我的女儿罗莎，你不是施了魔鬼的巫术，把她从我这里抢走了吗？那好，你说不说，她在哪儿？”","“Yes, my daughter Rosa, whom you have taken from me by your devilish magic.Now, will you tell me where she is?”"
"格里弗斯的态度越来越吓人。","And the attitude of Gryphus became more and more threatening."
"“罗莎不在洛维斯坦因？”科尔内留斯大声问。","“Rosa is not at Loewestein?” cried Cornelius."
"“你清楚得很，她不在。再问你一遍，你能不能把她还给我？”","“You know well she is not.Once more, will you restore her to me?”"
"“我明白了，”科尔内留斯说，“这是你给我设的陷阱。”","“I see,” said Cornelius, “this is a trap you are laying for me.”"
"“现在，最后一次问你，你说不说，我的女儿在哪儿？”","“Now, for the last time, will you tell me where my daughter is?”"
"“你这个无赖，如果你不知道，自己去猜好了。”","“Guess it, you rogue, if you don’t know it.”"
"“那你等着，你等着瞧！”格里弗斯气得脸色惨白、嘴唇发抖，他一边恶狠狠地说着，一边开始动歪脑筋。“啊！你什么都不说？那好，我就撬开你的牙！”","“Only wait, only wait,” growled Gryphus, white with rage, and with quivering lips, as his brain began to turn.“Ah, you will not tell me anything?Well, I’ll unlock your teeth!”"
"他朝科尔内留斯逼近了一步，亮出他手中所持的武器，说：","He advanced a step towards Cornelius, and said, showing him the weapon which he held in his hands,—"
"“你看见这把刀了吗？告诉你，我用它杀了五十多只黑公鸡，我发誓，除了它们，我还要杀掉它们的主人——魔鬼。”","“Do you see this knife?Well, I have killed more than fifty black cocks with it, and I vow I’ll kill their master, the devil, as well as them.”"
"“你这个傻瓜，”科尔内留斯说，“你真打算杀了我？”","“But, you blockhead,” said Cornelius, “will you really kill me?”"
"“我要把你的心挖出来，看看你把我的女儿藏哪儿了。”","“I shall open your heart to see in it the place where you hide my daughter.”"
"说着，格里弗斯疯狂地冲向科尔内留斯，科尔内留斯刚闪到桌后躲过了第一刀，格里弗斯又一边凶神恶煞地恐吓着，一边挥舞着他的大刀，继续发起进攻，尽管他的武器暂时伤不到他，但只要这刀还在这疯子的手里，这个暴徒就有可能把刀刺向他，科尔内留斯当即用紧夹在胳膊下的木棍朝看守持刀的那只手的手腕猛击一下。","Saying this, Gryphus in his frenzy rushed towards Cornelius, who had barely time to retreat behind his table to avoid the first thrust; but as Gryphus continued, with horrid threats, to brandish his huge knife, and as, although out of the reach of his weapon, yet, as long as it remained in the madman’s hand, the ruffian might fling it at him, Cornelius lost no time, and availing himself of the stick, which he held tight under his arm, dealt the jailer a vigorous blow on the wrist of that hand which held the knife."
"刀掉到地上，科尔内留斯一脚踩住了它。","The knife fell to the ground, and Cornelius put his foot on it."
"手腕的疼痛，还有承认自己被制服的耻辱，让格里弗斯不顾一切了，看样子他决意放手一搏，科尔内留斯见状当机立断，选准了可怕的大棒每一次落下的精确位置，英勇沉着地痛打着监狱看守。","Then, as Gryphus seemed bent upon engaging in a struggle which the pain in his wrist, and shame for having allowed himself to be disarmed, would have made desperate, Cornelius took a decisive step, belaboring his jailer with the most heroic self-possession, and selecting the exact spot for every blow of the terrible cudgel."
"没一会儿，格里弗斯就求饶了。　可在他求饶前，他还声嘶力竭地喊着救命，惊动了所有的监狱人员。两个狱卒，一个巡视，还有三四个卫兵立马来了，他们看见科尔内留斯手里还挥舞着棍子，脚下踩着刀。","It was not long before Gryphus begged for mercy.But before begging for mercy, he had lustily roared for help, and his cries had roused all the functionaries of the prison.Two turnkeys, an inspector, and three or four guards, made their appearance all at once, and found Cornelius still using the stick, with the knife under his foot."
"这些目击证人不清楚事情的起因，自然就不会认为科尔内留斯是正当防卫，科尔内留斯看到他们，知道自己彻底完了，已经没法挽回了。","At the sight of these witnesses, who could not know all the circumstances which had provoked and might justify his offence, Cornelius felt that he was irretrievably lost."
"事实上，所有的表象确实对他极为不利。","In fact, appearances were sadly against him."
"不一会儿，科尔内留斯的武器就给夺走了，格里弗斯被人扶着站了起来。他又气又痛，在那里嗷嗷直叫，数着自己背上和肩膀上的瘀伤，那些瘀伤开始肿得像山脊坡面上星星点点的小山包一样了。","In one moment Cornelius was disarmed, and Gryphus raised and supported; and, bellowing with rage and pain, he was able to count on his back and shoulders the bruises which were beginning to swell like the hills dotting the slopes of a mountain ridge."
"犯人对监狱看守施暴的报告当即就写出来了，因为都是格里弗斯的一面之词，这份报告自然不会客气，犯人简直被指控为蓄意谋杀，早有预谋，并公然反抗。","A protocol of the violence practiced by the prisoner against his jailer was immediately drawn up, and as it was made on the depositions of Gryphus, it certainly could not be said to be too tame; the prisoner being charged with neither more nor less than with an attempt to murder, for a long time premeditated, with open rebellion."
"在写指控科尔内留斯的报告时，格里弗斯作完了证，也没必要再呆在那里了，就被几个狱卒带下楼，回到自己的住处，他遍体鳞伤，不停地呻吟着。","Whilst the charge was made out against Cornelius, Gryphus, whose presence was no longer necessary after having made his depositions, was taken down by his turnkeys to his lodge, groaning and covered with bruises."
"趁这工夫，几个押科尔内留斯的好心卫兵，忙着告诉他们的犯人洛维斯坦因的习俗和惯例，其实科尔内留斯同他们一样清楚。当初他一进监狱的大门，就有人给他宣读过狱规，狱规的某些条款他到现在还记得清清楚楚。","During this time, the guards who had seized Cornelius busied themselves in charitably informing their prisoner of the usages and customs of Loewestein, which however he knew as well as they did.The regulations had been read to him at the moment of his entering the prison, and certain articles in them remained fixed in his memory."
"除此之外，他们还告诉他，这狱规在一个叫玛蒂亚斯的犯人身上应用到了极致，这个犯人在一六六八年，也就是五年前，犯了比科尔内留斯犯的轻得多的反抗罪。他觉得汤太烫，就把它泼到了看守长的头上，结果这一浇，麻烦事大了，看守长抹了一把脸，脸上的皮就掉了。","Among other things they told him that this regulation had been carried out to its full extent in the case of a prisoner named Mathias, who in 1668, that is to say, five years before, had committed a much less violent act of rebellion than that of which Cornelius was guilty.He had found his soup too hot, and thrown it at the head of the chief turnkey, who in consequence of this ablution had been put to the inconvenience of having his skin come off as he wiped his face."
"玛蒂亚斯十二小时内就被带出牢房，径直来到监狱看守的门房那儿，在那里办理了离开洛维斯坦因的手续，然后就被押送到一片旷地，那里风景秀丽，可以望见广袤的乡村景致。他们就在那里捆住他的双手，蒙上他的眼睛，让他念了祷文。","Mathias was taken within twelve hours from his cell, then led to the jailer’s lodge, where he was registered as leaving Loewestein, then taken to the Esplanade, from which there is a very fine prospect over a wide expanse of country.There they fettered his hands, bandaged his eyes, and let him say his prayers."
"此后，他们叫他跪下，洛维斯坦因的十二个卫兵，看到长官的手势后，每人敏捷地把一颗火枪子弹射进了他的身体。","Hereupon he was invited to go down on his knees, and the guards of Loewestein, twelve in number, at a sign from a sergeant, very cleverly lodged a musket-ball each in his body."
"经过这一遭，玛蒂亚斯不可避免地当场毙命。","In consequence of this proceeding, Mathias incontinently did then and there die."
"科尔内留斯专心致志地听着这段愉快的往事，他接着说：","Cornelius listened with the greatest attention to this delightful recital, and then said,—"
"“啊！啊！你是说十二小时内？”","“Ah! ah! within twelve hours, you say?”"
"“嗯，如果我没记错的话，第十二个小时的钟还没敲响。”讲这段故事的卫兵说。","“Yes, the twelfth hour had not even struck, if I remember right,” said the guard who had told him the story."
"“谢谢你！”科尔内留斯说。","“Thank you,” said Cornelius."
"这个卫兵脸上还挂着刚才为了渲染他的故事而露出的微笑，这时，他们听到一阵脚步声和马刺叮当作响声，有人上楼来了。","The guard still had the smile on his face with which he accompanied and as it were accentuated his tale, when footsteps and a jingling of spurs were heard ascending the stair-case."
"卫兵们让出一条道让军官进来，军官进科尔内留斯牢房的时候，洛维斯坦因的书记官正在写他的报告。","The guards fell back to allow an officer to pass, who entered the cell of Cornelius at the moment when the clerk of Loewestein was still making out his report."
"“这是十一号吗？”他问。","“Is this No. 11?” he asked."
"“是的，长官。”一个下级军官回答。","“Yes, Captain,” answered a non-commissioned officer."
"“那这就是犯人科尔内留斯·范巴尔莱的牢房了？”","“Then this is the cell of the prisoner Cornelius van Baerle?”"
"“没错，长官。”","“Exactly, Captain.”"
"“犯人在哪儿？”","“Where is the prisoner?”"
"“我在这儿，先生。”科尔内留斯回答，尽管他鼓足了勇气，他的脸色还是变得异常苍白。","“Here I am, sir,” answered Cornelius, growing rather pale, notwithstanding all his courage."
"“你就是科尔内留斯·范巴尔莱医生吗？”他问，这次他是亲自问犯人本人。","“You are Dr. Cornelius van Baerle?” asked he, this time addressing the prisoner himself."
"“是的，先生。”","“Yes, sir.”"
"“那跟我走吧。”","“Then follow me.”"
"“唉！唉！”科尔内留斯叹息着，一想到死，他的心不由得发紧。“在洛维斯坦因监狱，他们行动可真是迅速啊。那个无赖竟然还跟我说十二个小时！”","“Oh! oh!” said Cornelius, whose heart felt oppressed by the first dread of death.“What quick work they make here in the fortress of Loewestein.And the rascal talked to me of twelve hours!”"
"“啊！我跟你说过什么？”那个多嘴的卫兵在罪犯耳边嘀咕。","“Ah! what did I tell you?” whispered the communicative guard in the ear of the culprit."
"“你骗我。”","“A lie.”"
"“怎么呢？”","“How so?”"
"“你跟我说是十二小时。”","“You promised me twelve hours.”"
"“啊，没错，可来的这位是亲王殿下的副官，甚至是最亲密的同伴，范德刚先生。“妈的！他们对可怜的玛蒂亚斯就没这样的礼遇。”","“Ah, yes, but here comes to you an aide-de-camp of his Highness, even one of his most intimate companions Van Deken.Zounds! they did not grant such an honour to poor Mathias.”"
"“来吧，来吧！”科尔内留斯倒抽一口长气，说。“来吧，我要让这些人看看，一个正直的市民，科尔内留斯·德维特的教子，即使挨跟那个玛蒂亚斯一样多的枪子儿，也不会有丝毫的畏惧。”","“Come, come!” said Cornelius, drawing a long breath.“Come, I’ll show to these people that an honest burgher, godson of Cornelius de Witt, can without flinching receive as many musket-balls as that Mathias.”"
"说罢，他高傲地从书记官面前走过，书记官被打断了工作，大着胆子跟军官说：","Saying this, he passed proudly before the clerk, who, being interrupted in his work, ventured to say to the officer,—"
"“可范德刚上尉，这份报告还没写完呢。”","“But, Captain van Deken, the protocol is not yet finished.”"
"“没必要写完了。”军官回答。","“It is not worth while finishing it,” answered the officer."
"“那好吧。”书记官回答，冷静地把自己的纸笔收进一个破旧油腻的文具箱。","“All right,” replied the clerk, philosophically putting up his paper and pen into a greasy and well-worn writing-case."
"“命中注定，”可怜的科尔内留斯想，“在这世上，我不能把自己的名字留给一个孩子、一朵花或者一本书，而只有靠这三样东西，一个人才会永垂不朽。”","“It was written,” thought poor Cornelius, “that I should not in this world give my name either to a child to a flower, or to a book,—the three things by which a man’s memory is perpetuated.”"
"他强压着自己的忧郁思绪，带着一颗坚定的心，高昂着头，跟着那个军官走了。","Repressing his melancholy thoughts, he followed the officer with a resolute heart, and carrying his head erect."
"科尔内留斯数着去旷地要走多少步，后悔刚才没问问那个卫兵到底有多少步，那个人有着当差人特有的殷勤，一定不会不告诉他的。","Cornelius counted the steps which led to the Esplanade, regretting that he had not asked the guard how many there were of them, which the man, in his official complaisance, would not have failed to tell him."
"这个可怜的犯人最担心的，还是在这段路上——在他看来，那条路会把他引向生命旅程的终点——他会看到格里弗斯，却不能见到罗莎。那位父亲眼里会闪烁着怎样凶残的得意，而他女儿的双眼却会因为悲伤黯然失色。","What the poor prisoner was most afraid of during this walk, which he considered as leading him to the end of the journey of life, was to see Gryphus and not to see Rosa.What savage satisfaction would glisten in the eyes of the father, and what sorrow dim those of the daughter!"
"看到他受到这样的惩罚，格里弗斯会多么得意啊！惩罚？这简直是对一个极其正义的行为的野蛮报复，科尔内留斯很满意自己像尽自己的本分一样干了这件正义的事。","How Gryphus would glory in his punishment!Punishment?Rather savage vengeance for an eminently righteous deed, which Cornelius had the satisfaction of having performed as a bounden duty."
"可是罗莎，这个可怜的女孩！难道他死之前，就不能看她一眼？就没有机会给她最后一吻？甚至连告别的机会都没有吗？","But Rosa, poor girl! must he die without a glimpse of her, without an opportunity to give her one last kiss, or even to say one last word of farewell?"
"最糟糕的是，难道他死之前，就没有一丁点儿黑郁金香的消息？难道还要他在天堂里恢复知觉后，却不知道自己该从哪个方向寻找他的郁金香？","And, worst of all, must he die without any intelligence of the black tulip, and regain his consciousness in heaven with no idea in what direction he should look to find it?"
"说实话，在这紧要关头，为了忍住泪水，这个可怜人的心里一定充满了aes triplex（法语，“三倍的黄铜”）——比贺拉斯赋予给初次登上可怕的亚克罗塞罗尼安浅滩的水手还要多。","In truth, to restrain his tears at such a crisis the poor wretch’s heart must have been encased in more of the aes triplex—“the triple brass”—than Horace bestows upon the sailor who first visited the terrifying Acroceraunian shoals."
"科尔内留斯左顾右盼了一番，结果他既没看见罗莎，也没瞧见格里弗斯的踪影。","In vain did Cornelius look to the right and to the left; he saw no sign either of Rosa or Gryphus."
"一到旷地，他就勇敢地环视四周，寻找那些即将成为他行刑人的卫兵，实际上他已经看到十二个士兵聚在一起。可他们并没有列队站好，或者手拿火枪，而是在一块儿愉快地交谈，这让科尔内留斯十分震惊。","On reaching the Esplanade, he bravely looked about for the guards who were to be his executioners, and in reality saw a dozen soldiers assembled.But they were not standing in line, or carrying muskets, but talking together so gayly that Cornelius felt almost shocked."
"突然，格里弗斯跛着脚，杵着一根拐棍，踉踉跄跄地从看守门房里跑出来；他那双苍老的、像猫一样的灰色眼睛突然一亮，凝聚了他所有的仇恨。接着，他开始破口大骂起来，那些不堪入耳的、对科尔内留斯的咒骂如滔滔江水，绵延不绝，科尔内留斯对军官说：","All at once, Gryphus, limping, staggering, and supporting himself on a crooked stick, came forth from the jailer’s lodge; his old eyes, gray as those of a cat, were lit up by a gleam in which all his hatred was concentrated.He then began to pour forth such a torrent of disgusting imprecations against Cornelius, that the latter, addressing the officer, said,—"
"“我觉得这不太合适，先生，让我这样受此人的侮辱，尤其是在这时候。”","“I do not think it very becoming sir, that I should be thus insulted by this man, especially at a moment like this.”"
"“好啦！听我说，”军官笑着说，“这个老家伙这样恨你不是很自然嘛，看样子，你把他打得不轻啊。”","“Well! hear me,” said the officer, laughing, “it is quite natural that this worthy fellow should bear you a grudge,—you seem to have given it him very soundly.”"
"“可是，先生，我只是自卫啊。”","“But, sir, it was only in self-defence.”"
"“没事，”上尉像是一个真正的哲人一样，耸耸肩说，“就让他骂吧。他骂他的，现在跟你又有什么关系呢？”","“Never mind,” said the Captain, shrugging his shoulders like a true philosopher, “let him talk; what does it matter to you now?”"
"听到这话，科尔内留斯额上沁出了冷汗，这话在他看来有点像是无情的讽刺，尤其是这话出自这个军官之口，他之前听说他是亲王的心腹呢。","The cold sweat stood on the brow of Cornelius at this answer, which he looked upon somewhat in the light of brutal irony, especially as coming from an officer of whom he had heard it said that he was attached to the person of the Prince."
"这个不幸的郁金香迷此时觉得，他既无对策，又没有朋友，只有听天由命了。","The unfortunate tulip-fancier then felt that he had no more resources, and no more friends, and resigned himself to his fate."
"“天意难违啊，”他低下头咕哝着；那名军官像是很满足地等着他沉思完，直到科尔内留斯转身问他：","“God’s will be done,” he muttered, bowing his head; then, turning towards the officer, who seemed complacently to wait until he had finished his meditations he asked,—"
"“请告诉我，先生，我这是要去哪儿？”","“Please, sir, tell me now, where am I to go?”"
"军官指了指一辆四匹马拉的马车，这让他特别强烈地想起之前在布伊坦霍夫引起他注意的那辆，也是在相似的情况下。","The officer pointed to a carriage, drawn by four horses, which reminded him very strongly of that which, under similar circumstances, had before attracted his attention at Buytenhof."
"“上车吧！”军官说。","“Enter,” said the officer."
"“啊！”科尔内留斯自言自语道，“看样子他们不打算在旷地处决我了。”","“Ah!” muttered Cornelius to himself, “it seems they are not going to treat me to the honours of the Esplanade.”"
"他说这话的时候声音很大，那个多嘴多舌的卫兵就紧跟其后，他无意中听到了科尔内留斯的话。","He uttered these words loud enough for the chatty guard, who was at his heels, to overhear him."
"那个善良的人很可能认为，自己有责任给科尔内留斯提供点新情报。快走近车门的时候，趁着军官一只脚踩着马车踏板，还在那里下命令的功夫，他低声对范巴尔莱说：","That kind soul very likely thought it his duty to give Cornelius some new information; for, approaching the door of the carriage, whilst the officer, with one foot on the step, was still giving some orders, he whispered to Van Baerle,—"
"“有罪的囚犯有时候会被带到自己的家乡，在自家门口被处决，这样好杀一儆百。这都视情况而定的。”","“Condemned prisoners have sometimes been taken to their own town to be made an example of, and have then been executed before the door of their own house.It’s all according to circumstances.”"
"科尔内留斯做了个手势以示感谢，然后自言自语道：","Cornelius thanked him by signs, and then said to himself,—"
"“唉，这个家伙只要有机会，倒总能安慰安慰人。我真的很感谢你，我的朋友。再见了。”","“Well, here is a fellow who never misses giving consolation whenever an opportunity presents itself.In truth, my friend, I’m very much obliged to you.Goodbye.”"
"马车驶走了。","The carriage drove away."
"“啊！你这个混蛋，你这个强盗！”格里弗斯咆哮着，看着这个犯人从自己的手掌心里溜走，他边挥舞着自己的拳头，边说，“这家伙还没把女儿还给我就走了，这不是耻辱吗？”","“Ah! you villain, you brigand,” roared Gryphus, clinching his fists at the victim who was escaping from his clutches, “is it not a shame that this fellow gets off without having restored my daughter to me?”"
"“他们要是把我带到多特，”科尔内留斯想，“经过我家的时候，我要看看我那可怜的花坛是不是都给毁了。”","“If they take me to Dort,” thought Cornelius, “I shall see, in passing my house, whether my poor borders have been much spoiled.”"
"第三十章 读者开始猜测等待范巴尔莱的是怎样的刑罚","Chapter 30 Wherein the Reader begins to guess the Kind of  Execution that was awaiting Van Baerle"
"第三十一章 哈勒姆","Chapter 31 Haarlem"
"三天前，我们领着亲爱的读者来到了哈勒姆，今天，我们请他再一次同我们一起跟随犯人的脚步来到哈勒姆。哈勒姆是一座美丽的城市，它以荷兰绿化覆盖率最高的城市为傲，真是合情合理。","Haarlem, whither, three days ago, we conducted our gentle reader, and whither we request him to follow us once more in the footsteps of the prisoner, is a pleasant city, which justly prides itself on being one of the most shady in all the Netherlands."
"当别的城镇夸耀自己林立的兵工厂和造船厂，辉煌华丽的商铺和市场时，哈勒姆的成名原因却在于其婀娜的榆树和优雅的杨树，这两种树无论是数量上还是姿态上，都要优于其他外省的城市，尤其是高大的橡树、菩提树、栗子树，郁郁葱葱，在林阴小道上方形成可爱的拱形顶。","While other towns boast of the magnificence of their arsenals and dock-yards, and the splendour of their shops and markets, Haarlem’s claims to fame rest upon her superiority to all other provincial cities in the number and beauty of her spreading elms, graceful poplars, and, more than all, upon her pleasant walks, shaded by the lovely arches of magnificent oaks, lindens, and chestnuts."
"哈勒姆——它的邻居莱顿成为了科学中心，它的女王阿姆斯特丹成为了商业中心，——而哈勒姆则更倾向于成为一个农业城市，更严格说来，成为园艺中心。","Haarlem,—just as her neighbour, Leyden, became the centre of science, and her queen, Amsterdam, that of commerce,—Haarlem preferred to be the agricultural, or, more strictly speaking, the horticultural metropolis."
"事实上，由于它群山环绕，微风拂面，又沐浴在温暖的阳光下，它好像给园艺爱好者提供了更多的成功保障，其他地方不是海水湿气较重，就是骄阳似火，酷热难耐。","In fact, girt about as she was, breezy and exposed to the sun’s hot rays, she seemed to offer to gardeners so many more guarantees of success than other places, with their heavy sea air, and their scorching heat."
"基于此，所有热爱土地和土地果实且崇尚宁静生活的人都聚集在哈勒姆，所有热衷于旅行和商业的，不安分的人都来到了在鹿特丹和阿姆斯特丹，而所有自私世俗的政客们都呆在了海牙。","On this account all the serene souls who loved the earth and its fruits had gradually gathered together at Haarlem, just as all the nervous, uneasy spirits, whose ambition was for travel and commerce, had settled in Rotterdam and Amsterdam, and all the politicians and selfish worldlings at the Hague."
"我们前面说过，莱顿是学者众多的地方。同样地，哈勒姆致力于追求祥和宁静，它热爱音乐和绘画，果园和林阴道，还有树林和公园。哈勒姆为花而狂，而郁金香又是最受其推崇的。","We have observed that Leyden overflowed with scholars.In like manner Haarlem was devoted to the gentle pursuits of peace,—to music and painting, orchards and avenues, groves and parks.Haarlem went wild about flowers, and tulips received their full share of worship."
"哈勒姆为郁金香培植设置了大奖，这自然而然地让我们想到该城市拟于一六七三年五月十五日举行的庆祝会，以纪念完美无瑕的大黑郁金香的诞生，而它也将为它的培植者赢得十万基尔德。","Haarlem offered prizes for tulip-growing; and this fact brings us in the most natural manner to that celebration which the city intended to hold on May 15th, 1673 in honour of the great black tulip, immaculate and perfect, which should gain for its discoverer one hundred thousand guilders!"
"哈勒姆把它的最爱展示在世人面前，宣扬了它对所有花儿的热爱，尤其是对郁金香的情有独钟，在这个人们的灵魂充斥着战争与叛乱的年代，哈勒姆却沉浸在它那高雅的消遣之中，欣赏着最纯洁的郁金香的绽放，哈勒姆，这座满是绿树、阳光、布满光与影的小城，它决定让这个颁奖典礼成为一个让人们永远铭记的节日。","Haarlem, having placed on exhibition its favourite, having advertised its love of flowers in general and of tulips in particular, at a period when the souls of men were filled with war and sedition,—Haarlem, having enjoyed the exquisite pleasure of admiring the very purest ideal of tulips in full bloom,—Haarlem, this tiny town, full of trees and of sunshine, of light and shade, had determined that the ceremony of bestowing the prize should be a fete which should live for ever in the memory of men."
"哈勒姆之所以作这个决定，荷兰之所以能成为节日之乡，还有一个更主要的原因，当娱乐成为主题时，没有哪个地方的人的慵懒个性能比七省联邦那些善良的共和主义者们更能展现出歌舞升平的精力。","So much the more reason was there, too, in her determination, in that Holland is the home of fetes; never did sluggish natures manifest more eager energy of the singing and dancing sort than those of the good republicans of the Seven Provinces when amusement was the order of the day."
"大家可以看看特尼埃斯父子的画。","Study the pictures of the two Teniers."
"当然，所有人中，那些无精打采的人最热衷于把自己折腾得精疲力竭，但不是在他们工作的时候，而是在玩乐时。","It is certain that sluggish folk are of all men the most earnest in tiring themselves, not when they are at work, but at play."
"因为有三件喜事要庆祝，所以哈勒姆也就有了三倍的欢乐。","Thus Haarlem was thrice given over to rejoicing, for a three-fold celebration was to take place."
"首先，有人培植出了黑郁金香；其次，作为地道的荷兰人，奥兰治亲王威廉答应要亲临这场黑郁金香面世典礼；第三，对国人来说，这是件荣誉攸关的事，他们要做给法国看，在经历一六七二年那场灾难性的战争后，巴达维亚共和国的地板仍旧足够结实，可供它的人民伴着他们舰队的隆隆炮声跳舞。","In the first place, the black tulip had been produced; secondly, the Prince William of Orange, as a true Hollander, had promised to be present at the ceremony of its inauguration; and, thirdly, it was a point of honour with the States to show to the French, at the conclusion of such a disastrous war as that of 1672, that the flooring of the Batavian Republic was solid enough for its people to dance on it, with the accompaniment of the cannon of their fleets."
"哈勒姆园艺协会为了证明它名副其实，拿出十万基尔德来嘉奖一个郁金香球茎。哈勒姆也不甘示弱，表决通过了一笔数目相近的款项，交给本城几个要员，好好庆祝这一吉利的盛事。","The Horticultural Society of Haarlem had shown itself worthy of its fame by giving a hundred thousand guilders for the bulb of a tulip.The town, which did not wish to be outdone, voted a like sum, which was placed in the hands of that notable body to solemnise the auspicious event."
"典礼被安排在了星期天，那天确实在民众中引起了轰动，市民们的脸上洋溢着热情，甚至连总爱嘲笑一切的法国人都被感染了，不由得羡慕起那些正直的荷兰人的性格，他们同样也愿意花钱造军舰——更确切地说，那是为了国家荣誉——就像他们要奖励花的一个新品种的诞生一样，它注定会为那天绽放；那天它会吸引众多女士、学者和好奇者的目光。","And indeed on the Sunday fixed for this ceremony there was such a stir among the people, and such an enthusiasm among the townsfolk, that even a Frenchman, who laughs at everything at all times, could not have helped admiring the character of those honest Hollanders, who were equally ready to spend their money for the construction of a man-of-war—that is to say, for the support of national honour—as they were to reward the growth of a new flower, destined to bloom for one day, and to serve during that day to divert the ladies, the learned, and the curious."
"作为那些要员和园艺委员会成员的领导者，范西斯当先生穿上了他最华丽的服饰。","At the head of the notables and of the Horticultural Committee shone Mynheer van Systens, dressed in his richest habiliments."
"这位令人尊敬的先生竭力想使他朴素、端庄、优雅的服饰与他最热爱的黑郁金香交相辉映；我们会这样记载——他做得非常成功——这会让他不胜荣幸的。","The worthy man had done his best to imitate his favourite flower in the sombre and stern elegance of his garments; and we are bound to record, to his honour, that he had perfectly succeeded in his object."
"深红色的天鹅绒，暗紫色的丝绸，墨黑的布料配上炽白光的亚麻，这就是主席节日的盛装，他走在委员会成员的前面，手里拿着一大束花，就像一百二十年后，德罗伯斯庇尔在节日“至高存在”中表现的一样。","Dark crimson velvet, dark purple silk, and jet-black cloth, with linen of dazzling whiteness, composed the festive dress of the President, who marched at the head of his Committee carrying an enormous nosegay, like that which a hundred and twenty-one years later, Monsieur de Robespierre displayed at the festival of “The Supreme Being.”"
"不过这两个人还是有细微的差别，差别在于那个法国领导人当时心中充满了仇恨，报复之心蠢蠢欲动，而我们正直的主席，他的心同手里的花儿一样纯洁无暇。","There was, however, a little difference between the two; very different from the French tribune, whose heart was so full of hatred and ambitious vindictiveness, was the honest President, who carried in his bosom a heart as innocent as the flowers which he held in his hand."
"委员会成员如草原般轻松舒畅，如春天的花园一样芬芳，走在他们后面的是城里的学术团体、地方官员、军队、贵族和农民。","Behind the Committee, who were as gay as a meadow, and as fragrant as a garden in spring, marched the learned societies of the town, the magistrates, the military, the nobles and the boors."
"即使在这样一群受人尊敬的七省联邦共和主义者间，游行队伍中也没有普通百姓的一席之地，他们只能站在街道的两旁。","The people, even among the respected republicans of the Seven Provinces, had no place assigned to them in the procession; they merely lined the streets."
"这就是老百姓的位置，他们本着真正的达观心态，等待着盛装游行的庆祝队伍经过，队伍过去之后他们才知道该说什么，有时候还可以知道该做什么。","This is the place for the multitude, which with true philosophic spirit, waits until the triumphal pageants have passed, to know what to say of them, and sometimes also to know what to do."
"可这一次，既不是庞贝抑或凯撒的凯旋，也不是米特拉达梯的失败，更不是高卢的征服。游行队伍温和得犹如一群羊羔，犹如一群鸟儿划过天际，没有任何攻击性。","This time, however, there was no question either of the triumph of Pompey or of Caesar; neither of the defeat of Mithridates, nor of the conquest of Gaul.The procession was as placid as the passing of a flock of lambs, and as inoffensive as a flight of birds sweeping through the air."
"哈勒姆除了园丁，没有别的胜利者。哈勒姆崇尚鲜花，自然会对花卉爱好者顶礼膜拜。","Haarlem had no other triumphers, except its gardeners.Worshipping flowers, Haarlem idolised the florist."
"黑郁金香就在这平静芬芳的队伍中央，它被人用担架抬着，上面盖着一块有金色流苏的白色天鹅绒。","In the centre of this pacific and fragrant cortege the black tulip was seen, carried on a litter, which was covered with white velvet and fringed with gold."
"担架由四个人抬着，时不时还有人接替，让他们歇息一下，就像古罗马时代，那群在喇叭声和全国人民的崇敬之中，把母亲女神赛比利从埃特鲁里亚抬到“永恒之城”的脚夫们那样，他们也是轮流换班。","The handles of the litter were supported by four men, who were from time to time relieved by fresh relays,—even as the bearers of Mother Cybele used to take turn and turn about at Rome in the ancient days, when she was brought from Etruria to the Eternal City, amid the blare of trumpets and the worship of a whole nation."
"这次郁金香公开展览拜全民所赐，这群不识字又没教养的人，是为了表达对杰出而虔诚的领导人教养和才学的景仰，而布伊坦霍夫广场肮脏的人行道上还沾着那些领导们的血，他们还等待着将来的某天这些受害者的名字会被刻在荷兰先贤祠里最高的石头上。","This public exhibition of the tulip was an act of adoration rendered by an entire nation, unlettered and unrefined, to the refinement and culture of its illustrious and devout leaders, whose blood had stained the foul pavement of the Buytenhof, reserving the right at a future day to inscribe the names of its victims upon the highest stone of the Dutch Pantheon."
"按照安排，总督亲王殿下会亲自颁发这十万基尔德的奖，这可吸引了不少人，大家以为或许他还要作个演讲，这吸引了更多的朋友和敌人。","It was arranged that the Prince Stadtholder himself should give the prize of a hundred thousand guilders, which interested the people at large, and it was thought that perhaps he would make a speech which interested more particularly his friends and enemies."
"因为哪怕这些政治要员说一些最无关痛痒的话，他们的朋友和敌人也总是努力去从中发觉点什么，由此他们认为自己能够理解那些要员的某些真实想法。　","For in the most insignificant words of men of political importance their friends and their opponents always endeavour to detect, and hence think they can interpret, something of their true thoughts."
"就好像真正的政治家都会锋芒毕露似的！","As if your true politician’s hat were not a bushel under which he always hides his light!"
"终于，一六七三年五月十五日，这个期待已久的伟大日子到了。整个哈勒姆，还有邻近一带的人，都聚集在美丽的林阴道上，这次他们决定既不把掌声送给战争英雄，也不献给那些在科技领域取得显著成绩的人，而是要把掌声留给那些战胜自然的人，是他让取之不竭的自然母亲孕育出了曾经被认为不可能的东西——一朵完美的黑郁金香。","At length the great and long-expected day—May 15, 1673—arrived; and all Haarlem, swelled by her neighbours, was gathered in the beautiful tree-lined streets, determined on this occasion not to waste its applause upon military heroes, or those who had won notable victories in the field of science, but to reserve their applause for those who had overcome Nature, and had forced the inexhaustible mother to be delivered of what had theretofore been regarded as impossible,—a completely black tulip."
"然而，没有什么比民众此类的决心更靠不住了。群众有心情喝彩，他们拆你台的时候同样如此。他们从来不知道适可而止。","Nothing however, is more fickle than such a resolution of the people.When a crowd is once in the humour to cheer, it is just the same as when it begins to hiss.It never knows when to stop."
"因此，他们先为范西斯当和他的花束喝彩，为市政委员喝彩，然后又为自己喝彩，最后，他们为在每次休息时演奏悠扬音乐的镇议会绅士们喝彩，不过这一次他们喝彩倒没错。","It therefore, in the first place, cheered Van Systens and his nosegay, then the corporation, then followed a cheer for the people; and, at last, and for once with great justice, there was one for the excellent music with which the gentlemen of the town councils generously treated the assemblage at every halt."
"每一双眼睛都在迫切地搜寻着这次节日的女主角——也就是黑郁金香，和男主角——黑郁金香的培植者。","Every eye was looking eagerly for the heroine of the festival,—that is to say, the black tulip,—and for its hero in the person of the one who had grown it."
"我们前面看到德高望重的范西斯当如此尽心尽责地写着演讲稿，今天他演讲完后，我们的男主角就要出场了，他的出场会和总督本人的出场一样具有轰动效应。","In case this hero should make his appearance after the address we have seen worthy Van Systens at work on so conscientiously, he would not fail to make as much of a sensation as the Stadtholder himself."
"可是，对我们来说，当天庆祝活动的兴趣并不在于我们的朋友范西斯当博学多才的话语，不管他多么能言善辩；也不在于那些身着节日盛装，津津有味地嚼着大蛋糕的年轻公子；也不在于那些啃着熏鳗鱼，就像啃着香草蜜饯条的穷苦青年农民；我们的兴趣也不在那些有着红扑扑的脸庞、象牙色胸脯的可爱荷兰姑娘身上；不在那些之前从未出过家门的矮胖先生们身上；也不在那些从锡兰或爪哇来的面黄肌瘦的旅行者身上；也不在那些用酱瓜解渴的口干舌燥的群众身上；不，就我们而言，此刻的真正情趣，那引人入胜、富有戏剧性的情趣并不在于这一切。","But the interest of the day’s proceedings for us is centred neither in the learned discourse of our friend Van Systens, however eloquent it might be, nor in the young dandies, resplendent in their Sunday clothes, and munching their heavy cakes; nor in the poor young peasants, gnawing smoked eels as if they were sticks of vanilla sweetmeat; neither is our interest in the lovely Dutch girls, with red cheeks and ivory bosoms; nor in the fat, round mynheers, who had never left their homes before; nor in the sallow, thin travellers from Ceylon or Java; nor in the thirsty crowds, who quenched their thirst with pickled cucumbers;—no, so far as we are concerned, the real interest of the situation, the fascinating, dramatic interest, is not to be found here."
"我们的兴趣在园艺协会的一个委员身上，他脸上挂着微笑，容光焕发，腰间别着一朵花，头发梳得油光水滑，穿着一身腥红的衣裳，和他的黑头发、黄皮肤形成鲜明对比，格外引人注目。","Our interest is in a smiling, sparkling face to be seen amid the members of the Horticultural Committee; in the person with a flower in his belt, combed and brushed, and all clad in scarlet,—a colour which makes his black hair and yellow skin stand out in violent contrast."
"这个欣喜若狂、容光焕发的男主角，真是功勋卓越，他可以让人们忘了范西斯当的演讲，甚至连总督的出席都会黯然失色，这个人就是伊萨克·博克斯戴尔，他看到他右前方是被抬着的黑郁金香——那是他所谓的女儿。在他的左边，十万基尔德的金币在一个大钱袋里金光闪闪，他不停地地斜瞄着这两样东西，生怕哪一秒钟看不见他们。","This hero, radiant with rapturous joy, who had the distinguished honour of making the people forget the speech of Van Systens, and even the presence of the Stadtholder, was Isaac Boxtel, who saw, carried on his right before him, the black tulip, his pretended daughter; and on his left, in a large purse, the hundred thousand guilders in glittering gold pieces, towards which he was constantly squinting, fearful of losing sight of them for one moment."
"博克斯戴尔时不时加快自己的步伐，以接近范西斯当。他要沾每个人的光，为自己装点门面，就像他偷罗莎的郁金香就是为了实现自己的荣光，继而发一笔横财一样。","Now and then Boxtel quickened his step to rub elbows for a moment with Van Systens.He borrowed a little importance from everybody to make a kind of false importance for himself, as he had stolen Rosa’s tulip to effect his own glory, and thereby make his fortune."
"再过一刻钟，亲王就要来了，游行队伍将最后一次停下来。等黑郁金香被放上宝座，人们对于郁金香的爱戴甚至会超过对亲王的爱戴，亲王拿出一张装饰华丽的羊皮纸文书，上面写着种植者的名字，而殿下将用响亮的声音正式宣布他博克斯戴尔为奇迹的发现者，宣布荷兰多亏了他博克斯戴尔才使得自然界开出一朵黑色的花儿，这朵花从今往后就被命名为‘博克斯戴尔氏黑郁金香’。","Another quarter of an hour and the Prince will arrive and the procession will halt for the last time; after the tulip is placed on its throne, the Prince, yielding precedence to this rival for the popular adoration, will take a magnificently emblazoned parchment, on which is written the name of the grower; and his Highness, in a loud and audible tone, will proclaim him to be the discoverer of a wonder; that Holland, by the instrumentality of him, Boxtel, has forced Nature to produce a black flower, which shall henceforth be called Tulipa nigra Boxtellea."
"可是，博克斯戴尔的目光还是会时不时地从郁金香和钱袋上离开，他小心翼翼地扫视着人群，因为他最怕在人群中看到美丽的弗里斯兰姑娘罗莎那苍白的脸。","From time to time, however, Boxtel withdrew his eyes for a moment from the tulip and the purse, timidly looking among the crowd, for more than anything he dreaded to descry there the pale face of the pretty Frisian girl."
"她可能会成为破坏他节日喜悦的幽灵，就像班柯的灵魂一直困扰着麦克白一样。","She would have been a spectre spoiling the joy of the festival for him, just as Banquo’s ghost did that of Macbeth."
"不过，说实话，这个偷了一个男人的骄傲，一个女人的嫁妆的混蛋并不认为自己是贼。他曾如此专注地盯着这朵郁金香，从科尔内留斯干燥室的抽屉一路热切地跟到了布伊坦霍夫的断头台，又从断头台追到了洛维斯坦因监狱。他看着它在罗莎窗台上发芽长大，还经常用自己的呼吸温暖它周围的空气，他觉得没有谁比他更有权利称自己为它的培植者。现在谁要是把黑郁金香从他那里拿走，在他看来那才是贼呢。","And yet, if the truth must be told, this wretch, who had stolen what was the boast of man, and the dowry of a woman, did not consider himself as a thief.He had so intently watched this tulip, followed it so eagerly from the drawer in Cornelius’s dry-room to the scaffold of the Buytenhof, and from the scaffold to the fortress of Loewestein; he had seen it bud and grow in Rosa’s window, and so often warmed the air round it with his breath, that he felt as if no one had a better right to call himself its producer than he had; and any one who would now take the black tulip from him would have appeared to him as a thief."
"还好，他没瞧见罗莎，因此他又开心起来了。","Yet he did not perceive Rosa; his joy therefore was not spoiled."
"在一圈装饰着花环和题词的大树的中央，游行队伍在轻快的音乐声中停了下来，年轻的哈勒姆姑娘护送着郁金香过来了，一直把它抬到了台上高高的席位上，旁边就是总督殿下的镀金宝座。","In the centre of a circle of magnificent trees, which were decorated with garlands and inscriptions, the procession halted, amidst the sounds of lively music, and the young damsels of Haarlem made their appearance to escort the tulip to the raised seat which it was to occupy on the platform, by the side of the gilded chair of his Highness the Stadtholder."
"骄傲的郁金香一登上宝座，马上俯瞰着聚集的人群，那些人拍着手，让哈勒姆这座古镇回荡着他们震天的喝彩声。","And the proud tulip, raised on its pedestal, soon overlooked the assembled crowd of people, who clapped their hands, and made the old town of Haarlem re-echo with their tremendous cheers."
"第三十二章 最后的请求","Chapter 32 A Last Request "
"就在这庄严的时刻，耳畔还回响着欢呼声，一辆马车沿着林区外的一条马路驶来，马车行进得很慢，因为人们就在那片林区举行欢庆仪式，成群的孩子被成年男女们挤出了大道。","At this solemn moment, and whilst the cheers still resounded, a carriage was driving along the road on the outskirts of the green on which the scene occurred; it pursued its way slowly, on account of the flocks of children who were pushed out of the avenue by the crowd of men and women."
"这辆马车布满了尘土，车轴嘎吱作响，这是长途跋涉的结果，车上坐着不幸的范巴尔莱，他刚从开着的车窗瞥到我们之前尽力呈现在读者眼前的那个场景，尽管我们很可能描述得不太好。","This carriage, covered with dust, and creaking on its axles, the result of a long journey, enclosed the unfortunate Van Baerle, who was just beginning to get a glimpse through the open window of the scene which we have tried—with poor success, no doubt—to present to the eyes of the reader."
"人群、喧闹声，还有人工或自然的华美展示，对犯人来说，就如同地牢里耀出一道光亮一样，让他目眩头晕。","The crowd and the noise and the display of artificial and natural magnificence were as dazzling to the prisoner as a ray of light flashing suddenly into his dungeon."
"虽然他的同伴不太乐意回答关于他命运的问题，他还是又一次冒昧地问，这么热闹到底是为了什么，虽然乍看起来，这热闹与他毫不相干。","Notwithstanding the little readiness which his companion had shown in answering his questions concerning his fate, he ventured once more to ask the meaning of all this bustle, which at first sight seemed to be utterly disconnected with his own affairs."
"“请问，这儿是干什么啊，上尉先生？”他问他的护送人。　","“What is all this, pray, Mynheer Lieutenant?” he asked of his conductor."
"“先生，你应该看得出来，这是个节日。”军官回答道。","“As you may see, sir,” replied the officer, “it is a feast.”"
"“啊，节日，”科尔内留斯说，语调里透着看淡一切的忧伤，只有了结尘世欢乐的人才会这样。","“Ah, a feast,” said Cornelius, in the sad tone of indifference of a man to whom no joy remains in this world."
"然后他沉默了片刻，马车又往前走了几码，他又问道：","Then, after some moments, silence, during which the carriage had proceeded a few yards, he asked once more,—"
"“这是哈勒姆守护神的节日吗？因为我看见有不少鲜花呢。”","“The feast of the patron saint of Haarlem? as I see so many flowers.”"
"“这的确是一个鲜花唱主角的节日。”","“It is, indeed, a feast in which flowers play a principal part.”"
"“啊，多么醉人的芬芳！啊，多么美丽的色彩！”科尔内留斯叫道。","“Oh, the sweet scents! oh, the beautiful colours!” cried Cornelius."
"“停一停，好让这位先生看看。”军官带着军人特有的直率与友好，对赶车的士兵说。","“Stop, that the gentleman may see,” said the officer, with that frank kindliness which is peculiar to military men, to the soldier who was acting as postilion."
"“啊，谢谢你，先生，谢谢你的好意，”范巴尔莱忧伤地说，“他人的快乐让我痛苦，您就别让我受这份罪了吧。”","“Oh, thank you, Sir, for your kindness,” replied Van Baerle, in a melancholy tone; “the joy of others pains me; please spare me this pang.”"
"“随你的便。那就继续赶路！我叫车夫停车是因为我想你会很乐意看，人们不是说你爱花嘛，尤其是今天节日庆祝的那种花。”","“Just as you wish.Drive on!I ordered the driver to stop because I thought it would please you, as you are said to love flowers, and especially that the feast of which is celebrated to-day.”"
"“那今天庆祝的是什么花呢？”","“And what flower is that?”"
"“郁金香。”","“The tulip.”"
"“郁金香！”范巴尔莱叫道，“今天是郁金香节？”","“The tulip!” cried Van Baerle, “is to-day the feast of tulips?”"
"“是的，先生；不过既然这样的场景让你难受，咱们还是继续赶路吧。”","“Yes, sir; but as this spectacle displeases you, let us drive on.”"
"军官正打算下令继续赶路，可科尔内留斯拦住了他，他脑子里闪过一个痛苦的想法。他用颤抖的声音问：","The officer was about to give the order to proceed, but Cornelius stopped him, a painful thought having struck him.He asked, with faltering voice,—"
"“先生，今天是颁奖吗？”","“Is the prize given to-day, sir?”"
"“是的，颁给黑郁金香的奖。”","“Yes, the prize for the black tulip.”"
"科尔内留斯双颊通红，浑身发抖，额头也冒出了冷汗。","Cornelius’s cheek flushed, his whole frame trembled, and the cold sweat stood on his brow."
"“哎呀！先生，”他说，“这些善良的人们跟我一样不幸，他们不会看到他们本想见证的庄严，至少他们不会看到完整的庄严。”","“Alas! sir,” he said, “all these good people will be as unfortunate as myself, for they will not see the solemnity which they have come to witness, or at least they will see it incompletely.”"
"“你这么说是什么意思？”","“What is it you mean to say?”"
"“我的意思是，”科尔内留斯缩回到马车，答道，“除了我认识的一个人，没有人能培植出黑郁金香。”","“I mean to say.” replied Cornelius, throwing himself back in the carriage, “that the black tulip will not be found, except by one whom I know.”"
"“既然这样，”军官说，“你认识的那个人已经种出来了，因为整个哈勒姆这一刻关注的恰恰是黑郁金香。”","“In this case,” said the officer, “the person whom you know has found it, for the thing which the whole of Haarlem is looking at at this moment is neither more nor less than the black tulip.”"
"“黑郁金香！”范巴尔莱说着，探出半边身子到窗外，“它在哪儿？它在哪儿？”","“The black tulip!” replied Van Baerle, thrusting half his body out of the carriage window.“Where is it? where is it?”"
"“它就在那边的宝座上，你没瞧见吗？”","“Down there on the throne,—don’t you see?”"
"“我看见它了。”","“I do see it.”"
"“赶快，先生！”军官说。“现在咱们得赶路了。”","“Come along, sir,” said the officer.“Now we must drive off.”"
"“啊！先生，您就可怜可怜我，发发慈悲吧！”范巴尔莱说，“不要带我走！让我再看一眼吧！我看到的那儿是黑郁金香吗？完完全全的黑色吗？这可能吗？啊！先生，您看到它了吗？它一定有斑点，一定有瑕疵，它一定只是被染黑的。啊！如果我在那儿，一定能立马断定。让我下车吧，让我近一点看它，我求您了。”","“Oh, have pity, have mercy, sir!” said Van Baerle, “don’t take me away!Let me look once more!Is what I see down there the black tulip?Quite black?Is it possible?Oh, sir, have you seen it?It must have specks, it must be imperfect, it must only be dyed black.Ah! if I were there, I should see it at once.Let me alight, let me see it close, I beg of you.”"
"“先生，你疯了吗？我怎么能答应你这样的请求？”","“Are you mad, Sir?How could I allow such a thing?”"
"“我恳求您。”","“I implore you.”"
"“可你忘了你是犯人。”","“But you forget that you are a prisoner.”"
"“没错儿，我是名犯人，可我是一个正直的人，我向您保证，我不会跑掉的，我不会试图逃跑，——只要您让我看看花儿。”","“It is true I am a prisoner, but I am a man of honour, and I promise you on my word that I will not run away, I will not attempt to escape,—only let me see the flower.”"
"“可这是我的命令，先生，我的命令。”然后，军官又示意车夫继续赶路。","“But my orders, Sir, my orders.”And the officer again made the driver a sign to proceed."
"科尔内留斯又一次拦住了他。","Cornelius stopped him once more."
"“啊！您就宽容一下，开开恩吧！我整个性命都仰仗您的同情了。哎呀！也许我的命也不长了。先生，您不知道我心里的痛楚。您不知道我心里和头脑里有着怎样的挣扎。因为毕竟，”科尔内留斯绝望地喊道，“如果这就是我的郁金香，如果这就是从罗莎那儿偷走的那朵呢！啊！先生，我必须下车！我一定得瞧瞧那花！如果您喜欢，尽可以杀了我，但我一定要看看它，要看看它。”","“Oh, be forbearing, be generous! my whole life depends upon your pity.Alas! perhaps it will not be much longer.You don’t know, sir, what I suffer.You don’t know the struggle going on in my heart and mind.For after all,” Cornelius cried in despair, “if this were my tulip, if it were the one which has been stolen from Rosa!Oh, I must alight, sir!I must see the flower!You may kill me afterwards if you like, but I will see it, I must see it.”"
"“安静，你这倒霉蛋，赶紧回到马车上，总督殿下的护卫队过来了，要是亲王看见有人扰乱治安或者听到什么动静，你和我都要吃不了兜着走。”","“Be quiet, unfortunate man, and come quickly back into the carriage, for here is the escort of his Highness the Stadtholder, and if the Prince observed any disturbance, or heard any noise, it would be ruin to me, as well as to you.”"
"范巴尔莱为自己担心，更为自己的同伴担心，他赶紧回到马车里，可他就只呆了半分钟，前二十个骑兵刚过他就又趴在车窗上，总督一从旁边经过，他就打手势向他哀求。","Van Baerle, more afraid for his companion than himself, threw himself back into the carriage, but he could only keep quiet for half a minute, and the first twenty horsemen had scarcely passed when he again leaned out of the carriage window, gesticulating imploringly towards the Stadtholder at the very moment when he passed."
"威廉还像平时一样，面无表情，恬淡宁静，他正前往林区行使自己作为主席的职责。他手里拿着一卷羊皮纸文书，在这个节日，这文书成了他的指挥棒。","William, impassible and quiet as usual, was proceeding to the green to fulfil his duty as chairman.He held in his hand the roll of parchment, which, on this festive day, had become his baton."
"看到那个人比划着恳求的神态，又或许他认出了陪同那人的军官，殿下命令他的马车停下。","Seeing the man gesticulate with imploring mien, and perhaps also recognising the officer who accompanied him, his Highness ordered his carriage to stop."
"他那喷着鼻息的马匹，立即在离关着范巴尔莱的马车六码远的位置停下了。","In an instant his snorting steeds stood still, at a distance of about six yards from the carriage in which Van Baerle was caged."
"“什么事？”亲王问军官，军官一听到总督的第一道指令，就早已跳下马车，毕恭毕敬地来到总督身边。","“What is this?” the Prince asked the officer, who at the first order of the Stadtholder had jumped out of the carriage, and was respectfully approaching him."
"“殿下，”他大声说，“这是我从洛维斯坦因接来的政治犯，我已经遵照殿下您的吩咐，把他带到哈勒姆来了。”","“Monseigneur,” he cried, “this is the prisoner of state whom I have fetched from Loewestein, and whom I have brought to Haarlem according to your Highness’s command.”"
"“他想干什么？”","“What does he want?”"
"“他恳请能让他在此停留片刻。”","“He entreats for permission to stop here for minute.”"
"“我想看看黑郁金香，殿下，”范巴尔莱紧扣双手说，“等我看到它，等我明白我想知道的事后，如果我必须得死，我也心甘情愿了。不过临死之前，我要为殿下的仁慈祝福，因为殿下能允许我亲眼目睹人们对我作品的赞颂。”","“To see the black tulip, Monseigneur,” said Van Baerle, clasping his hands, “and when I have seen it, when I have seen what I desire to know, I am quite ready to die, if die I must; but in dying I shall bless your Highness’s mercy for having allowed me to witness the glorification of my work.”"
"这两个人在各自马车的窗口会面，确实是很奇怪的场景。一个有卫兵守护着，权力无边，另一个是个犯人，悲惨而不幸；一个就要登上宝座，而另一个却深信自己正在去断头台的路上。","It was, indeed, a curious spectacle to see these two men at the windows of their several carriages; the one surrounded by his guards, and all powerful, the other a prisoner and miserable; the one going to mount a throne, the other believing himself to be on his way to the scaffold."
"威廉冷冷地看着科尔内留斯，听着他急切的请求。","William, looking with his cold glance on Cornelius, listened to his anxious and urgent request."
"然后，他对军官说：","Then addressing himself to the officer, he said,—"
"“这人就是在洛维斯坦因，试图杀死监狱看守的反动囚犯吗？”","“Is this person the mutinous prisoner who has attempted to kill his jailer at Loewestein?”"
"科尔内留斯叹了口气，垂下了头。他那和蔼坦诚的面孔一阵红，一阵白。这个无所不能、无所不知的亲王，一定有凡夫俗子所没有的密使给他报信，亲王已经知道了他的罪行，他的话对科尔内留斯而言，不仅意味着他在劫难逃，还意味着他最后的请求会遭到拒绝。","Cornelius heaved a sigh and hung his head.His good-tempered honest face turned pale and red at the same instant.These words of the all-powerful Prince, who by some secret messenger unavailable to other mortals had already been apprised of his crime, seemed to him to forebode not only his doom, but also the refusal of his last request."
"他没有试图抗争，也不为自己辩解。他在亲王面前表现出孩子般的绝望与无辜，亲王是一个聪慧而心思缜密的人，看着这动人的场景，他完全理解并感受到了这一切。","He did not try to make a struggle, or to defend himself; and he presented to the Prince the affecting spectacle of despairing innocence, like that of a child,—a spectacle which was fully understood and felt by the great mind and the great heart of him who observed it."
"“让犯人下车吧，就让他看看黑郁金香；它真是值得一看。”","“Allow the prisoner to alight, and let him see the black tulip; it is well worth being seen once.”"
"“谢谢你，殿下，谢谢你！”科尔内留斯说着，高兴得差点儿昏过去，他踉踉跄跄地从马车的踏梯上下来。要不是军官扶着他，恐怕我们可怜的朋友要对殿下三跪九叩地谢恩呢。","“Thank you, Monseigneur, thank you,” said Cornelius, nearly swooning with joy, and staggering on the steps of his carriage; had not the officer supported him, our poor friend would have made his thanks to his Highness prostrate on his knees with his forehead in the dust."
"亲王在准许科尔内留斯后，在热烈的欢呼声中，继续朝林区前行。","After having granted this permission, the Prince proceeded on his way over the green amidst the most enthusiastic acclamations."
"他很快来到了台上，轰隆隆的炮声响彻云霄。","He soon arrived at the platform, and the thunder of cannon shook the air."
"第三十三章 尾声","Chapter 33 Conclusion"
"四个卫兵领着范巴尔莱，从人群中开出一条路来，悄悄地朝黑郁金香走去，范巴尔莱离郁金香越近，他就越饶有兴致地凝视着它。","Van Baerle, led by four guards, who pushed their way through the crowd, sidled up to the black tulip, towards which his gaze was attracted with increasing interest the nearer he approached to it."
"他终于看到它了，那朵独一无二的花儿，今天一睹芳容后，今后将无缘再见。他在离它六步远的地方注视着它，为它的完美与优雅而高兴。他看到它被一群年轻貌美的女孩儿簇拥着，就像高贵纯洁的女王被仪仗队护卫着。然而，他越是亲眼证实花儿的完美，他就越伤心沮丧。他环顾四周，想找一个人，就问他一个问题，可他目光所及之处，都是陌生的面孔，所有人的注意力都集中在坐在元首宝座上的总督身上。","He saw it at last, that unique flower, which he was to see once and no more.He saw it at the distance of six paces, and was delighted with its perfection and gracefulness; he saw it surrounded by young and beautiful girls, who formed, as it were, a guard of honour for this queen of excellence and purity.And yet, the more he ascertained with his own eyes the perfection of the flower, the more wretched and miserable he felt.He looked all around for some one to whom he might address only one question, but his eyes everywhere met strange faces, and the attention of all was directed towards the chair of state, on which the Stadtholder had seated himself."
"威廉起身，平静地扫视着狂热的群众，他犀利的目光交替停留在三角形的三个顶点上，这个三角形是由他对面三个兴致和感受截然不同的人组成的。　","William rose, casting a tranquil glance over the enthusiastic crowd, and his keen eyes rested by turns on the three extremities of a triangle formed opposite to him by three persons of very different interests and feelings."
"其中一个角是博克斯戴尔，他很焦虑不安，且全神贯注地望着亲王、奖金、黑郁金香和人群。","At one of the angles, Boxtel, trembling with impatience, and quite absorbed in watching the Prince, the guilders, the black tulip, and the crowd."
"另一端是科尔内留斯，他喘着气，一声不吭，他的注意力、他的目光、他的生命、他的灵魂、他的爱情都集聚在黑郁金香上。","At the other, Cornelius, panting for breath, silent, and his attention, his eyes, his life, his heart, his love, quite concentrated on the black tulip."
"第三个角上，在一群站在看台上的哈勒姆姑娘中间，是一个美丽的弗里斯兰姑娘，她穿着一件制作精细、红色绣银花的羊毛裙，面纱从金色织锦的帽子上波浪似的披洒下来，盖住了面庞。总而言之，罗莎激动得热泪盈眶，快要晕过去了，她靠在威廉手下一个军官的臂膀上。","And thirdly, standing on a raised step among the maidens of Haarlem, a beautiful Frisian girl, dressed in fine scarlet woollen cloth, embroidered with silver, and covered with a lace veil, which fell in rich folds from her head-dress of gold brocade; in one word, Rosa, who, faint and with swimming eyes, was leaning on the arm of one of the officers of William."
"于是，亲王缓缓地打开了那张羊皮纸，开始平静地讲话，声音虽小，但足够清晰，让在场的那些毕恭毕敬、鸦雀无声的人们能清楚地听到，那声音立马让全场五万观众屏住了呼吸，他说道：","The Prince then slowly unfolded the parchment, and said, with a calm clear voice, which, although low, made itself perfectly heard amidst the respectful silence, which all at once arrested the breath of fifty thousand spectators.—"
"“你们知道，是什么让我们相聚在这里？”","“You know what has brought us here?"
"“我们曾经许诺，谁培植出黑郁金香，谁就能得到十万基尔德的奖金。”","“A prize of one hundred thousand guilders has been promised to whosoever should grow the black tulip."
"“黑郁金香已经种出来了，现在它就在你们眼前，完全符合哈勒姆园艺协会规定的条件。","“The black tulip has been grown; here it is before your eyes, coming up to all the conditions required by the programme of the Horticultural Society of Haarlem."
"“它的种植经过以及种植者的姓名都将会被记载在本城的地方志上。","“The history of its production, and the name of its grower, will be inscribed in the book of honour of the city."
"“有请黑郁金香的拥有者上台。”","“Let the person approach to whom the black tulip belongs.”"
"话音刚落，亲王为了看看他此话的效果，用他敏锐的目光审视着三角形的三个顶点。","In pronouncing these words, the Prince, to judge of the effect they produced, surveyed with his eagle eye the three extremities of the triangle."
"他看到博克斯戴尔冲到前面。他看到科尔内留斯不由自主地动了一下，最后他又看到那个刚刚照顾罗莎的军官，他领着她，确切地说，是把她推到自己跟前。","He saw Boxtel rushing forward.He saw Cornelius make an involuntary movement; and lastly he saw the officer who was taking care of Rosa lead, or rather push her forward towards him."
"一看到罗莎，亲王左右两旁几乎同时响起惊叫声。","At the sight of Rosa, a double cry arose on the right and left of the Prince."
"博克斯戴尔吓坏了，而科尔内留斯高兴坏了，两个不约而同地喊道：","Boxtel, thunderstruck, and Cornelius, in joyful amazement, both exclaimed,—"
"“罗莎！罗莎！”","“Rosa! Rosa!”"
"“这朵郁金香是你培养的，对吧，我的孩子？”亲王问。","“This tulip is yours, is it not, my child?” said the Prince."
"“是的，殿下。”罗莎结结巴巴地说，她的惊艳亮相引得全场的人低声赞扬。","“Yes, Monseigneur,” stammered Rosa, whose striking beauty excited a general murmur of applause."
"“啊！”科尔内留斯咕哝着，“她骗了我，她跟我说有人把这花从她那儿偷走了。啊！这就是她离开洛维斯坦因的原因。啊！我还以为她是这世上我最好的朋友，我居然被她遗忘了，出卖了！”","“Oh!” muttered Cornelius, “she has then belied me, when she said this flower was stolen from her.Oh! that’s why she left Loewestein.Alas! am I then forgotten, betrayed by her whom I thought my best friend on earth?”"
"“啊！”博克斯戴尔叹着气，“我完蛋了！”","“Oh!” sighed Boxtel, “I am lost.”"
"“这郁金香，”亲王接着说，“将会以它培育者的名字命名，将会以‘罗莎范巴尔莱氏黑郁金香’的名称出现在目录册上，因为范巴尔莱这个名字今后将成为这位姑娘的姓。”","“This tulip,” continued the Prince, “will therefore bear the name of its producer, and figure in the catalogue under the title, Tulipa nigra Rosa Barlaensis, because of the name Van Baerle, which will henceforth be the name of this damsel.”"
"说着，威廉把罗莎的手交到一个年轻人手里，这个年轻人乐不可支，脸色苍白，他奔到宝座脚下，先后向亲王和自己的新娘行礼，然后他充满感激地仰望天空，感谢上帝赐予他的所有幸福。","And at the same time William took Rosa’s hand, and placed it in that of a young man, who rushed forth, pale and beyond himself with joy, to the foot of the throne saluting alternately the Prince and his bride; and who with a grateful look to heaven, returned his thanks to the Giver of all this happiness."
"与此同时，另一个人在主席范西斯当的脚下倒下了，因为他受到截然不同的感情打击。","At the same moment there fell at the feet of the President van Systens another man, struck down by a very different emotion."
"博克斯戴尔的希望破灭了，他躺在地上，不省人事。","Boxtel, crushed by the failure of his hopes, lay senseless on the ground."
"当人们扶起他，检查他的脉搏和心跳的时候，发现他已经死了。","When they raised him, and examined his pulse and his heart, he was quite dead."
"但这个小插曲并没有影响到节日的氛围，因为不论亲王还是主席，似乎都没有把这事放在心上。","This incident did not much disturb the festival, as neither the Prince nor the President seemed to mind it much."
"当科尔内留斯认出那个贼，那个假冒的雅各布就是自己的邻居伊萨克·博克斯戴尔时，他惊愕地直往后退，心地纯洁的他一刻都没有怀疑过自己的邻居会有这样无耻的行径。","Cornelius started back in dismay, when in the thief, in the pretended Jacob, he recognised his neighbour, Isaac Boxtel, whom, in the innocence of his heart, he had not for one instant suspected of such a wicked action."
"于是，游行队伍又伴随着喇叭声往回走，队列顺序并无变化，除了那个博克斯戴尔现在死了，还有科尔内留斯和罗莎两人肩并着肩、手牵着手，欢欣鼓舞地走着。","Then, to the sound of trumpets, the procession marched back without any change in its order, except that Boxtel was now dead, and that Cornelius and Rosa were walking triumphantly side by side and hand in hand."
"他们一到市政旅馆，亲王就指了指那装着十万基尔德的钱袋，对科尔内留斯说：","On their arriving at the Hotel de Ville, the Prince, pointing with his finger to the purse with the hundred thousand guilders, said to Cornelius,—"
"“很难说这钱到底该归谁，该你还是罗莎，因为是你发现了黑郁金香的培植方法，是她培育了它并让它开了花。因此如果把这十万基尔德当作她的嫁妆就不太公平了，这是哈勒姆市给郁金香的礼物。”","“It is difficult to say by whom this money is gained, by you or by Rosa; for if you have found the black tulip, she has nursed it and brought it into flower.It would therefore be unjust to consider it as her dowry; it is the gift of the town of Haarlem to the tulip.”"
"科尔内留斯不太明白亲王到底想说什么。亲王接着说：","Cornelius wondered what the Prince was driving at.The latter continued,—"
"“我把这十万基尔德给罗莎，这是她应得的，她也可以把钱给你。这是对她的爱情、勇气和诚实的奖励。至于你，先生，你应该谢谢罗莎，是她提供证据，证明了你的清白。”","“I give to Rosa the sum of a hundred thousand guilders, which she has fairly earned, and which she can offer to you.They are the reward of her love, her courage, and her honesty.As to you, Sir—thanks to Rosa again, who has furnished the proofs of your innocence—”"
"说着，亲王递给科尔内留斯一张《圣经》上撕下的扉页，那上面是科尔内留斯·德维特写的信，这正是曾包着三个球茎的那张纸。","And, saying these words, the Prince handed to Cornelius that fly-leaf of the Bible on which was written the letter of Cornelius de Witt, and in which the third bulb had been wrapped,—"
"“至于你，现在真相大白了，你因为一桩你没犯的罪行而被监禁。这意味着你不仅自由了，而且你的财产也会归还给你，因为一个清白的人的财产是不能充公的。科尔内留斯·范巴尔莱，你是科尔内留斯·德维特的教子，也是他弟弟约翰·德维特的朋友。你不要辜负他们其中一位给你的这个名字，也不要辜负另外一位给你的友谊。德维特两兄弟，因为民众一时的错误，受到了不公正的判决和处罚，他们两个是伟大的公民，现在是我们荷兰的骄傲。”","“As to you, it has come to light that you were imprisoned for a crime which you had not committed.This means, that you are not only free, but that your property will be restored to you; as the property of an innocent man cannot be confiscated.Cornelius van Baerle, you are the godson of Cornelius de Witt and the friend of his brother John.Remain worthy of the name you have received from one of them, and of the friendship you have enjoyed with the other.The two De Witts, wrongly judged and wrongly punished in a moment of popular error, were two great citizens, of whom Holland is now proud.”"
"亲王一反常态，饱含深情地说完后面这番话后，他伸出手让跪在他面前的那对情侣亲吻。","The Prince, after these last words, which contrary to his custom, he pronounced with a voice full of emotion, gave his hands to the lovers to kiss, whilst they were kneeling before him."
"然后他舒了口气，说道：","Then heaving a sigh, he said,—"
"“哎呀！你们真幸福，你们的唯一梦想或许正是荷兰的真正荣耀，特别是，这构成了她真正的幸福，你们就心无旁骛地为荷兰培育新的其他颜色的郁金香吧。”","“Alas! you are very happy, who, dreaming only of what perhaps is the true glory of Holland, and forms especially her true happiness, do not attempt to acquire for her anything beyond new colours of tulips.”"
"他瞥了一眼指南针所指的法国方向，仿佛看到那里又风起云涌似的，就上马车走了。","And, casting a glance towards that point of the compass where France lay, as if he saw new clouds gathering there, he entered his carriage and drove off."
"科尔内留斯即日就与罗莎动身回多特，罗莎还让她恋人的老管家给自己的爸爸送信，告知他发生的一切。","Cornelius started on the same day for Dort with Rosa, who sent her lover’s old housekeeper as a messenger to her father, to apprise him of all that had taken place."
"按照我们之前讲述的，那些了解老格里弗斯脾气的人，会理解他跟他的女婿很难和解。他还没忘记，在那次出了名的遭遇中，他挨的棍子。从瘀痕来看，他数了一下，说有四十一处之多。但后来，诚如他所说，为了表现得和总督大人一样宽宏大量，他答应讲和。","Those who, thanks to our description, have learned the character of old Gryphus, will comprehend that it was hard for him to become reconciled to his son-in-law.He had not yet forgotten the blows which he had received in that famous encounter.To judge from the weals which he counted, their number, he said, amounted to forty-one; but at last, in order, as he declared, not to be less generous than his Highness the Stadtholder, he consented to make his peace."
"这个老家伙被安排看守郁金香，他成了整个七省联邦最粗暴的花园看守。","Appointed to watch over the tulips, the old man made the rudest keeper of flowers in the whole of the Seven Provinces."
"我们真应该看看，他是如何监视那些可恶的蛾子和蝴蝶，怎么杀死蛞蝓，赶走饥饿的蜜蜂的。","It was indeed a sight to see him watching the obnoxious moths and butterflies, killing slugs, and driving away the hungry bees."
"当他得知博克斯戴尔的所作所为，知道自己被那个假冒的雅各布骗了后，暴跳如雷，那个妒忌鬼伊萨克曾为监视他的花园，躲在那棵西克莫无花果树后，他把那棵树给毁了，因为那块曾属于伊萨克的地已经被科尔内留斯买了下来，并入了自己的花园。","As he had heard Boxtel’s story, and was furious at having been the dupe of the pretended Jacob, he destroyed the sycamore behind which the envious Isaac had spied into the garden; for the plot of ground belonging to him had been bought by Cornelius, and taken into his own garden."
"罗莎不仅越来越漂亮了，学问见识也与日俱增。结婚两年后，她不仅能读会写，还能独自承担起她两个漂亮孩子的教育，一个孩子是一六七四年生的，另一个是一六七五年生的，两个孩子都是在鲜花盛开的五月出生。","Rosa, growing not only in beauty, but in wisdom also, after two years of her married life, could read and write so well that she was able to undertake by herself the education of two beautiful children which she had borne in 1674 and 1675, both in May, the month of flowers."
"一个是男孩，叫科尔内留斯，另一个是女孩，取名为罗莎，这也是理所当然的事。","As a matter of course, one was a boy, the other a girl, the former being called Cornelius, the other Rosa."
"范巴尔莱还是一心一意地爱着罗莎和他的郁金香。他一生只致力于妻子的幸福和鲜花培育，在鲜花的培育方面，他又成功地培育出了不少新品种，都被收入了荷兰花卉名录。","Van Baerle remained faithfully attached to Rosa and to his tulips.The whole of his life was devoted to the happiness of his wife and the culture of flowers, in the latter of which occupations he was so successful that a great number of his varieties found a place in the catalogue of Holland."
"他客厅的两个主要装饰物就是两个大金色相框，里面嵌着科尔内留斯·德维特《圣经》上撕下的两张纸，一张纸是他教父写给他的信，命令他烧掉与德卢瓦侯爵的通信，另一张是他自己的遗嘱，遗嘱里说要把郁金香球茎赠与罗莎，条件是她得嫁一个既爱她，她也中意的二十六到二十八岁的小伙子，这一条件总算是严格实现了，尽管，或者应该说，正是因为科尔内留斯没有死。","The two principal ornaments of his drawing-room were those two leaves from the Bible of Cornelius de Witt, in large golden frames; one of them containing the letter in which his godfather enjoined him to burn the correspondence of the Marquis de Louvois, and the other his own will, in which he bequeathed to Rosa his bulbs under condition that she should marry a young man of from twenty-six to twenty-eight years, who loved her and whom she loved, a condition which was scrupulously fulfilled, although, or rather because, Cornelius did not die."
"为了避开像伊萨克·博克斯戴尔那样因嫉妒而心生歹意的人，他在门口写下了格劳秀斯逃走那天在监狱的墙上刻下的句子：","And to ward off any envious attempts of another Isaac Boxtel, he wrote over his door the lines which Grotius had, on the day of his flight, scratched on the walls of his prison:—"
"“有时候一个人承受了太多的苦难，以至于他有权永远缄口不提‘我很幸福’这句话。”","“Sometimes one has suffered so much that he has the right never to be able to say, ‘I am too happy.’”"
