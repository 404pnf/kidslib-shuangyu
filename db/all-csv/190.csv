"形体的永恒","The Eternity of Forms"
"作者：杰克·伦敦","by Jack London"
"随着克雷顿山上的塞德利·克雷顿先生的死，一个离奇的生命走到了尽头。","A strange life has come to an end in the death of Mr. Sedley Crayden, of Crayden Hill."
"在他生命的最后两年里，他温和无害地呆在自己的座椅里，日夜承受着一种奇怪的幻觉的折磨。他哥哥詹姆斯·克雷顿诡异的死亡，确切地说，是失踪，似乎一直折磨着他，因为那场事故发生不久，他的幻觉就开始显现。","Mild, harmless, he was the victim of a strange delusion that kept him pinned, night and day, in his chair for the last two years of his life.The mysterious death, or, rather, disappearance, of his elder brother, James Crayden, seems to have preyed upon his mind, for it was shortly after that event that his delusion began to manifest itself."
"克雷顿先生从未为他匪夷所思的行为解释过什么。他的身体没问题，而在精神方面，精神医生发现除了他那引人注意的怪癖之外，其他各方面都正常。呆在椅子上是他完全自愿的、遵从个人意志的一种行为。现在他离世了，这个谜还是没解开。","Mr. Crayden never vouchsafed any explanation of his strange conduct.There was nothing the matter with him physically; and, mentally, the alienists found him normal in every way save for his one remarkable idiosyncrasy.His remaining in his chair was purely voluntary, an act of his own will.And now he is dead, and the mystery remains unsolved."
"——摘自《牛顿通讯时报》","—Extract from the Newton Courier-Times."
"简单地说，我是塞德利·克雷顿先生的心腹仆人，在他生前的最后八个月里贴身照顾他。那段时间里他写了大量手稿，一直随身携带，除了打瞌睡或熟睡的时候，他总是把它锁在触手可及的书桌抽屉里。","Briefly, I was Mr. Sedley Crayden’s confidential servant and valet for the last eight months of his life.During that time he wrote a great deal in a manuscript that he kept always beside him, except when he drowsed or slept, at which times he invariably locked it in a desk drawer close to his hand."
"我很想读读这位老先生写的东西，但是他太谨慎太狡猾了。这些文件我连瞥都没能瞥上一眼。要是我服侍他的时候他在写东西，他就会用一本大大的记事薄压着最上面一页。是我发现他死在自己的椅子上的，就在那时，我擅自选读了这份手稿。毫无原因的，我就是很好奇地想读。","I was curious to read what the old gentleman wrote, but he was too cautious and cunning.I never got a peep at the manuscript.If he were engaged upon it when I attended on him, he covered the top sheet with a large blotter.It was I who found him dead in his chair, and it was then that I took the liberty of abstracting the manuscript.I was very curious to read it, and I have no excuses to offer."
"偷偷收藏了几年后，在确认了克雷顿先生没有健在的亲戚后，我决定让手稿的本质大白天下。它很长，我几乎省略了所有内容，只留下了那些比较明晰的片段。这部手稿带有神经错乱者的全部特征，许多事被一而再再而三地重复，很多都含糊不清，语无伦次，难以理解。然而，亲自读了以后，我敢推断，如果在主地下室，就在大烟囱的地基附近挖掘，就可以找到一堆与詹姆斯·克雷顿先生血肉包裹的骨骼极其相近的白骨。","After retaining it in my secret possession for several years, and after ascertaining that Mr. Crayden left no surviving relatives, I have decided to make the nature of the manuscript known.It is very long, and I have omitted nearly all of it, giving only the more lucid fragments.It bears all the earmarks of a disordered mind, and various experiences are repeated over and over, while much is so vague and incoherent as to defy comprehension.Nevertheless, from reading it myself, I venture to predict that if an excavation is made in the main basement, somewhere in the vicinity of the foundation of the great chimney, a collection of bones will be found which should very closely resemble those which James Crayden once clothed in mortal flesh."
"——鲁道夫·赫克勒的陈述","—Statement of Rudolph Heckler."
"下面是鲁道夫·赫克勒摘选并整理的手稿选录：","Here follows the excerpts from the manuscript, made and arranged by Rudolph Heckler:"
"我绝未杀害我哥哥。我自始至终坚持这一点。我为什么要杀他？我们在一起非常和睦地过了二十年。我们老了，年轻时的火气和脾性早就消磨殆尽了。我们从未起过争端，哪怕在鸡毛蒜皮的小事上。不会有比我们更亲密的了。我们是学者。外界的事我们一概不关心。有彼此的相伴和书本，我们就很知足了。我们之间的谈话独一无二。许多个夜里我们坐着直到两三点，促膝谈心，斟酌观点、决策，谈论时局。总之，我们的精神高度契合，充满友爱。","I never killed my brother.Let this be my first word and my last.Why should I kill him?We lived together in unbroken harmony for twenty years.We were old men, and the fires and tempers of youth had long since burned out.We never disagreed even over the most trivial things.Never was there such amity as ours.We were scholars.We cared nothing for the outside world.Our companionship and our books were all-satisfying.Never were there such talks as we held.Many a night we have sat up till two and three in the morning, conversing, weighing opinions and judgments, referring to authorities—in short, we lived at high and friendly intellectual altitudes."
"他失踪了。我受了很大刺激。他为什么不见了？他会去哪儿呢？太奇怪了。我很震惊。他们说我大病了几周。是脑膜炎。这是他那难以解释的失踪造成的。一开始我希望这场病与他的失踪有关。","He disappeared.I suffered a great shock.Why should he have disappeared?Where could he have gone?It was very strange.I was stunned.They say I was very sick for weeks.It was brain fever.This was caused by his inexplicable disappearance.It was at the beginning of the experience I hope here to relate, that he disappeared."
"为了找他我付出了多少努力啊。我不是个十分有钱的人，但允诺的酬金却持续上涨。我在所有的报纸上登告示，还找了所有的侦探事务所寻求帮助。目前我许诺支付的酬金一共有五万多美元了。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　","How I have endeavoured to find him.I am not an excessively rich man, yet have I offered continually increasing rewards.I have advertised in all the papers, and sought the aid of all the detective bureaus.At the present moment, the rewards I have out aggregate over fifty thousand dollars."
"他们说他被谋杀了。他们还说罪行终将败露。我就问，为什么他的谋杀案还没有破？谁干的？他在哪？吉姆在哪？我的吉姆呢？","They say he was murdered.They also say murder will out.Then I say, why does not his murder come out?Who did it?Where is he?Where is Jim?My Jim?"
"我们在一起是如此快乐。他思维出众，极其出众，基础扎实，见多识广，逻辑严谨，所以我们事事见解一致，这一点儿也不奇怪。我们之间没有分歧。吉姆是我见过的最真诚的人。在这方面我们也很相像，就像我们在求知上的态度都很诚实一样。我们从不会为证明自己的观点而背叛事实。我们没有观点需要证明，我们完全一致。认为我们会对普天下的任何一件事情意见不一，这种想法太荒谬了。","We were so happy together.He had a remarkable mind, a most remarkable mind, so firmly founded, so widely informed, so rigidly logical, that it was not at all strange that we agreed in all things.Dissension was unknown between us.Jim was the most truthful man I have ever met.In this, too, we were similar, as we were similar in our intellectual honesty.We never sacrificed truth to make a point.We had no points to make, we so thoroughly agreed.It is absurd to think that we could disagree on anything under the sun."
"我希望他能够回来。他为什么走了？谁能够解释？现在我很孤单，因严重的不祥预感而抑郁——被脑子里的恐惧和将我想象的一切化为乌有的恐惧所惊扰。形体是会变的。这是实证科学的定论。逝者不再来。这是无可争议的。死的死去了，这就是结局，也是所有人的结局。可是我在这里已经经历过了，就是这里，就在这间房间里，这张桌子旁——但是等等。让我用白纸黑字写下来吧，用简单的、不会引起误解的话。让我问几个问题。谁把我的笔乱放了？我很想知道。谁这么快就用完了我的墨水？不是我。但是墨水用掉了。","I wish he would come back.Why did he go?Who can ever explain it?I am lonely now, and depressed with grave forebodings—frightened by terrors that are of the mind and that put at naught all that my mind has ever conceived.Form is mutable.This is the last word of positive science.The dead do not come back.This is incontrovertible.The dead are dead, and that is the end of it, and of them.And yet I have had experiences here—here, in this very room, at this very desk, that—But wait.Let me put it down in black and white, in words simple and unmistakable.Let me ask some questions.Who mislays my pen?That is what I desire to know.Who uses up my ink so rapidly?Not I.And yet the ink goes."
"这些问题的答案足以解开世界上所有的谜。我知道答案。我不是傻子。总有一天，如果我受折磨到绝望了，就会自己公布答案。我会说出放错了我的笔、用光了我墨水的那个人的名字。认为我能用掉这么多的墨水，这想法太愚蠢了。仆人撒谎了。我知道。","The answer to these questions would settle all the enigmas of the universe.I know the answer.I am not a fool.And some day, if I am plagued too desperately, I shall give the answer myself.I shall give the name of him who mislays my pen and uses up my ink.It is so silly to think that I could use such a quantity of ink.The servant lies.I know."
"我给自己买了支钢笔。我一直都不喜欢这种东西，但是我的旧蘸水笔已经没有了。我把它扔进壁炉里烧掉了。我妥善地保管着墨水。我要看看自己能不能制止住那些关于我的谎言。我还有别的办法。我并未公开认错。我仍旧相信自己生活在一个机械的宇宙之中。还没有事情证明和我的看法相左，因为我从他肩头看过去，读到了他与之相反的恶毒观点。他认为我是只个普通的傻子。他认为我觉得他真的存在。多傻。我知道他只是虚构的，仅此而已。","I have got me a fountain pen.I have always disliked the device, but my old stub had to go.I burned it in the fireplace.The ink I keep under lock and key.I shall see if I cannot put a stop to these lies that are being written about me.And I have other plans.It is not true that I have recanted.I still believe that I live in a mechanical universe.It has not been proved otherwise to me, for all that I have peered over his shoulder and read his malicious statement to the contrary.He gives me credit for no less than average stupidity.He thinks I think he is real.How silly.I know he is a brain-figment, nothing more."
"有些东西，就是幻觉。即便我从他的肩头看过去，读他写的东西时，我也知道那是幻觉。如果我一切都好，那就有意思了．我一生都在盼望着经历这种事。现在它来了。我要充分利用它。想象是什么？它能够无中生有。怎么能够无中生有呢？怎么能同时把东西变出来又变没呢？我把这个问题留给玄学家们去思考。我对此更了解。对我来说不存在经院哲学。这是个真实的世界，里面的每一个事物都是真实的。不真实的事物是不存在的。因此他不存在。然而他想骗我，相信他真的存在……我却一直都清楚他只存在于我的脑细胞里，在此之外只是虚无。","There are such things as hallucinations.Even as I looked over his shoulder and read, I knew that this was such a thing.If I were only well it would be interesting.All my life I have wanted to experience such phenomena.And now it has come to me.I shall make the most of it.What is imagination?It can make something where there is nothing.How can anything be something where there is nothing?How can anything be something and nothing at the same time?I leave it for the metaphysicians to ponder.I know better.No scholastics for me.This is a real world, and everything in it is real.What is not real, is not.Therefore he is not.Yet he tries to fool me into believing that he is...when all the time I know he has no existence outside of my own brain cells."
"今天我看到他坐在桌旁写东西。这场景吓了我一跳，因为我以为他已经被赶走了。然而死死盯了一会后，我发现他并不在那里——只是我的脑子玩的老把戏。我总是想着已经发生的事情。我变得越来越病态，消化不良的老毛病也开始隐隐发作，暗自侵扰。我该锻炼身体了。每天应该散步两小时。","I saw him to-day, seated at the desk, writing.It gave me quite a shock, because I had thought he was quite dispelled.Nevertheless, on looking steadily, I found that he was not there—the old familiar trick of the brain.I have dwelt too long on what has happened.I am becoming morbid, and my old indigestion is hinting and muttering.I shall take exercise.Each day I shall walk for two hours."
"不可能。我不能锻炼。每次我散步回来，他都坐在桌旁我的椅子上。赶走他了越来越难了。那是我的椅子。我坚持这点。它曾经属于他，但是他死了，它就不再是他的了。一个人怎么能被自己想象出的幻象愚弄呢！这个幻影是不真实的。我知道。我有自己五十年的研究做有力的支撑。死了就是死了。","It is impossible.I cannot exercise.Each time I return from my walk, he is sitting in my chair at the desk.It grows more difficult to drive him away.It is my chair.Upon this I insist.It was his, but he is dead and it is no longer his.How one can be befooled by the phantoms of his own imagining!There is nothing real in this apparition.I know it.I am firmly grounded with my fifty years of study.The dead are dead."
"然而，有一件事要解释。今天在离开房间去散步前，我小心地把钢笔放进了口袋。我记得很清楚。那时我看了看钟。那时是十点二十分。然而，我回去的时候，钢笔却在桌子上。有人用过它。墨水所剩无几。我希望他没写那么多东西。这实在是让人心绪不定。","And yet, explain one thing.To-day, before going for my walk, I carefully put the fountain pen in my pocket before leaving the room.I remember it distinctly.I looked at the clock at the time.It was twenty minutes past ten.Yet on my return there was the pen lying on the desk.Some one had been using it.There was very little ink left.I wish he would not write so much.It is disconcerting."
"有一件事我和吉姆看法不一致。他相信事物的形体是永恒的。因此，他很快就接受了由此推出的不灭论和其他玄学派哲学家的观点。我对他这点很不能忍受。我曾费心地追查过他信仰形体不灭论的发展过程，展示给他看这种信仰是怎样从他早期对逻辑和数学的迷恋中衍生出来的。从那种歪曲的、偏离正确方向、又抽象的观点来看，当然很容易就会相信形体不灭。","There was one thing upon which Jim and I were not quite agreed.He believed in the eternity of the forms of things.Therefore, entered in immediately the consequent belief in immortality, and all the other notions of the metaphysical philosophers.I had little patience with him in this.Painstakingly I have traced to him the evolution of his belief in the eternity of forms, showing him how it has arisen out of his early infatuation with logic and mathematics.Of course, from that warped, squinting, abstract view-point, it is very easy to believe in the eternity of forms."
"我嘲笑看不到的世界。我的看法是，只有客观存在的才是真实的，不可感知的就不存在，不可能存在。我相信宇宙是机械的。化学和物理足以解释一切。“有不存在的东西吗？”他反问我。我说他的问题只不过是基督教科学派三段论谬误的主题。噢，相信我，我也清楚自己的逻辑。但是他太顽固。我对哲学的唯心主义者从来就没什么耐心。","I laughed at the unseen world.Only the real was real, I contended, and what one did not perceive, was not, could not be.I believed in a mechanical universe.Chemistry and physics explained everything.“Can no being be?” he demanded in reply.I said that his question was but the major promise of a fallacious Christian Science syllogism.Oh, believe me, I know my logic, too.But he was very stubborn.I never had any patience with philosophic idealists."
"有一次我向他声明了我的信仰。我的信仰简明扼要，不可辩驳。　即使是现在我把它写下来，我也知道那是不可辩驳的。就是这样。我对他说：“我以霍布斯的理论断言，思想与可以思想的物质不可分离。我以培根的理论断言，人类的所有认知都来自于感官世界。我以洛克的理论断言，人类的所有思想都是因为感官的功能。我以康德的理论断言，宇宙的机械起源及其产生是一个自然、历史的过程。我以拉普拉斯的观点断言，假定造物主的存在是没有必要的。最后我断言，由以上观点可以得知，形体是短暂的。形体会消失。因此我们会消失。”","Once, I made to him my confession of faith.It was simple, brief, unanswerable.Even as I write it now I know that it is unanswerable.Here it is.I told him: “I assert, with Hobbes, that it is impossible to separate thought from matter that thinks.I assert, with Bacon, that all human understanding arises from the world of sensations.I assert, with Locke, that all human ideas are due to the functions of the senses.I assert, with Kant, the mechanical origin of the universe, and that creation is a natural and historical process.I assert, with Laplace, that there is no need of the hypothesis of a creator.And, finally, I assert, because of all the foregoing, that form is ephemeral.Form passes.Therefore we pass.”"
"我再说一遍，那是不可辩驳的。然而他用佩利那臭名昭著的钟表理论来反驳我。他还提到镭，就差列举出所有近年来实验研究中发现的物质的存在了。太孩子气了。我做梦也没想到他会如此幼稚。","I repeat, it was unanswerable.Yet did he answer with Paley’s notorious fallacy of the watch.Also, he talked about radium, and all but asserted that the very existence of matter had been exploded by these later-day laboratory researches.It was childish.I had not dreamed he could be so immature."
"谁能跟这样的人争论下去？我随后宣称了所有理由的合理之处。这点他同意了，却保留了一个例外。他看着我，用我绝不可能误解的方式说出来。这个推论不言而喻。我很震惊在这么严肃的讨论之中，他居然会为这么低俗的一句俏皮话负疚。","How could one argue with such a man?I then asserted the reasonableness of all that is.To this he agreed, reserving, however, one exception.He looked at me, as he said it, in a way I could not mistake.The inference was obvious.That he should be guilty of so cheap a quip in the midst of a serious discussion, astounded me."
"形体不灭。太荒谬了。然而这句话却有着奇怪的魔力。如果真是这样，他消失了吗？他存在过吗？这是不可能的。","The eternity of forms.It is ridiculous.Yet is there a strange magic in the words.If it be true, then has he not ceased to exist.Then does he exist.This is impossible."
"我停止了锻炼。只要呆在房间里，我就不会被幻觉打扰。但是只要我离开一会儿再回来，他就会在那里，坐在桌旁写东西。然而我不敢向精神医生吐露心事。我一定要自己克服它。","I have ceased exercising.As long as I remain in the room, the hallucination does not bother me.But when I return to the room after an absence, he is always there, sitting at the desk, writing.Yet I dare not confide in a physician.I must fight this out by myself."
"他变本加厉地纠缠我。今天我在书架上查了本书，转身就发现他又坐在椅子上。这是他第一次敢在我在场的时候这样做。然而，我死死地、严厉地盯住他几分钟，就迫使他消失了。这证明了我的主张。他不存在。如果他的形体是永恒的，我就不可能仅凭自己的意志力使他消失。","He grows more importunate.To-day, consulting a book on the shelf, I turned and found him again in the chair.This is the first time he has dared do this in my presence.Nevertheless, by looking at him steadily and sternly for several minutes, I compelled him to vanish.This proves my contention.He does not exist.If he were an eternal form I could not make him vanish by a mere effort of my will."
"情况越来越糟。今天我盯了他整整一个小时，才能使他离开。然而那是如此简单。我看到的只是回忆的画面。二十年来我已经习惯于看到他坐在桌旁。眼前的现象只是记忆画面的再现——印在我意识里无数次的画面。","This is getting damnable.To-day I gazed at him for an entire hour before I could make him leave.Yet it is so simple.What I see is a memory picture.For twenty years I was accustomed to seeing him there at the desk.The present phenomenon is merely a recrudescence of that memory picture—a picture which was impressed countless times on my consciousness."
"今天我放弃了。我被他弄得精疲力尽，他还是不肯离开。我坐在那里，一个小时接一个小时地盯着他。他根本就没注意我，只是一直写下去。我知道他在写什么，因为我越过他的肩头看到过。那不是真的。他占据的优势对我太不公平了。","I gave up to-day.He exhausted me, and still he would not go.I sat and watched him hour after hour.He takes no notice of me, but continually writes.I know what he writes, for I read it over his shoulder.It is not true.He is taking an unfair advantage."
"疑问：他只是我意识的产物，那么意识是不是能够创造实体呢？","Query: He is a product of my consciousness; is it possible, then, that entities may be created by consciousness?"
"我们没有争吵。直到今天我也不清楚一切是怎么发生的。让我告诉你。你就会明白。他生前最后那个令我永生不忘的晚上，我们熬到很晚。还是那个老得不能再老的话题——形体不灭。我们为此花费了多少小时多少夜晚啊！","We did not quarrel.To this day I do not know how it happened.Let me tell you.Then you will see.We sat up late that never-to-be-forgotten last night of his existence.It was the old, old discussion—the eternity of forms.How many hours and how many nights we had consumed over it!"
"这个晚上他特别烦人，我的神经都在尖叫。他坚持人类灵魂自身就是一种存在，不灭的存在，他的思想之光将永生不灭地延续下去。我拿起了拨火棒。","On this night he had been particularly irritating, and all my nerves were screaming.He had been maintaining that the human soul was itself a form, an eternal form, and that the light within his brain would go on forever and always.I took up the poker."
"“假如，”我说，“我用这个把你打死呢？”","“Suppose,” I said, “I should strike you dead with this?”"
"“我会继续存在。”他答道。","“I would go on,” he answered."
"“作为一个有意识的实体？”我问道。","“As a conscious entity?” I demanded."
"“是的，作为一个有意识的实体，”他答道。“我会继续存在，游荡在更高等存在所在的星球之间，记得尘世的生活、你和这场争论。嗯，我将继续和你争论下去。”","“Yes, as a conscious entity,” was his reply.“I should go on, from plane to plane of higher existence, remembering my earth-life, you, this very argument—ay, and continuing the argument with you.”"
"那只是场争论[1]。我发誓那只是争论而已。我从没举起过手。我怎么会呢？他是我的兄弟，我的哥哥，吉姆。","It was only argument [1].I swear it was only argument.I never lifted a hand.How could I?He was my brother, my elder brother, Jim."
"我记不清了。我那时十分恼怒。他总是这样固执于这个形而上学信仰。我记得的下一个场景就是他躺在壁炉边。鲜血横流。太可怕了。他一言不发。一动不动。他一定是晕过去了，撞到了头。我注意到拨火棒上有血。一定是他倒下的时侯头撞到了上面。然而我弄不明白这是怎么发生的，因为我一直把它握在手里。就在我看它的时候还握着它。","I cannot remember.I was very exasperated.He had always been so obstinate in this metaphysical belief of his.The next I knew, he was lying on the hearth.Blood was running.It was terrible.He did not speak.He did not move.He must have fallen in a fit and struck his head.I noticed there was blood on the poker.In falling he must have struck upon it with his head.And yet I fail to see how this can be, for I held it in my hand all the time.I was still holding it in my hand as I looked at it."
"那是幻觉。根据常识可以得出这样的结论。我看着它愈演愈烈。一开始，我只能在最昏暗的光线里看到他坐在椅子上。但是随着时间流逝，幻觉在一遍遍的重现中强化了，他都能在最强烈的光中出现在椅子上。如上就是解释。相当令人满意。","It is an hallucination.That is a conclusion of common sense.I have watched the growth of it.At first it was only in the dimmest light that I could see him sitting in the chair.But as the time passed, and the hallucination, by repetition, strengthened, he was able to appear in the chair under the strongest lights.That is the explanation.It is quite satisfactory."
"我永远都不会忘记我第一次看到它的时候。我独自在楼下吃饭。我从不喝酒，因此发生的一切极为正常。我在夏日的暮光里回到书房。我瞥了一眼桌子。他就在那里，坐着。一切是如此自然，我在没意识到之前就大声喊出“吉姆！”随后我想起了发生的一切。那当然是幻觉。我知道。我提起拨火棒朝它走过去。他没动也没消失。拨火棒劈过这个不存在的物质，打在了椅背上。这都是幻象构造的。拨火棒击打的痕迹现在还留在椅子上。我停止写作，转过身看着它，把指尖压进凹痕之中。","I shall never forget the first time I saw it.I had dined alone downstairs.I never drink wine, so that what happened was eminently normal.It was in the summer twilight that I returned to the study.I glanced at the desk.There he was, sitting.So natural was it, that before I knew I cried out “Jim!”Then I remembered all that had happened.Of course it was an hallucination.I knew that.I took the poker and went over to it.He did not move nor vanish.The poker cleaved through the non-existent substance of the thing and struck the back of the chair.Fabric of fancy, that is all it was.The mark is there on the chair now where the poker struck.I pause from my writing and turn and look at it—press the tips of my fingers into the indentation."
"他的确在继续争论。我今天偷偷地走近，从他肩头看过去。他在记录我们的争论。记录的仍旧是以前形不灭的废话。但是当我接着读下去的时候，他写下了我用拨火棒在他身上进行的实际的试验。这是不公平、虚假的。我没有做什么试验。他是倒下的时候头撞在拨火棒上的。","He did continue the argument.I stole up to-day and looked over his shoulder.He was writing the history of our discussion.It was the same old nonsense about the eternity of forms.But as I continued to read, he wrote down the practical test I had made with the poker.Now this is unfair and untrue.I made no test.In falling he struck his head on the poker."
"有一天，有人会发现并读到他写的东西。那将会很可怕。我怀疑那个仆人，他总是鬼鬼祟祟地想仔细看我写的东西。我得采取点措施。我的每个仆人都很好奇我写了什么。","Some day, somebody will find and read what he writes.This will be terrible.I am suspicious of the servant, who is always peeping and peering, trying to see what I write.I must do something.Every servant I have had is curious about what I write."
"幻想的构造。这就是它的面貌。坐在椅子上的吉姆不存在。我知道的。昨天夜里，当房间里沉寂下来的时候，我下到地窖里，仔细察看烟囱附近的泥土。没有被动过。尸体没有出来。","Fabric of fancy.That is all it is.There is no Jim who sits in the chair.I know that.Last night, when the house was asleep, I went down into the cellar and looked carefully at the soil around the chimney.It was untampered with.The dead do not rise up."
"昨天早上走进书房的时候，他就在椅子上。我把他赶走后，自己在椅子上坐了一整天。我让仆人把饭端到面前。因此几个小时里，我都避过看到他的情景，因为他在椅子上出现。我很累，但是我坐到很晚，直到十一点。然而，当我站起来去睡觉的时候环顾四周，他又出现在那里。他立刻就溜到了椅子上。只是幻想的织造，他整天都盘踞在我的脑子里。一旦椅子空出来，他就占据在椅子上。这些就是他所吹嘘的高等存在所在的星球吗——他弟弟的脑子和一把椅子？然而，他错了吗？他永恒的形体弱化到只是个幻影了吗？幻影是真实存在的实体吗？为什么不？有精神食粮。总有一天我会自己得出问题的结论。","Yesterday morning, when I entered the study, there he was in the chair.When I had dispelled him, I sat in the chair myself all day.I had my meals brought to me.And thus I escaped the sight of him for many hours, for he appears only in the chair.I was weary, but I sat late, until eleven o’clock.Yet, when I stood up to go to bed, I looked around, and there he was.He had slipped into the chair on the instant.Being only fabric of fancy, all day he had resided in my brain.The moment it was unoccupied, he took up his residence in the chair.Are these his boasted higher planes of existence—his brother’s brain and a chair?After all, was he not right?Has his eternal form become so attenuated as to be an hallucination?Are hallucinations real entities?Why not?There is food for thought here.Some day I shall come to a conclusion upon it."
"他今天很烦躁不安。他没法写东西，因为我让仆人把笔装进口袋带出了房间，但是我也没法写东西。","He was very much disturbed to-day.He could not write, for I had made the servant carry the pen out of the room in his pocket But neither could I write."
"仆人从未看到过他。很奇怪。我的目光越发敏锐，能看到别人看不见的东西了吗？更确切地说，这不能证明幽灵是这样的吗——难道是我自己病态意识的产物？","The servant never sees him.This is strange.Have I developed a keener sight for the unseen?Or rather does it not prove the phantom to be what it is—a product of my own morbid consciousness?"
"他又偷走了我的笔。幻觉是不可能偷笔的。这是不可辩驳的。然而我不能总把笔放在房间外面。我自己也要写字。","He has stolen my pen again.Hallucinations cannot steal pens.This is unanswerable.And yet I cannot keep the pen always out of the room.I want to write myself."
"自从我碰上这个麻烦事，已经换了三个仆人，没有一个看到过他。他们的感觉判断是对的吗？还是我的感觉错了？不管怎么说，墨水用得太快了。我更加频繁地灌墨水。而且，只有今天我发现笔的位置不对了。我没有动过它。","I have had three different servants since my trouble came upon me, and not one has seen him.Is the verdict of their senses right?And is that of mine wrong?Nevertheless, the ink goes too rapidly.I fill my pen more often than is necessary.And furthermore, only to-day I found my pen out of order.I did not break it."
"我对他说过很多次话，但他从不搭腔。我坐着看了他一个早上。他老是看着我，很明显他认得我。","I have spoken to him many times, but he never answers.I sat and watched him all morning.Frequently he looked at me, and it was patent that he knew me."
"我用掌根狠狠地击打我的脑侧，这样就能把他的幻象抖出我的视线。然后我就可以坐到椅子上，但是我已经知道要动作迅速才能成功。他经常愚弄我，在我还没能坐下的时候再度出现。","By striking the side of my head violently with the heel of my hand, I can shake the vision of him out of my eyes.Then I can get into the chair; but I have learned that I must move very quickly in order to accomplish this.Often he fools me and is back again before I can sit down."
"事情越来越无法忍受了。他像玩偶盒弹出的小人一样突然出现在椅子上。他不是慢慢呈现外形的。他一下子冒出来。这是描述那情景的唯一方式。我无法忍受再看到他。这样让我发疯，因为它几乎要逼我相信，我知道的事实并不是真的。另外，幻觉不会一下子冒出来。","It is getting unbearable.He is a jack-in-the-box the way he pops into the chair.He does not assume form slowly.He pops.That is the only way to describe it.I cannot stand looking at him much more.That way lies madness, for it compels me almost to believe in the reality of what I know is not.Besides, hallucinations do not pop."
"谢天谢地他只出现在椅子上。只要我占据了椅子，就能摆脱他。","Thank God he only manifests himself in the chair.As long as I occupy the chair I am quit of him."
"我那敲头把他逐出椅子的方法正在失效。我不得不更用力地敲打，数十次才可能成功一次。我头上被不断敲击的地方很痛。我得换只手了。","My device for dislodging him from the chair by striking my head, is failing.I have to hit much more violently, and I do not succeed perhaps more than once in a dozen trials.My head is quite sore where I have so repeatedly struck it.I must use the other hand."
"我哥哥是对的。看不到的世界是存在的。我没有看到吗？我不是一直受着看到它的苦吗？叫它想象，想法，随便你叫它什么，它都在那里。这是无法逃避的。思想就是实体。我们用每一个想法来创造。我创造出了这个坐在我的椅子上，用我的墨水的幽灵。他是我创造的，并不意味他不真实。他是一个想法，一个实体。因此，想法即实体，而实体就是真实存在。","My brother was right.There is an unseen world.Do I not see it?Am I not cursed with the seeing of it all the time?Call it a thought, an idea, anything you will, still it is there.It is unescapable.Thoughts are entities.We create with every act of thinking.I have created this phantom that sits in my chair and uses my ink.Because I have created him is no reason that he is any the less real.He is an idea; he is an entity: ergo, ideas are entities, and an entity is a reality."
"疑问：如果一个人，带着他经历过的一切，能够创造出实体，真实的事物，那关于造物主的假说不就被证实了吗？如果有生命的物质能创造，那么假设存在一个能造出有生命物质的人也是合理的。只是程度不同而已。我还没造出一座山或是太阳系，但是我造出了坐在我椅子上的东西。如果是这样，是不是有一天我就能造出山或者太阳系呢？","Query: If a man, with the whole historical process behind him, can create an entity, a real thing, then is not the hypothesis of a Creator made substantial?If the stuff of life can create, then it is fair to assume that there can be a He who created the stuff of life.It is merely a difference of degree.I have not yet made a mountain nor a solar system, but I have made a something that sits in my chair.This being so, may I not some day be able to make a mountain or a solar system?"
"整个人类史，直至今日，人类都活在一个迷宫之中。没人看到过光。我相信自己将看到光了——不是像我哥哥那样偶然发现才看到的，而是有意地、理智地看到。我哥哥死了。他的生命停止了。这点毫无疑问，因为我又去地窖查看过一次。地面没有被动过。我挖开土来确认，我看到了能让我确定的东西。我哥哥不在了，而我又造出了他。这不是我哥哥，而是我能造出的与我哥哥最相近的东西。我跟别人不一样。我是个神。我创造过。","All his days, down to to-day, man has lived in a maze.He has never seen the light.I am convinced that I am beginning to see the light—not as my brother saw it, by stumbling upon it accidentally, but deliberately and rationally.My brother is dead.He has ceased.There is no doubt about it, for I have made another journey down into the cellar to see.The ground was untouched.I broke it myself to make sure, and I saw what made me sure.My brother has ceased, yet have I recreated him.This is not my old brother, yet it is something as nearly resembling him as I could fashion it.I am unlike other men.I am a god.I have created."
"无论我何时离开房间去睡觉，我回过头，总能看到哥哥坐在椅子上。然后，我就因为想到他要坐着熬过漫漫长夜而无法入睡。早上，我一推开书房的门，他就在那里，我知道他在那坐了一夜。","Whenever I leave the room to go to bed, I look back, and there is my brother sitting in the chair.And then I cannot sleep because of thinking of him sitting through all the long night-hours.And in the morning, when I open the study door, there he is, and I know he has sat there the night long."
"睡眠不足使我变得绝望。我希望能向一个精神医生吐露心事。","I am becoming desperate from lack of sleep.I wish I could confide in a physician."
"上帝保佑我睡着！我最终熬过去了。听我说。昨夜我太累了，坐在椅子上打盹。我摇铃叫来仆人，让他把毯子拿给我。我睡着了。这一整夜，他被逐出了我的椅子，他也就被逐出了我的思想。我要整天保持这种状态。那是个美好的解脱。","Blessed sleep!I have won to it at last.Let me tell you.Last night I was so worn that I found myself dozing in my chair.I rang for the servant and ordered him to bring blankets.I slept.All night was he banished from my thoughts as he was banished from my chair.I shall remain in it all day.It is a wonderful relief."
"在椅子上睡觉并不舒服。但是想着他坐在寒冷的夜里，我一小时又一小时地躺在床上却难以入眠，这滋味更痛苦。","It is uncomfortable to sleep in a chair.But it is more uncomfortable to lie in bed, hour after hour, and not sleep, and to know that he is sitting there in the cold darkness."
"没用的。我将永远都不能再睡在床上了。我现在就试过了，试过无数次，每个这样的夜晚都让我恐惧。要是我能说服他去睡觉就好了！但是我不能。他坐在那里，就坐在那里——我知道他在那里——当我抬头凝视黑暗，想来想去，总是想着他就坐在那里。我希望自己从没听说过形体不灭的说法。","It is no use.I shall never be able to sleep in a bed again.I have tried it now, numerous times, and every such night is a horror.If I could but only persuade him to go to bed!But no.He sits there, and sits there—I know he does—while I stare and stare up into the blackness and think and think, continually think, of him sitting there.I wish I had never heard of the eternity of forms."
"仆人们认为我疯了。那只是将来的预测，因此我从来不请精神医生。","The servants think I am crazy.That is but to be expected, and it is why I have never called in a physician."
"我下定决心了。从今往后幻觉就会停止。从现在起我就呆在椅子上。我永远都不会离开它。我会日日夜夜永远呆在椅子上。","I am resolved.Henceforth this hallucination ceases.From now on I shall remain in the chair.I shall never leave it.I shall remain in it night and day and always."
"我成功了。我已经有两周没看到他了。我再也不会看到他了。我终于得到了哲学思考所必需的镇定。今天我写了整整一章。","I have succeeded.For two weeks I have not seen him.Nor shall I ever see him again.I have at last attained the equanimity of mind necessary for philosophic thought.I wrote a complete chapter to-day."
"坐在椅子上很累。周复一周地过去了，月份轮回，季节交替，仆人相互轮换，而我一直是老样子。只有我还是老样子。我过着奇怪的生活，但是最起码我很平静。","It is very wearisome, sitting in a chair.The weeks pass, the months come and go, the seasons change, the servants replace each other, while I remain.I only remain.It is a strange life I lead, but at least I am at peace."
"他再没出现。形体并不永恒。我证明了这一点。到现在快两年了，我一直呆在这张椅子上，再也没见过他。真的，我的确严格地试过一次。但是我很清楚，我认为自己看到的东西只是幻觉。他从未存在。但我没有离开椅子。我害怕离开椅子。","He comes no more.There is no eternity of forms.I have proved it.For nearly two years now, I have remained in this chair, and I have not seen him once.True, I was severely tried for a time.But it is clear that what I thought I saw was merely hallucination.He never was.Yet I do not leave the chair.I am afraid to leave the chair."
