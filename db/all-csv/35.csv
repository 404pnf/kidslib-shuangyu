"第一章","Chapter I"
"我们搬了新家，我决定写日记。零售商有点烦人，刮泥板也惹出了不少麻烦。牧师光临，让我倍感荣幸。","WE SETTLE DOWN IN OUR NEW HOME, AND I RESOLVE TO KEEP A DIARY. TRADESMEN TROUBLE US A BIT, SO DOES THE SCRAPER. THE CURATE CALLS AND PAYS ME A GREAT COMPLIMENT. "
"我和亲爱的妻子卡丽搬进新家刚好一周了，新家名为“月桂园”，位于霍洛韦区布里克菲尔德街——是个舒适的六居室，不包括地下室在内，还有一个前厅，可以在那儿吃早饭。住所前有一个小花园，小花园内有一段十级台阶直通前门。顺便说一下，我们用铁链将前门锁上了。卡明斯、高英以及其他一些好朋友总从旁侧的小门进来，这样省得佣人放下手头的工作，前去给他们开门。我们还有一个漂亮小巧的后花园，直通火车道旁。一开始我和妻子很担心火车声嘈杂，但房东说我们过一阵子习惯了就察觉不到了，还少收了两英镑的房租。房东确实说得对，除了花园围墙底部有裂缝之外，我们倒没有感到其他不便之处。","My dear wife Carrie and I have just been a week in our new house, “The Laurels,” Brickfield Terrace, Holloway—a nice six-roomed residence, not counting basement with a front breakfast-parlour. We have a little front garden; and there is a flight of ten steps up to the front door which, by-the-by, we keep locked with the chain up. Cummings, Gowing, and our other intimate friends always come to the little side entrance, which saves the servant the trouble of going up to the front door, thereby taking her from her work. We have a nice little back garden which runs down to the railway. We were rather afraid of the noise of the trains at first, but the landlord said we should not notice them after a bit, and took ￡2 off the rent. He was certainly right; and beyond the cracking of the garden-wall at the bottom, we have suffered no inconvenience. "
"从市里下班后，我喜欢呆在家里。要是总不在家，家还有什么用呢？“家，甜蜜的家”，这是我的座右铭。晚上，我总在家呆着，老朋友高英可能会顺便来坐坐，不拘礼节；卡明斯也是这样，他住在马路对面。如果朋友们愿意来串门，我和亲爱的妻子卡罗琳都非常乐意见他们。他们要不来，我和卡丽一起也能打发掉晚上的时间。我们总有事干：这儿钉个钉子，那儿整整百叶窗，墙上钉把扇子，钉钉翘起来的地毯——我可以嘴里含着烟斗，边抽烟边干这些事；而卡丽无外乎是钉钉衬衫扣子、补补枕套，要不就用我们新买的竖式小钢琴练习弹奏《西尔维娅加沃特舞曲》。这架竖式小钢琴是三年分期付款买的，上面标示：坷拉德兄弟公司（字体硕大）W. 比尔科森（字体稍小）生产。还有一件让我们倍感欣慰的事是知道儿子威利在奥尔德姆银行一切顺利。我们就是想多见见他。下面是我的日记：","After my work in the City, I like to be at home. What’s the good of a home, if you are never in it? “Home, Sweet Home,” that’s my motto. I am always in of an evening. Our old friend Gowing may drop in without ceremony; so may Cummings, who lives opposite. My dear wife Caroline1 and I are pleased to see them, if they like to drop in on us. But Carrie and I can manage to pass our evenings together without friends. There is always something to be done: a tin-tack here, a Venetian blind to put straight, a fan to nail up, or part of a carpet to nail down—all of which I can do with my pipe in my mouth; while Carrie is not above putting a button on a shirt, mending a pillowcase, or practising the “Sylvia Gavotte” on our new cottage piano (on the three years’ system), manufactured by W. Bilkson (in small letters), from Collard and Collard (in very large letters). It is also a great comfort to us to know that our boy Willie is getting on so well in the Bank at Oldham. We should like to see more of him. Now for my diary: "
"40271.0零售商们上门来揽活，我答应五金商法默森，若需要钉子、工具一类的就去找他。顺便说一下，这倒提醒我了，卧室门没有钥匙，有几处的门铃也得修了。前厅的门铃坏了，还有按前门门铃，响的却是佣人屋里的铃，真是可笑。亲爱的朋友高英来串门，却不肯久留，说有股该死的油漆味。","April 3.Tradesmen called for custom, and I promised Farmerson, the ironmonger, to give him a turn if I wanted any nails or tools. By-the-by, that reminds me there is no key to our bedroom door, and the bells must be seen to. The parlour bell is broken, and the front door rings up in the servant’s bedroom, which is ridiculous. Dear friend Gowing dropped in, but wouldn’t stay, saying there was an infernal smell of paint. "
"40272.0零售商们依旧上门来揽活：卡丽出去了，我打算与浩文成交，他看起来是个有教养的肉商，肉铺干净整洁。我在他那儿定了一块羊胛，准备明天吃，试试看他那儿的东西好不好。卡丽约了黄油商鲍塞特，在他那儿定了一磅新鲜黄油、一磅半盐之类的厨房调味品，还有一先令的鸡蛋。晚上，卡明斯意外造访，让我看他在市里抽彩得来的海泡石烟斗，还告诉我触摸要小心，手潮的话会破坏它的色泽。他说不在我家呆了，不太受得了这油漆味。他出门时，被刮泥板绊倒了。必须把这刮泥板卸了，要不哪天把我给刮了。我不怎么开玩笑。","April 4.Tradesmen still calling: Carrie being out, I arranged to deal with Horwin, who seemed a civil butcher with a nice clean shop. Ordered a shoulder of mutton for to-morrow,  to give him a trial. Carrie arranged with Borset, the butterman, and ordered a pound of fresh butter, and a pound and a half of salt ditto for kitchen, and a shilling’s worth of eggs. In the evening, Cummings unexpectedly dropped in to show me a meerschaum pipe he had won in a raffle in the City, and told me to handle it carefully, as it would spoil the colouring if the hand was moist. He said he wouldn’t stay, as he didn’t care much for the smell of the paint, and fell over the scraper as he went out. Must get the scraper removed, or else I shall get into a scrape. I don’t often make jokes. "
"40273.0结果送来了两块羊胛，是卡丽跟另一个肉商订的，之前她没跟我商量。高英来串门，进门时让刮泥板绊了一跤。必须得把刮泥板卸了。","April 5.Two shoulders of mutton arrived, Carrie having arranged with another butcher without consulting me. Gowing called, and fell over scraper coming in. Must get that scraper removed. "
"40274.0早餐的鸡蛋真是糟透了，我把剩下的鸡蛋退给了鲍塞特，“表扬”了他几句，还说他不必再来找我们订货了。我找不到伞，外面瓢泼大雨，却也不得不冒雨出去。萨拉说肯定是昨晚高英先生拿错了，因为门厅里有根手杖，不知道是谁的。晚上，我听到有人在楼下门厅里跟佣人大声嚷嚷，就出去看看是谁，发现是鲍塞特那个黄油商，我很惊讶，他喝醉了，还蛮横无理。鲍塞特一看到我，就说他以后要是再为市里的职员服务，就宁愿被绞死，因为这太不值当了。我控制了一下情绪，平静地说，我觉得市里的职员也有可能是体面人。他回答说他听到这话很高兴，想知道我有没有遇到过这样的体面人，因为他从来没遇到过。他摔门而去，差点把门上的扇形窗摔坏了；紧接着，我听到他被刮泥板绊倒的动静，这让我窃喜，幸亏没把它卸掉。他走了以后，我才想到一个绝妙的回答，本来可以回敬他的。算了，留着下次用吧。","April 6. Eggs for breakfast simply shocking; sent them back to Borset with my compliments, and he needn’t call any more for orders. Couldn’t find umbrella, and though it was pouring with rain, had to go without it. Sarah said Mr. Gowing must have took it by mistake last night, as there was a stick in the ’all that didn’t belong to nobody. In the evening, hearing someone talking in a loud voice to the servant in the downstairs hall, I went out to see who it was, and was surprised to find it was Borset, the butterman, who was both drunk and offensive. Borset, on seeing me, said he would be hanged if he would ever serve City clerks any more—the game wasn’t worth the candle I restrained my feelings, and quietly remarked that I thought it was possible for a City clerk to be a gentleman. He replied he was very glad to hear it, and wanted to know whether I had ever come across one, for he hadn’t. He left the house, slamming the door after him, which nearly broke the fanlight; and I heard him fall over the scraper, which made me feel glad I hadn’t removed it. When he had gone, I thought of a splendid answer I ought to have given him. However, I will keep it for another occasion."
"40275.0今天是星期六，盼着早点下班回家，把几件事办妥；可公司两个负责人生病请假了，所以七点我才回到家。到家发现鲍塞特一直在等我，今天他已经来过三次了，想为昨晚的行为道歉。他说上周一的银行假日没能休成，昨晚才休。他请求我接受他的道歉，还有一磅新鲜黄油。毕竟这家伙像个正经人；所以我跟他预订了一些新鲜鸡蛋，并要求这一次必须新鲜。我觉得我们还是得买些新的楼梯地毯了，旧地毯不够宽，遮不住楼梯两边没上油漆的地方。卡丽提议，我们自己可以加宽油漆带。我看看周一能不能找到匹配的颜色（黑巧克力色）。","April 7.Being Saturday, I looked forward to being home early, and putting a few things straight; but two of our principals at the office were absent through illness, and I did not get home till seven. Found Borset waiting. He had been three times during the day to apologise for his conduct last night. He said he was unable to take his Bank Holiday2 last Monday, and took it last night instead. He begged me to accept his apology, and a pound of fresh butter. He seems, after all, a decent sort of fellow; so I gave him an order for some fresh eggs, with a request that on this occasion they should be fresh. I am afraid we shall have to get some new stair-carpets after all; our old ones are not quite wide enough to meet the paint on either side. Carrie suggests that we might ourselves broaden the paint. I will see if we can match the colour (dark chocolate) on Monday. "
"4月8日 礼拜日做完礼拜后，牧师跟我们一起回到家。我让卡丽先进屋去开前门，这扇门我们都不用，除非在特殊场合。卡丽打不开门，我使尽浑身解数也还是不行，只得带牧师（顺便说一句，我不记得他的名字了）绕到侧门。他的脚让刮泥板绊了一下，裤脚被撕烂了。最让人恼火的是，卡丽在礼拜日提出给他缝补裤子也不太合适。吃完饭就睡觉了。睡觉起来去花园转了一圈，发现一块不错的地方，适合种芥菜苗和小萝卜。晚上又去了教堂，还是跟牧师一起走回来的。卡丽注意到他穿着先前穿的那条裤子，只是已经补过了。牧师让我端着募捐的盘子，我倍感荣幸。","April 8, Sunday.After Church, the Curate came back with us. I sent Carrie in to open front door, which we do not use except on special occasions. She could not get it open, and after all my display, I had to take the Curate (whose name, by-the-by, I did not catch) round the side entrance. He caught his foot in the scraper, and tore the bottom of his trousers. Most annoying, as Carrie could not well offer to repair them on a Sunday. After dinner, went to sleep. Took a walk round the garden, and discovered a beautiful spot for sowing mustard-and-cress and radishes. Went to Church again in the evening: walked back with the Curate. Carrie noticed he had got on the same pair of trousers, only repaired. He wants me to take round the plate, which I think a great compliment. "

"第三章","Chapter III"
"跟默顿先生聊了聊社交。萨顿的詹姆斯夫妇来我家。在坦克剧场的一晚，痛苦万分。试着用了用瓷漆。我又开了一个有趣的玩笑，但把高英和卡明斯惹恼了，其实他俩没必要生气。我把浴缸涂成了红色，可万万没料到后果。","A CONVERSATION WITH MR. MERTON ON SOCIETY. MR. ANDMRS. JAMES, OF SUTTON, COME UP. A MISERABLE EVENINGAT THE TANK THEATRE. EXPERIMENTS WITH ENAMELPAINT. I MAKE ANOTHER GOOD JOKE; BUT GOWING ANDCUMMINGS ARE UNNECESSARILY OFFENDED. I PAINT THEBATH RED, WITH UNEXPECTED RESULT."
"4 月19 日卡明斯来串门，带着他的朋友默顿，是做酒生意的。高英也来串门了。默顿很快就把这里当自己家了，我和卡丽马上被他的这种情绪感染了，完全赞成他的态度。","April 19.Cummings called, bringing with him his friend Merton, who is in the wine trade. Gowing also called. Mr. Merton made himself at home at once, and Carrie and I were both struck with him immediately, and thoroughly approved of his sentiments."
"他靠在椅子上说：“你们千万别挑剔我。”我回答说：“不会的，你也别挑我们。我们就是普通老百姓，不是什么了不起的人物。”","He leaned back in his chair and said: “You must take me as I am;” and I replied: “Yes—and you must take us as we are. We’re homely people, we are not swells.”"
"他回答道：“嗯，我能看出来。”高英哈哈大笑；但默顿非常有礼貌地对高英说：“我觉得你不大明白我的意思，我是想说我们可爱的男主人和女主人比那些赶时髦的蠢家伙们强多了。他们喜欢过简朴、健康的生活，而不喜欢四处闲逛去喝两便士半的下午茶，过入不敷出的生活。","He answered: “No, I can see that,” and Gowing roared with laughter; but Merton in a most gentlemanly manner said to Gowing, “I don’t think you quite understand me. I intended to convey that our charming host and hostess were superior to the follies of fashion, and preferred leading a simple and wholesome life to gadding about to twopenny-halfpenny tea-drinking afternoons, and living above their incomes.”"
"默顿这番明智的评论让我感到非常高兴。就此话题，我总结道：“是的，坦白讲，默顿先生，我们不参加社交活动，是因为我们不喜欢，而且考虑到去这去那的出租马车费，还要戴白手套，扎白领带等等，不值得花那钱。”","I was immensely pleased with these sensible remarks of Merton’s, and concluded that subject by saying: “No, candidly, Mr. Merton, we don’t go into Society, because we do not care for it; and what with the expense of cabs here and cabs there, and white gloves and white ties, etc., it doesn’t seem worth the money.”"
"谈到朋友，默顿先生说：“我的座右铭是‘少且真’；顺便说一句，我还把它运用到喝酒中，‘少且精’。”高英说：“是的，有时候就是‘价廉味美’，是吧，老伙计？”默顿接着说，他会把我当朋友，记下我的名字，给我留12 瓶他的“罗肯巴”威士忌。因为我是高英的老朋友，所以卖给我是36 先令一瓶，这比进价还要低很多。","Merton said in reference to friends, “My motto is ‘Few and True’; and, by the way, I also apply that to wine, ‘Little and Good.’” Gowing said: “Yes, and sometimes ‘cheap and tasty,’ eh, old man?” Merton still continuing, said he should treat me as a friend, and put me down for a dozen of his “Lockanbar” whisky, and as I was an old friend of Gowing, I should have it for 36s., which was considerably under what he paid for it."
"他写下自己的订单，又说我什么时候想要剧院的票就跟他说，因为他的名字在伦敦任何一家剧院都好使。","He booked his own order, and further said that at any time I wanted any passes for the theatre I was to let him know, as his name stood good for any theatre in London."
"卡丽提醒我说，她的老同学、老朋友安妮. 福勒斯（现在是詹姆斯太太）和丈夫要从萨顿来我们这里呆几天，要是带他们去剧院看看戏，会显得我们友好，看我能不能写封短信给默顿，向他要四张票，意大利歌剧院、干草垛剧院、萨瓦戏院或莱森戏院，哪家都行。我给默顿写信大致讲了这个意思。","April 20.Carrie reminded me that as her old school friend, Annie Fullers(now Mrs. James), and her husband had come up from Sutton for a few days, it would look kind to take them to the theatre, and would I drop a line to Mr. Merton asking him for passes for four, either for the Italian Opera, Haymarket, Savoy, or Lyceum. I wrote Merton to that effect."
"4 月21 日收到默顿的回信，说他很忙，正好当下弄不到意大利歌剧院、干草垛剧院、萨瓦戏院或莱森戏院的票，但伦敦时下最好的戏莫过于伊斯灵顿坦克剧院上演的《棕色灌木丛》。他随信寄来四张票，还有威士忌账单。","April 21.Got a reply from Merton, saying he was very busy, and just at present couldn’t manage passes for the Italian Opera, Haymarket, Savoy, or Lyceum, but the best thing going on in London was the Brown Bushes, at the Tank Theatre, Islington, and enclosed seats for four; also bill for whisky."
"4 月23 日詹姆斯先生和太太（也就是福勒斯小姐）来我们家用了午后茶点，然后我们直接前往坦克剧院。我们乘公共马车到了国王十字路口，然后转车去“安吉尔”。詹姆斯先生每次都坚持要为大家付车钱，说我已经付了戏票钱，够破费了。","April 23.Mr. and Mrs. James (Miss Fullers that was), came to meat tea, and we left directly after for the Tank Theatre. We got a ’bus that took us to King’s Cross, and then changed into one that took us to the “Angel.” Mr. James each time insisted on paying for all, saying that I had paid for the tickets and that was quite enough."
"我们到了剧院，奇怪得很，除了一位挎篮子的老太太，我们车上其他人似乎都要进去。我走在前面，递过戏票，那个人看了看，举起我们的票大声喊道：“威鲁利先生，你知道这是怎么回事吗？”那位被招呼的先生走过来，仔细看了我们的票，说道：“这些戏票谁给你们的？”我非常生气，回答道：“当然是默顿先生。”他说：“默顿？默顿是谁？”我厉声答道：“你应该知道吧，他的名字在伦敦任何一家剧院都好使。”他回答说：“哦！是吗？可是在这里不好使。这些票没有印日期，是斯温斯特迪先生经营剧院的时候发出去的，后来剧院就易主了。”就在我跟这个人闹得不愉快的时候，已经跟女士们上了楼的詹姆斯喊道：“快上来吧！”我随他们上去，一个非常有礼貌的服务员说：“这边请，H 包厢。”我对詹姆斯说：“这是怎么回事？你究竟怎么处理的？”他的回答让我很不舒服：“怎么回事，当然是付钱了。”","We arrived at theatre, where, curiously enough, all our ’bus-load except an old woman with a basket seemed to be going in. I walked ahead and presented the tickets. The man looked at them, and called out “Mr. Willowly! do you know anything about these?” holding up my tickets. The gentleman called to, came up and examined my tickets, and said: “Who gave you these?” I said, rather indignantly: “Mr. Merton, of course.” He said: “Merton? Who’s he?” I answered rather sharply, “You ought to know, his name’s good at any theatre in London.” He replied: “Oh! is it? Well, it ain’t no good here. These tickets which are not dated, were issued under Mr. Swinstead’s management, which has since changed hands.” While I was having some very unpleasant words with the man, James, who had gone upstairs with the ladies, called out: “Come on!” I went up after them, and a very civil attendant said: “This way, please, box H.” I said to James: “Why, how on earth did you manage it?” and to my horror he replied: “Why, paid for it of course.”"
"这太丢人了，我几乎看不进去戏，不过我注定了还要丢人。我正从包厢探出身去，我的领结——一个小的黑蝴蝶结，用一种新的专利方法别在纽扣上——掉到了下面正厅后排的观众席上，一个笨手笨脚的家伙没注意就踩在了上面，好久才发现。然后他捡起来，最后厌恶地扔在了旁边的座位下面。想着包厢和领带的事，我感到非常难受。萨顿的詹姆斯先生可真好，他说：“别担心，你留着胡子，没人会注意到你没戴领带，我觉得这是留胡子的唯一好处了。”这话说得真不合时宜，因为卡丽非常得意我的胡子。","This was humiliating enough, and I could scarcely follow the play, but I was doomed to still further humiliation. I was leaning out of the box, when my tie—a little black bow which fastened on to the stud by means of a new patent—fell into the pit below. A clumsy man not noticing it, had his foot on it for ever so long before he discovered it. He then picked it up and eventually flung it under the next seat in disgust. What with the box incident and the tie, I felt quite miserable. Mr. James, of Sutton, was very good. He said: “Don’t worry—no one will notice it with your beard. That is the only advantage of growing one that I can see.” There was no occasion for that remark, for Carrie is very proud of my beard."
"为了掩饰领结掉了，那晚余下的时间里，我都低着下巴，这搞得我后颈酸疼。","To hide the absence of the tie I had to keep my chin down the rest of the evening, which caused a pain at the back of my neck."
"4 月24 日昨晚几乎没能合眼，一直在想带着从乡下来的詹姆斯夫妇去看戏的事。想着因为剧院不承认我们的免费入场券有效，竟让詹姆斯先生掏钱要了一个私人包厢，而且戏也差劲。我给默顿写了一封相当讽刺的信，就是那个给我们票的葡萄酒商。我在信中说：“考虑到我们不得不为看戏花了钱，因此我们竭尽全力欣赏了表演。”我觉得这句话非常尖刻，然后我问卡丽“欣赏”这个词有几个“p”, 卡丽说“一个”。我把信寄出去以后查了查字典，发现是两个“p”，真是气死我了。","April 24.Could scarcely sleep a wink through thinking of having brought up Mr. and Mrs. James from the country to go to the theatre last night, and his having paid for a private box because our order was not honoured; and such a poor play too. I wrote a very satirical letter to Merton, the wine merchant, who gave us the pass, and said, “Considering we had to pay for our seats, we did our best to appreciate the performance.” I thought this line rather cutting, and I asked Carrie how many p’s there were in appreciate1, and she said, “One.” After I sent off the letter I looked at the dictionary and found there were two. Awfully vexed at this."
"决定不再让詹姆斯夫妇的事困扰我自己了，因为卡丽聪明地说：“我们下周可以挑个晚上请他们从萨顿来我们这儿玩伯齐克牌，这样不就行啦。”","Decided not to worry myself any more about the James’s; for, as Carrie wisely said, “We’ll make it all right with them by asking them up from Sutton one evening next week, to play at Bézique.”"
"4 月25 日由于布里克威尔告诉我，他妻子正用着新的品克福特瓷漆，效果非常不错，我决定试试看。下班回家的路上，我买了两罐红色的。匆匆忙忙用完茶点，就钻到花园里，油漆了一些花盆。我把卡丽叫出来，她说：“你总有股狂热要搞些新奇玩意儿。”但她不得不承认这些花盆看起来相当不错。我上楼进了佣人的卧室，把她的脸盆架、毛巾架和抽屉柜都漆了一遍。我觉得有惊人的改观，但我们的佣人萨拉真是典型的下等人，没有品位。看到漆过的这些东西，没显出任何高兴的神色，只不过说了句：“我觉得以前的颜色挺好看的。”","April 25.In consequence of Brickwell telling me his wife was working wonders with the new Pinkford’s enamel paint, I determined to try it. I bought two tins of red on my way home. I hastened through tea, went into the garden and painted some flower-pots. I called out Carrie, who said: “You’ve always got some new-fangled craze;” but she was obliged to admit that the flower-pots looked remarkably well. Went upstairs into the servant’s bedroom and painted her washstand, towel-horse, and chest of drawers. To my mind it was an extraordinary improvement, but as an example of the ignorance of the lower classes in the matter of taste, our servant Sarah, on seeing them, evinced no sign of pleasure, but merely said she thought they looked very well as they was before."
"又买了点红色瓷漆（我觉得红色最好看），把煤斗漆了漆，还有我们《莎士比亚全集》的封底，这书的封皮都快散架了。","April 26.Got some more red enamel paint (red, to my mind, being the best colour), and painted the coal-scuttle, and the backs of our Shakespeare, the binding of which had almost worn out."
"把浴缸漆成了红色，效果让我很满意。遗憾的是，卡丽不高兴了，事实上为此我们还拌了几句嘴。她说我本该征求一下她的意见，她从没听说过谁家把浴缸漆成红色。我回答说：“这只是品位问题。”","April 27.Painted the bath red, and was delighted with the result. Sorry to say Carrie was not, in fact we had a few words about it. She said I ought to have consulted her, and she had never heard of such a thing as a bath being painted red. I replied: “It’s merely a matter of taste.”"
"幸亏有说话声打断了我们对此的争吵。“我可以进来吗？”是卡明斯。他说：“你们佣人开的门，说抱歉她不能领我进来，因为她正在拧袜子。”我见到他很高兴，提议玩惠斯特牌，带明手的那种。我开玩笑说：“你可以当傀儡。”卡明斯（我觉得相当不友善地）回答说：“跟往常一样好笑。”他说他不能留下来玩，只是来给我《自行车新闻报》的，因为他已经看完了。","Fortunately, further argument on the subject was stopped by a voice saying, “May I come in?” It was only Cummings, who said, “Your maid opened the door, and asked me to excuse her showing me in, as she was wringing out some socks.” I was delighted to see him, and suggested we should have a game of whist2 with a dummy3, and by way of merriment said: “You can be the dummy4.”Cummings (I thought rather ill-naturedly) replied: “Funny as usual.” He said he couldn’t stop, he only called to leave me the Bicycle News, as he had done with it."
"门铃又响了，是高英，他说他必须道歉，因为来得太勤了，改天要我们一定去他家转转。我说：“我突然想起来一件非常特别的事。”“跟往常一样好笑。”卡明斯说道。“是的，”我回答说，“我觉得这次就连你都会说好笑，而且事关你俩；高英总是来，卡明斯总是去，难道看着不奇怪吗？”卡丽显然把浴缸的事忘得一干二净了，大笑了一阵。至于我，在椅子上几乎笑弯了腰，直到身下的椅子发出吱吱扭扭的声音。我觉得这是我说过的最有趣的玩笑之一。","Another ring at the bell; it was Gowing, who said he “must apologise for coming so often, and that one of these days we must come round to him.” I said: “A very extraordinary thing has struck me.” “Something funny, as usual,” said Cummings. “Yes,” I replied; “I think even you will say so this time. It’s concerning you both; for doesn’t it seem odd that Gowing’s always coming and Cumming’s always going5?” Carrie, who had evidently quite forgotten about the bath, went into fits of laughter, and as for myself, I fairly doubled up in my chair, till it cracked beneath me. I think this was one of the best jokes I have ever made."
"后来看到卡明斯和高英两人都一声不吭，脸上也没有一丝笑容，想象一下当时我的惊讶之情吧。一阵不愉快的沉默后，卡明斯将打开的雪茄盒又合上了，说：“是的，我想，要这样的话，我是该走了，抱歉我没明白你的玩笑哪儿好笑。”高英说只要玩笑开得不粗鲁，他不会介意，但是他觉得在人名上玩双关，当然不怎么有品味。卡明斯紧接着说要是别人这么说，而不是我，他就不会再登这家的门了。今晚本该是个愉快的晚上，就这么扫兴收场了。不过他们走了也好，因为打日工的清洁女佣已经把剩下的冷盘肉吃光了。","Then imagine my astonishment on perceiving both Cummings and Gowing perfectly silent, and without a smile on their faces. After rather an unpleasant pause, Cummings, who had opened a cigar-case, closed it up again and said: “Yes— I think, after that, I shall be going, and I am sorry I fail to see the fun of your jokes.” Gowing said he didn’t mind a joke when it wasn’t rude, but a pun on a name, to his thinking, was certainly a little wanting in good taste. Cummings followed it up by saying, if it had been said by anyone else but myself, he shouldn’t have entered the house again. This rather unpleasantly terminated what might have been a cheerful evening. However, it was as well they went, for the charwoman had finished up the remains of the cold pork."
"4 月28 日公司里那个新来的年轻职员皮特，就是大约一周前对我非常无礼的那个人，又迟到了。我告诉他，我有责任报告头儿波卡普先生。让我吃惊的是，皮特非常谦恭，很绅士地给我道歉。看到他对我的态度改进不少，我打心底里高兴，并告诉他，对于他的迟到问题，我会继续监督。一个小时后我在办公室里走着，一个硬纸揉成的纸团又快又准地砸在我脸上，我立马转身，但所有的职员显然都在专心致志地工作。我不富裕，但我也愿意花半英镑来弄清楚，这纸团是无意扔的，还是蓄意的。早早地回家了，又买了些瓷漆——这次是黑色的——花了一晚上油漆了火炉围栏、相框，还有一双旧靴子，让它们看起来跟新的一样。还把高英落在这儿的手杖也漆了漆，使它看起来像乌木制的。","April 28.At the office, the new and very young clerk Pitt, who was very impudent to me a week or so ago, was late again. I told him it would be my duty to inform Mr. Perkupp, the principal. To my surprise, Pitt apologised most humbly and in a most gentlemanly fashion. I was unfeignedly pleased to notice this improvement in his manner towards me, and told him I would look over his unpunctuality. Passing down the room an hour later, I received a smart smack in the face from a rolled-up ball of hard foolscap. I turned round sharply, but all the clerks were apparently riveted to their work. I am not a rich man, but I would give half-a-sovereign to know whether that was thrown by accident or design. Went home early and bought some more enamel paint—black this time—and spent the evening touching up the fender, picture-frames, and an old pair of boots, making them look as good as new. Also painted Gowing’s walking-stick, which he left behind, and made it look like ebony."
"4 月29 日 礼拜日醒来时头痛得厉害，明显有感冒的症状。卡丽用她一贯倔强的口吻说这是“铅绞痛”，是我前几天总闻着油漆罐的缘故。我坚定地告诉她，自己怎么回事，我比她更清楚。我是着凉了，决定泡个热水澡，只要我能受得了，越热越好。热水放好了——真热啊，简直没法忍受了。我咬咬牙进了浴缸，很烫，但还算能接受。我静静地躺了一会儿。","April 29, Sunday.Woke up with a fearful headache and strong symptoms of a cold. Carrie, with a perversity which is just like her, said it was “painter’s colic,” and was the result of my having spent the last few days with my nose over a paint-pot. I told her firmly that I knew a great deal better what was the matter with me than she did. I had got a chill, and decided to have a bath as hot as I could bear it. Bath ready—could scarcely bear it so hot. I persevered, and got in; very hot, but very acceptable. I lay still for some time."
"我将手伸出水面时，受到了一辈子都没受过的惊吓——发现自己满手鲜血（我自己这么想），想象一下我有多恐惧。我首先想到的是我割破动脉了，血就要流干了，我要死了，一会儿被人发现了，样子就像另一个马拉，我记得在图索夫人蜡像馆见过他的样子。我接着就想到按铃，但想起来没有铃。最终我想到，其实根本没什么，是瓷漆，遇到热水融化了。我从浴缸里出来，浑身鲜红，就像我在东区剧院看到的北美印第安人。我决定一个字也不跟卡丽说，但要告诉法默森，让他周一来把浴缸漆成白色。","On moving my hand above the surface of the water, I experienced the greatest fright I ever received in the whole course of my life; for imagine my horror on discovering my hand, as I thought, full of blood. My first thought was that I had ruptured an artery, and was bleeding to death, and should be discovered, later on, looking like a second Marat6, as I remember seeing him in Madame Tussaud’s. My second thought was to ring the bell, but remembered there was no bell to ring. My third was, that there was nothing but the enamel paint, which had dissolved with boiling water. I stepped out of the bath, perfectly red all over, resembling the Indians I have seen depicted at an East-End theatre. I determined not to say a word to Carrie, but to tell Farmerson to come on Monday and paint the bath white."
"第四章","Chapter IV"
"伦敦市长官邸的舞会。4 月30 日颇感震惊，市长阁下和夫人邀请我和卡丽去市长官邸做客，去“见见商贸界的代表”。我的心怦怦跳得像小学生一样，我和卡丽将邀请函读了不只两三遍。我几乎吃不下早饭。我说——打心底里这么想——“卡丽，亲爱的，结婚那天，我领着你走在教堂走道上的时候，我很自豪；当我领着我亲爱的、美丽的妻子去市长官邸见市长阁下和夫人的时候，这种自豪感将如同我们结婚时一样或者更加炽烈。”我看到卡丽眼睛里含着泪，她说：“亲爱的查理，是我应该为你感到骄傲，我为你感到非常、非常自豪。你夸我漂亮，只要在你眼里我是漂亮的，我就很幸福了。亲爱的老查理，你不帅，但人好，这更难得。”我吻了她一下，她说：“不知道有没有舞会？我们好多年没跳过舞了。”","THE BALL AT THE MANSION HOUSE.April 30.Perfectly astounded at receiving an invitation for Carrie and myself from the Lord and Lady Mayoress to the Mansion House, to “meet the Representatives of Trades and Commerce.” My heartbeat like that of a schoolboy’s. Carrie and I read the invitation over two or three times. I could scarcely eat my breakfast. I said—and I felt it from the bottom of my heart, —“Carrie darling, I was a proud man when I led you down the aisle of the church on our wedding day; that pride will be equalled, if not surpassed, when I lead my dear, pretty wife up to the Lord and Lady Mayoress at the Mansion House.” I saw the tears in Carrie’s eyes, and she said: “Charlie dear, it is I who have to be proud of you. And I am very, very proud of you. You have called me pretty; and as long as I am pretty in your eyes, I am happy. You, dear old Charlie, are not handsome, but you are good, which is far more noble.” I gave her a kiss, and she said: “I wonder if there will be any dancing? I have not danced with you for years.”"
"我也说不清我是怎么了，就一把搂住她的腰，傻傻地跳起了狂热的波尔卡舞。这时萨拉进来了，咧着嘴笑着说：“太太，门口有个人问你们要不要点煤，质量上乘。”这真让人恼火。花了一晚上回复市长官邸的邀请函，写了撕，撕了写。已经跟萨拉说好要是高英或卡明斯来串门就说我们不在家。必须请教一下波卡普先生怎么给市长阁下回复邀请函。","I cannot tell what induced me to do it, but I seized her round the waist, and we were silly enough to be executing a wild kind of polka when Sarah entered, grinning, and said: “There is a man, mum, at the door who wants to know if you want any good coals.” Most annoyed at this. Spent the evening in answering, and tearing up again, the reply to the Mansion House, having left word with Sarah if Gowing or Cummings called we were not at home. Must consult Mr. Perkupp how to answer the Lord Mayor’s invitation."
"5 月1 日卡丽说：“我想将邀请函寄给妈妈看看。”我答应了，回复以后立马寄。在公司，我自豪地告诉波卡普先生，我们收到了市长官邸的邀请函；他的话让我大吃一惊，他说是他亲自将我的名字呈交给了市长阁下的秘书。我顿感这邀请函的价值大打折扣，但还是感谢了他；他回答了我的问题，给我讲了讲应该怎样回复邀请函。我觉得这回复也太简单了，不过当然还是波卡普先生最懂得该怎么做。","May 1.Carrie said: “I should like to send mother the invitation to look at.” I consented, as soon as I had answered it. I told Mr. Perkupp, at the off ice, with a feeling of pride, that we had received an invitation to the Mansion House; and he said, to my astonishment, that he himself gave in my name to the Lord Mayor’s secretary. I felt this rather discounted the value of the invitation, but I thanked him; and in reply to me, he described how I was to answer it. I felt the reply was too simple; but of course Mr. Perkupp knows best."
"5 月2 日把我的燕尾服和裤子送到了附近的小裁缝那里熨一下，去去皱。告诉高英下周一别来串门，因为我们要去市长官邸。也给卡明斯捎去了类似的话。","May 2.Sent my dress-coat and trousers to the little tailor’s round the corner, to have the creases taken out. Told Gowing not to call next Monday, as we were going to the Mansion House. Sent similar note to Cummings."
"5 月3 日卡丽去找萨顿的詹姆斯太太，商量下周一她的着装。我无意间跟我们一个头儿斯波奇说了去市长官邸的事，他说：“哦，我也收到邀请函了，但我想我不会去。”连斯波奇这样庸俗的人都收到邀请函了，我觉得我这邀请函更是大打折扣了。晚上，我没在家，小裁缝送来了我的衣服和裤子。因为萨拉连一先令也没有，没法付熨衣服的钱，他又将衣服拿走了。","May 3.Carrie went to Mrs. James, at Sutton, to consult about her dress for next Monday. While speaking incidentally to Spotch, one of our head clerks, about the Mansion House, he said: “Oh, I’m asked, but don’t think I shall go.” When a vulgar man like Spotch is asked I feel my invitation is considerably discounted. In the evening, while I was out, the little tailor brought round my coat and trousers, and because Sarah had not a shilling to pay for the pressing, he took them away again."
"5 月4 日卡丽的妈妈将市长阁下的邀请函还回来了，是我们寄去给她看一看的。她道歉说将一杯波尔图葡萄酒洒在上面了，我气得一句话也说不出来。","May 4.Carrie’s mother returned the Lord Mayor’s invitation, which was sent to her to look at, with apologies for having upset a glass of port over it. I was too angry to say anything."
"5 月5 日为下周一的事买了一副紫色山羊皮手套，还有两条白领带，以防系的时候会弄坏一条。","May 5.Bought a pair of lavender kid-gloves for next Monday, and two white ties, in case one got spoiled in the tying."
"5 月6 日 礼拜日非常无聊的布道，说来惭愧，期间我两次想到了明天市长官邸的招待会。","May 6, Sunday.A very dull sermon, during which, I regret to say, I twice thought of the Mansion House reception to-morrow."
"5 月7 日值得纪念的喜庆日子，即市长阁下的招待会。全家人都手忙脚乱。我不得不六点半就穿好衣服，因为卡丽想独占房间。詹姆斯太太从萨顿赶来帮卡丽；卡丽还让佣人萨拉也全力帮她，因此，我不由觉得她的要求很过分。萨拉不停地进进出出，给“太太取这取那”，有好几次，我不得不穿着整套晚礼服去开后门。","May 7.A big red-letter day; viz., the Lord Mayor’s reception. The whole house upset. I had to get dressed at half-past six, as Carrie wanted the room to herself. Mrs. James had come up from Sutton to help Carrie; so I could not help thinking it unreasonable that she should require the entire attention of Sarah, the servant, as well. Sarah kept running out of the house to fetch “something for missis,” and several times I had, in my full evening-dress, to answer the back-door."
"最后一次来的是蔬果店的伙计，他没看清楚是我，因为萨拉还没有点煤气灯。这伙计将两棵白菜和六个煤块一股脑塞到我手里。我愤怒地将这些东西丢在地上，气得忘了自己的身份，不由地给了那伙计个耳光。他哭着离开了，说要告我，不管怎样，我不会让这件事发生的。黑暗中，我踩到了一棵白菜，一下子摔到了石板上。我一阵眩晕，等恢复过来后我爬着上了楼，进了客厅，在玻璃灯罩上照了照，发现下巴流血了，衬衫被煤球弄脏了，左裤腿膝盖那儿也擦破了。","The last time it was the greengrocer’s boy, who, not seeing it was me, for Sarah had not lighted the gas, pushed into my hands two cabbages and half-a-dozen coal-blocks. I indignantly threw them on the ground, and felt so annoyed that I so far forgot myself as to box the boy’s ears. He went away crying, and said he should summons me, a thing I would not have happen for the world. In the dark, I stepped on a piece of the cabbage, which brought me down on the flags all of a heap. For a moment I was stunned, but when I recovered I crawled upstairs into the drawing-room, and on looking into the chimney-glass discovered that my chin was bleeding, my shirt smeared with the coal blocks, and my left trouser torn at the knee."
"不过詹姆斯太太又给我拿过来一件衬衫，我在客厅将它换上了。我在下巴上贴了一张橡皮膏，萨拉十分巧妙地把裤腿膝盖那里擦破的地方缝好了。九点钟卡丽从容优雅地走进屋，看起来像个女王。我从来都没有见过她这么可爱，这么高贵。她穿着天蓝色（我最喜欢的颜色）的绸缎礼服，肩上披着一段蕾丝花带，是詹姆斯太太借给她的，作为最后修饰。我觉得礼服后面或许有点太长了，前面又明显太短，可詹姆斯太太说这就是时尚。詹姆斯太太可热心了，借给了卡丽一把插着红羽毛的象牙扇，她说这扇子是无价之宝，因为这羽毛是喀楚鹰的——现在这种鸟已经灭绝了。我更喜欢卡丽在舒尔布莱德商店花三先令六便士买的小白扇子，但两位女士立马反对我。","However, Mrs. James brought me down another shirt, which I changed in the drawing-room. I put a piece of court-plaister on my chin, and Sarah very neatly sewed up the tear at the knee. At nine o’clock Carrie swept into the room, looking like a queen. Never have I seen her look solovely, or so distinguished. She was wearing a satin dress of sky-blue—my favourite colour—and a piece of lace, which Mrs. James lent her, round the shoulders, to give a finish. I thought perhaps the dress was a little too long behind, and decidedly too short in front, but Mrs. James said it was à la mode. Mrs. James was most kind, and lent Carrie a fan of ivory with red feathers, the value of which, she said, was priceless, as the feathers belonged to the Kachu eagle—a bird now extinct. I preferred the little white fan which Carrie bought for three-and-six at Shoolbred’s, but both ladies sat on me at once."
"我们到达市长官邸时还太早，这太走运了，因为我有机会跟尊敬的市长大人聊聊，他屈尊跟我聊了几分钟，和蔼可亲；可我得说，他甚至都不认识我们头儿波卡普先生，这让我很失望。","We arrived at the Mansion House too early, which was rather fortunate, for I had an opportunity of speaking to his lordship, who graciously condescended to talk with me some minutes; but I must say I was disappointed to find he did not even know Mr. Perkupp, our principal."
"我觉得我们是受一个自己都不认识市长阁下的人之邀来到市长官邸。来宾纷纷都到了，我永远不会忘记那壮观的场面，怪我笔力笨拙，无法描述出来。卡丽不停地说：“我们谁都不认识，这多遗憾呀！”这让我有点恼火。","I felt as if we had been invited to the Mansion House by one who did not know the Lord Mayor himself. Crowds arrived, and I shall never forget the grand sight. My humble pen can never describe it. I was a little annoyed with Carrie, who kept saying: “Isn’t it a pity we don’t know anybody?”"
"有一次，卡丽真是昏了头。我看到有个人看上去很像派克汉姆的弗朗清， 正要朝那个人走去，突然间，卡丽一把抓住我的衣服后摆，特别大声地说：“别丢下我。”这惹得一位穿着宫廷礼服、戴着项链的年长绅士和两位女士突然大笑起来。晚宴厅里人山人海， 并且， 哎呀！ 晚宴相当丰盛——喝不完的香槟酒。","Once she quite lost her head. I saw someone who looked like Franching, from Peckham, and was moving towards him when she seized me by the coat-tails, and said quite loudly: “Don’t leave me,” which caused an elderly gentleman, in a court-suit, and a chain round him, and two ladies, to burst out laughing. There was an immense crowd in the supper-room, and, my stars! it was a splendid supper—any amount of champagne."
"卡丽美餐了一顿，这让我非常高兴；因为有时候我觉得她不够壮实。她几乎尝遍了所有的菜。我很渴，吃不下太多东西。我的肩膀上被人重重拍了一下，转过身，吃了一惊，看到了法默森先生，我们那儿的五金商。他用老熟人的口气说：“这比布里克菲尔德街要好，是吧？”我只是看着他，冷冷地说：“我从来都没想到能在这儿看见你。”他粗鲁地大笑，说：“亏你说得出口——你能来，我怎么就不能来？”我回答说：“当然。”我多希望能想出更好的话来回应他。他说：“我能为你的漂亮太太要点东西吗？”卡丽说：“不用了，谢谢您。”她这样说，我真高兴。我用责怪的语气对他说：“你今天没有按我的要求过来漆浴缸。”法默森说：“不好意思，普特先生，社交场合莫谈公事。”","Carrie made a most hearty supper, for which I was pleased; for I sometimes think she is not strong. There was scarcely a dish she did not taste. I was so thirsty, I could not eat much. Receiving a sharp slap on the shoulder, I turned, and, to my amazement, saw Farmerson, our ironmonger. He said, in the most familiar way: “This is better than Brickfield Terrace, eh?” I simply looked at him, and said coolly: “I never expected to see you here.” He said, with a loud, coarse laugh: “I like that—if you, why not me?” I replied: “Certainly.” I wish I could have thought of something better to say. He said: “Can I get your good lady anything?” Carrie said: “No, I thank you,” for which I was pleased. I said, by way of reproof to him: “You never sent to-day to paint the bath, as I requested.” Farmerson said: “Pardon me, Mr. Pooter, no shop when we’re in company, please.”"
"我还没想出应答的话，一位郡行政司法长官，穿着全套法庭制服，拍了一下法默森的背，跟他像老朋友一样打招呼，还让法默森去他的寓所用餐。我很是吃惊。足足五分钟他们站在那里开怀大笑，互相戳着对方的肋骨，不停地说对方一点都不显老。然后他们相互拥抱，喝着香槟。","Before I could think of a reply, one of the sheriffs, in full Court costume, slapped Farmerson on the back and hailed him as an old friend, and asked him to dine with him at his lodge. I was astonished. For full five minutes they stood roaring with laughter, and stood digging each other in the ribs. They kept telling each other they didn’t look a day older. They began embracing each other and drinking champagne."
"想想看，给我们修刮泥板的人居然认识我们上流社会的人！我正要跟卡丽离开，法默森粗鲁地一把抓住我的衣领，跟那位郡行政司法长官说：“我给你介绍一下，我的邻居普特。”他连个“先生”都不说。这位郡行政司法长官递给我一杯香槟，不管怎么样，我觉得跟他喝杯酒还是很荣幸的，我也是这么跟他说的。我们站着聊了一会儿，最后我说：“我现在去陪普特太太，请多多包涵。”我走到卡丽身边，她说：“别因为我而离开你的朋友呀，我孤零零一个人站在人群里，谁也不认识，‘高兴’得很呢！”","To think that a man who mends our scraper should know any member of our aristocracy! I was just moving with Carrie, when Farmerson seized me rather roughly by the collar, and, addressing the sheriff, said: “Let me introduce my neighbour, Pooter.” He did not even say “Mister.” The sheriff handed me a glass of champagne. I felt, after all, it was a great honour to drink a glass of wine with him, and I told him so. We stood chatting for some time, and at last I said: “You must excuse me now if I join Mrs. Pooter.” When I approached her, she said: “Don’t let me take you away from friends. I am quite happy standing here alone in a crowd, knowing nobody!”"
"一个人是怎么也吵不成架的，再说现在吵架既不是时候也不是地方，于是我一把搂过卡丽，说：“我希望我娇小可爱的妻子能跟我一起跳舞，哪怕只是为了说，我们作为市长阁下的客人，在市长官邸里跳过舞。”看到晚宴后舞会没那么正式，而且我也清楚卡丽以前是多么崇拜我的舞技，于是我搂着卡丽的腰，我们跳起了华尔兹。","As it takes two to make a quarrel, and as it was neither the time nor the place for it, I gave my arm to Carrie, and said: “I hope my darling little wife will dance with me, if only for the sake of saying we had danced at the Mansion House, as guests of the Lord Mayor.” Finding the dancing after supper was less formal, and knowing how much Carrie used to admire my dancing in the days gone by, I put my arm round her waist and we commenced a waltz."
"一件极其不幸的意外发生了。我穿了一双新靴子。我太蠢了，当时没有听卡丽的话，她让我在鞋底上用剪刀尖划一划，或把鞋底上弄湿点儿。我刚开始跳舞，左脚下一滑，就摔倒在地上，像闪电一样。脑袋一侧重重地磕在了地板上，以致于有一、两秒钟，我不知道发生了什么。不用说，卡丽也跟我重重地摔倒了，弄断了头发上插着的小梳子，肘部也擦破了。","A most unfortunate accident occurred. I had got on a new pair of boots. Foolishly, I had omitted to take Carrie’s advice; namely, to scratch the soles of them with the points of the scissors or to put a little wet on them. I had scarcely started when, like lightning, my left foot slipped away and I came down, the side of my head striking the floor with such violence that for a second or two I did not know what had happened. I need hardly say that Carrie fell with me with equal violence, breaking the comb in her hair and grazing her elbow."
"屋子里一阵哄堂大笑，但当人们发现我们真的受伤时，笑声戛然而止。一位先生将卡丽扶到座位上，我非常强烈地表示，地板只抛光，却不铺地毯或粗毛毯以防止大家滑倒，这很危险。那位先生，他说他的名字叫大卫茨，坚持要陪卡丽去喝杯酒，我乐意让卡丽接受这个邀请。","There was a roar of laughter, which was immediately checked when people found that we had really hurt ourselves. A gentleman assisted Carrie to a seat, and I expressed myself pretty strongly on the danger of having a plain polished floor with no carpet or drugget to prevent people slipping. The gentleman, who said his name was Darwitts, insisted on escorting Carrie to have a glass of wine, an invitation which I was pleased to allow Carrie to accept."
"我跟在后面，碰上了法默森，他立即用他那高嗓门说：“嗨，你就是摔倒了的那位吗？”","I followed, and met Farmerson, who immediately said, in his loud voice: “Oh, are you the one who went down?”"
"我一脸愤怒地瞪了他一眼，作为回应。","I answered with an indignant look."
"他用粗俗的语气说：“嘿，看看，老伙计，我们太老了，玩儿不了这种游戏了。这些又蹦又跳的事得留给年轻人干了。来吧，再喝一杯，那才更合适我们。”","With execrable taste, he said: “Look here, old man, we are too old for this game. We must leave these capers to the youngsters. Come and have another glass, that is more in our line.”"
"尽管我觉得我答应他是在买他闭嘴，但我们还是跟着其他人一起进了晚宴厅。","Although I felt I was buying his silence by accepting, we followed the others into the supper-room."
"倒霉的意外发生后，我和卡丽都不想再多呆了。我们离开的时候，法默森说：“你们要走吗？要走的话，让我搭个便车吧。”","Neither Carrie nor I, after our unfortunate mishap, felt inclined to stay longer. As we were departing, Farmerson said: “Are you going? if so, you might give me a lift.”"
"我觉得最好答应，但还是希望能先跟卡丽商量一下。","I thought it better to consent, but wish I had first consulted Carrie."
"第五章","Chapter V"
"市长官邸舞会以后，卡丽生气了。高英也生气了。卡明斯家愉快的派对。派克汉姆的弗朗清先生来我家作客。","AFTER THE MANSION HOUSE BALL. CARRIE OFFENDED.GOWING ALSO OFFENDED. A PLEASANT PARTY AT THE CUMMINGS’. MR. FRANCHING, OF PECKHAM, VISITS US."
"5 月8 日我醒来头痛得十分厉害，几乎什么都看不见，而且脖子后面的筋好像扭了。我先是想着请个大夫来，可又觉得没必要。起来以后，感觉很晕，就去了药剂师布朗尼施那里，他给我开了一剂药。在公司感觉很不舒服，只好请假回家了。去了市里另一家药店，又买了一剂药。布朗尼施的药好像弄得我更严重了，一整天都没吃东西。更糟糕的是卡丽，每次我跟她说话，她都很刻薄地回答我——这还得是在她搭理我的时候。","May 8.I woke up with a most terrible headache. I could scarcely see, and the back of my neck was as if I had given it a crick. I thought first of sending for a doctor; but I did not think it necessary. When up, I felt faint, and went to Brownish’s, the chemist, who gave me a draught. So bad at the office, had to get leave to come home. Went to another chemist in the City, and I got a draught. Brownish’s dose seems to have made me worse; have eaten nothing all day. To make matters worse, Carrie, every time I spoke to her, answered me sharply—that is, when she answered at all."
"晚上，我又感觉严重了很多，就跟她说：“我真的觉得我是昨晚在市长官邸吃龙虾蛋黄酱中毒了。”她眼睛都没离开她的针线活，只说了句：“你从来都喝不了香槟酒。”我感觉很恼火，说：“你胡说啥呀！我只喝了一杯半，你和我一样清楚——”我话还没说完，她就跳起来冲出了房间。我坐了一个多小时，等着她回来，可她没回。于是我决定去睡觉了。却发现卡丽连“晚安”都没说就睡了，抛下我去闩盥洗室的门，还要喂猫。早上我一定要跟她说说这事。","In the evening I felt very much worse again and said to her: “I do believe I’ve been poisoned by the lobster mayonnaise at the Mansion House last night;” she simply replied, without taking her eyes from her sewing: “Champagne never did agree with you.” I felt irritated, and said: “What nonsense you talk; I only had a glass and a half, and you know as well as I do—” Before I could complete the sentence she bounced out of the room. I sat over an hour waiting for her to return; but as she did not, I determined I would go to bed. I discovered Carrie had gone to bed without even saying “good-night”; leaving me to bar the scullery door and feed the cat. I shall certainly speak to her about this in the morning."
"5 月9 日还是有点虚弱，长了黑斑。《黑修士双周新闻报》上刊登了一长串参加市长官邸舞会的客人名单。发现把我们的名字漏掉了，很失望，可法默森的名字却清清楚楚地列在上面，后面还跟着“M.L.L.”的字样，且不管这是啥意思。更让人恼火的是，我们已经定了一打报纸，准备寄给朋友们。写信给《黑修士双周新闻报》，指出他们的疏忽大意。","May 9.Still a little shaky, with black specks. The Blackfriars Bi-weekly News, contains a long list of the guests at the Mansion House Ball. Disappointed to find our names omitted, though Farmerson’s is in plainly enough with M.L.L. after it, whatever that may mean. More than vexed, because we had ordered a dozen copies to send to our friends. Wrote to the Black friars Bi-weekly News, pointing out their omission."
"我进小客厅的时候，卡丽已经开始用早餐了，我自己倒了杯茶，然后心平气和地轻声说：“卡丽，我希望你能稍微解释一下你昨天晚上的行为。”","Carrie had commenced her breakfast when I entered the parlour. I helped myself to a cup of tea, and I said, perfectly calmly and quietly: “Carrie, I wish a little explanation of your conduct last night.”"
"她回答说：“真是的！我还想让你好好解释解释你前天晚上的行为，可不止是稍微解释一下。”","She replied, “Indeed! and I desire something more than a little explanation of your conduct the night before.”"
"我不慌不忙地说：“可是，我确实不懂你在说啥。”","I said, coolly: “Really, I don’t understand you.”"
"卡丽冷笑着说：“或许是不懂；你几乎没明白过啥。”","Carrie said sneeringly: “Probably not; you were scarcely in a condition to understand anything.”"
"这冷嘲热讽让我大吃一惊，于是我失声叫道：“卡洛琳！”","I was astounded at this insinuation and simply ejaculated: “Caroline!”"
"她说：“别跟演戏似的，我不吃你这一套。留着这种口气给你的新朋友法默森先生吧，那个五金商。”","She said: “Don’t be theatrical, it has no effect on me. Reserve that tone for your new friend, Mister Farmerson, the ironmonger.”"
"我正要说话，卡丽让我闭嘴，从来都没见过她发这么大的脾气。她说：“现在我要说说！声称要糗糗法默森先生，却让人家当着我的面糗了你，接着还接受人家的邀请，去跟人家喝杯香槟，你还喝了不止一杯。然后还让这个可恶的家伙在我们回家时搭我们的便车，他给我们修刮泥板时也搞砸过。他上马车的时候把我的礼服扯破了，还踩了詹姆斯太太贵重的扇子，扇子是你把它从我手里碰掉的，这些事我什么都没说，但是他连道歉的话也没有；你们一路上抽烟，连征求我同意这样的礼貌都没有。这还不够，快到家时，他搭了车连一个子儿都不付，即便如此，你还让他到家来。好在他够清醒，从我的态度上看出来他不受欢迎。”","I was about to speak, when Carrie, in a temper such as I have never seen her in before, told me to hold my tongue. She said: “Now I’m going to say something! After professing to snub Mr.Farmerson, you permit him to snub you, in my presence, and then accept his invitation to take a glass of champagne with you, and you don’t limit yourself to one glass. You then offer this vulgarman, who made a bungle of repairing our scraper, a seat in our cab on the way home. I say nothing about his tearing my dress in getting in the cab, nor of treading on Mrs. James’s expensive fan, which you knocked out of my hand, and for which he never even apologised; but you smoked all the way home without having the decency to ask my permission. That is not all. At the end of the journey, although he did not offer you a farthing towards his share of the cab, you asked him in. Fortunately, he was sober enough to detect, from my manner, that his company was not desirable.”"
"天知道这让我觉得够丢脸的了；可更糟糕的是，高英没敲门就进来了，头上戴了两顶帽子，手里拿着花园里用的耙子，脖子上围着卡丽的毛披肩（他从楼下厅里的衣帽架上拿的），粗声粗气地为自己大声通报：“市长阁下！”他像小丑一样，在屋里游行了两圈，发现我们都不理他，便说：“喂！怎么了？小两口吵架了呀？”","Goodness knows I felt humiliated enough at this; but, to make matters worse, Gowing entered the room, without knocking, with two hats on his head and holding the garden-rake in his hand, with Carrie’s fur tippet (which he had taken off the downstairs hall-peg) round his neck, and announced himself in a loud, coarse voice: “His Royal Highness, the Lord Mayor!” He marched twice round the room like a buffoon, and, finding we took no notice, said: “Hulloh! what’s up? Lovers’ quarrel, eh?” "
"一阵沉默之后，我平静地说：“我亲爱的高英，我身体不舒服，没心思开玩笑；尤其是你进屋不敲门，我没看出来这有什么好玩儿的。”","There was a silence for a moment, so I said quietly: “My dear Gowing, I’m not very well, and not quite in the humour for joking; especially when you enter the room without knocking, an act which I fail to see the fun of.”"
"高英说：“很抱歉，可我是来取我的手杖的，我本以为你会给我送过去呢。”我把手杖递给他，我记得用瓷漆漆成黑色了，想把它弄得好看点。他一脸茫然地看着手杖，片刻之后，他说：“这是谁干的？”","Gowing said: “I’m very sorry, but I called for my stick, which I thought you would have sent round.” I handed him his stick, which I remembered I had painted black with the enamel paint, thinking to improve it. He looked at it for a minute with a dazed expression and said: “Who did this? ”"
"我说：“哦，怎么了？”","I said: “Eh, did what? ”"
"他说：“怎么了？哎呀，毁了我的手杖了！它是我那已故的叔叔的，在我眼里，它比我在这个世界上拥有的任何东西都要珍贵！我会搞清楚这是谁干的。”","He said: “Did what? Why, destroyed my stick! It belonged to my poor uncle, and I value it more than anything I have in the world! I’ll know who did it.”"
"我说：“非常抱歉，我猜想油漆会掉的。我这样干也是好意啊。”","I said: “I’m very sorry. I daresay it will come off. I did it for the best.”"
"高英说：“那我只能说，你自作主张太讨厌了；我还要加一句，你是个比你看起来还要笨的大笨蛋，只是那完全不可能了。”","Gowing said: “Then all I can say is, it’s a confounded liberty; and I would add, you’re a bigger fool than you look, only that’s absolutely impossible.”"
"5 月12 日只买了一份《黑修士双周新闻报》，上面刊登着一小串上次漏掉的名字；可那帮笨蛋把我们的名字写成了“C. 波特先生和太太”。真让人恼火！我又写了封信，特地用大写字母把我们的名字写出来——普特，P-O-O-T-E-R，这样，这次该不会出错了。","May 12.Got a single copy of the Blackfriars Bi-weekly News. There was a short list of several names they had omitted; but the stupid people had mentioned our names as “Mr. and Mrs. C. Porter.” Most annoying! Wrote again and I took particular care to write our name in capital letters, POOTER, so that there should be no possible mistake this time."
"5 月16 日真是愤怒极了， 打开今天的《黑修士双周新闻报》，发现下面这段话：“我们已经收到两封查尔斯. 皮特先生和太太的来信，要求我们宣布他们参加了市长官邸舞会这个重要的事实。”我将报纸撕了，丢到了废纸篓里。我的时间太宝贵了，为这些琐事烦恼不值当。","May 16.Absolutely disgusted on opening the Blackfriars Bi-weekly News of today, to find the following paragraph: “We have received two letters from Mr. and Mrs. Charles Pewter, requesting us to announce the important fact that they were at the Mansion House Bal1.” I tore up the paper and threw it in the waste-paper basket. My time is far too valuable to bother about such trifles."
"5 月21 日上周或者说十来天无聊得很，卡丽去了萨顿的詹姆斯太太那里，卡明斯也不在。高英，我猜他还生我的气呢，因为我没问他就用瓷漆将他的手杖漆成黑色了。","May 21.The last week or ten days terribly dull, Carrie being away at Mrs. James’s, at Sutton. Cummings also away. Gowing, I presume, is still offended with me for black-enamelling his stick without asking him."
"5 月22 日买了根新的镶着银片的手杖，花了七先令六便士（得告诉卡丽花了五先令），然后给高英送去，附带了一封态度友好的短信。","May 22.Purchased a new stick mounted with silver, which cost seven-and sixpence(shall tell Carrie five shillings), and sent it round with nice note to Gowing."
"5 月23 日收到来自高英的奇怪短信；他说：“生气？一点儿都没有，伙计。我原以为你因为我发火，生我的气了呢。还有，最后我发现你漆过的手杖不是我那已故的老叔叔的，它只是我花了一先令在一个烟草商那儿买的。不管怎么说，我还是要感谢你给我的漂亮礼物。”","May 23.Received strange note from Gowing; he said: “Offended? not a bit, my boy. I thought you were offended with me for losing my temper. Besides, I found after all, it was not my poor old uncle’s stick you painted. It was only a shilling thing I bought at a tobacconist’s. However, I am much obliged to you for your handsome present all same.”"
"5 月24 日卡丽回来了。太好了！她看起来神采奕奕，只是鼻子有点晒伤了。","May 24.Carrie back. Hoorah! She looks wonderfully well, except that the sun has caught her nose."
"5 月25 日卡丽拿下来几件我的衬衫，让我拿到拐角处特里普裁缝那里。她说：“前面和袖口都磨得厉害。”我想都没想就来了句：“我估摸着也是。”天哪！我们放声大笑，我还以为再也停不下来了呢。我在去城里的公共马车上，碰巧坐在了车夫旁边，就给他讲了“磨破的”衬衫的笑话。我觉得他笑得快从座上滚下来了。在公司，他们听完这笑话，也笑了好一阵子。","May 25.Carrie brought down some of my shirts and advised me to take them to Trillip’s round the corner. She said: “The fronts and cuffs are much frayed.” I said without a moment’s hesitation: “I’m ’frayed1 they are.” Lor! how we roared. I thought we should never stop laughing. As I happened to be sitting next the driver going to town on the ’bus, I told him my joke about the “frayed” shirts. I thought he would have rolled off his seat. They laughed at the office a good bit too over it."
"5 月26 日把衬衫留在了特里普裁缝店。我对他说：“我估摸着它们磨破了。”他一点都没笑，说：“先生，它们肯定会磨破的。”有些人似乎特别缺乏幽默感。","May 26.Left the shirts to be repaired at Trillip’s. I said to him: “I’m ’fraid they are frayed.” He said, without a smile: “They’re bound to do that, sir.” Some people seem to be quite destitute of a sense of humour."
"6 月1 日上周又跟以前的日子一样了，卡丽回来了，高英和卡明斯几乎每晚都来串门。有两次我们在花园里坐到很晚。今晚我们像一群小孩子一样，玩“连环问答式叙事游戏”。真好玩。","June 1.The last week has been like old times, Carrie being back, and Gowing and Cummings calling every evening nearly. Twice we sat out in the garden quite late. This evening we were like a pack of children, and played “consequences2.” It is a good game."
"6 月2 日今晚又玩“连环问答式叙事游戏”，不如昨晚玩得成功；高英几次都编得不得体。","June 2.“Consequences” again this evening. Not quite so successful as last night; Gowing having several times over stepped the limits of good taste."
"6 月4 日晚上，我和卡丽去了卡明斯夫妇家，跟他们度过了一个安静的夜晚。高英也在那儿，还有斯蒂尔布鲁克先生。今晚虽然安静，但很愉快。卡明斯太太唱了五、六首歌，在我这拙耳听来，《不，先生》和《沉睡的花园》唱得最好；但我听着最开心的要数她和卡丽的二重唱——也是经典二重唱。歌名好像叫作《我会那样的，我的爱人！》，美妙极了。要是卡丽的嗓音再好点儿，我想专业歌手唱得也没她俩好。晚饭后，我们让她俩又唱了一遍。自从那个礼拜日散步去“奶牛藩篱”以后，我就一点儿也不喜欢斯蒂尔布鲁克先生了，但我得承认他滑稽歌曲唱得不错。他唱的《我们现在不想要这些老家伙》，尤其是提到格拉德斯通先生的那一段歌词，逗得我们放声大笑；但我觉得他漏掉了一节歌词，我也这么说了，但高英觉得这段是整首歌中最好的了。","June 4.In the evening Carrie and I went round to Mr. and Mrs.Cummings’ to spend a quiet evening with them. Gowing was there, also Mr. Stillbrook. It was quiet but pleasant. Mrs. Cummings sang five or six songs, “No, Sir,” and “The Garden of Sleep,” being best in my humble judgment; but what pleased me most was the duet she sang with Carrie—classical duet, too. I think it is called, “I Would That My Love!” It was beautiful. If Carrie had been in better voice, I don’t think professionals could have sung it better. After supper we made them sing it again. I never liked Mr. Stillbrook since the walk that Sunday to the “Cow and Hedge,” but I must say he sings comic-songs well. His song: “We Don’t Want the Old Men Now,” made us shriek with laughter, especially the verse referring to Mr. Gladstone; but there was one verse I think he might have omitted, and I said so, but Gowing thought it was the best of the lot."
"6 月6 日特里普给我拿来了衬衫，可恶的是他缝补的要价比我买新的都贵。我跟他这么说，他却无礼地回答：“可现在这衬衫比新的时候还要好呀。”我付给他钱，说这就是抢劫嘛。他说：“要是你想衬衫前襟用叫花子穿的亚麻布，像包装或订书用的那种，你当时为什么不说啊？”","June 6.Trillip brought round the shirts and, to my disgust, his charge for repairing was more than I gave for them when new. I told him so, and he impertinently replied: “Well, they are better now than when they were new.” I paid him, and said it was a robbery. He said: “If you wanted your shirt-fronts made out of pauper-linen, such as is used for packing and bookbinding, why didn’t you say so?”"
"6 月7 日一件极其烦人的事。碰上了弗朗清先生，他住在派克汉姆，事业上是个很了不起的人物。我冒昧地请他来我家用点午后茶点，然后吃顿便饭。我觉得他不会接受我这么卑微的邀请；可是他接受了，非常友好地说他宁愿跟我们“勉强吃点”，也不愿意自己一个人吃。我说：“我们最好乘这辆蓝色公共马车。”他回答说：“我不坐蓝色车。我最近够郁闷的了。铜荒中我赔了整整‘一千块’呢。上这个车吧。”","June 7.A dreadful annoyance. Met Mr. Franching, who lives at Peckham, and who is a great swell in his way. I ventured to ask him to come home to meat-tea, and take pot-luck. I did not think he would accept such a humble invitation; but he did, saying, in a most friendly way, he would rather “peck” with us than by himself. I said: “We had better get into this blue ’bus.” He replied: “No blue bussing for me. I have had enough of the blues lately. I lost a cool ‘thou’ over the Copper Scare. Step in here.”"
"我们乘一辆双轮双座马车回家，很气派。我在前门敲了三次也没人答应。透过磨砂玻璃板（上面有星状点缀）我看到卡丽匆匆上楼。我让弗朗清先生在门口等等，而我自己绕到了侧门。我看到杂货店的伙计竟然正在那儿抠门上已经起泡的油漆。没功夫骂他；而是绕过去，从厨房窗户进了屋。我开门让弗朗清先生进来，带他进了客厅。我上楼找卡丽，她正在换衣服，我告诉她我已经说服了弗朗清先生来家里。她回答说：“你怎么能这样啊？你知道萨拉现在休假，家里什么都没有，天热了，冷羊肉也坏了。”","We drove up home in style, in a hansom-cab, and I knocked three times at the front door without getting an answer. I saw Carrie, through the panels of ground-glass (with stars), rushing upstairs. I told Mr. Franching to wait at the door while I went round to the side. There I saw the grocer’s boy actually picking off the paint on the door, which had formed into blisters. No time to reprove him; so went round and effected an entrance through the kitchen window. I let in Mr. Franching, and showed him into the drawing-room. I went upstairs to Carrie, who was changing her dress, and told her I had persuaded Mr. Franching to come home. She replied: “How can you do such a thing? You know it’s Sarah’s holiday, and there’s not a thing in the house, the cold mutton having turned with the hot weather.”"
"最后卡丽还是迅速下楼——她向来是个好人，洗了茶杯，铺了桌布。我让弗朗清先生看看我们的一些日本风景画，而我跑到肉铺去买了三块排骨。","Eventually Carrie, like a good creature as she is, slipped down, washed up the tea-cups, and laid the cloth, and I gave Franching our views of Japan to look at while I ran round to the butcher’s to get three chops."
"7 月30 日这糟糕的寒冷天气，害得不是我就是卡丽，要不就是我俩同时心情不好。我们似乎无缘无故就会突然争吵起来，而且这种不愉快的事情一般发生在吃饭的时候。","July 30.The miserable cold weather is either upsetting me or Carrie, or both. We seem to break out into an argument about absolutely nothing, and this unpleasant state of things usually occurs at meal times."
"今天早上，说不清为啥，我们就聊到了气球，我俩都非常开心；可话题不觉转到了家务事上，卡丽无缘无故就用很不客气的语气说起我那可怜的父亲在金钱上遇到的麻烦。我反驳道：“无论如何，爸爸是个有身份的人。”卡丽听了突然大哭起来，我完全吃不下早饭了。","This morning, for some unaccountable reason, we were talking about balloons, and we were as merry as possible; but the conversation drifted into family matters, during which Carrie, without the slightest reason, referred in the most uncomplimentary manner to my poor father’s pecuniary trouble. I retorted by saying that “Pa, at all events, was a gentleman,” whereupon Carrie burst out crying. I positively could not eat any breakfast."
"在公司，波卡普先生来叫我过去。他说非常抱歉，我得从下周六开始休年假。弗朗清先生在我上班时过来，邀请我去他的“保健”俱乐部用餐。我担心今早发生“口角”后呆在家里会不愉快，就给卡丽发了封电报，告诉她我出去吃晚饭，不用熬夜等我了。给卡丽买了只银的小手镯。","At the office I was sent for by Mr. Perkupp, who said he was very sorry, but I should have to take my annual holidays from next Saturday. Franching called at office and asked me to dine at his club, “The Constitutiona3.” Fearing disagreeables at home after the “tiff” this morning, I sent a telegram to Carrie, telling her I was going out to dine and she was not to sit up. Bought a little silver bangle for Carrie."
"7 月31 日昨晚，我睡觉前把小手镯放在了卡丽的梳妆台上，还附了张贴心的便条。卡丽非常喜欢这手镯。我告诉卡丽，我们不得不下周六就开始休假，她非常开心地回答说她不介意，只是天气太不好了，而且她担心姬彭斯小姐也不能及时给她送来泳衣。我告诉卡丽，我觉得有粉色蝴蝶结的那件褐色泳衣就看起来相当不错。卡丽说她不想穿那件。我正想再说说这事，突然想起来昨天的争吵，决定还是闭嘴了。","July 31.Carrie was very pleased with the bangle, which I left with an affectionate note on her dressing-table last night before going to bed. I told Carrie we should have to start for our holiday next Saturday. She replied quite happily that she did not mind, except that the weather was so bad, and she feared that Miss Jibbons would not be able to get her a seaside dress in time. I told Carrie that I thought the drab one with pink bows looked quite good enough; and Carrie said she should not think of wearing it. I was about to discuss the matter, when, remembering the argument yesterday, resolved to hold my tongue."
"我对卡丽说：“我觉得我们再也找不到比‘老好布罗德斯泰斯’更好的去处了。”让我惊讶的是，卡丽不但反对去布罗德斯泰斯——这可是第一次，而且还求我不要用“老好”这样的词，而是把它留给斯蒂尔布鲁克先生和他那一类的其他绅士们用。听到我要乘的公共马车从窗外经过，我不得不冲出家门，都没有像往常一样亲亲卡丽；我对她喊道：“留给你决定吧。”晚上回家，卡丽说她觉得因为时间太短，还是决定去布罗德斯泰斯，而且已经给海港风景街的贝克太太写了封信，好预订房间。","I said to Carrie: “I don’t think we can do better than ‘Good old Broadstairs.’ ” Carrie not only, to my astonishment, raised an objection to Broadstairs, for the first time, but begged me not to use the expression, “Good old,” but to leave it to Mr. Stillbrook and other gentlemen of his type. Hearing my ’bus pass the window, I was obliged to rush out of the house without kissing Carrie as usual, and I shouted to her: “I leave it to you to decide.” On returning in the evening, Carrie said she thought as the time was so short she had decided on Broadstairs, and had written to Mrs.Beck, Harbour View Terrace, for apartments."
"8 月1 日在爱德华兹裁缝铺定做了一条新裤子，告诉他们不要把靴口处裁得太松；上一条裤子靴口处就太松了，膝盖处又太紧，看起来像水手裤。以致于我从公司那个讨厌的年轻人皮特桌旁走过时，听到他大喊“角笛”。卡丽跟姬彭斯小姐定做了件粉色加里波第衫，还有一条蓝色哔叽裙子，我一直觉得这一身在海边穿看着很漂亮。晚上，她自己剪了顶可爱的小水手帽，而我给她念着《市场交易报》。她弄好后，我戴上帽子试了试，逗得我们哈哈大笑；卡丽说这帽子配上我的胡子可笑极了，如果我这样上台表演，人们会笑成啥样啊。","August 1.Ordered a new pair of trousers at Edwards’s, and told them not to cut them so loose over the boot; the last pair being so loose and also tight at the knee, looked like a sailor’s, and I heard Pitt, that objectionable youth at the office, call out “Hornpipe3” as I passed his desk. Carrie has ordered of Miss Jibbons a pink Garibaldi4 and blue-serge skirt, which I always think looks so pretty at the seaside. In the evening she trimmed herself a little sailor-hat, while I read to her the Exchange and Mart. We had a good laugh over my trying on the hat when she had finished it; Carrie saying it looked so funny with my beard, and how the people would have roared if I went on the stage like it."
"8 月2 日贝克太太来信说我们在布罗德斯泰斯可以住往常住过的房子，这下我们就放心了。买了件花衬衫，还有一双棕色靴子——我看到城里很多时髦的职员都这么穿，听说这些都很“入时”。","August 2.Mrs. Beck wrote to say we could have our usual rooms at Broadstairs. That’s off our mind. Bought a coloured shirt and a pair of tan-coloured boots, which I see many of the swell clerks wearing in the City, and hear are all the “go.”"
"8 月3 日天气很好，期待着明天。卡丽买了把大约五英尺长的阳伞。我跟她说这伞有点滑稽。她说：“萨顿的詹姆斯太太有一把，比我这个还长一倍呢！”这个话题就到此为止了。因为海边天气太热，所以我买了顶挺好的帽子。我不知道它叫啥，但是是印度人戴的那种头盔的形状，只不过是稻草编的。在罗普兄弟店买了三条新领带、两块花手绢，还有一双深蓝色袜子。花了整个晚上收拾行李。卡丽告诉我别忘了跟黑格斯沃斯先生借望远镜。他总借给我，因为知道我懂得如何保管。让萨拉去取望远镜。一切似乎都很顺利，这时，最后一班邮差给我们送来一封贝克太太的信，信中说：“我刚把所有的房间包给了一个团，我很抱歉得收回我先前的话，也很抱歉你们得到别家找地方了；不过隔壁的沃明太太会很乐意给你们提供住处，但得到周一以后才行，因为她的房间在整个银行假日周都预订出去了。","August 3.A beautiful day. Looking forward to to-morrow. Carrie bought a parasol about five feet long. I told her it was ridiculous. She said: “Mrs. James, of Sutton, has one twice as long;” so the matter dropped. I bought a capital hat for hot weather at the seaside. I don’t know what it is called, but it is the shape of the helmet worn in India, only made of straw. Got three new ties, two coloured handkerchiefs, and a pair of navy-blue socks at Pope Brothers. Spent the evening packing. Carrie told me not to forget to borrow Mr. Higgsworth’s telescope, which he always lends me, knowing I know how to take care of it. Sent Sarah out for it. While everything was seeming so bright, the last post brought us a letter from Mrs. Beck, saying: “I have just let all my house to one party, and am sorry I must take back my words, and am sorry you must find other apartments; but Mrs. Womming, next door, will be pleased to accommodate you, but she cannot take you before Monday, as her rooms are engaged Bank Holiday week.”"
"1 磨损的，该词与“ 恐怕”（afraid）同音， 该句中本应该使用后者，用前者是为了与前文中的“frayed”呼应，达到幽默效果。2 连环问答式叙事游戏，室内游戏的一种，参与者依次写下一系列问题的答案，最后将所有回答拼成一个两个人见面及其结果的幽默故事。3 角笛，既可表示一种乐器，又可表示角笛舞，是从前流行于水手中的一种生动活泼的单人舞。4 加里波第衫， 按意大利民族解放运动领袖加里波第及其拥护者所穿红衬衫仿制的一种宽大罩衫， 为妇女和小孩所穿。",""
"第六章","Chapter VI "
"我们儿子威利. 卢品. 普特意外回家。","THE UNEXPECTED ARRIVAL HOME OF OUR SON, WILLIE LUPIN POOTER."
"8 月4 日第一班邮差送来一封信，读着真开心，是我们亲爱的儿子威利寄来的，告知收到了卡丽寄给他的小礼物——前天是他二十岁生日。让我们十分诧异的是，他下午居然出现在我们面前，他是直接从奥尔德姆回来的。他说跟银行请了假，因为礼拜一放假，他想着可以给我们个小小的惊喜。","August 4.The first post brought a nice letter from our dear son Willie, acknow ledging a trifling present which Carrie sent him, the day before yesterday being his twentieth birthday. To our utter amazement he turned up himself in the afternoon, having journeyed all the way from Oldham. He said he had got leave from the bank, and as Monday was a holiday he thought he would give us a little surprise."
"8 月5 日 礼拜日自从去年圣诞节后，我们就没见过威利，这次见面发现他已经长成了年轻帅气的小伙子，特别高兴。人们准不信他是卡丽的儿子。他看起来更像卡丽的弟弟。我很不赞成他在礼拜日穿一套花格子衣服，而且我想今早他本应该去教堂的，可他说昨天旅途劳累，所以我忍住没再说这件事。晚饭我们喝了一瓶波尔图葡萄酒，为爱子威利的健康干杯。他说：“对了，顺便问问，我有没有告诉你们我已经不用我的教名‘威廉’，而只用第二名字‘卢品’了？实际上，在奥尔德姆，人们只知道我叫‘卢品. 普特’。要是在那儿你们叫我‘威利’，他们都不知道你们说啥。”","August 5, Sunday.We have not seen Willie since last Christmas, and are pleased to notice what a fine young man he has grown. One would scarcely believe he was Carrie’s son. He looks more like a younger brother. I rather disapprove of his wearing a check suit on a Sunday, and I think he ought to have gone to church this morning; but he said he was tired after yesterday’s journey, so I refrained from any remark on the subject. We had a bottle of port for dinner, and drank dear Willie’s health. He said: “Oh, by-the-by, did I tell you I’ve cut my first name, ‘William,’ and taken the second name ‘Lupin’? In fact, I’m only known at Oldham as ‘Lupin Pooter.’ If you were to ‘Willie’ me there, they wouldn’t know what you meant.”"
"当然，卢品只不过是个姓氏，然而卡丽听了却很高兴，开始讲起卢品家族悠久的历史。我小心地说，我觉得威廉这个名字既简单又好听，还提醒他这名是洗礼时随威廉叔叔起的，在市里，人们都很尊敬他。威利的态度让我不太喜欢，他冷笑着说：“噢，那事我全都知道——老好人比尔！”然后又自顾自地喝了第三杯波尔图葡萄酒。","Of course, Lupin being a purely family name, Carrie was delighted, and began by giving a long history of the Lupins. I ventured to say that I thought William a nice simple name, and reminded him he was christened after his Uncle William, who was much respected in the City. Willie, in a manner which I did not much care for, said sneeringly: “Oh, I know all about that—Good old Bill!” and helped himself to a third glass of port."
"卡丽坚决反对我说“老好人”，可威利叠用了“老”和“好”两个形容词，她却什么都没说。我没说话，只是盯着她看，这意味更深长。我说：“我亲爱的威利，我希望你在银行与同事们相处得融洽。”他回答说：“请叫我卢品。提到银行，那儿没有一个职员是绅士，‘老板’是个无赖。”我惊呆了，一句话也说不出来，直觉告诉我情况不妙。","Carrie objected strongly to my saying “Good old,” but she made no remark when Willie used the double adjective. I said nothing, but looked at her, which meant more. I said: “My dear Willie, I hope you are happy with your colleagues at the Bank.” He replied: “Lupin, if you please; and with respect to the Bank, there’s not a clerk who is a gentleman, and the ‘boss’ is a cad.” I felt so shocked, I could say nothing, and my instinct told me there was something wrong."
"8 月6 日 银行假日九点了，卢品还没有动静，我敲了敲他的门，说我们通常八点半吃早饭，问他还要多久。卢品回答说整个晚上他过得可热闹了。先是火车一整夜把房子震得晃晃悠悠的，后来又是太阳光透过窗户照进来，刺着他的眼，现在他头痛得要裂开似的。卡丽上来问他想不想让她把早饭送上来，他说喝杯茶就行了，不想吃东西。","August 6, Bank Holiday.As there was no sign of Lupin moving at nine o’clock, I knocked at his door, and said we usually breakfasted at half-past eight, and asked how long would he be? Lupin replied that he had had a lively time of it, first with the train shaking the house all night, and then with the sun streaming in through the window in his eyes, and giving him a cracking headache. Carrie came up and asked if he would like some breakfast sent up, and he said he could do with a cup of tea, and didn’t want anything to eat."
"卢品还没有下来，一点半的时候我又上楼了，说我们两点吃午饭；他说“到时会下来”，可直到差一刻三点了才下来。我说：“我们还没看够你呢，可你又得坐五点半的火车回去了；也就是说再有一个小时你就得走了，除非你坐半夜的邮车。”他说：“好啦，老爸，再绕弯子也没用了，我已经跟银行提出辞职了。”","Lupin not having come down, I went up again at half-past one, and said we dined at two; he said he “would be there.” He never came down till a quarter to three. I said: “We have not seen much of you, and you will have to return by the 5:30 train; therefore you will have to leave in an hour, unless you go by the midnight mail.” He said: “Look here, Guv’nor, it’s no use beating about the bush. I’ve tendered my resignation at the Bank.”"
"好一阵子我都说不出话来，等再回过神来，我说：“你怎么敢这样呢，先生？你怎么敢不跟我商量就做出这么重大的决定呢？别回答我，先生！——马上坐下，按我说的写封信，收回你的辞呈，并为你的轻率鲁莽好好道个歉。”","For a moment I could not speak. When my speech came again, I said: “How dare you, sir? How dare you take such a serious step without consulting me? Don’t answer me, sir!—you will sit down immediately, and write a note at my dictation, withdrawing your resignation and amply apologising for your thoughtlessness.”"
"他大笑着回答：“没用了，你们想知道‘老好’真相吧，我被炒啦！”想象一下听到这话我有多沮丧。","Imagine my dismay when he replied with a loud guffaw: “It’s no use. If you want the good old truth, I’ve got the chuck!”"
"8 月7 日波卡普先生同意我推迟一周休假了，因为我们定不着房间。这也给我们一个机会，在走之前尽量给威利找份工作。我毕生的希望就是让他进波卡普的公司。","August 7.Mr. Perkupp has given me leave to postpone my holiday a week, as we could not get the room. This will give us an opportunity of trying to find an appointment for Willie before we go. The ambition of my life would be to get him into Mr. Perkupp’s firm."
"8 月11 日尽管卢品需要我们来负责，这是个严重的问题，但了解了他被银行解雇只是因为“他对这份工作不感兴趣，上班总迟到一个小时（有时候是两个小时）”，我们也就放心了。我们周一都可以安心地去布罗德斯泰斯了，这能让我摆脱前些日子的烦恼，这些天都浪费在跟奥尔德姆银行经理徒劳的通信上了。","August 11.Although it is a serious matter having our boy Lupin on our hands, still it is satisfactory to know he was asked to resign from the Bank simply because “he took no interest in his work, and always arrived an hour (sometimes two hours) late.” We can all start off on Monday to Broadstairs with a light heart. This will take my mind off the worry of the last few days, which have been wasted over a useless correspondence with the manager of the Bank at Oldham."
"8 月13 日好棒啊！到布罗德斯泰斯了。房子在火车站旁，非常漂亮。要是在悬崖边，得是两倍的价钱。下午五点，房东太太准备好了丰盛的晚餐和茶点，我们大家都非常喜欢，可卢品似乎有点挑剔，因为碰巧黄油里有只苍蝇。晚上雨很大，这让我很高兴，因为这可是个早点上床睡觉的好借口。卢品说他还要坐会儿，看看书。","August 13.Hurrah! at Broadstairs. Very nice apartments near the station. On the cliffs they would have been double the price. The landlady had a nice five o’clock dinner and tea ready, which we all enjoyed, though Lupin seemed fastidious because there happened to be a fly in the butter. It was very wet in the evening, for which I was thankful, as it was a good excuse for going to bed early. Lupin said he would sit up and read a bit."
"8 月14 日我发现卢品昨晚没有看书，而是去大会堂看了有些庸俗的娱乐表演，有点生气。我发表了自己的意见，说这样的表演不配体面人去光顾，可他回答说：“噢，也就‘仅此一晚’，我当时有点心烦，于是想着去看看英格兰‘独特火花’波莉. 布莱斯威尔的表演。”我告诉他，我可以自豪地说，我从没听说过这个人。卡丽说：“你就别管孩子了，他都这么大了，能照顾好自己，不会忘了自己是个体面人的。别忘了，你自己也年轻过。”大雨下了一整天，但卢品还是要出去。","August 14.I was a little annoyed to find Lupin, instead of reading last night, had gone to a common sort of entertainment, given at the Assembly Rooms. I expressed my opinion that such performances were unworthy of respectable patronage; but he replied: “Oh, it was only ‘for one night only.’ I had a fit of the blues come on, and thought I would go to see Polly Press well, England’s Particular Spark.” I told him I was proud to say I had never heard of her. Carrie said: “Do let the boy alone. He’s quite old enough to take care of himself, and won’t forget he’s a gentleman. Remember, you were young once yourself.” Rained all day hard, but Lupin would go out."
"8 月15 日天有点放晴了，于是我们全家乘火车去了马盖特。我们在码头碰上的第一个人竟是高英。我说：“喂，我还以为你跟你伯明翰的朋友们去巴茅斯了呢？”他说：“对，可小彼得. 劳伦斯病得很重，他们推迟了去那儿的日子，所以我就来这儿了。你们知道卡明斯一家也在这儿吗？”卡丽说：“这样啊，太好了。我们一定找几个晚上好好聚聚，玩玩游戏。”","August 15.Cleared up a bit, so we all took the train to Margate, and the first person we met on the jetty was Gowing. I said: “Hulloh! I thought you had gone to Barmouth with your Birmingham friends?” He said: “Yes, but young Peter Lawrence was so ill, they postponed their visit, so I came down here. You know the Cummings’ are here too?” Carrie said: “Oh, that will be delightful! We must have some evenings together and have games.”"
"我介绍卢品说：“你们会很高兴看到我们亲爱的儿子回来了！”高英说：“怎么回事？你不会是想说他不在银行干了吧？”","I introduced Lupin, saying: “You will be pleased to find we have our dear boy at home!” Gowing said: “How’s that? You don’t mean to say he’s left the Bank?”"
"我很快岔开话题，这样免得高英问些令人尴尬的问题，他套这些问题总有诀窍。","I changed the subject quickly, and thereby avoided any of those awkward questions which Gowing always has a knack of asking."
"8 月16 日卢品断然拒绝和我一起在街上散步，因为我戴着新草帽，穿着双排扣礼服。我不知道这孩子会成什么样。","August 16.Lupin positively refused to walk down the Parade with me because I was wearing my new straw helmet with my frock-coat. I don’t know what the boy is coming to."
"8 月17 日卢品不同意我们的提议，我就和卡丽去划船了。跟卡丽单独在一起，可让我松了口气，因为卢品惹我生气的时候，她总站在卢品那边。我们一回来，卢品就说：“你们去坐了‘先令催吐机’，是不是？下次你们就该去坐六便士的‘颠肝机’了吧。”我想他指的是一种三轮车，但我装着不明白他说什么。","August 17.Lupin not falling in with our views, Carrie and I went for a sail. It was a relief to be with her alone; for when Lupin irritates me, she always sides with him. On our return, he said: “Oh, you’ve been on the ‘Shilling Emetic,’ have you? You’ll come to six-pennorth on the ‘Liver Jerker’ next.” I presume he meant a tricycle, but I affected not to understand him."
"8 月18 日高英和卡明斯过来安排去马盖特过一夜。外面下着雨，高英让卡明斯跟他去旅馆打台球。他知道我从来不玩，事实上也并不赞成玩这种游戏。卡明斯说他得快点回马盖特，让我大为震惊的是，听到这话，卢品却说：“我跟你玩，高英——一百回合，绕着台球桌走走，我会胃口大开。”我说：“或许高英先生不愿意跟小孩儿们玩。”让我大吃一惊的是，高英说：“噢，不，如果他们玩得好，我就玩。”然后他们一起走了。","August 18.Gowing and Cummings walked over to arrange an evening at Margate. It being wet, Gowing asked Cummings to accompany him to the hotel and have a game of billiards, knowing I never play, and in fact disapprove of the game. Cummings said he must hasten back to Margate; whereupon Lupin, to my horror, said: “I’ll give you a game, Gowing—a hundred up. A walk round the cloth will give me an appetite for dinner.” I said: “Perhaps Mister Gowing does not care to play with boys.” Gowing surprised me by saying: “Oh yes, I do, if they play well,” and they walked off together."
"8 月19 日 礼拜日我正要就卢品吸烟（对此他毫无节制）和打台球的事对他说教一番，他却戴上帽子，出去了。接着卡丽对我说教了好长时间，说我管卢品还像管小孩子一样，明显失策了。我觉得她有点道理，于是晚上我就递给卢品一根雪茄，他似乎挺高兴，可是吸了几口后说：“还不错，两便士一根吧——尝一根我的。”然后他递给我一根烟，要多呛有多呛，这可说明不少问题。","August 19, Sunday.I was about to read Lupin a sermon on smoking (which he indulges in violently) and billiards, but he put on his hat and walked out. Carrie then read me a long sermon on the palpable inadvisability of treating Lupin as if he were a mere child. I felt she was somewhat right, so in the evening I offered him a cigar. He seemed pleased, but, after a few whiffs, said: “This is a good old tup’ny—try one of mine,” and he handed me a cigar as long as it was strong, which is saying a good deal."
"8 月20 日我很高兴，我们在海边的最后一天过得不错，尽管天有点阴沉沉的。晚上，我们去了卡明斯那里（在马盖特），因为有点冷，我们呆在屋里玩游戏，高英像往常一样，玩过界了。他提议我们玩“肉排”，我们从来都没听说过这游戏。他坐在椅子上，让卡丽坐到他大腿上。对这样的邀请亲爱的卡丽很正当地拒绝了。","August 20.I am glad our last day at the seaside was fine, though clouded overhead. We went over to Cummings’ (at Margate) in the evening, and as it was cold, we stayed in and played games; Gowing, as usual, overstepping the mark. He suggested we should play “Cutlets,” a game we never heard of. He sat on a chair, and asked Carrie to sit on his lap, an invitation which dear Carrie rightly declined."
"争论一番后，我坐到高英膝盖上，卡丽坐在我的大腿边上，卢品坐在卡丽的大腿边上，然后卡明斯坐在卢品的大腿边上，卡明斯太太坐在他丈夫大腿边上。我们看起来很是滑稽，大家都笑了好一阵子。","After some species of wrangling, I sat on Gowing’s knees and Carrie sat on the edge of mine. Lupin sat on the edge of Carrie’s lap, then Cummings on Lupin’s and Mrs. Cummings on her husband’s. We looked very ridiculous, and laughed a good deal."
"然后高英说：“ 你们相信有‘ 伟大的莫卧儿人’吗？”我们得齐声回答：“是的——相信！”（重复三次）。高英说：“我也相信”，然后突然起身。这愚蠢玩笑的结果是我们都摔到了地上，可怜的卡丽脑袋撞到了壁炉挡板的角上。卡明斯太太给卡丽的伤口处抹了点醋。可因为这个我们误了最后一班火车，还得乘马车回布罗德斯泰斯，这花了我七先令六便士。","Gowing then said: “Are you a believer in the Great Mogul?” We had to answer all together: “Yes-oh, yes!” (three times). Gowing said: “So am I,” and suddenly got up. The result of this stupid joke was that we all fell on the ground, and poor Carrie banged her head against the corner of the fender. Mrs. Cummings put some vinegar on; but through this we missed the last train, and had to drive back to Broadstairs, which cost me seven-and-sixpence."
"第七章","Chapter VII"
"又回家了。詹姆斯太太影响了卡丽。给卢品找不到工作。隔壁邻居有点烦人。有人撕了我的日记。给卢品找了个工作。卢品宣布了一件事，让我们大吃一惊。","HOME AGAIN. MRS. JAMES’ INFLUENCE ON CARRIE. CAN GET NOTHING FOR LUPIN. NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOURS ARE A LITTLE TROUBLESOME. SOMEONE TAMPERS WITH MY DIARY. GOT A PLACE FOR LUPIN. LUPIN STARTLES US WITH AN ANNOUNCEMENT."
"8 月22 日家，又回到甜蜜的家了！卡丽买了几个漂亮的蓝色羊毛垫子，用来在上面放花瓶。福利普斯—翟纳斯公司来信说他们很抱歉，没有空缺的职位给卢品。","August 22.Home, sweet Home again! Carrie bought some pretty blue-wool mats to stand vases on. Fripps, Janus and Co. write to say they are sorry they have no vacancy among their staff of clerks for Lupin."
"8 月23 日我买了一对熟石膏做的棕色鹿头，他们看起来正适合我们的小厅，也让它增添了几分优雅的格调。鹿头仿造得很好。普勒斯和史密斯为它们无法为卢品提供工作而表示歉意。","August 23.I bought a pair of stags’ heads made of plaster-of-Paris and coloured brown. They will look just the thing for our little hall, and give it style; the heads are excellent imitations. Poolers and Smith are sorry they have nothing to offer Lupin.  "
"8 月24 日卡丽邀请詹姆斯太太从萨顿来我家玩两三天，只是想让卢品高兴点，给他打打气，因为他情绪有点低落。我们没对卢品透露半个字，只想留着给他个惊喜。","August 24.Simply to please Lupin, and make things cheerful for him, as he is a little down, Carrie invited Mrs. James to come up from Sutton and spend two or three days with us. We have not said a word to Lupin, but mean to keep it as a surprise."
"8 月25 日萨顿的詹姆斯太太下午来到我家，拿来一大束野花。我见詹姆斯太太的次数越多，就越觉得她人好。她对卡丽真心实意。她到卡丽的房间脱掉帽子，却在那呆了近一个小时，聊穿衣打扮。卢品说他对詹姆斯太太的到来一点都不感到奇怪，倒觉得她这个人奇怪。","August 25.Mrs. James, of Sutton, arrived in the afternoon, bringing with her an enormous bunch of wild flowers. The more I see of Mrs. James the nicer I think she is, and she is devoted to Carrie. She went into Carrie’s room to take off her bonnet, and remained there nearly an hour talking about dress. Lupin said he was not a bit surprised at Mrs. James’ visit, but was surprised at her."
"8 月26 日 礼拜日詹姆斯太太整个上午都在大谈特谈该穿什么衣服，做礼拜差点迟到了。卢品似乎跟她处不来。恐怕我们要跟上周三搬来的邻居有点麻烦了。他们的几个朋友，驾着几辆双轮轻便马车来他家，已经让我们反感了。","August 26, Sunday.Nearly late for church, Mrs. James having talked considerably about what to wear all the morning. Lupin does not seem to get on very well with Mrs. James. I am afraid we shall have some trouble with our next-door neighbours who came in last Wednesday. Several of their friends, who drive up in dog-carts, have already made them selves objectionable."
"前一两天晚上，为了凉快点儿，我穿了件白背心，正当我拇指插在背心兜里（我的习惯）走着，坐在车里的一个人，看起来像个美国人，开始胡乱唱起了粗俗无聊的歌，大概是“我背心口袋里有十三块钱”。我觉得这是在唱我，后来这个猜疑得到了证实。因为今天下午我戴着大礼帽在花园里走了一会儿，有人故意朝我帽子扔过来一个摔炮，像雷管一样在我帽子上炸了。我猛地转身，真真切切地看到上次在马车里的那个人正往卧室的一扇窗户后面躲。","An evening or two ago I had put on a white waistcoat for coolness, and while walking past with my thumbs in my waistcoat pockets (a habit I have), one man, seated in the cart, and looking like an American, commenced singing some vulgar nonsense about “I had thirteen dollars in my waistcoat pocket.” I fancied it was meant for me, and my suspicions were confirmed; for while walking round the garden in my tall hat this afternoon a “throw-down” cracker was deliberately aimed at my hat, and exploded on it like a percussion cap. I turned sharply, and am positive I saw the man who was in the cart retreating from one of the bedroom windows."
"8 月27 日卡丽和詹姆斯太太去逛街了，我下班回到家，她们还没回来。从后来的谈话来看，我想詹姆斯太太正给卡丽灌输许多关于穿衣打扮的乱七八糟的事儿。我走到高英家，叫他晚上去我家吃晚饭，大家可以高兴点儿。","August 27.Carrie and Mrs. James went off shopping, and had not returned when I came back from the office. Judging from the subsequent conversation, I am afraid Mrs. James is filling Carrie’s head with a lot of nonsense about dress. I walked over to Gowing’s and asked him to drop in to supper, and make things pleasant."
"晚餐卡丽准备了点速食，有那块剩下的冷的烤肉，一小片鲑鱼（我没吃，怕一人一块都不够），一块牛奶冻和几块奶油蛋羹，餐具柜上还有一小瓶波尔图葡萄酒，几块果酱泡芙。詹姆斯太太带大家玩一个很有意思的纸牌游戏，叫“扮鬼脸”。玩着玩着，卢品起身，并用很讽刺的语气说：“对不起，这种游戏对我来说速度太快了，我要去后花园玩安静的弹球游戏。”这让我很惊讶，更确切地说是有点反感。","Carrie prepared a little extemporised supper, consisting of the remainder of the cold joint, a small piece of salmon (which I was to refuse, in case there was not enough to go round), and a blancmange and custards. There was also a decanter of port and some jam puffs on the side board. Mrs. James made us play rather a good game of cards, called “Muggings.” To my surprise, in fact disgust, Lupin got up in the middle, and, in a most sarcastic tone, said: “Pardon me, this sort of thing is too fast for me. I shall go and enjoy a quiet game of marbles in the back-garden.”"
"要不是高英（他似乎已经开始喜欢卢品了）提议说他们可以创造游戏，场面可能会更难堪。卢品说：“我们扮‘猴子’吧。”他便带高英满屋子跑，还把他领到了穿衣镜前。我得承认我被这逗得哈哈大笑。后来每个人都在因为什么好玩的事大笑，可也不解释为什么，我有点恼火。后来，直到要睡觉时我才发现礼服后摆的一个扣子上挂了一个椅套，我肯定一晚上都挂着它走来走去。","Things might have become rather disagreeable but for Gowing (who seems to have taken to Lupin) suggesting they should invent games. Lupin said: “Let’s play ‘monkeys.’” He then led Gowing all round the room, and brought him in front of the looking-glass. I must confess I laughed heartily at this. I was a little vexed at everybody subsequently laughing at some joke which they did not explain, and it was only on going to bed I discovered I must have been walking about all the evening with an antimacassar on one button of my coat-tails."
"8 月28 日发现天竺葵花圃中间有一块大砖头，明显是从隔壁扔过来的。帕特斯兄弟公司没有空缺职位给卢品。","August 28.Found a large brick in the middle bed of geraniums, evidently come from next door. Pattles and Pattles can’t find a place for Lupin."
"8 月29 日詹姆斯太太着实捉弄了卡丽一把。卡丽穿着一件像欧洲农民的长罩衫一样的新裙子，她说“长罩衫”正火着呢，我回答说这真让我火大。她还戴了顶像厨房煤斗那么大的帽子，样子也一样。詹姆斯太太回家了，我和卢品都有点高兴——这是自从他回来后，我俩第一次就一件事达成一致意见。莫肯斯父子公司写信说他们没有空缺职位给卢品。","August 29.Mrs. James is making a positive fool of Carrie. Carrie appeared in a new dress like a smock-frock. She said “smocking” was all the rage. I replied it put me in a rage. She also had on a hat as big as a kitchen coal-scuttle, and the same shape. Mrs. James went home, and both Lupin and I were somewhat pleased—the first time we have agreed on a single subject since his return. Merkins and Son write they have no vacancy for Lupin."
"10 月30 日我很想知道是谁故意把我过去五六周的日记撕掉了, 真是太可恶了！我的日记本是个大拍纸簿，有很多空，足够记录每天的事。为了坚持记事，我受了不少罪（并引以为荣）。","October 30.I should very much like to know who has wilfully torn the last five or six weeks out of my diary. It is perfectly monstrous! Mine is a large scribbling diary, with plenty of space for the record of my everyday events, and in keeping up that record I take (with much pride) a great deal of pains."
"我问卡丽知不知道这件事，她回答说只能怪我自己，明知家里有打日工的清洁女佣和烟囱清理工在，还偏把日记到处乱扔。我说她答非所问，我觉得我的反驳相当巧妙，要不是我的胳膊肘碰到桌子——这桌子是临时放到过道里的——将桌子上的花瓶打翻、摔碎了，这反驳说不定会更有效。","I asked Carrie if she knew anything about it. She replied it was my own fault for leaving the diary about with a charwoman cleaning and the sweeps in the house. I said that was not an answer to my question. This retort of mine, which I thought extremely smart, would have been more effective had I not jogged my elbow against a vase on a table temporarily placed in the passage, knocked it over, and smashed it."
"这个意外让卡丽非常生气，因为这花瓶跟另外一个是一对，配都配不上了。这是我们婚礼那天，卡丽的表亲鲍莫森夫妇（不久前住在多尔斯顿）的一个老朋友波赛特太太送给我们的。我把萨拉叫进来，问她日记的事。她说她根本就没进过客厅，烟囱清理工走了以后，比勒尔太太（打日工的女佣）已经自己打扫好房间，点着了壁炉。我发现壁炉里有块烧剩的纸片，仔细看了看，发现就是一页我的日记。因此，显然有人撕了我的日记来生火。我要求比勒尔太太明天来见我。","Carrie was dreadfully upset at this disaster, for it was one of a pair of vases which cannot be matched, given to us on our wedding-day by Mrs. Burtsett, an old friend of Carrie’s cousins, the Pommertons, late of Dalston. I called to Sarah, and asked her about the diary. She said she had not been in the sitting-room at all; after the sweep had left, Mrs. Birrell (the char woman) had cleaned the room and lighted the fire herself. Finding a burnt piece of paper in the grate, I examined it, and found it was a piece of my diary. So it was evident someone had torn my diary to light the fire. I requested Mrs. Birrell to be sent to me to-morrow."
"10 月31 日收到我们头儿波卡普先生的来信，信中说他终于知道有个缺位了，可以让我们亲爱的儿子卢品去。这算是对我丢了几页日记的一点安慰吧。因为我得承认，过去几周，我一直在求人替卢品找工作，得到的都是令人失望的答复，而我记录的也全是这些内容。比勒尔太太来了，她回答我说：“她从来都没见过书，更别说擅自碰它了。”","October 31.Received a letter from our principal, Mr. Perkupp, saying that he thinks he knows of a place at last for our dear boy Lupin. This, in a measure, consoles me for the loss of a portion of my diary; for I am bound to confess the last few weeks have been devoted to the record of disappointing answers received from people to whom I had applied for appointments for Lupin. Mrs. Birrell called, and, in reply to me, said: “She never see no book, much less take such a liberty as touch it.”"
"我说我下定决心要找出是谁干的。听了我的话，她说会尽力帮我，可她记得烟囱清理工生火用的是几张《回声报》。我提出让烟囱清理工明天来见我。我真希望卡丽没给卢品大门钥匙；我们一直连他的影儿都见不着。为了等他，我熬夜到一点多，后来累了，睡了。","I said I was determined to find out who did it, whereupon she said she would do her best to help me; but she remembered the sweep lighting the fire with a bit of the Echo. I requested the sweep to be sent to me to-morrow. I wish Carrie had not given Lupin a latchkey; we never seem to see anything of him. I sat up till past one for him, and then retired tired."
"11 月1 日昨天日记中写道“累了，睡了”，当时没发现，还挺逗的。要不是现在那么着急，我本来可能会开个小玩笑。烟囱清理工来了，可竟敢一直走到门厅，还把脏兮兮的煤灰袋子靠在门口台阶上。但他很有礼貌，我没法责怪他。他说是萨拉生的火，这不幸让萨拉听见了，因为她当时正好在擦楼梯扶手。她跑下来，朝烟囱清理工大发脾气，两个人在门前台阶上大吵一架。无论什么原因我本不该让这种事发生，我让萨拉去忙她的事，还告诉烟囱清理工我很抱歉麻烦他。我确实挺抱歉，他来一趟，搞得门口台阶上全是煤灰。我愿意出十先令，找出是谁撕了我的日记。","November 1.My entry yesterday about “retired tired,” which I did not notice at the time, is rather funny. If I were not so worried just now, I might have had a little joke about it. The sweep called, but had the audacity to come up to the hall-door and lean his dirty bag of soot on the doorstep. He, however, was so polite, I could not rebuke him. He said Sarah lighted the fire. Unfortunately, Sarah heard this, for she was dusting the banisters, and she ran down, and flew into a temper with the sweep, causing a row on the front door-steps, which I would not have had happen for anything. I ordered her about her business, and told the sweep I was sorry to have troubled him; and so I was, for the door-steps were covered with soot in consequence of his visit. I would willingly give ten shillings to find out who tore my diary."
"11 月2 日晚上，我和卡丽安静地呆着，跟她怎么也呆不够。我们聊着《婚姻是不是个失败？》这首诗的意义，聊得非常开心。我们的婚姻一点儿都不失败。我们聊着一起度过的幸福日子，不知不觉已经过了午夜。我们听到重重的关门声，吓了一跳。卢品回来了，他没想着要关楼道的煤气灯，甚至都没朝我们所在的房间瞅瞅，而是直接上楼睡了，弄出很大的响动。我让他下楼来一会儿，他请求原谅，因为他“累得要死”。可这句话与事实根本不符，因为过了一刻钟，他竟在屋里跳起舞来，还大喊：“看看我跳波尔卡舞！”诸如此类，胡言乱语。","November 2.I spent the evening quietly with Carrie, of whose company I never tire. We had a most pleasant chat about the letters on “Is Marriage a Failure?” It has been no failure in our case. In talking over our own happy experiences, we never noticed that it was past midnight. We were startled by hearing the door slam violently. Lupin had come in. He made no attempt to turn down the gas in the passage, or even to look into the room where we were, but went straight up to bed, making a terrible noise. I asked him to come down for a moment, and he begged to be excused, as he was “dead beat,” an observation that was scarcely consistent with the fact that, for a quarter of an hour afterwards, he was positively dancing in his room, and shouting out, “See me dance the polka!” or some such nonsense."
"11 月3 日终于有好消息了，波卡普先生给卢品安排了一个职位，卢品周一去看看行不行。天哪，我终于松了口气！我到卢品的房间，想将这个好消息告诉他，可他还躺在床上，有些不舒服，所以我决定等晚上再告诉他。","November 3.Good news at last. Mr. Perkupp has got an appointment for Lupin, and he is to go and see about it on Monday. Oh, how my mind is relieved! I went to Lupin’s room to take the good news to him, but he was in bed, very seedy, so I resolved to keep it over till the evening."
"他说昨晚他被选作一家名为“霍洛韦喜剧演员会”的业余戏剧俱乐部的会员，尽管玩得挺开心，但坐在风口，搞得头部神经痛。他说早餐什么都不想吃，因此我就离开了。","He said he had last night been elected a member of an Amateur Dramatic Club, called the “Holloway Comedians”; and, though it was a pleasant evening, he had sat in a draught, and got neuralgia in the head. He declined to have any breakfast, so I left him."
"晚上，我开了一瓶特酿的波尔图葡萄酒，说来奇怪，卢品竟没出去。我们倒上酒，我说：“卢品，我的孩子，我有意想不到的好消息要告诉你。波卡普先生已经给你安排了个职位！”卢品说：“太好了！”于是我们干了杯酒。","In the evening I had up a special bottle of port, and, Lupin being in for a wonder, we filled our glasses, and I said: “Lupin my boy, I have some good and unexpected news for you. Mr. Perkupp has procured you an appointment!” Lupin said: “Good biz!” and we drained our glasses."
"然后卢品说：“再满上，因为我也有意想不到的好消息要告诉你们。”","Lupin then said: “Fill up the glasses again, for I have some good and unexpected news for you.”"
"我有点儿担心，很明显卡丽也是这样，因为她说：“我希望我们能觉得是好消息。”","I had some slight misgivings, and so evidently had Carrie, for she said: “I hope we shall think it good news.”"
"卢品说：“噢，没问题！我订婚了！”","Lupin said: “Oh, it’s all right! I’m engaged to be married!”"
"第八章","Chapter VIII"
"唯一的话题——黛西. 马特勒。卢品的新工作。在卡明斯家放烟花。“霍洛韦喜剧演员会”。萨拉和打日工的女佣吵架。卢品不合宜的干涉。认识了黛西. 马特勒。为表敬意，我们决定在家办一个聚会。","DAISY MUTLAR SOLE TOPIC OF CONVERSATION. LUPIN’S NEW BERTH. FIREWORKS AT THE CUMMINGS’. THE “HOLLOWAY COMEDIANS.” SARAH QUARRELS WITH THE CHARWOMAN. LUPIN’S UNCALLED-FOR INTERFERENCE.AM INTRODUCED TO DAISY MUTLAR. WE DECIDE TO GIVE A PARTY IN HER HONOUR."
"11 月5 日 礼拜日我和卡丽都很担心，卢品还是个孩子，什么都没跟我们商量就订婚了。晚饭后他把所有的事情都告诉我们了。他说，这个女孩的名字叫黛西.马特勒，她是他见过最可爱、最漂亮、最有才的女孩。他对她一见钟情，就算得等五十年他也愿意，他知道这女孩也会等他。","November 5, Sunday.Carrie and I troubled about that mere boy Lupin getting engaged to be married without consulting us or anything. After dinner he told us all about it. He said the lady’s name was Daisy Mutlar, and she was the nicest, prettiest, and most accomplished girl he ever met. He loved her the moment he saw her, and if he had to wait fifty years he would wait, and he knew she would wait for him."
"卢品继续热切地说，对他来说，现在整个世界都不一样了——是个值得生活的世界。现在，他的生活有了目标，那就是把黛西. 马特勒变成黛西. 普特。他还保证，黛西. 马特勒肯定不会给普特家族丢脸。说到这里，卡丽突然大哭起来，一把搂住卢品的脖子，害得卢品把手里的整杯波尔图葡萄酒都倒在新的浅色裤子上了。","Lupin further said, with much warmth, that the world was a different world to him now, —it was a world worth living in. He lived with an object now, and that was to make Daisy Mutlar—Daisy Pooter, and he would guarantee she would not disgrace the family of the Pooters. Carrie here burst out crying, and threw her arms round his neck, and in doing so, upset the glass of port he held in his hand all over his new light trousers."
"我说，毫无疑问，等见到马特勒小姐，我们会喜欢她的，可卡丽说她已经喜欢马特勒小姐了。我觉得这未免太早些了吧，可憋着没说什么。今天接下来的时间，黛西. 马特勒成为唯一的话题。我问卢品她家里都有些什么人，他回答说：“噢，你认识的，马特勒，威廉斯和瓦特。”我不认识，但当下也没再问，害怕惹得卢品烦了。","I said I had no doubt we should like Miss Mutlar when we saw her, but Carrie said she loved her already. I thought this rather premature, but held my tongue. Daisy Mutlar was the sole topic of conversation for the remainder of the day. I asked Lupin who her people were, and he replied: “Oh, you know Mutlar, Williams and Watts.” I did not know, but refrained from asking any further questions at present, for fear of irritating Lupin."
"11 月6 日卢品跟我一起去了公司，同我们头儿波卡普先生聊了很久，结果他同意去乔布. 克里纳兹股票经纪公司当职员。卢品私底下告诉我，这是个广告公司，他觉得不怎么样。我回答说：“乞丐是没权力挑食的。”说句公道话，卢品看起来很为自己惭愧。","November 6.Lupin went with me to the office, and had a long conversation with Mr. Perkupp, our principal, the result of which was that he accepted a clerkship in the firm of Job Cleanands & Co., Stock and Share Brokers. Lupin told me, privately, it was an advertising firm, and he did not think much of it. I replied: “Beggars should not be choosers;” and I will do Lupin the justice to say, he looked rather ashamed of himself."
"晚上，我们顺道去卡明斯家放了些烟花。下起了雨，我觉得这很无聊。我的一个爆竹没炸，高英说：“在鞋上磕磕就会炸，伙计。”我在鞋后跟上磕了几下，爆竹炸了，发出一声巨响，还把我指头炸伤了，挺严重的。我把剩下的爆竹给了卡明斯的小儿子去放了。","In the evening we went round to the Cummings’, to have a few fireworks. It began to rain, and I thought it rather dull. One of my squibs would not go off, and Gowing said: “Hit it on your boot, boy; it will go off then.” I gave it a few knocks on the end of my boot, and it went off with one loud explosion, and burnt my fingers rather badly. I gave the rest of the squibs to the little Cummings’ boy to let off."
"又一件不幸的事发生了，惹得大家劈头盖脸地骂了我一顿。为了精彩收场，卡明斯将一个大的车轮形烟花绑在地面一个树桩上，作为压轴项目，还大惊小怪一番，说花了七先令呢。点的时候有点儿费劲，最后终于着了，但慢慢转了两圈就不转了。我拄着手杖，就轻轻敲了一下烟花，想让它转起来，不幸的是烟花从树桩上掉到了草里。大家都朝我咆哮，那架势，别人还以为我把房子点着了呢。我再也不参加焰火晚会了，真是可笑，既费时间又费钱。","Another unfortunate thing happened, which brought a heap of abuse on my head. Cummings fastened a large wheel set-piece on a stake in the ground by way of a grand finale. He made a great fuss about it; said it cost seven shillings. There was a little difficulty in getting it alight. At last it went off; but after a couple of slow revolutions, it stopped. I had my stick with me, so I gave it a tap to send it round, and, unfortunately, it fell off the stake on to the grass. Anybody would have thought I had set the house on fire from the way in which they stormed at me. I will never join in any more firework parties. It is a ridiculous waste of time and money."
"11 月7 日卢品让卡丽去登门拜访马特勒太太，可卡丽说她觉得马特勒太太应该先来拜访她。我觉得卡丽说得对，这引发了一场争论。不过卡丽说她一张名片也找不着了，我们必须得多印一些，等名片印好了，我们会有足够的时间讨论登门礼节，这样事情才算解决。","November 7.Lupin asked Carrie to call on Mrs. Mutlar, but Carrie said she thought Mrs. Mutlar ought to call on her first. I agreed with Carrie, and this led to an argument. However, the matter was settled by Carrie saying she could not find any visiting-cards, and we must get some more printed, and when they were finished would be quite time enough to discuss the etiquette of calling."
"11 月8 日我在布莱克文具店订做了些名片，每个人印了二十五张，够我们用一阵子了。晚上，卢品带来了马特勒小姐的弟弟哈里. 马特勒。小伙子长相很粗笨，卢品说他是俱乐部最好的、最受欢迎的业余演员，他指的是“霍洛韦喜剧演员会”。卢品还低声跟我们说，我们只要能让哈里“充分发挥”一下，他就能让我们捧腹大笑。","November 8.I ordered some of our cards at Black’s, the stationer’s. I ordered twenty-five of each, which will last us for a good long time. In the evening, Lupin brought in Harry Mutlar, Miss Mutlar’s brother. He was rather a gawky youth, and Lupin said he was the most popular and best amateur in the club, referring to the “Holloway Comedians.” Lupin whispered to us that if we could only “draw out” Harry a bit, he would make us roar with laughter."
"晚饭时候，小马特勒干了几件逗乐的事。他拿起一把刀，用刀背在脸上演奏了一曲，非常精彩。他还模仿没牙的老头儿抽大雪茄，雪茄不停地从嘴里掉出来，逗得卡丽一阵阵地大笑。","At supper, young Mutlar did several amusing things. He took up a knife, and with the flat part of it played a tune on his cheek in a wonderful manner. He also gave an imitation of an old man with no teeth, smoking a big cigar. The way he kept dropping the cigar sent Carrie into fits."
"谈话间，突然聊到了黛西，小马特勒说找个晚上他会带姐姐来我们家坐坐——他父母很守旧，不经常出门。卡丽说我们会安排一个特别的小聚会。快十一点的时候，小马特勒还没有走的意思，于是我就做了个小小的暗示，提醒卢品明天还得早起。可他并没听出我的意思，又开始了一连串的滑稽模仿，一小时都没停。可怜的卡丽困得都睁不开眼了，最后她终于找了个借口，说了声“晚安”。","In the course of conversation, Daisy’s name cropped up, and young Mutlar said he would bring his sister round to us one evening—his parents being rather old-fashioned, and not going out much. Carrie said we would get up a little special party. As young Mutlar showed no inclination to go, and it was approaching eleven o’clock, as a hint I reminded Lupin that he had to be up early to-morrow. Instead of taking the hint, Mutlar began a series of comic imitations. He went on for an hour without cessation. Poor Carrie could scarcely keep her eyes open. At last she made an excuse, and said “Good-night.”"
"后来马特勒走了，我听到他和卢品在厅里嘀咕“霍洛韦喜剧演员会”的事。而且让我生气的是，都半夜十二点多了，卢品竟还穿好衣服，戴上帽子，跟他的新伙伴出去了。","Mutlar then left, and I heard him and Lupin whispering in the hall something about the “Holloway Comedians,” and to my disgust, although it was past midnight, Lupin put on his hat and coat, and went out with his new companion."
"11 月9 日我努力想找出是谁撕了我几页日记，仍然无果。卢品满脑子是黛西. 马特勒，他除了吃饭时间准时出现外，我们很少能见到他。卡明斯来串门。","November 9.My endeavours to discover who tore the sheets out of my diary still fruitless. Lupin has Daisy Mutlar on the brain, so we see little of him, except that he invariably turns up at meal times. Cummings dropped in."
"11 月10 日卢品看起来喜欢他的新工作——真是个安慰。用茶点时，聊得全是黛西. 马特勒，卡丽几乎跟卢品一样，嘴上总挂着黛西。让我很生气的是，卢品告诉我他已经答应参加“霍洛韦喜剧演员会”近期的演出。他说在闹剧《去我叔叔家》中，他将扮演鲍勃. 布里奇，弗兰克. 马特勒扮演老玛斯特。我坦白告诉卢品，我对这事一点都不感兴趣，而且完全不赞同业余演员演戏。晚上，高英来串门。","November l0.Lupin seems to like his new berth—that’s a comfort. Daisy Mutlar the sole topic of conversation during tea. Carrie almost as full of it as Lupin. Lupin informs me, to my disgust, that he has been persuaded to take part in the forthcoming performance of the “Holloway Comedians.” He says he is to play Bob Britches in the farce, Gone to My Uncle’s; Frank Mutlar is going to play old Musty. I told Lupin pretty plainly I was not in the least degree interested in the matter, and totally disapproved of amateur theatricals. Gowing came in the evening."
"11 月11 日回到家，听着屋里吵吵嚷嚷，这很不光彩。卡丽看来是吓坏了，正站在卧室门外；而萨拉很激动，还哭着；比勒尔太太（打日工的女佣）明显喝酒了，正扯着嗓子喊叫:“我不是小偷，是个体面女人，我得靠自己努力工作来生活，谁要胡说，我就扇谁嘴巴子。”卢品背对着我，没听到我进来，他站在两个女人中间，努力想做个和事佬，遗憾的是，他当着他母亲的面讲粗话，我正好听到他说：“就为破日记里丢的几张纸，那破日记一磅都不值三便士半钱，吵成这德性。”我平静地说：“对不起，卢品，那是看法问题，既然我是一家之主，或许你应该让我来管这事。”","November 11.Returned home to find the house in a most disgraceful uproar. Carrie, who appeared very frightened, was standing outside her bedroom, while Sarah was excited and crying. Mrs. Birrell (the charwoman), who had evidently been drinking, was shouting at the top of her voice that “she was no thief, that she was a respectable woman, who had to work hard for her living, and she would smack anyone’s face who put lies into her mouth.” Lupin, whose back was towards me, did not hear me come in. He was standing between the two women, and, I regret to say, in his endeavour to act as peace maker, he made use of rather strong language in the presence of his mother; and I was just in time to hear him say: “And all this fuss about the loss of a few pages from a rotten diary that wouldn’t fetch three-halfpence a pound!” I said, quietly: “Pardon me, Lupin, that is a matter of opinion; and as I am master of this house, perhaps you will allow me to take the reins.”"
"我搞清了争吵的起因是萨拉指责比勒尔太太撕了我的几页日记，用来包她上周从厨房带走的肥肉和剩菜。比勒尔太太给了萨拉一耳光，说她“什么都没拿走，因为压根就没有剩菜”。我命令萨拉回去干活，让比勒尔太太回家。我进了客厅，卢品正在手舞足蹈，哈哈大笑。","I ascertained that the cause of the row was, that Sarah had accused Mrs. Birrell of tearing the pages out of my diary to wrap up some kitchen fat and leavings which she had taken out of the house last week. Mrs. Birrell had slapped Sarah’s face, and said she had taken nothing out of the place, as there was “never no leavings to take.” I ordered Sarah back to her work, and requested Mrs. Birrell to go home. When I entered the parlour Lupin was kicking his legs in the air, and roaring with laughter."
"11 月12 日 礼拜日从教堂回家的路上，我和卡丽碰上了卢品、黛西. 马特勒和她弟弟。卢品将黛西介绍给我们，然后我们一起步行回家，卡丽和马特勒小姐一起走着。我们邀请他们进家里坐会儿，我细细地瞅了一下未来的儿媳妇，心都凉了。她是个高个子的年轻女人，我觉得至少比卢品大八岁，而且也没觉得她漂亮。卡丽问她下周三能不能跟弟弟一起到家里来见几个朋友，她说她非常愿意。","November 12, Sunday.Coming home from church, Carrie and I met Lupin, Daisy Mutlar, and her brother. Daisy was introduced to us, and we walked home together, Carrie walking on with Miss Mutlar. We asked them in for a few minutes, and I had a good look at my future daughter-in-law. My heart quite sank. She is a big young woman, and I should think at least eight years older than Lupin. I did not even think her good-looking. Carrie asked her if she could come in on Wednesday next with her brother to meet a few friends. She replied that she would only be too pleased."
"11 月13 日卡丽给高英、卡明斯夫妇、萨顿的詹姆斯夫妇、斯蒂尔布鲁克先生发出了请帖。我给派克汉姆的弗朗清先生写了一封短信。卡丽说我们很可以办得漂亮点，为什么不邀请我们头儿波卡普先生？我说，恐怕对他来说我们的聚会不够档次，卡丽说“问问又没有错”。我说：“当然没有。”然后我给波卡普先生写了一封信。卡丽承认她对黛西. 马特勒的长相有点失望，但觉得她看起来是个不错的姑娘。","November 13.Carrie sent out invitations to Gowing, the Cummings’, to Mr. and Mrs. James (of Sutton), and Mr. Stillbrook. I wrote a note to Mr. Franching, of Peckham. Carrie said we may as well make it a nice affair, and why not ask our principal, Mr. Perkupp? I said I feared we were not quite grand enough for him. Carrie said there was “no offence in asking him.” I said: “Certainly not,” and I wrote him a letter. Carrie confessed she was a little disappointed with Daisy Mutlar’s appearance, but thought she seemed a nice girl."
"11 月14 日目前为止，大家都接受了我们的邀请，来参加明天相当重要的小聚会。波卡普先生写信说他那时会在肯辛顿吃饭，但要能走得开，就会来霍洛韦呆一小时。他的信写得很亲切，我会一直保存着。卡丽一天都忙着做小蛋糕、果酱泡芙和果冻，她说她要负责明晚的聚会，感觉很紧张。我们决定在桌上摆些小份食物，像三明治、冷鸡肉块和火腿，还有一些甜品，餐具柜上摆一份可口的冷牛肉和一份派桑杜口条，谁饿了愿意吃就吃。","November 14.Everybody so far has accepted for our quite grand little party for tomorrow. Mr. Perkupp, in a nice letter, which I shall keep, wrote that he was dining in Kensington, but if he could get away, he would come up to Holloway for an hour. Carrie was busy all day, making little cakes and open jam puffs and jellies. She said she felt quite nervous about her responsibilities to-morrow evening. We decided to have some light things on the table, such as sandwiches, cold chicken and ham, and some sweets, and on the sideboard a nice piece of cold beef and a Paysandu tongue for the more hungry ones to peg into if they liked."
"高英来问明天他要不要穿“燕尾服”，卡丽说最好穿上，主要是因为弗朗清先生要来，而且很有可能波卡普先生也会露面。","Gowing called to know if he was to put on “swallow-tails” tomorrow. Carrie said he had better dress, especially as Mr. Franching was coming, and there was a possibility of Mr. Perkupp also putting in an appearance."
"高英说：“哦，我只是想知道一下，因为我有一阵子没穿礼服了，得送去熨一下，把褶烫平。”","Gowing said: “Oh, I only wanted to know; for I have not worn my dress-coat for some time, and I must send it to have the creases pressed out.”"
"高英走了以后， 卢品回来了， 急着要讨好黛西. 马特勒，对安排挑挑拣拣，好一番批评，实际上他对什么都不满意，包括我们邀请老朋友卡明斯。他说卡明斯穿上晚礼服就像等待服务的菜贩子，要是黛西把他当成这样的人，他可一定不要惊讶。","After Gowing left, Lupin came in, and in his anxiety to please Daisy Mutlar, carped at and criticised the arrangements, and, in fact, disapproved of everything, including our having asked our old friend Cummings, who, he said, would look in evening-dress like a greengrocer engaged to wait, and who must not be surprised if Daisy took him for one."
"我忍无可忍，大发雷霆，说：“卢品，我告诉你，黛西. 马特勒小姐不是英国女王，我原本相信你够聪明，不至于上当，跟一个比自己大那么多的女人订婚。我建议你把自己和你老婆绑在一起之前先想想怎么挣钱吧，娶个老婆还得你养活，极有可能还得养活他弟弟，他看起来啥也不是，就是个游手好闲的主儿。”","I fairly lost my temper, and said: “Lupin, allow me to tell you Miss Daisy Mutlar is not the Queen of England. I gave you credit for more wisdom than to allow yourself to be inveigled into an engagement with a woman considerably older than yourself. I advise you to think of earning your living before entangling yourself with a wife whom you will have to support, and, in all probability, her brother also, who appeared to be nothing but a loafer.”"
"卢品没有明智地接受我的意见，反而跳起来说：“你侮辱跟我订了婚的女人就是在侮辱我，我要离开这个家，再也不登你的门。”","Instead of receiving this advice in a sensible manner, Lupin jumped up and said: “If you insult the lady I am engaged to, you insult me. I will leave the house and never darken your doors again.”"
"他甩门出去了。不过没事，他晚饭又回来吃了，还跟我们玩了伯齐克牌，一直玩到差不多十二点。","He went out of the house, slamming the hall-door. But it was all right. He came back to supper, and we played Bezique till nearly twelve o’clock."
"第九章","Chapter IX"
"我们第一次张罗重要聚会，来的既有老朋友也有新朋友。高英有点儿烦人；但他的朋友斯蒂尔布鲁克先生原来很风趣。波卡普先生来得不凑巧，可他特别友好，一直说好话。聚会圆满成功。","OUR FIRST IMPORTANT PARTY. OLD FRIENDS AND NEW FRIENDS. GOWING IS A LITTLE ANNOYING; BUT HIS FRIEND, MR. STILLBROOK, TURNS OUT TO BE QUITE AMUSING.INOPPORTUNE ARRIVAL OF MR. PERKUPP, BUT HE IS MOST KIND AND COMPLIMENTARY. PARTY A GREAT SUCCESS."
"11 月15 日喜庆的日子，我们搬家以来第一次张罗重要聚会。我很早就从市里回家了，卢品坚持雇了个服务员，还要了半打香槟。我觉得这笔开销没必要，可卢品说他走了点小运，在市里做了笔私人买卖，赚了三英镑。我希望他不要在新单位赌博。晚宴厅看着真漂亮，卡丽真切地说：“即便波卡普先生赏脸来了，看到晚宴厅，我们也不用觉得丢人了。”","November 15.A red letter day. Our first important party since we have been in this house. I got home early from the City. Lupin insisted on having a hired waiter, and stood a half-dozen of champagne. I think this an unnecessary expense, but Lupin said he had had a piece of luck, having made three pounds out of a private deal in the City. I hope he won’t gamble in his new situation. The supper-room looked so nice, and Carrie truly said: “We need not be ashamed of its being seen by Mr. Perkupp, should he honour us by coming.”"
"我早早就穿上礼服，以防大家八点钟准时到达。发现新礼服裤子太短了，很是恼火。卢品多管闲事，来挑我的刺儿，嫌我穿着普通靴子，没穿礼服靴。","I dressed early in case people should arrive punctually at eight o’clock, and was much vexed to find my new dress trousers much too short. Lupin, who is getting beyond his position, found fault with my wearing ordinary boots instead of dress-boots."
"我讽刺地回答：“我亲爱的儿子，我已经超脱于那种东西之上了。”","I replied satirically: “My dear son, I have lived to be above that sort of thing.”"
"卢品哈哈大笑起来说：“一般人都‘超过’自己的靴子。”","Lupin burst out laughing, and said: “A man generally was above his boots.”"
"这或许挺逗，或许不逗；但我很高兴，因为他没有发现我有一颗扣子上的珊瑚掉了。卡丽看起来像画上的人，穿着在市长官邸穿过的礼服。客厅装饰得棒极了，卡丽在折叠门上和一个进门处都挂了薄纱帘，因为我们已经把门从铰链处卸了下来。","This may be funny, or it may not; but I was gratified to find he had not discovered the coral had come off one of my studs. Carrie looked a picture, wearing the dress she wore at the Mansion House. The arrangement of the drawing-room was excellent. Carrie had hung muslin curtains over the folding-doors, and also over one of the entrances, for we had removed the door from its hinges."
"服务员彼得斯先生来得很准时，我给他下了严令，香槟一定得喝完一瓶再开另一瓶。卡丽安排在客厅餐具柜上摆了一些雪利酒和波尔图葡萄酒，还有一些玻璃杯。顺便说一句，我们那幅扩冲了的着色照片在墙上看起来很漂亮，特别是卡丽还在四个角上随意挂了些丝绸蝴蝶结。","Mr. Peters, the waiter, arrived in good time, and I gave him strict orders not to open another bottle of champagne until the previous one was empty. Carrie arranged for some sherry and port wine to be placed on the drawing-room sideboard, with some glasses. By the-by, our new enlarged and tinted photographs look very nice on the walls, especially as Carrie has arranged some Liberty silk bows on the four corners of them."
"第一个到的是高英，他以他一贯的风格，跟我打招呼：“喂，普特，你的裤子怎么这么短啊！”","The first arrival was Gowing, who, with his usual taste, greeted me with: “Hulloh, Pooter, why your trousers are too short!”"
"我只说了句：“很有可能，而且你会发现我脾气也很‘短’。”","I simply said: “ Very likely, and you will find my temper ‘short’ also.”"
"他说：“那也不会让裤子变长啊，笨蛋，你应该让你老婆在上面加个花边。”","He said: “That won’t make your trousers longer, Juggins. You should get your missus to put a flounce on them.”"
"我想我把他侮辱我的话写进日记里纯粹是浪费时间。","I wonder I waste my time entering his insulting observations in my diary."
"接下来到的是卡明斯夫妇。卡明斯先生说：“你没说穿礼服的事，所以我穿得‘半正式’来了。”他穿着黑色双排扣礼服，打着白色领带。詹姆斯夫妇、默顿先生，还有斯蒂尔布鲁克先生也来了，可卢品坐立不安、焦急难耐，直到他的黛西. 马特勒和弗兰克来了才没事。","The next arrivals were Mr. and Mrs. Cummings. The former said: “As you didn’t say anything about dress, I have come ‘half-dress.’” He had on a black frock-coat and white tie. The James’, Mr. Merton, and Mr. Stillbrook arrived, but Lupin was restless and unbearable till his Daisy Mutlar and Frank arrived."
"我和卡丽看到黛西的打扮吓了一跳，她穿了一件鲜亮的深红色低胸礼服，领口很低，我觉得这个样式很不庄重，她本该学学卡丽，用小蕾丝边儿将肩膀遮住。耐克斯先生、斯普莱斯. 霍格先生和他的四个女儿也来了；弗朗清也来了，还有卢品的一两个新朋友，都是“霍洛韦喜剧演员会”的成员，有的行为举止相当夸张，尤其有一个人，整个晚上都在摆造型，靠着我们的小圆桌，都把它压裂了。卢品叫他“我们的亨利”，说他是“霍洛韦喜剧演员会的台柱子”，跟哈里. 马特勒一样，低俗喜剧的商人演得相当不错。所有这些让我一头雾水。","Carrie and I were rather startled at Daisy’s appearance. She had a bright-crimson dress on, cut very low in the neck. I do not think such a style modest. She ought to have taken a lesson from Carrie, and covered her shoulders with a little lace. Mr. Nackles, Mr. Sprice-Hogg and his four daughters came; so did Franching, and one or two of Lupin’s new friends, members of the “Holloway Comedians.” Some of these seemed rather theatrical in their manner, especially one, who was posing all the evening, and leant on our little round table and cracked it. Lupin called him “our Henry,” and said he was “our lead at the H.C.’s,” and was quite as good in that department as Harry Mutlar was as the low -comedy merchant. All this is Greek to me."
"我们放了些音乐，卢品一刻都没离开过黛西，为黛西的歌声不断喝彩，她唱的是《某一天》，似乎是一首很好听的歌，可她唱得面部扭曲，我觉得还跑调得厉害，我本不该让她再唱了；可卢品让她一下子唱了四首歌，一首接着一首。","We had some music, and Lupin, who never left Daisy’s side for a moment, raved over her singing of a song, called “Some Day.” It seemed a pretty song, but she made such grimaces, and sang, to my mind, so out of tune, I would not have asked her to sing again; but Lupin made her sing four songs right off, one after the other."
"十点钟，我们下楼吃晚饭。从高英和卡明斯吃饭的样子看，你会觉得他们有一个月没吃饭了。我告诉卡丽留着点东西，万一波卡普先生偶然来了呢。高英倒了一大杯香槟，一口干了，这让我很恼火。他又这样喝了一杯，我怕半打酒都撑不到晚宴结束。我想收起来一瓶，可卢品夺过去，拿到靠墙的桌子上，那桌旁坐着黛西和弗兰克。","At ten o’clock we went down to supper, and from the way Gowing and Cummings ate you would have thought they had not had a meal for a month. I told Carrie to keep something back in case Mr. Perkupp should come by mere chance. Gowing annoyed me very much by filling a large tumbler of champagne, and drinking it straight off. He repeated this action, and made me fear our half-dozen of champagne would not last out. I tried to keep a bottle back, but Lupin got hold of it, and took it to the side-table with Daisy and Frank Mutlar."
"我们上楼了，年轻小伙子们开始胡闹，卡丽立刻制止了。斯蒂尔布鲁克唱了一支歌，名叫《你跟堂兄约翰干啥了？》，把我们逗乐了。我没注意到卢品和弗兰克不见了，我问沃森先生——也是“霍洛韦喜剧演员会”的——卢品和弗兰克在哪儿，他说：“这是个‘大惊喜’！”","We went upstairs, and the young fellows began skylarking. Carrie put a stop to that at once. Stillbrook amused us with a song, “What Have You Done With Your Cousin John?” I did not notice that Lupin and Frank had disappeared. I asked Mr. Watson, one of the Holloways, where they were, and he said: “It’s a case of ‘Oh, what a surprise!’ ”"
"沃森让我们围成一个圈，我们这样做了，然后沃森说：“我非常高兴给大家介绍著名的布隆丁. 驴。”接着弗兰克和卢品蹦进了屋子，卢品把脸涂白了，像个小丑，弗兰克腰上围了块大地毯，他扮的应该是驴，样子也像。小伙子们沉迷于闹剧中，我们都尖叫着，哈哈大笑。","We were directed to form a circle—which we did. Watson then said: “I have much pleasure in introducing the celebrated Blondin Donkey.” Frank and Lupin then bounded into the room. Lupin had whitened his face like a clown, and Frank had tied round his waist a large hearthrug. He was supposed to be the donkey, and he looked it. They indulged in a very noisy pantomime, and we were all shrieking with laughter."
"我突然转身，看到波卡普先生正站在门口，他来了我们都不知道。我向卡丽示意，然后我们两人很快一起来到波卡普先生跟前，他没有直接进屋。我为那愚蠢的表演而道歉，可波卡普先生说：“哦，这看起来很逗。”我能看出来，他一点都不觉得逗。","I turned round suddenly, and then I saw Mr. Perkupp standing halfway in the door, he having arrived without our knowing it. I beckoned to Carrie, and we went up to him at once. He would not come right into the room. I apologised for the foolery, but Mr. Perkupp said: “Oh, it seems amusing.” I could see he was not a bit amused."
"我和卡丽带他下楼，可桌子坏了，香槟一杯都没了——连三明治都没了。波卡普先生说他什么都不想吃，只想喝杯赛尔脱兹矿泉水或苏打水，可最后一个苏打水瓶子也空了。卡丽说：“我们还剩了很多波尔图葡萄酒。”波卡普先生微笑着说：“不喝了，谢谢，我真的什么都不要了，但我很高兴在您家里见到您和您的丈夫。晚安，普特太太——请原谅我只呆了这么一小会儿，我知道你们不会怪我的。”我跟他一起来到他的马车跟前，他说：“明天不用着急，十二点来公司就行了。”","Carrie and I took him downstairs, but the table was a wreck. There was not a glass of champagne left—not even a sandwich. Mr. Perkupp said he required nothing, but would like a glass of seltzer or soda water. The last syphon was empty. Carrie said: “We have plenty of port wine left.” Mr. Perkupp said, with a smile: “No, thank you. I really require nothing, but I am most pleased to see you and your husband in your own home. Good-night, Mrs. Pooter—you will excuse my very short stay, I know.” I went with him to his carriage, and he said: “Don’t trouble to come to the office till twelve to-morrow.”"
"回到屋里，我觉得很沮丧，告诉卡丽说我觉得聚会办砸了。卡丽说聚会很成功，只是我累了，坚持让我喝点波尔图葡萄酒。我喝了两杯，觉得好多了。我们一起到了客厅，他们已经开始跳舞了，我和卡丽也跳了一小会儿，我说这让我想起了过去的日子。她说我是个多愁善感的老家伙。","I felt despondent as I went back to the house, and I told Carrie I thought the party was a failure. Carrie said it was a great success, and I was only tired, and insisted on my having some port myself. I drank two glasses, and felt much better, and we went into the drawing-room, where they had commenced dancing. Carrie and I had a little dance, which I said reminded me of old days. She said I was a spooney old thing."
"第十章","Chapter X"
"反思。我又开了个不错的玩笑。上的菜总是“牛奶冻”，我很生气。卢品就婚礼发表了自己的看法。卢品跟黛西. 马特勒分手了。","REFLECTIONS. I MAKE ANOTHER GOOD JOKE. AM ANNOYED AT THE CONSTANT SERVING-UP OF THE “BLANC-MANGE.” LUPIN EXPRESSES HIS OPINION OF WEDDINGS. LUPIN FALLS OUT WITH DAISY MUTLAR."
"11 月16 日一晚上醒了大概有二十次，口很渴，瓶子里的水都喝光了，还喝了一半壶里的。还一直做梦，梦到昨晚的聚会办砸了，有很多下等人不请自到，不停地戏弄波卡普先生，还拿东西砸他，直到最后我不得不把他藏在储藏室（我们刚发现的）里，给他身上遮了块浴巾。现在看似很荒唐，可在梦里极其真切。同样的梦我做了很多次了。","November 16.Woke about twenty times during the night, with terrible thirst. Finished off all the water in the bottle, as well as half that in the jug. Kept dreaming, also, that last night’s party was a failure, and that a lot of low people came without invitation, and kept chaffing and throwing things at Mr. Perkupp, till at last I was obliged to hide him in the box-room (which we had just discovered), with a bath-towel over him. It seems absurd now, but it was painfully real in the dream. I had the same dream about a dozen times."
"卡丽的话让我很生气，她说：“你知道，你就不能喝香槟。”我告诉她，我只喝了两杯，还只是波尔图葡萄酒，还说好香槟不伤人，卢品告诉我说多亏是一个旅行者帮忙才买到的，因为这个特别的牌子已经被一家西区俱乐部收购了。","Carrie annoyed me by saying: “You know champagne never agrees with you.” I told her I had only a couple of glasses of it, having kept myself entirely to port. I added that good champagne hurt nobody, and Lupin told me he had only got it from a traveller as a favour, as that particular brand had been entirely bought up by a West-End club."
"我觉得我吃“配菜”（服务员这么叫的）吃得太开心了，我对卡丽说：“我多想把这些‘配菜’收起来啊。”又重复了一次，可卡丽只顾忙着收拾为了举办聚会从卡明斯夫人那里借的茶匙。刚好十一点半，我正准备去上班，卢品出现了，脸色发黄，他说：“喂！老爸，宝贵的脑袋今早感觉如何啊？”我告诉他还不如跟我讲荷兰语呢。他还说：“今早我醒来，脑袋像鲍德温气球那么大。”我立马说出了自认为有史以来说过的最聪明的话：“或许这能解释跳伞射击为什么会造成疼痛。”我们三个哈哈大笑。","I think I ate too heartily of the “side dishes,” as the waiter called them. I said to Carrie: “I wish I had put those ‘side dishes’ aside.” I repeated this, but Carrie was busy, packing up the teaspoons we had borrowed of Mrs. Cummings for the party. It was just half-past eleven, and I was starting for the office, when Lupin appeared, with a yellow complexion, and said: “Hulloh! Guv., what priced head have you this morning?” I told him he might just as well speak to me in Dutch. He added: “When I woke this morning, my head was as big as Baldwin’sballoon1.” On the spur of the moment I said the cleverest thing I think I have ever said; viz.: “Perhaps that accounts for the parashooting pains.” We all three roared."
"11 月17 日还是感觉累，头也痛！晚上，高英来串门，满口称赞我们上周三的聚会。他说一切都办得很漂亮，他过得相当愉快。高英要是自己愿意的话，可以表现得非常友好，可你从来不知道这能持续多久。比如说，他顺路来吃晚饭，看到桌子上有些牛奶冻，佣人还在屋里呢，他就大喊：“喂！周三剩下的吧？”","November 17.Still feel tired and headachy! In the evening Gowing called, and was full of praise about our party last Wednesday. He said everything was done beautifully, and he enjoyed himself enormously. Gowing can be a very nice fellow when he likes, but you never know how long it will last. For instance, he stopped to supper, and seeing some blanc-mange on the table, shouted out, while the servant was in the room: “Hulloh! The remains of Wednesday?”"
"11 月18 日一晚上睡得很好，醒来非常精神，感觉恢复过来了。我觉得出去应酬的生活不适合我，因此我们谢绝了参加伯德小姐婚礼的邀请，请帖是今早收到的。我们只在詹姆斯太太家见过她两次，而且要去就得随礼。卢品说：“这次我赞同你的做法，我觉得婚礼就是一出非常差劲的戏，戏中只有两个角色——新娘和新郎。伴郎只是个配角，除了一把鼻涕一把泪的父母以外，其他人都是跑龙套的，必须穿戴华丽，还得用昂贵的礼物来买这些无关紧要的角色。”我不喜欢用戏剧行话说事，但觉得这比喻挺巧妙，尽管有点失礼。","November 18.Woke up quite fresh after a good night’s rest, and feel quite myself again. I am satisfied a life of going-out and Society is not a life for me; we therefore declined the invitation which we received this morning to Miss Bird’s wedding. We only met her twice at Mrs. James’, and it means a present. Lupin said: “I am with you for once. To my mind a wedding’s a very poor play. There are only two parts in it—the bride and bridegroom. The best man is only a walking gentleman. With the exception of a crying father and a snivelling mother, the rest are supers who have to dress well and have to pay for their insignificant parts in the shape of costly presents.” I did not care for the theatrical slang, but thought it clever, though disrespectful."
"我告诉萨拉早餐不要再上牛奶冻了，好像自从周三以来，每顿饭桌上都有牛奶冻。卡明斯晚上来串门，祝贺我们聚会圆满成功。他说这是他这么多年参加过最好的聚会。可他说要是我们事先通知他是正式聚会，那他就穿燕尾服来了。我们坐着，安静地玩多米诺骨牌，被卢品和弗兰克. 马特勒吵闹的进门声打断了。我和卡明斯让他们也一起玩，卢品说他不喜欢多米诺骨牌，提议玩“说瞎话”游戏。我正要问是否需要筹码，弗兰克和卢品齐声说：“一、二、三，开始！你在格林兰有地产吗？”我一头雾水，不过看起来这是“霍洛韦喜剧演员会”的一个传统，每当一个会员表现出无知时，就玩这种游戏。","I told Sarah not to bring up the blanc-mange again for breakfast. It seems to have been placed on our table at every meal since Wednesday. Cummings came round in the evening, and congratulated us on the success of our party. He said it was the best party he had been to for many a year; but he wished we had let him know it was full dress, as he would have turned up in his swallow-tails. We sat down to a quiet game of dominoes, and were interrupted by the noisy entrance of Lupin and Frank Mutlar. Cummings and I asked them to join us. Lupin said he did not care for dominoes, and suggested a game of “Spoof”. On my asking if it required counters, Frank and Lupinin measured time said: “One, two, three; go! Have you an estate in Green land?” It was simply Greek to me, but it appears it is one of the customs of the “Holloway Comedians” to do this when a member displays ignorance."
"尽管我吩咐过萨拉，可晚饭又上了牛奶冻，更可恶的是她还要试图掩饰，把它放在玻璃盘子里，周围加了果酱。卡丽问卢品想不想来点儿，他回答说：“不要给我二手货，谢谢。”就剩我和卡丽两个人的时候，我告诉她，要是桌子上再有牛奶冻，我就出去，不在家里呆了。","In spite of my instructions, that blanc-mange was brought up again for supper. To make matters worse, there had been an attempt to disguise it, by placing it in a glass dish with jam round it. Carrie asked Lupin if he would have some, and he replied: “No second-hand goods for me, thank you.” I told Carrie, when we were alone, if that blanc-mange were placed on the table again， I should walk out of the house."
"11 月19 日 礼拜日快乐安静的一天。下午，卢品去跟马特勒一家呆着了。他兴致勃勃地离开了，卡丽说：“卢品跟黛西订婚的一个好处就是这孩子整天都看着很高兴。这多少给我点安慰，虽然我必须承认这婚定得有点草率。”","November 19, Sunday.A delightfully quiet day. In the afternoon Lupin was off to spend the rest of the day with the Mutlars. He departed in the best of spirits, and Carrie said: “Well, one advantage of Lupin’s engagement with Daisy is that the boy seems happy all day long. That quite reconciles me to what I must confess seems an imprudent engagement.”"
"我和卡丽一晚上都在讨论这个事，一致认为早订婚不一定就意味着婚姻不幸福。亲爱的卡丽提醒我，我们结婚就早，除了几次小误会以外，从没真正翻过脸。我不由自主地想（我也是这么告诉她的），生活的一半乐趣来自于小争执和小贫困，这是婚姻初期每个人都得承受的。这样的争执往往由沟通方式不妥当引起，而且通常有助于相爱的两口子感情更牢固。","Carrie and I talked the matter over during the evening, and agreed that it did not always follow that an early engagement meant an unhappy marriage. Dear Carrie reminded me that we married early, and, with the exception of a few trivial misunderstandings, we had never had a really serious word. I could not help thinking(as I told her) that half the pleasures of life were derived from the little struggles and small privations that one had to endure at the beginning of one’s married life. Such struggles were generally occasioned by want of means, and often helped to make loving couples stand together all the firmer."
"卡丽说我讲得相当不错，真是个哲人。","Carrie said I had expressed myself wonderfully well, and that I was quite a philosopher."
"我们有时候都会有虚荣心，我也必须承认，卡丽些微的赞扬让我沾沾自喜。我不会假装能用华丽的辞藻来表达想法，但觉得我有能力简单明了地说明自己的观点。","We are all vain at times, and I must confess I felt flattered by Carrie’s little compliment. I don’t pretend to be able to express myself in fine language, but I feel I have the power of expressing my thoughts with simplicity and lucidness."
"让我们惊讶的是，九点左右，卢品回来了，一脸愤怒、满不在乎的神情，用我觉得像演戏般空洞的声音说：“有白兰地吗？”我说：“没有，但给你点威士忌吧。”卢品喝下了将近一杯，也没加点水，把我吓坏了。","About nine o’clock, to our surprise, Lupin entered, with a wild, reckless look, and in a hollow voice, which I must say seemed rather theatrical, said: “Have you any brandy?” I said: “No; but here is some whisky.” Lupin drank off nearly a wineglassful without water, to my horror."
"我们三个都坐着看书，一句话不说，一直到十点，我和卡丽起身要去睡觉。卡丽对卢品说：“我想黛西还好吧？”","We all three sat reading in silence till ten, when Carrie and I rose to go to bed. Carrie said to Lupin: “I hope Daisy is well?”"
"卢品一脸佯装的不屑表情，一定是从“霍洛韦喜剧演员会”学的。他回答说：“噢，黛西？你是说马特勒小姐，我不知道她好不好，不过请永远不要再在我面前提她的名字。”","Lupin, with a forced careless air that he must have picked up from the “Holloway Comedians,” replied: “Oh, Daisy? You mean Miss Mutlar. I don’t know whether she is well or not, but please never to mention her name again in my presence.”"

"第十一章","Chapter XI "
"我们看了好几场模仿欧文的表演。认识了一位叫帕吉的先生，不喜欢他。博文. 福赛尔顿先生变得惹人烦。","WE HAVE A DOSE OF IRVING1 IMITATIONS. MAKE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF A MR. PADGE. DON’T CARE FOR HIM. MR. BURWIN-FOSSELTON BECOMES A NUISANCE."
"11 月20 日一整天都没见卢品的影子了。买了一本便宜的地址簿，花了一个晚上，把朋友和熟人的姓名和地址都抄在上面，当然没写马特勒家的人。","November 20.Have seen nothing of Lupin the whole day. Bought a cheap address-book. I spent the evening copying in the names and addresses of my friends and acquaintances. Left out the Mutlars of course."
"晚上，卢品露了几分钟面，他要一点白兰地，一脸无所谓的表情，在我看来，这表情很夸张，而且相当缺乏表现力。我说：“我的孩子，我没有白兰地，而且就算有，我想我也不会给你。”卢品说：“我去能喝到白兰地的地方。”说着便走出了家门。卡丽站在了孩子一边，晚上剩下的时间我们都在争论，非常不愉快，争论中无数次提到“黛西”和“马特勒”这两个词。","Lupin turned up for a few minutes in the evening. He asked for a drop of brandy with a sort of careless look, which to my mind was theatrical and quite ineffective. I said: “My boy, I have none, and I don’t think I should give it you if I had.” Lupin said: “I’ll go where I can get some,” and walked out of the house. Carrie took the boy’s part, and the rest of the evening was spent in a disagreeable discussion, in which the words “Daisy” and “Mutlar” must have occurred a thousand times."
"11 月22 日晚上，高英和卡明斯来串门，卢品也回来了，带着他的朋友博文. 福赛尔顿先生，“霍洛韦喜剧演员会”会员。那天晚上他也来参加我们的聚会了，还把我们的小圆桌弄裂了。幸运的是我们一个字也没提黛西. 马特勒，几乎就那年轻小伙子福赛尔顿一个人在那儿滔滔不绝。他不仅长得很像欧文，而且似乎他想象着自己就是那个著名演员，我得说他模仿欧文的几个表演都棒极了。晚饭时候，看他没有走的意思，于是我说：“福赛尔顿先生，要是您愿意，就留下来一起吃顿家常便饭吧。”他回答说：“好啊！谢谢；但请称呼我博文. 福赛尔顿，是个复姓，有很多姓福赛尔顿的，可请您叫我博文. 福赛尔顿。”","November 22.Gowing and Cummings dropped in during the evening. Lupin also came in, bringing his friend Mr. Burwin-Fosselton—one of the “Holloway Comedians”—who was at our party the other night, and who cracked our little round table. Happy to say Daisy Mutlar was never referred to. The conversation was almost entirely monopolized by the young fellow Fosselton, who not only looked rather like Mr. Irving, but seemed to imagine that he was the celebrated actor. I must say he gave some capital imitations of him. As he showed no signs of moving at supper time, I said: “If you like to stay, Mr. Fosselton, for our usual crust—pray do.” He replied: “Oh! thanks; but please call me Burwin-Fosselton. It is a double name. There are lots of Fosseltons, but please call me Burwin-Fosselton.”"
"晚饭的时候，他开始一直模仿欧文，整个身子低低地陷进椅子里，下巴几乎挨着饭桌了。他两次在桌下踢到了卡丽，打翻了酒，还拿刀子在高英脸旁比划，让人很不自在。晚饭后，他一直把腿伸到壁炉挡板上，乐此不疲地模仿戏剧中的段子，我是一点儿都不懂。他还不止一次打翻火炉用具，发出令人讨厌的噪音——可怜的卡丽本来就正犯着严重的头疼。","He began doing the Irving business all through supper. He sank so low down in his chair that his chin was almost on a level with the table, and twice he kicked Carrie under the table, upset his wine, and flashed a knife uncomfortably near Gowing’s face. After supper he kept stretching out his legs on the fender, indulging in scraps of quotations from plays which were Greek to me, and more than once knocked over the fire-irons, making a hideous row—poor Carrie already having a bad headache."
"让我们诧异的是，他告辞时说：“明天我再来，带上我演欧文的装扮。”高英和卡明斯说他们想来看看，明天也会再来。我不由地想，他们还不如在我家再办个聚会呢，反正看这架势他们也想。可就像卡丽说的：“亲爱的，能让卢品忘了黛西. 马特勒的事，干啥都行。”这很明智。","When he went, he said, to our surprise: “I will come to-morrow and bring my Irving make-up.” Gowing and Cummings said they would like to see it and would come too. I could not help thinking they might as well give a party at my house while they are about it. However, as Carrie sensibly said: “Do anything, dear, to make Lupin forget the Daisy Mutlar business.”"
"11 月23 日晚上，卡明斯来得很早，高英稍晚点，事先都没问问是否允许，就带来一个胖子，我觉得他长得很猥琐，名叫帕吉，看着满脸是胡子。高英一点都没有跟我或卡丽道歉的意思，只是说帕吉想看欧文模仿秀，帕吉听了说：“对，没错。”而整个晚上，他确实就只说了这一句话。卢品回来了，看上去精神好多了，还准备了一个小惊喜。博文. 福赛尔顿先生跟他一起进门，但上楼准备去了。半小时后，卢品离开客厅，几分钟后又回来了，大声宣布：“有请亨利. 欧文先生。”","November 23.In the evening, Cummings came early. Gowing came a little later and brought, without asking per mission, a fat and, I think, very vulgar-looking man named Padge, who appeared to be all moustache. Gowing never attempted any apology to either of us, but said Padge wanted to see the Irving business, to which Padge said: “That’s right,” and that is about all he did say during the entire evening. Lupin came in and seemed in much better spirits. He had prepared a bit of a surprise. Mr. Burwin-Fosselton had come in with him, but had gone upstairs to get ready. In half-an-hour Lupin retired from the parlour, and returning in a few minutes, announced “Mr. Henry Irving.”"
"我得说我们大家都惊呆了。我从来没见过扮得这么像的，太不可思议了。只有一个人看起来兴趣索然，那就是帕吉，他占了最好的扶手椅，叼着一杆脏兮兮的烟斗，朝壁炉里吐着烟。过了一小会儿，我说：“为什么演员总留着这么长的头发？”卡丽立马说：“黑尔先生就不留长发。”我们听了大笑，只有福赛尔顿先生不笑，他非常傲慢地说：“普特太太，这个笑话就算不是很新鲜，但也非常妥当。”我想这话是在斥责卡丽，于是说：“福赛尔顿先生，我想……”他打断我说：“请您称呼博文. 福赛尔顿先生。”这让我完全忘记了刚才想跟他说什么。晚饭时候，博文. 福赛尔顿先生又一个人滔滔不绝地模仿欧文，我和卡丽得出的结论是：就算是欧文模仿秀，也能让人看够了。晚饭后，博文. 福赛尔顿先生模仿欧文有点太闹腾了。他突然抓住高英的领子，大拇指的指甲抠进了高英脖子，给抠下来一块肉，当然他是无意的。高英当然被惹怒了，可帕吉那家伙，刚才怕舒服椅子给人占了，连饭都不吃；现在看到这个小意外，忍不住发出阵阵失控的笑声。帕吉的行为让我很生气，我说：“我看要是他把高英先生的眼睛抠出来，你也会笑？”帕吉回答说：“没错。”说完笑得更厉害了。我觉得或许最令人惊讶的是在我们散场时，博文. 福赛尔顿先生说：“晚安，普特先生，很高兴你们喜欢模仿表演，明晚我会带另一套装扮来","I must say we were all astounded. I never saw such a resemblance. It was astonishing. The only person who did not appear interested was the man Padge, who had got the best arm-chair, and was puffing away at a foul pipe into the fireplace. After some little time I said: “Why do actors always wear their hair so long?” Carrie in a moment said, “Mr. Hare2 doesn’t wear long hair.” How we laughed except Mr. Fosselton, who said, in a rather patronising kind of way, “The joke, Mrs. Pooter, is extremely appropriate, if not altogether new.” Thinking this rather a snub, I said: “Mr. Fosselton, I fancy—” He interrupted me by saying: “Mr. Burwin -Fosselton, if you please,” which made me quite forget what I was going to say to him. During the supper Mr. Burwin-Fosselton again monopolized the conversation with his Irving talk, and both Carrie and I came to the conclusion one can have even too much imitation of Irving. After supper, Mr. Burwin-Fosselton got a little too boisterous over his Irving imitation, and suddenly seizing Gowing by the collar of his coat, dug his thumb-nail, accidentally of course, into Gowing’s neck and took a piece of flesh out. Gowing was rightly annoyed, but that man Padge, who having declined our modest supper in order that he should not lose his comfortable chair, burst into an uncontrollable fit of laughter at the little misadventure. I was so annoyed at the conduct of Padge, I said: “I suppose you would have laughed if he had poked Mr. Gowing’s eye out?” to which Padge replied: “That’s right,” and laughed more than ever. I think perhaps the greatest surprise was when we broke up, for Mr. Burwin-Fosselton said: “Good-night, Mr. Pooter. I’m glad you like the imitation, I’ll bring the other make-up to-morrow night.”"
"11 月24 日我去市里没带手帕，上周我已经是第二次干这事了，一定是记忆力正在减退。要不是黛西. 马特勒这事儿，我会写信告诉博文. 福赛尔顿先生今晚我会出去，可我想象他这样的年轻人，不管怎样都会来的。","November 24.I went to town without a pocket-handkerchief. This is the second time I have done this during the last week. I must be losing my memory. Had it not been for this Daisy Mutlar business, I would have written to Mr. Burwin-Fosselton and told him I should be out this evening, but I fancy he is the sort of young man who would come all the same."
"亲爱的老卡明斯晚上来了，可高英送来张小纸条，说他希望我原谅他不能来，这让我觉得很好笑。他还说脖子还是有点疼。当然，博文. 福赛尔顿先生也来了，但卢品一直没露面。那个帕吉竟然又来了，甚至没有高英一道，能想象我有多反感吧。我有点怒了，说：“帕吉先生，真是没想到啊。”亲爱的卡丽，怕发生不愉快，说：“噢，我想帕吉先生只是来看另一套欧文装扮的。”帕吉说：“没错。”然后又占了最好的椅子，之后一晚上都没挪窝。","Dear old Cummings came in the evening; but Gowing sent round a little note, saying he hoped I would excuse his not turning up, which rather amused me. He added that his neck was still painful. Of course, Burwin-Fosselton came, but Lupin never turned up, and imagine my utter disgust when that man Padge actually came again, and not even accompanied by Gowing. I was exasperated, and said: “Mr. Padge, this is a surprise.” Dear Carrie fearing unpleasantness said: “Oh! I suppose Mr. Padge has only come to see the other Irving make-up.” Mr. Padge said, “That’s right,” and took the best chair again, from which he never moved the whole evening."
"唯一让我感到安慰的是，他不吃晚饭，所以招待他这样的客人不费什么钱，可我还是要跟高英说说这事。一晚上都是欧文模仿秀，要不就是关于欧文的对话，最后我都受不了了。有一阵儿我们进行了热烈的讨论，卡明斯起的头，他说他觉得博文. 福赛尔顿先生不仅长得像欧文，而且从他的判断看，一招一式表演得跟欧文一样好，甚至比欧文还好。我试探着说，毕竟这是对原版的模仿。","My only consolation is, he takes no supper, so he is not an expensive guest, but I shall speak to Gowing about the matter. The Irving imitations and conversations occupied the whole evening, till I was sick of it. Once we had a rather heated discussion, which was commenced by Cummings saying that it appeared to him that Mr. Burwin -Fosselton was not only like Mr. Irving, but was in his judgment every way as good or even better. I ventured to remark that after all it was but an imitation of an original."
"卡明斯肯定地说，有些模仿比原版还要好，我觉得我的话回得很巧妙：“没有原版，哪来模仿。”博文. 福赛尔顿先生很不礼貌地说：“请不要当着我的面讨论我；还有，普特先生，我建议你还是聊点自己懂的话题。”对此帕吉那家伙接话说：“没错。”亲爱的卡丽打破了尴尬的局面，突然说：“我来模仿一下埃伦. 特里。”亲爱的卡丽的模仿秀大家都不喜欢，可她很自然，而且还很风趣，争论时候的不愉快很快烟消云散了。他们离开的时候，我直截了当地跟博文. 福赛尔顿先生和帕吉先生说，明晚我们有事儿。","Cummings said surely some imitations were better than the originals. I made what I considered a very clever remark: “Without an original there can be no imitation.” Mr. Burwin-Fosselton said quite impertinently: “Don’t discuss me in my presence, if you please; and Mr. Pooter, I should advise you to talk about what you understand;” to which that cad Padge replied: “That’s right.” Dear Carrie saved the whole thing by suddenly saying: “I’ll be EllenTerry3.” Dear Carrie’s imitation wasn’t a bit liked, but she was so spontaneous and so funny that the disagreeable discussion passed off. When they left, I very pointedly said to Mr. Burwin-Fosselton and Mr. Padge that we should be engaged to-morrow evening."
"11 月25 日收到福赛尔顿先生的一封长信，说到昨晚关于欧文的讨论，我非常生气，回信说我对戏剧那些东西懂得很少，或者说一点儿都不懂，也根本不感兴趣，坚决拒绝参与这个话题的讨论，哪怕要冒着友谊破裂的危险。我从来没写过这么斩钉截铁的信。","November 25.Had a long letter from Mr. Fosselton respecting last night’s Irving discussion. I was very angry, and I wrote and said I knew little or nothing about stage matters, was not in the least interested in them and positively declined to be drawn into a discussion on the subject, even at the risk of its leading to a breach of friendship. I never wrote a more determined letter."
"礼拜六下午，跟往常时间一样到家，在拱门附近碰上了黛西. 马特勒，我的心跳加速，僵硬地鞠了个躬，可她装着没看见我。晚上，洗衣女工送来的袜子有一只落单了，我很恼火。萨拉说她送去两双，洗衣女工说只送去一双半。我跟卡丽说这事，她非常烦躁地回答：“我厌烦了跟她说话，你最好亲自去跟她说，她就在外面。”我出去跟洗衣女工说了，可她口口声声说送去的时候就是单只。","On returning home at the usual hour on Saturday afternoon I met near the Archway Daisy Mutlar. My heart gave a leap. I bowed rather stiffly, but she affected not to have seen me. Very much annoyed in the evening by the laundress sending home an odd sock. Sarah said she sent two pairs, and the laundress declared only a pair and a half were sent. I spoke to Carrie about it, but she rather testily replied: “I am tired of speaking to her; you had better go and speak to her yourself. She is outside.” I did so, but the laundress declared that only an odd sock was sent."
"这时，高英进了走廊，听到这样的对话就够无礼的了，还插话说：“老兄，单只袜子别浪费了呀；行个好，送给某个只有一条腿的可怜家伙吧。”洗衣女工像个白痴一样傻笑，我很反感，就上楼了，去钉衣领，因为衬衫后背的扣子掉了。","Gowing passed into the passage at this time and was rude enough to listen to the conversation, and interrupting, said: “Don’t waste the odd sock old man; do an act of charity and give it to some poor man with only one leg.” The laundress giggled like an idiot. I was disgusted and walked upstairs for the purpose of pinning down my collar, as the button had come off the back of my shirt."
"我回到客厅，高英正在讲关于单只袜子的白痴笑话，卡丽哈哈大笑，我想我失去幽默感了。我坦率地说出对帕吉的看法，高英说，那晚之前，他也只见过帕吉一面，是一个朋友介绍的，因为他（帕吉）“请”吃了一顿，很不错，高英想回敬一下。听了我的话，高英的冷静让人难以置信。我正要接话，卢品进来了，不幸的是高英问起了黛西. 马特勒，卢品大叫：“管好您自己的事儿吧，先生！”然后冲出房间，摔门而去。这晚余下的时间里，说的全是黛西. 马特勒——黛西. 马特勒——黛西. 马特勒。哦，我的天啊！","When I returned to the parlour, Gowing was retailing his idiotic joke about the odd sock, and Carrie was roaring with laughter. I suppose I am losing my sense of humour. I spoke my mind pretty freely about Padge. Gowing said he had met him only once before that evening. He had been introduced by a friend, and as he (Padge) had “stood” a good dinner, Gowing wished to show him some little return. Upon my word, Gowing’s coolness surpasses all belief. Lupin came in before I could reply, and Gowing unfortunately inquired after Daisy Mutlar. Lupin shouted: “Mind your own business, sir!” and bounced out of the room, slamming the door. The remainder of the night was Daisy Mutlar —Daisy Mutlar—Daisy Mutlar. Oh dear!"
"11 月26 日 礼拜日今天，牧师的布道很精彩——的确非常精彩，虽然他的外表永远都不如我们亲爱的老牧师那样让人印象深刻，但我得说，他的布道却更让人难忘。今天发生了一件相当恼火的事儿，我得提一下。弗恩罗丝太太是一位贵妇人，住在卡姆登路的一所大房子里。做完礼拜，我们都正从教堂里往外走，她停下来跟我说话。我得说我感到受宠若惊，因为她声名显赫。我猜，她看到我经常端着募捐的盘子转，尤其她总坐在长椅靠角落的位置，这样她就认识我了。她是个有影响力的女士，可能有很重要的话要说。可不幸的是，她正要开口，一阵大风刮过来，将我帽子吹掉了，吹到了马路中央。","November 26, Sunday.The curate preached a very good sermon to-day—very good indeed. His appearance is never so impressive as our dear old vicar’s, but I am bound to say his sermons are much more impressive. A rather annoying incident occurred, of which I must make mention. Mrs. Fernlosse, who is quite a grand lady, living in one of those large houses in the Camden Road, stopped to speak to me after church, when we were all coming out. I must say I felt flattered, for she is thought a good deal of. I suppose she knew me through seeing me so often take round the plate, especially as she always occupies the corner seat of the pew. She is a very influential lady, and may have had something of the utmost importance to say, but unfortunately, as she commenced to speak a strong gust of wind came and blew my hat off into the middle of the road."
"我不得不去追帽子，费了很大的劲才捡回来，回来后，发现弗恩罗丝太太已经跟一些上流社会的朋友一起往前走了，我觉得现在不可能再接近她了，特别是我的帽子上已经沾满了泥巴。我说不出有多失望。","I had to run after it, and had the greatest difficulty in recovering it. When I had succeeded in doing, so I found Mrs. Fernlosse had walked on with some swell friends, and I felt I could not well approach her now, especially as my hat was smothered with mud. I cannot say how disappointed I felt."
"晚上（这可是礼拜日的晚上），我发现了博文. 福赛尔顿写来的一封短信，言辞无礼。信中这样写道：","In the evening (Sunday evening of all others) I found an impertinent note from Mr. Burwin-Fosselton, which ran as follows:"
"亲爱的普特先生：尽管您可能长我二三十岁——这有充分的理由证明，在这个微缩世界中，您应该有更丰富的阅历和资本——但我想很有可能，您生活的车轮不像写下这些文字、地位卑微的人的生活车轮那样，转得如此之快。过去一流的马可以超过慢马车，这已广为人知。","“Dear Mr. Pooter,—Although your junior by perhaps some twenty or thirty years—which is sufficient reason that you ought to have a longer record of the things and ways in this miniature of a planet—I feel it is just within the bounds of possibility that the wheels of your life don’t travel so quickly round as those of the humble writer of these lines. The dandy horse of past days has been known to overtake the slow coach."
"我说清楚了吗？","“Do I make myself understood?"
"那非常好！普特先生，请允许我建议您接受“聪明人会举一反三”这种说法。认输吧，优雅地接受惩罚；因为请记住是您丢掉手套认输的，无论是在脑力上或体力上我都不能承认自己是个懦夫！","“Very well, then! Permit me, Mr. Pooter, to advise you to accept the verb. sap.

"我发誓要登上名誉的阶梯。我或许会爬，或许会滑，亦或许会蹒跚踉跄（我们都很软弱），可我一定会登上我向往的阶梯顶端的！！！在那里，大家都能听到我的声音，因为我会朝下面的人群喊：“我征服了！”现在我只是个业余演员，的确，除了一群朋友之外，我的作品不为人知，还到处树敌。","“I have registered a vow to mount the steps of fame. I may craw3,I may slip, I may even falter (we are all weak), but reach the top rung of the ladder I will!!! When there, my voice shall be heard, for I will shout to the multitudes below: ‘Vici!’ For the present I am only an amateur, and my work is unknown, forsooth, save to a party of friends, with here and there an enemy."
"可普特先生，让我问问您：“业余的和专业的差别在哪儿？”","“But, Mr. Pooter, let me ask you, ‘What is the difference between the amateur and the professional?’"
"根本没有差别！！！","“None! ! !"
"等等！对，有一个差别，一个表演赚钱，另一个表演同样娴熟，却不赚钱","“Stay! Yes, there is a difference. One is paid for doing what the other does as skillfully for nothing!"
"但我也会赚钱的，因为我违背了家人和朋友的意愿，最后选择了舞台作为我的职业。当人们对滑稽剧的狂热平息以后——注意，很快就会这样——我会让大家知道我的能耐；因为我觉得——原谅我狂妄的表现——世上没有人能像我一样感觉到而且明白自己能演好驼背理查德。","“But I will be paid, too! For I, contrary to the wishes of my family and friends, have at last elected to adopt the stage as my profession. And when the farce craze is over—and, mark you, that will be soon—I will make my power known ; for I feel—pardon my apparent conceit—that there is no living man who can play the hump-backed Richard as I feel and know I can."
"而且您会第一个过来，低头降服。有很多事情，您可能都了解，但表演艺术，对您而言可是未知数.","And you will be the first to come round and bend your head in submission. There are many matters you may understand, but knowledge of the fine art of acting is to you an unknown quantity."
"恳请讨论随着这封信打住吧。再会！","“Pray let this discussion cease with this letter. Vale!"

"我收到一张侮辱我的圣诞卡。我们在卡丽妈妈那里过了一个愉快的圣诞节。有一位莫斯先生过于随便。一个喧闹的夜晚，黑暗中我被袭击了。我收到老马特勒先生的一封特别来信，是关于卢品的。我们错过了举杯辞旧岁。","I RECEIVE AN INSULTING CHRISTMAS CARD. WE SPEND A PLEASANT CHRISTMAS AT CARRIE’S MOTHER’S. A MR. MOSS IS RATHER TOO FREE. A BOISTEROUS EVENING, DURING WHICH I AM STRUCK IN THE DARK. I RECEIVE AN EXTRAORDINARY LETTER FROM MR. MUTLAR, SENIOR, RESPECTING LUPIN. WE MISS DRINKING OUT THE OLD YEAR."
"12 月24 日今早收到了一张侮辱我的圣诞卡，我虽是个穷人，但愿意出十先令查出是谁寄的。我从来没有侮辱过别人，为什么他们要侮辱我？这件事最糟糕的是，我发现自己在怀疑每个朋友。信封上的笔迹明显是伪装的，倾斜的方向都不对。我觉得高英或卡明斯不会干这种龌龊事，卢品说他一点都不知道，我也相信他，不过我不满他笑我，而且还同情那个使坏的人。弗朗清先生应该不屑于干这种勾当；我觉得马特勒家的人也不会降低身份干这事。我怀疑皮特，就是公司那个无礼的职员，是不是他干的呢？要不就是比勒尔太太，那个打日工的女佣，或者是博文. 福赛尔顿？比勒尔太太可写不出那么好的字。","December 24.I am a poor man, but I would gladly give ten shillings to find out who sent me the insulting Christmas card I received this morning. I never insult people; why should they insult me? The worst part of the transaction is, that I find myself suspecting all my friends. The handwriting on the envelope is evidently disguised, being written sloping the wrong way. I cannot think either Gowing or Cummings would do such a mean thing. Lupin denied all knowledge of it, and I believe him; although I disapprove of his laughing and sympathising with the offender. Mr. Franching would be above such an act; and I don’t think any of the Mutlars would descend to such a course. I wonder if Pitt, that impudent clerk at the office, did it? Or Mrs. Birrell, the charwoman, or Burwin-Fosselton? The writing is too good for the former."
"圣诞节我们在帕丁顿搭10：20 的火车去卡丽母亲家，在那里度过了愉快的一天。乡下很美、很舒服，只是路有点泥泞。中午，我们聚餐，只有十个人，大家聊着过去的时光。要是每个人都跟我一样，有一个和蔼、不爱管闲事的丈母娘，这个世界该会多么美好啊。趁着大家都情绪高昂，我提议为丈母娘的健康干杯，还讲了几句，我觉得非常精彩。","Christmas DayWe caught the 10.20 train at Paddington, and spent a pleasant day at Carrie’s mother’s. The country was quite nice and pleasant, although the roads were sloppy. We dined in the middle of the day, just ten of us, and talked over old times. If everybody had a nice, uninterfering mother-in-law, such as I have, what a deal of happiness there would be in the world. Being all in good spirits, I proposed her health; and I made, I think, a very good speech."
"我做了个很简洁的收尾， 说：“ 在这样一个时刻——无论亲戚、朋友，还是熟人——我们都怀着对彼此美好的感情，拥有共同的信念，心里装的只有爱和友谊。那些曾和朋友吵过架，而朋友又不在场的，该亲亲他们，重归于好吧；那些幸好没有闹过不愉快的，同样可以亲吻一下。”","I concluded, rather neatly, by saying: “On an occasion like this—whether relatives, friends, or acquaintances,—we are all inspired with good feelings towards each other. We are of one mind, and think only of love and friendship. Those who have quarrelled with absent friends should kiss and make it up. Those who happily have not fallen out, can kiss all the same.”"
"我看到卡丽和她妈妈眼中都噙着泪水，我得说，这样的赞美让我感到非常荣幸。那位敬爱的老牧师约翰. 潘西. 史密斯，曾给我们主持过婚礼。他说了几句，既愉快，又风趣，还说他应该响应我的号召，采取行动，他指的是亲吻。然后，他绕着桌子走了一圈，亲吻了每位女士，包括卡丽。当然谁都不会反对。可让我极其惊诧的是，有个叫莫斯的年轻人，我不认识他，他吃饭期间几乎都没说过一句话，突然拿着一枝槲寄生跳起来，大叫：“呦吼！我不明白为什么我不加入大家的行动中。”大家还没意识过来他要干什么，他就亲吻了卡丽和其他女士们。","I saw the tears in the eyes of both Carrie and her mother, and must say I felt very flattered by the compliment. That dear old Reverend John Panzy Smith, who married us, made a most cheerful and amusing speech, and said he should act on my suggestion respecting the kissing. He then walked round the table and kissed all the ladies, including Carrie. Of course one did not object to this; but I was more than staggered when a young fellow named Moss, who was a stranger to me, and who had scarcely spoken a word through dinner, jumped up suddenly with a sprig of misletoe, and exclaimed: “Hulloh! I don’t see why I shouldn’t be on in this scene.” Before one could realise what he was about to do, he kissed Carrie and the rest of the ladies."
"幸好大家都把这事当笑话，我们都笑了，可这是很危险的试验，这结果让我好一阵子都感觉非常不舒服。后来，我跟卡丽提到这事，可她说：“噢，他不过是个小男孩。”我说小男孩还长那么多胡子。卡丽回答：“我没说他不是个好男孩。”","Fortunately the matter was treated as a joke, and we all laughed, but it was a dangerous experiment, and I felt very uneasy for a moment as to the result. I subsequently referred to the matter to Carrie, but she said: “Oh, he’s not much more than a boy.” I said that he had a very large moustache for a boy. Carrie replied: “I didn’t say he was not a nice boy.”"
"12 月26 日我昨晚没睡好；我在陌生的床上总睡不好。我感觉有点消化不良，每年这个时侯，大家都会这样。晚上，我和卡丽回到城里，卢品很晚才回来，他说圣诞节他过得很快乐，还说：“我感觉像劳瑟拱廊小提琴那样好，而且只需再添点‘钱’，就会感觉跟500 英镑的斯特拉迪瓦里提琴那样好。”我早就不试着去理解卢品的俚语了，也不让他解释。","December 26.I did not sleep very well last night; I never do in a strange bed. I feel a little indigestion, which one must expect at this time of the year. Carrie and I returned to Town in the evening. Lupin came in late. He said he enjoyed his Christmas, and added: “I feel as fit as a Lowther Arcade fiddle, and only require a little more ‘oof’ to feel as fit as a £500 Stradivarius.” I have long since given up trying to understand Lupin’s slang, or asking him to explain it."
"12 月27 日我告诉卢品，明晚，我想让高英和卡明斯来串门，安静地玩会儿。我希望这孩子能主动留下来，帮着逗他们开心，可他说：“哦，你最好叫他们延期再来，因为我已经让黛西和弗兰克. 马特勒来了。”我说，我不打算那么做。卢品说：“那我发封电报，让黛西改天再来。”我建议说寄张明信片或寄封信也够快的，而且没那么浪费。","December 27.I told Lupin I was expecting Gowing and Cummings to drop in to-morrow evening for a quiet game. I was in hope the boy would volunteer to stay in, and help to amuse them. Instead of which, he said: “Oh, you had better put them off, as I have asked Daisy and Frank Mutlar to come.” I said I could not think of doing such a thing. Lupin said: “Then I will send a wire, and put off Daisy.” I suggested that a post-card or letter would reach her quite soon enough, and would not be so extravagant."
"卡丽听了我们的谈话，显然很生气，矛头直指卢品，她说：“卢品，为什么你反对黛西见你爸爸的朋友？是因为他们不够好，不配见她，还是她不够好，不配见他们？（这也同样有可能）。”卢品愣在那儿，无言以对。他离开房间后，我亲了一下卡丽，以表赞许。","Carrie, who had listened to the above conversation with apparent annoyance, directed a well-aimed shaft at Lupin. She said: “Lupin, why do you object to Daisy meeting your father’s friends? Is it because they are not good enough for her, or (which is equally possible) she is not good enough for them?” Lupin was dumbfounded, and could make no reply. When he left the room, I gave Carrie a kiss of approval."
"12 月28 日卢品一下来吃早饭就对他妈妈说：“我没有让黛西和弗兰克改日再来，今晚想让他们跟高英和卡明斯一起玩儿。”这话让我还挺满意的。卡丽回答说：“很高兴你能及时告诉我，这样我就可以把冷羊腿翻一下，再加上点欧芹打扮打扮，就没人会知道那是已经切过的了。”她还说要做点奶冻，再炖点苹果，到晚上就能凉了。","December 28.Lupin, on coming down to break fast, said to his mother: “I have not put off Daisy and Frank, and should like them to join Gowing and Cummings this evening.” I felt very pleased with the boy for this. Carrie said, in reply: “I am glad you let me know in time, as I can turn over the cold leg of mutton, dress it with a little parsley, and no one will know it has been cut.” She further said she would make a few custards, and stew some pippins, so that they would be cold by the evening."
"我发现卢品心情不错，于是暗地里问他，他个人是不是对高英或卡明斯有什么意见。他回答说：“一点也不，虽然我觉得卡明斯看着像头笨驴，但那部分是因为他光顾那‘三先令六便士统一价的帽子公司’，还有穿件二手长大衣。至于高英，永远穿着棕色棉绒夹克——哎呀，他真像个走街串巷照相的。”","Finding Lupin in good spirits, I asked him quietly if he really had any personal objection to either Gowing or Cummings. He replied: “Not in the least. I think Cummings looks rather an ass, but that is partly due to his patronising ‘the three-and-six-one-price hat company,’ and wearing a reach-me-down frock-coat. As for that perpetual brown velveteen jacket of Gowing’s—why, he resembles an itinerant photographer.”"
"我说体面人不在于衣着，卢品听了笑着回答说：“是啊，自己做衣服的人也算不上体面人。”","I said it was not the coat that made the gentleman; whereupon Lupin, with a laugh, replied: “No, and it wasn’t much of a gentleman who made their coats.”"
"晚饭吃得非常愉快， 黛西表现得很随和， 尤其是晚上刚开始那会儿， 她还唱了歌。可吃晚饭时， 她说：“ 你们会用面包做陀螺吗？” 说着她开始卷面包片，还在桌子上捻来捻去。我觉得这很不雅，可当然没说什么。过了一会儿，黛西和卢品开始互相扔面包丸，这让我很反感。弗兰克也跟着扔起来。卡明斯和高英也开始了，这让我很惊讶。后来他们又开始扔硬面包皮，有一片打到了我的前额上，弄得我直眨眼睛。我说：“请安静，安静！”弗兰克跳起来说：“当，当，乐队开始演奏。”","We were rather jolly at supper, and Daisy made herself very agreeable, especially in the earlier part of the evening, when she sang. At supper, however, she said: “Can you make tee-to-tums with bread?” and she commenced rolling up pieces of bread, and twisting them round on the table. I felt this to be bad manners, but of course said nothing. Presently Daisy and Lupin, to my disgust, began throwing bread-pills at each other. Frank followed suit, and so did Cummings and Gowing, to my astonishment. They then commenced throwing hard pieces of crust, one piece catching me on the forehead, and making me blink. I said: “Steady, please; steady!” Frank jumped up and said: “Tum, tum; then the band played.”"
"我不知道这是什么意思，可他们都大喊着，继续打面包仗。高英突然抓起冷羊肉里的欧芹，一股脑扔到我脸上，我愤怒地瞅着高英，他说：“我说，装着生气也没用，头上全是欧芹。”我起身，坚持要求别胡闹了，马上。弗兰克. 马特勒大喊：“时间，先生们，请注意时间！”然后关掉了煤气灯。我们被晾在那，周围漆黑一片。","I did not know what this meant, but they all roared, and continued the bread-battle. Gowing suddenly seized all the parsley off the cold mutton, and threw it full in my face. I looked daggers at Gowing, who replied: “I say, it’s no good trying to look indignant, with your hair full of parsley.” I rose from the table, and insisted that a stop should be put to this foolery at once. Frank Mutlar shouted: “Time, gentlemen, please! Time!” and turned out the gas, leaving us in absolute darkness."
"我摸索着往外走，后脑勺上突然挨了一下，出手挺重，是故意的。我大声说：“谁干的？”没人回答，于是我又问了一遍，还是没人回答。我划了根火柴，点亮了煤气灯，他们都有说有笑的，所以我没再追究这事。可他们走了以后，我对卡丽说：“圣诞节给我寄侮辱卡片的那个人今晚就在咱家。”","I was feeling my way out of the room, when I suddenly received a hard intentional punch at the back of my head. I said, loudly: “Who did that?” There was no answer; so I repeated the question, with the same result. I struck a match, and lighted the gas. They were all talking and laughing, so I kept my own counsel; but, after they had gone, I said to Carrie: “The person who sent me that insulting post-card at Christmas was here to-night.”"
"12 月29 日昨晚，我做了一个很逼真的梦。我醒了，可刚一睡着，恰恰又做了同样的梦。我梦到我听见弗兰克. 马特勒告诉他姐姐，他不仅给我寄了侮辱性的圣诞卡，而且承认昨晚是他摸黑敲了我的脑袋。事情就这么赶巧，卢品刚刚收到弗兰克的信，吃早饭的时候还给我们读了几段。","December 29.I had a most vivid dream last night. I woke up, and on falling asleep, dreamed the same dream over again precisely. I dreamt I heard Frank Mutlar telling his sister that he had not only sent me the insulting Christmas card, but admitted that he was the one who punched my head last night in the dark. As fate would have it, Lupin, at breakfast, was reading extracts from a letter he had just received from Frank."
"我让他把信封递过来，我好对对笔迹。他递给我，我把它跟装圣诞卡的信封比了一下，发现笔迹相似，尽管极力想掩饰。我把它们递给卡丽，她笑起来，我问她笑什么，她说这卡片根本就不是寄给我的，上面写的是“L. 普特”，不是“C. 普特”。卢品要看看收件人地址和卡片，然后笑着大叫：“噢，对，老爸，这本是给我的。”我说：“你习惯收侮辱人的圣诞卡？”他回答说：“噢，对，也有寄的习惯。”","I asked him to pass the envelope, that I might compare the writing. He did so, and I examined it by the side of the envelope containing the Christmas card. I detected a similarity in the writing, in spite of the attempted disguise. I passed them on to Carrie, who began to laugh. I asked her what she was laughing at, and she said the card was never directed to me at all. It was “L. Pooter,” not “C. Pooter.” Lupin asked to look at the direction and the card, and exclaimed, with a laugh: “Oh yes, Gov., it’s meant for me.” I said: “Are you in the habit of receiving insulting Christmas cards?” He replied: “Oh yes, and of sending them, too.”"
"晚上，高英来串门，说昨晚过得很开心。我当他是老朋友，趁机跟他说了昨晚恶意敲我脑袋那事。他突然笑起来，说：“噢，是你的脑袋啊，是吗？我知道我无意中打到了什么东西，可我还以为是砖墙呢。”我告诉他，我感觉受伤了, 这“受伤”可包括了它的两个意思。","In the evening Gowing called, and said he enjoyed himself very much last night. I took the opportunity to confide in him, as an old friend, about the vicious punch last night. He burst out laughing, and said: “Oh, it was your head, was it? I know I accidentally hit something, but I thought it was a brick wall.” I told him I felt hurt, in both senses of the expression."
"12 月30 日 礼拜日卢品一天都呆在马特勒家，晚上，他好像很高兴，因此我说：“卢品，看到你这么高兴，我也开心。”他回答说：“哦，黛西是个很出色的女孩，可我得杀杀她那笨老爸的威风。他很小气，舍不得给人雪茄，也舍不得让人喝酒，一分一厘都很节约，只离开房间一秒钟也得把煤气灯关了，用半张便条纸给人写信，把剩下的肥皂块粘到新肥皂上，壁炉两边各放两块砖，坐公车通常把身体悬在外面，这样只花半便士：他的这些做法逼得我多少得让他了解一下我的看法。”我说：“卢品，你不过是个孩子；我希望你不要后悔。”","December 30, Sunday.Lupin spent the whole day with the Mutlars. He seemed rather cheerful in the evening, so I said: “I’m glad to see you so happy, Lupin.” He answered: “Well, Daisy is a splendid girl, but I was obliged to take her old fool of a father down a peg. What with his meanness over his cigars, his stinginess over his drinks, his farthing economy in turning down the gas if you only quit the room for a second, writing to one on half -sheets of note-paper, sticking the remnant of the last cake of soap on to the new cake, putting two bricks on each side of the fireplace, and his general ‘outside-halfpenny-’bus-ness,’ I was compelled to let him have a bit of my mind.” I said: “Lupin, you are not much more than a boy; I hope you won’t repent it.”"
"12 月31 日旧年的最后一天，我收到老马特勒先生的一封特别来信。他写道：“亲爱的先生，我一度很难定夺这个重要问题：‘谁是我自己家的主人，是我，还是您儿子卢品？’相信我，对任何一边我都没有偏见；可是形势所迫，我不得不做出这样的判断：我才是我家的主人。这样，我有责任禁止您儿子再次踏进我家门。我很遗憾，因为这样让我不能跟有幸认识的某位最低调、最谦虚、最有绅士风度的人交往了。”","December 31.The last day of the Old Year. I received an extraordinary letter from Mr. Mutlar, senior. He writes: “Dear Sir,—For a long time past I have had considerable difficulty deciding the important question, ‘Who is the master of my own house? Myself, or your son Lupin?’ Believe me, I have no prejudice one way or the other; but I have been most reluctantly compelled to give judgment to the effect that I am the master of it. Under the circumstances, it has become my duty to forbid your son to enter my house again.’ I am sorry, because it deprives me of the society of one of the most modest, unassuming, and gentlemanly persons I have ever had the honour of being acquainted with.”"
"我不想让最后一天过得不愉快，因此没跟卡丽和卢品说信的事。","I did not desire the last day to wind up disagreeably, so I said nothing to either Carrie or Lupin about the letter."
"雾气浓得很可怕，卢品还要出去，但答应回来举杯辞旧岁——我们一直遵守的习俗。差一刻十二点了，卢品还没有回来，雾大得吓人。因为新年临近，我便拿出了烈酒。我和卡丽决定喝点威士忌，因此我新开了一瓶；可卡丽说闻着像白兰地。因为我知道那是威士忌，所以说没什么好讨论的。卢品还没回来，卡丽显然生气了，一直说非得讨论一下，还想跟我打个小赌，闻气味来决定输赢。我说我一尝就能马上知道结果，接下来又是一阵愚蠢和多余的争论，结果我们突然发现已经十二点一刻了，错过了迎新年的时间，结婚以来这可是第一次。卢品凌晨两点一刻到家，之前在雾中迷路了——他是这么说的。","A most terrible fog came on, and Lupin would go out in it, but promised to be back to drink out the Old Year—a custom we have always observed. At a quarter to twelve Lupin had not returned, and the fog was fearful. As time was drawing close, I got out the spirits. Carrie and I deciding on whisky, I opened a fresh bottle; but Carrie said it smelt like brandy. As I knew it to be whisky, I said there was nothing to discuss. Carrie, evidently vexed that Lupin had not come in, did discuss it all the same, and wanted me to have a small wager with her to decide by the smell. I said I could decide it by the taste in a moment. A silly and unnecessary argument followed, the result of which was we suddenly saw it was a quarter-past twelve, and, for the first time in our married life, we missed welcoming in the New Year. Lupin got home at a quarter -past two, having got lost in the fog—so he said."
"第十四章","Chapter XIV"
"新年伊始，在公司意外升迁。我讲了两个挺不错的笑话。我的薪水大涨。卢品做投机买卖成功，开始用一辆小马车。不得不跟萨拉谈谈了。高英令人震惊的行为。","BEGIN THE YEAR WITH AN UNEXPECTED PROMOTION AT THE OFFICE. I MAKE TWO GOOD JOKES. I GET AN ENORMOUS RISE IN MY SALARY. LUPIN SPECULATES SUCCESSFULLY AND STARTS A PONY-TRAP. HAVE TO SPEAK TO SARAH. EXTRAORDINARY CONDUCT OF GOWING’S."
"1 月1 日上周，本打算结束我的日记，但发生了一件很重要的事，因此我会在去年日记后附的空白纸上再记一小段时间。刚刚一点半，我正要离开办公室去吃饭时，收到消息说波卡普先生想立刻见我。我得坦白讲，我的心开始怦怦跳了，特别担心。","January 1.I had intended concluding my diary last week; but a most important event has happened, so I shall continue for a little while longer on the fly-leaves attached to the end of my last year’s diary. It had just struck half-past one, and I was on the point of leaving the office to have my dinner, when I received a message that Mr. Perkupp desired to see me at once. I must confess that my heart commenced to beat and I had most serious misgivings."
"波卡普先生在他的房间写着东西，说：“坐吧，普特先生，我马上就好了。”我回答说：“不坐了，谢谢先生，我站着就行了。”我看着壁炉架上的钟，等了足足二十分钟，可感觉像过了好几个小时。终于，波卡普先生站了起来。","Mr. Perkupp was in his room writing, and he said: “Take a seat, Mr. Pooter, I shall not be a moment.” I replied: “No, thank you, sir; I’ll stand.” I watched the clock on the mantelpiece, and I was waiting quite twenty minutes; but it seemed hours. Mr. Perkupp at last got up himself."
"我说：“我希望没出啥事吧，先生？”他回答：“哦，没有！我想，正好相反。”我感觉真是如释重负啊！瞬间，我似乎又能喘气了。","I said: “I hope there is nothing wrong, sir?” He replied: “Oh dear, no! quite the reverse, I hope.” What a weight off my mind! My breath seemed to come back again in an instant."
"波卡普先生说：“巴克林先生要退休了，公司里会有些小的变动。你和我们一起工作了将近二十一年了，另外鉴于你这期间的表现，我们想特别提拔你。我们还没决定怎么安排你，可不管怎样，你的薪水会涨得不少，这完全是你应得的，根本不用我说了。我两点约了人见面，明天再跟你详细说。”","Mr. Perkupp said: “Mr. Buckling is going to retire, and there will be some slight changes in the office. You have been with us nearly twenty-one years, and, in consequence of your conduct during that period, we intend making a special promotion in your favour. We have not quite decided how you will be placed; but in any case there will be a considerable increase in your salary, which, it is quite unnecessary for me to say, you fully deserve. I have an appointment at two; but you shall hear more to-morrow.”"
"然后，他匆匆离开房间，都没有给我时间讲——甚至都不容我想——感谢他的话，哪怕一个词也好。亲爱的卡丽听到这个振奋人心的消息后的反应我就不必说了。她特别朴实地说：“我们终于能给后面客厅安个玻璃烟罩了，我们一直想买来着。”我补充说：“没错，你也终于能去彼得. 罗宾逊实惠商店，买下那身以前就看上的小套装了。”","He then left the room quickly, and I was not even allowed time or thought to express a single word of grateful thanks to him. I need not say how dear Carrie received this joyful news. With perfect simplicity she said: “At last we shall be able to have a chimney-glass for the back drawing-room, which we always wanted.” I added: “Yes, and at last you shall have that little costume which you saw at Peter Robinson’s so cheap.”"
"1 月2 日我在公司一整天都焦躁不安。我不想打扰波卡普先生，可他没派人来叫我，昨天还说今天会再找我的，所以我想也许最好还是我去找他。于是，我去敲了他的门。我一进去，波卡普先生就说：“哦，是你啊，普特先生，你找我有事吗？”我说：“没事，先生，我还以为你找我有事！”“噢！”他回答，“我想起来了。可我今天很忙，明天再找你吧。”","January 2.I was in a great state of suspense all day at the office. I did not like to worry Mr. Perkupp; but as he did not send for me, and mentioned yesterday that he would see me again to-day, I thought it better, perhaps, to go to him. I knocked at his door, and on entering, Mr. Perkupp said: “Oh! it’s you, Mr. Pooter; do you want to see me?” I said: “No, sir, I thought you wanted to see me!” “Oh!” he replied, “I remember. Well, I am very busy to-day; I will see you to-morrow.”"
"1 月3 日仍然处于焦虑、兴奋的状态，得知波卡普先生托人带话说他今天不在公司后，这种状态也没缓和。晚上，卢品忙着看报纸，突然对我说：“老爸，你知道“白垩矿场”吗？”我说：“不知道，孩子，我不懂。”卢品说：“好吧，我给你透露个秘密。“白垩矿场”跟统一公债一样安全，票面价值百分之六的回报率。”我说了句相当巧妙的话：“或许是票面价值百分之六的回报，可你爸没钱投资。”我和卡丽都哈哈大笑。尽管我有意将这句话重复了一遍给卢品听，可他压根都没注意这个玩笑，还继续说：“我给你透露的这个秘密，简单讲就是“白垩矿场”！”我又讲了句有趣的话：“小心别陷进去！”卢品不屑地笑着说：“妙！老掉牙的笑话了。”","January 3.Still in a state of anxiety and excitement, which was not alleviated by ascertaining that Mr. Perkupp sent word he should not be at the office at all to-day. In the evening, Lupin, who was busily engaged with a paper, said suddenly to me: “Do you know anything about chalk pits1, Guv.?” I said: “No, my boy, not that I’m aware of.” Lupin said: “Well, I give you the tip; chalk pits are as safe as Consols, and pay six per cent. at par2.” I said a rather neat thing, viz: “They may be six per cent. at par, but your pa has no money to invest.” Carrie and I both roared with laughter. Lupin did not take the slightest notice of the joke, although I purposely repeated it for him; but continued: “I give you the tip, that’s all—chalk pits!” I said another funny thing: “Mind you don’t fall into them!” Lupin put on a supercilious smile, and said: “Bravo! Joe Miller3.”"
"1 月4 日波卡普先生派人来叫我，他告诉我，我会晋升为一名高级职员。我高兴得不得了。波卡普先生还说，他明天会告诉我薪水是多少。这意味着又是一天的焦虑；不过我不介意，因为是为好事焦虑。这让我想起来我忘了跟卢品说我收到马特勒老先生信的事，晚上，我跟卢品提起这个事情，之前已经先跟卡丽商量过了。卢品专注于《金融新闻报》，好像他天生是个资本家一样，我说：“打扰你一小会儿，卢品，这礼拜怎么没去马特勒家？”","04-一月-2010Mr. Perkupp sent for me and told me that my position would be that of one of the senior clerks. I was more than overjoyed. Mr.Perkupp added, he would let me know to-morrow what the salary would be. This means another day’s anxiety; I don’t mind, for it is anxiety of the right sort. That reminded me that I had forgotten to speak to Lupin about the letter I received from Mr. Mutlar, senr. I broached the subject to Lupin in the evening, having first consulted Carrie. Lupin was riveted to the Financial News, as if he had been a born capitalist, and I said: “Pardon me a moment, Lupin, how is it you have not been to the Mutlars any day this week?”"
"卢品回答：“我告诉过你了！我受不了老马特勒。”我说：“马特勒先生给我写信说得很清楚，是他受不了你。”","Lupin answered: “I told you! I cannot stand old Mutlar.” I said: “Mr. Mutlar writes to me to say pretty plainly that he cannot stand you!”"
"卢品说：“好啊，他还有脸给你写信，我喜欢。我要查查他爸是不是还活着，然后我也给他写封短信，抱怨一下他儿子，而且我会写得清清楚楚，说他儿子就是个十足的傻瓜！”","Lupin said: “Well, I like his cheek in writing to you. I’ll find out if his father is still alive, and I will write him a note complaining of his son, and I’ll state pretty clearly that his son is a blithering idiot!”"
"我说：“卢品，当着你妈的面，请说话注意点儿。”","I said: “Lupin, please moderate your expressions in the presence of your mother.”"
"卢品说：“我很抱歉，但是没别的话比这更适合他了。不过，我决定不再进他家门了。”","Lupin said: “I’m very sorry, but there is no other expression one can apply to him. However, I’m determined not to enter his place again.”"
"我说：“卢品，你知道，是他不让你进门了吧。”","I said: “You know, Lupin, he has forbidden you the house.”"
"卢品回答说：“唉，我们别为小事争吵了——都一样。黛西是靠得住的人，如果有必要，她会等我十年。”","Lupin replied: “Well, we won’t split straws— it’s all the same. Daisy is a trump, and will wait for me ten years, if necessary.”"
"1 月5 日我几乎无法写下这个消息。波卡普先生告诉我，我的薪水会涨100 英镑！我站在那儿，脑中一片空白，半天缓不过神来。我的薪水每年涨10 英镑，我原本以为这次可能会涨15 英镑，或者甚至20 英镑，可100 英镑，简直不敢相信。我和卡丽都为我们的好运而高兴。晚上，卢品回到家，兴致很高。我悄悄地让萨拉去商店买了瓶香槟，就要我们以前喝过的牌子——“杰克逊. 福莱赖斯”。晚饭时候打开酒，我对卢品说：“这是为了庆祝今天我得到的好消息。”卢品回答：“老爸，万岁！我也有好消息，双喜临门啊，是吧？”我说：“孩子，由于二十一年来我在公司兢兢业业，严格为我的头儿们的利益着想，因此作为奖励，我被晋升，薪水还涨了100 英镑。”","January 5.I can scarcely write the news. Mr Perkupp told me my salary would be raised £100! I stood gaping for a moment unable to realize it. I annually get £10 rise, and I thought it might be £15 or even £20; but £100 surpasses all belief. Carrie and I both rejoiced over our good fortune. Lupin came home in the evening in the utmost good spirits. I sent Sarah quietly round to the grocer’s for a bottle of champagne, the same as we had before, “Jackson Frères.” It was opened at supper, and I said to Lupin: “This is to celebrate some good news I have received to-day.” Lupin replied: “Hooray, Guv.! And I have some good news, also; a double event, eh?” I said: “My boy, as a result of twenty-one years’ industry and strict attention to the interests of my superiors in office, I have been rewarded with promotion and a rise in salary of £100.”"
"卢品欢呼了三声，我们猛劲儿地敲桌子，弄得萨拉都进来看发生什么事了。卢品让我们再“满上”，站着对我们说：“在乔布. 克里纳兹股票经纪公司已经干了几个星期了，没有特别维护过公司里头儿们的利益，作为对我的奖励，老板分给我五英镑走势很好的股票。结果今天我赚了200 英镑。”我说：“卢品，你在开玩笑吧。”“不，老爸，这是‘老好’的真理, 乔布. 克里纳兹让我投资“氯酸盐”的股票。”","Lupin gave three cheers, and we rapped the table furiously, which brought in Sarah to see what the matter was. Lupin ordered us to “fill up” again, and addressing us upstanding, said: “Having been in the firm of Job Cleanands, stock and share-brokers, a few weeks, and not having paid particular attention to the interests of my superiors in office, my Guv’nor, as a reward to me, allotted me £5 worth of shares in a really good thing. The result is, to-day I have made £200.” I said: “Lupin, you are joking.” “No, Guv., it’s the good old truth; Job Cleanands put me on to Chlorates.”"
"1 月21 日卢品开始使用一辆小马车，让我非常担心。我说：“卢品，你这让人忍无可忍的奢侈行为有正当理由吗？”卢品回答：“哎呀，我们总得设法去市里呀。这只是租来的，我要是不想用了，随时可以不要它。”我重复了一下我的问题：“你这种奢侈行为有正当理由吗？”他回答：“看看，老爸。原谅我这么说，可你有点落伍了。现在，在小事上斤斤计较没好处。我不是针对你，老爸。我老板说，如果我听他的提示，坚持干大事，就能赚大钱！”我说我觉得投机倒把这样的想法最可怕。卢品说：“这不是投机倒把，而是绝对可靠的事。”无论如何，我建议他不要再用小马车了，可他回答说：“我一天赚200 英镑，现在假设一个月我只赚200 英镑，或就算一个月100 英镑——这已经少得可怜了——哎呀，一年就是1250 英镑。一礼拜花几英镑的车钱算啥？”","January 21.I am very much concerned at Lupin having started a pony-trap. I said: “Lupin, are you justified in this outrageous extravagance?” Lupin replied: “Well, one must get to the City somehow. I’ve only hired it, and can give it up any time I like.” I repeated my question: “Are you justified in this extravagance?” He replied: “Look here, Guv.; excuse my saying so, but you’re a bit out of date. It does not pay nowadays, fiddling about over small things. I don’t mean anything personal, Guv’nor. My boss says if I take his tip, and stick to big things, I can make big money!” I said I thought the very idea of speculation most horrifying. Lupin said: “It is not speculation, it’s a dead cert.” I advised him, at all events, not to continue the pony and cart; but he replied: “I made £200 in one day; now suppose I only make £200 in a month, or put it at £100 a month, which is ridiculously low—why, that is £1,250 a year. What’s a few pounds a week for a trap?”"
"我没再继续说这个话题，而只是说秋天到来时我会很高兴，那时卢品就成年了，有责任自己背负债务了。他回答说：“我亲爱的老爸，我真心向您保证，我决不会举债投资。我只会继续听取乔布. 克里纳兹的提示，因为他‘懂行’，所以非常保险。”我感觉放心了一些。晚上，高英来串门，让我吃惊的是，他告诉我，卢品的一个提示让他赚了10 英镑，因此他打算请我们和卡明斯夫妇下周六去他家。我和卡丽说很乐意去。","I did not pursue the subject further, beyond saying that I should feel glad when the autumn came, and Lupin would be of age and responsible for his own debts. He answered: “My dear Guv., I promise you faithfully that I will never speculate with what I have not got. I shall only go on Job Cleanands’ tips, and as he is in the ‘know’ it is pretty safe sailing.” I felt somewhat relieved. Gowing called in the evening and, to my surprise, informed me that, as he had made £10 by one of Lupin’s tips, he intended asking us and the Cummings round next Saturday. Carrie and I said we should be delighted."
"1 月22 日我一般不跟佣人生气，可我不得不严厉地说说萨拉，她最近养成了一个粗心大意的习惯：吃完早饭把桌上的东西拿走以后，她开始抖桌布，搞得面包屑全落到地毯上，最后都被踩了进去。萨拉很无礼地回答：“噢，你总是在抱怨。”我回答：“事实上，我没有。我说你鞋后跟上粘了块黄肥皂在客厅地毯上到处走，这是上周的事了。”她说：“你还总抱怨早饭。”我说：“没有，我没有总抱怨，可我觉得我完全有理由抱怨从来都吃不到煮熟的鸡蛋。我一打碎蛋壳，蛋就喷得盘子里到处都是，这件事我跟你说了不下五十次。”她开始哭了，还大吵大闹，幸好我要乘坐的公共马车到了，这样我就有了个好理由离开了她。晚上，高英留下口信要我们别忘了下个礼拜六的事。卡丽风趣地说：“我们不大可能会忘了，因为他以前从来没邀请过朋友们。”","January 22.I don’t generally lose my temper with servants; but I had to speak to Sarah rather sharply about a careless habit she has recently contracted of shaking the table-cloth, after removing the breakfast things, in a manner which causes all the crumbs to fall on the carpet, eventually to be trodden in. Sarah answered very rudely: “Oh, you are always complaining.” I replied: “Indeed, I am not. I spoke to you last week about walking all over the drawing-room carpet with a piece of yellow soap on the heel of your boot.” She said: “And you’re always grumbling about your breakfast.” I said: “No, I am not; but I feel perfectly justified in complaining that I never can get a hard-boiled egg. The moment I crack the shell it spurts all over the plate, and I have spoken to you at least fifty times about it.” She began to cry and make a scene; but fortunately my ’bus came by, so I had a good excuse for leaving her. Gowing left a message in the evening, that we were not to forget next Saturday. Carrie amusingly said: “As he has never asked any friends before, we are not likely to forget it.”"
"1 月23 日卢品最近送给我几把发刷。我让卢品试着把硬刷子换成软点的，因为我的理发师刚刚告诉我，我的头发不应该刷得太重。","January 23.I asked Lupin to try and change the hard brushes, he recently made me a present of, for some softer ones, as my hairdresser tells me I ought not to brush my hair too much just now."
"1 月24 日后面客厅的新玻璃烟罩到了，卡丽在顶上和两边各摆了几把扇子，非常漂亮。这使整个屋子改观不少。","January 24.The new chimney-glass came home for the back drawing-room. Carrie arranged some fans very prettily on the top and on each side. It is an immense improvement to the room."
"1 月25 日我们刚喝完茶，这时有人进来，竟然是卡明斯，他有超过三个礼拜没来这儿了。我注意到他看上去脸色很差，于是我说：“嗨，卡明斯，你好吗？你看上去有点儿无精打采。”他回答说：“是的，我心里也感觉郁闷。”我说：“哎呀，怎么回事？”他说：“哦，没事儿，只是我在床上躺了几个礼拜，没啥。一度我的医生都差点放弃我了，可都没人去看过我，甚至都没人费心问问我是死是活。”","January 25.We had just finished our tea, when who should come in but Cummings, who has not been here for over three weeks. I noticed that he looked anything but well, so I said: “Well, Cummings, how are you? You look a little blue.” He replied: “Yes! and I feel blue too.” I said: “Why, what’s the matter?” He said: “Oh, nothing, except that I have been on my back for a couple of weeks, that’s all. At one time my doctor nearly gave me up, yet not a soul has come near me. No one has even taken the trouble to inquire whether I was alive or dead.”"
"我说：“这是我第一次听说这件事。有几个晚上，我路过你家门口，还以为你有客人呢，因为屋子里灯火通明。”","I said: “This is the first I have heard of it. I have passed your house several nights, and presumed you had company, as the rooms were so brilliantly lighted.”"
"卡明斯回答：“没有！只有我老婆、医生和女房东陪着我——原来房东太太真是个大好人。我奇怪你竟然没在报纸上看到这消息。我知道《自行车新闻报》上提到了。”","Cummings replied: “No! The only company I have had was my wife, the doctor, and the landlady—the last-named having turned out a perfect trump. I wonder you did not see it in the paper. I know it was mentioned in the Bicycle News.”"
"我想让他高兴点，说：“那你现在好了吧？”","I thought to cheer him up, and said: “Well, you are all right now?”"
"他回答说：“这不是问题。问题在于，是不是生病能让你发现谁是你真正的朋友。”","He replied: “That’s not the question. The question is whether an illness does not enable you to discover who are your true friends.”"
"我说他不应该说出这种话。更糟糕的是，高英进来，在卡明斯背上重重拍了一下，说：“喂！你看见鬼了啊？看着像要被吓死的样子，像《麦克白》里的欧文。”我说：“轻点儿，高英，这可怜的家伙刚刚大病了一场。”高英大笑，说：“对，你看起来也像大病了一场。”卡明斯平静地说：“是的，我觉得也像——不过不觉得你关心我。”","I said such an observation was unworthy of him. To make matters worse, in came Gowing, who gave Cummings a violent slap on the back, and said: “Hulloh! Have you seen a ghost? You look scared to death, like Irving in Macbeth.” I said: “Gently, Gowing, the poor fellow has been very ill.” Gowing roared with laughter and said: “Yes, and you look it, too.” Cummings quietly said: “Yes, and I feel it too—not that I suppose you care.”"
"接下来是一阵尴尬的沉默。高英说：“没关系，卡明斯，明天你和你太太来我家，会让你高兴点儿的，因为我们要开一瓶葡萄酒。”","An awkward silence followed. Gowing said: “Never mind, Cummings, you and the missis come round to my place tomorrow, and it will cheer you up a bit; for we’ll open a bottle of wine.”"
"1 月26 日发生了一件令人震惊的事。我和卡丽按计划，七点半来到高英家。敲了几下门，又按了几次铃，都没人答应。最后，插销终于拉开了，门开了个小缝，链锁还拴着。一个穿着衬衫的人探出脑袋说：“谁啊？啥事？”","January 26.An extraordinary thing happened. Carrie and I went round to Gowing’s, as arranged, at half-past seven. We knocked and rang several times without getting an answer. At last the latch was drawn and the door opened a little way, the chain still being up.  A man in shirt-sleeves put his head through and said: “Who is it? What do you want?”"
"我说：“找高英先生，他在等我们。”那个人说（这是我尽力听到的，因为有只小狗在狂吠）：“我想他没在等你们。高英先生不在家。”我说：“他马上会回来的。”"," I said: “Mr. Gowing, he is expecting us.” The man said (as well as I could hear, owing to the yapping of a little dog): “I don’t think he is. Mr. Gowing is not at home.” I said: “He will be in directly.”"
"听了这话，他猛地关上了门，留下我和卡丽站在台阶上，街角刮着刺骨的寒风。","With that observation he slammed the door, leaving Carrie and me standing on the steps with a cutting wind blowing round the corner."
"卡丽建议我再去敲门。我照做了，这才第一次发现门环刚刷过漆，油漆粘到了我手套上，结果把手套弄得很脏。","Carrie advised me to knock again. I did so, and then discovered for the first time that the knocker had been newly painted, and the paint had come off on my gloves—which were, in consequence, completely spoiled."
"我用手杖敲了两三下门。","I knocked at the door with my stick two or three times."
"那个人打开了门，这次拿下了链锁，开始骂我。他说：“你用那样的手杖刮掉油漆，想怎么样啊，想弄花门面吗？你应该为你自己感到羞愧。”","The man opened the door, taking the chain off this time, and began abusing me. He said: “What do you mean by scratching the paint with your stick like that, spoiling the varnish? You ought to be ashamed of yourself.”"
"我说：“对不起，高英先生邀请——”","I said: “Pardon me, Mr. Gowing invited—”"
"他打断我的话，说：“我不管是高英先生，还是他的任何朋友。这是我的门，不是高英先生的。这里除了高英先生还有别人呢。”","He interrupted and said: “I don’t care for Mr. Gowing, or any of his friends. This is my door, not Mr. Gowing’s. There are people here besides Mr. Gowing.”"
"这个人的无礼倒没啥，我几乎都没在意。与高英可恶的行为比起来，他的无礼太微不足道了。","The impertinence of this man was nothing. I scarcely noticed it, it was so trivial in comparison with the scandalous conduct of Gowing."
"这时候，卡明斯和他太太到了。卡明斯一瘸一拐的，拄着手杖；可还是上了台阶，问怎么回事。","At this moment Cummings and his wife arrived. Cummings was very lame and leaning on a stick; but got up the steps and asked what the matter was."
"那个人说：“高英先生没说过要等人来。他只说他刚刚收到去克罗伊登的邀请，下个礼拜一晚上才能回来。他随身带了行李。”","The man said: “Mr. Gowing said nothing about expecting anyone. All he said was he had just received an invitation to Croydon, and he should not be back till Monday evening. He took his bag with him."
"说着，他又猛地关上了门。高英的行为让我愤怒得说不出话来。卡明斯气得脸看上去都白了。他下台阶的时候，手杖在地上敲得很响，还说：“混账！”","With that he slammed the door again. I was too indignant with Gowing’s conduct to say anything. Cummings looked white with rage, and as he descended the steps struck his stick violently on the ground and said: “Scoundrel!”"

"在弗朗清家吃饭，见了哈德弗. 哈特尔先生。","DINNER AT FRANCHING’S TO MEET MR. HARDFUR HUTTLE."
"5 月10 日收到派克汉姆的弗朗清先生写的一封信，邀请我们今晚七点与他共进晚餐，好见见哈德弗. 哈特尔先生，一位非常聪明的美国报纸作家。弗朗清为提前这么短的时间才通知而道歉；可他说，刚刚得知有两个客人不能来了，感到很失望，他当我们是老朋友，想着我们不会介意填补这空白。卡丽对这个邀请相当不满，可我跟她解释说弗朗清先生很有钱，而且也很有影响力，我们得罪不起他。“我们一定会吃到一顿美味，喝到一杯美酒的。”“你总是一喝就难受！”卡丽尖刻地回答。我就当她什么也没说。弗朗清先生要求我们回封电报，他信上没说着装的事，因此我回电说：“乐意前往，着礼服？”因为没署名，仅花不到六便士就发了电报。","May 10.Received a letter from Mr. Franching, of Peckham, asking us to dine with him to-night, at seven o’clock, to meet Mr. Hardfur Huttle, a very clever writer for the American papers. Franching apologised for the short notice; but said he had at the last moment been disappointed of two of his guests and regarded us as old friends who would not mind filling up the gap. Carrie rather demurred at the invitation; but I explained to her that Franching was very well off and influential, and we could not afford to offend him. “And we are sure to get a good dinner and a good glass of champagne.” “Which never agrees with you!” Carrie replied, sharply. I regarded Carrie’s observation as unsaid. Mr. Franching asked us to wire a reply. As he had said nothing about dress in the letter, I wired back: “With pleasure. Is it full dress?” and by leaving out our name, just got the message within the sixpence."
"下班早早回家，留出时间来换衣服，我们收到电报要求穿礼服。我想让卡丽在弗朗清家和我会合，可她不干，所以我还得回家接她。从霍洛韦到派克汉姆好远啊！为什么人们的住处离得这么远？因为还得倒车，所以我留出了许多时间——事实上，留太多了，因为我们到时还有二十分钟才到七点，佣人说弗朗清先生刚上楼去换衣服。不过，时钟刚敲了七点，他就下来了，他换衣服一定非常快。","Got back early to give time to dress, which we received a telegram instructing us to do. I wanted Carrie to meet me at Franching’s house; but she would not do so, so I had to go home to fetch her. What a long journey it is from Holloway to Peckham! Why do people live such a long way off? Having to change ’buses, I allowed plenty of time—in fact, too much; for we arrived at twenty minutes to seven, and Franching, so the servant said, had only just gone up to dress. However, he was down as the clock struck seven; he must have dressed very quickly."
"我得说，这个聚会很有档次，尽管私下里我们一个人也不认识，但他们看起来都像是有头有脸的人。弗朗清请了一个专业服务员，显然是不惜花费。桌上摆着很多花，围绕着几盏彩色小灯，我得说，效果棒极了。葡萄酒很不错，还有很多香槟。关于香槟弗朗清说他自己觉得那是最好的香槟酒了。我们总共十个人，人手一份菜单，一位女士说她总是收藏菜单，并请客人们在菜单背面签名。","I must say it was quite a distinguished party, and although we did not know anybody personally, they all seemed to be quite swells. Franching had got a professional waiter, and evidently spared no expense. There were flowers on the table round some fairy-lamps, and the effect, I must say, was exquisite. The wine was good and there was plenty of champagne, concerning which Franching said he, himself, never wished to taste better. We were ten in number, and a menû card to each. One lady said she always preserved the menû and got the guests to write their names on the back."
"我们大家纷纷效仿她，除了哈特尔先生，当然，他就是那位重要客人。","We all of us followed her example, except Mr. Huttle, who was of course the important guest."
"参加晚宴的有弗朗清先生、哈德弗. 哈特尔先生、塞缪尔. 希尔巴特夫妇、菲尔德太太、帕蒂克夫妇、普拉特先生、R. 肯特先生，最后但同样重要的是查尔斯. 普特夫妇。弗朗清先生说他很抱歉他没有女士陪我用餐，我回答说我希望如此，后来我觉得这话说得很不礼貌。","The dinner-party consisted of Mr. Franching, Mr. Hardfur Huttle, Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Hillbutter, Mrs. Field, Mr. and Mrs. Purdick, Mr. Pratt, Mr. R. Kent, and, last but not least, Mr. and Mrs. Charles Pooter. Franching said he was sorry he had no lady for me to take in to dinner. I replied that I preferred it, which I afterwards thought was a very uncomplimentary observation to make."
"晚宴时，我挨着菲尔德太太坐，她看起来是位博识的贵妇人，可耳朵很不好使。不过没有太大关系，因为全是哈德弗. 哈特尔先生一个人在说。他知识渊博，非常了不起，他讲的事情从别人嘴里说出来似乎会很恐怖。我多想把他哪怕四分之一的精彩讲话记住啊，我在菜单上记了几点提示。","I sat next to Mrs. Field at dinner. She seemed a well-informed lady, but was very deaf. It did not much matter, for Mr. Hardfur Huttle did all the talking. He is a marvellously intellectual man and says things which from other people would seem quite alarming. How I wish I could remember even a quarter of his brilliant conversation. I made a few little reminding notes on the menû card."
"有句话对我触动很大，绝对有力——不过，当然跟我的思维方式不一样。帕蒂克太太恰巧说了句：“哈特尔先生，您的确不正统。”哈特尔先生一脸奇怪的表情（我现在还记得），用他圆润的嗓音缓慢地说：“帕蒂克太太，‘正统’是个夸张的词，暗指陷入泥坑，固步不前。如果哥伦布和斯蒂芬森正统的话，就不会发现美洲大陆，也不会有蒸汽机了。”大家陷入一片沉静。","One observation struck me as being absolutely powerful—though not to my way of thinking of course. Mrs. Purdick happened to say: “You are certainly unorthodox, Mr. Huttle.” Mr. Huttle, with a peculiar expression (I can see it now) said in a slow, rich voice: “Mrs. Purdick, ‘orthodox’ is a grandiloquent word implying sticking-in-the-mud. If Columbus and Stephenson had been orthodox, there would neither have been the discovery of America nor the steam-engine.” There was quite a silence."
"在我看来，这种说教绝对危险，而且我觉得——实际上大家一定都觉得——这话无可辩驳。过了一会儿，帕蒂克太太——她是弗朗清的妹妹，还充当了女主人的角色——站了起来，然后哈特尔先生说：“女士们，为什么这么快就不陪我们了？为什么不等等，我们抽支烟。”","It appeared to me that such teaching was absolutely dangerous, and yet I felt—in fact we must all have felt—there was no answer to the argument. A little later on, Mrs. Purdick, who is Franching’s sister and also acted as hostess, rose from the table, and Mr. Huttle said: “Why, ladies, do you deprive us of your company so soon? Why not wait while we have our cigars? ”"
"效果非常明显，女士们（包括卡丽）根本不愿意放弃享受哈特尔先生迷人的社交方式的机会，于是迅速回到座位上坐下，笑声、玩笑声不断。哈特尔先生说：“不错，这真是个好现象；你们不会再受侮辱，被说成正统了。”帕蒂克太太看起来是个开朗而又精明的女人，她说：“哈特尔先生，我们等您烟抽到一半的时候再来陪您。不管怎么样，这会是种折中办法。”","The effect was electrical. The ladies (including Carrie) were in no way inclined to be deprived of Mr. Huttle’s fascinating society, and immediately resumed their seats, amid much laughter and a little chaff. Mr. Huttle said: “Well, that’s a real good sign; you shall not be insulted by being called orthodox any longer.” Mrs. Purdick, who seemed to be a bright and rather sharp woman, said: “Mr. Huttle, we will meet you half-way—that is, till you get half-way through your cigar. That, at all events, will be the happy medium.”"
"我永远都不会忘记“折中”这个词对哈特尔先生产生的效果，他很有才气，十分大胆地诠释了这个词，让我十分惊讶。他的话大概是这样：“折中，确实是这样。你们知道‘折中’这两个字的意思是‘可怜的平庸’吗？我说，要么要头等的，要么要三等的；娶媳妇就要娶个女公爵，要么就娶她的厨房佣人。折中意味着可敬，可敬意味着乏味。是吧，普特先生？”","I shall never forget the effect the words, “happy medium,” had upon him. He was brilliant and most daring in his interpretation of the words. He positively alarmed me. He said something like the following: “Happy medium, indeed. Do you know ‘happy medium’ are two words which mean ‘miserable mediocrity.’ I say, go first class or third; marry a duchess or her kitchen maid. The happy medium means respectability, and respectability means insipidness. Does it not, Mr. Pooter?”"
"我大吃一惊，居然单单问我的意见。于是只能抱歉地鞠躬，说我恐怕不够格，不能发表意见，卡丽正要说话，但被打断了。对此我很高兴，因为她在辩论方面并不聪明，得相当聪明的人才能跟像哈特尔先生这样的人讨论。","I was so taken aback by being personally appealed to, that I could only bow apologetically, and say I feared I was not competent to offer an opinion. Carrie was about to say something; but she was interrupted, for which I was rather pleased, for she is not clever at argument and one has to be extra clever to discuss a subject with a man like Mr. Huttle."
"他继续讲，口才惊人，这让他本不受欢迎的意见变得很有说服力：“折中正好就是庸俗地半途而废。一个人喜欢喝香槟，发现一品脱太少，又害怕喝一瓶，于是只能转而使用特大号的品脱容器。这种人永远都造不出布鲁克林大桥或埃菲尔铁塔。对，他们就是三心二意，半途而废——可敬啊——实际上，就是折中。他们会在城郊别墅里度过余生，别墅带有灰泥石柱搭成的门廊，活像四根床架。","He continued, with an amazing eloquence that made his unwelcome opinions positively con vincing: “The happy medium is nothing more or less than a vulgar half-measure. A man who loves champagne and, finding a pint too little, fears to face a whole bottle and has recourse to an imperial pint, will never build a Brooklyn Bridge or an Eiffel Tower. No, he is half-hearted, he is a half-measure—respectable—in fact, a happy medium, and will spend the rest of his days in a suburban villa with a stucco-column portico, resembling a four-post bedstead.”"
"我们都笑起来。","We all laughed."
"哈特尔先生继续说：“那些东西属于温柔的人，长着柔和的胡子，柔和的脑袋，系着现成的挂钩领带。”","“That sort of thing,” continued Mr. Huttle, “belongs to a soft man, with a soft beard, with a soft head, with a made tie that hooks on.”"
"这似乎是针对个人的，我两次不自觉地在小衣橱的镜子里看了看自己，因为我系了一条挂钩领带——可为什么不行？如果这些话不是针对个人，那么就是很欠考虑。哈特尔先生接下来的话也如此，那话一定让弗朗清先生和他的客人们觉得很不舒服。我觉得哈特尔先生不是针对个人，因为他还说：“在这个国家我们不知道有那样的人，但在美国有，我不喜欢他们。”","This seemed rather personal and twice I caught myself looking in the glass of the Cheffonière; for I had on a tie that hooked on—and why not? If these remarks were not personal they were rather careless, and so were some of his subsequent observations, which must have made both Mr. Franching and his guests rather uncomfortable. I don’t think Mr. Huttle meant to be personal, for he added: “We don’t know that class here, in this country; but we do in America, and I’ve no use for them.”"
"弗朗清先生几次建议将葡萄酒在桌上传一传，哈特尔先生没有注意，还在继续着，好像他在做演讲：","Franching several times suggested that the wine should be passed round the table, which Mr. Huttle did not heed; but continued as if he were giving a lecture:"
"“在美国，我们想要的是你们这样的家。我们居无定所。弗朗清先生，您朴素、安宁的生活和简朴、安静的家很让人羡慕。不显摆，不做作！我敢说，您一个人用餐和请我们大家用餐没有什么不同，您有自己的私人服务员——不需要雇来的服务员，在您脑袋后面喘气。”","“What we want in America is your homes. We live on wheels. Your simple, quiet life and home, Mr. Franching, are charming. No display, no pretension! You make no difference in your dinner, I dare say, when you sit down by yourself and when you invite us. You have your own personal attendant—no hired waiter to breathe on the back of your head.”"
"我看到弗朗清先生听着这话明显感到尴尬。","I saw Franching palpably wince at this."
"哈特尔先生继续说：“只是一顿简单的晚餐，有几样好菜，就像您今晚桌上摆的一样。您不会到杂货店买六先令一瓶的香槟来侮辱您的客人。”","Mr. Huttle continued: “Just a small dinner with a few good things, such as you have this evening. You don’t insult your guests by sending to the grocer for champagne at six shillings a bottle.”"
"我不由想起三先令六便士一瓶的“杰克逊. 福莱赖斯”！","I could not help thinking of “Jackson Frères” at three-and-six!"
"“实际上，”哈特尔先生说，“买那种酒的人跟谋杀犯也没多大区别。晚上浪费时间，在家跟老婆玩多米诺骨牌，那是胆小鬼所为。我听说过这样的人，我们这一桌可不想要这种人，我们聚会的人可是精心挑选的。我们不喜欢耳背的老女人，她们听不懂我们的智慧谈话。”","“In fact,” said Mr. Huttle, “a man is little less than a murderer who does. That is the province of the milksop, who wastes his evening at home playing dominoes with his wife. I’ve heard of these people. We don’t want them at this table. Our party is well selected. We’ve no use for deaf old women, who cannot follow intellectual conversation.”"
"我们大家的眼睛都转向菲尔德太太，幸好她耳背，没有听到哈特尔先生的话，竟还继续笑着表示认同。","All our eyes were turned to Mrs. Field, who fortunately, being deaf, did not hear his remarks; but continued smiling approval."
"“弗朗清家的饭桌上也没有这种典型，”哈特尔先生说，“无知、轻浮的家庭主妇，她去参加贝斯沃特二流的舞会，却幻想自己已经进入了上流社会。上流社会不认可她，也不喜欢她。”","“We have no representative at Mr. Franching’s table,” said Mr. Huttle, “of the unenlightened frivolous matron, who goes to a second class dance at Bayswater and fancies she is in Society. Society does not know her; it has no use for her.”"
"哈特尔先生停顿了一会儿，正好给了女士们机会起身。我悄悄地向弗朗清先生告辞，因为不想误了最后一班火车。顺便说一下，我们差点就误了，因为卡丽把她出来时戴的那顶棉布小鸭舌帽放错地方了。","Mr. Huttle paused for a moment and the opportunity was afforded for the ladies to rise. I asked Mr. Franching quietly to excuse me, as I did not wish to miss the last train, which we very nearly did, by-the-by, through Carrie having mislaid the little cloth cricketcap which she wears when we go out."
"我和卡丽到家已经很晚了，但一进客厅，我就说：“卡丽，你觉得哈德弗. 哈特尔先生怎么样啊？”","It was very late when Carrie and I got home; but on entering the sitting-room I said: “Carrie, what do you think of Mr. Hardfur Huttle?”"
"她只简单回答了一句：“多像卢品啊！”在火车上我就这么想，这样的比较让我到半夜都没睡着。当然哈特尔先生要老一些，而且更有影响力，可他确实像卢品。这让我觉得要是卢品再长大点、影响力更大点的话，该多么危险啊。从某些方面看，卢品的确像哈特尔先生，这让我觉得很自豪。卢品像哈特尔先生一样有独特的想法，有时还不错。可正是这些想法很危险，它可以让一个人很富有，也可以让他很贫穷，可以成就一个人，也可以毁掉一个人。我一直觉得生活简单淳朴的人更幸福。我认为我就很幸福，因为我没有野心。不知道是什么原因，我感觉卢品自从到了波卡普先生的公司，变得愿意静下心来，沿着他父亲的足迹走了，这让我感到欣慰。","She simply answered: “How like Lupin!” The same idea occurred to me in the train. The comparison kept me awake half the night. Mr. Huttle was, of course, an older and more influential man; but he was like Lupin, and it made me think how dangerous Lupin would be if he were older and more influential. I feel proud to think Lupin does resemble Mr. Huttle in some ways. Lupin, like Mr. Huttle, has original and sometimes wonderful ideas; but it is those ideas that are so dangerous. They make men extremely rich or extremely poor. They make or break men. I always feel people are happier who live a simple unsophisticated life. I believe I am happy because I am not ambitious. Somehow I feel that Lupin, since he has been with Mr. Perkupp, has become content to settle down and follow the footsteps of his father. This is a comfort."
