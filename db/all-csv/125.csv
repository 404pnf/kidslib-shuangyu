"前几天，在G将军主办的晚宴上，穿着最为时尚的女士要数G. C.夫人了。她穿了一身粉色的绸缎礼服。礼服正面十分朴素，但背面有许多锯齿状裙边——我是说拖裙那儿；据说她的拖裙有两三码长。人们发现，夫人离开了之后，她的拖裙还在地板上拖了一小会儿。C夫人还穿了一件斜着裁的白色紧身衣，袖子上有小花卉纹的图案，上面有褶裥饰边；她的领口很低，里面的领巾看不出来；她手上戴着一双白色小羊皮手套。她戴着一条珍珠项链。项链高高地挂在光光的脖子和肩膀上，闪着微光，给人一种孤寂的感觉。耳朵前面的头发卷了起来，像缠绕在一起的灌木丛一样；耳后的头发扎了起来，紧紧地束在一起，编成一条粗辫子，像马尾巴一样，并且呈特定的角度向上倾斜着，用一条红色天鹅绒缎带支撑着，十分巧妙。缎带的最前端在头顶的发夹上打个半套结，固定住了。她的整个头型利落得体。她刚进来的时候，气色很好，但不知什么缘故，这种好气色渐渐消失了。不过，它并非再也不见踪迹。后来，我发现，绝大部分都留在了我的肩膀上。（她随着人群向外挤时，我正站在门口。）当天出席晚宴的还有其他女士，但是我只选了其中一位作为时尚样本，记录下来。如果我描述得还算形象的话，我很乐意进一步详述这个话题。","At General G—’s reception the other night, the most fashionably dressed lady was Mrs. G. C.She wore a pink satin dress, plain in front but with a good deal of rake to it—to the train, I mean; it was said to be two or three yards long.One could see it creeping along the floor some little time after the woman was gone.Mrs. C. wore also a white bodice, cut bias, with Pompadour sleeves, flounced with ruches; low neck, with the inside handkerchief not visible, with white kid gloves.She had on a pearl necklace, which glinted lonely, high up the midst of that barren waste of neck and shoulders.Her hair was frizzled into a tangled chaparral, forward of her ears, aft it was drawn together, and compactly bound and plaited into a stump like a pony’s tail, and furthermore was canted upward at a sharp angle, and ingeniously supported by a red velvet crupper, whose forward extremity was made fast with a half-hitch around a hairpin on the top of her head.Her whole top hamper was neat and becoming.She had a beautiful complexion when she first came, but it faded out by degrees in an unaccountable way.However, it is not lost for good.I found the most of it on my shoulder afterward.(I stood near the door when she squeezed out with the throng.)There were other ladies present, but I only took notes of one as a specimen.I would gladly enlarge upon the subject were I able to do it justice."
