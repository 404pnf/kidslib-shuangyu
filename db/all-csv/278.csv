"遗孀","The Wives of the Dead"
"作者：纳撒尼尔·霍桑","by Nathaniel Hawthorne"
"下面这个故事，说的不过是些简单的家庭小事。虽然人们或许认为它们几乎不值一提，但是随着时间的流逝，人们对100年前发生在马萨诸塞一个主要海港城市的事情，又产生了些兴趣。这是一个飘着秋雨的黄昏。这是一座小楼三楼的客厅，房间陈设很简单，与住户的中等境况很相符。不过，房间里摆放着从海外带来的新奇小玩意，以及一些印度制造的精美标本——这些就是我们要事先提到的关于时间和地点的几处细节。两位年轻标致的女子一起坐在炉边，她们心中有着共同的悲伤，但又有所不同。她们是一对兄弟的新婚妻子，兄弟二人一人是水手，另一人则居于陆地。两天之内，兄弟俩的死讯相继传来。两人都死于意外，一人死于加拿大战争，另一人则丧命于大西洋风暴中。噩耗传来，人们都十分同情，许多人来到这两位遗孀妯娌的住所表示哀悼。有几个人一直呆到天色将黑，其中有一位是牧师。他们挨个低声诵读《圣经》中许多抚慰人心的段落，却换来了更多的泪水。然后他们各自离开，回到自己幸福的家中。虽然这两个悲伤的人知道朋友们的好意，但是她们更希望独自呆着。她们曾因为生者而关系紧密，现在因为逝者关系更加紧密了；两人都似乎感觉到，无论她们的痛苦需要何种慰藉，都能在对方的内心找到。她们心连着心，一起默默地流泪。但是，沉浸在这种悲伤中一小时后，两人当中性格温和、文静却并不柔弱的那一人影响了两人所有的情绪。她回想起了有关顺从和忍耐的宗教规诫，那些都是虔诚教会她的，但当时她认为自己并不需要它们。而且，她是最早得知不幸的，也理应最早不让悲痛扰乱她正常的生活。于是，她把饭桌摆放在炉火前面，准备了一顿便饭，然后抓起同伴的手。","The following story, the simple and domestic incidents of which may be deemed scarcely worth relating, after such a lapse of time, awakened some degree of interest, a hundred years ago, in a principal seaport of the Bay Province.The rainy twilight of an autumn day,—a parlor on the second floor of a small house, plainly furnished, as beseemed the middling circumstances of its inhabitants, yet decorated with little curiosities from beyond the sea, and a few delicate specimens of Indian manufacture,—these are the only particulars to be premised in regard to scene and season.Two young and comely women sat together by the fireside, nursing their mutual and peculiar sorrows.They were the recent brides of two brothers, a sailor and a landsman, and two successive days had brought tidings of the death of each, by the chances of Canadian warfare and the tempestuous Atlantic.The universal sympathy excited by this bereavement drew numerous condoling guests to the habitation of the widowed sisters.Several, among whom was the minister, had remained till the verge of evening; when, one by one, whispering many comfortable passages of Scripture, that were answered by more abundant tears, they took their leave, and departed to their own happier homes.The mourners, though not insensible to the kindness of their friends, had yearned to be left alone.United, as they had been, by the relationship of the living, and now more closely so by that of the dead, each felt as if whatever consolation her grief admitted were to be found in the bosom of the other.They joined their hearts, and wept together silently.But after an hour of such indulgence, one of the sisters, all of whose emotions were influenced by her mild, quiet, yet not feeble character, began to recollect the precepts of resignation and endurance which piety had taught her, when she did not think to need them.Her misfortune, besides, as earliest known, should earliest cease to interfere with her regular course of duties; accordingly, having placed the table before the fire, and arranged a frugal meal, she took the hand of her companion."
"“来吧，亲爱的妹妹，你今天一点儿东西都没吃呢，”她说道，“站起来吧，我求你了，让我们一起为这顿饭祈祷吧。”","“Come, dearest sister; you have eaten not a morsel today,” she said.“Arise, I pray you, and let us ask a blessing on that which is provided for us.”"
"她的弟媳性格泼辣、易怒，她刚听到噩耗时就大声尖叫、恸哭不已，以发泄自己的悲伤。现在，她就像一个受伤的人躲开一只抚慰她伤口的手一样，回避玛丽的话。","Her sister-in-law was of a lively and irritable temperament, and the first pangs of her sorrow had been expressed by shrieks and passionate lamentation.She now shrunk from Mary’s words, like a wounded sufferer from a hand that revives the throb."
"“没有什么祝福是留给我的了，我也不会再祈祷了！”玛格丽特大声喊道，又一股泪水夺眶而出，“但愿这是上帝的意愿，让我再也不碰任何食物了！”","“There is no blessing left for me, neither will I ask it!” cried Margaret, with a fresh burst of tears.“Would it were His will that I might never taste food more!”"
"然而，她几乎是刚一说出这些叛逆的话，身体就颤抖了起来。慢慢地，玛丽终于让她弟媳的心绪和自己的近乎同样平静了。时间在流逝，到了她们平常休息的时间。兄弟俩和她们的新娘结婚时没有多少财产，只能同意共住一套房子。两家共用一间客厅，客厅两侧的两间卧房则是各用一间。两位遗孀把灰烬堆在快要熄灭的余火上，点上一盏灯放在炉边，然后各自回房休息了。两间卧室的门都没关，床上的帷幔也没放下，这样她们彼此都可以看到对方室内的一部分和床。两人没有同时入睡。不幸经常会悄无声息地带来痛苦，玛丽承受着这种痛苦，很快就陷入了暂时的恍惚当中。而随着夜越来越深、越来越静，玛格丽特则变得愈发不安和焦躁。她躺在床上，听着雨水一滴一滴连续落下，声音十分单调，一阵风吹过，也没有产生任何影响。神经冲动使她不断地从枕头上抬起头来，朝玛丽的房间和中间的客厅望去。冷冷的灯光将家具的影子投射在墙上，影子印在墙上一动不动，只有在火焰突然闪烁时才动一下。两把空空的扶手椅摆放在壁炉两侧的老位置上。两兄弟作为一家之主，曾经习惯威严地坐在这里，他们朝气蓬勃、欢笑不断。两把稍显简陋的椅子摆在附近，它们才是这个小王国里真正的宝座，玛丽和她曾在这里满怀爱意地行使爱赋予她们的权力。那时，炉火欢快的光芒照着幸福的一家人，而现在静止的微弱灯光正适合他们团聚的氛围。当玛格丽特痛苦地呻吟时，她听到有人在敲临街的门。","Yet she trembled at these rebellious expressions, almost as soon as they were uttered, and, by degrees, Mary succeeded in bringing her sister’s mind nearer to the situation of her own.Time went on, and their usual hour of repose arrived.The brothers and their brides, entering the married state with no more than the slender means which then sanctioned such a step, had confederated themselves in one household, with equal rights to the parlor, and claiming exclusive privileges in two sleeping-rooms contiguous to it.Thither the widowed ones retired, after heaping ashes upon the dying embers of their fire, and placing a lighted lamp upon the hearth.The doors of both chambers were left open, so that a part of the interior of each, and the beds with their unclosed curtains, were reciprocally visible.Sleep did not steal upon the sisters at one and the same time.Mary experienced the effect often consequent upon grief quietly borne, and soon sunk into temporary forgetfulness, while Margaret became more disturbed and feverish, in proportion as the night advanced with its deepest and stillest hours.She lay listening to the drops of rain, that came down in monotonous succession, unswayed by a breath of wind; and a nervous impulse continually caused her to lift her head from the pillow, and gaze into Mary’s chamber and the intermediate apartment.The cold light of the lamp threw the shadows of the furniture up against the wall, stamping them immovably there, except when they were shaken by a sudden flicker of the flame.Two vacant arm-chairs were in their old positions on opposite sides of the hearth, where the brothers had been wont to sit in young and laughing dignity, as heads of families; two humbler seats were near them, the true thrones of that little empire, where Mary and herself had exercised in love a power that love had won.The cheerful radiance of the fire had shone upon the happy circle, and the dead glimmer of the lamp might have befitted their reunion now.While Margaret groaned in bitterness, she heard a knock at the street door."
"“如果是昨天，听到这敲门声，我的心该怎样怦怦直跳啊！”她想道，记起自己长期等待丈夫音讯时的焦急心情。","“How would my heart have leapt at that sound but yesterday!” thought she, remembering the anxiety with which she had long awaited tidings from her husband."
"“可我现在不在乎了，让他们走吧，因为我是不会起来的。”","“I care not for it now; let them begone, for I will not arise.”"
"然而，尽管一种孩子似的烦躁让她下定了决心，但她还是急促地呼吸着，竖起耳朵，听着不断传来的敲门声。我们将一些人视作另一个自己，这些人的离世总是让我们难以相信。现在，敲门声变成缓慢而有节奏的敲打，显然是将拳头握紧，用那柔软的拳头底部敲的。敲门声以外还传来说话声，只是隔了几堵墙，听不太清楚。玛格丽特朝玛丽的房间看了看，发现她仍睡得很沉。她起身，下了床，轻轻地穿上衣服。同时，因为既害怕又急切，身体颤抖了起来。","But even while a sort of childish fretfulness made her thus resolve, she was breathing hurriedly, and straining her ears to catch a repetition of the summons.It is difficult to be convinced of the death of one whom we have deemed another self.The knocking was now renewed in slow and regular strokes, apparently given with the soft end of a doubled fist, and was accompanied by words, faintly heard through several thicknesses of wall.Margaret looked to her sister’s chamber, and beheld her still lying in the depths of sleep.She arose, placed her foot upon the floor, and slightly arrayed herself, trembling between fear and eagerness as she did so."
"“上帝救救我吧！”她叹了一口气。“我没有什么好怕的，可怎么觉得自己比以前胆小了十倍。”","“Heaven help me!” sighed she.“I have nothing left to fear, and me thinks I am ten times more a coward than ever.”"
"她抓起炉边的灯，疾步走到能够俯瞰街门的那扇窗户旁。这是一扇有着铰链开关的花格窗；她向后打开窗户，把头稍稍探进湿润的空气中。一盏灯笼映红了屋子的正面，光渐渐消逝在周围的水洼里，其他东西则都笼罩在黑暗之中。就在窗户的铰链嘎吱作响时，一位戴着宽檐帽、穿着毛毡大衣的男子，从突出的楼层屋檐下走了出来，朝上张望，看看他的敲门声惊醒了谁。玛格丽特知道他是镇上一位很和气的旅店老板。","Seizing the lamp from the hearth, she hastened to the window that overlooked the street-door.It was a lattice, turning upon hinges; and having thrown it back, she stretched her head a little way into the moist atmosphere.A lantern was reddening the front of the house, and melting its light in the neighboring puddles, while a deluge of darkness overwhelmed every other object.As the window grated on its hinges, a man in a broad-brimmed hat and blanket-coat stepped from under the shelter of the projecting story, and looked upward to discover whom his application had aroused.Margaret knew him as a friendly innkeeper of the town."
"“古德曼·帕克先生，您有什么事吗？”这个寡妇大声问道。","“What would you have, Goodman Parker?” cried the widow."
"“真让人难过，玛格丽特小姐，是您吗？”旅店老板答道。“我还担心可能是您的嫂子玛丽，因为我可不愿看到遭遇不幸的年轻女子，而我又没有一句可以轻声安慰她的话。”","“Lackaday, is it you, Mistress Margaret?” replied the innkeeper.“I was afraid it might be your sister Mary; for I hate to see a young woman in trouble, when I haven’t a word of comfort to whisper her.”"
"“看在上帝的分上，您有什么消息吗？”玛格丽特尖叫道。","“For Heaven’s sake, what news do you bring?” screamed Margaret."
"“哎，半小时前，镇里来了一个信使，”古德曼·帕克说道，“他从东边的辖区过来，身上带着总督和政务委员会的信。他在我的旅店歇了一会儿，喝了点儿酒，吃了点儿食物，恢复了一下精力，我问了他前线有没有什么消息。他告诉我，我们赢了那场战斗，就是你知道的那次战斗。之前通报说战死的13人都安然无恙，其中就有你的丈夫。而且，他被派去把被俘的法国人和印度人押回到地区监狱。我想你应该不介意我打扰你休息，所以我就过来告诉你这个消息。晚安。”","“Why, there has been an express through the town within this half-hour,” said Goodman Parker, “travelling from the eastern jurisdiction with letters from the governor and council.He tarried at my house to refresh himself with a drop and a morsel, and I asked him what tidings on the frontiers.He tells me we had the better in the skirmish you wot of, and that thirteen men reported slain are well and sound, and your husband among them.Besides, he is appointed of the escort to bring the captivated Frenchers and Indians home to the province jail.I judged you wouldn’t mind being broke of your rest, and so I stepped over to tell you.Good night.”"
"说着，这个老实人就离开了。他的灯笼沿着街道发出微弱的光，显现出事物模糊的轮廓以及周围世界的碎片，就像秩序在混乱中露出微光，或是像记忆在过往中漫步。但是玛格丽特呆在这里，并不是为了欣赏这如画般的景象。快乐在心中闪烁，立刻照亮了她的心。她屏住呼吸，疾步如飞地跑到了嫂子的床边。可是，她在卧室门口停了下来，一股痛苦的思绪突然涌上心头。","So saying, the honest man departed; and his lantern gleamed along the street, bringing to view indistinct shapes of things, and the fragments of a world, like order glimmering through chaos, or memory roaming over the past.But Margaret stayed not to watch these picturesque effects.Joy flashed into her heart, and lighted it up at once; and breathless, and with winged steps, she flew to the bedside of her sister.She paused, however, at the door of the chamber, while a thought of pain broke in upon her."
"“可怜的玛丽！”她自言自语道，“我要叫醒她，让她因为我的幸福而感到更加悲伤吗？不，我要把这件事藏在心里，一直到明天。”","“Poor Mary!” said she to herself.“Shall I waken her, to feel her sorrow sharpened by my happiness?No; I will keep it within my own bosom till the morrow.”"
"她走到床边，看看玛丽是否睡得安稳。她曾把一部分脸埋进枕头里哭泣，不过现在可以看到她平静、安详的表情，就好像她的心是一个深湖，在死者沉入水底之后，又恢复了平静。虽然这的确让人高兴，但奇怪的是，梦主要是由那些减轻了的痛苦组成的。玛格丽特不愿打扰她的嫂子，她感觉自己转好的命运好像让她不由自主地变得不诚实了，好像她一说出这个消息，她们之间的感情就会发生变化，会变淡。她突然转身离开。但是，喜悦之情是无法被长期抑制的，即便在某些情况下，这种喜悦可能会在另一时刻引起沉重的悲伤之情。她满脑尽是喜悦之情，直到睡意袭来，喜悦之情变成了幻觉，变得更加令人愉快、更加狂野，犹如冬日里呼出的热气在窗户上形成奇妙的窗花一样（但这是多么阴冷的比喻！）。","She approached the bed, to discover if Mary’s sleep were peaceful.Her face was turned partly inward to the pillow, and had been hidden there to weep; but a look of motionless contentment was now visible upon it, as if her heart, like a deep lake, had grown calm because its dead had sunk down so far within.Happy is it, and strange, that the lighter sorrows are those from which dreams are chiefly fabricated.Margaret shrunk from disturbing her sister-in-law, and felt as if her own better fortune had rendered her involuntarily unfaithful, and as if altered and diminished affection must be the consequence of the disclosure she had to make.With a sudden step she turned away.But joy could not long be repressed, even by circumstances that would have excited heavy grief at another moment.Her mind was thronged with delightful thoughts, till sleep stole on, and transformed them to visions, more delightful and more wild, like the breath of winter (but what a cold comparison!) working fantastic tracery upon a window."
"夜越来越深，玛丽突然惊醒。她刚才在做一个梦，逼真的梦境把她带入了一个虚幻的世界，但是，她只记得梦做到最精彩的部分时被打断了。有那么一会儿，睡意像晨雾般笼罩着她，让她无法看到自身环境的清楚轮廓。她迷迷糊糊地听到两三下快而急促的敲门声一齐传来，刚开始，她没把这动静当回事，以为这就像自己吸气一样平常；接着，她又把这当作自己好像不关心的事；最后，她意识到自己必须去应门了。同时，回忆带来的剧痛向她的心中涌来，悲伤的脸上笼罩的睡意也散去了。她一睁开眼，卧室里微弱的光线和浮现的物品使她中断的思维回来了，并且恢复了。临街的门上再次响起一阵急促的敲门声。玛丽担心她的弟媳可能也被吵醒，就披上斗篷，戴上头巾，拿起炉旁的灯，疾步走到窗户边。窗户碰巧没关，她手一碰就开了。","When the night was far advanced, Mary awoke with a sudden start.A vivid dream had latterly involved her in its unreal life, of which, however, she could only remember that it had been broken in upon at the most interesting point.For a little time, slumber hung about her like a morning mist, hindering her from perceiving the distinct outline of her situation.She listened with imperfect consciousness to two or three volleys of a rapid and eager knocking; and first she deemed the noise a matter of course, like the breath she drew; next, it appeared a thing in which she had no concern; and lastly, she became aware that it was a summons necessary to be obeyed.At the same moment, the pang of recollection darted into her mind; the pall of sleep was thrown back from the face of grief; the dim light of the chamber, and the objects therein revealed, had retained all her suspended ideas, and restored them as soon as she unclosed her eyes.Again there was a quick peal upon the street-door.Fearing that her sister would also be disturbed, Mary wrapped herself in a cloak and hood, took the lamp from the hearth, and hastened to the window.By some accident, it had been left unhasped, and yielded easily to her hand."
"“谁在那里？”玛丽问道，她一边向外张望，一边哆嗦着。","“Who’s there?” asked Mary, trembling as she looked forth."
"暴风雨过后，月亮升起，月光照着天空中的残云，照着下面因潮湿而发黑的房屋，照着雨水积成的水洼。微风快速吹过，水洼里的雨水被激起，形成层层银色的涟漪。一个穿着水手服的年轻男子独自站在窗户下，他浑身湿漉漉的，仿佛刚从深海里出来。玛丽认出了他是一个在海边靠短航谋生的水手，她也不会忘记，在她结婚前，他曾追求过她，但并未成功。","The storm was over, and the moon was up; it shone upon broken clouds above, and below upon houses black with moisture, and upon little lakes of the fallen rain, curling into silver beneath the quick enchantment of a breeze.A young man in a sailor’s dress, wet as if he had come out of the depths of the sea, stood alone under the window.Mary recognized him as one whose livelihood was gained by short voyages along the coast; nor did she forget that, previous to her marriage, he had been an unsuccessful wooer of her own."
"“你来这里干吗，斯蒂芬？”她问道。","“What do you seek here, Stephen?” said she."
"“打起精神来，玛丽，我是来安慰你的，”这位曾遭她拒绝的爱慕者答道，“你要知道，我回家还不到十分钟，我母亲告诉我的第一件事就是你丈夫的事。所以，我还没跟老母亲说一句话就戴上帽子，跑出家门。玛丽，看在过去的情分，我不告诉你是睡不着觉的。”","“Cheer up, Mary, for I seek to comfort you,” answered the rejected lover.“You must know I got home not ten minutes ago, and the first thing my good mother told me was the news about your husband.So, without saying a word to the old woman, I clapped on my hat, and ran out of the house.I couldn’t have slept a wink before speaking to you, Mary, for the sake of old times.”"
"“斯蒂芬，我曾经把你想得太好了！”玛丽大声喊道，泪水喷涌而出。她准备关上花格窗，因为她根本不想效仿查第格的第一任妻子。","“Stephen, I thought better of you!” exclaimed the widow, with gushing tears and preparing to close the lattice; for she was no whit inclined to imitate the first wife of Zadig."
"“但是，等一下，听我把话说完，”年轻的水手大声喊道，“我告诉你，我们昨天下午说起了一艘从古老的英格兰来的双桅横帆船。你猜我看见谁站在甲板上了？他安然无恙，只是比五个月前瘦了一点儿。”","“But stop, and hear my story out,” cried the young sailor.“I tell you we spoke a brig yesterday afternoon, bound in from Old England.And who do you think I saw standing on deck, well and hearty, only a bit thinner than he was five months ago?”"
"玛丽斜靠在窗户上，却一句话也说不出来。“哎，那人正是你丈夫啊，”这位心胸宽广的水手继续说着，“翻船的时候，神护佑着他和另外三个人靠一根圆材救了自己。借着这风势，那艘双桅横帆船天亮就会到达这个海湾，你明天就能在这里见到他了。玛丽，这就是我带给你的安慰，晚安。”","Mary leaned from the window, but could not speak.“Why, it was your husband himself,” continued the generous seaman.“He and three others saved themselves on a spar, when the Blessing turned bottom upwards.The brig will beat into the bay by daylight, with this wind, and you’ll see him here tomorrow.There’s the comfort I bring you, Mary, and so good night.”"
"他急匆匆地走了，玛丽看着他的背影，对这一唤醒她的现实表示怀疑。随着他一会儿走入房屋的阴影处，一会儿出现在明亮的月光下，她的怀疑也忽而加深，忽而减弱。然而，一股幸福的洪流慢慢地涌进了她的心田，她相信了这个消息，要是这股洪流来势更猛一些，她就要被征服了。她第一个冲动的念头就是叫醒她的弟媳，告诉她这个刚刚得知的好消息。她推开卧室的门，房门在晚上被关上了，但没有闩上，她走到床边，正要把手搭在熟睡者的肩上。但这时，她想到玛格丽特醒后就会想到丈夫的离世，会感到悲伤，而这种悲伤并不会因为她自己的喜悦而有丝毫减轻。玛丽任凭灯光照在这个无意识的丧夫者身上。玛格丽特睡得并不安稳，她床上的帷帐没有放好。她年轻的脸颊透着淡淡的红润，双唇半启，露出生动的微笑，一丝喜悦的表情像香气般努力从脸上散发出来，却被紧闭的双睑阻隔在外。","He hurried away, while Mary watched him with a doubt of waking reality, that seemed stronger or weaker as he alternately entered the shade of the houses, or emerged into the broad streaks of moonlight.Gradually, however, a blessed flood of conviction swelled into her heart, in strength enough to overwhelm her, had its increase been more abrupt.Her first impulse was to rouse her sister-in-law, and communicate the new-born gladness.She opened the chamber-door, which had been closed in the course of the night, though not latched, advanced to the bedside, and was about to lay her hand upon the slumberer’s shoulder.But then she remembered that Margaret would awake to thoughts of death and woe, rendered not the less bitter by their contrast with her own felicity.She suffered the rays of the lamp to fall upon the unconscious form of the bereaved one.Margaret lay in unquiet sleep, and the drapery was displaced around her; her young cheek was rosy-tinted, and her lips half opened in a vivid smile; an expression of joy, debarred its passage by her sealed eyelids, struggled forth like incense from the whole countenance."
"“我可怜的弟媳！你很快就会从那个美梦中醒来的。”玛丽想道。","“My poor sister! you will waken too soon from that happy dream,” thought Mary."
"离开之前，她放下灯，尽力把被子掖好，不让寒气侵入这个兴奋的熟睡者。但是，她的手碰着玛格丽特的脖子时颤抖起来，而且一滴眼泪落在了她的脸颊上，于是，她突然醒了。","Before retiring, she set down the lamp, and endeavored to arrange the bedclothes so that the chill air might not do harm to the feverish slumberer.But her hand trembled against Margaret’s neck, a tear also fell upon her cheek, and she suddenly awoke."
