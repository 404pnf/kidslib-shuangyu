"作者：D. H. 劳伦斯","by D. H. Lawrence"
"一个男人从彭赞斯开往圣贾斯廷彭威斯的公交车上下了车，转向北方，朝着北极星的方向往山上走去。此时才刚六点半，却已是繁星满天，一股冷风从海面吹来，峭壁下灯塔水晶般的三脉冲闪光信号灯，在刚刚降临的夜色里有节奏地闪烁着。","A man got down from the motor-omnibus that runs from Penzance to St Just-in-Penwith, and turned northwards, uphill towards the Polestar.It was only half past six, but already the stars were out, a cold little wind was blowing from the sea, and the crystalline, three-pulse flash of the lighthouse below the cliffs beat rhythmically in the first darkness."
"男人只身一人。他毫不迟疑地赶着路，但还不时地带着小心翼翼的好奇心左顾右盼。已损坏的锡矿发电站高高矗立，在夜幕中若隐若现，好似昔日逝去的文明的残余。矿工们的小木屋散乱地分布在山坡上，屋里的灯在黑夜中闪着寂寥而无序的光，与凯尔特人夜晚孤寂的家常生活一起眨着眼睛。","The man was alone.He went his way unhesitating, but looked from side to side with cautious curiosity.Tall, ruined power-houses of tin-mines loomed in the darkness from time to time, like remnants of some by-gone civilization.The lights of many miners’ cottages scattered on the hilly darkness twinkled desolate in their disorder, yet twinkled with the lonely homeliness of the Celtic night."
"他稳步向前走着，警惕而又好奇。他个子高，身体结实，显然正值壮年。他的肩膀宽阔，相当挺拔，走路时躯干从臀部微微前倾，好像一个必须弯腰以降低自己的高度的男人。可他并没有缩着肩膀：从臀部到整个上身都是笔直的。","He tramped steadily on, always watchful with curiosity.He was a tall, well-built man, apparently in the prime of life.His shoulders were square and rather stiff, he leaned forwards a little as he went, from the hips, like a man who must stoop to lower his height.But he did not stoop his shoulders: he bent his straight back from the hips."
"矮矮的、敦实的、腿脚粗壮的科尼什矿工不时地与他擦肩而过，他总是给他们道晚安，似乎在强调这地方他是很熟悉的。他说话时带着西科尼什的腔调。他沿着这条阴沉的路往前走，一会儿看看陆地上房子里的灯光，一会儿瞧瞧远处海上的灯塔，大船一看见灯塔就改变了航向，望着夜色中的大西洋隔在自己和美洲之间，他似乎有点兴奋，感到愉快，谨慎与激动这两种情绪不停地转变着，冲突着。","Now and again short, stump, thick-legged figures of Cornish miners passed him, and he invariably gave them goodnight, as if to insist that he was on his own ground.He spoke with the west-Cornish intonation.And as he went along the dreary road, looking now at the lights of the dwellings on land, now at the lights away to sea, vessels veering round in sight of the Longships Lighthouse, the whole of the Atlantic Ocean in darkness and space between him and America, he seemed a little excited and pleased with himself, watchful, thrilled, veering along in a sense of mastery and of power in conflict."
"路边的房屋都开始关门了，他走进零乱无序的、萧瑟的矿村，他很久之前就知道这里。道路左边不远的一块空地上，有一家小酒馆透出温暖舒适的灯光。就是这里了。他凝视着酒馆的招牌：“锡矿工人之家”。但是他却辨认不出老板的名字。他听了听。屋里传来兴奋的笑谈声，一个女人的尖笑声混合在一群男人的声音里。","The houses began to close on the road, he was entering the straggling, formless, desolate mining village, that he knew of old.On the left was a little space set back from the road, and cosy lights of an inn.There it was.He peered up at the sign: ‘The Tinners’ Rest’.But he could not make out the name of the proprietor.He listened.There was excited talking and laughing, a woman’s voice laughing shrilly among the men’s."
"他微微弯腰，走进了这家灯光温暖的小酒吧。电灯明晃晃地亮着，一个丰满的女人从擦洗得发白的牌桌边站起身来，桌上散落着黑的、白的和红的纸牌，几个正在玩牌的矿工抬起头来。","Stooping a little, he entered the warmly-lit bar.The lamp was burning, a buxom woman rose from the white-scrubbed deal table where the black and white and red cards were scattered, and several men, miners, lifted their faces from the game."
"这个陌生人转过脸，径直走向柜台。他的帽子拉得很低，遮住了眉毛。","The stranger went to the counter, averting his face.His cap was pulled down over his brow."
"“晚上好！”老板娘逢迎谄媚地打着招呼。","‘Good-evening!’ said the landlady, in her rather ingratiating voice."
"“晚上好。来杯麦酒。”","‘Good-evening.A glass of ale.’"
"“麦酒一杯，”老板娘殷勤地重复着，“这夜晚真冷——不过却令人愉快。”","‘A glass of ale,’ repeated the landlady suavely.‘Cold night—but bright.’"
"“是的。”男人草草附和道。就在没有人指望他会再说点什么的时候，他又说道：“天气是时候变冷了。”","‘Yes,’ the man assented, laconically.Then he added, when nobody expected him to say any more: ‘Seasonable weather.’"
"“是时候了，没错。”老板娘回答，“谢谢你。”","‘Quite seasonable, quite,’ said the landlady.‘Thank you.’"
"男人端起酒杯直接送到嘴边，一口干了下去。咔嗒一声，他把酒杯放在镀锌的吧台上。","The man lifted his glass straight to his lips, and emptied it.He put it down again on the zinc counter with a click."
"“再来一杯。”他说。","‘Let’s have another,’ he said."
"女人又给他倒了杯酒，男人端起杯子朝靠近火炉的第二张桌子走去。女人迟疑了一下，又坐到牌桌边，回到牌友中间。她已经注意到这个男人了：一个身材高大、穿着得体的陌生人。","The woman drew the beer, and the man went away with his glass to the second table, near the fire.The woman, after a moment’s hesitation, took her seat again at the table with the card-players.She had noticed the man: a big fine fellow, well dressed, a stranger."
"但是他说话带着科尼什的北方士兵的口音，她则自然地将其当作是矿工们说话时常见的鼻音了。","But he spoke with that Cornish-Yankee accent she accepted as the natural twang among the miners."
"那个陌生人把脚放在围栏上，凝视着火苗。他相貌英俊，肤色红润，科尼什式的眉毛修饰得很好，还有一双明亮却没有神采的科尼什式的黑眼睛。他似乎想什么想得出神了。接着他看着这伙人打牌。","The stranger put his foot on the fender and looked into the fire.He was handsome, well coloured, with well-drawn Cornish eyebrows, and the usual dark, bright, mindless Cornish eyes.He seemed abstracted in thought.Then he watched the card-party."
"这个女人健康丰满，黑头发，有一双机敏的棕色小眼睛。她浑身散发着生机与活力，她将这股能量注入牌局，使男人们都兴奋起来，他们叫嚷，大笑，女人也用手托着胸部，尖声地大笑。","The woman was buxom and healthy, with dark hair and small, quick brown eyes.She was bursting with life and vigour, the energy she threw into the game of cards excited all the men, they shouted, and laughed, and the woman held her breast, shrieking with laughter."
"“噢，天哪，笑死我啦。”她喘着气说，“好了，你，特雷沃罗先生，别耍赖。别耍赖，我说，要不我可不玩儿了。”","‘Oh, my, it’ll be the death o’ me,’ she panted.‘Now, come on, Mr. Trevorrow, play fair.Play fair, I say, or I s’ll put the cards down.’"
"“谁耍赖！谁打牌耍赖？”特雷沃罗先生突然喊道，“你是在说我吗，我打牌不光明正大吗，南克维斯太太？”","‘Play fair!Why who’s played unfair?’ ejaculated Mr. Trevorrow.‘Do you mean t’accuse me, as I haven’t played fair, Mrs. Nankervis?’"
"“是的。我说了，而且我就是这个意思。难道你没有拿黑桃Ｑ吗？算了吧，别跟我躲躲闪闪地玩儿花招。我知道你拿着那张黑桃皇后呢，就像我知道自己叫艾丽斯一样。”","‘I do.I say it, and I mean it.Haven’t you got the queen of spades?Now, come on, no dodging round me.I know you’ve got that queen, as well as I know my name’s Alice.’"
"“好吧——如果你是艾丽斯，那你就把它拿去吧——”","‘Well—if your name’s Alice, you’ll have to have it—’"
"“哎呀，是吧——我说什么来着？你们见过这样的男人吗？我敢说，你老婆一定轻易就被你的表面给骗了。”","‘Ay, now—what did I say?Did you ever see such a man?My word, but your missus must be easy took in, by the looks of things.’"
"话音刚落，她就发出一阵大笑。四个穿着卡其布的男人进来打断了她，一个身材粗短的中年中士，一个年轻的下士和两个年轻的二等兵。女人靠到椅背上。","And off she went into peals of laughter.She was interrupted by the entrance of four men in khaki, a short, stumpy sergeant of middle age, a young corporal, and two young privates.The woman leaned back in her chair."
"“噢，我的天哪！”她喊道，“要是孩子们不是累得够呛地回来了，我相信……”","‘Oh, my!’ she cried.‘If there isn’t the boys back: looking perished, I believe—’"
"“累死了，夫人。”中士呼喊道，“还不算。”","‘Perished, Ma!’ exclaimed the sergeant.‘Not yet.’"
"“快死了。”一个年轻的二等兵笨拙地说。","‘Near enough,’ said a young private, uncouthly."
"女人站起身。","The woman got up."
"“我想也是，亲爱的们。你们一定想吃晚饭了，我去准备。”","‘I’m sure you are, my dears.You’ll be wanting your suppers, I’ll be bound.’"
"“我们还行。”","‘We could do with ’em.’"
"“先来点儿喝的吧。”中士说。","‘Let’s have a wet first,’ said the sergeant."
"女人赶紧去拿酒。几个士兵移到火旁，摊开他们的手。","The woman bustled about getting the drinks.The soldiers moved to the fire, spreading out their hands."
"“你们在这儿吃晚饭？”她说，“还是在厨房？”","‘Have your suppers in here, will you?’ she said.‘Or in the kitchen?’"
"“就在这儿吃吧。”中士说，“这儿更舒服——如果你不介意的话。”","‘Let’s have it here,’ said the sergeant.‘More cosier—if you don’t mind.’"
"“你们想在哪儿吃就在哪儿吃，伙计们。”","‘You shall have it where you like, boys, where you like.’"
"她一转眼就不见了。一会儿工夫，一个年纪约十六岁的女孩儿进来了。她身材高挑，面容清秀，一双年轻而没有表情的黑眼睛，眉毛整齐，带着尚未成熟的柔弱与无知，有一种凯尔特人独有的美。","She disappeared.In a minute a girl of about sixteen came in.She was tall and fresh, with dark, young, expressionless eyes, and well-drawn brows, and the immature softness and mindlessness of the sensuous Celtic type."
"“嗨，玛丽安！晚上好，玛丽安！玛丽安，你好吗？”一下传来了许多问候。","‘Ho, Maryann!Evenin’, Maryann!How’s Maryann, now?’ came the multiple greeting."
"她用柔弱的声音回答每个人，这声音很奇异，柔弱中带着从容镇静，很吸引人。她机械地走动着，样子却很迷人，好像她的思绪在别处。但她总是露出淡淡的恍惚的神态：一种微微的害羞。炉火旁的陌生人好奇地打量着她。他红润的脸上露出一种警惕、充满疑问而莽撞的好奇。","She replied to everybody in a soft voice, a strange, soft aplomb that was very attractive.And she moved round with rather mechanical, attractive movements, as if her thoughts were elsewhere.But she had always this dim far-awayness in her bearing: a sort of modesty.The strange man by the fire watched her curiously.There was an alert, inquisitive, mindless curiosity on his well-coloured face."
"“介意我和你们一起吃点儿晚饭吗？”他说。","‘I’ll have a bit of supper with you, if I might,’ he said."
"她看着他，眼睛清澈明亮，毫无理性，就像是某种动物的眼神。","She looked at him, with her clear, unreasoning eyes, just like the eyes of some non-human creature."
"“我问问妈妈。”她说。她的声音好似轻柔的呼吸，温柔的歌声。","‘I’ll ask mother,’ she said.Her voice was soft-breathing, gently singsong."
"当她再进来的时侯，说：","When she came in again:"
"“好的。”她说，几乎是在耳语，“你想吃点儿什么？”","‘Yes,’ she said, almost whispering.‘What will you have?’"
"“你们有什么呢？”他抬头看着她的脸，问道。","‘What have you got?’ he said, looking up into her face."
"“有冷肉——”","‘There’s cold meat—’"
"“那好，就给我冷肉吧。”","‘That’s for me, then.’"
"陌生人坐在桌子的一头，和几个疲惫不堪、默不作声的士兵一起吃饭。这会儿，老板娘对他产生了兴趣。她的眉头紧锁，健康而宽大的脸上露出恐慌的表情，可她棕色的小眼睛却紧紧地凝视着他。她是个大块头的女人，但是她的眼睛却又小又挤。她走近这个陌生人。她穿着一件相当花哨的法兰绒上衣和一条深色的裙子。","The stranger sat at the end of the table and ate with the tired, quiet soldiers.Now, the landlady was interested in him.Her brow was knit rather tense, there was a look of panic in her large, healthy face, but her small brown eyes were fixed most dangerously.She was a big woman, but her eyes were small and tense.She drew near the stranger.She wore a rather loud-patterned flannelette blouse, and a dark skirt."
"“吃饭时你想喝点儿什么？”她问，声音里带着一种新出现的危险的音调。","‘What will you have to drink with your supper?’ she asked, and there was a new, dangerous note in her voice."
"他不自在地动了一下。","He moved uneasily."
"“哦，再来点儿麦酒吧。”","‘Oh, I’ll go on with ale.’"
"她又给他倒了一杯。接着，她在他和士兵们吃饭的桌子边的长凳上坐下，盯着他。","She drew him another glass.Then she sat down on the bench at the table with him and the soldiers, and fixed him with her attention."
"“你从圣贾斯特来，是吗？”她说。","‘You’ve come from St Just, have you?’ she said."
"他用那清澈明亮、难以捉摸的科尼什黑眼睛盯着她，最后答道：","He looked at her with those clear, dark, inscrutable Cornish eyes, and answered at length:"
"“不，从彭赞斯来。”","‘No, from Penzance.’"
"“彭赞斯！——你今天晚上不打算回去了？”","‘Penzance!—but you’re not thinking of going back there tonight?’"
"“不——不回去了。”","‘No—no.’"
"他还是用那双清澈透亮、像玛瑙般明亮的大眼睛看着她。她开始发怒了。这从她的眉头能看出来。但她的声音还是那么温和，还有点不以为然。","He still looked at her with those wide, clear eyes that seemed like very bright agate.Her anger began to rise.It was seen on her brow.Yet her voice was still suave and deprecating."
"“我想也是——但你不住在这儿吧，对吗？”","‘I thought not—but you’re not living in these parts, are you?’"
"“是——是的，我不住这儿。”他总是回答得很慢，似乎在他和外来的提问之间有什么阻挡的东西。","‘No—no, I’m not living here.’He was always slow in answering, as if something intervened between him and any outside question."
"“噢，我明白了。”她说，“你在这儿有亲戚。”","‘Oh, I see,’ she said.‘You’ve got relations down here.’"
"他又一次直直地盯着她的眼睛，似乎想要看得她说不出话。","Again he looked straight into her eyes, as if looking her into silence."
"“有亲戚。”他说。","‘Yes,’ he said."
"他没再多接话。她烦躁地站了起来。怒上眉梢。尽管她继续母亲般地、温和地、好脾气地与男人们周旋，但那天晚上再也没有笑声和牌局了。他们都了解她，都怕她。","He did not say any more.She rose with a flounce.The anger was tight on her brow.There was no more laughing and card-playing that evening, though she kept up her motherly, suave, good-humoured way with the men.But they knew her, they were all afraid of her."
"晚饭吃过了，桌子也收拾了，陌生男人还是没有走。两个年轻的士兵快活地去睡觉了：","The supper was finished, the table cleared, the stranger did not go.Two of the young soldiers went off to bed, with their cheery:"
"“晚安，夫人。晚安，玛丽安。”","‘Good-night, Ma.Good-night, Maryann.’"
"这个陌生男人和中士聊了几句关于战争的话题，这是开战的第一年，他们聊起新的部队，一支驻扎在本地区的小分队，聊起了美国。","The stranger talked a little to the sergeant about the war, which was in its first year, about the new army, a fragment of which was quartered in this district, about America."
"老板娘的小眼睛瞪着他，一分钟接一分钟，一股狂躁的风暴在她的胸中涌动，因为他仍然没有走。因为压抑着强烈的感情，她全身颤抖，那是一种让人害怕且不同寻常的情绪。她一刻也坐不住了。时间一分一秒地过去，她沉重的身躯似乎不自觉地闪来闪去，挪来挪去，可是，他还是坐在那儿，她内心的不安渐渐地变得无法忍受。她看着时钟的指针移动。士兵中有三个都已经睡觉去了，只有那个剪着平头、长得像小狗崽的老中士还留在那儿。","The landlady darted looks at him from her small eyes, minute by minute the electric storm welled in her bosom, as still he did not go.She was quivering with suppressed, violent passion, something frightening and abnormal.She could not sit still for a moment.Her heavy form seemed to flash with sudden, involuntary movements as the minutes passed by, and still he sat there, and the tension on her heart grew unbearable.She watched the hands of the dock move on.Three of the soldiers had gone to bed, only the crop-headed, terrier-like old sergeant remained."
"老板娘坐在吧台后面，烦躁不安地不停地翻着报纸。她又看了看时钟。终于，只差五分钟就到十点了。","The landlady sat behind the bar fidgeting spasmodically with the newspaper.She looked again at the clock.At last it was five minutes to ten."
"“先生们——冤家！”她说，语气中的烦躁减弱了些。“请注意时间。该打烊了，亲爱的们。祝你们晚安！”","‘Gentlemen—the enemy!’ she said, in her diminished, furious voice.‘Time, please.Time, my dears.And good-night all!’"
"男人们开始离开了，简单地道着晚安。只差一分钟到十点了。老板娘站了起来。","The men began to drop out, with a brief good-night.It was a minute to ten.The landlady rose."
"“快。”她说，“我要关门了。”","‘Come,’ she said.‘I’m shutting the door.’"
"最后几个矿工走出去了。她杵在那儿，坚决而充满威胁地扶着门。那陌生人仍然坐在火旁，黑色的外衣敞开着，吸着烟。","The last of the miners passed out.She stood, stout and menacing, holding the door.Still the stranger sat on by the fire, his black overcoat opened, smoking."
"“我们马上要关门了，先生。”老板娘用危险但压制着的声音说道。","‘We’re closed now, sir,’ came the perilous, narrowed voice of the landlady."
"这个小个子的、长得像小狗崽的、固执的中士碰了碰陌生人的手臂。","The little, dog-like, hard-headed sergeant touched the arm of the stranger."
"“时间到了，打烊了。”他说。","‘Closing time,’ he said."
"坐着的陌生人转过身来，他宝石般的黑眼睛快速地从中士移到老板娘的身上。","The stranger turned round in his seat, and his quick-moving, dark, jewel-like eyes went from the sergeant to the landlady."
"“我今晚就留在这儿了。”他说，带着简洁的科尼什北方士兵的口音。","‘I’m stopping here tonight,’ he said, in his laconic Cornish-Yankee accent."
"老板娘似乎要气炸了。她的眼睛奇怪地睁着，十分可怕。","The landlady seemed to tower.Her eyes lifted strangely, frightening."
"“啊！真的吗！”她大喊，“哦，真的吗！我倒要问问，这是谁的命令？”","‘Oh!indeed!’ she cried.‘Oh, indeed!And whose orders are those, may I ask?’"
"他又看着她。","He looked at her again."
"“我的命令。”他说。","‘My orders,’ he said."
"她不自觉地顺手关掉门，像一只危险的大鸟冲了过去。她提高了嗓门，声音有些沙哑。","Involuntarily she shut the door, and advanced like a great, dangerous bird.Her voice rose, there was a touch of hoarseness in it."
"“你的命令算什么，说说看？”她喊道，“你算老几，在这间屋子里发号施令？”","‘And what might your orders be, if you please?’ she cried.‘Who might you be, to give orders, in the house?’"
"他还是一动不动地坐着，看着她。","He sat still, watching her."
"“你知道我是谁。”他说，“至少，我知道你是谁。”","‘You know who I am,’ he said.‘At least, I know who you are.’"
"“哦，是吗？哦，你知道？那我是谁？你行行好，能告诉我吗？”","‘Oh, you do?Oh, do you?And who am I then, if you’ll be so good as to tell me?’"
"他用黑亮的眼睛盯着她。","He stared at her with his bright, dark eyes."
"“你是我老婆，没错。”他说，“你和我一样清楚。”","‘You’re my Missis, you are,’ he said.‘And you know it, as well as I do.’"
"她吃了一惊，好像什么东西从她身体里炸开了。","She started as if something had exploded in her."
"她的眼睛鼓起，火冒三丈，发疯了一般。","Her eyes lifted and flared madly."
"“难道！我知道吗！”她喊道，“我根本不知道有这回事！我根本不知道有这回事！你以为一个男人走进这间酒馆，随便地说我是他的老婆，我就会相信他？——我告诉你，不管你是谁，你搞错了。我自己知道，我不是你老婆，劳驾你，在我找人把你轰出去之前，请你立刻离开这间屋子。”","‘Do I know it, indeed!’ she cried.‘I know no such thing!I know no such thing!Do you think a man’s going to walk into this bar, and tell me off-hand I’m his Missis, and I’m going to believe him?—I say to you, whoever you may be, you’re mistaken.I know myself for no Missis of yours, and I’ll thank you to go out of this house, this minute, before I get those that will put you out.’"
"男人站起来，把头微微地靠向她。他是个体格健硕的科尼什人，正当壮年。","The man rose to his feet, stretching his head towards her a little.He was a handsomely built Cornishman in the prime of life."
"“你说什么，呃？你不认识我了？”他说，他的声音起伏，虽不露情感，却有一种压迫感令人窒息：这让人想起了那个女孩儿的声音。“不管在哪儿，我都得认出你来，你明白吧。我应该认出你！我第一眼就能认出你了，你看。你知道吗，啊，知道吗？”","‘What you say, eh?You don’t know me?’ he said, in his sing-song voice, emotionless, but rather smothered and pressing: it reminded one of the girl’s.‘I should know you anywhere, you see.I should!I shouldn’t have to look twice to know you, you see.You see, now, don’t you?’"
"这女人感到非常迷惑。","The woman was baffled."
"“你可以这么说，”她断断续续地回答，“你可以这么说。这很简单。方圆十里的人都知道我的名字，大家都很敬重我。可是，我不认识你。”","‘So you may say,’ she replied, staccato.‘So you may say.That’s easy enough.My name’s known, and respected, by most people for ten miles round.But I don’t know you.’"
"她的语调变得嘲讽起来。“我不能说我认识你。你对我来说完全是个陌生人，而且我也确信，在今晚之前，我从没见过你。”","Her voice ran to sarcasm.‘I can’t say I know you.You’re a perfect stranger to me, and I don’t believe I’ve ever set eyes on you before tonight.’"
"她语气多变，而且带着讽刺。","Her voice was very flexible and sarcastic."
"“不，你见过我。”男人理智地回答，“你见过我。你的姓就是我的姓，还有那姑娘玛丽安就是我的女儿，她是我的女儿。你就是我老婆，绝对没错。就像我确定我就是威利·南克维斯一样。”","‘Yes, you have,’ replied the man, in his reasonable way.‘Yes, you have.Your name’s my name, and that girl Maryann is my girl; she’s my daughter.You’re my Missis right enough.As sure as I’m Willie Nankervis.’"
"他说得好像一切都是公认的事实那样。他的脸很帅气，带着一种奇怪的警觉，而且他对自己的信念非常坚定，这使她发狂。","He spoke as if it were an accepted fact.His face was handsome, with a strange, watchful alertness and a fundamental fixity of intention that maddened her."
"“你这恶棍！”她叫喊道，“你这恶棍，敢到这屋里来这样对我说话。你这恶棍，你简直就是无赖！”","‘You villain!’ she cried.‘You villain, to come to this house and dare to speak to me.You villain, you down-right rascal!’"
"他看着她。","He looked at her."
"“嘿。”他无动于衷地说，“够了吧。”在她面前，他有点不自在。只是，他不怕她。在他身上有些让人看不穿的东西，就像他的眼睛一样，像玛瑙一样耀眼。","‘Ay,’ he said, unmoved.‘All that.’He was uneasy before her.Only he was not afraid of her.There was something impenetrable about him, like his eyes, which were as bright as agate."
"她气得跳起来，充满威胁地走近他。","She towered, and drew near to him menacingly."
"“你快出去，走不走?”——她突然发疯地跺着脚，“马上离开！”","‘You’re going out of this house, aren’t you?’—She stamped her foot in sudden madness.‘This minute!’"
"他看着她。他知道她想揍他了。","He watched her.He knew she wanted to strike him."
"“不，”他说，压制着强调的口吻。“我已经告诉你了，我就留在这儿。”","‘No,’ he said, with suppressed emphasis.‘I’ve told you, I’m stopping here.’"
"他惧怕她的个性，但这并没使他改变。她颤抖了一下。她那黄褐色的小眼睛聚合着强烈的、隐形的怒火，就像一只愤怒的老虎。男人在畏缩，但仍站着没有动。此时她想了想。她要去找人来。","He was afraid of her personality, but it did not alter him.She wavered.Her small, tawny-brown eyes concentrated in a point of vivid, sightless fury, like a tiger’s.The man was wincing, but he stood his ground.Then she bethought herself.She would gather her forces."
"“我倒要看看你是不是要留在这儿。”她说。接着，她鼓着奇怪的令人害怕的眼睛，转身冲出了房间。这个男人听见她上楼，听见她敲了一间卧室的门，听见她说：“你们能下来一会儿吗，伙计们？我需要你们。我遇到麻烦了。”","‘We’ll see whether you’re stopping here,’ she said.And she turned, with a curious, frightening lifting of her eyes, and surged out of the room.The man, listening, heard her go upstairs, heard her tapping at a bedroom door, heard her saying: ‘Do you mind coming down a minute, boys?I want you.I’m in trouble.’"
"酒馆里的这个男人摘下他的帽子，脱下他的黑外套，把它们扔到他后面的座位上。他的黑头发很短，鬓角处有点儿灰白的头发。他穿着一件深灰色的美式翻领西装，西装剪裁精良，穿上去很合体。他看来很有钱，身体结实健康。他的肩膀看上去相当僵硬，那是因为在矿井中工作时，他的锁骨断过两次。","The man in the bar took off his cap and his black overcoat, and threw them on the seat behind him.His black hair was short and touched with grey at the temples.He wore a well-cut, well-fitting suit of dark grey, American in style, and a turn-down collar.He looked well-to-do, a fine, solid figure of a man.The rather rigid look of the shoulders came from his having had his collar-bone twice broken in the mines."
"这个像小狗崽一样、穿着脏兮兮的卡其布军服的中士偷偷地看着他。","The little terrier of a sergeant, in dirty khaki, looked at him furtively."
"“她是你老婆？”他朝女人离开的方向扭了一下头，问道。","‘She’s your Missis?’ he asked, jerking his head in the direction of the departed woman."
"“是的，她是。”男人咆哮着，“她就是，我确信。”","‘Yes, she is,’ barked the man.‘She’s that, sure enough.’"
"“很久没见她了，是吧？”","‘Not seen her for a long time, haven’t ye?’"
"“到三月份就整整十六年了。”","‘Sixteen years come March month.’"
"“唔！”","‘Hm!’"
"中士很快就又继续开始吸烟。","And the sergeant laconically resumed his smoking."
"老板娘回来了，跟着三个年轻的士兵，他们进来的时候相当羞怯，穿着裤子，衬衫和袜子，却没穿鞋。女人装腔作势地站在酒馆的一头，大声叫喊着：","The landlady was coming back, followed by the three young soldiers, who entered rather sheepishly, in trousers and shirt and stocking-feet.The woman stood histrionically at the end of the bar, and exclaimed:"
"“这男人拒绝离开这间屋子，他声称要在这儿过夜。你们都十分清楚我这儿没有空床了，对吧？而且这屋子从不给旅客提供住宿。尽管如此，他还是要死皮赖脸地留在这儿！但是只要我还有一滴血，还有最后一口气，我都不会同意的。要是你们还算是名副其实的男人，那就帮帮这个没人帮忙的女人吧。”","‘That man refuses to leave the house, claims he’s stopping the night here.You know very well I have no bed, don’t you?And this house doesn’t accommodate travellers.Yet he’s going to stop in spite of all!But not while I’ve a drop of blood in my body, that I declare with my dying breath.And not if you men are worth the name of men, and will help a woman as has no one to help her.’"
"她眼睛闪着光，脸也涨红了。她笔直地站着，像一名亚马孙女战士一般。","Her eyes sparkled, her face was flushed pink.She was drawn up like an Amazon."
"年轻的士兵们不知道应该怎么办。他们看着这个男人，又看着中士，其中一个低下头系紧了裤子背带，扣在第二颗纽扣上。","The young soldiers did not quite know what to do.They looked at the man, they looked at the sergeant, one of them looked down and fastened his braces on the second button."
"“怎么回事，中士？”其中一个士兵恶作剧地问道，脸上闪着光。","‘What say, sergeant?’ asked one whose face twinkled for a little devilment."
"“这男人说他是南克维斯太太的丈夫。”中士回答。","‘Man says he’s husband to Mrs. Nankervis,’ said the sergeant."
"“他不是我丈夫。我声明，今晚之前我从未见过他。这是个龌龊的伎俩，没别的，龌龊的伎俩。”","‘He’s no husband of mine.I declare I never set eyes on him before this night.It’s a dirty trick, nothing else, it’s a dirty trick.’"
"“什么，你这谎话精，说你之前从未见过我。”男人靠近壁炉，大声地咆哮着。“你嫁给我了，还有那个女孩儿玛丽安是你和我生的——这你相当清楚。”","‘Why, you’re a liar, saying you never set eyes on me before,’ barked the man near the hearth.‘You’re married to me, and that girl Maryann you had by me—well enough you know it.’"
"年轻的士兵们兴奋地看着，中士冷静地抽着烟。","The young soldiers looked on in delight, the sergeant smoked imperturbed."
"“是。”老板娘唱歌似的回答，极具嘲讽地慢慢晃着脑袋，“听起来不赖，是吧？但你看着吧，我们一个字也不相信，你怎么证明？”她狡猾地笑了笑。","‘Yes,’ sang the landlady, slowly shaking her head in supreme sarcasm, ‘it sounds very pretty, doesn’t it?But you see we don’t believe a word of it, and how are you going to prove it?’She smiled nastily."
"男人看着她，沉默了一会儿，然后他说：","The man watched in silence for a moment, then he said:"
"“不用证明。”","‘It wants no proof.’"
"“哦，是吗？但是需要证明。哦，需要，可这需要证明，先生，需要很多证据！”女人带着讥讽唱歌式地回应着。“我们可不是那种傻瓜，把你说的都信以为真。”","‘Oh, yes, but it does!Oh, yes, but it does, sir, it wants a lot of proving!’ sang the lady’s sarcasm.‘We’re not such gulls as all that, to swallow your words whole.’"
"可是，他站在炉火边一动不动。她把手搭在镀锌的吧台上，站在那儿，中士跷着二郎腿，坐在他们两人中间吸烟，三个年轻的士兵只穿着衬衫和背带，站在吧台后面的暗处，冷得一直打颤。屋里一片沉寂。","But he stood unmoved near the fire.She stood with one hand resting on the zinc-covered bar, the sergeant sat with legs crossed, smoking, on the seat halfway between them, the three young soldiers in their shirts and braces stood wavering in the gloom behind the bar.There was silence."
"“南克维斯太太，你知道任何关于你丈夫的下落吗？他还活着吗？”中士审慎地问道。","‘Do you know anything of the whereabouts of your husband, Mrs. Nankervis?Is he still living?’ asked the sergeant, in his judicious fashion."
"突然，老板娘开始嚎啕大哭，热泪满面，把年轻的士兵吓呆了。","Suddenly the landlady began to cry, great scalding tears, that left the young men aghast."
"“我对他一无所知。”她哽咽着，把手伸进口袋里摸手帕，“玛丽安还是个婴儿的时候，他就离我而去了，他到美国去开矿，之后大约半年的时间里从未给我写过一个字，也没有寄过一分钱。我不知道他是死是活，这个恶棍。我听说的都是关于他的坏消息——而现在我好几年都没有听到关于他的消息了。”她使劲地抽泣。","‘I know nothing of him,’ she sobbed, feeling for her pocket handkerchief.‘He left me when Maryann was a baby, went mining to America, and after about six months never wrote a line nor sent me a penny bit.I can’t say whether he’s alive or dead, the villain.All I’ve heard of him’s to the bad—and I’ve heard nothing for years an’ all, now.’She sobbed violently."
"在她痛哭的时候，那有着古铜肤色、长相帅气的男人站在火旁边看着她。他惊恐不已，苦恼而又迷惑，但没有一种情感能动摇他的内心。","The golden-skinned, handsome man near the fire watched her as she wept.He was frightened, he was troubled, he was bewildered, but none of his emotions altered him underneath."
"房间里一片寂静，只听到老板娘在嚎啕大哭。男人们全都被震慑住了。","There was no sound in the room but the violent sobbing of the landlady.The men, one and all, were overcome."
"“你不认为你今晚最好离开？”中士好言好语、通情达理地对男人说，“你最好离开一会儿，再处理你们之间的事情。我想，如果真是她说的那样，你不能对一个女人要求太多。而且，你回来看她，也太突然了。”","‘Don’t you think as you’d better go, for tonight?’ said the sergeant to the man, with sweet reasonableness.‘You’d better leave it a bit, and arrange something between you.You can’t have much claim on a woman, I should imagine, if it’s how she says.And you’ve come down on her a bit too sudden-like.’"
"老板娘哭得撕心裂肺。男人看着她丰满的胸部在抖动。它们似乎对他的大脑施了魔法。","The landlady sobbed heart-brokenly.The man watched her large breasts shaken.They seemed to cast a spell over his mind."
"“我怎么对她已经不重要了。”他答道，“我已经回来了，并且我要留在我的家里——无论如何，就一会儿也好。你明白了吧。”","‘How I’ve treated her, that’s no matter,’ he replied.‘I’ve come back, and I’m going to stop in my own home—for a bit, anyhow.There you’ve got it.’"
"“这是卑鄙行为。”中士说，脸气得通红，愤怒不已。“真是卑鄙，怎么，抛弃一个女人这么多年以后，你还想勉强她接受你吗！卑鄙行为——法律也不允许这样。”","‘A dirty action,’ said the sergeant, his face flushing dark.‘A dirty action, to come, after deserting a woman for that number of years, and want to force yourself on her!A dirty action—as isn’t allowed by the law.’"
"老板娘擦干眼泪。","The landlady wiped her eyes."
"“管你什么法律不法律。”男人用一种出奇强硬的声音吼道，“我今晚不打算离开这酒馆了。”","‘Never you mind about law nor nothing,’ cried the man, in a strange, strong voice.‘I’m not moving out of this public tonight.’"
"女人转身对着她后面的士兵，带着挖苦和哄骗的口吻说：","The woman turned to the soldiers behind her, and said in a wheedling, sarcastic tone:"
"“我们打算忍受这个吗，伙计们？——我们就这样算了，托马斯中士，一个无赖，一个横行霸道的家伙，抛弃了妻子和襁褓中的婴儿，任由她自己挣扎求生，在美国矿区过着不值一提的日子，现在回来后还想破坏一个穷女人的生活，抢夺她的财物？要是没有人站出来为我出头，那真是丢脸——丢脸到家了——！”","‘Are we going to stand it, boys?—Are we going to be done like this, Sergeant Thomas, by a scoundrel and a bully as has led a life beyond mention, in those American mining-camps, and then wants to come back and make havoc of a poor woman’s life and savings, after having left her with a baby in arms to struggle as best she might?It’s a crying shame if nobody will stand up for me—a crying shame—!’"
"士兵们和小个子中士被激怒了。女人弯着腰，在柜台下面乱翻了一阵。然后，趁着站在炉火边的男人不注意的时候，她把一根打包用的拧成一股的草绳扔在吧台后面的暗处，士兵的脚跟前。","The soldiers and the little sergeant were bristling.The woman stooped and rummaged under the counter for a minute.Then, unseen to the man away near the fire, she threw out a plaited grass rope, such as is used for binding bales, and left it lying near the feet of the young soldiers, in the gloom at the back of the bar."
"接着，她站起身，正视着眼前的局面。","Then she rose and fronted the situation."
"“走吧。”她用理智、冷漠而又略带哄骗的口吻对男人说，“把衣服穿上走吧。像个男人样，不要比德国畜牲还可恶。在圣贾斯特你很容易就能找到一张床过夜，如果你没钱，中士会借给你几先令的，我保证他会给你。”","‘Come now,’ she said to the man, in a reasonable, coldly-coaxing tone, ‘put your coat on and leave us alone.Be a man, and not worse than a brute of a German.You can get a bed easy enough in St Just, and if you’ve nothing to pay for it sergeant would lend you a couple of shillings, I’m sure he would.’"
"所有人的眼睛都注视着这个男人。他正低着头，盯着这个女人，好像着了魔或是被某个魔鬼故意施了魔咒的动物。","All eyes were fixed on the man.He was looking down at the woman like a creature spell-bound or possessed by some devil’s own intention."
"“我自己有钱。”他说，“你不要因为你的钱而害怕，眼下，我有的是钱。”","‘I’ve got money of my own,’ he said.‘Don’t you be frightened for your money, I’ve plenty of that, for the time.’"
"“那好。”女人哄骗地说道，冷漠中带着嘲讽和安抚，“把你的衣服穿上，爱上哪儿上哪儿——像个男人样，别做个德国畜牲。”","‘Well, then,’ she coaxed, in a cold, almost sneering propitiation, ‘put your coat on and go where you’re wanted—be a man, not a brute of a German.’"
"她带着挑衅和哄骗的意图，朝他走去。他低头看着她，脸上一副陶醉的神情。","She had drawn quite near to him, in her challenging coaxing intentness.He looked down at her with his bewitched face."
"“不，我不走。”他说，“我不会那样做。今晚你得留我住下。”","‘No, I shan’t,’ he said.‘I shan’t do no such thing.You’ll put me up for tonight.’"
"“我留你？！”她大声叫嚷着。突然，她抡起胳膊勒住他，全身的重量吊在他身上，朝士兵们喊道：“快拿绳子，伙计们，把他给捆上。艾尔弗雷德——约翰，快啊——”","‘Shall I!’ she cried.And suddenly she flung her arms round him, hung on to him with all her powerful weight, calling to the soldiers: ‘Get the rope, boys, and fasten him up.Alfred—John, quick now—’"
"男人站直身体，发疯似的环视四周，全身用力挣扎。可是，这女人力气也不小，而且她很重，下定决心要死死抓住他。她那欣喜而可怕的报复表情出现在他的面前；他疯狂地向后转头，想要摆脱这样的神情。与此同时，年轻的士兵们看着这可怕的“拉奥孔”左右摆动，过了一阵，他们才忙乱起来，那个心怀恶意的士兵拿着绳子飞快地冲了过去。绳子有点拧了。","The man reared, looked round with maddened eyes, and heaved his powerful body.But the woman was powerful also, and very heavy, and was clenched with the determination of death.Her face, with its exulting, horribly vindictive look, was turned up to him from his own breast; he reached back his head frantically, to get away from it.Meanwhile the young soldiers, after having watched this frightful Laocoon swaying for a moment, stirred, and the malicious one darted swiftly with the rope.It was tangled a little."
"“把那头给我。”中士喊道。","‘Give me the end here,’ cried the sergeant."
"此时，这个大个子男人喘着粗气使劲挣扎，用他的爆发力将女人甩来甩去，打翻了椅子和桌子，想获得自由。但她就像乌贼一样用力地缠着他的胳臂。他喘着气左右挣扎，他们在屋里东撞西撞，士兵们跳来跳去，家具也被撞得东倒西歪。","Meanwhile the big man heaved and struggled, swung the woman round against the seat and the table, in his convulsive effort to get free.But she pinned down his arms like a cuttlefish wreathed heavily upon him.And he heaved and swayed, and they crashed about the room, the soldiers hopping, the furniture bumping."
"年轻的士兵已经把绳子绕了一圈，中士敏捷地帮着他。女人使劲将身体一沉，他们把绳子捆了好几圈。在挣扎中，这个受害者跌倒在桌子上。他们狠狠地勒紧绳子，直到他的胳臂一动不能动。这个女人抓住他的膝盖。另一个士兵灵机一动，用一副背带把这个陌生男人的脚绑住了。椅子被撞得东倒西歪，桌子也被推到了墙边，可这男人被绑住了，他的胳臂贴在身体两边，脚也是捆着的。他半躺着靠在桌子边，安静了一会儿。","The young soldier had got the rope once round, the brisk sergeant helping him.The woman sank heavily lower, they got the rope round several times.In the struggle the victim fell over against the table.The ropes tightened till they cut his arms.The woman clung to his knees.Another soldier ran in a flash of genius, and fastened the strange man’s feet with the pair of braces.Seats had crashed over, the table was thrown against the wall, but the man was bound, his arms pinned against his sides, his feet tied.He lay half fallen, sunk against the table, still for a moment."
"女人站起来，觉得有点眩晕，又坐在了靠墙的椅子上。她的胸部剧烈地起伏着，一句话也说不出来，她以为自己快死了。这个被绑着的男人躺在被掀翻的桌子上，他的衣服在绳子缠绕下扭曲着，腰部也露了出来。士兵们站在四周，有点茫然，但却因为这场打斗而感到兴奋。","The woman rose, and sank, faint, on to the seat against the wall.Her breast heaved, she could not speak, she thought she was going to die.The bound man lay against the overturned table, his coat all twisted and pulled up beneath the ropes, leaving the loins exposed.The soldiers stood around, a little dazed, but excited with the row."
"男人又开始挣扎，本能地鼓着气，想把绳子挣断，使劲地吸气。他古铜色的脸因过于用力而涨得通红，可他还是继续吸气。他脖子上的血管暴起。但却没有用，他休息了一下。接着，他又开始了，猛地把脚挣脱了。","The man began to struggle again, heaving instinctively against the ropes, taking great, deep breaths.His face, with its golden skin, flushed dark and surcharged, he heaved again.The great veins in his neck stood out.But it was no good, he went relaxed.Then again, suddenly, he jerked his feet."
"“再拿一副背带来，威廉。”激动的士兵大声喊道。他用自己的身体压在这个绑着的男人的腿上，捆住了他的膝盖。屋里又是一片沉寂。他们能听见钟表的滴答声。","‘Another pair of braces, William,’ cried the excited soldier.He threw himself on the legs of the bound man, and managed to fasten the knees.Then again there was stillness.They could hear the clock tick."
"女人看着这个倒在地上的人，强壮笔直的四肢，被绑着的强壮的后背，那张长着大眼睛的脸，使她想起了捆在麻袋里装载在车上的牛犊子，只能安静地向后伸脑袋。终于，她胜利了。","The woman looked at the prostrate figure, the strong, straight limbs, the strong back bound in subjection, the wide-eyed face that reminded her of a calf tied in a sack in a cart, only its head stretched dumbly backwards.And she triumphed."
"被绑住的男人又开始挣扎。她入神地看着他的肌肉在活动，肩膀，臀部，粗壮干净的大腿。即便是这会儿，他还有可能挣断绳子。她有点害怕。但这个充满活力的年轻士兵坐在了这个被绑住的男人的肩膀上，经过片刻的危险，又是一片沉静。","The bound-up body began to struggle again.She watched fascinated the muscles working, the shoulders, the hips, the large, clean thighs.Even now he might break the ropes.She was afraid.But the lively young soldier sat on the shoulders of the bound man, and after a few perilous moments, there was stillness again."
"“现在，”中士谨慎地对绑着的男人说，“如果我们把你松开，你得保证马上离开并且不再来找麻烦。”","‘Now,’ said the judicious sergeant to the bound man, ‘if we untie you, will you promise to go off and make no more trouble.’"
"“你们不能在这儿把他给放了。”女人喊道，“我可不相信他，到这份儿上，我都能揍他一顿。”","‘You’ll not untie him in here,’ cried the woman.‘I wouldn’t trust him as far as I could blow him.’"
"一阵沉默。","There was silence."
"“我们可以把他抬到外面，然后松开他。”一个士兵说，“要是他再惹麻烦，我们就叫警察。”","‘We might carry him outside, and undo him there,’ said the soldier.‘Then we could get the policeman, if he made any bother.’"
"“好的。”中士说，“我们就这样办。”之后，他改变了口气，用严厉语调对这个犯人说：“如果我们在外面把你放了，你会拿着你的衣服离开，不再捣乱吗？”","‘Yes,’ said the sergeant.‘We could do that.’Then again, in an altered, almost severe tone, to the prisoner.‘If we undo you outside, will you take your coat and go without creating any more disturbance?’"
"但这犯人不回答，他只是躺着，明亮的黑眼睛睁得大大的，像一只被缚的动物。又是一阵说不清的沉默。","But the prisoner would not answer, he only lay with wide, dark, bright, eyes, like a bound animal.There was a space of perplexed silence."
"“那好吧，就照你们说的做吧。”女人恼火地说，“你们把他抬出去，然后我们关门。”","‘Well, then, do as you say,’ said the woman irritably.‘Carry him out amongst you, and let us shut up the house.’"
"他们照办了。四个士兵把绑着的男人抬起来，笨拙而蹒跚地走到小酒馆前方安静的广场上，女人拿着帽子和大衣跟在后面。年轻的士兵们快速地从犯人的腿上解开背带，跳进屋里。他们只穿着袜子，外面的星星冰冷地闪烁着。他们站在门口看着。男人躺在冷冰冰的地上一动不动。","They did so.Picking up the bound man, the four soldiers staggered clumsily into the silent square in front of the inn, the woman following with the cap and the overcoat.The young soldiers quickly unfastened the braces from the prisoner’s legs, and they hopped indoors.They were in their stocking-feet, and outside the stars flashed cold.They stood in the doorway watching.The man lay quite still on the cold ground."
"“现在，”中士压低声音说，“你进去，夫人，我把绳结松开，他自己能挣脱。”","‘Now,’ said the sergeant, in a subdued voice, ‘I’ll loosen the knot, and he can work himself free, if you go in, Missis.’"
"她最后看了一眼这个坐在地上的、衣衫不整的、被缚着的男人。然后，她就进屋了，中士迅速地跟着。接着就传来了他们关门、上门闩的声音。","She gave a last look at the dishevelled, bound man, as he sat on the ground.Then she went indoors, followed quickly by the sergeant.Then they were heard locking and barring the door."
"在外面，男人坐在地上，使劲地挣脱绳子。可是，即便这样，想把自己松开并不容易。所以，绑着手的男人努力站了起来，走到旧墙脚，抵着粗糙的墙边磨起绳子。这绳子是草拧成的，不一会儿就磨散了，他自由了。他身上好几处瘀伤。他的胳臂伤到了，由于捆绑而变得淤青。他慢慢地揉着伤处。接着，他把衣服拉直，弯下腰，戴上帽子，挣扎着穿上外套，走开了。","The man seated on the ground outside worked and strained at the rope.But it was not so easy to undo himself even now.So, with hands bound, making an effort, he got on his feet, and went and worked the cord against the rough edge of an old wall.The rope, being of a kind of plaited grass, soon frayed and broke, and he freed himself.He had various contusions.His arms were hurt and bruised from the bonds.He rubbed them slowly.Then he pulled his clothes straight, stooped, put on his cap, struggled into his overcoat, and walked away."
"星光格外明亮。悬崖下的灯塔射出水晶般清澈的光束，有节奏地划过黑夜。男人沿着这条路，茫然地往前走，经过教堂的院落。接着，他停下来，靠在墙上，站了好一阵。","The stars were very brilliant.Clear as crystal, the beam from the lighthouse under the cliffs struck rhythmically on the night.Dazed, the man walked along the road past the churchyard.Then he stood leaning up against a wall, for a long time."
"他清醒过来了，因为脚太冷了。因此，他振作起来，在静谧的黑夜中，又朝小酒馆方向走去。","He was roused because his feet were so cold.So he pulled himself together, and turned again in the silent night, back towards the inn."
"酒馆一片漆黑。但厨房里还亮着灯。他迟疑了一下。接着，他轻轻地试着推了一下门。","The bar was in darkness.But there was a light in the kitchen.He hesitated.Then very quietly he tried the door."
"他很吃惊，发现门是开着的。他走进去，轻轻地把身后的门带上。接着，他绕过吧台，顺着楼梯往下，走到了亮灯的厨房门口。他老婆坐在那儿，呆呆地在火炉前面，荆豆秸秆在灶膛里烧得很旺。她坐在正对着炉灶前的椅子上，岔开两腿，脚抵在围栏上。他进来时，她抬头看了他一眼，但什么也没有说。接着，她又盯着火。","He was surprised to find it open.He entered, and quietly closed it behind him.Then he went down the step past the bar-counter, and through to the lighted doorway of the kitchen.There sat his wife, planted in front of the range, where a furze fire was burning.She sat in a chair full in front of the range, her knees wide apart on the fender.She looked over her shoulder at him as he entered, but she did not speak.Then she stared in the fire again."
"这是一间狭小的厨房。他把帽子放在桌上，上面铺着黄色的美国式的桌布，他背对着墙在火炉边坐下。他的妻子仍然岔开膝盖，两脚放在钢质的围栏上坐着，盯着火，一动不动。火光下，她的皮肤光滑而红润。屋里的每件东西都干净而明亮。男人也默默地坐着，低着头。他们就这样一直坐着。","It was a small, narrow kitchen.He dropped his cap on the table that was covered with yellowish American cloth, and took a seat with his back to the wall, near the oven.His wife still sat with her knees apart, her feet on the steel fender and stared into the fire, motionless.Her skin was smooth and rosy in the firelight.Everything in the house was very clean and bright.The man sat silent, too, his head dropped.And thus they remained."
"谁先开口就成了一个问题。女人俯身向前，在火炉的围栏之间拨弄着荆豆秸秆的一头。他抬起头看看她。","It was a question who would speak first.The woman leaned forward and poked the ends of the sticks in between the bars of the range.He lifted his head and looked at her."
"“其他人都去睡觉了，对吧？”他问。","‘Others gone to bed, have they?’ he asked."
"可她还是保持沉默。","But she remained closed in silence."
"“晚上外面真冷啊。”他好像自言自语地说。","‘’S a cold night, out,’ he said, as if to himself."
"然后，他把宽大但却好看的工人的手掌放在火炉上方，那炉子打磨成黑色，像天鹅绒一样光滑。她虽然没有朝他看，但却从眼角瞥见了他。","And he laid his large, yet well-shapen workman’s hand on the top of the stove, that was polished black and smooth as velvet.She would not look at him, yet she glanced out of the corners of her eyes."
"他两眼闪亮，直勾勾地盯着她，瞳孔放大，像猫的眼睛一样，摄人心魄。","His eyes were fixed brightly on her, the pupils large and electric like those of a cat."
"“我能在茫茫人海中认出你来。”他说，“尽管你比我想的要胖点儿。你可是丰满了许多。”","‘I should have picked you out among thousands,’ he said.‘Though you’re bigger than I’d have believed.Fine flesh you’ve made.’"
"她沉默了一阵。然后，她坐着，身体转向他。","She was silent for some time.Then she turned in her chair upon him."
"“你以为你是谁？”她说，“十五年后，像这样回来找我？你想过没有，我从没听到过你的消息，无论是在比尤特城，还是其他地方？”","‘What do you think of yourself,’ she said, ‘coming back on me like this after over fifteen years?You don’t think I’ve not heard of you, neither, in Butte City and elsewhere?’"
"他看着她，眼睛清澈、半透明，毫不躲闪。","He was watching her with his clear, translucent, unchallenged eyes."
"“不是的。”他说，“伙计们来来往往——我不时地听到你的消息。”","‘Yes,’ he said.‘Chaps comes an’ goes—I’ve heard tell of you from time to time.’"
"她挺直腰板。","She drew herself up."
"“那你都听到了关于我的什么谎话？”她迫切地追问。","‘And what lies have you heard about me?’ she demanded superbly."
"“我没有听到任何谎言——除了说你过得很好之类的话。”","‘I dunno as I’ve heard any lies at all—’cept as you was getting on very well, like.’"
"他的语气显得谨慎而冷漠。她的火气又一次猛地上来了。但她压着火，因为他身上的危险性，也许，更是因为他好看的头型和像画出来的整齐的眉毛，她不忍舍弃它们。","His voice ran warily and detached.Her anger stirred again in her violently.But she subdued it, because of the danger there was in him, and more, perhaps, because of the beauty of his head and his level drawn brows, which she could not bear to forfeit."
"“关于你，我说也说不完。”她说，“我听到的关于你的事都是凶多吉少。”","‘That’s more than I can say of you,’ she said.‘I’ve heard more harm than good about you.’"
"“啊，是吗！”他盯着炉火回答。他看着荆豆秸秆燃烧已经好一会儿了，才自言自语说道。两人又是一阵沉默，在这阵沉默中，她看着他的脸。","‘Ay, I dessay,’ he said, looking in the fire.It was a long time since he had seen the furze burning, he said to himself.There was a silence, during which she watched his face."
"“你还敢说自己是个男人吗？”她说，与其说是生气，不如说是轻蔑地指责。“你什么都不顾地离我而去——现在你又这样出现，一句为自己解释的话都没有。”","‘Do you call yourself a man?’ she said, more in contemptuous reproach than in anger.‘Leave a woman as you’ve left me, you don’t care to what!—and then to turn up in this fashion, without a word to say for yourself.’"
"他在椅子上动来动去，两腿分开，胳臂放在膝盖上，目不转睛地盯着火苗，一句话也没有回答。他的头和他浓密的黑头发离她是如此地近，她几乎忍不住想要移开，仿佛它们会咬她一样。","He stirred in his chair, planted his feet apart, and resting his arms on his knees, looked steadily into the fire, without answering.So near to her was his head, and the close black hair, she could scarcely refrain from starting away, as if it would bite her."
"“这能称得上是男人的行为吗？”她又一次追问。","‘Do you call that the action of a man?’ she repeated."
"“不能。”他说着，伸手去拿这些小的荆豆秸秆，把它们拨弄到火里。“据我所知，这什么也称不上。在我看来，无论怎么样，以任何的名义来称呼这种行为都会认为这是不正当的。”","‘No,’ he said, reaching and poking the bits of wood into the fire with his fingers.‘I didn’t call it anything, as I know of.It’s no good calling things by any names whatsoever, as I know of.’"
"她观察着他的举止。话语间的停顿一次比一次长，尽管两人都没有意识到这一点。","She watched him in his actions.There was a longer and longer pause between each speech, though neither knew it."
"“我很想知道，你是怎么看待你自己的！”她恼怒地强调，高声地喊着，“我想知道你把自己当成什么人！”她茫然失措，非常生气。","‘I wonder what you think of yourself!’ she exclaimed, with vexed emphasis.‘I wonder what sort of a fellow you take yourself to be!’She was really perplexed as well as angry."
"“哎，”他说，抬起头看着她，“我想，要是人人都得为自己的行为负责，那么我也要为我的错误负责。”","‘Well,’ he said, lifting his head to look at her, ‘I guess I’ll answer for my own faults, if everybody else’ll answer for theirs.’"
"当他仰起脸看着她的时候，她的心怦怦地激烈地跳动着。她呼吸急促，别过脸去，几乎失去了自控力。","Her heart beat fiery hot as he lifted his face to her.She breathed heavily, averting her face, almost losing her self-control."
"“那你把我当什么？”她无助地大声喊道。","‘And what do you take me to be?’ she cried, in real helplessness."
"他仰起脸看着她温柔的扭到一边的脸，看着她轻轻起伏的丰满的胸部。","His face was lifted watching her, watching her soft, averted face, and the softly heaving mass of her breasts."
"“我把你当作，”他像对她行使权力似的简洁而坦率地说道，“这么好的可人儿——我竟看不出你是这样一个漂亮的女人。我竟然没有料到你有这么一副好身段：真的，我真没有想到。”","‘I take you,’ he said, with that laconic truthfulness which exercised such power over her, ‘to be the deuce of a fine woman—darn me if you’re not as fine a built woman as I’ve seen, handsome with it as well.I shouldn’t have expected you to put on such handsome flesh: ’struth I shouldn’t.’"
"当他那双宝石般明亮的眼睛紧紧地盯着她的时候，她的心怦怦猛跳。","Her heart beat fiery hot, as he watched her with those bright agate eyes, fixedly."
"“而你十五年都那么英俊，我的老天啊！”她回答道。","‘Been very handsome to you, for fifteen years, my sakes!’ she replied."
"他对此没有回答，只是坐在那里，用明亮而充满活力的眼睛看着她。","He made no answer to this, but sat with his bright, quick eyes upon her."
"接着他站起来。她不由自主地吃了一惊。可他却只是简短地、谨慎地说：","Then he rose.She started involuntarily.But he only said, in his laconic, measured way:"
"“现在这儿真是暖和啊。”","‘It’s warm in here now.’"
"然后他脱掉外衣，把它扔在桌子上。他这样做的时候，她坐在那儿，好像有点吓着了。","And he pulled off his overcoat, throwing it on the table.She sat as if slightly cowed, whilst he did so."
"“这绳子把我的胳臂弄得——哦，天啊——”他拉长语调，用手揉着胳臂。","‘Them ropes has given my arms something, by Ga-ard,’ he drawled, feeling his arms with his hands."
"她仍然坐在他面前的椅子上，有点胆怯。","Still she sat in her chair before him, slightly cowed."
"“你真是厉害，是吧，像那样抓住我，呃？”他温柔地笑起来，“老天，你把我修理得恰到好处，恰到好处。我真该死，你修理得好——很好，你做得很好。”","‘You was sharp, wasn’t you, to catch me like that, eh?’ he smiled slowly.‘By Ga-ard, you had me fixed proper, proper you had.Darn me, you fixed me up proper—proper, you did.’"
"他坐在椅子上，身体俯向她。","He leaned forwards in his chair towards her."
"“我觉得这样对你没有什么不好，没什么不好，要是我那样想，我就真的该死了。我欣赏女人身上的这种胆识。是的，我欣赏。”","‘I don’t think no worse of you for it, no, darned if I do.Fine pluck in a woman’s what I admire.That I do, indeed.’"
"她只是凝视着炉火。","She only gazed into the fire."
"“我们一开始很快乐，是吧。而且，我敢保证，从你看见我的那一刻开始，你和我有一样的感觉。该死，你对我太厉害了。这个该死的好婆娘，干了一场漂亮的架。妈的，在美国任何地方，都找不到一个女人能像那样把我放倒的，只有你了。说真的，你真是一个好女人，尤其是这个时候。”","‘We fet from the start, we did.And, my word, you begin again quick the minute you see me, you did.Darn me, you was too sharp for me.A darn fine woman, puts up a darn good fight.Darn me if I could find a woman in all the darn States as could get me down like that.Wonderful fine woman you be, truth to say, at this minute.’"
"她仍然坐在那儿怒视着炉火。","She only sat glowering into the fire."
"“任何有胆识的男人，都希望找到一个好女人，像我一样。”他说着，伸出手，试探性地、悄悄地触摸她丰满而温暖的胸部。","‘As grand a pluck as a man could wish to find in a woman, true as I’m here,’ he said, reaching forward his hand and tentatively touching her between her full, warm breasts, quietly."
"她吃了一惊，似乎颤抖了一下。可在她继续盯着火的时候，他的手慢慢地伸到了她的乳房之间。","She started, and seemed to shudder.But his hand insinuated itself between her breasts, as she continued to gaze in the fire."
"“难不成你以为我回到这儿是为了讨生活。”他说，“在我名下有一千多英镑，我有钱。对了，打这场架真让我高兴，真的。但是这样并不意味着你就能否认你是我老婆啊……”","‘And don’t you think I’ve come back here a-begging,’ he said.‘I’ve more than one thousand pounds to my name, I have.And a bit of a fight for a how-de-do pleases me, that it do.But that doesn’t mean as you’re going to deny as you’re my Missis....’"
