"沃尔弗特·韦伯或黄金梦","Wolfert Webber, or Golden Dreams"
"作者：华盛顿·欧文","by Washington Irving"
"公元一七——空白——因为我不记得具体的年份了；然而，就是在上个世纪初叶，在曼哈托斯古城住着一位可敬的市民，他的名字叫沃尔弗特·韦伯。他是荷兰布瑞乐城的老考巴斯·韦伯的后代。老考巴斯·韦伯是最初的移民之一，因为引进卷心菜的种植而闻名，他搬到这个地区的时候，绰号“梦想家”的奥洛夫·范考尔特兰特还是当地总督。考巴斯·韦伯最初安家、种卷心菜的那块地一直保留在家族中，家人一直种植着这种菜。我们荷兰市民也因这种值得赞许的坚持不懈的精神而闻名。整个家族几代人的才能都投入到这种高贵的蔬菜的研究与培养中。毫无疑问，韦伯家的卷心菜能有很好的名声和很大的个头，很大程度上要归功于这种才智的集中。","In the year of grace one thousand seven hundred and—blank—for I do not remember the precise date; however, it was somewhere in the early part of the last century, there lived in the ancient city of the Manhattoes a worthy burgher, Wolfert Webber by name.He was descended from old Cobus Webber of the Brille in Holland, one of the original settlers, famous for introducing the cultivation of cabbages, and who came over to the province during the protectorship of Oloffe Van Kortlandt, otherwise called the Dreamer.The field in which Cobus Webber first planted himself and his cabbages had remained ever since in the family, who continued in the same line of husbandry, with that praiseworthy perseverance for which our Dutch burghers are noted.The whole family genius, during several generations was devoted to the study and development of this one noble vegetable; and to this concentration of intellect may doubtless be ascribed the prodigious size and renown to which the Webber cabbages attained."
"韦伯王朝世代相传，从未间断；而且每一支系都能提出确切无疑的证据，来证明其合法性。大儿子不仅继承了他的长相，而且继承了他的土地；如果给这一支系安静的统治者们画肖像的话，就会看到一排形状大小和他们种植的蔬菜出奇地相似的脑袋。","The Webber dynasty continued in uninterrupted succession; and never did a line give more unquestionable proofs of legitimacy.The eldest son succeeded to the looks, as well as the territory of his sire; and had the portraits of this line of tranquil potentates been taken, they would have presented a row of heads marvellously resembling,  in shape and magnitude, the vegetables over which they reigned."
"政府所在地一直是那幢祖传的宅子：一幢荷兰式的房子，房子的正面，或者说是黄砖砌的山墙，越往上越尖；按照习俗，房子顶部是一个铁的风向标。房子的一切都散发着长久居住的人家的那种舒适安全的气息。钉在墙上的小笼子里住着成群的紫崖燕，还有些燕子在屋檐下筑巢；人们都知道，这些喜爱房子的鸟在哪幢房子安家，就会给哪幢房子带来好运。在一个阳关明媚的初夏的早晨，听到鸟儿欢快的叫声是愉悦的。它们在纯净、甜美的空气中飞舞嬉戏，叽叽喳喳地叫着，仿佛是在说韦伯家族的卓越和兴旺。","The seat of government continued unchanged in the family mansion:—a Dutch-built house, with a front, or rather gable-end of yellow brick, tapering to a point, with the customary iron weathercock at the top.Every thing about the building bore the air of long-settled ease and security.Flights of martins peopled the little coops nailed against the walls, and swallows built their nests under the eaves; and every one knows that these house-loving birds bring good luck to the dwelling where they take up their abode.In a bright sunny morning in early summer, it was delectable to hear their cheerful notes, as they sported about in the pure, sweet air, chirping forth, as it were, the greatness and prosperity of the Webbers."
"因此，这个优秀的家族在一株巨大的梧桐树的荫庇下安静舒适地成长着，而这棵树逐渐地长大，竟完全遮住了他们的住宅。城市的郊区也渐渐扩展到了他们的领地周围。房屋拔地而起，挡住了他们的视野。周围的乡村小路开始成为熙熙攘攘、人来人往的街道；总之，尽管还保持着乡村生活习惯，他们开始发觉自己成了城市居民。","Thus quietly and comfortably did this excellent family vegetate under the shade of a mighty button-wood tree, which by little and little grew so great as entirely to overshadow their palace.The city gradually spread its suburbs round their domain.Houses sprung up to interrupt their prospects.The rural lanes in the vicinity began to grow into the bustle and populousness of streets; in short, with all the habits of rustic life they began to find themselves the inhabitants of a city."
"然而，他们一直保留着祖传的品质和祖传的财产，就像德意志帝国下的小王公一样顽固。沃尔弗特是这个家族中最近的一代后人，继承了门前家族大树下、族长专用的长椅，执掌着祖先的权杖，俨然大都市中的一位乡村统治者。","Still, however, they maintained their hereditary character, and hereditary possessions, with all the tenacity of petty German princes in the midst of the Empire.Wolfert was the last of the line, and succeeded to the patriarchal bench at the door, under the family tree, and swayed the sceptre of his fathers, a kind of rural potentate in the midst of a metropolis."
"然而统治过程中也要有人同甘共苦，于是他给自己找了个贤内助。她是非常活跃的优秀女人，也就是说，她是一个非常典型的没事瞎忙的小主妇。但是，她的活动只限于一个特殊的方面；她的整个人生似乎都在致力于紧张的编织；不管是在家还是在外面，走着还是坐着，她的针总是移动着。甚至有人证实，由于她不知疲惫的辛勤劳动，她几乎可以供应给全家人一年到头要穿的袜子。这对可敬的夫妇生了一个女儿，这个女孩在他们极为温柔的呵护下成长；他们为女儿的教育付出了极大的努力，因此，她会各种编织方法，会做各种泡菜和蜜饯，还会把自己的名字绣在刺绣样品上。她的品味也体现在她家美观又实用的花园上：一排排火红的金盏花和灿烂的蜀葵围绕在卷心菜地的边上；巨大的向日葵把它们宽大愉快的脸靠在篱笆上，仿佛在深情地向路人抛着媚眼。","To share the cares and sweets of sovereignty, he had taken unto himself a help-mate, one of that excellent kind called stirring women; that is to say, she was one of those notable little housewives who are always busy when there is nothing to do.Her activity however, took one particular direction; her whole life seemed devoted to intense knitting; whether at home or abroad; walking or sitting, her needles were continually in motion, and it is even affirmed that by her unwearied industry she very nearly supplied her household with stockings throughout the year.This worthy couple were blessed with one daughter, who was brought up with great tenderness and care; uncommon pains had been taken with her education, so that she could stitch in every variety of way; make all kinds of pickles and preserves, and mark her own name on a sampler.The influence of her taste was seen also in the family garden, where the ornamental began to mingle with the useful; whole rows of fiery marigolds and splendid hollyhocks bordered the cabbage-beds; and gigantic sunflowers lolled their broad, jolly faces over the fences, seeming to ogle most affectionately the passers-by."
"沃尔弗特就这样平和又满足地统治、耕种着这片祖传的土地。不仅如此，像其他统治者一样，他偶尔也有忧虑和苦恼。有时他故乡的发展让他恼火。街道和房子渐渐包围了他那块小小的领地，挡住了阳光和空气。他还时不时地受到边界上人群的打扰，他们大批出没于都市的街道上。这些人有时候会在午夜偷袭他的领地，夺走成排的高贵的卷心菜。有时，在大门开着的时候，流浪猪也会闯入，把所有的东西弄得一团糟；由于向日葵把头温柔地伸出墙外，那些爱恶作剧的顽童们经常砍下灿烂的向日葵的头，它可是这一花园的荣耀。然而这一切只是琐碎的牢骚，可能会时不时地在他的脑海里引起一丝不快，就像夏日的微风在磨坊水池的水面上吹起了涟漪；但是这些不会扰乱他内心深处的平静。他只要抓起放在门后的那根可靠的棍子，突然冲出去，冲着入侵者的背上打去，不管是猪还是顽皮的孩子，然后回到屋里，就无比地神清气爽、心平气和了。然而，让诚实的沃尔弗特焦虑的主要原因是城市的日益繁荣。生活的开支已经是原来的两三倍，但是他不能把卷心菜的大小也增加到两三倍；竞争者越来越多，抑制了菜价的上涨。因此，当周围的每个人都变得越来越富时，他自己却越来越穷。而且，他无论如何也不知道如何才能摆脱这一切不幸。","Thus reigned and vegetated Wolfert Webber over his paternal acres, peaceably and contentedly.Not but that, like all other sovereigns, he had his occasional cares and vexations.The growth of his native city sometimes caused him annoyance.His little territory gradually became hemmed in by streets and houses, which intercepted air and sunshine.He was now and then subject to the irruptions of the border population, that infest the streets of a metropolis, who would sometimes make midnight forays into his dominions, and carry off captive whole platoons of his noblest subjects.Vagrant swine would make a descent, too, now and then, when the gate was left open, and lay all waste before them; and mischievous urchins would often decapitate the illustrious sunflowers, the glory of the garden, as they lolled their heads so fondly over the walls.Still all these were petty grievances, which might now and then ruffle the surface of his mind, as a summer breeze will ruffle the surface of a mill-pond; but they could not disturb the deep-seated quiet of his soul.He would seize a trusty staff, that stood behind the door, issue suddenly out, and anoint the back of the aggressor, whether pig or urchin, and then return within doors, marvellously refreshed and tranquillized.The chief cause of anxiety to honest Wolfert, however, was the growing prosperity of the city.The expenses of living doubled and trebled; but he could not double and treble the magnitude of his cabbages; and the number of competitors prevented the increase of price; thus, therefore, while every one around him grew richer, Wolfert grew poorer, and he could not, for the life of him, perceive how the evil was to be remedied."
"这种担心与日俱增，渐渐地影响着我们这位可敬的公民。就这样，他的前额终于长出了两三道皱纹，这是在韦伯家族中从未听说过的事；它似乎让他那顶三角帽的棱角也翘了起来，显出焦虑的样子，这与他那些杰出祖先的宽帽檐、低帽顶、显得宁静的海狸帽子截然相反。","This growing care which increased from day to day, had its gradual effect upon our worthy burgher; insomuch, that it at length implanted two or three wrinkles on his brow; things unknown before in the family of the Webbers; and it seemed to pinch up the corners of his cocked hat into an expression of anxiety, totally opposite to the tranquil, broad-brimmed, low-crowned beavers of his illustrious progenitors."
"或者即使这些都没有实质性地打扰到他宁静的心情，他只要照顾自己和妻子就好，他的女儿也要渐渐长大成人，全世界的人都知道，女儿开始走向成熟时，比任何一种水果或鲜花都更需要精心呵护。我没有描写女性魅力的才能，不然我很乐意描述一下这个荷兰小美女的成长过程。她的蓝眼睛越来越蓝，她的樱桃小嘴越来越红。在过去十六年的芬芳空气中，她一天天地成熟，一天天地丰满，到了十七岁的春天，她仿佛要冲破她的紧身衣，就如同一朵半开的玫瑰花蕾。","Perhaps even this would not have materially disturbed the serenity of his mind had he had only himself and his wife to care for; but there was his daughter gradually growing to maturity; and all the world knows when daughters begin to ripen no fruit or flower requires so much looking after.I have no talent at describing female charms, else fain would I depict the progress of this little Dutch beauty.How her blue eyes grew deeper and deeper, and her cherry lips redder and redder; and how she ripened and ripened, and rounded and rounded in the opening breath of sixteen summers, until, in her seventeenth spring, she seemed ready to burst out of her bodice like a half-blown rose-bud."
"啊，哎呀！我怎么描绘当时的她呢，那是一个星期日的早晨，她用母亲给她的钥匙，打开了老式荷兰衣橱，穿上了衣橱里祖传的华丽服饰。那是她祖母的结婚礼服，已经改成了当下能穿的样子，有各式各样的装饰，是家族中代代相传的传家宝。她在自己浅褐色的头发上涂上了酪乳，把头发弄出平滑、弯曲的线条，分到漂亮的前额的两边。她脖子上戴着赤金项链，那个小十字架刚好放在温软的幸福谷的入口，好像它会使这儿显得更加圣洁。还有——但是，呸！——不应该是像我这样的老男人来描述女性的美貌：只要说这么一句就已足够，埃米已经满十七岁了。很早以前，她的刺绣样品上就出现了被一支箭紧紧穿在一起的两颗心，还有深蓝色丝绸所制成的同心结，这说明她开始渴望着比种向日葵和腌黄瓜更有趣的事情了。","Ah, well-a-day! could I but show her as she was then, tricked out on a Sunday morning in the hereditary finery of the old Dutch clothes-press, of which her mother had confided to her the key.The wedding dress of her grandmother, modernized for use, with sundry ornaments, handed down as heirlooms in the family.Her pale brown hair smoothed with buttermilk in flat waving lines on each side of her fair forehead.The chain of yellow virgin gold, that encircled her neck; the little cross, that just rested at the entrance of a soft valley of happiness, as if it would sanctify the place.The—but pooh!—it is not for an old man like me to be prosing about female beauty: suffice it to say, Amy had attained her seventeenth year.Long since had her sampler exhibited hearts in couples desperately transfixed with arrows, and true lovers’ knots worked in deep blue silk; and it was evident she began to languish for some more interesting occupation than the rearing of sunflowers or pickling of cucumbers."
"这是女人一生中的关键时期，少女的心就像胸前的心形饰物，容易被一个单一的形象占据，沃尔弗特·韦伯家开始出现一个新客人。他是德克·沃尔德伦，一个可怜寡妇的独子，不过他倒是能吹嘘他比这个州的任何少年都多几个父亲，因为她的母亲嫁过四个男人，而只有这一个儿子。因此，尽管他是母亲在最后一段婚姻里生的儿子，他却可以自命为经历过长期培植、晚结的果实。这个拥有四个父亲的儿子凝聚了他们所有的优点和活力。如果说他之前不属于一个强大的家族，那么，他却很有可能以后有一个。因为你只要看看这个朝气蓬勃、逍遥快乐的少年，也就能明白他生来就是要做一个强大家族的创始人的。","At this critical period of female existence, when the heart within a damsel’s bosom, like its emblem, the miniature which hangs without, is apt to be engrossed by a single image, a new visitor began to make his appearance under the roof of Wolfert Webber.This was Dirk Waldron, the only son of a poor widow, but who could boast of more fathers than any lad in the province; for his mother had had four husbands, and this only child, so that though born in her last wedlock, he might fairly claim to be the tardy fruit of a long course of cultivation.This son of four fathers united the merits and the vigor of his sires.If he had not a great family before him, he seemed likely to have a great one after him; for you had only to look at the fresh gamesome youth, to see that he was formed to be the founder of a mighty race."
"这个年轻人逐渐成了这家的熟客。他讲话不多，但是呆的时间很长。那位父亲的烟斗空了，他就会为他装满；那位母亲的织衣针或毛线球掉到地上了，他就会为她捡起；他会抚摸玳瑁猫光滑的皮毛；他会拿起火炉上唱歌的、光亮的铜壶给那位女儿加水。这些极小的琐事看似不值一提，但是当真爱被翻译为荷兰方言，那它就用这种方式生动地表达了自己。这些举动韦伯家的人都明白。这个可爱的年轻人已经从那位母亲的眼中看到非常大的好感；那只玳瑁猫，即使是同类中最稳重端庄的猫，也对他的造访表现出不庸质疑的赞赏；那只铜壶仿佛唱着欢快的音符欢迎他的到来；还有，从那位女儿心照不宣的眼神可以准确地看出，她微笑着矜持地坐在她母亲旁边做针线活的时候，她对年轻人的好感也不亚于韦伯太太、那只猫或者那只铜壶。","This youngster gradually became an intimate visitor of the family.He talked little, but he sat long.He filled the father’s pipe when it was empty, gathered up the mother’s knitting-needle, or ball of worsted when it fell to the ground; stroked the sleek coat of the tortoise-shell cat, and replenished the teapot for the daughter from the bright copper kettle that sung before the fire.All these quiet little offices may seem of trifling import, but when true love is translated into Low Dutch, it is in this way that it eloquently expresses itself.They were not lost upon the Webber family.The winning youngster found marvellous favor in the eyes of the mother; the tortoise-shell cat, albeit the most staid and demure of her kind, gave indubitable signs of approbation of his visits, the tea-kettle seemed to sing out a cheering note of welcome at his approach, and if the sly glances of the daughter might be rightly read, as she sat bridling and dimpling, and sewing by her mother’s side, she was not a wit behind Dame Webber, or grimalkin, or the tea-kettle in good-will."
"只有沃尔弗特一个人没看出发生的事情。他只顾沉思着城市和卷心菜的成长，总是坐在那儿盯着火炉，沉默地吸着烟斗。然而，一天夜晚，文雅的埃米习惯性地打着灯送她的情人去门外，而她的情人也习惯性地送上离别的吻时，这一响吻的回声如此有力，它穿过了长长的、安静的过道，甚至惊动了沃尔弗特迟钝的耳朵。他慢慢地转入了新一层的焦虑。他从来没想到，这个孩子，好像几天前还绕着他的膝盖乱爬，玩着布娃娃和娃娃房子，会一下就想到了爱情和婚姻。他揉了揉眼睛，细想了实情，果然发现，当他在梦想其他事情的时候，她真的长成了一个女人，而且坠入了爱河。可怜的沃尔弗特又有了新的担心。他是一个和蔼的父亲，但也是一个谨慎的人。这个年轻人是一个非常活泼的少年，但是他没有钱，也没有土地。沃尔弗特的思想全集中到一个问题上了。如果结婚了，他就别无选择，只能把卷心菜园子的一角给这对年轻人，而整个园子才刚刚够维持一家人的生活。","Wolfert alone saw nothing of what was going on.Profoundly wrapt up in meditation on the growth of the city and his cabbages, he sat looking in the fire, and puffing his pipe in silence.One night, however, as the gentle Amy, according to custom, lighted her lover to the outer door, and he, according to custom, took his parting salute, the smack resounded so vigorously through the long, silent entry as to startle even the dull ear of Wolfert.He was slowly roused to a new source of anxiety.It had never entered into his head, that this mere child, who, as it seemed but the other day, had been climbing about his knees, and playing with dolls and baby-houses, could all at once be thinking of love and matrimony.He rubbed his eyes, examined into the fact, and really found that while he had been dreaming of other matters, she had actually grown into a woman, and what was more, had fallen in love.Here were new cares for poor Wolfert.He was a kind father, but he was a prudent man.The young man was a very stirring lad; but then he had neither money or land.Wolfert’s ideas all ran in one channel, and he saw no alternative in case of a marriage, but to portion off the young couple with a corner of his cabbage garden, the whole of which was barely sufficient for the support of his family."
"所以，作为一个谨慎的父亲，他决定把这份激情扼杀在萌芽中。他禁止这个年轻人来家里，尽管这件事违反了他作为父亲的心意，令他很难过，而且也使得女儿明亮的眼睛默默落下了许多泪。然而，她表现出的是一个孝顺、顺从的女儿的典范。她从没有撅嘴、生气；她从没有冒犯父母的权威；她从没有情绪激动，或是像很多浪漫的、爱读小说的年轻女士一样歇斯底里。她没有，的确没有！我保证，她不是那种冒险、叛逆、浅薄的人。相反，她就像一个孝顺的女儿，当着情人的面，把街门关上。如果有时答应他见面，也是在厨房的窗外或园子的篱笆外。","Like a prudent father, therefore, he determined to nip this passion in the bud, and forbade the youngster the house, though sorely did it go against his fatherly heart, and many a silent tear did it cause in the bright eye of his daughter.She showed herself, however, a pattern of filial piety and obedience.She never pouted and sulked; she never flew in the face of parental authority; she never fell into a passion, or fell into hysterics, as many romantic novel-read young ladies would do.Not she, indeed!She was none such heroical rebellious trumpery, I warrant ye.On the contrary, she acquiesced like an obedient daughter; shut the street-door in her lover’s face, and if ever she did grant him an interview, it was either out of the kitchen window, or over the garden fence."
"一个星期六的下午沃尔弗特去了一家离城里大概有两英里的乡间旅馆，路上他一直在脑中深刻、仔细地考虑着这些事，由于异常地忧虑，他皱着眉头。这是当地的荷兰人最爱去的一个地方，因为它一直由荷兰店主经营，并且保持着过去美好时光的风味和情调。这是一幢荷兰式的房子，可能是殖民初期某个富人家的乡间别墅。它坐落在一个叫做“考尔里尔钩”的岬角附近，一直延伸至桑德湾。潮涨潮落的时候，潮水都以极快的速度冲击着它。这幢庄严又有点古怪的房子远远地就能看见，有一片榆树和美国梧桐树混杂的林子——仿佛在发出盛情邀请，还有几棵垂柳，那潮湿下垂的叶子好像瀑布一般，让人们觉得凉快，也成了在炎热的夏天吸引客人的地方。","Wolfert was deeply cogitating these things in his mind, and his brow wrinkled with unusual care, as he wended his way one Saturday afternoon to a rural inn, about two miles from the city.It was a favorite resort of the Dutch part of the community, from being always held by a Dutch line of landlords, and retaining an air and relish of the good old times.It was a Dutch-built house, that had probably been a country seat of some opulent burgher in the early time of the settlement.It stood near a point of land, called Corlears Hook, which stretches out into the Sound, and against which the tide, at its flux and reflux, sets with extraordinary rapidity.The venerable and somewhat crazy mansion was distinguished from afar, by a grove of elms and sycamores that seemed to wave a hospitable invitation, while a few weeping willows with their dank, drooping foliage, resembling falling waters, gave an idea of coolness, that rendered it an attractive spot during the heats of summer."
"因此，正如我所说，这儿是很多曼哈托斯的老住户常来的地方。在这儿，有人玩打圆盘、掷圈环或九柱戏，其他人就悠闲地抽着烟斗，谈论着公共事务。","Here, therefore, as I said, resorted many of the old inhabitants of the Manhattoes, where, while some played at the shuffle-board and quoits and ninepins, others smoked a deliberate pipe, and talked over public affairs."
"那是一个刮风的秋天的下午，沃尔弗特去了这家旅馆。那片榆树林、柳树林的叶子都被吹落，在地上盘旋打转，发出沙沙的声响。","It was on a blustering autumnal afternoon that Wolfert made his visit to the inn.The grove of elms and willows was stripped of its leaves, which whirled in rustling eddies about the fields."
"玩九柱戏的地方空无一人，这是因为冷天的提早到来把人们赶到屋子里去了。由于是星期六下午，俱乐部按照惯例在开会，这里的成员大都是常来的荷兰市民，虽然偶尔会有些不同个性、来自不同国家的成员，但在这种人群混杂的地方也不足为奇。","The ninepin alley was deserted, for the premature chilliness of the day had driven the company within doors.As it was Saturday afternoon, the habitual club was in session, composed principally of regular Dutch burghers, though mingled occasionally with persons of various character and country, as is natural in a place of such motley population."
"壁炉旁边，坐在一个巨大的皮革垫扶手椅上的是这个小世界的独裁者，值得尊敬的雷姆，或按照当地口音，拉姆·拉普里。","Beside the fire-place, and in a huge leather-bottomed armchair, sat the dictator of this little world, the venerable Rem, or, as it was pronounced, Ramm Rapelye."
"他是瓦龙人，因为古老的家世而非常有名气，他的曾祖母是这个州出生的第一个白人小孩。但是他的财富和高贵让他更有名气：他老早就获得了市议员这样高贵的官衔，连总督都会摘下帽子对他行礼。长久以来，他始终占有着这个皮革面的扶手椅，并且自从当上市议员后他就渐渐发福了，没几年他就占满了整个座椅。他的命令对属下来说是不容置疑的，因为他太富有了，根本就不需要什么论据来支持他的任何意见。店主服侍他的时候总是特别殷勤，并不是因为他付的钱比其他的邻居多，而是富人手里的钱似乎总是更令人满意。店主总是在令人敬畏的雷姆耳边讲好听的话和笑话讨好他。事实却是，雷姆从来没有笑过。实际上，他总是像獒一样严肃，甚至有些乖戾，但有时也会表示赞许，奖赏我们的店主。虽然他只不过是哼一声，但对店主而言，这却比一个穷人的哈哈大笑还要令他开心。","He was a man of Walloon race, and illustrious for the antiquity of his line, his great grandmother having been the first white child born in the province.But he was still more illustrious for his wealth and dignity: he had long filled the noble office of alderman, and was a man to whom the governor himself took off his hat.He had maintained possession of the leathern-bottomed chair from time immemorial; and had gradually waxed in bulk as he sat in his seat of government, until in the course of years he filled its whole magnitude.His word was decisive with his subjects; for he was so rich a man, that he was never expected to support any opinion by argument.The landlord waited on him with peculiar officiousness; not that he paid better than his neighbors, but then the coin of a rich man seems always to be so much more acceptable.The landlord had always a pleasant word and a joke, to insinuate in the ear of the august Ramm.It is true, Ramm never laughed, and, indeed, maintained a mastiff-like gravity, and even surliness of aspect, yet he now and then rewarded mine host with a token of approbation; which, though nothing more nor less than a kind of grunt, yet delighted the landlord more than a broad laugh from a poorer man."
"“今晚对那些掘金人来说可是一个艰难的夜晚。”店主说。这时一阵风在房子周围呼啸，把窗户吹得咯吱响。","“This will be a rough night for the money-diggers,” said mine host, as a gust of wind howled round the house, and rattled at the windows."
"“什么，他们又行动了？”一个拿半薪的英国船长说，他只有一只眼睛，是旅店里的常客。","“What, are they at their works again?” said an English half-pay captain, with one eye, who was a frequent attendant at the inn."
"“是呀，可不是嘛，”店主说，“很可能去了。他们最近很走运。他们说一大罐钱从地里被挖出来了，就在施托伊弗桑特的果园后面。人们都觉得那一定是很久以前荷兰总督彼得·施托伊弗桑特埋在那儿的。”","“Aye, are they,” said the landlord, “and well may they be.They’ve had luck of late.They say a great pot of money has been dug up in the field, just behind Stuyvesant’s orchard.Folks think it must have been buried there in old times by Peter Stuyvesant, the Dutch Governor.”"
"“胡说！”那个独眼的船长一边说，一边往杯底的白兰地里加了点水。","“Fudge!” said the one-eyed man of war, as he added a small portion of water to a bottom of brandy."
"“好吧，随便你信不信。”店主有点恼火地说，“但是大家都知道，当时荷兰动乱，英国兵占领了这个州，老总督把一大笔钱埋在了地下。他们还说，这位老人家现在还走动呢。嗨，他穿的衣服简直就跟祖屋里挂的画像一模一样。”","“Well, you may believe, or not, as you please,” said mine host, somewhat nettled; “but every body knows that the old governor buried a great deal of his money at the time of the Dutch troubles, when the English red-coats seized on the province.They say, too, the old gentleman walks; aye, and in the very same dress that he wears in the picture which hangs up in the family house.”"
"“胡说！”拿半薪的船长说。","“Fudge!” said the half-pay officer."
"“胡说，你爱怎么说就怎么说吧！但是科尼·范赞特不是在午夜看到他那条木头腿在草地上踱来踱去，手里拿着一把出鞘的、亮得像火一样的利剑吗？那他到底为什么踱步呢，还不是因为有人在他以前埋钱的地方捣乱？”","“Fudge, if you please!—But didn’t Corney Van Zandt see him at midnight, stalking about in the meadow with his wooden leg, and a drawn sword in his hand, that flashed like fire?And what can he be walking for, but because people have been troubling the place where he buried his money in old times?”"
"说到这儿，店主被拉姆·拉普里清喉咙的声音打断了，这说明拉姆·拉普里正在努力以不寻常的方式动着脑筋。他太伟大了，审慎的店主是决不会忽视他的。店主恭敬地闭嘴，等着他发话。这时，这位大人物的肥胖身形表现出了火山即将爆发的各种征兆。最初，只看见肚子起起伏伏，像地震一样；然后他从火山口，也就是那张嘴里，喷出了一股烟草的云雾；之后他的喉咙又发出某种声响，好像要说的话正挣扎着穿过喉咙的粘痰地带；后来他说了点支离破碎的话，并在一阵咳嗽中停了下来；最后他的声音冲了出来，很缓慢，但那语气却绝对是属于那种就算没有感觉到自己语言的重量、也能够感觉到自己财富的重量的人。他每讲完一部分，就不耐烦地喷出一股烟。","Here the landlord was interrupted by several guttural sounds from Ramm Rapelye, betokening that he was laboring with the unusual production of an idea.As he was too great a man to be slighted by a prudent publican, mine host respectfully paused until he should deliver himself.The corpulent frame of this mighty burgher now gave all the symptoms of a volcanic mountain on the point of an eruption.First, there was a certain heaving of the abdomen, not unlike an earthquake; then was emitted a cloud of tobacco smoke from that crater, his mouth; then there was a kind of rattle in the throat, as if the idea were working its way up through a region of phlegm; then there were several disjointed members of a sentence thrown out, ending in a cough; at length his voice forced its way in the slow, but absolute tone of a man who feels the weight of his purse, if not of his ideas; every portion of his speech being marked by a testy puff of tobacco smoke."
"“谁说老彼得·施托伊弗桑特在走动的？——噗——难道人们都不会尊重人吗？——噗——噗——彼得·施托伊弗桑特知道怎么更好地处理他的钱，而不是把钱埋到地下——噗——我知道施托伊弗桑特家族——噗——他们中的每一个人——噗——那是全州最值得尊敬的家族——噗——标准的老派——噗——热情的屋主——噗——不像你们这些暴发户——噗——噗——噗。别跟我说关于彼特·施托伊弗桑特在走动的话——噗——噗——噗——噗。”","“Who talks of old Peter Stuyvesant’s walking?—puff—Have people no respect for persons?—puff—puff—Peter Stuyvesant knew better what to do with his money than to bury it—puff—I know the Stuyvesant family—puff—every one of them—puff—not a more respectable family in the province—puff—old standers—puff—warm householders—puff—none of your upstarts—puff—puff—puff.—Don’t talk to me of Peter Stuyvesant’s walking—puff—puff—puff—puff.”"
"说到这儿，令人敬畏的雷姆皱起了眉头，紧闭着嘴，直到两边嘴角都皱了起来，于是他更加猛烈地抽着烟斗。一团团烟雾很快就围绕着他的头，好像浓烟包围着可怕的埃特纳火山顶一样。","Here the redoubtable Ramm contracted his brow, clasped up his mouth, till it wrinkled at each corner, and redoubled his smoking with such vehemence, that the cloudly volumes soon wreathed round his head, as the smoke envelopes the awful summit of Mount Etna."
"这位极有钱的人突然斥责了大家之后，大家都沉默了。然而，这个话题太有趣了，人们不容易放弃。不一会儿，这个话题又从皮契·普劳·范霍克嘴里跑了出来。他是俱乐部的史官，是那种絮絮叨叨的老头子——年纪越大，说起话来就越没完没了，直到变得几乎完全没有节制。","A general silence followed the sudden rebuke of this very rich man.The subject, however, was too interesting to be readily abandoned.The conversation soon broke forth again from the lips of Peechy Prauw Van Hook, the chronicler of the club, one of those narrative old men who seem to grow incontinent of words, as they grow old, until their talk flows from them almost involuntarily."
"无论什么时候，皮契都能在一个晚上讲出足够多的故事，够听众消化一个月的。现在，他又提起这个话题。他肯定地说，据他所知，在这座岛上的许多地方，前前后后的确掘出了不少钱。那些幸运儿在发现它们之前总是要梦见它们三次，而且值得注意的是，这些钱向来只有古老、优秀的荷兰人家的某个后代才能找到，这就清楚地证明，那些钱是古时候荷兰人埋的。","Peechy, who could at any time tell as many stories in an evening as his hearers could digest in a month, now resumed the conversation, by affirming that, to his knowledge, money had at different times been dug up in various parts of the island.The lucky persons who had discovered them had always dreamt of them three times beforehand, and what was worthy of remark, these treasures had never been found but by some descendant of the good old Dutch families, which clearly proved that they had been buried by Dutchmen in the olden time."
"“你们荷兰人就瞎编吧！”拿半薪的船长说，“荷兰人跟它们一点关系都没有。那些都是海盗基德和他手下的人埋的。”","“Fiddle-stick with your Dutchmen!” cried the half-pay officer.“The Dutch had nothing to do with them.They were all buried by Kidd, the pirate, and his crew.”"
"这句话触到了正题，激起了所有在场的人的兴趣。当时，基德船长的名字就像法宝一样，成千上万的异事奇闻都和他有关。","Here a key-note was touched that roused the whole company.The name of Captain Kidd was like a talisman in those times, and was associated with a thousand marvellous stories."
"这位拿半薪的船长在俱乐部这些温顺的人中间是个极重要的人物，这是由于他的军人个性，以及他亲自述说的、自己所看到的战斗场面。","The half-pay officer was a man of great weight among the peaceable members of the club, by reason of his military character, and of the gunpowder scenes which, by his own account, he had witnessed."
"然而，皮契·普劳的故事丝毫不逊色于关于基德的精彩故事。皮契·普劳没有让一个外国强盗把他的荷兰祖先弄得暗淡无光，而是用彼得·施托伊弗桑特和他同时代人埋藏的财富，把附近的每一个地方变成了财富之源。","The golden stories of Kidd, however, were resolutely rivalled by the tales of Peechy Prauw, who, rather than suffer his Dutch progenitors to be eclipsed by a foreign freebooter, enriched every spot in the neighborhood with the hidden wealth of Peter Stuyvesant and his contemporaries."
"沃尔弗特·韦伯把这些话一字不漏地记下来了。他沉思着回家了，脑子里充满了关于地下财富的宏大想法。他土生土长的这个小岛上的土壤好像全变成了金沙，每一块田地都充满了财宝。一定有很多次，他都不经意地走过那些埋藏了无数宝藏的地方，这些宝藏就在他脚下，草皮几乎都盖不住，一想到这些，他就不由地觉得头晕目眩。他沉浸在这些新想法的漩涡中无法自拔。当他看到祖先留下的古老的房子，以及韦伯家族长久以来心满意足地经营着的小王国，他不禁为自己穷苦的命运感到忿恨。","Not a word of this conversation was lost upon Wolfert Webber.He returned pensively home, full of magnificent ideas of buried riches.The soil of his native island seemed to be turned into gold-dust; and every field teemed with treasure.His head almost reeled at the thought how often he must have heedlessly rambled over places where countless sums lay, scarcely covered by the turf beneath his feet.His mind was in a vertigo with this whirl of new ideas.As he came in sight of the venerable mansion of his forefathers, and the little realm where the Webbers had so long and so contentedly flourished, his gorge rose at the narrowness of his destiny."
"“倒霉的沃尔弗特！”他叹息道，“别人上床睡觉，就能梦到自己身处财富之矿，他们早晨拿着铁锨就能把达布隆（西班牙及其原美洲殖民地的旧金币名）像土豆一样挖出来；但你却一定要梦到艰辛，醒来后依然贫穷——一定要一年到头地翻地，然而，除了卷心菜却什么都没有。","“Unlucky Wolfert!” exclaimed he, “others can go to bed and dream themselves into whole mines of wealth; they have but to seize a spade in the morning, and turn up doubloons like potatoes; but thou must dream of hardship, and rise to poverty—must dig thy field from year’s end to year’s end, and—and yet raise nothing but cabbages!”"
"沃尔弗特怀着沉重的心情躺在床上。那些关于金钱的幻想一直打扰着他的思绪，过了好久他才睡熟。可是，这些幻想继续出现在他沉睡时的思绪中，而且变得更加具体。他梦见自己在菜园的中心发现了一笔巨大的财富。铁锨每铲一次，就露出一个金块；钻石十字架在尘土中闪闪发光；有很多鼓鼓的钱袋，里面装满了八里亚尔币披索（旧时西班牙硬币名）或古老的达布隆；还有一个个箱子，里面塞满了莫艾多（葡萄牙、巴西旧金币）、达克特（旧时的欧洲金币、银币名）、比塞塔里恩（西班牙旧银币名），这些箱子在他欣喜若狂的眼神中打开，吐出了里面闪闪发光的东西。","Wolfert Webber went to bed with a heavy heart; and it was long before the golden visions that disturbed his brain, permitted him to sink into repose.The same visions, however, extended into his sleeping thoughts, and assumed a more definite form.He dreamt that he had discovered an immense treasure in the centre of his garden.At every stroke of the spade he laid bare a golden ingot; diamond crosses sparkled out of the dust; bags of money turned up their bellies, corpulent with pieces of eight, or venerable doubloons; and chests, wedged close with moidores, ducats, and pistareens, yawned before his ravished eyes, and vomited forth their glittering contents."
"沃尔弗特一觉醒来，反而比以前任何时候都贫穷。他没有心思做平时所关注的那些看上去微不足道、毫无价值的事了，而是整天坐在壁炉角那儿，对着炉火幻想着无数的金块和成堆的金子。第二天夜晚，他又做了同样的梦。梦中，他又在他的园子里挖掘着，挖出了一大笔埋在地下的财富。这件事的重复发生非常奇怪。他又胡思乱想了一天。虽然这是大扫除的日子，而且和一般的荷兰人家一样，房子里乱成一团，他却在一片喧闹声中坐着一动不动。","Wolfert awoke a poorer man than ever.He had no heart to go about his daily concerns, which appeared so paltry and profitless; but sat all day long in the chimney-corner, picturing to himself ingots and heaps of gold in the fire.The next night his dream was repeated.He was again in his garden, digging, and laying open stores of hidden wealth.There was something very singular in this repetition.He passed another day of reverie, and though it was cleaning-day, and the house, as usual in Dutch households, completely topsy-turvy, yet he sat unmoved amidst the general uproar."
"第三天晚上，他上床睡觉时，心扑通扑通地快速跳动着。他把红色睡帽翻过来戴，祈求好运的到来。他的心里焦虑万分，直到深夜他才睡着。黄金梦再一次出现了，他又一次看到他的菜园里满是金块和钱袋。","The third night he went to bed with a palpitating heart.He put on his red nightcap, wrong side outwards for good luck.It was deep midnight before his anxious mind could settle itself into sleep.Again the golden dream was repeated, and again he saw his garden teeming with ingots and money-bags."
"第二天早晨，沃尔弗特醒来时，茫然不知所措。从未听说过一个梦连做三次还不能成真的，如此说来，他要发大财了。","Wolfert rose the next morning in complete bewilderment.A dream three times repeated was never known to lie; and if so, his fortune was made."
"焦虑中他把马甲的背面穿到了前面，这进一步证明了他要交好运。他再也不怀疑，他菜园的某个地方一定埋着一大笔钱，正害羞地等着他去寻找。他有些埋怨自己，这么长时间一直在表面翻土，却没有挖到园子中心。","In his agitation he put on his waistcoat with the hind part before, and this was a corroboration of good luck.He no longer doubted that a huge store of money lay buried somewhere in his cabbage-field, coyly waiting to be sought for, and he half repined at having so long been scratching about the surface of the soil, instead of digging to the centre."
"他坐着吃早餐的时候，脑子里充满了这种猜想，以至于他竟要女儿放一块金子在他的茶里，把一盘薄饼递给他的妻子时，还让她随便吃块达布隆。","He took his seat at the breakfast-table full of these speculations; asked his daughter to put a lump of gold in to his tea, and on handing his wife a plate of slap-jacks, begging her to help herself to a doubloon."
"他现在最关心的就是怎样来保护这笔巨大的财富，不让别人知道。他白天也不再按时去地里干活了，现在半夜偷偷从床上爬起来，带上铁锨和镐，在祖先留下的地上从一头刨挖到另一头。没多久，整个园子曾经美好而规律的景象——成排的卷心菜像战时队列中的蔬菜部队一样——被破坏了，一片狼藉；而无情的沃尔弗特头上戴着睡帽，手中拿着灯和铁锨，踏过那些被他糟蹋了的阵列，成了摧毁自己蔬菜世界的恶神。","His grand care now was how to secure this immense treasure without it being known.Instead of working regularly in his grounds in the day-time, he now stole from his bed at night, and with spade and pickaxe, went to work to rip up and dig about his paternal acres, from one end to the other.In a little time the whole garden, which had presented such a goodly and regular appearance, with its phalanx of cabbages, like a vegetable army in battle array, was reduced to a scene of devastation, while the relentless Wolfert, with nightcap on head, and lantern and spade in hand, stalked through the slaughtered ranks, the destroying angel of his own vegetable world."
"每天早晨的情景都证实了前一天晚上卷心菜受到的摧残，从嫩芽到完全成熟的菜头，不同阶段、各种状态的卷心菜都像毫无价值的杂草一样被无情地从安静的菜园中连根拔起，被扔在阳光下任其枯萎。沃尔弗特妻子的规劝是徒劳的；他心爱的女儿为那些被毁掉的、她最爱的万寿菊而哭泣，这也无济于事。“你会拥有另一种意想不到的金花，”他一边喊，一边抚摸着她的下巴，“你还会有一串弯弯的达克特来当作结婚项链，我的孩子。”整个家庭都开始真正为这个可怜的人担心，怕他心智出了问题。夜里睡觉时，他总是咕哝着财富之矿、珍珠、钻石和金条。白天，他郁郁寡欢，心不在焉，连走路都好像是恍恍惚惚的。韦伯夫人经常与邻里一些老妇人们商量，也不忘去教区牧师那里。一天中，几乎每个时辰都能看到一群老妇人在她家门口晃着白帽子，而这个可怜的女人就凄惨地背诵起来。而他的女儿也不得不在与她的情郎——德克·沃尔德伦——的幽会中寻求更多的安慰。那些她以往用来活跃家庭气氛的、优美的荷兰小曲渐渐消失了。她也时常忘记了自己的针线活，忧愁地看着坐在炉边沉思的父亲的面孔。","Every morning bore testimony to the ravages of the preceding night in cabbages of all ages and conditions, from the tender sprout to the full-grown head, piteously rooted from their quiet beds like worthless weeds, and left to wither in the sunshine.It was in vain Wolfert’s wife remonstrated; it was in vain his darling daughter wept over the destruction of some favorite marygold.“Thou shalt have gold of another guess-sort,” he would cry, chucking her under the chin; “thou shalt have a string of crooked ducats for thy wedding-necklace, my child.”His family began really to fear that the poor man’s wits were diseased.He muttered in his sleep at night of mines of wealth, of pearls and diamonds and bars of gold.In the day-time he was moody and abstracted, and walked about as if in a trance.Dame Webber held frequent councils with all the old women of the neighborhood, not omitting the parish dominie; scarce an hour in the day but a knot of them might be seen wagging their white caps together round her door, while the poor woman made some piteous recital.The daughter, too, was fain to seek for more frequent consolation from the stolen interviews of her favored swain, Dirk Waldron.The delectable little Dutch songs with which she used to dulcify the house grew less and less frequent, and she would forget her sewing and look wistfully in her father’s face as he sat pondering by the fireside."
"一天，沃尔弗特看到她焦虑地盯着自己的眼神，就暂时从他的黄金梦中醒过来。“高兴起来，我的孩子，”他兴高采烈地说，“你为什么消沉呢？——终有一天你将会与斯切纳霍恩、范霍恩、范达姆家的人一样昂起头来——连大庄园主自己也会为能有你这样的儿媳妇而高兴的！”","Wolfert caught her eye one day fixed on him thus anxiously, and for a moment was roused from his golden reveries—“Cheer up, my girl,” said he, exultingly, “why dost thou droop?—thou shalt hold up thy head one day with the—and the Schenaerhorns, the Van Hornes, and the Van Dams—the patroon himself shall be glad to get thee for his son!”"
"埃米对于这些极度自负的吹嘘摇了摇头，更加怀疑这个善良的人心智不健全。","Amy shook her head at this vain-glorious boast, and was more than ever in doubt of the soundness of the good man’s intellect."
"同时，沃尔弗特在继续挖掘。但是这片田地很广阔，而他的梦境也没有指出具体的位置，他不得不漫无目的地挖。在他连这片充满希望的土地的十分之一都还没有挖完的时候，冬天来临了。土地被冻得很硬，夜晚也变得很寒冷，这让他无法继续挖掘。然而，春天一回暖，土地刚松动，小青蛙刚开始在草地里鸣叫的时候，沃尔弗特先生就重新带着热情投入到这项劳动中。然而，工作时间仍然是以夜当日。与往日整天高兴地工作，种植、栽培自己的蔬菜相反，他现在白天都无所事事地沉思着，直到夜幕降临，召唤他开始他的秘密劳作。就这样，他夜复一夜、周复一周、年复一年地挖掘着，但却连个小钱都没挖着。相反，他在挖掘上投入的精力越多，他就变得越穷。他菜园里那些肥沃的土壤都被他挖走了，底层的沙子、碎砾都被他翻到表层，最终整个园地都呈现出黄沙遍地、一片荒芜的景象。","In the meantime Wolfert went on digging, but the field was extensive, and as his dream had indicated no precise spot, he had to dig at random.The winter set in before one-tenth of the scene of promise had been explored.The ground became too frozen and the nights too cold for the labors of the spade.No sooner, however, did the returning warmth of spring loosen the soil, and the small frogs begin to pipe in the meadows, but Wolfert resumed his labors with renovated zeal.Still, however, the hours of industry were reversed.Instead of working cheerily all day, planting and setting out his vegetables, he remained thoughtfully idle, until the shades of night summoned him to his secret labors.In this way he continued to dig from night to night, and week to week, and month to month, but not a stiver did he find.On the contrary, the more he digged the poorer he grew.The rich soil of his garden was digged away, and the sand and gravel from beneath were thrown to the surface, until the whole field presented an aspect of sandy barrenness."
"与此同时，季节也在不断地变化。早春时曾在草地里鸣叫的小青蛙，在盛夏的时候像牛蛙一样在小溪里呱呱叫，然后又归于沉寂。桃树也从发芽、开花到了结果的时候。燕子和紫崖燕飞回来了，在屋顶上叽叽喳喳，建造鸟巢，培育幼仔，沿着屋檐开大会，然后又展翅飞行，开始寻求另一个春天。毛虫织着它的裹尸布，把自己裹在里面，在给房屋遮阳的大梧桐树上吊着，然后变成了蛾，在夏日的最后一缕阳光中拍着翅膀，最后消失了；最后梧桐树的叶子也慢慢变黄，再变成褐色，最后一片一片带着沙沙的响声落到地上，在风和尘土的小漩涡中旋转着，悄悄地说着冬天就要来了。","In the meantime the seasons gradually rolled on.The little frogs that had piped in the meadows in early spring, croaked as bull-frogs in the brooks during the summer heats, and then sunk into silence.The peach tree budded, blossomed, and bore its fruit.The swallows and martins came, twittered about the roof, built their nests, reared their young, held their congress along the eaves, and then winged their flight in search of another spring.The caterpillar spun its winding-sheet, dangled in it from the great buttonwood tree that shaded the house, turned into a moth, fluttered with the last sunshine of summer, and disappeared; and finally the leaves of the buttonwood tree turned yellow, then brown, then rustled one by one to the ground, and whirling about in little eddies of wind and dust, whispered that winter was at hand."
"到年底的时候，沃尔弗特渐渐地从他的发财梦中醒过来。他什么作物都没有种植，因而也无法满足家庭所需以度过这个贫瘠的冬天。冬季漫长又残酷，这家人第一次在真正意义上不能舒适地度过冬天。沃尔弗特脑海中的想法逐渐发生了剧变，正如那些黄金梦被痛苦的现实所打乱的人一样。他最终会困苦不堪这一想法慢慢地浮上他的心头。他已经认为自己失去了数不清的、未发现的财宝，是这个州最不幸的人之一；而现在，成千上万英镑都躲避他的探寻，以至于让他为了几个先令和便士感到为难，这是极度残忍的。","Wolfert gradually awoke from his dream of wealth as the year declined.He had reared no crop to supply the wants of his household during the sterility of winter.The season was long and severe, and for the first time the family was really straightened in its comforts.By degrees a revulsion of thought took place in Wolfert’s mind, common to those whose golden dreams have been disturbed by pinching realities.The idea gradually stole upon him that he should come to want.He already considered himself one of the most unfortunate men in the province, having lost such an incalculable amount of undiscovered treasure, and now, when thousands of pounds had eluded his search, to be perplexed for shillings and pence was cruel in the extreme."
"疲惫和忧愁浮上他的眉头。他带着四处找钱的神色来回走动，低着眼睛，似乎要看到土里去；手插在口袋里，就像那些口袋里没有其他东西可放的人喜欢做的那样。他经过市救济院的时候，都要带着悔恨看两眼，似乎那注定是他未来的住所。","Haggard care gathered about his brow; he went about with a money-seeking air, his eyes bent downwards into the dust, and carrying his hands in his pockets, as men are apt to do when they have nothing else to put into them.He could not even pass the city almshouse without giving it a rueful glance, as if destined to be his future abode."
"他古怪的行为和表情引起了不少猜测和议论。很长一段时间内，人们都以为他疯了，然后所有人都同情他；最后人们怀疑他穷了，所有的人都躲避他。","The strangeness of his conduct and of his looks occasioned much speculation and remark.For a long time he was suspected of being crazy, and then every body pitied him; at length it began to be suspected that he was poor, and then every body avoided him."
"在他来访时，那些有钱的老熟人在门外会见他，在门槛上热情地招待他，他离开的时候亲切地拍着他的手，在他走后又摇摇头，带着善良的表情，似乎在说“可怜的沃尔弗特”。当他们在大街上散步偶然碰见他走近时，他们会敏捷地绕道而行。即使是邻近的理发师、修鞋匠，以及附近巷子里衣衫褴褛的裁缝——这三种世界上最穷却又最愉快的人，也用那种通常看一无所有的人才有的、满是同情的眼神看他。毫无疑问，如果这些人的口袋不是空空如也，他们甚至会把自己的口袋交给他。","The rich old burghers of his acquaintance met him outside of the door when he called, entertained him hospitably on the threshold, pressed him warmly by the hand on parting, shook their heads as he walked away, with the kind-hearted expression of “poor Wolfert,” and turned a corner nimbly, if by chance they saw him approaching as they walked the streets.Even the barber and cobbler of the neighborhood, and a tattered tailor in an alley hard by, three of the poorest and merriest rogues in the world, eyed him with that abundant sympathy which usually attends a lack of means, and there is not a doubt but their pockets would have been at his command, only that they happened to be empty."
"因此所有的人都远离韦伯家，好像贫穷会像瘟疫一样传染。这些人中，只有诚实的德克·沃尔德伦还与他的女儿继续幽会，好像他的情人家境越衰落，他就会越喜欢她一样。","Thus every body deserted the Webber mansion, as if poverty were contagious, like the plague; every body but honest Dirk Waldron, who still kept up his stolen visits to the daughter, and indeed seemed to wax more affectionate as the fortunes of his mistress were on the wane."
"沃尔弗特已经数月都没有去过他以前常去的乡村旅馆了。一个星期六的下午，他一个人孤独地走着长长的一段路，冥想着自己的渴望和失望，这时脚步本能地迈向习惯的方向，从幻想中醒悟过来时，他发现自己已经站在旅馆门前了。他为是否要进去犹豫了一会儿，但是他的心灵渴望陪伴。一个破产的人除了客栈还能找到更好的慰藉吗？那儿既没有严肃的榜样，也没有严肃的忠告使他感到难堪。","Many months had elapsed since Wolfert had frequented his old resort, the rural inn.He was taking a long lonely walk one Saturday afternoon, musing over his wants and disappointments, when his feet took instinctively their wonted direction, and on awaking out of a reverie, he found himself before the door of the inn.For some moments he hesitated whether to enter, but his heart yearned for companionship; and where can a ruined man find better companionship than at a tavern, where there is neither sober example nor sober advice to put him out of countenance?"
"沃尔弗特发现客栈的一些老顾客们还保持着往常的姿势，坐在自己往常的座位上，但是有一个人不见了——伟大的拉姆·拉普里。多年来，他一直占据着这个豪华的椅子上。他的位置被一个陌生人取代了。然而，这个人坐在椅子上，呆在客栈里，却完全像在自己家一样。他比较矮小，却有着厚胸膛，方方正正、肌肉发达。他宽阔的肩膀、双关节、弯曲的膝盖，都显示出他力大无穷。他的脸饱经风霜，面色暗沉。一道深深的疤——好像是短刀划的——几乎划开他的鼻子，在他的上嘴唇上留下一道伤口。透过上嘴唇，他的牙齿像牛头犬的牙齿一样闪耀着。那一头铁灰色的头发使他凶恶的容貌看起来灰灰的。他的服装是一种水陆两用的式样。他戴着一顶旧帽子——边沿处的饰带已经失去光泽，帽子像军队里那样歪在一边，只遮住了半边头；他穿着件褪色的蓝色军衣，上面是黄铜色纽扣，下身是宽松的短衬裤，或者说是马裤，因为它们都堆在膝盖那里。他用权威的口气命令他身边的每个人，说话声音很洪亮，像锅下烧着的荆棘的爆裂声；他毫无顾忌地咒骂着店主和仆人，他们却谄媚地候在一边，就连对伟大的拉姆本人，他们都没有这样过。","Wolfert found several of the old frequenters of the tavern at their usual posts, and seated in their usual places; but one was missing, the great Ramm Rapelye, who for many years had filled the chair of state.His place was supplied by a stranger, who seemed, however, completely at home in the chair and the tavern.He was rather under-size, but deep-chested, square, and muscular.His broad shoulders, double joints, and bow-knees, gave tokens of prodigious strength.His face was dark and weather-beaten; a deep scar, as if from the slash of a cutlass, had almost divided his nose, and made a gash in his upper lip, through which his teeth shone like a bull-dog’s.A mass of iron gray hair gave a grizzly finish to his hard-favored visage.His dress was of an amphibious character.He wore an old hat edged with tarnished lace, and cocked in martial style, on one side of his head; a rusty blue military coat with brass buttons, and a wide pair of short petticoat trousers, or rather breeches, for they were gathered up at the knees.He ordered every body about him with an authoritative air; talked in a brattling voice, that sounded like the crackling of thorns under a pot; damned the landlord and servants with perfect impunity, and was waited upon with greater obsequiousness than had ever been shown to the mighty Ramm himself."
"沃尔弗特的好奇心驱使他想知道这个陌生人是谁，做什么的，居然能在这个古老的领域里获得绝对的统治地位。然而，除了模糊的信息之外，他什么都没有得到。皮切·普劳把他拉到一边，到了大厅的一个偏僻角落，极为谨慎地低声透露了他所知道的有关这个人的一切。几个月前，在一个漆黑的风雨交加的晚上，旅馆里的人被反复出现的长长的喊声吵醒 ，那声音就像是狼的咆哮。那声音来自海边，最后终于听出是有人在用航海的方式朝着房子吆喝：“哟呵，房子！”店主和他那领班，兼酒保，兼马夫，兼跑堂——也就是他的老黑人卡夫——一起出来了。当走近声音传来的地方时，他们就在水边发现了这个像两栖生物的人，他独自一人坐在一个航海用的大橡木箱子上。他是怎么来的，是不是坐某个小船到达岸上，或是坐着这个箱子漂上岸，这都无人知晓。因为他似乎并不想回答问题，而且从他的表情和态度可以看出，他禁止一切提问。这么说吧，他占据了客栈角落的一个房间，并费了好大劲将他的箱子也搬到了那儿。从此以后他就一直呆在这里，只在客栈及其附近走动。确实，有时候他会一次消失一天、两天或三天，出去又回来，却从来都不通知任何人，也不谈事情的经过。他总是有很多钱的样子，却那通常是一些稀奇古怪的货币。他总是在每晚睡觉之前先付账。","Wolfert’s curiosity was awakened to know who and what was this stranger who had thus usurped absolute sway in this ancient domain.He could get nothing, however, but vague information.Peechy Prauw took him aside, into a remote corner of the hall, and there in an under-voice, and with great caution, imparted to him all that he knew on the subject.The inn had been aroused several months before, on a dark stormy night, by repeated long shouts, that seemed like the howlings of a wolf.They came from the water-side; and at length were distinguished to be hailing the house in the seafaring manner.“House-a-hoy!”The landlord turned out with his head-waiter, tapster, hostler, and errand boy—that is to say with his old negro Cuff.On approaching the place from whence the voice proceeded, they found this amphibious-looking personage at the water’s edge, quite alone, and seated on a great oaken sea-chest.How he came there, whether he had been set on shore from some boat, or had floated to land on his chest, nobody could tell, for he did not seem disposed to answer questions, and there was something in his looks and manners that put a stop to all questioning.Suffice it to say, he took possession of a corner room of the inn, to which his chest was removed with great difficulty.Here he had remained ever since, keeping about the inn and its vicinity.Sometimes, it is true, he disappeared for one, two, or three days at a time, going and returning without giving any notice or account of his movements.He always appeared to have plenty of money, though often of very strange, outlandish coinage; and he regularly paid his bill every evening before turning in."
"他把房间按照自己的喜好布置了一下，他不睡普通的床，而是从房顶上挂下来一个吊床，还用生锈的手枪和外国造的短剑装饰了墙壁。他大部分时间都是在这个房间度过的。坐在窗户边，他就能看见松德海峡的开阔景色。他坐着，嘴里叼着一个过时的短烟斗，肘边放着一杯朗姆棕榈酒，手上拿一个袖珍望远镜，通过望远镜他能侦察到河上经过的每艘船。大的横帆船几乎不能引起他的注意；但是他一看到羊肩形的三角帆船，或是驳船，或小帆船，或小艇出现在地平线上时，就会举起望远镜，一丝不苟地仔细查看。","He had fitted up his room to his own fancy, having slung a hammock from the ceiling instead of a bed, and decorated the walls with rusty pistols and cutlasses of foreign workmanship.A great part of his time was passed in this room, seated by the window, which commanded a wide view of the Sound, a short old-fashioned pipe in his mouth, a glass of rum toddy at his elbow, and a pocket telescope in his hand, with which he reconnoitred every boat that moved upon the water.Large square-rigged vessels seemed to excite but little attention; but the moment he descried any thing with a shoulder-of-mutton sail, or that a barge, or yawl, or jolly boat hove in sight, up went the telescope, and he examined it with the most scrupulous attention."
"所有这些本可以悄无声息地过去，因为那时这个州成了各种性格、各种地方的冒险人物爱来的地方，任何穿着或行为古怪的人都很难引起他们的注意。但是没过多久，这个莫名其妙地降临到陆地的海洋怪兽，开始挑战这个地方长久以来的风俗，冒犯这里的老顾客，以独裁的方式干涉九柱戏场地和酒吧的所有事情，直到最后他绝对控制了这个小客栈。要对抗他的权威是徒劳的。他并不太喜欢吵架，但却狂暴又专横，就像是后甲板区习惯实行暴政的人一样。他的一切言行都带着鲁莽大胆的神气，这使所有的旁观者都小心翼翼。即使那拿一半薪水的军官——他一直以来都是这个俱乐部的英雄，也因为他而立刻变得沉默；那些安静的市民们惊讶地看着这个易怒的战士如此容易、平稳地被制服了。","All this might have passed without much notice, for in those times the province was so much the resort of adventurers of all characters and climes that any oddity in dress or behavior attracted but little attention.But in a little while this strange sea monster, thus strangely cast up on dry land, began to encroach upon the long-established customs and customers of the place; to interfere in a dictatorial manner in the affairs of the ninepin alley and the bar-room, until in the end he usurped an absolute command over the little inn.It was in vain to attempt to withstand his authority.He was not exactly quarrelsome, but boisterous and peremptory, like one accustomed to tyrannize on a quarter deck; and there was a dare-devil air about every thing he said and did, that inspired a wariness in all bystanders.Even the half-pay officer, so long the hero of the club, was soon silenced by him; and the quiet burghers stared with wonder at seeing their inflammable man of war so readily and quietly extinguished."
"接着他所讲的那些故事都能使温顺的人毛骨悚然。在过去的二十年里，每一场海战、抢劫或是海盗的冒险，他似乎都了如指掌。他很乐意讲西印度群岛和西班牙海上的海盗的壮举。当他讲到伏击金银船、绝望的战斗、桁端挨着桁端——舷侧挨着舷侧——登上并俘获西班牙大帆船时，他的眼睛别提有多亮了！他讲到对富庶的西班牙殖民地进行突袭、抢劫教堂、洗劫修道院时，总是低声轻笑，讲得津津有味。当他描述自己如何用火烤一个西班牙人，逼他交出财宝时，你简直以为自己在听某个狼吞虎咽的人细说米迦勒节上烤美味鹅肉的情形——细节也讲得非常详细，使在场每个富有的老市民都如坐针毡。所有这些都是他带着无限欢乐讲出来的，好像在他眼里这是一个精彩的笑话；然后他会霸道地瞥邻座一眼，那个可怜的人由于懦弱，不得不跟着傻笑。可是，如果有人胆敢反驳他的任何故事，他就会马上发火。他那歪在一边的帽子也会刹那间凶猛起来，好像憎恨这种反驳似的。——“见鬼，你怎么可能知道得像我这么清楚？事实就是我说的那样！”同时他还肆意说出一连串雷鸣般的咒骂和许多水手的行话，这些话在这个平静的客栈里从未被听到过。","And then the tales that he would tell were enough to make a peaceable man’s hair stand on end.There was not a sea fight, or marauding or free-booting adventure that had happened within the last twenty years but he seemed perfectly versed in it.He delighted to talk of the exploits of the buccaneers in the West-Indies and on the Spanish Main.How his eyes would glisten as he described the waylaying of treasure ships, the desperate fights, yardarm and yardarm—broadside and broadside—the boarding and capturing of large Spanish galleons! with what chuckling relish would he describe the descent upon some rich Spanish colony; the rifling of a church; the sacking of a convent!You would have thought you heard some gormandizer dilating upon the roasting of a savory goose at Michaelmas as he described the roasting of some Spanish Don to make him discover his treasure—a detail given with a minuteness that made every rich old burgher present turn uncomfortably in his chair.All this would be told with infinite glee, as if he considered it an excellent joke; and then he would give such a tyrannical leer in the face of his next neighbor, that the poor man would be fain to laugh out of sheer faint-heartedness.If any one, however, pretended to contradict him in any of his stories he was on fire in an instant.His very cocked hat assumed a momentary fierceness, and seemed to resent the contradiction.—“How the devil should you know as well as I!I tell you it was as I say!” and he would at the same time let slip a broadside of thundering oaths and tremendous sea phrases, such as had never been heard before within those peaceful walls."
"事实上，这些富有的市民开始揣测，他不是道听途说，而是非常熟悉这些故事。日复一日，关于他的推测开始变得越来越荒唐，越来越吓人。他怪异的行为，他身上笼罩的神秘感，这一切使得他在大家的眼中变得无法理解。对于他们来说，他就是一种海洋深处的怪物——他是人鱼——是巨兽——是海中怪兽，总而言之，他们不知道他是什么样的人。","Indeed, the worthy burghers began to surmise that he knew more of these stories than mere hearsay.Day after day their conjectures concerning him grew more and more wild and fearful.The strangeness of his manners, the mystery that surrounded him, all made him something incomprehensible in their eyes.He was a kind of monster of the deep to them—he was a merman—he was behemoth—he was leviathan—in short, they knew not what he was."
"这个狂暴的海怪的盛气凌人的神态终于让人不可忍受了。他一点也不尊重人；他会毫不犹豫地与最富有的财主发生矛盾；他独霸着那个神圣的扶手椅，不知什么时候开始那就一直是显赫的拉姆·拉普里的宝座。不，他甚至过份到用粗暴的、开玩笑的语气，在那个伟大的财主背上拍了一下，喝他的棕榈酒，当他的面朝他使眼色，这种事情几乎令人难以置信。从这时开始，拉姆·拉普里再也没有出现在这个客栈；随后，最有知名度的几个顾客也不来了，这些人太有钱，忍受不了被人恐吓不敢发表意见，或是被迫为别人的笑话陪笑的场面。客栈老板几乎绝望了，但他不知道该如何摆脱这个海怪及他的箱子——它像是变成了他旅店里的固定装置，或是长在旅店里的东西。","The domineering spirit of this boisterous sea urchin at length grew quite intolerable.He was no respecter of persons; he contradicted the richest burghers without hesitation; he took possession of the sacred elbow chair, which time out of mind had been the seat of sovereignty of the illustrious Ramm Rapelye.Nay, he even went so far in one of his rough jocular moods, as to slap that mighty burgher on the back, drink his toddy and wink in his face, a thing scarcely to be believed.From this time Ramm Rapelye appeared no more at the inn; his example was followed by several of the most eminent customers, who were too rich to tolerate being bullied out of their opinions, or being obliged to laugh at another man’s jokes.The landlord was almost in despair, but he knew not how to get rid of this sea monster and his sea-chest, which seemed to have grown like fixtures, or excrescences on his establishment."
"这些就是讲述者——皮切·普劳——小心地对他耳语的内容。他拉着沃尔弗特的纽扣呆在大厅的角落里，不时地朝酒吧的门谨慎地看一眼，唯恐被他故事里那个恐怖的主角无意中听到。","Such was the account whispered cautiously in Wolfert’s ear, by the narrator, Peechy Prauw, as he held him by the button in a corner of the hall, casting a wary glance now and then towards the door of the bar-room, lest he should be overheard by the terrible hero of his tale."
"沃尔弗特无声地在房间里一个较远的座位上坐下来，对这位如此熟知海盗史的不知名人士有深深的敬畏。对他来说，这是一个伟大帝国的革命的精彩例子，令人敬重的拉姆·拉普里就这样被夺了宝座；一个粗犷的水手在他的扶椅上发号施令，欺凌这些德高望重的老人们，使这个安静的小旅馆充斥着争吵和虚张声势的举动。","Wolfert took his seat in a remote part of the room in silence; impressed with profound awe of this unknown, so versed in freebooting history.It was to him a wonderful instance of the revolutions of mighty empires, to find the venerable Ramm Rapelye thus ousted from the throne; a rugged tarpaulin dictating from his elbow chair, hectoring the patriarchs, and filling this tranquil little realm with brawl and bravado."
"这个陌生人今天晚上用比往常更爱说话，正讲述着公海上发生的诸多令人震惊的烧杀抢掠的故事。他津津有味地讲着，越是那些会让安静的听众害怕的可怕细节，他越是添油加醋地讲。他狂妄自大地详细讲述了一个西班牙商船被俘获的经过。一个漫长的夏日，那艘船静静地停靠在一个小岛附近，而这个小岛正是海盗们的一个潜伏地。海盗们已经在岸上用望远镜侦察了一番，确认了船的特征与武装力量。晚上，一伙精心挑选出来的勇猛海盗们驾着捕鲸船向它驶去。他们压着桨声前进，此刻那艘船正随着海水的波动摇摆着停在那儿，上面的帆拍打着桅杆。甲板上的守卫发现他们在靠近的时候，他们已经离这艘船的船尾很近。警报拉响了；海盗们朝甲板上扔手榴弹，手里拿着刀，顺着主锚的铁索攀爬上去。","The stranger was on this evening in a more than usually communicative mood, and was narrating a number of astounding stories of plunderings and burnings upon the high seas.He dwelt upon them with peculiar relish, heightening the frightful particulars in proportion to their effect on his peaceful auditors.He gave a long swaggering detail of the capture of a Spanish merchantman.She was laying becalmed during a long summer’s day, just off from an island which was one of the lurking places of the pirates.They had reconnoitred her with their spy-glasses from the shore, and ascertained her character and force.At night a picked crew of daring fellows set off for her in a whale boat.They approached with muffled oars, as she lay rocking idly with the undulations of the sea and her sails flapping against the masts.They were close under her stern before the guard on deck was aware of their approach.The alarm was given; the pirates threw hand grenades on deck and sprang up the main chains sword in hand."
"船员们急忙去拿武器，但是混乱之中一些人被击倒，一些人在顶部避难，一些人被追到船外淹死，还有一些人徒手对抗，从主甲板被逼到后甲板，英勇争夺着每一寸领地。船上有三个带着夫人的西班牙贵族，他们抗争得最拼命；他们守护着升降口，砍倒了几个进攻者，像疯了一样战斗着，因为他们被船舱里传来的女人的尖叫声激怒了。其中一个已经上了年纪的贵族很快就被击倒了。其余两个还在竭力守护自己的领地，尽管海盗头也在朝他们进攻。就在这时，从主甲板上传来胜利的欢呼。“这船是我们的了！”海盗们呼喊着。","The crew flew to arms, but in great confusion some were shot down, others took refuge in the tops; others were driven overboard and drowned, while others fought hand to hand from the main deck to the quarter deck, disputing gallantly every inch of ground.There were three Spanish gentlemen on board with their ladies, who made the most desperate resistance; they defended the companion-way, cut down several of their assailants, and fought like very devils, for they were maddened by the shrieks of the ladies from the cabin.One of the Dons was old and soon despatched.The other two kept their ground vigorously, even though the captain of the pirates was among their assailants.Just then there was a shout of victory from the main deck.“The ship is ours!” cried the pirates."
"其中一个贵族立即弃刀投降；另外一个是个急躁的年轻人，刚结婚不久，他在海盗头目的脸上划了一刀，把整个脸都划开了。海盗头只说了一句话：“绝不轻饶。”","One of the Dons immediately dropped his sword and surrendered; the other, who was a hot-headed youngster, and just married, gave the captain a slash in the face that laid all open.The captain just made out to articulate the words “no quarter.”"
"“那他们怎么处理俘虏呢？”皮切·普劳急切地说。","“And what did they do with their prisoners?” said Peechy Prauw, eagerly."
"“把他们全扔到海里！”人鱼说道。","“Threw them all overboard!” said the merman."
"紧接着这个回答之后，是死一般的沉寂。皮切·普劳悄悄地缩回去，像是一个一不留神溜进了睡狮洞穴的人。那些老实的市民们恐惧地瞟了一眼这个陌生人脸上的那道深疤，然后将他们的椅子稍微挪远了些。然而，那个水手不动声色地继续抽着烟，好像他一点也没有察觉到，也不认为这些对他的听众产生了不利影响。","A dead pause followed this reply.Peechy Prauw shrunk quietly back like a man who had unwarily stolen upon the lair of a sleeping lion.The honest burghers cast fearful glances at the deep scar slashed across the visage of the stranger, and moved their chairs a little farther off.The seaman, however, smoked on without moving a muscle, as though he either did not perceive or did not regard the unfavorable effect he had produced upon his hearers."
"那个领半薪的军官第一个打破了沉默，因为他一直试图要抵抗这个海上暴君，并重新获得自己昔日在这些老朋友们心中的地位，尽管这种抵抗徒劳无功。现在，他讲了同样惊人的其他故事，想要跟陌生人所讲的带有火药味的故事比一下。像往常一样，基德是他故事的主人公。他好像收集了许多这个州流行的、关于基德的传说。那个水手总是对这个红脸的斗士有着固有的愠怒。这次他听得格外不耐烦。他一只手叉腰坐在那儿，另一只胳膊肘放在桌子上，手里拿着小烟斗，怒气冲冲地吐着烟，并且两腿交叉，一只脚在地上敲着，不时地像蛇怪似的斜瞟一眼那乏味的船长。最后，这个船长讲到基德和他的一些船员沿着哈得孙河而上，将他的战利品秘密卸下。","The half-pay officer was the first to break the silence; for he was continually tempted to make ineffectual head against this tyrant of the seas, and to regain his lost consequence in the eyes of his ancient companions.He now tried to match the gunpowder tales of the stranger by others equally tremendous.Kidd, as usual, was his hero, concerning whom he had picked up many of the floating traditions of the province.The seaman had always evinced a settled pique against the red-faced warrior.On this occasion he listened with peculiar impatience.He sat with one arm a-kimbo, the other elbow on a table, the hand holding on to the small pipe he was pettishly puffing; his legs crossed, drumming with one foot on the ground and casting every now and then the side glance of a basilisk at the prosing captain.At length the latter spoke of Kidd’s having ascended the Hudson with some of his crew, to land his plunder in secrecy."
"“基德沿着哈得孙河而上！”那个水手突然爆发，大声咒骂道，“基德从来没有沿着哈得孙河上去过！”","“Kidd up the Hudson!” burst forth the seaman, with a tremendous oath;“Kidd never was up the Hudson!”"
"“我告诉你他去过。”对方说道。“是的，而且他们还说他把一些财宝埋在一小块伸到河心的平地上，那地方叫做德弗尔斯丹斯卡莫。”","“I tell you he was,” said the other.“Aye, and they say he buried a quantity of treasure on the little flat that runs out into the river, called the Devil’s Dans Kammer.”"
"“你说的什么德弗尔斯丹斯卡莫！”水手叫道，“我告诉你，基德从来没有沿着哈得孙河而上——见鬼，你知道什么关于基德和他的出没地？”","“The Devil’s Dans Kammer in your teeth!” cried the seaman.“I tell you Kidd never was up the Hudson—what the plague do you know of Kidd and his haunts?”"
"“我知道什么？”拿半薪的军官重复道，“哼，他受审判的时候我正在伦敦，是的，我还有幸看到他被绞死在行刑码头。”","“What do I know?” echoed the half-pay officer; “why, I was in London at the time of his trial, aye, and I had the pleasure of seeing him hanged at Execution Dock.”"
"“那么，先生，我来告诉你，你看到的是一个好汉被绞死，确实是！”他将他的脸凑近军官，“而且有许多旁观的懦夫，他们反而更应该替他去受刑。”","“Then, sir, let me tell you that you saw as pretty a fellow hanged as ever trod shoe leather. Aye!” putting his face nearer to that of the officer, “and there was many a coward looked on, that might much better have swung in his stead.”"
"拿半薪的军官沉默了，但是怒火却在他胸中压抑着，在他的独眼中猛烈地燃烧着，像是点燃的木炭一样。","The half-pay officer was silenced; but the indignation thus pent up in his bosom glowed with intense vehemence in his single eye, which kindled like a coal."
"皮切·普劳，这个从来都不会安静的人，现在开始接过话来，用抚慰的口气说这个先生确实是对的。基德从来没有在哈得孙上游埋过钱，也没有在这一带的任何地方埋过，尽管许多人都肯定那是事实。藏钱的是布雷迪什和其他海盗。有的人说藏在海龟湾，有的人说在长岛，还有人说在鬼门关附近。确实，他又说，我想起许多年以前那个黑人渔夫——马德·萨姆的一次历险，一些人认为这跟海盗有些关系。既然我们都是朋友，这个故事也不会流传出去，我就告诉你们。","Peechy Prauw, who never could remain silent, now took up the word, and in a pacifying tone observed that the gentleman certainly was in the right.Kidd never did bury money up the Hudson, nor indeed in any of those parts, though many affirm the fact.It was Bradish and others of the buccaneers who had buried money, some said in Turtle Bay, others on Long-Island, others in the neighborhood of Hell Gate.Indeed, added he, I recollect an adventure of Mud Sam, the negro fisherman, many years ago, which some think had something to do with the buccaneers.As we are all friends here, and as it will go no farther, I’ll tell it to you."
"“许多年以前一个漆黑的夜晚，当萨姆从鬼门关打渔回来——”","“Upon a dark night many years ago, as Sam was returning from fishing in Hell Gate—”"
"故事被一个忽然的动作扼杀在萌芽中。那个陌生人用铁拳在桌上一锤，关节向下，默默用力，在桌板上留下了凹痕，同时阴森森地扭头看过去，露出冷笑，像发怒的熊一样。“邻居们，你们听着，”他说道，并意味深长地点着头，“你们还是别提那些海盗和他们的钱了——他们可不是给老头老太太们瞎管的。他们为这些钱而奋勇作战，他们为了钱出卖了身体和灵魂，不管钱藏在哪儿，请放心，谁想拿到它，他都得跟魔鬼较量一番。”","Here the story was nipped in the bud by a sudden movement from the unknown, who, laying his iron fist on the table, knuckles downward, with a quiet force that indented the very boards, and looking grimly over his shoulder, with the grin of an angry bear.“Heark’ee, neighbor,” said he, with significant nodding of the head, “you’d better let the buccaneers and their money alone—they’re not for old men and old women to meddle with.They fought hard for their money, they gave body and soul for it, and wherever it lies buried, depend upon it he must have a tug with the devil who gets it.”"
"这突然的爆发使得整个屋子一片沉寂。皮切·普劳的心缩了一缩，甚至那个红脸的军官也脸色发白。沃尔弗特呆在房间的一个阴暗角落里，怀着强烈的热情听了关于地下宝藏的这一切，带着敬畏与崇敬看着这个勇猛的海盗，因为他的确怀疑他就是一个海盗。在他所有关于西班牙海的故事里，都有金子的声音和珠宝的光芒，这使得他的每一句话都有了价值。沃尔弗特甚至想不惜一切地把那个笨重的箱子搜一番，在他的想象中，那个箱子装满了金质圣杯和耶稣受难像，以及被达布隆塞得鼓鼓的、让人一看就高兴的钱袋。","This sudden explosion was succeeded by a blank silence throughout the room.Peechy Prauw shrunk within himself, and even the red-faced officer turned pale.Wolfert, who, from a dark corner of the room, had listened with intense eagerness to all this talk about buried treasure, looked with mingled awe and reverence on this bold buccaneer, for such he really suspected him to be.There was a chinking of gold and a sparkling of jewels in all his stories about the Spanish Main that gave a value to every period, and Wolfert would have given any thing for the rummaging of the ponderous sea-chest, which his imagination crammed full of golden chalices and crucifixes and jolly round bags of doubloons."
"之前屋子里死一般的沉寂最后被陌生人打破了，他拿出了一个用古老、奇怪的工艺制成的巨大手表，在沃尔弗特看来，这显然是西班牙的样式。他按了下弹簧，表敲到十点钟。这时水手喊结账，并从一把奇怪的硬币中取出一些来付账。他喝光了剩下的酒，也没有向任何人告别，摇晃着走出了房间，喃喃自语着爬山楼梯，回到房间。","The dead stillness that had fallen upon the company was at length interrupted by the stranger, who pulled out a prodigious watch of curious and ancient workmanship, and which in Wolferts’ eyes had a decidedly Spanish look.On touching a spring it struck ten o’clock; upon which the sailor called for his reckoning, and having paid it out of a handful of outlandish coin, he drank off the remainder of his beverage, and without taking leave of any one, rolled out of the room, muttering to himself as he stamped up-stairs to his chamber."
"过了好一会儿，大伙们才从刚才的沉寂中恢复过来。而陌生人不时地在房间里来回走动，传来的脚步声令人敬畏。","It was some time before the company could recover from the silence into which they had been thrown.The very footsteps of the stranger, which were heard now and then as he traversed his chamber, inspired awe."
"尽管如此，刚才谈的话题太有趣了，于是大家又继续谈论。在他们谈得起劲时，外面却不知不觉地下起了暴雨，刮起了大风。大雨也制止了所有人回家的念头，直到暴风雨平息。因此，他们靠得更近了些，恳请可敬的皮切·普劳继续刚才被无礼打断的故事。他很乐意地照办了，不过却是低声地、用一种几乎刚盖过他呼吸的语调讲着，偶尔他的声音被滚滚雷声淹没。当听到头上的陌生人沉重的脚步声时，他不时地停下来，带着明显的敬畏听着。","Still the conversation in which they had been engaged was too interesting not to be resumed.A heavy thunder-gust had gathered up unnoticed while they were lost in talk, and the torrents of rain that fell forbade all thoughts of setting off for home until the storm should subside.They drew nearer together, therefore, and entreated the worthy Peechy Prauw to continue the tale which had been so discourteously interrupted.He readily complied, whispering, however, in a tone scarcely above his breath, and drowned occasionally by the rolling of the thunder, and he would pause every now and then, and listen with evident awe, as he heard the heavy footsteps of the stranger pacing overhead."
"接下来就是这个故事的大意。","The following is the purport of his story."
