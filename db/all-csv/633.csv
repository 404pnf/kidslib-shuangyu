"第二块血迹","The Adventure of the Second Stain"
"写完《福田宅邸》之后，我本来打算就此封笔，不再向公众介绍我朋友歇洛克·福尔摩斯先生的辉煌成就。我这个决定并不是因为缺乏素材，我的笔记里还有千百件我从未提及的案子，也不是因为读者诸君已经兴味索然，不再关注这位非凡人物的卓荦个性和独特方法，真正的原因在于，福尔摩斯先生已经明确表示，不希望我继续发表他的事迹。当他还在从事实际的侦探工作的时候，关于他成功案例的报道可以带给他一些实际的益处。可是，如今他已经毅然决然地离开伦敦，遁入萨塞克斯丘陵[^1]，以研究工作和蜜蜂养殖自娱。此种情形之下，他自然对无谓的声名深恶痛绝，并且不由分说地要求我尊重他对这件事情的看法，不能有任何违拗。不过，我还是向他提出抗议，告诉他我已经承诺读者，一俟时机成熟就会发表“第二块血迹案”[^2]，同时又向他指出，在他应邀侦办的所有国际性案件当中，这件案子最为重大，十分适合成为这个漫长系列的收山之作。这样一来，我最终征得了他的同意，可以将经过慎重修饰的案情记述呈现在公众面前。故事之中若有含混模糊之处，实在也是不得不然，相信公众可以谅解。","I had intended “The Adventure of the AbbeyGrange” to be the last of those exploits of my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, which I should ever communicate to the public. This resolution of mine was not due to any lack of material, since I have notes of many hundreds of cases to which I have never alluded, nor was it caused by any waning interest on the part of my readers in the singular personality and unique methods of this remarkable man. The real reason lay in the reluctance which Mr. Holmes has shown to the continued publication of his experiences. So long as he was in actual professional practice the records of his successes were of some practical value to him; but since he has definitely retired from London and betaken himself to study and bee-farming on the Sussex Downs, notoriety has become hateful to him, and he has peremptorily requested that his wishes in this matter should be strictly observed. It was only upon my representing to him that I had given a promise that “The Adventure of the Second Stain” should be published when the times were ripe, and pointing out to him that it is only appropriate that this long series of episodes should culminate in the most important international case which he has ever been called upon to handle, that I at last succeeded in obtaining his consent that a carefullyguarded account of the incident should at last be laid before the public. If in telling the story I seem to be somewhat vague in certain details the public will readily understand that there is an excellent reason for my reticence."
"我不能透露具体的年份，甚至是具体的年代，因此我只能说，某个年代的某一年，秋天里的某个周二上午，两位闻名全欧的客人大驾光临，踏进了我俩位于贝克街的区区寒舍。其中之一神情严峻，高鼻鹰眼，威仪赫赫，正是两度担任本国首相的贝林格勋爵，另一位则是本国最有前途的政治新星、欧洲事务大臣[^3]特里劳尼·霍普阁下，只见他肤色黝黑，轮廓分明，气度雍容，人虽然未到中年，体格和心智却已臻于完美。他们肩并肩地坐进了我们那把堆满报纸的靠背长椅，两张憔悴焦灼的脸庞明白无误地告诉我们，他们屈驾来访，一定是为了某种至关重要的事情。首相用青筋暴露的枯瘦双手紧紧抓着雨伞的象牙柄，来回打量着我和福尔摩斯，瘦削的脸上阴云密布。欧洲事务大臣则慌慌张张地捋了捋自己的髭须，然后就开始翻来覆去地摆弄穿在表链上的图章。","It was, then, in a year, and even in a decade, that shall be nameless, that upon one Tuesday morning in autumn we found two visitors of European fame within the walls of our humble room in Baker Street. The one, austere, high-nosed, eagle-eyed, and dominant, was none other than the illustrious Lord Bellinger, twice Premier of Britain. The other, dark, clear-cut, and elegant, hardly yet of middle age, and endowed with every beauty of body and of mind, was the Right Honourable Trelawney Hope, Secretary for European Affairs, and the most rising statesman in the country. They sat side by side upon our paper-littered settee, and it was easy to see from their worn and anxious faces that it was business of the most pressing importance which had brought them. The Premier’s thin, blue-veined hands were clasped tightly over the ivory head of his umbrella, and his gaunt, ascetic face looked gloomily from Holmes to me. The European Secretary pulled nervously at his moustache and fidgeted with the seals of his watch-chain."
"“福尔摩斯先生，今天早上八点钟，我发现文件不见了，之后就立刻通知了首相。我们上门拜访，正是首相的提议。”","“When I discovered my loss, Mr. Holmes, which was at eight o’clock this morning, I at once informed the Prime Minister. It was at his suggestion that we have both come to you.”"
"“你们通知警方了吗？”","“Have you informed the police?”"
"“没有，先生，”首相说道，用的正是他那种名闻遐迩的果决口吻。“我们没有这么做，也不可能这么做。长远看来，通知警方无异于通知公众，而这正是我们竭力想要避免的事情。”","“No, sir,” said the Prime Minister, with the quick, decisive manner for which he was famous. “We have not done so, nor is it possible that we should do so. To inform the police must, in the long run, mean to inform the public. This is what we particularly desire to avoid.”"
"“为什么呢，先生？”","“And why, sir?”"
"“因为这份文件关涉极其重大，一旦公之于众，很容易引起——甚至可以说，十之八九会引起——极其严重的全欧争端。不夸张地说，战争与和平就取决于这件事情的结果。如果我们不能通过极其隐秘的方式找回文件的话，那就跟找不回来没有什么两样，因为那些人偷窃文件的唯一目的就是让大众知晓文件的内容。”","“Because the document in question is of such immense importance that its publication might very easily—I might almost say probably—lead to European complications of the utmost moment. It is not too much to say that peace or war may hang upon the issue. Unless its recovery can be attended with the utmost secrecy, then it may as well not be recovered at all, for all that is aimed at by those who have taken it is that its contents should be generally known.”"
"“我明白了。好了，特里劳尼·霍普先生，劳您大驾，给我讲讲文件失窃的详细情形吧。”","“I understand. Now, Mr. Trelawney Hope, I should be much obliged if you would tell me exactly the circumstances under which this document disappeared.”"
"“几句话就可以讲完，福尔摩斯先生。六天之前，我们收到了这封信，是这样，我们说的文件其实是一位外国君主写来的信。这封信十分重要，我不敢把它留在办公室的保险箱里，每天晚上都会把它装进公文箱，锁上箱子，然后带回我在白厅巷[^4]的住宅，放到我的卧室里面。昨天晚上文件还在，这一点我完全肯定。换衣服准备去吃晚饭的时候，我曾经打开公文箱看过，文件确实是在里面。今天早上，文件却不见了。公文箱整夜都在我卧室梳妆台的镜子旁边，与此同时，我妻子和我都是睡觉很轻的人。我俩都可以发誓，夜里绝不会有人进过卧室。可是，我还得重复一遍，文件确实是不见了。”","“That can be done in a very few words, Mr. Holmes. The letter—for it was a letter from a foreign potentate— was received six days ago. It was of such importance that I have never left it in my safe, but I have taken it across each evening to my house in Whitehall Terrace, and kept it in my bedroom in a locked despatch-box. It was there last night. Of that I am certain. I actually opened the box while I was dressing for dinner, and saw the document inside. This morning it was gone. The despatch-box had stood beside the glass upon my dressing-table all night. I am a light sleeper, and so is my wife. We are both prepared to swear that no one could have entered the room during the night. And yet I repeat that the paper is gone.”"
"“您是什么时间去吃晚饭的呢？”","“What time did you dine?”"
"“七点半。”","“Half-past seven.”"
"“就寝之前，您在卧室外面待了多久？”","“How long was it before you went to bed?”"
"“我妻子看戏去了，我一直在等她回来。十一点半的时候，我俩才一起回房就寝。”","“My wife had gone to the theatre. I waited up for her. It was half-past eleven before we went to our room.”"
"“如此说来，公文箱有四个小时没人看守，对吧？”","“Then for four hours the despatch -box had lain unguarded?”"
"“可以进卧室的只有三个仆人，上房女仆早上可以进去，其他时间只有我的贴身男仆和我妻子的贴身女仆可以进去，他们两个都在我家里待了相当长的时间，品行十分可靠。除此之外，他们都不可能知道，公文箱里还放着比部里的日常公文更有价值的东西。”","“No one is ever permitted to enter that room save the housemaid in the morning, and my valet, or my wife’s maid, during the rest of the day. They are both trusty servants who have been with us for some time. Besides, neither of them could possibly have known that there was anything more valuable than the ordinary departmental papers in my despatch-box.”"
"“那么，知道这封信在箱子里的又有谁呢？”","“Who did know of the existence of that letter?”"
"“我屋里的人都不知道。”","“No one in the house.”"
"“您的妻子总应该知道吧？”","“Surely your wife knew?”"
"“她不知道，先生。今早上发现文件失窃之前，我什么也没跟她说。”","“No, sir; I had said nothing to my wife until I missed the paper this morning.”"
"首相赞许地点了点头。","The Premier nodded approvingly."
"“先生，我一向知道你十分重视自己的公共职责，”他说道，“毫无疑问，手握如此重大的秘密，再亲密的家庭关系也得服从公共职责的需要。”","“I have long known, sir, how high is your sense of public duty,” said he. “I am convinced that in the case of a secret of this importance it would rise superior to the most intimate domestic ties.”"
"欧洲事务大臣微微鞠了一躬。","The European Secretary bowed."
"“您说的正是我的实际行动，先生。直到今天早上为止，这件事我一个字也没告诉我的妻子。”","“You do me no more than justice, sir. Until this morning I have never breathed one word to my wife upon this matter.”"
"“她有没有可能猜到呢？”","“Could she have guessed?”"
"“不可能，福尔摩斯先生，她不可能猜到，其他人也不可能。”","“No, Mr. Holmes, she could not have guessed—nor could anyone have guessed.”"
"“以前您丢过文件吗？”","“Have you lost any documents before?”"
"“没有，先生。”","“No, sir.”"
"“那么，全英格兰范围之内，究竟有哪些人知道这封信的存在呢？”","“Who is there in England who did know of the existence of this letter?”"
"“所有的内阁成员昨天都听说了这封信的事情，不过，每一次的内阁会议都受到保密誓言的约束，这一次的会议还加上了首相本人的郑重叮嘱。天哪，想想吧，刚开完会不过几个小时，我自个儿就把文件给弄丢了！”说到这里，他英俊的面容在绝望之中扭作一团，双手也开始拉扯自己的头发。电光石火之间，我们瞥见了这个人热情冲动、极度敏感的真实天性。不过，他那种贵族式的淡漠面具瞬间恢复，温和节制的嗓音也回到了我们的耳边。“除了内阁成员之外，我部里还有两三名官员知道这封信的事情。我可以跟您保证，福尔摩斯先生，知道这件事情的人，全英格兰就只有这些。”","“Each member of the Cabinet was informed of it yesterday; but the pledge of secrecy which attends every Cabinet meeting was increased by the solemn warning which was given by the Prime Minister. Good heavens, to think that within a few hours I should myself have lost it!” His handsome face was distorted with a spasm of despair, and his hands tore at his hair. For a moment we caught a glimpse of the natural man, impulsive, ardent, keenly sensitive. The next the aristocratic mask was replaced, and the gentle voice had returned. “Besides the members of the Cabinet there are two, or possibly three, departmental officials who know of the letter. No one else in England, Mr. Holmes, I assure you.”"
"“外国呢？”","“But abroad?”"
"“我认为，除了写信的人之外，外国也没有人见过这封信。我完全肯定，写信的人手下的那些大臣——这么说吧，发这封信的时候，写信的人并没有使用正常的官方渠道。”","“I believe that no one abroad has seen it save the man who wrote it. I am well convinced that his Ministers— that the usual official channels have not been employed.”"
"福尔摩斯沉吟了一小会儿。","Holmes considered for some little time."
"“好吧，先生，眼下我必须请您说得具体一点儿。这份文件到底是什么内容，文件失踪的后果为什么会如此严重呢？”","“Now, sir, I must ask you more particularly what this document is, and why its disappearance should have such momentous consequences?”"
"两位政治家飞快地交换了一下眼神，首相的两道浓眉渐渐地拧在了一起。","The two statesmen exchanged a quick glance and the Premier’s shaggy eyebrows gathered in a frown."
"“福尔摩斯先生，这封信装在一个狭长的信封里，信封是淡蓝色的，上面有红色的蜡封，蜡封的图案是一头蹲伏的狮子。信封上的字迹又粗又大，收信人写的是——”","“Mr. Holmes, the envelope is a long, thin one of pale blue colour. There is a seal of red wax stamped with a crouching lion. It is addressed in large, bold handwriting to—”"
"“先生，”福尔摩斯说道，“您说的这些细节非常有趣，事实上还非常重要，可我不得不告诉您，我的调查必须触及那些更为核心的细节。信里究竟写了什么？”","“I fear, sir,” said Holmes, “that, interesting and indeed essential as these details are, my inquiries must go more to the root of things. What *was* the letter?”"
"“这是极其重大的国家机密，恐怕我不能让您知道，再者说，我觉得您并没有必要知道。如果您确实拥有传闻之中的那些本领，能够把我说的这个信封连同信封里的东西一起找回来，那您就为自己的国家作出了巨大的贡献，我们也绝不会吝惜能力范围之内的任何奖赏。”","“That is a State secret of the utmost importance, and I fear that I cannot tell you, nor do I see that it is necessary. If by the aid of the powers which you are said to possess you can find such an envelope as I describe with its enclosure, you will have deserved well of your country, and earned any reward which it lies in our power to bestow.”"
"歇洛克 ·福尔摩斯微笑着站了起来。","Sherlock Holmes rose with a smile."
"“你们是我国最为繁忙的两个人，”他说道，“我这个人虽然微不足道，事情倒也相当不少。非常抱歉，这事情我帮不了你们，再谈下去嘛，也不过是浪费时间而已。”","“You are two of the most busy men in the country,” said he, “and in my own small way I have also a good many calls upon me. I regret exceedingly that I cannot help you in this matter, and any continuation of this interview would be a waste of time.”"
"首相一下子跳了起来，深陷的眼睛里闪出了咄咄逼人的光芒，这样的光芒总是能让他的全体阁员俯首称臣。“我还真是很少听见，先生，”他开口说了半句，但却立刻控制住自己的怒气，坐回了原来的位置。接下来一分多钟的时间里，所有人都默不作声地坐在原地。","The Premier sprang to his feet with that quick, fierce gleam of his deep-set eyes before which a Cabinet has cowered. “I am not accustomed, sir,” he began, but mastered his anger and resumed his seat. For a minute or more we all sat in silence. Then the old statesman shrugged his shoulders."
"年迈的政治家耸了耸肩膀，说道:“我们只能接受您的条件，福尔摩斯先生。毫无疑问，您的意见是对的，如果不能对您推心置腹的话，我们也就没理由要求您采取行动。”","“We must accept your terms, Mr. Holmes. No doubt you are right, and it is unreasonable for us to expect you to act unless we give you our entire confidence.”"
"“我赞同您的意见，先生，”年轻的政治家说道。","“I agree with you, sir,” said the younger statesman."
"“好吧，我这就告诉您，而我这么做，完全是因为我信任您和您同事华生医生的人品。与此同时，我也寄希望于两位的爱国主义精神，因为事情一旦泄露，我们的国家就会面临我所能想象的最严重的灾难。”","“Then I will tell you, relying entirely upon your honour and that of your colleague, Dr. Watson. I may appeal to your patriotism also, for I could not imagine a greater misfortune for the country than that this affair should come out.”"
"“我们绝不会辜负您的信任。”","“You may safely trust us.”"
"“那好，这封信来自某位外国君主，此人对我国在殖民地事务方面取得的一些新成就感到愤愤不平。信写得相当草率，完全是他个人的意见。根据我们的调查，他那些大臣对此事一无所知。这封信的措辞十分令人遗憾，个别语句更是具有极大的煽动性，一旦公之于众，必然会在我国挑起一种极端危险的情绪，进而引发巨大的骚动。我可以毫不含糊地告诉您，先生，这封信一旦泄露，用不了一个星期，我国就会卷入一场大规模的战争。”","“The letter, then, is from a certain foreign potentate who has been ruffled by some recent Colonial developments of this country. It has been written hurriedly and upon his own responsibility entirely. Inquiries have shown that his Ministers know nothing of the matter. At the same time it is couched in so unfortunate a manner, and certain phrases in it are of so provocative a character, that its publication would undoubtedly lead to a most dangerous state of feeling in this country. There would be such a ferment, sir, that I do not hesitate to say that within a week of the publication of that letter this country would be involved in a great war.”"
"福尔摩斯在一张纸片上写了个名字，把纸片递到了首相眼前。","Holmes wrote a name upon a slip of paper and handed it to the Premier."
"“没错，写信的就是他。很有可能，这封信会让我国付出十亿镑的金钱和十万人的生命，眼下呢，不翼而飞的恰恰是这封信。[^5]”","“Exactly. It was he. And it is this letter—this letter which may well mean the expenditure of a thousand millions and the lives of a hundred thousand men—which has become lost in this unaccountable fashion.”"
"“您通知写信的人了吗？”","“Have you informed the sender?”"
"“是的，先生，我们已经给他发了一封密电。”","“Yes, sir, a cipher telegram has been despatched.”"
"“兴许就是他想让这封信公之于众吧。”","“Perhaps he desires the publication of the letter.”"
"“不会的，先生，我们有充分的理由相信，他已经认识到自己头脑发热，举措失宜。这封信泄露出去的话，他和他的国家所受的打击会比我们还要惨重。”","“No, sir, we have strong reason to believe that he already understands that he has acted in an indiscreet and hot-headed manner. It would be a greater blow to him and to his country than to us if this letter were to come out.”"
"“既然如此，究竟有谁能从泄密事件当中得到好处呢？为什么会有人想偷这封信，想把它公之于众呢？”","“If this is so, whose interest is it that the letter should come out? Why should anyone desire to steal it or to publish it?”"
"“这个问题嘛，福尔摩斯先生，自然牵涉到国际交往之中的高层政治。不过，您只需要看一看目前的欧洲局势，偷信的动机就可以说是一目了然。整个欧洲已经变成了一座武装营垒，眼下又分成了两个势均力敌的军事联盟，大英帝国则扮演着居间平衡的角色。一旦英国被迫跟其中一个联盟开战，另一个联盟不论参战与否，都可以取得欧洲大陆的霸权。您听明白了吗？”","“There, Mr. Holmes, you take me into regions of high international politics. But if you consider the European situation you will have no difficulty in perceiving the motive. The whole of Europe is an armed camp. There is a double league which makes a fair balance of military power. Great Britain holds the scales. If Britain were driven into war with one confederacy, it would assure the supremacy of the other confederacy, whether they joined in the war or not. Do you follow?”"
"“非常明白。如此说来，想要窃取并公开这封信的就是这位君主的敌人，目的是挑起这位君主的国家和我国之间的争端，对吧？”","“Very clearly. It is then the interest of the enemies of this potentate to secure and publish this letter, so as to make a breach between his country and ours?”"
"“是的，先生。”","“Yes, sir.”"
"“那么，敌人拿到这封信之后，会把它交给谁呢？”","“And to whom would this document be sent if it fell into the hands of an enemy?”"
"“交给欧洲大陆任何一个强国的政府。此时此刻，这封信很有可能已经上了汽船，正在以最快的速度奔向海峡对岸。”","“To any of the great Chancelleries of Europe. It is probably speeding on its way thither at the present instant as fast as steam can take it.”"
"特里劳尼·霍普先生垂下头去，禁不住大声地呻吟起来。首相和蔼地拍了拍他的肩膀。","Mr. Trelawney Hope dropped his head on his chest and groaned aloud. The Premier placed his hand kindly upon his shoulder."
"“这只是你运气不好，亲爱的伙计。没人能说你什么，你已经尽了最大的可能来预防这种事情的发生。好了，福尔摩斯先生，我已经把所有的事情告诉了您。按您看，我们应该采取什么样的对策呢？","“It is your misfortune, my dear fellow. No one can blame you. There is no precaution which you have neglected. Now, Mr. Holmes, you are in full possession of the facts. What course do you recommend?”"
"福尔摩斯悲哀地摇了摇头。","Holmes shook his head mournfully."
"“先生，按您的看法，文件找不回来的结果就是战争，对吗？”","“You think, sir, that unless this document is recovered there will be war?”"
"“按我的看法，十之八九就是战争。”","“I think it is very probable.”"
"“那么，先生，备战吧。”","“Then, sir, prepare for war.”"
"“您这话可太无情了，福尔摩斯先生。”","“That is a hard saying, Mr. Holmes.”"
"“想想以下这些事实吧，先生。文件绝不可能是夜里十一点半之后丢的，因为霍普先生说了，从那个时间开始，到他发现文件丢失为止，他和他妻子一直都在房里。如此说来，文件是在昨晚七点半到十一点半之间失窃的，很可能是七点半过一点的时候，因为偷文件的人显然知道文件在那个公文箱里，按常理说肯定会尽早下手。好了，先生，这么重要的一份文件既然是在那个时间失窃的，眼下会在哪里呢？任何人也不会有任何理由让它在自己手里逗留，肯定会迅速地把它交给那些用得着它的人。不要说截下它，就说查到它的去向，咱们能有多大的希望呢？它已经不在咱们的控制范围之内了。”","“Consider the facts, sir. It is inconceivable that it was taken after eleven-thirty at night, since I understand that Mr. Hope and his wife were both in the room from that hour until the loss was found out. It was taken, then, yesterday evening between seven-thirty and eleven-thirty, probably near the earlier hour, since whoever took it evidently knew that it was there and would naturally secure it as early as possible. Now, sir, if a document of this importance were taken at that hour, where can it be now? No one has any reason to retain it. It has been passed rapidly on to those who need it. What chance have we now to overtake or even to trace it? It is beyond our reach.”"
"首相从长椅上站了起来。","The Prime Minister rose from the settee."
"“您说得很有道理，福尔摩斯先生。现在我也觉得，局面确实是脱离了咱们的控制范围。”","“What you say is perfectly logical, Mr. Holmes. I feel that the matter is indeed out of our hands.”"
"“为了便于分析，咱们不妨这么假设，文件是贴身女仆或者男仆偷的——”","“Let us presume, for argument’s sake, that the document was taken by the maid or by the valet—”"
"“他俩都是忠诚可靠的老仆。”","“They are both old and tried servants.”"
"“我估计您的卧室是在三楼，从外面爬不上去，从屋里的楼梯上去的话，肯定也会被人瞧见。这样看来，偷文件的一定是您屋里的人。接下来，窃贼会把文件交给谁呢？肯定是交给某个国际间谍或者特工，这样的人有那么几个，他们的名字我也算是略有所闻。在这些人当中，称得上是行中翘楚的一共有三个，我的第一步打算是出去转转，看看他们三个在不在自己的老窝里。要是有哪个失了踪，尤其是从昨天晚上开始失踪的话，文件的去向就有点儿眉目了。”","“I understand you to say that your room is on the second floor, that there is no entrance from without, and that from within no one could go up unobserved. It must, then, be somebody in the house who has taken it. To whom would the thief take it? To one of several international spies and secret agents, whose names are tolerably familiar to me. There are three who may be said to be the heads of their profession. I will begin my research by going round and finding if each of them is at his post. If one is missing—especially if he has disappeared since last night—we will have some indication as to where the document has gone.”"
"“他干吗要失踪呢？”欧洲事务大臣问道，“他可以把信拿到伦敦的某个使馆去，这也是可能的吧。”","“Why should he be missing?” asked the European Secretary. “He would take the letter to an Embassy in London, as likely as not.”"
"“我看这不可能。这些间谍独立开展工作，跟使馆之间的关系通常都是很僵的。”","“I fancy not. These agents work independently, and their relations with the Embassies are often strained.”"
"首相点头表示赞同。","The Prime Minister nodded his acquiescence."
"“我认为您说得对，福尔摩斯先生。拿到了如此宝贵的一份战利品，他肯定会亲手交回总部。按我看，您选择的路子完全正确。对了，霍普，咱们还有其他的职责，可不能光顾着应付这场灾难。今天如果有什么新情况的话，我们会跟您联系，您的调查要是有了什么进展，也请您务必通知我们。”","“I believe you are right, Mr. Holmes. He would take so valuable a prize to head-quarters with his own hands. I think that your course of action is an excellent one. Meanwhile, Hope, we cannot neglect all our other duties on account of this one misfortune. Should there be any fresh developments during the day we shall communicate with you, and you will no doubt let us know the results of your own inquiries.”"
"两位政治家冲我俩欠身道别，神色严峻地走出了房间。","The two statesmen bowed and walked gravely from the room."
"两位贵客走了之后，福尔摩斯默不作声地点起烟斗，坐在那里沉思了一阵。我打开当天的晨报，正在津津有味地阅读昨夜发生在伦敦的一起耸人听闻的罪案，我朋友突然高叫一声，跳将起来，把烟斗搁在了壁炉台上。","When our illustrious visitors had departed Holmes lit his pipe in silence, and sat for some time lost in the deepest thought. I had opened the morning paper and was immersed in a sensational crime which had occurred in London the night before, when my friend gave an exclamation, sprang to his feet, and laid his pipe down upon the mantelpiece."
"“就这么着吧，”他说道，“更好的办法也没有了。形势固然十分危急，但还不能说是全无指望。即便到了现在，只要咱们能查出是哪个间谍拿到了文件，仍然有可能发现文件尚未转手。说来说去，这些家伙的事情都可以用钱来解决，我的靠山可是英国的国库呢。如果文件流到了市面上，那我就把它买下来，就算以后每一镑的收入要多交一便士的所得税也无所谓。那家伙有可能会把文件扣在手里，先看看这边能出多高的价钱，然后再到那边去碰运气。只有我刚才说的那三个家伙有胆子做这么大的买卖，一个是奥伯施泰因，一个是拉赫梯尔，还有一个是爱德华多·卢卡斯。我得挨个儿去见见他们。”","“Yes,” said he, “there is no better way of approaching it. The situation is desperate, but not hopeless. Even now, if we could be sure which of them has taken it, it is just possible that it has not yet passed out of his hands. After all, it is a question of money with these fellows, and I have the British Treasury behind me. If it’s on the market I’ll buy it—if it means another penny on the income-tax. It is conceivable that the fellow might hold it back to see what bids come from this side before he tries his luck on the other. There are only those three capable of playing so bold a game—there are Oberstein, La Rothiere, and Eduardo Lucas. I will see each of them.”"
"我赶紧瞥了一眼手里的晨报。","I glanced at my morning paper."
"“你说的是高道芬街的那个爱德华多·卢卡斯吗？”","“Is that Eduardo Lucas of Godolphin Street?”"
"“是啊。”","“Yes.”"
"“你见不着他了。”","“You will not see him.”"
"“为什么见不着？”","“Why not?”"
"“昨天夜里，他在自个儿的家里遭到了谋杀。”","“He was murdered in his house last night.”"
"在我俩的冒险生涯当中，我朋友很让我受了一些惊吓，眼下我看到他被我结结实实地吓了一跳，心里不免颇为自得。他目瞪口呆地站了片刻，然后就一把抓去了我手里的报纸。他从椅子上跳起来的时候，我正在读的就是以下这篇报道：","My friend has so often astonished me in the course of our adventures that it was with a sense of exultation that I realized how completely I had astonished him. He stared in amazement, and then snatched the paper from my hands. This was the paragraph which I had been engaged in reading when he rose from his chair:"
"> 西敏寺凶案","> MUrder in Westminster"
"> 昨日夜间，高道芬街十六号发生离奇罪案。此街道地处泰晤士河与西敏寺之间，毗邻议会大厦，几与大厦塔楼阴影相接[^6]。街道两侧皆为古朴幽僻之十八世纪房屋，十六号亦复如此。爱德华多·卢卡斯先生于此小巧精舍寓居有年，其人风度翩翩，国中顶尖业余男高音之誉亦非虚传，以此向为社交圈中著名人物。卢卡斯先生现年三十四岁，尚未婚娶，家中但有老管家普林格尔太太及贴身男仆米顿。管家向来早早安寝，卧室位于寓所顶楼，男仆昨晚亦已前往汉默史密斯街区访友，以故十时之后，卢卡斯先生即是独处房中。此后之事迄未查明，唯警员巴雷特于十一时三刻路经高道芬街，因见十六号屋门半掩，遂往叩门问讯。屋中未有应答，前厅复有灯光，警员遂走入过道，再度叩门。此时亦无应答，警员乃推门入室，则见满室狼藉，家具悉数移位，集于房间一侧，房间中央更有仰天翻倒之椅子一把。不幸屋主横尸椅边，一手依然坚执椅腿。渠既心脏中刀，想系立时丧命。室中一壁饰有多种东方武器，凶器即自壁间摘来，为印度所产之弧形短刀一柄。贵重物品皆无移动迹象，凶案动机似非劫财。爱德华多·卢卡斯先生声名如此煊赫，又得众人如许喜爱，此次离奇惨祸必将引发各界友人之痛切关注及深挚同情。","> A crime of mysterious character was committed last night at 16, Godolphin Street, one of the old-fashioned and secluded rows of eighteenth-century houses which lie between the river and the Abbey, almost in the shadow of the great Tower of the Houses of Parliament. This small but select mansion has been inhabited for some years by Mr. Eduardo Lucas, well known in society circles both on account of his charming personality and because he has the well-deserved reputation of being one of the best amateur tenors in the country. Mr. Lucas is an unmarried man, thirty-four years of age, and his establishment consists of Mrs. Pringle, an elderly housekeeper, and of Mitton, his valet. The former retires early and sleeps at the top of the house. The valet was out for the evening, visiting a friend at Hammersmith. From ten o’clock onwards Mr. Lucas had the house to himself. What occurred during that time has not yet transpired, but at a quarter to twelve Police-constable Barrett, passing along Godolphin Street, observed that the door of No.16 was ajar. He knocked, but received no answer. Perceiving a light in the front room he advanced into the passage and again knocked, but without reply. He then pushed open the door and entered. The room was in a state of wild disorder, the furniture being all swept to one side, and one chair lying on its back in the centre. Beside this chair, and still grasping one of its legs, lay the unfortunate tenant of the house. He had been stabbed to the heart and must have died instantly. The knife with which the crime had been committed was a curved Indian dagger, plucked down from a trophy of Oriental arms which adorned one of the walls. Robbery does not appear to have been the motive of the crime, for there had been no attempt to remove the valuable contents of the room. Mr. Eduardo Lucas was so well known and popular that his violent and mysterious fate will arouse painful interest and intense sympathy in a wide-spread circle of friends."
"“呃，华生，这事情你怎么看呢？”沉默良久之后，福尔摩斯问道。","“Well, Watson, what do you make of this?” asked Holmes, after a long pause."
"“这是个惊人的巧合。”","“It is an amazing coincidence.”"
"“巧合！咱们刚刚列出了最有可能出演这部戏的三名演员，他也是其中之一，然后呢，他突然横死家中，时间又刚好跟这部戏的上演时间对得上。这种巧合发生的几率实在是太小，小得没法用数字表达出来。不对，亲爱的华生，这两件事情有关联，必定有关联。到底是什么关联，就得靠咱们去查了。”","“A coincidence! Here is one of the three men whom we had named as possible actors in this drama, and he meets a violent death during the very hours when we know that that drama was being enacted. The odds are enormous against its being coincidence. No figures could express them. No, my dear Watson, the two events are connected—*must* be connected. It is for us to find the connection.”"
"“既然这样，警方肯定是什么都知道了啊。”","“But now the official police must know all.”"
"“没那回事。高道芬街那些摆在眼前的事情，他们可以说是什么都知道，白厅巷的事情呢，他们只能说是什么都不知道，将来也不会知道。只有咱们同时知道这两件事情，能够去追查两者之间的关联。不管怎么说，卢卡斯身上本来就有一个明显的疑点，因为高道芬街在西敏寺附近，走路到白厅巷只需要几分钟的时间。而我说的另外两个间谍都住在西区的最西边[^7]。由此可知，要想跟欧洲事务大臣屋里的人搭上关系，或者是收取从他屋里来的情报，卢卡斯的条件最为便利。这只是一个小小的细节，可是，如果你考虑到一连串的变故都发生在短短几个钟头之内，这一点兴许就十分重要了。嘿！来的是谁呢？”","“Not at all. They know all they see at Godolphin Street. They know—and shall know—nothing of Whitehall Terrace. Only *we*know of both events, and can trace the relation between them. There is one obvious point which would, in any case, have turned my suspicions against Lucas. Godolphin Street, Westminster, is only a few minutes’ walk from Whitehall Terrace. The other secret agents whom I have named live in the extreme West End. It was easier, therefore, for Lucas than for the others to establish a connection or receive a message from the European Secretary’s household—a small thing, and yet where events are compressed into a few hours it may prove essential. Halloa! what have we here?”"
"哈德森太太端着托盘走了进来，托盘里摆的是一位女士的名片。福尔摩斯瞥了一眼名片，眉毛一挑，随手把名片递给了我。","Mrs. Hudson had appeared with a lady’s card upon her salver. Holmes glanced at it, raised his eyebrows, and handed it over to me."
"“请希尔达·特里劳尼·霍普夫人移驾上楼吧。”他说道。","“Ask Lady Hilda Trelawney Hope if she will be kind enough to step up,” said he."
"片刻之后，伦敦最惹人怜爱的女士踏进门来，我们的寒舍今晨已然蓬荜生辉，眼下就更是光华满室。我经常听人说，贝米尼斯特公爵的小女儿美若天仙，可是，传闻听得再多，没有色彩的相片看得再熟，我终归无法预料，她那张精缕细刻的脸庞居然能拥有如此妙不可言的魅力，如此美丽动人的色彩。尽管如此，秋天里的这个上午，她的脸留给我们的第一印象并不是美丽。她的双颊秀美迷人，激动的情绪却让它苍白黯淡；她的双眼熠熠生辉，光亮却来自如焚的忧心；她的嘴唇敏感多情，此刻却紧紧地绷了起来，因为她正在强作镇定。天生丽质的客人停留在门框之中的那个瞬间，率先跃入我们眼帘的事物并不是美，而是恐惧。","A moment later our modest apartment, already so distinguished that morning, was further honoured by the entrance of the most lovely woman in London. I had often heard of the beauty of the youngest daughter of the Duke of Belminster, but no description of it, and no contemplation of colourless photographs, had prepared me for the subtle, delicate charm and the beautiful colouring of that exquisite head. And yet as we saw it that autumn morning, it was not its beauty which would be the first thing to impress the observer. The cheek was lovely, but it was paled with emotion; the eyes were bright, but it was the brightness of fever; the sensitive mouth was tight and drawn in an effort after self-command. Terror—not beauty—was what sprang first to the eye as our fair visitor stood framed for an instant in the open door."
"“我丈夫来过这儿吗，福尔摩斯先生？”","“Has my husband been here, Mr. Holmes?”"
"“是的，夫人，他来过这儿。”","“Yes, madam, he has been here.”"
"“福尔摩斯先生，我恳求您，千万别把我来这儿的事情告诉他。”福尔摩斯冷冷地欠了欠身，指了指一把椅子，示意她坐下。","“Mr. Holmes, I implore you not to tell him that I came here.” Holmes bowed coldly, and motioned the lady to a chair."
"“夫人您实在让我非常为难。麻烦您坐下，跟我说说您到底有什么要求，不过，恐怕我给不了什么无条件的承诺。”","“Your ladyship places me in a very delicate position. I beg that you will sit down and tell me what you desire; but I fear that I cannot make any unconditional promise.”"
"她然穿过房间，背对着窗子坐了下来。她可真是个女王一般的人物，个儿高挑，身姿优雅，千娇百媚。","She swept across the room and seated herself with her back to the window. It was a queenly presence—tall, graceful, and intensely womanly."
"“福尔摩斯先生，”她说道，戴着白色手套的双手一会儿扣在一起，一会儿又各自分开，“我会跟您实话实说，希望能换来您的坦诚。我丈夫跟我无话不谈，只有一件事情例外，那就是政治。在这个问题上，他总是守口如瓶，什么也不跟我说。好了，我已经知道，昨天晚上，我家里发生了一件十分不幸的事情。我还知道，有一份文件不见了。可是，因为事情牵涉到政治，我丈夫不肯把全部的实情告诉我。眼下呢，我必须彻底弄清这件事情的意义，这一点至关重要，相信我，真的是至关重要。除了那些搞政治的之外，只有您知道事情的真相。所以我恳求您，福尔摩斯先生，您一定得告诉我，到底发生了什么事情，后果又会是什么。把全部的真相告诉我吧，福尔摩斯先生。您的沉默无非是为了主顾的利益，这一层您用不着担心，因为我可以跟您保证，对他来说，最有利的选择就是完完全全地信任我，只可惜他不明白这一点。失窃的文件到底是什么内容呢？”","“Mr. Holmes,” she said—and her white-gloved hands clasped and unclasped as she spoke—“I will speak frankly to you in the hope that it may induce you to speak frankly in return. There is complete confidence between my husband and me on all matters save one. That one is politics. On this his lips are sealed. He tells me nothing. Now, I am aware that there was a most deplorable occurrence in our house last night. I know that a paper has disappeared. But because the matter is political my husband refuses to take me into his complete confidence. Now it is essential—essential, I say—that I should thoroughly understand it. You are the only other person, save only these politicians, who knows the true facts. I beg you, then, Mr. Holmes, to tell me exactly what has happened and what it will lead to. Tell me all, Mr. Holmes. Let no regard for your client’s interests keep you silent, for I assure you that his interests, if he would only see it, would be best served by taking me into his complete confidence. What was this paper which was stolen?”"
"“夫人，您这个问题我真的不能回答。”","“Madam, what you ask me is really impossible.”"
"她发出一声呻吟，双手捂住了脸。","She groaned and sank her face in her hands."
"“您一定得明白，夫人，我确实不能回答您的问题。作出了保守秘密的职业承诺之后，我才能够获悉事情的真相，您想想看，连您的丈夫都认为不应该让您知道，我又怎么能透露他竭力保守的秘密呢？您不应该提出这样的问题，要问也只能去问您的丈夫。”","“You must see that this is so, madam. If your husband thinks fit to keep you in the dark over this matter, is it for me, who has only learned the true facts under the pledge of professional secrecy, to tell what he has withheld? It is not fair to ask it. It is him whom you must ask.”"
"“我问过他了啊，实在没办法才来找您的。不过，福尔摩斯先生，用不着透露任何明确的细节，您也可以帮我一个大忙，只需要回答我一个问题就行了。”","“I have asked him. I come to you as a last resource. But without your telling me anything definite, Mr. Holmes, you may do a great service if you would enlighten me on one point.”"
"“什么问题呢，夫人？”","“What is it, madam?”"
"“这次的事情会影响我丈夫的政治前途吗？”","“Is my husband’s political career likely to suffer through this incident?”"
"“呃，夫人，事情如果不能挽回的话，肯定会产生非常严重的后果。”","“Well, madam, unless it is set right it may certainly have a very unfortunate effect.”"
"“啊！”她猛吸一口气，似乎是解开了心里的谜团。","“Ah!” She drew in her breath sharply as one whose doubts are resolved."
"“还有一个问题，福尔摩斯先生。我丈夫刚刚意识到这场灾难的时候，我注意到了他脸上的表情，所以我知道，文件丢失的事情可能会对公众的利益造成一些可怕的影响。”","“One more question, Mr. Holmes. From an expression which my husband dropped in the first shock of this disaster I understood that terrible public consequences might arise from the loss of this document.”"
"“他如果这么说的话，我自然无法否认。”","“If he said so, I certainly cannot deny it.”"
"“这些影响是什么性质呢？”","“Of what nature are they?”"
"“无可奉告，夫人，您又提出了一个我无法回答的问题。”","“Nay, madam, there again you ask me more than I can possibly answer.”"
"“那我就不打扰您了。您虽然不肯把话说得明白一点儿，福尔摩斯先生，可我并没有抱怨的理由，还有啊，我急着分担丈夫的烦恼，甚至不惜违背他本人的意愿，相信您也不会见怪，觉得我心存歹念。我再次恳求您，别把我上门拜访的事情说出去。”","“Then I will take up no more of your time. I cannot blame you, Mr. Holmes, for having refused to speak more freely, and you on your side will not, I am sure, think the worse of me because I desire, even against his will, to share my husband’s anxieties. Once more I beg that you will say nothing of my visit.”"
"走到门口的时候，她回头看了看我俩，我又一次瞥见了那张美丽却憔悴的脸庞，那双惊恐的眼睛，还有那两片紧绷的嘴唇。转眼之间，她走出了我俩的视线。","She looked back at us from the door, and I had a last impression of that beautiful haunted face, the startled eyes, and the drawn mouth. Then she was gone."
"衣裙的窸窣声音渐渐消逝，随之而来的是前门砰然关闭的声音。福尔摩斯微笑着说道，“好了，华生，研究女性可是你的专长啊。这位美丽的女士在玩什么把戏呢？她真正的意图是什么呢？”","“Now, Watson, the fair sex is your department,” said Holmes, with a smile, when the dwindling frou-frou of skirts had ended in the slam of the front door. “What was the fair lady’s game? What did she really want?”"
"“她自个儿不是说得很清楚嘛，她的焦虑也很正常啊。”","“Surely her own statement is clear and her anxiety very natural.”"
"“哼！好好想想她的模样吧，华生，她的神态，她强自压抑的激动情绪，她坐立不安的举止，还有她再三追问的执拗劲头。注意啊，她可是来自一个不轻易流露感情的阶层。”","“Hum! Think of her appearance, Watson—her manner, her suppressed excitement, her restlessness, her tenacity in asking questions. Remember that she comes of a caste who do not lightly show emotion.”"
"“她确实是非常激动。”","“She was certainly much moved.”"
"“同样值得注意的是，刚才她跟咱们保证，对她丈夫最有利的做法就是让她了解全部的事情，说这话的时候，她的神情认真得出奇。她这么说，到底是什么意思呢？还有啊，华生，你肯定也留意到了，她刻意坐在了背光的地方，显然是不想让咱们看清她的表情。”","“Remember also the curious earnestness with which she assured us that it was best for her husband that she should know all. What did she mean by that? And you must have observed, Watson, how she manœuvred to have the light at her back. She did not wish us to read her expression.”"
"“没错，房间里只有那一把椅子是背光的，刚好就让她给挑上了。”","“Yes; she chose the one chair in the room.”"
"“话说回来，女人的心思确实莫名其妙。你还记得马盖特镇的那个女人吧，我对她的怀疑也是因为同样的事情，结果呢，正确的解释不过是她鼻子上没有扑粉。这一类的证据跟流沙一样靠不住，怎么能用作演绎的基础呢？她们最平凡琐碎的举动可能包含着最为重大的意义，最超常出格的行为倒可能只是因为一支发夹或者一把卷发钳。回头见，华生。”","“And yet the motives of women are so inscrutable. You remember the woman at Margate whom I suspected for the same reason. No powder on her nose—that proved to be the correct solution. How can you build on such a quicksand? Their most trivial action may mean volumes, or their most extraordinary conduct may depend upon a hairpin or a curling-tongs. Good morning, Watson.”"
"“你要出门吗？”","“You are off?”"
"“是啊，我打算去一趟高道芬街，跟咱们的正规军朋友一起消磨这个上午。咱们这个问题的答案肯定是在爱德华多·卢卡斯的身上，当然我不得不承认，眼下我一点儿也不知道，答案会是什么模样。不等掌握事实就提前作出判断，这样的做法最要不得。麻烦你在这儿留守，好心肠的华生老弟，有客人就帮我接待一下。我尽量赶回来跟你一起吃午饭。”","“Yes; I will while away the morning at Godolphin Street with our friends of the regular establishment. With Eduardo Lucas lies the solution of our problem, though I must admit that I have not an inkling as to what form it may take. It is a capital mistake to theorize in advance of the facts. Do you stay on guard, my good Watson, and receive any fresh visitors. I’ll join you at lunch if I am able.”"
"这一天过完，接下来又是一天，再下来还是一天，福尔摩斯一直处于同一种状态，朋友们管这种状态叫做沉默寡言，其他人的说法则是乖张阴郁。他时而跑进跑出，时而一支接一支地抽烟，时而用他的小提琴拉一些支离破碎的曲调，时而冥思苦想，还在各种稀奇古怪的时间大嚼三明治，几乎不回答我偶或提出的任何问题。我心里非常明白，他眼下情形不妙，他的调查工作也是一样。他闭口不谈案子的事情，我通过报纸才了解到死因调查的细节，了解到死者的贴身男仆约翰·米顿先是被捕继而获释的经过。死因调查陪审团得出了蓄意谋杀的显然结论，凶手的身份则依然毫无头绪，作案的动机也无从寻觅。发生凶案的房间里摆满了贵重物品，全部都是原封未动，死者的文件也没有被人翻动的迹象。警方仔细检查了那些文件，由此发现死者是一位痴迷于国际政治的观察家，也是一个不知疲倦的闲话篓子，又是一名卓越不凡的语言专家，还是一个兢兢业业的信件作者，跟好几个国家的政坛显贵都有亲密的交往。不过，他那些文件虽然把一个个抽屉塞得满满当当，里面却没有什么耸人听闻的东西。他的男女关系似乎十分混乱，同时又都是浅尝辄止。他有很多女性熟人，算得上朋友的却没几个，更没有一个为他所爱。他的生活很有规律，举止也不招人讨厌。他的横死完全是一个谜，这个谜多半还会持续下去。","All that day and the next and the next Holmes was in a mood which his friends would call taciturn, and others morose. He ran out and ran in, smoked incessantly, played snatches on his violin, sank into reveries, devoured sandwiches at irregular hours, and hardly answered the casual questions which I put to him. It was evident to me that things were not going well with him or his quest. He would say nothing of the case, and it was from the papers that I learned the particulars of the inquest, and the arrest with the subsequent release of John Mitton, the valet of the deceased. The coroner’s jury brought in the obvious Wilful Murder, but the parties remained as unknown as ever. No motive was suggested. The room was full of articles of value, but none had been taken. The dead man’s papers had not been tampered with. They were carefully examined, and showed that he was a keen student of international politics, an indefatigable gossip, a remarkable linguist, and an untiring letter-writer. He had been on intimate terms with the leading politicians of several countries. But nothing sensational was discovered among the documents which filled his drawers. As to his relations with women, they appeared to have been promiscuous but superficial. He had many acquaintances among them, but few friends, and no one whom he loved. His habits were regular, his conduct inoffensive. His death was an absolute mystery, and likely to remain so."
"说到贴身男仆约翰·米顿被捕的事情，这只是因为警方不愿意显得毫无作为，无奈之下才出此下策。不过，他们找不到任何可以指控他的证据。案发当晚他在汉默史密斯街区访友，拥有无懈可击的不在场证明。诚然，根据他起身回家的时间来推算，他应该可以在警员发现凶案之前赶到西敏寺附近，可他自己的解释是他徒步走了一段，所以耽搁了时间，考虑到当晚天气宜人，他这种解释显得相当可信。事实上，他十二点钟才到家，看到那场飞来惨祸的时候，他表现得极为惊骇。除此之外，他跟主人的关系一向都非常不错。警方在男仆的箱子里找到了死者的一些物品，尤其值得注意的是一小盒剃刀，男仆解释说这是死者以前送他的礼物，管家也证实了他的说法。米顿已经在卢卡斯那里干了三年，奇怪的是，卢卡斯从来不曾带他去欧洲大陆[^8]。有那么几次，卢卡斯在巴黎一口气待了三个月，其间却让米顿留在高道芬街看房子。至于那名管家，案发当晚她什么也没听见。按她的说法，如果有客人到访的话，肯定也是主人自己去开的门。","As to the arrest of John Mitton, the valet, it was a counsel of despair as an alternative to absolute inaction. But no case could be sustained against him. He had visited friends in Hammersmith that night. The *alibi* was complete. It is true that he started home at an hour which should have brought him to Westminster before the time when the crime was discovered, but his own explanation that he had walked part of the way seemed probable enough in view of the fineness of the night. He had actually arrived at twelve o’clock, and appeared to be overwhelmed by the unexpected tragedy. He had always been on good terms with his master. Several of the dead man’s possessions—notably a small case of razors—had been found in the valet’s boxes, but he explained that theyhad been presents from the deceased, and the housekeeper was able to corroborate the story. Mitton had been in Lucas’s employment for three years. It was noticeable that Lucas did not take Mitton on the Continent with him. Sometimes he visited Paris for three months on end, but Mitton was left in charge of the Godolphin Street house. As to the housekeeper, she had heard nothing on the night of the crime. If her master had a visitor he had himself admitted him."
"就这样，根据我从报纸上读到的情况来判断，这桩谜案一直持续了三个上午。要说福尔摩斯掌握的情况比我多的话，那他也没有告诉我。不过，他曾经跟我提起，雷斯垂德督察把案子的详情告诉了他，由此看来，他可以随时掌握案子的动向。案发之后的第四天，《每日电讯报》刊载了一篇来自巴黎的冗长专电，整件案子似乎就此水落石出。报道内容如下：","So for three mornings the mystery remained, so far as I could follow it in the papers. If Holmes knew more he kept his own counsel, but, as he told me that Inspector Lestrade had taken him into his confidence in the case, I knew that he was in close touch with every development. Upon the fourth day there appeared a long telegram from Paris which seemed to solve the whole question."
"> 据巴黎警方最新发现，爱德华多·卢卡斯先生惨死之谜已得破解。其人遇害乃在本周一晚间，地点则为西敏寺左近之高道芬街。读者谅可记得，案发当时，警方发现事主于家中遭人刺杀，并将事主之贴身男仆指为疑凶，男仆随即提交不在场证明，调查无疾而终。巴黎警方昨日接获仆人举报，家住奥斯特利茨街某小别墅之女主业已疯狂。女主号为昂热·方纳依太太，勘验结果表明，此女确已罹患危害甚大之永久疯病。警方并已询知，昂热·方纳依太太周二方自伦敦返回，更有迹象表明，此女与西敏寺罪案不无关涉。相片比对已有确凿结论，昂热·方纳依纳依先生与业已遇害之爱德华多·卢卡斯实为一人，但因某等情由于伦敦巴黎分饰两角而已。方纳依太太为克里奥耳[^9]族裔，性情极之暴烈，此前即多次由悍妒而入疯狂。据警方推测，方纳依太太此次亦因嫉妒成狂，故而制造此等可怖罪案，致令伦敦全城哗然。此女周一晚间之行踪迄未查明，所可确证者，则周二晨间曾有一女现身查令十字车站，不唯相貌与此女相符，更兼仪容狂野、举止暴悍，颇令旁人侧目。以理推之，此不幸女子之疯狂情状可为罪行因由，亦可为罪行引发之直接后果。此女目下无法就先前经历提供任何清晰陈述，据医生所言，恢复此女神智实属渺茫之事。另有目击证人声称，周一晚间曾有一女于高道芬街窥视死者房舍达数小时之久，或即方纳依太太亦未可知。","> A discovery has just been made by the Parisian police [said the *Daily Telegraph*] which raises the veil which hung round the tragic fate of Mr. Eduardo Lucas, who met his death by violence last Monday night at Godolphin Street, Westminster. Our readers will remember that the deceased gentleman was found stabbed in his room, and that some suspicion attached to his valet, but that the case broke down on an *alibi*. Yesterday a lady, who has been known as Mme. Henri Fournaye, occupying a small villa in the Rue Austerlitz, was reported to the authorities by her servants as being insane. An examination showed that she had indeed developed mania of a dangerous and permanent form. On inquiry the police have discovered that Mme. Henri Fournaye only returned from a journey to London on Tuesday last, and there is evidence to connect her with the crime at Westminster. A comparison of photographs has proved conclusively that M. Henri Fournaye and Eduardo Lucas were really one and the same person, and that the deceased had for some reason lived a double life in London and Paris. Mme. Fournaye, who is of Creole origin, is of an extremely excitable nature, and has suffered in the past from attacks of jealousy which have amounted to frenzy. It is conjectured that it was in one of these that she committed the terrible crime which has caused such a sensation in London. Her movements upon the Monday night have not yet been traced, but it is undoubted that a woman answering to her description attracted much attention at Charing Cross Station on Tuesday morning by the wildness of her appearance and the violence of her gestures. It is probable, therefore, that the crime was either committed when insane, or that its immediate effect was to drive the unhappy woman out of her mind. At present she is unable to give any coherent account of the past, and the doctors hold out no hopes of the re-establishment of her reason. There is evidence that a woman, who might have been Mme. Fournaye, was seen for some hours on Monday night watching the house in Godolphin Street."
"“这事情你怎么看呢，福尔摩斯？”这时候，我已经把报道念给福尔摩斯听了一遍，而他也刚好吃完了早饭。","“What do you think of that, Holmes?” I had read the account aloud to him, while he finished his breakfast."
"“亲爱的华生啊，”他一边说，一边站起身来，开始在房间里来回踱步，“你可真沉得住气。不过，前面这三天我什么都没跟你说，实在也是因为没东西可说。即便到了现在，来自巴黎的这篇报道依然帮不上咱们的忙。”","“My dear Watson,” said he, as he rose from the table and paced up and down the room, “you are most long-suffering, but if I have told you nothing in the last three days it is because there is nothing to tell. Even now this report from Paris does not help us much.”"
"“再怎么说，它也让这个人的死因有了定论啊。”","“Surely it is final as regards the man’s death.”"
"“跟咱们的真正使命相比，这个人的死只不过是一次事故，一段微不足道的插曲，咱们要做的事情是找到文件，阻止一场戕害全欧的弥天大祸。前面这三天只发生了一件重要的事情，这件事情就是，什么事情也没有发生。我几乎每个钟头都会收到政府的通报，可以肯定的是，欧洲的任何地方都还没有出现大事不妙的征兆。好了，假设这封信已经流了出去的话——不，它不可能已经流了出去——可是，没流出去的话，它会在什么地方呢？拿着它的是谁？为什么按兵不动？这些问题就像钉锤一样，敲得我脑袋嗡嗡直响。难道说，卢卡斯死在了信件失踪的那个晚上，真的只是一种巧合吗？信到他手里了吗？到了的话，他的文件里为什么没有呢？难不成，是他那个疯疯癫癫的妻子把信拿跑了吗？果真如此的话，信会在巴黎他妻子的家里吗？我怎样才能搜查他妻子的家，同时又不惹起法国警方的疑心呢？亲爱的华生啊，就这件案子而言，执法人员对咱们的威胁跟罪犯一样大。所有的人都在跟咱们作对，事情又实在是极其重大。要是我能够圆满结案的话，这件案子无疑会成为我侦探生涯当中的至高荣耀。哈，火线上的最新消息来了！”他匆匆地扫了一眼仆人刚刚送来的便条。“嘿！雷斯垂德似乎有了一点儿有趣的发现。戴上帽子，华生，咱们一起去西敏寺那边蹓跶蹓跶吧。”","“The man’s death is a mere incident—a trivial episode—in comparison with our real task, which is to trace this document and save a European catastrophe. Only one important thing has happened in the last three days, and that is that nothing has happened. I get reports almost hourly from the Government, and it is certain that nowhere in Europe is there any sign of trouble. Now, if this letter were loose—no, it *can’t* be loose—but if it isn’t loose, where can it be? Who has it? Why is it held back? That’s the question that beats in my brain like a hammer. Was it, indeed, a coincidence that Lucas should meet his death on the night when the letter disappeared? Did the letter ever reach him? If so, why is it not among his papers? Did this mad wife of his carry it off with her? If so, is it in her house in Paris? How could I search for it without the French police having their suspicions aroused? It is a case, my dear Watson, where the law is as dangerous to us as the criminals are. Every man’s hand is against us, and yet the interests at stake are colossal. Should I bring it to a successful conclusion it will certainly represent the crowning glory of my career. Ah, here is my latest from the front!” He glanced hurriedly at the note which had been handed in. “Halloa! Lestrade seems to have observed something of interest. Put on your hat, Watson, and we will stroll down together to Westminster.”"
"这是我第一次来到这件案子的事发现场，眼前是一座又高又窄、沾满煤烟的房子，看起来跟房子落成的那个世纪一样刻板庄重、分量十足。雷斯垂德那张牛头犬一般的面孔出现在了房子的前窗里面，正在注视我俩。接下来，一名大块头警员打开房门，把我俩让了进去，雷斯垂德非常热情地跟我俩打了个招呼。我俩走进的房间正是凶案现场，凶案的痕迹却已经消失殆尽，只有地毯上还残留着一块不规则的血迹，看起来十分碍眼。这是一块小小的粗毛方毯，铺在宽敞的房间中央，周围是漂亮的老式地板，由一块块十分光洁的方形木板拼砌而成。壁炉台上方陈列着一份精美的武器收藏，其中一件藏品还曾经在那个悲惨的夜晚派上了用场。窗子跟前摆着一张华丽的写字台，房间里陈设着各式各样的油画、毛皮小毯子和帘帷，每一个细节都体现着一种奢靡得近于阴柔的品味。","It was my first visit to the scene of the crime—a high, dingy, narrow-chested house, prim, formal, and solid, like the century which gave it birth. Lestrade’s bulldog features gazed out at us from the front window, and he greeted us warmly when a big constable had opened the door and let us in. The room into which we were shown was that in which the crime had been committed, but no trace of it now remained, save an ugly, irregular stain upon the carpet. This carpet was a small square drugget in the centre of the room, surrounded by a broad expanse of beautiful, old-fashioned wood-flooring in square blocks highly polished. Over the fireplace was a magnificent trophy of weapons, one of which had been used on that tragic night. In the window was a sumptuous writing-desk, and every detail of the apartment, the pictures, the rugs, and the hangings, all pointed to a taste which was luxurious to the verge of effeminacy."
"“看到巴黎来的消息了吗？”雷斯垂德问道。","“Seen the Paris news?” asked Lestrade."
"福尔摩斯点了点头。","Holmes nodded."
"“这一回，咱们的法国朋友似乎搔到了痒处。毫无疑问，事情就跟他们说的一样。他妻子敲响了他的房门，要我说，他肯定觉得非常意外，因为他一直都把自己在这边的生活捂得密不透风。他不能让她在大街上站着，于是就让她进了门。她告诉他，她是怎么查到了他的踪迹，跟着就开始数落他，越数落越来气，然后呢，短刀既然近在手边，结局自然不会太远。不过，结局肯定不是瞬间来到的，因为这些椅子当时都被掀到了那边，死者手里也抓着一把椅子，似乎是想要用它来抵挡她的攻击。我们已经把当时的情形弄得一清二楚，就跟亲眼看见没什么两样。”","“Our French friends seem to have touched the spot this time. No doubt it’s just as they say. She knocked at the door—surprise visit, I guess, for he kept his life in water-tight compartments. He let her in—couldn’t keep her in the street. She told him how she had traced him, reproached him, one thing led to another, and then with that dagger so handy the end soon came. It wasn’t all done in an instant, though, for these chairs were all swept over yonder, and he had one in his hand as if he had tried to hold her off with it. We’ve got it all clear as if we had seen it.”"
"福尔摩斯挑起了眉毛。","Holmes raised his eyebrows."
"“那你还叫我来干什么呢？”","“And yet you have sent for me?”"
"“哦，这样的，我找你是因为另外一件事情，仅仅是一件小之又小的事情，只不过刚好属于你感兴趣的那一类。这件事情很古怪，你知道吧，说是反常也可以。它跟主要的案情没有任何关系——不可能有关系，表面上反正看不出来。”","“Ah, yes, that’s another matter—a mere trifle, but the sort of thing you take an interest in—queer, you know, and what you might call freakish. It has nothing to do with the main fact— can’t have, on the face of it.”"
"“究竟是什么事情？”","“What is it, then?”"
"“是这样，你知道吧，赶上这种罪案的时候，我们总是非常注意保护现场。房间里的东西都没有动过，还有警员在这里昼夜看守。今天早上，死者已经下葬，调查也结束了，呃，这个房间里的调查反正是结束了，所以呢，我们决定把房间收拾一下。这块地毯，你瞧，地毯只是摊在地板上，并没有固定。中间有那么一次，我们需要把地毯掀起来，我们发现——”","“Well, you know, after a crime of this sort we are very careful to keep things in their position. Nothing has been moved. Officer in charge hereday and night. This morning, as the man was buried and the investigation over—so far as this room is concerned—we thought we could tidy up a bit. This carpet. You see, it is not fastened down; only just laid there. We had occasion to raise it. We found—”"
"“什么呢？你们发现——”","“Yes? You found—”"
"福尔摩斯露出了紧张的神色，显然是迫不及待。","Holmes’s face grew tense with anxiety."
"“呃，我们发现了什么，我保证你猜一百年也猜不出来。地毯上的那块血迹，你瞧见了吗？看情形，一定有很多血渗到了地毯下面，对吧？”","“Well, I’m sure you would never guess in a hundred years what we did find. You see that stain on the carpet? Well, a great deal must have soaked through, must it not?”"
"“毫无疑问。”","“Undoubtedly it must.”"
"“很好，接下来你就该觉得意外了，因为我要说的是，白色的木地板上并没有跟它对应的血迹。”","“Well, you will be surprised to hear that there is no stain on the white woodwork to correspond.”"
"“没有血迹！可那儿肯定得——”","“No stain! But there must—”"
"“是得有，你完全可以这么说。可是，事实明摆着，没有就是没有。”","“Yes; so you would say. But the fact remains that there isn’t.”"
"他抓住地毯的一角，把那个角翻了过来，以此证明自己所言不虚。","He took the corner of the carpet in his hand and, turning it over, he showed that it was indeed as he said."
"“可是，地毯背面的血迹跟正面一样深啊，肯定会在地板上留下印迹的。”","“But the underside is as stained as the upper. It must have left a mark.”"
"眼看这位名闻遐迩的专家被自己弄得一头雾水，雷斯垂德喜不自禁，格格地笑了起来。","Lestrade chuckled with delight at having puzzled the famous expert."
"“好啦，我这就给你揭晓答案。第二块血迹确实存在，只不过不在跟第一块相对应的位置。自个儿看看吧。”他一边说，一边把地毯的另一角掀了起来，果不其然，老式地板的一个白色方格里印着一大块深红的血迹。“你觉得这是怎么回事呢，福尔摩斯先生？”","“Now I’ll show you the explanation. There *is*a second stain, but it does not correspond with the other. See for yourself.” As he spoke he turned over another portion of the carpet, and there, sure enough, was a great crimson spill upon the square white facing of the old-fashioned floor. “What do you make of that, Mr. Holmes?”"
"“咳，这还不简单嘛。两块血迹本来是对应的，只不过地毯被人转了一下而已。地毯是方形的，又没有固定在地板上，转起来非常容易。”","“Why, it is simple enough. The two stains did correspond, but the carpet has been turned round. As it was square and unfastened it was easily done.”"
"“地毯被人转了一下，福尔摩斯先生，警方并不需要从你这里知道。这一点非常明显，因为两块血迹完全重合——如果你把它们重起来的话。我想知道的是，转动地毯的人是谁，为的又是什么？”","“The official police don’t need you, Mr. Holmes, to tell them that the carpet must have been turned round. That’s clear enough, for the stains lie above each other—if you lay it over this way. But what I want to know is, who shifted the carpet, and why?”"
"福尔摩斯的脸绷得紧紧的，显然是兴奋到了心里发颤的地步。","I could see from Holmes’s rigid face that he was vibrating with inward excitement."
"“听我说，雷斯垂德，”他说道，“看守房子的一直都是过道里的那名警员吗？”","“Look here, Lestrade,” said he, “has that constable in the passage been in charge of the place all the time?”"
"“是的，一直都是他。”","“Yes, he has.”"
"“这样的话，你不妨听听我的建议，好好地盘问他一下。别当着我俩的面，我俩在这儿等你，你带他去里屋好了。私下盘问的话，更容易问出实话。你得这么问他，他怎么这么大胆，不但放外人进来，还让外人自个儿在屋里待着。别问他有没有这么干，只当他确实是干了。你得告诉他，你知道有人进过这个房间。你要逼问他，还要让他明白，只有彻底坦白才有可能得到宽恕。去吧，严格按我说的去办！”","“Well, take my advice. Examine him carefully. Don’t do it before us. We’ll wait here. You take him into the back room. You’ll be more likely to get a confession out of him alone. Ask him how he dared to admit people and leave them alone in this room. Don’t ask him if he has done it. Take it for granted. Tell him you *know* someone has been here. Press him. Tell him that a full confession is his only chance of forgiveness. Do exactly what I tell you!”"
"“老天作证，只要他知道，我就一定能让他说出来！”雷斯垂德高喊一声，一头冲进了过道。片刻之后，里屋就传来了他盛气凌人的声音。","“By George, if he knows I’ll have it out of him!” cried Lestrade. He darted into the hall, and a few moments later his bullying voice sounded from the back room."
"“快，华生，快！”福尔摩斯高声喊道，看样子是急得发了狂。他已经扯下了那副无精打采的面具，全身上下那些着魔一般的邪乎劲儿一下子抽风似地爆发出来。他一把掀开地毯，紧接着就开始在地板上爬来爬去，挨个儿扒拉那些方形的木板。他的指甲抠到了其中一块木板的边缘，木板往上一翘，接着就像盒盖一样绕着活页翻了开来，露出一个黑黢黢的小洞。福尔摩斯迫不及待地把手伸了进去，然后又抽了出来，恨恨地吼了一声，又是恼怒又是失望。洞里什么也没有。","“Now, Watson, now!” cried Holmes, with frenzied eagerness. All the demoniacal force of the man masked behind that listless manner burst out in a paroxysm of energy. He tore the drugget from the floor, and in an instant was down on his hands and knees clawing at each of the squares of wood beneath it. One turned sideways as he dug his nails into the edge of it. It hinged back like the lid of a box. A small black cavity opened beneath it. Holmes plunged his eager hand into it, and drew it out with a bitter snarl of anger and disappointment. It was empty."
"“快，华生，快！赶紧让这儿恢复原样！”我俩刚刚扣上木板、抻平地毯，过道里就传来了雷斯垂德的声音。他走进房间的时候，看到的是福尔摩斯有气无力地倚在壁炉台上，一边无可奈何地耐心等候，一边竭力掩藏抑制不住的哈欠。","“Quick, Watson, quick! Get it back again!” The wooden lid was replaced, and the drugget had only just been drawn straight when Lestrade’s voice was heard in the passage. He found Holmes leaning languidly against the mantelpiece, resigned and patient, endeavouring to conceal his irrepressible yawns."
"“抱歉让你等了这么久，福尔摩斯先生。看得出来，你觉得这些事情无聊得要命。好了，他已经招了，还不错。进来，麦克弗森，给这两位先生说说你这种完全不可饶恕的行为。”","“Sorry to keep you waiting, Mr. Holmes. I can see that you are bored to death with the whole affair. Well, he has confessed, all right. Come in here, MacPherson. Let these gentlemen hear of your most inexcusable conduct.”"
"大块头的警员忸忸怩怩地蹩了进来，红彤彤的脸上写满了悔恨。","The big constable, very hot and penitent, sidled into the room."
"“我没想干什么坏事，先生，真的。昨天傍晚，那位年轻的女士走到了门口。她认错了房子，所以走到了这儿。然后呢，我俩就聊了起来。成天在这儿值班，确实有点儿寂寞。”","“I meant no harm, sir, I’m sure. The young woman came to the door last evening—mistook the house, she did. And then we got talking. It’s lonesome, when you’re on duty here all day.”"
"“那么，接下来怎么样呢？”","“Well, what happened then?”"
"“她想看看凶案是在什么地方发生的，说是在报纸上读到了这件案子。那是个非常体面的年轻女士，而且很会说话，先生，所以我想，让她进去瞄一眼也不要紧。看到地毯上的血迹，她一下子就倒在地板上，躺在那里一动不动，看着跟死了一样。我跑到后面去弄了点儿水，但却怎么也弄不醒她。接下来，我跑到街角的常春藤酒馆，从那里弄了点儿白兰地。等我回来的时候，那位年青女士已经醒过来，自个儿走掉了。我敢说，她肯定是觉得非常害臊，不好意思再跟我碰面了。”","“She wanted to see where the crime was done—had read about it in the papers, she said. She was a very respectable, well-spoken young woman, sir, and I saw no harm in letting her have a peep. When she saw that mark on the carpet, down she dropped on the floor, and lay as if she were dead. I ran to the back and got some water, but I could not bring her to. Then I went round the corner to the Ivy Plant for some brandy, and by the time I had brought it back the young woman had recovered and was off—ashamed of herself, I dare say, and dared not face me.”"
"“地毯有人动过，这又是怎么回事呢？”","“How about moving that drugget?”"
"“呃，先生，我回来的时候，确实看到地毯有点儿皱。您也知道，当时她摔在了地毯上，地毯没有固定，下面的地板又非常滑溜。后来呢，我就把它给抻平了。”","“Well, sir, it was a bit rumpled, certainly, when I came back. You see, she fell on it, and it lies on a polished floor with nothing to keep it in place. I straightened it out afterwards.”"
"“有了这个教训，麦克弗森警员，以后你就应该明白，你是骗不了我的，”雷斯垂德庄严宣告。“毫无疑问，你以为你的渎职行为永远也不会被人察觉，可我只是扫了一眼那张地毯，立刻就断定你放了人进来。你运气不错，伙计，房间里没少什么东西，要不然的话，你的麻烦可就大了去了。不好意思，福尔摩斯先生，为这点儿小事情让你跑了一趟，可我本来以为，你兴许会觉得，两块血迹对不上的事情很有意思。”","“It’s a lesson to you that you can’t deceive me, Constable MacPherson,” said Lestrade, with dignity. “No doubt you thought that your breach of duty could never be discovered, and yet a mere glance at that drugget was enough to convince me that someone had been admitted to the room. It’s lucky for you, my man, that nothing is missing, or you would find yourself in Queer Street. I’m sorry to have called you down over such a petty business, Mr. Holmes, but I thought the point of the second stain not corresponding with the first would interest you.”"
"“确实有意思，有意思极了。那个女人只来过一次吗，警员？”","“Certainly, it was most interesting. Has this woman only been here once, constable?”"
"“是的，先生，只来过一次。”","“Yes, sir, only once.”"
"“知道她是谁吗？”","“Who was she?”"
"“名字我不知道，先生。她是来应征打字员的，不小心弄错了门牌号码。还有，那是个非常讨人喜欢的年青女士，非常斯文，先生。”","“Don’t know the name, sir. Was answering an advertisement about type-writing, and came to the wrong number—very pleasant, genteel young woman, sir.”"
"“高个子？挺好看的？”","“Tall? Handsome?”"
"“是的，先生，那位年青女士个子很高。照我看，您说她长得好看也可以，还有些人没准儿会说她长得特别好看。她跟我说，‘噢，警官，让我进去瞧一眼吧！’这么说吧，她那种口气特别可爱，特别让人心软，所以我就想，让她伸个脑袋进去瞧一瞧也不要紧。”","“Yes, sir; she was a well-grown young woman. I suppose you might say she was handsome. Perhaps some would say she was very handsome. ‘Oh, officer, do let me have a peep!’ says she. She had pretty, coaxing ways, as you might say, and I thought there was no harm in letting her just put her head through the door.”"
"“她什么打扮呢？” ","“How was she dressed?”"
"“挺素净的，先生，穿的是一件拖到脚面的罩袍。”","“Quiet, sir—a long mantle down to her feet.”"
"“这是什么时间的事情？”","“What time was it?”"
"“天刚刚开始黑的时候。我拿着白兰地回来的时候，大家都在掌灯呢。” ","“It was just growing dusk at the time. They were lighting the lamps as I came back with the brandy.”"
"“很好，”福尔摩斯说道，“走吧，华生，依我看，其他地方还有更重要的工作在等咱们呢。”","“Very good,” said Holmes. “Come, Watson, I think that we have more important work elsewhere.”"
"我俩离开屋子的时候，雷斯垂德仍然在前厅里待着，开门放我俩出去的是那名悔过自新的警员。走到门口台阶上的时候，福尔摩斯转过身去，举起了一样东西，警员盯着它看了片刻。","As we left the house Lestrade remained in the front room, while the repentant constable opened the door to let us out. Holmes turned on the step and held up something in his hand. The constable stared intently."
"“天哪，先生！”警员大叫一声，脸上露出了十分惊讶的表情。福尔摩斯把一根手指竖到唇边，又把手里的东西揣到怀里，等我俩走到大街上的时候，他一下子大笑起来。“好极了！”他说道。“走吧，华生老兄，最后一场的幕布已经拉开了。眼下你尽管放心，接下来不会有什么战争，特里劳尼·霍普阁下的锦绣前程不会有什么阴影，那位冒失的君主不会因为冒失受到什么惩罚，首相也不会面对什么欧洲争端，还有啊，咱们只需要用上一丁点儿手腕和策略，这件原本可能酿成巨祸的事情就不会让任何人蒙受哪怕是一丁点儿的损失。”","“Good Lord, sir!” he cried, with amazement on his face.Holmes put his finger on his lips, replaced his hand in his breast-pocket, and burst out laughing as we turned down the street. “Excellent!” said he. “Come, friend Watson, the curtain rings up for the last act. You will be relieved to hear that there will be no war, that the Right Honourable Trelawney Hope will suffer no set-back in his brilliant career, that the indiscreet Sovereign will receive no punishment for his indiscretion, that the Prime Minister will have no European complication to deal with, and that with a little tact and management upon our part nobody will be a penny the worse for what might have been a very ugly incident.”"
"我心里充满了对这位非凡人物的崇敬之情。","My mind filled with admiration for this extraordinary man."
"“问题你已经解决了！”我叫道。","“You have solved it!” I cried."
"“不能这么说，华生。有一些细节跟以前一样，仍然是不清不楚。不过，咱们已经知道了这么多，查不出剩下的就只能怪自个儿笨了。咱们这就直接去白厅巷，把这部戏唱到高潮。”","“Hardly that, Watson. There are some points which are as dark as ever. But we have so much that it will be our own fault if we cannot get the rest. We will go straight to Whitehall Terrace and bring the matter to a head.”"
"我俩赶到欧洲事务大臣私邸的时候，歇洛克 ·福尔摩斯通名求见的是希尔达·特里劳尼·霍普夫人。仆人把我俩领进了日间起居室。","When we arrived at the residence of the European Secretary it was for Lady Hilda Trelawney Hope that Sherlock Holmes inquired. We were shown into the morning-room."
"“福尔摩斯先生！”夫人气得脸泛桃红，“您这可真是太没信用，太没风度了。我跟您说过，希望您不要泄露我去找您的事情，免得我丈夫觉得我干预他的事情。您呢，竟然跑到我这里来，让人知道我跟您有过什么业务来往，这不是坏我的名声嘛。”","“Mr. Holmes!” said the lady, and her face was pink with her indignation, “this is surely most unfair and ungenerous upon your part. I desired, as I have explained, to keep my visit to you a secret, lest my husband should think that I was intruding into his affairs. And yet you compromise me by coming here and so showing that there are business relations between us.”"
"“很不巧，夫人，我实在是别无选择。我受托找回这份极其重要的文件，眼下只能请求夫人您大发慈悲，把文件交到我的手里。”","“Unfortunately, madam, I had no possible alternative. I have been commissioned to recover this immensely important paper. I must therefore ask you, madam, to be kind enough to place it in my hands.”"
"夫人猛一下站起身来，美丽的脸庞转眼变成了一张白纸。她眼色迷茫，身形踉跄，看上去马上就要晕倒。接下来，她拿出一股可钦可佩的力量，挨过了这次冲击，极大的震惊与愤慨占据了她的脸庞，将其他表情通通扫除干净。","The lady sprang to her feet, with the colour all dashed in an instant from her beautiful face. Her eyes glazed— she tottered—I thought that she would faint. Then with a grand effort she rallied from the shock, and a supreme astonishment and indignation chased every other expression from her features."
"“您——您这是人身攻击，福尔摩斯先生。”","“You—you insult me, Mr. Holmes.”"
"“行啦，行啦，夫人，这一套没有用。把信交出来吧。”","“Come, come, madam, it is useless. Give up the letter.”"
"她冲到了唤人铃旁边。","She darted to the bell."
"“管家会送你们出去的。”","“The butler shall show you out.”"
"“别摇铃，希尔达夫人。您要是摇铃的话，等于是白费了我遏止丑闻的一片苦心。把信交出来吧，一切问题都可以解决。只要您跟我合作，我就可以把所有的事情安排好。您要是跟我作对的话，我只好揭穿您的把戏。”","“Do not ring, Lady Hilda. If you do, then all my earnest efforts to avoid a scandal will be frustrated. Give up the letter and all will be set right. If you will work with me I can arrange everything. If you work against me I must expose you.”"
"她无比桀骜地站在那里，身姿宛如一位女王，眼睛则死死地盯着福尔摩斯的眼睛，仿佛是想要看穿他的灵魂。她的手已经放在了铃铛上，不过，她终归还是克制住了摇铃的冲动。","She stood grandly defiant, a queenly figure, her eyes fixed upon his as if she would read his very soul. Her hand was on the bell, but she had forborne to ring it."
"“您这是想吓唬我。您跑到这儿来吓唬一个女人，福尔摩斯先生，这可算不上男子汉大丈夫的行径。您刚才说您知道一些事情，您都知道些什么事情呢？”","“You are trying to frighten me. It is not a very manly thing, Mr. Holmes, to come here and browbeat a woman. You say that you know something. What is it that you know?”"
"“麻烦您坐下吧，夫人。不小心摔一跤的话，您就该伤着自己了。您要是不肯坐下，那我就什么也不说。谢谢您。”","“Pray sit down, madam. You will hurt yourself there if you fall. I will not speak until you sit down. Thank you.”"
"“我给您五分钟的时间，福尔摩斯先生。”","“I give you five minutes, Mr. Holmes.”"
"“一分钟就够了，希尔达夫人。我知道您见过爱德华多·卢卡斯，知道您把这封信给了他，知道您昨天晚上非常机灵地跑回了那个房间，还知道您怎么把信从地毯下面的藏匿地点拿了出来。”","“One is enough, Lady Hilda. I know of your visit to Eduardo Lucas, of your giving him this document, of your ingenious return to the room last night, and of the manner in which you took the letter from the hiding-place under the carpet.”"
"她直勾勾地盯着他，脸色灰败，一连咽了两次口水，这才说出话来。","She stared at him with an ashen face and gulped twice before she could speak."
"“您疯了吧，福尔摩斯先生，您肯定是疯了！”说到最后，她终于喊叫起来。","“You are mad, Mr. Holmes—you are mad!” she cried, at last."
"他从口袋里掏出一张小小的卡片，卡片上是一个女人的头像，头像是从一张相片上剪下来的。","He drew a small piece of cardboard from his pocket. It was the face of a woman cut out of a portrait."
"“我随身带着这样东西，是因为我觉得它可能会派上用场，”他说道。“那名警察认出了它。”","“I have carried this because I thought it might be useful,” said he. “The policeman has recognised it.”"
"她吸了一口凉气，脑袋仰到了椅背上。","She gave a gasp and her head dropped back in the chair."
"“好啦，希尔达夫人。信在您的手里，事情还可以补救。我并不想给您添什么麻烦，我的任务只限于把丢失的信件还给您的丈夫，没有什么别的。希望您接受我的建议，把实情告诉我。这是您唯一的出路。”","“Come, Lady Hilda. You have the letter. The matter may still be adjusted. I have no desire to bring trouble to you. My duty ends when I have returned the lost letter to your husband. Take my advice and be frank with me; it is your only chance.”"
"她的勇气着实可嘉，此时依然不肯投降。","Her courage was admirable. Even now she would not own defeat."
"“我得再跟您说一遍，福尔摩斯先生，您肯定是产生了某种十分荒唐的幻觉。”","“I tell you again, Mr. Holmes, that you are under some absurd illusion.”"
"福尔摩斯站了起来。","Holmes rose from his chair."
"“我真是替您感到遗憾，希尔达夫人。我对您已经仁至义尽，看样子都是枉费心机。”","“I am sorry for you, Lady Hilda. I have done my best for you; I can see that it is all in vain.”"
"他摇响了铃铛，男管家应声而入。 ","He rang the bell. The butler entered."
"“特里劳尼·霍普先生在家吗？”","“Is Mr. Trelawney Hope at home?”"
"“他十二点三刻回来，先生。”","“He will be home, sir, at a quarter to one.”"
"福尔摩斯看了看自己的表。","Holmes glanced at his watch."
"“还差一刻钟，”他说道，“行啦，我等等好了。”","“Still a quarter of an hour,” said he. “Very good, I shall wait.”"
"管家刚刚带上房门，希尔达夫人就跪在了福尔摩斯的脚边。她摊开双手，仰头看着福尔摩斯，美丽的脸庞沾满泪水。","The butler had hardly closed the door behind him when Lady Hilda was down on her knees at Holmes’s feet, her hands out-stretched, her beautiful face upturned and wet with her tears."
"“噢，放过我吧，福尔摩斯先生！放过我吧！”她疯了似的苦苦哀求。“看在老天分上，别告诉他！我实在太爱他了！我不愿给他的生活抹上哪怕是一丝阴影，可我知道，这事情一定会打碎他那颗高贵的心。”","“Oh, spare me, Mr. Holmes! Spare me!” she pleaded, in a frenzy of supplication. “For heaven’s sake, don’t tell him! I love him so! I would not bring one shadow on his life, and this I know would break his noble heart.”"
"福尔摩斯把夫人扶了起来。“谢天谢地，夫人，临到这个最后关头，您终于恢复了理智！咱们一秒钟也不能耽搁。信在哪儿呢？”","Holmes raised the lady. “I am thankful, madam, that you have come to your senses even at this last moment! There is not an instant to lose. Where is the letter?”"
"她冲到房间的另一头，用钥匙打开一张写字台，从里面拿出了一个长条形的蓝色信封。","She darted across to a writing-desk, unlocked it, and drew out a long blue envelope."
"“就在这儿，福尔摩斯先生。老天在上，我要是从来没看见过它就好了！”","“Here it is, Mr. Holmes. Would to heaven I had never seen it!”"
"“咱们怎么把它还回去呢？”福尔摩斯咕哝了一句。“快，快，咱们必须想出个办法来！公文箱在什么地方？”","“How can we return it?” Holmes muttered. “Quick, quick, we must think of some way! Where is the despatch-box?”"
"“这会儿还在他的卧室里。”","“Still in his bedroom.”"
"“咱们的运气真是好！快，夫人，快把它拿到这儿来！”","“What a stroke of luck! Quick, madam, bring it here!”"
"片刻工夫，她已经回到了起居室里，手里拎着一只扁扁的红色箱子。","A moment later she had appeared with a red flat box in her hand."
"“上次您是怎么把它打开的？您有复制的钥匙？是啊，您当然会有。把它打开！”","“How did you open it before? You have a duplicate key? Yes, of course you have. Open it!”"
"希尔达夫人从怀里掏出了一把小小的钥匙。公文箱“啪”的一声弹开了，里面装满了文件。福尔摩斯把蓝色的信封深深地塞到那些文件的中央，把它夹在某份文件的两页之间。接下来，他合上公文箱，夫人把箱子锁上，又把箱子送回了卧室。","From out of her bosom Lady Hilda had drawn a small key. The box flew open. It was stuffed with papers. Holmes thrust the blue envelope deep down into the heart of them, between the leaves of some other document. The box was shut, locked, and returned to the bedroom."
"“好了，他回来也不怕了，”福尔摩斯说道，“咱们还有十分钟的时间。希尔达夫人，我费了这么大的力气来替您打掩护，作为回报，您不妨利用这点儿时间，把这次离奇事件的始末原原本本地告诉我吧。”","“Now we are ready for him,” said Holmes; “we have still ten minutes. I am going far to screen you, Lady Hilda. In return you will spend the time in telling me frankly the real meaning of this extraordinary affair.”"
"“福尔摩斯先生，我这就把一切都告诉您，”夫人高声说道。“噢，福尔摩斯先生，我宁愿砍掉自己的右手，也不愿意带给他片刻的伤心！全伦敦也没有哪个女人能像我这样爱自己的丈夫，可是，要是他知道了我做的事情，应该说是我被迫做的事情，他绝对不会原谅我的。他对自己的要求实在是太过严格，因此也绝不会忘记或者原谅别人的失足。帮帮我，福尔摩斯先生！我的幸福，他的幸福，甚至是我俩的性命，全都看您的了！”","“Mr. Holmes, I will tell you everything,” cried the lady. “Oh, Mr. Holmes, I would cut off my right hand before I gave him a moment of sorrow! There is no woman in all London who loves her husband as I do, and yet if he knew how I have acted—how I have been compelled to act—he would never forgive me. For his own honour stands so high that he could not forget or pardon a lapse in another. Help me, Mr. Holmes! My happiness, his happiness, our very lives are at stake!”"
"“快，夫人，时间不多了！”","“Quick, madam, the time grows short!”"
"“事情的由头是我写的一封信，福尔摩斯先生，那封信是我结婚之前写的，内容不太谨慎，可以说是非常愚蠢，让爱情冲昏了头脑的姑娘就是这么写信。那封信本来无伤大雅，他却会觉得它非常可耻。要是读到了那封信的话，他对我的信任就会荡然无存。写信的事情已经过去了好些年，我还以为整件事情都已经烟消云散了呢。没想到，我最终还是收到了卢卡斯这个家伙写来的信，信里说我的信到了他的手里，而他打算把信交给我的丈夫。我恳求他放过我，他回答说，我丈夫的公文箱里有一份什么什么样子的文件，如果我把文件拿给他，他就可以把信还给我。政府里有他安插的间谍，文件的事情是那个间谍告诉他的。他还信誓旦旦地告诉我，这件事情绝不会连累我的丈夫。您设身处地地替我想想吧，福尔摩斯先生！我还能怎么办呢？”","“It was a letter of mine, Mr. Holmes, an indiscreet letter written before my marriage—a foolish letter, a letter of an impulsive, loving girl. I meant no harm, and yet he would have thought it criminal. Had he read that letter his confidence would have been forever destroyed. It is years since I wrote it. I had thought that the whole matter was forgotten. Then at last I heard from this man, Lucas, that it had passed into his hands, and that he would lay it before my husband. I implored his mercy. He said that he would return my letter if I would bring him a certain document which he described in my husband’s despatch-box. He had some spy in the office who had told him of its existence. He assured me that no harm could come to my husband. Put yourself in my position, Mr. Holmes! What was I to do?”"
"“把事情告诉您的丈夫。”","“Take your husband into your confidence.”"
"“不行啊，福尔摩斯先生，不行！这一边显然是确定无疑的毁灭，另一边呢，拿我丈夫的文件虽说也显得非常可怕，可它终归是件政治范畴的事情，我并不清楚后果如何，与此同时，关于爱和信任的这件事情，后果我却是再清楚不过了。我拿了，福尔摩斯先生！我取了钥匙的模子，卢卡斯这个家伙帮我复制了一把。我打开丈夫的公文箱，拿走文件，还把文件送到了高道芬街。”","“I could not, Mr. Holmes, I could not! On the one side seemed certain ruin; on the other, terrible as it seemed to take my husband’s paper, still in a matter of politics I could not understand the consequences, while in a matter of love and trust they were only too clear to me. I did it, Mr. Holmes! I took an impression of his key; this man Lucas furnished a duplicate. I opened his despatch-box, took the paper, and conveyed it to Godolphin Street.”"
"“那边的情形怎样呢，夫人？”","“What happened there, madam?”"
"“我按约定的方法敲了敲门，卢卡斯给我开了门。我跟着他走进了他的房间，没有把屋门关严，因为我害怕跟这个人单独相处。我还记得，进屋的时候，我看见屋外有个女人。没一会儿，我俩就做完了交易。他已经提前把我的信摆在了写字台上，我把文件给他，他就把信给了我。就在这个时候，屋门响了一下，过道里传来了脚步声。卢卡斯飞快地翻开地毯，把文件塞进了地板上一个藏东西的地方，然后又把地毯盖了回去。","“I tapped at the door as agreed. Lucas opened it. I followed him into his room, leaving the hall door ajar behind me, for I feared to be alone with the man. I remember that there was a woman outside as I entered. Our business was soon done. He had my letter on his desk; I handed him the document. He gave me the letter. At this instant there was a sound at the door. There were steps in the passage. Lucas quickly turned back the drugget, thrust the document into some hiding-place there, and covered it over."
"“接下来的事情简直是一场噩梦，我突然看见了一张疯疯癫癫的黝黑面孔，听见了一个女人的声音，那声音用法语高叫，‘我可算没有白等。到头来，到头来我终于把你们俩捉了双！’然后就是一场野蛮的打斗，我看见他抄起了一把椅子，她拿的则是一把寒光闪闪的刀子。我赶紧逃出那个恐怖的现场，逃离了那座房子，第二天早上才从报纸上看到这件事情的可怕下文。当天晚上我还是挺高兴的，因为我拿回了自己的信，那时又不知道后来会发生什么事情。","“What happened after that is like some fearful dream. I have a vision of a dark, frantic face, of a woman’s voice, which screamed in French, ‘My waiting is not in vain. At last, at last I have found you with her!’ There was a savage struggle. I saw him with a chair in his hand, a knife gleamed in hers. I rushed from the horrible scene, ran from the house, and only next morning in the paper did I learn the dreadful result. That night I was happy, for I had my letter, and I had not seen yet what the future would bring."
"“到了第二天早上，我才明白过来，自己不过是把旧的烦恼换成了新的。我丈夫发现文件丢了，痛苦的样子真让我揪心。我差一点儿就当场跪在了他的脚下，把我做的事情告诉了他。可是，那样做的话，我还是得坦白自己的过去。同一天上午，我就去找了您，为的是搞清楚我的过失究竟有多么严重。从我意识到事情的严重性之后，我脑子里就只有一个念头，那就是设法把我丈夫的文件拿回来。文件肯定还在卢卡斯搁的那个地方，因为在那个可怕的女人闯进房间之前，他已经藏好了文件。要不是那个女人刚好跑来的话，我是绝对不可能知道他藏东西的地方的。怎样才能走进那个房间呢？我跑到那个地方，接连观察了两天，屋门从来都没有不小心敞着的时候。昨天晚上，我进行了一次最后的尝试。我做了些什么，目的是怎么达到的，您都已经知道了。我带着文件回了家，当时还想过把它毁掉，因为我想不出一个两全的办法，既能把文件还回去，又不用向我丈夫坦白自己的过失。天哪，我听到他上楼的声音了！”","“It was the next morning that I realized that I had only exchanged one trouble for another. My husband’s anguish at the loss of his paper went to my heart. I could hardly prevent myself from there and then kneeling down at his feet and telling him what I had done. But that again would mean a confession of the past. I came to you that morning in order to understand the full enormity of my offence. From the instant that I grasped it my whole mind was turned to the one thought of getting back my husband’s paper. It must still be where Lucas had placed it, for it was concealed before this dreadful woman entered the room. If it had not been for her coming, I should not have known where his hiding-place was. How was I to get into the room? For two days I watched the place, but the door was never left open. Last night I made a last attempt. What I did and how I succeeded, you have already learned. I brought the paper back with me, and thought of destroying it since I could see no way of returning it, without confessing my guilt to my husband."
"紧接着，欧洲事务大臣万分激动地冲进了房间。","The European Secretary burst excitedly into the room."
"“有消息吗，福尔摩斯先生，有消息吗？”他高声问道。","“Any news, Mr. Holmes, any news?” he cried."
"“有点儿希望。”","“I have some hopes.”"
"“噢，谢天谢地！”他的脸一下子亮了起来。“首相已经来了，正打算跟我一起吃午饭。您能把您的希望讲给他听听吗？他虽然拥有钢铁一般的神经，可我确实知道，这件可怕的事情发生之后，他几乎是没有合过眼。雅各布斯，你能下楼去请首相上来吗？你呢，亲爱的，我们要谈的事情恐怕会牵扯到政治。你先去餐厅吧，我们过几分钟就来找你。”","“Ah, thank heaven!” His face became radiant. “The Prime Minister is lunching with me. May he share your hopes? He has nerves of steel, and yet I know that he has hardly slept since this terrible event. Jacobs, will you ask the Prime Minister to come up? As to you, dear, I fear that this is a matter of politics. We will join you in a few minutes in the dining-room.”"
"首相表现得相当克制，不过，看到他闪闪发亮的双眼，还有他颤抖不已的枯瘦双手，我立刻知道，他心里的激动并不亚于他这位年轻的同僚。","The Prime Minister’s manner was subdued, but I could see by the gleam of his eyes and the twitchings of his bony hands that he shared the excitement of his young colleague."
"“福尔摩斯先生，听说您带来了一些消息，对吗？”","“I understand that you have something to report, Mr. Holmes?”"
"“目前还只有坏消息，”我朋友回答道，“不过，文件可能出现的地方我都已经查过了，而且我可以肯定，眼下并没有什么值得担忧的险情。”","“Purely negative as yet,” my friend answered. “I have inquired at every point where it might be, and I am sure that there is no danger to be apprehended.”"
"“这样是不够的，福尔摩斯先生。我们可不能坐在这样的一个火山口上过日子。文件必须得有确切的下落才行。”","“But that is not enough, Mr. Holmes. We cannot live forever on such a volcano. We must have something definite.”"
"“要我说，确切的下落还是有希望找到的，所以我才上这儿来。越是琢磨这件事情，我越是觉得，这封信从来都没有离开过这座房子。 ”","“I am in hopes of getting it. That is why I am here. The more I think of the matter the more convinced I am that the letter has never left this house.”"
"“福尔摩斯先生！”","“Mr. Holmes!”"
"“如果它离开过的话，眼下肯定已经泄露出来了。”","“If it had it would certainly have been public by now.”"
"“可是，偷信的人干吗要把信藏在原主的家里呢？”","“But why should anyone take it in order to keep it in his house?”"
"“我倒不觉得有人偷信。”","“I am not convinced that anyone did take it.”"
"“既然如此，信为什么会从公文箱里消失呢？”","“Then how could it leave the despatch-box?”"
"“我倒不觉得，信曾经从公文箱里消失。”","“I am not convinced that it ever did leave the despatch-box.”"
"“福尔摩斯先生，您这个玩笑开得可不是时候。我可以跟您保证，信确实从公文箱里消失了。”","“Mr. Holmes, this joking is very ill-timed. You have my assurance that it left the box.”"
"“周二早上之后，您仔细检查过公文箱吗？”","“Have you examined the box since Tuesday morning?”"
"“没检查过，也没有这个必要。”","“No; it was not necessary.”"
"“您一时疏忽没看到信，这也不是不可能的。”","“You may conceivably have overlooked it.”"
"“要我说就是不可能。”","“Impossible, I say.”"
"“我倒不觉得这不可能，同样的事情以前我也见过。依我看，公文箱里肯定还装着别的文件。这么说吧，信兴许是跟别的文件混在了一起。”","“But I am not convinced of it; I have known such things to happen. I presume there are other papers there. Well, it may have got mixed with them.”"
"“信是摆在最上面的。”","“It was on the top.”"
"“兴许有人晃动过公文箱，信掉到了别的地方。”","“Someone may have shaken the box and displaced it.”"
"“不对，这不可能，当时我把所有的东西都掏了出来。”","“No, no; I had everything out.”"
"“这一点很容易弄明白，霍普，”首相插了一句，“把公文箱拿过来看看就行了。”","“Surely it is easily decided, Hope,” said the Premier. “Let us have the despatch-box brought in.”"
"欧洲事务大臣摇了摇铃铛。","The Secretary rang the bell."
"“雅各布斯，把我的公文箱拿下来。这样的闹剧完全是浪费时间，不过，如果您非得这样才满意的话，我也就遂您的愿。谢谢你，雅各布斯，箱子放这儿就行了。我一直都把箱子的钥匙穿在表链上，您瞧，文件都在这里。这是梅罗勋爵写来的信，这是查尔斯·哈迪爵士交来的报告，这是来自贝尔格莱德的备忘录，这是关于德俄农作物关税协定的说明，这是从马德里来的信，这是弗劳尔勋爵写来的短笺——天哪！这是什么？贝林格勋爵！贝林格勋爵！”","“Jacobs, bring down my despatch-box. This is a farcical waste of time, but still, if nothing else will satisfy you, it shall be done. Thank you, Jacobs; put it here. I have always had the key on my watch-chain. Here are the papers, you see. Letter from Lord Merrow, report from Sir Charles Hardy, memorandum from Belgrade, note on the Russo-German grain taxes, letter from Madrid, note from Lord Flower—Good heavens! what is this? Lord Bellinger! Lord Bellinger!”"
"首相一把抓过了欧洲事务大臣手里的蓝色信封。","The Premier snatched the blue envelope from his hand."
"“没错，就是它——而且没有拆过。霍普，我向你表示祝贺。”","“Yes, it is it—and the letter is intact. Hope, I congratulate you.”"
"“谢谢您！谢谢您！我心里这块大石头可算是落了地。可是，这事情简直没法想象——实际上是绝对不可能。福尔摩斯先生，您真是个天才，真是个魔法师！您怎么知道信在公文箱里呢？”","“Thank you! Thank you! What a weight from my heart. But this is inconceivable—impossible. Mr. Holmes, you are a wizard, a sorcerer! How did you know it was there?”"
"“因为我知道，它不在其他的任何地方。”","“Because I knew it was nowhere else.”"
"“我简直不敢相信自己的眼睛！”他发疯似的跑到了门口。“我妻子在哪儿呢？我必须马上告诉她，所有的问题都已经解决了。希尔达！希尔达！”转眼之间，他的声音已经到了楼梯上。","“I cannot believe my eyes!” He ran wildly to the door. “Where is my wife? I must tell her that all is well. Hilda! Hilda!” we heard his voice on the stairs."
"首相紧盯着福尔摩斯，双眼炯炯放光。","The Premier looked at Holmes with twinkling eyes."
"“说吧，先生，”他说道。“事情绝不像看起来这么简单。信是怎么回到公文箱里去的呢？”","“Come, sir,” said he. “There is more in this than meets the eye. How came the letter back in the box?”"
"福尔摩斯微笑着扭开了脸，躲开了那双锐利眼睛的咄咄逼视。","Holmes turned away smiling from the keen scrutiny of those wonderful eyes."
"“我们也有我们的外交秘密，”说完之后，他拿起帽子，转身向门口走去。","“We also have our diplomatic secrets,” said he, and picking up his hat he turned to the door."
