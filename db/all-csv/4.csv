"第一章 姐妹俩","CHAPTER 1 THE SISTERS"
"对他而言，这一次是没有任何希望了：这是第三次中风了。一夜又一夜，我走过那所房子（时值假期），端详那灯光映照下的方窗框：一夜又一夜，我发现那窗框里都亮着同样的灯光，微弱而匀和。假如他死了，我想，我会在变暗的百叶窗上看到烛光的影子，因为我知道人们要在死者的头边放置两根蜡烛。他经常对我讲：“我将不久于人世了。”而我一直都认为他的话毫无意义。现在我才知道它们都是真的。每个夜晚，当我抬头注视着那扇窗时，我总会轻轻地对自己说“瘫痪”这个词。在我听来，它总是有些奇怪，就像欧几里得几何中“磬折形”一词以及教义问答手册里“买卖圣职罪”一词。然而现在在我听来它却像是某种作恶多端、罪行累累的生物的名字。它让我充满恐惧，可我又渴望能离它更近一些，以便去观察它完成那致命的工作。","THERE was no hope for him this time: it was the third stroke.Night after night I had passed the house (it was vacation time) and studied the lighted square of window: and night after night I had found it lighted in the same way, faintly and evenly.If he was dead, I thought, I would see the reflection of candles on the darkened blind for I knew that two candles must be set at the head of a corpse.He had often said to me: “I am not long for this world,” and I had thought his words idle.Now I knew they were true.Every night as I gazed up at the window I said softly to myself the word paralysis.It had always sounded strangely in my ears, like the word gnomon in the Euclid and the word simony in the Catechism.But now it sounded to me like the name of some maleficent and sinful being.It filled me with fear, and yet I longed to be nearer to it and to look upon its deadly work."
"我下楼来吃晚饭的时候，老科特正坐在火炉边抽烟。姨妈给我盛麦片粥的时候，他仿佛是重拾先前的某个话头似的说道：","Old Cotter was sitting at the fire, smoking, when I came downstairs to supper.While my aunt was ladling out my stirabout he said, as if returning to some former remark of his:"
"“不，我不是说他就是……可是有些地方不对头……他有点古怪。我要告诉你们我的看法……”他开始猛吸烟斗，无疑是在整理自己脑子里的想法。讨厌的老傻瓜！我们刚认识他的时候，他还相当有趣，常常谈论劣质酒精和蜗杆；但是我很快就对他这个人以及他那些没完没了的关于酒厂的故事感到厌烦了。","“No, I wouldn’t say he was exactly... but there was something queer... there was something uncanny about him.I’ll tell you my opinion....”He began to puff at his pipe, no doubt arranging his opinion in his mind.Tiresome old fool!When we knew him first he used to be rather interesting, talking of faints and worms; but I soon grew tired of him and his endless stories about the distillery."
"“关于酿酒我有我自己的看法。”他说，“我认为它是那些……特殊情况之一……但是很难说……”","“I have my own theory about it,” he said.“I think it was one of those... peculiar cases.... But it’s hard to say....”"
"他又开始猛吸烟斗，却没有给我们讲他的看法。姨父看见我在凝神发呆，就对我说：","He began to puff again at his pipe without giving us his theory.My uncle saw me staring and said to me:"
"“唉，你的老朋友去世了，你听了肯定很难过。”","“Well, so your old friend is gone, you’ll be sorry to hear.”"
"“谁？”我说。","“Who?” said I."
"“弗林神父。”","“Father Flynn.”"
"“他死了？”","“Is he dead?”"
"“科特先生刚刚告诉我们的。他来时路过了那所房子。”","“Mr. Cotter here has just told us. He was passing by the house.”"
"我知道自己正处于众目睽睽之下，所以就继续吃饭，仿佛这个消息并没有激发我的兴趣。姨父向老科特解释道：","I knew that I was under observation so I continued eating as if the news had not interested me. My uncle explained to old Cotter."
"“这个年轻人和他是很要好的朋友。要知道，那老家伙教给了他不少东西；人们说他对这孩子有很高的期望。”","“The youngster and he were great friends.The old chap taught him a great deal, mind you; and they say he had a great wish for him.”"
"“愿上帝怜悯他的灵魂。”姨妈虔诚地说。","“God have mercy on his soul,” said my aunt piously."
"老科特盯着我看了一会儿。我感觉到他那双亮闪闪的小黑眼睛在审视我，可我不愿让他得逞，所以并没有从盘子上抬起头来。他又开始抽他的烟斗，最后冲壁炉里粗鲁地吐了一口痰。","Old Cotter looked at me for a while.I felt that his little beady black eyes were examining me but I would not satisfy him by looking up from my plate.He returned to his pipe and finally spat rudely into the grate."
"“我可不愿意让我的孩子们，”他说，“去和那样的一个人有太多的话可说。”","“I wouldn’t like children of mine,” he said, “to have too much to say to a man like that.”"
"“您想说什么呢，科特先生？”姨妈问道。","“How do you mean, Mr. Cotter?” asked my aunt."
"“我是想说，”老科特说，“那对孩子们不好。我的看法是：要让一个小伙子到处跑跑，和与他同龄的伙计们玩，而不是……我说的对吧，杰克？”","“What I mean is,” said old Cotter, “it’s bad for children.My idea is: let a young lad run about and play with young lads of his own age and not be... Am I right, Jack?”"
"“这也是我的原则，”姨父说，“要让他学着闯出自己的一片天地。这也是我总是对那边那位玫瑰十字会会员说的话：多做锻炼。啊，想当年我是个小毛孩的时候，每天早上我都要洗个冷水澡，无论冬夏。而这也是我现在依然坚持的习惯。学校教育倒也是不错……科特先生可以来一块羊腿肉。”他又冲着姨妈说道。","“That’s my principle, too,” said my uncle.“Let him learn to box his corner.That’s what I’m always saying to that Rosicrucian there: take exercise.Why, when I was a nipper every morning of my life I had a cold bath, winter and summer.And that’s what stands to me now.Education is all very fine and large.... Mr. Cotter might take a pick of that leg mutton,” he added to my aunt."
"“不了，不了，别给我了。”老科特说道。","“No, no, not for me,” said old Cotter."
"姨妈从橱柜里取出了那盘羊腿肉放到了桌子上。","My aunt brought the dish from the safe and put it on the table."
"“可是，科特先生，您为什么觉得那对孩子们不好呢？”她问道。","“But why do you think it’s not good for children, Mr. Cotter?” she asked."
"“那对孩子们不好，” 老科特说，“因为他们的思想很容易受影响。当孩子们看到此类事情的时候，你知道，它会产生一种影响……”","“It’s bad for children,” said old Cotter, “because their mind are so impressionable.When children see things like that, you know, it has an effect....”"
"我往嘴里填塞着麦片粥，唯恐自己会怒气爆发。讨厌的红鼻子老傻瓜！","I crammed my mouth with stirabout for fear I might give utterance to my anger.Tiresome old red-nosed imbecile!"
"夜深的时候我才入睡。尽管我很生气老科特说我是小孩子，但我还是使劲在脑子里琢磨着他那没有讲完的话中所隐含的意思。房间里漆黑一片，我想象着我又看到了中风病人那张忧郁而灰白的脸。我把毯子拉上来盖住头，试着去想圣诞节。但是那张灰白的脸仍然追着我。它低语着，我明白它很想要诉说些什么。我感到自己的灵魂退隐到了某个舒适而又堕落的地方；在那里，我又发现它在等我。它开始喃喃地向我倾诉，我不知道它为什么一直在笑，为什么它的双唇被唾沫弄得那样湿润。可是很快我想起它已经死于瘫痪，我感觉我也开始无力地微笑，仿佛是要赦免他买卖圣职的罪行。","It was late when I fell asleep.Though I was angry with old Cotter for alluding to me as a child, I puzzled my head to extract meaning from his unfinished sentences.In the dark of my room I imagined that I saw again the heavy grey face of the paralytic.I drew the blankets over my head and tried to think of Christmas.But the grey face still followed me. It murmured, and I understood that it desired to confess something.I felt my soul receding into some pleasant and vicious region; and there again I found it waiting for me. It began to confess to me in a murmuring voice and I wondered why it smiled continually and why the lips were so moist with spittle.But then I remembered that it had died of paralysis and I felt that I too was smiling feebly as if to absolve the simoniac of his sin."
"第二天早晨，早饭过后，我去看了位于大不列颠街上的那所小房子。这是家不起眼的商店，是以“织物”这样一个意思含混的名字登记在册的。而所谓的织物主要包括儿童毛线鞋和雨伞；平时，一则告示常常挂在窗口，上面写着：雨伞换面。现在告示看不见了，因为百叶窗都关着。一把黑绉纱做的花束用丝带绑在门环上。两个穷女人和一个送电报的男孩正在读黑绉纱上别着的那张卡片。我也走上前去，看了起来：","The next morning after breakfast I went down to look at the little house in Great Britain Street.It was an unassuming shop, registered under the vague name of Drapery.The drapery consisted mainly of children’s bootees and umbrellas; and on ordinary days a notice used to hang in the window, saying: Umbrellas Re-covered.No notice was visible now for the shutters were up. A crape bouquet was tied to the doorknocker with ribbon.Two poor women and a telegram boy were reading the card pinned on the crape.I also approached and read:"
"1895年7月1日詹姆斯·弗林神父（曾供职于米斯街的圣凯瑟琳教堂），享年六十五岁。愿他安息。","July 1st, 1895The Rev. James Flynn (formerly of S. Catherine’s Church, Meath Street), aged sixty-five years.R. I. P."
"读了这张卡片，我才确信他是死了，我心烦意乱，一步也走不动。要是他没死的话，我就会到商店后面的那间小黑屋里去，就会看到他坐在火炉旁边的扶手椅里，整个人几乎都严严实实地包裹在大衣里。姨妈也可能会让我带给他一包高杯牌鼻烟，而这个礼物则会让他从昏昏沉沉的瞌睡中醒过来。每次总是我把这包烟倒进他那黑色的鼻烟壶里，因为他的手抖得太厉害，让他来做的话就会把一半的鼻烟都撒到地板上。甚至当他用那只颤抖的大手把烟凑到鼻子跟前的时候也总会有许多小片的烟粉从指缝中落到他的大衣前襟上。很可能正是这些经常落下的烟粉使他那古旧的神父服呈现出一种消褪的绿色，而他试图用来拂去这些鼻烟粉粒的那块红手帕也很不管用。由于沾满了一个星期的鼻烟污渍，那手帕一直都是黑乎乎的。","The reading of the card persuaded me that he was dead and I was disturbed to find myself at check.Had he not been dead I would have gone into the little dark room behind the shop to find him sitting in his arm-chair by the fire, nearly smothered in his great-coat.Perhaps my aunt would have given me a packet of High Toast for him and this present would have roused him from his stupefied doze.It was always I who emptied the packet into his black snuff-box for his hands trembled too much to allow him to do this without spilling half the snuff about the floor.Even as he raised his large trembling hand to his nose little clouds of smoke dribbled through his fingers over the front of his coat.It may have been these constant showers of snuff which gave his ancient priestly garments their green faded look for the red handkerchief, blackened, as it always was, with the snuff-stains of a week, with which he tried to brush away the fallen grains, was quite inefficacious."
"我想进去看看他，但我却没有勇气上去敲门。我沿着阳光照耀的那侧街道默默地走开，一路看着商店橱窗里所有的剧院海报。我觉得有些奇怪，我和那天色似乎都没有处于悲哀的情绪之中，我甚至感到有些恼火，因为发现自己内心居然有一种重获自由的感觉，仿佛因为他的死而使我从某种束缚中解放了出来。我对此感到不解，因为正如我姨父前一天晚上所说的那样，他教会了我许多东西。他曾经在罗马的爱尔兰学院学习过，他教会了我正确地读念拉丁文。他曾经给我讲过关于地下墓穴以及拿破仑·波拿巴的故事，他还曾经给我解释过各种弥撒仪式以及神父所穿的不同法衣的含义。有时他会通过向我提出难解的问题来寻开心，问我在特定情况下应该怎么做，或者问我某种罪行是致命的还是可宽恕的抑或只是些毛病而已。他的问题让我明白教会的某些制度是如何复杂和神秘，而我先前一直把它们看作是些再简单不过的规定。神父对圣餐以及忏悔室的秘密所负的责任在我看来是如此重大，我很想明白何以有人能鼓起足够的勇气去承担它们；而当他告诉我说，教堂的神父们曾写过像《邮局手册》一样厚、排版得像报纸上的法律公告一样密集的书来阐明所有这些错综复杂的问题时，我已经不觉得惊讶了。每每想到这一点，我总是无法给出答案或者只能给出一个非常愚蠢、非常含混的答案，对此，他总是报以微笑，同时还点两三下头。有时他会考考我他曾叫我用心记住的举行弥撒所需的应答短诗；当我叽里呱啦诵读的时候，他总是若有所思地微笑点头，时不时地轮流往两个鼻孔里塞大撮大撮的鼻烟。他微笑的时候常常会露出大颗大颗变色的牙齿，舌头则总是贴在下嘴唇上——这个习惯在我刚认识他、还没跟他熟识之前曾让我感到很不舒服。 ","I wished to go in and look at him but I had not the courage to knock.I walked away slowly along the sunny side of the street, reading all the theatrical advertisements in the shop-windows as I went.I found it strange that neither I nor the day seemed in a mourning mood and I felt even annoyed at discovering in myself a sensation of freedom as if I had been freed from something by his death.I wondered at this for, as my uncle had said the night before, he had taught me a great deal.He had studied in the Irish college in Rome and he had taught me to pronounce Latin properly.He had told me stories about the catacombs and about Napoleon Bonaparte, and he had explained to me the meaning of the different ceremonies of the Mass and of the different vestments worn by the priest.Sometimes he had amused himself by putting difficult questions to me, asking me what one should do in certain circumstances or whether such and such sins were mortal or venial or only imperfections.His questions showed me how complex and mysterious were certain institutions of the Church which I had always regarded as the simplest acts.The duties of the priest towards the Eucharist and towards the secrecy of the confessional seemed so grave to me that I wondered how anybody had ever found in himself the courage to undertake them; and I was not surprised when he told me that the fathers of the Church had written books as thick as the Post Office Directory and as closely printed as the law notices in the newspaper, elucidating all these intricate questions.Often when I thought of this I could make no answer or only a very foolish and halting one upon which he used to smile and nod his head twice or thrice.Sometimes he used to put me through the responses of the Mass which he had made me learn by heart; and, as I pattered, he used to smile pensively and nod his head, now and then pushing huge pinches of snuff up each nostril alternately.When he smiled he used to uncover his big discoloured teeth and let his tongue lie upon his lower lip—a habit which had made me feel uneasy in the beginning of our acquaintance before I knew him well."
"我在阳光下往前走着的时候，想起了老科特的话，然后开始极力回忆在梦里后来到底发生了什么。我记起我看到了长长的天鹅绒窗帘，还有一盏摇摆不定的古老的吊灯。我感觉我已经走了很远，到了某个风俗奇特的地方——是在波斯吧，也许……但我却记不起梦的结局了。","As I walked along in the sun I remembered old Cotter’s words and tried to remember what had happened afterwards in the dream.I remembered that I had noticed long velvet curtains and a swinging lamp of antique fashion.I felt that I had been very far away, in some land where the customs were strange—in Persia, I thought.... But I could not remember the end of the dream."
"傍晚，姨妈带我去了办丧事的那所房子。当时已过了日落时分；但房子向西的玻璃窗上仍反射有一大片云堆呈现出的金褐色的余光。南妮在前厅里迎接我们；由于冲她大声喊叫会显得不太得体，所以姨妈只是和她握了握手。老妇人带有询问意味地向上指了指，见姨妈点了点头，便开始在我们前面沿着狭窄的楼梯费力地往上爬，她的头向下低得几乎和旁边的栏杆一样高。在第一个楼梯平台上，她停了下来，招呼我们朝停放死者的那间屋子敞开的门走去。姨妈走了进去，老妇人见我犹豫不决，就又开始用手不停地招呼我。","In the evening my aunt took me with her to visit the house of mourning.It was after sunset; but the window-panes of the houses that looked to the west reflected the tawny gold of a great bank of clouds.Nannie received us in the hall; and, as it would have been unseemly to have shouted at her, my aunt shook hands with her for all. The old woman pointed upwards interrogatively and, on my aunt’s nodding, proceeded to toil up the narrow staircase before us, her bowed head being scarcely above the level of the banister-rail.At the first landing she stopped and beckoned us forward encouragingly towards the open door of the dead-room.My aunt went in and the old woman, seeing that I hesitated to enter, began to beckon to me again repeatedly with her hand."
"我蹑手蹑脚地走了进去。透过百叶窗的花边，昏暗的金色光芒弥漫到整个屋子里，使得蜡烛的光亮看起来有些苍白而微弱。他已经被放入棺材。南妮带头，我们三个跪在了棺脚边。我假装开始祈祷但却无法集中自己的思绪，因为老妇人在一旁的嘟哝声分散了我的注意力。我注意到她的裙子后面是怎样笨拙地扣在一起，还有她那布靴的鞋跟怎样被踩得偏向了一侧。恍惚之中我仿佛看到老神父正躺在他的棺材里微笑。","I went in on tiptoe.The room through the lace end of the blind was suffused with dusky golden light amid which the candles looked like pale thin flames.He had been coffined.Nannie gave the lead and we three knelt down at the foot of the bed.I pretended to pray but I could not gather my thoughts because the old woman’s mutterings distracted me.I noticed how clumsily her skirt was hooked at the back and how the heels of her cloth boots were trodden down all to one side.The fancy came to me that the old priest was smiling as he lay there in his coffin."
"但是他没有。当我们起身走到棺头旁边的时候，我看到他并没有微笑。他躺在那里，看上去庄严而博学，穿戴得像是要去祭坛，那双大手里松松地揽着一个圣杯。他的脸看上去灰暗而硕大，神情蛮横，鼻孔仿佛两个黑洞，脸颊周围长着一圈稀疏的白毛。屋子里有一股浓烈的味道——是那些花散发出来的。","But no. When we rose and went up to the head of the bed I saw that he was not smiling.There he lay, solemn and copious, vested as for the altar, his large hands loosely retaining a chalice.His face was very truculent, grey and massive, with black cavernous nostrils and circled by a scanty white fur.There was a heavy odour in the room—the flowers."
"我们各自在身前画了十字，然后离开。在楼下的小屋里，我们看见伊丽莎正端坐在他那把扶手椅里。我摸索着朝角落里那把我平时常坐的椅子走去，而南妮则到橱柜里取出了一瓶雪利酒和几个酒杯。她把这些东西放在桌子上，邀请我们大家都喝上一小杯酒。然后，在她姐姐的吩咐下，她把雪利酒倒入酒杯，然后端给了我们大家。她极力劝说我再吃些奶油饼干，但我谢绝了，因为我怕吃那些饼干会弄出很大的声响。对于我的拒绝，她显得有些失望，于是就安静地走到沙发跟前在她姐姐身后坐了下来。谁都没有说话：我们全都凝视着空荡荡的壁炉。","We crossed ourselves and came away.In the little room downstairs we found Eliza seated in his arm-chair in state.I groped my way towards my usual chair in the corner while Nannie went to the sideboard and brought out a decanter of sherry and some wine-glasses.She set these on the table and invited us to take a little glass of wine.Then, at her sister’s bidding, she filled out the sherry into the glasses and passed them to us.She pressed me to take some cream crackers also but I declined because I thought I would make too much noise eating them.She seemed to be somewhat disappointed at my refusal and went over quietly to the sofa where she sat down behind her sister.No one spoke: we all gazed at the empty fireplace."
"一直等到伊丽莎叹了口气，姨妈才开口说道：","My aunt waited until Eliza sighed and then said:"
"“啊，好了，他已经去了一个更好的世界。”","“Ah, well, he’s gone to a better world.”"
"伊丽莎又叹了口气，点点头表示赞同。姨妈用手指摸了摸高脚酒杯的杯脚，然后呷了一小口酒。","Eliza sighed again and bowed her head in assent.My aunt fingered the stem of her wine-glass before sipping a little."
"“他走得……平静吗？”她问道。","“Did he... peacefully?” she asked."
"“哦，非常平静，夫人。”伊丽莎说道，“你都无法得知他的呼吸是什么时候停止的。他死得很美，感谢上帝。”“那么一切都……？”","“Oh, quite peacefully, ma’am,” said Eliza.“You couldn’t tell when the breath went out of him.He had a beautiful death, God be praised.”“And everything...?”"
"“奥鲁尔克神父星期二和他在一起，给他涂了圣油，为他准备好了一切。”","“Father O’Rourke was in with him a Tuesday and anointed him and prepared him and all.”"
"“当时他清醒吗？”","“He knew then?”"
"“他很顺从。”","“He was quite resigned.”"
"“他看起来很顺从。”姨妈说道。","“He looks quite resigned,” said my aunt."
"“这也是我们叫进去给他清洗的那个女人所说的话。她说他看上去就仿佛是睡着了，他看上去是那么安详和顺从。谁都想不到他死了的样子还能这么美。”","“That’s what the woman we had in to wash him said.She said he just looked as if he was asleep, he looked that peaceful and resigned.No one would think he’d make such a beautiful corpse.”"
"“是啊，的确如此。”姨妈说道。","“Yes, indeed,” said my aunt."
"她又从酒杯里呷了一小口酒，然后说道：","She sipped a little more from her glass and said:"
"“呃，弗林小姐，无论如何你们已经为他尽力了，明白这一点一定会给你们很大的宽慰的。你们俩待他都非常好，我得说。”","“Well, Miss Flynn, at any rate it must be a great comfort for you to know that you did all you could for him.You were both very kind to him, I must say.”"
"伊丽莎抚平了膝头的裙子。","Eliza smoothed her dress over her knees."
"“唉，可怜的詹姆斯！”她说，“上帝知道我们做了所有我们能做的一切，尽管我们穷成这样——我们也不愿意看到他在那里头还缺少什么东西。”","“Ah, poor James!” she said.“God knows we done all we could, as poor as we are—we wouldn’t see him want anything while he was in it.”"
"南妮已经把头靠在了沙发靠枕上，看上去像是马上就会睡着。","Nannie had leaned her head against the sofa-pillow and seemed about to fall asleep."
"“可怜的南妮,” 伊丽莎看着她说道, “她累坏了。她和我，我们做的所有这些活儿，包括找那个女人给他清洗，把他抬出来，放进棺材，然后又安排教堂里做弥撒。要是没有奥鲁尔克神父我不知道我们究竟能做什么。正是他从教堂给我们拿来所有的鲜花和那两个烛台，写了那份登在《自由民日报》上的公告，还负责处理所有和墓地那边有关的文件以及可怜的詹姆斯的保险。”","“There’s poor Nannie,” said Eliza, looking at her, “she’s wore out.All the work we had, she and me, getting in the woman to wash him and then laying him out and then the coffin and then arranging about the Mass in the chapel.Only for Father O’Rourke I don’t know what we’d done at all.It was him brought us all them flowers and them two candlesticks out of the chapel and wrote out the notice for the Freeman’s General and took charge of all the papers for the cemetery and poor James’s insurance.”"
"“那他这人不是很好吗？”姨妈说。","“Wasn’t that good of him?” said my aunt."
"伊丽莎闭上双眼，慢慢地摇了摇头。","Eliza closed her eyes and shook her head slowly."
"“唉，还是老朋友靠得住，”她说，“但是归根到底，一具尸首是谈不上信任什么朋友的。”","“Ah, there’s no friends like the old friends,” she said, “when all is said and done, no friends that a body can trust.”"
"“的确如此，这话不假。”姨妈说道，“不过我敢说，既然他已经去享用他那份永恒的奖赏，他不会忘记你们以及所有你们对他的好。”","“Indeed, that’s true,” said my aunt.“And I’m sure now that he’s gone to his eternal reward he won’t forget you and all your kindness to him.”"
"“啊，可怜的詹姆斯！”伊丽莎说道,“对我们来说他一直都不是大麻烦。他还在的时候，在房子里发出的动静也不会比现在更大。可是，我知道他不在了，而且永远去了那个……”","“Ah, poor James!” said Eliza.“He was no great trouble to us. You wouldn’t hear him in the house any more than now.Still, I know he’s gone and all to that....”"
"“只有一切结束的时候你们才会开始想他。”姨妈说。","“It’s when it’s all over that you’ll miss him,” said my aunt."
"“我明白。”伊丽莎说,“我再也不用把牛肉汁给他端进去，而您，夫人，也再不用送鼻烟给他了。唉，可怜的詹姆斯！”","“I know that,” said Eliza.“I won’t be bringing him in his cup of beef-tea any more, nor you, ma’am, sending him his snuff.Ah, poor James!”"
"她止住了话头，仿佛在沉湎于过去，然后又机敏地说道：","She stopped, as if she were communing with the past and then said shrewdly:"
"“您听我说，我注意到他在去世前就有些不对劲了。每次我端汤进去的时候，总是发现他的祈祷书掉在地上，人躺在椅子里，嘴巴张开着。”","“Mind you, I noticed there was something queer coming over him latterly.Whenever I’d bring in his soup to him there I’d find him with his breviary fallen to the floor, lying back in the chair and his mouth open.”"
"她把一个手指搁在鼻子上，皱起了眉头，然后接着说道：","She laid a finger against her nose and frowned: then she continued:"
"“不过就这样，他还老是说，夏天过完之前，他会挑个好天坐车再去看看爱尔兰区的那所老房子，带着我和南妮一起。我们都是在那里出生的。只要我们能弄到一辆那种新式马车——奥鲁尔克神父曾告诉过他那种车不会发出噪声，轮子转起来呼哧呼哧的——然后便宜地租用一天，他说，就从路那边的约翰尼·拉什店里弄来，在一个礼拜日的傍晚拉我们三个一块出去。他一门心思都在这件事上……可怜的詹姆斯！“","“But still and all he kept on saying that before the summer was over he’d go out for a drive one fine day just to see the old house again where we were all born down in Irishtown and take me and Nannie with him.If we could only get one of them new-fangled carriages that makes no noise that Father O’Rourke told him about, them with the rheumatic wheels, for the day cheap—he said, at Johnny Rush’s over the way there and drive out the three of us together of a Sunday evening.He had his mind set on that.... Poor James!”"
"“愿上帝宽恕他的灵魂！”姨妈说道。","“The Lord have mercy on his soul!” said my aunt."
"伊丽莎掏出手帕擦了擦眼睛。紧接着她又把手帕放回了口袋里，然后就盯着空荡荡的炉子一言不发地看了好一会儿。","Eliza took out her handkerchief and wiped her eyes with it.Then she put it back again in her pocket and gazed into the empty grate for some time without speaking."
"“他总是顾虑太多。”她说，“神父的职责对他来说是太重了。所以呢，他这一辈子，可以说，都是在受罪。”","“He was too scrupulous always,” she said.“The duties of the priesthood was too much for him.And then his life was, you might say, crossed.”"
"“是呀，”姨妈说，“他是个失意的人。这一点大家都能看出来。”","“Yes,” said my aunt.“He was a disappointed man.You could see that.”"
"沉默控制了这个小房间，在沉默的掩护下，我凑到桌子旁边尝了尝我的那份雪利酒，然后又静静地坐回到角落的椅子上。伊丽莎似乎已经深深地陷入了沉思。我们都满怀敬意地等着她来打破沉默：在一段漫长的停顿之后，她才缓缓地说道：","A silence took possession of the little room and, under cover of it, I approached the table and tasted my sherry and then returned quietly to my chair in the comer.Eliza seemed to have fallen into a deep revery.We waited respectfully for her to break the silence: and after a long pause she said slowly:"
"“他打碎了那只圣杯……那也是这一切的开始。当然，他们说那没什么，我的意思是，说那杯子里什么也没盛。不过仍然……他们说那是那个男孩的错。但可怜的詹姆斯却非常紧张，愿上帝可怜他！”","“It was that chalice he broke.... That was the beginning of it.Of course, they say it was all right, that it contained nothing, I mean.But still.... They say it was the boy’s fault.But poor James was so nervous, God be merciful to him!”"
"“真是这样吗？”姨妈问道，“我听说了……”","“And was that it?” said my aunt.“I heard something....”"
"伊丽莎点点头。","Eliza nodded."
"“那件事影响了他的心理，”她说，“在那之后他开始变得郁郁寡欢，不跟人说话，还一个人到处乱走。”就这样，一天晚上，他们想请他去做探访可却哪儿都找不着他。他们上找下找；可依旧是哪儿都看不见他的踪影。最后执事建议去礼拜堂找找看。于是他们拿上钥匙打开了礼拜堂的门，奥鲁尔克神父和当时在场的另一位神父还拿来了一盏灯以方便寻找他……然后他就在那里，独自坐在黑暗的忏悔室里，完全清醒着，好像在轻轻地对着自己发笑。发现他那副样子，你会怎么想？”她突然停了下来，仿佛要聆听什么。我也凝神倾听着，但屋子里没有任何声音。我知道老神父还像我们刚刚看到的那个样子一动不动地躺在棺材里，死了还显得庄严而气势逼人，一只空置的圣杯放在他的胸前。","“That affected his mind,” she said.“After that he began to mope by himself, talking to no one and wandering about by himself.So one night he was wanted for to go on a call and they couldn’t find him anywhere.They looked high up and low down; and still they couldn’t see a sight of him anywhere.So then the clerk suggested to try the chapel.So then they got the keys and opened the chapel and the clerk and Father O’Rourke and another priest that was there brought in a light for to look for him.... And what do you think but there he was, sitting up by himself in the dark in his confession-box, wide-awake and laughing-like softly to himself?”She stopped suddenly as if to listen.I too listened; but there was no sound in the house: and I knew that the old priest was lying still in his coffin as we had seen him, solemn and truculent in death, an idle chalice on his breast."
"伊丽莎接着说道：","Eliza resumed:"
"“他非常清醒，好像还在冲自个儿发笑……那么，当然，他们看见那情景，那情景让他们觉得他有什么地方不对劲了……”","“Wide-awake and laughing-like to himself.... So then, of course, when they saw that, that made them think that there was something gone wrong with him....”"

"是乔·狄龙把荒野西部介绍给我们的。他有一些由《联合杰克》、《勇气》和《半便士奇闻》的过期期刊组成的少许藏书。每天晚上放学之后，我们会在他家的后花园里碰头，玩印第安人的打仗游戏。他和他的胖弟弟利奥，那个懒人，会占据马厩的阁楼，而我们则通过强攻努力去夺取它；或者我们会在草地上玩对阵战。不过，无论我们玩得多卖力，我们从来都没有打赢过包围战或对阵战；所有的较量都是以乔·狄龙庆祝胜利的战争舞蹈收场。他的父母每天早上都会去加德纳街参加八点钟弥撒。狄龙太太身上那种平和的气息弥漫在房子的门厅里。可是对于我们这些比他年纪小、胆子也小的人来说，他却玩得过于拼命了。当他在花园里蹦来蹦去的时候，他看上去有点像是个印第安人，头上戴着一个茶壶保暖套，一只拳头敲打着一个锡铁罐，嘴里则喊叫着：","IT WAS Joe Dillon who introduced the Wild West to us.He had a little library made up of old numbers of The Union Jack, Pluck and The Halfpenny Marvel.Every evening after school we met in his back garden and arranged Indian battles.He and his fat young brother Leo, the idler, held the loft of the stable while we tried to carry it by storm; or we fought a pitched battle on the grass.But, however well we fought, we never won siege or battle and all our bouts ended with Joe Dillon’s war dance of victory.His parents went to eight-o’clock mass every morning in Gardiner Street and the peaceful odour of Mrs. Dillon was prevalent in the hall of the house.But he played too fiercely for us who were younger and more timid.He looked like some kind of an Indian when he capered round the garden, an old tea-cosy on his head, beating a tin with his fist and yelling:"
"“呀！呀咳，呀咳，呀咳！”据称他有心要当神父，大家都表示怀疑。不过这却是真的。","“Ya!yaka, yaka, yaka!”Everyone was incredulous when it was reported that he had a vocation for the priesthood.Nevertheless it was true."
"一种无法无天的精神在我们中间蔓延开来，在它的影响下，教养和体质的差异被完全忽视了。我们聚集成伙，有些人是为了显示自己的勇气，有些人是为了好玩，还有一些则几乎是出于害怕：最后这些人为数不少，他们害怕自己显得仿佛只会读书或者不够健壮，所以才勉勉强强地充当了印第安人，我就是其中的一员。文学作品中叙述的有关荒野西部的冒险故事离我的本性相距甚远，但至少，它们打开了逃避之门。我更喜欢读一些美国侦探小说，不时会有野性顽皮而又漂亮的女孩在沿路兜售。尽管这些小说里并没有什么不好的地方，而且它们的创作意图有时也很具有文学性，但在学校里它们却只能私下传阅。一天，当巴特勒神父在听我们诵读罗马历史的四页书时，发现了笨手笨脚的利奥·狄龙带着一本《半便士奇闻》。","A spirit of unruliness diffused itself among us and, under its influence, differences of culture and constitution were waived.We banded ourselves together, some boldly, some in jest and some almost in fear: and of the number of these latter, the reluctant Indians who were afraid to seem studious or lacking in robustness, I was one. The adventures related in the literature of the Wild West were remote from my nature but, at least, they opened doors of escape.I liked better some American detective stories which were traversed from time to time by unkempt fierce and beautiful girls.Though there was nothing wrong in these stories and though their intention was sometimes literary they were circulated secretly at school.One day when Father Butler was hearing the four pages of Roman History clumsy Leo Dillon was discovered with a copy of The Halfpenny Marvel."
"“这一页还是这一页？这一页？好了，狄龙，起来！‘那一天几乎还没有’……接着往下念！哪一天？‘那一天几乎还没有破晓’……你看过了没有？你口袋里装的是什么？”","“This page or this page?This page? Now, Dillon, up!‘Hardly had the day’... Go on!What day?‘Hardly had the day dawned’... Have you studied it?What have you there in your pocket?”"
"利奥·狄龙把那报纸交上去的时候，我们每个人都心惊肉跳，但每个人的脸上却又都装出一副无辜的样子。巴特勒神父翻了几页，皱起了眉头。","Everyone’s heart palpitated as Leo Dillon handed up the paper and everyone assumed an innocent face.Father Butler turned over the pages, frowning."
"“这是什么垃圾东西？”他说道，“阿帕奇酋长！这就是你不读你的《罗马史》而在看的东西？以后别让我在这所学校里再看到这种拙劣的东西。写这种东西的人，我想，一定是个该死的家伙，写这些玩意就是为了买酒喝。我很吃惊，像你们这样的男孩子，受过教育，还读这种东西。倘若你们是……国立学校的孩子，我倒还可以理解。听着，狄龙，我严正告诫你，好好用功，否则……”","“What is this rubbish?” he said.“The Apache Chief!Is this what you read instead of studying your Roman History?Let me not find any more of this wretched stuff in this college.The man who wrote it, I suppose, was some wretched fellow who writes these things for a drink.I’m surprised at boys like you, educated, reading such stuff.I could understand it if you were... National School boys.Now, Dillon, I advise you strongly, get at your work or...”"
"在上学期间清醒的时刻听来的这番训诫使荒野西部在我看来所具有的荣光黯淡了不少，利奥·狄龙那张惶惑无措的胖脸也唤醒了我的一片良知。但是当我远离学校的约束影响时，我又开始渴求不羁的感觉，渴求只有那些乱世纪事才能提供给我的逃避。傍晚时分的模拟战争游戏最后变得和上午学校的例行功课一样无聊乏味，因为我想要有真正的冒险故事发生在自己身上。但是真正的冒险故事，我想，是不会发生在老呆在家里的人身上的：必须得到外面的世界去寻找。","This rebuke during the sober hours of school paled much of the glory of the Wild West for me and the confused puffy face of Leo Dillon awakened one of my consciences.But when the restraining influence of the school was at a distance I began to hunger again for wild sensations, for the escape which those chronicles of disorder alone seemed to offer me.The mimic warfare of the evening became at last as wearisome to me as the routine of school in the morning because I wanted real adventures to happen to myself.But real adventures, I reflected, do not happen to people who remain at home: they must be sought abroad."
"暑假临近的时候，我下定决心至少有一天要打破学校生活的沉闷。和利奥·狄龙及一个名叫马奥尼的男孩一起，我制定了逃学一天的计划。我们每个人都攒了六便士。我们约好上午十点在运河桥上碰头。马奥尼的姐姐会给他写张事假条，而利奥·狄龙则会让他哥哥说他病了。我们计划沿着码头路往前走，一直走到有船的地方，然后坐渡轮过去，再走远些去看鸽棚。利奥·狄龙担心我们会碰上巴特勒神父或者学校里的什么人；而马奥尼则非常理智地反问说，巴特勒神父大老远地去鸽棚干什么。我们都放心了：然后我把他们两个的六便士收了上来，同时也给他们看了我自己的六便士，这样，这次阴谋的第一个阶段就告结束。在出发前夜做最后的安排时，我们都隐隐约约地感到有些激动。我们互相握手，大笑，马奥尼说：","The summer holidays were near at hand when I made up my mind to break out of the weariness of school-life for one day at least.With Leo Dillon and a boy named Mahony I planned a day’s miching.Each of us saved up sixpence.We were to meet at ten in the morning on the Canal Bridge.Mahony’s big sister was to write an excuse for him and Leo Dillon was to tell his brother to say he was sick.We arranged to go along the Wharf Road until we came to the ships, then to cross in the ferryboat and walk out to see the Pigeon House.Leo Dillon was afraid we might meet Father Butler or someone out of the college; but Mahony asked, very sensibly, what would Father Butler be doing out at the Pigeon House.We were reassured: and I brought the first stage of the plot to an end by collecting sixpence from the other two, at the same time showing them my own sixpence.When we were making the last arrangements on the eve we were all vaguely excited.We shook hands, laughing, and Mahony said:"
"“就等明天了，伙伴们！”","“Till tomorrow, mates!”"
"那天晚上我睡得很不好。早上我第一个来到桥上，因为我住得最近。我把书藏在了花园尽头灰窖旁边从来没什么人去的高草丛中，然后就匆匆沿着运河河岸走去。那是六月第一周里一个温和晴朗的早晨。我端坐在桥栏上，一边欣赏着自己头天晚上辛辛苦苦用白黏土涂白的磨坏了的灯芯绒鞋子，一边看着温顺的马儿拉着街车往山上爬，车上坐满了做生意的人。林荫路两边种着高高的树木，所有的树枝上都生意盎然地绽放着浅绿色的小叶，阳光透过这些枝叶斜射到水面上。大桥的花岗岩石面变得暖和起来，应和着脑子里想着的一种曲调，我开始用手轻拍起石面来。我非常快乐。","That night I slept badly.In the morning I was firstcomer to the bridge as I lived nearest.I hid my books in the long grass near the ashpit at the end of the garden where nobody ever came and hurried along the canal bank.It was a mild sunny morning in the first week of June.I sat up on the coping of the bridge admiring my frail canvas shoes which I had diligently pipeclayed overnight and watching the docile horses pulling a tramload of business people up the hill.All the branches of the tall trees which lined the mall were gay with little light green leaves and the sunlight slanted through them on to the water.The granite stone of the bridge was beginning to be warm and I began to pat it with my hands in time to an air in my head.I was very happy."
"坐了有五分钟或十分钟的时候，我看见马奥尼身穿灰色外套朝这边走来。他沿着小山走了上来，微笑着，然后攀上桥栏坐在了我的身边。我们等着的时候，他从鼓鼓囊囊的内揣口袋里掏出了弹弓，向我解释了他所做的一些改进。我问他为什么要带弹弓，他告诉我说他带它是为了和鸟儿们寻开心。马奥尼很随意地使用着俚语，把巴特勒神父说成是老邦瑟。我们又等了一刻钟，但仍然不见利奥·狄龙的影子。最后，马奥尼跳下来说：","When I had been sitting there for five or ten minutes I saw Mahony’s grey suit approaching.He came up the hill, smiling, and clambered up beside me on the bridge.While we were waiting he brought out the catapult which bulged from his inner pocket and explained some improvements which he had made in it.I asked him why he had brought it and he told me he had brought it to have some gas with the birds.Mahony used slang freely, and spoke of Father Butler as Old Bunser.We waited on for a quarter of an hour more but still there was no sign of Leo Dillon.Mahony, at last, jumped down and said:"
"“走吧。我早知道胖子会临阵脱逃。”“那他的六便士？”我说道。","“Come along.I knew Fatty’d funk it.”“And his sixpence...?” I said."
"“没收了，”马奥尼说，“这样对我们更好——有一先令六便士而不只是一先令。”","“That’s forfeit,” said Mahony.“And so much the better for us—a bob and a tanner instead of a bob.”"
"我们沿着北斯特兰德路一直走到矾油厂，然后向右拐到了码头路上。我们一走出公众的视线，马奥尼就开始扮起了印第安人。他追赶着一群衣衫褴褛的女孩们，手里挥舞着没装子弹的弹弓，当两个衣衫褴褛的男孩发扬骑士精神朝我们扔石块时，他又建议说我们应该向他们发起进攻。我反对说那两个男孩还太小，于是我们就继续往前走，而衣衫褴褛的那伙孩子则在我们身后尖叫着：“小屁孩！小屁孩！”。他们以为我们是新教徒，因为马奥尼肤色偏黑，他的帽子上还别着一个板球俱乐部的银色徽章。当我们来到熨平铁那个地方的时候，我们组织了一次围攻；不过没有玩成，因为至少得有三个人。我们就在利奥·狄龙身上发泄怨气，说他真是个胆小鬼，猜想着三点钟的时候他会从瑞安先生那里挨多少下打。","We walked along the North Strand Road till we came to the Vitriol Works and then turned to the right along the Wharf Road.Mahony began to play the Indian as soon as we were out of public sight.He chased a crowd of ragged girls, brandishing his unloaded catapult and, when two ragged boys began, out of chivalry, to fling stones at us, he proposed that we should charge them.I objected that the boys were too small and so we walked on, the ragged troop screaming after us: “Swaddlers! Swaddlers!”thinking that we were Protestants because Mahony, who was dark-complexioned, wore the silver badge of a cricket club in his cap.When we came to the Smoothing Iron we arranged a siege; but it was a failure because you must have at least three.We revenged ourselves on Leo Dillon by saying what a funk he was and guessing how many he would get at three o’clock from Mr. Ryan."
"然后我们来到了河边。我们在两边筑有高高石墙的嘈杂的街道上走了好一会儿，看着起重机和机车在运转，我们常常会站着不动，因而招来驾着吱扭作响大车的车夫们的喝斥。中午时分，我们走到了码头，似乎所有干活的人都在吃午饭，于是我们也买了两个大大的葡萄干面包，在河边的一根金属管道上坐下吃了起来。我们高兴地观赏着都柏林的商业景象——老远就能看见的喷着模糊烟圈的驳船，停靠在林森德那边的棕色渔船，和对面码头上正在卸货的白色大帆船。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　马奥尼说要是坐在那样的一艘大船上跑到海上去，那会非常有趣；看着那些高高的桅杆，我甚至看到了，或者说想象到了，在学校里一星半点学到的那点地理知识渐渐地在我的眼前变成了实实在在的东西。学校和家似乎在离我们越来越远，它们对我们的影响也似乎在减弱。","We came then near the river. We spent a long time walking about the noisy streets flanked by high stone walls, watching the working of cranes and engines and often being shouted at for our immobility by the drivers of groaning carts.It was noon when we reached the quays and as all the labourers seemed to be eating their lunches, we bought two big currant buns and sat down to eat them on some metal piping beside the river. We pleased ourselves with the spectacle of Dublin’s commerce—the barges signalled from far away by their curls of woolly smoke, the brown fishing fleet beyond Ringsend, the big white sailing-vessel which was being discharged on the opposite quay.Mahony said it would be right skit to run away to sea on one of those big ships and even I, looking at the high masts, saw, or imagined, the geography which had been scantily dosed to me at school gradually taking substance under my eyes.School and home seemed to recede from us and their influences upon us seemed to wane."
"我们付了船费，和两个工人还有一个随身带着个包的小个子犹太人一起坐船渡过了利菲河。我们都很严肃，几乎到了肃穆的地步。不过，在这短短的旅途中，有一次目光相遇的时候，我们俩都笑了起来。上了岸之后，我们就看着那艘姿态优雅的三桅帆船卸货，在对面码头的时候我们就曾经观察过它。一旁有个人说，这是艘挪威船。我走到船尾，想从船身上的图文中解读出点什么，但却没能成功，于是我又返回来仔细端详那些外国水手，看他们中有没有谁的眼睛是绿色的，因为我一直有某种模糊的概念……但是这些水手的眼睛有的是蓝色的，有的是灰色的，甚至还有的是黑色的。只有一名水手的眼睛可以称得上是绿色的，他是个高个子，码头上的人群都冲着他直乐，因为每次木板落下的时候，他总是高兴地大喊：","We crossed the Liffey in the ferryboat, paying our toll to be transported in the company of two labourers and a little Jew with a bag. We were serious to the point of solemnity, but once during the short voyage our eyes met and we laughed.When we landed we watched the discharging of the graceful threemaster which we had observed from the other quay.Some bystander said that she was a Norwegian vessel.I went to the stern and tried to decipher the legend upon it but, failing to do so, I came back and examined the foreign sailors to see had any of them green eyes for I had some confused notion.... The sailors’ eyes were blue and grey and even black.The only sailor whose eyes could have been called green was a tall man who amused the crowd on the quay by calling out cheerfully every time the planks fell:"
"“好了!好了！”当我们看够了这个场景之后，就慢慢蹓跶到了林森德。天气变得闷热起来，杂货店橱窗里放着颜色发白的发霉饼干。我们买了些饼干和巧克力，漫步走过渔民家庭居住的肮脏街道，小心翼翼地吃了一路。我们没能找到乳品店，于是就走进一家小卖铺，一人买了一瓶山莓柠檬汽水。喝完汽水又有了劲，马奥尼开始顺着一条巷子追赶一只猫，可那只猫却逃进了一片开阔的田地。我们都觉得非常累，走到那片田地，我们就立刻朝一处倾斜的坡岸走去，从岸脊上望过去可以看到多德河。","“All right!All right!”When we were tired of this sight we wandered slowly into Ringsend.The day had grown sultry, and in the windows of the grocers’ shops musty biscuits lay bleaching.We bought some biscuits and chocolate which we ate sedulously as we wandered through the squalid streets where the families of the fishermen live.We could find no dairy and so we went into a huckster’s shop and bought a bottle of raspberry lemonade each.Refreshed by this, Mahony chased a cat down a lane, but the cat escaped into a wide field.We both felt rather tired and when we reached the field we made at once for a sloping bank over the ridge of which we could see the Dodder."
"时间已晚，我们也都累得无法去实现参观鸽棚的计划了。我们必须得在四点钟之前回到家，以免我们的冒险被人发现。马奥尼失望地盯着他的弹弓，我则没等他重新打起精神就不得不提议坐火车回家。太阳钻到了一些云朵后面，我们俩萎靡不振，食物则仅剩残渣。","It was too late and we were too tired to carry out our project of visiting the Pigeon House.We had to be home before four o’clock lest our adventure should be discovered.Mahony looked regretfully at his catapult and I had to suggest going home by train before he regained any cheerfulness.The sun went in behind some clouds and left us to our jaded thoughts and the crumbs of our provisions."
"田地里除了我们再无别人。我们一言不发地在坡岸上躺了一会儿，然后我看见有个人远远地从田地的那一头走了过来。我一边懒洋洋地看着他，一边嚼着一些女孩子常用来算命的绿草杆儿。他沿着坡岸慢慢地走来。他走路时，一只手搭在胯部，另一只手里拿着一根棍子，轻轻地敲打着草皮。他衣着破旧，穿着一件黑绿色的外套，戴着一顶我们过去叫作马桶帽的帽子，帽顶很高。他似乎很老了，因为他的胡子已经灰白。当他从我们脚边经过的时候，他抬眼很快瞥了一下我们俩，然后又继续走他的路。我们用目光跟随着他，看到他往前走了大概五十步之后，然后转过身又开始往回走。他非常缓慢地朝我们走来，一边还是用他的棍子不断敲打着地面，他走得太慢了，慢得让我以为他是在草里寻找什么东西。","There was nobody but ourselves in the field.When we had lain on the bank for some time without speaking I saw a man approaching from the far end of the field.I watched him lazily as I chewed one of those green stems on which girls tell fortunes.He came along by the bank slowly.He walked with one hand upon his hip and in the other hand he held a stick with which he tapped the turf lightly.He was shabbily dressed in a suit of greenish-black and wore what we used to call a jerry hat with a high crown.He seemed to be fairly old for his moustache was ashen-grey.When he passed at our feet he glanced up at us quickly and then continued his way.We followed him with our eyes and saw that when he had gone on for perhaps fifty paces he turned about and began to retrace his steps.He walked towards us very slowly, always tapping the ground with his stick, so slowly that I thought he was looking for something in the grass."
"走到我们跟前的时候，他停了下来，向我们问日安。我们回应了他，他就慢慢地、非常小心地在我们身边的斜坡上坐了下来。他开始谈论天气，说今年夏天天气会很热，还说季节变化很大，相比他小时候而言——那是很久以前了。他说一个人一生中最幸福的时刻无疑是他的学生时代，他愿意以任何代价来换得再年轻一回。当他抒发这些让我们颇感厌烦的感想时，我们都保持沉默。然后他开始谈论起学校和书本来。他问我们是否读过托马斯·穆尔的诗歌或者沃尔特·司各脱和利顿勋爵的作品。我装出自己读过他提到的每一本书的样子，以至于最后他说道：","He stopped when he came level with us and bade us goodday.We answered him and he sat down beside us on the slope slowly and with great care.He began to talk of the weather, saying that it would be a very hot summer and adding that the seasons had changed greatly since he was a boy—a long time ago. He said that the happiest time of one’s life was undoubtedly one’s schoolboy days and that he would give anything to be young again.While he expressed these sentiments which bored us a little we kept silent.Then he began to talk of school and of books.He asked us whether we had read the poetry of Thomas Moore or the works of Sir Walter Scott and Lord Lytton.I pretended that I had read every book he mentioned so that in the end he said:"
"“啊，我看出来了，你和我一样也是个书虫。嗯，”他指着睁大眼睛注视着我们的马奥尼接着说道，“他就不一样了；他喜欢游戏。”","“Ah, I can see you are a bookworm like myself.Now, ” he added, pointing to Mahony who was regarding us with open eyes, “he is different; he goes in for games.”"
"他说他家里收藏有沃尔特·司各脱爵士的全部作品和利顿勋爵的全部作品，并且他读这些书从来就没有厌倦过。“当然了，”他说，“利顿勋爵的有些作品男孩子是不能读的。”马奥尼问为什么男孩子读不了——这个问题让我感到又不安又难受，因为我害怕这个人会以为我和马奥尼一样愚蠢。然而，那个人却只是笑了笑。我看见他嘴里的那些黄牙之间有很大的缝隙。然后他问我们俩谁的小情人最多。马奥尼轻松地提到他有三个女人。那个人又问我有几个。我回答说我一个都没有。他不相信我的话，并且说他敢确信我肯定有一个。我沉默无语。","He said he had all Sir Walter Scott’s works and all Lord Lytton’s works at home and never tired of reading them.“Of course,” he said, “there were some of Lord Lytton’s works which boys couldn’t read.” Mahony asked why couldn’t boys read them—a question which agitated and pained me because I was afraid the man would think I was as stupid as Mahony.The man, however, only smiled.I saw that he had great gaps in his mouth between his yellow teeth.Then he asked us which of us had the most sweethearts.Mahony mentioned lightly that he had three totties.The man asked me how many I had.I answered that I had none.He did not believe me and said he was sure I must have one.I was silent."
"“告诉我们，”马奥尼直白地冲那个人说道，“你自己有几个？”","“Tell us,” said Mahony pertly to the man, “how many have you yourself?”"
"那个人又像先前那样笑了笑，然后说像我们这么大的时候，他有过很多情人。","The man smiled as before and said that when he was our age he had lots of sweethearts."
"“每个男孩，”他说，“都有一个小情人。”","“Every boy,” he said, “has a little sweetheart.”"
"他在这个问题上的态度让我觉得对于他那个年龄的人来说有些出乎寻常的开放。从我本心讲，我认为他所说的关于男孩和情人的事是有道理的。可我不喜欢他嘴里说出的词，而且我很纳闷他为什么哆嗦了一两次，仿佛他害怕什么或者突然感觉到了寒冷似的。他接着往下讲的时候，我注意到他的口音还是很纯正的。他开始跟我们谈论起女孩们的事情来，说她们有怎样柔美的发丝，她们的双手是如何的柔软，以及但凡一个人有所了解就会知道所有的女孩其实并没有她们看起来那么好。他说，没有什么比盯着一个漂亮姑娘看——看她那好看白皙的双手，看她那柔滑秀美的头发——更让他喜欢的事情了。他给我的印象的是他正在复述他已经记诵在心的东西或者说受他自己谈话中的某些语句的吸引，他的思绪正慢慢地沿着同一个轨道开始不停地绕起圈来。有时，他说话的样子仿佛他只是在谈论尽人皆知的某个事实，而有时，他又压低嗓音，神秘兮兮地说话，仿佛他在告诉我们一件秘密的事情，不希望别人偷听到。他重复着他的话语，一遍又一遍，变换着不同的表述方式，包裹在他那单调的嗓音中。我一边继续凝视着坡脚，一边听着他说。","His attitude on this point struck me as strangely liberal in a man of his age. In my heart I thought that what he said about boys and sweethearts was reasonable.But I disliked the words in his mouth and I wondered why he shivered once or twice as if he feared something or felt a sudden chill.As he proceeded I noticed that his accent was good.He began to speak to us about girls, saying what nice soft hair they had and how soft their hands were and how all girls were not so good as they seemed to be if one only knew.There was nothing he liked, he said, so much as looking at a nice young girl, at her nice white hands and her beautiful soft hair.He gave me the impression that he was repeating something which he had learned by heart or that, magnetised by some words of his own speech, his mind was slowly circling round and round in the same orbit.At times he spoke as if he were simply alluding to some fact that everybody knew, and at times he lowered his voice and spoke mysteriously as if he were telling us something secret which he did not wish others to overhear.He repeated his phrases over and over again, varying them and surrounding them with his monotonous voice.I continued to gaze towards the foot of the slope, listening to him."
"过了好一会儿，他的独白停止了。他缓慢地站起身来，说他得离开我们一会儿，就几分钟，而我在没有改变凝视方向的情况下看见他慢慢离开我们朝离我们较近的地头走去。当他走开以后，我们都沉默不语。几分钟的沉默之后，我听到马奥尼叫了起来：","After a long while his monologue paused.He stood up slowly, saying that he had to leave us for a minute or so, a few minutes, and, without changing the direction of my gaze, I saw him walking slowly away from us towards the near end of the field.We remained silent when he had gone.After a silence of a few minutes I heard Mahony exclaim:"
"“我说！快看他在做什么！”因为我既没有应答也没有抬眼去看，马奥尼又叫了起来：","“I say!Look what he’s doing!”As I neither answered nor raised my eyes Mahony exclaimed again:"
"“我说……他真是个古怪的老家伙！”","“I say... He’s a queer old josser!”"
"“万一他问起我们的名字，”我说道，“那你就叫墨菲，我叫史密斯。”","“In case he asks us for our names,” I said “let you be Murphy and I’ll be Smith.”"
"我们彼此没有再说什么。我还在考虑要不要走开的时候那个人就回来了，他又在我们身边坐了下来。而他刚一坐下，马奥尼就看见了那只逃跑了的猫，他纵身跃起，越过田地追了上去。那个人和我则看着他追。那只猫再一次逃脱了，马奥尼开始朝着猫爬上去的那堵墙扔石头。等到不扔石块了，他就开始远远地在田地的那一头漫无目的地蹓跶起来。","We said nothing further to each other.I was still considering whether I would go away or not when the man came back and sat down beside us again.Hardly had he sat down when Mahony, catching sight of the cat which had escaped him, sprang up and pursued her across the field.The man and I watched the chase.The cat escaped once more and Mahony began to throw stones at the wall she had escaladed.Desisting from this, he began to wander about the far end of the field, aimlessly."
"过了一会儿，那个人开始对我说起话来。他说我的朋友是一个非常顽皮的男孩，并且问我他在学校里是不是常常挨鞭子。我很想愤怒地反驳说我们不是国立学校的男生，不会像他说的那样挨鞭子，不过我最终还是保持着沉默。他开始谈论起体罚学生的话题。他的思绪，仿佛再次被自己的话语所吸引，似乎绕着新的中心开始慢慢地转起圈来。他说男孩子要是那种样子他们就应该挨打，而且应该是好好地挨一顿打。一个男孩要是又顽皮又难管教的话，没有什么能对他有好处，只能是结结实实地打一顿。打手掌或扇耳光都不管用：他需要的就是好好地挨一顿鞭打，直到打得浑身发热。我对这种论调感到吃惊，不由自主地抬眼去看他的脸。我这样做的时候，他那蹙起的额头下露出的一双墨绿色的眼睛也正在凝视着我。我又移开了自己的目光。","After an interval the man spoke to me.He said that my friend was a very rough boy and asked did he get whipped often at school.I was going to reply indignantly that we were not National School boys to be whipped, as he called it; but I remained silent.He began to speak on the subject of chastising boys.His mind, as if magnetised again by his speech, seemed to circle slowly round and round its new centre.He said that when boys were that kind they ought to be whipped and well whipped.When a boy was rough and unruly there was nothing would do him any good but a good sound whipping.A slap on the hand or a box on the ear was no good: what he wanted was to get a nice warm whipping.I was surprised at this sentiment and involuntarily glanced up at his face.As I did so I met the gaze of a pair of bottle-green eyes peering at me from under a twitching forehead.I turned my eyes away again."
"那个人继续着他的独白。他似乎已经忘记了自己刚才那种开明的态度。他说要是他发现一个男孩跟女孩们说话或者有个女孩作情人，他会揍他一顿，好好地揍他一顿；那样就会教他记住不要随便和女孩们说话。要是一个男孩有个女孩作情人但却对此事撒谎的话，他会抽他一顿鞭子，一顿世界上任何男孩都没挨过的鞭子。他说世界上再没有什么事能让他如此喜欢的了。他向我描述他会怎样鞭打这样一个男孩，仿佛是在揭示某个复杂的秘密。他愿意那么做，他说，胜过世界上的任何事情；他的嗓音，在单调乏味地引导我感受这个秘密的过程中，渐渐变得几乎充满了爱意，似乎在恳求我应该要理解他。","The man continued his monologue.He seemed to have forgotten his recent liberalism.He said that if ever he found a boy talking to girls or having a girl for a sweetheart he would whip him and whip him; and that would teach him not to be talking to girls.And if a boy had a girl for a sweetheart and told lies about it then he would give him such a whipping as no boy ever got in this world.He said that there was nothing in this world he would like so well as that.He described to me how he would whip such a boy as if he were unfolding some elaborate mystery.He would love that, he said, better than anything in this world; and his voice, as he led me monotonously through the mystery, grew almost affectionate and seemed to plead with me that I should understand him."
"我等待着，直到他的独白再次停止。然后我迅速站起身来。担心会暴露自己的烦躁不安，我耽搁了片刻，假装整理了一下我的鞋子，然后说我必须得走了，就跟他道日安告别了。我镇静地爬上坡岸，但心却跳得很快，害怕他会抓住我的脚脖子。爬到坡顶之后，我转过身来，不去看他，朝田地的那头大声叫了起来：","I waited till his monologue paused again.Then I stood up abruptly.Lest I should betray my agitation I delayed a few moments pretending to fix my shoe properly and then, saying that I was obliged to go, I bade him good-day.I went up the slope calmly but my heart was beating quickly with fear that he would seize me by the ankles.When I reached the top of the slope I turned round and, without looking at him, called loudly across the field:"
"“墨菲！”","“Murphy!”"
"我的声音中有一种强装勇敢的腔调，我为自己的卑鄙伎俩感到羞愧。我不得不又喊了一次那个名字马奥尼才看见我，然后吆喝着作了应答。当他越过田地朝我跑来的时候，我的心跳得可真是快啊！他跑过来，俨然是来拯救我。而我却很是懊悔；因为在我心目中一直以来都有点看不起他。","My voice had an accent of forced bravery in it and I was ashamed of my paltry stratagem.I had to call the name again before Mahony saw me and hallooed in answer.How my heart beat as he came running across the field to me!He ran as if to bring me aid.And I was penitent; for in my heart I had always despised him a little."
"第三章 阿拉比","CHAPTER 3 ARABY"
"里士满北街是条死胡同，街面很安静，只有在基督教兄弟学校的男孩们放学的时候除外。一栋无人居住的二层楼房坐落在胡同尽头，与其他矗立在一片方形地块上的邻舍房屋相分离。这条街上的其他房舍都很清楚屋内主人的体面生活，它们互相凝视着对方，个个都是一副沉着冷静的棕色面孔。","NORTH RICHMOND STREET being blind, was a quiet street except at the hour when the Christian Brothers’ School set the boys free.An uninhabited house of two storeys stood at the blind end, detached from its neighbours in a square ground. The other houses of the street, conscious of decent lives within them, gazed at one another with brown imperturbable faces."
"我们这栋房子从前的租客是一位神父，他已经去世，死在了后面的起居室里。由于封闭已久，空气变得充满霉味，凝滞在所有的房间里；厨房后面那间弃置不用的房间丢满了没用的旧纸张。在这些废弃物中间，我发现了几本平装书，页角已经卷起，页面也都很潮湿：沃尔特·司各脱的《修道院院长》，《虔诚的教友》，还有《维多契回忆录》。我最喜欢最后这一本，因为它的书页是黄色的。房子后面的荒园中央长有一棵苹果树，还有一些恣意蔓生的灌木；在其中一丛灌木下，我发现了已故租客用过的生了锈的自行车打气筒。他曾经是一位非常仁慈的神父；在他的遗嘱里，他把所有的钱都留给了慈善机构，把房子里的家具留给了他的妹妹。","The former tenant of our house, a priest, had died in the back drawing-room.Air, musty from having been long enclosed, hung in all the rooms, and the waste room behind the kitchen was littered with old useless papers.Among these I found a few paper-covered books, the pages of which were curled and damp: The Abbot, by Walter Scott, The Devout Communicant and The Memoirs of Vidocq.I liked the last best because its leaves were yellow.The wild garden behind the house contained a central apple-tree and a few straggling bushes under one of which I found the late tenant’s rusty bicycle-pump.He had been a very charitable priest; in his will he had left all his money to institutions and the furniture of his house to his sister."
"当冬天白昼变短的时候，我们还没有吃完晚饭夜幕便开始降临。当我们在街上碰面时，房屋已经变得肃穆起来。我们头顶的天空呈现出变化多端的紫罗兰色；冲着这片天空，街灯举着它们微弱的灯火。寒冷的空气刺痛了我们，我们玩耍起来，直到身体发热变暖。我们的叫喊声回荡在寂静的街道上。游戏中，我们会先穿过房子后面那些黑暗泥泞的小巷，在那里我们会遭遇来自棚屋区的那帮野孩子的攻击，然后我们来到滴着水的黑暗的园子后门，那里的灰坑散发出难闻的味道，最后到达黑暗难闻的马厩，那里的一个马夫有时在抚摸梳理着马毛，有时在把扣好的马具摆弄得发出悦耳的声响。我们回到街上的时候，厨房窗户里透出的灯光已经洒满了这片地方。如果看见我姨父从街角走过来，我们会躲在阴影里，一直看他确实走进房子里才敢出来。或者如果曼根的姐姐出来站在门阶上喊她的弟弟回家喝茶，我们会从阴影里看着她朝街上四下张望。我们等着看她是会呆在那里还是会回到屋里。如果她呆在那里，我们就会从阴影里走出来，然后乖乖地走上曼根家的台阶。她在等着我们，半开的门里透出的灯光勾勒出了她的身形。她的弟弟总会捉弄她一下才肯听她的话，我则站在栏杆旁边盯着她看。她挪动身体的时候，她的连衣裙会摆来摆去，她那根柔软的发辫也会随着来回摆动。","When the short days of winter came dusk fell before we had well eaten our dinners.When we met in the street the houses had grown sombre.The space of sky above us was the colour of ever-changing violet and towards it the lamps of the street lifted their feeble lanterns.The cold air stung us and we played till our bodies glowed.Our shouts echoed in the silent street.The career of our play brought us through the dark muddy lanes behind the houses where we ran the gauntlet of the rough tribes from the cottages, to the back doors of the dark dripping gardens where odours arose from the ashpits, to the dark odorous stables where a coachman smoothed and combed the horse or shook music from the buckled harness.When we returned to the street light from the kitchen windows had filled the areas.If my uncle was seen turning the corner we hid in the shadow until we had seen him safely housed.Or if Mangan’s sister came out on the doorstep to call her brother in to his tea we watched her from our shadow peer up and down the street.We waited to see whether she would remain or go in and, if she remained, we left our shadow and walked up to Mangan’s steps resignedly.She was waiting for us, her figure defined by the light from the half-opened door.Her brother always teased her before he obeyed and I stood by the railings looking at her.Her dress swung as she moved her body and the soft rope of her hair tossed from side to side."
"每天早上，我都会躺在前厅的地板上注视着她的家门。百叶窗拉了下来，离窗框不到一英寸，因此没有人能看到我。当她从房里走到门阶上时，我的心就会怦怦直跳。我跑到客厅，抓起书本，然后跟在她的身后。我一直让她那棕色的身影保持在我的视线之内，当快走到我们的路线分岔的地方时，我就会加快步伐超过她。这种情形总是在早上重复上演。除了随便聊过几句，我从来没有和她说过话，然而她的名字却像是一道不可抗拒的命令，会唤起我所有愚蠢的激情。","Every morning I lay on the floor in the front parlour watching her door.The blind was pulled down to within an inch of the sash so that I could not be seen.When she came out on the doorstep my heart leaped.I ran to the hall, seized my books and followed her.I kept her brown figure always in my eye and, when we came near the point at which our ways diverged, I quickened my pace and passed her.This happened morning after morning.I had never spoken to her, except for a few casual words, and yet her name was like a summons to all my foolish blood."
"她的形象在我身边萦绕不散，甚至最不浪漫的场合也是如此。每逢星期六晚上姨妈去市场买东西的时候，我都得跟着去替她拿包。我们在灯火通明的街道穿行，被醉汉和讨价还价的妇人们挤来挤去，周围充斥着工人们的咒骂声、肉店伙计们尖锐持续的叫卖声（他们立守在一桶桶的猪头旁边）以及街头卖唱艺人带着鼻音的哼唱声（他们或是唱着关于奥多诺万·罗萨的一首《大家都来吧》的曲子，或是唱着一首关于我们的祖国所遭受苦难的歌谣）。这些嘈杂声对我而言只汇成了一种生命感受：我想象着自己捧着圣杯安然无恙地从一大群敌人中间走过。念古怪的祈祷词和赞颂词的时候，我的嘴巴里总是蹦出她的名字，而我自己都不理解这些祈祷词和赞美词的意思。我的眼睛常常噙满泪水（我无法说清楚原因），有时，心中涌起的一种激情似乎想要喷薄而出，填满我的胸膛。我很少想到未来。我不知道我是否会和她说话，或者说，如果我要和她说话，我该如何告诉她我这种迷茫的爱恋。但是我的身体就像是一架竖琴，她的言谈和举止则像是划过那琴弦的手指。","Her image accompanied me even in places the most hostile to romance.On Saturday evenings when my aunt went marketing I had to go to carry some of the parcels.We walked through the flaring streets, jostled by drunken men and bargaining women, amid the curses of labourers, the shrill litanies of shop-boys who stood on guard by the barrels of pigs’ cheeks, the nasal chanting of street-singers, who sang a come-all-you about O’Donovan Rossa, or a ballad about the troubles in our native land.These noises converged in a single sensation of life for me: I imagined that I bore my chalice safely through a throng of foes.Her name sprang to my lips at moments in strange prayers and praises which I myself did not understand.My eyes were often full of tears (I could not tell why) and at times a flood from my heart seemed to pour itself out into my bosom.I thought little of the future.I did not know whether I would ever speak to her or not or, if I spoke to her, how I could tell her of my confused adoration.But my body was like a harp and her words and gestures were like fingers running upon the wires."
"一天晚上，我走进了神父去世的那间起居室。那是一个昏黑的雨夜，房子里悄无声息。透过一块破了的窗玻璃，我听到了雨水敲打大地的声音，雨水就像细密连续的针脚，穿梭在雨水浸透的地床上。远处的某盏灯火或者某个亮灯的窗户在我的下方闪动。我很庆幸我能看到的只有这么多。我所有的感觉似乎都急欲要把它们自己遮掩起来，我感到自己马上就要从它们身边溜走，于是我把双手紧紧合十直到颤抖，嘴里轻声低语着：“哦，爱人！哦，爱人！”重复了许多次。终于，她和我说话了。当她开始跟我说话时，我一时慌乱竟不知道该怎么来应答。她问我要去阿拉比吗。我忘了自己回答的是去还是不去。那是个非常好的集市，她说她很想去。","One evening I went into the back drawing-room in which the priest had died.It was a dark rainy evening and there was no sound in the house.Through one of the broken panes I heard the rain impinge upon the earth, the fine incessant needles of water playing in the sodden beds.Some distant lamp or lighted window gleamed below me. I was thankful that I could see so little.All my senses seemed to desire to veil themselves and, feeling that I was about to slip from them, I pressed the palms of my hands together until they trembled, murmuring: “O love! O love!” many times.At last she spoke to me.When she addressed the first words to me I was so confused that I did not know what to answer.She asked me was I going to Araby.I forgot whether I answered yes or no. It would be a splendid bazaar, she said she would love to go."
"“那你为什么不能去呢？”我问道。","“And why can’t you?” I asked."
"她一边讲话，一边不停地转动着手腕上的一只银手镯。她不能去，她说，因为那个星期她所在的修道院会有一次静修活动。她的弟弟和另外两个男孩正在争抢帽子，我一个人在栏杆旁边。她抓着栏杆上的一个尖铁，头朝我的方向低着。我们房门对面的灯光映照出她脖颈白皙的曲线，照亮了散落在那里的发丝，接着往下，又照亮了栏杆上的那只手。灯光落在她衣裙的一侧，映照出了里面一个衬裙的白边，因为她以稍息姿势站在那里，刚好能够看得见。","While she spoke she turned a silver bracelet round and round her wrist.She could not go, she said, because there would be a retreat that week in her convent.Her brother and two other boys were fighting for their caps and I was alone at the railings.She held one of the spikes, bowing her head towards me. The light from the lamp opposite our door caught the white curve of her neck, lit up her hair that rested there and, falling, lit up the hand upon the railing.It fell over one side of her dress and caught the white border of a petticoat, just visible as she stood at ease."
"“对你来说情况就很不错。”她说。","“It’s well for you,” she said."
"“我要去的话，”我说，“我会给你带点东西回来。”","“If I go,” I said, “I will bring you something.”"
"那天晚上之后，有多少个愚蠢的念头使我弃置了清醒时和睡眠时的所有其他想法！我幻想着能把中间那些令人生厌的日子抹掉。我焦躁地应付着学校的功课。晚上在卧室，白天在教室，她的形象总会出现在我和我尽力去读的书页之间。我的灵魂在一片静默中纵情享乐，“阿拉比”这个词的音节穿过这片静默，在我的耳畔回响着，把一种东方魔力施加在我的全身。我请假说要在星期六晚上去那个集市。姨妈很吃惊，并希望那不是共济会成员搞的那一套。我在课上几乎不回答什么问题。我看着老师的脸色从和蔼变成了严厉；他希望我没有在虚度时光。我无法把漫游的思绪集中起来。我几乎没有什么耐心去面对生活这桩严肃的差事；既然它挡在了我和我的欲望之间，那么对我来说，它就似乎只是儿戏，鄙陋单调的儿戏。","What innumerable follies laid waste my waking and sleeping thoughts after that evening!I wished to annihilate the tedious intervening days.I chafed against the work of school.At night in my bedroom and by day in the classroom her image came between me and the page I strove to read.The syllables of the word Araby were called to me through the silence in which my soul luxuriated and cast an Eastern enchantment over me.I asked for leave to go to the bazaar on Saturday night.My aunt was surprised and hoped it was not some Freemason affair.I answered few questions in class.I watched my master’s face pass from amiability to sternness; he hoped I was not beginning to idle.I could not call my wandering thoughts together.I had hardly any patience with the serious work of life which, now that it stood between me and my desire, seemed to me child’s play, ugly monotonous child’s play."
"星期六早上，我提醒姨父说我晚上想去集市。他正在门厅衣帽架那里翻找帽刷，所以很简短地应答道：","On Saturday morning I reminded my uncle that I wished to go to the bazaar in the evening.He was fussing at the hallstand, looking for the hat-brush, and answered me curtly:"
"“好了，孩子，我知道了。”","“Yes, boy, I know.”"
"因为他在客厅，所以我无法到前厅去躺在窗边。我带着糟糕的心情离开了家，慢慢地朝学校走去。空气异常阴冷，我的心开始不安起来。","As he was in the hall I could not go into the front parlour and lie at the window.I left the house in bad humour and walked slowly towards the school.The air was pitilessly raw and already my heart misgave me."
"我回家吃晚饭的时候，姨父还没到家。不过时间还早。我坐着凝视了一会儿钟表，当表的滴答声开始让我心烦的时候，我离开了房间。我爬上楼梯，来到了房子的上面一层。那些又高又冷、空荡阴暗的房间一下子解放了我，我唱着歌从一个房间走到了另一个房间。从前面的窗户望出去，我看见伙伴们正在下面的街道上玩耍。他们的叫喊声传到我这里的时候变得微弱不清；我把额头抵在冷冰冰的玻璃上，朝她所居住的那座昏暗的房子望过去。我大概在那里站了有一个小时，看见的只有自己想象中勾画出来的那个身穿棕色衣裙的身影，被灯光小心地触碰着的那弯弯的脖颈，那搭在栏杆上的手，还有那衣裙下面的镶边。","When I came home to dinner my uncle had not yet been home.Still it was early.I sat staring at the clock for some time and when its ticking began to irritate me, I left the room.I mounted the staircase and gained the upper part of the house.The high cold empty gloomy rooms liberated me and I went from room to room singing.From the front window I saw my companions playing below in the street.Their cries reached me weakened and indistinct and, leaning my forehead against the cool glass, I looked over at the dark house where she lived.I may have stood there for an hour, seeing nothing but the brown-clad figure cast by my imagination, touched discreetly by the lamplight at the curved neck, at the hand upon the railings and at the border below the dress."
"我又到楼下的时候，看见默瑟太太坐在炉火边。她是个饶舌的老妇人，一个当铺老板的寡妇，为了某种虔诚的目的而收集那些用过的邮票。我不得不忍受茶桌边的闲言碎语。那顿饭拖延着吃了一个多小时，但姨父还没有回来。默瑟太太起身要走：她抱歉说她不能再等了，时间已过了八点，她不愿意很晚了还在外面呆着，因为夜间的空气不利于她的健康。她走了之后，我开始在屋子里走来走去，双手紧握成拳头。姨妈说：","When I came downstairs again I found Mrs. Mercer sitting at the fire.She was an old garrulous woman, a pawnbroker’s widow, who collected used stamps for some pious purpose.I had to endure the gossip of the tea-table.The meal was prolonged beyond an hour and still my uncle did not come.Mrs. Mercer stood up to go: she was sorry she couldn’t wait any longer, but it was after eight o’clock and she did not like to be out late as the night air was bad for her.When she had gone I began to walk up and down the room, clenching my fists.My aunt said:"
"“恐怕今天晚上你去不了集市了。”","“I’m afraid you may put off your bazaar for this night of Our Lord.”"
"九点钟的时候，我听到了姨父用钥匙开门的声音。我听到他自言自语，听到他那厚重的大衣挂在衣帽架上时衣帽架晃动的声音。我能够领会这些迹象的含义。当他晚饭吃了一半的时候，我问他要钱好去集市。他早忘了。","At nine o’clock I heard my uncle’s latchkey in the halldoor.I heard him talking to himself and heard the hallstand rocking when it had received the weight of his overcoat.I could interpret these signs.When he was midway through his dinner I asked him to give me the money to go to the bazaar.He had forgotten."
"“这会儿人们都上床睡醒一觉了。”他说。","“The people are in bed and after their first sleep now,” he said."
"我没有笑。姨妈激愤地冲他说道：","I did not smile.My aunt said to him energetically:"
"“难道你就不能给他钱让他去吗？你已经把他耽搁得够晚了。”姨父说他很抱歉他全忘了。他说他相信那句老话：“只学不耍，杰克变傻”。他问我要去哪里，我又告了他一遍，然后他问我是否知道《阿拉伯人告别坐骑》。当我离开厨房的时候，他正开始要给姨妈朗诵那首诗的开头几行。","“Can’t you give him the money and let him go?You’ve kept him late enough as it is.”My uncle said he was very sorry he had forgotten.He said he believed in the old saying: “All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.” He asked me where I was going and, when I had told him a second time he asked me did I know The Arab’s Farewell to his Steed.When I left the kitchen he was about to recite the opening lines of the piece to my aunt."
"我把一弗罗林紧紧攥在手里，沿着白金汉街大步朝车站走去。挤满了购物者和闪烁着耀眼汽灯的街道提醒着我此次旅行的目的。我在一趟乘客稀少的列车的三等车厢里找到了自己的座位。经过了一段令人难熬的耽搁之后，列车缓缓地驶出了车站。它向前爬行着，穿过破败不堪的房屋，越过波光粼粼的河流。在韦斯特兰·罗车站，一大群人挤向车厢门口；但列车员却让他们退后，说这是一趟开往集市的专门列车。我依然独自呆在空荡荡的车厢里。几分钟之后，列车缓缓停靠在了一个临时搭建的木站台旁边。我走出车厢来到路上，看见一座时钟那被照亮的钟盘上显示的时间是差十分十点钟。在我的面前是一幢大楼，显示着那个具有魔力的名字。","I held a florin tightly in my hand as I strode down Buckingham Street towards the station.The sight of the streets thronged with buyers and glaring with gas recalled to me the purpose of my journey.I took my seat in a third-class carriage of a deserted train.After an intolerable delay the train moved out of the station slowly.It crept onward among ruinous house and over the twinkling river.At Westland Row Station a crowd of people pressed to the carriage doors; but the porters moved them back, saying that it was a special train for the bazaar.I remained alone in the bare carriage.In a few minutes the train drew up beside an improvised wooden platform.I passed out on to the road and saw by the lighted dial of a clock that it was ten minutes to ten.In front of me was a large building which displayed the magical name."
"我找不到出售六便士门票的入口，由于担心集市会关门，我便迅速穿过一个旋转栅门，把一先令递给了一个满脸倦容的人。我发现自己置身于一个大厅，它的半高处围有一圈货廊。几乎所有的摊位都关了，大厅的大部分区域都处于黑暗之中。我感受到了有如仪式之后弥漫在教堂中的那种静默。我胆怯地走入集市中央。几个人正聚集在那些依旧在营业的摊位前。在一个装饰有彩灯拼成的“迷人咖啡屋”字样的帘子前面，两个男人正在一个浅盘上数钱。我听到了那些硬币掉落的声音。","I could not find any sixpenny entrance and, fearing that the bazaar would be closed, I passed in quickly through a turnstile, handing a shilling to a weary-looking man.I found myself in a big hall girdled at half its height by a gallery.Nearly all the stalls were closed and the greater part of the hall was in darkness.I recognised a silence like that which pervades a church after a service.I walked into the centre of the bazaar timidly.A few people were gathered about the stalls which were still open.Before a curtain, over which the words Cafe Chantant were written in coloured lamps, two men were counting money on a salver.I listened to the fall of the coins."
"我费了些劲才想起来这儿的原因，于是我走到一个摊位前，仔细看那些陶瓷花瓶和绘有花卉图案的茶具。在摊位门口，一位年轻女士正在和两个年轻绅士谈笑。我听出了他们的英格兰口音，然后模模糊糊地听起他们的谈话来。","Remembering with difficulty why I had come I went over to one of the stalls and examined porcelain vases and flowered tea-sets.At the door of the stall a young lady was talking and laughing with two young gentlemen.I remarked their English accents and listened vaguely to their conversation."
"“哦，我从来没有说过那样的话！”","“O, I never said such a thing!”"
"“哦，但是你的确说了！”","“O, but you did!”"
"“哦，但是我没有！”","“O, but I didn’t!”"
"“难道她没说过吗？”","“Didn’t she say that?”"
"“说过。我听见她说过。”“哦，这是……扯谎！”","“Yes.I heard her.”“O, there’s a... fib!”"
"那位年轻女士注意到了我，走过来问我是否想买什么东西。可她说话的语调并不希望我如此；她似乎只是出于一种责任感才和我说话。我谦卑地看着那个摊位光线昏暗的门口两边仿佛东方卫兵一样立着的大坛子，嘟哝道：","Observing me the young lady came over and asked me did I wish to buy anything.The tone of her voice was not encouraging; she seemed to have spoken to me out of a sense of duty.I looked humbly at the great jars that stood like eastern guards at either side of the dark entrance to the stall and murmured:"
"“不了，谢谢你。”","“No, thank you.”"
"那位年轻女士挪动了一下一个花瓶的位置，然后又回到了那两个年轻男人身边。他们又开始谈论同一个话题。有一两回，那位年轻女士回过头来朝我瞅了瞅。","The young lady changed the position of one of the vases and went back to the two young men.They began to talk of the same subject.Once or twice the young lady glanced at me over her shoulder."
"我在她的摊位前逗留着（尽管我知道我呆在那里毫无用处），极力让自己对她店里商品的兴趣显得更加真实些。然后我慢慢转身离开，在集市中央走着。我任凭两个便士的硬币同六便士硬币在口袋里撞击着。我听到有个声音在货廊的一角喊了一声灭灯了。大厅上面的那部分现在完全陷入了黑暗。","I lingered before her stall, though I knew my stay was useless, to make my interest in her wares seem the more real.Then I turned away slowly and walked down the middle of the bazaar.I allowed the two pennies to fall against the sixpence in my pocket.I heard a voice call from one end of the gallery that the light was out.The upper part of the hall was now completely dark."
"抬头凝视着那片黑暗，我觉得自己就是一个被虚荣驱使和愚弄的生物；我的双眼由于痛苦和愤怒而燃烧了起来。","Gazing up into the darkness I saw myself as a creature driven and derided by vanity; and my eyes burned with anguish and anger."
"第四章 伊夫琳","CHAPTER 4 EVELINE"
"她坐在窗边，注视着夜色渐渐侵噬了大街。她的头斜靠在窗帘上，鼻孔里充斥着布满灰尘的印花棉布的气味。她累了。","SHE sat at the window watching the evening invade the avenue.Her head was leaned against the window curtains and in her nostrils was the odour of dusty cretonne.She was tired."
"很少有人经过。从最后那栋房子里出来的那个男人在回家的路上由此经过；她听到他的脚步声先是沿着水泥路面咔嗒咔嗒作响，然后又在那片新建的红房子前面的煤渣路上嘎吱嘎吱作响。从前那儿有一片场地，每天晚上他们都会在那里和其他人家的孩子们一起玩耍。后来，一个来自贝尔法斯特的人买下了那片地，在上面盖了些房子——不是他们那种褐色的小房子而是屋顶闪闪发光、颜色鲜亮的砖房。街上的孩子们过去常常在那片空地玩耍——迪瓦恩家的、沃特家的、邓恩家的、小瘸子基奥、她以及她的兄弟姐妹们。但欧内斯特却从来不玩：他太大了。她的父亲常常用他那根黑刺李树干做的手杖把他们从那片空地轰出去；不过通常小基奥会给他们望风，一旦看见她父亲来了就会大声喊叫。尽管如此，他们那时似乎还是非常快乐。她的父亲那时还不算太坏；而且她的母亲也还活着。那是很久以前了；她和她的兄弟姐妹都已长大，她的母亲已经去世。蒂奇·邓恩也死了，沃特一家则已经搬回了英格兰。一切都变了。如今，她也要走了，像其他人一样离开自己的家。","Few people passed.The man out of the last house passed on his way home; she heard his footsteps clacking along the concrete pavement and afterwards crunching on the cinder path before the new red houses.One time there used to be a field there in which they used to play every evening with other people’s children.Then a man from Belfast bought the field and built houses in it—not like their little brown houses but bright brick houses with shining roofs.The children of the avenue used to play together in that field—the Devines, the Waters, the Dunns, little Keogh the cripple, she and her brothers and sisters.Ernest, however, never played: he was too grown up.Her father used often to hunt them in out of the field with his blackthorn stick; but usually little Keogh used to keep nix and call out when he saw her father coming.Still they seemed to have been rather happy then.Her father was not so bad then; and besides, her mother was alive.That was a long time ago; she and her brothers and sisters were all grown up her mother was dead.Tizzie Dunn was dead, too, and the Waters had gone back to England.Everything changes.Now she was going to go away like the others, to leave her home."
"家！她环视着房间，再次审视着所有熟悉的物件，她每周一次为它们除尘已经有好多年了，她很奇怪到底从哪来的那么多灰尘。也许她将永远也看不到这些熟悉的物件了，她做梦都没想到过会和它们分开。不过，这么多年来，她一直都没搞清楚那个神父的名字。他那张发黄的照片挂在一架破风琴上方的墙上，旁边是耶稣对圣玛格丽特·玛丽·阿拉科克许诺的彩色图画。他是她父亲的一位校友。每当要给客人看这张照片的时候，她父亲总会一边递照片一边随口说道：","Home!She looked round the room, reviewing all its familiar objects which she had dusted once a week for so many years, wondering where on earth all the dust came from.Perhaps she would never see again those familiar objects from which she had never dreamed of being divided.And yet during all those years she had never found out the name of the priest whose yellowing photograph hung on the wall above the broken harmonium beside the coloured print of the promises made to Blessed Margaret Mary Alacoque.He had been a school friend of her father.Whenever he showed the photograph to a visitor her father used to pass it with a casual word:"
"“他现在在墨尔本。”","“He is in Melbourne now.”"
"她已经决意要走，离开她的家。这明智吗？她努力权衡着这个问题的各个方面。在她家里不管怎么说她都有吃有住；她身边还有那些从小一起长大的朋友。当然，她必须得努力干活，无论是在家里还是在工作的地方。要是他们发现她和一个男人跑了，商店里的人会怎么说她呢？会说她是个傻子，也许吧；她的空位会通过广告来找人填补。加万小姐会很高兴。她总是要占她的上风，尤其是有人在听她们说话的时候。","She had consented to go away, to leave her home.Was that wise?She tried to weigh each side of the question.In her home anyway she had shelter and food; she had those whom she had known all her life about her.Of course she had to work hard, both in the house and at business.What would they say of her in the Stores when they found out that she had run away with a fellow?Say she was a fool, perhaps; and her place would be filled up by advertisement.Miss Gavan would be glad.She had always had an edge on her, especially whenever there were people listening."
"“希尔小姐，难道你没看见这些女士都在等着吗？”","“Miss Hill, don’t you see these ladies are waiting?”"

"但是在她的新家，在一个遥远陌生的国家，情况就不像这样了。到时候，她会结婚——她，伊夫琳。到时候人们会怀着敬意对待她。她不会遭受她母亲曾经有过的那种待遇。现在，尽管她已经过了十九岁，她有时还会感觉到自己有遭受父亲暴打的危险。她知道正是这个原因使得她总是心惊肉跳。在他们成长的过程中，他还从来没有像他打哈利和欧内斯特那样打过她，因为她是个女孩，但是最近他开始威胁她，说要不是因为她死去母亲他会如何对待她。而现在她找不到人来保护她。欧内斯特死了，而哈里干的是装修教堂的活儿，几乎总是在乡下的某个地方呆着。另外，每个星期六晚上为了钱而发生的争吵已经使她开始感到说不出的厌倦。她总是交出她全部的薪水——七先令——而哈里也总是尽其所能地寄钱回来，但问题是从她父亲那里要不到钱。他说她常常乱花钱，说她没有脑子，还说他不会把自己辛苦赚来的钱拿给她到街上去挥霍等等，因为星期六晚上他的情绪通常都特别坏。最终他会把钱给她并问她是否打算去买星期天晚饭吃的东西。然后她就飞快地冲出去买东西，手里紧紧地攥着黑色的皮钱夹，挤着穿过人群，然后背着各种食物很晚才回到家。她要辛苦工作来维持这个家，还要负责留给她照看的两个孩子按时上学，按时吃饭。工作很辛苦——生活也很辛苦——可现在她即将离开的时候，她却发现这种生活并非完全不尽如人意。","But in her new home, in a distant unknown country, it would not be like that.Then she would be married—she, Eveline.People would treat her with respect then.She would not be treated as her mother had been.Even now, though she was over nineteen, she sometimes felt herself in danger of her father’s violence.She knew it was that that had given her the palpitations.When they were growing up he had never gone for her like he used to go for Harry and Ernest, because she was a girl but latterly he had begun to threaten her and say what he would do to her only for her dead mother’s sake.And now she had nobody to protect her.Ernest was dead and Harry, who was in the church decorating business, was nearly always down somewhere in the country.Besides, the invariable squabble for money on Saturday nights had begun to weary her unspeakably.She always gave her entire wages—seven shillings—and Harry always sent up what he could but the trouble was to get any money from her father.He said she used to squander the money, that she had no head, that he wasn’t going to give her his hard-earned money to throw about the streets, and much more, for he was usually fairly bad on Saturday night.In the end he would give her the money and ask her had she any intention of buying Sunday’s dinner.Then she had to rush out as quickly as she could and do her marketing, holding her black leather purse tightly in her hand as she elbowed her way through the crowds and returning home late under her load of provisions.She had hard work to keep the house together and to see that the two young children who had been left to her charge went to school regularly and got their meals regularly.It was hard work—a hard life—but now that she was about to leave it she did not find it a wholly undesirable life."
"她就要和弗兰克一起去探索另一种生活了。弗兰克很和善，有男子汉气概，而且坦率热诚。她会和他乘坐夜间轮船离开，然后成为他的妻子，和他一起生活在布宜诺斯艾利斯，在那里他已经准备好了一个家在等着她。她依然清楚地记得她初次见他的情形；他当时正寄住在主路上的一栋房子里，那里她经常去。那似乎还是几个星期以前的事。他正站在门口，鸭舌帽推到后脑上，头发向前散在一张古铜色的脸上。然后他们就彼此认识了。他曾经每天晚上都在商店外面和她见面，然后送她回家。他带她去看《波西米亚女郎》；当她和他坐在剧院里难得的位置时，她感到非常开心。他非常喜欢音乐，而且还会唱上几段。人们知道他们在恋爱，而当他唱起关于姑娘爱上了水手的歌曲时，她却总是在高兴之余感到困惑。他常常出于好玩而叫她“小宝贝”。起初，对她而言有个男人作伴是一件值得兴奋的事；到后来，她开始喜欢上了他。他知道许多遥远国度的故事。他一开始在阿伦航线上一艘开往加拿大的轮船上做水手，一个月一英镑。他告诉她他曾呆过的轮船的名字以及他曾做过的不同活计的名称。他曾乘船经过麦哲伦海峡，他给她讲有关可怕的巴塔哥尼亚人的故事。他已经在布宜诺斯艾利斯站住了脚，他说，回到故国来只是为了度假。当然，她父亲已经发现了这件事，并禁止她再和他说话。","She was about to explore another life with Frank.Frank was very kind, manly, open-hearted.She was to go away with him by the night-boat to be his wife and to live with him in Buenos Ayres where he had a home waiting for her.How well she remembered the first time she had seen him; he was lodging in a house on the main road where she used to visit.It seemed a few weeks ago.He was standing at the gate, his peaked cap pushed back on his head and his hair tumbled forward over a face of bronze.Then they had come to know each other.He used to meet her outside the Stores every evening and see her home.He took her to see The Bohemian Girl and she felt elated as she sat in an unaccustomed part of the theatre with him.He was awfully fond of music and sang a little.People knew that they were courting and, when he sang about the lass that loves a sailor, she always felt pleasantly confused.He used to call her Poppens out of fun.First of all it had been an excitement for her to have a fellow and then she had begun to like him.He had tales of distant countries.He had started as a deck boy at a pound a month on a ship of the Allan Line going out to Canada.He told her the names of the ships he had been on and the names of the different services.He had sailed through the Straits of Magellan and he told her stories of the terrible Patagonians.He had fallen on his feet in Buenos Ayres, he said, and had come over to the old country just for a holiday.Of course, her father had found out the affair and had forbidden her to have anything to say to him."
"“我了解这帮水手小子。”他说。","“I know these sailor chaps,” he said."
"有一天，他和弗兰克吵了一架。在那之后，她就只得和她的情人偷偷见面了。","One day he had quarrelled with Frank and after that she had to meet her lover secretly."
"街上的夜色加深了。她腿上搁着的两封白色的信也变得模糊起来。一封是给哈里的；另一封是给她的父亲。欧内斯特曾经是她的最爱，不过她也喜欢哈里。她注意到，她的父亲近来变老了；他会想念她的。有时他人还是很好的。不久前，有一天她卧病在床，他给他读鬼故事，还在火上给她烤面包片吃。还有一天，他们的母亲还活着的时候，他们一家人去霍斯山上野餐。她记得父亲戴上母亲的圆帽逗孩子们笑。","The evening deepened in the avenue.The white of two letters in her lap grew indistinct.One was to Harry; the other was to her father.Ernest had been her favourite but she liked Harry too.Her father was becoming old lately, she noticed; he would miss her.Sometimes he could be very nice.Not long before, when she had been laid up for a day, he had read her out a ghost story and made toast for her at the fire.Another day, when their mother was alive, they had all gone for a picnic to the Hill of Howth.She remembered her father putting on her mother's bonnet to make the children laugh."
"她的时间在一分一秒减少，可她还继续坐在窗户旁边，她的头斜靠在窗帘上，呼吸着布满灰尘的印花棉布的气味。窗外远处的大街上，她听到有人在演奏街头风琴。她知道那支曲子。很奇怪，它会在那个晚上响起，提醒她曾对母亲许过的誓言，她发誓有生之年都决不让家人分离。她想起了母亲病重的最后一晚；她也是呆在客厅一侧这间紧闭的黑屋子里，她听到外面传来了忧伤的意大利乐曲的声音。父亲给了那个演奏风琴的人六便士，然后喝斥他走开了。她记得父亲大步走回病室说道：","Her time was running out but she continued to sit by the window, leaning her head against the window curtain, inhaling the odour of dusty cretonne.Down far in the avenue she could hear a street organ playing.She knew the air. Strange that it should come that very night to remind her of the promise to her mother, her promise to keep the home together as long as she could.She remembered the last night of her mother’s illness; she was again in the close dark room at the other side of the hall and outside she heard a melancholy air of Italy.The organ-player had been ordered to go away and given sixpence.She remembered her father strutting back into the sickroom saying:"
"“该死的意大利佬！竟然到这儿来！”","“Damned Italians!Coming over here!”"
"当她沉思冥想的时候，母亲一生那可怜的情景震慑了她的灵魂深处——那是充满了平凡的牺牲而最后以疯狂结束的一生。她颤抖起来，因为她又听到了母亲的声音，带着愚昧的执着不断说着：","As she mused the pitiful vision of her mother’s life laid its spell on the very quick of her being—that life of commonplace sacrifices closing in final craziness.She trembled as she heard again her mother’s voice saying constantly with foolish insistence:"
"“我的宝贝!我的宝贝!”她突然感到一阵恐惧，站了起来。逃走！她必须要逃走！弗兰克会救她的。他会给她生活，也许还有爱。可是她想生活。为什么她就应该不幸福呢？她有权追求幸福。弗兰克会把她揽入怀中，把她抱在怀中。他会救她。","“Derevaun Seraun!Derevaun Seraun!”She stood up in a sudden impulse of terror.Escape! She must escape!Frank would save her.He would give her life, perhaps love, too.But she wanted to live.Why should she be unhappy?She had a right to happiness.Frank would take her in his arms, fold her in his arms.He would save her."
"她站在北墙码头站拥来拥去的人群中。他抓着她的手，她知道他在跟她说话，说有关这次旅行的什么事，一遍又一遍。站台挤满了掮着棕色行李的士兵。透过棚屋宽敞的房门，她瞥见了那艘船黑色的船身，在码头墙附近停泊着，船舱的窗孔里都亮着灯。她没有回答。她觉得自己的脸颊苍白而冰冷；出于一种痛苦的迷惘，她祈求上帝为她指引方向，为她指明什么是她的责任。轮船在迷雾中发出一声悠长的哀鸣。如果她走了，明天她就会在海上，和弗兰克一起，朝布宜诺斯艾利斯驶去。他们的船票早已经预订好了。在他为她做了所有这一切之后，她还能反悔吗？她的痛苦使她的内心感到一阵恶心，她不停地嚅动着嘴唇，默默地、热切地祈祷着。","She stood among the swaying crowd in the station at the North Wall.He held her hand and she knew that he was speaking to her, saying something about the passage over and over again.The station was full of soldiers with brown baggages.Through the wide doors of the sheds she caught a glimpse of the black mass of the boat, lying in beside the quay wall, with illumined portholes.She answered nothing.She felt her cheek pale and cold and, out of a maze of distress, she prayed to God to direct her, to show her what was her duty.The boat blew a long mournful whistle into the mist.If she went, tomorrow she would be on the sea with Frank, steaming towards Buenos Ayres.Their passage had been booked.Could she still draw back after all he had done for her?Her distress awoke a nausea in her body and she kept moving her lips in silent fervent prayer."
"一阵铃声在心头叮当响起。她感觉到他抓住了她的手：","A bell clanged upon her heart.She felt him seize her hand:"
"“来！”","“Come!”"
"世间所有的海水在她的心里翻腾激荡。他正拉着她进入其中：他会把她淹死。她用双手紧紧地抓住了铁栏杆。","All the seas of the world tumbled about her heart.He was drawing her into them: he would drown her.She gripped with both hands at the iron railing."
"“来呀！”","“Come!”"
"不！不！不！这不可能！她的双手狂乱地抓着铁栏杆。在内心的波涛汹涌之中，她发出了一声痛苦的尖叫。","No!No!No!It was impossible.Her hands clutched the iron in frenzy.Amid the seas she sent a cry of anguish."
"“伊夫琳！伊薇！”","“Eveline! Evvy!”"
"他冲过栅栏，叫她跟上去。有人催叫他上船，可是他却仍然在呼唤她。她把苍白的脸冲着他，漠然无情，像一只无助的动物。她的眼睛传达给他的没有爱意，没有别情，也没有相识相知。","He rushed beyond the barrier and called to her to follow.He was shouted at to go on but he still called to her.She set her white face to him, passive, like a helpless animal.Her eyes gave him no sign of love or farewell or recognition."
"","CHAPTER 5 AFTER THE RACE"
"","THE cars came scudding in towards Dublin, running evenly like pellets in the groove of the Naas Road.At the crest of the hill at Inchicore sightseers had gathered in clumps to watch the cars careering homeward and through this channel of poverty and inaction the Continent sped its wealth and industry.Now and again the clumps of people raised the cheer of the gratefully oppressed.Their sympathy, however, was for the blue cars—the cars of their friends, the French."
"","The French, moreover, were virtual victors.Their team had finished solidly; they had been placed second and third and the driver of the winning German car was reported a Belgian.Each blue car, therefore, received a double measure of welcome as it topped the crest of the hill and each cheer of welcome was acknowledged with smiles and nods by those in the car.In one of these trimly built cars was a party of four young men whose spirits seemed to be at present well above the level of successful Gallicism: in fact, these four young men were almost hilarious.They were Charles Segouin, the owner of the car; Andre Riviere, a young electrician of Canadian birth; a huge Hungarian named Villona and a neatly groomed young man named Doyle.Segouin was in good humour because he had unexpectedly received some orders in advance (he was about to start a motor establishment in Paris) and Riviere was in good humour because he was to be appointed manager of the establishment; these two young men (who were cousins) were also in good humour because of the success of the French cars.Villona was in good humour because he had had a very satisfactory luncheon; and besides he was an optimist by nature.The fourth member of the party, however, was too excited to be genuinely happy."
"","He was about twenty-six years of age, with a soft, light brown moustache and rather innocent-looking grey eyes.His father, who had begun life as an advanced Nationalist, had modified his views early.He had made his money as a butcher in Kingstown and by opening shops in Dublin and in the suburbs he had made his money many times over.He had also been fortunate enough to secure some of the police contracts and in the end he had become rich enough to be alluded to in the Dublin newspapers as a merchant prince.He had sent his son to England to be educated in a big Catholic college and had afterwards sent him to Dublin University to study law. Jimmy did not study very earnestly and took to bad courses for a while.He had money and he was popular; and he divided his time curiously between musical and motoring circles.Then he had been sent for a term to Cambridge to see a little life.His father, remonstrative, but covertly proud of the excess, had paid his bills and brought him home.It was at Cambridge that he had met Segouin.They were not much more than acquaintances as yet but Jimmy found great pleasure in the society of one who had seen so much of the world and was reputed to own some of the biggest hotels in France.Such a person (as his father agreed) was well worth knowing, even if he had not been the charming companion he was.Villona was entertaining also—a brilliant pianist—but, unfortunately, very poor."
"","The car ran on merrily with its cargo of hilarious youth.The two cousins sat on the front seat; Jimmy and his Hungarian friend sat behind.Decidedly Villona was in excellent spirits; he kept up a deep bass hum of melody for miles of the road. The Frenchmen flung their laughter and light words over their shoulders and often Jimmy had to strain forward to catch the quick phrase.This was not altogether pleasant for him, as he had nearly always to make a deft guess at the meaning and shout back a suitable answer in the face of a high wind.Besides Villona’s humming would confuse anybody; the noise of the car, too."
"","Rapid motion through space elates one; so does notoriety; so does the possession of money.These were three good reasons for Jimmy’s excitement.He had been seen by many of his friends that day in the company of these Continentals.At the control Segouin had presented him to one of the French competitors and, in answer to his confused murmur of compliment, the swarthy face of the driver had disclosed a line of shining white teeth.It was pleasant after that honour to return to the profane world of spectators amid nudges and significant looks.Then as to money—he really had a great sum under his control.Segouin, perhaps, would not think it a great sum but Jimmy who, in spite of temporary errors, was at heart the inheritor of solid instincts knew well with what difficulty it had been got together.This knowledge had previously kept his bills within the limits of reasonable recklessness, and if he had been so conscious of the labour latent in money when there had been question merely of some freak of the higher intelligence, how much more so now when he was about to stake the greater part of his substance!It was a serious thing for him."
"","Of course, the investment was a good one and Segouin had managed to give the impression that it was by a favour of friendship the mite of Irish money was to be included in the capital of the concern.Jimmy had a respect for his father’s shrewdness in business matters and in this case it had been his father who had first suggested the investment; money to be made in the motor business, pots of money.Moreover Segouin had the unmistakable air of wealth.Jimmy set out to translate into days’ work that lordly car in which he sat. How smoothly it ran. In what style they had come careering along the country roads!The journey laid a magical finger on the genuine pulse of life and gallantly the machinery of human nerves strove to answer the bounding courses of the swift blue animal."
"","They drove down Dame Street.The street was busy with unusual traffic, loud with the horns of motorists and the gongs of impatient tram-drivers.Near the Bank Segouin drew up and Jimmy and his friend alighted.A little knot of people collected on the footpath to pay homage to the snorting motor.The party was to dine together that evening in Segouin’s hotel and, meanwhile, Jimmy and his friend, who was staying with him, were to go home to dress.The car steered out slowly for Grafton Street while the two young men pushed their way through the knot of gazers.They walked northward with a curious feeling of disappointment in the exercise, while the city hung its pale globes of light above them in a haze of summer evening."
"","In Jimmy’s house this dinner had been pronounced an occasion.A certain pride mingled with his parents’ trepidation, a certain eagerness, also, to play fast and loose for the names of great foreign cities have at least this virtue.Jimmy, too, looked very well when he was dressed and, as he stood in the hall giving a last equation to the bows of his dress tie, his father may have felt even commercially satisfied at having secured for his son qualities often unpurchaseable.His father, therefore, was unusually friendly with Villona and his manner expressed a real respect for foreign accomplishments; but this subtlety of his host was probably lost upon the Hungarian, who was beginning to have a sharp desire for his dinner."
"","The dinner was excellent, exquisite.Segouin, Jimmy decided, had a very refined taste.The party was increased by a young Englishman named Routh whom Jimmy had seen with Segouin at Cambridge.The young men supped in a snug room lit by electric candle lamps.They talked volubly and with little reserve.Jimmy, whose imagination was kindling, conceived the lively youth of the Frenchmen twined elegantly upon the firm framework of the Englishman’s manner.A graceful image of his, he thought, and a just one.He admired the dexterity with which their host directed the conversation.The five young men had various tastes and their tongues had been loosened.Villona, with immense respect, began to discover to the mildly surprised Englishman the beauties of the English madrigal, deploring the loss of old instruments.Riviere, not wholly ingenuously, undertook to explain to Jimmy the triumph of the French mechanicians.The resonant voice of the Hungarian was about to prevail in ridicule of the spurious lutes of the romantic painters when Segouin shepherded his party into politics.Here was congenial ground for all.Jimmy, under generous influences, felt the buried zeal of his father wake to life within him: he aroused the torpid Routh at last.The room grew doubly hot and Segouin’s task grew harder each moment: there was even danger of personal spite.The alert host at an opportunity lifted his glass to Humanity and, when the toast had been drunk, he threw open a window significantly."
"","That night the city wore the mask of a capital.The five young men strolled along Stephen’s Green in a faint cloud of aromatic smoke.They talked loudly and gaily and their cloaks dangled from their shoulders.The people made way for them.At the corner of Grafton Street a short fat man was putting two handsome ladies on a car in charge of another fat man.The car drove off and the short fat man caught sight of the party."
"","“Andre.”"
"","“It’s Farley!”"
"","A torrent of talk followed.Farley was an American.No one knew very well what the talk was about.Villona and Riviere were the noisiest, but all the men were excited.They got up on a car, squeezing themselves together amid much laughter.They drove by the crowd, blended now into soft colours, to a music of merry bells.They took the train at Westland Row and in a few seconds, as it seemed to Jimmy, they were walking out of Kingstown Station.The ticket-collector saluted Jimmy; he was an old man:"
"","“Fine night, sir!”"
"","It was a serene summer night; the harbour lay like a darkened mirror at their feet.They proceeded towards it with linked arms, singing Cadet Roussel in chorus, stamping their feet at every:"
"","“Ho!Ho! Hohe, vraiment!”They got into a rowboat at the slip and made out for the American’s yacht.There was to be supper, music, cards.Villona said with conviction:"
"","“It is delightful!”"
"","There was a yacht piano in the cabin.Villona played a waltz for Farley and Riviere, Farley acting as cavalier and Riviere as lady.Then an impromptu square dance, the men devising original figures.What merriment!Jimmy took his part with a will; this was seeing life, at least.Then Farley got out of breath and cried “Stop!” A man brought in a light supper, and the young men sat down to it for form’s sake.They drank, however: it was Bohemian.They drank Ireland, England, France, Hungary, the United States of America.Jimmy made a speech, a long speech, Villona saying: “Hear! Hear!”whenever there was a pause."
"","There was a great clapping of hands when he sat down.It must have been a good speech.Farley clapped him on the back and laughed loudly.What jovial fellows!What good company they were!"
"","Cards!Cards! The table was cleared. Villona returned quietly to his piano and played voluntaries for them.The other men played game after game, flinging themselves boldly into the adventure.They drank the health of the Queen of Hearts and of the Queen of Diamonds.Jimmy felt obscurely the lack of an audience: the wit was flashing.Play ran very high and paper began to pass.Jimmy did not know exactly who was winning but he knew that he was losing.But it was his own fault for he frequently mistook his cards and the other men had to calculate his I.O.U.’s for him.They were devils of fellows but he wished they would stop: it was getting late.Someone gave the toast of the yacht The Belle of Newport and then someone proposed one great game for a finish."
"","The piano had stopped; Villona must have gone up on deck.It was a terrible game.They stopped just before the end of it to drink for luck.Jimmy understood that the game lay between Routh and Segouin.What excitement!Jimmy was excited too; he would lose, of course.How much had he written away?The men rose to their feet to play the last tricks, talking and gesticulating."
"","Routh won. The cabin shook with the young men’s cheering and the cards were bundled together.They began then to gather in what they had won. Farley and Jimmy were the heaviest losers."
"","He knew that he would regret in the morning but at present he was glad of the rest, glad of the dark stupor that would cover up his folly.He leaned his elbows on the table and rested his head between his hands, counting the beats of his temples.The cabin door opened and he saw the Hungarian standing in a shaft of grey light:"
"","“Daybreak, gentlemen!”"
"第六章 两个风流汉","CHAPTER 6 TWO GALLANTS"
"灰色温暖的八月之夜已经降临到这座城市，一种柔和温暖的空气，一种夏天的记忆，散播在街道上。因为星期天是休息日，店铺都关了门，街道上挤满了着装艳丽的行人。仿佛发光的珍珠一样，路灯从它们那高高的灯杆顶端把光线洒向下面生动的尘世；而这生动的尘世则不停地变换着形状和色彩，向上给温暖灰色的夜空传送着一种一成不变、永不停歇的低语。","THE grey warm evening of August had descended upon the city and a mild warm air, a memory of summer, circulated in the streets.The streets, shuttered for the repose of Sunday, swarmed with a gaily coloured crowd.Like illumined pearls the lamps shone from the summits of their tall poles upon the living texture below which, changing shape and hue unceasingly, sent up into the warm grey evening air an unchanging unceasing murmur."
"两个年轻男子从拉特兰广场的小山上走了下来。其中一个正要结束一段冗长的独白。另一个走在路沿上，但由于其同伴的粗鲁行为不时地被挤到路面上，他露出一副听得颇有兴致的样子。他身材矮胖，脸色红润。一顶游艇帽从前额推到很靠后脑的地方，他正在倾听的那番讲述让他脸上表情纹不断，波及鼻翼两侧还有眼角和嘴角。带着喘气的笑声一阵一阵地从他那颤抖的身体中迸发出来。他的眼睛闪动着狡黠的喜悦，不断地朝同伴的脸上瞥去。有一两次，他重新调整了一下那件浅色雨衣的位置，之前他一直像斗牛士那样把它搭在一侧肩上。他穿着的马裤和白色胶鞋，还有那潇洒地搭在肩头上的雨衣，无一不彰显着年轻。但是他的身形在腰部趋于圆胖，他的头发稀疏灰白，而他的脸在表情纹扫过的时候则呈现出一种饱经沧桑的样子。","Two young men came down the hill of Rutland Square.One of them was just bringing a long monologue to a close.The other, who walked on the verge of the path and was at times obliged to step on to the road, owing to his companion’s rudeness, wore an amused listening face.He was squat and ruddy.A yachting cap was shoved far back from his forehead and the narrative to which he listened made constant waves of expression break forth over his face from the corners of his nose and eyes and mouth.Little jets of wheezing laughter followed one another out of his convulsed body.His eyes, twinkling with cunning enjoyment, glanced at every moment towards his companion’s face.Once or twice he rearranged the light waterproof which he had slung over one shoulder in toreador fashion.His breeches, his white rubber shoes and his jauntily slung waterproof expressed youth.But his figure fell into rotundity at the waist, his hair was scant and grey and his face, when the waves of expression had passed over it, had a ravaged look."
"当他十分确信讲述已经结束的时候，他不出声地笑了足足有半分钟。然后他说道：","When he was quite sure that the narrative had ended he laughed noiselessly for fully half a minute.Then he said:"
"“哇噢！……那真是惊人之举！”他的声音似乎缺乏力度；为了加强话语的效果，他又语带幽默地补充道：","“Well!...That takes the biscuit!”His voice seemed winnowed of vigour; and to enforce his words he added with humour:"
"“那真是唯一的、独特的，而且，如果我可以这样形容它的话，罕有的惊人之举！”","“That takes the solitary, unique, and, if I may so call it, recherche biscuit!”"
"说完这些之后，他变得严肃沉默起来。他的舌头累了，因为整个下午在多塞特街上的一家酒馆里他一直都在说话。大多数人都认为雷尼汉是个寄生虫，不过尽管有这样的名声，他的精明善辩却总是让他的朋友们难以形成任何反对他的统一立场。他有一种无畏的风度：在酒吧里他会凑近一帮人，然后机敏地守在一旁，直到他们请他加入请客的轮次之中。他是个喜欢冒险的游荡汉，脑子里存有大量的故事、打油诗和谜语。对于各种无礼的行为，他都无动于衷。没人知道他是怎样应对严酷的生活，不过他的名字多少会让人联想起跑马彩票。","He became serious and silent when he had said this.His tongue was tired for he had been talking all the afternoon in a public-house in Dorset Street.Most people considered Lenehan a leech but, in spite of this reputation, his adroitness and eloquence had always prevented his friends from forming any general policy against him.He had a brave manner of coming up to a party of them in a bar and of holding himself nimbly at the borders of the company until he was included in a round.He was a sporting vagrant armed with a vast stock of stories, limericks and riddles.He was insensitive to all kinds of discourtesy.No one knew how he achieved the stern task of living, but his name was vaguely associated with racing tissues."
"“科利，你在什么地方认识她的？”他问道。","“And where did you pick her up, Corley?” he asked."
"科利用舌头飞快地舔了舔上嘴唇。","Corley ran his tongue swiftly along his upper lip."
"“有一天晚上，伙计，”他说，“我正沿着戴姆街往前走，猛然就看见一个漂亮妞站在沃特豪斯公司的大钟下面，然后我就冲她说了声晚上好，你知道。于是我们就到运河旁边散了会儿步，她告诉我说她在位于巴哥特大街的一户人家做打杂女仆。那天晚上，我用胳膊搂着她，紧抱着她好一会儿。然后第二个星期天，伙计，我就是和她约好见面的了。我们去了唐尼布鲁克，我把她带进了那里的一块空地。她告诉我说她过去常和一个牛奶工一起到那里……很不错，伙计。每天晚上她都会带香烟给我，还付来回的电车票钱。有一天晚上，她给我拿来两根绝好的雪茄——啊，真是好东西，你知道，是老家伙过去常抽的那种……当时我还担心，伙计，她是不是怀孕了呢。不过她该想法避免的。”","“One night, man,” he said, “I was going along Dame Street and I spotted a fine tart under Waterhouse’s clock and said good-night, you know.So we went for a walk round by the canal and she told me she was a slavey in a house in Baggot Street.I put my arm round her and squeezed her a bit that night.Then next Sunday, man, I met her by appointment.We went out to Donnybrook and I brought her into a field there.She told me she used to go with a dairyman.... It was fine, man.Cigarettes every night she’d bring me and paying the tram out and back.And one night she brought me two bloody fine cigars—O, the real cheese, you know, that the old fellow used to smoke.... I was afraid, man, she’d get in the family way.But she’s up to the dodge.”"
"“也许她觉得你会娶她吧。”雷尼汉说道。","“Maybe she thinks you’ll marry her,” said Lenehan."
"“我告诉她我没有工作。”科利说，“我告诉她我眼下是在皮姆公司做事。她不知道我的名字。我太毛糙了所以忘了告诉她。不过她觉得我还挺有派头。”","“I told her I was out of a job,” said Corley.“I told her I was in Pim’s.She doesn’t know my name.I was too hairy to tell her that.But she thinks I’m a bit of class, you know.”"
"雷尼汉又笑了起来，还是毫不出声。","Lenehan laughed again, noiselessly."
"“在我听说过的所有好事中，”他说，“这一件可真是好得没法说了。”","“Of all the good ones ever I heard,” he said, “that emphatically takes the biscuit.”"
"科利昂首阔步，坦然接受了这番恭维话。他那高大魁梧的身体左右摇摆着，使得他的朋友在人行道和马路之间来回小跳了好几次。科利是一位警务督察的儿子，他继承了父亲的体格和胆量。他走路时两手叉腰，身体笔直，脑袋摇来晃去。他的头很大，圆乎乎、油光光的；不管什么天气它总爱出汗；他那顶大圆帽斜戴在头上，看起来就像是从一个球体上又长出了一个球体。他总是直视前方，仿佛在接受检阅，当他想要盯着街上的某个人看时，他就必须得扭动他的腰。眼下他正在城里四处转悠。每当有什么工作缺人，总会有某个朋友一本正经劝他去做。人们常常能看见他和便衣警察们走在一起，严肃认真地说着话。他了解所有事情的内幕，并且喜欢盖棺定论。他说话的时候并不听同行的伙伴们在说什么。他的谈话大多是关于他自己：他和某人说什么了，那个人和他说什么了，最后他又是怎么说的才解决了那件事。当他讲述这些对话时，他会像佛罗伦萨人那样把自己名字的第一个字母发成送气音。","Corley’s stride acknowledged the compliment.The swing of his burly body made his friend execute a few light skips from the path to the roadway and back again.Corley was the son of an inspector of police and he had inherited his father’s frame and gut.He walked with his hands by his sides, holding himself erect and swaying his head from side to side.His head was large, globular and oily; it sweated in all weathers; and his large round hat, set upon it sideways, looked like a bulb which had grown out of another.He always stared straight before him as if he were on parade and, when he wished to gaze after someone in the street, it was necessary for him to move his body from the hips.At present he was about town.Whenever any job was vacant a friend was always ready to give him the hard word.He was often to be seen walking with policemen in plain clothes, talking earnestly.He knew the inner side of all affairs and was fond of delivering final judgments.He spoke without listening to the speech of his companions.His conversation was mainly about himself what he had said to such a person and what such a person had said to him and what he had said to settle the matter.When he reported these dialogues he aspirated the first letter of his name after the manner of Florentines."
"雷尼汉递给他朋友一支香烟。当两个年轻人穿过人群继续往前走的时候，科利不时地扭头冲着一些路过的女孩微笑，而雷尼汉的目光却一直停留在那大而朦胧、有两层光环围绕着的月亮上。他认真地注视着暮色的灰网从月亮前面经过。最后他才说道：","Lenehan offered his friend a cigarette.As the two young men walked on through the crowd Corley occasionally turned to smile at some of the passing girls but Lenehan’s gaze was fixed on the large faint moon circled with a double halo.He watched earnestly the passing of the grey web of twilight across its face.At length he said:"
"“呃……告诉我，科利，我想你能把这件事做成对吧？”","“Well... tell me, Corley, I suppose you’ll be able to pull it off all right, eh?”"
"科利颇有深意地闭上一只眼作为回答。","Corley closed one eye expressively as an answer."
"“她有那个意思吗？”雷尼汉怀疑地问道，“你永远都弄不懂女人的。”","“Is she game for that?” asked Lenehan dubiously.“You can never know women.”"
"“没问题。”科利说，“我知道用什么办法哄她，伙计。她对我挺着迷的。”“你就是我说的那种快乐的罗萨里奥式的人物。”雷尼汉说，“而且还是一个彻头彻尾的罗萨里奥！”","“She’s all right,” said Corley.“I know the way to get around her, man.She’s a bit gone on me.”“You’re what I call a gay Lothario,” said Lenehan.“And the proper kind of a Lothario, too!”"
"些许嘲讽减轻了他态度中的过度逢迎。为了给自己留有余地，他已习惯于把自己的奉承话说得听起来像揶揄。可是科利的脑子却没有那么灵敏。","A shade of mockery relieved the servility of his manner.To save himself he had the habit of leaving his flattery open to the interpretation of raillery.But Corley had not a subtle mind."
"“这没什么，只不过是触动了一个还算不赖的女仆的心。”他肯定地说道，“在这事上你记住我的经验就行了。”","“There’s nothing to touch a good slavey,” he affirmed.“Take my tip for it.”"
"“这可是一个让她们每个人都动了心的人的经验。”雷尼汉说。","“By one who has tried them all,” said Lenehan."
"“起先我常常和姑娘们出去，你知道，”科利开诚布公地说道，“是那些南环路上的姑娘。我常常带她们出去，伙计，坐着电车去个地方，我付车钱，或者带她们到剧院去听乐队演出或是看戏，或者给她们买巧克力和糖果之类的东西。我那会儿花在她们身上的钱可真不算少，”他用一种令人信服的语调补充道，仿佛他意识到会被人怀疑似的。","“First I used to go with girls, you know,” said Corley, unbosoming; “girls off the South Circular.I used to take them out, man, on the tram somewhere and pay the tram or take them to a band or a play at the theatre or buy them chocolate and sweets or something that way. I used to spend money on them right enough,” he added, in a convincing tone, as if he was conscious of being disbelieved."
"不过雷尼汉还是很相信这些话的；他严肃地点了点头。","But Lenehan could well believe it; he nodded gravely."
"“我知道那档子事，”他说，“那可是无利可图的事。”","“I know that game,” he said, “and it’s a mug’s game.”"
"“让这些往事见鬼去吧。”科利说道。","“And damn the thing I ever got out of it,” said Corley."
"“就是嘛。”雷尼汉说。","“Ditto here,” said Lenehan."
"“只勾搭上了她们中的一个。”科利说。","“Only off of one of them,” said Corley."
"他伸出舌头润了一圈上唇。回忆点亮了他的眼睛。他也凝视着几乎被遮住了的月亮那苍白的圆盘，似乎陷入了沉思。","He moistened his upper lip by running his tongue along it. The recollection brightened his eyes.He too gazed at the pale disc of the moon, now nearly veiled, and seemed to meditate."
"“她……还算不错吧，”他不无遗憾地说道。","“She was... a bit of all right,” he said regretfully."
"他又沉默不语。然后他补充道：","He was silent again.Then he added:"
"“她现在开始做皮肉生意了。有一天晚上，我看见她开车沿着公爵街驶去，车上还坐着两个男人。”","“She’s on the turf now. I saw her driving down Earl Street one night with two fellows with her on a car.”"
"“我想那是你干的好事吧。”雷尼汉说。","“I suppose that’s your doing,” said Lenehan."
"“在我之前就有别人跟她好过了。”科利泰然自若地说道。","“There was others at her before me,” said Corley philosophically."
"这一次雷尼汉开始有些不相信了。他摇了摇头，笑了。","This time Lenehan was inclined to disbelieve.He shook his head to and fro and smiled."
"“你知道你骗不了我，科利。”他说道。","“You know you can’t kid me, Corley,” he said."
"“我向上帝发誓！”科利说，“难道不是她自己告诉我的吗？”","“Honest to God!” said Corley.“Didn’t she tell me herself?”"
"雷尼汉做了个悲叹的手势。","Lenehan made a tragic gesture."
"“卑鄙的负心汉！”他说。","“Base betrayer!” he said."
"当他们经过三一学院的围栏时，雷尼汉跳到了马路上，抬头瞥了一眼大钟。","As they passed along the railings of Trinity College, Lenehan skipped out into the road and peered up at the clock."
"“过了二十分钟了。”他说。","“Twenty after,” he said."
"“时间够用。”科利说道，“她肯定会在那儿等着。我总是让她多等一会儿。”雷尼汉轻声笑了。","“Time enough,” said Corley.“She’ll be there all right.I always let her wait a bit.”Lenehan laughed quietly."
"“哎呦！科利，你还真知道怎么对付她们呀。”他说。“我对她们那些小把戏都很在行。”科利坦白地说道。","“Ecod!Corley, you know how to take them,” he said.“I’m up to all their little tricks,” Corley confessed."
"“不过告诉我，”雷尼汉又说道。“你确信你能做成这件事？你知道这可是件棘手的事。到现在这份上她们可都会变得特缠人的。嗳？……怎么了？”","“But tell me,” said Lenehan again, “are you sure you can bring it off all right?You know it’s a ticklish job.They’re damn close on that point.Eh?... What?”"
"他那双明亮的小眼睛探寻着同伴的脸，试图得到确定的答案。科利来回摇了摇头，仿佛是想甩掉一只盘旋不去的飞虫，他的眉毛皱了起来。","His bright, small eyes searched his companion’s face for reassurance.Corley swung his head to and fro as if to toss aside an insistent insect, and his brows gathered."
"“我会搞定的。”他说，“让我自己来对付它，好吧？”","“I’ll pull it off,” he said.“Leave it to me, can’t you?”"
"雷尼汉不再说什么了。他不希望扰乱朋友的心情，不希望挨骂，也不希望听到自己的建议是多余的。看来一点小技巧是必要的。不过科利的眉头很快又舒展了开来。他的想法正在另一条思路上驰骋着。","Lenehan said no more.He did not wish to ruffle his friend’s temper, to be sent to the devil and told that his advice was not wanted.A little tact was necessary.But Corley’s brow was soon smooth again.His thoughts were running another way."
"“她是个漂亮得体的姑娘，”他很欣赏地说道，“那就是她的本色。”","“She’s a fine decent tart,” he said, with appreciation; “that’s what she is.”"
"他们沿拿骚街走着，然后拐到了基尔代尔街上。在离俱乐部门廊不远的地方，一个弹竖琴的人站在路上，正为一小圈听众演奏着。他心不在焉地拨弄着琴弦，一边不时厌倦地飞快扫视着每一位新加入的听众的脸，一边又同样厌倦地飞快扫视一下天空。他的竖琴（表面的涂层已经剥落到了角撑处）也似乎对陌生人的目光和主人的双手都感到了厌倦。一只手在低音部弹奏着《安静，啊，莫伊尔》的曲调，而另一只手在每弹完一小节音符之后则会到高音部飞快地划一下。那曲调的音符听起来深沉而饱满。","They walked along Nassau Street and then turned into Kildare Street.Not far from the porch of the club a harpist stood in the roadway, playing to a little ring of listeners.He plucked at the wires heedlessly, glancing quickly from time to time at the face of each new-comer and from time to time, wearily also, at the sky. His harp, too, heedless that her coverings had fallen about her knees, seemed weary alike of the eyes of strangers and of her master’s hands.One hand played in the bass the melody of Silent, O Moyle, while the other hand careered in the treble after each group of notes.The notes of the air sounded deep and full."
"两个年轻人沿着这条街往前走去，都一言不发，悲伤的音乐跟在他们身后。当到达斯蒂芬绿地的时候，他们过了马路。在这里，电车的噪响声、灯光还有人群使他们从沉默中摆脱了出来。","The two young men walked up the street without speaking, the mournful music following them.When they reached Stephen’s Green they crossed the road.Here the noise of trams, the lights and the crowd released them from their silence."
"“她在那儿！”科利说。","“There she is!” said Corley."
"在休姆街的拐角处，一个年轻女子正站在那里。她身穿一件蓝色的连衣裙，头戴一顶白色的水手帽。她站在路沿上，一只手里摇晃着一把遮阳伞。雷尼汉一下子变得活跃起来。","At the corner of Hume Street a young woman was standing.She wore a blue dress and a white sailor hat.She stood on the curbstone, swinging a sunshade in one hand.Lenehan grew lively."
"“让我们好好瞧瞧她，科利。”他说。","“Let’s have a look at her, Corley,” he said."
"科利斜眼看了一下他的朋友，一丝不悦的笑容浮现在他的脸上。","Corley glanced sideways at his friend and an unpleasant grin appeared on his face."
"“你打算插我一腿吗？”他问道。","“Are you trying to get inside me?” he asked."
"“去你的吧！”雷尼汉粗率地说，“我根本就不想认识她。我就是想看看她。我不会吃了她的。”","“Damn it!” said Lenehan boldly, “I don’t want an introduction.All I want is to have a look at her.I’m not going to eat her.”"
"“哦……看看她？”科利说道，语气友好了一些，“好吧……我告诉你怎么做。我先走过去和她说话，然后你可以从旁边经过。”","“O... A look at her?” said Corley, more amiably.“Well... I’ll tell you what.I’ll go over and talk to her and you can pass by.”"
"“行啊！”雷尼汉说。","“Right!” said Lenehan."
"科利一条腿已经迈过铁链，这时就听见雷尼汉喊道：","Corley had already thrown one leg over the chains when Lenehan called out:"
"“然后呢？我们在什么地方碰头？”“十点半。”科利回答道，同时另一条腿也跨了过去。","“And after?Where will we meet?”“Half ten,” answered Corley, bringing over his other leg."
"“在哪儿？”","“Where?”"
"“梅里恩街拐角。我们会回到那儿。”“那现在就好好干活吧。”雷尼汉话别道。","“Corner of Merrion Street.We’ll be coming back.”“Work it all right now,” said Lenehan in farewell."
"科利没有答话。他悠闲地穿过马路，脑袋来回摇晃着。他那块头、他那轻松的步伐以及他那靴子发出的结实的声响都很有点征服者的做派。他走近那位年轻女子，没有打招呼就直接开始和她说起话来。她摇晃阳伞的速度更快了，脚跟点着地，身体左右转动着。有一两次，当他靠得很近和她说话时，她大笑起来并低下了头。","Corley did not answer.He sauntered across the road swaying his head from side to side.His bulk, his easy pace, and the solid sound of his boots had something of the conqueror in them.He approached the young woman and, without saluting, began at once to converse with her.She swung her umbrella more quickly and executed half turns on her heels.Once or twice when he spoke to her at close quarters she laughed and bent her head."
"雷尼汉观察了他们有好几分钟。然后他迅速地沿着铁链走了一截之后躲躲闪闪地过了马路。当他走近休姆街拐角的时候，他觉察到空气中有浓重的香水味，他的眼睛快速而急切地打量了一下那个年轻女子的容貌。她身着礼拜日的盛装。她那件蓝色哔叽裙的腰身处系了一根黑色的皮带。皮带上那个银色的大搭扣似乎压住了她身体的中心，像一个夹子似的束住了她那白衬衫的轻薄衣料。她穿着一件黑色短夹克，上面缀着珠母纽扣，还围着一条破旧的黑色长围巾。她那绢纱衣领的两头被有意弄乱了，一大束红花倒别在她的胸前。雷尼汉的眼睛满是赞赏地注视着她那结实矮小、肌肉发达的身体。她的脸、她那胖嘟嘟的红脸颊以及她那毫不畏生的蓝眼睛都闪耀着十足的健康。她相貌粗笨。她长着宽大的鼻孔，嘴巴也不周正；在她心满意足地斜睨时，她的嘴巴会张开，露出两颗突出的门牙。当他经过的时候，雷尼汉脱帽致意，过了大约十秒钟之后，科利才冲着空中回了礼。他这回礼也就是含含糊糊、若有所思地抬起手动了动帽子而已。","Lenehan observed them for a few minutes.Then he walked rapidly along beside the chains at some distance and crossed the road obliquely.As he approached Hume Street corner he found the air heavily scented and his eyes made a swift anxious scrutiny of the young woman’s appearance.She had her Sunday finery on.Her blue serge skirt was held at the waist by a belt of black leather.The great silver buckle of her belt seemed to depress the centre of her body, catching the light stuff of her white blouse like a clip.She wore a short black jacket with mother-of-pearl buttons and a ragged black boa.The ends of her tulle collarette had been carefully disordered and a big bunch of red flowers was pinned in her bosom stems upwards.Lenehan’s eyes noted approvingly her stout short muscular body.Rank rude health glowed in her face, on her fat red cheeks and in her unabashed blue eyes.Her features were blunt.She had broad nostrils, a straggling mouth which lay open in a contented leer, and two projecting front teeth.As he passed Lenehan took off his cap and, after about ten seconds, Corley returned a salute to the air.This he did by raising his hand vaguely and pensively changing the angle of position of his hat."
"雷尼汉一直走到谢尔本饭店附近才停下来开始等着。等了一会儿，他看见他们俩朝自己走来，在他们拐向右边之后，他便跟了上去；他脚穿白鞋，沿着梅里恩广场的一侧步履轻盈地走着。他慢慢地往前走着，让自己的步调和他们保持一致，他看见科利的脑袋不断地转向那个女人的脸，看上去就像是一个大球在绕着一个中轴转动。他始终让他们俩保持在自己的视线之内，直到他看见他们登上了开往唐尼布鲁克的电车；然后他才转身沿着来时路往回走。","Lenehan walked as far as the Shelbourne Hotel where he halted and waited.After waiting for a little time he saw them coming towards him and, when they turned to the right, he followed them, stepping lightly in his white shoes, down one side of Merrion Square.As he walked on slowly, timing his pace to theirs, he watched Corley’s head which turned at every moment towards the young woman’s face like a big ball revolving on a pivot.He kept the pair in view until he had seen them climbing the stairs of the Donnybrook tram; then he turned about and went back the way he had come."
"现在他独自一人了，他的脸看上去显得有些苍老。那股高兴劲似乎开始离他而去，当他从公爵草坪的围栏旁经过时，他一路用手拨弄着栏杆。那个竖琴手刚刚演奏的曲调开始控制他的举动。他那穿着柔适的双脚踩着那支曲子的节拍，而他的手指则在每一组音符之后都会懒散地在栏杆上扫过一组变奏音阶。","Now that he was alone his face looked older.His gaiety seemed to forsake him and, as he came by the railings of the Duke’s Lawn, he allowed his hand to run along them.The air which the harpist had played began to control his movements. His softly padded feet played the melody while his fingers swept a scale of variations idly along the railings after each group of notes."
"他百无聊赖地绕过斯蒂芬绿地，然后走到了格拉夫顿大街上。从人群中经过时尽管他的眼睛注意到了它的形形色色，但却是充满阴郁的一种注意。他发觉一切意欲吸引他的东西都琐屑不堪，对于那些诱惑他去鲁莽行事的眼神他也不予理睬。他知道那会意味着他得说很多话，得去胡编乱造，得去逗人开心，可他的脑子和喉咙现在都干涩得很，根本不适合去做这种事。如何打发与科利碰头之前的这几个小时是个问题，多少有点让他感到困扰。他想不出别的什么办法来打发这些时间，只能继续往前走。当他来到拉特兰广场一角的时候，他向左拐了进去，黑暗静谧的街道让他感觉舒服了许多，阴沉的氛围正好契合了他的心情。最后他在一家样子寒酸的店铺前面停了下来，在橱窗上方有用白色字母印制的“点心酒吧”的字样。在橱窗玻璃上则有两组书写潦草的文字：“姜汁啤酒”和“姜汁麦芽酒”。一块切开的火腿摆在一个蓝色的大盘子上，旁边的一个盘子上则放着一块非常清淡的葡萄干布丁。他热切地盯着这些食物看了好一会儿，接着他警觉地朝街上四下看了一番，之后迅速走进了那家店铺。","He walked listlessly round Stephen’s Green and then down Grafton Street.Though his eyes took note of many elements of the crowd through which he passed they did so morosely.He found trivial all that was meant to charm him and did not answer the glances which invited him to be bold.He knew that he would have to speak a great deal, to invent and to amuse and his brain and throat were too dry for such a task.The problem of how he could pass the hours till he met Corley again troubled him a little.He could think of no way of passing them but to keep on walking.He turned to the left when he came to the corner of Rutland Square and felt more at ease in the dark quiet street, the sombre look of which suited his mood.He paused at last before the window of a poor-looking shop over which the words Refreshment Bar were printed in white letters.On the glass of the window were two flying inscriptions: Ginger Beer and Ginger Ale.A cut ham was exposed on a great blue dish while near it on a plate lay a segment of very light plum-pudding.He eyed this food earnestly for some time and then, after glancing warily up and down the street, went into the shop quickly."
"他饿了，因为除了几块饼干（是他求两个老大不愿意的酒保招待拿给他的）之外，从早饭到现在他什么也没吃。他在一张没铺台布的木桌旁边坐下，对面是两个年轻女工和一个技工。一个邋里邋遢的女孩过来招待他。","He was hungry for, except some biscuits which he had asked two grudging curates to bring him, he had eaten nothing since breakfast-time.He sat down at an uncovered wooden table opposite two work-girls and a mechanic.A slatternly girl waited on him."
"“多少钱一盘豌豆？”他问道。","“How much is a plate of peas?” he asked."
"“三个半便士，先生。”女孩答道。","“Three halfpence, sir,” said the girl."
"“给我来一盘豌豆，”他说，“还有一瓶姜汁啤酒。”","“Bring me a plate of peas,” he said, “and a bottle of ginger beer.”"
"他故意粗声粗气地说话，以掩饰他的文雅风度，因为刚才他的到来使店里的谈话一时停了下来。他脸上发热。为了看起来更自然些，他把帽子推到了后脑，把两只胳膊肘支在了桌上。那名技工和那两名女工在仔仔细细地打量了他一番之后才用压低了的声音恢复了他们的谈话。女招待给他端来了一盘撒有胡椒和醋的廉价的热豌豆，还拿来了一把叉子以及他要的姜汁啤酒。他贪婪地吃着他点的食物，感觉异常好吃，于是他便用心记下了这家店铺。他吃光了所有的豌豆，然后呷饮着他的姜汁啤酒，坐着有好一会儿，琢磨起科利的冒险来。在他的想象中，他看到那对情侣正沿着某条黑暗的马路漫步；他听到科利用低沉的声音兴致勃勃地说着殷勤话，而且又看到了那个年轻女子的嘴巴流露出的娇嗔。这种幻想使他强烈地感受到了自己在物质和精神上的贫乏。他厌倦了四处漂泊，厌倦了同贫困作斗争，也厌倦了欺诈和诡计。到十一月他就三十一岁了。难道他永远都找不到一份好工作吗？难道他永远都不会拥有一个属于自己的家吗？他想，要是能坐在暖和的炉火旁边，坐下来吃一顿不错的晚餐，那会是多么惬意啊！他在这些街道上和朋友们游逛、和姑娘们漫步，时间已经够久的了。他明白那些朋友对他意味着什么，他也了解那些姑娘。生活阅历已使他的心对这个世界充满怨愤。不过希望并没有全都弃他而去。吃过东西之后，他感觉比先前好多了，不再那么厌倦他的生活，精神上也不再那么颓唐。他或许也可以在某个安适的角落安定下来幸福地生活，如果他能碰到某个手头有点现钱的纯朴好姑娘的话。","He spoke roughly in order to belie his air of gentility for his entry had been followed by a pause of talk.His face was heated.To appear natural he pushed his cap back on his head and planted his elbows on the table.The mechanic and the two work-girls examined him point by point before resuming their conversation in a subdued voice.The girl brought him a plate of grocer’s hot peas, seasoned with pepper and vinegar, a fork and his ginger beer.He ate his food greedily and found it so good that he made a note of the shop mentally.When he had eaten all the peas he sipped his ginger beer and sat for some time thinking of Corley’s adventure.In his imagination he beheld the pair of lovers walking along some dark road; he heard Corley’s voice in deep energetic gallantries and saw again the leer of the young woman’s mouth.This vision made him feel keenly his own poverty of purse and spirit.He was tired of knocking about, of pulling the devil by the tail, of shifts and intrigues.He would be thirty-one in November.Would he never get a good job?Would he never have a home of his own?He thought how pleasant it would be to have a warm fire to sit by and a good dinner to sit down to.He had walked the streets long enough with friends and with girls.He knew what those friends were worth: he knew the girls too.Experience had embittered his heart against the world.But all hope had not left him.He felt better after having eaten than he had felt before, less weary of his life, less vanquished in spirit.He might yet be able to settle down in some snug corner and live happily if he could only come across some good simple-minded girl with a little of the ready."
"他付了两个半便士给那个邋里邋遢的女招待，然后走出那家店铺，又开始了他的游荡。他走进凯珀尔街，朝市政厅走去。然后他拐到了戴姆街上。在乔治街拐角，他遇见两个朋友，便停下来和他们说话。他很高兴他可以从漫长的闲逛中歇息片刻。朋友们问他是否见过科利，最近过得怎么样。他回答说他一白天都和科利在一起。他的朋友们说得很少。他们茫然地目送着人群中的某些身影，偶尔才会评说上一两句。其中一个朋友说一小时前他在威斯特摩兰街见过麦克。听到这个，雷尼汉说他前一天晚上就是和麦克一起呆在伊根的酒馆里。在威斯特摩兰街见过麦克的那个年轻人问麦克是不是真的在一场台球比赛中赢了点钱。雷尼汉并不知情：他说在伊根酒馆里是霍洛汉请他们喝的酒。","He paid twopence halfpenny to the slatternly girl and went out of the shop to begin his wandering again.He went into Capel Street and walked along towards the City Hall.Then he turned into Dame Street. At the corner of George’s Street he met two friends of his and stopped to converse with them.He was glad that he could rest from all his walking.His friends asked him had he seen Corley and what was the latest.He replied that he had spent the day with Corley.His friends talked very little.They looked vacantly after some figures in the crowd and sometimes made a critical remark.One said that he had seen Mac an hour before in Westmoreland Street.At this Lenehan said that he had been with Mac the night before in Egan’s.The young man who had seen Mac in Westmoreland Street asked was it true that Mac had won a bit over a billiard match.Lenehan did not know: he said that Holohan had stood them drinks in Egan’s."
"差一刻十点的时候，他离开那两个朋友走上了乔治街。在市集那里他向左一拐，然后走进了格拉夫顿街。姑娘们和小伙子们结成的人群已变得稀疏起来，沿街一路走过，他听到许多成群成对的人在互道晚安。他一直走到了外科医师学院的大钟附近：它正在敲十点钟。他开始沿着绿地的北侧快速地赶路，生怕科利会回来得太早。当他到达梅里恩街拐角的时候，他站到了一盏路灯的阴影里，从一直攒着的香烟里抽出一支，然后点着了它。他倚靠着灯柱，目光凝视着他期待能看到科利和那个年轻女子回来的方向。","He left his friends at a quarter to ten and went up George’s Street.He turned to the left at the City Markets and walked on into Grafton Street.The crowd of girls and young men had thinned and on his way up the street he heard many groups and couples bidding one another good-night.He went as far as the clock of the College of Surgeons: it was on the stroke of ten.He set off briskly along the northern side of the Green hurrying for fear Corley should return too soon.When he reached the corner of Merrion Street he took his stand in the shadow of a lamp and brought out one of the cigarettes which he had reserved and lit it.He leaned against the lamp-post and kept his gaze fixed on the part from which he expected to see Corley and the young woman return."
"他的思维又变得活跃起来。他想知道科利是否做成了这事。他想知道他是否已经问过她了或者他打算留到最后。他经受着他朋友的处境中所有的痛苦和喜悦，也经受着自己处境中的这一切。不过想到科利那慢慢转动的脑袋多少让他平静了下来：他确信科利肯定会做成这件事的。突然一个念头闪过他的脑海：也许科利已经从另一条路送她回家而甩掉了他。他的眼睛在街道上搜寻着：没有他们的身影。然而从他看到外科医师学院的大钟到现在，时间肯定有半小时了。科利会干这种事吗？他点着了最后一支烟，开始不安地吸了起来。他竭尽目力地盯着每一辆远远地停靠在广场一角的电车。他们肯定已经从另一条路回家了。烟纸裂开了，他骂了一声把它扔到了马路上。","His mind became active again.He wondered had Corley managed it successfully.He wondered if he had asked her yet or if he would leave it to the last.He suffered all the pangs and thrills of his friend’s situation as well as those of his own.But the memory of Corley’s slowly revolving head calmed him somewhat: he was sure Corley would pull it off all right.All at once the idea struck him that perhaps Corley had seen her home by another way and given him the slip.His eyes searched the street: there was no sign of them.Yet it was surely half-an-hour since he had seen the clock of the College of Surgeons.Would Corley do a thing like that?He lit his last cigarette and began to smoke it nervously.He strained his eyes as each tram stopped at the far corner of the square.They must have gone home by another way.The paper of his cigarette broke and he flung it into the road with a curse."
"突然，他看到他们朝他走来。他高兴地为之一振，然后紧靠着灯柱，努力从他们的步态中解读着结果。他们走得很快，年轻女子迈着迅疾的小碎步，科利则跟在她的身旁，迈着大步。他们似乎没有在说话。一种暗示的结果仿佛一种锐器的尖头一般刺痛了他。他知道科利会失手的；他知道事情不会有任何进展。","Suddenly he saw them coming towards him.He started with delight and keeping close to his lamp-post tried to read the result in their walk.They were walking quickly, the young woman taking quick short steps, while Corley kept beside her with his long stride.They did not seem to be speaking.An intimation of the result pricked him like the point of a sharp instrument.He knew Corley would fail; he knew it was no go."
"他们转向了巴戈特街，他立刻走上另一侧的人行道跟在他们身后。他们停下来，他也停下来，他们交谈了片刻，然后年轻女子走下台阶进了一栋房子的宅区。科利还站在路边，离门前的台阶有点距离。几分钟过去了。随后厅门被慢慢地、谨慎地打开了。一个女人跑下门前台阶，咳嗽了起来。科利转身朝她走了过去。他那宽阔的身躯挡住她的身体有好几秒钟，然后才又看到她跑上了台阶。门在她身后关上了，科利开始快步朝斯蒂芬绿地走去。","They turned down Baggot Street and he followed them at once, taking the other footpath.When they stopped he stopped too.They talked for a few moments and then the young woman went down the steps into the area of a house.Corley remained standing at the edge of the path, a little distance from the front steps.Some minutes passed.Then the hall-door was opened slowly and cautiously.A woman came running down the front steps and coughed.Corley turned and went towards her.His broad figure hid hers from view for a few seconds and then she reappeared running up the steps.The door closed on her and Corley began to walk swiftly towards Stephen’s Green."
"雷尼汉也朝同一个方向赶去。有几滴小雨点落了下来。他认为这是一种警示，他回头瞅了瞅年轻女子刚刚进去的那栋房子，确定他没有被注意到，随后他急切地跑过马路。焦急的心情和飞快的步伐使他气喘吁吁。他喊了起来：","Lenehan hurried on in the same direction.Some drops of light rain fell.He took them as a warning and, glancing back towards the house which the young woman had entered to see that he was not observed, he ran eagerly across the road.Anxiety and his swift run made him pant.He called out:"
"“喂，科利！”","“Hallo, Corley!”"
"科利转过头看看是谁在叫他，然后又继续像刚才那样往前走。雷尼汉跑着追赶他，一只手整理着肩上的雨衣。","Corley turned his head to see who had called him, and then continued walking as before.Lenehan ran after him, settling the waterproof on his shoulders with one hand."
"“喂，科利！”他又喊道。","“Hallo, Corley!” he cried again."
"他追上了他的朋友，关切地看着他的脸。从那脸上他什么都看不出来。","He came level with his friend and looked keenly in his face.He could see nothing there."
"“怎么样？”他说，“事成了吗？”","“Well?” he said.“Did it come off?”"
"他们已经走到了伊利广场的一角。可科利依然没有应答，他向左一拐，走进了旁边的那条小街。他面色镇定，表情严肃。雷尼汉和他的朋友并排走着，不安地喘着气。他迷惑不解，一种威胁的语调从他声音中透出来：","They had reached the corner of Ely Place.Still without answering, Corley swerved to the left and went up the side street.His features were composed in stern calm.Lenehan kept up with his friend, breathing uneasily.He was baffled and a note of menace pierced through his voice."
"“你就不能给咱们说说吗？”他说，“你试探过她了吗？”","“Can’t you tell us?” he said.“Did you try her?”"
"科利在第一盏路灯旁止住了脚步，神情严峻地瞪着他的前方。然后用一种庄严的手势，他朝着亮光伸出了一只手，微笑着，在他的追随者的注视下慢慢张开了手掌。一小枚金币在掌中闪闪发亮。","Corley halted at the first lamp and stared grimly before him.Then with a grave gesture he extended a hand towards the light and, smiling, opened it slowly to the gaze of his disciple.A small gold coin shone in the palm."
"第七章 寄宿公寓","CHAPTER 7 THE BOARDING HOUSE"
"穆尼太太是一个肉店老板的女儿。她是一个很能藏住心事的女人：一个坚毅的女人。她嫁给了父亲店里的领班，在春园附近开了一家肉店。但是岳父一死，穆尼先生就开始堕落了。他酗酒，扫空钱屉里的钱，很快就陷入重重债务。让他发誓戒酒根本没用：几天之后他肯定又会故态复萌。他当着顾客的面和妻子打架，还卖劣质肉，由此他毁了自己的生意。一天晚上，他拿切肉刀去砍他的妻子，使她不得已睡在了一个邻居家。","MRS. MOONEY was a butcher’ daughter.She was a woman who was quite able to keep things to herself: a determined woman.She had married her father’s foreman and opened a butcher’s shop near Spring Gardens.But as soon as his father-in-law was dead Mr. Mooney began to go to the devil.He drank, plundered the till, ran headlong into debt.It was no use making him take the pledge: he was sure to break out again a few days after.By fighting his wife in the presence of customers and by buying bad meat he ruined his business.One night he went for his wife with the cleaver and she had to sleep a neighbour’s house."
"打那以后，他们就分开住了。她到神父那里获准与他离婚，并获得了孩子们的抚养权。她不给他钱，也不管他的食宿；于是他被迫应征当了一名治安员。他是一个衣衫褴褛、弯腰弓背的小个子酒鬼，一张白脸，一撮白色的小胡子，小眼睛上方的眉毛倒是用笔描黑了，他那眼睛红肿着，布满血丝；一天到头他都坐在执行官的屋子里，等着被分派任务。而穆尼太太则是个大块头的女人，仪表堂堂。她用卖肉剩余的钱，在哈德威克街上开了一家提供膳食的寄宿公寓。她的公寓有一些流动住客，主要是来自利物浦和马恩岛的游客，偶尔也有些来自歌舞杂耍戏院的艺人。而常住房客则是由来自城里的公司职员组成。她精明而稳定地管理着这家公寓，知道何时可以赊账，何时必须严厉以及何时又大可不必计较。所有常住的年轻小伙子都称她为“夫人”。","After that they lived apart.She went to the priest and got a separation from him with care of the children.She would give him neither money nor food nor house-room; and so he was obliged to enlist himself as a sheriff’man.He was a shabby stooped little drunkard with a white face and a white moustache white eyebrows, pencilled above his little eyes, which were veined and raw; and all day long he sat in the bailiff’s room, waiting to be put on a job.Mrs. Mooney, who had taken what remained of her money out of the butcher business and set up a boarding house in Hardwicke Street, was a big imposing woman.Her house had a floating population made up of tourists from Liverpool and the Isle of Man and, occasionally, artistes from the music halls.Its resident population was made up of clerks from the city.She governed the house cunningly and firmly, knew when to give credit, when to be stern and when to let things pass.All the resident young men spoke of her as The Madam."
"穆尼太太留宿的年轻小伙子们每周支付十五先令用于伙食和住宿（正餐上的啤酒或黑啤酒不包括在内）。他们有着共同的趣味和职业，因为这个原因，他们相互之间非常友好。他们常常彼此探讨谁可能成为同好，谁又可能是外人。杰克·穆尼——夫人的儿子——在舰队街上给一个代销商办事，是一个出了名的难以管教的人。他喜欢说大兵们常说的那种粗话，通常总是在凌晨才回家。当他遇见朋友们的时候，他总有一桩好事告诉他们，而他也总是知道这样的好事——比如一匹可能取胜的马或者一个颇有潜力的艺人。他还很会玩棒球，唱滑稽歌曲。每逢星期天晚上穆尼太太家的前厅常常会有联谊聚会。综艺剧场的艺人们会应邀前来表演节目；谢里登则演奏华尔兹、波尔卡以及即兴的伴奏乐曲。波利·穆尼——夫人的女儿——也会为大家唱歌。她唱道：","Mrs. Mooney’s young men paid fifteen shillings a week for board and lodgings (beer or stout at dinner excluded).They shared in common tastes and occupations and for this reason they were very chummy with one another.They discussed with one another the chances of favourites and outsiders.Jack Mooney, the Madam’s son, who was clerk to a commission agent in Fleet Street, had the reputation of being a hard case.He was fond of using soldiers’ obscenities: usually he came home in the small hours.When he met his friends he had always a good one to tell them and he was always sure to be on to a good thing—that is to say, a likely horse or a likely artiste.He was also handy with the mitts and sang comic songs.On Sunday nights there would often be a reunion in Mrs. Mooney’s front drawing-room.The music-hall artistes would oblige; and Sheridan played waltzes and polkas and vamped accompaniments.Polly Mooney, the Madam’s daughter, would also sing.She sang:"
"我是一个……顽皮的女孩。你无需假装不知：你知道我就是如此。","I’m a... naughty girl.You needn’t sham: You know I am."
"波利是一个十九岁的苗条姑娘，她长着浅色柔软的头发，还有一张丰满的小嘴。当她和别人说话时，她那双灰中带绿的眼睛总习惯于朝上看，这使得她看上去就像是个不近情理的姑娘。穆尼太太起初让女儿去一家谷物商的办事处当打字员，可是那个名声不好的治安员隔一天就会到那家办公室来，请求获准和他的女儿说话，于是她又把女儿领回了家，安排她去做家务。因为波利生性非常活泼，这样安排是想要让她多接触接触那些小伙子。再说年轻小伙子们也喜欢有个年轻女人在自己身边。波利自然和这些小伙子们打情骂俏，不过穆尼太太是个精明的法官，她明白年轻人们只不过是在打发时间：没有一个是认真的。这种情形持续了好长一段时间，当穆尼太太注意到波利和其中一个年轻人之间有点进展的时候，她又开始想让波利重新回去干打字的活。她留意着这一对，不动声色。","Polly was a slim girl of nineteen; she had light soft hair and a small full mouth.Her eyes, which were grey with a shade of green through them, had a habit of glancing upwards when she spoke with anyone, which made her look like a little perverse madonna.Mrs. Mooney had first sent her daughter to be a typist in a corn-factor’s office but, as a disreputable sheriff’s man used to come every other day to the office, asking to be allowed to say a word to his daughter, she had taken her daughter home again and set her to do housework.As Polly was very lively the intention was to give her the run of the young men.Besides young men like to feel that there is a young woman not very far away.Polly, of course, flirted with the young men but Mrs. Mooney, who was a shrewd judge, knew that the young men were only passing the time away: none of them meant business.Things went on so for a long time and Mrs. Mooney began to think of sending Polly back to typewriting when she noticed that something was going on between Polly and one of the young men.She watched the pair and kept her own counsel."
"波利知道自己在被监视，不过她母亲一直保持沉默，其用意是明白无误的。母女之间没有任何公开的合谋，没有任何公开的协议，尽管公寓里的人都开始谈论这桩绯闻，穆尼太太却依然没有干预。波利的行为举止开始变得有些古怪，而那个小伙子也很明显心神不安。终于，当她断定时机合适的时候，穆尼太太干预了。她处理起道德问题来犹如快刀砍肉：在这件事情上，她早已打定了主意。","Polly knew that she was being watched, but still her mother’s persistent silence could not be misunderstood.There had been no open complicity between mother and daughter, no open understanding but, though people in the house began to talk of the affair, still Mrs. Mooney did not intervene.Polly began to grow a little strange in her manner and the young man was evidently perturbed.At last, when she judged it to be the right moment, Mrs. Mooney intervened.She dealt with moral problems as a cleaver deals with meat: and in this case she had made up her mind."
"那是初夏时节一个明媚的星期天早晨，天气有变热的迹象，但仍有一股凉爽的清风在吹拂。寄宿公寓的所有窗户都开着，蕾丝镶边的窗帘在推上去的窗格下面朝街道的方向轻轻鼓起飘扬着。乔治教堂的钟楼传出连续的钟鸣声，做礼拜的人或独自一人或成群结队地穿过教堂前面的圆形小广场，他们举止持重，戴着手套的手里拿着袖珍读本，这两点都揭示了他们的目的。寄宿公寓里的早餐已经结束，早餐室的桌子上放满了盘子，盘子上残留着一道道黄色的蛋痕，还有少量熏肉的肥肉末和肉皮渣。穆尼太太坐在藤编扶手椅里，看着女仆玛丽撤掉早餐餐具。 她吩咐玛丽把弄碎了的面包皮和面包块收集起来，留着用来做星期二的面包布丁。在桌子收拾干净、碎面包收集完毕、放糖和黄油的橱柜也都上了锁之后，她开始重温前一天晚上和波利的谈话。事情正如她所料：她很坦诚地发问，波利也很坦诚地作答。当然，两人多少都有点尴尬。她尴尬是因为她不想用太过轻漫的态度来接受这个事实或者让人觉得她已经默许了这件事，而波利尴尬则不仅仅因为提到这种事总会让她尴尬，而且还因为她不想让人以为，凭着自己的单纯和聪明，她已经猜出了母亲宽容背后的意图。","It was a bright Sunday morning of early summer, promising heat, but with a fresh breeze blowing.All the windows of the boarding house were open and the lace curtains ballooned gently towards the street beneath the raised sashes.The belfry of George’s Church sent out constant peals and worshippers, singly or in groups, traversed the little circus before the church, revealing their purpose by their self-contained demeanour no less than by the little volumes in their gloved hands.Breakfast was over in the boarding house and the table of the breakfast-room was covered with plates on which lay yellow streaks of eggs with morsels of bacon-fat and bacon-rind.Mrs. Mooney sat in the straw arm-chair and watched the servant Mary remove the breakfast things.She made Mary collect the crusts and pieces of broken bread to help to make Tuesday’s bread-pudding.When the table was cleared, the broken bread collected, the sugar and butter safe under lock and key, she began to reconstruct the interview which she had had the night before with Polly.Things were as she had suspected: she had been frank in her questions and Polly had been frank in her answers.Both had been somewhat awkward, of course.She had been made awkward by her not wishing to receive the news in too cavalier a fashion or to seem to have connived and Polly had been made awkward not merely because allusions of that kind always made her awkward but also because she did not wish it to be thought that in her wise innocence she had divined the intention behind her mother’s tolerance."
"穆尼太太本能地瞥了一眼壁炉架上的那座镀金小钟，因为她一下子在沉思中意识到乔治教堂的钟声已经停止鸣响了。时间是十一点过十七分：她有充裕的时间跟多兰先生谈这件事，然后还能在十二点钟以前赶到马尔伯勒街。她确信自己会赢。首先所有社会舆论的分量都倒向她这一边：她现在是一位震怒的母亲。她允许他住在她的房子里，本以为他是个品德高尚的人，而他却完全辜负了她的盛情好客。他大概三十四五岁，因此年轻不能再当作是借口；而无知也不能当作借口，因为他是个多少已经见过世面的男人。他就是利用了波利的少不更事：这一点是很明显的。问题是：他将做出怎样的补偿？","Mrs. Mooney glanced instinctively at the little gilt clock on the mantelpiece as soon as she had become aware through her revery that the bells of George’s Church had stopped ringing.It was seventeen minutes past eleven: she would have lots of time to have the matter out with Mr. Doran and then catch short twelve at Marlborough Street.She was sure she would win. To begin with she had all the weight of social opinion on her side: she was an outraged mother.She had allowed him to live beneath her roof, assuming that he was a man of honour and he had simply abused her hospitality.He was thirty-four or thirty-five years of age, so that youth could not be pleaded as his excuse; nor could ignorance be his excuse since he was a man who had seen something of the world.He had simply taken advantage of Polly’s youth and inexperience: that was evident.The question was: What reparation would he make?"
"在这种情况下必须得有补偿。对于男人来说，一切都再好不过了：在享受了欢愉时刻之后，他可以一走了之，仿佛什么事都没发生过，而女孩则不得不去面对严厉的指责。有些当母亲的会满足于要一笔钱来摆平这种事；她听说过好多这种做法。但是她不愿意这样做。对她来说，只有一种办法可以弥补女儿荣誉的损失：结婚。她再次数了数自己心里的牌，然后才打发玛丽上去到多兰先生的房间说她希望和他谈一谈。她确信自己会赢。他是个严肃的年轻人，不像其他人那样放荡不羁、粗声粗气。如果换成是谢里登先生或者米德先生甚或是班塔姆·莱昂斯的话，她的任务将会艰巨得多。她觉得他并不愿意弄得尽人皆知。公寓里的所有住客都对这件事有所耳闻；有些人还编造了些细节。再者，他在一个信奉天主教的大酒商的办事处工作已经有十三个年头，公开这件事对他来说也许会意味着丢掉这份差事。而如果他同意的话，一切就会平安无事。她知道他有一份不错的收入，而且她怀疑他还有些积蓄。","There must be reparation made in such case.It is all very well for the man: he can go his ways as if nothing had happened, having had his moment of pleasure, but the girl has to bear the brunt.Some mothers would be content to patch up such an affair for a sum of money; she had known cases of it. But she would not do so. For her only one reparation could make up for the loss of her daughter’s honour: marriage.She counted all her cards again before sending Mary up to Doran’s room to say that she wished to speak with him.She felt sure she would win. He was a serious young man, not rakish or loud-voiced like the others.If it had been Mr. Sheridan or Mr. Meade or Bantam Lyons her task would have been much harder.She did not think he would face publicity.All the lodgers in the house knew something of the affair; details had been invented by some.Besides, he had been employed for thirteen years in a great Catholic wine-merchant’s office and publicity would mean for him, perhaps, the loss of his job. Whereas if he agreed all might be well.She knew he had a good screw for one thing and she suspected he had a bit of stuff put by."
"快半点钟了！她站起身来，在两个窗户中间墙上的穿衣镜里打量了一下自己。她脸色红润，神情坚毅，这让她感到满意，她想起了她认识的有些母亲就是无法把自己的女儿脱手嫁出去。","Nearly the half-hour!She stood up and surveyed herself in the pier-glass.The decisive expression of her great florid face satisfied her and she thought of some mothers she knew who could not get their daughters off their hands."
"这个星期天早上，多兰先生着实非常焦虑。他曾两次试图刮脸，但他的手抖得厉害，使他只好作罢。长了三天的有点发红的胡须蓄满了下巴，每隔两三分钟，雾气就会聚集在他的眼镜片上，使他不得不摘下眼镜，用手帕去擦拭。一想起头天晚上他所做的忏悔，他就会感到切肤的痛苦；神父了解了这件事的每一个荒谬的细节，最后还夸大了他的罪行，以至于当他面对补救的机会时几乎可以说是心存感激了。伤害已成事实。现在除了和她结婚或者溜之大吉，他还能做什么呢？他无法厚颜以对。这件事肯定会被人议论，他的雇主也肯定会有所耳闻。都柏林这么一个小城市：人人都知道别人的事情。他感到心就在喉咙里热切地跳动，在他那兴奋的想象中，他仿佛听到了老伦纳德先生在用刺耳的嗓音喊：“请多兰先生到这里来。”多年来的恪尽职守什么都没换来！所有的进取与勤奋也都横遭毁弃！当然了，作为一个年轻人，他也曾纵情寻欢；在酒馆里，他曾在同伴面前吹嘘过自己的自由思想，否认过上帝的存在。可是那都已经过去，全都结束了……差不多。他每周仍然会买一份《雷诺兹报》，但他也履行自己的宗教职责，一年中十分之九的时间他都过着循规蹈矩的生活。他有足够的钱安顿下来；问题不在于此。而在于他们家人会看不起她。首先是她那声名狼藉的父亲，其次是她母亲的寄宿公寓也开始名声不好了。他觉察到自己正在被套牢。他能想象得到朋友们谈论这件事并放声大笑的情景。她有点粗俗；有时她会说“我看见到”和“要是我已经已经知道“。可是如果他真爱她的话，语法又有什么要紧的呢？为她所做的事情，他是该去爱她还是该鄙视她，他无法做出决定。当然，他已经做出了决定。他的本能在敦促他保持自由，不要结婚。它在说：一旦你结婚了，你就完了。","Mr. Doran was very anxious indeed this Sunday morning.He had made two attempts to shave but his hand had been so unsteady that he had been obliged to desist.Three days’ reddish beard fringed his jaws and every two or three minutes a mist gathered on his glasses so that he had to take them off and polish them with his pocket-handkerchief.The recollection of his confession of the night before was a cause of acute pain to him; the priest had drawn out every ridiculous detail of the affair and in the end had so magnified his sin that he was almost thankful at being afforded a loophole of reparation.The harm was done.What could he do now but marry her or run away?He could not brazen it out.The affair would be sure to be talked of and his employer would be certain to hear of it.Dublin is such a small city: everyone knows everyone else’s business.He felt his heart leap warmly in his throat as he heard in his excited imagination old Mr. Leonard calling out in his rasping voice: “Send Mr. Doran here, please.”All his long years of service gone for nothing!All his industry and diligence thrown away!As a young man he had sown his wild oats, of course; he had boasted of his free-thinking and denied the existence of God to his companions in public-houses.But that was all passed and done with... nearly. He still bought a copy of Reynolds’s Newspaper every week but he attended to his religious duties and for nine-tenths of the year lived a regular life.He had money enough to settle down on; it was not that.But the family would look down on her.First of all there was her disreputable father and then her mother’s boarding house was beginning to get a certain fame.He had a notion that he was being had.He could imagine his friends talking of the affair and laughing.She was a little vulgar; some times she said “I seen” and “If I had’ve known.” But what would grammar matter if he really loved her?He could not make up his mind whether to like her or despise her for what she had done.Of course he had done it too.His instinct urged him to remain free, not to marry.Once you are married you are done for, it said."
"他穿着衬衫和长裤无助地坐在床边，这时她轻敲他的房门，走了进来。她告诉了他一切：她已经向母亲坦承了这件事，她的母亲会在那天早晨和他谈话。她哭泣着，搂住他的脖子说道：","While he was sitting helplessly on the side of the bed in shirt and trousers she tapped lightly at his door and entered.She told him all, that she had made a clean breast of it to her mother and that her mother would speak with him that morning.She cried and threw her arms round his neck, saying:"
"“哦，鲍勃！鲍勃！我该怎么办？我到底该怎么办？”","“O Bob!Bob!What am I to do?What am I to do at all?”"
"她说，她想一死了之。","She would put an end to herself, she said."
"他无力地安慰着她，叫她别哭，一切都会好的，不要害怕。她的胸脯贴在他的衬衫上，他能感觉到她的焦虑。","He comforted her feebly, telling her not to cry, that it would be all right, never fear.He felt against his shirt the agitation of her bosom."
"发生这样的事，其实并不全是他的错。凭着单身汉奇特而耐久的好记性，他清楚地记得她的衣裙、她的呼吸和她的手指最初所给予他的那些不经意的触摸。后来有一天晚上很晚的时候，他正要脱衣睡觉，她怯生生地叩响了他的房门。她想用的他的蜡烛重新点燃一下她的蜡烛，因为刚刚一股风把她的蜡烛给吹灭了。那天晚上她正好洗澡。她穿一件宽松敞口的印花法兰绒精梳外衣。她那白皙的脚背在她那毛绒拖鞋的开口处闪着亮光，在她那芳香的皮肤下面血液散发着温热。她的双手和手腕在她点燃并摆正蜡烛的时候也散发出一股淡淡的香气。","It was not altogether his fault that it had happened.He remembered well, with the curious patient memory of the celibate, the first casual caresses her dress, her breath, her fingers had given him.Then late one night as he was undressing for she had tapped at his door, timidly.She wanted to relight her candle at his for hers had been blown out by a gust.It was her bath night.She wore a loose open combing-jacket of printed flannel.Her white instep shone in the opening of her furry slippers and the blood glowed warmly behind her perfumed skin.From her hands and wrists too as she lit and steadied her candle a faint perfume arose."
"每次他深夜晚归的时候，正是她为他热饭热菜。因为知道她独自呆在自己身旁，所以他几乎品尝不出食物的味道。夜深人静，整栋公寓都已入睡。她是多么会体贴别人啊！要是遇上夜晚天气寒冷，或者下雨刮风，那她必定还会为他准备一小杯潘趣酒。或许他们在一起生活也会是幸福的……","On nights when he came in very late it was she who warmed up his dinner.He scarcely knew what he was eating feeling her beside him alone, at night, in the sleeping house.And her thoughtfulness!If the night was anyway cold or wet or windy there was sure to be a little tumbler of punch ready for him.Perhaps they could be happy together...."
"他们曾常常一起踮脚上楼，每人手里拿一根蜡烛，然后在第三个楼梯平台处难舍难分地互道晚安。他们曾常常接吻。他清楚地记着她的眼睛，她那只手的触摸以及他的如痴如狂……","They used to go upstairs together on tiptoe, each with a candle, and on the third landing exchange reluctant goodnights.They used to kiss.He remembered well her eyes, the touch of her hand and his delirium...."
"可如今痴狂已去。他重复着她的话，却是在问自己：“我该怎么办？”单身汉的本能警告他应知趣而退。可是罪孽已经犯下；即使是他自己的道德感也在告诉他对于这样的罪孽必须要作出补偿。","But delirium passes.He echoed her phrase, applying it to himself: “What am I to do?” The instinct of the celibate warned him to hold back.But the sin was there; even his sense of honour told him that reparation must be made for such a sin."
"当他和她正坐在床边，玛丽来到门口说太太想在客厅里见他。他起身穿上背心和外套，感觉比任何时候都更加无助。不过在他穿戴好之后，他仍走过去安慰她。一切都会好的，不必害怕。然后他走开了，任由她在床上哭泣，轻声哀叹：“哦，我的上帝！”","While he was sitting with her on the side of the bed Mary came to the door and said that the missus wanted to see him in the parlour.He stood up to put on his coat and waistcoat, more helpless than ever.When he was dressed he went over to her to comfort her.It would be all right, never fear.He left her crying on the bed and moaning softly: “O my God!”"
"下楼梯的时候，他的眼镜片由于雾气而变得模糊起来，他只好摘下来擦拭。他真巴不得腾身而起穿过屋顶，飞到另一个国度，在那里他将再也听不到他的这些麻烦事，然而有一种力量却推着他一步一步朝楼下走去。他的雇主和夫人那两张绝不容情的脸盯视着他那副尴尬窘迫的样子。在最后一段楼梯上，他与杰克·穆尼擦身而过，杰克刚从食品贮藏室拿了两瓶巴斯牌麦芽酒，小心翼翼地抱着往楼上走。他们冷冷地相互致意；那位情人的眼睛在那张笨重的牛头犬似的大脸和那对粗短的胳膊上停留了一两秒钟。当他走到楼梯底下的时候，他抬头往上瞥了一眼，看到杰克正站在小回房的门口注视着他。","Going down the stairs his glasses became so dimmed with moisture that he had to take them off and polish them.He longed to ascend through the roof and fly away to another country where he would never hear again of his trouble, and yet a force pushed him downstairs step by step.The implacable faces of his employer and of the Madam stared upon his discomfiture.On the last flight of stairs he passed Jack Mooney who was coming up from the pantry nursing two bottles of Bass.They saluted coldly; and the lover’s eyes rested for a second or two on a thick bulldog face and a pair of thick short arms.When he reached the foot of the staircase he glanced up and saw Jack regarding him from the door of the return-room."
"猛然间他记起了那个晚上。当时，来自歌舞杂耍场的艺人中有一个头发金黄的小个子伦敦人曾经相当轻佻地提到波利。那次聚会也因为杰克对此暴跳如雷而差点中断。大家都极力让他安静下来。那个杂耍场艺人，脸色比平常显得更加苍白，一直笑着解释说他没有任何恶意：可是杰克却不停地冲着他大声喊叫，说如果有谁想要在他妹妹身上玩这种把戏，他绝对会打掉他的牙齿让他咽下去，他一定会这样做。","Suddenly he remembered the night when one of the music-hall artistes, a little blond Londoner, had made a rather free allusion to Polly.The reunion had been almost broken up on account of Jack’s violence.Everyone tried to quiet him.The music-hall artiste, a little paler than usual, kept smiling and saying that there was no harm meant: but Jack kept shouting at him that if any fellow tried that sort of a game on with his sister he’d bloody well put his teeth down his throat, so he would."
"波利坐在床边哭了一小会儿。然后她擦干眼泪，走到穿衣镜前面。她把毛巾的一角放在水罐里蘸了蘸，然后用凉水去擦拭眼睛以便重新振作起来。她侧身照着镜子，重新调整了一下耳朵上方的一个发卡。然后她又回到床边，在床脚处坐了下来。她盯着那对枕头看了好久，它们唤醒了她脑海中那些秘密而温馨的回忆。她把后脖颈倚靠在冰凉的铁床栏上，陷入了遐思。她的脸上不再有任何烦扰的神情。","Polly sat for a little time on the side of the bed, crying.Then she dried her eyes and went over to the looking-glass.She dipped the end of the towel in the water-jug and refreshed her eyes with the cool water.She looked at herself in profile and readjusted a hairpin above her ear.Then she went back to the bed again and sat at the foot.She regarded the pillows for a long time and the sight of them awakened in her mind secret, amiable memories.She rested the nape of her neck against the cool iron bed-rail and fell into a reverie.There was no longer any perturbation visible on her face."
"她耐心地等待着，几乎可以说是满心喜悦，毫不惊慌。她的回忆渐渐让位于对未来的希望和憧憬。她的希望和憧憬是如此错综复杂，以至于她不再能看到她的目光盯视着的那对白色枕头，也记不清自己在等待什么了。","She waited on patiently, almost cheerfully, without alarm, her memories gradually giving place to hopes and visions of the future.Her hopes and visions were so intricate that she no longer saw the white pillows on which her gaze was fixed or remembered that she was waiting for anything."
"终于，她听到母亲在叫。她纵身而起，跑到了楼梯扶手旁边。","At last she heard her mother calling.She started to her feet and ran to the banisters."
"“波利！波利！”“怎么了，妈妈？”","“Polly!Polly!”“Yes, mamma?”"
"“下来吧，亲爱的。多兰先生想和你说话。”","“Come down, dear.Mr. Doran wants to speak to you.”"
"那一刻，她想起了自己一直在等待什么。","Then she remembered what she had been waiting for."
"第八章 小云朵","CHAPTER 8 A LITTLE CLOUD"
"八年前，他在北墙车站送别了他的朋友并祝他好运。加拉赫的确事业有成了。你可以立刻看出这一点：他那游历甚广的神气，他那精心剪裁的粗呢西装，以及那无所畏惧的口气。很少有人拥有像他那样的才华，更少有人能像他那样不被成功冲昏了头脑。加拉赫心地正直，他应该获得成功。有他这样的一位朋友真是一件值得炫耀的事情。","EIGHT years before he had seen his friend off at the North Wall and wished him godspeed.Gallaher had got on. You could tell that at once by his travelled air, his well-cut tweed suit, and fearless accent.Few fellows had talents like his and fewer still could remain unspoiled by such success.Gallaher’s heart was in the right place and he had deserved to win. It was something to have a friend like that."
"从午饭时间开始，小钱德勒所想的一直都是他要和加拉赫见面，加拉赫的请柬以及加拉赫生活的那座大城市伦敦。他被叫做小钱德勒是因为尽管他的身材只是中等略偏低些，但是他给人的感觉却是一个小个子。他的双手又白又小，身板纤弱，嗓音平和，举止得体。他十分用心地梳理了他那柔软光洁的浅色发丝和胡须，还小心地在手绢上洒了些香水。他那半月形的指甲完美无缺，他笑起来的时候，你会瞥见一排孩子般洁白的牙齿。","Little Chandler’s thoughts ever since lunch-time had been of his meeting with Gallaher, of Gallaher’s invitation and of the great city London where Gallaher lived.He was called Little Chandler because, though he was but slightly under the average stature, he gave one the idea of being a little man. His hands were white and small, his frame was fragile, his voice was quiet and his manners were refined.He took the greatest care of his fair silken hair and moustache and used perfume discreetly on his handkerchief.The half-moons of his nails were perfect and when he smiled you caught a glimpse of a row of childish white teeth."
"当他坐在国王律师公会自己的办公桌旁时，他想到了这八年的时间所带来的变化。他所认识的那个曾经衣衫褴褛、穷困不堪的朋友已经成为伦敦新闻界的一个杰出人物。他常常从令人厌倦的写作中转移视线，向着办公室的窗外凝望。晚秋落日的余晖照耀着草坪和人行小道。它把一阵和煦的金色微尘洒落在不修边幅的护士们身上，也洒落在那些坐在长椅上打盹的垂垂老者的身上；它闪现在所有移动的身影上——沿着石子小路奔跑尖叫的孩子们以及穿行于公园里的每一个人。他注视着这一场景，想到了生活；然后（正如他一想到生活就总会发生的那样）他变得伤心起来。一种淡淡的忧郁占据了他。他感到与命运抗争是多么无用，这是岁月遗赠给他的一份智慧的烦恼。","As he sat at his desk in the King’s Inns he thought what changes those eight years had brought.The friend whom he had known under a shabby and necessitous guise had become a brilliant figure on the London Press.He turned often from his tiresome writing to gaze out of the office window.The glow of a late autumn sunset covered the grass plots and walks.It cast a shower of kindly golden dust on the untidy nurses and decrepit old men who drowsed on the benches; it flickered upon all the moving figures—on the children who ran screaming along the gravel paths and on everyone who passed through the gardens.He watched the scene and thought of life; and (as always happened when he thought of life) he became sad. A gentle melancholy took possession of him. He felt how useless it was to struggle against fortune, this being the burden of wisdom which the ages had bequeathed to him."
"他想起了家里书架上的那些诗集。它们是在他还是单身汉的时候买来的，许多夜晚，当他坐在门厅一侧的小房间里，他总忍不住想从书架上取一本下来，念点什么给他的妻子听。但是羞涩总是让他退缩不前；于是那些书就一直呆在了架子上。有时他会反复背诵一些诗句给自己听，这使他感到欣慰。","He remembered the books of poetry upon his shelves at home.He had bought them in his bachelor days and many an evening, as he sat in the little room off the hall, he had been tempted to take one down from the bookshelf and read out something to his wife.But shyness had always held him back; and so the books had remained on their shelves.At times he repeated lines to himself and this consoled him."
"他的时间到了，他起身离开办公桌，并中规中矩地和同事们告别。他出现在国王律师公会那带有封建特色的拱门之下，一副衣着整洁、神色谦和的样子，然后矫捷地沿着亨利埃塔街走去。晚霞的金辉开始消褪，空气也变得清冷起来。一群满身污垢的孩子出现在街道上。他们有的在马路上或站或跑，有的沿着敞开的房门前的台阶往上爬，有的则像老鼠一样蹲在门槛上。小钱德勒根本没有在意他们。他敏捷地择路而行，穿行在所有这些微小的害虫般的生命中间，行走在荒凉诡秘的宅邸的阴影之下。都柏林昔日的贵族曾经在那些房子里面喧嚣一时。对过去的任何回忆都没有触动他，因为他的脑子里盛满了一种现时的喜悦。","When his hour had struck he stood up and took leave of his desk and of his fellow-clerks punctiliously.He emerged from under the feudal arch of the King’s Inns, a neat modest figure, and walked swiftly down Henrietta Street.The golden sunset was waning and the air had grown sharp.A horde of grimy children populated the street.They stood or ran in the roadway or crawled up the steps before the gaping doors or squatted like mice upon the thresholds.Little Chandler gave them no thought.He picked his way deftly through all that minute vermin-like life and under the shadow of the gaunt spectral mansions in which the old nobility of Dublin had roystered.No memory of the past touched him, for his mind was full of a present joy."
"他从来没有去过科利斯酒店，不过他知道这名字的价值。他知道人们在看戏之后会去那里品尝牡蛎、喝甜酒；他还听说那里的侍者讲法语和德语。晚上快步经过那里的时候，他曾看到汽车停靠在门前，衣着富丽的女士们由殷勤的男士们陪伴着从车上下来，迅速走了进去。她们穿着华丽繁复的衣服，裹着好多条围巾。她们的脸上擦着粉，每当衣裙触地，她们就会往上提，一个个仿佛都像是受了惊的阿塔兰特公主。他总是路过那里而从不转头去看。他习惯在街上快步行走，即使是在白天；而每当他发觉自己在夜里很晚了还在城里，他就会满心忧虑、紧张不安地匆忙赶路。然而，有时那些让他害怕的缘由却是他自找的。他专挑那些最黑最窄的街道行走，当他大胆地往前走的时候，延展在他脚步周围的静寂让他感到不安，那些四处游荡一声不响的身影让他感到不安；有时，一下低沉急促的笑声会让他浑身颤抖得像片叶子。","He had never been in Corless’s but he knew the value of the name.He knew that people went there after the theatre to eat oysters and drink liqueurs; and he had heard that the waiters there spoke French and German.Walking swiftly by at night he had seen cabs drawn up before the door and richly dressed ladies, escorted by cavaliers, alight and enter quickly.They wore noisy dresses and many wraps.Their faces were powdered and they caught up their dresses, when they touched earth, like alarmed Atalantas.He had always passed without turning his head to look.It was his habit to walk swiftly in the street even by day and whenever he found himself in the city late at night he hurried on his way apprehensively and excitedly.Sometimes, however, he courted the causes of his fear.He chose the darkest and narrowest streets and, as he walked boldly forward, the silence that was spread about his footsteps troubled him, the wandering, silent figures troubled him; and at times a sound of low fugitive laughter made him tremble like a leaf."
"他往右一拐，朝坎珀尔街走去。伊格内休斯·加拉赫跻身于伦敦新闻界！八年前谁能想到这会成为可能呢？不过，当他回想过去，小钱德勒倒能够记起他朋友身上曾有过许多预示未来成就的迹象。人们过去常说伊格内休斯·加拉赫狂野不羁。当然了，那时他的确曾混迹于一帮混混之中，毫无节制地酗酒，还四下借钱。最后他卷入了某桩可能非法的事件之中，某宗金钱交易：至少，这是他之所以逃走的一种说法。但是任何人都无法否认他的才能。伊格内休斯·加拉赫身上总有某种……某种让你不由自主就会铭刻于心的东西。即使在他因为钱而捉襟见肘束手无策的时候，他也始终保持着无畏的神色。小钱德勒想起了（想到这里他的脸颊泛起了些微自豪的红晕）伊格内休斯·加拉赫在身处窘境时常说的一句话：","He turned to the right towards Capel Street.Ignatius Gallaher on the London Press!Who would have thought it possible eight years before?Still, now that he reviewed the past, Little Chandler could remember many signs of future greatness in his friend.People used to say that Ignatius Gallaher was wild. Of course, he did mix with a rakish set of fellows at that time, drank freely and borrowed money on all sides.In the end he had got mixed up in some shady affair, some money transaction: at least, that was one version of his flight.But nobody denied him talent.There was always a certain... something in Ignatius Gallaher that impressed you in spite of yourself.Even when he was out at elbows and at his wits’ end for money he kept up a bold face.Little Chandler remembered (and the remembrance brought a slight flush of pride to his cheek) one of Ignatius Gallaher’s sayings when he was in a tight corner:"
"“现在中场休息，孩子们，”他常常轻松愉快地说，“我的机灵帽去哪儿了呢？”","“Half time now, boys,” he used to say light-heartedly.“Where’s my considering cap?”"
"这就是百折不挠的伊格内休斯·加拉赫；该死的，就因为这一点，你也不得不敬佩他。","That was Ignatius Gallaher all out; and, damn it, you couldn’t but admire him for it."
"小钱德勒加快了步伐。有生以来第一次他感觉自己要比身边路过的人优越。第一次他的灵魂对坎珀尔街无趣的不雅产生反感。有一点是毫无疑问的：如果你想要成功，你就得离开。在都柏林你无法有所作为。当他经过格拉顿桥的时候，他顺着河水朝下游的码头望去，对那些破旧低矮的房屋心生怜悯。在他看来它们好似一帮流浪汉，沿着河岸簇拥在一起，破旧的外套上布满尘烟，它们被落日的景色惊呆了，等待着夜晚的第一丝寒意来召唤它们起身，振作，然后离开。他想知道他能否写一首诗来表达自己的想法。也许加拉赫还能帮他发表在伦敦的某家报纸上。他能写点什么新颖的东西吗？他不确定他想表达什么样的想法，不过一个充满诗意的时刻触动了他，这种感受在他心中就像一个新生的希望获得了生命。他迈步向前，勇气十足。","Little Chandler quickened his pace.For the first time in his life he felt himself superior to the people he passed.For the first time his soul revolted against the dull inelegance of Capel Street.There was no doubt about it: if you wanted to succeed you had to go away.You could do nothing in Dublin.As he crossed Grattan Bridge he looked down the river towards the lower quays and pitied the poor stunted houses.They seemed to him a band of tramps, huddled together along the riverbanks, their old coats covered with dust and soot, stupefied by the panorama of sunset and waiting for the first chill of night bid them arise, shake themselves and begone.He wondered whether he could write a poem to express his idea.Perhaps Gallaher might be able to get it into some London paper for him.Could he write something original?He was not sure what idea he wished to express but the thought that a poetic moment had touched him took life within him like an infant hope.He stepped onward bravely."
"每一步都让他更加接近伦敦，同时也更加远离他自己那种平淡庸俗的生活。一盏明灯开始在他心头的地平线上闪现。他还不老——刚三十二岁。他的性情可以说是刚刚成熟。还有那么多不同的情绪和印象，他真想用诗歌来表达。他感到它们就在自己的内心。他试图衡量自己的灵魂，看看它是否是一个诗人的灵魂。他认为，忧郁是他性情的基调，不过这是被重复出现的信念、顺从和单纯的快乐调和冲淡了的一种忧郁。如果他能在一本诗集中传达这种忧郁，也许人们会愿意倾听。他永远都不会受人追捧：他明白这一点。他无法撼动大众，但是他却可能吸引一小圈同道之人。英格兰的批评家们也许会认可他为凯尔特流派的一员，理由是他诗歌中的忧郁情调；此外，他还会引经据典。他的书还会引起关注，他开始想象人们可能会用什么话和什么词来形容。“钱德勒先生具有创作流畅优雅诗歌的天赋。”……“徒然神往的感伤弥漫在这些诗歌当中。”……“凯尔特的情调。”可惜的是他的名字不是特别具有爱尔兰特色。也许在他的姓前面插入他母亲的名字会好一些：托马斯·马龙·钱德勒，或者更好的办法是：托·马龙·钱德勒。他会和加拉赫谈谈这件事。","Every step brought him nearer to London, farther from his own sober inartistic life.A light began to tremble on the horizon of his mind.He was not so old—thirty-two.His temperament might be said to be just at the point of maturity.There were so many different moods and impressions that he wished to express in verse.He felt them within him.He tried weigh his soul to see if it was a poet’s soul.Melancholy was the dominant note of his temperament, he thought, but it was a melancholy tempered by recurrences of faith and resignation and simple joy.If he could give expression to it in a book of poems perhaps men would listen.He would never be popular: he saw that.He could not sway the crowd but he might appeal to a little circle of kindred minds.The English critics, perhaps, would recognise him as one of the Celtic school by reason of the melancholy tone of his poems; besides that, he would put in allusions.He began to invent sentences and phrases from the notice which his book would get.“Mr. Chandler has the gift of easy and graceful verse.”... “wistful sadness pervades these poems.”... “The Celtic note.” It was a pity his name was not more Irish-looking.Perhaps it would be better to insert his mother’s name before the surname: Thomas Malone Chandler, or better still: T. Malone Chandler.He would speak to Gallaher about it."
"他热切投入地遐想着，以至走过了他要去的那条街，于是又不得不往回走。当他走近科利斯酒店时，又开始充满先前那种焦虑情绪，他犹豫着在门口停步不前。最后他还是打开门，走了进去。","He pursued his revery so ardently that he passed his street and had to turn back.As he came near Corless’s his former agitation began to overmaster him and he halted before the door in indecision.Finally he opened the door and entered."
"酒吧里的光线和噪音让他在门口停留了片刻。他朝四周张望，但是他的视线却被许多闪动着亮光的红红绿绿的酒杯给搅乱了。在他看来，这家酒吧似乎挤满了人，他感觉这些人都在好奇地打量着他。他迅速地朝左右看了看（微微地皱着眉头以便让自己跑这一趟显得像是件正经事），不过在他视线清晰了一些之后，他看到没人扭头看他：而在那边，确定无疑的就是伊格内休斯·加拉赫，他背倚着柜台站着，叉开双脚稳扎于地。","The light and noise of the bar held him at the doorways for a few moments.He looked about him, but his sight was confused by the shining of many red and green wine-glasses. The bar seemed to him to be full of people and he felt that the people were observing him curiously.He glanced quickly to right and left (frowning slightly to make his errand appear serious), but when his sight cleared a little he saw that nobody had turned to look at him: and there, sure enough, was Ignatius Gallaher leaning with his back against the counter and his feet planted far apart."
"“嗨，汤米，老英雄，你来了！要点什么？你要喝点什么？我在喝威士忌：好东西，比我们在海峡那边弄到的要好。苏打水？锂氧水？不要矿泉水？我也一样。会影响口味……这儿，服务生，给我们来两份半品脱的麦芽威士忌，好伙计……哎，上次我见你之后，你过得怎么样啊？亲爱的上帝，我们都变得有多老啊！你看出我有什么变老的迹象了吗——啊，什么？头发有点变灰变少——什么？”","“Hallo, Tommy, old hero, here you are!What is it to be?What will you have?I’m taking whisky: better stuff than we get across the water.Soda? Lithia?No mineral?I’m the same Spoils the flavour.... Here, garcon, bring us two halves of malt whisky, like a good fellow.... Well, and how have you been pulling along since I saw you last?Dear God, how old we’re getting!Do you see any signs of aging in me—eh, what?A little grey and thin on the top—what?”"
"伊格内休斯·加拉赫摘下帽子，露出一个剃着短发的大脑袋。他浓眉大眼、脸色苍白，胡子刮得很干净。他那双蓝灰色的眼睛在他戴的鲜橘色领带上方熠熠闪光，缓和了他那不健康的苍白面色。在这两种相斥的特征之间，他的嘴巴显得很大，形状不好看还没什么血色。他低下头，用两根手指怜惜地抚弄着头顶上稀疏的头发。小钱德勒摇摇头予以否认。伊格内休斯·加拉赫又戴上了帽子。","Ignatius Gallaher took off his hat and displayed a large closely cropped head.His face was heavy, pale and cleanshaven.His eyes, which were of bluish slate-colour, relieved his unhealthy pallor and shone out plainly above the vivid orange tie he wore.Between these rival features the lips appeared very long and shapeless and colourless.He bent his head and felt with two sympathetic fingers the thin hair at the crown.Little Chandler shook his head as a denial.Ignatius Galaher put on his hat again."
"“它会把人累垮，”他说，“新闻界的生活。总是匆匆忙忙紧紧张张，到处找稿子有时还找不着：然后呢，还总得在自己那点东西里弄出点新花样。我说，这几天就让校对和排版都见鬼去吧。我真是高兴极了，我跟你说，能回到祖国来。度个短假对人有好处。从我再次踏上熟悉的肮脏的都柏林土地起，我感觉真是好多了……给你，汤米。水？想要就说。”","“It pulls you down,” he said.“Press life.Always hurry and scurry, looking for copy and sometimes not finding it: and then, always to have something new in your stuff.Damn proofs and printers, I say, for a few days.I’m deuced glad, I can tell you, to get back to the old country.Does a fellow good, a bit of a holiday.I feel a ton better since I landed again in dear dirty Dublin.... Here you are, Tommy.Water? Say when.”"
"小钱德勒让人把自己的威士忌酒稀释了很多。","Little Chandler allowed his whisky to be very much diluted."
"“你不知道什么对你好，我的伙计，”伊格内休斯·加拉赫说，“我喝就不掺水。”","“You don’t know what’s good for you, my boy,” said Ignatius Gallaher.“I drink mine neat.”"
"“我通常喝得很少，”小钱德勒谦逊地说道，“遇到好朋友的时候才会喝半品脱左右：那就最多了。”","“I drink very little as a rule,” said Little Chandler modestly.“An odd half-one or so when I meet any of the old crowd: that’s all.”"
"“嗯，来吧，”伊格内休斯·加拉赫高兴地说，“为我们，也为过去的时光和过去的交情。”","“Ah well,” said Ignatius Gallaher, cheerfully, “here’s to us and to old times and old acquaintance.”"
"他们碰了酒杯，一饮而尽。","They clinked glasses and drank the toast."
"“今天我见着了一些老伙计，”伊格内休斯·加拉赫说，“奥哈拉看上去过得很糟。他在干什么呢？”“什么都没干，”小钱德勒说，“他已经堕落了。”","“I met some of the old gang today,” said Ignatius Gallaher.“O’Hara seems to be in a bad way.What’s he doing?”“Nothing,” said Little Chandler.“He’s gone to the dogs.”"
"“不过霍根倒过得不错，对吧？”","“But Hogan has a good sit, hasn’t he?”"
"“对，他在土地委员会工作。”","“Yes; he’s in the Land Commission.”"
"“在伦敦的时候有一天晚上我遇见过他，看上去很有钱……可怜的奥哈拉！我猜是喝酒太多了吧？”“还有其他原因。”小钱德勒简短地说。","“I met him one night in London and he seemed to be very flush.... Poor O’Hara!Boose, I suppose?”“Other things, too,” said Little Chandler shortly."
"伊格内休斯·加拉赫笑了。","Ignatius Gallaher laughed."
"“汤米，”他说，“我看你一丁点都没变。你还是那副严肃认真的老样子，以前每到星期天早上，当我脑袋疼舌苔厚的时候，你常常会给我讲道理。你曾经想去世界各地转转。难道就算是旅游你也没去过什么地方吗？”","“Tommy,” he said, “I see you haven’t changed an atom.You’re the very same serious person that used to lecture me on Sunday mornings when I had a sore head and a fur on my tongue.You’d want to knock about a bit in the world.Have you never been anywhere even for a trip?”"
"“我去过马恩岛。”小钱德勒说。","“I’ve been to the Isle of Man,” said Little Chandler."
"伊格内休斯·加拉赫笑了。","Ignatius Gallaher laughed."
"“马恩岛！”他说，“应该去伦敦或巴黎：还是选巴黎吧。那会对你有好处。”“你去过巴黎吗？”","“The Isle of Man!” he said.“Go to London or Paris: Paris, for choice.That’d do you good.”“Have you seen Paris?”"
"“我想我应该算是去过了！我在那儿呆过一阵。”“真有他们说的那么美吗？”小钱德勒问道。","“I should think I have!I’ve knocked about there a little.”“And is it really so beautiful as they say?” asked Little Chandler."
"他呷了一小口酒，而伊格内休斯·加拉赫则把自己的酒豪饮而尽。","He sipped a little of his drink while Ignatius Gallaher finished his boldly."
"“美？”伊格内休斯·加拉赫说，琢磨着这个字眼和酒的余味，“要知道，它也不算很美。当然了，它是美……不过最关键的是巴黎的生活；那才是本质所在。啊，没有哪座城市能像巴黎那样让人体会快乐、动感、刺激……”","“Beautiful?” said Ignatius Gallaher, pausing on the word and on the flavour of his drink.“It’s not so beautiful, you know.Of course, it is beautiful.... But it’s the life of Paris; that’s the thing.Ah, there’s no city like Paris for gaiety, movement, excitement....”"
"小钱德勒喝光了他的威士忌，然后费了些劲才捕捉到了那个酒吧男招待的目光。他又点了同样的酒。","Little Chandler finished his whisky and, after some trouble, succeeded in catching the barman’s eye.He ordered the same again."
"“我去过红磨坊，”当酒吧男招待拿走他们的酒杯时，伊格内休斯·加拉赫继续说道，“我去过所有波西米亚人开的咖啡馆。很火爆的地方！但不适合像你这样虔诚的家伙，汤米。”","“I’ve been to the Moulin Rouge,” Ignatius Gallaher continued when the barman had removed their glasses, “and I’ve been to all the Bohemian cafes.Hot stuff!Not for a pious chap like you, Tommy.”"
"小钱德勒什么都没说，一直等到酒吧男招待又给他们端来两杯酒：他轻轻地碰了一下朋友的酒杯，回敬了先前提议的那杯酒。他开始觉得有些醒悟了。加拉赫的口音和表达方式没有让他感到高兴。他朋友身上有某种他过去从未注意到的庸俗的东西。不过也许这只是身处新闻界的喧嚣与竞争，并且在伦敦生活的结果。昔日的个人魅力在这种新派俗气的举止之下仍旧依稀可见。再者，说到底，加拉赫有了生活经验，他已见过了世面。小钱德勒艳羡地看着他的朋友。","Little Chandler said nothing until the barman returned with two glasses: then he touched his friend’s glass lightly and reciprocated the former toast.He was beginning to feel somewhat disillusioned.Gallaher’s accent and way of expressing himself did not please him.There was something vulgar in his friend which he had not observed before.But perhaps it was only the result of living in London amid the bustle and competition of the Press.The old personal charm was still there under this new gaudy manner.And, after all, Gallaher had lived, he had seen the world.Little Chandler looked at his friend enviously."
"“巴黎的一切都是快乐的，”伊格内休斯·加拉赫说，“他们信奉的是享受生活——难道你不觉得他们是对的吗？要是你想好好享受一下的话，你就必须要去巴黎。不过，你要记住，那里的人对爱尔兰人可是很反感的。当他们听说我是爱尔兰人的时候，他们简直想把我吃了，伙计。”","“Everything in Paris is gay,” said Ignatius Gallaher.“They believe in enjoying life—and don’t you think they’re right?If you want to enjoy yourself properly you must go to Paris.And, mind you, they’ve a great feeling for the Irish there.When they heard I was from Ireland they were ready to eat me, man.”"
"小钱德勒就着酒杯呷了四五口酒。","Little Chandler took four or five sips from his glass."
"“告诉我，”他说，“巴黎真地是那么……像他们说的那样堕落吗？”","“Tell me,” he said, “is it true that Paris is so... immoral as they say?”"
"伊格内休斯·加拉赫用他的右臂做了一个表示宽容的手势。","Ignatius Gallaher made a catholic gesture with his right arm."
"“每个地方都是堕落的，”他说，“当然，你的确会在巴黎发现下流之处。比如，去参加一个学生舞会。如果你喜欢的话，那儿会很是狂热，尤其是当妓女们开始放纵自己的时候。我猜，你知道她们都是些什么人吧？”","“Every place is immoral,” he said.“Of course you do find spicy bits in Paris.Go to one of the students’ balls, for instance.That’s lively, if you like, when the cocottes begin to let themselves loose.You know what they are, I suppose?”"
"“我听说过她们那种人。”小钱德勒说。","“I’ve heard of them,” said Little Chandler."
"伊格内休斯·加拉赫喝干了他的威士忌，然后摇了摇头。","Ignatius Gallaher drank off his whisky and shook his head."
"“啊，”他说，“你想怎么说都可以。任何女人都不像巴黎女人那么——有风情，会享乐。”","“Ah,” he said, “you may say what you like.There’s no woman like the Parisienne—for style, for go.”"
"“那么说它就是个堕落的城市了，”小钱德勒带着羞怯的执着说道——“我的意思是，如果拿它和伦敦或都柏林相比的话？”","“Then it is an immoral city,” said Little Chandler, with timid insistence—“I mean, compared with London or Dublin?”"
"“伦敦！”伊格内休斯·加拉赫说，“一个是六，一个是半打，都一个样。你问问霍根，伙计。他在伦敦那会儿我领他去转了转。他会让你开眼的……我说，汤米，别把威士忌当潘趣酒来喝：干了。”","“London!” said Ignatius Gallaher.“It’s six of one and half-a-dozen of the other.You ask Hogan, my boy.I showed him a bit about London when he was over there.He’d open your eye.... I say, Tommy, don’t make punch of that whisky: liquor up.”"
"“不行，真的……”","“No, really....”"
"“哦，来吧，再来一杯对你不会有啥害处的。喝什么？我猜还点一样的？”","“O, come on, another one won’t do you any harm.What is it?The same again, I suppose?”"
"“那……好吧。”","“Well... all right.”"
"“服务生，再来两份一样的……你抽烟吗，汤米？”","“Francois, the same again.... Will you smoke, Tommy?”"
"伊格内休斯·加拉赫掏出了他的雪茄烟盒。两个朋友点上雪茄抽了起来，一声不吭，直到他们的酒被端了过来。","Ignatius Gallaher produced his cigar-case.The two friends lit their cigars and puffed at them in silence until their drinks were served."
"“我给你讲讲我的看法，”过了好一会儿，伊格内休斯·加拉赫从他藏身的团团烟雾中露出脸来说道，“那是个稀奇古怪的地方。谈谈堕落！我听说过一些事情——我在说什么呢？——我知道那些事：那些……堕落的事……”","“I’ll tell you my opinion,” said Ignatius Gallaher, emerging after some time from the clouds of smoke in which he had taken refuge, “it’s a rum world.Talk of immorality!I’ve heard of cases—what am I saying?—I’ve known them: cases of... immorality....”"
"伊格内休斯·加拉赫若有所思地抽着雪茄，然后，用一种平静的好像历史学家的口吻，他开始为他的朋友勾勒一些国外屡见不鲜的腐败场面。他简要叙述了许多首都城市的罪恶，似乎倾向于把棕榈枝奖给柏林。有些事情他无法肯定（是朋友们给他讲的），不过另外一些事可就是他亲身经历过的了。他可不管对方的地位等级。他揭露了欧洲大陆宗教机构里的许多秘密，描述了上流社会的一些时髦做法，最后还详细地讲述了有关一个英格兰公爵夫人的故事——一个据他了解是真实的故事。小钱德勒很是吃惊。","Ignatius Gallaher puffed thoughtfully at his cigar and then, in a calm historian’s tone, he proceeded to sketch for his friend some pictures of the corruption which was rife abroad.He summarised the vices of many capitals and seemed inclined to award the palm to Berlin.Some things he could not vouch for (his friends had told him), but of others he had had personal experience.He spared neither rank nor caste.He revealed many of the secrets of religious houses on the Continent and described some of the practices which were fashionable in high society and ended by telling, with details, a story about an English duchess—a story which he knew to be true.Little Chandler was astonished."
"“啊，好了，”伊格内休斯·加拉赫说，“现在咱们是在古旧滞后的都柏林，这儿可没听说过像这样的事。”","“Ah, well,” said Ignatius Gallaher, “here we are in old jog-along Dublin where nothing is known of such things.”"
"“你肯定觉得它很无聊吧，”小钱德勒说，“尤其是你已经见识过了所有其他那些地方！”","“How dull you must find it,” said Little Chandler, “after all the other places you’ve seen!”"
"“其实，”伊格内休斯·加拉赫，“回这儿来是一种放松，你要知道。毕竟，它是祖国嘛，正如他们说的那样，不是吗？你总难免对它怀有某种感情。这是人的本性……不过跟我讲讲你自己吧。霍根告诉我说你已经……尝到了婚姻幸福的喜乐。两年前的事，对吗？”","“Well,” said Ignatius Gallaher, “it’s a relaxation to come over here, you know.And, after all, it’s the old country, as they say, isn’t it?You can’t help having a certain feeling for it.That’s human nature.... But tell me something about yourself.Hogan told me you had... tasted the joys of connubial bliss.Two years ago, wasn’t it?”"
"小钱德勒脸红了，笑了笑。","Little Chandler blushed and smiled."
"“对，”他说，“我前年五月结的婚。”","“Yes,” he said.“I was married last May twelve months.”"
"“我希望现在送上我的祝福还不算太迟，”伊格内休斯·加拉赫说，“我不知道你的地址，要不我当时就这样做了。”","“I hope it’s not too late in the day to offer my best wishes,” said Ignatius Gallaher.“I didn’t know your address or I’d have done so at the time.”"
"他伸出一只手，小钱德勒握住了那只手。","He extended his hand, which Little Chandler took."
"“听着，汤米，”他说，“我希望你和你的家人生活得事事如意，老伙计，有很多很多钱，祝愿你永远都不会死，除非我用枪打死你。这是一个挚友，一个老友的祝福。你明白吗？”","“Well, Tommy,” he said, “I wish you and yours every joy in life, old chap, and tons of money, and may you never die till I shoot you.And that’s the wish of a sincere friend, an old friend.You know that?”"
"“我明白。”小钱德勒说。","“I know that,” said Little Chandler."
"“有孩子了吗？”伊格内休斯·加拉赫问道。","“Any youngsters?” said Ignatius Gallaher."
"小钱德勒又脸红了。","Little Chandler blushed again."
"“我们有一个孩子。”他说。","“We have one child,” he said."
"“儿子还是女儿？”","“Son or daughter?”"
"“一个小男孩。”","“A little boy.”"
"伊格内休斯·加拉赫用力拍了拍他朋友的后背。","Ignatius Gallaher slapped his friend sonorously on the back."
"“好极了，”他说，“我绝对相信你，汤米。”","“Bravo,” he said, “I wouldn’t doubt you, Tommy.”"
"小钱德勒笑了，他困惑地看着自己的酒杯，像孩子般用三颗洁白的门牙咬着下嘴唇。","Little Chandler smiled, looked confusedly at his glass and bit his lower lip with three childishly white front teeth."
"“我希望你能和我们一起过一晚，”他说，“然后你再走。我妻子会很高兴见到你的。我们可以听听音乐然后——”","“I hope you’ll spend an evening with us,” he said, “before you go back.My wife will be delighted to meet you.We can have a little music and——”"
"“非常感谢，老伙计，”伊格内休斯·加拉赫说，“很遗憾我们没能早点见面。不过我明晚必须得走。”","“Thanks awfully, old chap,” said Ignatius Gallaher, “I’m sorry we didn’t meet earlier.But I must leave tomorrow night.”"
"“今晚，要不就……？”","“Tonight, perhaps...?”"
"“我非常抱歉，老朋友。你瞧我是和另一个人来这儿的，他也是个聪明的年轻人，我们已经安排好了要去一个牌局。要不是因为这个……”","“I’m awfully sorry, old man. You see I’m over here with another fellow, clever young chap he is too, and we arranged to go to a little card-party.Only for that...”"
"“哦，那样的话……”","“O, in that case...”"
"“不过谁知道呢？”伊格内休斯·加拉赫体谅地说道，“既然我已经有了破冰之旅，明年我可能会来这儿住段时间。只是把乐事往后推一推而已。”","“But who knows?” said Ignatius Gallaher considerately.“Next year I may take a little skip over here now that I’ve broken the ice.It’s only a pleasure deferred.”"
"“好极了，”小钱德勒说，“下次你来我们一定要一块过夜。现在就说定了，好吗？”","“Very well,” said Little Chandler, “the next time you come we must have an evening together.That’s agreed now, isn’t it?”"
"“好的，说定了。”伊格内休斯·加拉赫说。“明年要是我来的话，说话算话。”","“Yes, that’s agreed,” said Ignatius Gallaher.“Next year if I come, parole d’honneur.”"
"“为了敲定这个事，”小钱德勒说，“咱们现在再来最后一杯。”","“And to clinch the bargain,” said Little Chandler, “we’ll just have one more now.”"
"伊格内休斯·加拉赫掏出一块大金表看了看。","Ignatius Gallaher took out a large gold watch and looked at it."
"“这可是最后一杯？”他说，“因为你知道，我还有一份稿子需要校对。”","“Is it to be the last?” he said.“Because you know, I have an a.p.”"
"“哦，好，肯定是。”小钱德勒说。","“O, yes, positively,” said Little Chandler."
"“那就太好了，”伊格内休斯·加拉赫说，“咱们就再喝一杯上路酒——我觉得方言里指一小杯威士忌的这种叫法很不错。”","“Very well, then,” said Ignatius Gallaher, “let us have another one as a deoc an doruis—that’s good vernacular for a small whisky, I believe.”"
"小钱德勒点了酒。他的脸上在片刻之前泛起的红晕开始定格。一件小事都能随时让他脸红：现在他觉得又热又兴奋。三小杯威士忌已经上了他的头，加拉赫那根劲大的雪茄也搅乱了他的脑子，因为他是个体质纤弱、饮食节制的人。他原本性情敏感；八年之后遇见加拉赫，发觉自己和加拉赫在科利斯酒店置身于灯光声色之中，听加拉赫的故事，分享一小段加拉赫那漂泊不定但却颇有成就的生活，这种冒险般的经历打破了他内心的平静。他深切地感受到了他自己的生活与他朋友的生活之间的强烈反差，这对他来说似乎有些不公平。就出身和教育而言，加拉赫是不如他的。他确信，一旦得到机会，他一定能做成大事，做得比他朋友做过的和能做的都要好，不是那种华而不实的新闻工作，而是更高品位的大事。是什么妨碍了他呢？他那该死的羞怯！他希望以某种方式来证明自己，来宣扬自己的男子汉气概。他看清了加拉赫拒绝他的邀请背后的原因。加拉赫只是在用友善来施舍他，就像他在用此行施舍爱尔兰一样。","Little Chandler ordered the drinks.The blush which had risen to his face a few moments before was establishing itself.A trifle made him blush at any time: and now he felt warm and excited.Three small whiskies had gone to his head and Gallaher’s strong cigar had confused his mind, for he was a delicate and abstinent person.The adventure of meeting Gallaher after eight years, of finding himself with Gallaher in Corless’s surrounded by lights and noise, of listening to Gallaher’s stories and of sharing for a brief space Gallaher’s vagrant and triumphant life, upset the equipoise of his sensitive nature.He felt acutely the contrast between his own life and his friend’s and it seemed to him unjust.Gallaher was his inferior in birth and education.He was sure that he could do something better than his friend had ever done, or could ever do, something higher than mere tawdry journalism if he only got the chance.What was it that stood in his way?His unfortunate timidity! He wished to vindicate himself in some way, to assert his manhood.He saw behind Gallaher’s refusal of his invitation.Gallaher was only patronising him by his friendliness just as he was patronising Ireland by his visit."
"酒吧男招待拿来了他们的酒。小钱德勒先把其中一杯推到他朋友面前，然后爽快地拿起了另一杯。","The barman brought their drinks.Little Chandler pushed one glass towards his friend and took up the other boldly."
"“谁知道呢？”他说道，当他们举起酒杯的时候，“你明年再来的时候，我也许会很高兴地祝愿伊格内休斯·加拉赫先生及太太长寿幸福。”","“Who knows?” he said, as they lifted their glasses.“When you come next year I may have the pleasure of wishing long life and happiness to Mr. and Mrs. Ignatius Gallaher.”"
"正在喝酒的伊格内休斯·加拉赫在酒杯的边缘颇有意味地闭上了一只眼。喝完之后，他果决地砸吧着嘴唇，放下酒杯，说道：","Ignatius Gallaher in the act of drinking closed one eye expressively over the rim of his glass.When he had drunk he smacked his lips decisively, set down his glass and said:"
"“压根不用担心这事，我的小伙子。我要先纵情享乐，见识见识生活和世界，然后才会把头伸进婚姻的麻袋里——如果我真要那么做的话。”","“No blooming fear of that, my boy. I’m going to have my fling first and see a bit of life and the world before I put my head in the sack—if I ever do.”"
"“有一天你会的，”小钱德勒平静地说。","“Some day you will,” said Little Chandler calmly."
"伊格内休斯·加拉赫把他那橘色的领结和灰蓝色的眼睛完全转向了他的朋友。","Ignatius Gallaher turned his orange tie and slate-blue eyes full upon his friend."
"“你真这么想吗？”他说。","“You think so?” he said."
"“你会把头伸进婚姻口袋里的，”小钱德勒断然重复道，“就像所有其他人一样，如果你能找到适合你的女孩。”","“You’ll put your head in the sack,” repeated Little Chandler stoutly, “like everyone else if you can find the girl.”"
"他略微加强了自己的语调，他意识到自己有些失态了；不过，尽管他脸颊的颜色更浓了，他并没有在他朋友的注视之下退缩。伊格内休斯·加拉赫盯着他看了好一会儿，然后说道：","He had slightly emphasised his tone and he was aware that he had betrayed himself; but, though the colour had heightened in his cheek, he did not flinch from his friend’s gaze.Ignatius Gallaher watched him for a few moments and then said:"
"“如果这种事真的发生的话，你可以用你的最后一块钱打赌，绝对不会有所谓痴情和幻想搅在里面。我是想和钱结婚的。她在银行得要有一大笔丰厚的存款，否则她就不适合我。”","“If ever it occurs, you may bet your bottom dollar there’ll be no mooning and spooning about it.I mean to marry money.She’ll have a good fat account at the bank or she won’t do for me.”"
"小钱德勒摇了摇头。","Little Chandler shook his head."
"”哎，大活人，“伊格内休斯·加拉赫言辞激烈地说道，“你知道这是怎么回事吗？我只需要说句话，明天我就能拥有女人和钱。你不相信？这嘛，我明白。有成百——我在说什么呢？——有成千富有的德国人和犹太人，受到了金钱的腐化，都只巴不得……你等一会儿我的小伙子。看看我是否能把牌玩好。当我做一件事的时候，我会把它当生意做，我跟你说。你就等着吧。”","“Why, man alive,” said Ignatius Gallaher, vehemently, “do you know what it is?I’ve only to say the word and tomorrow I can have the woman and the cash.You don’t believe it?Well, I know it.There are hundreds—what am I saying?—thousands of rich Germans and Jews, rotten with money, that’d only be too glad.... You wait a while my boy. See if I don’t play my cards properly.When I go about a thing I mean business, I tell you.You just wait.”"
"他把酒杯送到嘴边，喝完了酒，大声笑了起来。然后他若有所思地看着前方，用一种比较平静的语调说道：","He tossed his glass to his mouth, finished his drink and laughed loudly.Then he looked thoughtfully before him and said in a calmer tone:"
"“不过我不着急。她们可以等着。我不想把自己拴在一个女人身上，你知道。”","“But I’m in no hurry.They can wait.I don’t fancy tying myself up to one woman, you know.”"
"他用嘴巴装出品尝的样子，然后做了一个扭曲的鬼脸。","He imitated with his mouth the act of tasting and made a wry face."
"“一定是有点过期了，我觉得，”他说。","“Must get a bit stale, I should think,” he said."
"小钱德勒坐在门厅旁边的房间里，怀里抱着一个孩子。为了省钱，他们没有雇请仆人，只是让安妮的妹妹莫妮卡早上过来一个小时左右，傍晚过来一个小时左右给帮帮忙。但是莫妮卡早就回家了。时间是差一刻九点钟。小钱德勒回家喝茶晚了些，另外，他还忘了从比利茶饮店带一包咖啡回来。当然她心情不好，应答他的话都很简短。她说没有茶她完全可以，可是眼看拐角店铺关门的时间快到了，她决定自己出去买四分之一磅茶叶和两磅糖。她利落地把睡着的孩子往他怀里一放，说道：","Little Chandler sat in the room off the hall, holding a child in his arms.To save money they kept no servant but Annie’s young sister Monica came for an hour or so in the morning and an hour or so in the evening to help.But Monica had gone home long ago.It was a quarter to nine.Little Chandler had come home late for tea and, moreover, he had forgotten to bring Annie home the parcel of coffee from Bewley’s.Of course she was in a bad humour and gave him short answers.She said she would do without any tea but when it came near the time at which the shop at the corner closed she decided to go out herself for a quarter of a pound of tea and two pounds of sugar.She put the sleeping child deftly in his arms and said:"
"“给。别弄醒他。”一盏带有白瓷灯罩的小灯立在桌子上，灯光洒落在一张镶在弯角相框里的照片上。那是安妮的照片。小钱德勒看着照片，目光停在了那薄薄的紧闭的双唇上。她穿着浅蓝色的夏衫，那是他在某个星期六给她带回家的一件礼物。夏衫花了他十镑十一便士；可他饱受了多少不安的煎熬啊！那天他受了多大的煎熬啊！他一直等在商店门口，直到里面没有顾客；售货员小姐把一堆女士衬衫放在他面前时，他站在柜台前竭力保持着自然；他付完帐之后忘了拿找回的零钱，又被出纳叫了回来；最后，当他离开商店时，他一边掩饰着脸上的红晕，一边仔细检查包裹是否绑好了。他拿着上衣回了家，安妮吻了他，说衣服非常好看，也很时髦；不过当她一听说价钱的时候，她立马把衣服扔到了桌子上，说那样一件衣服要价十镑十一便士简直就是敲诈。起初她想把它退回去，不过当她试穿的时候，她很喜欢，尤其喜欢袖子的式样，于是她又吻了他，说他能想到她真是太好了。","“Here.Don’t waken him.”A little lamp with a white china shade stood upon the table and its light fell over a photograph which was enclosed in a frame of crumpled horn.It was Annie’s photograph.Little Chandler looked at it, pausing at the thin tight lips.She wore the pale blue summer blouse which he had brought her home as a present one Saturday.It had cost him ten and eleven pence; but what an agony of nervousness it had cost him!How he had suffered that day, waiting at the shop door until the shop was empty, standing at the counter and trying to appear at his ease while the girl piled ladies’ blouses before him, paying at the desk and forgetting to take up the odd penny of his change, being called back by the cashier, and finally, striving to hide his blushes as he left the shop by examining the parcel to see if it was securely tied.When he brought the blouse home Annie kissed him and said it was very pretty and stylish; but when she heard the price she threw the blouse on the table and said it was a regular swindle to charge ten and elevenpence for it.At first she wanted to take it back but when she tried it on she was delighted with it, especially with the make of the sleeves, and kissed him and said he was very good to think of her."
"哼！……","Hm!..."
"他冷冷地看着照片中的那双眼睛，它们也冷冷地回视着。当然它们是漂亮的，那张脸本身也是漂亮的。不过他发现那脸上有某种刻薄的神情。它为什么那么冷漠，俨然贵妇人的样子呢？那双眼睛镇静自若的神情让他感到恼火。它们排斥他，藐视他：眼神里没有热情，没有痴狂。他想起了加拉赫说起过的那些有钱的犹太女人。那些带有东方韵味的黑眼睛，他想，一定充满了热情，充满了纵欲的想望！……他为何与照片中长着那双眼睛的人结婚了呢？","He looked coldly into the eyes of the photograph and they answered coldly.Certainly they were pretty and the face itself was pretty.But he found something mean in it.Why was it so unconscious and ladylike?The composure of the eyes irritated him.They repelled him and defied him: there was no passion in them, no rapture.He thought of what Gallaher had said about rich Jewesses.Those dark Oriental eyes, he thought, how full they are of passion, of voluptuous longing!...Why had he married the eyes in the photograph?"
"他纠结于这个问题，不安地环视着房间。他发现那些漂亮的家具也有种令人厌恶的特点，他是以分期付款的形式买下这些家具来装饰他的房子的。安妮亲自挑选的，它们又让他想起了她。家具也都是整洁美观的。一种模模糊糊的对自己生活的憎恶感在他的内心蠢蠢欲动。难道他不能逃离开自己的小房子吗？努力去像加拉赫那样无畏地过活，对他来说是不是太迟了呢？他能去伦敦吗？可还有这些家具得付款呢。只要他写一本书，然后设法出版，那就有可能为他打开出路。","He caught himself up at the question and glanced nervously round the room.He found something mean in the pretty furniture which he had bought for his house on the hire system.Annie had chosen it herself and it reminded him of her.It too was prim and pretty.A dull resentment against his life awoke within him.Could he not escape from his little house?Was it too late for him to try to live bravely like Gallaher?Could he go to London?There was the furniture still to be paid for.If he could only write a book and get it published, that might open the way for him."
"一本拜伦诗集放在他面前的桌子上。他用左手小心翼翼地翻开书，唯恐他会吵醒孩子，他开始读书里的第一首诗：","A volume of Byron’s poems lay before him on the table.He opened it cautiously with his left hand lest he should waken the child and began to read the first poem in the book:"
"寂静的是风，凝滞的是夜的黑暗，西风已不在林间穿行，而我却回来看望我的玛格丽特之墓，鲜花撒满在我爱的那片尘土。","Hushed are the winds and still the evening gloom, Not e’en a Zephyr wanders through the grove, Whilst I return to view my Margaret’s tomb And scatter flowers on the dust I love."
"他停了下来。他感觉到房间里有这首诗的节奏围绕在他四周。多么忧郁的一首诗啊！他能否也像这样来写作，用诗歌来传达灵魂的忧郁?有太多的东西他想去描述：比如，几个小时以前他在格拉顿桥上的感受。要是他能再回到当时那种心境……","He paused.He felt the rhythm of the verse about him in the room.How melancholy it was!Could he, too, write like that, express the melancholy of his soul in verse?There were so many things he wanted to describe: his sensation of a few hours before on Grattan Bridge, for example.If he could get back again into that mood...."
"孩子醒了，开始哭了起来。他从正读着的那页书转过头去，尽力想让孩子安静下来：可那孩子就是不愿意安静下来。他把孩子抱在怀里来回摇了起来，可是孩子的啼哭声却变得更加刺耳。他更快地摇动着孩子，而他的眼睛则开始看第二诗节：","The child awoke and began to cry.He turned from the page and tried to hush it: but it would not be hushed.He began to rock it to and fro in his arms but its wailing cry grew keener.He rocked it faster while his eyes began to read the second stanza:"
"在这促狭的地穴里躺着她的躯壳，这躯壳里曾经……","Within this narrow cell reclines her clay, That clay where once..."
"这不管用。他没法读下去。他什么事情也做不了。孩子的啼哭声穿透了他的耳膜。这不管用，不管用！他一辈子都是个囚徒。他的双臂由于愤怒而颤抖着，猛然他俯身冲着孩子的脸大叫道：","It was useless.He couldn’t read.He couldn’t do anything.The wailing of the child pierced the drum of his ear.It was useless, useless!He was a prisoner for life.His arms trembled with anger and suddenly bending to the child’s face he shouted:"
"“够了！”","“Stop!”"
"孩子有片刻停止了啼哭，吓得一阵抽搐，随后又开始尖厉地哭叫起来。他从椅子上一跃而起，抱着孩子急躁地在房间里来回走动起来。孩子开始可怜地抽噎，有四五秒钟喘不过气来，然后又再次爆发。房间单薄的墙壁回荡着那哭声。他极力去安哄孩子，可孩子却呜咽得更加厉害。他看着孩子那抽搐颤抖的脸，开始惊慌起来。他数了数，一连有七次没有间歇的抽噎，他惊恐地把孩子抱在胸前。要是孩子死了！……","The child stopped for an instant, had a spasm of fright and began to scream.He jumped up from his chair and walked hastily up and down the room with the child in his arms.It began to sob piteously, losing its breath for four or five seconds, and then bursting out anew.The thin walls of the room echoed the sound.He tried to soothe it but it sobbed more convulsively.He looked at the contracted and quivering face of the child and began to be alarmed.He counted seven sobs without a break between them and caught the child to his breast in fright.If it died!..."
"门突然打开，一个年轻女人气喘吁吁地跑了进来。","The door was burst open and a young woman ran in, panting."
"“这是怎么了？这是怎么了？”她叫喊着。","“What is it?What is it?” she cried."
"孩子听到母亲的声音旋即又爆发出了一阵剧烈的抽噎。","The child, hearing its mother’s voice, broke out into a paroxysm of sobbing."
"“没什么，安妮……没什么……他开始哭……”","“It’s nothing, Annie... it’s nothing.... He began to cry...”"
"她把自己的包裹往地板上猛地一扔，一下子从他怀里夺走了孩子。","She flung her parcels on the floor and snatched the child from him."
"“你对他做什么了？”她喊道，怒视着他的脸。","“What have you done to him?” she cried, glaring into his face."
"小钱德勒有片刻经受住了她眼睛的盯视，但是当他遭遇其中的憎恨时，他的心紧缩在了一起。他开始结巴起来：","Little Chandler sustained for one moment the gaze of her eyes and his heart closed together as he met the hatred in them.He began to stammer:"
"“没什么……他……他开始哭……我无法……我什么都没做……怎么了？”","“It’s nothing.... He... he began to cry.... I couldn’t... I didn’t do anything.... What?”"
"她根本没有理睬他便开始在房间里来回走动起来，怀里紧紧抱着孩子，轻声低语着：","Giving no heed to him she began to walk up and down the room, clasping the child tightly in her arms and murmuring:"
"“我的小人儿！我的小小人儿！吓着了吧，宝贝？……现在好啦，宝贝！现在好啦！……小羊羔！妈妈永远的小羊羔！现在好啦！”","“My little man!My little mannie!Was ’ou frightened, love?...There now, love!There now!...Lambabaun! Mamma’s little lamb of the world!...There now!”"
"小钱德勒感到满脸羞愧，他退后站到了灯光照不到的地方。他听着，孩子的抽噎声逐渐变弱；悔恨的泪水盈满了他的眼睛。","Little Chandler felt his cheeks suffused with shame and he stood back out of the lamplight.He listened while the paroxysm of the child’s sobbing grew less and less; and tears of remorse started to his eyes."
"第九章 对手","CHAPTER 9 COUNTERPARTS"
"铃声急切地响起，帕克小姐走到听筒前，一个愤怒的声音用尖厉的爱尔兰北部口音大声叫道：","THE bell rang furiously and, when Miss Parker went to the tube, a furious voice called out in a piercing North of Ireland accent:"
"“让法林顿到这儿来！”","“Send Farrington here!”"
"帕克小姐返回到自己的打字机旁，对着正在桌子旁边写东西的一个男人说道：","Miss Parker returned to her machine, saying to a man who was writing at a desk:"
"“阿莱恩先生想让你上楼去。”","“Mr. Alleyne wants you upstairs.”"
"那个男人低声嘟哝着“去他的！”，把椅子往后推了推以便能站起身来。他站起来的时候，个子很高，块头很大。他长着一张神情沮丧的脸，深紫红色，眉毛和胡须则是浅色的：他的眼睛略微有些向外鼓，眼白浑浊不清。他掀起柜台面，从客户们身边经过，拖着沉重的步子走出了办公室。","The man muttered “Blast him!” under his breath and pushed back his chair to stand up.When he stood up he was tall and of great bulk.He had a hanging face, dark wine-coloured, with fair eyebrows and moustache: his eyes bulged forward slightly and the whites of them were dirty.He lifted up the counter and, passing by the clients, went out of the office with a heavy step."
"他缓慢地上楼来到第二个平台，那里的一扇门上挂着写有“阿莱恩先生”字样的铜牌。在那里他停了下来，因为疲倦和忧虑而喘着气，然后他敲了门。那个尖锐的嗓音叫道：","He went heavily upstairs until he came to the second landing, where a door bore a brass plate with the inscription Mr. Alleyne.Here he halted, puffing with labour and vexation, and knocked.The shrill voice cried:"
"“进来！”","“Come in!”"
"这个男人走进了阿莱恩先生的房间。与此同时，阿莱恩先生——一个胡须刮得干干净净、戴着金边眼镜的小个子男人——从一大堆文件中猛地一下抬起头来。那颗脑袋没有头发，颜色粉嫩，看上去就像是放在文件上的一颗大鸡蛋。阿莱恩先生马上说道：","The man entered Mr. Alleyne’s room.Simultaneously Mr. Alleyne, a little man wearing gold-rimmed glasses on a cleanshaven face, shot his head up over a pile of documents.The head itself was so pink and hairless it seemed like a large egg reposing on the papers.Mr. Alleyne did not lose a moment:"
"“法林顿？这是什么意思？为什么我总要埋怨你呢？我可否问一下，你为什么没有抄一份鲍德利和柯万之间合同的副本？我告诉过你必须在四点钟之前准备好。”","“Farrington?What is the meaning of this?Why have I always to complain of you?May I ask you why you haven’t made a copy of that contract between Bodley and Kirwan?I told you it must be ready by four o’clock.”"
"“可谢利先生说，先生——”","“But Mr. Shelley said, sir——”"
"“谢利先生说，先生……要好好留心我说的话，而不是谢利先生说的话，先生。你总有这样或那样的借口来逃避工作。我告诉你，要是那份合同在今晚之前抄不完的话，我就把这件事上报到克罗斯比先生那里……你现在听明白我的话了吗？”","“Mr. Shelley said, sir.... Kindly attend to what I say and not to what Mr. Shelley says, sir.You have always some excuse or another for shirking work.Let me tell you that if the contract is not copied before this evening I’ll lay the matter before Mr. Crosbie.... Do you hear me now?”"
"“是的，先生。”","“Yes, sir.”"
"“你现在听明白我的话了？……对了，还有一件小事。我和你说话就像在和一堵墙说话。记牢了，你有半个小时来吃午饭，而不是一个半小时。我真想知道，你到底要点多少菜……你现在记住我的话了吗？”","“Do you hear me now?...Ay and another little matter!I might as well be talking to the wall as talking to you.Understand once for all that you get a half an hour for your lunch and not an hour and a half.How many courses do you want, I’d like to know.... Do you mind me now?”"
"“是的，先生。”","“Yes, sir.”"
"阿莱恩先生重新埋头于他那堆文件之中。那个男人一动不动地盯着那个管理着克罗斯比-阿莱恩公司事务的锃亮的脑壳，估摸着它有多脆弱。一阵愤怒攫住了他的喉咙，几分钟之后这种感觉消失了，却留下一种强烈的干渴感。那个男人意识到了这种感觉，觉得他必须要去好好喝一晚上的酒。已经过了月中，如果他能及时完成那份抄件的话，阿莱恩先生可能会给他一张汇票到出纳那里拿钱。他站着不动，直勾勾地凝视着文件堆上的那颗脑袋。突然阿莱恩先生开始翻动所有的文件，找寻着什么东西。然后，仿佛在那一刻之前他一直都没意识到那个男人的存在似的，他又猛然抬起头来，说道：","Mr. Alleyne bent his head again upon his pile of papers.The man stared fixedly at the polished skull which directed the affairs of Crosbie & Alleyne, gauging its fragility.A spasm of rage gripped his throat for a few moments and then passed, leaving after it a sharp sensation of thirst.The man recognised the sensation and felt that he must have a good night’s drinking.The middle of the month was passed and, if he could get the copy done in time, Mr. Alleyne might give him an order on the cashier.He stood still, gazing fixedly at the head upon the pile of papers.Suddenly Mr. Alleyne began to upset all the papers, searching for something.Then, as if he had been unaware of the man’s presence till that moment, he shot up his head again, saying:"
"“呃？你打算在那里站一整天吗？说实在话，法林顿，你把事情都太不当回事了！”","“Eh?Are you going to stand there all day?Upon my word, Farrington, you take things easy!”"
"“我只是等着看……”","“I was waiting to see...”"
"“很好，你不必等着看了。下楼去干你的活去。”","“Very good, you needn’t wait to see.Go downstairs and do your work.”"
"那个男人缓慢地朝门口走去，他一走出那个房间，就听见阿莱恩先生在他身后喊叫说，如果那份合同到晚上还没有抄好的话，克罗斯比先生就会知道这件事。","The man walked heavily towards the door and, as he went out of the room, he heard Mr. Alleyne cry after him that if the contract was not copied by evening Mr. Crosbie would hear of the matter."
"他回到了楼下办公室的书桌旁，数了数还需要抄写的页数。他拿起笔，在墨水里蘸了蘸，然后又接着神思恍惚地盯着他已写了的最后几个单词看了起来：在任何情况下伯纳德·鲍德利所说的都不得被……夜色降临了，再过几分钟，他们就会点上煤气灯：然后他就能写了。他觉得必须要先止住喉咙的干渴。他从桌边站起身来，像刚才那样掀开柜台面，走出了办公室。当他朝外走的时候，职员主管探询地看着他。","He returned to his desk in the lower office and counted the sheets which remained to be copied.He took up his pen and dipped it in the ink but he continued to stare stupidly at the last words he had written: In no case shall the said Bernard Bodley be... The evening was falling and in a few minutes they would be lighting the gas: then he could write.He felt that he must slake the thirst in his throat.He stood up from his desk and, lifting the counter as before, passed out of the office.As he was passing out the chief clerk looked at him inquiringly."
"“没什么，谢利先生。”那个男人用一个指头指着他此行的目标说道。","“It’s all right, Mr. Shelley,” said the man, pointing with his finger to indicate the objective of his journey."
"职员主管瞥了一眼帽架，看见一排帽子都在，也就什么都不说了。那个男人一走上楼梯平台就从口袋里拽出一顶毛呢鸭舌帽，戴在头上，然后迅速跑下了摇摇晃晃的楼梯。从临街的门出来，他沿着人行道的内侧偷偷摸摸地朝街角走去，然后一下子就扎进了一扇门。他现在算是安全地置身于奥尼尔酒吧那间幽暗的包间里了，朝吧台的方向开着一扇小窗，他把呈深酒色或深肉色的涨红的脸贴在上面，喊道：","The chief clerk glanced at the hat-rack, but, seeing the row complete, offered no remark.As soon as he was on the landing the man pulled a shepherd’s plaid cap out of his pocket, put it on his head and ran quickly down the rickety stairs.From the street door he walked on furtively on the inner side of the path towards the corner and all at once dived into a doorway.He was now safe in the dark snug of O’Neill’s shop, and filling up the little window that looked into the bar with his inflamed face, the colour of dark wine or dark meat, he called out:"
"“这儿，帕特，给咱们来杯黑啤酒，好伙计。”","“Here, Pat, give us a g.p.. like a good fellow.”"
"酒吧招待给他拿来了一杯不掺水的黑啤酒。这个男人一口全喝了下去，然后要了一粒葛缕子籽。他把一便士放在柜台上，任由那个招待在昏暗之中摸索着去拿，然后就和他先前进来时一样偷偷摸摸地溜出了包间。","The curate brought him a glass of plain porter.The man drank it at a gulp and asked for a caraway seed.He put his penny on the counter and, leaving the curate to grope for it in the gloom, retreated out of the snug as furtively as he had entered it."
"黑暗伴着一片浓雾正渐渐笼罩二月的黄昏，尤斯塔斯街上的路灯已经亮起。那个男人紧挨着几栋房子往前走去，一直走到事务所门口，心里琢磨着他还能否按时完成他的抄写任务。在楼梯上一股湿润浓烈的香水味道扑鼻而来：显然在他出去到奥尼尔酒吧这一会儿功夫德拉古小姐来过了。他把帽子塞回到口袋里，然后再次踏进了事务所，做出一副心不在焉的样子。","Darkness, accompanied by a thick fog, was gaining upon the dusk of February and the lamps in Eustace Street had been lit. The man went up by the houses until he reached the door of the office, wondering whether he could finish his copy in time.On the stairs a moist pungent odour of perfumes saluted his nose: evidently Miss Delacour had come while he was out in O’Neill’s.He crammed his cap back again into his pocket and re-entered the office, assuming an air of absentmindedness."
"“阿莱恩先生一直在找你，”职员主管严肃地说道，“你去哪儿了？”","“Mr. Alleyne has been calling for you,” said the chief clerk severely.“Where were you?”"
"那个男人扫了一眼站在柜台旁边的两个客户，仿佛是在暗示他们在场让他不好作答。客户都是男的，因此职员主管任由自己笑了出来。","The man glanced at the two clients who were standing at the counter as if to intimate that their presence prevented him from answering.As the clients were both male the chief clerk allowed himself a laugh."
"“我知道那个把戏，”他说，“一天之中五次是有点……好了，你最好看起来精神点，去给阿莱恩先生拿一份德拉古案件中我们的通信副本。”","“I know that game,” he said.“Five times in one day is a little bit... Well, you better look sharp and get a copy of our correspondence in the Delacour case for Mr. Alleyne.”"
"当众听了这番话，他又是跑上楼的，再加上他刚才匆忙下肚的那杯黑啤酒，使得那个男人晕乎起来，当他坐在办公桌旁去拿需要的东西时，他意识到在五点半之前完成抄写合同的任务是多么无望。黑暗潮湿的夜降临了，他渴望能在酒吧里度过，和朋友们一起喝酒，周围是发着亮光的汽灯和叮当作响的酒杯。他取出了德拉古通信，然后走出了办公室。他希望阿莱恩先生不会发现最后两封信不见了。","This address in the presence of the public, his run upstairs and the porter he had gulped down so hastily confused the man and, as he sat down at his desk to get what was required, he realised how hopeless was the task of finishing his copy of the contract before half past five.The dark damp night was coming and he longed to spend it in the bars, drinking with his friends amid the glare of gas and the clatter of glasses.He got out the Delacour correspondence and passed out of the office.He hoped Mr. Alleyne would not discover that the last two letters were missing."
"到阿莱恩先生房间去的一路上都是潮湿浓烈的香水味道。德拉古小姐是一个长着犹太人相貌的中年女人。据说阿莱恩先生对她或者说对她的钱很是着迷。她常常来这家事务所，而且一来就会呆很长时间。现在她正坐在他的办公桌旁，浑身散发着香水的芬芳，摩挲着伞把，帽子上那根黑色的大羽毛上下颤动着。阿莱恩先生则把椅子转了过来面对着她，神气活现地把右脚搁在了左膝上。那个男人把信放在桌子上，恭敬地鞠了一躬，可是阿莱恩先生和德拉古小姐谁都没有注意到他在鞠躬。阿莱恩先生用手指敲了敲那些信，然后又朝他弹了一下那根手指，仿佛是说：“好了：你可以走了。”","The moist pungent perfume lay all the way up to Mr. Alleyne’s room.Miss Delacour was a middle-aged woman of Jewish appearance.Mr. Alleyne was said to be sweet on her or on her money.She came to the office often and stayed a long time when she came.She was sitting beside his desk now in an aroma of perfumes, smoothing the handle of her umbrella and nodding the great black feather in her hat. Mr. Alleyne had swivelled his chair round to face her and thrown his right foot jauntily upon his left knee.The man put the correspondence on the desk and bowed respectfully but neither Mr. Alleyne nor Miss Delacour took any notice of his bow. Mr. Alleyne tapped a finger on the correspondence and then flicked it towards him as if to say: “That’s all right: you can go.”"
"那个男人回到了楼下的办公室，又在自己的办公桌旁坐了下来。他专注地盯着那句没写完的话：在任何情况下伯纳德·鲍德利所说的都不得被……觉得它很是奇怪，最后三个单词都是以同一个字母开头的。职员主管开始催促帕克小姐，说她肯定是无法及时把信件打印出来邮寄了。那个男人听着打字机的喀嗒声听了有几分钟，然后才着手来完成他的抄写任务。但是他的脑袋不清楚，思绪则又飘向了酒馆的灯光和叮叮当当的碰撞声。这是一个适合去喝热潘趣酒的夜晚。他勉强坚持着继续抄写，可钟敲五点的时候他还有十四页没写完。该死！他不能按时抄完了。他真想大声诅咒，用拳头去猛击什么东西。他愤怒极了，结果把伯纳德·鲍德利写成了伯纳德·伯纳德，他不得不换一张白纸重写。","The man returned to the lower office and sat down again at his desk.He stared intently at the incomplete phrase: In no case shall the said Bernard Bodley be... and thought how strange it was that the last three words began with the same letter.The chief clerk began to hurry Miss Parker, saying she would never have the letters typed in time for post.The man listened to the clicking of the machine for a few minutes and then set to work to finish his copy.But his head was not clear and his mind wandered away to the glare and rattle of the public-house.It was a night for hot punches.He struggled on with his copy, but when the clock struck five he had still fourteen pages to write.Blast it!He couldn’t finish it in time.He longed to execrate aloud, to bring his fist down on something violently.He was so enraged that he wrote Bernard Bernard instead of Bernard Bodley and had to begin again on a clean sheet."
"他感到自己非常有劲，一个人就能把整个事务所的人都干掉。他的身体渴望去做点什么事，渴望冲出去纵情于暴力之中。生活中的种种屈辱使他感到愤怒……他能私下跟出纳预支点儿钱吗？不行，那出纳不怎么样，很他妈的不怎么样：他不会预支的……他知道在哪里他能碰上那几个小伙子：雷纳德、奥哈洛伦和诺塞·弗林。他情感状态的晴雨表显示出一段暴乱时期即将来临。","He felt strong enough to clear out the whole office singlehanded.His body ached to do something, to rush out and revel in violence.All the indignities of his life enraged him.... Could he ask the cashier privately for an advance?No, the cashier was no good, no damn good: he wouldn’t give an advance.... He knew where he would meet the boys: Leonard and O’Halloran and Nosey Flynn.The barometer of his emotional nature was set for a spell of riot."
"他的想象极大地分散了他的注意力，名字被人叫了两次他才应答。阿莱恩先生和德拉古小姐正站在柜台外面，所有的职员都转过头来，感觉到要发生什么事情了。那个男人从桌子旁边站起身来。阿莱恩先生喋喋不休地责骂起来，说有两封信不见了。那个男人回答说他对此一无所知，他只是老老实实地抄写了一份。冗长的责骂依旧继续：恶毒激烈的程度使那个男人几乎忍不住想举拳朝站在他面前的这个小个子的脑袋砸去。","His imagination had so abstracted him that his name was called twice before he answered.Mr. Alleyne and Miss Delacour were standing outside the counter and all the clerks had turn round in anticipation of something.The man got up from his desk.Mr. Alleyne began a tirade of abuse, saying that two letters were missing.The man answered that he knew nothing about them, that he had made a faithful copy.The tirade continued: it was so bitter and violent that the man could hardly restrain his fist from descending upon the head of the manikin before him:"
"“我对什么其他两封信一无所知。”他愚鲁地说道。","“I know nothing about any other two letters,” he said stupidly."
"“你——一无——所知。你当然一无所知。”阿莱恩说。“告诉我，”他先朝身边的那位女士瞥了一眼以获得认可，然后接着说道，“你把我当傻瓜了吗？你觉得我是个十足的傻瓜吗？”","“You—know—nothing.Of course you know nothing,” said Mr. Alleyne.“Tell me,” he added, glancing first for approval to the lady beside him, “do you take me for a fool?Do you think me an utter fool?”"
"男人把目光从这位女士的脸上转到了那个鸡蛋一样的脑袋上，他的舌头下意识地抓住了这个时机：","The man glanced from the lady’s face to the little egg-shaped head and back again; and, almost before he was aware of it, his tongue had found a felicitous moment:"
"“我不认为，先生，”他说，“这对我来说是个公正的问题。”","“I don’t think, sir,” he said, “that that’s a fair question to put to me.”"
"一时间职员们都屏住了呼吸。所有的人都惊呆了（说这俏皮话的主人也丝毫不亚于他的邻座们），德拉古小姐——一个身形结实、和蔼可亲的人——则咧嘴笑了起来。阿莱恩先生的脸色一下子红得就像一朵野玫瑰，他的嘴由于矮人所具有的激愤而抽动着。他在那个男人面前摇晃着一个拳头，那拳头晃得就像是某种电器的球形把手：","There was a pause in the very breathing of the clerks.Everyone was astounded (the author of the witticism no less than his neighbours) and Miss Delacour, who was a stout amiable person, began to smile broadly.Mr. Alleyne flushed to the hue of a wild rose and his mouth twitched with a dwarf’s passion.He shook his fist in the man’s face till it seemed to vibrate like the knob of some electric machine:"
"“你这个无礼的恶棍！你这个无礼的恶棍！我会干脆利落地把你干掉！你等着瞧！你要么为你的鲁莽无礼向我道歉，要么就立马辞职走人！我告诉你，你要么辞职，要么就向我道歉！”","“You impertinent ruffian!You impertinent ruffian!I’ll make short work of you!Wait till you see!You’ll apologise to me for your impertinence or you’ll quit the office instanter!You’ll quit this, I’m telling you, or you’ll apologise to me!”"
"他站在事务所对面的一个门道里观察着，看那个出纳是否会一个人出来。所有的职员都走出来了，最后出纳和职员主管一块走了出来。他和职员主管在一起，那想和他说什么都没用。那个男人感到他的处境真是糟透了。他已经因为自己的鲁莽无理而被迫向阿莱恩先生卑躬屈膝地道了歉，但是他知道事务所对他来说将会是个非常难呆的马蜂窝。他还记得阿莱恩先生为了给自己的侄子腾出空位是怎样把小皮克从事务所轰走的。他感到怒不可遏、口干舌燥，心中充满仇恨，对自己，对所有其他人都感到恼怒。阿莱恩先生绝不会让他有哪怕是一个小时的休息时间；他将饱受人间地狱之苦。这一次他可真是出了个大丑。难道他就不能让自己的舌头老老实实地呆在嘴里吗？不过，他和阿莱恩先生，他们根本也就没有齐心过，自打有一天他模仿阿莱恩先生的爱尔兰北部口音逗希金斯和帕克小姐乐的时候被阿莱恩先生无意中听到之后，他们的不和就开始了。他或许可以试着向希金斯借点钱，可显然希金斯自己也从来都没什么钱。一个同时需要维护两处产业的男人，当然他无法……","He stood in a doorway opposite the office watching to see if the cashier would come out alone.All the clerks passed out and finally the cashier came out with the chief clerk.It was no use trying to say a word to him when he was with the chief clerk.The man felt that his position was bad enough.He had been obliged to offer an abject apology to Mr. Alleyne for his impertinence but he knew what a hornet’s nest the office would be for him. He could remember the way in which Mr. Alleyne had hounded little Peake out of the office in order to make room for his own nephew.He felt savage and thirsty and revengeful, annoyed with himself and with everyone else.Mr. Alleyne would never give him an hour’s rest; his life would be a hell to him. He had made a proper fool of himself this time.Could he not keep his tongue in his cheek?But they had never pulled together from the first, he and Mr. Alleyne, ever since the day Mr. Alleyne had overheard him mimicking his North of Ireland accent to amuse Higgins and Miss Parker: that had been the beginning of it. He might have tried Higgins for the money, but sure Higgins never had anything for himself.A man with two establishments to keep up, of course he couldn’t...."
"他感到他那壮硕的身体又急需酒馆的慰藉了。他开始感觉到雾气的寒冷，他在想他能否在奥尼尔酒吧说动帕特。他向他借不到超过一先令的钱——一个先令根本没用。然而他必须得从什么地方弄到点钱：他已经把最后一便士花掉买了那杯黑啤酒，过不了多久就从哪儿都弄不到钱了。他用手指抚弄着表链，突然他想起了位于舰队街的特里·凯利的典当行。就是它了！为什么他没能早点想起它呢？","He felt his great body again aching for the comfort of the public-house.The fog had begun to chill him and he wondered could he touch Pat in O’Neill’s.He could not touch him for more than a bob—and a bob was no use.Yet he must get money somewhere or other: he had spent his last penny for the g.p. and soon it would be too late for getting money anywhere.Suddenly, as he was fingering his watch-chain, he thought of Terry Kelly’s pawn-office in Fleet Street.That was the dart!Why didn’t he think of it sooner?"
"他迅速穿过坦普尔酒吧狭窄的通道，嘟囔着自言自语道，他们都见鬼去吧，因为他将度过一个美好的夜晚。特里·凯利店里的职员说一克朗！可货主坚持要六先令；最后六先令居然还真给了他。他满心欢喜地从典当行走出来，把硬币放在大拇指和其他手指之间摞成了一个小圆柱体。在威斯特摩兰街，人行道上挤满了下班回家的年轻男女，衣衫褴褛的流浪儿们这儿那儿地跑动着，嘴里叫喊着各种晚报的名称。那个男人从人群中经过，带着颇为自得的满足感旁观着这番景象，很有自制能力地盯着那些办公室女郎。他的脑子里满是有轨电车的铃铛声以及疾驰而过的无轨电车的噪音，他的鼻子已经嗅到了潘趣酒那袅袅升腾起来的香气。在他往前走着的时候，他提前考虑着他会用什么样的措辞来给小伙子们讲述这件事：","He went through the narrow alley of Temple Bar quickly, muttering to himself that they could all go to hell because he was going to have a good night of it. The clerk in Terry Kelly’s said A crown! but the consignor held out for six shillings; and in the end the six shillings was allowed him literally.He came out of the pawn-office joyfully, making a little cylinder, of the coins between his thumb and fingers.In Westmoreland Street the footpaths were crowded with young men and women returning from business and ragged urchins ran here and there yelling out the names of the evening editions.The man passed through the crowd, looking on the spectacle generally with proud satisfaction and staring masterfully at the office-girls.His head was full of the noises of tram-gongs and swishing trolleys and his nose already sniffed the curling fumes punch.As he walked on he preconsidered the terms in which he would narrate the incident to the boys:"
"“于是，我就看着他——要知道，是沉着地看着他，然后又看着她。然后我又再次看着他——不慌不忙地，你们要知道。‘我不认为这对我来说是个公正的问题。’我说。”","“So, I just looked at him—coolly, you know, and looked at her.Then I looked back at him again—taking my time, you know.‘I don’t think that that’s a fair question to put to me,’ says I.”"
"诺塞·弗林直着身子坐在戴维·拜恩酒馆里他常坐的一个角落里，当他听完这个故事之后，他请法林顿喝了半份酒，说这是他曾经听说过办得最漂亮的一件事。法林顿也请了他一次酒。过了一会儿，奥哈洛伦和帕迪·伦纳德进来了，那个故事又给他们讲了一遍。奥哈洛伦请大家喝了热麦芽酒，然后讲了他曾经做过的跟职员主管顶嘴的故事，那是他在福恩斯街的卡伦事务所的时候发生的事；不过，那次顶嘴是仿照了牧歌里说话随便的牧羊人的样子来的，所以他不得不承认那可不如法林顿的顶嘴那么聪明。听了这话，法林顿就让小伙子们把手中的酒喝掉，然后再来一杯。","Nosey Flynn was sitting up in his usual corner of Davy Byrne’s and, when he heard the story, he stood Farrington a half-one, saying it was as smart a thing as ever he heard.Farrington stood a drink in his turn.After a while O‘Halloran and Paddy Leonard came in and the story was repeated to them.O’Halloran stood tailors of malt, hot, all round and told the story of the retort he had made to the chief clerk when he was in Callan’s of Fownes’s Street; but, as the retort was after the manner of the liberal shepherds in the eclogues, he had to admit that it was not as clever as Farrington’s retort.At this Farrington told the boys to polish off that and have another."
"正当他们报出各自想要的烈酒名称的时候，希金斯进来了，还能有谁呢！当然他不得不加入这几个人。几个人让他讲讲他所了解的那件事，他照着做了，讲得绘声绘色，因为看见那五小杯热威士忌酒是非常振奋人心的。所有的人都轰然大笑，因为他学了阿莱恩先生在法林顿的脸跟前挥舞拳头的样子。然后，他模仿着法林顿的样子说道：“这就是我的小伙子，你想让他有多酷他就有多酷。”法林顿用他那深沉浑浊的眼睛看着这帮朋友，微笑着，时不时地用下唇舔去胡须上残留的酒滴。","Just as they were naming their poisons who should come in but Higgins!Of course he had to join in with the others.The men asked him to give his version of it, and he did so with great vivacity for the sight of five small hot whiskies was very exhilarating.Everyone roared laughing when he showed the way in which Mr. Alleyne shook his fist in Farrington’s face.Then he imitated Farrington, saying, “And here was my nabs, as cool as you please,” while Farrington looked at the company out of his heavy dirty eyes, smiling and at times drawing forth stray drops of liquor from his moustache with the aid of his lower lip."
"那轮酒喝过之后，接下来是一阵间歇。奥哈洛伦还有钱，可其他两个人看来是都没钱了；于是一帮人略有些遗憾地离开了那家店铺。在公爵街的拐角处，希金斯和诺塞·弗林向左斜插着走去，而另外三个人则返身朝城里走去。小雨淅淅沥沥地洒落在寒冷的街道上，当他们走到巴拉斯特事务所的时候，法林顿建议去苏格兰酒馆。酒吧里挤满了人，嘈杂着各种各样的语言和酒杯碰撞的声音。三个人推开那些在门口哀求着叫卖火柴的人走了进去，在柜台拐角处结成一个小派对。他们开始轮流讲故事。伦纳德把他们介绍给了一个名叫韦瑟斯的年轻人，他当时正在蒂沃里当杂技演员和闹剧艺人。法林顿请大家喝了一杯。韦瑟斯说他想要一小杯爱尔兰威士忌加阿波利纳里斯矿泉水。法林顿对他所说的东西有着明确的看法，他问小伙子们是否也想来一杯阿波利纳里斯；但小伙子们却叫蒂姆把他们的那份弄成热的。谈话开始变得有些戏剧性。奥哈洛伦请了一圈，然后法林顿又请了一圈，韦瑟斯抗议说这种好客之举是太过爱尔兰的做法。他应承说会带他们到后台去，然后介绍他们认识几个漂亮妞儿。奥哈洛伦说他和伦纳德会去，可法林顿不会去，因为他是个已婚男人；法林顿那双深沉浑浊的眼睛斜睨着他的伙伴，显然他明白自己正在遭受奚落。韦瑟斯让他们都尝了尝他买的药酒，然后应承说晚些时候他会在普尔贝格街的马利根酒吧再和他们碰面。","When that round was over there was a pause.O‘Halloran had money but neither of the other two seemed to have any; so the whole party left the shop somewhat regretfully.At the corner of Duke Street Higgins and Nosey Flynn bevelled off to the left while the other three turned back towards the city.Rain was drizzling down on the cold streets and, when they reached the Ballast Office, Farrington suggested the Scotch House.The bar was full of men and loud with the noise of tongues and glasses.The three men pushed past the whining match-sellers at the door and formed a little party at the corner of the counter.They began to exchange stories.Leonard introduced them to a young fellow named Weathers who was performing at the Tivoli as an acrobat and knockabout artiste.Farrington stood a drink all round.Weathers said he would take a small Irish and Apollinaris.Farrington, who had definite notions of what was what, asked the boys would they have an Apollinaris too; but the boys told Tim to make theirs hot.The talk became theatrical.O’Halloran stood a round and then Farrington stood another round, Weathers protesting that the hospitality was too Irish.He promised to get them in behind the scenes and introduce them to some nice girls.O’Halloran said that he and Leonard would go, but that Farrington wouldn’t go because he was a married man; and Farrington’s heavy dirty eyes leered at the company in token that he understood he was being chaffed.Weathers made them all have just one little tincture at his expense and promised to meet them later on at Mulligan’s in Poolbeg Street."
"苏格兰酒吧关门之后，他们就去了马利根酒吧。他们走到酒吧的后厅，奥哈洛伦给大伙儿都点了一小份特色热酒。他们都开始有些醉了。法林顿正要再请一圈酒的时候，韦瑟斯回来了。让法林顿大为释怀的是，这一次韦瑟斯喝了一杯苦啤酒。钱变得越来越少，不过还足够他们继续喝下去。不一会儿，两个头戴大帽子的年轻女子和一个身穿格子西装的年轻男子走了进来，坐在了紧挨着的一张桌子旁边。韦瑟斯和他们打了招呼，然后告诉伙伴们说这些人是从蒂沃里剧院出来的。法林顿的眼睛时不时地瞟向其中一个年轻女子。她的外貌很有点引人注目。一条孔雀蓝色的大纱巾绕在帽子上，在她的下巴处打了一个巨大的蝴蝶结；她戴着亮黄色的手套，长及肘部。法林顿艳羡地盯着她姿态优雅、动来动去的那条丰满的手臂；过了一小会儿，当她回应他的凝视时，他更加爱慕起她那对深褐色的大眼睛来。那眼睛里包含着的婉转凝视的神情深深地吸引了他。她朝他瞥了一两眼，当一行人离开房间的时候，她蹭到了他的椅子，然后带着伦敦口音说了声“哦，对不起！”。他看着她离开房间，希望她会回头看他，但却大失所望。他咒怨自己怎么没有钱，咒怨自己怎么请人喝了那么多圈酒，尤其是他请韦瑟斯喝的那些威士忌酒加阿波利纳里斯矿泉水。他此时最恨的就是酒鬼。他非常生气，结果都搞不清楚朋友们在谈些什么了。","When the Scotch House closed they went round to Mulligan’s.They went into the parlour at the back and O’Halloran ordered small hot specials all round.They were all beginning to feel mellow.Farrington was just standing another round when Weathers came back.Much to Farrington’s relief he drank a glass of bitter this time.Funds were getting low but they had enough to keep them going.Presently two young women with big hats and a young man in a check suit came in and sat at a table close by. Weathers saluted them and told the company that they were out of the Tivoli.Farrington’s eyes wandered at every moment in the direction of one of the young women.There was something striking in her appearance.An immense scarf of peacock-blue muslin was wound round her hat and knotted in a great bow under her chin; and she wore bright yellow gloves, reaching to the elbow.Farrington gazed admiringly at the plump arm which she moved very often and with much grace; and when, after a little time, she answered his gaze he admired still more her large dark brown eyes.The oblique staring expression in them fascinated him.She glanced at him once or twice and, when the party was leaving the room, she brushed against his chair and said “O, pardon!” in a London accent.He watched her leave the room in the hope that she would look back at him, but he was disappointed.He cursed his want of money and cursed all the rounds he had stood, particularly all the whiskies and Apolinaris which he had stood to Weathers.If there was one thing that he hated it was a sponge.He was so angry that he lost count of the conversation of his friends."
"当帕迪·伦纳德叫他的时候，他才发现他们正在谈论各自力气方面的表现。韦瑟斯正在给大家展示他的二头肌，大肆夸耀，结果另两个人就号召法林顿来维护民族荣誉。于是法林顿便卷起了袖子，给大家展示他的二头肌。两条胳膊经过一番审视和比较，最后大家一致同意要来场力量比试。桌子被收拾利落，两个人把胳膊肘放在上面，紧紧握住了手。帕迪·伦纳德一说“开始！”这两个人都极力想把对方的手掰倒到桌子上。法林顿看上去非常严肃和坚毅。","When Paddy Leonard called him he found that they were talking about feats of strength.Weathers was showing his biceps muscle to the company and boasting so much that the other two had called on Farrington to uphold the national honour.Farrington pulled up his sleeve accordingly and showed his biceps muscle to the company.The two arms were examined and compared and finally it was agreed to have a trial of strength.The table was cleared and the two men rested their elbows on it, clasping hands.When Paddy Leonard said “Go!” each was to try to bring down the other’s hand on to the table.Farrington looked very serious and determined."
"比试开始了。过了大约三十秒之后，韦瑟斯把对家的手慢慢地压到了桌子上。法林顿那深酒色的脸变得得更加深红了，被这样一个小年青打败让他备感愤怒和羞辱。","The trial began.After about thirty seconds Weathers brought his opponent’s hand slowly down on to the table.Farrington’s dark wine-coloured face flushed darker still with anger and humiliation at having been defeated by such a stripling."
"“你不能在后面用身体的重量来使劲。要规规矩矩地来比。”他说。","“You’re not to put the weight of your body behind it. Play fair,” he said."
"“谁没有规规矩矩地比？”另一个人说道。","“Who’s not playing fair?” said the other."
"“那就再来。三局两胜。”比试又开始了。青筋凸显在法林顿的前额上，韦瑟斯那苍白的脸色也变成了牡丹红。他们的手和胳膊都由于过分使劲而颤抖着。经过一次持久的努力，韦瑟斯再次把对家的手慢慢地压到了桌子上。旁观的人群中传来了一阵轻微的掌声。酒吧男招待站在桌子旁边，他朝胜利者点了点他那满头红发的脑袋，然后用笨拙的亲密语气说道：","“Come on again.The two best out of three.”The trial began again.The veins stood out on Farrington’s forehead, and the pallor of Weathers’ complexion changed to peony.Their hands and arms trembled under the stress.After a long struggle Weathers again brought his opponent’s hand slowly on to the table.There was a murmur of applause from the spectators.The curate, who was standing beside the table, nodded his red head towards the victor and said with stupid familiarity:"
"“啊！这可真是绝技！”“你他妈知道什么？”法林顿转身冲那个人恶狠狠地说道，“你凭啥乱嚼舌头？”","“Ah!That’s the knack!”“What the hell do you know about it?” said Farrington fiercely, turning on the man. “What do you put in your gab for?”"
"“嘘，嘘！”奥哈洛伦说，他注意到了法林顿脸上那凶狠的神情。“该结账了，小伙子们。咱们再喝一小杯，然后咱们就走。”一个满脸愠怒的男人站在奥康奈尔桥的拐角处，等着开往桑迪芒特的小型有轨电车载他回家。他心中满是闷烧着的怒火和报复的念头。他感到很丢脸，也很不满；他甚至都没有丝毫醉意；他口袋里只有两便士了。他咒怨着一切。他已经亲手断送了事务所里的差事，典当了自己的怀表，花光了所有的钱；可他却一点都没醉。他又开始感到干渴，他真想再返回去坐在那又热又臭的酒馆里。他已经丢掉了大力士的名声，两次都输给了一个毛头小伙子。他心中积满愤怒，当他想起那个头戴大帽子的女人蹭到了他然后说“对不起！”的时候，他的愤怒几乎使他窒息。","“Sh, sh!” said O’Halloran, observing the violent expression of Farrington’s face.“Pony up, boys.We’ll have just one little smahan more and then we’ll be off.”A very sullen-faced man stood at the corner of O’Connell Bridge waiting for the little Sandymount tram to take him home.He was full of smouldering anger and revengefulness.He felt humiliated and discontented; he did not even feel drunk; and he had only twopence in his pocket.He cursed everything.He had done for himself in the office, pawned his watch, spent all his money; and he had not even got drunk.He began to feel thirsty again and he longed to be back again in the hot reeking public-house.He had lost his reputation as a strong man, having been defeated twice by a mere boy. His heart swelled with fury and, when he thought of the woman in the big hat who had brushed against him and said Pardon! his fury nearly choked him."
"他乘坐的有轨电车在谢尔本路让他下了车，他扭动着他那巨大的身躯，在兵营墙体的阴影里一路朝前走去。他非常讨厌回家。他从侧门进去的时候发现厨房里没人，炉火几乎已经熄灭了。他冲着楼上大叫起来：","His tram let him down at Shelbourne Road and he steered his great body along in the shadow of the wall of the barracks.He loathed returning to his home.When he went in by the side-door he found the kitchen empty and the kitchen fire nearly out.He bawled upstairs:"
"“埃达！埃达！”他的妻子是一个尖脸的小个子女人，在他丈夫清醒的时候她会欺负他，而在他喝醉的时候则会受他欺负。他们有五个孩子。一个小男孩跑下楼来。","“Ada!Ada!”His wife was a little sharp-faced woman who bullied her husband when he was sober and was bullied by him when he was drunk.They had five children.A little boy came running down the stairs."
"“那是谁？”那个男人边说边在黑暗中费力地瞅着。","“Who is that?” said the man, peering through the darkness."
"“我，爸。”","“Me, pa.”"
"“你是谁？查利？”“不，爸。汤姆。”","“Who are you?Charlie?”“No, pa. Tom.”"
"“你妈妈在哪儿？”","“Where’s your mother?”"
"“她到教堂去了。”","“She’s out at the chapel.”"
"“好吧……她想着给我留晚饭了吗？”","“That’s right.... Did she think of leaving any dinner for me?”"
"“是的，爸。我——”","“Yes, pa. I—”"
"“点灯。你让这地方漆黑一片什么意思？其他孩子都睡了？”","“Light the lamp.What do you mean by having the place in darkness?Are the other children in bed?”"
"那个男人重重地在一把椅子上坐下来，而那个小男孩则去点着了灯。他开始模仿儿子含混的口音半是自言自语地说道：“去教堂了。去教堂了，随你的便！”灯点着的时候，他一拳砸在桌子上，喊道：","The man sat down heavily on one of the chairs while the little boy lit the lamp.He began to mimic his son’s flat accent, saying half to himself: “At the chapel. At the chapel, if you please!”When the lamp was lit he banged his fist on the table and shouted:"
"“我的晚饭是什么？”","“What’s for my dinner?”"
"“我正要……去做，爸。”那个小男孩说。","“I’m going... to cook it, pa,” said the little boy."
"那个男人愤怒地跳起身来，指着炉火。","The man jumped up furiously and pointed to the fire."
"“就在那个火上！你让火都灭了！上帝作证，我要教训你看你还敢这样做！”","“On that fire!You let the fire out!By God, I’ll teach you to do that again!”"
"他一步迈到门口，抓起了立在门后的那根拐杖。","He took a step to the door and seized the walking-stick which was standing behind it."
"“我教你再让火熄灭！”他一边说，一边卷起了一只袖子准备大打儿子一场。","“I’ll teach you to let the fire out!” he said, rolling up his sleeve in order to give his arm free play."
"小男孩喊着“哦，爸！”绕着桌子一边跑一边哭叫了起来，但那个男人撵上他，抓住了他的衣服。小男孩慌乱地朝四下看了看，但却无路可逃，于是一下子跪在了地上。","The little boy cried “O, pa!” and ran whimpering round the table, but the man followed him and caught him by the coat.The little boy looked about him wildly but, seeing no way of escape, fell upon his knees."
"“好，我让你下次再把火看灭了！”那个男人一边说一边用拐杖使劲地抽打他，“揍你一顿，你个小畜生！”","“Now, you’ll let the fire out the next time!” said the man striking at him vigorously with the stick.“Take that, you little whelp!”"
"拐杖抽到了大腿上，男孩发出一声痛苦的尖叫。他双手紧握着举过头顶，害怕得声音都在颤抖。","The boy uttered a squeal of pain as the stick cut his thigh.He clasped his hands together in the air and his voice shook with fright."
"“哦，爸！”他哭喊着，“别打我，爸！我会……我会为你说‘万福玛丽亚’……我会为你说‘万福玛丽亚’，爸，只要你别打我……我会为你说‘万福玛丽亚’……”","“O, pa!” he cried.“Don’t beat me, pa!And I’ll... I’ll say a Hail Mary for you.... I’ll say a Hail Mary for you, pa, if you don’t beat me.... I’ll say a Hail Mary....”"
"第十章 泥土","CHAPTER 10 CLAY"
"女总管已经答应她外出的请求，女人们一用完茶她就可以走了，玛丽亚期待着她那天晚上的外出。厨房里干干净净：厨子说人都能在大铜锅上照见自己的人影。火烧得又旺又亮，在一张靠墙的小桌上放着四个非常大的葡萄干面包。这些面包看上去好像还未切开；但是如果你走近些，你就会看见它们已经被均匀地切成了又长又厚的几块，准备在用茶时分给大家。玛丽亚亲手切的这些面包。","THE matron had given her leave to go out as soon as the women’s tea was over and Maria looked forward to her evening out.The kitchen was spick and span: the cook said you could see yourself in the big copper boilers.The fire was nice and bright and on one of the side-tables were four very big barmbracks.These barmbracks seemed uncut; but if you went closer you would see that they had been cut into long thick even slices and were ready to be handed round at tea.Maria had cut them herself."
"玛丽亚的确是一个非常非常矮小的人，可她却长着一个很长的鼻子和一个很长的下巴。她说话有点儿鼻音，总是带着安慰人的腔调：“是的，我亲爱的，”以及“不，我亲爱的。”她总被派过去调停女人们为争浴盆而发生的争吵，而且总能够成功地息事宁人。有一天，女总管跟她说：","Maria was a very, very small person indeed but she had a very long nose and a very long chin.She talked a little through her nose, always soothingly: “Yes, my dear,” and “No, my dear.” She was always sent for when the women quarrelled over their tubs and always succeeded in making peace.One day the matron had said to her:"
"“玛丽亚，你可真是个名副其实的和平使者！”","“Maria, you are a veritable peace-maker!”"
"副总管和董事会中的两位女士都听到了这句赞美的话。金格·穆尼也总是说，如果不是因为玛丽亚，她才不会搭理那个负责熨斗的哑巴。大家都非常喜欢玛丽亚。","And the sub-matron and two of the Board ladies had heard the compliment.And Ginger Mooney was always saying what she wouldn’t do to the dummy who had charge of the irons if it wasn’t for Maria.Everyone was so fond of Maria."
"女人们会在六点钟用茶，那样她在七点之前就能离开。从鲍尔斯桥到纪念柱，二十分钟；从纪念柱到德拉姆康德拉，二十分钟；然后二十分钟去买东西。她会在八点之前到那儿。她取出她那带银扣的钱包，又读了一遍那几个词：“来自贝尔法斯特的一件礼物”。她非常喜欢那个钱包，因为那是乔五年前买给她的，当时他和阿尔菲在圣灵降临节后的第一个星期一到贝尔法斯特去旅行。在那个钱包里有两枚半克朗的硬币和一些铜币。付了电车票钱之后，她还会有五个先令整。他们将度过多么美好的一个夜晚啊，所有的孩子都会唱歌！只是她希望乔来的时候不会是醉醺醺的。他只要喝点酒就会大不一样。","The women would have their tea at six o’clock and she would be able to get away before seven.From Ballsbridge to the Pillar, twenty minutes; from the Pillar to Drumcondra, twenty minutes; and twenty minutes to buy the things.She would be there before eight.She took out her purse with the silver clasps and read again the words A Present from Belfast.She was very fond of that purse because Joe had brought it to her five years before when he and Alphy had gone to Belfast on a Whit-Monday trip.In the purse were two half-crowns and some coppers.She would have five shillings clear after paying tram fare.What a nice evening they would have, all the children singing!Only she hoped that Joe wouldn’t come in drunk.He was so different when he took any drink."
"他常常想让她过去和他们一起生活；——可她觉得自己会碍事（尽管乔的妻子一直都对她非常好），再说她也已经适应了洗衣房的生活。乔是一个好人。她曾经哺养过他，也哺养过阿尔菲；因此乔过去经常说：","Often he had wanted her to go and live with them;—but she would have felt herself in the way (though Joe’s wife was ever so nice with her) and she had become accustomed to the life of the laundry.Joe was a good fellow.She had nursed him and Alphy too; and Joe used often to say:"
"“妈妈是妈妈，可玛丽亚才是我实实在在的母亲。”","“Mamma is mamma but Maria is my proper mother.”"
"离开家之后，男孩们给她在“灯光都柏林”的洗衣房找到了这份差事，她喜欢这份工作。过去她对新教教徒一直都有非常不好的印象，不过现在她觉得他们人都很好，略显安静而严肃，但人真是不错，很好相处。后来她在温室里养了些植物，她喜欢侍弄它们。她养了可爱的蕨类植物和球兰，每当有人来拜访她的时候，她总会从她的温室里给来访者摘一两株植物的嫩枝。有一件事她不喜欢，就是走道上的那些传单；不过女总管是很好交往的一个人，非常和蔼有礼。","After the break-up at home the boys had got her that position in the Dublin by Lamplight laundry, and she liked it. She used to have such a bad opinion of Protestants but now she thought they were very nice people, a little quiet and serious, but still very nice people to live with.Then she had her plants in the conservatory and she liked looking after them.She had lovely ferns and wax-plants and, whenever anyone came to visit her, she always gave the visitor one or two slips from her conservatory.There was one thing she didn’t like and that was the tracts on the walks; but the matron was such a nice person to deal with, so genteel."
"厨子告诉她一切都准备好了，于是她走进女人们呆的房间，开始拉动那个大钟。几分钟之后，女人们开始三三两两地进来了，她们在围裙上擦着冒着热气的双手，把上衣的袖子放下来，盖住了红通通冒着热气的胳膊。她们安坐下来，面前放着她们的大茶杯，厨子和哑巴在里面倒满了热茶，热茶事先已在大锡铁罐里搅拌好，加入了牛奶和白糖。玛丽亚负责分发面包，确保每个女人都拿到了四块。用餐期间一片说笑逗趣的场面。莉齐·弗莱明说玛丽亚肯定能得到戒指，尽管这话每年万圣节前夜她都会说一次，玛丽亚不得不笑着说她既不想要戒指也不想要男人。当她笑的时候，玛丽亚灰绿色的眼睛中有既害羞又失望的神情，她的鼻尖几乎要碰到自己的下巴尖。金格·穆尼举起茶杯提议为玛丽亚的健康干杯，然后其他所有的女人就都在桌子上碰击着自己的茶杯，金格说她很遗憾不能喝一口黑啤酒来祝酒。玛丽亚又放声大笑，笑得她的鼻尖几乎碰到了她的下巴尖，笑得她那小小的身体几乎颤抖得散了架，因为她知道穆尼本意是好的，当然了，她有的都是一个寻常女人的一些想法。","When the cook told her everything was ready she went into the women’s room and began to pull the big bell.In a few minutes the women began to come in by twos and threes, wiping their steaming hands in their petticoats and pulling down the sleeves of their blouses over their red steaming arms.They settled down before their huge mugs which the cook and the dummy filled up with hot tea, already mixed with milk and sugar in huge tin cans.Maria superintended the distribution of the barmbrack and saw that every woman got her four slices.There was a great deal of laughing and joking during the meal.Lizzie Fleming said Maria was sure to get the ring and, though Fleming had said that for so many Hallow Eves, Maria had to laugh and say she didn’t want any ring or man either; and when she laughed her grey-green eyes sparkled with disappointed shyness and the tip of her nose nearly met the tip of her chin.Then Ginger Mooney lifted her mug of tea and proposed Maria’s health while all the other women clattered with their mugs on the table, and said she was sorry she hadn’t a sup of porter to drink it in.And Maria laughed again till the tip of her nose nearly met the tip of her chin and till her minute body nearly shook itself asunder because she knew that Mooney meant well though, of course, she had the notions of a common woman."
"不过当女人们喝完茶，厨子和哑巴开始收拾茶具的时候，玛丽亚怎能不开心！她走进自己那间小卧室，想起第二天早上是做弥撒的日子，于是就把闹钟的指针从七点拨到了六点。然后她脱掉了工作裙服和家居靴，把她最好的裙子摆到床上，把她那双小巧的裙装靴放在了床脚边。她把衬衫也换了，她站在镜子前面，想起了在她还是个年轻姑娘的时候她是怎样在礼拜天早上为参加弥撒而穿扮的情形；她怀着异样的感情看着自己那曾常常打扮的小小的身躯。尽管上了年岁，她发现那仍然是一个好看整洁的小巧身躯。","But wasn’t Maria glad when the women had finished their tea and the cook and the dummy had begun to clear away the tea-things!She went into her little bedroom and, remembering that the next morning was a mass morning, changed the hand of the alarm from seven to six. Then she took off her working skirt and her house-boots and laid her best skirt out on the bed and her tiny dress-boots beside the foot of the bed.She changed her blouse too and, as she stood before the mirror, she thought of how she used to dress for mass on Sunday morning when she was a young girl; and she looked with quaint affection at the diminutive body which she had so often adorned.In spite of its years she found it a nice tidy little body."
"当她出门的时候，街道上由于下雨而闪着亮光，她很高兴自己穿了那件旧的棕色雨衣。有轨电车满客了，她不得不坐在了车厢后面的那个小凳子上，面朝着所有的乘客，脚趾几乎够不着地板。她在脑子里盘算着她要做的一切，想着能够独立自主，口袋里能有自己的钱真是好多了。她希望他们会度过一个美好的夜晚。她确信他们会的，不过她还是忍不住觉得阿尔菲和乔彼此不说话真是个遗憾。他们现在总是争争吵吵，可他们还都是小男孩的时候，他们曾经是最要好的朋友：不过这就是生活。","When she got outside the streets were shining with rain and she was glad of her old brown waterproof.The tram was full and she had to sit on the little stool at the end of the car, facing all the people, with her toes barely touching the floor.She arranged in her mind all she was going to do and thought how much better it was to be independent and to have your own money in your pocket.She hoped they would have a nice evening.She was sure they would but she could not help thinking what a pity it was Alphy and Joe were not speaking.They were always falling out now but when they were boys together they used to be the best of friends: but such was life."
"她在纪念柱下了有轨电车，然后就在熙来攘往的人群中择路疾步而行。她走进唐斯糕饼店，可店里挤满了人，等了很长时间才轮到她。她买了一打价格低廉的各式蛋糕，最后拎着一个大袋子从店铺里走了出来。然后她想了想别的她还能买点什么：她想买点确实不错的东西。他们肯定已经有了很多苹果和坚果。真不知道要买什么，她能想到的就是蛋糕了。她决定买一些葡萄干蛋糕，可唐斯糕饼店里的葡萄干蛋糕上的杏仁酥皮不够厚，于是她走进了亨利街上的一家店铺。在那里，她花了很长时间来挑选，柜台后面那位时髦的年轻女士显然被她搞得很有些不耐烦，问她说她想买的是不是结婚蛋糕。这让玛丽亚一下子就脸红了，冲着那个年轻女士笑了；不过年轻女士却非常严肃地对待整件事，最终她切了厚厚的一块葡萄干蛋糕，把它包起来，然后说道：","She got out of her tram at the Pillar and ferreted her way quickly among the crowds.She went into Downes’s cake-shop but the shop was so full of people that it was a long time before she could get herself attended to.She bought a dozen of mixed penny cakes, and at last came out of the shop laden with a big bag. Then she thought what else would she buy: she wanted to buy something really nice.They would be sure to have plenty of apples and nuts.It was hard to know what to buy and all she could think of was cake.She decided to buy some plumcake but Downes’s plumcake had not enough almond icing on top of it so she went over to a shop in Henry Street.Here she was a long time in suiting herself and the stylish young lady behind the counter, who was evidently a little annoyed by her, asked her was it wedding-cake she wanted to buy.That made Maria blush and smile at the young lady; but the young lady took it all very seriously and finally cut a thick slice of plumcake, parcelled it up and said:"
"“两先令四便士。”","“Two-and-four, please.”"
"在德姆康德拉电车上，她本以为自己只能站着，因为似乎没有一个年轻人注意到她，但最后还是有一位年长的绅士给她让了座。他是一个身材结实的绅士，戴着一顶棕色的圆顶窄边毡礼帽；他长着一张红润的四方脸，蓄着一撮灰色的小胡子。玛丽亚觉得他是个颇有军官派头的绅士，她思忖着他比那些只会直勾勾盯着前面看的年轻人要有礼貌得多。那个绅士开始和她聊起了万圣节前夜和下雨的天气。他猜测说那个袋子里肯定满是给小孩子们的好东西，还说小孩子们就应该在年少的时候好好享乐才对。玛丽亚同意他的看法，不时点头嗯呃着应和着他。他对她很好，当她准备在运河桥下车的时候，她对他表示谢意并鞠躬行礼，他也冲她鞠躬，并抬起帽子，友善地笑了笑。她沿着河岸台阶往上走去，低着小脑袋抵挡着雨水，她心想，认出一个绅士真是很容易，哪怕他喝了一点酒。","She thought she would have to stand in the Drumcondra tram because none of the young men seemed to notice her but an elderly gentleman made room for her.He was a stout gentleman and he wore a brown hard hat; he had a square red face and a greyish moustache.Maria thought he was a colonel-looking gentleman and she reflected how much more polite he was than the young men who simply stared straight before them.The gentleman began to chat with her about Hallow Eve and the rainy weather.He supposed the bag was full of good things for the little ones and said it was only right that the youngsters should enjoy themselves while they were young.Maria agreed with him and favoured him with demure nods and hems.He was very nice with her, and when she was getting out at the Canal Bridge she thanked him and bowed, and he bowed to her and raised his hat and smiled agreeably, and while she was going up along the terrace, bending her tiny head under the rain, she thought how easy it was to know a gentleman even when he has a drop taken."
"当她来到乔的住所的时候，所有的人都说：“啊，玛丽亚来了！”乔也在场，已经下班回家，所有的孩子都穿上了他们的星期日礼服。里面有从隔壁人家过来的两个大女孩，正在玩游戏。玛丽亚把那袋蛋糕给了年纪最大的男孩阿尔菲让他去分，唐纳利太太说，她真是太好了，带了这么大一袋子蛋糕来，就让所有的孩子都说：","Everybody said: “O, here’s Maria!” when she came to Joe’s house.Joe was there, having come home from business, and all the children had their Sunday dresses on.There were two big girls in from next door and games were going on.Maria gave the bag of cakes to the eldest boy, Alphy, to divide and Mrs. Donnelly said it was too good of her to bring such a big bag of cakes and made all the children say:"
"“谢谢，玛丽亚。”","“Thanks, Maria.”"
"可玛丽亚却说她还带来了特别的东西给爸爸和妈妈，他们肯定会喜欢，然后她开始寻找她买的葡萄干蛋糕。她查看了唐斯糕饼店的袋子，接着在她那件雨衣的口袋里找，然后又在门厅衣帽台上找，但是在哪儿都没找到那块蛋糕。然后她询问了所有的孩子是不是他们中的哪一个已经把它吃掉了——当然是搞错了——可孩子们却都说没有，一想到要被指责偷吃了蛋糕，他们便都摆出一副不爱吃蛋糕的样子。每个人对这次神秘事件都有自己的解释，唐纳利太太说很明显玛丽亚是把蛋糕落在有轨电车上了。想起那位灰胡子绅士把她弄得那么稀里糊涂，玛丽亚脸红了，满心的羞愧、烦恼和失望。一想到自己想好的小小惊喜没戏了，还有她花出去却什么都没换来的两先令四便士，玛丽亚差点当时就大哭起来。","But Maria said she had brought something special for papa and mamma, something they would be sure to like, and she began to look for her plumcake.She tried in Downes’s bag and then in the pockets of her waterproof and then on the hallstand but nowhere could she find it.Then she asked all the children had any of them eaten it—by mistake, of course—but the children all said no and looked as if they did not like to eat cakes if they were to be accused of stealing.Everybody had a solution for the mystery and Mrs. Donnelly said it was plain that Maria had left it behind her in the tram.Maria, remembering how confused the gentleman with the greyish moustache had made her, coloured with shame and vexation and disappointment.At the thought of the failure of her little surprise and of the two and fourpence she had thrown away for nothing she nearly cried outright."
"不过乔却说那不要紧，然后让她在火炉边坐了下来。他对她非常好。他给她讲自己办公室里发生的一切，反复说到他向经理作出的一个巧妙的回答。玛丽亚不理解为何乔会因为他作出的那个回答而笑得那么忘情，不过她说那个经理一定是一个专横傲慢不好相处的人。乔说要是你知道如何对付他，他就还没有那么坏，只要你不惹怒他，他还算是一个正派的人。唐纳利太太为孩子们弹钢琴，而他们则又是跳舞又是唱歌。然后那两个邻家女孩给大家分了坚果。可谁都找不着坚果夹子，乔快要为这个生气了，责问他们如何能让玛丽亚不用坚果夹子就弄开那些坚果。但玛丽亚却说她不喜欢坚果，所以他们不用为她费事了。然后乔问她想不想喝一瓶黑啤酒，唐纳利太太也说如果她喜欢的话，家里还有波尔图葡萄酒。玛丽亚说她宁愿他们不要再问她想喝什么东西了：但乔却执意让她喝。","But Joe said it didn’t matter and made her sit down by the fire.He was very nice with her.He told her all that went on in his office, repeating for her a smart answer which he had made to the manager.Maria did not understand why Joe laughed so much over the answer he had made but she said that the manager must have been a very overbearing person to deal with.Joe said he wasn’t so bad when you knew how to take him, that he was a decent sort so long as you didn’t rub him the wrong way.Mrs. Donnelly played the piano for the children and they danced and sang.Then the two next-door girls handed round the nuts.Nobody could find the nutcrackers and Joe was nearly getting cross over it and asked how did they expect Maria to crack nuts without a nutcracker.But Maria said she didn’t like nuts and that they weren’t to bother about her.Then Joe asked would she take a bottle of stout and Mrs. Donnelly said there was port wine too in the house if she would prefer that.Maria said she would rather they didn’t ask her to take anything: but Joe insisted."
"于是玛丽亚就让他自行其是了，他们坐在火炉边，谈论着过去的时光，玛丽亚想她应该为阿尔菲说句好话。可乔却喊叫着说，他要是再跟他的兄弟说一句话，上帝很可能就会用石头把他砸死，玛丽亚说她很抱歉提起了这件事。唐纳利太太告诉她的丈夫说，他那样说自己的亲人真是很大的羞耻，但是乔却说阿尔菲根本不是他的兄弟，说到这一点，他们差点吵了起来。不过乔说考虑到这是个特别的晚上，所以他不会发脾气，他让妻子又打开了几瓶黑啤酒。那两个邻家女孩已经安排了一些万圣节前夜的游戏，很快一切又都变得欢快起来。玛丽亚很高兴看到孩子们能如此开心，乔和他的妻子的兴致也能这么好。邻家女孩把一些碟子放在桌子上，然后引着蒙上眼睛的孩子们走到桌子跟前。一个摸到了祈祷书，另外三个摸到了水；当其中一个邻家女孩摸到了那枚戒指，唐纳利太太冲着那个满脸羞红的女孩晃着一根手指，仿佛在说：哦，我可全都知道了！然后他们坚持要蒙上玛丽亚的眼睛，引她到桌子跟前，看看她会摸到什么；在他们给她缠绑带的时候，玛丽亚笑个不停，直笑得她的鼻尖几乎挨住了她的下巴尖。","So Maria let him have his way and they sat by the fire talking over old times and Maria thought she would put in a good word for Alphy.But Joe cried that God might strike him stone dead if ever he spoke a word to his brother again and Maria said she was sorry she had mentioned the matter.Mrs. Donnelly told her husband it was a great shame for him to speak that way of his own flesh and blood but Joe said that Alphy was no brother of his and there was nearly being a row on the head of it.But Joe said he would not lose his temper on account of the night it was and asked his wife to open some more stout.The two next-door girls had arranged some Hallow Eve games and soon everything was merry again.Maria was delighted to see the children so merry and Joe and his wife in such good spirits.The next-door girls put some saucers on the table and then led the children up to the table, blindfold.One got the prayer-book and the other three got the water; and when one of the next-door girls got the ring Mrs. Donnelly shook her finger at the blushing girl as much as to say: O, I know all about it!They insisted then on blindfolding Maria and leading her up to the table to see what she would get; and, while they were putting on the bandage, Maria laughed and laughed again till the tip of her nose nearly met the tip of her chin."
"在一片说笑打趣声中，他们引她走到桌子旁边，有人告诉她伸出一只手，她照办了。她在空中四下划拉着那只手，最后落在了其中一只碟子上。她的手指触摸到了一种柔软湿润的东西，但让她惊讶的是没有人说话或者摘掉她的绑带。停滞了有几秒钟的时间；然后是一阵慌乱和低语声。有人说了有关花园的什么事，最后唐纳利太太非常生气地对其中一个邻家女孩说了什么，叫她立刻把那个东西扔出去：这可不是玩的。玛丽亚明白这次她摸错了，于是她不得不重来一次：这一次她摸到了祈祷书。","They led her up to the table amid laughing and joking and she put her hand out in the air as she was told to do.She moved her hand about here and there in the air and descended on one of the saucers.She felt a soft wet substance with her fingers and was surprised that nobody spoke or took off her bandage.There was a pause for a few seconds; and then a great deal of scuffling and whispering.Somebody said something about the garden, and at last Mrs. Donnelly said something very cross to one of the next-door girls and told her to throw it out at once: that was no play.Maria understood that it was wrong that time and so she had to do it over again: and this time she got the prayer-book."
"这个游戏之后，唐纳利太太为孩子们演奏了《麦克劳德小姐的里尔舞曲》，而乔则让玛丽亚喝了一杯葡萄酒。很快他们又都变得十分开心，唐纳利太太说今年结束之前玛丽亚肯定会进修道院，因为她摸到了祈祷书。玛丽亚以前从来没见过乔对她那么好，全都是些舒心的话语和惬意的回忆。她说他们都对她非常好。","After that Mrs. Donnelly played Miss McCloud’s Reel for the children and Joe made Maria take a glass of wine.Soon they were all quite merry again and Mrs. Donnelly said Maria would enter a convent before the year was out because she had got the prayer-book.Maria had never seen Joe so nice to her as he was that night, so full of pleasant talk and reminiscences.She said they were all very good to her."
"最后，孩子们变得又累又困，乔问玛丽亚走之前想不想唱上一首小曲，唱首老歌。唐纳利太太说“请来一首吧，玛丽亚！”于是，玛丽亚不得不起身站到钢琴旁边。唐纳利太太吩咐孩子们安静下来，听玛丽亚唱歌。接着她弹了前奏曲，然后说道“唱，玛丽亚！”，玛丽亚羞得满脸通红，开始用细小颤抖的声音唱了起来。她唱了《我梦见我居住的地方》，当她唱到第二段时，她又唱道：","At last the children grew tired and sleepy and Joe asked Maria would she not sing some little song before she went, one of the old songs.Mrs. Donnelly said “Do, please, Maria!” and so Maria had to get up and stand beside the piano.Mrs. Donnelly bade the children be quiet and listen to Maria’s song.Then she played the prelude and said “Now, Maria!” and Maria, blushing very much began to sing in a tiny quavering voice.She sang I Dreamt that I Dwelt, and when she came to the second verse she sang again:"
"我梦见我住在大理石厅堂，随从和奴仆在我身旁，在聚集在墙内的所有人中，我就是骄傲和希望。","I dreamt that I dwelt in marble halls With vassals and serfs at my side, And of all who assembled within those walls That I was the hope and the pride."
"我有财富多得数不清；还可夸耀祖先的高贵声名，可我也梦见了最让我开心的事情，那就是你爱我一如往昔。","I had riches too great to count; could boast Of a high ancestral name, But I also dreamt, which pleased me most, That you loved me still the same."
"但是没有人想指出她的错误；当她唱完歌的时候，乔非常感动。他说任何时候都比不上从前，任何音乐对他来说都比不上可怜的老巴尔夫的音乐，无论别人会怎么说；他的眼睛盈满了泪水，以至于他无法找到自己要找的东西，最后他不得不让他的妻子告诉他开瓶器在哪里。","But no one tried to show her her mistake; and when she had ended her song Joe was very much moved.He said that there was no time like the long ago and no music for him like poor old Balfe, whatever other people might say; and his eyes filled up so much with tears that he could not find what he was looking for and in the end he had to ask his wife to tell him where the corkscrew was."
"第十一章 一桩惨事","CHAPTER 11 A PAINFUL CASE"
"詹姆斯·达菲先生居住在查普里佐德，因为他希望住得离他加入市籍的那座城市尽可能远一些，因为他发现都柏林的其他市郊地区无一不是鄙俗、摩登而矫饰。他住在一栋古老肃穆的房子里，从住所的窗户他可以看到那座废弃的酒厂，或者可以往上，沿着流过都柏林的那条浅河望过去。他的房间里没有铺地毯，高耸的墙壁上没有挂任何画。他亲自购买了房间里的每一件家具：一个黑色的铁床架，一个铁制的盥洗台，四把藤椅，一个衣架，一个煤筐，一个炉栅以及几件铁器，还有一张方桌，上面搁着一个双层文件架。在一个壁凹里，已经用白木板搭好了一个书架。卧床用白色的床单罩着，一块黑红相间的小地毯铺放在床脚处。一小面手镜挂在盥洗台上方，在白天，一盏带有白色灯罩的台灯作为唯一的装饰立在壁炉架上。白色木制书架上的书按照厚薄由下往上摆放着。一套华兹华斯全集立在最下层架子的一端，一本装订在一个笔记本的布面封皮里的《梅努斯教理问答手册》立在顶层架子的一端。写字用的物什总是摆在书桌上。书桌里放着一份手稿，是豪普特曼的《米夏埃尔·克莱默》的译文，其中的舞台提示是用紫墨水写成的，还有一沓纸片用一个铜别针别在一起。这些纸片中有一句话总是时不时地出现，在一种颇具讽刺意味的情况下，一则胆汁药末广告的标题会贴在第一张上。掀起书桌的盖子，一股淡淡的香味就会飘出来——这种香味可能出自新的松木铅笔，或是一瓶胶水，甚或是被人遗忘在那里的一个熟透了的苹果。","MR. JAMES DUFFY lived in Chapelizod because he wished to live as far as possible from the city of which he was a citizen and because he found all the other suburbs of Dublin mean, modern and pretentious.He lived in an old sombre house and from his windows he could look into the disused distillery or upwards along the shallow river on which Dublin is built.The lofty walls of his uncarpeted room were free from pictures.He had himself bought every article of furniture in the room: a black iron bedstead, an iron washstand, four cane chairs, a clothes-rack, a coal-scuttle, a fender and irons and a square table on which lay a double desk.A bookcase had been made in an alcove by means of shelves of white wood.The bed was clothed with white bedclothes and a black and scarlet rug covered the foot.A little hand-mirror hung above the washstand and during the day a white-shaded lamp stood as the sole ornament of the mantelpiece.The books on the white wooden shelves were arranged from below upwards according to bulk.A complete Wordsworth stood at one end of the lowest shelf and a copy of the Maynooth Catechism, sewn into the cloth cover of a notebook, stood at one end of the top shelf.Writing materials were always on the desk.In the desk lay a manuscript translation of Hauptmann’s Michael Kramer, the stage directions of which were written in purple ink, and a little sheaf of papers held together by a brass pin. In these sheets a sentence was inscribed from time to time and, in an ironical moment, the headline of an advertisement for Bile Beans had been pasted on to the first sheet.On lifting the lid of the desk a faint fragrance escaped—the fragrance of new cedarwood pencils or of a bottle of gum or of an overripe apple which might have been left there and forgotten."
"达菲先生憎恶任何物质或精神上的无序状态。一个中世纪的医师可能会形容他为受土星影响的乖戾之人。他的脸承载了他全部的岁月往事，呈现出都柏林街道所具有的那种褐色基调。在他那长而偏大的脑袋上长着干干的黑发，一撮黄褐色的唇髭并没有完全遮盖住那张并不和善的嘴。他的颧骨也给他的脸增添了一种严厉的特点；不过在那双眼睛里倒没有任何严厉的神情，它们从黄褐色的眉毛下看着这个世界，给人的印象是一个一直保持警惕的人，他想要从别人身上找到那种救赎的本能，但却常常感到失望。他的生活和自己的躯体有点儿距离，他总是带着疑惑的侧目镜审视着自己的行为。他有一个给自己立传的怪异习惯，这时不时地让他不由得就会在脑子里构思关于自己的一个短句，包含一个第三人称的主语和一个过去时态的谓语。他从来不施舍乞丐，手里总是拿着一根结实的榛木手杖，走起路来坚定有力。","Mr. Duffy abhorred anything which betokened physical or mental disorder.A mediaeval doctor would have called him saturnine.His face, which carried the entire tale of his years, was of the brown tint of Dublin streets.On his long and rather large head grew dry black hair and a tawny moustache did not quite cover an unamiable mouth.His cheekbones also gave his face a harsh character; but there was no harshness in the eyes which, looking at the world from under their tawny eyebrows, gave the impression of a man ever alert to greet a redeeming instinct in others but often disappointed.He lived at a little distance from his body, regarding his own acts with doubtful side-glasses.He had an odd autobiographical habit which led him to compose in his mind from time to time a short sentence about himself containing a subject in the third person and a predicate in the past tense.He never gave alms to beggars and walked firmly, carrying a stout hazel."
"他已经在巴戈特街上的一家私人银行做了许多年的出纳员。每天早上他都乘坐有轨电车从查普里佐德到城里来。中午的时候，他会去丹·伯克店里用午餐——一瓶贮藏啤酒和一小碟竹芋饼干。下午四点他就解放了。然后他会在乔治街上的一家餐馆用晚餐，在那里，他感到自己可以远离都柏林上流社会富有青年结成的那个社交圈子，在那里，餐费单上都透着某种朴实的真诚。每天晚上的时间，他或者是在房东太太的钢琴前面度过，或者是在这座城市的郊区四处漫游。他喜爱莫扎特的音乐，所以他有时会去看一出歌剧或听一场音乐会：这些是他生活中唯一的奢侈享受。","He had been for many years cashier of a private bank in Baggot Street.Every morning he came in from Chapelizod by tram.At midday he went to Dan Burke’s and took his lunch—a bottle of lager beer and a small trayful of arrowroot biscuits.At four o’clock he was set free.He dined in an eating-house in George’s Street where he felt himself safe from the society of Dublin’s gilded youth and where there was a certain plain honesty in the bill of fare.His evenings were spent either before his landlady’s piano or roaming about the outskirts of the city.His liking for Mozart’s music brought him sometimes to an opera or a concert: these were the only dissipations of his life."
"他既没有伴侣也没有朋友，既不信教也没有信仰。他过着自己的精神生活，和其他人没有任何交流，圣诞节时他会去拜访亲戚，在他们去世的时候，他会护送他们到墓地去。他履行这两项社会义务是为了沿袭旧仪式，此外就不再向规范市民生活的惯例作任何让步。他总不由得在想，在特定情况下他会抢了自己工作的那家银行，不过，因为这类情况从来没有出现过，所以他的生活一直都是平稳地向前行进着——一个没有冒险的故事。","He had neither companions nor friends, church nor creed.He lived his spiritual life without any communion with others, visiting his relatives at Christmas and escorting them to the cemetery when they died.He performed these two social duties for old dignity’s sake but conceded nothing further to the conventions which regulate the civic life.He allowed himself to think that in certain circumstances he would rob his hank but, as these circumstances never arose, his life rolled out evenly—an adventureless tale."
"一天晚上，在圆形剧场里，他发现自己坐在了两位女士的旁边。剧场里稀稀落落地坐着几个人，一片寂静，预示着演出不幸的失败。挨着他坐的那位女士环顾了这冷清的场面一两次，然后说道：","One evening he found himself sitting beside two ladies in the Rotunda.The house, thinly peopled and silent, gave distressing prophecy of failure.The lady who sat next him looked round at the deserted house once or twice and then said:"
"“真可怜，今晚的票房怎么这么差！不得不对着空座椅来演唱真是让人太难受了。”","“What a pity there is such a poor house tonight!It’s so hard on people to have to sing to empty benches.”"
"他把这句评论看作是开始谈话的一种邀请。他很惊讶，她似乎一点儿都不尴尬。在他们谈话的过程中，他努力想把她牢牢地固定在自己的记忆中。当他得知坐在她身边的那个年轻姑娘是她的女儿时，他判断她大概比自己要年轻一岁左右。她的脸肯定曾经很标致，现在也仍然很灵秀。那是一张椭圆形的脸庞，五官非常分明。深蓝色的眼睛里有坚定的神情。它们在凝视的时候，开始会带有一种挑衅的意味，不过很快就变得迷惑起来，瞳孔似乎故意地缩入虹膜，瞬时呈现出一种极度敏感的气质。很快瞳孔又恢复了原状，这种半遮半掩的本性又被审慎占据，她那件羔羊皮夹克上衣凸显出她那颇为丰满的胸部，更加明确地传达出了那种挑衅的意味。","He took the remark as an invitation to talk.He was surprised that she seemed so little awkward.While they talked he tried to fix her permanently in his memory.When he learned that the young girl beside her was her daughter he judged her to be a year or so younger than himself.Her face, which must have been handsome, had remained intelligent.It was an oval face with strongly marked features.The eyes were very dark blue and steady.Their gaze began with a defiant note but was confused by what seemed a deliberate swoon of the pupil into the iris, revealing for an instant a temperament of great sensibility.The pupil reasserted itself quickly, this half-disclosed nature fell again under the reign of prudence, and her astrakhan jacket, moulding a bosom of a certain fullness, struck the note of defiance more definitely."
"几周之后在厄尔斯福特平台举办的一场音乐会上他又遇见了她，他抓住她女儿注意力转移的时刻跟她熟识了起来。她有一两次提到了她的丈夫，不过她的语调听起来并不像是要利用这一点来作为警告。她的名号是辛尼科夫人。她丈夫的曾曾祖父来自利伏诺。她丈夫是来往于都柏林和荷兰之间的一艘商船的船长；他们只有一个孩子。","He met her again a few weeks afterwards at a concert in Earlsfort Terrace and seized the moments when her daughter’s attention was diverted to become intimate.She alluded once or twice to her husband but her tone was not such as to make the allusion a warning.Her name was Mrs. Sinico.Her husband’s great-great-grandfather had come from Leghorn.Her husband was captain of a mercantile boat plying between Dublin and Holland; and they had one child."
"在第三次偶然遇见她时，他终于有了约她的勇气。她来了。这是第一次见面，后来又见过许多次；他们总是在晚上见面，挑最安静的街区一块散步。然而达菲先生却不喜欢这些偷偷摸摸的方式，当他发现他们只能秘密地见面时，他便要求她邀请自己去她家。辛尼科船长倒很欢迎他的到访，觉得女儿有可能会名花有主了。他已经非常实诚地把妻子从享受这件事的人中剔除了出去，因此他根本没有想到别的什么人会对她感兴趣。由于这位丈夫常常不在，而他们的女儿也总是出去带音乐课，因此达菲先生就有许多机会来享受这位女士的陪伴。他和她都从来没有过如此冒险的经历，两人谁都没有意识到会有什么不合适。渐渐地，他让自己的思想和她的交融在了一起。他借给她书，给她传授各种思想，把自己的精神生活与她分享。她聆听着一切。","Meeting her a third time by accident he found courage to make an appointment.She came.This was the first of many meetings; they met always in the evening and chose the most quiet quarters for their walks together.Mr. Duffy, however, had a distaste for underhand ways and, finding that they were compelled to meet stealthily, he forced her to ask him to her house.Captain Sinico encouraged his visits, thinking that his daughter’s hand was in question.He had dismissed his wife so sincerely from his gallery of pleasures that he did not suspect that anyone else would take an interest in her.As the husband was often away and the daughter out giving music lessons Mr. Duffy had many opportunities of enjoying the lady’s society.Neither he nor she had had any such adventure before and neither was conscious of any incongruity.Little by little he entangled his thoughts with hers.He lent her books, provided her with ideas, shared his intellectual life with her.She listened to all."
"有时，作为对他那些理论的回报，她会讲述自己生活中的一些情况。带着几近于母性的关怀，她敦促他完全敞开自己的天性：她俨然成了他的告解神父。他告诉她说，有一段时间，他曾在一个名叫“爱尔兰社会主义者党”的组织会议中帮过忙，在那间点着一盏昏暗油灯的阁楼里，身处于二十多个保守持重的工人中间，他感觉自己是颇为独特的一个人。当那个党派分裂成三派的时候，每一派都有了自己的领导，都有了各自的阁楼，于是他也就不再参与其中了。工人们的讨论，他说，有些过于谨小慎微了；他们对薪资问题的兴趣却又放纵无度。他觉得他们都是些容貌粗陋的现实主义者，他们憎恨那种严格精确的做派，那是不在他们触及范围之内的休闲所产生的结果。他告诉她说，在几个世纪里都不可能会有什么社会革命降临都柏林。","Sometimes in return for his theories she gave out some fact of her own life.With almost maternal solicitude she urged him to let his nature open to the full: she became his confessor.He told her that for some time he had assisted at the meetings of an Irish Socialist Party where he had felt himself a unique figure amidst a score of sober workmen in a garret lit by an inefficient oil-lamp.When the party had divided into three sections, each under its own leader and in its own garret, he had discontinued his attendances.The workmen’s discussions, he said, were too timorous; the interest they took in the question of wages was inordinate.He felt that they were hard-featured realists and that they resented an exactitude which was the produce of a leisure not within their reach.No social revolution, he told her, would be likely to strike Dublin for some centuries."
"她问他为何不把自己的想法写下来。为什么要写呢，他带着谨慎的嘲讽语气反问她。为了去和那些根本没有能力连续思考六十秒钟、辞藻华丽但言之无物的人竞争吗？为了让自己去接受一个把道德委托给警察、把艺术委托给歌舞剧团经理、感觉迟钝的中产阶级的品评吗？","She asked him why did he not write out his thoughts.For what, he asked her, with careful scorn.To compete with phrasemongers, incapable of thinking consecutively for sixty seconds?To submit himself to the criticisms of an obtuse middle class which entrusted its morality to policemen and its fine arts to impresarios?"
"他常常去她都柏林郊外的那间小屋；他们常常单独在那里过夜。渐渐地，随着他们的思想交融在一起，他们谈论的话题也不再那么疏远。她的陪伴就像是奇异植物周围的温热土壤。许多次她任由黑暗降临在他们周围，却不想去点亮灯火。黑暗幽静的房间，他们那与世隔绝的状态，还有那仍然颤响在他们耳畔的音乐，把他们结合在了一起。这种结合升华了他，磨掉了他性格中的棱角，使他的精神生活带上了感情色彩。有时他发现自己在聆听自己说话的声音。他认为，在她眼里，他会升格成为一个天使般的人物；当他把伴侣的热情天性越来越近地依附于自己的时候，他听到那个古怪冷漠的声音（他辨识出那是自己的声音）在反复述说着他这颗灵魂不可救药的孤独。我们无法奉献自己，那个声音说：我们是属于自己的。一天晚上辛尼科夫人（她整晚都表现得异常兴奋）充满激情地抓住他的一只手，然后把它贴在了自己的面颊上，这成了他们交流的终结。","He went often to her little cottage outside Dublin; often they spent their evenings alone.Little by little, as their thoughts entangled, they spoke of subjects less remote.Her companionship was like a warm soil about an exotic.Many times she allowed the dark to fall upon them, refraining from lighting the lamp.The dark discreet room, their isolation, the music that still vibrated in their ears united them.This union exalted him, wore away the rough edges of his character, emotionalised his mental life.Sometimes he caught himself listening to the sound of his own voice.He thought that in her eyes he would ascend to an angelical stature; and, as he attached the fervent nature of his companion more and more closely to him, he heard the strange impersonal voice which he recognised as his own, insisting on the soul’s incurable loneliness.We cannot give ourselves, it said: we are our own.The end of these discourses was that one night during which she had shown every sign of unusual excitement, Mrs. Sinico caught up his hand passionately and pressed it to her cheek."
"达菲先生非常吃惊。她对他所说的话作出如此解读使他醒悟了过来。有一个星期他没有去拜访她，然后他写信给她请她来和自己见面。他们之间那种相互告解已遭到破坏，他不希望他们最后这次见面会受此搅扰，于是他们就在公园门口附近的一家小糕饼店里见了面。当时是寒冷的秋天，不过尽管天气寒冷，他们还是沿着公园的道路来来回回走了将近三个小时。他们说好了中断来往：每一种束缚，他说，都会带来痛苦。他们从公园出来，沉默无语地朝有轨电车走去；可到了那儿之后，她开始剧烈地颤抖起来，他害怕她会再一次失控，于是就匆忙向她道别，离他而去。几天之后，他收到了一个包裹，里面装着他的书和乐谱。","Mr. Duffy was very much surprised.Her interpretation of his words disillusioned him.He did not visit her for a week, then he wrote to her asking her to meet him. As he did not wish their last interview to be troubled by the influence of their ruined confessional they meet in a little cakeshop near the Parkgate.It was cold autumn weather but in spite of the cold they wandered up and down the roads of the Park for nearly three hours.They agreed to break off their intercourse: every bond, he said, is a bond to sorrow.When they came out of the Park they walked in silence towards the tram; but here she began to tremble so violently that, fearing another collapse on her part, he bade her good-bye quickly and left her.A few days later he received a parcel containing his books and music."
"四年过去了。达菲先生又恢复了他那平静的生活方式。他的房间依然见证着他头脑的有条不紊。下房里的乐谱架上多了一些新的乐谱，他的书架上立着尼采的两大本著作：《查拉图斯特拉如是说》和《快乐的科学》。他很少往放在书桌上的那沓纸片上写东西。他写的那些句子里有一句（那是他和辛尼科夫人最后一次见面的两个月后写成的）是这样写道：男人与男人之间不可能有爱情，因为他们不能性交；男人与女人之间不可能有友情，因为他们必须性交。他不再去听音乐会，以免会遇见她。他的父亲死了；银行的那个初级合伙人退休了。每天早晨，他依然坐有轨电车进城，每天傍晚在乔治街吃一顿有节制的晚餐、读着晚报享用完甜点之后，他依然会从城里步行回家。","Four years passed.Mr. Duffy returned to his even way of life.His room still bore witness of the orderliness of his mind.Some new pieces of music encumbered the music-stand in the lower room and on his shelves stood two volumes by Nietzsche: Thus Spake Zarathustra and The Gay Science.He wrote seldom in the sheaf of papers which lay in his desk.One of his sentences, written two months after his last interview with Mrs. Sinico, read: Love between man and man is impossible because there must not be sexual intercourse and friendship between man and woman is impossible because there must be sexual intercourse.He kept away from concerts lest he should meet her.His father died; the junior partner of the bank retired.And still every morning he went into the city by tram and every evening walked home from the city after having dined moderately in George’s Street and read the evening paper for dessert."
"一天傍晚，正当他要把一小口咸牛肉加卷心菜塞进嘴里的时候，他的手一下子停住了。他的目光固定在了他靠着水瓶竖放着的那张晚报上的一段报道。他把那一小口食物又放回盘子上，聚精会神地读起那段文字来。然后他喝了一杯水，把盘子推到一边，把报纸对折摆到自己面前双肘之间，一遍又一遍地读着那段文字。盘子上的卷心菜开始变冷，结成了一层白色的油脂。女服务员走到他面前问他晚餐是不是做得不好。他说饭非常好，然后又勉强吃了几口。接着他付了账单，走了出去。","One evening as he was about to put a morsel of corned beef and cabbage into his mouth his hand stopped.His eyes fixed themselves on a paragraph in the evening paper which he had propped against the water-carafe.He replaced the morsel of food on his plate and read the paragraph attentively.Then he drank a glass of water, pushed his plate to one side, doubled the paper down before him between his elbows and read the paragraph over and over again.The cabbage began to deposit a cold white grease on his plate.The girl came over to him to ask was his dinner not properly cooked.He said it was very good and ate a few mouthfuls of it with difficulty.Then he paid his bill and went out."
"他在十一月的夜色中匆匆前行，他那结实的榛木手杖有规律地敲击着地面，浅黄褐色《邮报》的一角从他那件紧身双排扣呢外套的侧袋里露了出来。在从公园门口通往查普里佐德的那条寂静道路上，他放慢了脚步。他的手杖敲击地面的力度减弱了，他的呼吸很不均匀，几乎带着一种叹息的声音，凝结在冬日的空气里。到达住所之后，他立刻上楼进到卧室，从口袋里取出那张报纸，借着窗户愈见暗弱的光线又开始读起那段文字来。他读的时候并没有出声，但却像一个神父念分祷词那样噏动着双唇。那段文字是这样的：","He walked along quickly through the November twilight, his stout hazel stick striking the ground regularly, the fringe of the buff Mail peeping out of a side-pocket of his tight reefer overcoat.On the lonely road which leads from the Parkgate to Chapelizod he slackened his pace.His stick struck the ground less emphatically and his breath, issuing irregularly, almost with a sighing sound, condensed in the wintry air. When he reached his house he went up at once to his bedroom and, taking the paper from his pocket, read the paragraph again by the failing light of the window.He read it not aloud, but moving his lips as a priest does when he reads the prayers Secreto.This was the paragraph:"
"悉尼街一位女士之死：一桩惨事","DEATH of A LADY AT SYDNEY PARADE A PAINFUL CASE"
"今天，在都柏林市立医院，代理验尸官（莱弗里特先生未到场）对埃米莉·辛尼科夫人的尸体进行了勘验。死者现年四十三岁，昨晚在悉尼街车站被撞身亡。证据表明，这位死去的女士在试图穿越轨道时被从金斯敦开来的十点钟慢车车头撞倒，头部和身体右侧受伤，最后导致其死亡。","Today at the City of Dublin Hospital the Deputy Coroner (in the absence of Mr. Leverett) held an inquest on the body of Mrs. Emily Sinico, aged forty-three years, who was killed at Sydney Parade Station yesterday evening.The evidence showed that the deceased lady, while attempting to cross the line, was knocked down by the engine of the ten o’clock slow train from Kingstown, thereby sustaining injuries of the head and right side which led to her death."
"机车司机詹姆斯·列侬称他受雇于铁路公司已经十五年了。一听到列车长的哨声，他就启动了火车，一两秒钟之后又让它停了下来，因为听到了大声的喊叫声。火车是缓慢行驶的。","James Lennon, driver of the engine, stated that he had been in the employment of the railway company for fifteen years.On hearing the guard’s whistle he set the train in motion and a second or two afterwards brought it to rest in response to loud cries.The train was going slowly."
"铁路搬运工P·邓恩称，当火车正要启动时，他注意到一位妇女正试图穿越轨道。他朝她跑去，喊叫着，但在他抓到她之前她就被机车的减震器挂住栽倒在地。","P. Dunne, railway porter, stated that as the train was about to start he observed a woman attempting to cross the lines.He ran towards her and shouted, but, before he could reach her, she was caught by the buffer of the engine and fell to the ground."
"一位陪审员。“你看到那位女士倒下了？”","A juror.“You saw the lady fall?”"
"证人。“是的。”","Witness.“Yes.”"
"警佐克罗利作证说，他到达那里的时候，他看到死者躺在月台上，很明显已经死亡。他让人把尸体抬到候车室，等待救护车的到来。","Police Sergeant Croly deposed that when he arrived he found the deceased lying on the platform apparently dead.He had the body taken to the waiting-room pending the arrival of the ambulance."
"57号警官也提供了证据。","Constable 57 corroborated."
"哈尔平医生（都柏林市立医院的助理住院外科医师）称，死者下面的两根肋骨骨折，右肩则遭受了严重的挫伤。头部右侧在摔倒的时候也受了伤。这些损伤并不足以导致一个正常人死亡。在他看来，死因很可能是受到惊吓而导致的心脏功能的突然衰竭。","Dr. Halpin, assistant house surgeon of the City of Dublin Hospital, stated that the deceased had two lower ribs fractured and had sustained severe contusions of the right shoulder.The right side of the head had been injured in the fall.The injuries were not sufficient to have caused death in a normal person.Death, in his opinion, had been probably due to shock and sudden failure of the heart’s action."
"H. B. 帕特森·芬利先生代表铁路公司对这起事故深表遗憾。公司一直都采取一切防范措施来防止行人不走天桥而横穿轨道，在每个车站都设有警示牌，在平行路口处还采用了专利弹簧门。死者已经习惯了在深夜横穿轨道从一个站台到另一个站台去，结合这起事件的其他情况来看，他认为铁路官员们不应该承担责任。","Mr. H. B. Patterson Finlay, on behalf of the railway company, expressed his deep regret at the accident.The company had always taken every precaution to prevent people crossing the lines except by the bridges, both by placing notices in every station and by the use of patent spring gates at level crossings.The deceased had been in the habit of crossing the lines late at night from platform to platform and, in view of certain other circumstances of the case, he did not think the railway officials were to blame."
"悉尼街里奥维尔的辛尼科船长，即死者的丈夫，也提供了证词。他说死者是他的妻子。事故发生的时候他不在都柏林，那天早上他才刚刚从鹿特丹赶回来。他们已经结婚二十二年了，一直生活得很幸福，直到大概两年前，他的妻子开始养成了酗酒的习惯。","Captain Sinico, of Leoville, Sydney Parade, husband of the deceased, also gave evidence.He stated that the deceased was his wife.He was not in Dublin at the time of the accident as he had arrived only that morning from Rotterdam.They had been married for twenty-two years and had lived happily until about two years ago when his wife began to be rather intemperate in her habits."
"玛丽·辛尼科小姐说最近她母亲总习惯于晚上出去买酒。如今身为证人的她以前经常努力和母亲讲道理，并劝导她加入一个联合会。事故发生后一个小时她才回到家。陪审团按照医学证据提交了最终判决，判定列侬不承担任何责任。","Miss Mary Sinico said that of late her mother had been in the habit of going out at night to buy spirits.She, witness, had often tried to reason with her mother and had induced her to join a League.She was not at home until an hour after the accident.The jury returned a verdict in accordance with the medical evidence and exonerated Lennon from all blame."
"代理验尸官说，这是一起非常悲惨的事件，并对辛尼科船长和他的女儿表示了深切的同情。他敦促铁路公司采取强有力的措施以避免将来发生同类事故。没有任何人承担责任。","The Deputy Coroner said it was a most painful case, and expressed great sympathy with Captain Sinico and his daughter.He urged on the railway company to take strong measures to prevent the possibility of similar accidents in the future.No blame attached to anyone."
"达菲先生从报纸上抬眼凝望着窗外那毫无生气的夜景。那条河静静地躺在空荡荡的酒厂旁边，不时地会有一盏灯在卢肯路上的某栋房子里亮起。怎样的一个结局啊！关于她死亡的整个报道让他反感，想起曾经向她谈及自己尊崇为神圣的东西也让他反感。那些老生常谈的词语，那些愚蠢空洞的同情话，一个已被收买的记者将一起平常而粗俗的死亡事件的细节有所隐藏的谨慎说辞都刺激着他的胃。她不仅贬低了自己；她也贬低了他。他看到了她放纵的堕落轨迹，可悲而又可厌。他灵魂的伴侣！他想到了那些走路摇摇晃晃的可怜鬼，他曾经见过他们手里拿着瓶瓶罐罐让酒吧服务生给加满酒。公正的上帝，这是怎样的一种结局啊！显然她并不适合生存，没有任何意志力，很容易成为习惯的俘虏，她是文明催生的残骸之一。可是她竟然沦落到如此低下的地步！难道有可能他在对她的认识上彻底欺骗了自己？他回想起了那天晚上她的放任，然后以一种他采用过的最为严厉的方式对它进行了解读。现在，他很容易地就认可了自己当时选择的道路。","Mr. Duffy raised his eyes from the paper and gazed out of his window on the cheerless evening landscape.The river lay quiet beside the empty distillery and from time to time a light appeared in some house on the Lucan road.What an end!The whole narrative of her death revolted him and it revolted him to think that he had ever spoken to her of what he held sacred.The threadbare phrases, the inane expressions of sympathy, the cautious words of a reporter won over to conceal the details of a commonplace vulgar death attacked his stomach.Not merely had she degraded herself; she had degraded him.He saw the squalid tract of her vice, miserable and malodorous.His soul’s companion!He thought of the hobbling wretches whom he had seen carrying cans and bottles to be filled by the barman.Just God, what an end!Evidently she had been unfit to live, without any strength of purpose, an easy prey to habits, one of the wrecks on which civilisation has been reared.But that she could have sunk so low!Was it possible he had deceived himself so utterly about her?He remembered her outburst of that night and interpreted it in a harsher sense than he had ever done.He had no difficulty now in approving of the course he had taken."
"光线渐渐暗淡，他的记忆开始飘忽起来，他以为她的手在触摸自己的手。那种震惊最初刺激了他的胃，现在又开始刺激他的神经。他迅速穿戴上外套和帽子走了出去。在门槛处，冷空气迎面袭来，钻进了他的衣服袖子里。他来到查普里佐德桥附近的那家酒馆，进去点了一杯热潘趣酒。","As the light failed and his memory began to wander he thought her hand touched his.The shock which had first attacked his stomach was now attacking his nerves.He put on his overcoat and hat quickly and went out.The cold air met him on the threshold; it crept into the sleeves of his coat.When he came to the public-house at Chapelizod Bridge he went in and ordered a hot punch."
"老板殷勤地接待了他，但没敢说话。店里有五六名工人正在谈论一位绅士在基尔代尔郡的地产价值。他们一边不时地喝着他们那一品脱容量的大酒杯里的啤酒，一边抽着烟，经常往地板上吐痰，有时还会用他们那笨重的靴子划拉些锯末过来盖住他们吐的痰。达菲先生坐在凳子上凝视着他们，但却并没有看见他们，也没有听见他们的谈话。过了一会儿，他们出去了，而他又叫了一杯潘趣酒。他对着那杯酒坐了很长时间。店里非常安静。老板趴在柜台上，一边读着《先驱者报》，一边打着哈欠。不时会听到有某辆有轨电车呼啸着驶过外面那条寂寥的街道。","The proprietor served him obsequiously but did not venture to talk.There were five or six workingmen in the shop discussing the value of a gentleman’s estate in County Kildare. They drank at intervals from their huge pint tumblers and smoked, spitting often on the floor and sometimes dragging the sawdust over their spits with their heavy boots.Mr. Duffy sat on his stool and gazed at them, without seeing or hearing them.After a while they went out and he called for another punch.He sat a long time over it. The shop was very quiet.The proprietor sprawled on the counter reading the Herald and yawning.Now and again a tram was heard swishing along the lonely road outside."
"他坐在那里，回顾着和她一起度过的时光，交替回忆着他现在留存的她的两种形象，他意识到她死了，她已不复存在，她已成了一种记忆。他开始感到不安。他自问他本来还能做些别的什么。他本就不可能和她维持一场具有欺骗性质的喜剧；他本就不可能和她公开生活在一起。他做了对他来说似乎是最好的选择。如何能怪罪于他呢？现在她去了，他才明白她的生活曾经是多么孤独，整夜整夜独自坐在那个房间里。他的生活也将会是孤独的，直到他也死去，不复存在，变成一种回忆——如果有人还记着他的话。","As he sat there, living over his life with her and evoking alternately the two images in which he now conceived her, he realised that she was dead, that she had ceased to exist, that she had become a memory.He began to feel ill at ease.He asked himself what else could he have done.He could not have carried on a comedy of deception with her; he could not have lived with her openly.He had done what seemed to him best.How was he to blame?Now that she was gone he understood how lonely her life must have been, sitting night after night alone in that room.His life would be lonely too until he, too, died, ceased to exist, became a memory—if anyone remembered him."
"过了九点钟之后，他离开了那家店铺。夜晚寒冷而黑暗。他从最近的一个大门走进了公园，在凋落的树木下漫步前行。他穿行于四年前他们曾漫步过的那些荒凉的小路。黑暗中，她仿佛就在他的身边。不时地，他仿佛感觉到她的声音在触动他的耳膜，她的手在触碰他的手。他站住不动聆听了起来。为何他不给她生路呢？为何他要判她死刑呢？他感到自己的良知渐渐掉落成碎片。","It was after nine o’clock when he left the shop.The night was cold and gloomy.He entered the Park by the first gate and walked along under the gaunt trees.He walked through the bleak alleys where they had walked four years before.She seemed to be near him in the darkness.At moments he seemed to feel her voice touch his ear, her hand touch his.He stood still to listen.Why had he withheld life from her?Why had he sentenced her to death?He felt his moral nature falling to pieces."
"当他登上杂志山山顶的时候，他停下脚步，顺着河流朝都柏林的方向望去，那座城市的灯火在这寒冷的夜晚炽烈而热情地燃烧着。他朝山坡下望去，山脚处，在公园围墙的阴影里，他隐约看到有些人躺在那里。那些堕落的的、偷偷摸摸的情事让他内心充满了绝望。他啮噬着自己操行端正的生活；他感到自己已经被逐出了生活的盛宴。有一个人似曾爱过他，而他却夺去了她的生命和幸福：他害她名节不保，耻辱地死去。他知道下面围墙附近的躺着的那些人正看着他，期望着他能走开。没有人需要他；他已经被逐出了生活的盛宴。他把目光转向了那灰暗的、波光闪动的河面，河水朝着都柏林的方向蜿蜒流去。在河那边，他看到一列货运列车正蜿蜒着驶出金斯布里奇车站，仿佛一只头部火红的虫子正固执而艰难地蜿蜒着驶过黑暗。它缓慢地驶出了他的视野；不过他的耳畔仍然能听见机车那费力的轰鸣声一个一个音节地重复着她的名字。","When he gained the crest of the Magazine Hill he halted and looked along the river towards Dublin, the lights of which burned redly and hospitably in the cold night.He looked down the slope and, at the base, in the shadow of the wall of the Park, he saw some human figures lying.Those venal and furtive loves filled him with despair.He gnawed the rectitude of his life; he felt that he had been outcast from life’s feast.One human being had seemed to love him and he had denied her life and happiness: he had sentenced her to ignominy, a death of shame.He knew that the prostrate creatures down by the wall were watching him and wished him gone.No one wanted him; he was outcast from life’s feast.He turned his eyes to the grey gleaming river, winding along towards Dublin.Beyond the river he saw a goods train winding out of Kingsbridge Station, like a worm with a fiery head winding through the darkness, obstinately and laboriously.It passed slowly out of sight; but still he heard in his ears the laborious drone of the engine reiterating the syllables of her name."
"他转身走上了来时的路，机车的节奏在耳畔砰砰回响着。他开始怀疑记忆是否真实。他在一棵树下停住脚步，让那种节奏慢慢消散。黑暗中，他不再感觉到她就在身边，她的声音也不再触动他的耳膜。他等了好几分钟，侧耳聆听着。他什么都听不到：夜出奇地安静。他又听了听：出奇地安静。他感到自己是孤身一人。","He turned back the way he had come, the rhythm of the engine pounding in his ears.He began to doubt the reality of what memory told him.He halted under a tree and allowed the rhythm to die away.He could not feel her near him in the darkness nor her voice touch his ear.He waited for some minutes listening.He could hear nothing: the night was perfectly silent.He listened again: perfectly silent.He felt that he was alone."
"第十二章 委员会办公室里的常春藤日","CHAPTER 12 IVY DAY IN THE COMMITTEE ROOM"
"老杰克用一块纸板把煤灰撮起来，小心翼翼地撒在了正在变白的那堆拱起的炭火上。火堆被薄薄地盖了一层，他的脸随即隐入黑暗之中，不过，当他又开始扇火的时候，他那蹲伏着的身影就爬到了对面的墙上，他的脸又慢慢地出现在了亮光之下。这是一副老年人的面孔，非常清瘦，还有很多须毛。那双湿润的蓝眼睛冲着炉火眨动着，那张湿润的嘴间或会张开，闭上的时候总会机械地嚼动一两次。煤灰燃起来的时候，他把那张纸板靠墙放了起来，然后叹着气说道：","OLD JACK raked the cinders together with a piece of cardboard and spread them judiciously over the whitening dome of coals.When the dome was thinly covered his face lapsed into darkness but, as he set himself to fan the fire again, his crouching shadow ascended the opposite wall and his face slowly reemerged into light.It was an old man’s face, very bony and hairy.The moist blue eyes blinked at the fire and the moist mouth fell open at times, munching once or twice mechanically when it closed.When the cinders had caught he laid the piece of cardboard against the wall, sighed and said:"
"“这就好多了，奥康纳先生。”","“That’s better now, Mr. O’Connor.”"
"奥康纳先生是一个满头灰发的年轻人，他的脸让许多色斑和粉刺给弄得不成样子，他刚刚把烟叶卷成一个像样的圆柱形，可一听有人和他说话，他就若有所思地松开了他的这个手工艺品。随后他又开始若有所思地卷起了烟叶，片刻的沉思之后才决定舔湿那张卷烟纸。","Mr. O’Connor, a grey-haired young man, whose face was disfigured by many blotches and pimples, had just brought the tobacco for a cigarette into a shapely cylinder but when spoken to he undid his handiwork meditatively.Then he began to roll the tobacco again meditatively and after a moment’s thought decided to lick the paper."
"“蒂尔尼先生说了他什么时候回来吗？”他用嘶哑的假声问道。","“Did Mr. Tierney say when he’d be back?” he asked in a sky falsetto."
"“他没说。”","“He didn’t say.”"
"奥康纳先生把烟放到嘴里，然后开始摸索起口袋来。他掏出一叠薄薄的硬纸板卡片。","Mr. O’Connor put his cigarette into his mouth and began search his pockets.He took out a pack of thin pasteboard cards."
"“我去给你拿根火柴。”那个老人说道。","“I’ll get you a match,” said the old man."
"“不用了，这就可以。”奥康纳先生说。","“Never mind, this’ll do,” said Mr. O’Connor."
"他选了一张卡片，读着印在上面的内容：","He selected one of the cards and read what was printed on it:"
"市政选举——皇家交易所选区","MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS ————— ROYAL EXCHANGE WARD —————"
"理查德·J·蒂尔尼先生——济贫会委员——尊请您在即将举行的皇家交易所选区的选举中投票予以支持与帮助。","Mr. Richard J. Tierney, P.L.G., respectfully solicits the favour of your vote and influence at the coming election in the Royal Exchange Ward."
"奥康纳先生本来受蒂尔尼的选举代理人指派要去游说一部分选区的居民的，可是天气恶劣，他的靴子里进了水，因此这大半天的时间他是和老看门人杰克一起坐在位于威克洛街的委员会办公室的火炉边度过的。短暂的白天变黑之后，他们就一直这么坐着。今天是十月六日，屋外天气阴沉而寒冷。","Mr. O’Connor had been engaged by Tierney’s agent to canvass one part of the ward but, as the weather was inclement and his boots let in the wet, he spent a great part of the day sitting by the fire in the Committee Room in Wicklow Street with Jack, the old caretaker.They had been sitting thus since a short day had grown dark.It was the sixth of October, dismal and cold out of doors."
"奥康纳先生撕下一小片卡纸，点着了，又用它点着了自己的烟卷。他点烟的时候，火苗照亮了他大衣翻领上别着的一片深绿发亮的常春藤叶子。那个老人聚精会神地注视着他，然后又拿起那块纸板，在他的伙伴抽烟的时候开始慢慢地扇火。","Mr. O’Connor tore a strip off the card and, lighting it, lit his cigarette.As he did so the flame lit up a leaf of dark glossy ivy in the lapel of his coat.The old man watched him attentively and then, taking up the piece of cardboard again, began to fan the fire slowly while his companion smoked."
"“啊，是啊，”他接着先前的话头说道，“很难知道该用什么方法来抚养孩子们。如今谁会想到他会变成那样！我送他上基督教兄弟会办的学校，我为他倾尽全力，可他却在那儿瞎胡闹。我使劲想让他好歹能有点教养。”","“Ah, yes,” he said, continuing, “it’s hard to know what way to bring up children.Now who’d think he’d turn out like that!I sent him to the Christian Brothers and I done what I could him, and there he goes boosing about.I tried to make him someway decent.”"
"他疲惫地把纸板放了回去。","He replaced the cardboard wearily."
"“只是我现在老了，要不我真想给他改改调子。要是我还能看住他，我真想拿棍子朝他的背上抽一顿——过去我曾这样做过好多次。可当妈的，你知道，她总是这样那样地哄他高兴……”","“Only I’m an old man now I’d change his tune for him.I’d take the stick to his back and beat him while I could stand over him—as I done many a time before.The mother, you know, she cocks him up with this and that....”"
"“这样可就惯坏孩子们了。”奥康纳先生说。","“That’s what ruins children,” said Mr. O’Connor."
"“的确是这样，”那个老人说，“而且你那样做得到的几乎没有感激，只有傲慢无礼。每次他见我喝一小口酒都会骑到我头上来喝斥我。儿子跟父亲这样说话，真不知这世界要成什么样？”","“To be sure it is,” said the old man.“And little thanks you get for it, only impudence.He takes th’upper hand of me whenever he sees I’ve a sup taken.What’s the world coming to when sons speaks that way to their fathers?”"
"“他多大了？”奥康纳先生问道。","“What age is he?” said Mr. O’Connor."
"“十九。”老人说。","“Nineteen,” said the old man."
"“你为什么不让他做点儿事呢？”","“Why don’t you put him to something?”"
"“当然有过，自从他离开学校，我啥没替这个醉鬼做过？‘我不会供养你了，’我说，‘你必须得给自己谋个差事。’可是，说真的，他要找了工作情况会更糟；他会把那工作也喝没了的。”","“Sure, amn’t I never done at the drunken bowsy ever since he left school?‘I won’t keep you,’ I says.‘You must get a job for yourself.’ But, sure, it’s worse whenever he gets a job; he drinks it all.”"
"奥康纳先生同情地摇摇头，而那个老人则凝视着炉火陷入了沉默。有人打开房门喊道：","Mr. O’Connor shook his head in sympathy, and the old man fell silent, gazing into the fire.Someone opened the door of the room and called out:"
"“哈啰！这是共济会成员在开会吗？”","“Hello! Is this a Freemason’s meeting?”"
"“是谁呀？”那个老人问。","“Who’s that?” said the old man."
"""你们黑灯瞎火地在干什么？""一个声音问道。","“What are you doing in the dark?” asked a voice."
"“海因斯，是你吗？”奥康纳先生问。","“Is that you, Hynes?” asked Mr. O’Connor."
"“是我。你们黑灯瞎火地在干什么？”海恩斯先生一边说着一边走进了炉火的光亮之中。","“Yes.What are you doing in the dark?” said Mr. Hynes, advancing into the light of the fire."
"他是个高高瘦瘦的年轻人，留着一撮浅褐色的小胡子。一些小雨滴悬垂在他的帽檐边，他那夹克外套的领子朝上竖立着。","He was a tall, slender young man with a light brown moustache.Imminent little drops of rain hung at the brim of his hat and the collar of his jacket-coat was turned up."
"“哎，马特，”他冲着奥康纳先生说道，“情况怎么样了？”","“Well, Mat,” he said to Mr. O’Connor, “how goes it?”"
"奥康纳先生摇摇头。那个老人离开壁炉，在屋子里磕磕绊绊地找了一遍之后拿着两根蜡烛又回到了壁炉边，他把蜡烛一根接一根地伸进炉火里点着，然后拿到了桌子上。一间空荡荡的屋子显现出来，炉火也失去了所有欢乐的色彩。屋子的四壁几乎空无一物，只有一份选举演说词。屋子中间是一张小桌子，上面堆着一些文件。","Mr. O’Connor shook his head.The old man left the hearth and after stumbling about the room returned with two candlesticks which he thrust one after the other into the fire and carried to the table.A denuded room came into view and the fire lost all its cheerful colour.The walls of the room were bare except for a copy of an election address.In the middle of the room was a small table on which papers were heaped."
"海因斯先生斜靠在壁炉架上，问道：","Mr. Hynes leaned against the mantelpiece and asked:"
"“他付你钱了吗？”","“Has he paid you yet?”"
"“还没有。”奥康纳先生说，“我祈求上帝，今晚他可别丢下我们不管。”","“Not yet,” said Mr. O’Connor.“I hope to God he’ll not leave us in the lurch tonight.”"
"海因斯先生笑了。","Mr. Hynes laughed."
"“哦，他会付你钱的。别担心。”他说。","“O, he’ll pay you.Never fear,” he said."
"“我希望他要是真当回事的话就要显得爽快点儿。”奥康纳先生说。","“I hope he’ll look smart about it if he means business,” said Mr. O’Connor."
"“你怎么想，杰克？”海因斯先生讥讽地对那个老人说。","“What do you think, Jack?” said Mr. Hynes satirically to the old man."
"老人回到炉火边他的座位上，说道：","The old man returned to his seat by the fire, saying:"
"“不管咋说，不是他有却不给你。可不像另外那个吉卜赛人。”","“It isn’t but he has it, anyway.Not like the other tinker.”"
"“什么另外那个吉卜赛人？”海因斯先生问。","“What other tinker?” said Mr. Hynes."
"“科尔根呗。”那个老人轻蔑地说道。","“Colgan,” said the old man scornfully."
"“是因为科尔根是一个工人你才这样说吗？一个出色本分的泥瓦匠和一个酒店老板之间有什么区别吗——嗯？难道工人就不能和其他任何人一样拥有同等的权利加入到这个组织吗——唉，比起那些遇到个名字前面有头衔的人就把帽子摘下来拿在手里的先生们来说工匠难道不是更有权利吗？难道不是这样吗，马特？”海因斯先生对着奥康纳先生说道。","“It is because Colgan’s a working-man you say that?What’s the difference between a good honest bricklayer and a publican—eh?Hasn’t the working-man as good a right to be in the Corporation as anyone else—ay, and a better right than those shoneens that are always hat in hand before any fellow with a handle to his name? Isn’t that so, Mat?” said Mr. Hynes, addressing Mr. O’Connor."
"“我觉得你是对的。”奥康纳先生说。","“I think you’re right,” said Mr. O’Connor."
"“一个是普普通通的老实人，没有任何不规矩的行为。他参加进来是代表劳动阶级的。而你为之工作的那个人却只是想得到这样或那样的一份差事而已。”","“One man is a plain honest man with no hunker-sliding about him.He goes in to represent the labour classes.This fellow you’re working for only wants to get some job or other.”"
"“当然了，工人阶级应该要有人来代表的。”那个老人说。","“Of course, the working-classes should be represented,” said the old man."
"“那个工人，”海因斯先生说，“能得到极大乐趣，但却得不到半分钱。不过劳动创造了一切。那个工人并不是要给他的儿子们和侄子们还有那些同辈表亲们找什么肥差。那个工人也不会为了讨好一个有日耳曼血统的英国国王而把都柏林的荣誉拖进泥潭。”","“The working-man,” said Mr. Hynes, “gets all kicks and no halfpence.But it’s labour produces everything.The workingman is not looking for fat jobs for his sons and nephews and cousins.The working-man is not going to drag the honour of Dublin in the mud to please a German monarch.”"
"“怎么回事？”那个老人问道。","“How’s that?” said the old man."
"“你不知道吗？如果明年国王爱德华·雷克斯来这儿的话，他们想要向他敬呈一篇欢迎致辞。我们向一个外国国王行叩拜礼到底想要什么呢？”","“Don’t you know they want to present an address of welcome to Edward Rex if he comes here next year?What do we want kowtowing to a foreign king?”"
"“我们的人是不会投票赞成这篇致辞的。”奥康纳先生说，“他得靠民族党的选票才能通过。”","“Our man won’t vote for the address,” said Mr. O’Connor.“He goes in on the Nationalist ticket.”"
"“是吗？”海因斯先生问。“等着吧，你看他是不是。我了解他。他不是狡猾多变的迪基·蒂尔尼吗？”","“Won’t he?” said Mr. Hynes.“Wait till you see whether he will or not.I know him.Is it Tricky Dicky Tierney?”"
"“上帝作证！也许你是对的，乔。”奥康纳先生说。“无论如何，我希望他会带着钱现身。”","“By God!Perhaps you’re right, Joe,” said Mr. O’Connor.“Anyway, I wish he’d turn up with the spondulics.”"
"三个人都突然沉默了下来。那个老人开始把更多的煤灰撮在一起。海因斯先生摘下帽子，甩了甩，然后把外套的衣领放了下来，这样就露出了衣领上的一片常春藤叶子。","The three men fell silent.The old man began to rake more cinders together.Mr. Hynes took off his hat, shook it and then turned down the collar of his coat, displaying, as he did so, an ivy leaf in the lapel."
"“如果这个人还活着，”他一边说着，一边指了指那片叶子，“我们就不会谈什么欢迎致辞了。”","“If this man was alive,” he said, pointing to the leaf, “we’d have no talk of an address of welcome.”"
"“是这样的。”奥康纳先生说。","“That’s true,” said Mr. O’Connor."
"“啊，愿上帝与他们同在！”那个老人说。“那时候这叶子里还是有点生机的。”","“Musha, God be with them times!” said the old man，“There was some life in it then.”"
"房间又安静下来。接着一个双耳冻得通红的小个子男人急急火火、呼哧着鼻子推门而入。他急速走到炉火前，摩擦着双手，仿佛想要让它们擦出火花。","The room was silent again.Then a bustling little man with a snuffling nose and very cold ears pushed in the door.He walked over quickly to the fire, rubbing his hands as if he intended to produce a spark from them."
"“没钱喽，伙计们。”他说。","“No money, boys,” he said."
"“坐这儿，亨奇先生。”那个老人一边说着，一边把自己的椅子让给他。","“Sit down here, Mr. Henchy,” said the old man, offering him his chair."
"“喔，别动，杰克，别动。”亨奇先生说。","“O, don’t stir, Jack, don’t stir,” said Mr. Henchy"
"他草草地朝海因斯先生点了点头，然后在那个老人腾出来的椅子上坐了下来。","He nodded curtly to Mr. Hynes and sat down on the chair which the old man vacated."
"“你去奥吉尔街上发过了吗？”他问奥康纳先生。","“Did you serve Aungier Street?” he asked Mr. O’Connor."
"“是的。”奥康纳先生说着开始在口袋里寻找备忘录。","“Yes,” said Mr. O’Connor, beginning to search his pockets for memoranda."
"“你去拜访格兰姆斯了吗？”","“Did you call on Grimes?”"
"“我去了。”","“I did.”"
"“是吗？他站在哪边？”“他不愿意承诺。他说：‘我不会告诉任何人我会投哪一边的票。’不过我想他不会有问题。”","“Well?How does he stand?”“He wouldn’t promise.He said: ‘I won’t tell anyone what way I’m going to vote.’ But I think he’ll be all right.”"
"“为什么这样说？”","“Why so?”"
"“他问我提名的人都是谁；我告诉了他。我提到了伯克神父的名字。我想这不会有问题。”","“He asked me who the nominators were; and I told him.I mentioned Father Burke’s name.I think it’ll be all right.”"
"亨奇先生开始呼哧鼻子，以一种飞快的速度就着炉火摩擦起他的双手来。然后他说：","Mr. Henchy began to snuffle and to rub his hands over the fire at a terrific speed.Then he said:"
"“为了上帝的爱，杰克，给我们拿点儿炭过来吧。肯定还有剩下的。”那个老人走出了房间。","“For the love of God, Jack, bring us a bit of coal.There must be some left.”The old man went out of the room."
"“事没成。”亨奇先生说着摇了摇头。“我问了那个小鞋匠，可是他却说：‘哦，听着，亨奇先生，当我看见工作进展顺利的时候，我不会忘记你的，你可以放心的。’吝啬的小吉卜赛人！啊，他还能是别的什么样吗？”","“It’s no go,” said Mr. Henchy, shaking his head.“I asked the little shoeboy, but he said: ‘Oh, now, Mr. Henchy, when I see work going on properly I won’t forget you, you may be sure.’ Mean little tinker!’Usha, how could he be anything else?”"
"“我是怎么告你的，马特？”海因斯先生说，“狡猾的迪基·蒂尔尼。”","“What did I tell you, Mat?” said Mr. Hynes.“Tricky Dicky Tierney.”"
"“哦，他们让他多狡猾，他就有多狡猾。”亨奇先生说，“他长的那对小猪的眼睛可不是啥用没有。真该死！难道他就不能像个男子汉那样付钱，而不是说：‘哦，听着，亨奇先生，我必须得跟范宁先生谈谈……我已经花了不少钱了’？该下地狱的卑鄙小学童！我想他忘了他那小个子的老爸当年在玛丽巷开旧衣店的情形。”","“O, he’s as tricky as they make ‘em,” said Mr. Henchy.“He hasn’t got those little pigs’ eyes for nothing.Blast his soul!Couldn’t he pay up like a man instead of: ‘O, now, Mr. Henchy, I must speak to Mr. Fanning.... I’ve spent a lot of money’?Mean little schoolboy of hell!I suppose he forgets the time his little old father kept the hand-me-down shop in Mary’s Lane.”"
"“可那是事实吗？”奥康纳先生问道。","“But is that a fact?” asked Mr. O’Connor."
"“上帝，是的。”亨奇先生说，""你从来没听说过吗？男人们过去常常在星期天早上酒馆开门之前去那里买个马甲或买条裤子——还真像那么回事呢！可狡猾迪基的小个子老爸总是狡猾地在一个角落里放一个黑瓶子。现在你知道了吗？就是这样。那就是他初问世事的地方。”","“God, yes,” said Mr. Henchy.“Did you never hear that?And the men used to go in on Sunday morning before the houses were open to buy a waistcoat or a trousers—moya!But Tricky Dicky’s little old father always had a tricky little black bottle up in a corner.Do you mind now?That’s that.That’s where he first saw the light.”"
"那个老人拿着一些炭块回来了，他这儿一块那儿一块地把它们放到了火上。","The old man returned with a few lumps of coal which he placed here and there on the fire."
"“这事可难办了。”奥康纳先生说，“他要是不付钱，那他怎么能指望我们为他干活儿呢？”","“That’s a nice how-do-you-do,” said Mr. O’Connor.“How does he expect us to work for him if he won’t stump up?”"
"“我没办法。”亨奇先生说，“我料想在我回到家的时候肯定能在门厅里见到执法官们。”","“I can’t help it,” said Mr. Henchy.“I expect to find the bailiffs in the hall when I go home.”"
"海因斯先生笑了，他用肩膀挤出了人群，离开了壁炉架，准备告辞。","Mr. Hynes laughed and, shoving himself away from the mantelpiece with the aid of his shoulders, made ready to leave."
"“当国王爱迪来了的时候，一切就会好的。”他说，“好了伙计们，我暂且先走了。随后见。再见，再见。”","“It’ll be all right when King Eddie comes,” he said.“Well boys, I’m off for the present.See you later.’Bye, ’bye.”"
"他慢慢地走出了房间。亨奇先生和那个老人谁都没有说话，但是，在门就要关上的那一刻，一直情绪低沉地凝视着炉火的奥康纳先生突然喊道：","He went out of the room slowly.Neither Mr. Henchy nor the old man said anything, but, just as the door was closing, Mr. O’Connor, who had been staring moodily into the fire, called out suddenly:"
"“再见，乔。”","“Bye, Joe.”"
"亨奇先生等了一会儿之后才朝门的方向点了点头。","Mr. Henchy waited a few moments and then nodded in the direction of the door."
"“你说，”他隔着壁炉说道，“是什么把我们这位朋友带到这儿来的？他想要什么？”“啊，可怜的乔！”奥康纳先生一边说，一边把烟头扔到了火里，“他也缺钱，就像我们一样。”","“Tell me,” he said across the fire, “what brings our friend in here?What does he want?”“‘Usha, poor Joe!” said Mr. O’Connor, throwing the end of his cigarette into the fire, “he’s hard up, like the rest of us.”"
"亨奇先生使劲儿呼哧了一会儿鼻子，然后又吐了好大一口痰，差点儿没把火浇灭，炉火发出了嘶嘶的抗议声。","Mr. Henchy snuffled vigorously and spat so copiously that he nearly put out the fire, which uttered a hissing protest."
"“告诉你们我个人的坦诚之见，”他说，“我觉得他是从另一个阵营里来的人。他是科尔根的间谍，要让我说的话。到处去走走，尽量搞清楚他们进展如何。他们不会怀疑你的。明白了吗？”“唉，可怜的乔是一个正派人。”奥康纳先生说。","“To tell you my private and candid opinion,” he said, “I think he’s a man from the other camp.He’s a spy of Colgan’s, if you ask me. Just go round and try and find out how they’re getting on. They won’t suspect you.Do you twig?”“Ah, poor Joe is a decent skin,” said Mr. O’Connor."
"“他父亲曾是个受人尊敬的正派人。”亨奇先生承认，“可怜的老拉里·海因斯！他那时候可是做了不少的善事！不过我非常担心我们这位朋友的品质连19克拉都不到。真可恶，一个人缺钱我能理解，可是一个人靠欺骗来过活我是无法理解。难道他就不能有点男子汉的骨气吗？”","“His father was a decent, respectable man,” Mr. Henchy admitted.“Poor old Larry Hynes!Many a good turn he did in his day!But I’m greatly afraid our friend is not nineteen carat.Damn it, I can understand a fellow being hard up, but what I can’t understand is a fellow sponging.Couldn’t he have some spark of manhood about him?”"
"“他进来的时候没有受到我的热烈欢迎，”那个老人说，就让他替自己那边工作吧，但别来这儿瞎打听。”","“He doesn’t get a warm welcome from me when he comes,” said the old man. “Let him work for his own side and not come spying around here.”"
"“我不知道。”奥康纳先生一边狐疑地说着，一边掏出了卷烟纸和烟叶，“我觉得乔·海因斯是个直率的人。他也是个文笔聪秀之人。你还记得他写过的那篇东西吗……？”","“I don’t know,” said Mr. O’Connor dubiously, as he took out cigarette-papers and tobacco.“I think Joe Hynes is a straight man. He’s a clever chap, too, with the pen.Do you remember that thing he wrote...?”"
"“要我说，这些山坡勇士芬尼亚人中有一些可是有点过于聪明了。”亨奇先生说。“你们知道对这些小丑中的有些人，我个人的坦诚之见是什么吗？我认为他们中有一半人都在秘密地为城堡工作。”","“Some of these hillsiders and fenians are a bit too clever if ask me,” said Mr. Henchy.“Do you know what my private and candid opinion is about some of those little jokers?I believe half of them are in the pay of the Castle.”"
"“没法说。”那个老人说。","“There’s no knowing,” said the old man."
"“噢，可我知道这是事实。”亨奇先生说。“他们是城堡的雇用文人……我不是说海因斯……不，该死的，我觉得他还不至于那样……不过有一个小个子贵族，长着斗鸡眼——你们知道我指的这个爱国者是谁吧？”","“O, but I know it for a fact,” said Mr. Henchy.“They‘re Castle hacks.... I don’t say Hynes.... No, damn it, I think he’s a stroke above that.... But there’s a certain little nobleman with a cock-eye—you know the patriot I’m alluding to?”"
"奥康纳先生点了点头。","Mr. O’Connor nodded."
"“如果你愿意，还有瑟尔上校的一个嫡系后代呢！啊，一个爱国者的心血！这个人现在会为了四便士而卖国——啊——然后屈膝下跪，感谢万能的基督他还有一个国家可以出卖。”","“There’s a lineal descendant of Major Sirr for you if you like!O, the heart’s blood of a patriot!That’s a fellow now that’d sell his country for fourpence—ay—and go down on his bended knees and thank the Almighty Christ he had a country to sell.”"
"有敲门声传来。","There was a knock at the door."
"“进来！”亨奇先生说。","“Come in!” said Mr. Henchy."
"一个好似穷神父或穷演员的人出现在门口。他黑衣紧扣，裹在短小的身体上，说不出他戴的是神父领结还是俗人领结，因为他那件破旧长礼服的领子竖起来裹住了他的脖子，礼服的纽扣没有包起来，反射着烛光。他戴着一顶硬质的黑色圆毡帽。他的脸上有一些亮闪闪的雨滴，看上去好像黄色的湿奶酪，只有在颧骨那个地方露出了玫红色的两小块。他突然张开了他的大嘴表示失望，同时又睁大了他那双非常明亮的蓝眼睛表示着喜悦和惊奇。","A person resembling a poor clergyman or a poor actor appeared in the doorway.His black clothes were tightly buttoned on his short body and it was impossible to say whether he wore a clergyman’s collar or a layman’s, because the collar of his shabby frock-coat, the uncovered buttons of which reflected the candlelight, was turned up about his neck.He wore a round hat of hard black felt.His face, shining with raindrops, had the appearance of damp yellow cheese save where two rosy spots indicated the cheekbones.He opened his very long mouth suddenly to express disappointment and at the same time opened wide his very bright blue eyes to express pleasure and surprise."
"“啊，基翁神父！”亨奇先生一边说，一边从椅子上跳了起来，“是你吗？进来！”","“O Father Keon!” said Mr. Henchy, jumping up from his chair.“Is that you?Come in!”"
"“哦，不，不，不！”基翁神父很快说道，他撅着嘴唇，仿佛是在跟一个孩子说话。","“O, no, no, no!” said Father Keon quickly, pursing his lips as if he were addressing a child."
"“你不想进来坐下吗？”","“Won’t you come in and sit down?”"
"“不，不，不！”基翁神父说，声音里透着审慎、宽容和柔和，“这会儿就别让我打搅你们了！我只是在找范宁先生……”","“No, no, no!” said Father Keon, speaking in a discreet, indulgent, velvety voice.“Don’t let me disturb you now!I’m just looking for Mr. Fanning....”"
"“他大概在黑鹰酒馆吧，”亨奇先生说。“可你不想进来坐会儿吗？”","“He’s round at the Black Eagle,” said Mr. Henchy.“But won’t you come in and sit down a minute?”"
"“不了，不了，谢谢你。只是点小事。”基翁神父说，“真的谢谢你。”","“No, no, thank you.It was just a little business matter,” said Father Keon.“Thank you, indeed.”"
"他从门口退了出去，亨奇先生抓起一根蜡烛，走到门口点着亮送他下楼。","He retreated from the doorway and Mr. Henchy, seizing one of the candlesticks, went to the door to light him downstairs."
"“哦，不麻烦了，请回吧！”","“O, don’t trouble, I beg!”"
"“不麻烦的，楼梯太暗了。”","“No, but the stairs is so dark.”"
"“不，不，我能看见……谢谢你了，真的。”","“No, no, I can see.... Thank you, indeed.”"
"“现在可以了吗？”","“Are you right now?”"
"“可以了，谢谢……谢谢。”","“All right, thanks.... Thanks.”"
"亨奇先生举着蜡烛返回去，把蜡烛放到了桌子上。他重又在炉火旁坐了下来。沉默了好一会儿。","Mr. Henchy returned with the candlestick and put it on the table.He sat down again at the fire.There was silence for a few moments."
"“告诉我，约翰。”奥康纳先生一边说，一边用另一块硬纸片点着了烟。","“Tell me, John,” said Mr. O’Connor, lighting his cigarette with another pasteboard card."
"“嗯？”","“Hm?”"
"“他到底是干什么的？”","“What he is exactly?”"
"“问我个简单点的问题。”亨奇先生说。","“Ask me an easier one,” said Mr. Henchy."
"“范宁和他在我看来似乎非常亲近。他们常常一起呆在卡瓦纳的店里。他真是个神父吗？”","“Fanning and himself seem to me very thick.They’re often in Kavanagh’s together.Is he a priest at all?”"
"“嗯，是吧，我想是这样吧……我觉得他就是你说的那种败家子。我们当中这样的人不多，感谢上帝！不过我们还是有几个……他是一个运气不太好的人……”","“Mmm, yes, I believe so.... I think he’s what you call black sheep.We haven’t many of them, thank God!but we have a few.... He’s an unfortunate man of some kind....”"
"“那他是怎么过活的呢？”奥康纳先生问。","“And how does he knock it out?” asked Mr. O’Connor."
"“这又是一个谜。”","“That’s another mystery.”"
"“他附属于某个小教堂或教会或者机构或者——”","“Is he attached to any chapel or church or institution or—-”"
"“不，”亨奇先生说，“我想他是为了自己的利益而游走四方……上帝宽恕我，”他补充说，“我曾以为他是很贪喝黑啤酒的。”","“No,” said Mr. Henchy, “I think he’s travelling on his own account.... God forgive me,” he added, “I thought he was the dozen of stout.”"
"“能弄到点喝的吗？”奥康纳先生问。","“Is there any chance of a drink itself?” asked Mr. O’Connor."
"“我也渴了。”那个老人说。","“I’m dry too,” said the old man."
"“我问过那个小鞋匠三次，”亨奇先生说，“问他是否能送上来一打黑啤酒。我刚刚又问了他一次，可他只穿着衬衫斜靠在柜台上，和高级市政官考利聊得正起劲。”","“I asked that little shoeboy three times,” said Mr. Henchy, “would he send up a dozen of stout.I asked him again now, but he was leaning on the counter in his shirt-sleeves having a deep goster with Alderman Cowley.”"
"“为什么你不提醒他呢？”奥康纳先生说。","“Why didn’t you remind him?” said Mr. O’Connor."
"“唉，他正和高级市政官考利说话，我不能过去。我就那么等着，直到我跟他的目光相遇，然后才说：‘我刚才跟你说的那件小事……’‘没问题，H.先生。’他说。没错啦，肯定这小拇哥已经把这事全忘了。”","“Well, I couldn’t go over while he was talking to Alderman Cowley.I just waited till I caught his eye, and said: ‘About that little matter I was speaking to you about....’ ‘That’ll be all right, Mr. H.,’ he said.Yerra, sure the little hop-o’-my-thumb has forgotten all about it.”"
"“他们正在进行某种交易。”奥康纳先生若有所思地说道，“昨天在萨福克街拐角处我看见他们三个人在起劲地忙着什么。”","“There’s some deal on in that quarter,” said Mr. O’Connor thoughtfully.“I saw the three of them hard at it yesterday at Suffolk Street corner.”"
"“我想我知道他们在搞什么小把戏。”亨奇先生说，“如今你必须得给城市元老们塞些钱，要是你想当选市长的话。然后他们就可以让你当上市长。上帝作证！我要认真考虑考虑，让自己成为一名城市元老。你们觉得怎么样？我会适合这份工作吗？”","“I think I know the little game they’re at,” said Mr. Henchy.“You must owe the City Fathers money nowadays if you want to be made Lord Mayor.Then they’ll make you Lord Mayor.By God!I’m thinking seriously of becoming a City Father myself.What do you think?Would I do for the job?”"
"奥康纳先生放声大笑。","Mr. O’Connor laughed."
"“那是就塞钱而言……”","“So far as owing money goes....”"
"“开车驶出市长官邸，”亨奇先生说，“身边簇拥着保镖，杰克头戴涂了粉的假发站在我身后——呃？”","“Driving out of the Mansion House,” said Mr. Henchy, “in all my vermin, with Jack here standing up behind me in a powdered wig—eh?”"
"“让我当你的私人秘书，约翰。”","“And make me your private secretary, John.”"
"“好。我还会让基翁神父做我的私人神父。我们会成立个同人党。”","“Yes.And I’ll make Father Keon my private chaplain.We’ll have a family party.”"
"“的确如此，亨奇先生。”那个老人说，“和他们有些人相比你会保持更好的作派。有一天我跟老基根，那个门房，说话。‘你喜欢你的新主人吗，帕特？’我问他说。‘现在你没什么乐趣了吧。’我说。‘乐趣！’他说，‘他快靠油布的味道过活了！’你们知道他告诉我什么了吗？现在，我向上帝宣誓当时我并没有相信他的话。”","“Faith, Mr. Henchy,” said the old man, “you’d keep up better style than some of them.I was talking one day to old Keegan, the porter.‘And how do you like your new master, Pat?’ says I to him.‘You haven’t much entertaining now,’ says I.‘Entertaining!’ says he.‘He’d live on the smell of an oil-rag.’ And do you know what he told me?Now, I declare to God I didn’t believe him.”"
"“是什么？”亨奇先生和奥康纳先生说。","“What?” said Mr. Henchy and Mr. O’Connor."
"“他告诉我：‘你对都柏林市长派人去买一磅排骨用来做晚餐这事怎么看？这样的高级生活怎么样？’他说。‘哎呀！哎呀，’我说。‘一磅排骨，’他说，‘送进市长官邸。’‘哎呀！’我说，‘现在到底是哪种人在位呢？”","“He told me: ‘What do you think of a Lord Mayor of Dublin sending out for a pound of chops for his dinner?How’s that for high living?’ says he.‘Wisha! wisha,’ says I.‘A pound of chops,’ says he, ‘coming into the Mansion House.’ ‘Wisha!’ says I, ’what kind of people is going at all now?”"
"在这个当口，传来一下敲门声，一个男孩伸进头来。","At this point there was a knock at the door, and a boy put in his head."
"“什么事？”那个老人说。","“What is it?” said the old man."
"“从黑鹰酒馆来的，”男孩一边说，一边侧身走了进来，把一个篮子放在地板上，篮子里响起了瓶子碰撞的声音。","“From the Black Eagle,” said the boy, walking in sideways and depositing a basket on the floor with a noise of shaken bottles."
"那个老人帮着男孩把瓶子从篮子里拿到桌子上，然后清点了一下总数。倒腾完之后，男孩把篮子挎到一个胳膊上，问道：","The old man helped the boy to transfer the bottles from the basket to the table and counted the full tally.After the transfer the boy put his basket on his arm and asked:"
"“有瓶子吗？”","“Any bottles?”"
"“什么瓶子？”那个老人说。","“What bottles?” said the old man."
"“难道你不让我们先把它们喝掉吗？”亨奇先生说。","“Won’t you let us drink them first?” said Mr. Henchy."
"“我是按吩咐要瓶子的。”","“I was told to ask for the bottles.”"
"“那明天再来吧。”那个老人说。","“Come back tomorrow,” said the old man."
"“听着，小伙子！”亨奇先生说，“你愿意跑去奥费拉尔的酒馆让他借给我们一个开瓶器吗——就说是借给亨奇先生的。告诉他我们用完就还，一刻都不留。把篮子先放那儿。”","“Here, boy!” said Mr. Henchy, “will you run over to O’Farrell’s and ask him to lend us a corkscrew—for Mr. Henchy, say.Tell him we won’t keep it a minute.Leave the basket there.”"
"男孩出去了，亨奇先生开始高兴地搓着双手，说道：","The boy went out and Mr. Henchy began to rub his hands cheerfully, saying:"
"“啊，不错，他毕竟还没有那么坏。他还说话算话，不管怎样。”","“Ah, well, he’s not so bad after all.He’s as good as his word, anyhow.”"
"“没有酒杯。”那个老人说。","“There’s no tumblers,” said the old man."
"“哦，别烦心这事了，杰克。”亨奇先生说，“过去许多好汉都是直接拿瓶子喝酒的。”","“O, don’t let that trouble you, Jack,” said Mr. Henchy.“Many’s the good man before now drank out of the bottle.”"
"“不管怎么说，总比没有好多了。”奥康纳先生说。","“Anyway, it’s better than nothing,” said Mr. O’Connor."
"“他不是个坏人，”亨奇先生说，“只是范宁从他那儿借了那么多钱。他本意很好，你们要知道，是以他自己那种拙劣的方式。”","“He’s not a bad sort,” said Mr. Henchy, “only Fanning has such a loan of him. He means well, you know, in his own tinpot way.”"
"男孩拿着开瓶器回来了。老人打开了这些瓶子，正要把开瓶器还回去，亨奇先生忽然对男孩说：","The boy came back with the corkscrew.The old man opened three bottles and was handing back the corkscrew when Mr. Henchy said to the boy:"
"“你想喝一瓶吗，小伙子？”","“Would you like a drink, boy?”"
"“只要您高兴就行，先生。”男孩说。","“If you please, sir,” said the boy."
"那个老人不情愿地打开了另一瓶，然后把它递给了那个男孩。","The old man opened another bottle grudgingly, and handed it to the boy."
"“你多大了？”他问。","“What age are you?” he asked."
"“十七。”男孩说。","“Seventeen,” said the boy."
"那个老人没再说什么，男孩拿起瓶子说：“请接受我最高的敬意，先生，给亨奇先生。”他喝了瓶里的酒，把瓶子放回到桌子上，用袖子擦了嘴。然后他拿起开瓶器，侧身从房门走了出去，嘴里嘟囔着某种致意的话。","As the old man said nothing further, the boy took the bottle and said: “Here’s my best respects, sir, to Mr. Henchy,” drank the contents, put the bottle back on the table and wiped his mouth with his sleeve.Then he took up the corkscrew and went out of the door sideways, muttering some form of salutation."
"“事情就是这样开始的。”那个老人说。","“That’s the way it begins,” said the old man."
"“以小见大的开端。”亨奇先生说。","“The thin edge of the wedge,” said Mr. Henchy."
"那个老人分发了他已经打开的那三瓶酒，几个人都同时对着瓶子喝了起来。喝完之后，每个人都把自己的酒瓶放到手能够到的壁炉架上，然后满意地长吸了一口气。","The old man distributed the three bottles which he had opened and the men drank from them simultaneously.After having drank each placed his bottle on the mantelpiece within hand’s reach and drew in a long breath of satisfaction."
"“好啊，今天这一天我干得不错。”亨奇先生在停顿了一会儿之后说道。","“Well, I did a good day’s work today,” said Mr. Henchy, after a pause."
"“是吗，约翰？”","“That so, John?”"
"“是的。我替他在道森街上搞定了一两件事，克罗夫顿和我。就我们自己私下说说，你们知道吧，克罗夫顿（他是个正直的家伙，当然了），可他当拉选票的人一点都不够格。他跟一条狗都没话说。他站在那儿，看着那些人，只让我一个人说。”","“Yes.I got him one or two sure things in Dawson Street, Crofton and myself.Between ourselves, you know, Crofton (he’s a decent chap, of course), but he’s not worth a damn as a canvasser.He hasn’t a word to throw to a dog.He stands and looks at the people while I do the talking.”"
"这时，两个男人走进了房间。其中一个是个很胖的男人，他那蓝色哔叽布衣服似乎随时都有从他那臌胀的身体上掉落下来的危险。他长着一张大脸，神情酷似一头小牛的脸，瞪着蓝色的眼睛，留着一撮花白的小胡子。另一个人要年轻许多，也瘦弱得多，长着一张瘦削的脸，胡须刮得干干净净。他身穿一件双层领子的高领外衣，头戴一顶阔边圆顶高帽。","Here two men entered the room.One of them was a very fat man whose blue serge clothes seemed to be in danger of falling from his sloping figure.He had a big face which resembled a young ox’s face in expression, staring blue eyes and a grizzled moustache.The other man, who was much younger and frailer, had a thin, clean-shaven face.He wore a very high double collar and a wide-brimmed bowler hat."
"“哈啰，克罗夫顿！”亨奇先生冲那个胖男人说，“说魔鬼……”","“Hello, Crofton!” said Mr. Henchy to the fat man.“Talk of the devil...”"
"“这些喝的从哪儿来的？”那个年轻人问，“奶牛生崽了？”","“Where did the boose come from?” asked the young man.“Did the cow calve?”"
"“哦，当然了，莱昂斯先注意到的总是喝的东西！”奥康纳先生笑着说道。","“O, of course, Lyons spots the drink first thing!” said Mr. O’Connor, laughing."
"“这就是你们这些家伙拉选票的方式？”莱昂斯先生说，“克罗夫顿和我可是在外面挨冻淋雨地搜集选票呢。”","“Is that the way you chaps canvass,” said Mr. Lyons, “and Crofton and I out in the cold and rain looking for votes?”"
"“呸，你这个讨厌鬼，”亨奇先生说，“我五分钟内拉来的选票都要比你们俩一个星期拉来的都要多。”","“Why, blast your soul,” said Mr. Henchy, “I’d get more votes in five minutes than you two’d get in a week.”"
"“再开两瓶黑啤酒，杰克。”奥康纳先生说。","“Open two bottles of stout, Jack,” said Mr. O’Connor."
"“我怎么开啊？”那个老人说，“没有开瓶器啊。”","“How can I?” said the old man, “when there’s no corkscrew?”"
"“等会儿，等会儿！”亨奇先生说着迅速站起身来，“你们见过这个小把戏吗？”","“Wait now, wait now!” said Mr. Henchy, getting up quickly.“Did you ever see this little trick?”"
"他从桌子上抓起两个瓶子，把它们拿到炉火边，放到了壁炉搁架上。然后他又在炉火边坐了下来，从自己的瓶子里喝了一口酒。莱昂斯先生坐在桌子边上，帽子推到后脖颈处，开始摇摆起双腿来。","He took two bottles from the table and, carrying them to the fire, put them on the hob.Then he sat down again by the fire and took another drink from his bottle.Mr. Lyons sat on the edge of the table, pushed his hat towards the nape of his neck and began to swing his legs."
"“哪瓶酒是我的？”他问。","“Which is my bottle?” he asked."
"“是这瓶，年轻人。”亨奇先生说。","“This, lad,” said Mr. Henchy."
"克罗夫顿在一个箱子上坐下，专注地看着壁炉搁架上另外那瓶酒。他沉默不语有两个原因。第一个原因本身就很充分，那就是他没有什么可说的；第二个原因是他认为他的同伴都在他之下。他曾经是保守党人威尔金斯的选票游说人，但是在保守党取消自己的人选，两害相较取其轻转而支持民族党候选人之后，他就受雇为蒂尔尼先生工作了。","Mr. Crofton sat down on a box and looked fixedly at the other bottle on the hob. He was silent for two reasons.The first reason, sufficient in itself, was that he had nothing to say; the second reason was that he considered his companions beneath him. He had been a canvasser for Wilkins, the Conservative, but when the Conservatives had withdrawn their man and, choosing the lesser of two evils, given their support to the Nationalist candidate, he had been engaged to work for Mr. Tierney."
"几分钟之后，随着满带歉意的“砰”的一声，那个木塞从莱昂斯先生那个酒瓶上飞了出去。莱昂斯先生从桌子上跳了下来，走到炉火边，取出他那瓶酒，拿着它回到了桌子边。","In a few minutes an apologetic “Pok!” was heard as the cork flew out of Mr. Lyons’ bottle.Mr. Lyons jumped off the table, went to the fire, took his bottle and carried it back to the table."
"“我刚刚还跟他们在讲，克罗夫顿，”亨奇先生说，“我们今天拉到了不少选票。”","“I was just telling them, Crofton,” said Mr. Henchy, “that we got a good few votes today.”"
"“你们争取到了些什么人？”莱昂斯先生问。","“Who did you get?” asked Mr. Lyons."
"“呃呣，我争取到帕克斯算一个，我还争取到阿特金森算两个，还争取到了道森街的沃德。他还是个很好的老头儿——标准的老花花公子，老保守党人！‘可是你的候选人不是个民族党人吗？’他说。‘他是个正派人。’我说。‘他赞成任何对这个国家有益的事情。他是个纳税大户。’我说，‘他在城里有大块的房产，三处产业，降低税率难道不是对他很有利吗？他是一个成就卓著、受人尊敬的市民，’我说，‘一个济贫法维护者，他不属于任何党派，不管是好党，坏党，还是中立党。’这就是和他们说话的方式。”","“Well, I got Parkes for one, and I got Atkinson for two, and got Ward of Dawson Street.Fine old chap he is, too—regular old toff, old Conservative!‘But isn’t your candidate a Nationalist?’ said he.‘He’s a respectable man,’ said I.‘He’s in favour of whatever will benefit this country.He’s a big ratepayer,’ I said.‘He has extensive house property in the city and three places of business and isn’t it to his own advantage to keep down the rates?He’s a prominent and respected citizen,’ said I, ‘and a Poor Law Guardian, and he doesn’t belong to any party, good, bad, or indifferent.’ That’s the way to talk to ’em.”"
"“给国王的致辞怎么样了？”莱昂斯先生喝了酒砸吧着嘴巴说道。","“And what about the address to the King?” said Mr. Lyons, after drinking and smacking his lips."
"“听我说。”亨奇先生说，“这个国家需要的，正如我跟老沃德说的那样，是资金。国王来这里意味着大量的钱将涌入这个国家。都柏林的市民们将由此获益。看看那边那些码头沿岸的所有工厂，闲置着呢！看看这个国家要有的钱吧，只要我们能让旧工业、制造厂、造船厂和那些工厂都运转起来。我们需要的就是资金。”","“Listen to me,” said Mr. Henchy.“What we want in this country, as I said to old Ward, is capital.The King’s coming here will mean an influx of money into this country.The citizens of Dublin will benefit by it. Look at all the factories down by the quays there, idle!Look at all the money there is in the country if we only worked the old industries, the mills, the ship-building yards and factories.It’s capital we want.”"
"“不过听着，约翰。”奥康纳先生说，“我们为什么要欢迎英格兰国王呢？难道帕内尔本人不是……”","“But look here, John,” said Mr. O’Connor.“Why should we welcome the King of England?Didn’t Parnell himself...”"
"“帕内尔，”亨奇先生说，“是死了。听着，我是这样看这件事的。这家伙继位的时候头发都白了，他老母亲很多年来一直不让他靠近王位。他是个世界公民，他对我们的用心是好的。他是个非常正派的大好人，要我说的话，关于他没有什么该死的胡言乱语。他只是对自己说：‘那个老人家从来都没去看过这些野蛮的爱尔兰人。基督作证，我会亲自去看看他们是什么样。’我们会去侮辱这样一个要来这儿进行友好访问的人吗？嗯？这样想不对吗，克罗夫顿？”","“Parnell,” said Mr. Henchy, “is dead.Now, here’s the way I look at it.Here’s this chap come to the throne after his old mother keeping him out of it till the man was grey.He’s a man of the world, and he means well by us. He’s a jolly fine decent fellow, if you ask me, and no damn nonsense about him.He just says to himself: ‘The old one never went to see these wild Irish.By Christ, I’ll go myself and see what they’re like.’ And are we going to insult the man when he comes over here on a friendly visit?Eh? Isn’t that right, Crofton?”"
"克罗夫顿先生点了点头。","Mr. Crofton nodded his head."
"“不过毕竟现在，”莱昂斯先生争辩地说道，“爱德华国王的生活，你要知道，并非最……”","“But after all now,” said Mr. Lyons argumentatively, “King Edward’s life, you know, is not the very...”"
"“过去的就让它过去吧。”亨奇先生说。“我个人是钦佩这个人的。他只是个普通的滑稽演员，就像你和我。他喜欢喝烈性酒，他或许也算是个浪荡子，他还是个不错的运动员。该死的，难道我们爱尔兰人就不能进行公平游戏吗？”","“Let bygones be bygones,” said Mr. Henchy.“I admire the man personally.He’s just an ordinary knockabout like you and me. He’s fond of his glass of grog and he’s a bit of a rake, perhaps, and he’s a good sportsman.Damn it, can’t we Irish play fair?”"
"“这些说得都很好。”莱昂斯先生说，“不过看看帕内尔现在的情形吧。”","“That’s all very fine,” said Mr. Lyons.“But look at the case of Parnell now.”"
"“以上帝的名义，”亨奇先生说，“这两件事的可比性在哪里？”","“In the name of God,” said Mr. Henchy, “where’s the analogy between the two cases?”"
"“我的意思是，”莱昂斯先生说，“我们有自己的理想。所以，为什么我们要欢迎这样一个人呢？你们觉得帕内尔做了那些事之后他还适合领导我们吗？还有，为什么我们要为爱德华七世来做这事呢？”","“What I mean,” said Mr. Lyons, “is we have our ideals.Why, now, would we welcome a man like that?Do you think now after what he did Parnell was a fit man to lead us?And why, then, would we do it for Edward the Seventh?”"
"“今天是帕内尔的周年纪念日，”奥康纳先生说，“别让大家涌起什么不良的情绪。我们都尊重他吧，既然他已经死了，去了——甚至连保守党也没了。”他转向克罗夫顿先生补充道。","“This is Parnell’s anniversary,” said Mr. O’Connor, “and don’t let us stir up any bad blood.We all respect him now that he’s dead and gone—even the Conservatives,” he added, turning to Mr. Crofton."
"砰！那个反应迟缓的瓶塞从克罗夫顿先生那个酒瓶上飞了出去。克罗夫顿先生从他坐的箱子上站起来，走到了炉火边。在拿着他的战利品返回去的时候，他用低沉的嗓音说道：","Pok!The tardy cork flew out of Mr. Crofton’s bottle.Mr. Crofton got up from his box and went to the fire.As he returned with his capture he said in a deep voice:"
"“议会里我们这一边都尊重他，因为他曾是个绅士。”","“Our side of the house respects him, because he was a gentleman.”"
"“你可说对了，克罗夫顿！”亨奇先生激切地说道，“他是唯一能让那帮乌合之众保持秩序的人。‘坐下，你们这帮狗东西！躺下，你们这帮杂种狗！’这就是他对待他们的方式。进来，乔！进来！”他瞥见海因斯先生出现在门口便大声喊道。","“Right you are, Crofton!” said Mr. Henchy fiercely.“He was the only man that could keep that bag of cats in order.‘Down, ye dogs!Lie down, ye curs!’ That’s the way he treated them.Come in, Joe!Come in!” he called out, catching sight of Mr. Hynes in the doorway."
"海因斯先生慢慢地走了进来。","Mr. Hynes came in slowly."
"“再开一瓶黑啤酒，杰克。”亨奇先生说，“哦，我忘了这儿没有开瓶器！这儿，给我拿一瓶到这儿来，我把它放在火上。”","“Open another bottle of stout, Jack,” said Mr. Henchy.“O, I forgot there’s no corkscrew!Here, show me one here and I’ll put it at the fire.”"
"那个老人递给他另一瓶酒，他把它放到了搁架上。","The old man handed him another bottle and he placed it on the hob."
"“坐下，乔。”奥康纳先生说，“我们刚刚正在谈论咱们的领袖。”","“Sit down, Joe,” said Mr. O‘Connor, “we’re just talking about the Chief.”"
"“哎，哎！”亨奇先生说。","“Ay, ay!” said Mr. Henchy."
"海因斯先生挨着莱昂斯先生坐在了桌子旁边，但什么都没说。","Mr. Hynes sat on the side of the table near Mr. Lyons but said nothing."
"“他们中有一个人，无论如何，”亨奇先生说，“是不曾背弃他的。上帝作证，我会替你说话，乔！不，上帝作证，你忠心于他，真像个男子汉！”","“There’s one of them, anyhow,” said Mr. Henchy, “that didn’t renege him.By God, I’ll say for you, Joe!No, by God, you stuck to him like a man!”"
"“哦，乔，”奥康纳先生突然说道，""给我们念念你写的那个东西——你还记得吧？你随身带着它吗？”","“O, Joe,” said Mr. O’Connor suddenly.“Give us that thing you wrote—do you remember?Have you got it on you?”"
"“哦，对啊！”亨奇先生说，""给我们念念那个。你以前听过吗，克罗夫顿？现在听听这个：真是杰作。”","“O, ay!” said Mr. Henchy.“Give us that.Did you ever hear that, Crofton? Listen to this now: splendid thing.”"
"“开始吧，”奥康纳先生说，“请说吧，乔。”","“Go on,” said Mr. O’Connor.“Fire away, Joe.”"
"海因斯先生似乎没有马上想起来他们提到的那篇东西，不过，想了一会儿之后，他说：","Mr. Hynes did not seem to remember at once the piece to which they were alluding, but, after reflecting a while, he said:"
"“哦，那个东西是……当然了，它现在过时了。”","“O, that thing is it.... Sure, that’s old now.”"
"“直接说吧，老兄！”奥康纳先生说。","“Out with it, man!” said Mr. O’Connor."
"“嘘，嘘。”亨奇先生说，“好了，乔！”","“’Sh, ’sh,” said Mr. Henchy.“Now, Joe!”"
"海因斯先生又犹豫了好一会儿。然后在沉默之中，他脱下帽子，把它放到桌子上，站了起来。他似乎是在脑子里默念那篇东西。在相当长的一段停顿之后，他大声朗诵道：","Mr. Hynes hesitated a little longer.Then amid the silence he took off his hat, laid it on the table and stood up. He seemed to be rehearsing the piece in his mind.After a rather long pause he announced:"
"帕内尔之死1891年10月6日","THE DEATH OF PARNELL 6th October, 1891"
"他清了一两次喉咙，然后开始朗诵：","He cleared his throat once or twice and then began to recite:"
"他死了。我们的无冕之王死了。哦，伊阿琳，怀着悲哀悼念吧，因为他倒下死了，是那帮残暴的现代伪君子将他击倒杀害。他倒下了，为那些懦弱的卑鄙小人所害。他从泥沼升至光荣；而伊阿琳的希望和伊阿琳的梦想在焚烧着其君主的柴堆上灭亡。在宫殿，茅舍或是在棚屋，爱尔兰的心脏，无论它在何方，都因悲伤而沉重——因为他去了，他本可以铸就她的命运。他本来会让他的伊阿琳名闻遐迩，让那面绿色的旗帜光荣地飘扬，让她的政治家们、诗人们和战士们挺立于世界各国的面前。他曾梦想过（啊，那只是个梦想！）自由：可当他竭力去抓住这个幻象时，背叛却拆散了他和他的所爱。真是可耻，那些懦弱卑鄙的手，他们击倒了自己的领主，或是用一个亲吻把他出卖给那群谄媚的神父——没有一个是他的朋友。愿无尽的耻辱充斥着那些人的记忆，他们曾极力玷污和诽谤一个高尚的名字，他曾傲然藐视过他们。他倒下了，正如那些伟人倒下一样，高贵地不屈不折直到最后一刻，现在死亡已使他同伊阿琳过去的英雄们团聚。不会再有争斗的声音搅扰他的睡眠！平静地，他安息着：现在没有人类的痛苦或者高远的抱负会再激励他去到达光荣的顶峰。他们得逞了：他们击倒了他。但是伊阿琳，听着，他的精神可会升起，仿佛浴火重生的凤凰，当那一天的黎明破晓，那一天我们将由自由统治。在那一天愿伊阿琳为欢乐举起的酒杯里能有一丝悲痛——纪念帕内尔。","He is dead.Our Uncrowned King is dead.O, Erin, mourn with grief and woe For he lies dead whom the fell gang Of modern hypocrites laid low. He lies slain by the coward hounds He raised to glory from the mire; And Erin’s hopes and Erin’s dreams Perish upon her monarch’s pyre.In palace, cabin or in cot The Irish heart where’er it be Is bowed with woe—for he is gone Who would have wrought her destiny.He would have had his Erin famed, The green flag gloriously unfurled, Her statesmen, bards and warriors raised Before the nations of the World.He dreamed (alas, ’twas but a dream!)Of Liberty: but as he strove To clutch that idol, treachery Sundered him from the thing he loved.Shame on the coward, caitiff hands That smote their Lord or with a kiss Betrayed him to the rabble-rout Of fawning priests—no friends of his.May everlasting shame consume The memory of those who tried To befoul and smear the exalted name Of one who spurned them in his pride.He fell as fall the mighty ones, Nobly undaunted to the last, And death has now united him With Erin’s heroes of the past.No sound of strife disturb his sleep!Calmly he rests: no human pain Or high ambition spurs him now The peaks of glory to attain.They had their way: they laid him low. But Erin, list, his spirit may Rise, like the Phoenix from the flames, When breaks the dawning of the day, The day that brings us Freedom’s reign.And on that day may Erin well Pledge in the cup she lifts to Joy One grief—the memory of Parnell."
"海因斯先生又在桌子上坐了下来。他完成朗诵的时候，先是一片静默，然后爆发出了一阵掌声：连莱昂斯先生也鼓了掌。掌声持续了一会儿。最后停下来的时候，所有的听众都默默地从各自的酒瓶里喝了口酒。","Mr. Hynes sat down again on the table.When he had finished his recitation there was a silence and then a burst of clapping: even Mr. Lyons clapped.The applause continued for a little time.When it had ceased all the auditors drank from their bottles in silence."
"砰！瓶塞从海因斯先生的瓶子上飞了出去，但是海因斯先生却依然红着脸、光着头在桌子上坐着。他似乎并未听到这声邀请。","Pok!The cork flew out of Mr. Hynes’ bottle, but Mr. Hynes remained sitting flushed and bare-headed on the table.He did not seem to have heard the invitation."
"“好人啊，乔！”奥康纳先生一边说着，一边掏出了他的卷烟纸和烟袋，以掩饰自己的情感。","“Good man, Joe!” said Mr. O’Connor, taking out his cigarette papers and pouch the better to hide his emotion."
"“你觉得怎么样，克罗夫顿？”亨奇先生叫喊道，“难道不好吗？什么？”","“What do you think of that, Crofton?” cried Mr. Henchy.“Isn’t that fine?What?”"
"克罗夫顿说这是一篇非常出色的作品。","Crofton said that it was a very fine piece of writing."
"第十三章  一位母亲","CHAPTER 13 A MOTHER"
"霍洛汉先生是爱尔兰文艺协会的助理秘书，近一个月以来，他一直在都柏林四处奔走，手里和口袋里全是脏兮兮的纸片，安排着系列音乐会的事情。他的一条腿有残疾，为此朋友们都叫他跳跳霍洛汉。他不停地走来走去，一个小时一个小时地站在街角与人交涉，然后整理笔记；但最终却是由卡尼太太来安排一切。","MR HOLOHAN, assistant secretary of the Eire Abu Society, had been walking up and down Dublin for nearly a month, with his hands and pockets full of dirty pieces of paper, arranging about the series of concerts.He had a game leg and for this his friends called him Hoppy Holohan.He walked up and down constantly, stood by the hour at street corners arguing the point and made notes; but in the end it was Mrs. Kearney who arranged everything."
"德夫林小姐是因为赌气才成为卡尼太太的。她是在一家上流修道院受的教育，在那里她学会了法语和音乐。由于她生来体质羸弱，态度冷漠，因此她在学校里交到的朋友很少。当她到了结婚的年龄时，她被打发到许多人家做客，她的演奏水平和高雅的姿态都很受称赞。她身处于靠这些才艺形成的一个冷寂圈子里，坐等着某个求婚者来冲破这个圈子，带给她一种美好的生活。然而她遇到的年轻男子都很普通，于是她也就没有给他们任何鼓励，转而通过私下吃大量的土耳其软糖来慰藉自己那浪漫的欲望。然而，当她接近婚龄极限，而她的朋友们也渐渐管不住自己的舌头开始谈论她的时候，她为了堵上他们的嘴就嫁给了卡尼先生，他是奥蒙德码头上的一名鞋匠。","Miss Devlin had become Mrs. Kearney out of spite.She had been educated in a high-class convent, where she had learned French and music.As she was naturally pale and unbending in manner she made few friends at school.When she came to the age of marriage she was sent out to many houses, where her playing and ivory manners were much admired.She sat amid the chilly circle of her accomplishments, waiting for some suitor to brave it and offer her a brilliant life.But the young men whom she met were ordinary and she gave them no encouragement, trying to console her romantic desires by eating a great deal of Turkish Delight in secret.However, when she drew near the limit and her friends began to loosen their tongues about her, she silenced them by marrying Mr. Kearney, who was a bootmaker on Ormond Quay."
"他比她大许多岁。他那褐色的大络腮胡子下面不时会传出一些严肃的话语。婚后生活一年之后，卡尼太太意识到，这样一个男人要比一个浪漫之人更能经得起考验，不过她也从来没有撇开过自己那些浪漫的念头。他为人持重，生活俭朴，敬神而虔诚；每个月的第一个星期五他都会去圣坛，有时是和她一起去，但更多时候是他自己去。不过她的宗教信仰也从未冲淡过，而且对他来说她一直是一位好妻子。在陌生人家举办的某个聚会上，她只要稍微抬抬眉毛，他就会起身告辞，而当他咳嗽得难受的时候，她会把那条鸭绒被盖在他的脚上，然后再给他弄一杯烈性的朗姆潘趣酒。就他个人来说，他是一个模范父亲。每个星期他都会把一小笔钱缴纳给一个协会，以确保他的两个女儿在满二十四岁的时候每人都能有一百镑的嫁妆。他把大女儿凯瑟琳送到了一家不错的修道院，在那里她学会了法语和音乐，后来他又花钱供她读了大学。每年七月，卡尼太太总会找机会跟某个朋友说：","He was much older than she.His conversation, which was serious, took place at intervals in his great brown beard.After the first year of married life, Mrs. Kearney perceived that such a man would wear better than a romantic person, but she never put her own romantic ideas away.He was sober, thrifty and pious; he went to the altar every first Friday, sometimes with her, oftener by himself.But she never weakened in her religion and was a good wife to him.At some party in a strange house when she lifted her eyebrow ever so slightly he stood up to take his leave and, when his cough troubled him, she put the eider-down quilt over his feet and made a strong rum punch.For his part, he was a model father.By paying a small sum every week into a society, he ensured for both his daughters a dowry of one hundred pounds each when they came to the age of twenty-four.He sent the older daughter, Kathleen, to a good convent, where she learned French and music, and afterward paid her fees at the Academy.Every year in the month of July Mrs. Kearney found occasion to say to some friend:"
"“我的好丈夫正准备送我们去斯凯里思住几个星期。”","“My good man is packing us off to Skerries for a few weeks.”"
"如果不是斯凯里思，那就会是豪思或者是格雷斯通斯。","If it was not Skerries it was Howth or Greystones."
"当爱尔兰文艺复兴运动开始受到人们关注的时候，卡尼太太决定充分利用自己女儿的名字，还雇请了一位爱尔兰教师到家里来。凯瑟琳和妹妹把爱尔兰风景明信片寄给她们的朋友们，这些朋友们也会回寄给她们另一些爱尔兰风景明信片。在意义特别的星期天，卡尼先生会和家人一起去设立在新教区的代主教座堂，弥撒仪式之后会有一小群人聚集在教堂街的拐角处。他们都是卡尼一家的朋友——音乐方面的朋友或者是民族主义阵线的朋友；在彼此闲聊一阵之后，他们会同时互相握手（他们会因为这么多只手互相交叉而哈哈大笑），然后用爱尔兰语相互道别。很快，凯瑟琳·卡尼小姐的名字就开始常挂在人们的嘴边了。人们说她通晓音乐，是一个很不错的女孩，而且她还是语言运动的崇信者。卡尼太太对此非常满意。因此，当有一天霍洛汉先生找到她，说他们协会要在古音乐厅举办四场系列大型音乐会，想让她女儿出任伴奏时，她并没有感到意外。她引他来到客厅，请他就坐，又拿出了水瓶和银饼干桶。然后她就全身心地开始商谈这件事的细节，或是提出建议，或是表示反对：最后终于起草了一份合同。按合同规定，凯瑟琳将在这四场大型音乐会中担任伴奏，她会因此得到八个几尼。","When the Irish Revival began to be appreciable Mrs. Kearney determined to take advantage of her daughter’s name and brought an Irish teacher to the house.Kathleen and her sister sent Irish picture postcards to their friends and these friends sent back other Irish picture postcards.On special Sundays, when Mr. Kearney went with his family to the pro-cathedral, a little crowd of people would assemble after mass at the corner of Cathedral Street.They were all friends of the Kearneys—musical friends or Nationalist friends; and, when they had played every little counter of gossip, they shook hands with one another all together, laughing at the crossing of so many hands, and said good-bye to one another in Irish.Soon the name of Miss Kathleen Kearney began to be heard often on people’s lips.People said that she was very clever at music and a very nice girl and, moreover, that she was a believer in the language movement.Mrs. Kearney was well content at this.Therefore she was not surprised when one day Mr. Holohan came to her and proposed that her daughter should be the accompanist at a series of four grand concerts which his Society was going to give in the Antient Concert Rooms.She brought him into the drawing-room, made him sit down and brought out the decanter and the silver biscuit-barrel.She entered heart and soul into the details of the enterprise, advised and dissuaded: and finally a contract was drawn up by which Kathleen was to receive eight guineas for her services as accompanist at the four grand concerts."
"由于在诸如节目单的措辞和表演曲目的分配之类的细节事情上霍洛汉先生是个新手，因此卡尼太太就帮他来做。她很老练。她知道什么样的艺人应该用大写字母，什么样的艺人应该用小写字母。她知道，第一男高音不愿意跟在米德太太的喜剧节目之后上场。为了让观众的兴致能持续不减，她把那些拿不准的节目穿插在那些观众最喜爱的传统节目中间。霍洛汉先生每天都会来见她，听取她对某些方面的建议。她总是和善而乐于进言——实际上可以说是平易近人。她把水瓶推给他，说：","As Mr. Holohan was a novice in such delicate matters as the wording of bills and the disposing of items for a programme, Mrs. Kearney helped him.She had tact.She knew what artistes should go into capitals and what artistes should go into small type.She knew that the first tenor would not like to come on after Mr. Meade’s comic turn.To keep the audience continually diverted she slipped the doubtful items in between the old favourites.Mr. Holohan called to see her every day to have her advice on some point.She was invariably friendly and advising—homely, in fact.She pushed the decanter towards him, saying:"
"“好了，请自便，霍洛汉先生！”","“Now, help yourself, Mr. Holohan!”"
"在他自斟自饮的时候，她说道：","And while he was helping himself she said:"
"“别担心！别担心这件事儿！”","“Don’t be afraid!Don’t be afraid of it!”"
"一切进展顺利。卡尼夫人在布朗·托马斯的店铺里买了些可爱的娇粉色查米尤斯绉缎缝到了凯瑟琳裙子的前面。这花费了不小的一笔钱；不过有些场合花点钱也是有情可原的。她拿了十几张最后一场音乐会的那种两先令的票，把它们送给了那些没有赠票的话说不定就不来的朋友。她事无巨细都记得住，而且因为有她，该做的一切都做好了。","Everything went on smoothly.Mrs. Kearney bought some lovely blush-pink charmeuse in Brown Thomas’s to let into the front of Kathleen’s dress.It cost a pretty penny; but there are occasions when a little expense is justifiable.She took a dozen of two-shilling tickets for the final concert and sent them to those friends who could not be trusted to come otherwise.She forgot nothing, and, thanks to her, everything that was to be done was done."
"音乐会将会在星期三、星期四、星期五和星期六举行。当卡尼太太带着女儿在星期三晚上到达古音乐厅时，她不喜欢当时的场景。几个年轻人外套上别着亮蓝色的徽章，闲散地站在门厅处；他们没有一个人穿着晚礼服。她和女儿一道从旁边经过，大厅的门开着，她朝里面迅速一瞥，立刻明白了这些服务生们闲着无事的原因。起初她有些疑惑是不是自己记错了时间。没错，差二十分钟八点。","The concerts were to be on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday.When Mrs. Kearney arrived with her daughter at the Antient Concert Rooms on Wednesday night she did not like the look of things.A few young men, wearing bright blue badges in their coats, stood idle in the vestibule; none of them wore evening dress.She passed by with her daughter and a quick glance through the open door of the hall showed her the cause of the stewards’ idleness.At first she wondered had she mistaken the hour.No, it was twenty minutes to eight."
"在舞台后面的化妆室里，她被人引介给了协会的秘书菲茨帕特里克先生。她微笑着握了握他的手。他是个小个子男人，一张脸白皙而茫然。她注意到他很随意地把那顶褐色软帽戴在头的一侧，他说话的口音则平直无趣。他一只手里拿着一份节目单，在和她说话的时候，他把节目单的一角咬成了湿乎乎的一团。他似乎略微带着些失望。霍洛汉先生每隔几分钟就会来到化妆室报告售票处的情况。艺人们紧张地互相交谈着，时不时地照照镜子，一会儿卷起、一会儿又打开他们的乐谱。时间接近八点半的时候，大厅里那些为数很少的人们开始嚷嚷着要听音乐会了。菲茨帕特里克先生走了进来，茫然地冲厅里的人们微笑着说道：","In the dressing-room behind the stage she was introduced to the secretary of the Society, Mr. Fitzpatrick.She smiled and shook his hand.He was a little man, with a white, vacant face.She noticed that he wore his soft brown hat carelessly on the side of his head and that his accent was flat.He held a programme in his hand, and, while he was talking to her, he chewed one end of it into a moist pulp.He seemed to bear disappointments lightly.Mr. Holohan came into the dressing room every few minutes with reports from the box-office.The artistes talked among themselves nervously, glanced from time to time at the mirror and rolled and unrolled their music.When it was nearly half-past eight, the few people in the hall began to express their desire to be entertained.Mr. Fitzpatrick came in, smiled vacantly at the room, and said:"
"“好了，女士们，先生们。我想我们还是开始演出吧。”","“Well now, ladies and gentlemen.I suppose we’d better open the ball.”"
"卡尼太太对他那极其平淡无趣的最后一个音节投去鄙视的一瞥，然后鼓励地对女儿说道：","Mrs. Kearney rewarded his very flat final syllable with a quick stare of contempt, and then said to her daughter encouragingly:"
"“你准备好了吗，亲爱的？”","“Are you ready, dear?”"
"当她得着一个机会的时候，她把霍洛汉先生叫到了一边，让他解释这是怎么回事。霍洛汉先生不明白这是怎么回事。他说委员会安排四场音乐会犯了个错误：四场太多了。","When she had an opportunity, she called Mr. Holohan aside and asked him to tell her what it meant.Mr. Holohan did not know what it meant.He said that the committee had made a mistake in arranging for four concerts: four was too many."
"“还有那些艺人！”卡尼太太说，“当然了，他们已尽了全力，可他们的确不够好。”","“And the artistes!” said Mrs. Kearney.“Of course they are doing their best, but really they are not good.”"
"霍洛汉先生承认说这些艺人是不好，不过他说委员会已经决定头三场音乐会让他们随兴去演，而把所有有才能的人留到星期六的晚上。卡尼太太什么也没说，但是当台上平庸的节目一个接一个，而厅里那为数不多的观众变得越来越少的时候，她开始后悔自己不该为这样一场音乐会如此费心劳力。这场景有些地方她不喜欢，而菲茨帕特里克先生那茫然的微笑也让她很是恼火。然而，她什么都没说，等着看这一切会如何收场。音乐会不到十点就终场了，所有人都很快回家了。","Mr. Holohan admitted that the artistes were no good but the committee, he said, had decided to let the first three concerts go as they pleased and reserve all the talent for Saturday night.Mrs. Kearney said nothing, but, as the mediocre items followed one another on the platform and the few people in the hall grew fewer and fewer, she began to regret that she had put herself to any expense for such a concert.There was something she didn’t like in the look of things and Mr. Fitzpatrick’s vacant smile irritated her very much.However, she said nothing and waited to see how it would end. The concert expired shortly before ten, and everyone went home quickly."
"星期四晚上的音乐会观演的情况要好一些，不过卡尼太太很快发现屋子里满是纸片。观众们举止很不得体，好像这场音乐会是一场非正式的彩排。菲茨帕特里克先生似乎很享受；他根本没有意识到卡尼太太正恼怒地注意着他的行为。他站在幕布旁边，时不时地探出头去和楼座角落里的两个朋友相视而笑。在那天晚上的演出过程中，卡尼太太获悉星期五的音乐会要被取消了，委员会将竭尽所能来确保星期六晚上会有一个满座的票房。听到这个消息之后，她四下找起霍洛汉先生来。她在他举着一杯柠檬汁跛着脚朝一位年轻女士快步走去的时候拦住了他，问他这是不是真的。是的，这是真的。","The concert on Thursday night was better attended, but Mrs. Kearney saw at once that the house was filled with paper.The audience behaved indecorously, as if the concert were an informal dress rehearsal.Mr. Fitzpatrick seemed to enjoy himself; he was quite unconscious that Mrs. Kearney was taking angry note of his conduct.He stood at the edge of the screen, from time to time jutting out his head and exchanging a laugh with two friends in the corner of the balcony.In the course of the evening, Mrs. Kearney learned that the Friday concert was to be abandoned and that the committee was going to move heaven and earth to secure a bumper house on Saturday night.When she heard this, she sought out Mr. Holohan.She buttonholed him as he was limping out quickly with a glass of lemonade for a young lady and asked him was it true.Yes, it was true."
"“但是，这当然不会改动合同吧，”她说，“合同定的是四场音乐会。”","“But, of course, that doesn’t alter the contract,” she said.“The contract was for four concerts.”"
"霍洛汉先生似乎很着急；他建议她去和菲茨帕特里克先生说说。卡尼太太现在开始感到不安了。她把菲茨帕特里克先生从幕布那里叫过来，说她的女儿签的是四场音乐会的合同，根据合同条款她理应拿到规定的钱数，不管协会举办的是不是四场音乐会。菲茨帕特里克先生没能马上抓住问题的要点，他似乎无法解决这个难题，他说他将把这件事提交给委员会。卡尼太太的怒气开始显现在脸上，她使劲忍住没有问：","Mr. Holohan seemed to be in a hurry; he advised her to speak to Mr. Fitzpatrick.Mrs. Kearney was now beginning to be alarmed.She called Mr. Fitzpatrick away from his screen and told him that her daughter had signed for four concerts and that, of course, according to the terms of the contract, she should receive the sum originally stipulated for, whether the society gave the four concerts or not.Mr. Fitzpatrick, who did not catch the point at issue very quickly, seemed unable to resolve the difficulty and said that he would bring the matter before the committee.Mrs. Kearney’s anger began to flutter in her cheek and she had all she could do to keep from asking:"
"“那请问谁是委员会？”","“And who is the Cometty pray?”"
"不过她清楚那样做会很不文雅：于是她保持了沉默。","But she knew that it would not be ladylike to do that: so she was silent."
"星期五大清早，一些带着成扎传单的小男孩就被分派到了都柏林的所有主要街道上。特别的吹捧文章出现在了所有晚报上面，提醒爱好音乐的公众第二天晚上会有一场音乐的盛宴等待着他们的光临。卡尼太太稍微安心了些，不过她想最好还是把自己的部分疑虑告诉丈夫。他认真地听完之后说也许星期六晚上他和她一起去会好一些。她同意了。她尊重自己的丈夫，正如她尊重邮政总局那样，把他看作是高大、安全和稳固的化身；尽管她知道他少有才能，但她却很欣赏他作为一个男人的抽象价值。她很高兴他提出和她一道来。她仔细考虑着自己的计划。","Little boys were sent out into the principal streets of Dublin early on Friday morning with bundles of handbills.Special puffs appeared in all the evening papers, reminding the music loving public of the treat which was in store for it on the following evening.Mrs. Kearney was somewhat reassured, but she thought well to tell her husband part of her suspicions.He listened carefully and said that perhaps it would be better if he went with her on Saturday night.She agreed.She respected her husband in the same way as she respected the General Post Office, as something large, secure and fixed; and though she knew the small number of his talents she appreciated his abstract value as a male.She was glad that he had suggested coming with her.She thought her plans over."
"大型音乐会之夜来临了。卡尼太太与她的丈夫和女儿一起在音乐会开演前四十五分钟就来到了古音乐厅。不巧的是那天晚上正好下雨。卡尼太太把女儿的衣服和乐谱交给丈夫照看之后就开始在屋子里到处找霍洛汉先生或是菲茨帕特里克先生。她哪个都没找到。她问服务生们，委员会的成员有没有谁在厅里。费了好大麻烦之后，一个服务生才引出来一位名叫伯恩小姐的小个子女人，卡尼太太向她解释说自己想见见一位秘书。伯恩小姐正在随时恭候他们的到来，她问自己能否帮上什么忙。卡尼太太探寻地看看那张挤出一种充满信任和热情的略显苍老的脸，回答道：","The night of the grand concert came.Mrs. Kearney, with her husband and daughter, arrived at the Antient Concert Rooms three-quarters of an hour before the time at which the concert was to begin.By ill luck it was a rainy evening.Mrs. Kearney placed her daughter’s clothes and music in charge of her husband and went all over the building looking for Mr. Holohan or Mr. Fitzpatrick.She could find neither.She asked the stewards was any member of the committee in the hall and, after a great deal of trouble, a steward brought out a little woman named Miss Beirne to whom Mrs. Kearney explained that she wanted to see one of the secretaries.Miss Beirne expected them any minute and asked could she do anything.Mrs. Kearney looked searchingly at the oldish face which was screwed into an expression of trustfulness and enthusiasm and answered:"
"“不了，谢谢你！”","“No, thank you!”"
"那个小个子女人希望他们能有一个不错的票房。她看着外面的雨，直到湿乎乎的街道所具有的那种忧郁从她那拧结的五官上抹去所有的诚信与热情。然后她发出一声轻叹，说道：","The little woman hoped they would have a good house.She looked out at the rain until the melancholy of the wet street effaced all the trustfulness and enthusiasm from her twisted features.Then she gave a little sigh and said:"
"“啊，好了！我们尽力了，上天为证。”","“Ah, well!We did our best, the dear knows.”"
"卡尼太太只好返回了化妆室。","Mrs. Kearney had to go back to the dressing-room."
"艺人们陆续都到了。男低音和第二男高音也已经来了。男低音达根先生是个身材瘦长的年轻人，留着一撮稀疏的小黑胡子。他是城里一家办事处的一个前厅看门人的儿子，还是个小男孩的时候，他就曾在有回响的大厅里演唱过延长的低音音调。他从这种卑微的境况中不断提升自己，直到成为一名一流艺人。他曾参演过大型歌剧。一天晚上，一名歌剧艺人病倒了，他就在女王剧院出演了歌剧《玛里塔纳》中的国王。他饱含深情声音洪亮地演唱了自己的曲目，得到了观众的热烈欢迎；可不幸的是，他有一两次无心地用戴手套的手擦了擦鼻子，结果就把这种好印象给破坏掉了。他低调谦逊，不爱说话。他说“你们”的时候声音非常轻柔，轻得总是让人听不到，为了保护自己的嗓子，他从来不喝任何比奶更浓的东西。贝尔先生——那个第二男高音——则是一个金黄头发的小个子，他每年都会去角逐艺术节的奖项。在第四次参赛的时候，他获得了一枚铜牌。他非常紧张又非常嫉妒其他男高音，于是他就以一种热情洋溢的友善来掩饰自己紧张的嫉妒。他的幽默之处就在于让人们知道一场音乐会对他而言是怎样的一种煎熬。因此，当他看到达根先生时，他便走过去问道：","The artistes were arriving.The bass and the second tenor had already come.The bass, Mr. Duggan, was a slender young man with a scattered black moustache.He was the son of a hall porter in an office in the city and, as a boy, he had sung prolonged bass notes in the resounding hall.From this humble state he had raised himself until he had become a first-rate artiste.He had appeared in grand opera.One night, when an operatic artiste had fallen ill, he had undertaken the part of the king in the opera of Maritana at the Queen’s Theatre.He sang his music with great feeling and volume and was warmly welcomed by the gallery; but, unfortunately, he marred the good impression by wiping his nose in his gloved hand once or twice out of thoughtlessness.He was unassuming and spoke little.He said yous so softly that it passed unnoticed and he never drank anything stronger than milk for his voice’s sake.Mr. Bell, the second tenor, was a fair-haired little man who competed every year for prizes at the Feis Ceoil.On his fourth trial he had been awarded a bronze medal.He was extremely nervous and extremely jealous of other tenors and he covered his nervous jealousy with an ebullient friendliness.It was his humour to have people know what an ordeal a concert was to him.Therefore when he saw Mr. Duggan he went over to him and asked:"
"“你也在演出之列吗？”","“Are you in it too?”"
"“是的。”达根先生说。","“Yes,” said Mr. Duggan."
"贝尔先生冲着自己这位受难同伴大笑起来，他伸出手说：","Mr. Bell laughed at his fellow-sufferer, held out his hand and said:"
"“握握手！”","“Shake!”"
"卡尼太太从这两个年轻人身边走过，走到幕布的一端朝观众席看去。座位上正迅速坐满观众，一种令人愉悦的嘈杂声在观众席里传开来。她返回来悄悄地跟丈夫说起话来。他们的谈话显然是关于凯瑟琳的，因为他们俩常常会朝她看一眼，凯瑟琳正站着和她的一位民族党朋友女低音希利小姐闲谈。一个踽踽独行、脸色苍白的陌生女人走过房间。女人们用锐利的目光追随着那件穿在一个细瘦身躯上的褪了色的蓝裙子。有人说她是女高音格林夫人。","Mrs. Kearney passed by these two young men and went to the edge of the screen to view the house.The seats were being filled up rapidly and a pleasant noise circulated in the auditorium.She came back and spoke to her husband privately.Their conversation was evidently about Kathleen for they both glanced at her often as she stood chatting to one of her Nationalist friends, Miss Healy, the contralto.An unknown solitary woman with a pale face walked through the room.The women followed with keen eyes the faded blue dress which was stretched upon a meagre body.Someone said that she was Madam Glynn, the soprano."
"“我真想知道他们是从哪里把她挖出来的。”凯瑟琳对希利小姐说，“我确信我从来就没听说过她。”","“I wonder where did they dig her up,” said Kathleen to Miss Healy.“I’m sure I never heard of her.”"
"希利小姐只得笑了笑。正在这时，霍洛汉先生一瘸一拐地走进了化妆室，两位年轻女士就问他那个陌生女人是谁。霍洛汉先生说她是伦敦来的格林夫人。格林夫人在屋子的一角站定，面前僵硬地举着一卷乐谱，她那惊恐的目光不时地变换着方向。阴影把她那褪色的裙装遮掩了起来，但却报复似的落在了她锁骨后面的那个小坑里。大厅里的嘈杂声变得更响了。第一男高音和男中音一起到了。他们都衣着得体，身材健壮，满脸喜气，他们给在场的人们带来了一股华丽的气息。","Miss Healy had to smile.Mr. Holohan limped into the dressing-room at that moment and the two young ladies asked him who was the unknown woman.Mr. Holohan said that she was Madam Glynn from London.Madam Glynn took her stand in a corner of the room, holding a roll of music stiffly before her and from time to time changing the direction of her startled gaze.The shadow took her faded dress into shelter but fell revengefully into the little cup behind her collar-bone.The noise of the hall became more audible.The first tenor and the baritone arrived together.They were both well dressed, stout and complacent and they brought a breath of opulence among the company."
"卡尼太太带着女儿走到他们跟前，和他们亲切地攀谈起来。她想和他们处好关系，可是，在她竭力保持礼节的同时，她的目光却追随着霍洛汉先生那一瘸一拐来回走动的身影。等她一有机会，她就找借口离开，跟在他后面走了出去。","Mrs. Kearney brought her daughter over to them, and talked to them amiably.She wanted to be on good terms with them but, while she strove to be polite, her eyes followed Mr. Holohan in his limping and devious courses.As soon as she could she excused herself and went out after him."
"“霍洛汉先生，我想和你说会儿话。”她说。","“Mr. Holohan, I want to speak to you for a moment,” she said."
"他们走到走廊的一个僻静处。卡尼太太问他什么时候给她女儿报酬。霍洛汉先生说菲茨帕特里克先生负责这件事。卡尼太太说她根本就不认识菲茨帕特里克先生。她的女儿已经签了八个几尼的合同，她就应该要得到报酬。霍洛汉先生说这不关他的事。","They went down to a discreet part of the corridor.Mrs Kearney asked him when was her daughter going to be paid. Mr. Holohan said that Mr. Fitzpatrick had charge of that.Mrs. Kearney said that she didn’t know anything about Mr. Fitzpatrick.Her daughter had signed a contract for eight guineas and she would have to be paid. Mr. Holohan said that it wasn’t his business."
"“为什么不关你的事？”卡尼太太问，“难道不是你亲自把合同拿给她的吗？不管怎样，如果这不关你的事，那它就是我的事，我来负责这件事。”","“Why isn’t it your business?” asked Mrs. Kearney.“Didn’t you yourself bring her the contract?Anyway, if it’s not your business it’s my business and I mean to see to it.”"
"“你最好去和菲茨帕特里克先生谈谈。”霍洛汉先生冷漠地说。","“You’d better speak to Mr. Fitzpatrick,” said Mr. Holohan distantly."
"“我根本就不认识菲茨帕特里克先生，”卡尼太太重复道，“我有合同，我会确保合同履行。”","“I don’t know anything about Mr. Fitzpatrick,” repeated Mrs. Kearney.“I have my contract, and I intend to see that it is carried out.”"
"当她返回化妆室的时候，她的双颊略微泛着红晕。屋子里很热闹。两个身着户外套服的男人占据着壁炉前面的位置，正亲密地与希利小姐和那个男中音闲聊着。他们一个是《公民报》的人，一个是奥马登·伯克先生。那个《公民报》的人是来说自己等不及音乐会开演了，因为他得去报导一位美国神父正在市长官邸发表的演说。他说他们会把报道放在《公民报》的办公室，他会负责发表的。他是一个灰发男人，嗓音动听，举止谨慎。他的一只手里拿着一根已经熄灭的雪茄，雪茄的香味在他周身浮绕着。他本来片刻都没打算在这里呆，因为音乐会和艺人们都使他倍感无聊，可是他却依然斜靠在壁炉架上。希利小姐站在他的面前谈笑着。他已经足够成熟，因此对于她表现出的礼貌他持怀疑态度；可他心态却还依然年轻，因此就想利用好这个时机。她身体的温度、香味和色彩都触动着他的感官。他高兴地意识到，他所看见的在他面前一起一伏的那个胸部在那一刻是为了他才一起一伏，那笑声、香味和流转的眼神也全都是给他的献礼。当他无法再耽搁的时候，他遗憾地跟她道了别。","When she came back to the dressing-room her cheeks were slightly suffused.The room was lively.Two men in outdoor dress had taken possession of the fireplace and were chatting familiarly with Miss Healy and the baritone.They were the Freeman man and Mr. O’Madden Burke.The Freeman man had come in to say that he could not wait for the concert as he had to report the lecture which an American priest was giving in the Mansion House.He said they were to leave the report for him at the Freeman office and he would see that it went in.He was a grey-haired man, with a plausible voice and careful manners.He held an extinguished cigar in his hand and the aroma of cigar smoke floated near him.He had not intended to stay a moment because concerts and artistes bored him considerably but he remained leaning against the mantelpiece.Miss Healy stood in front of him, talking and laughing.He was old enough to suspect one reason for her politeness but young enough in spirit to turn the moment to account.The warmth, fragrance and colour of her body appealed to his senses.He was pleasantly conscious that the bosom which he saw rise and fall slowly beneath him rose and fell at that moment for him, that the laughter and fragrance and wilful glances were his tribute.When he could stay no longer he took leave of her regretfully."
"“奥马登·伯克会写报道，”他向霍洛汉先生解释道，“而我会负责发表。”","“O’Madden Burke will write the notice,” he explained to Mr. Holohan, “and I’ll see it in.”"
"“非常感谢您，亨德里克先生，”霍洛汉先生说，“您会负责发表，我知道。那走之前您不想再来点什么了吗？”","“Thank you very much, Mr. Hendrick,” said Mr. Holohan, “you’ll see it in, I know.Now, won’t you have a little something before you go?”"
"“可以啊。”亨德里克先生说。","“I don’t mind,” said Mr. Hendrick."
"这两个男人穿过一些迂回曲折的走廊，登上一截黑暗的楼梯，来到了一个隐蔽的房间，一个服务生正在那里给几位先生开瓶塞。其中一位就是奥马登·伯克先生，他是凭着直觉找到这个房间的。他是一个温文尔雅的老年人，在休息的时候，他会让自己那威武的身躯靠在一把大绸伞上来保持平衡。而他那夸张的西式名字则是一把道德的庇护伞，倚在上面可以让他解决自己在金钱方面的小问题。他广受尊敬。","The two men went along some tortuous passages and up a dark staircase and came to a secluded room where one of the stewards was uncorking bottles for a few gentlemen.One of these gentlemen was Mr. O’Madden Burke, who had found out the room by instinct.He was a suave, elderly man who balanced his imposing body, when at rest, upon a large silk umbrella.His magniloquent western name was the moral umbrella upon which he balanced the fine problem of his finances.He was widely respected."
"在霍洛汉先生款待《公民报》记者的时候，卡尼太太则正激动地和她丈夫交谈，她非常激动，以至于她丈夫不得不让她小点声。化妆室里其他人的谈话已经变得紧张起来。贝尔先生是第一个节目，他拿着乐谱站着做好了准备，可伴奏师却没有任何举动。显然什么地方出了问题。卡尼先生抚摸着自己的胡子直视着前方，而卡尼太太则在用压低了的强调语气贴着凯瑟琳的耳朵说着话。从大厅里传来了喝彩、鼓掌和跺脚的声音。第一男高音和男中音还有希利小姐站在一起，平静地等待着，可贝尔先生的神经却高度紧张，因为他担心观众会以为是他迟到了。","While Mr. Holohan was entertaining the Freeman man Mrs. Kearney was speaking so animatedly to her husband that he had to ask her to lower her voice.The conversation of the others in the dressing-room had become strained.Mr. Bell, the first item, stood ready with his music but the accompanist made no sign.Evidently something was wrong.Mr. Kearney looked straight before him, stroking his beard, while Mrs. Kearney spoke into Kathleen’s ear with subdued emphasis.From the hall came sounds of encouragement, clapping and stamping of feet.The first tenor and the baritone and Miss Healy stood together, waiting tranquilly, but Mr. Bell’s nerves were greatly agitated because he was afraid the audience would think that he had come late."
"霍洛汉先生和奥马登·伯克先生走进了房间。霍洛汉先生立刻觉察到了屋里的静寂。他走到卡尼太太跟前，认真地和她说起话来。在他们说话的时候，大厅里的嘈杂声越来越大。霍洛汉先生变得满脸通红，非常激动。他一个劲地说着，可卡尼太太却只是偶尔简短地说：","Mr. Holohan and Mr. O’Madden Burke came into the room. In a moment Mr. Holohan perceived the hush.He went over to Mrs. Kearney and spoke with her earnestly.While they were speaking the noise in the hall grew louder.Mr. Holohan became very red and excited.He spoke volubly, but Mrs. Kearney said curtly at intervals:"
"“她不会上场。她必须拿到她的八个几尼。”","“She won’t go on. She must get her eight guineas.”"
"霍洛汉先生绝望地指着大厅，观众们正在那里又是鼓掌又是跺脚。他恳求了卡尼先生和凯瑟琳。可卡尼先生却继续抚摸着自己的胡子，而凯瑟琳则低头看着下面，移动着穿着新鞋的一只脚的脚尖：这并非她的错。卡尼太太重复着：","Mr. Holohan pointed desperately towards the hall where the audience was clapping and stamping.He appealed to Mr Kearney and to Kathleen.But Mr. Kearney continued to stroke his beard and Kathleen looked down, moving the point of her new shoe: it was not her fault.Mrs. Kearney repeated:"
"“拿不到钱她就不会上场。”","“She won’t go on without her money.”"
"经过一阵短暂的舌战之后，霍洛汉先生慌慌张张一瘸一拐地走了出去。房间里静默无声。当这种静默带来的紧张变得有些令人痛苦的时候，希利小姐对男中音说道：","After a swift struggle of tongues Mr. Holohan hobbled out in haste.The room was silent.When the strain of the silence had become somewhat painful Miss Healy said to the baritone:"
"“这星期你见过帕特·坎贝尔太太吗？”","“Have you seen Mrs. Pat Campbell this week?”"
"男中音没有见过她，不过他听人说她非常好。谈话就此结束了。第一男高音低着头开始数围在他腰上的那条金链子的环数，他微笑着，随意哼唱着一些曲调来感受鼻腔的发音。每个人都会时不时地朝卡尼太太看一眼。","The baritone had not seen her but he had been told that she was very fine.The conversation went no further.The first tenor bent his head and began to count the links of the gold chain which was extended across his waist, smiling and humming random notes to observe the effect on the frontal sinus.From time to time everyone glanced at Mrs. Kearney."
"礼堂里的嘈杂声升级成了一片哄闹，这时菲茨帕特里克先生冲进了房间，后面跟着气喘吁吁的霍洛汉先生。大厅里的掌声和跺脚声不时被口哨声打断。菲茨帕特里克先生手里拿着一些钞票。他数出来四张放到了卡尼太太的手里，然后说在幕间休息的时候她会拿到另一半。卡尼太太说：","The noise in the auditorium had risen to a clamour when Mr. Fitzpatrick burst into the room, followed by Mr. Holohan who was panting.The clapping and stamping in the hall were punctuated by whistling.Mr. Fitzpatrick held a few banknotes in his hand.He counted out four into Mrs. Kearney’s hand and said she would get the other half at the interval.Mrs. Kearney said:"
"“这还短着四先令呢。”","“This is four shillings short.”"
"可凯瑟琳却提起裙子对演第一个节目的人说道：“好了，贝尔先生。”贝尔先生正浑身抖得像棵颤杨。","But Kathleen gathered in her skirt and said: “Now. Mr. Bell,” to the first item, who was shaking like an aspen."
"演唱者和伴奏者一起走了出去。厅里的噪声渐渐消停了下来。一开始有几秒钟的停顿：然后钢琴声响了起来。","The singer and the accompanist went out together.The noise in hall died away.There was a pause of a few seconds: and then the piano was heard."
"音乐会的第一部分非常成功，除了格林夫人的节目之外。这位可怜的女士用一种空虚气喘的嗓音演唱了《基拉尔尼之歌》，她用的全是些老式的声调和发音，因为她确信这样可以让她的演唱多一些优雅。她看起来就像是刚从一个古旧的舞台柜里复活过来一样，大厅里那些买低价票的观众取笑着她那些又高又尖的音调。然而第一男高音和男中音却博得了全场喝彩。凯瑟琳演奏了一组爱尔兰小调选曲，也赢得了很多掌声。第一部分是以一个激动人心的爱国诗朗诵节目结束的。表演者是一位组织业余戏剧演出的年轻女士。这个节目获得了应得的掌声；节目结束之后，男人们出去享受幕间休息，每个人都很满意。","The first part of the concert was very successful except for Madam Glynn’s item.The poor lady sang Killarney in a bodiless gasping voice, with all the old-fashioned mannerisms of intonation and pronunciation which she believed lent elegance to her singing.She looked as if she had been resurrected from an old stage-wardrobe and the cheaper parts of the hall made fun of her high wailing notes.The first tenor and the contralto, however, brought down the house.Kathleen played a selection of Irish airs which was generously applauded.The first part closed with a stirring patriotic recitation delivered by a young lady who arranged amateur theatricals.It was deservedly applauded; and, when it was ended, the men went out for the interval, content."
"整个这段时间，化妆室里的人都情绪激动。房间的一角站着霍洛汉先生、菲茨帕特里克先生、伯恩小姐、两个服务生、男中音、男低音以及奥马登·伯克先生。奥马登·伯克先生说这是他所目睹过的最令人愤慨的表现。凯瑟琳·卡尼小姐的音乐生涯此后在都柏林就算终结了，他说。男中音被问及他对卡尼太太的行为有何看法。他不愿意说什么。他拿到了自己那份钱，希望能和人们和平相处。不过，他说卡尼太太本来可以替艺人们多着想一些。服务生们和秘书们热烈地争论着幕间休息的时候该做些什么。","All this time the dressing-room was a hive of excitement.In one corner were Mr. Holohan, Mr. Fitzpatrick, Miss Beirne, two of the stewards, the baritone, the bass, and Mr. O‘Madden Burke.Mr. O’Madden Burke said it was the most scandalous exhibition he had ever witnessed.Miss Kathleen Kearney’s musical career was ended in Dublin after that, he said.The baritone was asked what did he think of Mrs. Kearney’s conduct.He did not like to say anything.He had been paid his money and wished to be at peace with men.However, he said that Mrs. Kearney might have taken the artistes into consideration.The stewards and the secretaries debated hotly as to what should be done when the interval came."
"“我同意伯恩小姐的提议，”奥马登·伯克先生说，“什么都不给她。”","“I agree with Miss Beirne,” said Mr. O’Madden Burke.“Pay her nothing.”"
"房间的另一个角落里呆着卡尼太太和她的丈夫、贝尔先生、希利小姐和那位朗诵爱国诗的年轻女士。卡尼太太说委员会如此对待她真是过分。她不遗余力，不惜代价，结果这就是她得到的回报。","In another corner of the room were Mrs. Kearney and her husband, Mr. Bell, Miss Healy and the young lady who had to recite the patriotic piece.Mrs. Kearney said that the Committee had treated her scandalously.She had spared neither trouble nor expense and this was how she was repaid."
"他们以为他们要对付的只是一个小女孩，所以他们就这么欺负她。但是她要向他们表明他们错了。如果她是个男人的话，他们根本不敢这样对待她。不过她会确保她女儿得到她的权利：她不会让人愚弄的。如果他们不支付给她全部的报酬，她就会让整个都柏林都知道这件事。当然了，就艺人们来说她感到很抱歉。可是她还能做什么呢？她拉拢第二男高音，他说他认为她受到了不好的待遇。然后她又拉拢希利小姐。希利小姐想加入另一群人的阵营，可她又不愿意这样做，因为她是凯瑟琳的好朋友，卡尼一家曾经常邀请她到家里做客。","They thought they had only a girl to deal with and that therefore, they could ride roughshod over her.But she would show them their mistake.They wouldn’t have dared to have treated her like that if she had been a man.But she would see that her daughter got her rights: she wouldn’t be fooled.If they didn’t pay her to the last farthing she would make Dublin ring.Of course she was sorry for the sake of the artistes.But what else could she do?She appealed to the second tenor who said he thought she had not been well treated.Then she appealed to Miss Healy.Miss Healy wanted to join the other group but she did not like to do so because she was a great friend of Kathleen’s and the Kearneys had often invited her to their house."
"第一部分刚一结束，菲茨帕特里克先生和霍洛汉先生就走到卡尼太太跟前告诉她说另外四个几尼会在委员会下周二开会之后付给她，另外，如果她的女儿不在第二部分演奏的话，委员会将视其为终止合同而不付给她任何报酬。","As soon as the first part was ended Mr. Fitzpatrick and Mr. Holohan went over to Mrs. Kearney and told her that the other four guineas would be paid after the committee meeting on the following Tuesday and that, in case her daughter did not play for the second part, the committee would consider the contract broken and would pay nothing."
"“我从来没见过什么委员会，”卡尼太太气愤地说，“我女儿签有合同。她应该把四英镑八便士拿到手，否则的话她一步也不会往那个舞台上迈的。”","“I haven’t seen any committee,” said Mrs. Kearney angrily.“My daughter has her contract.She will get four pounds eight into her hand or a foot she won’t put on that platform.”"
"“你令我很吃惊，卡尼太太。”霍洛汉先生说，“我从没想到你会这样对待我们。”","“I’m surprised at you, Mrs. Kearney,” said Mr. Holohan.“I never thought you would treat us this way.”"
"“那你们是以什么方式对待我的呢？”卡尼太太反问道。","“And what way did you treat me?” asked Mrs. Kearney."
"她满脸都是怒色，看上去仿佛她要揍人了。","Her face was inundated with an angry colour and she looked as if she would attack someone with her hands."
"“我在争取我的权利。”她说。","“I’m asking for my rights.” she said."
"“你本应该注意点体面的。”霍洛汉先生说。","“You might have some sense of decency,” said Mr. Holohan."
"“我本应该，真的吗？……当我询问我女儿何时能拿到报酬时，我却得不到一个合理的答复。”","“Might I, indeed?...And when I ask when my daughter is going to be paid I can’t get a civil answer.”"
"她把头一甩，换成一种傲慢的语气说道：","She tossed her head and assumed a haughty voice:"
"“你必须去跟秘书谈。这不关我的事。我可是个不管事的大人物。”","“You must speak to the secretary.It’s not my business.I’m a great fellow fol-the-diddle-I-do.”"
"“我一直以为你是个淑女呢。”霍洛汉先生一边说着，一边唐突地从她身边走开了。","“I thought you were a lady,” said Mr. Holohan, walking away from her abruptly."
"打那以后，卡尼太太的行为受到了各方的谴责：所有的人都赞同委员会的做法。她站在门口，由于愤怒而显得憔悴，她跟丈夫和女儿争吵着，一边还和他们比划着。她等待着，一直到第二部分快开始的时间，一心希望那些秘书们会来找她。不过希利小姐已经好心地同意了做一两次伴奏。卡尼太太只好站到一边以便让男中音和他的伴奏者走过去登上舞台。她一动不动地站了一会儿，就像是一尊愤怒的石像，当歌曲的前几个音符撞击她的耳朵时，她抓起女儿的风衣，对丈夫说道：","After that Mrs. Kearney’s conduct was condemned on all hands: everyone approved of what the committee had done.She stood at the door, haggard with rage, arguing with her husband and daughter, gesticulating with them.She waited until it was time for the second part to begin in the hope that the secretaries would approach her.But Miss Healy had kindly consented to play one or two accompaniments.Mrs. Kearney had to stand aside to allow the baritone and his accompanist to pass up to the platform.She stood still for an instant like an angry stone image and, when the first notes of the song struck her ear, she caught up her daughter’s cloak and said to her husband:"
"“叫辆出租车！”","“Get a cab!”"
"他立刻走了出去。卡尼太太用风衣裹住女儿跟在他的身后。在经过门口的时候，她停下来，怒视着霍洛汉先生的脸。","He went out at once.Mrs. Kearney wrapped the cloak round her daughter and followed him.As she passed through the doorway she stopped and glared into Mr. Holohan’s face."
"“我跟你还没完呢。”她说。","“I’m not done with you yet,” she said."
"“但是我跟你算是完了。”霍洛汉先生说。","“But I’m done with you,” said Mr. Holohan."
"凯瑟琳温顺地跟在母亲身后。霍洛汉先生开始在房间里踱来踱去，以便能让自己冷静下来，他感觉皮肤仿佛着火一般。","Kathleen followed her mother meekly.Mr. Holohan began to pace up and down the room, in order to cool himself for he his skin on fire."
"“这真是一位贤淑的女士！”他说,“哦，她是一位贤淑的女士！”","“That’s a nice lady!” he said.“O, she’s a nice lady!”"
"“你做了件正确的事情，霍洛汉。”奥马登·伯克先生身子倚在他那把雨伞上表示赞同地说道。","“You did the proper thing, Holohan,” said Mr. O’Madden Burke, poised upon his umbrella in approval."
"第十四章  天恩","CHAPTER 14 GRACE"
"当时在洗手间里的两位先生努力想把他扶起来：可是他却实在是无法站立。他蜷着身子躺在那段楼梯下面，他刚从上面摔下来。他们成功地帮他翻了个身。他的帽子已经滚出去几码远，他的衣服沾满了地板上的污秽物，他原本脸朝下地躺在那里。他的双眼闭着，呼吸里带着呼噜呼噜的声音。　一缕细细的血丝从他的嘴角流淌下来。","TWO GENTLEMEN who were in the lavatory at the time tried to lift him up: but he was quite helpless.He lay curled up at the foot of the stairs down which he had fallen.They succeeded in turning him over.His hat had rolled a few yards away and his clothes were smeared with the filth and ooze of the floor on which he had lain, face downwards.His eyes were closed and he breathed with a grunting noise.A thin stream of blood trickled from the corner of his mouth."
"那两位先生和一个酒吧男招待抬着他上了楼，然后又把他放到了酒吧的地板上。过了两分钟，他被一圈男人围了起来。酒吧经理问大家他是谁，谁和他一起来的。没人知道他是谁，不过一个酒吧男招待说他曾经为这位先生上过一小杯朗姆酒。","These two gentlemen and one of the curates carried him up the stairs and laid him down again on the floor of the bar.In two minutes he was surrounded by a ring of men.The manager of the bar asked everyone who he was and who was with him.No one knew who he was but one of the curates said he had served the gentleman with a small rum."
"“他是一个人吗？”经理问。","“Was he by himself?” asked the manager."
"“不，先生。当时有两位先生和他在一起。”","“No, sir.There was two gentlemen with him.”"
"“那他们现在在哪里？”","“And where are they?”"
"没人知道；一个声音说道：","No one knew; a voice said:"
"“给他透透气。他晕过去了。”","“Give him air.He’s fainted.”"
"围观者形成的圈子扩散开来，然后又有弹性似的缩了回去。那个男人头部附近的棋盘花纹地板上已经形成了一块奖牌大小的深色血迹。经理见那人脸色灰白，感到惊恐，于是派人去叫一个警察。","The ring of onlookers distended and closed again elastically.A dark medal of blood had formed itself near the man’s head on the tessellated floor.The manager, alarmed by the grey pallor of the man’s face, sent for a policeman."
"他的领子被松开，领结也被解开。他睁开眼睛有一小会儿，叹了口气，然后就又闭上了。抬他上楼的一位先生手里拿着一顶脏兮兮的礼帽。经理反复询问是否有人知道受伤的这个男人是谁或者他的朋友去哪里了。酒吧的门打开了，一名高大的警官走了进来。沿着巷子一路跟过来的一群人聚集在门外，透过窗玻璃使劲往里张望着。","His collar was unfastened and his necktie undone.He opened eyes for an instant, sighed and closed them again.One of gentlemen who had carried him upstairs held a dinged silk hat in his hand.The manager asked repeatedly did no one know who the injured man was or where had his friends gone.The door of the bar opened and an immense constable entered.A crowd which had followed him down the laneway collected outside the door, struggling to look in through the glass panels."
"经理立刻开始讲述他所了解到的情况。那位警官则听着，他是一个面容笨拙刻板的年轻人。他慢慢地左右转动着脑袋，又慢慢地从经理转向地板上的那个人，仿佛他害怕自己会成为某种错觉的受害者。接着他脱掉手套，从腰间取出一个小本，舔了舔铅笔芯，开始准备作记录。他用一种怀疑的外省口音问道：","The manager at once began to narrate what he knew.The constable, a young man with thick immobile features, listened.He moved his head slowly to right and left and from the manager to the person on the floor, as if he feared to be the victim some delusion.Then he drew off his glove, produced a small book from his waist, licked the lead of his pencil and made ready to indite.He asked in a suspicious provincial accent:"
"“这个人是谁？他的姓名和住址是什么？”","“Who is the man?What’s his name and address?”"
"一个身着自行车服的年轻人穿过旁观者的圈子走上前来。他马上跪在了那个伤者旁边，并叫人去拿水。那个警官也跪下来帮忙。那个年轻人把伤者嘴边的血迹洗掉，然后又叫人去拿一些白兰地来。那个警官用威严的声音重复了一遍这个命令，然后一个酒吧男招待端着杯子跑了过来。白兰地被强行灌进了那个男子的喉咙里。几秒钟之后，他睁开了眼睛，朝四周看了看。他看着这一圈人脸，然后明白了什么，就努力想站起来。","A young man in a cycling-suit cleared his way through the ring of bystanders.He knelt down promptly beside the injured man and called for water.The constable knelt down also to help.The young man washed the blood from the injured man’s mouth and then called for some brandy.The constable repeated the order in an authoritative voice until a curate came running with the glass.The brandy was forced down the man’s throat.In a few seconds he opened his eyes and looked about him.He looked at the circle of faces and then, understanding, strove to rise to his feet."
"“你现在好了吗？”那个身着自行车服的年轻人问道。","“You’re all right now?” asked the young man in the cycling-suit."
"“啊，没事。”那个受伤的人一边说着，一边努力想站起来。","“Sha,’s nothing,” said the injured man, trying to stand up."
"他被人帮扶着站了起来。经理说到去医院的事，还有一些旁观者也提了建议。那顶变了形的礼帽被放到了那个人的头上。那个警官问：","He was helped to his feet.The manager said something about a hospital and some of the bystanders gave advice.The battered silk hat was placed on the man’s head.The constable asked:"
"“你住在哪里？”","“Where do you live?”"
"那个人没有回答，只是开始捻弄起他那小胡子的两头来。他对自己的这次事故不大在乎。没什么，他说：只是一次小事故。他吐字很不清楚地说道。","The man, without answering, began to twirl the ends of his moustache.He made light of his accident.It was nothing, he said: only a little accident.He spoke very thickly."
"“你住在哪里？”警官重复道。","“Where do you live” repeated the constable."
"那个人说他们该替他去叫辆出租马车。正在争论这个问题的时候，一位身穿黄色乌尔斯特大衣、身材高大矫捷、皮肤白皙的先生远远地从酒吧的另一头走了过来。见此情景，他喊了起来：","The man said they were to get a cab for him. While the point was being debated a tall agile gentleman of fair complexion, wearing a long yellow ulster, came from the far end of the bar. Seeing the spectacle, he called out:"
"“哈罗，汤姆，老伙计！这是怎么了？”","“Hallo, Tom, old man!What’s the trouble?”"
"“啊，没什么。”那个人说。","“Sha,’s nothing,” said the man."
"新来的人打量了一下他面前这个可怜的人，然后转身对那位警官说：","The new-comer surveyed the deplorable figure before him and then turned to the constable, saying:"
"“好了，警官。我来送他回家。”","“It’s all right, constable.I’ll see him home.”"
"警官用手碰了一下帽盔回答道：","The constable touched his helmet and answered:"
"“好的，鲍尔先生！”","“All right, Mr. Power!”"
"“来吧，汤姆。”鲍尔先生一边说着一边搀起了他朋友的一只胳膊，“没有骨折。怎么样？你能走路吗？”","“Come now, Tom,” said Mr. Power, taking his friend by the arm.“No bones broken.What? Can you walk?”"
"穿自行车服的那个年轻人扶着那个人的另一只胳膊，人群从中间分开让出了路。","The young man in the cycling-suit took the man by the other arm and the crowd divided."
"“你怎么把自己搞成了这副邋遢样？”鲍尔先生问道。","“How did you get yourself into this mess?” asked Mr. Power."
"“这位先生从楼梯上摔了下去。”那个年轻人说。","“The gentleman fell down the stairs,” said the young man."
"“我灰昂安谢你，先生。”那个受伤的人说。","“I‘ ’ery ‘uch o’liged to you, sir,” said the injured man."
"“不客气。”","“Not at all.”"
"“兰道我们不来点……？”","“’ant we have a little...?”"
"“现在不了。现在不了。”","“Not now.Not now.”"
"三个人离开了酒吧，人群也四散着从几个出口进了巷子。经理把那位警官带到那段楼梯检查事故现场。他们都认为那位先生一定是没有站稳。顾客们都回到了吧台边，一个酒吧男招待开始清除地板上的血迹。","The three men left the bar and the crowd sifted through the doors into the laneway.The manager brought the constable to the stairs to inspect the scene of the accident.They agreed that the gentleman must have missed his footing.The customers returned to the counter and a curate set about removing the traces of blood from the floor."
"当他们来到格拉夫顿大街的时候，鲍尔先生吹了声口哨拦下了一辆两轮马车。那个受伤的人又尽可能清楚地开口了。","When they came out into Grafton Street, Mr. Power whistled for an outsider.The injured man said again as well as he could."
"“我灰昂安谢你，先生。我希望我们会再厌面。偶的名是克南。”","“I‘ ’ery ‘uch o’liged to you, sir.I hope we’ll ‘eet again.’y na’e is Kernan.”"
"惊吓和渐渐感觉到的疼痛在一定程度上使他清醒了过来。","The shock and the incipient pain had partly sobered him."
"“不客气。”那个年轻人说。","“Don’t mention it,” said the young man."
"他们握了握手。克南先生被扶上了车，在鲍尔先生给车夫说前行的方向时，克南先生还对那个年轻人表达着自己的感激之情，并且还很遗憾他们不能一起喝点什么。","They shook hands.Mr. Kernan was hoisted on to the car and, while Mr. Power was giving directions to the carman, he expressed his gratitude to the young man and regretted that they could not have a little drink together."
"“下次吧。”那个年轻人说。","“Another time,” said the young man."
"马车朝威斯特摩兰街驶去。在车经过压舱物事务局时，大钟显示的时间是九点半。一阵强劲的东风朝他们袭来，是从河口处刮过来的。克南先生由于冷而蜷缩成一团。他的朋友让他讲讲这场事故是如何发生的。","The car drove off towards Westmoreland Street.As it passed Ballast Office the clock showed half-past nine.A keen east wind hit them, blowing from the mouth of the river.Mr. Kernan was huddled together with cold.His friend asked him to tell how the accident had happened."
"“我养不了，”他回答道，“偶的舌头受伤了。”","“I‘an’t ’an,” he answered, “‘y ’ongue is hurt.”"
"“给我看看。”","“Show.”"
"朋友把身体探过去，朝克南先生的嘴里瞅了瞅，但他却什么都看不见。他擦亮了一根火柴，双手围拢护着火苗，又朝克南先生乖乖张开着的嘴里瞅了瞅。马车的来回晃动使得火柴离那张开的嘴巴忽远忽近。下齿和牙龈沾满了凝结的血块，舌头的一小块好像已经被咬掉了。火柴被吹灭了。","The other leaned over the well of the car and peered into Mr. Kernan’s mouth but he could not see.He struck a match and, sheltering it in the shell of his hands, peered again into the mouth which Mr. Kernan opened obediently.The swaying movement of the car brought the match to and from the opened mouth.The lower teeth and gums were covered with clotted blood and a minute piece of the tongue seemed to have been bitten off.The match was blown out."
"“真是难看。”鲍尔先生说。","“That’s ugly,” said Mr. Power."
"“呵，阿没什么。”克南先生边说边闭上了嘴，然后又把他那件脏外套的领子拉过脖子。","“Sha, ’s nothing,” said Mr. Kernan, closing his mouth and pulling the collar of his filthy coat across his neck."
"克南先生是一个老派的旅行推销员，这派推销员坚信这个行当是要讲体面的。在城里人们见到他的时候，他没有一次不是戴着一顶颇显体面的礼帽，绑着一副绑腿。借助于这两件服饰，他说，一个男人就总能让人觉得够格。他继承了他那行当的拿破仑（即伟大的布莱克·怀特）的传统，他有时会通过传说和模仿唤起对他的回忆。现代商业手段已给予了他一些东西，但也仅限于让他在克罗街有了一间小办公室，办公室的百叶窗上写着公司的名称和地址——伦敦中东区。在这间小办公室的壁炉架上摆着一小排铅罐，窗户前面的那张桌子上放着四五个瓷碗，里面常常会倒有半满的某种黑色液体。克南先生正是用这些碗来品茶的。他先喝上一大口，含在嘴里，让茶水充分地浸润他的上颚，然后会朝前把它吐到炉灰中。然后他会停下来进行品评。","Mr. Kernan was a commercial traveller of the old school which believed in the dignity of its calling.He had never been seen in the city without a silk hat of some decency and a pair of gaiters.By grace of these two articles of clothing, he said, a man could always pass muster.He carried on the tradition of his Napoleon, the great Blackwhite, whose memory he evoked at times by legend and mimicry.Modern business methods had spared him only so far as to allow him a little office in Crowe Street, on the window blind of which was written the name of his firm with the address—London, E. C. On the mantelpiece of this little office a little leaden battalion of canisters was drawn up and on the table before the window stood four or five china bowls which were usually half full of a black liquid.From these bowls Mr. Kernan tasted tea.He took a mouthful, drew it up, saturated his palate with it and then spat it forth into the grate.Then he paused to judge."
"鲍尔先生要年轻许多，他受雇于都柏林城堡里的皇家爱尔兰警察局。他的社会地位日益升高，而他朋友的地位却日渐衰落，不过因为克南先生在成功的巅峰时期结识的朋友中还有一些依旧把他看作一个可敬的人，因此这种衰落的状况有所缓和。鲍尔先生就是这些朋友中的一个。他那些说不清的债务在他的圈子里已经成为一个笑柄；并且他是一个温文有礼的年轻人。","Mr. Power, a much younger man, was employed in the Royal Irish Constabulary Office in Dublin Castle.The arc of his social rise intersected the arc of his friend’s decline, but Mr. Kernan’s decline was mitigated by the fact that certain of those friends who had known him at his highest point of success still esteemed him as a character.Mr. Power was one of these friends.His inexplicable debts were a byword in his circle; he was a debonair young man."
"马车在格拉斯奈文路上的一栋小房子前停了下来，克南先生被扶进了那栋房子。他的妻子把他安顿到床上，而鲍尔先生则坐在楼下的厨房里询问孩子们在哪里上学以及他们在读什么书。孩子们——两个女孩和一个男孩——知道父亲无力顾及他们而母亲也不在身边，于是就开始和他嬉闹起来。他对他们的举止和口音都感到很吃惊，于是他的思绪渐上眉梢。片刻之后克南太太走进了厨房，惊呼道：","The car halted before a small house on the Glasnevin road and Mr. Kernan was helped into the house.His wife put him to bed while Mr. Power sat downstairs in the kitchen asking the children where they went to school and what book they were in.The children—two girls and a boy, conscious of their father helplessness and of their mother’s absence, began some horseplay with him.He was surprised at their manners and at their accents, and his brow grew thoughtful.After a while Mrs. Kernan entered the kitchen, exclaiming:"
"“真不像样！啊，他总有一天会自食其果，这肯定错不了。他从星期五开始就一直在喝酒。”","“Such a sight!O, he’ll do for himself one day and that’s the holy alls of it. He’s been drinking since Friday.”"
"鲍尔先生小心谨慎地给她解释说他没有责任，他只是非常偶然才碰上了这场面。克南太太想起了发生家庭纠纷的时候鲍尔先生的好心帮忙，还有许多次他所给予的小量但却及时的解囊相助，于是说道：","Mr. Power was careful to explain to her that he was not responsible, that he had come on the scene by the merest accident.Mrs. Kernan, remembering Mr. Power’s good offices during domestic quarrels, as well as many small, but opportune loans, said:"
"“哦，您不必和我说这些，鲍尔先生。我知道您是他的朋友，不像其他和他呆在一起的人。只要他口袋里有钱，并且远离妻子家人，他们就挺好。真是好朋友啊！我真想知道，今晚他是和谁在一起？”","“O, you needn’t tell me that, Mr. Power.I know you‘re a friend of his, not like some of the others he does be with.They’re all right so long as he has money in his pocket to keep him out from his wife and family.Nice friends!Who was he with tonight, I’d like to know?”"
"鲍尔先生摇了摇头但却什么也没说。","Mr. Power shook his head but said nothing."
"“我很抱歉，”她继续说道，“这屋子里也没啥东西可以招待您。不过如果您能等会儿的话，我就让人到福加蒂店铺里买点什么回来，就在街角那儿。”","“I’m so sorry,” she continued, “that I’ve nothing in the house to offer you.But if you wait a minute I’ll send round to Fogarty’s, at the corner.”"
"鲍尔先生站起来。","Mr. Power stood up."
"“我们一直等着他能带钱回家来。他似乎从来都想不起他还有个家。”","“We were waiting for him to come home with the money.He never seems to think he has a home at all.”"
"“哦，好了，克南太太，”鲍尔先生说，“我们会让他掀开新的一页的。我会跟马丁谈谈。他是合适的人选。我们会在这几天抽个晚上过来谈谈这件事。”","“O, now, Mrs. Kernan,” said Mr. Power, “we’ll make him turn over a new leaf.I’ll talk to Martin.He’s the man.We’ll come here one of these nights and talk it over.”"
"她送他到门口。车夫正在小道上跺着脚来回走动着，他挥动着胳膊以便让自己暖和一些。","She saw him to the door.The carman was stamping up and down the footpath, and swinging his arms to warm himself."
"“您能送他回家真是太好了。”她说。","“It’s very kind of you to bring him home,” she said."
"“不客气。”鲍尔先生说。","“Not at all,” said Mr. Power."
"他上了马车。车子驶离的时候，他欢快地冲她举起了帽子。","He got up on the car.As it drove off he raised his hat to her gaily."
"“我们会让他重新做人的。”他说，“晚安，克南太太。”","“We’ll make a new man of him,” he said.“Good-night, Mrs. Kernan.”"
"克南太太迷茫的双眼注视着那辆马车直到它从视线中消失。然后她收回了目光，走进房子里，倒空了丈夫所有的口袋。","Mrs. Kernan’s puzzled eyes watched the car till it was out of sight.Then she withdrew them, went into the house and emptied her husband’s pockets."
"她是一个积极务实的中年女人。不久前她刚刚庆祝了自己的银婚纪念日，在鲍尔先生的伴奏下她还跟丈夫跳了华尔兹，从而恢复了和丈夫的亲密关系。在她恋爱的那些日子里，克南先生在她看来是一个不乏殷勤的人：如今只要听说有婚礼举行，她仍会赶到教堂门口，一边看着一对新人，一边怀着鲜活的喜悦回忆当年自己斜倚在一个快乐的胖男人的胳膊上从桑迪芒特的海洋之星教堂走出来的情景。他衣冠整洁，身穿一件长外衣，一条淡紫色长裤，一只胳膊上优雅地端放着一顶丝质礼帽。但三个星期之后，她就发现为人妻子的生活是令人厌烦的，再后来，当她开始发现这种生活无法忍受的时候，她已经当了母亲。母亲的职责没有带给她什么不可克服的困难，二十五年来，她为自己的丈夫精明地操持着家。她的两个年长的儿子都已经开始做事。一个是在格拉斯哥的一家窗帘店，另一个是给贝尔法斯特的一个茶商当职员。他们都是好儿子，经常写信，有时还给家里寄钱回来。其他几个孩子都还在上学。","She was an active, practical woman of middle age. Not long before she had celebrated her silver wedding and renewed her intimacy with her husband by waltzing with him to Mr. Power’s accompaniment.In her days of courtship, Mr. Kernan had seemed to her a not ungallant figure: and she still hurried to the chapel door whenever a wedding was reported and, seeing the bridal pair, recalled with vivid pleasure how she had passed out of the Star of the Sea Church in Sandymount, leaning on the arm of a jovial well-fed man, who was dressed smartly in a frock-coat and lavender trousers and carried a silk hat gracefully balanced upon his other arm.After three weeks she had found a wife’s life irksome and, later on, when she was beginning to find it unbearable, she had become a mother.The part of mother presented to her no insuperable difficulties and for twenty-five years she had kept house shrewdly for her husband.Her two eldest sons were launched.One was in a draper’s shop in Glasgow and the other was clerk to a tea-merchant in Belfast.They were good sons, wrote regularly and sometimes sent home money.The other children were still at school."
"第二天，克南先生给办公室送了封信，然后依旧卧床休息。她给他做了牛肉茶，并且狠狠地指责了他一番。她把他经常的饮酒无度看得和天气变化一样，一旦他病了，她就会尽职尽责地使他康复，并且总是设法让他吃早饭。还有更糟糕的丈夫呢。自从男孩们长大以后，他就再也没有粗暴地对待过她，而且她知道，哪怕是为了订制一件小东西，他也会在汤姆斯街上来回走一遍。","Mr. Kernan sent a letter to his office next day and remained in bed.She made beef-tea for him and scolded him roundly.She accepted his frequent intemperance as part of the climate, healed him dutifully whenever he was sick and always tried to make him eat a breakfast.There were worse husbands.He had never been violent since the boys had grown up, and she knew that he would walk to the end of Thomas Street and back again to book even a small order."
"两个晚上之后，他的朋友们来看他了。她把他们领到他的卧室，房间里弥漫着一种病人的味道，她给他们在炉火边安排了座位。克南先生的舌头偶尔发作的刺痛让他在白天的时候多少有些易怒，不过现在脾气变得好了些。他坐在床上，背靠着枕头，浮肿的脸颊上几乎没有血色，这让他看上去就像是温热的灰烬。他向客人们道歉说屋子里很乱，不过与此同时他又略有些自豪地看着他们，那是一种老练之人的自豪。","Two nights after, his friends came to see him.She brought them up to his bedroom, the air of which was impregnated with a personal odour, and gave them chairs at the fire.Mr. Kernan’s tongue, the occasional stinging pain of which had made him somewhat irritable during the day, became more polite.He sat propped up in the bed by pillows and the little colour in his puffy cheeks made them resemble warm cinders.He apologised to his guests for the disorder of the room, but at the same time looked at them a little proudly, with a veteran’s pride."
"他根本就没有意识到自己成了一个计谋的牺牲品。他的朋友们，坎宁安先生、麦克伊先生以及鲍尔先生已经在客厅里向克南太太透露了这个计谋。主意是鲍尔先生出的，不过进一步扩展的任务交给了坎宁安先生。克南先生是新教徒出身，尽管后来结婚的时候改信了天主教，但他二十年来却一直未曾接受教堂的约束。他甚至还喜欢对天主教进行侧面攻击。","He was quite unconscious that he was the victim of a plot which his friends, Mr. Cunningham, Mr. M’Coy and Mr. Power had disclosed to Mrs. Kernan in the parlour.The idea had been Mr. Power’s, but its development was entrusted to Mr. Cunningham.Mr. Kernan came of Protestant stock and, though he had been converted to the Catholic faith at the time of his marriage, he had not been in the pale of the Church for twenty years.He was fond, moreover, of giving side-thrusts at Catholicism."
"坎宁安先生是应对这种情况的最佳人选。他是鲍尔先生的一位同事，比鲍尔先生年长一些。他自己的家庭生活也不是非常幸福。人们都对他怀有深切的同情，因为大家都知道他娶了一个很不体面的女人，她是个不可救药的酒鬼。他已经因为她置过六次家；每次她都会把他的家具典当一空。","Mr. Cunningham was the very man for such a case.He was an elder colleague of Mr. Power.His own domestic life was not very happy.People had great sympathy with him, for it was known that he had married an unpresentable woman who was an incurable drunkard.He had set up house for her six times; and each time she had pawned the furniture on him."
"大家都很尊敬可怜的马丁·坎宁安。他是个非常明理之人，很有影响力，也很有才智。他对人性的了解，他那因长期在警署的法庭上接触各种案件而加深的天生的足智多谋，由于偶尔会沉浸在通俗哲学的水域中，又多少磨去了些锋芒。他见多识广。他的朋友们对他的看法总是俯首称是，认为他的脸就像是莎士比亚的脸。","Everyone had respect for poor Martin Cunningham.He was a thoroughly sensible man, influential and intelligent.His blade of human knowledge, natural astuteness particularised by long association with cases in the police courts, had been tempered by brief immersions in the waters of general philosophy.He was well informed.His friends bowed to his opinions and considered that his face was like Shakespeare’s."
"当他们把这个计谋透露给克南太太的时候，她说：","When the plot had been disclosed to her, Mrs. Kernan had said:"
"“我把这件事全交到您手里了，坎宁安先生。”","“I leave it all in your hands, Mr. Cunningham.”"
"经过了四分之一世纪的婚姻生活之后，她留存下来的幻想已是少之又少了。宗教对于她而言是一种习惯，她怀疑像她丈夫这个年纪的人直到死也不会再有很大改变了。她不禁觉得他的这次事故发生的时机恰到好处，要不是她不想显得冷血无情的话，她甚至会告诉这几位先生说克南先生的舌头就算短一截也不要紧。然而，坎宁安先生是一个能干之人；再说宗教就是宗教。这个计划或许会有好处，至少，它不会有什么害处。她的信念并不过分。她坚信在所有的天主教祈祷式中圣心祈祷式是最普遍适用的一种，她也赞同做各种圣礼。她的信念受到了厨房的束缚，不过，要是身处困境的话，她也会相信班希和圣灵。","After a quarter of a century of married life, she had very few illusions left.Religion for her was a habit, and she suspected that a man of her husband’s age would not change greatly before death.She was tempted to see a curious appropriateness in his accident and, but that she did not wish to seem bloody-minded, would have told the gentlemen that Mr. Kernan’s tongue would not suffer by being shortened.However, Mr. Cunningham was a capable man; and religion was religion.The scheme might do good and, at least, it could do no harm.Her beliefs were not extravagant.She believed steadily in the Sacred Heart as the most generally useful of all Catholic devotions and approved of the sacraments.Her faith was bounded by her kitchen, but, if she was put to it, she could believe also in the banshee and in the Holy Ghost."
"先生们开始谈论起这次事故。坎宁安先生说他曾经听说过一起类似事件。一个七十岁的老人在癫痫病发作的时候咬掉了自己的一小块舌头，后来舌头又长好了，谁都看不出来被咬过的痕迹。","The gentlemen began to talk of the accident.Mr. Cunningham said that he had once known a similar case.A man of seventy had bitten off a piece of his tongue during an epileptic fit and the tongue had filled in again, so that no one could see a trace of the bite."
"“呃，我没有七十岁。”病人说。","“Well, I’m not seventy,” said the invalid."
"“愿上帝禁止此类事情发生。”坎宁安先生说。","“God forbid,” said Mr. Cunningham."
"“现在你不觉得疼了吧？”麦克伊先生问。","“It doesn’t pain you now?” asked Mr. M’Coy."
"麦克伊先生曾是一位小有名气的男高音。他的妻子曾经是一名女高音，如今依然在教小孩子们弹钢琴，收费低廉。他的生活轨迹并非是两点一线那么简单，他曾经暂时被迫靠骗人过日子。他曾在米德兰德铁路局做过职员，曾为《爱尔兰时报》和《自由公民杂志》做过广告推销员，还做过一家煤炭公司的授权城镇旅行推销员，还做过私家侦探和副治安官办公室的职员，最近他刚刚成为了城市验尸官的秘书。他的新职位使他对克南先生这件事产生了职业兴趣。","Mr. M’Coy had been at one time a tenor of some reputation.His wife, who had been a soprano, still taught young children to play the piano at low terms.His line of life had not been the shortest distance between two points and for short periods he had been driven to live by his wits.He had been a clerk in the Midland Railway, a canvasser for advertisements for The Irish Times and for The Freeman’s Journal, a town traveller for a coal firm on commission, a private inquiry agent, a clerk in the office of the Sub-Sheriff, and he had recently become secretary to the City Coroner.His new office made him professionally interested in Mr. Kernan’s case."
"“疼？不厉害。”克南先生回答道，“可就是很让人恶心。我总觉得想吐。”","“Pain?Not much,” answered Mr. Kernan.“But it’s so sickening.I feel as if I wanted to retch off.”"
"“这是喝酒过度引起的。”坎宁安先生肯定地说道。","“That’s the boose,” said Mr. Cunningham firmly."
"“不，”克南先生说。“我觉得我是在马车上着凉了。总有东西不断地往喉咙里涌，痰还是——”","“No,” said Mr. Kernan.“I think I caught cold on the car.There’s something keeps coming into my throat, phlegm or——”"
"“黏液。”麦克伊先生说。","“Mucus.” said Mr. M’Coy."
"“它总是好像从下面涌到喉咙里；直让人恶心。”","“It keeps coming like from down in my throat; sickening.”"
"“没错，没错，”麦克伊先生说，“这是胸腔的问题。”","“Yes, yes,” said Mr. M’Coy, “that’s the thorax.”"
"他带着一种质疑的神情同时看着坎宁安先生和鲍尔先生。坎宁安先生迅速点了点头，而鲍尔先生则说道：","He looked at Mr. Cunningham and Mr. Power at the same time with an air of challenge.Mr. Cunningham nodded his head rapidly and Mr. Power said:"
"“啊，好了，结果好就一切都好。”","“Ah, well, all’s well that ends well.”"
"“我非常感激你，老伙计。”病人说。","“I’m very much obliged to you, old man,” said the invalid."
"鲍尔先生摆了摆手。","Mr. Power waved his hand."
"“当时和我在一起的那两个家伙——”","“Those other two fellows I was with——”"
"“你跟谁在一起？”坎宁安先生问。","“Who were you with?” asked Mr. Cunningham."
"“一个伙计。我不知道他的姓名。真该死，他的名字是什么呢？小个子，长着沙色头发……”","“A chap.I don’t know his name.Damn it now, what’s his name?Little chap with sandy hair....”"
"“还有谁？”","“And who else?”"
"“哈福德。”","“Harford.”"
"“哼。”坎宁安先生说。","“Hm,” said Mr. Cunningham."
"坎宁安先生哼了那声之后，大家就都沉默不语了。人们都知道这个说话的人有秘密的消息来源。在此刻这种情形中，这个单音节词具有一种道德意味。哈福德先生有时会组织一小队人员，在星期天正午过后离开市区，以期能尽快赶到市郊的某个酒馆，在那里这些成员会郑重其事地自封为真正的旅行者。可他的旅行同伴们却从来都不愿意忽视他的出身。他是作为一个不起眼的投资商起家的，通过放高利贷借给工人们小额钱款。后来他成了利菲贷款银行的戈德伯格先生（一个异常肥胖的矮个子先生）的生意伙伴。尽管他从来也没有接受过犹太人职业守则之外的东西，但他的那些天主教教友们，每次个人或作为委托人被他催债而感到痛苦时都会愤恨地说他是个爱尔兰犹太人和一个无知的人，他们在他那白痴儿子身上看到了上天对高利贷有多么不满。而其他时候他们却总是记着他的优点。","When Mr. Cunningham made that remark, people were silent.It was known that the speaker had secret sources of information.In this case the monosyllable had a moral intention.Mr. Harford sometimes formed one of a little detachment which left the city shortly after noon on Sunday with the purpose of arriving as soon as possible at some public-house on the outskirts of the city where its members duly qualified themselves as bona fide travellers.But his fellow-travellers had never consented to overlook his origin.He had begun life as an obscure financier by lending small sums of money to workmen at usurious interest.Later on he had become the partner of a very fat, short gentleman, Mr. Goldberg, in the Liffey Loan Bank.Though he had never embraced more than the Jewish ethical code, his fellow-Catholics, whenever they had smarted in person or by proxy under his exactions, spoke of him bitterly as an Irish Jew and an illiterate, and saw divine disapproval of usury made manifest through the person of his idiot son. At other times they remembered his good points."
"“我想知道他究竟去了哪里。”克南先生说。","“I wonder where did he go to,” said Mr. Kernan."
"他希望这次事件的细节能一直这么模糊不清。他希望他的朋友们会以为是出了什么差错，哈福德先生和他彼此未能见面。他的朋友们十分清楚喝酒时哈福德先生的举止，所以大家都一言不发。鲍尔先生再次说道：","He wished the details of the incident to remain vague.He wished his friends to think there had been some mistake, that Mr. Harford and he had missed each other.His friends, who knew quite well Mr. Harford’s manners in drinking, were silent.Mr. Power said again:"
"“结果好就一切都好。”","“All’s well that ends well.”"
"克南先生立刻转移了话题。","Mr. Kernan changed the subject at once."
"“那是个正派的年轻人，那个帮着治疗的人。”他说，“多亏了他——”","“That was a decent young chap, that medical fellow,” he said.“Only for him——”"
"“哦，多亏了他，”鲍尔先生说，“要不很可能要被关押七天，还不能选择交罚款了事。”","“O, only for him,” said Mr. Power, “it might have been a case of seven days, without the option of a fine.”"
"“是啊，是啊，”克南先生一边说着，一边极力回想着，“我现在记起来还有一个警察。正直的年轻人，他看起来像是那样。这事到底是怎么发生的？”","“Yes, yes,” said Mr. Kernan, trying to remember.“I remember now there was a policeman.Decent young fellow, he seemed.How did it happen at all?”"
"“事情是你醉得一塌糊涂，汤姆。”坎宁安先生严肃地说。","“It happened that you were peloothered, Tom,” said Mr. Cunningham gravely."
"“陈述属实。”克南先生同样严肃地说道。","“True bill,” said Mr. Kernan, equally gravely."
"“我想是你搞定的那个警察吧，杰克。”麦克伊先生说。","“I suppose you squared the constable, Jack,” said Mr. M’Coy."
"鲍尔先生不喜欢别人只用他的名字来称呼他。他并非拘谨古板之人，但是他却无法忘记，麦克伊先生最近曾劳师动众到处搜罗手提包和行李箱，为的是能让麦克伊太太到乡村去赴那些凭空想象出来的约会。他成了牺牲品，这让他怨恨不已，但更让他怨恨的是如此低劣地玩弄把戏。因此，他回答了那个问题，仿佛是克南先生问的一样。","Mr. Power did not relish the use of his Christian name.He was not straight-laced, but he could not forget that Mr. M‘Coy had recently made a crusade in search of valises and portmanteaus to enable Mrs. M’Coy to fulfil imaginary engagements in the country.More than he resented the fact that he had been victimised he resented such low playing of the game.He answered the question, therefore, as if Mr. Kernan had asked it."
"讲述这件事让克南先生感到愤愤不平。他非常在意自己的市民身份，希望能同这座城市互相尊重地相处，而对那些他称之为乡下土包子的人加在他身上的任何羞辱却非常记恨。","The narrative made Mr. Kernan indignant.He was keenly conscious of his citizenship, wished to live with his city on terms mutually honourable and resented any affront put upon him by those whom he called country bumpkins."
"“我们纳税就是为了这个吗？”他问，“为了供这些无知的软骨头们吃穿……他们还能是什么别的东西。”","“Is this what we pay rates for?” he asked.“To feed and clothe these ignorant bostooms... and they’re nothing else.”"
"坎宁安先生大笑起来。他只有在工作时间才是一位城堡官员。","Mr. Cunningham laughed.He was a Castle official only during office hours."
"“他们怎么可能会是别的什么东西呢，汤姆？”他说。","“How could they be anything else, Tom?” he said."
"他换上了一种浓厚的外省口音，以一种命令的腔调说道：","He assumed a thick, provincial accent and said in a tone of command:"
"“65，接住你的白菜！”","“65, catch your cabbage!”"
"所有的人都大笑起来。麦克伊先生想得空加入到谈话当中，便假装说他从来没有听过这个故事。坎宁安先生说：","Everyone laughed.Mr. M’Coy, who wanted to enter the conversation by any door, pretended that he had never heard the story.Mr. Cunningham said:"
"“故事应该是——他们说的，你要知道——发生在新兵站，在那里他们把这些块头很大的乡下人，一帮蠢人，你要知道，集中到一起进行训练。队长让他们端着盘子靠墙站成一排。”","“It is supposed—they say, you know—to take place in the depot where they get these thundering big country fellows, omadhauns, you know, to drill.The sergeant makes them stand in a row against the wall and hold up their plates.”"
"他用奇怪的手势描述着这个故事。","He illustrated the story by grotesque gestures."
"“吃晚饭的时候，你知道吧。他面前的桌子上放着超大一碗白菜，还有一个像一把铁锹似的超大饭勺。他用勺子舀了一团白菜，然后把它甩向了房间的另一头，那些可怜的家伙们不得不设法用盘子去接：65，接住你的白菜。”","“At dinner, you know.Then he has a bloody big bowl of cabbage before him on the table and a bloody big spoon like a shovel.He takes up a wad of cabbage on the spoon and pegs it across the room and the poor devils have to try and catch it on their plates: 65, catch your cabbage.”"
"大家又都笑了起来：但是克南先生却依然有些愤愤不平。他提到他要给报纸写一封信。","Everyone laughed again: but Mr. Kernan was somewhat indignant still.He talked of writing a letter to the papers."
"“这些野蛮人跑到这儿来，”他说，“觉得他们可以把人们差来遣去。马丁，我不用告诉你他们是些什么人吧。”","“These yahoos coming up here,” he said, “think they can boss the people.I needn’t tell you, Martin, what kind of men they are.”"
"坎宁安先生有所保留地表示了同意。","Mr. Cunningham gave a qualified assent."
"“这就像这个世界上的其他一切事情一样。”他说，“你能碰上坏的也能碰上好的。”","“It’s like everything else in this world,” he said.“You get some bad ones and you get some good ones.”"
"“啊，是啊，你碰上了些好的，我承认，”克南先生满意地说。","“O yes, you get some good ones, I admit,” said Mr. Kernan, satisfied."
"“最好是什么也不要跟他们说，”麦克伊先生说，“这是我的看法！”","“It’s better to have nothing to say to them,” said Mr. M’Coy.“That’s my opinion!”"
"克南太太走进房间，把一只盘子放在桌子上，说道：","Mrs. Kernan entered the room and, placing a tray on the table, said:"
"“请随意，先生们。”","“Help yourselves, gentlemen.”"
"鲍尔先生起身尽宾主之宜，要把自己的椅子让给她。她谢绝了，说自己正在楼下熨衣服，在和鲍尔先生身后的坎宁安先生互相点头致意之后，她准备离开房间。她的丈夫却冲她喊叫道：","Mr. Power stood up to officiate, offering her his chair.She declined it, saying she was ironing downstairs, and, after having exchanged a nod with Mr. Cunningham behind Mr. Power’s back, prepared to leave the room.Her husband called out to her:"
"“你什么都没为我准备吗，亲爱的？”","“And have you nothing for me, duckie?”"
"“哦，你呀！给你我的手背！”克南太太尖刻地说。","“O, you!The back of my hand to you!” said Mrs. Kernan tartly."
"她的丈夫在她身后叫道：","Her husband called after her:"
"“什么都不给可怜的小丈夫呀！”","“Nothing for poor little hubby!”"
"他摆出一副滑稽可笑的嘴脸和腔调，使得大家在分那几瓶黑啤酒时一片欢声笑语。","He assumed such a comical face and voice that the distribution of the bottles of stout took place amid general merriment."
"先生们就着酒杯喝了酒，把杯子放回到桌子上，接着停顿了片刻。然后坎宁安先生转向鲍尔先生很随意地说道：","The gentlemen drank from their glasses, set the glasses again on the table and paused.Then Mr. Cunningham turned towards Mr. Power and said casually:"
"“你说的是在星期四晚上，杰克。”","“On Thursday night, you said, Jack.”"
"“星期四，对的。”鲍尔先生说。","“Thursday, yes,” said Mr. Power."
"“行！”坎宁安先生干脆地说。","“Righto!” said Mr. Cunningham promptly."
"“我们可以在麦奥利酒吧碰面，”麦克伊先生说，“那是最方便的地方。”","“We can meet in M‘Auley’s,” said Mr. M’Coy.“That’ll be the most convenient place.”"
"“不过咱们可不许迟到，”鲍尔先生认真地说，“因为门口肯定会挤满了人。”","“But we mustn’t be late,” said Mr. Power earnestly, “because it is sure to be crammed to the doors.”"
"“咱们可以在七点半碰面。”麦克伊先生说。","“We can meet at half-seven,” said Mr. M’Coy."
"“行！”坎宁安先生说。","“Righto!” said Mr. Cunningham."
"“那就说定了，七点半在麦奥利酒吧！”","“Half-seven at M’Auley’s be it!”"
"一阵短暂的沉默。克南先生等着看朋友们是否会告诉他这是怎么回事。然后他问：","There was a short silence.Mr. Kernan waited to see whether he would be taken into his friends’ confidence.Then he asked:"
"“要干什么啊？”","“What’s in the wind?”"
"“哦，没什么，”坎宁安先生说，“只是我们安排在星期四要去做的一件小事儿。”","“O, it’s nothing,” said Mr. Cunningham.“It’s only a little matter that we’re arranging about for Thursday.”"
"“歌剧，是吗？”克南先生说。","“The opera, is it?” said Mr. Kernan."
"“不，不，”坎宁安先生躲躲闪闪地说道，“只是宗教方面的……一件小事。”","“No, no,” said Mr. Cunningham in an evasive tone, “it’s just a little... spiritual matter.”"
"“哦。”克南先生说。","“O,” said Mr. Kernan."
"又是一阵沉默。然后鲍尔先生直截了当地说道：","There was silence again.Then Mr. Power said, point blank:"
"“告诉你实话吧，汤姆，我们要去做一次静修。”","“To tell you the truth, Tom, we’re going to make a retreat.”"
"“是的，就是这样，”坎宁安先生说，“杰克和我还有麦克伊 —— 我们都要去洗心革面了。”","“Yes, that’s it,” said Mr. Cunningham, “Jack and I and M‘Coy here—we’re all going to wash the pot.”"
"他带着一种令人安心的力量打了这个比方，而且在自己声音的鼓励下，又接着说道：","He uttered the metaphor with a certain homely energy and, encouraged by his own voice, proceeded:"
"“你看，我们倒不妨承认我们是一帮出色的无赖，全都是。我说呀，全都是，”他带着粗鲁的善意补充道，然后转向了鲍尔先生，“现在就承认吧!”","“You see, we may as well all admit we’re a nice collection of scoundrels, one and all.I say, one and all,” he added with gruff charity and turning to Mr. Power.“Own up now!”"
"“我承认。”鲍尔先生说。","“I own up,” said Mr. Power."
"“我也承认。”麦克伊先生说。","“And I own up,” said Mr. M’Coy."
"“所以我们要一起去洗心革面。”坎宁安先生说。","“So we’re going to wash the pot together,” said Mr. Cunningham."
"他似乎突然想到了一个念头。他突然转向病人说道：","A thought seemed to strike him.He turned suddenly to the invalid and said:"
"“汤姆，你知道刚刚我想到什么了吗？你或许可以加入，那我们就能来段四人联手的里尔舞了。”","“D’ye know what, Tom, has just occurred to me?You might join in and we’d have a four-handed reel.”"
"“好主意，”鲍尔先生说，“我们四个人一起。”","“Good idea,” said Mr. Power.“The four of us together.”"
"克南先生沉默不语。这个提议几乎没有给他的脑子带来什么触动，不过，因为心里清楚一些宗教机构马上就要费心替他行事了，所以他觉得为了自己的尊严也要表示一下绝不低头的态度。他有好一会儿没有参与谈话，但他在听着，压抑着他的抵触情绪，而他的朋友们则在探讨耶稣会会士。","Mr. Kernan was silent.The proposal conveyed very little meaning to his mind, but, understanding that some spiritual agencies were about to concern themselves on his behalf, he thought he owed it to his dignity to show a stiff neck.He took no part in the conversation for a long while, but listened, with an air of calm enmity, while his friends discussed the Jesuits."
"“我对耶稣会会士没有这种坏印象。”他终于插嘴说道，“他们是受过教育的一派。我相信他们也都是出于好心。”","“I haven’t such a bad opinion of the Jesuits,” he said, intervening at length.“They’re an educated order.I believe they mean well, too.”"
"“他们是教会中最伟大的一派，汤姆，”坎宁安先生满怀激情地说道，“耶稣会会士长仅次于教皇。”","“They’re the grandest order in the Church, Tom,” said Mr. Cunningham, with enthusiasm.“The General of the Jesuits stands next to the Pope.”"
"“这一点不错，”麦克伊先生说，“如果你想要把一件事办好而且还干净利落的话，你就去找一个耶稣会会士。他们可都是有影响力的人。我来给你们讲一个这方面的例子……”","“There’s no mistake about it,” said Mr. M‘Coy, “if you want a thing well done and no flies about, you go to a Jesuit.They’re the boyos have influence.I’ll tell you a case in point....”"
"“耶稣会会士是一群优秀的人。”鲍尔先生说。","“The Jesuits are a fine body of men,” said Mr. Power."
"“有一件怪事，”坎宁安先生说，“是关于耶稣会的。教会的其他所有派别都会在某个时候不得不进行改革，但耶稣会却一次都没有改革过。它从来都没有衰退过。”","“It’s a curious thing,” said Mr. Cunningham, “about the Jesuit Order.Every other order of the Church had to be reformed at some time or other but the Jesuit Order was never once reformed.It never fell away.”"
"“真是这样吗？”麦克伊先生说。","“Is that so?” asked Mr. M’Coy."
"“这是个事实，”坎宁安先生说，“这是历史。”","“That’s a fact,” said Mr. Cunningham.“That’s history.”"
"“再看看他们的教堂，”鲍尔先生说，“看看他们拥有的会众。”","“Look at their church, too,” said Mr. Power.“Look at the congregation they have.”"
"“耶稣会会士是迎合上流阶层口味的。”麦克伊先生说。","“The Jesuits cater for the upper classes,” said Mr. M’Coy."
"“那当然了。”鲍尔先生说。","“Of course,” said Mr. Power."
"“没错，”克南先生说，“这就是为什么我对他们有好感的原因。是有些世俗神父，无知，自负——”","“Yes,” said Mr. Kernan.“That’s why I have a feeling for them.It’s some of those secular priests, ignorant, bumptious——”"
"“他们都是好人，”坎宁安先生说，“每个人都有自己的方式罢了。爱尔兰的神职人员在全世界都是受人尊敬的。”","“They’re all good men,” said Mr. Cunningham, “each in his own way. The Irish priesthood is honoured all the world over.”"
"“哦，是的。”鲍尔先生说。","“O yes,” said Mr. Power."
"“不像大陆上有些神职人员，”麦克伊先生说，“名不副实。”","“Not like some of the other priesthoods on the continent,” said Mr. M’Coy, “unworthy of the name.”"
"“或许你是对的。”克南先生说，态度缓和了些。","“Perhaps you’re right,” said Mr. Kernan, relenting."
"“我当然是对的，”坎宁安先生说，“我到过世界各地，见识过了人世的很多面，每每都要品评人的性格呢。”","“Of course I’m right,” said Mr. Cunningham.“I haven’t been in the world all this time and seen most sides of it without being a judge of character.”"
"先生们一个接着一个又开始喝起酒来。克南先生似乎在脑子里权衡着什么事情。他被触动了。他对坎宁安先生判断性格和察言观色的本领评价很高。他询问起细节来。","The gentlemen drank again, one following another’s example.Mr. Kernan seemed to be weighing something in his mind.He was impressed.He had a high opinion of Mr. Cunningham as a judge of character and as a reader of faces.He asked for particulars."
"“哦，它就是一次静修而已，你要知道，”坎宁安先生说，“珀登神父会来主持这次静修，它是针对商业人士的。”","“O, it’s just a retreat, you know,” said Mr. Cunningham.“Father Purdon is giving it. It’s for business men, you know.”"
"“他不会对我们过于严厉的，汤姆。”鲍尔先生诱劝道。","“He won’t be too hard on us, Tom,” said Mr. Power persuasively."
"“珀登神父？珀登神父？”病人说。","“Father Purdon?Father Purdon?” said the invalid."
"“哦，你肯定认识他，汤姆，”坎宁安先生肯定地说。“一个快乐的好人！他和我们一样也是个熟谙世事的人。”","“O, you must know him, Tom,” said Mr. Cunningham stoutly.“Fine, jolly fellow!He’s a man of the world like ourselves.”"
"“啊，……对。我想我认识他吧。脸很红；高个子。”","“Ah,... yes. I think I know him.Rather red face; tall.”"
"“就是那个人。”","“That’s the man.”"
"“那你告诉我，马丁……他是个不错的传道者吗？”","“And tell me, Martin.... Is he a good preacher?”"
"“嗯……我们参加的不是严格意义上的那种布道，你要知道。只是一种友好的谈话，就好似讲平常道理那样。”","“Munno.... It’s not exactly a sermon, you know.It’s just kind of a friendly talk, you know, in a common-sense way.”"
"克南先生仔细考虑着。麦克伊先生说：","Mr. Kernan deliberated.Mr. M’Coy said:"
"“汤姆·伯克神父，他才是合适的人选！”","“Father Tom Burke, that was the boy!”"
"“哦，汤姆·伯克神父，”坎宁安先生说，“那可是个天生的雄辩家。你听他讲过道吗，汤姆？”","“O, Father Tom Burke,” said Mr. Cunningham, “that was a born orator.Did you ever hear him, Tom?”"
"“我听他讲过道吗！”病人说道，他被激怒了，“是的！我听过他……”","“Did I ever hear him!” said the invalid, nettled.“Rather! I heard him....”"
"“不过据说他不算是一个真正的神学家 。”坎宁安先生说。","“And yet they say he wasn’t much of a theologian,” said Mr Cunningham."
"“真是那样吗？”麦克伊先生说。","“Is that so?” said Mr. M’Coy."
"“哦，当然了，错不了，你要知道。只是因为有时候，他们说，他不会宣讲非常正统的教义。”","“O, of course, nothing wrong, you know.Only sometimes, they say, he didn’t preach what was quite orthodox.”"
"“啊！……他是一个杰出的人。”麦克伊先生说。","“Ah!...he was a splendid man,” said Mr. M’Coy."
"“我听他讲过一次，”克南先生继续说道，“我现在忘了他那次宣讲的主题了。克罗夫顿和我当时坐在后面……正厅的后面，你知道吧……也就是——”","“I heard him once,” Mr. Kernan continued.“I forget the subject of his discourse now.Crofton and I were in the back of the... pit, you know... the——”"
"“中殿，”坎宁安先生说。","“The body,” said Mr. Cunningham."
"“对，就是在后面靠近门口的地方。我现在忘了……哦，对了，是关于教皇的，已故的教皇。我记得很清楚。我敢说那真是气势磅礴，那雄辩的演讲风格。还有他的声音！上帝！他怎么会有那么动听的声音！梵蒂冈的囚犯，他是这么叫他的。我记得我们出来的时候克罗夫顿对我说——”","“Yes, in the back near the door.I forget now what.... O yes, it was on the Pope, the late Pope.I remember it well.Upon my word it was magnificent, the style of the oratory.And his voice!God! hadn’t he a voice!The Prisoner of the Vatican, he called him.I remember Crofton saying to me when we came out——”"
"“不过他是个奥瑞治人，那个克罗夫顿，不是吗？”鲍尔先生说。","“But he’s an Orangeman, Crofton, isn’t he?” said Mr. Power."
"“当然他是，”克南先生说，“而且还是一个非常正派的奥瑞治人。我们去了穆尔街上的巴特勒酒吧——天啊，真正地被感动了，跟你们说大实话吧——我清楚地记得他说的每个词。克南，他说，我们在不同的圣坛上进行祭拜，他说，可是我们的信仰却是一样的。这话说的让我觉得非常好。”","“’Course he is,” said Mr. Kernan, “and a damned decent Orangeman too. We went into Butler’s in Moore Street—faith, was genuinely moved, tell you the God’s truth—and I remember well his very words.Kernan, he said, we worship at different altars, he said, but our belief is the same.Struck me as very well put.”"
"“这话很有道理，”鲍尔先生说，“汤姆神父过去布道的教堂一度总是挤满了新教徒。”","“There’s a good deal in that,” said Mr. Power.“There used always be crowds of Protestants in the chapel where Father Tom was preaching.”"
"“那我们之间没有太大的区别啊。”麦克伊先生说。","“There’s not much difference between us,” said Mr. M’Coy."
"“我们都相信——”","“We both believe in——”"
"他犹豫了片刻。","He hesitated for a moment."
"“……相信救世主。只是他们不相信教皇和圣母。”","“... in the Redeemer.Only they don’t believe in the Pope and in the mother of God.”"
"“不过，当然了，”坎宁安先生平静而有力地说，“我们的宗教才是宗教，是古老、本初的信仰。”","“But, of course,” said Mr. Cunningham quietly and effectively, “our religion is the religion, the old, original faith.”"
"“这一点毫无疑问。”克南先生热情地说道。","“Not a doubt of it,” said Mr. Kernan warmly."
"克南太太来到卧室门口通报说：","Mrs. Kernan came to the door of the bedroom and announced:"
"“有客人来拜访你！”","“Here’s a visitor for you!”"
"“是谁？”","“Who is it?”"
"“福格蒂先生。”","“Mr. Fogarty.”"
"“哦，进来！进来！”","“O, come in!come in!”"
"一张面色苍白的椭圆形脸出现在光亮处。脸上的那撇浅色小胡子的末梢弯卷着，闪现着喜悦和惊讶神情的眼睛上方，也有一对弯弯的浅色眉毛。福格蒂先生是一个中等收入的杂货商。他在城里经营过一家有执照的酒吧，但生意失败了，因为他的财力状况所限，他只能和二流的酒厂和酿酒商打交道。他在格拉斯奈文路上开了一家小店铺，在那里他满以为他的翩翩风度会让那个地区的家庭主妇们喜欢上他。他自持颇有几分优雅，对小孩子总是褒扬夸奖，说话也总是清楚利落。他并非没有教养。","A pale, oval face came forward into the light.The arch of its fair trailing moustache was repeated in the fair eyebrows looped above pleasantly astonished eyes.Mr. Fogarty was a modest grocer.He had failed in business in a licensed house in the city because his financial condition had constrained him to tie himself to second-class distillers and brewers.He had opened a small shop on Glasnevin Road where, he flattered himself, his manners would ingratiate him with the housewives of the district.He bore himself with a certain grace, complimented little children and spoke with a neat enunciation.He was not without culture."
"福格蒂先生给他带来了一件礼物，一瓶半品脱的特制威士忌。他先礼貌地询问了克南先生的病情，在把礼物放在桌子上后，他平等地和这一帮朋友坐在了一起。克南先生想起他和福格蒂先生之间还有一小笔杂货帐没有结清，因此他更加感激这份礼物。他说：","Mr. Fogarty brought a gift with him, a half-pint of special whisky.He inquired politely for Mr. Kernan, placed his gift on the table and sat down with the company on equal terms.Mr. Kernan appreciated the gift all the more since he was aware that there was a small account for groceries unsettled between him and Mr. Fogarty.He said:"
"“我不会怀疑你，老伙计。把这个打开，杰克，可以吗？”","“I wouldn’t doubt you, old man.Open that, Jack, will you?”"
"鲍尔先生又再次承担了重任。杯子清洗以后，倒好了五份威士忌。这种新的参与因素活跃了谈话气氛。福格蒂先生坐在椅子上的一小块地方，显得特别有兴趣。","Mr. Power again officiated.Glasses were rinsed and five small measures of whisky were poured out.This new influence enlivened the conversation.Mr. Fogarty, sitting on a small area of the chair, was specially interested."
"“教皇利奥十三，”坎宁安先生说，“是那个时代的一盏明灯。要知道，他的伟大思想，是要把拉丁教会和希腊教会结合起来。那是他的终生目标。”","“Pope Leo XIII,” said Mr. Cunningham, “was one of the lights of the age.His great idea, you know, was the union of the Latin and Greek Churches.That was the aim of his life.”"
"“我常听说他是欧洲最有智慧的一个人，”鲍尔先生说，“我的意思是，除了他是教皇这个原因之外。”","“I often heard he was one of the most intellectual men in Europe,” said Mr. Power.“I mean, apart from his being Pope.”"
"“他的确如此，”坎宁安先生说，“即使他不是最有智慧的那一个。他作为教皇的座右铭，你们要知道，是Lux upon Lux——光明之上的光明。”","“So he was,” said Mr. Cunningham, “if not the most so. His motto, you know, as Pope, was Lux upon Lux—Light upon Light.”"
"“不，不，”福格蒂先生着急地说，“我认为这一点你弄错了。是Lux in Tenebris，我认为 —— 黑暗之中的光明。”","“No, no,” said Mr. Fogarty eagerly.“I think you’re wrong there.It was Lux in Tenebris, I think—Light in Darkness.”"
"“哦，对，”麦克伊先生说，“是Tenebrae。”","“O yes,” said Mr. M’Coy, “Tenebrae.”"
"“听我说，”坎宁安先生肯定地说，“它是Lux upon Lux。另外他的前任，庇护九世的座右铭是Crux upon Crux——意思是，十字架之上的十字架——他们两者之间的区别就在这儿。”","“Allow me,” said Mr. Cunningham positively, “it was Lux upon Lux.And Pius IX his predecessor’s motto was Crux upon Crux—that is, Cross upon Cross—to show the difference between their two pontificates.”"
"这种推论得到了认可。坎宁安先生接着往下说：","The inference was allowed.Mr. Cunningham continued."
"“教皇利奥，你们要知道，是一个伟大的学者兼诗人。”","“Pope Leo, you know, was a great scholar and a poet.”"
"“他有一副坚毅的面孔。”克南先生说。","“He had a strong face,” said Mr. Kernan."
"“是的，”坎宁安先生说，“他写过拉丁文诗歌。”","“Yes,” said Mr. Cunningham.“He wrote Latin poetry.”"
"“真是那样吗？”福格蒂先生说。","“Is that so?” said Mr. Fogarty."
"麦克伊先生惬意地品尝着自己那杯威士忌，带着一种双重意图摇了摇头，说道：","Mr. M’Coy tasted his whisky contentedly and shook his head with a double intention, saying:"
"“这可不是开玩笑，我可以告诉你们。”","“That’s no joke, I can tell you.”"
"“我们都没学过这个，汤姆，”鲍尔先生仿效着麦克伊先生的样子说道，“我们当年上的可是那种一周一便士的学校。”","“We didn’t learn that, Tom,” said Mr. Power, following Mr. M’Coy’s example, “when we went to the penny-a-week school.”"
"“有许多人上的都是这种一周一便士的学校，每个人胳膊下面都得夹块泥炭，”克南先生简洁地说道。“过去的体制是最好的：非常诚实的教育。没有一样你们现代那些虚有其表的东西……”","“There was many a good man went to the penny-a-week school with a sod of turf under his oxter,” said Mr. Kernan sententiously.“The old system was the best: plain honest education.None of your modern trumpery....”"
"“非常正确。”鲍尔先生说。","“Quite right,” said Mr. Power."
"“没有多余的东西。”福格蒂先生说道。","“No superfluities,” said Mr. Fogarty."
"他阐明了这一论点之后就郑重地喝起酒来。","He enunciated the word and then drank gravely."
"“我记得曾经读到过，”坎宁安先生说，“教皇利奥一首关于照相术的发明的诗——当然，是用拉丁文写的。”","“I remember reading,” said Mr. Cunningham, “that one of Pope Leo’s poems was on the invention of the photograph—in Latin, of course.”"
"“关于照相术！”克南先生惊叫道。","“On the photograph!” exclaimed Mr. Kernan."
"“是的。”坎宁安先生说。","“Yes,” said Mr. Cunningham."
"他也从自己的酒杯里喝了口酒。","He also drank from his glass."
"“哎，你们要知道，”麦克伊先生说，“当你们想到照相术的时候，难道不觉得它奇妙吗？”","“Well, you know,” said Mr. M’Coy, “isn’t the photograph wonderful when you come to think of it?”"
"“哦，当然了，”鲍尔先生说，“大智慧者能够洞悉世事。”","“O, of course,” said Mr. Power, “great minds can see things.”"
"“正如诗人所说：大智慧者离疯狂近在咫尺。”福格蒂先生说。","“As the poet says: Great minds are very near to madness,” said Mr. Fogarty."
"克南先生似乎心里有些烦乱。他努力回想着新教神学中有些棘手的问题，最后他冲坎宁安先生说起话来。","Mr. Kernan seemed to be troubled in mind.He made an effort to recall the Protestant theology on some thorny points and in the end addressed Mr. Cunningham."
"“告诉我，马丁。”他说，“有些教皇 —— 当然了，不是说我们现在这位，或者他的前任，而是说过去的有些教皇 —— 不是确切地指谁……你知道吧……难道不是不太够格吗？”","“Tell me, Martin,” he said.“Weren’t some of the popes—of course, not our present man, or his predecessor, but some of the old popes—not exactly... you know... up to the knocker?”"
"一阵沉默。坎宁安先生说：","There was a silence.Mr. Cunningham said:"
"“哦，当然了，有一些不太好的人选……不过令人惊讶的就是这一点。他们中的任何一个，即使是那个最大的酒鬼，那个最……彻头彻尾的流氓，他们中的任何一个都不曾在担任教皇职务期间宣讲过一句错误的信条。这难道不算是一件令人惊讶的事情吗？”","“O, of course, there were some bad lots... But the astonishing thing is this.Not one of them, not the biggest drunkard, not the most... out-and-out ruffian, not one of them ever preached ex cathedra a word of false doctrine.Now isn’t that an astonishing thing?”"
"“的确是。”克南先生说。","“That is,” said Mr. Kernan."
"“是的，因为在教皇任职的时候，”福格蒂先生解释道，“他阐述的教义都是绝无谬误的。”","“Yes, because when the Pope speaks ex cathedra,” Mr. Fogarty explained, “he is infallible.”"
"“是的。”坎宁安先生说。","“Yes,” said Mr. Cunningham."
"“哦，我知道教皇阐述教义绝无谬误这回事。我记得当时我还年轻……或者那是——？”","“O, I know about the infallibility of the Pope.I remember I was younger then.... Or was it that——?”"
"福格蒂先生打断了他。他拿起酒瓶给其他人都加了点酒。麦克伊先生看见酒不够再分一圈了，就借口说他那头一份还没有喝完。其他人则都在推让之下接受了。威士忌落到酒杯里发出的轻快乐声形成了一支令人惬意的幕间曲。","Mr. Fogarty interrupted.He took up the bottle and helped the others to a little more.Mr. M’Coy, seeing that there was not enough to go round, pleaded that he had not finished his first measure.The others accepted under protest.The light music of whisky falling into glasses made an agreeable interlude."
"“你刚才说什么来着，汤姆？”麦克伊先生问道。","“What’s that you were saying, Tom?” asked Mr. M’Coy."
"“教皇阐述教义的绝无谬误，”坎宁安先生说，“这可是整个教会历史上最伟大的一幕。”","“Papal infallibility,” said Mr. Cunningham, “that was the greatest scene in the whole history of the Church.”"
"“它是怎么来的，马丁？”鲍尔先生问。","“How was that, Martin?” asked Mr. Power."
"坎宁安先生举起两根粗手指。","Mr. Cunningham held up two thick fingers."
"“在由红衣主教和大主教还有主教们组成的天主教红衣主教团中，你们要知道，只有两个人提出反对意见，而其他人则全部赞成。全部与会人员除了那两位之外达成了一致意见。不行！他们不同意！”","“In the sacred college, you know, of cardinals and archbishops and bishops there were two men who held out against it while the others were all for it.The whole conclave except these two was unanimous.No! They wouldn’t have it!”"
"“哈！”麦克伊先生说。","“Ha!” said Mr. M’Coy."
"“他们两位中一位是一个德国红衣主教，名叫多林……或者是道林……或者——”","“And they were a German cardinal by the name of Dolling... or Dowling... or——”"
"“道林肯定不是德国人，这一点是可以肯定的的。”鲍尔先生大笑着说道。","“Dowling was no German, and that’s a sure five,” said Mr. Power, laughing."
"“好了，这位伟大的德国红衣主教，不管他名叫什么，是其中一位；而另一位是约翰·麦克黑尔。”","“Well, this great German cardinal, whatever his name was, was one; and the other was John MacHale.”"
"“什么？”克南先生叫道，“是那个蒂厄姆的约翰吗？”","“What?” cried Mr. Kernan.“Is it John of Tuam?”"
"“你确定是这样吗？”福格蒂先生将信将疑地问道，“我一直以为是某个意大利人或美国人呢。”","“Are you sure of that now?” asked Mr. Fogarty dubiously.“I thought it was some Italian or American.”"
"“蒂厄姆的约翰，”坎宁安先生重复道，“就是那第二个人。”","“John of Tuam,” repeated Mr. Cunningham, “was the man.”"
"他喝了点酒，其他先生都学着他的样子喝了酒。然后他接着说道：","He drank and the other gentlemen followed his lead.Then he resumed:"
"“在这一点上他们争论着，来自全球各地的所有红衣主教和主教还有大主教与这两个人斗得难解难分，直到最后教皇本人站起来宣布说教皇阐述教义绝无谬误是天主教会的一条教义。就在那一刻，此前一直在为反对这个提案争论来争论去的约翰·麦克黑尔却站起来用狮子般的声音喊道：‘教义！’”","“There they were at it, all the cardinals and bishops and archbishops from all the ends of the earth and these two fighting dog and devil until at last the Pope himself stood up and declared infallibility a dogma of the Church ex cathedra.On the very moment John MacHale, who had been arguing and arguing against it, stood up and shouted out with the voice of a lion: ‘Credo!’”"
"“我相信！”福格蒂先生说。","“I believe!” said Mr. Fogarty."
"“信条！”坎宁安先生说。“那表明了他所具有的信仰。他在教皇说话的那一刻臣服了。”","“Credo!” said Mr. Cunningham. “That showed the faith he had.He submitted the moment the Pope spoke.”"
"“那道林呢？”麦克伊先生问。","“And what about Dowling?” asked Mr. M’Coy."
"“那个德国红衣主教没有屈服。他离开了教会。”","“The German cardinal wouldn’t submit.He left the church.”"
"坎宁安先生的话语在他的这些听众的脑海中构建起了教会的高大形象。他那低沉沙哑的声音在传达信仰和臣服的信息时使他们感到极为激动。当克南太太擦干着双手走进房间的时候，她走进了神情严肃的一群人之中。她没有打破这种静默，而是弯身倚在了床脚的栏杆上。","Mr. Cunningham’s words had built up the vast image of the church in the minds of his hearers.His deep, raucous voice had thrilled them as it uttered the word of belief and submission.When Mrs. Kernan came into the room, drying her hands she came into a solemn company.She did not disturb the silence, but leaned over the rail at the foot of the bed."
"“我有一次见过约翰·麦克黑尔，”克南先生说，“只要我活着，我就绝不会忘记这件事。”","“I once saw John MacHale,” said Mr. Kernan, “and I’ll never forget it as long as I live.”"
"他转身面向妻子以寻求证实。","He turned towards his wife to be confirmed."
"“我常跟你提起这件事吧？”","“I often told you that?”"
"克南太太点点头。","Mrs. Kernan nodded."
"“那是在约翰·格雷爵士塑像的揭幕仪式上。埃德蒙·德怀尔·格雷在胡言乱语地发言，这时就来了这位老人家，满脸怒容的老伙计，双眼从浓密的眉毛下方注视着他。”","“It was at the unveiling of Sir John Gray’s statue.Edmund Dwyer Gray was speaking, blathering away, and here was this old fellow, crabbed-looking old chap, looking at him from under his bushy eyebrows.”"
"克南先生皱起了眉头，他像一头愤怒的公牛似的低下了头怒视着他的妻子。","Mr. Kernan knitted his brows and, lowering his head like an angry bull, glared at his wife."
"“上帝！”他惊叫道，脸上恢复了自然的神色，“我从没见过一个人会有那样一种目光。它俨然是在说：我已经彻底了解了你，我的孩子。他有着鹰隼般的目光。”","“God!” he exclaimed, resuming his natural face, “I never saw such an eye in a man’s head.It was as much as to say: I have you properly taped, my lad. He had an eye like a hawk.”"
"“格雷家没有一个成器的。”鲍尔先生说。","“None of the Grays was any good,” said Mr. Power."
"又是一阵停顿。鲍尔先生转向克南太太突然愉快地说道：","There was a pause again.Mr. Power turned to Mrs. Kernan and said with abrupt joviality:"
"“好了，克南太太，我们将让你的男人变成一个神圣虔诚而且敬畏上帝的好天主教徒。”","“Well, Mrs. Kernan, we’re going to make your man here a good holy pious and God-fearing Roman Catholic.”"
"他冲着这帮伙计们一并挥了挥手臂。","He swept his arm round the company inclusively."
"“我们会一起去做一次静修，坦白我们的罪孽——上帝知道我们非常需要这样做。”","“We’re all going to make a retreat together and confess our sins—and God knows we want it badly.”"
"“我不介意，”克南先生有点紧张地笑着说。","“I don’t mind,” said Mr. Kernan, smiling a little nervously."
"克南太太觉得明智一点的做法应是掩饰住自己内心的满意之情。于是她便说：","Mrs. Kernan thought it would be wiser to conceal her satisfaction.So she said:"
"“我真同情那个不得不听你们讲述的可怜的神父。”","“I pity the poor priest that has to listen to your tale.”"
"克南先生的表情变了。","Mr. Kernan’s expression changed."
"“如果他不喜欢的话，”他直率地说，“他可以……做一件别的什么事。我就想跟他说说我那点烦心事。我并不是多坏的一个人——”","“If he doesn’t like it,” he said bluntly, “he can... do the other thing.I’ll just tell him my little tale of woe.I’m not such a bad fellow——”"
"坎宁安先生迅速插进话来。","Mr. Cunningham intervened promptly."
"“我们全都会正式弃绝于魔鬼，”他说，“大家一起，但不会忘记他的诡计和花招。”","“We’ll all renounce the devil,” he said, “together, not forgetting his works and pomps.”"
"“到我身后去吧，撒旦！”福格蒂先生笑着看着其他人说道。","“Get behind me, Satan!” said Mr. Fogarty, laughing and looking at the others."
"鲍尔先生什么也没说。他感到自己完全掌控不了局面了。不过一种满意的表情还是闪现在他的脸上。","Mr. Power said nothing.He felt completely out-generalled.But a pleased expression flickered across his face."
"“我们所要做的，”坎宁安先生说，“就是双手举着点燃的蜡烛站着重申我们受洗时的誓言。”","“All we have to do,” said Mr. Cunningham, “is to stand up with lighted candles in our hands and renew our baptismal vows.”"
"“哦，别忘了蜡烛，汤姆，”麦克伊先生说，“无论你干什么。”","“O, don’t forget the candle, Tom,” said Mr. M’Coy, “whatever you do.”"
"“什么？”克南先生说，“我必须得有一支蜡烛吗？”","“What?” said Mr. Kernan.“Must I have a candle?”"
"“哦，是的。”坎宁安先生说。","“O yes,” said Mr. Cunningham."
"“不，全都见鬼去吧，”克南先生幡然醒悟地说道，“这已经是我的底线了。我可以完全符合要求地来做这件事儿。我可以做静修和忏悔，以及……所有那些事儿。不，全都见鬼去吧，我不要什么蜡烛！”","“No, damn it all,” said Mr. Kernan sensibly, “I draw the line there.I’ll do the job right enough.I’ll do the retreat business and confession, and... all that business.But... no candles!No, damn it all, I bar the candles!”"
"他带着滑稽的严肃表情摇了摇头。","He shook his head with farcical gravity."
"“你们听听！”他的妻子说。","“Listen to that!” said his wife."
"“我不要什么蜡烛，”克南先生说，他发现已经在自己的听众中间有了某种影响，就继续来回摇晃着他的脑袋。“我不要魔灯那档子把戏。”","“I bar the candles,” said Mr. Kernan, conscious of having created an effect on his audience and continuing to shake his head to and fro. “I bar the magic-lantern business.”"
"所有的人都尽情大笑起来。","Everyone laughed heartily."
"“现在你们可有了一位好天主教徒了！”他的妻子说。","“There’s a nice Catholic for you!” said his wife."
"“不要蜡烛！”克南先生执拗地重复道，“就这样！”","“No candles!” repeated Mr. Kernan obdurately.“That’s off!”"
"加德纳街上耶稣会教堂的耳堂几乎已经满了；可仍然有先生们隔不了一会儿就会从侧门进来，在平信徒修士的引导下，踮着脚尖沿通道走过去，找个位子坐下。先生们全都衣着得体，井然有序。教堂里的灯光落在偶尔会有花呢衣服点缀其间的黑衣白领的会众身上，落在灰暗斑驳的绿色大理石立柱上，也落在那些忧郁的背景画面上。先生们坐在长椅上，他们把长裤略微往膝盖以上提了提，把帽子也安放在了一边。他们身子很靠后地坐着，郑重地凝视着远处的一点光斑，那是悬挂在高高的祭坛前面的一盏红灯。","The transept of the Jesuit Church in Gardiner Street was almost full; and still at every moment gentlemen entered from the side door and, directed by the lay-brother, walked on tiptoe along the aisles until they found seating accommodation.The gentlemen were all well dressed and orderly.The light of the lamps of the church fell upon an assembly of black clothes and white collars, relieved here and there by tweeds, on dark mottled pillars of green marble and on lugubrious canvases.The gentlemen sat in the benches, having hitched their trousers slightly above their knees and laid their hats in security.They sat well back and gazed formally at the distant speck of red light which was suspended before the high altar."
"在布道坛附近的一排长椅上坐着坎宁安先生和克南先生。在后面的长椅上单独坐着麦克伊先生：在他后面的长椅上坐着鲍尔先生和福格蒂先生。麦克伊先生曾设法在其他几位的长椅上找个座位，但没能成功，当这一帮人以梅花形五点排列落座之后，他又曾想说几句逗笑的话，但也没能成功。那几句话未能引起很好的效果，于是他也就作罢了。就连他也察觉到了庄严的气氛，就连他也开始对宗教的鼓舞有所感应了。坎宁安先生低语着让克南先生注意放贷人哈福德先生和选民登记官兼市长选举策划人范宁先生。哈福德先生坐在稍远一些的座位上，而范宁先生则挨着一位新当选的市政顾问坐在布道坛下面。右边坐着老迈克尔·格兰姆斯，三家当铺的所有人，还有丹·霍根的侄子，他刚刚得到了在市政秘书办公室工作的差事。在远处前排长椅上坐着亨德里克先生，《自由民日报》的首席记者，还有可怜的奥卡罗尔，克南先生的一位老朋友，他一度是一位赫赫有名的商界人物。克南先生认出了那些熟悉的面孔，他开始感到越来越自在了。他的帽子（已经让妻子给补好了）安放在他的膝盖上。有一两回，他用一只手把衣袖拽下来，而另一只手则轻轻地牢牢地捏着帽檐。","In one of the benches near the pulpit sat Mr. Cunningham and Mr. Kernan.In the bench behind sat Mr. M‘Coy alone: and in the bench behind him sat Mr. Power and Mr. Fogarty.Mr. M’Coy had tried unsuccessfully to find a place in the bench with the others, and, when the party had settled down in the form of a quincunx, he had tried unsuccessfully to make comic remarks.As these had not been well received, he had desisted.Even he was sensible of the decorous atmosphere and even he began to respond to the religious stimulus.In a whisper, Mr. Cunningham drew Mr. Kernan’s attention to Mr. Harford, the moneylender, who sat some distance off, and to Mr. Fanning, the registration agent and mayor maker of the city, who was sitting immediately under the pulpit beside one of the newly elected councillors of the ward.To the right sat old Michael Grimes, the owner of three pawnbroker’s shops, and Dan Hogan’s nephew, who was up for the job in the Town Clerk’s office.Farther in front sat Mr. Hendrick, the chief reporter of The Freeman’s Journal, and poor O’Carroll, an old friend of Mr. Kernan’s, who had been at one time a considerable commercial figure.Gradually, as he recognised familiar faces, Mr. Kernan began to feel more at home.His hat, which had been rehabilitated by his wife, rested upon his knees.Once or twice he pulled down his cuffs with one hand while he held the brim of his hat lightly, but firmly, with the other hand."
"只见一个强壮有力的身影费力地走上布道坛，他上身披着一件白色的法衣。与此同时，会众们也都行动起来，他们拿出手帕，小心翼翼地跪在了上面。克南先生仿效着大伙儿的作法。那个神父的身影现在站立在布道坛上了，那顶着一张大红脸盘的身躯有三分之二显现在栏杆之上。","A powerful-looking figure, the upper part of which was draped with a white surplice, was observed to be struggling into the pulpit.Simultaneously the congregation unsettled, produced handkerchiefs and knelt upon them with care.Mr. Kernan followed the general example.The priest’s figure now stood upright in the pulpit, two-thirds of its bulk, crowned by a massive red face, appearing above the balustrade."
"珀登神父跪了下来，面朝着那点红色的光斑，双手遮面祷告了起来。过了一会儿，他把手从脸上拿开，然后站了起来。会众们也都站了起来，重新坐到了长椅上。克南先生又把帽子放回到膝盖上原先那个位置，然后向布道者呈现出一副聚精会神的面孔。布道者大幅度地用一种繁复的手势把法衣的两个宽大的袖子折了回去，慢慢地审视着那一张张面孔。然后他说：","Father Purdon knelt down, turned towards the red speck of light and, covering his face with his hands, prayed.After an interval, he uncovered his face and rose.The congregation rose also and settled again on its benches.Mr. Kernan restored his hat to its original position on his knee and presented an attentive face to the preacher.The preacher turned back each wide sleeve of his surplice with an elaborate large gesture and slowly surveyed the array of faces.Then he said:"
"“因为今世之子生来就比光明之子更加聪明。因此要借着不义之财结交朋友，这样到你死的时候，他们就可以接你到永恒的帐幕里去。”","“For the children of this world are wiser in their generation than the children of light.Wherefore make unto yourselves friends out of the mammon of iniquity so that when you die they may receive you into everlasting dwellings.”"
"珀登神父用洪亮坚定的声音诵念了这段经文。他说，这是圣经中最难进行合理解读的经文之一。这篇经文在粗心的信徒看来似乎与其他地方耶稣基督所宣扬的高尚道德不相符合。不过，他告诉他的听众说，这篇经文在他看来似乎特别适用于引导那些命里注定要过世俗生活但却又希望不像俗人那般生活的人。这是一篇适用于商人和职业人士的经文。耶稣基督对我们人性中的每一个角落都有着他神圣的了解，他了解，并非所有的人都受到感召要去过宗教生活，他了解，迄今为止，绝大多数人都仍被迫生活在尘世，而且在某种程度上，生活也仍是为了尘世：在这句话中，他有意要给他们一种劝告，他在他们面前把那些崇奉财神的人作为宗教生活的典范，而这些人本来是芸芸众生中对宗教事务最不感兴趣的人。","Father Purdon developed the text with resonant assurance.It was one of the most difficult texts in all the Scriptures, he said, to interpret properly.It was a text which might seem to the casual observer at variance with the lofty morality elsewhere preached by Jesus Christ.But, he told his hearers, the text had seemed to him specially adapted for the guidance of those whose lot it was to lead the life of the world and who yet wished to lead that life not in the manner of worldlings.It was a text for business men and professional men.Jesus Christ with His divine understanding of every cranny of our human nature, understood that all men were not called to the religious life, that by far the vast majority were forced to live in the world, and, to a certain extent, for the world: and in this sentence He designed to give them a word of counsel, setting before them as exemplars in the religious life those very worshippers of Mammon who were of all men the least solicitous in matters religious."
"他告诉他的听众们说，他这天晚上在那里目的不是为了威吓，也不是为了炫耀；而只是以一个尘世之人的身份来和自己的同类说说话。他来跟商人们说话，他会以一种公事公办的方式来和他们说话。如果他能作个比喻的话，他说，他就是他们精神上的会计；他希望他的每一个听众都能打开自己的账本，精神生活的账本，来看看他们和良心之间的账目是否计算得准确。","He told his hearers that he was there that evening for no terrifying, no extravagant purpose; but as a man of the world speaking to his fellow-men.He came to speak to business men and he would speak to them in a businesslike way. If he might use the metaphor, he said, he was their spiritual accountant; and he wished each and every one of his hearers to open his books, the books of his spiritual life, and see if they tallied accurately with conscience."
"耶稣基督并非是一个严厉的工头。他了解我们的小毛病，了解我们那委琐堕落的本性中的弱点，了解生活中的种种诱惑所在。我们可能碰上过，实际上我们都曾时不时地碰上，各自的种种诱惑：我们可能会有，实际上我们都有，各自的毛病。但是只有一件事，他说，他会要求他的听众们去做。那就是：要直率而果敢地面对上帝。如果他们的账目在各个方面都做到了吻合一致，那就说：","Jesus Christ was not a hard taskmaster.He understood our little failings, understood the weakness of our poor fallen nature, understood the temptations of this life.We might have had, we all had from time to time, our temptations: we might have, we all had, our failings.But one thing only, he said, he would ask of his hearers.And that was: to be straight and manly with God.If their accounts tallied in every point to say:"
"“好了，我已经核对过了我的账目。我发现一切都好。”","“Well, I have verified my accounts.I find all well.”"
"但如果，正如可能会发生的那样，有一些出入，那就承认实情，像个男子汉那样坦诚交待，就说：","But if, as might happen, there were some discrepancies, to admit the truth, to be frank and say like a man:"
"“好了，我已经审查过我的账目。我发现这一点不对，这一点也不对。不过，借助于上帝的恩典，我将改正这个和这个。我将校正我的账目。”","“Well, I have looked into my accounts.I find this wrong and this wrong.But, with God’s grace, I will rectify this and this.I will set right my accounts.”"
"第十五章 死者","CHAPTER 15 THE DEAD"
"莉莉，也就是看门人的女儿，忙得简直脚都不着地了。她刚刚才把一位先生领进一楼厨房后面的备膳室要帮着对方脱掉外套，客厅的门铃就又叮当叮当地响了起来，她只好沿着空荡荡的厅堂过道疾奔过去让另一位客人进来。幸好她不必去照顾那些女士。不过凯特小姐和朱莉娅小姐已经想到了这一点，把楼上的盥洗室变成了女士更衣室。凯特小姐和朱莉娅小姐正呆在那儿，闲聊、说笑、嘀咕着，她们前脚挨后脚地走到楼梯口，趴在扶手上往下瞧，朝着莉莉喊是谁来了。","LILY, the caretaker’s daughter, was literally run off her feet.Hardly had she brought one gentleman into the little pantry behind the office on the ground floor and helped him off with his overcoat than the wheezy hall-door bell clanged again and she had to scamper along the bare hallway to let in another guest.It was well for her she had not to attend to the ladies also.But Miss Kate and Miss Julia had thought of that and had converted the bathroom upstairs into a ladies’ dressing-room.Miss Kate and Miss Julia were there, gossiping and laughing and fussing, walking after each other to the head of the stairs, peering down over the banisters and calling down to Lily to ask her who had come."
"莫肯家小姐们的年度舞会总是一件大事。认识她们的每个人都会来参加，有家族成员，家族的老朋友，朱莉娅合唱团的成员，那些够了年岁的凯特的学生，甚至还会有玛丽·简的一些学生。年度舞会从未失败过。年复一年，在大家的记忆中，舞会都办得非常好；在他们的兄弟帕特死后，凯特和朱莉娅就离开了斯托尼·巴特街上的那栋房子，然后带上她们唯一的侄女玛丽·简一块住到了厄舍岛上的这栋黑暗荒凉的房子里，她们从住在一层的谷物商富勒姆先生手里租下了房子的上面一部分。那至少是整整三十年以前的事了。玛丽·简当年还是个身着童装的小女孩，如今则成了这个家庭的支柱，因为她在哈丁顿路上有一架风琴。她已经上完了音乐学院，每年都会在古音乐厅的楼上房间里举办学生音乐会。她的许多学生都来自金斯敦和达尔奇那条路上的富裕的家庭。她的姑妈们尽管都老了，但也都会尽自己的一份力。朱莉娅头发已经灰白，但她却依然是亚当和夏娃教堂里的领衔女高音，而凯特身体十分虚弱，已经不能到处走动，但也会在后屋那架老式方形钢琴上给初学者上音乐课。莉莉，也就是看门人的女儿，则给她们当女佣。尽管生活俭朴，但她们却尊崇一定要吃好的原则。一切都是最好的：带菱形骨头的牛里脊肉，三先令一磅的茶叶以及最好的瓶装黑啤酒。不过莉莉在履行这些差事的时候很少出错，因此她和她的三位女主人相处得都很好。她们总爱瞎操心，仅此而已。但是她们唯一无法容忍的事情就是遭到顶嘴。","It was always a great affair, the Misses Morkan’s annual dance.Everybody who knew them came to it, members of the family, old friends of the family, the members of Julia’s choir, any of Kate’s pupils that were grown up enough, and even some of Mary Jane’s pupils too.Never once had it fallen flat.For years and years it had gone off in splendid style, as long as anyone could remember; ever since Kate and Julia, after the death of their brother Pat, had left the house in Stoney Batter and taken Mary Jane, their only niece, to live with them in the dark, gaunt house on Usher’s Island, the upper part of which they had rented from Mr. Fulham, the corn-factor on the ground floor.That was a good thirty years ago if it was a day.Mary Jane, who was then a little girl in short clothes, was now the main prop of the household, for she had the organ in Haddington Road.She had been through the Academy and gave a pupils’ concert every year in the upper room of the Antient Concert Rooms.Many of her pupils belonged to the better-class families on the Kingstown and Dalkey line.Old as they were, her aunts also did their share.Julia, though she was quite grey, was still the leading soprano in Adam and Eve’s, and Kate, being too feeble to go about much, gave music lessons to beginners on the old square piano in the back room.Lily, the caretaker’s daughter, did housemaid’s work for them.Though their life was modest, they believed in eating well; the best of everything: diamond-bone sirloins, three-shilling tea and the best bottled stout.But Lily seldom made a mistake in the orders, so that she got on well with her three mistresses.They were fussy, that was all.But the only thing they would not stand was back answers."
"当然了，在这样一个夜晚，她们是有充分的理由来操心的。现在十点钟过去已经很长时间了，但还是没有看到加布里埃尔和他妻子的身影。另外她们还非常担心弗雷迪·马林斯会醉醺醺地现身。她们决不希望玛丽·简的任何一名学生看到他喝醉的样子；而且当他那个样子的时候，有时是很难管住他的。弗雷迪·马林斯总是来得很晚，不过她们却很好奇是什么耽搁了加布里埃尔，这使得她们俩每隔两分钟就会到楼梯扶手处问莉莉加布里埃尔或弗雷迪是否来了。","Of course, they had good reason to be fussy on such a night.And then it was long after ten o’clock and yet there was no sign of Gabriel and his wife.Besides they were dreadfully afraid that Freddy Malins might turn up screwed.They would not wish for worlds that any of Mary Jane’s pupils should see him under the influence; and when he was like that it was sometimes very hard to manage him.Freddy Malins always came late, but they wondered what could be keeping Gabriel: and that was what brought them every two minutes to the banisters to ask Lily had Gabriel or Freddy come."
"“哦，康罗伊先生，”在替加布里埃尔开门时莉莉对他说道，“凯特小姐和朱莉娅小姐还以为你永远都不来了呢。晚上好，康罗伊太太。”","“O, Mr. Conroy,” said Lily to Gabriel when she opened the door for him, “Miss Kate and Miss Julia thought you were never coming.Good-night, Mrs. Conroy.”"
"“我猜她们就是那样想的，”加布里埃尔说，“可是她们忘了我这位太太得需要三个小时来没完没了地更衣打扮。”","“I’ll engage they did,” said Gabriel, “but they forget that my wife here takes three mortal hours to dress herself.”"
"他站在脚垫上，把雪从他的高统套鞋上蹭下去，而莉莉则领着他的妻子来到楼梯脚，大声喊道：","He stood on the mat, scraping the snow from his goloshes, while Lily led his wife to the foot of the stairs and called out:"
"“凯特小姐，康罗伊太太来了。”","“Miss Kate, here’s Mrs. Conroy.”"
"凯特和朱莉娅立刻沿着黑暗的楼梯步履蹒跚地走了下来。两个人都吻了吻加布里埃尔的妻子，说她简直是活活地就不见了，还问加布里埃尔是不是和她一起来了。","Kate and Julia came toddling down the dark stairs at once.Both of them kissed Gabriel’s wife, said she must be perished alive, and asked was Gabriel with her."
"“我来了，就像邮件一样准确无误，凯特姨妈！上去吧。我随后就来。”加布里埃尔从黑暗处大声说道。","“Here I am as right as the mail, Aunt Kate!Go on up. I’ll follow,” called out Gabriel from the dark."
"他继续使劲刮蹭着他的脚，而那三位女士则说笑着上楼到了女士更衣室。一层薄雪落在他外套的肩上，仿佛披肩一般；他那高统套鞋的足尖部分也落着一层雪，仿佛是鞋头一样；外套的纽扣在穿过被雪冻硬的扣眼时发出了吱吱咯咯的声音，一种从外面带来的寒冷却芬芳的气息也从衣服的缝隙褶皱处散逸出来。","He continued scraping his feet vigorously while the three women went upstairs, laughing, to the ladies’ dressing-room.A light fringe of snow lay like a cape on the shoulders of his overcoat and like toecaps on the toes of his goloshes; and, as the buttons of his overcoat slipped with a squeaking noise through the snow-stiffened frieze, a cold, fragrant air from out-of-doors escaped from crevices and folds."
"“又下雪了吗，康罗伊先生？”莉莉问。","“Is it snowing again, Mr. Conroy?” asked Lily."
"她走在他前面进了备膳室以便帮着他脱掉外套。加布里埃尔听到她说出他姓氏的那三个音节后冲她笑了笑，还瞥了她一眼。她是一个身材苗条、还在成长的女孩，面色苍白，长着干草色的头发。备膳室里的汽灯让她看上去显得更加苍白。加布里埃尔在她还是个小孩子，老是坐在最下面的一级台阶上抱着一个破洋娃娃玩的时候就认识她了。","She had preceded him into the pantry to help him off with his overcoat.Gabriel smiled at the three syllables she had given his surname and glanced at her.She was a slim, growing girl, pale in complexion and with hay-coloured hair.The gas in the pantry made her look still paler.Gabriel had known her when she was a child and used to sit on the lowest step nursing a rag doll."
"“是呀，莉莉，”他回答说，“我觉得咱们会有一整夜的雪要下呢。”","“Yes, Lily,” he answered, “and I think we’re in for a night of it.”"
"他抬头看看备膳室的天花板，楼上的跺脚和曳步使得天花板一直在颤动，他听了一会儿钢琴声，然后瞥了一眼那个女孩，她正把他的外套仔细叠好放在架子的尽头。","He looked up at the pantry ceiling, which was shaking with the stamping and shuffling of feet on the floor above, listened for a moment to the piano and then glanced at the girl, who was folding his overcoat carefully at the end of a shelf."
"“告诉我，莉莉，”他用一种友好的语气说道，“你还在上学吗？”","“Tell me, Lily,” he said in a friendly tone, “do you still go to school?”"
"“哦，不，先生，”她回答道，“我今年往后就不上学了。”","“O no, sir,” she answered.“I’m done schooling this year and more.”"
"“哦，那么，”加布里埃尔欢快地说，“我想我们很快就会在某个好日子参加你和某位年轻人的婚礼了，对吧？”","“O, then,” said Gabriel gaily, “I suppose we’ll be going to your wedding one of these fine days with your young man, eh?”"
"女孩回过头瞥了他一眼，然后怀着极大的怨愤说道：","The girl glanced back at him over her shoulder and said with great bitterness:"
"“现在的男人们只会说好听的，还有就是从你身上占便宜。”","“The men that is now is only all palaver and what they can get out of you.”"
"加布里埃尔脸红了，仿佛自己犯了错似的，他没敢看她，把高统套鞋踢掉，然后用手套飞快地擦了擦自己的漆皮鞋。","Gabriel coloured, as if he felt he had made a mistake and, without looking at her, kicked off his goloshes and flicked actively with his muffler at his patent-leather shoes."
"他是一个身材敦实、个子较高的年轻人。他面颊的红润之色甚至向上蔓延到了额头处，在那儿分散成了几块浅浅的不规则红斑；他的脸刮得须发全无，擦拭过的眼镜片和明亮的金边镜框不停地闪着亮光，眼镜遮住了他那双清秀而躁动不安的眼睛。他那有光泽的黑发从中间分开，在耳朵后面梳成了一种长长的弧线型，帽子压痕处的头发略微弯曲着。","He was a stout, tallish young man. The high colour of his cheeks pushed upwards even to his forehead, where it scattered itself in a few formless patches of pale red; and on his hairless face there scintillated restlessly the polished lenses and the bright gilt rims of the glasses which screened his delicate and restless eyes.His glossy black hair was parted in the middle and brushed in a long curve behind his ears where it curled slightly beneath the groove left by his hat."
"在把鞋擦出光亮之后，他站起身来，向下拽了拽背心，使之紧贴在他圆胖的身体上。然后他迅速地从口袋里取出一枚硬币。","When he had flicked lustre into his shoes he stood up and pulled his waistcoat down more tightly on his plump body.Then he took a coin rapidly from his pocket."
"“哦，莉莉，”他一边说，一边把硬币塞到了她的手里，“现在是圣诞时节，对吧？只有……这么一点……”","“O Lily,” he said, thrusting it into her hands, “it’s Christmastime, isn’t it?Just... here’s a little....”"
"他迅速朝门口走去。","He walked rapidly towards the door."
"“哦，不，先生！”女孩边喊边追上了他。“真的，先生，这我不会要的。”","“O no, sir!” cried the girl, following him.“Really, sir, I wouldn’t take it.”"
"“圣诞时节！圣诞时节！”加布里埃尔一边说，一边几乎是小跑着上了楼梯，然后冲她不以为然地挥了挥手。","“Christmas-time!Christmas-time!” said Gabriel, almost trotting to the stairs and waving his hand to her in deprecation."
"女孩见他已经登上了楼梯，就在他身后大声说道：","The girl, seeing that he had gained the stairs, called out after him:"
"“好吧，谢谢您了，先生。”","“Well, thank you, sir.”"
"他在客厅门外等着，想等到那一支华尔兹舞曲结束，他听着裙子扫在门上的声音以及脚步的拖曳声。他仍然让那个女孩冷不防的强烈拒绝搞得有些心慌意乱。这使他显得有些沮丧，他整了整袖口和领结，想以此来设法驱走这种沮丧的情绪。他从背心口袋里取出一小片纸，扫视了一下他为自己的演讲准备的提纲。他还没拿定主意要不要引用罗伯特·勃朗宁的那几句诗，因为他担心这些诗句会超出听众的理解力。从莎士比亚或者《歌谣集》中引用某些他们知道的句子会更好些。男人们的鞋跟发出的很不文雅的咔哒声以及他们的鞋底拖曳在地上的声音都在提醒他，他们的文化程度和他的是不一样的。要是给他们引用他们无法理解的诗歌，只会让自己显得荒唐可笑。他们会觉得他是在炫耀自己接受过的优等教育。他会在他们面前败兴的，正如在备膳室里他在那个女孩面前败兴一样。他选定了一种错误的调子。他的整篇演讲词从头到尾就是一个错误，一个彻头彻尾的败兴之作。","He waited outside the drawing-room door until the waltz should finish, listening to the skirts that swept against it and to the shuffling of feet.He was still discomposed by the girl’s bitter and sudden retort.It had cast a gloom over him which he tried to dispel by arranging his cuffs and the bows of his tie.He then took from his waistcoat pocket a little paper and glanced at the headings he had made for his speech.He was undecided about the lines from Robert Browning, for he feared they would be above the heads of his hearers.Some quotation that they would recognise from Shakespeare or from the Melodies would be better.The indelicate clacking of the men’s heels and the shuffling of their soles reminded him that their grade of culture differed from his.He would only make himself ridiculous by quoting poetry to them which they could not understand.They would think that he was airing his superior education.He would fail with them just as he had failed with the girl in the pantry.He had taken up a wrong tone.His whole speech was a mistake from first to last, an utter failure."
"就在那时他的姨妈们和他的妻子从女士更衣室里走了出来。他的姨妈们是两个身材矮小、衣着朴素的老女人。朱莉娅姨妈大概要稍高一英寸。她的头发搭垂在耳朵上边，颜色灰白；同样灰白且带着更暗色调的是她那张肌肉松垂的大脸。尽管她体格结实，站得笔直，但她那迟缓的眼神和张开的双唇使她看上去就像是一个不知自己身处何方或去往何处的女人。凯特姨妈则更有活力一些。她的脸色比姐姐的更健康些，脸上布满了皱纹和褶痕，就像是一个干缩了的红苹果，她的头发也同样梳成了老式的发辫，但还没有褪去那种熟栗子的颜色。","Just then his aunts and his wife came out of the ladies’ dressing-room.His aunts were two small, plainly dressed old women.Aunt Julia was an inch or so the taller.Her hair, drawn low over the tops of her ears, was grey; and grey also, with darker shadows, was her large flaccid face.Though she was stout in build and stood erect, her slow eyes and parted lips gave her the appearance of a woman who did not know where she was or where she was going.Aunt Kate was more vivacious.Her face, healthier than her sister’s, was all puckers and creases, like a shrivelled red apple, and her hair, braided in the same old-fashioned way, had not lost its ripe nut colour."
"她们都大大方方地吻了加布里埃尔。他是她们最喜欢的一个外甥，是她们已故的姐姐埃伦的儿子，埃伦当年嫁给了港务局的T. J. 康罗伊。","They both kissed Gabriel frankly.He was their favourite nephew the son of their dead elder sister, Ellen, who had married T. J. Conroy of the Port and Docks."
"“格雷塔告诉我说你们今天晚上不打算坐出租马车回芒克斯顿了，加布里埃尔。”凯特姨妈说。","“Gretta tells me you’re not going to take a cab back to Monkstown tonight, Gabriel,” said Aunt Kate."
"“不坐了，”加布里埃尔说着转向了他的妻子，“去年我们可是受够了，不是吗？你难道不记得了吗，凯特姨妈，格雷塔因为坐车得了一场那么严重的感冒？马车的窗户一路上都在哗哗作响，我们过了梅里安之后，东风就不停地往里灌。那一次旅行可真是愉快，害格雷塔患了一场可怕的感冒。”","“No,” said Gabriel, turning to his wife, “we had quite enough of that last year, hadn’t we?Don’t you remember, Aunt Kate, what a cold Gretta got out of it?Cab windows rattling all the way, and the east wind blowing in after we passed Merrion.Very jolly it was. Gretta caught a dreadful cold.”"
"凯特姨妈肃然皱着眉头，每听一个词她都点头。","Aunt Kate frowned severely and nodded her head at every word."
"“很对，加布里埃尔，很对，”她说，“再小心也不为过的。”","“Quite right, Gabriel, quite right,” she said.“You can’t be too careful.”"
"“不过就格雷塔来说，”加布里埃尔说，“只要没人拦着，她是能在雪地里走回家的。”","“But as for Gretta there,” said Gabriel, “she’d walk home in the snow if she were let.”"
"康罗伊太太大笑了起来。","Mrs. Conroy laughed."
"“别理他，凯特姨妈，”她说，“他可真是个十足的讨厌鬼，他让汤姆晚上戴太阳镜，还叫他举哑铃，逼着伊娃吃麦片粥。可怜的孩子！她光是看见就觉得讨厌！……哦，您可是永远都猜不出今晚他非要让我穿什么！”","“Don’t mind him, Aunt Kate,” she said.“He’s really an awful bother, what with green shades for Tom’s eyes at night and making him do the dumb-bells, and forcing Eva to eat the stirabout.The poor child!And she simply hates the sight of it!...O, but you’ll never guess what he makes me wear now!”"
"她爆发出一阵响亮的欢笑声，瞥了丈夫一眼，他那欣羡幸福的眼神正从她的裙子游移到她的脸庞和头发上。两位姨妈也开心地大笑着，因为加布里埃尔的瞎操心是她们一直以来的一个笑资。","She broke out into a peal of laughter and glanced at her husband, whose admiring and happy eyes had been wandering from her dress to her face and hair.The two aunts laughed heartily, too, for Gabriel’s solicitude was a standing joke with them."
"“高统套鞋！”康罗伊太太说，“这是最近的一次。每当地上湿乎乎的时候，我就必须得穿上我的高统套鞋。今晚就是，他又想让我穿上套鞋，可我不愿意。他下一样要给我买的东西肯定会是一套潜水服。”","“Goloshes!” said Mrs. Conroy.“That’s the latest.Whenever it’s wet underfoot I must put on my galoshes.Tonight even, he wanted me to put them on, but I wouldn’t.The next thing he’ll buy me will be a diving suit.”"
"加布里埃尔紧张不安地笑了，还寻求宽慰似的拍了拍他的领结，而凯特姨妈几乎笑弯了腰，她发自内心地被这个笑话逗乐了。笑容很快就从朱莉娅姨妈的脸上消失了，她那双失去笑意的眼睛盯着她外甥的脸。停顿了一会儿之后，她问道：","Gabriel laughed nervously and patted his tie reassuringly, while Aunt Kate nearly doubled herself, so heartily did she enjoy the joke.The smile soon faded from Aunt Julia’s face and her mirthless eyes were directed towards her nephew’s face.After a pause she asked:"
"“什么是高统套鞋，加布里埃尔？”","“And what are goloshes, Gabriel?”"
"“高统套鞋，朱莉娅！”她的妹妹惊呼道，“我的天哪，难道你不知道高统套鞋是什么东西吗？你要把高统套鞋穿在你的……你的靴子外面的，格雷塔，不是吗？”","“Goloshes, Julia!” exclaimed her sister. “Goodness me, don’t you know what goloshes are?You wear them over your... over your boots, Gretta, isn’t it?”"
"“是的，”康罗伊太太说，“胶木胶做的东西。　　　我们俩现在每人一双。加布里埃尔说大陆上人人都穿这种东西。”","“Yes,” said Mrs. Conroy.“Guttapercha things.We both have a pair now.Gabriel says everyone wears them on the Continent.”"
"“哦，大陆上。”朱莉娅姨妈咕哝着，慢慢点了点头。","“O, on the Continent,” murmured Aunt Julia, nodding her head slowly."
"加布里埃尔拧起了眉头，然后仿佛有点被触怒了似的说道：","Gabriel knitted his brows and said, as if he were slightly angered:"
"“不是什么特别神奇的东西，只是格雷塔觉得它非常有趣而已，因为她说这个词让她想起了黑人演唱团。”","“It’s nothing very wonderful, but Gretta thinks it very funny because she says the word reminds her of Christy Minstrels.”"
"“不过告诉我，加布里埃尔，”凯特姨妈反应敏捷地说。“当然，你们已经看过房间了。格雷塔刚刚还说……”","“But tell me, Gabriel,” said Aunt Kate, with brisk tact.“Of course, you’ve seen about the room.Gretta was saying...”"
"“哦，房间很不错，”加布里埃尔回答道，“我已经在格雷沙姆旅店订了一个房间。”","“O, the room is all right,” replied Gabriel.“I’ve taken one in the Gresham.”"
"“当然，”凯特姨妈说，“这就最好了。孩子们呢，格雷塔，你就不替他们担心吗？”","“To be sure,” said Aunt Kate, “by far the best thing to do. And the children, Gretta, you’re not anxious about them?”"
"“哦，只过一个晚上，”康罗伊太太说，“而且，贝西会照顾他们的。”","“O, for one night,” said Mrs. Conroy.“Besides, Bessie will look after them.”"
"“当然，”凯特姨妈又说，“有那样一个女孩真是件叫人宽心的事，一个靠得住的人！可是这个莉莉，真不知道最近是什么让她着魔了。她根本就不像是过去那个好女孩了。”","“To be sure,” said Aunt Kate again.“What a comfort it is to have a girl like that, one you can depend on!There’s that Lily, I’m sure I don’t know what has come over her lately.She’s not the girl she was at all.”"
"加布里埃尔正准备就这一点问姨妈几个问题，可她却突然停了下来，目光追随着她的姐姐，朱莉娅已经蹓跶到了楼梯上，正伸着脖子趴在扶手上张望着。","Gabriel was about to ask his aunt some questions on this point, but she broke off suddenly to gaze after her sister, who had wandered down the stairs and was craning her neck over the banisters."
"“怎么回事，”她几近恼火地说道，“朱莉娅要去哪儿？朱莉娅！朱莉娅！你要去哪儿？”","“Now, I ask you,” she said almost testily, “where is Julia going?Julia! Julia!Where are you going?”"
"朱莉娅已经走到了一段楼梯的一半那个地方，此时又返了回来，柔声细语地宣布道：","Julia, who had gone half way down one flight, came back and announced blandly:"
"“弗雷迪来了。”","“Here’s Freddy.”"
"与此同时，一阵鼓掌声以及钢琴演奏者弹奏的最后一个花音表明华尔兹舞曲结束了。客厅的门从里面打开了，几对舞伴走了出来。凯特姨妈赶忙把加布里埃尔拉到一边对着他的耳朵低语道：","At the same moment a clapping of hands and a final flourish of the pianist told that the waltz had ended.The drawing-room door was opened from within and some couples came out. Aunt Kate drew Gabriel aside hurriedly and whispered into his ear:"
"“你悄悄溜下去，加布里埃尔，好孩子，去看看他有事没有，要是他喝多了就不要让他上来。我敢肯定他是喝多了。我肯定他就是。”","“Slip down, Gabriel, like a good fellow and see if he’s all right, and don’t let him up if he’s screwed.I‘m sure he’s screwed.I’m sure he is.”"
"加布里埃尔走到楼梯边上，趴在扶手上听了听。他能听到有两个人正在备膳室里说话。然后他辨别出了弗雷迪·马林斯的笑声。他走下楼梯，弄出很大声响。","Gabriel went to the stairs and listened over the banisters.He could hear two persons talking in the pantry.Then he recognised Freddy Malins’ laugh.He went down the stairs noisily."
"“真是让人感到宽慰，”凯特姨妈对康罗伊太太说，“加布里埃尔在这儿。他在这儿的时候，我总会感到更轻松些……朱莉娅，戴利小姐和鲍尔小姐要来点饮料。谢谢你，戴利小姐，你弹得华尔兹舞曲真动听。它让大家很开心。”","“It’s such a relief,” said Aunt Kate to Mrs. Conroy, “that Gabriel is here.I always feel easier in my mind when he’s here.... Julia, there’s Miss Daly and Miss Power will take some refreshment.Thanks for your beautiful waltz, Miss Daly.It made lovely time.”"
"一个脸庞干瘪的高个子男人，留着一撮硬硬的花白胡子，肤色黝黑，他一边和他的舞伴往外走一边说道：","A tall wizen-faced man, with a stiff grizzled moustache and swarthy skin, who was passing out with his partner, said:"
"“我们也能来点饮料吗，莫肯小姐？”","“And may we have some refreshment, too, Miss Morkan?”"
"“朱莉娅，”凯特姨妈扼要地说道，“这是布朗先生和弗朗小姐。带他们进去，朱莉娅，跟戴利小姐和鲍尔小姐一起。”","“Julia,” said Aunt Kate summarily, “and here’s Mr. Browne and Miss Furlong.Take them in, Julia, with Miss Daly and Miss Power.”"
"“我可是女士们钟爱的男人，”布朗先生说着撅起嘴巴，连胡子都直立了起来，笑得满脸都是皱纹。“你知道吧，莫肯小姐，她们这么喜欢我的原因是——”","“I’m the man for the ladies,” said Mr. Browne, pursing his lips until his moustache bristled and smiling in all his wrinkles.“You know, Miss Morkan, the reason they are so fond of me is——”"
"他还没说完这句话，就看见凯特姨妈已经出了能听到他说话的范围，便立刻领着三位女士走进了后屋。屋子中央摆着两张并排放着的方桌，朱莉娅姨妈和看门人正在拉直铺平一块大桌布。餐具柜上排放着一些碟子盘子，还有玻璃酒杯和一捆捆刀叉汤匙。合上盖的方形钢琴的顶部也被用作了餐具柜，上面摆放着各种食品和糖果。在屋子一角一个小一点的餐具柜旁边站着两个年轻人，正在喝苦啤酒。","He did not finish his sentence, but, seeing that Aunt Kate was out of earshot, at once led the three young ladies into the back room.The middle of the room was occupied by two square tables placed end to end, and on these Aunt Julia and the caretaker were straightening and smoothing a large cloth.On the sideboard were arrayed dishes and plates, and glasses and bundles of knives and forks and spoons.The top of the closed square piano served also as a sideboard for viands and sweets.At a smaller sideboard in one corner two young men were standing, drinking hop-bitters."
"布朗先生领着他的照看对象们朝那边走过去，然后开玩笑地邀请她们全都喝点专门为女士制作的潘趣酒，味道又辣又浓还发甜。不过她们说她们从来都不喝烈性酒，他便给她们打开了三瓶柠檬汁。然后他叫一个年轻人让到一边，抓起那个细颈酒瓶给自己倒了满满一杯威士忌。他试着先呷了一口，那两个年轻人全都崇敬地看着他。","Mr. Browne led his charges thither and invited them all, in jest, to some ladies’ punch, hot, strong and sweet.As they said they never took anything strong, he opened three bottles of lemonade for them.Then he asked one of the young men to move aside, and, taking hold of the decanter, filled out for himself a goodly measure of whisky.The young men eyed him respectfully while he took a trial sip."
"“上帝保佑，”他笑着说道，“这可是医生的嘱咐。”","“God help me,” he said, smiling, “it’s the doctor’s orders.”"
"他那干瘪的脸绽开了更为灿烂的笑容，那三位年轻女士也因他这句玩笑话而发出了悦耳的笑声，她们的身体来回摇晃着，肩膀微微颤抖。最大胆的一位说道：","His wizened face broke into a broader smile, and the three young ladies laughed in musical echo to his pleasantry, swaying their bodies to and fro, with nervous jerks of their shoulders.The boldest said:"
"“哦，好了，布朗先生，我敢肯定医生从来都没有嘱咐过要喝这种东西。”","“O, now, Mr. Browne, I’m sure the doctor never ordered anything of the kind.”"
"布朗先生又喝了一口威士忌，然后前倾着身子带着模仿的语气说道：","Mr. Browne took another sip of his whisky and said, with sidling mimicry:"
"“呃，你看，我就像著名的卡西迪夫人，据称她曾这样说过：‘行了，玛丽·格莱姆斯，要是我不吃的话，要想法让我吃，因为我觉得我需要吃。’”","“Well, you see, I’m like the famous Mrs. Cassidy, who is reported to have said: ‘Now, Mary Grimes, if I don’t take it, make me take it, for I feel I want it.’”"
"他那发热的脸前倾得有些过于私密，另外他还用了一种非常低俗的都柏林口音，这使得几位年轻女士都本能地用沉默来回应他的话。弗朗小姐是玛丽·简的一名学生，她问戴利小姐刚才弹奏的那支好听的华尔兹舞曲的名称是什么；布朗先生见自己受了冷落便立刻转向了那两个更有欣赏力的年轻男子。","His hot face had leaned forward a little too confidentially and he had assumed a very low Dublin accent so that the young ladies, with one instinct, received his speech in silence.Miss Furlong, who was one of Mary Jane’s pupils, asked Miss Daly what was the name of the pretty waltz she had played; and Mr. Browne, seeing that he was ignored, turned promptly to the two young men who were more appreciative."
"一个脸庞红润、身着三色堇盛装的年轻女人走进房间，兴奋地拍着手喊道：","A red-faced young woman, dressed in pansy, came into the room, excitedly clapping her hands and crying:"
"“方阵舞！方阵舞！”","“Quadrilles!Quadrilles!”"
"凯特姨妈紧跟着她走了进来，喊道：","Close on her heels came Aunt Kate, crying:"
"“两位先生和三位女士，玛丽·简！”","“Two gentlemen and three ladies, Mary Jane!”"
"“哦，这是伯金先生和克里根先生，”玛丽·简说。“克里根先生，你愿意带鲍尔小姐吗？弗朗小姐，我可否把伯金先生安排给您作舞伴？啊，这下就正好了。”","“O, here’s Mr. Bergin and Mr. Kerrigan,” said Mary Jane.“Mr. Kerrigan, will you take Miss Power?Miss Furlong, may I get you a partner, Mr. Bergin.O, that’ll just do now.”"
"“三位女士呢，玛丽·简。”凯特姨妈说。","“Three ladies, Mary Jane,” said Aunt Kate."
"那两个年轻的绅士问女士们他们是否有此荣幸，玛丽·简转向了戴利小姐。","The two young gentlemen asked the ladies if they might have the pleasure, and Mary Jane turned to Miss Daly."
"“哦，戴利小姐，您实在是太好了，刚刚给大家弹奏了两支舞曲，可我们今晚确实是很缺女士。”","“O, Miss Daly, you‘re really awfully good, after playing for the last two dances, but really we’re so short of ladies tonight.”"
"“我一点儿都不介意，莫肯小姐。”","“I don’t mind in the least, Miss Morkan.”"
"“不过我有一个很不错的舞伴介绍给您，巴特尔·达西先生，那位男高音。稍后我会请他给大家演唱。整个都柏林都在热捧他。”","“But I’ve a nice partner for you, Mr. Bartell D’Arcy, the tenor.I’ll get him to sing later on. All Dublin is raving about him.”"
"“美妙的声音，美妙的声音！”凯特姨妈说。","“Lovely voice, lovely voice!” said Aunt Kate."
"钢琴已经弹了两次第一个舞阵的序曲，所以玛丽·简便领着她刚刚召集起来参加舞阵的人们迅速离开了房间。他们刚走，朱莉娅姨妈就漫步进了房间，边走边朝身后看着什么东西。","As the piano had twice begun the prelude to the first figure Mary Jane led her recruits quickly from the room.They had hardly gone when Aunt Julia wandered slowly into the room, looking behind her at something."
"“怎么了，朱莉娅？”凯特姨妈担心地问道，“那是谁？”","“What is the matter, Julia?” asked Aunt Kate anxiously.“Who is it?”"
"朱莉娅是拿着一沓餐巾纸进来的，这个问题仿佛把她吓了一跳，她转身面对她的妹妹简短地说道：","Julia, who was carrying in a column of table-napkins, turned to her sister and said, simply, as if the question had surprised her:"
"“是弗雷迪，凯特，加布里埃尔和他在一起。”","“It’s only Freddy, Kate, and Gabriel with him.”"
"实际上在她身后就能看见加布里埃尔正引领着弗雷迪·马林斯走过楼梯平台。后者是一个大约四十岁左右的年轻人，个头身材都和加布里埃尔相当，肩膀非常圆实。他的脸多肉而苍白，只有厚厚的耳垂和宽宽的鼻翼旁边才稍有点血色。他长着粗笨的五官，钝头鼻子，突起的额头上发际线很靠后，还有肿胀而突出的双唇。他那眼皮厚重的双眼和稀少而凌乱的头发都使他看上去睡意惺忪。他在楼梯上一直在给加布里埃尔讲什么事情，并且为此而开怀大笑，一边笑一边还用左拳的指节前后揉搓着左眼。","In fact right behind her Gabriel could be seen piloting Freddy Malins across the landing.The latter, a young man of about forty, was of Gabriel’s size and build, with very round shoulders.His face was fleshy and pallid, touched with colour only at the thick hanging lobes of his ears and at the wide wings of his nose.He had coarse features, a blunt nose, a convex and receding brow, tumid and protruded lips.His heavy-lidded eyes and the disorder of his scanty hair made him look sleepy.He was laughing heartily in a high key at a story which he had been telling Gabriel on the stairs and at the same time rubbing the knuckles of his left fist backwards and forwards into his left eye."
"“晚上好，弗雷迪。”朱莉娅姨妈说。","“Good-evening, Freddy,” said Aunt Julia."
"弗雷迪·马林斯向两位莫肯小姐也道了晚上好，但方式似乎很随意，因为他的嗓音里有一种习惯性的顿塞，他看见布朗先生正从餐具柜那边咧着嘴冲他笑，于是就迈开双腿摇摇晃晃地横穿房间走过去，然后又用一种压低了的声音开始重复他刚刚给加布里埃尔讲过的那个故事。","Freddy Malins bade the Misses Morkan good-evening in what seemed an offhand fashion by reason of the habitual catch in his voice and then, seeing that Mr. Browne was grinning at him from the sideboard, crossed the room on rather shaky legs and began to repeat in an undertone the story he had just told to Gabriel."
"“他还不算太糟，是吧？”凯特姨妈对加布里埃尔说。","“He’s not so bad, is he?” said Aunt Kate to Gabriel."
"加布里埃尔的眉头郁结着，但很快他就扬眉回答道：","Gabriel’s brows were dark but he raised them quickly and answered:"
"“哦，不糟，几乎看不出来。”","“O, no, hardly noticeable.”"
"“不过，他真是个可恶的家伙！”她说，“他那可怜的母亲让他在新年前夜发过誓的。不过，来吧，加布里埃尔，进客厅吧。”","“Now, isn’t he a terrible fellow!” she said.“And his poor mother made him take the pledge on New Year’s Eve.But come on, Gabriel, into the drawing-room.”"
"在和加布里埃尔离开房间之前，她皱起眉头来回摆动着一个食指向布朗先生发出警告。布朗先生点头作答，然后在她走了之后，冲着弗雷迪·马林斯说道：","Before leaving the room with Gabriel she signalled to Mr. Browne by frowning and shaking her forefinger in warning to and fro. Mr. Browne nodded in answer and, when she had gone, said to Freddy Malins:"
"“好了，这样，弗雷迪，让我给你倒满满一杯柠檬汁好让你精神起来。”","“Now, then, Teddy, I’m going to fill you out a good glass of lemonade just to buck you up.”"
"弗雷迪·马林斯马上就要讲到故事的高潮，便不耐烦地挥手拒绝了这个提议，不过布朗先生先是叫弗雷迪·马林斯注意他着装上有点儿不整，然后就倒了满满一杯柠檬汁递给他。弗雷迪·马林斯的左手机械地接过了杯子，而右手则机械地整了整衣服。布朗先生的脸由于高兴而再一次布满皱纹，他为自己倒了一杯威士忌，而弗雷迪·马林斯在他最后讲到故事的高潮部分之前就爆发出了一阵带喘气的尖声大笑，他把那杯一口还没喝、满得往外溢的柠檬汁放下，开始用左拳的指节前后揉擦起左眼来，一边笑着一边还在可能的情况下重复着最后一句话的那几个词。","Freddy Malins, who was nearing the climax of his story, waved the offer aside impatiently but Mr. Browne, having first called Freddy Malins’ attention to a disarray in his dress, filled out and handed him a full glass of lemonade.Freddy Malins’ left hand accepted the glass mechanically, his right hand being engaged in the mechanical readjustment of his dress.Mr. Browne, whose face was once more wrinkling with mirth, poured out for himself a glass of whisky while Freddy Malins exploded, before he had well reached the climax of his story, in a kink of high-pitched bronchitic laughter and, setting down his untasted and overflowing glass, began to rub the knuckles of his left fist backwards and forwards into his left eye, repeating words of his last phrase as well as his fit of laughter would allow him."
"玛丽·简正对着鸦雀无声的客厅弹奏音乐学院学的曲目，尽是连续和高难的段落，但加布里埃尔却听不进去。他喜欢音乐，可她正在弹奏的这首曲子的旋律对他来说却并不动听，他还怀疑对其他听众来说是否动听，尽管是他们请求玛丽·简来弹奏点什么的。有四个年轻男子，他们听到钢琴声就从休息室过来站到门廊里，但几分钟之后就成对悄悄地离开了。唯一貌似在聆听曲调的人只有玛丽·简自己和凯特姨妈。玛丽·简的双手或是飞快地划过键盘或是在停顿的时候抬起来，仿佛一位正在诵念重要咒语的女祭司的双手，而凯特姨妈则站在她的身边翻乐谱。","Gabriel could not listen while Mary Jane was playing her Academy piece, full of runs and difficult passages, to the hushed drawing-room.He liked music but the piece she was playing had no melody for him and he doubted whether it had any melody for the other listeners, though they had begged Mary Jane to play something.Four young men, who had come from the refreshment-room to stand in the doorway at the sound of the piano, had gone away quietly in couples after a few minutes.The only persons who seemed to follow the music were Mary Jane herself, her hands racing along the key-board or lifted from it at the pauses like those of a priestess in momentary imprecation, and Aunt Kate standing at her elbow to turn the page."
"加布里埃尔的眼睛厌倦了那在笨重的枝形吊灯下闪闪发光的打过蜂蜡的地板，于是目光就游移到了钢琴上方的那面墙上。一幅描绘《罗密欧和朱丽叶》中阳台会面那场戏的画挂在那儿，旁边是有关在伦敦塔中被害的那两位王子的一幅画，那是朱莉娅姨妈还是个姑娘的时候用红、蓝、棕三色毛线做成的。可能在她们做姑娘的时候上的那所学校里教过一年的这种手艺课。他母亲曾为他做过一件生日礼物，是一件紫色的波纹塔夫绸背心，上面有小狐狸头图案，衬着棕色的里子，还缀着深紫红色的圆扣。奇怪的是他母亲不曾有过什么音乐天赋，尽管凯特姨妈过去常常称她为莫肯家族智慧的承接人。她和朱莉娅也似乎总是很为她们这个严肃而持重的姐姐感到骄傲。她的相片摆在大穿衣镜前面。她膝盖上放着一本打开的书，正给康斯坦丁指点着书里的什么内容，康斯坦丁穿着一套水手装躺在她的脚边。正是她给儿子们取的名字，因为她非常注重家族生活的尊严体面。多亏了她，康斯坦丁成了巴尔布里根镇的高级副神父，也多亏了她，加布里埃尔自己也在皇家大学拿到了学位。一丝阴影拂过他的脸，因为他想起了她曾生气地反对过他的婚事。她曾用过的一些轻慢的话语仍旧刺痛着他的记忆；她曾经把格雷塔说成是忸怩作态的乡下妞，而格雷塔压根就不是那样。在她最后久病呆在芒克斯顿的那段时间里，正是格雷塔一直在照顾她。","Gabriel’s eyes, irritated by the floor, which glittered with beeswax under the heavy chandelier, wandered to the wall above the piano.A picture of the balcony scene in Romeo and Juliet hung there and beside it was a picture of the two murdered princes in the Tower which Aunt Julia had worked in red, blue and brown wools when she was a girl.Probably in the school they had gone to as girls that kind of work had been taught for one year.His mother had worked for him as a birthday present a waistcoat of purple tabinet, with little foxes’ heads upon it, lined with brown satin and having round mulberry buttons.It was strange that his mother had had no musical talent though Aunt Kate used to call her the brains carrier of the Morkan family.Both she and Julia had always seemed a little proud of their serious and matronly sister.Her photograph stood before the pierglass.She held an open book on her knees and was pointing out something in it to Constantine who, dressed in a man-o-war suit, lay at her feet.It was she who had chosen the name of her sons for she was very sensible of the dignity of family life.Thanks to her, Constantine was now senior curate in Balbrigan and, thanks to her, Gabriel himself had taken his degree in the Royal University.A shadow passed over his face as he remembered her sullen opposition to his marriage.Some slighting phrases she had used still rankled in his memory; she had once spoken of Gretta as being country cute and that was not true of Gretta at all.It was Gretta who had nursed her during all her last long illness in their house at Monkstown."
"他知道玛丽·简肯定快弹完那支曲子了，因为她又在弹开头的那段旋律了，在每一节之后都使用了快奏手法。在等待曲子终了的时候，他心中的愤恨之情渐渐消失了。曲子在一组高音的八度颤音和最后的一组低音八度颤音中结束了。热烈的掌声向玛丽·简表示着致意，而她却红着脸紧张地卷起乐谱逃出了房间。最有劲的掌声来自门廊里的那四个年轻男子，他们在曲子开始的时候去了休息室，而在钢琴声已经停止之后又返了回来。","He knew that Mary Jane must be near the end of her piece for she was playing again the opening melody with runs of scales after every bar and while he waited for the end the resentment died down in his heart.The piece ended with a trill of octaves in the treble and a final deep octave in the bass.Great applause greeted Mary Jane as, blushing and rolling up her music nervously, she escaped from the room.The most vigorous clapping came from the four young men in the doorway who had gone away to the refreshment-room at the beginning of the piece but had come back when the piano had stopped."
"方块舞马上就要开始了。加布里埃尔发现自己和艾弗斯小姐成了舞伴。她是一位举止大方而且健谈的年轻女士，长着一张满是雀斑的脸和一对棕色的向外鼓凸的眼睛。她没有穿低领的紧身胸衣，衣领前面别着的那个大胸针上面有爱尔兰的纹章及铭词。","Lancers were arranged.Gabriel found himself partnered with Miss Ivors.She was a frank-mannered talkative young lady, with a freckled face and prominent brown eyes.She did not wear a low-cut bodice and the large brooch which was fixed in the front of her collar bore on it an Irish device and motto."
"在他们站好位置之后，她突然说道：","When they had taken their places she said abruptly:"
"“我对你很不满。”","“I have a crow to pluck with you.”"
"“对我？”加布里埃尔说。","“With me?” said Gabriel."
"她严肃地点了点头。","She nodded her head gravely."
"“怎么回事儿？”加布里埃尔问道，冲着她那副肃穆的样子微笑着。","“What is it?” asked Gabriel, smiling at her solemn manner."
"“谁是G. C.？”艾弗斯小姐应答道，眼睛注视着他。","“Who is G. C.?” answered Miss Ivors, turning her eyes upon him."
"加布里埃尔脸红了，正要拧起眉头装出不明白的样子，这时她又直白地说道：","Gabriel coloured and was about to knit his brows, as if he did not understand, when she said bluntly:"
"“哦，无辜的艾米！我发现你在给《每日快讯》撰稿。难道你就不为自己感到羞耻吗？”","“O, innocent Amy!I have found out that you write for The Daily Express.Now, aren’t you ashamed of yourself?”"
"“为什么我应该为自己感到羞耻呢？”加布里埃尔问，他眨着眼睛努力想要微笑着。","“Why should I be ashamed of myself?” asked Gabriel, blinking his eyes and trying to smile."
"“听着，我为你感到羞耻，”艾弗斯小姐坦率地说。“你居然会为那样一份报纸撰稿。我从来没想到你会是一个西部英国佬。”","“Well, I’m ashamed of you,” said Miss Ivors frankly.“To say you’d write for a paper like that.I didn’t think you were a West Briton.”"
"一种困惑的表情出现在加布里埃尔的脸上。的确每个星期三他都会为《每日快讯》写一篇文学专栏文章，为此他能得到十五先令的报酬。不过这肯定没有让他成为一个西部英国佬。相比于微不足道的薪水，他更喜欢收到样书的感觉。他喜欢抚摸那些封皮并翻动那些新近才印好的书页。几乎每天在大学里的授课结束之后，他都会沿着码头漫步去那些二手书店，去学士走道上的希基书店，去阿斯顿码头的韦布书店或马西书店，要不就是去小街上的奥克劳西塞书店。他不知道该如何应对她的指责。他想说文学是超越政治的。可他们是有多年交情的朋友，他们的事业也齐头并进，先是上大学，然后是当老师：他不敢和她讲什么大道理。他一边继续眨着眼睛努力想要微笑，一边笨拙地嘟囔着说他看不出写书评会有什么政治的东西。","A look of perplexity appeared on Gabriel’s face.It was true that he wrote a literary column every Wednesday in The Daily Express, for which he was paid fifteen shillings.But that did not make him a West Briton surely.The books he received for review were almost more welcome than the paltry cheque.He loved to feel the covers and turn over the pages of newly printed books.Nearly every day when his teaching in the college was ended he used to wander down the quays to the second-hand booksellers, to Hickey’s on Bachelor’s Walk, to Web’s or Massey’s on Aston’s Quay, or to O’Clohissey’s in the bystreet.He did not know how to meet her charge.He wanted to say that literature was above politics.But they were friends of many years’ standing and their careers had been parallel, first at the University and then as teachers: he could not risk a grandiose phrase with her.He continued blinking his eyes and trying to smile and murmured lamely that he saw nothing political in writing reviews of books."
"当轮到他们跳交叉舞步的时候，他依旧是困惑不已，心神不宁。艾弗斯小姐迅即热情地握住他的一只手，用一种柔和友善的语气说道：","When their turn to cross had come he was still perplexed and inattentive.Miss Ivors promptly took his hand in a warm grasp and said in a soft friendly tone:"
"“当然了，我刚才只是在开玩笑。好了，我们现在来跳交叉舞步吧。”","“Of course, I was only joking.Come, we cross now.”"
"当他们重新回到一起的时候，她谈起了大学的话题，加布里埃尔这才感到自在了好多。她的一个朋友给她看了他写的有关勃朗宁诗歌的评论。这才使得她发现了这个秘密：不过她非常喜欢那篇评论。然后她突然说道：","When they were together again she spoke of the University question and Gabriel felt more at ease.A friend of hers had shown her his review of Browning’s poems.That was how she had found out the secret: but she liked the review immensely.Then she said suddenly:"
"“哦，康罗伊先生，今年夏天你愿意来阿伦岛参加一次旅行吗？我们打算在那里呆上整整一个月。远航到大西洋上肯定会让人非常惬意。你应该来。克兰西先生要来的，还有基尔凯利先生和凯瑟琳·科尔尼。格雷塔如果能来的话肯定也会非常惬意的。她来自康诺特省，对吧？”","“O, Mr. Conroy, will you come for an excursion to the Aran Isles this summer?We’re going to stay there a whole month.It will be splendid out in the Atlantic.You ought to come.Mr. Clancy is coming, and Mr. Kilkelly and Kathleen Kearney.It would be splendid for Gretta too if she’d come.She’s from Connacht, isn’t she?”"
"“她家人来自那儿。”加布里埃尔简短地说道。","“Her people are,” said Gabriel shortly."
"“不过你会来的，对吧？”艾弗斯小姐一边说着一边热切地把她那温暖的手放在了他的胳膊上。","“But you will come, won’t you?” said Miss Ivors, laying her warm hand eagerly on his arm."
"“事实上，”加布里埃尔说，“我已经安排好要去——”","“The fact is,” said Gabriel, “I have just arranged to go——”"
"“要去哪里？”艾弗斯小姐问。","“Go where?” asked Miss Ivors."
"“呃，你知道，每年我都会和一些朋友进行一次自行车旅行，所以——”","“Well, you know, every year I go for a cycling tour with some fellows and so——”"
"“可是去哪里呢？”艾弗斯小姐问。","“But where?” asked Miss Ivors."
"“呃，我们通常去法国或比利时或者也许是德国。”加布里埃尔尴尬地说。","“Well, we usually go to France or Belgium or perhaps Germany,” said Gabriel awkwardly."
"“可你们为什么要去法国和比利时，”艾弗斯小姐说，“而不去游览你们自己的国家呢？”","“And why do you go to France and Belgium,” said Miss Ivors, “instead of visiting your own land?”"
"“呃，”加布里埃尔说，“部分原因是为了接触那几种语言，部分原因是为了换换环境。”","“Well,” said Gabriel, “it’s partly to keep in touch with the languages and partly for a change.”"
"“难道你们没有自己的语言——爱尔兰语——可以接触吗？”艾弗斯小姐问。","“And haven’t you your own language to keep in touch with—Irish?” asked Miss Ivors."
"“呃，”加布里埃尔说，“说到这一点，你要知道，爱尔兰语不是我的母语。”","“Well,” said Gabriel, “if it comes to that, you know, Irish is not my language.”"
"他们身边的几个人都转过身来听起这番盘问来。加布里埃尔紧张地左右看了看，这番考验使得一片红晕渐渐爬上他的前额，他在这考验之下极力保持着自己的好脾气。","Their neighbours had turned to listen to the cross-examination.Gabriel glanced right and left nervously and tried to keep his good humour under the ordeal which was making a blush invade his forehead."
"“难道你们没有自己的国家可以游览吗？”艾弗斯小姐继续说道，“你们对它一无所知，对自己的人民和自己的国家也都一无所知？”","“And haven’t you your own land to visit,” continued Miss Ivors, “that you know nothing of, your own people, and your own country?”"
"“哦，实话告诉你吧，”加布里埃尔突然反驳道，“我讨厌自己的国家，讨厌它！”","“O, to tell you the truth,” retorted Gabriel suddenly, “I’m sick of my own country, sick of it!”"
"“为什么？”艾弗斯小姐问。","“Why?” asked Miss Ivors."
"加布里埃尔没有回答，因为他的反驳已经让自己激动了起来。","Gabriel did not answer for his retort had heated him."
"“为什么？”艾弗斯小姐重复问道。","“Why?” repeated Miss Ivors."
"他们必须得聊点什么，可因为他没有回答她，艾弗斯小姐便和气地说：","They had to go visiting together and, as he had not answered her, Miss Ivors said warmly:"
"“当然了，你没有答案。”","“Of course, you’ve no answer.”"
"为了极力掩饰自己的激动不安，加布里埃尔很卖力地跳起舞来。他躲避着她的眼睛，因为他已经在她的脸上看到了一种失望的表情。可当他们在长长的舞队中碰到一起的时候，他惊讶地发觉自己的手被她的手坚决地按住了。她从眉毛下面嘲弄地看了他一会儿，直到看得他微笑起来。然后，正当舞队又要起动的时候，她踮起脚尖低声和他耳语道：","Gabriel tried to cover his agitation by taking part in the dance with great energy.He avoided her eyes for he had seen a sour expression on her face.But when they met in the long chain he was surprised to feel his hand firmly pressed.She looked at him from under her brows for a moment quizzically until he smiled.Then, just as the chain was about to start again, she stood on tiptoe and whispered into his ear:"
"“西部英国佬！”","“West Briton!”"
"方块舞结束之后，加布里埃尔走到房间的一个僻静的角落，弗雷迪·马林斯的母亲正坐在那里。她是一个身体虚弱、白发苍苍的胖老太太。她的嗓音和她儿子一样有一点儿沙哑，她还略微带点结巴。她已经得知弗雷迪来了，而且他基本上还算不错。加布里埃尔问她渡海时一切是否还好。她和已婚的女儿一起在格拉斯哥生活，一年来都柏林探访一次。她平静地回答说她这次渡海之旅非常顺利，那位船长还对她特别关照。她还谈起了她女儿在格拉斯哥拥有的那栋漂亮的房子，谈起了他们在那儿的所有朋友。在她的舌头喋喋不休的时候，加布里埃尔则极力想把刚才跟艾弗斯小姐发生的那件令人不快的事件从脑子里赶出去。当然那个姑娘或女人，或者无论她是什么，是个民族独立的热心者，可任何事情都要看场合吧。也许他不应该用那种方式来回答她。可即使是开玩笑，她也没有权利在别人面前称他为西部英国佬。她就是极力想让他在人前出丑，对他百般诘问，还用她那双兔子眼睛瞪视他。","When the lancers were over Gabriel went away to a remote corner of the room where Freddy Malins’ mother was sitting.She was a stout feeble old woman with white hair.Her voice had a catch in it like her son’s and she stuttered slightly.She had been told that Freddy had come and that he was nearly all right.Gabriel asked her whether she had had a good crossing.She lived with her married daughter in Glasgow and came to Dublin on a visit once a year.She answered placidly that she had had a beautiful crossing and that the captain had been most attentive to her.She spoke also of the beautiful house her daughter kept in Glasgow, and of all the friends they had there.While her tongue rambled on Gabriel tried to banish from his mind all memory of the unpleasant incident with Miss Ivors.Of course the girl or woman, or whatever she was, was an enthusiast but there was a time for all things.Perhaps he ought not to have answered her like that.But she had no right to call him a West Briton before people, even in joke.She had tried to make him ridiculous before people, heckling him and staring at him with her rabbit’s eyes."
"他看见妻子正穿过跳华尔兹的一对对舞者朝他走来。当她走到他身边的时候，她挨近他的耳朵说道：","He saw his wife making her way towards him through the waltzing couples.When she reached him she said into his ear:"
"“加布里埃尔。凯特姨妈想知道你还愿不愿意像往常一样切鹅肉。戴利小姐会来切火腿，我来做布丁。”","“Gabriel.Aunt Kate wants to know won’t you carve the goose as usual.Miss Daly will carve the ham and I’ll do the pudding.”"
"“行啊。”加布里埃尔说。","“All right,” said Gabriel."
"“这支华尔兹舞曲一结束，她就会先把年轻人打发进去，这样我们就可以用这张桌子了。”","“She’s sending in the younger ones first as soon as this waltz is over so that we’ll have the table to ourselves.”"
"“你跳舞了吗？”加布里埃尔问。","“Were you dancing?” asked Gabriel."
"“我当然跳了。难道你没看见我吗？你跟莫莉·艾弗斯争吵什么了？”","“Of course I was.Didn’t you see me?What row had you with Molly Ivors?”"
"“没有争吵什么。怎么了？她这样说的？”","“No row.Why? Did she say so?”"
"“差不多吧。我要去让那个达西先生来演唱一曲。他真是很自负，我觉得。”","“Something like that.I‘m trying to get that Mr. D’Arcy to sing.He’s full of conceit, I think.”"
"“没有争吵什么，”加布里埃尔郁郁不乐地说，“只是她想让我到爱尔兰西部进行一次旅行，可我说我不想去。”","“There was no row,” said Gabriel moodily, “only she wanted me to go for a trip to the west of Ireland and I said I wouldn’t.”"
"他的妻子兴奋地双手紧握，然后跳了一下。","His wife clasped her hands excitedly and gave a little jump."
"“哦，去吧，加布里埃尔，”她叫道，“我真想再看看戈尔韦海湾。”","“O, do go, Gabriel,” she cried.“I’d love to see Galway again.”"
"“你要想去你可以去。”加布里埃尔冷冷地说。","“You can go if you like,” said Gabriel coldly."
"她盯着他看了一会儿，然后转向马林斯太太说：","She looked at him for a moment, then turned to Mrs. Malins and said:"
"“这么一个好丈夫就留给您了，马林斯太太。”","“There’s a nice husband for you, Mrs. Malins.”"
"她按原路穿过房间走了回去，而马林斯太太则没有注意到这段插曲，继续给加布里埃尔讲苏格兰有多么美丽的地方和多么美丽的景色。她的女婿每年都会带他们去湖区，他们还常常去钓鱼。她的女婿是一位钓鱼高手。有一天他钓到了一条漂亮的大鱼，然后旅馆里的厨师把鱼做成了他们的晚餐。","While she was threading her way back across the room Mrs. Malins, without adverting to the interruption, went on to tell Gabriel what beautiful places there were in Scotland and beautiful scenery.Her son-in-law brought them every year to the lakes and they used to go fishing.Her son-in-law was a splendid fisher.One day he caught a beautiful big fish and the man in the hotel cooked it for their dinner."
"加布里埃尔几乎没有听到她在说些什么。因为晚餐马上就要开始，所以他又开始琢磨他的演讲词以及要引用的诗句。他看见弗雷迪·马林斯正穿过房间来看望他的母亲，于是便把椅子腾出来让他坐，自己则退隐到了斜面窗洞里。房间已经清理好了，从后面的房间传来了杯盘刀叉的碰撞声。仍然逗留在客厅的那些人似乎跳舞跳得也累了，正一小群一小群地聚在一起安静地交谈着。加布里埃尔那温暖而颤抖的手指敲打着冰冷的窗玻璃。外面该会有多么凉啊！要是能独自在外面散散步，先沿着河边，然后再穿过公园，那该会有多么惬意啊！雪会落在树枝上，会在威灵顿纪念碑上形成一顶白晃晃的雪帽。呆在那儿比呆在餐桌边该会惬意多少倍啊！","Gabriel hardly heard what she said.Now that supper was coming near he began to think again about his speech and about the quotation.When he saw Freddy Malins coming across the room to visit his mother Gabriel left the chair free for him and retired into the embrasure of the window.The room had already cleared and from the back room came the clatter of plates and knives.Those who still remained in the drawing room seemed tired of dancing and were conversing quietly in little groups.Gabriel’s warm trembling fingers tapped the cold pane of the window.How cool it must be outside!How pleasant it would be to walk out alone, first along by the river and then through the park!The snow would be lying on the branches of the trees and forming a bright cap on the top of the Wellington Monument.How much more pleasant it would be there than at the supper-table!"
"他匆匆看了一遍演讲稿的论题：爱尔兰人的好客之道、悲伤的记忆、美惠三女神、帕里斯、勃朗宁的诗句。他默念了自己在书评里写过的一句话：“一个人感觉到自己正在聆听一支经过苦思冥想才创作出来的乐曲。”艾弗斯小姐曾经赞扬过那篇评论。她是真心的吗？在所有张扬个性的背后她真的拥有自己的生活吗？今晚之前他们之间从来没有过任何敌意。想到她会坐在餐桌边，在他发言的时候抬头用她那挑剔嘲弄的眼神看着他，他便觉得心慌意乱。也许她看到他演讲失败都不会感到愧疚。一个念头闪现在他的脑子里，给了他勇气。在暗指凯特姨妈和朱莉娅姨妈时，他会说：“女士们，先生们，我们中间正渐渐衰老的一代也许有他们的缺点，但是在我看来，我认为他们具有好客、幽默、以及人道主义方面的某些品质，而这些正是我们中间正在成长的、非常严肃的、且受了太高教育的新一代人所缺乏的品质。”非常好：这正好是针对艾弗斯小姐的。他的姨妈们只是两个没有学识的老太太，可那又关他什么事呢？","He ran over the headings of his speech: Irish hospitality, sad memories, the Three Graces, Paris, the quotation from Browning.He repeated to himself a phrase he had written in his review: “One feels that one is listening to a thought-tormented music.” Miss Ivors had praised the review.Was she sincere?Had she really any life of her own behind all her propagandism?There had never been any ill-feeling between them until that night.It unnerved him to think that she would be at the supper-table, looking up at him while he spoke with her critical quizzing eyes.Perhaps she would not be sorry to see him fail in his speech.An idea came into his mind and gave him courage.He would say, alluding to Aunt Kate and Aunt Julia: “Ladies and Gentlemen, the generation which is now on the wane among us may have had its faults but for my part I think it had certain qualities of hospitality, of humour, of humanity, which the new and very serious and hypereducated generation that is growing up around us seems to me to lack.” Very good: that was one for Miss Ivors.What did he care that his aunts were only two ignorant old women?"
"房间里的一阵低语声吸引了他的注意。布朗先生正从门口走进来，殷勤地陪伴着朱莉娅姨妈，而朱莉娅姨妈则倚靠着他的胳膊，微笑着低垂着头。一阵稀稀落落的掌声伴随着她一直走到钢琴边，然后玛丽·简在琴凳上坐下，而朱莉娅姨妈也不再微笑，半转着身子以便能让她的声音更好地传遍房间，接着掌声渐渐停息了下来。加布里埃尔听出了前奏曲。那是朱莉娅姨妈会唱的一首老歌的前奏曲——《为婚礼而打扮》。她的嗓音铿锵清亮，情绪饱满地向点缀这支曲子的快奏部分发起冲击，尽管她唱得很快，但她却没有漏掉哪怕是最细小的装饰音。跟着这嗓音，不要去看歌唱者的脸，必定会感受和分享到那种轻快而安全的飞翔所带来的兴奋。歌曲结束时，加布里埃尔和其他人一起大声地鼓掌，响亮的掌声还从挡住的餐桌旁传了过来。掌声听上去非常真诚，当朱莉娅姨妈弯身把那本封皮上写着她的名字首字母的皮面歌本放回到乐谱架的时候，一抹红晕悄悄爬上了她的脸庞。弗雷迪·马林斯刚才听歌的时候一直侧歪着头以便能更好地听她唱歌，在其他人都已经停下来的时候他仍旧在鼓掌，一边还激动地和他母亲说着话，他母亲严肃而缓慢地点着头默然表示着同意。终于，在他实在不宜继续鼓掌的时候，他突然站了起来，匆匆穿过房间走到朱莉娅姨妈跟前，一下抓住她的一只手，握在自己的双手里，摇晃着那只手，因为他不知该说什么好或者说他声音里的顿塞已经让他说不出话来。","A murmur in the room attracted his attention.Mr. Browne was advancing from the door, gallantly escorting Aunt Julia, who leaned upon his arm, smiling and hanging her head.An irregular musketry of applause escorted her also as far as the piano and then, as Mary Jane seated herself on the stool, and Aunt Julia, no longer smiling, half turned so as to pitch her voice fairly into the room, gradually ceased.Gabriel recognised the prelude.It was that of an old song of Aunt Julia’s—Arrayed for the Bridal.Her voice, strong and clear in tone, attacked with great spirit the runs which embellish the air and though she sang very rapidly she did not miss even the smallest of the grace notes.To follow the voice, without looking at the singer’s face, was to feel and share the excitement of swift and secure flight.Gabriel applauded loudly with all the others at the close of the song and loud applause was borne in from the invisible supper-table.It sounded so genuine that a little colour struggled into Aunt Julia’s face as she bent to replace in the music-stand the old leather-bound songbook that had her initials on the cover.Freddy Malins, who had listened with his head perched sideways to hear her better, was still applauding when everyone else had ceased and talking animatedly to his mother who nodded her head gravely and slowly in acquiescence.At last, when he could clap no more, he stood up suddenly and hurried across the room to Aunt Julia whose hand he seized and held in both his hands, shaking it when words failed him or the catch in his voice proved too much for him."
"“我刚刚一直在给我母亲讲，”他说，“我从来没有听您唱得这么好，从来没有过。没有过，我从来没有听到过您的声音能像今晚这么美妙。啊！您能相信吗？可这就是事实。凭着我的誓言和荣誉起誓，这就是事实。我从来没有听到过您的声音听上去会如此清新，如此……如此清亮和清新，从来没有过。”","“I was just telling my mother,” he said, “I never heard you sing so well, never.No, I never heard your voice so good as it is tonight.Now! Would you believe that now?That’s the truth.Upon my word and honour that’s the truth.I never heard your voice sound so fresh and so... so clear and fresh, never.”"
"朱莉娅姨妈把手从他的紧握中抽出来，她开心地微笑着，同时还咕哝着过誉了之类的话。布朗先生冲她伸出了张开的手掌，然后用一种演出主持人向观众介绍奇人异事的方式对他身边的人说道：","Aunt Julia smiled broadly and murmured something about compliments as she released her hand from his grasp.Mr. Browne extended his open hand towards her and said to those who were near him in the manner of a showman introducing a prodigy to an audience:"
"“朱莉娅·莫肯小姐，我的最新发现！”","“Miss Julia Morkan, my latest discovery!”"
"他正因为自己说的这番话而尽情大笑的时候，弗雷迪·马林斯转过来对他说：","He was laughing very heartily at this himself when Freddy Malins turned to him and said:"
"“好了，布朗，如果你是当真的，那么你可能会有一个更糟的发现。我能说的是，我来这儿这么长时间从来没有听过她唱得有这一半好过。这可是实实在在的事实。”","“Well, Browne, if you’re serious you might make a worse discovery.All I can say is I never heard her sing half so well as long as I am coming here.And that’s the honest truth.”"
"“我也从来没有听到过，”布朗先生说，“我觉得她的声音有了很大的进步。”","“Neither did I,” said Mr. Browne.“I think her voice has greatly improved.”"
"朱莉娅姨妈耸了耸肩，带着一种温顺的自豪说：","Aunt Julia shrugged her shoulders and said with meek pride:"
"“三十年前我可从来没有过难听的声音。”","“Thirty years ago I hadn’t a bad voice as voices go.”"
"“我常常跟朱莉娅说，”凯特姨妈特别强调说，“她在那个唱诗班简直就是浪费了。可她从来都不愿让我说她。”","“I often told Julia,” said Aunt Kate emphatically, “that she was simply thrown away in that choir.But she never would be said by me.”"
"她转过身，仿佛是要吁求其他人的理智来一块对付一个执拗的孩子，而朱莉娅姨妈则凝视着她的前方，一种若隐若现的回想的微笑浮现在她的脸上。","She turned as if to appeal to the good sense of the others against a refractory child while Aunt Julia gazed in front of her, a vague smile of reminiscence playing on her face."
"“不愿意，”凯特姨妈继续说道，“她就是不愿意让任何人说她或引导她，就在那个唱诗班里做奴隶，整日整夜，整日整夜。圣诞节早上六点钟就得起床！可这一切都为了什么？”","“No,” continued Aunt Kate, “she wouldn’t be said or led by anyone, slaving there in that choir night and day, night and day.Six o’clock on Christmas morning!And all for what?”"
"“好了，难道那不是为了上帝的荣誉吗，凯特姨妈？”玛丽·简从琴凳上扭过来微笑着问道。","“Well, isn’t it for the honour of God, Aunt Kate?” asked Mary Jane, twisting round on the piano-stool and smiling."
"凯特姨妈猛然转向她的侄女说：","Aunt Kate turned fiercely on her niece and said:"
"“关于上帝的荣誉之类的话我都懂，玛丽·简，可我觉得教皇把一辈子都在那里做奴隶的女人们从唱诗班里赶出来，然后把那些妄自尊大的小男孩们安置到她们的头上去，这根本就没有什么可值得荣耀的。我猜教皇这样做是为了教会的利益。可是这不公正，玛丽·简，这也不对。”","“I know all about the honour of God, Mary Jane, but I think it’s not at all honourable for the pope to turn out the women out of the choirs that have slaved there all their lives and put little whipper-snappers of boys over their heads.I suppose it is for the good of the Church if the pope does it.But it’s not just, Mary Jane, and it’s not right.”"
"她已经激动不已，本想继续为她的姐姐辩护，因为这个话题让她感到恼火，不过玛丽·简见所有跳舞的人都回来了，便息事宁人地插话道：","She had worked herself into a passion and would have continued in defence of her sister for it was a sore subject with her but Mary Jane, seeing that all the dancers had come back, intervened pacifically:"
"“好了，凯特姨妈，您会让布朗先生有机可乘的，他可是属于另一个教派的。”","“Now, Aunt Kate, you’re giving scandal to Mr. Browne who is of the other persuasion.”"
"凯特姨妈转向布朗先生，而布朗先生正因为有人提到了自己的宗教信仰而咧着嘴笑，凯特姨妈急忙说道：","Aunt Kate turned to Mr. Browne, who was grinning at this allusion to his religion, and said hastily:"
"“哦，我不是质疑教皇的做法不对。我只是一个愚蠢的老太太，所以我不会冒然去做这种事。不过总有公认的一般的礼貌和感激吧。如果我处在朱莉娅的位置上，我就会当面告诉那个希利神父……”","“O, I don’t question the pope’s being right.I’m only a stupid old woman and I wouldn’t presume to do such a thing.But there’s such a thing as common everyday politeness and gratitude.And if I were in Julia’s place I’d tell that Father Healey straight up to his face...”"
"“再说了，凯特姨妈，”玛丽·简说，“我们确实都饿了，而人在饿了的时候都会很喜欢吵嘴的。”","“And besides, Aunt Kate,” said Mary Jane, “we really are all hungry and when we are hungry we are all very quarrelsome.”"
"“而我们在渴了的时候也会很喜欢吵嘴的。”布朗先生补充道。","“And when we are thirsty we are also quarrelsome,” added Mr. Browne."
"“所以我们最好先去吃晚饭吧，”玛丽·简说，“然后再讨论个结果。”","“So that we had better go to supper,” said Mary Jane, “and finish the discussion afterwards.”"
"在客厅外面的楼梯平台处，加布里埃尔发现妻子和玛丽·简正在极力劝说艾弗斯小姐留下来吃晚餐。但是艾弗斯小姐已经戴好了帽子，正在扣风衣的扣子，她执意要走。她一点都不觉得饿，而且她呆的时间已经太长了。","On the landing outside the drawing-room Gabriel found his wife and Mary Jane trying to persuade Miss Ivors to stay for supper.But Miss Ivors, who had put on her hat and was buttoning her cloak, would not stay.She did not feel in the least hungry and she had already overstayed her time."
"“再呆十分钟，莫莉，”康罗伊太太说，“那不会耽搁你的。”","“But only for ten minutes, Molly,” said Mrs. Conroy.“That won’t delay you.”"
"“来少吃点吧，”玛丽·简说，“你跳了那么多舞。”","“To take a pick itself,” said Mary Jane, “after all your dancing.”"
"“我实在不能再呆了。”艾弗斯小姐说。","“I really couldn’t,” said Miss Ivors."
"“我恐怕你根本就玩得不畅快吧。”玛丽·简绝望地说。","“I am afraid you didn’t enjoy yourself at all,” said Mary Jane hopelessly."
"“从来没有玩得这么畅快过，我向你保证，”艾弗斯小姐说，“不过现在你确实得让我走了。”","“Ever so much, I assure you,” said Miss Ivors, “but you really must let me run off now.”"
"“可你怎么回家呢？”康罗伊太太问。","“But how can you get home?” asked Mrs. Conroy."
"“哦，只有两步就能到码头。”","“O, it’s only two steps up the quay.”"
"加布里埃尔犹豫了片刻，然后说道：","Gabriel hesitated a moment and said:"
"“要是你允许，艾弗斯小姐，而且要是你必须得走的话，那我送你回家吧。”","“If you will allow me, Miss Ivors, I’ll see you home if you are really obliged to go.”"
"但是艾弗斯小姐却把他们挣脱开来。","But Miss Ivors broke away from them."
"“我不想再听这些话了，”她叫道，“看在上帝的份上，进去吃你们的晚饭去吧，不要再管我了。我完全能照顾好自己的。”","“I won’t hear of it,” she cried.“For goodness‘ sake go in to your suppers and don’t mind me. I’m quite well able to take care of myself.”"
"“好吧，你真是个怪女孩，莫莉。”康罗伊太太坦率地说。","“Well, you’re the comical girl, Molly,” said Mrs. Conroy frankly."
"“Beannacht libh！”艾弗斯小姐大笑着喊了一声，然后沿着楼梯跑了下去。","“Beannacht libh,” cried Miss Ivors, with a laugh, as she ran down the staircase."
"玛丽·简在后面凝视着她，一种忧郁困惑的表情浮现在脸上，而康罗伊太太则趴在扶手上听着厅门处的动静。加布里埃尔自问着他是不是她突然离开的起因。不过她看上去心情似乎并不坏：她是笑着离开的。他茫然地盯着楼梯。","Mary Jane gazed after her, a moody puzzled expression on her face, while Mrs. Conroy leaned over the banisters to listen for the hall-door.Gabriel asked himself was he the cause of her abrupt departure.But she did not seem to be in ill humour: she had gone away laughing.He stared blankly down the staircase."
"就在这时，凯特姨妈蹒跚地从吃晚餐的那个房间走了出来，绝望地几乎要拧起手来了。","At the moment Aunt Kate came toddling out of the supper-room, almost wringing her hands in despair."
"“加布里埃尔在哪里？”她喊道，“加布里埃尔到底在哪里？大家都在那里等着呢，冷场啦，没有人来切鹅肉！”","“Where is Gabriel?” she cried.“Where on earth is Gabriel?There’s everyone waiting in there, stage to let, and nobody to carve the goose!”"
"“我来了，凯特姨妈！”加布里埃尔突然很有活力地叫道，“我准备切一群鹅，如果需要的话。”","“Here I am, Aunt Kate!” cried Gabriel, with sudden animation, “ready to carve a flock of geese, if necessary.”"
"桌子的一端放着一只颜色焦黄的肥鹅，另一端在撒着欧芹嫩叶的一张绉纸上放着一根大火腿，已经被剥去了外皮，周身都涂满了干面包屑，在胫骨处套着一个雅致的纸圈，旁边是一大块五香牛肉。在这互相媲美的两端之间并排放着两列副菜：两小盘堆得满满的果冻，红黄相间；满满一浅盘牛奶冻块和红果酱，一个带着茎干状把手的树叶形绿色大盘上面放着几串紫葡萄和去了皮的杏仁，旁边一个配盘上面放着长方形的士麦那无花果，一碟顶上点缀着肉豆蔻屑的蛋奶糕，满满一小碗包裹着金银纸的巧克力和糖果，还有一个插着几根长长的香芹杆的玻璃花瓶。桌子中间放着一个果盘，上面的橘子和美国苹果摆成了金字塔形状，果盘两边是两个卫兵似的老式大肚雕花玻璃酒瓶，一瓶里面盛着波尔图葡萄酒，另一瓶里盛着红色雪利酒。在合着盖的钢琴上，一个大黄盘子里一块布丁正等着人们去享用，后面放着黑啤酒、麦芽酒和矿泉水三种瓶装饮料，按照它们外观颜色的不同整齐排列着，前两排是黑瓶，贴着棕色和红色的标签，第三排和最小的一排是白瓶，瓶颈处系着绿色的丝带。","A fat brown goose lay at one end of the table and at the other end, on a bed of creased paper strewn with sprigs of parsley, lay a great ham, stripped of its outer skin and peppered over with crust crumbs, a neat paper frill round its shin and beside this was a round of spiced beef.Between these rival ends ran parallel lines of side-dishes: two little minsters of jelly, red and yellow; a shallow dish full of blocks of blancmange and red jam, a large green leaf-shaped dish with a stalk-shaped handle, on which lay bunches of purple raisins and peeled almonds, a companion dish on which lay a solid rectangle of Smyrna figs, a dish of custard topped with grated nutmeg, a small bowl full of chocolates and sweets wrapped in gold and silver papers and a glass vase in which stood some tall celery stalks.In the centre of the table there stood, as sentries to a fruit-stand which upheld a pyramid of oranges and American apples, two squat old-fashioned decanters of cut glass, one containing port and the other dark sherry.On the closed square piano a pudding in a huge yellow dish lay in waiting and behind it were three squads of bottles of stout and ale and minerals, drawn up according to the colours of their uniforms, the first two black, with brown and red labels, the third and smallest squad white, with transverse green sashes."
"加布里埃尔毫不拘礼地坐在了桌首的位子上，他瞅了瞅切刀的刀刃，然后一下子把叉子牢牢地戳进了鹅肉里。他现在感觉非常自在，因为他切肉十分熟练，他最喜欢的莫过于坐在一张摆好食物的餐桌旁。","Gabriel took his seat boldly at the head of the table and, having looked to the edge of the carver, plunged his fork firmly into the goose.He felt quite at ease now for he was an expert carver and liked nothing better than to find himself at the head of a well-laden table."
"“弗朗小姐，我该给您什么样的肉呢？”他问，“一个翅膀还是一块胸脯肉？”","“Miss Furlong, what shall I send you?” he asked.“A wing or a slice of the breast?”"
"“就来一小块胸脯肉吧。”","“Just a small slice of the breast.”"
"“希金斯小姐，您要什么肉？”","“Miss Higgins, what for you?”"
"“哦，什么都可以，康罗伊先生。”","“O, anything at all, Mr. Conroy.”"
"加布里埃尔和戴利小姐交换着盛鹅肉的盘子以及盛火腿与五香牛肉的盘子，而莉莉则端着包裹在白色餐巾里的一盘糖粉热土豆一个客人一个客人地分送着。这是玛丽·简的主意，她还建议在鹅肉上加点苹果酱，但凯特姨妈说不加苹果酱的家常烤鹅对她而言一直就足够好吃了，她不希望吃到不好吃的鹅肉。玛丽·简招呼着自己的学生们，确保他们能分到最好的肉片，凯特姨妈和朱莉娅姨妈则在钢琴那里打开那些饮料瓶子，黑啤酒和麦芽酒拿给先生们，矿泉水拿给女士们。一片喧嚣声和欢笑声，有要菜和拒绝要菜的嘈杂声，有刀叉撞击的嘈杂声，还有软木塞和玻璃瓶盖启启合合的嘈杂声。加布里埃尔没有留下自己的一份，他切完了第一轮紧接着就开始切第二份肉。所有的人都大声反对，于是他妥协了，他喝了一大口黑啤酒，因为他发觉切肉这差事已经让他浑身发热。玛丽·简安静地坐下来享用她的晚餐，可凯特姨妈和朱莉娅姨妈则仍然蹒跚着在餐桌周围忙碌着，一个紧跟在另一个的身后，经常就挡住了对方的路，还给对方下达各种吩咐，却互不理会。布朗先生请求她们坐下来吃晚餐，加布里埃尔也请求她们这样做，可她们却说还有足够的时间，就这样，最后，弗雷迪·马林斯站起来，抓住了凯特姨妈，一把将她按坐到了椅子上，惹来一片笑声。","While Gabriel and Miss Daly exchanged plates of goose and plates of ham and spiced beef Lily went from guest to guest with a dish of hot floury potatoes wrapped in a white napkin.This was Mary Jane’s idea and she had also suggested apple sauce for the goose but Aunt Kate had said that plain roast goose without any apple sauce had always been good enough for her and she hoped she might never eat worse.Mary Jane waited on her pupils and saw that they got the best slices and Aunt Kate and Aunt Julia opened and carried across from the piano bottles of stout and ale for the gentlemen and bottles of minerals for the ladies.There was a great deal of confusion and laughter and noise, the noise of orders and counter-orders, of knives and forks, of corks and glass-stoppers.Gabriel began to carve second helpings as soon as he had finished the first round without serving himself.Everyone protested loudly so that he compromised by taking a long draught of stout for he had found the carving hot work.Mary Jane settled down quietly to her supper but Aunt Kate and Aunt Julia were still toddling round the table, walking on each other’s heels, getting in each other’s way and giving each other unheeded orders.Mr. Browne begged of them to sit down and eat their suppers and so did Gabriel but they said there was time enough, so that, at last, Freddy Malins stood up and, capturing Aunt Kate, plumped her down on her chair amid general laughter."
"在每个人都得到了很好的招待之后，加布里埃尔微笑着说：","When everyone had been well served Gabriel said, smiling:"
"“好了，如果有谁还想再来点俗人们所说的填料，那就请说一声。”","“Now, if anyone wants a little more of what vulgar people call stuffing let him or her speak.”"
"大家齐声请他开始享用自己的晚餐，莉莉拿着三个土豆走过来，那是她专门给他留的。","A chorus of voices invited him to begin his own supper and Lily came forward with three potatoes which she had reserved for him."
"“很好，”加布里埃尔和蔼地说，然后又喝了一口餐前酒，“那就请施我恩惠，忘记我的存在吧，女士们，先生们，就几分钟。”","“Very well,” said Gabriel amiably, as he took another preparatory draught, “kindly forget my existence, ladies and gentlemen, for a few minutes.”"
"他坐下来吃起晚餐来，没有加入到莉莉撤掉盘子时餐桌上一直在进行的谈话中去。谈论的话题是当时正在皇家剧院演出的歌剧团。巴特尔·达西先生，那个男高音，是个面色黝黑的年轻人，蓄着一撇漂亮的小胡子，他高度赞扬了这个剧团的女低音，但是弗朗小姐却认为她的表演有一种相当粗俗的风格。弗雷迪·马林斯说配乐哑剧表演的下半场有一个黑人酋长唱得很好，那声音是他听过的最美妙的男高音之一。","He set to his supper and took no part in the conversation with which the table covered Lily’s removal of the plates.The subject of talk was the opera company which was then at the Theatre Royal.Mr. Bartell D’Arcy, the tenor, a dark-complexioned young man with a smart moustache, praised very highly the leading contralto of the company but Miss Furlong thought she had a rather vulgar style of production.Freddy Malins said there was a Negro chieftain singing in the second part of the Gaiety pantomime who had one of the finest tenor voices he had ever heard."
"“你听过他唱吗？”他隔着桌子问巴特尔·达西先生。","“Have you heard him?” he asked Mr. Bartell D’Arcy across the table."
"“没有。”巴特尔·达西先生漫不经心地回答道。","“No,” answered Mr. Bartell D’Arcy carelessly."
"“因为，”弗雷迪·马林斯解释道，“现在我很想听听您对他的看法。我觉得他有一副好嗓子。”","“Because,” Freddy Malins explained, “now I’d be curious to hear your opinion of him. I think he has a grand voice.”"
"“得要特迪才能发现真正的好东西。”布朗先生很随意地冲餐桌旁的人们说道。","“It takes Teddy to find out the really good things,” said Mr. Browne familiarly to the table."
"“为什么他就不能有一副好嗓子？”弗雷迪·马林斯尖锐地问道，“就因为他是个黑人吗？”","“And why couldn’t he have a voice too?” asked Freddy Malins sharply.“Is it because he’s only a black?”"
"没有人回答这个问题，玛丽·简把餐桌上的话题引回到了舞台剧上。她的一个学生给了她一张《梅娘》的演出票。当然这部歌剧非常好，她说，不过它让她想起了可怜的乔治安娜·伯恩斯。布朗先生还能回述到更早以前的事情，他提到了过去常来都柏林的那些老式的意大利剧团——蒂金斯、伊尔毛·德·穆尔扎卡、坎帕尼尼、伟大的特雷贝利、朱利尼、拉韦利、阿兰布罗。他说，在那些日子里，都柏林还是能听到些像样的演唱的。他还讲到了旧皇家剧院的顶层楼座过去是怎样一夜又一夜地爆满，讲到了有一天晚上一个意大利男高音在唱完《让我像一个战士那样倒下》之后怎样应观众的要求又加演了五次，每次都会唱一个高音C，讲到了顶层楼座的那些年轻男观众们有时会怎样充满热情地把某位著名的首席女演员马车上的马匹解掉，然后他们自己拉着那辆马车穿过条条街道把她送回到她住的旅馆。他问，他们现在为什么从来都不排演诸如《迪诺拉》和《卢克雷齐娅·博尔贾》之类宏大的老式歌剧了呢？因为他们找不到好嗓子来演唱这些歌剧了：这就是原因所在。","Nobody answered this question and Mary Jane led the table back to the legitimate opera.One of her pupils had given her a pass for Mignon.Of course it was very fine, she said, but it made her think of poor Georgina Burns.Mr. Browne could go back farther still, to the old Italian companies that used to come to Dublin—Tietjens, Ilma de Murzka, Campanini, the great Trebelli, Giuglini, Ravelli, Aramburo.Those were the days, he said, when there was something like singing to be heard in Dublin.He told too of how the top gallery of the old Royal used to be packed night after night, of how one night an Italian tenor had sung five encores to Let me like a Soldier fall, introducing a high C every time, and of how the gallery boys would sometimes in their enthusiasm unyoke the horses from the carriage of some great prima donna and pull her themselves through the streets to her hotel.Why did they never play the grand old operas now, he asked, Dinorah, Lucrezia Borgia?Because they could not get the voices to sing them: that was why."
"“哦，不过，”巴特尔·达西先生说，“我觉得如今也有和过去一样好的歌手。”","“Oh, well,” said Mr. Bartell D’Arcy, “I presume there are as good singers today as there were then.”"
"“他们在哪里？”布朗先生不服气地反问道。","“Where are they?” asked Mr. Browne defiantly."
"“在伦敦、巴黎、米兰。”巴特尔·达西先生热情地说道，“我认为卡鲁索，比如说，即使好不过你提到的那几位中的任何一位，他也不比他们差。”","“In London, Paris, Milan,” said Mr. Bartell D’Arcy warmly.“I suppose Caruso, for example, is quite as good, if not better than any of the men you have mentioned.”"
"“或许是那样吧，”布朗先生说，“不过我对此非常怀疑。”","“Maybe so,” said Mr. Browne.“But I may tell you I doubt it strongly.”"
"“哦，我愿意付出任何代价来听卡鲁索演唱。”玛丽·简说。","“O, I’d give anything to hear Caruso sing,” said Mary Jane."
"“对我来说，”一直在剔骨头的凯特姨妈说道，“曾经只出现过一位男高音。我是说，能让我感到满意。不过我觉得你们都没听说过他。”","“For me,” said Aunt Kate, who had been picking a bone, “there was only one tenor.To please me, I mean.But I suppose none of you ever heard of him.”"
"“他是谁，莫肯小姐？”巴特尔·达西先生礼貌地问道。","“Who was he, Miss Morkan?” asked Mr. Bartell D’Arcy politely."
"“他的名字，”凯特姨妈说，“叫帕金森。在他的鼎盛时期我曾听过他演唱，我认为他拥有当时男人的喉咙能发出的最纯净的男高音。”","“His name,” said Aunt Kate, “was Parkinson.I heard him when he was in his prime and I think he had then the purest tenor voice that was ever put into a man’s throat.”"
"“奇怪，”巴特尔·达西先生说，“我从来没有听说过他。”","“Strange,” said Mr. Bartell D’Arcy.“I never even heard of him.”"
"“是的，是的，莫肯小姐是对的，”布朗先生说，“我记得听说过老帕金森，不过他对我来说可是太过久远了。”","“Yes, yes, Miss Morkan is right,” said Mr. Browne.“I remember hearing of old Parkinson but he’s too far back for me.”"
"“一种漂亮、纯正、甜美、醇厚的英国男高音。”凯特姨妈热情地说道。","“A beautiful, pure, sweet, mellow English tenor,” said Aunt Kate with enthusiasm."
"加布里埃尔吃完了，那块巨大的布丁被转移到了桌子上。叉子和汤匙的撞击声再次响起。加布里埃尔的妻子把布丁一勺一勺地分开，然后把盘子沿着桌子传了下去。传到中间，玛丽·简接在手里，加了些紫莓或橘子果冻，还加了些牛奶冻和果酱。布丁是朱莉娅姨妈的杰作，她收到了来自桌子各个方向的夸赞。她自己却说做得还不够焦黄。","Gabriel having finished, the huge pudding was transferred to the table.The clatter of forks and spoons began again.Gabriel’s wife served out spoonfuls of the pudding and passed the plates down the table.Midway down they were held up by Mary Jane, who replenished them with raspberry or orange jelly or with blancmange and jam.The pudding was of Aunt Julia’s making and she received praises for it from all quarters. She herself said that it was not quite brown enough."
"“好了，我希望，莫肯小姐，”布朗先生说，“我对你来说是足够焦黄了，因为，你要知道，我的名字就是‘焦黄’啊。”","“Well, I hope, Miss Morkan,” said Mr. Browne, “that I‘m brown enough for you because, you know, I’m all brown.”"
"所有的男士，除了加布里埃尔，都因为朱莉娅姨妈受到的赞扬而吃了些布丁。加布里埃尔从来不吃甜点，所以香芹就都留给了他。弗雷迪·马林斯也拿了一根香芹就着布丁一块儿吃了。他听说香芹是有利于血液的一种好东西，而他当时又恰好在接受医生的治疗。马林斯太太整个晚餐过程中一直保持沉默，这时说道，她的儿子再过一个星期左右就要去梅勒雷山了。然后餐桌上的话题就谈论起了梅勒雷山，说那里的空气是如何清新，修道士们是如何好客，他们又是如何从来都不向客人们索要一分钱。","All the gentlemen, except Gabriel, ate some of the pudding out of compliment to Aunt Julia.As Gabriel never ate sweets the celery had been left for him. Freddy Malins also took a stalk of celery and ate it with his pudding.He had been told that celery was a capital thing for the blood and he was just then under doctor’s care.Mrs. Malins, who had been silent all through the supper, said that her son was going down to Mount Melleray in a week or so. The table then spoke of Mount Melleray, how bracing the air was down there, how hospitable the monks were and how they never asked for a penny-piece from their guests."
"“你的意思是说，”布朗先生不相信地问道，“一个人可以住到那里，如同住旅馆一样，可以享用那里的美物，然后打道回府却不用付钱？”","“And do you mean to say,” asked Mr. Browne incredulously, “that a chap can go down there and put up there as if it were a hotel and live on the fat of the land and then come away without paying anything?”"
"“哦，大多数人在他们离开的时候都会给修道院捐助些钱款的。”玛丽·简说。","“O, most people give some donation to the monastery when they leave.” said Mary Jane."
"“我希望在我们的教派里也能有这样一种惯例。”布朗先生坦诚地说。","“I wish we had an institution like that in our Church,” said Mr. Browne candidly."
"听说修道士们从来不说话，凌晨两点起床，在棺材里睡觉，他大为惊讶。他问他们做这些都是为了什么。","He was astonished to hear that the monks never spoke, got up at two in the morning and slept in their coffins.He asked what they did it for."
"“这是教会的规矩。”凯特姨妈肯定地说道。","“That’s the rule of the order,” said Aunt Kate firmly."
"“是，可为什么呢？”布朗先生问。","“Yes, but why?” asked Mr. Browne."
"凯特姨妈重复说这是规矩，仅此而已。布朗先生似乎仍不明白。弗雷迪·马林斯尽自己所能地向他解释说，修道士们是在尽力弥补罪过，弥补外面的世界中所有的罪人犯下的罪过。这种解释不很清楚，因为布朗先生咧嘴一笑又说：","Aunt Kate repeated that it was the rule, that was all.Mr. Browne still seemed not to understand.Freddy Malins explained to him, as best he could, that the monks were trying to make up for the sins committed by all the sinners in the outside world.The explanation was not very clear for Mr. Browne grinned and said:"
"“我很喜欢这种想法，但是一张舒适的弹簧床和一口棺材对他们的作用难道不是一样吗？”","“I like that idea very much but wouldn’t a comfortable spring bed do them as well as a coffin?”"
"“棺材，”玛丽·简说，“是用来提醒他们要想着自己最终的结局。”","“The coffin,” said Mary Jane, “is to remind them of their last end.”"
"话题变得令人悒郁起来，所以最终归结于餐桌上的一阵沉默之中，在沉默中，人们能听到马林斯太太用一种分辨不清的压低了的声音对她的邻座说道：","As the subject had grown lugubrious it was buried in a silence of the table during which Mrs. Malins could be heard saying to her neighbour in an indistinct undertone:"
"“他们都是些大好人，那些修道士们，都是非常虔诚的人。”","“They are very good men, the monks, very pious men.”"
"葡萄干、杏仁、无花果、苹果、橘子、巧克力还有糖果在桌子上传递着，朱莉娅姨妈邀请所有的客人都来点波尔多葡萄酒或雪利酒。起初巴特尔·达西先生两种都拒绝了，可他的一位邻座用胳膊肘轻推他并低声对他耳语了些什么，然后他就让人把酒杯倒满了。渐渐地随着最后几个酒杯也一一盛满，谈话停了下来。接着是一阵停顿，只能听到喝酒的声音和椅子动来动去的声音。三位莫肯小姐，全都低头看着桌布。有人咳嗽了一两次，然后几位先生轻轻地拍拍桌子，示意大家安静。随即静了下来，加布里埃尔把椅子往后一推。","The raisins and almonds and figs and apples and oranges and chocolates and sweets were now passed about the table and Aunt Julia invited all the guests to have either port or sherry.At first Mr. Bartell D’Arcy refused to take either but one of his neighbours nudged him and whispered something to him upon which he allowed his glass to be filled.Gradually as the last glasses were being filled the conversation ceased.A pause followed, broken only by the noise of the wine and by unsettlings of chairs.The Misses Morkan, all three, looked down at the tablecloth.Someone coughed once or twice and then a few gentlemen patted the table gently as a signal for silence.The silence came and Gabriel pushed back his chair."
"拍桌子的声音立刻变得响亮起来以作为鼓励，然后一下子又都停了下来。加布里埃尔把十个颤抖的手指倚在桌布上，紧张地冲大伙微笑着。迎着一排仰起的脸，他抬眼看着枝形吊灯。钢琴正在弹奏一支华尔兹舞曲，他能听到裙裾扫过客厅大门的声音。人们也许正站在外面码头上的雪地里，向上凝视着这些亮着灯的窗户，聆听着这支华尔兹乐曲。那里的空气是纯净的。远处的公园里大雪压满了枝头。惠灵顿纪念碑戴着一顶闪亮的雪帽，在十五英亩的白色原野上向西闪耀着。","The patting at once grew louder in encouragement and then ceased altogether.Gabriel leaned his ten trembling fingers on the tablecloth and smiled nervously at the company.Meeting a row of upturned faces he raised his eyes to the chandelier.The piano was playing a waltz tune and he could hear the skirts sweeping against the drawing-room door.People, perhaps, were standing in the snow on the quay outside, gazing up at the lighted windows and listening to the waltz music.The air was pure there.In the distance lay the park where the trees were weighted with snow.The Wellington Monument wore a gleaming cap of snow that flashed westward over the white field of Fifteen Acres."
"他开始了：","He began:"
"“女士们，先生们，","“Ladies and Gentlemen,"
"今晚命定应由我，正如在过去许多年中一样，来执行一项非常令人高兴的任务，但是恐怕我的拙劣才能不足以胜任这项任务。”","It has fallen to my lot this evening, as in years past, to perform a very pleasing task but a task for which I am afraid my poor powers as a speaker are all too inadequate.”"
"“不，不会！”布朗先生说。","“No, no!” said Mr. Browne."
"“但是，无论情况会如何，今晚我只能请求大家把我的心意看作是我的行动，请把你们的注意力借给我几分钟，我将努力用言辞来向你们表达在这个场合中我的所感所想。”","""But, however that may be, I can only ask you tonight to take the will for the deed and to lend me your attention for a few moments while I endeavour to express to you in words what my feelings are on this occasion."
"“女士们，先生们，这并非第一次我们聚集在这个热情好客的屋檐之下，围坐在这张丰盛的餐桌旁。这并非我们第一次作为领受者——或者也许，我最好说，是受害者——来承受几位好心女士的热情款待。”","“Ladies and Gentlemen, it is not the first time that we have gathered together under this hospitable roof, around this hospitable board.It is not the first time that we have been the recipients—or perhaps, I had better say, the victims—of the hospitality of certain good ladies.”"
"他用胳膊在空中划了个圆圈，然后停顿了一下。所有的人都大笑或微笑着看着凯特姨妈还有朱莉娅姨妈还有玛丽·简，她们全都由于高兴而满脸通红。加布里埃尔更加大胆地继续说道：","He made a circle in the air with his arm and paused.Everyone laughed or smiled at Aunt Kate and Aunt Julia and Mary Jane who all turned crimson with pleasure.Gabriel went on more boldly:"
"“一年又一年我越来越强烈地感受到，我们的国家没有任何传统会比它热情好客的传统更能给它带来荣誉，并更应该小心维护。就我的经历而言（我去过不少国外的地方），在现代民族中，这是一种独特的传统。也许有人会说，这种传统只是我们的一种缺点，而决不是什么可以引以为豪的东西。但是，即便如此，在我看来，它也是一种高贵的缺点，一种我相信会继续在我们中间长久地加以培植的缺点。至少有一点，我是确信无疑的。只要这个屋檐还会为前面提到的几位好心的女士提供栖身之处——我从心底希望它会在未来的许多年继续这样做——那么这种真正热情有礼的爱尔兰式的热情好客，这种我们的先辈们留给我们而我们也必将留传给我们后代的传统，就会依旧活在我们中间。”","“I feel more strongly with every recurring year that our country has no tradition which does it so much honour and which it should guard so jealously as that of its hospitality.It is a tradition that is unique as far as my experience goes (and I have visited not a few places abroad) among the modern nations.Some would say, perhaps, that with us it is rather a failing than anything to be boasted of.But granted even that, it is, to my mind, a princely failing, and one that I trust will long be cultivated among us.Of one thing, at least, I am sure.As long as this one roof shelters the good ladies aforesaid—and I wish from my heart it may do so for many and many a long year to come—the tradition of genuine warm-hearted courteous Irish hospitality, which our forefathers have handed down to us and which we in turn must hand down to our descendants, is still alive among us.”"
"一阵表示衷心赞同的低语声在餐桌上传开了。加布里埃尔突然想起艾弗斯小姐不在这里，她已经有失礼貌地离开：于是他便自信满满地说道：","A hearty murmur of assent ran round the table.It shot through Gabriel’s mind that Miss Ivors was not there and that she had gone away discourteously: and he said with confidence in himself:"
"“女士们，先生们，","“Ladies and Gentlemen,"
"新的一代正在我们中间成长起来，这是受新观念和新原则激励的一代。他们严肃认真，对这些新观念充满热情，而他们的热情，即使被用错了地方，我相信，大体上仍是真诚的。但是我们正生活在一个充满怀疑，如果我可以使用这个词的话，一个思想经受折磨的时代：有时我会害怕这新的一代，受过教育的或者说实际上是受过了太多教育的，会缺乏过去的品质，即人道主义、热情好客以及那种善意的幽默。今晚听到所有那些过去伟大歌唱家的名字，我必须承认，我似乎觉得我们正生活在一个不太自由的时代。那些年代，毫不夸张地说，可以被称为是自由的年代：如果它们超越了记忆，那就让我们祈愿，至少，在像这样的聚会中，我们将会依旧满怀自豪和情感地谈论起它们，依旧在我们的心里珍藏对那些逝去之人的回忆，这个世界将永不会让他们的声名消亡。”","A new generation is growing up in our midst, a generation actuated by new ideas and new principles.It is serious and enthusiastic for these new ideas and its enthusiasm, even when it is misdirected, is, I believe, in the main sincere.But we are living in a sceptical and, if I may use the phrase, a thought-tormented age: and sometimes I fear that this new generation, educated or hypereducated as it is, will lack those qualities of humanity, of hospitality, of kindly humour which belonged to an older day.Listening tonight to the names of all those great singers of the past it seemed to me, I must confess, that we were living in a less spacious age.Those days might, without exaggeration, be called spacious days: and if they are gone beyond recall let us hope, at least, that in gatherings such as this we shall still speak of them with pride and affection, still cherish in our hearts the memory of those dead and gone great ones whose fame the world will not willingly let die.”"
"“听啊，听啊！”布朗先生大声地说。","“Hear, hear!” said Mr. Browne loudly."
"“可是，”加布里埃尔继续说道，他的声音降低了，变得较为轻柔，“在这样的聚会中总有一些比较悲伤的思绪会重现在我们的脑中：想起过去，想起青春，想起我们今晚在这里思念但却未能出现的那些容颜。我们的人生路撒满了许多这样的悲伤记忆：如果我们总是黯然回想它们，那么我们将无法找到勇气在生者当中继续勇敢地工作下去。我们所有的人都有生者的责任和生者的情感，这就要求，而且是正当地要求，我们付出辛苦的努力。","“But yet,” continued Gabriel, his voice falling into a softer inflection, “there are always in gatherings such as this sadder thoughts that will recur to our minds: thoughts of the past, of youth, of changes, of absent faces that we miss here tonight.Our path through life is strewn with many such sad memories: and were we to brood upon them always we could not find the heart to go on bravely with our work among the living.We have all of us living duties and living affections which claim, and rightly claim, our strenuous endeavours."
"因此，我不会执着于过去。我不会让任何忧郁的道德说教今晚在这里搅扰我们。在这里，我们聚集一堂，远离世俗生活的喧嚣和忙碌。我们相会于此，本着相互帮助的友好精神，在某种程度上还本着真正志同道合的精神，我们就是朋友和同事，此外我们还是她们的客人——我该称呼她们什么呢？——都柏林音乐界的美惠三女神。”","Therefore, I will not linger on the past.I will not let any gloomy moralising intrude upon us here tonight.Here we are gathered together for a brief moment from the bustle and rush of our everyday routine.We are met here as friends, in the spirit of good-fellowship, as colleagues, also to a certain extent, in the true spirit of camaraderie, and as the guests of—what shall I call them?—the Three Graces of the Dublin musical world.”"
"听到这个典故，餐桌上爆发出了掌声和笑声。朱莉娅姨妈赶紧问她的邻座们加布里埃尔说了什么，但却徒劳无获。","The table burst into applause and laughter at this allusion.Aunt Julia vainly asked each of her neighbours in turn to tell her what Gabriel had said."
"“他说我们是美惠三女神，朱莉娅姨妈。”玛丽·简说。","“He says we are the Three Graces, Aunt Julia,” said Mary Jane."
"朱莉娅姨妈没听明白，不过她却抬起头，微笑着看着加布里埃尔，他用同样的语调继续说道：","Aunt Julia did not understand but she looked up, smiling, at Gabriel, who continued in the same vein:"
"“女士们，先生们，","“Ladies and Gentlemen,"
"今晚我不会努力去扮演帕里斯在另一个场合中扮演过的那个角色。我不会试图在她们中间做出选择。这个任务容易招人嫉恨，也超出了我那可怜的权限。因为当我依次朝她们看去，无论是我们的首席女主人本人——她那颗善心，她那颗再好不过的善心，已经成为所有认识她的人所熟知的一个代名词——还是她的姐姐，她似乎被赋予了永恒的青春，今晚她的演唱对我们所有的人来说都是一种惊喜和一种救赎，还是，最后但却同样重要的，当我想到我们最年轻的女主人，富有才华，生性乐观，勤劳敬业，世上最优秀的侄女，坦率地说，女士们先生们，我真不知道我应该把这份荣誉授予哪一位。“","I will not attempt to play tonight the part that Paris played on another occasion.I will not attempt to choose between them.The task would be an invidious one and one beyond my poor powers.For when I view them in turn, whether it be our chief hostess herself, whose good heart, whose too good heart, has become a byword with all who know her, or her sister, who seems to be gifted with perennial youth and whose singing must have been a surprise and a revelation to us all tonight, or, last but not least, when I consider our youngest hostess, talented, cheerful, hard-working and the best of nieces, I confess, Ladies and Gentlemen, that I do not know to which of them I should award the prize.”"
"加布里埃尔低头瞥了一眼他的两位姨妈，看见了朱莉娅姨妈脸上绽放着的微笑以及凯特姨妈眼睛里充盈的泪水，于是他便赶快收尾。他殷勤地举起他那杯波特葡萄酒，而在场的每个人也都期待地用手指触着酒杯，他大声说道：","Gabriel glanced down at his aunts and, seeing the large smile on Aunt Julia’s face and the tears which had risen to Aunt Kate’s eyes, hastened to his close.He raised his glass of port gallantly, while every member of the company fingered a glass expectantly, and said loudly:"
"“让我们一起为她们三位干杯吧。让我们干杯吧，为她们的健康、财富、长寿、幸福和富足，祝愿她们继续长久地保有她们在各自的职业中凭借自己的力量赢得的那个引以为豪的位置，也祝愿她们继续长久地保有她们在我们的心目中所占据的那个备受尊敬和爱戴的位置。”","“Let us toast them all three together.Let us drink to their health, wealth, long life, happiness and prosperity and may they long continue to hold the proud and self-won position which they hold in their profession and the position of honour and affection which they hold in our hearts.”"
"所有的客人都站了起来，手里举着酒杯，转向那三位坐着的女士，由布朗先生领头，齐声唱了起来：","All the guests stood up, glass in hand, and turning towards the three seated ladies, sang in unison, with Mr. Browne as leader:"
"因为她们是快活的好人，因为她们是快活的好人，因为她们是快活的好人，这一点无人能够否认。","For they are jolly gay fellows, For they are jolly gay fellows, For they are jolly gay fellows, Which nobody can deny."
"凯特姨妈索性用起了手绢，就连朱莉娅姨妈也似乎被感动了。弗雷迪·马林斯用布丁叉敲着节拍，唱歌的人们互相面对面，仿佛置身于音乐会，他们起劲地唱着：","Aunt Kate was making frank use of her handkerchief and even Aunt Julia seemed moved.Freddy Malins beat time with his pudding-fork and the singers turned towards one another, as if in melodious conference, while they sang with emphasis:"
"除非他说谎，除非他说谎。","Unless he tells a lie, Unless he tells a lie,"
"然后，他们再次转向他们的几位女主人，唱道：","Then, turning once more towards their hostesses, they sang:"
"因为她们是快活的伙伴，因为她们是快活的伙伴，因为她们是快活的伙伴，这一点无人能够否认。","For they are jolly gay fellows, For they are jolly gay fellows, For they are jolly gay fellows, Which nobody can deny."
"继之而起的欢呼声被晚餐室门外的许多其他客人接续着，一次又一次地重复着，弗雷迪·马林斯高举着叉子充当着指挥的角色。","The acclamation which followed was taken up beyond the door of the supper-room by many of the other guests and renewed time after time, Freddy Malins acting as officer with his fork on high."
"清晨刺骨的寒风吹进了他们所站的大厅，于是凯特姨妈说：","The piercing morning air came into the hall where they were standing so that Aunt Kate said:"
"“谁来把门关上吧。马林斯太太会得上要命的感冒的。”","“Close the door, somebody.Mrs. Malins will get her death of cold.”"
"“布朗在外面呢，凯特姨妈。”玛丽·简说。","“Browne is out there, Aunt Kate,” said Mary Jane."
"“布朗真是无处不在啊。”凯特姨妈压低了声音说道。","“Browne is everywhere,” said Aunt Kate, lowering her voice."
"玛丽·简嘲笑着她的语气。","Mary Jane laughed at her tone."
"“的确，”她调皮地说，“他真是无微不至。”","“Really,” she said archly, “he is very attentive.”"
"“他在这里俨然就像是煤气灯，”凯特姨妈用同样的语气说道，“整个圣诞节期间都是如此。”","“He has been laid on here like the gas,” said Aunt Kate in the same tone, “all during the Christmas.”"
"这一次她自己也开心地笑了起来，然后迅即补充道：","She laughed herself this time good-humouredly and then added quickly:"
"“不过还是叫他进来吧，玛丽·简，然后关上门。我希望上天保佑他没有听到我说的话。”","“But tell him to come in, Mary Jane, and close the door.I hope to goodness he didn’t hear me.”"
"就在这时，客厅的门打开了，布朗先生从门阶处走了进来，他大笑着，仿佛心都要笑碎了。他穿着一件绿色的长外套，袖口和领子都是仿羊皮的毛边，他的头上戴着一顶椭圆形的皮帽。他手指着积雪覆盖的码头，从那里传来了尖厉悠长的鸣笛声。","At that moment the hall-door was opened and Mr. Browne came in from the doorstep, laughing as if his heart would break.He was dressed in a long green overcoat with mock astrakhan cuffs and collar and wore on his head an oval fur cap.He pointed down the snow-covered quay from where the sound of shrill prolonged whistling was borne in."
"“特迪会把都柏林所有的出租马车都叫出来的。”他说。","“Teddy will have all the cabs in Dublin out,” he said."
"加布里埃尔从厨房后面的小配餐室走上前来，费劲地穿上外套，然后转身环顾一下客厅，说道：","Gabriel advanced from the little pantry behind the office, struggling into his overcoat and, looking round the hall, said:"
"“格雷塔还没下来吗？”","“Gretta not down yet?”"
"“她正在收拾她的东西，加布里埃尔。”凯特姨妈说。","“She’s getting on her things, Gabriel,” said Aunt Kate."
"“谁在楼上演奏呢？”加布里埃尔问道。","“Who’s playing up there?” asked Gabriel."
"“没有人呀。他们全都走了。”","“Nobody.They’re all gone.”"
"“哦，不，凯特姨妈，”玛丽·简说。“巴特尔·达西和奥卡拉汉小姐都还没走呢。”","“O no, Aunt Kate,” said Mary Jane.“Bartell D‘Arcy and Miss O’Callaghan aren’t gone yet.”"
"“不管怎么说，有人正在那儿乱弹钢琴呢。”加布里埃尔说。","“Someone is fooling at the piano anyhow,” said Gabriel."
"玛丽·简瞥了一眼加布里埃尔和布朗先生，身体哆嗦了一下说道：","Mary Jane glanced at Gabriel and Mr. Browne and said with a shiver:"
"“看着你们两位先生包裹成这样就让我觉得冷。我真不愿意面对你们在这样一个时间回家的那段路程。”","“It makes me feel cold to look at you two gentlemen muffled up like that.I wouldn’t like to face your journey home at this hour.”"
"“此刻我什么都不想要，”布朗先生豪气十足地说，“就想在乡间来一次特别惬意的散步，或者是轻车快马地来一次疾驶。”","“I’d like nothing better this minute,” said Mr. Browne stoutly, “than a rattling fine walk in the country or a fast drive with a good spanking goer between the shafts.”"
"“我们家过去曾有过一辆非常好的单马双轮轻便马车。”朱莉娅姨妈伤感地说道。","“We used to have a very good horse and trap at home,” said Aunt Julia sadly."
"“永远都无法忘怀的约翰尼。”玛丽·简大笑着说。","“The never-to-be-forgotten Johnny,” said Mary Jane, laughing."
"凯特姨妈和加布里埃尔也都大笑了起来。","Aunt Kate and Gabriel laughed too."
"“怎么了，约翰尼有什么奇妙的地方吗？”布朗先生问。","“Why, what was wonderful about Johnny?” asked Mr. Browne."
"“故世的帕特里克·莫肯，也就是我们的祖父，”加布里埃尔解释道，“晚年以老先生的名号而为众人所知，他是一个熬胶匠。”","“The late lamented Patrick Morkan, our grandfather, that is,” explained Gabriel, “commonly known in his later years as the old gentleman, was a glue-boiler.”"
"“哦，好了，加布里埃尔，”凯特姨妈大笑着说，“他经营的的是一间淀粉磨坊。”","“O, now, Gabriel,” said Aunt Kate, laughing, “he had a starch mill.”"
"“好了，不管是胶还是淀粉，”加布里埃尔说，“老先生有一匹马，名叫约翰尼。约翰尼常在老先生的磨坊里干活儿，一圈一圈地拉磨。一切都非常好；可现在该讲约翰尼的悲惨故事了。在一个晴朗的日子，老先生想要和上流人士们一道驾车去公园里看一场阅兵式。”","“Well, glue or starch,” said Gabriel, “the old gentleman had a horse by the name of Johnny.And Johnny used to work in the old gentleman’s mill, walking round and round in order to drive the mill.That was all very well; but now comes the tragic part about Johnny.One fine day the old gentleman thought he’d like to drive out with the quality to a military review in the park.”"
"“愿主怜悯他的灵魂。”凯特姨妈同情地说。","“The Lord have mercy on his soul,” said Aunt Kate compassionately."
"“阿门，”加布里埃尔说，“于是老先生，正如我说过的那样，就把约翰尼套到马车上，戴上自己最好的高礼帽以及最好的硬领结，然后就有模有样地驾车驶出了祖屋，我想那祖屋是在后巷上的某个地方吧。”","“Amen,” said Gabriel.“So the old gentleman, as I said, harnessed Johnny and put on his very best tall hat and his very best stock collar and drove out in grand style from his ancestral mansion somewhere near Back Lane, I think.”"
"每个人，甚至连马林斯太太，都被加布里埃尔的样子逗笑了，凯特姨妈说：","Everyone laughed, even Mrs. Malins, at Gabriel’s manner and Aunt Kate said:"
"“哦，好了，加布里埃尔，他其实并不住在后巷。只是磨坊在那里。”","“O, now, Gabriel, he didn’t live in Back Lane, really.Only the mill was there.”"
"“驶出了先辈们留下的屋子，”加布里埃尔继续说道，“他驱赶着约翰尼往前走。一切都进行得很完美，直到约翰尼看见了国王比利的塑像：也许是他喜欢上了国王比利骑着的那匹马或者也许是他认为他又回到了磨坊，不管怎么说，他开始绕着那尊塑像转起圈来。”","“Out from the mansion of his forefathers,” continued Gabriel, “he drove with Johnny.And everything went on beautifully until Johnny came in sight of King Billy’s statue: and whether he fell in love with the horse King Billy sits on or whether he thought he was back again in the mill, anyhow he began to walk round the statue.”"
"加布里埃尔穿着高统雨靴在其他人的一片笑声中绕着客厅踱了一圈。","Gabriel paced in a circle round the hall in his goloshes amid the laughter of the others."
"“他一圈接一圈地走啊走啊，”加布里埃尔说，“老先生呢，是一位很自负的老先生，他气愤至极。‘继续走呀，先生！您这是什么意思，先生？约翰尼！约翰尼！这种行为真是太出格了！真搞不明白这匹马！’”","“Round and round he went,” said Gabriel, “and the old gentleman, who was a very pompous old gentleman, was highly indignant.‘Go on, sir!What do you mean, sir?Johnny! Johnny!Most extraordinary conduct!Can’t understand the horse!’”"
"加布里埃尔对这起事件生动形象的讲述引得大家哄堂大笑，但这笑声却被厅门上传来的一阵响亮的敲门声打断了。玛丽·简跑去开门，让进来了弗雷迪·马林斯。弗雷迪·马林斯头上的帽子戴得很靠后脑，双肩冷得紧缩着，正费劲地呼哧呼哧吐着气。","The peal of laughter which followed Gabriel’s imitation of the incident was interrupted by a resounding knock at the hall door.Mary Jane ran to open it and let in Freddy Malins.Freddy Malins, with his hat well back on his head and his shoulders humped with cold, was puffing and steaming after his exertions."
"“我只能找到一辆出租马车。”他说。","“I could only get one cab,” he said."
"“哦，我们会在码头上沿路再找到一辆的。”","“O, we’ll find another along the quay,” said Gabriel."
"“会的，”凯特姨妈说，“最好不要让马林斯太太站在风口上。”","“Yes,” said Aunt Kate.“Better not keep Mrs. Malins standing in the draught.”"
"马林斯太太由儿子和布朗先生帮扶着走下门前的台阶，然后费了好多周折之后才被扶进了马车。弗雷迪·马林斯跟着也费劲地爬进了马车，然后又花了好长时间把她安顿在座位上，布朗先生则一直帮着他出主意。终于，她被舒舒服服地安顿好了，弗雷迪·马林斯邀请布朗先生也上车。在好一阵含混不清的交谈之后，布朗先生才上了马车。车夫把毯子铺在膝盖上，弯下身去问地址。这下子更乱了，弗雷迪·马林斯和布朗先生把头分别从马车的一个窗户伸出去，给车夫说着不同的方向。难点在于要搞清楚沿路在什么地方把布朗先生放下，凯特姨妈、朱莉娅姨妈和玛丽·简在门阶那儿帮着商议着，她们说着互相矛盾的建议，笑声不断。至于弗雷迪·马林斯，他都笑得说不出话来了。他一会儿把头缩回去，一会儿又把头从窗户里探出来，使得他的帽子不断遭遇危险。他告诉母亲讨论进展得怎么样，直到最后布朗先生在大家的一片哄哄嚷嚷的大笑声中冲着困惑的车夫喊道：","Mrs. Malins was helped down the front steps by her son and Mr. Browne and, after many manoeuvres, hoisted into the cab.Freddy Malins clambered in after her and spent a long time settling her on the seat, Mr. Browne helping him with advice.At last she was settled comfortably and Freddy Malins invited Mr. Browne into the cab.There was a good deal of confused talk, and then Mr. Browne got into the cab.The cabman settled his rug over his knees, and bent down for the address.The confusion grew greater and the cabman was directed differently by Freddy Malins and Mr. Browne, each of whom had his head out through a window of the cab.The difficulty was to know where to drop Mr. Browne along the route, and Aunt Kate, Aunt Julia and Mary Jane helped the discussion from the doorstep with cross-directions and contradictions and abundance of laughter.As for Freddy Malins he was speechless with laughter.He popped his head in and out of the window every moment to the great danger of his hat, and told his mother how the discussion was progressing, till at last Mr. Browne shouted to the bewildered cabman above the din of everybody’s laughter:"
"“你知道三一学院吗？”","“Do you know Trinity College?”"
"“知道，先生。”车夫说。","“Yes, sir,” said the cabman."
"“那好，先往三一学院门口走吧，”布朗先生说，“然后我们再告你去哪里。你现在明白了吗？”","“Well, drive bang up against Trinity College gates,” said Mr. Browne, “and then we’ll tell you where to go. You understand now?”"
"“是的，先生。”车夫说。","“Yes, sir,” said the cabman."
"“那就像鸟一样飞往三一学院吧。”","“Make like a bird for Trinity College.”"
"“好嘞，先生。”车夫说。","“Right, sir,” said the cabman."
"在一片笑声和道别声中，马儿在鞭策之下走了起来，马车沿着码头疾驰而去。","The horse was whipped up and the cab rattled off along the quay amid a chorus of laughter and adieus."
"加布里埃尔没有和其他人一起到门口。他呆在客厅的暗处，朝上凝视着楼梯。一个女人正站在第一段楼梯靠近顶部的地方，也是在阴影里。他看不见她的脸，但是他却能看见她那条裙子赤褐与红粉相间的裙边，在阴影里那颜色看上去就像是黑白相间。那是他的妻子。她正倚靠在扶手上，侧耳倾听着什么。加布里埃尔对她那一动不动的样子感到惊讶，就也支楞起耳朵倾听起来。可是他几乎听不到什么，只有嘈杂的笑声和门前台阶上的争论声，还有钢琴上奏出的几个音符和一个男人吟唱的几句。","Gabriel had not gone to the door with the others.He was in a dark part of the hall gazing up the staircase.A woman was standing near the top of the first flight, in the shadow also.He could not see her face but he could see the terra-cotta and salmon-pink panels of her skirt which the shadow made appear black and white.It was his wife.She was leaning on the banisters, listening to something.Gabriel was surprised at her stillness and strained his ear to listen also.But he could hear little save the noise of laughter and dispute on the front steps, a few chords struck on the piano and a few notes of a man’s voice singing."
"他一动不动地站在昏暗的客厅里，一边努力辨识着那声音正在吟唱的调子，一边抬头凝视着妻子。她的神态优雅而神秘，仿佛某物的象征。他自问道，一个站在楼梯阴影里倾听着远处音乐的女人，会是什么的象征。如果他是个画家，他一定会画下她处在那种神态中的样子。她那蓝色的毡帽会在昏暗背景下凸显出她头发的古铜色，她那裙边的深色部分则会凸显出浅色的部分。他会给这幅画起名为《远处的乐声》，如果他是一个画家的话。","He stood still in the gloom of the hall, trying to catch the air that the voice was singing and gazing up at his wife.There was grace and mystery in her attitude as if she were a symbol of something.He asked himself what is a woman standing on the stairs in the shadow, listening to distant music, a symbol of.If he were a painter he would paint her in that attitude.Her blue felt hat would show off the bronze of her hair against the darkness and the dark panels of her skirt would show off the light ones.Distant Music he would call the picture if he were a painter."
"厅门关上了；凯特姨妈、朱莉娅姨妈和玛丽·简沿着客厅走了过来，依然大笑着。","The hall-door was closed; and Aunt Kate, Aunt Julia and Mary Jane came down the hall, still laughing."
"“呃，弗雷迪难道不讨厌吗？”玛丽·简说，“他的确很讨厌。”","“Well, isn’t Freddy terrible?” said Mary Jane.“He’s really terrible.”"
"加布里埃尔什么都没说，但却朝楼上他妻子站立的地方指了指。现在厅门关上了，歌声和琴声都能听得更清楚些。加布里埃尔举手示意他们安静。那首歌似乎像是古爱尔兰歌谣的那种调子，唱歌的人则似乎对自己的吐字和嗓音都拿捏不定。由于距离的缘故，也由于歌者声音沙哑的缘故，那歌声听来哀怨动人，隐约诠释出了那小调的韵律，歌词表达着悲伤之情：","Gabriel said nothing but pointed up the stairs towards where his wife was standing.Now that the hall-door was closed the voice and the piano could be heard more clearly.Gabriel held up his hand for them to be silent.The song seemed to be in the old Irish tonality and the singer seemed uncertain both of his words and of his voice.The voice, made plaintive by distance and by the singer’s hoarseness, faintly illuminated the cadence of the air with words expressing grief:"
"哦，雨水落在我浓密的卷发，露珠浸湿了我的皮肤，我的宝贝冰冷地躺着……","O, the rain falls on my heavy locks And the dew wets my skin, My babe lies cold..."
"“啊，”玛丽·简惊叫道，“那是巴特尔·达西在唱歌，他整个晚上都不愿意唱歌。哦，我要让他在走之前再唱一首歌。”","“O,” exclaimed Mary Jane.“It’s Bartell D’Arcy singing and he wouldn’t sing all the night.O, I’ll get him to sing a song before he goes.”"
"“哦，去吧，玛丽·简。”凯特姨妈说。","“O, do, Mary Jane,” said Aunt Kate."
"玛丽·简从其他人身边擦身而过，朝楼梯跑去，但是她还没跑到楼梯，歌声停止了，钢琴声也戛然而止。","Mary Jane brushed past the others and ran to the staircase, but before she reached it the singing stopped and the piano was closed abruptly."
"“哦，真遗憾！”她叫道，“他要下来了吗，格雷塔？”","“O, what a pity!” she cried.“Is he coming down, Gretta?”"
"加布里埃尔听见他妻子回答说是的，然后看见她下楼朝他们走过来。在她身后隔着几步远是巴特尔·达西先生和奥卡拉汉小姐。","Gabriel heard his wife answer yes and saw her come down towards them.A few steps behind her were Mr. Bartell D‘Arcy and Miss O’Callaghan."
"“哦，达西先生，”玛丽·简叫道，“您真是太吝啬了，我们刚刚正满心欢喜地听您唱歌，您却就那样突然不唱了。”","“O, Mr. D’Arcy,” cried Mary Jane, “it’s downright mean of you to break off like that when we were all in raptures listening to you.”"
"“我整个晚上都一直在鼓动他，”奥卡拉汉小姐说，“康罗伊太太也一样，可他却告诉我们说他得了可怕的感冒，所以不能唱。”","“I have been at him all the evening,” said Miss O’Callaghan, “and Mrs. Conroy, too, and he told us he had a dreadful cold and couldn’t sing.”"
"“哦，达西先生，”凯特姨妈说，“这谎可说大了吧。”","“O, Mr. D’Arcy,” said Aunt Kate, “now that was a great fib to tell.”"
"“难道你们听不出我的嗓子沙哑得像只乌鸦吗？”达西先生粗鲁地说。","“Can’t you see that I‘m as hoarse as a crow?” said Mr. D’Arcy roughly."
"他匆匆走近配餐室穿上大衣。其他人都被他粗鲁的言辞震惊了，一下子找不到什么话可说。凯特姨妈皱起了眉头，示意其他人停止这个话题。达西先生在那儿仔细地包裹着脖子，皱着眉头。","He went into the pantry hastily and put on his overcoat.The others, taken aback by his rude speech, could find nothing to say.Aunt Kate wrinkled her brows and made signs to the others to drop the subject.Mr. D’Arcy stood swathing his neck carefully and frowning."
"“是天气的缘故。”停顿了一会儿之后朱莉娅姨妈说。","“It’s the weather,” said Aunt Julia, after a pause."
"“是的，所有的人都感冒了，”凯特姨妈立刻说道，“所有人。”","“Yes, everybody has colds,” said Aunt Kate readily, “everybody.”"
"“他们说，”玛丽·简说，“我们已经有三十年没见过这样的雪了；今天早上我看到报纸上说这场雪波及了整个爱尔兰。”","“They say,” said Mary Jane, “we haven’t had snow like it for thirty years; and I read this morning in the newspapers that the snow is general all over Ireland.”"
"“我喜欢下雪的情景。”朱莉娅姨妈悲伤地说。","“I love the look of snow,” said Aunt Julia sadly."
"“我也是，”奥卡拉汉小姐说，“如果我们在地上看不到雪的话，圣诞节就不像真正的圣诞节了。”","“So do I,” said Miss O’Callaghan.“I think Christmas is never really Christmas unless we have the snow on the ground.”"
"“但是可怜的达西先生可不喜欢雪。”凯特姨妈微笑着说。","“But poor Mr. D’Arcy doesn’t like the snow,” said Aunt Kate, smiling."
"达西先生从配餐室出来，浑身包裹得严严实实，扣子也都扣得好好的，他用一种表示悔悟的语调给他们讲述了自己患感冒的经过。所有的人都给他提建议，说真是太可怜了，并都极力提醒他在晚上一定要特别呵护好自己的喉咙。加布里埃尔注视着自己的妻子，她没有加入到谈话中来。她正好站在灰尘满布的气窗下，煤气灯的火苗照亮了她那浓密的古铜色头发，几天前他曾见她在壁炉前烘干过。她还是同样的神态，似乎没有察觉到她身边的这场谈话。终于她转过身来面朝他们，加布里埃尔看见她的双颊泛着红晕，她的双眼闪着亮光。一种突然涌起的喜悦从他的心里迸发出来。","Mr. D’Arcy came from the pantry, fully swathed and buttoned, and in a repentant tone told them the history of his cold.Everyone gave him advice and said it was a great pity and urged him to be very careful of his throat in the night air.Gabriel watched his wife, who did not join in the conversation.She was standing right under the dusty fanlight and the flame of the gas lit up the rich bronze of her hair, which he had seen her drying at the fire a few days before.She was in the same attitude and seemed unaware of the talk about her.At last she turned towards them and Gabriel saw that there was colour on her cheeks and that her eyes were shining.A sudden tide of joy went leaping out of his heart."
"“达西先生，”她说，“您刚才唱的那首歌的歌名叫什么？”","“Mr. D’Arcy,” she said, “what is the name of that song you were singing?”"
"“它叫《奥赫里姆的少女》，”达西先生说，“我记不太清了。怎么了？你知道这首歌吗？”","“It’s called The Lass of Aughrim,” said Mr. D’Arcy, “but I couldn’t remember it properly.Why? Do you know it?”"
"“《奥赫里姆的少女》，”她重复着，“我不记得这个歌名。”","“The Lass of Aughrim,” she repeated.“I couldn’t think of the name.”"
"“这是一首非常好听的小曲，”玛丽·简说，“很遗憾今晚您的嗓子不舒服。”","“It’s a very nice air,” said Mary Jane.“I’m sorry you were not in voice tonight.”"
"“好了，玛丽·简，”凯特姨妈说，“别再惹达西先生烦心了。我不想让他受到烦扰。”","“Now, Mary Jane,” said Aunt Kate, “don’t annoy Mr. D’Arcy.I won’t have him annoyed.”"
"见所有的人都已做好动身的准备，她便引领着他们来到门口，彼此互道晚安：","Seeing that all were ready to start she shepherded them to the door, where good-night was said:"
"“好了，晚安，凯特姨妈，谢谢您，多么美好的夜晚。”","“Well, good-night, Aunt Kate, and thanks for the pleasant evening.”"
"“晚安，加布里埃尔。晚安，格雷塔！”","“Good-night, Gabriel.Good-night, Gretta!”"
"“晚安，凯特姨妈，非常非常感谢。晚安，朱莉娅姨妈。”","“Good-night, Aunt Kate, and thanks ever so much.Goodnight, Aunt Julia.”"
"“哦，晚安，格雷塔，我刚才没看见你。”","“O, good-night, Gretta, I didn’t see you.”"
"“晚安，达西先生。晚安，奥卡拉汉小姐。”","“Good-night, Mr. D’Arcy.Good-night, Miss O’Callaghan.”"
"“晚安，莫肯小姐。”","“Good-night, Miss Morkan.”"
"“再次祝您晚安。”","“Good-night, again.”"
"“大家全都晚安。一路平安。”","“Good-night, all.Safe home.”"
"“晚安。晚安。”","“Good-night.Good night.”"
"清晨的天色仍旧是昏暗的。一种黯然昏黄的光线笼罩着房屋和河流；天空似乎要坠下来的样子。脚下满是雪泥；只有一条条一块块的雪覆盖在屋顶上，覆盖在码头的挡墙上，覆盖在庭院的围栏上。路灯在昏暗的空气中发出红色的光，河对岸四法院的宫殿在沉沉的天空下巍然矗立。","The morning was still dark.A dull, yellow light brooded over the houses and the river; and the sky seemed to be descending.It was slushy underfoot; and only streaks and patches of snow lay on the roofs, on the parapets of the quay and on the area railings.The lamps were still burning redly in the murky air and, across the river, the palace of the Four Courts stood out menacingly against the heavy sky."
"她跟巴特尔·达西先生一起走在他的前面，她的鞋子裹在棕色的包裹里，夹在腋下。她用手提着裙子，以免沾到污泥。她已经没有了刚才优雅的样子，但是加布里埃尔的双眼仍然因为喜悦而放着光彩。血液在他的血管里跳跃，各种念头在他脑子里骚动不安：骄傲，欢乐，温柔以及勇敢。","She was walking on before him with Mr. Bartell D’Arcy, her shoes in a brown parcel tucked under one arm and her hands holding her skirt up from the slush.She had no longer any grace of attitude, but Gabriel’s eyes were still bright with happiness.The blood went bounding along his veins; and the thoughts went rioting through his brain, proud, joyful, tender, valorous."
"她在前面走得那么轻快、笔直，以至于他想悄无声息地追上前去，抱住她的肩膀，在她耳边说些愚蠢又深情的话语。她看起来那么柔弱，他希望能为她抵挡一切，希望能跟她单独相处。他们两人私密的生活像星星一样在他记忆中闪烁着。淡紫色的信封静静躺在他早餐茶杯的旁边，他用手轻柔地抚摸着它。鸟儿在长春藤中欢唱，窗帘后面射进来的阳光在地板上闪耀，他因为无比的幸福而无法进食。他们站在拥挤的站台上，他把一张票塞进她戴着手套的温暖的手掌里。他跟她一起站在寒风中，透过装有隔栅的窗户，看一个男人在烧得很旺的火炉旁做瓶子。天太冷了。她的脸离他很近，在寒气中散发出清香，突然，他对着那个男人喊道：","She was walking on before him so lightly and so erect that he longed to run after her noiselessly, catch her by the shoulders and say something foolish and affectionate into her ear.She seemed to him so frail that he longed to defend her against something and then to be alone with her.Moments of their secret life together burst like stars upon his memory.A heliotrope envelope was lying beside his breakfast-cup and he was caressing it with his hand.Birds were twittering in the ivy and the sunny web of the curtain was shimmering along the floor: he could not eat for happiness.They were standing on the crowded platform and he was placing a ticket inside the warm palm of her glove.He was standing with her in the cold, looking in through a grated window at a man making bottles in a roaring furnace.It was very cold.Her face, fragrant in the cold air, was quite close to his; and suddenly he called out to the man at the furnace:"
"“火很热吗，先生？”","“Is the fire hot, sir?”"
"但是那个男人由于火炉发出的噪声却听不到他的话。这样也好。就算回答，他的态度大概也是粗鲁的。","But the man could not hear with the noise of the furnace.It was just as well.He might have answered rudely."
"一股更温柔的喜悦之情从他心头溢出，在血管中欢快地奔跑着。没有人知道，也不会有人知道，他们生命中这些如星火般闪耀的时刻点燃了他此刻的记忆。他想让她回忆起这些时光，忘掉那些无聊平淡的相处，只记得他们共度的欢乐的时刻。因为他觉得，岁月的洗礼没有熄灭他和她的灵魂。孩子，写作和家务还没有熄灭他和她灵魂中温柔的火焰。在当时他写给她的一封信中，他曾这样说过：“为什么像这样的话语在我看来是如此的单调而冷漠？是因为没有任何足够温柔的词语来形容你的名字吗？”","A wave of yet more tender joy escaped from his heart and went coursing in warm flood along his arteries.Like the tender fire of stars moments of their life together, that no one knew of or would ever know of, broke upon and illumined his memory.He longed to recall to her those moments, to make her forget the years of their dull existence together and remember only their moments of ecstasy.For the years, he felt, had not quenched his soul or hers.Their children, his writing, her household cares had not quenched all their souls’ tender fire.In one letter that he had written to her then he had said: “Why is it that words like these seem to me so dull and cold?Is it because there is no word tender enough to be your name?”"
"犹如远处的乐声一样，这些多年以前写下的话语现在正向他袭来。他渴望跟她单独相处。当别人都走开了，当他和她回到旅馆的房间，那时他们就可以独处了。他就可以温柔地喊她的名字：","Like distant music these words that he had written years before were borne towards him from the past.He longed to be alone with her.When the others had gone away, when he and she were in the room in the hotel, then they would be alone together.He would call her softly:"
"“格雷塔！”","“Gretta!”"
"也许她不会立刻听清他说了什么：她正在换衣服。但是他声音里的某种东西会打动她。她会转过身，望着他……","Perhaps she would not hear at once: she would be undressing.Then something in his voice would strike her.She would turn and look at him...."
"在瓦恩塔恩街的街角他们碰上了一辆出租马车。马车发出的隆隆声令他感到欣慰，这样他就不必说话了。她看着窗外，一副疲惫的样子。其他人只是指着外面的建筑或街道，偶尔说几句话。昏暗的天空下马匹疲倦地奔驰着，拉着陈旧的咯吱作响的车厢，而加布里埃尔又一次想起同她坐在一间车厢里，疾驰着去赶游船，疾驰着去度蜜月。","At the corner of Winetavern Street they met a cab.He was glad of its rattling noise as it saved him from conversation.She was looking out of the window and seemed tired.The others spoke only a few words, pointing out some building or street.The horse galloped along wearily under the murky morning sky, dragging his old rattling box after his heels, and Gabriel was again in a cab with her, galloping to catch the boat, galloping to their honeymoon."
"当马车驶过奥康奈尔桥的时候，奥卡拉汉小姐说：","As the cab drove across O‘Connell Bridge Miss O’Callaghan said:"
"“听说过奥康奈尔桥的时候总能看见一匹白马。”","“They say you never cross O’Connell Bridge without seeing a white horse.”"
"“这一次我看见了一个白人。”加布里埃尔说。","“I see a white man this time,” said Gabriel."
"“在哪儿？”巴特尔·达西先生问。","“Where?” asked Mr. Bartell D’Arcy."
"加布里埃尔指着那尊塑像，上面落满了一块一块的积雪。然后他亲密地冲那塑像点了点头，挥了挥手。","Gabriel pointed to the statue, on which lay patches of snow.Then he nodded familiarly to it and waved his hand."
"“晚安，丹。”他快乐地说。","“Good-night, Dan,” he said gaily."
"马车在旅馆门口停了下来，加布里埃尔跳下车，不顾巴特尔·达西先生的反对，付钱给了车夫。他在车费之外多给了车夫一个先令。车夫行礼说道：","When the cab drew up before the hotel, Gabriel jumped out and, in spite of Mr. Bartell D’Arcy’s protest, paid the driver.He gave the man a shilling over his fare.The man saluted and said:"
"“祝您新年发财，先生。”","“A prosperous New Year to you, sir.”"
"“同样祝福你。”加布里埃尔真诚地说。","“The same to you,” said Gabriel cordially."
"她下车的时候在他的胳膊上倚了片刻，然后站在路沿上向其他人道晚安。她轻柔地倚着他的胳膊，正如几个小时以前她和他跳舞时那般轻柔。当时他感觉自豪而幸福，幸福的是她是属于他的，自豪的是她举止优雅而贤淑。可是现在，在重温了这么多的回忆之后，刚一触碰到她的身体，它是那么富有韵律，那么新奇而芳香，一股急切而痛苦的欲望传遍了他的全身。在她沉默的外表之下，他把她的胳膊紧紧靠在自己的一侧身体上；他们站在旅馆门口，他感觉他们逃离了生活和责任，逃离了家庭和朋友，怀着狂野而热情的心一起逃走，开始一次新的冒险。","She leaned for a moment on his arm in getting out of the cab and while standing at the curbstone, bidding the others good-night.She leaned lightly on his arm, as lightly as when she had danced with him a few hours before.He had felt proud and happy then, happy that she was his, proud of her grace and wifely carriage.But now, after the kindling again of so many memories, the first touch of her body, musical and strange and perfumed, sent through him a keen pang of lust.Under cover of her silence he pressed her arm closely to his side; and, as they stood at the hotel door, he felt that they had escaped from their lives and duties, escaped from home and friends and run away together with wild and radiant hearts to a new adventure."
"一个老人正坐在大厅里一把带遮罩的椅子上打盹。他到办公室点了一根蜡烛，然后给他们引着路朝楼梯走去。他们默默地跟着他，他们的脚轻轻地踩在铺着厚厚地毯的楼梯上。她跟在看门人的身后爬着楼梯，她的头低着，她纤弱的肩膀好像由于负重而弯缩着，她的裙子紧紧地裹在身上。他完全可以一把搂住她的臀部，抱着她不动，因为他的胳膊颤抖着，渴望能抓住她，全凭着指甲紧紧抠着手掌心才遏制住了他身体的这种狂野冲动。看门人在楼梯上停下来，稳了稳摇曳不定的烛光。他们也在他下面的楼梯上停了下来。沉默之中，加布里埃尔能够听到融化了的蜡烛滴落到托盘里的声音以及他自己的心脏触碰着肋骨的跳动声。","An old man was dozing in a great hooded chair in the hall.He lit a candle in the office and went before them to the stairs.They followed him in silence, their feet falling in soft thuds on the thickly carpeted stairs.She mounted the stairs behind the porter, her head bowed in the ascent, her frail shoulders curved as with a burden, her skirt girt tightly about her.He could have flung his arms about her hips and held her still, for his arms were trembling with desire to seize her and only the stress of his nails against the palms of his hands held the wild impulse of his body in check.The porter halted on the stairs to settle his guttering candle.They halted, too, on the steps below him.In the silence Gabriel could hear the falling of the molten wax into the tray and the thumping of his own heart against his ribs."
"看门人引着他们走过一条走廊，打开了一扇房门。然后他把摇曳不定的蜡烛放到一个梳妆台上，然后问他们需要早上几点来人叫他们。","The porter led them along a corridor and opened a door.Then he set his unstable candle down on a toilet-table and asked at what hour they were to be called in the morning."
"“八点。”加布里埃尔说。","“Eight,” said Gabriel."
"看门人指着电灯的开关，开始喃喃地道歉，但加布里埃尔打断了他。","The porter pointed to the tap of the electric-light and began a muttered apology, but Gabriel cut him short."
"“我们不需要什么灯光。我们有大街上照进来的光就足够了。而且我说，”他指着蜡烛补充道，“你也可以把那个漂亮物件拿走，就算是当回好人吧。”","“We don’t want any light.We have light enough from the street.And I say,” he added, pointing to the candle, “you might remove that handsome article, like a good man.”"
"看门人又拿起蜡烛，不过动作很慢，因为这种从未有过的提议让他感到很吃惊。然后他嘟囔着说了晚安就出去了。加布里埃尔锁上了房门。","The porter took up his candle again, but slowly, for he was surprised by such a novel idea.Then he mumbled good-night and went out.Gabriel shot the lock to."
"从街上照进来的一束灰蒙蒙的光线长长地从一个窗口一直斜射到门口。加布里埃尔把外套和帽子扔到沙发上，穿过房间朝窗边走去。他看着下面的街道，以便平复一下自己的情绪。然后他转身背对着光线斜靠在一个屉橱上。她已经脱掉了帽子和风衣，正站在一大面活动穿衣镜前，解着腰扣。加布里埃尔停顿了片刻，注视着她，然后说道：","A ghastly light from the street lamp lay in a long shaft from one window to the door.Gabriel threw his overcoat and hat on a couch and crossed the room towards the window.He looked down into the street in order that his emotion might calm a little.Then he turned and leaned against a chest of drawers with his back to the light.She had taken off her hat and cloak and was standing before a large swinging mirror, unhooking her waist.Gabriel paused for a few moments, watching her, and then said:"
"“格雷塔！”","“Gretta!”"
"她从镜子旁慢慢转过身来，沿着那束光线朝他走来。她的脸看上去严肃而疲惫，加布里埃尔一时竟不知该说些什么。不，现在还不是时候。","She turned away from the mirror slowly and walked along the shaft of light towards him.Her face looked so serious and weary that the words would not pass Gabriel’s lips.No, it was not the moment yet."
"“你看起来很累。”他说。","“You looked tired,” he said."
"“我是有点累。”她答道。","“I am a little,” she answered."
"“你没有生病或是感觉虚弱吧？”","“You don’t feel ill or weak?”"
"“没有，累了：仅此而已。”","“No, tired: that’s all.”"
"她走到窗边站在那里，看着外面。加布里埃尔又等了一会儿，然后担心怯懦马上就会战胜自己，于是他突然说道：","She went on to the window and stood there, looking out.Gabriel waited again and then, fearing that diffidence was about to conquer him, he said abruptly:"
"“顺便说一句，格雷塔！”","“By the way, Gretta!”"
"“什么事？”","“What is it?”"
"“你知道那个可怜的家伙马林斯吧？”他语速很快。","“You know that poor fellow Malins?” he said quickly."
"“知道。他怎么了？”","“Yes.What about him?”"
"“呃，可怜的家伙，毕竟他还算是个正直人。”加布里埃尔矫揉地继续说道。“他还了我借给他的那个金币，而我压根没想到他会还。真可惜，他不能远离那个布朗，因为他不是个坏人，真的。”","“Well, poor fellow, he’s a decent sort of chap, after all,” continued Gabriel in a false voice.“He gave me back that sovereign I lent him, and I didn’t expect it, really.It’s a pity he wouldn’t keep away from that Browne, because he’s not a bad fellow, really.”"
"他现在因为心烦而颤抖起来。为什么她看上去那么心不在焉呢？他不知道自己该如何开始。她也在因为什么事情烦心吗？要是她能自愿转向他或是朝他走来那该多好啊！在她现在这个样子的时候去占有她，那会是野蛮而粗暴的。不，他必须要先在她的眼睛里看到些热情。他渴望去了解她那奇怪的心绪。","He was trembling now with annoyance.Why did she seem so abstracted?He did not know how he could begin.Was she annoyed, too, about something?If she would only turn to him or come to him of her own accord!To take her as she was would be brutal.No, he must see some ardour in her eyes first.He longed to be master of her strange mood."
"“你什么时候借给他那镑钱的？”她停顿了一会儿之后问道。","“When did you lend him the pound?” she asked, after a pause."
"加布里埃尔极力克制着自己才没有口爆粗话来咒骂酒徒马林斯和他的那一英镑。他渴望从灵魂深处向她呼喊，渴望把她的身体抱在自己胸前，渴望征服她。但是他却说：","Gabriel strove to restrain himself from breaking out into brutal language about the sottish Malins and his pound.He longed to cry to her from his soul, to crush her body against his, to overmaster her.But he said:"
"“哦，那是在圣诞节，他在亨利街开那家小小的圣诞贺卡商店的时候。”","“O, at Christmas, when he opened that little Christmas-card shop in Henry Street.”"
"他处在愤怒和欲望带来的狂热之中，竟然没有听到她正从窗边走过来。她在他面前站了一会儿，奇怪地看着他。然后，她突然踮起脚尖，双手轻轻搭在他的肩上，吻了他。","He was in such a fever of rage and desire that he did not hear her come from the window.She stood before him for an instant, looking at him strangely.Then, suddenly raising herself on tiptoe and resting her hands lightly on his shoulders, she kissed him."
"“你是个很宽容的人，加布里埃尔。”她说。","“You are a very generous person, Gabriel,” she said."
"加布里埃尔因为她突然的一吻以及她那句话的奇趣意味而高兴得颤抖起来，他双手放在她的头发上，往后抚拢着，几乎没用手指触碰。洗完后的头发细滑而富有光泽。他的心充盈着幸福。就在刚才他还希望她能主动来到他身边呢。也许她的思绪一直都在和他的思绪并驾齐驱。也许她已经感觉到了他体内冲动的欲望，然后这种依从的心绪就影响了她。既然她能如此轻易地屈就于他，他奇怪自己为什么一直如此怯弱。","Gabriel, trembling with delight at her sudden kiss and at the quaintness of her phrase, put his hands on her hair and began smoothing it back, scarcely touching it with his fingers.The washing had made it fine and brilliant.His heart was brimming over with happiness.Just when he was wishing for it she had come to him of her own accord.Perhaps her thoughts had been running with his.Perhaps she had felt the impetuous desire that was in him, and then the yielding mood had come upon her.Now that she had fallen to him so easily, he wondered why he had been so diffident."
"他站着，双手捧着她的头。然后，他迅捷地用一只胳膊揽住她的身体，把她拉到自己跟前，他轻声说道：","He stood, holding her head between his hands.Then, slipping one arm swiftly about her body and drawing her towards him, he said softly:"
"“格雷塔，亲爱的，你在想什么呢？”","“Gretta, dear, what are you thinking about?”"
"她没有回答，也没有完全屈从于他的搂抱。他又轻声地说道：","She did not answer nor yield wholly to his arm.He said again, softly:"
"“告诉我是什么，格雷塔。我想我知道是怎么回事。是吗？”","“Tell me what it is, Gretta.I think I know what is the matter.Do I know?”"
"她没有马上回答。然后她突然泪流满面地说道：","She did not answer at once.Then she said in an outburst of tears:"
"“我在想那首歌，《奥赫里姆的少女》。”","“O, I am thinking about that song, The Lass of Aughrim.”"
"她从他的怀抱中挣脱出来，跑到了床边，双臂抱住床栏，捂住了脸。加布里埃尔吃惊地呆站了一会儿，然后跟着她走了过去。在他经过活动穿衣镜的时候，他看见了自己的全身形象，他那穿着衬衫宽阔挺拔的前胸，他那张每次在镜子里看到时表情总会让他感到困惑的脸，以及他那闪闪发亮的金边眼镜。他在离她几步远的地方停下来说道：","She broke loose from him and ran to the bed and, throwing her arms across the bed-rail, hid her face.Gabriel stood stockstill for a moment in astonishment and then followed her.As he passed in the way of the cheval-glass he caught sight of himself in full length, his broad, well-filled shirt-front, the face whose expression always puzzled him when he saw it in a mirror, and his glimmering gilt-rimmed eyeglasses.He halted a few paces from her and said:"
"“那首歌怎么了？为什么它会让你哭了呢？”","“What about the song?Why does that make you cry?”"
"她从臂弯里抬起头，像一个孩子似的用手背擦干眼睛。他发出的声音比自己想要发出的更温柔。","She raised her head from her arms and dried her eyes with the back of her hand like a child.A kinder note than he had intended went into his voice."
"“为什么，格雷塔？”他问。","“Why, Gretta?” he asked."
"“我想起了很久以前经常唱那首歌的一个人。”","“I am thinking about a person long ago who used to sing that song.”"
"“那这个很久以前的人是谁？”加布里埃尔微笑着问。","“And who was the person long ago?” asked Gabriel, smiling."
"“那是我和祖母一起生活在戈尔韦的时候认识的一个人。”她说。","“It was a person I used to know in Galway when I was living with my grandmother,” she said."
"笑意渐渐从加布里埃尔的脸上消失了。一股隐隐的怒火开始在他的内心深处再次聚集，隐现的欲望之火开始在他的血脉中愤怒地燃烧起来。","The smile passed away from Gabriel’s face.A dull anger began to gather again at the back of his mind and the dull fires of his lust began to glow angrily in his veins."
"“某个你曾经爱过的人？”他嘲讽地问道。","“Someone you were in love with?” he asked ironically."
"“那是我曾经认识的一个小伙子，”她答道，“名叫迈克尔·弗雷。他过去常唱那首歌，《奥赫里姆的少女》。他的体质非常虚弱。”","“It was a young boy I used to know,” she answered, “named Michael Furey.He used to sing that song, The Lass of Aughrim.He was very delicate.”"
"加布里埃尔沉默不语。他不希望让她以为自己对这个虚弱的小伙子感兴趣。","Gabriel was silent.He did not wish her to think that he was interested in this delicate boy."
"“我能非常清楚地想起他的样子，”过了一会儿她说，“他有着那样的一双眼睛：一双又大又黑的眼睛！眼睛里还有那样一种神情—— 一种神情！”","“I can see him so plainly,” she said, after a moment.“Such eyes as he had: big, dark eyes!And such an expression in them—an expression!”"
"“哦，那么，你爱上他了？”加布里埃尔说。","“O, then, you are in love with him?” said Gabriel."
"“我过去常和他一起出去散步，”她说，“当我在戈尔韦的时候。”","“I used to go out walking with him,” she said, “when I was in Galway.”"
"一个念头闪过加布里埃尔的脑海。","A thought flew across Gabriel’s mind."
"“或许这就是为什么你想和那个艾弗斯小姐去戈尔韦的原因？”他冷冷地说。","“Perhaps that was why you wanted to go to Galway with that Ivors girl?” he said coldly."
"她看着他，惊讶地问道：","She looked at him and asked in surprise:"
"“去干什么呢？”","“What for?”"
"她的眼神让加布里埃尔感到尴尬。他耸了耸肩说：","Her eyes made Gabriel feel awkward.He shrugged his shoulders and said:"
"“我怎么会知道？去看看他，也许。”","“How do I know?To see him, perhaps.”"
"她默默地把目光从他身上移开，顺着那束光线朝窗边望去。","She looked away from him along the shaft of light towards the window in silence."
"“他死了，”她终于说话了，“他只有十七岁的时候就死了。那么年轻就死了难道不是一件可怕的事情吗？”","“He is dead,” she said at length.“He died when he was only seventeen.Isn’t it a terrible thing to die so young as that?”"
"“他是做什么的？”加布里埃尔问道，语气仍然带着嘲讽意味。","“What was he?” asked Gabriel, still ironically."
"“他曾在煤气厂工作。”她说。","“He was in the gasworks,” she said."
"加布里埃尔的嘲讽没有奏效，而她从逝者中唤起了这样一个人物，一个在煤气厂工作过的小伙子，这些都让他感到了羞辱。在他对他们共同的私密生活充满回忆，充满柔情和欢乐还有欲望的时候，她却一直在脑子里拿他和另一个人比较。一种耻辱的感觉袭上心头。他认为自己是一个滑稽可笑的人物，为姨妈们充当跑腿的，一个神经兮兮但却好心好意的多愁善感之人，对着一帮俗人高谈阔论，把自己小丑般的欲望理想化的人，以及刚刚在镜子里瞥见的那个可怜的傻瓜。出于本能地，他尽量背对着光线，唯恐她会看见燃烧在自己额头的这份羞耻感。","Gabriel felt humiliated by the failure of his irony and by the evocation of this figure from the dead, a boy in the gasworks.While he had been full of memories of their secret life together, full of tenderness and joy and desire, she had been comparing him in her mind with another.A shameful consciousness of his own person assailed him.He saw himself as a ludicrous figure, acting as a pennyboy for his aunts, a nervous, well-meaning sentimentalist, orating to vulgarians and idealising his own clownish lusts, the pitiable fatuous fellow he had caught a glimpse of in the mirror.Instinctively he turned his back more to the light lest she might see the shame that burned upon his forehead."
"他极力想继续保持着冷漠盘问的语调，但他开口说话时的声音却既谦卑又淡然。","He tried to keep up his tone of cold interrogation, but his voice when he spoke was humble and indifferent."
"“我觉得你当时是爱上了这个迈克尔·弗雷，格雷塔。”他说。","“I suppose you were in love with this Michael Furey, Gretta,” he said."
"“当时我和他非常要好。”她说。","“I was great with him at that time,” she said."
"她的声音细弱而悲伤。加布里埃尔现在觉得，他努力把她往自己预设的方向上引是多么徒劳，他抚摸着她的一只手，同样悲伤地说道：","Her voice was veiled and sad.Gabriel, feeling now how vain it would be to try to lead her whither he had purposed, caressed one of her hands and said, also sadly:"
"“那他怎么那么年轻就死了呢，格雷塔？肺结核，是吗？”","“And what did he die of so young, Gretta?Consumption, was it?”"
"“我觉得他是因为我才死的。”她回答道。","“I think he died for me,” she answered."
"听到这个回答，一种隐约的恐惧攫住了加布里埃尔，仿佛在他有望胜利的时刻，某种无形邪恶的东西却现身来对抗他，从它那模糊的世界里聚集各种力量来对抗他。但是他努力用理性使自己摆脱掉它，继续抚摸着她的手。他没有再追问她，因为他觉得她会主动告诉他的。她的手温暖而湿润：它没有回应他的触摸，不过他还是继续抚摸着它，正如在那个春天的早上他抚摸着她的第一封信。","A vague terror seized Gabriel at this answer, as if, at that hour when he had hoped to triumph, some impalpable and vindictive being was coming against him, gathering forces against him in its vague world.But he shook himself free of it with an effort of reason and continued to caress her hand.He did not question her again, for he felt that she would tell him of herself.Her hand was warm and moist: it did not respond to his touch, but he continued to caress it just as he had caressed her first letter to him that spring morning."
"“那时候是冬天，”她说，“大约是在我打算离开祖母家到这里的修道院来的那个初冬。当时他生病呆在戈尔韦的住处不能出门，人们已经写信通知了他在乌特拉德的家人。他的情况越来越糟，他们说，或者诸如此类的话。我从来都没有弄明白过。”","“It was in the winter,” she said, “about the beginning of the winter when I was going to leave my grandmother’s and come up here to the convent.And he was ill at the time in his lodgings in Galway and wouldn’t be let out, and his people in Oughterard were written to.He was in decline, they said, or something like that.I never knew rightly.”"
"她停顿了片刻，叹了口气。","She paused for a moment and sighed."
"“可怜的人，”她说，“他很喜欢我，他是那么温柔的一个小伙子。我们常常一起出去，去散步，你知道吧，加布里埃尔，就像在乡下他们经常做的那样。他要不是身体不好就会去学唱歌。他有一副非常好的嗓子，可怜的迈克尔·弗雷。”","“Poor fellow,” she said.“He was very fond of me and he was such a gentle boy.We used to go out together, walking, you know, Gabriel, like the way they do in the country.He was going to study singing only for his health.He had a very good voice, poor Michael Furey.”"
"“呃，那后来呢？”加布里埃尔问。","“Well; and then?” asked Gabriel."
"“后来到我该离开戈尔韦到修道院来的时候，他的情况更糟了，人们不让我去见他，于是我就给他写了一封信说我要到都柏林去了，夏天就会回来，希望到时候他能好起来。”","“And then when it came to the time for me to leave Galway and come up to the convent he was much worse and I wouldn’t be let see him so I wrote him a letter saying I was going up to Dublin and would be back in the summer, and hoping he would be better then.”"
"她停顿了片刻，好控制一下自己的声音，然后接着说道：","She paused for a moment to get her voice under control, and then went on:"
"“然后在我离开的前一天晚上，我正在修女岛上祖母的房子里收拾行李，然后我听到有石子扔上来砸到了窗户上。窗户很潮湿，我看不清，于是当时我便跑下楼，从后面溜进花园里，在花园的那头站着那个可怜的人，浑身颤抖着。”","“Then the night before I left, I was in my grandmother’s house in Nuns’ Island, packing up, and I heard gravel thrown up against the window.The window was so wet I couldn’t see, so I ran downstairs as I was and slipped out the back into the garden and there was the poor fellow at the end of the garden, shivering.”"
"“那么你没有叫他回去吗？”加布里埃尔问。","“And did you not tell him to go back?” asked Gabriel."
"“我恳求他马上回家，并告诉他说在雨里他会给淋死的。可是他说他不想活了。我还能清清楚楚地看见他的眼睛！他站在墙那头，那里有一棵树。”","“I implored of him to go home at once and told him he would get his death in the rain.But he said he did not want to live.I can see his eyes as well as well!He was standing at the end of the wall where there was a tree.”"
"“那他回家了吗？”加布里埃尔问。","“And did he go home?” asked Gabriel."
"“是的，他回家了。我在修道院呆了只有一个星期的时候，他死了，他被埋在了乌特拉德，他们家就是那里的人。啊，那天，我听说那个消息，听说他死了的那一天啊！”","“Yes, he went home.And when I was only a week in the convent he died and he was buried in Oughterard, where his people came from.O, the day I heard that, that he was dead!”"
"她停下来，哽咽地抽泣起来，然后再也控制不住感情，一下子脸朝下地扑到床上，在被子里哭泣起来。加布里埃尔犹豫不定地又握了一会儿她的手，然后羞于侵扰她的悲伤，便任由那只手轻轻落下，起身悄然走到了窗边。","She stopped, choking with sobs, and, overcome by emotion, flung herself face downward on the bed, sobbing in the quilt.Gabriel held her hand for a moment longer, irresolutely, and then, shy of intruding on her grief, let it fall gently and walked quietly to the window."
"她已经沉沉入睡。","She was fast asleep."
"加布里埃尔倚在胳膊肘上，毫无怨怼地盯着她那缠结的头发和半张着的嘴看了好一会儿，听着她那深沉的呼吸。这么说在她的生命中曾有过这样一段浪漫感情：一个男人因她而死。现在，想到自己，她的丈夫，在她的生命中一直扮演着怎样可怜的一个角色，他几乎不再感到痛苦。他注视着她睡觉的样子，仿佛他和她从来没有作为夫妻共同生活过。他好奇的目光长久地落在她的脸上和头发上：然后，他想象着在她初显少女美貌的那个时期，她该会是什么模样，想到这些的时候，一种奇怪而温柔的对她的怜悯之情就会进入他的灵魂。他即使对自己也不愿说她的脸已不再美丽，但是他明白它已不再是迈克尔·弗雷甘愿为之而不惜生命的那张脸。","Gabriel, leaning on his elbow, looked for a few moments unresentfully on her tangled hair and half-open mouth, listening to her deep-drawn breath.So she had had that romance in her life: a man had died for her sake.It hardly pained him now to think how poor a part he, her husband, had played in her life.He watched her while she slept, as though he and she had never lived together as man and wife.His curious eyes rested long upon her face and on her hair: and, as he thought of what she must have been then, in that time of her first girlish beauty, a strange, friendly pity for her entered his soul.He did not like to say even to himself that her face was no longer beautiful, but he knew that it was no longer the face for which Michael Furey had braved death."
"也许她并没有告诉他这个故事的全部。他的目光转移到了她在上面扔了一些衣服的那把椅子。一根内衣带子垂搭在地板上。一只靴子直立在那里，松软的上半截朝下耷拉着：另一只靴子则倒在一旁。他对自己一小时之前那阵躁动的情感惊诧不已。它因何而来的呢？因为姨妈的晚餐，因为自己那篇愚蠢的演讲，因为喝酒和跳舞，因为在大厅里说晚安时的嬉笑逗闹，因为在雪地里沿着河岸散步的乐趣。可怜的朱莉娅姨妈！她很快也将和帕特里克·莫肯和他的马一样成为一种魅影。在她演唱《为婚礼而打扮》的时候，他在她的脸上捕捉到了刹那间闪现的那种憔悴神情。很快，也许，他就会坐在同一间客厅里，身着黑衣，膝盖上放着他的丝帽。百叶窗会放下来，凯特姨妈会坐在他的身旁，边哭边擤鼻子并跟他讲朱莉娅是怎么死的。他会在脑子里搜寻些可能会安慰她的词语，但却只找到些蹩脚而无用的话。是的，是的：这很快就会发生了。","Perhaps she had not told him all the story.His eyes moved to the chair over which she had thrown some of her clothes.A petticoat string dangled to the floor.One boot stood upright, its limp upper fallen down: the fellow of it lay upon its side.He wondered at his riot of emotions of an hour before.From what had it proceeded?From his aunt’s supper, from his own foolish speech, from the wine and dancing, the merry-making when saying good-night in the hall, the pleasure of the walk along the river in the snow.Poor Aunt Julia!She, too, would soon be a shade with the shade of Patrick Morkan and his horse.He had caught that haggard look upon her face for a moment when she was singing Arrayed for the Bridal.Soon, perhaps, he would be sitting in that same drawing-room, dressed in black, his silk hat on his knees.The blinds would be drawn down and Aunt Kate would be sitting beside him, crying and blowing her nose and telling him how Julia had died.He would cast about in his mind for some words that might console her, and would find only lame and useless ones.Yes, yes: that would happen very soon."
"房间里的空气让他的肩膀发冷。他小心翼翼地在被单下伸展开身子，在妻子的身边躺了下来。一个接一个，他们都会变成魅影。最好是在某种充满激情的盛誉之中英勇地投身于另一个世界，而不是随着年岁忧郁地消退和枯萎。他思忖着，这么多年来，情人告诉她说自己不想活时的那种眼神，躺在身边的她是如何深锁心间的。","The air of the room chilled his shoulders.He stretched himself cautiously along under the sheets and lay down beside his wife.One by one, they were all becoming shades.Better pass boldly into that other world, in the full glory of some passion, than fade and wither dismally with age.He thought of how she who lay beside him had locked in her heart for so many years that image of her lover’s eyes when he had told her that he did not wish to live."
"宽容的眼泪溢满了加布里埃尔的眼睛。他自己从来没有因为哪个女人而有过这样的感受，不过他明白这样一种感情一定就是爱情。泪水在他的眼中越聚越多，在半明半暗之中，他想象着自己看见了一个年轻男子的身影，他正站在一棵滴雨的树下。近旁还有些别人的身影。他的灵魂已经靠近了那个地区，那里栖息着大量的死者。他感觉到了，但却无法理解，他们那捉摸不定若有若无的存在。他自己本身则正渐渐退隐到一个触摸不到的灰色世界：而这个实体世界，这些死者曾一度成长生活于其中的这个实体世界，却正在逐渐变小、逐渐消失。","Generous tears filled Gabriel’s eyes.He had never felt like that himself towards any woman, but he knew that such a feeling must be love.The tears gathered more thickly in his eyes and in the partial darkness he imagined he saw the form of a young man standing under a dripping tree.Other forms were near.His soul had approached that region where dwell the vast hosts of the dead.He was conscious of, but could not apprehend, their wayward and flickering existence.His own identity was fading out into a grey impalpable world: the solid world itself, which these dead had one time reared and lived in, was dissolving and dwindling."
"窗玻璃上传来的几声轻响使他转脸朝窗户望去。又开始下雪了。他睡意朦胧地注视着那些雪片，银白而暗淡，斜斜地落在路灯上。该是他出发踏上西行之旅的时候了。是的，报纸上说的是对的：白雪覆盖了整个爱尔兰。雪落在黑暗的中央平原的各个角落，落在没有树木的小山上，轻柔地飘落艾伦沼泽上，再往西，轻柔地飘落在香农河奔流翻涌的黑色水波中。雪也落在了那座埋葬着迈克尔·弗雷的小山上那孤寂墓地的各个角落。雪密密地飘落在那些弯弯扭扭的十字架上和墓碑上，落在那小小墓门的栅栏尖上，落在那些光秃秃的荆棘上。他听到雪轻轻穿过宇宙飘落而下，轻轻地飘落，像是降下了他们的最后归宿，落在了所有的生者和死者身上，他的灵魂慢慢迷失了。","A few light taps upon the pane made him turn to the window.It had begun to snow again.He watched sleepily the flakes, silver and dark, falling obliquely against the lamplight.The time had come for him to set out on his journey westward.Yes, the newspapers were right: snow was general all over Ireland.It was falling on every part of the dark central plain, on the treeless hills, falling softly upon the Bog of Allen and, farther westward, softly falling into the dark mutinous Shannon waves.It was falling, too, upon every part of the lonely churchyard on the hill where Michael Furey lay buried.It lay thickly drifted on the crooked crosses and headstones, on the spears of the little gate, on the barren thorns.His soul swooned slowly as he heard the snow falling faintly through the universe and faintly falling, like the descent of their last end, upon all the living and the dead."
