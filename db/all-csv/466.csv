"The Sleuths","侦探"
"by O. Henry","作者：欧·亨利"
"In the Big City a man will disappear with the suddenness and completeness of the flame of a candle that is blown out.","在纽约，一个人会在突然之间完全消失，就像被吹灭的蜡烛火苗似的。"
"All the agencies of inquisition—the hounds of the trail, the sleuths of the city’s labyrinths, the closet detectives of theory and induction—will be invoked to the search.","所有的调查力量——寻踪嗅迹的警犬、城市迷宫里的侦探，和纸上谈兵、富于推理、专门调查丑闻的私人侦探——都将参与搜查。"
"Most often the man’s face will be seen no more.","通常情况下，失踪的人就永远地消失了。"
"Sometimes he will reappear in Sheboygan or in the wilds of Terre Haute, calling himself one of the synonyms of “Smith,” and without memory of events up to a certain time, including his grocer’s bill.","有时候，他会出现在希博伊根或是特雷霍特的荒郊野外，自称“史密斯”或诸如此类的姓名，而且对某段时间的事情已经记忆全无，包括他杂货店的账单。"
"Sometimes it will be found, after dragging the rivers, and polling the restaurants to see if he may be waiting for a well-done sirloin, that he has moved next door.","有时候，在抽干了河水，排查了餐厅看他是不是在等一份全熟的牛脊肉后，却发现他只是搬到了隔壁的房子而已。"
"This snuffing out of a human being like the erasure of a chalk man from a blackboard is one of the most impressive themes in dramaturgy.","一个大活人突然消失，就像从黑板上擦掉粉笔画似的，这是令人印象深刻的戏剧题材之一。"
"The case of Mary Snyder, in point, should not be without interest.","有关玛丽·斯奈德的个案，肯定能引起读者的兴趣。"
"A man of middle age, of the name of Meeks, came from the West to New York to find his sister, Mrs. Mary Snyder, a widow, aged fifty-two, who had been living for a year in a tenement house in a crowded neighbourhood.","一个名为米克斯的中年男子，为了寻找姐姐玛丽·斯奈德太太，从西部来到纽约。斯奈德太太是个寡妇，52岁，曾在一个拥挤的街区出租公寓里住过一年。"
"At her address he was told that Mary Snyder had moved away longer than a month before.","米克斯在玛丽·斯奈德的住处得知，她一个多月前就已经搬走了。"
"No one could tell him her new address.","没人知道她现在住哪里。"
"On coming out Mr. Meeks addressed a policeman who was standing on the corner, and explained his dilemma.","从公寓出来，米克斯向一个站在街角的警察打听，对他说明了难处。"
"“My sister is very poor,” he said, “and I am anxious to find her.","“我姐姐很穷，”他说，“我急着找到她。"
"I have recently made quite a lot of money in a lead mine, and I want her to share my prosperity.","最近我在一个铅矿挣了一大笔钱，我想让她跟我过点儿好日子。"
"There is no use in advertising her, because she cannot read.”","在报上登寻人启事没有用，因为她不识字。”"
"The policeman pulled his moustache and looked so thoughtful and mighty that Meeks could almost feel the joyful tears of his sister Mary dropping upon his bright blue tie.","警察捋了捋他的小胡子，看上去思考得很缜密，胸有成竹，米克斯几乎觉得他姐姐欣喜的泪水已经滴落到他宝蓝色的领带上了。"
"“You go down in the Canal Street neighbourhood,” said the policeman, “and get a job drivin’ the biggest dray you can find.","“你去运河街一带，”警察说道，“找个赶大车的活。"
"There’s old women always gettin’ knocked over by drays down there.","那里总有老太太被大货车撞倒。"
"You might see ’er among ’em.","没准儿你能在她们中间找到你姐姐。"
"If you don’t want to do that you better go ’round to headquarters and get ’em to put a fly cop onto the dame.”","如果你不想那么做的话，那就最好去总局，请他们找个便衣警察来帮你找这位太太。”"
"At police headquarters, Meeks received ready assistance.","在警察局总局，米克斯受到了热情的接待。"
"A general alarm was sent out, and copies of a photograph of Mary Snyder that her brother had were distributed among the stations.","他们发布了全面通告，还把米克斯带来的玛丽·斯奈德的照片复印后分发到了各个派出所。"
"In Mulberry Street the chief assigned Detective Mullins to the case.","在桑树街派出所，所长安排马林斯侦探负责这个案子。"
"The detective took Meeks aside and said:","侦探把米克斯拉到一边，说道："
"“This is not a very difficult case to unravel.","“这个案子不难解决。"
"Shave off your whiskers, fill your pockets with good cigars, and meet me in the café of the Waldorf at three o’clock this afternoon.”","剃掉你的胡须，在兜里装满上好的雪茄，今天下午3点到沃尔多夫饭店的咖啡厅来见我。”"
"Meeks obeyed.","米克斯照做了。"
"He found Mullins there.","他在那里和马林斯碰了面。"
"They had a bottle of wine, while the detective asked questions concerning the missing woman.","他们要了瓶酒，期间侦探询问了些有关那位失踪女人的情况。"
"“Now,” said Mullins, “New York is a big city, but we’ve got the detective business systematized.","“哎，”马林斯说道，“纽约是个大城市，不过我们侦探行业已经系统化了。"
"There are two ways we can go about finding your sister.","有两种办法可以找到你姐姐。"
"We will try one of ’em first.","我们先试一种吧。"
"You say she’s fifty-two?”","你说她52岁？”"
"“A little past,” said Meeks.","“稍微大一点儿。”米克斯说。"
"The detective conducted the Westerner to a branch advertising office of one of the largest dailies.","侦探把这个西部人带到全市最大的报社之一的广告部分部办公室。"
"There he wrote the following “ad” and submitted it to Meeks:","在这里，他写了下面的这则广告，并交给米克斯过目。"
"“Wanted, at once—one hundred attractive chorus girls for a new musical comedy.","“急聘——新排音乐喜剧，需招百名美丽动人的歌舞女演员。"
"Apply all day at No. —Broadway.”","全天报名。于百老汇大街××号。”"
"Meeks was indignant.","米克斯怒不可遏。"
"“My sister,” said he, “is a poor, hard-working, elderly woman.","“我的姐姐，”他说，“是个上了年纪的、贫穷的、勤劳的女人。"
"I do not see what aid an advertisement of this kind would be toward finding her.”","我看不出这么一则广告对找到她能帮上什么忙。”"
"“All right,” said the detective.","“好吧，”侦探说道，"
"“I guess you don’t know New York.","“我想你还不了解纽约。"
"But if you’ve got a grouch against this scheme we’ll try the other one.","但是如果你对这个方案不满意的话，我们可以试试另一个。"
"It’s a sure thing.","肯定能解决问题。"
"But it’ll cost you more.”","但是你要多花一点儿钱。”"
"“Never mind the expense,” said Meeks; “we’ll try it.”","“不用担心费用，”米克斯说，“我们试试吧。”"
"The sleuth led him back to the Waldorf.","侦探把他带回到沃尔多夫饭店。"
"“Engage a couple of bedrooms and a parlour,” he advised, “and let’s go up.”","“开一个有两间卧室和一个客厅的套房，”他建议说，“我们上去。”"
"This was done, and the two were shown to a superb suite on the fourth floor.","开了房间后，两人被引到四楼的一个豪华套房。"
"Meeks looked puzzled.","米克斯感到莫名其妙。"
"The detective sank into a velvet armchair, and pulled out his cigar case.","侦探一屁股坐到天鹅绒的扶手椅上，取出雪茄烟盒。"
"“I forgot to suggest, old man,” he said, “that you should have taken the rooms by the month.","“我忘了提醒你，老兄，”他说，“你应该按月包房。"
"They wouldn’t have stuck you so much for ’em.","他们就不会收费这么高了。”"
"“By the month!” exclaimed Meeks.","“按月包房！”米克斯惊呼道，"
"“What do you mean?”","“你什么意思？”"
"“Oh, it’ll take time to work the game this way.","“噢，这方案需要时间。"
"I told you it would cost you more.","我告诉过你花销会大些。"
"We’ll have to wait till spring.","我们要等到开春。"
"There’ll be a new city directory out then.","到那时候会出一本新的城市电话簿。"
"Very likely your sister’s name and address will be in it.”","上面很可能会有你姐姐的姓名和地址。”"
"Meeks rid himself of the city detective at once.","米克斯立即打发走了这个侦探。"
"On the next day some one advised him to consult Shamrock Jolnes, New York’s famous private detective, who demanded fabulous fees, but performed miracles in the way of solving mysteries and crimes.","第二天，有人劝他去咨询沙洛克·乔尔摩斯，纽约著名的私家侦探，虽然他收费极高，但是却在揭开迷局和破获案件中创造过奇迹。"
"After waiting for two hours in the anteroom of the great detective’s apartment, Meeks was shown into his presence.","米克斯在大侦探公寓的接待室等了两个小时后见到了他。"
"Jolnes sat in a purple dressing-gown at an inlaid ivory chess table, with a magazine before him, trying to solve the mystery of “They.”","乔尔摩斯身穿紫色的晨衣，坐在一张象牙镶嵌的棋桌旁边，面前有一本杂志，在破解“名人近况”的谜团。"
"The famous sleuth’s thin, intellectual face, piercing eyes, and rate per word are too well known to need description.","这位大名鼎鼎的侦探那瘦削而睿智的脸庞、那双犀利的眼睛以及字字如金的高昂费用，是尽人皆知的。"
"Meeks set forth his errand.","米克斯提出他的委托事项。"
"“My fee, if successful, will be $500,” said Shamrock Jolnes.","“如果成功的话，我收费500美金。”沙洛克·乔尔摩斯说道。"
"Meeks bowed his agreement to the price.","米克斯点头，同意了这个价钱。"
"“I will undertake your case, Mr. Meeks,” said Jolnes, finally.","“我将受理你的案子，米克斯先生。”乔尔摩斯最后说，"
"“The disappearance of people in this city has always been an interesting problem to me.","“这个城市的人口失踪一直是我关心的问题。"
"I remember a case that I brought to a successful outcome a year ago.","我还记得一年前我破过的一个案子。"
"A family bearing the name of Clark disappeared suddenly from a small flat in which they were living.","有一家姓克拉克的人家突然从他们住的小公寓里失踪了。"
"I watched the flat building for two months for a clue.","为了寻找线索，我在他们的公寓蹲守了两个月。"
"One day it struck me that a certain milkman and a grocer’s boy always walked backward when they carried their wares upstairs.","有一天，我突然发现那个牛奶工和杂货店伙计往楼梯上搬运货物的时候，总是朝相反方向走。"
"Following out by induction the idea that this observation gave me, I at once located the missing family.","我根据这一观察作出了推理，很快就找到了失踪的一家人。"
"They had moved into the flat across the hall and changed their name to Kralc.”","他们搬到了走廊对面的一间公寓，把姓也改成了科拉尔克。”"
"Shamrock Jolnes and his client went to the tenement house where Mary Snyder had lived, and the detective demanded to be shown the room in which she had lived.","沙洛克·乔尔摩斯和他的委托人去了玛丽·斯奈德曾经住过的出租公寓，侦探要求查看一下她以前住过的房间。"
"It had been occupied by no tenant since her disappearance.","自从她失踪以后，这里还没有新住户。"
"The room was small, dingy, and poorly furnished.","这个房间又小又暗，没有几件家具。"
"Meeks seated himself dejectedly on a broken chair, while the great detective searched the walls and floor and the few sticks of old, rickety furniture for a clue.","米克斯垂头丧气地坐在一把破椅子上，大侦探则在墙壁、地板和那几件摇摇欲坠的旧家具上寻找蛛丝马迹。"
"At the end of half an hour Jolnes had collected a few seemingly unintelligible articles—a cheap black hat pin, a piece torn off a theatre programme, and the end of a small torn card on which was the word “left” and the characters “C 12.”","过了半个小时，乔尔摩斯收集了几件莫名其妙的物件——一个廉价的黑色帽针、一张剧院节目单的碎片、一小张硬纸片的末端，上面写着“左排”和“C12”的字样。"
"Shamrock Jolnes leaned against the mantel for ten minutes, with his head resting upon his hand, and an absorbed look upon his intellectual face.","沙洛克·乔尔摩斯用手托着头，充满智慧的脸上露出沉思的神情，靠着壁炉架待了十分钟。"
"At the end of that time he exclaimed, with animation:","最后他兴奋地大喊道："
"“Come, Mr. Meeks; the problem is solved.","“来吧，米克斯先生，问题解决了。"
"I can take you directly to the house where your sister is living.","我可以直接带你去你姐姐现在的住处。"
"And you may have no fears concerning her welfare, for she is amply provided with funds—for the present at least.”","你不必担心她目前的处境，因为她的钱很宽裕——至少目前如此。”"
"Meeks felt joy and wonder in equal proportions.","米克斯又惊又喜。"
"“How did you manage it?” he asked, with admiration in his tones.","“你怎么知道的？”他不无钦佩地问道。"
"Perhaps Jolnes’s only weakness was a professional pride in his wonderful achievements in induction.","乔尔摩斯唯一的缺点，大概就是他对推理方面的杰出成绩有着职业的自豪感。"
"He was ever ready to astound and charm his listeners by describing his methods.","他总是乐于描述他的方法，使他的听众瞠目结舌、如痴如醉。"
"“By elimination,” said Jolnes, spreading his clues upon a little table, “I got rid of certain parts of the city to which Mrs. Snyder might have removed.","“用排除法，”乔尔摩斯说着，把找到的线索摊在一张小桌子上，“我排除了这座城市里斯奈德太太可能搬迁的地区。"
"You see this hatpin?","你看到这个帽针了吗？"
"That eliminates Brooklyn.","凭它排除了布鲁克林。"
"No woman attempts to board a car at the Brooklyn Bridge without being sure that she carries a hatpin with which to fight her way into a seat.","妇女们在布鲁克林桥乘车时，没有不带帽针的，用它才能挤上车抢个座位。"
"And now I will demonstrate to you that she could not have gone to Harlem.","现在我还可以证明给你看，她不会在哈莱姆区。"
"Behind this door are two hooks in the wall.","这扇门后的墙上钉着两个挂钩。"
"Upon one of these Mrs. Snyder has hung her bonnet, and upon the other her shawl.","一个是斯奈德太太挂帽子用的，另一个用来挂披肩。"
"You will observe that the bottom of the hanging shawl has gradually made a soiled streak against the plastered wall.","你可以看出悬挂的披肩的下端在石灰墙上形成的一道污迹。"
"The mark is clean-cut, proving that there is no fringe on the shawl.","这痕迹轮廓清晰，证明披肩上没有流苏。"
"Now, was there ever a case where a middle-aged woman, wearing a shawl, boarded a Harlem train without there being a fringe on the shawl to catch in the gate and delay the passengers behind her?","那么，哈莱姆区有哪个中年妇女的披肩是不带流苏，上车时不钩住车门而耽误后面乘客的呢？"
"So we eliminate Harlem.","所以我们可以排除哈莱姆区。"
"“Therefore I conclude that Mrs. Snyder has not moved very far away.","“因此我断定斯奈德太太并没有搬得太远。"
"On this torn piece of card you see the word ‘Left,’ the letter ‘C,’ and the number ‘12.’","这张撕过的硬纸片的一角上可以看到有‘左排’、字母‘C’，和数字‘12’的字样。"
"Now, I happen to know that No. 12 Avenue C is a first-class boarding house, far beyond your sister’s means—as we suppose.","我正好知道C大街12号是座一流公寓，按照我们的估计，远不是你姐姐的经济能力水平所能负担的。"
"But then I find this piece of a theatre programme, crumpled into an odd shape.","但是我又发现这张剧院节目单，揉搓的形状很奇怪。"
"What meaning does it convey."
"None to you, very likely, Mr. Meeks; but it is eloquent to one whose habits and training take cognizance of the smallest things.","米克斯先生，这对你很可能毫无意义。但对于一个习惯从细枝末节捕捉信息和训练有素的人来说，它说明很多问题。"
"“You have told me that your sister was a scrub woman.","“你告诉过我，你姐姐是个清洁工。"
"She scrubbed the floors of offices and hallways.","她打扫写字楼和过道的地板。"
"Let us assume that she procured such work to perform in a theatre.","我们假设她在剧院找到一份清洁工作。"
"Where is valuable jewellery lost the oftenest, Mr. Meeks?","贵重的珠宝最容易在什么地方丢失呢，米克斯先生？"
"In the theatres, of course.","当然是剧院。"
"Look at that piece of programme, Mr. Meeks.","看看这张缺损的节目单，米克斯先生。"
"Observe the round impression in it.","请注意上面的圆印。"
"It has been wrapped around a ring—perhaps a ring of great value.","它包过一枚戒指——没准儿是很值钱的戒指。"
"Mrs. Snyder found the ring while at work in the theatre.","斯奈德太太在剧院打扫的时候发现了这枚戒指。"
"She hastily tore off a piece of a programme, wrapped the ring carefully, and thrust it into her bosom.","她匆忙地撕下一张节目单，小心地把戒指包好，揣进怀里。"
"The next day she disposed of it, and, with her increased means, looked about her for a more comfortable place in which to live.","第二天，她脱手了，有了钱，便想给自己找个舒服点儿的住处。"
"When I reach thus far in the chain I see nothing impossible about No. 12 Avenue C.","当想到这一步时，我认为C大街12号完全有可能。"
"It is there we will find your sister, Mr. Meeks.”","我们一定会在那里找到你姐姐的，米克斯先生。”"
"Shamrock Jolnes concluded his convincing speech with the smile of a successful artist.","沙洛克·乔尔摩斯带着成功艺术家的微笑，结束了他令人信服的演说。"
"Meeks’s admiration was too great for words.","米克斯的仰慕无以言表。"
"Together they went to No. 12 Avenue C.","他们一起去了C大街12号。"
"It was an old-fashioned brownstone house in a prosperous and respectable neighbourhood.","这是座老式的赤褐色砂石建筑，附近住的都是富裕体面的人家。"
"They rang the bell, and on inquiring were told that no Mrs. Snyder was known there, and that not within six months had a new occupant come to the house.","他们按响门铃，前来开门的人说，那里没听说过有一位斯奈德太太，而且这里最近六个月也没有新搬来的住户。"
"When they reached the sidewalk again, Meeks examined the clues which he had brought away from his sister’s old room.","他们又回到人行道上，米克斯检查了他从姐姐原来住处带来的线索。"
"“I am no detective,” he remarked to Jolnes as he raised the piece of theatre programme to his nose, “but it seems to me that instead of a ring having been wrapped in this paper it was one of those round peppermint drops.","“我不是侦探，”他把那张剧院节目单的纸片拿到鼻子跟前闻了闻，对乔尔摩斯说，“但是我觉得用它包过的不是枚戒指，而是那种圆形的薄荷糖。"
"And this piece with the address on it looks to me like the end of a seat coupon—No. 12, row C, left aisle.”","这张有地址的硬纸片，以我之见，应该是写有座位号的票根——左边C排12号。”"
"Shamrock Jolnes had a far-away look in his eyes.","沙洛克·乔尔摩斯眼里充满了茫然。"
"“I think you would do well to consult Juggins,” said he.","“我想你不如去请教尤金斯吧。”他说。"
"“Who is Juggins?” asked Meeks.","“尤金斯是谁？”米克斯问。"
"“He is the leader,” said Jolnes, “of a new modern school of detectives.","“他是，”乔尼斯说，“一位现代侦探新学派的领袖。"
"Their methods are different from ours, but it is said that Juggins has solved some extremely puzzling cases.","他们的方法和我们的不同，但是据说尤金斯解决过几个异常棘手的案子。"
"I will take you to him.”","我带你去找他。”"
"They found the greater Juggins in his office.","他们在他的事务所里见到了更伟大的尤金斯。"
"He was a small man with light hair, deeply absorbed in reading one of the bourgeois works of Nathaniel Hawthorne.","他身材瘦小，头发稀疏，正在全神贯注地阅读纳撒尼尔·霍桑的一部资产阶级的小说。"
"The two great detectives of different schools shook hands with ceremony, and Meeks was introduced.","这两位不同派别的大侦探礼貌地握了握手，乔尔摩斯把米克斯介绍给了尤金斯。"
"“State the facts,” said Juggins, going on with his reading.","“说说情况吧。”尤金斯说道，继续看他的书。"
"When Meeks ceased, the greater one closed his book and said:","米克斯说完之后，大侦探合上书开口说："
"“Do I understand that your sister is fifty-two years of age, with a large mole on the side of her nose, and that she is a very poor widow, making a scanty living by scrubbing, and with a very homely face and figure?”","“你姐姐52岁，鼻子旁边有颗大黑痣，是个穷寡妇，靠做清洁工来维持生计，相貌和身材都很普通，我可以这样理解吗？”"
"“That describes her exactly,” admitted Meeks.","“完全正确。”米克斯承认说。"
"Juggins rose and put on his hat.","尤金斯站起来戴好帽子。"
"“In fifteen minutes,” he said, “I will return, bringing you her present address.”","“15分钟以后，”他说，“我会回来，告诉你她现在的住址。”"
"Shamrock Jolnes turned pale, but forced a smile.","沙洛克·乔尔摩斯的脸色一下子白了，但还是勉强笑笑。"
"Within the specified time Juggins returned and consulted a little slip of paper held in his hand.","尤金斯在他自己限定的时间内回来了，看着手里拿的一张小纸条。"
"“Your sister, Mary Snyder,” he announced calmly, “will be found at No. 162 Chilton street.","“你的姐姐玛丽·斯奈德，”他平静地念道，“住在奇尔顿大街162号。"
"She is living in the back hall bedroom, five flights up.","在五层走廊尽头隔出来的房间。"
"The house is only four blocks from here,” he continued, addressing Meeks.","那房子离这儿只有四个街区。”他对米克斯接着说，"
"“Suppose you go and verify the statement and then return here.","“你可以去核实一下，然后回来。"
"Mr. Jolnes will await you, I dare say.”","我相信乔尔摩斯先生会等着你。”"
"Meeks hurried away.","米克斯便匆忙地走了。"
"In twenty minutes he was back again, with a beaming face.","20分钟后，他满脸笑容地回来。"
"“She is there and well!” he cried.","“她的确在那里，一切都好。”他大声说，"
"“Name your fee!”","“说说你的费用吧！”"
"“Two dollars,” said Juggins.","“两美元。”尤金斯说。"
"When Meeks had settled his bill and departed, Shamrock Jolnes stood with his hat in his hand before Juggins.","米克斯付完账走了，沙洛克·乔尔摩斯拿着帽子站在尤金斯面前。"
"“If it would not be asking too much,” he stammered—“if you would favour me so far—would you object to—”","“如果我的要求不过分的话，”他吞吞吐吐地说，“假如能麻烦您——您介意——”"
"“Certainly not,” said Juggins pleasantly.","“当然不会，”尤金斯快活地说，"
"“I will tell you how I did it.","“我来告诉你我是怎么做到的。"
"You remember the description of Mrs. Snyder?","你记得我刚才对斯奈德太太的描述吗？"
"Did you ever know a woman like that who wasn’t paying weekly instalments on an enlarged crayon portrait of herself?","像她这样的女人，有哪个不是按周分期付款，来为自己定一幅放大的蜡笔肖像画的？"
"The biggest factory of that kind in the country is just around the corner.","而全国最大的经营这种业务的作坊就在街角上。"
"I went there and got her address off the books.","我去那里从登记册上抄下了她的地址。"
"That’s all.”","就是这样。”"
