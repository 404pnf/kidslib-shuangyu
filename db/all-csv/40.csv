"少年国王","The Young King"
"加冕礼日的前一天晚上，少年国王独自坐在他那间漂亮的房子里。大臣们按照当朝隆重的礼节给他叩头后便告辞而去。他们退到皇宫的大殿中，跟礼仪老师再学习几堂课，因为他们当中有几个人的举止还相当随便。不用说，这对一名大臣来讲是大忌。","It was the night before the day fixed for his coronation, and the young King was sitting alone in his beautiful chamber.His courtiers had all taken their leave of him, bowing their heads to the ground, according to the ceremonious usage of the day, and had retired to the Great Hall of the Palace, to receive a few last lessons from the Professor of Etiquette; there being some of them who had still quite natural manners, which in a courtier is, I need hardly say, a very grave offence."
"这位少年——他不过是个少年，仅仅十六岁——对大臣们的退朝一点儿也不觉得难过。他长长地舒了口气，一屁股倒在绣花沙发软垫上。他躺在那里，眼睛睁得大大的，张着嘴巴，像一位掌管林地的棕色农牧神，又像一只刚被猎人在森林中诱捕的小动物。","The lad—for he was only a lad, being but sixteen years of age—was not sorry at their departure, and had flung himself back with a deep sigh of relief on the soft cushions of his embroidered couch, lying there, wild-eyed and open-mouthed, like a brown woodland Faun, or some young animal of the forest newly snared by the hunters."
"的确，是猎人发现了他，几乎是碰巧遇到他。当时他四肢裸露，手里拿着笛子，跟在把他抚养大的牧羊人的羊群后面，那时他也以为自己就是穷牧羊人的儿子。这个孩子的母亲是老国王的独生女儿。她和一个地位比她低得多的男人私定了终身——有人说，那是个外地人，他能用鲁特琴弹奏出各种美妙动听的音乐，最终使年轻的公主钟情于他；又有人说，那个男人是个来自意大利里米尼的艺术家，公主很尊重他，没准都到了过于尊重的程度了。可后来他突然间从城里消失了，那幅没有完成的作品还留在大教堂里——少年国王出生才一个星期大时，被人从他熟睡的母亲身边偷偷抱走，交给了一对平凡的农家夫妇照管。这对夫妇自己没有孩子，他们住在森林深处，从城里骑马要一天多的时间才能到达那里。对于他母亲的死，宫廷御医声称是由于悲伤或是身染瘟疫，而另外有人说是因为饮了大量放了意大利急性毒药的香料酒。反正那位给予这孩子生命的白皙少女在醒来一个时辰后就死了。一位忠诚的差人把孩子放在鞍头上，当他从疲惫的马上屈身去敲响牧羊人简陋的小茅屋房门时，公主的尸体正被下葬到一个敞开的墓穴中，这个墓穴就挖在城门外一个荒凉的教堂墓地上。据说那个墓穴里还躺着另一具尸体，是个非常英俊的外地男人，双手被反绑着，打了个绳结，胸膛上有好多血淋淋的伤口。","And, indeed, it was the hunters who had found him, coming upon him almost by chance as, bare-limbed and pipe in hand, he was following the flock of the poor goatherd who had brought him up, and whose son he had always fancied himself to be.The child of the old King’s only daughter by a secret marriage with one much beneath her in station—a stranger, some said, who, by the wonderful magic of his lute-playing, had made the young Princess love him; while others spoke of an artist from Rimini, to whom the Princess had shown much, perhaps too much honour,and who had suddenly disappeared from the city, leaving his work in the Cathedral unfinished—he had been, when but a week old, stolen away from his mother’s side, as she slept, and given into the charge of a common peasant and his wife, who were without children of their own, and lived in a remote part of the forest, more than a day’s ride from the town.Grief, or the plague, as the court physician stated, or, as some suggested, a swift Italian poison administered in a cup of spiced wine, slew, within an hour of her wakening, the white girl who had given him birth, and as the trusty messenger who bare the child across his saddle-bow stooped from his weary horse and knocked at the rude door of the goatherd’s hut, the body of the Princess was being lowered into an open grave that had been dug in a deserted churchyard, beyond the city gates, a grave where it was said that another body was also lying, that of a young man of marvellous and foreign beauty, whose hands were tied behind him with a knotted cord, and whose breast was stabbed with many red wounds."
"至少，这就是人们私下暗传的故事。然而能确定的是，老国王在临终时，要么是追悔自己曾犯下的深重罪孽，要么仅仅是不希望自己的王国落入外人之手，就派人去找回那个少年，并当着满朝文武的面承认这少年是自己的继位人。","Such, at least, was the story that men whispered to each other.Certain it was that the old King, when on his deathbed, whether moved by remorse for his great sin, or merely desiring that the kingdom should not pass away from his line, had had the lad sent for, and, in the presence of the Council, had acknowledged him as his heir."
"似乎就从少年被承认是继位人的那一刻起，他就表现出了对美异常强烈的激情，这也注定了他的一生将因此而受到巨大的影响。那些在他寝宫里侍候他的仆人常常讲起当时的情景：当他看见那些为他而准备的华丽服装和贵重宝石时，他兴奋地大叫起来，立马欣喜若狂地脱去身上的粗皮衣和粗羊皮外套。有时候他确实也很怀念那段在森林里自由自在的生活，还总是对占去一天大部分时间的冗长乏味的宫廷礼仪感到烦躁，但这毕竟是座富丽堂皇的宫殿——被人们称作“逍遥殿”——如今他是这里的主人，一切对他来说，就像是一个专为取悦他而建造的新世界。但凡他能够从会议室或接见室里逃出来，他便会沿着那两边立着镀金铜狮、用斑岩铺成台阶的华丽楼梯跑下去，从一个屋子转到另一个屋子，又从一条走廊绕到另一条走廊。他是那么热切地寻找美，如同一个人疼痛时急切地想要找到一剂止痛药，生病时渴望恢复健康一般。他将之称为发现之旅——对他而言，真有如漫游于神境中一般。有时他还会带上几个宫廷侍从，他们身材修长，头发金黄，身披轻扬的披风，上面飘着艳丽的缎带。但更多的时候，他是一个人，凭着某种直觉，也可以说是一种顿悟，敏锐地领悟到艺术的奥妙只可意会。美，亦如智慧，钟情于孤独的崇拜者。","And it seems that from the very first moment of his recognition he had shown signs of that strange passion for beauty that was destined to have so great an influence over his life.Those who accompanied him to the suite of rooms set apart for his service, often spoke of the cry of pleasure that broke from his lips when he saw the delicate raiment and rich jewels that had been prepared for him, and of the almost fierce joy with which he flung aside his rough leathern tunic and coarse sheepskin cloak.He missed, indeed, at times the fine freedom of his forest life, and was always apt to chafe at the tedious Court ceremonies that occupied so much of each day, but the wonderful palace—JOYEUSE, as they called it—of which he now found himself lord, seemed to him to be a new world fresh-fashioned for his delight;and as soon as he could escape from the council-board or audience-chamber, he would run down the great staircase, with its lions of gilt bronze and its steps of bright porphyry, and wander from room to room, and from corridor to corridor, like one who was seeking to find in beauty an anodyne from pain, a sort of restoration from sickness.Upon these journeys of discovery, as he would call them—and, indeed, they were to him real voyages through a marvellous land, he would sometimes be accompanied by the slim, fair-haired Court pages, with their floating mantles, and gay fluttering ribands; but more often he would be alone, feeling through a certain quick instinct, which was almost a divination, that the secrets of art are best learned in secret, and that Beauty, like Wisdom, loves the lonely worshipper."
"这段日子流传着很多有关他的奇闻轶事。据说有一位大腹便便的市长，代表全体市民发表了一通华而不实的演讲，说他看见少年国王对一幅刚从威尼斯带来的巨画崇拜得五体投地，这幅画宣扬的似乎是对几个新神的崇拜。还有一回他失踪了好几个小时，人们费尽周折才在宫殿北边角楼的一间小屋子里找到了他，当时他正痴呆呆地凝视着一块希腊宝石，上面雕刻着美少年阿多尼斯。另外有传言说亲眼看见他热吻一尊古罗马大理石雕像的前额。那尊雕像是人们修建石桥时在河床里发现的，雕像上还刻着罗马皇帝哈德良的比提尼亚籍奴隶的名字。他还曾熬通宵观察月光照在恩底弥翁银像上产生的效果。","Many curious stories were related about him at this period.It was said that a stout Burgo-master, who had come to deliver a florid oratorical address on behalf of the citizens of the town, had caught sight of him kneeling in real adoration before a great picture that had just been brought from Venice, and that seemed to herald the worship of some new gods.On another occasion he had been missed for several hours, and after a lengthened search had been discovered in a little chamber in one of the northern turrets of the palace gazing, as one in a trance, at a Greek gem carved with the figure of Adonis.He had been seen, so the tale ran, pressing his warm lips to the marble brow of an antique statue that had been discovered in the bed of the river on the occasion of the building of the stone bridge, and was inscribed with the name of the Bithynian slave of Hadrian.He had passed a whole night in noting the effect of the moonlight on a silver image of Endymion."
"毋庸置疑，一切稀罕、昂贵的东西都对他具有极大的吸引力，都激起他想拥有它们的强烈欲望。为此他派出了许多商队，有的被派往北海，向那里的穷渔夫购买琥珀；有的被派往埃及，去寻找那种只有在国王的墓穴中才能找得到的奇特绿松石，据说这种宝石具有非凡的魔力；有的被派往波斯，购买丝织地毯和彩陶；还有的被派往印度，购买薄纱和彩绘象牙、月长石、玉镯、檀香木、蓝色珐琅，以及上等的羊毛披肩。","All rare and costly materials had certainly a great fascination for him, and in his eagerness to procure them he had sent away many merchants, some to traffic for amber with the rough fisher-folk of the north seas, some to Egypt to look for that curious green turquoise which is found only in the tombs of kings, and is said to possess magical properties,some to Persia for silken carpets and painted pottery, and others to India to buy gauze and stained ivory, moonstones and bracelets of jade, sandal-wood and blue enamel and shawls of fine wool."
"然而，最让他费心的还是他登基加冕时要穿的金线织的长袍、镶嵌红宝石的皇冠，以及挂着一串串珍珠的权杖。其实，当他今晚靠在奢华的沙发上，望着大块的松木在敞开的壁炉里慢慢燃烧时，他想的就是这个。它们都是由当时最著名的艺术家亲手设计的，设计样式早在几个月前就呈交给他了。他也下令要求工匠们夜以继日地把它们赶制出来，还派人满世界地寻找配得上工匠们手艺的珠宝。想着想着，他仿佛看到了自己身穿雍容华贵的皇袍站在教堂里高高的祭坛上。这时他那仍显稚气的嘴唇上露出了笑容，那双森林中人特有的黑眼睛也熠熠生辉。","But what had occupied him most was the robe he was to wear at his coronation, the robe of tissued gold, and the ruby-studded crown, and the sceptre with its rows and rings of pearls.Indeed, it was of this that he was thinking to-night, as he lay back on his luxurious couch, watching the great pinewood log that was burning itself out on the open hearth.The designs, which were from the hands of the most famous artists of the time, had been submitted to him many months before, and he had given orders that the artificers were to toil night and day to carry them out, and that the whole world was to be searched for jewels that would be worthy of their work.He saw himself in fancy standing at the high altar of the cathedral in the fair raiment of a King, and a smile played and lingered about his boyish lips, and lit up with a bright lustre his dark woodland eyes."
"过了一会儿，他站起来，倚靠着烟囱的雕花遮棚，环视光线昏暗的屋子。墙上挂着华丽的挂毯，上面栩栩如生地描绘着《美之凯旋》。一个镶嵌着玛瑙和琉璃的大衣柜占满了墙的一角。窗户对面立着一个精心制作的陈列柜，上面的漆格层不是镀了金粉就是镶着金片，格层上摆放着一些精美的威尼斯高脚玻璃杯，还有一个黑纹缟玛瑙杯子。丝织被单上绣着浅色的罂粟花，好像是那个困倦的手艺人来不及给它们添加更艳丽的丝线而不得已成了浅色似的。刻有条形凹槽的高大象牙柱撑起天鹅绒华盖，华盖上面大簇的鸵鸟毛像白色泡沫一样膨胀，一直延伸到用回纹装饰的银白色天花板上。青铜像那喀索斯笑盈盈地将一面亮光光的镜子举过头。桌上放着一只紫水晶做的浅口碗。","After some time he rose from his seat, and leaning against the carved penthouse of the chimney, looked round at the dimly-lit room.The walls were hung with rich tapestries representing the Triumph of Beauty.A large press, inlaid with agate and lapis-lazuli, filled one corner, and facing the window stood a curiously wrought cabinet with lacquer panels of powdered and mosaiced gold, on which were placed some delicate goblets of Venetian glass, and a cup of dark-veined onyx.Pale poppies were broidered on the silk coverlet of the bed, as though they had fallen from the tired hands of sleep, and tall reeds of fluted ivory bare up the velvet canopy, from which great tufts of ostrich plumes sprang, like white foam, to the pallid silver of the fretted ceiling.A laughing Narcissus in green bronze held a polished mirror above its head.On the table stood a flat bowl of amethyst."
"他看到了外面大教堂的巨型圆顶，隐隐约约的，像个泡泡浮动在有些看不清的房屋上面。无精打采的哨兵在雾蒙蒙的近水平台上来回走着。远处的一片果树林里传来了夜莺的歌唱。一缕淡淡的茉莉花香从开着的窗户飘了进来。他把前额上的棕色卷发拂到后面，随后拿起一把鲁特琴，信手弹了起来。弹着弹着，他的眼皮沉重地耷拉下来，一股莫名的倦意袭遍全身。此前他从没有这么强烈、这么兴奋地感受到美的魔力和神秘。","Outside he could see the huge dome of the cathedral, looming like a bubble over the shadowy houses, and the weary sentinels pacing up and down on the misty terrace by the river.Far away, in an orchard, a nightingale was singing.A faint perfume of jasmine came through the open window.He brushed his brown curls back from his forehead, and taking up a lute, let his fingers stray across the cords.His heavy eyelids drooped, and a strange languor came over him.Never before had he felt so keenly, or with such exquisite joy, the magic and the mystery of beautiful things."
"当钟楼传来午夜的钟声时，他按了一下铃，侍从们便进来了。他们遵照繁文缛节为他脱去衣服，往他手里倒上玫瑰香水，还在他的枕头上撒了鲜花。侍从们离开房间后没多久他就睡着了。","When midnight sounded from the clock-tower he touched a bell, and his pages entered and disrobed him with much ceremony, pouring rose-water over his hands, and strewing flowers on his pillow.A few moments after that they had left the room, he fell asleep."
"睡着后他做了一个梦，他梦到：","And as he slept he dreamed a dream, and this was his dream."
"他站在一间幽长又低矮的阁楼里，四周是一片唧唧复唧唧的织布声。微弱的日光透过格栅窗照进阁楼，他看到了织布工伏在织布机上的憔悴身影。一些面无血色、带着病容的孩子蹲在巨大的横梁上。当梭子飞快地穿过经线时，织布工便抬起沉重的筘座，让经线通过筘齿；梭子一停来，他们就立即放下筘座，把纬线推到一起。他们个个面黄肌瘦，一双双瘦骨嶙峋的手不停地抖动着。一些形容枯槁的妇女围着一张桌子做缝纫活。那个地方充满了刺鼻的臭气。空气既污浊又沉闷，墙壁因为潮湿不停地滴水，汇成了细流。","He thought that he was standing in a long, low attic, amidst the whir and clatter of many looms.The meagre daylight peered in through the grated windows, and showed him the gaunt figures of the weavers bending over their cases.Pale, sickly-looking children were crouched on the huge crossbeams.As the shuttles dashed through the warp they lifted up the heavy battens, and when the shuttles stopped they let the battens fall and pressed the threads together.Their faces were pinched with famine, and their thin hands shook and trembled.Some haggard women were seated at a table sewing.A horrible odour filled the place.The air was foul and heavy, and the walls dripped and streamed with damp."
"少年国王走近一位织布工，站在一旁看着他工作。","The young King went over to one of the weavers, and stood by him and watched him."
"织布工怒气冲冲地瞪着他说：“你为什么老盯着我？你是我们主人派来监视我们干活的探子吗？”“谁是你们的主人？”少年国王问道。","And the weaver looked at him angrily, and said, “Why art thou watching me?Art thou a spy set on us by our master?” “Who is thy master?” asked the young King."
"“我们的主人！”织工痛苦地大叫道，“他跟我一样都是人。然而，我和他之间的唯一差别就在于——我破衣烂衫，他衣冠楚楚；我饿得骨瘦如柴，他撑得难受。”“这是个自由的国度，”少年国王说，“你不是任何人的奴隶。”“在战争年代，”织布工回答说，“强者把弱者变为奴隶，而在和平年代，富人把穷人变成奴隶。为了能糊口，我们必须劳作，可是他们给的工资少得可怜，我们生不如死。我们整天为他们卖苦力，他们的箱子里堆满了黄金，可我们的子女却未成年就夭折了；我们所爱的那些人也变得尖酸刻薄、令人讨厌。我们榨出葡萄汁，可品尝葡萄酒的是别人。我们种庄稼，可我们的餐桌空空如也。尽管肉眼看不见，可我们的确戴着枷锁；尽管人们称我们是自由人，可我们实际上是奴隶。”“这里所有的人都是这样的吗？”少年国王问道。“这里所有的人都这样，”织布工答道，“不论是年幼的还是年长的，不论是男人还是女人，不论是小孩子还是挣扎了大半辈子的人。商人压榨我们，我们还得听从他们的吩咐。神父骑马走过，对着念珠念念有词，但没有谁真正关心我们。贫穷在我们阴暗的小巷里匍匐前行，眼里尽是饥饿；罪恶面无表情，紧随其后。早晨悲痛把我们唤醒，晚上耻辱与我们同坐。可是这些与你何干呢？你又不是我们中的一员。你看起来是那么快乐。”说完织布工一脸不快地转过头去穿纺梭。这时少年国王看见梭子上穿过的是一根金线。","“Our master!” cried the weaver, bitterly.“He is a man like myself.Indeed, there is but this difference between us—that he wears fine clothes while I go in rags, and that while I am weak from hunger he suffers not a little from overfeeding.” “The land is free,” said the young King, “and thou art no man’s slave.” “In war,” answered the weaver, “the strong make slaves of the weak, and in peace the rich make slaves of the poor.We must work to live, and they give us such mean wages that we die.We toil for them all day long, and they heap up gold in their coffers, and our children fade away before their time, and the faces of those we love become hard and evil.We tread out the grapes, and another drinks the wine.We sow the corn, and our own board is empty.We have chains, though no eye beholds them; and are slaves, though men call us free.” “Is it so with all?” he asked.“It is so with all,” answered the weaver, “with the young as well as with the old, with the women as well as with the men, with the little children as well as with those who are stricken in years.The merchants grind us down, and we must needs do their bidding.The priest rides by and tells his beads, and no man has care of us.Through our sunless lanes creeps Poverty with her hungry eyes, and Sin with his sodden face follows close behind her.Misery wakes us in the morning, and Shame sits with us at night.But what are these things to thee?Thou art not one of us.Thy face is too happy.”And he turned away scowling, and threw the shuttle across the loom, and the young King saw that it was threaded with a thread of gold."
"他心里一紧，赶忙问织布工：“你们织的是什么长袍？”“这是少年国王加冕时穿的袍子，”织布工回答道，“这和你有什么关系？”这时少年国王大叫一声，惊醒了，瞧！他原来是在自己的房间里，透过窗户他看见昏黄的圆月挂在熹微的夜空上。","And a great terror seized upon him, and he said to the weaver, “What robe is this that thou art weaving?” “It is the robe for the coronation of the young King,” he answered; “what is that to thee?” And the young King gave a loud cry and woke, and lo! he was in his own chamber, and through the window he saw the great honey-coloured moon hanging in the dusky air."
"然后他又睡着了，又开始做梦，他的梦是这样的:","And he fell asleep again and dreamed, and this was his dream."
"他躺在一艘大帆船的甲板上，床上有一百个奴隶在划桨。船长就坐在他身旁的地毯上。船长黑得堪比乌木，头戴深红色的丝织包头巾。船长那厚厚的耳垂上挂着一对硕大的银耳坠，他的手中拿着一杆象牙制的秤。","He thought that he was lying on the deck of a huge galley that was being rowed by a hundred slaves.On a carpet by his side the master of the galley was seated.He was black as ebony, and his turban was of crimson silk.Great earrings of silver dragged down the thick lobes of his ears, and in his hands he had a pair of ivory scales."
"奴隶们除了有一块破烂的缠腰布外，全身上下光溜溜的，他们每个人都被用铁链和身边的人锁在了一起。炎炎烈日烤在他们身上，此外还有黑人在跳板上跑来跑去，拿皮鞭抽打他们。他们伸出枯瘦的双臂，划动水中沉重的浆。船桨溅起咸咸的海水。","The slaves were naked, but for a ragged loin-cloth, and each man was chained to his neighbour.The hot sun beat brightly upon them, and the negroes ran up and down the gangway and lashed them with whips of hide.They stretched out their lean arms and pulled the heavy oars through the water.The salt spray flew from the blades."
"最终他们来到一个小海湾，开始测量水深。一阵微风从岸上吹来，给甲板和大三角帆上蒙上了一层细细的红沙。三个阿拉伯人骑着野毛驴，靠近帆船后就朝船上的人投梭镖。船长拉开一张漆了色的弓，射中了他们当中一人的咽喉。那人重重地栽到了波涛里，他的同伴也都落荒而逃。一位蒙着黄色面纱的女子骑着骆驼慢慢地跟在后面，还不时地回头看看那具死尸。","At last they reached a little bay, and began to take soundings.A light wind blew from the shore, and covered the deck and the great lateen sail with a fine red dust.Three Arabs mounted on wild asses rode out and threw spears at them.The master of the galley took a painted bow in his hand and shot one of them in the throat.He fell heavily into the surf, and his companions galloped away.A woman wrapped in a yellow veil followed slowly on a camel, looking back now and then at the dead body."
"奴隶们一抛锚降帆，黑人就跑到船舱拿出一根长长的绳梯，并绑在铅锤上。船长把绳梯扔到船的一侧，又把绳梯的两端牢牢地系在两根铁柱上。接着黑人们抓住那个最年轻的奴隶，砸开他的脚镣，用蜡封住他的鼻孔和耳朵，又在他的腰间捆上一块大石头。他疲惫不堪地爬下绳梯，不一会儿就消失在海水中了。他下水的地方冒出了几个泡泡。其他一些奴隶在一旁好奇地张望着。一个戏耍鲨鱼的人坐在船头，单调地敲着鼓。","As soon as they had cast anchor and hauled down the sail, the negroes went into the hold and brought up a long rope-ladder, heavily weighted with lead.The master of the galley threw it over the side, making the ends fast to two iron stanchions.Then the negroes seized the youngest of the slaves and knocked his gyves off, and filled his nostrils and his ears with wax, and tied a big stone round his waist.He crept wearily down the ladder, and disappeared into the sea.A few bubbles rose where he sank.Some of the other slaves peered curiously over the side.At the prow of the galley sat a shark-charmer, beating monotonously upon a drum."
"过了一会儿，潜水者冒出水面。他喘着粗气，紧紧地抓住梯子，右手中握着一粒珍珠。黑人们从他手中夺去珍珠后，又把他推到海里。而这时其他的奴隶已靠在浆旁睡着了。","After some time the diver rose up out of the water, and clung panting to the ladder with a pearl in his right hand.The negroes seized it from him, and thrust him back.The slaves fell asleep over their oars."
"他上来了一次又一次，每次都带回一颗美丽的珍珠。船长把珍珠一一过了秤，并把它们放进一个绿皮革的小袋子里。","Again and again he came up, and each time that he did so he brought with him a beautiful pearl.The master of the galley weighed them, and put them into a little bag of green leather."
"少年国王想说点什么，可是他的舌头好像给上颚粘住了，嘴唇也动弹不了。黑人们喋喋不休，开始为一条闪亮的珠串互相争吵起来。两只鹤围绕着帆船飞个不停。","The young King tried to speak, but his tongue seemed to cleave to the roof of his mouth, and his lips refused to move.The negroes chattered to each other, and began to quarrel over a string of bright beads.Two cranes flew round and round the vessel."
"潜水者最后一次冒出水面，他带上来了一颗霍尔木兹岛所有的珍珠都无法与之媲美的珍珠，因为其圆润有如一轮满月，洁白甚于晨星。不过他的脸色惨白得吓人，很快他便一头栽倒在甲板上，鲜血从他的耳朵和鼻孔中流淌出来。　他抖动了几下就再也动弹不了了。黑人们耸耸肩，把他的尸体从船上抛向大海。","Then the diver came up for the last time, and the pearl that he brought with him was fairer than all the pearls of Ormuz, for it was shaped like the full moon, and whiter than the morning star.But his face was strangely pale, and as he fell upon the deck the blood gushed from his ears and nostrils.He quivered for a little, and then he was still.The negroes shrugged their shoulders, and threw the body overboard."
"船长笑了笑，伸手拿起那颗珍珠，把它紧贴在自己的前额上，并鞠了个躬。“这个嘛，”他说，“应该用来装饰少年国王的权杖。”说完，他向黑人们示意起锚。","And the master of the galley laughed, and, reaching out, he took the pearl, and when he saw it he pressed it to his forehead and bowed.“It shall be,” he said, “for the sceptre of the young King,” and he made a sign to the negroes to draw up the anchor."
"听到这里，少年国王又大叫一声，惊醒了。透过窗户，他看见破晓的微弱晨光正划破星星寥落的天空。","And when the young King heard this he gave a great cry, and woke, and through the window he saw the long grey fingers of the dawn clutching at the fading stars."
"然后他再一次睡着了，再一次进入梦乡，他的梦是这样的：","And he fell asleep again, and dreamed, and this was his dream."
"他游荡在一个阴森森的树林里，树上结着奇怪的果子，还开着美丽而有毒的鲜花。从小毒蛇身边走过时，它们朝他嘶嘶作响；羽毛艳丽的鹦鹉从一根树枝飞到另一根树枝，叫声刺耳。庞大的乌龟躺在热乎乎的泥潭里睡觉。树上到处都是猿猴和孔雀。","He thought that he was wandering through a dim wood, hung with strange fruits and with beautiful poisonous flowers.The adders hissed at him as he went by, and the bright parrots flew screaming from branch to branch.Huge tortoises lay asleep upon the hot mud.The trees were full of apes and peacocks."
"他一直往前走，最终走出了树林；在那儿，他看到一条枯竭的河，河床上有好大一群人在做苦役。那些人如蚂蚁般成群结队地聚集在砂岩上。他们在地上挖了很多深洞，然后钻进去。其中一些人用大斧头劈石，另一些人在沙滩上摸索着。","On and on he went, till he reached the outskirts of the wood, and there he saw an immense multitude of men toiling in the bed of a dried-up river.They swarmed up the crag like ants.They dug deep pits in the ground and went down into them.Some of them cleft the rocks with great axes; others grabbled in the sand."
"他们连根拔起仙人掌，还践踏鲜红的花朵。他们匆匆忙忙，彼此叫嚷着，没有一个人闲着。","They tore up the cactus by its roots, and trampled on the scarlet blossoms.They hurried about, calling to each other, and no man was idle."
"洞穴的阴暗处，死神和贪婪之神密切地注视着他们。死神开口说：“我已经等得不耐烦了，把他们中的三分之一给我，我就离开。”但是贪婪之神摇了摇头。“他们是我的仆人。”她回答说。","From the darkness of a cavern Death and Avarice watched them, and Death said, “I am weary; give me a third of them and let me go.”But Avarice shook her head.“They are my servants,” she answered."
"接着死神好奇地问贪婪之神：“你手里拿的是什么？”“三粒谷子，”贪婪之神回答说，“不过这与你何干？”“给我一粒，”死神大喊道，“种在我的花园里。只要给我一粒，我就离开。”“我半粒都不会给你的。”说完贪婪就把手藏在自己衣服的褶缝里。","And Death said to her, “What hast thou in thy hand?” “I have three grains of corn,” she answered; “what is that to thee?” “Give me one of them,” cried Death, “to plant in my garden; only one of them, and I will go away.” “I will not give thee anything,” said Avarice, and she hid her hand in the fold of her raiment."
"死神笑了，拿起一只杯子，把它浸在水池里；等杯子拿出来时，里面已孳生了疟疾。疟疾横扫人群，于是三分之一的人迅速倒下，死掉了。随后升腾起一股寒气，水蛇蜂拥而至。","And Death laughed, and took a cup, and dipped it into a pool of water, and out of the cup rose Ague.She passed through the great multitude, and a third of them lay dead.A cold mist followed her, and the water-snakes ran by her side."
"眼见三分之一的人都死去了，贪婪之神捶胸哭泣。贪婪之神捶打着自己干瘪的胸脯，大声痛哭起来。“你已经杀掉了我三分之一的仆人，”她喊道，“赶紧离开这儿吧。一场战争在鞑靼人的山上爆发了，双方的国王都在召唤你。阿富汗人杀掉了黑牛，正前往战场。他们用长矛敲击自己的盾牌，还戴上了铁盔。我这区区山谷对你有什么用呢，你有什么必要呆在这儿呢？你快离开吧，不要再来这儿了。”“不行，”死亡回答说，“除非你给我一粒谷子，否则我是绝不会走的。”可贪婪之神却紧握拳头，咬紧牙关。“我什么都不会给你的。”她嘀咕道。","And when Avarice saw that a third of the multitude was dead she beat her breast and wept.She beat her barren bosom, and cried aloud.“Thou hast slain a third of my servants,” she cried, “get thee gone.There is war in the mountains of Tartary, and the kings of each side are calling to thee.The Afghans have slain the black ox, and are marching to battle.They have beaten upon their shields with their spears, and have put on their helmets of iron.What is my valley to thee, that thou shouldst tarry in it?Get thee gone, and come here no more.” “Nay,” answered Death, “but till thou hast given me a grain of corn I will not go.” But Avarice shut her hand, and clenched her teeth.“I will not give thee anything,” she muttered."
"死亡又笑了，他捡起一块黑色的石头，朝树林中扔去，于是野毒芹丛中出现了身穿火焰长袍的热病。热病来到人群中，触摸他们，凡是被她碰着的人都死掉了。她脚下踩过的青草也跟着枯萎了。","And Death laughed, and took up a black stone, and threw it into the forest, and out of a thicket of wild hemlock came Fever in a robe of flame.She passed through the multitude, and touched them, and each man that she touched died.The grass withered beneath her feet as she walked."
"贪婪之神颤抖起来，把灰烬放在自己的头上。“你太残忍了，”她叫道，“你太残忍了。印度的很多城寨正在闹饥荒，撒马尔罕的蓄水池里也干涸了。埃及的好多城寨也在闹饥荒，此外，蝗虫也从沙漠里飞来了。尼罗河水还没有溢出河岸，神父们正诅咒着伊希斯和奥西里斯。到那些需要你的地方去吧，放过我的仆人们。”“不行，”死神回答说，“除非你给我一粒谷子，否则我坚决不走。”“休想我给你半粒谷子。”贪婪之神说。","And Avarice shuddered, and put ashes on her head.“Thou art cruel,” she cried; “thou art cruel.There is famine in the walled cities of India, and the cisterns of Samarcand have run dry.There is famine in the walled cities of Egypt, and the locusts have come up from the desert.The Nile has not overflowed its banks, and the priests have cursed Isis and Osiris.Get thee gone to those who need thee, and leave me my servants.” “Nay,” answered Death, “but till thou hast given me a grain of corn I will not go.” “I will not give thee anything,” said Avarice."
"死神再一次笑了，他将手指放在嘴边，吹了一声口哨，只见一个女人从空中飞来。她的额头上印着“瘟疫”两个字，一群瘦骨嶙峋的兀鹰盘旋在她身旁。她用翅膀覆盖整个山谷，于是没有一个人活了下来。","And Death laughed again, and he whistled through his fingers, and a woman came flying through the air.Plague was written upon her forehead, and a crowd of lean vultures wheeled round her.She covered the valley with her wings, and no man was left alive."
"贪婪之神尖叫着穿过树林逃走了，死神也跨上他那匹红色的大马疾驰而去，他的马跑得比风还快。","And Avarice fled shrieking through the forest, and Death leaped upon his red horse and galloped away, and his galloping was faster than the wind."
"谷底的烂泥中爬出无数条龙和带鳞甲的怪兽，一群胡狼也沿着沙滩跑来，并用鼻孔吸着空气。","And out of the slime at the bottom of the valley crept dragons and horrible things with scales, and the jackals came trotting along the sand, sniffing up the air with their nostrils."
"少年国王哭了，并说道：“他们是些什么人？他们在寻找什么？”“找国王皇冠上的红宝石。”站在他身后的一个人回答说。","And the young King wept, and said: “Who were these men, and for what were they seeking?” “For rubies for a king’s crown,” answered one who stood behind him."
"少年国王吃了一惊，转过身来，看见一个朝圣者打扮的人，这人手中拿着一面银镜。","And the young King started, and, turning round, he saw a man habited as a pilgrim and holding in his hand a mirror of silver."
"他脸色变得苍白，问道：“哪一个国王？”朝圣者回答说：“看着这面镜子，你会看见他的。”他朝镜子看去，见到的是他自己的面孔，他大叫了一声，又惊醒了。灿烂的阳光洒满了房间，从花园和庭院里传来了树上鸟儿的歌声。","And he grew pale, and said: “For what king?” And the pilgrim answered: “Look in this mirror, and thou shalt see him.” And he looked in the mirror, and, seeing his own face, he gave a great cry and woke, and the bright sunlight was streaming into the room, and from the trees of the garden and pleasaunce the birds were singing."
"宫廷大臣和文武百官都来向他行礼。侍者给他拿来金线织的长袍，还把王冠和权杖放在他面前。","And the Chamberlain and the high officers of State came in and made obeisance to him, and the pages brought him the robe of tissued gold, and set the crown and the sceptre before him."
"少年国王看着它们，它们实在是美极了。它们比他以前见过的任何东西都要美。然而他还记得自己做的梦，便对大臣们说：“把这些东西都拿走，我不会穿上它们的。”听到这话，群臣都很震惊，有些人甚至笑了，以为国王是在开玩笑。","And the young King looked at them, and they were beautiful.More beautiful were they than aught that he had ever seen.But he remembered his dreams, and he said to his lords: “Take these things away, for I will not wear them.” And the courtiers were amazed, and some of them laughed, for they thought that he was jesting."
"少年国王很严肃地对他们又说了一遍：“把这些东西都拿走，不要让我见到它们。尽管今天是我加冕的日子，可我绝不会穿上它们。因为我的这件长袍是织布工用痛苦的苍白双手在忧伤的织布机上织出的。红宝石的中心浸染了鲜血，珍珠的中心笼罩着死亡。”接着少年国王又对大臣们讲了他的三个梦。","But he spake sternly to them again, and said: “Take these things away, and hide them from me.Though it be the day of my coronation, I will not wear them.For on the loom of Sorrow, and by the white hands of Pain, has this my robe been woven.There is Blood in the heart of the ruby, and Death in the heart of the pearl.”And he told them his three dreams."
"大臣们听完三个梦后，面面相觑，交头接耳道：“他一定是疯了。梦只不过是一个梦，幻觉也只不过是幻觉而已。它们都不是真实的，用不着在意。再说，那些为我们卖力的人的性命与我们何干呢？难道一个人没有见过耕者就不能吃面包了吗？没有和葡萄园丁交谈过就不能喝葡萄酒了吗？”宫廷大臣对少年国王说：“陛下，我恳求您抛开这些悲伤的念头，穿上这袭华美的长袍，戴上这顶皇冠吧。要是您不穿上皇袍，百姓怎么会认出您就是国王呢？”少年国王望着他。“真是这样的吗？”他问道，“要是我不穿上皇袍，他们就认不出我是国王了吗？”“他们认不出您的，陛下。”宫廷大臣大声说。","And when the courtiers heard them they looked at each other and whispered, saying: “Surely he is mad; for what is a dream but a dream, and a vision but a vision?They are not real things that one should heed them.And what have we to do with the lives of those who toil for us?Shall a man not eat bread till he has seen the sower, nor drink wine till he has talked with the vinedresser?” And the Chamberlain spake to the young King, and said, “My lord, I pray thee set aside these black thoughts of thine, and put on this fair robe, and set this crown upon thy head.For how shall the people know that thou art a king, if thou hast not a king’s raiment?” And the young King looked at him.“Is it so, indeed?” he questioned.“Will they not know me for a king if I have not a king’s raiment?” “They will not know thee, my lord,” cried the Chamberlain."
"“我还以为当真存在面带帝王之相的人呢，”少年国王回答说，“不过也许事实正如你所说的。可我还是不能穿这身长袍，也不能戴这顶皇冠，我要像进宫时那样子走出去。”然后他吩咐他们都退下，只留一个侍从陪他。这个侍从小他一岁。侍从留下来服侍少年国王。少年国王在清水里洗了个澡，打开一个漆过的大箱子，从箱子里取出皮衣和粗羊皮外套，这些都是他当年在山坡上放粗毛山羊时穿过的。他穿上这些衣服，手里拿着那根粗糙的牧羊仗。","“I had thought that there had been men who were kinglike,” he answered, “but it may be as thou sayest.And yet I will not wear this robe, nor will I be crowned with this crown, but even as I came to the palace so will I go forth from it.” And he bade them all leave him, save one page whom he kept as his companion, a lad a year younger than himself.Him he kept for his service, and when he had bathed himself in clear water, he opened a great painted chest, and from it he took the leathern tunic and rough sheepskin cloak that he had worn when he had watched on the hillside the shaggy goats of the goatherd.These he put on, and in his hand he took his rude shepherd’s staff."
"小侍从吃惊地睁大一双蓝眼睛，微笑着问他：“陛下，我看出了您的长袍和权杖，可您的皇冠在哪儿呢？”少年国王从攀过阳台的野荆棘上折下一根枝，把它弯成一个圆圈，戴在自己的头上。","And the little page opened his big blue eyes in wonder, and said smiling to him, “My lord, I see thy robe and thy sceptre, but where is thy crown?” And the young King plucked a spray of wild briar that was climbing over the balcony, and bent it, and made a circlet of it, and set it on his own head."
"“这就是我的皇冠。”他答道。","“This shall he my crown,” he answered."
"如此打扮后，少年国王走出他的寝宫来到大殿中，达官贵人们都在那儿等着他。","And thus attired he passed out of his chamber into the Great Hall, where the nobles were waiting for him."
"达官贵人们都觉得很好笑，其中一些人疾声呼道：“陛下，臣民们都等着见他们的国王，而您却让他们看到了一个乞丐。”另一些人怒气冲冲地说：“他使我们的国家蒙羞，不配当我们的君王。”但是少年国王一言不发，径直朝前走去，走下斑岩铺成的明净的石阶，出了青铜大门，骑上自己的马，朝教堂奔去，小侍从跟在他旁边跑着。","And the nobles made merry, and some of them cried out to him, “My lord, the people wait for their king, and thou showest them a beggar,” and others were wroth and said, “He brings shame upon our state, and is unworthy to be our master.”But he answered them not a word, but passed on, and went down the bright porphyry staircase, and out through the gates of bronze, and mounted upon his horse, and rode towards the cathedral, the little page running beside him."
"百姓见他那样子都哈哈大笑起来，还说：“看啊，国王的愚臣骑马过来了。”他们都嘲笑他。","And the people laughed and said, “It is the King’s fool who is riding by,” and they mocked him."
"少年国王勒住马说：“不，我正是国王。”接着他便给百姓讲了自己的三个梦。","And he drew rein and said, “Nay, but I am the King.”And he told them his three dreams."
"这时人群中闯出一个人，对少年国王挖苦道：“皇上，您难道不知道穷人的生活正是仰仗富人的奢侈吗？正是你们富有我们才得以生存，是你们的恶习给我们带来了面包。给一个严厉的主子干活固然很辛苦，可是如果连主子都没有，我们就举步维艰了。您以为我们能靠乌鸦过活吗？您又有什么良方可以改善这些状况呢？您会对买主说‘你要花这么多钱来购买’，而同时又对卖主说‘你要以这个价格来出售’吗？我敢说您不会。所以，还是回到您的宫中，穿上您高贵的亚麻紫袍吧。您和我们以及我们所遭受的痛苦有什么相干呢？”“难道富人和穷人不是兄弟吗？”少年国王问道。","And a man came out of the crowd and spake bitterly to him, and said, “Sir, knowest thou not that out of the luxury of the rich cometh the life of the poor?By your pomp we are nurtured, and your vices give us bread.To toil for a hard master is bitter, but to have no master to toil for is more bitter still.Thinkest thou that the ravens will feed us?And what cure hast thou for these things?Wilt thou say to the buyer, “Thou shalt buy for so much,” and to the seller, “Thou shalt sell at this price”?I trow not.Therefore go back to thy Palace and put on thy purple and fine linen.What hast thou to do with us, and what we suffer?” “Are not the rich and the poor brothers?” asked the young King."
"“是啊，”那人答道，“有钱的那个兄弟名叫该隐。”听他这么说，少年国王的眼里噙满泪水，他骑着马在人们的嘟囔声中继续前进。小侍从渐渐感到害怕，也离开了他。","“Ay,” answered the man, “and the name of the rich brother is Cain.” And the young King’s eyes filled with tears, and he rode on through the murmurs of the people, and the little page grew afraid and left him."
"少年国王来到教堂的大门口时，卫兵们举起他们手中的戟问他：“你上这儿来干什么？除了国王以外任何人禁止走此门。”少年国王气得满脸通红，对他们说：“我就是国王。”说完推开卫兵的戟，走了进去。","And when he reached the great portal of the cathedral, the soldiers thrust their halberts out and said, “What dost thou seek here?None enters by this door but the King.” And his face flushed with anger, and he said to them, “I am the King,” and waved their halberts aside and passed in."
"老主教见一身牧羊人打扮的少年国王走进来，便惊诧地从宝座上站起来，迎上前去，对他说：“我的孩子，这是国王的服饰吗？我该用什么皇冠来为你加冕呢？又该拿怎样的权杖置于你手中呢？今天对你来说理应是个开心的日子，而不应是一个受辱的日子。”“难道我的快乐要建立在百姓的痛苦之上吗？”少年国王问。然后他又对老主教讲了自己的三个梦。","And when the old Bishop saw him coming in his goatherd’s dress, he rose up in wonder from his throne, and went to meet him, and said to him, “My son, is this a king’s apparel?And with what crown shall I crown thee, and what sceptre shall I place in thy hand?Surely this should be to thee a day of joy, and not a day of abasement.” “Shall Joy wear what Grief has fashioned?” said the young King.And he told him his three dreams."
"主教听完了三个梦后，眉头紧锁，他说：“孩子，我老了，已经到了垂暮之年，我深知在这个大千世界里存在很多邪恶的东西。凶狠的土匪从山上下来，劫走小孩子，又把他们卖给摩尔人。狮子躺在那里，窥伺着过往的商队，准备扑咬骆驼。野猪连根拱起山谷里的庄稼，狐狸咬断山上的葡萄藤。海盗在沿海兴风作浪、焚烧渔船，还抢走渔民的渔网。麻风病人住在盐沼地带，他们用芦苇杆搭起小屋，没有人愿意接近他们。乞丐们流浪在各个城市，与狗争食吃。你能够阻止这些事情的发生吗？你愿意同麻风病人一起睡觉，同乞丐一起用餐吗？狮子会听你的话，野猪会遵从你的命令吗？难道制造出这些苦难的上帝还不如你明智吗？因此，我不会为你所做的事而称赞你。我恳求你赶紧骑马回宫，脸上要露出笑容，并穿上符合国王身份的衣服。我要用金皇冠为你加冕，我要把嵌满珍珠的权杖放在你手中。至于你的那些梦，就不要再想它们了。现世的负担太沉重了，不是哪一个人能负荷得起的；人间的痛苦太沉重了，不是哪一颗心灵能承受得了的。”“站在这间屋子里，你能说的就只有这些吗？”少年国王一边质问主教，一边大步流星地从主教身旁走过，登上圣坛的台阶，站在基督像前。","And when the Bishop had heard them he knit his brows, and said, “My son, I am an old man, and in the winter of my days, and I know that many evil things are done in the wide world.The fierce robbers come down from the mountains, and carry off the little children, and sell them to the Moors.The lions lie in wait for the caravans, and leap upon the camels.The wild boar roots up the corn in the valley, and the foxes gnaw the vines upon the hill.The pirates lay waste the sea-coast and burn the ships of the fishermen, and take their nets from them.In the salt-marshes live the lepers; they have houses of wattled reeds, and none may come nigh them.The beggars wander through the cities, and eat their food with the dogs.Canst thou make these things not to be?Wilt thou take the leper for thy bedfellow, and set the beggar at thy board?Shall the lion do thy bidding, and the wild boar obey thee?Is not He who made misery wiser than thou art?Wherefore I praise thee not for this that thou hast done, but I bid thee ride back to the Palace and make thy face glad, and put on the raiment that beseemeth a king, and with the crown of gold I will crown thee, and the sceptre of pearl will I place in thy hand.And as for thy dreams, think no more of them.The burden of this world is too great for one man to bear, and the world’s sorrow too heavy for one heart to suffer.” “Sayest thou that in this house?” said the young King, and he strode past the Bishop, and climbed up the steps of the altar, and stood before the image of Christ."
"他站在基督像前。他的右手和左手边分别放着华丽的金盆、装黄酒的圣餐杯和装圣油的瓶子。接着他跪在基督像面前。巨大的蜡烛在镶着珠宝的神龛旁熊熊燃烧着。燃香上升腾起一圈圈蓝色的轻烟，飘向穹顶。他叩头祈祷，那些神父们身着僵硬的法袍，悄悄地走下了圣坛。","He stood before the image of Christ, and on his right hand and on his left were the marvellous vessels of gold, the chalice with the yellow wine, and the vial with the holy oil.He knelt before the image of Christ, and the great candles burned brightly by the jewelled shrine, and the smoke of the incense curled in thin blue wreaths through the dome.He bowed his head in prayer, and the priests in their stiff copes crept away from the altar."
"突然，从外面的大街上传来了巨大的喧哗声，一群头上晃着羽缨的贵族冲了进来，手中握着出鞘的宝剑和磨得锃亮的钢盾。“说梦话的那个人在什么地方？”他们大声嚷道，“就是那个所谓的国王，那个打扮得像个乞丐——使我们国家蒙羞的小子，在什么地方？我们一定要杀了他，他不配统治我们。”少年国王再一次叩头祈祷，祷告完毕后他站起来，转过身悲伤地望着他们。","And suddenly a wild tumult came from the street outside, and in entered the nobles with drawn swords and nodding plumes, and shields of polished steel.“Where is this dreamer of dreams?” they cried.“Where is this King who is apparelled like a beggar—this boy who brings shame upon our state?Surely we will slay him, for he is unworthy to rule over us.” And the young King bowed his head again, and prayed, and when he had finished his prayer he rose up, and turning round he looked at them sadly."
"瞧！阳光透过漆窗照在他的身上，光线在他的四周织出一件织锦长袍，比那件专为取悦他而织成的长袍更加精美。枯死的枝条上盛开着鲜花，那是比珍珠还要洁白的怒放的百合花。干枯的荆棘也开出花来，露出的玫瑰花比红宝石还要鲜红。百合花比上等珍珠还要洁白，根茎是用亮闪闪的银子制成的。玫瑰花比鲜红的红宝石更红，叶子是用金箔铸成的。","And lo! through the painted windows came the sunlight streaming upon him, and the sun-beams wove round him a tissued robe that was fairer than the robe that had been fashioned for his pleasure.The dead staff blossomed, and bare lilies that were whiter than pearls.The dry thorn blossomed, and bare roses that were redder than rubies.Whiter than fine pearls were the lilies, and their stems were of bright silver.Redder than male rubies were the roses, and their leaves were of beaten gold."
"少年国王身穿国王的服饰站在那里。镶嵌着珠宝的神龛盖子打开了，光彩熠熠的圣体匣里，水晶圣器上放射出奇异的光芒。他身着国王的衣服站在那儿，教堂里似乎充满了上帝的荣光，连壁龛中的圣徒们也好像为之动容。他盛装站在他们面前，风琴手奏出乐曲，喇叭手吹响喇叭，唱诗班的男孩子们放声歌唱。","He stood there in the raiment of a king, and the gates of the jewelled shrine flew open, and from the crystal of the many-rayed monstrance shone a marvellous and mystical light.He stood there in a king’s raiment, and the Glory of God filled the place, and the saints in their carven niches seemed to move.In the fair raiment of a king he stood before them, and the organ pealed out its music, and the trumpeters blew upon their trumpets, and the singing boys sang."
"百姓都敬畏地跪下去，达官贵人们收回宝剑并向少年国王行礼，主教的脸色变得苍白，双手不停地颤抖。“比我伟大的神已为你加冕。”主教大声说，并跪倒在国王面前。","And the people fell upon their knees in awe, and the nobles sheathed their swords and did homage, and the Bishop’s face grew pale, and his hands trembled.“A greater than I hath crowned thee,” he cried, and he knelt before him."
"少年国王从高高的圣坛上走下来，穿过人群朝自己的寝宫走去。但没有一个人敢正视他的脸，因为他看起来如天使一般。","And the young King came down from the high altar, and passed home through the midst of the people.But no man dared look upon his face, for it was like the face of an angel."
"西班牙公主的生日","The Birthday of the Infanta"
"这天是西班牙公主的生日。她刚满12岁，这天御花园里阳光明媚。","It was the birthday of the Infanta.She was just twelve years of age, and the sun was shining brightly in the gardens of the palace."
"虽说她是一位真正的西班牙公主，但她也跟那些贫苦人家的孩子一样，一年只能过一次生日。理所当然地，全国上下都把庆祝她的生日看得很隆重，认为她生日那天应该有个好天气。刚好这天天气很好。纤长的有斑纹的郁金香亭亭玉立地开在茎端，齐整得好似一排卫兵。它们望着草地那边的玫瑰花，无不自豪地说：“现在，我们可跟你们一样绚烂啦！”紫蝴蝶四处飞舞，翅膀上还带着金色的花粉，飞过一朵又一朵鲜花；小蚯蚓爬出墙缝，慵懒地躺在阳光下；石榴咧开了嘴，露出了红彤彤的石榴籽。沿着幽暗的拱廊，破烂的花架上挂满了淡黄色的柠檬，灿烂的阳光照在上面，柠檬似乎更加亮眼了；玉兰树绽开乳白色的球状大花蕾，空气中氤氲着浓郁的芳香。","Although she was a real Princess and the Infanta of Spain, she had only one birthday every year, just like the children of quite poor people, so it was naturally a matter of great importance to the whole country that she should have a really fine day for the occasion.And a really fine day it certainly was.The tall striped tulips stood straight up upon their stalks, like long rows of soldiers, and looked defiantly across the grass at the roses, and said: “We are quite as splendid as you are now.”The purple butterflies fluttered about with gold dust on their wings, visiting each flower in turn; the little lizards crept out of the crevices of the wall, and lay basking in the white glare; and the pomegranates split and cracked with the heat, and showed their bleeding red hearts.Even the pale yellow lemons, that hung in such profusion from the mouldering trellis and along the dim arcades, seemed to have caught a richer colour from the wonderful sunlight, and the magnolia trees opened their great globe-like blossoms of folded ivory, and filled the air with a sweet heavy perfume."
"小公主自在地同伙伴们在阳台上走来走去，又围绕着石花瓶和长满青苔的古雕像玩捉迷藏。要是在平时，公主只能够和与她同等地位的孩子玩耍，所以她总是孤零零地一个人玩。不过，她生日这天却是个例外。国王下令，她可以邀请她喜欢的任何小朋友来宫中陪她一起玩。这些西班牙孩子身材颀长，走起路来姿态很高贵优雅。男孩子身穿飘逸的短披风，头戴插着大羽毛的帽子；女孩子一手提着织锦长裙的裙裾，一手用银黑色的大扇子遮挡太阳，以防晃到眼睛。但最优雅的还数小公主，她那身打扮是当时相当繁琐的样式，显得格外雅致。公主的长袍是用灰白的锦缎裁剪而成，裙摆和宽松的袖口用银线密密麻麻地缝制，结实的紧身褡上缝着几排名贵的珍珠。她的脚上穿着一双小巧的舞鞋，鞋面上有大朵粉红色的玫瑰花饰；走路时，鞋子在裙裾下若隐若现。她的手里摇着一把粉红色和珍珠色相间的大纱扇。她的头发高高束起，仿若一圈淡金色的光晕一般映着她那苍白的小脸蛋，头发上还插着一枝美丽的白玫瑰。","The little Princess herself walked up and down the terrace with her companions, and played at hide and seek round the stone vases and the old moss-grown statues.On ordinary days she was only allowed to play with children of her own rank, so she had always to play alone, but her birthday was an exception, and the King had given orders that she was to invite any of her young friends whom she liked to come and amuse themselves with her.There was a stately grace about these slim Spanish children as they glided about, the boys with their large-plumed hats and short fluttering cloaks, the girls holding up the trains of their long brocaded gowns, and shielding the sun from their eyes with huge fans of black and silver.But the Infanta was the most graceful of all, and the most tastefully attired, after the somewhat cumbrous fashion of the day.Her robe was of grey satin, the skirt and the wide puffed sleeves heavily embroidered with silver, and the stiff corset studded with rows of fine pearls.Two tiny slippers with big pink rosettes peeped out beneath her dress as she walked.Pink and pearl was her great gauze fan, and in her hair, which like an aureole of faded gold stood out stiffly round her pale little face, she had a beautiful white rose."
"此时国王正透过宫殿的一扇窗户，忧心忡忡地望着他们。国王所憎恨的兄弟——来自阿拉贡的唐佩德罗——站在他身后，而国王的告解神父——来自格拉纳达的宗教法庭大审判官——则坐在国王身边。国王比以往任何时候都更加忧郁。当他看到稚气的小公主一脸严肃地向朝中群臣行礼，或者看到她躲在扇子后面偷笑一直陪伴着她的冷酷的阿尔布奎布基公爵夫人时，他想起了年轻的王后，也就是小公主的母亲。国王对她记忆犹新，在他看来一切似乎就发生在不久前。公主的母亲离开快乐的法国，来到西班牙，但富丽堂皇却死气沉沉的西班牙宫廷很快就耗尽了她的青春活力。小公主出生六个月后，她就不幸去世了。她死得太早，甚至都没能赶得上果园里的扁桃树开第二次花，也没能赶上来年从长了木瘤的老无花果树上采摘果实。那棵无花果树栽在庭院中央，如今的庭院里杂草丛生。他太爱她了，不忍心把她埋在墓穴里，那样他就永远都看不到她了。于是国王请一位摩尔人的医生对王后的尸体用香料作了处理。有人说，这位医生因涉嫌信奉邪教和施行巫术，本已被宗教法庭判了极刑；但由于对保存王后尸体所做的贡献，国王保全了他的性命。因此，王后的尸体依然安放在铺着织锦的尸体架上，放置在宫中用黑色大理石筑成的礼拜堂中。十二年前，在一个狂风大作的三月天，修道士们把她安放在那里。十二年过去了，她容颜依旧。曾经，国王每个月都会穿着黑袍，手中提着一个遮光灯笼，走进礼拜堂，跪在她身旁呼唤着：“我的王后啊！我的王后啊！”西班牙人生活中的任何行为都受到礼节的约束，就连国王的悲痛也要有所节制。而国王有时恰恰忘了应有的礼节，悲痛欲绝地抓住王后那戴着珠宝的苍白的手，疯狂地吻她那化了妆的冰冷的脸，试图将她唤醒。","From a window in the palace the sad melancholy King watched them.Behind him stood his brother, Don Pedro of Aragon, whom he hated, and his confessor, the Grand Inquisitor of Granada, sat by his side.Sadder even than usual was the King, for as he looked at the Infanta bowing with childish gravity to the assembling counters, or laughing behind her fan at the grim Duchess of Albuquerque who always accompanied her, he thought of the young Queen, her mother, who but a short time before—so it seemed to him—had come from the gay country of  France, and had withered away in the sombre splendour of the Spanish court, dying just six months after the birth of her child, and before she had seen the almonds blossom twice in the orchard, or plucked the second year’s fruit from the old gnarled fig-tree that stood in the centre of the now grass-grown courtyard.So great had been his love for her that he had not suffered even the grave to hide her from him.She had been embalmed by a Moorish physician, who in return for this service had been granted his life, which for heresy and suspicion of magical practices had been already forfeited, men said, to the Holy Office, and her body was still lying on its tapestried bier in the black marble chapel of the Palace, just as the monks had borne her in on that windy March day nearly twelve years before.Once every month the King, wrapped in a dark cloak and with a muffled lantern in his hand, went in and knelt by her side calling out, “MI REINA!MI REINA!” and sometimes breaking through the formal etiquette that in Spain governs every separate action of life, and sets limits even to the sorrow of a King, he would clutch at the pale jewelled hands in a wild agony of grief, and try to wake by his mad kisses the cold painted face."
"今天他好像又见到她了，就跟当年在枫丹白露宫中第一次见到她时一样。当时他才十五岁，而她年纪更小。他俩就在那个时候正式订婚。订婚仪式由罗马教廷大使主持。法国国王及全体朝臣均出席了仪式。之后他就带着一小束金发返回西班牙王宫。从踏上自己的马车那刻起，他就一直回味着分别时的情景：他上马车时，她低下头用稚气的嘴唇亲吻他的手。接下来的婚礼是在布尔戈斯匆匆举行的，那是两国边境上的一座小城。随后在马德里城内举行的公开庆典场面盛大，还照例在拉·阿托卡大教堂里举行了一次大弥撒。此外，还举行了一次比平日更庄严的判处异教徒的火刑仪式。将近三百名异教徒被交由世俗权烧死，其中不少是英国人。","To-day he seemed to see her again, as he had seen her first at the Castle of Fontainebleau, when he was but fifteen years of age, and she still younger.They had been formally betrothed on that occasion by the Papal Nuncio in the presence of the French King and all the Court, and he had returned to the Escurial bearing with him a little ringlet of yellow hair, and the memory of two childish lips bending down to kiss his hand as he stepped into his carriage.Later on had followed the marriage, hastily performed at Burgos, a small town on the frontier between the two countries, and the grand public entry into Madrid with the customary celebration of high mass at the Church of La Atocha, and a more than usually solemn AUTO-DA-FE, in which nearly three hundred heretics, amongst whom were many Englishmen, had been delivered over to the secular arm to be burned."
"他爱她真是爱得发疯，很多人据此认为是他把王国毁了，因为当时他们正与英格兰为争夺新世界的霸主地位而争战。他甚至一刻也不能离开她。为了她，他已经忘记了或者近乎忘记了王国的一切大事。这种激情使他变得极度盲目。他甚至没有意识到，为讨她欢心而绞尽脑汁想出的种种繁文缛节反而加重了一直困扰她的怪病。她死后的一段时间里，他也变得神志不清。若不是担心离去后小公主会受到自己兄弟的残害，国王一定会正式退位并隐居在格拉纳达的特拉卜教大寺院里。他已经是该院的名誉副院长了。他兄弟的残酷无情在西班牙是出了名的，很多人怀疑是他害死了王后。传说王后走访他所在的阿拉贡城堡时，他送了一双有毒的手套给王后。国王曾以皇家法令宣布举国上下为死去的王后哀悼三年，即便三年期满之后，他仍然忌讳大臣们跟他提起再娶妻的事。当罗马帝国皇帝亲自来向他提出把自己的侄女——一位美丽可爱的波西米亚女大公嫁给他时，他仍吩咐使臣去告诉罗马皇帝，说西班牙国王已经和悲伤联姻，尽管她只是一个不能生育的新娘，可他爱她超过了任何佳丽。这个回复的代价是使他的王国失去了尼德兰的许多富饶的省份。这些省份不久便在罗马皇帝的煽动下，在一些狂热的改革教派信徒的领导下，发起了叛乱。","Certainly he had loved her madly, and to the ruin, many thought, of his country, then at war with England for the possession of the empire of the New World.He had hardly ever permitted her to be out of his sight; for her, he had forgotten, or seemed to have forgotten, all grave affairs of State; and, with that terrible blindness that passion brings upon its servants, he had failed to notice that the elaborate ceremonies by which he sought to please her did but aggravate the strange malady from which she suffered.When she died he was, for a time, like one bereft of reason.Indeed, there is no doubt but that he would have formally abdicated and retired to the great Trappist monastery at Granada, of which he was already titular Prior, had he not been afraid to leave the little Infanta at the mercy of his brother, whose cruelty, even in Spain, was notorious, and who was suspected by many of having caused the Queen’s death by means of a pair of poisoned gloves that he had presented to her on the occasion of her visiting his castle in Aragon.Even after the expiration of the three years of public mourning that he had ordained throughout his whole dominions by royal edict, he would never suffer his ministers to speak about any new alliance, and when the Emperor himself sent to him, and offered him the hand of the lovely Archduchess of Bohemia, his niece, in marriage, he bade the ambassadors tell their master that the King of Spain was already wedded to Sorrow, and that though she was but a barren bride he loved her better than Beauty; an answer that cost his crown the rich provinces of the Netherlands, which soon after, at the Emperor’s instigation, revolted against him under the leadership of some fanatics of the Reformed Church."
"当今天他凝望着在阳台上玩耍的小公主时，他整个的婚姻生活，那曾给他带来了火一般热烈的欢愉，同时也因突如其来的终结而导致了难以承受的痛苦，如今似乎又历历在目。小公主拥有王后一切可爱而又傲慢的举止特征，一样任性的摆头动作，一样秀丽而又饱满的美丽嘴唇，一样美丽可人的微笑——的确是法国式的微笑——她时不时地翘首望望窗户，或伸出她的小手让高贵的西班牙绅士亲吻。然而，他觉得孩子们的笑声很刺耳，明媚的阳光也像是在无情地嘲弄他的悲伤。某种像是防腐香料的怪异而沉闷的气味似乎将早晨清新的空气都给弄浊了——抑或眼前这一切都只是幻觉？他双手掩面。等小公主再次抬头时，窗帘已经拉下，国王也离开了。","His whole married life, with its fierce, fiery-coloured joys and the terrible agony of its sudden ending, seemed to come back to him to-day as he watched the Infanta playing on the terrace.She had all the Queen’s pretty petulance of manner, the same wilful way of tossing her head, the same proud curved beautiful mouth, the same wonderful smile—VRAI SOURIRE DE FRANCE indeed—as she glanced up now and then at the window, or stretched out her little hand for the stately Spanish gentlemen to kiss.But the shrill laughter of the children grated on his ears, and the bright pitiless sunlight mocked his sorrow, and a dull odour of strange spices, spices such as embalmers use, seemed to taint—or was it fancy? —the clear morning air.He buried his face in his hands, and when the Infanta looked up again the curtains had been drawn, and the King had retired."
"小公主有些失望地撅了撅嘴，耸了耸肩。按理说，他应该陪她一起过生日的。那些无聊的政务又有什么要紧？还是他又去了那个一直点着蜡烛的阴森森的礼拜堂，那个他从来都不容许她进去的地方？阳光如此明媚，所有人都笑逐颜开，他可真是太傻了！再说，他还会错过一场由人假扮的斗牛比赛，比赛的号角已经吹响了。另外还有木偶戏和其他精彩的表演。她的叔叔和宗教法庭大审判官倒是更近人情。他们都来到阳台上，并向她道贺。小公主摇摇可爱的脑袋，拉着唐佩德罗的手，缓缓走下台阶，朝搭在花园尽头的紫绸长看台走去。其他孩子都井井有序地跟在她身后——谁的名字最长，谁就走在最前头。","She made a little MOUE of disappointment, and shrugged her shoulders.Surely he might have stayed with her on her birthday.What did the stupid State-affairs matter?Or had he gone to that gloomy chapel, where the candles were always burning, and where she was never allowed to enter?How silly of him, when the sun was shining so brightly, and everybody was so happy!Besides, he would miss the sham bull-fight for which the trumpet was already sounding, to say nothing of the puppet-show and the other wonderful things.Her uncle and the Grand Inquisitor were much more sensible.They had come out on the terrace, and paid her nice compliments.So she tossed her pretty head, and taking Don Pedro by the hand, she walked slowly down the steps towards a long pavilion of purple silk that had been erected at the end of the garden, the other children following in strict order of precedence, those who had the longest names going first."
"一列由贵族男孩子精心装扮的斗牛士队伍走出来欢迎她。年少的努埃瓦伯爵，一位约莫十四岁的美少年，尽显西班牙贵族世家的温文尔雅，向小公主脱帽致敬，并庄重地把她引到竞技场。场内搭了一个看台，上面有一把镶金的象牙小椅子，小公主就坐在上面。其他孩子有序地环绕在她身边，他们一边摇着手中的大扇子，一边交头接耳。唐佩德罗和宗教法庭大审判官面带微笑地站在入口处。就连那位女公爵——人称女市长——一个瘦小、面貌凶恶、戴着黄色轮状皱领的女人，也一改平日凶巴巴的神情。仿佛有一丝冷冷的笑意拂过她那皱巴巴的脸庞，连苍白干瘪的嘴唇也抽动了一下。","A procession of noble boys, fantastically dressed as TOREADORS, came out to meet her, and the young Count of Tierra-Nueva, a wonderfully handsome lad of about fourteen years of age, uncovering his head with all the grace of a born hidalgo and grandee of Spain, led her solemnly in to a little gilt and ivory chair that was placed on a raised dais above the arena.The children grouped themselves all round, fluttering their big fans and whispering to each other, and Don Pedro and the Grand Inquisitor stood laughing at the entrance.Even the Duchess—the Camerera-Mayor as she was called—a thin, hard-featured woman with a yellow ruff, did not look quite so bad-tempered as usual, and something like a chill smile flitted across her wrinkled face and twitched her thin bloodless lips."
"这真是一场令人叫绝的斗牛赛，小公主心想，它比货真价实的斗牛还要好看。记得还是在帕马公爵来拜访她的父亲时，她曾被带到塞维尔观赏过一场真正的斗牛赛。一群男孩子骑着盛装打扮的木马，在场子里神气十足地挥舞着系着艳丽丝带的长矛；另外一些男孩子徒步走着，在假牛面前舞动着猩红披风。当假牛冲过来时，他们就轻快地跳过栅栏，躲过袭击。至于那“牛”，别看它只是用柳条和有韧性的兽皮做的，可跟真的牛一样生龙活虎。不过连真牛做梦也想不到的是，它可以一直用后腿绕着场子跑。它的表现非常出色，孩子们兴奋极了，纷纷起身站在长凳上，挥动手中的丝帕，大声欢呼：太棒了！太棒了！那评头论足的派头俨然像大人一般。然而，随着比赛的愈战愈烈，好几匹木马最后都给戳倒了。那位年轻的努埃尔伯爵用膝盖把牛压住，在得到公主的许可后用木剑狠狠地朝牛的脖子刺去，给了牛致命一击。他用劲过猛，一下子就戳掉了牛头。这逗得法国驻马德里大使的儿子小洛兰先生笑逐颜开。","It certainly was a marvellous bull-fight, and much nicer, the Infanta thought, than the real bull-fight that she had been brought to see at Seville, on the occasion of the visit of the Duke of Parma to her father.Some of the boys pranced about on richly-caparisoned hobby-horses brandishing long javelins with gay streamers of bright ribands attached to them; others went on foot waving their scarlet cloaks before the bull, and vaulting lightly over the barrier when he charged them; and as for the bull himself, he was just like a live bull, though he was only made of wicker-work and stretched hide, and sometimes insisted on running round the arena on his hind legs, which no live bull ever dreams of doing.He made a splendid fight of it too, and the children got so excited that they stood up upon the benches, and waved their lace handkerchiefs and cried out: BRAVO TORO! BRAVO TORO! just as sensibly as if they had been grown-up people.At last, however, after a prolonged combat, during which several of the hobby-horses were gored through and through, and, their riders dismounted, the young Count of Tierra-Nueva brought the bull to his knees, and having obtained permission from the Infanta to give the COUP DE GRACE, he plunged his wooden sword into the neck of the animal with such violence that the head came right off, and disclosed the laughing face of little Monsieur de Lorraine, the son of the French Ambassador at Madrid."
"接下来，在大家的掌声中，竞技场被收拾干净了。两个身穿黄黑制服的摩尔人侍从郑重地拖走了倒地的木马。接着是一个幕间节目，一位来自法国的柔软体操教师在一根绷紧的绳子上进行了表演。紧接着，一些意大利木偶戏演员出现在小戏院里一个特意为他们准备的舞台上，上演了半古典悲剧《莎福尼士巴》。木偶们表演得活灵活现，简直是太棒了。演出结束时，小公主感动得泪眼朦胧。确实有不少孩子感动得哭了，因此人们不得不去拿糖果安慰他们。就连宗教法庭大审判官也深受感动，他忍不住对唐佩德罗说，这些不过是用木头和彩色蜡做成、又机械地任由丝线摆布的东西，竟能演绎出如此悲伤和不幸的故事，这在他看来似乎非常难以接受。","The arena was then cleared amidst much applause, and the dead hobbyhorses dragged solemnly away by two Moorish pages in yellow and black liveries, and after a short interlude, during which a French posture-master performed upon the tightrope, some Italian puppets appeared in the semi-classical tragedy of Sophonisba on the stage of a small theatre that had been built up for the purpose.They acted so well, and their gestures were so extremely natural, that at the close of the play the eyes of the Infanta were quite dim with tears.Indeed some of the children really cried, and had to be comforted with sweetmeats, and the Grand Inquisitor himself was so affected that he could not help saying to Don Pedro that it seemed to him intolerable that things made simply out of wood and coloured wax, and worked mechanically by wires, should be so unhappy and meet with such terrible misfortunes."
"之后上场的是一名来自非洲的魔法师。他提来一只又大又平的篮子，上面盖着一块红布。把篮子放在场地中央后，他从自己的包头巾里取出一根奇特的芦笛，开始吹起来。不一会儿，布开始动起来。随着芦笛声越来越尖，一黄一绿两条蛇探出了它们古怪的楔形头，并且慢慢越伸越长。它们的脑袋还随着笛声摇来晃去，就跟植物在水中摇动一样。孩子们看见它们那有斑点的颈部皮褶和快速吐出的舌头时反而害怕起来，而看见魔术师在沙地上变出一棵小橘树，树上开着十分洁白的花朵，还当真结了一串串橘子后，他们又开心起来。后来魔术师拿起拉斯托雷斯侯爵小女儿手中的扇子，把它变成了一只蓝色的小鸟，小鸟唱着歌，在场内飞来飞去。那会儿孩子们真是无比地兴奋和惊讶。毕拉尔圣母院礼拜堂跳舞班的男孩们也表演了庄严的小步舞曲，同样引人入胜。小公主以前从未见过如此盛大的庆典。这种庆典每年五月在圣母大祭坛前举办一次，是专为纪念圣母而举行的。其实，自从一位疯教士(据许多人讲他被英国女王伊丽莎白收买)企图用一块有毒的薄饼毒害西班牙太子阿斯图里亚斯以后，就没有哪位西班牙王储敢再次踏入萨拉戈萨大教堂了。所以小公主以前仅仅是听人说过《圣母之舞》，今天见识了才知道确实很精彩。男孩们穿着白色天鹅绒做的老式宫廷服装，他们那奇特的三角帽上缀着银饰物，帽顶插着大片的鸵鸟毛。他们在阳光下翩翩起舞，耀眼的白色服饰在他们黝黑面容和长长黑发的衬托下显得更加夺目。所有的人都被他们的一举一动给迷住了，只见他们在繁杂的舞蹈动作中一直都显得很庄重，舒缓的舞姿得体而优雅，连鞠躬的动作也气度不凡。舞曲一结束，他们立即脱下大羽毛帽子向小公主致敬，她很有礼貌地进行了回礼，并许诺送一只大蜡烛给皮拉尔圣母的神坛，以回报圣母给她带来的快乐。","An African juggler followed, who brought in a large flat basket covered with a red cloth, and having placed it in the centre of the arena, he took from his turban a curious reed pipe, and blew through it.In a few moments the cloth began to move, and as the pipe grew shriller and shriller two green and gold snakes put out their strange wedge-shaped heads and rose slowly up, swaying to and fro with the music as a plant sways in the water.The children, however, were rather frightened at their spotted hoods and quick darting tongues, and were much more pleased when the juggler made a tiny orange-tree grow out of the sand and bear pretty white blossoms and clusters of real fruit; and when he took the fan of the little daughter of the Marquess de Las-Torres, and changed it into a blue bird that flew all round the pavilion and sang, their delight and amazement knew no bounds.The solemn minuet, too, performed by the dancing boys from the church of Nuestra Senora Del Pilar, was charming.The Infanta had never before seen this wonderful ceremony which takes place every year at Maytime in front of the high altar of the Virgin, and in her honour; and indeed none of the royal family of Spain had entered the great cathedral of Saragossa since a mad priest, supposed by many to have been in the pay of Elizabeth of England, had tried to administer a poisoned wafer to the Prince of the Asturias.So she had known only by hearsay of “Our Lady’s Dance,” as it was called, and it certainly was a beautiful sight.The boys wore old-fashioned court dresses of white velvet, and their curious three-cornered hats were fringed with silver and surmounted with huge plumes of ostrich feathers, the dazzling whiteness of their costumes, as they moved about in the sunlight, being still more accentuated by their swarthy faces and long black hair.Everybody was fascinated by the grave dignity with which they moved through the intricate figures of the dance, and by the elaborate grace of their slow gestures, and stately bows, and when they had finished their performance and doffed their great plumed hats to the Infanta, she acknowledged their reverence with much courtesy, and made a vow that she would send a large wax candle to the shrine of Our Lady of Pilar in return for the pleasure that she had given her."
"这时一队气宇轩昂的埃及人——当时也被称为吉卜赛人——进场了。他们盘腿席地而坐，围成一圈，开始轻轻地弹起齐特琴，身子还和着曲子动起来。他们很轻很轻地哼着一支低沉、轻柔的曲子。这些人一看到唐佩德罗就皱起了眉头，有的人还露出了惊恐的表情。因为就在几周之前，唐佩德罗在塞维尔集市里绞死了他们的两个族人，说他们施行妖术。不过美丽的小公主使他们着了迷。她向后斜靠着，把姣好的脸庞藏在扇子后面，一双蓝色的大眼睛从扇子上边望着他们。他们相信像她这样可爱的人绝不会残忍地对待别人的。于是，他们继续轻轻地弹着琴。他们长长的尖指甲一触到琴弦，头便朝前点，仿佛要入睡似的。突然传来了一声尖叫，孩子们全都大吃一惊，而唐佩德罗立马抓住了短剑的玛瑙柄部圆头。只见弹琴的人跳起来，围着场地疯狂地转圈，并不停地敲打手鼓，同时用他们那带喉音的古怪语言唱起了狂放的情歌。接着，在另一个暗号之后，他们立刻扑倒在地上，静静地躺着不动，全场一片寂静，只能听到单调的弦琴声。他们这样来回表演了几次之后，又退出了一会儿；等再回来时，他们用链条牵出来了一只毛茸茸的棕色大熊，他们肩上还蹲着几只瘦小的无尾猴。大熊有模有样地表演倒立，干瘦的猴子跟着两个像是它们主人的吉卜赛小男孩表演了各种各样搞笑的把戏。它们还会挥动小剑和开枪，并且会像国王的卫队那样完成一整套正规军的操练。吉卜赛人的表演确实大获成功。","A troop of handsome Egyptians—as the gipsies were termed in those days—then advanced into the arena, and sitting down cross-legs, in a circle, began to play softly upon their zithers, moving their bodies to the tune, and humming, almost below their breath, a low dreamy air.When they caught sight of Don Pedro they scowled at him, and some of them looked terrified, for only a few weeks before he had had two of their tribe hanged for sorcery in the market-place at Seville, but the pretty Infanta charmed them as she leaned back peeping over her fan with her great blue eyes, and they felt sure that one so lovely as she was could never be cruel to anybody.So they played on very gently and just touching the cords of the zithers with their long pointed nails, and their heads began to nod as though they were falling asleep.Suddenly, with a cry so shrill that all the children were startled and Don Pedro’s hand clutched at the agate pommel of his dagger, they leapt to their feet and whirled madly round the enclosure beating their tambourines, and chaunting some wild love-song in their strange guttural language.Then at another signal they all flung themselves again to the ground and lay there quite still, the dull strumming of the zithers being the only sound that broke the silence.After that they had done this several times, they disappeared for a moment and came back leading a brown shaggy bear by a chain, and carrying on their shoulders some little Barbary apes.The bear stood upon his head with the utmost gravity, and the wizened apes played all kinds of amusing tricks with two gipsy boys who seemed to be their masters, and fought with tiny swords, and fired off guns, and went through a regular soldier’s drill just like the King’s own bodyguard.In fact the gipsies were a great success."
"不过整个上午的娱乐活动中，最有趣的还数小矮人的舞蹈。当他一颠一簸地挪动扭曲的腿，左右摇晃着畸形的大脑袋，跌跌撞撞地走进场子时，孩子们都不约而同地欢呼起来。小公主本人更是大笑不止，以致于那位女侍从市长不得不提醒她说，虽然过去西班牙国王的女儿在同等身份的人面前哭过几回，可从没有哪位皇室公主在比她地位低下的人跟前如此开怀大笑过。可是小矮人的表演确实滑稽得让人忍不住想笑。哪怕是西班牙宫廷这样一个任何刺激都能唾手可得的地方，以前也从未出现过如此吸引人的一个小怪物。这也是他头一回抛头露面。他是在公主生日的前一天才被发现的。当时他正在森林里尽情地跑着，两个贵族恰好在环城一带的软木林里某个偏僻的地方打猎，于是他们就把他带到宫中，作为一个生日惊喜献给小公主。小矮人的父亲是个穷苦的烧炭翁，能够摆脱这个又丑又没用的孩子对他来说真是求之不得。最滑稽的恐怕是小矮人本人一点儿也不知道自己的相貌有多么怪异。他反而看上去非常开心且精神饱满。孩子们都笑了，他也跟他们一样笑得无拘无束。每支舞曲结束时，他都以最滑稽的方式向他们一一鞠躬，并点头微笑，俨如他们中的一员，而不像是造化用滑稽的方式刻意创造出来让别人戏弄的一个不幸的小怪物。至于公主，小矮人完全被她迷住了。小矮人一刻也不能把眼睛从她身上移开，好像他是专为小公主一人跳舞似的。演出结束时，小公主想起了自己曾见过宫廷贵妇们向意大利著名男高音加法奈里抛掷花束的情景。当时罗马教皇把加法奈里从自己的礼拜堂派往马德里，试图用他那无比甜美的歌声去医治国王的忧愁。于是小公主取下自己头发上那朵美丽的白玫瑰，半是开玩笑半是戏弄女侍从市长似的，把花抛向场中的小矮人，还献上了最甜美的笑容。不过小矮人当真了，他将白玫瑰按在自己粗糙的嘴唇上，又把手放在胸口，单膝跪在小公主面前，咧嘴大笑，亮晶晶的小眼睛里放出快乐的光芒。","But the funniest part of the whole morning’s entertainment, was undoubtedly the dancing of the little Dwarf.When he stumbled into the arena, waddling on his crooked legs and wagging his huge misshapen head from side to side, the children went off into a loud shout of delight, and the Infanta herself laughed so much that the Camerera was obliged to remind her that although there were many precedents in Spain for a King’s daughter weeping before her equals, there were none for a Princess of the blood royal making so merry before those who were her inferiors in birth.The Dwarf, however, was really quite irresistible, and even at the Spanish Court, always noted for its cultivated passion for the horrible, so fantastic a little monster had never been seen.It was his first appearance, too.He had been discovered only the day before, running wild through the forest, by two of the nobles who happened to have been hunting in a remote part of the great cork-wood that surrounded the town, and had been carried off by them to the Palace as a surprise for the Infanta; his father, who was a poor charcoal-burner, being but too well pleased to get rid of so ugly and useless a child.Perhaps the most amusing thing about him was his complete unconsciousness of his own grotesque appearance.Indeed he seemed quite happy and full of the highest spirits.When the children laughed, he laughed as freely and as joyously as any of them, and at the close of each dance he made them each the funniest of bows, smiling and nodding at them just as if he was really one of themselves, and not a little misshapen thing that Nature, in some humourous mood, had fashioned for others to mock at.As for the Infanta, she absolutely fascinated him.He could not keep his eyes off her, and seemed to dance for her alone, and when at the close of the performance, remembering how she had seen the great ladies of the Court throw bouquets to Caffarelli, the famous Italian treble, whom the Pope had sent from his own chapel to Madrid that he might cure the King’s melancholy by the sweetness of his voice, she took out of her hair the beautiful white rose, and partly for a jest and partly to tease the Camerera, threw it to him across the arena with her sweetest smile, he took the whole matter quite seriously, and pressing the flower to his rough coarse lips he put his hand upon his heart, and sank on one knee before her, grinning from ear to ear, and with his little bright eyes sparkling with pleasure."
"这使小公主不再保持庄严，等小矮人跑出场子好一阵子后她还在一个劲地笑，并对她的叔叔表示还想马上看小矮人表演舞蹈。然而那位女侍从市长恳求说太阳照得太热了，公主殿下应该马上回到宫里；那里已经为她备好了丰盛的宴席和一个生日大蛋糕，蛋糕上用各色糖汁拼写出了她名字的大写字母，上面还飘扬着一面小银旗。于是小公主非常庄重地站起来，命令小矮人在她午睡后再表演一次，还表示将她的谢意转达给年轻的努埃瓦伯爵，感谢他的盛情款待。接着她就回宫了，其他孩子又按来时的次序跟在她后面。","This so upset the gravity of the Infanta that she kept on laughing long after the little Dwarf had ran out of the arena, and expressed a desire to her uncle that the dance should be immediately repeated.The Camerera, however, on the plea that the sun was too hot, decided that it would be better that her Highness should return without delay to the Palace, where a wonderful feast had been already prepared for her, including a real birthday cake with her own initials worked all over it in painted sugar and a lovely silver flag waving from the top.The Infanta accordingly rose up with much dignity, and having given orders that the little dwarf was to dance again for her after the hour of siesta, and conveyed her thanks to the young Count of Tierra-Nueva for his charming reception, she went back to her apartments, the children following in the same order in which they had entered."
"当得知有第二次机会到小公主面前表演，而且这还是小公主亲自下令的消息时，小矮人得意万分。他跑进花园，欣喜若狂地亲吻着那朵白玫瑰，忘乎所以地做出了很多笨拙而难看的动作。","Now when the little Dwarf heard that he was to dance a second time before the Infanta, and by her own express command, he was so proud that he ran out into the garden, kissing the white rose in an absurd ecstasy of pleasure, and making the most uncouth and clumsy gestures of delight."
"花儿们对小矮人如此莽撞地闯进她们美丽家园的行为感到非常愤怒。看见他在花廊里跳来跳去，还十分可笑地举着双手挥舞着，她们实在是忍无可忍。","The Flowers were quite indignant at his daring to intrude into their beautiful home, and when they saw him capering up and down the walks, and waving his arms above his head in such a ridiculous manner, they could not restrain their feelings any longer."
"“他真是太难看了，根本不配到我们这里来。”郁金香嚷道。","“He is really far too ugly to be allowed to play in any place where we are,” cried the Tulips."
"“他应该去喝罂粟汁，然后睡上一千年。”红色的大百合花说，它们也变得恼怒万分。","“He should drink poppy-juice, and go to sleep for a thousand years,” said the great scarlet Lilies, and they grew quite hot and angry."
"“他是个十足的怪物！”仙人掌尖叫道，“瞧，他体形古怪，长得又矮又胖，头跟腿还不成比例。他确实使我浑身上下不舒服。他要是靠近我，我就用我的刺去扎他。”“而他竟然得到了我最美的一朵花。”白玫瑰树喊道，“那朵花是我今天早上亲自送给小公主的生日礼物，他却把花偷走了。”于是白玫瑰大声叫道：“强盗！强盗！强盗！”声音大得不能再大了。","“He is a perfect horror!” screamed the Cactus.“Why, he is twisted and stumpy, and his head is completely out of proportion with his legs.Really he makes me feel prickly all over, and if he comes near me I will sting him with my thorns.” “And he has actually got one of my best blooms,” exclaimed the White Rose-Tree.“I gave it to the Infanta this morning myself, as a birthday present, and he has stolen it from her.”And she called out: “Thief, thief, thief!” at the top of her voice."
"就连平日不爱抛头露面的红色天竺葵，这种众所周知有很多穷亲戚的植物，看见小矮人时也都厌恶地卷起身子。紫罗兰却温和地说小矮人确实其貌不扬，可他自己也没办法。紫罗兰十分公正地替小矮人辩驳，表示生得丑陋的确是他主要的缺陷，可人们不该因为他的不治之症而嘲弄他。其实，也有好些紫罗兰觉得小矮人的丑态是他故意卖弄出来的，假如他面带些愁容，或至少表现出沉思的样子，而不是欢乐地跳上跳下，显得自己古怪而又傻乎乎的，那么他会让人觉得好受许多。","Even the red Geraniums, who did not usually give themselves airs, and were known to have a great many poor relations themselves, curled up in disgust when they saw him, and when the Violets meekly remarked that though he was certainly extremely plain, still he could not help it, they retorted with a good deal of justice that that was his chief defect, and that there was no reason why one should admire a person because he was incurable; and, indeed, some of the Violets themselves felt that the ugliness of the little Dwarf was almost ostentatious, and that he would have shown much better taste if he had looked sad, or at least pensive, instead of jumping about merrily, and throwing himself into such grotesque and silly attitudes."
"至于老日晷仪，他是一位非常了不起的人物，曾经专职向查理五世陛下一人汇报每天的时刻。小矮人的模样让他震惊不已，竟使他几乎忘记用他那长长的有影子的指头标出时间长达两分之久。它忍不住对在栏杆上晒太阳的乳白色大孔雀说，谁都知道龙生龙凤生凤，老鼠的儿子会打洞，要想改变这个事实还真是很难；孔雀完全赞同老日晷仪的高见，并附和着叫起来：“确实，确实。”她的声音又大又尖，连在凉爽的喷水池中的金鱼们也好奇地从水中探出脑袋，询问巨石特赖登究竟发生了什么事。","As for the old Sundial, who was an extremely remarkable individual, and had once told the time of day to no less a person than the Emperor Charles V. himself, he was so taken aback by the little Dwarf’s appearance, that he almost forgot to mark two whole minutes with his long shadowy finger, and could not help saying to the great milk-white Peacock, who was sunning herself on the balustrade, that every one knew that the children of Kings were Kings, and that the children of charcoal-burners were charcoal-burners, and that it was absurd to pretend that it wasn’t so; a statement with which the Peacock entirely agreed, and indeed screamed out, “Certainly, certainly,” in such a loud, harsh voice, that the gold-fish who lived in the basin of the cool splashing fountain put their heads out of the water, and asked the huge stone Tritons what on earth was the matter."
"不过，鸟儿们却很喜欢小矮人。它们常在森林里见到小矮人。有时他像个精灵似的，追赶着在空中打着转飞舞的落叶，有时他蹲在一棵老橡树的洞口，与松鼠们一起分享他的坚果。他们毫不在意他的相貌丑陋。是啊，连夜晚在橘园里放声歌唱的夜莺，月亮有时也会俯身聆听它那甜美的歌声，其实它也没有什么好看的。再说，小矮人过去对它们一直都很好，哪怕是在那个严寒的冬天，树上已经没有了浆果，地面被冻得坚硬如铁，狼群也下山逼近城门口寻找食物，但小矮人从未忘记它们。小矮人总是把自己本来就很少的黑面包揉成屑给它们吃，而且不管他的早餐多么少，他总会分一些给它们。","But somehow the Birds liked him.They had seen him often in the forest, dancing about like an elf after the eddying leaves, or crouched up in the hollow of some old oak-tree, sharing his nuts with the squirrels.They did not mind his being ugly, a bit.Why, even the nightingale herself, who sang so sweetly in the orange groves at night that sometimes the Moon leaned down to listen, was not much to look at after all; and, besides, he had been kind to them, and during that terribly bitter winter, when there were no berries on the trees, and the ground was as hard as iron, and the wolves had come down to the very gates of the city to look for food, he had never once forgotten them, but had always given them crumbs out of his little hunch of black bread, and divided with them whatever poor breakfast he had."
"鸟儿绕着他飞了一圈又一圈，飞过他身边时还用翅膀轻轻地抚摸他的脸，并相互说笑着。小矮人高兴得不得了，他忍不住把那朵美丽的白玫瑰拿出来给它们看，还告诉它们这是小公主亲自送给他的，因为小公主爱他。","So they flew round and round him, just touching his cheek with their wings as they passed, and chattered to each other, and the little Dwarf was so pleased that he could not help showing them the beautiful white rose, and telling them that the Infanta herself had given it to him because she loved him."
"它们一个字也没听懂他在说什么，不过这倒也没什么关系。它们齐刷刷地把头摆向一个方向，看上去很明白他的样子；这和表示出理解殊途同归，并且直白多了。","They did not understand a single word of what he was saying, but that made no matter, for they put their heads on one side, and looked wise, which is quite as good as understanding a thing, and very much easier."
"蜥蜴也非常喜欢他。每当他跑累了躺在草地上休息时，蜥蜴就会在他身上玩耍嬉闹，使出浑身解数逗他开心。“不是每个人都能像蜥蜴那样美丽，”他们大声说道，“这种要求也太过分了。尽管听起来未免有些荒唐，他其实也不是那么难看，当然，前提是只要人们闭上眼睛，不要去看他。”蜥蜴天生就具备了十足的哲学家派头，在无事可做或是碰上雨天不能出门的时候，它们就会一坐好几个钟头苦思冥想。","The Lizards also took an immense fancy to him, and when he grew tired of running about and flung himself down on the grass to rest, they played and romped all over him, and tried to amuse him in the best way they could.“Every one cannot be as beautiful as a lizard,” they cried; “that would be too much to expect.And, though it sounds absurd to say so, he is really not so ugly after all, provided, of course, that one shuts one’s eyes, and does not look at him.”The Lizards were extremely philosophical by nature, and often sat thinking for hours and hours together, when there was nothing else to do, or when the weather was too rainy for them to go out."
"然而，花儿对它们的行为倒是很生气，对鸟儿的行为也很恼火。“这只能说明，”花儿们说，“这么不停地横冲直撞、飞来飞去会产生多么粗俗的影响。像我们这样有教养的人，总是老老实实地呆在同一个地方。从没有谁看见我们在花廊里蹦来蹦去，抑或在草丛里发疯一样追赶蜻蜓。当我们确实要换换空气时，我们就会叫来园丁，他会把我们搬到另一个花圃。这是很尊贵的事，而且我们值得如此礼遇。可鸟儿和蜥蜴们一点儿都不知道休息，况且鸟儿甚至连个固定的栖息地都不曾有。它们只不过是一群像吉卜赛人那样的流浪汉，活该受到同样的待遇。”花儿个个趾高气扬，一副很神气的样子，得意地望着小矮人从草地上爬起来，穿过阳台朝宫廷走去。","The Flowers, however, were excessively annoyed at their behaviour, and at the behaviour of the birds.“It only shows,” they said, “what a vulgarising effect this incessant rushing and flying about has.Well-bred people always stay exactly in the same place, as we do.No one ever saw us hopping up and down the walks, or galloping madly through the grass after dragon-flies.When we do want change of air, we send for the gardener, and he carries us to another bed.This is dignified, and as it should be.But birds and lizards have no sense of repose, and indeed birds have not even a permanent address.They are mere vagrants like the gipsies, and should be treated in exactly the same manner.”So they put their noses in the air, and looked very haughty, and were quite delighted when after some time they saw the little Dwarf scramble up from the grass, and make his way across the terrace to the palace."
"“他应该一辈子都关在房子里不出门，”它们说,“看看他的驼背，还有他的瘸腿。”说着它们嗤嗤地笑了起来。","“He should certainly be kept indoors for the rest of his natural life,” they said.“Look at his hunched back, and his crooked legs,” and they began to titter."
"不过小矮人对此都一无所知。他十分喜欢这些小鸟和蜥蜴，而且他还认为花儿是世界上最美丽的东西，当然最美的花儿也比不上小公主美丽。不过当小公主将这朵美丽的白玫瑰送给他，表明她是爱他的之后，那就大不一样了。他多么希望自己能跟她一起回到宫中！她会让他坐在她的右手边，对他微笑；他会一刻也不愿从她身边走开，他要成为她的玩伴，并教她各种逗乐的把戏。尽管他以前没进过王宫，但他了解许多有趣的事情。他能用灯心草编出小笼子，把蚱蜢关在里面唱歌；他还能把长有竹节的长竹子做成笛子，吹出牧神潘最爱听的曲子。　　　　他能识别出每只鸟儿的叫声，能唤出树梢上的欧椋鸟和湖中的鹭。他辨得出每种动物的脚印，可以凭着淡淡的脚印找到野兔，靠被踩过的树叶找到野猪。他了解风各种各样的舞姿：有秋天里穿着红衣的狂舞，有夏天里穿着蓝色凉鞋、掠过麦穗的轻舞，有冬季顶着白色雪冠起舞，还有春天里在果园中与花朵共舞。他知道斑鸠在什么地方筑巢。有一回斑鸠妈妈和斑鸠爸爸给猎人抓走了，他就亲自喂养幼鸟，并在一棵砍去了树梢的榆树裂缝中为他们搭了一个小小的鸽房。它们都很听话，并习惯了每天清早在他的手心找东西吃。小公主会喜欢它们的，还有那些在长长的厥类植物丛中乱窜的兔子、长着硬羽毛和黑嘴的松鸦、能够蜷曲成刺球的刺猬，以及会摇头摆尾、轻轻咬嫩叶、慢慢爬行的聪明的大乌龟。是的，她一定会愿意跟他到森林里去，和他一起玩耍的。他会把自己的小床让给她睡，自己在窗外守到天亮，不让带角的野兽伤害她，更不会让饥饿的狼群靠近小茅屋。天亮后，他会轻轻地敲响窗户把她唤醒，他俩便跑出去，跳上一整天的舞。在森林里从不会有寂寞的时候。有时主教会骑着他的白骡子经过这里，一边走一边朗声读着一本画册。有时头戴绿绒帽子、身穿棕黄色鹿皮短上衣的养鹰者从这儿经过，他们的手腕上还立着蒙头罩的鹰。每到葡萄收获的季节，酿葡萄酒的人就来了。他们头戴常青藤编制的花环，全身上下都是紫色的葡萄，手中拿着还在渗漏的酒囊。烧炭人晚上围坐在大火盆边，望着干柴慢慢地燃烧殆尽。他们还把栗子埋在火灰中烤着吃，连强盗们也从山洞里窜出来跟他们一块儿玩乐。还有一次，他看见一支庄严的队伍沿着尘土飞扬的大路朝托莱多蜿蜒行进。修道士走在队伍的前头，他们手持鲜艳的旗帜和金十字架，边走边轻轻哼唱着。紧跟其后的是身披银盔甲、手执火绳枪和长矛的士兵。在这些士兵里头有三个手持燃着的蜡烛、打着赤脚的人。他们身穿古怪的黄衫，上面绘满了美妙的图案。说真的，森林里有太多值得一看的东西。她要是玩累了，他便会为她找一个长满苔藓的软堤，或者把她抱在怀中，让她休息。他知道自己不够高，不过力气还是有的。他会用红色的蔓草浆果给她串起一条项链，会和她裙子上的白色浆果一样美丽。她要是厌倦了这些东西，她可以扔掉，然后他再去找其他的东西。他会为她采摘橡树上的花蕾、带露水的银莲花，还会为她捉来萤火虫，放在她的头发里，那样她淡金色的头发就会一闪一闪的，像是藏着一颗颗小星星在里面。","But the little Dwarf knew nothing of all this.He liked the birds and the lizards immensely, and thought that the flowers were the most marvellous things in the whole world, except of course the Infanta, but then she had given him the beautiful white rose, and she loved him, and that made a great difference.How he wished that he had gone back with her!She would have put him on her right hand, and smiled at him, and he would have never left her side, but would have made her his playmate, and taught her all kinds of delightful tricks.For though he had never been in a palace before, he knew a great many wonderful things.He could make little cages out of rushes for the grasshoppers to sing in, and fashion the long jointed bamboo into the pipe that Pan loves to hear.He knew the cry of every bird, and could call the starlings from the tree-top, or the heron from the mere.He knew the trail of every animal, and could track the hare by its delicate footprints, and the boar by the trampled leaves.All the wild-dances he knew, the mad dance in red raiment with the autumn, the light dance in blue sandals over the corn, the dance with white snow-wreaths in winter, and the blossom-dance through the orchards in spring.He knew where the wood-pigeons built their nests, and once when a fowler had snared the parent birds, he had brought up the young ones himself, and had built a little dovecot for them in the cleft of a pollard elm.They were quite tame, and used to feed out of his hands every morning.She would like them, and the rabbits that scurried about in the long fern, and the jays with their steely feathers and black bills, and the hedgehogs that could curl themselves up into prickly balls, and the great wise tortoises that crawled slowly about, shaking their heads and nibbling at the young leaves.Yes, she must certainly come to the forest and play with him.He would give her his own little bed, and would watch outside the window till dawn, to see that the wild horned cattle did not harm her, nor the gaunt wolves creep too near the hut.And at dawn he would tap at the shutters and wake her, and they would go out and dance together all the day long.It was really not a bit lonely in the forest.Sometimes a Bishop rode through on his white mule, reading out of a painted book.Sometimes in their green velvet caps, and their jerkins of tanned deerskin, the falconers passed by, with hooded hawks on their wrists.At vintage-time came the grape-treaders, with purple hands and feet, wreathed with glossy ivy and carrying dripping skins of wine; and the charcoal-burners sat round their huge braziers at night, watching the dry logs charring slowly in the fire, and roasting chestnuts in the ashes, and the robbers came out of their caves and made merry with them.Once, too, he had seen a beautiful procession winding up the long dusty road to Toledo.The monks went in front singing sweetly, and carrying bright banners and crosses of gold, and then, in silver armour, with matchlocks and pikes, came the soldiers, and in their midst walked three barefooted men, in strange yellow dresses painted all over with wonderful figures, and carrying lighted candles in their hands.Certainly there was a great deal to look at in the forest, and when she was tired he would find a soft bank of moss for her, or carry her in his arms, for he was very strong, though he knew that he was not tall.He would make her a necklace of red bryony berries, that would be quite as pretty as the white berries that she wore on her dress, and when she was tired of them, she could throw them away, and he would find her others.He would bring her acorn-cups and dew-drenched anemones, and tiny glow-worms to be stars in the pale gold of her hair."
"可是她这会儿在哪里呢？他问白玫瑰，白玫瑰没有理他。整个王宫静谧得仿佛沉睡了一般，甚至有些窗户连百叶窗都没拉上，却垂下了厚重的帘幕，挡住了射进屋子的光线。小矮人到处转悠，想寻到一处入口，最后他瞧见了一扇开着的小门。他溜了进去，发现自己来到了一个金碧辉煌的大厅中。大厅里处处熠熠生辉，就连地板都是用五颜六色的大石头铺成的，组成了非常规整的几何图案。比起这里，森林恐怕逊色得多了。可这儿没有小公主的影子，只有几尊雕刻精美的白色雕像。雕像从其绿宝石基座上俯视他，诡异地朝他笑，眼里却充满忧伤和茫然。","But where was she?He asked the white rose, and it made him no answer.The whole palace seemed asleep, and even where the shutters had not been closed, heavy curtains had been drawn across the windows to keep out the glare.He wandered all round looking for some place through which he might gain an entrance, and at last he caught sight of a little private door that was lying open.He slipped through, and found himself in a splendid hall, far more splendid, he feared, than the forest, there was so much more gilding everywhere, and even the floor was made of great coloured stones, fitted together into a sort of geometrical pattern.But the little Infanta was not there, only some wonderful white statues that looked down on him from their jasper pedestals, with sad blank eyes and strangely smiling lips."
"大厅的尽头垂挂着做工精致的黑天鹅绒帷幔，上面绣着太阳和星星，都是国王最中意的样式，而且用的也是他最喜爱的颜色。说不定她就躲在那后面？无论怎样，他都要去看看。","At the end of the hall hung a richly embroidered curtain of black velvet, powdered with suns and stars, the King’s favourite devices, and broidered on the colour he loved best.Perhaps she was hiding behind that?He would try at any rate."
"于是他悄悄地走过去，把帷幔拉开。空的，里面只不过是另一个房间，他认为比他刚才走过的那间更漂亮。墙上挂着一张绿挂毯，上面有很多人物。这是一幅綉制的狩猎图，是由几位佛兰芒人艺术家花了七年多时间才完成的。这里曾经是被戏称为“傻约翰国王”的房间，那个疯子国王太沉湎于狩猎了。在他精神失常的时候，他总是幻想着骑上那些后腿立起的高头大马，拖开由一群猎犬攻击的牧鹿，吹响他那打猎的号角，用他的短剑刺向那只被吓得飞奔的鹿。如今这房间被改为会议厅了。屋子中央的桌子上放着大臣们的红文件夹，上面盖着西班牙郁金香金印，以及象征哈普斯堡皇室的纹章和徽章。　","So he stole quietly across, and drew it aside.No; there was only another room, though a prettier room, he thought, than the one he had just left.The walls were hung with a many-figured green arras of needle-wrought tapestry representing a hunt, the work of some Flemish artists who had spent more than seven years in its composition.It had once been the chamber of JEAN LE FOU, as he was called, that mad King who was so enamoured of the chase, that he had often tried in his delirium to mount the huge rearing horses, and to drag down the stag on which the great hounds were leaping, sounding his hunting horn, and stabbing with his dagger at the pale flying deer.It was now used as the council-room, and on the centre table were lying the red portfolios of the ministers, stamped with the gold tulips of Spain, and with the arms and emblems of the house of Hapsburg."
"小矮人满脸惊讶地环顾四周，他真有点不敢继续往前走了。画中那些陌生而沉默的骑马人敏捷地穿梭在长长地森林中，一丁点儿声响都不发出。在他看来，画中的这些人就像烧炭夫讲过的那些可怕的幽灵——康普拉克斯，他们只在夜里外出打猎，要是狩猎途中遇上人，就会把此人变成一只雌鹿，然后去追逐。可一想到美丽的小公主，小矮人就又壮起了胆子。他希望找到小公主时她身边没有别的人，好告诉她自己也爱着她。也许她就在隔壁的那间屋子里。","The little Dwarf looked in wonder all round him, and was half-afraid to go on.The strange silent horsemen that galloped so swiftly through the long glades without making any noise, seemed to him like those terrible phantoms of whom he had heard the charcoal-burners speaking—the Comprachos, who hunt only at night, and if they meet a man, turn him into a hind, and chase him.But he thought of the pretty Infanta, and took courage.He wanted to find her alone, and to tell her that he too loved her.Perhaps she was in the room beyond."
"他从摩尔人织的柔软的地毯上跑过去，打开了门。空的！她也不在这儿。房间里空荡荡的。","He ran across the soft Moorish carpets, and opened the door.No!She was not here either.The room was quite empty."
"这是一间觐见室，用来接待外国使节。国王愿意时会亲自接见他们，不过这种事近来不常有了。许多年以前，就是在这间屋子里，英国的特使前来安排他们的女王，也就是后来成为欧洲天主教君主之一的人，与皇帝的长子联姻。屋子里挂着科尔多瓦革镀金帷幔，黑白相间的天花板下面悬挂着镀金枝形吊灯，上面可点三百支蜡烛。一张巨大的金光闪闪的华盖上用小粒珍珠绣了狮子和卡斯蒂利亚高塔图，华盖下是国王的宝座，宝座上罩着黑色天鹅绒布，上面点缀着银色的郁金香花朵，还加有精致的银白色和珍珠色的流苏。宝座第二级上面放着小公主用的跪凳，跪凳上的垫子是用银色绒布做成的，在华盖外面，跪凳下摆放着教皇使节的椅子。唯有这位使节大人才有资格在任何公开的庆典仪式上与国王坐在一起。使节那顶缠着深红帽缨的红色主教帽子就搁在前面的紫色绣框上。正对着宝座的墙上挂着一幅查理五世的画像，一副猎人打扮，跟真人一般大小。他身旁还立着一只大獒犬。另一面墙的中央挂着一幅菲利普二世的画像，栩栩如生地再现了他接受尼德兰诸省朝贡时的情景。两扇窗户中间摆着一个乌木柜，里面放着许多象牙盘子，盘子上刻着《霍尔拜因之死亡舞蹈》中的人物—据说，那些人物是这位著名的大师亲手雕刻的。","It was a throne-room, used for the reception of foreign ambassadors, when the King, which of late had not been often, consented to give them a personal audience; the same room in which, many years before, envoys had appeared from England to make arrangements for the marriage of their Queen, then one of the Catholic sovereigns of Europe, with the Emperor’s eldest son.The hangings were of gilt Cordovan leather, and a heavy gilt chandelier with branches for three hundred wax lights hung down from the black and white ceiling.Underneath a great canopy of gold cloth, on which the lions and towers of Castile were broidered in seed pearls, stood the throne itself, covered with a rich pall of black velvet studded with silver tulips and elaborately fringed with silver and pearls.On the second step of the throne was placed the kneeling-stool of the Infanta, with its cushion of cloth of silver tissue, and below that again, and beyond the limit of the canopy, stood the chair for the Papal Nuncio, who alone had the right to be seated in the King’s presence on the occasion of any public ceremonial, and whose Cardinal’s hat, with its tangled scarlet tassels, lay on a purple TABOURET in front.On the wall, facing the throne, hung a life-sized portrait of Charles V. in hunting dress, with a great mastiff by his side, and a picture of Philip II. receiving the homage of the Netherlands occupied the centre of the other wall.Between the windows stood a black ebony cabinet, inlaid with plates of ivory, on which the figures from Holbein’s Dance of Death had been graved—by the hand, some said, of that famous master himself."
"可是小矮人没有心思留意眼前的胜景。他不愿意用手头上的玫瑰花交换华盖上的珍珠，也不愿意用哪怕一片白玫瑰花瓣交换宝座。他只想在小公主去看台之前见她一面，并邀请她在他的舞蹈结束之后就跟他一起离开。这时候王宫里的空气沉闷而压抑。然而在森林里，风儿自由自在地吹着，树叶随风摇曳，阳光透过树叶的缝隙照射过来，仿佛给它们镀上了一层金。森林中也有鲜花，虽然可能不及花园里的花那么娇艳，但更加芳香迷人。早春时，清凉的幽谷中、草色青青的小山上开遍了风信子，漫山遍野变成了花的海洋，紫色的花浪此起彼伏。一簇簇黄色的迎春花爬满了橡树树根，还有色彩鲜艳的白屈菜，以及随处可见的蓝色婆婆纳，淡紫色和金黄色的丁香。榛树上挂着灰色的的柔荑花絮，毛地黄垂下那带斑纹的花粉囊，这是蜜蜂们常来光顾的地方。栗树枝头冒出的幼芽如白色的星子，山楂树开的花透着有如苍白月色般的凄美。是的，只要他能够找着她，她一定愿意去的！她会跟他一起到欢乐无穷的森林中去的。在那里他会整天为她跳舞，逗她开心。想到这儿，他的眼中露出了笑意，随即他走进了另一个房间。","But the little Dwarf cared nothing for all this magnificence.He would not have given his rose for all the pearls on the canopy, nor one white petal of his rose for the throne itself.What he wanted was to see the Infanta before she went down to the pavilion, and to ask her to come away with him when he had finished his dance.Here, in the Palace, the air was close and heavy, but in the forest the wind blew free, and the sunlight with wandering hands of gold moved the tremulous leaves aside.There were flowers, too, in the forest, not so splendid, perhaps, as the flowers in the garden, but more sweetly scented for all that; hyacinths in early spring that flooded with waving purple the cool glens, and grassy knolls; yellow primroses that nestled in little clumps round the gnarled roots of the oak-trees; bright celandine, and blue speedwell, and irises lilac and gold.There were grey catkins on the hazels, and the foxgloves drooped with the weight of their dappled bee-haunted cells.The chestnut had its spires of white stars, and the hawthorn its pallid moons of beauty.Yes: surely she would come if he could only find her!She would come with him to the fair forest, and all day long he would dance for her delight.A smile lit up his eyes at the thought, and he passed into the next room."
"这一间是所有房间中最明亮、最漂亮的。屋里的墙壁上布满了绣着粉色花朵的卢卡锦缎，缎子上面绘着小鸟的图案，还点缀着美丽的银色花朵。家具是用大块的银子做的，精心装饰着绚丽的花环和栩栩如生的小爱神。两个大壁炉的前面是一个大屏风，上面绣着鹦鹉和孔雀，海蓝色的缟玛瑙地板给人一种绵延不断的错觉。这里不止他一个人。房间的另一头，门道的阴影下，有一个小小的人影，正朝他望着。他的心一颤，口中迸发出一声喜悦的叫声，随即他一下子跑到了阳光下。他这么做的时候，那个人影也跟着这么做，他显然是看出来了。","Of all the rooms this was the brightest and the most beautiful.The walls were covered with a pink-flowered Lucca damask, patterned with birds and dotted with dainty blossoms of silver; the furniture was of massive silver, festooned with florid wreaths, and swinging Cupids; in front of the two large fire-places stood great screens broidered with parrots and peacocks, and the floor, which was of sea-green onyx, seemed to stretch far away into the distance.Nor was he alone.Standing under the shadow of the doorway, at the extreme end of the room, he saw a little figure watching him.His heart trembled, a cry of joy broke from his lips, and he moved out into the sunlight.As he did so, the figure moved out also, and he saw it plainly."
"小公主！不，那是个怪物，是他所见过的最难看的怪物。全然不像其他人长的那样子，那影子奇形怪状的：驼着背，瘸着腿，一个大脑袋摇来晃去，一头黑发像鬃毛。小矮人皱了皱眉，怪物也皱了皱眉。小矮人笑，怪物也跟着笑，而且还把两只手叉在腰间，跟小矮人一个样。小矮人嘲弄地向怪物鞠了一躬，怪物也给小矮人还了一个礼。小矮人朝怪物走去，怪物也迈着同样的步子走上前去迎接小矮人；当小矮人停下来时，怪物也停下来。小矮人兴奋地叫了起来，跑上前去，伸出一只手；而怪物的手也朝小矮人的手伸了过来，那只手冷冰冰的。突然小矮人觉得好害怕，又把手挥过去；怪物的手也很快地伸了过来。小矮人试着再靠近一点儿，但有什么光滑而坚硬的东西挡住了他。怪物的脸此时正好贴近小矮人的脸，一脸恐惧的样子。小矮人把头发从眼睛上拂去。怪物也模仿他。小矮人伸手去打怪物，怪物也回以拳头。小矮人朝怪物摆出讨厌它的样子，怪物也朝小矮人扮鬼脸。小矮人往后退，怪物也跟着往后退。","The Infanta!It was a monster, the most grotesque monster he had ever beheld.Not properly shaped, as all other people were, but hunchbacked, and crooked-limbed, with huge lolling head and mane of black hair.The little Dwarf frowned, and the monster frowned also.He laughed, and it laughed with him, and held its hands to its sides, just as he himself was doing.He made it a mocking bow, and it returned him a low reverence.He went towards it, and it came to meet him, copying each step that he made, and stopping when he stopped himself.He shouted with amusement, and ran forward, and reached out his hand, and the hand of the monster touched his, and it was as cold as ice.He grew afraid, and moved his hand across, and the monster’s hand followed it quickly.He tried to press on, but something smooth and hard stopped him.The face of the monster was now close to his own, and seemed full of terror.He brushed his hair off his eyes.It imitated him.He struck at it, and it returned blow for blow.He loathed it, and it made hideous faces at him.He drew back, and it retreated."
"这是什么东西呢？小矮人想了一会儿， 然后环顾四周。真是怪了，这间屋子里就像是有面隐形的墙，墙内都是清澈的水，不管什么东西都有倒影。是的，墙上有跟屋里一模一样的图像和长椅。门口壁龛里躺着熟睡的农牧神，竟也有一个一模一样的孪生兄弟酣睡在那里；伫立在阳光下的银像维纳斯也正朝着另一个一样美丽的维纳斯伸出双臂。","What is it?He thought for a moment, and looked round at the rest of the room.It was strange, but everything seemed to have its double in this invisible wall of clear water.Yes, picture for picture was repeated, and couch for couch.The sleeping Faun that lay in the alcove by the doorway had its twin brother that slumbered, and the silver Venus that stood in the sunlight held out her arms to a Venus as lovely as herself."
"这难道就是女神厄科吗？他曾经在山谷里大声呼喊她，她也是一个字一个字地回应着。厄科能模仿听到的东西，难道她也能模仿看到的东西吗？难道她能模拟出一个与真实世界一样的虚拟世界？难道物体的影子也有颜色和生命，也可以动吗？莫非这就是——？","Was it Echo?He had called to her once in the valley, and she had answered him word for word.Could she mock the eye, as she mocked the voice?Could she make a mimic world just like the real world?Could the shadows of things have colour and life and movement?Could it be that—?"
"小矮人大吃一惊，赶紧从怀里拿出那朵美丽的白玫瑰，转过身，亲吻鲜花。怪物同样也有一朵白玫瑰，花瓣竟与小矮人的一模一样！它也在亲吻鲜花，动作跟小矮人的如出一辙，还把花按在胸口上，这动作看起来很可怕。","He started, and taking from his breast the beautiful white rose, he turned round, and kissed it.The monster had a rose of its own, petal for petal the same!It kissed it with like kisses, and pressed it to its heart with horrible gestures."
"等小矮人明白了其中的蹊跷时，他绝望地狂叫起来，趴在地上，痛苦地抽噎着。原来那个无比丑陋、弯腰驼背的怪物不是别人，正是他自己。那个怪物就是他，所有小孩嘲笑的是他，那位他原以为爱他的小公主——她也只是嘲笑他的丑相和瘸腿。为什么他们要把他带出森林？森林里可没有镜子告诉他自己是多么的丑陋啊。为什么他的父亲没有杀死他，而是把他卖了，让他出尽洋相？热泪从小矮人的脸颊上滴落下来，他把白玫瑰扯了个粉碎。那个趴在地上的怪物也学他的样子，把花瓣撒向空中。它匍匐在地上；他朝它看了看，它也一脸痛苦地望着他。他朝一边爬去，不愿再看见它，并用双手捂住自己的眼睛。他像一只受了伤的动物，爬到阴暗处，躺在那儿呻吟。","When the truth dawned upon him, he gave a wild cry of despair, and fell sobbing to the ground.So it was he who was misshapen and hunchbacked, foul to look at and grotesque.He himself was the monster, and it was at him that all the children had been laughing, and the little Princess who he had thought loved him—she too had been merely mocking at his ugliness, and making merry over his twisted limbs.Why had they not left him in the forest, where there was no mirror to tell him how loathsome he was?Why had his father not killed him, rather than sell him to his shame?The hot tears poured down his cheeks, and he tore the white rose to pieces.The sprawling monster did the same, and scattered the faint petals in the air.It grovelled on the ground, and, when he looked at it, it watched him with a face drawn with pain.He crept away, lest he should see it, and covered his eyes with his hands.He crawled, like some wounded thing, into the shadow, and lay there moaning."
"正在这时，小公主带着她的小伙伴们从敞开的窗子爬了进来，他们见难看的小矮人躺在地上，紧握着拳头捶打地板，他们都忍不住被他那极其滑稽夸张的动作逗得哈哈大笑，还围着他看热闹。","And at that moment the Infanta herself came in with her companions through the open window, and when they saw the ugly little dwarf lying on the ground and beating the floor with his clenched hands, in the most fantastic and exaggerated manner, they went off into shouts of happy laughter, and stood all round him and watched him."
"“他的舞蹈很有趣，”小公主说，“可他的表演更好玩。他实在是跟木偶人一样棒，只是不那么自然。”说完，她摇起大扇子，高兴地拍手叫好。","“His dancing was funny,” said the Infanta; “but his acting is funnier still.Indeed he is almost as good as the puppets, only of course not quite so natural.”And she fluttered her big fan, and applauded."
"可是小矮人再也没有抬起头来，他的啜泣声越来越微弱。突然，他发出一声奇怪的喘息声，并在身边抓起来。随后他又倒了下去，躺在地上一动不动。","But the little Dwarf never looked up, and his sobs grew fainter and fainter, and suddenly he gave a curious gasp, and clutched his side.And then he fell back again, and lay quite still."
"“这可真精彩。”过了一会儿，小公主又开口了，“不过现在你必须为我跳舞了。”“是呀，”所有的孩子都叫起来，“你得站起来跳舞，你跟叟猴一样聪明，不过你比它们更好玩。”可是小矮人没有理会他们。","“That is capital,” said the Infanta, after a pause; “but now you must dance for me.” “Yes,” cried all the children, “you must get up and dance, for you are as clever as the Barbary apes, and much more ridiculous.”But the little Dwarf made no answer."
"小公主跺了跺脚，大声喊她的叔叔。她叔叔正和宫廷大臣一起在阳台上散步，读着刚从墨西哥送来的急件。墨西哥最近建立了宗教法庭。“我的这个滑稽的小矮人生气了，”她大声嚷道，“你一定要把他叫醒，让他为我跳舞。”他们两人相视而笑，从容地走了过去。唐佩德罗弯下腰，用他的刺绣手套拍打小矮人的脸。“你必须跳舞”，他命令道，“小怪物。你必须得跳。西班牙及印度群岛的小公主要开心快乐才对。”可是小矮人一动不动。","And the Infanta stamped her foot, and called out to her uncle, who was walking on the terrace with the Chamberlain, reading some despatches that had just arrived from Mexico, where the Holy Office had recently been established.“My funny little dwarf is sulking,” she cried, “you must wake him up, and tell him to dance for me.” They smiled at each other, and sauntered in, and Don Pedro stooped down, and slapped the Dwarf on the cheek with his embroidered glove.“You must dance,” he said, “PETIT MONSIRE.You must dance.The Infanta of Spain and the Indies wishes to be amused.” But the little Dwarf never moved."
"“应该叫个执鞭人来。”唐佩德罗不耐烦地说，然后他又回到了阳台上。宫廷大臣却是一副凝重的神情，他跪在小矮人的身旁，把手按在小矮人的胸口上。过了一会儿，他耸耸肩，站起身来，向小公主深深鞠了一躬，开口说道——“我美丽的小公主，您的这位滑稽的小矮人永远都不会再跳舞了。可惜啊，说不准他这么丑陋的长相能逗得国王开心呢。”“可是他为什么不再跳舞了呢？”小公主笑着问。","“A whipping master should be sent for,” said Don Pedro wearily, and he went back to the terrace.But the Chamberlain looked grave, and he knelt beside the little dwarf, and put his hand upon his heart.And after a few moments he shrugged his shoulders, and rose up, and having made a low bow to the Infanta, he said—“MI BELLA PRINCESA, your funny little dwarf will never dance again.It is a pity, for he is so ugly that he might have made the King smile.” “But why will he not dance again?” asked the Infanta, laughing."
"“因为他的心碎了。”大臣说。","“Because his heart is broken,” answered the Chamberlain."
"公主把眉头一皱，十分不满地撅起她那玫瑰叶般的可爱嘴唇。“那以后让那些来陪我玩的人都不要带心啦。”她大声说，然后朝花园里跑去了。","And the Infanta frowned, and her dainty rose-leaf lips curled in pretty disdain.“For the future let those who come to play with me have no hearts,” she cried, and she ran out into the garden.  "
"渔夫和他的灵魂","The Fisherman and His Soul"
"每天晚上年轻的渔夫都出海，把渔网撒到水里。","Every evening the young Fisherman went out upon the sea, and threw his nets into the water."
"吹陆风的时候，渔夫什么也捕不到，或者充其量也就一点点。这种风长着一对黑翅膀，来势凶猛，卷起一阵阵巨浪。不过吹海风时，鱼便从深海浮上来，成群地游到他的网里。他便把捕来的鱼拿到集市上卖掉。","When the wind blew from the land he caught nothing, or but little at best, for it was a bitter and black-winged wind, and rough waves rose up to meet it.But when the wind blew to the shore, the fish came in from the deep, and swam into the meshes of his nets, and he took them to the market-place and sold them."
"每天晚上他都出海打渔。有一天晚上渔网太沉，他差点儿没能把网给拖上船来。他笑了，自言自语道：“想必是所有游来游去的鱼都跑到我的网里面了，要不就是某个在人们看来是珍禽异兽的迟钝怪物中了我的圈套，再不就是捉到了伟大女王喜欢的某种可怕的东西。”他使出浑身解数，紧紧地拉着那跟粗绳子，手臂上凸起的青筋就像是漆在青铜花瓶上的蓝色彩釉条纹一样。他又使劲地拽那根细绳，近了，近了，扁平的软木浮圈越来越近了，终于，网浮出了水面。","Every evening he went out upon the sea, and one evening the net was so heavy that hardly could he draw it into the boat.And he laughed, and said to himself, “Surely I have caught all the fish that swim, or snared some dull monster that will be a marvel to men, or some thing of horror that the great Queen will desire,” and putting forth all his strength, he tugged at the coarse ropes till, like lines of blue enamel round a vase of bronze, the long veins rose up on his arms.He tugged at the thin ropes, and nearer and nearer came the circle of flat corks, and the net rose at last to the top of the water."
"然而，里面没有一条鱼，也没有什么怪物或任何可怕的东西，网里面只躺着一个熟睡的小美人鱼。","But no fish at all was in it, nor any monster or thing of horror, but only a little Mermaid lying fast asleep."
"她的金发湿漉漉的，卷曲得有如羊毛，每一根头发都如同放在玻璃杯中的细金线。她的身体跟象牙一般白，她的尾巴是银色和珍珠色的。在她那银色和珍珠色的尾巴上面缠绕着翠绿的海草；她的耳朵像贝壳，嘴唇像珊瑚。冰冷的海浪冲击着她冰冷的胸脯，海盐在她的眼皮上闪闪发光。","Her hair was as a wet fleece of gold, and each separate hair as a thread of fine gold in a cup of glass.Her body was as white ivory, and her tail was of silver and pearl.Silver and pearl was her tail, and the green weeds of the sea coiled round it; and like sea-shells were her ears, and her lips were like sea-coral.The cold waves dashed over her cold breasts, and the salt glistened upon her eyelids."
"她多美啊，年轻的渔夫一见到她就惊叹不已。他伸手把渔网拉到自己的身边，俯下身紧紧地把她搂在怀中。他碰到她时，她像一只受惊的海鸥一样大叫了一声，醒了过来，用紫水晶般的眼睛惊恐地望着他，挣扎着想逃走。可他紧紧地抱着她，不甘心就这么放她走。","So beautiful was she that when the young Fisherman saw her he was filled with wonder, and he put out his hand and drew the net close to him, and leaning over the side he clasped her in his arms.And when he touched her, she gave a cry like a startled sea-gull, and woke, and looked at him in terror with her mauve-amethyst eyes, and struggled that she might escape.But he held her tightly to him, and would not suffer her to depart."
"当小美人鱼意识到自己无法逃脱时，便开始哭了起来，说道：“我求求你放了我吧，我是国王的独生女。我的父亲上了年纪，孤苦无依。”　年轻的渔夫却回答说：“除非你答应我一个条件，我才肯放你走。不论我什么时候呼唤你，你都要来为我唱歌。因为鱼儿都喜欢你们美人鱼家族的歌声，那样我的网就总会装得满满的了。”“要是我答应了你，你真的会放我走吗？”美人鱼哭着问。","And when she saw that she could in no way escape from him, she began to weep, and said, “I pray thee let me go, for I am the only daughter of a King, and my father is aged and alone.” But the young Fisherman answered, “I will not let thee go save thou makest me a promise that whenever I call thee, thou wilt come and sing to me, for the fish delight to listen to the song of the Sea-folk, and so shall my nets be full.” “Wilt thou in very truth let me go, if I promise thee this?” cried the Mermaid."
"“我一定会放你走。”年轻的渔夫回答说。","“In very truth I will let thee go,” said the young Fisherman."
"于是小美人鱼依他所希望的那样许诺，并以美人鱼家族的名义起誓。年轻的渔夫便松开了胳膊。美人鱼带着莫名的恐惧摇摆着尾巴，沉入海里去了。","So she made him the promise he desired, and sware it by the oath of the Sea-folk.And he loosened his arms from about her, and she sank down into the water, trembling with a strange fear."
"每天晚上只要年轻的渔夫外出打渔，都会呼唤美人鱼。而美人鱼也会游到海面，为他歌唱。一听到她的声音，海豚便在她的周围游来游去，野海鸥也在她头顶上空盘旋。","Every evening the young Fisherman went out upon the sea, and called to the Mermaid, and she rose out of the water and sang to him.Round and round her swam the dolphins, and the wild gulls wheeled above her head."
"她的歌声曼妙无比。她唱的是美人鱼家族的故事。他们赶着牲口从一个洞走到另一个洞，肩上还扛着幼崽。她唱到了海神特赖登们，他们留着绿色的长胡须，胸膛毛茸茸的，每当国王路过时，他们就吹响带螺纹的海螺。她唱到了清一色用琥珀建成的国王宫殿。屋顶镶嵌着光洁的绿宝石，路上铺着闪光的珍珠。她唱到了海底花园，在那里，精美的珊瑚大扇整天都在摇摆着，鱼儿像银鸟似的穿梭而过，海葵攀附在岩石上，粉红色的萌芽从拱起的黄沙中冒了出来。她唱到了来自北方海域的大鲸鱼，它们的鳍上挂着尖尖的冰柱。她唱到了会讲故事的塞壬，塞壬的故事实在太魅惑人了，过往的商人们不得不用蜡来密封他们的耳朵，以免听到故事而跳入大海丢了性命。她还唱到有着高高桅杆的沉船，冻僵的水手们紧抱帆缆；鲭鱼穿过开着的舱门游进游出。她唱到了小藤壶，它们都是伟大的旅行家，附着在船的龙骨上，环游全世界。她唱到了住在悬崖边的乌贼，只要它们愿意，它们能伸出长长的黑手臂，遮天蔽日。她唱到了鹦鹉螺。鹦鹉螺自己拥有一艘蛋白石雕刻的船，由一张丝绸帆驾驶着。她唱到快乐的雄性美人鱼，他们弹着竖琴，能把北海巨妖陶醉得昏昏入睡。她唱到孩子们，他们抓住光溜溜的海豚，大笑着骑在它们的背上。她唱到美人鱼，她们躺在洁白的浪花中，向水手们伸出双臂。她唱到了长着弯曲长牙的海狮，以及鬃毛飘飘的海马。","And she sang a marvellous song.For she sang of the Sea-folk who drive their flocks from cave to cave, and carry the little calves on their shoulders; of the Tritons who have long green beards, and hairy breasts, and blow through twisted conchs when the King passes by; of the palace of the King which is all of amber, with a roof of clear emerald, and a pavement of bright pearl; and of the gardens of the sea where the great filigrane fans of coral wave all day long, and the fish dart about like silver birds, and the anemones cling to the rocks, and the pinks bourgeon in the ribbed yellow sand.She sang of the big whales that come down from the north seas and have sharp icicles hanging to their fins; of the Sirens who tell of such wonderful things that the merchants have to stop their ears with wax lest they should hear them, and leap into the water and be drowned;of the sunken galleys with their tall masts, and the frozen sailors clinging to the rigging, and the mackerel swimming in and out of the open portholes;of the little barnacles who are great travellers, and cling to the keels of the ships and go round and round the world; and of the cuttlefish who live in the sides of the cliffs and stretch out their long black arms, and can make night come when they will it.She sang of the nautilus who has a boat of her own that is carved out of an opal and steered with a silken sail; of the happy Mermen who play upon harps and can charm the great Kraken to sleep; of the little children who catch hold of the slippery porpoises and ride laughing upon their backs; of the Mermaids who lie in the white foam and hold out their arms to the mariners; and of the sea-lions with their curved tusks, and the sea-horses with their floating manes."
"她唱的时候，不计其数的金枪鱼都从海底游上来聆听她的歌声，这时年轻的渔夫趁机在它们四周撒下网，将它们一网打尽，还用鱼叉叉起网外的鱼。等他的船装满后，美人鱼朝他笑笑，便沉入海底。","And as she sang, all the tunny-fish came in from the deep to listen to her, and the young Fisherman threw his nets round them and caught them, and others he took with a spear.And when his boat was well-laden, the Mermaid would sink down into the sea, smiling at him."
"不过她从不愿靠近他，生怕又给他捉住了。年轻的渔夫常常呼唤小美人鱼，恳求她，可她就是不愿意。当他试图抓住她时，她便像一头海豹似的，敏捷地窜入水里，而且那一整天都不再露面。日复一日，她的歌声越来越吸引他了。她唱得那么悦耳动听，渔夫常常听得忘了渔网和手中的活计，连自己的本行都不管不顾了。长着朱红色鳍和凸出金眼的金枪鱼成群地游过来，可他没有心思留意它们。他的鱼叉放在一边不用了，柳条编织的篮子也是空空的。他张着嘴巴，神情黯然，眼里充满疑惑。他呆呆地坐在船上聆听着，一直听到茫茫海雾笼罩在他的四周，而月亮游荡在夜空，银白的月光撒在他那晒黑的四肢上。","Yet would she never come near him that he might touch her.Oftentimes he called to her and prayed of her, but she would not; and when he sought to seize her she dived into the water as a seal might dive, nor did he see her again that day.And each day the sound of her voice became sweeter to his ears.So sweet was her voice that he forgot his nets and his cunning, and had no care of his craft.Vermilion-finned and with eyes of bossy gold, the tunnies went by in shoals, but he heeded them not.His spear lay by his side unused, and his baskets of plaited osier were empty.With lips parted, and eyes dim with wonder, he sat idle in his boat and listened, listening till the sea-mists crept round him, and the wandering moon stained his brown limbs with silver."
"一天晚上，渔夫把美人鱼唤来，对她说：“小美人鱼，小美人鱼，我爱你。让我做你的新郎吧，因为我爱你。”可是美人鱼摇摇头。“你有人的灵魂，”她回答说，“只要你肯打发走你的灵魂，我才可能爱上你。”于是年轻的渔夫自言自语道：“我的灵魂对我有什么用呢？我看不见它。我触摸不到它。我更不了解它。我一定要把它打发走，那样我就会变得开心多了。”想到这里，他开心地叫出声来，并从漆过的船上站了起来，朝美人鱼伸出双臂。“我会把我的灵魂打发走的，”他大声说，“到时你是我的新娘，我是你的新郎。我们一起生活在大海深处。凡是你歌里唱过的地方，你都领我去看一看；凡是你希望我做的，我都尽力去做。我们生活在一起，永永远远都不分离。”小美人鱼幸福地笑了，羞赧地双手掩面。","And one evening he called to her, and said: “Little Mermaid, little Mermaid, I love thee.Take me for thy bridegroom, for I love thee.” But the Mermaid shook her head.“Thou hast a human soul,” she answered.“If only thou wouldst send away thy soul, then could I love thee.” And the young Fisherman said to himself, “Of what use is my soul to me?I cannot see it.I may not touch it.I do not know it.Surely I will send it away from me, and much gladness shall be mine.”And a cry of joy broke from his lips, and standing up in the painted boat, he held out his arms to the Mermaid.“I will send my soul away,” he cried, “and you shall be my bride, and I will be thy bridegroom, and in the depth of the sea we will dwell together, and all that thou hast sung of thou shalt show me, and all that thou desirest I will do, nor shall our lives be divided.” And the little Mermaid laughed for pleasure and hid her face in her hands."
"“可是我如何才能把我的灵魂打发走呢？”年轻的渔夫大声问，“告诉我该怎么做，瞧！我一定会照办的。”","“But how shall I send my soul from me?” cried the young Fisherman.“Tell me how I may do it, and lo! it shall be done.” "
"“哎呀！我也不知道，”小美人说，“我们美人鱼家族是没有灵魂的。”说完，美人鱼依依不舍地望了渔夫一眼，就沉到海底去了。","“Alas! I know not,” said the little Mermaid: “the Sea-folk have no souls.”And she sank down into the deep, looking wistfully at him."
"第二天一大早，太阳从山顶上升起还不到一拃高的时候，年轻的渔夫就来到神父家，连敲了三下门。","Now early on the next morning, before the sun was the span of a man’s hand above the hill, the young Fisherman went to the house of the Priest and knocked three times at the door."
"见习修士透过大门上的小窗口朝外面望去，看清来人后便拉下门闩，说：“请进。”年轻的渔夫走了进去，跪在地板上散发着芳香的灯芯草垫上，叫了一声正在大声读《圣经》的神父，对他说：“神父，我爱上了一位美人鱼，可我的灵魂阻碍了我，使我不能实现自己的愿望。请告诉我，我怎样才能把灵魂打发走，因为我确实不需要它。我的灵魂对我有什么用呢？我看不见它。我触摸不到它。我更不了解它。”神父捶着自己的胸膛答道：“唉，唉，你是疯了还是吃了什么毒草。灵魂是人身上最高贵的部分，是上帝赐给我们的，我们应该高尚地对待它。世上没有比人的灵魂更珍贵的东西，地球上的万物都无法与之媲美。它的价值抵得上世上所有的金子，而且比国王们的红宝石还要值钱得多。因此，我的孩子，不要再有这种念头了，因为这是一宗不可饶恕的罪过。至于美人鱼家族，它们都是道德败坏的。谁要是与它们来往，也会道德败坏。它们跟地上的牲畜一样善恶不分，耶稣基督不是为它们而死的。”听完神父这番严厉的劝诫后，年轻的渔夫双眼噙满泪水。他站起身对神父说：“神父，农牧神居住在森林里，过得很快乐；雄美人鱼坐在岩石上，弹着金红色竖琴。他们的日子有如花儿般五彩缤纷，让我也像他们那样吧，我求您了。至于我的灵魂，如果它拦在我和我所爱的东西之间的话，它对我还有什么好处呢？”“肉体的爱是邪恶的。”神父皱着眉大声说道，“异教的东西都是邪恶的、罪恶的，是上帝不乐意在他的王国里见到的。林中的农牧神应该受到诅咒，海洋中的歌唱者也应该受到诅咒！我在夜里听到过他们的歌声，他们企图引诱我离开我的念珠。他们敲我的窗户，还对我笑。他们悄声对我讲那些他们引以为乐的邪恶故事。他们用种种诱惑引诱我。我祷告时，他们朝我扮鬼脸。他们是没救了。我告诉你，他们没救了。他们心中既没有天堂，也没有地狱，他们更不会颂扬上帝的名字。”“神父，”年轻的渔夫大叫着说，“您不知道自己在说什么吧。有一次我用渔网捕到了大海国王的女儿。她比晨星还要美丽，比月亮还要洁白。我愿意用我的灵魂换取她的身体，我愿意舍弃天堂赢得她的爱情。请答复我的请求，好让我平静地离开吧。”“走吧！走吧！”神父叫喊起来，“你爱的人堕落了，你也会跟她一起堕落的。”神父没有祝福渔夫，就把他赶出了门。","The novice looked out through the wicket, and when he saw who it was, he drew back the latch and said to him, “Enter.” And the young Fisherman passed in, and knelt down on the sweet-smelling rushes of the floor, and cried to the Priest who was reading out of the Holy Book and said to him, “Father, I am in love with one of the Sea-folk, and my soul hindereth me from having my desire.Tell me how I can send my soul away from me, for in truth I have no need of it.Of what value is my soul to me?I cannot see it.I may not touch it.I do not know it.” And the Priest beat his breast, and answered, “Alack, alack, thou art mad, or hast eaten of some poisonous herb, for the soul is the noblest part of man, and was given to us by God that we should nobly use it.There is no thing more precious than a human soul, nor any earthly thing that can be weighed with it.It is worth all the gold that is in the world, and is more precious than the rubies of the kings.Therefore, my son, think not any more of this matter, for it is a sin that may not be forgiven.And as for the Sea-folk, they are lost, and they who would traffic with them are lost also.They are as the beasts of the field that know not good from evil, and for them the Lord has not died.” The young Fisherman’s eyes filled with tears when he heard the bitter words of the Priest, and he rose up from his knees and said to him, “Father, the Fauns live in the forest and are glad, and on the rocks sit the Mermen with their harps of red gold.Let me be as they are, I beseech thee, for their days are as the days of flowers.And as for my soul, what doth my soul profit me, if it stand between me and the thing that I love?” “The love of the body is vile,” cried the Priest, knitting his brows, “and vile and evil are the pagan things God suffers to wander through His world.Accursed be the Fauns of the woodland, and accursed be the singers of the sea!I have heard them at night-time, and they have sought to lure me from my beads.They tap at the window, and laugh.They whisper into my ears the tale of their perilous joys.They tempt me with temptations, and when I would pray they make mouths at me.They are lost, I tell thee, they are lost.For them there is no heaven nor hell, and in neither shall they praise God’s name.” “Father,” cried the young Fisherman, “thou knowest not what thou sayest.Once in my net I snared the daughter of a King.She is fairer than the morning star, and whiter than the moon.For her body I would give my soul, and for her love I would surrender heaven.Tell me what I ask of thee, and let me go in peace.” “Away! Away!” cried the Priest: “thy leman is lost, and thou shalt be lost with her.” And he gave him no blessing, but drove him from his door."
"于是年轻的渔夫来到集市上。他耷拉着头，慢慢地走着，一副愁眉苦脸的样子。","And the young Fisherman went down into the market-place, and he walked slowly, and with bowed head, as one who is in sorrow."
"见他走过来，商人们便开始窃窃私语，其中一个人朝他走去，喊他的名字，对他说：“你要卖什么东西吗？”“我想把我的灵魂卖给你们。”渔夫回答说。“我祈求你们把它从我身上买走吧，因为我已经对它厌倦了。我的灵魂对我有什么用呢？我看不见它。我触摸不到它。我更不了解它。”可是商人们讥笑他说：“你的灵魂对我们又有什么用呢？它连半块破银币都不值。把你的身体卖给我们当奴隶吧，我们会为你穿上海紫色的衣服，给你戴一枚戒指，把你变成伟大女王的宠臣。别管什么灵魂了。对我们来说，它既不值钱，又不能替我们做事。”年轻的渔夫自言自语道：“灵魂这东西多么奇怪啊！神父对我说灵魂的价值抵得上全世界的金子，可商人却说连半块破银币都不值。”他离开了市场，来到海边，开始思索接下来自己该怎么办。","And when the merchants saw him coming, they began to whisper to each other, and one of them came forth to meet him, and called him by name, and said to him, “What hast thou to sell?” “I will sell thee my soul,” he answered.“I pray thee buy it of me, for I am weary of it.Of what use is my soul to me?I cannot see it.I may not touch it.I do not know it.” But the merchants mocked at him, and said, “Of what use is a man’s soul to us?It is not worth a clipped piece of silver.Sell us thy body for a slave, and we will clothe thee in sea-purple, and put a ring upon thy finger, and make thee the minion of the great Queen.But talk not of the soul, for to us it is nought, nor has it any value for our service.” And the young Fisherman said to himself: “How strange a thing this is!The Priest telleth me that the soul is worth all the gold in the world, and the merchants say that it is not worth a clipped piece of silver.”And he passed out of the market-place, and went down to the shore of the sea, and began to ponder on what he should do."
"正午，渔夫想起了自己的一个伙伴，是个收购圣彼得草的商人。他曾经跟渔夫讲过一个年轻的女巫，她住在海湾入口处的一个洞穴里，巫术非常了不起。于是他便冲了出去，在海岸上一路狂奔，身后尘土飞扬。他太迫切地想要把自己的灵魂打发走了。年轻的女巫手掌发痒，便知道他即将到来。她笑了，披散开她的一头红发。她披头散发地站在洞口，手中拿着一枝盛开的野生铁杉。","And at noon he remembered how one of his companions, who was a gatherer of samphire, had told him of a certain young Witch who dwelt in a cave at the head of the bay and was very cunning in her witcheries.And he set to and ran, so eager was he to get rid of his soul, and a cloud of dust followed him as he sped round the sand of the shore.By the itching of her palm the young Witch knew his coming, and she laughed and let down her red hair.With her red hair falling around her, she stood at the opening of the cave, and in her hand she had a spray of wild hemlock that was blossoming."
"“你缺少什么呢？你缺少什么呢？”她大声问道，此时渔夫正气喘吁吁地爬上悬崖，向她弯腰行礼。“是在风向不好的时候，让鱼都游到你的渔网里吗？我有一根用芦苇做的小口哨，只要我一吹响它，鲻鱼便会游到海湾里来。不过这得付出代价，漂亮的小伙子，这是要付出代价的。你缺少什么呢？你缺少什么呢？是要一场风暴把船摧毁，把满载珍宝的箱子冲到岸上来吗？我所施的风暴的威力远胜过狂风，因为我所效劳的那人比狂风更凶猛。我只用一个筛子和一桶水就能把大船倾覆在海底。不过这是要付出代价的。漂亮的小伙子，这是要付出代价的。你缺少什么呢？你缺少什么呢？我知道一种生长在山谷中的花，除了我无人知道它。它长着紫色的叶子，星形的花心，花汁白得像牛奶。你只要用这种花去碰一下王后坚定的嘴唇，她就会跟着你走遍海角天涯。她会从国王的床榻上起来，跟着你走遍整个世界。不过这是要付出代价的。漂亮的小伙子，这是要付出代价的。你需要什么呢？你缺少什么呢？我可以在研钵中捣碎蟾蜍，并用捣好的东西做成肉汤，还用一只死人的手去搅拌它。在你的仇人熟睡时，把汤洒在他身上，他就会变成一条黑色的毒蛇，被他的亲身母亲杀死。我可以只用一个轮子就把月亮从空中拉下来，我还可以让你透过水晶球看见死亡。你缺少什么呢？　你缺少什么呢？告诉我你的愿望，我将会满足你，但是要付出代价的，漂亮的小伙子，你得付出代价。”“我要求的不过是件很小的事情，”年轻的渔夫说，“可是神父因为这个生我的气，还把我给赶出来了。那不过是件小事，可商人们也讥笑我，拒绝了我。因此我才跑到你这儿来。虽然人们都说你邪恶，但是不论你要我付出什么代价，我都愿意。”“你到底想要什么？”女巫来到他面前问道。","“What d’ye lack?What d’ye lack?” she cried, as he came panting up the steep, and bent down before her.“Fish for thy net, when the wind is foul?I have a little reed-pipe, and when I blow on it the mullet come sailing into the bay.But it has a price, pretty boy, it has a price.What  d’ye lack?What  d’ye lack?A storm to wreck the ships, and wash the chests of rich treasure ashore?I have more storms than the wind has, for I serve one who is stronger than the wind, and with a sieve and a pail of water I can send the great galleys to the bottom of the sea.But I have a price, pretty boy, I have a price.What  d’ye lack?What  d’ye lack?I know a flower that grows in the valley, none knows it but I.It has purple leaves, and a star in its heart, and its juice is as white as milk.Shouldst thou touch with this flower the hard lips of the Queen, she would follow thee all over the world.Out of the bed of the King she would rise, and over the whole world she would follow thee.And it has a price, pretty boy, it has a price.What  d’ye lack?What  d’ye lack?I can pound a toad in a mortar, and make broth of it, and stir the broth with a dead man’s hand.Sprinkle it on thine enemy while he sleeps, and he will turn into a black viper, and his own mother will slay him.With a wheel I can draw the Moon from heaven, and in a crystal I can show thee Death.What  d’ye lack?What  d’ye lack?Tell me thy desire, and I will give it thee, and thou shalt pay me a price, pretty boy, thou shalt pay me a price.” “My desire is but for a little thing,” said the young Fisherman, “yet hath the Priest been wroth with me, and driven me forth.It is but for a little thing, and the merchants have mocked at me, and denied me.Therefore am I come to thee, though men call thee evil, and whatever be thy price I shall pay it.” “What wouldst thou?” asked the Witch, coming near to him."
"“我要把我的灵魂打发走。”年轻的渔夫回答道。","“I would send my soul away from me,” answered the young Fisherman."
"女巫吓得脸色苍白，浑身颤抖起来，还把脸埋在蓝色的斗篷里。“漂亮的小伙子啊，漂亮的小伙子，”她低沉地说，“那可是件可怕的事情。”渔夫甩了甩他棕色的卷发，笑了。“我的灵魂对我毫无用处。”他说，我看不见它。我触摸不到它。我更不了解它。”“要是我告诉了你，你拿什么回报我呢？”女巫一边用她那美丽的眼睛俯视他，一边问道。","The Witch grew pale, and shuddered, and hid her face in her blue mantle.“Pretty boy, pretty boy,” she muttered, “that is a terrible thing to do.” He tossed his brown curls and laughed.“My soul is nought to me,” he answered.“I cannot see it.I may not touch it.I do not know it.” “What wilt thou give me if I tell thee?” asked the Witch, looking down at him with her beautiful eyes."
"“五枚金币吧，”年轻的渔夫回答说，“还有我的渔网、我住的篱笆屋，以及我驾驶的漆过的船。只要你告诉我如何打发走我的灵魂，我就会把我所有的财产都送给你。”女巫嘲讽地笑了，又用那枝铁杉抽打他。“只要我愿意，我就可以把秋天的树叶变成黄金，”她答道，“把灰白的月光织成白银。世上所有国王财富的总和都比不上我所效劳的那个人多，并且国王们还受他的统治。”“那我要给你什么才好呢？”他大声叫喊着，“你既不要黄金也不要白银。”女巫用她纤细白嫩的手摸了摸渔夫的头发。“你得陪我跳舞，漂亮的小伙子。”她边轻轻地说，边朝他微笑。","“Five pieces of gold,” he said, “and my nets, and the wattled house where I live, and the painted boat in which I sail.Only tell me how to get rid of my soul, and I will give thee all that I possess.” She laughed mockingly at him, and struck him with the spray of hemlock.“I can turn the autumn leaves into gold,” she answered, “and I can weave the pale moonbeams into silver if I will it.He whom I serve is richer than all the kings of this world, and has their dominions.” “What then shall I give thee,” he cried, “if thy price be neither gold nor silver?” The Witch stroked his hair with her thin white hand.“Thou must dance with me, pretty boy,” she murmured, and she smiled at him as she spoke."
"“就这个吗？”年轻的渔夫惊诧地问道，并站起了身。","“Nought but that?” cried the young Fisherman in wonder and he rose to his feet."
"“就这个。”女巫答道，又朝他微笑着。","“Nought but that,” she answered, and she smiled at him again."
"“那么等到太阳下山后，我们就到一个隐秘的地方去跳舞，”他说，“跳完舞你要告诉我我想要知道的事情。”女巫摇摇头。“等到月圆的时候，等到月圆的时候。”她嘀咕着。接着她朝四下望了望，又听了听动静。一只蓝色鸟尖叫着从巢中飞起来，盘旋在沙丘上；三只带斑点的小鸟窸窸窣窣地穿过灰色的杂草，还相互窃窃私语。除此之外，就只有波浪冲洗水底光滑卵石的声音。女巫伸出手，将渔夫拉到身边，把干枯的嘴唇贴近他的耳朵。","“Then at sunset in some secret place we shall dance together,” he said, “and after that we have danced thou shalt tell me the thing which I desire to know.” She shook her head.“When the moon is full, when the moon is full,” she muttered.Then she peered all round, and listened.A blue bird rose screaming from its nest and circled over the dunes, and three spotted birds rustled through the coarse grey grass and whistled to each other.There was no other sound save the sound of a wave fretting the smooth pebbles below.So she reached out her hand, and drew him near to her and put her dry lips close to his ear."
"“今晚你一定要到山顶上来。”她小声说道，“今天是安息日，他会到这儿来的。”年轻的渔夫吃惊地望着她，她露出白白的牙齿，笑了。“你说的那个‘他’是什么人？”他问道。","“To-night thou must come to the top of the mountain,” she whispered.“It is a Sabbath, and He will be there.” The young Fisherman started and looked at her, and she showed her white teeth and laughed.“Who is He of whom thou speakest?” he asked."
"“这倒无关紧要。”她回答说，“今晚你一定要来，站在鹅耳枥树的树枝下，等我来。要是有条黑狗朝你跑来，你就用根柳条抽打它，它就会走开的。要是有只猫头鹰对你说话，不要理会它。月圆之时，我将和你在一起，我们将在草地上共舞。”“你愿意发誓你一定会告诉我如何把我的灵魂打发走吗？”他问道。","“It matters not,” she answered.“Go thou to-night, and stand under the branches of the hornbeam, and wait for my coming.If a black dog run towards thee, strike it with a rod of willow, and it will go away.If an owl speak to thee, make it no answer.When the moon is full I shall be with thee, and we will dance together on the grass.” “But wilt thou swear to me to tell me how I may send my soul from me?” he made question."
"她来到阳光底下，风轻轻吹拂着她的红发。“我以山羊的蹄子发誓。”她回答说。","She moved out into the sunlight, and through her red hair rippled the wind.“By the hoofs of the goat I swear it,” she made answer."
"“你是最好的女巫。”年轻的渔夫大声说，“今天晚上我一定到山顶上跟你一起跳舞。其实，我倒更情愿你向我要黄金或者白银。不过既然你需要这样的报酬，你会如愿以偿的，那不过是件小事。”说完年轻的渔夫取下帽子，朝她深深地点了一下头，就满心欢喜地跑回城里去了。","“Thou art the best of the witches,” cried the young Fisherman, “and I will surely dance with thee to-night on the top of the mountain.I would indeed that thou hadst asked of me either gold or silver.But such as thy price is thou shalt have it, for it is but a little thing.”And he doffed his cap to her, and bent his head low, and ran back to the town filled with a great joy."
"女巫目送他离去，等他的身影消失以后她才回到了自己的洞中。她从雕花的杉木匣子里取出一面镜子，把它放在一个架子上面，又在架子前用燃着的木炭点着了马鞭草，透过袅袅烟雾凝视着镜子。过了一会儿，她愤怒地捏紧拳头。“他本应该是我的。”她嘟囔道，“我跟她一样美丽。”","And the Witch watched him as he went, and when he had passed from her sight she entered her cave, and having taken a mirror from a box of carved cedarwood, she set it up on a frame, and burned vervain on lighted charcoal before it, and peered through the coils of the smoke.And after a time she clenched her hands in anger.“He should have been mine,” she muttered, “I am as fair as she is.” "
"那天晚上，月亮升起来后，年轻的渔夫爬到山顶，站在鹅耳枥树的树枝下。圆形的大海就在他的脚下，像一块被打磨光亮的金属圆盾；渔船的影子在小海湾里摇曳着。一只长着如硫磺般黄色眼睛的大猫头鹰叫起了他的名字，但他不予理会。一条黑狗朝他跑过来，汪汪地叫着。他用根柳条抽它，黑狗呜呜地叫着跑开了。","And that evening, when the moon had risen, the young Fisherman climbed up to the top of the mountain, and stood under the branches of the hornbeam.Like a targe of polished metal the round sea lay at his feet, and the shadows of the fishing-boats moved in the little bay.A great owl, with yellow sulphurous eyes, called to him by his name, but he made it no answer.A black dog ran towards him and snarled.He struck it with a rod of willow, and it went away whining."
"午夜，女巫们像蝙蝠似的从空中飞来了。“呸！”她们刚一着地就叫道，“这儿有个陌生人！”她们四处嗅着，叽叽喳喳地说着话，还做出各种暗号。最后赶来的是那个年轻的女巫。她的一头红发在风中飘舞着。她身穿一件金线织成的连衣裙，上面绣了很多孔雀眼睛，头戴一顶绿色的天鹅绒小帽。","At midnight the witches came flying through the air like bats.“Phew!” they cried, as they lit upon the ground, “there is some one here we know not!” and they sniffed about, and chattered to each other, and made signs.Last of all came the young Witch, with her red hair streaming in the wind.She wore a dress of gold tissue embroidered with peacocks’ eyes, and a little cap of green velvet was on her head."
"“他在哪儿？他在哪儿？”女巫们一看见她就尖声叫着问道；然而她只是笑了笑，跑到鹅耳枥树下面，牵着渔夫的手，把他领到月光下，跳起舞来。","“Where is he, where is he?” shrieked the witches when they saw her, but she only laughed, and ran to the hornbeam, and taking the Fisherman by the hand she led him out into the moonlight and began to dance."
"他们转了一圈又一圈，年轻的女巫跳得很高很高，渔夫都看得清她那猩红色的鞋跟。这时一阵马匹飞奔的蹄声朝着这群舞者冲了过来，可是并不见马的影子，渔夫便觉得害怕起来。","Round and round they whirled, and the young Witch jumped so high that he could see the scarlet heels of her shoes.Then right across the dancers came the sound of the galloping of a horse, but no horse was to be seen, and he felt afraid."
"“再快一点儿。”女巫大声说，又伸出手臂搂着他的脖子。她热乎乎的气息扑向他的脸。“再快点，再快点！”她大声叫道，他觉得脚下的地面都好像旋转了起来。他感到好难受，一股巨大的恐惧袭上身来，似乎有什么邪恶的东西在注视着他。最后他注意到岩石的阴影处有个人，可是先前那儿不曾有人的。","“Faster,” cried the Witch, and she threw her arms about his neck, and her breath was hot upon his face.“Faster, faster!” she cried, and the earth seemed to spin beneath his feet, and his brain grew troubled, and a great terror fell on him, as of some evil thing that was watching him, and at last he became aware that under the shadow of a rock there was a figure that had not been there before."
"那是一个男人，身穿一套黑色的天鹅绒服装，是按西班牙样式裁剪的。他脸色苍白，可他的嘴唇却好似一朵娇艳的玫瑰花。他看上去很疲倦，朝后倚着身子，有气无力地把玩着短剑的剑柄。他身旁的草地上放着一顶插着羽毛的帽子，一对骑马用的镶着金边蕾丝的手套，上面用小珍珠绣着非常奇特的图案。他肩披一件黑貂纹短斗篷，纤细白嫩的手上戴满了戒指。他的眼皮沉重地耷拉着。","It was a man dressed in a suit of black velvet, cut in the Spanish fashion.His face was strangely pale, but his lips were like a proud red flower.He seemed weary, and was leaning back toying in a listless manner with the pommel of his dagger.On the grass beside him lay a plumed hat, and a pair of riding-gloves gauntleted with gilt lace, and sewn with seed-pearls wrought into a curious device.A short cloak lined with sables hang from his shoulder, and his delicate white hands were gemmed with rings.Heavy eyelids drooped over his eyes."
"年轻的渔夫望着他，像中了什么咒语似的。终于，他跟那个人四目相对了。于是，不论年轻的渔夫跳舞跳到什么地方，他似乎都能感觉到那人的一双眼睛在一直注视着自己。他听到女巫笑了，于是搂住了她的腰，带着她疯狂地转起圈来。","The young Fisherman watched him, as one snared in a spell.At last their eyes met, and wherever he danced it seemed to him that the eyes of the man were upon him.He heard the Witch laugh, and caught her by the waist, and whirled her madly round and round."
"突然，一条狗在林子里叫了起来，跳舞的人停了下来，接着一对一对的舞伴走了过去，跪下去吻那个男人的手。女巫们吻那个男人时，他的嘴唇上浮出一丝骄傲的微笑，就像一只鸟掠过水面，使水面泛起涟漪。不过他的笑里带着蔑视。他仍然一直望着年轻的渔夫。","Suddenly a dog bayed in the wood, and the dancers stopped, and going up two by two, knelt down, and kissed the man’s hands.As they did so, a little smile touched his proud lips, as a bird’s wing touches the water and makes it laugh.But there was disdain in it.He kept looking at the young Fisherman."
"“走吧！我俩也去敬拜他。”女巫对年轻的渔夫耳语，又将他带上前去。当她恳求他去时，一股强大的欲望也促使他去那样做，于是他就跟随着她过去了。可当他走近那个男人时，他情不自禁地在自己的胸前画起了十字，还呼唤着圣名。","“Come! let us worship,” whispered the Witch, and she led him up, and a great desire to do as she besought him seized on him, and he followed her.But when he came close, and without knowing why he did it, he made on his breast the sign of the Cross, and called upon the holy name."
"他一做完这个，女巫们便都像老鹰似的尖叫着飞走了。那张一直盯着他的苍白的脸也痛苦地痉挛、扭曲起来。那个男人吹着口哨朝一个小树林中走去。一匹套着银制辔头的西班牙小马跑过来迎接他。那个男人跳上马鞍后，转过头来，悲伤地望了望年轻的渔夫。","No sooner had he done so than the witches screamed like hawks and flew away, and the pallid face that had been watching him twitched with a spasm of pain.The man went over to a little wood, and whistled.A jennet with silver trappings came running to meet him.As he leapt upon the saddle he turned round, and looked at the young Fisherman sadly."
"红发女巫也想飞走，然而渔夫抓住了她的手腕，紧紧地抓住了她。","And the Witch with the red hair tried to fly away also, but the Fisherman caught her by her wrists, and held her fast."
"“放开我，”她叫喊道，“让我走吧。你叫出了不该叫的名字，还做出了不该被看到的手势。”“不行，”渔夫回答说，“除非你把秘密告诉我，否则我是不会放你走的。”“什么秘密？”女巫问道，并像一只野猫似的挣扎着，还紧咬着她那冒着口沫的嘴唇。","“Loose me,” she cried, “and let me go.For thou hast named what should not be named, and shown the sign that may not be looked at.” “Nay,” he answered, “but I will not let thee go till thou hast told me the secret.” “What secret?” said the Witch, wrestling with him like a wild cat, and biting her foam-flecked lips."
"“你自己清楚。”渔夫回答说。","“Thou knowest,” he made answer."
"女巫那双草绿色的眼睛充满悲伤，泪水涟涟。她对渔夫说：“除了这个以外，你问我什么都可以！”渔夫笑了，把女巫抓得更紧。","Her grass-green eyes grew dim with tears, and she said to the Fisherman, “Ask me anything but that!” He laughed, and held her all the more tightly."
"当女巫意识到自己跑不掉时，她便悄声对渔夫说：“其实，我跟海的女儿一样美丽，跟那些住在碧蓝海水中的少女们一样可爱。”说完就向他献媚，把脸朝他的脸凑过去。","And when she saw that she could not free herself, she whispered to him, “Surely I am as fair as the daughters of the sea, and as comely as those that dwell in the blue waters,” and she fawned on him and put her face close to his."
"但是渔夫皱着眉头把她推开，并对她说：“如果你不能履行对我所做的承诺，你就是个假女巫，我就会杀了你。”女巫的脸一下子就变得跟南欧紫荆树的花朵一样灰白，她浑身颤抖起来。“既然如此，”她嘀咕说，“这是你的灵魂，不关我的事。你自己看着办吧。”女巫从腰带上取出一把青蛇皮刀柄的小刀，交给了渔夫。","But he thrust her back frowning, and said to her, “If thou keepest not the promise that thou madest to me I will slay thee for a false witch.”  She grew grey as a blossom of the Judas tree, and shuddered.“Be it so,” she muttered.“It is thy soul and not mine.Do with it as thou wilt.”And she took from her girdle a little knife that had a handle of green viper’s skin, and gave it to him."
"“这个东西对我有什么用呢？”渔夫疑惑地问她。","“What shall this serve me?” he asked of her, wondering."
"女巫沉默了一会儿，一脸恐惧。随后她拂开垂在前额的头发，诡异地笑着对他说：“人们所说的影子其实并不是身体的影子，而是灵魂。你背对着月亮站在海滩上，两脚周围的影子就是你的灵魂。你拿刀砍掉它，命令你的灵魂离开你，它就会照你说的去做。”年轻的渔夫听了浑身颤抖。“真的是这样吗？”他低声问。","She was silent for a few moments, and a look of terror came over her face.Then she brushed her hair back from her forehead, and smiling strangely she said to him, “What men call the shadow of the body is not the shadow of the body, but is the body of the soul.Stand on the sea-shore with thy back to the moon, and cut away from around thy feet thy shadow, which is thy soul’s body, and bid thy soul leave thee, and it will do so.” The young Fisherman trembled.“Is this true?” he murmured."
"“是真的，不过我倒希望没有告诉你这件事。”女巫大声说，并抱住渔夫的双膝哭了起来。","“It is true, and I would that I had not told thee of it,” she cried, and she clung to his knees weeping."
"他把她从身边推开，走向悬崖边，把她留在了茂密的草丛中，又把小刀别进腰带里，开始爬下悬崖。","He put her from him and left her in the rank grass, and going to the edge of the mountain he placed the knife in his belt and began to climb down."
"他的灵魂在他的体内呼唤着他，对他说：“瞧！我跟你呆了这么多年，一直忠心耿耿地服侍你。请不要打发我走，我对你做了什么坏事吗？”年轻的渔夫笑了。“你什么也没做错，只是我不再需要你了。”他回答说，“世界这么广阔，有天堂，有地狱，还有天地间灯火阑珊的人家。　到你喜欢的地方去吧，不要再来打扰我。我的爱人在召唤我。”他的灵魂苦苦地哀求他，但他丝毫不予理会。他跳过一块又一块岩石，步伐矫健地如一头野山羊。最后他终于踏上了平地，来到了黄色的海滩上。","And his Soul that was within him called out to him and said, “Lo! I have dwelt with thee for all these years, and have been thy servant.Send me not away from thee now, for what evil have I done thee?” And the young Fisherman laughed.“Thou hast done me no evil, but I have no need of thee,” he answered.“The world is wide, and there is Heaven also, and Hell, and that dim twilight house that lies between.Go wherever thou wilt, but trouble me not, for my love is calling to me.” And his soul besought him piteously, but he heeded it not, but leapt from crag to crag, being sure-footed as a wild goat, and at least he reached the level ground and the yellow shore of the sea."
"渔夫背对着月亮站在沙滩上，古铜色的四肢和结实的肌肉使他看上去像一座希腊式雕像。好多白色的胳膊从海水泡沫中伸出来召唤他，还有一些朦胧的影子从波涛中升起来向他行礼。他面前显现出他的影子，正是他的灵魂；而他身后昏黄的夜空上悬挂着一轮明月。","Bronze-limbed and well-knit, like a statue wrought by a Grecian, he stood on the sand with his back to the moon, and out of the foam came white arms that beckoned to him, and out of the waves rose dim forms that did him homage.Before him lay his shadow, which was the body of his soul, and behind him hung the moon in the honey-coloured air."
"这时他的灵魂对他说：“如果你真要赶我走的话，请让我也带走你的心吧。世界太残酷了，让你的心跟我作伴吧。”年轻的渔夫摇摇头，笑了。“要是我把心给了你，那我拿什么爱我的心上人呢？”他大声说。","And his Soul said to him, “If indeed thou must drive me from thee, send me not forth without a heart.The world is cruel, give me thy heart to take with me.” He tossed his head and smiled.“With what should I love my love if I gave thee my heart?” he cried."
"“不，你就发发善心吧，”他的灵魂说，“把你的心给我。这个世界太残酷了，我害怕孤身一个。”“我的心是属于我的心上人的，”他回答说，“不要磨蹭了，你快点离开吧。”“难道我就不值得爱吗？”他的灵魂问道。","“Nay, but be merciful,” said his Soul: “give me thy heart, for the world is very cruel, and I am afraid.” “My heart is my love”s,” he answered, “therefore tarry not, but get thee gone.” “Should I not love also?” asked his Soul."
"“你快走吧，我已经不需要你了。”年轻的渔夫吼道。接着他抽出那把青蛇皮刀柄的小刀，朝他两脚周围的影子砍去。影子立即站了起来，立在他跟前，望着他，那样子简直跟他本人没有区别。","“Get thee gone, for I have no need of thee,” cried the young Fisherman, and he took the little knife with its handle of green viper’s skin, and cut away his shadow from around his feet, and it rose up and stood before him, and looked at him, and it was even as himself."
"他吓得直后退，麻利地把小刀别进自己的腰带里，一股莫名的恐惧袭遍全身。“快走吧，”他低声说，“不要再让我看见你。”“不，我们一定会再见面的。”灵魂说。它用长笛般的声音低沉地说道，嘴唇动都不动一下。","He crept back, and thrust the knife into his belt, and a feeling of awe came over him.“Get thee gone,” he murmured, “and let me see thy face no more.” “Nay, but we must meet again,” said the Soul.Its voice was low and flute-like, and its lips hardly moved while it spake."
"“我们怎么会再见面呢？”年轻的渔夫大声问，“难道你还会跟我到深海里去吗？”“每年我都会到这儿来一次，到时我会呼唤你的。”灵魂说，“或许你还有需要我的时候。”“我还要你做什么呢？”年轻的渔夫大声问道，“不过你愿意来就来吧。”说完就一头扎进海里去了。特赖登们吹响他们的号角，小美人鱼游上去迎接他，并伸出她的手臂搂住他的脖子，亲吻他的嘴。","“How shall we meet?” cried the young Fisherman.“Thou wilt not follow me into the depths of the sea?” “Once every year I will come to this place, and call to thee,” said the Soul.“It may be that thou wilt have need of me.” “What need should I have of thee?” cried the young Fisherman, “but be it as thou wilt,” and he plunged into the waters and the Tritons blew their horns and the little Mermaid rose up to meet him, and put her arms around his neck and kissed him on the mouth."
"灵魂孤零零地站在沙滩上，望着他们。等他们沉入海里后，灵魂也哭泣着离开了沼泽地。","And the Soul stood on the lonely beach and watched them.And when they had sunk down into the sea, it went weeping away over the marshes."
"一年后，灵魂来到海滩上，呼唤年轻的渔夫。渔夫从海底浮了上来，问道：“你唤我干什么呢？”灵魂答道：“靠近一点儿，我好与你说话，因为我见识了好多奇妙的事情。”于是他靠近了一点儿，躺在浅滩上，用手托着头，倾听着。","And after a year was over the Soul came down to the shore of the sea and called to the young Fisherman, and he rose out of the deep, and said, “Why dost thou call to me?” And the Soul answered, “Come nearer, that I may speak with thee, for I have seen marvellous things.” So he came nearer, and couched in the shallow water, and leaned his head upon his hand and listened."
"灵魂对他讲道：“离开你以后，我就转身到东方旅行去了。东方充满着智慧。我在路上走了六天，第七天早晨来到了一座小山前，它位于鞑靼人的国土上。我坐在一棵柽柳下庇荫。那个国家非常干燥，土地被烈日炙烤得发烫。人们在平原上来来回回地走着，就像飞蝇在磨光的铜盘子上面爬来爬去似的。","And the Soul said to him, “When I left thee I turned my face to the East and journeyed.From the East cometh everything that is wise.Six days I journeyed, and on the morning of the seventh day I came to a hill that is in the country of the Tartars.I sat down under the shade of a tamarisk tree to shelter myself from the sun.The land was dry and burnt up with the heat.The people went to and fro over the plain like flies crawling upon a disk of polished copper."
"“正午的时候，地平线上升起了一团红色沙尘。鞑靼人见到这一幕时，就拉开他们油漆过的弓箭，跳上小马，朝着那个方向狂奔而去。女人们尖叫着逃进马车里，躲在毛毡帘子后面。","“When it was noon a cloud of red dust rose up from the flat rim of the land.When the Tartars saw it, they strung their painted bows, and having leapt upon their little horses they galloped to meet it.The women fled screaming to the waggons, and hid themselves behind the felt curtains."
"“黄昏时候，鞑靼人回来了，但是少了五个人，而且在回来的人中也有不少人受了伤。他们将马套在马车上后便匆匆上路了。这时三只胡狼从洞中出来，在后面对他们虎视眈眈。它们用鼻孔四处嗅了嗅，就往相反的方向跑开了。","“At twilight the Tartars returned, but five of them were missing, and of those that came back not a few had been wounded.They harnessed their horses to the waggons and drove hastily away.Three jackals came out of a cave and peered after them.Then they sniffed up the air with their nostrils, and trotted off in the opposite direction."
"“等到月亮升起来，我看见平原上燃起了篝火，便朝那个方向跑去了。一群商人围着火堆坐在地毯上。他们的骆驼拴在身后的木桩上，黑人奴隶们正在沙地上搭建鞣皮帐篷，还用仙人掌筑起高高的围墙。","“When the moon rose I saw a camp-fire burning on the plain, and went towards it.A company of merchants were seated round it on carpets.Their camels were picketed behind them, and the negroes who were their servants were pitching tents of tanned skin upon the sand, and making a high wall of the prickly pear."
"“当我走近他们时，商人中的头领站起来，拔出他的剑，问我是做什么的。","“As I came near them, the chief of the merchants rose up and drew his sword, and asked me my business."
"“我说我是我自己领地上的王子，从鞑靼逃出来，那里的人想抓我给他们当奴隶。头领笑了，指给我看挂在长芦苇上的五个人头。","“I answered that I was a Prince in my own land, and that I had escaped from the Tartars, who had sought to make me their slave.The chief smiled, and showed me five heads fixed upon long reeds of bamboo."
"“随后他问我谁是上帝的先知，我告诉他是穆罕默德。","“Then he asked me who was the prophet of God, and I answered him Mohammed."
"“听到伪先知的名字后，他朝我鞠了个躬，并拉起我的手，让我坐在他的旁边。一个黑奴用木碗盛了些马奶给我端上来，外带一块烤熟的羊羔肉。","“When he heard the name of the false prophet, he bowed and took me by the hand, and placed me by his side.A negro brought me some mare’s milk in a wooden dish, and a piece of lamb’s flesh roasted."
"“黎明时我们上路了。我骑着一匹红毛骆驼，走在头领的旁边。一个跑腿的扛着根长矛跑在我们的前边。士兵护卫在我们两边，骡子驮着商品跟在后面。这个商队有四十只骆驼、八十头骡子。","“At daybreak we started on our journey.I rode on a red-haired camel by the side of the chief, and a runner ran before us carrying a spear.The men of war were on either hand, and the mules followed with the merchandise.There were forty camels in the caravan, and the mules were twice forty in number."
"“我们从鞑靼人的国土来到了另一个国度，那里的人们诅咒月亮。我们见到狮身鹰首兽在白色岩石上守卫自己的黄金，还见到带鳞甲的龙在它们的山洞中睡得正香。翻越群山时，我们都屏住呼吸，生怕积雪会落下来压倒我们。另外，我们每个人的眼睛上都蒙了一块纱布。穿越山谷时，俾格米小矮人从树洞中朝我们射箭；夜晚，我们听见野人在击鼓作乐。经过猴塔时，我们在猴子面前放了些水果，它们就不会伤害我们了。经过蛇塔时，我们便用铜碗盛些热奶给它们喝，它们就让我们顺利通过。旅途中我们三次经过阿姆河的岸边。我们乘木筏渡河，木筏由胀鼓鼓的兽皮嚢托着。河马怒气冲冲地对着我们，还想把我们通通吃掉。骆驼见它们那暴怒的样子也都不寒而栗。","“We went from the country of the Tartars into the country of those who curse the Moon.We saw the Gryphons guarding their gold on the white rocks, and the scaled Dragons sleeping in their caves.As we passed over the mountains we held our breath lest the snows might fall on us, and each man tied a veil of gauze before his eyes.As we passed through the valleys the Pygmies shot arrows at us from the hollows of the trees, and at night-time we heard the wild men beating on their drums.When we came to the Tower of Apes we set fruits before them, and they did not harm us.When we came to the Tower of Serpents we gave them warm milk in bowls of brass, and they let us go by.Three times in our journey we came to the banks of the Oxus.We crossed it on rafts of wood with great bladders of blown hide.The river-horses raged against us and sought to slay us.When the camels saw them they trembled."
"“每座城邦的君主都向我们征收通行费，却不批准我们进城。他们从墙头上给我们扔下面包、小块烘烤的蜂蜜玉米糕，以及上等面粉做的枣馅面饼。我们每次拿一粒琥珀珠子换他们一百篮子食物。","“The kings of each city levied tolls on us, but would not suffer us to enter their gates.They threw us bread over the walls, little maize-cakes baked in honey and cakes of fine flour filled with dates.For every hundred baskets we gave them a bead of amber."
"“看到我们走近村子时，村民便往水井里撒毒药，然后逃到山顶上去。我们与马格达人交过战，那些人出生时是老人，以后就一年比一年变得年轻，死时是小孩子。我们还同拉克特罗伊人打过仗，他们自诩是老虎的儿子，把自己涂成黑黄两种颜色。我们也同奥兰特斯人打过仗，他们把死者埋葬在树顶上。这些人都住在黑暗的洞穴里，因为害怕太阳——他们的神——会杀死他们。我们跟克里安人交过战，他们崇拜鳄鱼，给它戴上绿色的玻璃耳环，用黄油和新鲜禽肉喂养它。我们与阿加中拜打了仗，他们长着狗一般的面孔。我们还跟长着马蹄的希班人打过仗，他们跑得比马还快。我们队伍中有三分之一的人阵亡，另外有三分之一的人因饥饿而死掉。幸存的人都抱怨我，说是我给他们带去了厄运。我便从一块石头下面捉起一条有角的小毒蛇，让它来咬我。当看见我没有中毒时，他们变得害怕起来。","“When the dwellers in the villages saw us coming, they poisoned the wells and fled to the hill-summits.We fought with the Magadae who are born old, and grow younger and younger every year, and die when they are little children; and with the Laktroi who say that they are the sons of tigers, and paint themselves yellow and black; and with the Aurantes who bury their dead on the tops of trees, and themselves live in dark caverns lest the Sun, who is their god, should slay them; and with the Krimnians who worship a crocodile, and give it earrings of green glass, and feed it with butter and fresh fowls; and with the Agazonbae, who are dog-faced; and with the Sibans, who have horses’ feet, and run more swiftly than horses.A third of our company died in battle, and a third died of want.The rest murmured against me, and said that I had brought them an evil fortune.I took a horned adder from beneath a stone and let it sting me.When they saw that I did not sicken they grew afraid."
"过了三个月，我们来到伊勒尔市。我们到达城墙外的小树林时已经是夜里。由于月亮到天蝎宫串门去了，空气十分闷热。我们从树上摘下成熟的石榴，剥开皮，喝里面的甜汁。随后我们就躺在地毯上，等待着黎明。","“In the fourth month we reached the city of Illel.It was night-time when we came to the grove that is outside the walls, and the air was sultry, for the Moon was travelling in Scorpion.We took the ripe pomegranates from the trees, and brake them, and drank their sweet juices.Then we lay down on our carpets, and waited for the dawn."
"天刚亮我们就爬起来，去敲城门。城门是用红铜做成的，上面刻有海龙和翼龙。卫兵从城垛上向下张望，问我们是干什么的。商队的翻译告诉对方我们从叙利亚岛来，带着很多商品。他们要了我们几个人作人质，还告诉我们到中午时才能打开城门，吩咐我们耐心等待。","“And at dawn we rose and knocked at the gate of the city.It was wrought out of red bronze, and carved with sea-dragons and dragons that have wings.The guards looked down from the battlements and asked us our business.The interpreter of the caravan answered that we had come from the island of Syria with much merchandise.They took hostages, and told us that they would open the gate to us at noon, and bade us tarry till then."
"正午时分，他们打开了城门。我们进城时，人们一群群地从屋里跑出来看我们。一个街头传话人用海螺把我们到来的消息在城里传了个遍。我们来到集市上，黑奴解开花布包裹，打开雕花的枫木箱子。等他们布置完了这些事后，商人们便摆出了各种新奇的物件：有来自埃及的蜡染亚麻布，来自埃塞俄比亚的花亚麻布，来自苏尔的紫色海绵，还有来自西顿的蓝色帷帘、冰凉的琥珀杯子、精致玻璃器皿和奇妙的陶器。一群女人在一家屋顶上看着我们。其中一个戴着一副镀金的皮革面具。","“When it was noon they opened the gate, and as we entered in the people came crowding out of the houses to look at us, and a crier went round the city crying through a shell.We stood in the market-place, and the negroes uncorded the bales of figured cloths and opened the carved chests of sycamore.And when they had ended their task, the merchants set forth their strange wares, the waxed linen from Egypt and the painted linen from the country of the Ethiops, the purple sponges from Tyre and the blue hangings from Sidon, the cups of cold amber and the fine vessels of glass and the curious vessels of burnt clay.From the roof of a house a company of women watched us.One of them wore a mask of gilded leather."
"第一天来与我们交易的是神父，第二天来的是贵族，第三天来的是手艺人和奴隶。只要商人在城中逗留，他们便按这种习俗接待他们。","“And on the first day the priests came and bartered with us, and on the second day came the nobles, and on the third day came the craftsmen and the slaves.And this is their custom with all merchants as long as they tarry in the city."
"我们在那儿停留了一个月。有一晚月色惨淡，我觉得百无聊赖，就到城里的大街上四处游荡，来到了本城神庙的花园中。我看见身着黄袍的神父们静悄悄地穿过郁郁葱葱的树林。黑色大理石砌的地面上立着一座玫瑰红的房子，里面供奉着他们的神。房门上镀了一层金粉，上面凸现出金光闪闪的公牛和孔雀。倾斜的房顶是用海绿色瓷瓦盖成的，斜出的屋檐上悬挂着小风铃。白鸽飞过时，它们用翅膀扑打风铃，风铃便叮叮当当地响起来。","“And we tarried for a moon, and when the moon was waning, I wearied and wandered away through the streets of the city and came to the garden of its god.The priests in their yellow robes moved silently through the green trees, and on a pavement of black marble stood the rose-red house in which the god had his dwelling.Its doors were of powdered lacquer, and bulls and peacocks were wrought on them in raised and polished gold.The tilted roof was of sea-green porcelain, and the jutting eaves were festooned with little bells.When the white doves flew past, they struck the bells with their wings and made them tinkle."
"“寺院前面有一个用条纹缟玛瑙铺砌的清水池。我躺在水池边，用苍白的手指摩挲着那些大片大片的落叶。其中一位神父朝我走来，站在我的身后。他脚上穿着便鞋，一只是软蛇皮做的，另一只是鸟的羽毛做的。他头戴一顶黑毡的主教僧帽，上面饰着银制的新月。他的长袍上编织着七道黄色条纹，卷曲的头发上抹着一层锑粉。","“In front of the temple was a pool of clear water paved with veined onyx.I lay down beside it, and with my pale fingers I touched the broad leaves.One of the priests came towards me and stood behind me.He had sandals on his feet, one of soft serpent-skin and the other of birds’ plumage.On his head was a mitre of black felt decorated with silver crescents.Seven yellows were woven into his robe, and his frizzed hair was stained with antimony."
"过了一会儿，他开口跟我说话，问我想要什么。","“After a little while he spake to me, and asked me my desire."
"我告诉他我想见到神。","“I told him that my desire was to see the god."
"‘神打猎去了，’神父说，并用他那斜着的小眼睛好奇地打量我。","““The god is hunting,” said the priest, looking strangely at me with his small slanting eyes."
"‘告诉我他在哪一片树林，我要同他一块儿骑马。’我答道。","““Tell me in what forest, and I will ride with him,” I answered."
"他用长长的尖指甲梳理着长袍边上软软的流苏。‘神睡着了。’他含糊不清地回答我。","“He combed out the soft fringes of his tunic with his long pointed nails.“The god is asleep,” he murmured."
"‘告诉我是哪一个沙发，我要去看护他。’我又说。","““Tell me on what couch, and I will watch by him,” I answered."
"‘神在出席宴会。’他大叫道。","““The god is at the feast,” he cried."
"‘宴会上的酒若是甜的，我要与他同干；若是苦的，我也要与他共饮。’我这么回答他。","““If the wine be sweet I will drink it with him, and if it be bitter I will drink it with him also,” was my answer."
"他对我的话无比惊叹，于是躬身向我致敬，并拉起我的手，领我到寺院。","“He bowed his head in wonder, and, taking me by the hand, he raised me up, and led me into the temple."
"在第一间房子里，我看见一个翠玉宝座，上面安放着一尊神像，宝座边上镶嵌着夺目的东方珍珠。那尊神像是用乌木雕刻成的，跟真人一般大小。它前额上有一块红宝石，厚厚的油从它发间滴下来，落到它的大腿上。它的双脚被新宰的小羊羔的血染红了，腰间束着一根铜腰带，腰带上镶着七颗绿玉。","“And in the first chamber I saw an idol seated on a throne of jasper bordered with great orient pearls.It was carved out of ebony, and in stature was of the stature of a man.On its forehead was a ruby, and thick oil dripped from its hair on to its thighs.Its feet were red with the blood of a newly-slain kid, and its loins girt with a copper belt that was studded with seven beryls."
"我问那位神父：‘这就是神吗？’他答道：‘这就是神。’","“And I said to the priest, “Is this the god?”And he answered me, “This is the god.”"
"‘快带我去见神，’我大声吼道，‘要不然我一定要你的命。’我摸了一下他的手，那只手一下子就形容枯槁了。","““Show me the god,” I cried, “or I will surely slay thee.”And I touched his hand, and it became withered."
"神父恳求我说：‘请我的主将他的仆人治愈吧，我就要带他去见神了。’","“And the priest besought me, saying, “Let my lord heal his servant, and I will show him the god.”"
"‘我便朝他手上吹气，他的手又复原了。于是他哆哆嗦嗦地把我领进第二间房。我看见一个挂着大绿宝石的翡翠莲花座，上面立着一尊神像。这尊神像是用象牙雕刻的，体型有普通人的两倍那么大。它前额上有一块橄榄石，胸膛抹着没药和桂皮香料。它一只手拿着一根翡翠曲柄杖，另一只手握着一个圆圆的水晶球。它脚上穿着黄铜制的高筒靴，粗脖子上套着一个透明石膏环。","“So I breathed with my breath upon his hand, and it became whole again, and he trembled and led me into the second chamber, and I saw an idol standing on a lotus of jade hung with great emeralds.It was carved out of ivory, and in stature was twice the stature of a man.On its forehead was a chrysolite, and its breasts were smeared with myrrh and cinnamon.In one hand it held a crooked sceptre of jade, and in the other a round crystal.It ware buskins of brass, and its thick neck was circled with a circle of selenites."
"“我又问神父：‘这就是神吗？’","“And I said to the priest, “Is this the god?”"
"“他回答我说：‘这就是神。’","“And he answered me, ‘This is the god.’"
"“‘快带我去见神，’我又大声吼道，‘否则我就杀了你。’接着我又摸了一下他的眼睛，他马上就变瞎了。","“‘Show me the god,’ I cried, ‘or I will surely slay thee.’And I touched his eyes, and they became blind."
"“神父恳求我说：‘请我的主将他的仆人治愈吧，我就要带他去见神了。’","“And the priest besought me, saying, ‘Let my lord heal his servant, and I will show him the god.’"
"“于是我朝他眼睛上吹气，他马上又复明了，战战兢兢地带我走进了第三间房。看哪！原来那里也没有神，甚至连神像都没有，唯独有一面圆圆的金属镜子放在一个石头祭坛上。","“So I breathed with my breath upon his eyes, and the sight came back to them, and he trembled again, and led me into the third chamber, and lo! there was no idol in it, nor image of any kind, but only a mirror of round metal set on an altar of stone."
"“我再次问神父：‘神究竟在什么地方？’","“And I said to the priest, ‘Where is the god?’"
"“他答道：‘这里没有神，唯有你眼前的这面镜子，它是智慧之镜。它能照出天上人间的一切，除了镜中人。它若照不出镜中人，那么那人就是最有智慧的。这儿还有很多镜子，不过都是意见之镜。唯独这一面是智慧之镜。拥有这面镜子的人能洞悉世间的一切，没有什么可以瞒过他们。谁没有这面镜子，谁就没有智慧。所以，我们把它看成是神，崇拜它。’于是我朝镜子里看去，真的像他说的那样子。","“And he answered me: ‘There is no god but this mirror that thou seest, for this is the Mirror of Wisdom.And it reflecteth all things that are in heaven and on earth, save only the face of him who looketh into it.This it reflecteth not, so that he who looketh into it may be wise.Many other mirrors are there, but they are mirrors of Opinion.This only is the Mirror of Wisdom.And they who possess this mirror know everything, nor is there anything hidden from them.And they who possess it not have not Wisdom.Therefore is it the god, and we worship it.’And I looked into the mirror, and it was even as he had said to me."
"“后来我做了一件荒唐事，其实也没什么。我把智慧之镜藏在一个山谷里，那地方离这里只有一天的行程。我恳求你再让我回到你的身体里，做你的仆人吧。这样你就会比所有聪明的人更聪明，智慧也就属于你了。请让我回到你的身体里吧，那么你就成了世界上最聪明的人了。”但年轻的渔夫笑了。“爱情比智慧更美妙，”他大喊道，“而且小美人鱼爱着我。”“不，没有什么比智慧更美妙了。”灵魂说。","“And I did a strange thing, but what I did matters not, for in a valley that is but a day’s journey from this place have I hidden the Mirror of Wisdom.Do but suffer me to enter into thee again and be thy servant, and thou shalt be wiser than all the wise men, and Wisdom shall be thine.Suffer me to enter into thee, and none will be as wise as thou.” But the young Fisherman laughed.“Love is better than Wisdom,” he cried, “and the little Mermaid loves me.” “Nay, but there is nothing better than Wisdom,” said the Soul."
"“爱情更美妙。”说完年轻的渔夫就跳到深海里去了，灵魂只好哭泣着穿过沼泽地离开了。","“Love is better,” answered the young Fisherman, and he plunged into the deep, and the Soul went weeping away over the marshes."
"第二年也过去了，灵魂又一次来到了海滩上，呼唤着年轻的渔夫。渔夫从水中冒出来，问道：“你唤我干什么呢？”灵魂回答说：“靠近一点儿，我好与你说话，我见识了许多奇妙的事情。”于是他靠近了一点儿，躺在浅滩上，用手托着头，倾听着。","And after the second year was over, the Soul came down to the shore of the sea, and called to the young Fisherman, and he rose out of the deep and said, “Why dost thou call to me?” And the Soul answered, “Come nearer, that I may speak with thee, for I have seen marvellous things.” So he came nearer, and couched in the shallow water, and leaned his head upon his hand and listened."
"灵魂对他说：“离开你以后，我转身就到南方旅行去了。南方尽显财富。我沿着通向爱西特市的公路走了整整六天，那是一条连朝圣者都不愿走的尘土飞扬的红漆公路。到了第七天，我抬头望去，看哪！城市就横躺在我的脚下，因为它就位于山谷中。","And the Soul said to him, “When I left thee, I turned my face to the South and journeyed.From the South cometh everything that is precious.Six days I journeyed along the highways that lead to the city of Ashter, along the dusty red-dyed highways by which the pilgrims are wont to go did I journey, and on the morning of the seventh day I lifted up my eyes, and lo! the city lay at my feet, for it is in a valley."
"“有九个大门通向城里，每个城门前都立着一匹青铜马。每当贝都因人从山上下来时，马便仰天长啸。城墙上都裹着铜皮，城墙上的瞭望塔也是用黄铜搭的屋顶。每个塔上都站着一名手执弓箭的射手。日出时，他用一支箭敲响铜锣；日落时，他就会吹响号角。","“There are nine gates to this city, and in front of each gate stands a bronze horse that neighs when the Bedouins come down from the mountains.The walls are cased with copper, and the watch-towers on the walls are roofed with brass.In every tower stands an archer with a bow in his hand.At sunrise he strikes with an arrow on a gong, and at sunset he blows through a horn of horn."
"“我正准备进城时，守卫把我拦住，问我是什么人。我回答说我是个苦行僧，正要赶往麦加城去。那儿有一副绿色的帐幕，上面有天使亲手用银线绣出的《古兰经》经文。他们对我的话充满惊讶，就放我进去了。","“When I sought to enter, the guards stopped me and asked of me who I was.I made answer that I was a Dervish and on my way to the city of Mecca, where there was a green veil on which the Koran was embroidered in silver letters by the hands of the angels.They were filled with wonder, and entreated me to pass in."
"“城里热闹非凡，简直就是个大集市。你真该跟我一起去的。窄窄的街道上，鲜艳的纸灯笼像一只只大彩蝶般翩翩飞舞。风吹过屋顶时，这些灯笼一起一伏，就像五颜六色的泡泡。商人们坐在丝织地毯上，面前摆着货摊。他们的胡须又直又黑，包头巾上镶嵌着装饰用的金色金属亮片，手里熟练地玩着长串的琥珀和桃核雕。他们中有的卖波斯树脂和甘松油，也有的出售来自印度洋各岛屿的奇妙香水、黏稠的红玫瑰油，以及没药和小钉子形状的丁香。每当有人走上去与他们搭讪，他们就一把一把地往炭火盆中添加乳香，于是空气中便氤氲着香气。我看见一个叙利亚人，他手里拿着一根看似芦苇杆的细棍子。那棍子燃烧时，升起缕缕灰白色的烟雾，还散发出有如春天里粉色扁桃花的味道。另一些人在出售嵌满了纯蓝绿松石的手镯、黄铜线上面挂着珍珠流苏的脚镯，以及镶金的老虎爪、猫爪和豹爪，还有绿宝石耳环、镂空的翡翠戒指。茶馆里传出弹奏六弦琴的声音；抽大烟的人面无血丝，笑望着行人。","“Inside it is even as a bazaar.Surely thou shouldst have been with me.Across the narrow streets the gay lanterns of paper flutter like large butterflies.When the wind blows over the roofs they rise and fall as painted bubbles do.In front of their booths sit the merchants on silken carpets.They have straight black beards, and their turbans are covered with golden sequins, and long strings of amber and carved peach-stones glide through their cool fingers.Some of them sell galbanum and nard, and curious perfumes from the islands of the Indian Sea, and the thick oil of red roses, and myrrh and little nail-shaped cloves.When one stops to speak to them, they throw pinches of frankincense upon a charcoal brazier and make the air sweet.I saw a Syrian who held in his hands a thin rod like a reed.Grey threads of smoke came from it, and its odour as it burned was as the odour of the pink almond in spring.Others sell silver bracelets embossed all over with creamy blue turquoise stones, and anklets of brass wire fringed with little pearls, and tigers’ claws set in gold, and the claws of that gilt cat, the leopard, set in gold also, and earrings of pierced emerald, and finger-rings of hollowed jade.From the tea-houses comes the sound of the guitar, and the opium-smokers with their white smiling faces look out at the passers-by."
"“你真该跟我一起去见识见识的。卖酒的人肩扛黑色大皮囊，用胳膊肘在人群中挤出一条路。他们中的大部分人都卖一种叫西拉兹的酒，那酒跟蜜糖一样甜。他们把酒装在小金属杯子里，上面撒些玫瑰花瓣。集市上还有水果商，他们卖各种各样的水果：有熟透的无花果，因挤压而露出了紫色的果肉，有味似麝香、色如黄宝石的甜瓜，有香橼、蒲桃和一串串的白葡萄，还有圆溜溜、黄橙橙的橘子和椭圆形的青黄柠檬。有一次我看见一头大象从我身边走过。它的鼻子上涂着朱砂和姜黄，耳朵上套着一个深红色的丝网。它在一个水果摊的对面站住了，吃起橘子来，那个卖水果的人只是笑了笑。你无法想象那些人是多么奇怪。若高兴时，他们就会到卖鸟人那儿买一只笼中鸟，然后把鸟放飞，那时他们就会更加高兴；而伤心的时候他们便用荆棘抽打自己，这样他们就会一直伤心。","“Of a truth thou shouldst have been with me.The wine-sellers elbow their way through the crowd with great black skins on their shoulders.Most of them sell the wine of Schiraz, which is as sweet as honey.They serve it in little metal cups and strew rose leaves upon it.In the market-place stand the fruitsellers, who sell all kinds of fruit: ripe figs, with their bruised purple flesh, melons, smelling of musk and yellow as topazes, citrons and rose-apples and clusters of white grapes, round red-gold oranges, and oval lemons of green gold.Once I saw an elephant go by.Its trunk was painted with vermilion and turmeric, and over its ears it had a net of crimson silk cord.It stopped opposite one of the booths and began eating the oranges, and the man only laughed.Thou canst not think how strange a people they are.When they are glad they go to the bird-sellers and buy of them a caged bird, and set it free that their joy may be greater, and when they are sad they scourge themselves with thorns that their sorrow may not grow less."
"“一天夜里，我遇见一些黑奴抬着一个沉甸甸的轿子从集市上走过。轿子是用竹子做的，上面镀了金，轿杆刷了朱红色的漆，上面还镶嵌着黄铜雕的孔雀。轿窗上垂挂着薄薄的棉纱幔，上面装饰着甲虫的翅膀和小粒珍珠。轿子从我身旁经过时，一个脸色苍白的赛加西亚人探出头，对我微笑。我跟在轿子后头，黑奴们加快了步伐，还皱眉表示不满。可是我一点儿也不在意。我觉得有一股强烈的好奇心在驱使着我。","“One evening I met some negroes carrying a heavy palanquin through the bazaar.It was made of gilded bamboo, and the poles were of vermilion lacquer studded with brass peacocks.Across the windows hung thin curtains of muslin embroidered with beetles’ wings and with tiny seed-pearls, and as it passed by a pale-faced Circassian looked out and smiled at me.I followed behind, and the negroes hurried their steps and scowled.But I did not care.I felt a great curiosity come over me."
"“最后他们在一座正方形的白房子前停了下来。房子连扇窗户都没有，只有一扇像墓门一样的小门。他们放下轿子，用一个铜锤把门连敲了三下。一个身穿绿色皮制长袖上衣的亚美尼亚人从门洞里朝外张望，当看清是他们后就开了门。那人还在地上铺了张地毯，接着轿中的女人走了出来。她进屋时，又扭过头，再次朝我微笑。我从未见过像她那么脸色苍白的人。","“At last they stopped at a square white house.There were no windows to it, only a little door like the door of a tomb.They set down the palanquin and knocked three times with a copper hammer.An Armenian in a caftan of green leather peered through the wicket, and when he saw them he opened, and spread a carpet on the ground, and the woman stepped out.As she went in, she turned round and smiled at me again.I had never seen any one so pale."
"“月亮升起时，我回到那个地方去寻找那座房子，可就是找不着。看到这种情况，我便知道那女人是谁了，还明白了她为什么要对我笑。","“When the moon rose I returned to the same place and sought for the house, but it was no longer there.When I saw that, I knew who the woman was, and wherefore she had smiled at me."
"“你真应该跟我一起去的。新月节那天，年轻的皇帝出宫到清真寺去祈祷。他的头发和胡须上染了玫瑰花瓣的颜色，他的脸颊上抹了一层细细的金粉。他的手掌和脚心被藏红花染成了橘黄色。","“Certainly thou shouldst have been with me.On the feast of the New Moon the young Emperor came forth from his palace and went into the mosque to pray.His hair and beard were dyed with rose-leaves, and his cheeks were powdered with a fine gold dust.The palms of his feet and hands were yellow with saffron."
"“日出时他身着银袍出宫，日落时他穿着金袍回宫。人们见到他后都跪在地上，并将脸埋了起来，但是我没有那样做。我站在一个卖枣子的货摊前，等待着。皇帝看见我时，扬起描过的眉毛，停了下来。我定定地站在那儿，并不向他跪拜。人们对我的胆大震惊不已，都劝我快从城中逃走。我不理睬他们，而是走到那些出售异教神像的贩子们中去，与他们坐在一起。这些人因出售异教神像而不讨人喜欢。当我把自己所做的一切告诉他们后，他们每人送给我一尊神像，并请求我离开他们。","“At sunrise he went forth from his palace in a robe of silver, and at sunset he returned to it again in a robe of gold.The people flung themselves on the ground and hid their faces, but I would not do so.I stood by the stall of a seller of dates and waited.When the Emperor saw me, he raised his painted eyebrows and stopped.I stood quite still, and made him no obeisance.The people marvelled at my boldness, and counselled me to flee from the city.I paid no heed to them, but went and sat with the sellers of strange gods, who by reason of their craft are abominated.When I told them what I had done, each of them gave me a god and prayed me to leave them."
"“当天晚上，我躺在石榴街茶馆里的一个垫子上，皇帝的卫兵走了进来，把我带到宫中。进去以后，他们关上我身后的每一扇门，还加上了锁链。里面有个大院子，四周环绕着一个拱廊。墙壁由白色的雪花石膏做成，处处贴着青蓝相间的瓷砖。柱子是绿色大理石做的，地上铺着一种桃花色的大理石。以前我从没有见过像那样的东西。","“That night, as I lay on a cushion in the tea-house that is in the Street of Pomegranates, the guards of the Emperor entered and led me to the palace.As I went in they closed each door behind me, and put a chain across it.Inside was a great court with an arcade running all round.The walls were of white alabaster, set here and there with blue and green tiles.The pillars were of green marble, and the pavement of a kind of peach-blossom marble.I had never seen anything like it before."
"“经过院子时，站在阳台上的两个戴面纱的女人看到了我，并诅咒我。护卫匆忙地走着，手中的长矛在光滑的地板上拖得咯吱响。他们打开一道精致的象牙门，我发现自己来到了一个有七个看台的水上花园里。园子里的郁金香含苞待放，还有月光花以及银光闪闪的芦荟。晶莹剔透的喷泉垂挂在微暗的半空中，像一根细长的水晶柱。柏树就像是燃烧殆尽的火把。一只夜莺在柏树上唱歌。","“As I passed across the court two veiled women looked down from a balcony and cursed me.The guards hastened on, and the butts of the lances rang upon the polished floor.They opened a gate of wrought ivory, and I found myself in a watered garden of seven terraces.It was planted with tulip-cups and moonflowers, and silver-studded aloes.Like a slim reed of crystal a fountain hung in the dusky air.The cypress-trees were like burnt-out torches.From one of them a nightingale was singing."
"“花园的尽头立着一个小亭子。我们走近亭子时，两位宦官出来迎接我们。他们大腹便便，走起路来摇摇晃晃；见到我时，用他们那黄色眼皮的眼睛充满好奇地打量我。其中一个把护卫队长拉到一旁，小声跟他说着什么。另一个做作地从一个淡紫色的椭圆形搪瓷盒子中取出香味糖锭，不停地嚼着。","“At the end of the garden stood a little pavilion.As we approached it two eunuchs came out to meet us.Their fat bodies swayed as they walked, and they glanced curiously at me with their yellow-lidded eyes.One of them drew aside the captain of the guard, and in a low voice whispered to him.The other kept munching scented pastilles, which he took with an affected gesture out of an oval box of lilac enamel."
"“过了一会儿，护卫队长把卫兵打发走。于是他们回宫，两位宦官慢慢地跟在后面，一边走一边采摘树上甜甜的桑葚吃。年长的宦官曾回过头来，不怀好意地朝我笑。","“After a few moments the captain of the guard dismissed the soldiers.They went back to the palace, the eunuchs following slowly behind and plucking the sweet mulberries from the trees as they passed.Once the elder of the two turned round, and smiled at me with an evil smile."
"“之后护卫队长示意我朝亭子的入口走。我毫不胆怯地继续走，拉开沉重的帘子，走了进去。","“Then the captain of the guard motioned me towards the entrance of the pavilion.I walked on without trembling, and drawing the heavy curtain aside I entered in."
"“年轻的皇帝躺在染了色的狮皮软榻上，一只白隼停歇在他的手腕上。他身后站着一个头戴铜帽的努比亚人，赤裸着上半身，两只穿了洞的耳朵上垂着一副沉甸甸的耳环。软榻旁边的桌子上放着一把锋利的钢制短弯刀。","“The young Emperor was stretched on a couch of dyed lion skins, and a gerfalcon perched upon his wrist.Behind him stood a brass-turbaned Nubian, naked down to the waist, and with heavy earrings in his split ears.On a table by the side of the couch lay a mighty scimitar of steel."
"“皇帝一看见我便皱起眉头，对我说：‘你叫什么名字？你不知道我就是这座城的皇帝吗？’可是我没有回答他。","“When the Emperor saw me he frowned, and said to me, ‘What is thy name?Knowest thou not that I am Emperor of this city?’But I made him no answer."
"“他用手指头指向那把弯刀，努比亚人立即抓起它，凶狠地朝我砍过来。刀刃飕飕地穿过我的身体，可我毫发未损。努比亚人却倒在地上，四脚朝天，爬起来后，他害怕得牙齿直打颤，躲到软榻后面去了。","“He pointed with his finger at the scimitar, and the Nubian seized it, and rushing forward struck at me with great violence.The blade whizzed through me, and did me no hurt.The man fell sprawling on the floor, and when he rose up his teeth chattered with terror and he hid himself behind the couch."
"“皇帝立即跳了起来，从武器架上抽出一根长矛，朝我扔了过来。我一把抓住飞过来的长矛，毫不费力地将矛杆折成了两段。他又用箭射我，但我一举起双手，箭就在半空中停住了。后来皇帝从白皮腰带中抽出一把短剑，刺入努比亚人的咽喉，唯恐他会讲出自己这些不体面的事情。努比亚人像条受了摧残的蛇一样痛苦地扭曲起来，嘴里冒出红沫。","“The Emperor leapt to his feet, and taking a lance from a stand of arms, he threw it at me.I caught it in its flight, and brake the shaft into two pieces.He shot at me with an arrow, but I held up my hands and it stopped in mid-air.Then he drew a dagger from a belt of white leather, and stabbed the Nubian in the throat lest the slave should tell of his dishonour.The man writhed like a trampled snake, and a red foam bubbled from his lips."
"“他一死，皇帝就转向我。他拿出一块镶了花边的紫色绸料小手绢，拭去额头上晶莹的汗珠，对我说：‘您是位我伤害不得的先知吗，抑或是先知的儿子，我同样伤害不得？我恳求您今晚就离开我的城市吧。只要您还在城中，我就不再是这里的主人了。’","“As soon as he was dead the Emperor turned to me, and when he had wiped away the bright sweat from his brow with a little napkin of purfled and purple silk, he said to me, ‘Art thou a prophet, that I may not harm thee, or the son of a prophet, that I can do thee no hurt?I pray thee leave my city to-night, for while thou art in it I am no longer its lord.’"
"“我回答说：‘我要把你的财产带走一半。把你的财富给我一半，我就会离开的。’","“And I answered him, ‘I will go for half of thy treasure.Give me half of thy treasure, and I will go away.’"
"“他拉着我的手，把我领进花园里。护卫队长再次看见我时吃了一惊。宦官们也看见了我，他们吓得膝盖直抖，纷纷惊恐地跪在地上。","“He took me by the hand, and led me out into the garden.When the captain of the guard saw me, he wondered.When the eunuchs saw me, their knees shook and they fell upon the ground in fear."
"“宫中有个房间，八面墙都是用红斑岩砌成的，黄铜吊顶上悬挂着一些灯。皇帝触摸一面墙，墙就开了。我们走进里面的一个通道，通道里点着好多火把。通道两旁的壁龛上放着很多巨大的酒缸，里面满满地装着银子。我们来到通道中央，皇帝说了句平日不说的话后，一道装有秘密弹簧的花岗岩大门一下子就弹开了。他用手挡住脸，生怕把眼睛给晃得昏花。","“There is a chamber in the palace that has eight walls of red porphyry, and a brass-sealed ceiling hung with lamps.The Emperor touched one of the walls and it opened, and we passed down a corridor that was lit with many torches.In niches upon each side stood great wine-jars filled to the brim with silver pieces.When we reached the centre of the corridor the Emperor spake the word that may not be spoken, and a granite door swung back on a secret spring, and he put his hands before his face lest his eyes should be dazzled."
"“你想象不出那是一个多么奇妙的地方。庞大的乌龟壳里装满了珍珠，巨型镂空月长石里堆满了红宝石。象皮箱里存着黄金，皮革瓶里盛满了金粉。还有放在水晶杯中的蛋白石和翡翠杯中的蓝宝石。薄薄的象牙碟子里整齐地摆放着圆溜溜的祖母绿。有一个角落里堆满了丝织袋子，一些袋子里装着绿松石，另一些袋子里装着绿玉石。象牙角杯里装满了紫水晶，黄铜角杯中盛满了玉髓和红玉髓。雪松做的梁柱上挂着一串串黄色山猫石。椭圆形盾牌的平整处镶嵌着红玉，有的是酒红色，有的是青绿色。然而我对你说的这些不过是那里的九牛一毛。","“Thou couldst not believe how marvellous a place it was.There were huge tortoise-shells full of pearls, and hollowed moonstones of great size piled up with red rubies.The gold was stored in coffers of elephant-hide, and the gold-dust in leather bottles.There were opals and sapphires, the former in cups of crystal, and the latter in cups of jade.Round green emeralds were ranged in order upon thin plates of ivory, and in one corner were silk bags filled, some with turquoise-stones, and others with beryls.The ivory horns were heaped with purple amethysts, and the horns of brass with chalcedonies and sards.The pillars, which were of cedar, were hung with strings of yellow lynx-stones.In the flat oval shields there were carbuncles, both wine-coloured and coloured like grass.And yet I have told thee but a tithe of what was there."
"“皇帝把手从脸上拿开后对我说：‘这就是我的藏宝屋，有一半的宝藏是您的了，正如我对您所承诺的那样。我还会送您骆驼和赶骆驼的人，他们会照您的吩咐把宝藏运到世界上您想要去的任何地方。这件事今天晚上就得办，我不愿让太阳——我的父亲，看见我的城里竟会有一个我杀不死的人。’","“And when the Emperor had taken away his hands from before his face he said to me: ‘This is my house of treasure, and half that is in it is thine, even as I promised to thee.And I will give thee camels and camel drivers, and they shall do thy bidding and take thy share of the treasure to whatever part of the world thou desirest to go.And the thing shall be done to-night, for I would not that the Sun, who is my father, should see that there is in my city a man whom I cannot slay.’"
"“不过我对他说：‘这里的黄金是你的，白银也是你的，珍贵的珠宝和值钱的东西全都是你的。至于我，我不需要这些东西。除了戴在你手指上的那枚小戒指，其他的我什么都不会带走。’","“But I answered him, ‘The gold that is here is thine, and the silver also is thine, and thine are the precious jewels and the things of price.As for me, I have no need of these.Nor shall I take aught from thee but that little ring that thou wearest on the finger of thy hand.’"
"“皇帝皱起了眉头。‘这不过是枚铅戒指，’他叫道，‘一文不值。您还是带上您那一半宝藏离开我的城吧。’","“And the Emperor frowned.‘It is but a ring of lead,’ he cried, ‘nor has it any value.Therefore take thy half of the treasure and go from my city.’"
"“‘不，’我说，‘我要定这枚铅戒指了，别的我什么都不要。因为我知道那里头写着什么，也知道它有什么用处。’","“‘Nay,’ I answered, ‘but I will take nought but that leaden ring, for I know what is written within it, and for what purpose.’"
"“皇帝颤抖起来，向我哀求着说：‘把我全部的财宝都拿去吧，离开我的城。连我的那一份财富也归您了。’","“And the Emperor trembled, and besought me and said,‘Take all the treasure and go from my city.The half that is mine shall be thine also.’"
"“于是我做了一件荒唐事，其实也算不上什么。我把那枚财富戒指藏在了一个山洞里，山洞离这儿只有一整天的路程。山洞离这儿也就一天的路程，它等着你前往呢。谁要是拥有了那枚戒指，谁就会比世界上所有的国王都富有。去吧，把它拿到手，全世界的财富就都归你了。”然而年轻的渔夫笑了。“爱情比财富更珍贵，”他大声喊道，“而且小美人鱼爱着我。”“不，没有什么比财富更珍贵。”灵魂说。","“And I did a strange thing, but what I did matters not, for in a cave that is but a day’s journey from this place have, I hidden the Ring of Riches.It is but a day’s journey from this place, and it waits for thy coming.He who has this Ring is richer than all the kings of the world.Come therefore and take it, and the world’s riches shall be thine.” But the young Fisherman laughed.“Love is better than Riches,” he cried, “and the little Mermaid loves me.” “Nay, but there is nothing better than Riches,” said the Soul."
"“爱情更珍贵。”年轻的渔夫说完就又一头扎进深海里去了。灵魂只好再次哭泣着穿过沼泽离开了。","“Love is better,” answered the young Fisherman, and he plunged into the deep, and the Soul went weeping away over the marshes."
"第三年过去了，灵魂来到海滩，呼唤年轻的渔夫。渔夫从海底浮出来，问道：“你唤我干什么呢？”灵魂回答说：“靠近一点儿，我好与你说话，我见识了好多奇妙的事情。”于是渔夫靠近了一点儿，躺在浅滩上，用手托着头，倾听着。","And after the third year was over, the Soul came down to the shore of the sea, and called to the young Fisherman, and he rose out of the deep and said, “Why dost thou call to me?” And the Soul answered, “Come nearer, that I may speak with thee, for I have seen marvellous things.” So he came nearer, and couched in the shallow water, and leaned his head upon his hand and listened."
"灵魂开口说：“我经过一座城市，那里有一家坐落在河边的小旅店。我跟水手们坐在那儿，他们喝两种颜色混合的葡萄酒，吃大麦做的面包，另外还蘸上醋吃月桂叶包着的小咸鱼。我们坐在那儿逗乐时，一个上了年纪的人走了进来。他肩上披着一张皮制的毯子，手里拿着一把有两个琥珀角的鲁特琴。他把毯子铺在地板上，用一根羽茎拨响他的琴，这时一个蒙着面纱的少女跑了进来，并在我们面前跳起舞来。她的脸蒙上了一层薄薄的面纱，两脚是光着的。赤脚的她在毯子上跳来跳去，像只小白鸽。我从来没有见过那么曼妙的舞姿。而且，她翩翩起舞的城市离这儿不过一天的行程。”年轻的渔夫听到灵魂的这番话后，想起了小美人鱼，她没有脚，也不能跳舞。于是他萌发了一种强烈的欲望。他自言自语道：“只不过一天的路程，过后我还可以回到我爱人的身边。”他笑了，从浅滩上站起来，大步朝岸上走去。","And the Soul said to him, “In a city that I know of there is an inn that standeth by a river.I sat there with sailors who drank of two different-coloured wines, and ate bread made of barley, and little salt fish served in bay leaves with vinegar.And as we sat and made merry, there entered to us an old man bearing a leathern carpet and a lute that had two horns of amber.And when he had laid out the carpet on the floor, he struck with a quill on the wire strings of his lute, and a girl whose face was veiled ran in and began to dance before us.Her face was veiled with a veil of gauze, but her feet were naked.Naked were her feet, and they moved over the carpet like little white pigeons.Never have I seen anything so marvellous; and the city in which she dances is but a day’s journey from this place.” Now when the young Fisherman heard the words of his Soul, he remembered that the little Mermaid had no feet and could not dance.And a great desire came over him, and he said to himself, “It is but a day’s journey, and I can return to my love,” and he laughed, and stood up in the shallow water, and strode towards the shore."
"来到干燥的岸上后，他又一次笑了，并热情地向灵魂伸出双臂。于是他的灵魂狂喜地大叫一声就朝他奔了过去，进入他的体内。这时年轻的渔夫便看见他的影子在面前的沙地上伸展开来，那就是他的灵魂。","And when he had reached the dry shore he laughed again, and held out his arms to his Soul.And his Soul gave a great cry of joy and ran to meet him, and entered into him, and the young Fisherman saw stretched before him upon the sand that shadow of the body that is the body of the Soul."
"他的灵魂对他说：“我们不要耽误了，立即出发吧。海神会嫉妒，而且还有好多怪物听从他们的吩咐。”","And his Soul said to him, “Let us not tarry, but get hence at once, for the Sea-gods are jealous, and have monsters that do their bidding.” "
"于是他们就匆匆上路了，走了一天一夜，终于在第二天晚上来到了一座城市。","So they made haste, and all that night they journeyed beneath the moon, and all the next day they journeyed beneath the sun, and on the evening of the day they came to a city."
"年轻的渔夫问他的灵魂：“这就是你对我说过的有位舞女的城市吗？”他的灵魂回答说：“不是这座城市，是另外一座。不过我们可以进去看看。”于是他们进了城，穿过一些街道。路过珠宝街的时候，年轻的渔夫看见有个货摊上放着一只美丽的银杯子。他的灵魂对他说：“把那个银杯子拿走，藏起来。”渔夫便拿起那只银杯子，把它藏在外衣的褶缝里。之后他们便匆匆出城了。","And the young Fisherman said to his Soul, “Is this the city in which she dances of whom thou didst speak to me?” And his Soul answered him, “It is not this city, but another.Nevertheless let us enter in.”So they entered in and passed through the streets, and as they passed through the Street of the Jewellers the young Fisherman saw a fair silver cup set forth in a booth.And his Soul said to him, “Take that silver cup and hide it.” So he took the cup and hid it in the fold of his tunic, and they went hurriedly out of the city."
"离开城走了一里格后，年轻的渔夫皱起眉头，扔掉银杯子，气愤地问他的灵魂：“你为什么要叫我偷银杯子并且藏起来，这多不道德啊？”然而他的灵魂回答他说：“冷静，冷静。”第二天晚上，他们又来到一个城市，年轻的渔夫又问他的灵魂：“这就是你对我说过的有位舞女的城市吗？”他的灵魂回答他说：“不是这座城市，是另外一座。不过我们还是进去看看吧。”他们便进了城，在街上闲逛。走到便鞋街时，年轻的渔夫看见有个小孩站在一口水缸边。他的灵魂对他说：“去揍那个孩子。”于是渔夫动手去打小孩，直到把他打哭了才罢休。之后他们又匆匆地离开了那个城市。","And after that they had gone a league from the city, the young Fisherman frowned, and flung the cup away, and said to his Soul, “Why didst thou tell me to take this cup and hide it, for it was an evil thing to do?” But his Soul answered him, “Be at peace, be at peace.” And on the evening of the second day they came to a city, and the young Fisherman said to his Soul, “Is this the city in which she dances of whom thou didst speak to me?” And his Soul answered him, “It is not this city, but another.Nevertheless let us enter in.”So they entered in and passed through the streets, and as they passed through the Street of the Sellers of Sandals, the young Fisherman saw a child standing by a jar of water.And his Soul said to him, “Smite that child.”So he smote the child till it wept, and when he had done this they went hurriedly out of the city."
"离开城市走了一里格后，年轻的渔夫突然生起气来，质问他的灵魂：“你为什么叫我打那个小孩？做这件坏事？”然而他的灵魂又回答他说：“冷静，冷静。”第三天晚上，他们又来到一座城市，年轻的渔夫对他的灵魂说：“这就是你对我说过的有那位舞女的城市吗？”他的灵魂回答说：“或许就是这座城市吧，我们进去看看就知道。”他们便进了城，穿过好几条街。不过年轻的渔夫既没有看到一条河，也没看到那个位于河边的小旅店。城里的人都好奇地望着他，他开始害怕起来，对他的灵魂说：“我们还是走吧，这儿没有长着白皙的脚、会跳舞的人。”但他的灵魂回答说：“不，我们还是留下来吧。夜里太黑，路上会遇到强盗的。”他便在集市上找了个地方坐下歇息。过了一会儿，有个戴头巾的商人走了过来，他身披一件鞑靼人的斗篷，提着一个牛角灯笼，灯笼吊在一根有节的芦苇杆上。商人对他说：“这会儿都收摊了，货物也打包了，你怎么还坐在集市上呢？”年轻的渔夫回答说：“我在城里找不到旅店住宿，又没有亲戚可以留我过夜。”“你我不就是亲戚吗？”商人说，“我们不都是由同一个上帝创造出来的吗？跟我走吧，我有一间客房。”于是年轻的渔夫站起来，跟着商人去了他家。等他穿过一个石榴园来到商人家中时，商人用铜盘盛上玫瑰花水，让他洗手；送来熟透的甜瓜，让他解渴；还端上一碗米饭和一块烤羊羔肉，放在他面前。","And after that they had gone a league from the city the young Fisherman grew wroth, and said to his Soul, “Why didst thou tell me to smite the child, for it was an evil thing to do?” But his Soul answered him, “Be at peace, be at peace.” And on the evening of the third day they came to a city, and the young Fisherman said to his Soul, “Is this the city in which she dances of whom thou didst speak to me?” And his Soul answered him, “It may be that it is in this city, therefore let us enter in.” So they entered in and passed through the streets, but nowhere could the young Fisherman find the river or the inn that stood by its side.And the people of the city looked curiously at him, and he grew afraid and said to his Soul, “Let us go hence, for she who dances with white feet is not here.” But his Soul answered, “Nay, but let us tarry, for the night is dark and there will be robbers on the way.” So he sat him down in the market-place and rested, and after a time there went by a hooded merchant who had a cloak of cloth of Tartary, and bare a lantern of pierced horn at the end of a jointed reed.And the merchant said to him, “Why dost thou sit in the market-place, seeing that the booths are closed and the bales corded?” And the young Fisherman answered him, “I can find no inn in this city, nor have I any kinsman who might give me shelter.” “Are we not all kinsmen?” said the merchant.“And did not one God make us?Therefore come with me, for I have a guest-chamber.” So the young Fisherman rose up and followed the merchant to his house.And when he had passed through a garden of pomegranates and entered into the house, the merchant brought him rose-water in a copper dish that he might wash his hands, and ripe melons that he might quench his thirst, and set a bowl of rice and a piece of roasted kid before him."
"等渔夫吃喝完毕之后，商人就领他来到客房，并叮嘱他好好休息。年轻的渔夫谢过商人，吻了他手指上戴的戒指，随后就躺在染了色的山羊毛毯上休息。他用一张黑色的羊羔毛被盖好身体后，就呼呼地入睡了。","And after that he had finished, the merchant led him to the guest-chamber, and bade him sleep and be at rest.And the young Fisherman gave him thanks, and kissed the ring that was on his hand, and flung himself down on the carpets of dyed goat’s-hair.And when he had covered himself with a covering of black lamb’s-wool he fell asleep."
"离天亮还有三个时辰，天还是黑漆漆的，渔夫的灵魂唤醒他，对他说：“快起来，到商人的屋子去，就是他睡觉的那间，把他杀死，拿走他的金子，我们急需金子。”于是年轻的渔夫起床，蹑手蹑脚地走到商人的房间。商人的脚旁放着一柄弯刀，他身边的一个托盘里有九个钱袋，里面装的是黄金。渔夫伸出手去拿那把弯刀。就在他的手刚刚碰到刀子时商人一下子惊醒了，他一跃而起，迅速抓住了弯刀，朝着年轻的渔夫大声吼道：“难道你要恩将仇报吗？你要用流淌的鲜血来报答我对你的善举吗？”这时灵魂命令年轻的渔夫：“打他。”随后他就把商人给打晕了，然后抓起九袋金子，穿过石榴园朝启明星的方向匆匆逃走了。","And three hours before dawn, and while it was still night, his Soul waked him and said to him, “Rise up and go to the room of the merchant, even to the room in which he sleepeth, and slay him, and take from him his gold, for we have need of it.” And the young Fisherman rose up and crept towards the room of the merchant, and over the feet of the merchant there was lying a curved sword, and the tray by the side of the merchant held nine purses of gold.And he reached out his hand and touched the sword, and when he touched it the merchant started and awoke, and leaping up seized himself the sword and cried to the young Fisherman, “Dost thou return evil for good, and pay with the shedding of blood for the kindness that I have shown thee?” And his Soul said to the young Fisherman, “Strike him,” and he struck him so that he swooned and he seized then the nine purses of gold, and fled hastily through the garden of pomegranates, and set his face to the star that is the star of morning."
"离开城市一里格后，年轻的渔夫捶胸顿足，对他的灵魂说：“你为什么怂恿我杀了商人，还抢走了他的黄金？你就是个魔鬼。”而他的灵魂说：“冷静，冷静。”“不，”年轻的渔夫大喊道，“我冷静不了，我恨自己做了那些你怂恿我干的事情。我也恨你。你告诉我为何叫我做那些可恶的事。”他的灵魂回答说：“当初你把我打发到世界各地流浪时，你并不肯让我带走你的心。我于是学会了干这些事，并且乐此不疲。”“你在说什么啊？”年轻的渔夫喃喃地说。","And when they had gone a league from the city, the young Fisherman beat his breast, and said to his Soul, “Why didst thou bid me slay the merchant and take his gold?Surely thou art evil.” But his Soul answered him, “Be at peace, be at peace.” “Nay,” cried the young Fisherman, “I may not be at peace, for all that thou hast made me to do I hate.Thee also I hate, and I bid thee tell me wherefore thou hast wrought with me in this wise.” And his Soul answered him, “When thou didst send me forth into the world thou gavest me no heart, so I learned to do all these things and love them.” “What sayest thou?” murmured the young Fisherman."
"“你自己知道，”他的灵魂说，“你知道得很清楚。难道你不记得曾经你不让我带走你的心？我才不信你这么快就忘了。不要自寻烦恼了，也不要为我担心；放心吧，世上既没有除不去的痛苦，也没有享受不到的快乐。”年轻的渔夫听了这些话后，浑身颤抖起来，对他的灵魂说：“不，你这个可恶的魔鬼，你不光使我忘记了我的爱人，还用各种各样的诱惑来引诱我，使我走上了罪恶的道路。”他的灵魂说：“你应该还记得吧，当初你打发我满世界流浪时，你并不肯让你的心陪着我。走吧，让我们到另一座城市去吧，去寻找乐子，我们已经有了九袋黄金。”可是年轻的渔夫拿起那九袋黄金扔在了地上，并用脚猛踩。","“Thou knowest,” answered his Soul, “thou knowest it well.Hast thou forgotten that thou gavest me no heart?I trow not.And so trouble not thyself nor me, but be at peace, for there is no pain that thou shalt not give away, nor any pleasure that thou shalt not receive.” And when the young Fisherman heard these words he trembled and said to his Soul, “Nay, but thou art evil, and hast made me forget my love, and hast tempted me with temptations, and hast set my feet in the ways of sin.” And his Soul answered him, “Thou hast not forgotten that when thou didst send me forth into the world thou gavest me no heart.Come, let us go to another city, and make merry, for we have nine purses of gold.” But the young Fisherman took the nine purses of gold, and flung them down, and trampled on them."
"“不，”他吼道，“现在你我之间没有任何关系了，我再也不会跟你去任何地方了。就跟我以前打发你走那样，现在我也要用同样的方式赶你走，因为你唆使我干坏事。”说完他转身背对着月亮，抽出那把绿蛇皮刀柄的小刀，准备把自己身体的影子，也就是他的灵魂之躯，从他脚下砍掉。","“Nay,” he cried, “but I will have nought to do with thee, nor will I journey with thee anywhere, but even as I sent thee away before, so will I send thee away now, for thou hast wrought me no good.”And he turned his back to the moon, and with the little knife that had the handle of green viper’s skin he strove to cut from his feet that shadow of the body which is the body of the Soul."
"然而他的灵魂一动不动，对他的命令无动于衷，相反还对他说：“那个女巫教你的符咒已经失效了，我不可能再离开你，你也不可能再把我赶走。一个人一生中只有一次机会打发走他的灵魂。一旦他把自己的灵魂收回来，就得永远地留住它，这既是对他的惩罚，也是对他的恩赐。”年轻的渔夫脸色变得苍白，他握紧拳头，大声叫着：“她当初没有告诉我这些，她是个骗子。”“不，”他的灵魂回答说，“不过是因为她对自己崇拜的那个他太忠诚，她要永远做他的仆人。”当年轻的渔夫明白了他非但没法摆脱他的灵魂，反而要与这样一个邪恶的灵魂共处时，他一下子扑倒在地，伤心地哭了起来。","Yet his Soul stirred not from him, nor paid heed to his command, but said to him, “The spell that the Witch told thee avails thee no more, for I may not leave thee, nor mayest thou drive me forth.Once in his life may a man send his Soul away, but he who receiveth back his Soul must keep it with him for ever, and this is his punishment and his reward.” And the young Fisherman grew pale and clenched his hands and cried, “She was a false Witch in that she told me not that.” “Nay,” answered his Soul, “but she was true to Him she worships, and whose servant she will be ever.” And when the young Fisherman knew that he could no longer get rid of his Soul, and that it was an evil Soul and would abide with him always, he fell upon the ground weeping bitterly."
"天亮了，年轻的渔夫站起身，对他的灵魂说：“我要绑住双手，免得我还会照你的吩咐做坏事；我要闭紧嘴巴，免得我说出你要说的话；我还要回到我爱人住的地方。我要回到海里去，回到她过去经常唱歌的那个小海湾去；我要唤她上来，告诉她我做过的坏事以及你对我做过的坏事。”他的灵魂又诱惑他，问他：“谁是你的爱人，让你非回到她那儿去不可？世上比她美的人多着呢。撒马利亚的舞女们会各种飞禽走兽的舞姿。她们用指甲花把脚染了色，手中握着好多小铜铃。她们一边跳一边笑，笑声悦耳，仿佛山涧的淙淙流水。跟我走，我带你去见见她们。你干嘛要念念不忘那些罪恶的事情呢？难道那些美味可口的东西不是做来给人吃的吗？难道喝甘甜的东西，里面下了毒药不成？不要自寻烦恼了，跟我到另一个城市去吧。那儿有座小城，附近有个郁金香花园。美丽的花园中住着白孔雀和蓝胸脯孔雀。孔雀面朝太阳开屏时，雀尾看起来就像象牙圆盘和镀金圆盘。饲养孔雀的女孩为孔雀跳舞，让它们快乐。她时而手舞，时而足蹈。她的眼睛涂了一层锑粉，鼻孔像燕子的翅膀。其中一个鼻孔上面戴着一个珍珠刻成的花形鼻环。她一边跳舞一边欢快地笑着，踝骨上的银环发出银铃般的声响。不要自己跟自己过不去，跟我到那座城市去看看吧。然而年轻的渔夫并没有理会他的灵魂，而是用沉默封条紧紧地封住自己的嘴，用绳子死死地绑住自己的手，动身往回走。他要回到他离开的地方，回到他的爱人过去常常唱歌的那个小海湾。尽管灵魂一路上不停地引诱他，可是他从未动心，更别提去做灵魂唆使他做的任何坏事。他内心里那股爱情的力量太强大了。","And when it was day the young Fisherman rose up and said to his Soul, “I will bind my hands that I may not do thy bidding, and close my lips that I may not speak thy words, and I will return to the place where she whom I love has her dwelling.Even to the sea will I return, and to the little bay where she is wont to sing, and I will call to her and tell her the evil I have done and the evil thou hast wrought on me.” And his Soul tempted him and said, “Who is thy love, that thou shouldst return to her?The world has many fairer than she is.There are the dancing-girls of Samaris who dance in the manner of all kinds of birds and beasts.Their feet are painted with henna, and in their hands they have little copper bells.They laugh while they dance, and their laughter is as clear as the laughter of water.Come with me and I will show them to thee.For what is this trouble of thine about the things of sin?Is that which is pleasant to eat not made for the eater?Is there poison in that which is sweet to drink?Trouble not thyself, but come with me to another city.There is a little city hard by in which there is a garden of tulip-trees.And there dwell in this comely garden white peacocks and peacocks that have blue breasts.Their tails when they spread them to the sun are like disks of ivory and like gilt disks.And she who feeds them dances for their pleasure, and sometimes she dances on her hands and at other times she dances with her feet.Her eyes are coloured with stibium, and her nostrils are shaped like the wings of a swallow.From a hook in one of her nostrils hangs a flower that is carved out of a pearl.She laughs while she dances, and the silver rings that are about her ankles tinkle like bells of silver.And so trouble not thyself any more, but come with me to this city.” But the young Fisherman answered not his Soul, but closed his lips with the seal of silence and with a tight cord bound his hands, and journeyed back to the place from which he had come, even to the little bay where his love had been wont to sing.And ever did his Soul tempt him by the way, but he made it no answer, nor would he do any of the wickedness that it sought to make him to do, so great was the power of the love that was within him."
"等他来到了大海边，他才把手上的绳子解开，将沉默封条从嘴上撕去，呼唤小美人鱼。他呼唤了整整一天，恳求她，却始终不见小美人鱼。","And when he had reached the shore of the sea, he loosed the cord from his hands, and took the seal of silence from his lips, and called to the little Mermaid.But she came not to his call, though he called to her all day long and besought her."
"他的灵魂嘲笑他说：“你一定是没有从你的爱人那儿得到多少欢乐。你就像一个在渴死之前往漏器皿中倒水的人。你付出了一切，却得不到丝毫回报。你还是跟着我好，因为我知道欢乐谷在什么地方，知道那儿有什么。”年轻的渔夫仍旧没有理会他的灵魂。他用树枝在岩石的缺口处围了一个房子，在那儿一住就是一年。每个清晨、每个午后、每个深夜，他都深情地呼唤着美人鱼。然而她再也没有从海中出来与他相会，他到处都找不到她。洞穴中、碧水下、海潮的漩涡里、海底深处的井中，他都去寻找过，但始终不见她的影子。","And his Soul mocked him and said, “Surely thou hast but little joy out of thy love.Thou art as one who in time of death pours water into a broken vessel.Thou givest away what thou hast, and nought is given to thee in return.It were better for thee to come with me, for I know where the Valley of Pleasure lies, and what things are wrought there.” But the young Fisherman answered not his Soul, but in a cleft of the rock he built himself a house of wattles, and abode there for the space of a year.And every morning he called to the Mermaid, and every noon he called to her again, and at night-time he spake her name.Yet never did she rise out of the sea to meet him, nor in any place of the sea could he find her though he sought for her in the caves and in the green water, in the pools of the tide and in the wells that are at the bottom of the deep."
"他的灵魂仍善罢甘休，继续用邪恶引诱他，还低声对他讲那些可怕的事情。但这些都没能动摇他，他那股爱情的力量实在是太强大了。","And ever did his Soul tempt him with evil, and whisper of terrible things.Yet did it not prevail against him, so great was the power of his love."
"一年过去了，灵魂在他的体内暗想：“我已经用邪恶引诱了我的主人，可是他爱的力量比我的力量强大。现在我要用善来引诱他，说不定他会听我的。”于是他对年轻的渔夫说：“我告诉过你世间的欢乐，而你置若罔闻。现在我只好告诉你世间的痛苦了，这也许是你想听的。说实话，痛苦主宰着这个世界，没有一个人能从他的网中逃逸。有人缺少衣服，有人缺少食物。守寡的既有贵妇，也有贫苦的女人。麻风病人在沼泽地上来来往往，他们还彼此相残。乞丐在公路上走来走去，他们的口袋空空如也。饥荒游荡在各个城市的街道上，瘟疫伺机在各家门口。走吧，让我们前去改善这些状况，不让它们再发生。你看你的爱人都不回应你的呼唤，你为什么还要逗留在这儿呼唤她呢？爱到底是什么，你竟把它看得如此珍重？”年轻的渔夫仍旧不语，他那股爱情的力量太强大了。每个清晨、每个午后、每个深夜，他都深情地呼唤着她的名字。可是她从没有从海里出来与他相会，他到处都没找到她。入海口的河流里、波浪下的溪谷里，甚至在被黑夜染成紫色的海洋上，在被黎明抹成灰色的海洋中，他都去寻找过，但始终不见她的影子。","And after the year was over, the Soul thought within himself, “I have tempted my master with evil, and his love is stronger than I am.I will tempt him now with good, and it may be that he will come with me.” So he spake to the young Fisherman and said, “I have told thee of the joy of the world, and thou hast turned a deaf ear to me.Suffer me now to tell thee of the world’s pain, and it may be that thou wilt hearken.For of a truth pain is the Lord of this world, nor is there any one who escapes from its net.There be some who lack raiment, and others who lack bread.There be widows who sit in purple, and widows who sit in rags.To and fro over the fens go the lepers, and they are cruel to each other.The beggars go up and down on the highways, and their wallets are empty.Through the streets of the cities walks Famine, and the Plague sits at their gates.Come, let us go forth and mend these things, and make them not to be.Wherefore shouldst thou tarry here calling to thy love, seeing she comes not to thy call?And what is love, that thou shouldst set this high store upon it?” But the young Fisherman answered it nought, so great was the power of his love.And every morning he called to the Mermaid, and every noon he called to her again, and at night-time he spake her name.Yet never did she rise out of the sea to meet him, nor in any place of the sea could he find her, though he sought for her in the rivers of the sea, and in the valleys that are under the waves, in the sea that the night makes purple, and in the sea that the dawn leaves grey."
"第二年过去了，一天晚上，年轻的渔夫孤零零地坐在篱笆围屋里，灵魂对他说：“瞧！我用恶引诱过你，又用善引诱过你，而你爱的力量比我的力量强大。因此，我不会再引诱你了。不过我恳求你让我回到你的心中，这样我就会跟从前一样，与你合为一体了。”“你当然可以回来了，”年轻的渔夫说，“在没有心的陪伴而独自流浪世界的那些日子里，你一定吃了不少苦头。”“哎呀！”他的灵魂叫了起来，“我找不到一个空隙可以让我钻进去，你的这颗心被爱填得严严实实的。”“我倒希望我能够帮助你，”年轻的渔夫说。","And after the second year was over, the Soul said to the young Fisherman at night-time, and as he sat in the wattled house alone, “Lo! now I have tempted thee with evil, and I have tempted thee with good, and thy love is stronger than I am.Wherefore will I tempt thee no longer, but I pray thee to suffer me to enter thy heart, that I may be one with thee even as before.” “Surely thou mayest enter,” said the young Fisherman, “for in the days when with no heart thou didst go through the world thou must have much suffered.” “Alas!” cried his Soul, “I can find no place of entrance, so compassed about with love is this heart of thine.” “Yet I would that I could help thee,” said the young Fisherman."
"他正说着，海洋中传来了好大一声哀号，像美人鱼家族中有人死时人们听到的那种哭声。年轻的渔夫跳起来，冲出围篱的房子，朝海滩跑去。黑色的波涛急匆匆地朝岸边扑过来，卷来一个比银子更白的东西。它白得如浪花一般，并像朵鲜花一样随波涛颠簸起伏。浪头把它从波涛中抢走，海沫又把它从浪头那里夺去，最后海岸接受了它。年轻的渔夫看见小美人鱼的尸体就躺在他的脚下。她躺在他的脚下，死了。","And as he spake there came a great cry of mourning from the sea, even the cry that men hear when one of the Sea-folk is dead.And the young Fisherman leapt up, and left his wattled house, and ran down to the shore.And the black waves came hurrying to the shore, bearing with them a burden that was whiter than silver.White as the surf it was, and like a flower it tossed on the waves.And the surf took it from the waves, and the foam took it from the surf, and the shore received it, and lying at his feet the young Fisherman saw the body of the little Mermaid.Dead at his feet it was lying."
"年轻的渔夫深受重创，悲恸而泣；他扑倒在小美人鱼的身边，热烈地吻着她那冰冷的红嘴唇，深情地抚弄着她头发上的湿琥珀。他扑倒在沙滩上，在她身旁哭得像一个乐极生悲的人。他用褐色的双臂把她紧紧地拥入怀里。她的嘴唇冰冷，但他仍然亲吻着。她发间的海盐就是蜜，虽然苦咸，可他吻着时仍觉得很幸福。他吻着她那合上的眼睑，他的眼泪比她双眼上洒落的浪花还要咸。","Weeping as one smitten with pain he flung himself down beside it, and he kissed the cold red of the mouth, and toyed with the wet amber of the hair.He flung himself down beside it on the sand, weeping as one trembling with joy, and in his brown arms he held it to his breast.Cold were the lips, yet he kissed them.Salt was the honey of the hair, yet he tasted it with a bitter joy.He kissed the closed eyelids, and the wild spray that lay upon their cups was less salt than his tears."
"年轻的渔夫对着美人鱼的尸体忏悔起来。他贴着她贝壳似的耳朵，向她倾诉自己的苦难经历。他把她的两只小手搭在自己的颈上，并用手抚摸着她那细芦苇般纤长的脖子。此时他的悲痛和幸福相互交织，痛苦中溢满了莫名的幸福。","And to the dead thing he made confession.Into the shells of its ears he poured the harsh wine of his tale.He put the little hands round his neck, and with his fingers he touched the thin reed of the throat.Bitter, bitter was his joy, and full of strange gladness was his pain."
"黑色的波涛愈来愈近，白色的浪花像麻风病人一样哀叫着。海上白色的浪花一浪接一浪地冲击海岸。海王的宫廷中又传来了哀号，遥远的大海上特赖登吹响号角，声音听起来很嘶哑。","The black sea came nearer, and the white foam moaned like a leper.With white claws of foam the sea grabbled at the shore.From the palace of the Sea-King came the cry of mourning again, and far out upon the sea the great Tritons blew hoarsely upon their horns."
"“快逃走吧，”他的灵魂催促他说，“海水越来越近了，如果你还呆着不走的话，海水会吞没你的。快逃走吧。我好害怕，我知道你的心对我紧闭着，原因是你的爱太强烈了。快逃到一个安全的地方吧。你不会不让我带上一颗心，就打发我到另一个世界去吧？”可是年轻的渔夫始终不理会他的灵魂，只是不停地呼唤着小美人鱼，并说道：“爱情，比智慧更美妙，比财富更珍贵，比人类女儿的双足更美好。”烈火摧毁不了它，海水也淹没不了它。黎明时我呼唤过你，可你没有回答我。连月亮都听见了我呼唤你的名字，可你还是不理睬我。离开你是我的错，我这一走反而害了我自己。但你的爱始终伴随着我，而且永远都是强大的，没有什么可以削弱它，不论我面对的是恶还是善。既然现在你已经死了，我也跟你一起去死。”他的灵魂再次恳求他离开，可是他不肯，他的爱太深沉了。海水越来越近，汹涌的波涛几乎要淹没他了。此刻他知道自己死期已近，便疯狂地吻着美人鱼冰冷的嘴唇。他的那颗心破碎了。就在渔夫那颗满怀爱意的心因过度悲恸而破碎时，灵魂趁机找到一个入口就进去了，就像从前那样与他融为一体。波涛终于淹没了年轻的渔夫。","“Flee away,” said his Soul, “for ever doth the sea come nigher, and if thou tarriest it will slay thee.Flee away, for I am afraid, seeing that thy heart is closed against me by reason of the greatness of thy love.Flee away to a place of safety.Surely thou wilt not send me without a heart into another world?” But the young Fisherman listened not to his Soul, but called on the little Mermaid and said, “Love is better than wisdom, and more precious than riches, and fairer than the feet of the daughters of men.The fires cannot destroy it, nor can the waters quench it.I called on thee at dawn, and thou didst not come to my call.The moon heard thy name, yet hadst thou no heed of me.For evilly had I left thee, and to my own hurt had I wandered away.Yet ever did thy love abide with me, and ever was it strong, nor did aught prevail against it, though I have looked upon evil and looked upon good.And now that thou art dead, surely I will die with thee also.” And his Soul besought him to depart, but he would not, so great was his love.And the sea came nearer, and sought to cover him with its waves, and when he knew that the end was at hand he kissed with mad lips the cold lips of the Mermaid, and the heart that was within him brake.And as through the fulness of his love his heart did break, the Soul found an entrance and entered in, and was one with him even as before.And the sea covered the young Fisherman with its waves."
"第二天早晨，神父去给大海祈福，因为海水闹腾得太厉害了。与神父一起去的有修道士、乐手，以及手持蜡烛的人、摇着香炉的人，还有好大一群人陪同。","And in the morning the Priest went forth to bless the sea, for it had been troubled.And with him went the monks and the musicians, and the candle-bearers, and the swingers of censers, and a great company."
"神父来到海滩上时，见到年轻的渔夫溺死在浪花里，怀里还紧紧地抱着小美人鱼的尸体。他紧皱眉头，往后退了一些，在胸前划了个十字，大声说：“我不会为大海和海里面的任何东西祈福。美人鱼家族该受到诅咒，那些与他们来往的人也该受到诅咒。至于他呢，他为爱情而抛弃上帝，因而受到上帝惩罚，死在他的情人身边。抬走他和他情人的尸体，把他们埋在漂洗场的角落里，上面不做任何标志，也不要做任何记号，这样就不会有人知道他们被埋在什么地方。他们生前受诅咒，死后也该受诅咒。”于是人们按照神父的吩咐在漂洗场选了一块不长香草的角落，挖了个深坑，把渔夫和美人鱼的尸体埋了。","And when the Priest reached the shore he saw the young Fisherman lying drowned in the surf, and clasped in his arms was the body of the little Mermaid.And he drew back frowning, and having made the sign of the cross, he cried aloud and said, “I will not bless the sea nor anything that is in it.Accursed be the Sea-folk, and accursed be all they who traffic with them.And as for him who for love’s sake forsook God, and so lieth here with his leman slain by God’s judgment, take up his body and the body of his leman, and bury them in the corner of the Field of the Fullers, and set no mark above them, nor sign of any kind, that none may know the place of their resting.For accursed were they in their lives, and accursed shall they be in their deaths also.” And the people did as he commanded them, and in the corner of the Field of the Fullers, where no sweet herbs grew, they dug a deep pit, and laid the dead things within it."
"第三年过去了，在一个宗教节日里，神父来到礼拜堂上，他要给人们展示上帝的伤痕，还要给人们讲上帝的愤怒。","And when the third year was over, and on a day that was a holy day, the Priest went up to the chapel, that he might show to the people the wounds of the Lord, and speak to them about the wrath of God."
"穿好法衣后他就进了礼拜堂，并在圣坛前行礼。他发现圣坛上铺满了他以前从未见过的奇异的鲜花。这些花看上去不同寻常，却又异常美丽。它们的美叫他心神不定，它们芳香扑鼻。他觉得心情很舒畅，却说不出为什么。","And when he had robed himself with his robes, and entered in and bowed himself before the altar, he saw that the altar was covered with strange flowers that never had been seen before.Strange were they to look at, and of curious beauty, and their beauty troubled him, and their odour was sweet in his nostrils.And he felt glad, and understood not why he was glad."
"随后他打开圣体龛，里面是香薰过的圣体匣，盛放着美丽的圣饼。神父把圣饼展示给人们看，然后又把它层层包起来。他开始对人们说话，打算向人们讲述上帝的愤怒。但是那些白色的花是那么美，闻起来是那么香，这些都使神父心烦意乱。一句意想不到的话脱口而出，他讲述的不是上帝的愤怒，而是上帝的爱。他自己也不知道他为什么要这么说。","And after that he had opened the tabernacle, and incensed the monstrance that was in it, and shown the fair wafer to the people, and hid it again behind the veil of veils, he began to speak to the people, desiring to speak to them of the wrath of God.But the beauty of the white flowers troubled him, and their odour was sweet in his nostrils, and there came another word into his lips, and he spake not of the wrath of God, but of the God whose name is Love.And why he so spake, he knew not."
"神父讲完后，人们都感动得哭了；他回到圣器收藏室，眼里也噙满泪水。执事们走了进来，为他脱去长袍，解下白麻布圣职衣、腰带、弥撒带和圣带。他站在那儿，神情恍惚，仿佛还在梦中。","And when he had finished his word the people wept, and the Priest went back to the sacristy, and his eyes were full of tears.And the deacons came in and began to unrobe him, and took from him the alb and the girdle, the maniple and the stole.And he stood as one in a dream."
"等他们做完这些事后，他望着他们，问道：“圣坛上放的是什么花，哪儿来的？”他们答道：“我们也说不准是些什么花，不过它们是从漂洗场采摘来的。”神父听了浑身发抖，他回到自己的住处，开始祈祷起来。","And after that they had unrobed him, he looked at them and said, “What are the flowers that stand on the altar, and whence do they come?” And they answered him, “What flowers they are we cannot tell, but they come from the corner of the Fullers’ Field.”And the Priest trembled, and returned to his own house and prayed."
"早上，天刚蒙蒙亮，他就同修道士、乐师、手持蜡烛的人、摇香炉的人，以及一大群人来到大海边，为大海祈福，也为海中一切野生生物祈福。他还为农牧神祈福，甚至连那些在森林中跳舞的小东西，以及那些用明亮的眼睛透过树叶缝隙偷窥的生物，他都一一为其祈福了。他为上帝创造的万物祈福，人们在感到快乐的同时也充满了惊叹。不过从此以后漂洗场再也没有长出任何鲜花，那儿变得跟从前一样荒凉。美人鱼家族再也不像往常那样游到这个海湾里来了，他们迁徙到大海的其他地方去了。","And in the morning, while it was still dawn, he went forth with the monks and the musicians, and the candle-bearers and the swingers of censers, and a great company, and came to the shore of the sea, and blessed the sea, and all the wild things that are in it.The Fauns also he blessed, and the little things that dance in the woodland, and the bright-eyed things that peer through the leaves.All the things in God’s world he blessed, and the people were filled with joy and wonder.Yet never again in the corner of the Fullers’ Field grew flowers of any kind, but the field remained barren even as before.Nor came the Sea-folk into the bay as they had been wont to do, for they went to another part of the sea.   "
"星孩","The Stat-Child "
"从前，有两个穷苦的樵夫正穿越一片大松树林赶路回家。那是冬日里一个寒风刺骨的夜晚。地上和树上都积着厚厚的雪。一路上，两旁的小树枝接连不断地被霜折断。樵夫走到山涧瀑布时，瀑布在冰雪之王的亲吻下也凝结在了空中。","Once upon a time two poor Woodcutters were making their way home through a great pine-forest.It was winter, and a night of bitter cold.The snow lay thick upon the ground, and upon the branches of the trees: the frost kept snapping the little twigs on either side of them, as they passed: and when they came to the Mountain-Torrent she was hanging motionless in air, for the Ice-King had kissed her."
"这一夜实在是太冷了，连飞禽走兽们都不知道怎么办才好。","So cold was it that even the animals and the birds did not know what to make of it."
"“噢！”狼一边嚎叫一边夹着尾巴从灌木丛中一瘸一拐地走出来，“这天气真是糟透了。政府为什么不想想法子呢？”“喔！喔！喔！”朱顶雀喳喳地叫道，“大地寿终正寝了，人们已经用白色的寿衣替它收敛了。”","“Ugh!” snarled the Wolf, as he limped through the brushwood with his tail between his legs, “this is perfectly monstrous weather.Why doesn’t the Government look to it?” “Weet! weet! weet!” twittered the green Linnets, “the old Earth is dead and they have laid her out in her white shroud.” "
"“大地要出嫁了，这是它的婚纱。”斑鸠们彼此耳语着。斑鸠们的粉红色小脚都被冻坏了，不过他们觉得自己有责任充满浪漫主义地看待现状。","“The Earth is going to be married, and this is her bridal dress,” whispered the Turtle-doves to each other.Their little pink feet were quite frost-bitten, but they felt that it was their duty to take a romantic view of the situation."
"“胡说八道！”狼咆哮着说，“我跟你们说，这全都是政府的错，你们要是不相信我说的，我就把你们吃掉。”狼有着完全务实的思想，他总是能够有理有据地为自己辩解。","“Nonsense!” growled the Wolf.“I tell you that it is all the fault of the Government, and if you don’t believe me I shall eat you.”The Wolf had a thoroughly practical mind, and was never at a loss for a good argument."
"“唔，就我个人而言，”天生就是个哲学家的啄木鸟说道，“我不喜欢用原子理论找原因。事情该是什么样子，就是什么样子。眼下正是严寒。”天气的确是冷透了。小松鼠们呆在高大的杉树里边，用互相摩擦鼻子来取暖；野兔们也蜷缩在他们的洞里，连朝外面看上一眼都不敢。唯一喜欢这种天气的恐怕只有大角鸮。尽管羽毛让严霜冻得硬梆梆的，可是他们并不在意。他们不停地转动着黄色的大眼睛，隔着林子彼此叫唤着“吐威特！吐呼！吐威特！吐呼！今天天气真好呀！”两个樵夫穿着带铁钉的粗笨靴子踩在积雪上，继续赶路，并使劲地朝自己的手指上吹热气。有一次他们踩到一块光溜溜的石头，结果陷进了一个很深的雪坑，等他们爬出来时浑身上下白得跟从磨房出来的磨面师一样；又有一次他们在沼泽水凝结成的光滑坚冰上滑倒了，背上的柴捆也跟着散落了，他们只得拾起柴，重新捆好；还有一次他们以为自己迷路了，惊恐万分，因为他们深知雪对那些睡在它怀里的人是相当残酷的。不过他们信任那位好心的圣马丁，他会照顾所有出门在外的人。于是他们又按原路返回，小心翼翼地挪着步子，最后终于走出了森林，看到下面的山谷里远远地亮着灯，那正是他们居住的村庄。","“Well, for my own part,” said the Woodpecker, who was a born philosopher, “I don’t care an atomic theory for explanations.If a thing is so, it is so, and at present it is terribly cold.” Terribly cold it certainly was.The little Squirrels, who lived inside the tall fir-tree, kept rubbing each other’s noses to keep themselves warm, and the Rabbits curled themselves up in their holes, and did not venture even to look out of doors.The only people who seemed to enjoy it were the great horned Owls.Their feathers were quite stiff with rime, but they did not mind, and they rolled their large yellow eyes, and called out to each other across the forest, “Tu-whit!Tu-whoo!Tu-whit!Tu-whoo! what delightful weather we are having!” On and on went the two Woodcutters, blowing lustily upon their fingers, and stamping with their huge iron-shod boots upon the caked snow.Once they sank into a deep drift, and came out as white as millers are, when the stones are grinding; and once they slipped on the hard smooth ice where the marsh-water was frozen, and their faggots fell out of their bundles, and they had to pick them up and bind them together again; and once they thought that they had lost their way, and a great terror seized on them, for they knew that the Snow is cruel to those who sleep in her arms.But they put their trust in the good Saint Martin, who watches over all travellers, and retraced their steps, and went warily, and at last they reached the outskirts of the forest, and saw, far down in the valley beneath them, the lights of the village in which they dwelt."
"发现自己已经脱离了险境，他俩真是欣喜若狂，禁不住大笑起来。这时大地在他们的眼中如一朵银白色的鲜花，月亮就好像是一朵金花。","So overjoyed were they at their deliverance that they laughed aloud, and the Earth seemed to them like a flower of silver, and the Moon like a flower of gold."
"然而，欢喜过后，他们随即陷入了忧愁，因为他们想起了自己的寒酸处境。其中一个对另一个说：“有什么值得欢喜的呢，要知道生活是属于有钱人的，不是你我这样的人所享有的？我们还不如冻死在森林里，要不然等某个野兽来袭击我们，也会把我们杀掉。”“是啊，”他的伙伴说，“一些人被给予得太多，另一些人却得到得太少。不公平已经把整个世界瓜分了，除去忧愁，没有一样东西是公平分配的。”可就在他们相互悲叹自己的不幸时，一件怪事发生了。天边划过一颗非常明亮、非常美丽的星星。那颗星与其他星星擦肩而过，从天边滑落下来。他们呆呆地望着它，它似乎就落在离小羊圈不远处的一丛柳树后面。","Yet, after that they had laughed they became sad, for they remembered their poverty, and one of them said to the other, “Why did we make merry, seeing that life is for the rich, and not for such as we are?Better that we had died of cold in the forest, or that some wild beast had fallen upon us and slain us.” “Truly,” answered his companion, “much is given to some, and little is given to others.Injustice has parcelled out the world, nor is there equal division of aught save of sorrow.” But as they were bewailing their misery to each other this strange thing happened.There fell from heaven a very bright and beautiful star.It slipped down the side of the sky, passing by the other stars in its course, and, as they watched it wondering, it seemed to them to sink behind a clump of willow-trees that stood hard by a little sheepfold no more than a stone’s-throw away."
"“呀！谁要是找到它谁就可以得到一坛黄金！”他们边惊叫边跑过去，他们太渴望得到黄金了。","“Why! there is a crook of gold for whoever finds it,” they cried, and they set to and ran, so eager were they for the gold."
"其中跑得快的那个樵夫迅速超过了同伴，他奋力穿过柳树丛，来到了另一边。瞧！白皑皑的雪地上确实躺着一块黄金模样的东西。他靠得更近一点儿，弯下身用手去摸它。那是一件用金线织的斗篷，上面精心绣着好多星星，叠了很多层包着。他对同伴大喊道，他已经找到了从天上掉下来的财宝；等他的同伴跑上前来时，他俩就在雪地上坐下来，一层层地解开斗篷，想把金子拿出来平分。可是，哎！里头没有黄金，也没有白银，什么宝物都没有，只有一个熟睡的小孩子。","And one of them ran faster than his mate, and outstripped him, and forced his way through the willows, and came out on the other side, and lo! there was indeed a thing of gold lying on the white snow.So he hastened towards it, and stooping down placed his hands upon it, and it was a cloak of golden tissue, curiously wrought with stars, and wrapped in many folds.And he cried out to his comrade that he had found the treasure that had fallen from the sky, and when his comrade had come up, they sat them down in the snow, and loosened the folds of the cloak that they might divide the pieces of gold.But, alas! no gold was in it, nor silver, nor, indeed, treasure of any kind, but only a little child who was asleep."
"于是一个樵夫对另一人说：“我们的希望竟是这样一个痛苦的结局，我们的运气太差了，一个孩子对我们有什么用呢？我们还是把孩子放在原地，赶我们的路吧。我们可都是穷人，都有自己的孩子，总不能把自己孩子的那点面包分给别人吧。”可他的同伴却说：“这可不好，把孩子丢在雪地里让他冻死太不道德了。虽说我跟你一样穷，还得养活好几口人，锅里也没什么吃的，但我还是要带他回去，我的妻子会照顾他的。”于是他非常温柔地抱起小孩，用斗篷裹住孩子以抵御严寒，然后就下山回村子。他同伴对他的傻气和仁慈感到非常震惊。","And one of them said to the other: “This is a bitter ending to our hope, nor have we any good fortune, for what doth a child profit to a man?Let us leave it here, and go our way, seeing that we are poor men, and have children of our own whose bread we may not give to another.” But his companion answered him: “Nay, but it were an evil thing to leave the child to perish here in the snow, and though I am as poor as thou art, and have many mouths to feed, and but little in the pot, yet will I bring it home with me, and my wife shall have care of it.” So very tenderly he took up the child, and wrapped the cloak around it to shield it from the harsh cold, and made his way down the hill to the village, his comrade marvelling much at his foolishness and softness of heart."
"他们回到村子后，同伴对他说：“既然你得了这个孩子，那么把斗篷给我吧，我们应该平分。”但是他回答道：“不行，这个斗篷既不属于你，也不属于我，它只属于这孩子。”于是他跟同伴道别，走到自家门前，敲了敲门。","And when they came to the village, his comrade said to him, “Thou hast the child, therefore give me the cloak, for it is meet that we should share.” But he answered him: “Nay, for the cloak is neither mine nor thine, but the child’s only,” and he bade him Godspeed, and went to his own house and knocked."
"他的妻子打开门，看见自己的丈夫平安回到身边，便伸出双臂搂住他的脖子，吻了吻他，接着从他背上取下柴捆，刷掉他靴子上的雪，吩咐他快进屋。","And when his wife opened the door and saw that her husband had returned safe to her, she put her arms round his neck and kissed him, and took from his back the bundle of faggots, and brushed the snow off his boots, and bade him come in."
"然而他并没有进屋，说道：“我在森林里捡到一样东西，我把他带回来，希望你能照顾他。”","But he said to her, “I have found something in the forest, and I have brought it to thee to have care of it,” and he stirred not from the threshold."
"“是什么呀？”她叫道，“快给我看看，家里空荡荡的，我们缺的东西多着呢。”他解开斗篷，把熟睡的孩子抱给她看。","“What is it?” she cried.“Show it to me, for the house is bare, and we have need of many things.”And he drew the cloak back, and showed her the sleeping child."
"“哎哟，我的夫君！”她咕哝道，“我们自己又不是没有孩子，干嘛还要这么一个孩子带回家呢？谁知道他是不是个灾星呢？我们又拿什么来养活他呢。”妻子对樵夫非常生气。","“Alack, goodman!” she murmured, “have we not children of our own, that thou must needs bring a changeling to sit by the hearth?And who knows if it will not bring us bad fortune?And how shall we tend it.”And she was wroth against him."
"“别生气，他可是个星孩呢。”樵夫安慰妻子道。于是樵夫把发现孩子的奇异经历说给她听。","“Nay, but it is a Star-Child,” he answered; and he told her the strange manner of the finding of it."
"不过她一点儿也没有消气，反而挖苦他，还愤愤地说：“我们自己的孩子都没有面包吃，难道还要喂养别人的孩子吗？谁来关心我们呢？谁给我们食物呢？”“不要这样子，上帝连麻雀都能照顾到，上帝还喂养它们呢。”他回答说。","But she would not be appeased, but mocked at him, and spoke angrily, and cried: “Our children lack bread, and shall we feed the child of another?Who is there who careth for us?And who giveth us food?” “Nay, but God careth for the sparrows even, and feedeth them,” he answered."
"“冬天麻雀不是照样会饿死吗？”她问道，“现在不正是冬天吗？”樵夫无言以对，站在门口，只是不进屋。","“Do not the sparrows die of hunger in the winter?” she asked.“And is it not winter now?” And the man answered nothing, but stirred not from the threshold."
"一阵寒风经过森林刮过来，从敞开的房门钻进屋子。樵夫的妻子打了一个寒颤，哆嗦起来，对他说：“你就不能把门关上吗？冷风都吹进屋里了，我觉得好冷。”“屋里有一个铁石心肠的人，吹进来的风能不冷吗？”他反问道。女人不回答，蹑手蹑脚地靠近炉火。","And a bitter wind from the forest came in through the open door, and made her tremble, and she shivered, and said to him: “Wilt thou not close the door?There cometh a bitter wind into the house, and I am cold.” “Into a house where a heart is hard cometh there not always a bitter wind?” he asked.And the woman answered him nothing, but crept closer to the fire."
"过了一会儿，她转过身，望着他，眼里噙满泪水。　他立刻进了屋，把孩子放在她怀里。她吻了吻孩子，把他放在一张小床上，他们家最小的孩子也躺在那里。次日，樵夫取下那件奇特的金斗篷，把它放在一个大柜子里；他的妻子取下戴在孩子脖子上的琥珀项链，也放在柜子里了。","And after a time she turned round and looked at him, and her eyes were full of tears.And he came in swiftly, and placed the child in her arms, and she kissed it, and laid it in a little bed where the youngest of their own children was lying.And on the morrow the Woodcutter took the curious cloak of gold and placed it in a great chest, and a chain of amber that was round the child’s neck his wife took and set it in the chest also."
"就这样，星孩跟樵夫的孩子们一块儿被抚养长大，他同他们坐在一张餐桌上吃饭，还和他们一起玩耍。他一年比一年长得英俊，住在这个村子里的人都为此感到惊讶，因为他们都是黑皮肤、黑头发，唯独星孩长得又白又嫩，宛如精细打磨过的象牙。他的一头卷发好像水仙花的边沿。他的嘴唇像红色的花瓣，他的眼睛有如清水边的紫罗兰，而他的身材好像不曾被割草人涉足的田野里的水仙。","So the Star-Child was brought up with the children of the Woodcutter, and sat at the same board with them, and was their playmate.And every year he became more beautiful to look at, so that all those who dwelt in the village were filled with wonder, for, while they were swarthy and black-haired, he was white and delicate as sawn ivory, and his curls were like the rings of the daffodil.His lips, also, were like the petals of a red flower, and his eyes were like violets by a river of pure water, and his body like the narcissus of a field where the mower comes not."
"不过美貌带给他的却是邪恶因为他因此变得傲慢、冷酷、自私起来了。他瞧不起樵夫的孩子和村子里的其他孩子，说他们出身低微；而他是高贵的，由于他来自某个星球。他还自诩是他们的主人，把他们都唤作自己的仆人。他一点儿也不同情穷人，也不怜悯那些瞎子、残疾人以及任何有病痛的人。相反，他朝他们扔石子，把他们赶到大路上，要求他们到别处去乞讨。因此，只有那些亡命之徒才会再次到这个村子来寻求救济。他太迷恋美了。他常常嘲弄那些羸弱且长相不好的人，拿他们逗乐子。而他对自己爱得要命。夏季无风的时候，他会躺在神父果园的水井旁，朝井里看自己惊为天人的脸蛋，还一边孤芳自赏，一边得意地笑起来。","Yet did his beauty work him evil.For he grew proud, and cruel, and selfish.The children of the Woodcutter, and the other children of the village, he despised, saying that they were of mean parentage, while he was noble, being sprang from a Star, and he made himself master over them, and called them his servants.No pity had he for the poor, or for those who were blind or maimed or in any way afflicted, but would cast stones at them and drive them forth on to the highway, and bid them beg their bread elsewhere, so that none save the outlaws came twice to that village to ask for alms.Indeed, he was as one enamoured of beauty, and would mock at the weakly and ill-favoured, and make jest of them; and himself he loved, and in summer, when the winds were still, he would lie by the well in the priest’s orchard and look down at the marvel of his own face, and laugh for the pleasure he had in his fairness."
"樵夫和他的妻子常常责备他，说：“我们可没有像你对待那些可怜人那样对待你，也不像你那样不救济他们。你为什么要这么残酷地对待那些需要怜悯的人呢？”老神父也经常把星孩找来，试图教导他对生命心存爱心。神父劝诫他说：“飞蝇也是你的弟兄。不要伤害它。林中到处飞翔的野生鸟儿也有它们的自由。不要诱捕它们寻乐。上帝创造了无脚蜥蜴和鼹鼠，它们各自都有存在的价值。你是什么人，居然给上帝创造的世界带来苦痛？你知道吗，就连农田里的牲畜都知道赞美上帝。”","Often did the Woodcutter and his wife chide him, and say: “We did not deal with thee as thou dealest with those who are left desolate, and have none to succour them.Wherefore art thou so cruel to all who need pity?” Often did the old priest send for him, and seek to teach him the love of living things, saying to him: “The fly is thy brother.Do it no harm.The wild birds that roam through the forest have their freedom.Snare them not for thy pleasure.God made the blind-worm and the mole, and each has its place.Who art thou to bring pain into God’s world?Even the cattle of the field praise Him.”"
"但星孩哪里听得进他们的那些话，不过是皱着眉头，一副无所谓的样子，又跑回去找他的伙伴玩，当他们的头领。他的伙伴们也都愿意跟随着他。他长得美，而且身手矫捷；他还会跳舞、吹奏、创作音乐。不论星孩领他们去哪里，他们都欣然前往；不论星孩吩咐他们做什么，他们都唯命是从。当他把一根削尖的芦苇刺进鼹鼠迷蒙的眼睛里时，他们都开心地大笑；当他用石头砸麻风病人时，他们也跟着大笑。总之他们事事受他支使，变得跟他一样铁石心肠。","But the Star-Child heeded not their words, but would frown and flout, and go back to his companions, and lead them.And his companions followed him, for he was fair, and fleet of foot, and could dance, and pipe, and make music.And wherever the Star-Child led them they followed, and whatever the Star-Child bade them do, that did they.And when he pierced with a sharp reed the dim eyes of the mole, they laughed, and when he cast stones at the leper they laughed also.And in all things he ruled them, and they became hard of heart even as he was."
"一天，村子里来了一个可怜兮兮的女乞丐。她穿得破破烂烂的，崎岖的道路把她的双脚磨得血淋淋的，看起来狼狈不堪。由于太疲倦了，她坐在一棵栗子树下歇息。","Now there passed one day through the village a poor beggar-woman.Her garments were torn and ragged, and her feet were bleeding from the rough road on which she had travelled, and she was in very evil plight.And being weary she sat her down under a chestnut-tree to rest."
"星孩看见她后，便朝他的同伴们叫道：“看！这么肮脏的一个讨饭女人竟然坐在那棵美丽的绿叶树下面。走，我们去把她赶走，她看起来真是又丑又惹人厌。”于是他跑过去，朝她扔石头，嘲弄她；女乞丐直勾勾地望着他，眼里带着惊恐。樵夫正在附近的草料场里劈柴，目睹了星孩的所做所为，他便跑上去斥责他：“你的心真是太狠了，一点儿怜悯之情都没有，这个可怜的女人做了什么伤害你的事，你要如此对待她？”星孩气得满脸通红，跺着脚吼道：“你算老几，干涉我做什么？我又不是你的亲生儿子，不要你管。”“你说的一点儿不假，”樵夫说，“当初在森林里发现你时，我是对你动了怜悯之心。”听到这些话，女人大叫一声便昏倒了。樵夫把她抱进屋，让他的妻子照顾她。等她从昏迷中醒来后，樵夫夫妇为她拿来了吃的和喝的，还安慰她放宽心。","But when the Star-Child saw her, he said to his companions, “See!There sitteth a foul beggar-woman under that fair and green-leaved tree.Come, let us drive her hence, for she is ugly and ill-favoured.” So he came near and threw stones at her, and mocked her, and she looked at him with terror in her eyes, nor did she move her gaze from him.And when the Woodcutter, who was cleaving logs in a hag hard by, saw what the Star-Child was doing, he ran up and rebuked him, and said to him: “Surely thou art hard of heart and knowest not mercy, for what evil has this poor woman done to thee that thou shouldst treat her in this wise?” And the Star-Child grew red with anger, and stamped his foot upon the ground, and said, “Who art thou to question me what I do?I am no son of thine to do thy bidding.” “Thou speakest truly,” answered the Wood-cutter, “yet did I show thee pity when I found thee in the forest.” And when the woman heard these words she gave a loud cry, and fell into a swoon.And the Woodcutter carried her to his own house, and his wife had care of her, and when she rose up from the swoon into which she had fallen, they set meat and drink before her, and bade her have comfort."
"可是她既不肯吃又不肯喝，单单问樵夫：“你刚才不是说那个孩子是在森林中找到的吗？那是不是十年前的事？”樵夫回答说：“是呀，我是在森林里发现他的，离现在已有十年了。”“当时你在他身上发现了什么记号吗？”她激动地问，“他的脖子上是不是戴了一串琥珀项链？他的身上是不是裹着一件金线织的斗篷，上面绣有星星？”“正是，”樵夫回答说，“跟你说的一模一样。”于是他拿出放在柜子里的斗篷和琥珀项链给她看。","But she would neither eat nor drink, but said to the Woodcutter, “Didst thou not say that the child was found in the forest?And was it not ten years from this day?” And the Woodcutter answered, “Yea, it was in the forest that I found him, and it is ten years from this day.” “And what signs didst thou find with him?” she cried.“Bare he not upon his neck a chain of amber?Was not round him a cloak of gold tissue broidered with stars?” “Truly,” answered the Woodcutter, “it was even as thou sayest.”And he took the cloak and the amber chain from the chest where they lay, and showed them to her."
"一看见这些东西，她马上喜极而泣，激动地说：“他就是我那丢失在森林里的小儿子。我求你快唤他进来，为了找他，我已经走遍了整个世界。”樵夫和他的妻子赶紧跑出去喊星孩，对他说：“快回屋去，你会见到你的母亲，她正等着你。”于是星孩诧异而狂喜地跑进屋里。然而当看见等他的人是那个女乞丐时，他便讥笑道：“喂，我母亲在哪里？怎么我看见的只有这么一个可怜的女乞丐。”女人对他说：“我就是你的母亲。”“你这么说真是疯了。”星孩怒气冲冲地吼道，“我才不是你的儿子。你是一个乞丐，又丑，穿得又破烂不堪。你快走吧，不要让我再看见你这张脏兮兮的脸。”“不，你千真万确是我的小儿子啊，你是我在森林里生下的。”她大声哭喊着，又一下子跪在地上，向他伸出双臂。“强盗们把你从我身边偷走，扔在森林里，企图害死你。”她喃喃地说，“可是我一看见你就认出来了，我还认得那些信物：金线织的斗篷和琥珀项链。我求你跟我走吧。为了找到你，我已经走遍了整个世界。跟我走吧，我的孩子，我需要你的爱。”但是星孩一点儿也不为所动，打心底里抵触她。此刻，除了女人痛苦的哭声，别的什么声音也听不到。","And when she saw them she wept for joy, and said, “He is my little son whom I lost in the forest.I pray thee send for him quickly, for in search of him have I wandered over the whole world.” So the Woodcutter and his wife went out and called to the Star-Child, and said to him, “Go into the house, and there shalt thou find thy mother, who is waiting for thee.” So he ran in, filled with wonder and great gladness.But when he saw her who was waiting there, he laughed scornfully and said, “Why, where is my mother?For I see none here but this vile beggar-woman.” And the woman answered him, “I am thy mother.” “Thou art mad to say so,” cried the Star-Child angrily.“I am no son of thine, for thou art a beggar, and ugly, and in rags.Therefore get thee hence, and let me see thy foul face no more.” “Nay, but thou art indeed my little son, whom I bare in the forest,” she cried, and she fell on her knees, and held out her arms to him.“The robbers stole thee from me, and left thee to die,” she murmured, “but I recognised thee when I saw thee, and the signs also have I recognised, the cloak of golden tissue and the amber chain.Therefore I pray thee come with me, for over the whole world have I wandered in search of thee.Come with me, my son, for I have need of thy love.” But the Star-Child stirred not from his place, but shut the doors of his heart against her, nor was there any sound heard save the sound of the woman weeping for pain."
"最后他终于对她说话了，口气非常生硬、尖酸。“就算你真的是我的母亲，”他说，“你最好也给我走得远远的，不要再到这儿来给我丢脸。我知道我是某个星球的孩子，而不是像你刚才对我说的那样，是一个乞丐的儿子。快走吧，不要让我再看见你。”“唉！我的孩子啊，”她哭着说道，“在我离开之前你都不愿吻我一下吗？我历经了多少磨难才把你找着啊。”“我才不要。”星孩说，“你难看死了，我宁愿去吻毒蛇或蟾蜍，也不要吻你。”那女人站起来，痛哭着离开了，走进了森林。星孩看见她走后非常得意，便跑去找他的同伴，准备跟他们一块儿玩。","And at last he spoke to her, and his voice was hard and bitter.“If in very truth thou art my mother,” he said, “it had been better hadst thou stayed away, and not come here to bring me to shame, seeing that I thought I was the child of some Star, and not a beggar’s child, as thou tellest me that I am.Therefore get thee hence, and let me see thee no more.” “Alas! my son,” she cried, “wilt thou not kiss me before I go?For I have suffered much to find thee.” “Nay,” said the Star-Child, “but thou art too foul to look at, and rather would I kiss the adder or the toad than thee.” So the woman rose up, and went away into the forest weeping bitterly, and when the Star-Child saw that she had gone, he was glad, and ran back to his playmates that he might play with them."
"然而当他们看见他回来时，都纷纷嘲笑他说：“喂，你变得跟蟾蜍一样丑陋，跟毒蛇一样可恶了。快滚开吧，我们可受不了跟你这样的丑八怪一起玩儿。”于是他们把他赶出了花园。","But when they beheld him coming, they mocked him and said, “Why, thou art as foul as the toad, and as loathsome as the adder.Get thee hence, for we will not suffer thee to play with us,” and they drave him out of the garden."
"星孩皱了皱眉头，自言自语地说：“他们说的是什么疯话呀？我要到水井边，朝水井里面看看，水井会告诉我我有多么美。”他便来到了水井边，朝井里望去。可是瞧啊！他的脸变成了蟾蜍的模样，他的身子变成了毒蛇的样子。他一下子扑倒在草地上，伤心地哭起来，对自己说：“这一定是我的罪孽带给我的报应。我不认自己的亲生母亲，还把她赶走了，对她既傲慢又冷酷无情。为此我要走遍天涯海角去寻找母亲，不找到她我绝不罢休。”这时樵夫的小女儿朝他走了过来，她把手放在他的肩膀上，对他说：“你纵然失去了美貌，那又有什么关系呢？还是留下来跟我们呆在一起，我不会嘲笑你的。”可他对她说：“不行，我对我的母亲太冷酷了。我如此邪恶，我罪有应得。所以我要去寻找我的母亲，哪怕要走遍全世界，我也要把她找到，请求她宽恕我的罪孽。”于是他朝森林跑去，呼唤他的母亲，恳求她回到自己的身边，可是没有任何回应。他一整天都在呼唤她。太阳下山了，他躺在一层落叶上睡觉。鸟儿和野兽们见到他都纷纷逃开了，因为他们忘不了他的残忍。他就那么孤零零地一个人呆着，只有蟾蜍会瞅瞅他，毒蛇缓缓地从他面前爬过。","And the Star-Child frowned and said to himself, “What is this that they say to me?I will go to the well of water and look into it, and it shall tell me of my beauty.” So he went to the well of water and looked into it, and lo! his face was as the face of a toad, and his body was sealed like an adder.And he flung himself down on the grass and wept, and said to himself, “Surely this has come upon me by reason of my sin.For I have denied my mother, and driven her away, and been proud, and cruel to her.Wherefore I will go and seek her through the whole world, nor will I rest till I have found her.” And there came to him the little daughter of the Woodcutter, and she put her hand upon his shoulder and said, “What doth it matter if thou hast lost thy comeliness?Stay with us, and I will not mock at thee.” And he said to her, “Nay, but I have been cruel to my mother, and as a punishment has this evil been sent to me.Wherefore I must go hence, and wander through the world till I find her, and she give me her forgiveness.” So he ran away into the forest and called out to his mother to come to him, but there was no answer.All day long he called to her, and, when the sun set he lay down to sleep on a bed of leaves, and the birds and the animals fled from him, for they remembered his cruelty, and he was alone save for the toad that watched him, and the slow adder that crawled past."
"早晨他爬起来，从树上摘下几颗生涩的浆果吃，然后穿行在大森林里，边走边伤心地哭着。不管遇到谁，他都要上前询问他们可曾碰巧见过他的母亲。","And in the morning he rose up, and plucked some bitter berries from the trees and ate them, and took his way through the great wood, weeping sorely.And of everything that he met he made inquiry if perchance they had seen his mother."
"他对鼹鼠说：“你能够钻到地底下去。告诉我，我的母亲在哪儿啊？”鼹鼠回答说：“你弄瞎了我的眼睛。我怎么知道呢？他又对朱顶雀说：“你能飞上大树树梢，可以看见整个世界。告诉我，你见到我母亲了吗？”朱顶雀回答说：“你为了取乐已经把我的翅膀剪掉了。我如何飞得起来呢？”他又问那只孤身住在冷杉上的小松鼠：“我的母亲在哪里？”小松鼠回答说：“你把我的母亲杀死了。难道你还想杀死你的亲生母亲吗？”星孩哭了，埋下头，恳求上帝创造的这些生物能够宽恕他。他继续走在森林里，寻找那个女乞丐。第三天，他走出了森林，来到了平原上。","He said to the Mole, “Thou canst go beneath the earth.Tell me, is my mother there?” And the Mole answered, “Thou hast blinded mine eyes.How should I know?” He said to the Linnet, “Thou canst fly over the tops of the tall trees, and canst see the whole world.Tell me, canst thou see my mother?” And the Linnet answered, “Thou hast clipt my wings for thy pleasure.How should I fly?” And to the little Squirrel who lived in the fir-tree, and was lonely, he said, “Where is my mother?” And the Squirrel answered, “Thou hast slain mine.Dost thou seek to slay thine also?” And the Star-Child wept and bowed his head, and prayed forgiveness of God’s things, and went on through the forest, seeking for the beggar-woman.And on the third day he came to the other side of the forest and went down into the plain."
"星孩路过村庄时，孩子们都嘲笑他，并朝他扔石头。他看上去是那么脏，乡下人甚至连牛棚都不给他睡，生怕他将霉菌带到堆放的谷物上去了。他们还请人赶他走，村子里没有一个人同情他。三年来，他走遍了世界各地，可他没打听到半点关于那个讨饭女人——他母亲的消息。然而冥冥中他总感觉到她就在他前面。他呼唤她、追赶她，直到双脚被坚硬的燧石磨出了血。然而他怎么也追不上她，而那些住在路边的人都说他们没有见过她或者像她那样的女人。更糟糕的是，他们都拿他的悲痛寻开心。","And when he passed through the villages the children mocked him, and threw stones at him, and the carlots would not suffer him even to sleep in the byres lest he might bring mildew on the stored corn, so foul was he to look at, and their hired men drave him away, and there was none who had pity on him.Nor could he hear anywhere of the beggar-woman who was his mother, though for the space of three years he wandered over the world, and often seemed to see her on the road in front of him, and would call to her, and run after her till the sharp flints made his feet to bleed.But overtake her he could not, and those who dwelt by the way did ever deny that they had seen her, or any like to her, and they made sport of his sorrow."
"三年来，他走遍了整个世界。这个世界上没有人爱他，也没有人关心他、怜悯他，然而这样的世界正如他以前得意时一手缔造的一样。","For the space of three years he wandered over the world, and in the world there was neither love nor loving-kindness nor charity for him, but it was even such a world as he had made for himself in the days of his great pride."
"一天晚上，他来到了一座城门下，这座城依水而建，城墙坚固。他不顾疲惫和脚痛，准备进城。但是守卫在城门口的士兵们横下戟把他拦下，粗暴地对他说：“你进城干什么？”“我来寻找我的母亲。”他回答说，“我恳求你批准我进城，也许她就在这座城里。”可是他们嘲弄他；其中一个士兵一边把弄着自己的黑胡须，一边放下手中的盾牌，叫嚷道：“也不怕说了伤你心，你母亲看见你这个样子，她一定会难过的，因为你比沼泽地里的蟾蜍和在那儿爬行的毒蛇还要令人厌恶。快滚开。快滚开。你母亲不在这城里。”另一个手中拿着一面黄旗的士兵问他：“谁是你母亲？你为何要找她呢？”星孩回答说：“我母亲跟我一样也是个乞丐；曾经我对她很残忍。我恳求你准许我进去，或许她恰好就在城中，我好让她宽恕我。”不过他们仍不许他进城，还用长矛戳他。","And one evening he came to the gate of a strong-walled city that stood by a river, and, weary and footsore though he was, he made to enter in.But the soldiers who stood on guard dropped their halberts across the entrance, and said roughly to him, “What is thy business in the city?” “I am seeking for my mother,” he answered, “and I pray ye to suffer me to pass, for it may be that she is in this city.” But they mocked at him, and one of them wagged a black beard, and set down his shield and cried, “Of a truth, thy mother will not be merry when she sees thee, for thou art more ill-favoured than the toad of the marsh, or the adder that crawls in the fen.Get thee gone.Get thee gone.Thy mother dwells not in this city.” And another, who held a yellow banner in his hand, said to him, “Who is thy mother, and wherefore art thou seeking for her?” And he answered, “My mother is a beggar even as I am, and I have treated her evilly, and I pray ye to suffer me to pass that she may give me her forgiveness, if it be that she tarrieth in this city.”But they would not, and pricked him with their spears."
"正当星孩哭着转身走开时，一个人走上前来。这人身披铠甲，上面镶嵌着镀金花饰；他的头盔上有一尊带翅膀雄狮的雕像。他前来询问士兵是谁要求进城。士兵回答说：“一个乞丐，他母亲也是个乞丐，我们已经把他给赶走了。”“不，”那人笑着说，“我们可以把这个丑家伙当奴隶卖掉，他值一碗甜酒的钱。”这时一个又老又丑的人路过，他大声说：“我愿意出那个价买下他。”于是他付了钱，拉着星孩的手带他进城去了。","And, as he turned away weeping, one whose armour was inlaid with gilt flowers, and on whose helmet couched a lion that had wings, came up and made inquiry of the soldiers who it was who had sought entrance.And they said to him, “It is a beggar and the child of a beggar, and we have driven him away.” “Nay,” he cried, laughing, “but we will sell the foul thing for a slave, and his price shall be the price of a bowl of sweet wine.” And an old and evil-visaged man who was passing by called out, and said, “I will buy him for that price,” and, when he had paid the price, he took the Star-Child by the hand and led him into the city."
"他们穿过好几条街道，最后来到一扇小门前，门边的墙上探出一棵石榴树。老人用一枚碧玉雕刻成的戒指碰了一下门，门就开了。他们走下五级黄铜台阶，来到了一个花园，花园里开满了黑色的罂粟花，另外还有很多绿色的陶制瓦罐。然后老人从他的包头巾上取下一条提花丝巾，蒙住星孩的眼睛，在前面拽着星孩走。等到眼睛上的丝巾被解开后，星孩发现自己在一座地牢中，里面点着一盏牛角灯笼。","And after that they had gone through many streets they came to a little door that was set in a wall that was covered with a pomegranate tree.And the old man touched the door with a ring of graved jasper and it opened, and they went down five steps of brass into a garden filled with black poppies and green jars of burnt clay.And the old man took then from his turban a scarf of figured silk, and bound with it the eyes of the Star-Child, and drave him in front of him.And when the scarf was taken off his eyes, the Star-Child found himself in a dungeon, that was lit by a lantern of horn."
"老人在星孩面前摆上一个木盘，里面放着发霉的面包，并对他说：“吃吧。”又用一个杯子盛着变味了的水，对他说：“喝吧。”等星孩吃喝完了，老人锁上门，用一根铁链加固后便走开了。","And the old man set before him some mouldy bread on a trencher and said, “Eat,” and some brackish water in a cup and said, “Drink,” and when he had eaten and drunk, the old man went out, locking the door behind him and fastening it with an iron chain."
"次日，老人来见他。这位老人实际上是利比亚最出色的魔术师，他师承一位后来葬在尼罗河中的大师。老人皱着眉对他说：“在这座异教徒城市的城门附近有个森林，那里藏着三枚金币。一枚是白色的，另一枚是黄色的，第三枚是红色的。　今天你去把白色的那枚给我拿回来，要是拿不回来的话，我就抽你一百鞭。快去吧，太阳下山时我会在花园口等你。记住是把白色的那枚拿回来，要不然你会倒霉的。你是我的奴隶，我可是花了一碗甜酒的价钱把你买下来的。”他又用那块提花丝巾蒙住星孩的眼睛，领他穿过房子，穿过罂粟花园，走上五级黄铜台阶。他用戒指打开那扇小门，把星孩扔在大街上。","And on the morrow the old man, who was indeed the subtlest of the magicians of Libya and had learned his art from one who dwelt in the tombs of the Nile, came in to him and frowned at him, and said, “In a wood that is nigh to the gate of this city of Giaours there are three pieces of gold.One is of white gold, and another is of yellow gold, and the gold of the third one is red.To-day thou shalt bring me the piece of white gold, and if thou bringest it not back, I will beat thee with a hundred stripes.Get thee away quickly, and at sunset I will be waiting for thee at the door of the garden.See that thou bringest the white gold, or it shall go ill with thee, for thou art my slave, and I have bought thee for the price of a bowl of sweet wine.”And he bound the eyes of the Star-Child with the scarf of figured silk, and led him through the house, and through the garden of poppies, and up the five steps of brass.And having opened the little door with his ring he set him in the street."
"接着星孩就走出了城门，来到了魔术师告诉他的那个森林中。","And the Star-Child went out of the gate of the city, and came to the wood of which the Magician had spoken to him."
"乍一看，这个森林非常美，似乎还是一派鸟语花香的气象，于是星孩欣喜地走了进去。然而森林的美并没有给他带来什么好处。又粗又尖的荆棘遍地丛生，挡住他的去路；凶恶的荨麻刺他，蓟也拿刺戳他，使他悲伤不已。他到处都找不到魔术师说的那块白色的金币，尽管他从早晨找到中午，又从中午找到日落。太阳下山后他只好往回走，一路伤心地哭着，因为他知道会有什么样的厄运在等着他。","Now this wood was very fair to look at from without, and seemed full of singing birds and of sweet-scented flowers, and the Star-Child entered it gladly.Yet did its beauty profit him little, for wherever he went harsh briars and thorns shot up from the ground and encompassed him, and evil nettles stung him, and the thistle pierced him with her daggers, so that he was in sore distress.Nor could he anywhere find the piece of white gold of which the Magician had spoken, though he sought for it from morn to noon, and from noon to sunset.And at sunset he set his face towards home, weeping bitterly, for he knew what fate was in store for him."
"可就在他快要走出森林时，他听见灌木丛中传来痛苦的叫声。他抛掉自己的烦恼，循声跑回去，发现一只小野兔掉进了猎人设下的陷阱里。","But when he had reached the outskirts of the wood, he heard from a thicket a cry as of some one in pain.And forgetting his own sorrow he ran back to the place, and saw there a little Hare caught in a trap that some hunter had set for it."
"星孩很同情野兔，就把它给放了，并对它说：“我也只是个奴隶，不过我可以还你自由。”野兔回答他说：“你给了我自由，我拿什么回报你呢？”星孩对它说：“我正在寻找一枚白色的金币，可我在哪儿也找不到它。如果我不能把它找到交给我的主人，我就要挨打。”“你跟我来吧，”野兔说，“我带你去，因为我知道它藏在什么地方，还知道为什么要藏在那儿。”于是星孩跟着野兔走了。瞧！就在一棵大橡树的裂缝中星孩看到了自己正要寻找的那枚白色金币。他兴奋地抓起金币，对野兔说：“我只是为你做了那么一点点事情，你却回报了我这么多；我只是对你施予了小小的恩惠，你却百倍地报答了我。”“不，”野兔说，“我只不过是用你对待我的方式对待你而已。”说完野兔就跑开了，星孩也往城里走去。","And the Star-Child had pity on it, and released it, and said to it, “I am myself but a slave, yet may I give thee thy freedom.” And the Hare answered him, and said: “Surely thou hast given me freedom, and what shall I give thee in return?” And the Star-Child said to it, “I am seeking for a piece of white gold, nor can I anywhere find it, and if I bring it not to my master he will beat me.” “Come thou with me,” said the Hare, “and I will lead thee to it, for I know where it is hidden, and for what purpose.” So the Star-Child went with the Hare, and lo! in the cleft of a great oak-tree he saw the piece of white gold that he was seeking.And he was filled with joy, and seized it, and said to the Hare, “The service that I did to thee thou hast rendered back again many times over, and the kindness that I showed thee thou hast repaid a hundred-fold.” “Nay,” answered the Hare, “but as thou dealt with me, so I did deal with thee,” and it ran away swiftly, and the Star-Child went towards the city."
"城门口坐着一个麻风病人。他的脸给灰色的亚麻布头巾罩住了，露出的一双眼睛像烧红的炭似的闪闪发光。看到星孩走过来，他便敲一只木碗，摇响他的铃铛，大声呼喊星孩：“给我一点儿钱吧，不然我会饿死的。他们把我赶出了城，没有一个人同情我。”“唉！”星孩说道，“我口袋里只有一枚钱币呀，要是我不把它带给我的主人，他就会打我，因为我是他的奴隶。”可是麻风病人还是苦苦哀求他，直到星孩动了怜悯之心，把白色的金币给了他。","Now at the gate of the city there was seated one who was a leper.Over his face hung a cowl of grey linen, and through the eyelets his eyes gleamed like red coals.And when he saw the Star-Child coming, he struck upon a wooden bowl, and clattered his bell, and called out to him, and said, “Give me a piece of money, or I must die of hunger.For they have thrust me out of the city, and there is no one who has pity on me.” “Alas!” cried the Star-Child, “I have but one piece of money in my wallet, and if I bring it not to my master he will beat me, for I am his slave.” But the leper entreated him, and prayed of him, till the Star-Child had pity, and gave him the piece of white gold."
"等星孩回到魔术师的房子，魔术师为他开了门，待他进屋后便问道：“你拿到那枚白色的金币了吗？”星孩回答说：“我没有找到。”于是魔术师扑过去，抽打他，之后朝他面前扔了一个空木盘，对他说：“我让你吃。”又给了他一个空杯子，说：“我让你喝。”然后又把他推到地牢中去了。","And when he came to the Magician’s house, the Magician opened to him, and brought him in, and said to him, “Hast thou the piece of white gold.”And the Star-Child answered, “I have it not.”So the Magician fell upon him, and beat him, and set before him an empty trencher, and said, “Eat,” and an empty cup, and said, “Drink,” and flung him again into the dungeon."
"第二天，魔术师又来到他身边，对他说：“你今天要是不把那枚黄色的金币给我拿回来，我一定要你继续做我的奴隶，还要抽你三百鞭。”于是星孩又到森林中去了，一整天他都在寻找那枚黄色的金币，可哪儿也找不到。太阳下山了，他坐下来，哭了起来。这时，那只他从陷阱中救出来的小野兔朝他跑了过来。野兔问他：“你为什么哭啊？你在森林中寻找什么吗？”星孩回答说：“我在寻找一枚黄色的金币，它就藏在这里。如果我找不到它的话，我的主人就会打我，继续把我当奴隶对待。”“跟我来吧。”野兔边大声喊边飞快地朝林子跑去，一直跑到一个水潭边。那枚黄色的金币就躺在水潭底。","And on the morrow the Magician came to him, and said, “If to-day thou bringest me not the piece of yellow gold, I will surely keep thee as my slave, and give thee three hundred stripes.” So the Star-Child went to the wood, and all day long he searched for the piece of yellow gold, but nowhere could he find it.And at sunset he sat him down and began to weep, and as he was weeping there came to him the little Hare that he had rescued from the trap. And the Hare said to him, “Why art thou weeping?And what dost thou seek in the wood?” And the Star-Child answered, “I am seeking for a piece of yellow gold that is hidden here, and if I find it not my master will beat me, and keep me as a slave.” “Follow me,” cried the Hare, and it ran through the wood till it came to a pool of water.And at the bottom of the pool the piece of yellow gold was lying."
"“我该如何感谢你呢？”星孩说，“因为你瞧！这已经是你第二次救我了。”“不客气，是你先救了我的。”说完野兔就飞快地跑了。","“How shall I thank thee?” said the Star-Child, “for lo! this is the second time that you have succoured me.” “Nay, but thou hadst pity on me first,” said the Hare, and it ran away swiftly."
"星孩拿到那枚黄色的金币之后，把它放在口袋里，匆匆地往城里走。但是那个麻风病人看见他走了过来，就跑上去，跪倒在他跟前哭着说：“给我一点儿钱吧，要不然我会饿死的。”星孩对他说：“我的口袋里只有一枚黄色的金币，如果我不把它交给我的主人，他就要打我，并继续让我当奴隶的。”可是麻风病人仍旧苦苦地哀求，于是星孩又动了怜悯之心，把那枚黄色的金币给了他。","And the Star-Child took the piece of yellow gold, and put it in his wallet, and hurried to the city.But the leper saw him coming, and ran to meet him, and knelt down and cried, “Give me a piece of money or I shall die of hunger.” And the Star-Child said to him, “I have in my wallet but one piece of yellow gold, and if I bring it not to my master he will beat me and keep me as his slave.” But the leper entreated him sore, so that the Star-Child had pity on him, and gave him the piece of yellow gold."
"等他回到魔术师的住处，魔术师为他开了门，让他进屋，问他：“你找到那枚黄色的金币了吗？”星孩对他说：“我没有找到。”魔术师又朝他扑过去，抽打他，还用链条把他锁住，又把他扔进了地牢里。","And when he came to the Magician’s house, the Magician opened to him, and brought him in, and said to him, “Hast thou the piece of yellow gold.”And the Star-Child said to him, “I have it not.”So the Magician fell upon him, and beat him, and loaded him with chains, and cast him again into the dungeon."
"第三天，魔术师又来了，对他说：“你今天要是把那枚红色的金币给我带回来的话，我就放了你；否则，你必死无疑。”于是星孩又去了森林中，一整天他都在寻找那枚红色的金币，但是哪儿也找不到。傍晚，他坐下来，哭了起来。这时，小野兔又跑到他的跟前。","And on the morrow the Magician came to him, and said, “If to-day thou bringest me the piece of red gold I will set thee free, but if thou bringest it not I will surely slay thee.” So the Star-Child went to the wood, and all day long he searched for the piece of red gold, but nowhere could he find it.And at evening he sat him down and wept, and as he was weeping there came to him the little Hare."
"野兔对他说：“你要找的那块红色的金币就在你身后的那个山洞里。你应该高兴才对，不要再哭了。”“我如何才能报答你呢？”星孩大声说，“因为你瞧！这已经是你第三次救我了。”“不客气，是你先救我的。”说完野兔就敏捷地跑开了。","And the Hare said to him, “The piece of red gold that thou seekest is in the cavern that is behind thee.Therefore weep no more but be glad.” “How shall I reward thee?” cried the Star-Child, “for lo! this is the third time thou hast succoured me.” “Nay, but thou hadst pity on me first,” said the Hare, and it ran away swiftly."
"星孩钻进洞里，在洞的最深处发现了那枚红色的金币。于是他把金币放进了口袋，匆忙地赶回城。那个麻风病人看见他来了，就站在路的中央，大声痛哭起来，并对他说：“快给我那枚红色的金币吧，否则我就必死无疑了。”星孩又一次对他动了恻隐之心，把那枚红色的金币给了他，还说：“你比我更需要这个。”可是此时他的心情非常沉重，因为他清楚什么样的厄运在等待着他。","And the Star-Child entered the cavern, and in its farthest corner he found the piece of red gold.So he put it in his wallet, and hurried to the city.And the leper seeing him coming, stood in the centre of the road, and cried out, and said to him, “Give me the piece of red money, or I must die,” and the Star-Child had pity on him again, and gave him the piece of red gold, saying, “Thy need is greater than mine.” Yet was his heart heavy, for he knew what evil fate awaited him."
"但是瞧啊！在他经过城门的时候，卫兵们都向他鞠躬行礼，赞叹道：“我们的皇上多么英俊啊！”一群市民跟着他，高声欢呼道：“全世界都没有谁比他更英俊了！”星孩却哭了起来，自言自语道：“他们又嘲笑我了，把快乐建立在我的痛苦之上。”人越聚越多，星孩在人群里迷了路，最后发现自己来到了一个巨大的广场上，这里正是国王的宫殿。","But lo! as he passed through the gate of the city, the guards bowed down and made obeisance to him, saying, “How beautiful is our lord!” and a crowd of citizens followed him, and cried out, “Surely there is none so beautiful in the whole world!” so that the Star-Child wept, and said to himself, “They are mocking me, and making light of my misery.”And so large was the concourse of the people, that he lost the threads of his way, and found himself at last in a great square, in which there was a palace of a King."
"王宫的大门打开了，牧师和大臣们都出来迎接他。他们对他鞠躬行礼，说：“您就是我们正在恭迎的皇上，我们国王的爱子。”星孩回答他们说：“我不是国王的儿子，而是一个穷苦女乞丐的儿子。你们为什么说我漂亮呢？我知道自己的长相有多难看。”这时，那位身披嵌着镀金花饰的铠甲、头盔上有一头带翅膀雄狮雕像的人，手里举着一面盾牌大声说道：“我们的皇上怎么能说自己不英俊呢？”星孩抬头望去，瞧啊！他的脸又变得跟从前一样了，他又恢复了从前的美貌；而且他还看到自己的眼中有一种以前不曾见过的东西。","And the gate of the palace opened, and the priests and the high officers of the city ran forth to meet him, and they abased themselves before him, and said, “Thou art our lord for whom we have been waiting, and the son of our King.” And the Star-Child answered them and said, “I am no king’s son, but the child of a poor beggar-woman.And how say ye that I am beautiful, for I know that I am evil to look at?” Then he, whose armour was inlaid with gilt flowers, and on whose helmet crouched a lion that had wings, held up a shield, and cried, “How saith my lord that he is not beautiful?” And the Star-Child looked, and lo! his face was even as it had been, and his comeliness had come back to him, and he saw that in his eyes which he had not seen there before."
"神父和大臣们跪在他面前，对他说：“一个古老的预言曾说过，就在今天，会出现一个王来统领我们。所以，请我们的皇上接受这顶皇冠和这根权杖，用您的公正和仁爱来统领我们吧。”不过星孩却对他们说：“我不配，因为我曾经连自己的亲生母亲都不认。在没有找到她并得到她的宽恕之前，我是不会罢休的。所以，还是让我走吧。我必须再次寻遍整个世界。即使是你们要把皇冠和权仗给我，我也不能在此停留。”说完这番话后，他转身朝向通往城门的街上。瞧啊！星孩在士兵周围的人群中看见了那位女乞丐——他的母亲，她身旁站着一个麻风病人，就是曾经坐在路旁向他讨钱的那个人。","And the priests and the high officers knelt down and said to him, “It was prophesied of old that on this day should come he who was to rule over us.Therefore, let our lord take this crown and this sceptre, and be in his justice and mercy our King over us.” But he said to them, “I am not worthy, for I have denied the mother who bare me, nor may I rest till I have found her, and known her forgiveness.Therefore, let me go, for I must wander again over the world, and may not tarry here, though ye bring me the crown and the sceptre.”And as he spake he turned his face from them towards the street that led to the gate of the city, and lo! amongst the crowd that pressed round the soldiers, he saw the beggar-woman who was his mother, and at her side stood the leper, who had sat by the road."
"星孩高兴地叫了起来，跑过去跪下，吻他母亲脚上的伤口，泪水浸湿他母亲的双脚。他把头埋得很低，碰到了尘土，哭得仿佛心都要碎了一样。星孩对她说：“母亲，在我傲慢的时候我没有认您。现在请在我卑微的时候收下我吧。母亲，我曾经厌恶您。现在请您给予我爱吧。母亲，我曾经拒绝过您。现在请您收下您的孩子吧。”然而讨饭的女人一言不发。","And a cry of joy broke from his lips, and he ran over, and kneeling down he kissed the wounds on his mother’s feet, and wet them with his tears.He bowed his head in the dust, and sobbing, as one whose heart might break, he said to her: “Mother, I denied thee in the hour of my pride.Accept me in the hour of my humility.Mother, I gave thee hatred.Do thou give me love.Mother, I rejected thee.Receive thy child now.”But the beggar-woman answered him not a word."
"他又伸出手，紧紧抓住那个麻风病人苍白的双脚，对他说：“我对你施过三次恩惠。请叫我的母亲答应我一声吧。”可是麻风病人也一声不吭。","And he reached out his hands, and clasped the white feet of the leper, and said to him: “Thrice did I give thee of my mercy.Bid my mother speak to me once.”But the leper answered him not a word."
"他又哭了起来，说：“母亲，我的痛苦远非我承受得起的。您就宽恕我，让我回到森林里去吧。”这时讨饭的女人把手放在他头上，对他说：“起来吧。”麻风病人也把手放在他头上，对他说：“起来吧。”","And he sobbed again and said: “Mother, my suffering is greater than I can bear.Give me thy forgiveness, and let me go back to the forest.”And the beggar-woman put her hand on his head, and said to him, “Rise,” and the leper put his hand on his head, and said to him, “Rise,” also."
"他站起身来，望着他们。瞧！原来他们正是国王和王后。","And he rose up from his feet, and looked at them, and lo! they were a King and a Queen."
"王后对他说：“这是你的父亲，你曾经救济过他。”国王说：“这是你的母亲，你曾用泪水洗过她的双脚。”接着他们搂住他的脖子，亲吻他，把他带进宫，让他穿上漂亮的衣服，戴上皇冠，握上权杖。从此他统治着坐落于河边的这座城市，成为它的主人。他极其公正、仁慈地对待所有人。他赶走了那个邪恶的魔术师，又送了丰厚的礼物给樵夫和他的妻子，还赐予他们的子女无上的荣耀。他禁止任何人虐待鸟兽，用爱心、仁慈、宽恕教导子民。他为食不果腹的穷人送去面包，为衣不蔽体的人送去衣服。在这片土地上呈现出一派和平昌盛的气象。","And the Queen said to him, “This is thy father whom thou hast succoured.” And the King said, “This is thy mother whose feet thou hast washed with thy tears.”And they fell on his neck and kissed him, and brought him into the palace and clothed him in fair raiment, and set the crown upon his head, and the sceptre in his hand, and over the city that stood by the river he ruled, and was its lord.Much justice and mercy did he show to all, and the evil Magician he banished, and to the Woodcutter and his wife he sent many rich gifts, and to their children he gave high honour.Nor would he suffer any to be cruel to bird or beast, but taught love and loving-kindness and charity, and to the poor he gave bread, and to the naked he gave raiment, and there was peace and plenty in the land."
"然而他统治的时间太短了，他遭受了巨大的痛苦，经历了辛酸磨难的考验，三年过后，他就去世了。而他的后继者却是一个暴君。","Yet ruled he not long, so great had been his suffering, and so bitter the fire of his testing, for after the space of three years he died.And he who came after him ruled evilly."
"结束。"," End."
