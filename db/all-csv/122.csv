"国王威廉三世的画像","Portrait of King William III"
"作者：马克·吐温","by Mark Twain "
"每看到《银河》杂志里的那些月刊画像，我都有一种狂热的、强烈的欲望，想要去当一名艺术家。我一生中看过无数的画像——有些是在这里，有些是在欧洲的画廊里——但是从来没有一幅画能像这些画像那样打动我。","I never can look at those periodical portraits in THE GALAXY magazine without feeling a wild, tempestuous ambition to be an artist.I have seen thousands and thousands of pictures in my time—acres of them here and leagues of them in the galleries of Europe—but never any that moved me as these portraits do."
"十一月刊里有一幅卡佩尔阁下的画像，如今能有什么比它更美好呢？还有，十月刊里有一幅俾斯麦的画像。在看这幅画像时，有谁能不为之感到自己更加纯洁、更加坚强、更加高尚呢？再者，九月刊里有瑟洛和威德的画像；没有看到它我是不会死去的，是的，无论这个世界能给予我什么，我都不会。但是再往前追溯，我记起我自己的画像出现在八月刊里；如果我的画像出来时，我已经在坟墓呆了一千年，我也会爬起来，去拜访那位艺术家。","There is a portrait of Monsignore Capel in the November number, now COULD anything be sweeter than that?And there was Bismarck’s, in the October number; who can look at that without being purer and stronger and nobler for it?And Thurlow and Weed’s picture in the September number; I would not have died without seeing that, no, not for anything this world can give.But looks back still further and recall my own likeness as printed in the August number; if I had been in my grave a thousand years when that appeared, I would have got up and visited the artist."
"每天晚上睡觉时，我都会把这些画像放在枕头底下，这样我才能在天一亮时继续研究它们。我对它们非常了解，就好像它们是我亲自绘制的似的；它们的每一个笔画、每一个标记我都知道。偶尔有其他人在时，我会匆忙收好这些画，之后再将它们一一拣出来，并点出它们的名字，无需参考底部的文字。我很少出错——在我冷静的时候，从不出错。","I sleep with all these portraits under my pillow every night, so that I can go on studying them as soon as the day dawns in the morning.I know them all as thoroughly as if I had made them myself; I know every line and mark about them.Sometimes when company are present I shuffle the portraits all up together, and then pick them out one by one and call their names, without referring to the printing on the bottom.I seldom make a mistake—never, when I am calm."
"很长时间以前，我就给这些画镶好了边框，就等我姑妈做好其他一切准备然后将它们悬挂到客厅里。但是先是一件事，再加上另一件事妨碍了这件事，于是这个事就耽搁了下来。她曾说过这些画应当放在阁楼里，这样它们就能得到更多它们需要的特殊光线。这个老傻瓜！那上面像坟墓一样黑暗。不过因为她对艺术一无所知，所以她对此就毫无敬意。在我向她展示我的《巴黎要塞图》时，她说这是垃圾。","I have had the portraits framed for a long time, waiting till my aunt gets everything ready for hanging them up in the parlor.But first one thing and then another interferes, and so the thing is delayed.Once she said they would have more of the peculiar kind of light they needed in the attic.The old simpleton!it is as dark as a tomb up there.But she does not know anything about art, and so she has no reverence for it.When I showed her my “Map of the Fortifications of Paris,” she said it was rubbish."
"那么，在我对这些画像上花了那么多心思之后，最后我对艺术完全着迷了。我现在有一名教师，而且随着我会使用的工具越来越多，如铅笔、笔刷和刻刀等，我的热情也持续激烈地增加。我正在师从德梅尔维尔，他为房屋刷漆，也为肖像作画。（他在西部生活时名叫史密斯。）他像米开朗琪罗一样多才多艺，能够从事人们要求的任何一种艺术工作。实际上，他长得也很像那位伟大的艺术家。他的后脑袋勺就很像米开朗琪罗，他戴帽子时，会把帽边压低到鼻子部位，好让后脑勺暴露出来。","Well, from nursing those portraits so long, I have come at last to have a perfect infatuation for art.I have a teacher now, and my enthusiasm continually and tumultuously grows, as I learn to use with more and more facility the pencil, brush, and graver.I am studying under De Mellville, the house and portrait painter.(His name was Smith when he lived in the West.) He does any kind of artist work a body wants, having a genius that is universal, like Michael Angelo.Resembles that great artist, in fact.The back of his head is like his, and he wears his hat-brim tilted down on his nose to expose it."
"现在，我已经跟随德梅尔维尔学习了好几个月了。第一个月我漆栅栏，成果还让人满意。第二个月我将畜棚刷白。第三个月，我在刷锡皮屋顶；第四个月，我在刷常见的标志；第五个月，我在刷立在雪茄店前的雕像。这个月只是第六个月，而我已经在画画像了！","I have been studying under De Mellville several months now.The first month I painted fences, and gave general satisfaction.The next month I white-washed a barn.The third, I was doing tin roofs; the forth, common signs; the fifth, statuary to stand before cigar shops.This present month is only the sixth, and I am already in portraits!"
"这幅粗陋的作品——普鲁士国王威廉三世陛下的画像——是我尝试的第五幅画像，也取得了最大的成功。这幅作品也获得了诸多评价（见附录）。它得到社会各界的高度赞美，但是最令我高兴的是，人们普遍并诚恳地认为它像《银河》里的画像。那些作品是我的最爱，我最初的崇拜，也是我艺术抱负最根本的源泉和动力。如今，无论我在艺术上取得何等成就，我都将之归功于这些画像。我不要求别人赞赏自己——这不是我应得的。而且我也从未居功。许多陌生人来我的展厅（因为我将我画的威廉国王的画像展示了出来，参观票价是一美元）。如果我让参观者在他离开时赞美我的话，他就会向我美言几句，但我从来都没这样做。我不断声明我是从哪里得到这个想法的。","The humble offering which accompanies these remarks (see figure)—the portrait of his Majesty William III., King of Prussia—is my fifth attempt in portraits, and my greatest success.It has received unbounded praise from all classes of the community, but that which gratifies me most is the frequent and cordial verdict that it resembles THE GALAXY portraits.Those were my first love, my earliest admiration, the original source and incentive of my art-ambition.Whatever I am in Art today, I owe to these portraits.I ask no credit for myself—I deserve none.And I never take any, either.Many a stranger has come to my exhibition (for I have had my portrait of King William on exhibition at one dollar a ticket), and would have gone away blessing me, if I had let him, but I never did.I always stated where I got the idea."
"威廉国王长着粗大茂密的络腮胡须，一些评论家认为，如果添加上络腮胡须的话，这幅画像会变得更加完整。但这是不可能的。因为没有能同时容下络腮胡和肩章的空间，所以，为了保持风格，我没有画胡须，而是画上了肩章。他帽子上那个东西是一只鹰。普鲁士雄鹰——这是一个国徽。我看到的帽子其实是头盔，如果在一幅画像里画进头盔的话，似乎没有一个躯体能有信心与之匹配。","King William wears large bushy side-whiskers, and some critics have thought that this portrait would be more complete if they were added.But it was not possible.There was not room for side-whiskers and epaulets both, and so I let the whiskers go, and put in the epaulets, for the sake of style.That thing on his hat is an eagle.The Prussian eagle—it is a national emblem.When I saw hat I mean helmet; but it seems impossible to make a picture of a helmet that a body can have confidence in."
"我希望，各地好心的朋友能够协助我，让大家能多关注一下《银河》中的画像。我坚信这是可以实现的，只要所采取的途径是经过判断之后得来的。我一直为那家杂志撰稿，许多比我有能力的人也这样做。如果我能让这些画像受到大家的喜爱，这就是我所追求的一切；阅读的事情会自行解决。","I wish kind friends everywhere would aid me in my endeavor to attract a little attention to THE GALAXY portraits.I feel persuaded it can be accomplished, if the course to be pursued be chosen with judgment.I write for that magazine all the time, and so do many abler men, and if I can get these portraits into universal favor, it is all I ask; the reading-matter will take care of itself."
