"A Fable","寓言一则"
"by Mark Twain","作者：马克·吐温"
"Once upon a time an artist who had painted a small and very beautiful picture placed it so that he could see it in the mirror.","从前，有一位画家，他画了一幅小巧而精美的画，他将其放在从镜子里可以看到的地方。"
"He said, “This doubles the distance and softens it, and it is twice as lovely as it was before.”","他说：“这样，距离就延长了一倍，可以使画面看起来更柔和，它就有先前的两倍那么可爱啦。”"
"The animals out in the woods heard of this through the housecat, who was greatly admired by them because he was so learned, and so refined and civilized, and so polite and high-bred, and could tell them so much which they didn’t know before, and were not certain about afterward.","森林里的动物们从家猫那里得知了这一消息。这只家猫很受动物们的崇拜，因为他是那么博学，那么优雅和文明，那么有礼貌和有高度教养，他能告诉他们那么多他们以前不知道的，而且以后肯定也不会知道的事情。"
"They were much excited about this new piece of gossip, and they asked questions, so as to get at a full understanding of it.","他们对这新一轮的闲谈感到非常激动，他们问了很多问题，以便对这件事情有个全面的了解。"
"They asked what a picture was, and the cat explained.","他们问什么是图画，家猫作了解释。"
"“It is a flat thing,” he said; “wonderfully flat, marvelously flat, enchantingly flat and elegant.","“那是一块平平的东西，”他说，“出奇地平，不可思议地平，迷人又高雅地平。"
"And, oh, so beautiful!”","啊，多么美丽啊！”"
"That excited them almost to a frenzy, and they said they would give the world to see it.","这让动物们兴奋到几乎要发狂了，他们说要让全世界的动物都看到它。"
"Then the bear asked:","然后，熊问道："
"“What is it that makes it so beautiful?”","“是什么让它这么漂亮的啊？”"
"“It is the looks of it,” said the cat.","“是它的外表。”家猫说。"
"This filled them with admiration and uncertainty, and they were more excited than ever.","这让他们心中充满了羡慕和半信半疑，他们比之前更加激动了。"
"Then the cow asked:","接着母牛问："
"“What is a mirror?”","“镜子是什么？”"
"“It is a hole in the wall,” said the cat.","“它是墙上的一个洞，”家猫说，"
"“You look in it, and there you see the picture, and it is so dainty and charming and ethereal and inspiring in its unimaginable beauty that your head turns round and round, and you almost swoon with ecstasy.”","“你向里面看去，就会看到一幅画，那幅画是那么漂亮，那么迷人，那么扑朔迷离，你会被它那不可思议的美迷得神魂颠倒，你会狂喜得几乎晕过去。”"
"The ass had not said anything as yet; he now began to throw doubts.","到现在为止，驴子都没有说过一句话，他现在也开始产生怀疑了。"
"He said there had never been anything as beautiful as this before, and probably wasn’t now.","他说，以前从没看过任何东西有这么漂亮，很可能现在也没有。"
"He said that when it took a whole basketful of sesquipedalian adjectives to whoop up a thing of beauty, it was time for suspicion.","他说，每当有人用一大篮筐冗长的形容词来赞扬一个东西漂亮时，这就是值得怀疑的时候了。"
"It was easy to see that these doubts were having an effect upon the animals, so the cat went off offended.","很容易看出，这种怀疑在动物们那里产生了影响，于是家猫生气地走开了。"
"The subject was dropped for a couple of days, but in the meantime curiosity was taking a fresh start, aid there was a revival of interest perceptible.","这个话题就停了一两天，但与此同时，动物们的好奇心又重新萌动起来，能察觉到兴趣又复活了。"
"Then the animals assailed the ass for spoiling what could possibly have been a pleasure to them, on a mere suspicion that the picture was not beautiful, without any evidence that such was the case.","于是动物们纷纷责怪驴子破坏了很可能属于他们的乐趣，仅仅凭借一丝怀疑，他就认定那幅画不美，这是毫无依据的。"
"The ass was not, troubled; he was calm, and said there was one way to find out who was in the right, himself or the cat: he would go and look in that hole, and come back and tell what he found there.","驴子没有因此而焦虑，相反，他很平静。他说，有一个办法可以证明他自己和那只家猫谁对谁错。他会到那里朝那个洞里看一看，然后回来告诉大家他在那里发现了什么。"
"The animals felt relieved and grateful, and asked him to go at once—which he did.","动物们顿时释然，心怀感激，催他赶快去——他就马上去了。"
"But he did not know where he ought to stand; and so, through error, he stood between the picture and the mirror.","但是，他不知道他该站在哪里。所以，他错误地站在了那幅画和镜子中间。"
"The result was that the picture had no chance, and didn’t show up.","结果是那幅画无法显示出来。"
"He returned home and said:","他回到家里说："
"“The cat lied.","“那家猫撒谎了。"
"There was nothing in that hole but an ass.","那洞里压根儿就没有什么画，只有一头驴子。"
"There wasn’t a sign of a flat thing visible.","而且也没看到有一块平平的东西的迹象。"
"It was a handsome ass, and friendly, but just an ass, and nothing more.”","只有一头帅气友好的驴子，但只有一头驴子，没有别的什么了。”"
"The elephant asked:","大象问道："
"“Did you see it good and clear?","“你仔细看清楚了吗？"
"Were you close to it?”","你凑近看了吗？”"
"“I saw it good and clear, O Hathi, King of Beasts.","“我仔细看清楚了，啊，哈蒂，百兽之王。"
"I was so close that I touched noses with it.”","我凑得那么近，以至于我的鼻子都碰到它了。”"
"“This is very strange,” said the elephant; “the cat was always truthful before—as far as we could make out.","“这真是奇怪极了，”大象说，“那家猫以前一直很诚实的——据我们了解。"
"Let another witness try.","让另外一个证人去试一试吧。"
"Go, Baloo, look in the hole, and come and report.”","巴卢，你去吧，往那个洞里瞧一瞧，然后回来报告。”"
"So the bear went.","于是，那只熊去了。"
"When he came back, he said:","他回来说道："
"“Both the cat and the ass have lied; there was nothing in the hole but a bear.”","“那家猫和驴子都撒谎了，那洞里什么都没有，只有一只熊而已。”"
"Great was the surprise and puzzlement of the animals.","动物们都大吃一惊，疑惑不已。"
"Each was now anxious to make the test himself and get at the straight truth.","他们每一个都急切地想去亲自看看，一探究竟。"
"The elephant sent them one at a time.","大象于是派他们一个一个地去看。"
"First, the cow.","首先是母牛。"
"She found nothing in the hole but a cow.","她在洞里什么都没发现，只有一头母牛。"
"The tiger found nothing in it but a tiger.","老虎在洞里什么都没看到，只有一只老虎。"
"The lion found nothing in it but a lion.","狮子在洞里什么都没看见，只有一只狮子。"
"The leopard found nothing in it but a leopard.","豹子在里面只发现了一只豹子，其他的什么都没有。"
"The camel found a camel, and nothing more.","骆驼只看到一只骆驼，再没有别的什么了。"
"Then Hathi was wroth, and said he would have the truth, if he had to go and fetch it himself.","于是哈蒂勃然大怒，说他非得亲自去一趟不可，他一定要找出真相。"
"When he returned, he abused his whole subjectry for liars, and was in an unappeasable fury with the moral and mental blindness of the cat.","他回来的时候，大骂他所有的臣民们都是骗子，并且对家猫表示难以抑制的愤怒，因为他在道德和智力方面真是糊涂至极。"
"He said that anybody but a near-sighted fool could see that there was nothing in the hole but an elephant.","他说，除了近视的傻子，任何人都可以看到，那洞里除了一头大象外没别的什么啊。"
"MORAL, BY THE CAT","家猫所作的教训"
"You can find in a text whatever you bring, if you will stand between it and the mirror of your imagination.","你们能从此文里领悟到，不论你们带着一样什么东西，如果你们站在它和你们想象中的镜子之间："
"You may not see your ears, but they will be there.","你们可能看不见你们的耳朵，但他们仍然还是在那里。"
