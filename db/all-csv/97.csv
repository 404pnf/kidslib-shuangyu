"哈里发和莽汉","The Caliph and the Cad"
"作者：欧·亨利","by O. Henry"
"毫无疑问，没有什么消遣比隐姓埋名地与那些有钱有身份的人混在一起更有趣的了。只有在那些圈子里，你才能摆脱约束底层居民的社会习俗，看到处在原始的、自然状态下的生活。","Surely there is no pastime more diverting than that of mingling, incognito, with persons of wealth and station.Where else but in those circles can one see life in its primitive, crude state unhampered by the conventions that bind the dwellers in a lower sphere?"
"巴格达的某个哈里发总是出入于那些穷人和下等人中间，目的是从他们叙述的传说和历史故事中获得慰藉。一个身份低微、穷困潦倒的人却总是戴着钻石、穿着锦缎绸衣、在上流社会的人经常出入的地方扮演哈里发，以从中获取乐趣，这难道不奇怪吗？","There was a certain Caliph of Bagdad who was accustomed to go down among the poor and lowly for the solace obtained from the relation of their tales and histories.Is it not strange that the humble and poverty-stricken have not availed themselves of the pleasure they might glean by donning diamonds and silks and playing Caliph among the haunts of the upper world?"
"就有这么一个人就看到了成功反击哈伦·赖世德的各种可能性。这个人叫康尼·布兰尼根，他是运河街一家进口公司的运货马车的车夫。如果你接着读下去，你就会知道他是怎样把繁华的百老汇大道变成巴格达的，并且了解到他以前都不知道的、关于他自己的事情。","There was one who saw the possibilities of thus turning the tables on Haroun al Raschid.His name was Corny Brannigan, and he was a truck driver for a Canal Street importing firm.And if you read further you will learn how he turned upper Broadway into Bagdad and learned something about himself that he did not know before."
"很多人都会说康尼是个势利小人——人们更喜欢在电话里骂他。他生活中的主要乐趣、他所选择的娱乐方式，以及他工作之余的唯一消遣就是能同有名望的、有财富的人平起平坐——由于他不指望能加入到他们行列中去。","Many people would have called Corny a snob—preferably by means of a telephone.His chief interest in life, his chosen amusement, and his sole diversion after working hours, was to place himself in juxtaposition—since he could not hope to mingle—with people of fashion and means."
"每天晚上，收好车马并在一家小快餐店里吃完饭之后，康尼就穿上他的晚礼服，那礼服和你在任何一个高档次场合看到的礼服一样端庄。然后，他就会前往那令人销魂的、灯光四射的街道，这条街很是热衷于泰斯庇斯、泰伊思和巴克斯。","Every evening after Corny had put up his team and dined at a lunch-counter that made immediateness a specialty, he would clothe himself in evening raiment as correct as any you will see in the palm rooms.Then he would betake himself to that ravishing, radiant roadway devoted to Thespis, Thais, and Bacchus."
"他会在最高档的宾馆大厅里闲逛一阵子，心灵沉浸在幸福的满足中。漂亮的女人在他身旁走过时，她们的礼服微微地触碰他，她们说话如鸽子般温声细语，而穿着就像天堂的鸟儿。彬彬有礼的绅士们围着她们打转，争先恐后地向她们献殷勤。康尼的心如兰斯洛特先生的心一样骄傲，因为当他经过一面镜子的时候，镜子对他说道：“康尼，老兄，他们所有人中没有谁比你看起来更时髦的了。你赶一辆运货马车，他们却不用缴税，在画廊里花高价收集国内最好的艺术品。”","For a time he would stroll about the lobbies of the best hotels, his soul steeped in blissful content.Beautiful women, cooing like doves, but feathered like birds of Paradise, flicked him with their robes as they passed.Courtly gentlemen attended them, gallant and assiduous.And Corny’s heart within him swelled like Sir Lancelot’s, for the mirror spoke to him as he passed and said: “Corny, lad, there’s not a guy among ’em that looks a bit the sweller than yerself.And you drivin’ of a truck and them swearin’ off their taxes and playin’ the red in art galleries with the best in the land!”"
"镜子说的是事实。康尼·布兰尼根先生即使不具备其他东西，也至少拥有了光鲜的外表。由于长期以来细心观察上流社会的人，他学会了他们的行为举止和和温文尔雅的样子——最为难得的是——那种从容和安适。","And the mirrors spake the truth.Mr. Corny Brannigan had acquired the outward polish, if nothing more.Long and keen observation of polite society had gained for him its manner, its genteel air, and—most difficult of acquirement—its repose and ease."
"有时康尼会偶尔结识一些在酒店里出入的客人，与他们聊上几句。那些人就算不是成就卓著，也是家道殷实。他和他们中的很多人都交换了名片，他把他收到的名片小心地保存起来，以备日后自己使用。走出宾馆的大厅，康尼会在剧院门口悠闲地散一会儿步，顺便进入一家时尚餐厅，装作找朋友的样子。他不经常光顾这些地方，他不是来这里采蜜的蜜蜂，而是一只在花朵间拍打翅膀的蝴蝶，这些花的花萼上没有为他准备甜蜜。他的工资也就够买一件稍微像样的绅士外套，其他啥也买不起了。要想成为他如此熟练效仿的那群人中的一员，康尼·布兰尼根就要多结识一些人。","Now and then in the hotels Corny had managed conversation and temporary acquaintance with substantial, if not distinguished, guests.With many of these he had exchanged cards, and the ones he received he carefully treasured for his own use later.Leaving the hotel lobbies, Corny would stroll leisurely about, lingering at the theatre entrance, dropping into the fashionable restaurants as if seeking some friend.He rarely patronized any of these places; he was no bee come to suck honey, but a butterfly flashing his wings among the flowers whose calyces held no sweets for him.His wages were not large enough to furnish him with more than the outside garb of the gentleman.To have been one of the beings he so cunningly imitated, Corny Brannigan would have given his right hand."
"一天晚上，康尼经历了一段奇遇。在百老汇几家大酒店的休息室里愉快地度过一个小时后，他来到了泰斯庇斯的大本营。让他觉得自豪且满意的是出租车司机们以为他可能会乘车，纷纷向他打招呼。司机们向他投去渴望的眼神，寄盼着他给的钱能让他们买得起龙虾和美味的香槟酒。康尼把这些友好的姿态和下意识的恭维作为精神食粮来消化，希望那匹病马比尔的左前腿明天早上能不那么跛了。","One night Corny had an adventure.After absorbing the delights of an hour’s lounging in the principal hotels along Broadway, he passed up into the stronghold of Thespis.Cab drivers hailed him as a likely fare, to his prideful content.Languishing eyes were turned upon him as a hopeful source of lobsters and the delectable, ascendant globules of effervescence.These overtures and unconscious compliments Corny swallowed as manna, and hoped Bill, the off horse, would be less lame in the left forefoot in the morning."
"在一束乳白色的电灯灯光下，康尼停下来欣赏他低帮漆皮皮鞋的光泽。拐角的建筑是一家奢华的咖啡馆。从咖啡馆出来一对男女，女士穿着蛛网面的白色晚礼服，围着一条蕾丝围巾，像是萦绕在脖子上的一圈薄雾；男士身材高大、完美无缺、非常自信——太过自信了。他们走到人行道边，停了下来。康尼的眼睛向来对“举止高贵优雅”的“标杆性人物”非常敏感，他一直在观察着，眼睛不断地瞟向他们。","Beneath a cluster of milky globes of electric light Corny paused to admire the sheen of his low-cut patent leather shoes.The building occupying the angle was a pretentious café.Out of this came a couple, a lady in a white, cobwebby evening gown, with a lace wrap like a wreath of mist thrown over it, and a man, tall, faultless, assured—too assured.They moved to the edge of the sidewalk and halted.Corny’s eye, ever alert for “pointers” in “swell” behaviour, took them in with a sidelong glance."
"“马车不在这儿，”女士说道，“你让他在这儿等了吗？”","“The carriage is not here,” said the lady.“You ordered it to wait?”"
"“我让他九点半到这儿，”那个男子说，“现在应该到这儿了的。”","“I ordered it for nine-thirty,” said the man.“It should be here now.”"
"女士声音的调子听起来有些熟悉，这更引起了康尼的特殊注意。他对这种讲话的语调非常熟悉。柔和的电灯光照在她的脸上。与伤心类似的感情是无处可藏的。在心碎之书的索引中，你会发现百老汇的位置仅次于鲍厄里街。这个女士的脸沉了下来，声音也随之而变。他们在那里等着，像是在等马车。康尼也在等，因为是在户外，他对积累汲取绅士举止的知识从不会厌倦。","A familiar note in the lady’s voice drew a more especial attention from Corny.It was pitched in a key well known to him.The soft electric shone upon her face.Sisters of sorrow have no quarters fixed for them.In the index to the book of breaking hearts you will find that Broadway follows very soon after the Bowery.This lady’s face was sad, and her voice was attuned with it.They waited, as if for the carriage.Corny waited too, for it was out of doors, and he was never tired of accumulating and profiting by knowledge of gentlemanly conduct."
"“杰克，”女子说道，“别生气。今天晚上我已经尽我所能来取悦你了。你为什么还这样呢？”","“Jack,” said the lady, “don’t be angry.I’ve done everything I could to please you this evening.Why do you act so?”"
"“噢，你真善良，”男子说道，“要女人来指责男人。”","“Oh, you’re an angel,” said the man.“Depend upon woman to throw the blame upon a man.”"
"“我没有责备你。我只是想使你快乐。”","“I’m not blaming you.I’m only trying to make you happy.”"
"“那你做事的方式还真是与众不同。”","“You go about it in a very peculiar way.”"
"“你整晚都在毫无缘由地和我怄气。”","“You have been cross with me all the evening without any cause.”"
"“噢，除了你令我很烦以外——还真没什么理由。”","“Oh, there isn’t any cause except—you make me tired.”"
"康尼拿出他的名片夹，浏览了一下他收集的名片。他挑出了一张，上面写着：“R. 莱昂内尔·怀特·梅尔维尔先生，伦敦布鲁姆斯伯里广场。”这张名片是他从爱德华国王宾馆的一名旅客那里骗来的。康尼走近了那个男子，正式得体地把它交给了他。","Corny took out his card case and looked over his collection.He selected one that read: “Mr. R. Lionel Whyte-Melville, Bloomsbury Square, London.”This card he had inveigled from a tourist at the King Edward Hotel.Corny stepped up to the man and presented it with a correctly formal air."
"“请问，为何我能有幸被选中？”女子的男伴问。","“May I ask why I am selected for the honour?” asked the lady’s escort."
"康尼·布莱尼根先生在模仿巴格达的哈里发时已经养成了一个非常明智的习惯，就是少说话。查斯特菲特勋爵的忠告：“穿一件黑色外套并管住你的嘴，”虽然他没亲耳听过，他还是相信。但现在他必须得说话了。","Now, Mr. Corny Brannigan had a very wise habit of saying little during his imitations of the Caliph of Bagdad.The advice of Lord Chesterfield: “Wear a black coat and hold your tongue,” he believed in without having heard.But now speech was demanded and required of him."
"“没有绅士，”康尼说道，“会像您那样对女士说话的。呸，威利！即使她是你的妻子，你也应该对你自己的身份有所尊重，而不应那样责骂她。也许这与我无关，但无论怎样——你完全错误的行为使我惊讶。”","“No gent,” said Corny, “would talk to a lady like you done.Fie upon you, Willie!Even if she happens to be your wife you ought to have more respect for your clothes than to chin her back that way.Maybe it ain’t my butt-in, but it goes, anyhow—you strike me as bein’ a whole lot to the wrong.”"
"女子的男伴反驳，很机智、优雅，也很吸引人。康尼极力避免使用与他货车司机身份相匹配的词汇，所以他尽量用礼貌的措辞回敬。康尼极力避免使用与他货车司机身份相匹配的词汇，所以他尽量用礼貌的措辞回敬。","The lady’s escort indulged in more elegantly expressed but fetching repartee.Corny, eschewing his truck driver’s vocabulary, retorted as nearly as he could in polite phrases.Then diplomatic relations were severed; there was a brief but lively set-to with other than oral weapons, from which Corny came forth easily victor."
"一辆马车驶来，驾车的车夫显得行动迟缓、忧心忡忡。","A carriage dashed up, driven by a tardy and solicitous coachman."
"“能劳驾您帮我把门打开吗？”女子问道。康尼协助她进去后，脱下帽子。男伴在人行道上开始爬了起来。","“Will you kindly open the door for me?” asked the lady.Corny assisted her to enter, and took off his hat.The escort was beginning to scramble up from the sidewalk."
"“女士，请允许我问一下，”康尼说道，“他是您的丈夫吗？”","“I beg your pardon, ma’am,” said Corny, “if he’s your man.”"
"“他不是我丈夫，”女子说道，“也许他——但现在他已经没有机会了。驾车回家，迈克尔。希望您能收下这个——以及我的谢意。”","“He’s no man of mine,” said the lady.“Perhaps he—but there’s no chance of his being now.Drive home, Michael.If you care to take this—with my thanks.”"
"三朵红玫瑰从车窗里被推出来，落到康尼的手中。他接过那些玫瑰，还握了一下手，然后马车飞奔离开了。","Three red roses were thrust out through the carriage window into Corny’s hand.He took them, and the hand for an instant; and then the carriage sped away."
"康尼捡起他那对手的帽子，并抖了抖他衣服上的灰。","Corny gathered his foe’s hat and began to brush the dust from his clothes."
"“一起走吧。”康尼说，拽着那男人的手臂。","“Come along,” said Corny, taking the other man by the arm."
"他的前任对手刚才挨了几计重拳，还有点儿眩晕。康尼小心地把他扶进了不远的一个酒馆。","His late opponent was yet a little dazed by the hard knocks he had received.Corny led him carefully into a saloon three doors away."
"“两杯酒，”康尼说，“给我和我的朋友。”","“The drinks for us,” said Corny, “me and my friend.”"
"“你真是个奇怪的家伙，”女子的前任男伴说道，“打了我一顿，现在又来讨好我。”","“You’re a queer feller,” said the lady’s late escort—“lick a man and then want to set ’em up.”"
"“你是我最好的朋友，”康尼眉飞色舞地说，“你还不明白？那好，听着。你刚才使我明白了一些事。我一直在扮演绅士，我以为，除了我拥有的高贵礼服，我一无所有。喂——你也是个上流人士，不是吗？我猜，你在上流社会一定混得很好。我不是，但我现在发现一件事——我是一个绅士，通过——反正我现在知道了。你要喝点儿什么？”","“You’re my best friend,” said Corny exultantly.“You don’t understand?Well, listen.You just put me wise to somethin’.I been playin’ gent a long time, thinkin’ it was just the glad rags I had and nothin’ else.Say—you’re a swell, ain’t you?Well, you trot in that class, I guess.I don’t; but I found out one thing—I’m a gentleman, by—and I know it now.What’ll you have to drink?”"
