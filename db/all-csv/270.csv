"作者：纳撒尼尔·霍桑","by Nathaniell Hawthorn"
"薄暮时分，年轻的古德曼·布朗（英文意为“好人”）一脚迈入塞勒姆村的街巷，却在跨出门槛后又转过头去吻别他年轻的妻子。而费丝（英文意为“信仰”），他人如其名的妻子，也把她美丽的脸探到街上；与丈夫话别时，晚风吹拂着她帽子上的粉色缎带。","Young Goodman Brown came forth at sunset into the street at Salem village; but put his head back, after crossing the threshold, to exchange a parting kiss with his young wife.And Faith, as the wife was aptly named, thrust her own pretty head into the street, letting the wind play with the pink ribbons of her cap while she called to Goodman Brown."
"“我最亲爱的，”她将双唇靠向他的耳边，温柔甚至略带伤感地悄语，“求你将行程推迟到日出之后吧，今夜请在自己的床上安眠。一个孤独的女人有时会被梦境与思绪困扰而自生忧惧。亲爱的丈夫，一年之中，只求你今夜留在我身边。”","“Dearest heart,” whispered she, softly and rather sadly, when her lips were close to his ear, “prithee put off your journey until sunrise and sleep in your own bed to-night.A lone woman is troubled with such dreams and such thoughts that she’s afeard of herself sometimes.Pray tarry with me this night, dear husband, of all nights in the year.”"
"“费丝，我的爱，”年轻的古德曼·布朗答道，“在这一年的所有夜晚中，只有今夜我必须离你而去。我的行程，依你的叫法，必在此夜结束，天亮前就得回返。怎么，我甜美可爱的妻，你我不过新婚三月，难道你已对我存疑？”","“My love and my Faith,” replied young Goodman Brown, “of all nights in the year, this one night must I tarry away from thee.My journey, as thou callest it, forth and back again, must needs be done ’twixt now and sunrise.What, my sweet, pretty wife, dost thou doubt me already, and we but three months married?”"
"“那么愿上帝保佑你！”费丝说道，戴着那条粉色缎带，“愿你归来时一切都好。”","“Then God bless you!” said Faith, with the pink ribbons; “and may you find all well when you come back.”"
"“阿门！”古德曼·布朗朗声说道，“祈祷吧，亲爱的费丝，在黑夜来临时入睡，就没有什么能伤害到你了。”","“Amen!” cried Goodman Brown.“Say thy prayers, dear Faith, and go to bed at dusk, and no harm will come to thee.”"
"于是他们分别了。年轻人循路而行，直到将要转过礼拜堂前的拐角才回过头去，只见费丝的目光仍追随着他，连她佩戴的粉色缎带都无法遮饰她忧郁的神情。","So they parted; and the young man pursued his way until, being about to turn the corner by the meeting-house, he looked back and saw the head of Faith still peeping after him with a melancholy air, in spite of her pink ribbons."
"“小可怜费丝！”他想，心脏猛烈地撞击着，“因为这种事离她而去，我简直就是一个混蛋！她还提到了梦境。当她说起，我在她的脸上觉察到困扰，仿佛曾有梦警示给她我今夜的行动。但是，不，不。这种念头会将她折磨死的。哦，她是蒙恩的凡间天使。今夜之后，我将攀住她的裙角，随她步向天堂。”","“Poor little Faith!” thought he, for his heart smote him.“What a wretch am I to leave her on such an errand!She talks of dreams, too.Methought as she spoke there was trouble in her face, as if a dream had warned her what work is to be done tonight.But no, no; ’t would kill her to think it.Well, she’s a blessed angel on earth; and after this one night I’ll cling to her skirts and follow her to heaven.”"
"由于对未来抱定了决心，古德曼·布朗觉得即便为他现在的邪恶目的加快脚步也情有可原。他选择的是一条荒凉的道路，由于林中最阴森的树木遮蔽而变得昏暗；树木仅容狭窄的小路勉强蜿蜒穿过，随即又再次聚拢。这真是再孤寂不过了。这样的荒芜之处尽皆如此，在那无数的树干与头顶的粗枝之后，行人无从知晓可能隐藏了什么；也许，他孤独的脚步正穿行在看不见的人群之中。","With this excellent resolve for the future, Goodman Brown felt himself justified in making more haste on his present evil purpose.He had taken a dreary road, darkened by all the gloomiest trees of the forest, which barely stood aside to let the narrow path creep through, and closed immediately behind.It was all as lonely as could be; and there is this peculiarity in such a solitude, that the traveller knows not who may be concealed by the innumerable trunks and the thick boughs overhead; so that with lonely footsteps he may yet be passing through an unseen multitude."
"“也许每棵树后都藏有一个凶恶的印第安人，”古德曼·布朗自语着。他畏惧地向身后扫了一眼，补充道：“说不定此刻在我身畔的正是魔鬼本人！”","“There may be a devilish Indian behind every tree,” said Goodman Brown to himself; and he glanced fearfully behind him as he added, “What if the devil himself should be at my very elbow!”"
"他扭头向后，走过一个转弯；当他转过头来，只见一个衣着庄重体面的男人正坐在一棵古树脚下。古德曼·布朗走近之后，那人便站起身，同他一起并肩前行。","His head being turned back, he passed a crook of the road, and, looking forward again, beheld the figure of a man, in grave and decent attire, seated at the foot of an old tree.He arose at Goodman Brown’s approach and walked onward side by side with him."
"“你来迟了，古德曼·布朗。”他说，“老南方的钟声在我经过波士顿时便敲响了，而今已足足过去十五分钟了。”","“You are late, Goodman Brown,” said he.“The clock of the Old South was striking as I came through Boston, and that is full fifteen minutes agone.”"
"“被费丝耽搁了一会儿。”虽然他同伴的出现并非全在意料之外，但由于来得突然，年轻人答话的声音仍有些微微发颤。","“Faith kept me back a while,” replied the young man, with a tremor in his voice, caused by the sudden appearance of his companion, though not wholly unexpected."
"此刻林中夜色已深，而他们二人正行走在最幽暗的地方。差不多可以看出，这第二个人约有五十岁上下，显然与古德曼·布朗同等的阶层出身，并且与他相当相像。尽管这种相似也许更多的是在神情而非容貌上。他们仍然很可能会被看作是父子。但是，尽管长者同年轻人衣着一样朴素，行事也一样简捷，他却拥有一种难以描摹的、通晓世事的态度。假使由于某些事务而必须前往州长的宴席或是威廉国王的宫廷，他也绝不会陷入窘境。但他的手杖却是他身上唯一引人注目的东西，像极了一条巨大的黑蛇，锻铸得匪夷所思，看起来几乎能够如一条活生生的蛇一般蜷曲、蠕动。当然，这必是在飘忽不定的光线影响下，眼睛受到的欺骗。","It was now deep dusk in the forest, and deepest in that part of it where these two were journeying.As nearly as could be discerned, the second traveller was about fifty years old, apparently in the same rank of life as Goodman Brown, and bearing a considerable resemblance to him, though perhaps more in expression than features.Still they might have been taken for father and son.And yet, though the elder person was as simply clad as the younger, and as simple in manner too, he had an indescribable air of one who knew the world, and who would not have felt abashed at the governor’s dinner table or in King William’s court, were it possible that his affairs should call him thither.But the only thing about him that could be fixed upon as remarkable was his staff, which bore the likeness of a great black snake, so curiously wrought that it might almost be seen to twist and wriggle itself like a living serpent.This, of course, must have been an ocular deception, assisted by the uncertain light."
"“快啊，古德曼·布朗，”他的同行者叫道，“以这种速度开始一段行程也太闷人了。如果你这么快感到疲劳，就拿上我的手杖吧。”","“Come, Goodman Brown,” cried his fellow-traveller, “this is a dull pace for the beginning of a journey.Take my staff, if you are so soon weary.”"
"“朋友，”另一人干脆止住了他缓慢的步子，说道，“我已如约来此见你，现在我决意原路返回。对于接触你所熟悉的事物我仍心存疑虑。”","“Friend,” said the other, exchanging his slow pace for a full stop, “having kept covenant by meeting thee here, it is my purpose now to return whence I came.I have scruples touching the matter thou wot’st of.”"
"“此话当真？”蛇杖主人从旁笑道，“我们不妨前行，边走边聊；如果我将你说服，你便无需回返。我们不过才在林中走了一小段路。”","“Sayest thou so?” replied he of the serpent, smiling apart.“Let us walk on, nevertheless, reasoning as we go; and if I convince thee not thou shalt turn back.We are but a little way in the forest yet.”"
"“够远了！够远了！”这个好小伙子嚷道，不自觉地又迈开了脚步。“我的父亲从未因为这种事进入这片丛林，在他之前，他的父亲也未曾如此。我们家族自殉道者时代起便都是老实本分、笃信上帝之人，难道要我做布朗家第一个走上这条道路的人，而且还跟——”","“Too far! too far!” exclaimed the goodman, unconsciously resuming his walk.“My father never went into the woods on such an errand, nor his father before him.We have been a race of honest men and good Christians since the days of the martyrs; and shall I be the first of the name of Brown that ever took this path and kept—”"
"“这种人在一起。你是要这么说吧。”年长者觉察到他未曾出口的话，接了他的话茬。“说得好，古德曼·布朗！我同你的家人早已熟识，就如我熟悉任何一个清教家庭一样，这可绝非虚言。你祖父还在做治安官的时候，一次他在萨勒姆的街巷间狠命鞭打那个贵格女教徒，是我帮了他的忙；在菲利普国王之战中，是我从自己的壁炉内点燃一个油松火把带给你的父亲，放火烧了一座印第安村落。他们是我的好友，二人都是；曾有多少次我们漫步在这条小路上，直至午夜之后才兴尽而返。看在他们的情面上，我乐于与你为友。”","“Such company, thou wouldst say,” observed the elder person, interpreting his pause.“Well said, Goodman Brown!I have been as well acquainted with your family as with ever a one among the Puritans; and that’s no trifle to say.I helped your grandfather, the constable, when he lashed the Quaker woman so smartly through the streets of Salem; and it was I that brought your father a pitch-pine knot, kindled at my own hearth, to set fire to an Indian village, in King Philip’s war.They were my good friends, both; and many a pleasant walk have we had along this path, and returned merrily after midnight.I would fain be friends with you for their sake.”"
"“若真如你所言，”古德曼·布朗答道，“我奇怪为何他们从未提及此事。不过，实话说我倒不觉得诧异，因为哪怕一丁点儿类似的谣言就足以将他们逐出新英格兰。我们家族的人都是规矩的基督徒，此外还行善积德，绝对做不出此等恶行。”","“If it be as thou sayest,” replied Goodman Brown, “I marvel they never spoke of these matters; or, verily, I marvel not, seeing that the least rumor of the sort would have driven them from New England.We are a people of prayer, and good works to boot, and abide no such wickedness.”"
"“不管算不算恶行。”手执扭曲拐杖的行者说，“我在新英格兰这里认识很多人。许多教堂的执事都同我一起饮过圣餐酒；许多城镇的管理委员会都认命我担任他们的主席；马萨诸塞州议会里的大多数议员也都坚定地支持我所喜欢的事。州长跟我也——不过这些就是国家机密了。”","“Wickedness or not,” said the traveller with the twisted staff, “I have a very general acquaintance here in New England.The deacons of many a church have drunk the communion wine with me; the selectmen of divers towns make me their chairman; and a majority of the Great and General Court are firm supporters of my interest.The governor and I, too—But these are state secrets.”"
"“真有此事？”古德曼·布朗叫道，震惊地盯住他泰然自若的同伴。“不管怎样，我同州长还有议会都毫无瓜葛。随他们做什么，也管不着像我这样的普通百姓。但若我继续跟随你去，以后在萨勒姆村里叫我怎么再面对那个仁慈的老人，我们教长的目光呢？哦，他的声音在无论安息日还是布道日都使我颤抖。”","“Can this be so?” cried Goodman Brown, with a stare of amazement at his undisturbed companion.“Howbeit, I have nothing to do with the governor and council; they have their own ways, and are no rule for a simple husbandman like me.But, were I to go on with thee, how should I meet the eye of that good old man, our minister, at Salem village?Oh, his voice would make me tremble both Sabbath day and lecture day.”"
"年长的行者直到刚才都还保持着适当的严肃聆听着，但此时却忽然迸出一阵抑制不住的大笑；他的身体摇晃得那样厉害，连他的蛇形手杖看起来也似受了感染而一起摆动着。","Thus far the elder traveller had listened with due gravity; but now burst into a fit of irrepressible mirth, shaking himself so violently that his snake-like staff actually seemed to wriggle in sympathy."
"“哈！哈！哈！”他笑个不停，然后，他控制住自己，“好吧，继续，古德曼·布朗，继续说。不过，我请求你，再逗我笑就会要命了。”","“Ha! ha! ha!” shouted he again and again; then composing himself, “Well, go on, Goodman Brown, go on; but, prithee, don’t kill me with laughing.”"
"“那好啊，现在就结束这个话题吧。”古德曼·布朗被深深激怒了，说道，“我有妻子，费丝。这会让她可怜的心碎了的；我宁愿让我自己心碎。”","“Well, then, to end the matter at once,” said Goodman Brown, considerably nettled, “there is my wife, Faith.It would break her dear little heart; and I’d rather break my own.”"
"“可别，如果是因为这个，”老者答道，“那就走你自己的路吧，古德曼·布朗。给我二十个前面那样摇摇晃晃的老太婆我也不愿费丝受任何伤害。”","“Nay, if that be the case,” answered the other, “e’en go thy ways, Goodman Brown.I would not for twenty old women like the one hobbling before us that Faith should come to any harm.”"
"一边说着，他将手杖指向了小路上一个女人的身影，古德曼·布朗认出那是一个极虔诚的、模范般的老妇人，她曾给年幼的布朗讲解教义问答。而今，她与教长，还有古金执事都仍然是他道德与精神上的导师。","As he spoke he pointed his staff at a female figure on the path, in whom Goodman Brown recognized a very pious and exemplary dame, who had taught him his catechism in youth, and was still his moral and spiritual adviser, jointly with the minister and Deacon Gookin."
"“简直不可思议，古迪·克劳伊斯会在黄昏时分走到这样深的荒林里来。”布朗说道，“但若你允许，朋友，我想从林中抄个近路，等我们把这个女基督徒甩在身后再会合。她不认识你，也许会问起我是同谁在一起，要到何处去。”","“A marvel, truly, that Goody Cloyse should be so far in the wilderness at nightfall,” said he.“But with your leave, friend, I shall take a cut through the woods until we have left this Christian woman behind.Being a stranger to you, she might ask whom I was consorting with and whither I was going.”"
"“就这么办。”他的同行者说，“步入丛林吧，我将循路前行。”","“Be it so,” said his fellow-traveller.“Betake you to the woods, and let me keep the path.”"
"年轻人依言转到一旁，却留心看着他的同伴，后者正轻快地沿着小路向前走去，直到距老妇一仗之遥处方驻足。而此时，她正一边嘴中念念有词——毫无疑问，是祷词——一边快速行走着，这速度对于上了年纪的女人来说可谓是神奇的。行者伸出他的手杖，以状似蛇尾的部分碰了碰她干瘪的颈部。","Accordingly the young man turned aside, but took care to watch his companion, who advanced softly along the road until he had come within a staff’s length of the old dame.She, meanwhile, was making the best of her way, with singular speed for so aged a woman, and mumbling some indistinct words—a prayer, doubtless—as she went.The traveller put forth his staff and touched her withered neck with what seemed the serpent’s tail."
"“魔鬼！”虔诚的老妇人惊叫起来。","“The devil!” screamed the pious old lady."
"“看来古迪·克劳伊斯还认得她的老朋友？”行者说道，拄着他扭曲的拐杖走到她面前。","“Then Goody Cloyse knows her old friend?” observed the traveller, confronting her and leaning on his writhing stick."
"“啊，不错，当真是阁下本人吗？”那仁慈的老妇叫道，“是了，当真是您，模样就像我那个专爱搬弄是非的老伙计，如今那个傻孩子古德曼·布朗的祖父。但是——阁下您信吗？——我的扫帚离奇失踪了，依我所料，是叫人偷了，被那个没能被绞死的巫婆，古迪·考里。可她也消失不见了，那时我浑身正涂满毒芹、委陵菜和狼毒乌头的汁液。”","“Ah, forsooth, and is it your worship indeed?” cried the good dame.“Yea, truly is it, and in the very image of my old gossip, Goodman Brown, the grandfather of the silly fellow that now is.But—would your worship believe it?—my broomstick hath strangely disappeared, stolen, as I suspect, by that unhanged witch, Goody Cory, and that, too, when I was all anointed with the juice of smallage, and cinquefoil, and wolf’s bane.”"
"“再掺进精磨面粉和新生儿的脂肪。”那个貌似老古德曼·布朗的人说道。","“Mingled with fine wheat and the fat of a new-born babe.” said the shape of old Goodman Brown."
"“哈，阁下您知道这个配方。”老妇人说着，咯咯大笑起来，“喏，就像我说的，我准备好要去赴会，可没有马骑，我就下决心走着去。因为我听人说今晚会有一个挺不错的小伙子被带去参加集会。现在请阁下许我挽住您的手臂吧，这样我们一眨眼的功夫就能到了。”","“Ah, your worship knows the recipe,” cried the old lady, cackling aloud.“So, as I was saying, being all ready for the meeting, and no horse to ride on, I made up my mind to foot it; for they tell me there is a nice young man to be taken into communion to-night.But now your good worship will lend me your arm, and we shall be there in a twinkling.”"
"“恐怕不行。”她的朋友答道，“我没法腾出手臂给你，古迪·克劳伊斯，不过如果你愿意，就拿上我的手杖吧。”","“That can hardly be,” answered her friend.“I may not spare you my arm, Goody Cloyse; but here is my staff, if you will.”"
"说着，他把手杖扔到她脚下。手杖在那里就像活过来了一般，这便是当年被他的主人借给埃及巫师的那根。不过这件事，古德曼·布朗便无论如何也不能得知了。他吃惊地抬起头来，随后又朝地下看了看，古迪·克劳伊斯同那根蛇形手杖都不见了，只有他的同行者正从容地等着他，仿佛什么也未曾发生过一般。","So saying, he threw it down at her feet, where, perhaps, it assumed life, being one of the rods which its owner had formerly lent to the Egyptian magi.Of this fact, however, Goodman Brown could not take cognizance.He had cast up his eyes in astonishment, and, looking down again, beheld neither Goody Cloyse nor the serpentine staff, but his fellow-traveller alone, who waited for him as calmly as if nothing had happened."
"“是那个老妇人交给我教义问答的。”年轻人道，而这简单的一句话里深意无限。","“That old woman taught me my catechism,” said the young man; and there was a world of meaning in this simple comment."
"他们继续前行，年长的行者一边劝说着他的同伴加快速度，并且沿着道路前进；他的言语如此亲切，仿佛他所有的论调都非出自他口，而是从听者心中自然生出。走着走着，他折下一根枫树枝以作拐杖之用，并将那为夜露润湿的细嫩枝丫劈去。在触到他手指的一瞬间，它们莫名地枯萎了，仿佛为一整周的日照晒干了一般。他们便以一种轻松自如的速度这样走着。直到来到路上一处幽暗的凹地，古德曼·布朗突然坐到一个树桩上，拒绝向前再走一步。","They continued to walk onward, while the elder traveller exhorted his companion to make good speed and persevere in the path, discoursing so aptly that his arguments seemed rather to spring up in the bosom of his auditor than to be suggested by himself.As they went, he plucked a branch of maple to serve for a walking stick, and began to strip it of the twigs and little boughs, which were wet with evening dew.The moment his fingers touched them they became strangely withered and dried up as with a week’s sunshine.Thus the pair proceeded, at a good free pace, until suddenly, in a gloomy hollow of the road, Goodman Brown sat himself down on the stump of a tree and refused to go any farther."
"“朋友，”他坚决地说，“我心意已决。不会再为此事多走一步。如果这该死的老太婆真的在我以为她将走向天堂时选择步入地狱，我又有何理由舍弃我亲爱的费丝而去追随她的脚步呢？”","“Friend,” said he, stubbornly, “my mind is made up.Not another step will I budge on this errand.What if a wretched old woman do choose to go to the devil when I thought she was going to heaven: is that any reason why I should quit my dear Faith and go after her?”"
"“你会渐渐想明白的。”他的同伴不动声色地说，“坐这里歇会儿吧，等你觉得想要再次启程，我的手杖会从旁相助的。”","“You will think better of this by and by,” said his acquaintance, composedly.“Sit here and rest yourself a while; and when you feel like moving again, there is my staff to help you along.”"
"他不再多说，将那根枫树手杖掷给同伴，然后就像消失在越来越浓重的黑暗中一般，很快就不见了。年轻人在路边坐了一会儿，为自己感到欢欣鼓舞，想着以后若在清晨时分遇上散步的教长自己能够多么问心无愧，且在仁慈的老古金执事的目光下也无需畏缩退避。而他本打算付诸邪恶的这个夜晚，如今重又变得纯净而甜美，他将在费丝的怀抱里获得怎样安宁的睡眠！沉浸在这令人愉悦又值得赞赏的遐想中，古德曼·布朗听到沿着道路迤逦而来的阵阵马蹄声。尽管如今他已乐而知返，但意识到究竟是被邪念带来这里的，他觉得进林里藏身应是明智之举。","Without more words, he threw his companion the maple stick, and was as speedily out of sight as if he had vanished into the deepening gloom.The young man sat a few moments by the roadside, applauding himself greatly, and thinking with how clear a conscience he should meet the minister in his morning walk, nor shrink from the eye of good old Deacon Gookin.And what calm sleep would be his that very night, which was to have been spent so wickedly, but so purely and sweetly now, in the arms of Faith!Amidst these pleasant and praiseworthy meditations, Goodman Brown heard the tramp of horses along the road, and deemed it advisable to conceal himself within the verge of the forest, conscious of the guilty purpose that had brought him thither, though now so happily turned from it."
"骑手的话音随着蹄声渐行渐近，两个苍老低沉的声音在严肃地交谈着。听起来那混杂的声音正经过距年轻人藏身之处不过几码远的道路，然而，无疑是由于那一处过于幽暗，无论骑行者还是他们的坐骑都无法看清。一线明净的天空横过他们的必经之路，然而尽管他们擦过道旁的枝丫，仍见不到他们的身影遮住过天空所投下的淡淡幽光，哪怕只是片刻。古德曼·布朗时而蜷身下蹲，时而踮脚站立，尽量拨开树枝，探头出去，可他一个人影也未见到。他听得出那声音是教长和古金执事的，这使他越发烦恼起来，因为他可以起誓真有此事。他们二人一如平日里前往某个授圣职礼或是教区会议时一般，让马儿安静地一路小跑。但这时仍能听到，其中的一位骑手勒住马，折了一根树枝。","On came the hoof tramps and the voices of the riders, two grave old voices, conversing soberly as they drew near.These mingled sounds appeared to pass along the road, within a few yards of the young man’s hiding-place; but, owing doubtless to the depth of the gloom at that particular spot, neither the travellers nor their steeds were visible.Though their figures brushed the small boughs by the wayside, it could not be seen that they intercepted, even for a moment, the faint gleam from the strip of bright sky athwart which they must have passed.Goodman Brown alternately crouched and stood on tiptoe, pulling aside the branches and thrusting forth his head as far as he durst without discerning so much as a shadow.It vexed him the more, because he could have sworn, were such a thing possible, that he recognized the voices of the minister and Deacon Gookin, jogging along quietly, as they were wont to do, when bound to some ordination or ecclesiastical council.While yet within hearing, one of the riders stopped to pluck a switch."
"“教长先生，这二者之中，”听起来像是执事的那个声音说道，“我宁愿错过一次授圣职礼的晚宴，也不愿错过今夜的聚会。听说咱们教团中有些人来自法尔茅斯，甚至更远的地方，而另一些来自康涅狄格和罗得岛，此外还有一些印第安巫师，他们以自己的方式施法，却几乎跟我们之中最优秀的人不相上下。不仅如此，有一位年轻貌美的女士就要被吸纳入会了。”","“Of the two, reverend sir,” said the voice like the deacon’s, “I had rather miss an ordination dinner than to-night’s meeting.They tell me that some of our community are to be here from Falmouth and beyond, and others from Connecticut and Rhode Island, besides several of the Indian powwows, who, after their fashion, know almost as much deviltry as the best of us.Moreover, there is a goodly young woman to be taken into communion.”"
"“太棒了，古金执事！”牧师那苍老而庄严的嗓音回答道，“扬鞭吧，不然我们就要迟了。你知道，除非到达场地，不然我们什么也做不了。”","“Mighty well, Deacon Gookin!” replied the solemn old tones of the minister.“Spur up, or we shall be late.Nothing can be done, you know, until I get on the ground.”"
"蹄声再次哒哒作响，而那在寂寥的空气中显得如此诡异的话音穿林而过，林中是从未有教民聚集，也无虔诚教徒祈祷过的地方。那么，这两位深入异教荒野的神职人员能够去向何方呢？年轻的古德曼·布朗紧紧抱住一棵树支撑着自己；他几乎要跪倒在地，昏厥过去了，内心强烈的不适让他不堪重负。仰望天空，他怀疑那之上是否真的有一座天堂。然而在那碧蓝的苍穹之间，群星正熠熠闪耀。","The hoofs clattered again; and the voices, talking so strangely in the empty air, passed on through the forest, where no church had ever been gathered or solitary Christian prayed.Whither, then, could these holy men be journeying so deep into the heathen wilderness?Young Goodman Brown caught hold of a tree for support, being ready to sink down on the ground, faint and overburdened with the heavy sickness of his heart.He looked up to the sky, doubting whether there really was a heaven above him.Yet there was the blue arch, and the stars brightening in it."
"“皇天在上，费丝在下，我将誓不与魔鬼为伍！”古德曼·布朗大声喊道。","“With heaven above and Faith below, I will yet stand firm against the devil!” cried Goodman Brown."
"当他抬头凝视着苍穹深处，举起双手起誓的时候，尽管没有一丝风吹过，可一片乌云飞快地移过穹顶，将闪烁的星星遮蔽了起来。在他头顶上，这朵乌云正急速向北飘去，而其他处仍可见碧蓝的夜空。高空之上，仿佛自那云团的深处传来一阵含混而可疑的话音。听者一度以为他能够分辨出他镇上居民的口音，男人的和女人的，虔诚的与不虔诚的，其中许多人他都在圣餐桌前碰到过，还有一些人他在酒馆中见过他们纵情作乐。而转瞬间，那声音又变得如此模糊，他怀疑也许除却这古老森林的喃喃低语，他什么也没有听见，尽管并无一丝风吹过。而后，那些熟悉的声音增强了，尽管每天在萨勒姆村的阳光下都能听到，在这乌云蔽天的夜晚却是闻所未闻。一个年轻女子的声音正诉着悲苦的音调，带着犹疑的哀伤，乞求着帮助，而或许得到那帮助将更令她痛苦。可所有那些他看不到的人们，圣徒与罪人，都似乎在怂恿她向前。","While he still gazed upward into the deep arch of the firmament and had lifted his hands to pray, a cloud, though no wind was stirring, hurried across the zenith and hid the brightening stars.The blue sky was still visible, except directly overhead, where this black mass of cloud was sweeping swiftly northward.Aloft in the air, as if from the depths of the cloud, came a confused and doubtful sound of voices.Once the listener fancied that he could distinguish the accents of towns-people of his own, men and women, both pious and ungodly, many of whom he had met at the communion table, and had seen others rioting at the tavern.The next moment, so indistinct were the sounds, he doubted whether he had heard aught but the murmur of the old forest, whispering without a wind.Then came a stronger swell of those familiar tones, heard daily in the sunshine at Salem village, but never until now from a cloud of night There was one voice of a young woman, uttering lamentations, yet with an uncertain sorrow, and entreating for some favor, which, perhaps, it would grieve her to obtain; and all the unseen multitude, both saints and sinners, seemed to encourage her onward."
"“费丝！”古德曼·布朗大叫道，声音里充满悲愤与绝望。而林中的回声也学着他大叫着“费丝！费丝！”仿佛有许多狂乱的不幸之人在这荒林之中四处找寻着她。","“Faith!” shouted Goodman Brown, in a voice of agony and desperation; and the echoes of the forest mocked him, crying, “Faith! Faith!” as if bewildered wretches were seeking her all through the wilderness."
"这伤心的丈夫屏息等待着回应，而那悲痛、狂躁又恐怖的喊声仍一阵阵穿刺着夜色。一声尖叫响起，瞬间便淹没在噪杂的喧闹声中，渐渐化作一阵远去的笑音。此时乌云散去，重新露出古德曼·布朗头顶上方那澄澈宁静的天空。但有个东西轻轻从空中飘落，挂在了一根树枝上。年轻人将它抓住，只见是一条粉色的缎带。","The cry of grief, rage, and terror was yet piercing the night, when the unhappy husband held his breath for a response.There was a scream, drowned immediately in a louder murmur of voices, fading into far-off laughter, as the dark cloud swept away, leaving the clear and silent sky above Goodman Brown.But something fluttered lightly down through the air and caught on the branch of a tree.The young man seized it, and beheld a pink ribbon."
"“我的费丝走了！”怔了一会儿，他喊道，“这世间没有善，罪恶也不过是个名号。来吧，魔鬼，既然这世界已交付与你。”","“My Faith is gone!” cried he, after one stupefied moment.“There is no good on earth; and sin is but a name.Come, devil; for to thee is this world given.”"
"由于绝望得几近疯狂，他朗声大笑了许久。而后，古德曼·布朗抓过他的手杖再次启程，他走得那样快，看起来仿佛是在沿着树林飞驰，而非行走或是奔跑。道路越来越荒凉可怖，也越来越难以辨别，最终消失不见了，带着引诱凡人走向邪恶的本能，依然向着前方急速延伸，把他抛在这漆黑的荒林中心。整个树林里充满了恐怖的声音——树木吱嘎作响，野兽在嚎叫，印第安人尖声吵嚷。风声铮铮，时而如同远方教堂的钟声鸣响，时而又在行人身畔发出洪亮的咆哮，仿佛整个自然界都在鄙夷和嘲弄他。但他本人却是这可怖场景的主角，全然不为其他恐怖的事物所骇。","And, maddened with despair, so that he laughed loud and long, did Goodman Brown grasp his staff and set forth again, at such a rate that he seemed to fly along the forest path rather than to walk or run.The road grew wilder and drearier and more faintly traced, and vanished at length, leaving him in the heart of the dark wilderness, still rushing onward with the instinct that guides mortal man to evil.The whole forest was peopled with frightful sounds—the creaking of the trees, the howling of wild beasts, and the yell of Indians; while sometimes the wind tolled like a distant church bell, and sometimes gave a broad roar around the traveller, as if all Nature were laughing him to scorn.But he was himself the chief horror of the scene, and shrank not from its other horrors."
"“哈！哈！哈！”当风嘲笑他的时候，古德曼·布朗吼着。","“Ha! ha! ha!” roared Goodman Brown when the wind laughed at him."
"“让我们听听谁笑得最响。别想凭你的妖术吓到我。来吧巫婆，来吧巫士，来吧印第安祭司，来吧你魔鬼，古德曼·布朗在此。你有多吓人，他就有多吓人。”","“Let us hear which will laugh loudest.Think not to frighten me with your deviltry.Come witch, come wizard, come Indian powwow, come devil himself, and here comes Goodman Brown.You may as well fear him as he fear you.”"
"的确如此，在弥散着恐怖气息的树林之中，再没有什么比古德曼·布朗的身影更可怕的了。他一边在幽暗的松林间疾速穿行，一边丧心病狂地挥动着手杖，恣意地叫嚣着那些可怕的渎神字眼，如今又放声大笑，使林间回声震荡，仿佛有一群魔鬼围在他身边一般。即便魔鬼本人也比不上一个胸中溢满愤怒的凡人来得可怕。他着了魔似的加速狂奔，直到他在林木之间打着冷战，望见前面有一点红光，似乎是那些伐倒的树干与折断的树枝被点燃了，熊熊火光在夜半时分冲天而起。方才驱赶他前行的那阵狂躁平息了，他停住脚步，听到远方传来众人颂着赞美诗的庄严声音。他熟悉这个旋律；这正是村礼拜堂的唱诗班常唱的曲目。歌声戛然而止，而另一种非人声的嗡鸣仍在继续；在一片荒蛮的树林中，各种音响无比和谐地齐奏着。古德曼·布朗叫出声来，可那声音同这荒野的呼声杂糅、消泯，最后连他自己都听不到了。","In truth, all through the haunted forest there could be nothing more frightful than the figure of Goodman Brown.On he flew among the black pines, brandishing his staff with frenzied gestures, now giving vent to an inspiration of horrid blasphemy, and now shouting forth such laughter as set all the echoes of the forest laughing like demons around him.The fiend in his own shape is less hideous than when he rages in the breast of man.Thus sped the demoniac on his course, until, quivering among the trees, he saw a red light before him, as when the felled trunks and branches of a clearing have been set on fire, and throw up their lurid blaze against the sky, at the hour of midnight.He paused, in a lull of the tempest that had driven him onward, and heard the swell of what seemed a hymn, rolling solemnly from a distance with the weight of many voices.He knew the tune; it was a familiar one in the choir of the village meeting-house.The verse died heavily away, and was lengthened by a chorus, not of human voices, but of all the sounds of the benighted wilderness pealing in awful harmony together.Goodman Brown cried out, and his cry was lost to his own ear by its unison with the cry of the desert."
"趁着声音间歇，他蹑足走上前去，直到火光完全映照在他面前。在空地的另一端，幽暗的林壁环绕着一块岩石，它同祭坛或讲坛有些原始而天然的相似之处，周围四棵只燃着了树冠的松树，仿佛晚祷时的蜡烛一般。大片生长至石块上方的树叶都烧着了，火焰高耸入夜，恰好照亮整片场地。每一根垂下的细枝与花彩般的叶片都燃烧着。随着红光的起落，无数教众现出身影，又消失在阴影之中，而后又再次出现，仿佛他们是在暗夜之中忽然聚集到这寂寥的丛林中似的。","In the interval of silence he stole forward until the light glared full upon his eyes.At one extremity of an open space, hemmed in by the dark wall of the forest, arose a rock, bearing some rude, natural resemblance either to an altar or a pulpit, and surrounded by four blazing pines, their tops aflame, their stems untouched, like candles at an evening meeting.The mass of foliage that had overgrown the summit of the rock was all on fire, blazing high into the night and fitfully illuminating the whole field.Each pendent twig and leafy festoon was in a blaze.As the red light arose and fell, a numerous congregation alternately shone forth, then disappeared in shadow, and again grew, as it were, out of the darkness, peopling the heart of the solitary woods at once."
"“好个阴森森的黑暗集团。”古德曼·布朗自语道。","“A grave and dark-clad company,” quoth Goodman Brown."
"事实也确实如此。在这些明暗中时隐时现的面孔中，有一些翌日便会出现在地方议事会上，而另一些则在一个又一个安息日里，从世间最最神圣的讲坛上虔诚地仰望上苍，又宽容地俯视着座下众生。有些人坚称州长夫人也出现了。至少，那里有她所熟识的贵妇名媛、丈夫们忠贞的妻子、人数众多的寡妇、声誉绝佳的老处女，以及年轻貌美的姑娘们——正因为担心被母亲察觉而禁不住浑身发抖。不知是因为晦暗的场地上忽地闪过一道火光，还是因为认出了多位萨勒姆村上久沐圣名的教友，古德曼·布朗感到一阵惶惑。仁慈的老古金执事也到了，正侍奉在那位庄严的圣者，他所崇敬的教长身旁。然而，与这些庄重的、可敬的、虔诚的人们，这些教堂中的长老、贞德的贵妇，以及纯洁的少女们极不合衬的是，那些生活放荡的男人和名节有瑕的女人，以及那些早就与一切肮脏卑鄙为伍的可耻之徒，甚至被指控犯下可怕罪行的恶人也俱在此地。奇怪的是，好人并未在恶人面前退避，罪人也未受到圣人的羞辱。那些印第安祭司，或者说巫师们，也散布在他们白皮肤的对头之中。他们时常对自己聚居的森林施一些比之英格兰妖术更可怖的、闻所未闻的咒语。","In truth they were such.Among them, quivering to and fro between gloom and splendor, appeared faces that would be seen next day at the council board of the province, and others which, Sabbath after Sabbath, looked devoutly heavenward, and benignantly over the crowded pews, from the holiest pulpits in the land.Some affirm that the lady of the governor was there.At least there were high dames well known to her, and wives of honored husbands, and widows, a great multitude, and ancient maidens, all of excellent repute, and fair young girls, who trembled lest their mothers should espy them.Either the sudden gleams of light flashing over the obscure field bedazzled Goodman Brown, or he recognized a score of the church members of Salem village famous for their especial sanctity.Good old Deacon Gookin had arrived, and waited at the skirts of that venerable saint, his revered pastor.But, irreverently consorting with these grave, reputable, and pious people, these elders of the church, these chaste dames and dewy virgins, there were men of dissolute lives and women of spotted fame, wretches given over to all mean and filthy vice, and suspected even of horrid crimes.It was strange to see that the good shrank not from the wicked, nor were the sinners abashed by the saints.Scattered also among their pale-faced enemies were the Indian priests, or powwows, who had often scared their native forest with more hideous incantations than any known to English witchcraft."
"“可是，费丝在哪里呢？”古德曼·布朗心想，希望涌上心头，他不禁战栗起来。","“But where is Faith?” thought Goodman Brown; and, as hope came into his heart, he trembled."
"又一首赞美诗唱响，曲调轻缓凄怆，正如虔敬之爱，然而与之相伴的歌词描述的却是世人所能想象的一切罪恶，而晦涩地暗示于其中的则更多。但凭凡智是绝难揣测恶魔之思的。歌词一段接一段地唱响，荒林间的合鸣掺杂其间，如同一架巨大风琴的低音。直到那可怖圣歌的最后，响起了一个声音，如风啸，如溪湍，如兽嗥，而这荒蛮林野间的其他一切声响也交织进来，附和着这罪人之声向万恶之王顶礼膜拜。四棵燃烧的松树掀起一朵更高的火焰，在这叛教的会众上方形成一圈圈烟幕，其间现出模糊的形状与狰狞的面孔。岩石上的火焰此刻也发出冉冉红光，在其之上形成一道不断升高的拱门，一个身影出现在那里。可以毫无不恭地说，这个人影无论衣着举止，都与某些新英格兰教堂的庄严牧师毫不相像。","Another verse of the hymn arose, a slow and mournful strain, such as the pious love, but joined to words which expressed all that our nature can conceive of sin, and darkly hinted at far more.Unfathomable to mere mortals is the lore of fiends.Verse after verse was sung; and still the chorus of the desert swelled between like the deepest tone of a mighty organ; and with the final peal of that dreadful anthem there came a sound, as if the roaring wind, the rushing streams, the howling beasts, and every other voice of the unconcerted wilderness were mingling and according with the voice of guilty man in homage to the prince of all.The four blazing pines threw up a loftier flame, and obscurely discovered shapes and visages of horror on the smoke wreaths above the impious assembly.At the same moment the fire on the rock shot redly forth and formed a glowing arch above its base, where now appeared a figure.With reverence be it spoken, the figure bore no slight similitude, both in garb and manner, to some grave divine of the New England churches."
"“将皈依者带上前来！”一个声音大声说道，回声穿过场地，在林中回荡。","“Bring forth the converts!” cried a voice that echoed through the field and rolled into the forest."
"话音未落，古德曼·布朗便从树影中走出，走近聚集的人群。出于对自己心中所有邪念的怜悯，他感到自己对他们产生了一种令他生厌的手足之情。他几乎可以发誓是他已故父亲的形象在招手让他上前，从一团烟幕中俯视着他；而一个女人在朦胧中显出绝望的表情，伸出手告诫他后退。那难道是他的母亲？然而当教长和仁慈的老古金执事抓住他的手臂将他带去那燃烧着的岩石时，他无力后退一步，也无力反抗，甚至连动一下这个念头的力量都没有。在那里，一个身材苗条、头戴面纱的女子也出现了。从旁带领着她的分别是教义问答的虔诚讲师古迪·克劳伊斯，以及已得到魔鬼的允诺成为地狱女皇的玛莎·卡瑞尔。一个张狂的老巫婆。叛教者便立在那火焰的华盖之下。","At the word, Goodman Brown stepped forth from the shadow of the trees and approached the congregation, with whom he felt a loathful brotherhood by the sympathy of all that was wicked in his heart.He could have well-nigh sworn that the shape of his own dead father beckoned him to advance, looking downward from a smoke wreath, while a woman, with dim features of despair, threw out her hand to warn him back.Was it his mother?But he had no power to retreat one step, nor to resist, even in thought, when the minister and good old Deacon Gookin seized his arms and led him to the blazing rock.Thither came also the slender form of a veiled female, led between Goody Cloyse, that pious teacher of the catechism, and Martha Carrier, who had received the devil’s promise to be queen of hell.A rampant hag was she.And there stood the proselytes beneath the canopy of fire."
"“欢迎，我的孩子们，”那个黑影说道，“欢迎加入属于你们族群的教团。你们如此年轻，就已找到自己的本性和命运。我的孩子们，看看你们身后！”","“Welcome, my children,” said the dark figure, “to the communion of your race.Ye have found thus young your nature and your destiny.My children, look behind you!”"
"他们转过身去，只见一片火光之中，魔鬼的追随者们蜂拥而前，每一张面孔上都闪露出模糊的微笑表示欢迎。","They turned; and flashing forth, as it were, in a sheet of flame, the fiend worshippers were seen; the smile of welcome gleamed darkly on every visage."
"“那些，”那团黑影继续说，“都是你们自幼尊敬的人。你们以为他们比你们高尚，与他们正直忠贞的人生和向天国祝祷的虔诚相比，你们为自己的罪恶感到惭愧。而今他们却都来到了我的集会。今夜你们应当了解他们的秘密了：须发花白的教会长老如何悄悄对家中的年轻女佣说出淫辞荡语；多少女人为了穿上寡妇的丧服而令丈夫在她怀中饮鸩而眠，永无觉日；须髯未生的少年如何为了继承父亲的遗产而迫其早亡；还有，那些美貌的少女——别脸红，可人儿们——如何在花园中掘出小小坟茔，邀我做那夭折婴孩葬礼上唯一的来宾。罪恶在你们的凡心中所引起的共鸣应当使你们察觉到所有这些地点——无论教堂、卧房、街道、田野，还是林间——罪行在这些地方犯下，而你们应为见到整个世间都是一座血迹斑斑的罪恶泥潭而欢欣鼓舞。不仅如此。你们将洞悉每一个人的内心，那罪孽的最神秘所在，一切邪恶伎俩的源泉，在那里不竭的恶念源源而出，强于一切人类的力量——更甚于我的伟力——所能够付诸行动的。现在，我的孩子们，好好看看你们彼此吧。”","“There,” resumed the sable form, “are all whom ye have reverenced from youth.Ye deemed them holier than yourselves, and shrank from your own sin, contrasting it with their lives of righteousness and prayerful aspirations heavenward.Yet here are they all in my worshipping assembly.This night it shall be granted you to know their secret deeds: how hoary-bearded elders of the church have whispered wanton words to the young maids of their households; how many a woman, eager for widows’ weeds, has given her husband a drink at bedtime and let him sleep his last sleep in her bosom; how beardless youths have made haste to inherit their fathers’ wealth; and how fair damsels—blush not, sweet ones—have dug little graves in the garden, and bidden me, the sole guest to an infant’s funeral.By the sympathy of your human hearts for sin ye shall scent out all the places—whether in church, bedchamber, street, field, or forest—where crime has been committed, and shall exult to behold the whole earth one stain of guilt, one mighty blood spot.Far more than this.It shall be yours to penetrate, in every bosom, the deep mystery of sin, the fountain of all wicked arts, and which inexhaustibly supplies more evil impulses than human power—than my power at its utmost—can make manifest in deeds.And now, my children, look upon each other.”"
"他们照做了，在燃自地狱的火光中，这可怜人望着他的费丝，后者也回望着她的丈夫，皆在毫不神圣的祭坛之前瑟瑟发抖。","They did so; and, by the blaze of the hell-kindled torches, the wretched man beheld his Faith, and the wife her husband, trembling before that unhallowed altar."
"“瞧，我的孩子们，你们就这样站在那儿。”那人影以一种低沉而庄严的语调说道，由于巨大的绝望而显得近乎伤感，仿佛他曾经纯善的天性仍在哀悼我们这可悲的族群。“你们信赖彼此的内心，仍希望美德并非尽如梦境一场。如今你们该当明了。恶乃人之本性。不从恶难以为乐。我的孩子们，再次欢迎你们加入你们族类自己的团体。”","“Lo, there ye stand, my children,” said the figure, in a deep and solemn tone, almost sad with its despairing awfulness, as if his once angelic nature could yet mourn for our miserable race.“Depending upon one another’s hearts, ye had still hoped that virtue were not all a dream.Now are ye undeceived.Evil is the nature of mankind.Evil must be your only happiness.Welcome again, my children, to the communion of your race.”"
"“欢迎，”恶魔的信徒们大声呼喊着，声音中带着得胜般的绝望。","“Welcome,” repeated the fiend worshippers, in one cry of despair and triumph."
"而他们就站在那里，看起来像是这黑暗世界中唯一一对仍在邪恶边缘游移不定的人。岩石之上有一处天然的凹陷。盛在里面的是被熊熊焰火映红的水，还是血，抑或是一团流动的火焰？魔鬼在此蘸湿他的手指，准备在他们前额留下洗礼的印记。他们或许从此得以分享罪恶之奥秘，无论来自行动还是思想，他们都能通晓他人的隐秘罪恶，甚至比他们自己的罪恶还更为清楚。做丈夫的向他面色苍白的妻子投去一瞥，而费丝也同样瞧了他一眼。二人都为他们所泄露的和眼见的情形战栗着。倘再多看一眼，他们将在彼此眼中成为何种堕落之人啊！","And there they stood, the only pair, as it seemed, who were yet hesitating on the verge of wickedness in this dark world.A basin was hollowed, naturally, in the rock.Did it contain water, reddened by the lurid light? or was it blood? or, perchance, a liquid flame?Herein did the shape of evil dip his hand and prepare to lay the mark of baptism upon their foreheads, that they might be partakers of the mystery of sin, more conscious of the secret guilt of others, both in deed and thought, than they could now be of their own.The husband cast one look at his pale wife, and Faith at him.What polluted wretches would the next glance show them to each other, shuddering alike at what they disclosed and what they saw!"
"“费丝！费丝！”丈夫大喊道，“抬头看看天堂，拒绝这份邪恶吧。”","“Faith! Faith!” cried the husband, “look up to heaven, and resist the wicked one.”"
"然而费丝是否听从了他的话，他不得而知。话未说完，他发觉自己已孤零零地身处于平静的夜色之中，听着风声穿过树林沉寂下去。他踉踉跄跄地倚住那块岩石，感到它冰冷而潮湿，一条方才完全燃烧着的幼枝将一滴极寒的露水滴在了他的脸上。","Whether Faith obeyed he knew not.Hardly had he spoken when he found himself amid calm night and solitude, listening to a roar of the wind which died heavily away through the forest.He staggered against the rock, and felt it chill and damp; while a hanging twig, that had been all on fire, besprinkled his cheek with the coldest dew."
"翌日清晨，年轻的古德曼·布朗缓缓步入萨勒姆村的街道，如迷途之人一般茫然四顾。仁慈的老教长正在墓地中散步，以便增进早餐的食欲，同时思考布道的内容。他在经过古德曼·布朗时给他赐福。布朗却如畏避诅咒一般在这位可敬的圣人面前退缩了。老古金执事正在家中祷告，透过敞开的窗子能够听到他神圣的祷词。“这巫士却在向何方神圣祈祷？”古德曼·布朗自语道。古迪·克劳伊斯，那位无与伦比的老基督徒，正沐着清晨的日光站在自家的院子里，向给她送来一品脱牛奶的小女孩讲答教义。古德曼·布朗将孩子一把拉开，仿佛让他脱离的是魔鬼的掌心。转过礼拜堂前的拐角，他看到了费丝，头戴那条粉色缎带，焦虑地凝望着前方，一见到他就沿着街道雀跃而出，几乎要当着全镇亲吻她的丈夫。然而古德曼·布朗痛苦而严肃地望着她的脸，没打一声招呼就走过去了。","The next morning young Goodman Brown came slowly into the street of Salem village, staring around him like a bewildered man.The good old minister was taking a walk along the graveyard to get an appetite for breakfast and meditate his sermon, and bestowed a blessing, as he passed, on Goodman Brown.He shrank from the venerable saint as if to avoid an anathema.Old Deacon Gookin was at domestic worship, and the holy words of his prayer were heard through the open window.“What God doth the wizard pray to?” quoth Goodman Brown.Goody Cloyse, that excellent old Christian, stood in the early sunshine at her own lattice, catechizing a little girl who had brought her a pint of morning’s milk.Goodman Brown snatched away the child as from the grasp of the fiend himself.Turning the corner by the meeting-house, he spied the head of Faith, with the pink ribbons, gazing anxiously forth, and bursting into such joy at sight of him that she skipped along the street and almost kissed her husband before the whole village.But Goodman Brown looked sternly and sadly into her face, and passed on without a greeting."
"难道古德曼·布朗只是在林中睡了一觉，做了一场巫师聚会的荒唐梦？","Had Goodman Brown fallen asleep in the forest and only dreamed a wild dream of a witch-meeting?"
"倘你愿做此想，悉听尊便。可是，唉！对于年轻的古德曼·布朗，那就是一场邪兆之梦。自那个充斥可怕梦境的夜晚之后，即便算不上心灰意冷，他也变成了一个多愁寡言、思虑过重又疑神疑鬼的人。每当教众在安息日唱起神圣的诗篇，他都无法聆听下去，因为一首罪恶的颂歌正剧烈地冲击着他的耳膜，淹没所有祈福的乐音。每当牧师把手放在翻开的《圣经》之上，站在讲坛上慷慨陈词，宣讲教义中那些神圣的真理，圣徒般的生活与圆满之死，来生的欢乐或难以言说的苦痛，古德曼·布朗都会变得面色惨白，担心房顶会轰然坍塌，倒在这须发花白的渎神者与他的听众身上。每每当他在夜半时分惊醒，他便会从费丝怀中抽身出来；而当全家人在清晨或黄昏时分跪下祈祷，他便皱起眉嘀咕着，冷冷地盯住他的妻子，然后转身走开。而后，当他已活得够久，终于成为一具苍老的尸首被抬往墓地时，已是垂垂老妇的费丝，连同他的子孙，以及为数不少的邻里街坊组成了一列浩浩荡荡的送葬队伍。他们没有在他的墓碑上铭刻任何光明的诗章，因为他死时天色已然黯淡。","Be it so if you will; but, alas! it was a dream of evil omen for young Goodman Brown.A stern, a sad, a darkly meditative, a distrustful, if not a desperate man did he become from the night of that fearful dream.On the Sabbath day, when the congregation were singing a holy psalm, he could not listen because an anthem of sin rushed loudly upon his ear and drowned all the blessed strain.When the minister spoke from the pulpit with power and fervid eloquence, and, with his hand on the open Bible, of the sacred truths of our religion, and of saint-like lives and triumphant deaths, and of future bliss or misery unutterable, then did Goodman Brown turn pale, dreading lest the roof should thunder down upon the gray blasphemer and his hearers.Often, waking suddenly at midnight, he shrank from the bosom of Faith; and at morning or eventide, when the family knelt down at prayer, he scowled and muttered to himself, and gazed sternly at his wife, and turned away.And when he had lived long, and was borne to his grave a hoary corpse, followed by Faith, an aged woman, and children and grandchildren, a goodly procession, besides neighbors not a few, they carved no hopeful verse upon his tombstone, for his dying hour was gloom."
