"第一章","CHAPTER 1"
"萨默塞特郡凯林奇府的沃尔特•埃利奥特爵士，为了自我娱乐，只看那本《准男爵录》而从不看其他的书；因为这本书，他在闲暇中找到了消遣，烦恼时找到了安慰；因为这本书，他沉思着最早加封的爵位所剩无几，心中不由得升起一股羡慕与崇敬之情；家中的一些事情使他感觉不快，但当他翻阅这本记载着上世纪册封的无穷无尽的爵位的书时，这种不快的感觉便自然而然地化作了怜悯与蔑视；如果所有别的页都很无味的话，那他就总是能自己以经久不衰的兴趣来读自己的家史。他总是把他最心爱的书翻到这一页：","Sir Walter Elliot, of Kellynch Hall, in Somersetshire, was a man who, for his own amusement, never took up any book but the Baronetage; there he found occupation for an idle hour, and consolation in a distressed one; there his faculties were roused into admiration and respect, by contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents; there any unwelcome sensations, arising from domestic affairs changed naturally into pity and contempt as he turned over the almost endless creations of the last century; and there, if every other leaf were powerless, he could read his own history with an interest which never failed.This was the page at which the favourite volume always opened:"
"“凯林奇府的埃利奥特。","“ELLIOT OF KELLYNCH HALL."
"“沃尔特•埃利奥特，1760年3月1日出生，1784年7月15日与格洛斯特郡南方庄园的詹姆斯•史蒂文森先生之女伊丽莎白结婚。这位夫人（卒于1800年）为他留有以下后嗣：伊丽莎白，生于1785年6月1日；安妮，生于1787年8月9日；一个死产儿，1789年11月5日；玛丽，生于1791年11月20日。”","“Walter Elliot, born March 1, 1760, married, July 15, 1784, Elizabeth, daughter of James Stevenson, Esq.of South Park, in the county of Gloucester, by which lady (who died 1800) he has issue Elizabeth, born June 1, 1785; Anne, born August 9, 1787; a still-born son, November 5, 1789; Mary, born November 20, 1791.”"
"准确地说，这是《准男爵录》上排印的文字，但是沃尔特爵士为了给自己和家人提供资料，通过补充美化了一下，在玛丽的生辰后面加上了一句——“1810年12月16日与萨默塞特郡上阿珀克劳斯的查尔斯•马斯格罗夫的儿子兼继承人查尔斯结婚”，并且极为确切地插入了自己丧偶的日期。","Precisely such had the paragraph originally stood from the printer’s hands; but Sir Walter had improved it by adding, for the information of himself and his family, these words, after the date of Mary’s birth—“Married, December 16, 1810, Charles, son and heir of Charles Musgrove, Esq.of Uppercross, in the county of Somerset,” and by inserting most accurately the day of the month on which he had lost his wife."
"接下来便是源远流长的名门望族的发迹史，表述不免落于俗套：最初如何到柴郡定居，如何在担任郡长之职时载入达格代尔的史册，如何代表行政区接连担任了三届议会议员，竭尽全力，忠心耿耿，升官进爵，在查尔斯二世继位后的第一年，先后娶了那些玛丽小姐、伊丽莎白小姐；这些占了满满的十二开本的两页，最后附上了族徽与徽文——“主要邸宅：萨默塞特郡凯林奇府”。最后又出现了沃尔特爵士的笔迹：","Then followed the history and rise of the ancient and respectable family, in the usual terms; how it had been first settled in Cheshire; how mentioned in Dugdale, serving the office of high sheriff, representing a borough in three successive parliaments, exertions of loyalty, and dignity of baronet, in the first year of Charles II, with all the Marys and Elizabeths they had married; forming altogether two handsome duodecimo pages, and concluding with the arms and motto:—“Principal seat, Kellynch Hall, in the county of Somerset,” and Sir Walter’s handwriting again in this finale:—"
"“假定继承人：威廉•沃尔特•埃利奥特先生，第二代沃尔特爵士的曾孙。”","“Heir presumptive, William Walter Elliot, Esq., great grandson of the second Sir Walter.”"
"沃尔特•埃利奥特爵士秉性爱慕虚荣，他为自己的仪表堂堂和优越地位感到自命不凡。他年轻的时候非常英俊；现在到了54岁依旧一表人才。就是女人当中也几乎没人像他那样如此注重自己的仪表，而他对自己社会地位的满意程度，连新获封爵位的贵族的侍从也望尘莫及。他认为堂堂仪表仅次于准男爵的爵位；而两者兼而有之的沃尔特•埃利奥特爵士一直是他非常敬重与热爱的对象。","Vanity was the beginning and the end of Sir Walter Elliot’s character; vanity of person and of situation.He had been remarkably handsome in his youth; and, at fifty-four, was still a very fine man.Few women could think more of their personal appearance than he did, nor could the valet of any new made lord be more delighted with the place he held in society.He considered the blessing of beauty as inferior only to the blessing of a baronetcy; and the Sir Walter Elliot, who united these gifts, was the constant object of his warmest respect and devotion."
"他的美貌与地位使他理所当然地有权利拥有爱情。也正是因为这两点，他才拥有了一位人品远远超越于他自己的妻子。埃利奥特夫人曾是一位优秀的女人，她通情达理而又和蔼可亲；只因年轻时感情上的一时冲动而成为埃利奥特夫人，如果这一点可以原谅，那么她以后的是非判断和待人处事倒也无可厚非。——十七年来，她总是迁就、弥补或掩饰丈夫的不足，激发他真正的可敬之处；而且她自己虽说并不是这个世界上最幸福的人，但她能够在履行职责、结交朋友与照顾孩子中找到足够的乐趣，对生活产生深深的依恋，因而当上帝要她离开他们的时候，她无论如何都不会感到泰然了。——一个母亲留下三个女儿，两个大的16岁，小的14岁，这是一笔骇人的遗产，而把她们留给一个自鸣得意而又愚蠢糊涂的父亲照管与教导，更是一个可怕的托付。不过，她有一个密友，那是一个通情达理而又可以依靠的女人，因为对埃利奥特夫人怀有深厚的感情，便搬到凯林奇村埃利奥特夫人家附近居住。埃利奥特夫人主要依靠这位好朋友的仁慈与指点，从而获得了帮助并维护了她自己一向竭力给她的女儿们灌输的正确原则，对女儿们进行了谆谆教导。","His good looks and his rank had one fair claim on his attachment; since to them he must have owed a wife of very superior character to any thing deserved by his own.Lady Elliot had been an excellent woman, sensible and amiable; whose judgement and conduct, if they might be pardoned the youthful infatuation which made her Lady Elliot, had never required indulgence afterwards.—She had humoured, or softened, or concealed his failings, and promoted his real respectability for seventeen years; and though not the very happiest being in the world herself, had found enough in her duties, her friends, and her children, to attach her to life, and make it no matter of indifference to her when she was called on to quit them.—Three girls, the two eldest sixteen and fourteen, was an awful legacy for a mother to bequeath, an awful charge rather, to confide to the authority and guidance of a conceited, silly father.She had, however, one very intimate friend, a sensible, deserving woman, who had been brought, by strong attachment to herself, to settle close by her, in the village of Kellynch; and on her kindness and advice, Lady Elliot mainly relied for the best help and maintenance of the good principles and instruction which she had been anxiously giving her daughters."
"这位朋友与沃尔特爵士并未结婚，尽管他们的亲朋好友对此有过期待。埃利奥特夫人已去世十三年了，他们仍然只是近邻与密友，一个仍是鳏夫，一个还是寡妇。","This friend, and Sir Walter, did not marry, whatever might have been anticipated on that head by their acquaintance.Thirteen years had passed away since Lady Elliot’s death, and they were still near neighbours and intimate friends, and one remained a widower, the other a widow."
"这位拉塞尔夫人已经到了老成持重的年龄，生活条件极其优越，不会考虑再婚，这也不需向公众解释，其实一个寡妇改嫁比守寡更易引起人们无端的不满，但是沃尔特爵士仍然还是单身这一点却需要解释一下。要知道，沃尔特爵士认为，作为一个好父亲（曾经由于荒唐的求婚而私下碰过一两次钉子），为了几个宝贝女儿而保持单身，是件值得自豪的事。为了一个女儿，他的大女儿，他倒真愿意放弃一切，只不过至今他还不是很愿意那样做罢了。伊丽莎白16岁时已经从母亲那里继承了她可能继承的一切权利与地位；她很漂亮，长得很像她的父亲，因而她的影响力一直很大，他们父女俩相处得很融洽。他的另外两个女儿可就远远不如大女儿宝贝了。玛丽成为了查尔斯•马斯格罗夫太太，获得了某种徒有其表的地位；而安妮，尽管人品高雅，性格温柔，任何真正明白事理的人本应该都很尊重她，然而父亲与姐姐却没有把她放在眼里；她的意见无足轻重，她的安逸总是可以牺牲——她只不过是安妮罢了。","That Lady Russell, of steady age and character, and extremely well provided for, should have no thought of a second marriage, needs no apology to the public, which is rather apt to be unreasonably discontented when a woman does marry again, than when she does not; but Sir Walter’s continuing in singleness requires explanation.Be it known then, that Sir Walter, like a good father, (having met with one or two private disappointments in very unreasonable applications), prided himself on remaining single for his dear daughters’ sake.For one daughter, his eldest, he would really have given up any thing, which he had not been very much tempted to do.Elizabeth had succeeded, at sixteen, to all that was possible, of her mother’s rights and consequence; and being very handsome, and very like himself, her influence had always been great, and they had gone on together most happily.His two other children were of very inferior value.Mary had acquired a little artificial importance, by becoming Mrs. Charles Musgrove; but Anne, with an elegance of mind and sweetness of character, which must have placed her high with any people of real understanding, was nobody with either father or sister; her word had no weight, her convenience was always to give way—she was only Anne."
"对于拉塞尔夫人来说，安妮实在是最可爱、她最器重的教女、宠儿与朋友。拉塞尔夫人对三个姑娘都很喜欢；但是只有在安妮的身上，她才能看到她们母亲的影子。","To Lady Russell, indeed, she was a most dear and highly valued god-daughter, favourite, and friend.Lady Russell loved them all; but it was only in Anne that she could fancy the mother to revive again."
"几年前，安妮•埃利奥特还是位非常漂亮的女孩，但是她的青春年华却早已逝去。即使是在她风华正茂的时候，她父亲在她身上也没有发现什么值得赞赏的地方（她精致的容貌以及温柔的黑眼睛一点也不像他），现在她美艳消褪，消瘦不堪，当然更没有什么可以值得他珍视了。至于能否在他那本心爱的书的任何一页上看到安妮的名字，他从来不抱任何希望，现在更是完全失望了。要结成一起门当户对的姻缘，只能依靠伊丽莎白了，因为玛丽只不过嫁给了一个有钱有势的乡绅人家，因此所有的荣耀都给了婆家，自己却什么都没得到。有朝一日，伊丽莎白会嫁个门当户对的人家。","A few years before, Anne Elliot had been a very pretty girl, but her bloom had vanished early; and as even in its height, her father had found little to admire in her, (so totally different were her delicate features and mild dark eyes from his own), there could be nothing in them, now that she was faded and thin, to excite his esteem.He had never indulged much hope, he had now none, of ever reading her name in any other page of his favourite work.All equality of alliance must rest with Elizabeth, for Mary had merely connected herself with an old country family of respectability and large fortune, and had therefore given all the honour and received none: Elizabeth would, one day or other, marry suitably."
"有时会出现这样的情况：一个女人到了29岁倒比十年前更加楚楚动人。而且，一般来说，只要身体健康、无忧无虑，女人到这个年龄还不至于失去任何魅力。伊丽莎白便是这样。她依然是那位漂亮的埃利奥特小姐，就像十三年前一样。因此，沃尔爵士忘记了自己女儿的年龄，倒也情有可原。至少也不能由于他认定别人都已美貌不再，自己却和伊丽莎白青春常驻，就把他视为半傻不傻，因为他可以清楚地看到所有的亲朋好友都在变老。安妮有点憔悴，玛丽皮肤粗糙，左邻右舍更是等而下之，拉塞尔夫人鬓角周围的皱纹在迅速增多，这一切早就让他苦恼不已。","It sometimes happens that a woman is handsomer at twenty-nine than she was ten years before; and, generally speaking, if there has been neither ill health nor anxiety, it is a time of life at which scarcely any charm is lost.It was so with Elizabeth, still the same handsome Miss Elliot that she had begun to be thirteen years ago, and Sir Walter might be excused, therefore, in forgetting her age, or, at least, be deemed only half a fool, for thinking himself and Elizabeth as blooming as ever, amidst the wreck of the good looks of everybody else; for he could plainly see how old all the rest of his family and acquaintance were growing.Anne haggard, Mary coarse, every face in the neighbourhood worsting, and the rapid increase of the crow’s foot about Lady Russell’s temples had long been a distress to him."
"讲到对自身条件的由衷满意，伊丽莎白并不完全像他父亲一样。她已经在凯利奇府当了十三年的女主人，冷静果断地操持家务，这绝不会使人觉得她比实际上年轻。十三年来，她一直以主妇自居，制定家规，带头去乘轻便马车及驷马马车，紧跟着拉塞尔夫人出入乡下所有的客厅与餐室。十三个周而复始的寒冬，在没有几家邻居能够办得起的豪华舞会上，她总是带头领舞；十三个百花盛开的春天，她每年都要随父亲去伦敦呆上几个星期，去享受一下繁华世界的乐趣。这一切她都历历在目，她意识到自己已经29岁了，心中不由得泛起了一丝惆怅与担心；她为自己仍然像过去一样漂亮而感到心满意足，但是她觉得自己正临近危险的年龄，要是拿得准一两年内有位准男爵身份的绅士来向她正式求婚，那她就会欣喜若狂。到那时，她就可以像在少女时代那样充分享受这本宝书带来的快乐，但是现在她并不喜欢这本书。书中总是写着她的出生日期，没有她的结婚日期，而她小妹妹的结婚日期却赫然在目，因此这本书这是个祸害。有好几次，父亲把书翻开搁在她身旁的桌子上，她却眼望着别处，把书合上推到一边。","Elizabeth did not quite equal her father in personal contentment.Thirteen years had seen her mistress of Kellynch Hall, presiding and directing with a self-possession and decision which could never have given the idea of her being younger than she was.For thirteen years had she been doing the honours, and laying down the domestic law at home, and leading the way to the chaise and four, and walking immediately after Lady Russell out of all the drawing-rooms and dining-rooms in the country.Thirteen winters’ revolving frosts had seen her opening every ball of credit which a scanty neighbourhood afforded, and thirteen springs shewn their blossoms, as she travelled up to London with her father, for a few weeks’ annual enjoyment of the great world.She had the remembrance of all this, she had the consciousness of being nine-and-twenty to give her some regrets and some apprehensions; she was fully satisfied of being still quite as handsome as ever, but she felt her approach to the years of danger, and would have rejoiced to be certain of being properly solicited by baronet-blood within the next twelvemonth or two.Then might she again take up the book of books with as much enjoyment as in her early youth, but now she liked it not.Always to be presented with the date of her own birth and see no marriage follow but that of a youngest sister, made the book an evil; and more than once, when her father had left it open on the table near her, had she closed it, with averted eyes, and pushed it away."
"何况，那本书，尤其是书中有关她家的那段史实，总是让她想起一件令人不愉快的往事。那位假定继承人，也就是威廉•沃尔特•埃利奥特先生，他的权利曾得到她父亲宽宏大量的维护，但是这位先生却使她大为失望。","She had had a disappointment, moreover, which that book, and especially the history of her own family, must ever present the remembrance of.The heir presumptive, the very William Walter Elliot, Esq., whose rights had been so generously supported by her father, had disappointed her."
"伊丽莎白还是小女孩的时候，曾听人说起，她要是没有弟弟，埃利奥特便是未来的准男爵，她便打定主意要嫁给他，而她的父亲也一向认为理应如此。威廉小时候，他们并不认识；但是在埃利奥特夫人死后不久，沃尔特先生便主动与他结识。虽然他的主动并没有受到热情的欢迎，但是考虑到年轻人的谦虚和畏缩，他便坚持要与他结交。于是，他们趁着一次到伦敦春游的机会，硬是结识了埃利奥特先生，当时伊丽莎白刚是个含苞待放的少女。","She had, while a very young girl, as soon as she had known him to be, in the event of her having no brother, the future baronet, meant to marry him, and her father had always meant that she should.He had not been known to them as a boy; but soon after Lady Elliot’s death, Sir Walter had sought the acquaintance, and though his overtures had not been met with any warmth, he had persevered in seeking it, making allowance for the modest drawing-back of youth; and, in one of their spring excursions to London, when Elizabeth was in her first bloom, Mr. Elliot had been forced into the introduction."
"他那时候还是一个年轻的小伙子，正在埋头攻读法律；伊丽莎白发现他极其讨人喜欢，便进一步确定了讨他欢心的种种计划。他们邀请他到凯林奇府作客。那年余下的日子里，父女俩一直在讨论他，盼望着他的到来，但是他还是没有来。第二年春天，他们又在城里看到了他，他还是那样讨人喜欢，因此他们再次鼓励他，邀请他，盼望他，然而他还是没来。接着便传来消息，说他结婚了。他并没有让命运屈从于埃利奥特家为继承人定下的家规，而娶了一个出身低微的有钱女子，从而取得了独立自主的地位。","He was at that time a very young man, just engaged in the study of the law; and Elizabeth found him extremely agreeable, and every plan in his favour was confirmed.He was invited to Kellynch Hall; he was talked of and expected all the rest of the year; but he never came.The following spring he was seen again in town, found equally agreeable, again encouraged, invited, and expected, and again he did not come; and the next tidings were that he was married.Instead of pushing his fortune in the line marked out for the heir of the house of Elliot, he had purchased independence by uniting himself to a rich woman of inferior birth."
"沃尔特爵士对此大为不快。作为一家之长，他认为这件事应该与他商量，尤其是他曾在公开场合牵过这位年轻人的手。“因为人家一定已经见过我们俩人在一起，”他说道，“一次在塔特索尔，两次在众议院的休息室里。”他表示不赞成埃利奥特，但是人家显然没有把这件事放在心上。埃利奥特先生并不想赔礼道歉，对沃尔特家不再理睬他表现出一副无所谓的样子，而沃尔特爵士却认为他不值得受到关照：于是他们之间的所有交情都结束了。","Sir Walter has resented it.As the head of the house, he felt that he ought to have been consulted, especially after taking the young man so publicly by the hand; “For they must have been seen together,” he observed, “once at Tattersall’s, and twice in the lobby of the House of Commons.”His disapprobation was expressed, but apparently very little regarded.Mr. Elliot had attempted no apology, and shewn himself as unsolicitous of being longer noticed by the family, as Sir Walter considered him unworthy of it: all acquaintance between them had ceased."
"事隔几年，伊丽莎白想到与埃利奥特先生这件尴尬的往事仍然感到很气愤。本来她就喜欢埃利奥特这个人，但更重要的是他是父亲的继承人。她强烈的家族自豪感使她觉得只有他才能真正配得上沃尔特•埃利奥特爵士的大女儿。所有的准男爵中没有一个使她如此愿意承认能够与她匹配了。然而埃利奥特先生自己却表现得如此悲惨，虽然伊丽莎白眼下（一八一四年夏天）还在为了他的妻子戴黑纱，她却不能承认他值得别人再去理会他。要不是他做出了更糟糕的事情，或许他第一次婚姻的耻辱已经结束了，因为人们没有理由认为它会遗臭万年。但是，好心的朋友爱搬弄是非，告诉爵士父女说，埃利奥特先生曾经极失礼地议论过他们全家，并且对自己的血统和以后将得到的荣誉表示极大的轻蔑与鄙夷。这是不可原谅的。","This very awkward history of Mr. Elliot was still, after an interval of several years, felt with anger by Elizabeth, who had liked the man for himself, and still more for being her father’s heir, and whose strong family pride could see only in him a proper match for Sir Walter Elliot’s eldest daughter.There was not a baronet from A to Z whom her feelings could have so willingly acknowledged as an equal.Yet so miserably had he conducted himself, that though she was at this present time (the summer of 1814) wearing black ribbons for his wife, she could not admit him to be worth thinking of again.The disgrace of his first marriage might, perhaps, as there was no reason to suppose it perpetuated by offspring, have been got over, had he not done worse; but he had, as by the accustomary intervention of kind friends, they had been informed, spoken most disrespectfully of them all, most slightingly and contemptuously of the very blood he belonged to, and the honours which were hereafter to be his own.This could not be pardoned."
"这就是伊丽莎白的思绪与情感。这些就是她力求消除的烦恼，力求抑制的不安。这就是她高雅而单调、富裕而无聊的生活。她长时间平平淡淡地住在乡下这个圈子里，她关心的就是这样一些感情，用这些感情去填补空暇时间，因为她既没有到户外做公益活动的习惯，在家里又没有什么才能或手艺可以填补这样的空暇时间。","Such were Elizabeth Elliot’s sentiments and sensations; such the cares to alloy, the agitations to vary, the sameness and the elegance, the prosperity and the nothingness of her scene of life; such the feelings to give interest to a long, uneventful residence in one country circle, to fill the vacancies which there were no habits of utility abroad, no talents or accomplishments for home, to occupy."
"可是目前，除了这一切，她又开始添加了另一桩心事和烦恼。她的父亲正越来越为钱财而苦恼。伊丽莎白知道，现在父亲要是拿起那本《准男爵录》，那是为了忘掉零售商的高额账单和代理人谢泼德先生讨厌的暗示。凯林奇府的财产是很可观的，但情况并不像沃尔特爵士这位主人想得那么好。埃利奥特夫人在世时，她持家有方，注意节俭，使得沃尔特爵士能做到量入为出。但是随着夫人的辞世，这一切明智之举都已经付诸东流了，从那时起，他就经常入不敷出了。他是不可能节省开销的，他所干的一切都是沃尔特•埃利奥特爵士的身份使然。但是尽管这种做法无可指摘，但他不仅负债累累，而且常常听到人们流言蜚语，因此他再向女儿隐瞒，哪怕只是部分隐瞒，那也是徒劳的。去年春天在城里的时候，他已经给过伊丽莎白一些暗示。他甚至把话说到这种地步：“我们能不能缩减一些开支？你有没有想到有哪些费用我们可以节省？”说句公道话，伊丽莎白起初的确怀着女性常有的忐忑不安的心情，认真地考虑了应该怎么去做，然后提出了两项可节省的开支：一是减少一些不必要的施舍，二是控制住不再为客厅添置新家具。除了这些权宜之计以外，后来她又想出了妙点子，就是以后不再按照往年的惯例给安妮带礼物。然而，这些方法再好也不足以解决真正严重的困境。这不久以后，沃尔特爵士便发现他不得不把全部实情告诉伊丽莎白了。伊丽莎白也提不出更有效的方案了。她同她父亲一样，觉得自己受到了亏待，倒霉透顶。父女俩谁也想不出任何办法，既能节省开支，又能不伤体面，还不至于使他们以无法忍受的方式放弃舒适的生活。","But now, another occupation and solicitude of mind was beginning to be added to these.Her father was growing distressed for money.She knew, that when he now took up the Baronetage, it was to drive the heavy bills of his tradespeople, and the unwelcome hints of Mr. Shepherd, his agent, from his thoughts.The Kellynch property was good, but not equal to Sir Walter’s apprehension of the state required in its possessor.While Lady Elliot lived, there had been method, moderation, and economy, which had just kept him within his income; but with her had died all such right-mindedness, and from that period he had been constantly exceeding it.It had not been possible for him to spend less; he had done nothing but what Sir Walter Elliot was imperiously called on to do; but blameless as he was, he was not only growing dreadfully in debt, but was hearing of it so often, that it became vain to attempt concealing it longer, even partially, from his daughter.He had given her some hints of it the last spring in town; he had gone so far even as to say, “Can we retrench?Does it occur to you that there is any one article in which we can retrench?” and Elizabeth, to do her justice, had, in the first ardour of female alarm, set seriously to think what could be done, and had finally proposed these two branches of economy, to cut off some unnecessary charities, and to refrain from new furnishing the drawing-room; to which expedients she afterwards added the happy thought of their taking no present down to Anne, as had been the usual yearly custom.But these measures, however good in themselves, were insufficient for the real extent of the evil, the whole of which Sir Walter found himself obliged to confess to her soon afterwards.Elizabeth had nothing to propose of deeper efficacy.She felt herself ill-used and unfortunate, as did her father; and they were neither of them able to devise any means of lessening their expenses without compromising their dignity, or relinquishing their comforts in a way not to be borne."
"在沃尔特爵士掌握的地产之中，只有一小部分他可以自由处置。但是即使他可以转让所有的地产，也无济于事。他已尽力地把他所能抵押的都抵押一空，但是他决不肯纡尊降贵地变卖家产。不，他决不会如此玷污自己的名声的。凯林奇庄园是如何传给他的，他就要如何完完整整地传下去。","There was only a small part of his estate that Sir Walter could dispose of; but had every acre been alienable, it would have made no difference.He had condescended to mortgage as far as he had the power, but he would never condescend to sell.No; he would never disgrace his name so far.The Kellynch estate should be transmitted whole and entire, as he had received it."
"他们的两位密友，一位是住在附近市镇上的谢泼德先生，一位是拉塞尔夫人，他们两位受邀请来帮忙出主意。父女俩似乎期望他们中的某一位能想出什么妙计，使他们既能摆脱困境和减少开支，又不至于失去体面与尊严。","Their two confidential friends, Mr. Shepherd, who lived in the neighbouring market town, and Lady Russell, were called to advise them; and both father and daughter seemed to expect that something should be struck out by one or the other to remove their embarrassments and reduce their expenditure, without involving the loss of any indulgence of taste or pride."
"第二章","CHAPTER 2"
"谢泼德先生是一位彬彬有礼、为人谨慎的律师。不管他对沃尔特爵士有何约束或想法，他都宁愿让别人提出那些令人不快的建议，自己不提出任何微小的暗示，只是请主人允许他大力推崇拉塞尔夫人超人的判断力。他完全相信闻名遐迩的明智的拉塞尔夫人一定会提出一些有力的措施，他希望这些措施能最后被采纳。","Mr. Shepherd, a civil, cautious lawyer, who, whatever might be his hold or his views on Sir Walter, would rather have the disagreeable prompted by anybody else, excused himself from offering the slightest hint, and only begged leave to recommend an implicit reference to the excellent judgement of Lady Russell, from whose known good sense he fully expected to have just such resolute measures advised as he meant to see finally adopted."
"拉塞尔夫人对这件事表现得十分焦急而热心，并为此认真地考虑了一番。与其说她是思维敏捷的人，倒不如说她是做事沉稳的人，她很难在这个问题上做出抉择，因为她思想上存在着两种互相矛盾的指导原则。她本人十分正直诚实，又很讲求信誉，但她又很想照顾沃尔特爵士的情绪，维护这个家族的声誉。她有着贵族意识，觉得他们应该有一些享受，而这是任何明智而正直的人都可能有的想法。她是一个乐善好施的善良妇女，感情强烈，品行端正，恪守礼仪，其言行举止被视为教养有素的典范。她是个有涵养的人，一般而言，她通情达理，意志坚定。但是她对名门贵族有些偏爱，看重社会地位与财富，因而对名门望族的缺点便有点视而不见。她本人不过是一位骑士的遗孀，对一位准男爵自然就极为推崇；沃尔特爵士不仅是她的老朋友、无微不至的邻居、乐于助人的房东、密友的丈夫、安妮姐妹的父亲，而且拉塞尔夫人觉得，他身为沃尔特爵士，理所当然在目前的困境中应得到深切同情与关注。","Lady Russell was most anxiously zealous on the subject, and gave it much serious consideration.She was a woman rather of sound than of quick abilities, whose difficulties in coming to any decision in this instance were great, from the opposition of two leading principles.She was of strict integrity herself, with a delicate sense of honour; but she was as desirous of saving Sir Walter’s feelings, as solicitous for the credit of the family, as aristocratic in her ideas of what was due to them, as anybody of sense and honesty could well be.She was a benevolent, charitable, good woman, and capable of strong attachments, most correct in her conduct, strict in her notions of decorum, and with manners that were held a standard of good-breeding.She had a cultivated mind, and was, generally speaking, rational and consistent; but she had prejudices on the side of ancestry; she had a value for rank and consequence, which blinded her a little to the faults of those who possessed them.Herself the widow of only a knight, she gave the dignity of a baronet all its due; and Sir Walter, independent of his claims as an old acquaintance, an attentive neighbour, an obliging landlord, the husband of her very dear friend, the father of Anne and her sisters, was, as being Sir Walter, in her apprehension, entitled to a great deal of compassion and consideration under his present difficulties."
"他们必须节省开支，这是毋庸置疑的。但是她很想将事情办好，尽量不给沃尔特爵士与伊丽莎白带来痛苦。她制订了种种节约计划，并做了精确的计算，还做出了别人想不到的事情：她征求了安妮的意见，而在别人看来，安妮对这件事情漠不关心，因此可以不必考虑。她征求了安妮的意见，而且在制定节约方案的过程中，在一定程度上还受到了安妮的影响，这份方案最终被交到了沃尔特爵士的手上。安妮的每一次修改意见都实事求是而不考虑排场。她想要采取更强有力的措施，进行一次更加彻底的改革，更快地从债务中解脱出来，听口气，是要更加公平公正，别的事情概不考虑。","They must retrench; that did not admit of a doubt.But she was very anxious to have it done with the least possible pain to him and Elizabeth.She drew up plans of economy, she made exact calculations, and she did what nobody else thought of doing: she consulted Anne, who never seemed considered by the others as having any interest in the question.She consulted, and in a degree was influenced by her in marking out the scheme of retrenchment which was at last submitted to Sir Walter.Every emendation of Anne’s had been on the side of honesty against importance.She wanted more vigorous measures, a more complete reformation, a quicker release from debt, a much higher tone of indifference for everything but justice and equity."
"“如果我们能够说服你的父亲接受这些建议，”拉塞尔夫人看着她的方案说道，“大问题就解决了。如果他愿意采纳这些措施，七年以后他便能够还清债务；我希望我们能够说服他和伊丽莎白，使他们认识到凯利奇府本身是有名望的，这种名望不会因为节省开支而受到影响；埃利奥特爵士的真正尊严不会因为他按原则办事而在明智人的心中受到伤害。事实上，他所要做的事情不就是很多名门望族已经做过或者应该去做的事情吗？他的情况也没有什么特殊的地方，而最常使我们遭受痛苦的，正是这种特殊。我对说服他大有信心。我们必须认真果断，因为毕竟欠债的人必须要还债。尽管我们需要顾及像你父亲这样的一位绅士与一家之长的情绪，但是我们更要顾及一位诚实人的信用。”","“If we can persuade your father to all this,” said Lady Russell, looking over her paper, “much may be done.If he will adopt these regulations, in seven years he will be clear; and I hope we may be able to convince him and Elizabeth, that Kellynch Hall has a respectability in itself which cannot be affected by these reductions; and that the true dignity of Sir Walter Elliot will be very far from lessened in the eyes of sensible people, by acting like a man of principle.What will he be doing, in fact, but what very many of our first families have done, or ought to do?There will be nothing singular in his case; and it is singularity which often makes the worst part of our suffering, as it always does of our conduct.I have great hope of prevailing.We must be serious and decided; for after all, the person who has contracted debts must pay them; and though a great deal is due to the feelings of the gentleman, and the head of a house, like your father, there is still more due to the character of an honest man.”"
"这就是安妮希望父亲遵循的原则，也希望他的朋友们能督促他执行这一原则。她认为采取全面的节省措施、以最快的速度还清一切债务，这是必须承担的义务，不这样做，就没有尊严可谈。她想要把这一点立成规矩，并要求大家将它视为一种职责。她高度评价拉塞尔夫人的作用；至于她之所以凭着良心提出如此严格的自我约束，那是因为她相信，要说服大家进行彻底变革，不见得比说服大家进行局部变革困难多少。纵观拉塞尔夫人那个过于温和的节俭措施，她根据对父亲和伊丽莎白的了解，觉得牺牲一对马带来的痛苦，不见得比两对马全部丧失带来的痛苦少。","This was the principle on which Anne wanted her father to be proceeding, his friends to be urging him.She considered it as an act of indispensable duty to clear away the claims of creditors with all the expedition which the most comprehensive retrenchments could secure, and saw no dignity in anything short of it.She wanted it to be prescribed, and felt as a duty.She rated Lady Russell’s influence highly; and as to the severe degree of self-denial which her own conscience prompted, she believed there might be little more difficulty in persuading them to a complete, than to half a reformation.Her knowledge of her father and Elizabeth inclined her to think that the sacrifice of one pair of horses would be hardly less painful than of both, and so on, through the whole list of Lady Russell’s too gentle reductions."
"安妮那些更为严格的节省措施会引起什么反应，这已经无关紧要了。拉塞尔夫人的建议根本就没有成功：他们无法接受，也无法承受。“什么！把生活中所有的舒适都取消了！旅行、伦敦、仆人、马匹和饭菜——到处都要节俭，都要限制！以后连一个乡居绅士的体面生活都过不上了！不，他宁愿马上离开凯林奇府，也不愿意以这样耻辱的条件继续留在这里。”","How Anne’s more rigid requisitions might have been taken is of little consequence.Lady Russell’s had no success at all: could not be put up with, were not to be borne.“What! every comfort of life knocked off!Journeys, London, servants, horses, table—contractions and restrictions every where!To live no longer with the decencies even of a private gentleman!No, he would sooner quit Kellynch Hall at once, than remain in it on such disgraceful terms.”"
"“离开凯林奇府。”谢泼德先生听出了话音，马上接过话头，他的兴趣在沃尔特爵士真正地节省开支上，他又完全地确信如果不换个住所，什么事都办不成。“既然应该发布命令的人首先提出了这个想法，”他说，“那我也毫无顾虑地承认，我完全赞成这种想法。在我看来，在这一幢需要保持传统体面的好客声誉的府第中，沃尔特爵士难以大刀阔斧地改变生活方式。搬到别的任何地方，沃尔特爵士或许就可以自行安排，不论选择哪种方法安排自己的家务事，改变生活方式，人们都会尊敬他。”","“Quit Kellynch Hall.”The hint was immediately taken up by Mr. Shepherd, whose interest was involved in the reality of Sir Walter’s retrenching, and who was perfectly persuaded that nothing would be done without a change of abode.“Since the idea had been started in the very quarter which ought to dictate, he had no scruple,” he said, “in confessing his judgement to be entirely on that side.It did not appear to him that Sir Walter could materially alter his style of living in a house which had such a character of hospitality and ancient dignity to support.In any other place Sir Walter might judge for himself; and would be looked up to, as regulating the modes of life in whatever way he might choose to model his household.”"
"沃尔特爵士愿意离开凯林奇府。他犹豫不决了几天，便决定了搬家的去向这一重大问题，确定了这一重大变迁的初步方案。","Sir Walter would quit Kellynch Hall; and after a very few days more of doubt and indecision, the great question of whither he should go was settled, and the first outline of this important change made out."
"当时有三个可供选择的地方，伦敦、巴斯以及乡下的另一所房子。安妮满怀希望能选中后者。她所向往的，就是在附近找一所小房子，这样他们仍可以与拉塞尔夫人继续来往，仍与玛丽离得很近，有时还可以看到凯林奇的草坪与树丛。但是关照安妮的是她通常的命运，即事情的结果往往同她的心愿背道而驰。她不喜欢巴斯，觉得那里不适合她，但是巴斯将成为她家新的住地。","There had been three alternatives, London, Bath, or another house in the country.All Anne’s wishes had been for the latter.A small house in their own neighbourhood, where they might still have Lady Russell’s society, still be near Mary, and still have the pleasure of sometimes seeing the lawns and groves of Kellynch, was the object of her ambition.But the usual fate of Anne attended her, in having something very opposite from her inclination fixed on.She disliked Bath, and did not think it agreed with her; and Bath was to be her home."
"沃尔特爵士原本比较倾向于伦敦，但是谢泼德先生觉得他在伦敦让人不放心，便巧妙地劝说他放弃伦敦，选择巴斯。对于一个家道没落的绅士来说，这是一个更保险的地方：在那里他可以相对地少花钱，而又显得很阔绰。两个巴斯较之伦敦重要的优势都发挥了作用：离凯林奇只有十五英里，来往更加方便；拉塞尔夫人每年冬天都会去巴斯住上一段时间。本来拉塞尔夫人在当初考虑迁居的去向问题时，最先考虑的就是巴斯，她对此非常满意。沃尔特爵士和伊丽莎白经过劝说也认为他们搬到那里既不会丢失体面又不会失去生活享受。","Sir Walter had at first thought more of London; but Mr. Shepherd felt that he could not be trusted in London, and had been skilful enough to dissuade him from it, and make Bath preferred.It was a much safer place for a gentleman in his predicament: he might there be important at comparatively little expense.Two material advantages of Bath over London had of course been given all their weight: its more convenient distance from Kellynch, only fifty miles, and Lady Russell’s spending some part of every winter there; and to the very great satisfaction of Lady Russell, whose first views on the projected change had been for Bath, Sir Walter and Elizabeth were induced to believe that they should lose neither consequence nor enjoyment by settling there."
"拉塞尔夫人感到，她不得不违背宝贝安妮表明过的愿望。让沃尔特爵士屈尊搬到临近的小房子是不可能的。安妮自己以后也会发现这种抉择造成的耻辱会超过她的想象，而沃尔特爵士也会觉得这种屈辱必定非常可怕。至于说安妮不喜欢巴斯，拉塞尔夫人认为那是一种偏见与误解。首先，是因为安妮在母亲去世之后，曾在巴斯的学校里上了三年学；其次，由于她后来唯一的一次同拉塞尔夫人去那里过冬时正赶上当时情绪不佳。","Lady Russell felt obliged to oppose her dear Anne’s known wishes.It would be too much to expect Sir Walter to descend into a small house in his own neighbourhood.Anne herself would have found the mortifications of it more than she foresaw, and to Sir Walter’s feelings they must have been dreadful.And with regard to Anne’s dislike of Bath, she considered it as a prejudice and mistake arising, first, from the circumstance of her having been three years at school there, after her mother’s death; and secondly, from her happening to be not in perfectly good spirits the only winter which she had afterwards spent there with herself."
"总之，拉塞尔夫人很喜欢巴斯，并认为这个地方一定会适合大家。说到她年轻朋友的健康，只要和她在凯林奇度过炎热的几个月，所有的危险都可以避免。实际上，换换环境对安妮的健康和精神都会有好处。安妮很少离家外出，别人也很少见到她。她的情绪不高。增加一些社会交往，也许会使她情绪有所好转。她希望有更多的人了解安妮。","Lady Russell was fond of Bath, in short, and disposed to think it must suit them all; and as to her young friend’s health, by passing all the warm months with her at Kellynch Lodge, every danger would be avoided; and it was in fact, a change which must do both health and spirits good.Anne had been too little from home, too little seen.Her spirits were not high.A larger society would improve them.She wanted her to be more known."
"沃尔特爵士之所以不愿意搬进当地的另一所住宅，在很大程度上是考虑了搬迁计划的一项内容，而且是一项重要内容，幸亏从一开始就提出了这一内容。他不仅要离开自己的家，还要看着它落入别人的手中。这是对坚强意志的一种考验，比沃尔特爵士坚强得多的人也会因此感到十分难受。凯林奇府要出租。然而，这是一个极大的秘密，不能泄露给他们圈子以外的人。","The undesirableness of any other house in the same neighbourhood for Sir Walter was certainly much strengthened by one part, and a very material part of the scheme, which had been happily engrafted on the beginning.He was not only to quit his home, but to see it in the hands of others; a trial of fortitude, which stronger heads than Sir Walter’s have found too much.Kellynch Hall was to be let.This, however, was a profound secret, not to be breathed beyond their own circle."
"沃尔特爵士不要人家知道他想出租住宅，他受不了这种屈辱。谢泼德先生曾经提到过“刊登广告”，但是他再也不敢提这件事了。这种想法不管以什么方式提出，都会遭到沃尔特爵士的痛斥，他丝毫不准向别人透露他有这种想法。只有假定有某一位无懈可击的申请者自己主动恳求，他才会按照自己的条件出租凯林奇府，将它作为一个巨大的恩惠。","Sir Walter could not have borne the degradation of being known to design letting his house.Mr. Shepherd had once mentioned the word “advertise,” but never dared approach it again.Sir Walter spurned the idea of its being offered in any manner; forbad the slightest hint being dropped of his having such an intention; and it was only on the supposition of his being spontaneously solicited by some most unexceptionable applicant, on his own terms, and as a great favour, that he would let it at all."
"为了使自己所喜欢的得到认可，人找起理由来还真快！拉塞尔夫人之所以对沃尔特爵士和他的家人搬出乡下感到非常高兴，是因为她手头还有另外一个非常好的理由。伊丽莎白最近结识了一位密友，而拉塞尔夫人希望她中断这种关系。那位是谢泼德先生的女儿，她因婚后生活不美满回到了娘家，还带着两个累赘孩子。她是一个非常聪明的少妇，懂得讨人欢喜的技巧——至少懂得在凯利奇府讨人欢喜的技巧。她自己深得埃利奥特小姐的欢心，尽管拉塞尔夫人认为这段友谊相当不合适，暗示小姐要谨慎和有分寸一些，可是这位朋友已经在府里留宿过不止一次了。","How quick come the reasons for approving what we like!Lady Russell had another excellent one at hand, for being extremely glad that Sir Walter and his family were to remove from the country.Elizabeth had been lately forming an intimacy, which she wished to see interrupted.It was with the daughter of Mr. Shepherd, who had returned, after an unprosperous marriage, to her father’s house, with the additional burden of two children.She was a clever young woman, who understood the art of pleasing—the art of pleasing, at least, at Kellynch Hall; and who had made herself so acceptable to Miss Elliot, as to have been already staying there more than once, in spite of all that Lady Russell, who thought it a friendship quite out of place, could hint of caution and reserve."
"拉塞尔夫人的话对伊丽莎白确实起不了多大作用，不过她看起来还是钟爱伊丽莎白，倒不是因为伊丽莎白值得她爱，而是因为她愿意这样做。拉塞尔夫人从伊丽莎白那里得到的报答，仅仅是表面上的殷勤和顺从罢了。她从来没有说服伊丽莎白克服自己以往的偏见，接受她想要贯彻的主张。她曾经几次三番地争取让安妮跟着他们一起去伦敦旅游，因为把安妮排斥在外的那种自私行为是不公正的、丢人的。在很多比较次要的问题上，她也尽量用自己更好的见解与经验开导伊丽莎白，但总是徒劳无益：伊丽莎白偏要一意孤行。在选择克莱夫人的问题上，她比以往任何时候都更固执地反对拉塞尔夫人。非但不愿亲近品性如此高尚的妹妹，反而将自己的爱与信任给了一位与她没有任何关系，而应以礼相待的人。","Lady Russell, indeed, had scarcely any influence with Elizabeth, and seemed to love her, rather because she would love her, than because Elizabeth deserved it.She had never received from her more than outward attention, nothing beyond the observances of complaisance; had never succeeded in any point which she wanted to carry, against previous inclination.She had been repeatedly very earnest in trying to get Anne included in the visit to London, sensibly open to all the injustice and all the discredit of the selfish arrangements which shut her out, and on many lesser occasions had endeavoured to give Elizabeth the advantage of her own better judgement and experience; but always in vain: Elizabeth would go her own way; and never had she pursued it in more decided opposition to Lady Russell than in this selection of Mrs. Clay; turning from the society of so deserving a sister, to bestow her affection and confidence on one who ought to have been nothing to her but the object of distant civility."
"以拉塞尔夫人来看，从地位上讲，克莱太太与伊丽莎白很不相称。从人品看来，拉塞尔夫人认为她是一个很危险的伙伴。搬家能够把克莱太太甩掉，让埃利奥特小姐在可以接触到的人中选择更为合适的密友。因此搬家便成了头等大事。","From situation, Mrs. Clay was, in Lady Russell’s estimate, a very unequal, and in her character she believed a very dangerous companion; and a removal that would leave Mrs. Clay behind, and bring a choice of more suitable intimates within Miss Elliot’s reach, was therefore an object of first-rate importance."
"第三章","CHAPTER 3"
"“沃尔特爵士，我必须大胆地指出，”一天早晨，谢泼德先生来到凯利奇府，放下手中的报纸说道，“目前的时机对我们非常有利。这次的和平将会使我们所有阔绰的海军军官回到岸上。他们都需要安家。时机再好不过了，沃尔特爵士，你可以挑选房客，非常可靠的房客。战争期间，很多人发了大财。如果我们碰到一个富有的海军上将，沃尔特爵士——”","“I must take leave to observe, Sir Walter,” said Mr. Shepherd one morning at Kellynch Hall, as he laid down the newspaper, “that the present juncture is much in our favour.This peace will be turning all our rich naval officers ashore.They will be all wanting a home.Could not be a better time, Sir Walter, for having a choice of tenants, very responsible tenants.Many a noble fortune has been made during the war.If a rich admiral were to come in our way, Sir Walter—”"
"“那他将是一个非常幸运的人了，谢泼德，”沃尔特爵士答道，“我只能这么说了。凯林奇府对他来说确实是一种奖赏；而且是最高的奖赏，就算他过去得过许多的奖赏。对吧，谢泼德？”","“He would be a very lucky man, Shepherd,” replied Sir Walter; “that’s all I have to remark.A prize indeed would Kellynch Hall be to him; rather the greatest prize of all, let him have taken ever so many before; hey, Shepherd?”"
"听了这番话，谢泼德先生笑了，因为他知道他必须笑，接着他说道：","Mr. Shepherd laughed, as he knew he must, at this wit, and then added—"
"“我冒昧地说，沃尔特爵士，论起做交易来，海军先生们是很好对付的。我曾经对他们做生意的方式多少有些了解，我完全坦白地说，他们出手非常大方，很可能是我们所能遇到的最理想的房客。因此，沃尔特爵士，我冒昧地设想：如果你的打算给泄露出去了——这应该说是可能的，因为我们知道，世上一些人的行动和计划很难逃过另一些人的注意和好奇——因为名誉地位是要付出代价的——我，约翰•谢泼德可以隐瞒我想隐瞒的任何家庭秘密，因为没有人认为值得花费精力来注意我，但沃尔特•埃利奥特爵士却在众目睽睽之下，很难逃脱人们的注意。因此，我可以坦言，尽管我们小心防范，但万一有关事情真相的某种流言传播出去，我也不会大吃一惊。我的意思是，假定真的流传出去，无疑会有人来租房。要是来一位富有的海军军官，那就特别值得欢迎。我还想说，在任何时候，只需要两个小时，你就可以把我召来，免去了你回复的麻烦。”","“I presume to observe, Sir Walter, that, in the way of business, gentlemen of the navy are well to deal with.I have had a little knowledge of their methods of doing business; and I am free to confess that they have very liberal notions, and are as likely to make desirable tenants as any set of people one should meet with.Therefore, Sir Walter, what I would take leave to suggest is, that if in consequence of any rumours getting abroad of your intention; which must be contemplated as a possible thing, because we know how difficult it is to keep the actions and designs of one part of the world from the notice and curiosity of the other; consequence has its tax; I, John Shepherd, might conceal any family-matters that I chose, for nobody would think it worth their while to observe me; but Sir Walter Elliot has eyes upon him which it may be very difficult to elude; and therefore, thus much I venture upon, that it will not greatly surprise me if, with all our caution, some rumour of the truth should get abroad; in the supposition of which, as I was going to observe, since applications will unquestionably follow, I should think any from our wealthy naval commanders particularly worth attending to; and beg leave to add, that two hours will bring me over at any time, to save you the trouble of replying.”"
"沃尔特爵士只是点了点头。但是过了不一会儿，他站起来，在屋里踱着步，讥讽地说道：","Sir Walter only nodded.But soon afterwards, rising and pacing the room, he observed sarcastically—"
"“我想，那些海军军官走进这么豪华的住宅，没有几个人会不感到惊讶的。”","“There are few among the gentlemen of the navy, I imagine, who would not be surprised to find themselves in a house of this description.”"
"“毫无疑问，他们会环顾四周，庆幸他们的好运气，”克莱太太说，克莱太太当时也在场：她搭她父亲的车子来的。没有比坐车来到凯林奇府对克莱太太身体更有益的事情了。“但是，我非常认同我父亲的观点，海军军官是很理想的房客。我对这个职业非常了解；他们除了心胸开阔以外，各个方面都整洁仔细！沃尔特爵士，如果你愿意把这些名贵油画留下，它们也会万无一失。屋里屋外的所有东西都会给料理得井井有条。花园与灌木丛也会被收拾得像现在一样井然有序的。埃利奥特小姐，你也不用担心你自己心爱的小花圃被荒废。”","“They would look around them, no doubt, and bless their good fortune,” said Mrs. Clay, for Mrs. Clay was present: her father had driven her over, nothing being of so much use to Mrs. Clay’s health as a drive to Kellynch: “but I quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might be a very desirable tenant.I have known a good deal of the profession; and besides their liberality, they are so neat and careful in all their ways!These valuable pictures of yours, Sir Walter, if you chose to leave them, would be perfectly safe.Everything in and about the house would be taken such excellent care of!The gardens and shrubberies would be kept in almost as high order as they are now.You need not be afraid, Miss Elliot, of your own sweet flower gardens being neglected.”"
"“至于这个嘛。”沃尔特爵士冷冷地回答说，“即使我受你们的怂恿同意出租住宅，我也还没有拿定主意是否还外加这些优惠条件。我不打算给房客什么特殊待遇。当然，花园会向他开放的，没有几个海军军官或者其他什么人能拥有这么大的花园。但是，对于游乐场所的使用，我会提出哪些限制条件，那是另一回事。我不喜欢别人总是跑到我的灌木丛里去；我会劝说埃利奥特小姐留心着她的花园。我明确地告诉你，我一点也不愿意给予凯林奇府的房客任何特殊的优待，不管他是海军，还是陆军。”","“As to all that,” rejoined Sir Walter coolly, “supposing I were induced to let my house, I have by no means made up my mind as to the privileges to be annexed to it.I am not particularly disposed to favour a tenant.The park would be open to him of course, and few navy officers, or men of any other description, can have had such a range; but what restrictions I might impose on the use of the pleasure-grounds, is another thing.I am not fond of the idea of my shrubberies being always approachable; and I should recommend Miss Elliot to be on her guard with respect to her flower garden.I am very little disposed to grant a tenant of Kellynch Hall any extraordinary favour, I assure you, be he sailor or soldier.”"
"停了一小会儿后，谢泼德先生冒昧地开口说：","After a short pause, Mr. Shepherd presumed to say—"
"“在这些情况下，按一般惯例，可以把房东与房客之间的关系规定得清清楚楚。沃尔特爵士，你的利益掌握在相当可靠的人手中。相信我，我会留神的，不会让房客得到超出他正当权利以外的任何东西。我敢说，沃尔特•埃利奥特爵士对自己利益的关心程度，可能不及约翰•谢泼德对此关心的一半呢。”","“In all these cases, there are established usages which make everything plain and easy between landlord and tenant.Your interest, Sir Walter, is in pretty safe hands.Depend upon me for taking care that no tenant has more than his just rights.I venture to hint, that Sir Walter Elliot cannot be half so jealous for his own, as John Shepherd will be for him.”"
"这时，安妮说话了：","Here Anne spoke—"
"“我觉得，海军为我们做出过很大贡献，他们至少应该像其他人一样，有权享受任何房东可以提供的一切舒适条件和优待。我们大家都应该承认，海军工作很艰苦，他们完全有权享受舒适的生活。”","“The navy, I think, who have done so much for us, have at least an equal claim with any other set of men, for all the comforts and all the privileges which any home can give.Sailors work hard enough for their comforts, we must all allow.”"
"“一点儿不错，一点儿不错。安妮小姐说得千真万确。”谢泼德先生回答道。他的女儿接着说道，“哦，当然。”可是沃尔特爵士随即便说：","“Very true, very true.What Miss Anne says, is very true,” was Mr. Shepherd’s rejoinder, and “Oh! certainly,” was his daughter’s; but Sir Walter’s remark was, soon afterwards—"
"“海军这个职业很有用，但是，要是我的朋友中有人从事了这一职业，我会觉得很遗憾。”","“The profession has its utility, but I should be sorry to see any friend of mine belonging to it.”"
"“真的吗？”对方回答时，脸上露出惊讶的神色。","“Indeed!” was the reply, and with a look of surprise."
"“是的，它有两点使我讨厌。我有两个充分的理由反对它。首先，作为给出身卑微的人带来高殊荣的方式，它使他们得到他们的祖父辈做梦都不敢想的荣誉；其次，它极其可怕地摧毁一个人的青春与精力，海军要比其他任何人老得都要快。这种情形我一生中见得多了。一个人参加海军，比在其他任何行业都更有可能感到屈辱，因为他父亲很可能不屑搭理的人的儿子竟受到了提拔，而他父亲自己却过早地成为被人唾弃的对象。去年春天，一天我在城里遇见了两个人，他们可以为我说的话提供有力的证明。一个是圣艾夫斯勋爵，我们都知道，他父亲过去是一位乡下的副牧师，连面包都吃不上；但是我却要给圣艾夫斯勋爵让路。另一个是鲍德温将军，你可以想象这位显赫之人有多难看；他的脸是红褐色的，皮肤粗糙而凹凸不平，满脸皱纹，两旁各挂着九根灰毛，头顶似乎只有一层发粉。‘天哪，那位老头是谁呀？’我对站在旁边的一位朋友（巴兹尔•莫利爵士）说道。‘老头！’巴兹尔先生喊道，‘那是海军上将鲍德温。你看他有多大年纪？’‘ 60岁，’我说，‘或许是62岁。’‘40岁，’巴兹尔先生回答道，‘仅仅40岁。’你们可以想象出我有多么惊讶；我不会轻易地忘掉海军上将鲍德温。我从来没有见过海上生活能把人折磨得如此凄惨；但是在某种程度上，我知道他们都是这样：他们在海浪中四处颠簸，经受各种气候的考验，任凭风吹雨打，直到被折磨得不成样子。遗憾的是，他们在活到海军上将鲍德温这个年纪之前，没有突然死于非命。”","“Yes; it is in two points offensive to me; I have two strong grounds of objection to it.First, as being the means of bringing persons of obscure birth into undue distinction, and raising men to honours which their fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of; and secondly, as it cuts up a man’s youth and vigour most horribly; a sailor grows old sooner than any other man.I have observed it all my life.A man is in greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise of one whose father, his father might have disdained to speak to, and of becoming prematurely an object of disgust himself, than in any other line.One day last spring, in town, I was in company with two men, striking instances of what I am talking of; Lord St Ives, whose father we all know to have been a country curate, without bread to eat; I was to give place to Lord St Ives, and a certain Admiral Baldwin, the most deplorable-looking personage you can imagine; his face the colour of mahogany, rough and rugged to the last degree; all lines and wrinkles, nine grey hairs of a side, and nothing but a dab of powder at top. ‘In the name of heaven, who is that old fellow?’ said I to a friend of mine who was standing near, (Sir Basil Morley).‘Old fellow!’ cried Sir Basil, ‘it is Admiral Baldwin.What do you take his age to be?’‘Sixty,’ said I, ‘or perhaps sixty-two.’‘Forty,’ replied Sir Basil, ‘forty, and no more.’Picture to yourselves my amazement; I shall not easily forget Admiral Baldwin.I never saw quite so wretched an example of what a sea-faring life can do; but to a degree, I know it is the same with them all: they are all knocked about, and exposed to every climate, and every weather, till they are not fit to be seen.It is a pity they are not knocked on the head at once, before they reach Admiral Baldwin’s age.”"
"“不，沃尔特爵士，”克莱太太喊道，“这话确实很残酷。请稍稍可怜一下那些不幸的人吧。我们大家并非生来就很漂亮。当然，大海并不是美容师，水兵确实老得很快，我已经注意到了这一点，他们很快便失去了青春美貌。不过，其他职业，或许大多数职业，不都一样吗？那些现役步兵情况也好不了多少：甚至是那些稍微安稳的职业，即使不伤身体的话，那么也会伤害头脑，这样就很难使人的面貌只受时间的自然影响。律师勤奋工作，相当憔悴；医生随叫随到，风雨无阻；即使是牧师——”她停了一小会儿，考虑应该如何说明牧师的职业；——“你们知道，即使是牧师也必须要走进传染病房，将自己的健康与相貌暴露在有毒环境的危害之中。实际上，我一直以来都深信不疑，尽管每个职业就其本身来说都是必须的、光荣的，但是只有这些有幸的人，他们无须工作，在乡下过着有规律的生活，自由安排时间，做着自己喜欢的事，靠自己的财产过日子，用不着为获取更多而烦恼。我认为，只有这些人，才有福气充分保持健康和美貌。我认识的其他人，当他们不再年轻时，便失去了几分风度。”","“Nay, Sir Walter,” cried Mrs. Clay, “this is being severe indeed.Have a little mercy on the poor men.We are not all born to be handsome.The sea is no beautifier, certainly; sailors do grow old betimes; I have observed it; they soon lose the look of youth.But then, is not it the same with many other professions, perhaps most other?Soldiers, in active service, are not at all better off: and even in the quieter professions, there is a toil and a labour of the mind, if not of the body, which seldom leaves a man’s looks to the natural effect of time.The lawyer plods, quite care-worn; the physician is up at all hours, and travelling in all weather; and even the clergyman—” she stopt a moment to consider what might do for the clergyman;—“and even the clergyman, you know is obliged to go into infected rooms, and expose his health and looks to all the injury of a poisonous atmosphere.In fact, as I have long been convinced, though every profession is necessary and honourable in its turn, it is only the lot of those who are not obliged to follow any, who can live in a regular way, in the country, choosing their own hours, following their own pursuits, and living on their own property, without the torment of trying for more; it is only their lot, I say, to hold the blessings of health and a good appearance to the utmost: I know no other set of men but what lose something of their personableness when they cease to be quite young.”"
"谢泼德先生如此急切地想要显示出沃尔特爵士对海军军官做房客的好感，似乎他确有先见之明。因为第一位想要承租这房子的就是海军将军克罗夫特，不久以后，谢泼德先生在汤顿参加季会时结识了克罗夫特海军将军。其实，他早就从伦敦的一位记者那里得到了些许有关这位海军将军的消息。根据他匆匆赶回凯林奇所作的报告，海军将军克罗夫特是萨默塞特郡人，攒下了一笔相当可观的财产，想回故乡定居。他到汤顿去，是为了实地看看广告上登载的附近一带的房子，可是这些房子都不合他的心意。后来，他偶尔听到——（谢泼德先生说，正如他先前讲过的，沃尔特爵士迁居计划是无法保密的）——偶尔听到凯林奇府有可能出租并了解到他（谢泼德先生）同房主的关系，就径自找到谢泼德先生了解具体情况。经过相当长时间的晤谈，克罗夫特海军将军根据对方的口头描述，就对这一住所表现出强烈兴趣。克罗夫特海军将军当时还毫不隐晦地做了自我介绍，这使谢泼德先生确实感觉到他是一位十分可靠而又适合的房客。","It seemed as if Mr. Shepherd, in this anxiety to bespeak Sir Walter’s good will towards a naval officer as tenant, had been gifted with foresight; for the very first application for the house was from an Admiral Croft, with whom he shortly afterwards fell into company in attending the quarter sessions at Taunton; and indeed, he had received a hint of the Admiral from a London correspondent.By the report which he hastened over to Kellynch to make, Admiral Croft was a native of Somersetshire, who having acquired a very handsome fortune, was wishing to settle in his own country, and had come down to Taunton in order to look at some advertised places in that immediate neighbourhood, which, however, had not suited him; that accidentally hearing—(it was just as he had foretold, Mr. Shepherd observed, Sir Walter’s concerns could not be kept a secret,)—accidentally hearing of the possibility of Kellynch Hall being to let, and understanding his (Mr. Shepherd’s) connection with the owner, he had introduced himself to him in order to make particular inquiries, and had, in the course of a pretty long conference, expressed as strong an inclination for the place as a man who knew it only by description could feel; and given Mr. Shepherd, in his explicit account of himself, every proof of his being a most responsible, eligible tenant."
"“克罗夫特将军是谁？”沃尔特爵士以一种冷淡和猜疑的口吻问道。","“And who is Admiral Croft?” was Sir Walter’s cold suspicious inquiry."
"谢泼德先生担保说，克罗夫特将军出身于绅士之家，而且他还提到了一个地点。停了片刻，安妮补充说：","Mr. Shepherd answered for his being of a gentleman’s family, and mentioned a place; and Anne, after the little pause which followed, added—"
"“他是白色中队的海军少将。他参加过特拉法尔加战役，从那以后就一直呆在东印度群岛。我想，他已经在那里驻守了好几年。”","“He is a rear admiral of the white.He was in the Trafalgar action, and has been in the East Indies since; he was stationed there, I believe, several years.”"
"“这么说来，”沃尔特爵士说道，“他的脸色一定像我家仆人的制服袖子和短斗蓬一样蜡黄。”","“Then I take it for granted,” observed Sir Walter, “that his face is about as orange as the cuffs and capes of my livery.”"
"谢泼德先生马上保证说，克罗夫特将军是一位体格健壮、相貌堂堂的男子汉，确实有点饱经风霜，但并不很难看，他的见解和为人颇有绅士风度。看来在租房条件方面不会太难为沃尔特爵士，他只想要一个舒适的家，希望尽快搬进去。他知道要舒适就要付出代价；他知道住这种设备齐全的住所要付多少房租；即使沃尔特爵士要价更高，他也不会感到惊讶。他还问起了住宅附属的庄园，当然也愿意代为管理，但没有坚持这一想法。他说，过去他偶尔出去狩猎，但从未伤害过任何动物。他完全是个绅士。","Mr. Shepherd hastened to assure him, that Admiral Croft was a very hale, hearty, well-looking man, a little weather-beaten, to be sure, but not much, and quite the gentleman in all his notions and behaviour; not likely to make the smallest difficulty about terms, only wanted a comfortable home, and to get into it as soon as possible; knew he must pay for his convenience; knew what rent a ready-furnished house of that consequence might fetch; should not have been surprised if Sir Walter had asked more; had inquired about the manor; would be glad of the deputation, certainly, but made no great point of it; said he sometimes took out a gun, but never killed; quite the gentleman."
"谢泼德先生滔滔不绝地说着这个话题，将海军少将的各种家庭情况统统都抖了出来，以显示他是一个再理想不过的房客。他结了婚又没有孩子，这真是再好不过的情况了。谢泼德先生说，没有女主人，房子永远也不会被照料好的：他不知道，家里没有女主人与有很多孩子相比，哪种情况会使家具损坏得更多。一位没有子女的太太是这个世界上最好的家具保护者。他也见过克罗夫特夫人；她和海军将军一起来到汤顿，在他们讨论这件事时，克罗夫特太太几乎始终在场。","Mr. Shepherd was eloquent on the subject; pointing out all the circumstances of the Admiral’s family, which made him peculiarly desirable as a tenant.He was a married man, and without children; the very state to be wished for.A house was never taken good care of, Mr. Shepherd observed, without a lady: he did not know, whether furniture might not be in danger of suffering as much where there was no lady, as where there were many children.A lady, without a family, was the very best preserver of furniture in the world.He had seen Mrs. Croft, too; she was at Taunton with the admiral, and had been present almost all the time they were talking the matter over."
"“看上去，她是一位善于辞令、温文尔雅、精明过人的太太，”谢泼德先生接着说道，“她对于房子、出租条件以及税款提出了更多的问题，这比海军将军本人提的还多，看起来对生意更为内行。另外，沃尔特爵士，我发现她并不像她的丈夫一样，在这儿完全无亲无故；这就是说，她是曾经住在我们这一带的一位绅士的姐姐；她亲口对我说的：她是几年前住在蒙克福德的一位绅士的亲姐姐。我的天哪！他叫什么名字来着？我一时记不起他的名字了，可是不久前我还听到有人提起这个名字。我亲爱的佩内洛普，你能帮我想起曾经住在蒙克福德的那位绅士——克罗夫特太太的弟弟的名字吗？”","“And a very well-spoken, genteel, shrewd lady, she seemed to be,” continued he; “asked more questions about the house, and terms, and taxes, than the Admiral himself, and seemed more conversant with business; and moreover, Sir Walter, I found she was not quite unconnected in this country, any more than her husband; that is to say, she is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us once; she told me so herself: sister to the gentleman who lived a few years back at Monkford.Bless me! what was his name?At this moment I cannot recollect his name, though I have heard it so lately.Penelope, my dear, can you help me to the name of the gentleman who lived at Monkford: Mrs. Croft’s brother?”"
"但是克莱太太正与埃利奥特小姐谈得非常起劲，没有听到谢泼德先生的请求。","But Mrs. Clay was talking so eagerly with Miss Elliot, that she did not hear the appeal."
"“我不知道你说的是谁，谢泼德。自从老特伦特出任郡长以来，我不记得有哪位绅士在蒙克福德住过。”","“I have no conception whom you can mean, Shepherd; I remember no gentleman resident at Monkford since the time of old Governor Trent.”"
"“我的天哪！好奇怪啊！我想，用不了多久，我连自己的名字也会忘掉的。这是我如此熟悉的一个名字，我曾多次见过这位绅士，足有一百次，我记得曾经有一次他来征求我对他邻居非法闯入的看法，农场主的雇工闯入他的果园，推倒了围墙，偷走了苹果，被当场抓住，后来这位绅士并没有采纳我的意见，而作出了友好妥协。确实真够奇怪的！”","“Bless me! how very odd!I shall forget my own name soon, I suppose.A name that I am so very well acquainted with; knew the gentleman so well by sight; seen him a hundred times; came to consult me once, I remember, about a trespass of one of his neighbours; farmer’s man breaking into his orchard; wall torn down; apples stolen; caught in the fact; and afterwards, contrary to my judgement, submitted to an amicable compromise.Very odd indeed!”"
"大家又沉默了一会儿——","After waiting another moment—"
"“我想，你说得是温特沃思先生吧？”安妮说道。","“You mean Mr. Wentworth, I suppose?” said Anne."
"谢泼德先生感激万分。","Mr. Shepherd was all gratitude."
"“正是温特沃思这个名字！那个人就是温特沃思先生。你知道，沃尔特爵士，温特沃思先生以前在蒙克福德做了两三年的副牧师。我想，他大约是1805年来到这儿的。我肯定你还记得他。”","“Wentworth was the very name!Mr. Wentworth was the very man.He had the curacy of Monkford, you know, Sir Walter, some time back, for two or three years.Came there about the year—-5, I take it.You remember him, I am sure.”"
"“温特沃思？啊！对了——温特沃思先生，蒙克福德的副牧师。你用绅士这个字眼把我弄糊涂了。我还以为你在谈论哪一位有产者呢：我记得，温特沃思先生是个无名之辈，没有什么显赫的亲戚；跟斯特拉福德家族毫无关系。真怪，我们许多贵族的姓氏竟然会变得这么无足轻重！”","“Wentworth?Oh! ay,—Mr. Wentworth, the curate of Monkford.You misled me by the term gentleman.I thought you were speaking of some man of property: Mr. Wentworth was nobody, I remember; quite unconnected; nothing to do with the Strafford family.One wonders how the names of many of our nobility become so common.”"
"谢泼德先生发现，克罗夫特夫妇的这位亲戚没在沃尔特爵士心目中留下好印象，就不再提起他了。而将话锋一转，滔滔不绝地谈起无疑能引起沃尔特爵士好感的有利条件；他们的年龄、家中的人口、财产；他们对凯利奇府的良好印象，唯恐自己租不到手；听起来，他们把能当上沃尔特•埃利奥特爵士的房客视为莫大的幸福：当然，他们竟然能够猜中沃尔特爵士内心对房客应有品德的要求，可见他们夫妇的非凡识别力。","As Mr. Shepherd perceived that this connexion of the Crofts did them no service with Sir Walter, he mentioned it no more; returning, with all his zeal, to dwell on the circumstances more indisputably in their favour; their age, and number, and fortune; the high idea they had formed of Kellynch Hall, and extreme solicitude for the advantage of renting it; making it appear as if they ranked nothing beyond the happiness of being the tenants of Sir Walter Elliot: an extraordinary taste, certainly, could they have been supposed in the secret of Sir Walter’s estimate of the dues of a tenant."
"事情终究还是成功了，尽管沃尔特爵士对任何希望承租的房客都怀有敌意，并且认为即使这些人出最高价来租赁房子，仍然太便宜了他们，但是在众人的劝说下，他还是同意谢泼德先生继续进行谈判，并全权委托他接待还在汤顿的克罗夫海军上将，商定看房日期。","It succeeded, however; and though Sir Walter must ever look with an evil eye on anyone intending to inhabit that house, and think them infinitely too well off in being permitted to rent it on the highest terms, he was talked into allowing Mr. Shepherd to proceed in the treaty, and authorising him to wait on Admiral Croft, who still remained at Taunton, and fix a day for the house being seen."
"沃尔特爵士并不是非常聪明，但是他凭着自己丰富的阅历还是感觉到，从各种基本条件来看，比可能承租的克罗夫特将军更加无可非议的房客，是不大可能提出申请的。他的判断力也仅此而已；不过将军的社会地位也给他的虚荣心增添了几分安慰，因为克罗夫特将军的社会地位高得恰如其分，而并不过分显赫。“我已经把房子租给了克罗夫特将军。”这话听起来相当体面；比说租给普通的某某先生体面多了；某位先生（或许全国除了五六个以外）总是需要做点注释说明。将军这个头衔本身就表明了他的地位，而且同时又绝不会有损一位准男爵的身价。在双方所有的谈判与交往中，沃尔特•埃利奥特爵士理应处于优胜者的地位。","Sir Walter was not very wise; but still he had experience enough of the world to feel, that a more unobjectionable tenant, in all essentials, than Admiral Croft bid fair to be, could hardly offer.So far went his understanding; and his vanity supplied a little additional soothing, in the Admiral’s situation in life, which was just high enough, and not too high.“I have let my house to Admiral Croft,” would sound extremely well; very much better than to any mere Mr—; a Mr. (save, perhaps, some half dozen in the nation,) always needs a note of explanation.An admiral speaks his own consequence, and, at the same time, can never make a baronet look small.In all their dealings and intercourse, Sir Walter Elliot must ever have the precedence."
"不听取伊丽莎白的意见，是什么事情也办不成的；但是她想搬家的心情变得越来越迫切了，现在有了愿意承租的房客，就可以确定并且促成搬迁的事情，她自然非常高兴，压根儿没有提出有碍这一决定的意见。","Nothing could be done without a reference to Elizabeth: but her inclination was growing so strong for a removal, that she was happy to have it fixed and expedited by a tenant at hand; and not a word to suspend decision was uttered by her."
"他们委托谢泼德先生全权办理；这一决定刚一作出，原来始终专心倾听着别人讨论的安妮就离开了房间，去呼吸呼吸凉爽的空气，因为她满脸通红了。她沿着心爱的小树丛漫步，轻轻叹了口气，说道：“再过几个月，也许他就会在这里散步了。”　","Mr. Shepherd was completely empowered to act; and no sooner had such an end been reached, than Anne, who had been a most attentive listener to the whole, left the room, to seek the comfort of cool air for her flushed cheeks; and as she walked along a favourite grove, said, with a gentle sigh, “A few months more, and he, perhaps, may be walking here.”"
"第四章","CHAPTER 4"
"不管外表看起来多么令人可疑，他都不是蒙克福德以前的副牧师——温特沃思先生，而是副牧师的弟弟弗雷德里克•温特沃思海军上校。他在圣多明戈附近的海战后，被晋升为海军中校，但没有马上得到任命，便于1806年夏天来到了萨默塞特郡。他父母双亡，在蒙克福德租了个房子住了半年。当时，他是一个出类拔萃的好青年，聪明过人，朝气蓬勃而才华横溢；而安妮是一个美丽动人的姑娘，性格温柔，端庄娴静，品味高雅，感情丰富。双方各具备一半的吸引力就已经足够了，因为他无事可做，而她的情感当时几乎无处寄托；但是双方有这么多优点，邂逅之后应该不会错过的。他们俩逐渐熟悉起来，而一旦熟识，他们便迅速地陷入热恋。很难说究竟是哪一方的倾慕之心更加强烈，或哪一方更为幸福：是听到弗雷德里克的表白和求婚时的安妮呢，还是求婚被安妮接受时的弗雷德里克呢。","He was not Mr. Wentworth, the former curate of Monkford, however suspicious appearances may be, but a Captain Frederick Wentworth, his brother, who being made commander in consequence of the action off St Domingo, and not immediately employed, had come into Somersetshire, in the summer of 1806; and having no parent living, found a home for half a year at Monkford.He was, at that time, a remarkably fine young man, with a great deal of intelligence, spirit, and brilliancy; and Anne an extremely pretty girl, with gentleness, modesty, taste, and feeling.Half the sum of attraction, on either side, might have been enough, for he had nothing to do, and she had hardly anybody to love; but the encounter of such lavish recommendations could not fail.They were gradually acquainted, and when acquainted, rapidly and deeply in love.It would be difficult to say which had seen highest perfection in the other, or which had been the happiest: she, in receiving his declarations and proposals, or he in having them accepted."
"他们快乐的热恋很短暂，确实很短暂。很快麻烦就出现了。当年轻人向沃尔特爵士提亲时，他既没有正式表示不同意，也没有说绝不可能，而是以极端的惊讶、冷淡和沉默表示反对，并且明确表示不会为他女儿做任何事情。他认为这是一桩很丢人的婚事；尽管拉塞尔夫人比爵士沉着冷静，而且也觉得情有可原，然而也认为这桩婚事是极为不幸的。","A short period of exquisite felicity followed, and but a short one.Troubles soon arose.Sir Walter, on being applied to, without actually withholding his consent, or saying it should never be, gave it all the negative of great astonishment, great coldness, great silence, and a professed resolution of doing nothing for his daughter.He thought it a very degrading alliance; and Lady Russell, though with more tempered and pardonable pride, received it as a most unfortunate one."
"安妮•埃利奥特出身高贵，才貌双全，19岁便要断送自己的一生。19岁就要与一个年轻人订婚，而这个年轻人除了自己之外一无所有，也没有发财致富的希望，只能靠极不稳定的职业上的机遇，他甚至没有什么裙带关系来保证他在这一职业中继续获得升迁，拉塞尔夫人一想到这里就十分伤心！安妮•埃利奥特这么年轻，没有几个人见过她，现在要被一个没有显赫亲戚与财产的陌生人抢走；或者被他拖累到疲惫不堪、焦虑不安、青春耗尽的从属地步！这绝不行，如果用友谊和一个对她拥有母爱和母亲权利的人的身份去正当地干预，或许可以阻止这桩婚事。","Anne Elliot, with all her claims of birth, beauty, and mind, to throw herself away at nineteen; involve herself at nineteen in an engagement with a young man, who had nothing but himself to recommend him, and no hopes of attaining affluence, but in the chances of a most uncertain profession, and no connexions to secure even his farther rise in the profession, would be, indeed, a throwing away, which she grieved to think of！Anne Elliot, so young; known to so few, to be snatched off by a stranger without alliance or fortune; or rather sunk by him into a state of most wearing, anxious, youth-killing dependence!It must not be, if by any fair interference of friendship, any representations from one who had almost a mother’s love, and mother’s rights, it would be prevented."
"温特沃思海军上校没有财产。他在事业上是幸运的，不过钱财来得容易，花得也快，他没有分文积蓄。但是他坚信他很快便会富起来：他朝气蓬勃，热情澎湃，他知道自己不久便会有一艘舰艇，很快便会谋得通向他所向往的一切的职位。他过去一直是幸运的；他知道将来也会如此。这种信心本身就非常强烈，他又将其表达得如此风趣诙谐，令人心醉，对安妮来说，这就足够了。但是拉塞尔夫人的看法却大不相同。弗雷德里克那乐观的性格和大无畏的精神，给拉塞尔夫人留下了截然不同的印象。她认为这只不过是罪孽的恶性发展。这只能给他的性格蒙上一层危险的阴影。他才华横溢但却刚愎自用。拉塞尔夫人不大欣赏诙谐，对任何轻率的举动都非常厌恶。无论从哪方面看，她都反对这桩婚事。","Captain Wentworth had no fortune.He had been lucky in his profession; but spending freely, what had come freely, had realized nothing.But he was confident that he should soon be rich: full of life and ardour, he knew that he should soon have a ship, and soon be on a station that would lead to everything he wanted.He had always been lucky; he knew he should be so still.Such confidence, powerful in its own warmth, and bewitching in the wit which often expressed it, must have been enough for Anne; but Lady Russell saw it very differently.His sanguine temper, and fearlessness of mind, operated very differently on her.She saw in it but an aggravation of the evil.It only added a dangerous character to himself.He was brilliant, he was headstrong.Lady Russell had little taste for wit, and of anything approaching to imprudence a horror.She deprecated the connexion in every light."
"这些感情引起的强烈的反对情绪超过了安妮的承受能力。她虽然年轻温柔，但是对于父亲的对立情绪，她还是有可能抵抗住的，哪怕姐姐没说一句同情的话或使一个同情的眼色来缓解这一情绪。但是她一向热爱和信赖的拉塞尔夫人这么坚决，这么慈祥地不断劝说，却不能不对她产生影响。安妮被说服了，相信这次订婚是一件错误的事情：轻率，不恰当，不会成功，也不值得成功。但是安妮能中断这一关系，并不仅仅出于自私的考虑。如果不是她以为这样做更多的是为弗雷德里克，而不是为自己考虑，她可能根本不会放弃他。她相信自己这样慎重，自我克制，主要是为了他好，这是她忍痛与他分手，也是最终分手的主要慰藉。她当时的确非常需要慰藉，她不得不承受所有额外的痛苦，因为弗雷德里克不仅根本不相信她的动机，而且十分固执，觉得自己因被迫中断婚约而受到了侮辱。结果，他离开了萨默塞特郡。","Such opposition, as these feelings produced, was more than Anne could combat.Young and gentle as she was, it might yet have been possible to withstand her father’s ill-will, though unsoftened by one kind word or look on the part of her sister; but Lady Russell, whom she had always loved and relied on, could not, with such steadiness of opinion, and such tenderness of manner, be continually advising her in vain.She was persuaded to believe the engagement a wrong thing: indiscreet, improper, hardly capable of success, and not deserving it.But it was not a merely selfish caution, under which she acted, in putting an end to it.Had she not imagined herself consulting his good, even more than her own, she could hardly have given him up.The belief of being prudent, and self-denying, principally for his advantage, was her chief consolation, under the misery of a parting, a final parting; and every consolation was required, for she had to encounter all the additional pain of opinions, on his side, totally unconvinced and unbending, and of his feeling himself ill used by so forced a relinquishment.He had left the country in consequence."
"他们的相识，从开始到结束只有几个月；但是安妮为此而承受的痛苦却不是几个月就能消逝的。很长一段时间以来，她的痴情与悔恨阴云般笼罩在她心头，使她享受不到青春的快乐，使她早早地失去了青春的艳丽与热情。","A few months had seen the beginning and the end of their acquaintance; but not with a few months ended Anne’s share of suffering from it.Her attachment and regrets had, for a long time, clouded every enjoyment of youth, and an early loss of bloom and spirits had been their lasting effect."
"这段令人悲痛的短暂历史已经过去七年多了。时间大大地冲淡了，或许几乎全部抹去了对他的专一爱情。但是安妮依赖的完全是时光的推移；住所的变更（她只是在终止婚约后不久去过巴斯一次），或新的、更广泛的社会交往，都对她毫无帮助。凡是进入凯林奇社交圈的人，没有一个可以同她记忆中的弗雷德里克相提并论。在她这个年纪，第二次恋爱是唯一能十分自然地、幸福而彻底地医治心灵创伤的良药，但是在当时有限的社交环境中，安妮那高雅的格调、挑剔的情绪，使她难以再次产生这样的感情。当她大约22岁的时候，有位年轻人曾向她求婚，但是不久之后，这位年轻人却发现她妹妹更加愿意和他共结琴瑟之好。拉塞尔夫人对她的拒绝表示惋惜；因为查尔斯•马斯格罗夫是个长子，他父亲的地产与地位在那一带仅次于沃尔特爵士，而且他人品优秀、仪表堂堂。如果安妮19岁，拉塞尔夫人也许要求高一些，可是安妮已经22岁了，她很愿意看到安妮体面地摆脱娘家的偏心和不公平，在她附近永久地定居下来。不过这一次，安妮一点劝告也听不进去，尽管拉塞尔夫人对自己所做的决定一向是满意的，而且从不后悔，但是这一次她却有些忐忑不安了，她觉得安妮感情热烈、善于持家，特别适合过小家庭生活，可现在恐怕没有希望使她被哪位富有才干、独立自主的男子所打动，与他结成美满姻缘了。","More than seven years were gone since this little history of sorrowful interest had reached its close; and time had softened down much, perhaps nearly all of peculiar attachment to him, but she had been too dependent on time alone; no aid had been given in change of place (except in one visit to Bath soon after the rupture), or in any novelty or enlargement of society.No one had ever come within the Kellynch circle, who could bear a comparison with Frederick Wentworth, as he stood in her memory.No second attachment, the only thoroughly natural, happy, and sufficient cure, at her time of life, had been possible to the nice tone of her mind, the fastidiousness of her taste, in the small limits of the society around them.She had been solicited, when about two-and-twenty, to change her name, by the young man, who not long afterwards found a more willing mind in her younger sister; and Lady Russell had lamented her refusal; for Charles Musgrove was the eldest son of a man, whose landed property and general importance were second in that country, only to Sir Walter’s, and of good character and appearance; and however Lady Russell might have asked yet for something more, while Anne was nineteen, she would have rejoiced to see her at twenty-two so respectably removed from the partialities and injustice of her father’s house, and settled so permanently near herself.But in this case, Anne had left nothing for advice to do; and though Lady Russell, as satisfied as ever with her own discretion, never wished the past undone, she began now to have the anxiety which borders on hopelessness for Anne’s being tempted, by some man of talents and independence, to enter a state for which she held her to be peculiarly fitted by her warm affections and domestic habits."
"拉塞尔夫人并不知道安妮怎样看待自己当时的行为，也不知道这种看法是否一贯如此或者有所改变，安妮也不知道拉塞尔夫人的想法，因为打那以后她们再也没有提起过这件事。但是安妮到了27岁，她的想法与19岁时在别人的影响下产生的想法就大不相同了。她没有责怪拉塞尔夫人，也没有责怪自己接受了拉塞尔夫人的劝告；但是她认为要是任何处境相同的人来征求她的意见，他们决不会接受这种必将立即引起不幸、对未来的幸福毫无保障的劝告。她现在相信，在遭到家人反对的不利情况下，尽管他们对弗雷德里克的职业感到忧虑，可能引起他们的忧虑、延误与失望，但是假使她保持婚约的话会比解除婚约更为幸福。而且，她完全相信，即使他们经受通常的、甚至超越常情的忧虑和不安，她也会感到更幸福些。更何况，事实表明，这桩婚姻本来可以比通常的期望更早地带来财富。弗雷德里克种种乐观的期待、自信心都被证明是有道理的。他的才能和激情似乎预见到并指引着他的成功之路。他在婚约解除后不久就接受了一项任命：他对安妮预言过的一切都实现了。他表现突出，很快就晋升了一级，加上战利品不断，现在肯定已经积累了大笔的财产。安妮仅以海军花名册与报纸为依据；但是她毫不怀疑他变得富有了。想到他用情专一，安妮没有理由认为他已经结婚。","They knew not each other’s opinion, either its constancy or its change, on the one leading point of Anne’s conduct, for the subject was never alluded to; but Anne, at seven-and-twenty, thought very differently from what she had been made to think at nineteen.She did not blame Lady Russell, she did not blame herself for having been guided by her; but she felt that were any young person, in similar circumstances, to apply to her for counsel, they would never receive any of such certain immediate wretchedness, such uncertain future good.She was persuaded that under every disadvantage of disapprobation at home, and every anxiety attending his profession, all their probable fears, delays, and disappointments, she should yet have been a happier woman in maintaining the engagement, than she had been in the sacrifice of it; and this, she fully believed, had the usual share, had even more than the usual share of all such solicitudes and suspense been theirs, without reference to the actual results of their case, which, as it happened, would have bestowed earlier prosperity than could be reasonably calculated on.All his sanguine expectations, all his confidence had been justified.His genius and ardour had seemed to foresee and to command his prosperous path.He had, very soon after their engagement ceased, got employ: and all that he had told her would follow, had taken place.He had distinguished himself, and early gained the other step in rank, and must now, by successive captures, have made a handsome fortune.She had only navy lists and newspapers for her authority, but she could not doubt his being rich; and, in favour of his constancy, she had no reason to believe him married."
"若叫安妮•埃利奥特说起来，那该具有何等的说服力啊！至少她对早年热恋的渴望，对未来的满怀信心，是多么具有说服力啊，而过分的谨慎看起来是对努力的亵渎与对上帝的怀疑啊！她年轻的时候不得不谨小慎微，随着年龄的增长才懂得了什么是浪漫：这是畸形的开端造成的必然后果。","How eloquent could Anne Elliot have been!how eloquent, at least, were her wishes on the side of early warm attachment, and a cheerful confidence in futurity, against that over-anxious caution which seems to insult exertion and distrust Providence!She had been forced into prudence in her youth, she learned romance as she grew older: the natural sequel of an unnatural beginning."
"在这所有情况、回忆与感情的影响下，安妮在听到温特沃思海军上校的姐姐要住进凯林奇府时，不由得勾起过去的痛苦回忆。为驱散这一不安的念头，她需要多少次漫步、多少次叹息啊。她一再告诫自己这样做很愚蠢，最后她才鼓足勇气，觉得家人喋喋不休地谈论克罗夫特夫妇要租房子的事情没有什么恶意。不过她的亲朋好友中知道过去这段隐情的只有三个人，而他们对此毫不在乎，摆出一副毫无所知的样子，似乎根本不记得有过这件事情，这倒给安妮帮了忙。她可以公平地断定，拉塞尔夫人的动机比父亲和伊丽莎白高尚得多。她尊重拉塞尔夫人保持沉默的善意，但是不管是出于什么考虑，重要的是，大家似乎都忘记了过去。当克罗夫特将军真要租下凯林奇府时，安妮又一次高兴地确信过去一直使她大感宽慰的一点：在她的亲朋好友中知道往事的仅有三人，而这些人决不会有任何泄露，而且她认为，在弗雷德里克的亲朋好友中，只有当时和他住在一起的哥哥知道他们之间那段短暂的姻缘。这位哥哥早就搬离了这里，他为人又通情达理，而且当时还是个单身汉，所以安妮深信，没有人会从他那里听到这段隐情的。","With all these circumstances, recollections and feelings, she could not hear that Captain Wentworth’s sister was likely to live at Kellynch without a revival of former pain; and many a stroll, and many a sigh, were necessary to dispel the agitation of the idea.She often told herself it was folly, before she could harden her nerves sufficiently to feel the continual discussion of the Crofts and their business no evil.She was assisted, however, by that perfect indifference and apparent unconsciousness, among the only three of her own friends in the secret of the past, which seemed almost to deny any recollection of it.She could do justice to the superiority of Lady Russell’s motives in this, over those of her father and Elizabeth; she could honour all the better feelings of her calmness; but the general air of oblivion among them was highly important from whatever it sprung; and in the event of Admiral Croft’s really taking Kellynch Hall, she rejoiced anew over the conviction which had always been most grateful to her, of the past being known to those three only among her connexions, by whom no syllable, she believed, would ever be whispered, and in the trust that among his, the brother only with whom he had been residing, had received any information of their short-lived engagement.That brother had been long removed from the country and being a sensible man, and, moreover, a single man at the time, she had a fond dependence on no human creature’s having heard of it from him."
"温特沃思的姐姐克罗夫特太太当时不在英国，陪同丈夫到海外基地驻扎了。在发生这一切时，安妮的妹妹玛丽正在学校，人们也许出于自尊，或许出于体贴，后来一丝半点儿也没有告诉她。","The sister, Mrs. Croft, had then been out of England, accompanying her husband on a foreign station, and her own sister, Mary, had been at school while it all occurred; and never admitted by the pride of some, and the delicacy of others, to the smallest knowledge of it afterwards."
"在这一切想法的支持下，安妮希望她同克罗夫特夫妇的结识不会出现任何特别尴尬的场面。而由于拉塞尔夫人还住在凯林奇，玛丽在三里之外，她对这一结识必须有所期待。","With these supports, she hoped that the acquaintance between herself and the Crofts, which, with Lady Russell, still resident in Kellynch, and Mary fixed only three miles off, must be anticipated, need not involve any particular awkwardness."
"第五章","CHAPTER 5"
"在克罗夫特将军夫妇约定来看房子的那天上午，安妮自然到拉塞尔夫人家里去了，她本来就几乎天天去拉塞尔夫人家走一趟。她在那里一直躲到一切都结束才回家。后来，她却为失去与克罗夫特夫妇见面的机会，又自然而然地感到遗憾。","On the morning appointed for Admiral and Mrs. Croft’s seeing Kellynch Hall, Anne found it most natural to take her almost daily walk to Lady Russell’s, and keep out of the way till all was over; when she found it most natural to be sorry that she had missed the opportunity of seeing them."
"双方的这次会见令人非常满意，他们当场就把事情谈妥了。两位女士原本就非常愿意达成协议，因此就只看得见对方优雅的风度；至于两位绅士嘛，将军那样兴高采烈又大方慷慨，对房主表现出充分的信任，这不能不使沃尔特爵士受到感染。此外，谢泼德先生本来就告诉过爵士，这位将军早就听说他堪称卓有教养的楷模，在这一奉承下，爵士的言谈举止自然极其得体，极其优雅。","This meeting of the two parties proved highly satisfactory, and decided the whole business at once.Each lady was previously well disposed for an agreement, and saw nothing, therefore, but good manners in the other; and with regard to the gentlemen, there was such an hearty good humour, such an open, trusting liberality on the Admiral’s side, as could not but influence Sir Walter, who had besides been flattered into his very best and most polished behaviour by Mr. Shepherd’s assurances of his being known, by report, to the Admiral, as a model of good breeding."
"房子、庭园与家具都得到了认可，克罗夫特夫妇也得到了认可。条件、时间、各项安排、有关人员都没有问题。谢泼德先生的办事员便着手工作。从一开始，双方都没有对“合同规定”的各个项目提出任何异议，不需要对其进行任何修改。","The house and grounds, and furniture, were approved, the Crofts were approved, terms, time, every thing, and every body, was right; and Mr. Shepherd’s clerks were set to work, without there having been a single preliminary difference to modify of all that “This indenture sheweth.”"
"沃尔特爵士毫不犹豫地宣布克罗夫特将军是他遇到过的最神气的海军将领，他甚至说，如果让他的仆人为之理发，他便可以毫无愧色地同克罗夫特将军一起在任何地方露面。回去时，将军在马车驶过花园时，真挚而热情地对妻子说：“亲爱的，尽管在汤顿有人跟我们说了他们很多闲话，但我想我们会很快谈成此事的。准男爵不会有什么惊人之举，但为人也不坏。”这种相互的恭维可以说是旗鼓相当的。","Sir Walter, without hesitation, declared the Admiral to be the best-looking sailor he had ever met with, and went so far as to say, that if his own man might have had the arranging of his hair, he should not be ashamed of being seen with him any where; and the Admiral, with sympathetic cordiality, observed to his wife as they drove back through the park, “I thought we should soon come to a deal, my dear, in spite of what they told us at Taunton.The Baronet will never set the Thames on fire, but there seems to be no harm in him.” reciprocal compliments, which would have been esteemed about equal."
"克罗夫特夫妇要在米迦勒节那天住进凯林奇府，沃尔特爵士提议早一个月迁往巴斯，因此要抓紧时间进行搬家的各种安排。","The Crofts were to have possession at Michaelmas; and as Sir Walter proposed removing to Bath in the course of the preceding month, there was no time to be lost in making every dependent arrangement."
"拉塞尔夫人深信，在爵士家选择新居的问题上，安妮不会有什么发言权，也起不了什么作用，所以不愿意让安妮走得太早，希望她留下来，等到圣诞节过后亲自把她送到巴斯。但是拉塞尔夫人自己又有事，必须离开凯林奇几个星期，但又不可能尽心如愿地提出邀请，而安妮呢，虽然惧怕巴斯九月份的炎炎烈日，又很留恋乡间温馨而萧瑟的秋景，但是通盘考虑了一下，她还是不想留下。同大家一起走是上策，这样做最聪明，痛苦也最少。","Lady Russell, convinced that Anne would not be allowed to be of any use, or any importance, in the choice of the house which they were going to secure, was very unwilling to have her hurried away so soon, and wanted to make it possible for her to stay behind till she might convey her to Bath herself after Christmas; but having engagements of her own which must take her from Kellynch for several weeks, she was unable to give the full invitation she wished, and Anne though dreading the possible heats of September in all the white glare of Bath, and grieving to forego all the influence so sweet and so sad of the autumnal months in the country, did not think that, everything considered, she wished to remain.It would be most right, and most wise, and, therefore must involve least suffering to go with the others."
"不过这时出了些状况，安妮又得担负起另一种责任。玛丽，经常有点小恙，而且总是把自己的病情看得很严重，而且一有点什么就要把安妮叫去。那天，玛丽感到有点不舒服，她预感到自己整个秋天都好不了了，所以就请求，或者更确切地说，是要求安妮不要到巴斯去，而是到阿珀克罗斯乡舍去同做伴，而且要她呆多久就呆多久，这就很难说是请求了。","Something occurred, however, to give her a different duty.Mary, often a little unwell, and always thinking a great deal of her own complaints, and always in the habit of claiming Anne when anything was the matter, was indisposed; and foreseeing that she should not have a day’s health all the autumn, entreated, or rather required her, for it was hardly entreaty, to come to Uppercross Cottage, and bear her company as long as she should want her, instead of going to Bath."
"“我不能没有安妮。”这是玛丽的理由。伊丽莎白的回答则是：“那么，我觉得安妮最好还是留下，因为巴斯那边谁也不需要她。”","“I cannot possibly do without Anne,” was Mary’s reasoning; and Elizabeth’s reply was, “Then I am sure Anne had better stay, for nobody will want her in Bath.”"
"虽说提法不大合适，但被认为有用总比被人当作无用之材而舍弃的好。安妮很高兴被人看作还有点作用，很乐意承担别人给她分派的任务，何况要她尽义务的地方是在乡间，在她亲爱的家乡，所以她欣然同意留下。","To be claimed as a good, though in an improper style, is at least better than being rejected as no good at all; and Anne, glad to be thought of some use, glad to have anything marked out as a duty, and certainly not sorry to have the scene of it in the country, and her own dear country, readily agreed to stay."
"玛丽的这一邀请解决了拉塞尔夫人的全部困难，事情很快就决定了：安妮暂时不去巴斯，等以后拉塞尔夫人把她送去。在这期间，她将轮流住在阿珀克罗斯乡舍和凯林奇小屋。","This invitation of Mary’s removed all Lady Russell’s difficulties, and it was consequently soon settled that Anne should not go to Bath till Lady Russell took her, and that all the intervening time should be divided between Uppercross Cottage and Kellynch Lodge."
"至此，一切都已安排妥当。但是拉塞尔夫人突然得知，凯林奇府的计划是要克莱太太同沃尔特爵士和伊丽莎白一起去巴斯，因为伊丽莎白在处理各项事务时很需要这位可贵的重要帮手。这一项不恰当的安排几乎使拉塞尔夫人吓了一跳。拉塞尔夫人感到极其遗憾，沃尔特爵士父女居然会采取这样的措施，这真叫她感到惊讶、伤心和害怕。他们这么看重克莱太太，却把安妮看成一无是处，这是对安妮的侮辱，确实令人十分恼怒。","So far all was perfectly right; but Lady Russell was almost startled by the wrong of one part of the Kellynch Hall plan, when it burst on her, which was, Mrs. Clay’s being engaged to go to Bath with Sir Walter and Elizabeth, as a most important and valuable assistant to the latter in all the business before her.Lady Russell was extremely sorry that such a measure should have been resorted to at all, wondered, grieved, and feared; and the affront it contained to Anne, in Mrs. Clay’s being of so much use, while Anne could be of none, was a very sore aggravation."
"安妮本人对这种侮辱却无动于衷了，不过他跟拉塞尔夫人一样，也敏锐地感到这种安排是草率的。凭着她大量的暗中观察以及对父亲的了解，虽然她常常希望自己对父亲的了解不要这么透彻，但她感觉到了她父亲同克莱太太的亲密关系完全可能给他一家带来非常严重的后果。她并不认为她父亲现在就有这种想法。克莱太太满脸雀斑，长着龅牙，还有一双沃尔特爵士常在背地里加以挖苦的笨拙手腕。不过克莱太太正年轻，总的来说肯定还算漂亮，而且思维敏捷，举止一向讨人喜欢，所以其吸引力比任何徒有其表的人危险得多。安妮深感事态的严重，觉得必须让姐姐有所察觉。她成功的希望很渺茫，但一旦出了事，伊丽莎白就没有理由责备安妮，说她事先没有提出警告。安妮觉得，要是真的出了事，伊丽莎白比她更可怜。","Anne herself was become hardened to such affronts; but she felt the imprudence of the arrangement quite as keenly as Lady Russell.With a great deal of quiet observation, and a knowledge, which she often wished less, of her father’s character, she was sensible that results the most serious to his family from the intimacy were more than possible.She did not imagine that her father had at present an idea of the kind.Mrs. Clay had freckles, and a projecting tooth, and a clumsy wrist, which he was continually making severe remarks upon, in her absence; but she was young, and certainly altogether well-looking, and possessed, in an acute mind and assiduous pleasing manners, infinitely more dangerous attractions than any merely personal might have been.Anne was so impressed by the degree of their danger, that she could not excuse herself from trying to make it perceptible to her sister.She had little hope of success; but Elizabeth, who in the event of such a reverse would be so much more to be pitied than herself, should never, she thought, have reason to reproach her for giving no warning."
"安妮说了自己的想法，但是看来却冒犯了姐姐。伊莉莎白无法理解安妮怎么会产生如此荒唐的怀疑，生气地保证父亲和克莱太太都很清楚各自的身份。","She spoke, and seemed only to offend.Elizabeth could not conceive how such an absurd suspicion should occur to her, and indignantly answered for each party’s perfectly knowing their situation."
"“克莱太太，”她激动地说，“从来没有忘记自己的身份，我比你更了解她的想法，我可以保证，她对婚姻问题的看法非常正确，她比大多数人更强烈地谴责门不当、户不对的婚姻。至于父亲，这些年来他为了我们一直过着独身的生活，我的确想象不到现在居然要去怀疑他。假如克莱太太是一位非常漂亮的女人，我承认我总跟她在一起或许不大恰当。我确信，这倒不是因为世上有什么事会促使父亲去结一门丢人的婚姻，而是因为他会感到不快。但是可怜的克莱太太，尽管自己有很多优点，却绝对算不上有姿色，我确实认为可怜的克莱太太住在这里是万无一失的。别人还会以为你从没听见父亲议论过她外貌上的缺陷呢，可是我知道，你大概听过不下五十次了。她的那颗牙齿，她的雀斑。我还不像父亲那样讨厌雀斑呢。我认识一位脸上有几个雀斑，但却不难看的人，可是父亲却非常讨厌那些雀斑。你一定听过他议论克莱太太的雀斑吧。”","“Mrs. Clay,” said she, warmly, “never forgets who she is; and as I am rather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can be, I can assure you, that upon the subject of marriage they are particularly nice, and that she reprobates all inequality of condition and rank more strongly than most people.And as to my father, I really should not have thought that he, who has kept himself single so long for our sakes, need be suspected now.If Mrs. Clay were a very beautiful woman, I grant you, it might be wrong to have her so much with me; not that anything in the world, I am sure, would induce my father to make a degrading match, but he might be rendered unhappy.But poor Mrs. Clay who, with all her merits, can never have been reckoned tolerably pretty, I really think poor Mrs. Clay may be staying here in perfect safety.One would imagine you had never heard my father speak of her personal misfortunes, though I know you must fifty times.That tooth of her’s and those freckles.Freckles do not disgust me so very much as they do him.I have known a face not materially disfigured by a few, but he abominates them.You must have heard him notice Mrs. Clay’s freckles.”"
"“一个人不管相貌上有什么缺陷，”安妮回答道，“只要态度讨人喜欢，总会使对方渐渐产生好感的。”","“There is hardly any personal defect,” replied Anne, “which an agreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one to.”"
"“我不这么认为，”伊丽莎白立即回答道，“态度讨人喜欢可以衬托出美丽的外貌，但是改变不了丑陋的外貌。不过，不管怎么说，在这方面我承担的风险比任何人都大，我觉得，你没有必要对我提出任何劝告。”","“I think very differently,” answered Elizabeth, shortly; “an agreeable manner may set off handsome features, but can never alter plain ones.However, at any rate, as I have a great deal more at stake on this point than anybody else can have, I think it rather unnecessary in you to be advising me.”"
"安妮说出了想法，也很高兴结束这番对话，她对这次谈话的作用多少抱有一线希望。伊丽莎白虽然对安妮的怀疑抱有反感，但这也许能加强她的戒备心理。","Anne had done; glad that it was over, and not absolutely hopeless of doing good.Elizabeth, though resenting the suspicion, might yet be made observant by it."
"那辆驷马马车的最后任务是将沃尔特爵士、埃利奥特小姐和克莱太太送到巴斯去。这帮人兴高采烈地出发了。沃尔特准备好要屈尊给那些得到暗示而出来送行的寒酸佃农和村民鞠躬致意。而在这时，安妮却正平静而凄凉地朝拉塞尔夫人的小屋走去，她要在那里度过她的第一个星期。","The last office of the four carriage-horses was to draw Sir Walter, Miss Elliot, and Mrs. Clay to Bath.The party drove off in very good spirits; Sir Walter prepared with condescending bows for all the afflicted tenantry and cottagers who might have had a hint to show themselves, and Anne walked up at the same time, in a sort of desolate tranquillity, to the Lodge, where she was to spend the first week."
"她朋友的情绪并不比她的高。拉塞尔夫人对这个家庭的败落感到十分感伤。沃尔特爵士一家的体面跟她自己的一样珍贵，他们之间的日常交往已经成了一种宝贵的习惯。看到被他们荒废的庭园，她就感到很痛心，而且一想到这些房产将落入他人之手，就更加难过。为避免目睹村子在经历如此巨变后产生的寂寞和忧郁，为免得看到克罗夫特将军夫妇搬来的情景，她早就决定在安妮必须离去的那天一同出门。因此她们两人一起出发了，安妮陪拉塞尔夫人走了头一程，便来到了阿珀克罗斯乡舍。","Her friend was not in better spirits than herself.Lady Russell felt this break-up of the family exceedingly.Their respectability was as dear to her as her own, and a daily intercourse had become precious by habit.It was painful to look upon their deserted grounds, and still worse to anticipate the new hands they were to fall into; and to escape the solitariness and the melancholy of so altered a village, and be out of the way when Admiral and Mrs. Croft first arrived, she had determined to make her own absence from home begin when she must give up Anne.Accordingly their removal was made together, and Anne was set down at Uppercross Cottage, in the first stage of Lady Russell’s journey."
"阿珀克罗斯是一个中等大小的村庄，就在几年以前，这里还完全是一派英国古老风格，当时只有这两座房子看上去比自耕农与佃农的房子好一些。属于乡绅的一座庄园有着高高的围墙、宽大的院门、古老的树林，房屋坚固而古朴。另一座是紧凑而整洁的牧师住宅，四周是个雅致的私人花园，窗框周围满是葡萄藤和梨树枝。但是，乡绅在儿子结婚时，为他把一座农舍修缮成一幢住宅，从而改变了村子的面貌。这座阿珀克罗斯乡舍建有游廊、法国式窗户，还有其他装饰，和约在半公里以外的那座造型更为协调、庭园更为宽敞的老宅一样能够吸引过路人的注目。","Uppercross was a moderate-sized village, which a few years back had been completely in the old English style, containing only two houses superior in appearance to those of the yeomen and labourers; the mansion of the squire, with its high walls, great gates, and old trees, substantial and unmodernized, and the compact, tight parsonage, enclosed in its own neat garden, with a vine and a pear-tree trained round its casements; but upon the marriage of the young ‘squire, it had received the improvement of a farm-house elevated into a cottage, for his residence, and Uppercross Cottage, with its veranda, French windows, and other prettiness, was quite as likely to catch the traveller’s eye as the more consistent and considerable aspect and premises of the Great House, about a quarter of a mile farther on."
"安妮常来这里小住。她对阿珀克罗斯的生活方式非常熟悉，就像熟悉凯林奇的一样。他们两家人如此频繁地往来，养成了随时在对方家里跑进跑出的习惯。因此，安妮看到玛丽一人在家，感到非常惊讶。不过，玛丽既然是单独一个人，那么身体不适和情绪沮丧是肯定无疑的了。尽管玛丽的条件比安妮好，但是她却没有姐姐的悟性和脾气。她在身体健康、心情舒畅、受到别人妥当照顾的时候，是很幽默而活泼的。但是只要有一点小毛病，她的情绪就会一落千丈。她最怕孤独，而且在很大程度上继承了埃利奥特家族自负的传统，不管遇到什么不快，总是疑心遭到了忽视和屈辱。从容貌上看，玛丽较两位姐姐逊色，甚至在她豆蔻年华之际，也只能算个“还看得过去的姑娘”。这时，她正躺在漂亮的小客厅里一张褪色的沙发上。这些当年十分典雅的陈设，经过四个春秋和两个孩子的折腾，已经逐渐破旧了。一看到安妮到来，玛丽劈面就是一句：","Here Anne had often been staying.She knew the ways of Uppercross as well as those of Kellynch.The two families were so continually meeting, so much in the habit of running in and out of each other’s house at all hours, that it was rather a surprise to her to find Mary alone; but being alone, her being unwell and out of spirits was almost a matter of course.Though better endowed than the elder sister, Mary had not Anne’s understanding nor temper.While well, and happy, and properly attended to, she had great good humour and excellent spirits; but any indisposition sunk her completely.She had no resources for solitude; and inheriting a considerable share of the Elliot self-importance, was very prone to add to every other distress that of fancying herself neglected and ill-used.In person, she was inferior to both sisters, and had, even in her bloom, only reached the dignity of being “a fine girl.” She was now lying on the faded sofa of the pretty little drawing-room, the once elegant furniture of which had been gradually growing shabby, under the influence of four summers and two children; and, on Anne’s appearing, greeted her with—"
"“啊，你总算来了！我还以为永远都见不到你了。我很不舒服，连说话的力气都没有。一上午都没见到一个人影！”","“So, you are come at last!I began to think I should never see you.I am so ill I can hardly speak.I have not seen a creature the whole morning!”"
"“看到你身体这么不好，我很难过，”安妮回答说，“你星期四给我的信中，不是说你一切都很好吗！”","“I am sorry to find you unwell,” replied Anne.“You sent me such a good account of yourself on Thursday!”"
"“是的，我不过往好处说而已。我一向是这样。其实那天我感到很不舒服。今天上午，我好像一辈子也没有这么难受过，真不该让我一个人呆在家里。我万一突然病得不行，不能打铃，怎么办呢？这么说，拉塞尔夫人是不肯下车了。我想今年夏天她到这儿来还不超过三次呢。”","“Yes, I made the best of it; I always do: but I was very far from well at the time; and I do not think I ever was so ill in my life as I have been all this morning: very unfit to be left alone, I am sure.Suppose I were to be seized of a sudden in some dreadful way, and not able to ring the bell!So, Lady Russell would not get out.I do not think she has been in this house three times this summer.”"
"安妮说了些应景的话，接着又问了问玛丽的丈夫。“啊，查尔斯打猎去了。我从七点钟起就没有见过他。尽管我对他说我很不舒服，但他还是去了。他说他不会在外面呆太久，可是他根本没回来，现在都已经快一点了。我跟你说，整整一上午，我一个人也没有见到。”","Anne said what was proper, and enquired after her husband.“Oh! Charles is out shooting.I have not seen him since seven o’clock.He would go, though I told him how ill I was.He said he should not stay out long; but he has never come back, and now it is almost one.I assure you, I have not seen a soul this whole long morning.”"
"“你没有叫两个儿子来陪你一会儿吗？”","“You have had your little boys with you?”"
"“他们来了，我又受不了他们的吵闹，可是他们根本不听管教。他们对我只有坏处没有好处。小查尔斯一句话也不听我的，沃尔特也变得一样淘气。”","“Yes, as long as I could bear their noise; but they are so unmanageable that they do me more harm than good.Little Charles does not mind a word I say, and Walter is growing quite as bad.”"
"“好了，你一会儿就会好的，”安妮兴致勃勃地回答说，“你知道，我一来就总会把你的病治好。你老宅里的邻居怎么样了？”","“Well, you will soon be better now,” replied Anne, cheerfully.“You know I always cure you when I come.How are your neighbours at the Great House?”"
"“我没法向你介绍他们的情况。今天，我谁也没有看见，只有马斯格罗夫先生在窗口停下来跟我说了几句，他当时连马都没有下。尽管我告诉他我病得很厉害，可是他们谁也没靠近我。我想，大概是两位马斯格罗夫小姐觉得不方便吧，她们从来都不肯为别人费心的。”","“I can give you no account of them.I have not seen one of them today, except Mr. Musgrove, who just stopped and spoke through the window, but without getting off his horse; and though I told him how ill I was, not one of them have been near me.It did not happen to suit the Miss Musgroves, I suppose, and they never put themselves out of their way.”"
"“也许不等上午结束，你就会见到她们的。时间还早。”","“You will see them yet, perhaps, before the morning is gone. It is early.” "
"“我告诉你，我才不需要她们呢。她们太爱说笑了，这让我受不了。啊，安妮，我真是身体不舒服！你星期四没来，真是不体谅人。”","“I never want them, I assure you.They talk and laugh a great deal too much for me.Oh! Anne, I am so very unwell!It was quite unkind of you not to come on Thursday.”"
"“亲爱的玛丽，你想想，你在寄给我的信里把自己写得多么舒适啊！”你用最愉快的笔调，告诉我你身体非常好，不急于让我来。既然如此，你一定知道我想同拉塞尔夫人呆到最后。而且除了要照顾她以外，我确实一直很忙，有好多事情要干，因此很不方便，不能早点离开凯林奇。”","“My dear Mary, recollect what a comfortable account you sent me of yourself!You wrote in the cheerfullest manner, and said you were perfectly well, and in no hurry for me; and that being the case, you must be aware that my wish would be to remain with Lady Russell to the last: and besides what I felt on her account, I have really been so busy, have had so much to do, that I could not very conveniently have left Kellynch sooner.”"
"“是吗！可是你能干些什么呢？”","“Dear me!what can you possibly have to do?”"
"“告诉你，事情多着呢。多得我一下子也记不起来，不过我可以大致告诉你一些。我一直在为父亲的书画誊写目录。我同麦肯齐去花园转了几次，想要弄清楚，也让麦肯齐弄清楚，伊丽莎白的花草中哪些是送给拉塞尔夫人的。我自己也还有一些小事要安排，书籍和乐谱要分门别类地分清楚，我的箱子需要重新收拾，因为我没有及时地搞清楚货车方面的时间安排。玛丽，我还有一件更尴尬的事情：就是要到教区里的每一家走一趟，算是告别。据说他们希望我能告别一下。不过这些事情占据了我好多时间。”","“A great many things, I assure you.More than I can recollect in a moment; but I can tell you some.I have been making a duplicate of the catalogue of my father’s books and pictures.I have been several times in the garden with Mackenzie, trying to understand, and make him understand, which of Elizabeth’s plants are for Lady Russell.I have had all my own little concerns to arrange, books and music to divide, and all my trunks to repack, from not having understood in time what was intended as to the waggons: and one thing I have had to do, Mary, of a more trying nature: going to almost every house in the parish, as a sort of take-leave.I was told that they wished it.But all these things took up a great deal of time.”"
"“啊，好吧！”玛丽顿了一会儿，又接着说道，“但是你一句也没有问起昨天我们在普尔家吃晚餐的事情。”","“Oh!well!” and after a moment’s pause, “but you have never asked me one word about our dinner at the Pooles yesterday.”"
"“这么说，你还是去了？”我没问起，是因为我以为你准是不得已放弃了这次宴会。”","“Did you go then?I have made no enquiries, because I concluded you must have been obliged to give up the party.”"
"“啊，是的！我去了。昨天我身体很好，直到今天早上我一直都很好。我要是不去，那不是很奇怪。”","“Oh yes!I went.I was very well yesterday; nothing at all the matter with me till this morning.It would have been strange if I had not gone.”"
"“我很高兴你当时身体很好，我想你们的宴会应该很有趣吧。”","“I am very glad you were well enough, and I hope you had a pleasant party.”"
"“没什么特别的。你总是预先知道晚餐会吃些什么东西，有哪些人参加。不过没有自己的马车，真令人不舒服。马斯格罗夫夫妇带我去的，车上太挤了！他们俩那么胖，占去那么多的地方，而且马斯格罗夫先生总是坐在最前面。这样一来，我就同亨里埃塔和路易莎一起挤在后座。我想我今天不舒服很可能是被挤导致的。”","“Nothing remarkable.One always knows beforehand what the dinner will be, and who will be there; and it is so very uncomfortable not having a carriage of one’s own.Mr. and Mrs. Musgrove took me, and we were so crowded!They are both so very large, and take up so much room; and Mr. Musgrove always sits forward.So, there was I, crowded into the back seat with Henrietta and Louisa; and I think it very likely that my illness to-day may be owing to it.”"
"安妮继续耐着性子，勉强微笑着，几乎真把玛丽的病给治好了。玛丽很快就能在沙发上直身坐起来了，并且自己希望吃晚饭的时候就能离开沙发了。一会儿，她竟然忘了此事，走到房间的另一头整理花束了，接着她又吃了一点冻肉，又跟没事似的，还建议出去散散步。","A little further perseverance in patience and forced cheerfulness on Anne’s side produced nearly a cure on Mary’s.She could soon sit upright on the sofa, and began to hope she might be able to leave it by dinner-time.Then, forgetting to think of it, she was at the other end of the room, beautifying a nosegay; then, she ate her cold meat; and then she was well enough to propose a little walk."
"两人准备停当以后，她又说：“到哪儿去呢？”“我想，在老宅的人来看你以前，你是不想去拜访他们的吧？”","“Where shall we go?” said she, when they were ready.“I suppose you will not like to call at the Great House before they have been to see you?”"
"“我丝毫没有什么不愿意的，”安妮回答说。“对于马斯格罗夫太太和小姐那样熟悉的人，我决不会这么拘礼的。”","“I have not the smallest objection on that account,” replied Anne.“I should never think of standing on such ceremony with people I know so well as Mrs. and the Miss Musgroves.”"
"“哼，他们倒是应该尽快来看看你。他们应该知道如何对待你，因为你是我的姐姐。不过，我们还是去他们那里坐一会儿吧，然后就可以安心地去散步了。”","“Oh!but they ought to call upon you as soon as possible.They ought to feel what is due to you as my sister.However, we may as well go and sit with them a little while, and when we have that over, we can enjoy our walk.”"
"安妮一直以为这种交往方式极不谨慎，但是她又不想加以阻止，因为她觉得尽管双方不断有使人不快之举，但是总免不了你来我往的。因此，他们去了老宅，在那旧式的方形客厅中坐了足足半个小时，客厅的地板非常光亮，地上铺着一块小地毯。当时，房主的两个女儿已陆续在里面摆放了一家钢琴、一架竖琴，又到处放了花架与小桌子，把屋子弄得乱七八糟。哎，要是护壁板上的那些真迹画像，那些身穿棕色丝绒服的绅士和身穿蓝色缎子的太太看到这番景象，看到这里给弄得乱七八糟，觉察到如此的脏乱，会有何感想呢？这些画像似乎也在惊讶地凝视着这一切。","Anne had always thought such a style of intercourse highly imprudent; but she had ceased to endeavour to check it, from believing that, though there were on each side continual subjects of offence, neither family could now do without it.To the Great House accordingly they went, to sit the full half hour in the old-fashioned square parlour, with a small carpet and shining floor, to which the present daughters of the house were gradually giving the proper air of confusion by a grand piano-forte and a harp, flower-stands and little tables placed in every direction.Oh! could the originals of the portraits against the wainscot, could the gentlemen in brown velvet and the ladies in blue satin have seen what was going on, have been conscious of such an overthrow of all order and neatness!The portraits themselves seemed to be staring in astonishment."
"马斯格罗夫一家，同他们的房子一样，正在经历着变迁，也许是向好的方向变化。父母保持传统的英国人习惯，而年轻人则都是新派。马斯格罗夫夫妇都是大好人：为人友好、热情好客。他们没有受过多少教育，谈不上什么高雅。孩子们的思想举止却很时髦。原来这户人家子女很多，但是除了查尔斯之外，只有两个长大成人了：亨里埃塔和路易莎。这两位小姐，一个十九岁，一个二十岁，在埃克塞特的学校读书时学到了她们该学的东西。现在她们同许多其他的年轻小姐一样，过着时髦、幸福而愉快的生活。她们衣着漂亮、容颜秀丽，情绪高涨，举止大方可爱。她们是家里的宠儿，在外面也颇受青睐。安妮总是把她们看成是最幸福的几位朋友，但是我们大家都有某种足以自慰的优越感，不愿同别人换个位置。安妮也一样，她不愿放弃自己更高雅和更有教养的心胸，去换取这两位朋友的一切享受。她只是羡慕这两位姐妹之间看上去极为和谐而默契、开朗而友好的感情，安妮同自己的姐妹之间却缺少这样的感情。","The Musgroves, like their houses, were in a state of alteration, perhaps of improvement.The father and mother were in the old English style, and the young people in the new.Mr. and Mrs. Musgrove were a very good sort of people; friendly and hospitable, not much educated, and not at all elegant.Their children had more modern minds and manners.There was a numerous family; but the only two grown up, excepting Charles, were Henrietta and Louisa, young ladies of nineteen and twenty, who had brought from school at Exeter all the usual stock of accomplishments, and were now like thousands of other young ladies, living to be fashionable, happy, and merry.Their dress had every advantage, their faces were rather pretty, their spirits extremely good, their manner unembarrassed and pleasant; they were of consequence at home, and favourites abroad.Anne always contemplated them as some of the happiest creatures of her acquaintance; but still, saved as we all are, by some comfortable feeling of superiority from wishing for the possibility of exchange, she would not have given up her own more elegant and cultivated mind for all their enjoyments; and envied them nothing but that seemingly perfect good understanding and agreement together, that good-humoured mutual affection, of which she had known so little herself with either of her sisters."
"安妮和玛丽受到了热情的款待。老宅一家人对她们招待非常周到，安妮心里清楚，这一方通常是无可厚非的。他们愉快地交谈着，半个小时一晃就过去了。谈话结束时，两位马斯格罗夫小姐在玛丽的盛情邀请下，同他们一起散步去了。对此，安妮一点也不感到奇怪。","They were received with great cordiality.Nothing seemed amiss on the side of the Great House family, which was generally, as Anne very well knew, the least to blame.The half hour was chatted away pleasantly enough; and she was not at all surprised at the end of it, to have their walking party joined by both the Miss Musgroves, at Mary’s particular invitation."
"第六章","CHAPTER 6"
"安妮并不需要通过这次对阿珀克罗斯的拜访来体会：人们离开一群人，来到另一群人中间，即使两者相距只有三英里，人们的谈话、见解和思维往往根本不同。以前，每次来到这里，她都对此感触颇深。她希望埃利奥特家的其他成员能像她一样有幸看到：凯林奇府认为是众所周知和饶有兴味的事情，在这里却根本无人知晓或显得无足轻重。然而，尽管有过这些体验，安妮仍然觉得，现在她应该意识到有必要接受另一个教训，即甘心承认人们脱离了自己的环境便毫无价值。安妮来到这里时，脑子里装满了几星期来凯林奇两家人一心为之操劳的事情。她当然以为会遇到一些好奇和同情，而不仅仅是马斯格罗夫先生和太太分别作出但极其相似的表态：“这么说，安妮小姐，沃尔特爵士和你姐姐已经走了。你认为他们会在巴斯的哪个地方定居？”说完后，也不怎么想听安妮的回答；也不仅仅是两位小姐的插话：“我希望冬天我们也能到巴斯去。不过，爸爸，请记住，我们如果去的话，居住条件一定要好。我们可不愿意住女王广场！”也不仅仅是玛丽不快的补充：“是啊，等你们大家都到巴斯去享乐时，我可就要倒霉了！”","Anne had not wanted this visit to Uppercross, to learn that a removal from one set of people to another, though at a distance of only three miles, will often include a total change of conversation, opinion, and idea.She had never been staying there before, without being struck by it, or without wishing that other Elliots could have her advantage in seeing how unknown, or unconsidered there, were the affairs which at Kellynch Hall were treated as of such general publicity and pervading interest; yet, with all this experience, she believed she must now submit to feel that another lesson, in the art of knowing our own nothingness beyond our own circle, was become necessary for her; for certainly, coming as she did, with a heart full of the subject which had been completely occupying both houses in Kellynch for many weeks, she had expected rather more curiosity and sympathy than she found in the separate but very similar remark of Mr. and Mrs. Musgrove: “So, Miss Anne, Sir Walter and your sister are gone; and what part of Bath do you think they will settle in?” and this, without much waiting for an answer; or in the young ladies’ addition of, “I hope we shall be in Bath in the winter; but remember, papa, if we do go, we must"
"安妮只能下定决心今后避免这自欺欺人的念头，同时也更加庆幸自己有福气拥有拉塞尔夫人这样真正富有同情心的朋友。","She could only resolve to avoid such self-delusion in future, and think with heightened gratitude of the extraordinary blessing of having one such truly sympathising friend as Lady Russell."
"马斯格罗夫父子俩要护猎、狩猎、养马、养狗和看报；太太和小姐们整天忙于种种家务、邻居交往、穿着打扮、唱歌和跳舞。安妮承认，每个小小的社交圈子应该有与之相宜的话题，并希望不久以后能当之无愧地成为目前所处的社交圈子中的一员。安妮预期要在阿珀克罗斯至少呆两个月，因而必须使自己的幻想、记忆和种种想法沉浸尽可能地不脱离这个地方。","The Mr. Musgroves had their own game to guard, and to destroy, their own horses, dogs, and newspapers to engage them, and the females were fully occupied in all the other common subjects of housekeeping, neighbours, dress, dancing, and music.She acknowledged it to be very fitting, that every little social commonwealth should dictate its own matters of discourse; and hoped, ere long, to become a not unworthy member of the one she was now transplanted into.With the prospect of spending at least two months at Uppercross, it was highly incumbent on her to clothe her imagination, her memory, and all her ideas in as much of Uppercross as possible."
"她并不担心这两个月。玛丽并不像伊丽莎白那么令人厌恶和缺乏姐妹感情，也不是那样不受她的影响；乡舍里的其他成员也没有什么令人不快的事情。她同妹夫的关系一向很友好。两个孩子几乎像爱自己的母亲一样爱她，而对她的尊敬则大大超过了对他们母亲的尊敬。她很关心这两个孩子，把照顾他们看成是一件乐事和有益的活动。","She had no dread of these two months.Mary was not so repulsive and unsisterly as Elizabeth, nor so inaccessible to all influence of hers; neither was there anything among the other component parts of the cottage inimical to comfort.She was always on friendly terms with her brother-in-law; and in the children, who loved her nearly as well, and respected her a great deal more than their mother, she had an object of interest, amusement, and wholesome exertion."
"查尔斯•马斯格罗夫为人谦和有礼，从理智和性情上说，无疑要高于妻子。但他没有才能、不善言辞和缺乏风度，决不会使他同安妮之间的旧事酿成险兆。不过，同拉塞尔夫人一样，安妮也觉得，一桩更为般配的婚姻本可使他有更大的长进；而一位真正有见识的女人可能会改变他的性格，他会因此变得更加庄重，他的行为和追求会更有意义、更理智、更高雅。而在当时的情况下，除了运动，他对其他一切都缺乏热情。他把时间都白白浪费掉了，也没点书或者做点其他有益的事情。他情绪高涨，从来不受妻子情绪时高时低的影响。他容忍玛丽无可理喻的言行，有时真使安妮感到钦佩。总的来说虽然他们经常有点小摩擦（由于受到双方的恳求，她自己有时也身不由己地给卷了进去），他们还算是一对幸福的夫妻。他们在谋求更多的钱财，强烈地想从查尔斯的父亲那里索取更为可观的礼物方面，却是志同道合的。不过，如同在许多其他问题上一样，查尔斯在这方面的表现总要检点一点。玛丽认为，他父亲不给他们这样的礼物是一件耻辱的事，而查尔斯总是争辩说，父亲的钱要派在许多用场上，他有权按照自己的意愿花钱。","Charles Musgrove was civil and agreeable; in sense and temper he was undoubtedly superior to his wife, but not of powers, or conversation, or grace, to make the past, as they were connected together, at all a dangerous contemplation; though, at the same time, Anne could believe, with Lady Russell, that a more equal match might have greatly improved him; and that a woman of real understanding might have given more consequence to his character, and more usefulness, rationality, and elegance to his habits and pursuits.As it was, he did nothing with much zeal, but sport; and his time was otherwise trifled away, without benefit from books or anything else.He had very good spirits, which never seemed much affected by his wife’s occasional lowness, bore with her unreasonableness sometimes to Anne’s admiration, and upon the whole, though there was very often a little disagreement (in which she had sometimes more share than she wished, being appealed to by both parties), they might pass for a happy couple.They were always perfectly agreed in the want of more money, and a strong inclination for a handsome present from his father; but here, as on most topics, he had the superiority, for while Mary thought it a great shame that such a present was not made, he always contended for his father’s having many other uses for his money, and a right to spend it as he liked."
"在教育孩子的问题上，查尔斯的主张比妻子强得多，而且实践效果也不错。“要不是玛丽从中干预，我本来可以将他们管教得更好。”安妮常常听到查尔斯这么说，而且也十分相信这一点。反过来又常常听见玛丽责怪说：“查尔斯把孩子们宠坏了，我简直没法管教他们。”这时安妮从来都不想说一声“真是这样”。","As to the management of their children, his theory was much better than his wife’s, and his practice not so bad.“I could manage them very well, if it were not for Mary’s interference,” was what Anne often heard him say, and had a good deal of faith in; but when listening in turn to Mary’s reproach of “Charles spoils the children so that I cannot get them into any order,” she never had the smallest temptation to say, “Very true.”"
"安妮住在这里感到最不愉快的一点，就是各方都过分信任她。她对两家人的私下埋怨也了解得太多了。大家都知道她对妹妹有一定的影响，因而不切实际地请求她，或者至少是暗示，要她去施加这一影响。“我希望你去劝劝玛丽，不要老是想象身体不舒服。”这是查尔斯的话。可是玛丽却很不高兴地说：“我确实觉得，查尔斯即使见到我快要咽气了，还会以为我一点毛病也没有呢。我确信，安妮，如果你愿意，你可以告诉他，我确实病得很厉害，比我说的要厉害得多。”","One of the least agreeable circumstances of her residence there was her being treated with too much confidence by all parties, and being too much in the secret of the complaints of each house.Known to have some influence with her sister, she was continually requested, or at least receiving hints to exert it, beyond what was practicable.“I wish you could persuade Mary not to be always fancying herself ill,” was Charles’s language; and, in an unhappy mood, thus spoke Mary: “I do believe if Charles were to see me dying, he would not think there was anything the matter with me.I am sure, Anne, if you would, you might persuade him that I really am very ill—a great deal worse than I ever own.”"
"玛丽宣称：“虽然孩子的祖母总想见见他们，可我实在是不愿意把他们送到老宅去，因为她太迁就、太纵容他们了。给他们吃那么多的杂食和甜食，以至于他们回来以后，后半天准是不舒服，无精打采的。”可是，马斯格罗夫太太一有机会和安妮单独相处，就说：“哎！安妮小姐，我真希望查尔斯太太能采用你管教孩子的一些方法。她们跟你在一起时完全变了样。不过有一点是肯定的，总的来说，他们给惯坏了！真遗憾，你不能让你妹妹好好管管他们。可以毫不偏心地说，这两个孩子是人们见到的最漂亮和最健康的孩子，可怜的小宝贝！可是查尔斯太太根本不懂得如何管教他们！天哪！有时候他们也真让人心烦。不瞒你说，安妮小姐，这就使我不愿意在家里看到他们，不然的话，我会多见见他们的。我知道，查尔斯太太对我不常邀请他们，是不太高兴的。不过你知道，跟那些随时都要管教的孩子在一起是非常令人不快的，叫他们‘别干这个’，‘别干那个’。要想让他们老实一点，就只能多给他们一些点心，而吃多了又对他们不好。”","Mary’s declaration was, “I hate sending the children to the Great House, though their grandmamma is always wanting to see them, for she humours and indulges them to such a degree, and gives them so much trash and sweet things, that they are sure to come back sick and cross for the rest of the day.” And Mrs. Musgrove took the first opportunity of being alone with Anne, to say, “Oh!Miss Anne, I cannot help wishing Mrs. Charles had a little of your method with those children.They are quite different creatures with you!But to be sure, in general they are so spoilt!It is a pity you cannot put your sister in the way of managing them.They are as fine healthy children as ever were seen, poor little dears!without partiality; but Mrs. Charles knows no more how they should be treated—!Bless me!how troublesome they are sometimes.I assure you, Miss Anne, it prevents my wishing to see them at our house so often as I otherwise should.I believe Mrs. Charles is not quite pleased with my not inviting them oftener; but you know it is very bad to have children with one that one is obligated to be checking every moment; “don’t do this,” and “don’t do that;” or that one can only keep in tolerable order by more cake than is good for them.”"
"此外，安妮还听玛丽说过：“马斯格罗夫太太认为她的佣人都十分可靠，要是对此有所怀疑就是大逆不道。但是我可以毫不夸张地告诉你，她的贴身女佣和洗衣女佣都不大干活，整天在村子里闲逛。我无论走到哪里都能碰到她们，我敢说，我只要到育儿室去两次就能碰到她们。杰迈玛要不是这世上最忠实可靠的仆人，早就被带坏了。她告诉我说，她们总是诱惑她一同出去散步。可到了马斯格罗夫太太嘴里，话就变成了这样：“我立了一条规矩，决不干预儿媳妇的任何事情，因为我知道，这么做不好。但是，我要告诉你，安妮小姐，因为你也许能把事情纠正过来，我对为查尔斯太太带孩子的保姆没有好感：我听说了她的一些怪事，她总是到处闲逛。据我所知，我敢说，她的确是个打扮得花枝招展的女人，周围任何佣人接近她都会被她带坏。我知道，查尔斯太太非常信赖她。但我只不过提醒你，好让你留心一些。你如果看到什么不对头的地方，就请直言不讳地说出来。”","She had this communication, moreover, from Mary.“Mrs. Musgrove thinks all her servants so steady, that it would be high treason to call it in question; but I am sure, without exaggeration, that her upper house-maid and laundry-maid, instead of being in their business, are gadding about the village, all day long.I meet them wherever I go; and I declare, I never go twice into my nursery without seeing something of them.If Jemima were not the trustiest, steadiest creature in the world, it would be enough to spoil her; for she tells me, they are always tempting her to take a walk with them.”And on Mrs. Musgrove’s side, it was, “I make a rule of never interfering in any of my daughter-in-law’s concerns, for I know it would not do; but I shall tell you, Miss Anne, because you may be able to set things to rights, that I have no very good opinion of Mrs. Charles’s nursery-maid: I hear strange stories of her; she is always upon the gad; and from my own knowledge, I can declare, she is such a fine-dressing lady, that she is enough to ruin any servants she comes near.Mrs. Charles quite swears by her, I know; but I just give you this hint, that you may be upon the watch; because, if you see anything amiss, you need not be afraid of mentioning it.”"
"此外，安妮还抱怨说，当她们在老宅与别人吃饭的时候，马斯格罗夫太太连她应享有的优先权都不给她。她不明白他们为什么对她这么不尊重，以至于她丧失了应有的地位。一天，安妮单独同两位马斯格罗夫小姐一起散步时，其中一位在谈起地位、有地位的人以及对地位的妒羡时说：“我可以毫无顾忌地对你说，有些人对他们地位的看法荒谬至极，因为大家都知道你对于地位是不介意和无所谓的。但是我希望有人能提醒玛丽一下，如果她不是那么固执，尤其是不要总是想抢妈妈的位置的话，那就好多了。没有人会怀疑她比妈妈有优先权，但是如果她不是总坚持这一点的话，也许就会更得体一些。这并不是说妈妈会把这件事记在心上，但是我知道，有许多人已经注意到了这件事。”","Again, it was Mary’s complaint, that Mrs. Musgrove was very apt not to give her the precedence that was her due, when they dined at the Great House with other families; and she did not see any reason why she was to be considered so much at home as to lose her place.And one day when Anne was walking with only the Musgroves, one of them after talking of rank, people of rank, and jealousy of rank, said, “I have no scruple of observing to you, how nonsensical some persons are about their place, because all the world knows how easy and indifferent you are about it; but I wish anybody could give Mary a hint that it would be a great deal better if she were not so very tenacious, especially if she would not be always putting herself forward to take place of mamma.Nobody doubts her right to have precedence of mamma, but it would be more becoming in her not to be always insisting on it.It is not that mamma cares about it the least in the world, but I know it is taken notice of by many persons.”"
"安妮如何才能处理好这些关系呢？她能做的只不过是耐心地倾听，缓解一下别人的抱怨，替双方做些解释。她提醒说如此亲密的邻居，相互间应该多宽容一点。但凡是对她妹妹有好处的话，她都说得更加明白。","How was Anne to set all these matters to rights?She could do little more than listen patiently, soften every grievance, and excuse each to the other; give them all hints of the forbearance necessary between such near neighbours, and make those hints broadest which were meant for her sister’s benefit."
"从其他方面来看，安妮的来访开始得很顺利，进行得也很顺利。由于环境和话题的改变，加上这里离凯林奇有三英里远，安妮的情绪有所好转。玛丽有了一位日常的伴侣，病情也有所好转。她们同老宅的日常交往反倒成了好事。因为她们既没有什么真挚的感情要吐露，没有什么私房话要说，也没有什么事情要做。这种交往的确十分频繁，因为他们每天上午都要见面，几乎没有一个晚上是单独度过的。但是安妮认为要不是能在通常的地方见到马斯格罗夫先生与太太的身影或他们女儿们的谈笑和歌唱，大家不可能过得这么愉快。","In all other respects, her visit began and proceeded very well.Her own spirits improved by change of place and subject, by being removed three miles from Kellynch; Mary’s ailments lessened by having a constant companion, and their daily intercourse with the other family, since there was neither superior affection, confidence, nor employment in the cottage, to be interrupted by it, was rather an advantage.It was certainly carried nearly as far as possible, for they met every morning, and hardly ever spent an evening asunder; but she believed they should not have done so well without the sight of Mr. and Mrs. Musgrove’s respectable forms in the usual places, or without the talking, laughing, and singing of their daughters."
"安妮的钢琴比两位马斯格罗夫小姐弹得要好得多，但是她没有一幅好嗓子，不会弹竖琴，没有慈祥的父母坐在一边自鸣得意地倾听。安妮心中明白，别人并不在乎她的琴艺，请她演奏，只是出于礼貌，或是给别人提提神罢了。安妮知道，她弹琴只能给自己带来愉快，但这已不是新鲜的感觉了。她自从十四岁失去了亲爱的母亲以来，除了一生中很短的一个时期以外，从没感受过被人细心聆听的快乐，从没因别人公正的评价或真心欣赏而受到鼓舞。在音乐这个天地里，她总有一种身世孤单的感觉。马斯格罗夫夫妇只爱听自己女儿的演奏，对别人的演奏则毫不在乎。她为自己感到羞愧，但更多的是为马斯格罗夫小姐感到高兴。","She played a great deal better than either of the Miss Musgroves, but having no voice, no knowledge of the harp, and no fond parents, to sit by and fancy themselves delighted, her performance was little thought of, only out of civility, or to refresh the others, as she was well aware.She knew that when she played she was giving pleasure only to herself; but this was no new sensation.Excepting one short period of her life, she had never, since the age of fourteen, never since the loss of her dear mother, known the happiness of being listened to, or encouraged by any just appreciation or real taste.In music she had been always used to feel alone in the world; and Mr. and Mrs. Musgrove’s fond partiality for their own daughters’ performance, and total indifference to any other person’s, gave her much more pleasure for their sakes, than mortification for her own."
"有时也有其他人来参加老宅的聚会。当地的人并不多，但是马斯格罗夫家却是人人都要去拜访的。他们家举行的晚宴比别人家多，应邀来访的宾客和不速之客的人数也比其他任何人家要多。他们真是受欢迎极了。","The party at the Great House was sometimes increased by other company.The neighbourhood was not large, but the Musgroves were visited by everybody, and had more dinner-parties, and more callers, more visitors by invitation and by chance, than any other family.There were more completely popular."
"马斯格罗夫小姐对跳舞非常狂热，傍晚的聚会偶尔也会变成即兴的小型舞会。就在离阿珀克罗斯几步之遥的地方，住着一家境况不是很宽裕的表亲。这家人的一切娱乐活动都来至马斯格罗夫家，他们随时都能来。让他们参加什么活动，或者到哪里去跳舞都可以。安妮却宁愿担任伴奏的角色，而不愿参加那蹦蹦跳跳的活动，于是常常为他们弹奏乡村舞曲，一弹就是个把小时。比起其他任何活动，她的这种友好的行为更能博得马斯格罗夫夫妇对她音乐才能的赏识，而且她经常受到这样的恭维：“不错，安妮小姐！弹得真好！天哪！你那些小指头弹得真欢快啊！”","The girls were wild for dancing; and the evenings ended, occasionally, in an unpremeditated little ball.There was a family of cousins within a walk of Uppercross, in less affluent circumstances, who depended on the Musgroves for all their pleasures: they would come at any time, and help play at anything, or dance anywhere; and Anne, very much preferring the office of musician to a more active post, played country dances to them by the hour together; a kindness which always recommended her musical powers to the notice of Mr. and Mrs. Musgrove more than anything else, and often drew this compliment;—“Well done, Miss Anne!very well done indeed!Lord bless me!how those little fingers of yours fly about!”"
"最初的三个星期就这样过去了。米迦勒节来临了，这时安妮的心准又回到凯林奇去了。深爱的家让给了别人。那些漂亮的房间、家具、树林以及庭园景色，已开始只供旁人欣赏和游览了。九月二十九日这天，她已没有心思去想别的事情了。晚上，她听到玛丽也有相同的感触。当时因为玛丽因有事要记下当天的日期，便喊了起来：“天哪，这不就是克罗夫特夫妇搬进凯林奇的日子吗？”幸好我当时没有想起过这件事情。一想到这事真叫我难过！”","So passed the first three weeks.Michaelmas came; and now Anne’s heart must be in Kellynch again.A beloved home made over to others; all the precious rooms and furniture, groves, and prospects, beginning to own other eyes and other limbs!She could not think of much else on the 29th of September; and she had this sympathetic touch in the evening from Mary, who, on having occasion to note down the day of the month, exclaimed, “Dear me, is not this the day the Crofts were to come to Kellynch?I am glad I did not think of it before.How low it makes me!”"
"克罗夫特夫妇以不折不扣的海军作风，雷厉风行地搬进了凯林奇府，并且等待着客人拜访。玛丽对自己必须进行这样的拜访感到很遗憾。“谁也不知道她心里有多难受。她想尽可能地推迟这次访问。”但是她又心神不定，最后硬是说服查尔斯早早驾车将她送回去了。回来的时候，她看起来很激动、很高兴、很快活。安妮由于没有交通工具而没去成，她对此反而感到非常高兴。不过她却希望见到克罗夫特夫妇，所以当他们回访的时候，她很高兴自己就在家里。他们来了，房主人不在家，但是两姐妹却在家里。克罗夫特夫人正巧由安妮招待，将军坐在玛丽旁边，乐呵呵地逗着她的两个小儿子，显得非常亲切。安妮完全可以找出克罗夫特太太同她弟弟之间的某些相似之处，这即使在他们的容貌上发现不了，那么也能在声音、性情和谈吐中捕捉到。","The Crofts took possession with true naval alertness, and were to be visited.Mary deplored the necessity for herself.“Nobody knew how much she should suffer.She should put it off as long as she could;” but was not easy till she had talked Charles into driving her over on an early day, and was in a very animated, comfortable state of imaginary agitation, when she came back.Anne had very sincerely rejoiced in there being no means of her going.She wished, however to see the Crofts, and was glad to be within when the visit was returned.They came: the master of the house was not at home, but the two sisters were together; and as it chanced that Mrs. Croft fell to the share of Anne, while the Admiral sat by Mary, and made himself very agreeable by his good-humoured notice of her little boys, she was well able to watch for a likeness, and if it failed her in the features, to catch it in the voice, or in the turn of sentiment and expression."
"克罗夫特太太虽说不高也不胖，但肩宽背直，富有活力，这使他显得很神气。她有一双明亮的棕色眼睛，一口好牙，脸庞总的轮廓很和谐。不过，她在海上生活的时间几乎同她丈夫一样，因而皮肤微红、满面风尘，这就使她看上去比她实际的38岁要老得多。她态度直率、举止大方、作风果断，不像是个缺乏自信的人，做事也毫不迟疑。不过她毫不粗俗，也不缺乏幽默感。但凡牵涉到与凯林奇有关的事情，克罗夫特太太都很照顾安妮的情绪，这让安妮对此很感激。尤其使安妮感到高兴的是，在最初半分钟，就在他们相互介绍的时候，她很满意地看到，没有任何迹象表明，克罗夫特太太对往事有所了解或猜疑，因而不可能对她有任何偏见。安妮在这一点上非常放心，因而显得精神焕发，勇气倍增。直到克罗夫特太太突然冒出了一句话，才使她一下子像触了电似的。","Mrs. Croft, though neither tall nor fat, had a squareness, uprightness, and vigour of form, which gave importance to her person.She had bright dark eyes, good teeth, and altogether an agreeable face; though her reddened and weather-beaten complexion, the consequence of her having been almost as much at sea as her husband, made her seem to have lived some years longer in the world than her real eight-and-thirty.Her manners were open, easy, and decided, like one who had no distrust of herself, and no doubts of what to do; without any approach to coarseness, however, or any want of good humour.Anne gave her credit, indeed, for feelings of great consideration towards herself, in all that related to Kellynch, and it pleased her: especially, as she had satisfied herself in the very first half minute, in the instant even of introduction, that there was not the smallest symptom of any knowledge or suspicion on Mrs. Croft’s side, to give a bias of any sort.She was quite easy on that head, and consequently full of strength and courage, till for a moment electrified by Mrs. Croft’s suddenly saying,—"
"“我发现，我弟弟住在这一带时，有幸结识的是你，而不是你妹妹。”","“It was you, and not your sister, I find, that my brother had the pleasure of being acquainted with, when he was in this country.”"
"安妮希望自己已经过了会脸红的年龄了，但是她激动的年龄显然没有过去。","Anne hoped she had outlived the age of blushing; but the age of emotion she certainly had not."
"“也许你还没听说他已经结婚了吧？”克罗夫特太太又说。","“Perhaps you may not have heard that he is married?” added Mrs. Croft."
"这时，安妮可以该怎么回答就怎么回答了。可是克罗夫特太太以后的话表明她指的是温特沃思先生，安妮高兴地感到她刚才的答话适用于克罗夫特太太的任何一位兄弟。她马上又觉得，克罗夫特太太想的和谈到的应该是爱德华，而不是弗雷德里克。她为自己的健忘而感到羞愧，便饶有兴趣地倾听克罗夫特太太他们以前邻居的目前状况。","She could now answer as she ought; and was happy to feel, when Mrs. Croft’s next words explained it to be Mr. Wentworth of whom she spoke, that she had said nothing which might not do for either brother.She immediately felt how reasonable it was, that Mrs. Croft should be thinking and speaking of Edward, and not of Frederick; and with shame at her own forgetfulness applied herself to the knowledge of their former neighbour’s present state with proper interest."
"余下的时间平平静静地过去了，可是就在他们要动身离开时，她听见海军上将对玛丽说：","The rest was all tranquillity; till, just as they were moving, she heard the Admiral say to Mary—"
"“我们正期待克罗夫特太太的一位弟弟，他不久就要来了。我想你是听说过他的名字吧。”","“We are expecting a brother of Mrs. Croft’s here soon; I dare say you know him by name.”"
"两个小男孩猛地朝将军扑过去，打断了他的话。孩子们像老朋友似的缠住他，扬言不让他走。还要求将军把他们放在大衣口袋里带走，如此等等。这一下把将军的吸引力全带过去了，闹得他没有时间把话说完，甚至也记不得自己说到哪里了。安妮只好尽力安慰自己说，将军指的一定是同一个弟弟。可是，她又没有多大把握，所以很想打听一下上次玛丽他们去拜访克罗夫特夫妇时有没有谈起这方面的事情。","He was cut short by the eager attacks of the little boys, clinging to him like an old friend, and declaring he should not go; and being too much engrossed by proposals of carrying them away in his coat pockets, &c., to have another moment for finishing or recollecting what he had begun, Anne was left to persuade herself, as well as she could, that the same brother must still be in question.She could not, however, reach such a degree of certainty, as not to be anxious to hear whether anything had been said on the subject at the other house, where the Crofts had previously been calling."
"当天晚上，老宅的一家人说好要来乡舍作客的。时值深秋，他们已不会徒步进行这样的访问，所以大家倾耳听着，听是否有马车的声音。这时，马斯格罗夫家的二小姐走了进来。她是来表示歉意的，他们今晚应该呆在家里，这是她带来的第一个坏消息。玛丽快要生气了，可是路易莎说她之所以自己徒步走来是为了给竖琴让地方，因为竖琴放在马车里给拉来了。","The folks of the Great House were to spend the evening of this day at the Cottage; and it being now too late in the year for such visits to be made on foot, the coach was beginning to be listened for, when the youngest Miss Musgrove walked in.That she was coming to apologize, and that they should have to spend the evening by themselves, was the first black idea; and Mary was quite ready to be affronted, when Louisa made all right by saying, that she only came on foot, to leave more room for the harp, which was bringing in the carriage."
"“我要告诉你们理由”，她又补充道，“还有所有的相关事情。我是来通知你们，今天晚上爸爸妈妈的心情很不好，尤其是妈妈，她一直在想念可怜的理查德！我们大家一致认为，最好能带上竖琴，因为相比钢琴来说，竖琴似乎更能使她开心。现在我把她心情不好的原因告诉你们。今天早上克罗夫特夫妇来拜访我们的时候（后来他们也来过这里，是吗？），他们偶尔谈起，克罗夫特太太的弟弟温特沃思上校刚刚回到英国，或者是退役什么的，马上就要来看望他们。他们走了以后，妈妈倒霉地想起了，温特沃思这个名字，或者名字很相似的人，曾经担任过可怜的理查德的舰长。我不知道是在什么时候或是在什么地方，但是是在他去世之前，可怜的家伙！妈妈翻看了他的信件和遗物，发现情况确实如此。她完全肯定，这就是那个人，她满脑子都在想着这件事，想着可怜的理查德！所以，我们大家必须尽量表现得高兴些，好让她忘掉这些伤心事。”","“And I will tell you our reason,” she added, “and all about it.I am come on to give you notice, that papa and mamma are out of spirits this evening, especially mamma; she is thinking so much of poor Richard!And we agreed it would be best to have the harp, for it seems to amuse her more than the piano-forte.I will tell you why she is out of spirits.When the Crofts called this morning, (they called here afterwards, did not they?), they happened to say, that her brother, Captain Wentworth, is just returned to England, or paid off, or something, and is coming to see them almost directly; and most unluckily it came into mamma’s head, when they were gone, that Wentworth, or something very like it, was the name of poor Richard’s captain at one time; I do not know when or where, but a great while before he died, poor fellow!And upon looking over his letters and things, she found it was so, and is perfectly sure that this must be the very man, and her head is quite full of it, and of poor Richard!So we must be as merry as we can, that she may not be dwelling upon such gloomy things.”"
"这段伤心家史的实际情况是这样的：马斯格罗夫夫妇不幸有过一个令人烦恼的、无可救药的儿子，不过幸运的是，他不到20岁就离开了人世。这孩子非常执拗，在陆上无法加以管教，所以就把他送到海上去了。家里人根本不关心他，这也是他自作自受。很少有人谈起他，两年前他在国外去世的消息传到阿珀克罗斯时，也没有人表示惋惜。","The real circumstances of this pathetic piece of family history were, that the Musgroves had had the ill fortune of a very troublesome, hopeless son; and the good fortune to lose him before he reached his twentieth year; that he had been sent to sea because he was stupid and unmanageable on shore; that he had been very little cared for at any time by his family, though quite as much as he deserved; seldom heard of, and scarcely at all regretted, when the intelligence of his death abroad had worked its way to Uppercross, two years before."
"他的两个妹妹现在尽力为他说好话，称他为“可怜的理查德”，而实际上他不过是一个愚蠢、冷酷而无用的迪克•马斯格罗夫。他一生没有做过任何好事，所以生前死后没有人郑重其事地称呼他的全名。","He had, in fact, though his sisters were now doing all they could for him, by calling him “poor Richard,” been nothing better than a thick-headed, unfeeling, unprofitable Dick Musgrove, who had never done anything to entitle himself to more than the abbreviation of his name, living or dead."
"他在海上服了几年役，当时所有的军官候补生，都经常奉命调动，特别是那些船长们不想要的军官候补生更是如此。就在这频繁的调动中，他曾一度在弗雷德里克•温特沃思上校的护航舰“拉哥尼亚”号上呆过六个月。由于舰长的管教，他在“拉哥尼亚”上时，写过两封家信，这是他父母在他外出期间收到的仅有的两封信。这就是仅有的两封没有不图私利的信，其余的信都不过只是为了要钱。","He had been several years at sea, and had, in the course of those removals to which all midshipmen are liable, and especially such midshipmen as every captain wishes to get rid of, been six months on board Captain Frederick Wentworth’s frigate, the Laconia; and from the Laconia he had, under the influence of his captain, written the only two letters which his father and mother had ever received from him during the whole of his absence; that is to say, the only two disinterested letters; all the rest had been mere applications for money."
"他在两封信中都说了舰长的好话。可是家里人对这些议论一般不太注意，不关心也不想知道船名或船上人的姓名，因此当时没有给他们留下任何印象。今天，马斯格罗夫太太居然会想起温特沃思这个姓氏与他儿子有关，似乎是出于有时会突然闪现的特殊灵感。","In each letter he had spoken well of his captain; but yet, so little were they in the habit of attending to such matters, so unobservant and incurious were they as to the names of men or ships, that it had made scarcely any impression at the time; and that Mrs. Musgrove should have been suddenly struck, this very day, with a recollection of the name of Wentworth, as connected with her son, seemed one of those extraordinary bursts of mind which do sometimes occur."
"马斯格罗夫太太翻阅了一下信件，发现情况跟她想的一模一样。现在她那可怜的儿子已经永远离开了人世，他所犯的错误也已经被人们淡忘，过了这么久再来看这些信件，这对她的情绪打击很大，使她感到十分悲伤。这种悲伤的程度甚至超过了刚听到他死讯时的心情。马斯格罗夫先生也受到了刺激，只是程度轻一点而已。他们夫妇来到庄上时，首先需要别人再听一听这事的原委，然后需要愉快的伙伴给他们以充分的安慰。","She had gone to her letters, and found it all as she supposed; and the re-perusal of these letters, after so long an interval, her poor son gone for ever, and all the strength of his faults forgotten, had affected her spirits exceedingly, and thrown her into greater grief for him than she had know on first hearing of his death.Mr. Musgrove was, in a lesser degree, affected likewise; and when they reached the cottage, they were evidently in want, first, of being listened to anew on this subject, and afterwards, of all the relief which cheerful companions could give them."
"他们大谈而特谈温特沃思上校，一而再再而三地提到他的名字，尽情地回忆着过去的年代，并最后认定，也许他很可能就是他们从克利夫顿回来后记得见过一两次的那个温特沃思上校——一个挺不错的年轻。但是他们说不准这是七年以前还是八年以前的事了。听着他们的这番议论，对安妮的神经是一种新的考验。不过，她觉得，她必须使自己适应这种考验。既然弗雷德里克确实要到这里来了，她应该学会对此事无动于衷。问题不仅仅在于她要来，而且很快就来，还在于马斯格罗夫一家充满着感激之情，因为他曾经好心地照顾过可怜的迪克。他们非常钦佩他的为人，因为可怜的迪克在他的关照下干过六个月，并在错别字不少的信中热情赞扬他是“一个勇敢地好家火，只是对学员太严各。”看来，只要一听到他到来的消息，他们要立刻去拜访，同他交个朋友。","To hear them talking so much of Captain Wentworth, repeating his name so often, puzzling over past years, and at last ascertaining that it might, that it probably would, turn out to be the very same Captain Wentworth whom they recollected meeting, once or twice, after their coming back from Clifton—a very fine young man—but they could not say whether it was seven or eight years ago, was a new sort of trial to Anne’s nerves.She found, however, that it was one to which she must inure herself.Since he actually was expected in the country, she must teach herself to be insensible on such points.And not only did it appear that he was expected, and speedily, but the Musgroves, in their warm gratitude for the kindness he had shewn poor Dick, and very high respect for his character, stamped as it was by poor Dick’s having been six months under his care, and mentioning him in strong, though not perfectly well-spelt praise, as “a fine dashing felow, only two perticular about the schoolmaster,” were bent on introducing themselves, and seeking his acquaintance, as soon as they could hear of his arrival."
"这一决定给他们当天晚上的聚会带来了安慰。","The resolution of doing so helped to form the comfort of their evening."
"第七章","CHAPTER 7"
"没过几天，人们就听说温特沃思上校到了凯林奇，马斯格罗夫先生便登门拜访，回来时对他赞不绝口。他还和克罗夫特夫妇约定下周末到阿珀克罗斯吃饭。马斯格罗夫先生对于不能把日期提早一些感到很失望。因为他本人太急于想早一些请温特沃思上校到自己家来，用地窖里最烈、最上等的酒来款待他以表达感激之情。但是，他必须得等一个星期。安妮估计，一个星期以后，他们难免要见面。她马上又希望在这一星期中她能够不受到干扰。","A very few days more, and Captain Wentworth was known to be at Kellynch, and Mr. Musgrove had called on him, and come back warm in his praise, and he was engaged with the Crofts to dine at Uppercross, by the end of another week.It had been a great disappointment to Mr. Musgrove to find that no earlier day could be fixed, so impatient was he to shew his gratitude, by seeing Captain Wentworth under his own roof, and welcoming him to all that was strongest and best in his cellars.But a week must pass; only a week, in Anne’s reckoning, and then, she supposed, they must meet; and soon she began to wish that she could feel secure even for a week."
"温特沃思海军上校很早就对马斯格罗夫的礼节性拜访进行了回访。而安妮本来是要在那半个小时里到马斯格罗夫府去的。实际上，她和玛丽当时正朝老宅走去。正如事后她所知，她们本来不可避免会在那里遇到温特沃思上校的。可是就在那时，玛丽的大儿子严重地摔伤了。看到孩子这般情景，大家当然就把出访这件事放在一边了。后来，即使大家很担心孩子的伤势，但安妮在得知自己侥幸躲过了这次会面时，还是不可能无动于衷。","Captain Wentworth made a very early return to Mr. Musgrove’s civility, and she was all but calling there in the same half hour.She and Mary were actually setting forward for the Great House, where, as she afterwards learnt, they must inevitably have found him, when they were stopped by the eldest boy’s being at that moment brought home in consequence of a bad fall.The child’s situation put the visit entirely aside; but she could not hear of her escape with indifference, even in the midst of the serious anxiety which they afterwards felt on his account."
"她们发现孩子的锁骨脱位了，背脊严重受伤，这怎么能不引起严重的恐慌。那是个令人忧伤的下午，安妮马上做了一切安排：派人去请医师；去寻找孩子的父亲，把情况告诉他；安慰孩子的母亲，免得她歇斯底里地发作；还要分派仆人的工作——把最小的孩子带走，照顾并安慰可怜的受伤的孩子。此外，安妮一想起要给老宅里的人报信，就马上就派人去了。可是来人都吓得手足无措，只会问长问短，帮不了什么忙。","His collar-bone was found to be dislocated, and such injury received in the back, as roused the most alarming ideas.It was an afternoon of distress, and Anne had every thing to do at once; the apothecary to send for, the father to have pursued and informed, the mother to support and keep from hysterics, the servants to control, the youngest child to banish, and the poor suffering one to attend and soothe; besides sending, as soon as she recollected it, proper notice to the other house, which brought her an accession rather of frightened, enquiring companions, than of very useful assistants."
"妹夫回来了，这是使安妮宽慰的第一件事，他可以好好地照顾妻子。令人宽慰的第二件事是医师的到来。在他来为孩子检查之前，大家什么也不知道，所以更加害怕。他们怀疑伤势很严重，但不知道伤在哪里。现在，锁骨很快就复位了。虽然鲁滨孙先生摸了又摸，搓着双手，神情严肃地同孩子的父亲和姨母低声交谈着，但大家都巴望孩子的情况是不幸中之大幸，这样大家就能比较安心地离开孩子去吃饭。不料，那两位年轻的姑姑临走之前居然忘记了侄子的伤势，谈了温特沃思上校的来访——她们在父母走后又呆了五分钟，一再表示很喜欢他，觉得他比她们认识并得到她们欢心的其他男子都要英俊、可亲得多。听到爸爸要挽留温特沃思上校吃晚饭，她们是多么高兴，而一听到他说不能留下时，她们又感到非常遗憾。后来听到他接受了爸妈的盛情邀请答应明天来吃饭，便又感到欣喜。就在明天！况且他答应的态度十分愉悦，似乎察觉到了他们盛情邀请的一番厚意。他本来就该这样。总之，他的风度和言谈都十分优雅，她们可以向人们承认，她们两人都被他迷住了。说完两人就匆匆离开了，内心充满了喜悦与情意。显然，她们挂念的是海军上将温特沃思，而不是小查尔斯。","Her brother’s return was the first comfort; he could take best care of his wife; and the second blessing was the arrival of the apothecary.Till he came and had examined the child, their apprehensions were the worse for being vague; they suspected great injury, but knew not where; but now the collar-bone was soon replaced, and though Mr. Robinson felt and felt, and rubbed, and looked grave, and spoke low words both to the father and the aunt, still they were all to hope the best, and to be able to part and eat their dinner in tolerable ease of mind; and then it was, just before they parted, that the two young aunts were able so far to digress from their nephew’s state, as to give the information of Captain Wentworth’s visit; staying five minutes behind their father and mother, to endeavour to express how perfectly delighted they were with him, how much handsomer, how infinitely more agreeable they thought him than any individual among their male acquaintance, who had been at all a favourite before.How glad they had been to hear papa invite him to stay dinner, how sorry when he said it was quite out of his power, and how glad again when he had promised in reply to papa and mamma’s farther pressing invitations to come and dine with them on the morrow—actually on the morrow; and he had promised it in so pleasant a manner, as if he felt all the motive of their attention just as he ought.And in short, he had looked and said everything with such exquisite grace, that they could assure them all, their heads were both turned by him; and off they ran, quite as full of glee as of love, and apparently more full of Captain Wentworth than of little Charles."
"两位小姐陪同她们的父亲在茫茫暮色中来了解孩子的情况时，又重述了一遍这个情节。马斯格罗夫先生已经不再像当初那样为他的继承人担心了，也对此表示肯定和赞美。他希望现在没有什么事会推迟上校赴宴。唯一遗憾的是他儿子一家可能不愿意撇下受伤的孩子而去同上校见面。“哦，不，不能把孩子撇下。”当时孩子的父母十分慌乱，根本不愿意考虑这一点。安妮则庆幸能够避开这次会见，便情不自禁地热情附和着他们的想法。","The same story and the same raptures were repeated, when the two girls came with their father, through the gloom of the evening, to make enquiries; and Mr. Musgrove, no longer under the first uneasiness about his heir, could add his confirmation and praise, and hope there would be now no occasion for putting Captain Wentworth off, and only be sorry to think that the cottage party, probably, would not like to leave the little boy, to give him the meeting.“Oh no; as to leaving the little boy,” both father and mother were in much too strong and recent alarm to bear the thought; and Anne, in the joy of the escape, could not help adding her warm protestations to theirs."
"后来，查尔斯•马斯格罗夫的确表示出点动摇，“孩子现在恢复得挺快，我还真想去结识一下温特沃思上校。因此，我也许可以去参加他们的晚会。我不想在那里吃饭，不过我可以进去呆上半个小时。”可是他妻子强烈地加以反对：“哦，不！真的，查尔斯，我不能让你出去。你想想，万一出什么事呢？”","Charles Musgrove, indeed, afterwards, shewed more of inclination; “the child was going on so well, and he wished so much to be introduced to Captain Wentworth, that, perhaps, he might join them in the evening; he would not dine from home, but he might walk in for half an hour.” But in this he was eagerly opposed by his wife, with “Oh!no, indeed, Charles, I cannot bear to have you go away.Only think if anything should happen?”"
"孩子一夜平安无事，第二天情况也很好。看来还要过一段时间才能确定脊柱是否真正受伤。但是鲁滨孙先生没有发现任何使他们进一步惊慌的症状，于是马斯格罗夫先生便觉得没有必要再守在家里。孩子必须躺在床上，尽量让他安静而愉快。但是在这种场合，一个做父亲的能做些什么呢？这完全是女人的事，既然他在家里起不到什么作用，那么把自己关在家里就非常荒谬。他父亲很希望他能去见见温特沃思上校，既然没有足够的理由加以反对，那么他就应该去跑一趟。结果，他从外面打猎回来以后就大胆地公开表示，他准备马上换衣服，去老宅吃饭。","The child had a good night, and was going on well the next day.It must be a work of time to ascertain that no injury had been done to the spine; but Mr. Robinson found nothing to increase alarm, and Charles Musgrove began, consequently, to feel no necessity for longer confinement.The child was to be kept in bed and amused as quietly as possible; but what was there for a father to do?This was quite a female case, and it would be highly absurd in him, who could be of no use at home, to shut himself up.His father very much wished him to meet Captain Wentworth, and there being no sufficient reason against it, he ought to go; and it ended in his making a bold, public declaration, when he came in from shooting, of his meaning to dress directly, and dine at the other house."
"“孩子的情况好得不能再好了，”他说，”所以我刚才告诉父亲我要去，他觉得我做得很对。亲爱的，有你姐姐跟你在一起，我一点顾虑也没有。你自己不愿意离开孩子，可你看我又帮不上什么忙。要是有什么情况，安妮会打发人去叫我的。”","“Nothing can be going on better than the child,” said he; “so I told my father, just now, that I would come, and he thought me quite right.Your sister being with you, my love, I have no scruple at all.You would not like to leave him yourself, but you see I can be of no use.Anne will send for me if anything is the matter.”"
"夫妻之间往往彼此知道，反对在什么情况下不起作用。根据查尔斯说话的语气，玛丽知道，他已经下定决心要去了，再阻止也无济于事。因此，直到他走出房间，她一句话也没说，可是只有安妮一个人听她说话时，玛丽才说：","Husbands and wives generally understand when opposition will be vain.Mary knew, from Charles’s manner of speaking, that he was quite determined on going, and that it would be of no use to teaze him. She said nothing, therefore, till he was out of the room, but as soon as there was only Anne to hear—"
"“瞧，你和我又被撇下来轮流照看这可怜的孩子，整个晚上不会有任何人来帮我们了！我早就知道会这样。我总是这么倒霉。一遇到什么不高兴的事情，男人们总是可以脱身。查尔斯就像别的男人一样糟糕。真是冷酷无情！我认为他扔下自己可怜的小儿子而自己跑了，这就是冷酷无情。说什么孩子情况良好！他怎么知道孩子情况良好，他怎么知道半个小时以后孩子不会出现突然的变化？我没想到查尔斯会这么冷酷无情。现在可好，他去享乐，而我呢，因为是个可怜的母亲，就不准动弹一下。我敢说，对于照看孩子，我比谁都不合适。正是因为我是孩子的母亲，就不应该折磨我的感情。我根本受不了。你见到了，昨天我是多么的歇斯底里。”","“So you and I are to be left to shift by ourselves, with this poor sick child; and not a creature coming near us all the evening!I knew how it would be.This is always my luck.If there is anything disagreeable going on men are always sure to get out of it, and Charles is as bad as any of them.Very unfeeling!I must say it is very unfeeling of him to be running away from his poor little boy.Talks of his being going on so well!How does he know that he is going on well, or that there may not be a sudden change half an hour hence?I did not think Charles would have been so unfeeling.So here he is to go away and enjoy himself, and because I am the poor mother, I am not to be allowed to stir; and yet, I am sure, I am more unfit than anybody else to be about the child.My being the mother is the very reason why my feelings should not be tried.I am not at all equal to it.You saw how hysterical I was yesterday.”"
"“不过，那只是因为事情发生得很突然，你给吓坏了的缘故。你不会再那么歇斯底里了。我敢说，我们不会遇到什么为难的事了。我完全懂得鲁滨孙的医嘱，一点儿也不担心。说真的，玛丽，我无法对你丈夫的举动感到惊奇。照顾孩子不是男人的事，不属于他管的范围。生病的孩子总是母亲的宝贝，这通常是由母亲本人的感情决定的。”","“But that was only the effect of the suddenness of your alarm—of the shock.You will not be hysterical again.I dare say we shall have nothing to distress us.I perfectly understand Mr. Robinson’s directions, and have no fears; and indeed, Mary, I cannot wonder at your husband.Nursing does not belong to a man; it is not his province.A sick child is always the mother’s property: her own feelings generally make it so.”"
"“我希望我能像别的母亲一样喜欢自己的孩子。可是我知道在病房中，我不见得比查尔斯更有用，因为可怜的孩子生病的时候，我不能老是责骂他、哄他。今天早晨，你看见了，我要是叫他安静，他就偏要乱踢。我的神经可受不了这些。”","“I hope I am as fond of my child as any mother, but I do not know that I am of any more use in the sick-room than Charles, for I cannot be always scolding and teazing the poor child when it is ill; and you saw, this morning, that if I told him to keep quiet, he was sure to begin kicking about.I have not nerves for the sort of thing.”"
"“可是，整个晚上你扔下可怜的孩子，你自己能安心吗？”","“But, could you be comfortable yourself, to be spending the whole evening away from the poor boy?”"
"“能，你看见的，他爸爸能，我为什么不能？杰迈玛是个细心人，她可以每小时把孩子的情况告诉我们。我真希望当初查尔斯应该告诉他的父亲我们都去。我现在也同他一样，不再对查尔斯大惊小怪了。昨天我是非常惊慌，可是今天情况就大不一样了。”","“Yes; you see his papa can, and why should not I?Jemima is so careful; and she could send us word every hour how he was.I really think Charles might as well have told his father we would all come.I am not more alarmed about little Charles now than he is.I was dreadfully alarmed yesterday, but the case is very different to-day.”"
"“好吧，如果你觉得现在通知他们还不晚，也许你可以陪同你丈夫一起去。把小查尔斯交给我照顾。有我照看着他，马斯格罗夫先生与太太不会见怪的。”","“Well, if you do not think it too late to give notice for yourself, suppose you were to go, as well as your husband.Leave little Charles to my care.Mr. and Mrs. Musgrove cannot think it wrong while I remain with him.”"
"“你这话可当真？”玛丽眼睛一亮，大声喊道。“天哪，这可是个好主意，真的，这主意真好。说真的，对我来说去不去都一样。不过我在家里没有用，是吧？那只会让我心烦意乱。你还没有做母亲的感受，所以你留下来是最合适不过了。你可以让小查尔斯做任何事情，他对你总是言听计从。这比把他交给杰迈玛一个人照顾好多了。哦！我当然要去了。我肯定只要有可能，我就应该去，同查尔斯一样。因为他们也非常希望我同温特沃思上校认识认识。我知道，你不会介意一个人留下的。你的主意真好，真的，安妮。我去告诉查尔斯，我马上去做准备。你知道，要是有什么事，你只要派人通知我们，我们一会儿就回来了。不过我敢说，没有什么事会让你为难的。你尽管放心，我要是对我的宝贝儿子不放心，我不会去的。”","“Are you serious?” cried Mary, her eyes brightening.“Dear me!that’s a very good thought, very good, indeed.To be sure, I may just as well go as not, for I am of no use at home—am I?and it only harasses me.You, who have not a mother’s feelings, are a great deal the properest person.You can make little Charles do anything; he always minds you at a word.It will be a great deal better than leaving him only with Jemima.Oh! I shall certainly go; I am sure I ought if I can, quite as much as Charles, for they want me excessively to be acquainted with Captain Wentworth, and I know you do not mind being left alone.An excellent thought of yours, indeed, Anne.I will go and tell Charles, and get ready directly.You can send for us, you know, at a moment’s notice, if anything is the matter; but I dare say there will be nothing to alarm you.I should not go, you may be sure, if I did not feel quite at ease about my dear child.”"
"转眼间，玛丽便去敲丈夫更衣室的门。因为安妮是跟在她后面上楼的，所以刚好听到他们的全部谈话。一开始，玛丽就极兴奋地说道：","The next moment she was tapping at her husband’s dressing-room door, and as Anne followed her up stairs, she was in time for the whole conversation, which began with Mary’s saying, in a tone of great exultation—"
"“我要和你一起去，查尔斯，因为我留在家里也不比你有用。就我整天把自己与孩子关在一起，我也没有办法让他做他任何不愿意做的事情。安妮会留下来的，她答应留在家里照顾他。这是安妮自己提出来的，所以我要和你一起去，这样就好多了，因为星期二以来我还没有在老宅那边吃过饭呢。”","“I mean to go with you, Charles, for I am of no more use at home than you are.If I were to shut myself up for ever with the child, I should not be able to persuade him to do anything he did not like.Anne will stay; Anne undertakes to stay at home and take care of him.It is Anne’s own proposal, and so I shall go with you, which will be a great deal better, for I have not dined at the other house since Tuesday.”"
"“安妮真好，”玛丽的丈夫回答道，“我也很高兴你能去，可是让她单独留在家里照顾我们受伤的孩子，似乎有点不近人情。”","“This is very kind of Anne,” was her husband’s answer, “and I should be very glad to have you go; but it seems rather hard that she should be left at home by herself, to nurse our sick child.”"
"这时，安妮就在近旁，可以表达自己的想法。她态度非常诚恳，玛丽的丈夫很快就相信了，在这种情况下他至少也愿意相信；他对安妮单独留下来用餐这一点毫无顾虑，但是他还是要求她在晚上孩子都入睡以后到他们那里去，还好心劝她同意由他来接她。可是安妮一点也不听劝告，结果不一会儿，她便高兴地目送他们兴致勃勃地离去。她希望他们去了能快活一下，尽管这种快乐心情看起来似乎很奇特。至于她自己呢，留下来使她得到的安慰或许同往常一样。她知道孩子最需要她，至于弗雷德里克•温特沃思，即使他在半里之外向别人献殷勤，这同她安妮有什么关系？","Anne was now at hand to take up her own cause, and the sincerity of her manner being soon sufficient to convince him, where conviction was at least very agreeable, he had no farther scruples as to her being left to dine alone, though he still wanted her to join them in the evening, when the child might be at rest for the night, and kindly urged her to let him come and fetch her, but she was quite unpersuadable; and this being the case, she had ere long the pleasure of seeing them set off together in high spirits.They were gone, she hoped, to be happy, however oddly constructed such happiness might seem; as for herself, she was left with as many sensations of comfort, as were, perhaps, ever likely to be hers.She knew herself to be of the first utility to the child; and what was it to her if Frederick Wentworth were only half a mile distant, making himself agreeable to others?"
"她很想知道他对他们俩的会面会怎么想。他也许是无所谓，如果在这种情况下可以做到无所谓的话。他要么感到无所谓，要么不愿意同她见面。如果以前他想见她，他根本不需要等到今天。当时他们缺乏的就是经济独立，而后来的机遇早已使弗雷德里克发了财，那时他就可以同她见面的。如果她处在弗雷德里克的位置，她肯定早就这么做了。","She would have liked to know how he felt as to a meeting.Perhaps indifferent, if indifference could exist under such circumstances.He must be either indifferent or unwilling.Had he wished ever to see her again, he need not have waited till this time; he would have done what she could not but believe that in his place she should have done long ago, when events had been early giving him the independence which alone had been wanting."
"她妹妹和妹夫回来了，他们对这个新朋友和整个拜访都很满意。他们在那儿弹琴、唱歌、聊天、欢笑，一切都非常愉快。温特沃思上校风度翩翩，既不羞怯也不拘谨。大家似乎早就非常熟悉。他准备第二天早晨与查尔斯一同打猎。他要来吃早饭，可是不到乡舍里来。虽然最初有人这么提出过，但是后来又有人坚持让他去老宅。他似乎也怕影响查尔斯•马斯格罗夫太太对孩子的照顾，这样一来，不知怎么的，结果说定查尔斯到父亲家与他共进晚餐。","Her brother and sister came back delighted with their new acquaintance, and their visit in general.There had been music, singing, talking, laughing, all that was most agreeable; charming manners in Captain Wentworth, no shyness or reserve; they seemed all to know each other perfectly, and he was coming the very next morning to shoot with Charles.He was to come to breakfast, but not at the Cottage, though that had been proposed at first; but then he had been pressed to come to the Great House instead, and he seemed afraid of being in Mrs. Charles Musgrove’s way, on account of the child, and therefore, somehow, they hardly knew how, it ended in Charles’s being to meet him to breakfast at his father’s."
"安妮心里明白。弗雷德里克是在躲避她。她听说，他曾经略略地问起过她，就像问起一个以前的普通熟人一样。看来弗雷德里克似乎同安妮一样认为，或者意识到，在将来他们相遇时好回避介绍。","Anne understood it.He wished to avoid seeing her.He had inquired after her, she found, slightly, as might suit a former slight acquaintance, seeming to acknowledge such as she had acknowledged, actuated, perhaps, by the same view of escaping introduction when they were to meet."
"乡舍早晨的活动时间总是比老宅晚一些，但是第二天情况就相差很多了。玛丽和安妮刚刚开始吃早餐，查尔斯就走进来说，他们就要出发了，他是回来带猎狗的。他的两个妹妹同温特沃思上校随后就到。他的妹妹们要来看看玛丽和孩子，上校提出说，如果方便的话他也想短暂地拜会一下女主人。查尔斯一再说孩子很好，不会有什么不便之处，上校还是要他先跑来打个招呼才行。","The morning hours of the Cottage were always later than those of the other house, and on the morrow the difference was so great that Mary and Anne were not more than beginning breakfast when Charles came in to say that they were just setting off, that he was come for his dogs, that his sisters were following with Captain Wentworth; his sisters meaning to visit Mary and the child, and Captain Wentworth proposing also to wait on her for a few minutes if not inconvenient; and though Charles had answered for the child’s being in no such state as could make it inconvenient, Captain Wentworth would not be satisfied without his running on to give notice."
"玛丽十分感激上校礼貌周到，很高兴地要接待他。可是安妮却百感交集，不过其中最令人欣慰的是这次会见是非常短暂的。这件事的确很快就过去了。查尔斯来通知后不到两分钟，其他人就来了，当时她们正在客厅内。安妮的眼神与温特沃思上校只接触了一下，他鞠了一个躬，她行了一个屈膝礼。安妮听见了他的声音，他跟玛丽在说话，言谈十分得体。他对两位马斯格罗夫小姐说了几句话，以表示他们的关系非常随便。客厅里看起来满满当当的，又是人又是说话声，但是几分钟后，这一切就都结束了。查尔斯只在窗外露了露面，说一切都准备好了，温特沃思上校欠了欠身，告辞走了，两位马斯格罗夫小姐也走了，她们突然决定要陪两位猎人走到村头。屋里清静了，安妮这才勉强把她的早餐吃完。","Mary, very much gratified by this attention, was delighted to receive him, while a thousand feelings rushed on Anne, of which this was the most consoling, that it would soon be over.And it was soon over.In two minutes after Charles’s preparation, the others appeared; they were in the drawing-room.Her eye half met Captain Wentworth’s, a bow, a curtsey passed; she heard his voice; he talked to Mary, said all that was right, said something to the Miss Musgroves, enough to mark an easy footing; the room seemed full, full of persons and voices, but a few minutes ended it.Charles shewed himself at the window, all was ready, their visitor had bowed and was gone, the Miss Musgroves were gone too, suddenly resolving to walk to the end of the village with the sportsmen: the room was cleared, and Anne might finish her breakfast as she could."
"“过去了！过去了！”她怀着紧张而感激的心情，一遍又一遍地想着。“最糟糕的时刻已经过去了！”","“It is over!it is over!” she repeated to herself again and again, in nervous gratitude.“The worst is over!”"
"玛丽在跟她说些什么，可是安妮没有听进去。她见到他了。他们已经见了面了。他们又一次在同一个房间里呆了一会儿。","Mary talked, but she could not attend.She had seen him.They had met.They had been once more in the same room."
"不过，她很快便规劝自己不要想太多。八年了，自从他们断绝关系以来已经过去八年了。这么长期的别离早已经把激情推到了遥远而模糊的过去，现在再这么激动，该是多么荒唐！八年中还有什么不可能发生呢？各种各样的事件、变故、疏远、淡漠——这期间一定包罗了种种的变化，还有对过去时光的忘却——这是多么自然，而且多么肯定无疑！这八年几乎构成了她生命的三分之一。","Soon, however, she began to reason with herself, and try to be feeling less.Eight years, almost eight years had passed, since all had been given up.How absurd to be resuming the agitation which such an interval had banished into distance and indistinctness!What might not eight years do?Events of every description, changes, alienations, removals—all, all must be comprised in it, and oblivion of the past—how natural, how certain too!It included nearly a third part of her own life."
"啊！尽管这样开导自己，安妮发现对于记忆犹新的感情来说，八年的时间几乎算不了什么。","Alas!with all her reasoning, she found, that to retentive feelings eight years may be little more than nothing."
"那么，如何来理解他的感情呢？是不是想避开她？她马上又痛恨自己怎么会提出这样愚蠢的问题。","Now, how were his sentiments to be read?Was this like wishing to avoid her?And the next moment she was hating herself for the folly which asked the question."
"还有一个问题，也许是安妮再明智也无法回避的。不过，很快她就无须对此再感到忐忑不安了。因为在两位马斯格罗夫小姐回来并且结束了她们在乡舍的拜访之后，玛丽就主动告诉她说：","On one other question which perhaps her utmost wisdom might not have prevented, she was soon spared all suspense; for, after the Miss Musgroves had returned and finished their visit at the Cottage she had this spontaneous information from Mary:—"
"“温特沃思上校对你不太感兴趣，安妮，但是对我确实很殷勤。他们离开这里以后，亨里埃塔问他对你印象如何。他说你变化很大，他简直认不出你来了。”","“Captain Wentworth is not very gallant by you, Anne, though he was so attentive to me. Henrietta asked him what he thought of you, when they went away, and he said, ‘You were so altered he should not have known you again.’”"
"玛丽平常并不怎么尊重自己的姐姐，不过她这次完全没有想到这会伤害到安妮的感情。","Mary had no feelings to make her respect her sister’s in a common way, but she was perfectly unsuspicious of being inflicting any peculiar wound."
"“变得他认不出来了。”安妮完全承认这一点，羞愧不语。事实确实如此，而且她还不能为此报复，因为他并没有改变，或者说没有变差。她心中早已承认了这一点，她不能再有别的想法，让他爱怎么想就怎么想吧。不，岁月使她失去了青春与美貌，却使弗雷德里克更加荣光焕发，更富有男子气，更加胸怀坦荡，丝毫没有减弱他的个人风采。她见到的还是当年那个弗雷德里克•温特沃思。","“Altered beyond his knowledge.”Anne fully submitted, in silent, deep mortification.Doubtless it was so, and she could take no revenge, for he was not altered, or not for the worse.She had already acknowledged it to herself, and she could not think differently, let him think of her as he would.No: the years which had destroyed her youth and bloom had only given him a more glowing, manly, open look, in no respect lessening his personal advantages.She had seen the same Frederick Wentworth."
"“你变化这么大，他简直认不出你来了！”这句话时不时会在她脑海中浮现。但是，不久安妮就觉得这些话倒令人高兴。这些话使她头脑清醒，情绪缓和，镇定自若，因而使她感到更加高兴。","“So altered that he should not have known her again!”These were words which could not but dwell with her.Yet she soon began to rejoice that she had heard them.They were of sobering tendency; they allayed agitation; they composed, and consequently must make her happier."
"弗雷德里克•温特沃思确实说过这些话或者说过类似的话，但是从来没有想到这些话会传到安妮的耳朵里。他认为安妮变丑了，因而别人一问起来，他就把自己的感觉如实地说出。他还没有原谅安妮•埃利奥特。安妮亏待了他，抛弃了他，使他感到失望。而且更糟糕的是，她这么做表现了她性格的软弱，这是弗雷德里克果断、自信的性格所无法忍受的。安妮是听信了别人的话而抛弃了他。这是别人过度劝说的结果。这就是软弱与怯懦。","Frederick Wentworth had used such words, or something like them, but without an idea that they would be carried round to her.He had thought her wretchedly altered, and in the first moment of appeal, had spoken as he felt.He had not forgiven Anne Elliot.She had used him ill, deserted and disappointed him; and worse, she had shewn a feebleness of character in doing so, which his own decided, confident temper could not endure.She had given him up to oblige others.It had been the effect of over-persuasion.It had been weakness and timidity."
"他曾经对她一往情深，而且从那以后还从来没有遇见一个可以与她相媲美的女子。但是除了某种自然的好奇心以外，他不想再见到安妮。对他来说，安妮早已失去了魅力。","He had been most warmly attached to her, and had never seen a woman since whom he thought her equal; but, except from some natural sensation of curiosity, he had no desire of meeting her again.Her power with him was gone for ever."
"他现在的目标是结婚。他现在富有，而且又从海上转到了岸上工作。他一心想过上安定的生活，只要这生活对他有足够的吸引力。他实际上是在四处寻找，希望在清醒的头脑和敏捷的审美力允许的限度内尽快地坠入情网。他对两位马斯格罗夫小姐都有意思，只要她们能抓住他的感情就行。总之，他遇到的任何一位动人的姑娘都能使他动心，除了安妮•埃利奥特。在回答他姐姐的猜测时，他心中偷偷把安妮排除在外。","It was now his object to marry.He was rich, and being turned on shore, fully intended to settle as soon as he could be properly tempted; actually looking round, ready to fall in love with all the speed which a clear head and a quick taste could allow.He had a heart for either of the Miss Musgroves, if they could catch it; a heart, in short, for any pleasing young woman who came in his way, excepting Anne Elliot.This was his only secret exception, when he said to his sister, in answer to her suppositions:—"
"“是的，索菲娅，我正准备做一件傻事——结婚。我可能向任何一个年龄在15岁至30岁之间的女子求婚。只要稍微有点姿色，有几分笑容，对海军赞美几句，我就会被俘虏。对一个没在女人堆里呆过、没受过女人调教的水手来说，这不就足够了吗？”","“Yes, here I am, Sophia, quite ready to make a foolish match.Anybody between fifteen and thirty may have me for asking.A little beauty, and a few smiles, and a few compliments to the navy, and I am a lost man.Should not this be enough for a sailor, who has had no society among women to make him nice?”"
"做姐姐的知道，他说这话是要别人进行反驳。他那双明亮而骄傲的眼睛说明他完全相信自己已经很不错了。当他一本正经地说明他想要结交的女性的特征时，他并没有忘记安妮•埃利奥特。“意志坚强，举止柔美”，构成了他所描述的女性特征的全部内容。","He said it, she knew, to be contradicted.His bright proud eye spoke the conviction that he was nice; and Anne Elliot was not out of his thoughts, when he more seriously described the woman he should wish to meet with.“A strong mind, with sweetness of manner,” made the first and the last of the description."
"“这就是我想要的女人，”他说，“略差一点我当然可以接受，但是不能相差过大。如果我是一个傻子，那我确实是一个十足的傻瓜，因为我在这件事情上比大多数人考虑得要多。”","“That is the woman I want,” said he.“Something a little inferior I shall of course put up with, but it must not be much.If I am a fool, I shall be a fool indeed, for I have thought on the subject more than most men.”"
"第八章","CHAPTER 8"
"从此以后，温特沃思海军上校与安妮•埃利奥特便经常在同一社交圈子里活动。他们很快就要在马斯格罗夫家里共进晚餐了，因为小男孩的伤势好得差不多了，不能再成为他的姨妈不能来参加的借口了。这只不过是其他宴请与聚会的开始。","From this time Captain Wentworth and Anne Elliot were repeatedly in the same circle.They were soon dining in company together at Mr. Musgrove’s, for the little boy’s state could no longer supply his aunt with a pretence for absenting herself; and this was but the beginning of other dinings and other meetings."
"往日的感情能否恢复，这要经受一番考验。双方肯定会回忆起过去的时光，因为谈话无法回避那些时光。每当涉及一些详细情景的描述，弗雷德里克不得不提及他们订婚的那年。他的职业练就了他能说会道的本领，他的性格又使他善于闲谈。“那是在1806年，”“那是在1806年我出海远航之前，”他们在一起度过的头一天晚上他就谈到了。尽管他的声音没有颤抖，尽管安妮没有理由认为他在说这番话的时候将眼睛投向了她，但是根据她对他心思的了解，安妮觉得他绝不可能不像她一样回想起过去的时光。他们彼此一定都同样会触景生情，尽管她远不能确定这种想法带来的痛楚是否相等。","Whether former feelings were to be renewed must be brought to the proof; former times must undoubtedly be brought to the recollection of each; they could not but be reverted to; the year of their engagement could not but be named by him, in the little narratives or descriptions which conversation called forth.His profession qualified him, his disposition lead him, to talk; and “That was in the year six;” “That happened before I went to sea in the year six,” occurred in the course of the first evening they spent together: and though his voice did not falter, and though she had no reason to suppose his eye wandering towards her while he spoke, Anne felt the utter impossibility, from her knowledge of his mind, that he could be unvisited by remembrance any more than herself.There must be the same immediate association of thought, though she was very far from conceiving it to be of equal pain."
"他们在一起无话可说，只是出于最起码的礼貌寒暄几句。而曾经他们是有那么多话可以说！现在却无话可说！曾经有过那么一段时间，在如今聚集于阿珀克罗斯客厅的所有人中，就数他们两个之间的交谈是最难停止的。也许除了看起来特别相亲相爱的克罗夫特将军和太太以外（安妮认为，即使是在新婚夫妇中也不会有其他的意外），没有人会像安妮和弗雷德里克如此心心相印，如此情投意合，如此和颜悦色。现在他们就是陌生人，不，还不如陌生人，因为他们永远也无法深交了。这是永久的疏远。","They had no conversation together, no intercourse but what the commonest civility required.Once so much to each other!Now nothing!There had been a time, when of all the large party now filling the drawing-room at Uppercross, they would have found it most difficult to cease to speak to one another.With the exception, perhaps, of Admiral and Mrs. Croft, who seemed particularly attached and happy, (Anne could allow no other exceptions even among the married couples), there could have been no two hearts so open, no tastes so similar, no feelings so in unison, no countenances so beloved.Now they were as strangers; nay, worse than strangers, for they could never become acquainted.It was a perpetual estrangement."
"他说话的时候，安妮听到他嗓音依旧，觉得他心境依旧。大家对海上生活一般都很不了解，因此在聚会上对弗雷德里克问了很多问题，尤其是两位马斯格罗夫小姐，她们的全部注意力似乎都集中在他身上。一再地问起船上的生活方式，日常的规则制度，饮食和作息时间等等。听着弗雷德里克的叙述，了解到那里的实际设施和安排竟然到了这种地步，她们不禁感到非常吃惊，这就引得弗雷德里克说了几句讨人喜欢的嘲笑话。这情景勾起安妮对往事的回忆。那时她也很无知，弗雷德里克也曾说过她，因为她以为水手在船上没有东西可吃，即使有东西，也没有厨师加工，没有仆人伺候，没有刀叉可用。","When he talked, she heard the same voice, and discerned the same mind.There was a very general ignorance of all naval matters throughout the party; and he was very much questioned, and especially by the two Miss Musgroves, who seemed hardly to have any eyes but for him, as to the manner of living on board, daily regulations, food, hours, &c., and their surprise at his accounts, at learning the degree of accommodation and arrangement which was practicable, drew from him some pleasant ridicule, which reminded Anne of the early days when she too had been ignorant, and she too had been accused of supposing sailors to be living on board without anything to eat, or any cook to dress it if there were, or any servant to wait, or any knife and fork to use."
"当安妮这么听着想着时，马斯格罗夫太太的耳语使她回过神来，原来马斯格罗夫太太内心充满了慈母的痛惜，冒出了一句：","From thus listening and thinking, she was roused by a whisper of Mrs. Musgrove’s who, overcome by fond regrets, could not help saying—"
"“啊！安妮小姐，要是老天爷肯饶我可怜的儿子一命，也许到今天，他也会是这样的。”","“Ah!Miss Anne, if it had pleased Heaven to spare my poor son, I dare say he would have been just such another by this time.”"
"安妮忍住了笑，好心地听着，马斯格罗夫太太又跟她诉说了几句心里话，因此，安妮有一阵没有听清楚其他人的谈话。","Anne suppressed a smile, and listened kindly, while Mrs. Musgrove relieved her heart a little more; and for a few minutes, therefore, could not keep pace with the conversation of the others."
"安妮把思绪转入正常轨道以后，发现两位马斯格罗夫小姐正拿起海军花名册（她们自己的海军花名册，阿珀克罗斯有史以来的第一份），坐在一起进行研究，声称要找出温特沃思上校指挥过的军舰。","When she could let her attention take its natural course again, she found the Miss Musgroves just fetching the Navy List (their own navy list, the first that had ever been at Uppercross), and sitting down together to pore over it, with the professed view of finding out the ships that Captain Wentworth had commanded."
"“我记得你的第一艘是‘阿斯普号’，我们来看看‘阿斯普号’在什么地方。”","“Your first was the Asp, I remember; we will look for the Asp.”"
"“你们在那里是找不到的。它已经破旧不堪、不能再用了。我是这艘船的最后一个指挥官。当时这艘船已不能服役。据说还能在国内航运业中用上一两年，所以我就被派到西印度群岛去了。”","“You will not find her there.Quite worn out and broken up.I was the last man who commanded her.Hardly fit for service then.Reported fit for home service for a year or two, and so I was sent off to the West Indies.”"
"两位小姐显得非常惊讶。","The girls looked all amazement."
"他接着说，“海军部的官员偶尔开玩笑，派几百人乘坐不能用的军舰去航海。但是他们要养活很多人，对那些沉入海底也无妨的成千上万人当中，他们难以辨别哪些人最没有人惦念。”","“The Admiralty,” he continued, “entertain themselves now and then, with sending a few hundred men to sea, in a ship not fit to be employed.But they have a great many to provide for; and among the thousands that may just as well go to the bottom as not, it is impossible for them to distinguish the very set who may be least missed.”"
"“啧！啧！”将军大声说，“这些年轻人在胡说些什么呀！当年没有比‘阿普斯号’更好的舰艇了。作为一艘很久以前造的舰艇，你很难找到可以同它媲美的了。能得到这艘舰艇的人该有多幸运呀！他自知当时有二十个比他更强的人同时申请要指挥这艘舰艇。凭他那点本事，他能这么快得到它，已经够幸运了。”","“Phoo!phoo!” cried the Admiral, “what stuff these young fellows talk!Never was a better sloop than the Asp in her day.For an old built sloop, you would not see her equal.Lucky fellow to get her!He knows there must have been twenty better men than himself applying for her at the same time.Lucky fellow to get anything so soon, with no more interest than his.”"
"“将军，我知道我很幸运，我向你保证，”温特沃思上校严肃地回答道，“我对自己的任命非常满意，就像你希望的一样。当时我的最大目标就是出海。一个非常重要的目标就是我想做点事。”","“I felt my luck, Admiral, I assure you;” replied Captain Wentworth, seriously.“I was as well satisfied with my appointment as you can desire.It was a great object with me at that time to be at sea; a very great object, I wanted to be doing something.”"
"“你当然想了。像你这样的年轻小伙子，在岸上呆上半年，能干些什么？如果一个年轻人没有妻子，他很快就会想再次出海的。”","“To be sure you did.What should a young fellow like you do ashore for half a year together?If a man had not a wife, he soon wants to be afloat again.”"
"“不过，温特沃思上校，”路易莎喊道，”你登上‘阿普斯号‘，一看到他们给你的是一艘旧舰艇，一定很恼火吧。“","“But, Captain Wentworth,” cried Louisa, “how vexed you must have been when you came to the Asp, to see what an old thing they had given you.”"
"“在那以前，我就知道这是一艘怎么样的船，”他微笑着说道。“我没有发现更多的情况，就像你们对一件旧皮上衣的款式和耐磨度不可能发现更多的情况一样。因为自从你们记事以来，就看到这件大衣被你们半数的熟人借去穿过；直到后来，某一个大雨天，这件大衣又借给了你们。啊！对我来说，它是一艘可爱的‘阿普斯号’。它实现了我的所有愿望。我早知道它会这样。我知道，要么我们一起沉到海底，要么它就会成全我的理想。我乘这艘船航行时，从来没有遇到过连续两天的恶劣天气。第二年秋天，等我们俘获了足够的私掠船，觉得够意思了，就返航了。我在航海中意外地交了好运，碰到了我想找的那艘法国护卫舰。我把他带到了普利茅斯，在那里我又交了一次好运。我们刚进入海湾还不到六个小时是就刮起了狂风，连续刮了四天四夜，要是可怜的‘阿普斯号’的话，只要被刮上这一半的时间就会完蛋，因为我们同法国的联系也并没有使我们的情况得到很大的改善。要是再过24小时，我就会成为报纸一角的小新闻中一位英勇牺牲的温特沃思上校了。由于是在这么一艘小小的舰艇中丧生的，所以不会有人想起我。”安妮浑身颤抖，不过这种心情只有她自己明白。但是两位马斯格罗夫却可以坦诚而大声地表示她们的同情与恐惧。","“I knew pretty well what she was before that day;” said he, smiling.“I had no more discoveries to make than you would have as to the fashion and strength of any old pelisse, which you had seen lent about among half your acquaintance ever since you could remember, and which at last, on some very wet day, is lent to yourself.Ah! she was a dear old Asp to me.She did all that I wanted.I knew she would.I knew that we should either go to the bottom together, or that she would be the making of me; and I never had two days of foul weather all the time I was at sea in her; and after taking privateers enough to be very entertaining, I had the good luck in my passage home the next autumn, to fall in with the very French frigate I wanted.I brought her into Plymouth; and here another instance of luck.We had not been six hours in the Sound, when a gale came on, which lasted four days and nights, and which would have done for poor old Asp in half the time; our touch with the Great Nation not having much improved our condition.Four-and-twenty hours later, and I should only have been a gallant Captain Wentworth, in a small paragraph at one corner of the newspapers; and being lost in only a sloop, nobody would have thought about me.”Anne’s shudderings were to herself alone; but the Miss Musgroves could be as open as they were sincere, in their exclamations of pity and horror."
"“我想那么是在以后，”马斯格罗夫太太低声说道，像是自言自语，“从那以后他被调到了‘拉科尼亚号’去了，在那里他遇见了我们可怜的儿子。查尔斯，亲爱的，”（她招手让查尔斯到她跟前），“你问问温特沃斯上校，他第一次遇见你那可怜的弟弟实在什么地方。我老记不住。”","“And so then, I suppose,” said Mrs. Musgrove, in a low voice, as if thinking aloud, “so then he went away to the Laconia, and there he met with our poor boy.Charles, my dear,” (beckoning him to her), “do ask Captain Wentworth where it was he first met with your poor brother.I always forgot.”"
"“母亲，我知道，是在直布罗陀。迪克病了，留在直布罗陀。他以前的舰长给温特沃思上校写了封推荐信。”","“It was at Gibraltar, mother, I know.Dick had been left ill at Gibraltar, with a recommendation from his former captain to Captain Wentworth.”"
"“噢！不过，查尔斯，告诉温特沃思上校，他不用在我面前避而不谈可怜的迪克，因为听到这么一个好朋友谈起他倒叫人高兴。”","“Oh!but, Charles, tell Captain Wentworth, he need not be afraid of mentioning poor Dick before me, for it would be rather a pleasure to hear him talked of by such a good friend.”"
"查尔斯对会出现的种种可能性考虑得比较周全，所以只是点点头，便走开了。","Charles, being somewhat more mindful of the probabilities of the case, only nodded in reply, and walked away."
"眼下两位小姐开始翻寻关于“拉科尼亚号”的材料，为了免得她们麻烦，温特沃思上校忍不住高兴地亲手拿起那本宝贝的书，又一次大声朗读这艘船的名字和等级，以及目前已经退役的情况。接着他抬起头说，这艘船也是他拥有的其中一个最好的朋友。","The girls were now hunting for the Laconia; and Captain Wentworth could not deny himself the pleasure of taking the precious volume into his own hands to save them the trouble, and once more read aloud the little statement of her name and rate, and present non-commissioned class, observing over it that she too had been one of the best friends man ever had."
"“啊！我指挥‘拉科尼亚号’的那些日子确实令人愉快！我在船上赚钱赚得多快啊。我和我的一位朋友一起从西印度群岛起锚，出海巡航。可怜的哈维尔，姐姐！你知道，他多么想发财，比我更想。他有妻子。他是个了不起的人。我永远也忘不了他当时兴奋的模样。他之所以高兴，多半是为了他妻子。第二年夏天我在地中海也照样走运，这时我就想起了他。”","“Ah!those were pleasant days when I had the Laconia!How fast I made money in her.A friend of mine and I had such a lovely cruise together off the Western Islands.Poor Harville, sister!You know how much he wanted money: worse than myself.He had a wife.Excellent fellow.I shall never forget his happiness.He felt it all, so much for her sake.I wished for him again the next summer, when I had still the same luck in the Mediterranean.”"
"“先生，我可以肯定地说，”马斯格罗夫太太说，“你就任那艘船船长的日子，也是我们幸运的日子。我们永远也不会忘记你的好意。”","“And I am sure, Sir.” said Mrs. Musgrove, “it was a lucky day for us, when you were put captain into that ship.We shall never forget what you did.”"
"她情绪激动，说话声音很低。温特沃思上校只听清了一部分，可能根本没有想到迪克•马斯格罗夫，所以有些迟疑，似乎在等她说下去。","Her feelings made her speak low; and Captain Wentworth, hearing only in part, and probably not having Dick Musgrove at all near his thoughts, looked rather in suspense, and as if waiting for more."
"“我的哥哥，”一位小姐低声说，“妈妈想起了可怜的理查德。”","“My brother,” whispered one of the girls; “mamma is thinking of poor Richard.”"
"“可怜的好孩子！”马斯格罗夫太太接着说，“他在你的关照下变得这么懂事，经常写信回家！啊！要是他不离开你就好了。说实话，温特沃思上校，我们非常遗憾，他离开了你。”","“Poor dear fellow!” continued Mrs. Musgrove; “he was grown so steady, and such an excellent correspondent, while he was under your care!Ah! it would have been a happy thing, if he had never left you.I assure you, Captain Wentworth, we are very sorry he ever left you.”"
"听到这里，一种表情在温特沃思上校的脸上掠过，只见他明亮的眼睛忽地一闪，那漂亮的嘴微微一撅。安妮意识到，温特沃思上校非但没有分享马斯格罗夫太太对她儿子的良好愿望，反而很可能不愿意提起这个人。但是任何人，如果不像安妮那么了解他，就不可能发现这种稍纵即逝的忍俊不禁的表情。但刹那间，他已控制住自己，显得很严肃，几乎立即走到安妮和马斯格罗夫太太的沙发跟前，在太太身旁坐下，声音低沉而亲切自然地同她谈起她儿子的情形。他表示了极大的同情，表明他充分理解这位母亲的一片无可非议的真情。","There was a momentary expression in Captain Wentworth’s face at this speech, a certain glance of his bright eye, and curl of his handsome mouth, which convinced Anne, that instead of sharing in Mrs. Musgrove’s kind wishes, as to her son, he had probably been at some pains to get rid of him; but it was too transient an indulgence of self-amusement to be detected by any who understood him less than herself; in another moment he was perfectly collected and serious, and almost instantly afterwards coming up to the sofa, on which she and Mrs. Musgrove were sitting, took a place by the latter, and entered into conversation with her, in a low voice, about her son, doing it with so much sympathy and natural grace, as shewed the kindest consideration for all that was real and unabsurd in the parent’s feelings."
"安妮和温特沃思上校实际上坐在同一张沙发上，因为马斯格罗夫太太非常爽快地给他让出了座位。他们之间仅仅隔着马斯格罗夫太太。不过，这确实不是一个微不足道的障碍。马斯格罗夫太太身体肥胖。她的体形天生就适合于表现欢乐愉快，而不是多愁善感；安妮身材苗条，因此，在她沉思的脸庞上表现出的激动心情，可以说是完全给马斯格罗夫太太遮掉了。所以温特沃思上校能平心静气地听着胖胖的太太对儿子命运的叹惜，而儿子在世时却没人惦记。","They were actually on the same sofa, for Mrs. Musgrove had most readily made room for him; they were divided only by Mrs. Musgrove.It was no insignificant barrier, indeed.Mrs. Musgrove was of a comfortable, substantial size, infinitely more fitted by nature to express good cheer and good humour, than tenderness and sentiment; and while the agitations of Anne’s slender form, and pensive face, may be considered as very completely screened, Captain Wentworth should be allowed some credit for the self-command with which he attended to her large fat sighings over the destiny of a son, whom alive nobody had cared for."
"个人的体形和内心的悲痛确实不一定成正比的。身材庞大的人与世界上身材最优雅的人一样，都可以有自己内心的忧伤。但是，无论公正与否，有时两者之间的关联很不恰当。人们的理智无法为之辩解的——是情趣无法容忍的——它只会成为笑柄。","Personal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary proportions.A large bulky figure has as good a right to be in deep affliction, as the most graceful set of limbs in the world.But, fair or not fair, there are unbecoming conjunctions, which reason will patronize in vain—which taste cannot tolerate—which ridicule will seize."
"将军背着双手在房间里来回踱了两三圈，想提提神。他妻子叫他别来回走动，他便来到温特沃思海军上校跟前。他一心想着自己的事儿，没有注意到自己会打断别人的对话，张口就说：","The Admiral, after taking two or three refreshing turns about the room with his hands behind him, being called to order by his wife, now came up to Captain Wentworth, and without any observation of what he might be interrupting, thinking only of his own thoughts, began with—"
"“弗雷德里克，去年春天你要是在里斯本多呆上一星期，就会有人委托你让玛丽•格里尔森夫人和她的几个女儿搭乘你的船了。”","“If you had been a week later at Lisbon, last spring, Frederick, you would have been asked to give a passage to Lady Mary Grierson and her daughters.”"
"“是吗？我倒很庆幸当时没有多呆一星期。”","“Should I?I am glad I was not a week later then.”"
"将军责怪他没有礼貌。他却为自己辩解，说是除了为时几个小时的舞会或访问之外，他决不愿意让任何女士登上他的船。","The Admiral abused him for his want of gallantry.He defended himself; though professing that he would never willingly admit any ladies on board a ship of his, excepting for a ball, or a visit, which a few hours might comprehend."
"“不过，我心里明白，”他说，“这并不是在对待女士上缺乏礼貌。我所考虑的是，不管我们怎么努力，做出多大牺牲，都无法在船上为女士们提供应有的设施。将军，重视女士们对满足她们个人安逸而提出的种种要求，并不是缺乏礼貌的表现，而我做的正是这点。我不愿听到女人在船上，或看到她们呆在船上。因此只要我做得到，我就不让我指挥的舰艇把一家女眷送到任何地方去。”","“But, if I know myself,” said he, “this is from no want of gallantry towards them.It is rather from feeling how impossible it is, with all one’s efforts, and all one’s sacrifices, to make the accommodations on board such as women ought to have.There can be no want of gallantry, Admiral, in rating the claims of women to every personal comfort high, and this is what I do.I hate to hear of women on board, or to see them on board; and no ship under my command shall ever convey a family of ladies anywhere, if I can help it.”"
"这么一说，他的姐姐们就向他发起进攻了。","This brought his sister upon him."
"“哎！弗雷德里克！我真不敢相信这是你说的话。全是无聊的穷讲究！女人一样舒服。在船上可以同住在最上等的住宅中一样舒服。我想我在船上呆的时间同许多妇女差不多，我觉得再也没有比军舰上更舒服了。我要明确地说，我所享受到的一切，哪怕在凯林奇的享受也罢，”（这时他友好地朝安妮点了点头），“都没有超过我乘过的大多数舰艇上所能提供的享受。而这样的舰艇一共有五艘。”","“Oh!Frederick!But I cannot believe it of you.—All idle refinement!—Women may be as comfortable on board, as in the best house in England.I believe I have lived as much on board as most women, and I know nothing superior to the accommodations of a man-of-war.I declare I have not a comfort or an indulgence about me, even at Kellynch Hall,” (with a kind bow to Anne), “beyond what I always had in most of the ships I have lived in; and they have been five altogether.”"
"“你这么讲不合适，”她的弟弟回答道，“你是同你丈夫住在一起，而且是船上唯一的女人。”","“Nothing to the purpose,” replied her brother.“You were living with your husband, and were the only woman on board.”"
"“可是你自己却把哈维尔太太、她的妹妹、表妹和三个孩子从朴茨茅斯一直送到了普利茅斯。那时，你这种体贴入微的特殊的殷勤劲儿在哪儿呢？”","“But you, yourself, brought Mrs. Harville, her sister, her cousin, and three children, round from Portsmouth to Plymouth.Where was this superfine, extraordinary sort of gallantry of yours then?”"
"“那已经完全融入我的友情中了，索菲娅。我愿尽力帮助任何一位军官弟兄的妻子。如果哈维尔需要，我会把他的任何东西从世界的另一端运过来。但是，你不要以为我不认为这么做不合适。”","“All merged in my friendship, Sophia.I would assist any brother officer’s wife that I could, and I would bring anything of Harville’s from the world’s end, if he wanted it.But do not imagine that I did not feel it an evil in itself.”"
"“放心吧，她们肯定都感到十分惬意。”","“Depend upon it, they were all perfectly comfortable.”"
"“尽管如此，我也不见得就欢迎她们。这么多妇女和孩子没有权利要求在船上过得十分舒服。”","“I might not like them the better for that perhaps.Such a number of women and children have no right to be comfortable on board.”"
"“亲爱的弗雷德里克，你这么说毫无道理。请问，要是大家都像你这样想，那我们这些可怜的水手妻子该怎么办呢？我们常常需要从一个港口到另一个港口去追随我们的丈夫。”","“My dear Frederick, you are talking quite idly.Pray, what would become of us poor sailors’ wives, who often want to be conveyed to one port or another, after our husbands, if everybody had your feelings?”"
"“你知道，我的想法并没有阻碍我将哈维尔太太及其一家送到普利茅斯啊。”","“My feelings, you see, did not prevent my taking Mrs. Harville and all her family to Plymouth.”"
"“可是，我不喜欢听你说起话来像是一个高贵的绅士，就好像女人们都是纤细柔弱的夫人小姐，而不是明白事理的普通人。我们中间谁也没有期待天天过风平浪静的生活。”","“But I hate to hear you talking so like a fine gentleman, and as if women were all fine ladies, instead of rational creatures.We none of us expect to be in smooth water all our days.”"
"“噢！亲爱的，”将军说，“等他有了妻子，他就会改变腔调的。等他结了婚，而我们又能幸运地活到另一次战争爆发。那我们就会看到他同你我以及其他许多人一样的。要是说把他的妻子送到他那里去，他会非常感激的。”","“Ah!my dear,” said the Admiral, “when he had got a wife, he will sing a different tune.When he is married, if we have the good luck to live to another war, we shall see him do as you and I, and a great many others, have done.We shall have him very thankful to anybody that will bring him his wife.”"
"“啊，那还用说。”","“Ay, that we shall.”"
"“那我就没有什么可说的了，”温特沃思上校提高嗓门说，“一旦结了婚的人攻击我说——‘喔呦！你结了婚想法就会大不相同，’我只能说，‘不，我不会的；’可是他们又说，‘会的，你一定会的，’这样一来，就谈不下去了。”","“Now I have done,” cried Captain Wentworth.“When once married people begin to attack me with,—‘Oh!you will think very differently, when you are married.’ I can only say, ‘No, I shall not;’ and then they say again, ‘Yes, you will,’ and there is an end of it.”"
"他站起身来，走开了。","He got up and moved away."
"“你一定是个了不起的旅行家，，夫人！”马斯格罗夫太太对克罗夫特太太说道。","“What a great traveller you must have been, ma’am!” said Mrs. Musgrove to Mrs. Croft."
"“结婚15年来，我确实去过很多地方，夫人。不过有很多女人比我去过的地方还多。我曾四次横渡太平洋，一次到东印度群岛，然后又返回来，不过只有一次。除了国内的某些地方外，还去了科克、里斯本和直布罗陀。但是我从来没有越过这海峡，从来没有去过西印度群岛。你知道，我们不把百慕大和巴哈马称作西印度群岛。”","“Pretty well, ma’am in the fifteen years of my marriage; though many women have done more.I have crossed the Atlantic four times, and have been once to the East Indies, and back again, and only once; besides being in different places about home: Cork, and Lisbon, and Gibraltar.But I never went beyond the Streights, and never was in the West Indies.We do not call Bermuda or Bahama, you know, the West Indies.”"
"马斯格罗夫太太说不出任何反对意见。她也不用指责自己，因为她一生中从来没有谈论到过这两个地方。","Mrs. Musgrove had not a word to say in dissent; she could not accuse herself of having ever called them anything in the whole course of her life."
"“我确实认为，夫人，”克罗夫太太接着说，“没有地方会超过军舰上的优越条件；你知道，我说的当然是高等军舰。当然，如果你乘的是一艘快速军舰，活动范围自然就有限。不过，任何一个通情达理的女人在这上面也是非常高兴的。我可以毫不夸张地说，我一生中最愉快的时光是在船上度过的。你知道，只要我们两人在一起，就没有什么可怕的。谢天谢地！我的身体幸亏一向很健康，能适应任何天气。在出海的最初24小时内总是有点不适应，但过后我从来没有晕过船。我只有一次真正感到精神不佳、身体不适，只有一次觉得自己生了病，感到有某种危险。那是我单独在迪尔过冬的时候，当时将军（那时还是克罗夫特海军上校）正在北海航行。那时，我日夜担心，不知道该怎么安排自己的生活，也不知道什么时候才能接到他的下一封信，反正总是有许多莫名其妙的抱怨。可是只要我们能在一起，我就从不生病，也从未遇到任何不便。”","“And I do assure you, ma’am,” pursued Mrs. Croft, “that nothing can exceed the accommodations of a man-of-war; I speak, you know, of the higher rates.When you come to a frigate, of course, you are more confined; though any reasonable woman may be perfectly happy in one of them; and I can safely say, that the happiest part of my life has been spent on board a ship.While we were together, you know, there was nothing to be feared.Thank God!I have always been blessed with excellent health, and no climate disagrees with me.A little disordered always the first twenty-four hours of going to sea, but never knew what sickness was afterwards.The only time I ever really suffered in body or mind, the only time that I ever fancied myself unwell, or had any ideas of danger, was the winter that I passed by myself at Deal, when the Admiral (Captain Croft then) was in the North Seas.I lived in perpetual fright at that time, and had all manner of imaginary complaints from not knowing what to do with myself, or when I should hear from him next; but as long as we could be together, nothing ever ailed me, and I never met with the smallest inconvenience.”"
"“啊，当然了。确实如此，啊，是啊！我很同意你的看法，克罗夫特太太，”马斯格罗夫太太诚恳地回答道。“没有什么比分居两地更让人不安。我很同意你的观点。我深有体会，因为马斯格罗夫先生总要去参加巡回审判。审判结束，他安全地回到家里，我总是很高兴。”","“Aye, to be sure.Yes, indeed, oh yes!I am quite of your opinion, Mrs. Croft,” was Mrs. Musgrove’s hearty answer.“There is nothing so bad as a separation.I am quite of your opinion.I know what it is, for Mr. Musgrove always attends the assizes, and I am so glad when they are over, and he is safe back again.”"
"晚宴最后以舞会结束。安妮一听到有人提出跳舞的建议，就同往常一样，表示愿意为他们效劳。她坐在钢琴旁弹奏时，眼中不时噙着泪水。她非常高兴有事情可干，但不想得到任何报答，只要不引起别人的注意就行了。","The evening ended with dancing.On its being proposed, Anne offered her services, as usual; and though her eyes would sometimes fill with tears as she sat at the instrument, she was extremely glad to be employed, and desired nothing in return but to be unobserved."
"这是一个充满欢乐与愉快的舞会，似乎没有人比温特沃思上校更兴高采烈的了。安妮觉得上校完全有理由这样高兴，因为大家都关注并尊重他，尤其是所有的年经姑娘都盯着他。几位海特小姐，就是前面提到的表亲家的姑娘们，显然已经有幸爱上他了。至于亨里埃塔和路易莎，她们的注意力似乎也全被他吸引住了。只是她们两人彼此十分要好，这才使人们不至于以为她们是势不两立的情敌。即使说人们这么普遍、这么热切的崇拜，把他宠得有点过头，那又有什么值得大惊小怪的呢？","It was a merry, joyous party, and no one seemed in higher spirits than Captain Wentworth.She felt that he had every thing to elevate him which general attention and deference, and especially the attention of all the young women, could do.The Miss Hayters, the females of the family of cousins already mentioned, were apparently admitted to the honour of being in love with him; and as for Henrietta and Louisa, they both seemed so entirely occupied by him, that nothing but the continued appearance of the most perfect good-will between themselves could have made it credible that they were not decided rivals.If he were a little spoilt by such universal, such eager admiration, who could wonder?"
"安妮的手指机械地弹着琴，弹了半个小时，既没有弹错，也没有知觉，心中只是萦绕着这些情景。有一次她感到弗雷德里克在看她，在看她那已经变了样的容颜，也许是企图找寻一度使他神魂颠倒的那张脸的残痕。有一次，她知道他一定谈起了她，而她直到听见别人的回答才意识到这点。不过她可以肯定，弗雷德里克问过他的舞伴，埃利奥特小姐是否从不跳舞？对方回答说：“啊！是的，从不跳。她完全不跳舞了。她宁愿弹琴。她对弹琴从不感到厌倦。”有一次，弗雷德里克还对安妮说了几句话。舞会结束时安妮离开了钢琴，弗雷德里克坐过去，想弹个曲调给两位马斯格罗夫小姐听听。安妮无意间走回到那里。弗雷德里克见到她，马上站起来，彬彬有礼地说：","These were some of the thoughts which occupied Anne, while her fingers were mechanically at work, proceeding for half an hour together, equally without error, and without consciousness.Once she felt that he was looking at herself, observing her altered features, perhaps, trying to trace in them the ruins of the face which had once charmed him; and once she knew that he must have spoken of her; she was hardly aware of it, till she heard the answer; but then she was sure of his having asked his partner whether Miss Elliot never danced?The answer was, “Oh, no; never; she has quite given up dancing.She had rather play.She is never tired of playing.”Once, too, he spoke to her.She had left the instrument on the dancing being over, and he had sat down to try to make out an air which he wished to give the Miss Musgroves an idea of.Unintentionally she returned to that part of the room; he saw her, and, instantly rising, said, with studied politeness—"
"“对不起，小姐，这是你的座位。”尽管她一边坚决谢绝一边往后退，他却再也不肯坐下去。","“I beg your pardon, madam, this is your seat;” and though she immediately drew back with a decided negative, he was not to be induced to sit down again."
"安妮不想再看到这样的神态，也不想再听到这样的语气。他那种冰冷的客套话和彬彬有礼的神态比什么都令人伤心。","Anne did not wish for more of such looks and speeches.His cold politeness, his ceremonious grace, were worse than anything."
"第九章","CHAPTER 9"
"温特沃思上校来到凯林奇就像回到家一样，想呆多久就可以呆多久。将军和他的妻子，对他都充满了手足之情。刚来时，他本想马上就去什罗普郡，拜访在那里定居的哥哥。但是阿珀克罗斯的吸引力使他推迟了行期。这里迎接他的是这么深厚的友谊、这么多的恭维和这么令人心醉的氛围。老人们如此好客，年轻人又是这般讨人喜欢。他只能决定留在这里，过一阵再去欣赏爱德华妻子的魅力和才华。","Captain Wentworth was come to Kellynch as to a home, to stay as long as he liked, being as thoroughly the object of the Admiral’s fraternal kindness as of his wife’s.He had intended, on first arriving, to proceed very soon into Shropshire, and visit the brother settled in that country, but the attractions of Uppercross induced him to put this off.There was so much of friendliness, and of flattery, and of everything most bewitching in his reception there; the old were so hospitable, the young so agreeable, that he could not but resolve to remain where he was, and take all the charms and perfections of Edward’s wife upon credit a little longer."
"不久，他就几乎天天跑去阿珀克罗斯。马斯格罗夫一家十分愿意邀请他，他也更愿意去，尤其是每天上午他在家里没人作伴的时候。因为这时克罗夫特夫妇通常要出门，去欣赏他们的新庄园、草地和羊群。他们的东游西荡往往令第三者难以忍受，或者是乘着新添置的双轮马车出游。","It was soon Uppercross with him almost every day.The Musgroves could hardly be more ready to invite than he to come, particularly in the morning, when he had no companion at home, for the Admiral and Mrs. Croft were generally out of doors together, interesting themselves in their new possessions, their grass, and their sheep, and dawdling about in a way not endurable to a third person, or driving out in a gig, lately added to their establishment."
"迄今为止，马斯格罗夫一家和他们的亲戚对温特沃思上校只有一个看法。那就是随时随地不变的热烈的赞赏。但是正当彼此间开始建立这种亲密关系的时候，一个叫查尔斯•海特的年轻人来到了他们中间。海特对他们的关系感到十分不安，他觉得温特沃思上校严重妨碍了他。","Hitherto there had been but one opinion of Captain Wentworth among the Musgroves and their dependencies.It was unvarying, warm admiration everywhere; but this intimate footing was not more than established, when a certain Charles Hayter returned among them, to be a good deal disturbed by it, and to think Captain Wentworth very much in the way."
"查尔斯•海特是那家表兄妹中的长兄，是一位非常和蔼令人喜爱的年轻人。温特沃思上校到来之前，亨里埃塔同查尔斯•海特之间显然颇有感情。他是位神职人员，在附近担任副牧师，但他不必住在那里，便住在父亲家里，离阿珀克罗斯只有两英里。在这关键时刻，他短期离家外出，使他的心上人失去了他的照应。他回来后痛苦地发现她的态度发生了很大的改变，并且遇见了温特沃思上校。","Charles Hayter was the eldest of all the cousins, and a very amiable, pleasing young man, between whom and Henrietta there had been a considerable appearance of attachment previous to Captain Wentworth’s introduction.He was in orders; and having a curacy in the neighbourhood, where residence was not required, lived at his father’s house, only two miles from Uppercross.A short absence from home had left his fair one unguarded by his attentions at this critical period, and when he came back he had the pain of finding very altered manners, and of seeing Captain Wentworth."
"马斯格罗夫太太和海特太太是姐妹俩。她们本来各自都有些家产，但是她们的婚姻却使各自的地位发生了重大变化。海特先生拥有自己的一些产业，但是与马斯格罗夫先生相比，则是微不足道的。马斯格罗夫家是当地社会中的上流家庭，而海特家的子女却难以入流，因为他们的父母过的是毫无光彩、半隐退的简朴生活，他们自己又没有受过很多教育。他们只不过是阿珀克罗斯的亲戚而已。当然，这位长子是个例外，他想成为学者和绅士。他的教养和风度大大超过了兄弟姐妹。","Mrs. Musgrove and Mrs. Hayter were sisters.They had each had money, but their marriages had made a material difference in their degree of consequence.Mr. Hayter had some property of his own, but it was insignificant compared with Mr. Musgrove’s; and while the Musgroves were in the first class of society in the country, the young Hayters would, from their parents’ inferior, retired, and unpolished way of living, and their own defective education, have been hardly in any class at all, but for their connexion with Uppercross, this eldest son of course excepted, who had chosen to be a scholar and a gentleman, and who was very superior in cultivation and manners to all the rest."
"这两家的关系一直很好。一方不骄傲，另一方也不嫉妒。只是两位马斯格罗夫小姐有点优越感，因此她们很愿意帮助提高表兄妹的趣味。查尔斯对亨里埃塔的殷勤早就被她的父母注意到了，不过他们并没有表示不赞成。“对于亨里埃塔来说，这桩婚姻并不是非常匹配，但是只要亨里埃塔喜欢他就行，”——而亨里埃塔看上去的确喜欢他。","The two families had always been on excellent terms, there being no pride on one side, and no envy on the other, and only such a consciousness of superiority in the Miss Musgroves, as made them pleased to improve their cousins.Charles’s attentions to Henrietta had been observed by her father and mother without any disapprobation.“It would not be a great match for her; but if Henrietta liked him,”—and Henrietta did seem to like him."
"温特沃思上校来之前，亨里埃塔自己也是完全这么想的。但是自从温特沃思上校来了之后，她就把查尔斯表兄忘掉了不少。","Henrietta fully thought so herself, before Captain Wentworth came; but from that time Cousin Charles had been very much forgotten."
"根据安妮的观察，很难说两位马斯格罗夫小姐中，温特沃思上校更喜欢哪位。或许亨里埃塔更漂亮，路易莎更活泼一点。现在，安妮已经弄不清楚，最能吸引温特沃思上校的到底是比较温和的性格还是比较活泼的性格。","Which of the two sisters was preferred by Captain Wentworth was as yet quite doubtful, as far as Anne’s observation reached.Henrietta was perhaps the prettiest, Louisa had the higher spirits; and she knew not now, whether the more gentle or the more lively character were most likely to attract him."
"马斯格罗夫夫妇也许是没有观察到什么，也许是出于对两个女儿和所有接近她们的年轻人的完全信任，以为他们都会谨言慎行，因而也有点放任自流。在老宅里，大家对这几个年轻人毫不担心，从不议论，但是在庄乡舍就不同了，这一对年轻夫妇总喜欢猜测和遐想。温特沃思上校同两位马斯格罗夫小姐才见了四五次面，查尔斯•海特刚回来，安妮就听到她妹妹和妹夫之间在议论温特沃思上校究竟更喜欢哪一位。查尔斯说是路易莎，玛丽说是亨里埃塔，不过两人都同意，不管温特沃思上校同谁结婚，都是件大好事。","Mr. and Mrs. Musgrove, either from seeing little, or from an entire confidence in the discretion of both their daughters, and of all the young men who came near them, seemed to leave everything to take its chance.There was not the smallest appearance of solicitude or remark about them in the Mansion-house; but it was different at the Cottage: the young couple there were more disposed to speculate and wonder; and Captain Wentworth had not been above four or five times in the Miss Musgroves’ company, and Charles Hayter had but just reappeared, when Anne had to listen to the opinions of her brother and sister, as to which was the one liked best.Charles gave it for Louisa, Mary for Henrietta, but quite agreeing that to have him marry either could be extremely delightful."
"查尔斯说：“我一生中还未见过比温特沃思上校更讨人喜欢的绅士，有一次他听温特沃思上校本人说起，他在战争中赚了不下两万英镑。这可是一下子就发了大财。再说，在今后的任何一次战争中他还可以如法炮制。他可以肯定，温特沃思上校很可能在海军里表现得出类拔萃。啊！不管是哪个妹妹嫁给他，都是绝妙的姻缘。”","Charles “had never seen a pleasanter man in his life; and from what he had once heard Captain Wentworth himself say, was very sure that he had not made less than twenty thousand pounds by the war.Here was a fortune at once; besides which, there would be the chance of what might be done in any future war; and he was sure Captain Wentworth was as likely a man to distinguish himself as any officer in the navy.Oh! it would be a capital match for either of his sisters.”"
"“我肯定是这样的，”玛丽回答道。“天哪！但愿他获得最高荣誉！但愿他能当上准男爵！‘温特沃思夫人’，这称呼听上去真好。对亨里埃塔来说，这确实是件了不起的事！到那时，她就会取代我的位置。亨里埃塔一定不会不喜欢的。弗雷德里克爵士和温特沃思夫人！可是这只不过是新加封的爵位，我从来都不稀罕你们那些新封的爵位。”","“Upon my word it would,” replied Mary.“Dear me!If he should rise to any very great honours!If he should ever be made a baronet!‘Lady Wentworth’ sounds very well.That would be a noble thing, indeed, for Henrietta!She would take place of me then, and Henrietta would not dislike that.Sir Frederick and Lady Wentworth!It would be but a new creation, however, and I never think much of your new creations.”"
"玛丽倾向于认为，亨里埃塔是弗雷德里克的意中人，这仅仅是因为她希望查尔斯•海特高攀的愿望最后会落空。她非常看不起海特一家，认为要是这两家人之间亲上加亲，那将是她和她儿子的一场灾难。","It suited Mary best to think Henrietta the one preferred on the very account of Charles Hayter, whose pretensions she wished to see put an end to.She looked down very decidedly upon the Hayters, and thought it would be quite a misfortune to have the existing connection between the families renewed—very sad for herself and her children."
"“你知道，”她说，“我认为查尔斯根本配不上亨里埃塔，考虑到马斯格罗夫家现有的关系，亨里埃塔没有权利随便嫁人。我认为任何年轻的姑娘都无权选择家庭主要成员不喜欢和不中意的对象，无权把一些倒霉亲戚强加在不习惯这种关系的人身上。请问，查尔斯•海特算什么？他只不过是个乡村牧师。他根本配不上阿珀克罗斯的马斯格罗夫小姐。”","“You know,” said she, “I cannot think him at all a fit match for Henrietta; and considering the alliances which the Musgroves have made, she has no right to throw herself away.I do not think any young woman has a right to make a choice that may be disagreeable and inconvenient to the principal part of her family, and be giving bad connections to those who have not been used to them.And, pray, who is Charles Hayter?Nothing but a country curate.A most improper match for Miss Musgrove of Uppercross.”"
"然而，她丈夫对此却不敢苟同，因为除了对表弟的尊重之外，查尔斯•海特也是个长子，他看问题也是从他自己长子这个角度出发的。","Her husband, however, would not agree with her here; for besides having a regard for his cousin, Charles Hayter was an eldest son, and he saw things as an eldest son himself."
"“现在你真是胡说八道，玛丽，”他因此说道，“对于亨里埃塔来说，这算不上一门上等的亲事，但是查尔斯通过斯派赛一家的关系，还是可能在一两年内从主教那儿谋得一份差使的。请你注意，他是长子，我姨夫一死，他就可以继承一大笔可观的财产。温斯罗普的庄园不下二百五十英亩，在汤顿附近还有一处农场，那里的土地是当地最好的。就算你说得对，除了查尔斯以外，他们家其他任何人都配不上亨里埃塔，确实也难以般配，只有查尔斯能配得上。他是一个脾气温和、为人正直的小伙子，一旦温思罗普传到他手里，他就会使那个地方大为改观，他的生活方式也会发生变化。只要有了那笔家产，他就再也不会遭人白眼。这是一笔完全掌握在他自己手里的地产。不，不。亨里埃塔要是不嫁给查尔斯•海特，或许会更糟糕。如果她嫁给查尔斯•海特，路易莎嫁给温特沃思上校，那我就非常满意了。”","“Now you are taking nonsense, Mary,” was therefore his answer.“It would not be a great match for Henrietta, but Charles has a very fair chance, through the Spicers, of getting something from the Bishop in the course of a year or two; and you will please to remember, that he is the eldest son; whenever my uncle dies, he steps into very pretty property.The estate at Winthrop is not less than two hundred and fifty acres, besides the farm near Taunton, which is some of the best land in the country.I grant you, that any of them but Charles would be a very shocking match for Henrietta, and indeed it could not be; he is the only one that could be possible; but he is a very good-natured, good sort of a fellow; and whenever Winthrop comes into his hands, he will make a different sort of place of it, and live in a very different sort of way; and with that property, he will never be a contemptible man—good, freehold property.No, no; Henrietta might do worse than marry Charles Hayter; and if she has him, and Louisa can get Captain Wentworth, I shall be very well satisfied.”"
"“随便查尔斯怎么说，”丈夫一走出屋子，玛丽便对安妮高声说，“可是要是亨里埃塔嫁给查尔斯•海特，那简直太可怕了。这对她不好，对我更加糟糕。因此，最好让温特沃斯上校能够尽快把查尔斯从亨里埃塔的心里赶走。我并不怀疑，温特沃斯上校已经做到了这一点。亨里埃塔昨天根本没有理会查尔斯•海特。我真希望你当时能在那儿看到她的态度。至于说什么温特沃思上校对亨里埃塔和路易莎一样喜欢，那是胡扯。因为他当然更加喜欢亨里埃塔。但是查尔斯说得这么绝对！要是昨天你跟我们在一起，你就可以对我们两个人的看法作出判断。我肯定你我会有同感，除非你有意跟我作对。”","“Charles may say what he pleases,” cried Mary to Anne, as soon as he was out of the room, “but it would be shocking to have Henrietta marry Charles Hayter; a very bad thing for her, and still worse for me; and therefore it is very much to be wished that Captain Wentworth may soon put him quite out of her head, and I have very little doubt that he has.She took hardly any notice of Charles Hayter yesterday.I wish you had been there to see her behaviour.And as to Captain Wentworth’s liking Louisa as well as Henrietta, it is nonsense to say so; for he certainly does like Henrietta a great deal the best.But Charles is so positive!I wish you had been with us yesterday, for then you might have decided between us; and I am sure you would have thought as I did, unless you had been determined to give it against me.”"
"只要到马斯格罗夫先生家去吃了那顿晚餐，安妮就可以看出一切。但是安妮借口头疼，加之小查尔斯又有点旧病复发，她就留在家里了。当时，她只想着避开温特沃思上校，现在除了度过一个清静的夜晚之外，不去还有一个优点，就是可以不给他们当仲裁。","A dinner at Mr. Musgrove’s had been the occasion when all these things should have been seen by Anne; but she had staid at home, under the mixed plea of a headache of her own, and some return of indisposition in little Charles.She had thought only of avoiding Captain Wentworth; but an escape from being appealed to as umpire was now added to the advantages of a quiet evening."
"至于温特沃思上校的态度，安妮认为，更重要的是他应该及早拿定主意，免得影响两姐妹的幸福，也不要有损于他自己的声誉，而不是他更应该喜欢亨里埃塔呢，还是路易莎。无论哪一个，都完全可能成为他忠贞而温柔的妻子。安妮很体谅查尔斯•海特的心情。对于一个心无恶意的年轻小姐的轻率行动，她感到痛心，对这种行为引起的任何痛苦深表同情。不过，即使亨里埃塔发现过去错误理解了自己的感情，现在改变了态度，那也能马上得到别人的谅解的。","As to Captain Wentworth’s views, she deemed it of more consequence that he should know his own mind early enough not to be endangering the happiness of either sister, or impeaching his own honour, than that he should prefer Henrietta to Louisa, or Louisa to Henrietta.Either of them would, in all probability, make him an affectionate, good-humoured wife.With regard to Charles Hayter, she had delicacy which must be pained by any lightness of conduct in a well-meaning young woman, and a heart to sympathize in any of the sufferings it occasioned; but if Henrietta found herself mistaken in the nature of her feelings, the alternation could not be understood too soon."
"查尔斯•海特从他表妹的言谈举止里发现了一些令他不安和伤心的迹象。亨里埃塔长期以来一直很尊重他，不可能同他彻底疏远，也不会在见过两次面之后就丧失以往的全部希望，他也不至于除了离开阿珀克罗斯之外就别无他法。但是她态度的变化是惊人的，起因可能就是温特沃思上校。查尔斯•海特仅仅离开了两个星期。分手时，他已使亨里埃塔希望他能辞掉现任的副牧师职位而转到阿珀克罗斯来，而且希望之殷切甚至同他本人一样。看来亨里埃塔当时关心的是：教区长雪莉博士四十多年来一直在满腔热情地执行着自己的全部职责，但现在已经年老体衰，对好多事情已经无能为力了。在此情况下，他应该能基本上决定聘请一位副牧师；最好在资金许可的情况下尽量以优厚薪俸聘请一位称职的副牧师，并将这一职位授予查尔斯•海特。查尔斯•海特只要到阿珀克罗斯来，不用跑六英里到别的地方去，就会获得从哪个方面来说都比较优越的副牧师职位，可以到他们尊敬的雪莉博士手下工作；亲爱善良的雪莉博士可以摆脱他的职务，目前他承担的职务极其劳累，对身体极其有害。这一切带来的好处甚至对路易莎也颇具吸引力，在亨里埃塔看来几乎是至高无上的。等查尔斯回来后，天哪！可是这两位小姐的这种热情却已全部消失。路易莎甚至根本听不进去他关于不久前和雪莉博士那次谈话的描述，她站在窗口，向外张望着，力图捕捉温特沃思上校的身影。即使是亨里埃塔，最多也只不过是心不在焉地听听而已，似乎早已忘记先前对这一谈判所抱有的疑虑和担心。","Charles Hayter had met with much to disquiet and mortify him in his cousin’s behaviour.She had too old a regard for him to be so wholly estranged as might in two meetings extinguish every past hope, and leave him nothing to do but to keep away from Uppercross: but there was such a change as became very alarming, when such a man as Captain Wentworth was to be regarded as the probable cause.He had been absent only two Sundays, and when they parted, had left her interested, even to the height of his wishes, in his prospect of soon quitting his present curacy, and obtaining that of Uppercross instead.It had then seemed the object nearest her heart, that Dr Shirley, the rector, who for more than forty years had been zealously discharging all the duties of his office, but was now growing too infirm for many of them, should be quite fixed on engaging a curate; should make his curacy quite as good as he could afford, and should give Charles Hayter the promise of it.The advantage of his having to come only to Uppercross, instead of going six miles another way; of his having, in every respect, a better curacy; of his belonging to their dear Dr Shirley, and of dear, good Dr Shirley’s being relieved from the duty which he could no longer get through without most injurious fatigue, had been a great deal, even to Louisa, but had been almost everything to Henrietta.When he came back, alas!the zeal of the business was gone by. Louisa could not listen at all to his account of a conversation which he had just held with Dr Shirley: she was at a window, looking out for Captain Wentworth; and even Henrietta had at best only a divided attention to give, and seemed to have forgotten all the former doubt and solicitude of the negotiation."
"“嗯，我很高兴，真的，我一直认为你会得到这个职位的，我一直认为你没有问题。我并不觉得——总之，你知道，雪莉博士必须有一个副牧师，而你又得到了他的许诺。他要来吗，路易莎？”","“Well, I am very glad indeed: but I always thought you would have it; I always thought you sure.It did not appear to me that—in short, you know, Dr Shirley must have a curate, and you had secured his promise.Is he coming, Louisa?”"
"一天上午，马斯格罗夫家宴请过客人不久（安妮没有参加），温特沃思上校来到乡舍的客厅，当时只有安妮和受伤的小查尔斯在客厅里，小查尔斯正躺在沙发上。","One morning, very soon after the dinner at the Musgroves, at which Anne had not been present, Captain Wentworth walked into the drawing-room at the Cottage, where were only herself and the little invalid Charles, who was lying on the sofa."
"温特沃思上校惊讶地发现自己同安妮•埃利奥特几乎单独呆在一起时，便失去了通常的沉着。他吃了一惊，只好说道，“我认为两位马斯格罗夫小姐都在这里。马斯格罗夫太太告诉我，我能在这里见到她们。”说完便走到窗口，想镇定一下，考虑一下下一步该怎么办。","The surprise of finding himself almost alone with Anne Elliot, deprived his manners of their usual composure: he started, and could only say, “I thought the Miss Musgroves had been here: Mrs. Musgrove told me I should find them here,” before he walked to the window to recollect himself, and feel how he ought to behave."
"“她们在楼上我妹妹那里。我想，她们过几分钟就会下来的。”安妮回答时自然也有些慌张，要不是小查尔斯叫她过去为他做点什么，她也许会马上走出房间，好让温特沃思上校和她自己都得到解脱。","“They are up stairs with my sister: they will be down in a few moments, I dare say,” had been Anne’s reply, in all the confusion that was natural; and if the child had not called her to come and do something for him, she would have been out of the room the next moment, and released Captain Wentworth as well as herself."
"温特沃思上校仍站在窗口，震惊而有礼貌地说了一句：“我想这孩子身体好些了吧。”接着便是一阵沉默。","He continued at the window; and after calmly and politely saying, “I hope the little boy is better,” was silent."
"安妮当时不得不跪在沙发旁安慰小查尔斯。他们就这样呆了几分钟，接着，使她大为满意的是，她听到外面有人走过那间小门厅。她转过头去，希望能看到这座房子的主人，但见到的却是难以缓和当时气氛的查尔斯•海特——他见到温特沃思上校，不见得会比温特沃思上校见到安妮更为高兴。","She was obliged to kneel down by the sofa, and remain there to satisfy her patient; and thus they continued a few minutes, when, to her very great satisfaction, she heard some other person crossing the little vestibule.She hoped, on turning her head, to see the master of the house; but it proved to be one much less calculated for making matters easy—Charles Hayter, probably not at all better pleased by the sight of Captain Wentworth than Captain Wentworth had been by the sight of Anne."
"安妮只是勉强地说了一句，“你好！请坐吧？家里人马上就下来了。”","She only attempted to say, “How do you do?Will you not sit down?The others will be here presently.”"
"可是，温特沃思上校却从窗口走了过来，看样子很想同查尔斯•海特攀谈。可是查尔斯•海特却一下子坐到桌旁，拿起了报纸，这一动作打消了温特沃思上校的念头，他又回到窗口去了。","Captain Wentworth, however, came from his window, apparently not ill-disposed for conversation; but Charles Hayter soon put an end to his attempts by seating himself near the table, and taking up the newspaper; and Captain Wentworth returned to his window."
"不一会儿，又来了一个人。这是个淘气的小胖子，年仅两岁的小男孩，他在外面让什么人给他打开了房门，大胆地来到他们中间，他径直走到沙发前，去看看哥哥他们在干些什么，看到有要得到的好东西就开口要。","Another minute brought another addition.The younger boy, a remarkable stout, forward child, of two years old, having got the door opened for him by some one without, made his determined appearance among them, and went straight to the sofa to see what was going on, and put in his claim to anything good that might be giving away."
"由于没有什么可吃的东西，他只能胡闹一阵。因为姨妈不肯让他去同受伤的哥哥捣乱，他就缠住姨妈。安妮当时正跪在地上忙着照顾查尔斯，这就使她无法甩开小胖子。她劝说他，命令他，恳求他，但怎么说都无济于事。有一次她确实设法把小胖子推开了，可是这孩子更来劲了，竟爬到她背上。","There being nothing to eat, he could only have some play; and as his aunt would not let him tease his sick brother, he began to fasten himself upon her, as she knelt, in such a way that, busy as she was about Charles, she could not shake him off.She spoke to him, ordered, entreated, and insisted in vain.Once she did contrive to push him away, but the boy had the greater pleasure in getting upon her back again directly."
"“沃尔特，”安妮说，“马上下来。你真讨厌。我生你气了。”","“Walter,” said she, “get down this moment.You are extremely troublesome.I am very angry with you.”"
"“沃尔特，”查尔斯•海特高声说，“你干嘛不听话？你没听见你姨妈的话吗？到我这儿来，沃尔特，到查尔斯表叔这儿来。”","“Walter,” cried Charles Hayter, “why do you not do as you are bid?Do not you hear your aunt speak?Come to me, Walter, come to cousin Charles.”"
"可是，沃尔特一动不动。","But not a bit did Walter stir."
"然而，过了一会儿，安妮觉得这孩子不缠着她了，因为有人把孩子从她背上抱走了。尽管这孩子把安妮的头压得很低，还是有人把他胖乎乎的小手从她脖子上掰开，硬是把孩子抱走了。这时，安妮才知道，孩子是温特沃思上校抱走的。","In another moment, however, she found herself in the state of being released from him; some one was taking him from her, though he had bent down her head so much, that his little sturdy hands were unfastened from around her neck, and he was resolutely borne away, before she knew that Captain Wentworth had done it."
"这一发现使安妮非常激动，弄得她说不出话来。她甚至无法对他表示感谢。她只能百感交集地低头照顾小查尔斯。他好意上前帮助她，他的这一番举动，自始至终都一声不响加上这种环境下的小细节，他又故意同孩子嬉闹，这一切使她很快相信，他不愿听她的道谢话，他在尽量表明他根本不愿同她谈话。安妮无法平息这种复杂而痛苦的激动心情。等到玛丽和两位马斯格罗夫小姐走进来，安妮就把小病人交给她们照料，离开了房间。她简直呆不下去了。这也许正是观察他们四个人的爱情和嫉妒表现的好机会，因为此时此刻，他们四个人正好在一起。但安妮无论如何都呆不下去了。很显然，查尔斯•海特对温特沃思上校没有好感。在温特沃思上校介入以后，查尔斯•海特曾有点生气地说，“沃尔特，你刚才就该听我的话，我叫你不要同你姨妈捣乱。”这句话给了安妮很深的印象，她能够理解查尔斯•海特遗憾的心情，因为他竟让温特沃思上校做了本该他做的事情。但是在她自己的心情稍微平静一些之前，无论是查尔斯•海特还是其他什么人的感情都引不起她的兴趣。她感到很惭愧，觉得自己这么紧张，为这么一件小事就失去常态，是很丢人的。但情况就是如此，她需要长时间的独处和思考才能恢复平静。","Her sensations on the discovery made her perfectly speechless.She could not even thank him.She could only hang over little Charles, with most disordered feelings.His kindness in stepping forward to her relief, the manner, the silence in which it had passed, the little particulars of the circumstance, with the conviction soon forced on her by the noise he was studiously making with the child, that he meant to avoid hearing her thanks, and rather sought to testify that her conversation was the last of his wants, produced such a confusion of varying, but very painful agitation, as she could not recover from, till enabled by the entrance of Mary and the Miss Musgroves to make over her little patient to their cares, and leave the room.She could not stay.It might have been an opportunity of watching the loves and jealousies of the four—they were now altogether; but she could stay for none of it.It was evident that Charles Hayter was not well inclined towards Captain Wentworth.She had a strong impression of his having said, in a vext tone of voice, after Captain Wentworth’s interference, “You ought to have minded me, Walter; I told you not to teaze your aunt;” and could comprehend his regretting that Captain Wentworth should do what he ought to have done himself.But neither Charles Hayter’s feelings, nor anybody’s feelings, could interest her, till she had a little better arranged her own.She was ashamed of herself, quite ashamed of being so nervous, so overcome by such a trifle; but so it was, and it required a long application of solitude and reflection to recover her."
"第十章","CHAPTER 10"
"安妮进行观察的机会总还会有的。不久以后，安妮就常常同那四个人呆在一起，并由此形成了自己的看法。不过她很聪明，不当着家人的面说出来。她知道，她的说法既不能使妹夫满意，也不能使妹妹满意；因为她认为路易莎虽比较得宠，但根据自己的记忆和经验判断，她还是认为温特沃思上校对谁都没有爱情。姑娘们更喜欢他，但那算不上是爱情。那只不过是一种比较强烈的倾慕而已。不过，也许他最后可能爱上其中一个。查尔斯•海特看来知道自己遭到了冷遇，可是亨里埃塔有时显得在两人之间踌躇不决。安妮真希望自己有能力向他们讲明各人的处境，指出他们所面临的某些危险。她并不认为他们中间有谁在搞阴谋诡计。她很欣慰地看到，温特沃思上校一点也没有发觉他给别人带来了痛苦。他丝毫没有得意洋洋和表现出可悲的胜利者的神气。他可能从未听说，也从未意识到查尔斯•海特有什么想法。他唯一的错误就是同时接受两个年轻姑娘的青睐（因为“接受”是个非常恰当的字眼）。","Other opportunities of making her observations could not fail to occur.Anne had soon been in company with all the four together often enough to have an opinion, though too wise to acknowledge as much at home, where she knew it would have satisfied neither husband nor wife; for while she considered Louisa to be rather the favourite, she could not but think, as far as she might dare to judge from memory and experience, that Captain Wentworth was not in love with either.They were more in love with him; yet there it was not love.It was a little fever of admiration; but it might, probably must, end in love with some.Charles Hayter seemed aware of being slighted, and yet Henrietta had sometimes the air of being divided between them.Anne longed for the power of representing to them all what they were about, and of pointing out some of the evils they were exposing themselves to.She did not attribute guile to any.It was the highest satisfaction to her to believe Captain Wentworth not in the least aware of the pain he was occasioning.There was no triumph, no pitiful triumph in his manner.He had, probably, never heard, and never thought of any claims of Charles Hayter.He was only wrong in accepting the attentions (for accepting must be the word) of two young women at once."
"然而，经过短暂的搏斗之后，查尔斯•海特似乎退出了战场。他三天没有在阿珀克罗斯露面，这是一个很明显的变化。他甚至拒绝他们一次常规晚宴的邀请。马斯格罗夫先生当场发现他面前放着好几本厚厚的书，马斯格罗夫先生和太太觉得事情肯定不妙，因此非常严肃地说，海特如此拼命看书，非累死不可。玛丽希望并相信海特遭到了亨里埃塔的明确拒绝。她丈夫则一直希望着第二天能遇见他。安妮倒觉得查尔斯•海特的行为很明智。","After a short struggle, however, Charles Hayter seemed to quit the field.Three days had passed without his coming once to Uppercross; a most decided change.He had even refused one regular invitation to dinner; and having been found on the occasion by Mr. Musgrove with some large books before him, Mr. and Mrs. Musgrove were sure all could not be right, and talked, with grave faces, of his studying himself to death.It was Mary’s hope and belief that he had received a positive dismissal from Henrietta, and her husband lived under the constant dependence of seeing him tomorrow.Anne could only feel that Charles Hayter was wise."
"就在那几天，一个上午，查尔斯•马斯格罗夫和温特沃思上校一块去打猎。安妮两姐妹俩正安静地坐在庄内干活，老宅的两姐妹到窗口来看望她们。","One morning, about this time Charles Musgrove and Captain Wentworth being gone a-shooting together, as the sisters in the Cottage were sitting quietly at work, they were visited at the window by the sisters from the Mansion-house."
"那是十一月十分晴朗的一天，马斯格罗夫小姐穿过小庭院，本想停下来说一声她们要到远处去散步，还说玛丽看来不会愿意跟她们一起去的。可是玛丽一听人家说她走不了多少路，就马上多疑地回答说：“啊，不，我很愿意和你们一起去。我很喜欢到远处散步。”一看马斯格罗夫小姐的神色，安妮就明白，她们根本不想要玛丽一起去，不过安妮又一次对这家人相处的习惯暗自钦佩。因为他们似乎形成了惯例，对任何一件事，都必须互通信息，所有的事情必须一起做，不管心中愿意不愿意，或者方便不方便。安妮设法劝阻玛丽，可是没起任何作用。这时，安妮觉得最好还是接受两位小姐对她发出的热情邀请，因为她也许能在半路上与她妹妹一起折回，从而减少对这两位小姐的安排的干扰。","It was a very fine November day, and the Miss Musgroves came through the little grounds, and stopped for no other purpose than to say, that they were going to take a long walk, and therefore concluded Mary could not like to go with them; and when Mary immediately replied, with some jealousy at not being supposed a good walker, “Oh, yes, I should like to join you very much, I am very fond of a long walk;” Anne felt persuaded, by the looks of the two girls, that it was precisely what they did not wish, and admired again the sort of necessity which the family habits seemed to produce, of everything being to be communicated, and everything being to be done together, however undesired and inconvenient.She tried to dissuade Mary from going, but in vain; and that being the case, thought it best to accept the Miss Musgroves’ much more cordial invitation to herself to go likewise, as she might be useful in turning back with her sister, and lessening the interference in any plan of their own."
"“真想不到她们会以为我不喜欢到远处散步，”玛丽在上楼时说，“人们总以为我走不了长路，要是我们拒绝跟她们一块去，她们会不高兴的。别人那么盛情邀请我们，怎么能说不呢？”","“I cannot imagine why they should suppose I should not like a long walk,” said Mary, as she went up stairs.“Everybody is always supposing that I am not a good walker; and yet they would not have been pleased, if we had refused to join them.When people come in this manner on purpose to ask us, how can one say no?”"
"她们正要出发，两位绅士回来了。他们刚才带了一条小狗出去，这条狗败坏了他们打猎的兴致，所以他们早早就回来了。他们正好有时间、有精力，也有情绪一起散步，就高兴地参与这一活动。安妮要是能预见到这一遭遇，她就会选择留在家里了。但是出于某种关心和好奇，她觉得现在表示不去也为时太晚了。于是他们六人就一起朝着两位马斯格罗夫小姐选择的方向走去。这两位小姐显然认为，这次散步应由她们来向导。","Just as they were setting off, the gentlemen returned.They had taken out a young dog, who had spoilt their sport, and sent them back early.Their time and strength, and spirits, were, therefore, exactly ready for this walk, and they entered into it with pleasure.Could Anne have foreseen such a junction, she would have staid at home; but, from some feelings of interest and curiosity, she fancied now that it was too late to retract, and the whole six set forward together in the direction chosen by the Miss Musgroves, who evidently considered the walk as under their guidance."
"安妮的目的是不妨碍别人。因此，每当田间小路要把人们分开时，她总是同妹妹和妹夫走在一起。安妮在散步中获得的乐趣不外乎活动一下肢体和享受一下晴朗的天气。她欣赏着洒落在黄树叶和枯树篱上的那一抹晚秋的阳光，反复默诵着几首那成千成百的描写秋色的诗句。秋天是对富有情趣和感情细腻的人产生奇异而又无穷的感染力的季节。秋天，任何一位值得一读的诗人都会受其吸引，努力做一些描述或写几行抒发感受的诗句。安妮尽量把自己的思路引到这上面去，背诵这些诗句；但是在能够听到温特沃思上校同两位马斯格罗夫小姐的谈话时，她却不能不去倾听。不过，她没听到什么特别的内容。他们只是谈得比较起劲罢了。任何关系密切的年轻人都可能进行这样的谈话。上校同路易莎谈得比同亨里埃塔的多。路易莎当然比姐姐更活跃，想以此赢得上校的青睐。这种差别似乎在加深，路易莎有一段话引起了安妮的注意。他们总要不时地说出几句赞美天气的话，一次赞美完天气后，温特沃思上校接着说道：","Anne’s object was, not to be in the way of anybody; and where the narrow paths across the fields made many separations necessary, to keep with her brother and sister.Her pleasure in the walk must arise from the exercise and the day, from the view of the last smiles of the year upon the tawny leaves, and withered hedges, and from repeating to herself some few of the thousand poetical descriptions extant of autumn, that season of peculiar and inexhaustible influence on the mind of taste and tenderness, that season which had drawn from every poet, worthy of being read, some attempt at description, or some lines of feeling.She occupied her mind as much as possible in such like musings and quotations; but it was not possible, that when within reach of Captain Wentworth’s conversation with either of the Miss Musgroves, she should not try to hear it; yet she caught little very remarkable.It was mere lively chat, such as any young persons, on an intimate footing, might fall into.He was more engaged with Louisa than with Henrietta.Louisa certainly put more forward for his notice than her sister.This distinction appeared to increase, and there was one speech of Louisa’s which struck her.After one of the many praises of the day, which were continually bursting forth, Captain Wentworth added:—"
"“这天气对于将军和我姐姐来说，真是太棒了！今天上午他们准备乘车去兜个大圈子，也许我们还可以在某个山顶向他们打招呼呢。他们说过要到这一带来的。我不知道今天他们会在哪里翻车。啊！我实话跟你说吧，这种情况经常发生。不过我姐姐毫不在乎，她倒宁愿从车子里颠出来。”","“What glorious weather for the Admiral and my sister!They meant to take a long drive this morning; perhaps we may hail them from some of these hills.They talked of coming into this side of the country.I wonder whereabouts they will upset today.Oh! it does happen very often, I assure you; but my sister makes nothing of it; she would as lieve be tossed out as not.”"
"“啊！我知道你有些夸大其词，”路易莎高声说，“不过如果情况确实如此，要是我处在她的地位，我也会这么做。如果我爱一个男人，就像她爱将军那样，我会一辈子跟他在一起，什么力量也不能把我们分开。我宁愿他把我从车里翻出去，也不愿意让别人为我安全地驾车。”","“Ah! you make the most of it, I know,” cried Louisa, “but if it were really so, I should do just the same in her place.If I loved a man, as she loves the Admiral, I would always be with him, nothing should ever separate us, and I would rather be overturned by him, than driven safely by anybody else.”"
"她兴致勃勃地说着。","It was spoken with enthusiasm."
"“是吗？”温特沃思上校用同样的语调说道，“我真佩服你！”说完，两人都沉默了一小会儿。","“Had you?” cried he, catching the same tone; “I honour you!”And there was silence between them for a little while."
"安妮无法马上再开始背诵诗文。她暂时忘却了这秋天的美景，脑海只有一首优美的十四行诗，它与晚秋的情调十分相似，充满着逐渐消逝的欢乐，青春、希望和春天的形象全都消失了。在他们服从走另一条小路时，安妮才勉强回过神来说，“这条路是通向温思罗普的吧？”但没人听见，或者至少没人回答。","Anne could not immediately fall into a quotation again.The sweet scenes of autumn were for a while put by, unless some tender sonnet, fraught with the apt analogy of the declining year, with declining happiness, and the images of youth and hope, and spring, all gone together, blessed her memory.She roused herself to say, as they struck by order into another path, “Is not this one of the ways to Winthrop?”But nobody heard, or, at least, nobody answered her."
"不过，这次他们正是要去温思罗普或与它毗邻的地区——因为有时可以遇见一些年轻人在住宅附近散步。他们经过一片片广阔的圈地，农夫正在那里耕作，新铺的小路是他们辛劳的果实，这意味着春天又会到来，这一切淡化了人们甜蜜而沮丧的诗意。就这样，他们沿着慢坡又往上走了半英里，来到一座高高的小山顶上。这是阿珀克罗斯和温斯罗普间的分界线。不一会儿就看到了另一边山脚下的温思罗普的全景。","Winthrop, however, or its environs—for young men are, sometimes to be met with, strolling about near home—was their destination; and after another half mile of gradual ascent through large enclosures, where the ploughs at work, and the fresh made path spoke the farmer counteracting the sweets of poetical despondence, and meaning to have spring again, they gained the summit of the most considerable hill, which parted Uppercross and Winthrop, and soon commanded a full view of the latter, at the foot of the hill on the other side."
"温思斯罗普展现在他们眼前，既不美丽也不庄严。一幢普通而矮小的农舍，四周是谷仓和农场建筑物。","Winthrop, without beauty and without dignity, was stretched before them an indifferent house, standing low, and hemmed in by the barns and buildings of a farm-yard."
"玛丽惊呼道：“天哪！到温思罗普了。我刚才一点也不知道！好了，我想我们最好现在往回走。我累坏了。”","Mary exclaimed, “Bless me!here is Winthrop.I declare I had no idea!Well now, I think we had better turn back; I am excessively tired.”"
"亨里埃塔有点不好意思，有点惭愧。她没有看见查尔斯表哥在哪一条小路上散步，或倚立在哪一扇大门前，所以准备按照玛丽的意见行事。但是查尔斯•马斯格罗夫却说：“不！”路易莎喊得更起劲：“不，不！”她把亨里埃塔拉到一旁，激动地同她争论着什么。","Henrietta, conscious and ashamed, and seeing no cousin Charles walking along any path, or leaning against any gate, was ready to do as Mary wished; but “No!” said Charles Musgrove, and “No, no!” cried Louisa more eagerly, and taking her sister aside, seemed to be arguing the matter warmly."
"这时，查尔斯断然表示，既然已近在眼前，他一定要去看望一下姨妈。他显然想说服妻子与他同行，只是心中没把握。然而，这正是那位太太显示力量的地方。查尔斯说，既然玛丽感到很累，不如去温斯罗普休息半个小时。玛丽却坚决地回答：“啊，不，决不！再爬上这座山给我带来的害处比去山下坐坐带来的好处要多。”总之，她的神气和态度表明，她是不会去的。","Charles, in the meanwhile, was very decidedly declaring his resolution of calling on his aunt, now that he was so near; and very evidently, though more fearfully, trying to induce his wife to go too. But this was one of the points on which the lady shewed her strength; and when he recommended the advantage of resting herself a quarter of an hour at Winthrop, as she felt so tired, she resolutely answered, “Oh!no, indeed!walking up that hill again would do her more harm than any sitting down could do her good;” and, in short, her look and manner declared, that go she would not."
"经过这样一阵辩论和商讨之后，查尔斯和他的两个妹妹之间达成了协议。查尔斯和亨里埃塔只是跑下去一会儿，看看姨妈和表兄妹，其他人就在山顶上等他们。看来，路易莎是这一主张的主要策划者，她陪他们在山下走了一小段路，边走还边同亨里埃塔谈着，玛丽趁机轻蔑地朝四周看看，对温特沃思上校说：","After a little succession of these sort of debates and consultations, it was settled between Charles and his two sisters, that he and Henrietta should just run down for a few minutes, to see their aunt and cousins, while the rest of the party waited for them at the top of the hill.Louisa seemed the principal arranger of the plan; and, as she went a little way with them, down the hill, still talking to Henrietta, Mary took the opportunity of looking scornfully around her, and saying to Captain Wentworth—"
"“有这样的亲戚真不愉快！不过，我可以告诉你，我一生中到那屋里去过的次数不超过两次。”","“It is very unpleasant, having such connexions!But, I assure you, I have never been in the house above twice in my life.”"
"她没有听到任何回答。对方只不过勉强笑了笑，表示赞同，然后转身走开时给出了轻蔑的一笑。安妮心里完全明白温特沃思上校这一举动的意思。","She received no other answer, than an artificial, assenting smile, followed by a contemptuous glance, as he turned away, which Anne perfectly knew the meaning of."
"他们登上的那个山顶真是令人赏心悦目的地方。路易莎回来了，玛丽在围栏的梯级上找了个舒服的地方一坐，看到大家在她的周围，感到非常满意。但是路易莎拉着温特沃思上校跑到附近树篱旁边去拾坚果去了。他们越走越远，连人影也看不见，声音也听不到了，这时玛丽就不高兴了。她觉得自己的座位很不舒服，确定路易莎一定在哪儿找到了比这更好的地方。她怎么说也要换个更好的地方。她穿过那扇大门，可是没有看到他们两人的影子。安妮在树篱下有阳光的干燥斜坡上为玛丽找到了一个好地方，她肯定路易莎他们就在附近。玛丽坐了一会儿还是觉得不舒服，她肯定路易莎在别的什么地方找到了更好的位子，她要继续往前走，直到追上路易莎。","The brow of the hill, where they remained, was a cheerful spot: Louisa returned; and Mary, finding a comfortable seat for herself on the step of a stile, was very well satisfied so long as the others all stood about her; but when Louisa drew Captain Wentworth away, to try for a gleaning of nuts in an adjoining hedge-row, and they were gone by degrees quite out of sight and sound, Mary was happy no longer; she quarrelled with her own seat, was sure Louisa had got a much better somewhere, and nothing could prevent her from going to look for a better also.She turned through the same gate, but could not see them.Anne found a nice seat for her, on a dry sunny bank, under the hedge-row, in which she had no doubt of their still being, in some spot or other.Mary sat down for a moment, but it would not do; she was sure Louisa had found a better seat somewhere else, and she would go on till she overtook her."
"安妮累极了，她很高兴能有个好地方坐下来。不一会儿她就听见温特沃思上校和路易莎的声音，他们就在她身后的树篱下往回走，好像正走在高低不平、杂乱的沟渠中。他们边说边走过来。她首先分辨出了路易莎的声音。她似乎正在起劲地谈论着什么。安妮最初听到的是：","Anne, really tired herself, was glad to sit down; and she very soon heard Captain Wentworth and Louisa in the hedge-row, behind her, as if making their way back along the rough, wild sort of channel, down the centre.They were speaking as they drew near.Louisa’s voice was the first distinguished.She seemed to be in the middle of some eager speech.What Anne first heard was—"
"“就这样，我劝她去了。我不能忍受几句胡言乱语就阻止她去进行这次拜访。什么！凭什么一个人或者别的什么人的装腔作势和干预，就能让我放弃我决心要干的明知是正确的事情？不，我不会这么容易屈服。我要是下定决心，那就不容改变。今天亨里埃塔本来好像是拿定了主意要去温思罗普的，可是她为了荒唐地讨好别人，差一点放弃了这个念头！”","“And so, I made her go.I could not bear that she should be frightened from the visit by such nonsense.What! would I be turned back from doing a thing that I had determined to do, and that I knew to be right, by the airs and interference of such a person, or of any person I may say?No, I have no idea of being so easily persuaded.When I have made up my mind, I have made it; and Henrietta seemed entirely to have made up hers to call at Winthrop to-day; and yet, she was as near giving it up, out of nonsensical complaisance!”"
"“那么说，要不是你，她不会回去的？”","“She would have turned back then, but for you?”"
"“她真会这么做。说出来我都到觉得有点丢人。”","“She would indeed.I am almost ashamed to say it.”"
"“她真幸运！身旁有你这么一个人出主意。你刚才的意见肯定了我上次遇到查尔斯•海特时观察的结果，我没有必要装作视而不见。看来，这不仅仅是对你姨妈的一次简单的礼节性拜访。亨里埃塔要是没有足够的决心去克服对这种小事的无聊干预，那么在他俩面临重大抉择和坚韧毅力的时候，查尔斯就会陷入苦恼，亨里埃塔也一样。你姐姐是个亲切的人，可是我看得出来，你的性格果断而坚定。你要是关心她的行为和幸福，那就尽量用你的精神去感染她吧。不过，你无疑一直是这么做的。过分驯服和犹豫的性格最糟糕的一点，就是人们没有把握是否能对之施加影响。你永远无法肯定，一种良好印象是否能够持久不衰，任何人都可以改变这种印象。但愿那些希望得到幸福的人都能意志坚定。这里有一个榛子，”说着，便从一根较高的树枝上摘下了一颗。“举例说吧：这是一个光洁好看的坚果，由于大自然赋予的力量，它经受住了秋天的风风雨雨。一点裂痕或缺陷都没有。”他以一种严肃的幽默感继续说道，“其他许许多多同样的坚果都落在地上，遭人践踏，而这颗却仍然享有一颗榛子所能享受的全部乐趣。”然后他又回到刚才那种诚恳的语气：“我对我所关心的一切人抱有最大的希望，就是他们必须意志坚定。如果路易莎•马斯格罗夫在晚年还是这么漂亮，这么快乐，到时候她一定会珍惜她今天的毅力。”","“Happy for her, to have such a mind as yours at hand!After the hints you gave just now, which did but confirm my own observations, the last time I was in company with him, I need not affect to have no comprehension of what is going on.I see that more than a mere dutiful morning visit to your aunt was in question; and woe betide him, and her too, when it comes to things of consequence, when they are placed in circumstances requiring fortitude and strength of mind, if she have not resolution enough to resist idle interference in such a trifle as this.Your sister is an amiable creature; but yours is the character of decision and firmness, I see.If you value her conduct or happiness, infuse as much of your own spirit into her as you can.But this, no doubt, you have been always doing.It is the worst evil of too yielding and indecisive a character, that no influence over it can be depended on.You are never sure of a good impression being durable; everybody may sway it.Let those who would be happy be firm.Here is a nut,” said he, catching one down from an upper bough.“to exemplify: a beautiful glossy nut, which, blessed with original strength, has outlived all the storms of autumn.Not a puncture, not a weak spot anywhere.This nut,” he continued, with playful solemnity, “while so many of his brethren have fallen and been trodden under foot, is still in possession of all the happiness that a hazel nut can be supposed capable of.”Then returning to his former earnest tone—“My first wish for all whom I am interested in, is that they should be firm.If Louisa Musgrove would be beautiful and happy in her November of life, she will cherish all her present powers of mind.”"
"他的话说完了，不过没有得到回答。要是路易莎当时对这样的谈话作出回答，安妮一定会感到惊讶。这番话语如此关切，说得又是如此严肃而热诚！她想象得出路易莎当时的感受。对于她自己来说，她不敢动弹，怕一动就会被发现。她继续呆在遮着她的一丛蔓生的矮冬青下，而那两个人则继续向前走去。不过，他们还没有走到安妮听不见的地方，路易莎又开口了。","He had done, and was unanswered.It would have surprised Anne if Louisa could have readily answered such a speech: words of such interest, spoken with such serious warmth!She could imagine what Louisa was feeling.For herself, she feared to move, lest she should be seen.While she remained, a bush of low rambling holly protected her, and they were moving on.Before they were beyond her hearing, however, Louisa spoke again."
"“在好多方面，玛丽的脾气是够温和的，”路易莎说，“不过，她莫名其妙的言行和傲气——埃利奥特家的傲气，有时使我十分生气。她身上埃利奥特家的傲气太盛了。所以我们都希望当时查尔斯能够娶安妮。我想，你知道他是想娶安妮的吧？”","“Mary is good-natured enough in many respects,” said she; “but she does sometimes provoke me excessively, by her nonsense and pride—the Elliot pride.She has a great deal too much of the Elliot pride.We do so wish that Charles had married Anne instead.I suppose you know he wanted to marry Anne?”"
"停了一会儿，温特沃思上校说：","After a moment’s pause, Captain Wentworth said—"
"“你的意思是，安妮拒绝了查尔斯？”","“Do you mean that she refused him?”"
"“对！是的，当然了。”","“Oh!yes; certainly.”"
"“这是在什么时候？”","“When did that happen?”"
"“我不知道确切的时间，因为当时我和亨里埃塔正住在学校里。不过我想大约是在他娶玛丽前一年。我真希望安妮当时能答应他的求婚。要是换成她，我们大家就会喜欢多了。爸爸和妈妈总是以为是她的好朋友拉塞尔夫人从中作梗，她才没有答应。他们觉得，大概是查尔斯的学问不够，书读得少，无法使拉塞尔夫人满意，所以她就劝安妮拒绝了查尔斯。”","“I do not exactly know, for Henrietta and I were at school at the time; but I believe about a year before he married Mary.I wish she had accepted him.We should all have liked her a great deal better; and papa and mamma always think it was her great friend Lady Russell’s doing, that she did not.They think Charles might not be learned and bookish enough to please Lady Russell, and that therefore, she persuaded Anne to refuse him.”"
"他们的说话声渐渐远去，安妮再也听不见了。她自己的激动心情却一直把她钉在那里。她要好好镇定下来才能动弹。她的命运同偷听者通常的命运并不完全一样。她没有听到别人讲她坏话，但是她听到了许多令人痛苦的重要内容。她看出了温特沃思上校怎样看待她的性格，而上校对她的关心和好奇程度自然引起了她极大的不安。","The sounds were retreating, and Anne distinguished no more.Her own emotions still kept her fixed.She had much to recover from, before she could move.The listener’s proverbial fate was not absolutely hers; she had heard no evil of herself, but she had heard a great deal of very painful import.She saw how her own character was considered by Captain Wentworth, and there had been just that degree of feeling and curiosity about her in his manner which must give her extreme agitation."
"她刚把自己的情感压抑下来，就去找玛丽，找到后就同她一起回到她们原来呆过的围栏梯级附近。一会儿，大家都到齐了，再次一起上路，这使安妮感到欣慰。她的情绪需要孤独和沉默，而只有人多才能提供这种可能。","As soon as she could, she went after Mary, and having found, and walked back with her to their former station, by the stile, felt some comfort in their whole party being immediately afterwards collected, and once more in motion together.Her spirits wanted the solitude and silence which only numbers could give."
"不出所料，查尔斯和亨里埃塔回来时带上了查尔斯•海特。安妮不能了解事情的细节。在这方面，似乎温特沃思上校也不能说是十分清楚。但是毫无疑问，查尔斯•海特退出后，亨里埃塔心软了，现在他们又能很高兴地呆在一起了。亨里埃塔显得有点不好意思，但是十分愉快，查尔斯•海特尤为兴奋。而且当大家一开始反身向阿珀克罗斯出发时，他们两人就几乎一直呆在一起。","Charles and Henrietta returned, bringing, as may be conjectured, Charles Hayter with them.The minutiae of the business Anne could not attempt to understand; even Captain Wentworth did not seem admitted to perfect confidence here; but that there had been a withdrawing on the gentleman’s side, and a relenting on the lady’s, and that they were now very glad to be together again, did not admit a doubt.Henrietta looked a little ashamed, but very well pleased;—Charles Hayter exceedingly happy: and they were devoted to each other almost from the first instant of their all setting forward for Uppercross."
"现在一切都表明，温特沃思上校会选择路易莎。事情再清楚不过了。无论大家需要分开走，还是不需要分开走，他们俩几乎总是走在一起，就像另外一对一样。当走过绵延的牧场时，尽管大家有充足的空间，他们却明显地分为三组。而安妮当然属于最不活跃、最不热乎的三人小组。她同查尔斯和玛丽走在一起，感到很累，所以很高兴查尔斯能一手挽着玛丽，一手挽着她。可是查尔斯虽然对她很温和，对他的妻子却颇为恼火。刚才玛丽一点都不为他着想，现在可要自食其果了。查尔斯几乎随时都会放开玛丽的胳膊，用树枝去抽打树篱中某些荨麻的梢头。玛丽便开始埋怨起来，为自己受到亏待而伤心，当然还是老一套，说自己走在树篱这边受了委屈，而走在另一边的安妮却没有这样的麻烦，于是查尔斯索性放开两人的胳膊去追逐一只一闪而过的黄鼬，而她们几乎没法跟上他的步伐。","Everything now marked out Louisa for Captain Wentworth; nothing could be plainer; and where many divisions were necessary, or even where they were not, they walked side by side nearly as much as the other two.In a long strip of meadow land, where there was ample space for all, they were thus divided, forming three distinct parties; and to that party of the three which boasted least animation, and least complaisance, Anne necessarily belonged.She joined Charles and Mary, and was tired enough to be very glad of Charles’s other arm; but Charles, though in very good humour with her, was out of temper with his wife.Mary had shewn herself disobliging to him, and was now to reap the consequence, which consequence was his dropping her arm almost every moment to cut off the heads of some nettles in the hedge with his switch; and when Mary began to complain of it, and lament her being ill-used, according to custom, in being on the hedge side, while Anne was never incommoded on the other, he dropped the arms of both to hunt after a weasel which he had a momentary glance of, and they could hardly get him along at all."
"挨着这一片长长的牧场有一条小路，他们所走的这条草路的尽头便与这条小路相交。当他们刚走到出口处的大门时，向同一方向前进的一辆马车也刚好驶来。原来，他们早就听出是克罗夫特将军的双轮马车。他和妻子按照原来的打算兜完了风，现在正要回家。他们听说这些年轻人走了这么长的路，便亲切地提议让一位感到特别疲劳的女士上车，这样她可以少走整整一英里，因为他们要路过阿珀克罗斯。这个邀请是对所有人发出的，但是大家都拒绝了。两位马斯格罗夫小姐根本不觉得累。玛丽或许是因为没有先邀请她而生气，或许是因为路易莎所说的埃利奥特家族的傲气，使她无法忍受在一辆单马马车中充当第三者。","This long meadow bordered a lane, which their footpath, at the end of it was to cross, and when the party had all reached the gate of exit, the carriage advancing in the same direction, which had been some time heard, was just coming up, and proved to be Admiral Croft’s gig.He and his wife had taken their intended drive, and were returning home.Upon hearing how long a walk the young people had engaged in, they kindly offered a seat to any lady who might be particularly tired; it would save her a full mile, and they were going through Uppercross.The invitation was general, and generally declined.The Miss Musgroves were not at all tired, and Mary was either offended, by not being asked before any of the others, or what Louisa called the Elliot pride could not endure to make a third in a one horse chaise."
"散步的人群穿过了小路，正要登上对面的围栏梯级，而将军也正要催马前进了。这时温特沃思上校迅速地穿过树篱，对他姐姐说了些什么。但根据事后的效果来看，可以猜出他说话的内容。","The walking party had crossed the lane, and were surmounting an opposite stile, and the Admiral was putting his horse in motion again, when Captain Wentworth cleared the hedge in a moment to say something to his sister.The something might be guessed by its effects."
"“埃利奥特小姐，我想你一定累了，”克罗夫特太太喊道。“请一定赏光让我们送你回去。你放心好了，车上坐三个人是很舒服的。要是我们都像你一样的身材，我想我们也许可以坐下四个人。你来吧，真的，你一定要来。”","“Miss Elliot, I am sure you are tired,” cried Mrs. Croft.“Do let us have the pleasure of taking you home.Here is excellent room for three, I assure you.If we were all like you, I believe we might sit four.You must, indeed, you must.”"
"安妮仍站在小路上，尽管她开始本能地表示谢绝，可是话给打断了。将军也支持他妻子的邀请，一再加以善意地敦促，所以安妮很难拒绝他们了。他们尽可能地缩在一边，给她让出一个角落，温特沃思上校则默默地转过身去，扶她上了车。","Anne was still in the lane; and though instinctively beginning to decline, she was not allowed to proceed.The Admiral’s kind urgency came in support of his wife’s; they would not be refused; they compressed themselves into the smallest possible space to leave her a corner, and Captain Wentworth, without saying a word, turned to her, and quietly obliged her to be assisted into the carriage."
"是的，他这么做了。安妮登上了马车，她觉得这是温特沃思上校让她坐上去的，是他的意志和双手让她坐上去的。她应该感激他，是他发现了她的倦容，并决心让她休息一会儿。这一切都清楚地表明了上校对她的态度，安妮为此深受感动。这一小小的插曲似乎为先前所发生的一切画上了圆满的句号。她明白他的心意。他不能原谅她，但对她还不能冷酷无情。为了那段往事，他怪罪她，内心充满了不公正的满腔怨恨。虽然他对她已经无所谓，开始追求别人，但是他不能眼看着她难受而不去帮助她减轻痛苦。这是旧情依稀。这是纯洁而尚未被自己确认的友情的冲动。这表明他的心灵热情而又美好。安妮意识到这一点，心中既高兴，又痛苦，连自己也不知道究竟是哪种感情占着上风。","Yes; he had done it.She was in the carriage, and felt that he had placed her there, that his will and his hands had done it, that she owed it to his perception of her fatigue, and his resolution to give her rest.She was very much affected by the view of his disposition towards her, which all these things made apparent.This little circumstance seemed the completion of all that had gone before.She understood him.He could not forgive her, but he could not be unfeeling.Though condemning her for the past, and considering it with high and unjust resentment, though perfectly careless of her, and though becoming attached to another, still he could not see her suffer, without the desire of giving her relief.It was a remainder of former sentiment; it was an impulse of pure, though unacknowledged friendship; it was a proof of his own warm and amiable heart, which she could not contemplate without emotions so compounded of pleasure and pain, that she knew not which prevailed."
"起初，安妮只是心不在焉地答谢两个同车人的好意和关心。马车在崎岖的小路上走了一半路，安妮才清醒地听到他们在说些什么。这时，她才发现他们在谈论“弗雷德里克”。","Her answers to the kindness and the remarks of her companions were at first unconsciously given.They had travelled half their way along the rough lane, before she was quite awake to what they said.She then found them talking of “Frederick.”"
"“他当然是打算在那两个姑娘中挑一个做妻子，索菲，”将军说，“但是还说不准是哪一个。人们会认为，他对这两位姑娘追得够久了。哎，这都是因为是在和平时期。要是在战时，他早就选定了。埃利奥特小姐，我们这些海员在战争时期是无法长时期追求一位姑娘的。亲爱的，从我第一次见到你，到我们在北雅茅斯的住房中结为夫妻，中间一共是多少天来着？”","“He certainly means to have one or other of those two girls, Sophy,” said the Admiral; “but there is no saying which.He has been running after them, too, long enough, one would think, to make up his mind.Ay, this comes of the peace.If it were war now, he would have settled it long ago.We sailors, Miss Elliot, cannot afford to make long courtships in time of war.How many days was it, my dear, between the first time of my seeing you and our sitting down together in our lodgings at North Yarmouth?”"
"“亲爱的，我们最好别谈这事，”克罗夫特太太高兴地回答道，“要是埃利奥特小姐听说我们在那么短的时间内就彼此心心相印了，她永远也不会相信我们在一起会幸福。不过，我早就知道你的性格。”","“We had better not talk about it, my dear,” replied Mrs. Croft, pleasantly; “for if Miss Elliot were to hear how soon we came to an understanding, she would never be persuaded that we could be happy together.I had known you by character, however, long before.”"
"“是的，我也早就听说你是一个非常漂亮的姑娘，那我们还要等什么呢？这种事我不喜欢拖得太久。我希望弗雷德里克能够加快速度，把这两个小姐中的一个带到凯林奇来。那时我们可以经常同他们做伴。再说，这两位小姐人都不错，我都很难把两人分清楚。”","“Well, and I had heard of you as a very pretty girl, and what were we to wait for besides?I do not like having such things so long in hand.I wish Frederick would spread a little more canvass, and bring us home one of these young ladies to Kellynch.Then there would always be company for them.And very nice young ladies they both are; I hardly know one from the other.”"
"“真是两个温柔而大方的姑娘，”克罗夫特太太赞美的语气不强烈，因而安妮觉得克罗夫特太太看问题更尖锐，也许认为这两姐妹都配不上她弟弟。“家庭也很正派。他能结成这门亲事是再好不过的了。我亲爱的将军，那儿有根柱子！我们非得撞到那根柱子上不可。”","“Very good humoured, unaffected girls, indeed,” said Mrs. Croft, in a tone of calmer praise, such as made Anne suspect that her keener powers might not consider either of them as quite worthy of her brother; “and a very respectable family.One could not be connected with better people.My dear Admiral, that post!we shall certainly take that post.”"
"不过，她镇静地往旁边一拽缰绳，大家便幸运地脱险了。后来，她又一次小心地扬了扬手，于是马车既没有滑进车辙，也没有撞上粪车。安妮觉得他们两位驾车的方法很有趣，于是猜想这应该是他们平时处理各种事务的不错的例子。就这样，他们安全地把安妮送到了乡舍。","But by coolly giving the reins a better direction herself they happily passed the danger; and by once afterwards judiciously putting out her hand they neither fell into a rut, nor ran foul of a dung-cart; and Anne, with some amusement at their style of driving, which she imagined no bad representation of the general guidance of their affairs, found herself safely deposited by them at the Cottage."
"","CHAPTER 11"
"","The time now approached for Lady Russell’s return: the day was even fixed; and Anne, being engaged to join her as soon as she was resettled, was looking forward to an early removal to Kellynch, and beginning to think how her own comfort was likely to be affected by it."
"","It would place her in the same village with Captain Wentworth, within half a mile of him; they would have to frequent the same church, and there must be intercourse between the two families.This was against her; but on the other hand, he spent so much of his time at Uppercross, that in removing thence she might be considered rather as leaving him behind, than as going towards him; and, upon the whole, she believed she must, on this interesting question, be the gainer, almost as certainly as in her change of domestic society, in leaving poor Mary for Lady Russell."
"","She wished it might be possible for her to avoid ever seeing Captain Wentworth at the Hall: those rooms had witnessed former meetings which would be brought too painfully before her; but she was yet more anxious for the possibility of Lady Russell and Captain Wentworth never meeting anywhere.They did not like each other, and no renewal of acquaintance now could do any good; and were Lady Russell to see them together, she might think that he had too much self-possession, and she too little."
"","These points formed her chief solicitude in anticipating her removal from Uppercross, where she felt she had been stationed quite long enough.Her usefulness to little Charles would always give some sweetness to the memory of her two months’ visit there, but he was gaining strength apace, and she had nothing else to stay for."
"","The conclusion of her visit, however, was diversified in a way which she had not at all imagined.Captain Wentworth, after being unseen and unheard of at Uppercross for two whole days, appeared again among them to justify himself by a relation of what had kept him away."
"","A letter from his friend, Captain Harville, having found him out at last, had brought intelligence of Captain Harville’s being settled with his family at Lyme for the winter; of their being therefore, quite unknowingly, within twenty miles of each other.Captain Harville had never been in good health since a severe wound which he received two years before, and Captain Wentworth’s anxiety to see him had determined him to go immediately to Lyme.He had been there for four-and-twenty hours.His acquittal was complete, his friendship warmly honoured, a lively interest excited for his friend, and his description of the fine country about Lyme so feelingly attended to by the party, that an earnest desire to see Lyme themselves, and a project for going thither was the consequence."
"","The young people were all wild to see Lyme.Captain Wentworth talked of going there again himself, it was only seventeen miles from Uppercross; though November, the weather was by no means bad; and, in short, Louisa, who was the most eager of the eager, having formed the resolution to go, and besides the pleasure of doing as she liked, being now armed with the idea of merit in maintaining her own way, bore down all the wishes of her father and mother for putting it off till summer; and to Lyme they were to go—Charles, Mary, Anne, Henrietta, Louisa, and Captain Wentworth."
"","The first heedless scheme had been to go in the morning and return at night; but to this Mr. Musgrove, for the sake of his horses, would not consent; and when it came to be rationally considered, a day in the middle of November would not leave much time for seeing a new place, after deducting seven hours, as the nature of the country required, for going and returning.They were, consequently, to stay the night there, and not to be expected back till the next day’s dinner.This was felt to be a considerable amendment; and though they all met at the Great House at rather an early breakfast hour, and set off very punctually, it was so much past noon before the two carriages, Mr. Musgrove’s coach containing the four ladies, and Charles’s curricle, in which he drove Captain Wentworth, were descending the long hill into Lyme, and entering upon the still steeper street of the town itself, that it was very evident they would not have more than time for looking about them, before the light and warmth of the day were gone."
"","After securing accommodations, and ordering a dinner at one of the inns, the next thing to be done was unquestionably to walk directly down to the sea.They were come too late in the year for any amusement or variety which Lyme, as a public place, might offer.The rooms were shut up, the lodgers almost all gone, scarcely any family but of the residents left; and, as there is nothing to admire in the buildings themselves, the remarkable situation of the town, the principal street almost hurrying into the water, the walk to the Cobb, skirting round the pleasant little bay, which, in the season, is animated with bathing machines and company; the Cobb itself, its old wonders and new improvements, with the very beautiful line of cliffs stretching out to the east of the town, are what the stranger’s eye will seek; and a very strange stranger it must be, who does not see charms in the immediate environs of Lyme, to make him wish to know it better.The scenes in its neighbourhood, Charmouth, with its high grounds and extensive sweeps of country, and still more, its sweet, retired bay, backed by dark cliffs, where fragments of low rock among the sands, make it the happiest spot for watching the flow of the tide, for sitting in unwearied contemplation; the woody varieties of the cheerful village of Up Lyme; and, above all, Pinny, with its green chasms between romantic rocks, where the scattered forest trees and orchards of luxuriant growth, declare that many a generation must have passed away since the first partial falling of the cliff prepared the ground for such a state, where a scene so wonderful and so lovely is exhibited, as may more than equal any of the resembling scenes of the far-famed Isle of Wight: these places must be visited, and visited again, to make the worth of Lyme understood."
"","The party from Uppercross passing down by the now deserted and melancholy looking rooms, and still descending, soon found themselves on the sea-shore; and lingering only, as all must linger and gaze on a first return to the sea, who ever deserved to look on it at all, proceeded towards the Cobb, equally their object in itself and on Captain Wentworth’s account: for in a small house, near the foot of an old pier of unknown date, were the Harvilles settled.Captain Wentworth turned in to call on his friend; the others walked on, and he was to join them on the Cobb."
"","They were by no means tired of wondering and admiring; and not even Louisa seemed to feel that they had parted with Captain Wentworth long, when they saw him coming after them, with three companions, all well known already, by description, to be Captain and Mrs. Harville, and a Captain Benwick, who was staying with them."
"","Captain Benwick had some time ago been first lieutenant of the Laconia; and the account which Captain Wentworth had given of him, on his return from Lyme before, his warm praise of him as an excellent young man and an officer, whom he had always valued highly, which must have stamped him well in the esteem of every listener, had been followed by a little history of his private life, which rendered him perfectly interesting in the eyes of all the ladies.He had been engaged to Captain Harville’s sister, and was now mourning her loss.They had been a year or two waiting for fortune and promotion.Fortune came, his prize-money as lieutenant being great; promotion, too, came at last; but Fanny Harville did not live to know it.She had died the preceding summer while he was at sea.Captain Wentworth believed it impossible for man to be more attached to woman than poor Benwick had been to Fanny Harville, or to be more deeply afflicted under the dreadful change.He considered his disposition as of the sort which must suffer heavily, uniting very strong feelings with quiet, serious, and retiring manners, and a decided taste for reading, and sedentary pursuits.To finish the interest of the story, the friendship between him and the Harvilles seemed, if possible, augmented by the event which closed all their views of alliance, and Captain Benwick was now living with them entirely.Captain Harville had taken his present house for half a year; his taste, and his health, and his fortune, all directing him to a residence inexpensive, and by the sea; and the grandeur of the country, and the retirement of Lyme in the winter, appeared exactly adapted to Captain Benwick’s state of mind.The sympathy and good-will excited towards Captain Benwick was very great."
"","“And yet,” said Anne to herself, as they now moved forward to meet the party, “he has not, perhaps, a more sorrowing heart than I have.I cannot believe his prospects so blighted for ever.He is younger than I am; younger in feeling, if not in fact; younger as a man.He will rally again, and be happy with another.”"
"","They all met, and were introduced.Captain Harville was a tall, dark man, with a sensible, benevolent countenance; a little lame; and from strong features and want of health, looking much older than Captain Wentworth.Captain Benwick looked, and was, the youngest of the three, and, compared with either of them, a little man.He had a pleasing face and a melancholy air, just as he ought to have, and drew back from conversation."
"","Captain Harville, though not equalling Captain Wentworth in manners, was a perfect gentleman, unaffected, warm, and obliging.Mrs. Harville, a degree less polished than her husband, seemed, however, to have the same good feelings; and nothing could be more pleasant than their desire of considering the whole party as friends of their own, because the friends of Captain Wentworth, or more kindly hospitable than their entreaties for their all promising to dine with them.The dinner, already ordered at the inn, was at last, though unwillingly, accepted as a excuse; but they seemed almost hurt that Captain Wentworth should have brought any such party to Lyme, without considering it as a thing of course that they should dine with them."
"","There was so much attachment to Captain Wentworth in all this, and such a bewitching charm in a degree of hospitality so uncommon, so unlike the usual style of give-and-take invitations, and dinners of formality and display, that Anne felt her spirits not likely to be benefited by an increasing acquaintance among his brother-officers.“These would have been all my friends,” was her thought; and she had to struggle against a great tendency to lowness."
"","On quitting the Cobb, they all went in-doors with their new friends, and found rooms so small as none but those who invite from the heart could think capable of accommodating so many.Anne had a moment’s astonishment on the subject herself; but it was soon lost in the pleasanter feelings which sprang from the sight of all the ingenious contrivances and nice arrangements of Captain Harville, to turn the actual space to the best account, to supply the deficiencies of lodging-house furniture, and defend the windows and doors against the winter storms to be expected.The varieties in the fitting-up of the rooms, where the common necessaries provided by the owner, in the common indifferent plight, were contrasted with some few articles of a rare species of wood, excellently worked up, and with something curious and valuable from all the distant countries Captain Harville had visited, were more than amusing to Anne; connected as it all was with his profession, the fruit of its labours, the effect of its influence on his habits, the picture of repose and domestic happiness it presented, made it to her a something more, or less, than gratification."
"","Captain Harville was no reader; but he had contrived excellent accommodations, and fashioned very pretty shelves, for a tolerable collection of well-bound volumes, the property of Captain Benwick.His lameness prevented him from taking much exercise; but a mind of usefulness and ingenuity seemed to furnish him with constant employment within.He drew, he varnished, he carpentered, he glued; he made toys for the children; he fashioned new netting-needles and pins with improvements; and if everything else was done, sat down to his large fishing-net at one corner of the room."
"","Anne thought she left great happiness behind her when they quitted the house; and Louisa, by whom she found herself walking, burst forth into raptures of admiration and delight on the character of the navy; their friendliness, their brotherliness, their openness, their uprightness; protesting that she was convinced of sailors having more worth and warmth than any other set of men in England; that they only knew how to live, and they only deserved to be respected and loved."
"","They went back to dress and dine; and so well had the scheme answered already, that nothing was found amiss; though its being “so entirely out of season,” and the “no thoroughfare of Lyme,” and the “no expectation of company,” had brought many apologies from the heads of the inn."
"","Anne found herself by this time growing so much more hardened to being in Captain Wentworth’s company than she had at first imagined could ever be, that the sitting down to the same table with him now, and the interchange of the common civilities attending on it (they never got beyond), was become a mere nothing."
"","The nights were too dark for the ladies to meet again till the morrow, but Captain Harville had promised them a visit in the evening; and he came, bringing his friend also, which was more than had been expected, it having been agreed that Captain Benwick had all the appearance of being oppressed by the presence of so many strangers.He ventured among them again, however, though his spirits certainly did not seem fit for the mirth of the party in general."
"","While Captains Wentworth and Harville led the talk on one side of the room, and by recurring to former days, supplied anecdotes in abundance to occupy and entertain the others, it fell to Anne’s lot to be placed rather apart with Captain Benwick; and a very good impulse of her nature obliged her to begin an acquaintance with him.He was shy, and disposed to abstraction; but the engaging mildness of her countenance, and gentleness of her manners, soon had their effect; and Anne was well repaid the first trouble of exertion.He was evidently a young man of considerable taste in reading, though principally in poetry; and besides the persuasion of having given him at least an evening’s indulgence in the discussion of subjects, which his usual companions had probably no concern in, she had the hope of being of real use to him in some suggestions as to the duty and benefit of struggling against affliction, which had naturally grown out of their conversation.For, though shy, he did not seem reserved; it had rather the appearance of feelings glad to burst their usual restraints; and having talked of poetry, the richness of the present age, and gone through a brief comparison of opinion as to the first-rate poets, trying to ascertain whether Marmion or The Lady of the Lake were to be preferred, and how ranked the Giaour and The Bride of Abydos; and moreover, how the Giaour was to be pronounced, he showed himself so intimately acquainted with all the tenderest songs of the one poet, and all the impassioned descriptions of hopeless agony of the other; he repeated, with such tremulous feeling, the various lines which imaged a broken heart, or a mind destroyed by wretchedness, and looked so entirely as if he meant to be understood, that she ventured to hope he did not always read only poetry, and to say, that she thought it was the misfortune of poetry to be seldom safely enjoyed by those who enjoyed it completely; and that the strong feelings which alone could estimat"
"","His looks shewing him not pained, but pleased with this allusion to his situation, she was emboldened to go on; and feeling in herself the right of seniority of mind, she ventured to recommend a larger allowance of prose in his daily study; and on being requested to particularize, mentioned such works of our best moralists, such collections of the finest letters, such memoirs of characters of worth and suffering, as occurred to her at the moment as calculated to rouse and fortify the mind by the highest precepts, and the strongest examples of moral and religious endurances."
"","Captain Benwick listened attentively, and seemed grateful for the interest implied; and though with a shake of the head, and sighs which declared his little faith in the efficacy of any books on grief like his, noted down the names of those she recommended, and promised to procure and read them."
"","When the evening was over, Anne could not but be amused at the idea of her coming to Lyme to preach patience and resignation to a young man whom she had never seen before; nor could she help fearing, on more serious reflection, that, like many other great moralists and preachers, she had been eloquent on a point in which her own conduct would ill bear examination."
"第十二章","CHAPTER 12"
"第二天早晨，安妮和亨里埃塔起床后发现她们是起得最早的，于是决定早饭前到海边走走。她们来到沙滩上看涨潮，当时海风从东南方向徐徐吹来，送来了当地平坦海岸上所能见到的最为壮观的浪潮。她们赞美清晨，颂扬大海，享受着沁人心脾的微风带来的愉悦——接着便沉默了，直到亨里埃塔突然说道：","Anne and Henrietta, finding themselves the earliest of the party the next morning, agreed to stroll down to the sea before breakfast.They went to the sands, to watch the flowing of the tide, which a fine south-easterly breeze was bringing in with all the grandeur which so flat a shore admitted.They praised the morning; gloried in the sea; sympathized in the delight of the fresh-feeling breeze—and were silent; till Henrietta suddenly began again with—"
"“啊！对了——我非常确信，除了个别例外的情况，海边的天气总是对人有益的。去年春天，雪莉博士得了一场大病，毫无疑问，这海边的空气对他起了很大的作用。他自己说，到莱姆的一个月对他的益处超过了他吃下的所有药物。而且在海边总能使他感觉到自己又年轻了。现在我不禁遗憾他不能长住海边了。我确实认为他最好彻底离开阿珀克罗斯，到莱姆定居。安妮，你说呢？你不同意我的说法吗？这种做法对他来说是再好不过了，对他自己和雪莉太太都有好处。你知道，雪莉太太在这儿有几位表兄，还有几位熟人，这会使她很快乐。而且我敢肯定，为了防止雪莉博士病情发作，雪莉太太很高兴到一个可以随时就医的地方。我觉得，雪莉博士夫妇这样一生行善的好人，却只能在阿珀克罗斯这样的地方度过晚年，确实十分遗憾。在那里，除了我们家以外，他们几乎完全与世隔绝。我希望他的朋友们能向他提这个建议。我的确认为他们应该这么做。至于说能否获准，凭雪莉博士的年龄和人格，是不会有困难的。我唯一担心的是能否说服他离开自己的教区。他的思想太严格谨慎了；我得说，他太谨慎了。安妮，难道你不认为他太谨慎了吗？你不觉得一位牧师为了恪尽职守而牺牲自己的健康是一种很错误的观点？他那些工作别人也可以做好。而且莱姆离阿珀克罗斯只有十七英里，如果教区内有人感到不满，那雪莉博士就在附近，他完全可以听得到。”","“Oh! yes,—I am quite convinced that, with very few exceptions, the sea-air always does good.There can be no doubt of its having been of the greatest service to Dr Shirley, after his illness, last spring twelve-month.He declares himself, that coming to Lyme for a month, did him more good than all the medicine he took; and, that being by the sea, always makes him feel young again.Now, I cannot help thinking it a pity that he does not live entirely by the sea.I do think he had better leave Uppercross entirely, and fix at Lyme.Do not you, Anne?Do not you agree with me, that it is the best thing he could do, both for himself and Mrs. Shirley?She has cousins here, you know, and many acquaintance, which would make it cheerful for her, and I am sure she would be glad to get to a place where she could have medical attendance at hand, in case of his having another seizure.Indeed I think it quite melancholy to have such excellent people as Dr and Mrs. Shirley, who have been doing good all their lives, wearing out their last days in a place like Uppercross, where, excepting our family, they seem shut out from all the world.I wish his friends would propose it to him.I really think they ought.And, as to procuring a dispensation, there could be no difficulty at his time of life, and with his character.My only doubt is, whether anything could persuade him to leave his parish.He is so very strict and scrupulous in his notions; over-scrupulous I must say.Do not you think, Anne, it is being over-scrupulous?Do not you think it is quite a mistaken point of conscience, when a clergyman sacrifices his health for the sake of duties, which may be just as well performed by another person?And at Lyme too, only seventeen miles off, he would be near enough to hear, if people thought there was anything to complain of.”"
"亨里埃塔讲这番话的时候，安妮不止一次地暗自微笑，她接过话茬说了几句。她这么做既是同情这位年轻姑娘的感情，也是同情那位小伙子的感情，不过也只是轻描淡写，因为除了一般的默认，还能做什么呢？她对此事提出了一些合乎情理而又十分得体的看法。她觉得雪莉博士的确应该休息了，她当时也只能这么说。她还说雪莉博士最好能够聘请一位积极的、正派的年轻人做常驻牧师，她还礼貌地暗示，这样的常驻牧师最好是已婚男子。","Anne smiled more than once to herself during this speech, and entered into the subject, as ready to do good by entering into the feelings of a young lady as of a young man, though here it was good of a lower standard, for what could be offered but general acquiescence?She said all that was reasonable and proper on the business; felt the claims of Dr Shirley to repose as she ought; saw how very desirable it was that he should have some active, respectable young man, as a resident curate, and was even courteous enough to hint at the advantage of such resident curate’s being married."
"“我希望，”亨里埃塔颇为满意地对安妮说，“我希望拉塞尔夫人住在阿珀克罗斯，成为雪莉博士的密友。我一直听说拉塞尔夫人是一位对所有人都能产生影响的女人！我一向认为她能劝说任何人去做任何事！我怕她，就像我以前跟你说过的，我相当怕她，因为她太聪明了。不过我非常尊重她，希望我们在阿珀克罗斯也有这样一位邻居。”","“I wish,” said Henrietta, very well pleased with her companion, “I wish Lady Russell lived at Uppercross, and were intimate with Dr Shirley.I have always heard of Lady Russell as a woman of the greatest influence with everybody!I always look upon her as able to persuade a person to anything!I am afraid of her, as I have told you before, quite afraid of her, because she is so very clever; but I respect her amazingly, and wish we had such a neighbour at Uppercross.”"
"亨里埃塔这种表达感激的方式让安妮觉得很有趣，让她觉得有趣的还有，事态的发展和亨里埃塔当前所关心的事情竟然会使她的朋友得到马斯格罗夫家族某一成员的赏识。她刚刚给出了一般性的回答，希望在阿珀克罗斯能找到另一位这样的女人，不过话就这样中断了，只见路易莎和温特沃思上校朝她们走了过来。他们也想趁着在早饭准备好之前出来溜达溜达。但是路易莎随后马上想起要去商店里买点东西，便邀请他们陪她一起回镇上去。大家都接受了她的提议。","Anne was amused by Henrietta’s manner of being grateful, and amused also that the course of events and the new interests of Henrietta’s views should have placed her friend at all in favour with any of the Musgrove family; she had only time, however, for a general answer, and a wish that such another woman were at Uppercross, before all subjects suddenly ceased, on seeing Louisa and Captain Wentworth coming towards them.They came also for a stroll till breakfast was likely to be ready; but Louisa recollecting, immediately afterwards that she had something to procure at a shop, invited them all to go back with her into the town.They were all at her disposal."
"他们正要登上从海滩通往高处的石级时，一位刚准备往下走的绅士彬彬有礼地往后一退，停下来给他们让路。他们拾级而上，从他身边走过。这时安妮的脸庞吸引了他的注意，他带着某种真挚的爱慕看着安妮，安妮对此不会毫无察觉。她看上去特别动人。她那端庄秀丽的面庞经微风一吹拂，又焕发出青春的红润与清新，眼睛也充满了活力。这位绅士（从举止上看完全是位绅士）显然对她极为倾慕。温特沃思上校马上转头朝她望去，表明他注意到了这一点。他瞥了她一眼，和颜悦色地瞥了她一眼，仿佛在说：“那位绅士对你着迷了，连我在这个时刻也觉得你又有些像安妮•埃利奥特了。”","When they came to the steps, leading upwards from the beach, a gentleman, at the same moment preparing to come down, politely drew back, and stopped to give them way.They ascended and passed him; and as they passed, Anne’s face caught his eye, and he looked at her with a degree of earnest admiration, which she could not be insensible of.She was looking remarkably well; her very regular, very pretty features, having the bloom and freshness of youth restored by the fine wind which had been blowing on her complexion, and by the animation of eye which it had also produced.It was evident that the gentleman, (completely a gentleman in manner) admired her exceedingly.Captain Wentworth looked round at her instantly in a way which shewed his noticing of it.He gave her a momentary glance, a glance of brightness, which seemed to say, “That man is struck with you, and even I, at this moment, see something like Anne Elliot again.”"
"他们陪路易莎买好了东西，又逛了一会儿，才回到旅馆。后来安妮从卧室匆匆向餐厅走去的时候，差点撞上了那位绅士，因为他这时正从旁边的套房中出来。安妮起先猜测他同他们一样是从外地来的，当他们回旅馆时，安妮看到在两间旅馆之间有一位英俊的马夫在散步，便断定那是他的仆人。主仆两人都在服丧，这就更证实了她的猜想。现在证实他同安妮住在同一个旅馆。第二次撞见尽管只有一刹那，但绅士的目光又再一次表明，他认为安妮是一个非常可爱的姑娘，而且从他那爽快得体的道歉中，可以看出他是一位颇有风度的绅士。他约摸三十岁，虽说并不算英俊，但也挺讨人喜欢。安妮觉得她想知道他是谁。","After attending Louisa through her business, and loitering about a little longer, they returned to the inn; and Anne, in passing afterwards quickly from her own chamber to their dining-room, had nearly run against the very same gentleman, as he came out of an adjoining apartment.She had before conjectured him to be a stranger like themselves, and determined that a well-looking groom, who was strolling about near the two inns as they came back, should be his servant.Both master and man being in mourning assisted the idea.It was now proved that he belonged to the same inn as themselves; and this second meeting, short as it was, also proved again by the gentleman’s looks, that he thought hers very lovely, and by the readiness and propriety of his apologies, that he was a man of exceedingly good manners.He seemed about thirty, and though not handsome, had an agreeable person.Anne felt that she should like to know who he was."
"大家快吃完早饭的时候，一阵马车声（这几乎是他们来到莱姆以后第一次听到马车的声音）将半数人吸引到窗口去了。这是一位绅士的马车，一辆双轮轻便马车，只不过是从马车场驶到前门来的。准是有人要走了。驾车的是个正在服丧的仆人。","They had nearly done breakfast, when the sound of a carriage, (almost the first they had heard since entering Lyme) drew half the party to the window.It was a gentleman’s carriage, a curricle, but only coming round from the stable-yard to the front door; somebody must be going away.It was driven by a servant in mourning."
"一听说是双轮轻便马车，查尔斯•马斯格罗夫便跳了起来，他想将这辆马车同自己的那辆比比看。服丧的仆人激起了安妮的好奇心，马车的主人在旅馆主人一家哈腰送行下走到门口，登上马车出发时，他们六个人全都聚在一起张望了。","The word curricle made Charles Musgrove jump up that he might compare it with his own; the servant in mourning roused Anne’s curiosity, and the whole six were collected to look, by the time the owner of the curricle was to be seen issuing from the door amidst the bows and civilities of the household, and taking his seat, to drive off."
"“啊！”温特沃思上校马上嚷道，同时瞥了安妮一眼，“这就是我们刚才遇到的那个人。”","“Ah!” cried Captain Wentworth, instantly, and with half a glance at Anne, “it is the very man we passed.”"
"两位马斯格罗夫小姐表示同意。大家友好地目送那人朝山上驶去，知道看不见了他们才回到餐桌旁。过了一会儿，招待走了进来。","The Miss Musgroves agreed to it; and having all kindly watched him as far up the hill as they could, they returned to the breakfast table.The waiter came into the room soon afterwards."
"“请问，”温特沃思上校马上问道，“你能告诉我们刚才离开的那位绅士的姓名吗？”","“Pray,” said Captain Wentworth, immediately, “can you tell us the name of the gentleman who is just gone away?”"
"“好的，先生，他是埃利奥特先生，一位非常有钱的绅士，昨晚从希德茅斯来的。先生，你们昨天吃晚饭的时候一定听见了马车声。现在他是要到克鲁克恩去，接着还要去巴斯和伦敦。”","“Yes, Sir, a Mr. Elliot, a gentleman of large fortune, came in last night from Sidmouth.Dare say you heard the carriage, sir, while you were at dinner; and going on now for Crewkherne, in his way to Bath and London.”"
"“埃利奥特！”大家面面相觑，一些人还重复着这个名字，过了一会儿，大家才明白全部含义，连那个机灵的招待都猜出了其中的奥秘。","“Elliot!”Many had looked on each other, and many had repeated the name, before all this had been got through, even by the smart rapidity of a waiter."
"“天哪！”玛丽大声嚷道，“那一定是我们的堂兄。那一定是我们的埃利奥特先生，一定是的，真的！查尔斯，安妮，对吗？在服丧，你们瞧，我们那埃利奥特先生也应该这样。真凑巧！就和我们住在同一个旅馆里。安妮，他不正是我们那位埃利奥特先生？爸爸的继承人？请问，先生，”她转脸问那位招待，“你有没有听到他的仆人说起他是凯林奇家族的人？”","“Bless me!” cried Mary; “it must be our cousin; it must be our Mr. Elliot, it must, indeed!Charles, Anne, must not it?In mourning, you see, just as our Mr. Elliot must be.How very extraordinary!In the very same inn with us!Anne, must not it be our Mr. Elliot? my father’s next heir?Pray sir,” turning to the waiter, “did not you hear, did not his servant say whether he belonged to the Kellynch family?”"
"“没有，太太，他没有提起过具体的家族名称。但是他说过他的主人是个非常有钱的绅士，有朝一日会成为准男爵。”","“No, ma’am, he did not mention no particular family; but he said his master was a very rich gentleman, and would be a baronight some day.”"
"“啊！你们瞧！”玛丽兴奋地嚷道，“就像我说的！沃尔特•埃利奥特爵士的继承人！我就知道，若是真的如此，总会有人知道的。相信我好了，不管他走到哪儿去，他的仆人们都要有意宣扬这一点。不过，安妮，你想想，这事多不同寻常！我真希望我刚才能多看他几眼。我们要是早些知道他是谁就好了，那样我们就可以结识他了。真可惜，我们竟然没有彼此介绍一下！你觉得他的面貌像埃利奥特家的人吗？我几乎没怎么看她，只顾看他的两匹马了。不过我觉得他的面貌有几分像埃利奥特家的人，真奇怪，他的徽章竟然没有引起我的注意！哦！他的那件厚大衣正好搭在车板上，遮住了徽章，就是这么回事。否则我肯定会看到的，还有那制服。那个仆人要是不穿丧服，别人一看他的制服就能看出来。”","“There! you see!” cried Mary in an ecstasy, “just as I said!Heir to Sir Walter Elliot!I was sure that would come out, if it was so.Depend upon it, that is a circumstance which his servants take care to publish, wherever he goes.But, Anne, only conceive how extraordinary!I wish I had looked at him more.I wish we had been aware in time, who it was, that he might have been introduced to us.What a pity that we should not have been introduced to each other!Do you think he had the Elliot countenance?I hardly looked at him, I was looking at the horses; but I think he had something of the Elliot countenance, I wonder the arms did not strike me!Oh! the great-coat was hanging over the panel, and hid the arms, so it did; otherwise, I am sure, I should have observed them, and the livery too; if the servant had not been in mourning, one should have known him by the livery.”"
"“从这些凑巧的事情来看，”温特沃思上校说道，“我们必须把你们没有同堂兄结识这件事看作是上帝的安排。”","“Putting all these very extraordinary circumstances together,” said Captain Wentworth, “we must consider it to be the arrangement of Providence, that you should not be introduced to your cousin.”"
"等到玛丽愿意倾听别人的话时，安妮才平静地劝她，要她相信，根据多年来她们父亲同埃利奥特先生的关系，想同他结识是不合时宜的。","When she could command Mary’s attention, Anne quietly tried to convince her that their father and Mr. Elliot had not, for many years, been on such terms as to make the power of attempting an introduction at all desirable."
"不过，这时安妮心中倒窃喜能遇见她的堂兄，知道凯林奇未来的主人无疑是位绅士，而且显得很讲情理。她无论如何不会提起自己与他的第二次相遇。幸亏玛丽对他们清晨散步时同他擦身而过的一幕没有怎么在意，但是如果知道安妮在走廊里几乎同他撞了个满怀，并且收到了他非常有礼貌的道歉，而玛丽自己却从未接近过他，玛丽会感到受到了很大的委屈。不，对堂兄妹之间那次短暂的会面一定要绝对保密。","At the same time, however, it was a secret gratification to herself to have seen her cousin, and to know that the future owner of Kellynch was undoubtedly a gentleman, and had an air of good sense.She would not, upon any account, mention her having met with him the second time; luckily Mary did not much attend to their having passed close by him in their earlier walk, but she would have felt quite ill-used by Anne’s having actually run against him in the passage, and received his very polite excuses, while she had never been near him at all; no, that cousinly little interview must remain a perfect secret."
"“当然，”玛丽说，“下次你往巴斯写信的时候一定要提一下我们遇见了埃利奥特先生。我觉得父亲当然应该知道这件事情，一定要把有关他的一切都告诉他。”","“Of course,” said Mary, “you will mention our seeing Mr. Elliot, the next time you write to Bath.I think my father certainly ought to hear of it; do mention all about him.”"
"安妮没有直接回答，不过她认为这个情况不仅没有必要提起，而且应该避而不谈。她知道，许多年以前，他曾经得罪过父亲。她猜想，他尤其得罪了伊丽莎白。因此，毫无疑问，一提起埃利奥特先生，他们两个人一定会很生气。玛丽自己从来都不往巴斯写信，因而同伊丽莎白之间进行拖拖拉拉、不怎么令人满意的通信就落在了安妮的身上。","Anne avoided a direct reply, but it was just the circumstance which she considered as not merely unnecessary to be communicated, but as what ought to be suppressed.The offence which had been given her father, many years back, she knew; Elizabeth’s particular share in it she suspected; and that Mr. Elliot’s idea always produced irritation in both was beyond a doubt.Mary never wrote to Bath herself; all the toil of keeping up a slow and unsatisfactory correspondence with Elizabeth fell on Anne."
"早饭吃过不久，哈维尔上校和本威克舰长就来看他们了。他们约定要最后逛一下莱姆。他们应该在一点钟离开这里去阿珀克罗斯，这一段时间应尽量一起在户外度过。","Breakfast had not been long over, when they were joined by Captain and Mrs. Harville and Captain Benwick; with whom they had appointed to take their last walk about Lyme.They ought to be setting off for Uppercross by one, and in the mean while were to be all together, and out of doors as long as they could."
"安妮发现，他们一走到街上，本威克舰长就凑到了她身边。他们头天晚上的谈话并没有使他不愿再接近她。他们在一起走了一会儿，就像以前那样，谈谈司各特和拜伦伯爵，同其他任何两位读者一样，对于这两位作家的评价，他们还是同以前那样，无法取得一致的意见。后来出了点什么事，几乎使他们所有人重新组合一次，于是安妮身边走的不是本威克舰长，而是哈维尔上校了。","Anne found Captain Benwick getting near her, as soon as they were all fairly in the street.Their conversation the preceding evening did not disincline him to seek her again; and they walked together some time, talking as before of Mr. Scott and Lord Byron, and still as unable as before, and as unable as any other two readers, to think exactly alike of the merits of either, till something occasioned an almost general change amongst their party, and instead of Captain Benwick, she had Captain Harville by her side."
"“埃利奥特小姐，”哈维尔上校略略压低声音说，“你做了件好事，让那可怜的人讲了这么多话。但愿他能常有你这样的伙伴。我知道，像他这样把自己封闭起来，对他自己也没有什么好处。可是我们能做什么呢？我们分不开啊。”","“Miss Elliot,” said he, speaking rather low, “you have done a good deed in making that poor fellow talk so much.I wish he could have such company oftener.It is bad for him, I know, to be shut up as he is; but what can we do?We cannot part.”"
"“不，”安妮说，“我完全相信这不可能。不过，也许有一天——我们知道时间对所有悲痛所起的作用。你应该知道，哈维尔上校，你朋友才失去亲人不久——我想是在今年夏天吧。”","“No,” said Anne, “that I can easily believe to be impossible; but in time, perhaps—we know what time does in every case of affliction, and you must remember, Captain Harville, that your friend may yet be called a young mourner—only last summer, I understand.”"
"“唉，确实如此，”（伴着一声长叹）“就在六月。”","“Ay, true enough,” (with a deep sigh) “only June.”"
"“他当时也许没有马上得知这一消息。”","“And not known to him, perhaps, so soon.”"
"“他直到八月份的第一个星期才知道，当时他正从好望角回来，刚刚调到‘格斗者号’。当时我在普利茅斯，很害怕听到他的消息。他写了好几封信来，可是“格斗者号”奉命开往朴茨茅斯。应该在那里把消息告诉他，可是由谁去说呢？我可不会去。我宁愿让别人把我赶到帆桁顶端上去。谁也干不了，除了那位好人以外。”（指了指温特沃思上校。）“而‘拉科尼亚号’在一个星期以前就已经到达普利茅斯，不会再奉命出海了。温特沃思上校顾不上其他事情，向他的上司打了个请假报告，没等接到答复便日夜兼程赶到朴茨茅斯去了。一到那里就马上划船到‘格斗者号’去了，整整一个星期都没有离开他那可怜的朋友。这就是他做的，别人可拯救不了可怜的詹姆斯。你可以想一想，埃利奥特小姐，他对我们是不是很亲爱！”","“Not till the first week of August, when he came home from the Cape, just made into the Grappler.I was at Plymouth dreading to hear of him; he sent in letters, but the Grappler was under orders for Portsmouth.There the news must follow him, but who was to tell it?not I. I would as soon have been run up to the yard-arm.Nobody could do it, but that good fellow” (pointing to Captain Wentworth.)“The Laconia had come into Plymouth the week before; no danger of her being sent to sea again.He stood his chance for the rest; wrote up for leave of absence, but without waiting the return, travelled night and day till he got to Portsmouth, rowed off to the Grappler that instant, and never left the poor fellow for a week.That’s what he did, and nobody else could have saved poor James.You may think, Miss Elliot, whether he is dear to us!”"
"安妮对此事确实认真思考了一下，根据自己的真实感情和哈维尔上校能够接受的程度给出了充分的回答，因为哈维尔上校实在是太动情了，无法重提这个话题。等他再次开口时，说的就完全是另外一件事了。","Anne did think on the question with perfect decision, and said as much in reply as her own feeling could accomplish, or as his seemed able to bear, for he was too much affected to renew the subject, and when he spoke again, it was of something totally different."
"哈维尔太太提了个意见，觉得回家的路已经够她丈夫步行的了，所以为他们的最后一次散步确定了一条路线。大家陪他们走到门口，然后返回来，准备出发。根据他们的计算，恐怕只剩下这么一点时间了，但当他们走近科布的时候，大家都希望再去那里走一遭，所有人都有这种愿望，路易莎更是十分坚决，大家都认为只不过相差一刻钟，没有多大关系。于是在一片惜别、邀请和承诺声中，他们让哈维尔夫妇和本威克上校在门口留步，本威克舰长还陪着他们，似乎要陪他们到最后一刻。他们继续往前走，正式向科布告别。","Mrs. Harville’s giving it as her opinion that her husband would have quite walking enough by the time he reached home, determined the direction of all the party in what was to be their last walk; they would accompany them to their door, and then return and set off themselves.By all their calculations there was just time for this; but as they drew near the Cobb, there was such a general wish to walk along it once more, all were so inclined, and Louisa soon grew so determined, that the difference of a quarter of an hour, it was found, would be no difference at all; so with all the kind leave-taking, and all the kind interchange of invitations and promises which may be imagined, they parted from Captain and Mrs. Harville at their own door, and still accompanied by Captain Benwick, who seemed to cling to them to the last, proceeded to make the proper adieus to the Cobb."
"安妮发现本威克上校又一次走到她身旁。眼前的景色自然使他们提到了拜伦伯爵的“深蓝色的海洋”。安妮十分高兴地尽量把她的注意力全部集中在他身上。可是不一会儿，她便不由自主地给吸引到别处去了。","Anne found Captain Benwick again drawing near her.Lord Byron’s “dark blue seas” could not fail of being brought forward by their present view, and she gladly gave him all her attention as long as attention was possible.It was soon drawn, perforce another way."
"因为风大，女士们呆在新科布的高处觉得不舒服，所以大家都同意沿着石阶往下走。她们都安静而小心地沿着陡峭的石阶往下走，只有路易莎例外。她要温特沃思上校扶着她从石阶上跳下去。在他们以前多次散步中，她总让温特沃思上校扶着她从栅栏边的梯级上跳下去。她觉得这样的感觉很惬意。眼下，上校觉得这里的地面太硬，对路易莎的双脚不利，所以不太愿意这么做。但是，他还是扶着她跳了。她安然无恙地跳下来，为了显示她爱这么做，她马上又跑上去，想再跳一次。温特沃思上校劝她不要这么做，觉得震动太大了。但是不行，他再怎么讲理和劝说都无济于事，她笑吟吟地说：“我下定了决心，一定要跳。”他伸出了双手，不过路易莎早起跳了半秒钟，摔倒在科布低处的路面上，等人们扶起她时，她已经失去了知觉。她身上没有伤口，没有流血，也没有看到擦伤的地方，但是她双眼紧闭，没有呼吸，脸色像死人一样。当时站在旁边的人都给吓坏了！","There was too much wind to make the high part of the new Cobb pleasant for the ladies, and they agreed to get down the steps to the lower, and all were contented to pass quietly and carefully down the steep flight, excepting Louisa; she must be jumped down them by Captain Wentworth.In all their walks, he had had to jump her from the stiles; the sensation was delightful to her.The hardness of the pavement for her feet, made him less willing upon the present occasion; he did it, however.She was safely down, and instantly, to show her enjoyment, ran up the steps to be jumped down again.He advised her against it, thought the jar too great; but no, he reasoned and talked in vain, she smiled and said, “I am determined I will:” he put out his hands; she was too precipitate by half a second, she fell on the pavement on the Lower Cobb, and was taken up lifeless!There was no wound, no blood, no visible bruise; but her eyes were closed, she breathed not, her face was like death.The horror of the moment to all who stood around!"
"温特沃思上校把她扶起来，抱着她跪在那里，他望着路易莎，默默地忍受着痛苦，脸色同她一样苍白。“她死了！她死了！”玛丽抓住了丈夫，尖声叫道，这就加剧了查尔斯本人的恐惧，使他动弹不得。不一会儿，亨里埃塔相信了玛丽的话，晕了过去，要不是本威克舰长和安妮一边一个扶住她，她会摔倒在石阶上。","Captain Wentworth, who had caught her up, knelt with her in his arms, looking on her with a face as pallid as her own, in an agony of silence.“She is dead!she is dead!” screamed Mary, catching hold of her husband, and contributing with his own horror to make him immoveable; and in another moment, Henrietta, sinking under the conviction, lost her senses too, and would have fallen on the steps, but for Captain Benwick and Anne, who caught and supported her between them."
"“难道就没有人来帮帮我吗？”这是温特沃思带着绝望的口气说出的第一句话，看来他自己一点力气也没有了。","“Is there no one to help me?” were the first words which burst from Captain Wentworth, in a tone of despair, and as if all his own strength were gone."
"“快过去，快过去，”安妮喊道，“看在上帝的份上快过去吧。我一个人可以扶住亨里埃塔。别管我，你去帮忙。揉揉她的手，揉揉她的太阳穴。这里有盐，拿着，拿着。”","“Go to him, go to him,” cried Anne, “for heaven’s sake go to him.I can support her myself.Leave me, and go to him.Rub her hands, rub her temples; here are salts; take them, take them.”"
"本威克舰长听从她的指挥，查尔斯这时也离开了妻子一起来到温特沃思上校前。他俩把路易莎扶起来，牢牢地架住，温特沃思上校将安妮提的几点都做了一遍，可是毫无用处。这时温特沃思上校跌跌撞撞地扶住墙壁，悲痛欲绝地喊道：","Captain Benwick obeyed, and Charles at the same moment, disengaging himself from his wife, they were both with him; and Louisa was raised up and supported more firmly between them, and everything was done that Anne had prompted, but in vain; while Captain Wentworth, staggering against the wall for his support, exclaimed in the bitterest agony—"
"“啊！天哪！他父母那儿怎么办！”","“Oh God! her father and mother!”"
"“去找外科医生！”安妮说道。","“A surgeon!” said Anne."
"温特沃思一听这话，似乎猛地惊醒过来，只说了句：“对，对，马上去找外科医生。”然后拔腿便跑，这时安妮急忙提出：","He caught the word; it seemed to rouse him at once, and saying only—“True, true, a surgeon this instant,” was darting away, when Anne eagerly suggested—"
"“本威克舰长，让本威克舰长去岂不是更好？他知道哪儿能够找到一位外科医生。”","“Captain Benwick, would not it be better for Captain Benwick?He knows where a surgeon is to be found.”"
"每一个清醒的人都觉得这个主意好，顷刻间，（这一切都是在顷刻间完成的）本威克舰长将那可怜的姑娘交给他哥哥照料，自己飞快地朝镇上跑去。","Every one capable of thinking felt the advantage of the idea, and in a moment (it was all done in rapid moments) Captain Benwick had resigned the poor corpse-like figure entirely to the brother’s care, and was off for the town with the utmost rapidity."
"至于说到留在原地的三个神智完全清醒的人：温特沃思上校、安妮、还是查尔斯，很难说谁最痛苦。查尔斯的确是个亲如手足的哥哥，他低头看着路易莎，悲痛地抽泣着。他只能将眼睛从这个妹妹的身上转过去看另一位不省人事的妹妹，或者看看歇斯底里发作的妻子，妻子喊他去照顾她，他却不能过去。","As to the wretched party left behind, it could scarcely be said which of the three, who were completely rational, was suffering most: Captain Wentworth, Anne, or Charles, who, really a very affectionate brother, hung over Louisa with sobs of grief, and could only turn his eyes from one sister, to see the other in a state as insensible, or to witness the hysterical agitations of his wife, calling on him for help which he could not give."
"安妮一面凭着直觉尽力热忱地照顾着亨里埃塔，一面还要不时地设法安慰别人，劝玛丽安静下来，鼓励查尔斯，宽慰温特沃思上校。这两个人似乎都在等待她的指令。","Anne, attending with all the strength and zeal, and thought, which instinct supplied, to Henrietta, still tried, at intervals, to suggest comfort to the others, tried to quiet Mary, to animate Charles, to assuage the feelings of Captain Wentworth.Both seemed to look to her for directions."
"“安妮，安妮，”查尔斯喊道，“下一步怎么办？天哪，下一步怎么办？”","“Anne, Anne,” cried Charles, “What is to be done next?What, in heaven’s name, is to be done next?”"
"温特沃思上校也将目光投向了她。","Captain Wentworth’s eyes were also turned towards her."
"“是不是把她抱到旅馆去要好一点？是的，我想是的，轻轻地把她抱到旅馆里去吧。”","“Had not she better be carried to the inn?Yes, I am sure: carry her gently to the inn.”"
"“对，对，抱到旅馆里去，”温特沃思上校重复着，他相对镇定了一些，急切地想做点什么。“我来抱她。马斯格罗夫，你来照顾其他人。”","“Yes, yes, to the inn,” repeated Captain Wentworth, comparatively collected, and eager to be doing something.“I will carry her myself.Musgrove, take care of the others.”"
"这时，出事的消息传遍了科布附近的工人和船员，许多人聚在他们身旁，想在需要时帮点忙。不管怎么样，可以看一看一位死去的年轻姑娘，不，是两位死去的年轻姑娘，因为事实证明这比起初的消息更为吸引人。他们把亨里埃塔托付给好心人中看上去比较体面的人，她虽然已经苏醒过来，但还非常虚弱。于是，安妮走在亨里埃塔旁边，查尔斯照顾着妻子，一行人就这样出发了。刚才就在几分钟前，大家还十分高兴地走过这片土地，但现在往回走时，一个个却忧心如焚。","By this time the report of the accident had spread among the workmen and boatmen about the Cobb, and many were collected near them, to be useful if wanted, at any rate, to enjoy the sight of a dead young lady, nay, two dead young ladies, for it proved twice as fine as the first report.To some of the best-looking of these good people Henrietta was consigned, for, though partially revived, she was quite helpless; and in this manner, Anne walking by her side, and Charles attending to his wife, they set forward, treading back with feelings unutterable, the ground, which so lately, so very lately, and so light of heart, they had passed along."
"他们还没有离开科布，哈维尔夫妇便赶来了。原来，他们看见本威克舰长从屋旁飞奔而过，一看那慌张的神色，就知道出了事。于是马上出门，一路上听人连说带比划就找来了。哈维尔上校虽说十分震惊，但他的见识和胆量马上就起了作用。他和妻子交换了一下眼色，当即决定了应该怎么办。必须把路易莎带到他们家，所有人也必须到他们家去，在那里等待外科医生的到来。他们夫妇俩根本不考虑别人的顾虑。大家就听从了哈维尔上校，都来到了他家里。在哈维尔太太的指挥下，路易莎被抱上楼，放在她自己的床上，她丈夫也在跟着帮忙，又是镇静剂，又是苏醒剂，谁需要就给谁。","They were not off the Cobb, before the Harvilles met them.Captain Benwick had been seen flying by their house, with a countenance which showed something to be wrong; and they had set off immediately, informed and directed as they passed, towards the spot.Shocked as Captain Harville was, he brought senses and nerves that could be instantly useful; and a look between him and his wife decided what was to be done.She must be taken to their house; all must go to their house; and await the surgeon’s arrival there.They would not listen to scruples: he was obeyed; they were all beneath his roof; and while Louisa, under Mrs. Harville’s direction, was conveyed up stairs, and given possession of her own bed, assistance, cordials, restoratives were supplied by her husband to all who needed them."
"路易莎的眼睛睁开了一次，但是没有明显的知觉，就又闭上了。不过，这倒证明她还活着，这一点对亨里埃塔是个鼓舞。尽管亨里埃塔和她姐姐还不能呆在同一间屋子里，但她有了希望，还有几分恐惧，激动之下没有再昏厥过去。玛丽也逐渐镇定了下来。","Louisa had once opened her eyes, but soon closed them again, without apparent consciousness.This had been a proof of life, however, of service to her sister; and Henrietta, though perfectly incapable of being in the same room with Louisa, was kept, by the agitation of hope and fear, from a return of her own insensibility.Mary, too, was growing calmer."
"外科医生很快就来了，真出人意料。他检查的时候，大家都吓得心惊胆跳，但医生没有绝望。病人的头部受到了剧烈的震动，但是比这更重的病他都治好过。他一点也不绝望，说话的口气还很乐观。","The surgeon was with them almost before it had seemed possible.They were sick with horror, while he examined; but he was not hopeless.The head had received a severe contusion, but he had seen greater injuries recovered from: he was by no means hopeless; he spoke cheerfully."
"医生并没有认为这是一个绝望的病例，他没有说路易莎会在几个小时之后死亡，这都出乎大多数人的意料。人们先是对上帝表达了多么热诚的感激，接着便深沉不语地欣喜起来，这高兴劲头可想而知。","That he did not regard it as a desperate case, that he did not say a few hours must end it, was at first felt, beyond the hope of most; and the ecstasy of such a reprieve, the rejoicing, deep and silent, after a few fervent ejaculations of gratitude to Heaven had been offered, may be conceived."
"安妮觉得她永远也不会忘记温特沃思上校喊“谢天谢地”时的声调和神色，也忘不了后来他倚在桌旁，脸埋在交抱的双臂时的形象。看样子，他已经被心中的忧伤所击倒，因而力图通过祈祷和冥思来稳定情绪。","The tone, the look, with which “Thank God!” was uttered by Captain Wentworth, Anne was sure could never be forgotten by her; nor the sight of him afterwards, as he sat near a table, leaning over it with folded arms and face concealed, as if overpowered by the various feelings of his soul, and trying by prayer and reflection to calm them."
"路易莎的四肢没有受伤。除了头部，其他部位都没有受伤。","Louisa’s limbs had escaped.There was no injury but to the head."
"当下大家有必要考虑如何处理整个局面才好。现在他们能够交换意见和商量问题了。路易莎必须留在这里，这一点毫无疑问，尽管她的朋友们对于给哈维尔夫妇增添这么多麻烦，心中很是不安。路易莎是不能移动的。哈维尔夫妇打消了大家的顾虑，尽可能婉言拒绝了大伙的感激之情。他们没等别人开始想到，就着手安排好了一切。本威克舰长把房间让给他们，到别的地方铺一张床。所有的问题就解决了。他们担心的倒是这屋子里住不下更多的人。不过也许可以“让孩子们住到女仆的房间里，或者在别的地方挂一只吊床，”可还有两三个愿意留下的人无处安顿，这使主人十分焦急。至于对马斯格罗夫小姐的照顾，大家尽可以放心地把这事托付给哈维尔太太。哈维尔太太过去是一位经验很丰富的护士，而同她一起住了很久，随时伺候在她身旁的那个带孩子的保姆，也是一名好护士。有了她们两个，她就不需要被别人日夜看护了。这番话说得真挚而诚恳，使人感到盛情难却。","It now became necessary for the party to consider what was best to be done, as to their general situation.They were now able to speak to each other and consult.That Louisa must remain where she was, however distressing to her friends to be involving the Harvilles in such trouble, did not admit a doubt.Her removal was impossible.The Harvilles silenced all scruples; and, as much as they could, all gratitude.They had looked forward and arranged everything before the others began to reflect.Captain Benwick must give up his room to them, and get another bed elsewhere; and the whole was settled.They were only concerned that the house could accommodate no more; and yet perhaps, by “putting the children away in the maid’s room, or swinging a cot somewhere,” they could hardly bear to think of not finding room for two or three besides, supposing they might wish to stay; though, with regard to any attendance on Miss Musgrove, there need not be the least uneasiness in leaving her to Mrs. Harville’s care entirely.Mrs. Harville was a very experienced nurse, and her nursery-maid, who had lived with her long, and gone about with her everywhere, was just such another.Between these two, she could want no possible attendance by day or night.And all this was said with a truth and sincerity of feeling irresistible."
"参与商量的三个人是查尔斯、亨里埃塔和温特沃思上校。说是商量，但有一阵子只是你表示一筹莫展，他表示害怕而已。“阿珀克罗斯，一定要派人到阿珀克罗斯去通报一下。但是怎样才能对默斯格罗夫先生和太太说清楚呢，上午的时间已经过去不少了，他们本该一小时之前就出发的。现在已不可能及时赶到那里。”起初，他们只是你一言我一语的，想不出好主意。但是，过了一小会儿，温特沃思上校强打精神说：","Charles, Henrietta, and Captain Wentworth were the three in consultation, and for a little while it was only an interchange of perplexity and terror.“Uppercross, the necessity of some one’s going to Uppercross; the news to be conveyed; how it could be broken to Mr. and Mrs. Musgrove; the lateness of the morning; an hour already gone since they ought to have been off; the impossibility of being in tolerable time.” At first, they were capable of nothing more to the purpose than such exclamations; but, after a while, Captain Wentworth, exerting himself, said—"
"“我们必须果断一点，一分钟也不能耽误了。每一分钟都十分宝贵。必须马上派人到阿珀克罗斯去。马斯格罗夫，不是你去就是我去。”","“We must be decided, and without the loss of another minute.Every minute is valuable.Some one must resolve on being off for Uppercross instantly.Musgrove, either you or I must go.”"
"查尔斯同意这一意见，但表示他绝不离开这里。他不愿给哈维尔夫妇增添麻烦，但看到他妹妹目前的处境，他不应该，也不愿意离开她。到目前为止，事情就这么定下来了。亨里埃塔最初也是这么说的。不过，她很快就被说服，改变了主意。她留下有什么用！何况让她留在路易莎的房间里，让她看到路易莎，都只会使她比无助更糟糕！她不得不承认自己帮不上忙，可依然不愿意离开，后来她想起了自己的父母亲，感到一阵难过，这才放弃了留下的念头，急着想回家了。","Charles agreed, but declared his resolution of not going away.He would be as little incumbrance as possible to Captain and Mrs. Harville; but as to leaving his sister in such a state, he neither ought, nor would.So far it was decided; and Henrietta at first declared the same.She, however, was soon persuaded to think differently.The usefulness of her staying!She who had not been able to remain in Louisa’s room, or to look at her, without sufferings which made her worse than helpless!She was forced to acknowledge that she could do no good, yet was still unwilling to be away, till, touched by the thought of her father and mother, she gave it up; she consented, she was anxious to be at home."
"他们正谈到这一步，这时安妮从路易莎房中轻轻地走下来，不免听到这番谈话，因为客厅门开着。","The plan had reached this point, when Anne, coming quietly down from Louisa’s room, could not but hear what followed, for the parlour door was open."
"“那么就这样定了，马斯格罗夫，”温特沃思上校高声说道，“你留下，我送你妹妹回家。至于其他人，如果需要有人留下帮助哈维尔太太，我想一个人就足够了。查尔斯•马斯格罗夫太太当然想回去照看孩子。但是如果安妮愿意留下来，那没有人比她更合适，更能干了。”","“Then it is settled, Musgrove,” cried Captain Wentworth, “that you stay, and that I take care of your sister home.But as to the rest, as to the others, if one stays to assist Mrs. Harville, I think it need be only one.Mrs. Charles Musgrove will, of course, wish to get back to her children; but if Anne will stay, no one so proper, so capable as Anne.”"
"安妮听到对自己的这番评价，心情十分激动。她停下脚步，想镇定一下。其他两个人齐声赞同温特沃思上校的意见，这时安妮才走上前去。","She paused a moment to recover from the emotion of hearing herself so spoken of.The other two warmly agreed with what he said, and she then appeared."
"“你一定愿意留下的，我可以肯定。你愿意留下看护她的，”温特沃思上校转身朝她大声说的时候虽很激动，但是态度很温和，仿佛恢复了旧日的友情。安妮满脸通红。温特沃思上校控制住自己的感情，走了开去。安妮表示她自己非常愿意留下，而且早就准备留下，很高兴留下。“她就是这么想的，希望大家能让她留下。她在路易莎房间的地板上搭个地铺就可以了，只要哈维尔太太愿意就行。”","“You will stay, I am sure; you will stay and nurse her;” cried he, turning to her and speaking with a glow, and yet a gentleness, which seemed almost restoring the past.She coloured deeply, and he recollected himself and moved away.She expressed herself most willing, ready, happy to remain.“It was what she had been thinking of, and wishing to be allowed to do.A bed on the floor in Louisa’s room would be sufficient for her, if Mrs. Harville would but think so.”"
"再办一件事情，一切似乎都安排就绪了。虽然稍稍迟一些回去比较理想，因为这样一来，马斯格罗夫先生和太太就会预感到情况不妙。但是他们乘坐阿珀克罗斯的马车回去，需要的时间会大大延长二老的焦虑。因此，温特沃思上校提出，他最好是从旅馆借一辆轻便马车，把马斯格罗夫先生的车马留下，明天一早再派人送回家。这样做的另一个好处是可以把当天晚上路易莎的情况捎回去。查尔斯•马斯格罗夫同意这一办法。","One thing more, and all seemed arranged.Though it was rather desirable that Mr. and Mrs. Musgrove should be previously alarmed by some share of delay; yet the time required by the Uppercross horses to take them back, would be a dreadful extension of suspense; and Captain Wentworth proposed, and Charles Musgrove agreed, that it would be much better for him to take a chaise from the inn, and leave Mr. Musgrove’s carriage and horses to be sent home the next morning early, when there would be the farther advantage of sending an account of Louisa’s night."
"这时，温温特沃思上校忙着出去做自己的准备工作，过一会儿再同两位女士汇合。可是当人们把这一计划告诉玛丽时，她一听就吵个不停。她很沮丧，言辞激烈，大声抱怨说，让她回去而把安妮留下是不公平的。安妮跟路易莎什么关系都不是，而她是路易莎的嫂嫂，最有权利代替亨里埃塔留下！她为什么不能像安妮一样有用呢？再说，她回家时还得撇下她的丈夫查尔斯！不，这太不尽人情了。总之，她说了一通，她的丈夫简直招架不住。既然她丈夫无能为力，其他人更不便反对了。结果，不得不让安妮替换玛丽。","Captain Wentworth now hurried off to get everything ready on his part, and to be soon followed by the two ladies.When the plan was made known to Mary, however, there was an end of all peace in it.She was so wretched and so vehement, complained so much of injustice in being expected to go away instead of Anne; Anne, who was nothing to Louisa, while she was her sister, and had the best right to stay in Henrietta’s stead!Why was not she to be as useful as Anne?And to go home without Charles, too, without her husband!No, it was too unkind.And in short, she said more than her husband could long withstand, and as none of the others could oppose when he gave way, there was no help for it; the change of Mary for Anne was inevitable."
"对于玛丽这一愚蠢而嫉妒的要求，安妮虽然顺从了，但是从来没有这么勉强，可是现在只能这么做了。于是他们一行就朝镇上走去，查尔斯照顾着他妹妹，本威克舰长照看着安妮。他们匆匆往前走的时候，安妮突然想起了今天早晨早些时候发生在同一地点的一些琐事。在这里她曾听到亨里埃塔要雪莉博士离开阿珀克罗斯的打算。后来，她第一次见到了埃利奥特，但是这些事情只是在安妮心中闪过了一下，因为眼下占据着她整个心灵的是路易莎和关心路易莎命运的人。","Anne had never submitted more reluctantly to the jealous and ill-judging claims of Mary; but so it must be, and they set off for the town, Charles taking care of his sister, and Captain Benwick attending to her.She gave a moment’s recollection, as they hurried along, to the little circumstances which the same spots had witnessed earlier in the morning.There she had listened to Henrietta’s schemes for Dr Shirley’s leaving Uppercross; farther on, she had first seen Mr. Elliot; a moment seemed all that could now be given to any one but Louisa, or those who were wrapt up in her welfare."
"本威克舰长对安妮非常体贴。这一天的灾难似乎把大家都联系在一起了。安妮觉得对他的好感在不断增加，她甚至还高兴地想到这也许是继续发展彼此间友谊的机会。","Captain Benwick was most considerately attentive to her; and, united as they all seemed by the distress of the day, she felt an increasing degree of good-will towards him, and a pleasure even in thinking that it might, perhaps, be the occasion of continuing their acquaintance."
"温特沃思上校正在等候她们，一辆轻便马车已经备好，停在街道的最低处，好让大家上车方便些。但是当他看到走过来的是姐姐而不是妹妹，显然感到非常惊讶和恼火。他一听查尔斯的解释，脸色顿时变了，目瞪口呆，想说什么又强压了下去，只是使对方不快地同安妮打了声招呼。或者至少使她觉得，自己被重视只是因为她对路易莎有用处。","Captain Wentworth was on the watch for them, and a chaise and four in waiting, stationed for their convenience in the lowest part of the street; but his evident surprise and vexation at the substitution of one sister for the other, the change in his countenance, the astonishment, the expressions begun and suppressed, with which Charles was listened to, made but a mortifying reception of Anne; or must at least convince her that she was valued only as she could be useful to Louisa."
"她尽力使自己心平气和，尽力公正地看待这一切。即使不去模仿埃玛对亨利的感情，但看在温特沃思上校的面子上，她也会以超乎寻常的热忱照看路易莎的。她希望温特沃思上校不要老是这么不公正地看待她，以为她会毫无必要地逃避一个朋友应尽的责任。","She endeavoured to be composed, and to be just.Without emulating the feelings of an Emma towards her Henry, she would have attended on Louisa with a zeal above the common claims of regard, for his sake; and she hoped he would not long be so unjust as to suppose she would shrink unnecessarily from the office of a friend."
"此时此刻，她已经上了马车。温特沃思上校把她们扶上车后，就坐在她们中间。于是就在这种情况下，安妮以满怀惊讶的心情离开了莱姆。她无法计算在路上要花多长时间，也无法估计这段路程会对他们的行程产生什么影响，更无法预计他们会在路上谈些什么。不过，一切都非常自然。他一心想着亨里埃塔，总是把脸转向她。他只要一说话，也总想着给亨里埃塔信心，给她鼓劲。总的来说，他的言谈举止都尽量平静。不让亨里埃塔忧虑似乎是他的主要原则。只有一次，当她为最后一次那失算的、倒霉的去科布散步感到伤心，后悔不该想这么个馊主意时，他好像再也忍受不住了，发作起来：","In the mean while she was in the carriage.He had handed them both in, and placed himself between them; and in this manner, under these circumstances, full of astonishment and emotion to Anne, she quitted Lyme.How the long stage would pass; how it was to affect their manners; what was to be their sort of intercourse, she could not foresee.It was all quite natural, however.He was devoted to Henrietta; always turning towards her; and when he spoke at all, always with the view of supporting her hopes and raising her spirits.In general, his voice and manner were studiously calm.To spare Henrietta from agitation seemed the governing principle.Once only, when she had been grieving over the last ill-judged, ill-fated walk to the Cobb, bitterly lamenting that it ever had been thought of, he burst forth, as if wholly overcome—"
"“不要再说那个了，不要再说了，”他大声嚷道，“上帝呀！但愿在那关键时刻我没有屈从她就好了！要是照我该做的去做就好了！但是她是那样地急切，那样的坚决！啊，可爱的路易莎！”","“Don’t talk of it, don’t talk of it,” he cried.“Oh God! that I had not given way to her at the fatal moment!Had I done as I ought!But so eager and so resolute!Dear, sweet Louisa!”"
"安妮心想，不知道他眼下有没有怀疑他先前关于性格坚定的人总会走运、总会得到好处的看法。不知道他有没有认识到，就像人的其他气质一样，坚定的性格也有个分寸与极限。她认为他不可能不感觉到，有时听从劝导的好脾气也会像坚定的性格一样，也有利于得到幸福。","Anne wondered whether it ever occurred to him now, to question the justness of his own previous opinion as to the universal felicity and advantage of firmness of character; and whether it might not strike him that, like all other qualities of the mind, it should have its proportions and limits.She thought it could scarcely escape him to feel that a persuadable temper might sometimes be as much in favour of happiness as a very resolute character."
"马车跑得很快。安妮惊讶这么快就看到了熟悉的山和熟悉的景物。马车的确跑得很快，加之他们对事情的结局怀着忐忑的心情，使得回去的路程看起来似乎比前天短了一半。不过，还没等他们来到阿珀克罗斯附近，天色已经很晚了，他们三个人沉默了好一会儿，亨里埃塔倚在车厢角落里，用一条披肩盖住自己的脸，希望哭一场后可以入睡。当马车驶上最后一个山岗时，安妮突然听见温特沃思上校在跟她说话。他用一种低沉，小心翼翼的声音说道：","They got on fast.Anne was astonished to recognise the same hills and the same objects so soon.Their actual speed, heightened by some dread of the conclusion, made the road appear but half as long as on the day before.It was growing quite dusk, however, before they were in the neighbourhood of Uppercross, and there had been total silence among them for some time, Henrietta leaning back in the corner, with a shawl over her face, giving the hope of her having cried herself to sleep; when, as they were going up their last hill, Anne found herself all at once addressed by Captain Wentworth.In a low, cautious voice, he said:—"
"“我一直在考虑我们怎么做最好。一开始她不能进屋去。她会受不了的。我一直在想你是不是最好先跟她在车上呆一会儿，我先进去跟马斯格罗夫先生太太说清楚。你觉得这个办法好吗？”","“I have been considering what we had best do.She must not appear at first.She could not stand it.I have been thinking whether you had not better remain in the carriage with her, while I go in and break it to Mr. and Mrs. Musgrove.Do you think this is a good plan?”"
"安妮认为可以，温特沃思上校觉得满意，他们就没再说什么。但是一想到他征求她的意见，安妮就感到很愉快，这是友谊的证明，也是对她判断力的尊重，这对她来说是一件非常高兴的事。即使这番话意味着他们将要分手，但也没有减弱它的价值。","She did: he was satisfied, and said no more.But the remembrance of the appeal remained a pleasure to her, as a proof of friendship, and of deference for her judgement, a great pleasure; and when it became a sort of parting proof, its value did not lessen."
"到阿珀克罗斯传达消息这一令人苦恼的差事完成了，温特沃思上校见到的路易莎的父母正像人们所希望的，他们表现得相当镇静，亨里埃塔同父母在一起，情绪上也安定了一些。温特沃思上校说他要乘坐同一辆马车返回莱姆。等马喂好，他就出发了。","When the distressing communication at Uppercross was over, and he had seen the father and mother quite as composed as could be hoped, and the daughter all the better for being with them, he announced his intention of returning in the same carriage to Lyme; and when the horses were baited, he was off."
"（第一卷完）","(End of volume one.)"
"第十三章","CHAPTER 13"
"安妮在阿珀克罗斯的时间只有两天了，她完全是在老宅里度过的。她满意地发现，她在这个家族里能起到极大的作用，既是一个近在眼前的伴侣，又是一个安排今后各项家务的能手，因为马斯格罗夫先生与太太正处于痛苦之中，要安排这些事情就难了。","The remainder of Anne’s time at Uppercross, comprehending only two days, was spent entirely at the Mansion House; and she had the satisfaction of knowing herself extremely useful there, both as an immediate companion, and as assisting in all those arrangements for the future, which, in Mr. and Mrs. Musgrove’s distressed state of spirits, would have been difficulties."
"第二天清早，他们就得到了从莱姆传来的消息。路易莎病情依旧。没有恶化的症状。几个小时以后，查尔斯带来了较为详尽的最新消息。他倒挺乐观的。虽然不能希望马上把病治好，但是从种种迹象来看，情况还是这种病例中最好的。说到哈维尔夫妇，他对他们的关照似乎有说不尽的感激，特别是对哈维尔太太尽心尽力的护理。“她什么事也不留给玛丽干。昨天晚上她还劝我和玛丽早些回旅馆休息。今天早晨玛丽又歇斯底里地发作了。我出来时，她正要同本威克舰长出去散步，我希望这对她有好处。我前一天要是能说服玛丽回家就好了。但是事实上，哈维尔太太没有留下任何事情让别人做。”","They had an early account from Lyme the next morning.Louisa was much the same.No symptoms worse than before had appeared.Charles came a few hours afterwards, to bring a later and more particular account.He was tolerably cheerful.A speedy cure must not be hoped, but everything was going on as well as the nature of the case admitted.In speaking of the Harvilles, he seemed unable to satisfy his own sense of their kindness, especially of Mrs. Harville’s exertions as a nurse.“She really left nothing for Mary to do.He and Mary had been persuaded to go early to their inn last night.Mary had been hysterical again this morning.When he came away, she was going to walk out with Captain Benwick, which, he hoped, would do her good.He almost wished she had been prevailed on to come home the day before; but the truth was, that Mrs. Harville left nothing for anybody to do.”"
"查尔斯当天下午要回莱姆去，起初他父亲有点想同他一起去，但是几位女士不赞同。那样只会给别人增添麻烦，他自己也会更难过。接着大家想出了一个更好的方案，并且照此办理。他们从克鲁克恩要了一辆两轮轻便马车，查尔斯带回来一个很有用的人，她是这家的老保姆，家里所有的孩子都是她带大的，并眼看着最小的、玩心重的、最受宠的哈里少爷跟着哥哥去上了学。她现在住在空荡荡的婴儿室里，补补袜子，给周围的人治治脓包和伤口，因此一听说让她来照顾亲爱的路易莎小姐，她当然非常高兴。马斯格罗夫太太和亨里埃塔以前也曾隐隐感到要把萨拉送到那里去帮忙。但是，要是没有安妮，她们很难做出这样的决定并很快发现这一决定切实可行。","Charles was to return to Lyme the same afternoon, and his father had at first half a mind to go with him, but the ladies could not consent.It would be going only to multiply trouble to the others, and increase his own distress; and a much better scheme followed and was acted upon.A chaise was sent for from Crewkherne, and Charles conveyed back a far more useful person in the old nursery-maid of the family, one who having brought up all the children, and seen the very last, the lingering and long-petted Master Harry, sent to school after his brothers, was now living in her deserted nursery to mend stockings and dress all the blains and bruises she could get near her, and who, consequently, was only too happy in being allowed to go and help nurse dear Miss Louisa.Vague wishes of getting Sarah thither, had occurred before to Mrs. Musgrove and Henrietta; but without Anne, it would hardly have been resolved on, and found practicable so soon."
"第二天，多亏了查尔斯•海特，他们了解到路易莎的详细情况，每24个小时就得到一次这样的消息，确实非常重要。他把去莱姆的事情当作己任，而且他带来的消息仍然是令人鼓舞的。他说路易莎神志清醒的时间越来越长，这一点越来越明显了。人们都说，温特沃思上校要在莱姆长住了。","They were indebted, the next day, to Charles Hayter, for all the minute knowledge of Louisa, which it was so essential to obtain every twenty-four hours.He made it his business to go to Lyme, and his account was still encouraging.The intervals of sense and consciousness were believed to be stronger.Every report agreed in Captain Wentworth’s appearing fixed in Lyme."
"安妮明天就离开他们了，这是大家都担心的问题。“没有她，我们该怎么办？我们之间谁也安慰不了谁。”这种话大家说了好多，安妮觉得她只好帮大家挑明他们心中的共同心愿，动员他们马上就去莱姆。她没费多少唇舌，大家当即决定就要去。第二天就去，或者住进旅馆，或者住进公寓，怎么合适怎么住，直到亲爱的路易莎能够走动为止。他们一定能为照看路易莎的那些好心人减轻些负担。至少可以帮助哈维尔太太照顾一下她的孩子。总之，他们对这一决定感到高兴，安妮也为自己提出这个建议感到高兴。她为他们打点行李，一早送他们上路，觉得这是打发她在阿珀克罗斯最后一个上午的最好办法，然而她这么做的结果是自己孤零零地留在这个冷冷清清的家中。","Anne was to leave them on the morrow, an event which they all dreaded.“What should they do without her?They were wretched comforters for one another.”And so much was said in this way, that Anne thought she could not do better than impart among them the general inclination to which she was privy, and persuaded them all to go to Lyme at once.She had little difficulty; it was soon determined that they would go; go to-morrow, fix themselves at the inn, or get into lodgings, as it suited, and there remain till dear Louisa could be moved.They must be taking off some trouble from the good people she was with; they might at least relieve Mrs. Harville from the care of her own children; and in short, they were so happy in the decision, that Anne was delighted with what she had done, and felt that she could not spend her last morning at Uppercross better than in assisting their preparations, and sending them off at an early hour, though her being left to the solitary range of the house was the consequence."
"除了庄上的两个小男孩以外，在那些曾经使这两处房子充满生气、为阿珀克罗斯带来欢声笑语的人中，安妮是留下来的最后一个人。几天功夫，这里就发生了巨大的变化！","She was the last, excepting the little boys at the cottage, she was the very last, the only remaining one of all that had filled and animated both houses, of all that had given Uppercross its cheerful character.A few days had made a change indeed!"
"要是路易莎痊愈了，一切又都会好起来的。这里会比以前更加欢乐。对路易莎康复之后出现的情况，安妮确信无疑。现在这里的情况这么凄凉，只有她一个人在默默地沉思。但是几个月以后，这里就可能又会充满幸福与欢乐，充满丰饶的爱情带来的灿烂景象，一切都与安妮•埃利奥特的情况完全不同。","If Louisa recovered, it would all be well again.More than former happiness would be restored.There could not be a doubt, to her mind there was none, of what would follow her recovery.A few months hence, and the room now so deserted, occupied but by her silent, pensive self, might be filled again with all that was happy and gay, all that was glowing and bright in prosperous love, all that was most unlike Anne Elliot!"
"11月阴暗的一天，蒙蒙细雨似乎遮住了原来在窗口依稀可见的景色，整整一个小时无所事事的遐想，使得拉塞尔夫人的车轮声更受欢迎。然而，尽管安妮很想走，但她离开老宅时，在临别前眺望庄上那湿漉漉的凄清黑阳台时，甚至通过朦胧的玻璃看村子尽头的几处简屋时，心中不禁感到十分悲伤。在阿珀克罗斯经历的一切，使她觉得这里特别珍贵。这里记载了很多痛苦的经历，这些痛苦一度是强烈的，但现在已经缓和了许多；这里记载了一些和解的感情、微弱的友谊和谅解，这一切再也觅不到了，但永远都会那么亲切。她把这一切的一切都留在这里了，剩下的只是对往事的回忆。","An hour’s complete leisure for such reflections as these, on a dark November day, a small thick rain almost blotting out the very few objects ever to be discerned from the windows, was enough to make the sound of Lady Russell’s carriage exceedingly welcome; and yet, though desirous to be gone, she could not quit the Mansion House, or look an adieu to the Cottage, with its black, dripping and comfortless veranda, or even notice through the misty glasses the last humble tenements of the village, without a saddened heart.Scenes had passed in Uppercross which made it precious.It stood the record of many sensations of pain, once severe, but now softened; and of some instances of relenting feeling, some breathings of friendship and reconciliation, which could never be looked for again, and which could never cease to be dear.She left it all behind her, all but the recollection that such things had been."
"安妮自从9月离开拉塞尔夫人家以后，再也没有进入过凯林奇。没有这个必要，有几次她本可以到凯林奇府去的，但她都设法避开了。她这头一次回来就要在这套公寓现代而别致的房间里住下来，好给女主人增添点快乐。","Anne had never entered Kellynch since her quitting Lady Russell’s house in September.It had not been necessary, and the few occasions of its being possible for her to go to the Hall she had contrived to evade and escape from.Her first return was to resume her place in the modern and elegant apartments of the Lodge, and to gladden the eyes of its mistress."
"拉塞尔夫人见到安妮，欣喜之中还掺杂着几分忧虑。她明白谁常去阿珀克罗斯。但是幸运的是，要么安妮变得更丰润更漂亮了，要么拉塞尔夫人认为她如此。安妮听到拉塞尔夫人的这番赞美，心中不无回味地把这些话同她堂兄默默的爱慕联系了起来，从而希望自己拥有青春与美丽的第二个春天。","There was some anxiety mixed with Lady Russell’s joy in meeting her.She knew who had been frequenting Uppercross.But happily, either Anne was improved in plumpness and looks, or Lady Russell fancied her so; and Anne, in receiving her compliments on the occasion, had the amusement of connecting them with the silent admiration of her cousin, and of hoping that she was to be blessed with a second spring of youth and beauty."
"她们一开始聊天，安妮就觉察到了自己思想上的一些变化。她在离开凯林奇时萦绕在心头的一些事情，在马斯格罗夫家中没有得到重视，当时她不得不将它们深深地埋在心底。现在这些事已经落到了次要的位置。近来她甚至忘记了自己的父亲、姐姐和巴斯。她对他们的关心已经被阿珀克罗斯的一切淹没了。拉塞尔夫人谈起她们以前的那些希望和忧虑，谈到她对他们在卡姆登巷租下的房子感到满意，但对克莱太太还跟他们住在一起感到遗憾。安妮不好意思让拉塞尔夫人知道，她考虑得更多的是莱姆、路易莎和她在那里的所有熟人。对她来说，哈维尔夫妇和本威克舰长的家以及他们的友谊要比她父亲在卡姆登的房子或者她姐姐同克莱太太的亲近更有意思。她实际上是硬让自己去附和拉塞尔夫人，在她本该最关心的话题上表现出同样的焦虑。","When they came to converse, she was soon sensible of some mental change.The subjects of which her heart had been full on leaving Kellynch, and which she had felt slighted, and been compelled to smother among the Musgroves, were now become but of secondary interest.She had lately lost sight even of her father and sister and Bath.Their concerns had been sunk under those of Uppercross; and when Lady Russell reverted to their former hopes and fears, and spoke her satisfaction in the house in Camden Place, which had been taken, and her regret that Mrs. Clay should still be with them, Anne would have been ashamed to have it known how much more she was thinking of Lyme and Louisa Musgrove, and all her acquaintance there; how much more interesting to her was the home and the friendship of the Harvilles and Captain Benwick, than her own father’s house in Camden Place, or her own sister’s intimacy with Mrs. Clay.She was actually forced to exert herself to meet Lady Russell with anything like the appearance of equal solicitude, on topics which had by nature the first claim on her."
"她们在谈起另外一个话题时，起初有点尴尬。她们必然要谈起莱姆的那场事故。拉塞尔夫人前一天刚回来不到五分钟，就有人把整个事情原原本本地告诉了她。但是这件事情还得谈一谈，拉塞尔夫人一定会提问题，一定会对那个轻率的行为表示遗憾，对事情的结果表示惋惜，她们一定会提起温特沃思上校的名字。安妮觉得她自己不如拉塞尔夫人坦然。她说不出他的名字，不敢直视拉塞尔夫人的目光，后来干脆采取权宜之计，谈起了她自己对温特沃思上校和路易莎之间感情的看法。说出这件事后，安妮在提到温特沃思上校时就不再感到不安了。","There was a little awkwardness at first in their discourse on another subject.They must speak of the accident at Lyme.Lady Russell had not been arrived five minutes the day before, when a full account of the whole had burst on her; but still it must be talked of, she must make enquiries, she must regret the imprudence, lament the result, and Captain Wentworth’s name must be mentioned by both.Anne was conscious of not doing it so well as Lady Russell.She could not speak the name, and look straight forward to Lady Russell’s eye, till she had adopted the expedient of telling her briefly what she thought of the attachment between him and Louisa.When this was told, his name distressed her no longer."
"拉塞尔夫人安静地听着，并希望那一对年轻人幸福，但是内心里却感到既气愤又得意，既高兴又鄙视，觉得这个人在23岁时看起来还多少懂得安妮•埃利奥特的价值，可是八年之后居然被一位马斯格罗夫小姐迷住了。","Lady Russell had only to listen composedly, and wish them happy, but internally her heart revelled in angry pleasure, in pleased contempt, that the man who at twenty-three had seemed to understand somewhat of the value of an Anne Elliot, should, eight years afterwards, be charmed by a Louisa Musgrove."
"最初的三四天，一切都很平静，没出现什么特别的情况，只是他们收到了从莱姆来的一两封短信，安妮也弄不清送信的人怎么知道她现在的地址，竟能把信送到。这些信带来了路易莎大为好转的消息。过了几天，拉塞尔夫人感到不能置礼节于不顾了，过去自我恐吓的心理也已经减弱，她坚决地说：“我得去拜访克罗夫特太太。我的确应该尽快去拜访她。安妮，你有勇气陪我去那所房子里拜访吗？这对我们两个人都将是一种考验。”","The first three or four days passed most quietly, with no circumstance to mark them excepting the receipt of a note or two from Lyme, which found their way to Anne, she could not tell how, and brought a rather improving account of Louisa.At the end of that period, Lady Russell’s politeness could repose no longer, and the fainter self-threatenings of the past became in a decided tone, “I must call on Mrs. Croft; I really must call upon her soon.Anne, have you courage to go with me, and pay a visit in that house?It will be some trial to us both.”"
"安妮对此丝毫没有退缩，相反，她心里想的跟她嘴上说的一样：","Anne did not shrink from it; on the contrary, she truly felt as she said, in observing—"
"“我想，你可能是我们两个中较痛苦的一个。你的感情不像我这样能适应这种变化。我一直呆在这附近，我已经习惯了。”","“I think you are very likely to suffer the most of the two; your feelings are less reconciled to the change than mine.By remaining in the neighbourhood, I am become inured to it.”"
"她本来可以就此再多说几句，因为她事实上非常尊重克罗夫特夫妇，认为她父亲有这样的房客十分幸运，觉得教区有个好榜样，穷人会得到极好的照顾与救济。她家不得已搬走了，她不管感到多么遗憾和羞愧，但是从良心上说，没有资格留下的人走了，凯林奇府转到了比它的主人更适合的人手中。这些想法无疑是令人痛苦的，而且非常痛苦。但是它们使安妮不会有拉塞尔夫人重新走进这幢房子，重新走过熟悉的房间的那种痛苦。","She could have said more on the subject; for she had in fact so high an opinion of the Crofts, and considered her father so very fortunate in his tenants, felt the parish to be so sure of a good example, and the poor of the best attention and relief, that however sorry and ashamed for the necessity of the removal, she could not but in conscience feel that they were gone who deserved not to stay, and that Kellynch Hall had passed into better hands than its owners’.These convictions must unquestionably have their own pain, and severe was its kind; but they precluded that pain which Lady Russell would suffer in entering the house again, and returning through the well-known apartments."
"在这样的时刻，安妮无法对自己说：“这些房间应该只属于我们。啊，它们的命运多么悲惨！现在被不相称的人住上了！一个名门世家就这样被赶走了！一些陌生人把这儿占据了！”不，只要她不想起自己的母亲，不想起母亲曾经坐在那里掌管家务，她就不会发出这样的叹息。","In such moments Anne had no power of saying to herself, “These rooms ought to belong only to us.Oh, how fallen in their destination!How unworthily occupied!An ancient family to be so driven away!Strangers filling their place!”No, except when she thought of her mother, and remembered where she had been used to sit and preside, she had no sigh of that description to heave."
"克罗夫特太太对她一直都非常和蔼可亲，这使她很高兴，觉得克罗夫特太太喜欢她。这次克罗夫特太太是在凯林奇接待她，对她更是关怀备至。","Mrs. Croft always met her with a kindness which gave her the pleasure of fancying herself a favourite, and on the present occasion, receiving her in that house, there was particular attention."
"发生在莱姆的那件不幸事件很快就成了大家的话题。她们在交换病人的最新消息时，发现两人得到的消息是昨天上午同一时间的情况。原来，温特沃思上校昨天来到了凯林奇（这是出事以后的第一次），并给她送来她先前不知道怎么送到她手中的最近的一封短信。他在这里呆了几个小时，然后又返回莱姆，目前不打算再离开那里了。安妮发现，他还专门问起过她。希望埃利奥特小姐没有累坏身体，还说那次安妮出了很多力。这真宽宏大度，没有什么比这能给她带来更多的快乐。","The sad accident at Lyme was soon the prevailing topic, and on comparing their latest accounts of the invalid, it appeared that each lady dated her intelligence from the same hour of yestermorn; that Captain Wentworth had been in Kellynch yesterday (the first time since the accident), had brought Anne the last note, which she had not been able to trace the exact steps of; had staid a few hours and then returned again to Lyme, and without any present intention of quitting it any more.He had enquired after her, she found, particularly; had expressed his hope of Miss Elliot’s not being the worse for her exertions, and had spoken of those exertions as great.This was handsome, and gave her more pleasure than almost anything else could have done."
"对于那次倒霉的事故，两位稳重理智的女士只能根据事实判断。她们完全肯定，这是由于过分轻率和鲁莽造成的。并且后果非常严重，而且一想到不知多久马斯格罗夫小姐才能复原，一想到这次震动可能会给她留下后遗症，就叫人害怕！将军对此作了一个简短的总结：","As to the sad catastrophe itself, it could be canvassed only in one style by a couple of steady, sensible women, whose judgements had to work on ascertained events; and it was perfectly decided that it had been the consequence of much thoughtlessness and much imprudence; that its effects were most alarming, and that it was frightful to think, how long Miss Musgrove’s recovery might yet be doubtful, and how liable she would still remain to suffer from the concussion hereafter!The Admiral wound it up summarily by exclaiming—"
"“嗯，这确实很糟糕。年轻人用砸破情人脑袋的办法来求爱，这难道是一种新式恋爱法，对吗，埃利奥特小姐？这真是叫摔破脑袋再上膏药啊！”","“Ay, a very bad business indeed.A new sort of way this, for a young fellow to be making love, by breaking his mistress’s head, is not it, Miss Elliot?This is breaking a head and giving a plaster, truly!”"
"克罗夫特将军的态度不太合拉塞尔夫人的意，但让安妮感到很高兴。他那善良的心地和朴实的性格叫人不由得受其吸引。","Admiral Croft’s manners were not quite of the tone to suit Lady Russell, but they delighted Anne.His goodness of heart and simplicity of character were irresistible."
"“不过，你一定很难过，”他沉思了一会儿，突然回过神来说，“让你上这儿来，看到我们住在这里。我以前没有想到这一点，不过，你一定觉得不好受。不过现在，你不要客气。你要是愿意的话，请起来到所有的房间里看一看吧。”","“Now, this must be very bad for you,” said he, suddenly rousing from a little reverie, “to be coming and finding us here.I had not recollected it before, I declare, but it must be very bad.But now, do not stand upon ceremony.Get up and go over all the rooms in the house if you like it.”"
"“下次吧，先生，谢谢您，这次不看了。”","“Another time, Sir, I thank you, not now.”"
"“好吧，你什么时候方便就请过来。你随时可以从灌木丛穿过来。你会发现，我们的雨伞就放在那里，挂在那扇门旁边。这地方不错，对吧？不过，”（停了一会儿），“你会觉得这地方不怎么样，因为你们的雨伞总是放在管家的房里。”哦，我想，情况总是这样。一个人的做事方式可能同另一个人一样好，可是大家更喜欢自己的做事方式。所以你得自己拿主意，是到处走走好呢，还是留在这儿好。","“Well, whenever it suits you.You can slip in from the shrubbery at any time; and there you will find we keep our umbrellas hanging up by that door.A good place is not it?But,” (checking himself), “you will not think it a good place, for yours were always kept in the butler’s room.Ay, so it always is, I believe.One man’s ways may be as good as another’s, but we all like our own best.And so you must judge for yourself, whether it would be better for you to go about the house or not.”"
"安妮发现她还是可以谢绝的，便这样做了，对此她十分感激。","Anne, finding she might decline it, did so, very gratefully."
"“我们也没有多大的变动，”将军想了一会儿接着说，“很少。我们在阿珀克罗斯同你谈起过洗衣房的那扇门。那是个很大的改进。那扇门以前这么长时间开关多不方便，奇怪的是人们竟能忍受这么久！你可以把我们重新装修的情况告诉沃尔特爵士，还可以告诉他，谢泼德先生认为那是这幢房子里最了不起的改进。真的，我也该为我们说句公道话，我们做的少量变动都不错。不过，这应该归功于我的妻子。我只做了一点事情，只是搬走了更衣室里的几面大镜子，那些东西是你父亲的。他是个好人，我认为他是典型的绅士。不过，我觉得，埃利奥特小姐，”（他带着深思的神情看一看），“我觉得，就他这样的年纪而言，他真可以算是一个讲究穿戴的男士。这么多穿衣镜！天哪！哪儿也躲不开自己的影子。于是我找索菲来帮忙，很快就把那些镜子搬走了。现在我就舒服多了，刮胡子的小镜子放在角落里，还有一面大镜子，但我从来没有接近它。”","“We have made very few changes either,” continued the Admiral, after thinking a moment.“Very few.We told you about the laundry-door, at Uppercross.That has been a very great improvement.The wonder was, how any family upon earth could bear with the inconvenience of its opening as it did, so long!You will tell Sir Walter what we have done, and that Mr. Shepherd thinks it the greatest improvement the house ever had.Indeed, I must do ourselves the justice to say, that the few alterations we have made have been all very much for the better.My wife should have the credit of them, however.I have done very little besides sending away some of the large looking-glasses from my dressing-room, which was your father’s.A very good man, and very much the gentleman I am sure: but I should think, Miss Elliot,” (looking with serious reflection), “I should think he must be rather a dressy man for his time of life.Such a number of looking-glasses!oh Lord!there was no getting away from one’s self.So I got Sophy to lend me a hand, and we soon shifted their quarters; and now I am quite snug, with my little shaving glass in one corner, and another great thing that I never go near.”"
"安妮不禁觉得这番话非常有趣，但又苦恼不知回答什么是好。而将军担心自己不够礼貌，接着话头又说下去：","Anne, amused in spite of herself, was rather distressed for an answer, and the Admiral, fearing he might not have been civil enough, took up the subject again, to say—"
"“你下次给你父亲写信时，埃利奥特小姐，请替我和克罗夫特太太向他问好。请告诉他，我们很喜欢住在这里，对这里挑不出任何毛病。虽说早餐室里的烟囱有点漏洞，可那只是刮南风，而且刮得很厉害的时候，一冬也许碰不上三次。总的来说，我们看过了附近的大多数房子，可以断定，我们最喜欢的是你们这一家。请你如实地告诉他，并再次替我问候他。他听到这些会很高兴的。”","“The next time you write to your good father, Miss Elliot, pray give him my compliments and Mrs. Croft’s, and say that we are settled here quite to our liking, and have no fault at all to find with the place.The breakfast-room chimney smokes a little, I grant you, but it is only when the wind is due north and blows hard, which may not happen three times a winter.And take it altogether, now that we have been into most of the houses hereabouts and can judge, there is not one that we like better than this.Pray say so, with my compliments.He will be glad to hear it.”"
"拉塞尔夫人和克罗夫特太太对彼此都非常满意。但在当时，这次访问所开始的交往肯定还不能进一步发展，因为克罗夫特夫妇来回访时就说，他们打算出门几个星期，去拜访住在该郡北部的亲戚，也许在拉塞尔夫人去巴斯以前还不能回来。","Lady Russell and Mrs. Croft were very well pleased with each other: but the acquaintance which this visit began was fated not to proceed far at present; for when it was returned, the Crofts announced themselves to be going away for a few weeks, to visit their connexions in the north of the county, and probably might not be at home again before Lady Russell would be removing to Bath."
"于是，安妮就不用担心在凯林奇府碰见温特沃思上校了，也不必担心看到他跟她的朋友在一起。一切都令人非常放心，安妮一想起以前的种种担忧都是白费心思，不禁觉得好笑。","So ended all danger to Anne of meeting Captain Wentworth at Kellynch Hall, or of seeing him in company with her friend.Everything was safe enough, and she smiled over the many anxious feelings she had wasted on the subject."
"第十四章","CHAPTER 14"
"马斯格罗夫先生和太太到了莱姆以后，查尔斯和玛丽还在那里住了一阵子。安妮认为他们根本不需要在那里住那么久。不过，他们还算是一家中回来得最早的一批。他们一回到阿珀克罗斯，很快就来到拉塞尔夫人的寓所。他们离开莱姆时，路易莎已经可以坐起来了，不过她头脑虽然清醒了，身体还非常虚弱。她神经脆弱，还需要非常精心的照料。尽管可以认为她总的来说很好，但仍然说不准她哪一天可以经得起归家旅途的颠簸。即使在她父母及时回来迎接几个年幼子女回家过圣诞节时，也不见得有希望能够把她接回家来。","Though Charles and Mary had remained at Lyme much longer after Mr. and Mrs. Musgrove’s going than Anne conceived they could have been at all wanted, they were yet the first of the family to be at home again; and as soon as possible after their return to Uppercross they drove over to the Lodge.They had left Louisa beginning to sit up; but her head, though clear, was exceedingly weak, and her nerves susceptible to the highest extreme of tenderness; and though she might be pronounced to be altogether doing very well, it was still impossible to say when she might be able to bear the removal home; and her father and mother, who must return in time to receive their younger children for the Christmas holidays, had hardly a hope of being allowed to bring her with them."
"他们大家都住在公寓里。马斯格罗夫太太尽量把哈维尔太太的孩子领开，尽量从阿珀克罗斯运去了能供应的一切用品，为的是减轻给哈维尔夫妇带来的不便，而哈维尔夫妇则坚持要他们天天去他们那里吃晚饭。总之，双方似乎一直在比赛，看哪一方更为大方和好客。","They had been all in lodgings together.Mrs. Musgrove had got Mrs. Harville’s children away as much as she could, every possible supply from Uppercross had been furnished, to lighten the inconvenience to the Harvilles, while the Harvilles had been wanting them to come to dinner every day; and in short, it seemed to have been only a struggle on each side as to which should be most disinterested and hospitable."
"玛丽也有自己的苦恼。但总的来说，既然她在莱姆呆了那么久，显然她觉得愉快是多于痛苦的。查尔斯去莱姆的次数太多，使玛丽感到不愉快。他们到哈维尔夫妇家去吃饭时，只有一名女仆侍候他们。最初，哈维尔太太总是让马斯格罗夫太太坐上座，但是后来她得知玛丽是谁的女儿后，就非常客气地向玛丽表示歉意。玛丽也就成天来来回回，在他们的公寓和哈维尔夫妇家之间来回时又常可以散散步，还经常到图书馆借书和还书，所以玛丽当然就倾向于莱姆了。他们还带她去了查茅斯，她在那里游泳，上教堂做礼拜，在莱姆的教堂里看到的人比在阿珀克罗斯教堂看到的多得多。这一切再加上玛丽自以为在那里给别人帮了很多忙，确实使玛丽觉得这两周过得非常愉快。","Mary had had her evils; but upon the whole, as was evident by her staying so long, she had found more to enjoy than to suffer.Charles Hayter had been at Lyme oftener than suited her; and when they dined with the Harvilles there had been only a maid-servant to wait, and at first Mrs. Harville had always given Mrs. Musgrove precedence; but then, she had received so very handsome an apology from her on finding out whose daughter she was, and there had been so much going on every day, there had been so many walks between their lodgings and the Harvilles, and she had got books from the library, and changed them so often, that the balance had certainly been much in favour of Lyme.She had been taken to Charmouth too, and she had bathed, and she had gone to church, and there were a great many more people to look at in the church at Lyme than at Uppercross; and all this, joined to the sense of being so very useful, had made really an agreeable fortnight."
"安妮问起了本威克舰长，玛丽的脸接着就沉下来了。查尔斯却笑了。","Anne enquired after Captain Benwick, Mary’s face was clouded directly.Charles laughed."
"“噢！我想本威克舰长的情况很好，但是他是一个非常古怪的年轻人。我不知道他想干什么。我们请他到我们家来一两天，查尔斯答应陪他去打猎，他看上去很高兴，而我呢，以为一切事情都已经定下来了。可是，你瞧！到了星期二的晚上，他找了个十分勉强的理由，说‘他从未打过猎’，说‘我们误解他了’，他还说已经答应了这样那样的事情，结果我发现他根本不想来。我想他是怕这里无聊。不过说真的，我认为，对于本威克舰长这样一个心碎的人来说，我们庄上的生活够活跃了。”","“Oh!Captain Benwick is very well, I believe, but he is a very odd young man.I do not know what he would be at.We asked him to come home with us for a day or two: Charles undertook to give him some shooting, and he seemed quite delighted, and, for my part, I thought it was all settled; when behold!on Tuesday night, he made a very awkward sort of excuse; ‘he never shot’ and he had ‘been quite misunderstood,’ and he had promised this and he had promised that, and the end of it was, I found, that he did not mean to come.I suppose he was afraid of finding it dull; but upon my word I should have thought we were lively enough at the Cottage for such a heart-broken man as Captain Benwick.”"
"查尔斯又笑了，说道：“现在玛丽非常明白这究竟是怎么一回事了。这全都是因为你。”（他转向安妮。）“他原以为，要是他同我们一起来，他会遇到你，他以为每个人都住在阿珀克罗斯。当他发现拉塞尔夫人家住在三英里以外时，他便泄了气，没有勇气来了。我以名誉担保，这就是事情的原委，玛丽是知道的。”","Charles laughed again and said, “Now Mary, you know very well how it really was.It was all your doing,” (turning to Anne.)“He fancied that if he went with us, he should find you close by: he fancied everybody to be living in Uppercross; and when he discovered that Lady Russell lived three miles off, his heart failed him, and he had not courage to come.That is the fact, upon my honour, Mary knows it is.”"
"但是玛丽并没有欣然地承认这一点，究竟是因为她认为本威克舰长的出身和地位配不上埃利奥特家的小姐，还是她不愿意相信安妮比她更能把别人吸引到阿珀克罗斯来，那就不得而知了。然而安妮的好意并没有因为听到这些话而削弱。她大胆地承认她听到这些话很荣幸，并且她还继续打听情况。","But Mary did not give into it very graciously, whether from not considering Captain Benwick entitled by birth and situation to be in love with an Elliot, or from not wanting to believe Anne a greater attraction to Uppercross than herself, must be left to be guessed.Anne’s good-will, however, was not to be lessened by what she heard.She boldly acknowledged herself flattered, and continued her enquiries."
"“啊！他经常谈起你，”查尔斯高声说，“听那措词——”玛丽打断了他。“我说，查尔斯，我在那里呆了这么久，从没听他提到过安妮两次。我敢说，安妮，他从来没有谈起过你。”","“Oh! he talks of you,” cried Charles, “in such terms—” Mary interrupted him.“I declare, Charles, I never heard him mention Anne twice all the time I was there.I declare, Anne, he never talks of you at all.”"
"“不，”查尔斯承认，“我知道他从不泛泛地谈一通。但是很明显，他十分钦佩你。他脑子里装得满是你推荐给他的书，他还想跟你讨论一下读书心得。他在某一本书里发现了什么问题，他认为——哦！到底说的是什么我已忘了，这我不可能假装，反正说得十分精彩——我听见他同亨里埃塔谈论过这些，而且是用十分崇敬的口气提起‘埃利奥特小姐’！好了，玛丽，我想情况就是这样。这是当你在另一间屋子里时，我亲耳听见他说的。‘优雅、可爱、美丽。’哦！埃利奥特小姐有无穷无尽的魅力。”","“No,” admitted Charles, “I do not know that he ever does, in a general way; but however, it is a very clear thing that he admires you exceedingly.His head is full of some books that he is reading upon your recommendation, and he wants to talk to you about them; he has found out something or other in one of them which he thinks—oh!I cannot pretend to remember it, but it was something very fine—I overheard him telling Henrietta all about it; and then ‘Miss Elliot’ was spoken of in the highest terms!Now Mary, I declare it was so, I heard it myself, and you were in the other room.‘Elegance, sweetness, beauty.’ Oh! there was no end of Miss Elliot’s charms.”"
"“我可以肯定，”玛丽激动地大声嚷道，“他即使这么说过，也没有什么值得称道的。哈维尔小姐六月份才去世。这种人的爱才不稀罕呢。你说是吧，拉塞尔夫人？我知道你一定会同意我的看法。”","“And I am sure,” cried Mary, warmly, “it was a very little to his credit, if he did.Miss Harville only died last June.Such a heart is very little worth having; is it, Lady Russell?I am sure you will agree with me.”"
"“我要见到本威克舰长以后才能下结论。”拉塞尔夫人笑眯眯地说。","“I must see Captain Benwick before I decide,” said Lady Russell, smiling."
"“你大概很快就可以见到他，我可以告诉你，夫人，”查尔斯说。“尽管他没有勇气和我们一起来，随后也不敢再到这儿来进行正式访问，但是有朝一日他会单独来凯林奇的，这一点你相信我好了。我告诉了他距离和走法，我还告诉他，这里的教堂很值得一看，因为他喜欢这一类东西，我想这会是一个很好的借口，而且他已经心领神会。根据他的态度，我可以肯定他很快就会来这儿拜访。所以，我通知你了，拉塞尔夫人。”","“And that you are very likely to do very soon, I can tell you, ma’am,” said Charles.“Though he had not nerves for coming away with us, and setting off again afterwards to pay a formal visit here, he will make his way over to Kellynch one day by himself, you may depend on it.I told him the distance and the road, and I told him of the church’s being so very well worth seeing; for as he has a taste for those sort of things, I thought that would be a good excuse, and he listened with all his understanding and soul; and I am sure from his manner that you will have him calling here soon.So, I give you notice, Lady Russell.”"
"“安妮的任何朋友我都欢迎。”拉塞尔夫人和蔼地回答道。","“Any acquaintance of Anne’s will always be welcome to me,” was Lady Russell’s kind answer."
"“哦！说到安妮的朋友，”玛丽说道，“我觉得不如说是我的朋友，因为在过去的两个星期里我天天见到他。”","“Oh!as to being Anne’s acquaintance,” said Mary, “I think he is rather my acquaintance, for I have been seeing him every day this last fortnight.”"
"“好吧，既然你们都认识本威克舰长，那么我自然非常高兴见到他。”","“Well, as your joint acquaintance, then, I shall be very happy to see Captain Benwick.”"
"“你不会在他身上发现任何令人愉快的地方，我向你保证，夫人。他是世上最枯燥无味的年轻人。有时，他陪我从沙滩的一端走到另一端，却一声不吭。他根本不是一个有教养的年轻人。我敢肯定你不会喜欢他。”","“You will not find anything very agreeable in him, I assure you, ma’am.He is one of the dullest young men that ever lived.He has walked with me, sometimes, from one end of the sands to the other, without saying a word.He is not at all a well-bred young man.I am sure you will not like him.”"
"“在这一点上，我们的看法就不会一致了，玛丽。”安妮说道，“我认为拉塞尔夫人会喜欢他的。我认为拉塞尔夫人会非常喜欢他的见解，要不了多久，她就看不到他举止上的缺陷了。”","“There we differ, Mary,” said Anne.“I think Lady Russell would like him.I think she would be so much pleased with his mind, that she would very soon see no deficiency in his manner.”"
"“我也这么觉得，安妮，”查尔斯说道。“我肯定拉塞尔夫人会喜欢他的。他正是拉塞尔夫人喜欢的那种人。给他一本书，他会看上一整天。”","“So do I, Anne,” said Charles.“I am sure Lady Russell would like him.He is just Lady Russell’s sort.Give him a book, and he will read all day long.”"
"“对，他会这么做的！”玛丽大声地嘲讽道。“他会坐在那里一心一意地读书，有人跟他说话他也不知道，你把剪刀掉在地上他也不知道，不管出了什么事他都不知道。你们觉得拉塞尔夫人会喜欢这样的人吗？”","“Yes, that he will!” exclaimed Mary, tauntingly.“He will sit poring over his book, and not know when a person speaks to him, or when one drop’s one’s scissors, or anything that happens.Do you think Lady Russell would like that?”"
"拉塞尔夫人忍不住笑了。“我敢担保，”她说道，“我真没想到，我对一个人的看法竟会引起这么不同的猜测，我认为我是一个稳重而讲究实际的人。我确实非常好奇，想见见这么一个能引起截然不同看法的人。我希望你们能劝他到这里来。等他来了，玛丽，你肯定会知道我的看法的。不过在此之前，我决不会对他妄加评论的。”","Lady Russell could not help laughing.“Upon my word,” said she, “I should not have supposed that my opinion of any one could have admitted of such difference of conjecture, steady and matter of fact as I may call myself.I have really a curiosity to see the person who can give occasion to such directly opposite notions.I wish he may be induced to call here.And when he does, Mary, you may depend upon hearing my opinion; but I am determined not to judge him beforehand.”"
"“你不会喜欢他的，我敢担保。”","“You will not like him, I will answer for it.”"
"拉塞尔夫人开始谈起别的事情来。玛丽激动地谈起了他们偶然遇见，或者更确切地说，他们错过了与埃利奥特先生结识的机会这件事。","Lady Russell began talking of something else.Mary spoke with animation of their meeting with, or rather missing, Mr. Elliot so extraordinarily."
"“他这个人，”拉塞尔夫人说道，“我倒不想见他。他不愿意同他族长中的长辈真诚相处，所以给我留下了非常不好的印象。”","“He is a man,” said Lady Russell, “whom I have no wish to see.His declining to be on cordial terms with the head of his family, has left a very strong impression in his disfavour with me.”"
"这番坚决的话给心头热切的玛丽泼了一盆冷水，以至于她对埃利奥特相貌的议论说到一半就戛然而止了。","This decision checked Mary’s eagerness, and stopped her short in the midst of the Elliot countenance."
"说到温特沃思上校，尽管安妮没有冒失地再询问，但他们也主动提供了足够的信息。可以料想，他的情绪最近已经大大恢复了。随着路易莎病情的好转，他的情绪也改善了，同第一周相比，他已经判若两人了。他没有去探望路易莎，并非常害怕见面会给路易莎带来不利的影响，所以没有催促着去见她。相反，他正打算出门一星期或十天，等她头部的伤势更好些再说。他曾经说过要去普利茅斯住上一星期，想要劝说本威克舰长陪他一起去。但是查尔斯一直坚持认为，本威克舰长似乎更想乘马车到凯林奇去一趟。","With regard to Captain Wentworth, though Anne hazarded no enquiries, there was voluntary communication sufficient.His spirits had been greatly recovering lately as might be expected.As Louisa improved, he had improved, and he was now quite a different creature from what he had been the first week.He had not seen Louisa; and was so extremely fearful of any ill consequence to her from an interview, that he did not press for it at all; and, on the contrary, seemed to have a plan of going away for a week or ten days, till her head was stronger.He had talked of going down to Plymouth for a week, and wanted to persuade Captain Benwick to go with him; but, as Charles maintained to the last, Captain Benwick seemed much more disposed to ride over to Kellynch."
"毋庸置疑，自从这次谈话起，拉塞尔夫人和安妮便时不时地想起本威克舰长。拉塞尔夫人一听见门铃声，就以为是他来了。而安妮每次在他父亲的田地里独自尽情地散步或在村里进行慈善访问回来，总想着能不能遇到他或者听到他的消息。可是，本威克舰长并没有来。或许他并不像查尔斯所说的那么想到这里来，或许他太羞涩。空盼了一星期之后，拉塞尔夫人便认定，不值得给这人这么大的关注，他并不像当初那么引人注意。","There can be no doubt that Lady Russell and Anne were both occasionally thinking of Captain Benwick, from this time.Lady Russell could not hear the door-bell without feeling that it might be his herald; nor could Anne return from any stroll of solitary indulgence in her father’s grounds, or any visit of charity in the village, without wondering whether she might see him or hear of him.Captain Benwick came not, however.He was either less disposed for it than Charles had imagined, or he was too shy; and after giving him a week’s indulgence, Lady Russell determined him to be unworthy of the interest which he had been beginning to excite."
"马斯格罗夫夫妇回来了，从学校接回兴高采烈的孩子们，还把哈维尔太太的小孩们也带来了，阿珀克罗斯热闹了，而莱姆则清静了下来。亨里埃塔留在那里照顾路易莎。家中的其他人又都回到了府上。","The Musgroves came back to receive their happy boys and girls from school, bringing with them Mrs. Harville’s little children, to improve the noise of Uppercross, and lessen that of Lyme.Henrietta remained with Louisa; but all the rest of the family were again in their usual quarters."
"拉塞尔夫人和安妮去看望过他们一次，安妮不得不感到阿珀克罗斯又十分热闹了。尽管亨里埃塔、路易莎、查尔斯•海特和温特沃思上校都不在，可是那里的情景同她最后一次见到的情况形成极强烈的对照。","Lady Russell and Anne paid their compliments to them once, when Anne could not but feel that Uppercross was already quite alive again.Though neither Henrietta, nor Louisa, nor Charles Hayter, nor Captain Wentworth were there, the room presented as strong a contrast as could be wished to the last state she had seen it in."
"哈维尔家的孩子们紧紧地围在马斯格罗夫太太的身边，她小心翼翼地保护着他们，不让他们受到从乡舍上赶来逗他们的两个男孩的欺负。房间的一头是一张桌子，围着几个唧唧喳喳的女孩，正在剪绸子和金纸。房间的另一头是支架和托盘，支架被盘子里的腌猪肉和冷馅饼压弯了，一群喧闹的小孩子在那里嬉闹。整个场面少不了劈啪作响的圣诞炉火，尽管周围很嘈杂，但它似乎执意要大家听见它的声音。在马斯格罗夫太太和安妮来访问时，查尔斯和玛丽当然也来了，马斯格罗夫先生特意向拉塞尔夫人表示敬意，在她身边坐了有十分钟，大声同她闲谈。可是坐在他腿上的几个孩子吵个不停，拉塞尔夫人还是听不清他在说什么。这真是一场美好的家庭片。","Immediately surrounding Mrs. Musgrove were the little Harvilles, whom she was sedulously guarding from the tyranny of the two children from the Cottage, expressly arrived to amuse them.On one side was a table occupied by some chattering girls, cutting up silk and gold paper; and on the other were tressels and trays, bending under the weight of brawn and cold pies, where riotous boys were holding high revel; the whole completed by a roaring Christmas fire, which seemed determined to be heard, in spite of all the noise of the others.Charles and Mary also came in, of course, during their visit, and Mr. Musgrove made a point of paying his respects to Lady Russell, and sat down close to her for ten minutes, talking with a very raised voice, but from the clamour of the children on his knees, generally in vain.It was a fine family-piece."
"从安妮的性情来判断，她会觉得路易莎的伤势一度使大家受到很大刺激，现在家里这么喧闹，对恢复平静的心境极为不利。却说马斯格罗夫太太，她把安妮拉到身边，一再地对她对大家的照顾表示热忱的感谢，最后她还简单谈了几句她当时痛苦的心情，然后高兴地环视了一下房间，又说，在经历这一切变故之后，现在家里有了一点平静的欢乐氛围，这对她是最好不过了。","Anne, judging from her own temperament, would have deemed such a domestic hurricane a bad restorative of the nerves, which Louisa’s illness must have so greatly shaken.But Mrs. Musgrove, who got Anne near her on purpose to thank her most cordially, again and again, for all her attentions to them, concluded a short recapitulation of what she had suffered herself by observing, with a happy glance round the room, that after all she had gone through, nothing was so likely to do her good as a little quiet cheerfulness at home."
"路易莎现在恢复得很快。她的母亲甚至觉得她能够参加她的弟妹开学前的家宴。哈维尔夫妇答应，不管路易莎什么时候回来，他们都会陪她来阿珀克罗斯住上一段时间。眼下，温特沃思上校到什罗普郡看望他哥哥去了。","Louisa was now recovering apace.Her mother could even think of her being able to join their party at home, before her brothers and sisters went to school again.The Harvilles had promised to come with her and stay at Uppercross, whenever she returned.Captain Wentworth was gone, for the present, to see his brother in Shropshire."
"“我希望我今后能记住，”她们一坐进马车，拉塞尔夫人就说，“不要在圣诞节期间来访问阿珀克罗斯。”","“I hope I shall remember, in future,” said Lady Russell, as soon as they were reseated in the carriage, “not to call at Uppercross in the Christmas holidays.”"
"对于喧闹声，如同对其他事物一样，各人有各人的看法。各种声音是无害还是令人苦恼，取决于其性质而不是音量大小。此后不久，在一个雨后的下午，拉塞尔夫人来到了巴斯，马车沿着长长的街道从老桥往卡姆登巷驶去，挤在川流不息的各种车辆之间，大小货车发出沉重的隆隆声，卖报的、卖松饼的和卖牛奶的都在高声叫喊，没完没了的木鞋的叮当声，她也没有抱怨。不，这是冬天里给人们带来乐趣的声音；听到这些声音，拉塞尔夫人反倒感到精神振奋。她像马斯格罗夫太太一样，虽然嘴上不说，心里却觉得，在乡下呆了那么久，现在这一片平静的欢乐气氛，对她来说是最好不过了。","Everybody has their taste in noises as well as in other matters; and sounds are quite innoxious, or most distressing, by their sort rather than their quantity.When Lady Russell not long afterwards, was entering Bath on a wet afternoon, and driving through the long course of streets from the Old Bridge to Camden Place, amidst the dash of other carriages, the heavy rumble of carts and drays, the bawling of newspapermen, muffin-men and milkmen, and the ceaseless clink of pattens, she made no complaint.No, these were noises which belonged to the winter pleasures; her spirits rose under their influence; and like Mrs. Musgrove, she was feeling, though not saying, that after being long in the country, nothing could be so good for her as a little quiet cheerfulness."
"安妮没有这样的感觉。她虽然没有作声，但是对巴斯却仍然十分反感。她瞧了一眼在蒙蒙细雨中一片鳞次栉比的建筑物，一点儿也不想细看了。尽管马车在街上行驶令人很不舒服，但是又嫌马车跑得太快了。因为她来了以后谁见到她会高兴呢？她带着眷恋惆怅的心情，回想着阿珀克罗斯的热闹和凯林奇的幽静。","Anne did not share these feelings.She persisted in a very determined, though very silent disinclination for Bath; caught the first dim view of the extensive buildings, smoking in rain, without any wish of seeing them better; felt their progress through the streets to be, however disagreeable, yet too rapid; for who would be glad to see her when she arrived?And looked back, with fond regret, to the bustles of Uppercross and the seclusion of Kellynch."
"伊丽莎白在最近的一封信中提到了一则比较有趣的消息。埃利奥特先生在巴斯。他到卡姆登巷拜访了一次，又去了第二次、第三次，显得十分殷勤。如果伊丽莎白和她父亲没有自欺欺人的话，埃利奥特先生就像过去拼命怠慢他们一样，现在又在拼命巴结他们，而且他还明确表示这种交往的重要价值。如果情况果真如此，那倒不错。拉塞尔夫人对埃利奥特先生既有一种友好的好奇又有一种困惑不解，她已经放弃了不久前对玛丽说过的“她不想见这个人”的看法。她很想见见他。如果埃利奥特先生真想寻求和解，成为家族中尽职的一支，那大家就应该原谅他以前从家族中分裂出去的行为。","Elizabeth’s last letter had communicated a piece of news of some interest.Mr. Elliot was in Bath.He had called in Camden Place; had called a second time, a third; had been pointedly attentive.If Elizabeth and her father did not deceive themselves, had been taking much pains to seek the acquaintance, and proclaim the value of the connection, as he had formerly taken pains to shew neglect.This was very wonderful if it were true; and Lady Russell was in a state of very agreeable curiosity and perplexity about Mr. Elliot, already recanting the sentiment she had so lately expressed to Mary, of his being “a man whom she had no wish to see.”She had a great wish to see him.If he really sought to reconcile himself like a dutiful branch, he must be forgiven for having dismembered himself from the paternal tree."
"安妮对这个情况并不这么乐观，不过她觉得她不妨再见见埃利奥特先生，而对住在巴斯的很多人，她却连见都不想见。","Anne was not animated to an equal pitch by the circumstance, but she felt that she would rather see Mr. Elliot again than not, which was more than she could say for many other persons in Bath."
"她在卡姆登巷下车；拉塞尔夫人则继续朝自己在里弗斯街的住所驶去。","She was put down in Camden Place; and Lady Russell then drove to her own lodgings, in Rivers Street."
"第十五章","CHAPTER 15"
"沃尔特爵士在卡姆登巷租了一幢很好的房子，既高大又庄严，正符合一位重要人物的身份。他和伊丽莎白在那里住了下来，他们也感到很满意。","Sir Walter had taken a very good house in Camden Place, a lofty dignified situation, such as becomes a man of consequence; and both he and Elizabeth were settled there, much to their satisfaction."
"安妮怀着沉重的心情走进屋去，一想到自己要在这里囚禁上几个月，便忧心忡忡地暗自思忖：“哦！什么时候我才能再离开这里啊？”然而，由于家人对她的接待中有几分意外的亲切，她的情绪有所好转。她的父亲和姐姐为了向她炫耀房子和家具，见到她很高兴，对她也很和气。他们坐下来吃饭时，发现现在是四个人了，觉得很满意。","Anne entered it with a sinking heart, anticipating an imprisonment of many months, and anxiously saying to herself, “Oh! when shall I leave you again?” A degree of unexpected cordiality, however, in the welcome she received, did her good.Her father and sister were glad to see her, for the sake of shewing her the house and furniture, and met her with kindness.Her making a fourth, when they sat down to dinner, was noticed as an advantage."
"克莱太太非常和颜悦色、笑容满面，不过她的礼貌和微笑是理所当然的。安妮总是觉得，她一到来，克莱太太就会装出一副得体的神态，不过其他人的恳切之情她却是万万没有预料到。他们显然情绪极佳，安妮马上就要听到其中的缘由了。他们不想听她说什么。他们只准备听听老邻居们怀念他们的恭维话，可是安妮却无可奉告，他们就随便问了几句，接下去便垄断了全部话题。阿珀克罗斯根本激不起他们的兴趣，凯林奇府也没有什么可谈，要谈的只有巴斯。","Mrs. Clay was very pleasant, and very smiling, but her courtesies and smiles were more a matter of course.Anne had always felt that she would pretend what was proper on her arrival, but the complaisance of the others was unlooked for.They were evidently in excellent spirits, and she was soon to listen to the causes.They had no inclination to listen to her.After laying out for some compliments of being deeply regretted in their old neighbourhood, which Anne could not pay, they had only a few faint enquiries to make, before the talk must be all their own.Uppercross excited no interest, Kellynch very little: it was all Bath."
"他们高高兴兴地向安妮担保，巴斯处处比他们预料的要好。他们的房子无疑是卡姆登巷最漂亮的一幢。他们的客厅甚至比他们耳闻目睹过的其他客厅有更多明显的优点，而陈设和家具的选择也无不如此。人们都争先恐后地来同他们结识。人人都想来拜访他们。他们已经谢绝了很多引荐，但是仍然不断地有素不相识的人留下他们的名片。","They had the pleasure of assuring her that Bath more than answered their expectations in every respect.Their house was undoubtedly the best in Camden Place; their drawing-rooms had many decided advantages over all the others which they had either seen or heard of, and the superiority was not less in the style of the fitting-up, or the taste of the furniture.Their acquaintance was exceedingly sought after.Everybody was wanting to visit them.They had drawn back from many introductions, and still were perpetually having cards left by people of whom they knew nothing."
"这真是无比的欣慰啊！安妮能对父亲和姐姐的幸福感表示惊讶吗？她也许不会惊讶，但是她肯定会叹息，父亲居然对他自己的变化不感到屈辱，对丧失地产所有者的责任和尊严并不感到任何遗憾，竟然在一个小城镇里发现这么多值得骄傲的东西！当伊丽莎白推开折门，得意地从一间客厅走到另一间，夸耀这些房间如何宽敞时，这时安妮不得不叹息，感到可笑和惊讶。伊丽莎白原是凯林奇府的女主人，居然会对两堵墙之间仅有三十英尺宽的房子感到自豪。","Here were funds of enjoyment.Could Anne wonder that her father and sister were happy?She might not wonder, but she must sigh that her father should feel no degradation in his change, should see nothing to regret in the duties and dignity of the resident landholder, should find so much to be vain of in the littlenesses of a town; and she must sigh, and smile, and wonder too, as Elizabeth threw open the folding-doors and walked with exultation from one drawing-room to the other, boasting of their space; at the possibility of that woman, who had been mistress of Kellynch Hall, finding extent to be proud of between two walls, perhaps thirty feet asunder."
"但是，这不是让他们高兴的全部原因。其中还有埃利奥特先生。安妮听到他们大谈特谈埃利奥特先生。他不仅得到了他们的宽恕，而且还博得了他们的好感。他在巴斯住了两个星期左右。（11月份他去伦敦时曾路过巴斯，自然也听说了沃尔特爵士已在那里定居的消息，他虽然在那里逗留了24个小时，却未能利用这个机会去拜访。）不过他现在已经在巴斯呆了两个星期，他到达后的第一件事情就是到卡姆登留一下名片，接着便千方百计地寻见。他们见面时，他态度坦诚，爽快地为过去的事情表示歉意，恳请他们再次把他看作是一位亲戚。因此他们之间已经完全恢复了过去的友好关系。","But this was not all which they had to make them happy.They had Mr. Elliot too.Anne had a great deal to hear of Mr. Elliot.He was not only pardoned, they were delighted with him.He had been in Bath about a fortnight; (he had passed through Bath in November, in his way to London, when the intelligence of Sir Walter’s being settled there had of course reached him, though only twenty-four hours in the place, but he had not been able to avail himself of it;) but he had now been a fortnight in Bath, and his first object on arriving, had been to leave his card in Camden Place, following it up by such assiduous endeavours to meet, and when they did meet, by such great openness of conduct, such readiness to apologize for the past, such solicitude to be received as a relation again, that their former good understanding was completely re-established."
"他们觉得他没有什么过错。他为自己过去的怠慢表现解释了一番，从而消除了大家的恶感。他说这完全是由误解造成的。他从未想过要脱离家族，倒是担心自己被抛弃了，但是又不知道原因，出于谨慎，他只有缄口不语。他们暗示他曾发表过不尊重或不喜欢这一家族和家族荣誉的言论，他听了感到十分愤慨。他一直炫耀自己是埃利奥特家族的一员，他有着极其传统的家族观念，这与当前流行的无视旧礼教的风气不太相称。他确实很震惊，不过他的性格和全部行为必然会驳倒这一误解。他可以请沃尔特爵士去询问所有认识他的人，而且他在这方面也在做出努力，一有机会就寻求和解，希望恢复亲戚和假定继承人的关系，这也有力地证明了他对此事的态度。","They had not a fault to find in him.He had explained away all the appearance of neglect on his own side.It had originated in misapprehension entirely.He had never had an idea of throwing himself off; he had feared that he was thrown off, but knew not why, and delicacy had kept him silent.Upon the hint of having spoken disrespectfully or carelessly of the family and the family honours, he was quite indignant.He, who had ever boasted of being an Elliot, and whose feelings, as to connection, were only too strict to suit the unfeudal tone of the present day.He was astonished, indeed, but his character and general conduct must refute it.He could refer Sir Walter to all who knew him; and certainly, the pains he had been taking on this, the first opportunity of reconciliation, to be restored to the footing of a relation and heir-presumptive, was a strong proof of his opinions on the subject."
"他们发现，埃利奥特先生的婚事也情有可原。这可不是他自己说的，是他的一个非常亲密的朋友沃利斯上校透露的。这是个非常体面的人，是个十足的绅士（沃尔特爵士还补充说，长得也不错），住在莫尔伯勒，过着阔绰的生活，经他自己刻意要求，埃利奥特先生从中介绍，结识了沃尔特爵士，他提到了与这桩婚姻有关的一两件事情，因而大大减轻了此事的耻辱。","The circumstances of his marriage, too, were found to admit of much extenuation.This was an article not to be entered on by himself; but a very intimate friend of his, a Colonel Wallis, a highly respectable man, perfectly the gentleman, (and not an ill-looking man, Sir Walter added), who was living in very good style in Marlborough Buildings, and had, at his own particular request, been admitted to their acquaintance through Mr. Elliot, had mentioned one or two things relative to the marriage, which made a material difference in the discredit of it."
"沃利斯上校很早就认识埃利奥特先生，与他的妻子也很熟悉，对整个事情非常了解。她当然不是出身名门，但却受过良好的教育，多才多艺，非常富有，而且对他的朋友极为钟情。这一点颇有魅力。她主动追求埃利奥特。要不是这样的吸引力，她再有钱也不能迷住埃利奥特先生，再说，她还向沃尔特爵士担保说，她是一位非常漂亮的女人。这些就使那桩婚事大为改观。一位非常漂亮、非常有钱的女人钟情于他！沃尔特爵士似乎承认，这么说来这件事可以完全谅解。伊丽莎白虽然对此事并不完全赞同，却觉得情有可原。","Colonel Wallis had known Mr. Elliot long, had been well acquainted also with his wife, had perfectly understood the whole story.She was certainly not a woman of family, but well educated, accomplished, rich, and excessively in love with his friend.There had been the charm.She had sought him.Without that attraction, not all her money would have tempted Elliot, and Sir Walter was, moreover, assured of her having been a very fine woman.Here was a great deal to soften the business.A very fine woman with a large fortune, in love with him!Sir Walter seemed to admit it as complete apology; and though Elizabeth could not see the circumstance in quite so favourable a light, she allowed it be a great extenuation."
"埃利奥特先生三番五次地来拜访，同他们吃过一次晚餐，他显然为自己受到盛情邀请而高兴，因为他们一般不邀请别人吃饭。总之，他为自己受到伯父、堂妹的种种款待而高兴，并把自己的全部幸福寄托在同卡姆登巷的亲密关系上。","Mr. Elliot had called repeatedly, had dined with them once, evidently delighted by the distinction of being asked, for they gave no dinners in general; delighted, in short, by every proof of cousinly notice, and placing his whole happiness in being on intimate terms in Camden Place."
"安妮听着这些话，但却不太明白。她知道，听他们的话应该打个折扣，而且要打很大的折扣。她听到的全部内容都经过了修饰润色。这一和解过程中，一切听起来夸大或者不合情理的地方，很可能毫无根据，仅仅是叙述者说说罢了。然而，她也觉得经过多年的间隔，埃利奥特先生又想博得他们的好感，似乎不那么简单。从世俗的眼光看来，埃利奥特先生同沃尔特爵士搞好关系既无利可图，而相互不合，他也不会失去任何东西。十有八九，他已经比沃尔特爵士富有了，而凯林奇庄园和爵位以后肯定会归他所有。一个聪明人，他看上去像一个很聪明的人，他为什么要这么做呢？她只能找到一个解释，也许是为了伊丽莎白。过去也许真的有好感，但是机会和意外的遭遇已把他推上了另外一条道路。现在既然他可以按自己的意愿行事了，就可能向伊丽莎白献殷勤。伊丽莎白当然很漂亮，很有教养，举止优雅，埃利奥特先生以前只在公开场合遇见她，当时他还很年轻，也许她的性格从没有被他看透过。埃利奥特先生现在生活阅历多了，眼光也敏锐了，伊丽莎白的脾气和见解是否还经得起他的审查可是另外一回事，而且也令人担心。安妮恳切地希望，埃利奥特先生要是为了伊丽莎白而来，那他最好不要过于挑剔，不要太善于观察。当他们谈到埃利奥特先生经常来访时，伊丽莎白和她的朋友克莱太太之间交换了一两次眼色，这表明伊丽莎白相信埃利奥特爵士看上了她，同时也表明她的朋友克莱太太支持这种想法。","Anne listened, but without quite understanding it.Allowances, large allowances, she knew, must be made for the ideas of those who spoke.She heard it all under embellishment.All that sounded extravagant or irrational in the progress of the reconciliation might have no origin but in the language of the relators.Still, however, she had the sensation of there being something more than immediately appeared, in Mr. Elliot’s wishing, after an interval of so many years, to be well received by them.In a worldly view, he had nothing to gain by being on terms with Sir Walter; nothing to risk by a state of variance.In all probability he was already the richer of the two, and the Kellynch estate would as surely be his hereafter as the title.A sensible man, and he had looked like a very sensible man, why should it be an object to him?She could only offer one solution; it was, perhaps, for Elizabeth’s sake.There might really have been a liking formerly, though convenience and accident had drawn him a different way; and now that he could afford to please himself, he might mean to pay his addresses to her.Elizabeth was certainly very handsome, with well-bred, elegant manners, and her character might never have been penetrated by Mr. Elliot, knowing her but in public, and when very young himself.How her temper and understanding might bear the investigation of his present keener time of life was another concern and rather a fearful one.Most earnestly did she wish that he might not be too nice, or too observant if Elizabeth were his object; and that Elizabeth was disposed to believe herself so, and that her friend Mrs. Clay was encouraging the idea, seemed apparent by a glance or two between them, while Mr. Elliot’s frequent visits were talked of."
"安妮说起她在莱姆见过埃利奥特先生两眼，可是没人注意听。“啊！是的，那也许是埃利奥特先生。他们不知道。也许可能是他。”他们不愿意听安妮谈论埃利奥特先生。他们自己正在谈论他，尤其是沃尔特爵士。他公正地谈到埃利奥特先生很有绅士派头，风度优雅，衣着时髦，相貌端庄，眼神敏锐。但与此同时，“又必须遗憾地指出，他的下颌本来就过于突出，时间的流逝似乎更加深了这一缺陷，再说，他也不能违心地说，过了十年他还容颜依旧。埃利奥特先生却认为他（沃尔特爵士）看起来同上次他们分开时一模一样。”但使他尴尬的是，沃尔特爵士“不能用同样的赞美来回敬他。不过他并不想抱怨什么。沃尔特爵士的确比大多数人要潇洒。无论人们在哪里看到他跟沃尔特爵士在一块，他都不会介意的。”","Anne mentioned the glimpses she had had of him at Lyme, but without being much attended to.“Oh! yes, perhaps, it had been Mr. Elliot.They did not know.It might be him, perhaps.”They could not listen to her description of him.They were describing him themselves; Sir Walter especially.He did justice to his very gentlemanlike appearance, his air of elegance and fashion, his good shaped face, his sensible eye; but, at the same time, “must lament his being very much under-hung, a defect which time seemed to have increased; nor could he pretend to say that ten years had not altered almost every feature for the worse.Mr. Elliot appeared to think that he (Sir Walter) was looking exactly as he had done when they last parted;” but Sir Walter had “not been able to return the compliment entirely, which had embarrassed him.He did not mean to complain, however.Mr. Elliot was better to look at than most men, and he had no objection to being seen with him anywhere.”"
"整个晚上他们都在谈论埃利奥特先生和他在莫尔伯勒的朋友们。“沃利斯上校是如此急切地想结识他们！埃利奥特先生也急于让他这么做！”还有一位沃利斯太太，到目前为止他们只是听说她的情况，因为她最近就要分娩了。但是埃利奥特先生说她是“一位非常迷人，很值得介绍给卡姆登巷认识的女人，”等她一恢复，他们就会同她结识。沃尔特爵士很看好沃利斯太太，说她是一位非常美丽的女人，很漂亮。“他渴望见到她。他希望这位太太能弥补街上那些屡见不鲜的姿色平庸的女人对他所造成的遗憾。巴斯感到最糟糕的是，姿色平庸的女人太多。他并不是想说这里没有漂亮的女人，但是姿色平庸的女人比例太大。他散步时经常注意到，一张漂亮的脸蛋后面往往跟着30到35个丑八怪。一次，他在邦德街的一家商店里一个接一个地数着走过的87个女人，其中没有一个长相是过得去的。那是一个霜冻的早晨，确实是寒气逼人，一千个女人中也不见得有一个能受得了这种严寒的考验。但是巴斯的丑女仍然是多得可怕。说到男人就更糟了，要糟不知多少呢！满街都是骨瘦如柴的人！很显然，这里的女人很难见到一个像样的男人，这可以从相貌端正的男人引起的反应中看得明明白白。不论他同沃利斯上校（他是一个英俊的军人，只是黄头发略微泛红而已）臂挽臂走到哪里，总会发现所有女人的目光都在盯着他。的的确确所有女人的眼睛都在盯着沃利斯上校。”沃尔特爵士多么谦虚！可是别人也不会放过他。他的女儿和克莱太太会一同暗示说，沃利斯上校的同伴同样有漂亮的身材，而且绝对没有黄里透红的头发。","Mr. Elliot, and his friends in Marlborough Buildings, were talked of the whole evening.“Colonel Wallis had been so impatient to be introduced to them!and Mr. Elliot so anxious that he should!” and there was a Mrs. Wallis, at present known only to them by description, as she was in daily expectation of her confinement; but Mr. Elliot spoke of her as “a most charming woman, quite worthy of being known in Camden Place,” and as soon as she recovered they were to be acquainted.Sir Walter thought much of Mrs. Wallis; she was said to be an excessively pretty woman, beautiful.“He longed to see her.He hoped she might make some amends for the many very plain faces he was continually passing in the streets.The worst of Bath was the number of its plain women.He did not mean to say that there were no pretty women, but the number of the plain was out of all proportion.He had frequently observed, as he walked, that one handsome face would be followed by thirty, or five-and-thirty frights; and once, as he had stood in a shop on Bond Street, he had counted eighty-seven women go by, one after another, without there being a tolerable face among them.It had been a frosty morning, to be sure, a sharp frost, which hardly one woman in a thousand could stand the test of.But still, there certainly were a dreadful multitude of ugly women in Bath; and as for the men!they were infinitely worse.Such scarecrows as the streets were full of!It was evident how little the women were used to the sight of anything tolerable, by the effect which a man of decent appearance produced.He had never walked anywhere arm-in-arm with Colonel Wallis (who was a fine military figure, though sandy-haired) without observing that every woman’s eye was upon him; every woman’s eye was sure to be upon Colonel Wallis.”Modest Sir Walter!He was not allowed to escape, however.His daughter and Mrs. Clay united in hinting that Colonel Wallis’s companion might have as good a figure as Colonel Wallis, and certainly was not sandy-haired."
"“玛丽看上去怎么样啊？”沃尔特爵士高兴地问道。“上次我见到她时，她的鼻子通红，不过我想不至于天天如此吧。”","“How is Mary looking?” said Sir Walter, in the height of his good humour.“The last time I saw her she had a red nose, but I hope that may not happen every day.”"
"“哦！不，那是非常偶然的。总的来说，她身体很好，而且自从米迦勒节以来，她的气色一直不错。”","“Oh! no, that must have been quite accidental.In general she has been in very good health and very good looks since Michaelmas.”"
"“要不是我担心她会冒着刺骨的寒风外出，弄得皮肤粗糙不堪，我真想送一顶新帽子和一件皮上衣给她。”","“If I thought it would not tempt her to go out in sharp winds, and grow coarse, I would send her a new hat and pelisse.”"
"安妮正在想她是不是应该贸然建议，一件礼服或一顶帽子不至于被如此滥用吧，但一阵敲门声把一切都打断了。“有人敲门！这么晚了！这都十点了。会不会是埃利奥特先生？他们知道他去兰斯当克雷森特吃晚饭了。也许他会在回家路上顺便进来看望他们一下。他们想不到还会有别的人。克莱太太认定是埃利奥特先生在敲门。”克莱太太猜对了。在男管家兼男仆周到的陪同下，埃利奥特先生给引进了房间。","Anne was considering whether she should venture to suggest that a gown, or a cap, would not be liable to any such misuse, when a knock at the door suspended everything.“A knock at the door!and so late!It was ten o’clock.Could it be Mr. Elliot?They knew he was to dine in Lansdown Crescent.It was possible that he might stop in his way home to ask them how they did.They could think of no one else.Mrs. Clay decidedly thought it Mr. Elliot’s knock.”Mrs. Clay was right.With all the state which a butler and foot-boy could give, Mr. Elliot was ushered into the room."
"就是那个人，一点不错，只不过是换了套衣服而已。安妮往后退了退，他在向别人表示问候，请她姐姐原谅在这么不适当的时候来访，但是“他既然在附近，就没法让自己不来了解一下她和她的朋友昨天晚上是否着凉了”等等，等等。他说话彬彬有礼，别人也都尽量有礼貌地听着，不过该介绍一下安妮了。沃尔特爵士谈起了自己的小女儿。“埃利奥特先生，请允许我将小女儿介绍给你”（这种时候他哪里想得起玛丽）。安妮羞红的脸上微微一笑，恰到好处地展示了埃利奥特先生根本不曾忘却的漂亮面孔，安妮当即发现他微微一怔，不禁觉得有些好笑，他居然一直不知道她是谁。他看上去大为惊讶，但是更多的还是高兴；他的眼睛在熠熠发光！他非常高兴能认识这样一位亲戚，还提起了过去的事情，诚恳地请求安妮把他当成老朋友。他还是像在莱姆一样相貌堂堂，说话时脸上更是容光焕发，一举一动都得体之至，潇洒至极，十分大方和气，安妮觉得他优美的风度只能同一个人相媲美。虽然他们的形象不同，但是他们可以说是同样优美。","It was the same, the very same man, with no difference but of dress.Anne drew a little back, while the others received his compliments, and her sister his apologies for calling at so unusual an hour, but “he could not be so near without wishing to know that neither she nor her friend had taken cold the day before,” &c. &c; which was all as politely done, and as politely taken, as possible, but her part must follow then.Sir Walter talked of his youngest daughter; “Mr. Elliot must give him leave to present him to his youngest daughter” (there was no occasion for remembering Mary); and Anne, smiling and blushing, very becomingly shewed to Mr. Elliot the pretty features which he had by no means forgotten, and instantly saw, with amusement at his little start of surprise, that he had not been at all aware of who she was.He looked completely astonished, but not more astonished than pleased; his eyes brightened!and with the most perfect alacrity he welcomed the relationship, alluded to the past, and entreated to be received as an acquaintance already.He was quite as good-looking as he had appeared at Lyme, his countenance improved by speaking, and his manners were so exactly what they ought to be, so polished, so easy, so particularly agreeable, that she could compare them in excellence to only one person’s manners.They were not the same, but they were, perhaps, equally good."
"他同他们一起坐了下来，为他们的谈话增添了不少趣味。毫无疑问，他是个聪明人。十分钟就足以证明这一点。他的语气、神态、话题的选择、懂得适可而止；这一切都表明他既聪明又有洞察力。一有机会，他便同安妮谈起了莱姆，想比较一下双方对这个地方的看法，但是他特别想谈的是他们同时投宿于同一家旅馆的巧事；他谈了一些自己的行踪，了解了一下安妮的情况，并为失去了一个向安妮表示敬意的机会而感到遗憾。安妮简单地谈起了她的同伴和她们在莱姆的活动。埃利奥特先生越听越感到遗憾。他就在他们隔壁的房间里孤独地呆了整整一个晚上，听到了他们不断的欢笑声，心想他们一定是极快乐的一群，很想同他们在一起，但他当然丝毫没有想到他会有任何权利来自我介绍。他要是问一下这群人是谁就好了！马斯格罗夫这一姓氏足以向他说明一切。“好了，这将使我改掉从不在旅馆打听事的荒谬习惯，我年纪很小时就遵循好奇是缺乏教养的表现这一原则。”","He sat down with them, and improved their conversation very much.There could be no doubt of his being a sensible man.Ten minutes were enough to certify that.His tone, his expressions, his choice of subject, his knowing where to stop; it was all the operation of a sensible, discerning mind.As soon as he could, he began to talk to her of Lyme, wanting to compare opinions respecting the place, but especially wanting to speak of the circumstance of their happening to be guests in the same inn at the same time; to give his own route, understand something of hers, and regret that he should have lost such an opportunity of paying his respects to her.She gave him a short account of her party and business at Lyme.His regret increased as he listened.He had spent his whole solitary evening in the room adjoining theirs; had heard voices, mirth continually; thought they must be a most delightful set of people, longed to be with them, but certainly without the smallest suspicion of his possessing the shadow of a right to introduce himself.If he had but asked who the party were!The name of Musgrove would have told him enough.“Well, it would serve to cure him of an absurd practice of never asking a question at an inn, which he had adopted, when quite a young man, on the principal of its being very ungenteel to be curious.”"
"“我想，一个二十一二岁的年轻人，”他说，“对需要具有怎样的风度才能赶上时髦的看法，要比世上其他任何年龄的人都更荒谬。他们常用的方法很愚蠢，而能与这种愚蠢的方法相比拟的是他们愚蠢的想法。”","“The notions of a young man of one or two and twenty,” said he, “as to what is necessary in manners to make him quite the thing, are more absurd, I believe, than those of any other set of beings in the world.The folly of the means they often employ is only to be equalled by the folly of what they have in view.”"
"但是他知道他不能只跟安妮一个人聊天；他很快便同其他人聊了起来，只是偶尔提一提莱姆。","But he must not be addressing his reflections to Anne alone: he knew it; he was soon diffused again among the others, and it was only at intervals that he could return to Lyme."
"不过，他的询问终于促使安妮谈到他离开不久她在莱姆经历的事情。一提起“一次事故”，他就必须得听听原委。当他询问的时候，沃尔特爵士和伊丽莎白也开始询问，但是你又不能不感觉到他们询问的方式是不同的。安妮只能把埃利奥特先生同拉塞尔夫人相比，他们都确实想了解到底出了什么事，关心安妮目睹这一事件时受的痛苦。","His enquiries, however, produced at length an account of the scene she had been engaged in there, soon after his leaving the place.Having alluded to “an accident,” he must hear the whole.When he questioned, Sir Walter and Elizabeth began to question also, but the difference in their manner of doing it could not be unfelt.She could only compare Mr. Elliot to Lady Russell, in the wish of really comprehending what had passed, and in the degree of concern for what she must have suffered in witnessing it."
"他同他们呆了一个小时。壁炉架上那只精致的小钟“银铃般地敲了十一下，”同时远处也开始传来更夫的同样时辰的报告，这时埃利奥特本人或其他人似乎才感到他已经在这里呆了很长时间。","He staid an hour with them.The elegant little clock on the mantel- piece had struck “eleven with its silver sounds,” and the watchman was beginning to be heard at a distance telling the same tale, before Mr. Elliot or any of them seemed to feel that he had been there long."
"安妮事先根本没有想到她在卡姆登巷的第一个晚上会过得这么愉快！","Anne could not have supposed it possible that her first evening in Camden Place could have passed so well!"
"第十六章","CHAPTER 16"
"如果安妮回到家后能确信她父亲没有爱上克莱太太，这会比她知道埃利奥特先生爱上了伊丽莎白更加欣慰。可是她在家才几个小时，就对这一点感到很不安。第二天早晨她下楼吃早饭时，就发现克莱太太正客气地假装要离开他们。安妮猜得出，克莱太太肯定是这样说，“现在安妮小姐回来了，我觉得这里就不再需要我了。”因为伊丽莎白正低声说，“这可算不上理由，真的。我向你保证这不是理由。同你想比，安妮对我来说算不了什么。”她父亲说的话，安妮全听到了，“亲爱的太太，千万别走。你在巴斯还没有怎么看看呢。你来这里只顾着帮忙了。你不能现在离开我们。你必须留下来见见沃利斯太太，那位漂亮的沃利斯太太。我知道，对于你这么一个情趣高雅的人，欣赏美貌对你来说是一种真正的满足。”","There was one point which Anne, on returning to her family, would have been more thankful to ascertain even than Mr. Elliot’s being in love with Elizabeth, which was, her father’s not being in love with Mrs. Clay; and she was very far from easy about it, when she had been at home a few hours.On going down to breakfast the next morning, she found there had just been a decent pretence on the lady’s side of meaning to leave them.She could imagine Mrs. Clay to have said, that “now Miss Anne was come, she could not suppose herself at all wanted;” for Elizabeth was replying in a sort of whisper, “That must not be any reason, indeed.I assure you I feel it none.She is nothing to me, compared with you;” and she was in full time to hear her father say, “My dear madam, this must not be.As yet, you have seen nothing of Bath.You have been here only to be useful.You must not run away from us now.You must stay to be acquainted with Mrs. Wallis, the beautiful Mrs. Wallis.To your fine mind, I well know the sight of beauty is a real gratification.”"
"他说得十分恳切，样子也很诚恳，在看到克莱太太偷偷地向她和伊丽莎白瞥了一眼时，安妮也就不以为奇了。安妮的神色可能显出一点警惕，但是情趣高雅这一赞美似乎却没有引起她姐姐的任何联想。在父女俩如此一致的请求下，克莱太太只好作出让步，答应留下来。","He spoke and looked so much in earnest, that Anne was not surprised to see Mrs. Clay stealing a glance at Elizabeth and herself.Her countenance, perhaps, might express some watchfulness; but the praise of the fine mind did not appear to excite a thought in her sister.The lady could not but yield to such joint entreaties, and promise to stay."
"就在同一个上午，安妮偶然同父亲单独呆了一会儿，父亲赞扬她脸色好多了。表扬她“身体和脸颊不再那么消瘦；她的皮肤和脸色大为改观，更加白净、更加鲜嫩了。她是不是在用什么特殊的化妆品？”“没有，什么也没有用。”“只有高兰，”他猜道，“不，什么也没用。”“哈！这就叫我感到奇怪了，”他接着又说，“你能这样保持下去是再好不过了；最好能保持这样的身体状况；不然我就建议你用高兰，在春天最好经常使用高兰。克莱太太在我的建议下一直在用，你可以看到这对她很有好处。你瞧她的雀斑褪掉了好多。”","In the course of the same morning, Anne and her father chancing to be alone together, he began to compliment her on her improved looks; he thought her “less thin in her person, in her cheeks; her skin, her complexion, greatly improved; clearer, fresher.Had she been using any thing in particular?”“No, nothing.”“Merely Gowland,” he supposed.“No, nothing at all.” “Ha!he was surprised at that;” and added, “certainly you cannot do better than to continue as you are; you cannot be better than well; or I should recommend Gowland, the constant use of Gowland, during the spring months.Mrs. Clay has been using it at my recommendation, and you see what it has done for her.You see how it has carried away her freckles.”"
"要是伊丽莎白能听到这些话就好了！父亲对克莱太太的这种个人赞扬可能会使她警觉起来，尤其是在安妮看来，克莱太太脸上的雀斑根本没有减少。但是一切事情都要碰运气。如果伊丽莎白也要结婚的话，父亲同克莱太太结婚的坏处就会减少很多。至于她自己，她可以永远同拉塞尔夫人住在一起。","If Elizabeth could but have heard this!Such personal praise might have struck her, especially as it did not appear to Anne that the freckles were at all lessened.But everything must take its chance.The evil of a marriage would be much diminished, if Elizabeth were also to marry.As for herself, she might always command a home with Lady Russell."
"在同卡姆登巷的交往中，拉塞尔夫人冷静的头脑和彬彬有礼的举止在这个问题上受到了某种考验。她看到克莱太太如此受宠、安妮却遭到如此冷落时，总是很生气。她虽然同所有在巴斯的人一样喝矿泉水、订购新书刊、结识很多人，但一有空，她总是为此事感到烦恼。","Lady Russell’s composed mind and polite manners were put to some trial on this point, in her intercourse in Camden Place.The sight of Mrs. Clay in such favour, and of Anne so overlooked, was a perpetual provocation to her there; and vexed her as much when she was away, as a person in Bath who drinks the water, gets all the new publications, and has a very large acquaintance, has time to be vexed."
"拉塞尔夫人结识了埃利奥特之后，她对别人变得更加宽厚了，更加冷淡了。他的举止一下子给她留下了好印象。同他谈话时，她发现他表里完全一致，于是她告诉安妮，起初她差一点惊叫起来：“这会是埃利奥特先生吗？”她简直无法想象会有比他更和气、更值得尊敬的人。他身上综合了一切优点：善解人意、见解精辟、通达世故、为人热心。他有强烈的家族感情和家族荣誉感，既不傲慢也不怯懦；他过着一种富有而慷慨的生活，却不炫耀；他对一切重大问题都有自己的见解，但在世俗礼节方面从不违背公众的舆论。他稳重、机警、温和、坦率；从不因为情绪不好和自私而发脾气，尽管有人认为这是感情强烈的体现。然而他对可亲可爱的事情很敏感，很珍视幸福的家庭生活，自认为热情奔放的人和性格激烈冲动的人很少有这种品质。她确信他的婚姻并不美满。沃利斯上校这么说的，拉塞尔夫人也这么看。但是这种不幸并没有使他变得忧郁，也不影响他考虑第二种选择（这一点拉塞尔夫人很快就猜中了）。她对埃利奥特先生的满意驱散了克莱太太给她带来的所有烦恼。","As Mr. Elliot became known to her, she grew more charitable, or more indifferent, towards the others.His manners were an immediate recommendation; and on conversing with him she found the solid so fully supporting the superficial, that she was at first, as she told Anne, almost ready to exclaim, “Can this be Mr. Elliot?” and could not seriously picture to herself a more agreeable or estimable man.Everything united in him; good understanding, correct opinions, knowledge of the world, and a warm heart.He had strong feelings of family attachment and family honour, without pride or weakness; he lived with the liberality of a man of fortune, without display; he judged for himself in everything essential, without defying public opinion in any point of worldly decorum.He was steady, observant, moderate, candid; never run away with by spirits or by selfishness, which fancied itself strong feeling; and yet, with a sensibility to what was amiable and lovely, and a value for all the felicities of domestic life, which characters of fancied enthusiasm and violent agitation seldom really possess.She was sure that he had not been happy in marriage.Colonel Wallis said it, and Lady Russell saw it; but it had been no unhappiness to sour his mind, nor (she began pretty soon to suspect) to prevent his thinking of a second choice.Her satisfaction in Mr. Elliot outweighed all the plague of Mrs. Clay."
"安妮几年前便意识到，她跟她的好朋友也会想法不一样。因此，看到拉塞尔夫人对埃利奥特先生极力寻求和解一事既不感到怀疑又不感到前后矛盾，看到她不去探究表面现象背后还有什么动机，安妮并不感到奇怪。在拉塞尔夫人看来，埃利奥特先生成熟后自然会感到，在所有明智的任务当中，最值得向往、最可取的做法是同一族之长保持良好的关系。这是时间对一个头脑本来清醒的年轻人最简单的影响过程，这种人只有在年轻时才会犯错误。然而安妮还是冒昧地笑了笑，最后提起了“伊丽莎白”。拉塞尔夫人一边听，一边望了她一眼，只是谨慎地回答说：“——伊丽莎白！很好。时间会解释一切的。”","It was now some years since Anne had begun to learn that she and her excellent friend could sometimes think differently; and it did not surprise her, therefore, that Lady Russell should see nothing suspicious or inconsistent, nothing to require more motives than appeared, in Mr. Elliot’s great desire of a reconciliation.In Lady Russell’s view, it was perfectly natural that Mr. Elliot, at a mature time of life, should feel it a most desirable object, and what would very generally recommend him among all sensible people, to be on good terms with the head of his family; the simplest process in the world of time upon a head naturally clear, and only erring in the heyday of youth.Anne presumed, however, still to smile about it, and at last to mention “Elizabeth.”Lady Russell listened, and looked, and made only this cautious reply:“—Elizabeth! very well; time will explain.”"
"安妮经过一番观察，觉得也只有等到将来，问题才能见分晓。现在她不能得出任何结论。在这家里，伊丽莎白是头号人物；她已经习惯于被人们称为“埃利奥特小姐”，任何过分的亲昵似乎都不可能。还要记住埃利奥特先生丧妻还不到七个月。在这一点上他推迟一点时间还情有可原。事实上，安妮每次看到埃利奥特先生帽子边上的黑纱就担心她对埃利奥特先生的这种想法是不可原谅的。因为虽说他的婚姻并不美满，到底还是维持了那么多年，她无法理解他会很快从婚姻结束这一可怕的经历中恢复过来。","It was a reference to the future, which Anne, after a little observation, felt she must submit to.She could determine nothing at present.In that house Elizabeth must be first; and she was in the habit of such general observance as “Miss Elliot,” that any particularity of attention seemed almost impossible.Mr. Elliot, too, it must be remembered, had not been a widower seven months.A little delay on his side might be very excusable.In fact, Anne could never see the crape round his hat, without fearing that she was the inexcusable one, in attributing to him such imaginations; for though his marriage had not been very happy, still it had existed so many years that she could not comprehend a very rapid recovery from the awful impression of its being dissolved."
"不管结果如何，埃利奥特先生无疑是他们在巴斯遇到的最令人愉快的人：安妮没有见到任何可以与他相比的人；不时地同他谈谈莱姆是一种莫大的享受，他似乎也同安妮一样希望再到莱姆看看，更多地了解莱姆。他们多次谈起了初次见面时的细节。他让安妮意识到他曾经以最真诚的目光注视过她。她很熟悉这种目光；但还有另外一个人的目光使她不能忘怀。","However it might end, he was without any question their pleasantest acquaintance in Bath: she saw nobody equal to him; and it was a great indulgence now and then to talk to him about Lyme, which he seemed to have as lively a wish to see again, and to see more of, as herself.They went through the particulars of their first meeting a great many times.He gave her to understand that he had looked at her with some earnestness.She knew it well; and she remembered another person’s look also."
"他们的想法并不总是一致的。安妮觉得埃利奥特先生比她更看重地位与社会关系。他热忱地为她父亲和姐姐分担对某一件事的忧虑，不仅仅是出于殷勤，而且他自己也很关心安妮觉得不值得为之大惊小怪的事情。巴斯的报纸有一天早晨刊登了达尔林普尔子爵的遗孀还有她的女儿——尊敬的卡特雷特小姐来到巴斯的消息。于是多少天来，卡姆登巷的轻松气氛被一扫而光；因为达尔林普尔（在安妮看来，这是非常不幸的）是埃利奥特家族的表亲；沃尔特爵士感到伤心的是，不知道该如何合适地去拜访她们。","They did not always think alike.His value for rank and connexion she perceived was greater than hers.It was not merely complaisance, it must be a liking to the cause, which made him enter warmly into her father and sister’s solicitudes on a subject which she thought unworthy to excite them.The Bath paper one morning announced the arrival of the Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple, and her daughter, the Honourable Miss Carteret; and all the comfort of No.—, Camden Place, was swept away for many days; for the Dalrymples (in Anne’s opinion, most unfortunately) were cousins of the Elliots; and the agony was how to introduce themselves properly."
"安妮以前从未看到过她父亲和姐姐同贵族交往的情景，她必须承认她有些失望。父亲和姐姐对自己的社会地位看得很高，因此她原指望他们在这方面表现得更为得体一些，现在却降低到她以前从未有过的愿望，希望他们有较强的自尊心。因为她耳朵边整天听到的是“我们的表亲达尔林普尔夫人和卡特雷特小姐”，“我们的表亲达尔林普尔一家”。","Anne had never seen her father and sister before in contact with nobility, and she must acknowledge herself disappointed.She had hoped better things from their high ideas of their own situation in life, and was reduced to form a wish which she had never foreseen; a wish that they had more pride; for “our cousins Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret;” “our cousins, the Dalrymples,” sounded in her ears all day long."
"沃尔特爵士同已故子爵见过一次面，但从未见过他家的其他成员；困难在于自从子爵去世后，所有礼节性的通信联系都已经中断，这是因为子爵去世的时候，沃尔特爵士正在生重病，于是很遗憾的是，凯林奇府有所疏忽。他们没往爱尔兰发信吊唁。这种疏忽后来又降临到失礼者的头上；因为可怜的埃利奥特夫人去世时，凯林奇府也没有接到唁函，因而他们完全有理由认为，达尔林普尔一家觉得他们的关系早已结束。现在的问题是如何纠正这一令人忧心的误会，使对方再承认他们是表亲关系。拉塞尔夫人和埃利奥特先生虽然表现得更为理智，但是并不认为这个问题不重要。“亲戚关系总是值得维持的，好的伴侣总是值得寻找的；达尔林普尔夫人在劳拉巷租了一幢房子，为期三个月，生活上十分讲排场。上一年她来过巴斯，拉塞尔夫人听说她是一位非常迷人的夫人。如果可能，最好是既不损害埃利奥特家族的尊严，又能恢复亲戚关系。”","Sir Walter had once been in company with the late viscount, but had never seen any of the rest of the family; and the difficulties of the case arose from there having been a suspension of all intercourse by letters of ceremony, ever since the death of that said late viscount, when, in consequence of a dangerous illness of Sir Walter’s at the same time, there had been an unlucky omission at Kellynch.No letter of condolence had been sent to Ireland.The neglect had been visited on the head of the sinner; for when poor Lady Elliot died herself, no letter of condolence was received at Kellynch, and, consequently, there was but too much reason to apprehend that the Dalrymples considered the relationship as closed.How to have this anxious business set to rights, and be admitted as cousins again, was the question: and it was a question which, in a more rational manner, neither Lady Russell nor Mr. Elliot thought unimportant.“Family connexions were always worth preserving, good company always worth seeking; Lady Dalrymple had taken a house, for three months, in Laura Place, and would be living in style.She had been at Bath the year before, and Lady Russell had heard her spoken of as a charming woman.It was very desirable that the connexion should be renewed, if it could be done, without any compromise of propriety on the side of the Elliots.”"
"不过，沃尔特爵士要选择自己的办法，最后他写了一封非常客气的信，向他尊贵的表亲做了大量解释，表示了遗憾和恳求。拉塞尔夫人和埃利奥特先生都不看好这封信；但是它却达到了预期的目的，他们接到了子爵夫人草草两三行的回信。“甚感荣幸，很乐意同你们见面。”难关渡过了，甜头开始了。他们到劳拉巷登门拜访，又把达尔林普尔子爵夫人和尊敬的卡特雷特小姐的名片摆到最显眼的地方，逢人便说“我们在劳拉巷的表亲”——“我们的表亲达尔林普尔夫人和卡特雷特小姐”。","Sir Walter, however, would choose his own means, and at last wrote a very fine letter of ample explanation, regret, and entreaty, to his right honourable cousin.Neither Lady Russell nor Mr. Elliot could admire the letter; but it did all that was wanted, in bringing three lines of scrawl from the Dowager Viscountess.“She was very much honoured, and should be happy in their acquaintance.”The toils of the business were over, the sweets began.They visited in Laura Place, they had the cards of Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple, and the Honourable Miss Carteret, to be arranged wherever they might be most visible: and “Our cousins in Laura Place,”—“Our cousin, Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret,” were talked of to everybody."
"安妮感到羞愧。即使子爵夫人和她的女儿亲切和蔼，她也会为她们引起的骚动感到羞愧，何况她们没有什么了不起的。无论是风度、修养或是洞察力都没有出众的地方。达尔林普尔夫人之所以获得“一位迷人女人”的称号，是因为她总是笑容可掬，回起话来都礼貌周到。卡特雷特小姐更谈不上了，她相貌平平，行动笨拙，若不是因为出身高贵，卡姆登巷的人决不会容忍她的。","Anne was ashamed.Had Lady Dalrymple and her daughter even been very agreeable, she would still have been ashamed of the agitation they created, but they were nothing.There was no superiority of manner, accomplishment, or understanding.Lady Dalrymple had acquired the name of “a charming woman,” because she had a smile and a civil answer for everybody.Miss Carteret, with still less to say, was so plain and so awkward, that she would never have been tolerated in Camden Place but for her birth."
"拉塞尔夫人承认她原本以为情况会好一些。不过，“她们还是值得相识”，安妮大胆地向埃利奥特先生谈了她对她们两个人的看法，他认为她们本身并不出众，但是他仍然认为，她们作为亲戚，作为愉快的朋友以及能够在其周围汇集一群好伙伴，她们自有其价值。安妮笑着说道：","Lady Russell confessed she had expected something better; but yet “it was an acquaintance worth having;” and when Anne ventured to speak her opinion of them to Mr. Elliot, he agreed to their being nothing in themselves, but still maintained that, as a family connexion, as good company, as those who would collect good company around them, they had their value.Anne smiled and said,"
"“我认为，好朋友埃利奥特先生应该是聪明、见多识广、话题丰富的人，这才是我所认为的愉快的合作伙伴。”","“My idea of good company, Mr. Elliot, is the company of clever, well-informed people, who have a great deal of conversation; that is what I call good company.”"
"“你错了，”他温柔地说道，“那不是愉快的朋友，而是最愉快的朋友。愉快的朋友要求出身高贵、有教养和举止优雅，受教育程度如何还不是非常重要。出身高贵和举止优雅却必不可少；但是有点知识对愉快的朋友来说不是危险的事情，相反倒很有好处。我的堂妹安妮摇头了。她不满意。她太挑剔了。亲爱的堂妹啊，”（坐到她身边），“你比我认识的任何姑娘都有权挑剔，可是这有什么用呢？能使你感到高兴吗？同劳拉的这些女士交往，尽可能地利用这种交往，不是更聪明一些吗？你相信我好了，她们今年冬天肯定会成为巴斯的第一流人物，社会地位就是社会地位。人们知道你们是她们的亲戚，这就有利于你们一家（应该说我们一家）确立大家都希望的重要地位。”","“You are mistaken,” said he gently, “that is not good company; that is the best.Good company requires only birth, education, and manners, and with regard to education is not very nice.Birth and good manners are essential; but a little learning is by no means a dangerous thing in good company; on the contrary, it will do very well.My cousin Anne shakes her head.She is not satisfied.She is fastidious.My dear cousin” (sitting down by her), “you have a better right to be fastidious than almost any other woman I know; but will it answer?Will it make you happy?Will it not be wiser to accept the society of those good ladies in Laura Place, and enjoy all the advantages of the connexion as far as possible?You may depend upon it, that they will move in the first set in Bath this winter, and as rank is rank, your being known to be related to them will have its use in fixing your family (our family let me say) in that degree of consideration which we must all wish for.”"
"“是啊，”安妮叹气道，“人们确实会知道我们是她们的亲戚！”她突然想起来了，不想听到回答，因此她又接着说下去，“我的确认为为了获得这个交往，花费的力气太多了。我想，”（她微微一笑），“我的自尊心比你们哪一个都强。但是我承认，我们如此热切地要她们承认这种关系，的确让我很生气，而我们完全可以肯定，她们对这种关系完全不在乎。”","“Yes,” sighed Anne, “we shall, indeed, be known to be related to them!” then recollecting herself, and not wishing to be answered, she added, “I certainly do think there has been by far too much trouble taken to procure the acquaintance.I suppose” (smiling) “I have more pride than any of you; but I confess it does vex me, that we should be so solicitous to have the relationship acknowledged, which we may be very sure is a matter of perfect indifference to them.”"
"“请原谅我，亲爱的堂妹，你小看了你们自己拥有的权利。也许在伦敦，按照你们目前安静的生活方式，情况或许会像你说得那样。但是在巴斯，沃尔特•埃利奥特爵士和他的一家总是值得结识，总是被认作相识的人。”","“Pardon me, dear cousin, you are unjust in your own claims.In London, perhaps, in your present quiet style of living, it might be as you say: but in Bath; Sir Walter Elliot and his family will always be worth knowing: always acceptable as acquaintance.”"
"“好吧，”安妮说道，“我当然非常骄傲，骄傲到无法赏识那种完全取决于所处环境的受人欢迎方式。”","“Well,” said Anne, “I certainly am proud, too proud to enjoy a welcome which depends so entirely upon place.”"
"“我喜欢你的气愤，”他说，“这很自然。但是你这是在巴斯，目的是要在这里定居，建立应该属于沃尔特•埃利奥特爵士的荣誉和尊严。你谈到了你很骄傲，我知道，人们也说我骄傲，而我也不希望自己并非如此；因为要是研究一下我们的骄傲，它们的目的是相同的，这一点我毫无疑问，虽然说似乎有点差别。有一点我敢肯定，我亲爱的堂妹，”（他继续说道，压低了声音，虽然房间里没有别的人），“有一点我敢肯定，我们肯定会有同感。我们一定会感到，如果你父亲的亲友中增加一位与他地位平等或地位高于他的人，也许有利于把他的心思从身份较低的人身上转移开去。”","“I love your indignation,” said he; “it is very natural.But here you are in Bath, and the object is to be established here with all the credit and dignity which ought to belong to Sir Walter Elliot.You talk of being proud; I am called proud, I know, and I shall not wish to believe myself otherwise; for our pride, if investigated, would have the same object, I have no doubt, though the kind may seem a little different.In one point, I am sure, my dear cousin,” (he continued, speaking lower, though there was no one else in the room) “in one point, I am sure, we must feel alike.We must feel that every addition to your father’s society, among his equals or superiors, may be of use in diverting his thoughts from those who are beneath him.”"
"他说话时朝克莱太太刚刚坐过的位子上瞥了一眼，这就充分表明他那句话的含义。虽然安妮不相信他们有着同样的自豪感，但是她却仍为埃利奥特先生不喜欢克莱太太而感到高兴。安妮凭着良心承认，他之所以希望鼓励她父亲结识一些显贵的人既然是为了打败克莱太太，因此也就完全可以谅解。","He looked, as he spoke, to the seat which Mrs. Clay had been lately occupying: a sufficient explanation of what he particularly meant; and though Anne could not believe in their having the same sort of pride, she was pleased with him for not liking Mrs. Clay; and her conscience admitted that his wishing to promote her father’s getting great acquaintance was more than excusable in the view of defeating her."
"第十七章","CHAPTER 17"
"当沃尔特爵士和伊丽莎白在劳拉巷拼命地推进他们的好运的时候，安妮正在与一位气质迥异的故友重叙友情。","While Sir Walter and Elizabeth were assiduously pushing their good fortune in Laura Place, Anne was renewing an acquaintance of a very different description."
"她拜访了以前的老师，从她那里得知她有一位老同学住在巴斯，这位同学有两点很值得安妮关注，一是过去她对安妮很友好，二是她现在生活很悲惨。她原是汉密尔顿小姐，现在是史密斯夫人，曾在安妮一生中最需要帮助的时刻给了她友谊。那时安妮闷闷不乐地去上学，她为失去自己深爱的母亲而非常悲痛，又为离开家而难过，这对于一个十分敏感而又情绪低落的14岁小姑娘来说，在这种时刻一定会感到悲痛。汉密尔顿比她大三岁，由于没有近亲和固定的住所，所以还得在学校再呆上一年。她处处帮助安妮，对她十分体贴，大大减轻了安妮的痛苦，安妮每次想起这件事情就觉得十分感动。","She had called on her former governess, and had heard from her of there being an old school-fellow in Bath, who had the two strong claims on her attention of past kindness and present suffering.Miss Hamilton, now Mrs. Smith, had shewn her kindness in one of those periods of her life when it had been most valuable.Anne had gone unhappy to school, grieving for the loss of a mother whom she had dearly loved, feeling her separation from home, and suffering as a girl of fourteen, of strong sensibility and not high spirits, must suffer at such a time; and Miss Hamilton, three years older than herself, but still from the want of near relations and a settled home, remaining another year at school, had been useful and good to her in a way which had considerably lessened her misery, and could never be remembered with indifference."
"汉密尔顿小姐离开学校后不久就结婚了，据说嫁给了一个有钱人，这就是安妮以前所知道的她的一切情况，现在她们的老师对她的情况作了比较确切的介绍，但是却与安妮听说的大为不同。","Miss Hamilton had left school, had married not long afterwards, was said to have married a man of fortune, and this was all that Anne had known of her, till now that their governess’s account brought her situation forward in a more decided but very different form."
"她是个穷寡妇。她的丈夫一向挥霍成性，在大约两年前去世时，家境已经被他搞得一塌糊涂了。她既要应付种种困难，除了这些烦恼之外，她又得了严重的风湿病，结果影响了双腿，以致于现在成了瘸子。她正是为了治病来到了巴斯，现在住在温泉浴室附近的出租房间里，日子过得十分拮据，甚至连雇个佣人这么点享受也没有，当然也几乎是与世隔绝的。","She was a widow and poor.Her husband had been extravagant; and at his death, about two years before, had left his affairs dreadfully involved.She had had difficulties of every sort to contend with, and in addition to these distresses had been afflicted with a severe rheumatic fever, which, finally settling in her legs, had made her for the present a cripple.She had come to Bath on that account, and was now in lodgings near the hot baths, living in a very humble way, unable even to afford herself the comfort of a servant, and of course almost excluded from society."
"她们的女老师相信，埃利奥特小姐的探望一定会使史密斯太太感到愉快，因此安妮立即前去探望。她回到家，没有提起她听到些什么，也没有提起她要出去干什么。在那里，这不会引起应有的兴趣。她只是和拉塞尔夫人商量了一下，拉塞尔夫人完全体谅她的心情，很高兴照她的意愿并将她送到史密斯太太住所附近的西门大楼。","Their mutual friend answered for the satisfaction which a visit from Miss Elliot would give Mrs. Smith, and Anne therefore lost no time in going.She mentioned nothing of what she had heard, or what she intended, at home.It would excite no proper interest there.She only consulted Lady Russell, who entered thoroughly into her sentiments, and was most happy to convey her as near to Mrs. Smith’s lodgings in Westgate Buildings, as Anne chose to be taken."
"安妮去看望了史密斯太太，她们又重新恢复了交往，相互间的感情不仅重新燃起而且更加增进了。见面后的十分钟内，双方都有些尴尬和激动。她们阔别了12年，各自的形象同留在彼此脑海中的记忆有点不同了。12年的时光，安妮从一个充满青春活力、文静而又未发育完成的15岁少女变成了一位27岁的优雅可爱的女人，她面容美丽，只是不再年轻，举止谨慎得体，又总是很温柔。12年的时光，汉密尔顿从一个漂亮、发育良好、身体健康、对年长者的优越感充满信心的姑娘变成了一个贫穷、体弱、无助的寡妇，因此她把旧日受她保护的人的来访看作一种恩赐。但是这次会面中的尴尬气氛很快就过去了，留下来的只是对以往个人癖好的回忆和对流逝时光的畅谈带来的令人陶醉的温馨。","The visit was paid, their acquaintance re-established, their interest in each other more than re-kindled.The first ten minutes had its awkwardness and its emotion.Twelve years were gone since they had parted, and each presented a somewhat different person from what the other had imagined.Twelve years had changed Anne from the blooming, silent, unformed girl of fifteen, to the elegant little woman of seven-and-twenty, with every beauty except bloom, and with manners as consciously right as they were invariably gentle; and twelve years had transformed the fine-looking, well-grown Miss Hamilton, in all the glow of health and confidence of superiority, into a poor, infirm, helpless widow, receiving the visit of her former protegee as a favour; but all that was uncomfortable in the meeting had soon passed away, and left only the interesting charm of remembering former partialities and talking over old times."
"安妮发现史密斯太太还跟过去几乎完全得到她信赖时一样通情达理，态度和蔼，而她喜欢交谈和开朗的性情则出乎安妮的意料。无论是过去的放荡——她的确历尽了沧桑——还是现有的节制，无论是疾病还是悲伤，看起来都没有使她变得性格内向或意志消沉。","Anne found in Mrs. Smith the good sense and agreeable manners which she had almost ventured to depend on, and a disposition to converse and be cheerful beyond her expectation.Neither the dissipations of the past—and she had lived very much in the world—nor the restrictions of the present, neither sickness nor sorrow seemed to have closed her heart or ruined her spirits."
"第二次来访时，她谈得非常坦率，安妮也越发感到惊讶。她很难想象比史密斯太太更为凄凉的处境了。她非常爱她的丈夫：而他先她而去了。她过惯了富裕的生活：可是这一切都没有了。她没有孩子将她与生活和幸福再次联系起来，没有亲戚能帮她料理纷乱的家务事，她病弱的身体又使她难以支撑今后的生活。她的住处仅仅是一间嘈杂的客厅和后面一间昏暗的卧室，如果没有人搀扶，她还无法从一个房间走到另一个房间，整个房子里只有一个仆人可供使唤，因此除了让佣人把她送去温泉洗浴外，她从不出门。然而尽管如此，安妮有理由相信，史密斯太太的烦恼和消沉是短暂的，而忙碌和愉快却是长时间的。这怎么可能呢？安妮看着、观察着、思考着。她最后得出结论：这不仅仅是个性坚强或听天由命。逆来顺受者可能善于忍耐，深刻的理解力能使人表现果敢，但是史密斯太太还不止这些。她心理承受能力强，易于使自己得到慰藉，她能快速地将坏事变成好事，只要有事可做，便能从烦恼中解脱出来，这完全出于本性。这是上天给她最好的礼物；安妮认为她的朋友属于这样一种情况，上天仁慈的安排，几乎能抵消所有的缺陷。","In the course of a second visit she talked with great openness, and Anne’s astonishment increased.She could scarcely imagine a more cheerless situation in itself than Mrs. Smith’s.She had been very fond of her husband: she had buried him.She had been used to affluence: it was gone.She had no child to connect her with life and happiness again, no relations to assist in the arrangement of perplexed affairs, no health to make all the rest supportable.Her accommodations were limited to a noisy parlour, and a dark bedroom behind, with no possibility of moving from one to the other without assistance, which there was only one servant in the house to afford, and she never quitted the house but to be conveyed into the warm bath.Yet, in spite of all this, Anne had reason to believe that she had moments only of languor and depression, to hours of occupation and enjoyment.How could it be?She watched, observed, reflected, and finally determined that this was not a case of fortitude or of resignation only.A submissive spirit might be patient, a strong understanding would supply resolution, but here was something more; here was that elasticity of mind, that disposition to be comforted, that power of turning readily from evil to good, and of finding employment which carried her out of herself, which was from nature alone.It was the choicest gift of Heaven; and Anne viewed her friend as one of those instances in which, by a merciful appointment, it seems designed to counterbalance almost every other want."
"史密斯太太告诉她，有一段时间她几乎完全失去了勇气。同刚到巴斯相比，她现在已经不认为自己是一个残废人了。那时她的确是一个可怜虫。她在路上受了凉，刚找到住所的时候，又卧床不起，她忍受着持续不断的严重病痛。那时她周围全是陌生人，她急需一名正式护士，而她的手头特别拮据，根本无法支付额外的开支。然而，她已经挺过来了，可以真心诚意地说，当时那种处境对她有好处。她感觉到自己遇到了好人，就越发感到宽慰。她见过的世面太多了，所以根本没想到会在某个地方突然遇见无私的友情，但是这次生病使她意识到，房东太太为了维护自己的人格，不会欺侮她。特别幸运的是，她遇到了一位好护士，这位职业护士是房东的妹妹，当她没活干的时候，她总是呆在姐姐家里，而当时正好闲着，可以及时地照顾她。“她呀，”史密斯太太说道，“不仅悉心地照顾我，实际上已经成为我一个非常珍贵的朋友。我的手刚能动弹，她就教我织毛衣，这给我带来了很大的乐趣。她还教我做小针袋、针垫和卡架，你看见我总是忙这些小玩意，这样就使我能够帮助临近的一两家十分贫穷的家庭。她有一大帮朋友，当然是由于职业的关系，他们都买得起这些小玩意，因此她就负责推销我的这些货物。她总是能找到合适的时机去推销。你知道，当人们刚摆脱严重病痛，或者正在幸福地恢复健康，每个人的心扉总是敞开的，鲁克护士完全懂得何时开口。她是一个精明、机智、通情达理的女人。她的行业有利于看透人的本性。她富有理性、善于观察，作为伴侣，她比成千上万只受过‘世界上最好的教育’，却不知道什么事情值得做的人强得多。如果你愿意，就当我们是聊天吧，但是只要鲁克护士有半小时的空闲时间，她就会对我说一些有趣而且有益的事情：一些使我能更好地了解同类的事情。人们都想听听周围的事情，熟悉一下人们表现无聊和愚蠢的最新方式。对于我这种孤苦伶仃的人来说，我向你保证，她的谈话是一种乐趣。”","There had been a time, Mrs. Smith told her, when her spirits had nearly failed.She could not call herself an invalid now, compared with her state on first reaching Bath.Then she had, indeed, been a pitiable object; for she had caught cold on the journey, and had hardly taken possession of her lodgings before she was again confined to her bed and suffering under severe and constant pain; and all this among strangers, with the absolute necessity of having a regular nurse, and finances at that moment particularly unfit to meet any extraordinary expense.She had weathered it, however, and could truly say that it had done her good.It had increased her comforts by making her feel herself to be in good hands.She had seen too much of the world, to expect sudden or disinterested attachment anywhere, but her illness had proved to her that her landlady had a character to preserve, and would not use her ill; and she had been particularly fortunate in her nurse, as a sister of her landlady, a nurse by profession, and who had always a home in that house when unemployed, chanced to be at liberty just in time to attend her.“And she,” said Mrs. Smith, “besides nursing me most admirably, has really proved an invaluable acquaintance.As soon as I could use my hands she taught me to knit, which has been a great amusement; and she put me in the way of making these little thread-cases, pin-cushions and card-racks, which you always find me so busy about, and which supply me with the means of doing a little good to one or two very poor families in this neighbourhood.She had a large acquaintance, of course professionally, among those who can afford to buy, and she disposes of my merchandise.She always takes the right time for applying.Everybody’s heart is open, you know, when they have recently escaped from severe pain, or are recovering the blessing of health, and Nurse Rooke thoroughly understands when to speak.She is a shrewd, intelligent, sensible woman.Hers is a line for seeing human nature; and she has a fund of good sense and observation, which, as a companion, make her infinitely superior to thousands of those who having only received ‘the best education in the world,’ know nothing worth attending to.Call it gossip, if you will, but when Nurse Rooke has half an hour’s leisure to bestow on me, she is sure to have something to relate that is entertaining and profitable: something that makes one know one’s species better.One likes to hear what is going on, to be au fait as to the newest modes of being trifling and silly.To me, who live so much alone, her conversation, I assure you, is a treat.”"
"安妮不想对这种乐趣吹毛求疵，回答道：“我完全相信这一点。那个阶层的女子有很多机会理解生活，如果她们聪明的话，那倒可能很值得听她们说说。她们见到的人性真是形形色色！她们明白的不仅仅是人性的愚蠢；因为她们偶尔也能在任何场所见到人性中极有趣、极感人的一面。她们一定见过不少热忱、无私、克制的情感，英勇、坚强、忍耐、听天由命的情感，以及种种使我们变得高尚的冲突和牺牲。一间病室常常能提供写出几部有价值的书的素材。”","Anne, far from wishing to cavil at the pleasure, replied, “I can easily believe it.Women of that class have great opportunities, and if they are intelligent may be well worth listening to.Such varieties of human nature as they are in the habit of witnessing!And it is not merely in its follies, that they are well read; for they see it occasionally under every circumstance that can be most interesting or affecting.What instances must pass before them of ardent, disinterested, self-denying attachment, of heroism, fortitude, patience, resignation: of all the conflicts and all the sacrifices that ennoble us most.A sick chamber may often furnish the worth of volumes.”"
"“是的，”史密斯太太比较迟疑地说道，“有时会这样，不过恐怕这里的教育并不总像你描述的那样振奋。有时面对考验，人的本性可能会显得很伟大；但是一般来说，在病室里的人表现出来的是人性的软弱而不是人性的坚强。人们听到的是自私和焦躁，而不是宽容与刚毅。在这个世界上，真正的友谊太少了！不幸的是，”（低沉而颤抖地说）“等许多人要认认真真地思考一番时，已经为时太晚了。”","“Yes,” said Mrs. Smith more doubtingly, “sometimes it may, though I fear its lessons are not often in the elevated style you describe.Here and there, human nature may be great in times of trial; but generally speaking, it is its weakness and not its strength that appears in a sick chamber: it is selfishness and impatience rather than generosity and fortitude, that one hears of.There is so little real friendship in the world! and unfortunately” (speaking low and tremulously) “there are so many who forget to think seriously till it is almost too late.”"
"安妮懂得这种痛苦的感受。做丈夫的不成器，做妻子的便不得不生活在那样一群人中间，这就使她觉得世界比她想象得要糟糕得多。不过，对史密斯太太来说，这只不过是转瞬即逝的情绪。她摆脱了这种情绪，很快用一种不同的语气接着说道：","Anne saw the misery of such feelings.The husband had not been what he ought, and the wife had been led among that part of mankind which made her think worse of the world than she hoped it deserved.It was but a passing emotion however with Mrs. Smith; she shook it off, and soon added in a different tone—"
"“我觉得我的朋友鲁克太太现在的处境，既不能给我提供有趣的事情也不能启发我。她只是在护理莫尔伯勒大厦的沃利斯太太。我觉得她只不过是一个时髦漂亮、挥霍无度的愚蠢女人。当然，她除了蕾丝和华美的服饰之外，没有什么可说的。我倒想从沃利斯太太身上捞点油水。她有的是钱，我打算让她把我现在手头上的所有高价东西全都买去。”","“I do not suppose the situation my friend Mrs. Rooke is in at present, will furnish much either to interest or edify me.She is only nursing Mrs. Wallis of Marlborough Buildings; a mere pretty, silly, expensive, fashionable woman, I believe; and of course will have nothing to report but of lace and finery.I mean to make my profit of Mrs. Wallis, however.She has plenty of money, and I intend she shall buy all the high-priced things I have in hand now.”"
"安妮去看望了她的朋友几次之后，卡姆登巷的人才知道有这么一个人。终于，他们不得不说起她了。一天上午，沃尔特爵士、伊丽莎白和克莱太太从劳拉巷回到家里，突然接到达尔林普尔夫人的邀请，请他们当晚去做客，可是安妮早已有约，当晚要去西门大厦。她并不为自己去不成感到抱歉。她肯定，他们之所以受到邀请是因为达尔林普尔夫人得了重感冒，没法出门，所以便想利用这一门攀上来的亲戚。安妮满怀高兴地谢绝了——“我已跟一个老同学约好今晚去陪她。”他们对安妮的事情并不怎么感兴趣，但是还是提了不少问题，想了解这位老同学到底是什么样的人。伊丽莎白大为蔑视，而沃尔特爵士则很严厉。","Anne had called several times on her friend, before the existence of such a person was known in Camden Place.At last, it became necessary to speak of her.Sir Walter, Elizabeth and Mrs. Clay, returned one morning from Laura Place, with a sudden invitation from Lady Dalrymple for the same evening, and Anne was already engaged, to spend that evening in Westgate Buildings.She was not sorry for the excuse.They were only asked, she was sure, because Lady Dalrymple being kept at home by a bad cold, was glad to make use of the relationship which had been so pressed on her; and she declined on her own account with great alacrity—“She was engaged to spend the evening with an old schoolfellow.”They were not much interested in anything relative to Anne; but still there were questions enough asked, to make it understood what this old schoolfellow was; and Elizabeth was disdainful, and Sir Walter severe."
"“西门大楼！”他说道，“安妮•埃利奥特小姐要去西门大楼看望谁啊？一位史密斯太太。一位守寡的史密斯太太，她的丈夫是谁呢？到处可遇见的五千个史密斯太太中的一个。她有什么魅力？她又老又多病。说真的，安妮•埃利奥特小姐，你的情趣还真特别啊！别人所厌恶的一切：低贱的朋友、简陋的房间、恶臭的空气、令人厌恶的关系，这些对你却颇有吸引力。不过，你当然可以推迟到明天再去看望这一位老太太。我想，她还有希望再活一天。她多大年纪了？40了？”","“Westgate Buildings!” said he, “and who is Miss Anne Elliot to be visiting in Westgate Buildings?A Mrs. Smith.A widow Mrs. Smith; and who was her husband?One of five thousand Mr. Smiths whose names are to be met with everywhere.And what is her attraction?That she is old and sickly.Upon my word, Miss Anne Elliot, you have the most extraordinary taste!Everything that revolts other people, low company, paltry rooms, foul air, disgusting associations are inviting to you.But surely you may put off this old lady till to-morrow: she is not so near her end, I presume, but that she may hope to see another day.What is her age?Forty?”"
"“不，父亲，她还不到31岁，不过我想我的约会不能往后推，因为最近只有这一个晚上对她和我都合适。她明天就去洗温泉浴了，你知道，这一周剩余的时间我们都没有空。”","“No, sir, she is not one-and-thirty; but I do not think I can put off my engagement, because it is the only evening for some time which will at once suit her and myself.She goes into the warm bath to-morrow, and for the rest of the week, you know, we are engaged.”"
"“不过，拉塞尔夫人对这种交往有什么看法？”伊丽莎白问道。","“But what does Lady Russell think of this acquaintance?” asked Elizabeth."
"“她认为没有什么可指责的，”安妮回答道，“相反，她还支持。在我去看望史密斯太太的时候，通常她还会送我过去。","“She sees nothing to blame in it,” replied Anne; “on the contrary, she approves it, and has generally taken me when I have called on Mrs. Smith.”"
"“西门大厦的人见到一辆马车停在人行道附近，一定会大为惊讶，”沃尔特爵士说道，“的确，亨利•拉塞尔爵士的遗孀没有什么荣誉来炫耀她的徽章，不过那马车还是很漂亮的，毫无疑问，它是送一位埃利奥特小姐过来的。一位寡妇史密斯太太，住在西门大厦！一位三四十岁，勉强能活下来的可怜寡妇；一个普普通通的史密斯太太，一个平平常常的史密斯太太，安妮•埃利奥特小姐在世界上这么多人，这么多名门中就选中她做朋友，看得比她家在英格兰和爱尔兰的贵族亲戚还要重要！史密斯太太！就这么一个姓！”","“Westgate Buildings must have been rather surprised by the appearance of a carriage drawn up near its pavement,” observed Sir Walter.“Sir Henry Russell’s widow, indeed, has no honours to distinguish her arms, but still it is a handsome equipage, and no doubt is well known to convey a Miss Elliot.A widow Mrs. Smith lodging in Westgate Buildings!A poor widow barely able to live, between thirty and forty; a mere Mrs. Smith, an every-day Mrs. Smith, of all people and all names in the world, to be the chosen friend of Miss Anne Elliot, and to be preferred by her to her own family connections among the nobility of England and Ireland!Mrs. Smith!Such a name!”"
"他们说话的时候，克莱太太一直在场，现在觉得还是离开这间屋子好，安妮本来可以说很多话的，也确实想为她的朋友辩解几句，说她的朋友与他们的朋友没有什么差别，但是出于对父亲个人的尊重，她没有这么做。她没有回答。她让他父亲自己去想一想，史密斯太太不是巴斯唯一的年龄在30岁到40岁之间，没有多少钱养活自己，又不是出身名门的寡妇。","Mrs. Clay, who had been present while all this passed, now thought it advisable to leave the room, and Anne could have said much, and did long to say a little in defence of her friend’s not very dissimilar claims to theirs, but her sense of personal respect to her father prevented her.She made no reply.She left it to himself to recollect, that Mrs. Smith was not the only widow in Bath between thirty and forty, with little to live on, and no surname of dignity."
"安妮去赴自己的约会，其他人去赴他们的约会。当然，第二天早晨，她听说他们度过了一个愉快的晚上。她是这一群人中唯一缺席的，因为沃尔特爵士和伊丽莎白不仅本人为夫人阁下效劳，还高高兴兴地奉命为她邀集了其他人，费了好大力气去邀请拉塞尔夫人和埃利奥特先生。埃利奥特先生因此决定早点离开沃利斯上校，而拉塞尔夫人更是重新安排了她晚上所有的约会，以便能够拜访子爵夫人。安妮从拉塞尔夫人那里听来了关于这个晚上的全部情况。对她来说，最使她感兴趣的是，她的朋友和埃利奥特先生没少谈论她。他们希望她在场，为她感到惋惜，同时又为她去看望史密斯太太而不出席晚会而感到钦佩。安妮对这位疾病缠身、家道中落的老同学的亲切而富有同情心的看望似乎使埃利奥特先生感到很高兴。他认为她是一个与众不同的年轻女士。无论是性情、举止还是心灵，都是优秀女性的典范。他对安妮优点的谈论甚至还能使拉塞尔夫人感到满意。要不是拉塞尔夫人有意要引出这么多有趣的话题，安妮是不会了解这么多情况的，也不会知道她受到一位明智人这么高的评价。","Anne kept her appointment; the others kept theirs, and of course she heard the next morning that they had had a delightful evening.She had been the only one of the set absent, for Sir Walter and Elizabeth had not only been quite at her ladyship’s service themselves, but had actually been happy to be employed by her in collecting others, and had been at the trouble of inviting both Lady Russell and Mr. Elliot; and Mr. Elliot had made a point of leaving Colonel Wallis early, and Lady Russell had fresh arranged all her evening engagements in order to wait on her.Anne had the whole history of all that such an evening could supply from Lady Russell.To her, its greatest interest must be, in having been very much talked of between her friend and Mr. Elliot; in having been wished for, regretted, and at the same time honoured for staying away in such a cause.Her kind, compassionate visits to this old schoolfellow, sick and reduced, seemed to have quite delighted Mr. Elliot.He thought her a most extraordinary young woman; in her temper, manners, mind, a model of female excellence.He could meet even Lady Russell in a discussion of her merits; and Anne could not be given to understand so much by her friend, could not know herself to be so highly rated by a sensible man, without many of those agreeable sensations which her friend meant to create."
"现在，拉塞尔夫人已经对埃利奥特先生形成了明确的看法。她相信，他一定会娶安妮为妻的，而且他也完全配得上她。她开始算计，看看要多少个星期他才能从丧妻这一束缚中摆脱出来，才能公开地施展他取悦于人的高超本领。她不愿意在事情只有一半把握时就对安妮说，她只肯稍微暗示一下以后会发生什么事情，埃利奥特先生这边可能会产生感情，如果这份感情是真心实意的，而且也得到了对方的回应的话，这样的结合倒是很美满。安妮听了以后，没有表示强烈的惊讶；她只是笑了笑，红着脸，轻轻地摇了摇头。","Lady Russell was now perfectly decided in her opinion of Mr. Elliot.She was as much convinced of his meaning to gain Anne in time as of his deserving her, and was beginning to calculate the number of weeks which would free him from all the remaining restraints of widowhood, and leave him at liberty to exert his most open powers of pleasing.She would not speak to Anne with half the certainty she felt on the subject, she would venture on little more than hints of what might be hereafter, of a possible attachment on his side, of the desirableness of the alliance, supposing such attachment to be real and returned.Anne heard her, and made no violent exclamations; she only smiled, blushed, and gently shook her head."
"“你很清楚，我绝不是一个媒人，”拉塞尔夫人说，“因为我深知人事多变，难以预测。我只是想说，万一埃利奥特先生有朝一日向你求婚，你也愿意答应他的请求，我认为你们完全可以幸福地生活在一起。人人都会觉得这是一门最合适的结合，而我则认为，这是最幸福的结合。”","“I am no match-maker, as you well know,” said Lady Russell, “being much too well aware of the uncertainty of all human events and calculations.I only mean that if Mr. Elliot should some time hence pay his addresses to you, and if you should be disposed to accept him, I think there would be every possibility of your being happy together.A most suitable connection everybody must consider it, but I think it might be a very happy one.”"
"“埃利奥特先生是一位极其讨人喜欢的人，在很多方面我都很赞赏他，”安妮说道，“但是，我们可能不合适。”","“Mr. Elliot is an exceedingly agreeable man, and in many respects I think highly of him,” said Anne; “but we should not suit.”"
"拉塞尔夫人对这话并没有发表意见，只是回答说：“我承认如果能把你看作凯林奇未来的女主人，未来的埃利奥特夫人，能期望看到你能拥有你亲爱的母亲的地位，继承她的所有权利、声望与美德，对我将是莫大的满足。你的容貌和性情与你母亲一样，要是我能看到你能同她一样，有地位、有名誉、有家庭，在同一个地方主持家务并且赐福于人，而且比她更受尊重！那么我亲爱的安妮，那将会给我带来在我这个年纪不常感受到的快乐！”","Lady Russell let this pass, and only said in rejoinder, “I own that to be able to regard you as the future mistress of Kellynch, the future Lady Elliot, to look forward and see you occupying your dear mother’s place, succeeding to all her rights, and all her popularity, as well as to all her virtues, would be the highest possible gratification to me.You are your mother’s self in countenance and disposition; and if I might be allowed to fancy you such as she was, in situation and name, and home, presiding and blessing in the same spot, and only superior to her in being more highly valued!My dearest Anne, it would give me more delight than is often felt at my time of life!”"
"安妮不得不站起来，转过身去，走到远处一张桌子旁，靠在那里装作在忙什么事情，力图把刚才那番谈话引起的感情压制下去。一时间她的想象、她的心仿佛着了魔似的。一想到她将成为她母亲那样的人；想到“埃利奥特夫人”这个珍贵的头衔是她第一次将它复活；想到她要重新回到凯林奇，再次称它为家，她永久的家，这些对她来说是一时无法抵制的诱惑。拉塞尔夫人没有再说什么，她想让事情顺其自然。她认为，要是埃利奥特先生能够在这个时刻恰如其分地表白一番就好了！——总之，她以为安妮不相信会有这么一回事。安妮一想到埃利奥特先生自己来求婚的场景，她又镇静下来了。凯林奇和“埃利奥特夫人”的魅力也全部随之消失了。她决不会接受他的求婚。这不仅仅是因为她只钟情于一个人，对其他任何人都无法产生感情；而且她认认真真地考虑了这事的可能性，理智上是反对埃利奥特先生。","Anne was obliged to turn away, to rise, to walk to a distant table, and, leaning there in pretended employment, try to subdue the feelings this picture excited.For a few moments her imagination and her heart were bewitched.The idea of becoming what her mother had been; of having the precious name of “Lady Elliot” first revived in herself; of being restored to Kellynch, calling it her home again, her home for ever, was a charm which she could not immediately resist.Lady Russell said not another word, willing to leave the matter to its own operation; and believing that, could Mr. Elliot at that moment with propriety have spoken for himself!—she believed, in short, what Anne did not believe.The same image of Mr. Elliot speaking for himself brought Anne to composure again.The charm of Kellynch and of “Lady Elliot” all faded away.She never could accept him.And it was not only that her feelings were still adverse to any man save one; her judgement, on a serious consideration of the possibilities of such a case was against Mr. Elliot."
"虽说他们已经结识了一个月，但是她并不满意地认为自己真正了解他的品质。他是一个明智的人，一个讨人喜欢的人，他能说会道，颇有见地，似乎也能像富有原则的人一样能够对事情做出恰当的判断，这一切都是明摆着的。他当然能够明辨是非，安妮还没有发现他明显地违背了哪一条道德职责。然而，安妮仍然不能对他的行动打包票。她即使不怀疑埃利奥特的现在，也怀疑他的过去。他偶尔提及旧时的朋友，提到过去的一些活动和追求，使安妮对他的过去抱有一些怀疑，觉得他过去的行为有些不好。安妮发现他曾经有一些坏习惯；星期天出去游玩是家常便饭；而且他的生活中有一段时间（可能还不短）至少他对一切正经事毫不关心；虽然现在他可能改变了很多，但是谁能对一个聪明、谨慎，到了这个年纪又懂得要有正派品格的人的真情实感作出担保呢？怎样才能确定他已经洗心革面了呢？","Though they had now been acquainted a month, she could not be satisfied that she really knew his character.That he was a sensible man, an agreeable man, that he talked well, professed good opinions, seemed to judge properly and as a man of principle, this was all clear enough.He certainly knew what was right, nor could she fix on any one article of moral duty evidently transgressed; but yet she would have been afraid to answer for his conduct.She distrusted the past, if not the present.The names which occasionally dropt of former associates, the allusions to former practices and pursuits, suggested suspicions not favourable of what he had been.She saw that there had been bad habits; that Sunday travelling had been a common thing; that there had been a period of his life (and probably not a short one) when he had been, at least, careless in all serious matters; and, though he might now think very differently, who could answer for the true sentiments of a clever, cautious man, grown old enough to appreciate a fair character?How could it ever be ascertained that his mind was truly cleansed?"
"埃利奥特先生理智、谈吐谨慎、举止优雅，但是他并不坦率。他对别人的好坏从来没有激动过，也从不表示强烈的喜怒。这对安妮来说是显然是个缺陷。她早期的印象是无法补救的。她比任何人都珍视直率、坦诚、热切的性格。激情和热忱仍然使她着迷。她认为有些人有时看起来显得心不在焉，说上几句草率的话，但她宁愿信赖这些人的真诚，而不愿相信那些思想从来不溜神、舌头从来不滑边的人。","Mr. Elliot was rational, discreet, polished, but he was not open.There was never any burst of feeling, any warmth of indignation or delight, at the evil or good of others.This, to Anne, was a decided imperfection.Her early impressions were incurable.She prized the frank, the open-hearted, the eager character beyond all others.Warmth and enthusiasm did captivate her still.She felt that she could so much more depend upon the sincerity of those who sometimes looked or said a careless or a hasty thing, than of those whose presence of mind never varied, whose tongue never slipped."
"埃利奥特对谁都过于亲切。她父亲屋里人的性格各不相同，而他却都能使他们满意。他对谁都过于容忍，同每个人相处得太好了。他曾经比较坦率地同安妮谈起过克莱太太；他似乎对克莱太太是个什么样的人看得很清楚，因而很瞧不起她。可是克莱太太同其他人一样认为他很亲切。","Mr. Elliot was too generally agreeable.Various as were the tempers in her father’s house, he pleased them all.He endured too well, stood too well with every body.He had spoken to her with some degree of openness of Mrs. Clay; had appeared completely to see what Mrs. Clay was about, and to hold her in contempt; and yet Mrs. Clay found him as agreeable as any body."
"同安妮相比，拉塞尔夫人看问题的深度或许不如她，或许比她更透彻，因为她看不出有他什么能引起不信任的地方。拉塞尔夫人想不出一个比埃利奥特先生更完美的人。她希望这个秋天能在凯林奇的教堂里见到埃利奥特先生同她心爱的安妮举行婚礼。没有比这更令她愉快的事情了。","Lady Russell saw either less or more than her young friend, for she saw nothing to excite distrust.She could not imagine a man more exactly what he ought to be than Mr. Elliot; nor did she ever enjoy a sweeter feeling than the hope of seeing him receive the hand of her beloved Anne in Kellynch church, in the course of the following autumn."
"第十八章","CHAPTER 18"
"已经是2月初了。安妮已在巴斯呆了一个月，很渴望听到来自阿珀克罗斯和莱姆的消息。她想听的比玛丽在信中写的要多得多。安妮已经三个星期没有收到她的信了。她只知道亨里埃塔又回家了；而被认为恢复得很快的路易莎还留在莱姆。一天晚上，安妮正在一心惦念着他们的时候，收到了玛丽寄来的一封比平常都厚的信。使安妮更感到高兴与意外的是，克罗夫特将军与太太还向她表示问候。","It was the beginning of February; and Anne, having been a month in Bath, was growing very eager for news from Uppercross and Lyme.She wanted to hear much more than Mary had communicated.It was three weeks since she had heard at all.She only knew that Henrietta was at home again; and that Louisa, though considered to be recovering fast, was still in Lyme; and she was thinking of them all very intently one evening, when a thicker letter than usual from Mary was delivered to her; and, to quicken the pleasure and surprise, with Admiral and Mrs. Croft’s compliments."
"克罗夫特夫妇一定在巴斯！安妮对此很感兴趣。安妮心里挂念着他们。","The Crofts must be in Bath!A circumstance to interest her.They were people whom her heart turned to very naturally."
"“这是怎么回事儿？”沃尔特爵士大声喊道。“克罗夫特夫妇已经来到了巴斯？是租下了凯林奇的克罗夫特夫妇吗？他们给你带什么来了？”","“What is this?” cried Sir Walter.“The Crofts have arrived in Bath?The Crofts who rent Kellynch?What have they brought you?”"
"“阿珀克罗斯乡舍来的一封信，父亲。”","“A letter from Uppercross Cottage, Sir.”"
"“啊！这些信是方便的护照。它们可以当作是介绍信。不过，不管怎样，我本来也应该去拜访一下克罗夫特将军。我知道应该怎么对待我的房客。”","“Oh! those letters are convenient passports.They secure an introduction.I should have visited Admiral Croft, however, at any rate.I know what is due to my tenant.”"
"安妮再也听不下去了。她简直弄不清楚可怜的将军的面容是如何从她脑海中消失的。她专心致志地看信。这封信是几天前开始写的。","Anne could listen no longer; she could not even have told how the poor Admiral’s complexion escaped; her letter engrossed her.It had been begun several days back."
"“2月1日。”","“February 1st."
"”我亲爱的安妮——我不想因为没有给你写信而表示歉意，因为我知道在巴斯这种地方，很少有人对信感兴趣。你一定非常快乐，不会关心阿珀克罗斯了。你知道得很清楚，这里也没有什么事情可以告诉你。我们过了一个很无聊的圣诞节。整个节日期间，马斯格罗夫先生和太太没有准备过一次晚宴。我又不把海特一家放在眼里。不过，节日总算结束了：我想，没有一个孩子经历过这么漫长的节日。我保证我没有过。昨天，大家都走了，只留下哈维尔家的孩子了。你要是听到他们根本没有回来过，一定感到惊讶。哈维尔太太一定是一个古怪的母亲，能和孩子分开这么长时间。这一点，我无法理解。在我看来，他们根本就不乖；但是马斯格罗夫太太看上去非常喜欢他们，对待他们即使没有比对自己的孙子更好，但也差不多了。前一阵，我们这里的天气多糟糕！巴斯有漂亮的人行道，人们可能没有这样的感觉。但是在乡下，情况可就大为不同了。自从1月的第二个星期以来，除了查尔斯•海特之外，没有一个人来看过我，而查尔斯来的次数太多，我又不欢迎他了。对你说句悄悄话，亨里埃塔没有跟路易莎一起在莱姆呆下去，我觉得可真遗憾。否则，可以使她见到海特的次数少些。马车今天就出发了，明天要把路易莎和哈维尔太太接回来。不过，他们回来后的第二天，我们才应邀跟他们一起吃饭。马斯格罗夫太太非常担心路易莎在路上会受累，其实一路上有人照顾着，不太可能累着。要是明天去那儿吃饭，我倒方便了很多。我很高兴你觉得埃利奥特先生亲切，我也希望能够与他结识。可是我可倒霉了：每当有好事，我总是沾不上边；我总是家里最后一个引人注意的人。克莱太太同伊丽莎白呆在一起的时间太长了！她从来没有想过要走吗？不过即使她把房间腾出来，我们或许也不会受到邀请。告诉我，你对这事怎么看。你知道，我并不希望他们邀请我的孩子们。我完全可以把他们留在老宅一个月或六个星期。我刚刚听说，克罗夫特夫妇马上要去巴斯，他们认为将军得了痛风。查尔斯完全是偶然听到的，他们没有客气地通知我一下，或是表示愿意帮忙捎点东西过去。我认为，他们同我们的邻里关系没有什么进展。我们根本见不到他们，这足以证明他们多么心不在焉。查尔斯问你们好，祝你们万事如意。你亲爱的","“My dear Anne,—I make no apology for my silence, because I know how little people think of letters in such a place as Bath.You must be a great deal too happy to care for Uppercross, which, as you well know, affords little to write about.We have had a very dull Christmas; Mr. and Mrs. Musgrove have not had one dinner party all the holidays.I do not reckon the Hayters as anybody.The holidays, however, are over at last: I believe no children ever had such long ones.I am sure I had not.The house was cleared yesterday, except of the little Harvilles; but you will be surprised to hear they have never gone home.Mrs. Harville must be an odd mother to part with them so long.I do not understand it.They are not at all nice children, in my opinion; but Mrs. Musgrove seems to like them quite as well, if not better, than her grandchildren.What dreadful weather we have had!It may not be felt in Bath, with your nice pavements; but in the country it is of some consequence.I have not had a creature call on me since the second week in January, except Charles Hayter, who had been calling much oftener than was welcome.Between ourselves, I think it a great pity Henrietta did not remain at Lyme as long as Louisa; it would have kept her a little out of his way.The carriage is gone　to-day, to bring Louisa and the Harvilles tomorrow.We are not asked to dine with them, however, till the day after, Mrs. Musgrove is so afraid of her being fatigued by the journey, which is not very likely, considering the care that will be taken of her; and it would be much more convenient to me to dine there to-morrow.I am glad you find Mr. Elliot so agreeable, and wish I could be acquainted with him too; but I have my usual luck: I am always out of the way when any thing desirable is going on; always the last of my family to be noticed.What an immense time Mrs. Clay has been staying with Elizabeth!Does she never mean to go away?But perhaps if she were to leave the room vacant, we might not be invited.Let me know what you think of this.I do not expect my children to be asked, you know.I can leave them at the Great House very well, for a month or six weeks.I have this moment heard that the Crofts are going to Bath almost immediately; they think the Admiral gouty.Charles heard it quite by chance; they have not had the civility to give me any notice, or of offering to take anything.I do not think they improve at all as neighbours.We see nothing of them, and this is really an instance of gross inattention.Charles joins me in love, and everything proper.Yours affectionately,"
"“玛丽•马——","“Mary M—-."
"“我很遗憾地告诉你，我的身体很不好。杰迈玛刚告诉我，卖肉的说附近正流行咽喉炎。我看，我肯定会染上这个病，而我一染上咽喉炎，你知道，总是比别人严重。”","“I am sorry to say that I am very far from well; and Jemima has just told me that the butcher says there is a bad sore-throat very much about.I dare say I shall catch it; and my sore-throats, you know, are always worse than anybody’s.”"
"信的第一部分就这样结束了，后来玛丽把这一部分装进了一只信封，而在那封信里又另外写了这么多。","So ended the first part, which had been afterwards put into an envelope, containing nearly as much more."
"“我没有把信封上，因为我想告诉你路易莎路上的情况。我很高兴我没有封上，因为我还有好多话要说。首先，我昨天接到了克罗夫特太太的一张字条，说是他们愿意给你们捎东西。这确实是一张写得十分客气、十分友好的字条，是写给我的，理应如此。因此，我可以愿意把信写多长就写多长。将军的病看起来并不很重，我衷心地希望巴斯能够给他带来他所需要的一切。我真心欢迎他们再回来。我们的邻居中不能缺少这样友善的一家。不过，现在我要谈谈路易莎了。我有件事情要告诉你，你一定会大吃一惊。她和哈维尔太太星期二平安到家了，晚上我们去看望她时，惊讶地发现本威克舰长没有跟着一起来，因为他和哈维尔夫妇一起受到了邀请。你知道是什么原因吗？因为他不折不扣地爱上了路易莎，在得到马斯格罗夫先生的答复前，他不愿冒昧地来阿珀克罗斯。路易莎离开之前，他们已经谈好了，本威克舰长写了封信，托哈维尔上校带给她父亲。这件事千真万确，我以名誉担保！你不感到惊讶吗？要是你以前听到了什么风声，我至少会很吃惊的，因为我一点都不知道。马斯格罗夫太太郑重声明，她对此事毫不知情。不过，我们大家还是很高兴，因为虽说比不上嫁给温特沃思上校，但是却比嫁给查尔斯•海特好多了。马斯格罗夫先生已经写信表示同意，本威克舰长今天就要到这里来了。哈维尔太太说，她丈夫为他那可怜的妹妹感到十分难过。但是，他们俩人都非常喜欢路易莎。哈维尔太太和我的确都觉得，我们因为护理了她而更加喜爱她了。查尔斯想知道，温特沃思上校会说什么。不过，如果你还记得的话，我从不认为他爱上了路易莎，我从未发现这种迹象。你看，人们本以为本威克舰长是你的仰慕者，现在这事就这样了结了。我始终无法理解，查尔斯怎么会想到这方面去。我希望他现在会更加讨人喜欢了。当然，这对路易莎•马斯格罗夫不是一门非常美满的婚姻，不过这比嫁到海特家去强上百万倍。”","“I kept my letter open, that I might send you word how Louisa bore her journey, and now I am extremely glad I did, having a great deal to add.In the first place, I had a note from Mrs. Croft yesterday, offering to convey anything to you; a very kind, friendly note indeed, addressed to me, just as it ought; I shall therefore be able to make my letter as long as I like.The Admiral does not seem very ill, and I sincerely hope Bath will do him all the good he wants.I shall be truly glad to have them back again.Our neighbourhood cannot spare such a pleasant family.But now for Louisa.I have something to communicate that will astonish you not a little.She and the Harvilles came on Tuesday very safely, and in the evening we went to ask her how she did, when we were rather surprised not to find Captain Benwick of the party, for he had been invited as well as the Harvilles; and what do you think was the reason?Neither more nor less than his being in love with Louisa, and not choosing to venture to Uppercross till he had had an answer from Mr. Musgrove; for it was all settled between him and her before she came away, and he had written to her father by Captain Harville.True, upon my honour!Are not you astonished?I shall be surprised at least if you ever received a hint of it, for I never did.Mrs. Musgrove protests solemnly that she knew nothing of the matter.We are all very well pleased, however, for though it is not equal to her marrying Captain Wentworth, it is infinitely better than Charles Hayter; and Mr. Musgrove has written his consent, and Captain Benwick is expected to-day.Mrs. Harville says her husband feels a good deal on his poor sister’s account; but, however, Louisa is a great favourite with both.Indeed, Mrs. Harville and I quite agree that we love her the better for having nursed her.Charles wonders what Captain Wentworth will say; but if you remember, I never thought him attached to Louisa; I never could see anything of it.And this is the end, you see, of Captain Benwick’s being supposed to be an admirer of yours.How Charles could take such a thing into his head was always incomprehensible to me.I hope he will be more agreeable now.Certainly not a great match for Louisa Musgrove, but a million times better than marrying among the Hayters.”"
"玛丽不用担心她姐姐对这一消息会有什么思想准备。她一生中还从来没有这么惊讶过。本威克舰长和路易莎•马斯格罗夫！这简直奇妙地让人难以相信，安妮尽了最大的努力才勉强留在房间里，保持镇静，回答大家当时提出的一般性问题。幸好他们没有问太多问题。沃尔特爵士想知道的是，克罗夫特夫妇是否乘坐四驾马车，他们在巴斯的住址是否便于埃利奥特小姐和他自己登门拜访，但是除此之外，他就没有什么兴趣了。","Mary need not have feared her sister’s being in any degree prepared for the news.She had never in her life been more astonished.Captain Benwick and Louisa Musgrove!It was almost too wonderful for belief, and it was with the greatest effort that she could remain in the room, preserve an air of calmness, and answer the common questions of the moment.Happily for her, they were not many.Sir Walter wanted to know whether the Crofts travelled with four horses, and whether they were likely to be situated in such a part of Bath as it might suit Miss Elliot and himself to visit in; but had little curiosity beyond."
"“玛丽怎么样了？”伊丽莎白问了之后没等人回答，又说，“请问，是什么风把克罗夫特夫妇吹到巴斯来了？”","“How is Mary?” said Elizabeth; and without waiting for an answer, “And pray what brings the Crofts to Bath?”"
"“他们是为将军而来的。据说他得了痛风。”","“They come on the Admiral’s account.He is thought to be gouty.”"
"“痛风和衰老！”沃尔特爵士说道。“可怜的老绅士。”","“Gout and decrepitude!” said Sir Walter.“Poor old gentleman.”"
"“他们在这里有熟人吗？”伊丽莎白问道。","“Have they any acquaintance here?” asked Elizabeth."
"“我不知道，不过我想，以克罗夫特将军的年龄和职业，他在这种地方应该不会没有熟人。”","“I do not know; but I can hardly suppose that, at Admiral Croft’s time of life, and in his profession, he should not have many acquaintance in such a place as this.”"
"“我觉得，”沃尔特爵士冷冷地说，“克罗夫特将军在巴斯最出名的就是他是凯林奇府的租贷人。伊丽莎白，我们可以贸然地把他和他妻子引荐给子爵夫人吗？”","“I suspect,” said Sir Walter coolly, “that Admiral Croft will be best known in Bath as the renter of Kellynch Hall.Elizabeth, may we venture to present him and his wife in Laura Place?”"
"“哦，不！我想不行。尽管我们同达尔林普尔虽说是表亲关系，但是我们还是应该小心谨慎，不要把她不一定喜欢的熟人带去，这会使她感到尴尬的。如果我们不是亲戚，那倒没什么。但是作为表亲，她对我们的每项建议都会谨慎考虑的。我们最好还是让克罗夫特夫妇去结交他们自己那个层次的朋友吧。还有几个外表奇特的人在这里四处游荡。我听说他们是海员。克罗夫特夫妇会同他们结交的。”","“Oh, no!I think not.Situated as we are with Lady Dalrymple, cousins, we ought to be very careful not to embarrass her with acquaintance she might not approve.If we were not related, it would not signify; but as cousins, she would feel scrupulous as to any proposal of ours.We had better leave the Crofts to find their own level.There are several odd-looking men walking about here, who, I am told, are sailors.The Crofts will associate with them.”"
"这就是沃尔特爵士和伊丽莎白对这封信的兴趣。克莱太太倒是给了合乎礼节的关注，她询问了查尔斯太太和她那漂亮的小男孩。此后，安妮便脱身了。","This was Sir Walter and Elizabeth’s share of interest in the letter; when Mrs. Clay had paid her tribute of more decent attention, in an enquiry after Mrs. Charles Musgrove, and her fine little boys, Anne was at liberty."
"安妮回到自己的房间里，尽力想个明白。查尔斯想知道温特沃思上校是怎么想的，这很自然！也许，温特沃思上校已经退出了，放弃了路易莎，也许他已经不再爱路易莎了。也许他发现他根本不爱路易莎。安妮无法想象他和他的朋友之间会发生背信弃义或举止轻浮或类似这样不妥当的事情。她无法想象他们之间的友谊会不公平地中断。","In her own room, she tried to comprehend it.Well might Charles wonder how Captain Wentworth would feel!Perhaps he had quitted the field, had given Louisa up, had ceased to love, had found he did not love her.She could not endure the idea of treachery or levity, or anything akin to ill usage between him and his friend.She could not endure that such a friendship as theirs should be severed unfairly."
"本威克舰长和路易莎•马斯格罗夫。一个是兴致勃勃、能说会道的路易莎•马斯格罗夫，一个是忧郁、有思想、有感情、爱读书的本威克舰长，他们两个似乎一点也不般配。他们的思维方式相差甚远！哪里来的吸引力呢？答案很快就出现了。这是环境造成的。他们在一起生活了几个星期，他们一直住在同一个小屋里。自从亨里埃塔走了以后，他们肯定是相互依靠，路易莎病体刚刚开始恢复，处于一种需要别人关心的状态，而本威克舰长也不是不可安慰的。对于这一点，安妮过去不免有些察觉。不过她从当前事态的发展得出的结论，却与玛丽不同。当时的情况只能说明本威克舰长对安妮产生过几分柔情。不过，她并不想为了满足自己的虚荣心而从中大做文章，超过玛丽所允许的范围。她相信，任何一个比较讨人喜爱的年轻姑娘，只要倾听他的诉说，理解他的感情，都会博得他同样的赞美。他有一颗热情的心。他必定会爱上某个人。","Captain Benwick and Louisa Musgrove!The high-spirited, joyous-talking Louisa Musgrove, and the dejected, thinking, feeling, reading, Captain Benwick, seemed each of them everything that would not suit the other.Their minds most dissimilar!Where could have been the attraction?The answer soon presented itself.It had been in situation.They had been thrown together several weeks; they had been living in the same small family party: since Henrietta’s coming away, they must have been depending almost entirely on each other, and Louisa, just recovering from illness, had been in an interesting state, and Captain Benwick was not inconsolable.That was a point which Anne had not been able to avoid suspecting before; and instead of drawing the same conclusion as Mary, from the present course of events, they served only to confirm the idea of his having felt some dawning of tenderness toward herself.She did not mean, however, to derive much more from it to gratify her vanity, than Mary might have allowed.She was persuaded that any tolerably pleasing young woman who had listened and seemed to feel for him would have received the same compliment.He had an affectionate heart.He must love somebody."
"安妮没有理由认为他们不幸福。路易莎一开始就很喜欢海军军官，不久他们就会变得更加相像。本威克上校很快就会变得快活起来，路易莎会努力成为司各特和拜伦勋爵的热衷者。不，她也许已经做到了，他们当然是通过诗歌而相爱的。一想到路易莎•马斯格罗夫已经变成了具有文学品味和多愁善感的人，她就觉得很有趣，不过她并不怀疑情况确实如此。在莱姆的那一天，在科布摔的那一跤，可能会影响她一生的健康、精神、勇气和性格，就像目前似乎已经彻底影响了她的命运一样。","She saw no reason against their being happy.Louisa had fine naval fervour to begin with, and they would soon grow more alike.He would gain cheerfulness, and she would learn to be an enthusiast for Scott and Lord Byron; nay, that was probably learnt already; of course they had fallen in love over poetry.The idea of Louisa Musgrove turned into a person of literary taste, and sentimental reflection was amusing, but she had no doubt of its being so.The day at Lyme, the fall from the Cobb, might influence her health, her nerves, her courage, her character to the end of her life, as thoroughly as it appeared to have influenced her fate."
"整个事情的结论就是：如果说那位了解温特沃思上校人品的人会选择另外一个男人，那么他们的婚约也不会引起她持久的惊叹了。如果温特沃思上校也不曾因此失去朋友，当然也没有什么可遗憾的。不，安妮一想到温特沃思上校被解除了束缚而得到了自由，心跳不由得加速，脸上也泛起了红晕，这绝对不是因为遗憾。她有一些感情是她自己都羞于揣摩的。目前的感情近乎喜悦，莫名的喜悦！","The conclusion of the whole was, that if the woman who had been sensible of Captain Wentworth’s merits could be allowed to prefer another man, there was nothing in the engagement to excite lasting wonder; and if Captain Wentworth lost no friend by it, certainly nothing to be regretted.No, it was not regret which made Anne’s heart beat in spite of herself, and brought the colour into her cheeks when she thought of Captain Wentworth unshackled and free.She had some feelings which she was ashamed to investigate.They were too much like joy, senseless joy!"
"她渴望见到克罗夫特夫妇，但是见面时，他们显然还没有听说这个消息。双方都进行了礼节性的拜访和回访，提到了路易莎•马斯格罗夫，也提到了本威克舰长，但是他们脸上没露出一丝笑容。","She longed to see the Crofts; but when the meeting took place, it was evident that no rumour of the news had yet reached them.The visit of ceremony was paid and returned; and Louisa Musgrove was mentioned, and Captain Benwick, too, without even half a smile."
"使沃尔特爵士非常满意的是，克罗夫特夫妇住在盖伊街的房子里。他一点也不为这位朋友感到羞耻，实际上，他对将军的思考和议论远远超过将军对他的思考和议论。","The Crofts had placed themselves in lodgings in Gay Street, perfectly to Sir Walter’s satisfaction.He was not at all ashamed of the acquaintance, and did, in fact, think and talk a great deal more about the Admiral, than the Admiral ever thought or talked about him."
"克罗夫特将军在巴斯的熟人要多少有多少，他们把同埃利奥特一家的交往仅仅看作是一种礼节，看来也根本不能给他们带来愉快。他们把在乡下的习惯也带来了，几乎是形影不离的。克罗夫特将军遵照医生的嘱咐，通过散步来消除痛风，克罗夫特夫人似乎要与他分担一切事情，为了对他病好，拼命地陪他散步。安妮走到哪里都能遇见他们。拉塞尔夫人的马车几乎每天早上都要带安妮出去。这时，安妮总会想起他们，也总是会见到他们。安妮了解克罗夫特夫妇的感情，觉得对她来说，这是最感人、最幸福的情景。她总是尽量看着他们，看见他们单独在一起时愉快地散步，便高兴地以为自己可能知道他们在谈论些什么。她还很高兴看到克罗夫特将军遇到老朋友时彼此亲切握手的场面。她喜欢观察他们夫妇在一群海军中热情谈话的情景，这时克罗夫特太太看上去跟她周围的军官一样机智而敏捷。","The Crofts knew quite as many people in Bath as they wished for, and considered their intercourse with the Elliots as a mere matter of form, and not in the least likely to afford them any pleasure.They brought with them their country habit of being almost always together.He was ordered to walk to keep off the gout, and Mrs. Croft seemed to go shares with him in everything, and to walk for her life to do him good.Anne saw them wherever she went.Lady Russell took her out in her carriage almost every morning, and she never failed to think of them, and never failed to see them.Knowing their feelings as she did, it was a most attractive picture of happiness to her.She always watched them as long as she could, delighted to fancy she understood what they might be talking of, as they walked along in happy independence, or equally delighted to see the Admiral’s hearty shake of the hand when he encountered an old friend, and observe their eagerness of conversation when occasionally forming into a little knot of the navy, Mrs. Croft looking as intelligent and keen as any of the officers around her."
"安妮总是同拉塞尔夫人在一起，很少自己一个人出来散步。但是，事有碰巧，在克罗夫特夫妇到来的一星期或十天左右，一天上午在贫民区时，安妮离开了她的朋友，或者说离开了她朋友的马车，独自回卡姆登巷去。正当她走过米尔萨姆街的时候，幸运地遇见了将军。当时他正背着双手，独自站在一家版画店的橱窗前，专心致志地欣赏着版画。她就是从他身旁走过去，他也不会看得见，她只得拍他一下，喊他一声，才会引起他的注意。不过，他看到并认出了安妮时，言谈举止一如往常坦率友好。“哈！是你呀？谢谢你，谢谢你。你这么做正是把我当作朋友看待。你看，我正在看一幅画。我路过这一家店时总是要停下来。不过这是个什么玩意，像一艘船。你看看。你见过这样的船吗？那些杰出的画家肯定都是怪人，竟然会以为有人敢把生命托付给这样一艘不像样的破旧小船？不成想，还真有两个绅士悠然自得地呆在船上，望着周围的岩石和群山，好像不会马上翻船似的，其实，他们一定会翻船。我倒想知道这船是哪儿造的！”（爽朗地大笑）“乘坐这种船，我连洗马池都不敢过。好吧，”（转过脸去）“现在你要去哪儿？我能替你去，或陪你去吗？我能帮上什么忙吗？”","Anne was too much engaged with Lady Russell to be often walking herself; but it so happened that one morning, about a week or ten days after the Croft’s arrival, it suited her best to leave her friend, or her friend’s carriage, in the lower part of the town, and return alone to Camden Place, and in walking up Milsom Street she had the good fortune to meet with the Admiral.He was standing by himself at a printshop window, with his hands behind him, in earnest contemplation of some print, and she not only might have passed him unseen, but was obliged to touch as well as address him before she could catch his notice.When he did perceive and acknowledge her, however, it was done with all his usual frankness and good humour.“Ha! is it you?Thank you, thank you.This is treating me like a friend.Here I am, you see, staring at a picture.I can never get by this shop without stopping.But what a thing here is, by way of a boat!Do look at it.Did you ever see the like?What queer fellows your fine painters must be, to think that anybody would venture their lives in such a shapeless old cockleshell as that?And yet here are two gentlemen stuck up in it mightily at their ease, and looking about them at the rocks and mountains, as if they were not to be upset the next moment, which they certainly must be.I wonder where that boat was built!” (laughing heartily); “I would not venture over a horsepond in it.Well,” (turning away), “now, where are you bound?Can I go anywhere for you, or with you?Can I be of any use?”"
"“不用了，谢谢你。如果你能陪我在咱们同路的这短短的一段距离里走走，我就已经很高兴了。我要回家去。”","“None, I thank you, unless you will give me the pleasure of your company the little way our road lies together.I am going home.”"
"“我很乐意，非常乐意，多走一段也行。是的，是的，我们可以舒舒服服地在一起散散步，我一边走一边还要告诉你一件事。好了，挽着我的胳膊，这就对了。我身边要是没有一位女士，我会感到很不舒服的。天哪！那是什么船哪！”他们开始离开的时候，将军又朝那版画看了一眼。","“That I will, with all my heart, and farther, too.Yes, yes we will have a snug walk together, and I have something to tell you as we go along.There, take my arm; that’s right; I do not feel comfortable if I have not a woman there.Lord! what a boat it is!” taking a last look at the picture, as they began to be in motion."
"“你说有事情要告诉我，先生？”","“Did you say that you had something to tell me, sir?”"
"“是的，有事，马上就告诉你。可是那儿来了一位朋友，是布里格登上校，我们照面的时候，我只说一句‘你好’。我不会停下来的。‘你好’。布里格登看到我不是同妻子在一起，眼睛都睁大了。我妻子真可怜，她的一只脚把她拴住了。她的一只脚后跟上长了个水疱，有三先令的硬币那么大。你如果朝马路对面看，你就会看到布兰德将军和他的弟弟走过来了。卑鄙的家伙，两个都是！我很高兴他们没有走在路的这边。索菲受不了他们。他们曾经给我耍了一个卑鄙的花招：把我手下最好的人拐走了。详细情况我下一次再告诉你。阿奇博尔德•德鲁老爵士和他的孙子走来了。看，他看到我们了。他冲你吻手呢，他把你当成我妻子了。啊！对那个年轻人来说，和平来得太早了。可怜的阿奇博尔德老爵士！埃利奥特小姐，你喜欢巴斯吗？这个地方非常适合我们。我们经常会遇见这个或那个老朋友。每天早晨，街上满是我们的朋友，当然聊起来没完没了。然后，我们干脆摆脱他们，把自己关在屋子里，缩在椅子上。我们就像在凯林奇一样舒服，甚至就像我们以前在北雅茅斯和迪尔一样。实话告诉你吧，我们在这里的房子使我们想起了我们当初在北雅茅斯的住房，但是我们并不是不喜欢这里。跟在北雅茅斯一样，这里的一只壁炉是透风的。”","“Yes, I have, presently.But here comes a friend, Captain Brigden; I shall only say, ‘How d’ye do?’ as we pass, however.I shall not stop.‘How d’ye do?’Brigden stares to see anybody with me but my wife.She, poor soul, is tied by the leg.She has a blister on one of her heels, as large as a three-shilling piece.If you look across the street, you will see Admiral Brand coming down and his brother.Shabby fellows, both of them!I am glad they are not on this side of the way.Sophy cannot bear them.They played me a pitiful trick once: got away with some of my best men.I will tell you the whole story another time.There comes old Sir Archibald Drew and his grandson.Look, he sees us; he kisses his hand to you; he takes you for my wife.Ah! the peace has come too soon for that younker.Poor old Sir Archibald!How do you like Bath, Miss Elliot?It suits us very well.We are always meeting with some old friend or other; the streets full of them every morning; sure to have plenty of chat; and then we get away from them all, and shut ourselves in our lodgings, and draw in our chairs, and are snug as if we were at Kellynch, ay, or as we used to be even at North Yarmouth and Deal.We do not like our lodgings here the worse, I can tell you, for putting us in mind of those we first had at North Yarmouth.The wind blows through one of the cupboards just in the same way.”"
"他们又往前走了一段路，安妮又大胆地催促将军告诉她什么事。她原以为走出米尔萨姆街，她的好奇心就会得到满足。但是她还得等待，因为在他们走到更加宽阔、更加安静的贝尔蒙特街以前，将军不愿意谈。因为安妮不是真正的克罗夫特太太，她就只好由着他了。两人一走上贝尔蒙特街，将军就开口了：","When they were got a little farther, Anne ventured to press again for what he had to communicate.She hoped when clear of Milsom Street to have her curiosity gratified; but she was still obliged to wait, for the Admiral had made up his mind not to begin till they had gained the greater space and quiet of Belmont; and as she was not really Mrs. Croft, she must let him have his own way. As soon as they were fairly ascending Belmont, he began—"
"“好了，现在你会听到一件使你吃惊的事了。不过，首先你得告诉我，我要谈起的那位姑娘叫什么名字。你知道的，就是我们大家都非常关心的那位小姐。那个出了事的马斯格罗夫小姐。她的教名：我总是忘记她的教名。”","“Well, now you shall hear something that will surprise you.But first of all, you must tell me the name of the young lady I am going to talk about.That young lady, you know, that we have all been so concerned for.The Miss Musgrove, that all this has been happening to.Her Christian name: I always forget her Christian name.”"
"安妮一听就知道是谁，不过她不好意思显出一听就明白的样子。但是现在她可以放心地说出“路易莎”这个名字了。","Anne had been ashamed to appear to comprehend so soon as she really did; but now she could safely suggest the name of “Louisa.”"
"“对，对，路易莎小姐，就是那个名字。我希望年轻小姐们不要起这么多动听的教名。要是她们都叫索菲之类的名字，我就永远都忘不了的。好了，你知道，我们都以为这位路易莎小姐要嫁给弗雷德里克。弗雷德里克追她很久了。大家唯一感到奇怪的是，他们在等什么，后来直到路易莎在莱姆出了这件事。那时确实很显然他们必须等路易莎的头脑恢复过来。可是，即使在那个时候，他们的举动也很反常。弗雷德里克没有呆在莱姆，反而到普利茅斯去了，然后又跑去看爱德华。我们从迈恩黑德回来的时候，他已经去爱德华那里了，到现在为止一直在那里呆着。自从11月份以来，我们就没有见到他的影子。连索菲都无法理解。但是现在，事情发生了极其奇怪的变化。因为这位年轻的小姐，就是这位马斯格罗夫，没有嫁给弗雷德里克，而是要嫁给詹姆斯•本威克。你认识詹姆斯•本威克吧？”","“Ay, ay, Miss Louisa Musgrove, that is the name.I wish young ladies had not such a number of fine Christian names.I should never be out if they were all Sophys, or something of that sort.Well, this Miss Louisa, we all thought, you know, was to marry Frederick.He was courting her week after week.The only wonder was, what they could be waiting for, till the business at Lyme came; then, indeed, it was clear enough that they must wait till her brain was set to right.But even then there was something odd in their way of going on.Instead of staying at Lyme, he went off to Plymouth, and then he went off to see Edward.When we came back from Minehead he was gone down to Edward’s, and there he has been ever since.We have seen nothing of him since November.Even Sophy could not understand it.But now, the matter has take the strangest turn of all; for this young lady, the same Miss Musgrove, instead of being to marry Frederick, is to marry James Benwick.You know James Benwick.”"
"“有点。我与本威克舰长有点认识。”","“A little.I am a little acquainted with Captain Benwick.”"
"对了，路易莎就是要嫁给他。不，极有可能他们现在已经结婚了，因为我不知道他们还要等什么。”","“Well, she is to marry him.Nay, most likely they are married already, for I do not know what they should wait for.”"
"“我认为本威克舰长是一个非常讨人喜欢的年轻人，”安妮说，“而且我觉得他的人品很好。”","“I thought Captain Benwick a very pleasing young man,” said Anne, “and I understand that he bears an excellent character.”"
"“啊！是的，是的，詹姆斯•本威克是无可指责的。不错，他只是一位中校，去年夏天晋升的，现在就很难晋升了。不过除此之外，我不知道他还有什么缺点。我向你担保，他是一个优秀、心地善良的小伙子。也是一位积极、热忱的青年军官，这一点也许你想不到吧，因为从他那温和的举止上看不出来。”","“Oh! yes, yes, there is not a word to be said against James Benwick.He is only a commander, it is true, made last summer, and these are bad times for getting on, but he has not another fault that I know of.An excellent, good-hearted fellow, I assure you; a very active, zealous officer too, which is more than you would think for, perhaps, for that soft sort of manner does not do him justice.”"
"“这你就错了，先生。我决不会根据本威克舰长的举止就觉得他缺乏斗志。我觉得他的举止特别讨人喜欢，我敢担保，他能使大家都感到愉快。”","“Indeed you are mistaken there, sir; I should never augur want of spirit from Captain Benwick’s manners.I thought them particularly pleasing, and I will answer for it, they would generally please.”"
"“好了，好了，女士们最善于判断。但是我认为詹姆斯•本威克太柔了一些。可是这也许是我们的偏见，索菲和我都总觉得弗雷德里克的举止比他强。弗雷德里克身上某些方面更合我们的意。”","“Well, well, ladies are the best judges; but James Benwick is rather too piano for me; and though very likely it is all our partiality, Sophy and I cannot help thinking Frederick’s manners better than his.There is something about Frederick more to our taste.”"
"安妮一时不知道说什么才好。刚才她只是想反对大家普遍认为的斗志和温和水火不相容的观点，根本不是想说本威克的举止最为优雅。于是她迟疑了一会儿说：“我并不是想拿这两位朋友做比较。”但是将军打断了她的话：","Anne was caught.She had only meant to oppose the too common idea of spirit and gentleness being incompatible with each other, not at all to represent Captain Benwick’s manners as the very best that could possibly be; and, after a little hesitation, she was beginning to say, “I was not entering into any comparison of the two friends,” but the Admiral interrupted her with—"
"“情况确实如此。它并不只是流言蜚语。我们是听弗雷德里克自己说的。昨天他姐姐收到了他的一封信，信中他把这事告诉了我们。他也是刚从哈维尔的信中得知，哈维尔是当场从阿珀克罗斯写给他的。我想他们都在阿珀克罗斯。”","“And the thing is certainly true.It is not a mere bit of gossip.We have it from Frederick himself.His sister had a letter from him yesterday, in which he tells us of it, and he had just had it in a letter from Harville, written upon the spot, from Uppercross.I fancy they are all at Uppercross.”"
"这是安妮抵挡不住的一次机会。因此她说：“我想，将军，我想温特沃思上校信中的语气没有使你和克罗夫特太太感到特别不安吧。去年秋天，他和路易莎之间看上去确实有些感情。不过我想双方可能觉得感情已经淡漠了，他们也没有什么大吵大闹。我希望他的信中没有流露出受委屈的情绪吧。”","This was an opportunity which Anne could not resist; she said, therefore, “I hope, Admiral, I hope there is nothing in the style of Captain Wentworth’s letter to make you and Mrs. Croft particularly uneasy.It did seem, last autumn, as if there were an attachment between him and Louisa Musgrove; but I hope it may be understood to have worn out on each side equally, and without violence.I hope his letter does not breathe the spirit of an ill-used man.”"
"“一点没有，一点没有。从头到尾没有一句诅咒或怨言。”","“Not at all, not at all; there is not an oath or a murmur from beginning to end.”"
"安妮垂下眼帘，来掩饰她的笑容。","Anne looked down to hide her smile."
"“不，不。弗雷德里克不是一个抱怨和发牢骚的人。他很有志气，不会那么做。如果一个姑娘更喜欢另一个男人，那她嫁给那个人会更合适。”","“No, no; Frederick is not a man to whine and complain; he has too much spirit for that.If the girl likes another man better, it is very fit she should have him.”"
"“当然。但是我的意思是，我希望从温特沃思上校给你们写信的方式来看，没有什么东西使你们觉得他认为自己受到了朋友的亏待，你知道，这种心情不需要说也能流露出来。他和本威克舰长之间如此深厚的友谊要是因为这件事而受到破坏，或者哪怕是损害，我将感到很遗憾。”","“Certainly.But what I mean is, that I hope there is nothing in Captain Wentworth’s manner of writing to make you suppose he thinks himself ill-used by his friend, which might appear, you know, without its being absolutely said.I should be very sorry that such a friendship as has subsisted between him and Captain Benwick should be destroyed, or even wounded, by a circumstance of this sort.”"
"“是的，是的，我明白你的意思。不过信中根本没有这种情绪。他一点也没有讽刺挖苦本威克。他甚至没有说：‘我对此感到很奇怪，我有理由对此感到奇怪。’不，你从他的用词中都看不出他曾经看上过这位小姐。（她叫什么名字来着？）他非常大方地希望他们在一起能够幸福。而且我觉得字里行间没有什么不可原谅的怨恨的意思。”","“Yes, yes, I understand you.But there is nothing at all of that nature in the letter.He does not give the least fling at Benwick; does not so much as say, ‘I wonder at it, I have a reason of my own for wondering at it.’ No, you would not guess, from his way of writing, that he had ever thought of this Miss (what’s her name?)for himself.He very handsomely hopes they will be happy together; and there is nothing very unforgiving in that, I think.”"
"安妮并不完全接受将军极力想让安妮信服的一切，但是她已经不需要再继续追问下去了。因此，她只是泛泛地评论了几句，要不就是静静地听着，而将军也一心按照自己的思路说下去。","Anne did not receive the perfect conviction which the Admiral meant to convey, but it would have been useless to press the enquiry farther.She therefore satisfied herself with common-place remarks or quiet attention, and the Admiral had it all his own way."
"“可怜的弗雷德里克！”他最后说道。“现在他得重新和别的姑娘接触了。我想我们应该把他带到巴斯来。索菲应该写信给他，请他到巴斯来。我肯定，这里有足够多的漂亮姑娘。他再去阿珀克罗斯也没用了，因为我发现另一位马斯格罗夫小姐已经同她的表哥，那位年轻的教区长确定了关系。埃利奥特小姐，你不觉得我们最好请他到巴斯来吗？”","“Poor Frederick!” said he at last.“Now he must begin all over again with somebody else.I think we must get him to Bath.Sophy must write, and beg him to come to Bath.Here are pretty girls enough, I am sure.It would be of no use to go to Uppercross again, for that other Miss Musgrove, I find, is bespoke by her cousin, the young parson.Do not you think, Miss Elliot, we had better try to get him to Bath?”"
"第十九章","CHAPTER 19"
"就在克罗夫特将军一边与安妮散步，一边表示希望请温特沃思上校来巴斯的时候，温特沃思上校已经在来巴斯的路上了。克罗夫特太太还没来得及写信，他就到了。安妮下一次出去散步的时候就看见了他。","While Admiral Croft was taking this walk with Anne, and expressing his wish of getting Captain Wentworth to Bath, Captain Wentworth was already on his way thither.Before Mrs. Croft had written, he was arrived, and the very next time Anne walked out, she saw him."
"当时，埃利奥特先生正陪着他的两个堂妹和克莱太太。他们在米尔萨姆街上。开始下雨了，雨不大，但是足以使女士们希望找个避雨处，也足以使埃利奥特小姐巴望停在不远处的达尔林普尔子爵夫人的马车送她回家。因此，埃利奥特小姐、安妮和克莱太太走进了莫兰商店，而埃利奥特先生则走到达尔林普尔夫人面前，请求她的帮助。他很快就回到他们中间，当然，事情办成了。达尔林普尔夫人非常乐意送他们回家，几分钟后就过来接他们。","Mr. Elliot was attending his two cousins and Mrs. Clay.They were in Milsom Street.It began to rain, not much, but enough to make shelter desirable for women, and quite enough to make it very desirable for Miss Elliot to have the advantage of being conveyed home in Lady Dalrymple’s carriage, which was seen waiting at a little distance; she, Anne, and Mrs. Clay, therefore, turned into Molland’s, while Mr. Elliot stepped to Lady Dalrymple, to request her assistance.He soon joined them again, successful, of course; Lady Dalrymple would be most happy to take them home, and would call for them in a few minutes."
"子爵夫人阁下的车子是一辆四轮大马车，只能坐四个人，人多了就不舒服了。卡特雷特小姐同她母亲在一起，因此卡姆登巷的三位女士不能指望都坐上车去。埃利奥特小姐无疑是要坐上去的。无论谁有什么不便，她也不能承受不便，不过解决另外两个人的谦让问题却花费了一番功夫。雨很小，安妮极其恳切地希望能同埃利奥特先生一块在雨中走回去。不过，克莱太太也不在乎这点雨，她简直就不认为天在下雨，再说，她的靴子又很厚，比安妮小姐的厚多了！总之，她的这番客套使她显得同安妮小姐一样迫切希望同埃利奥特先生一块走回去。两位女士有礼貌而又坚决地相互谦让，只好由别人来进行裁决了。埃利奥特小姐坚持认为克莱太太有点感冒，而埃利奥特先生受到请求，说他堂妹安妮的靴子更厚一些。","Her ladyship’s carriage was a barouche, and did not hold more than four with any comfort.Miss Carteret was with her mother; consequently it was not reasonable to expect accommodation for all the three Camden Place ladies.There could be no doubt as to Miss Elliot.Whoever suffered inconvenience, she must suffer none, but it occupied a little time to settle the point of civility between the other two.The rain was a mere trifle, and Anne was most sincere in preferring a walk with Mr. Elliot.But the rain was also a mere trifle to Mrs. Clay; she would hardly allow it even to drop at all, and her boots were so thick! much thicker than Miss Anne’s; and, in short, her civility rendered her quite as anxious to be left to walk with Mr. Elliot as Anne could be, and it was discussed between them with a generosity so polite and so determined, that the others were obliged to settle it for them; Miss Elliot maintaining that Mrs. Clay had a little cold already, and Mr. Elliot deciding on appeal, that his cousin Anne’s boots were rather the thickest."
"因此，大家决定让克莱太太上车。他们刚作出这样的决定，坐在窗口的安妮就清清楚楚地看到温特沃思上校正沿着大街走来。","It was fixed accordingly, that Mrs. Clay should be of the party in the carriage; and they had just reached this point, when Anne, as she sat near the window, descried, most decidedly and distinctly, Captain Wentworth walking down the street."
"她的惊讶只有她自己觉察到，但是她立即感觉到自己是这个世界上最大的傻瓜，最不可理解、最荒唐的人！一时之间，她眼前什么也看不见了，心中一片慌乱。她六神无主，等她责备了自己一通并回过神来时，她发现其他人正在等着上车，埃利奥特先生（总是那样殷勤）刚刚去联盟街为克莱太太办事了。","Her start was perceptible only to herself; but she instantly felt that she was the greatest simpleton in the world, the most unaccountable and absurd!For a few minutes she saw nothing before her; it was all confusion.She was lost, and when she had scolded back her senses, she found the others still waiting for the carriage, and Mr. Elliot (always obliging) just setting off for Union Street on a commission of Mrs. Clay’s."
"这时安妮非常想到门外去，看看是否还在下雨。她为什么要怀疑自己别有用心呢？温特沃思上校准是已经走得没踪影了。她离开了座位，想离开。她头脑中的一种想法不见得总比另一种想法更聪明，也不应该总是怀疑另一种想法比实际的更坏。他要看看天是否还在下雨。可是她马上就转回来了，因为温特沃思上校已经走进来了，他身边的一群绅士和淑女显然是他的熟人，他准是在米尔萨姆街上离这里不远的地方遇上的。他一见到安妮便显得十分震惊和困惑，安妮还从没见过他这种神态。他满脸通红。自从他们重新交往以后，安妮头一回感到自己没有他那么激动。她在最后几分钟里有了思想准备，便比他从容了一些。那种强烈惊讶产生的不可抗拒、令人眩晕和慌乱的最初效应已经消逝。不过，她仍然百感交集！是激动、痛苦、高兴，真是有点悲喜交加。","She now felt a great inclination to go to the outer door; she wanted to see if it rained.Why was she to suspect herself of another motive?Captain Wentworth must be out of sight.She left her seat, she would go; one half of her should not be always so much wiser than the other half, or always suspecting the other of being worse than it was.She would see if it rained.She was sent back, however, in a moment by the entrance of Captain Wentworth himself, among a party of gentlemen and ladies, evidently his acquaintance, and whom he must have joined a little below Milsom Street.He was more obviously struck and confused by the sight of her than she had ever observed before; he looked quite red.For the first time, since their renewed acquaintance, she felt that she was betraying the least sensibility of the two.She had the advantage of him in the preparation of the last few moments.All the overpowering, blinding, bewildering, first effects of strong surprise were over with her.Still, however, she had enough to feel!It was agitation, pain, pleasure, a something between delight and misery."
"温特沃思上校跟安妮说了几句话，便转过身去了。他显得很尴尬。她既不能说他冷漠或友好，也不能说他窘迫。","He spoke to her, and then turned away.The character of his manner was embarrassment.She could not have called it either cold or friendly, or anything so certainly as embarrassed."
"不过，过了一会儿，他又朝安妮走过来了，说了几句话。两人相互询问了共同感兴趣的问题，不过他们可能都没有听清楚对方说了些什么，安妮仍然觉得温特沃思上校没有以前那么洒脱了。以往他们常在一起，相互闲谈时表面上都很自然，也很平静，但是他现在却做不到了。时间改变了他，或者路易莎改变了他。温特沃思看上去有点不太好意思。他看上去很健康，不像经历过肉体或精神上的折磨。他谈起了阿珀克罗斯，谈起马斯格罗夫一家，甚至谈起了路易莎。在提到路易莎时，他脸上甚至掠过一副既俏皮又神气的表情。尽管如此，温特沃思上校仍然显得不太自然，有些拘束，无法装出泰然自若的样子。","After a short interval, however, he came towards her, and spoke again.Mutual enquiries on common subjects passed: neither of them, probably, much the wiser for what they heard, and Anne continuing fully sensible of his being less at ease than formerly.They had by dint of being so very much together, got to speak to each other with a considerable portion of apparent indifference and calmness; but he could not do it now.Time had changed him, or Louisa had changed him.There was consciousness of some sort or other.He looked very well, not as if he had been suffering in health or spirits, and he talked of Uppercross, of the Musgroves, nay, even of Louisa, and had even a momentary look of his own arch significance as he named her; but yet it was Captain Wentworth not comfortable, not easy, not able to feign that he was."
"安妮发现伊丽莎白不肯同温特沃思上校打招呼时并不感到吃惊，但是心里很难过。她知道温特沃思上校看见了伊丽莎白，而且伊丽莎白也看见了他，双方都完全认出了对方。她相信温特沃思上校以为伊丽莎白会把他当作熟人打招呼的，所以正等着呢。但是安妮痛苦地看到，她姐姐坚定而冷漠地将脸转过去了。","It did not surprise, but it grieved Anne to observe that Elizabeth would not know him.She saw that he saw Elizabeth, that Elizabeth saw him, that there was complete internal recognition on each side; she was convinced that he was ready to be acknowledged as an acquaintance, expecting it, and she had the pain of seeing her sister turn away with unalterable coldness."
"埃利奥特小姐正等得不耐烦的时候，达尔林普尔夫人的马车驶过来了。仆人过来通报。天又开始下雨了，总之，他们先是磨蹭了一下，忙了一阵，说了几句，这样一来，商店里的那些人都知道是达尔林普尔夫人的马车来送埃利奥特小姐回家。最后，埃利奥特小姐和她的朋友都走开了，只有仆人陪着她们上车（因为堂哥还没有回来），温特沃思上校望着他们，脸再次转向安妮，他虽然嘴上没说，但是举止上可以看出来，他愿意扶她上车。","Lady Dalrymple’s carriage, for which Miss Elliot was growing very impatient, now drew up; the servant came in to announce it.It was beginning to rain again, and altogether there was a delay, and a bustle, and a talking, which must make all the little crowd in the shop understand that Lady Dalrymple was calling to convey Miss Elliot.At last Miss Elliot and her friend, unattended but by the servant, (for there was no cousin returned), were walking off; and Captain Wentworth, watching them, turned again to Anne, and by manner, rather than words, was offering his services to her."
"“非常感谢你，”她回答说，“不过，我不和她们一起走。马车上坐不下这么多的人。我走回去，我喜欢走路。”","“I am much obliged to you,” was her answer, “but I am not going with them.The carriage would not accommodate so many.I walk: I prefer walking.”"
"“可是天在下雨。”","“But it rains.”"
"“哦！雨很小，我看这不算雨。”","“Oh! very little, Nothing that I regard.”"
"停了片刻后，他说：“虽然我昨天才到这里，我已经为在巴斯生活做好了准备，你看，”（指一下新伞）“如果你执意走路，我希望你能拿着这把伞。不过，我想我最好还是帮你雇一辆单座马车。”","After a moment’s pause he said: “Though I came only yesterday, I have equipped myself properly for Bath already, you see,” (pointing to a new umbrella); “I wish you would make use of it, if you are determined to walk; though I think it would be more prudent to let me get you a chair.”"
"安妮非常感激他，但还是谢绝了。她一再表示，眼下的雨算不了什么。又补充道：“我正在等埃利奥特先生。我想他一会儿就回来了。”","She was very much obliged to him, but declined it all, repeating her conviction, that the rain would come to nothing at present, and adding, “I am only waiting for Mr. Elliot.He will be here in a moment, I am sure.”"
"安妮刚说完，埃利奥特先生就走了进来。温特沃思上校完全记得他。他和那个站在莱姆台阶上用爱慕的眼光望着安妮走过的那个人毫无两样，只是在神态、表情和举止上表现出他拥有作为一个亲戚和朋友的特权。他匆匆忙忙地走进来，似乎看到的、想到的只是安妮，他为自己的耽搁表示歉意，对于让安妮久等感到内疚，只想在雨下大之前赶紧把安妮带走。转眼间，他们便一起离开了。安妮挽着他的胳膊，从温特沃思上校面前走过时，只是温情而又尴尬地匆匆望了他一眼，说了声“再见”。","She had hardly spoken the words when Mr. Elliot walked in.Captain Wentworth recollected him perfectly.There was no difference between him and the man who had stood on the steps at Lyme, admiring Anne as she passed, except in the air and look and manner of the privileged relation and friend.He came in with eagerness, appeared to see and think only of her, apologised for his stay, was grieved to have kept her waiting, and anxious to get her away without further loss of time and before the rain increased; and in another moment they walked off together, her arm under his, a gentle and embarrassed glance, and a “Good morning to you!” being all that she had time for, as she passed away."
"等他们的身影消失之后，与温特沃思上校同行的女士们就纷纷议论开了。","As soon as they were out of sight, the ladies of Captain Wentworth’s party began talking of them."
"“我想，埃利奥特先生并不讨厌他的堂妹吧？”","“Mr. Elliot does not dislike his cousin, I fancy?”"
"“啊！当然了，这是明摆着的。谁都会猜到将来会发生什么。他总是跟他们在一起，我想他有一半的时间是在她家里度过的。多么英俊的男子啊！”","“Oh! no, that is clear enough.One can guess what will happen there.He is always with them; half lives in the family, I believe.What a very good-looking man!”"
"“是啊，阿特金森小姐曾经同他一起在沃利斯家一起吃过饭，说他是她遇到过的最讨人喜欢的男子。”","“Yes, and Miss Atkinson, who dined with him once at the Wallises, says he is the most agreeable man she ever was in company with.”"
"“我觉得安妮•埃利奥特很漂亮。仔细看她的话，的确很漂亮。这么说似乎不大符合潮流，但是我承认，比起她姐姐，我更喜欢她。”","“She is pretty, I think; Anne Elliot; very pretty, when one comes to look at her.It is not the fashion to say so, but I confess I admire her more than her sister.”"
"“哦！我也是。”","“Oh! so do I.”"
"“我也是。她们两人之间是无法相比的。不过男人们都疯狂地追求埃利奥特小姐。安妮对他们来说太娇贵了。”","“And so do I. No comparison.But the men are all wild after Miss Elliot.Anne is too delicate for them.”"
"如果堂兄一声不吭地一直陪她走到卡姆登巷，安妮会对他感激不尽的。安妮从来没有觉得听他讲话这么困难，尽管他对安妮关怀备至、照顾周到，尽管他的话题基本上像往常一样，还是那么有趣：对拉塞尔夫人的赞美热情、公正而又有鉴赏力，对克莱太太的影射也十分在理。但是安妮这时一心只想着温特沃思上校。她无法想象他现在是种什么心情，他是否真正感到失望。不搞清楚这一点，她就无法平静下来。","Anne would have been particularly obliged to her cousin, if he would have walked by her side all the way to Camden Place, without saying a word.She had never found it so difficult to listen to him, though nothing could exceed his solicitude and care, and though his subjects were principally such as were wont to be always interesting: praise, warm, just, and discriminating, of Lady Russell, and insinuations highly rational against Mrs. Clay.But just now she could think only of Captain Wentworth.She could not understand his present feelings, whether he were really suffering much from disappointment or not; and till that point were settled, she could not be quite herself."
"她希望自己能很快变得明智和理智起来。但是天哪！天哪！她必须承认自己现在还不明智。","She hoped to be wise and reasonable in time; but alas!alas! she must confess to herself that she was not wise yet."
"还有个极其重要的情况需要她知道，那就是他要在巴斯呆多久。他没有说，或者是她自己想不起来了。不过，他更有可能要是来这里住上一阵子。如果是这样，鉴于在巴斯人人都可能相遇，拉塞尔夫人很有可能在某个地方遇见他。她还能想起他来吗？事情又会怎么样呢？","Another circumstance very essential for her to know, was how long he meant to be in Bath; he had not mentioned it, or she could not recollect it.He might be only passing through.But it was more probable that he should be come to stay.In that case, so liable as every body was to meet every body in Bath, Lady Russell would in all likelihood see him somewhere.Would she recollect him?How would it all be?"
"她已经不得不告诉拉塞尔夫人说，路易莎•马斯格罗夫要嫁给本威克舰长了。看到拉塞尔夫人吃惊的样子，安妮心里很不是滋味。现在拉塞尔夫人对事情还不是十分了解，要是再偶然遇见温特沃思上校，可能会加深她对温特沃思上校的偏见。","She had already been obliged to tell Lady Russell that Louisa Musgrove was to marry Captain Benwick.It had cost her something to encounter Lady Russell’s surprise; and now, if she were by any chance to be thrown into company with Captain Wentworth, her imperfect knowledge of the matter might add another shade of prejudice against him."
"第二天早晨，安妮同她的朋友一道出去，在头一个小时，安妮一直提心吊胆地留意温特沃思上校，却没有看见他。但是，最后在她们沿着普尔蒂尼街往回走的时候，她看见他走在右手边的人行道上，他所处的位置隔着半条街也能看得见。他周围有很多人，很多群人朝着同一个方向走，但是，没错，就是他。安妮下意识地看了拉塞尔夫人一眼。但这并非由于她傻乎乎地认为拉塞尔夫人会像她一样，一眼就会认出温特沃思上校。不，除非他们迎面走过，拉塞尔夫人才会认出他。不过安妮还是焦急不安，不时地瞅瞅拉塞尔夫人。等到能看清楚上校的时候，安妮虽说不敢再看拉塞尔夫人了（她知道自己的神情不宜让别人看见），但她十分清楚，拉塞尔夫人的目光完全转移到了上校身上——总之，她在目不转睛地注视着他。她完全可以理解，上校在拉塞尔夫人心中一定有一种魅力，使得她的目光很难从他身上移开。她一定会感到很惊讶，八九年的时光过去了，他一直在异国他乡服役，竟然丝毫没有丧失一点魅力！","The following morning Anne was out with her friend, and for the first hour, in an incessant and fearful sort of watch for him in vain; but at last, in returning down Pulteney Street, she distinguished him on the right hand pavement at such a distance as to have him in view the greater part of the street.There were many other men about him, many groups walking the same way, but there was no mistaking him.She looked instinctively at Lady Russell; but not from any mad idea of her recognising him so soon as she did herself.No, it was not to be supposed that Lady Russell would perceive him till they were nearly opposite.She looked at her however, from time to time, anxiously; and when the moment approached which must point him out, though not daring to look again (for her own countenance she knew was unfit to be seen), she was yet perfectly conscious of Lady Russell’s eyes being turned exactly in the direction for him—of her being, in short, intently observing him.She could thoroughly comprehend the sort of fascination he must possess over Lady Russell’s mind, the difficulty it must be for her to withdraw her eyes, the astonishment she must be feeling that eight or nine years should have passed over him, and in foreign climes and in active service too, without robbing him of one personal grace!"
"拉塞尔夫人终于把头转过来了。“现在她会怎么议论他呢？”","At last, Lady Russell drew back her head.“Now, how would she speak of him?”"
"“你大概很奇怪，”她说，“这么久我的眼睛一直在看什么吧。我在找艾丽西亚夫人和弗兰克兰太太昨晚告诉我的那些窗帘。她们说在这段街的这边有一家客厅的窗帘是巴斯最漂亮和挂得最得当的。不过她们记不清门牌号了，我一直在寻找，看是那一家。不过，我得承认我还没有看见她们所说的那种窗帘。”","“You will wonder,” said she, “what has been fixing my eye so long; but I was looking after some window-curtains, which Lady Alicia and Mrs. Frankland were telling me of last night.They described the drawing-room window-curtains of one of the houses on this side of the way, and this part of the street, as being the handsomest and best hung of any in Bath, but could not recollect the exact number, and I have been trying to find out which it could be; but I confess I can see no curtains hereabouts that answer their description.”"
"安妮叹了口气，脸上一红，带着怜悯和不屑的心情笑了一下，不知是笑她的朋友还是笑她自己。最使她感到愤怒的是，她浪费了那么多时间去揣摩和关注拉塞尔夫人的反应，竟然错过了观察温特沃思上校是否注意到了她们的时机。","Anne sighed and blushed and smiled, in pity and disdain, either at her friend or herself.The part which provoked her most, was that in all this waste of foresight and caution, she should have lost the right moment for seeing whether he saw them."
"一两天过去了，什么事情也没有发生。温特沃思上校很可能去剧院或参加晚会了，这对埃利奥特一家来说不是很时髦，他们晚上唯一的乐趣就是参加高雅而无聊的家庭宴会，而且他们参加这种宴会的次数越来越多。安妮厌倦了这种死气沉沉地生活，又因不知道外界情况而感到腻烦，觉得自己比以前更坚强了，因为自己的意志力没有经受过什么考验，急切地盼望着举行音乐会的那个晚上。这场音乐会是为达尔林普尔夫人资助的那个人举办的。当然，他们必须参加。这的确将是一次非常好的音乐会，而且温特沃思上校非常喜欢音乐。要是能够再跟他谈上几分钟，安妮就觉得自己心满意足了。至于说敢不敢跟他说话，安妮觉得只要有机会，她就有这个勇气。以前伊丽莎白没有理睬他，拉塞尔夫人对他视而不见，这些倒使安妮增强了勇气。她觉得自己应该关心一下他。","A day or two passed without producing anything.The theatre or the rooms, where he was most likely to be, were not fashionable enough for the Elliots, whose evening amusements were solely in the elegant stupidity of private parties, in which they were getting more and more engaged; and Anne, wearied of such a state of stagnation, sick of knowing nothing, and fancying herself stronger because her strength was not tried, was quite impatient for the concert evening.It was a concert for the benefit of a person patronised by Lady Dalrymple.Of course they must attend.It was really expected to be a good one, and Captain Wentworth was very fond of music.If she could only have a few minutes conversation with him again, she fancied she should be satisfied; and as to the power of addressing him, she felt all over courage if the opportunity occurred.Elizabeth had turned from him, Lady Russell overlooked him; her nerves were strengthened by these circumstances; she felt that she owed him attention."
"她曾经不很肯定地答应过史密斯夫人晚上要跟她在一块。不过，她匆匆去看了一下史密斯太太，说了声抱歉，今天不能久留了，答应明天一定再来多坐一会儿。史密斯太太非常和颜悦色地默许了。","She had once partly promised Mrs. Smith to spend the evening with her; but in a short hurried call she excused herself and put it off, with the more decided promise of a longer visit on the morrow.Mrs. Smith gave a most good-humoured acquiescence."
"“好极了，”她说，“不过你再来的时候一定要告诉我音乐会的详细情况。哪些人和你一块去？”","“By all means,” said she; “only tell me all about it, when you do come.Who is your party?”"
"安妮把所有人的名字说了一遍。史密斯太太没有说话，但是安妮起身离开的时候，她半认真、半开玩笑地说：“好吧，我衷心希望你们的音乐会成功。要是你明天能来，就一定得来。因为我有种预感，你可能不能总来看我了。”","Anne named them all.Mrs. Smith made no reply; but when she was leaving her said, and with an expression half serious, half arch, “Well, I heartily wish your concert may answer; and do not fail me to-morrow if you can come; for I begin to have a foreboding that I may not have many more visits from you.”"
"安妮吃了一惊，觉得有些莫名其妙。不过，她迟疑地站了一会儿，就不得不匆匆离开了，但是她心里并不感到遗憾。","Anne was startled and confused; but after standing in a moment’s suspense, was obliged, and not sorry to be obliged, to hurry away."
"第二十章","CHAPTER 20"
"沃尔特爵士、他的两个女儿以及克莱太太是那天晚上宴会上来得最早的。由于还得等候达尔林普尔夫人，他们就在八角厅的炉火旁坐了下来。不过，他们刚一坐定，门又打开了，温特沃思上校独自走了进来。安妮离他最近，却仍向前走了一步，立即打了声招呼。他本来准备好鞠个躬然后继续往前走的，但是安妮温柔地说了声“你好！”使得他没能径直地朝前走去，而是在安妮旁边站住回问起她的情况，尽管安妮那令人生畏的父亲和姐姐就在身后。对于安妮来说，他们都在背后是有利的，因为她看不见他们的脸色，而且也有勇气做她认为是正确的事情。","Sir Walter, his two daughters, and Mrs. Clay, were the earliest of all their party at the rooms in the evening; and as Lady Dalrymple must be waited for, they took their station by one of the fires in the Octagon Room.But hardly were they so settled, when the door opened again, and Captain Wentworth walked in alone.Anne was the nearest to him, and making yet a little advance, she instantly spoke.He was preparing only to bow and pass on, but her gentle “How do you do?” brought him out of the straight line to stand near her, and make enquiries in return, in spite of the formidable father and sister in the back ground.Their being in the back ground was a support to Anne; she knew nothing of their looks, and felt equal to everything which she believed right to be done."
"在他们说话的时候，安妮听见她父亲和伊丽莎白在窃窃私语。她听不清楚，但是她可以猜到他们说话的内容；温特沃思上校远远地鞠了个躬，安妮明白父亲经过思考已经打了个招呼，表示他们是认识的。她眼睛往旁边一瞥，正好看见伊丽莎白微微行了一个屈膝礼。这种表示虽然晚了些，而且态度勉强，也不太礼貌，但是总比毫无表示要强，安妮的心情也有所好转。","While they were speaking, a whispering between her father and Elizabeth caught her ear.She could not distinguish, but she must guess the subject; and on Captain Wentworth’s making a distant bow, she comprehended that her father had judged so well as to give him that simple acknowledgement of acquaintance, and she was just in time by a side glance to see a slight curtsey from Elizabeth herself.This, though late, and reluctant, and ungracious, was yet better than nothing, and her spirits improved."
"然而，两人在谈了天气、巴斯和音乐会之后，接下来他们的话渐渐减少了，最后几乎无话可说了。安妮以为他随时都会走开，但是他没有。他看起来似乎并不急于离开她。过了一会儿，他又恢复了兴致，微笑着，脸上露出了淡淡的红晕，他说：","After talking, however, of the weather, and Bath, and the concert, their conversation began to flag, and so little was said at last, that she was expecting him to go every moment, but he did not; he seemed in no hurry to leave her; and presently with renewed spirit, with a little smile, a little glow, he said—"
"“自从我们在莱姆的那天以后，我几乎没怎么见过你。我恐怕你那次一定是受惊了，虽然你当时没有吓晕过去，但是一定受惊得很厉害吧。”","“I have hardly seen you since our day at Lyme.I am afraid you must have suffered from the shock, and the more from its not overpowering you at the time.”"
"她向他保证说她没有受惊。","She assured him that she had not."
"“那是个可怕的时刻，”他说，“可怕的一天！”他用手揉了一下眼睛，仿佛回忆起这件事情来仍然非常痛苦，但是一会儿他又微微一笑，接着说道：“不过，那天的事情还是产生了一定的影响，应该说是绝非可怕的影响。当时你镇定自若地建议最好让本威克舰长去请外科医生时，你肯定想不到他会最终成为最关心路易莎恢复的人吧。”","“It was a frightful hour,” said he, “a frightful day!” and he passed his hand across his eyes, as if the remembrance were still too painful, but in a moment, half smiling again, added, “The day has produced some effects however; has had some consequences which must be considered as the very reverse of frightful.When you had the presence of mind to suggest that Benwick would be the properest person to fetch a surgeon, you could have little idea of his being eventually one of those most concerned in her recovery.”"
"“我当然不可能想到。但是看起来——我倒是希望它会是一桩比较美满的婚姻。他们双方都有好的操守和好的性情。”","“Certainly I could have none.But it appears—I should hope it would be a very happy match.There are on both sides good principles and good temper.”"
"“对啊，”他说，看样子并不十分爽快，“不过，我想他们的相似之处也就只有这些了。我全心全意地祝他们幸福，并为促进他们幸福的一切感到高兴。他们在家里没有遇到什么困难，没有反对，没有出尔反尔，也没有拖延。马斯格罗夫夫妇还是和往常一样，非常正直而友善，只是出于父母的真心，希望促进女儿的幸福。这一切都对他们的幸福有利，而且非常有利，或许比——”","“Yes,” said he, looking not exactly forward; “but there, I think, ends the resemblance.With all my soul I wish them happy, and rejoice over every circumstance in favour of it.They have no difficulties to contend with at home, no opposition, no caprice, no delays.The Musgroves are behaving like themselves, most honourably and kindly, only anxious with true parental hearts to promote their daughter’s comfort.All this is much, very much in favour of their happiness; more than perhaps—”"
"他打住了。他似乎想起了什么，只见安妮满脸通红，眼睛盯着地面，他仿佛感受到了这种强烈感情。不过，他清了清嗓子，接着说道：","He stopped.A sudden recollection seemed to occur, and to give him some taste of that emotion which was reddening Anne’s cheeks and fixing her eyes on the ground.After clearing his throat, however, he proceeded thus—"
"“我承认他们彼此间有差距，而且差距很大，从某种层次上来说，不亚于心灵上的差距。我认为路易莎•马斯格罗夫是一位非常和善、十分温和的姑娘，并不缺乏理解力，但是本威克更胜一筹。他是个聪明人，博览群书。我承认，我觉得他爱上路易莎确实让我有点吃惊。假如是出于感激之情，假如是他以为路易莎看上了自己才使他爱上她，那就另当别论了。但是，我觉得没有理由这么认为。相反，他的感情看起来是完全出于本能，完全自发的，这使我感到惊讶。像他这样一个人，又处在那种情况！他的心受过刺激，受过创伤，几乎都碎了！范妮•哈维尔是一位杰出的女子，他对范妮的感情是真心实意的。一个男人是无法从对这么一个女子如此真挚的感情中恢复过来的。他不应该，他也做不到。”","“I confess that I do think there is a disparity, too great a disparity, and in a point no less essential than mind.I regard Louisa Musgrove as a very amiable, sweet-tempered girl, and not deficient in understanding, but Benwick is something more.He is a clever man, a reading man; and I confess, that I do consider his attaching himself to her with some surprise.Had it been the effect of gratitude, had he learnt to love her, because he believed her to be preferring him, it would have been another thing.But I have no reason to suppose it so.It seems, on the contrary, to have been a perfectly spontaneous, untaught feeling on his side, and this surprises me.A man like him, in his situation! with a heart pierced, wounded, almost broken!Fanny Harville was a very superior creature, and his attachment to her was indeed attachment.A man does not recover from such a devotion of the heart to such a woman.He ought not; he does not.”"
"这时，他或许是想到他的朋友已经恢复过来了，或许是想到了其他事情，反正他没有再说下去。尽管他说到后来声音很激动，尽管满屋人声嘈杂，而且还有人不断碰门和走路的窸窣声，安妮仍然听清楚了每一个字。她感到惊讶、感激、迷惑，呼吸变得急促起来，只觉得百感交集。要她讨论这个话题是不可能的。然而，她在停了一会儿之后，觉得有必要说几句，但又根本不想转变话题，只是使内容稍微偏离了一点而已：","Either from the consciousness, however, that his friend had recovered, or from other consciousness, he went no farther; and Anne who, in spite of the agitated voice in which the latter part had been uttered, and in spite of all the various noises of the room, the almost ceaseless slam of the door, and ceaseless buzz of persons walking through, had distinguished every word, was struck, gratified, confused, and beginning to breathe very quick, and feel an hundred things in a moment.It was impossible for her to enter on such a subject; and yet, after a pause, feeling the necessity of speaking, and having not the smallest wish for a total change, she only deviated so far as to say—"
"“我想，你在莱姆呆了不少日子吧？”","“You were a good while at Lyme, I think?”"
"“两个星期左右。我一直等到路易莎确定脱离了危险才离开。对这次不幸事件我深感内疚，无法很快平静下来。这都是我造成的，全都是我造成的。如果我不是那么软弱，她就不会那么固执。莱姆周围的风景非常好。我在那儿常常散步和骑马。我见到的越多，发现值得欣赏的风景点也越多。”","“About a fortnight.I could not leave it till Louisa’s doing well was quite ascertained.I had been too deeply concerned in the mischief to be soon at peace.It had been my doing, solely mine.She would not have been obstinate if I had not been weak.The country round Lyme is very fine.I walked and rode a great deal; and the more I saw, the more I found to admire.”"
"“我真想再去莱姆看看。”安妮说。","“I should very much like to see Lyme again,” said Anne."
"“真的吗？我真没想到你会在莱姆发现了激起你这种感情的东西。你卷入了这么恐怖和痛苦的事情，一定感到思想紧张、精神疲惫！我本以为莱姆给你留下的最后印象一定是深恶痛绝的。”","“Indeed!I should not have supposed that you could have found anything in Lyme to inspire such a feeling.The horror and distress you were involved in, the stretch of mind, the wear of spirits!I should have thought your last impressions of Lyme must have been strong disgust.”"
"“最后几个小时当然是非常痛苦的，”安妮回答道，“不过，痛苦过去以后再回想回想，却又常常感到很愉快。一个人不会因为在某个地方有过痛苦的经历而减少对那里的热爱，除非那里只有痛苦，除了痛苦之外一无所有，而莱姆决非是这种情况。我们只是在最后两个小时内感到焦虑和不安，在这之前大家有过很多欢乐的时刻。那里有那么多新奇而美好的事物！我很少旅行，因此每到一个新鲜的地方，对我来说都很有趣，不过莱姆确实很美。总之，”（她似乎回忆起了什么事情，脸上泛起了淡淡的红晕），“总的来说，我对这个地方的印象还是很不错的。”","“The last hours were certainly very painful,” replied Anne; “but when pain is over, the remembrance of it often becomes a pleasure.One does not love a place the less for having suffered in it, unless it has been all suffering, nothing but suffering, which was by no means the case at Lyme.We were only in anxiety and distress during the last two hours, and previously there had been a great deal of enjoyment.So much novelty and beauty!I have travelled so little, that every fresh place would be interesting to me; but there is real beauty at Lyme; and in short” (with a faint blush at some recollections), “altogether my impressions of the place are very agreeable.”"
"她话音刚落，入口的大门又打开了，出现的正是大家期待的那些人。人们高兴地喊了起来：“达尔林普尔夫人，达尔林普尔夫人。”沃尔特爵士和他家的两位女士非常热切而彬彬有礼地迎上前去。达尔林普尔夫人和卡特雷特小姐在埃利奥特先生和沃利斯上校的陪同下走进屋里——他们与夫人几乎同时到达。其他人都迎了上去，安妮觉得自己也必须迎上前去。她同温特沃思上校分开了。他们之间有趣的、引人入胜的谈话不得不暂时中断，但是这种苦恼同带来这一苦恼的欢乐比起来，是微不足道的！就在刚才的十分钟里，安妮进一步了解了他对路易莎的感情，也明白了他的各种心思，这些事情是她以前所不敢想的。因此她就听从人们的要求，以一种非常微妙而又颇为激动的心情，去适应当时应酬的需要。她对所有人都很友好。刚才了解到的一切促使她非常有礼貌、非常友善地对待每一个人，并怜悯所有的人，因为他们不像她那么幸福。","As she ceased, the entrance door opened again, and the very party appeared for whom they were waiting.“Lady Dalrymple, Lady Dalrymple,” was the rejoicing sound; and with all the eagerness compatible with anxious elegance, Sir Walter and his two ladies stepped forward to meet her.Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret, escorted by Mr. Elliot and Colonel Wallis, who had happened to arrive nearly at the same instant, advanced into the room.The others joined them, and it was a group in which Anne found herself also necessarily included.She was divided from Captain Wentworth.Their interesting, almost too interesting conversation must be broken up for a time, but slight was the penance compared with the happiness which brought it on!She had learnt, in the last ten minutes, more of his feelings towards Louisa, more of all his feelings than she dared to think of; and she gave herself up to the demands of the party, to the needful civilities of the moment, with exquisite, though agitated sensations.She was in good humour with all.She had received ideas which disposed her to be courteous and kind to all, and to pity every one, as being less happy than herself."
"当安妮离开那些人，打算再同温特沃思上校交谈时，发现他已经走开了，兴奋的心情变略有减退。她正好看见他走进音乐厅。他走了，不见了，安妮一时感到有些遗憾。不过“我们还会再见面的。他会来找我的，在晚会结束前他会来找我的。现在，两人分开一会儿也许更好些。我需要点时间回想一下。”","The delightful emotions were a little subdued, when on stepping back from the group, to be joined again by Captain Wentworth, she saw that he was gone.She was just in time to see him turn into the Concert Room.He was gone; he had disappeared, she felt a moment’s regret.But “they should meet again.He would look for her, he would find her out before the evening were over, and at present, perhaps, it was as well to be asunder.She was in need of a little interval for recollection.”"
"不一会儿，拉塞尔夫人也来了，大家都到齐了，只等着依次进入音乐厅了。大家摆足架子，尽可能吸引别人的注目、窃窃私语和心神不宁。","Upon Lady Russell’s appearance soon afterwards, the whole party was collected, and all that remained was to marshal themselves, and proceed into the Concert Room; and be of all the consequence in their power, draw as many eyes, excite as many whispers, and disturb as many people as they could."
"伊丽莎白和安妮•埃利奥特进入音乐厅时都感到无比幸福。伊丽莎白挽着卡特雷特小姐的手臂，望着前面达尔林普尔子爵遗孀的宽阔的背部，似乎自己没有什么奢望是不可企及的。而安妮——不过，要将她的幸福性质同她的姐姐相比，那对她来说是一种侮辱。一方面是出于自私的虚荣，另一方面是出于丰富的感情。","Very, very happy were both Elizabeth and Anne Elliot as they walked in.Elizabeth arm in arm with Miss Carteret, and looking on the broad back of the dowager Viscountess Dalrymple before her, had nothing to wish for which did not seem within her reach; and Anne—but it would be an insult to the nature of Anne’s felicity, to draw any comparison between it and her sister’s; the origin of one all selfish vanity, of the other all generous attachment."
"安妮没有看到，也没有想到这间屋子的金碧辉煌。她的快乐是发自内心的。她的眼睛亮晶晶的、两颊发红，但她对此却毫无察觉。她脑子里只想着刚才的那半个小时，当他们朝座位走去时，安妮匆匆回想了一下当时的一幕。温特沃思上校选择的话题，他的谈吐，特别是他的举止和表情，使她只能产生一种看法。他似乎急切地要把他对路易莎弱点的看法告诉安妮，他对本威克舰长的惊讶，他对炽热初恋的感受，他说出口却没有说完的话语，他稍稍移开的眼睛以及那意味深长的目光，这一切的一切都表明他至少对安妮回心转意了。他的愤怒、怨恨和回避已经不复存在了。取而代之的不止是友谊与关切，还有往日的柔情。是的，还有几分往日的柔情。她不能不认为这种变化是意味深长的。他一定还爱着她。","Anne saw nothing, thought nothing of the brilliancy of the room.Her happiness was from within.Her eyes were bright and her cheeks glowed; but she knew nothing about it.She was thinking only of the last half hour, and as they passed to their seats, her mind took a hasty range over it.His choice of subjects, his expressions, and still more his manner and look, had been such as she could see in only one light.His opinion of Louisa Musgrove’s inferiority, an opinion which he had seemed solicitous to give, his wonder at Captain Benwick, his feelings as to a first, strong attachment; sentences begun which he could not finish, his half averted eyes and more than half expressive glance, all, all declared that he had a heart returning to her at least; that anger, resentment, avoidance, were no more; and that they were succeeded, not merely by friendship and regard, but by the tenderness of the past.Yes, some share of the tenderness of the past.She could not contemplate the change as implying less.He must love her."
"她一心想着这些念头，脑海中浮现的是当时的种种情景，搅得她心慌意乱，使她没有能力去留心周围的事情。她在大厅走过时没有瞥见他，甚至并不想仔细地找他。等大家坐定，安排妥当以后，她环顾四周看他是否恰巧坐在附近，但是他不在，安妮没有看见他。这时，音乐会正好开始，她只得满足于暂时抑制一下内心的幸福。","These were thoughts, with their attendant visions, which occupied and flurried her too much to leave her any power of observation; and she passed along the room without having a glimpse of him, without even trying to discern him.When their places were determined on, and they were all properly arranged, she looked round to see if he should happen to be in the same part of the room, but he was not; her eye could not reach him; and the concert being just opening, she must consent for a time to be happy in a humbler way."
"他们这一群人分别坐在两张相邻的长凳上，安妮坐在前排，埃利奥特先生在他的朋友沃利斯上校的安排下，十分巧妙地坐到了安妮的旁边。埃利奥特小姐感到非常满意，因为坐在她周围的都是她的表亲，而且她是沃利斯上校献殷勤的主要对象。","The party was divided and disposed of on two contiguous benches: Anne was among those on the foremost, and Mr. Elliot had manoeuvred so well, with the assistance of his friend Colonel Wallis, as to have a seat by her.Miss Elliot, surrounded by her cousins, and the principal object of Colonel Wallis’s gallantry, was quite contented."
"安妮以十分愉快的心情对待这天晚上的节目，这是一种恰到好处的消遣：她能体会音乐的柔情，喜欢欢快的曲调，能领略精确的演奏技巧，对那些令人厌烦的部分也能忍受。她从来没有这么喜欢过一场音乐会，至少在上半场是如此。在上半场快结束时，趁着唱完一首意大利歌曲的间隙，她给埃利奥特先生解释歌词的内容。他们两人共看一份曲目单。","Anne’s mind was in a most favourable state for the entertainment of the evening; it was just occupation enough: she had feelings for the tender, spirits for the gay, attention for the scientific, and patience for the wearisome; and had never liked a concert better, at least during the first act.Towards the close of it, in the interval succeeding an Italian song, she explained the words of the song to Mr. Elliot.They had a concert bill between them."
"她说：“这就是歌词的大意，或者更确切地说，这就是歌词的意思，因为意大利爱情歌曲的含义当然是无法言传的，不过这就是我所能说明白的歌词的意思。因为我不想对这个语言不懂装懂。我的意大利语学得很差。”","“This,” said she, “is nearly the sense, or rather the meaning of the words, for certainly the sense of an Italian love-song must not be talked of, but it is as nearly the meaning as I can give; for I do not pretend to understand the language.I am a very poor Italian scholar.”"
"“是的，是的，我知道你学得很差。我知道你对此什么都不懂。你只有那么一点语言知识，只不过一看到这些倒装、变位、缩略的意大利语就可以译成清晰、易懂、优美的英语。你再也不用说你才疏学浅了。这就是充足的证据。”","“Yes, yes, I see you are.I see you know nothing of the matter.You have only knowledge enough of the language to translate at sight these inverted, transposed, curtailed Italian lines, into clear, comprehensible, elegant English.You need not say anything more of your ignorance.Here is complete proof.”"
"“我不会对你这样客气的夸奖提出异议。不过，要是一个真正的专家来考我，那就糟了。”","“I will not oppose such kind politeness; but I should be sorry to be examined by a real proficient.”"
"“我要不是成为了卡姆登巷的常客，就不会对安妮•埃利奥特小姐有所了解。我确实认为她过于谦虚，使人们对她的才智不甚了解，而她拥有高度修养，要是在另一位女士身上，这种谦虚就会不自然了。”","“I have not had the pleasure of visiting in Camden Place so long,” replied he, “without knowing something of Miss Anne Elliot; and I do regard her as one who is too modest for the world in general to be aware of half her accomplishments, and too highly accomplished for modesty to be natural in any other woman.”"
"“真不敢当！真不敢当！你这么说可就过奖了。我忘了，下一个曲目是什么。”说着便看起曲目单。","“For shame! for shame! this is too much flattery.I forget what we are to have next,” turning to the bill."
"“也许，”埃利奥特先生低声说，“你还不知道，我在认识你以前就了解你的性格了。”","“Perhaps,” said Mr. Elliot, speaking low, “I have had a longer acquaintance with your character than you are aware of.”"
"“真的！怎么会？我到巴斯来以后你才认识我，除非你以前在我家里听他们谈论起我。”","“Indeed!How so?You can have been acquainted with it only since I came to Bath, excepting as you might hear me previously spoken of in my own family.”"
"“早在你来巴斯以前我就听说过你了。我听到过非常了解你的人谈起过你。我已经了解你的性格好多年了。你的人品，你的性情，你的修养。你的举止——都有人向我谈起过。”","“I knew you by report long before you came to Bath.I had heard you described by those who knew you intimately.I have been acquainted with you by character many years.Your person, your disposition, accomplishments, manner; they were all present to me.”"
"埃利奥特先生果然如愿以偿，激起了他希望激起的安妮的兴趣。没有人能够抵挡住这种神秘的魅力。某人在很早以前就在这位新朋友面前谈起过她，这是难以抵制的好奇。安妮非常好奇。她很吃惊，急切地询问他，但是毫无结果。他很乐意被安妮询问，但是就是不肯说。","Mr. Elliot was not disappointed in the interest he hoped to raise.No one can withstand the charm of such a mystery.To have been described long ago to a recent acquaintance, by nameless people, is irresistible; and Anne was all curiosity.She wondered, and questioned him eagerly; but in vain.He delighted in being asked, but he would not tell."
"“不，不，也许以后某个时间，但是现在不行。现在我不愿意说出人家的名字。不过我向你保证，这是真的。很多年前，我就听人谈起过安妮•埃利奥特小姐，这就使我非常敬重你的美德，并激发了想与你结识的强烈的好奇心。”","“No, no, some time or other, perhaps, but not now.He would mention no names now; but such, he could assure her, had been the fact.He had many years ago received such a description of Miss Anne Elliot as had inspired him with the highest idea of her merit, and excited the warmest curiosity to know her.”"
"安妮觉得只有温特沃思上校的哥哥，就是住在蒙克福德的温特沃思先生，才会在很多年以前这么夸赞过她。他也许见过埃利奥特先生，但是安妮没有这个勇气去问。","Anne could think of no one so likely to have spoken with partiality of her many years ago as the Mr. Wentworth of Monkford, Captain Wentworth’s brother.He might have been in Mr. Elliot’s company, but she had not courage to ask the question."
"“安妮•埃利奥特这个名字，”他说，“早就对我具有有趣的吸引力。它早就对我产生了魅力。如果我有胆量，我愿意说出我的心愿，我希望这个名字永远不要改变。“","“The name of Anne Elliot,” said he, “has long had an interesting sound to me.Very long has it possessed a charm over my fancy; and, if I dared, I would breathe my wishes that the name might never change.”"
"安妮觉得他是这么说的。但是她刚一听到话音，她的注意力就被她身后的其他人的谈话吸引住了，这个谈话使得其他的一切事情都变得无足轻重了。她的父亲和达尔林普尔夫人正在说话。","Such, she believed, were his words; but scarcely had she received their sound, than her attention was caught by other sounds immediately behind her, which rendered every thing else trivial.Her father and Lady Dalrymple were speaking."
"“一个英俊的男人，”沃尔特爵士说道，“一个非常英俊的男人。”","“A well-looking man,” said Sir Walter, “a very well-looking man.”"
"”确实是非常潇洒的男人！“达尔林普尔夫人说道。“风度比在巴斯常见的那些人出众得多。我想，他是爱尔兰人吧。”","“A very fine young man indeed!” said Lady Dalrymple.“More air than one often sees in Bath.Irish, I dare say.”"
"“不，我只知道他的名字。他是位点头之交。他姓温特沃思，温特沃思海军上校。他姐夫是我在萨默塞特郡的房客——克罗夫特，租下了凯林奇。”","“No, I just know his name.A bowing acquaintance.Wentworth; Captain Wentworth of the navy.His sister married my tenant in Somersetshire, the Croft, who rents Kellynch.”"
"沃尔特爵士话刚说到这里，安妮的目光看到了正确的方向，发现温特沃思上校正站在不远处的一群人当中。当安妮的目光落到他身上时，他的目光似乎正从安妮身上移开。看上去是这样的。安妮似乎晚了一步。她大胆地注视了那么久，而他却没有再看她一眼。演出又开始了，安妮不得不将她的注意力转向乐队，往前看去。","Before Sir Walter had reached this point, Anne’s eyes had caught the right direction, and distinguished Captain Wentworth standing among a cluster of men at a little distance.As her eyes fell on him, his seemed to be withdrawn from her.It had that appearance.It seemed as if she had been one moment too late; and as long as she dared observe, he did not look again: but the performance was recommencing, and she was forced to seem to restore her attention to the orchestra and look straight forward."
"等到她再次转眼看去时，他已经走开了。他即使想走到安妮身边，他也难以办到。她被这么多人团团围住，但她更想看到他的眼睛。","When she could give another glance, he had moved away.He could not have come nearer to her if he would; she was so surrounded and shut in: but she would rather have caught his eye."
"埃利奥特先生的那番话使她感到苦恼。她不想同他再谈下去。她希望他坐得不要离她这么近。","Mr. Elliot’s speech, too, distressed her.She had no longer any inclination to talk to him.She wished him not so near her."
"音乐会的上半场结束了。安妮希望现在能出现一些有利的变化。大家闲聊了一会儿，有些人想要去喝杯茶。安妮是其中为数不多的不想离开的人。她留在自己的座位上，拉塞尔夫人也没有离开。不过她很高兴摆脱了埃利奥特先生。她觉得不管拉塞尔夫人怎么想，要是温特沃思上校给她机会的话，她是不会不敢同温特沃思上校交谈的。她从拉塞尔夫人的表情上可以看出，她已经看到温特沃思上校了。","The first act was over.Now she hoped for some beneficial change; and, after a period of nothing-saying amongst the party, some of them did decide on going in quest of tea.Anne was one of the few who did not choose to move.She remained in her seat, and so did Lady Russell; but she had the pleasure of getting rid of Mr. Elliot; and she did not mean, whatever she might feel on Lady Russell’s account, to shrink from conversation with Captain Wentworth, if he gave her the opportunity.She was persuaded by Lady Russell’s countenance that she had seen him."
"不过，温特沃思上校没有走过来。安妮有时以为她看见他在远处，可是他从没有过来。令人焦虑不安的休息时间白白过去了。其他人回来了，房间里又挤满了人，大家重新坐回凳子上，一个小时的愉快或者苦恼又将开始，另一个小时的音乐使人高兴或打哈欠，这就要看对音乐的欣赏是真还是假了。对于安妮来说，这大概是焦虑不安的一个小时。要是不再看上一眼温特沃思，要是不能再同他交换一个友好的眼神，安妮是无法平静地走出这个音乐厅的。","He did not come however.Anne sometimes fancied she discerned him at a distance, but he never came.The anxious interval wore away unproductively.The others returned, the room filled again, benches were reclaimed and repossessed, and another hour of pleasure or of penance was to be sat out, another hour of music was to give delight or the gapes, as real or affected taste for it prevailed.To Anne, it chiefly wore the prospect of an hour of agitation.She could not quit that room in peace without seeing Captain Wentworth once more, without the interchange of one friendly look."
"大家重新入座的时候，发生了很多变化，而这些变化对安妮来说是有利的。沃利斯上校不肯再坐下来，埃利奥特小姐和卡特雷特小姐以不容推辞的口吻邀请埃利奥特先生坐在她们中间。由于其他人也动了动，安妮自己也使了一点小小的计谋，于是她能够坐到比以前离长凳末端更近的地方，这样更容易接近过往的人。她这样做时，难免又要把自己同无法模仿的拉罗尔斯小姐相比。可是安妮还是这样做了，而且没有什么更令人高兴的结果。不过由于坐在她周围的人不断地早早离开，在音乐会结束之前，安妮发现自己就坐在长凳的末端。","In re-settling themselves there were now many changes, the result of which was favourable for her.Colonel Wallis declined sitting down again, and Mr. Elliot was invited by Elizabeth and Miss Carteret, in a manner not to be refused, to sit between them; and by some other removals, and a little scheming of her own, Anne was enabled to place herself much nearer the end of the bench than she had been before, much more within reach of a passer-by.She could not do so, without comparing herself with Miss Larolles, the inimitable Miss Larolles; but still she did it, and not with much happier effect; though by what seemed prosperity in the shape of an early abdication in her next neighbours, she found herself at the very end of the bench before the concert closed."
"再次见到温特沃思上校时，安妮就坐在这个位置，旁边还有一个空位。她看见温特沃思上校就在附近。他也看见了她。但是神情严肃，似乎有点迟疑，慢腾腾地走到可以同她说话的地方。她觉得一定是出了什么事情。变化是不容置疑的。他这时的神情同在八角厅时的截然不同。这是怎么回事？她想到了她父亲，想到了拉塞尔夫人。难道他们的眼色令人不快？他先是严肃地谈起了音乐会，就像在阿珀克罗斯的温特沃思上校一样。他承认自己有些失望，他原本期望能听到更好的歌声。总之，他承认演出结束时，他才不会感到遗憾。安妮回答时，倒为演唱会辩护了一番，不过为了照顾到他的情绪，说得非常委婉巧妙，他的脸色缓和了下来，答话时也有了笑容。他们又谈了几分钟，气氛逐渐好转。他甚至朝长凳上望去，仿佛发现了一个值得一坐的好位子。就在这时，有人碰了碰安妮的肩膀，这使得她不得不转过身去。原来是埃利奥特先生。他向安妮表示抱歉，但不得不请安妮再解释一下意大利语。卡特雷特小姐非常急切地想了解下一个演奏曲目的大致意思。安妮无法拒绝。但是从来没有这么难受地为礼貌作出牺牲。","Such was her situation, with a vacant space at hand, when Captain Wentworth was again in sight.She saw him not far off.He saw her too; yet he looked grave, and seemed irresolute, and only by very slow degrees came at last near enough to speak to her.She felt that something must be the matter.The change was indubitable.The difference between his present air and what it had been in the Octagon Room was strikingly great.Why was it?She thought of her father, of Lady Russell.Could there have been any unpleasant glances?He began by speaking of the concert gravely, more like the Captain Wentworth of Uppercross; owned himself disappointed, had expected singing; and in short, must confess that he should not be sorry when it was over.Anne replied, and spoke in defence of the performance so well, and yet in allowance for his feelings so pleasantly, that his countenance improved, and he replied again with almost a smile.They talked for a few minutes more; the improvement held; he even looked down towards the bench, as if he saw a place on it well worth occupying; when at that moment a touch on her shoulder obliged Anne to turn round.It came from Mr. Elliot.He begged her pardon, but she must be applied to, to explain Italian again.Miss Carteret was very anxious to have a general idea of what was next to be sung.Anne could not refuse; but never had she sacrificed to politeness with a more suffering spirit."
"安妮虽尽可能地简短，但是还是不可避免地花去了好几分钟。等她脱出身来，能够像先前那样转身看时，她发现上校正走上前来，拘谨而匆匆地向她告别。“我得向你说晚安了。我要走了，我得尽快回家。”","A few minutes, though as few as possible, were inevitably consumed; and when her own mistress again, when able to turn and look as she had done before, she found herself accosted by Captain Wentworth, in a reserved yet hurried sort of farewell.“He must wish her good night; he was going; he should get home as fast as he could.”"
"“难道这首歌不值得你留下来听一听吗？”安妮说道，她突然想到了什么，所以更加急切地鼓励他留下。","“Is not this song worth staying for?” said Anne, suddenly struck by an idea which made her yet more anxious to be encouraging."
"“不！”他令人吃惊地回答道，“这里没有什么值得我留下来的，”说完，马上走了出去。","“No!” he replied impressively, “there is nothing worth my staying for;” and he was gone directly."
"嫉妒埃利奥特先生！显而易见，这是唯一的理由。温特沃思上校对她的感情产生了嫉妒！就在一周以前，甚至三个小时以前她都不能相信！一时之间，她非常高兴。可是，天哪！她脑海中接着又出现了很多不同的念头。如何才能消除这种嫉妒呢？怎样让他知道事情的真相呢？他们各自的处境都特别不利，怎样才能让他了解自己的真实感情呢？安妮一想起埃利奥特先生的殷勤就苦恼。这番殷勤带来的祸害真是不可估量。","Jealousy of Mr. Elliot!It was the only intelligible motive.Captain Wentworth jealous of her affection!Could she have believed it a week ago; three hours ago!For a moment the gratification was exquisite.But, alas!there were very different thoughts to succeed.How was such jealousy to be quieted?How was the truth to reach him?How, in all the peculiar disadvantages of their respective situations, would he ever learn of her real sentiments?It was misery to think of Mr. Elliot’s attentions.Their evil was incalculable."
"第二十一章","CHAPTER 21"
"安妮高兴地想起她曾答应第二天早晨要去看望史密斯太太，这就意味着她可以在埃利奥特先生最可能来访的时候出门了，因为避开埃利奥特先生几乎成了她现在的首要目标。","Anne recollected with pleasure the next morning her promise of going to Mrs. Smith, meaning that it should engage her from home at the time when Mr. Elliot would be most likely to call; for to avoid Mr. Elliot was almost a first object."
"她对埃利奥特先生还是很有好感的。尽管他的殷勤带来了麻烦，但是她还是感激他、尊重他，或许是同情他。她不由得想起他们见面时不同寻常的情况，想到从他本人的感情，从他对她的一见钟情，从种种情况看来，他似乎有理由赢得安妮的好感。总之，这件事非常不同寻常，既让人欢喜又让人痛苦。这太叫人遗憾了。要是这件事情中没有温特沃思上校，她会怎么想，这个问题不值得探究，因为事实上有温特沃思上校。不管眼下悬而未决的结局是好是坏，安妮永远钟情于温特沃思上校。她觉得他们的结合同他们彻底分手相比，不见得会使她与其他的男人更为疏远。","She felt a great deal of good-will towards him.In spite of the mischief of his attentions, she owed him gratitude and regard, perhaps compassion.She could not help thinking much of the extraordinary circumstances attending their acquaintance, of the right which he seemed to have to interest her, by everything in situation, by his own sentiments, by his early prepossession.It was altogether very extraordinary; flattering, but painful.There was much to regret.How she might have felt had there been no Captain Wentworth in the case, was not worth enquiry; for there was a Captain Wentworth; and be the conclusion of the present suspense good or bad, her affection would be his for ever.Their union, she believed, could not divide her more from other men, than their final separation."
"从卡姆登巷到西门大楼的路上，安妮浮想联翩，心中充满着对崇高爱情和永恒忠贞的沉思，巴斯的街道上是不可能有过比这样更美好的情思。这几乎在一路上洒下了净化和芬芳。","Prettier musings of high-wrought love and eternal constancy, could never have passed along the streets of Bath, than Anne was sporting with from Camden Place to Westgate Buildings.It was almost enough to spread purification and perfume all the way."
"她知道自己肯定会受到友善的接待。她的朋友今天早晨看起来似乎特别感激她的到来，虽说她们事先约好了，但是她似乎没想到安妮会来。","She was sure of a pleasant reception; and her friend seemed this morning particularly obliged to her for coming, seemed hardly to have expected her, though it had been an appointment."
"史密斯太太马上要安妮谈谈音乐会的情况。安妮对音乐会的回忆相当愉快，这使得她谈起来富有表情、兴致勃勃。凡是能说的，安妮都高兴地告诉了史密斯太太，但是对于一个曾经到过那里的人，这还远远不够，也不能使史密斯太太这样一个好打听的人感到满意，因为对于晚会的全面成功和效果，她已经从一位洗衣女工和招待那里听到了比安妮说的更为详细的情况。她现在问的是与会者的某些具体情况，可是却得不到满意的回答。史密斯太太对巴斯的每一位不管是举足轻重还是声名狼藉的人都很熟悉。","An account of the concert was immediately claimed; and Anne’s recollections of the concert were quite happy enough to animate her features and make her rejoice to talk of it.All that she could tell she told most gladly, but the all was little for one who had been there, and unsatisfactory for such an enquirer as Mrs. Smith, who had already heard, through the short cut of a laundress and a waiter, rather more of the general success and produce of the evening than Anne could relate, and who now asked in vain for several particulars of the company.Everybody of any consequence or notoriety in Bath was well know by name to Mrs. Smith."
"“我断定，矮子杜兰德一家也去了，”她说，“他们张着嘴巴听音乐，就像是羽翼未丰的麻雀等着喂食。他们从不错过一次音乐会。”","“The little Durands were there, I conclude,” said she, “with their mouths open to catch the music, like unfledged sparrows ready to be fed.They never miss a concert.”"
"“是的。我自己没有看见他们，不过我听埃利奥特先生说他们在音乐厅里。”","“Yes; I did not see them myself, but I heard Mr. Elliot say they were in the room.”"
"“伊博森一家，他们去了吗？那两个新来的美人和高个子的爱尔兰军官，据说他在追求她们中的一个。他们也去了吗？”","“The Ibbotsons, were they there? And the two new beauties, with the tall Irish officer, who is talked of for one of them.”"
"“我不知道。我想他们没去。”","“I do not know.I do not think they were.”"
"“玛丽•麦克莱恩老妇人呢？我不必问起她。我知道她从不缺席，你肯定看见她了。她肯定在你们那个圈子里，因为你既然是同达尔林普尔夫人一块去的，你们肯定坐在乐队附近的贵宾席上。”","“Old Lady Mary Maclean?I need not ask after her.She never misses, I know; and you must have seen her.She must have been in your own circle; for as you went with Lady Dalrymple, you were in the seats of grandeur, round the orchestra, of course.”"
"“不，我就怕坐在那儿。对我来说，不论从哪方面看都是极不愉快的。不过，幸好达尔林普尔夫人总是选择坐得远一些。我们的座位非常好，我是就听音乐而言。就看的方面来说，我就不能这么说了，因为我好像没看见什么。”","“No, that was what I dreaded.It would have been very unpleasant to me in every respect.But happily Lady Dalrymple always chooses to be farther off; and we were exceedingly well placed, that is, for hearing; I must not say for seeing, because I appear to have seen very little.”"
"“哦！你见到的已经够你高兴的了。我能理解。即使是在人群中也能享受到某种家庭的乐趣，你已经享受到了这种乐趣。你们所在的圈子是很大的一群人，你不需要圈外的一切了。”","“Oh! you saw enough for your own amusement.I can understand.There is a sort of domestic enjoyment to be known even in a crowd, and this you had.You were a large party in yourselves, and you wanted nothing beyond.”"
"“不过，我应该多看看四周的。”安妮说时也意识到了她当时实在没有必要向四处张望，她并不想看什么人。","“But I ought to have looked about me more,” said Anne, conscious while she spoke that there had in fact been no want of looking about, that the object only had been deficient."
"“不，不。你有更有意义的事情要干。你不用告诉我，你昨天晚上度过了一个愉快的夜晚。我从你的眼睛里看出来了。我完全看得出你的时光是怎么度过的：你总是有一些令人愉快的东西可以听。还有音乐会休息时间的聊天。”","“No, no; you were better employed.You need not tell me that you had a pleasant evening.I see it in your eye.I perfectly see how the hours passed: that you had always something agreeable to listen to.In the intervals of the concert it was conversation.”"
"安妮勉强一笑说道：“你从我眼睛里看出来了？”","Anne half smiled and said, “Do you see that in my eye?”"
"“是的，确实如此。你的神情让我清楚地看出了这一点，你昨天晚上是同你认为的世界上最可爱的那个人呆在一起，即使是现在，这个人对你产生的兴趣也比世界上所有的人加在一起要多。”","“Yes, I do.Your countenance perfectly informs me that you were in company last night with the person whom you think the most agreeable in the world, the person who interests you at this present time more than all the rest of the world put together.”"
"一阵红晕涌上了安妮的脸颊。她什么也没有说出来。","A blush overspread Anne’s cheeks.She could say nothing."
"“情况既然如此，”史密斯太太停了一小会儿继续说道，“我希望你能理解我感谢你今天早晨来看我的心情了。你一定有很多更愉快的事情要做，可是你却来陪我，你真是太好了。”","“And such being the case,” continued Mrs. Smith, after a short pause, “I hope you believe that I do know how to value your kindness in coming to me this morning.It is really very good of you to come and sit with me, when you must have so many pleasanter demands upon your time.”"
"安妮一点也没有听进去。她还处在她朋友的洞察力带给她的惊讶和困惑中，她无法想象温特沃思上校的情况怎么会传到她的耳朵里。又沉默了一会儿后——","Anne heard nothing of this.She was still in the astonishment and confusion excited by her friend’s penetration, unable to imagine how any report of Captain Wentworth could have reached her.After another short silence—"
"“请问，”史密斯太太说道，“埃利奥特先生知道你认识我吗？他知道我在巴斯吗？”","“Pray,” said Mrs. Smith, “is Mr. Elliot aware of your acquaintance with me?Does he know that I am in Bath?”"
"“埃利奥特先生！”安妮重复地叫了一声，惊讶地抬起头来。她沉思了一会儿才知道自己刚才想错了。她顿时醒悟过来了。某种安全感使她恢复了勇气，她马上更加镇静地接着说道：“你认识埃利奥特先生吗？”","“Mr. Elliot!” repeated Anne, looking up surprised.A moment’s reflection shewed her the mistake she had been under.She caught it instantaneously; and recovering her courage with the feeling of safety, soon added, more composedly, “Are you acquainted with Mr. Elliot?”"
"“我一向跟他很熟，”史密斯太太严肃地回答道，“不过，现在似乎不太往来了。我们已经很久没有见面了。”","“I have been a good deal acquainted with him,” replied Mrs. Smith, gravely, “but it seems worn out now.It is a great while since we met.”"
"“这件事我一点儿也不知道。你以前从来没有提起过。我要是早知道的话，我一定会很高兴地向他谈起你。”","“I was not at all aware of this.You never mentioned it before.Had I known it, I would have had the pleasure of talking to him about you.”"
"“说实话，”史密斯太太恢复了平常愉快的神情说，“这就是我希望的。我希望你能够向他谈起我。我需要你对他的影响。他可以帮我的大忙，我亲爱的埃利奥特小姐，如果你能够发发善心，把这件事当成自己的目标的话，一定会成功的。”","“To confess the truth,” said Mrs. Smith, assuming her usual air of cheerfulness, “that is exactly the pleasure I want you to have.I want you to talk about me to Mr. Elliot.I want your interest with him.He can be of essential service to me; and if you would have the goodness, my dear Miss Elliot, to make it an object to yourself, of course it is done.”"
"“我非常乐意。我想你不会怀疑我愿意帮你，哪怕有一点用也行，”安妮回答道，“不过，我觉得你认为我有权对埃利奥特先生提出更高的要求，有权影响他，而实际情况并非如此。我想你一定是不知怎么地产生了这种想法。你应该仅仅把我看成是埃利奥特先生的亲戚。从这点出发，如果你认为他的堂妹可以向他要求点什么的话，就请你毫不犹豫地告诉我好了。”","“I should be extremely happy; I hope you cannot doubt my willingness to be of even the slightest use to you,” replied Anne; “but I suspect that you are considering me as having a higher claim on Mr. Elliot, a greater right to influence him, than is really the case.I am sure you have, somehow or other, imbibed such a notion.You must consider me only as Mr. Elliot’s relation.If in that light there is anything which you suppose his cousin might fairly ask of him, I beg you would not hesitate to employ me.”"
"史密斯太太用敏锐地目光看了她一眼，然后笑眯眯地说：","Mrs. Smith gave her a penetrating glance, and then, smiling, said—"
"“我想，我有点操之过急了。请你原谅。我应该等你的正式通知的，不过现在，我亲爱的埃利奥特小姐，作为一个老朋友，请你务必给我点暗示，到底什么时候我才可以提这个要求。下星期？当然，下星期我大概可以认为一切都安排妥当了，就能够托埃利奥特先生的福为我自己谋点私利了。”","“I have been a little premature, I perceive; I beg your pardon.I ought to have waited for official information, But now, my dear Miss Elliot, as an old friend, do give me a hint as to when I may speak.Next week?To be sure by next week I may be allowed to think it all settled, and build my own selfish schemes on Mr. Elliot’s good fortune.”"
"“不，”安妮回答道，“下星期不行，下下星期也不行，下下下星期也不行。我向你保证，你设想的那件事情哪一个星期也定不下来。我不会嫁给埃利奥特先生的。我倒想知道，你怎么会觉得我会嫁给他？”","“No,” replied Anne, “nor next week, nor next, nor next.I assure you that nothing of the sort you are thinking of will be settled any week.I am not going to marry Mr. Elliot.I should like to know why you imagine I am?”"
"史密斯太太又看到她态度十分认真，笑了笑，摇了摇头，然后嚷道：","Mrs. Smith looked at her again, looked earnestly, smiled, shook her head, and exclaimed—"
"“现在，我多么希望我能够理解你！我多么希望我能知道你在想些什么！我非常清楚，时机一到，你就不会表现得这么残酷了。你知道，不到恰当的时间，我们女人从不想嫁人。女人总是这样，任何男人在提出求婚之前总会遭到拒绝。但是，你为什么要冷酷无情呢？虽然我不能称他为我现在的朋友，但请让我为我过去的朋友说几句好话。你在哪儿可以找到一个更合适的对象？你在哪儿能找到一个更有绅士风度、更可爱的男人呢？还是让我来介绍一下这位埃利奥特先生吧。我敢断定，你从沃利斯上校那里听到的都是关于他的好话。还有谁比沃利斯上校更了解他呢？”","“Now, how I do wish I understood you!How I do wish I knew what you were at!I have a great idea that you do not design to be cruel, when the right moment occurs.Till it does come, you know, we women never mean to have anybody.It is a thing of course among us, that every man is refused, till he offers.But why should you be cruel?Let me plead for my—present friend I cannot call him, but for my former friend.Where can you look for a more suitable match?Where could you expect a more gentlemanlike, agreeable man?Let me recommend Mr. Elliot.I am sure you hear nothing but good of him from Colonel Wallis; and who can know him better than Colonel Wallis?”"
"“我亲爱的史密斯太太，埃利奥特先生的妻子死了才半年多一点。他不应该追求别的女人。”","“My dear Mrs. Smith, Mr. Elliot’s wife has not been dead much above half a year.He ought not to be supposed to be paying his addresses to any one.”"
"“哦！如果这只是你的异议的话，”史密斯太太狡黠地嚷道，“那么埃利奥特先生就没问题了，我也不用再为他操心了。你们结婚的时候不要忘记告诉我就好了。让他知道我是你的朋友，那时他就会觉得我提的要求并不麻烦，现在他事多约会多，自然会尽量避免或摆脱这种麻烦，这也许是理所当然的。百分之九十九的人都会这么做。当然，他不会知道这件事对我有多么重要。好了，我亲爱的埃利奥特小姐，我希望而且相信你会非常幸福的。埃利奥特先生很有见识，会懂得你这样的女人的价值的。你的安宁不会像我这样遭到毁灭。在一切世事方面，你都将万无一失，你对他的性格也可以放心。他不会被引入歧途，也不会被别人误导走向毁灭。”","“Oh! if these are your only objections,” cried Mrs. Smith, archly, “Mr. Elliot is safe, and I shall give myself no more trouble about him.Do not forget me when you are married, that’s all.Let him know me to be a friend of yours, and then he will think little of the trouble required, which it is very natural for him now, with so many affairs and engagements of his own, to avoid and get rid of as he can; very natural, perhaps.Ninety-nine out of a hundred would do the same.Of course, he cannot be aware of the importance to me.Well, my dear Miss Elliot, I hope and trust you will be very happy.Mr. Elliot has sense to understand the value of such a woman.Your peace will not be shipwrecked as mine has been.You are safe in all worldly matters, and safe in his character.He will not be led astray; he will not be misled by others to his ruin.”"
"“对，”安妮说道，“在这些方面我是完全相信我的堂兄的。他看起来性情冷静果断，绝不会受到不好的影响。我非常尊重他。从我所观察的一切来看，我没有理由不这么做。但是，我认识他的时间不长，而且我觉得他是一个不太容易了解的人。我这样说他，史密斯太太，能不能使你相信，他对我来说是无足轻重的？的确，我说这话时心里很冷静。不过，我保证，我对他毫无感情。要是他向我求婚的话（我没有理由认为他会这样做），我也不会答应他的。我向你保证，我不会这样做。我向你保证，埃利奥特先生与你所想的昨晚的音乐会带给我的那种愉快之间没有什么关系，不是埃利奥特先生。不是埃利奥特先生——”","“No,” said Anne, “I can readily believe all that of my cousin.He seems to have a calm decided temper, not at all open to dangerous impressions.I consider him with great respect.I have no reason, from any thing that has fallen within my observation, to do otherwise.But I have not known him long; and he is not a man, I think, to be known intimately soon.Will not this manner of speaking of him, Mrs. Smith, convince you that he is nothing to me?Surely this must be calm enough.And, upon my word, he is nothing to me.Should he ever propose to me (which I have very little reason to imagine he has any thought of doing), I shall not accept him.I assure you I shall not.I assure you, Mr. Elliot had not the share which you have been supposing, in whatever pleasure the concert of last night might afford: not Mr. Elliot; it is not Mr. Elliot that—”"
"她红着脸停下了，深悔自己把事情透露得太多了。不过说少了又不行。要是史密斯太太不知道她另有心上人的话，是不大可能相信埃利奥特先生遭到了失败。事实上，她当即认输了，而且装作没有听出什么弦外之音。安妮急于想避开史密斯太太的进一步追问，却急切地想知道为什么史密斯太太会认为她将要嫁给埃利奥特先生。她怎么会产生这样的想法，或者是从谁那里听说的。","She stopped, regretting with a deep blush that she had implied so much; but less would hardly have been sufficient.Mrs. Smith would hardly have believed so soon in Mr. Elliot’s failure, but from the perception of there being a somebody else.As it was, she instantly submitted, and with all the semblance of seeing nothing beyond; and Anne, eager to escape farther notice, was impatient to know why Mrs. Smith should have fancied she was to marry Mr. Elliot; where she could have received the idea, or from whom she could have heard it."
"“请告诉我，你最初是怎么产生这种想法的。”","“Do tell me how it first came into your head.”"
"“我最初产生这种想法，”史密斯太太回答说，“是发现你们经常在一起，觉得这可能是最符合你们双方愿望的事情了。你可以相信，所有认识你们的人也都这么看。不过，我也是前两天才听说这件事。”","“It first came into my head,” replied Mrs. Smith, “upon finding how much you were together, and feeling it to be the most probable thing in the world to be wished for by everybody belonging to either of you; and you may depend upon it that all your acquaintance have disposed of you in the same way.But I never heard it spoken of till two days ago.”"
"“真有人谈论这件事吗？”","“And has it indeed been spoken of?”"
"“你昨天来的时候，有没有注意到给你开门的那个女人？”","“Did you observe the woman who opened the door to you when you called yesterday?”"
"“没有。不是平常开门的斯皮德太太或女佣人吗？我没有看到什么特别的人。”","“No.Was not it Mrs. Speed, as usual, or the maid?I observed no one in particular.”"
"“那是我的朋友鲁克太太，鲁克护士，顺便说一句，她非常好奇，想见见你，也很高兴能为你开门。她星期天才离开莫尔伯勒大厦，是她告诉我你即将同埃利奥特先生结婚的。她是听沃利斯太太亲口说的，看来消息还是挺有权威的。星期一的晚上她陪我坐了一个小时，把整个事情的来龙去脉都告诉了我。”“事情的来龙去脉，”安妮重复了一遍，笑了起来，“我想，对于这么一条毫无根据的小消息，她也没有什么可长篇大论的了。”","“It was my friend Mrs. Rooke; Nurse Rooke; who, by-the-bye, had a great curiosity to see you, and was delighted to be in the way to let you in.She came away from Marlborough Buildings only on Sunday; and she it was who told me you were to marry Mr. Elliot.She had had it from Mrs. Wallis herself, which did not seem bad authority.She sat an hour with me on Monday evening, and gave me the whole history.”“The whole history,” repeated Anne, laughing.“She could not make a very long history, I think, of one such little article of unfounded news.”"
"史密斯太太什么也没说。","Mrs. Smith said nothing."
"“不过，”安妮马上接着说下去，“尽管事实上我并不会嫁给埃利奥特先生，但我还是非常乐意尽我所能来帮助你。我要不要告诉他你在巴斯？要不要我给他捎个话？”","“But,” continued Anne, presently, “though there is no truth in my having this claim on Mr. Elliot, I should be extremely happy to be of use to you in any way that I could.Shall I mention to him your being in Bath?Shall I take any message?”"
"“不，谢谢你。不，当然不用。刚才我可能太激动了，而且处于一种错误的印象，想要劝你关心一下那事。不过，现在不需要了。不，谢谢你，我没有什么事情要麻烦你了。”","“No, I thank you: no, certainly not.In the warmth of the moment, and under a mistaken impression, I might, perhaps, have endeavoured to interest you in some circumstances; but not now.No, I thank you, I have nothing to trouble you with.”"
"“我记得你说过，你跟埃利奥特先生认识很多年了？”","“I think you spoke of having known Mr. Elliot many years?”"
"“是的。”","“I did.”"
"“我想，不会是在他结婚以前吧？”","“Not before he was married, I suppose?”"
"“是的。我刚认识他的时候，他还没有结婚。”","“Yes; he was not married when I knew him first.”"
"“你们——很熟吗？”","“And—were you much acquainted?”"
"“非常熟。”","“Intimately.”"
"“真的！那么请告诉我他那时是什么样子。我非常好奇，想知道埃利奥特先生年轻时是个什么样的人。他是不是同现在一个样？”","“Indeed!Then do tell me what he was at that time of life.I have a great curiosity to know what Mr. Elliot was as a very young man.Was he at all such as he appears now?”"
"“这三年来，我一直没有见过埃利奥特先生，”史密斯太太回答时神情非常严肃，让人简直无法继续谈下去。安妮自己一无所获，反而好奇心更强了。两人都默不作声。史密斯太太显得心事重重。终于——","“I have not seen Mr. Elliot these three years,” was Mrs. Smith’s answer, given so gravely that it was impossible to pursue the subject farther; and Anne felt that she had gained nothing but an increase of curiosity.They were both silent: Mrs. Smith very thoughtful.At last—"
"“请原谅，我亲爱的埃利奥特小姐，”她用她自然的热情口气大声说道，“请原谅我刚才给你的回答太简短了，不过我一直没拿定主意，我到底应该怎么办。我一直在犹豫不决，考虑我该怎么对你说才好。我有很多问题需要考虑。人们讨厌爱管闲事、搬弄是非、挑拨离间的人。连家庭关系中平静的表象也值得维持，尽管在这种关系中可能没有什么会是持久的。不过，我决定了。我认为我是对的。我觉得应该让你了解一下埃利奥特先生的本性。虽然现在我完全相信你丝毫没有想要嫁给他，但是谁也说不准今后会怎么样。你将来也许会对他产生不一样的感情。所以还是趁你现在还没有偏见的时候听一听真相吧。埃利奥特先生是个没有心肝和良心的人。他是个诡计多端、谨小慎微、冷酷无情的家伙。只考虑自己了，为了自己的利益和舒适，只要不有损于他的声誉，什么残酷无情或背信弃义的事情他都干得出来。他从来不考虑别人的感受。对于那些主要因为他而破产的人，他可以无动于衷地一脚踢开，而没有丝毫的懊悔之心。他完全没有任何正义感和同情心。唉！他的心是黑的，虚伪而又狠毒！”","“I beg your pardon, my dear Miss Elliot,” she cried, in her natural tone of cordiality, “I beg your pardon for the short answers I have been giving you, but I have been uncertain what I ought to do.I have been doubting and considering as to what I ought to tell you.There were many things to be taken into the account.One hates to be officious, to be giving bad impressions, making mischief.Even the smooth surface of family-union seems worth preserving, though there may be nothing durable beneath.However, I have determined; I think I am right; I think you ought to be made acquainted with Mr. Elliot’s real character.Though I fully believe that, at present, you have not the smallest intention of accepting him, there is no saying what may happen.You might, some time or other, be differently affected towards him.Hear the truth, therefore, now, while you are unprejudiced.Mr. Elliot is a man without heart or conscience; a designing, wary, cold-blooded being, who thinks only of himself; whom for his own interest or ease, would be guilty of any cruelty, or any treachery, that could be perpetrated without risk of his general character.He has no feeling for others.Those whom he has been the chief cause of leading into ruin, he can neglect and desert without the smallest compunction.He is totally beyond the reach of any sentiment of justice or compassion.Oh! he is black at heart, hollow and black!”"
"安妮听得目瞪口呆，发出了一声惊叹，使得史密斯太太顿了一下，接着又说下去，稍微平静了一点：","Anne’s astonished air, and exclamation of wonder, made her pause, and in a calmer manner, she added,"
"“我的说法使你大吃一惊。你得原谅一个受到伤害而感到愤怒的女人。不过，我会尽量控制我自己的。我不想毁谤他。我只想告诉你我对他的了解。事实将会说明一切。他是我亲爱丈夫的密友，我的丈夫信任他，喜欢他，认为他同自己一样是个好人。他们的这种亲密关系在我们结婚之前就已经形成了。我发现他们是最亲密的朋友。因此我也非常喜欢埃利奥特先生，对他的评价很高。你知道，一个人在十九岁的时候考虑问题并不很认真。不过，当时我觉得埃利奥特先生的人品像其他人一样好，而且比其他人讨人喜欢，因此我们几乎总是呆在一起。我们主要住在城里，生活阔绰。他当时的情况比较差，也比较穷。他在坦普尔有住房，但这是他为了装点绅士的门面而做的一切。只要他愿意，随时可以住在我们家里；他总是受欢迎的；他就像我们的兄弟。我那可怜的查尔斯，是这世上最善良、最慷慨大方的人，他就是剩下最后四分之一便士，也会分给埃利奥特先生。我知道他的钱包是对埃利奥特先生敞开的，我知道他经常资助他。”","“My expressions startle you.You must allow for an injured, angry woman.But I will try to command myself.I will not abuse him.I will only tell you what I have found him.Facts shall speak.He was the intimate friend of my dear husband, who trusted and loved him, and thought him as good as himself.The intimacy had been formed before our marriage.I found them most intimate friends; and I, too, became excessively pleased with Mr. Elliot, and entertained the highest opinion of him.At nineteen, you know, one does not think very seriously; but Mr. Elliot appeared to me quite as good as others, and much more agreeable than most others, and we were almost always together.We were principally in town, living in very good style.He was then the inferior in circumstances; he was then the poor one; he had chambers in the Temple, and it was as much as he could do to support the appearance of a gentleman.He had always a home with us whenever he chose it; he was always welcome; he was like a brother.My poor Charles, who had the finest, most generous spirit in the world, would have divided his last farthing with him; and I know that his purse was open to him; I know that he often assisted him.”"
"“想必大约就是在这个时期，”安妮说道，“埃利奥特先生总是使我感到特别好奇。这肯定就是我父亲和姐姐刚刚认识他的时候。我自己从来没有见过他，只是听说过他。但是我无论如何也没法把他当时对我父亲和姐姐的态度以及他以后的婚姻状况同他现在的态度协调起来。这似乎表明他是另外一种人。”","“This must have been about that very period of Mr. Elliot’s life,” said Anne, “which has always excited my particular curiosity.It must have been about the same time that he became known to my father and sister.I never knew him myself; I only heard of him; but there was a something in his conduct then, with regard to my father and sister, and afterwards in the circumstances of his marriage, which I never could quite reconcile with present times.It seemed to announce a different sort of man.”"
"“这些事我全知道，这些我全了解，”史密斯太太大声嚷道。“他同你父亲和姐姐结识，是在我认识他之前，但我常听他谈起他们。我知道他们邀请他、鼓励他，我也知道他不肯去。也许我可以给你提供一些你意想不到的事情。至于他的婚姻，我当时了解得一清二楚。我知道他追求什么，也知道他反对什么。他把他的打算和计划都告诉了我这个朋友。虽然我之前并不认识他的妻子，确实她的低微社会地位使我不可能同她结识。不过我对她后来的情况了解得一清二楚，至少知道她去世之前的前两年的生活。我可以回答你想提出的任何问题。”","“I know it all, I know it all,” cried Mrs. Smith.“He had been introduced to Sir Walter and your sister before I was acquainted with him, but I heard him speak of them for ever.I know he was invited and encouraged, and I know he did not choose to go.I can satisfy you, perhaps, on points which you would little expect; and as to his marriage, I knew all about it at the time.I was privy to all the fors and againsts; I was the friend to whom he confided his hopes and plans; and though I did not know his wife previously, her inferior situation in society, indeed, rendered that impossible, yet I knew her all her life afterwards, or at least till within the last two years of her life, and can answer any question you may wish to put.”"
"“不，”安妮说道，“我对她没有什么特别要问的。我一直知道他们并不是一对幸福的夫妻。不过我想知道，他那个时候为什么蔑视同我父亲的交往。我父亲的确想给他友好、妥善的照顾。为什么埃利奥特先生不愿意与我父亲交往？”","“Nay,” said Anne, “I have no particular enquiry to make about her.I have always understood they were not a happy couple.But I should like to know why, at that time of his life, he should slight my father’s acquaintance as he did.My father was certainly disposed to take very kind and proper notice of him.Why did Mr. Elliot draw back?”"
"“埃利奥特先生，”史密斯太太回答道，“那个时候他只有一个目标：发财致富，而且想通过比继承遗产更快的捷径实现。他决定通过婚姻来实现。他决定至少不能让草率的婚姻来损害这个目标。我知道他认为（当然我无法判断这是否正确）你父亲和姐姐对他这么客气，一再地发出邀请，是想让他这继承人同年轻的埃利奥特小姐结婚，而这样的婚姻不可能满足他对财富和自立的思想。我向你保证，这是他不愿意同你们家往来的动机。他把事情都告诉了我。他对我没有隐瞒。奇怪的是，我在巴斯刚同你分手，结婚后遇到的第一个主要的熟人就是你的堂兄，而且时时听他说起你的父亲和姐姐。他描述了一位埃利奥特小姐，而我内心却非常想念另一位埃利奥特小姐。”","“Mr. Elliot,” replied Mrs. Smith, “at that period of his life, had one object in view: to make his fortune, and by a rather quicker process than the law.He was determined to make it by marriage.He was determined, at least, not to mar it by an imprudent marriage; and I know it was his belief (whether justly or not, of course I cannot decide), that your father and sister, in their civilities and invitations, were designing a match between the heir and the young lady, and it was impossible that such a match should have answered his ideas of wealth and independence.That was his motive for drawing back, I can assure you.He told me the whole story.He had no concealments with me.It was curious, that having just left you behind me in Bath, my first and principal acquaintance on marrying should be your cousin; and that, through him, I should be continually hearing of your father and sister.He described one Miss Elliot, and I thought very affectionately of the other.”"
"“也许，”安妮突然想到了一点，高声说道，“你时常向埃利奥特先生谈起我吧？”","“Perhaps,” cried Anne, struck by a sudden idea, “you sometimes spoke of me to Mr. Elliot?”"
"“当然啦，常常谈起。我常常夸奖我心爱的安妮•埃利奥特，而且担保你是一个与众不同的人，不同于——”","“To be sure I did; very often.I used to boast of my own Anne Elliot, and vouch for your being a very different creature from—”"
"史密斯太太及时打住了。","She checked herself just in time."
"“这就解释了埃利奥特先生昨天晚上讲的话，”安妮高声说道。“这就好解释了。我听说他以前经常听别人谈起我。我无法理解这究竟是怎么回事。只要事情一涉及个人，就会产生多么荒唐的想象啊！而且总会出错！不过，请原谅我。我打断了你的话。这么说，埃利奥特先生那时完全是为了钱而结婚的？也许，这个情况使你开始认清了他的真面目。”","“This accounts for something which Mr. Elliot said last night,” cried Anne.“This explains it.I found he had been used to hear of me.I could not comprehend how.What wild imaginations one forms where dear self is concerned!How sure to be mistaken!But I beg your pardon; I have interrupted you.Mr. Elliot married then completely for money?The circumstances, probably, which first opened your eyes to his character.”"
"这时，史密斯太太犹豫了一会儿。“哎！这种事情太常见了。人生在世，一个男人或女人为了钱而结婚的事情太常见了，不会使人对此产生应有的惊讶。我当时很年轻，只跟年轻人来往，我们是一群粗心大意的快乐年轻人，没有任何严格的行为准则。我们活着就是为了享乐。现在我可不这么想了。时间、疾病和忧愁使我产生了别的想法。不过我必须承认，我当时觉得埃利奥特先生的行为没有什么可指责的。‘为自己寻找最好的出路’，被当成了一种职责。”","Mrs. Smith hesitated a little here.“Oh! those things are too common.When one lives in the world, a man or woman’s marrying for money is too common to strike one as it ought.I was very young, and associated only with the young, and we were a thoughtless, gay set, without any strict rules of conduct.We lived for enjoyment.I think differently now; time and sickness and sorrow have given me other notions; but at that period I must own I saw nothing reprehensible in what Mr. Elliot was doing.‘To do the best for himself,’ passed as a duty.”"
"“可是她不是一个出身低贱的女人吗？”","“But was not she a very low woman?”"
"“是的。对此我表示过反对，但是埃利奥特先生并不尊重我的意见。钱，钱，他要的只是钱。她父亲是个牧场主，她祖父曾经是个屠夫，但是这都无所谓。她是一位漂亮的女人，受过体面的教育，是由几个表亲带出来的，偶然遇到了埃利奥特先生，并且爱上了他。而埃利奥特先生对她的出身毫不计较，也不顾忌。他竭尽全力地弄清楚了她的财产的真实数字，然后才答应娶她。你相信我好了，埃利奥特先生目前可能对他的社会地位非常看重，但是年轻的时候，他对此却毫不重视。他有可能得到凯林奇府，但是他把家族的荣誉视为粪土。我经常听他宣称，要是准男爵这个称号可以出售，任何人只要出五十英镑就可以买去，包括族徽和徽文，姓氏和仆人的制服。不过我说的这些话是否有重复过去听他说的一半那么多，我还不敢肯定。那不太公平，你应该有证据，我的话口说无凭，不过你会看到证据的。”","“Yes; which I objected to, but he would not regard.Money, money, was all that he wanted.Her father was a grazier, her grandfather had been a butcher, but that was all nothing.She was a fine woman, had had a decent education, was brought forward by some cousins, thrown by chance into Mr. Elliot’s company, and fell in love with him; and not a difficulty or a scruple was there on his side, with respect to her birth.All his caution was spent in being secured of the real amount of her fortune, before he committed himself.Depend upon it, whatever esteem Mr. Elliot may have for his own situation in life now, as a young man he had not the smallest value for it.His chance for the Kellynch estate was something, but all the honour of the family he held as cheap as dirt.I have often heard him declare, that if baronetcies were saleable, anybody should have his for fifty pounds, arms and motto, name and livery included; but I will not pretend to repeat half that I used to hear him say on that subject.It would not be fair; and yet you ought to have proof, for what is all this but assertion, and you shall have proof.”"
"“我亲爱的史密斯太太，我确实不需要什么证据，”安妮大声说。“你说的这一切与埃利奥特先生几年前表现出来的样子毫不矛盾。相反，这都证实了我们过去听到的和想到的。我更想知道的是，他现在为什么变得这么不一样了。”","“Indeed, my dear Mrs. Smith, I want none,” cried Anne.“You have asserted nothing contradictory to what Mr. Elliot appeared to be some years ago.This is all in confirmation, rather, of what we used to hear and believe.I am more curious to know why he should be so different now.”"
"“不过我倒想拿出证据来给你看看，要是你能打铃叫一下玛丽。等一等，我想你更愿意亲自到我的卧室去，把那只小小的镶花的小匣子拿来，你能在壁橱的上格找到它。”","“But for my satisfaction, if you will have the goodness to ring for Mary; stay: I am sure you will have the still greater goodness of going yourself into my bedroom, and bringing me the small inlaid box which you will find on the upper shelf of the closet.”"
"安妮看到她的朋友执意要她去一趟，就按她的愿望去了。小匣子拿来了，就放在史密斯太太跟前，她一边叹了口气，一边把它打开，说：","Anne, seeing her friend to be earnestly bent on it, did as she was desired.The box was brought and placed before her, and Mrs. Smith, sighing over it as she unlocked it, said—"
"“这里面装满了我丈夫的文件。这仅仅是我丈夫去世时我不得不查阅的文件中的一小部分。我要找的这封信是我们结婚以前埃利奥特先生写给我丈夫的，它恰巧给保存下来了。为什么会保存，人们简直无法想象。我丈夫像别的男人一样，对这些东西都漫不经心，非常随便。我开始检查他的信件的时候，我发现它夹在到处散放着的比它更没有价值的信件中间，而许多真正重要的信件和备忘录却被毁掉了。就是这封。我当时没有把它烧掉，因为我当时对埃利奥特先生已经不太满意，我决定把有关以前我们亲密关系的证据都留下来。现在我又有一个理由为能够提供这封信而感到高兴了。”","“This is full of papers belonging to him, to my husband; a small portion only of what I had to look over when I lost him.The letter I am looking for was one written by Mr. Elliot to him before our marriage, and happened to be saved; why, one can hardly imagine.But he was careless and immethodical, like other men, about those things; and when I came to examine his papers, I found it with others still more trivial, from different people scattered here and there, while many letters and memorandums of real importance had been destroyed.Here it is; I would not burn it, because being even then very little satisfied with Mr. Elliot, I was determined to preserve every document of former intimacy.I have now another motive for being glad that I can produce it.”"
"这封信是早在1803年7月从伦敦寄往“坦布里奇韦尔斯，查尔斯•史密斯先生收”的：","This was the letter, directed to “Charles Smith, Esq. Tunbridge Wells,” and dated from London, as far back as July, 1803:—"
"“亲爱的史密斯：来信收到。你的好意几乎使我感激涕零。但愿大自然造就更多像你这样的好心人，但我在世上活了23年了，还没有遇见过像你这样的好心人。相信我，目前我不需要你的帮助，因为我又有钱了。为我高兴吧。我已经摆脱了沃尔特爵士和埃利奥特小姐。他们回凯林奇去了，几乎逼着我发誓这个夏天去拜访他们。不过我第一次去凯林奇的时候要带上一个勘探员，好弄清楚怎样才能在拍卖时卖个最好的价钱。不过，准男爵并不是不可能再娶。他可真够愚蠢的。然而，要是他再娶，他们倒不会再来打搅我，这完全可以抵得上那份继承权。他比去年更糟糕了。","“Dear Smith,—I have received yours.Your kindness almost overpowers me.I wish nature had made such hearts as yours more common, but I have lived three-and-twenty years in the world, and have seen none like it.At present, believe me, I have no need of your services, being in cash again.Give me joy: I have got rid of Sir Walter and Miss.They are gone back to Kellynch, and almost made me swear to visit them this summer; but my first visit to Kellynch will be with a surveyor, to tell me how to bring it with best advantage to the hammer.The baronet, nevertheless, is not unlikely to marry again; he is quite fool enough.If he does, however, they will leave me in peace, which may be a decent equivalent for the reversion.He is worse than last year."
"“我希望除了埃利奥特之外，我姓什么都可以。我讨厌这个姓氏。谢天谢地，我可以不用沃尔特这个名字！我希望你永远不要用我的中间名字‘沃’来羞辱我。我今后永远是你忠实的——威廉•埃利奥特。”","“I wish I had any name but Elliot.I am sick of it.The name of Walter I can drop, thank God! And I desire you will never insult me with my second W. again, meaning, for the rest of my life, to be only yours truly,—Wm.Elliot.”"
"读着这样的信，安妮不得不感到脸红。史密斯太太看到安妮通红的脸，说：","Such a letter could not be read without putting Anne in a glow; and Mrs. Smith, observing the high colour in her face, said—"
"“我知道，信里的用词非常无礼。虽然我已经忘记了具体的措辞，但是我对这封信的大意还有个完整的印象。不过，这可以使你看清他的为人。看看他对我可怜的丈夫说的话。还有比这更有力的证据吗？”","“The language, I know, is highly disrespectful.Though I have forgot the exact terms, I have a perfect impression of the general meaning.But it shows you the man.Mark his professions to my poor husband.Can any thing be stronger?”"
"看到埃利奥特用这样的言辞侮辱她的父亲，安妮无法从震惊与屈辱中立刻摆脱出来。安妮不得不想到，她看这封信是违背道德的，人们无法拿着这样的证词去判断或了解一个人，私人信件是不容许别人过目的。然后，她恢复了平静，把刚才拿在手上苦思冥想的信还给史密斯太太，说道：","Anne could not immediately get over the shock and mortification of finding such words applied to her father.She was obliged to recollect that her seeing the letter was a violation of the laws of honour, that no one ought to be judged or to be known by such testimonies, that no private correspondence could bear the eye of others, before she could recover calmness enough to return the letter which she had been meditating over, and say—"
"“谢谢你。这个证据无疑很充分，证实了你刚才所说的一切。但是现在他又为什么同我们交往呢？”","“Thank you.This is full proof undoubtedly; proof of every thing you were saying.But why be acquainted with us now?”"
"“这我也能解释，”史密斯太太笑着喊道。","“I can explain this too,” cried Mrs. Smith, smiling."
"“你真能解释吗？”","“Can you really?”"
"“是的。我已经让你看清了埃利奥特先生十二年前的为人，我也会让你看清他现在的为人。我没法再拿出书面证据，不过，我给你的口头证据完全像你要求的那么可靠。我要告诉你，他现在想要什么，他现在在做什么。他现在不是一个伪君子了。他确实想娶你。他目前对你们家的关注是非常真诚的：完全是发自内心的。我要告诉你我的消息的权威来源：他的朋友沃利斯上校。”","“Yes.I have shewn you Mr. Elliot as he was a dozen years ago, and I will shew him as he is now.I cannot produce written proof again, but I can give as authentic oral testimony as you can desire, of what he is now wanting, and what he is now doing.He is no hypocrite now.He truly wants to marry you.His present attentions to your family are very sincere: quite from the heart.I will give you my authority: his friend Colonel Wallis.”"
"“沃利斯上校！你认识他？”","“Colonel Wallis!you are acquainted with him?”"
"“不认识。消息不是这么直接传到我耳朵里的。它转了一两个弯，不过没有什么影响。泉水就像源头一样清洁，它带上的垃圾很容易在转弯时撇掉。埃利奥特先生毫无保留地向沃利斯上校谈了他对你的看法。我想沃利斯上校本人是一位通情达理、谨慎而又有眼力的人，但是沃利斯上校有一位非常美丽却很愚蠢的妻子，而他把他不该说的事情全部都告诉了妻子。她身体处在恢复期，精力充沛，就把这一切都告诉了她的护士。而这位护士又知道我认识你，自然就把事情全部告诉了我。星期一的晚上，我的好朋友鲁克太太就把莫尔伯勒的许多秘密都告诉了我。所以你瞧，我先前说我知道事情的来龙去脉时，并不像你想象的那么夸大其词。”","“No.It does not come to me in quite so direct a line as that; it takes a bend or two, but nothing of consequence.The stream is as good as at first; the little rubbish it collects in the turnings is easily moved away.Mr. Elliot talks unreservedly to Colonel Wallis of his views on you, which said Colonel Wallis, I imagine to be, in himself, a sensible, careful, discerning sort of character; but Colonel Wallis has a very pretty silly wife, to whom he tells things which he had better not, and he repeats it all to her.She in the overflowing spirits of her recovery, repeats it all to her nurse; and the nurse knowing my acquaintance with you, very naturally brings it all to me.On Monday evening, my good friend Mrs. Rooke let me thus much into the secrets of Marlborough Buildings.When I talked of a whole history, therefore, you see I was not romancing so much as you supposed.”"
"“我亲爱的史密斯太太，你这话的权威性还不足。这不能够说明问题。埃利奥特先生对我有什么看法，绝对不可能是他努力同我父亲和解的原因。和解发生在我来巴斯之前。我来的时候，发现他们的关系极为友好。”","“My dear Mrs. Smith, your authority is deficient.This will not do.Mr. Elliot’s having any views on me will not in the least account for the efforts he made towards a reconciliation with my father.That was all prior to my coming to Bath.I found them on the most friendly terms when I arrived.”"
"“我知道，我完全知道，但是——”","“I know you did; I know it all perfectly, but—”"
"“说真的，史密斯太太，我们不能期望通过这种方式了解真实情况。中间经过这么多人，有人出于愚蠢，有人出于无知，都会给曲解了，经过这些人传来传去，事实或看法就很难剩下什么真实性的内容了。”","“Indeed, Mrs. Smith, we must not expect to get real information in such a line.Facts or opinions which are to pass through the hands of so many, to be misconceived by folly in one, and ignorance in another, can hardly have much truth left.”"
"“你只要听我讲就行了。你通过听我讲述一些能让你自己立刻加以反驳或证实的细节，你就能很快对我的话的总体可信程度作出判断。没有人认为你是他的第一个诱惑。他在来到巴斯以前确实见到过你而且很倾慕你，但是还不知道你是谁。至少告诉我情况的那些人是这么说的。这是真的吗？去年夏天或秋天，他见过你，用她自己的话来说，‘是在西边什么地方’，当时又不知道那是你，是不是？”","“Only give me a hearing.You will soon be able to judge of the general credit due, by listening to some particulars which you can yourself immediately contradict or confirm.Nobody supposes that you were his first inducement.He had seen you indeed, before he came to Bath, and admired you, but without knowing it to be you.So says my historian, at least.Is this true?Did he see you last summer or autumn, ‘somewhere down in the west,’ to use her own words, without knowing it to be you?”"
"“他确实见过我。到目前为止，都是正确的。是在莱姆。当时我碰巧在莱姆。”","“He certainly did.So far it is very true.At Lyme.I happened to be at Lyme.”"
"“好的，”史密斯太太得意洋洋地继续说道，“既然第一点是肯定的，那就证明我的朋友是可信的。埃利奥特先生那时在莱姆见到了你，而且非常喜欢你，后来在卡姆登巷再见到你，知道你是埃利奥特小姐时，他非常高兴。我深信，从那时起，他去登门拜访便有了双重动机。但是他还有一个动机，是早就有的，现在我就来解释。如果你知道我说的情况有什么虚假或不真实的地方，就打断我好了。我了解的情况是这样的，你姐姐的朋友，就是我曾经听你提起过的跟你们住在一起的夫人，早在九月份（总之他们刚来的时候）就与埃利奥特小姐和沃尔特爵士一起到巴斯来了，而且从那时起一直呆在这里。她是一个八面玲珑、善于献媚的漂亮女人，人虽穷嘴却巧。总的来说，她的处境和举止给沃尔特爵士的熟人留下了一个大致的印象，就是她想成为埃利奥特夫人；同样使大家感到惊讶的是，埃利奥特小姐显然看不到这个危险。”","“Well,” continued Mrs. Smith, triumphantly, “grant my friend the credit due to the establishment of the first point asserted.He saw you then at Lyme, and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased to meet with you again in Camden Place, as Miss Anne Elliot, and from that moment, I have no doubt, had a double motive in his visits there.But there was another, and an earlier, which I will now explain.If there is anything in my story which you know to be either false or improbable, stop me.My account states, that your sister’s friend, the lady now staying with you, whom I have heard you mention, came to Bath with Miss Elliot and Sir Walter as long ago as September (in short when they first came themselves), and has been staying there ever since; that she is a clever, insinuating, handsome woman, poor and plausible, and altogether such in situation and manner, as to give a general idea, among Sir Walter’s acquaintance, of her meaning to be Lady Elliot, and as general a surprise that Miss Elliot should be apparently, blind to the danger.”"
"说到这里，史密斯太太停了片刻。见安妮没有什么可说的，便接着说下去：","Here Mrs. Smith paused a moment; but Anne had not a word to say, and she continued—"
"“早在你回家之前，认识你们家的人就有了这种看法。沃利斯上校虽说那时没有去拜访卡姆登巷，但他很注意你父亲，觉察到了这个情况。他很关心埃利奥特先生，因此对府上的一切也很留意，恰巧埃利奥特先生在圣诞前夕要来巴斯小住上一两天，沃利斯上校便告诉了他一些情况，于是人们这些情况开始流传了。你要明白，随着时间的推移，埃利奥特先生对准男爵的价值的看法发生了重大的变化。在血统和亲戚方面，他完全判若两人。他早就已经有足够的钱供他挥霍，既然在贪婪和享乐方面他没有什么可追求的，那么他逐渐懂得要把自己的幸福寄托在他要继承的社会地位上面。我想他和我不再往来之前就有了这样的想法，不过现在这个想法已经根深蒂固了。他不能够容忍不能成为威廉爵士这个想法。因此你可以猜到，他从他朋友那里听到这个消息后不可能很愉快，你也可以猜到这消息产生的结果。他决定尽快回到巴斯，在这里住上一段时间，目的是恢复以前的交往，恢复他在你家中的地位，以便弄清他现在处境的危险程度，如果危险很大，他就设法打败那个女人。这是两位朋友一致认为的唯一可行办法。沃利斯上校竭尽全力地给予帮助。埃利奥特先生把沃利斯上校引荐给你的家人，也把沃利斯太太引荐给你的家人，把每个人引荐给你的家人。于是，埃利奥特先生回来了。而且正如你知道的那样，他的请求得到了原谅，被你的家人重新接纳。在这里他还有一个坚定不移的目标，也是唯一的目标（直到你的到来为他增添了另一个动机），就是盯住沃尔特爵士和克莱太太。他不放过与他们在一起的机会，硬是夹在他们之间，不断地登门拜访。不过在这方面我没有必要细说。你可以想象一个狡猾的人会使出怎样的伎俩。也许这么一开导，你就可以回想起你见到他做过的一些事情。”","“This was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family, long before you returned to it; and Colonel Wallis had his eye upon your father enough to be sensible of it, though he did not then visit in Camden Place; but his regard for Mr. Elliot gave him an interest in watching all that was going on there, and when Mr. Elliot came to Bath for a day or two, as he happened to do a little before Christmas, Colonel Wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things, and the reports beginning to prevail.Now you are to understand, that time had worked a very material change in Mr. Elliot’s opinions as to the value of a baronetcy.Upon all points of blood and connexion he is a completely altered man.Having long had as much money as he could spend, nothing to wish for on the side of avarice or indulgence, he has been gradually learning to pin his happiness upon the consequence he is heir to.I thought it coming on before our acquaintance ceased, but it is now a confirmed feeling.He cannot bear the idea of not being Sir William.You may guess, therefore, that the news he heard from his friend could not be very agreeable, and you may guess what it produced; the resolution of coming back to Bath as soon as possible, and of fixing himself here for a time, with the view of renewing his former acquaintance, and recovering such a footing in the family as might give him the means of ascertaining the degree of his danger, and of circumventing the lady if he found it material.This was agreed upon between the two friends as the only thing to be done; and Colonel Wallis was to assist in every way that he could.He was to be introduced, and Mrs. Wallis was to be introduced, and everybody was to be introduced.Mr. Elliot came back accordingly; and on application was forgiven, as you know, and re-admitted into the family; and there it was his constant object, and his only object (till your arrival added another motive), to watch Sir Walter and Mrs. Clay.He omitted no opportunity of being with them, threw himself in their way, called at all hours; but I need not be particular on this subject.You can imagine what an artful man would do; and with this guide, perhaps, may recollect what you have seen him do.”"
"“是的，”安妮说，“你告诉我的一切都符合我已经知道或可以想象的情况。施展诡计的细节总是令人讨厌。那些自私狡诈的小动作从来就让人恶心，不过我没有听到真正让我吃惊的事情。我知道有些人听到你这样议论埃利奥特先生会大吃一惊，会难以置信。不过我并不满足于对他的一知半解。我总想知道隐藏在他行为的表面现象下的某种其他的动机。我倒想知道他现在如何看待他一直担心的那件事的可能性。他是否认为危险已经减少。”","“Yes,” said Anne, “you tell me nothing which does not accord with what I have known, or could imagine.There is always something offensive in the details of cunning.The manoeuvres of selfishness and duplicity must ever be revolting, but I have heard nothing which really surprises me.I know those who would be shocked by such a representation of Mr. Elliot, who would have difficulty in believing it; but I have never been satisfied.I have always wanted some other motive for his conduct than appeared.I should like to know his present opinion, as to the probability of the event he has been in dread of; whether he considers the danger to be lessening or not.”"
"“我想，他觉得是减少了，”史密斯太太回答道，“他认为克莱太太怕他，知道他看透了她，不像他不在的时候那样胆大妄为了。不过既然他迟早总要离开的，而克莱太太现在还保持着她的影响，我看不出埃利奥特先生有什么可长久保险的。护士告诉我，沃利斯太太有个好笑的主意，就是在你和埃利奥特先生结婚的时候，要在婚约中加上一条：你父亲不能与克莱太太结婚。看来这一计策也只有沃利斯太太才想得出来。不过我那明智的鲁克太太看出了其中的荒谬。‘不过，说真的，太太，’她说，‘这不能阻止他去娶别人啊。’而且的确说真的，我觉得鲁克护士并不从心底里坚决反对沃尔特爵士再娶。你知道，应该允许她成为男婚女嫁的赞成者。而且（既然涉及到个人利益）谁能说她没有不着边际的幻想，希望通过沃利斯太太的推荐，可能服侍下一位埃利奥特夫人呢？”","“Lessening, I understand,” replied Mrs. Smith.“He thinks Mrs. Clay afraid of him, aware that he sees through her, and not daring to proceed as she might do in his absence.But since he must be absent some time or other, I do not perceive how he can ever be secure while she holds her present influence.Mrs. Wallis has an amusing idea, as nurse tells me, that it is to be put into the marriage articles when you and Mr. Elliot marry, that your father is not to marry Mrs. Clay.A scheme, worthy of Mrs. Wallis’s understanding, by all accounts; but my sensible nurse Rooke sees the absurdity of it.‘Why, to be sure, ma’am,’ said she, ‘it would not prevent his marrying anybody else.’And, indeed, to own the truth, I do not think nurse, in her heart, is a very strenuous opposer of Sir Walter’s making a second match.She must be allowed to be a favourer of matrimony, you know; and (since self will intrude) who can say that she may not have some flying visions of attending the next Lady Elliot, through Mrs. Wallis’s recommendation?”"
"“我非常高兴能够知道这一切，”安妮沉思了一会儿，说道，“从某些方面来说，今后与他相处会使我感到痛苦，不过我更知道该怎么办了。我的行为方式将会更为直率。显然埃利奥特先生是个虚伪、做作、世故的人，除了自私自利以外，他从来没有过更好的处世原则。”","“I am very glad to know all this,” said Anne, after a little thoughtfulness.“It will be more painful to me in some respects to be in company with him, but I shall know better what to do.My line of conduct will be more direct.Mr. Elliot is evidently a disingenuous, artificial, worldly man, who has never had any better principle to guide him than selfishness.”"
"但是关于埃利奥特先生的事情还没有讲完。刚才史密斯太太说着说着便偏离了自己最初的方向，而安妮只顾担心自己家的情况，忘记了史密斯太太最初对他不满的那些暗示。不过安妮的注意力现在集中到对史密斯太太最初暗示的解释上来了。安妮听着她的倾诉，这些即使不能证明史密斯太太对埃利奥特先生的满腔怨恨是正当的，也能证明他对史密斯太太态度非常冷酷、不公正而且没有同情心。","But Mr. Elliot was not done with.Mrs. Smith had been carried away from her first direction, and Anne had forgotten, in the interest of her own family concerns, how much had been originally implied against him; but her attention was now called to the explanation of those first hints, and she listened to a recital which, if it did not perfectly justify the unqualified bitterness of Mrs. Smith, proved him to have been very unfeeling in his conduct towards her; very deficient both in justice and compassion."
"安妮了解到（埃利奥特先生的婚姻并没有损害到他与史密斯夫妇之间的亲密关系）他们还是跟往常一样经常在一起，埃利奥特先生还怂恿他的朋友挥霍远超出其财力许可的程度。史密斯太太不愿意责怪自己，也不忍心责怪自己的丈夫。不过安妮看得出他们的收入从来就不够维持他们阔绰的生活，总的来说他们从一开始就挥霍无度。从他妻子对他的描述中，安妮可以看出史密斯先生感情丰富、性格随和、大大咧咧、没有很强的判断力，但是比他的朋友埃利奥特先生可爱得多，而且与他大不相同，被他牵着鼻子走，可能还受到他的蔑视。埃利奥特先生通过结婚而富裕起来，想要在不使自己的声誉受损的情况下（尽管挥霍无度，但是他已是一位谨慎的人），来满足自己所有的享乐和虚荣心。他开始富起来，正如他朋友应当发现自己在穷下去，可是他似乎根本不关心他朋友的经济能力，相反竭力怂恿他挥霍，结果只能是破产。就这样，史密斯夫妇破产了。","She learned that (the intimacy between them continuing unimpaired by Mr. Elliot’s marriage) they had been as before always together, and Mr. Elliot had led his friend into expenses much beyond his fortune.Mrs. Smith did not want to take blame to herself, and was most tender of throwing any on her husband; but Anne could collect that their income had never been equal to their style of living, and that from the first there had been a great deal of general and joint extravagance.From his wife’s account of him she could discern Mr. Smith to have been a man of warm feelings, easy temper, careless habits, and not strong understanding, much more amiable than his friend, and very unlike him, led by him, and probably despised by him.Mr. Elliot, raised by his marriage to great affluence, and disposed to every gratification of pleasure and vanity which could be commanded without involving himself, (for with all his self-indulgence he had become a prudent man), and beginning to be rich, just as his friend ought to have found himself to be poor, seemed to have had no concern at all for that friend’s probable finances, but, on the contrary, had been prompting and encouraging expenses which could end only in ruin; and the Smiths accordingly had been ruined."
"丈夫死得真是时候，也省得了解事情的全部情况。在这之前他们夫妇也曾想求助于朋友的友谊，但是他们领略够了其中的难处，因而也知道最好不要考验埃利奥特先生的友情。但是直到史密斯先生去世的时候，人们才了解他们的家境败落到了何种程度。史密斯先生出于感情而不是理智上的原因，相信埃利奥特先生对他的敬重，指定他作遗嘱的执行人。但是埃利奥特先生不肯干，他的拒绝给史密斯太太带来了一大堆的困难和痛苦，又加上她当时心情本来就十分悲痛，因而她现在提起来也不能不感到痛苦，而听的人也不能不感到相应的愤怒。","The husband had died just in time to be spared the full knowledge of it.They had previously known embarrassments enough to try the friendship of their friends, and to prove that Mr. Elliot’s had better not be tried; but it was not till his death that the wretched state of his affairs was fully known.With a confidence in Mr. Elliot’s regard, more creditable to his feelings than his judgement, Mr. Smith had appointed him the executor of his will; but Mr. Elliot would not act, and the difficulties and distress which this refusal had heaped on her, in addition to the inevitable sufferings of her situation, had been such as could not be related without anguish of spirit, or listened to without corresponding indignation."
"史密斯太太给安妮看了当时埃利奥特就此事写的几封信，那是他当时对史密斯太太紧急求助的回信，从信中可以看出他决议不肯介入这些无益的麻烦。信中那些冷冰冰的客套话，表明他毫不关心他的态度会给史密斯太太带来多么沉重的打击。这是忘恩负义和毫无人性的可怕写照，安妮刹那间觉得这比罪恶昭彰的公然犯罪更要可恶。安妮听到的事情太多了。过去在她们的谈话中只是隐约提到的一些凄惨场景的细节和一个接一个灾难的细枝末节，现在都很自然地吐露了出来。安妮能够完全理解这种感情上的发泄，只是她对朋友平时那种镇静的心态感到更为惊讶。","Anne was shewn some letters of his on the occasion, answers to urgent applications from Mrs. Smith, which all breathed the same stern resolution of not engaging in a fruitless trouble, and, under a cold civility, the same hard-hearted indifference to any of the evils it might bring on her.It was a dreadful picture of ingratitude and inhumanity; and Anne felt, at some moments, that no flagrant open crime could have been worse.She had a great deal to listen to; all the particulars of past sad scenes, all the minutiae of distress upon distress, which in former conversations had been merely hinted at, were dwelt on now with a natural indulgence.Anne could perfectly comprehend the exquisite relief, and was only the more inclined to wonder at the composure of her friend’s usual state of mind."
"在史密斯太太的一连串抱怨中，有一件事情使安妮感到特别恼火。她有充分的理由相信，她丈夫在西印度群岛有份财产，多年来一直被扣押着，以便偿还本身的债务，只要采取适当的措施，就可能归还给她。这产业虽然不大，但足以使她相对富裕一点。但是没有人去活动。埃利奥特先生什么也不肯做，史密斯夫人本人一方面因为体弱多病而难以奔走，另一方面又没有钱去雇人代劳。她甚至没有可以帮她出出主意的亲戚，又请不起律师。这就使得她手头更为拮据。她以为自己本该生活得好一点，只要适当地花点小力气就能办得到，她担心拖延下去使她要回财产的希望会越来越小，因而心中十分难受。","There was one circumstance in the history of her grievances of particular irritation.She had good reason to believe that some property of her husband in the West Indies, which had been for many years under a sort of sequestration for the payment of its own incumbrances, might be recoverable by proper measures; and this property, though not large, would be enough to make her comparatively rich.But there was nobody to stir in it.Mr. Elliot would do nothing, and she could do nothing herself, equally disabled from personal exertion by her state of bodily weakness, and from employing others by her want of money.She had no natural connexions to assist her even with their counsel, and she could not afford to purchase the assistance of the law.This was a cruel aggravation of actually straitened means.To feel that she ought to be in better circumstances, that a little trouble in the right place might do it, and to fear that delay might be even weakening her claims, was hard to bear."
"正是在这一点上，她本希望安妮做做埃利奥特先生的工作。起初，她以为两人会结婚，曾经担心会因此失去自己的朋友。但是后来她确定埃利奥特先生不会帮她的帮，因为他甚至不知道她在巴斯，便马上想到要是他心爱的女人能施加点影响，还是能帮上她的忙的。于是她曾在尽可能尊重埃利奥特先生人格的前提下设法尽快地引起安妮的兴趣，但是安妮否定了所谓的婚约，这样一来，事情的面貌就变了。这样一来，史密斯太太丧失了这一新产生的希望，无法在她最关心的事情上取得成功。不过她至少能够以自己的方式来讲述整个事情，因而获得一点安慰。","It was on this point that she had hoped to engage Anne’s good offices with Mr. Elliot.She had previously, in the anticipation of their marriage, been very apprehensive of losing her friend by it; but on being assured that he could have made no attempt of that nature, since he did not even know her to be in Bath, it immediately occurred, that something might be done in her favour by the influence of the woman he loved, and she had been hastily preparing to interest Anne’s feelings, as far as the observances due to Mr. Elliot’s character would allow, when Anne’s refutation of the supposed engagement changed the face of everything; and while it took from her the new-formed hope of succeeding in the object of her first anxiety, left her at least the comfort of telling the whole story her own way."
"安妮听了关于埃利奥特先生的这番全面描述之后，不禁对在她们刚开始谈话时史密斯太太对埃利奥特先生的赞扬表示惊讶。“你当时似乎是在推崇和赞扬他啊！”","After listening to this full description of Mr. Elliot, Anne could not but express some surprise at Mrs. Smith’s having spoken of him so favourably in the beginning of their conversation.“She had seemed to recommend and praise him!”"
"“亲爱的，”史密斯太太回答说，“我没有别的办法啊。我以为你必然会嫁给他，尽管他还没有向你求婚，我只能把他当作你丈夫来谈论，怎么能告诉你实情呢。我谈到幸福的字眼时，我的心里在为你流血。不过他聪明而又讨人喜欢，同你这样的女子生活在一起，也不是完全没有希望。他对他第一个妻子非常不好。他们生活在一起很不愉快。不过她十分无知，为人轻浮，不值得尊重，他也从来没有爱过她。我但愿你的命运会好些。”","“My dear,” was Mrs. Smith’s reply, “there was nothing else to be done.I considered your marrying him as certain, though he might not yet have made the offer, and I could no more speak the truth of him, than if he had been your husband.My heart bled for you, as I talked of happiness; and yet he is sensible, he is agreeable, and with such a woman as you, it was not absolutely hopeless.He was very unkind to his first wife.They were wretched together.But she was too ignorant and giddy for respect, and he had never loved her.I was willing to hope that you must fare better.”"
"安妮刚在心里承认有可能被人劝说而嫁给埃利奥特先生，就因想到有可能产生的悲惨结局而感到不寒而栗。她极有可能会听从拉塞尔夫人的劝说。如果是这样，那么等到时间将这一切都暴露出来的时候就已经太晚了，那岂不是非常可悲吗？","Anne could just acknowledge within herself such a possibility of having been induced to marry him, as made her shudder at the idea of the misery which must have followed.It was just possible that she might have been persuaded by Lady Russell!And under such a supposition, which would have been most miserable, when time had disclosed all, too late?"
"不能再让拉塞尔夫人蒙在鼓里了。她们谈了大半个上午，而这次重要谈话得出的一个结论是，安妮完全可以把埃利奥特先生对史密斯太太的所作所为都告诉拉塞尔夫人。","It was very desirable that Lady Russell should be no longer deceived; and one of the concluding arrangements of this important conference, which carried them through the greater part of the morning, was, that Anne had full liberty to communicate to her friend everything relative to Mrs. Smith, in which his conduct was involved."
"第二十二章","CHAPTER 22"
"安妮回到家，仔细想着她所听到的一切。通过对埃利奥特先生的了解，安妮有点感到宽慰。她对这个人再也没有什么温情可言了。他在自身不受欢迎的莽撞方面与温特沃思上校恰好相反。安妮一想到昨天晚上他居心不良的大献殷勤和他可能已经造成的无法弥补的灾祸，就感到无比气愤，但是头脑还是清醒的。她对他的怜悯已经消失。不过，这是唯一让她感到宽慰的地方。在其他方面，她看看四周或展望未来，发现还有更多值得怀疑和忧虑的地方。她担心拉塞尔夫人会感到失望与痛苦；担心她的父亲和姐姐会蒙受屈辱，她痛苦地预见很多不幸的后果，但是不知道如何避开哪怕是其中的一种。她非常庆幸自己看清了埃利奥特先生。她从未想到自己会因为没有怠慢史密斯太太这样的老朋友而得到报答，可这一报答却自然而然地出现了！史密斯太太能把别人不会告知她的情况全都告诉了他。这些情况能不能告诉她的家人呢？但现在这只不过是想想罢了。她必须同拉塞尔夫人谈谈，把情况告诉她，与她商量商量，然后尽她自己最大的努力静观事态的发展。毕竟她最需要镇静的是不能向拉塞尔夫人提起那桩心事。在这方面只能完全由她一个人承担焦虑和担忧。","Anne went home to think over all that she had heard.In one point, her feelings were relieved by this knowledge of Mr. Elliot.There was no longer anything of tenderness due to him.He stood as opposed to Captain Wentworth, in all his own unwelcome obtrusiveness; and the evil of his attentions last night, the irremediable mischief he might have done, was considered with sensations unqualified, unperplexed.Pity for him was all over.But this was the only point of relief.In every other respect, in looking around her, or penetrating forward, she saw more to distrust and to apprehend.She was concerned for the disappointment and pain Lady Russell would be feeling; for the mortifications which must be hanging over her father and sister, and had all the distress of foreseeing many evils, without knowing how to avert any one of them.She was most thankful for her own knowledge of him.She had never considered herself as entitled to reward for not slighting an old friend like Mrs. Smith, but here was a reward indeed springing from it!Mrs. Smith had been able to tell her what no one else could have done.Could the knowledge have been extended through her family?But this was a vain idea.She must talk to Lady Russell, tell her, consult with her, and having done her best, wait the event with as much composure as possible; and after all, her greatest want of composure would be in that quarter of the mind which could not be opened to Lady Russell; in that flow of anxieties and fears which must be all to herself."
"回到家里，她发现她如愿以偿地避开了埃利奥特先生。因为今天上午他确实来拜访过他们，而且坐了很长时间。安妮刚刚在暗自庆幸，觉得放心了，却又听说他晚上又要过来。","She found, on reaching home, that she had, as she intended, escaped seeing Mr. Elliot; that he had called and paid them a long morning visit; but hardly had she congratulated herself, and felt safe, when she heard that he was coming again in the evening."
"“我一点儿也不想请他来，”伊丽莎白装作漫不经心地说，“但是他给了那么多暗示。至少克莱太太是这么说的。”","“I had not the smallest intention of asking him,” said Elizabeth, with affected carelessness, “but he gave so many hints; so Mrs. Clay says, at least.”"
"“真的，我真是那样说的。我一生中没有见到还有人这么渴望得到别人邀请。可怜的人！我真为他感到难过。因为你狠心的姐姐看起来如此冷酷无情。”","“Indeed, I do say it.I never saw anybody in my life spell harder for an invitation.Poor man!I was really in pain for him; for your hard-hearted sister, Miss Anne, seems bent on cruelty.”"
"“哦！”伊丽莎白嚷道，“这种把戏我看得多了，不会一下子被一位绅士的暗示搞得不知所措的。不过，我发现他为今天上午没有见到我父亲而感到非常遗憾时，我就马上让步了，因为我确实不想错失一个让他和沃尔特爵士在一起的机会。看起来他们在一起是大有益处的。两个人的举止都那么优雅。埃利奥特先生是多么毕恭毕敬地仰视父亲。”","“Oh!” cried Elizabeth, “I have been rather too much used to the game to be soon overcome by a gentleman’s hints.However, when I found how excessively he was regretting that he should miss my father this morning, I gave way immediately, for I would never really omit an opportunity of bring him and Sir Walter together.They appear to so much advantage in company with each other.Each behaving so pleasantly.Mr. Elliot looking up with so much respect.”"
"“太令人高兴了！”克莱太太嘴里虽在喊，但是却不敢朝安妮望上一眼。“真像一对父子！亲爱的埃利奥特小姐，我可以说他们像一对父子吗？”","“Quite delightful!” cried Mrs. Clay, not daring, however, to turn her eyes towards Anne.“Exactly like father and son!Dear Miss Elliot, may I not say father and son?”"
"“啊！我没有禁止任何人说话。你愿意这么想就这么想吧！不过，说实话，我并不觉得他的殷勤超过了其他人。”","“Oh!I lay no embargo on any body’s words.If you will have such ideas!But, upon my word, I am scarcely sensible of his attentions being beyond those of other men.”"
"“我亲爱的埃利奥特小姐！”克莱太太高声嚷道，举起双手，翻起双眼，把她剩下的惊叹淹没在一阵适宜的沉默之中。","“My dear Miss Elliot!” exclaimed Mrs. Clay, lifting her hands and eyes, and sinking all the rest of her astonishment in a convenient silence."
"“好啦，我亲爱的佩内洛普，你不用对他这么大惊小怪。你知道，我的确邀请了他。我带着微笑把他送走了。当我发现他明天的确一整天要去桑贝里庄园见朋友，我就对他发了善心。”","“Well, my dear Penelope, you need not be so alarmed about him.I did invite him, you know.I sent him away with smiles.When I found he was really going to his friends at Thornberry Park for the whole day to-morrow, I had compassion on him.”"
"安妮很佩服克莱太太的高超演技，她居然能对那个实际上必然会妨碍她实现主要目标的人的期待和到来，表现得如此愉快。克莱太太不可能不讨厌见到埃利奥特先生，可她却能装出一副彬彬有礼、心平气和的神情，看来她同沃尔特爵士在一起的时间减少到一半，她倒很满意。","Anne admired the good acting of the friend, in being able to shew such pleasure as she did, in the expectation and in the actual arrival of the very person whose presence must really be interfering with her prime object.It was impossible but that Mrs. Clay must hate the sight of Mr. Elliot; and yet she could assume a most obliging, placid look, and appear quite satisfied with the curtailed license of devoting herself only half as much to Sir Walter as she would have done otherwise."
"对于安妮本人来说，一看到埃利奥特先生本人进屋，她就非常不快。再看到他走过来同自己讲话，更是感到痛苦。她以前也常常觉得埃利奥特先生不可能总是这么真诚，但是现在她发现他处处不真诚。他对她父亲的殷勤和尊重与他以前的话语对照起来，简直令人作呕。一想起他对史密斯太太的无情无义，安妮几乎没法看他现在的这副笑脸和温情，没法听他那些假仁假义的言论。","To Anne herself it was most distressing to see Mr. Elliot enter the room; and quite painful to have him approach and speak to her.She had been used before to feel that he could not be always quite sincere, but now she saw insincerity in everything.His attentive deference to her father, contrasted with his former language, was odious; and when she thought of his cruel conduct towards Mrs. Smith, she could hardly bear the sight of his present smiles and mildness, or the sound of his artificial good sentiments."
"安妮决定在态度上不要变化得太突然，以免引起他的异议。她的主要目标是避开他的种种询问或对她进行奉承。但是她只想在彼此关系允许的范围内对他冷淡，而且要尽量不动声色地从前一阵逐步发展起来的不必要的亲密关系中摆脱出来。因此，她比头天晚上更加谨慎与冷漠。","She meant to avoid any such alteration of manners as might provoke a remonstrance on his side.It was a great object to her to escape all enquiry or eclat; but it was her intention to be as decidedly cool to him as might be compatible with their relationship; and to retrace, as quietly as she could, the few steps of unnecessary intimacy she had been gradually led along.She was accordingly more guarded, and more cool, than she had been the night before."
"埃利奥特先生想再次激发安妮的好奇心，使她急于了解他过去是如何以及从哪儿听别人赞扬她的，他非常希望再一次听到安妮的恳求，但是这一法宝不灵了。他觉得必须有社交场合的热烈和动人的气氛，才能燃起他这位谦逊的堂妹的虚荣心。他觉得至少在眼下其他人都非常需要他去应酬时，他要是冒险去做这样的尝试是不行的。他没有想到，现在这个话题对他已经十分不利，因为一提这事，安妮马上就联想到他那些最不能宽恕的言行。","He wanted to animate her curiosity again as to how and where he could have heard her formerly praised; wanted very much to be gratified by more solicitation; but the charm was broken: he found that the heat and animation of a public room was necessary to kindle his modest cousin’s vanity; he found, at least, that it was not to be done now, by any of those attempts which he could hazard among the too-commanding claims of the others.He little surmised that it was a subject acting now exactly against his interest, bringing immediately to her thoughts all those parts of his conduct which were least excusable."
"安妮发现埃利奥特先生明天早晨一早确实要离开巴斯，而且一去就是两天多，总算比较满意。他回来的那天晚上还要应邀来卡姆登，不过从周四到周六晚上他是肯定不会来了。安妮眼前总是有个克莱太太已经够让人讨厌的了，再加上这么个更虚伪的伪君子，就把那么点宁静感和舒适感都破坏无遗了。一想到这些人在不断地欺骗她的姐姐和父亲，一想到父亲和姐姐将面临的种种屈辱，安妮就感到非常羞愧！克莱太太的自私心理不像埃利奥特先生那么复杂，也不那么令人恶心。安妮宁愿马上对克莱太太同父亲的婚姻妥协，哪怕它会带来各种不幸，也要阻止埃利奥特先生尽力为防止这桩婚事而施展的诡计。","She had some satisfaction in finding that he was really going out of Bath the next morning, going early, and that he would be gone the greater part of two days.He was invited again to Camden Place the very evening of his return; but from Thursday to Saturday evening his absence was certain.It was bad enough that a Mrs. Clay should be always before her; but that a deeper hypocrite should be added to their party, seemed the destruction of everything like peace and comfort.It was so humiliating to reflect on the constant deception practised on her father and Elizabeth; to consider the various sources of mortification preparing for them!Mrs. Clay’s selfishness was not so complicate nor so revolting as his; and Anne would have compounded for the marriage at once, with all its evils, to be clear of Mr. Elliot’s subtleties in endeavouring to prevent it."
"星期五的早晨，安妮打算一早就去拉塞尔夫人家，把那些要紧的事情告诉她。她本想一吃过早饭就动身，但是克莱太太为了讨好伊丽莎白，也要出去替她办事。于是安妮决定等一会儿再走，免得跟她结伴同行。因此，等她看到克莱太太走远了以后，她才说上午要去里弗斯街。","On Friday morning she meant to go very early to Lady Russell, and accomplish the necessary communication; and she would have gone directly after breakfast, but that Mrs. Clay was also going out on some obliging purpose of saving her sister trouble, which determined her to wait till she might be safe from such a companion.She saw Mrs. Clay fairly off, therefore, before she began to talk of spending the morning in Rivers Street."
"“很好，”伊丽莎白说道，“我没有什么东西好送去的，就代我问声好吧。啊！你不妨把她偏要借给我的那本讨厌的书带回去，就假装说我已经看完了。我的确不能总是自寻烦恼地看些新版的诗集和议论国家大事的书籍。拉塞尔夫人总是拿些新书来烦我。这话你不必告诉她，不过我觉得她那天晚上穿得真难看。我过去一直以为她穿衣服的品味很高雅，但是那天在音乐会上，我真为她感到害臊。她一副一本正经而又做作的神情，而且坐得那么笔直！当然请替我转达对她最亲切的问候。”","“Very well,” said Elizabeth, “I have nothing to send but my love.Oh! you may as well take back that tiresome book she would lend me, and pretend I have read it through.I really cannot be plaguing myself for ever with all the new poems and states of the nation that come out.Lady Russell quite bores one with her new publications.You need not tell her so, but I thought her dress hideous the other night.I used to think she had some taste in dress, but I was ashamed of her at the concert.Something so formal and arrange in her air!and she sits so upright!My best love, of course.”"
"“也带我问好，”沃尔特爵士接着说道，“最亲切的问候。你就告诉她，说我打算不久就去拜访她。话说得客气点，我只不过想去留一下名片。上午去拜访她那样的女人是不恰当的，因为这时候她还没怎么打扮。她只要略施脂粉，就不怕让人看见了。不过我上次去拜访的时候，我注意到她马上放下了窗帘。”","“And mine,” added Sir Walter.“Kindest regards.And you may say, that I mean to call upon her soon.Make a civil message; but I shall only leave my card.Morning visits are never fair by women at her time of life, who make themselves up so little.If she would only wear rouge she would not be afraid of being seen; but last time I called, I observed the blinds were let down immediately.”"
"正当她父亲说话的时候，有人敲门。会是谁呢？安妮想起埃利奥特先生事先说过他随时可能来访，如果不是知道他在七英里以外的地方赴约，安妮还会以为是他呢。大家像往常一样琢磨了一阵后，便听到了一阵像往常一样的脚步声，“查尔斯•马斯格罗夫先生和太太”便被引进了屋。","While her father spoke, there was a knock at the door.Who could it be?Anne, remembering the preconcerted visits, at all hours, of Mr. Elliot, would have expected him, but for his known engagement seven miles off.After the usual period of suspense, the usual sounds of approach were heard, and “Mr. and Mrs. Charles Musgrove” were ushered into the room."
"他们的出现引起了极强烈的震惊，但是安妮见到他们确实非常高兴。另外两位也不感到十分遗憾，也就摆出合乎礼节的欢迎姿态。等到弄清楚这两位亲家并不打算来此居住时，沃尔特爵士和伊丽莎白顿时热忱大增，并表示要竭力地尽主人之谊。他们陪马斯格罗夫太太来巴斯小住几天，住在白哈特旅馆。大家很快把这些事情弄清楚了。后来沃尔特爵士和伊丽莎白把玛丽领到另一间客厅，高兴地听着她的赞美之词，安妮才从查尔斯那儿得知了他们来巴斯的真实情况，解释一下玛丽刚才做出的那些故弄玄虚而又自鸣得意的暗示，还有他们到底来了哪些人这个显得十分混乱的问题。","Surprise was the strongest emotion raised by their appearance; but Anne was really glad to see them; and the others were not so sorry but that they could put on a decent air of welcome; and as soon as it became clear that these, their nearest relations, were not arrived with an views of accommodation in that house, Sir Walter and Elizabeth were able to rise in cordiality, and do the honours of it very well.They were come to Bath for a few days with Mrs. Musgrove, and were at the White Hart.So much was pretty soon understood; but till Sir Walter and Elizabeth were walking Mary into the other drawing-room, and regaling themselves with her admiration, Anne could not draw upon Charles’s brain for a regular history of their coming, or an explanation of some smiling hints of particular business, which had been ostentatiously dropped by Mary, as well as of some apparent confusion as to whom their party consisted of."
"安妮这才知道，他们一行除了查尔斯夫妇之外，还有马斯格罗夫太太、亨里埃塔和哈维尔上校。查尔斯清楚地谈了事情的原委，安妮从他的叙述中发现这事的发展过程颇为特别。这件事情最先是由哈维尔上校引起的，他想来巴斯办点事情。他早在一个星期之前就开始提起这事了。由于狩猎时节已过，查尔斯想找点事做，便提议要跟他一块来，而且哈维尔太太看来非常赞成，觉得对她丈夫有好处。但是玛丽不肯一个人留下来，对这件事情大为不快，所以有一两天事情似乎悬而未决，或者几乎要告吹了。但是后来，查尔斯的父亲和母亲采纳了这个想法。他母亲在巴斯有几位好朋友，很想去看看。而大家也认为对亨里埃塔来说，这是一个为她自己和妹妹置办结婚礼服的好机会。总之大家最后都成了他母亲的随行人员，哈维尔上校便舒服和安心多了。而为了大家方便些，他和玛丽也来了。他们是头天深夜到达的。哈维尔太太、她的孩子们和本威克舰长，同马斯格罗夫先生和路易莎一起留在阿珀克罗斯。","She then found that it consisted of Mrs. Musgrove, Henrietta, and Captain Harville, beside their two selves.He gave her a very plain, intelligible account of the whole; a narration in which she saw a great deal of most characteristic proceeding.The scheme had received its first impulse by Captain Harville’s wanting to come to Bath on business.He had begun to talk of it a week ago; and by way of doing something, as shooting was over, Charles had proposed coming with him, and Mrs. Harville had seemed to like the idea of it very much, as an advantage to her husband; but Mary could not bear to be left, and had made herself so unhappy about it, that for a day or two everything seemed to be in suspense, or at an end.But then, it had been taken up by his father and mother.His mother had some old friends in Bath whom she wanted to see; it was thought a good opportunity for Henrietta to come and buy wedding-clothes for herself and her sister; and, in short, it ended in being his mother’s party, that everything might be comfortable and easy to Captain Harville; and he and Mary were included in it by way of general convenience.They had arrived late the night before.Mrs. Harville, her children, and Captain Benwick, remained with Mr. Musgrove and Louisa at Uppercross."
"安妮唯一感到吃惊的是，事情发展得如此迅速，竟然已经到了谈论亨里埃塔结婚礼服的时候。她原以为他们经济上有很大的困难，一时还结不了婚。可是她从查尔斯那里得知，不久以前，（玛丽上次给她写信之后），查尔斯•海特应一个朋友邀请，为一名在多年后才能享受继承权的少年管理财产。凭着这份收入，加上在管理期限结束前查尔斯•海特几乎肯定可以获得一笔更为长期的收入，因此两家同意了这对年轻人的愿望，因此他们的婚礼可能同路易莎的一样来得快，在几个月内就要举行。“那可真是个美差，”查尔斯补充道，“离阿珀克罗斯只不过二十五英里，在一个美丽的乡村，是多塞特郡的一个很美的地方。它位于国王一些最好的狩猎保护区的中心，周围有三个大业主，他们一个比一个谨慎戒备。查尔斯•海特可以弄到专门的拜访信去拜访至少其中的两个。但他对此没有给予应有的重视，”默斯格罗夫说，“查尔斯对运动根本不感兴趣。这就是他最大的缺点。”","Anne’s only surprise was, that affairs should be in forwardness enough for Henrietta’s wedding-clothes to be talked of.She had imagined such difficulties of fortune to exist there as must prevent the marriage from being near at hand; but she learned from Charles that, very recently, (since Mary’s last letter to herself), Charles Hayter had been applied to by a friend to hold a living for a youth who could not possibly claim it under many years; and that on the strength of his present income, with almost a certainty of something more permanent long before the term in question, the two families had consented to the young people’s wishes, and that their marriage was likely to take place in a few months, quite as soon as Louisa’s.“And a very good living it was,” Charles added: “only five-and-twenty miles from Uppercross, and in a very fine country: fine part of Dorsetshire.In the centre of some of the best preserves in the kingdom, surrounded by three great proprietors, each more careful and jealous than the other; and to two of the three at least, Charles Hayter might get a special recommendation.Not that he will value it as he ought,” he observed, “Charles is too cool about sporting.That’s the worst of him.”"
"“我真的非常高兴，”安妮大声说道，“能有这种事真让我特别高兴。她们两姐妹应该同样得到幸福，她们的关系一向很好，一个人的光辉前景不应该给另一个人的未来生活带来暗淡的色彩——她们应该拥有同样幸福而舒适的生活。我希望你父母对这两门婚事都很满意。”","“I am extremely glad, indeed,” cried Anne, “particularly glad that this should happen; and that of two sisters, who both deserve equally well, and who have always been such good friends, the pleasant prospect of one should not be dimming those of the other—that they should be so equal in their prosperity and comfort.I hope your father and mother are quite happy with regard to both.”"
"“哦！是的。要是这两位女婿再富裕一点，我父亲会更高兴的，不过他也没有别的什么可挑剔的。钱，你知道，这可得花钱了——一下子嫁两个女儿——这不可能是一件轻而易举的事，这使他在很多事情上变得拮据。不过我并不是说做女儿的没有权利得到钱。她们理当得到女儿的那一份。而且我可以肯定地说，父亲对我一向非常仁慈和大方。玛丽不大喜欢亨里埃塔的婚事。你知道，她一向如此。但是，她小看了查尔斯•海特，也对温思罗普庄园估计不够。我无法使她理解这宗产业的价值。随着时间的推移，这会是一桩很般配的婚事。我一向喜欢查尔斯•海特，现在我也不会改变自己的看法的。”","“Oh! yes. My father would be well pleased if the gentlemen were richer, but he has no other fault to find.Money, you know, coming down with money—two daughters at once—it cannot be a very agreeable operation, and it streightens him as to many things.However, I do not mean to say they have not a right to it.It is very fit they should have daughters’ shares; and I am sure he has always been a very kind, liberal father to me.Mary does not above half like Henrietta’s match.She never did, you know.But she does not do him justice, nor think enough about Winthrop.I cannot make her attend to the value of the property.It is a very fair match, as times go; and I have liked Charles Hayter all my life, and I shall not leave off now.”"
"“像马斯格罗夫先生和太太这样优秀的父母，”安妮说道，“会为他们女儿的婚事感到高兴的。我想他们在尽一切力量为他们的子女创造幸福。在他们的影响下，年轻人是多么幸福！你父母好像根本没有那种会把老少两辈引入歧途和痛苦的不切实际的奢望。我想你们觉得路易莎现在已经完全复原了吧？”","“Such excellent parents as Mr. and Mrs. Musgrove,” exclaimed Anne, “should be happy in their children’s marriages.They do everything to confer happiness, I am sure.What a blessing to young people to be in such hands!Your father and mother seem so totally free from all those ambitious feelings which have led to so much misconduct and misery, both in young and old.I hope you think Louisa perfectly recovered now?”"
"查尔斯犹犹豫豫地说：“是的，我想是这样。她好多了，但是却变了。她不跑也不跳，不笑也不跳舞，跟以前完全不一样了。要是门关的声音响一些，她就会吓一跳，像小鸟掉在水里似的扑腾。本威克整天坐在她的身边，给她读诗，或者在她耳边窃窃私语。","He answered rather hesitatingly, “Yes, I believe I do; very much recovered; but she is altered; there is no running or jumping about, no laughing or dancing; it is quite different.If one happens only to shut the door a little hard, she starts and wriggles like a young dab-chick in the water; and Benwick sits at her elbow, reading verses, or whispering to her, all day long.”"
"安妮忍不住笑了。“我知道这不合你的意，”安妮说道，“不过，我确实相信他是一位优秀的年轻人。”","Anne could not help laughing.“That cannot be much to your taste, I know,” said she; “but I do believe him to be an excellent young man.”"
"“他当然优秀。没人会怀疑这一点。我想你不会以为我气量如此狭窄，要求每个人都有跟我一样的追求和乐趣。我十分看重本威克，只要有人能让他开口说话，他就会滔滔不绝。读书对他没有害处，因为他既读书又打仗。他是个勇敢的小伙子。上个周一，我对他有了更多的了解。那天上午，我们在我父亲的大谷仓里开展了一场精彩的逮鼠大战。他干得非常出色，从此我更加喜欢他了。”","“To be sure he is.Nobody doubts it; and I hope you do not think I am so illiberal as to want every man to have the same objects and pleasures as myself.I have a great value for Benwick; and when one can but get him to talk, he has plenty to say.His reading has done him no harm, for he has fought as well as read.He is a brave fellow.I got more acquainted with him last Monday than ever I did before.We had a famous set-to at rat-hunting all the morning in my father’s great barns; and he played his part so well that I have liked him the better ever since.”"
"说到这里，他们的谈话被打断了，因为查尔斯不得不跟着其他人去欣赏镜子与瓷器了。不过安妮听到的一切，足以使她了解阿珀克罗斯的现状，也对那里的喜事感到高兴。然而高兴之余，她又叹了一口气，但是她的叹气声中丝毫没有嫉妒的意思。如果可能，她当然愿意像他们那样幸福，但是她不想损害他们的幸福。","Here they were interrupted by the absolute necessity of Charles’s following the others to admire mirrors and china; but Anne had heard enough to understand the present state of Uppercross, and rejoice in its happiness; and though she sighed as she rejoiced, her sigh had none of the ill-will of envy in it.She would certainly have risen to their blessings if she could, but she did not want to lessen theirs."
"总之，这次拜访是在愉快的气氛中度过的。玛丽兴致很高，喜欢这种快乐的气氛和换换环境。这次出门，她乘坐的是婆婆家的驷马马车，又完全不依赖娘家，因此感到非常满意。于是她完全有情绪来欣赏一切她理应欣赏的东西，而且当他们把这房子的优越性详细地介绍给她的时候，她也欣然地应承几句。她对父亲和姐姐没有什么要求，他们那漂亮的客厅也给她脸上添足了光彩。","The visit passed off altogether in high good humour.Mary was in excellent spirits, enjoying the gaiety and the change, and so well satisfied with the journey in her mother-in-law’s carriage with four horses, and with her own complete independence of Camden Place, that she was exactly in a temper to admire everything as she ought, and enter most readily into all the superiorities of the house, as they were detailed to her.She had no demands on her father or sister, and her consequence was just enough increased by their handsome drawing-rooms."
"伊丽莎白一时之间感到十分难受。她觉得应该邀请马斯格罗夫太太和其随行人来共进晚餐，但是家里换了风格，减少了佣人，这样的晚餐势必会露馅，而让那些身份比凯林奇的埃利奥特家族低的人看出来，真叫伊丽莎白难以忍受。这是礼仪与虚荣之间的斗争，但是虚荣占了上风，于是伊丽莎白又高兴起来了。她内心里这样说服自己：“那是陈腐的观念，乡下人好客，但是我们不请人吃饭，在巴斯没有人这样做。艾丽西亚夫人从不请客，甚至自己亲妹妹一家已经在这里住了一个月，她也没有请过他们。而且我敢说这对于马斯格罗夫太太也不方便，会打乱她的安排。我敢肯定，她宁愿不来，她跟我们在一起会不自在的。我想请他们来参加一次晚会，这样会更好，更新奇也更有趣。他们以前还从没见过这样的两间客厅。他们明天晚上会很乐意过来的。那会是一次正式的晚会，规模很小，但是却非常讲究。”伊丽莎白对此感到满意，当她当场向玛丽和查尔斯发出邀请，并许诺要邀请其他人时，玛丽同样心满意足。她还特意要求玛丽见见埃利奥特先生，并要把她引荐给达尔林普尔夫人和卡特雷特小姐，而幸运的是，她们答应要来。玛丽还没有受到过这样令人感激的招待。埃利奥特小姐当天上午将荣幸地去拜访马斯格罗夫太太，而安妮直接就跟查尔斯和玛丽去看望她和亨里埃塔了。","Elizabeth was, for a short time, suffering a good deal.She felt that Mrs. Musgrove and all her party ought to be asked to dine with them; but she could not bear to have the difference of style, the reduction of servants, which a dinner must betray, witnessed by those who had been always so inferior to the Elliots of Kellynch.It was a struggle between propriety and vanity; but vanity got the better, and then Elizabeth was happy again.These were her internal persuasions: “Old fashioned notions; country hospitality; we do not profess to give dinners; few people in Bath do; Lady Alicia never does; did not even ask her own sister’s family, though they were here a month: and I dare say it would be very inconvenient to Mrs. Musgrove; put her quite out of her way.I am sure she would rather not come; she cannot feel easy with us.I will ask them all for an evening; that will be much better; that will be a novelty and a treat.They have not seen two such drawing rooms before.They will be delighted to come to-morrow evening.It shall be a regular party, small, but most elegant.”And this satisfied Elizabeth: and when the invitation was given to the two present, and promised for the absent, Mary was as completely satisfied.She was particularly asked to meet Mr. Elliot, and be introduced to Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret, who were fortunately already engaged to come; and she could not have received a more gratifying attention.Miss Elliot was to have the honour of calling on Mrs. Musgrove in the course of the morning; and Anne walked off with Charles and Mary, to go and see her and Henrietta directly."
"她本想同拉塞尔夫人谈谈的，但是眼下只能放弃这个计划。他们三个一起到里弗斯街呆了几分钟，安妮心想，把原本想讲的话推迟一天也没关系，于是便匆匆赶往白哈特旅馆去看望她的旧友和去年秋天的伙伴们，通过多次的接触，她对他们怀有炽热的友情。","Her plan of sitting with Lady Russell must give way for the present.They all three called in Rivers Street for a couple of minutes; but Anne convinced herself that a day’s delay of the intended communication could be of no consequence, and hastened forward to the White Hart, to see again the friends and companions of the last autumn, with an eagerness of good-will which many associations contributed to form."
"他们在屋里见到了马斯格罗夫太太和她的女儿，而且只有她们母女俩，安妮受到了她们的热情款待。亨里埃塔因为最近有了喜事，内心充满了新鲜的幸福感，因此对原来就喜欢的每一个人都充满了关心和兴趣。马斯格罗夫太太之所以对安妮这么真诚，是因为安妮在她们困难时曾经帮助过她们。安妮更加喜欢这发自内心的、热情而真挚的招待，因为令人伤心的是，她在家里享受不到这种幸福。她们恳求安妮尽量多地同她们呆在一起，请她天天过来，整天呆在这里，简直要把她当作家庭的一员。作为回报，安妮自然同往常一样关心和帮助她们。查尔斯走了以后，安妮便听马斯格罗夫太太谈起了路易莎的境况，听亨里埃塔谈自己的情况，并就某些事情谈了自己的意见，还介绍了一些商店的情况。在安妮需要帮助时，她还要停下谈话给她帮忙，从给她换绸带到算账、给她找钥匙、整理小饰物，还要设法使她相信没有人亏待她。玛丽坐在窗口前，俯瞰着矿泉厅的入口，同往常一样感到很有趣，但是仍不免想到自己受到了别人的亏待。","They found Mrs. Musgrove and her daughter within, and by themselves, and Anne had the kindest welcome from each.Henrietta was exactly in that state of recently-improved views, of fresh-formed happiness, which made her full of regard and interest for everybody she had ever liked before at all; and Mrs. Musgrove’s real affection had been won by her usefulness when they were in distress.It was a heartiness, and a warmth, and a sincerity which Anne delighted in the more, from the sad want of such blessings at home.She was entreated to give them as much of her time as possible, invited for every day and all day long, or rather claimed as part of the family; and, in return, she naturally fell into all her wonted ways of attention and assistance, and on Charles’s leaving them together, was listening to Mrs. Musgrove’s history of Louisa, and to Henrietta’s of herself, giving opinions on business, and recommendations to shops; with intervals of every help which Mary required, from altering her ribbon to settling her accounts; from finding her keys, and assorting her trinkets, to trying to convince her that she was not ill-used by anybody; which Mary, well amused as she generally was, in her station at a window overlooking the entrance to the Pump Room, could not but have her moments of imagining."
"这个上午必然十分混乱。一大家人住在一个旅馆里，一定会出现变化多端的不安定局面。隔五分钟就会收到一张便条，再隔五分钟就是一个包裹。安妮在那儿呆了不到半个小时，他们那间宽敞的餐厅似乎就坐满了一半。一群忠实的老朋友坐在马斯格罗夫太太四周，查尔斯带着哈维尔上校和温特沃思上校回来了。温特沃思上校的出现只不过使安妮惊讶了片刻。安妮不可能如此健忘，竟想不到他们共同好友的到来会很快又把他们俩人带到了一起。他们之间的最后一次非常重要的谈话打开了他感情的闸门，安妮从中得出了一个可喜的结论。但是从他的表情看来，安妮又有点担心，觉得他还抱着曾促使他匆匆离开音乐会的那种不幸的念头。看样子他并不想走到安妮跟前来同她交谈。","A morning of thorough confusion was to be expected.A large party in an hotel ensured a quick-changing, unsettled scene.One five minutes brought a note, the next a parcel; and Anne had not been there half an hour, when their dining-room, spacious as it was, seemed more than half filled: a party of steady old friends were seated around Mrs. Musgrove, and Charles came back with Captains Harville and Wentworth.The appearance of the latter could not be more than the surprise of the moment.It was impossible for her to have forgotten to feel that this arrival of their common friends must be soon bringing them together again.Their last meeting had been most important in opening his feelings; she had derived from it a delightful conviction; but she feared from his looks, that the same unfortunate persuasion, which had hastened him away from the Concert Room, still governed.He did not seem to want to be near enough for conversation."
"安妮尽力保持镇定，让事情顺其自然，她竭力想往合乎情理的方面想：“当然，如果我们双方的感情依旧的话，那么我们不久就会了解对方。我们不是小孩子了，不会无理取闹了，不会由于一时的冲突而误入歧途，也不会不负责任地把自己的幸福当儿戏。”然而，过了一会儿，安妮觉得在目前的情况下，他们呆在一起似乎只能使他们陷于极为有害的疏忽和误解。","She tried to be calm, and leave things to take their course, and tried to dwell much on this argument of rational dependence:—“Surely, if there be constant attachment on each side, our hearts must understand each other ere long.We are not boy and girl, to be captiously irritable, misled by every moment’s inadvertence, and wantonly playing with our own happiness.”And yet, a few minutes afterwards, she felt as if their being in company with each other, under their present circumstances, could only be exposing them to inadvertencies and misconstructions of the most mischievous kind."
"“安妮，”玛丽仍然站在窗口喊道，“我敢肯定站在柱廊底下的是克莱太太，还有个男的跟她在一起。我看见他们刚从巴斯街转弯过来。他们好像谈得很火热。那是谁呢？过来告诉我。天哪！我想起来了。是埃利奥特先生。”","“Anne,” cried Mary, still at her window, “there is Mrs. Clay, I am sure, standing under the colonnade, and a gentleman with her.I saw them turn the corner from Bath Street just now.They seemed deep in talk.Who is it?Come, and tell me.Good heavens!I recollect.It is Mr. Elliot himself.”"
"“不，”安妮大喊道，“我向你保证，不可能是埃利奥特先生。他今天上午九点刚刚离开巴斯，直到明天才回来。”","“No,” cried Anne, quickly, “it cannot be Mr. Elliot, I assure you.He was to leave Bath at nine this morning, and does not come back till to-morrow.”"
"她说话的时候，觉得温特沃思上校在看她，这种感觉使她既苦恼又尴尬，让她怀疑自己说得太多了，尽管话很简单。","As she spoke, she felt that Captain Wentworth was looking at her, the consciousness of which vexed and embarrassed her, and made her regret that she had said so much, simple as it was."
"玛丽最气愤别人认为她不了解自己的堂兄，便十分激动地谈起了自己家族的相貌特征，越发肯定那就是埃利奥特先生，再一次叫安妮自己过去看看，但是安妮根本就没想动，尽量表现出冷淡和漠不关心的样子。然而一看到两三位女客相互笑了笑，会意地交换眼神，仿佛她们很了解其中的奥妙似的，安妮就又感到苦恼。显然关于她的某种流言已经传播开来了。接下来大家沉默了一会儿，似乎要确保这流言会传得更广。","Mary, resenting that she should be supposed not to know her own cousin, began talking very warmly about the family features, and protesting still more positively that it was Mr. Elliot, calling again upon Anne to come and look for herself, but Anne did not mean to stir, and tried to be cool and unconcerned.Her distress returned, however, on perceiving smiles and intelligent glances pass between two or three of the lady visitors, as if they believed themselves quite in the secret.It was evident that the report concerning her had spread, and a short pause succeeded, which seemed to ensure that it would now spread farther."
"“快来呀，安妮，”玛丽嚷道，“你自己过来看看。你再不过来就来不及了。他们要分别了，他们正在握手。他转身了。难道我不认识埃利奥特先生！你好像把在莱姆的事情全忘了。”","“Do come, Anne” cried Mary, “come and look yourself.You will be too late if you do not make haste.They are parting; they are shaking hands.He is turning away.Not know Mr. Elliot, indeed!You seem to have forgot all about Lyme.”"
"为了让玛丽平息下来，也许是为了掩饰自己的尴尬，安妮平静地走到了窗口前。她来得正是时候，看清了那确实是埃利奥特先生，这在刚才她还一直不肯相信呢。他朝一边走不见了，而克莱太太则快步朝另一个方向走掉了。安妮看到这两个有着完全对立的利益关系的人居然会有一副友好商谈的样子，她不得不感到吃惊，但她压制住自己的惊讶，平静地说道：“是的，那确实是埃利奥特先生。我想他改变了他的出发时间，如此而已，或者是我自己弄错了，我可能没有听清楚。”说完回到自己的座位，镇静下来，心想自己对这件事情的处理还不错，不禁有些欣慰。","To pacify Mary, and perhaps screen her own embarrassment, Anne did move quietly to the window.She was just in time to ascertain that it really was Mr. Elliot, which she had never believed, before he disappeared on one side, as Mrs. Clay walked quickly off on the other; and checking the surprise which she could not but feel at such an appearance of friendly conference between two persons of totally opposite interest, she calmly said, “Yes, it is Mr. Elliot, certainly.He has changed his hour of going, I suppose, that is all, or I may be mistaken, I might not attend;” and walked back to her chair, recomposed, and with the comfortable hope of having acquitted herself well."
"客人们都告辞了，查尔斯客气地将他们送走后，在他们身后做了个鬼脸，责备他们不该来，开始说道：","The visitors took their leave; and Charles, having civilly seen them off, and then made a face at them, and abused them for coming, began with—"
"“好了，妈妈，我为你做了件你会喜欢的事情。我到戏院去了一趟，订了明晚的包厢。我是个好儿子吧？我知道你喜欢看戏，那个包厢可以坐下我们大家。它能容纳九个人。我已经约好了温特沃思上校。我想安妮也会愿意跟我们一起去的。我们大家都喜欢看戏。我干得不错吧，妈妈？”","“Well, mother, I have done something for you that you will like.I have been to the theatre, and secured a box for to-morrow night.A’n’t I a good boy?I know you love a play; and there is room for us all.It holds nine.I have engaged Captain Wentworth.Anne will not be sorry to join us, I am sure.We all like a play.Have not I done well, mother?”"
"马斯格罗夫太太刚刚笑眯眯地表示，要是亨里埃塔和其他人都喜欢看戏的话，她非常乐意去，这时玛丽急急忙忙地打断了，她嚷道：","Mrs. Musgrove was good humouredly beginning to express her perfect readiness for the play, if Henrietta and all the others liked it, when Mary eagerly interrupted her by exclaiming—"
"“天哪，查尔斯！你怎么能想出这种事来？订下了明晚的包厢！你忘了我们明天晚上已经与卡姆登巷约好了吗？你忘了他们特意邀请我们去见见达尔林普尔夫人和她的女儿，还有埃利奥特先生，这些都是我们家族的重要亲戚，特意要把我们介绍给他们？你怎么能这么健忘呢？”","“Good heavens, Charles!how can you think of such a thing?Take a box for to-morrow night!Have you forgot that we are engaged to Camden Place to-morrow night?and that we were most particularly asked to meet Lady Dalrymple and her daughter, and Mr. Elliot, and all the principal family connexions, on purpose to be introduced to them?How can you be so forgetful?”"
"“算了！算了！”查尔斯回答道，“晚会有什么意思？这根本不值得放在心上。要是你父亲想见见我们的话就请我们去吃晚饭了。你要想去你就去吧，反正我要去看戏。”","“Phoo!phoo!” replied Charles, “what’s an evening party?Never worth remembering.Your father might have asked us to dinner, I think, if he had wanted to see us.You may do as you like, but I shall go to the play.”"
"“啊！我说，查尔斯，你要是这么做就太可恶了，你答应要去的。”","“Oh!Charles, I declare it will be too abominable if you do, when you promised to go.”"
"“不，我没有答应。我只是干笑了一声，欠了欠身，说了句‘很高兴’。我没有答应。”","“No, I did not promise.I only smirked and bowed, and said the word ‘happy.’There was no promise.”"
"“但是你必须得去，查尔斯。你要是不去，我是不会原谅你的。人家要我们去，是特意为我们介绍的。达尔林普尔一家与我们家一向有着密切的关系。无论双方发生什么事情，都会及时通报给对方。你知道，我们是非常近的亲戚。埃利奥特先生也是，你尤其应该与他结交！你应该关注一下埃利奥特先生。你想想，他是我父亲的继承人，是埃利奥特家族未来的代表。”","“But you must go, Charles.It would be unpardonable to fail.We were asked on purpose to be introduced.There was always such a great connexion between the Dalrymples and ourselves.Nothing ever happened on either side that was not announced immediately.We are quite near relations, you know; and Mr. Elliot too, whom you ought so particularly to be acquainted with!Every attention is due to Mr. Elliot.Consider, my father’s heir: the future representative of the family.”"
"“不要跟我讲什么继承人和家族代表，”查尔斯嚷道，“我可不是那种放着当政的权贵不予理睬，反而去巴结那些新兴权贵的人。我要是看在你父亲的面子上都不想去，反而为了他的继承人而去的话，我会觉得很可耻。埃利奥特先生对我来说算得了什么？”听到这冒失的话，安妮觉得很痛快，只见温特沃思上校全神贯注地看着听着，而那最后一句话使他把那询问的目光从查尔斯身上转移到了安妮身上。","“Don’t talk to me about heirs and representatives,” cried Charles.“I am not one of those who neglect the reigning power to bow to the rising sun.If I would not go for the sake of your father, I should think it scandalous to go for the sake of his heir.What is Mr. Elliot to me?”The careless expression was life to Anne, who saw that Captain Wentworth was all attention, looking and listening with his whole soul; and that the last words brought his enquiring eyes from Charles to herself."
"查尔斯和玛丽还是这么争论着。查尔斯半严肃半开玩笑地坚持去看戏，而玛丽始终很认真很激烈地反对去看戏。而且她不忘说明，尽管自己决定要去卡姆登巷，但是如果他们要撇开她而去看戏的话，她会觉得自己受到了亏待。这时马斯格罗夫太太插话了。","Charles and Mary still talked on in the same style; he, half serious and half jesting, maintaining the scheme for the play, and she, invariably serious, most warmly opposing it, and not omitting to make it known that, however determined to go to Camden Place herself, she should not think herself very well used, if they went to the play without her.Mrs. Musgrove interposed."
"“我们还是把看戏的时间往后推一推吧。查尔斯，你最好回去把包厢换成星期二的。一家人分成两处，会令人遗憾的，何况如果安妮小姐父亲那里有晚会，她也不会去的。我敢肯定，要是安妮小姐不能跟我们一块去的话，亨里埃塔和我都不会想去看戏的。”","“We had better put it off.Charles, you had much better go back and change the box for Tuesday.It would be a pity to be divided, and we should be losing Miss Anne, too, if there is a party at her father’s; and I am sure neither Henrietta nor I should care at all for the play, if Miss Anne could not be with us.”"
"安妮确实很感谢马斯格罗夫太太的这番好意，而且也很高兴这给她提供了一个可以果断决定的机会：","Anne felt truly obliged to her for such kindness; and quite as much so for the opportunity it gave her of decidedly saying—"
"“要是只依照我的意愿的话，太太，家里的晚会（要不是照顾玛丽的想法的话）根本不是障碍。我并不喜欢这类晚会，很愿意去看戏，何况还是同你们一起去。不过，也许还是不要这么做好。”她把话说了出来，可是话说完了，她又有点忐忑不安，因为知道有人在听，她甚至不敢去看看这话产生了什么效果。","“If it depended only on my inclination, ma’am, the party at home (excepting on Mary’s account) would not be the smallest impediment.I have no pleasure in the sort of meeting, and should be too happy to change it for a play, and with you.But, it had better not be attempted, perhaps.”She had spoken it; but she trembled when it was done, conscious that her words were listened to, and daring not even to try to observe their effect."
"大家很快一致同意改在星期二。只有查尔斯还在利用这件事逗着他妻子，坚持说就算没有人想去，他明天也要去看戏。","It was soon generally agreed that Tuesday should be the day; Charles only reserving the advantage of still teasing his wife, by persisting that he would go to the play to-morrow if nobody else would."
"温特沃思上校离开座位，走到壁炉前。他的目的或许是为了不那么明显地从那里坐到安妮身边去。","Captain Wentworth left his seat, and walked to the fire-place; probably for the sake of walking away from it soon afterwards, and taking a station, with less bare-faced design, by Anne."
"“你在巴斯的时间不长，”他说，“还不太懂得享受这里晚会的乐趣。”","“You have not been long enough in Bath,” said he, “to enjoy the evening parties of the place.”"
"“哦！不。对我来说，晚会一般没有什么吸引力。我不会打牌。”","“Oh! no. The usual character of them has nothing for me. I am no card-player.”"
"“我知道你以前不打。你过去不喜欢打牌。但是时间会使人发生很多变化的。”","“You were not formerly, I know.You did not use to like cards; but time makes many changes.”"
"“我可没变多少，”安妮大声说，又停住了，生怕会造成什么误会。过了一会儿，温特沃思上校似乎触景生情，说道：“确实过去很久了！八年半过去了！”","“I am not yet so much changed,” cried Anne, and stopped, fearing she hardly knew what misconstruction.After waiting a few moments he said, and as if it were the result of immediate feeling, “It is a period, indeed!Eight years and a half is a period.”"
"他原本是不是想深入地谈谈，这只能由安妮在比较平静的时候再去思考了。而在当时温特沃思上校的话音未落，亨里埃塔却扯起了别的事情，使安妮吃了一惊。亨里埃塔想趁着眼下这段空闲时间出去走走，便招呼她的同伴们不要耽搁，免得又有人来。","Whether he would have proceeded farther was left to Anne’s imagination to ponder over in a calmer hour; for while still hearing the sounds he had uttered, she was startled to other subjects by Henrietta, eager to make use of the present leisure for getting out, and calling on her companions to lose no time, lest somebody else should come in."
"他们只好准备出发。安妮说她已经准备好了，并且尽量装出一副准备就绪的样子。但是她觉得要是亨里埃塔知道她离开座位时心里的遗憾与犹豫时，一定会同情她的，因为亨里埃塔本人对她的表兄十分喜欢，也对他的爱情非常放心。","They were obliged to move.Anne talked of being perfectly ready, and tried to look it; but she felt that could Henrietta have known the regret and reluctance of her heart in quitting that chair, in preparing to quit the room, she would have found, in all her own sensations for her cousin, in the very security of his affection, wherewith to pity her."
"不过，他们的准备工作突然停下来了。他们听到了一阵令人厌烦的脚步声，又有客人来了，门一打开，是沃尔特爵士和埃利奥特小姐，他们的到来使大家心里凉了半截。安妮马上产生了一种压抑感，不管往哪里看，她看到的都是同样的神情。屋内那种舒适、自由、快乐的气氛顿时消失了，取而代之的是冷淡的镇静与坚定的沉默或者是乏味的谈话，以此来迎合她父亲与姐姐冷漠的高雅。看到这种情况，真让人感到羞耻！","Their preparations, however, were stopped short.Alarming sounds were heard; other visitors approached, and the door was thrown open for Sir Walter and Miss Elliot, whose entrance seemed to give a general chill.Anne felt an instant oppression, and wherever she looked saw symptoms of the same.The comfort, the freedom, the gaiety of the room was over, hushed into cold composure, determined silence, or insipid talk, to meet the heartless elegance of her father and sister.How mortifying to feel that it was so!"
"安妮留神的目光对一个细节比较满意。他们又同温特沃思上校打了个招呼，伊丽莎白比以前还有礼貌了。她甚至同他寒暄了一次，而且朝他看过不止一次。实际上，伊丽莎白正在琢磨着一个重大措施。随之而来的事情就说明了这一点。她花了几分钟说了一些得体的废话，便开始发出邀请，就算是对马斯格罗夫一家应有的全部礼遇了。“明天晚上，同朋友们见见面，不是正式的晚会。”她把这一切说得非常得体，在把带来的印有“埃利奥特小姐恭请光临”字样的请帖放在桌上时，她朝大家有礼貌地泛泛一笑，又专门朝温特沃思上校笑了一下，送上一份请帖。原来她在巴斯待的时间一长，自然知道像温特沃思上校这样有风度和相貌的人士的重要性。过去的事算不了什么。现在的问题是，温特沃思上校会在她的客厅中走来走去。这张请帖就是特意送给他的。然后沃尔特爵士和伊丽莎白起身告辞了。","Her jealous eye was satisfied in one particular.Captain Wentworth was acknowledged again by each, by Elizabeth more graciously than before.She even addressed him once, and looked at him more than once.Elizabeth was, in fact, revolving a great measure.The sequel explained it.After the waste of a few minutes in saying the proper nothings, she began to give the invitation which was to comprise all the remaining dues of the Musgroves.“Tomorrow evening, to meet a few friends: no formal party.”It was all said very gracefully, and the cards with which she had provided herself, the “Miss Elliot at home,” were laid on the table, with a courteous, comprehensive smile to all, and one smile and one card more decidedly for Captain Wentworth.The truth was, that Elizabeth had been long enough in Bath to understand the importance of a man of such an air and appearance as his.The past was nothing.The present was that Captain Wentworth would move about well in her drawing-room.The card was pointedly given, and Sir Walter and Elizabeth arose and disappeared."
"这段打扰虽然很令人不快，却很短暂，当他们一出去，房门关上以后，屋里的大多数人又恢复了原来的自在和兴奋，只有安妮例外。她一心想着她刚才非常惊讶地看到她姐姐发出邀请的情景，想着温特沃思上校接受邀请时的神情。那种迟疑的神态与其说是感激不如说是惊奇，与其说是接受邀请不如说是客气的表示收到请帖。安妮了解他，她看到了他眼中的轻蔑，绝不敢相信他会决定接受这次邀请，把它看作对过去一切无礼行为的补偿。安妮的情绪低沉了下来。他们走了以后，他手中还拿着那张请帖，仿佛在深思什么。","The interruption had been short, though severe, and ease and animation returned to most of those they left as the door shut them out, but not to Anne.She could think only of the invitation she had with such astonishment witnessed, and of the manner in which it had been received; a manner of doubtful meaning, of surprise rather than gratification, of polite acknowledgement rather than acceptance.She knew him; she saw disdain in his eye, and could not venture to believe that he had determined to accept such an offering, as an atonement for all the insolence of the past.Her spirits sank.He held the card in his hand after they were gone, as if deeply considering it."
"“你们只要想一想伊丽莎白把所有人都邀请到了！”玛丽低声说道，不过大家都能听得到。“怪不得温特沃思上校那么高兴！你看他拿着请帖都不肯放下了。”","“Only think of Elizabeth’s including everybody!” whispered Mary very audibly.“I do not wonder Captain Wentworth is delighted!You see he cannot put the card out of his hand.”"
"安妮看到了他的目光，发现他两颊绯红，嘴角掠过一丝轻蔑的表情，安妮转过身去，免得再看到或听到使她烦恼的事情。","Anne caught his eye, saw his cheeks glow, and his mouth form itself into a momentary expression of contempt, and turned away, that she might neither see nor hear more to vex her."
"大家散开了。男人们有他们自己的消遣，女人们则接着做她们自己的事，安妮跟她们在一起时，他们再也没有见过面。大家诚恳地要求安妮回来吃晚饭，同他们度过这一天余下的时光。可是安妮精神紧张了那么久，现在觉得没有精力了。她只适合回家，那样她就肯定可以想怎么安静就怎么安静了。","The party separated.The gentlemen had their own pursuits, the ladies proceeded on their own business, and they met no more while Anne belonged to them.She was earnestly begged to return and dine, and give them all the rest of the day, but her spirits had been so long exerted that at present she felt unequal to more, and fit only for home, where she might be sure of being as silent as she chose."
"安妮答应第二天再来陪他们一上午，然后就疲惫不堪地走回卡姆登巷去，结束了这劳累的一天。这天晚上，她在家里只是听着伊丽莎白和克莱太太忙着安排第二天的晚会，反复清点邀请的人物，不断改进各种装饰的细节，想把这次晚会办成巴斯同类晚会中最体面的一次。与此同时，安妮一直在暗自反复琢磨温特沃思上校是否会来。他们认为他肯定会来，可是对安妮来说，这一令人痛苦的悬念从未停止过五分钟。她大体上觉得他会来，因为她总觉得他应该来，但是她不能把这事看成是某种毫无疑问的必须做到或无条件的行动，因为她脑海中总会出现一些完全相反的设想。","Promising to be with them the whole of the following morning, therefore, she closed the fatigues of the present by a toilsome walk to Camden Place, there to spend the evening chiefly in listening to the busy arrangements of Elizabeth and Mrs. Clay for the morrow’s party, the frequent enumeration of the persons invited, and the continually improving detail of all the embellishments which were to make it the most completely elegant of its kind in Bath, while harassing herself with the never-ending question, of whether Captain Wentworth would come or not?They were reckoning him as certain, but with her it was a gnawing solicitude never appeased for five minutes together.She generally thought he would come, because she generally thought he ought; but it was a case which she could not so shape into any positive act of duty or discretion, as inevitably to defy the suggestions of very opposite feelings."
"安妮从这种焦躁不安的沉思中醒来，只让克莱太太知道，就在人们认为埃利奥特先生离开巴斯三个小时之后，她看见他们两人在一起。本来安妮曾期待着，想看看克莱太太本人会不会透露这次会面的事，可是她什么也没说，于是安妮决定亲自把这事提出来。她发现克莱太太在听的时候面有愧色。这种愧色转瞬即逝。但是安妮却觉得她从克莱太太的的神情中看出：或是由于他们之间某种错综复杂的勾结，或是摄于埃利奥特先生的专横，她只得乖乖听他说教（或许有半个小时）以及不准她在沃尔特爵士身上打主意。可是克莱太太却煞有介事地惊呼了一声：","She only roused herself from the broodings of this restless agitation, to let Mrs. Clay know that she had been seen with Mr. Elliot three hours after his being supposed to be out of Bath, for having watched in vain for some intimation of the interview from the lady herself, she determined to mention it, and it seemed to her there was guilt in Mrs. Clay’s face as she listened.It was transient: cleared away in an instant; but Anne could imagine she read there the consciousness of having, by some complication of mutual trick, or some overbearing authority of his, been obliged to attend (perhaps for half an hour) to his lectures and restrictions on her designs on Sir Walter.She exclaimed, however, with a very tolerable imitation of nature:—"
"“噢！天哪！真的。你只要想想，使我非常吃惊的是，我在巴斯街上遇见了埃利奥特先生。我从来没有这么吃惊过。他掉过头来，陪我走到矿泉厅。他遇到什么事情，所以没有去桑贝里，我确实忘了是什么原因，因为我当时急于赶路，没有怎么注意他说什么。我只听说他决定不耽误他回来的时间。他想知道明天他最早什么时候能来拜访。他满脑子的明天，我一回来，得知你们增加了邀请的人数和今天发生过的种种事情，我也是满脑子想着明天，要不然，我决不会把遇见到他的事情忘得一干二净。”","“Oh! dear! very true.Only think, Miss Elliot, to my great surprise I met with Mr. Elliot in Bath Street.I was never more astonished.He turned back and walked with me to the Pump Yard.He had been prevented setting off for Thornberry, but I really forget by what; for I was in a hurry, and could not much attend, and I can only answer for his being determined not to be delayed in his return.He wanted to know how early he might be admitted to-morrow.He was full of ‘to-morrow,’ and it is very evident that I have been full of it too, ever since I entered the house, and learnt the extension of your plan and all that had happened, or my seeing him could never have gone so entirely out of my head.”"
"第二十三章","CHAPTER 23"
"安妮同史密斯太太的谈话才过去一天，就发生了使安妮更加焦虑的事情。现在除了埃利奥特先生的行为可能在某方面造成的影响之外，安妮对他的行为根本不在乎。因此第二天早晨，她就依旧理所当然地推迟去里弗斯街澄清事实。她已经答应了从早饭到晚饭都陪着马斯格罗夫太太了。她信守自己的诺言，而埃利奥特先生的品性，就像伊斯兰教山鲁佐德王妃的脑袋，再保全一天。","One day only had passed since Anne’s conversation with Mrs. Smith; but a keener interest had succeeded, and she was now so little touched by Mr. Elliot’s conduct, except by its effects in one quarter, that it became a matter of course the next morning, still to defer her explanatory visit in Rivers Street.She had promised to be with the Musgroves from breakfast to dinner.Her faith was plighted, and Mr. Elliot’s character, like the Sultaness Scheherazade’s head, must live another day."
"不过安妮不能准时赴约，因为天气不好，她望着雨为她的朋友难过，也为自己不安，然后再试着走出去。她到达白哈特旅馆，走进她要去的那个房间时，发现自己并不是准时到的，也不是第一个到的。比她早到的就有好几个人，马斯格罗夫太太在跟克罗夫特太太聊天，哈维尔上校在与温特沃思上校说话。她很快就听说，玛丽和亨里埃塔因为等不及，天一晴就出去了，不过很快就会回来的。他们还严格指令马斯格罗夫太太留住安妮，一定等她们回来。安妮只好遵命，坐了下来，她表面上装得镇静自若，自己内心却顿时陷入了种种焦虑之中，她原以为这天上午她只不过会稍稍不安而已。可是一点也没有耽搁，一点也没有浪费时间。她当即就陷入了这种痛苦的幸福，或者说是这幸福的痛苦之中。她走进屋子才两分钟，温特沃思上校说道：","She could not keep her appointment punctually, however; the weather was unfavourable, and she had grieved over the rain on her friends’ account, and felt it very much on her own, before she was able to attempt the walk.When she reached the White Hart, and made her way to the proper apartment, she found herself neither arriving quite in time, nor the first to arrive.The party before her were, Mrs. Musgrove, talking to Mrs. Croft, and Captain Harville to Captain Wentworth; and she immediately heard that Mary and Henrietta, too impatient to wait, had gone out the moment it had cleared, but would be back again soon, and that the strictest injunctions had been left with Mrs. Musgrove to keep her there till they returned.She had only to submit, sit down, be outwardly composed, and feel herself plunged at once in all the agitations which she had merely laid her account of tasting a little before the morning closed.There was no delay, no waste of time.She was deep in the happiness of such misery, or the misery of such happiness, instantly.Two minutes after her entering the room, Captain Wentworth said—"
"“现在，哈维尔，你要是把纸笔给我，我们就马上写刚才谈到的那封信吧。”","“We will write the letter we were talking of, Harville, now, if you will give me materials.”"
"纸笔就在手边，放在另一张桌子上。温特沃思上校走过去，几乎是背朝着大家，专心致志地写了起来。","Materials were at hand, on a separate table; he went to it, and nearly turning his back to them all, was engrossed by writing."
"马斯格罗夫太太正在向克罗夫特太太讲述她大女儿的婚约经过，还是用这么令人不舒服的语气，装作是在窃窃私语，实际上却让人完全听得到。安妮觉得自己不该去听她们的谈话，可是哈维尔上校似乎若有所思，不想说话，因此安妮不可避免地听到不想听的细节，比如，“马斯格罗夫先生怎么和我妹夫海特一再见面一再商量这事；我妹夫海特某天说了什么；马斯格罗夫先生第二天提了什么建议；我妹妹又提出了什么建议；年轻人想要什么；我起先说什么也不同意，但是后来经过劝说，又觉得这样倒也不错。”还有很多同样坦率地谈话。这些细枝末节，即使说得非常动听，非常文雅，也只能引起一些与这件事情有切身利害关系的人的关注，何况好心的马斯格罗夫太太还没有这种本事。克罗夫特太太听得津津有味，她不论说什么，也是都很有分寸的。安妮希望两位绅士能一心忙自己的事情，顾不上听这些谈话。","Mrs. Musgrove was giving Mrs. Croft the history of her eldest daughter’s engagement, and just in that inconvenient tone of voice which was perfectly audible while it pretended to be a whisper.Anne felt that she did not belong to the conversation, and yet, as Captain Harville seemed thoughtful and not disposed to talk, she could not avoid hearing many undesirable particulars; such as, “how Mr. Musgrove and my brother Hayter had met again and again to talk it over; what my brother Hayter had said one day, and what Mr. Musgrove had proposed the next, and what had occurred to my sister Hayter, and what the young people had wished, and what I said at first I never could consent to, but was afterwards persuaded to think might do very well,” and a great deal in the same style of open-hearted communication: minutiae which, even with every advantage of taste and delicacy, which good Mrs. Musgrove could not give, could be properly interesting only to the principals.Mrs. Croft was attending with great good-humour, and whenever she spoke at all, it was very sensibly.Anne hoped the gentlemen might each be too much self-occupied to hear."
"“就这样，夫人，事事都考虑到了，”马斯格罗夫太太大声地说着悄悄话，“尽管我们原想要另一种方式，不过总的来说，我们觉得再拖下去也不是办法，因为查尔斯•海特非常希望结婚，亨里埃塔也同样心急火燎。所以，我们觉得最好还是让他们俩立刻成亲，尽量像他们之前的很多人那样把婚事办得最体面。我说过，不管怎么样，这总比订了婚而长时间不结婚要好。”","“And so, ma’am, all these thing considered,” said Mrs. Musgrove, in her powerful whisper, “though we could have wished it different, yet, altogether, we did not think it fair to stand out any longer, for Charles Hayter was quite wild about it, and Henrietta was pretty near as bad; and so we thought they had better marry at once, and make the best of it, as many others have done before them.At any rate, said I, it will be better than a long engagement.”"
"“这正是我想说的，”克罗夫特太太大声说道，“我觉得与其让年轻人订了婚长时间不结婚，倒不如让他们凭一小笔收入安安家，然后去共同克服一些困难。我总觉得没有相互间——”","“That is precisely what I was going to observe,” cried Mrs. Croft.“I would rather have young people settle on a small income at once, and have to struggle with a few difficulties together, than be involved in a long engagement.I always think that no mutual—”"
"“哦！亲爱的克罗夫特太太，”马斯格罗夫太太不等对方说完就嚷道，“我最讨厌年轻人订婚之后长时间不结婚。我就是一贯反对我的孩子们这么做。我过去常说，如果他们肯定能够在六个月甚至一年之内结婚，而不是长时间的订婚的话，那么订婚对他们来说也是件大好事，可是长期订婚——”","“Oh! dear Mrs. Croft,” cried Mrs. Musgrove, unable to let her finish her speech, “there is nothing I so abominate for young people as a long engagement.It is what I always protested against for my children.It is all very well, I used to say, for young people to be engaged, if there is a certainty of their being able to marry in six months, or even in twelve; but a long engagement—”"
"“是啊，亲爱的太太，”克罗夫特太太说道，“或者是那种不牢靠的婚约，可能拖的时间很长。要是一开始不知道他们什么时候才有能力结婚，那是很不可靠，很不明智的。我认为所有做父母的都应该尽量阻止这种婚约。”","“Yes, dear ma’am,” said Mrs. Croft, “or an uncertain engagement, an engagement which may be long.To begin without knowing that at such a time there will be the means of marrying, I hold to be very unsafe and unwise, and what I think all parents should prevent as far as they can.”"
"听到这里，安妮意外地感到这番谈话很有意思。她觉得这种看法对她也很适用，浑身顿时紧张起来。同时她的眼睛本能地朝远处的桌子瞥了一下，只见温特沃思上校停住了笔，抬起头，愣愣地听着，随即转脸又快又颇有意味地看了安妮一眼。","Anne found an unexpected interest here.She felt its application to herself, felt it in a nervous thrill all over her; and at the same moment that her eyes instinctively glanced towards the distant table, Captain Wentworth’s pen ceased to move, his head was raised, pausing, listening, and he turned round the next instant to give a look, one quick, conscious look at her."
"两位夫人继续谈着，一再强调着那些她们两人都同意的真理，而且还列举了她们所看到的反面例子造成的不利影响，以此来证明她们的观点。但是安妮什么也听不清楚了，她们的话只在她耳朵嗡嗡作响，她心里十分慌乱。","The two ladies continued to talk, to re-urge the same admitted truths, and enforce them with such examples of the ill effect of a contrary practice as had fallen within their observation, but Anne heard nothing distinctly; it was only a buzz of words in her ear, her mind was in confusion."
"哈维尔上校刚才确实什么话也没听见，现在离开座位，走到窗口，尽管安妮是完全心不在焉的，但是安妮看起来是在看他。安妮渐渐意识到他是在邀请她到他身边去。他微笑地望着安妮，向她微微点点头，意思是说：“到我这儿来，我有话要对你说。”虽然他们之间的交情还不那么深，但他那自然、大方而又友好的态度，表达了一位老朋友的真情，因而更加显得盛情难却了。安妮站起身来，走到他身边。哈维尔上校站立的窗口在房间的另一端，与两位太太的座位遥遥相望，虽说靠近温特沃思上校的桌子，但是并不是很近。等安妮走到哈维尔上校身旁，他的脸上又恢复了那种严肃、沉思的神情，似乎这才是他本来的面目。","Captain Harville, who had in truth been hearing none of it, now left his seat, and moved to a window, and Anne seeming to watch him, though it was from thorough absence of mind, became gradually sensible that he was inviting her to join him where he stood.He looked at her with a smile, and a little motion of the head, which expressed, “Come to me, I have something to say;” and the unaffected, easy kindness of manner which denoted the feelings of an older acquaintance than he really was, strongly enforced the invitation.She roused herself and went to him.The window at which he stood was at the other end of the room from where the two ladies were sitting, and though nearer to Captain Wentworth’s table, not very near.As she joined him, Captain Harville’s countenance re-assumed the serious, thoughtful expression which seemed its natural character."
"“看这儿，”他一面说着，一面打开他手中的一个小包，拿出一张小小的微型画像，“你知道这是谁吗？”","“Look here,” said he, unfolding a parcel in his hand, and displaying a small miniature painting, “do you know who that is?”"
"“当然是本威克上校。”","“Certainly: Captain Benwick.”"
"“对，你也许能猜到这是给谁的。不过，”（用低沉的语气）“这不是为她画的。埃利奥特小姐，你还记得我们一起在莱姆时替他感到难过吗？当时我一点没想到——不过无关紧要了。这是在好望角画的。他在好望角遇到一位聪明年轻的德国画家，为了实现对我可怜妹妹的诺言，他让那位画家替他画了幅肖像，要带回来给我妹妹。现在我却负责装帧好送给另一个人。他给了我这么一个任务！不过他还能委托谁呢？但愿我能够体谅他。实际上，把画像交给另外一个人，我并不感到难过。他主动要求这么干的。”（说着望了温特沃思上校一眼）“他正在为此事写信呢。”他嘴唇颤抖了一下，补充道，“可怜的范妮！她可不会这么快就忘记本威克！”","“Yes, and you may guess who it is for.But,” (in a deep tone,) “it was not done for her.Miss Elliot, do you remember our walking together at Lyme, and grieving for him?I little thought then—but no matter.This was drawn at the Cape.He met with a clever young German artist at the Cape, and in compliance with a promise to my poor sister, sat to him, and was bringing it home for her; and I have now the charge of getting it properly set for another!It was a commission to me!But who else was there to employ?I hope I can allow for him.I am not sorry, indeed, to make it over to another.He undertakes it;” (looking towards Captain Wentworth,) “he is writing about it now.”And with a quivering lip he wound up the whole by adding, “Poor Fanny! she would not have forgotten him so soon!”"
"“没错，”安妮以一种低沉而充满感情的声音回答道。“这一点我不难相信。”","“No,” replied Anne, in a low, feeling voice.“That I can easily believe.”"
"“这不是她的本性。她爱本威克。”","“It was not in her nature.She doted on him.”"
"“这是违背任何一个曾经真心相爱的女人的本性的。”","“It would not be the nature of any woman who truly loved.”"
"哈维尔上校微笑了一下，似乎在说，“你能保证所有女人都如此吗？”安妮笑盈盈地回答了这个问题：“是的。我们当然不会像你们忘记我们那样那么快地忘记你们。或许与其说这是我们的优点，倒不如说我们命该如此。我们难以控制自己。我们住在家里，生活平静，活动空间有限，总是受到感情的折磨。你们男人不得不努力工作。你们总有事业，有追求，有这样那样的事情，你们很快就会卷入世俗事务中去，而不断的工作和变动很快就会淡化你们的各种感觉。”","Captain Harville smiled, as much as to say, “Do you claim that for your sex?” and she answered the question, smiling also, “Yes.We certainly do not forget you as soon as you forget us.It is, perhaps, our fate rather than our merit.We cannot help ourselves.We live at home, quiet, confined, and our feelings prey upon us.You are forced on exertion.You have always a profession, pursuits, business of some sort or other, to take you back into the world immediately, and continual occupation and change soon weaken impressions.”"
"“就算你说得不错，世俗事务对男人有此作用（不过，我并不认为你是对的），可是这话对本威克并不适用。没有人强迫他去做任何事情。当时天下太平了，他马上回到岸上，从那以后他一直同我们住在一起，生活在我们小小的家庭圈子里。”","“Granting your assertion that the world does all this so soon for men (which, however, I do not think I shall grant), it does not apply to Benwick.He has not been forced upon any exertion.The peace turned him on shore at the very moment, and he has been living with us, in our little family circle, ever since.”"
"“的确，”安妮说道，“的确是这样。我没有想到这一点，不过现在我们能说什么呢，哈维尔上校？如果这种变化不是来自外界环境，那就一定是来自内心。本威克舰长之所以发生变化，肯定是出于本性，出于男人的本性。”","“True,” said Anne, “very true; I did not recollect; but what shall we say now, Captain Harville?If the change be not from outward circumstances, it must be from within; it must be nature, man’s nature, which has done the business for Captain Benwick.”"
"“不，不，不是男人的本性。”说男人的本性没有女人坚贞，忘掉他们所爱或者曾经爱过的人，我不能同意。我认为恰恰相反。我认为我们的身体与精神是完全一致的，因为我们的身体最强壮，感情也就最强烈，能够忍受最痛苦的困境，渡过最强烈的风暴。”","“No, no, it is not man’s nature.I will not allow it to be more man’s nature than woman’s to be inconstant and forget those they do love, or have loved.I believe the reverse.I believe in a true analogy between our bodily frames and our mental; and that as our bodies are the strongest, so are our feelings; capable of bearing most rough usage, and riding out the heaviest weather.”"
"“你们的感情可能是最强烈的，”安妮回答道，“但是用同样的推理方法，我们也可以说我们的感情是最温柔的。男人是比女人更加强壮，但并不比女人长寿，这恰好表明我对男女感情本质的看法。不，要不然的话，你们会感到很痛苦。你们要同种种困难、困苦和危险作斗争。你们总是在辛勤劳动，面对各种危险和艰难。你们离开了家庭、故土和朋友。时间、健康或者生命都不能说是你们自己的。这确实太苦了。”（用颤抖的声音），“如果这些再加上女人的感情。”","“Your feelings may be the strongest,” replied Anne, “but the same spirit of analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the most tender.Man is more robust than woman, but he is not longer lived; which exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachments.Nay, it would be too hard upon you, if it were otherwise.You have difficulties, and privations, and dangers enough to struggle with.You are always labouring and toiling, exposed to every risk and hardship.Your home, country, friends, all quitted.Neither time, nor health, nor life, to be called your own.It would be hard, indeed” (with a faltering voice), “if woman’s feelings were to be added to all this.”"
"“在这个问题上我们永远也不会达成一致，”哈维尔上校刚开始说，温特沃思上校坐着的那块一直很安静的地方发出了一点响声，引起了他们的注意。那只不过是他的钢笔掉在了地上，可是安妮惊讶地发现他离她比她原本想象的要近。她有点怀疑，钢笔之所以掉在地上，是因为他在注意他们，想听清楚他们的谈话，不过安妮觉得，他不可能听清的。","“We shall never agree upon this question,” Captain Harville was beginning to say, when a slight noise called their attention to Captain Wentworth’s hitherto perfectly quiet division of the room.It was nothing more than that his pen had fallen down; but Anne was startled at finding him nearer than she had supposed, and half inclined to suspect that the pen had only fallen because he had been occupied by them, striving to catch sounds, which yet she did not think he could have caught."
"“你的信写好了吗？”哈维尔上校说。","“Have you finished your letter?” said Captain Harville."
"“还没全写好，还剩几句。再有五分钟我就可以写完了。”","“Not quite, a few lines more.I shall have done in five minutes.”"
"“我这边倒不着急。你一写好，我就可以走。我正处在理想抛锚地，”（朝安妮笑了笑，）“供应充足，什么也不缺。根本不急于起航。好了，埃利奥特小姐，”（压低了他的声音，）“正如我刚才所说的，在这个问题上，我想我们永远也不会达成一致。大概任何男人和女人都不会的。不过请允许我指出，种种史实都与你的观点背道而驰——所有的故事、散文和诗歌。要是我有本威克那样的记忆力，我马上就可以引出五十个事例来证明我的观点。我觉得我一生中很少看过有哪一本书不讲到女人是反复无常的。诗歌和谚语都说女人水性杨花。不过，你也许会说，那些都是男人写的。”","“There is no hurry on my side.I am only ready whenever you are.I am in very good anchorage here,” (smiling at Anne,) “well supplied, and want for nothing.No hurry for a signal at all.Well, Miss Elliot,” (lowering his voice,) “as I was saying we shall never agree, I suppose, upon this point.No man and woman, would, probably.But let me observe that all histories are against you—all stories, prose and verse.If I had such a memory as Benwick, I could bring you fifty quotations in a moment on my side the argument, and I do not think I ever opened a book in my life which had not something to say upon woman’s inconstancy.Songs and proverbs, all talk of woman’s fickleness.But perhaps you will say, these were all written by men.”"
"“也许我会这样说的。是的，是的，请你不要在书中找例子了。男人们在讲述他们的故事方面比我们强多了。他们受的教育比我们高，笔杆子还握在他们手里。我不认为书本可以证明一切问题。”","“Perhaps I shall.Yes, yes, if you please, no reference to examples in books.Men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story.Education has been theirs in so much higher a degree; the pen has been in their hands.I will not allow books to prove anything.”"
"“但是我们怎样才能证明一切问题呢？”","“But how shall we prove anything?”"
"“我们永远也说不清楚。在这个问题上我们永远也弄不出个结果来。这种意见分歧是永远也无法说清楚的。我们大概从一开始就有一些偏爱各自的同类，并在这种偏爱的基础上寻找发生在我们圈子内的事情来说明自己的观点。这些事情有很多（也许正是这些给我们印象最深刻的事情），要是不泄露别人的秘密或者不说些不该说的话，是无法说的。”","“We never shall.We never can expect to prove any thing upon such a point.It is a difference of opinion which does not admit of proof.We each begin, probably, with a little bias towards our own sex; and upon that bias build every circumstance in favour of it which has occurred within our own circle; many of which circumstances (perhaps those very cases which strike us the most) may be precisely such as cannot be brought forward without betraying a confidence, or in some respect saying what should not be said.”"
"“啊！”哈维尔上校大声叫道，情绪十分激动，“一个男人最后看一眼自己的妻子和孩子，眼巴巴地望着把他们送走的小船，直到看不见为止，转身走开时说道，‘天晓得我们还会不会再见面！’我要能使你理解他当时的痛苦心情就好了。还有，我真希望你能够知道，当他确实再见到他们；经过了也许是十二个月的离别，他回来了，但得停泊在另一个港口，并企图自欺欺人地说，‘他们要到某一天才能来到，’实际上却一直希望他们提前十二个小时到达，直到他终于看到妻儿来了，而且提前了几个小时，就像上帝给他们插上了翅膀，他那时的欢乐心情我要是能向你讲清楚就好了！要是我能够把这一切都向你解释清楚，把一个男人为了他们生命中的宝贝能够承受和能够做到的努力，并且以此为荣都向你解释清楚，该有多好！你知道，我说得只是有良心的男人！”说着，他激动地用手按了按自己的心。","“Ah!” cried Captain Harville, in a tone of strong feeling, “if I could but make you comprehend what a man suffers when he takes a last look at his wife and children, and watches the boat that he has sent them off in, as long as it is in sight, and then turns away and says, ‘God knows whether we ever meet again!’And then, if I could convey to you the glow of his soul when he does see them again; when, coming back after a twelvemonth’s absence, perhaps, and obliged to put into another port, he calculates how soon it be possible to get them there, pretending to deceive himself, and saying, ‘They cannot be here till such a day,’ but all the while hoping for them twelve hours sooner, and seeing them arrive at last, as if Heaven had given them wings, by many hours sooner still!If I could explain to you all this, and all that a man can bear and do, and glories to do, for the sake of these treasures of his existence!I speak, you know, only of such men as have hearts!” pressing his own with emotion."
"“哦！”安妮急切地说道，“我希望我能公正地对待你和与你相似的人们的感情。但愿我不会低估我的同胞热烈而真挚的感情！如果我竟敢说，只有女人才懂得真正的爱情和坚贞，那我就活该受人鄙视。不，我相信你们在婚后生活中能表现出的种种伟大而善良的感情。我相信你们能做出种种重大努力，在家庭生活中能尽量克制，只要——如果允许我这么说的话——只要你们有一个目标。我是说只要你们所爱的女人还活着，而且是为你们活着。我认为女性的特权（这并不值得羡慕，你们不必贪图这一点），就是爱得最长久，甚至在爱情和希望已破灭时仍是如此。”","“Oh!” cried Anne eagerly, “I hope I do justice to all that is felt by you, and by those who resemble you.God forbid that I should undervalue the warm and faithful feelings of any of my fellow-creatures!I should deserve utter contempt if I dared to suppose that true attachment and constancy were known only by woman.No, I believe you capable of everything great and good in your married lives.I believe you equal to every important exertion, and to every domestic forbearance, so long as—if I may be allowed the expression—so long as you have an object.I mean while the woman you love lives, and lives for you.All the privilege I claim for my own sex (it is not a very enviable one; you need not covet it), is that of loving longest, when existence or when hope is gone.”"
"安妮一时之间再也无法说下去。她的心情过于激动，呼吸过于急促了。","She could not immediately have uttered another sentence; her heart was too full, her breath too much oppressed."
"“你是个好人，”哈维尔上校大声说道，十分亲切地把手放在她的手臂上。“我争不过你。只要我一想起本威克，我就无话可说了。”","“You are a good soul,” cried Captain Harville, putting his hand on her arm, quite affectionately.“There is no quarrelling with you.And when I think of Benwick, my tongue is tied.”"
"这时他们的注意力被吸引到别人那里了。克罗夫特太太正要告辞。","Their attention was called towards the others.Mrs. Croft was taking leave."
"“我想，弗雷德里克，我们就在这里分手吧，”她说，“我要回家了，你和你朋友还有事要办。今天晚上我们可能会在你们的晚会上再次愉快地见面的。”（转向安妮。）“昨天我们收到了你姐姐的请帖，我知道弗雷德里克也接到了，尽管我没有看到。弗雷德里克，你是不是同我们一样，没有什么别的约会吧？”","“Here, Frederick, you and I part company, I believe,” said she.“I am going home, and you have an engagement with your friend.To-night we may have the pleasure of all meeting again at your party,” (turning to Anne.)“We had your sister’s card yesterday, and I understood Frederick had a card too, though I did not see it; and you are disengaged, Frederick, are you not, as well as ourselves?”"
"温特沃思上校正匆匆地叠信，既像是不能作出全面回答，又像是不愿意作出全面回答。","Captain Wentworth was folding up a letter in great haste, and either could not or would not answer fully."
"“是的，”他说，“的确如此，我们就在这里分手，但是哈维尔和我随后就来。哈维尔，你要是准备好了，我再过半分钟就行了。我知道你早就想走。再过半分钟我就陪你回去。”","“Yes,” said he, “very true; here we separate, but Harville and I shall soon be after you; that is, Harville, if you are ready, I am in half a minute.I know you will not be sorry to be off.I shall be at your service in half a minute.”"
"克罗夫特太太走了，温特沃思上校匆匆封好信，的确忙完了，甚至显得坐立不安，似乎急着要走。安妮不知道这是什么意思。哈维尔上校十分友好地对安妮说了声“再见，上帝保佑你！”可是温特沃思上校却一句话也没说，连看也没看她一眼。他看没看她一眼就从房间走了出去。","Mrs. Croft left them, and Captain Wentworth, having sealed his letter with great rapidity, was indeed ready, and had even a hurried, agitated air, which shewed impatience to be gone.Anne knew not how to understand it.She had the kindest “Good morning, God bless you!” from Captain Harville, but from him not a word, nor a look!He had passed out of the room without a look!"
"然而安妮刚刚走进温特沃思上校刚刚写信的桌子，就听到了有脚步声走回来。房门打开了，回来的正是温特沃思上校。他请大家原谅，说是忘记了拿手套，接着马上穿过房间走到书桌前，背对着马斯格罗夫太太从散乱的信纸下面抽出一封信，放在安妮面前，用深情、恳切的目光盯着她看了一会儿，然后匆匆拿起手套，又走出屋子。马斯格罗夫太太几乎还没有发觉他进来，可见动作之神速！","She had only time, however, to move closer to the table where he had been writing, when footsteps were heard returning; the door opened, it was himself.He begged their pardon, but he had forgotten his gloves, and instantly crossing the room to the writing table, he drew out a letter from under the scattered paper, placed it before Anne with eyes of glowing entreaty fixed on her for a time, and hastily collecting his gloves, was again out of the room, almost before Mrs. Musgrove was aware of his being in it: the work of an instant!"
"这一刹那在安妮心中激起的万千思绪，几乎难以形容。这封信显然是温特沃思上校刚才匆匆叠起的那封，信上“安妮•埃利奥特小姐收”的几个字写得很难辨认。安妮刚才以为他只不过是在给本威克舰长写信，原来也给她写了一封！这封信决定着这个世界能赋予她的一切。世界上什么事情都可能发生，什么事情都比悬念易于应付。马斯格罗夫太太在她那桌旁忙着一些琐事。安妮借着这一有利时机，于是一屁股坐进温特沃思上校刚才坐过的椅子，靠着他靠过和写过信的地方，贪婪地读着下面的文字：","The revolution which one instant had made in Anne, was almost beyond expression.The letter, with a direction hardly legible, to “Miss A. E.—,” was evidently the one which he had been folding so hastily.While supposed to be writing only to Captain Benwick, he had been also addressing her!On the contents of that letter depended all which this world could do for her.Anything was possible, anything might be defied rather than suspense.Mrs. Musgrove had little arrangements of her own at her own table; to their protection she must trust, and sinking into the chair which he had occupied, succeeding to the very spot where he had leaned and written, her eyes devoured the following words:"
"“我再也不能默默地听下去了。我必须要用我力所能及的方法来同你谈谈。你刺伤了我的心灵。我是既有痛苦又有希望。请别对我说为时太晚，也别说这种珍贵的感情已经一去不复返了。我再次向你求婚，比起八年半前几乎被你撕碎的心，现在我的心更加属于你。你不能说男人比女人健忘，也不能说男人的爱情消亡得更早。　我除了你之外，再也没有爱过别人。我或许曾经不公正，或许意志软弱，满腔怨恨，但是我从来没有朝三暮四。我到巴斯来只是为了你。为了你一个人，我搜索枯肠。难道你还没有看出来吗？难道你还不理解我的心吗？我觉得你对我的感情一定非常了解，要是我能同样看出你的真实情感，我连这十天也等不了了。我简直写不下去了。时刻响在我耳边的一切，使我不能自持。你虽然压低了声音，但我能从你的声音里分辨出别人听不出的口气。你善良，你出类拔萃！你的确能公正地对待男人。你确实相信男人也有忠贞不渝的爱情。请相信我最热诚、最坚定不移的爱情。弗•温。","“I can listen no longer in silence.I must speak to you by such means as are within my reach.You pierce my soul.I am half agony, half hope.Tell me not that I am too late, that such precious feelings are gone for ever.I offer myself to you again with a heart even more your own than when you almost broke it, eight years and a half ago.Dare not say that man forgets sooner than woman, that his love has an earlier death.I have loved none but you.Unjust I may have been, weak and resentful I have been, but never inconstant.You alone have brought me to Bath.For you alone, I think and plan.Have you not seen this?Can you fail to have understood my wishes?I had not waited even these ten days, could I have read your feelings, as I think you must have penetrated mine.I can hardly write.I am every instant hearing something which overpowers me.You sink your voice, but I can distinguish the tones of that voice when they would be lost on others.Too good, too excellent creature!You do us justice, indeed.You do believe that there is true attachment and constancy among men.Believe it to be most fervent, most undeviating, in F. W."
"“我不知道我的命运如何，我必须走了。不过，我会尽快回来，或者是找到你们大家。一句话，一个眼神，就足以决定我今晚是到你父亲府上还是永远不去。”","“I must go, uncertain of my fate; but I shall return hither, or follow your party, as soon as possible.A word, a look, will be enough to decide whether I enter your father’s house this evening or never.”"
"安妮看到这样一封信，心里是不会马上平静下来的。要是有半个小时的独处和思考，安妮或许会平静下来。可是仅仅过了十分钟，她的思绪便被打断了，由于她的处境的种种限制，心里不可能平静下来。每时每刻都在增加她的激动不安。一种巨大的幸福感使她喜不自禁。她满怀激动的第一个阶段还没有过去，查尔斯、玛丽和亨里埃塔就都进来了。","Such a letter was not to be soon recovered from.Half and hour’s solitude and reflection might have tranquillized her; but the ten minutes only which now passed before she was interrupted, with all the restraints of her situation, could do nothing towards tranquillity.Every moment rather brought fresh agitation.It was overpowering happiness.And before she was beyond the first stage of full sensation, Charles, Mary, and Henrietta all came in."
"这时，安妮不得不竭力克制，装出一副泰然自若的样子。但是过了一会儿之后，她就再也坚持不下去了。她再也听不进别人的谈话，迫不得已，只好推说身体不适，请他们原谅。这时，他们也看得出安妮似乎很不舒服，都很吃惊和关心，怎么也不肯把她留下后径自出去。这太可怕了。他们只要一走，把她留在安静的房间里，她就会恢复过来。但是他们一个个站在或等在她的周围，把她弄得心烦意乱。她不得已，只好说她要回家了。","The absolute necessity of seeming like herself produced then an immediate struggle; but after a while she could do no more.She began not to understand a word they said, and was obliged to plead indisposition and excuse herself.They could then see that she looked very ill, were shocked and concerned, and would not stir without her for the world.This was dreadful.Would they only have gone away, and left her in the quiet possession of that room it would have been her cure; but to have them all standing or waiting around her was distracting, and in desperation, she said she would go home."
"“对了，亲爱的，”马斯格罗夫太太大声喊道，“赶紧回家，好好休息一下，晚上好能参加晚会。要是萨拉能在这儿照顾你就好了，可惜我自己不是医生。查尔斯，打电话叫轿子。她肯定不能走路。”","“By all means, my dear,” cried Mrs. Musgrove, “go home directly, and take care of yourself, that you may be fit for the evening.I wish Sarah was here to doctor you, but I am no doctor myself.Charles, ring and order a chair.She must not walk.”"
"但是她绝对不能坐轿回去。那比什么都糟糕！这将使她失去独自安静地走回去同温特沃思上校说两句话的机会（她感到很有把握遇到他），这是她无法忍受的。安妮诚恳地说她不愿意坐车，马斯格罗夫太太只想到路易莎的不适，便带着几分忧虑自我安慰道，安妮的不舒服并不是由于摔过跤引起的。安妮最近没有摔倒过，头上没有受伤。她完全确信安妮没有摔过跤之后，才放心地让安妮走回家，相信到晚上安妮会有所好转。","But the chair would never do.Worse than all!To lose the possibility of speaking two words to Captain Wentworth in the course of her quiet, solitary progress up the town (and she felt almost certain of meeting him) could not be borne.The chair was earnestly protested against, and Mrs. Musgrove, who thought only of one sort of illness, having assured herself with some anxiety, that there had been no fall in the case; that Anne had not at any time lately slipped down, and got a blow on her head; that she was perfectly convinced of having had no fall; could part with her cheerfully, and depend on finding her better at night."
"安妮不想放过任何可能的预防措施，她犹豫了一会儿，说道：","Anxious to omit no possible precaution, Anne struggled, and said—"
"“太太，我怕这事没有完全说清楚。请你转告其他几位先生，我们希望今晚见到你们所有的人。我担心会有什么差错，所以希望你特别转告哈维尔上校和温特沃思上校，说我们希望见到他们两位。”","“I am afraid, ma’am, that it is not perfectly understood.Pray be so good as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope to see your whole party this evening.I am afraid there had been some mistake; and I wish you particularly to assure Captain Harville and Captain Wentworth, that we hope to see them both.”"
"“哦！亲爱的，这一点大家都很清楚，我向你保证。哈维尔上校一心一意想要去呢。”","“Oh! my dear, it is quite understood, I give you my word.Captain Harville has no thought but of going.”"
"“你真这样认为？但是我有些担心。他们要是不去，我会感到很遗憾。你能答应我见到他们的时候再提一下吗？我想今天上午你会再见到他们两个人的。请答应我吧。”","“Do you think so?But I am afraid; and I should be so very sorry.Will you promise me to mention it, when you see them again?You will see them both this morning, I dare say.Do promise me.”"
"“你既然这么要求，我当然转告。查尔斯，如果你在什么地方看到哈维尔上校，记得把安妮小姐的话转告给他。不过，说真的，亲爱的，你不用担心。我敢担保，哈维尔上校一定会去的。我看，温特沃思上校也会去的。”","“To be sure I will, if you wish it.Charles, if you see Captain Harville anywhere, remember to give Miss Anne’s message.But indeed, my dear, you need not be uneasy.Captain Harville holds himself quite engaged, I’ll answer for it; and Captain Wentworth the same, I dare say.”"
"安妮不能再说什么了。可是她内心预感到，要是事不凑巧，也许会影响她这十全十美的幸福。不过，这个念头不会持续多久。即使温特沃思上校本人不来卡姆登巷，她也可以托哈维尔上校捎个易懂的口信过去。可是当时又出现了一件伤脑筋的事情。查尔斯出于真切的关心和善良的本性，要送安妮回家，怎么拦也拦不住。这简直有点残酷了。但她又不能老是不领情。查尔斯本来同枪店约好了，但是为了陪安妮回家，他就牺牲了这次约会。所以安妮同查尔斯一起走了，脸上装出一副感激的表情。","Anne could do no more; but her heart prophesied some mischance to damp the perfection of her felicity.It could not be very lasting, however.Even if he did not come to Camden Place himself, it would be in her power to send an intelligible sentence by Captain Harville.Another momentary vexation occurred.Charles, in his real concern and good nature, would go home with her; there was no preventing him.This was almost cruel.But she could not be long ungrateful; he was sacrificing an engagement at a gunsmith’s, to be of use to her; and she set off with him, with no feeling but gratitude apparent."
"他们走到联盟街，听到身后有一阵急促的脚步声，这阵熟悉的脚步声使安妮对温特沃思上校的出现略略有了些思想准备。他追上了他们俩，但似乎又有点犹豫不决，是同他们一起走呢，还是就从他们身旁走过去呢。他什么也没说，只是看着安妮。安妮能够控制自己，可以任他看着，而不感到厌恶。这时，安妮先前苍白的面颊变得绯红，先前迟疑的动作现在也变得果断了。温特沃思上校在安妮身边走着。一会儿，查尔斯突然产生了一个念头，说道：","They were on Union Street, when a quicker step behind, a something of familiar sound, gave her two moments’ preparation for the sight of Captain Wentworth.He joined them; but, as if irresolute whether to join or to pass on, said nothing, only looked.Anne could command herself enough to receive that look, and not repulsively.The cheeks which had been pale now glowed, and the movements which had hesitated were decided.He walked by her side.Presently, struck by a sudden thought, Charles said—"
"“温特沃思上校，你走那一条路？是只去盖伊街，还是要再往前走？”","“Captain Wentworth, which way are you going?Only to Gay Street, or farther up the town?”"
"“我也不知道，”温特沃思上校惊讶地回答道。","“I hardly know,” replied Captain Wentworth, surprised."
"“你要去贝尔蒙特街吗？你要到卡姆登巷附近吗？因为要是这样的话，我就没有顾虑地请你代替我将安妮送回家。她今天上午太累了，走这么远的路没有人照顾可不行，我得去市场上那个家伙的店里。他答应给我看一支他要出售的好枪，他说过要尽可能地在打包之前留给我看看。要是我现在不回去，我就没有机会了。从他的描述来看，非常像我的一支二号双筒枪，就是有一天你拿着在温思罗普附近打猎的那一支。”","“Are you going as high as Belmont?Are you going near Camden Place?Because, if you are, I shall have no scruple in asking you to take my place, and give Anne your arm to her father’s door.She is rather done for this morning, and must not go so far without help, and I ought to be at that fellow’s in the Market Place.He promised me the sight of a capital gun he is just going to send off; said he would keep it unpacked to the last possible moment, that I might see it; and if I do not turn back now, I have no chance.By his description, a good deal like the second size double-barrel of mine, which you shot with one day round Winthrop.”"
"不可能有反对意见。有的只是恰如其分的欣然同意，是做给公众看的乐于助人的顺从。他敛起笑容，心中却暗自狂喜。半分钟以后，查尔斯又走到了联盟街的另一头，另外两个人就一起往前走去。不久，他们彼此间商量了商量，决定朝相对安静而比较偏僻的砾石小路走去。在那里，他们可以尽情地交谈，使这一刻成为名副其实的幸福时刻，并把它变成他们今后生活中永恒的回忆。在那里他们重温了当初的情愫和诺言，当年这些情愫和诺言似乎一度使一切都显得万无一失，但是随之而来的却是这么多年的分离与隔阂。现在他们又重新回到了过去，也许，重新团聚比当初预期的更为幸福。他们了解彼此的性格、忠心和情意，他们的感情更为亲切，更为可靠，更为坚定，更有利于作出抉择，作出的抉择也更有道理。然后，他们沿着缓坡慢慢地往上走去，全然不注意周围的人群，既看不见闲逛的政客、忙碌的管家、调情的姑娘，也看不见保姆和儿童，他们尽情沉浸于对往事的回忆与反省里，尤其是对不久以前发生的引人入胜的、趣味无穷情况的解释中。他们回顾了上星期的种种细微的变化，谈到了昨天和今天，简直有说不完的话。","There could not be an objection.There could be only the most proper alacrity, a most obliging compliance for public view; and smiles reined in and spirits dancing in private rapture.In half a minute Charles was at the bottom of Union Street again, and the other two proceeding together: and soon words enough had passed between them to decide their direction towards the comparatively quiet and retired gravel walk, where the power of conversation would make the present hour a blessing indeed, and prepare it for all the immortality which the happiest recollections of their own future lives could bestow.There they exchanged again those feelings and those promises which had once before seemed to secure everything, but which had been followed by so many, many years of division and estrangement.There they returned again into the past, more exquisitely happy, perhaps, in their re-union, than when it had been first projected; more tender, more tried, more fixed in a knowledge of each other’s character, truth, and attachment; more equal to act, more justified in acting.And there, as they slowly paced the gradual ascent, heedless of every group around them, seeing neither sauntering politicians, bustling housekeepers, flirting girls, nor nursery-maids and children, they could indulge in those retrospections and acknowledgements, and especially in those explanations of what had directly preceded the present moment, which were so poignant and so ceaseless in interest.All the little variations of the last week were gone through; and of yesterday and today there could scarcely be an end."
"安妮没有误解他。对埃利奥特先生的嫉妒成了他绊脚石，引起了他的猜疑与痛苦。他在巴斯第一次见到安妮时，这种嫉妒心便开始作祟，后来收敛了一小段时间，接着又回来作祟，破坏了那次音乐会。在最后的24个小时内，这种嫉妒心左右着温特沃思上校的一言一行，左右着他避而不谈或不做某事。但是安妮的神情、话语或者行动偶尔也引起了一些较乐观的希望。当安妮同哈维尔上校说话时，他听到了她的感情和语气，嫉妒心最终被克服了。于是在这种不可抗拒的感情和语气左右下，他抓起了一张纸，倾吐了自己的衷肠。","She had not mistaken him.Jealousy of Mr. Elliot had been the retarding weight, the doubt, the torment.That had begun to operate in the very hour of first meeting her in Bath; that had returned, after a short suspension, to ruin the concert; and that had influenced him in everything he had said and done, or omitted to say and do, in the last four-and-twenty hours.It had been gradually yielding to the better hopes which her looks, or words, or actions occasionally encouraged; it had been vanquished at last by those sentiments and those tones which had reached him while she talked with Captain Harville; and under the irresistible governance of which he had seized a sheet of paper, and poured out his feelings."
"对于信中所写的一切，他没有什么要收回或者加以解释的。他一再表白除了安妮之外他没有爱过任何人。从来没有人能取代过安妮。他甚至认为，他从没有见过能比得上安妮的女人。的确，他不得不承认：他的忠贞不渝是无意识的，不，是无意中形成的。他本来打算忘掉她，而且以为自己已经忘掉了。他一度以为自己对她已经淡漠，但这只不过是一时生气罢了。他曾对她的美德作出过不公正的评价，因为他曾经遭到了这些美德的伤害。现在安妮的性格在他心中是完美的，刚柔适中，可爱至极。不过他不得不承认，他只是在阿珀克罗斯才懂得公正地看待安妮，也只有在莱姆，他才开始了解自己。在莱姆，他得到了不止一次的教训。埃利奥特先生路过时那种爱慕的眼神至少唤醒了他，而在科布和在哈维尔上校家的种种情景使他坚定了安妮的卓越不凡。","Of what he had then written, nothing was to be retracted or qualified.He persisted in having loved none but her.She had never been supplanted.He never even believed himself to see her equal.Thus much indeed he was obliged to acknowledge: that he had been constant unconsciously, nay unintentionally; that he had meant to forget her, and believed it to be done.He had imagined himself indifferent, when he had only been angry; and he had been unjust to her merits, because he had been a sufferer from them.Her character was now fixed on his mind as perfection itself, maintaining the loveliest medium of fortitude and gentleness; but he was obliged to acknowledge that only at Uppercross had he learnt to do her justice, and only at Lyme had he begun to understand himself.At Lyme, he had received lessons of more than one sort.The passing admiration of Mr. Elliot had at least roused him, and the scenes on the Cobb and at Captain Harville’s had fixed her superiority."
"至于他先前试图追求路易莎•马斯格罗夫（出于嗔怒与傲慢），他坚决表示他一直认为那是不可能的。他并不喜欢，也不可能喜欢路易莎。不过直到那天，直到那天以后他有空闲静心思考时，他才懂得安妮杰出完美的心灵是路易莎望尘莫及的，才了解安妮的心已彻底地征服了他。那时，他才懂得区分坚持原则与一意孤行，区分掉以轻心的鲁莽与深思熟虑的坚定。那时，他才看到一切都在提升他对失去的姑娘的评价。他开始痛惜自己的傲慢、愚蠢和疯狂的怨恨，正是这一切才使他又一次邂逅安妮的时候没有努力去再次赢得她。","In his preceding attempts to attach himself to Louisa Musgrove (the attempts of angry pride), he protested that he had for ever felt it to be impossible; that he had not cared, could not care, for Louisa; though till that day, till the leisure for reflection which followed it, he had not understood the perfect excellence of the mind with which Louisa’s could so ill bear a comparison, or the perfect unrivalled hold it possessed over his own.There, he had learnt to distinguish between the steadiness of principle and the obstinacy of self-will, between the darings of heedlessness and the resolution of a collected mind.There he had seen everything to exalt in his estimation the woman he had lost; and there begun to deplore the pride, the folly, the madness of resentment, which had kept him from trying to regain her when thrown in his way."
"从那时起，他一直悔恨交加。他刚刚从路易莎摔伤后最初几天的惊恐与自责中摆脱出来，刚刚开始觉得自己又有活力了，却又开始意识到自己虽有活力却失去了自由。","From that period his penance had become severe.He had no sooner been free from the horror and remorse attending the first few days of Louisa’s accident, no sooner begun to feel himself alive again, than he had begun to feel himself, though alive, not at liberty."
"“我发现，”他说，“哈维尔认为我已经订婚了！哈维尔上校和他妻子都不怀疑我们是相爱的。我感到非常吃惊。在某种程度上，我本可以马上反驳这一点。可是转念一想，别人可能也有这种想法——她的家人，也许还有她自己——于是我再也不能自己做主了。要是路易莎希望如此的话，那么我在道义上是属于她的。我太粗心了。我以前没有严肃地考虑过这个问题。我没有想到，我同她的过分亲近竟会有造成这么多不好后果的危险。我没有权利去尝试是否能够爱上两姐妹中的一个，这么做，即使不会造成别的不良影响，至少也会有引起不愉快的流言的危险。我完全错了，必须自食其果。”","“I found,” said he, “that I was considered by Harville an engaged man!That neither Harville nor his wife entertained a doubt of our mutual attachment.I was startled and shocked.To a degree, I could contradict this instantly; but, when I began to reflect that others might have felt the same—her own family, nay, perhaps herself—I was no longer at my own disposal.I was hers in honour if she wished it.I had been unguarded.I had not thought seriously on this subject before.I had not considered that my excessive intimacy must have its danger of ill consequence in many ways; and that I had no right to be trying whether I could attach myself to either of the girls, at the risk of raising even an unpleasant report, were there no other ill effects.I had been grossly wrong, and must abide the consequences.”"
"总之，他发觉得太晚了，他已经陷下去了。如果路易莎对他的感情就如哈维尔夫妇估计的那样，那么就在他完全弄清楚了自己根本不喜欢路易莎的时候，他却必须认定自己同她拴在了一起。因此，他决定离开莱姆，到别的地方等待路易莎完全康复。他非常想通过某种适当的方式来淡化路易莎对他可能有的感情和猜测，因此他去了哥哥家，打算过一段时间再回凯林奇，以便见机行事。","He found too late, in short, that he had entangled himself; and that precisely as he became fully satisfied of his not caring for Louisa at all, he must regard himself as bound to her, if her sentiments for him were what the Harvilles supposed.It determined him to leave Lyme, and await her complete recovery elsewhere.He would gladly weaken, by any fair means, whatever feelings or speculations concerning him might exist; and he went, therefore, to his brother’s, meaning after a while to return to Kellynch, and act as circumstances might require."
"“我在爱德华家呆了六个小时，”他说，“看到他很幸福。我却不能有其他的乐趣。我不配得到任何欢乐。他特别问起了你，甚至还问起你的容貌有没有发生变化。他没想到，在我眼中，你永远不会变样。”","“I was six weeks with Edward,” said he, “and saw him happy.I could have no other pleasure.I deserved none.He enquired after you very particularly; asked even if you were personally altered, little suspecting that to my eye you could never alter.”"
"安妮笑了笑，没有说话。他的这种错误是令人欣慰的，不应当受到责备。一个女人活到二十八岁，还听别人说没有失去早年的青春魅力，当然感到很高兴。不过同他以前说过的话相比，安妮更觉得这种敬意的价值不知高了多少，因为她觉得这是他炽烈的爱情恢复的后果，而不是原因。","Anne smiled, and let it pass.It was too pleasing a blunder for a reproach.It is something for a woman to be assured, in her eight-and-twentieth year, that she has not lost one charm of earlier youth; but the value of such homage was inexpressibly increased to Anne, by comparing it with former words, and feeling it to be the result, not the cause of a revival of his warm attachment."
"他一直呆在希罗普郡，为自己盲目的骄傲和错误的估计而追悔莫及，直到传来路易莎同本威克订婚这一令人吃惊的喜讯，他才一下子摆脱了同路易莎的关系。","He had remained in Shropshire, lamenting the blindness of his own pride, and the blunders of his own calculations, till at once released from Louisa by the astonishing and felicitous intelligence of her engagement with Benwick."
"“这样一来，”他说，“结束了我最糟糕的处境。现在我至少可以踏上幸福之路，我可以努力，做点什么。但是过去那样无所作为的长期等待，而且只等待不幸，这真叫人感到可怕。听到消息的五分钟后，我就说‘我星期三就要去巴斯，’而且我确实来了。我认为值得一来，而且是带着某种希望来的，这难道不是情有可原吗？你还单身。你可能还同我一样，保留着以往的感情。碰巧我又知道了一件使我受到鼓舞的事情。我从不怀疑别人爱上你，追求你，但是我确实知道你曾经拒绝过一个人，至少是条件比我好的人。我忍不住常常问自己，‘这是为了我吗？’”","“Here,” said he, “ended the worst of my state; for now I could at least put myself in the way of happiness; I could exert myself; I could do something.But to be waiting so long in inaction, and waiting only for evil, had been dreadful.Within the first five minutes I said, ‘I will be at Bath on Wednesday,’ and I was.Was it unpardonable to think it worth my while to come?and to arrive with some degree of hope?You were single.It was possible that you might retain the feelings of the past, as I did; and one encouragement happened to be mine.I could never doubt that you would be loved and sought by others, but I knew to a certainty that you had refused one man, at least, of better pretensions than myself; and I could not help often saying, ‘Was this for me?’”"
"他们在米尔萨姆街的第一次见面就有好多话可以说，而且谈到音乐会时可说的就更多了。那天晚上似乎充满了奇妙的时刻。安妮在把八宝厅走上前来跟他说话的时刻；埃利奥特先生进来把她拉走的时刻；后来又有一两次，忽而重新浮现出希望，忽而愈发感到失望。两个人兴致勃勃地谈论不停。","Their first meeting in Milsom Street afforded much to be said, but the concert still more.That evening seemed to be made up of exquisite moments.The moment of her stepping forward in the Octagon Room to speak to him: the moment of Mr. Elliot’s appearing and tearing her away, and one or two subsequent moments, marked by returning hope or increasing despondency, were dwelt on with energy."
"他大声说道：“看到你坐在一群不会对我表示好感的人中间，看到你堂兄坐在你身边，又说又笑，觉得你们才是天造地设的一对，我心中该有多么懊恼！想到这是有可能对你产生影响的每一个人的必然的愿望，对我又是种什么滋味！即使你自己的感情勉强或者冷漠，可是支持他的力量多大啊！我看上去傻乎乎的，难道这不足以愚弄我吗？我怎么能眼看着这一切而不感到痛苦呢？一看到坐在你身后的那位朋友，回想起以前曾经发生的事，深知这位朋友对你的影响，又想到她的劝说曾经造成的后果所留下的无法抹去，无法改变的印象——这一切难道不都是对我不利的吗？”","“To see you,” cried he, “in the midst of those who could not be my well-wishers; to see your cousin close by you, conversing and smiling, and feel all the horrible eligibilities and proprieties of the match!To consider it as the certain wish of every being who could hope to influence you!Even if your own feelings were reluctant or indifferent, to consider what powerful supports would be his!Was it not enough to make the fool of me which I appeared?How could I look on without agony?Was not the very sight of the friend who sat behind you, was not the recollection of what had been, the knowledge of her influence, the indelible, immoveable impression of what persuasion had once done—was it not all against me?”"
"“你早就应该看清楚了，”安妮回答道。“你现在早就不应该怀疑我了。情况大不相同了，我的年龄也大不相同了。如果说我曾经错误地听信了别人的劝导，请记住，他们的这种劝导是从安全的角度出发，不想让我承担风险。当初我听从他们的劝导，是因为我觉得那是一种责任，但是这次却无法求助于责任感。我要是嫁给一个对我冷漠的人，将会招致种种风险，违背一切责任。”","“You should have distinguished,” replied Anne.“You should not have suspected me now; the case is so different, and my age is so different.If I was wrong in yielding to persuasion once, remember that it was to persuasion exerted on the side of safety, not of risk.When I yielded, I thought it was to duty, but no duty could be called in aid here.In marrying a man indifferent to me, all risk would have been incurred, and all duty violated.”"
"“或许我早就应该这么考虑了，”他回答道，“可是我做不到。我当时还不能从对你的性格的进一步了解中得到启示。我还不能把这种了解化为行动，多年来使我痛苦的往日情感把这种了解压倒、埋葬和湮没了。我只能把你当作因听从劝导而抛弃我的人，你受别人的影响，却不肯受我的影响。我看见你同那个在痛苦年代里引导过你的人呆在一起。我没有理由认为，现在她的影响已经减弱了。此外，还应该考虑习惯的力量。”","“Perhaps I ought to have reasoned thus,” he replied, “but I could not.I could not derive benefit from the late knowledge I had acquired of your character.I could not bring it into play; it was overwhelmed, buried, lost in those earlier feelings which I had been smarting under year after year.I could think of you only as one who had yielded, who had given me up, who had been influenced by any one rather than by me.I saw you with the very person who had guided you in that year of misery.I had no reason to believe her of less authority now.The force of habit was to be added.”"
"“我本以为，”安妮说道，“我对你的态度可能使你免去许多或全部怀疑的。”","“I should have thought,” said Anne, “that my manner to yourself might have spared you much or all of this.”"
"“不，不！你的态度很可能是同别人订婚以后表现出的从容大度而已。我抱着这样的信念离开了你。但是，我还是决定要再见你。到了第二天早上，我的精神又振作了起来，我觉得我还有理由呆在这儿。”","“No, no! your manner might be only the ease which your engagement to another man would give.I left you in this belief; and yet, I was determined to see you again.My spirits rallied with the morning, and I felt that I had still a motive for remaining here.”"
"最终安妮又回到家了，一家人谁都想象不到她有多么幸福。这次谈话驱散了当天上午的所有诧异、悬念和其他所有痛苦，她带着无比幸福的心情走进家门，以致害怕这种幸福不能持久，因而又不得不去寻找那些转瞬即逝的令人担心的原因。在这种极度幸福的时刻，只要稍微严肃而愉快地思索一下，就能排除一切担忧。因此，当安妮走进自己的房间时，她已充满了欢快的心情，变得坚强而无畏了。","At last Anne was at home again, and happier than any one in that house could have conceived.All the surprise and suspense, and every other painful part of the morning dissipated by this conversation, she re-entered the house so happy as to be obliged to find an alloy in some momentary apprehensions of its being impossible to last.An interval of meditation, serious and grateful, was the best corrective of everything dangerous in such high-wrought felicity; and she went to her room, and grew steadfast and fearless in the thankfulness of her enjoyment."
"夜幕降临了，客厅里灯火辉煌，宾主聚集一堂。所谓的晚会，只不过是一次牌会，仅仅是以前少有往来的客人和常客之间的交往而已。这是一次极普通的晚会，想要进行亲密的交谈，就嫌人太多，要使活动丰富多彩，又嫌人太少。但是安妮从来没有见到过比这次更短的晚会了。她感情丰富，感到非常幸福，显得容光焕发，妩媚可爱。她受到比她想象的和期望的还要多的仰慕，而她对周围的每个人也非常亲切和宽容。埃利奥特先生也来了。安妮躲开他，但是也同情他。对于沃利斯夫妇，她为能结识他们而感到兴奋。达尔林普尔夫人和卡特雷特小姐——她们很快就会成为对她无碍的表亲了。她不去理会克莱太太，对她父亲和姐姐在公开场合的举止也没有什么可羞愧的。她与马斯格罗夫一家非常随便而愉快地闲谈着；与哈维尔上校是一种兄妹间的情真意切的交谈；她曾打算同拉塞尔夫人谈话，但是几次都被一种美妙的情感所打断；对克罗夫特将军和太太，她非常非常热诚，兴致勃勃，但是出于同样美妙的感情，她尽量加以掩饰；对于温特沃思上校，她总时不时地同他谈上一会儿，总是希望多谈几次，而且一直意识到他就在旁边。","The evening came, the drawing-rooms were lighted up, the company assembled.It was but a card party, it was but a mixture of those who had never met before, and those who met too often; a commonplace business, too numerous for intimacy, too small for variety; but Anne had never found an evening shorter.Glowing and lovely in sensibility and happiness, and more generally admired than she thought about or cared for, she had cheerful or forbearing feelings for every creature around her.Mr. Elliot was there; she avoided, but she could pity him.The Wallises, she had amusement in understanding them.Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret—they would soon be innoxious cousins to her.She cared not for Mrs. Clay, and had nothing to blush for in the public manners of her father and sister.With the Musgroves, there was the happy chat of perfect ease; with Captain Harville, the kind-hearted intercourse of brother and sister; with Lady Russell, attempts at conversation, which a delicious consciousness cut short; with Admiral and Mrs. Croft, everything of peculiar cordiality and fervent interest, which the same consciousness sought to conceal; and with Captain Wentworth, some moments of communications continually occurring, and always the hope of more, and always the knowledge of his being there."
"就在一次短暂的接触中，两人表面上在欣赏着陈列得很优美的温室植物，这时安妮说道：","It was in one of these short meetings, each apparently occupied in admiring a fine display of greenhouse plants, that she said—"
"“我一直在考虑我们过去的事情，希望能公正地判断是非，我是就我自己而言。应该说，我虽然经受了很多痛苦，但是当时我听从朋友的劝告，是正确的，是完全正确的，将来你会比现在更喜欢我的这位朋友。对于我来说，她就像是母亲一样。不过，请不要误解我。我并不是说她的劝告没有错。也许在这种情况下，劝告好坏与否，要由事态发展来决定。至于我个人，在任何类似情况下，都决不会提出这样的劝告。不过我的意思是说，我听从她的劝告是正确的，如果我不听她的劝告，那么继续保持婚约使我遭受的痛苦比结束婚约更严重，因为我会受到良心的责备。如果我们承认，在人的身上存在着这样一种情感的话，那我就没有什么可谴责自己的。如果我说错的话，那么强烈的责任感是女人一份不错的嫁妆。”","“I have been thinking over the past, and trying impartially to judge of the right and wrong, I mean with regard to myself; and I must believe that I was right, much as I suffered from it, that I was perfectly right in being guided by the friend whom you will love better than you do now.To me, she was in the place of a parent.Do not mistake me, however.I am not saying that she did not err in her advice.It was, perhaps, one of those cases in which advice is good or bad only as the event decides; and for myself, I certainly never should, in any circumstance of tolerable similarity, give such advice.But I mean, that I was right in submitting to her, and that if I had done otherwise, I should have suffered more in continuing the engagement than I did even in giving it up, because I should have suffered in my conscience.I have now, as far as such a sentiment is allowable in human nature, nothing to reproach myself with; and if I mistake not, a strong sense of duty is no bad part of a woman’s portion.”"
"温特沃思上校看看她，看看拉塞尔夫人，然后又看看她，似乎在冷静地思索，回答道：","He looked at her, looked at Lady Russell, and looking again at her, replied, as if in cool deliberation—"
"“现在我还不能原谅她。不过，今后她有希望得到宽恕。我相信我很快就会宽恕她的。不过我也在考虑过去的事情，一个问题油然而生，除了那位夫人之外，我是否可能还有另外一个敌人？那就是我自己。请你告诉我，要是我在一八零八年带着几千英镑回到英国并被派往‘拉克尼亚’号后给你写信，你会回信吗？总之，在那种情况下，你会恢复婚约吗？”","“Not yet.But there are hopes of her being forgiven in time.I trust to being in charity with her soon.But I too have been thinking over the past, and a question has suggested itself, whether there may not have been one person more my enemy even than that lady?My own self.Tell me if, when I returned to England in the year eight, with a few thousand pounds, and was posted into the Laconia, if I had then written to you, would you have answered my letter?Would you, in short, have renewed the engagement then?”"
"“我会吗！”这就是安妮的全部回答，但是语气却十分坚决。","“Would I!” was all her answer; but the accent was decisive enough."
"“仁慈的上帝！”他喊道，“你会的！倒不是我没有想到这一点，我并非不希望我的一切成就能配上这一最高奖赏。可是我的自尊心很强，太强了，不愿意再次求婚。我不理解你。我闭上了我的眼睛，不想理解你，也不想公正地看待你。想到这一点，我可以原谅任何人，就是不能原谅我自己。六年的分离和痛苦本来可以避免的。这种想法也是一种痛苦，对我来说也是一种新的痛苦。过去我总是满意地认为，我享受的一切幸福都是我挣来的。我总是自恃劳苦功高，理所当然应该得到报答。就像其他受到挫折的伟人一样，”他微笑着继续说道，“我必须使我的思想顺从命运的安排。我应该学会享受我本配不上的幸福。”","“Good God!” he cried, “you would!It is not that I did not think of it, or desire it, as what could alone crown all my other success; but I was proud, too proud to ask again.I did not understand you.I shut my eyes, and would not understand you, or do you justice.This is a recollection which ought to make me forgive every one sooner than myself.Six years of separation and suffering might have been spared.It is a sort of pain, too, which is new to me.I have been used to the gratification of believing myself to earn every blessing that I enjoyed.I have valued myself on honourable toils and just rewards.Like other great men under reverses,” he added, with a smile.“I must endeavour to subdue my mind to my fortune.I must learn to brook being happier than I deserve.”"
"第二十四章","CHAPTER 24"
"谁还会对事态的发展产生怀疑呢？无论哪对年轻人，只要他们决定结婚，肯定会坚定不移地去实现这个目标，哪怕他们很穷，或者很不明智，或者婚姻对彼此的最终幸福毫无必要。得出这样的结论或许是不道德的，但是我相信这是真理。如果这些人能够成功，那位温特沃思上校和安妮•埃利奥特小姐，思想既成熟，又有明辨是非的优点，他们之间还有一笔自主的财产，怎么会抵挡不住种种的反对意见呢？实际上，他们已经冲破的阻力远比他们遇到的多，因为除了缺少亲切与热情之外，也没有什么事情使他们苦恼。沃尔特爵士没有反对，伊丽莎白只不过看上去冷淡和漠不关心而已。温特沃思上校拥有25000镑财产，赫赫的优点与功绩使他在海军中获得了很高的职位，他已不再是小人物了。现在，人们认为他完全有资格去向一位愚蠢的、挥霍无度的准男爵的女儿求婚，何况这位准男爵无才无德，无法维持上天赋予他的地位，目前只能给予他女儿将来应该继承的一万英镑财产的一小部分。","Who can be in doubt of what followed?When any two young people take it into their heads to marry, they are pretty sure by perseverance to carry their point, be they ever so poor, or ever so imprudent, or ever so little likely to be necessary to each other’s ultimate comfort.This may be bad morality to conclude with, but I believe it to be truth; and if such parties succeed, how should a Captain Wentworth and an Anne Elliot, with the advantage of maturity of mind, consciousness of right, and one independent fortune between them, fail of bearing down every opposition?They might in fact, have borne down a great deal more than they met with, for there was little to distress them beyond the want of graciousness and warmth.Sir Walter made no objection, and Elizabeth did nothing worse than look cold and unconcerned.Captain Wentworth, with five-and-twenty thousand pounds, and as high in his profession as merit and activity could place him, was no longer nobody.He was now esteemed quite worthy to address the daughter of a foolish, spendthrift baronet, who had not had principle or sense enough to maintain himself in the situation in which Providence had placed him, and who could give his daughter at present but a small part of the share of ten thousand pounds which must be hers hereafter."
"沃尔特爵士虽然不喜欢安妮，虚荣心又没有得到满足，因而并不为这件事情真心地感到高兴，但是他确实认为这桩婚事对安妮是不错的。相反，他见到温特沃思上校的次数多了，白天反复打量他，仔细对他进行了观察，为他的相貌大为打动，觉得他那仪表堂堂的相貌确实抵得上安妮的高贵家世。这一切，再加上他那动听的姓名，最后使沃尔特爵士欣然拿起笔，在那本荣誉册中加上了这桩婚事。","Sir Walter, indeed, though he had no affection for Anne, and no vanity flattered, to make him really happy on the occasion, was very far from thinking it a bad match for her.On the contrary, when he saw more of Captain Wentworth, saw him repeatedly by daylight, and eyed him well, he was very much struck by his personal claims, and felt that his superiority of appearance might be not unfairly balanced against her superiority of rank; and all this, assisted by his well-sounding name, enabled Sir Walter at last to prepare his pen, with a very good grace, for the insertion of the marriage in the volume of honour."
"在这些亲朋好友中，只有一个人的反对可能会引起真正的焦虑，那就是拉塞尔夫人。安妮知道拉塞尔夫人在了解了埃利奥特先生的真面目并放弃他之后，不仅肯定会感到有些痛苦，而且要经过一番努力才能真正认识并公正地对待温特沃思上校。不过，拉塞尔夫人现在不得不这么做了。她必须认识到，她对两个人的判断都错了，她对两个人的外表产生了错觉。因为温特沃思上校的举止不符合她的心意，她就过早地认为他的举止反映了一种危险的鲁莽性格。因为埃利奥特先生的举止稳妥得体，彬彬有礼，善于阿谀奉承，投她所好，她就过早地把他看作是教养有素和思想成熟的必然结果。拉塞尔夫人所能做的就是承认她过去完全错了，需要接受新的观点并迎合新的希望。","The only one among them, whose opposition of feeling could excite any serious anxiety was Lady Russell.Anne knew that Lady Russell must be suffering some pain in understanding and relinquishing Mr. Elliot, and be making some struggles to become truly acquainted with, and do justice to Captain Wentworth.This however was what Lady Russell had now to do.She must learn to feel that she had been mistaken with regard to both; that she had been unfairly influenced by appearances in each; that because Captain Wentworth’s manners had not suited her own ideas, she had been too quick in suspecting them to indicate a character of dangerous impetuosity; and that because Mr. Elliot’s manners had precisely pleased her in their propriety and correctness, their general politeness and suavity, she had been too quick in receiving them as the certain result of the most correct opinions and well-regulated mind.There was nothing less for Lady Russell to do, than to admit that she had been pretty completely wrong, and to take up a new set of opinions and of hopes."
"有些人观察力敏锐，善于识别人的性格，具有天然的洞察力，总之，其他人的经验是无法与之相比的，拉塞尔夫人在这方面的悟性远远没有她的年轻朋友有天赋。不过她是一个非常善良的女性，如果说她的第二目标是通情达理和明确判断，那么她的第一目标便是看着安妮能够得到幸福。她爱安妮胜过爱自己的才能。当最初的尴尬消失之后，她就发现，她可以毫不困难地像母亲一样来对待那个能保证她心爱的孩子得到幸福的孩子。","There is a quickness of perception in some, a nicety in the discernment of character, a natural penetration, in short, which no experience in others can equal, and Lady Russell had been less gifted in this part of understanding than her young friend.But she was a very good woman, and if her second object was to be sensible and well-judging, her first was to see Anne happy.She loved Anne better than she loved her own abilities; and when the awkwardness of the beginning was over, found little hardship in attaching herself as a mother to the man who was securing the happiness of her other child."
"在一家人里，或许只有玛丽才会对这件事情感到最为满意。有个姐姐要结婚是光荣的，她还得意地认为是她秋天把安妮留在家里，才有力地促成了这桩婚事。因为她自己的姐姐要比丈夫的妹妹好，她十分乐意地认为温特沃思上校比本威克舰长和查尔斯•海特都富有。或许，当他们再次相会时，看到安妮又恢复了优先权，成为一个很漂亮的四轮马车的女主人时，她心里会有些难过，但是她可以聊以自慰的是，她可以寄希望于未来。安妮没有阿珀克罗斯大宅，没有地产，不可能当一家之主。只要不让温特沃思上校当上准男爵，她是不愿意与安妮换个位置的。","Of all the family, Mary was probably the one most immediately gratified by the circumstance.It was creditable to have a sister married, and she might flatter herself with having been greatly instrumental to the connexion, by keeping Anne with her in the autumn; and as her own sister must be better than her husband’s sisters, it was very agreeable that Captain Wentworth should be a richer man than either Captain Benwick or Charles Hayter.She had something to suffer, perhaps, when they came into contact again, in seeing Anne restored to the rights of seniority, and the mistress of a very pretty landaulette; but she had a future to look forward to, of powerful consolation.Anne had no Uppercross Hall before her, no landed estate, no headship of a family; and if they could but keep Captain Wentworth from being made a baronet, she would not change situations with Anne."
"要是大姐伊丽莎白对她的处境同样满意就好了，因为不大可能再发生什么变化了。不久她就痛苦地看着埃利奥特先生离开了，从此再也没有出现一个有相当地位的人来唤起哪怕是与埃利奥特先生一同消逝的那种渺茫的希望。","It would be well for the eldest sister if she were equally satisfied with her situation, for a change is not very probable there.She had soon the mortification of seeing Mr. Elliot withdraw, and no one of proper condition has since presented himself to raise even the unfounded hopes which sunk with him."
"埃利奥特先生听到他堂妹安妮订婚的消息，感到十分意外。这打乱了他建立幸福家庭的美好设想，打破了他利用女婿的权利来监视沃尔特爵士，让他不再做续娶的美梦。不过，他虽然受到了挫折，感到失望，但还能为维护自己的利益和享受而做些事情。他很快便离开了巴斯。过了不久，克莱太太也走了，人们后来听说克莱太太在伦敦做了他的姘头。显而易见，埃利奥特先生过去如何一直在玩弄两面手法，他如何下定决心，不让一个狡猾的女人毁了自己的继承权。","The news of his cousins Anne’s engagement burst on Mr. Elliot most unexpectedly.It deranged his best plan of domestic happiness, his best hope of keeping Sir Walter single by the watchfulness which a son-in-law’s rights would have given.But, though discomfited and disappointed, he could still do something for his own interest and his own enjoyment.He soon quitted Bath; and on Mrs. Clay’s quitting it soon afterwards, and being next heard of as established under his protection in London, it was evident how double a game he had been playing, and how determined he was to save himself from being cut out by one artful woman, at least."
"克莱太太的感情压倒了她的利益，为了这个年轻人，她放弃了进一步施展阴谋去征服沃尔特爵士的计划。不过，她有感情，也有能力，所以目前还难以确定他们俩究竟谁的狡猾会占上风。埃利奥特先生虽阻止她成为沃尔特爵士的妻子，不知道他自己是否会被连哄带骗地最终娶她做威廉爵士夫人。","Mrs. Clay’s affections had overpowered her interest, and she had sacrificed, for the young man’s sake, the possibility of scheming longer for Sir Walter.She has abilities, however, as well as affections; and it is now a doubtful point whether his cunning, or hers, may finally carry the day; whether, after preventing her from being the wife of Sir Walter, he may not be wheedled and caressed at last into making her the wife of Sir William."
"毫无疑问，沃尔特爵士和伊丽莎白失去这一伙伴、发现她欺骗了他们后，感到非常震惊和羞愧。当然，他们可以到高贵的表亲那里寻求安慰，但是他们总也一定感到，总是去奉承和迎合别人，却没有人来奉承和迎合自己，那只有一半的乐趣。","It cannot be doubted that Sir Walter and Elizabeth were shocked and mortified by the loss of their companion, and the discovery of their deception in her.They had their great cousins, to be sure, to resort to for comfort; but they must long feel that to flatter and follow others, without being flattered and followed in turn, is but a state of half enjoyment."
"早在拉塞尔夫人刚刚打算要像她应该做的那样去爱护温特沃思上校时，安妮就感到大为满意。她对自己未来的幸福生活没有遗憾，只是感到无法为温特沃思上校提供一个通情达理的人所能珍惜的亲戚。在这一方面，安妮感到十分自卑。财产上的差距没什么，她对此倒一点都不感到遗憾。但是家里人不能恰当地对待和评价温特沃思上校，没有尊重，没有和谐也没有善意，无以报答安妮从温特沃思上校兄弟姐妹那里受到的重视和诚心诚意的欢迎。这是安妮深感切肤之痛的根源，否则她会感到异常幸福的。在这个世界上，安妮只能给温特沃思上校的朋友圈增加两个人：拉塞尔夫人和史密斯太太。不过，他倒是很愿意同他们两个交往。尽管拉塞尔夫人以前有过这样那样的过失，但是他却能真心实意地敬重她。他除了不能说拉塞尔夫人过去将他们拆散是正确的以外，在其他方面，他几乎愿意处处替她说好话。至于史密斯太太，她有种种长处，很快就能赢得他永久的好感。","Anne, satisfied at a very early period of Lady Russell’s meaning to love Captain Wentworth as she ought, had no other alloy to the happiness of her prospects than what arose from the consciousness of having no relations to bestow on him which a man of sense could value.There she felt her own inferiority very keenly.The disproportion in their fortune was nothing; it did not give her a moment’s regret; but to have no family to receive and estimate him properly, nothing of respectability, of harmony, of good will to offer in return for all the worth and all the prompt welcome which met her in his brothers and sisters, was a source of as lively pain as her mind could well be sensible of under circumstances of otherwise strong felicity.She had but two friends in the world to add to his list, Lady Russell and Mrs. Smith.To those, however, he was very well disposed to attach himself.Lady Russell, in spite of all her former transgressions, he could now value from his heart.While he was not obliged to say that he believed her to have been right in originally dividing them, he was ready to say almost everything else in her favour, and as for Mrs. Smith, she had claims of various kinds to recommend her quickly and permanently."
"史密斯太太不久前对安妮做了足够多的好事，他们的婚姻不仅没有使她失去一个朋友，反而使她有了两个好友。她是他们定居以后的第一个来访者。温特沃思上校不仅为她收回她丈夫在西印度群岛的财产出点子，还为她写信，为她四处奔走，帮她闯过一道道具体而琐碎的难关，他以一个无所畏惧的坚定朋友的奔走与努力，充分报答了史密斯太太过去给予的或者打算给予他妻子的帮助。","Her recent good offices by Anne had been enough in themselves, and their marriage, instead of depriving her of one friend, secured her two.She was their earliest visitor in their settled life; and Captain Wentworth, by putting her in the way of recovering her husband’s property in the West Indies, by writing for her, acting for her, and seeing her through all the petty difficulties of the case with the activity and exertion of a fearless man and a determined friend, fully requited the services which she had rendered, or ever meant to render, to his wife."
"史密斯太太的收入增加了，健康状况好转了，又赢得了这些经常往来的朋友，因为她并没有丧失快乐和爽朗的性格。只要她保持这些主要的美德，她甚至可以藐视更多的荣华富贵。她即使家财万贯，非常健康，也仍会感到幸福。她的幸福来源于她热烈的情绪，就像她朋友安妮的幸福来源于她热情的内心。安妮十分温柔，完全赢得了温特沃思上校的钟情。只有他的职业才使得安妮的朋友希望她不要那么温柔，唯恐将来的战争会使她的快乐黯然失色。她为做一个水兵的妻子而感到自豪，但是她必须为属于这一职业而付出担惊受怕的代价。如果可能的话，这种职业在家庭中的重要性比在国家中的重要性更为显著。","Mrs. Smith’s enjoyments were not spoiled by this improvement of income, with some improvement of health, and the acquisition of such friends to be often with, for her cheerfulness and mental alacrity did not fail her; and while these prime supplies of good remained, she might have bid defiance even to greater accessions of worldly prosperity.She might have been absolutely rich and perfectly healthy, and yet be happy.Her spring of felicity was in the glow of her spirits, as her friend Anne’s was in the warmth of her heart.Anne was tenderness itself, and she had the full worth of it in Captain Wentworth’s affection.His profession was all that could ever make her friends wish that tenderness less, the dread of a future war all that could dim her sunshine.She gloried in being a sailor’s wife, but she must pay the tax of quick alarm for belonging to that profession which is, if possible, more distinguished in its domestic virtues than in its national importance."
