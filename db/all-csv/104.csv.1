"篝火旁的纽约","New York by Campfire Light"
"欧·亨利", "by O. Henry"
"在遥远的克里克族部落的驻地，我们听闻到一些关于纽约的事情。","Away out in the Creek Nation we learned things about New York."
"我们参加了一次狩猎旅行，一天夜里在一条小河边扎了营。巴德·金斯伯里是我们的向导，同时也是一名经验丰富的猎手，正是从他嘴里，我们了解到曼哈顿和居住在那里的古怪居民。巴德去过那个大都市，一次是住了一个月，还有几次是住了一两周，他很乐于向我们讲述他在那里的见闻。","We were on a hunting trip, and were camped one night on the bank of a little stream.Bud Kingsbury was our skilled hunter and guide, and it was from his lips that we had explanations of Manhattan and the queer folks that inhabit it.Bud had once spent a month in the metropolis, and a week or two at other times, and he was pleased to discourse to us of what he had seen."
"在离我们营地五十码的地方，流浪的一家子印第安人搭起圆锥形帐篷，准备今晚在那儿过夜。一位很老很老的印第安妇人正试着给挂在三根支架上的铁锅生火。","Fifty yards away from our camp was pitched the teepee of a wandering family of Indians that had come up and settled there for the night.An old, old Indian woman was trying to build a fire under an iron pot hung upon three sticks."
"巴德跑过去帮忙，火很快就生起来了。他回来后，我们调侃他很会讨女人欢心。","Bud went over to her assistance, and soon had her fire going.When he came back we complimented him playfully upon his gallantry."
"“哎，”巴德说，“不值一提。这就是我做事的方式。每当我看到女士设法用锅做饭而遇见麻烦时，我总会伸出援手。在纽约城的一处高级住宅里我也曾做过同样的事。在第五大街上堆起大的社区帐篷。刚才那个印第安妇人有点儿让我回想起当时的情景。是的，我总是竭力做到彬彬有礼，并乐于帮助女士们摆脱困境。”","“Oh,” said Bud, “don’t mention it.It’s a way I have.Whenever I see a lady trying to cook things in a pot and having trouble I always go to the rescue.I done the same thing once in a high-toned house in New York City.Heap big society teepee on Fifth Avenue.That Injun lady kind of recalled it to my mind.Yes, I endeavours to be polite and help the ladies out.”"
"宿营的人们都想听听细节。","The camp demanded the particulars."
"“我当时是锅柄州（美国西弗吉尼亚州的别称）三角B牧场的经理，”巴德说，“那牧场的老板是纽约一个姓斯特林的老头。他想把牧场出售，于是就写信让我去纽约，向有意收购的财团介绍牧场情况。于是，我去了沃思堡，花了四十美元做了套衣服，然后上路去纽约。","“I was manager of the Triangle B Ranch in the Panhandle,” said Bud.“It was owned at that time by old man Sterling, of New York.He wanted to sell out, and he wrote for me to come on to New York and explain the ranch to the syndicate that wanted to buy.So I sends to Fort Worth and has a forty dollar suit of clothes made, and hits the trail for the big village."
"“呃，当我到那里的时候，斯特林老头和他手下一班人已经把一切都安排妥善了。我们将娱乐和生意合为一体，以致于你经常会分不清这到底是款待还是在做生意。我们坐电车参观整个都市，抽雪茄，上剧院，开观光聚会。”","“Well, when I got there, old man Sterling and his outfit certainly laid themselves out to be agreeable.We had business and pleasure so mixed up that you couldn’t tell whether it was a treat or a trade half the time.We had trolley rides, and cigars, and theatre round-ups, and rubber parties.”"
"“观光聚会？”听众中有人问道。","“Rubber parties?” said a listener, inquiringly."
"“是啊，”巴德答道，“你们都没参加过吗？就是到处逛逛并试着观望摩天大楼的楼顶。呃，我们把牧场卖了，就在我启程回家的前一晚，斯特林老头请我去他家吃了个便饭。没太大排场——也就是我、他、他老婆和女儿。但是他们衣着得体，也没有意外来客。相比之下，给我做衣服的沃思堡的裁缝简直就像贩卖遮羞布和马毯马具的小贩。桌上摆满了鲜花，奢华而铺张，每个人盘子边都摆着一整套餐具。你会认为好像要用这些工具将餐厅的门撬开然后才能吃到食物似的。还好我在纽约也住了一个多星期了，多少了解了一些追赶潮流的方式。我有点儿放慢了动作，观察其他人是怎么用这些金属餐具的，然后模仿他们，用手里相同的家伙对付美食。当你懂得了上层人士的节奏后，跟上他们的步子并不难。我学得不错。感觉挺好，不久之后，我就用一种令人愉悦且流利的语调和他们侃侃而谈，向他们讲述牧场和西部的故事，告诉他们印第安人是怎么吃炖蚂蚱和蛇的，你从未见过有谁会听得如此津津有味。","“Sure,” said Bud.“Didn’t you never attend ’em?You walk around and try to look at the tops of the skyscrapers.Well, we sold the ranch, and old man Sterling asks me ‘round to his house to take grub on the night before I started back.It wasn’t any high-collared affair—just me and the old man and his wife and daughter.But they was a fine-haired outfit all right, and the lilies of the field wasn’t in it.They made my Fort Worth clothes carpenter look like a dealer in horse blankets and gee strings.And then the table was all pompous with flowers, and there was a whole kit of tools laid out beside everybody’s plate.You’d have thought you was fixed out to burglarize a restaurant before you could get your grub.But I’d been in New York over a week then, and I was getting on to stylish ways.I kind of trailed behind and watched the others use the hardware supplies, and then I tackled the chuck with the same weapons.It ain’t much trouble to travel with the high-flyers after you find out their gait.I got along fine.I was feeling cool and agreeable, and pretty soon I was talking away fluent as you please, all about the ranch and the West, and telling ’em how the Indians eat grasshopper stew and snakes, and you never saw people so interested."
"“但是，酒席上真正让人的欣喜的还是斯特林小姐。她是个娇小的姑娘，与二十五美分一块的橡皮糖相比，大不了多少；但她有种气质，似乎说明她非比寻常，而且你也对此会深信不疑。不过，她从来不摆架子，当我说到克里克族的狗肉宴的时候，她微笑地看着我，好像看着一个百万富翁，她的表情就像是在听来自家乡的消息。","“But the real joy of that feast was that Miss Sterling.Just a little trick she was, not bigger than two bits’ worth of chewing plug; but she had a way about her that seemed to say she was the people, and you believed it.And yet, she never put on any airs, and she smiled at me the same as if I was a millionaire while I was telling about a Creek dog feast and listened like it was news from home."
"“随后，我们吃了牡蛎，喝了清汤，品尝了些我从未品尝过的佳肴，一个卫理公会模样打扮的牧师端着个便携营地炉似的东西进来，那东西是全银制的，有着长长的支架，下面还有一盏灯。","“By and by, after we had eat oysters and some watery soup and truck that never was in my repertory, a Methodist preacher brings in a kind of camp stove arrangement, all silver, on long legs, with a lamp under it."
"“斯特林小姐把灯点着，然后开始在餐桌上烹饪起来。我纳闷的是，斯特林老头那么有钱，为什么不雇一个厨师来干这活。不一小会儿，她就端出一些说是兔子的奶酪味的菜，但是我敢发誓，纽约一英里之内都找不出这么一只名叫莫莉的白尾棕兔来。","“Miss Sterling lights up and begins to do some cooking right on the supper table.I wondered why old man Sterling didn’t hire a cook, with all the money he had.Pretty soon she dished out some cheesy tasting truck that she said was rabbit, but I swear there had never been a Molly cotton tail in a mile of it."
"“最后上来的是柠檬汁。是盛在一个平板的小玻璃碗里，放在你盘子边的。我当时渴极了，端起自己的碗就灌了一大口。那位小姐刚好在这里犯了点儿错误。她虽然放对了柠檬，但是忘记了加糖。再好的管家也有疏忽的时候。我想斯特林小姐可能刚刚开始学着管理家务和做饭——那道什么兔子的菜肯定会让你产生这样的想法——我对自己说‘小姐，不管加不加糖，我都支持你。’然后又端起我的碗，把里面的柠檬汁喝得一滴都不剩。然后，席间的其他人也端起他们的碗，按我的样子做了。之后，我故意逗斯特林小姐笑，就使这件事像一个笑话一样被一笑了之，从而使她不会为自己的失误感到窘迫不安。","“The last thing on the programme was lemonade.It was brought around in little flat glass bowls and set by your plate.I was pretty thirsty, and I picked up mine and took a big swig of it.Right there was where the little lady had made a mistake.She had put in the lemon all right, but she’d forgot the sugar.The best housekeepers slip up sometimes.I thought maybe Miss Sterling was just learning to keep house and cook—that rabbit would surely make you think so—and I says to myself, ‘Little lady, sugar or no sugar I’ll stand by you,’ and I raises up my bowl again and drinks the last drop of the lemonade.And then all the balance of ’em picks up their bowls and does the same.And then I gives Miss Sterling the laugh proper, just to carry it off like a joke, so she wouldn’t feel bad about the mistake."
"“饭后我们都到了起居室，她坐下和我聊了一会儿。","“After we all went into the sitting room she sat down and talked to me quite a while."
"“‘您可真是太友好了，金斯伯里先生，’她说，‘如此漂亮地掩盖了我的过失。我可真笨，居然忘记放糖。’","“‘It was so kind of you, Mr. Kingsbury,’ says she, ‘to bring my blunder off so nicely.It was so stupid of me to forget the sugar.’"
"“‘不用客气，’我答道，‘总有一天会有个幸运的家伙在不远处用他的套马索套住这个非常优雅的小管家。’","“‘Never you mind,’ says I, ‘some lucky man will throw his rope over a mighty elegant little housekeeper some day, not far from here.’"
"“‘金斯伯里先生，要是你说的是我的话，’她大声地笑着说，‘我希望他能向你一样可以容忍我这个不称职的管家。’","“‘If you mean me, Mr. Kingsbury,’ says she, laughing out loud, ‘I hope he will be as lenient with my poor housekeeping as you have been.’"
"“‘不用客气，’我答道，‘乐意为女士效劳。’”","“‘Don’t mention it,’ says I.‘Anything to oblige the ladies.’”"
"巴德结束了他的回忆。有人就问他，认为纽约人最显著的特点是什么。","Bud ceased his reminiscences.And then some one asked him what he considered the most striking and prominent trait of New Yorkers."
"“纽约人最显著的特点，”他回答说，“就是纽约。他们脑子里装着的就是纽约。他们也听说过其他一些地方，像韦科、巴黎、温泉城，还有伦敦；但是他们对此都不屑一顾。他们认为纽约遍地都是美利奴羊。我给你们讲个我还在三角B牧场干活时候的故事，让你们看看他们有多在乎他们的城市。有个纽约人，到处流浪，直到有一次跑到我干活的地方。","“The most visible and peculiar trait of New York folks,” answered Bud, “is New York.Most of ’em has New York on the brain.They have heard of other places, such as Waco, and Paris, and Hot Springs, and London; but they don’t believe in ’em.They think that town is all Merino.Now to show you how much they care for their village I’ll tell you about one of ’em that strayed out as far as the Triangle B while I was working there."
"“这个纽约人想来牧场谋个差事。他说他精通骑术，而且他身上还沾着些许骑术学校的树皮屑。","“This New Yorker come out there looking for a job on the ranch.He said he was a good horseback rider, and there was pieces of tanbark hanging on his clothes yet from his riding school."
"“呃，刚开始，因为他精通算术，于是就安排他暂时到牧场商店的账房干活。但他不久就厌倦了，要求换一个有激情的活干干。牧场弟兄们虽然很喜欢他，但是他总是吹嘘纽约这一点让我们很反感。每天晚上他都要来和我们说说纽约的东江、J. P. 摩根、伊登博物馆、赫特·格林，还有中央公园，一直会逼到我们厌烦地向他丢铁皮盘子和烙铁块为止。","“Well, for a while they put him to keeping books in the ranch store, for he was a devil at figures.But he got tired of that, and asked for something more in the line of activity.The boys on the ranch liked him all right, but he made us tired shouting New York all the time.Every night he’d tell us about East River and J. P. Morgan and the Eden Musee and Hetty Green and Central Park till we used to throw tin plates and branding irons at him."
"“一天，这家伙跨上一匹矮种马的马背，马侧身去吃一边的草，那纽约人就摔了下来。","“One day this chap gets on a pitching pony, and the pony kind of sidled up his back and went to eating grass while the New Yorker was coming down."
"“他摔下来的时候，脑袋磕在牧豆树的树桩上，看起来没有能再站起来的希望。我们把他抬到帐篷里，眼看着他就要断气了。于是吉迪恩·皮斯飞快地备好了马，风驰电掣地去三十英里外的道格镇找斯利珀大夫。","“He come down on his head on a chunk of mesquit wood, and he didn’t show any designs toward getting up again.We laid him out in a tent, and he begun to look pretty dead.So Gideon Pease saddles up and burns the wind for old Doc Sleeper’s residence in Dogtown, thirty miles away."
"“大夫来了，检查了一下伤员。","“The doctor comes over and he investigates the patient."
"“‘伙计们，’他说，‘你们倒不如赌上一把，赢了的就拿走他的马鞍和衣服，他颅骨骨折，要是还能再挺十分钟的话，就是破了长寿史上的记录了。’","“‘Boys,’ says he, ‘you might as well go to playing seven-up for his saddle and clothes, for his head’s fractured and if he lives ten minutes it will be a remarkable case of longevity.’"
"“我们当然不会赌这自大的可怜虫的马鞍——医生只是开个玩笑罢了。但是我们心情沉重地围着他站着，原谅了他整天纽约纽约的唠叨个没完，把我们烦得要死这一举止。","“Of course we didn’t gamble for the poor rooster’s saddle—that was one of Doc’s jokes.But we stood around feeling solemn, and all of us forgive him for having talked us to death about New York."
"“我从来没见过临终前像这个家伙一样安详的人。他的眼睛直勾勾地盯着上方，嘴里胡乱说着什么动听的音乐啊，美丽的街道啊，穿白色长袍的人啊，他微笑着，似乎死亡是人生一大乐事。","“I never saw anybody about to hand in his checks act more peaceful than this fellow.His eyes were fixed ’way up in the air, and he was using rambling words to himself all about sweet music and beautiful streets and white-robed forms, and he was smiling like dying was a pleasure."
"“‘他快升天了，’大夫说，‘当人开始觉得看见天堂了的时候，他也就活不成了。’","“‘He’s about gone now,’ said Doc.‘Whenever they begin to think they see heaven it’s all off.’"
"“听医生这么一说，那纽约人好像不坐起来就要受到谴责似的，忽的坐了起来。","“Blamed if that New York man didn’t sit right up when he heard the Doc say that."
"“‘哎，’他有些失望地说，‘那就是天堂？妈的，我还以为是百老汇大街呢。你们谁帮我把衣服拿来。我要起来。’”","“‘Say,’ says he, kind of disappointed, ‘was that heaven?Confound it all, I thought it was Broadway.Some of you fellows get my clothes.I’m going to get up.’"
"“我发誓，”巴德最后说，“四天后，他就揣了张去纽约的火车票在口袋里，上火车走了！”","“And I’ll be blamed,” concluded Bud, “if he wasn’t on the train with a ticket for New York in his pocket four days afterward!”"
