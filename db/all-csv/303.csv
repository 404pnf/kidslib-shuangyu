"第一章 诸多德瓦卢瓦骑士中的一位","CHAPTER I ONE OF MANY CHEVALIERS DE VALOIS"
"在法国的一些外省，大多数人都曾遇到过一些叫德瓦卢瓦骑士的人。曾有一位德瓦卢瓦骑士居住在诺曼底，一位居住在布尔日，还有一位闻名于阿郎松（我们主要谈这位），毫无疑问在法国南部还有其他的叫德瓦卢瓦骑士。然而，至于瓦卢瓦部族有多少人，与我们现在所要说的故事无关。在这些骑士中，肯定有一些是瓦卢瓦部族的人，正如路易十四是波旁家族的人一样。而这些骑士彼此都不大认识，因此不宜和其中一位谈起其他的骑士。这些骑士们都乐于让波旁家族安安稳稳地掌控法国的王位，因为作为奥尔良家族中第一分支的瓦卢瓦家族没有子嗣来继承王位，所以让亨利四世登上王位也是顺理成章的。而现在但凡有个姓瓦卢瓦的人，其祖先都是查理九世和玛丽·图谢之子——安古莱姆公爵，查理·德瓦卢瓦。据说从查理·德瓦卢瓦开始断了子嗣，直到后来在德罗特兰神父身上找到了相反的证据，才弄清真相。","Most persons have encountered, in certain provinces in France, a number of Chevaliers de Valois.One lived in Normandy, another at Bourges, a third (with whom we have here to do) flourished in Alencon, and doubtless the South possesses others.The number of the Valesian tribe is, however, of no consequence to the present tale.All these chevaliers, among whom were doubtless some who were Valois as Louis XIV. was Bourbon, knew so little of one another that it was not advisable to speak to one about the others.They were all willing to leave the Bourbons in tranquil possession of the throne of France; for it was too plainly established that Henri IV. became king for want of a male heir in the first Orleans branch called the Valois.If there are any Valois, they descend from Charles de Valois, Duc d’Angouleme, son of Charles IX. and Marie Touchet, the male line from whom ended, until proof to the contrary be produced, in the person of the Abbe de Rothelin."
"瓦卢瓦—圣雷米家族是亨利二世的后代，这一家族到了拉莫特—瓦卢瓦手里，也断了子嗣。这个拉莫特—瓦卢瓦因牵涉到“钻石项链事件”而臭名昭著。如果消息可靠的话，那上述这些骑士中的每一位都和阿郎松的瓦卢瓦骑士一样，是个高瘦、干瘪、囊中羞涩的老贵族。布尔日的那位骑士已流亡国外，都兰的那位则销声匿迹，阿郎松的那位在旺代地区打过仗，算是个“舒昂党”。这位阿郎松骑士的青年时代是在巴黎度过的。在他三十而立、风华正茂、情场得意之时，却突然爆发了法国大革命。外省的高等贵族都承认他是一位真正的瓦卢瓦家族骑士。而他也与其他同姓的人一样，举止优雅、超凡脱俗，表明自己是个出身高贵之人。他每日都在外面吃饭，每晚都要玩牌赌博。他有一个小缺点，就是喜欢大谈特谈关于路易十五统治时代和大革命初期的各类传闻轶事；而正因为这点，人们都认为他很机智风趣。人们第一次听到这些小故事的时候，都会觉得他讲得非常生动。并且，这位瓦卢瓦骑士最大的优点就是说瓦式俏皮话从不重复，也从来不会谈起自己的情史，但他的笑容和装腔作势的姿态则泄露出令人欢欣的秘密。这位可敬的先生享有伏尔泰贵族的特权，从不去教堂做弥撒。而由于他对于王室事业的忠诚，人们也就格外纵容他漠视宗教的行为了。他特别有风度的一个优雅动作，就是从他的金色鼻烟盒里取鼻烟的姿态（肯定是模仿莫尔的）。那鼻烟盒上面装饰着戈里扎公主的肖像，她是一位充满魅力的匈牙利公主，在路易十五统治末期以美貌而闻名。他年轻时曾迷恋过这位大名鼎鼎的异域名媛，如今谈起她时仍感触颇深。为了她，他还与德洛赞先生决斗过。如今他已经五十八岁了，却只承认自己五十岁。而他的清瘦干瘪的身材也确实当得起这无伤大雅的谎言。因为清瘦之人天生就具有许多长处，其中之一便是让人显得年轻，不论是男人还是女人。这位瓦卢瓦骑士就仍保有他年轻的身段。对了，记住这点：全部生命力，或者说所有表现生命力的优雅姿态，都在于身材。骑士拥有的其他宝贵财富还必须要算上造物主赋予他的大鼻子。他的鼻子将他苍白的脸截然分成两部分，这两部分似乎毫无联系。在进行消化工作的时候，半边脸发红，而另半边脸仍是苍白的。在生理学着重研究人类心脏的时代，这件事就很值得一提。火热的部分（就这样描述吧）是在他面部的左侧。虽然德瓦卢瓦先生双腿细长、体形瘦削、皮肤苍白，看上去好像身体不怎么健康，但却食量惊人。他声称自己患有外省所谓的“肝热”病，也许是为了给自己奇大的胃口找个借口吧。单单半边脸发红的情况算是能证实他的说法，但是在一个一顿饭包含三十或四十道菜、时间长达四小时的地方，骑士的胃似乎是上天给予阿郎松这座城市的赏赐。根据某些医生的说法，左脸发热意味着人心轻浮。骑士的风流艳史证实了这一科学论断，幸好史学家不用对这些论断负责。尽管有这些症状，德瓦卢瓦先生依然精力充沛，必是长命之人。如果他的“肝火旺”，用一句老话说，他的心火也不会弱。虽然他的脸上已经有了皱纹，头发也已花白，但是有眼力的人应该能立刻看出激情留下的痕迹和因欢愉而产生的皱纹，这些出现在眼角的鱼尾纹和出现在额头上的“宫殿台阶”皱纹在西岱尔宫中是很受赏识的。关于这位高雅骑士的一切都显示出他是一位“讨女人喜欢的男人”。他对待梳洗细致入微，以至于他的双颊令人赏心悦目，仿佛在仙水中浸洗过一般。他那头发遮盖不住的光头部分有如象牙般闪闪发亮。他的眉毛和他的头发一样，都是受到定期精心梳理的，显得很年轻。他本来就很白的皮肤似乎用了什么密招，变得更加白皙了。即使不用香水，骑士身上也散发出一种青春的芳香，令周围的空气变得清爽。他那双绅士的手保养得如同漂亮女士的手一般，修剪整齐红润的指甲引人注目。总之，要不是那个奇大的鼻子，人们会觉得他长得有点过分精致了。","The Valois-Saint-Remy, who descended from Henri II., also came to an end in the famous Lamothe-Vois implicated in the affair of the Diamond Necklace.Each of these many chevaliers, if we may believe reports, was, like the Chevalier of Alencon, an old gentleman, tall, thin, withered, and moneyless.He of Bourges had emigrated; he of Touraine hid himself; he of Alencon fought in La Vendee and “chouanized” somewhat.The youth of the latter was spend in Paris, where the Revolution overtook him when thirty years of age in the midst of his conquests and gallantries.The Chevalier de Valois of Alencon was accepted by the highest aristocracy of the province as a genuine Valois; and he distinguished himself, like the rest of his homonyms, by excellent manners, which proved him a man of society.He dined out every day, and played cards every evening.He was thought witty, thanks to his foible for relating a quantity of anecdotes on the reign of Louis XV. and the beginnings of the Revolution.When these tales were heard for the first time, they were held to be well narrated.He had, moreover, the great merit of not repeating his personal bons mots and of never speaking of his love-affairs, though his smiles and his airs and graces were delightfully indiscreet.The worthy gentleman used his privilege as a Voltairean noble to stay away from mass; and great indulgence was shown to his irreligion because of his devotion to the royal cause.One of his particular graces was the air and manner (imitated, no doubt, from Mole) with which he took snuff from a gold box adorned with the portrait of the Princess Goritza,—a charming Hungarian, celebrated for her beauty in the last years of the reign of Louis XV. Having been attached during his youth to that illustrious stranger, he still mentioned her with emotion.For her sake he had fought a duel with Monsieur de Lauzun.The chevalier, now fifty-eight years of age, owned to only fifty; and he might well allow himself that innocent deception, for, among the other advantages granted to fair thin persons, he managed to preserve the still youthful figure which saves men as well as women from an appearance of old age.Yes, remember this: all of life, or rather all the elegance that expresses life, is in the figure.Among the chevalier’s other possessions must be counted an enormous nose with which nature had endowed him.This nose vigorously divided a pale face into two sections which seemed to have no knowledge of each other, for one side would redden under the process of digestion, while the other continued white.This fact is worthy of remark at a period when physiology is so busy with the human heart.The incandescence, so to call it, was on the left side.Though his long slim legs, supporting a lank body, and his pallid skin, were not indicative of health, Monsieur de Valois ate like an ogre and declared he had a malady called in the provinces “hot liver,” perhaps to excuse his monstrous appetite.The circumstance of his singular flush confirmed this declaration; but in a region where repasts are developed on the line of thirty or forty dishes and last four hours, the chevalier’s stomach would seem to have been a blessing bestowed by Providence on the good town of Alencon.According to certain doctors, heat on the left side denotes a prodigal heart.The chevalier’s gallantries confirmed this scientific assertion, the responsibility for which does not rest, fortunately, on the historian.In spite of these symptoms, Monsieur de Valois’ constitution was vigorous, consequently long-lived.If his liver “heated,” to use an old-fashioned word, his heart was not less inflammable.His face was wrinkled and his hair silvered; but an intelligent observer would have recognized at once the stigmata of passion and the furrows of pleasure which appeared in the crow’s-feet and the marches-du-palais, so prized at the court of Cythera.Everything about this dainty chevalier bespoke the “ladies’ man.”He was so minute in his ablutions that his cheeks were a pleasure to look upon; they seemed to have been laved in some miraculous water.The part of his skull which his hair refused to cover shone like ivory.His eyebrows, like his hair, affected youth by the care and regularity with which they were combed.His skin, already white, seemed to have been extra-whitened by some secret compound.Without using perfumes, the chevalier exhaled a certain fragrance of youth, that refreshed the atmosphere.His hands, which were those of a gentleman, and were cared for like the hands of a pretty woman, attracted the eye to their rosy, well-shaped nails.In short, had it not been for his magisterial and stupendous nose, the chevalier might have been thought a trifle too dainty."
"在此，我们必须承认一件小事，逼迫自己破坏这个肖像。骑士的耳朵里塞了棉花，耳朵上挂着两个小耳环，是钻石制成的黑人头像，做工十分精细。他一直保留着这副耳环，还说自从打了耳洞之后就不再头痛了（他曾经患头痛病）。我们并不是说这位骑士是完美之人，但是，在这样一位心脏将大量血液输送到左脸的老光棍身上，人们或许会从他某些神圣的秘史中发现这些可人的品质，对此我们当然能够宽容以待。","We must here compel ourselves to spoil this portrait by the avowal of a littleness.The chevalier put cotton in his ears, and wore, appended to them, two little ear-rings representing negroes’ heads in diamonds, of admirable workmanship.He clung to these singular appendages, explaining that since his ears had been bored he had ceased to have headaches (he had had headaches).We do not present the chevalier as an accomplished man; but surely we can pardon, in an old celibate whose heart sends so much blood to his left cheek, these adorable qualities, founded, perhaps, on some sublime secret history."
"此外，德瓦卢瓦骑士在其他很多方面都表现得优雅非凡，足以弥补社交界对那副黑人头耳环的看法。他确实煞费苦心地隐瞒自己的真实年纪并极力讨好他的朋友们。首先，我们必须指出，他对他的亚麻衬衣极为讲究。如今，有教养之人在衣着方面只能通过衬衣来彰显自己与众不同了。骑士的衬衣总是精致而洁白，贵族气派十足。至于他的外套，尽管干净异常，却总是旧的，但不会有污迹和褶子。骑士对其衣物的寒酸无动于衷，对于注意到这一点的人来说，他保存衣物的方法十分不可思议。骑士虽不至于用玻璃片刮衣服的接缝处——这是威尔士亲王发明的衣物改良法，但他的确效仿了英国上流社会的基本原则，并且自我感觉良好，但阿郎松的人却不大理解。社交界真得感谢那些对其如此用心的人。这种做法的确是实践了《圣经》中最困难的训诫，即以德报怨。沐浴过后神清气爽，再加上所有其他精心的装扮，都与这位老骑士的蓝色眼睛、象牙般的牙齿和金黄色的头发相得益彰。","Besides, the Chevalier de Valois redeemed those negroes’ heads by so many other graces that society felt itself sufficiently compensated.He really took such immense trouble to conceal his age and give pleasure to his friends.In the first place, we must call attention to the extreme care he gave to his linen, the only distinction that well-bred men can nowadays exhibit in their clothes.The linen of the chevalier was invariably of a fineness and whiteness that were truly aristocratic.As for his coat, though remarkable for its cleanliness, it was always half worn-out, but without spots or creases.The preservation of that garment was something marvellous to those who noticed the chevalier’s high-bred indifference to its shabbiness.He did not go so far as to scrape the seams with glass,—a refinement invented by the Prince of Wales; but he did practice the rudiments of English elegance with a personal satisfaction little understood by the people of Alencon.The world owes a great deal to persons who take such pains to please it.In this there is certainly some accomplishment of that most difficult precept of the Gospel about rendering good for evil.This freshness of ablution and all the other little cares harmonized charmingly with the blue eyes, the ivory teeth, and the blond person of the old chevalier."
"唯一美中不足的是这位退休的美少年已经没有一点男子气概了，他似乎只能靠光鲜的衣饰来掩盖自己服役于情场后留下的伤害。不过有一点要赶紧说明，骑士的声音可以说是与他精美的金发形成了鲜明的对比。除非你赞同几位人类心脏研究者的观点，认为骑士的声音是从鼻腔里发出来的，否则，他洪亮饱满并带有回声的嗓音，一定会让你对他的发音器官感到惊异。他并没有古典音乐中男低音的音量，但他的声音略受压抑，十分悦耳，像是英国号角的音质，坚定而甜美，刚劲却柔和。","The only blemish was that this retired Adonis had nothing manly about him; he seemed to be employing this toilet varnish to hide the ruins occasioned by the military service of gallantry only.But we must hasten to add that his voice produced what might be called an antithesis to his blond delicacy.Unless you adopted the opinion of certain observers of the human heart, and thought that the chevalier had the voice of his nose, his organ of speech would have amazed you by its full and redundant sound.Without possessing the volume of classical bass voices, the tone of it was pleasing from a slightly muffled quality like that of an English bugle, which is firm and sweet, strong but velvety."
"骑士早已摒弃了某些保王党至今还穿着的那种可笑的礼服装束，他坦率地让自己变得摩登起来。人们总是看到他穿着一件有着镀金扣子的栗色上衣，配有金搭扣的棱纹塔夫绸半紧身裤，白色无绣花马甲，无领衬衣并打着领结——他并没有摒弃这种法国老式装束的特点，也许是因为这样能让他露出他的脖子，正如最光滑的修道院院长的脖子一般。他锃亮的黑色皮鞋上面镶着方形的扣环，惹人注目，现在的人已经对这种款式一无所知。骑士总是让两条表链平行地从他马甲的两个口袋中垂下来，这是另一种十八世纪的服装风格，备受督政府时期言谈做作、衣着奇特的年轻人推崇。这种过渡式装束将两个世纪的风格结合在一起，让骑士显得极具法国侯爵的优雅风格。自莫尔的最后一个门徒弗勒里谢世之后，这一秘密已经在法国消失了。","The chevalier had repudiated the ridiculous costume still preserved by certain monarchical old men; he had frankly modernized himself.He was always seen in a maroon-colored coat with gilt buttons, half-tight breeches of poult-de-soie with gold buckles, a white waistcoat without embroidery, and a tight cravat showing no shirt-collar,—a last vestige of the old French costume which he did not renounce, perhaps, because it enabled him to show a neck like that of the sleekest abbe.His shoes were noticeable for their square buckles, a style of which the present generation has no knowledge; these buckles were fastened to a square of polished black leather.The chevalier allowed two watch-chains to hang parallel to each other from each of his waistcoat pockets,—another vestige of the eighteenth century, which the Incroyables had not disdained to use under the Directory.This transition costume, uniting as it did two centuries, was worn by the chevalier with the high-bred grace of an old French marquis, the secret of which is lost to France since the day when Fleury, Mole’s last pupil, vanished."
"虽然看上去这老单身汉的私生活暴露在众目睽睽之下，但实际上却十分神秘。说得好听点，他住的地方还算不错，在河道街拉尔多太太房子的三楼；拉尔多太太是这座城市里最好也最忙的洗衣女工。这倒解释了为什么骑士的衬衣总是那么讲究的原因了。倒霉的是，终有一天，阿郎松城里的人相信骑士的所作所为并不完全符合绅士派头，因而感到内疚。事实上，他在晚年偷偷地娶了一个叫赛查丽娜的女人，还有了一个孩子，但这个孩子来得太过突然，谁都没有准备。","The private life of this old bachelor was apparently open to all eyes, though in fact it was quite mysterious.He lived in a lodging that was modest, to say the best of it, in the rue du Cours, on the second floor of a house belonging to Madame Lardot, the best and busiest washerwoman in the town.This circumstance will explain the excessive nicety of his linen.Ill-luck would have it that the day came when Alencon was guilty of believing that the chevalier had not always comported himself as a gentleman should, and that in fact he was secretly married in his old age to a certain Cesarine,—the mother of a child which had had the impertinence to come into the world without being called for."
"一位名叫迪布斯基耶的先生说：“他帮了那个女人，却被戴上了长期的枷锁。”","“He had given his hand,” as a certain Monsieur du Bousquier remarked, “to the person who had long had him under irons.”"
"这可怕的诽谤使骑士的晚年更加凄楚了，因为接下来的一幕将会说明，骑士多年的希望已经落空，而他为之牺牲了很多。","This horrible calumny embittered the last days of the dainty chevalier all the more because, as the present Scene will show, he had lost a hope long cherished to which he had made many sacrifices."
"拉尔多太太按一年仅一百法郎的价格将她房子三楼的两个房间租给了德瓦卢瓦骑士。可这位尊敬的先生每天都在外面吃饭，只有睡觉的时候才回来。因此他唯一的开销便是早餐，他总是要一杯可可，配着黄油和面包，以及当季的水果。他只有在最冷的冬日才生火，并且够他起床用就行。在上午十一点至下午四点之间，他会四处走走，读读报纸，看看朋友。自他在阿郎松安顿下来，他就如实地向人承认自己的穷困，说他的全部财产就是每年六百法郎的养老金。他昔日的财富如今只剩下这个了，他必须每季都去见他的代理人（代理人手中有他的养老金材料）。事实上，阿郎松的一位银行家每三个月付给他一百五十法郎，是巴黎的一位叫博尔丹的先生寄来的，他是巴黎沙特莱民事裁判所的最后一位代理人。骑士每对一个人第一次坦白这些事都会要求他严守秘密，因此这些事已经众人皆知了。","Madame Lardot leased to the chevalier two rooms on the second floor of her house, for the modest sum of one hundred francs a year.The worthy gentleman dined out every day, returning only in time to go to bed.His sole expense therefore was for breakfast, invariably composed of a cup of chocolate, with bread and butter and fruits in their season.He made no fire except in the coldest winter, and then only enough to get up by.Between eleven and four o’clock he walked about, went to read the papers, and paid visits.From the time of his settling in Alencon he had nobly admitted his poverty, saying that his whole fortune consisted in an annuity of six hundred francs a year, the sole remains of his former opulence,—a property which obliged him to see his man of business (who held the annuity papers) quarterly.In truth, one of the Alencon bankers paid him every three months one hundred and fifty francs, sent down by Monsieur Bordin of Paris, the last of the procureurs du Chatelet.Every one knew these details because the chevalier exacted the utmost secrecy from the persons to whom he first confided them."
"德瓦卢瓦先生的穷困倒也给他带来了好事。他成了阿郎松最有名望的人家的座上客，并且所有的宴会都会邀请他参加。他会玩牌，会讲故事，为人和气而有教养，他的这些特点广为人知并备受推崇，以至于如果某场宴会上没有他的话，就会被认为是不成功的宴会。宴会的主人及他们的妻子都觉得需要他那表示赞同的鬼脸。如果一位年轻女子在舞会上听到骑士对她说“你打扮得真漂亮！”，她会感到比羞辱自己的情敌还开心。德瓦卢瓦先生是唯一能够将旧时代的一些话说得很动听的人。像“我的心肝”、“我的宝贝”、“我的小乖乖”、“我的皇后”这些词，还有一七七零年的那些表达爱意的昵称，从他的嘴里说出来便会有种令人无法抗拒的风雅味道。总之，骑士有特权使用那些表示最高级的词语。他极少恭维别人，但他的恭维之词赢得了所有老年妇女的青睐。他讨好每一个人，甚至是他一无所求的政府官员也不例外。他在赌桌上的表现卓著，引人注目：打牌时他从不抱怨，他会鼓励赌输了的对手，他也从不会指责或指手画脚地告诉自己的搭档要怎么出牌。发牌的时候，如果有人说出令人反感的话，骑士往往会用可与莫尔相媲美的动作取出自己的鼻烟盒，看一眼戈里扎公主，颇显尊贵地打开盖子，晃一晃，拣一拣，把鼻烟堆成一撮。等到牌发完，他也已经将两个鼻孔塞上鼻烟，并将公主放回他的马甲口袋里——总是左边的口袋。他既不采用表示轻蔑的沉默，也不会说些别人可能听不懂的带讽刺的话，只有他这么一位“风雅”世纪（与“伟大”世纪相对照）的绅士才能从中想出这么一个折中的办法。他接受牌技不高的赌家，并知道如何让他们发挥得最好。他的好脾气很讨人喜欢，很多人都说：“我真敬佩德瓦卢瓦先生！”","Monsieur de Valois gathered the fruit of his misfortunes.His place at table was laid in all the most distinguished houses in Alencon, and he was bidden to all soirees.His talents as a card-player, a narrator, an amiable man of the highest breeding, were so well known and appreciated that parties would have seemed a failure if the dainty connoisseur was absent.Masters of houses and their wives felt the need of his approving grimace.When a young woman heard the chevalier say at a ball, “You are delightfully well-dressed!” she was more pleased at such praise than she would have been at mortifying a rival.Monsieur de Valois was the only man who could perfectly pronounce certain phrases of the olden time.The words, “my heart,” “my jewel,” “my little pet,” “my queen,” and the amorous diminutives of 1770, had a grace that was quite irresistible when they came from his lips.In short, the chevalier had the privilege of superlatives.His compliments, of which he was stingy, won the good graces of all the old women; he made himself agreeable to every one, even to the officials of the government, from whom he wanted nothing.His behavior at cards had a lofty distinction which everybody noticed: he never complained; he praised his adversaries when they lost; he did not rebuke or teach his partners by showing them how they ought to have played.When, in the course of a deal, those sickening dissertations on the game would take place, the chevalier invariably drew out his snuff-box with a gesture that was worthy of Mole, looked at the Princess Goritza, raised the cover with dignity, shook, sifted, massed the snuff, and gathered his pinch, so that by the time the cards were dealt he had decorated both nostrils and replaced the princess in his waistcoat pocket,—always on his left side.A gentleman of the “good” century (in distinction from the “grand” century) could alone have invented that compromise between contemptuous silence and a sarcasm which might not have been understood.He accepted poor players and knew how to make the best of them.His delightful equability of temper made many persons say,—""I do admire the Chevalier de Valois!"""
"他的言谈举止和他的性格一样温文尔雅。他努力做到既不得罪男人，也不得罪女人。不论是身体还是精神方面的缺陷，他都耐心地听无聊的人向他唠叨外省生活中各种鸡毛蒜皮的烦心事（靠着戈里扎公主的帮助），比如早餐鸡蛋没煮熟啊，咖啡里加的奶油变了味啊，可笑的生活保健细节啊，睡觉惊醒啊，做梦啊，探访啊。骑士总能露出一种感伤的眼神，用一种古典的态度来表示同情，这使得他成了最受欢迎的听众。他总能得体地配合说话人插上句“啊！”、“唉！”和“您到底做了什么啊？”一直到他去世，也没有任何人想到在他听别人唠叨的时候，他心中一直想着他和戈里扎公主的浪漫史呢。有谁曾想过，一段旧情能给社交带来帮助，而爱情又是如此利于社交、如此有用呢？这就能解释为什么骑士总是赢钱（他从来没有过不带走差不多六法郎赢头离开沙龙的时候），却还是这座城市的宠儿。他很少输钱，但每次输了他都故意向所有人宣告。","His conversation, his manners, seemed bland, like his person.He endeavored to shock neither man nor woman.Indulgent to defects both physical and mental, he listened patiently (by the help of the Princess Goritza) to the many dull people who related to him the petty miseries of provincial life,—an egg ill-boiled for breakfast, coffee with feathered cream, burlesque details about health, disturbed sleep, dreams, visits.The chevalier could call up a languishing look, he could take on a classic attitude to feign compassion, which made him a most valuable listener; he could put in an “Ah!” and a “Bah!” and a “What DID you do?” with charming appropriateness.He died without any one suspecting him of even an allusion to the tender passages of his romance with the Princess Goritza.Has any one ever reflected on the service a dead sentiment can do to society; how love may become both social and useful?This will serve to explain why, in spite of his constant winning at play (he never left a salon without carrying off with him about six francs), the old chevalier remained the spoilt darling of the town.His losses—which, by the bye, he always proclaimed, were very rare."
"所有认识他的人都宣称他们从没有在任何地方遇到过如此可爱的老好人，甚至在都灵的埃及博物馆里都没有。在这世上的任何国度里，都不会有像骑士这般讨人喜欢地过寄生生活的了。即使最精于为自己盘算的人，也无法做到将自私表现得比这位老绅士更自然而又不得罪人了，他因而得到了人们忠诚的友谊。如果有谁来找德瓦卢瓦先生，麻烦他帮个小忙，这个人离开的时候一定会觉得德瓦卢瓦先生是很可爱的人，而且肯定会相信他不答应帮忙确实是有心无力，或者是如果他介入只会把事情搞砸。","All who know him declare that they have never met, not even in the Egyptian museum at Turin, so agreeable a mummy.In no country in the world did parasitism ever take on so pleasant a form.Never did selfishness of a most concentrated kind appear less forth-putting, less offensive, than in this old gentleman; it stood him in place of devoted friendship.If some one asked Monsieur de Valois to do him a little service which might have discommoded him, that some one did not part from the worthy chevalier without being truly enchanted with him, and quite convinced that he either could not do the service demanded, or that he should injure the affair if he meddled in it."
"要解释骑士的神秘生活，被“真实”这个无情的荡妇卡住脖子的史学家还被迫说，在“光荣”而可悲的七月之后，阿郎松的人们发现骑士先生晚上赌博赢的钱加起来每三个月大概有一百五十法郎，并且发现就是这位聪明的老绅士竟斗胆给自己寄终身年金，为的是不要让自己在这个崇尚实利的地方显得一贫如洗。他的很多朋友（他那时已经不在世了，你要知道这点）都断然否认这件令人好奇的事情，并视之为无稽之谈，他们认为德瓦卢瓦骑士是一位可敬的、高贵的绅士，那是自由党在诽谤他。幸好那些精明的赌徒在看牌的人中也能碰到支持这种观点的人。他们耻于为错误辩解，因而坚决否认关于骑士的这些传闻。请不要指责这些人固执，他们很看重自己的尊严。政府已经给他们列出了美德的范例，其中包括给他们下葬前不用唱赞美诗以祈求主宽恕他们的失败。如果骑士真的采取了如此精明的一招，自然会得到德格拉蒙骑士的尊敬、德弗乃斯特男爵的微笑、德象卡德侯爵的握手，即使如此，难道他就不再是那位和蔼可亲的食客，那位风趣健谈的人士，那位沉着镇静的赌徒，那位著名轶事专家，那个所有阿郎松人都喜爱的人了吗？再说，这种行为本属于一个人的自由意志范畴，从哪一点看会被认为是有违绅士的道德规范呢？现在那么多人被迫支付别人的养老金，还有什么比为自己最好的朋友支付更自然的事呢？可是拉伊俄斯已经去世了……","To explain the problematic existence of the chevalier, the historian, whom Truth, that cruel wanton, grasps by the throat, is compelled to say that after the “glorious” sad days of July, Alencon discovered that the chevalier’s nightly winnings amounted to about one hundred and fifty francs every three months; and that the clever old nobleman had had the pluck to send to himself his annuity in order not to appear in the eyes of a community, which loves the main chance, to be entirely without resources.Many of his friends (he was by that time dead, you will please remark) have contested mordicus this curious fact, declaring it to be a fable, and upholding the Chevalier de Valois as a respectable and worthy gentleman whom the liberals calumniated.Luckily for shrewd players, there are people to be found among the spectators who will always sustain them.Ashamed of having to defend a piece of wrong-doing, they stoutly deny it.Do not accuse them of wilful infatuation; such men have a sense of their dignity; governments set them the example of a virtue which consists in burying their dead without chanting the Misere of their defeats.If the chevalier did allow himself this bit of shrewd practice,—which, by the bye, would have won him the regard of the Chevalier de Gramont, a smile from the Baron de Foeneste, a shake of the hand from the Marquis de Moncade,—was he any the less that amiable guest, that witty talker, that imperturbable card-player, that famous teller of anecdotes, in whom all Alencon took delight?Besides, in what way was this action, which is certainly within the rights of a man’s own will,—in what way was it contrary to the ethics of a gentleman?When so many persons are forced to pay annuities to others, what more natural than to pay one to his own best friend?But Laius is dead—"
"回到我们之前说的，骑士过了十五年这样的生活后，积攒了一万零几百法郎。据他说，波旁王朝复辟时，他的一个老朋友，前黑马火枪手中尉德蓬布勒通侯爵还了他一千二百皮斯托尔，这是当时他借给蓬布勒通亡命国外用的。这件事在当时造成了轰动，此后被用来驳斥《宪政报》上对于某些流亡国外的人还债方式的讥讽。当有人在骑士面前提到德蓬布勒通侯爵这一高尚行为时，这位好好先生甚至连右半边脸都红了。每个人都为德瓦卢瓦先生得到这笔意外之财而由衷地感到高兴。他去征求了有钱人的意见，询问怎样投资这笔往日财富最安全。他对复辟王朝的前景很有信心，因此最终将他的钱存入了国库，那时的定期利息是五十六法郎二十五生丁。骑士说他认识德勒农古先生、德纳瓦兰先生、德韦纳伊先生、德方丹先生和德拉比亚尔迪埃先生，这几位先生为他从国王的个人金库中谋得了三百法郎的津贴，而且还给他寄来了圣路易十字勋章。至于骑士是用什么办法获得他的头衔和功劳这两项殊荣的，从来没有人能了解清楚。但是毫无疑问的是，凭着他在西部天主教军队中服役的历史，圣路易十字勋章授予他退休上校的军衔。","To return to the period of which we are writing: after about fifteen years of this way of life the chevalier had amassed ten thousand and some odd hundred francs.On the return of the Bourbons, one of his old friends, the Marquis de Pombreton, formerly lieutenant in the Black mousquetaires, returned to him—so he said—twelve hundred pistoles which he had lent to the marquis for the purpose of emigrating.This event made a sensation; it was used later to refute the sarcasms of the “Constitutionnel,” on the method employed by some emigres in paying their debts.When this noble act of the Marquis de Pombreton was lauded before the chevalier, the good man reddened even to his right cheek.Every one rejoiced frankly at this windfall for Monsieur de Valois, who went about consulting moneyed people as to the safest manner of investing this fragment of his past opulence.Confiding in the future of the Restoration, he finally placed his money on the Grand-Livre at the moment when the funds were at fifty-six francs and twenty-five centimes.Messieurs de Lenoncourt, de Navarreins, de Verneuil, de Fontaine, and La Billardiere, to whom he was known, he said, obtained for him, from the king’s privy purse, a pension of three hundred francs, and sent him, moreover, the cross of Saint-Louis.Never was it known positively by what means the old chevalier obtained these two solemn consecrations of his title and merits.But one thing is certain; the cross of Saint-Louis authorized him to take the rank of retired colonel in view of his service in the Catholic armies of the West."
"如今也无人知晓骑士养老金的虚实了，但除此之外，他确实多了一千法郎的固定收入。尽管骑士的经济状况有了这样的改善，他的生活、举止和外表都没有改变。只是那红绶带令他的栗色外套显得越发耀眼，简直可以说，使骑士的绅士面貌更加完美了。自一八零二年开始，骑士都是用一方非常古色古香的印章加盖信件。印章刻得很糟糕，但是通过印章，卡泰朗家族、德埃斯格里尼翁家族和特雷维尔家族的人可以看到，法国政党，印章的图案一分为二，一边为直纹红色，另一边为直纹红色带五个菱形，连接处成十字形，整个印章底色为黑色并间以银十字。印章的上部是个骑士帽。印章上的题铭是“瓦莱奥”。带着这样高贵的印章，这个所谓的瓦卢瓦家族的私生子完全可以登上世界各地的所有王室马车。","Besides his fiction of an annuity, about which no one at the present time knew anything, the chevalier really had, therefore, a bona fide income of a thousand francs.But in spite of this bettering of his circumstances, he made no change in his life, manners, or appearance, except that the red ribbon made a fine effect on his maroon-colored coat, and completed, so to speak, the physiognomy of a gentleman.After 1802, the chevalier sealed his letters with a very old seal, ill-engraved to be sure, by which the Casterans, the d’Esgrignons, the Troisvilles were enabled to see that he bore: Party of France, two cottises gemelled gules, and gules, five mascles or, placed end to end; on a chief sable, a cross argent.For crest, a knight’s helmet.For motto: “Valeo.”Bearing such noble arms, the so-called bastard of the Valois had the right to get into all the royal carriages of the world."
"很多人羡慕这老单身汉的舒适平静的生活。他的生活无非就是玩惠斯特牌，玩波士顿牌，下西洋双六棋，玩翻转棋以及玩皮克牌，并且全都玩得很好；同时，他还能吃能喝，能优雅地吸着鼻烟，能悠闲地在城里漫步。几乎所有的阿郎松人都认为，这种生活不会牵扯到野心和重大的利益关系。虽然羡慕骑士的人都认为他生活得很简单，但其实不然。在偏僻的村庄里，你会发现一些有气无力的人，表面上看起来毫无生机，但是他们却狂热地研究着鳞翅类或贝类学，比方说，这些人甘愿在飞蛾、蝴蝶或是什么维纳斯贝上费尽苦心地做研究。骑士不仅有他自己的贝壳，而且还胸怀大志，他追求志向的劲儿简直和希克斯特五世不相上下。他的抱负是娶一位富有的老姑娘，当然是为了作为接近宫中最高阶层的一个踏脚石。而这正是他装扮高贵，居住在阿郎松的秘密动机。","Many persons envied the quiet existence of this old bachelor, spent on whist, boston, backgammon, reversi, and piquet, all well played, on dinners well digested, snuff gracefully inhaled, and tranquil walks about the town.Nearly all Alencon believed this life to be exempt from ambitions and serious interests; but no man has a life as simple as envious neighbors attribute to him.You will find in the most out—of-the way villages human mollusks, creatures apparently dead, who have passions for lepidoptera or for conchology, let us say,—beings who will give themselves infinite pains about moths, butterflies, or the concha Veneris.Not only did the chevalier have his own particular shells, but he cherished an ambitious desire which he pursued with a craft so profound as to be worthy of Sixtus the Fifth: he wanted to marry a certain rich old maid, with the intention, no doubt, of making her a stepping-stone by which to reach the more elevated regions of the court.There, then, lay the secret of his royal bearing and of his residence in Alencon."
"第二章 苏珊和老头们","CHAPTER II SUSANNAH AND THE ELDERS"
"十六年——这是骑士的计年法——仲春时节一个星期三的清晨，骑士正在穿他那件绿色绣花的旧锦缎便袍，虽然他耳朵里塞了棉花，他仍然听见一位少女跑上楼梯的轻盈脚步声。马上就有人小心翼翼地在他的门上敲了三下，然后不待应门，一个美人儿便像一条鳗鱼一样溜进了这老单身汉的房间。“啊！苏珊，是你吗？”德瓦卢瓦骑士说道，同时继续干着他的活，拿着剃刀在一块皮上来回地磨。“亲爱的小淘气宝贝，你来有什么事呀？”","On a Wednesday morning, early, toward the middle of spring, in the year 16,—such was his mode of reckoning,—at the moment when the chevalier was putting on his old green-flowered damask dressing-gown, he heard, despite the cotton in his ears, the light step of a young girl who was running up the stairway.Presently three taps were discreetly struck upon the door; then, without waiting for any response, a handsome girl slipped like an eel into the room occupied by the old bachelor.“ Ah! Is it you, Suzanne?” said the Chevalier de Valois, without discontinuing his occupation, which was that of stropping his razor.“What have you come for, my dear little jewel of mischief?”"
"“我来告诉你一件可能让你既高兴又难过的事。”","“I have come to tell you something which may perhaps give you as much pleasure as pain?”"
"“是关于赛查丽娜的事吗？”“赛查丽娜！我才不关心你的赛查丽娜呢！”她俏皮地说道，半认真半无所谓的样子。","“Is it anything about Cesarine?”“Cesarine! Much I care about your Cesarine!” she said with a saucy air, half serious, half indifferent."
"这位可爱的苏珊姑娘是拉尔多太太手下的一名女工，她现在这种滑稽可笑的行为将对我们故事主角的命运产生极大的影响。现在我们简要说一下这房子的构造。洗衣作坊占据了整个一层。人们在小院子里的电线上晾晒绣花手绢、女用围巾、披肩、衬衣的活袖口、带襟饰的衬衣、领带、花边、绣花长裙等，总之，都是城里上等人家的优质衣物。骑士声称，从省长妻子拿来洗的披肩数目上便可知道她的婚外情如何。尽管骑士通过这种观察能了解很多风流韵事，但是他从未多嘴过，从未对人说过可能会让人将他拒之门外的讽刺语（他可聪明啦）。所以，请将德瓦卢瓦先生视为品行高尚之人，只是像其他许多人一样，他的才能受限于狭小的生活圈子而得不到发挥。只不过——他毕竟是男人嘛——他也会给女人抛几个媚眼，让她们颤抖；而在了解他用情谨慎和怜惜女人脆弱的情感后，所有的女人都会由衷地爱上他。","This charming Suzanne, whose present comical performance was to exercise a great influence in the principal personages of our history, was a work-girl at Madame Lardot’s.One word here on the topography of the house.The wash-rooms occupied the whole of the ground floor.The little courtyard was used to hang out on wire cords embroidered handkerchiefs, collarets, capes, cuffs, frilled shirts, cravats, laces, embroidered dresses,—in short, all the fine linen of the best families of the town.The chevalier assumed to know from the number of her capes in the wash how the love-affairs of the wife of the prefect were going on.Though he guessed much from observations of this kind, the chevalier was discretion itself; he was never betrayed into an epigram (he had plenty of wit) which might have closed to him an agreeable salon.You are therefore to consider Monsieur de Valois as a man of superior manners, whose talents, like those of many others, were lost in a narrow sphere.Only—for, after all, he was a man—he permitted himself certain penetrating glances which could make some women tremble; although they all loved him heartily as soon as they discovered the depth of his discretion and the sympathy that he felt for their little weaknesses."
"拉尔多太太的杂工是一位四十六岁的老姑娘，奇丑无比，住在跟骑士对门的屋子里。楼上就是阁楼了，冬季衣服会晾在那里。每套公寓都有两个房间，一间朝街，一间朝着院子。在骑士房间的下面住着一个瘫痪的老人，是拉尔多太太的祖父，名叫格雷万的老海盗。他曾在西墨兹海军上将手下在印度服役，现在已经完全聋了。至于拉尔多太太则住在二楼的另一套房子里。她非常喜欢有钱人，但对骑士的所作所为则可以说是视而不见。在她看来，德瓦卢瓦先生是一位凡事都不会出错的专制君主。如果有人说她手下的哪个女工失足了和骑士有染，她就会说：“他人那么好！”因此，尽管这房子和省里的每一栋房屋一样都像是用玻璃做的，但却像是大盗储藏赃物的山洞一样保险。","The head woman, Madame Lardot’s factotum, an old maid of forty-six, hideous to behold, lived on the opposite side of the passage to the chevalier.Above them were the attics where the linen was dried in winter.Each apartment had two rooms,—one lighted from the street, the other from the courtyard.Beneath the chevalier’s room there lived a paralytic, Madame Lardot’s grandfather, an old buccaneer named Grevin, who had served under Admiral Simeuse in India, and was now stone-deaf.As for Madame Lardot, who occupied the other lodging on the first floor, she had so great a weakness for persons of condition that she may well have been thought blind to the ways of the chevalier.To her, Monsieur de Valois was a despotic monarch who did right in all things.Had any of her workwomen been guilty of a happiness attributed to the chevalier she would have said, “He is so lovable!”Thus, though the house was of glass, like all provincial houses, it was discreet as a robber’s cave."
"洗衣作坊里所有爱使小心眼的女人们都把骑士当作天生的知己，作坊的门通常都敞着，骑士每每从门前经过，总会给他的那些“小鸭子们”带些东西，像是巧克力、糖果、缎带、花边、金十字章等等女工们喜欢的小玩意儿，因此，这位好心的老绅士也得到了她们的喜爱。女人有一种本能，可以分清哪些男人是爱她们的，哪些男人只是喜欢呆在她们的身边却不会献殷勤。在这方面，女人有着像狗一样灵敏的嗅觉，在人群中会径直走向吸引自己的男人。","A born confidant to all the little intrigues of the work-rooms, the chevalier never passed the door, which usually stood open, without giving something to his little ducks,—chocolate, bonbons, ribbons, laces, gilt crosses, and such like trifles adored by grisettes; consequently, the kind old gentleman was adored in return.Women have an instinct which enables them to divine the men who love them, who like to be near them, and exact no payment for gallantries.In this respect women have the instinct of dogs, who in a mixed company will go straight to the man to whom animals are sacred."
"可怜的骑士还保留着年轻时代的习惯，喜欢向女人献殷勤，这是旧时贵族大老爷的特质。他一直忠于小家小户的体制，喜欢让女人发点小财。只有女人知道怎么接受馈赠，因为她们总可以付出回报。但是这位骑士再也不能为了一位情妇而毁了自己了。他现在殷勤送人的不是用钞票包着的最上等的糖果，而是纸袋装的太妃糖。让我们说句赞扬阿郎松的话吧，女人们收到太妃糖可高兴了，比起杜黛往日收到德阿图瓦伯爵赠送的一套镀金梳妆台或是什么高级服饰还要开心。所有这些女工都很清楚骑士的威仪已大不如前，因此为了他，对外她们都绝口不提他们之间有多亲密。当她们去某些客户家送洗好的衣物时，即使被问到德瓦卢瓦骑士的情况，她们都会充满敬意地谈论这位骑士，把他说得比实际还老。她们把骑士描述成一位最值得尊敬的先生，他的生活像是一朵圣洁的花。但是一旦回到作坊，她们就像鹦鹉一样栖息在他肩膀上。他喜欢听女工谈论在别人家里听到的夫妻间的秘密，于是每天这些女工都会将阿郎松城的风流韵事讲给他听。他称这些女工是他“穿着裙子的报纸”，是他的“有声连载小说”。德萨蒂纳先生也从未有过如此聪明又廉价的侦探，而且这些人在心里使坏时表面上还是一副正儿八经的样子。因此，可以说，每天早上骑士的早餐时间通常就是他有如神仙般开心的时刻了。","The poor Chevalier de Valois retained from his former life the need of bestowing gallant protection, a quality of the seigneurs of other days.Faithful to the system of the “petite maison”, he liked to enrich women,—the only beings who know how to receive, because they can always return.But the poor chevalier could no longer ruin himself for a mistress.Instead of the choicest bonbons wrapped in bank-bills, he gallantly presented paper-bags full of toffee.Let us say to the glory of Alencon that the toffee was accepted with more joy than la Duthe ever showed at a gilt service or a fine equipage offered by the Comte d’Artois.All these grisettes fully understood the fallen majesty of the Chevalier de Valois, and they kept their private familiarities with him a profound secret for his sake.If they were questioned about him in certain houses when they carried home the linen, they always spoke respectfully of the chevalier, and made him out older than he really was; they talked of him as a most respectable monsieur, whose life was a flower of sanctity; but once in their own regions they perched on his shoulders like so many parrots.He liked to be told the secrets which washerwomen discover in the bosom of households, and day after day these girls would tell him the cancans which were going the round of Alencon.He called them his “petticoat gazettes,” his “talking feuilletons.”Never did Monsieur de Sartines have spies more intelligent and less expensive, or minions who showed more honor while displaying their rascality of mind.So it may be said that in the mornings, while breakfasting, the chevalier usually amused himself as much as the saints in heaven."
"苏珊是他最喜欢的人之一。她很聪明，而且野心勃勃，是像索菲·阿诺尔德那样的材料。加之她长得很漂亮，堪比意大利画家提香邀请的那位在黑丝绒上摆姿势、助其描绘出维纳斯形象的妓女。不过，虽然她的眼睛和额头长得很清秀，面庞下部的轮廓却很一般。她属于诺曼底美女，容光焕发，面色红润，体型丰满，是那种鲁本斯笔下具有体态丰满的皮肉，外加法尔内塞时期赫拉克勒斯式的肌肉的美女，而不是美第奇家族收藏的阿波罗的优雅伴侣——维纳斯雕像那种苗条的身段。","Suzanne was one of his favorites, a clever, ambitious girl, made of the stuff of a Sophie Arnold, and handsome withal, as the handsomest courtesan invited by Titian to pose on black velvet for a model of Venus; although her face, fine about the eyes and forehead, degenerated, lower down, into commonness of outline.Hers was a Norman beauty, fresh, high-colored, redundant, the flesh of Rubens covering the muscles of the Farnese Hercules, and not the slender articulations of the Venus de’ Medici, Apollo’s graceful consort."
"“喂，我的孩子，给我讲讲你那大大小小的恋爱故事吧，不管是什么。”","“Well, my child, tell me your great or your little adventure, whatever it is.”"
"骑士具有比较特别的一点，令其从巴黎到北京都显得与众不同，那就是他对这些女工有一种慈父之情。她们让他想起往日的那些著名的歌剧王后们，她们的名声在十八世纪足足三分之一的时间里名扬整个欧洲。如今这个骑士所生活过的女性王国像任何伟大的事物——像耶稣会会士、海盗、修道院长老和包税人——一样，已被遗忘。很显然，这位老绅士已经掌握了令人无法抗拒的好心态，随和的性情，不以自我为中心，听之任之的态度，还有朱庇特到阿尔克墨涅家去时各种谦逊的手段。众神之王朱庇特受到各种各样的诱惑，将自己的雷电棒丢给一个魔鬼，想趁朱诺远离的时候让他的奥林匹斯山充满愚蠢的行为、简单的夜宴和大量的女性。","The particular point about the chevalier which would have made him noticeable from Paris to Pekin, was the gentle paternity of his manner to grisettes.They reminded him of the illustrious operatic queens of his early days, whose celebrity was European during a good third of the eighteenth century.It is certain that the old gentleman, who had lived in days gone by with that feminine nation now as much forgotten as many other great things,—like the Jesuits, the Buccaneers, the Abbes, and the Farmers-General,—had acquired an irresistible good-humor, a kindly ease, a laisser-aller devoid of egotism, the self-effacement of Jupiter with Alcmene, of the king intending to be duped, who casts his thunderbolts to the devil, wants his Olympus full of follies, little suppers, feminine profusions—but with Juno out of the way, be it understood."
"骑士穿着他那旧的绿色锦缎室内便袍坐在空荡荡的房间里，地上只铺着一块寒碜的挂毯当作地毯，墙上糊着小酒馆里用的壁纸，上面是路易十六家族的侧影，在一株垂柳的枝叶间，都是保王党在恐怖时代发明的各式感伤玩意儿。骑士虽已老了，站在一个以花哨的蕾丝装饰的又老又寒酸的梳妆台前刮脸，但他仍然浑身散发出十八世纪的味道。年轻时代所有放荡不羁的姿态又重现出来，他看上去像是富有得借给了别人三十万法郎，而他的马车就在门前等候的样子。他就像贝尔捷在莫斯科指挥着已溃不成军的部队撤退一样伟大。","In spite of his old green damask dressing-gown and the bareness of the room in which he sat, where the floor was covered with a shabby tapestry in place of carpet, and the walls were hung with tavern-paper presenting the profiles of Louis XVI and members of his family, traced among the branches of a weeping willow with other sentimentalities invented by royalism during the Terror,—in spite of his ruins, the chevalier, trimming his beard before a shabby old toilet-table, draped with trumpery lace, exhaled an essence of the eighteenth century.All the libertine graces of his youth reappeared; he seemed to have the wealth of three hundred thousand francs of debt, while his vis-a-vis waited before the door.He was grand,—like Berthier on the retreat from Moscow, issuing orders to an army that existed no longer."
"“骑士先生，”苏珊怪声怪气地说，“在我看来您不需要我告诉您什么，您自己看看就知道了。”","“Monsieur le chevalier,” replied Suzanne, drolly, “seems to me I needn’t tell you anything; you’ve only to look.”"
"说着，苏珊侧过身去，做出一副“我的话没错”的表情。要知道骑士可是个狡猾的老家伙，他一边拿着刮脸刀贴在喉咙处，一边垂下右眼看了下女工，就装作明白了。","And Suzanne presented a side view of herself which gave a sort of lawyer’s comment to her words.The chevalier, who, you must know, was a sly old bird, lowered his right eye on the grisette, still holding the razor at his throat, and pretended to understand."
"“好吧，好吧，我的小鸭子，我们马上聊聊。不过我看你有点过于着急了吧。”“拜托，骑士先生，难道我要等到我妈妈打我，等到拉尔多太太解雇我吗？如果我不赶紧到法国去，我在这儿永远嫁不了人，这里的男人都太滑稽可笑了。”“亲爱的，没用的。社会在变，现在的局势要让贵族倒霉，女人也要倒霉。政治的大动荡之后，就是社会风习的大动荡了。唉，过不了多久，女人就无以生存了。”说到这里，他将棉花从耳朵里拿出来，揉揉耳朵，接着说道：“女人草率地陷入感情就会吃大亏，她会绞尽脑汁，但再也回不去我们那个时代平淡快乐的生活，在那时我们可以不觉羞耻地享乐，可以有滋有味地过日子。”他擦了擦小黑人头，接着说：“女人在过去要结婚了是要大哭大闹的，可是现在，”他大笑道，“她们的眼泪都被木炭烤干了。总之，婚姻，”（说到这儿，他拿起镊子拔掉一根汗毛，继续道）“将变成让人难以忍受的事，而在我年轻的时候，婚姻是多么快乐的事啊！路易十四和路易十五的年代——你要记住，孩子——那是世上社会风气最好的时代了，可惜现在已经不复存在了。”“但是，骑士先生，”小女工说，“这事情关系到你可怜的小苏珊的品行和名声呢，我希望你不会遗弃她。”","“Well, well, my little duck, we’ll talk about that presently. But you are rather previous, it seems to me.”“Why, Monsieur le chevalier, ought I to wait until my mother beats me and Madame Lardot turns me off? If I don’t get away soon to Paris, I shall never be able to marry here, where men are so ridiculous.”“It can’t be helped, my dear; society is changing; women are just as much victims to the present state of things as the nobility themselves. After political overturn comes the overturn of morals. Alas! Before long woman won’t exist” (he took out the cotton-wool to arrange his ears); “she’ll lose everything by rushing into sentiment; she’ll wring her nerves; good-bye to all the good little pleasures of our time, desired without shame, accepted without nonsense.”(He polished up the little negroes’ heads.) “Women had hysterics in those days to get their ends, but now” (he began to laugh) “their vapors end in charcoal. In short, marriage” (here he picked up his pincers to remove a hair)“will become a thing intolerable; whereas it used to be so gay in my day! The reigns of Louis XIV. and Louis XV.—remember this, my child—said farewell to the finest manners and morals ever known to the world.”“But, Monsieur le chevalier,” said the grisette, “the matter now concerns the morals and honor of your poor little Suzanne, and I hope you won’t abandon her.”"
"“遗弃她！”骑士喊道，同时一边梳理好头发，“我宁愿改姓，也不会那么做的。”","“Abandon her!” cried the chevalier, finishing his hair; “I’d sooner abandon my own name.”"
"“噢！”苏珊感叹道。","“Ah!” exclaimed Suzanne."
"“现在你听我说，你这个小淘气鬼。”骑士说道，一边在一张很大的软坐沙发椅坐下。那是一种以前叫做“公爵夫人”的圈椅，是拉尔多太太费心给他弄来的。","“Now, listen to me, you little mischief,” said the chevalier, sitting down on a huge sofa, formerly called a duchesse, which Madame Lardot had been at some pains to find for him."
"他把俊俏的苏珊拉到他身前，用他的双膝夹着她的双腿。苏珊随他摆布，可是在大街上她却那么高傲，拒绝让任何男性向她献殷勤。这既出于女性端庄的礼节，也是因为她看不起那些人的庸俗。她现在这么大胆地站在骑士面前，这个曾经看透过许多更加狡猾的秘密想法的老家伙，一眼就估摸出是怎么回事了。他非常清楚没有哪个年轻姑娘会拿真正丢人现眼的事来开玩笑，但是他很谨慎地不去拆穿她的漂亮谎言。","He drew the magnificent Suzanne before him, holding her legs between his knees.She let him do as he liked, although in the street she was offish enough to other men, refusing their familiarities partly from decorum and partly for contempt for their commonness.She now stood audaciously in front of the chevalier, who, having fathomed in his day many other mysteries in minds that were far more wily, took in the situation at a single glance.He knew very well that no young girl would joke about a real dishonor; but he took good care not to knock over the pretty scaffolding of her lie as he touched it."
"“我们是自我诽谤，”骑士用无法模仿的姿态说道，“其实我们和心中的圣母一样的贞洁，我们完全可以按照自己的意愿结婚，但是我们渴望去巴黎，我们的魅力加上我们的精明，可以在那不费力地成为富人。我们想去看那个享乐之都是否还保留了年轻的德瓦卢瓦骑士，他有着马车、珠宝、歌剧院的包厢等等。俄国人、奥地利人和英国人给我们带来了百万财富。另外，我们有爱国精神，我们愿意帮助法国从这些上等人的口袋里把钱拿回来。嘿！嘿！亲爱的小鸭子坏蛋，这可不是个坏主意。你现在的生活圈可能会吵吵嚷嚷地闹腾一阵，但是要以成败论英雄。世上最糟糕的事，亲爱的，就是没有钱，而这正是你我的症结所在。我们很精明，因此认为如果可以勾住一个老光棍便能从中捞到好处。可是这个老光棍，我的心肝，是了解女人们的诡计的。也就是说，你要想说动我帮你的那件事做点什么，还不如去尝试把盐撒到一只麻雀的尾巴上呢。去巴黎吧，亲爱的，让一个老光棍伤心也没有关系。我不会阻拦你，事实上，我还会帮你。因为这个老光棍，苏珊，他天生是少女的储蓄罐。但是，不要把我搅和进去。听着，我的女王，你很了解生活。如果你把我搅进去，就会对我造成深深的伤害并带来巨大的痛苦。会伤害我是因为你将妨碍我在这个看重道德品行的地方结婚；会给我带来痛苦是因为如果你遇到麻烦了——虽然我认为不大可能，你这个狡黠的小姑娘——我可没有一文钱来帮你。你知道的，孩子，我穷得像教堂里的老鼠。啊！如果我娶科尔蒙小姐，如果我能再成为有钱人，那我当然会把你放在赛查丽娜之上了。在我看来你一直像在铅上镀的金子那样美好，你天生就该是一位贵族大老爷的心上人。我知道你很聪明，你跟我玩这个小花招，我一点也不惊讶，我早就料到了。你这是丢了剑拿剑鞘出招，对于一个姑娘来说是多么胆大的一件事啊。这可是主意高明的勇敢之人才能做到的，我的小天使，因此你赢得了我的尊重。”","“We slander ourselves,” he said with inimitable craft; “we are as virtuous as that beautiful biblical girl whose name we bear; we can always marry as we please, but we are thirsty for Paris, where charming creatures—and we are no fool—get rich without trouble.We want to go and see if the great capital of pleasures hasn’t some young Chevalier de Valois in store for us, with a carriage, diamonds, an opera-box, and so forth.Russians, Austrians, Britons, have millions on which we have an eye.Besides, we are patriotic; we want to help France in getting back her money from the pockets of those gentry.Hey! Hey! My dear little devil’s duck! It isn’t a bad plan.The world you live in may cry out a bit, but success justifies all things.The worst thing in this world, my dear, is to be without money; that’s our disease, yours and mine.Now inasmuch as we have plenty of wit, we thought it would be a good thing to parade our dear little honor, or dishonor, to catch an old boy; but that old boy, my dear heart, knows the Alpha and Omega of female tricks,—which means that you could easier put salt on a sparrow’s tail than to make me believe I have anything to do with your little affair.Go to Paris, my dear; go at the cost of an old celibate, I won’t prevent it; in fact, I’ll help you, for an old bachelor, Suzanne, is the natural money-box of a young girl. But don’t drag me into the matter.Listen, my queen, you who know life pretty well; you would me great harm and give me much pain,—harm, because you would prevent my marriage in a town where people cling to morality; pain, because if you are in trouble (which I deny, you sly puss!) I haven’t a penny to get you out of it.I’m as poor as a church mouse; you know that, my dear.Ah! If I marry Mademoiselle Cormon, if I am once more rich, of course I would prefer you to Cesarine.You’ve always seemed to me as fine as the gold they gild on lead; you were made to be the love of a great seigneur.I think you so clever that the trick you are trying to play off on me doesn’t surprise me one bit; I expected it.You are flinging the scabbard after the sword, and that’s daring for a girl.It takes nerve and superior ideas to do it, my angel, and therefore you have won my respectful esteem.”"
"“骑士先生，我向您保证，您误会我了，而且——”","“Monsieur le chevalier, I assure you, you are mistaken, and—”"
"她脸红了，不敢再说下去。骑士仅看了一眼，就已想到并猜透了她的整个计划。“对，对！我明白，你要我相信你的话。”他说，“好！我相信你。但是你要听我的话：到迪布斯基耶先生家去。你往他家送衣服也有六个或八个月了吧？我不会问你们之间发生了什么，但是我知道他是个极其自负的老光棍，并且很有钱，他只花他那宽裕收入的四分之一。如果你真像我想象得那么聪明，你可以靠他的钱去巴黎。去吧，我的小鹿，去缠住他，让他逃不出你的手心。不过要记住：你要像丝绸一样柔顺，他每说上一句，你都要给他绕上两圈，打上一个结。他是很怕别人说闲话的人，如果他让你抓着了把柄——总之，你应该明白，你就威胁他说要去找慈善事务所的女士们。另外，他是个野心勃勃的人。一个男人就应该靠他的老婆成功，你这么漂亮、聪明，足以帮你丈夫发财了。嘿，你这个小淘气！你简直可以和所有宫廷里的女人相抗争呢！”","She colored, and did not dare to say more.The chevalier, with a single glance, had guessed and fathomed her whole plan.“Yes, yes! I understand: you want me to believe it,” he said.“Well! I do believe it.But take my advice: go to Monsieur du Bousquier.Haven’t you taken linen there for the last six or eight months?I’m not asking what went on between you; but I know the man: he has immense conceit; he is an old bachelor, and very rich; and he only spends a quarter of a comfortable income.If you are as clever as I suppose, you can go to Paris at his expense.There, run along, my little doe; go and twist him round your finger.Only, mind this: be as supple as silk; at every word take a double turn round him and make a knot.He is a man to fear scandal, and if he has given you a chance to put him in the pillory—in short, understand; threaten him with the ladies of the Maternity Hospital.Besides, he’s ambitious.A man succeeds through his wife, and you are handsome and clever enough to make the fortune of a husband.Hey! The mischief! You could hold your own against all the court ladies.”"
"听了骑士的这番话，苏珊茅塞顿开，巴不得马上去找迪布斯基耶。为了不至于离开得太突然，她一面帮骑士穿衣服，一面向骑士了解些巴黎的情况。不过，骑士早知道苏珊听了他的话后会迫不及待地想离开，于是很好心地请她去告诉赛查丽娜，让她把拉尔多太太每日清晨给他做好的可可饮料送上楼来。于是苏珊急忙离开去钓她的新“大鱼”了。下面我们来了解一下她这条“大鱼”的背景。","Suzanne, whose mind took in at a flash the chevalier’s last words, was eager to run off to du Bousquier, but, not wishing to depart too abruptly, she questioned the chevalier about Paris, all the while helping him to dress.The chevalier, however, divined her desire to be off, and favored it by asking her to tell Cesarine to bring up his chocolate, which Madame Lardot made for him every morning.Suzanne then slipped away to her new victim, whose biography must here be given."
"迪布斯基耶出生于阿郎松的一个介于资产阶级和地主乡绅之间的古老世家。父亲死后，迪布斯基耶在生活上无依无靠，于是就像其他破产的外省人一样，去了巴黎。法国大革命爆发之际，他进入了商界。当时，尽管共和党严格按照革命的规章秉公办事，商界却一点儿也不清白。政治间谍、股票投机商、承包商、与市镇上管理钱财的人相互勾搭并没收那些逃亡的贵族的财产以便将其买进或卖出的人，以及部长和将军，这些人全都一样在商界搅和着。从一七九三年到一七九九年，迪布斯基耶负责法国军队的粮食供应。他有一所豪华的大公馆，是商界的一大巨头。他与乌弗拉尔做买卖，宾客盈门，过着肆无忌惮的生活——一如不费吹灰之力便粮食满仓、情妇满屋的辛辛那蒂斯的生活。家中经常为共和党要人举行盛大宴会。","Born of an old Alencon family, du Bousquier was a cross between the bourgeois and the country squire.Finding himself without means on the death of his father, he went, like other ruined provincials, to Paris.On the breaking out of the Revolution he took part in public affairs.In spite of revolutionary principles, which made a hobby of republican honesty, the management of public business in those days was by no means clean.A political spy, a stock-jobber, a contractor, a man who confiscated in collusion with the syndic of a commune the property of emigres in order to sell them and buy them in, a minister, and a general were all equally engaged in public business.From 1793 to 1799 du Bousquier was commissary of provisions to the French armies.He lived in a magnificent hotel and was one of the matadors of finance, did business with Ouvrard, kept open house, and led the scandalous life of the period,—the life of a Cincinnatus, on sacks of corn harvested without trouble, stolen rations, “little houses” full of mistresses, in which were given splendid fetes to the Directors of the Republic."
"迪布斯基耶公民是巴拉斯的熟人，与富歇交情甚好，和贝纳多特也颇有交情。他完全相信自己有望当部长，只要他能投到马郎戈战役以前秘密反对波拿巴的那一派里。如果不是凯勒曼发起攻击，德赛战死了，迪布斯基耶很可能会成为部长。他是反拿破仑秘密政府中的一位高官。可惜拿破仑的运气让这个政府在一七九三年胎死腹中。（参见《一桩神秘案件》）马郎戈战役出人意料的胜利宣布了这个党派的失败。他们早已印刷好了声明，准备一旦第一执政战场失利，便回到山岳派的体制。","The citizen du Bousquier was one of Barras’ familiars; he was on the best of terms with Fouche, stood very well with Bernadotte, and fully expected to become a minister by throwing himself into the party which secretly caballed against Bonaparte until Marengo.If it had not been for Kellermann’s charge and Desaix’s death, du Bousquier would probably have become a minister.He was one of the chief assistances of that secret government whom Napoleon’s luck send behind the scenes in 1793.（See “An Historical Mystery.”)The unexpected victory of Marengo was the defeat of that party who actually had their proclamations printed to return to the principles of the Montagne in case the First Consul succumbed."
"迪布斯基耶深信拿破仑不可能取胜，因而拿自己的大部分财产在交易场所做空头，并且在战场上留下了两个信使。第一个信使于梅拉斯取胜时动身来巴黎报信。第二个使者在四小时后动身，宣告奥军大败。迪布斯基耶对凯勒曼和德赛大肆诅咒，但他不敢诅咒波拿巴，因为这个第一执政官欠他数百万法郎。本来是要赚几百万的，结果却破产了，这一骤变让这个承包商失去了思考能力，一连数日痴痴呆呆。他生活放纵无度，身体早已透支，这一晴天霹雳让他无力还击。他对未来还抱有一丝希望，那就是国家债券清算的结果。他想尽办法贿赂拿破仑，但是拿破仑痛恨这些企图利用他战场失利做投机买卖的承包商，于是迪巴斯基耶先生一个子儿也没有剩下。这个承包商生活糜烂，又与巴拉斯和贝纳多特颇为亲近，比起他在交易所做空头来，这两点更让第一执政官不悦，于是他将迪布斯基耶的名字从收取国库银钱者的 名单上划掉了。","Convinced of the impossibility of Bonaparte’s triumph, du Bousquier staked the greater part of his property on a fall in the Funds, and kept two couriers on the field of battle.The first started for Paris when Melas’ victory was certain; the second, starting four hours later, brought the news of the defeat of the Austrians.Du Bousquier cursed Kellermann and Desaix; he dared not curse Bonaparte, who might owe him millions.This alternative of millions to be earned and present ruin staring him in the face, deprived the purveyor of most of his faculties: he became nearly imbecile for several days; the man had so abused his health by excesses that when the thunderbolt fell upon him he had no strength to resist.The payment of his bills against the Exchequer gave him some hopes for the future, but, in spite of all efforts to ingratiate himself, Napoleon’s hatred to the contractors who had speculated on his defeat made itself felt; du Bousquier was left without a sou.The immorality of his private life, his intimacy with Barras and Bernadotte, displeased the First Consul even more than his manoeuvres at the Bourse, and he struck du Bousquier’s name from the list of the government contractors."
"迪布斯基耶的往日豪富只剩下他从国库储蓄中获得的每年一千二百法郎，这是他从前一时心血来潮存储在国库的，现在倒使他免于一贫如洗。他现在回到了阿郎松，在这个保王党暗中统治的城市生活。这个让第一执政给搞垮的人激起了阿郎松人的极大兴趣。迪布斯基耶恨透了波拿马，他专门讲些有关第一执政官的卑贱琐事，谈约瑟菲娜的放荡生活和十年革命期间的各种丑陋秘闻等等，这使他大受欢迎。","Out of all his past opulence du Bousquier saved only twelve hundred francs a year from an investment in the Grand Livre, which he had happened to place there by pure caprice, and which saved him from penury.A man ruined by the First Consul interested the town of Alencon, to which he now returned, where royalism was secretly dominant.Du Bousquier, furious against Bonaparte, relating stories against him of his meanness, of Josephine’s improprieties, and all the other scandalous anecdotes of the last ten years, was well received."
"这时迪布斯基耶先生已经四十多岁了，但他却以三十六岁的单身汉身份出现。他中等身材，像个商人那样身材臃肿，露出矫健的腿肚子。他的容貌特征鲜明：鼻子扁平，鼻孔内多毛；黑眼珠，浓密的眼睫毛，眼中投射出精明的目光，很像是德塔列朗先生的目光，但有些呆滞。他还留着共和党人的两撇胡子，蓄着长头发。他的手，每个手指节上都长着一小撮毛，青筋突起，证明肌肉很扎实。他的胸膛堪比法尔奈斯宫里赫丘利的雕像，他的肩膀足以扛起货物。这种肩膀现在只能在托尔托尼咖啡馆才能见到了。迪布斯基耶旺盛的男士生命力对他与其他人的交往有重要意义。像德瓦卢瓦骑士一样，迪布斯基耶也有着和他的整个面貌形成鲜明对照的特征。这位前商人没有与他的肌肉相称的嗓音。这倒不是说他的嗓音很细，像我们有时听海象口中发出的那样；恰好相反，他是压低了的大嗓门，类似于用锯锯一块浸湿了的软木头的声音——这就是穷困潦倒的投机商的嗓音。","About this time, when he was somewhere between forty and fifty, du Bousquier’s appearance was that of a bachelor of thirty-six, of medium height, plump as a purveyor, proud of his vigorous calves, with a strongly marked countenance, a flattened nose, the nostrils garnished with hair, black eyes with thick lashes, from which darted shrewd glances like those of Monsieur de Talleyrand, though somewhat dulled.He still wore republican whiskers and his hair very long; his hands, adorned with bunches of hair on each knuckle, showed the power of his muscular system in their prominent blue veins.He had the chest of the Farnese Hercules, and shoulders fit to carry the stocks.Such shoulders are seen nowadays only at Tortoni’s.This wealth of masculine vigor counted for much in du Bousquier’s relations with others.And yet in him, as in the chevalier, symptoms appeared which contrasted oddly with the general aspect of their persons.The late purveyor had not the voice of his muscles.We do not mean that his voice was a mere thread, such as we sometimes hear issuing from the mouth of these walruses; on the contrary, it was a strong voice, but stifled, an idea of which can be given only by comparing it with the noise of a saw cutting into soft and moistened wood,—the voice of a worn-out speculator."
"虽然对第一执政官的仇恨让他得以进入外省保王党权威人士界，但是构成阿郎松圣日耳曼区的七、八户人家却从未招待过他，而德瓦卢瓦骑士倒是颇受这些人家的欢迎。迪布斯基耶曾通过阿芒德小姐的公证人提出要娶她为妻，这位小姐是城中最受敬重的一位贵族的胞妹，但他遭到了拒绝。在阿郎松有十几家富户，从前是他们造就了阿郎松这座城市的中心。他们拥有草场和牛群，经营大宗布料批发生意。他极力自我安慰，希望能在这些人家中娶到一位有钱的太太。事实上，现在他的所有希望都寄托在有一桩美满婚姻的前景上了。他不是没有理财能力，很多人借此得到了好处。他像是破产了的赌徒指点新手一样，告诉别人如何投机做生意，采用什么办法以及可行性如何。人们认为他是个优秀的管理人员，经常有任命他为阿郎松市长的想法。但是人们还记得他在共和党内搞投机的事，因此他从未得到省政府的批准。之后的各界政府，甚至包括“百日政府”，都拒绝任命他为阿郎松市市长。这个职位他垂涎已久，心想如果他得到了这个职位，说不定早已和他相中的哪一位老姑娘喜结良缘了。","In spite of the claims which the enmity of the First Consul gave Monsieur du Bousquier to enter the royalist society of the province, he was not received in the seven or eight families who composed the faubourg Saint-Germain of Alencon, among whom the Chevalier de Valois was welcome.He had offered himself in marriage, through her notary, to Mademoiselle Armande, sister of the most distinguished noble in the town; to which offer he received a refusal.He consoled himself as best he could in the society of a dozen rich families, former manufacturers of the old point d’Alencon, owners of pastures and cattle, or merchants doing a wholesale business in linen, among whom, as he hoped, he might find a wealthy wife.In fact, all his hopes now converged to the perspective of a fortunate marriage.He was not without a certain financial ability, which many persons used to their profit.Like a ruined gambler who advises neophytes, he pointed out enterprises and speculations, together with the means and chances of conducting them.He was thought a good administrator, and it was often a question of making him mayor of Alencon; but the memory of his underhand jobbery still clung to him, and he was never received at the prefecture.All the succeeding governments, even that of the Hundred Days, refused to appoint him mayor of Alencon,—a place he coveted, which, could he have had it, would, he thought, have won him the hand of a certain old maid on whom his matrimonial views now turned."
"迪布斯基耶对帝国政府的憎恶先是将他投入了阿郎松保王党的阵营中。虽然他在那里受尽屈辱，但还是留下来了。到波旁王朝第一次复辟时，省政府仍然将他摒除在外，这次拒绝让他内心对波旁王朝深恶痛绝，而他表面上仍然公开支持保王党。现在他又重新忠于自己以前的政见了，成了阿郎松自由党的领袖。他暗中操纵选举，通过背地里的策划和表面上虚伪的活动，对复辟王朝造成了巨大的破坏。像每一个仅凭借自己头脑过活的人一样，迪布斯基耶的仇恨像平静的小溪一样，虽然水流不大，但却是无穷无尽的。他的仇恨像黑人一样，如此平静，骗过了敌人。他的复仇酝酿了十五年之久，从未有哪次胜利能让他满足，甚至连一八三零年七月的那次胜利也不行。","Du Bousquier’s aversion to the Imperial government had thrown him at first into the royalist circles of Alencon, where he remained in spite of the rebuffs he received there; but when, after the first return of the Bourbons, he was still excluded from the prefecture, that mortification inspired him with a hatred as deep as it was secret against the royalists.He now returned to his old opinions, and became the leader of the liberal party in Alencon, the invisible manipulator of elections, and did immense harm to the Restoration by the cleverness of his underhand proceedings and the perfidy of his outward behavior.Du Bousquier, like all those who live by their heads only, carried on his hatreds with the quiet tranquillity of a rivulet, feeble apparently, but inexhaustible.His hatred was that of a negro, so peaceful that it deceived the enemy.His vengeance, brooded over for fifteen years, was as yet satisfied by no victory, not even that of July, 1830."
"德瓦卢瓦骑士让苏珊去迪布斯基耶家还是有他自己的用意的。他们俩一个是自由党，一个是保王党。他们早已猜到了对方的想法，尽管在全城人面前双方都将他们共同的希望隐藏起来了。他们两个老光棍私底下是情敌。他们都制订了娶科尔蒙小姐的计划，刚才德瓦卢瓦骑士也对苏珊提到了这位小姐。他们俩都打定了主意，而表面上却装作漠不关心，实际上都是在等待某个好时机把那位老姑娘送到他们手上。因此，即使没有他们分别生动体现的两种政治体制的距离，他们这私下的竞争也会使他们成为仇敌。时代给人们打上了深深的烙印。这两个人就证明了这句格言，他们的容貌、言谈、思想和装束所显出的历史色调完全不同。一个是粗鲁、精力充沛、举止夸张和鲁莽的人，说话短促而生硬，语气深沉，深色头发，眼神阴暗；表面上令人畏惧，实际上却像共和党暴动一样软弱无力。另一个则是温文尔雅、彬彬有礼、风度翩翩、性情温和，通过缓慢而有效的外交手段来达成目的，保持高雅的品味，是老式阿谀奉承的典型。","It was not without some private intention that the Chevalier de Valois had turned Suzanne’s designs upon Monsieur du Bousquier.The liberal and the royalist had mutually divined each other in spite of the wide dissimulation with which they hid their common hope from the rest of the town.The two old bachelors were secretly rivals.Each had formed a plan to marry the Demoiselle Cormon, whom Monsieur de Valois had mentioned to Suzanne.Both, ensconced in their idea and wearing the armor of apparent indifference, awaited the moment when some lucky chance might deliver the old maid over to them.Thus, if the two old bachelors had not been kept asunder by the two political systems of which they each offered a living expression, their private rivalry would still have made them enemies.Epochs put their mark on men.These two individuals proved the truth of that axiom by the opposing historic tints that were visible in their faces, in their conversation, in their ideas, and in their clothes.One, abrupt, energetic, with loud, brusque manners, curt, rude speech, dark in tone, in hair, in look, terrible apparently, in reality as impotent as an insurrection, represented the republic admirably.The other, gentle and polished, elegant and nice, attaining his ends by the slow and infallible means of diplomacy, faithful to good taste, was the express image of the old courtier regime."
"这两个敌手几乎每晚都在同一地方相遇。骑士争战是客气而温和的，而迪布斯基耶却不怎么讲究礼仪，尽管他为了不被赶走而保留着交际场合所必需的表面功夫。他们两人完全了解对方。尽管外省人对于关乎他们生活重心的细微利害关系观察得十分细致，却没有人怀疑这两人之间存在竞争。德瓦卢瓦骑士更占上风：他从来没有向科尔蒙小姐求过婚；而迪布斯基耶想登上当地最上层贵族的家门不成功后也加入到食客的行列中了，他的求婚遭到了拒绝。但是骑士认为他的对手还是有很大的可能性成功，因此他让苏珊去给他的对手一击（即雅尔纳），这将是用精心准备的利刃深深的一击。骑士早已用探测锤计量过迪布斯基耶的深浅了，随着故事的发展，我们可以看到他的推测都是准确无误的。","The two enemies met nearly every evening on the same ground.The war was courteous and benign on the side of the chevalier; but du Bousquier showed less ceremony on his, though still preserving the outward appearances demanded by society, for he did not wish to be driven from the place.They themselves fully understood each other; but in spite of the shrewd observation which provincials bestow on the petty interests of their own little centre, no one in the town suspected the rivalry of these two men.Monsieur le Chevalier de Valois occupied a vantage-ground: he had never asked for the hand of Mademoiselle Cormon; whereas du Bousquier, who entered the lists soon after his rejection by the most distinguished family in the place, had been refused.But the chevalier believed that his rival had still such strong chances of success that he dealt him this coup de Jarnac with a blade (namely, Suzanne) that was finely tempered for the purpose.The chevalier had cast his plummet-line into the waters of du Bousquier; and, as we shall see by the sequel, he was not mistaken in any of his conjectures."
"苏珊步履轻盈地从河道街出发，经过塞镇门大街和羊圈街，一直走到天鹅街。大约五年前，迪布斯基耶在天鹅街买下了这栋小房屋，是用灰色岩石盖成的，与诺曼底大理石的碎石或布列塔尼的板岩碎石相似。这位前商人比城里任何人都要住得舒服，因为他设法留下了一些自己辉煌时期的家具和装饰品。这位倒台的沙达那帕鲁斯，外省的道德规范正在逐渐磨损他的光辉。往日豪华的生活遗迹摆放在他的房屋中，就有如将一盏华丽的支形吊灯放在仓房里。无论是大东西还是小东西都缺乏和谐感，而和谐是一切艺术品的纽带，无论是人间还是仙境。人人都不擦鞋便上楼，楼梯从未被擦洗过。墙壁是请了当地一位可怜的画家画的，简直不堪入目。石砌壁炉，雕刻得很糟，却“挂着”华丽的挂钟，而附近粗劣的烛台又让挂钟逊色不少。正如迪布斯基耶自身所代表的时代一样，这房子也是肮脏和华丽的大杂烩。大家都认为迪布斯基耶是生活富足的人，他也过着骑士一样的食客生活，而且他是不花自己钱的富人。他唯一的仆人勒内是当地的一个小伙，相当笨，迪布斯基耶慢慢地训练他按照主人的要求做事，费了不少心思。他像教猩猩那样教他的仆人擦洗房间地面，给家具除尘，给他的靴子上油，刷净衣服，晚上如果天阴的话带灯笼去接主人回家，下雨要带木底鞋。和其他人一样，这个小伙子天生有种恶习，他非常贪吃。迪布斯基耶去参加盛大宴会时经常带着勒内，并且往往让他脱下那件蓝色的棉布夹克，上面有一个大口袋垂到腰间，里面总是鼓鼓囊囊地装着手绢、木柄小刀、水果或是一小包坚果，而要求他穿上仆人的号衣。勒内每次都能和其他仆人大吃一顿。迪布斯基耶把仆人的职责变成了对他的一种奖励，换来了这个布列塔尼仆人对主人的事守口如瓶。","Suzanne tripped with a light foot from the rue du Cours, by the rue de la Porte de Seez and the rue du Bercail, to the rue du Cygne, where, about five years earlier, du Bousquier had bought a little house built of gray Jura stone, which is something between Breton slate and Norman granite.There he established himself more comfortably than any householder in town; for he had managed to preserve certain furniture and decorations from the days of his splendor.But provincial manners and morals obscured, little by little, the rays of this fallen Sardanapalus; these vestiges of his former luxury now produced the effect of a glass chandelier in a barn.Harmony, that bond of all work, human or divine, was lacking in great things as well as in little ones.The stairs, up which everybody mounted without wiping their feet, were never polished; the walls, painted by some wretched artisan of the neighborhood, were a terror to the eye; the stone mantel-piece, ill-carved, “swore” with the handsome clock, which was further degraded by the company of contemptible candlesticks.Like the period which du Bousquier himself represented, the house was a jumble of dirt and magnificence.Being considered a man of leisure, du Bousquier led the same parasite life as the chevalier; and he who does not spend his income is always rich.His only servant was a sort of Jocrisse, a lad of the neighborhood, rather a ninny, trained slowly and with difficulty to du Bousquier’s requirements.His master had taught him, as he might an orang-outang, to rub the floors, dust the furniture, black his boots, brush his coats, and bring a lantern to guide him home at night if the weather were cloudy, and clogs if it rained.Like many other human beings, this lad hadn’t stuff enough in him for more than one vice; he was a glutton.Often, when du Bousquier went to a grand dinner, he would take Rene to wait at table; on such occasions he made him take off his blue cotton jacket, with its big pockets hanging round his hips, and always bulging with handkerchiefs, clasp-knives, fruits, or a handful of nuts, and forced him to put on a regulation coat.Rene would then stuff his fill with the other servants.This duty, which du Bousquier had turned into a reward, won him the most absolute discretion from the Breton servant."
"“您来了，小姐！”勒内见苏珊走进来，说道，“今天不是您来取衣服的日子。我们没有要洗的衣服，您回去告诉拉尔多太太吧。”“大傻瓜！”苏珊哈哈大笑道。","“You here, mademoiselle!” said Rene to Suzanne when she entered; “’t ’isn’t your day.We haven’t any linen for the wash, tell Madame Lardot.”“Old stupid!” said Suzanne, laughing."
"这俊俏的姑娘上楼去了，让勒内吃完他那碗煮牛奶加荞麦。迪布斯基耶还躺在床上想着他的赚钱计划，像其他已将享乐之橙榨干的人一样，他现在只剩下野心了。野心和赌博是无休止的，一个头脑清醒的人来自头脑的激情总会比心中迸发的激情更持久。","The pretty girl went upstairs, leaving Rene to finish his porringer of buckwheat in boiled milk.Du Bousquier, still in bed, was revolving in his mind his plans of fortune; for ambition was all that was left to him, as to other men who have sucked dry the orange of pleasure.Ambition and play are inexhaustible; in a well-organized man the passions which proceed from the brain will always survive the passions of the heart."
"“我来了。”苏珊说道，一边坐在床上，粗暴地撩起床帐挂在帐勾上，帐子被弄得唏哩哗啦乱响。","“Here am I,” said Suzanne, sitting down on the bed and jangling the curtain-rings back along the rod with despotic vehemence."
"“怎么了，我的小可爱？”这老光棍起身说道。","“Quesaco, my charmer?” said the old bachelor, sitting up in bed."
"“先生，”苏珊郑重其事地说道，“您肯定奇怪我怎么这个时候来您这儿吧，但是我现在的处境让我顾不上别人的闲言闲语了。”","“Monsieur,” said Suzanne, gravely, “you must be astonished to see me here at this hour; but I find myself in a condition which obliges me not to care for what people may say about it.”"
"“到底怎么了？”迪布斯基耶叉起双臂来问道。","“What does all that mean?” said du Bousquier, crossing his arms."
"“您难道不明白吗？”苏珊说。“我知道，”她做出可爱的样子，接着说道，“一个可怜的姑娘为了一些在您看来是些鸡毛蒜皮的小事来麻烦一个男人，让人觉得多么可笑。但是如果您真的很了解我，先生，如果您知道我会为一个像我眷恋您一样眷恋我的男人所做的事，您要是娶了我绝对不会后悔。当然不是在阿郎松，在这里我对您不会有多大用处。但是如果我们去巴黎，趁着现在政府彻底改组的时候，您就会看到我能把一个像您这般有头脑有能力的男人抬到多高。因此——只有咱俩知道——难道我和您说的这事是坏事吗？这不应该是件大好事吗，能大大回报您的，不是吗？您现在为谁、为什么工作呢？”","“Don’t you understand me?” said Suzanne.“I know,” she continued, making a pretty little face, “how ridiculous it is in a poor girl to come and nag at a man for what he thinks a mere nothing.But if you really knew me, monsieur, if you knew all that I am capable of for a man who would attach himself to me as much as I’m attached to you, you would never repent having married me.Of course it isn’t here, in Alencon, that I should be of service to you; but if we went to Paris, you would see where I could lead a man with your mind and your capacities; and just at this time too, when they are remaking the government from top to toe.So—between ourselves, be it said—IS what has happened a misfortune?Isn’t it rather a piece of luck, which will pay you well?Who and what are you working for now?”"
"“当然为我自己！”迪布斯基耶粗暴地喊道。“混蛋！你会断子绝孙的！”苏珊以先知诅咒的腔调说道。","“For myself, of course!” cried du Bousquier, brutally.""Monster! you’ll never be a father!” said Suzanne, giving a tone of prophetic malediction to the words."
"“好了，不说蠢话了，苏珊，”迪布斯基耶说道，“我觉得我还在做梦呢。”","“Come, don’t talk nonsense, Suzanne,” replied du Bousquier; “I really think I am still dreaming.”"
"“您还要看什么样的现实呢？”苏珊站起来喊道。","“How much more reality do you want?” cried Suzanne, standing up."
"迪布斯基耶来回地揉搓着头上的睡帽，明显表明他内心思绪翻腾。","Du Bousquier rubbed his cotton night-cap to the top of his head with a rotatory motion, which plainly indicated the tremendous fermentation of his ideas."
"“他真相信了！”苏珊心想，“还美滋滋的呢。天哪，要骗男人上钩还真容易呀！”“苏珊，见鬼，我到底要怎么办呢？这真是太突然了，我还以为……事实是……不，不，这不可能呀……”","“He actually believes it!” thought Suzanne, “and he’s flattered. Heaven! How easy it is to gull men!”“Suzanne, what the devil must I do?It is so extraordinary—I, who thought—The fact is that—No, no, it can’t be—”"
"“怎么，您不能娶我吗？”","""What? You can’t marry me?”"
"“哦，不行啊，我已经有婚约了。”","""Oh! As for that, no; I have engagements.”"
"“是和阿芒德小姐，还是和科尔蒙小姐？这两个人不都已经拒绝您了吗？听我说，迪布斯基耶先生，无需宪兵，光是我的声誉就能把您拽到市政府去。而且感谢上帝，我绝对不会嫁不出去！而且，我也绝对不要一个不能欣赏我的男人。但是您将来会后悔您现在的决定的，如果您今天拒绝我，那您以后用金子、银子，世界上任何东西都打动不了我，让我再回心转意了！”","“With Mademoiselle Armande or Mademoiselle Cormon, who have both refused you?Listen to me, Monsieur du Bousquier, my honor doesn’t need gendarmes to drag you to the mayor’s office.I sha’n’t lack for husbands, thank goodness! And I don’t want a man who can’t appreciate what I’m worth.But some day you’ll repent of the way you are behaving; for I tell you now that nothing on earth, neither gold nor silver, will induce me to return the good thing that belongs to you, if you refuse to accept it to-day.”"
"“但是，苏珊，你肯定吗？”","“But, Suzanne, are you sure?”"
"“哦，先生！”这女工喊道，把自己的贞洁摆出来，“您把我当什么人了？我不需要提醒您以前给我许下的那些诺言，但是那些承诺已经毁了这个可怜的年轻姑娘，她唯一的缺点就是爱得太痴情了。”","“Oh, monsieur!” cried the grisette, wrapping her virtue round her, “what do you take me for?I don’t remind you of the promises you made me, which have ruined a poor young girl whose only blame was to have as much ambition as love.”"
"迪布斯基耶此刻思绪万千，既高兴，又怀疑，还在算计。他早已决定要娶科尔蒙小姐，因为宪章（他刚才还在反复琢磨这宪章）为他当议员的野心提供了政治道路，只要凭着那老姑娘的一半财产就可以实现。另外，他和那老姑娘结婚可以大大提高他在城里的地位，让他极具影响力。因此，狡猾的苏珊掀起的这场暴风雨让他陷入最尴尬的境地。如果没有他那秘密的企图，他大可毫不犹豫地娶苏珊为妻。这样的话，他可以公开就职阿郎松自由党领导人的职位。娶了苏珊后，他很可能要放弃第一流的社会交际，并且与批发商、富有的制造商和牧场主构成的资产阶级为伍了，这个阶层的人肯定会因为他是他们的候选人而欢呼不已。迪布斯基耶已经预见了左翼的形势。","Du Bousquier was torn with conflicting sentiments, joy, distrust, calculation.He had long determined to marry Mademoiselle Cormon; for the Charter, on which he had just been ruminating, offered to his ambition, through the half of her property, the political career of a deputy.Besides, his marriage with the old maid would put him socially so high in the town that he would have great influence.Consequently, the storm upraised by that malicious Suzanne drove him into the wildest embarrassment.Without this secret scheme, he would have married Suzanne without hesitation.In which case, he could openly assume the leadership of the liberal party in Alencon.After such a marriage he would, of course, renounce the best society and take up with the bourgeois class of tradesmen, rich manufacturers and graziers, who would certainly carry him in triumph as their candidate.Du Bousquier already foresaw the Left side."
"他严肃地盘算着，也不掩饰他的想法。他手摸头顶，拿下睡帽，露出他那难看的光头。同时，像所有超过预期所得的人一样，苏珊沉默着，感到很惊讶。为了掩饰她的惊讶，她摆出一副受奸污的姑娘站在诱惑她的男人面前那种楚楚可怜的姿态，而内心却像个女工那样在暗自得意自己小手腕儿的高明。","This solemn deliberation he did not conceal; he rubbed his hands over his head, displacing the cap which covered its disastrous baldness.Suzanne, meantime, like all those persons who succeed beyond their hopes, was silent and amazed.To hide her astonishment, she assumed the melancholy pose of an injured girl at the mercy of her seducer; inwardly she was laughing like a grisette at her clever trick."
"“我亲爱的孩子，”迪布斯基耶终于开口了，“我可不会上你的当，我绝对不会！”","“My dear child,” said du Bousquier at length, “I’m not to be taken in with such BOSH, not I!”"
"他的考虑以这句简短的话结束。他属于一派玩世不恭的哲学家类别，这类人将女人完全归为“可疑分子”一类，绝对不愿受女人的摆布。这些意志坚强的人通常是些软弱的男人，对女人有他们自己的一套信条。在他们看来，从法兰西王后到经营女装的女商人在内的所有女人，基本上都是堕落的荡妇，是极具诱惑的无赖骗子，是只能考虑鸡毛蒜皮小事的无能者。在他们看来，女人专干坏事，就应该让她们跳舞、唱歌、放声大笑。在女人身上他们看不到任何圣洁或伟大的东西。在他们看来，女人根本无法给人以感官上的诗意，仅仅是粗俗的性感而已。在他们这种法则之下，不是女人始终受到男人专横暴虐的对待，就是男人沦为女人的奴隶。在这方面，迪布斯基耶又和骑士相反了。在他说完这句话的时候，他将自己的睡帽摔到床脚下，就像格列高利教皇宣布驱逐某人出教会时将蜡烛打翻一样。这时苏珊才知道，原来这老光棍平时都是戴假发的。","Such was the curt remark which ended du Bousquier’s meditation.He plumed himself on belonging to the class of cynical philosophers who could never be “taken in” by women,—putting them, one and all, unto the same category, as SUSPICIOUS.These strong-minded persons are usually weak men who have a special catechism in the matter of womenkind.To them the whole sex, from queens of France to milliners, are essentially depraved, licentious, intriguing, not a little rascally, fundamentally deceitful, and incapable of thought about anything but trifles.To them, women are evil-doing queens, who must be allowed to dance and sing and laugh as they please; they see nothing sacred or saintly in them, nor anything grand; to them there is no poetry in the senses, only gross sensuality.Where such jurisprudence prevails, if a woman is not perpetually tyrannized over, she reduces the man to the condition of a slave.Under this aspect du Bousquier was again the antithesis of the chevalier.When he made his final remark, he flung his night-cap to the foot of the bed, as Pope Gregory did the taper when he fulminated an excommunication; Suzanne then learned for the first time that du Bousquier wore a toupet covering his bald spot."
"“您要记住，迪布斯基耶先生，”苏珊威严地说道，“我来这里和你说这件事是尽了自己的义务，您要记住我本来是要嫁给您的，要求您娶我。但是也请您记住，我是带着自重自爱的女子的尊严来和您说这些话的。我没有降低自己的身份，像傻瓜一样哭哭啼啼，我也没有过分坚持，我一点也没有纠缠您。现在您已经知道我的处境了。您知道，我在阿郎松呆不下去了，我妈妈会打我，拉尔多太太会严格按照她的原则办事，将我开除的。像我这样可怜的女工，要进医院吗？要去乞讨吗？不！我宁愿跳亮河或萨尔特河自尽去。但是，我去巴黎不是更好吗？我妈妈可以随便找个借口打发我去那儿——说一个舅舅要我去，或者一个姑妈要死了，或者某位夫人叫我过去。但是我得需要路费和——您知道的。”","“Please to remember, Monsieur du Bousquier,” she replied majestically, “that in coming here to tell you of this matter I have done my duty; remember that I have offered you my hand, and asked for yours; but remember also that I behaved with the dignity of a woman who respects herself.I have not abased myself to weep like a silly fool; I have not insisted; I have not tormented you.You now know my situation.You must see that I cannot stay in Alencon: my mother would beat me, and Madame Lardot rides a hobby of principles; she’ll turn me off.Poor work-girl that I am, must I go to the hospital? Must I beg my bread? No! I’d rather throw myself into the Brillante or the Sarthe.But isn’t it better that I should go to Paris?My mother could find an excuse to send me there,—an uncle who wants me, or a dying aunt, or a lady who sends for me.But I must have some money for the journey and for—you know what.”"
"这个意外的消息令迪布斯基耶大为震惊，远远超过德瓦卢瓦骑士的反应。苏珊的谎言让这老光棍心烦意乱，没办法让自己冷静地思考。如果不是内心慌乱和暗自得意（因为虚荣心总能让人上当），他肯定能想到如果情况是真的，那像苏珊这样没有丧尽天良的女孩是宁愿死上一千遍，也不会来和他这样谈判，向他要钱的。","This extraordinary piece of news was far more startling to du Bousquier than to the Chevalier de Valois.Suzanne’s fiction introduced such confusion into the ideas of the old bachelor that he was literally incapable of sober reflection.Without this agitation and without his inward delight (for vanity is a swindler which never fails of its dupe), he would certainly have reflected that, supposing it were true, a girl like Suzanne, whose heart was not yet spoiled, would have died a thousand deaths before beginning a discussion of this kind and asking for money."
"“那你是真要去巴黎了？”他说。","“Will you really go to Paris, then?” he said."
"听到这句话，苏珊灰色的眼睛一亮，闪过一丝快乐的眼神，但是自鸣得意的迪布斯基耶毫无察觉。","A flash of gayety lighted Suzanne’s gray eyes as she heard these words; but the self-satisfied du Bousquier saw nothing."
"“是的，先生。”她答道。","“Yes, monsieur,” she said."
"于是迪布斯基耶开始诉苦了：说他还没有付清最后一些房款啦，还要付钱给油漆工、泥工和家具商啦，等等。苏珊由他随便说，只等着他给她开个价。迪布斯基耶提出给她三百法郎。苏珊做了一个舞台上称之为“欲撤”的动作，朝门边走去。","Du Bousquier then began bitter lamentations: he had the last payments to make on his house; the painter, the mason, the upholsterers must be paid.Suzanne let him run on; she was listening for the figures.Du Bousquier offered her three hundred francs.Suzanne made what is called on the stage a false exit; that is, she marched toward the door."
"“等等，等等！你要去哪儿？”迪布斯基耶不安地喊道。“这就是老光棍的生活!""他心想。“你瞧！这娘们弄得好像我把她怎么样了似的，我也不过弄皱过她的衣领而已。她竟然就以此为理由来敲诈！”","""Stop, stop! where are you going?” said du Bousquier, uneasily.“This is what comes of a bachelor’s life!” thought he.“The devil take me if I ever did anything more than rumple her collar, and, lo and behold!she makes THAT a ground to put her hand in one’s pocket!”"
"“先生，”苏珊答道，“我要去找妇女协会司库格朗松太太。据我所知，她帮助了很多像我这样走投无路的可怜姑娘。”","“I’m going, monsieur,” replied Suzanne, “to Madame Granson, the treasurer of the Maternity Society, who, to my knowledge, has saved many a poor girl in my condition from suicide.”"
"“格朗松太太！”","“Madame Granson!”"
"“对，”苏珊说，“她是科尔蒙小姐的亲戚，妇女协会的主席。恕我冒昧，城里的妇女们已经建立了一个组织来防止可怜的女人堕胎事件发生。三年前，阿让唐就有个叫福斯汀的漂亮姑娘被弄死了。”","“Yes,” said Suzanne, “a relation of Mademoiselle Cormon, the president of the Maternity Society.Saving your presence, the ladies of the town have created an institution to protect poor creatures from destroying their infants, like that handsome Faustine of Argentan who was executed for it three years ago.”"
"“给，苏珊，”迪布斯基耶给她一把钥匙，说道，“去打开写字台的抽屉，里面有个钱袋，你拿去吧。大概有六百法郎，我就只有这么多了。”","“Here, Suzanne,” said du Bousquier, giving her a key, “open that secretary, and take out the bag you’ll find there: there’s about six hundred francs in it; it is all I possess.”"
"“老骗子！”苏珊一边照做，一边心想，“我会告诉别人你那是假发的。”","“Old cheat!” thought Suzanne, doing as he told her, “I’ll tell about your false toupet.”"
"她将迪布斯基耶和那可爱的骑士先生相比较，虽然确实骑士什么也没给她，但是骑士完全理解她，还给她出主意，把他们这些女工都放在心上。","She compared du Bousquier with that charming chevalier, who had given her nothing, it is true, but who had comprehended her, advised her, and carried all grisettes in his heart."
"“苏珊，你要是骗我，”看着她把手伸入抽屉，迪布斯基耶叫道，“你……”","“If you deceive me, Suzanne,” cried du Bousquier, as he saw her with her hand in the drawer, “you—”"
"“先生，”她放肆地打断他的话，“如果我问你要，难道你会不给吗？”","“Monsieur,” she said, interrupting him with ineffable impertinence, “wouldn’t you have given me money if I had asked for it?”"
"回想起过去情场得意的感觉，迪布斯基耶含糊地应允了。苏珊拿了钱袋走了。临走前还让那老光棍亲了她，而老光棍的神情似乎在说：“这可是我花了高价换来的权利。不过，这总比受指控诱奸少女，让少女犯溺婴罪，而被律师敲一笔要好。”","Recalled to a sense of gallantry, du Bousquier had a remembrance of past happiness and grunted his assent.Suzanne took the bag and departed, after allowing the old bachelor to kiss her, which he did with an air that seemed to say, “It is a right which costs me dear; but it is better than being harried by a lawyer in the court of assizes as the seducer of a girl accused of infanticide.”"
"苏珊将钱袋藏在她胳膊上挎的细藤篮里，心里一直在咒骂着迪布斯基耶的吝啬，她本来想弄到一千法郎的。一旦在开始受邪念驱使就想诈骗到那么多的钱，这姑娘以后一定会胆子更大。在她沿着羊圈街走的时候，她想到由科尔蒙小姐负责的妇女协会说不定能给她补齐她预计去巴黎所需要的数目，这对于阿郎松的女工来说已经是很大一笔钱了。并且，她恨迪布斯基耶那老头。很明显他很怕让格朗松太太知道他行为不正。苏珊就算不能从协会拿到一分钱，她也愿意冒险在离开阿郎松之前，让这个老光棍陷入永远摆不脱的外省的流言蜚语里。所有的女工都天生具有像猴子一样恶作剧的劲头。因此，现在苏珊装出一副最幽怨的样子去见格朗松太太了。","Suzanne hid the sack in a sort of gamebag made of osier which she had on her arm, all the while cursing du Bousquier for his stinginess; for one thousand francs was the sum she wanted.Once tempted of the devil to desire that sum, a girl will go far when she has set foot on the path of trickery.As she made her way along the rue du Bercail, it came into her head that the Maternity Society, presided over by Mademoiselle Cormon, might be induced to complete the sum at which she had reckoned her journey to Paris, which to a grisette of Alencon seemed considerable.Besides, she hated du Bousquier.The latter had evidently feared a revelation of his supposed misconduct to Madame Granson; and Suzanne, at the risk of not getting a penny from the society, was possessed with the desire, on leaving Alencon, of entangling the old bachelor in the inextricable meshes of a provincial slander.In all grisettes there is something of the malevolent mischief of a monkey.Accordingly, Suzanne now went to see Madame Granson, composing her face to an expression of the deepest dejection."
"第三章 阿塔纳斯","CHAPTER III ATHANASE"
"格朗松太太是一位炮兵中校的遗孀，中校战死在耶拿。她每年的生活来源和收入就是微薄的九百法郎的抚恤金和她自己三百法郎的房产收入。另外还要养活他儿子，供他读书，这已经花光了她全部的积蓄。她住在羊圈街一栋房屋的底层。只要你从这小城市的主要街道经过，就可以一眼瞧见那非常寒酸的底层。对街的大门底下有三步很陡的台阶，一条走廊通向内院，尽头的楼梯上是一条木头长廊。走廊的一边是饭厅和厨房，另一边是多用途客厅，以及寡妇的卧室。","Madame Granson, widow of a lieutenant-colonel of artillery killed at Jena, possessed, as her whole means of livelihood, a meagre pension of nine hundred francs a year, and three hundred francs from property of her own, plus a son whose support and education had eaten up all her savings.She occupied, in the rue du Bercail, one of those melancholy ground-floor apartments which a traveller passing along the principal street of a little provincial town can look through at a glance.The street door opened at the top of three steep steps; a passage led to an interior courtyard, at the end of which was the staircase covered by a wooden gallery.On one side of the passage was the dining-room and the kitchen; on the other side, a salon put to many uses, and the widow’s bedchamber."
"她的儿子阿塔纳斯·格朗松是个二十三岁的小伙子，住在房子三楼上面的阁楼里。通过他家亲戚科尔蒙小姐的势力，他获得了一份在市长办公室整理档案的工作，可以为他母亲微薄的收入补贴六百法郎。通过以下的描述，你很容易想象出格朗松太太家的样子：挂着泛黄窗帘的冰冷的客厅，家具上蒙着的乌得勒支丝绒也泛黄了。她把椅子前的小草垫子放平整，以免客人坐着时把红色砖面弄脏了。等客人走后，她坐到放着靠垫的靠背椅上，针线桌就摆在挂在两扇窗户之间的中校遗像下面。从这个地方，她可以将羊圈街一览无余，看见所有来来去去的人。格朗松太太是个好女人，穿着朴素，和她那饱经风霜的苍白面容很相衬。她家里的每一件东西都显得贫穷寒酸，却又让人感觉到外省那正直而严肃的气息。这时他们母子二人正在饭厅里一起吃早餐，每人一杯咖啡，外加小萝卜和抹着黄油的面包。要理解为什么格朗松太太看到苏珊来访会特别高兴，我们必须要先了解这母子二人暗中关心的事。阿塔纳斯·格朗松是个苍白、瘦弱的小伙子，个子中等，双颊凹陷，他的两只乌黑的大眼睛像两块黑炭一样闪着智慧的光芒。他五官不大端正，嘴唇弯曲，下巴突出，前额饱满。因为他自知家境贫寒，而才能又无法得以发展，因此他总是带着忧郁的表情，这些方面都暗示着他受压抑和禁锢的才能。如果在阿郎松之外的任何城市，他仅凭外表就能从上等人士或那些能从平凡无奇中辨识出天才的女士们那里获得帮助。即使他不是天才，他也有着天才的外表；即使他没有伟大心灵所具备的力量，他的眼神也透露出这么一种有力的目光。尽管他能表达最敏锐的感觉，但是胆怯的封套摧毁了他青春的所有光芒，正如贫穷的寒冰冻结了他施展自己所有能力的胆识一样。没有出路、无人欣赏、无人鼓励的外省生活给他的生活划出了一个圈子，他思想的能量还没有萌发就被这个圈子逐渐吞噬了。另外，阿塔纳斯具有一种傲气，这是贫寒对于高尚思想的砥砺，激发他们与人或与事作斗争，尽管一开始会给他们的前进带来障碍。天才有两种发展方式：一种是像拿破仑和莫里哀那样，一旦发现机会就充分施展能力；一种是慢慢显露出来，等待别人来发现自己的天分。年轻的格朗松属于那种不相信自己才能的人，而且容易气馁。他生性爱思考。在生活中，他的想法多于行动。因为他没有法国人那样的激情迸发，因此在一些人眼里他可能是个有缺陷、不完美的人，不属于天才人物。但是他的思维能力确实很强大，而且他可以通过一系列常人感觉不到的情感，得出自己的结论，总能让庸人们感慨：“他疯了”！这个世界对贫穷的蔑视对于阿塔纳斯来说就如死亡一般。孤独的燥热令人萎靡不振，没有呼吸、没有空气的流通，这种生活让本应该绷紧的弓慢慢松弛下来；阿塔纳斯的精神由于徒劳无功的痛苦而倦怠下来。阿塔纳斯本是可以跻身法国高级名流行列的人，但是，尽管他是一只雄鹰，却受困于牢笼，没有得到很好的培养。在终日眼巴巴地凝望着天才人物翱翔的广袤天空和高耸的群山之后，他就快要因饥饿而死。","Athanase Granson, a young man twenty-three years of age, who slept in an attic room above the second floor of the house, added six hundred francs to the income of his poor mother, by the salary of a little place which the influence of his relation, Mademoiselle Cormon, had obtained for him in the mayor’s office, where he was placed in charge of the archives.From these indications it is easy to imagine Madame Granson in her cold salon with its yellow curtains and Utrecht velvet furniture, also yellow, as she straightened the round straw mats which were placed before each chair, that visitors might not soil the red-tiled floor while they sat there; after which she returned to her cushioned armchair and little work-table placed beneath the portrait of the lieutenant-colonel of artillery between two windows,—a point from which her eye could rake the rue du Bercail and see all comers.She was a good woman, dressed with bourgeois simplicity in keeping with her wan face furrowed by grief.The rigorous humbleness of poverty made itself felt in all the accessories of this household, the very air of which was charged with the stern and upright morals of the provinces.At this moment the son and mother were together in the dining-room, where they were breakfasting with a cup of coffee, with bread and butter and radishes.To make the pleasure which Suzanne’s visit was to give to Madame Granson intelligible, we must explain certain secret interests of the mother and son.Athanase Granson was a thin and pale young man, of medium height, with a hollow face in which his two black eyes, sparkling with thoughts, gave the effect of bits of coal.The rather irregular lines of his face, the curve of his lips, a prominent chin, the fine modelling of his forehead, his melancholy countenance, caused by a sense of his poverty warring with the powers that he felt within him, were all indications of repressed and imprisoned talent.In any other place than the town of Alencon the mere aspect of his person would have won him the assistance of superior men, or of women who are able to recognize genius in obscurity.If his was not genius, it was at any rate the form and aspect of it; if he had not the actual force of a great heart, the glow of such a heart was in his glance.Although he was capable of expressing the highest feeling, a casing of timidity destroyed all the graces of his youth, just as the ice of poverty kept him from daring to put forth all his powers.Provincial life, without an opening, without appreciation, without encouragement, described a circle about him in which languished and died the power of thought,—a power which as yet had scarcely reached its dawn.Moreover, Athanase possessed that savage pride which poverty intensifies in noble minds, exalting them in their struggle with men and things; although at their start in life it is an obstacle to their advancement.Genius proceeds in two ways: either it takes its opportunity—like Napoleon, like Moliere—the moment that it sees it, or it waits to be sought when it has patiently revealed itself.Young Granson belonged to that class of men of talent who distrust themselves and are easily discouraged.His soul was contemplative.He lived more by thought than by action.Perhaps he might have seemed deficient or incomplete to those who cannot conceive of genius without the sparkle of French passion; but he was powerful in the world of mind, and he was liable to reach, through a series of emotions imperceptible to common souls, those sudden determinations which make fools say of a man, “He is mad.”The contempt which the world pours out on poverty was death to Athanase; the enervating heat of solitude, without a breath or current of air, relaxed the bow which ever strove to tighten itself; his soul grew weary in this painful effort without results.Athanase was a man who might have taken his place among the glories of France; but, eagle as he was, cooped in a cage without his proper nourishment, he was about to die of hunger after contemplating with an ardent eye the fields of air and the mountain heights where genius soars."
"他在城市图书馆工作，不为人关注。他将出人头地的想法隐藏在内心深处，害怕这会对他不利。但是埋藏在他内心最深处的是一个秘密，与之相伴的激情令他双颊凹陷、额头蜡黄。他爱着自己的远房亲戚，就是德瓦卢瓦骑士和迪布斯基耶觊觎着的科尔蒙小姐，这两个人是他不知道的情敌。这份爱情是从算计开始的。科尔蒙小姐被认为是城里最有钱的人之一，因此这个穷小伙子因为期待物质方面的幸福而倾慕于科尔蒙小姐；同时也由于他一直以来都想要让他的母亲安度晚年。因为他渴望靠思考而生活的人所需要的那种舒适，他逐步爱上了这老姑娘，但是他却因这种最单纯的出发点，看不起自己的爱情。而且，他也害怕世人讥笑他这二十三岁的年轻小伙子爱上了一位四十岁的老姑娘。然而他的感情是真实的。在其他任何地方都可能认为这样一种爱情是不可能的，但在外省却是可能的。在外省，社会风习不会有任何的改变、意外，或是秘密，婚姻成为生活中的必需品。没有哪家会接受一个风流的年轻人做女婿。在巴黎，像阿塔纳斯这样的年轻人和像苏珊这样的俊俏姑娘有男女私情是再自然不过的事了。但在外省却会吓坏父母，并且会断送一个穷小子的婚姻。不过对富豪来说，你的财产可以让人们忽略你这不光彩的前科。在出格的男女私情和诚挚的爱情之间，一个正直却没有财产的男人会毫不犹豫地做出选择：他宁愿选择美德带来的种种不幸，也不会去选择罪恶带来的后果。但是在外省，可以让年轻人爱上的女人还真少。在这么一个处处机关算尽的地方，富有的年轻姑娘到不了他的手，而贫穷的年轻姑娘又不允许他爱。正如外省人说的，这相当于让饥饿和干渴结婚。然而，这种修道士一般的孤独寂寞对于年轻人非常危险。","His work in the city library escaped attention, and he buried in his soul his thoughts of fame, fearing that they might injure him; but deeper than all lay buried within him the secret of his heart,—a passion which hollowed his cheeks and yellowed his brow.He loved his distant cousin, this very Mademoiselle Cormon whom the Chevalier de Valois and du Bousquier, his hidden rivals, were stalking.This love had had its origin in calculation.Mademoiselle Cormon was thought to be one of the richest persons in the town: the poor lad had therefore been led to love her by desires for material happiness, by the hope, long indulged, of gilding with comfort his mother’s last years, by eager longing for the ease of life so needful to men who live by thought; but this most innocent point of departure degraded his passion in his own eyes.Moreover, he feared the ridicule the world would cast upon the love of a young man of twenty-three for an old maid of forty.And yet his passion was real; whatever may seem false about such a love elsewhere, it can be realized as a fact in the provinces, where, manners and morals being without change or chance or movement or mystery, marriage becomes a necessity of life.No family will accept a young man of dissolute habits.However natural the liaison of a young man, like Athanase, with a handsome girl, like Suzanne, for instance, might seem in a capital, it alarms provincial parents, and destroys the hopes of marriage of a poor young man when possibly the fortune of a rich one might cause such an unfortunate antecedent to be overlooked.Between the depravity of certain liaisons and a sincere love, a man of honor and no fortune will not hesitate: he prefers the misfortunes of virtue to the evils of vice.But in the provinces women with whom a young man call fall in love are rare.A rich young girl he cannot obtain in a region where all is calculation; a poor young girl he is prevented from loving; it would be, as provincials say, marrying hunger and thirst.Such monkish solitude is, however, dangerous to youth."
"以上这些思考可以解释为什么外省的生活如此牢固地以婚姻为基础。因此，我们发现，思维活跃而热情的天才人物不得不因其贫寒而自立，最后都要离开这个冷酷的地区。在这里，人们残酷而冷漠地摧残智慧，没有一位女子愿意爱上一位有才能的人、一位艺术家或一位科学家。","These reflections explain why provincial life is so firmly based on marriage.Thus we find that ardent and vigorous genius, forced to rely on the independence of its own poverty, quits these cold regions where thought is persecuted by brutal indifference, where no woman is willing to be a sister of charity to a man of talent, of art, of science."
"谁能理解阿塔纳斯·格朗松对科尔蒙小姐的一片痴情呢？那些男性富豪当然不能——那些社会上的苏丹，可以拥有大量的妻妾——中产阶层的男人也不能，他们是追寻前人已踏平的偏见之路求偶；那种根本不愿意去理解艺术家激情的女人们更不能，她们会把她们的美德加在男人们的才能上，认为男女两性都受着同样法则的约束。","Who will really understand Athanase Granson’s love for Mademoiselle Cormon?Certainly neither rich men—those sultans of society who fill their harems—nor middle-class men, who follow the well-beaten high-road of prejudices; nor women who, not choosing to understand the passions of artists, impose the yoke of their virtues upon men of genius, imagining that the two sexes are governed by the same laws."
"说到这儿，也许只有这些人才能说明问题：那些身心正在发展却必须压抑他们感情萌动的年轻人，那些由于贫困造成的才能受限而忧郁的艺术家，那些从一开始就受尽折磨、无依无靠、没有朋友，但是最终战胜了精神和身体双重痛苦的天才人物们。这些人会理解此刻正吞噬着阿塔纳斯的癌症般的阵阵刺痛，因为他们已经经历过这种有着宏伟目标却苦苦找不到任何手段去达成的长期的痛苦，这种天才的种子因落在贫瘠的土壤而秘密夭折的痛苦。这些人知道欲望的大小和想象的广阔性成正比。他们的欲望升得越高，摔得也越重。而这么一摔，关节怎么能不断呢？他们犀利的目光（阿塔纳斯也一样）已经预见了在等着他们的光辉前程，他们以为只有一层纱的距离就可以到达，但他们眼中这层纱的距离却因为社会而变成了一堵钢铁墙。受到使命感和艺术感的推动，他们一次次努力靠情感生活，而社会却不断在物质化。唉！外省人从物质上的舒适出发来计算和安排婚姻，而可怜的艺术家或是科学家就被禁止让婚姻具有双重用途——既让他衣食无忧，又让他的才能得到拯救。","Here, perhaps, we should appeal to those young men who suffer from the repression of their first desires at the moment when all their forces are developing; to artists sick of their own genius smothering under the pressure of poverty; to men of talent, persecuted and without influence, often without friends at the start, who have ended by triumphing over that double anguish, equally agonizing, of soul and body.Such men will well understand the lancinating pains of the cancer which was now consuming Athanase; they have gone through those long and bitter deliberations made in presence of some grandiose purpose they had not the means to carry out; they have endured those secret miscarriages in which the fructifying seed of genius falls on arid soil.Such men know that the grandeur of desires is in proportion to the height and breadth of the imagination.The higher they spring, the lower they fall; and how can it be that ties and bonds should not be broken by such a fall?Their piercing eye has seen—as did Athanase—the brilliant future which awaited them, and from which they fancied that only a thin gauze parted them; but that gauze through which their eyes could see is changed by Society into a wall of iron.Impelled by a vocation, by a sentiment of art, they endeavor again and again to live by sentiments which society as incessantly materializes.Alas! the provinces calculate and arrange marriage with the one view of material comfort, and a poor artist or man of science is forbidden to double its purpose and make it the saviour of his genius by securing to him the means of subsistence!"
"受到这些想法的影响，阿塔纳斯最初把娶科尔蒙小姐当成能给他带来永久生计的一种手段。之后，他可以成为有名望的人，让他的母亲幸福，同时他知道自己能够忠贞不渝地爱科尔蒙小姐。但是不久，他就在不知不觉中萌发出了真正的感情。他开始研究那老姑娘，成为习惯后，久而久之他就只能看见科尔蒙小姐的优点，完全无视她的缺点了。","Moved by such ideas, Athanase Granson first thought of marriage with Mademoiselle Cormon as a means of obtaining a livelihood which would be permanent.Thence he could rise to fame, and make his mother happy, knowing at the same time that he was capable of faithfully loving his wife.But soon his own will created, although he did not know it, a genuine passion.He began to study the old maid, and, by dint of the charm which habit gives, he ended by seeing only her beauties and ignoring her defects."
"二十三岁的青年男子的感觉在爱情中占有很大分量，欲火会在男人和女人间形成一种有色眼镜。从这方面来说，舞台上薛侣班抓住马尔斯琳的那一抱，真是博马舍的绝妙一笔。但是，当我们回想到贫穷让可怜的阿塔纳斯饱受孤独的煎熬，科尔蒙小姐是他关注的唯一女性，她总是不断地吸引着他的目光，他所有的视线全部集中在科尔蒙小姐的身上，那我们可以认为他的这份爱情是很自然的吧。","In a young man of twenty-three the senses count for much in love; their fire produces a sort of prism between his eyes and the woman.From this point of view the clasp with which Beaumarchis’ Cherubin seizes Marceline is a stroke of genius.But when we reflect that in the utter isolation to which poverty condemned poor Athanase, Mademoiselle Cormon was the only figure presented to his gaze, that she attracted his eye incessantly, that all the light he had was concentrated on her, surely his love may be considered natural."
"这份小心隐藏在内心的感情与日俱增。年轻人内心泛起的爱情之湖通过每小时注入一滴水而不断扩大，同时欲望、痛苦、希望和思念也在这平和而寂静的湖水中增长。通过感官的想象画出的内圆在不断加大，科尔蒙小姐在他的内心变得越来越庄严，而阿塔纳斯自己则越来越胆怯。","This sentiment, so carefully hidden, increased from day to day.Desires, sufferings, hopes, and meditations swelled in quietness and silence the lake widening ever in the young man’s breast, as hour by hour added its drop of water to the volume.And the wider this inward circle, drawn by the imagination, aided by the senses, grew, the more imposing Mademoiselle Cormon appeared to Athanase, and the more his own timidity increased."
"做母亲的早就猜透了他的心思。和外省的所有母亲一样，她心里早就算计好了这桩婚姻能带来什么好处。她心想，能找到这么一个富有才能，并且总是能光耀门楣、荣耀邻里的二十三岁年轻小伙子当丈夫，科尔蒙小姐该是多幸运呀。但是，阿塔纳斯没有什么财产，再加上科尔蒙小姐的年纪，在她看来都是这桩婚姻中不可逾越的障碍。她对此无计可施，只有耐心等待时机再设法克服了。像迪布斯基耶和德瓦卢瓦骑士一样，她有她的策略，怀着母爱的精明等待良机的到来。格朗松太太对骑士毫无戒备，但是她估计迪布斯基耶即使被拒绝了，肯定还不死心。于是她成了老商人强有力的秘密对手，为了她的儿子经常暗中陷害老商人，但是她从未向儿子透露她的所作所为。","The mother had divined the truth.Like all provincial mothers, she calculated candidly in her own mind the advantages of the match.She told herself that Mademoiselle Cormon would be very lucky to secure a husband in a young man of twenty-three, full of talent, who would always be an honor to his family and the neighborhood; at the same time the obstacles which her son’s want of fortune and Mademoiselle Cormon’s age presented to the marriage seemed to her almost insurmountable; she could think of nothing but patience as being able to vanquish them.Like du Bousquier, like the Chevalier de Valois, she had a policy of her own; she was on the watch for circumstances, awaiting the propitious moment for a move with the shrewdness of maternal instinct.Madame Granson had no fears at all as to the chevalier, but she did suppose that du Bousquier, although refused, retained certain hopes.As an able and underhand enemy to the latter, she did him much secret harm in the interests of her son; from whom, by the bye, she carefully concealed all such proceedings."
"解释到这里，我们就能明白苏珊的谎言一旦告诉格朗松太太，那意义将是多么重大。在这个担任妇女协会司库的慈善老太太手里，这会是多么有力的武器呀！在她为贞洁的苏珊募捐的时候，她会怎样慈祥而故作端庄地去渲染这条新闻呀！","After this explanation it is easy to understand the importance which Suzanne’s lie, confided to Madame Granson, was about to acquire.What a weapon put into the hands of this charitable lady, the treasurer of the Maternity Society!How she would gently and demurely spread the news while collecting assistance for the chaste Suzanne!"
"此刻，阿塔纳斯若有所思地双肘支着桌子，拿着勺子在空杯里转来转去，心不在焉地凝视着这间简陋的饭厅。红色的地板，摆着草垫的椅子，上漆的木厨，像是棋盘一样的粉白两色的格子布窗帘，挂在与厨房相通的一扇玻璃门上。阿塔纳斯背对壁炉坐在他母亲的对面，而壁炉在门的对面，窗户的强光照亮了他苍白的脸，镶在美丽的黑发当中，他那混着失望和清晨思绪的双眸炯炯有神。这一幕都骤然展现在苏珊的眼前。这个女工所在的社会阶层天生就对贫困和心灵上的痛苦很敏感，看着这样一幕，她突然有种触电的感觉，天晓得是为什么。也很难解释为什么男女之间会有触电的感觉，虽然有些很有头脑的人否认这种感觉的存在。这是瞬间照亮前程黑暗的一束光，是对相爱的神圣喜悦的一种预感，是相互理解的一种信念。总之，这就像是一位钢琴大师稳健而灵巧的手落在感官的键盘上。双眼被这不可抗拒的一幕吸引住了，心弦被拨动了，幸福的旋律在心中和耳中激荡，一个声音在喊道：“就是他了！”通常思考会给这份澎湃的激情泼上一盆冷水，于是一切就会烟消云散。","At the present moment Athanase, leaning pensively on his elbow at the breakfast table, was twirling his spoon in his empty cup and contemplating with a preoccupied eye the poor room with its red brick floor, its straw chairs, its painted wooden buffet, its pink and white curtains chequered like a backgammon board, which communicated with the kitchen through a glass door.As his back was to the chimney which his mother faced, and as the chimney was opposite to the door, his pallid face, strongly lighted from the window, framed in beautiful black hair, the eyes gleaming with despair and fiery with morning thoughts, was the first object which met the eyes of the incoming Suzanne.The grisette, who belonged to a class which certainly has the instinct of misery and the sufferings of the heart, suddenly felt that electric spark, darting from Heaven knows where, which can never be explained, which some strong minds deny, but the sympathetic stroke of which has been felt by many men and many women.It is at once a light which lightens the darkness of the future, a presentiment of the sacred joys of a shared love, the certainty of mutual comprehension.Above all, it is like the touch of a firm and able hand on the keyboard of the senses.The eyes are fascinated by an irresistible attraction; the heart is stirred; the melodies of happiness echo in the soul and in the ears; a voice cries out, “It is he!”Often reflection casts a douche of cold water on this boiling emotion, and all is over."
"在这有如闪电般飞快的一瞬间，苏珊的内心被这种感情占满了。真爱的火焰烧毁了在放荡和堕落的生活中培育出的邪恶的野草。她意识到了自己如此弄虚作假玷污自己的名誉，是多么不光彩和不值得。前一天在她眼里无非是开了个玩笑的事，现在在她看来成了对她严厉的指控。在她自己的成功面前，她退缩了。但他们是不可能有什么结果的。阿塔纳斯那么穷，苏珊只能抱着一丝渺茫的希望，希望自己能在巴黎发财致富，满载而归，然后对他说：“我爱你！我有钱可以让我们一起幸福地生活了。”或者就像你也许会经历的一样，命运会在下一刻将这场喜雨化为乌有。","In a moment, as rapid as the flash of the lightning, Suzanne received the broadside of this emotion in her heart.The flame of a real love burned up the evil weeds fostered by a libertine and dissipated life.She saw how much she was losing of decency and value by accusing herself falsely.What had seemed to her a joke the night before became to her eyes a serious charge against herself.She recoiled at her own success.But the impossibility of any result; the poverty of the young man; a vague hope of enriching herself, of going to Paris, and returning with full hands to say, “I love you! here are the means of happiness!”Or mere fate, if you will have it so, dried up the next moment this beneficent dew."
"这位野心勃勃的女工怯生生地要求和格朗松太太交谈片刻，于是格朗松太太立刻带她进了卧室。苏珊出来时，又看了看阿塔纳斯，他仍然保持着原有的姿势，苏珊的泪水忍不住涌了上来。至于格朗松太太，她则是喜出望外。她终于有了一件可以对付迪布斯基耶的武器了，而且是很可怕的武器，现在她可以给他致命一击了。自然她答应那个被引诱的可怜姑娘，会让所有的慈善妇女，尤其是妇女协会的成员给她支援。她打算之后每天用整日的时间进行十几次登门拜访，要给那有罪的老光棍造成可怕的风暴。德瓦卢瓦骑士虽然预见了这绯闻会带来的后果，但绝对想不到他这一所作所为会酿成怎样的丑闻。","The ambitious grisette asked with a timid air for a moment’s interview with Madame Granson, who took her at once into her bedchamber.When Suzanne came out she looked again at Athanase; he was still in the same position, and the tears came into her eyes.As for Madame Granson, she was radiant with joy.At last she had a weapon, and a terrible one, against du Bousquier; she could now deal him a mortal blow.She had of course promised the poor seduced girl the support of all charitable ladies and that of the members of the Maternity Society in particular; she foresaw a dozen visits which would occupy her whole day, and brew up a frightful storm on the head of the guilty du Bousquier.The Chevalier de Valois, while foreseeing the turn the affair would take, had really no idea of the scandal which would result from his own action."
"“我亲爱的孩子，”格朗松太太对她儿子说道，“你知道，我们要去科尔蒙小姐家赴宴。花点心思打扮一下自己吧。你这样马马虎虎地穿衣服可不行。穿上你那件带花边的漂亮衬衣和那件埃尔伯夫绿呢子礼服。你听我的准没错，”她精明地加上一句，“而且，科尔蒙小姐就要去普雷博戴了，肯定会有很多人去向她道别。如果一个小伙子想要结婚，他就要想方设法让自己讨人喜欢。如果女孩子会说实话，天哪！我的孩子，你要是知道什么让她们着迷，你肯定会大吃一惊的。通常只要一个男子骑着马率领一个炮兵连从她们面前走过，或是穿着紧身的礼服出席舞会，就足以迷住女孩子了。有时只要一个扭头，一种忧郁的姿态，就能让女孩们去想象这个男人的一生；她们会设想出适合这个主人公的罗曼史，虽然这个人通常是个傻瓜而已，但是一桩婚事就这么成了。你要注意观察德瓦卢瓦骑士，好好学学他，模仿他的举止，看看他是怎么轻松自然地抛头露面的，他从不会像你这样拘谨。你要开口讲讲话，不然别人会认为你什么都不懂。其实你能把希伯来文《圣经》倒背如流呢！”","“My dear child,” said Madame Granson to her son, “we are to dine, you know, with Mademoiselle Cormon; do take a little pains with your appearance.You are wrong to neglect your dress as you do.Put on that handsome frilled shirt and your green coat of Elbeuf cloth.I have my reasons,” she added slyly.“Besides, Mademoiselle Cormon is going to Prebaudet, and many persons will doubtless call to bid her good-bye.When a young man is marriageable he ought to take every means to make himself agreeable.If girls would only tell the truth, heavens! my dear boy, you’d be astonished at what makes them fall in love.Often it suffices for a man to ride past them at the head of a company of artillery, or show himself at a ball in tight clothes.Sometimes a mere turn of the head, a melancholy attitude, makes them suppose a man’s whole life; they’ll invent a romance to match the hero—who is often a mere brute, but the marriage is made.Watch the Chevalier de Valois: study him; copy his manners; see with what ease he presents himself; he never puts on a stiff air, as you do.Talk a little more; one would really think you didn’t know anything,—you, who know Hebrew by heart.”"
"阿塔纳斯听了他妈妈的这番话后惊讶不已，但是表现得很顺从。然后他起身，拿上帽子去市长办公室，心里还一边琢磨着：“难道妈妈猜透了我心里的秘密？”","Athanase listened to his mother with a surprised but submissive air; then he rose, took his cap, and went off to the mayor’s office, saying to himself, “Can my mother suspect my secret?”"
"他经过科尔蒙小姐住的瓦诺布勒街，这是他每天早上给自己安排的小小的乐趣，像往常一样他一边走着，一边幻想着种种异想天开的事情。","He passed through the rue du Val-Noble, where Mademoiselle Cormon lived,—a little pleasure which he gave himself every morning, thinking, as usual, a variety of fanciful things:—"
"“她肯定想不到经过她门前的这个小伙子有多么爱她，会对她忠贞不渝，永远不会让她伤心，也决不会介入她对自己财产的自由支配。老天！这真是命中注定的不幸呀！在这同一座城市，两个处在我们相似情况的人，虽然近在咫尺，却没有任何办法可以让他们相结合。假如今晚我和她说话会怎么样呢？”","“How little she knows that a young man is passing before her house who loves her well, who would be faithful to her, who would never cause her any grief; who would leave her the entire management of her fortune without interference.Good God! what fatality!Here, side by side, in the same town, are two persons in our mutual condition, and yet nothing can bring them together.Suppose I were to speak to her this evening?”"
"与此同时，苏珊一边想着阿塔纳斯，一边已经回到了她母亲家。就像许多女人渴望付出超人的力量来帮助她们喜欢的男人那样，苏珊也觉得她完全可以用她的身体当作垫脚石，帮助阿塔纳斯摘到自己的王冠。","During this time Suzanne had returned to her mother’s house thinking of Athanase; and, like many other women who have longed to help an adored man beyond the limit of human powers, she felt herself capable of making her body a stepping-stone on which he could rise to attain his throne."
"现在有必要走进这位集众多利益于一身的老姑娘的家门了，故事中所有的演员，除了苏珊之外，都将在今晚会面。至于苏珊这位俊俏而胆大的小姑娘，敢于在生活伊始像亚历山大大帝那样破釜沉舟，以一桩捏造的事实来掀起这场搏斗。她把这激烈的利害关系引入舞台后就销声匿迹了。她实现了她最大的愿望。几天之后，苏珊就带着钱和漂亮的衣服离开了她的家乡。在她的行李里，有一件绿色棱纹平布的连衣裙和一顶漂亮的有着粉色条纹的绿色帽子。这是德瓦卢瓦骑士给她的礼物，对于她来说是最宝贵的东西，甚至比钱还重要。如果骑士等她走红后再去巴黎，她肯定还是会为了骑士放弃一切。像《圣经》里长者们没有看清的圣洁的苏珊一样，我们这个苏珊兴高采烈地为自己赢得了在巴黎发展的希望。而同时，所有的阿郎松人正在痛惜感慨她的不幸，慈善协会和妇女协会两大协会的女士们都对她的不幸表示了极大的同情。一位学识渊博的医生认为，漂亮的诺曼底姑娘在极具魔力的巴黎堕落女性中占三分之一。虽然苏珊具有那三分之一女性的形象，要知道她始终处在社交圈较为体面的上层。正如德瓦卢瓦骑士所说，在女性不复存在的这个时代，苏珊就是迪瓦诺布勒夫人。而在其他时代，她可能会与过去的罗多珀、安帕丽亚、尼侬之类的人并驾齐驱。复辟时期的某个最杰出的作家会把她置于自己的保护之下，可能还会娶她。他会是一位记者，由于他每一两年就发表新的政见而因此得以超越一切公众舆论。","It is now necessary to enter the house of this old maid toward whom so many interests are converging, where the actors in this scene, with the exception of Suzanne, were all to meet this very evening.As for Suzanne, that handsome individual bold enough to burn her ships like Alexander at her start in life, and to begin the battle by a falsehood, she disappears from the stage, having introduced upon it a violent element of interest.Her utmost wishes were gratified.She quitted her native town a few days later, well supplied with money and good clothes, among which was a fine dress of green reps and a charming green bonnet lined with pink, the gift of Monsieur de Valois,—a present which she preferred to all the rest, even the money.If the chevalier had gone to Paris in the days of her future brilliancy, she would certainly have left every one for him.Like the chaste Susannah of the Bible, whom the Elders hardly saw, she established herself joyously and full of hope in Paris, while all Alencon was deploring her misfortunes, for which the ladies of two Societies (Charity and Maternity) manifested the liveliest sympathy.Though Suzanne is a fair specimen of those handsome Norman women whom a learned physician reckons as comprising one third of her fallen class whom our monstrous Paris absorbs, it must be stated that she remained in the upper and more decent regions of gallantry.At an epoch when, as Monsieur de Valois said, Woman no longer existed, she was simply “Madame du Val-Noble”; in other days she would have rivalled the Rhodopes, the Imperias, the Ninons of the past.One of the most distinguished writers of the Restoration has taken her under his protection; perhaps he may marry her.He is a journalist, and consequently above public opinion, inasmuch as he manufactures it afresh every year or two."
"第四章 科尔蒙小姐","CHAPTER IV MADEMOISELLE CORMON"
"在法国几乎所有的二等城市里，都会有这样一个沙龙，作为那些有威望的要人进行集会的场所——尽管他们是当地的重要人物，却不是上流社会的精英。沙龙的男女主人自然是这个城镇的权威人士，无论他们高兴到哪里，都会在那里受到隆重的接待。城里举办正式晚宴或是社交宴会，他们都必定会受到邀请出席。但是那些拥有城堡的人，那些拥有上好土地的显要家庭，简而言之，就是省里的贵族，是不会去他们家的。他们之间的社交活动是通过发张请帖，接受宴请并再回请，如此礼尚往来的。","In nearly all the second-class prefectures of France there exists one salon which is the meeting-ground of those considerable and well-considered persons of the community who are, nevertheless, NOT the cream of the best society.The master and mistress of such an establishment are counted among the leading persons of the town; they are received wherever it may please them to visit; no fete is given, no formal or diplomatic dinner takes place, to which they are not invited.But the chateau people, heads of families possessing great estates, in short, the highest personages in the department, do not go to their houses; social intercourse between them is carried on by cards from one to the other, and a dinner or soiree accepted and returned."
"小贵族、教会人士和地方行政官员都会参加这类沙龙，因此这个沙龙影响很大。当地的智囊就聚集在这个固定的不讲排场的圈子里。在这里，大家彼此都知根知底，完全对奢侈和衣着漠不关心。若想将觊觎多年的十英亩或十二英亩草地弄到手，很可能需要无穷无尽的外交活动才行。相比之下，他们认为在意奢侈和衣着是很幼稚的行为。这个社交圈子坚持它的先入之见，不管好坏，都不会瞻前顾后。不经过长时间的审视，他们绝不会接受任何来自巴黎的事物。他们拒绝穿开司米，也拒绝在国家债权人名册上登记。他们嘲笑时尚和新事物，不读书，情愿对科学、文学或是工业发明一无所知。若是觉得哪个官员不够好，他们就会坚持撤掉他的职务；如果那个官员拒绝被撤掉，他们就会像蜜蜂对待闯入他们蜂巢的蜗牛一样，用蜡将他裹住，把他孤立起来。","This salon, in which the lesser nobility, the clergy, and the magistracy meet together, exerts a great influence.The judgment and mind of the region reside in that solid, unostentatious society, where each man knows the resources of his neighbor, where complete indifference is shown to luxury and dress,—pleasures which are thought childish in comparison to that of obtaining ten or twelve acres of pasture land,—a purchase coveted for years, which has probably given rise to endless diplomatic combinations.Immovable in its prejudices, good or evil, this social circle follows a beaten track, looking neither before it nor behind it.It accepts nothing from Paris without long examination and trial; it rejects cashmeres as it does investments on the Grand-Livre; it scoffs at fashions and novelties; reads nothing, prefers ignorance, whether of science, literature, or industrial inventions.It insists on the removal of a prefect when that official does not suit it; and if the administration resists, it isolates him, after the manner of bees who wall up a snail in wax when it gets into their hive."
"在这样的社会，闲言碎语总是能成为严肃的判决。在这里很少见到年轻女士。她们来这里是为了寻求对她们行为的赞同——对她们重要作用的认可。这样一家独霸的无上权威会让当地的其他几户人家自尊心受伤，而他们则通过估计那一户人家举办聚会的开销以及他们能从聚会得到的盈利来自我安慰。如果当地真的没有这么富有的人来专门设宴，当地的大人物则会选择一个无害的小人物家作为聚会场所，就跟在阿郎松的做法一样。这个小人物一般生活稳定，性格和地位不会引起任何人的不快。","In this society gossip is often turned into solemn verdicts.Young women are seldom seen there; when they come it is to seek approbation of their conduct,—a consecration of their self-importance.This supremacy granted to one house is apt to wound the sensibilities of other natives of the region, who console themselves by adding up the cost it involves, and by which they profit.If it so happens that there is no fortune large enough to keep open house in this way, the big-wigs of the place choose a place of meeting, as they did at Alencon, in the house of some inoffensive person, whose settled life and character and position offers no umbrage to the vanities or the interests of any one."
"这些年来，阿郎松的上流社会都以这种方式在一位老姑娘家聚会。而这位老姑娘还不知道她的财产已为她的表姐格朗松太太和两个老光棍所觊觎。他们的暗中指望，我们刚才已揭示清楚了。","For some years the upper classes of Alencon had met in this way at the house of an old maid, whose fortune was, unknown to herself, the aim and object of Madame Granson, her second cousin, and of the two old bachelors whose secret hopes in that direction we have just unveiled."
"这位老姑娘与她的舅舅一起生活。她舅舅曾经是赛镇主教区的主教，也做过她的监护人，并且他的遗产将由她来继承。罗丝—玛丽—维克图瓦·科尔蒙是其家族现今的代表，这个家族在早些时期是外省最负盛名的家族之一。虽然这个家族属于中产阶级，她却常与贵族阶级有来往，并与他们交好。过去，她的家族出过好几位阿郎松公爵的总管，出过好些穿长袍的法官，还有几位主教。科尔蒙小姐的外祖父德斯蓬德先生曾由贵族选入议会，而她的父亲科尔蒙先生也被第三等级选入了议会，但这两个人都没有接受任命。过去一百多年来，这家的女儿纷纷嫁给外省的贵族。因此，这个家族在公爵领地上有颇多的吸根，几乎在所有的家谱上都有份。还没有哪户中产阶级家族能像这个家族这般与贵族相似了。","This lady lived with her maternal uncle, a former grand-vicar of the bishopric of Seez, once her guardian, and whose heir she was.The family of which Rose-Marie-Victoire Cormon was the present representative had been in earlier days among the most considerable in the province.Though belonging to the middle classes, she consorted with the nobility, among whom she was more or less allied, her family having furnished, in past years, stewards to the Duc d’Alencon, many magistrates to the long robe, and various bishops to the clergy.Monsieur de Sponde, the maternal grandfather of Mademoiselle Cormon, was elected by the Nobility to the States-General, and Monsieur Cormon, her father, by the Tiers-Etat, though neither accepted the mission.For the last hundred years the daughters of the family had married nobles belonging to the provinces; consequently, this family had thrown out so many suckers throughout the duchy as to appear on nearly all the genealogical trees.No bourgeois family had ever seemed so like nobility."
"科尔蒙小姐居住的房屋，是在亨利四世统治下，由最后一代阿郎松公爵的主管皮埃尔·科尔蒙建造的，此后一直属于这个家族。在科尔蒙小姐的全部可见财产中，这座房子尤其令那两个老情人垂涎三尺。不过这幢房屋不但不能盈利，反倒要花费不少钱。但是要在外省再找到这么一所房屋实在是很难了。它地处市中心，环境优美，外表构造漂亮，内部结构实用，包括科尔蒙小姐的爱慕者在内的所有阿郎松人都对此艳羡不已。","The house in which Mademoiselle Cormon lived, build in Henri IV’s time, by Pierre Cormon, the steward of the last Duc d’Alencon, had always belonged to the family; and among the old maid’s visible possessions this one was particularly stimulating to the covetous desires of the two old lovers.Yet, far from producing revenue, the house was a cause of expense.But it is so rare to find in the very centre of a provincial town a private dwelling without unpleasant surroundings, handsome in outward structure and convenient within, that Alencon shared the envy of the lovers."
"这所古老的公馆恰恰坐落在瓦诺布勒街的中间位置。它以经久耐用的结构而著称，这是由玛丽·德梅迪契引入的一种建筑风格。虽然是用难以加工的大理石建成的，但是这房屋的屋角、窗框和门框都由凿成钻石面形状的三角木来装饰。房屋是两层楼的结构，屋顶很高，上面有几扇突出的窗户。窗顶上有雕刻的三角楣，镶在非常漂亮的橡木窗框之内，外面还有栏杆加以装饰。每两扇窗户之间伸出一个滴水嘴，形状是一个没有身体的动物的嘴，把雨水吐在凿了五个洞眼的大石头上。两面山墙顶上是铅铸的花束，这代表着中产阶级，以前只有贵族才能有权利安装风向标。庭院的右边是车库和马房，左边是厨房、柴房和洗衣房。","This old mansion stands exactly in the middle of the rue du Val-Noble.It is remarkable for the strength of its construction,—a style of building introduced by Marie de’ Medici.Though built of granite,—a stone which is hard to work,—its angles, and the casings of the doors and windows, are decorated with corner blocks cut into diamond facets.It has only one clear story above the ground-floor; but the roof, rising steeply, has several projecting windows, with carved spandrels rather elegantly enclosed in oaken frames, and externally adorned with balustrades.Between each of these windows is a gargoyle presenting the fantastic jaws of an animal without a body, vomiting the rain-water upon large stones pierced with five holes.The two gables are surmounted by leaden bouquets,—a symbol of the bourgeoisie; for nobles alone had the privilege in former days of having weather-vanes.To right of the courtyard are the stables and coach-house; to left, the kitchen, wood-house, and laundry."
"供马车出入的前廊一扇大门总是开着的，让街上的路人可以一眼看见宽敞的庭院当中的大花坛，四周围着女贞树树篱来固定堆起的土。大花坛内由一些四季蔷薇、丁香、轮锋菊、百合和西班牙染料木组成，夏季四周还要摆上大盆栽的月桂、石榴和爱神木。看到这个庭院及其附属格局干净得细致入微，任何一位陌生人立刻就能猜到这家有一位老姑娘。统管这一切的目光应该是无所事事、非常仔细地四处审查的目光，会这么做的人并非出于性格如此，而是需要找事干。只有这样一位终日无所事事需要想办法打发时间的老小姐，才会叫人拔去地面石板缝中间的杂草，叫人把墙顶擦洗干净，不停地打扫总是关着马车房的皮门帘。只有她闲着没事才能将荷兰式的清洁引进这小小的外省地方。在这个位于佩尔舍、布列塔尼和诺曼底之间的地方，人们总是自豪地宣称他们对舒适满不在乎。","One side of the porte-cochere, being left open, allowed the passers in the street to see in the midst of the vast courtyard a flower-bed, the raised earth of which was held in place by a low privet hedge.A few monthly roses, pinkes, lilies, and Spanish broom filled this bed, around which in the summer season boxes of paurestinus, pomegranates, and myrtle were placed.Struck by the scrupulous cleanliness of the courtyard and its dependencies, a stranger would at once have divined that the place belonged to an old maid.The eye which presided there must have been an unoccupied, ferreting eye; minutely careful, less from nature than for want of something to do.An old maid, forced to employ her vacant days, could alone see to the grass being hoed from between the paving stones, the tops of the walls kept clean, the broom continually going, and the leather curtains of the coach-house always closed.She alone would have introduced, out of busy idleness, a sort of Dutch cleanliness into a house on the confines of Bretagne and Normandie,—a region where they take pride in professing an utter indifference to comfort."
"德瓦卢瓦骑士和迪布斯基耶每次登上这家公馆台阶高处两侧的石阶时都会对自己说，这公馆很适合贵族议员，或者本市市长应该住在这里。","Never did the Chevalier de Valois, or du Bousquier, mount the steps of the double stairway leading to the portico of this house without saying to himself, one, that it was fit for a peer of France, the other, that the mayor of the town ought to live there."
"通过一扇落地窗由门廊进入前厅，地上铺着红砖，还有护墙板。护墙板成了家族肖像的医院：有几个人只有一只眼，另外几个人肩膀脱臼，一个人拿着帽子，但手却没了，另一个人给及膝截去了一条腿。客人的外套、木鞋、套鞋、雨伞、帽子和皮大衣都放在这里。这是个储物间，每个客人来的时候都在这里放下随身衣物、离开的时候再带走。沿着每一面墙都有一张长凳，让提着风灯来接主人回家的仆人休息。还有一个大火炉，用来抵御来自花园和庭院贯穿门厅的寒风。","A glass door gave entrance from this portico into an antechamber, a species of gallery paved in red tiles and wainscoted, which served as a hospital for the family portraits,—some having an eye put out, others suffering from a dislocated shoulder; this one held his hat in a hand that no longer existed; that one was a case of amputation at the knee.Here were deposited the cloaks, clogs, overshoes, umbrellas, hoods, and pelisses of the guests.It was an arsenal where each arrival left his baggage on arriving, and took it up when departing.Along each wall was a bench for the servants who arrived with lanterns, and a large stove, to counteract the north wind, which blew through this hall from the garden to the courtyard."
"这房屋分成了均等的两部分。朝院子的一边是楼梯间，对着花园是很大的饭厅，还有一间连着厨房的配膳室。另一边是一间有着四扇窗户的客厅，紧挨客厅还有两个小间——一间朝着花园，是闺房；另一间朝着院子，是书房。","The house was divided in two equal parts.On one side, toward the courtyard, was the well of the staircase, a large dining-room looking to the garden, and an office or pantry which communicated with the kitchen.On the other side was the salon, with four windows, beyond which were two smaller rooms,—one looking on the garden, and used as a boudoir, the other lighted from the courtyard, and used as a sort of office."
"房子的第二层包括一套完整的家庭套房，还有德斯蓬德老神父居住的几间屋子。阁楼上是大大小小老鼠的营房，科尔蒙小姐多次向德瓦卢瓦骑士抱怨过，说她使用了各种办法，都没能赶走这些老鼠。花园大概有半亩大小，亮河就从花园边缘流过。因为河床里有云母片闪闪发光，所以称之为亮河。亮河在别处都闪闪发光，唯独在瓦诺布勒不然，因为在那浅浅的河水里满载城里工厂往河里排放的燃料和残渣。科尔蒙小姐的花园对面挤满了做各种生意的人家。令她高兴的是，他们都是些安静的人，包括一个面包师，一个清洁工，一个家具商，还有几个中产阶级的人。花园里都是些常见的花，尽头是一处天然的平台，像是个码头，下几个台阶就可到亮河边。你可以想像，在这台阶的宽檐栏杆上，摆着几盆高高的蓝色和白色的大瓷盆，盆内栽着丁香花。沿着附近左右的墙壁，种着两行菩提树，修剪得很整齐。大家可以想象出这幅景象，环绕在科尔蒙家族颇有气派的房屋周围的是平凡却又简洁安静、谦逊而令人愉悦的景色。多么清幽，多么宁静呀！没有任何娇揉造作的东西，没有任何转瞬即逝的事物，这里的一切似乎都是永恒的！","The upper floor contained a complete apartment for a family household, and a suite of rooms where the venerable Abbe de Sponde had his abode.The garrets offered fine quarters to the rats and mice, whose nocturnal performances were related by Mademoiselle Cormon to the Chevalier de Valois, with many expressions of surprise at the inutility of her efforts to get rid of them.The garden, about half an acre in size, is margined by the Brillante, so named from the particles of mica which sparkle in its bed elsewhere than in the Val—Noble, where its shallow waters are stained by the dyehouses, and loaded with refuse from the other industries of the town.The shore opposite to Mademoiselle Cormon’s garden is crowded with houses where a variety of trades are carried on; happily for her, the occupants are quiet people,—a baker, a cleaner, an upholsterer, and several bourgeois.The garden, full of common flowers, ends in a natural terrace, forming a quay, down which are several steps leading to the river.Imagine on the balustrade of this terrace a number of tall vases of blue and white pottery, in which are gilliflowers; and to right and left, along the neighboring walls, hedges of linden closely trimmed in, and you will gain an idea of the landscape, full of tranquil chastity, modest cheerfulness, but commonplace withal, which surrounded the venerable edifice of the Cormon family.What peace! what tranquillity!Nothing pretentious, but nothing transitory; all seems eternal there!"
"这房子的一楼都是接待客人用的。房子里散发出古老的、一成不变的外省气息。偌大的正方形客厅有四扇窗户，都镶着漆成灰色的木框。在壁炉上放着唯一的一面椭圆形的穿衣镜。镜框上画的是时序女神带领着日神前进，是一种单色画。在这一带，这种绘画风格非常普及，尤其是在每一处门楣上。在那里，艺术家们呈现了永恒的季节女神的形象，使得法国中部的大部分人家都憎恨那个忙着到处游荡、捡捡稻穗、转着圈或是给这个那个戴花环的令人讨厌的爱神丘比特了。每扇窗户都挂着绿色锦缎窗帘，窗帘绳上带着很大的流苏结，将窗帘吊起，像是一个偌大的华盖。上了油漆和彩釉的木制家具都是上世纪流行的弯曲的形状，上面都盖着织锦。椅背上露出的装饰图画是拉方丹的寓言故事，有的地方被修补过。天花板被一条大梁分成两半，正中挂着一盏由大块纯石英晶体做成的古老的支形吊灯，上面罩着绿色灯罩。在壁炉上放着两个塞夫勒蓝色的花瓶，镜框上有两个古老的烛台和一台挂钟。这台挂钟上的绘画主题取材于《逃兵》的最后一场，可见瑟丹纳的作品在当时多么流行。这个铜镀金挂钟的画上有十一个人物，每个人物大概四英寸高。画面的后部是逃兵，由士兵押着走出监狱，前景上是一位几乎昏倒在地的少妇指着手上国王的赦免令。客厅的墙上装饰着近年代的家族成员肖像，有一两张是里戈的作品，有三幅是拉图尔的色彩画。这间大屋子被四张牌桌、一张西洋双六棋棋盘、一张皮克牌牌桌给塞得满满的。而且，这也是唯一铺了天花板的房间。","The ground-floor is devoted wholly to the reception-rooms.The old, unchangeable provincial spirit pervades them.The great square salon has four windows, modestly cased in woodwork painted gray.A single oblong mirror is placed above the fireplace; the top of its frame represented the Dawn led by the Hours, and painted in camaieu (two shades of one color).This style of painting infested the decorative art of the day, especially above door-frames, where the artist displayed his eternal Seasons, and made you, in most houses in the centre of France, abhor the odious Cupids, endlessly employed in skating, gleaning, twirling, or garlanding one another with flowers.Each window was draped in green damask curtains, looped up by heavy cords, which made them resemble a vast dais.The furniture, covered with tapestry, the woodwork, painted and varnished, and remarkable for the twisted forms so much the fashion in the last century, bore scenes from the fables of La Fontaine on the chair-backs; some of this tapestry had been mended.The ceiling was divided at the centre of the room by a huge beam, from which depended an old chandelier of rock-crystal swathed in green gauze.On the fireplace were two vases in Sevres blue, and two old girandoles attached to the frame of the mirror, and a clock, the subject of which, taken from the last scene of the “Deserteur,” proved the enormous popularity of Sedaine’s work.This clock, of bronze-gilt, bore eleven personages upon it, each about four inches tall.At the back the Deserter was seen issuing from prison between the soldiers; in the foreground the young woman lay fainting, and pointing to his pardon.On the walls of this salon were several of the more recent portraits of the family,—one or two by Rigaud, and three pastels by Latour.Four card tables, a backgammon board, and a piquet table occupied the vast room, the only one in the house, by the bye, which was ceiled."
"饭厅地面铺着黑白两种石块，没有天花板，不过椽子都上了漆。厅里摆着漂亮的大理石面酒桌，这是按照外省对肠胃开战的要求。画着壁画的墙上呈现的是一个满是花朵的格架。椅子是由上了彩釉的藤条编织的，门是用天然的木材做成的。这屋子里里外外的所有东西都让人感觉到一种威严的气息。外省的天才保存了这一切，既没有新或旧，也没有年轻或老朽的事物。这里到处都让人感到冷冰冰的中规中矩。","The dining-room, paved in black and white stone, not ceiled, and its beams painted, was furnished with one of those enormous sideboards with marble tops, required by the war waged in the provinces against the human stomach.The walls, painted in fresco, represented a flowery trellis.The seats were of varnished cane, and the doors of natural wood.All things about the place carried out the patriarchal air which emanated from the inside as well as the outside of the house.The genius of the provinces preserved everything; nothing was new or old, neither young nor decrepit.A cold precision made itself felt throughout."
"诺曼底、布列塔尼、曼恩和安茹的游客大概在这些外省的省府都见过类似科尔蒙公馆的房屋。从式样上看，科尔蒙公馆是法国布尔乔亚房屋的原型，因此在这部作品中它有助于理解当地人的言谈举止、风俗和观念。谁会没有感觉到，在这老建筑里的生活一定是很平静而又规律得单调的呢？其中也有一间藏书室，正好位于亮河的水平面以下。书籍装订精美，摆放整齐。书上的灰尘不但没有损坏它们，反倒使书籍更显珍贵。科尔蒙公馆藏书的精心程度有如一些省份保存好酒的劲头。这些省份不种葡萄，因此葡萄酒都靠从外省运来，一般都是勃艮第、都兰、加斯科涅和南方榨机生产出来的香味醇厚的天然好酒。因为运费极高，所以人们只愿意买最好的酒。","Tourists in Normandy, Brittany, Maine, and Anjou must all have seen in the capitals of those provinces many houses which resemble more or less that of the Cormons; for it is, in its way, an archetype of the burgher houses in that region of France, and it deserves a place in this history because it serves to explain manners and customs, and represents ideas.Who does not already feel that life must have been calm and monotonously regular in this old edifice?It contained a library; but that was placed below the level of the river.The books were well bound and shelved, and the dust, far from injuring them, only made them valuable.They were preserved with the care given in these provinces deprived of vineyards to other native products, desirable for their antique perfume, and issued by the presses of Bourgogne, Touraine, Gascogne, and the South.The cost of transportation was too great to allow any but the best products to be imported."
"科尔蒙小姐主持的妇女协会的基本成员大致有一百五十人，有几个时不时地去乡下，偶尔有几个生病的，或是几个出门办事去了，但是总有一些忠于这个组织的人，除了到别处赴宴以外，每晚必到。此外，还有一些出于义务或习惯一定要留在城里的人。这些人都是成年人，其中只有很少的人出门旅行过，几乎所有的人都是一直呆在外省生活的，还有一些人曾参与过舒昂党其事。自从这些正义事业的英勇捍卫者受到褒奖以后，这些人都开始放心大胆地谈论这场战争了。德瓦卢瓦骑士就是这最后起义的主使者之一。就在这次武装斗争中，德蒙托郎侯爵被他的情妇出卖，丢了性命。当时著名的土行者也崭露头角，不过现在在马耶讷附近平静地从事牲口贸易。在这六个月来，德瓦卢瓦骑士已经道出了当年怎么设计捉弄一个叫于洛的共和党人。于洛是一七九八年到一八零零年之间驻守在阿郎松那个团的指挥官，他给当地人留下了不少回忆。（见《舒昂党人》）","The basis of Mademoiselle Cormon’s society consisted of about one hundred and fifty persons; some went at times to the country; others were occasionally ill; a few travelled about the department on business; but certain of the faithful came every night (unless invited elsewhere), and so did certain others compelled by duties or by habit to live permanently in the town.All the personages were of ripe age; few among them had ever travelled; nearly all had spent their lives in the provinces, and some had taken part in the chouannerie.The latter were beginning to speak fearlessly of that war, now that rewards were being showered on the defenders of the good cause.Monsieur de Valois, one of the movers in the last uprising (during which the Marquis de Montauran, betrayed by his mistress, perished in spite of the devotion of Marche-a-Terre, now tranquilly raising cattle for the market near Mayenne),—Monsieur de Valois had, during the last six months, given the key to several choice stratagems practised upon an old republican named Hulot, the commander of a demi-brigade stationed at Alencon from 1798 to 1800, who had left many memories in the place.(See “The Chouans.”)"
"这里的女人们不大讲究穿戴，只有每周三去科尔蒙小姐家聚餐除外。科尔蒙小姐每周三都要宴请宾客，上周三被邀请的人再次前来完成他们的“消化拜访”。周三是盛大的晚会，前来聚会的人数众多，宾客都打扮得十分入时。有些妇女会带自己的活计来，像是针线活、毛线活或是毛绒活。年轻姑娘也毫不害羞地做着自己的刺绣活，以便用来补贴日常花销。有些丈夫出于策略把妻子也带来，因为年轻男子很少来这里聚会。这里你凑着别人耳边说的任何悄悄话都会引起所有人的注意；因此，这里不存在任何危险，无论是少女还是少妇都不会听到任何谈情说爱的话语。","The women of this society took little pains with their dress, except on Wednesdays, when Mademoiselle Cormon gave a dinner, on which occasion the guests invited on the previous Wednesday paid their “visit of digestion.”Wednesdays were gala days: the assembly was numerous; guests and visitors appeared in fiocchi; some women brought their sewing, knitting, or worsted work; the young girls were not ashamed to make patterns for the Alencon point lace, with the proceeds of which they paid for their personal expenses.Certain husbands brought their wives out of policy, for young men were few in that house; not a word could be whispered in any ear without attracting the attention of all; there was therefore no danger, either for young girls or wives, of love-making."
"每晚六点钟，常客便将长长的前厅占满。每位来客都带着手杖、外套和灯笼，陆续前来。这些人彼此都很了解，他们的习惯和做事方式都是一成不变的，以至于如果偶尔遇到德斯蓬德老神父在休息，科尔蒙小姐还在自己卧室里的情况，不论是贴身女仆若赛特，还是男仆雅克兰，还是厨师玛丽特都不用去通知他们。第一个到的人等着第二个人到，然后如果来的人数目够玩皮克牌、惠斯特或波士顿了，他们不用等德斯蓬德神父或是科尔蒙小姐来，就开始玩了。如果天黑了，一拉铃，若赛特或是雅克兰就会跑来点上蜡烛。看到客厅点上灯了，老神父就会稍微加快脚步下楼来。每天晚上，西洋双六棋棋盘、皮克牌牌桌、三张波士顿牌桌和一张惠斯特牌桌都是满座，加上聊天的，一般是二十五到三十人，不过通常会有多达四十人在场。雅克兰便在其他房间也点上蜡烛。","Every evening, at six o’clock, the long antechamber received its furniture.Each habitue brought his cane, his cloak, his lantern.All these persons knew each other so well, and their habits and ways were so familiarly patriarchal, that if by chance the old Abbe de Sponde was lying down, or Mademoiselle Cormon was in her chamber, neither Josette, the maid, nor Jacquelin, the man-servant, nor Mariette, the cook, informed them.The first comer received the second; then, when the company were sufficiently numerous for whist, piquet, or boston, they began the game without awaiting either the Abbe de Sponde or mademoiselle.If it was dark, Josette or Jacquelin would hasten to light the candles as soon as the first bell rang.Seeing the salon lighted up, the abbe would slowly hurry to come down.Every evening the backgammon and the piquet tables, the three boston tables, and the whist table were filled,—which gave occupation to twenty-five or thirty persons; but as many as forty were usually present.Jacquelin would then light the candles in the other rooms."
"八九点钟，各家仆人开始来到前厅接主人回家。除非有特殊情况，一般十点钟客厅就会空无一人了。这时客人们三五成群地在街上走着，讨论着牌局，或者继续谈着他们盯上的土地，以及遗产分配、继承人之间的纠纷或是议论贵族圈子中的野心。那场景就像是巴黎戏院散场一样。","Between eight and nine o’clock the servants began to arrive in the antechamber to accompany their masters home; and, short of a revolution, no one remained in the salon at ten o’clock.At that hour the guests were departing in groups along the street, discoursing on the game, or continuing conversations on the land they were covetous of buying, on the terms of some one’s will, on quarrels among heirs, on the haughty assumption of the aristocratic portion of the community.It was like Paris when the audience of a theatre disperses."
"有的人大谈诗歌，但其实一窍不通，只是猛烈抨击一下外省的风习罢了。然而，请你用左手擎住额头，一只脚支在壁炉的柴架上，胳膊肘支在膝盖上，好好地想想这所有的一切：这里安静统一的环境，这幢房屋及其内部，这一圈人以及由于知识分子的斤斤计较而愈加彰显的种种利益关系，把这所有的一切像一片金叶一样夹在羊皮纸页里，试问自己，到底何为人生？试着在这两个人当中做个决定：一个人在埃及方尖碑上胡乱写些笑话，另一个人与迪布斯基耶、德瓦卢瓦先生、科尔蒙小姐、法院院长、检察官、德斯蓬德神父、格朗松太太以及其他许多人都玩了二十年的波士顿牌。如果说，每天在同一条小径上迈着同样的步伐不算是幸福，但已近似幸福，饱经风霜的人在回想平静的好处时，会认为这就是幸福。","Certain persons who talk much of poesy and know nothing about it, declaim against the habits of life in the provinces.But put your forehead in your left hand, rest one foot on the fender, and your elbow on your knee; then, if you compass the idea of this quiet and uniform scene, this house and its interior, this company and its interests, heightened by the pettiness of its intellect like goldleaf beaten between sheets of parchment, ask yourself, What is human life?Try to decide between him who scribbles jokes on Egyptian obelisks, and him who has “bostoned” for twenty years with Du Bousquier, Monsieur de Valois, Mademoiselle Cormon, the judge of the court, the king’s attorney, the Abbe de Sponde, Madame Granson, and tutti quanti.If the daily and punctual return of the same steps to the same path is not happiness, it imitates happiness so well that men driven by the storms of an agitated life to reflect upon the blessings of tranquillity would say that here was happiness ENOUGH."
"要将科尔蒙小姐的客厅中人物的重要性用数字表示出来的话，可以这么说，迪布斯基耶这位天生的交际场所统计家已经估计过，经常光顾这里的人在选民团中拥有一百三十一张选票，集中了外省价值一年一百八十万法郎地租的财产。","To reckon the importance of Mademoiselle Cormon’s salon at its true value, it will suffice to say that the born statistician of the society, du Bousquier, had estimated that the persons who frequented it controlled one hundred and thirty-one votes in the electoral college, and mustered among themselves eighteen hundred thousand francs a year from landed estate in the neighborhood."
"然而这个沙龙并不代表整个阿郎松城。高等贵族还有他们自己的沙龙，其次还有税务局长的沙龙。那就像政府开设的行政旅店一样，所有的人都在那里跳舞、算计、调情、恋爱和用餐。这两个沙龙通过与两头都有来往的几个人来联系科尔蒙家，反之亦然。但是科尔蒙沙龙对在另外两个沙龙里发生的事都严加批判。批评他们的晚宴铺张浪费，揣摩他们舞会上吃什么冷饮，议论女人的行为、衣着打扮以及那里又弄出了什么新花样，然后嗤之以鼻。","The town of Alencon, however, was not entirely represented by this salon.The higher aristocracy had a salon of their own; moreover, that of the receiver-general was like an administration inn kept by the government, where society danced, plotted, fluttered, loved, and supped.These two salons communicated by means of certain mixed individuals with the house of Cormon, and vice-versa; but the Cormon establishment sat severely in judgment on the two other camps.The luxury of their dinners was criticised; the ices at their balls were pondered; the behavior of the women, the dresses, and “novelties” there produced were discussed and disapproved."
"科尔蒙小姐就是一家店，在这个商店招牌之下，汇聚了一群有头有脸的人物。于是科尔蒙小姐自然而然地成了德瓦卢瓦骑士和迪布斯基耶这两个野心勃勃、城府颇深之人的进攻目标。对这两个人来说，科尔蒙小姐在贵族阶级就相当于贵族头衔，在军队中就相当于粮食供应商。要建立一个占统治地位的沙龙很不容易，不论是在巴黎还是在外省，而科尔蒙小姐的这个沙龙已经立住脚了。娶了科尔蒙小姐就相当于统治了阿郎松。阿塔纳斯，老姑娘的三个追求者中只有他什么都不算计，他既爱老姑娘这个人，也爱她的财产。","Mademoiselle Cormon, a species of firm, as one might say, under whose name was comprised an imposing coterie, was naturally the aim and object of two ambitious men as deep and wily as the Chevalier de Valois and du Bousquier.To the one as well as to the other, she meant election as deputy, resulting, for the noble, in the peerage, for the purveyor, in a receiver-generalship.A leading salon is a difficult thing to create, whether in Paris or the provinces, and here was one already created.To marry Mademoiselle Cormon was to reign in Alencon.Athanase Granson, the only one of the three suitors for the hand of the old maid who no longer calculated profits, now loved her person as well as her fortune."
"用一句当今的俗话说，这四人的关系不正是一台戏吗？当然，这件事奇怪而又有趣的地方在于，三个人围着这老姑娘默默竞争，而她只是一心想嫁人，却不知道他们之间的竞争。尽管这老姑娘的单身有点不同寻常，有三个人钟情于她，而且她很富有，可为什么她至今还未嫁呢？要解释一下这是怎样造成的、原因是什么，倒也不难。首先，按照她家的习俗，科尔蒙小姐一直都想要嫁给一位贵族，但是从一七八八年到一七九八年，政治形势对她的抱负很不利。尽管她希望能当一位贵夫人，却又害怕革命法庭的裁决。这两种情感强度相当，因此和静力学一样真实的道德法则让她按捺住不动了。这种无定属的状态对于未婚女性来说，只要她们自我感觉还年轻，而且有权利选择丈夫，那就没有什么不好。法国人都知道，拿破仑的政治体系最终造成了很多女人守寡。在拿破仑统治下，女继承人的数目远远超过了要娶妻的小伙子的数目。等到执政府重新恢复了国内的秩序后，外在的困难再次让科尔蒙小姐的婚事和过去一样难以定夺。一方面，罗丝·玛丽·维克图瓦不愿嫁给一个老头；另一方面，由于害怕成为笑柄，她也不能嫁给一个很年轻的小伙子。","To employ the jargon of the day, is there not a singular drama in the situation of these four personages?Surely there is something odd and fantastic in three rivalries silently encompassing a woman who never guessed their existence, in spite of an eager and legitimate desire to be married.And yet, though all these circumstances make the spinsterhood of this old maid an extraordinary thing, it is not difficult to explain how and why, in spite of her fortune and her three lovers, she was still unmarried.In the first place, Mademoiselle Cormon, following the custom and rule of her house, had always desired to marry a nobleman; but from 1788 to 1798 public circumstances were very unfavorable to such pretensions.Though she wanted to be a woman of condition, as the saying is, she was horribly afraid of the Revolutionary tribunal.The two sentiments, equal in force, kept her stationary by a law as true in ethics as it is in statics.This state of uncertain expectation is pleasing to unmarried women as long as they feel themselves young, and in a position to choose a husband.France knows that the political system of Napoleon resulted in making many widows.Under that regime heiresses were entirely out of proportion in numbers to the bachelors who wanted to marry.When the Consulate restored internal order, external difficulties made the marriage of Mademoiselle Cormon as difficult to arrange as it had been in the past.If, on the one hand, Rose-Marie-Victoire refused to marry an old man, on the other, the fear of ridicule forbade her to marry a very young one."
"当时在外省，家家户户都让自己的儿子早早地成婚，以此来免遭征兵。另外还有一点，就是她自己很固执地决定不嫁给士兵，她可不愿嫁一个人后就要把他还给皇帝，她希望他能陪在自己身边。于是，在一八零四年至一八一五年间，她发现她根本没法和那些年轻姑娘竞争到合适的婚姻。","In the provinces, families marry their sons early to escape the conscription.In addition to all this, she was obstinately determined not to marry a soldier: she did not intend to take a man and then give him up to the Emperor; she wanted him for herself alone.With these views, she found it therefore impossible, from 1804 to 1815, to enter the lists with young girls who were rivalling each other for suitable matches."
"除了她对贵族阶级的偏好以外，科尔蒙小姐还有另一个可以原谅的偏执，就是她希望别人娶她是因为爱她这个人本身。你绝对想不到这种愿望对她产生了多大的影响。她用尽心机来给她的追求者下套，以便考验他们的真心。她的圈套设计得非常巧妙，以至于那些倒霉蛋全都中计了，并且在不知不觉中被她的那些考验给淘汰掉。科尔蒙小姐并不研究他们，而是观察他们。往往一句草率的话，一个玩笑（她常常没法理解），都足以让她把这些追求者当作资格不够而刷掉：比如认为这个人心肠冷酷或是不够体贴，那个人会说谎而且不信教，另一个人光想着靠结婚来捞钱，这个人性格不好，不能使她幸福，那个人家里可能会有什么遗传性痛风，另一个人有些让她害怕的不道德的经历。像教会一样，她要求她的祭坛边是个尊贵的牧师。她甚至希望别人娶她是因为看中了她的所谓的缺点或是不够漂亮，而别的女性都希望人家看中的是她们不具备的优点或是认为她们很美。科尔蒙小姐的抱负来自于女性最高尚的情感，她渴望结婚后再让她的丈夫知道她有着千百种美德，而其他的女性往往是在婚后显露出她们原来极力掩饰的种种缺陷。但是她的苦心被误解了。这位心灵高贵的姑娘遇到的都是俗不可耐的人，他们心里都是在计算利益，对高贵的情感一窍不通。","Besides her predilection for the nobility, Mademoiselle Cormon had another and very excusable mania: that of being loved for herself.You could hardly believe the lengths to which this desire led her.She employed her mind on setting traps for her possible lovers, in order to test their real sentiments.Her nets were so well laid that the luckless suitors were all caught, and succumbed to the test she applied to them without their knowledge.Mademoiselle Cormon did not study them; she watched them.A single word said heedlessly, a joke (that she often was unable to understand), sufficed to make her reject an aspirant as unworthy: this one had neither heart nor delicacy; that one told lies, and was not religious; a third only wanted to coin money under the cloak of marriage; another was not of a nature to make a woman happy; here she suspected hereditary gout; there certain immoral antecedents alarmed her.Like the Church, she required a noble priest at her altar; she even wanted to be married for imaginary ugliness and pretended defects, just as other women wish to be loved for the good qualities they have not, and for imaginary beauties.Mademoiselle Cormon’s ambition took its rise in the most delicate and sensitive feminine feeling; she longed to reward a lover by revealing to him a thousand virtues after marriage, as other women then betray the imperfections they have hitherto concealed.But she was ill understood.The noble woman met with none but common souls in whom the reckoning of actual interests was paramount, and who knew nothing of the nobler calculations of sentiment."
"她越是接近人们巧妙地称之为“第二春”的年纪，越是疑心重重。她故意呈现对自己最不利的一面，并且装扮得如此逼真，以至于最后几个慕名前来的追求者开始犹豫要不要和这样一个人结合了。男人总是希望女人已经形成了良好的品行，他们可没工夫去研究科尔蒙小姐掩藏的美德。科尔蒙小姐越发害怕别人要娶她是因为她的财产，因此也越发心神不宁，疑神疑鬼。她追求富人，而富人又看不上她；她害怕穷人，她不相信穷人不在乎她的财产。在对婚姻的种种失望中，这可怜的姑娘变得鄙视男人，开始以错误的眼光看待他们。她的性格必然渐渐变得愤世嫉俗，她的言谈愈加尖酸起来，而且目光也多了几分严峻。她的独身生活使得她的生活习惯越来越刻板，因为她在对命运的失望中极力完善自己。多么高贵的一种报复方式！她要为上帝精雕细琢她这颗被男人所抛弃的天然钻石。不久之后，公众舆论开始针对她了,因为社会判定她是个不结婚的独立女人，不管她是吓跑了追求者还是拒绝了别人的追求。每个人都认为她的拒婚背后有着不为人知的原因，总是胡乱猜测。有的人说她是畸形，有的人说她有不外露的缺陷。但实际上，这个可怜的姑娘如圣人一般纯洁，如婴儿一般健康，心中充满了爱心，造物主原本是要让她享受所有的欢乐、所有的幸福，以及做母亲的种种劳累的。","The farther she advanced towards that fatal epoch so adroitly called the “second youth,” the more her distrust increased.She affected to present herself in the most unfavorable light, and played her part so well that the last wooers hesitated to link their fate to that of a person whose virtuous blind-man’s-buff required an amount of penetration that men who want the virtuous ready-made would not bestow upon it.The constant fear of being married for her money rendered her suspicious and uneasy beyond all reason.She turned to the rich men; but the rich are in search of great marriages; she feared the poor men, in whom she denied the disinterestedness she sought so eagerly.After each disappointment in marriage, the poor lady, led to despise mankind, began to see them all in a false light.Her character acquired, necessarily, a secret misanthropy, which threw a tinge of bitterness into her conversation, and some severity into her eyes.Celibacy gave to her manners and habits a certain increasing rigidity; for she endeavored to sanctify herself in despair of fate.Noble vengeance!She was cutting for God the rough diamond rejected by man.Before long public opinion was against her; for society accepts the verdict an independent woman renders on herself by not marrying, either through losing suitors or rejecting them.Everybody supposed that these rejections were founded on secret reasons, always ill interpreted.One said she was deformed; another suggested some hidden fault; but the poor girl was really as pure as a saint, as healthy as an infant, and full of loving kindness; Nature had intended her for all the pleasures, all the joys, and all the fatigues of motherhood."
"科尔蒙小姐在相貌上没有任何优势。她只有一种所谓的魔鬼之美，其实就是青春焕发。从神学上来说是不合理的，魔鬼永远不可能青春焕发，不过魔鬼总是希望自己能保持凉爽和清醒，也许从这点考虑还算解释得通这种说法。这位女继承人长着一双宽大的平足。每次下雨的时候，她总是提起连衫裙，露出她的腿走路（她这么做确实是无意的）。你简直无法相信那是女人的腿。她的腿青筋突起，腿肚子像水手的一样壮实。她身材粗壮，像奶妈一样肥胖，手臂强壮有力，双手通红，这一切都让她构成诺曼底美人一样又白又胖的体型。她的眼睛突起，眼珠颜色不明，让她本就圆圆的脸更加没有任何高贵之气，而倒是赋予一种很适合她这老姑娘的好奇和害羞的表情。就算罗丝以前不是如此天真无邪（其实她本就如此），也让人感觉她是这样的。她的鹰钩鼻和她的窄小的前额形成鲜明对比，很少看到她这种鼻子没有美丽的前额相配。尽管她的嘴唇又红又厚，是心地善良的标志，但是她那突出的前额让人觉得她没有什么头脑，缺乏由智慧引导的内心，做善事也让人觉得没什么好赞美的。对于品德高尚的人，人们总是严厉指责他的缺点；而对于道德败坏的人，人们往往只说他好的一面。","Mademoiselle Cormon did not possess in her person an obliging auxiliary to her desires.She had no other beauty than that very improperly called la beaute du diable, which consists of a buxom freshness of youth that the devil, theologically speaking, could never have,—though perhaps the expression may be explained by the constant desire that must surely possess him to cool and refresh himself.The feet of the heiress were broad and flat.Her leg, which she often exposed to sight by her manner (be it said without malice) of lifting her gown when it rained, could never have been taken for the leg of a woman.It was sinewy, with a thick projecting calf like a sailor’s.A stout waist, the plumpness of a wet-nurse, strong dimpled arms, red hands, were all in keeping with the swelling outlines and the fat whiteness of Norman beauty.Projecting eyes, undecided in color, gave to her face, the rounded outline of which had no dignity, an air of surprise and sheepish simplicity, which was suitable perhaps for an old maid.If Rose had not been, as she was, really innocent, she would have seemed so.An aquiline nose contrasted curiously with the narrowness of her forehead; for it is rare that that form of nose does not carry with it a fine brow.In spite of her thick red lips, a sign of great kindliness, the forehead revealed too great a lack of ideas to allow of the heart being guided by intellect; she was evidently benevolent without grace.How severely we reproach Virtue for its defects, and how full of indulgence we all are for the pleasanter qualities of Vice!"
"罗丝·科尔蒙的栗色长发让她的脸呈现出一种来自活力和丰满的美——这是她最明显的外部特征。在她充满期待的年代，她总是故意将头摆成四分之一的侧面姿势，以便露出她漂亮的耳朵。耳朵在她那白皙略显蓝色静脉的颈部与太阳穴之间清楚地显露出来，加上她浓密的头发，更显迷人。这么看过去，再配上舞会礼服，她可能看上去还算漂亮。她那圆滚滚的身材和她充满活力的健康体质事实上曾经让帝国时期的军官们惊叹不已地感慨道：“多漂亮的一位姑娘啊！”","Chestnut hair of extraordinary length gave to Rose Cormon’s face a beauty which results from vigor and abundance,—the physical qualities most apparent in her person.In the days of her chief pretensions, Rose affected to hold her head at the three-quarter angle, in order to exhibit a very pretty ear, which detached itself from the blue-veined whiteness of her throat and temples, set off, as it was, by her wealth of hair.Seen thus in a ball-dress, she might have seemed handsome.Her protuberant outlines and her vigorous health did, in fact, draw from the officers of the Empire the approving exclamation,—“What a fine slip of a girl!”"
"但是，随着时间流逝，平静而循规蹈矩的生活让她更加肥胖了，肥肉已不知不觉地堆满了她的全身，完全破坏了她原有的身材比例。现在没有一件紧身衣能够让人看出这可怜姑娘的臀部在哪儿了，她全身简直就是用单一模具铸成的。她年轻时上半身的和谐已不复存在了，那肥大的身躯让人担心她如果一弯腰，会被她的上半身拖倒在地。但是大自然早就赋予了她一种天然的平衡力，对于使用裙撑的女人来说是没有必要的，而在罗丝身上则所有一切都是真实的。罗丝的下巴有三层，缩短了脖子的长度，让她的头转起来不那么容易。罗丝没有皱纹，只有肉褶子，有人开玩笑说为了不让皮肤发炎，她得像婴儿一样抹上爽身粉。","But, as years rolled on, this plumpness, encouraged by a tranquil, wholesome life, had insensibly so ill spread itself over the whole of Mademoiselle Cormon’s body that her primitive proportions were destroyed.At the present moment, no corset could restore a pair of hips to the poor lady, who seemed to have been cast in a single mould.The youthful harmony of her bosom existed no longer; and its excessive amplitude made the spectator fear that if she stooped its heavy masses might topple her over.But nature had provided against this by giving her a natural counterpoise, which rendered needless the deceitful adjunct of a bustle; in Rose Cormon everything was genuine.Her chin, as it doubled, reduced the length of her neck, and hindered the easy carriage of her head.Rose had no wrinkles, but she had folds of flesh; and jesters declared that to save chafing she powdered her skin as they do an infant’s."
"就是这么一个硕大肥胖的人，竟让像阿塔纳斯这样血气方刚的年轻人对她爱慕不已。年轻人的想象力基本上是贪婪而大胆的，喜欢在这堆活肉上流连忘返。罗丝像是一只肥嫩的鹧鸪，引诱着美食家的餐刀。从前许多债台高筑的人都可能会心甘情愿地娶科尔蒙小姐，让她幸福。","This ample person offered to a young man full of ardent desires like Athanase an attraction to which he had succumbed.Young imaginations, essentially eager and courageous, like to rove upon these fine living sheets of flesh.Rose was like a plump partridge attracting the knife of a gourmet.Many an elegant deep in debt would very willingly have resigned himself to make the happiness of Mademoiselle Cormon."
"哎呀，可现在这可怜的姑娘已经四十岁了！她长期努力，希望能让自己的生命具有女性的意义，可是现在仍然未婚，于是她用最严格的宗教活动来加强自己的品德。她早就求助于宗教，宗教对于长期压抑的童贞女来说是最好的安慰。在过去的三年间，一位听忏悔的神父相当愚昧地让科尔蒙小姐走上苦行的道路，他嘱咐她用苦鞭。如果现代医学是对的话，苦鞭只能产生与这可怜的神父所期待的完全相反的效果，可惜这神父的医学知识非常有限。","But, alas! The poor girl was now forty years old.At this period, after vainly seeking to put into her life those interests which make the Woman, and finding herself forced to be still unmarried, she fortified her virtue by stern religious practices.She had recourse to religion, the great consoler of oppressed virginity.A confessor had, for the last three years, directed Mademoiselle Cormon rather stupidly in the path of maceration; he advised the use of scourging, which, if modern medical science is to be believed, produces an effect quite the contrary to that expected by the worthy priest, whose hygienic knowledge was not extensive."
"这荒谬的方法开始在罗丝·科尔蒙的脸上显出寺院的色调，她伤心地看到自己白皙的皮肤变成了宣布成年期到来的黄色。她的上唇嘴角的绒毛开始扩大并变黑，勾勒出像一缕烟似的痕迹，她的太阳穴开始出现栗色的斑点，总之她已开始衰老了！阿郎松人人都知道科尔蒙小姐遭受着脑充血的折磨。她向德瓦卢瓦骑士坦白自己的疾病，说她每天洗多少次脚，并且询问他关于制冷剂的问题。这种时候，精明的老绅士就会掏出自己的鼻烟盒，凝视着戈里扎公主，以总结般的语气说道：","These absurd practices were beginning to shed a monastic tint over the face of Rose Cormon, who now saw with something like despair her white skin assuming the yellow tones which proclaim maturity.A slight down on her upper lip, about the corners, began to spread and darken like a trail of smoke; her temples grew shiny; decadence was beginning!It was authentic in Alencon that Mademoiselle Cormon suffered from rush of blood to the head.She confided her ills to the Chevalier de Valois, enumerating her foot-baths, and consulting him as to refrigerants.On such occasions the shrewd old gentleman would pull out his snuff-box, gaze at the Princess Goritza, and say, by way of conclusion:—"
"“真正的镇静剂，我亲爱的小姐，是找一位好心善良的丈夫。”","“The right composing draught, my dear lady, is a good and kind husband.”"
"“但是我能相信谁呢？”她答道。","“But whom can one trust?” she replied."
"骑士则会将落在他马甲衣褶里的或是棱纹塔夫绸马裤上的鼻烟粒拍掉。任何人看了他这个举动都觉得再自然不过了，但这位可怜的老姑娘见了总是会心神不安。","The chevalier would then brush away the snuff which had settled in the folds of his waistcoat or his paduasoy breeches.To the world at large this gesture would have seemed very natural; but it always gave extreme uneasiness to the poor woman."
"这种单身女人渴望对象的愿望是如此强烈，以至于罗丝不敢正视一个男人，害怕对方能从她的眼神里看出她充满整个内心的痛苦。尽管她对某些还适合她的男人有想法，但是她害怕别人指责她愚蠢、待人不礼貌，便任性地转为冷淡的态度，也许是受以前她那些做法的影响。她圈子里的大部分人都无法理解她的动机，其实她的动机是很高尚的。那些人认为她是在报复那些她已经拒绝或是将要拒绝的单身汉们。一八一五年开始之际，罗丝已经到了那个不愿向人承认的可怕年纪了。她四十二岁了。这时她对婚姻的渴望愈发强烈，已经到了偏执狂的地步，因为她很清楚她将要最后失去生儿育女的机会了。在所有一切的欲望中，她最渴望的就是生几个孩子了。阿郎松全城没有任何人认为这个贞洁的姑娘有对放荡生活的一丝欲望。可以说，她只是囫囵吞枣地爱，却丝毫没有想象过爱情。罗丝是天主教的阿涅丝，不过与莫里哀笔下的阿涅丝相比，她连一个鬼点子都想不出来。","The violence of this hope without an object was so great that Rose was afraid to look a man in the face lest he should perceive in her eyes the feelings that filled her soul.By a wilfulness, which was perhaps only the continuation of her earlier methods, though she felt herself attracted toward the men who might still suit her, she was so afraid of being accused of folly that she treated them ungraciously.Most persons in her society, being incapable of appreciating her motives, which were always noble, explained her manner towards her co-celibates as the revenge of a refusal received or expected.When the year 1815 began, Rose had reached that fatal age which she dared not avow.She was forty-two years old.Her desire for marriage then acquired an intensity which bordered on monomania, for she saw plainly that all chance of progeny was about to escape her; and the thing which in her celestial ignorance she desired above all things was the possession of children.Not a person in all Alencon ever attributed to this virtuous woman a single desire for amorous license.She loved, as it were, in bulk without the slightest imagination of love.Rose was a Catholic Agnes, incapable of inventing even one of the wiles of Moliere’s Agnes."
"这几个月来，她觉得又有了盼头。帝国部队的解散以及王国军队的重组让许多军官的命运发生了变化。不少人回到故乡，有的带半薪，有的有津贴，有的没有津贴——每个人都希望能终结自己不幸的命运，而他们的终结对于科尔蒙小姐来说可能是一个甜蜜的开端。回到阿郎松一带的人，自然总会有些勇敢又令人尊敬的军官吧，尤其是他们身体健壮，年龄合适。他们的性格可以给持波拿马政见的人充当护照，或者他们为了恢复失去的地位，甘于加入保王党。在本年初，科尔蒙小姐一直抱着这样的希望。","For some months past she had counted on chance.The disbandment of the Imperial troops and the reorganization of the Royal army caused a change in the destination of many officers, who returned, some on half-pay, others with or without a pension, to their native towns,—all having a desire to counteract their luckless fate, and to end their life in a way which might to Rose Cormon be a happy beginning of hers.It would surely be strange if, among those who returned to Alencon or its neighborhood, no brave, honorable, and, above all, sound and healthy officer of suitable age could be found, whose character would be a passport among Bonaparte opinions; or some ci-devant noble who, to regain his lost position, would join the ranks of the royalists.This hope kept Mademoiselle Cormon in heart during the early months of that year."
"但是，天晓得，回到这里的士兵不是太老就是太年轻，不是太激进地拥护波拿马就是品行太坏。总之，他们个个都不能和科尔蒙小姐的品德、地位和财产相称，这可让科尔蒙小姐一天比一天绝望起来。这可怜的姑娘无助地向上帝祷告，希望给她送一个丈夫来，可以让她享受基督徒的幸福。她大概命中注定要殉道而死，而且至死都是处女，因为至今还没有一个合适的丈夫人选出现。每晚在她家里的谈话让她得知来阿郎松的每一个陌生人，以及他们的财产、地位和品德。但是阿郎松不是一个吸引游客的城市，它不坐落在通往任何一省省府的道路上，即使是从布雷斯特到巴黎去的水手也从不在这里歇脚。这可怜的姑娘最终明白她只能找一个当地人嫁了。现在她的眼睛开始流露出一种原始的神情，而对此狡猾的骑士在掏出他的鼻烟盒，凝视着戈里扎公主的同时，通过狡黠的一瞥就发现了。德瓦卢瓦骑士先生知道，在女性的道德规范里，对爱情的忠诚被认为是未来婚姻的誓言。","But, alas! all the soldiers who thus returned were either too old or too young; too aggressively Bonapartist, or too dissipated; in short, their several situations were out of keeping with the rank, fortune, and morals of Mademoiselle Cormon, who now grew daily more and more desperate.The poor woman in vain prayed to God to send her a husband with whom she could be piously happy: it was doubtless written above that she should die both virgin and martyr; no man suitable for a husband presented himself.The conversations in her salon every evening kept her informed of the arrival of all strangers in Alencon, and of the facts of their fortunes, rank, and habits.But Alencon is not a town which attracts visitors; it is not on the road to any capital; even sailors, travelling from Brest to Paris, never stop there.The poor woman ended by admitting to herself that she was reduced to the aborigines.Her eye now began to assume a certain savage expression, to which the malicious chevalier responded by a shrewd look as he drew out his snuff-box and gazed at the Princess Goritza.Monsieur de Valois was well aware that in the feminine ethics of love fidelity to a first attachment is considered a pledge for the future."
"当然我们必须承认，科尔蒙小姐不够聪明，她不懂那鼻烟盒的诡计。她加倍警惕抑制她的“邪念”，用最刻板的虔诚和最严格的原则来隐藏她私人生活秘密那难忍的痛苦。每次夜晚客人们离去了之后，她便想到自己已逝去的青春，已衰老的容貌，想到大自然造物的祝愿已落了空。她一面将自己的激情奉献在十字架脚下（像是不能得以发表的诗篇），一面郑重许诺，如果偶然再有任何一位男子来求婚，她一定不再对他进行任何考验，而是立刻接受他的求婚，不管他是什么样的人。这时她甚至愿意嫁给一个少尉、一个烟鬼。她愿意用关心体贴、和蔼可亲和无比的柔情，将他感化成世界上最好的男人，哪怕他欠了一屁股债也没有关系。","But Mademoiselle Cormon—we must admit it—was wanting in intellect, and did not understand the snuff-box performance.She redoubled her vigilance against “the evil spirit”; her rigid devotion and fixed principles kept her cruel sufferings hidden among the mysteries of private life.Every evening, after the company had left her, she thought of her lost youth, her faded bloom, the hopes of thwarted nature; and, all the while immolating her passions at the feet of the Cross (like poems condemned to stay in a desk), she resolved firmly that if, by chance, any suitor presented himself, to subject him to no tests, but to accept him at once for whatever he might be.She even went so far as to think of marrying a sub-lieutenant, a man who smoked tobacco, whom she proposed to render, by dint of care and kindness, one of the best men in the world, although he was hampered with debts."
"但只有在夜深人静时，她才会这么想，愿意在这些婚姻中扮演守护天使的高尚角色。第二天，尽管若赛特发现女主人的床铺乱成一团，但是科尔蒙小姐已经恢复了自己的尊严，并且只能接受一位四十岁相当有钱的土地拥有者的求婚，而且还必须是相貌仍然青春的年轻人的感觉。","But it was only in the silence of night watches that these fantastic marriages, in which she played the sublime role of guardian angel, took place.The next day, though Josette found her mistress’ bed in a tossed and tumbled condition, Mademoiselle Cormon had recovered her dignity, and could only think of a man of forty, a land-owner, well preserved, and a quasi-young man."
"德斯蓬德神父对他外甥女的婚姻基本帮不上什么忙。这个老实人现在已经七十岁了，他把法国革命的浩劫归之为上帝的旨意，认为是上帝迫不及待地要惩罚放荡荒淫的教会人士。因此他投身于早已为人所抛弃的从前隐士们要上天堂所走的道路，默默地过着禁欲主义的生活，从外表上看不出有什么成效。他不让外人知道他从事的慈善事业，他不断祈祷和苦修；他认为在这多事之秋，所有的神父都应该这样做，他正是以身作则。他在人们面前总是露出平静的笑脸，其实他早已达到超凡脱俗的境界，现在只考虑穷人，考虑教会的需要，考虑自己的永生。他让他的外甥女去经营管理他的财产，由外甥女交给他收入，并且支付给她一份微薄的膳宿费，以便将剩下的钱统统用在秘密的救济金或教会的捐赠上。","The Abbe de Sponde was incapable of giving his niece the slightest aid in her matrimonial manoeuvres.The worthy soul, now seventy years of age, attributed the disasters of the French Revolution to the design of Providence, eager to punish a dissolute Church.He had therefore flung himself into the path, long since abandoned, which anchorites once followed in order to reach heaven: he led an ascetic life without proclaiming it, and without external credit.He hid from the world his works of charity, his continual prayers, his penances; he thought that all priests should have acted thus during the days of wrath and terror, and he preached by example.While presenting to the world a calm and smiling face, he had ended by detaching himself utterly from earthly interests; his mind turned exclusively to sufferers, to the needs of the Church, and to his own salvation.He left the management of his property to his niece, who gave him the income of it, and to whom he paid a slender board in order to spend the surplus in secret alms and gifts to the Church."
"这位神父的全部慈爱都集中在他的外甥女身上，外甥女也将他看作父亲。但是神父是位心不在焉的父亲，完全看不到外甥女遭受的肉欲的折磨，还感谢上帝让他亲爱的女儿保持独身。因为他自年轻时代起就接受了圣约翰·克立索斯通的思想。克立索斯通写道：“处女身份远胜过婚姻身份，就有如天使远远高于人类一样。”科尔蒙小姐习惯于尊敬她的舅父，不敢对舅父提起半点关于她迫切想要结婚的想法。这位可敬的人已经习惯了这个家的生活方式，对于他自己来说，他也不愿意接受某个人成为他外甥女的丈夫。由于他太过专注于想着给别人减轻痛苦，或是沉醉于祈祷中，德斯蓬德神父常常出神，而这房子的常客认为他总是心不在焉。不论什么情况，他都很少说话，保持着友好和善的沉默。他是个身材高大、干瘪、举止庄重的人，尽管他的面容常露出友好的情感和平静的内心，但是他的存在总是伴着神圣威严的气氛。他很喜欢伏尔泰风格的德瓦卢瓦骑士。这两个人分别是贵族遗老和教士遗老，尽管有着不同的品行，却也认同彼此的一般特点。而且，骑士对神父也分外热情，就像他像慈父似的对待那些女工们一样。","All the abbe’s affections were concentrated on his niece, who regarded him as a father, but an abstracted father, unable to conceive the agitations of the flesh, and thanking God for maintaining his dear daughter in a state of celibacy; for he had, from his youth up, adopted the principles of Saint John Chrysostom, who wrote that “the virgin state is as far above the marriage state as the angel is above humanity.”Accustomed to reverence her uncle, Mademoiselle Cormon dared not initiate him into the desires which filled her soul for a change of state.The worthy man, accustomed, on his side, to the ways of the house, would scarcely have liked the introduction of a husband.Preoccupied by the sufferings he soothed, lost in the depths of prayer, the Abbe de Sponde had periods of abstraction which the habitues of the house regarded as absent-mindedness.In any case, he talked little; but his silence was affable and benevolent.He was a man of great height and spare, with grave and solemn manners, though his face expressed all gentle sentiments and an inward calm; while his mere presence carried with it a sacred authority.He was very fond of the Voltairean chevalier.Those two majestic relics of the nobility and clergy, though of very different habits and morals, recognized each other by their generous traits.Besides, the chevalier was as unctuous with the abbe as he was paternal with the grisettes."
"有人可能会猜科尔蒙小姐一定会想方设法以达到自己的目的，因此在女性使用的巧计中，她一定会精心打扮自己，袒胸露臂，施展自己的女性魅力。不，她绝不会这样做！她像是坚守岗位的士兵，依然威严而坚定地穿着她的高领绣花衬衣。她的连衣裙、帽子、各种花边服饰都是在阿郎松的女服女帽店里定做的，店主是两个驼背的姐妹，倒还有些审美能力。不管这两位店主怎么劝说，科尔蒙小姐还是拒绝采用些能显得更漂亮的花招，她喜欢什么都多多益善，肉多，羽毛装饰也要多。但也许她长袍上的重重装饰与她的外表是最相称的呢。让那些人嘲笑这个可怜的姑娘好了。你要是那种不计较真实情感的形式，而仅仅因为它的存在而感到敬佩的人，你就会认为她心灵高尚了。","Some persons may fancy that Mademoiselle Cormon used every means to attain her end; and that among the legitimate lures of womanhood she devoted herself to dress, wore low-necked gowns, and employed the negative coquetries of a magnificent display of arms.Not at all!She was as heroic and immovable in her high-necked chemisette as a sentry in his box.Her gowns, bonnets, and chiffons were all cut and made by the dressmaker and the milliner of Alencon, two hump-backed sisters, who were not without some taste.In spite of the entreaties of these artists, Mademoiselle Cormon refused to employ the airy deceits of elegance; she chose to be substantial in all things, flesh and feathers.But perhaps the heavy fashion of her gowns was best suited to her cast of countenance.Let those laugh who will at this poor girl; you would have thought her sublime, O generous souls!who care but little what form true feeling takes, but admire it where it IS."
"读到这里，有些轻浮的人可能会怀疑这个故事的真实性了。他们会说，法国根本没有这样愚蠢的姑娘，居然不知道让男人上钩的技巧；科尔蒙小姐是个很特殊的例外，稍微有点常识的人就不应该介绍她这种例外；就算是最贞洁最傻的女孩都会知道如何让她的鱼儿上钩。可是，只要想想高贵的罗马天主教使徒在布列塔尼和原阿郎松公爵领地仍然存在，这些评论就站不住脚了。信仰和虔诚是不容许花招的。科尔蒙小姐走在永生的道路上，她甘愿忍受当处女的苦难，也不愿忍受使花招所犯下的罪过。一个姑娘一旦以严苛的美德武装自己，她在道德方面是不会妥协的。因此，她对爱情和自身利益都很看重，而且态度很坚决。如今，宗教被一些人当作是一种有用的手段，对另一些人而言是诗歌。这时，让我们来大胆地提出一个尖刻的看法吧。虔诚会造成一种道德上的眼病。感谢上帝的恩泽，这种眼病让那些走在通往永生之路上的人看不见许多世俗的琐事。总之，虔诚的人在很多问题上都是愚蠢的。这种愚蠢证明了这些虔诚的信徒花了多么大的力气才转向神圣的事业，但伏尔泰主义者的德瓦卢瓦骑士认为，很难确定到底是愚蠢的人自然就会变成虔诚的信徒呢，还是虔诚会将聪明的年轻姑娘变得愚蠢。请仔细想想这一点：最纯洁的天主教道德观包含着它对爱情的种种理解，对上帝旨意的虔诚服从，相信人类生命的任何部分都打上了上帝的指纹。这道神秘的光芒照入人类历史的最深处，会让至今仍有信仰的人感到释然，他们的信念会更加扩大。而且，如果确有愚蠢之处，为什么不关心愚蠢造成的不幸，以及天才造成的不幸呢？而且前者在社会上远比后者普遍得多。","Here some light-minded person may exclaim against the truth of this statement; they will say that there is not in all France a girl so silly as to be ignorant of the art of angling for men; that Mademoiselle Cormon is one of those monstrous exceptions which commonsense should prevent a writer from using as a type; that the most virtuous and also the silliest girl who desires to catch her fish knows well how to bait the hook.But these criticisms fall before the fact that the noble catholic, apostolic, and Roman religion is still erect in Brittany and in the ancient duchy of Alencon.Faith and piety admit of no subtleties.Mademoiselle Cormon trod the path of salvation, preferring the sorrows of her virginity so cruelly prolonged to the evils of trickery and the sin of a snare.In a woman armed with a scourge virtue could never compromise; consequently both love and self-interest were forced to seek her, and seek her resolutely.And here let us have the courage to make a cruel observation, in days when religion is nothing more than a useful means to some, and a poesy to others.Devotion causes a moral ophthalmia.By some providential grace, it takes from souls on the road to eternity the sight of many little earthly things.In a word, pious persons, devotes, are stupid on various points.This stupidity proves with what force they turn their minds to celestial matters; although the Voltairean Chevalier de Valois declared that it was difficult to decide whether stupid people became naturally pious, or whether piety had the effect of making intelligent young women stupid.But reflect upon this carefully: the purest catholic virtue, with its loving acceptance of all cups, with its pious submission to the will of God, with its belief in the print of the divine finger on the clay of all earthly life, is the mysterious light which glides into the innermost folds of human history, setting them in relief and magnifying them in the eyes of those who still have Faith.Besides, if there be stupidity, why not concern ourselves with the sorrows of stupidity as well as with the sorrows of genius?The former is a social element infinitely more abundant than the latter."
"所以，在人们看来，科尔蒙小姐的过失是因为处女的无知而造成的。她一点也不善于观察，她对她追求者的态度证明了这一点。这时，就算一位从没有读过小说的十六岁少女，也能从阿塔纳斯的目光中读出一百章爱情故事，但科尔蒙小姐却什么也看不出来。她自己很腼腆，却从没有想过别人也会腼腆。她没有发觉，阿塔纳斯说话之所以发颤是因为一种不能说出来的感情。她最初对于感情最精细的想像影响了她最初的婚姻观，而现在她又不能在阿塔纳斯身上找到这些感情。有些人对于这些精神现象很清楚，知道情商和智商是不一样的，正如天才的智慧和精神的高尚是不一样的。十全十美的人是如此稀少，以至于苏格拉底这位人类最高贵的珍宝（与他那个时代的骨象学家一样）认为他生来就是要成为一个坏人，而且还是很坏的那种。一位伟大的将军可以在苏黎世拯救他的国家，也可以与粮食供应商合伙赢利。一位伟大的音乐家能构思出最美妙的音乐，也可以抄袭别人的乐章。一位感情真挚的女性也可能是个愚昧的人。总之，虔诚的女教徒可以有高尚的灵魂，但却无法识别她身边的有着同样高尚灵魂的人。由于生理缺陷所造成的怪诞想法与在精神和道德领域的反复无常是如出一辙的。","So, then, Mademoiselle Cormon was guilty in the eyes of the world of the divine ignorance of virgins.She was no observer, and her behavior with her suitors proved it.At this very moment, a young girl of sixteen, who had never opened a novel, would have read a hundred chapters of a love story in the eyes of Athanase Granson, where Mademoiselle Cormon saw absolutely nothing.Shy herself, she never suspected shyness in others; she did not recognize in the quavering tones of his speech the force of a sentiment he could not utter.Capable of inventing those refinements of sentimental grandeur which hindered her marriage in her early years, she yet could not recognize them in Athanase.This moral phenomenon will not seem surprising to persons who know that the qualities of the heart are as distinct from those of the mind as the faculties of genius are from the nobility of soul.A perfect, all-rounded man is so rare that Socrates, one of the noblest pearls of humanity, declared (as a phrenologist of that day) that he was born to be a scamp, and a very bad one.A great general may save his country at Zurich, and take commissions from purveyors.A great musician may conceive the sublimest music and commit a forgery.A woman of true feeling may be a fool.In short, a devote may have a sublime soul and yet be unable to recognize the tones of a noble soul beside her.The caprices produced by physical infirmities are equally to be met with in the mental and moral regions."
"这位善良的姑娘为每年只能为自己和舅父做蜜饯而感到伤心，变得几乎有些滑稽可笑了。有人因为她的优点而同情她，也有人因为她的缺点而同情她，现在他们都会嘲笑她一次次错过的婚姻机会。人们不止一次地谈论，这么多的财产以及科尔蒙小姐的积蓄加上她将继承的她舅舅的遗产，最后会怎样处理。很久以来，人们就认为她有某种怪癖，虽然她的外表看上去不像。在外省，别人是不允许你有怪癖的，有怪癖意味着别人无法理解你的想法；在外省，人们要求智商和品德习惯都要相等。","This good creature, who grieved at making her yearly preserves for no one but her uncle and herself, was becoming almost ridiculous.Those who felt a sympathy for her on account of her good qualities, and others on account of her defects, now made fun of her abortive marriages.More than one conversation was based on what would become of so fine a property, together with the old maid’s savings and her uncle’s inheritance.For some time past she had been suspected of being au fond, in spite of appearances, an “original.”In the provinces it was not permissible to be original: being original means having ideas that are not understood by others; the provinces demand equality of mind as well as equality of manners and customs."
"从一八零四年开始，科尔蒙小姐的婚姻似乎已成了一个大难题，阿郎松的人甚至用“科尔蒙小姐的婚姻”来指代滑稽可笑的失败。在法国，讽刺精神已成为一种必需，连这么一个好姑娘也能激起阿郎松人的冷嘲热讽。科尔蒙小姐确实是个好人，她不仅接待全城的人来她家聚会，她还慈善、虔诚，从来不说一句坏话，而且她和城里居民的一般思想和风俗习惯都保持一致。人们喜欢她，认为她是他们生活的象征；她完全遵守外省的老习惯，从未改变过；她接受外省人的偏见，维护他们的利益，并且非常喜欢他们。","The marriage of Mademoiselle Cormon seemed, after 1804, a thing so problematical that the saying “married like Mademoiselle Cormon” became proverbial in Alencon as applied to ridiculous failures.Surely the sarcastic mood must be an imperative need in France, that so excellent a woman should excite the laughter of Alencon.Not only did she receive the whole society of the place at her house, not only was she charitable, pious, incapable of saying an unkind thing, but she was fully in accord with the spirit of the place and the habits and customs of the inhabitants, who liked her as the symbol of their lives; she was absolutely inlaid into the ways of the provinces; she had never quitted them; she imbibed all their prejudices; she espoused all their interests; she adored them."
"虽然她每年有一万八千法郎的地产收入，这在外省可是很大一笔收入了，她的生活习惯却保持与并不这么富有的人家一样。她到位于普雷博戴的田庄去时，坐的是一辆破旧的藤车，车上架着两个白皮座，由一匹气喘吁吁的母马拉着，两块风吹雨淋的旧皮帘当作车门，几乎关不上。全城都认识这辆马车，雅克兰精心照管着这辆车，把它当作巴黎最漂亮的带蓬双座四轮轿式马车。因为他家小姐很看重这辆车，已经用了十二年了。她自己也很高兴地告诉别人这一点。城里的大部分居民都很感激科尔蒙小姐，因为她没有通过大摆阔气来羞辱他们。我们甚至可以想像，如果她真从巴黎弄来一辆敞篷四轮马车，人们对此的恶意评论要远胜过对她错过各种婚姻机会的无聊议论。不管怎么说，最华丽的马车也只能像破旧的藤车一样将她拉到普雷博戴去。现在外省的人只考虑目的，而不在乎手段是否漂亮华丽，只要有效就行。","In spite of her income of eighteen thousand francs from landed property, a very considerable fortune in the provinces, she lived on a footing with families who were less rich.When she went to her country-place at Prebaudet, she drove there in an old wicker carriole, hung on two straps of white leather, drawn by a wheezy mare, and scarcely protected by two leather curtains rusty with age.This carriole, known to all the town, was cared for by Jacquelin as though it were the finest coupe in all Paris.Mademoiselle valued it; she had used it for twelve years,—a fact to which she called attention with the triumphant joy of happy avarice.Most of the inhabitants of the town were grateful to Mademoiselle Cormon for not humiliating them by the luxury she could have displayed; we may even believe that had she imported a caleche from Paris they would have gossiped more about that than about her various matrimonial failures.The most brilliant equipage would, after all, have only taken her, like the old carriole, to Prebaudet.Now the provinces, which look solely to results, care little about the beauty or elegance of the means, provided they are efficient."
"第五章 老姑娘的家庭","CHAPTER V AN OLD MAID’S HOUSEHOLD"
"要完成对这户人家生活习惯的描写，还必须介绍陪伴在科尔蒙小姐和德斯蓬德神父身边的几位仆人——雅克兰、若赛特和厨娘玛丽埃特，是他们三位一直伺候着这位舅舅和外甥女。","To complete the picture of the internal habits and ways of this house, it is necessary to group around Mademoiselle Cormon and the Abbe de Sponde, Jacquelin, Josette, and Mariette, the cook, who employed themselves in providing for the comfort of uncle and niece."
"雅克兰是位四十岁的矮矮胖胖的男子汉，他的皮肤红润，棕色头发，脸像是布列塔尼水手，他已经为这家效劳了二十二年。他负责伺候吃饭，洗刷马匹，管理花园，给神父擦皮鞋，跑腿，砍柴，赶车，到普雷博戴给牲口拉燕麦、麦秆和干草。他晚上留在前厅照看，在那里睡得跟睡鼠一样。他爱上了若赛特，一个三十岁的女人。如果她嫁给他，科尔蒙小姐就会把她辞掉。因此这可怜的一对人把他们的工钱积攒起来，偷偷地相爱，等待并盼望着小姐早日成婚，就像犹太人等待弥赛亚一样。若赛特出生在阿郎松与莫尔塔涅之间的一个地方；她身材矮小而丰满，她的脸看上去像沾了泥的杏子，不过她不缺观察力和精明；据说她控制着她的女主人。若赛特和雅克兰相信会有结果的，他们极力将内心的满足感隐藏起来，正是这满足感让他们这对情人能指望着将来。厨娘玛丽埃特在主人家干活已有十五年了，她会做当地所有时兴的菜肴。","Jacquelin, a man of forty, short, fat, ruddy, and brown, with a face like a Breton sailor, had been in the service of the house for twenty-two years.He waited at table, groomed the mare, gardened, blacked the abbe’s boots, went on errands, chopped the wood, drove the carriole, and fetched the oats, straw, and hay from Prebaudet.He sat in the antechamber during the evening, where he slept like a dormouse.He was in love with Josette, a girl of thirty, whom Mademoiselle would have dismissed had she married him.So the poor fond pair laid by their wages, and loved each other silently, waiting, hoping for mademoiselle’s own marriage, as the Jews are waiting for the Messiah.Josette, born between Alencon and Mortagne, was short and plump; her face, which looked like a dirty apricot, was not wanting in sense and character; it was said that she ruled her mistress.Josette and Jacquelin, sure of results, endeavored to hide an inward satisfaction which allows it to be supposed that, as lovers, they had discounted the future.Mariette, the cook, who had been fifteen years in the household, knew how to make all the dishes held in most honor in Alencon."
"也许我们在对这户人家的介绍中，还要算上那匹拉着科尔蒙小姐到普雷博戴田庄上去的又肥又老的诺曼底枣红色马，因为这家的五位成员对这牲口都疼爱至极。这匹马名叫珀涅罗珀，在这家服务了十八年了，并被精心照管着，有人按时给它喂料，雅克兰和家中小姐都希望它能再用个十几年。这匹马是科尔蒙小姐永久的谈资和关心的对象，可怜的她没有孩子来寄托自己的母爱，就把这些感情都转移到这个幸运的牲口上了。","Perhaps we ought to count for much the fat old Norman brown-bay mare, which drew Mademoiselle Cormon to her country-seat at Prebaudet; for the five inhabitants of the house bore to this animal a maniacal affection.She was called Penelope, and had served the family for eighteen years; but she was kept so carefully and fed with such regularity that mademoiselle and Jacquelin both hoped to use her for ten years longer.This beast was the subject of perpetual talk and occupation; it seemed as if poor Mademoiselle Cormon, having no children on whom her repressed motherly feelings could expend themselves, had turned those sentiments wholly on this most fortunate animal."
"这四个忠仆——珀涅罗珀的聪明智慧已将自己提升到了另外几位善良仆人的水平，而他们却下降到牲口一般默默无言、唯命是从的状态——每天你来我往，始终坚持分毫不差地干着同样的活。不过，正像他们自己说的那样，他们是先甜后苦。像所有被一个固定的念头折磨的人一样，科尔蒙小姐变得挑剔起来，而且唠唠叨叨。这倒不是因为性格使然，而是因为她想找事情打发时间。因为她没有丈夫和孩子可照顾，便求助于无聊琐事。仅仅是橱柜里一打编号为“Z”的餐巾放在编号为“O”的餐巾前面这样的小事，她都能唠叨上好几个小时。","The four faithful servants—for Penelope’s intelligence raised her to the level of the other good servants; while they, on the other hand, had lowered themselves to the mute, submissive regularity of the beast—went and came daily in the same occupations with the infallible accuracy of mechanism.But, as they said in their idiom, they had eaten their white bread first.Mademoiselle Cormon, like all persons nervously agitated by a fixed idea, became hard to please, and nagging, less by nature than from the need of employing her activity.Having no husband or children to occupy her, she fell back on petty details.She talked for hours about mere nothings, on a dozen napkins marked “Z,” placed in the closet before the “O’s.”"
"“若赛特都在想些什么呀？”她大喊道，“她现在越来越马虎了。”就因一次雅克兰喂珀涅罗珀晚了点，科尔蒙小姐足足连续八天，每天追问珀涅罗珀是不是两点钟给马喂了燕麦。她那狭隘的想象力都耗在小事上了。什么地方鸡毛掸子漏掸了一层灰，玛丽埃特有一片面包没有烤好，若赛特没有及时拉上百叶窗导致太阳光照在家具上会让家具褪色等等，所有这些小事都会引来煞有介事的责备和埋怨，让小姐大发雷霆。“什么都不如从前了，”她会大叫道，“我都不了解自己的仆人了，事实上是我把他们给宠坏了！”有一次若赛特本应给她一本《复活节半月经》，却给她一本《基督徒的一日》。那天晚上，全城的人都听说了这件祸事。科尔蒙小姐不得不离开教堂回家一趟，她匆忙离去时还碰到了许多椅子，让人们认为出了什么大事。于是她得向朋友们一一解释这件事。","“What can Josette be thinking of?” she exclaimed.“Josette is beginning to neglect things.”Mademoiselle inquired for eight days running whether Penelope had had her oats at two o’clock, because on one occasion Jacquelin was a trifle late.Her narrow imagination spent itself on trifles.A layer of dust forgotten by the feather-duster, a slice of toast ill-made by Mariette, Josette’s delay in closing the blinds when the sun came round to fade the colors of the furniture,—all these great little things gave rise to serious quarrels in which mademoiselle grew angry.“Everything was changing,” she would cry; “she did not know her own servants; the fact was she spoiled them!”On one occasion Josette gave her the “Journee du Chretien” instead of the “Quinzaine de Paques.”The whole town heard of this disaster the same evening.Mademoiselle had been forced to leave the church and return home; and her sudden departure, upsetting the chairs, made people suppose a catastrophe had happened.She was therefore obliged to explain the facts to her friends."
"她语气温和地说：“若赛特，不要再发生这样的事了。”","“Josette,” she said gently, “such a thing must never happen again.”"
"科尔蒙小姐没有意识到，她在这些小小的挑剔埋怨中得到了快乐，这就相当于她苦难的发泄口。精神也有自己的需求，就像身体需要做体操一样。若赛特和雅克兰只有忍受她的反复无常的脾气，就像农民要忍受天气的变化一样。这三个善良的仆人会说：“今天天气很好”，或者“下雨了”，而其实并不是在说天气。并且，他们大清早的时候就会互相询问小姐早上起床的时候心情如何，就像农民通过黎明时分的薄雾判断天气一样。","Mademoiselle Cormon was, without being aware of it, made happier by such little quarrels, which served as cathartics to relieve her bitterness.The soul has its needs, and, like the body, its gymnastics.These uncertainties of temper were accepted by Josette and Jacquelin as changes in the weather are accepted by husbandmen.Those worthy souls remark, “It is fine to-day,” or “It rains,” without arraigning the heavens.And so when they met in the morning the servants would wonder in what humor mademoiselle would get up, just as a farmer wonders about the mists at dawn."
"最后，科尔蒙小姐自然还是在她的生活琐事中自顾自怜地度过每一天。她和上帝，听她忏悔的神父和每周要洗的衣物，她的蜜饯和教会的布道，还有她要照顾的舅舅，这些已占满了她那不发达的大脑。对她来说，她的生活已被夸大了，在天生便自私自利或因某些事成为自私自利的人眼中，生活的小事都成了大事。她很健康，可如果稍微有点消化不良，她就认为得了大病。她生活在我们祖先严格的医学教条之下，每年吃四剂预防药，药效强得足以让珀涅罗珀丧命了，却让这位小姐更显朝气。如果若赛特在给小姐穿衣的时候，发现小姐光滑如缎的肩膀上生了个小脓包，那将会让他们仔细回想前一周吃的各种食物。直到若赛特提醒她的女主人可能是吃了某一道会让人上火的兔子肉，这才长了那该死的脓包的，这是多大的成功啊！他们会兴高采烈地相互说道：“没错，没错，就是那兔子肉!”","Mademoiselle Cormon had ended, as it was natural she should end, in contemplating herself only in the infinite pettinesses of her life.Herself and God, her confessor and the weekly wash, her preserves and the church services, and her uncle to care for, absorbed her feeble intellect.To her the atoms of life were magnified by an optic peculiar to persons who are selfish by nature or self-absorbed by some accident.Her perfect health gave alarming meaning to the least little derangement of her digestive organs.She lived under the iron rod of the medical science of our forefathers, and took yearly four precautionary doses, strong enough to have killed Penelope, though they seemed to rejuvenate her mistress.If Josette, when dressing her, chanced to discover a little pimple on the still satiny shoulders of mademoiselle, it became the subject of endless inquiries as to the various alimentary articles of the preceding week.And what a triumph when Josette reminded her mistress of a certain hare that was rather “high,” and had doubtless raised that accursed pimple!With what joy they said to each other: “No doubt, no doubt, it WAS the hare!”"
"“玛丽埃特调料放得太重了，”小姐会说，“我总叫她给我和舅舅的菜做得清淡些，可她的记性还不如——”“那只兔子呢。”若赛特接话道。","“Mariette over-seasoned it,” said mademoiselle.“I am always telling her to do so lightly for my uncle and for me; but Mariette has no more memory than —”“The hare,” said Josette."
"“对，”小姐回答道，“她的记性还不如兔子呢，你说得很对。”","“Just so,” replied Mademoiselle; “she has no more memory than a hare,—a very just remark.”"
"一年四次，每个季节开始的时候，科尔蒙小姐会去她的普雷博戴田庄住些日子。现在已是五月中旬，正是她每年去看那里的苹果树“下雪”的时候——“下雪”是当地对树下落花这一情形的说法。当地上的落花像是一层白雪时，主人就可以盼着苹果酒大丰产了。科尔蒙小姐测量酒桶容积的时候，也注意到过了一冬后有些地方需要修补。她会命人来整理花园和果园，她餐桌上的食物就是从这里供应的。每个季节要做的事都不同。科尔蒙小姐动身前都会请她的密友们来聚餐告别，虽然三个星期后就又会和他们相见。科尔蒙小姐的出游总能成为阿郎松的重大新闻。她所有的常客，尤其是那些曾错过一次拜访的，都会前来与她告别。她家的沙龙宾客满堂，每个人都祝她一路平安，那感觉就像她要去加尔各答似的。第二天，商人们都会站在店门口看着那辆旧马车经过，并且挨家挨户地反复传递着一些消息：","Four times a year, at the beginning of each season, Mademoiselle Cormon went to pass a certain number of days on her estate of Prebaudet.It was now the middle of May, the period at which she wished to see how her apple-trees had “snowed,” a saying of that region which expressed the effect produced beneath the trees by the falling of their blossoms.When the circular deposit of these fallen petals resembled a layer of snow the owner of the trees might hope for an abundant supply of cider.While she thus gauged her vats, Mademoiselle Cormon also attended to the repairs which the winter necessitated; she ordered the digging of her flower-beds and her vegetable garden, from which she supplied her table.Every season had its own business.Mademoiselle always gave a dinner of farewell to her intimate friends the day before her departure, although she was certain to see them again within three weeks.It was always a piece of news which echoed through Alencon when Mademoiselle Cormon departed.All her visitors, especially those who had missed a visit, came to bid her good-bye; the salon was thronged, and every one said farewell as though she were starting for Calcutta.The next day the shopkeepers would stand at their doors to see the old carriole pass, and they seemed to be telling one another some news by repeating from shop to shop:—"
"“科尔蒙小姐这就去普雷博戴了！”","“So Mademoiselle Cormon is going to Prebaudet!”"
"有人说：“她的面包有人烤着呢。”","Some said: “HER bread is baked.”"
"“嘿，小伙子，”下一个人答道，“她可是个正派人。如果钱都到她这种人手里，我们这地方就看不见一个乞丐了。”","“Hey! my lad,” replied the next man.“She’s a worthy woman; if money always came into such hands we shouldn’t see a beggar in the country.”"
"另一个人说：“我说，如果葡萄园开花了，我可一点儿也不奇怪，科尔蒙小姐这不动身去普雷博戴了嘛。不过她怎么不结婚呢？”“我倒是愿意娶她，”一个人开玩笑说，“事实上，这婚事只成了一半，因为我愿意，人家还不愿意呢。算了！那烤炉是为迪布斯基耶先生加热的吧。”","Another said: “Dear me, I shouldn’t be surprised if the vineyards were in bloom; here’s Mademoiselle Cormon going to Prebaudet. How happens it she doesn’t marry?” “I’d marry her myself,” said a wag; “in fact, the marriage is half-made, for here’s one consenting party; but the other side won’t. Pooh! the oven is heating for Monsieur du Bousquier.”"
"“迪布斯基耶先生！哎呀，她已经拒绝他了！”那天晚上所有的聚会场合，大家都庄重地相互转告：“科尔蒙小姐走了。”或者：“你们就让科尔蒙小姐走了。”","“Monsieur du Bousquier! Why, she has refused him.”That evening at all the gatherings it was told gravely:—“Mademoiselle Cormon has gone.”Or: —“So you have really let Mademoiselle Cormon go.”"
"苏珊选择了一个星期三来公布她的丑闻，恰巧是科尔蒙小姐告别宴会的那天。那天科尔蒙小姐为了要带走衣物的事，把若赛特弄得头昏脑胀。就这样，城里发生了一件事，为这次告别集会增添了极大的趣味。正当科尔蒙小姐考虑要带什么东西出游之时，格朗松太太已经拜访了十几户人家，而精明的瓦卢瓦骑士正在阿尔芒德德埃斯格里尼翁小姐家玩皮克牌，这位小姐是显赫的埃斯格里尼翁老侯爵的妹妹，也是贵族沙龙的王后。任何一个人都会对此感兴趣，想知道引诱少女的家伙那天晚上表情会如何。不过对于骑士和格朗松太太来说，最重要的是知道科尔蒙小姐以她的双重身份——适婚女性和妇女协会主席——怎么来看待这个消息了。至于那无辜的迪布斯基耶，则正在林阴大道上散步呢。他开始怀疑自己被苏珊耍了，这个怀疑证实了他对女人的看法是正确的。","The Wednesday chosen by Suzanne to make known her scandal happened to be this farewell Wednesday,—a day on which Mademoiselle Cormon drove Josette distracted on the subject of packing.During the morning, therefore, things had been said and done in the town which lent the utmost interest to this farewell meeting.Madame Granson had gone the round of a dozen houses while the old maid was deliberating on the things she needed for the journey; and the malicious Chevalier de Valois was playing piquet with Mademoiselle Armande, sister of a distinguished old marquis, and the queen of the salon of the aristocrats.If it was not uninteresting to any one to see what figure the seducer would cut that evening, it was all important for the chevalier and Madame Granson to know how Mademoiselle Cormon would take the news in her double capacity of marriageable woman and president of the Maternity Society.As for the innocent du Bousquier, he was taking a walk on the promenade, and beginning to suspect that Suzanne had tricked him; this suspicion confirmed him in his principles as to women."
"在这大宴宾客的日子里，科尔蒙小姐家里三点半就已经摆好了桌子。那个时期，阿郎松的时尚之人都是四点开始用餐。帝国时期，他们还是像往昔一样下午两点半开宴，不过那时候他们还吃夜宵呢！科尔蒙小姐极力品味的快乐之一，就是看到自己穿戴成接待客人的女主人的样子，这时她会有一种无法形容的满足感（这种快乐倒没有什么恶意，虽然是建立在自尊自大的基础上的）。当她如此武装起来了以后，她的内心深处又会涌起一线希望：一个声音告诉她，造物主并没有白白地将她造就得这么丰满，会有一位敢作敢为、有事业心的男人出现。她的愿望像她洗过澡的身体一样变得格外清新，她怀着陶醉狂喜的心情欣赏自己魁梧健壮的身体，并带着这种满足感下楼到客厅、餐厅和小客厅，用她令人敬畏的眼睛审视着。然后，她会怀着富人那种认为自己将来会和现在一样永远应有尽有的天真的满足感，在周围走来走去。看着她的那些固定不变的家具、古董和漆器，她心中暗想，所有这些漂亮的东西都需要有一位男主人。她欣赏了饭厅和椭圆形的大桌子，上面铺着雪白的桌布，距离相等地摆着二十份餐具；她检查了她指定的大批酒瓶以及上面的名酒商标；她仔细检查了写在小纸片上的每一个名字，这是神父用他颤抖的手写成的，也是他在这家中所负责的唯一的事，同时负责对每一位客人坐在什么位置进行郑重其事的讨论。在检查完这一切后，科尔蒙小姐便身着盛装，去见她的舅父。此刻是一天当中最好的时光，她的舅舅正在台地上沿着亮河散步，同时还听着树丛中的鸟儿那无须担心猎人或孩子的袭击而尽情地啼叫。在这等待的时间里，她每次走到神父旁边都会问几个滑稽的问题，以便让这老人和她争论些什么，好让他开心。为了让大家明白这位心灵高尚的老姑娘的性格，我们还要知道这一点：","On gala days the table was laid at Mademoiselle Cormon’s about half-past three o’clock.At that period the fashionable people of Alencon dined at four.Under the Empire they still dined as in former times at half-past two; but then they supped!One of the pleasures which Mademoiselle Cormon valued most was (without meaning any malice, although the fact certainly rests on egotism) the unspeakable satisfaction she derived from seeing herself dressed as mistress of the house to receive her guests.When she was thus under arms a ray of hope would glide into the darkness of her heart; a voice told her that nature had not so abundantly provided for her in vain, and that some man, brave and enterprising, would surely present himself.Her desire was refreshed like her person; she contemplated herself in her heavy stuffs with a sort of intoxication, and this satisfaction continued when she descended the stairs to cast her redoubtable eye on the salon, the dinner-table, and the boudoir.She would then walk about with the naive contentment of the rich,—who remember at all moments that they are rich and will never want for anything.She looked at her eternal furniture, her curiosities, her lacquers, and said to herself that all these fine things wanted was a master.After admiring the dining-room, and the oblong dinner-table, on which was spread a snow-white cloth adorned with twenty covers placed at equal distances; after verifying the squadron of bottles she had ordered to be brought up, and which all bore honorable labels; after carefully verifying the names written on little bits of paper in the trembling handwriting of the abbe (the only duty he assumed in the household, and one which gave rise to grave discussions on the place of each guest),—after going through all these preliminary acts mademoiselle went, in her fine clothes, to her uncle, who was accustomed at this, the best hour in the day, to take his walk on the terrace which overlooked the Brillante, where he could listen to the warble of birds which were resting in the coppice, unafraid of either sportsmen or children.At such times of waiting she never joined the Abbe de Sponde without asking him some ridiculous question, in order to draw the old man into a discussion which might serve to amuse him.And her reason was this,—which will serve to complete our picture of this excellent woman’s nature:—"
"科尔蒙小姐认为说话是她的一项义务，倒不是说她话多，相反，她的思想很贫乏，她的词汇有限，讲不了几句话。但是她认为她是在完成宗教规定的一项社会义务，因为宗教教导我们要与人为善。这项义务对她来说是很难的事，她甚至专门咨询了她的神师库蒂里耶神父对于这个幼稚而诚实的礼仪问题的意见。尽管忏悔的人老老实实地向神父承认，她需要费尽心思来找话说，这位对宗教信条坚定不移的老神父，还是给她读了《圣弗朗索瓦·德萨勒传》中的一段。这一段讲的是交际场合妇女的义务和虔诚的女基督教徒应该怎样既对自己要求严格，又在家中显得和蔼可亲，而且还要使自己周围的人过得开心。因此，科尔蒙小姐对自己的义务深信不疑，并且愿意无论如何都顺从神师的教导，于是她努力制造愉快的对话。每次她看到对话冷场的时候，这可怜的姑娘穿着她的紧身衣直冒汗，想尽办法说些什么让对话再次热烈起来。往往这种时候，她都会发表一些最愚蠢的言论，比如“除了小鸟外，任何人都不能同时存在于两个地方”之类的话。有一天她成功地用这一句话挑起了关于传教的始祖所说“耶稣无所不在”的争论，不过她一点儿也听不懂。在谈话里的这一类成功让她赢得了“好心的科尔蒙小姐”的雅号。这个称呼从有头脑的人口中说出，意思其实是指她极其无知，甚至有点笨。但是有许多和她一样笨的人只能理解字面上的意思，并且回答道：","Mademoiselle Cormon regarded it as one of her duties to talk; not that she was talkative, for she had unfortunately too few ideas, and did not know enough phrases to converse readily.But she believed she was accomplishing one of the social duties enjoined by religion, which orders us to make ourselves agreeable to our neighbor.This obligation cost her so much that she consulted her director, the Abbe Couturier, upon the subject of this honest but puerile civility.In spite of the humble remark of his penitent, confessing the inward labor of her mind in finding anything to say, the old priest, rigid on the point of discipline, read her a passage from Saint-Francois de Sales on the duties of women in society, which dwelt on the decent gayety of pious Christian women, who were bound to reserve their sternness for themselves, and to be amiable and pleasing in their homes, and see that their neighbors enjoyed themselves.Thus, filled with a sense of duty, and wishing, at all costs, to obey her director, who bade her converse with amenity, the poor soul perspired in her corset when the talk around her languished, so much did she suffer from the effort of emitting ideas in order to revive it.Under such circumstances she would put forth the silliest statements, such as: “No one can be in two places at once—unless it is a little bird,” by which she one day roused, and not without success, a discussion on the ubiquity of the apostles, which she was unable to comprehend.Such efforts at conversation won her the appellation of “that good Mademoiselle Cormon,” which, from the lips of the beaux esprits of society, means that she was as ignorant as a carp, and rather a poor fool; but many persons of her own calibre took the remark in its literal sense, and answered:—"
"“是呀，是呀，科尔蒙小姐人真好！”","“Yes; oh yes! Mademoiselle Cormon is an excellent woman.”"
"有时，为了履行社会义务，向她的客人表示和蔼可亲，她会提些很荒谬的问题，惹得大家哄堂大笑。例如，她问，政府征了那么长时间的税，钱都派什么用场了；或是，既然《圣经》是摩西写的，为什么没有在耶稣基督的时代印出来。科尔蒙小姐的思想和英国的一位“乡绅”属于同一类。那英国乡绅总是听人在乡村议会上谈论什么后世、后代，于是有一天他站起来发表了一次演讲：“先生们，我在这里听了很多谈论后世、后代的话，我想知道这股力量为英国做了哪些事情？”后来这一演说变得非常有名。在这种场合，英雄般的德瓦卢瓦骑士只要看到了那些聪明人冷酷无情的微笑时，他就会用他全部机智的外交手段来解救这位老小姐。这位喜欢给予女人援助的老绅士，会似是而非地支持科尔蒙小姐的话，借此赋予她的话一些智慧。他通常掩护她撤退得非常好，以至于让人感觉那善良的小姐当时并没有说什么蠢话。有一晚她很郑重其事地承认她看不出阉牛和公牛之间有什么区别。这位可爱的骑士马上回答说，两者只存在羊与羊羔之间的区别，从而止住了大家的哄堂大笑。","Sometimes she would put such absurd questions (always for the purpose of fulfilling her duties to society, and making herself agreeable to her guests) that everybody burst out laughing.She asked, for instance, what the government did with the taxes they were always receiving; and why the Bible had not been printed in the days of Jesus Christ, inasmuch as it was written by Moses.Her mental powers were those of the English “country gentleman” who, hearing constant mention of “posterity” in the House of Commons, rose to make the speech that has since become celebrated: “Gentlemen,” he said, “I hear much talk in this place about Posterity. I should be glad to know what that power has ever done for England.”Under these circumstances the heroic Chevalier de Valois would bring to the succor of the old maid all the powers of his clever diplomacy, whenever he saw the pitiless smile of wiser heads.The old gentleman, who loved to assist women, turned Mademoiselle Cormon’s sayings into wit by sustaining them paradoxically, and he often covered the retreat so well that it seemed as if the good woman had said nothing silly.She asserted very seriously one evening that she did not see any difference between an ox and a bull.The dear chevalier instantly arrested the peals of laughter by asserting that there was only the difference between a sheep and a lamb."
"不过德瓦卢瓦骑士算是在为一位不懂感激的女人效劳，因为科尔蒙小姐永远也不明白骑士这些颇有风度的解围。看到谈话又热闹起来了，她还觉得自己并没有那么蠢呢。结果，她自鸣得意，完全失去了自知之明，不再胆怯，并且变得泰然自若，让她的话带有某种庄重严肃的味道，正如英国人庄重严肃地发表爱国的谬论一般——可以说是一种自命不凡的愚蠢。","But the Chevalier de Valois served an ungrateful dame, for never did Mademoiselle Cormon comprehend his chivalrous services.Observing that the conversation grew lively, she simply thought that she was not so stupid as she was,—the result being that she settled down into her ignorance with some complacency; she lost her timidity, and acquired a self-possession which gave to her “speeches” something of the solemnity with which the British enunciate their patriotic absurdities,—the self-conceit of stupidity, as it may be called."
"现在她一面迈着威严的步伐走到她的舅舅身边，一面反复思考着向他提个什么问题，好打破他的沉默。舅舅的默默无言总是让她困扰，因为她担心舅舅有些迟钝。","As she approached her uncle, on this occasion, with a majestic step, she was ruminating over a question that might draw him from a silence, which always troubled her, for she feared he was dull."
"“舅舅，如果说地上一切都是上帝的旨意，那么，任何事物的存在都有其道理了？”她挽住他的胳膊，靠在他身上说（这是她的幻想之一，她心里想道：“如果我有丈夫的话，我就要这样做。”）。","“Uncle,” she said, leaning on his arm and clinging to his side (this was one of her fictions; for she said to herself “If I had a husband I should do just so”),—“uncle, if everything here below happens according to the will of God, there must be a reason for everything.”"
"“那当然。”老神父一本正经地答道。这位好先生很疼爱他的侄女，总是怀着天使般的耐心任凭她打断自己的沉思。","“Certainly,” replied the abbe, gravely.The worthy man, who cherished his niece, always allowed her to tear him from his meditations with angelic patience."
"“那如果我一直当姑娘，假设是这样的话，也是上帝的旨意吗？”","“Then if I remain unmarried,—supposing that I do,—God wills it?”"
"“是的，我的孩子。”神父说道。","“Yes, my child,” replied the abbe."
"“然而，如果我选择无论什么也阻挡不了我明天结婚，可以说我的意志可以摧毁上帝的意志吗？”","“And yet, as nothing prevents me from marrying to-morrow if I choose, His will can be destroyed by mine?”"
"“如果我们知道上帝的真正旨意是什么，那有可能是真的。”这位前索邦修道院院长回答道。“要注意，我的女儿，你可是加了一个‘如果’哦。”","“That would be true if we knew what was really the will of God,” replied the former prior of the Sorbonne.“Observe, my daughter, that you put in an IF.”"
"这可怜的姑娘本来指望用这么一个强有力的论据将他舅舅引入婚姻的讨论中，结果听到这样的回答，她目瞪口呆了。不过，头脑迟钝的人总会按着孩子的可怕逻辑思考，从回答再转到问题，这样的逻辑总是让人为难。","The poor woman, who expected to draw her uncle into a matrimonial discussion by an argument ad omnipotentem, was stupefied; but persons of obtuse mind have the terrible logic of children, which consists in turning from answer to question,—a logic that is frequently embarrassing."
"“可是，舅舅，上帝创造了女人并不是要让他们一直当姑娘的；不然的话他们应该都一直不结婚，或者他们全都应该结婚。要是分配的角色不同，那就太不公平了。”“女儿呀，”善良的神父说道，“教会规定独身是接近上帝的最好方式，你这是在责怪教会了啊。”","“But, uncle, God did not make women intending them not to marry; otherwise they ought all to stay unmarried; if not, they ought all to marry. There’s great injustice in the distribution of parts.”“Daughter,” said the worthy abbe, “you are blaming the Church, which declares celibacy to be the better way to God.”"
"“但如果教会是对的，并且世上所有的人都是忠诚的天主教徒，那人类不是要绝种了吗，舅舅？”","“But if the Church is right, and all the world were good Catholics, wouldn’t the human race come to an end, uncle?”"
"“你想得太多了，罗丝，你想这么多是不会开心的。”","“You have too much mind, Rose; you don’t need so much to be happy.”"
"这样的话让这可怜的姑娘嘴角泛起满意的微笑，这说明她开始对自己形成的良好看法是对的。这个世界、我们的朋友和我们的敌人就是这样成为我们缺点的帮凶的！","That remark brought a smile of satisfaction to the lips of the poor woman, and confirmed her in the good opinion she was beginning to acquire about herself.That is how the world, our friends, and our enemies are the accomplices of our defects!"
"这时，客人陆续来到，他们的谈话因此打住了。在这样的大宴宾客的日子里，家中的仆人与应邀的客人之间也会相互问候。玛丽埃特见到法院院长走过厨房，于是说道：","At this moment the conversation was interrupted by the successive arrival of the guests.On these ceremonial days, friendly familiarities were exchanged between the servants of the house and the company.Mariette remarked to the chief-justice as he passed the kitchen:—"
"“哦，迪龙瑟雷先生，我特意为您准备了干酪丝烤菜花。我家小姐知道您特爱吃这道菜，并且对我说‘玛丽埃特，千万别忘了今天迪龙瑟雷先生会来。’”","“Ah, Monsieur du Ronceret, I’ve cooked the cauliflowers au gratin expressly for you, for mademoiselle knows how you like them; and she said to me: ‘Now don’t forget, Mariette, for Monsieur du Ronceret is coming.’”"
"“科尔蒙小姐真是太好了！”当地的法官放声说道，“玛丽埃特，你是把菜花浸在卤汁里而不是高汤里吧？这样味道会更浓。”法院院长才不愿走进玛丽埃特主持的议事室呢，他只是以美食家的眼光看了看，提供一点往日烹饪专家的意见而已。","“That good Mademoiselle Cormon!” ejaculated the chief legal authority of the town.“Mariette, did you steep them in gravy instead of soup-stock? it is much richer.”The chief-justice was not above entering the chamber of council where Mariette held court; he cast the eye of a gastronome around it, and offered the advice of a past master in cookery."
"“您好，太太，”若赛特对一直讨好小姐的格朗松太太说道，“我家小姐可想您啦，晚餐给您准备了一条鱼呢。”","“Good-day, madame,” said Josette to Madame Granson, who courted the maid.“Mademoiselle has thought of you, and there’s fish for dinner.”"
"至于德瓦卢瓦骑士，他则用大老爷的那种故意表示和蔼可亲的轻松语气对玛丽埃特说道：","As for the Chevalier de Valois, he remarked to Mariette, in the easy tone of a great seigneur who condescends to be familiar:—"
"“哎呀，亲爱的手艺高明的厨师，我真应该奖励你我这十字勋章！晚上有为我准备什么精致好菜吗？”","“Well, my dear cordon-bleu, to whom I should give the cross of the Legion of honor, is there some little dainty for which I had better reserve myself?”"
"“有的，有的，德瓦卢瓦先生！有一只从普雷博戴送来的兔子，足有十四磅重呢！”","“Yes, yes, Monsieur de Valois,—a hare sent from Prebaudet; weighs fourteen pounds.”"
"迪布斯基耶是不在邀请之列的。科尔蒙小姐一直坚持着我们都已知道的择偶原则，她总是以很怠慢的态度对待那位五十多岁的追求者。不过在内心，她对他总有一种难以解释的情感。她已经拒绝了他的求婚，可有时她又感到后悔，并且她有一种预感，觉得最后还是会嫁给他，因此她又感到害怕，以至于她不敢去想这桩婚事。这些想法让她对迪布斯基耶难以忘怀。虽然她没有意识到，但其实她深受这个赫尔克里斯式体型的共和党人的影响。虽然格朗松太太和德瓦卢瓦骑士不能理解科尔蒙小姐的自相矛盾，但是他们都见过小姐对迪布斯基耶天真地暗送秋波。其中的意思很明显，所以这两人都下决心要设法毁灭那已被拒绝的商人的希望——虽然他已遭拒绝，但很明显他还是不死心。","Du Bousquier was not invited.Mademoiselle Cormon, faithful to the system which we know of, treated that fifty-year-old suitor extremely ill, although she felt inexplicable sentiments towards him in the depths of her heart.She had refused him; yet at times she repented; and a presentiment that she should yet marry him, together with a terror at the idea which prevented her from wishing for the marriage, assailed her.Her mind, stimulated by these feelings, was much occupied by du Bousquier.Without being aware of it, she was influenced by the herculean form of the republican.Madame Granson and the Chevalier de Valois, although they could not explain to themselves Mademoiselle Cormon’s inconsistencies, had detected her naive glances in that direction, the meaning of which seemed clear enough to make them both resolve to ruin the hopes of the already rejected purveyor,—hopes which it was evident he still indulged."
"有两位客人迟到了，但是一说出他们的职务，人们就会原谅因为他们而没有按时开席了。一位是抵押物品保管人迪库德赖先生，另一位是德埃斯格里尼翁府上的前总管、高等贵族公证人舒瓦内尔先生。舒瓦内尔先生德高望重，高等贵族都是恭恭敬敬地接待他，他本人也是非常富有。当雅克兰见到这两位姗姗来迟的客人径直走向客厅时，对他们说道：","Two guests, whose functions excused them, kept the dinner waiting.One was Monsieur du Coudrai, the recorder of mortgages; the other Monsieur Choisnel, former bailiff to the house of Esgrignon, and now the notary of the upper aristocracy, by whom he was received with a distinction due to his virtues; he was also a man of considerable wealth.When the two belated guests arrived, Jacquelin said to them as he saw them about to enter the salon:—"
"“大家都在花园里呢。”","“THEY are all in the garden.”"
"这位抵押物品保管人是城里最没有缺点的人了，唯一的缺点就是为了钱财而娶了一个脾气特别大的老女人，加上他专爱说俏皮话，并且每次自己都是第一个笑出声的。毫无疑问大家的肚子都已经等得不耐烦了，一见到他来，人群中立即出现一阵轻轻的喧哗，迟到的人总是要受到这样的欢迎的。客人们在等待正式宣布开席的时候，都在亮河的台地上散步。他们一边看着水中镶嵌的水草，一边细细观赏着河流对岸成排的房屋。那里有着古老的木头长廊，窗台塌陷的窗户，晾衣服的小花园，细木工的作坊等等。总之，这些细致小景，加上倾斜的垂柳、朵朵鲜花、蔷薇丛，更加增添了一种意境之美，非常值得风景画家来这里作画。","No doubt the assembled stomachs were impatient; for on the appearance of the register of mortgages—who had no defect except that of having married for her money an intolerable old woman, and of perpetrating endless puns, at which he was the first to laugh—the gentle murmur by which such late-comers are welcomed arose.While awaiting the official announcement of dinner, the company were sauntering on the terrace above the river, and gazing at the water-plants, the mosaic of the currents, and the various pretty details of the houses clustering across the river, their old wooden galleries, their mouldering window-frames, their little gardens where clothes were drying, the cabinet-maker’s shop,—in short, the many details of a small community to which the vicinity of a river, a weeping willow, flowers, rose-bushes, added a certain grace, making the scene quite worthy of a landscape painter."
"骑士观察着所有人的表情，因为他知道他放出的火已经成功地蔓延到了当地的显赫人家中。但目前还没有人公开地谈论这件关于苏珊和迪布斯基耶的大新闻。外省人非常了解如何一点一点传开闲言闲语的艺术，现在还不是谈论这件奇闻的时候，得等到每一个人都想好了该如何评论之后才行。所以现在大家都只是在悄声细语地议论着：","The chevalier studied all faces, for he knew that his firebrand had been very successfully introduced into the chief houses of the place.But no one as yet referred openly to the great news of Suzanne and du Bousquier.Provincials possess in the highest degree the art of distilling gossip; the right moment for openly discussing this strange affair had not arrived; it was first necessary that all present should put themselves on record.So the whispers went round from ear to ear:—"
"“你听说了吗？”","“You have heard?”"
"“听说了。”","“Yes.”"
"“是指迪布斯基耶吗？”","“Du Bousquier?”"
"“还有那个漂亮的苏珊。”","“And that handsome Suzanne.”"
"“科尔蒙小姐知道这件事吗？”","“Does Mademoiselle Cormon know of it?”"
"“不知道。”","“No.”"
"“啊，是吧！”","“Ha!”"
"这是传播丑闻的钢琴曲，一旦撤走第一道正菜后，这渐强的高潮部分就要爆发出来。突然，德瓦卢瓦骑士注意到了格朗松太太，她今天戴着她的绿色的帽子，插了一束报春花，并且满面红光。难道只是这场“音乐会”开始的喜悦让她如此开心？尽管这样的消息对于生活如此单调的人来说，相当于一个要开发的金矿，但是善于观察和多疑的骑士似乎发现了这个老太婆更深一层的感情，那就是要赢得自身利益的喜悦。他立刻转头去研究阿塔纳斯，发现他正处于那种深度沉思的沉默中。不一会儿，那年轻人看了一眼科尔蒙小姐，骑士立刻了解了一切。这闪电的一瞬间让他弄明白了过去发生的种种。","This was the PIANO of the scandal; the RINFORZANDO would break forth as soon as the first course had been removed.Suddenly Monsieur de Valois’s eyes lighted on Madame Granson, arrayed in her green hat with bunches of auriculas, and beaming with evident joy.Was it merely the joy of opening the concert?Though such a piece of news was like a gold mine to work in the monotonous lives of these personages, the observant and distrustful chevalier thought he recognized in the worthy woman a far more extended sentiment; namely, the joy caused by the triumph of self-interest.Instantly he turned to examine Athanase, and detected him in the significant silence of deep meditation.Presently, a look cast by the young man on Mademoiselle Cormon carried to the soul of the chevalier a sudden gleam.That momentary flash of lightning enabled him to read the past."
"“啊,该死的！”他心中暗想，“我岂不是要被将军了！”","“Ha! the devil!” he said to himself; “what a checkmate I’m exposed to!”"
"德瓦卢瓦现在走到科尔蒙小姐跟前，让她搀着他的手臂走进饭厅。这老姑娘对骑士非常尊敬。他的姓氏和在贵族中所占的威望，让他成为她的沙龙中最耀眼的装饰品。科尔蒙小姐在过去的十二年间一直都向往着能成为德瓦卢瓦夫人。这个姓氏就像一个树干，在她的头脑里发散出关于自己要嫁的人的地位、高尚的品德以及种种外部优点。虽然骑士是她的心、她的思想、她的雄心所选中的人，但是这个头发梳得光溜溜的老朽总是看上去像圣约翰，让她有些担忧。她认为他是一位绅士没错，但是她没法把他看成丈夫。骑士总是表现出对婚姻无所谓的态度，特别是他居住在女工充斥的房屋里还能保有高尚的品德，这两点都严重影响了科尔蒙小姐对他的看法，与骑士的预期相悖。这位对自己的养老金问题把握得很准的先生，在这件事上可是失算了。科尔蒙小姐没有意识到自己对骑士先生的想法，但是可以用这句话来解释她是怎么看待这位中规中矩的先生的：","Monsieur de Valois now approached Mademoiselle Cormon, and offered his arm.The old maid’s feeling to the chevalier was that of respectful consideration; and certainly his name, together with the position he occupied among the aristocratic constellations of the department made him the most brilliant ornament of her salon.In her inmost mind Mademoiselle Cormon had wished for the last dozen years to become Madame de Valois.That name was like the branch of a tree, to which the ideas which SWARMED in her mind about rank, nobility, and the external qualities of a husband had fastened.But, though the Chevalier de Valois was the man chosen by her heart, and mind, and ambition, that elderly ruin, combed and curled like a little Saint-John in a procession, alarmed Mademoiselle Cormon.She saw the gentleman in him, but she could not see a husband.The indifference which the chevalier affected as to marriage, above all, the apparent purity of his morals in a house which abounded in grisettes, did singular harm in her mind to Monsieur de Valois against his expectations.The worthy man, who showed such judgment in the matter of his annuity, was at fault here.Without being herself aware of it, the thoughts of Mademoiselle Cormon on the too virtuous chevalier might be translated thus:—"
"“他要是能稍微放荡点就好了，真可惜！”","“What a pity that he isn’t a trifle dissipated!”"
"研究人类心理的人发现，虔诚的女教徒偏爱流氓之类的人；有人觉得很难理解，认为这是有悖基督教道德的。首先，要像木炭一样将恶习的浊水净化，对于一个品行端庄的妇女，你还能赋予她什么更圣洁的使命呢？一些擅于观察的人难道没有发现，这些高尚的女性所遵循的原则要求她们永远不能违背夫妻之间的忠诚，她们自然会向往一个实践经验比自己丰富的丈夫啊？这些社会的坏人往往是爱情方面的伟人。因此，可怜的老姑娘看见自己所选的花瓶碎成两半，悲叹不已。只有上帝才能将骑士和迪布斯基耶合二为一。","Observers of the human heart have remarked the leaning of pious women toward scamps; some have expressed surprise at this taste, considering it opposed to Christian virtue.But, in the first place, what nobler destiny can you offer to a virtuous woman than to purify, like charcoal, the muddy waters of vice?How is it some observers fail to see that these noble creatures, obliged by the sternness of their own principles never to infringe on conjugal fidelity, must naturally desire a husband of wider practical experience than their own?The scamps of social life are great men in love.Thus the poor woman groaned in spirit at finding her chosen vessel parted into two pieces.God alone could solder together a Chevalier de Valois and a du Bousquier."
"要让诸位了解骑士和科尔蒙小姐将要交谈的话的重要意义，还必须交代两件激动了全城人心的事。人们对这两件事意见分歧很大，而迪布斯基耶也神秘地卷入了这些事。","In order to explain the importance of the few words which the chevalier and Mademoiselle Cormon are about to say to each other, it is necessary to reveal two serious matters which agitated the town, and about which opinions were divided; besides, du Bousquier was mysteriously connected with them."
"一件是关于阿郎松的神父，他从前宣誓遵守《神父的公民组织法》，现在正通过大做好事来转变天主教徒对他的反感情绪。他是一个小小的谢弗吕，曾受到众人高度的尊敬，以至于他去世时，全城的人都为他哀悼。科尔蒙小姐和德斯蓬德神父属于极度正统的贵族小教会，它与罗马教堂的关系正如极端保王党忠心于路易十八一样。而且，神父尤其拒绝承认向宪法妥协的教会。这个神父已经得到阿郎松贵族教区圣莱奥纳尔教堂主持教师的好感，而科尔蒙家中却从未邀请过他。迪布斯基耶这个表面上支持保王党的人，实际上是个疯狂的自由党，他知道各反对派的依靠力量就是那些对现实不满的人（他们是最不受反对的），于是，他把这些对中产阶级有好感的人集中在这个神父周围。第一件事就是这样的，而第二件事是：","One concerns the rector of Alencon, who had formerly taken the constitutional oath, and who was now conquering the repugnance of the Catholics by a display of the highest virtues.He was Cheverus on a small scale, and became in time so fully appreciated that when he died the whole town mourned him.Mademoiselle Cormon and the Abbe de Sponde belonged to that “little Church,” sublime in its orthodoxy, which was to the court of Rome what the Ultras were to be to Louis XVIII. The abbe, more especially, refused to recognize a Church which had compromised with the constitutionals.The rector was therefore not received in the Cormon household, whose sympathies were all given to the curate of Saint-Leonard, the aristocratic parish of Alencon.Du Bousquier, that fanatic liberal now concealed under the skin of a royalist, knowing how necessary rallying points are to all discontents (which are really at the bottom of all oppositions), had drawn the sympathies of the middle classes around the rector.So much for the first case; the second was this:—"
"在迪布斯基耶的暗中鼓动下，阿郎松的人想要建一座剧院。支持迪布斯基耶的那些人并不了解他们的“穆罕默德”，但他们都认为要积极地支持这个计划。阿塔纳斯就是最狂热的戏院建造拥护者之一；最近，他在市长办公室里辩护，说年轻人都积极支持此事。","Under the secret inspiration of du Bousquier the idea of building a theatre had dawned on Alencon.The henchmen of the purveyor did not know their Mohammed; and they thought they were ardent in carrying out their own conception.Athanase Granson was one of the warmest partisans for the theatre; and of late he had urged at the mayor’s office a cause which all the other young clerks had eagerly adopted."
"这时，骑士正让老姑娘搀着自己的胳膊散步。老姑娘接受了这番好意，同时投以欣喜的目光以表谢意，而骑士借机用眼神指了指阿塔纳斯。","The chevalier, as we have said, offered his arm to the old maid for a turn on the terrace.She accepted it, not without thanking him by a happy look for this attention, to which the chevalier replied by motioning toward Athanase with a meaning eye."
"“小姐，”他开口说道，“您对于社会体统如此重视，而且您与那位年轻人有着某种亲戚关系——”","“Mademoiselle,” he began, “you have so much sense and judgment in social proprieties, and also, you are connected with that young man by certain ties—”"
"“只是远亲而已。”她打断他道。","“Distant ones,” she said, interrupting him."
"骑士接着说：“您难道不应该利用您对他母亲和他本人的影响来阻止他误入歧途吗？你知道的，他不是很虔诚地信教，并且他还支持那位神父。这还不算什么，更严重的是，他现在会不会一头栽进反对派，而丝毫不了解这对他的前途会有多大的影响呢？他正在积极地谋划修建剧院。在这件事上，他是上了那个伪共和党人迪布斯基耶的当了——”","“Ought you not,” he continued, “to use the influence you have over his mother and over himself by saving him from perdition?He is not very religious, as you know; indeed he approves of the rector; but that is not all; there is something far more serious; isn’t he throwing himself headlong into an opposition without considering what influence his present conduct may exert upon his future?He is working for the construction of a theatre.In this affair he is simply the dupe of that disguised republican du Bousquier—”"
"“天哪, 德瓦卢瓦先生，”她答道，“他母亲总是跟我说他很有头脑，可是他连两个词都说不出来，他在我面前总是沉默得像根柱子——”","“Good gracious! Monsieur de Valois,” she replied; “his mother is always telling me he has so much mind, and yet he can’t say two words; he stands planted before me as mum as a post—”"
"“他根本什么都不想！” 抵押品总管高声喊道，“我无意听到了你说的话。向德瓦卢瓦先生致意了。”他补上一句，同时夸张地一鞠躬。","“Which doesn’t think at all!” cried the recorder of mortgages.“I caught your words on the fly.I present my compliments to Monsieur de Valois,” he added, bowing to that gentleman with much emphasis."
"骑士拘谨地还了对方一个礼，然后带着科尔蒙小姐走向更远的几盆花，以向打断他们谈话的人表明他不希望被别人窃听。","The chevalier returned the salutation stiffly, and drew Mademoiselle Cormon toward some flower-pots at a little distance, in order to show the interrupter that he did not choose to be spied upon."
"他压低声音在科尔蒙小姐的耳旁说道，“那些在帝国时期的垃圾学院里培养出来的年轻人能有什么思想呢？只有高尚的情操和高雅的习俗才能产生伟大的思想和真爱。谁看一眼都能知道那可怜的小伙子会成为一个傻瓜，也许就这么悲惨地死去。看他是多么苍白和憔悴啊！”","“How is it possible,” he continued, lowering his voice, and leaning towards Mademoiselle Cormon’s ear, “that a young man brought up in those detestable lyceums should have ideas?Only sound morals and noble habits will ever produce great ideas and a true love.It is easy to see by a mere look at him that the poor lad is likely to be imbecile, and come, perhaps, to some sad end.See how pale and haggard he is!”"
"“他妈妈认为他工作太辛苦了，”老姑娘天真地答道，“他经常熬夜，干什么来着？哦，看书和写字！不知道是什么活非得让个年轻人在晚上写字？”","“His mother declares he works too hard,” replied the old maid, innocently.“He sits up late, and for what? reading books and writing!What business ought to require a young man to write at night?”"
"“这会让他精疲力尽的。”骑士接着说道，极力将老姑娘的思想引到他的用意上来，让她对这位年轻的爱慕者产生厌恶感。“这些帝国学院培养的学生的道德品行真是糟糕。”","“It exhausts him,” replied the chevalier, trying to bring the old maid’s thoughts back to the ground where he hoped to inspire her with horror for her youthful lover.“The morals of those Imperial lyceums are really shocking.”"
"“哦，是呀！”天真的小姐说道，“他们那时还让学生们顶着鼓游行呢。他们的老师都是没有宗教信仰的。并且还让那些可怜的孩子穿上制服，弄得像军队一样。不知道他们是怎么想的！”","“Oh, yes!” said the ingenuous creature.“They march the pupils about with drums at their head.The masters have no more religion than pagans.And they put the poor lads in uniform, as if they were troops.What ideas!”"
"“看看培养出什么样的人了吧！”骑士意指阿塔纳斯，接着说道，“在我那个时代，年轻人可不会不好意思去看一位漂亮小姐的。而至于他，他每次看见你的时候都垂下眼皮。这个年轻人真让我担忧，因为我是真的很关心他。告诉他不要像现在这样为剧院的事忙乎了，不要和波拿巴分子搅和在一起阴谋策划。当所有这些年轻人不再这么暴动般要求修建剧院的时候——我是根据宪章的同义词说暴动的——政府自然就会建造剧院了。另外，告诉他母亲，要严加管教他。”","“And behold the product!” said the chevalier, motioning to Athanase.“In my day, young men were not so shy of looking at a pretty woman.As for him, he drops his eyes whenever he sees you.That young man frightens me because I am really interested in him.Tell him not to intrigue with the Bonapartists, as he is now doing about that theatre.When all these petty folks cease to ask for it insurrectionally,—which to my mind is the synonym of constitutionally,—the government will build it.Besides which, tell his mother to keep an eye on him.”"
"“哦，我肯定他母亲会阻止他去见这些拿半薪的、可疑之人的。我会和他妈妈说的，”科尔蒙小姐说道，“要不他可能会丢了市长办公室的工作，那他们俩该靠什么过活呀？这真让我害怕。”","“Oh, I’m sure she will prevent him from seeing those half-pay, questionable people.I’ll talk to her,” said Mademoiselle Cormon, “for he might lose his place in the mayor’s office; and then what would he and his mother have to live on?It makes me shudder.”"
"正像德塔莱朗先生谈起自己的妻子时那样，骑士看着科尔蒙小姐也如是暗想道：","As Monsieur de Talleyrand said of his wife, so the chevalier said to himself, looking at Mademoiselle Cormon:—"
"“再也找不到这么蠢的女人了!","“Find me another as stupid!"
"上帝呀! 没有智的德难道不是坏事吗？但是对于我这个年纪的人来说，她是多么可爱的妻子呀！她这么有原则！又是这么无知！”大家要知道他是一边取鼻烟，一边对着戈里扎公主暗自念叨着这段独白的。","Good powers! isn’t virtue which drives out intellect vice?But what an adorable wife for a man of my age!What principles! what ignorance!”Remember that this monologue, addressed to the Princess Goritza, was mentally uttered while he took a pinch of snuff."
"格朗松太太已经猜到了骑士是在谈阿塔纳斯。科尔蒙小姐正摆出尊严十足的姿态向那位年轻人走去，格朗松太太急于想知道谈话的结果，于是便跟了上去。而这时雅克兰来宣布晚餐已准备好了。老姑娘用眼神召唤骑士过去。对女性极为殷勤的抵押品总保管，从骑士刚才的举止中看出了外省贵族与资产阶级之间的隔阂。看到科尔蒙小姐召唤的眼神，他设法抢在老骑士的前面。他靠近科尔蒙小姐，迅速地向她挽起手臂递过去，科尔蒙小姐只好接过来。于是骑士计上心来，快步向格朗松太太走去。","Madame Granson had divined that the chevalier was talking about Athanase.Eager to know the result of the conversation, she followed Mademoiselle Cormon, who was now approaching the young man with much dignity.But at this moment Jacquelin appeared to announce that mademoiselle was served.The old maid gave a glance of appeal to the chevalier; but the gallant recorder of mortgages, who was beginning to see in the manners of that gentleman the barrier which the provincial nobles were setting up about this time between themselves and the bourgeoisie, made the most of his chance to cut out Monsieur de Valois.He was close to Mademoiselle Cormon, and promptly offered his arm, which she found herself compelled to accept.The chevalier then darted, out of policy, upon Madame Granson."
"“亲爱的太太，”他对她说道，故意走在所有宾客后面，“科尔蒙小姐对您亲爱的儿子十分关切，但是我恐怕由于他自己的过错，这种关切会消散。他不信宗教又是自由党；而且为了剧院的事，他频繁与波拿巴分子来往；他支持那位拥护《教士的公民组织法》的神父。这种种行为都会让他丢掉市长办公室的职位。你知道政府现在是怎么样精心除掉这些异类派的。如果您那亲爱的阿塔纳斯一旦被辞退，他还能找到什么工作？我奉劝他可千万不要让政府对他有不好的看法呀。”","“Mademoiselle Cormon, my dear lady,” he said to her, walking slowly after all the other guests, “feels the liveliest interest in your dear Athanase; but I fear it will vanish through his own fault.He is irreligious and liberal; he is agitating this matter of the theatre; he frequents the Bonapartists; he takes the side of that rector.Such conduct may make him lose his place in the mayor’s office.You know with what care the government is beginning to weed out such opinions.If your dear Athanase loses his place, where can he find other employment?I advise him not to get himself in bad odor with the administration.”"
"“骑士先生，”这位可怜的被吓坏了的母亲说道，“我真不知道该怎么感谢您！您说得对，我儿子被一帮坏人利用了，我得去开导他。”","“Monsieur le Chevalier,” said the poor frightened mother, “how grateful I am to you!You are right: my son is the tool of a bad set of people; I shall enlighten him.”"
"骑士早就看透了阿塔纳斯的本性，从他身上看出了那种共和主义信念的不驯因素。像他这样的年轻人，是愿意为了“自由”二字而牺牲一切的。“自由”这个词，定义不明确，也很少人理解，但是对于受命运鄙视的人来说，它就是反抗的旗帜；对于他们，反抗就是复仇。阿塔纳斯应该会坚持他的信仰，因为他的观点是与他艺术家的痛苦编织在一起的，也是与他对社会状况的辛酸观察交织在一起的。他不明白，三十六岁是一个人开始对人事、社会关系以及利益关系有所判断的人世阶段，他需要修正他原有的准备为之牺牲一切的观点，因为每一个真正才智过人的人都会做这样的改变。如果他仍然忠于阿郎松的左派，那他就等于自讨科尔蒙小姐的厌恶。骑士对于这一点的确看得很准。","The chevalier had long since fathomed the nature of Athanase, and recognized in it that unyielding element of republican convictions to which in his youth a young man is willing to sacrifice everything, carried away by the word “liberty,” so ill-defined and so little understood, but which to persons disdained by fate is a banner of revolt; and to such, revolt is vengeance.Athanase would certainly persist in that faith, for his opinions were woven in with his artistic sorrows, with his bitter contemplation of the social state.He was ignorant of the fact that at thirty-six years of age,—the period of life when a man has judged men and social interests and relations,—the opinions for which he was ready to sacrifice his future would be modified in him, as they are in all men of real superiority.To remain faithful to the Left side of Alencon was to gain the aversion of Mademoiselle Cormon.There, indeed, the chevalier saw true."
"因此这个表面看似平静的社会，其实和任何外交圈一样动荡不安；在外交圈内，计谋、能力、激情围绕着一个王国最重要的问题。现在桌上已经摆好了第一道菜，客人们纷纷就座。在这里他们都是按照外省的吃饭方式，不会因为胃口大开而不好意思。在巴黎则不然，就连动嘴咀嚼似乎都受到禁止奢侈的法律限制，这些法律要求推翻解剖学的规律。在巴黎，人们都是用牙尖吃饭，并且要掩饰好胃口。而在外省，一切都很自然，可能也有点太过于集中在“吃”之上了，而这也是上帝规定万物得以生存的普遍而伟大的方式。","Thus we see that this society, so peaceful in appearance, was internally as agitated as any diplomatic circle, where craft, ability, and passions group themselves around the grave questions of an empire.The guests were now seated at the table laden with the first course, which they ate as provincials eat, without shame at possessing a good appetite, and not as in Paris, where it seems as if jaws gnashed under sumptuary laws, which made it their business to contradict the laws of anatomy.In Paris people eat with their teeth, and trifle with their pleasure; in the provinces things are done naturally, and interest is perhaps rather too much concentrated on the grand and universal means of existence to which God has condemned his creatures."
"第一道菜快要吃完的时候，科尔蒙小姐说出了她最精彩的“演讲”，以至于之后人们谈论了足足两年，在阿郎松小资产阶级聚会上，只要提到她的婚姻，大家就会说起这件事。","It was at the end of the first course that Mademoiselle Cormon made the most celebrated of her “speeches”; it was talked about for fully two years, and is still told at the gatherings of the lesser bourgeoisie whenever the topic of her marriage comes up."
"等上倒数第二道主菜的时候，谈话内容自然而然地又提到剧院的事和那位宣誓拥护《教士的公民组织法》的神父。在一八一六年保王主义处于首次狂热时，人们后来称之为当地的“耶稣会会士”的那些人，都想将弗朗索瓦神父逐出他的教区。德瓦卢瓦骑士怀疑迪布斯基耶给这个神父撑腰，并且怀疑他是剧院事件的幕后策划者。其实，精明的骑士凭着他惯有的精明，就算背着迪布斯基耶，也能给他加上很多罪名，而迪布斯基耶是个没有律师为之辩护的被告。阿塔纳斯是唯一比较直爽能够支持迪布斯基耶的人，但在阿郎松有权有势的人物面前，他又没有勇气发表意见，虽然他内心认为他们很愚蠢。现在只有外省的年轻人还对上了年纪的人保持谦恭的态度，既不敢指责他们，也不敢和他们唱反调。在享用味道极其鲜美的流着油的橄榄鸭时，大家都顾不上谈话了。虽然科尔蒙小姐也赶紧尝上几口鸭子，但是她还是想先替迪布斯基耶说些好话，因为大家都把他说成专门煽动阴谋诡计的恶人，说他什么坏事都做得出来。","The conversation, becoming lively as the penultimate entree was reached, had turned naturally on the affair of the theatre and the constitutionally sworn rector.In the first fervor of royalty, during the year 1816, those who later were called Jesuits were all for the expulsion of the Abbe Francois from his parish.Du Bousquier, suspected by Monsieur de Valois of sustaining the priest and being at the bottom of the theatre intrigues, and on whose back the adroit chevalier would in any case have put those sins with his customary cleverness, was in the dock with no lawyer to defend him.Athanase, the only guest loyal enough to stand by du Bousquier, had not the nerve to emit his ideas in the presence of those potentates of Alencon, whom in his heart he thought stupid.None but provincial youths now retain a respectful demeanor before men of a certain age, and dare neither to censure nor contradict them.The talk, diminished under the effect of certain delicious ducks dressed with olives, was falling flat.Mademoiselle Cormon, feeling the necessity of maintaining it against her own ducks, attempted to defend du Bousquier, who was being represented as a pernicious fomenter of intrigues, capable of any trickery."
"她说道：“至于我，我倒认为迪布斯基耶先生只不过是搞些小孩子的名堂罢了。”","“As for me,” she said, “I thought that Monsieur du Bousquier cared chiefly for childish things.”"
"在当时的气氛中，这句话产生了极大的效果。科尔蒙小姐获得了辉煌的胜利，她让戈里扎公主掉了下来，鼻子撞到了桌子上。骑士怎么也料不到他的杜尔西内亚冒出来这么一句机智的话，他惊呆了，竟然一下子想不出赞扬的语句；他无声地鼓起掌来，就像人们在看歌剧时鼓掌那样，用他的手指尖做出鼓掌的样子。","Under existing circumstances the remark had enormous success.Mademoiselle Cormon obtained a great triumph; she brought the nose of the Princess Goritza flat on the table.The chevalier, who little expected such an apt remark from his Dulcinea, was so amazed that he could at first find no words to express his admiration; he applauded noiselessly, as they do at the Opera, tapping his fingers together to imitate applause."
"“她真是机灵得可爱呀，”他对格朗松太太说，""我就说她总有一天会摘下她的假面具的。”","“She is adorably witty,” he said to Madame Granson.“I always said that some day she would unmask her batteries.”"
"“私下里她总是很可爱。”寡妇回答道。","“In private she is always charming,” replied the widow."
"“私下里，夫人，所有的女人都很机灵。”骑士接着说道。","“In private, madame, all women have wit,” returned the chevalier."
"这场大笑终于平息下来，科尔蒙小姐问大家为什么这么笑。于是大家流言蜚语的拿手好戏开始了。有人说迪布斯基耶是个没有结过婚却有很多子女的纪戈涅爸爸，是个恶魔，过去十五年来是他维持着孤儿收容所。他的不道德生活终于揭露出来了！说他跟巴黎的那些钟情声色的家伙也相差无几，等等，等等。由德瓦卢瓦骑士这个声色乐队的最佳指挥带领，这一曲流言蜚语大汇集的康康序曲演奏得十分精彩。","The Homeric laugh thus raised having subsided, Mademoiselle Cormon asked the reason of her success.Then began the FORTE of the gossip.Du Bousquier was depicted as a species of celibate Pere Gigogne, a monster, who for the last fifteen years had kept the Foundling Hospital supplied.His immoral habits were at last revealed! These Parisian saturnalias were the result of them, etc., etc.Conducted by the Chevalier de Valois, a most able leader of an orchestra of this kind, the opening of the CANCAN was magnificent."
"“我真搞不懂，”他说，“一个迪布斯基耶这样的人怎么就不能娶一个叫苏珊小姐之类的人呢？她叫什么，你知道吗？叙泽特！虽然我在拉尔多太太家租房住，但我也只是知道这些小女孩长什么样而已。如果这个叙泽特是个身材高挑、活泼莽撞的姑娘，有着灰色的双眸、纤细的腰身和漂亮的小脚，我倒偶尔见过她。对于我来说，她的举止似乎很肆无忌惮，不过比迪布斯基耶的风度要好得多了。而且，这个姑娘很有贵族之美。从这点来看，嫁给迪布斯基耶，她还亏了呢，她可以有更好的选择。你们都知道，约瑟夫皇帝好奇地要到卢夫西恩去看杜巴里。他向她伸出手臂，要带着她散步。这个可怜的姑娘没想到能有这份荣幸，便犹豫着不敢挽皇帝的手臂。‘美人永远是皇后。’皇帝对她如是说。而你们知道，他还是个在奥地利出生的德国人呢，”骑士补上一句。“不过我可以说，德国，我们这儿都认为他们是乡巴佬，其实是一个有着非常高贵的骑士风度和对礼节十分讲究的国家，特别是靠近波兰和匈牙利的地方，在那里——”","“I really don’t know,” he said, “what should hinder a du Bousquier from marrying a Mademoiselle Suzanne What’s-her-name.What IS her name, do you know?Suzette!Though I have lodgings at Madame Lardot’s, I know her girls only by sight.If this Suzette is a tall, fine, saucy girl, with gray eyes, a slim waist, and a pretty foot, whom I have occasionally seen, and whose behavior always seemed to me extremely insolent, she is far superior in manners to du Bousquier.Besides, the girl has the nobility of beauty; from that point of view the marriage would be a poor one for her; she might do better.You know how the Emperor Joseph had the curiosity to see the du Barry at Luciennes.He offered her his arm to walk about, and the poor thing was so surprised at the honor that she hesitated to accept it. ‘Beauty is ever a queen,’ said the Emperor.And he, you know, was an Austrian-German,” added the chevalier.“But I can tell you that Germany, which is thought here very rustic, is a land of noble chivalry and fine manners, especially in Poland and Hungary, where—”"
"说到这骑士突然停下来，害怕别人会以为是在指他自己过去的艳福呢；他拿出鼻烟盒，将剩下的话留给那位三十六年多来一直对他微笑的公主了。","Here the chevalier stopped, fearing to slip into some allusion to his personal happiness; he took out his snuff-box, and confided the rest of his remarks to the princess, who had smiled upon him for thirty-six years and more."
"“这句话对路易十五来说，可真是太到位了！”迪龙瑟雷说道。","“That speech was rather a delicate one for Louis XV,” said du Ronceret."
"“但我认为是约瑟夫皇帝，而不是路易十五。”科尔蒙小姐以纠正的口吻说道。","“But it was, I think, the Emperor Joseph who made it, and not Louis XV,” remarked Mademoiselle Cormon, in a correcting tone."
"“小姐，”骑士注意到法院院长、公证人和抵押品总馆互换的狡黠的眼神，说道，“杜巴里夫人便是路易十五的苏珊，这是我们这些坏家伙都清楚的事，但是年轻姑娘并不适合知道。您不知道此事证明您是无瑕的白玉，历史上的腐败的事没有影响到您。”","“Mademoiselle,” said the chevalier, observing the malicious glance exchanged between the judge, the notary, and the recorder, “Madame du Barry was the Suzanne of Louis XV,—a circumstance well known to scamps like ourselves, but unsuitable for the knowledge of young ladies.Your ignorance proves you to be a flawless diamond; historical corruptions do not enter your mind.”"
"德斯蓬德神父亲切地看了看德瓦卢瓦骑士，点点头以示赞许。","The Abbe de Sponde looked graciously at the Chevalier de Valois, and nodded his head in sign of his laudatory approbation."
"“小姐难道不了解历史？”抵押品总保管问道。","“Doesn’t mademoiselle know history?” asked the recorder of mortgages."
"“你们把路易十五和苏珊混在一起，我怎么能了解你们的故事呢？”科尔蒙小姐天使般地回答道，很高兴看到橄榄鸭被吃光了，而且谈话也很热烈。在座的宾客听到她这句话，虽然嘴里满满的，但都忍不住哈哈大笑起来。","“If you mix up Louis XV and this girl Suzanne, how am I to know history?” replied Mademoiselle Cormon, angelically, glad to see that the dish of ducks was empty at last, and the conversation so ready to revive that all present laughed with their mouths full at her last remark."
"“可怜的小姑娘！”德斯蓬德神父说道，“慈善是一种神圣的爱，与不信教的人的爱情一样盲目。当不幸发生了，慈善就不应该再去考虑是什么原因造成的了。外甥女，你是妇女协会的主席，你们必须帮助那可怜的姑娘，她大概很难嫁人了。”","“Poor girl!” said the Abbe de Sponde.“When a great misfortune happens, charity, which is divine love, and as blind as pagan love, ought not to look into the causes of it.Niece, you are president of the Maternity Society; you must succor that poor girl, who will now find it difficult to marry.”"
"“可怜的孩子！”科尔蒙小姐感慨到。","“Poor child!” ejaculated Mademoiselle Cormon."
"“你们认为迪布斯基耶会娶她吗？”法院院长问。","“Do you suppose du Bousquier would marry her?” asked the judge."
"“如果他是一位正直的人，就应该娶她，”格朗松太太说道，“但是，坦白说，我家的狗都比他品格正派些呢——”","“If he is an honorable man he ought to do so,” said Madame Granson; “but really, to tell the truth, my dog has better morals than he—”"
"“不过阿佐尔确是一位大商人哦。”抵押品总保管以诙谐的语气说道。","“Azor is, however, a good purveyor,” said the recorder of mortgages, with the air of saying a witty thing."
"到了吃甜点的时候，人们还在谈论迪布斯基耶。几杯酒下肚，大家说的各种挖苦话更加刻薄些了。在抵押品总保管的带动下，大家你一句我一句地调侃起来。于是，迪布斯基耶就成了一个神父，但却不是自白者；他没有神父；他如神父般；他不是教士的神父，也还不是被征召的神父——","At dessert du Bousquier was still the topic of conversation, having given rise to various little jokes which the wine rendered sparkling.Following the example of the recorder, each guest capped his neighbor’s joke with another: Du Bousquier was a father, but not a confessor; he was father less; he was father LY; he was not a reverend father; nor yet a conscript-father—"
"“他也不能当养父。”德斯蓬德神父表情严肃地说道，止住了大家的笑声。","“Nor can he be a foster-father,” said the Abbe de Sponde, with a gravity which stopped the laughter."
"“也不是品德高尚的贵族老先生。”骑士接着说道。","“Nor a noble father,” added the chevalier."
"教会和贵族虽然还保持着他们的尊严，但也都玩起这样的文字游戏了。","The Church and the nobility descended thus into the arena of puns, without, however, losing their dignity."
"“嘘！”抵押品总保管说道，“我听到迪布斯基耶的靴子响了。”","“Hush!” exclaimed the recorder of mortgages.“I hear the creaking of du Bousquier’s boots.”"
"事情往往是这样的，一个人总是不知道自己背后的流言蜚语。也许全城都在议论他，在诽谤他，或是公开指责他，但如果他没有朋友，就会一无所知。现在这个无辜的迪布斯基耶就是超级无知。没有人告诉他苏珊已经透露了那件事，因此，他表现得非常自满，还有点自命不凡的样子；这时，大伙正离开饭厅，回到客厅准备喝咖啡；另外一些准备晚上打牌的客人也来了。科尔蒙小姐因为觉得羞耻，不敢抬眼看这个引诱少女的可恶家伙。她抓住了阿塔纳斯，开始对他说了一番关于保王政治和宗教道德的莫名其妙的陈词滥调。这个可怜的诗人不像德瓦卢瓦骑士一样有个装饰着公主肖像的鼻烟盒，以便忍受这番蠢话。他只有呆呆地听着他所爱慕的人讲话，同时盯着她那硕大的胸部，在他眼前的那上身是这完美身躯体积庞大的标志。他的情欲让他陶醉于这老姑娘的讲话中，她尖锐的嗓音变成了温柔的絮语，她乏味的言谈变成了机智的话语。爱情是一个假币制造者，不断地将铜币换成金币，而有时也将真的金币换成铜币。","It usually happens that a man is ignorant of rumors that are afloat about him.A whole town may be talking of his affairs; may calumniate and decry him, but if he has no good friends, he will know nothing about it.Now the innocent du Bousquier was superb in his ignorance.No one had told him as yet of Suzanne’s revelations; he therefore appeared very jaunty and slightly conceited when the company, leaving the dining-room, returned to the salon for their coffee; several other guests had meantime assembled for the evening.Mademoiselle Cormon, from a sense of shamefacedness, dared not look at the terrible seducer.She seized upon Athanase, and began to lecture him with the queerest platitudes about royalist politics and religious morality.Not possessing, like the Chevalier de Valois, a snuff-box adorned with a princess, by the help of which he could stand this torrent of silliness, the poor poet listened to the words of her whom he loved with a stupid air, gazing, meanwhile, at her enormous bust, which held itself before him in that still repose which is the attribute of all great masses.His love produced in him a sort of intoxication which changed the shrill voice of the old maid into a soft murmur, and her flat remarks into witty speeches.Love is a maker of false coin, continually changing copper pennies into gold-pieces, and sometimes turning its real gold into copper."
"“好了，阿塔纳斯，你能答应我吗？”","“Well, Athanase, will you promise me?”"
"这最后一句话，像是会惊醒我们的声音一样，击在这个正陶醉其中的年轻人的耳膜上。","This final sentence struck the ear of the absorbed young man like one of those noises which wake us with a bound."
"“什么，小姐？”","“What, mademoiselle?”"
"科尔蒙小姐突然站起来，同时看了迪布斯基耶一眼。那一刻，他酷似共和国硬币上那位神话中的胖天神。她朝格朗松太太走过去，在她耳边说：","Mademoiselle Cormon rose hastily, and looked at du Bousquier, who at that moment resembled the stout god of Fable which the Republic stamped upon her coins.She walked up to Madame Granson, and said in her ear:—"
"“我亲爱的朋友，你的儿子真是个傻瓜。那个学院糟蹋了他。”她补充道，同时想起德瓦卢瓦骑士反复强调过那种学校的教育非常糟糕。","“My dear friend, your son is an idiot.That lyceum has ruined him,” she added, remembering the insistence with which the chevalier had spoken of the evils of education in such schools."
"这真是晴天霹雳呀！可怜的阿塔纳斯还不知道，他刚才完全有机会用他自己火焰的余烬点燃老姑娘心中堆积的毛刷。他刚才要是仔细听了她说什么，当时当地他就能让这老姑娘了解他的激情，因为当时科尔蒙小姐正处于情绪激动之中，一句话就足够了。可是他当时正处于年轻人对真爱的愚蠢的陶醉中，错过了良机，就像一个充满生命力的孩子有时会因为无知而害死了自己。","What a catastrophe!Unknown to himself, the luckless Athanase had had an occasion to fling an ember of his own fire upon the pile of brush gathered in the heart of the old maid.Had he listened to her, he might have made her, then and there, perceive his passion; for, in the agitated state of Mademoiselle Cormon’s mind, a single word would have sufficed.But that stupid absorption in his own sentiments, which characterizes young and true love, had ruined him, as a child full of life sometimes kills itself out of ignorance."
"“你刚才对科尔蒙小姐说了什么？”格朗松太太问她的儿子。","“What have you been saying to Mademoiselle Cormon?” demanded his mother."
"“没说什么。”","“Nothing.”"
"“什么也没说，好吧，等下我会弄清楚。”她心中想道，把这件事推到明天再想，并且认为科尔蒙小姐刚才的话没什么大不了的。因为她认为经过那晚的讨论，迪布斯基耶在老姑娘心目中的形象已经完全毁了。","“Nothing; well, I can explain that,” she thought to herself, putting off till the next day all further reflection on the matter, and attaching but little importance to Mademoiselle Cormon’s words; for she fully believed that du Bousquier was forever lost in the old maid’s esteem after the revelation of that evening."
"不久，客厅的四张牌桌就坐满了十六位玩家。四位在玩皮克牌——皮克牌是一项花销很大的游戏，玩家往往要搭上许多钱。舒瓦内尔先生、检察官和另两位女士到小客厅里去玩西洋双陆棋了。多枝烛台上的蜡烛都已点燃，于是科尔蒙小姐的女伴们在壁炉前、沙发上和牌桌旁纷纷就座。每对新到的夫妇都问她：","Soon the four tables were filled with their sixteen players.Four persons were playing piquet,—an expensive game, at which the most money was lost.Monsieur Choisnel, the procureur-du-roi, and two ladies went into the boudoir for a game at backgammon.The glass lustres were lighted; and then the flower of Mademoiselle Cormon’s company gathered before the fireplace, on sofas, and around the tables, and each couple said to her as they arrived,—"
"“您明天就要去普雷博戴了吗？”","“So you are going to-morrow to Prebaudet?”"
"“是呀，我得去了。”她答道。","“Yes, I really must,” she replied."
"这种情况下，这房子的女主人就显得特别忙碌。格朗松太太是第一个发现这老姑娘的情绪有点反常的——科尔蒙小姐居然有心事！","On this occasion the mistress of the house appeared preoccupied.Madame Granson was the first to perceive the quite unnatural state of the old maid’s mind,—Mademoiselle Cormon was thinking!"
"“你在想什么呢，表妹？”等科尔蒙小姐在小客厅坐下后，格朗松太太终于有机会问她了。","“What are you thinking of, cousin?” she said at last, finding her seated in the boudoir."
"“我在想那个可怜的小姑娘呢，”她答道，“作为妇女协会的主席，我要你替我拿五十法郎给她。”","“I am thinking,” she replied, “of that poor girl.As the president of the Maternity Society, I will give you fifty francs for her.”"
"“五十法郎！”格朗松太太惊叹道，“你可从来没有捐过这么多钱呀！”","“Fifty francs!” cried Madame Granson.“But you have never given as much as that.”"
"“可是，我的好表姐，有孩子不是很自然的嘛。”","“But, my dear cousin, it is so natural to have children.”"
"这位老姑娘发自内心的不道德的话让妇女协会的司库目瞪口呆了。显然迪布斯基耶在科尔蒙小姐心中的形象更加高大起来了。","That immoral speech coming from the heart of the old maid staggered the treasurer of the Maternity Society.Du Bousquier had evidently advanced in the estimation of Mademoiselle Cormon."
"“说实在的，”格朗松太太说，“迪布斯基耶不仅是个恶棍，还是个流氓。一个男人做了这样的错事，他就应该赔偿全部的损失。要负责照顾这个小姑娘的，应该是他而不是我们吧？说实话，在我看来这个姑娘也不够正经，在阿郎松，比迪布斯基耶这个愤世嫉俗的家伙好的男人大有人在。这个女孩一定很放荡，才会去找他。”","“Upon my word,” said Madame Granson, “du Bousquier is not only a monster, he is a villain.When a man has done a wrong like that, he ought to pay the indemnity.Isn’t it his place rather than ours to look after the girl?—who, to tell you the truth, seems to me rather questionable; there are plenty of better men in Alencon than that cynic du Bousquier.A girl must be depraved, indeed, to go after him.”"
"“愤世嫉俗！亲爱的，你的儿子教了你一些完全不可理解的拉丁词。我当然不是要原谅迪布斯基耶先生。不过，请解释下，一个女人喜欢一个男人而不喜欢别的男人，怎么就说她是放荡的呢？”","“Cynic! Your son teaches you to talk Latin, my dear, which is wholly incomprehensible.Certainly I don’t wish to excuse Monsieur du Bousquier; but pray explain to me why a woman is depraved because she prefers one man to another.”"
"“亲爱的表妹，如果你嫁给我的儿子阿塔纳斯，那才是最自然不过的啦。他年轻英俊，前途无量，他将成为阿郎松的骄傲；尽管每个人都会针对你说些坏话：那些毒舌头会说各种各样的话，嫉妒的女人会谴责你堕落——但那又有什么要紧呢？你会得到爱，真正的爱。如果你觉得阿塔纳斯是傻瓜，亲爱的，那是因为他的思想太丰富了，物极必反嘛。他过的是十五岁少女般的生活；他完全没有染上巴黎的生活恶习，绝对没有！哎，换个话题吧，我那可怜的丈夫常这么说，迪布斯基耶和苏珊的关系也是如此。你可能会遭人诽谤，不过，迪布斯基耶这件事上，大家说的都是真的。难道你不懂我的意思吗？”","“My dear cousin, suppose you married my son Athanase; nothing could be more natural.He is young and handsome, full of promise, and he will be the glory of Alencon; and yet everybody will exclaim against you: evil tongues will say all sorts of things; jealous women will accuse you of depravity,—but what will that matter?you will be loved, and loved truly.If Athanase seemed to you an idiot, my dear, it is that he has too many ideas; extremes meet.He lives the life of a girl of fifteen; he has never wallowed in the impurities of Paris, not he!Well, change the terms, as my poor husband used to say; it is the same thing with du Bousquier in connection with Suzanne.YOU would be calumniated; but in the case of du Bousquier, the charge would be true.Don’t you understand me?”"
"“和你跟我讲希腊语一样不明白。”科尔蒙小姐眼睛睁得大大地说道，把自己的全部智慧都使出来了。","“No more than if you were talking Greek,” replied Mademoiselle Cormon, who opened her eyes wide, and strained all the forces of her intellect."
"“唉，表妹，如果我必须把话讲个明白，我就直说了，苏珊是不可能爱迪布斯基耶的。如果这件事上，没有一点儿真心——”","“Well, cousin, if I must dot all the i’s, it is impossible for Suzanne to love du Bousquier.And if the heart counts for nothing in this affair—”"
"“但是，表姐，如果人们不用心爱，那该怎么爱呢？”","“But, cousin, what do people love with if not their hearts?”"
"格朗松太太听到这里，不禁产生和骑士先前同样的想法：“我这可怜的表妹真是太天真了，愚蠢得让人受不了！——亲爱的”，她接着大声说道，“我认为孩子不单是靠想出来的。”“怎么不是，亲爱的，圣母玛利亚她——”","Here Madame Granson said to herself, as the chevalier had previously thought: “My poor cousin is altogether too innocent; such stupidity passes all bounds! —Dear child,” she continued aloud, “it seems to me that children are not conceived by the spirit only.”“Why, yes, my dear; the Holy Virgin herself—”"
"“但是，亲爱的，迪布斯基耶不是圣灵啊！”","“But, my love, du Bousquier isn’t the Holy Ghost!”"
"“没错，”老姑娘说，”他是一个男人！这个男人的行为使他自己成了一个相当危险的人物，以至于他的朋友们都建议他得结婚。”“表妹，你自己就可以带来那样的结果呀。”","“True,” said the old maid; “he is a man! —a man whose personal appearance makes him dangerous enough for his friends to advise him to marry.”“You could yourself bring about that result, cousin.”"
"“怎么做呢？”老姑娘带着基督徒慈悲为怀的心情说道。","“How so?” said the old maid, with the meekness of Christian charity."
"“你可以不接待他，除非他结婚才行。在这种情况下，你应该凭着美德和宗教信仰来清楚地表现出作为表率的谴责。”","“By not receiving him in your house until he marries.You owe it to good morals and to religion to manifest under such circumstances an exemplary displeasure.”"
"“等我从普雷博戴回来，我们再谈吧，亲爱的格朗松太太。我还要咨询我舅舅和库蒂里耶神父的意见呢。”科尔蒙小姐说完便回到客厅，那里正是最热闹的时候。","“On my return from Prebaudet we will talk further of this, my dear Madame Granson.I will consult my uncle and the Abbe Couturier,” said Mademoiselle Cormon, returning to the salon, where the animation was now at its height."
"灯火辉煌，女人们穿得花枝招展，聚会的人语气庄重而且高贵，这一切都使科尔蒙小姐对她的这个小圈子骄傲不已。对许多人来说，在巴黎的最高级聚会里，也看不到比这更豪华的场面了吧。","The lights, the group of women in their best clothes, the solemn tone, the dignified air of the assembly, made Mademoiselle Cormon not a little proud of her company.To many persons nothing better could be seen in Paris in the highest society."
"这时，迪布斯基耶正和德瓦卢瓦骑士以及两位老妇人——迪库得赖夫人和迪龙瑟雷夫人——玩着惠斯特。他已成了大家好奇地默默观察的对象。有几位少妇走过来，借口看牌，实际上是在仔细地偷偷打量他，尽管她们做得不明显，但就这么定定地看着他，让迪布斯基耶这老光棍还以为他的穿着打扮有什么问题呢。","At this moment du Bousquier, who was playing whist with the chevalier and two old ladies,—Madame du Coudrai and Madame du Ronceret,—was the object of deep but silent curiosity.A few young women arrived, who, under pretext of watching the game, gazed fixedly at him in so singular a manner, though slyly, that the old bachelor began to think that there must be some deficiency in his toilet."
"“是不是我的假发戴歪了？”他暗想，感到很不自在，这是最让老光棍们担心的事了。","“Can my false front be crooked?” he asked himself, seized by one of those anxieties which beset old bachelors."
"在第七局结束他输了的时候，他利用这个机会起身离开牌桌。","He took advantage of a lost trick, which ended a seventh rubber, to rise and leave the table."
"“我今天一碰牌就输，”他说，“显然运气很不好呀。”","“I can’t touch a card without losing,” he said.“I am decidedly too unlucky.”"
"“但是你在别的事上很走运呀。”骑士狡猾地瞟了他一眼。","“But you are lucky in other ways,” said the chevalier, giving him a sly look."
"这句话在客厅里不胫而走，大家都学着骑士的绝妙腔调，使得骑士相当于当地的塔莱朗亲王了。","That speech naturally made the rounds of the salon, where every one exclaimed on the exquisite taste of the chevalier, the Prince de Talleyrand of the province."
"“再也没有人有德瓦卢瓦骑士这样的机智了。”","“There’s no one like Monsieur de Valois for such wit.”"
"迪布斯基耶走到那《逃兵》画上的椭圆镜子前照了照，没发现他的外表有什么异样。","Du Bousquier went to look at himself in a little oblong mirror, placed above the “Deserter,” but he saw nothing strange in his appearance."
"同样的告别语，用了各种语调重复了无数遍后，客人们在将近十点钟的时候沿着长长的前厅纷纷离去。科尔蒙小姐将几位贵客送到台阶上告别。人们三五成群地离开了，有的沿着布列塔尼大路朝着城堡方向走去，有的朝萨尔特河的住宅区走去。于是，在阿郎松这条街上、在这个时间重复了二十年的对话，又开始了。还是一如既往的：","After innumerable repetitions of the same text, varied in all keys, the departure of the company took place about ten o’clock, through the long antechamber, Mademoiselle Cormon conducting certain of her favorite guests to the portico.There the groups parted; some followed the Bretagne road towards the chateau; the others went in the direction of the river Sarthe.Then began the usual conversation, which for twenty years had echoed at that hour through this particular street of Alencon.It was invariably:—"
"“科尔蒙小姐今晚看上去真好。”","“Mademoiselle Cormon looked very well to-night.”"
"“科尔蒙小姐？不会吧，我觉得她今晚很反常。”“那个可怜的神父身体越来越不行了！他一直在睡觉，你注意到了吗？他连他拿的什么牌都不知道；他真是很心不在焉呀。”","“Mademoiselle Cormon? why, I thought her rather strange.”“How that poor abbe fails!Did you notice that he slept?He does not know what cards he holds; he is getting very absent-minded.”"
"“他恐怕活不长了哦。”","“We shall soon have the grief of losing him.”"
"“今晚天气真好！明天天气肯定不错。”","“What a fine night!It will be a fine day to-morrow.”"
"“这种天气很适合苹果树开花呀。”","“Good weather for the apple-blossoms.”"
"“你赢了我们，但是你和德瓦卢瓦先生玩的时候，你可赢不了。”","“You beat us; but when you play with Monsieur de Valois you never do otherwise.”"
"“他赢了多少？”","“How much did he win?”"
"“嗯，今天晚上，大概三、四法郎吧。他从来不会输的。”","“Well, to-night, three or four francs; he never loses.”"
"“的确，难道你不知道一年有三百六十五天吗？这么算下来，他都能赢一座农场啦。”","“True; and don’t you know there are three hundred and sixty-five days a year?At that price his gains are the value of a farm.”"
"“哎呀！我们今晚输得真惨！”“先生，夫人，你们就到家了，多好呀！我们还要穿过半个城呢！”","“Ah! what hands we had to-night!”“Here you are at home, monsieur and madame, how lucky you are, while we have half the town to cross!”"
"“我可不同情你们；你们完全可以买一辆马车，免掉步行之劳呀。”","“I don’t pity you; you could afford a carriage, and dispense with the fatigue of going on foot.”"
"“哎呀，先生！我们有一个女儿要出嫁，这就耗掉了一个轮子，还有一个儿子在巴黎要我们供给，这就耗掉了另一个车轮了。”“你们还是要培养他当法官吗？”","“Ah, monsieur! We have a daughter to marry, which takes off one wheel, and the support of our son in Paris carries off another.”“You persist in making a magistrate of him?”"
"“年轻人还能学什么呢？而且，给国王效劳总没有什么可耻的。”","“What else can be done with a young man?Besides, there’s no shame in serving the king.”"
"有时大家会谈起苹果酒和亚麻，总是那些话，每年不同的时节在回家的路上谈的都是那个时节的内容。任何一个曾住在这条街上并善于观察人类风俗的人，只要他用心听听谈话的内容，就能知道现在是几月了。","Sometimes a discussion on ciders and flax, always couched in the same terms, and returning at the same time of year, was continued on the homeward way.If any observer of human customs had lived in this street, he would have known the months and seasons by simply overhearing the conversations."
"这时谈话的内容特别有趣；迪布斯基耶正独自走在人群的前面，哼着著名的“多情善感的女郎啊！你可听见小鸟在歌唱”的曲子，根本没想过合不合适。有些人认为，迪布斯基耶是个很能干的人，只是大家对他有误解。自从一个新的王政机构批准给他一个职位后，迪龙瑟雷院长就一直支持他。而其他的人则认为这个商人很危险，说他道德败坏，什么事都干得出来。在外省和在巴黎一样，惹人注目的人与艾迪生那则美妙寓言中的雕像一样：两个骑士从不同的方向看到这座雕像，便互相争论起来，一个说雕像是白的，一个说雕像是黑的，并因此动武。当他们都下马后才发现，这雕像一边是白的，一边是黑的。而到的第三个骑士说这雕像是红的。","On this occasion it was exclusively jocose; for du Bousquier, who chanced to march alone in front of the groups, was humming the well-known air,—little thinking of its appropriateness,—“Tender woman! hear the warble of the birds,” etc.To some, du Bousquier was a strong man and a misjudged man.Ever since he had been confirmed in his present office by a royal decree, Monsieur du Ronceret had been in favor of du Bousquier.To others the purveyor seemed dangerous,—a man of bad habits, capable of anything.In the provinces, as in Paris, men before the public eye are like that statue in the fine allegorical tale of Addison, for which two knights on arriving near it fought; for one saw it white, the other saw it black.Then, when they were both off their horses, they saw it was white one side and black the other.A third knight coming along declared it red."
"那晚骑士回家时，想了很多：","When the chevalier went home that night, he made many reflections, as follows:—"
"“现在是时候让大家开始谣传我要和科尔蒙小姐结婚了。这个消息得从德埃斯格里翁家的客厅传出去，然后传到赛镇的主教家里，通过代理主教们再传到圣莱奥纳尔教堂神父那里；神父一定会告诉库蒂里耶神父，这样的话，科尔蒙小姐就会受到一系列的影响。德埃斯格里尼翁老侯爵就会请德斯蓬德神父吃饭，以制止各种对科尔蒙小姐不利的流言（如果我决定拒绝她）或是对我不利的流言（如果她拒绝我的话）。神父很容易被打动，而科尔蒙小姐也不会反对阿芒德小姐登门拜访，这位小姐将告诉她这桩婚事是多么了不起，前程多么光明。斯蓬德神父的财产肯定有三十万法郎；她自己的积蓄应该也有二十多万法郎，并且她还有公馆、普雷博戴的地产以及一万五千法郎的固定收入。只要向我的朋友德方丹伯爵说上一句话，我就能当上阿郎松下一任的市长和议员。然后，一旦坐上右翼的板凳，我就能进入贵族院，高喊‘闭幕！’或者‘开始议题！’。”","“It is high time now to spread a rumor of my marriage with Mademoiselle Cormon.It will leak out from the d’Esgrignon salon, and go straight to the bishop at Seez, and so get round through the grand vicars to the curate of Saint-Leonard’s, who will be certain to tell it to the Abbe Couturier; and Mademoiselle Cormon will get the shot in her upper works.The old Marquis d’Esgrignon shall invite the Abbe de Sponde to dinner, so as to stop all gossip about Mademoiselle Cormon if I decide against her, or about me if she refuses me.The abbe shall be well cajoled; and Mademoiselle Cormon will certainly not hold out against a visit from Mademoiselle Armande, who will show her the grandeur and future chances of such an alliance.The abbe’s property is undoubtedly as much as three hundred thousand; her own savings must amount to more than two hundred thousand; she has her house and Prebaudet and fifteen thousand francs a year.A word to my friend the Comte de Fontaine, and I should be mayor of Alencon to-morrow, and deputy.Then, once seated on the Right benches, we shall reach the peerage, shouting, ‘Cloture!’‘Ordre!’”"
"格朗松太太一到家，便跟儿子激烈地争论了一番。她的儿子不能明白他的政见和爱情有什么关系。这还是头一回打破这贫寒家庭和睦气氛的争吵。","As soon as she reached home Madame Granson had a lively argument with her son, who could not be made to see the connection which existed between his love and his political opinions.It was the first quarrel that had ever troubled that poor household."
"第六章 最终的失望及其最初的影响","CHAPTER VI FINAL DISAPPOINTMENT AND ITS FIRST RESULT"
"第二天，科尔蒙小姐和若赛特坐上马车出发了。在包裹堆成的海洋上，她的身影就像一座金字塔。马车沿圣布莱兹街北行，到普雷博戴去。在普雷博戴发生了一件出人意料的事，加速了她的婚事。这件事，无论是格朗松太太、迪布斯基耶、德瓦卢瓦先生，还是科尔蒙小姐本人都无法预料。机遇是最伟大的艺术家。","The next day, Mademoiselle Cormon, packed into the old carriole with Josette, and looking like a pyramid on a vast sea of parcels, drove up the rue Saint-Blaise on her way to Prebaudet, where she was overtaken by an event which hurried on her marriage,—an event entirely unlooked for by either Madame Granson, du Bousquier, Monsieur de Valois, or Mademoiselle Cormon himself.Chance is the greatest of all artificers."
"到达普雷博戴的第二天，早上八点左右，科尔蒙小姐正一边吃着早饭，一边天真地忙着听取看守人和园丁的各种报告，这时雅克兰突然跑进饭厅。","The day after her arrival at Prebaudet, she was innocently employed, about eight o’clock in the morning, in listening, as she breakfasted, to the various reports of her keeper and her gardener, when Jacquelin made a violent irruption into the dining-room."
"“小姐，”他上气不接下气地喊道，“您舅父给您派了特急信使，是格罗莫尔老太太的儿子，带了一封信来。这小伙子天没亮就出发了，他刚到这儿，他简直像珀涅罗珀那样跑过来的！给他一杯酒喝吧？”","“Mademoiselle,” he cried, out of breath, “Monsieur l’abbe sends you an express, the son of Mere Grosmort, with a letter.The lad left Alencon before daylight, and he has just arrived; he ran like Penelope!Can’t I give him a glass of wine?”"
"“会是什么事呢，若赛特？不会是我舅舅——”","“What can have happened, Josette?Do you think my uncle can be—”"
"“如果是，那他就写不了信了。”若赛特猜到了女主人担心的事情，因而说道。","“He couldn’t write if he were,” said Josette, guessing her mistress’s fears."
"“快！快！”科尔蒙小姐看了头几行内容后便大喊起来。“叫雅克兰把珀涅罗珀套上！若赛特，快收拾下，半小时之内打包好。我们要赶紧回城——”","""Quick! quick!” cried Mademoiselle Cormon, as soon as she had read the first lines.“Tell Jacquelin to harness Penelope—Get ready, Josette; pack up everything in half an hour.We must go back to town—”"
"“雅克兰！”若赛特看着女主人的表情也着急地大喊道。","“Jacquelin!” called Josette, excited by the sentiment she saw on her mistress’s face."
"雅克兰听到若赛特喊后，走进来说道：","Jacquelin, informed by Josette, came in to say,—"
"“可是，小姐，珀涅罗珀在吃燕麦呢。”","“But, mademoiselle, Penelope is eating her oats.”"
"“那又有什么关系？我要马上走。”","“What does that signify?I must start at once.”"
"“可是，小姐，马上就要下雨了。”","“But, mademoiselle, it is going to rain.”"
"“那我们就淋雨吧。”","“Then we shall get wet.”"
"“家里着火了！”若赛特嘀咕着说，很郁闷女主人看完信后一言不发，却又反复地读。","“The house is on fire!” muttered Josette, piqued at the silence her mistress kept as to the contents of the letter, which she read and reread."
"“至少喝完咖啡吧，小姐；别那么着急，瞧您满脸通红的。”","“Finish your coffee, at any rate, mademoiselle; don’t excite your blood; just see how red you are.”"
"“我脸红了吗，若赛特？”她说着便去照镜子。镜子上的水银正往下掉，照出来她的样子怪怪的。","“Am I red, Josette?” she said, going to a mirror, from which the quicksilver was peeling, and which presented her features to her upside down."
"“天哪！”科尔蒙小姐心想，“我要是变丑了怎么办！来，若赛特，亲爱的，快帮我穿上衣服；我要在雅克兰把珀涅罗珀套好之前准备好。如果你来不及收拾好包裹，那就先留在这儿吧，我可不愿浪费一分钟的时间。”","“Good heavens!” thought Mademoiselle Cormon, “suppose I should look ugly!Come, Josette; come, my dear, dress me at once; I want to be ready before Jacquelin has harnessed Penelope.If you can’t pack my things in time, I will leave them here rather than lose a single minute.”"
"如果你能完全理解科尔蒙小姐想要结婚的欲望已经到了偏执狂的地步，你就能体会她的心情了。她的好舅舅通知她说，他最要好的一个朋友有个孙子，叫德特雷维尔，以前去当兵为俄国服务，现在想退伍后回到阿郎松居住。鉴于他祖父德特雷维尔男爵与神父之间的友情，希望神父能予以接待。这位老神父很紧张，要求外甥女立即返回，帮助他接待这位客人，以尽地主之谊。他收到的那封信已经迟了，德特雷维尔先生很可能当晚就会到达。","If you have thoroughly comprehended the positive monomania to which the desire of marriage had brought Mademoiselle Cormon, you will share her emotion.The worthy uncle announced in this sudden missive that Monsieur de Troisville, of the Russian army during the Emigration, grandson of one of his best friends, was desirous of retiring to Alencon, and asked his, the abbe’s hospitality, on the ground of his friendship for his grandfather, the Vicomte de Troisville.The old abbe, alarmed at the responsibility, entreated his niece to return instantly and help him to receive this guest, and do the honors of the house; for the viscount’s letter had been delayed, and he might descend upon his shoulders that very night."
"看完这封信后，科尔蒙小姐怎么还顾得上普雷博戴呢？看守人和园丁都亲眼看到科尔蒙小姐激动的样子，便站在一边等待她的吩咐。但是就在科尔蒙小姐要离开的时候，他们拦住她询问她的指示。这位在普雷博戴事事都要亲自过问的专横的老姑娘，居然第一次对他们说“你们看着办吧”，让他们目瞪口呆。要知道，这老姑娘平时对她果园的管理，细致到有多少个水果都要数得一清二楚，还要做上记号，以便按照每种水果的数目和情况来安排消费事宜！","After reading this missive could there be a question of the demands of Prebaudet?The keeper and the gardener, witnesses to Mademoiselle Cormon’s excitement, stood aside and awaited her orders.But when, as she was about to leave the room, they stopped her to ask for instructions, for the first time in her life the despotic old maid, who saw to everything at Prebaudet with her own eyes, said, to their stupefaction, “Do what you like.”This from a mistress who carried her administration to the point of counting her fruits, and marking them so as to order their consumption according to the number and condition of each!"
"“我是在做梦吧，”若赛特看见她的女主人像是上帝给装上了翅膀的大象一般飞快地跑下楼梯时，不禁想到。","“I believe I’m dreaming,” thought Josette, as she saw her mistress flying down the staircase like an elephant to which God has given wings."
"此刻，尽管下着大雨，科尔蒙小姐已经离开了普雷博戴，让她的下人自由处理各种事物。雅克兰可不敢擅自做主，驱使性情平和的珀涅罗珀比平时加快速度。这珀涅罗珀，生来就像她名字所代表的那位美丽王后一样，好像总是往前走几步，又往后退几步似的。科尔蒙小姐可受不了这速度了，用刺耳的声音命令雅克兰驾马快跑，必要的话，抽上几鞭子，这可吓到了这可怜的牲畜。科尔蒙小姐生怕没有时间安排好家中的一切来接待德特雷维尔先生。她算计着，舅舅朋友的孙子，大概就四十岁吧，是军人的话肯定还是单身。于是她决定，靠着舅舅的帮助，绝对不让德特雷维尔怎么走进家门，还怎么离开。科尔蒙小姐已经在想她的嫁妆和她的婚礼了。虽然珀涅罗珀在拼命奔跑，可是科尔蒙小姐还是不停地对雅克兰说，这马没有往前走。她在马车里坐立不安，顾不上回答若赛特的问话，自顾自地说着话，像是在考虑重大计划的人一样。","Presently, in spite of a driving rain, Mademoiselle Cormon drove away from Prebaudet, leaving her factotums with the reins on their necks.Jacquelin dared not take upon himself to hasten the usual little trot of the peaceable Penelope, who, like the beautiful queen whose name she bore, had an appearance of making as many steps backward as she made forward.Impatient with the pace, mademoiselle ordered Jacquelin in a sharp voice to drive at a gallop, with the whip, if necessary, to the great astonishment of the poor beast, so afraid was she of not having time to arrange the house suitably to receive Monsieur de Troisville.She calculated that the grandson of her uncle’s friend was probably about forty years of age; a soldier just from service was undoubtedly a bachelor; and she resolved, her uncle aiding, not to let Monsieur de Troisville quit their house in the condition he entered it.Though Penelope galloped, Mademoiselle Cormon, absorbed in thoughts of her trousseau and the wedding-day, declared again and again that Jacquelin made no way at all.She twisted about in the carriole without replying to Josette’s questions, and talked to herself like a person who is mentally revolving important designs."
"马车终于到了阿郎松的主干道上。从莫尔塔涅方向进城，这条街叫圣布莱兹街，到了摩尔旅馆附近的街叫赛镇门大街，而通向布列塔尼大马路上的这条街是羊圈街。科尔蒙小姐离开时惊动了整个阿郎松城，而现在可以想见，她刚在普雷博戴安下身的第二天就冒着大雨返回，在阿郎松又会激起怎样的喧嚣。大雨打在她的脸上，她也根本不在乎。每个人都注意到了珀涅罗珀的疾驰，雅克兰诡诈的笑，大清早的时间，乱七八糟的包裹，以及科尔蒙小姐迫不及待的神情。","The carriole at last arrived in the main street of Alencon, called the rue Saint-Blaise at the end toward Montagne, but near the hotel du More it takes the name of the rue de la Porte-de-Seez, and becomes the rue du Bercail as it enters the road to Brittany.If the departure of Mademoiselle Cormon made a great noise in Alencon, it is easy to imagine the uproar caused by her sudden return on the following day, in a pouring rain which beat her face without her apparently minding it.Penelope at a full gallop was observed by every one, and Jacquelin’s grin, the early hour, the parcels stuffed into the carriole topsy-turvy, and the evident impatience of Mademoiselle Cormon were all noted."
"特雷维尔家的房产位于阿郎松和莫尔塔涅之间。若赛特对这个家族的各个支系都很了解。在进入阿郎松城的时候，小姐透露的一句话让若赛特恍然大悟。于是主仆二人进行了讨论，确认要来的这个德特雷维尔大概是四十到四十二岁的单身贵族，家境不富也不穷。科尔蒙小姐现在似乎已看到自己成了德特雷维尔子爵夫人。","The property of the house of Troisville lay between Alencon and Mortagne.Josette knew the various branches of the family.A word dropped by mademoiselle as they entered Alencon had put Josette on the scent of the affair; and a discussion having started between them, it was settled that the expected de Troisville must be between forty and forty-two years of age, a bachelor, and neither rich nor poor.Mademoiselle Cormon beheld herself speedily Vicomtesse de Troisville."
"“我舅舅居然什么也不告诉我！什么也不考虑！什么也不打听！这就是我舅舅。要不是他的鼻子长在他的脸上，他大概连自己的鼻子都会忘了吧。”","“And to think that my uncle told me nothing! Thinks of nothing! Inquires nothing!That’s my uncle all over.He’d forget his own nose if it wasn’t fastened to his face.”"
"你注意到没有，在这种情形下，老姑娘像理查三世一样变得聪明、凶狠、大胆、轻诺寡信；或者也可以说，她像酒醉的教士一样，什么都不顾了。","Have you never remarked that, under circumstances such as these, old maids become, like Richard III, keen-witted, fierce, bold, promissory,—if one may so use the word,—and, like inebriate clerks, no longer in awe of anything?"
"很快，科尔蒙小姐突然回来这件事及相应的情形就从圣布莱兹街的街首一直传到赛镇门，传遍了整个阿郎松城，全程的公共活动和家庭活动都受到了影响。厨师、商贩和行人都纷纷挨家挨户传播着这条新闻，接着又传到了更高一级的地区。不久，“科尔蒙小姐回来了！”这句话就像炸弹一样轰动了各家各户。此刻，雅克兰正从马车前头他坐的木凳上下来（那木凳刨得非常光亮，恐怕连木匠都不知道是怎么弄成的）。他亲自打开绿色的大门。这门上部为圆形，举丧时一般闭着，因为科尔蒙小姐离开期间都没有举行过聚会。都是那些常客轮流在家设宴款待德斯蓬德神父。德瓦卢瓦先生还邀请神父到德埃斯格里尼翁侯爵家参加晚宴，算是还了人情。雅克兰打开大门后，亲切地呼唤珀涅罗珀进来，刚才他把珀泥罗珀停在马路中间。那牲口已经熟悉这程序了，于是自己动身进了大门，在院子里转圈，很小心地避免碰坏园中的花花草草。然后雅克兰拿起缰绳，把车赶到台阶前。","Immediately the town of Alencon, speedily informed from the farther end of the rue de Saint-Blaise to the gate of Seez of this precipitate return, accompanied by singular circumstances, was perturbed throughout its viscera, both public and domestic.Cooks, shopkeepers, street passengers, told the news from door to door; thence it rose to the upper regions.Soon the words “Mademoiselle Cormon has returned!” burst like a bombshell into all households.At that moment Jacquelin was descending from his wooden seat (polished by a process unknown to cabinet-makers), on which he perched in front of the carriole.He opened the great green gate, round at the top, and closed in sign of mourning; for during Mademoiselle Cormon’s absence the evening assemblies did not take place.The faithful invited the Abbe de Sponde to their several houses; and Monsieur de Valois paid his debt by inviting him to dine at the Marquis d’Esgrignon’s.Jacquelin, having opened the gate, called familiarly to Penelope, whom he had left in the middle of the street.That animal, accustomed to this proceeding, turned in of herself, and circled round the courtyard in a manner to avoid injuring the flower-bed.Jacquelin then took her bridle, and led the carriage to the portico."
"“玛丽埃特！”科尔蒙小姐喊道。","“Mariette!” cried Mademoiselle Cormon."
"“小姐！”玛丽埃特正在关门，回道。","“Mademoiselle!” exclaimed Mariette, who was occupied in closing the gate."
"“那位先生还没到吧？”","“Has the gentleman arrived?”"
"“没呢，小姐。”","“No, mademoiselle.”"
"“我舅舅在哪儿？”","“Where’s my uncle?”"
"“他上教堂去了，小姐。”","“He is at church, mademoiselle.”"
"雅克兰和若赛特这时站在第一层台阶上，伸出手，扶着车，好让女主人出来。女主人一边抓着车门帘，一边踩着车辕。然后，她撑着他们的手臂下了车。在车上的脚蹬是两个铁环，用一个由笨重的大螺钉构成的糟糕机关固定在车辕上。但是这两年来，由于她的体重，她再也不敢冒险踩那个脚蹬子了。","Jacquelin and Josette were by this time on the first step of the portico, holding out their hands to manoeuvre the exit of their mistress from the carriole as she pulled herself up by the sides of the vehicle and clung to the curtains.Mademoiselle then threw herself into their arms; because for the last two years she dared not risk her weight on the iron step, affixed to the frame of the carriage by a horrible mechanism of clumsy bolts."
"科尔蒙小姐站在台阶上后，满意地看了看她的庭院。","When Mademoiselle Cormon reached the level of the portico she looked about her courtyard with an air of satisfaction."
"“快来，快来，玛丽埃特，别管那大门了，我要你帮忙。”","“Come, come, Mariette, leave that gate alone; I want you.”"
"“家里要出大事了。”玛丽埃特经过马车时，雅克兰悄悄对她说道。","“There’s something in the wind,” whispered Jacquelin, as Mariette passed the carriole."
"“玛丽埃特，家里有什么吃的？”科尔蒙小姐像是累坏了一样一屁股坐在前厅的长凳上，问道。","“Mariette, what provisions have you in the house?” asked Mademoiselle Cormon, sitting down on the bench in the long antechamber like a person overcome with fatigue."
"“我还没做什么呢，”玛丽埃特两手叉腰地说道，“小姐您知道的，您不在的时候，神父先生总是在外面吃饭。我昨天才把他从阿芒德小姐家接回来。”","“I haven’t anything,” replied Mariette, with her hands on her hips.“Mademoiselle knows very well that during her absence Monsieur l’abbe dines out every day.Yesterday I went to fetch him from Mademoiselle Armande’s.”"
"“他现在在哪儿？”","“Where is he now?”"
"“神父先生吗？哎，在教堂呢，他要三点钟才会回来。”","“Monsieur l’abbe?Why, at church; he won’t be in before three o’clock.”"
"“他什么也不管！他应该叫你去市场的。玛丽埃特，快去吧。当然不要乱花钱，但也不要省着，去买些好吃的、精致的菜回来。去公共马车站那儿问问，看能不能弄到点肉糜，我还想要点儿亮河里的虾。现在几点了？”","""He thinks of nothing! He ought to have told you to go to market.Mariette, go at once; and without wasting money, don’t spare it; get all there is that is good and delicate.Go to the diligence office and see if you can send for pates; and I want shrimps from the Brillante.What o’clock is it?”"
"“差一刻九点。”","“A quarter to nine.”"
"“天哪，玛丽埃特，快别再唠唠叨叨呢。我舅舅说的那人说不定马上就到了。家里什么也没有，到时我们怎么给他做早饭呀？”","""Good heavens! Mariette, don’t stop to chatter.The person my uncle expects may arrive at any moment.If we had to give him breakfast, where should we be with nothing in the house?”"
"玛丽埃特朝浑身是汗的珀涅罗珀转过身去，看着雅克兰，似乎在说：“小姐这次总算要逮着一个丈夫了。”","Mariette turned back to Penelope in a lather, and looked at Jacquelin as if she would say, “Mademoiselle has put her hand on a husband THIS time.”"
"“现在，若赛特，”老姑娘接着说，“我们一起看看安排德特雷维尔先生在哪儿睡觉吧。”","“Now, Josette,” continued the old maid, “let us see where we had better put Monsieur de Troisville to sleep.”"
"老姑娘说这句话的时候真是感觉幸福呀——“安排德特雷维尔先生睡觉。”这句话里包含了多少想法呀!老姑娘沐浴在希望之中。","With what joy she said the words, “Put Monsieur de Troisville” (pronounced Treville) “to sleep.”How many ideas in those few words!The old maid was bathed in hope."
"“您想安排他睡在那个绿色的房间吗？”","“Will you put him in the green chamber?”"
"“主教的房间吗？不，那间离我的卧室太近了，”科尔蒙小姐说，“对主教阁下倒是很合适，他是一位圣人。”","“The bishop’s room?No; that’s too near mine,” said Mademoiselle Cormon.“All very well for monseigneur; he’s a saintly man.”"
"“那让他住在您舅舅的房间吧。”","“Give him your uncle’s room.”"
"“唉，里面太空了，没有什么家具，不大像样。”","“Oh, that’s so bare; it is actually indecent.”"
"“那么，小姐，让人在您的小客厅里摆一张床吧？也不麻烦，而且那里还有火炉。莫罗的店里肯定能找到一张与那间屋子的帷幔相称的床。”","“Well, then, mademoiselle, why not arrange a bed in your boudoir?It is easily done; and there’s a fire-place.Moreau can certainly find in his warerooms a bed to match the hangings.”"
"“很好，若赛特。你快到莫罗那儿去，跟他商量一下要做什么，需要什么你买就行。如果德特雷维尔先生到之前，莫罗能把床装好，或者他们同时到，但是莫罗可以不让德特雷维尔先生察觉而把床装好，我是愿意的。但如果莫罗不能保证，我就让德特雷维尔先生住在那间绿色的卧室里，虽然会离我的房间很近。”","“You are right, Josette.Go yourself to Moreau; consult with him what to do; I authorize you to get what is wanted.If the bed could be put up to-night without Monsieur de Troisville observing it (in case Monsieur de Troisville arrives while Moreau is here), I should like it.If Moreau won’t engage to do this, then I must put Monsieur de Troisville in the green room, although Monsieur de Troisville would be so very near to me.”"
"若赛特刚走没几步就又被女主人叫住了。","Josette was departing when her mistress recalled her."
"“等一下！把这件事向雅克兰解释清楚，”她紧张地大喊道，“让他到莫罗店里去，我还要换衣服呢！要是让德特雷维尔先生瞧见我这副模样就糟了！况且舅舅还没回来！","“Stop! Explain the matter to Jacquelin,” she cried, in a loud nervous tone.“Tell HIM to go to Moreau; I must be dressed!Fancy if Monsieur de Troisville surprised me as I am now! And my uncle not here to receive him!"
"啊呀，舅舅，舅舅！快来，若赛特，赶紧帮我换衣服吧。”","Oh, uncle, uncle!Come, Josette; come and dress me at once.”"
"“但是珀涅罗珀怎么办？”若赛特不假思索地问道。","“But Penelope?” said Josette, imprudently."
"“总是珀涅罗珀！珀涅罗珀这个，珀涅罗珀那个！珀涅罗珀是家中的女主人吗？”","“Always Penelope!Penelope this, Penelope that!Is Penelope the mistress of this house?”"
"“但她全身是汗呢，而且她还没有时间吃燕麦。”","“But she is all of a lather, and she hasn’t had time to eat her oats.”"
"“那就让它饿死好了！”科尔蒙小姐大叫道，心想，“只要我能嫁人就行。”","“Then let her starve!” cried Mademoiselle Cormon; “provided I marry,” she thought to herself."
"这句话对若赛特来说，无异于说杀人，顿时她目瞪口呆地站在那里，一动也不动。直到女主人向她打了一个手势，她才缓过神来，赶紧冲下台阶。","Hearing these words, which seemed to her like homicide, Josette stood still for a moment, speechless.Then, at a gesture from her mistress, she ran headlong down the steps of the portico."
"“小姐着魔了，雅克兰。”这是若赛特缓过神说的第一句话。","“The devil is in her, Jacquelin,” were the first words she uttered."
"于是，这一天，所有一切都相互配合，产生出伟大的戏剧效果，决定了科尔蒙小姐未来的生活。伴随着科尔蒙小姐返回的有五件严重情况：一是倾盆大雨；二是珀涅罗珀飞奔回来，浑身是汗，精疲力竭；三是一大早的时刻；四是没有收拾好的包裹；五是那老小姐异常激动的表情。全城都因此而陷入一片混乱之中了。再看到玛丽埃特闯进市场，见什么好买什么；加上雅克兰来到距离教堂两步远的赛镇门大街，到阿郎松城里主要的软垫家具店里要买一张床的时候，大家都觉得事态严重了。大家都在到处谈论和琢磨这些事，它们已经占据了每个人的脑海，甚至包括阿芒德小姐，当时她正和德瓦卢瓦先生在一起。前后也就两天的时间，阿郎松城受到如此重大事件的连续冲击，以至于有几位善良的女士说世界末日就要到了。然而，这条消息最后都归为一个问题——“科尔蒙家到底发生什么事了？”","Thus all things conspired on this fateful day to produce the great scenic effect which decided the future life of Mademoiselle Cormon.The town was already topsy-turvy in mind, as a consequence of the five extraordinary circumstances which accompanied Mademoiselle Cormon’s return; to wit, the pouring rain; Penelope at a gallop, in a lather, and blown; the early hour; the parcels half-packed; and the singular air of the excited old maid.But when Mariette made an invasion of the market, and bought all the best things; when Jacquelin went to the principal upholsterer in Alencon, two doors from the church, in search of a bed,—there was matter for the gravest conjectures.These extraordinary events were discussed on all sides; they occupied the minds of every one, even Mademoiselle Armande herself, with whom was Monsieur de Valois.Within two days the town of Alencon had been agitated by such startling events that certain good women were heard to remark that the world was coming to an end.This last news, however, resolved itself into a single question, “What is happening at the Cormons?”"
"德斯蓬德神父走出圣莱奥纳尔教堂时，本打算和库蒂里耶神父一起去散步，这时有人很机智地打探消息，于是他以惯常的友好态度告诉对方，他正等待着德特雷维尔子爵驾到。这位子爵曾在流放期间为俄国服务，现在要回阿郎松定居。于是从下午两点到五点，全城都在以嘴唇散布电报。所有的居民都知道科尔蒙小姐通过书信终于找到一个丈夫，并且她就要嫁给德特雷维尔子爵了。有人说：“莫罗已经卖给他们一张床呢。”在那片地方，传言说那张床有六尺宽；在羊圈街，格朗松太太家，说那张床是四尺宽；迪布斯基耶正在迪隆斯雷家吃饭，在那里，有人说，只不过是张简单的沙发床而已。小布尔乔亚们说那床花了有一千一百法郎。但是大家普遍都在想，现在高兴未免为时过早吧。另几处地方，有人说玛丽埃特把市场上的东西抢购一空，以至于鲤鱼的价格都上涨了。在圣布莱兹街尾，大家说珀涅罗珀已经累死了。在税务局长家里，虽然大家不相信珀涅罗珀死了，但是在这一地区已经证实说这牲口在一拐进科尔蒙公馆庭院时就咽气了，因为科尔蒙小姐飞一般地想见她的丈夫，一直叫它狂奔快跑。赛镇大街拐角上的鞍具商，壮着胆子来打听是不是科尔蒙小姐的马车出问题了，以了解珀涅罗珀是不是真的死了。从圣布莱兹街头到羊圈街尾，大家终于得知，幸亏有雅克兰的精心护理，珀涅罗珀这个无辜受女主人迫害的牲口还活着，不过看上去是有点问题。","The Abbe de Sponde, adroitly questioned when he left Saint-Leonard’s to take his daily walk with the Abbe Couturier, replied with his usual kindliness that he expected the Vicomte de Troisville, a nobleman in the service of Russia during the Emigration, who was returning to Alencon to settle there.From two to five o’clock a species of labial telegraphy went on throughout the town; and all the inhabitants learned that Mademoiselle Cormon had at last found a husband by letter, and was about to marry the Vicomte de Troisville.Some said, “Moreau has sold them a bed.”The bed was six feet wide in that quarter; it was four feet wide at Madame Granson’s, in the rue du Bercail; but it was reduced to a simple couch at Monsieur du Ronceret’s, where du Bousquier was dining.The lesser bourgeoisie declared that the cost was eleven hundred francs.But generally it was thought that, as to this, rumor was counting the chickens before they were hatched.In other quarters it was said that Mariette had made such a raid on the market that the price of carp had risen.At the end of the rue Saint-Blaise, Penelope had dropped dead.This decease was doubted in the house of the receiver-general; but at the Prefecture it was authenticated that the poor beast had expired as she turned into the courtyard of the hotel Cormon, with such velocity had the old maid flown to meet her husband.The harness-maker, who lived at the corner of the rue de Seez, was bold enough to call at the house and ask if anything had happened to Mademoiselle Cormon’s carriage, in order to discover whether Penelope was really dead.From the end of the rue Saint-Blaise to the end of the rue du Bercail, it was then made known that, thanks to Jacquelin’s devotion, Penelope, that silent victim of her mistress’s impetuosity, still lived, though she seemed to be suffering."
"整个布列塔尼大道上，大家都说，德特雷维尔子爵是家中幼子，一文不名，因为佩尔舍的财产都归他哥哥德特雷维尔侯爵所有。德特雷维尔侯爵是法国贵族院议员，有孩子。因此这桩婚事真是便宜了那个流亡国外的可怜人。而布列塔尼大道上的贵族都赞成这桩婚事，说科尔蒙小姐的财产实在不能派上再好的用场了。但是在市民阶层，大家说德特雷维尔子爵是曾与法国作战的俄国将军，他这次归来带了大笔在圣彼得堡宫廷中赚来的财富；大家还说他是自由党痛恨的外国人；有人说，是德斯蓬德神父暗中撮合了这件婚事。凡是有权去拜访科尔蒙小姐的人，都决定今晚去看她。","Along the road to Brittany the Vicomte de Troisville was stated to be a younger son without a penny, for the estates in Perche belonged to the Marquis de Troisville, peer of France, who had children; the marriage would be, therefore, an enormous piece of luck for a poor emigre.The aristocracy along that road approved of the marriage; Mademoiselle Cormon could not do better with her money.But among the Bourgeoisie, the Vicomte de Troisville was a Russian general who had fought against France, and was now returning with a great fortune made at the court of Saint-Petersburg; he was a FOREIGNER; one of those ALLIES so hated by the liberals; the Abbe de Sponde had slyly negotiated this marriage.All the persons who had a right to call upon Mademoiselle Cormon determined to do so that very evening."
"这震动全城的事情，让人几乎忘了苏珊的事。科尔蒙小姐的激动也不亚于其他人，她充满了全新的情感。她望着她的大客厅、饭厅和小客厅，突然一种恐惧感涌上心头。一种类似魔鬼的东西在嘲笑她这些过时的奢侈品。这些她从小欣赏的漂亮什物突然让她觉得是不是过于陈旧和可笑了。简而言之，她感受到了几乎所有作家都经历过的那种恐惧，每当非常严格或是感觉麻木的批评家读自己的新作品时，即使他们以为自己的作品很完美了，但还是忐忑不安。原本是全新的情景，现在觉得很老套；原本是表述很漂亮、精雕细琢的词句，现在觉得无力而偏颇了；比喻和形象都变得具有嘲讽意味而且互相矛盾；文中的错误变得十分显眼。同样，这可怜的老姑娘很害怕德特雷维尔先生见了这间主教客厅，嘴唇上会掠过轻蔑的一笑；她害怕他会冷冷地看着这古老的饭厅；总之，她害怕那镜框会让那肖像画变得老气。要是这些古董使她也显得苍老了怎么办？这个问题让她浑身起鸡皮疙瘩。这时候，如果有魔棒可以将她的房屋瞬间装修一新，就算要花去她的一半积蓄她也愿意。哪个将军在临上战场时，不曾发抖过呢？这个可怜的姑娘现在就是处在她的奥斯特利兹战役和滑铁卢战役中。","During this transurban excitement, which made that of Suzanne almost a forgotten affair, Mademoiselle was not less agitated; she was filled with a variety of novel emotions.Looking about her salon, dining-room, and boudoir, cruel apprehensions took possession of her.A species of demon showed her with a sneer her old-fashioned luxury.The handsome things she had admired from her youth up she suddenly suspected of age and absurdity.In short, she felt that fear which takes possession of nearly all authors when they read over a work they have hitherto thought proof against every exacting or blase critic: new situations seem timeworn; the best-turned and most highly polished phrases limp and squint; metaphors and images grin or contradict each other; whatsoever is false strikes the eye.In like manner this poor woman trembled lest she should see on the lips of Monsieur de Troisville a smile of contempt for this episcopal salon; she dreaded the cold look he might cast over that ancient dining-room; in short, she feared the frame might injure and age the portrait.Suppose these antiquities should cast a reflected light of old age upon herself?This question made her flesh creep.She would gladly, at that moment, spend half her savings on refitting her house if some fairy wand could do it in a moment.Where is the general who has not trembled on the eve of a battle?The poor woman was now between her Austerlitz and her Waterloo."
"“德特雷维尔子爵夫人，”她自言自语道，“多高贵的名字呀！至少我们的财产落入好人家了。”","“Madame la Vicomtesse de Troisville,” she said to herself; “a noble name!Our property will go to a good family, at any rate.”"
"她完全处在心烦意乱中，每一束最细微的神经和深埋在她的肥肉中的神经末梢都在颤抖。这新的希望加快了她的血液循环。她觉得，如果有必要的话，她自己还有足够的精力和德特雷维尔先生谈话。","She fell a prey to an irritation which made every fibre of her nerves quiver to all their papillae, long sunk in flesh.Her blood, lashed by this new hope, was in motion.She felt the strength to converse, if necessary, with Monsieur de Troisville."
"至于若赛特、雅克兰、玛丽埃特、莫罗和他的助手在怎样紧张地张罗着，就不用赘述了。他们就和蚂蚁运卵一样紧张。平时仔细打理和收拾过的东西，全都重新洗过，刷过，熨过，擦过。盛大节日使用的瓷器，又摆出来重见天日了；绣着A、B、C的缎纹餐巾，平时包裹三层，还用排排别针护着，现在也从柜子深处给请出来了。最后，科尔蒙小姐在她希望的祭坛上奉献出三瓶昂伏夫人的名酒，这可是热带地区最著名的酿酒商，对嗜酒者来说这是十分亲切的名字。多亏小姐手下的副官们竭诚效力，科尔蒙小姐才得以很快为这场战斗做好准备。各种武器——家具装备，厨房炮兵，储备粮，总之，战争需要的各种军需品以及后备队——都已全线备齐。雅克兰、玛丽埃特和若赛特收到命令，都要穿上礼服。花园也已耙平整了。老姑娘就遗憾不懂鸟语，不能和栖息在树上的夜莺商量，让它们到时献上最美妙的歌声。","It is useless to relate the activity with which Josette, Jacquelin, Mariette, Moreau, and his agents went about their functions.It was like the busyness of ants about their eggs.All that daily care had already rendered neat and clean was again gone over and brushed and rubbed and scrubbed.The china of ceremony saw the light; the damask linen marked “A, B, C” was drawn from depths where it lay under a triple guard of wrappings, still further defended by formidable lines of pins.Above all, Mademoiselle Cormon sacrificed on the altar of her hopes three bottles of the famous liqueurs of Madame Amphoux, the most illustrious of all the distillers of the tropics,—a name very dear to gourmets.Thanks to the devotion of her lieutenants, mademoiselle was soon ready for the conflict.The different weapons—furniture, cookery, provisions, in short, all the various munitions of war, together with a body of reserve forces—were ready along the whole line.Jacquelin, Mariette, and Josette received orders to appear in full dress.The garden was raked.The old maid regretted that she couldn’t come to an understanding with the nightingales nesting in the trees, in order to obtain their finest trilling."
"四点钟左右，德斯蓬德神父刚回到家，而小姐已开始怀疑她这最精美的晚餐和最精美的餐具都白白准备了。就在这时，终于从瓦诺布勒传来了马车夫甩鞭子的噼啪声。","At last, about four o’clock, at the very moment when the Abbe de Sponde returned home, and just as mademoiselle began to think she had set the table with the best plate and linen and prepared the choicest dishes to no purpose, the click-clack of a postilion was heard in the Val-Noble."
"“是他！”小姐心想，那每一鞭都抽在她的心上。","“‘Tis he!” she said to herself, the snap of the whip echoing in her heart."
"果然，一辆从驿站雇的带蓬双轮轻便马车到了，车上只坐了一位先生。虽然各种流言蜚语都宣告了这辆车的到来，但当马车沿圣布莱兹街下到林阴大道上时，还是轰动了全城，以至于几个顽童和大人跟着车前进，聚在科尔蒙公馆大门附近，看着马车进入公馆。雅克兰从小姐的婚事中看到了自己的婚期，他也听到圣布莱兹街上的鞭声，把庭院的两扇大门大大敞开。那马车夫是他的朋友，只见他很得意地一个漂亮的拐弯，将马车拐进大门，停在台阶的前面。神父上前迎接他的客人，车上的东西转眼间就被卸完了，仿佛路上的强盗干得一般；马车停进车棚，大门关闭，就这么一会儿功夫，德特雷维尔先生到来的所有痕迹都消失了。任何两种化学物质相混合的速度，也比不上科尔蒙家将德特雷维尔子爵吸收进门的速度了。","True enough; heralded by all this gossip, a post-chaise, in which was a single gentleman, made so great a sensation coming down the rue Saint-Blaise and turning into the rue du Cours that several little gamains and some grown persons followed it, and stood in groups about the gate of the hotel Cormon to see it enter.Jacquelin, who foresaw his own marriage in that of his mistress, had also heard the click-clack in the rue Saint-Blaise, and had opened wide the gates into the courtyard.The postilion, a friend of his, took pride in making a fine turn-in, and drew up sharply before the portico.The abbe came forward to greet his guest, whose carriage was emptied with a speed that highwaymen might put into the operation; the chaise itself was rolled into the coach-house, the gates closed, and in a few moments all signs of Monsieur de Troisville’s arrival had disappeared.Never did two chemicals blend into each other with greater rapidity than the hotel Cormon displayed in absorbing the Vicomte de Troisville."
"科尔蒙小姐的心脏跳得像个被牧童抓住的蜥蜴一样，但是她颇有英雄气概地坐在炉火旁边的安乐椅上。若赛特打开客厅的门，德特雷维尔子爵走在德斯蓬德神父的前面，出现在老姑娘的眼前。","Mademoiselle, whose heart was beating like a lizard caught by a herdsman, sat heroically still on her sofa, beside the fire in the salon.Josette opened the door; and the Vicomte de Troisville, followed by the Abbe de Sponde, presented himself to the eyes of the spinster."
"“外甥女，这是德特雷维尔子爵先生，我中学时代的老同学的孙子；德特雷维尔先生，这是我的外甥女科尔蒙小姐。“","“Niece, this is Monsieur le Vicomte de Troisville, the grandson of one of my old schoolmates; Monsieur de Troisville, my niece, Mademoiselle Cormon.”"
"“哇，真是好舅舅，他互相介绍得真好呀！”罗丝—玛丽—维克图瓦心想。","“Ah! That good uncle; how well he does it!” thought Rose-Marie-Victoire."
"要一句话描绘出德特雷维尔子爵的话，可以说，他是贵族化了的迪布斯基耶。这两人的全部区别，就在于庸俗和高雅之分。如果他们俩站在一起，恐怕就是最狂乱的自由党也无法否认贵族的优越。子爵的力量就在于他具备高雅的全部特点，他的举止保持着高度的贵族尊严。他有一双蓝眼睛，深色头发，橄榄色的皮肤，看上去四十六岁左右。你会认为他就是一位在俄国的冰雪中保存完好的西班牙美男子。他的举止、他的风度，都说明他是一位见识过整个欧洲的外交家。他的穿着正是一位很体面的旅者的装束。他看上去很疲倦，于是神父建议带他到为他准备的房间休息一下。当外甥女打开已经改装成卧室的小客厅的房门时，神父都惊呆了。","The Vicomte de Troisville was, to paint him in two words, du Bousquier ennobled.Between the two men there was precisely the difference which separates the vulgar style from the noble style.If they had both been present, the most fanatic liberal would not have denied the existence of aristocracy.The viscount’s strength had all the distinction of elegance; his figure had preserved its magnificent dignity.He had blue eyes, black hair, an olive skin, and looked to be about forty-six years of age.You might have thought him a handsome Spaniard preserved in the ice of Russia.His manner, carriage, and attitude, all denoted a diplomat who had seen Europe.His dress was that of a well-bred traveller.As he seemed fatigued, the abbe offered to show him to his room, and was much amazed when his niece threw open the door of the boudoir, transformed into a bedroom."
"科尔蒙小姐和她的舅父于是走开，让这位尊贵的客人在雅克兰的帮助下去收拾自己的物品。雅克兰将他的行李一一送过来，而德斯蓬德神父和外甥女则沿着亮河去散步，等待他们的客人梳洗完毕。碰巧今天德斯蓬德神父比平时更加心不在焉，科尔蒙小姐这时也心事重重。他们俩都默默地走着。这老姑娘从未见过比这位严肃又恬静的子爵更具有诱惑力的男人。她大概会像德国人那样想：“这正是我想要的！”但是她感到从头到脚都被慑服了，而只能说：“我的爱情来了！”然后，她飞奔到玛丽埃特那询问，能不能让晚餐推后一点，但又不影响饭菜的味道。","Mademoiselle Cormon and her uncle then left the noble stranger to attend to his own affairs, aided by Jacquelin, who brought up his luggage, and went themselves to walk beside the river until their guest had made his toilet.Although the Abbe de Sponde chanced to be even more absent-minded than usual, Mademoiselle Cormon was not less preoccupied.They both walked on in silence.The old maid had never before met any man as seductive as this Olympean viscount.She might have said to herself, as the Germans do, “This is my ideal!” instead of which she felt herself bound from head to foot, and could only say, “Here’s my affair!”Then she flew to Mariette to know if the dinner could be put back a while without loss of excellence."
"“舅舅，这位德特雷维尔先生非常和蔼可亲呀。”她回来后说道。","“Uncle, your Monsieur de Troisville is very amiable,” she said, on returning."
"“可是，外甥女，他还没说过一句话呢。”","“Why, niece, he hasn’t as yet said a word.”"
"“但是可以从他的行为、举止和外貌上看出来呀。他是单身吗？”","“But you can see it in his ways, his manners, his face.Is he a bachelor?”"
"“我还真不知道，”神父回答道，心里正想着最近他和库蒂里耶神父关于上帝的仁慈问题的争论，“德特雷维尔先生给我写信说他想在这里买套房子。如果他结婚了，应该不会一个人前来吧。”神父毫不在意地加上一句，压根没想到他的外甥女在想着嫁人呢。","“I’m sure I don’t know,” replied the abbe, who was thinking of a discussion on mercy, lately begun between the Abbe Couturier and himself.“Monsieur de Troisville wrote me that he wanted to buy a house here.If he was married, he wouldn’t come alone on such an errand,” added the abbe, carelessly, not conceiving the idea that his niece could be thinking of marriage."
"“他很有钱吗？”","“Is he rich?”"
"“他是幼支的幼子，”神父回答道，“他的祖父曾统帅海军舰队，但是这个年轻人他父亲的婚姻却很不好。”","“He is a younger son of the younger branch,” replied her uncle.“His grandfather commanded a squadron, but the father of this young man made a bad marriage.”"
"“年轻人！”老姑娘重复道，“可是，舅舅，我觉得他至少四十五岁了！”她有强烈的欲望要让他们两人的年纪相当才行。","“Young man!” exclaimed the old maid.“It seems to me, uncle, that he must be at least forty-five.”She felt the strongest desire to put their years on a par."
"“是的，”神父说，“但是对于一个已经七十岁的可怜的神父看来，罗丝，一个四十岁的人还很年轻呢。”","“Yes,” said the abbe; “but to a poor priest of seventy, Rose, a man of forty seems a youth.”"
"此刻阿郎松全城都已经知道，德特雷维尔子爵先生已经到达科尔蒙小姐家。这位旅行家不久便前来和家中主人会齐，开始欣赏亮河的景色、花园和房屋。","All Alencon knew by this time that Monsieur de Troisville had arrived at the Cormons.The traveller soon rejoined his hosts, and began to admire the Brillante, the garden, and the house."
"“神父先生，”他说，“我全部的雄心就是要找一处像这栋房屋一样的住宅。”老姑娘听了这句话，以为是向她求爱了，于是垂下眼帘。“小姐在这里生活，一定很开心吧。”子爵又说道。","“Monsieur l’abbe,” he said, “my whole ambition is to have a house like this.”The old maid fancied a declaration lurked in that speech, and she lowered her eyes.“You must enjoy it very much, mademoiselle,” added the viscount."
"“我怎么能不开心呢？这所住宅从一五七四年就属于我们家。那年，我们的一位祖先，阿郎松公爵的总管得到了这块地，并建造了这所房屋。”科尔蒙小姐说。“这房屋是用支柱架空的。”她补充道。","“How could it be otherwise?It has been in our family since 1574, the period at which one of our ancestors, steward to the Duc d’Alencon, acquired the land and built the house,” replied Mademoiselle Cormon.“It is built on piles,” she added."
"雅克兰宣布晚饭准备好了。德特雷维尔先生将手臂伸给兴高采烈的老姑娘，老姑娘尽量不紧靠在那手臂上，依然像往常一样担心会造成自己主动追求的感觉。","Jacquelin announced dinner.Monsieur de Troisville offered his arm to the happy woman, who endeavored not to lean too heavily upon it; she feared, as usual, to seem to make advances."
"“这里的一切都很和谐。”子爵在餐桌前就座时说道。","“Everything is so harmonious here,” said the viscount, as he seated himself at table."
"“是呀，我们的树林里都是小鸟，给我们免费演奏音乐；没有人会去惊扰它们；夜莺们每晚都歌唱。”科尔蒙小姐说。","“Yes, our trees are full of birds, which give us concerts for nothing; no one ever frightens them; and the nightingales sing at night,” said Mademoiselle Cormon."
"“我是说室内的布置呢。”子爵说，他根本没有费心去观察科尔蒙小姐，也因此没有发现她的愚昧。“所有的一切都很相称，色彩的搭配、家具以及总的格调。”","“I was speaking of the interior of the house,” remarked the viscount, who did not trouble himself to observe Mademoiselle Cormon, and therefore did not perceive the dulness of her mind.“Everything is so in keeping,—the tones of color, the furniture, the general character.”"
"“但是我们可花了不少钱呢，税额太高了。”这了不起的老姑娘回答道。","“But it costs a great deal; taxes are enormous,” responded the excellent woman."
"“啊？这个地方税额很高吗？”子爵说，一心想着自己的事。","“Ah! Taxes are high, are they?” said the viscount, preoccupied with his own ideas."
"“我不知道，”神父回答,“都是我的外甥女管理我们的产业。”","“I don’t know,” replied the abbe.“My niece manages the property of each of us.”"
"“对于有钱人来说，交税不算什么啦。”科尔蒙小姐说，不想让对方认为她很吝啬，“至于家具，我一直保持原样，不做变动。除非我结婚，那就另当别论了，这里的一切都得符合男主人的口味。”","“Taxes are not of much importance to the rich,” said Mademoiselle Cormon, not wishing to be thought miserly.“As for the furniture, I shall leave it as it is, and change nothing,—unless I marry; and then, of course, everything here must suit the husband.”"
"“您的原则很明确呀，小姐，”子爵微笑着说，“您一定会让男人幸福的。”","“You have noble principles, mademoiselle,” said the viscount, smiling.“You will make one happy man.”"
"“从没有人对我说过这么动听的话。”老姑娘心想。","“No one ever made to me such a pretty speech,” thought the old maid."
"子爵称赞科尔蒙小姐招待周到，家里的摆设也让人赏心悦目，说自己原以为外省很落后，现在发现外省像英国人说的一样——“非常舒适”。","The viscount complimented Mademoiselle Cormon on the excellence of her service and the admirable arrangements of the house, remarking that he had supposed the provinces behind the age in that respect; but, on the contrary, he found them, as the English say, “very comfortable.”"
"“这个英语词什么意思呀？”她心想，“哦，骑士在的话就能告诉我了，可他在哪儿呢？‘Comfortable’——听上去好像不止一个词啊。算了，勇敢些！”她暗想道。“我可不能回答外语，但是，”她高声接下去，就像任何人在重要场合都会变得能说会道一样，她也感觉话匣子打开了，说道，“先生，我们这里有最优秀的社交团体。全城的人都在我家聚会，您今晚就能了解到了。我们的一些朋友们知道我回来了，您来了，他们肯定会来看我的。他们当中有德瓦卢瓦骑士，他是过去的宫廷贵人，有着无穷的机智和高品位；还有德埃斯格里尼翁侯爵和他的妹妹阿芒德小姐（她不安地咬了下自己的舌头），她是一个很特别的高贵的姑娘。”她补充道，“她甘愿终身不嫁，以便将她所有的财产留给她的哥哥和她的侄子。”","“What can that word mean?” she thought.“Oh, where is the chevalier to explain it to me?‘Comfortable,’—there seem to be several words in it.Well, courage!” she said to herself.“I can’t be expected to answer a foreign language—But,” she continued aloud, feeling her tongue untied by the eloquence which nearly all human creatures find in momentous circumstances, “we have a very brilliant society here, monsieur.It assembles at my house, and you shall judge of it this evening, for some of my faithful friends have no doubt heard of my return and your arrival.Among them is the Chevalier de Valois, a seigneur of the old court, a man of infinite wit and taste; then there is Monsieur le Marquis d’Esgrignon and Mademoiselle Armande, his sister” (she bit her tongue with vexation),—“a woman remarkable in her way,” she added.“She resolved to remain unmarried in order to leave all her fortune to her brother and nephew.”"
"“啊！”子爵说道，“是呀，德埃斯格里尼翁家，我记得他们。”","“Ah!” exclaimed the viscount.“Yes, the d’Esgrignons,—I remember them.”"
"“阿郎松是个很快活的地方，”老姑娘一发不可收拾地接着说道，“在这儿有很多消遣，税务局长会举办舞会，省长非常和蔼可亲，主教大人还会时不时地光临寒舍——”","“Alencon is very gay,” continued the old maid, now fairly launched.“There’s much amusement: the receiver-general gives balls; the prefect is an amiable man; and Monseigneur the bishop sometimes honors us with a visit—”"
"“啊，这样看来，”子爵微笑地说道，“我选择回到这里，落叶归根是很明智的啦。”","“Well, then,” said the viscount, smiling, “I have done wisely to come back, like the hare, to die in my form.”"
"“是的，”她说道，“我也是，要一直呆在这里，不然就会死掉。”","“Yes,” she said.“I, too, attach myself or I die.”"
"子爵笑了笑。","The viscount smiled."
"“啊！”老姑娘心想，“一切都很顺利，他能理解我。”","“Ah!” thought the old maid, “all is well; he understands me.”"
"接下去，谈话转入一般的话题。受到一股神秘的、莫名的、叫不上名字的强大力量的影响，科尔蒙小姐拼命搜索脑中德瓦卢瓦骑士的各种句式，好让自己显得可爱。这就像在一场决斗中，似乎魔鬼亲自给你调好了手枪一样。从来就没有这么准地瞄准过对手。子爵出身高贵，因此不会说些赞美话来表示晚餐的鲜美，但是他的沉默就等于一种赞扬。雅克兰给他斟上一杯又一杯的美酒，他感觉像旧友重逢，不亦乐乎；因为真正的鉴赏家不会鼓掌，而是静静地品味享受。他询问了地皮、房产和庄园的价格；他让科尔蒙小姐详细地描述了亮河与萨尔特河汇合处的情形。对于城市建在距离河流这样远的地方，他感到很奇怪，似乎他很关心当地的地形。","The conversation continued on generalities.By one of those mysterious unknown and undefinable faculties, Mademoiselle Cormon found in her brain, under the pressure of her desire to be agreeable, all the phrases and opinions of the Chevalier de Valois.It was like a duel in which the devil himself pointed the pistol.Never was any adversary better aimed at.The viscount was far too well-bred to speak of the excellence of the dinner; but his silence was praise.As he drank the delicious wines which Jacquelin served to him profusely, he seemed to feel he was with friends, and to meet them with pleasure; for the true connoisseur does not applaud, he enjoys.He inquired the price of land, of houses, of estates; he made Mademoiselle Cormon describe at length the confluence of the Sarthe and the Brillante; he expressed surprise that the town was placed so far from the river, and seemed to be much interested in the topography of the place."
"沉默的神父任由他的外甥女主导谈话，并且科尔蒙小姐也认为她已经占据了德特雷维尔先生的心，因为对方频频向她亲切地微笑。他在晚餐过程中作出的保证，比她最殷勤的追求者十天内作出的保证还多得多。因此，各位可以想见这位先生受到的无微不至的关怀，就像是一位心爱的夫君回到了家中，给家中带来了欢乐。科尔蒙小姐留心估计子爵什么时候要面包；她观察他每一个眼神；当他扭头的时候，她便巧妙地给他盛上看上去他喜欢的菜。如果他是个贪吃的人，她早就把他撑死了。但是，她倒是很好地表现了一个丈夫所欣赏的女人该有的本领。她没有做贬低自己的蠢事，相反，她大胆地张开了所有的船帆，挂上所有旗号，摆出阿郎松女王的架势，吹嘘自己的果酱做得有多好。事实上，她是靠大谈自己来捞取恭维。她发现自己很讨子爵的喜欢，热切的希望使她完全改变了模样，让她几乎成了一个女人。","The silent abbe left his niece to throw the dice of conversation; and she truly felt that she pleased Monsieur de Troisville, who smiled at her gracefully, and committed himself during this dinner far more than her most eager suitors had ever done in ten days.Imagine, therefore, the little attentions with which he was petted; you might have thought him a cherished lover, whose return brought joy to the household.Mademoiselle foresaw the moment when the viscount wanted bread; she watched his every look; when he turned his head she adroitly put upon his plate a portion of some dish he seemed to like; had he been a gourmand, she would almost have killed him; but what a delightful specimen of the attentions she would show to a husband!She did not commit the folly of depreciating herself; on the contrary, she set every sail bravely, ran up all her flags, assumed the bearing of the queen of Alencon, and boasted of her excellent preserves.In fact, she fished for compliments in speaking of herself, for she saw that she pleased the viscount; the truth being that her eager desire had so transformed her that she became almost a woman."
"上甜点的时候，她满心欢喜地听到前厅和客厅的声响，说明她的那些常客已经来了。她让她舅舅和德特雷维尔先生注意到常客们的殷勤来访，因为这是人们爱戴她的一个证明。而实际上，大家是因为受这袭扰全城的强烈好奇心驱使而来的。科尔蒙小姐迫不及待地要满载荣誉地出现在人们面前，于是吩咐雅克兰去到客厅里给客人上咖啡和烈酒。在客厅里，仆人可以在社交界的精华面前，炫耀一下萨克森咖啡具的气派，这套咖啡具一年只从柜子里取出来使用两次。人们都注意到这情形，已经站在那里开始小声议论了。","At dessert she heard, not without emotions of delight, certain sounds in the antechamber and salon which denoted the arrival of her usual guests.She called the attention of her uncle and Monsieur de Troisville to this prompt attendance as a proof of the affection that was felt for her; whereas it was really the result of the poignant curiosity which had seized upon the town.Impatient to show herself in all her glory, Mademoiselle Cormon told Jacquelin to serve coffee and liqueurs in the salon, where he presently set out, in view of the whole company, a magnificent liqueur-stand of Dresden china which saw the light only twice a year.This circumstance was taken note of by the company, standing ready to gossip over the merest trifle:—"
"“有什么了不起！”迪布斯基耶喃喃自语道，“事实上，他们一年四大节日才会上昂伏夫人的烈性酒！”","“The deuce!” muttered du Bousquier.“Actually Madame Amphoux’s liqueurs, which they only serve at the four church festivals!”"
"“这件婚事肯定是一年前通过书信安排好的，”法院院长迪龙瑟雷先生说，“邮政局长告诉我这一年多来经常收到盖有敖德萨邮戳的信。”","“Undoubtedly the marriage was arranged a year ago by letter,” said the chief-justice du Ronceret.“The postmaster tells me his office has received letters postmarked Odessa for more than a year.”"
"格朗松太太浑身都震颤了。德瓦卢瓦骑士虽然吃了相当于四个人的饭，但这会儿连左半边脸都发白了。感到自己内心的秘密就要泄露出去，他仓促地说道：","Madame Granson trembled.The Chevalier de Valois, though he had dined with the appetite of four men, turned pale even to the left section of his face.Feeling that he was about to betray himself, he said hastily,—"
"“您不觉得今天特别冷吗？我都快要冻僵了。”","“Don’t you think it is very cold to-day?I am almost frozen.”"
"“也许是因为在俄国附近的缘故吧。”迪布斯基耶说。","“The neighborhood of Russia, perhaps,” said du Bousquier."
"骑士看了他一眼，似乎在说：“说得太妙了！”","The chevalier looked at him as if to say, “Well played!”"
"科尔蒙小姐出现了，她是那么精神焕发，那么得意，让大家都觉得她变漂亮了。这不同寻常的神采不仅是由于感情的影响。自早晨起，她浑身的血液就在她体内沸腾，对于某种重大危机的预感一直在刺激着她的神经。得同时出现所有这些情况，她才会变得如此判若两人。她怀着无比幸福的心情郑重其事地将子爵介绍给骑士，再将骑士介绍给子爵，并将全体阿郎松人都介绍给德特雷维尔先生，并将德特雷维尔先生介绍给全体阿郎松人！","Mademoiselle Cormon appeared so radiant, so triumphant, that the company thought her handsome.This extraordinary brilliancy was not the effect of sentiment only.Since early morning her blood had been whirling tempestuously within her, and her nerves were agitated by the presentiment of some great crisis.It required all these circumstances combined to make her so unlike herself.With what joy did she now make her solemn presentation of the viscount to the chevalier, the chevalier to the viscount, and all Alencon to Monsieur de Troisville, and Monsieur de Troisville to all Alencon!"
"出于完全可以理解的偶然，子爵和骑士这两个具有贵族本性的人，相见后一拍即合，他们互相认出了同类。于是，两人便站在壁炉前畅聊起来。他们四周围了一圈人，虽然他们说话的声音很低，但是大家都在屏住气息听他们谈话。为了很好地展现出这个场面的效果，有必要以剧本的形式描述一下。科尔蒙小姐当时正背对着壁炉，忙着为他所谓的求婚者上咖啡。","By an accident wholly explainable, the viscount and chevalier, aristocrats by nature, came instantly into unison; they recognized each other at once as men belonging to the same sphere.Accordingly, they began to converse together, standing before the fireplace.A circle formed around them; and their conversation, though uttered in a low voice, was listened to in religious silence.To give the effect of this scene it is necessary to dramatize it, and to picture Mademoiselle Cormon occupied in pouring out the coffee of her imaginary suitor, with her back to the fireplace."
"德瓦卢瓦先生：“听说子爵先生是来此地定居的，是吗？”","Monsieur de Valois.“Monsieur le vicomte has come, I am told, to settle in Alencon?”"
"德特雷维尔先生：“是的，先生，我正在找房子。（科尔蒙小姐端着咖啡杯转过身来。）得要找间大房子才行，（科尔蒙小姐向他递过杯子）这样才能安置我的家属。”（老姑娘顿时两眼发花。）","Monsieur de Troisville.“Yes, monsieur, I am looking for a house.”(Mademoiselle Cormon, cup in hand, turns round.) “It must be a large house” (Mademoiselle Cormon offers him the cup) “to lodge my whole family.”(The eyes of the old maid are troubled.)"
"德瓦卢瓦先生：“您已经成婚了？”","Monsieur de Valois.“Are you married?”"
"德特雷维尔先生：“是呀，已经结婚十六年了，内人是赛布洛夫公主的女儿。”","Monsieur de Troisville.“Yes, for the last sixteen years, to a daughter of the Princess Scherbellof.”"
"科尔蒙小姐顿时昏倒了；迪布斯基耶见她站不稳，立即上前将她抱住；有人将门打开，好让他将这个庞然大物抱出去。这个脾气暴躁的共和党使出浑身的劲来，在若赛特的指引下，将老姑娘抱到她的卧室里，放到她的床上。若赛特带了剪刀来，将束得紧紧的紧身衣剪开。迪布斯基耶往科尔蒙小姐脸上和身上洒水。紧身衣解开后，小姐身上的肉就像卢瓦尔河发大水一样摊开来。可怜的姑娘睁开眼睛，看见迪布斯基耶，女性的羞耻之心使她看到男人后立即发出一声叫喊。迪布斯基耶赶紧退出卧室，留下六位女士照顾她，为首的是格朗松太太，她兴高采烈地照顾这位病人。","Mademoiselle Cormon fainted; du Bousquier, who saw her stagger, sprang forward and received her in his arms; some one opened the door and allowed him to pass out with his enormous burden.The fiery republican, instructed by Josette, found strength to carry the old maid to her bedroom, where he laid her out on the bed.Josette, armed with scissors, cut the corset, which was terribly tight.Du Bousquier flung water on Mademoiselle Cormon’s face and bosom, which, released from the corset, overflowed like the Loire in flood.The poor woman opened her eyes, saw du Bousquier, and gave a cry of modesty at the sight of him.Du Bousquier retired at once, leaving six women, at the head of whom was Madame Granson, radiant with joy, to take care of the invalid."
"德瓦卢瓦先生一直在干什么呢？他仍旧忠于自己的原则，掩护撤退。","What had the Chevalier de Valois been about all this time?Faithful to his system, he had covered the retreat."
"“可怜的科尔蒙小姐，”他对德特雷维尔先生说道，一边看向在场的人，他那贵族般沉着的目光，让在场的人都止住了自己的笑声，“血热折磨得她够呛。到普雷博戴她的田庄去之前，她不肯让人给放放血。看吧，这下好了！”","“That poor Mademoiselle Cormon,” he said to Monsieur de Troisville, gazing at the assembly, whose laughter was repressed by his cool aristocratic glances, “her blood is horribly out of order; she wouldn’t be bled before going to Prebaudet (her estate),—and see the result!”"
"“她早上淋雨回来的，”德斯蓬德神父说，“可能是着凉了。不要紧的，她只是老病犯了。”","“She came back this morning in the rain,” said the Abbe de Sponde, “and she may have taken cold.It won’t be anything; it is only a little upset she is subject to.”"
"“她昨天才告诉我这三个月来都没有发过病了，还说担心会再犯呢。”骑士说道。","“She told me yesterday she had not had one for three months, adding that she was afraid it would play her a trick at last,” said the chevalier."
"“哈！原来你已经成婚了？”雅克兰看着德特雷维尔先生静静地小口呷着咖啡，自言自语道。","“Ha! So you are married?” said Jacquelin to himself as he looked at Monsieur de Troisville, who was quietly sipping his coffee."
"这个忠诚的奴仆也分担了女主人的沮丧心情，猜到了她的心思，他立即将昂伏夫人的烈性酒端走了，那是用来款待单身汉的，而不是款待一个俄国女人的丈夫的。","The faithful servant espoused his mistress’s disappointment; he divined it, and he promptly carried away the liqueurs of Madame Amphoux, which were offered to a bachelor, and not to the husband of a Russian woman."
"大家都注意到了这些细节，都成了他们的笑料。德斯蓬德神父本来知道德特雷维尔先生此行的目的，但是由于他一贯的心不在焉，竟然丝毫没有向他的外甥女提起。他怎么也想不到他的外甥女会对德特雷维尔先生产生兴趣。而子爵也一心想着自己此行的目的，并且，像许多丈夫一样，不着急提起自己的妻室，况且他也没有机会说自己已经结婚了。此外，他可能很自然地认为科尔蒙小姐已经知道了。","All these details were noticed and laughed at.The Abbe de Sponde knew the object of Monsieur de Troisville’s journey; but, absent-minded as usual, he forgot it, not supposing that his niece could have the slightest interest in Monsieur de Troisville’s marriage.As for the viscount, preoccupied with the object of his journey, and, like many husbands, not eager to talk about his wife, he had had no occasion to say he was married; besides, he would naturally suppose that Mademoiselle Cormon knew it."
"迪布斯基耶一露面，大家便刨根究底地向他询问情况。楼上六位女士中的一位不久便下楼来，宣布科尔蒙小姐已经好转多了，而且还请来了医生。她还需要卧床休息，并且急需放血。客厅现在宾客已满。科尔蒙小姐不在场，女士们得以大谈特谈刚才那一幕，将这悲喜剧的一幕加以铺陈、评论、美化、修饰、添油加醋地大肆渲染了一番。到了第二天，整个阿郎松城一定会对这一幕念念不忘。","Du Bousquier reappeared, and was questioned furiously.One of the six women came down soon after, and announced that Mademoiselle Cormon was much better, and that the doctor had come.She intended to stay in bed, as it was necessary to bleed her.The salon was now full.Mademoiselle Cormon’s absence allowed the ladies present to discuss the tragi-comic scene—embellished, extended, historified, embroidered, wreathed, colored, and adorned—which had just taken place, and which, on the morrow, was destined to occupy all Alencon."
"“迪布斯基耶先生真是好呀！他抱着您的时候有多稳呀！”若赛特对女主人说,“他见您病了，脸都白了；他还爱着您呢。”","“That good Monsieur du Bousquier!How well he carried you!” said Josette to her mistress.“He was really pale at the sight of you; he loves you still.”"
"这句话便是这隆重而又可怕的晚宴的结束语了。","That speech served as closure to this solemn and terrible evening."
"第二天上午，这出喜剧的细枝末节都在阿郎松的家家户户传遍了。说句让这个城市丢人的话吧，这些细节引起了难以停息的笑声。第二天，科尔蒙小姐放血后，身体大有好转，她让那个并非故意愚弄她的人挎着胳膊去吃早饭。即使对那些最胆大包天的嘲笑者来说，如果他们看到她这个时候表现出来的高贵尊严和激励着她的了不起的基督教逆来顺受的精神，一定会觉得她令人崇敬。拿她开心的冷酷的人们！看看她对子爵说了什么吧：","Throughout the morning of the next day every circumstance of the late comedy was known in the household of Alencon, and—let us say it to the shame of that town,—they caused inextinguishable laughter.But on that day Mademoiselle Cormon (much benefited by the bleeding) would have seemed sublime even to the boldest scoffers, had they witnessed the noble dignity, the splendid Christian resignation which influenced her as she gave her arm to her involuntary deceiver to go into breakfast.Cruel jesters!Why could you not have seen her as she said to the viscount,—"
"“德特雷维尔夫人在这里很难找到适合她的房子的；先生，在您还没有安排好住宅以前，请您赏光，就先暂住在我家里吧。”","“Madame de Troisville will have difficulty in finding a suitable house; do me the favor, monsieur, of accepting the use of mine during the time you are in search of yours.”"
"“可是，小姐，我有两个女儿和两个儿子，那样的话就太麻烦你们了。”","“But, mademoiselle, I have two sons and two daughters; we should greatly inconvenience you.”"
"“请您不要拒绝我吧。”她诚恳地说道。","“Pray do not refuse me,” she said earnestly."
"“我给您回信的时候，也告诉您先住在我家了，”神父说道，“但是您没有收到我的回信。”","“I made you the same offer in the answer I wrote to your letter,” said the abbe; “but you did not receive it.”"
"“怎么，舅舅！那您知道——”","“What, uncle! Then you knew—”"
"可怜的老姑娘及时打住。若赛特叹了一口气。子爵和神父都没有察觉到有什么不对。早饭后，德斯蓬德神父按照他们前一晚商量好的计划，带着子爵去看阿郎松有什么房子可以买的，或者看什么地方可以盖房子。","The poor woman stopped.Josette sighed.Neither the viscount nor the abbe observed anything amiss.After breakfast the Abbe de Sponde carried off his guest, as agreed upon the previous evening, to show him the various houses in Alencon which could be bought, and the lots of lands on which he might build."
"只留下科尔蒙小姐独自一人在客厅里，她满脸痛苦地对若赛特说：“我的孩子，现在我已经成了全城的笑柄了。”","Left alone in the salon, Mademoiselle Cormon said to Josette, with a deeply distressed air, “My child, I am now the talk of the whole town.”"
"“这样的话，小姐，你该嫁人啦。”","“Well, then, mademoiselle, you should marry.”"
"“但是我还没有准备好选谁呀。”","“But I am not prepared to make a choice.”"
"“哎呀，我要是您的话，就嫁给迪布斯基耶先生。”","“Bah! If I were in your place, I should take Monsieur du Bousquier.”"
"“若赛特，德瓦卢瓦先生说了他可是铁杆的共和党呀。”","“Josette, Monsieur de Valois says he is so republican.”"
"“您的那些先生，都是胡说八道呢。他们还说他敲共和党的钱呢，他要是那样做的话，那他应该一点儿也不喜欢共和党吧。”若赛特说着走开了。","“They don’t know what they say, your gentlemen: sometimes they declare that he robbed the republic; he couldn’t love it if he did that,” said Josette, departing."
"“没想到这姑娘还挺有头脑的呀。”科尔蒙小姐想道，独自一人在那里发呆，脑中一片茫然。","“That girl has an amazing amount of sense,” thought Mademoiselle Cormon, who remained alone, a prey to her perplexities."
"她很清楚，迅速结婚是唯一堵住全城人的嘴的办法。这最后的受挫，如此明显的丢人，倒是起了一个作用，促使她做个决定。没有头脑的人总是不知好坏地沿着他们选择的路一直跑下去。","She saw plainly that a prompt marriage was the only way to silence the town.This last checkmate, so evidently mortifying, was of a nature to drive her into some extreme action; for persons deficient in mind find difficulty in getting out of any path, either good or evil, into which they have entered."
"两个老光棍都清楚地了解老姑娘即将面临的处境，于是都决定上午就来问候她的身体健康情况，并且趁机以单身汉的姿态“向前挺进”。德瓦卢瓦先生认为这样的情况，需要更仔细地梳洗打扮才行。于是他洗了一个澡，收拾得异乎寻常的整齐。赛查丽娜是第一次也是最后一次见到他很巧妙地略施脂粉。而迪布斯基耶这个大老粗般的共和党，在坚强意志的激励下，对衣着打扮毫不在意，最先来到。","Each of the two old bachelors had fully understood the situation in which Mademoiselle Cormon was about to find herself; consequently, each resolved to call in the course of that morning to ask after her health, and take occasion, in bachelor language, to “press his point.”Monsieur de Valois considered that such an occasion demanded a painstaking toilet; he therefore took a bath and groomed himself with extraordinary care.For the first and last time Cesarine observed him putting on with incredible art a suspicion of rouge.Du Bousquier, on the other hand, that coarse republican, spurred by a brisk will, paid no attention to his dress, and arrived the first."
"这样的小事不仅能决定帝国的命运，也能决定人的命运。凯勒曼的骑兵来到马郎戈，勃吕歇到达滑铁卢，路易十四对欧也纳亲王的蔑视，德南的神父，所有这些造成成败的重大原因，历史上都有记载。但是没有人会将他们生活中的小事记录下来。因此，看看发生了什么吧：德朗热公爵夫人（见《十三人故事》）因为缺乏十分钟的耐心而当了修女，包比诺法官推迟到第二天去询问德埃斯巴侯爵（见《禁治产》），夏尔·葛朗台归来从波尔多上岸，却不从南特回来。这些事情都被人们称之为偶然或是命中注定。仔细往脸上施了一点点脂粉，却让德瓦卢瓦骑士的希望完全破灭；还能有什么方式让这位绅士垮台的吗？他从前靠着美惠三女神活着，那他也注定要死在三女神手里。在骑士最后一次审视他的衣着打扮的时候，粗里粗气的迪布斯基耶已经走进了愁眉苦脸的老姑娘的客厅里。老姑娘刚才还想着骑士挺好的，而看到迪布斯基耶第一个走进客厅，就立刻倾向于这个共和党人了。","Such little things decide the fortunes of men, as they do of empires.Kellerman’s charge at Marengo, Blucher’s arrival at Waterloo, Louis XIV’s disdain for Prince Eugene, the rector of Denain,—all these great causes of fortune or catastrophe history has recorded; but no one ever profits by them to avoid the small neglects of their own life.Consequently, observe what happens: the Duchesse de Langeais (see “History of the Thirteen”) makes herself a nun for the lack of ten minutes’ patience; Judge Popinot (see “Commission in Lunacy”) puts off till the morrow the duty of examining the Marquis d’Espard; Charles Grandet (see “Eugenie Grandet”) goes to Paris from Bordeaux instead of returning by Nantes; and such events are called chance or fatality!A touch of rouge carefully applied destroyed the hopes of the Chevalier de Valois; could that nobleman perish in any other way?He had lived by the Graces, and he was doomed to die by their hand.While the chevalier was giving this last touch to his toilet the rough du Bousquier was entering the salon of the desolate old maid.This entrance produced a thought in Mademoiselle Cormon’s mind which was favorable to the republican, although in all other respects the Chevalier de Valois held the advantages."
"“他就是上帝的旨意！”她看着迪布斯基耶走进来，心想。","“God wills it!” she said piously, on seeing du Bousquier."
"“小姐，请您不要介意我这么着急前来。我信不过我那个傻瓜勒内来打听您的消息，于是亲自前来了。”","“Mademoiselle, you will not, I trust, think my eagerness importunate.I could not trust to my stupid Rene to bring news of your condition, and therefore I have come myself.”"
"“我已经完全好了，”她激动地回答道，“我要谢谢您，迪布斯基耶先生，”她停顿了下，接着用意味深长的声音说道，“昨天真是麻烦您了，让您辛苦地——”","“I am perfectly recovered,” she replied, in a tone of emotion.“I thank you, Monsieur du Bousquier,” she added, after a slight pause, and in a significant tone of voice, “for the trouble you have taken, and for that which I gave you yesterday—”"
"她记起了自己曾躺在迪布斯基耶的怀抱里，又一次让她觉得这是天意。这还是第一次让男人看见她的腰带、束带被剪断，女性的珍宝全部抛洒在珠宝匣外面。","She remembered having been in his arms, and that again seemed to her an order from heaven.She had been seen for the first time by a man with her laces cut, her treasures violently bursting from their casket."
"“我无比荣幸能抱着您，感觉您很轻呀。”","“I carried you with such joy that you seemed to me light.”"
"这时，科尔蒙小姐用她从未看过世界上任何一个男人的目光看了迪布斯基耶一眼。因此这位前商人受到了鼓励，也向这个老姑娘回了个媚眼，打动了老姑娘的心。","Here Mademoiselle Cormon looked at du Bousquier as she had never yet looked at any man in the world.Thus encouraged, the purveyor cast upon the old maid a glance which reached her heart."
"“我真希望，”他说，“那个时刻能让您永远属于我。（老姑娘开心地听着）当您晕倒在床上的时候，真是动人呀。我这辈子还没有见过比您更漂亮的女人呢——当然我是见过许多漂亮女人的。丰满的女人有一个长处，就是看着特别美；她们只要一显露自己的身体，她们就赢了。”","“I would,” he said, “that that moment had given me the right to keep you as mine forever” (she listened with a delighted air); “as you lay fainting upon that bed, you were enchanting.I have never in my life seen a more beautiful person,—and I have seen many handsome women.Plump ladies have this advantage: they are superb to look upon; they have only to show themselves and they triumph.”"
"“您这是取笑我吧，”老姑娘说道，“昨天的事，全城的人都在乱说吧，这很不好呀。”","“I fear you are making fun of me,” said the old maid, “and that is not kind when all the town will probably misinterpret what happened to me yesterday.”"
"“有如我的名字迪布斯基耶一样，小姐，我对您的感情始终如一。您第一次拒绝我，并没有让我灰心。”","“As true as my name is du Bousquier, mademoiselle, I have never changed in my feelings toward you; and your first refusal has not discouraged me.”"
"老姑娘的眼帘低垂着。这对迪布斯基耶来说，可是难熬的一刻呀。然后，科尔蒙小姐打定主意了。她抬起眼来，热泪盈眶，温柔地看了迪布斯基耶一眼。","The old maid’s eyes were lowered.There was a moment of cruel silence for du Bousquier, and then Mademoiselle Cormon decided on her course.She raised her eyelids; tears flowed from her eyes, and she gave du Bousquier a tender glance."
"“真是这样的话，先生，”她颤抖地说，“只要您答应我过基督徒的生活，不会反对我的宗教习惯，不干涉我选择自己的神师，我便答应您的求婚。”她说完，将手伸给他。","“If that is so, monsieur,” she said, in a trembling voice, “promise me to live in a Christian manner, and not oppose my religious customs, but to leave me the right to select my confessors, and I will grant you my hand”; as she said the words, she held it out to him."
"迪布斯基耶紧紧握住这金钱万贯的胖手，庄重地吻了一下。","Du Bousquier seized the good fat hand so full of money, and kissed it solemnly."
"“可是，”她让他亲吻自己的手，接着说道，“我还有一个要求。”","“But,” she said, allowing him to kiss it, “one thing more I must require of you.”"
"“只要我能办到，就一定满足。”商人回道。","“If it is a possible thing, it is granted,” replied the purveyor."
"“唉！”老姑娘接着说，“看在我的份上，我必须要求您承担一项罪过。我觉得这个罪过不小，因为说谎是七条大罪之一。但是，你以后可以忏悔的，对吧？我们以后可以通过苦行来赎罪的（两人深情地互望了一眼）。并且，这个谎也许可以被教会列为善意的谎言——”","“Alas!” returned the old maid.“For my sake, I must ask you to take upon yourself a sin which I feel to be enormous,—for to lie is one of the capital sins.But you will confess it, will you not?We will do penance for it together” (they looked at each other tenderly).“Besides, it may be one of those lies which the Church permits as necessary—”"
"“莫非她和苏珊说的一样？”迪布斯基耶暗想，“这叫什么运气呀!”“小姐，您是指什么呢？”他高声说道。","“Can she be as Suzanne says she is?” thought du Bousquier.“What luck!Well, mademoiselle, what is it?” he said aloud."
"“就是您得自己承认——”","“That you will take upon yourself to—”"
"“什么事？”","“What?”"
"“您要说，这桩婚事我们已经在六个月前谈妥了。”","“To say that this marriage has been agreed upon between us for the last six months.”"
"“可爱的女人，”商人用极其忠诚的语气说道，“只有对一个爱恋了十年之久的女子，男人才愿意做出这样的牺牲。”","“Charming woman,” said the purveyor, in the tone of a man willing to devote himself, “such sacrifices can be made only for a creature adored these ten years.”"
"“即使我对您那么狠心？”她问。","“In spite of my harshness?” she said."
"“是的，即使您对我那样狠心。”","“Yes, in spite of your harshness.”"
"“迪布斯基耶先生，我以前错看您了。”","“Monsieur du Bousquier, I have misjudged you.”"
"她再次向他伸出那只通红的胖手，迪布斯基耶再一次吻了那只手。","Again she held out the fat red hand, which du Bousquier kissed again."
"这时门开了，这对未婚夫妻抬头看看是谁来了。他们看到的是打扮得十分风雅，却姗姗来迟了的德瓦卢瓦骑士。","At this moment the door opened; the betrothed pair, looking round to see who entered, beheld the delightful, but tardy Chevalier de Valois."
"“啊！”他进来时说，“我很高兴您就要起身了，美丽的女王。”","“Ah!” he said, on entering, “I see you are about to be up, fair queen.”"
"她对骑士微笑，感到胸口一阵发紧。德瓦卢瓦骑士显得那么年轻、诱人，他的神情就像是洛赞进宫去看大公主一般。","She smiled at the chevalier, feeling a weight upon her heart.Monsieur de Valois, remarkably young and seductive, had the air of a Lauzunre—entering the apartments of the Grande Mademoiselle in the Palais—Royal."
"“嗨，亲爱的迪布斯基耶，”骑士认为自己稳操胜券，用冷嘲热讽的语气说道，“德特雷维尔先生和德斯蓬德神父正在打量您的房子呢，他们俩就像土地测量员一样。”","“Hey! dear du Bousquier,” said he, in a jaunty tone, so sure was he of success, “Monsieur de Troisville and the Abbe de Sponde are examining your house like appraisers.”"
"“确实！”迪布斯基耶说道，“如果德特雷维尔子爵想要，我四万法郎就卖给他了。现在那所房子对我已经毫无意义了。如果小姐允许我说的话——别人很快就能知道了——小姐，我能说吗？——好！那么，我亲爱的骑士，请您作为第一个得知我们好消息的人吧（科尔蒙小姐垂下眼帘）。科尔蒙小姐早已垂青于我，而这件事我保密了好几个月。过几天我们就要结婚了；婚约已经拟好，明天我们就要签约了。所以，您自然明白，我在天鹅街的房屋对我已经毫无用处了。我一直在私下找寻买主，德斯蓬德神父知道的，所以就把德特雷维尔领到我家去看房呢。”","“Faith!” said du Bousquier, “if the Vicomte de Troisville wants it, it it is his for forty thousand francs.It is useless to me now.If mademoiselle will permit—it must soon be known—Mademoiselle, may I tell it?—Yes!Well, then, be the first, MY DEAR CHEVALIER, to hear” (Mademoiselle Cormon dropped her eyes) “of the honor that mademoiselle has done me, the secret of which I have kept for some months.We shall be married in a few days; the contract is already drawn, and we shall sign it to-morrow.You see, therefore, that my house in the rue du Cygne is useless to me.I have been privately looking for a purchaser for some time; and the Abbe de Sponde, who knew that fact, has naturally taken Monsieur de Troisville to see the house.”"
"这个弥天大谎，说得那么活灵活现，连骑士都被骗住了。那个“我亲爱的骑士”的称呼，正像彼得大帝在波尔塔瓦向查理十二报复从前败在他手下的全部仇恨一样。","This falsehood bore such an appearance of truth that the chevalier was taken in by it.That “my dear chevalier” was like the revenge taken by Peter the Great on Charles XII at Pultawa for all his past defeats."
"迪布斯基耶从前默默忍受了千百支利箭，这下他用这句话痛快地报仇雪恨了。在他得意的时候，他做了一个年轻人的手势，将手插进了假顶发，这样一下子就把假顶发给弄下来了。","Du Bousquier revenged himself deliciously for the thousand little shafts he had long borne in silence; but in his triumph he made a lively youthful gesture by running his hands through his hair, and in so doing he—knocked aside his false front."
"“我恭喜你们二位，”骑士以和悦的声音说道，“并且希望二位能拥有童话故事里那样的结局——他们从此非常幸福，并且生了许多孩子！”说到这儿，他拿了一撮鼻烟。“但是，先生，”他讥讽地加上一句，“您忘了，您戴的是假顶发。”","“I congratulate you both,” said the chevalier, with an agreeable air; “and I wish that the marriage may end like a fairy tale: THEY WERE HAPPY EVER AFTER, AND HAD—MANY—CHILDREN!”So saying, he took a pinch of snuff.“But, monsieur,” he added satirically, “you forget—that you are wearing a false front.”"
"迪布斯基耶涨得满脸通红。他的假顶发已经离他的脑壳有十几英寸远了。科尔蒙小姐抬起眼睛，看到了那光秃的头顶，羞得垂下了眼皮。迪布斯基耶狠狠地瞪了骑士一眼，那目光比癞蛤蟆盯着自己的猎物还更加狠毒。","Du Bousquier blushed.The false front was hanging half a dozen inches from his skull.Mademoiselle Cormon raised her eyes, saw that skull in all its nudity, and lowered them, abashed.Du Bousquier cast upon the chevalier the most venomous look that toad ever darted on its prey."
"“鄙视我的贵族走狗，”他心想，“我终有一天会把你们粉碎的。”","“Dogs of aristocrats who despise me,” thought he, “I’ll crush you some day.”"
"骑士以为自己又恢复了优势。但是科尔蒙小姐不是那样的女人，她不懂得骑士的祝愿和假顶发之间有什么关联。而且，就算她能明白，她的话已出口，她的手也不再属于他了。德瓦卢瓦骑士立即明白一切都完了。这个天真的老姑娘，看到眼前两人都默默不语，于是认为她应该有责任让他们开心一下。","The chevalier thought he had recovered his advantage.But Mademoiselle Cormon was not a woman to understand the connection which the chevalier intimated between his congratulatory wish and the false front.Besides, even if she had comprehended it, her word was passed, her hand given.Monsieur de Valois saw at once that all was lost.The innocent woman, with the two now silent men before her, wished, true to her sense of duty, to amuse them."
"“要不一起玩皮克牌吧？”她天真而毫无恶意地说道。","“Why not play a game of piquet together?” she said artlessly, without the slightest malice."
"迪布斯基耶微微一笑，然后作为家中未来的主人，走去搬牌桌了。德瓦卢瓦骑士，也许是昏了头，也许是想留下来以便研究他灾难的原因并设法补救，总之，他就像人们牵到屠宰场去的绵羊一样，任人摆布。他受到了一个男人所能受的最沉重的打击，任何一位绅士都至少会被打击得丧失理智的。","Du Bousquier smiled, and went, as the future master of the house, to fetch the piquet table.Whether the Chevalier de Valois lost his head, or whether he wanted to stay and study the causes of his disaster and remedy it, certain it is that he allowed himself to be led like a lamb to the slaughter.He had received the most violent knock-down blow that ever struck a man; any nobleman would have lost his senses for less."
"不一会儿，德斯蓬德神父和德特雷维尔子爵回来了。科尔蒙小姐立即起身，跑到前厅去，将她的舅舅拉到一旁，好告诉他她的决定。得知德特雷维尔先生很中意天鹅街的房子时，她便请自己的未婚夫来帮忙，告诉对方她舅父本来就知道这房子是要出售的。她不敢让神父去撒这个谎，因为他总是心不在焉的。总之，这谎编织的比美德还成功。到了晚上，全城都得知了这个重大消息。这四天以来，这城市的人忙碌得就像在一八一四年和一八一五年那些不幸的日子中一样。有些人讥讽嘲笑，有些人相信这桩婚事。有些人谴责这桩婚事，有些人看好这桩婚事。阿郎松的中产阶级为此兴高采烈，认为这是一种胜利。第二天，在朋友们面前，德瓦卢瓦骑士说了一句很刻薄的话：","The Abbe de Sponde and the Vicomte de Troisville soon returned.Mademoiselle Cormon instantly rose, hurried into the antechamber, and took her uncle apart to tell him her resolution.Learning that the house in the rue du Cygne exactly suited the viscount, she begged her future husband to do her the kindness to tell him that her uncle knew it was for sale.She dared not confide that lie to the abbe, fearing his absent-mindedness.The lie, however, prospered better than if it had been a virtuous action.In the course of that evening all Alencon heard the news.For the last four days the town had had as much to think of as during the fatal days of 1814 and 1815.Some laughed; others admitted the marriage.These blamed it; those approved it.The middle classes of Alencon rejoiced; they regarded it as a victory.The next day, among friends, the Chevalier de Valois said a cruel thing:—"
"“科尔蒙家怎么兴起的，也怎么衰落。从总管到商人，不过一步之遥而已。”","“The Cormons end as they began; there’s only a hand’s breadth between a steward and a purveyor.”"
"第七章 其他影响","CHAPTER VII OTHER RESULTS"
"科尔蒙小选中了丈夫的事，深深地刺伤了阿塔纳斯·格朗松的心，但他丝毫没有流露出他内心的狂风暴雨。他得知这婚事的消息时，正在法院院长迪龙瑟雷家里，他的母亲在那里玩波士顿牌。格朗松太太从一面镜子里观察她的儿子，发现他脸色苍白；不过他从早上就那样了，因为他已经隐约听到了这件婚事的传言。","The news of Mademoiselle Cormon’s choice stabbed poor Athanase Granson to the heart; but he showed no outward sign of the terrible agitation within him.When he first heard of the marriage he was at the house of the chief-justice, du Ronceret, where his mother was playing boston.Madame Granson looked at her son in a mirror, and thought him pale; but he had been so all day, for a vague rumor of the matter had already reached him."
"科尔蒙小姐原本是阿塔纳斯赌上自己一生的一张牌，而灾难将要发生的冰冷预感已经牢牢地将他罩住。当心灵和想象将不幸放大，使之成了肩上或思想上难以承担的重负时，当怀抱已久的希望（这个希望如果实现，就连吞噬心肝的贪婪秃鹫也会满足）破灭时，当一个人虽然有力量，却对自己失去了信心，虽然有坚强的意志，但是对前途已经失去了信心的时候，这个人就要垮了。阿塔纳斯就是帝国教育的产物。这个皇帝信仰的宗教，从皇帝的宝座上一直渗透到军队最底层的队伍中和学校里的板凳上。阿塔纳斯一直瞪着迪龙瑟雷夫人的牌，那种痴呆的样子，很容易让人以为他满不在乎，甚至连格朗松太太自己也认为估计错了儿子的感情。阿塔纳斯表面上的不在乎倒可以解释为她的儿子拒绝为了这件婚事牺牲自己“自由派”的见解。“自由派”这个词是由亚历山大大帝创造出来的，我认为它起源于斯塔尔夫人，又通过邦雅曼·贡斯当传开的。","Mademoiselle Cormon was the card on which Athanase had staked his life; and the cold presentiment of a catastrophe was already upon him.When the soul and the imagination have magnified a misfortune and made it too heavy for the shoulders and the brain to bear; when a hope long cherished, the realization of which would pacify the vulture feeding on the heart, is balked, and the man has faith neither in himself, despite his powers, nor in the future, despite of the Divine power,—then that man is lost.Athanase was a fruit of the Imperial system of education.Fatality, the Emperor’s religion, had filtered down from the throne to the lowest ranks of the army and the benches of the lyceums.Athanase sat still, with his eyes fixed on Madame du Ronceret’s cards, in a stupor that might so well pass for indifference that Madame Granson herself was deceived about his feelings.This apparent unconcern explained her son’s refusal to make a sacrifice for this marriage of his LIBERAL opinions,—the term “liberal” having lately been created for the Emperor Alexander by, I think, Madame de Stael, through the lips of Benjamin Constant."
"自从这个不幸的晚上开始，这个年轻人总是到萨尔特河河边风景最优美的地方散步。这是萨尔特河的一处河岸，阿郎松的画家经常到这里取景作画。那里有风车，河水在草地中愉快地穿行。萨尔特河岸边生长着排列优美而茂盛的树木。虽然这里的地形很平坦，但仍然具有法国独具一格的特色。在法国，你的眼睛从来不会因东方光线强烈而疲劳，也不会为持续不断的浓雾而忧郁。这里是很荒僻的。在外省，没有人在意优美的景物，也许是大家都习以为常了，也许是他们的灵魂中都缺乏诗意。在外省，如果从某条林阴道，某个地方或某个散步场所可以看到优美的景色，那里一定是没有人去的地方。阿塔纳斯很喜欢这荒僻的地方，汩汩流水使之生机盎然，春日的阳光刚一绽出微笑，草地便复苏发绿。那些看到他坐在白杨树下的人，以及注意过他那茫然眼神的人，都会和格朗松太太说：","After that fatal evening the young man took to rambling among the picturesque regions of the Sarthe, the banks of which are much frequented by sketchers who come to Alencon for points of view.Windmills are there, and the river is gay in the meadows.The shores of the Sarthe are bordered with beautiful trees, well grouped.Though the landscape is flat, it is not without those modest graces which distinguish France, where the eye is never wearied by the brilliancy of Oriental skies, nor saddened by constant fog.The place is solitary.In the provinces no one pays much attention to a fine view, either because provincials are blases on the beauty around them, or because they have no poesy in their souls.If there exists in the provinces a mall, a promenade, a vantage-ground from which a fine view can be obtained, that is the point to which no one goes.Athanase was fond of this solitude, enlivened by the sparkling water, where the fields were the first to green under the earliest smiling of the springtide sun.Those persons who saw him sitting beneath a poplar, and who noticed the vacant eye which he turned to them, would say to Madame Granson:—"
"“您儿子有点儿不对劲呀。”","“Something is the matter with your son.”"
"“我知道他在干什么。”这位母亲会得意地回答道，言下之意是她的儿子正在酝酿一部伟大作品呢。","“I know what it is,” the mother would reply; hinting that he was meditating over some great work."
"阿塔纳斯不再参与政治，也不再有什么政见了。但是有几次他却显得很开心，因为和一些认为可以将全世界都辱骂一顿的人在一起，为讥讽别人而快活。这位年轻人，游离于各种思想和外省的各种享乐之外，很少有人会在意他，他压根不是个令人好奇的对象。如果有人会和他的母亲谈起他，完全是因为他母亲的缘故，而不是对他感兴趣。阿郎松没有一个人来同情他，没有一个女人、一个朋友来为他擦干眼泪，他的眼泪都洒入了萨尔特河。如果俊俏的苏珊从这里经过，他们的相逢会诞生多少新的不幸呀！他们是完全可能相爱的。事实上，苏珊确实到过这里。苏珊的野心是因为曾经听了一段不同寻常的艳史，让她孩童般的头脑着迷了。这段艳史是发生在摩尔旅店。一位美得像天使一般的巴黎女郎，接受了警察局的任务，去迷惑德蒙托郎侯爵，要让他爱上她（见《舒昂党人》）。就在他从莫尔塔涅远征归来的时候，这个女郎在摩尔旅店与他相遇，并且诱惑了他，让他爱上了自己，然后出卖了他。这神奇的力量，美貌对于男性产生的这种魅力，玛丽·德韦纳伊与德蒙托郎侯爵的整个故事都让苏珊着迷。从她懂事起，她就渴望长大，好玩弄男性。在她匆忙离开之后的几个月，她和一位艺术家穿过她的家乡一起到布列塔尼去。她想看看富热尔，因为德蒙托郎侯爵的艳遇就是在富热尔结束的。她还想走遍这个可悲可泣的战场，这场悲剧直到现在还很少为人所知，却充满了她那幼稚的头脑。另外，她还希望能体面地穿过阿郎松城而没有人能认出她来。她打算让她的母亲避开不幸，并且感情微妙地想给可怜的阿塔纳斯一笔钱。这笔钱在我们这个时代，对于一个天才来说，相当于中世纪时蕊贝卡给艾凡赫弄到的战马和盔甲。","Athanase no longer took part in politics: he ceased to have opinions; but he appeared at times quite gay,—gay with the satire of those who think to insult a whole world with their own individual scorn.This young man, outside of all the ideas and all the pleasures of the provinces, interested few persons; he was not even an object of curiosity.If persons spoke of him to his mother, it was for her sake, not his.There was not a single soul in Alencon that sympathized with his; not a woman, not a friend came near to dry his tears; they dropped into the Sarthe.If the gorgeous Suzanne had happened that way, how many young miseries might have been born of the meeting! For the two would surely have loved each other.She did come, however.Suzanne’s ambition was early excited by the tale of a strange adventure which had happened at the tavern of the More,—a tale which had taken possession of her childish brain.A Parisian woman, beautiful as the angels, was sent by Fouche to entangle the Marquis de Montauran, otherwise called “The Gars,” in a love-affair (see “The Chouans”).She met him at the tavern of the More on his return from an expedition to Mortagne; she cajoled him, made him love her, and then betrayed him.That fantastic power—the power of beauty over mankind; in fact, the whole story of Marie de Verneuil and the Gars—dazzled Suzanne; she longed to grow up in order to play upon men.Some months after her hasty departure she passed through her native town with an artist on his way to Brittany.She wanted to see Fougeres, where the adventure of the Marquis de Montauran culminated, and to stand upon the scene of that picturesque war, the tragedies of which, still so little known, had filled her childish mind.Besides this, she had a fancy to pass through Alencon so elegantly equipped that no one could recognize her; to put her mother above the reach of necessity, and also to send to poor Athanase, in a delicate manner, a sum of money,—which in our age is to genius what in the middle ages was the charger and the coat of mail that Rebecca conveyed to Ivanhoe."
"科尔蒙小姐的婚姻造成的莫名其妙的风云变幻持续了一个月。人们分成两派，一派不相信这桩婚姻，总是在一起否认这婚事；另一派则总是肯定这桩婚事。过了两周，怀疑派遭到了惨败：迪布斯基耶的房子卖给了德特雷维尔先生。这位先生只想在阿郎松有一所简朴的房子，因为日后赛布洛夫公主去世了，他还想搬到巴黎去住。他打算一边恢复自己的土地旧观，一面心平气和地等着他的遗产。看来是不会有错了。然而，怀疑派仍然不甘心。他们声称，不管迪布斯基耶是否要结婚，他都是做了一桩好买卖。他的房子最初只花了两万七千法郎。怀疑派这样不容质疑的见解，把相信派给震住了。怀疑派还说，舒瓦内尔，也就是科尔蒙小姐的公证人，确实还没有听到婚约的事。但是相信派仍然坚信不疑，到了第十二天，他们取得了胜利：自由党的公证人勒普雷索瓦先生到了科尔蒙小姐家中，并且签了婚约。","One month passed away in the strangest uncertainties respecting the marriage of Mademoiselle Cormon.A party of unbelievers denied the marriage altogether; the believers, on the other hand, affirmed it.At the end of two weeks, the faction of unbelief received a vigorous blow in the sale of du Bousquier’s house to the Marquis de Troisville, who only wanted a simple establishment in Alencon, intending to go to Paris after the death of the Princess Scherbellof; he proposed to await that inheritance in retirement, and then to reconstitute his estates.This seemed positive.The unbelievers, however, were not crushed.They declared that du Bousquier, married or not, had made an excellent sale, for the house had only cost him twenty-seven thousand francs.The believers were depressed by this practical observation of the incredulous.Choisnel, Mademoiselle Cormon’s notary, asserted the latter, had heard nothing about the marriage contract; but the believers, still firm in their faith, carried off, on the twentieth day, a signal victory: Monsieur Lepressoir, the notary of the liberals, went to Mademoiselle Cormon’s house, and the contract was signed."
"这是科尔蒙小姐为丈夫做出的头一件牺牲的事，以后还会有很多要她牺牲的事。迪布斯基耶恨透了舒瓦内尔。他认为阿芒德小姐第一次拒绝他，就是受舒瓦内尔的影响；而他认为，阿芒德小姐拒绝了他的求婚又导致了科尔蒙小姐第一次对他求婚的拒绝。婚事因为这一情况拖了下来。老姑娘还收到了几封匿名信。她吃惊地了解到，苏珊和她一样还是处女，因为那个戴假顶发、引诱少女的坏蛋迪布斯基耶和这类风流韵事从来沾不上边。科尔蒙小姐很讨厌这种匿名信，但是她还是本着阐明妇女协会的宗旨，给苏珊写了信。毫无疑问苏珊也得知了迪布斯基耶要结婚的事，在回信中承认了自己玩的花招，给协会寄回了一千法郎，同时在信中对迪布斯基耶大肆诋毁。科尔蒙小姐召集妇女协会成员，举办了一次特别会议，决定以后协会不再救济将要发生的不幸，但是只救济那些已经发生的不幸。","This was the first of the numerous sacrifices which Mademoiselle Cormon was destined to make to her husband.Du Bousquier bore the deepest hatred to Choisnel; to him he owed the refusal of the hand of Mademoiselle Armande,—a refusal which, as he believed, had influenced that of Mademoiselle Cormon.This circumstance alone made the marriage drag along.Mademoiselle received several anonymous letters.She learned, to her great astonishment, that Suzanne was as truly a virgin as herself so far as du Bousquier was concerned, for that seducer with the false toupet could never be the hero of any such adventure.Mademoiselle Cormon disdained anonymous letters; but she wrote to Suzanne herself, on the ground of enlightening the Maternity Society.Suzanne, who had no doubt heard of du Bousquier’s proposed marriage, acknowledged her trick, sent a thousand francs to the society, and did all the harm she could to the old purveyor.Mademoiselle Cormon convoked the Maternity Society, which held a special meeting at which it was voted that the association would not in future assist any misfortunes about to happen, but solely those that had happened."
"这些事件又成为了全城风言风语的中心话题，但是在教堂和市政府门前还是贴出了结婚预告。阿塔纳斯为他们安排了这些事宜。为了安全和礼节，未婚妻到普雷博戴去住了；而迪布斯基耶每天早上带着十分难看但很奢华的花束，早出晚归，回城吃晚饭。","In spite of all these various events which kept the town in the choicest gossip, the banns were published in the churches and at the mayor’s office.Athanase prepared the deeds.As a matter of propriety and public decency, the bride retired to Prebaudet, where du Bousquier, bearing sumptuous and horrible bouquets, betook himself every morning, returning home for dinner."
"最后，在六月的一个多雨而阴沉的上午，当着全城人的面，科尔蒙小姐和迪布斯基耶先生的婚礼于中午时分在阿郎松教区举行了。这对新人从家到市政府，从市政府到教堂，坐的是一辆豪华的敞篷四轮马车。这辆马车是迪布斯基耶悄悄从巴黎弄来的。那辆旧马车被丢弃了，对于全城的人来说无异于一大灾难。赛镇门的鞍具商大嚷大叫，因为他每年修理那马车可以赚到五十法郎，这下是没有了。阿郎松的人满怀恐惧地看到，奢侈品可能因此而进入这个城市。每个人都担心物价会上涨，房租会提高，巴黎的家具会入侵这里的市场。有人好奇心特别强，愿意给雅克兰十个苏，好让他们就近仔细瞧瞧这辆可能会引起当地经济危机的敞篷四轮马车。从诺曼底买来的两匹马也够骇人的了。","At last, on a dull and rainy morning in June, the marriage of Mademoiselle Cormon and the Sieur du Bousquier took place at noon in the parish church of Alencon, in sight of the whole town.The bridal pair went from their own house to the mayor’s office, and from the mayor’s office to the church in an open caleche, a magnificent vehicle for Alencon, which du Bousquier had sent for secretly to Paris.The loss of the old carriole was a species of calamity in the eyes of the community.The harness-maker of the Porte de Seez bemoaned it, for he lost the fifty francs a year which it cost in repairs.Alencon saw with alarm the possibility of luxury being thus introduced into the town.Every one feared a rise in the price of rents and provisions, and a coming invasion of Parisian furniture.Some persons were sufficiently pricked by curiosity to give ten sous to Jacquelin to allow them a close inspection of the vehicle which threatened to upset the whole economy of the region.A pair of horses, bought in Normandie, were also most alarming."
"“我们要是也买这样的马，”迪龙瑟雷商号的人说，“再也别想把它们卖出去了。”","“If we bought our own horses,” said the Ronceret circle, “we couldn’t sell them to those who come to buy.”"
"虽然这种看法很愚昧，但是从防止当地囤积外来金钱这个意义上看，还是很有远见的。在外省看来，各地的财富不是表现在金钱的积极周转上，而是看有多少固定不动的积蓄。在这里应该要提一下，珀涅罗珀在小姐结婚六周前得了胸膜炎，怎么也治不好，死了。","Stupid as it was, this reasoning seemed sound; for surely such a course would prevent the region from grasping the money of foreigners.In the eyes of the provinces wealth consisted less in the rapid turning over of money than in sterile accumulation.It may be mentioned here that Penelope succumbed to a pleurisy which she acquired about six weeks before the marriage; nothing could save her."
"格朗松太太、玛丽埃特、迪库徳赖夫人、迪龙瑟雷夫人以及全城的人都注意到，迪布斯基耶夫人走进教堂时，先迈的是左脚！“左”这个字眼当时具有政治意义，因此更让人觉得是个凶兆。另外，负责念誓词的教士很偶然地一翻开书便翻到了哀悼经的地方。因此这桩婚事从头到尾就这样一直伴随着种种注定倒霉、令人惊心动魄的情况，没有一个人说是吉兆。事实上，情况越来越糟糕。根本没有举行婚礼，因为新婚夫妇立即前往普雷博戴去了。大家都说，巴黎的风俗要压倒外省历史悠久的习俗了。","Madame Granson, Mariette, Madame du Coudrai, Madame du Ronceret, and through them the whole town, remarked that Madame du Bousquier entered the church WITH HER LEFT FOOT,—an omen all the more dreadful because the term Left was beginning to acquire a political meaning.The priest whose duty it was to read the opening formula opened his book by chance at the De Profundis.Thus the marriage was accompanied by circumstances so fateful, so alarming, so annihilating that no one dared to augur well of it.Matters, in fact, went from bad to worse.There was no wedding party; the married pair departed immediately for Prebaudet.Parisian customs, said the community, were about to triumph over time-honored provincial ways."
"玛丽埃特和雅克兰现在终于成婚了，他们的婚礼倒举行得很愉快。阿郎松也就他们俩会驳斥那些关于他们女主人婚姻的不吉利的预言了。","The marriage of Jacquelin and Josette now took place: it was gay; and they were the only two persons in Alencon who refuted the sinister prophecies relating to the marriage of their mistress."
"迪布斯基耶打算把他卖房子的钱来修葺科尔蒙公馆，并且将这栋房子现代化。他决定在普雷博戴过上半年，把德斯蓬德舅舅也带去了。这消息惊恐了整座城的人，每个人都感觉到，迪布斯基耶就要把这个城市带到追求舒适的邪路上去。一天早上，阿郎松人看见这新郎坐着一辆轻便双轮马车从普雷博戴来到瓦诺布勒监督施工，车上又套了一匹新买的马，他旁边坐的是穿着仆人号衣的勒内。这更增加了城里人的恐惧情绪。他管理财产的第一举动，便是将他妻子的全部积蓄以公债形式存入国库，当时的报价是67.5法郎。一年之内他不停地做交易，后来他的个人财富达到了几乎和他妻子的财富相当的程度。","Du Bousquier determined to use the proceeds of the sale of his late residence in restoring and modernizing the hotel Cormon.He decided to remain through two seasons at Prebaudet, and took the Abbe de Sponde with them.This news spread terror through the town, where every individual felt that du Bousquier was about to drag the community into the fatal path of “comfort.”This fear increased when the inhabitants of Alencon saw the bridegroom driving in from Prebaudet one morning to inspect his works, in a fine tilbury drawn by a new horse, having Rene at his side in livery.The first act of his administration had been to place his wife’s savings on the Grand-Livre, which was then quoted at 67 fr. 50 cent.In the space of one year, during which he played constantly for a rise, he made himself a personal fortune almost as considerable as that of his wife."
"可是，有件与这婚事相关联的祸事，让这桩婚事显得更加不吉利了，把之前那些凶兆和扰乱人心的革新举动都比下去了。","But all these foreboding prophecies, these perturbing innovations, were superseded and surpassed by an event connected with this marriage which gave a still more fatal aspect to it."
"在他们举行婚礼的当天晚上，阿塔纳斯和他妈妈吃过晚饭，仆人像往常一样在上餐后甜点时用细树枝生了一点火，他们就坐在火炉旁。","On the very evening of the ceremony, Athanase and his mother were sitting, after their dinner, over a little fire of fagots, which the servant lighted usually at dessert."
"“好吧，既然现在没有科尔蒙小姐了，我们今晚去迪龙瑟雷院长家去吧，”格朗松太太说，","“Well, we will go this evening to the du Roncerets’, inasmuch as we have lost Mademoiselle Cormon,” said Madame Granson."
"“天哪！我永远不会习惯管她叫迪布斯基耶夫人的。这个称呼真让我觉得别扭。”阿塔纳斯神情抑郁地望了母亲一眼，他再也笑不出来了。他产生了一个天真的念头，这个念头能抚慰他的创伤，却医治不了他的痛苦。他倒不排斥这个念头。","“Heavens! How shall I ever accustom myself to call her Madame du Bousquier! That name burns my lips.”Athanase looked at his mother with a constrained and melancholy air; he could not smile; but he seemed to wish to welcome that naive sentiment which soothed his wound, though it could not cure his anguish."
"“妈妈，”他像孩子一样温柔地喊道，他已经多年不用这个称呼了，“我亲爱的妈妈，我们先不要出门吧；在火炉前坐着多舒服呀。”","“Mamma,” he said, in the voice of his childhood, so tender was it, and using the name he had abandoned for several years,—“my dear mamma, do not let us go out just yet; it is so pleasant here before the fire.”"
"这位母亲听见了，却没有理解这是一个忍受着致命痛苦的人发出的最后祈求。","The mother heard, without comprehending, that supreme prayer of a mortal sorrow."
"“好吧，我们再呆会儿吧，孩子，”她说，“比起玩波士顿还可能输钱，我当然更愿意和你聊天，听听你的计划。”","“Yes, let us stay, my child,” she said.“I like much better to talk with you and listen to your projects than to play at boston and lose my money.”"
"“你今晚真漂亮，我喜欢看着你。而且，我现在很多想法都和这可怜的小客厅融合在一起了。我们在这儿受了太多苦了。”","“You are so handsome to-night I love to look at you.Besides, I am in a current of ideas which harmonize with this poor little salon where we have suffered so much.”"
"“而且我们今后还要受苦，我可怜的阿塔纳斯，一直要等到你的作品获得成功。我倒没有关系，穷惯了；可是你，我的宝贝！眼看着你的青春年华逝去，毫无快乐！我可怜的孩子生活里只有艰辛的工作！一个母亲一想到这些就很难过呀，这些事晚上折磨我，早上又把我惊醒。哦，上帝呀！我做错了什么？因为什么罪过你要这样惩罚我呀？”她离开自己的沙发，搬了一张小椅子，坐在阿塔纳斯身边，好把她的头依偎在她孩子的胸前。真正的母爱总是有让人动情之处。阿塔纳斯亲吻了母亲的眼睛，亲吻了母亲花白的头发，亲吻了母亲的前额，怀着一份神圣的意愿，要在凡是嘴唇能接触的地方，都留下自己的感情。","“And where we shall still suffer, my poor Athanase, until your works succeed.For myself, I am trained to poverty; but you, my treasure! To see your youth go by without a joy! Nothing but toil for my poor boy in life!That thought is like an illness to a mother; it tortures me at night; it wakes me in the morning.O God! What have I done? For what crime dost thou punish me for thus?”She left her sofa, took a little chair, and sat close to Athanase, so as to lay her head on the bosom of her child.There is always the grace of love in true motherhood.Athanase kissed her on the eyes, on her gray hair, on her forehead, with the sacred desire of laying his soul wherever he applied his lips."
"“我永远不会成功的。”他说道，极力地要瞒住母亲他脑中正在做出的一个致命决定。","“I shall never succeed,” he said, trying to deceive his mother as to the fatal resolution he was revolving in his mind."
"“哎呀！不要灰心啊。正如你经常说的，思想可以成就一切。只要十大瓶墨水，十令纸，加上顽强的意志，路德把整个欧洲都颠覆了。好了，你会出名的；你用同样的手段来行善，而他却用来作恶。你不是这样说过的吗？你看我一直都认真听你说的话，我比你想得还更理解你呢。因为我觉得我还在腹中怀着你，你的任何想法都会对我产生影响，就像曾经你轻轻一动，都会在我腹中引起反应一样。”","“Pooh! Don’t get discouraged.As you often say, thought can do all things.With ten bottles of ink, ten reams of paper, and his powerful will, Luther upset all Europe.Well, you’ll make yourself famous; you will do good things by the same means which he used to do evil things.Haven’t you said so yourself?For my part, I listen to you; I understand you a great deal more than you think I do,—for I still bear you in my bosom, and your every thought still stirs me as your slightest motion did in other days.”"
"“我在这儿永远不会成功的，妈妈；我不想让你看到我的挣扎，我的不幸，我的痛苦。啊，母亲，您让我离开阿郎松吧！我想到远离您的地方去受苦。”","“I shall never succeed here, mamma; and I don’t want you to witness the sight of my struggles, my misery, my anguish.Oh, mother, let me leave Alencon!I want to suffer away from you.”"
"“我愿意呆在你的身边，”母亲骄傲地说，“没有母亲陪着你受苦怎么行呢！必要的话，你可怜的母亲可以当你的女仆；你要求的话，你可怜的母亲会躲起来而不会伤害你；你的母亲永远不会让你感到羞愧。不，不，阿塔纳斯，我们一定不能分离。”","“And I wish to be at your side,” replied his mother, proudly.“Suffer without your mother!—that poor mother who would be your servant if necessary; who will efface herself rather than injure you; your mother, who will never shame you.No, no, Athanase; we must not part.”"
"阿塔纳斯以一个垂死之人拥抱生命的热情拥抱了他的母亲。","Athanase clung to his mother with the ardor of a dying man who clings to life."
"“尽管如此，我还是想要走。否则，你就会失去我；这双重的痛苦，你的痛苦和我的痛苦，会折磨死我的。你总希望我活着的吧？”","“But I wish it, nevertheless.If not, you will lose me; this double grief, yours and mine, is killing me.You would rather I lived than died?”"
"格朗松太太神色惊慌地看着儿子。","Madame Granson looked at her son with a haggard eye."
"“这就是你心里一直在想的吗？”她说，“看来别人说的是对的。你真的要走吗？”","“So this is what you have been brooding?” she said.“They told me right.Do you really mean to go?”"
"“是的。”","“Yes.”"
"“你不会不和我说明白、不和我打招呼就走吧。你也必须要带上衣服和钱才能走呀。我还有几个金路易缝在我的衬裙里，我把它们给你。”","“You will not go without telling me; without warning me?You must have an outfit and money.I have some louis sewn into my petticoat; I shall give them to you.”"
"阿塔纳斯哭了。","Athanase wept."
"“这就是我要对你说的话，”他说，“我现在送你到法院院长家去吧。走吧。”","“That’s all I wanted to tell you,” he said.“Now I’ll take you to the du Roncerets’.Come.”"
"母子二人出门了。阿塔纳斯送母亲到了那户人家的门口，她打算在那里打发晚上的时间。他紧紧靠在墙上，久久望着百叶窗缝里透出来的灯光。一会儿，他听到他妈妈说“他拥有极其独立”，他感到一阵莫名的狂喜。","The mother and the son went out.Athanase left his mother at the door of the house where she intended to pass the evening.He looked long at the light which came through the shutters; he clung closely to the wall, and a frenzied joy came over him when he presently heard his mother say, “He has great independence of heart.”"
"“可怜的母亲！我骗了她。”他走到萨尔特河边时，大喊道。","“Poor mother!I have deceived her,” he cried, as he made his way to the Sarthe."
"他走到了那棵美丽的白杨树下，在过去的四十天里，他在这里思考了多少问题呀！他还搬来了两块大石头，以便坐在上面。他欣赏了明媚的月光映照下的自然美景；他再次重温了他所渴望的全部的辉煌未来；他走过为他的名字所轰动的城市；他听到人们热烈的掌声；他呼吸着自己名望的气息；他热爱自己梦寐以求的一生；他兴高采烈地向辉煌的胜利奔去；他为自己树立了雕像；他忆起了自己全部的幻想，好在最后一次奥林匹斯诸神宴会上向它们告别。这种魔法曾一度是可能的，但是现在永远失效了。在这最后的时刻，他紧紧抱住那棵美丽的大树，他一直把它当作朋友一样来迷恋。然后他把两块石头分别装进大衣的口袋里，并且扣好胸口的衣扣。他故意出门不戴帽子。现在他走向他早已选定的深水处，坚定地走进水中，尽量不弄出声响，而事实上几乎没有什么声响。","He reached the noble poplar beneath which he had meditated so much for the last forty days, and where he had placed two heavy stones on which he now sat down.He contemplated that beautiful nature lighted by the moon; he reviewed once more the glorious future he had longed for; he passed through towns that were stirred by his name; he heard the applauding crowds; he breathed the incense of his fame; he adored that life long dreamed of; radiant, he sprang to radiant triumphs; he raised his stature; he evoked his illusions to bid them farewell in a last Olympic feast.The magic had been potent for a moment; but now it vanished forever.In that awful hour he clung to the beautiful tree to which, as to a friend, he had attached himself; then he put the two stones into the pockets of his overcoat, which he buttoned across his breast.He had come intentionally without a hat.He now went to the deep pool he had long selected, and glided into it resolutely, trying to make as little noise as possible, and, in fact, making scarcely any."
"九点半左右，格朗松太太回到家，仆人没有提到阿塔纳斯，不过交给她一封信。她打开信，看到上面写着短短几句话：","When, at half-past nine o’clock, Madame Granson returned home, her servant said nothing of Athanase, but gave her a letter.She opened it and read these few words,—"
"“亲爱的母亲，我走了，不要责怪我吧。”","“My good mother, I have departed; don’t be angry with me.”"
"“他怎么能这样对我！”她想道，“他的衣服！还有钱呢！","“A pretty trick he has played me!” she thought.“And his linen! and the money!"
"好吧，他会给我写信的，到时我再去找他。这些可怜的孩子，总以为自己会比他们的爸妈聪明。”","Well, he will write to me, and then I’ll follow him.These poor children think they are so much cleverer than their fathers and mothers.”"
"于是她安心地去睡觉了。","And she went to bed in peace."
"次日早上，萨尔特河如渔夫们预料的一样涨水了。涨水时会把鳗鱼从河的泥沟里给卷了出来。一个渔夫撒网，碰巧撒在可怜的阿塔纳斯跳进去的地方。阿塔纳斯还以为别人永远找不到他呢。清晨六点钟，渔夫用网将这年轻人的尸体拖了回来。这位可怜的母亲的两三位好友小心谨慎地采取各种方法，以便让她有点思想准备来面对这可怕的遗体。可以想见，这一自杀事件在阿郎松引起了极大的反响。这可怜的年轻人前一晚还没有一个保护人，但在他死后的第二天，千百个声音在大喊说：“我本来可以帮帮他的。”白送人情的假慈悲，可以很容易又方便地装出来!","During the preceding morning the Sarthe had risen to a height foreseen by the fisherman.These sudden rises of muddy water brought eels from their various runlets.It so happened that a fisherman had spread his net at the very place where poor Athanase had flung himself, believing that no one would ever find him.About six o’clock in the morning the man drew in his net, and with it the young body.The few friends of the poor mother took every precaution in preparing her to receive the dreadful remains.The news of this suicide made, as may well be supposed, a great excitement in Alencon.The poor young man of genius had no protector the night before, but on the morrow of his death a thousand voices cried aloud, “I would have helped him.”It is so easy and convenient to be charitable gratis!"
"德瓦卢瓦骑士解释了这一自杀事件。他怀着报复的想法，揭示了阿塔纳斯对科尔蒙小姐怀着多么天真、诚挚而又美好的爱情。格朗松太太受到骑士的提醒，记起了千百件小事，证明骑士说的都是真的。于是这成了很凄婉感人的故事，很多女人都为之洒泪。格朗松太太的悲痛并不外露，而是集中在自己心里，很少有人能够理解。丧子的母亲有两种悲痛方式。通常，世人完全明白她们损失的是什么：她们的儿子平时受人器重，受人赏识，年轻或者俊朗，有着前途无量的未来，会成为大富翁，也有可能成名。他的去世让人普遍感到惋惜，世人会分担这悲哀，在扩大哀痛的同时也减轻了母亲的哀痛。但还有一种情况，只有母亲才真正了解自己的孩子，只有母亲才看到过儿子的微笑，只有母亲才知道这个夭折的生命中蕴藏着什么珍宝。这种痛苦常把它的悲伤隐藏起来，但是悲伤的黑色却使其他的丧事都黯然失色。这种哀痛很难用语言形容，所幸遭受此种痛苦的女性很少。","The suicide was explained by the Chevalier de Valois.He revealed, in a spirit of revenge, the artless, sincere, and genuine love of Athanase for Mademoiselle Cormon.Madame Granson, enlightened by the chevalier, remembered a thousand little circumstances which confirmed the chevalier’s statement.The story then became touching, and many women wept over it.Madame Granson’s grief was silent, concentrated, and little understood.There are two forms of mourning for mothers.Often the world can enter fully into the nature of their loss: their son, admired, appreciated, young, perhaps handsome, with a noble path before him, leading to fortune, possibly to fame, excites universal regret; society joins in the grief, and alleviates while it magnifies it.But there is another sorrow of mothers who alone know what their child was really; who alone have received his smiles and observed the treasures of a life too soon cut short.That sorrow hides its woe, the blackness of which surpasses all other mourning; it cannot be described; happily there are but few women whose heart-strings are thus severed."
"迪布斯基耶夫人回城以前，就有一位好友，迪龙瑟雷法院院长的太太到普雷博戴去，将这具尸体扔到她欢乐的玫瑰花上，告诉她她曾经忽视了的爱情，并且温柔地在她新婚蜜月的蜂蜜上撒上了千百滴苦艾酒。迪布斯基耶夫人回到阿郎松后，在瓦诺布勒街拐角上碰见了格朗松太太。那位母亲哀莫大于心死的目光刺在了这可怜的女人的心上。那目光凝聚了千种诅咒、万种斥责，那目光向她预言了不幸，并且召唤着不幸降临到她身上，把迪布斯基耶夫人吓坏了。","Before Madame du Bousquier returned to town, Madame du Ronceret, one of her good friends, had driven out to Prebaudet to fling this corpse upon the roses of her joy, to show her the love she had ignored, and sweetly shed a thousand drops of wormwood into the honey of her bridal month.As Madame du Bousquier drove back to Alencon, she chanced to meet Madame Granson at the corner of the rue Val-Noble.The glance of the mother, dying of her grief, struck to the heart of the poor woman.A thousand maledictions, a thousand flaming reproaches, were in that look: Madame du Bousquier was horror-struck; that glance predicted and called down evil upon her head."
"格朗松太太是最反对这座城市里的神父的人之一，她一直支持圣莱奥纳尔教堂的牧师。灾难降临后的第二天晚上，当她想到自己一派一向宣扬的不可改变的天主教教义时，就开始浑身发抖。她心中想着救世主的母亲，亲手将儿子的尸体用裹尸布裹好，然后怀着忐忑不安的沉重心情走到她一直憎恨的那位神父家里去。她看见这位清贫的教士正在外屋里忙着储存大麻和亚麻，准备交给城里所有贫苦的女人们，将麻纺成线，以免她们没有活干。这种慈善的举动拯救了许多无法沿街乞讨的贫苦之人。神父见到格朗松太太，急忙放下活，领着格朗松太太到饭厅里坐下。这位不幸的母亲看到神父的晚餐，知道他也过着和自己一样节俭的生活。","The evening after the catastrophe, Madame Granson, one of the persons most opposed to the rector of the town, and who had hitherto supported the minister of Saint-Leonard, began to tremble as she thought of the inflexible Catholic doctrines professed by her own party.After placing her son’s body in its shroud with her own hands, thinking of the mother of the Saviour, she went, with a soul convulsed by anguish, to the house of the hated rector.There she found the modest priest in an outer room, engaged in putting away the flax and yarns with which he supplied poor women, in order that they might never be wholly out of work,—a form of charity which saved many who were incapable of begging from actual penury.The rector left his yarns and hastened to take Madame Granson into his dining-room, where the wretched mother noticed, as she looked at his supper, the frugal method of his own living."
"“教士先生，”她说，“我来这儿是要恳求您——”她泣不成声，说不下去了。","“Monsieur l’abbe,” she said, “I have come to implore you—” She burst into tears, unable to continue."
"“我知道您来是为了什么事，”教士回答道，“太太，我相信您和您的亲戚迪布斯基耶夫人，可以使赛镇主教在这个问题上不予以追究。对，我一定为您可怜的孩子祈祷；是的，我会为他作弥撒。但是我们一定要避免任何的闲言闲语，不给机会让城里的恶人聚到教堂里来。只有我一个人，不要别的教士，在晚上——”","“I know what brings you,” replied the saintly man.“I must trust to you, madame, and to your relation, Madame du Bousquier, to pacify Monseigneur the Bishop at Seez.Yes, I will pray for your unhappy child; yes, I will say the masses.But we must avoid all scandal, and give no opportunity for evil-judging persons to assemble in the church.I alone, without other clergy, at night—”"
"“好，好，由您安排，只要能让他踏上圣土就好。”可怜的母亲拉着教士的手亲吻着说道。","“Yes, yes, as you think best; if only he may lie in consecrated ground,” said the poor mother, taking the priest’s hand and kissing it."
"在午夜时分，阿塔纳斯生前最喜欢的四位年轻人悄悄地抬着棺材来到郊区。在那里有几位格朗松太太的女友，都穿着黑衣，戴着面纱；还有几位年轻人，也曾与这位死去的才子交往密切。棺材上罩着黑纱，上面点着四只大蜡烛。在一位嘴很严实的唱诗班孩子的协助下，教士做了追思弥撒。然后，人们无声地将自杀者的棺材抬到了墓地的一角。那里竖着一个发黑了的木头十字架，没有墓志，作用就是告诉母亲，这里以后就是死者的位置了。阿塔纳斯生前不被人关注，死后也不引人注目。没有人责备神父，主教也对此保持沉默。母亲的虔诚补救了儿子自杀的大不敬行为。","Toward midnight a coffin was clandestinely borne to the parish church by four young men, comrades whom Athanase had liked the best.A few friends of Madame Granson, women dressed in black, and veiled, were present; and half a dozen other young men who had been somewhat intimate with this lost genius.Four torches flickered on the coffin, which was covered with crape.The rector, assisted by one discreet choirboy, said the mortuary mass.Then the body of the suicide was noiselessly carried to a corner of the cemetery, where a black wooden cross, without inscription, was all that indicated its place hereafter to the mother.Athanase lived and died in shadow.No voice was raised to blame the rector; the bishop kept silence.The piety of the mother redeemed the impiety of the son’s last act."
"几个月后，这可怜的女人，痛苦得几乎精神失常，像不幸的人渴望把嘴唇探进他们的苦杯中一样，决定要去看看儿子投水自尽的地方。也许是她的本能告诉她，在那株白杨树下，还能勾起对儿子的思念；也许是她渴望能看看儿子生前最后一次看见的景物。有的母亲会触景伤情地死去，而有的母亲会沉湎于圣洁的爱慕之情中。对于有些事情，教育、法律和哲学体系都是说不通的，耐心的人性分析学者自然也不能确切地说明这样的事情。我们可以反复说：想把人的感情归入一种模式是很荒谬的。感情到了每一个人身上，都会与其自身特有的素质相结合，形成独特的形式。","Some months later, the poor woman, half beside herself with grief, and moved by one of those inexplicable thirsts which misery feels to steep its lips in the bitter chalice, determined to see the spot where her son was drowned.Her instinct may have told her that thoughts of his could be recovered beneath that poplar; perhaps, too, she desired to see what his eyes had seen for the last time.Some mothers would die of the sight; others give themselves up to it in saintly adoration.Patient anatomists of human nature cannot too often enunciate the truths before which all educations, laws, and philosophical systems must give way.Let us repeat continually: it is absurd to force sentiments into one formula: appearing as they do, in each individual man, they combine with the elements that form his nature and take his own physiognomy."
"格朗松太太来到了阿塔纳斯丧命的地方，看见一个女子走过来，大声说道：","Madame Granson, as she stood on that fatal spot, saw a woman approach it, who exclaimed,—"
"“是这里吗？”","“Was it here?”"
"那女人和这位母亲一样泣不成声。她就是苏珊。抵达摩尔旅店时，苏珊就得知了这件祸事。如果可怜的阿塔纳斯还活着，她会做出许多心灵高尚却身无分文之人幻想做的事，也是富人从未想过的事：她会给他寄上几千法郎，信封上会写着：“此为一同伴所欠令尊之款，现特奉还与你。”这是苏珊在旅途中便已想好了的。","That woman wept as the mother wept.It was Suzanne.Arriving that morning at the hotel du More, she had been told of the catastrophe.If poor Athanase had been living, she meant to do as many noble souls, who are moneyless, dream of doing, and as the rich never think of doing,—she meant to have sent him several thousand francs, writing up the envelope the words: “Money due to your father from a comrade who makes restitution to you.”This tender scheme had been arranged by Suzanne during her journey."
"这个交际花远远望见格朗松太太便匆匆离去，走过她身边时低声说：“我是爱过他的！”","The courtesan caught sight of Madame Granson and moved rapidly away, whispering as she passed her, “I loved him!”"
"苏珊始终本性不改，她不把新娘头上的橙花变成睡莲花，是不会离开阿郎松城的。她是第一个扬言说，迪布斯基耶夫人将永远都只是科尔蒙小姐。她这一席恶言恶语算是为阿塔纳斯和亲爱的骑士报仇了。","Suzanne, faithful to her nature, did not leave Alencon on this occasion without changing the orange-blossoms of the bride to rue.She was the first to declare that Madame du Bousquier would never be anything but Mademoiselle Cormon.With one stab of her tongue she revenged poor Athanase and her dear chevalier."
"社交界很快就忘记了他们当中死去的人，阿塔纳斯确实很快就被人们遗忘了。现在阿郎松城又在亲眼目睹另一桩性质不同于阿塔纳斯的可怜的慢性自杀。可怜的德瓦卢瓦骑士每天虽生犹死，他这十四年的生活都是在自杀。迪布斯基耶结婚三个月后，大家都惊讶地发现，骑士的衬衣变成了橙黄色，头发也不怎么梳理了。现在他已是蓬头垢面，从前的德瓦卢瓦骑士不复存在了。他的几颗象牙色的牙齿不见了，即使善于观察的人也不能发现那几颗牙齿到底是属于哪里的。是外部的还是自身的，植物性的还是动物性的，是年龄大了掉了，还是骑士将牙齿忘在他梳妆台的抽屉里了。他的领结也打歪了，完全不优雅了。黑人头耳环由于尘土和油脂而变得发白。骑士脸上的皱纹成了深沟，愈发黑了，皮肤也成了羊皮纸一般。那些经常被忽视的指甲，天哪！经常可以看到镶了一道黑丝绒的边。","Alencon now witnessed a suicide that was slower and quite differently pitiful from that of poor Athanase, who was quickly forgotten by society, which always makes haste to forget its dead.The poor Chevalier de Valois died in life; his suicide was a daily occurrence for fourteen years.Three months after the du Bousquier marriage society remarked, not without astonishment, that the linen of the chevalier was frayed and rusty, that his hair was irregularly combed and brushed.With a frowsy head the Chevalier de Valois could no longer be said to exist!A few of his ivory teeth deserted, though the keenest observers of human life were unable to discover to what body they had hitherto belonged, whether to a foreign legion or whether they were indigenous, vegetable or animal; whether age had pulled them from the chevalier’s mouth, or whether they were left forgotten in the drawer of his dressing-table.The cravat was crooked, indifferent to elegance.The negroes’ heads grew pale with dust and grease.The wrinkles of the face were blackened and puckered; the skin became parchment.The nails, neglected, were often seen, alas! with a black velvet edging."
"马甲上一条条没有擦掉的鼻涕就挂在那里，好像秋天的落叶一般。耳朵里的棉花也是难得换一次。忧伤停在他的额头上，将黄色注入每条皱纹的深沟里。总之，透过这栋漂亮的建筑物的千疮百孔，从前被十分巧妙地遮掩住的废墟，现在已经一览无遗，这足以说明人的精神力量对身体的影响有多大。一旦希望破灭，曾经的金发美男子、骑士、青春少年都死亡了。在那以前，骑士的鼻子一直是很优雅的，从没有出现过鼻屎或是流过鼻涕。可是现在，鼻烟蔓延到了鼻孔下面，到处都是；鼻涕利用嘴巴上面的天然滴水管流下来，非常不雅——这个鼻子再也不在乎是否显得可爱了。可见骑士从前对自己的外表是多么讲究呀，人们也可以从中了解到，他对科尔蒙小姐是多么用心良苦，投入了多大的毅力。","The waistcoat was tracked and stained with droppings which spread upon its surface like autumn leaves.The cotton in the ears was seldom changed.Sadness reigned upon that brow, and slipped its yellowing tints into the depths of each furrow.In short, the ruins, hitherto so cleverly hidden, now showed through the cracks and crevices of that fine edifice, and proved the power of the soul over the body; for the fair and dainty man, the cavalier, the young blood, died when hope deserted him.Until then the nose of the chevalier was ever delicate and nice; never had a damp black blotch, nor an amber drop fall from it; but now that nose, smeared with tobacco around the nostrils, degraded by the driblets which took advantage of the natural gutter placed between itself and the upper lip,—that nose, which no longer cared to seem agreeable, revealed the infinite pains which the chevalier had formerly taken with his person, and made observers comprehend, by the extent of its degradation, the greatness and persistence of the man’s designs upon Mademoiselle Cormon."
"哎，连他的牙齿人们也编出了很多逸闻趣事；骑士诙谐的言谈也越来越少了。尽管如此，他的胃口却没变，骑士把他的肠胃从这希望全毁的浩劫里给救出来了。虽然他准备鼻烟时有气无力，可是饭量倒是挺惊人的。骑士现在很少和戈里扎公主谈话了，由此诸位可以了解到科尔蒙小姐的婚事在思想和精神上对他造成了多大的灾难。","Alas, too, the anecdotes went the way of the teeth; the clever sayings grew rare.The appetite, however, remained; the old nobleman saved nothing but his stomach from the wreck of his hopes; though he languidly prepared his pinches of snuff, he ate alarming dinners.Perhaps you will more fully understand the disaster that this marriage was to the mind and heart of the chevalier when you learn that his intercourse with the Princess Goritza became less frequent."
"一天，他到阿芒德小姐家，他裤子的小腿肚子部分扭到了小腿前头。骑士如此不修边幅，我向你保证，这惊恐了整个阿郎松城。这个原本还是小伙子的人突然变得老态龙钟了，内心的消沉让他从五十岁一下变成了九十岁，吓坏了所有的人。而且，他也道出了自己的秘密，说他曾经等待科尔蒙小姐，希望能娶到她。他就像是个耐心的猎手，花了十年的时间来瞄准自己的目标，却最终没有击中猎物！总之，并不强大的共和国在复辟时期打败了勇敢的骑士！形式取得了胜利，物质战胜了精神，暴动胜过了外交。","One day he appeared in Mademoiselle Armande’s salon with the calf of his leg on the shin-bone.This bankruptcy of the graces was, I do assure you, terrible, and struck all Alencon with horror.The late young man had become an old one; this human being, who, by the breaking-down of his spirit, had passed at once from fifty to ninety years of age, frightened society.Besides, his secret was betrayed; he had waited and watched for Mademoiselle Cormon; he had, like a patient hunter, adjusted his aim for ten whole years, and finally had missed the game!In short, the impotent Republic had won the day from Valiant Chivalry, and that, too, under the Restoration!Form triumphed; mind was vanquished by matter, diplomacy by insurrection."
"还有更致命的一击呢！一位自尊心受伤的女工，泄露了骑士每天上午怎样度过的秘密，现在大家都把他当作一个浪荡子。现在自由党人把以前说是迪布斯基耶的那些私生子栽赃到骑士的头上。阿郎松的圣日耳曼区倒是很得意地接受了这种传言，他们说：“这可怜的骑士，他还能干什么别的事呢？”他们很可怜骑士，把他纳入他们的圈子，重新唤起了他脸上偶尔的微笑，同时也激起了他对迪布斯基耶的痛恨。有十一个人离开了科尔蒙沙龙，转而加入德埃斯格里尼翁家去了。","And, O final blow! A mortified grisette revealed the secret of the chevalier’s mornings, and he now passed for a libertine.The liberals cast at his door all the foundlings hitherto attributed to du Bousquier.But the faubourg Saint-Germain of Alencon accepted them proudly: it even said, “That poor chevalier, what else could he do?”The faubourg pitied him, gathered him closer to their circle, and brought back a few rare smiles to his face; but frightful enmity was piled upon the head of du Bousquier.Eleven persons deserted the Cormon salon, and passed to that of the d’Esgrignons."
"老姑娘的婚事产生的一个重要的影响是，阿郎松明显分出了两党派。德埃斯格里尼翁家代表着高等贵族（特雷维尔一家人回来以后也归附那边了）；科尔蒙家在迪布斯基耶巧妙的影响下，代表着既不完全的自由派，又非忠贞的保王派，产生了二百二十一名反对党议员那种糟糕的见解。当时，最有尊严的、最伟大的、唯一真正的政权——王权，与最虚假的、最不可捉摸的、最压榨人的政权——经过选举产生的议会所行使的所谓议会权利，这二者在那著名的一天公开斗争，于是在这种情形下，产生了二百二十一人。迪龙瑟雷沙龙暗中和科尔蒙沙龙联盟，属于大胆的自由派。","The old maid’s marriage had a signal effect in defining the two parties in Alencon.The salon d’Esgrignon represented the upper aristocracy (the returning Troisvilles attached themselves to it); the Cormon salon represented, under the clever influence of du Bousquier, that fatal class of opinions which, without being truly liberal or resolutely royalist, gave birth to the 221 on that famous day when the struggle openly began between the most august, grandest, and only true power, ROYALTY, and the most false, most changeful, most oppressive of all powers,—the power called PARLIAMENTARY, which elective assemblies exercise.The salon du Ronceret, secretly allied to the Cormon salon, was boldly liberal."
"德斯蓬德神父从普雷博戴回来后，一直闷闷不乐。他将这所有的不快都压在心底，不会在他外甥女面前提半句。但是他却对阿芒德小姐敞开心扉，坦白说，就算是荒唐，他总觉得德瓦卢瓦骑士比迪布斯基耶先生好得多。他这可怜的老头也活不了多少天了，换作是亲爱的骑士，就绝对不会情调低下地使他烦闷了，而迪布斯基耶把好好的老宅中的一切都破坏了。神父已经无神的眼中淌着几滴老泪，说道：","The Abbe de Sponde, after his return from Prebaudet, bore many and continual sufferings, which he kept within his breast, saying no word of them to his niece.But to Mademoiselle Armande he opened his heart, admitting that, folly for folly, he would much have preferred the Chevalier de Valois to Monsieur du Bousquier.Never would the dear chevalier have had the bad taste to contradict and oppose a poor old man who had but a few days more to live; du Bousquier had destroyed everything in the good old home.The abbe said, with scanty tears moistening his aged eyes,—"
"“小姐，现在连我自由行走了五十年的小树林都没有了。我最心爱的菩提树全被砍掉了！等我闭眼的时候，共和国也会以这种搅得天翻地覆的形式出现在我面前的。”","“Mademoiselle, I haven’t even the little grove where I have walked for fifty years.My beloved lindens are all cut down!At the moment of my death the Republic appears to me more than ever under the form of a horrible destruction of the Home.”"
"“您要原谅您的外甥女，”德瓦卢瓦骑士说，“共和思想是追求自由的年轻人误入歧途的第一步，他们后来发现自由是最残暴的专横，是那些没有本事的无赖的专长。您可怜的外甥女会从她开始犯罪的地方受到惩罚的。”","“You must pardon your niece,” said the Chevalier de Valois.“Republican ideas are the first error of youth which seeks for liberty; later it finds it the worst of despotisms,—that of an impotent canaille.Your poor niece is punished where she sinned.”"
"“墙上画的都是赤裸的女人，这样的房子我怎么能呆呀？”可怜的神父说，“哪里还有菩提树可以让我在树阴下念日课经呀？”","“What will become of me in a house where naked women are painted on the walls?” said the poor abbe.“Where shall I find other lindens beneath which to read my breviary?”"
"就像惯于凝望一株冷杉思考的康德一样，当那棵冷杉被砍倒以后，康德再也找不到他的思路了。善良的神父穿过没有树阴的小路时，再也没有原来那股祷告的热忱了。迪布斯基耶在那里修起了英国式的花园。","Like Kant, who was unable to collect his thoughts after the fir-tree at which he was accustomed to gaze while meditating was cut down, so the poor abbe could never attain the ardor of his former prayers while walking up and down the shadeless paths.Du Bousquier had planted an English garden."
"“这样更好了。”迪布斯基耶夫人不经思考地说。库蒂里耶神父准许她做了很多错事以取悦她的丈夫。","“It was best,” said Madame du Bousquier, without thinking so; but the Abbe Couterier had authorized her to commit many wrongs to please her husband."
"这番修葺完全破坏了这所老房子原本古朴恬静的风貌，使其失去了原来的风采。像不修边幅、可以说是放弃了自己权利的德瓦卢瓦骑士一样，科尔蒙沙龙原来的市民阶级的庄重气派也荡然无存了。现在客厅已经变成了雪白、金黄的颜色，摆上了桃花心木的土耳其长沙发，装上了蓝色丝绸的帷幔。饭厅被装饰成了现代化的风格，色调不如以前温暖了，饭菜也不像以前一样吃得那么舒服了。迪库徳赖先生甚至说他感觉墙上画的人像是惊恐地瞪着他，以至于他的俏皮话都被卡在喉咙里，说出不来了。房屋的外部仍然是外省的风格，但是房屋内已经完全是执政府时期商人的风格，散发的全都是经纪人的低俗趣味——例如，粉饰灰泥廊柱、镜子门、希腊式模具、毫无意义的装饰轮廓，各类风格掺杂，透着不合时宜、不合时令的华丽。","These restorations destroyed all the venerable dignity, cordiality, and patriarchal air of the old house.Like the Chevalier de Valois, whose personal neglect might be called an abdication, the bourgeois dignity of the Cormon salon no longer existed when it was turned to white and gold, with mahogany ottomans covered in blue satin.The dining-room, adorned in modern taste, was colder in tone than it used to be, and the dinners were eaten with less appetite than formerly.Monsieur du Coudrai declared that he felt his puns stick in his throat as he glanced at the figures painted on the walls, which looked him out of countenance.Externally, the house was still provincial; but internally everything revealed the purveyor of the Directory and the bad taste of the money-changer,—for instance, columns in stucco, glass doors, Greek mouldings, meaningless outlines, all styles conglomerated, magnificence out of place and out of season."
"足有半月之久，阿郎松城的人对于这过分的奢侈纷纷加以恶评。可是几个月以后，他们又以此为傲了，有几家富商也重新装修了他们的房子，布置了漂亮的客厅。时髦的家具开始在城里出现，而且还能看到无影灯了！","The town of Alencon gabbled for two weeks over this luxury, which seemed unparalleled; but a few months later the community was proud of it, and several rich manufacturers restored their houses and set up fine salons.Modern furniture came into the town, and astral lamps were seen!"
"德斯蓬德神父是第一个看透这桩婚事已经给他心爱的外甥女带来不幸的人。婚后的第一个冬天，迪布斯基耶每月举办两次舞会，彻底地抹去了主宰神父和外甥女过去生活的那种高贵而单纯的特点。唉，在这神圣的老房子里，竟然听得到小提琴和交际场那种世俗的音乐！在他们寻欢作乐的时候，神父始终跪在地上祈祷。后来，这个严肃沙龙的政治体系也逐渐变味了。神父看透了迪布斯基耶的心思；他一听见迪布斯基耶专横的语调就浑身战栗。他看见外甥女眼中的泪光，因为她现在已经失去了对自己财产的控制权，她的丈夫只让她管理衣物、饭菜和其他女人应管的事情。罗丝现在已经没有发号施令的机会了。雅克兰已经成为专职车夫，勒内是专职马夫，玛丽埃特现在只是个厨房的女佣，再加上从巴黎请来的主厨，这几个人现在都只听从先生一人的命令。迪布斯基耶夫人现在只有若赛特一人可以自由使唤了。要放弃行使权利的愉悦，那会让人有多难过呀？意志的胜利对于伟大的人来说是一种令人陶醉的快乐，而对于心胸狭隘的人来说，这便是生活的全部。一定要当过失了宠的大臣，才能理解迪布斯基耶夫人被贬为完完全全的奴仆身份时所感受到的辛酸滋味。她经常违心地坐上马车，被自己不喜欢的仆人围绕，她再也不能掌管她宝贵的金钱了，虽然以前她也不怎么花钱，但是那时她知道如果她想就可以随便花。","The Abbe de Sponde was among the first to perceive the secret unhappiness this marriage now brought to the private life of his beloved niece.The character of noble simplicity which had hitherto ruled their lives was lost during the first winter, when du Bousquier gave two balls every month.Oh, to hear violins and profane music at these worldly entertainments in the sacred old house!The abbe prayed on his knees while the revels lasted.Next the political system of the sober salon was slowly perverted.The abbe fathomed du Bousquier; he shuddered at his imperious tone; he saw the tears in his niece’s eyes when she felt herself losing all control over her own property; for her husband now left nothing in her hands but the management of the linen, the table, and things of a kind which are the lot of women.Rose had no longer any orders to give.Monsieur’s will was alone regarded by Jacquelin, now become coachman, by Rene, the groom, and by the chef, who came from Paris, Mariette being reduced to kitchen maid.Madame du Bousquier had no one to rule but Josette.Who knows what it costs to relinquish the delights of power?If the triumph of the will is one of the intoxicating pleasures in the lives of great men, it is the ALL of life to narrow minds.One must needs have been a minister dismissed from power to comprehend the bitter pain which came upon Madame du Bousquier when she found herself reduced to this absolute servitude.She often got into the carriage against her will; she saw herself surrounded by servants who were distasteful to her; she no longer had the handling of her dear money,—she who had known herself free to spend money, and did not spend it."
"所有这些强加的限制，都让人产生想要越过这些限制的强烈欲望。最强烈的痛苦便是对自由意志的阻挠。然而，所有这一切开始时都还算顺利。对丈夫做出的每一个让步，都是出于老姑娘对丈夫的爱。最初，迪布斯基耶对待妻子的做法是很讨她欢心的。他做得很聪明也很漂亮，每次他践踏女权，都给出了很充分的理由。因此，迪布斯基耶夫人婚后头两年都显得很满意。她故意显出谦恭的样子，这是为爱而结婚的少妇的特点。她也不再受血热的折磨了。这种满足的表现与关于迪布斯基耶的流言蜚语相矛盾，让那些专爱讥讽的人很狼狈，而善于观察人心灵的人也感到困惑不解。罗丝-玛丽-维克图瓦很害怕做出让丈夫不高兴的事或是冲撞他而失去他的欢心，失去他的朝夕相伴，所以她愿意为他牺牲所有，甚至包括她的舅父。她那愚昧的小小欢乐甚至也骗过了可怜的德斯蓬德神父，老人想着毕竟外甥女感到幸福，那他也就应该忍受自己的痛苦。","All imposed limits make the human being desire to go beyond them.The keenest sufferings come from the thwarting of self-will.The beginning of this state of things was, however, rose-colored.Every concession made to marital authority was an effect of the love which the poor woman felt for her husband.Du Bousquier behaved, in the first instance, admirably to his wife: he was wise; he was excellent; he gave her the best of reasons for each new encroachment.So for the first two years of her marriage Madame du Bousquier appeared to be satisfied.She had that deliberate, demure little air which distinguishes young women who have married for love.The rush of blood to her head no longer tormented her.This appearance of satisfaction routed the scoffers, contradicted certain rumors about du Bousquier, and puzzled all observers of the human heart.Rose-Marie-Victoire was so afraid that if she displeased her husband or opposed him, she would lose his affection and be deprived of his company, that she would willingly have sacrificed all to him, even her uncle.Her silly little forms of pleasure deceived even the poor abbe for a time, who endured his own trials all the better for thinking that his niece was happy, after all."
"阿郎松人最初也都是这么想的。但是有一个人，你就是骗得了全城的人，也骗不过他。德瓦卢瓦骑士躲在高等贵族的圣山上，终日在埃斯格里尼翁家里打发时间。他听着人们各式各样的饶舌和流言蜚语，日夜想着他应该怎样复仇。他想打击迪布斯基耶，正中其心脏。","Alencon at first thought the same.But there was one man more difficult to deceive than the whole town put together.The Chevalier de Valois, who had taken refuge on the Sacred Mount of the upper aristocracy, now passed his life at the d’Esgrignons.He listened to the gossip and the gabble, and he thought day and night upon his vengeance.He meant to strike du Bousquier to the heart."
"可怜的神父也完全明白了外甥女在这第一次也是最后一次恋爱中的怯弱，他正一点一点地看透这个外甥女婿的虚伪本性和毒辣手段，气得浑身战栗。尽管迪布斯基耶因为想到要继承舅老爷的财产，还是比较克制自己，不想激怒他，但还是给了这老神父致命的一击，将他送进了坟墓。如果你用“有坚强的原则”来解释“偏狭”一词，如果你不想谴责德斯蓬德神父的禁欲主义（瓦尔特·司各特曾通过珍妮·迪恩斯的父亲这个清教徒，使人们对禁欲主义非常敬佩），如果你想在罗马教会中理解“宁死不受辱”的精神——你很欣赏共和派见解中的这一点，当斯蓬德神父看见那个离经叛道、归属异端、信奉异教的神父、教会的敌人、宣誓忠于《教士的公民组织法》的那个家伙出现在他外甥女婿的客厅里时，你就能够理解他的心情了。迪布斯基耶怀着要在这地方称王称霸的野心，想要促成圣莱奥纳尔教堂的主持和郊区的神父和解，并以此作为他能力的初步证明，他的目的达成了。他的妻子以为他是完成了一桩促进和平的大业，而坚定不移的神父只认为这是离经叛道。主教来到迪布斯基耶家中，似乎很满意双方敌对行为的终止。高乃依的剧本中有一句台词是：“主呀，你使我憎恨多少高尚的品德呀！”除了可以和高乃依一起高喊这句话的老罗马天主教徒之外，弗朗索瓦教士的高尚品德已经战胜了偏见。正教在教区里消亡的时候，德斯蓬德神父便去世了。","The poor abbe fully understood the baseness of this first and last love of his niece; he shuddered as, little by little, he perceived the hypocritical nature of his nephew and his treacherous manoeuvres.Though du Bousquier restrained himself, as he thought of the abbe’s property, and wished not to cause him vexation, it was his hand that dealt the blow that sent the old priest to his grave.If you will interpret the word INTOLERANCE as FIRMNESS OF PRINCIPLE, if you do not wish to condemn in the catholic soul of the Abbe de Sponde the stoicism which Walter Scott has made you admire in the puritan soul of Jeanie Deans’ father; if you are willing to recognize in the Roman Church the Potius mori quam foedari that you admire in republican tenets,—you will understand the sorrow of the Abbe de Sponde when he saw in his niece’s salon the apostate priest, the renegade, the pervert, the heretic, that enemy of the Church, the guilty taker of the Constitutional oath.Du Bousquier, whose secret ambition was to lay down the law to the town, wished, as a first proof of his power, to reconcile the minister of Saint-Leonard with the rector of the parish, and he succeeded.His wife thought he had accomplished a work of peace where the immovable abbe saw only treachery.The bishop came to visit du Bousquier, and seemed glad of the cessation of hostilities.The virtues of the Abbe Francois had conquered prejudice, except that of the aged Roman Catholic, who exclaimed with Cornelle, “Alas! what virtues do you make me hate!”The abbe died when orthodoxy thus expired in the diocese."
"到了一八一九年，德斯蓬德神父的遗产让迪布斯基耶夫人的土地收入增加到了二万五千法郎，这还没有包括普雷博戴的土地和瓦诺布勒的房产。这时，迪布斯基耶把从前她妻子交出的积蓄还给了她，让她用这笔钱去购买普雷博戴四周的地产。如此，就把这片领地扩大成全省最大的领地了，因为德斯蓬德神父的土地也与之相毗连。于是迪布斯基耶成了全省最大的财主之一。这个精明人一直是自由党的候选人，却在复辟时期的每次竞选中都以七八票之差落选。后来他干脆公然抛弃自由党，想被选为保王党大臣。虽然圣会和司法界都支持他，但他却从来未能克服国家行政管理部门对他的厌恶。这个满怀仇恨和疯狂野心的共和党人，决心在保王党与贵族在当地获胜的时候，和他们争个高低。他通过假装虔诚的一系列行为赢得了教会的支持：他陪妻子去弥撒，他给该城的修道院捐款，他支持圣心派教会，在每个教会和城镇、省或国家对立的场合中他都表态支持教会。于是他暗中受到自由党的支持，又受到教会的保护，他一直保持君主立宪派的立场，不断地与省内的贵族竞争，以期搞垮贵族，并最终将贵族搞垮。他时刻留心贵族老爷们和政府犯下的错误，逐步有计划地实施他对那些拥有城堡的人，特别是埃斯格里尼翁家族的报复，有朝一日他要将蘸着毒汁的匕首刺进这些人的胸膛。","In 1819, the property of the Abbe de Sponde increased Madame du Bousquier’s income from real estate to twenty-five thousand francs without counting Prebaudet or the house in the Val-Noble.About this time du Bousquier returned to his wife the capital of her savings which she had yielded to him; and he made her use it in purchasing lands contiguous to Prebaudet, which made that domain one of the most considerable in the department, for the estates of the Abbe de Sponde also adjoined it.Du Bousquier thus passed for one of the richest men of the department.This able man, the constant candidate of the liberals, missing by seven or eight votes only in all the electoral battles fought under the Restoration, and who ostensibly repudiated the liberals by trying to be elected as a ministerial royalist (without ever being able to conquer the aversion of the administration),—this rancorous republican, mad with ambition, resolved to rival the royalism and aristocracy of Alencon at the moment when they once more had the upper hand.He strengthened himself with the Church by the deceitful appearance of a well-feigned piety: he accompanied his wife to mass; he gave money for the convents of the town; he assisted the congregation of the Sacre-Coeur; he took sides with the clergy on all occasions when the clergy came into collision with the town, the department, or the State.Secretly supported by the liberals, protected by the Church, calling himself a constitutional royalist, he kept beside the aristocracy of the department in the one hope of ruining it,—and he did ruin it.Ever on the watch for the faults and blunders of the nobility and the government, he laid plans for his vengeance against the “chateau-people,” and especially against the d’Esgrignons, in whose bosom he was one day to thrust a poisoned dagger."
"他对阿郎松的贡献包括慷慨地捐助阿郎松制造业的复兴，振兴了布匹贸易，并在城里建立了一个工厂。通过将自己的利益和大众利益联系起来，做这些保皇党派不会做的事，迪布斯基耶没有冒一个子儿的风险就赢得了大众人心。有他的财产作为靠山，他可以等到别人弄出成果而又因为手头拮据需要放弃的时候，再做个幸运的接手人。","Among other benefits to the town he gave money liberally to revive the manufacture of point d’Alencon; he renewed the trade in linens, and the town had a factory.Inscribing himself thus upon the interests and heart of the masses, by doing what the royalists did not do, du Bousquier did not really risk a farthing.Backed by his fortune, he could afford to wait results which enterprising persons who involve themselves are forced to abandon to luckier successors."
"迪布斯基耶现在摆出银行家的架势。这个小号的拉斐特很有把握将各新兴产业先预定下来。他自己发财的同时，也明显给大众带来了利益。他是成立保险公司的主使者，是新公共运输企业的保护人；他建议写请愿书，要求国家管理部门修建必要的道路和桥梁。政府因此受到了警告，并认为这是对其权威的侵犯。这样的争执实在很笨拙，因为当地的利益迫使政府权威最终还是必须让步。迪布斯基耶加深了外省贵族与宫廷贵族、贵族院之间的矛盾。最后，他为君主立宪派的一大部分人参加《辩论报》和夏多步里昂先生发起的反对王权的斗争做好了思想上的准备。这《辩论报》和夏多布里昂先生，是忘恩负义、以卑劣的个人利益为出发点的反对派，也是促成一八三零年资产阶级和新闻界获得胜利的原因之一。","Du Bousquier now posed as a banker.This miniature Lafitte was a partner in all new enterprises, taking good security.He served himself while apparently serving the interests of the community.He was the prime mover of insurance companies, the protector of new enterprises for public conveyance; he suggested petitions for asking the administration for the necessary roads and bridges.Thus warned, the government considered this action an encroachment of its own authority.A struggle was begun injudiciously, for the good of the community compelled the authorities to yield in the end.Du Bousquier embittered the provincial nobility against the court nobility and the peerage; and finally he brought about the shocking adhesion of a strong party of constitutional royalists to the warfare sustained by the “Journal des Debats,” and M. de Chateaubriand against the throne,—an ungrateful opposition based on ignoble interests, which was one cause of the triumph of the bourgeoisie and journalism in 1830."
"因而，迪布斯基耶和他所代表的阶级一样，很满足地看着君主政体的丧礼。这个在人群中压抑的老共和党，演了十五年的戏剧以便成功解决他的积怨。现在他在民众的掌声中，亲手将市政府的白旗打翻在地。对于一八三零年八月在法国竖起的新宝座，没有人会投以他那样的目光，那种陶醉于痛快的复仇之中的目光了。幼支的登台就是法国革命的胜利。对他来说，三色旗的胜利就是山岳派的复活。因为这次的行动没有从前那样粗暴，所以山岳派将以比断头台更加可靠的手段将贵族打倒。贵族院已取消了世袭权，国民自卫军将街角上的食品杂货商和侯爵安置在同一张行军床上，由一位资产阶级律师提出并取消了贵族的长子世袭财产制度，天主教会被剥夺了至高无上的权利；在迪布斯基耶看来，一八三零年八月各种立法上的新条例，就是一七九三年那些条例最明智的应用。","Thus du Bousquier, in common with the class he represented, had the satisfaction of beholding the funeral of royalty.The old republican, smothered with masses, who for fifteen years had played that comedy to satisfy his vendetta, himself threw down with his own hand the white flag of the mayoralty to the applause of the multitude.No man in France cast upon the new throne raised in August, 1830, a glance of more intoxicated, joyous vengeance.The accession of the Younger Branch was the triumph of the Revolution.To him the victory of the tricolor meant the resurrection of Montagne, which this time should surely bring the nobility down to the dust by means more certain than that of the guillotine, because less violent.The peerage without heredity; the National Guard, which puts on the same camp-bed the corner grocer and the marquis; the abolition of the entails demanded by a bourgeois lawyer; the Catholic Church deprived of its supremacy; and all the other legislative inventions of August, 1830,—were to du Bousquier the wisest possible application of the principles of 1793."
"这个人自从一八三零年就当上了税务局局长。为了他的高升，他一直依附于和路易-菲力浦国王的父亲——奥尔良公爵的关系，以及和国王的母亲——奥尔良公爵夫人的前总管福尔蒙先生的关系。他的年收入有八万法郎左右。在人们的眼中，迪布斯基耶已经是一位有钱人，一位可敬之人，他坚守他的原则，为人正直，乐于助人。多亏了他，阿郎松才得以加入工业运动的行列，并且因此整个布列塔尼才与人们所谓的现代文明相连接起来。到一八一六年，阿郎松城已经看不见两辆干净的马车了。在这十年间，当看见敞篷四轮马车、双座四轮轿式马车、双棚四轮马车、有蓬的双轮轻便马车和两人乘坐的轻便双轮马车在街上奔驰的时候，阿郎松人也不再感到惊讶了。资产阶级和地主最初对物价上涨吓得要命，后来也意识到生活方式的提高对于他们的收入有反冲击作用。当地人都接受了迪龙瑟雷院长富有预见性的那句话：“迪布斯基耶是个非常能干的人！”","Since 1830 this man has been a receiver-general.He relied for his advancement on his relations with the Duc d’Orleans, father of Louis Philippe, and with Monsieur de Folmon, formerly steward to the Duchess-dowager of Orleans.He receives about eighty thousand francs a year.In the eyes of the people about him Monsieur du Bousquier is a man of means,—a respectable man, steady in his principles, upright, and obliging.Alencon owes to him its connection with the industrial movement by which Brittany may possibly some day be joined to what is popularly called modern civilization.Alencon, which up to 1816 could boast of only two private carriages, saw, without amazement, in the course of ten years, coupes, landaus, tilburies, and cabriolets rolling through her streets.The burghers and the land-owners, alarmed at first lest the price of everything should increase, recognized later that this increase in the style of living had a contrary effect upon their revenues.The prophetic remark of du Ronceret, “Du Bousquier is a very strong man,” was adopted by the whole country-side."
"但是，这句话对于他妻子来说，却很不幸地具有双重意义。作为丈夫，他可完全不像那个公共政治家。这位伟大的公民，在外面那么主张自由，对当地的事业那么有热情，那么和蔼可亲，可是在家里却是专制暴君，完全缺少夫妻恩爱。这个如此奸诈、虚伪、狡猾的人，这个瓦诺布勒的克伦威尔，在家里的做法和他对贵族的做法一样，给予爱抚以期能够将其扼杀。像他的朋友贝纳多特一样，他给自己的铁手掌戴上了丝绒手套。他的妻子没有给他生下一儿半女。苏珊的话和骑士的暗示如此得到了证实。但是自由派资产阶级、君主立宪派资产阶级、乡绅、司法界和《宪政报》所说的教士派，都说是迪布斯基耶夫人的错。“她太老了，”他们说，“迪布斯基耶娶她的时候，她就很老了。况且，对于这可怜的女人来说也是幸运的，她这个年纪生孩子多危险呀！”当她在迪库徳赖夫人、迪龙瑟雷夫人面前，哭着坦白自己阶段性的失望时，这些太太们总是说：","But, unhappily for the wife, that saying has a double meaning.The husband does not in any way resemble the public politician.This great citizen, so liberal to the world about him, so kindly inspired with love for his native place, is a despot in his own house, and utterly devoid of conjugal affection.This man, so profoundly astute, hypocritical, and sly; this Cromwell of the Val-Noble,—behaves in his home as he behaves to the aristocracy, whom he caresses in hopes to throttle them.Like his friend Bernadotte, he wears a velvet glove upon his iron hand.His wife has given him no children.Suzanne’s remark and the chevalier’s insinuations were therefore justified.But the liberal bourgeoisie, the constitutional-royalist-bourgeoisie, the country-squires, the magistracy, and the “church party” laid the blame on Madame du Bousquier.“She was too old,” they said; “Monsieur du Bousquier had married her too late.Besides, it was very lucky for the poor woman; it was dangerous at her age to bear children!”When Madame du Bousquier confided, weeping, her periodic despair to Mesdames du Coudrai and du Ronceret, those ladies would reply,—"
"“亲爱的，你疯了吧！你不知道你想要的是什么！生一个孩子可能会要了你的命呢！”","“But you are crazy, my dear; you don’t know what you are wishing for; a child would be your death.”"
"许多将自己的希望寄托在迪布斯基耶的胜利之上的那些男人，都在妻子们面前给他唱赞歌，因而这些妻子们也对这可怜的老姑娘说这样的话：","Many men, whose hopes were fastened on du Bousquier’s triumph, sang his praises to their wives, who in turn repeated them to the poor wife in some such speech as this:—"
"“亲爱的，你真有福气呀，嫁了一个这么能干的人；你不会像别的女人那样受罪，嫁给了没有魄力的男人，既不能理财也不懂教养孩子。”","“You are very lucky, dear, to have married such an able man; you’ll escape the misery of women whose husbands are men without energy, incapable of managing their property, or bringing up their children.”"
"“你的丈夫让你成了当地的皇后呀，亲爱的。他永远不会让你陷入窘境，绝对不会。哎呀，他可领导着整个阿郎松城呢！”","“Your husband is making you queen of the department, my love.He’ll never leave you embarrassed, not he!Why, he leads all Alencon.”"
"“但是我希望，”可怜的妻子说道，“他能少为公众的事操心，并且——”","“But I wish,” said the poor wife, “that he gave less time to the public and—”"
"“你真是太挑剔了，亲爱的迪布斯基耶夫人。我敢说，全城的女人都羡慕你有这样的好丈夫。”","“You are hard to please, my dear Madame du Bousquier.I assure you that all the women in town envy you your husband.”"
"人们不理解她并开始责怪她，于是这虔诚的基督徒在她家里给自己的美德找到了广阔的天地来表现。她生活在泪水中，但是她始终在人前露出温和的面容。对此这个基督徒一直受着一个念头的折磨：“我本来爱的是德瓦卢瓦骑士，却嫁给了迪布斯基耶。”这个念头在她的内心无异于一桩罪过。可怜的阿塔纳斯对她的爱情也像是悔恨的幽灵，一直追随她到梦中。舅父在去世之时终于迸发了他的悲伤，他的亡故使她的生活更加悲痛，因为她现在也感受到舅父看着家中的政治和宗教气氛变化时所承受的痛苦。不幸的事往往有如晴天霹雳突然袭来，就像格朗松太太遭受的不幸那样；但是不幸发生在老姑娘身上，却像一滴油慢慢渗入衣料那样缓慢而持久。","Misjudged by society, which began by blaming her, the pious woman found ample opportunity in her home to display her virtues.She lived in tears, but she never ceased to present to others a placid face.To so Christian a soul a certain thought which pecked forever at her heart was a crime: “I loved the Chevalier de Valois,” it said; “but I have married du Bousquier.”The love of poor Athanase Granson also rose like a phantom of remorse, and pursued her even in her dreams.The death of her uncle, whose griefs at the last burst forth, made her life still more sorrowful; for she now felt the suffering her uncle must have endured in witnessing the change of political and religious opinion in the old house.Sorrow often falls like a thunderbolt, as it did on Madame Granson; but in this old maid it slowly spread like a drop of oil, which never leaves the stuff that slowly imbibes it."
"正是德瓦卢瓦骑士这狡猾的操纵者铸成了迪布斯基耶夫人的莫大不幸。骑士一心要让老姑娘破除对宗教的幻想，他这位恋爱专家，对于不管是结了婚的还是之前单身的迪布斯基耶的心思，都看透了。但这非常警惕的共和党人很不好对付。他们刚结婚时，有些人与科尔蒙家不再往来。对于这些人，迪布斯基耶的沙龙自然关上了门，同样也不再对德瓦卢瓦骑士开放。而且这个人完全不怕成为笑柄。他有巨额财富，他领导着阿郎松，他对自己的老婆毫不关切，就像理查三世对待助他夺得战役胜利后死去的战马一样。为了讨丈夫欢心，迪布斯基耶夫人早已和德埃斯格里尼翁家断绝了关系，再也不去拜访了。偶尔当她丈夫留她一人在家到巴黎小住的时候，她会去短暂地拜访阿芒德小姐。","The Chevalier de Valois was the malicious manipulator who brought about the crowning misfortune of Madame du Bousquier’s life.His heart was set on undeceiving her pious simplicity; for the chevalier, expert in love, divined du Bousquier, the married man, as he had divined du Bousquier, the bachelor.But the wary republican was difficult of attack.His salon was, of course, closed to the Chevalier de Valois, as to all those who, in the early days of his marriage, had slighted the Cormon mansion.He was, moreover, impervious to ridicule; he possessed a vast fortune; he reigned in Alencon; he cared as little for his wife as Richard III. cared for the dead horse which had helped him win a battle.To please her husband, Madame du Bousquier had broken off relations with the d’Esgrignon household, where she went no longer, except that sometimes when her husband left her during his trips to Paris, she would pay a brief visit to Mademoiselle Armande."
"在她婚后三年、德斯蓬德神父去世的时候，她们在圣莱奥纳尔教堂参加为神父做的追悼弥撒。走出教堂时，阿芒德小姐走到迪布斯基耶夫人身边。善良的阿芒德小姐认为，她应该在这种情况下去安慰下这位悲痛的外甥女。他们一边走着，一边谈着亲爱的故人，一直走到迪布斯基耶夫人禁止入内的公馆。他们正谈在兴头上，于是阿芒德小姐就把迪布斯基耶夫人拉进公馆。这可怜而孤独凄凉的女人是多么高兴能和她舅父所喜欢的人一起谈论她的舅父呀。并且，她也想问候下老侯爵，她已经将近三年没有见过老侯爵了。当时是中午一点半，她在埃斯格里尼翁公馆见到了来吃晚饭的德瓦卢瓦骑士。骑士握着她的双手向她鞠躬问好。","About three years after her marriage, at the time of the Abbe de Sponde’s death, Mademoiselle Armande joined Madame du Bousquier as they were leaving Saint-Leonard’s, where they had gone to hear a requiem said for him.The generous demoiselle thought that on this occasion she owed her sympathy to the niece in trouble.They walked together, talking of the dear deceased, until they reached the forbidden house, into which Mademoiselle Armande enticed Madame du Bousquier by the charm of her manner and conversation.The poor desolate woman was glad to talk of her uncle with one whom he truly loved.Moreover, she wanted to receive the condolences of the old marquis, whom she had not seen for nearly three years.It was half-past one o’clock, and she found at the hotel d’Esgrignon the Chevalier de Valois, who had come to dinner.As he bowed to her, he took her by the hands."
"“啊，亲爱的德高望重的夫人，”他语气激动地对她说道,“我们失去了我们圣洁的朋友，我们分担了您的哀痛。是的，人们在这里也和您家里一样，深切地感受到您的损失，甚至更感悲痛.”他补上一句，暗指迪布斯基耶。","“Well, dear, virtuous, and beloved lady,” he said, in a tone of emotion, “we have lost our sainted friend; we share your grief.Yes, your loss is as keenly felt here as in your own home,—more so,” he added, alluding to du Bousquier."
"在场的每个人都说了几句表示哀悼安慰的话。之后，骑士十分殷勤地拉过迪布斯基耶夫人的手臂，挎在自己的胳膊上，非常疼爱地按着她的手臂，将她带到一扇窗户前。","After a few more words of funeral oration, in which all present spoke from the heart, the chevalier took Madame du Bousquier’s arm, and, gallantly placing it within his own, pressed it adoringly as he led her to the recess of a window."
"“你过得幸福吗？”他以慈父般的语气说道。","“Are you happy?” he said in a fatherly voice."
"“是的。”她眼帘低垂着说道。","“Yes,” she said, dropping her eyes."
"赛布洛夫公主的女儿、德特雷维尔夫人和年迈的德卡泰朗侯爵夫人和阿尔芒德小姐一起走到骑士这边，她们正好听到了这句“是的”。他们在晚饭开始前都到花园去散步。迪布斯基耶夫人完全没有发现有一个小阴谋正在进行。","Hearing that “Yes,” Madame de Troisville, the daughter of the Princess Scherbellof, and the old Marquise de Casteran came up and joined the chevalier, together with Mademoiselle Armande.They all went to walk in the garden until dinner was served, without any perception on the part of Madame du Bousquier that a little conspiracy was afoot."
"“我们现在逮到她了，让我们来弄清真相吧。”所有在场之人的眼神中写着这样一句话。","“We have her! Now let us find out the secret of the case,” were the words written in the eyes of all present."
"“如果你要十全十美的幸福，”阿尔芒德小姐说道，“你必须要生个孩子，一个像我那可爱的侄子那样的男孩——”","“To make your happiness complete,” said Mademoiselle Armande, “you ought to have children,—a fine lad like my nephew—”"
"迪布斯基耶夫人的眼中开始泛着泪光。","Tears seemed to start in Madame du Bousquier’s eyes."
"“我听说这都是您一个人的过错，听说您害怕会怀孕？”骑士说道。","“I have heard it said that you were the one to blame in the matter, and that you feared the dangers of a pregnancy,” said the chevalier."
"“我？”她毫无遮掩地说道，“如果可以的话，哪怕是要用下一百年炼狱作为代价来换一个孩子，我也愿意！”","“I!” she said artlessly.“I would buy a child with a hundred years of purgatory if I could.”"
"这个问题引发了一场争论，在德特雷维尔子爵夫人和年迈的德卡泰朗侯爵夫人引导下，争论进行得非常巧妙，以至于老姑娘不知不觉便将她家的秘密泄露了出来。阿芒德小姐挎着骑士的胳膊走开了，好让这三位妇女自由谈论婚姻生活。迪布斯基耶夫人那时已经从自己婚姻的种种骗局中醒悟过来了，但她还是那样愚昧，说了很多天真幼稚的话，让那几位听众觉得特别有滋有味。","On the question thus started a discussion arose, conducted by Madame de Troisville and the old Marquise de Casteran with such delicacy and adroitness that the poor victim revealed, without being aware of it, the secrets of her house.Mademoiselle Armande had taken the chevalier’s arm, and walked away so as to leave the three women free to discuss wedlock.Madame du Bousquier was then enlightened on the various deceptions of her marriage; and as she was still the same simpleton she had always been, she amused her advisers by delightful naivetes."
"尽管最初科尔蒙小姐捏造的婚事让全城的人都觉得可笑，但是之后大家又听到迪布斯基耶采取的伎俩，就对迪布斯基耶夫人给予了所有女人应有的尊敬和同情。科尔蒙小姐迫切想嫁人却嫁不出去的那段时间，人们都嘲笑她，但是当他们了解到她严格的宗教原则使她处于如此不同寻常的境地时，大家又都很敬佩她。“那个可怜的迪布斯基耶夫人”的称呼取代了“那位好心的科尔蒙小姐”的称呼。","Although at first the deceptive marriage of Mademoiselle Cormon made a laugh throughout the town, which was soon initiated into the story of the case, before long Madame du Bousquier won the esteem and sympathy of all the women.The fact that Mademoiselle Cormon had flung herself headlong into marriage without succeeding in being married, made everybody laugh at her; but when they learned the exceptional position in which the sternness of her religious principles placed her, all the world admired her.“That poor Madame du Bousquier” took the place of “That good Mademoiselle Cormon.”"
"因此，有一段时间，骑士把迪布斯基耶搞得那样滑稽可笑，令人讨厌。但是，当所有坏话都说尽了的时候，那些流言蜚语也就慢慢消失了，所有滑稽的事也逐渐不那么可笑了。后来，在许多人看来，那位不声不响的共和党人到了五十七岁的时候似乎要隐退了。这种情况让迪布斯基耶加深了对德埃斯格里尼翁家的仇恨，以至于在报仇之日来临时，迪布斯基耶是那么冷酷无情（参看《古董艺术馆》）。迪布斯基耶夫人得到命令，永远都不许再踏进那家的门槛。为了报复德瓦卢瓦骑士过去整他的种种，迪布斯基耶刚刚创立《奥恩通讯》时，便在该刊物上加了这么一个小通告：","Thus the chevalier contrived to render du Bousquier both ridiculous and odious for a time; but ridicule ends by weakening; when all had said their say about him, the gossip died out.Besides, at fifty-seven years of age the dumb republican seemed to many people to have a right to retire.This affair, however, envenomed the hatred which du Bousquier already bore to the house of Esgrignon to such a degree that it made him pitiless when the day of vengeance came.(See “The Gallery of Antiquities.”）Madame du Bousquier received orders never again to set foot into that house.By way of reprisals upon the chevalier for the trick thus played him, du Bousquier, who had just created the journal called the “Courrier de l’Orne,” caused the following notice to be inserted in it:—"
"“兹有德蓬布勒通先生，如能揭示其流亡国外之前、流亡期间或是流亡之后的生活，将获得一年一千法郎的固定收入。”","“Bonds to the amount of one thousand francs a year will be paid to any person who can prove the existence of one Monsieur de Pombreton before, during, or after the Emigration.”"
"尽管迪布斯基耶夫人的婚姻基本上是失败的，但是她也从中看到了一些好处：能对城市里最出类拔萃的男人表示关切，总好过自己一个人孤孤单单地过日子吧？迪布斯基耶总比那些老姑娘所喜欢的猫啊、狗啊、金丝雀什么的强吧。比起女佣、听忏悔的神师和窥视其遗产的人，迪布斯基耶对妻子的感情要更加真实一些，也没有那么的自私。此后，老姑娘把丈夫当成是神发怒的工具，因为她意识到了自己因对婚姻的欲望而犯下了无数的罪过。她认为这是在惩罚她，因为是她导致了格朗松太太的不幸和自己舅父的早逝。宗教里的信条是要人去亲吻用来惩罚你的笞杖，她信奉这个信条。因而她在公开场合赞美她的丈夫，支持他的观点。但是在忏悔室或是晚上，她常常痛哭流涕地祷告，祈求上帝饶恕她丈夫的背教行为。她丈夫总是口是心非，希望看到贵族和教会的灭亡，而这两件事正是科尔蒙家的信仰。","Although her marriage was essentially negative, Madame du Bousquier saw some advantages in it: was it not better to interest herself in the most remarkable man in the town than to live alone?Du Bousquier was preferable to a dog, or cat, or those canaries that spinsters love.He showed for his wife a sentiment more real and less selfish than that which is felt by servants, confessors, and hopeful heirs.Later in life she came to consider her husband as the instrument of divine wrath; for she then saw innumerable sins in her former desires for marriage; she regarded herself as justly punished for the sorrow she had brought on Madame Granson, and for the hastened death of her uncle.Obedient to that religion which commands us to kiss the rod with which the punishment is inflicted, she praised her husband, and publicly approved him.But in the confessional, or at night, when praying, she wept often, imploring God’s forgiveness for the apostasy of the man who thought the contrary of what he professed, and who desired the destruction of the aristocracy and the Church,—the two religions of the house of Cormon."
"在她的内心，她的全部感情都受到了践踏和殉葬，但是她的义务又迫使她去造就她丈夫的幸福，要用一种难以形容的爱去依恋他，久而久之就成了一种习惯，于是她的生活就成了永无休止、不合逻辑的矛盾混合物。她嫁了一个行为和见解都令她憎恨的人，但是她又要按照宗教义务规定的柔情去照顾他。当迪布斯基耶吃她做的果酱的时候或是觉得晚餐可口的时候，她总是欣喜若狂。她时刻留意要满足他每一个最细小的愿望。如果他将邮寄报纸的封套撕开后留在桌上了，女主人往往不会将它扔掉，她会说：","With all her feelings bruised and immolated within her, compelled by duty to make her husband happy, attached to him by a certain indefinable affection, born, perhaps, of habit, her life became one perpetual contradiction.She had married a man whose conduct and opinions she hated, but whom she was bound to care for with dutiful tenderness.Often she walked with the angels when du Bousquier ate her preserves or thought the dinner good.She watched to see that his slightest wish was satisfied.If he tore off the cover of his newspaper and left it on a table, instead of throwing it away, she would say:—"
"“勒内，留在那儿吧。先生不会是无意放在那里的。”","“Rene, leave that where it is; monsieur did not place it there without intention.”"
"如果迪布斯基耶要出门旅行了，她会为他的衣箱衣物而忙里忙外；她为他的物质生活提供最细心周到的照料。如果他要去普雷博戴，她会头一天晚上就看气压表，好了解第二天的天气怎么样。她从他的眼神里窥伺他的意愿，就像一条狗在睡觉的同时，也能听见和看见主人有什么要求。当肥胖的迪布斯基耶为这种恪守宗教信条的爱情所感动时，他便搂住她的腰，亲吻着她的额头，对她说：“你真是一个好妻子！” 这时候，这个可怜的女人便感动地眼里涌上快乐的泪水。迪布斯基耶很可能也自认为有义务要补偿罗丝－玛丽－维克图瓦的一些损失，因而赢得了她的尊重。天主教的美德并不要求迪布斯基耶夫人如此彻底地掩饰自己。这位圣洁的女子经常沉默地坐在一旁，听着那些披着君主立宪保皇党的伪装的人抒发他们的仇恨。每当她预见到教堂要垮台的时候，就会浑身战栗。偶尔她壮胆说上一句愚蠢的话，提出一个观点，而迪布斯基耶瞪她一眼，她就将下半截话咽下去了。","If du Bousquier had a journey to take, she was anxious about his trunk, his linen; she took the most minute precautions for his material benefit.If he went to Prebaudet, she consulted the barometer the evening before to know if the weather would be fine.She watched for his will in his eyes, like a dog which hears and sees its master while sleeping.When the stout du Bousquier, touched by this scrupulous love, would take her round the waist and kiss her forehead, saying, “What a good woman you are!” tears of pleasure would come into the eyes of the poor creature.It is probably that du Bousquier felt himself obliged to make certain concessions which obtained for him the respect of Rose-Marie-Victoire; for Catholic virtue does not require a dissimulation as complete as that of Madame du Bousquier.Often the good saint sat mutely by and listened to the hatred of men who concealed themselves under the cloak of constitutional royalists.She shuddered as she foresaw the ruin of the Church.Occasionally she risked a stupid word, an observation which du Bousquier cut short with a glance."
"如此左右为难的痛苦生活终于让迪布斯基耶夫人变得痴痴傻傻了。她觉得如果只将她的思考集中在内心，甘心过着纯粹动物一样的生活，她会生活得更加简单而有尊严。因此她表现出奴隶般的顺从，并且当她的丈夫将她置于屈从的地位时，她也将其认为是一件值得称赞的行为。执行丈夫的旨意从未引起她的半句怨言。牧羊人一指出道路，这只胆小的羔羊便立刻走上去。她接受各种最严格的天主教徒的修行，她再也没有想过撒旦以及他创造的一切世俗浮华和虚荣。因此，她展现给世人的是集基督徒所有美德于一身的形象，而迪布斯基耶自然成了法兰西和纳瓦尔王国中最幸福的男人之一了。","The worries of such an existence ended by stupefying Madame du Bousquier, who found it easier and also more dignified to concentrate her intelligence on her own thoughts and resign herself to lead a life that was purely animal.She then adopted the submission of a slave, and regarded it as a meritorious deed to accept the degradation in which her husband placed her.The fulfilment of his will never once caused her to murmur.The timid sheep went henceforth in the way the shepherd led her; she gave herself up to the severest religious practices, and thought no more of Satan and his works and vanities.Thus she presented to the eyes of the world a union of all Christian virtues; and du Bousquier was certainly one of the luckiest men in the kingdom of France and of Navarre."
"“她要傻到咽下最后一口气了。”前抵押品总保管说道。他虽然已被撤职，但每周还是在她家吃两次饭。","“She will be a simpleton to her last breath,” said the former collector, who, however, dined with her twice a week."
"如果不交代一下德瓦卢瓦骑士和苏珊的母亲在同一天去世的事，这个故事就太不完整了。骑士于一八三零年八月和君主政体一同死亡。他到诺南库尔去和国王查理十世一行人会合，他和特雷维尔家族、卡泰朗家族和韦纳伊等家族一同虔诚地将国王护送到瑟堡。这位年迈的贵族当时带着他的全部积蓄五万法郎。他将这笔钱交给国王的一位忠实朋友，请他将这笔钱转交给国王，说他已经行将就木，不需要这笔钱了，还说这钱本来也是来自国王陛下的恩赐，并且瓦卢瓦家族最后一员的财产是属于王权的。他这份狂热是否战胜了波旁国王的不情不愿，人们就无从得知了。不过，这位波旁国王放弃了他美丽的法兰西王国，一个子儿也没有带，但是骑士的忠心应该感动了国王。然而，骑士的遗赠财产承受人赛查丽娜确实每年只得到六百法郎的固定收入。骑士由于悲痛和疲惫而变得极其虚弱不堪，回到阿郎松后便卧床不起。在查理十世踏上外国领土的那一天，骑士就断气了。","This history would be strangely incomplete if no mention were made of the coincidence of the Chevalier de Valois’s death occurring at the same time as that of Suzanne’s mother.The chevalier died with the monarchy, in August, 1830.He had joined the cortege of Charles X. at Nonancourt, and piously escorted it to Cherbourg with the Troisvilles, Casterans, d’Esgrignons, Verneuils, etc.The old gentleman had taken with him fifty thousand francs,—the sum to which his savings then amounted.He offered them to one of the faithful friends of the king for transmission to his master, speaking of his approaching death, and declaring that the money came originally from the goodness of the king, and, moreover, that the property of the last of the Valois belonged of right to the crown.It is not known whether the fervor of his zeal conquered the reluctance of the Bourbon, who abandoned his fine kingdom of France without carrying away with him a farthing, and who ought to have been touched by the devotion of the chevalier.It is certain, however, that Cesarine, the residuary legate of the old man, received from his estate only six hundred francs a year.The chevalier returned to Alencon, cruelly weakened by grief and by fatigue; he died on the very day when Charles X arrived on a foreign shore."
"瓦诺布勒夫人和她的保护人当时正害怕会受到自由党的报复。正好苏珊母亲在农村病故，他们俩便高兴地以此为借口，隐姓埋名地去了那个村庄。同时，德瓦卢瓦骑士的遗物正在转卖中，苏珊很想得到她第一个好友也是最后一个好友的一件纪念品，于是骑士那个有名的鼻烟盒的价钱被哄抬起来了，最后她以一千法郎将鼻烟盒买到手。事实上，光是戈里扎公主的肖像就值这个价钱了。两年后，一位专门收集上一世纪精美鼻烟盒的纨绔子弟从瓦诺布勒夫人那儿得到了骑士的那件珍宝。现在这见证了许多爱情和晚年乐事的可爱密友，正陈列在某个私人博物馆里。如果死者能够知道他们死后发生的事，估计骑士连左半边脸都要红了。","Madame du Val-Noble and her protector, who was just then afraid of the vengeance of the liberal party, were glad of a pretext to remain incognito in the village where Suzanne’s mother died.At the sale of the chevalier’s effects, which took place at that time, Suzanne, anxious to obtain a souvenir of her first and last friend, pushed up the price of the famous snuff-box, which was finally knocked down to her for a thousand francs.The portrait of the Princess Goritza was alone worth that sum.Two years later, a young dandy, who was making a collection of the fine snuff-boxes of the last century, obtained from Madame du Val-Noble the chevalier’s treasure.The charming confidant of many a love and the pleasure of an old age is now on exhibition in a species of private museum.If the dead could know what happens after them, the chevalier’s head would surely blush upon its left cheek."
"如果这个故事只是让拥有某些纪念品的人感到对神圣的敬畏，或是让他们采取行动纪念这些曾遗赠给他们幸福的纪念品，那这个故事倒也对骑士风度和爱情问题有很大的昭示作用，但是实际上，这个故事包含的寓意要深刻得多。难道这不表明人们需要接受新型的教育吗？难道这不是在启示公共教育部部长们设立人类学的讲坛吗？他们确实已经感到焦虑了。德国已经在这一门科学上走在我们的前面了。虽然我们已遭受各类神话的困扰，但是现在的神话比古代的神话还更让人难以理解。神话从各方面包围着我们，它们包含各种理论，它们解答所有问题。根据人类的看法，它们是历史的火炬；只要历史教师稍微给外省人们的头脑中灌输一些对于神话的解释，这些神话就能够将王国从各种革命中解救出来了。如果科尔蒙小姐能读书或上学，如果奥恩省里有一位人类学教授，或者科尔蒙小姐读过奥利奥斯托的著作，那她就不会遭受夫妻生活中骇人听闻的种种不幸了。她也许就能知道为什么意大利诗人会安排安杰丽卡更喜欢梅多罗，而不是奥兰多。梅多罗就相当于金发的德瓦卢瓦骑士，而奥兰多对于死去的马却只知道发疯。梅多罗不正是各种女性王国中殷勤臣子的神话形象吗？而奥兰多，不正是混乱、愤怒、破坏一切却无法生产的无力革命的神话象征吗？此为巴郎什先生的一个门徒的见解，我们发表了他的见解，不过不会对此负任何责任。","If this history has no other effect than to inspire the possessors of precious relics with holy fear, and induce them to make codicils to secure these touching souvenirs of joys that are no more by bequeathing them to loving hands, it will have done an immense service to the chivalrous and romantic portion of the community; but it does, in truth, contain a far higher moral.Does it not show the necessity for a new species of education?Does it not invoke, from the enlightened solicitude of the ministers of Public Instruction, the creation of chairs of anthropology,—a science in which Germany outstrips us?Modern myths are even less understood than ancient ones, harried as we are with myths.Myths are pressing us from every point; they serve all theories, they explain all questions.They are, according to human ideas, the torches of history; they would save empires from revolution if only the professors of history would force the explanations they give into the mind of the provincial masses.If Mademoiselle Cormon had been a reader or a student, and if there had existed in the department of the Orne a professor of anthropology, or even had she read Ariosto, the frightful disasters of her conjugal life would never have occurred.She would probably have known why the Italian poet makes Angelica prefer Medoro, who was a blond Chevalier de Valois, to Orlando, whose mare was dead, and who knew no better than to fly into a passion.Is not Medoro the mythic form for all courtiers of feminine royalty, and Orlando the myth of disorderly, furious, and impotent revolutions, which destroy but cannot produce?We publish, but without assuming any responsibility for it, this opinion of a pupil of Monsieur Ballanche."
"关于那雕刻成黑人头形状的钻石耳环的去向，我们则一无所知。至于瓦诺布勒夫人，也许您晚上能在歌剧院里见到她。多亏德瓦卢瓦骑士给予她的启蒙教育，现在她几乎具备了受过良好教养的女人的气质。","No information has reached us as to the fate of the negroes’ heads in diamonds.You may see Madame du Val-Noble every evening at the Opera.Thanks to the education given her by the Chevalier de Valois, she has almost the air of a well-bred woman."
"迪布斯基耶夫人还在世，这岂不是说她还在受苦吗？女人们上了六十岁的年纪，就可以向别人坦白一切了。迪布斯基耶夫人六十岁之后，对迪库徳赖夫人吐露心声说，她从来都不能接受自己要做一辈子老姑娘的想法。","Madame du Bousquier still lives; is not that as much as to say she still suffers?After reaching the age of sixty—the period at which women allow themselves to make confessions—she said confidentially to Madame du Coudrai, that she had never been able to endure the idea of dying an old maid."
