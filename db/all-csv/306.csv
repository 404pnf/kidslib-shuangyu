"第一章","Chapter I"
"在外省的某些城镇，有些房屋的样子让人觉得凄凉，类似于昏暗的修道院、萧索的旷野或荒芜的废墟给人的感觉。也许，在这些房子里，修道院的寂静、旷野的荒芜和废墟的凋败都兼而有之。里面的生活起居是如此沉寂，要不是突然看见窗口有个面孔像修道士的人，一动不动，一听到陌生的脚步声，就会目光暗淡、冷漠地朝窗外瞥上一眼的话，外地人会以为那是些无人居住的空宅。","There are houses in certain provincial towns whose aspect inspires melancholy, akin to that called forth by sombre cloisters, dreary moorlands, or the desolation of ruins.Within these houses there is, perhaps, the silence of the cloister, the barrenness of moors, the skeleton of ruins; life and movement are so stagnant there that a stranger might think them uninhabited, were it not that he encounters suddenly the pale, cold glance of a motionless person, whose half-monastic face peers beyond the window-casing at the sound of an unaccustomed step."
"可以说，索米尔一所住宅的外观就带有这种悲凉的成分，它坐落在一条陡直的街道尽头，那条街道通向城市高处的古堡。这条街道——如今已行人稀少，夏天炎热，冬天寒冷，某些地段很阴暗——很有特点：有回声的小石子路，总是洁净干爽；狭窄的街道弯弯曲曲；街边的房屋属于老城区，低卧在城墙脚下，非常幽静。三百年之久的房屋虽是木质结构，却依然坚固。其形式各异的外观别有风格，使得索米尔城的这个区域颇受艺术家和古董商的青睐。","Such elements of sadness formed the physiognomy, as it were, of a dwelling-house in Saumur which stands at the end of the steep street leading to the chateau in the upper part of the town.This street—now little frequented, hot in summer, cold in winter, dark in certain sections—is remarkable for the resonance of its little pebbly pavement, always clean and dry, for the narrowness of its tortuous road-way, for the peaceful stillness of its houses, which belong to the old town and are over-topped by the ramparts.Houses three centuries old are still solid, though built of wood, and their divers aspects add to the originality which commends this portion of Saumur to the attention of artists and antiquaries."
"经过这些房屋时，很难不去赞叹那些巨大的栎木横梁，它们的两头被雕成奇特的造型，它们和一条黑色的浅浮雕一起覆盖在多数房屋的底层顶端。在某个地方，这些横木上盖着石板，在房子不大结实的墙上勾出一道淡蓝色的线条，其木柱支撑的屋顶因年久而被压弯，腐朽的墙面板由于日晒雨淋的交替作用也已经扭曲变形。在另一个地方，破旧的窗台发了黑，上面精巧的雕刻现在已模糊难辨，显得非常不结实，似乎都承受不住某个贫苦女工放上去的栽着心安草或是蔷薇丛的棕色陶盆。再往远处，是些镶着硕大钉子的门，上面有我们的天才祖先们留下的家传象形文字，文字的意义现在是永远无法知晓了。有的是一个新教徒在证明他的信仰；有的是反新教盟员在诅咒亨利四世；还有的则是某个资产阶级刻下的钟形贵族徽章，以彰显他早已被人遗忘的当过地方长官的荣耀。法国的整部历史都在这里。","It is difficult to pass these houses without admiring the enormous oaken beams, their ends carved into fantastic figures, which crown with a black bas-relief the lower floor of most of them.In one place these transverse timbers are covered with slate and mark a bluish line along the frail wall of a dwelling covered by a roof @en colombage@ which bends beneath the weight of years, and whose rotting shingles are twisted by the alternate action of sun and rain.In another place blackened, worn-out window-sills, with delicate sculptures now scarcely discernible, seem too weak to bear the brown clay pots from which springs the heart’s-ease or the rose-bush of some poor working-woman.Farther on are doors studded with enormous nails, where the genius of our forefathers has traced domestic hieroglyphics, of which the meaning is now lost forever.Here a Protestant attested his belief; there a Leaguer cursed Henry IV.; elsewhere some bourgeois has carved the insignia of his @noblesse de cloches@, symbols of his long-forgotten magisterial glory.The whole history of France is there."
"一幢墙壁被粉刷得很粗糙的摇摇晃晃的房屋俨然成了工匠卖弄手艺的地方。旁边矗立着一位乡绅的宅邸，门楣石拱上的贵族徽章，历经一七八九年以来席卷法国的数次大革命的摧残，其遗迹仍依稀可辨。在这条坡势很陡的街道上，商铺的底层既不是商店，也不是仓库，喜欢中世纪的人会发现，这里就像我们祖先的缝纫工场一样，保持着古朴简易的风貌。这些低矮的房屋没有门面，也没有橱窗，实际上一块玻璃都没装，它们进深长，而且阴暗，里外都没有任何装饰。房门分成两截开，每一截都简陋地包着铁皮，上半截固定住往屋里开，下半截装有弹簧门铃，不断地来回开进开出。空气和光线从门的上半截，或是从屋顶和齐胸高的低矮前墙之间的空隙透进那潮湿的小屋子。前墙上封着结实的百叶窗，每天早晨卸下，夜晚装上，并用粗重的铁条固定住。","Next to a tottering house with roughly plastered walls, where an artisan enshrines his tools, rises the mansion of a country gentleman, on the stone arch of which above the door vestiges of armorial bearings may still be seen, battered by the many revolutions that have shaken France since 1789.In this hilly street the ground-floors of the merchants are neither shops nor warehouses; lovers of the Middle Ages will here find the @ouvrouere @of our forefathers in all its naive simplicity.These low rooms, which have no shop-frontage, no show-windows, in fact no glass at all, are deep and dark and without interior or exterior decoration.Their doors open in two parts, each roughly iron-bound; the upper half is fastened back within the room, the lower half, fitted with a spring-bell, swings continually to and fro.Air and light reach the damp den within, either through the upper half of the door, or through an open space between the ceiling and a low front wall, breast-high, which is closed by solid shutters that are taken down every morning, put up every evening, and held in place by heavy iron bars."
"这堵墙用来作陈列商品的柜台。这里绝无任何哄骗人的招数，只摆着货物样品，不管卖的是什么货——比如说，满满三四桶鳕鱼和盐、几捆帆布、绳索、吊在托梁上的铜丝、沿墙摆放的木桶铁箍，或者是摆在架子上的几块布料。顾客推门进来。一个整洁的姑娘年轻亮丽，头戴白色方巾，赤裸的胳膊通红，她放下手里的毛线活，唤来她的父亲或是母亲，他们中的一位会上前卖给你想要的东西，也许是两个苏的买卖，也许是两万法郎的生意，他们的态度或者冷淡，或者殷勤，或者傲慢，全看他或她的个性了。你可能会看到一个箍桶匠，比如说，正坐在门口，绕着他的大拇指跟一个邻居聊天。表面上，他只有少得可怜的酒瓶架和两三捆板条，但是在下面的码头里，他的木材场堆满了货，足以供应整个安茹的桶匠业。他知道如果葡萄酒丰产，会需要多少木桶，乃至多少板材。炎热的季节会让他发财，阴雨的季节会让他亏本；仅一个早上，酒桶的价钱可能会从十一法郎跌至六法郎。这个地方和图赖讷一样，天气的变化无常左右着商业的行情。种葡萄的人、有田产的人、木材商、箍桶匠、客栈老板、水手，都盼着出太阳。晚上睡觉时他们忐忑不安，唯恐早上会听说夜里起了霜；他们怕雨、怕风、怕旱，希望雨水、温度和云雾都能符合他们的愿望。在天公和他们这些凡人的利益之间是没完没了的斗争。晴雨表让他们的表情变来变去，他们时而欣慰，时而忧伤，时而快乐。这条街道从前是索米尔大街，从街头到街尾，“金子般的好天气”这句话会挨家挨户地传；有时每个人都会对他的邻居大声说：","This wall serves as a counter for the merchandise.No delusive display is there; only samples of the business, whatever it may chance to be,—such, for instance, as three or four tubs full of codfish and salt, a few bundles of sail-cloth, cordage, copper wire hanging from the joists above, iron hoops for casks ranged along the wall, or a few pieces of cloth upon the shelves.Enter.A neat girl, glowing with youth, wearing a white kerchief, her arms red and bare, drops her knitting and calls her father or her mother, one of whom comes forward and sells you what you want, phlegmatically, civilly, or arrogantly, according to his or her individual character, whether it be a matter of two sous’ or twenty thousand francs’ worth of merchandise.You may see a cooper, for instance, sitting in his doorway and twirling his thumbs as he talks with a neighbor.To all appearance he owns nothing more than a few miserable boat-ribs and two or three bundles of laths; but below in the port his teeming wood-yard supplies all the cooperage trade of Anjou.He knows to a plank how many casks are needed if the vintage is good.A hot season makes him rich, a rainy season ruins him; in a single morning puncheons worth eleven francs have been known to drop to six.In this country, as in Touraine, atmospheric vicissitudes control commercial life.Wine-growers, proprietors, wood-merchants, coopers, inn-keepers, mariners, all keep watch of the sun.They tremble when they go to bed lest they should hear in the morning of a frost in the night; they dread rain, wind, drought, and want water, heat, and clouds to suit their fancy.A perpetual duel goes on between the heavens and their terrestrial interests.The barometer smooths, saddens, or makes merry their countenances, turn and turn about.From end to end of this street, formerly the Grand’Rue de Saumur, the words: “Here’s golden weather,” are passed from door to door; or each man calls to his neighbor: "
"“老天下金路易了。”他们很清楚一缕阳光或者一场及时雨会带来什么样的好处。","“It rains louis,” knowing well what a sunbeam or the opportune rainfall is bringing him."
"天气晴朗的季节，到了星期六的午后，就别想从这些优秀的商人手中买到哪怕一个苏的商品。他们每个人都有自己的葡萄园和一片园地，而且全要在乡下呆上两天。这一切都事先算计好了，买进、卖出和利润都已经做了预算，商人们足可以花十或十二个小时欢聚、谈天说地、评头论足、不停地打探别人的隐私。一个主妇买了山鹑，邻居们就会问她丈夫山鹑是否烧到了火候。一个年轻姑娘把头靠近窗户，这绝不会逃过街上闲人的眼睛。道德良知暴露在光天化日之下，就像那些房子，虽然表面阴暗、寂静、无从窥视，却藏不了什么秘密。生活几乎全部在露天下，每家每户都会坐在自家门槛上，在那里吃早饭、吃晚饭，还吵架拌嘴。没有人能从大街上走一遭而不被人评头论足的。实际上，从前每当一个外乡人进了一个外省的城镇，总会到处被人戏耍捉弄。由此便有了许多有趣的故事，而绰号“丰富的”就被加到了昂热居民的头上，他们对这种市井的嘲讽挖苦很拿手。","On Saturdays after midday, in the fine season, not one sou’s worth of merchandise can be bought from these worthy traders.Each has his vineyard, his enclosure of fields, and all spend two days in the country.This being foreseen, and purchases, sales, and profits provided for, the merchants have ten or twelve hours to spend in parties of pleasure, in making observations, in criticisms, and in continual spying.A housewife cannot buy a partridge without the neighbors asking the husband if it were cooked to a turn.A young girl never puts her head near a window that she is not seen by idling groups in the street.Consciences are held in the light; and the houses, dark, silent, impenetrable as they seem, hide no mysteries.Life is almost wholly in the open air; every household sits at its own threshold, breakfasts, dines, and quarrels there.No one can pass along the street without being examined; in fact formerly, when a stranger entered a provincial town he was bantered and made game of from door to door.From this came many good stories, and the nickname @copieux@, which was applied to the inhabitants of Angers, who excelled in such urban sarcasms."
"索米尔旧城的古老宅邸都在这条陡街的高处，从前是贵族居住区。以下历史事件就发生在其中一座凄凉的宅子里——可谓珍贵的百年历史遗迹，其中的人和物带有简单纯朴的特点，这正是法兰西的风俗习性日渐失去的东西。沿着这条风景如画的大街蜿蜒而上，其曲折幽回会勾起某些回忆，使人的思绪不由自主地陷入遐想之中，然后你会看到一个有点黑暗的幽深处，中间藏着葛朗台先生府邸的大门。如果不介绍一下葛朗台先生的身世，是不可能明白这个外省词语——葛朗台先生的府邸——有多大的分量。","The ancient mansions of the old town of Saumur are at the top of this hilly street, and were formerly occupied by the nobility of the neighborhood.The melancholy dwelling where the events of the following history took place is one of these mansions,—venerable relics of a century in which men and things bore the characteristics of simplicity which French manners and customs are losing day by day.Follow the windings of the picturesque thoroughfare, whose irregularities awaken recollections that plunge the mind mechanically into reverie, and you will see a somewhat dark recess, in the centre of which is hidden the door of the house of Monsieur Grandet.It is impossible to understand the force of this provincial expression—the house of Monsieur Grandet—without giving the biography of Monsieur Grandet himself."
"葛朗台先生在索米尔颇有名望，那些没有偶尔去外省呆过的人是永远无法完全理解这种名望产生的前因后果。一七八九年，葛朗台先生——还仍然被某些人称作葛朗台老头，尽管这样称呼他的老人的数量已明显减少——是个手艺高明的箍桶匠，能读，能写，还会算。当时正值法兰西共和国在出售索米尔郡的教堂产权，这个箍桶匠当时四十岁，刚刚娶了一位有钱的木材商的女儿。拿着他自己手头的现钱和妻子的陪嫁，总计约两千金路易，葛朗台去了新成立的“区”，在那里，靠着把岳父给的四百金路易送给那个凶恶的共和党人——这个人主管着国有地产的出售，葛朗台非常廉价地、虽不合理却合法地得到了郡里最好的葡萄园、一座老修道院和几块农田。","Monsieur Grandet enjoyed a reputation in Saumur whose causes and effects can never be fully understood by those who have not, at one time or another, lived in the provinces.In 1789 Monsieur Grandet—still called by certain persons le Pere Grandet, though the number of such old persons has perceptibly diminished—was a master-cooper, able to read, write, and cipher.At the period when the French Republic offered for sale the church property in the arrondissement of Saumur, the cooper, then forty years of age, had just married the daughter of a rich wood-merchant.Supplied with the ready money of his own fortune and his wife’s @dot@, in all about two thousand louis-d’or, Grandet went to the newly established “district,” where, with the help of two hundred double louis given by his father-in-law to the surly republican who presided over the sales of the national domain, he obtained for a song, legally if not legitimately, one of the finest vineyards in the arrondissement, an old abbey, and several farms."
"索米尔居民的革命意识很淡薄，所以他们把葛朗台老头看成了一个有胆识的人，一个共和党人和一个乐于接受一切新思想的爱国者，尽管实际上他只关心葡萄园。他被任命为索米尔行政委员，于是当地人在政治上和商业上都感受到了他温和的影响力。政治上，他包庇从前的贵族，竭尽所能阻挠拍卖流亡贵族的土地和财产；商业上，他为共和党军队提供了两三千桶的白葡萄酒，换取了原属于一个女修道院的几块良田，这些地本来是留作最后一批拍卖的。","The inhabitants of Saumur were so little revolutionary that they thought Pere Grandet a bold man, a republican, and a patriot with a mind open to all the new ideas; though in point of fact it was open only to vineyards.He was appointed a member of the administration of Saumur, and his pacific influence made itself felt politically and commercially.Politically, he protected the ci-devant nobles, and prevented, to the extent of his power, the sale of the lands and property of the @emigres@; commercially, he furnished the Republican armies with two or three thousand puncheons of white wine, and took his pay in splendid fields belonging to a community of women whose lands had been reserved for the last lot."
"在执政府时期，葛朗台当了市长，他治理有方，葡萄的收成也更好了。在帝国时期，他被称为葛朗台先生。不过，拿破仑不喜欢共和党，派了一个自己圈子里的人，也是一个帝国未来的男爵将葛朗台先生取而代之（他被认为曾经戴过弗里吉亚软帽）。葛朗台先生失去了职务，却毫不惋惜。为了本城的利益，他修了几条好路，直通自己的地产；他的房子和土地在评估时占了很大便宜，只缴纳了很少的税；自从他各处的庄园登记之后，那些葡萄园在他不断的悉心照料下，已经变成了“当地的头筹”——一个当地词，用来指代那些生产上等好酒的葡萄园。他简直可以申请荣誉团的十字勋章了。","Under the Consulate Grandet became mayor, governed wisely, and harvested still better pickings.Under the Empire he was called Monsieur Grandet.Napoleon, however, did not like republicans, and superseded Monsieur Grandet (who was supposed to have worn the Phrygian cap) by a man of his own surroundings, a future baron of the Empire.Monsieur Grandet quitted office without regret.He had constructed in the interests of the town certain fine roads which led to his own property; his house and lands, very advantageously assessed, paid moderate taxes; and since the registration of his various estates, the vineyards, thanks to his constant care, had become the “head of the country,”—a local term used to denote those that produced the finest quality of wine.He might have asked for the cross of the Legion of honor."
"这一事件发生在一八零六年。葛朗台先生当时五十七岁，他的妻子三十六岁，他们十岁的独生女儿是他们合法爱情的结晶。上天无疑是希望补偿葛朗台先生丢官的损失，这一年他继承了三笔遗产：有葛朗台太太的母亲，生于德拉贝尔特利耶家的德拉戈迪尼埃夫人的遗产；有葛朗台太太的外公，老德拉贝尔特利耶先生的遗产；最后是葛朗台太太的外婆，让蒂耶夫人的遗产。这三笔遗产的数目无人知晓。","This event occurred in 1806.Monsieur Grandet was then fifty-seven years of age, his wife thirty-six, and an only daughter, the fruit of their legitimate love, was ten years old.Monsieur Grandet, whom Providence no doubt desired to compensate for the loss of his municipal honors, inherited three fortunes in the course of this year,—that of Madame de la Gaudiniere, born de la Bertelliere, the mother of Madame Grandet; that of old Monsieur de la Bertelliere, her grandfather; and, lastly, that of Madame Gentillet, her grandmother on the mother’s side: three inheritances, whose amount was not known to any one."
"这几位仙逝者都贪婪成性，很长时间他们存钱的目的就是为了私下里偷偷看着高兴。老德拉贝尔特利耶先生把投资叫做挥霍，认为看见他的金子所得到的好处比高利贷的利润还要多。索米尔的居民们因而根据“太阳照得见的财产收入”——照他们的说法——估算了他的积蓄。","The avarice of the deceased persons was so keen that for a long time they had hoarded their money for the pleasure of secretly looking at it.Old Monsieur de la Bertelliere called an investment an extravagance, and thought he got better interest from the sight of his gold than from the profits of usury.The inhabitants of Saumur consequently estimated his savings according to “the revenues of the sun’s wealth,” as they said."
"葛朗台先生于是获得了那个时髦的贵族头衔，这是我们热衷平等的狂热分子永远也消灭不了的东西。他成了本郡最显赫的人物。他经营着一百英亩的葡萄园，在收成好的年份，可以产七八百桶葡萄酒。他拥有十三个农场、一座老修道院，为了节约，他把修道院的窗户和拱门都用墙堵死了，这是保护这些东西的一个方法。他还有一百二十七英亩草场，那里有一七九三年种下的三千棵杨树，长得枝繁叶茂。最后，就是他住的那所宅子了。　这是他的可见财产，至于他的其他资产，只有两个人能模模糊糊估算出价值来：一位是克吕绍先生，受雇为葛朗台先生管理高利贷投资的公证人；另一位是德格拉桑先生，索米尔最富有的银行家，葛朗台在其利润中立约秘密持有一份。","Monsieur Grandet thus obtained that modern title of nobility which our mania for equality can never rub out.He became the most imposing personage in the arrondissement.He worked a hundred acres of vineyard, which in fruitful years yielded seven or eight hundred hogsheads of wine.He owned thirteen farms, an old abbey, whose windows and arches he had walled up for the sake of economy,—a measure which preserved them,—also a hundred and twenty-seven acres of meadow-land, where three thousand poplars, planted in 1793, grew and flourished; and finally, the house in which he lived.Such was his visible estate; as to his other property, only two persons could give even a vague guess at its value: one was Monsieur Cruchot, a notary employed in the usurious investments of Monsieur Grandet; the other was Monsieur des Grassins, the richest banker in Saumur, in whose profits Grandet had a certain covenanted and secret share."
"尽管老克吕绍和德格拉桑先生二人素来都非常谨慎，这在外省是谋求财富和信任的保证，由于他们在公开场合对葛朗台先生表现得非常尊敬，旁观者免不了会以他们这种毕恭毕敬的态度来推测葛朗台的资产数目。在整个索米尔，所有人都相信葛朗台先生有个秘密宝库，一个藏满了金路易的密室，晚上他会在密室里瞧着大堆的金子，那高兴劲儿真是难以形容。贪婪的人们都认为此事证据确凿，因为他们看到这个老头的眼睛里似乎都闪着黄色金属的色彩。一个习惯于从资本中赚取巨额利润的人，其目光就像浪荡子、赌徒或阿谀奉承者一样，有着某些难以名状的习惯——鬼鬼祟祟、贪婪、行色神秘，这一切从来都逃不过同道人的眼睛。这种暗语在某种程度上就是贪欲者之间的默契。葛朗台先生受人尊重，因为他从不欠债，既是技艺精湛的箍桶匠，又是经验丰富的葡萄园主，他可以像天文学家一样精确地推算出是该做上一千只桶来装他的葡萄酒，还是只要五百只桶；他做投机生意从来没有失过手，在酒桶比里面装的酒还贵时，他总有酒桶出售，他会把全部的酒囤储到自己的酒窖里，等待良机，直至每桶市价两百法郎才出手，而小业主们却早已被迫每桶五个路易就抛售掉了。","Although old Cruchot and Monsieur des Grassins were both gifted with the deep discretion which wealth and trust beget in the provinces, they publicly testified so much respect to Monsieur Grandet that observers estimated the amount of his property by the obsequious attention which they bestowed upon him.In all Saumur there was no one not persuaded that Monsieur Grandet had a private treasure, some hiding-place full of louis, where he nightly took ineffable delight in gazing upon great masses of gold.Avaricious people gathered proof of this when they looked at the eyes of the good man, to which the yellow metal seemed to have conveyed its tints.The glance of a man accustomed to draw enormous interest from his capital acquires, like that of the libertine, the gambler, or the sycophant, certain indefinable habits,—furtive, eager, mysterious movements, which never escape the notice of his co-religionists.This secret language is in a certain way the freemasonry of the passions.Monsieur Grandet inspired the respectful esteem due to one who owed no man anything, who, skilful cooper and experienced wine-grower that he was, guessed with the precision of an astronomer whether he ought to manufacture a thousand puncheons for his vintage, or only five hundred, who never failed in any speculation, and always had casks for sale when casks were worth more than the commodity that filled them, who could store his whole vintage in his cellars and bide his time to put the puncheons on the market at two hundred francs, when the little proprietors had been forced to sell theirs for five louis."
"一八一一年他做了笔有名的葡萄酒买卖，他先明智地囤积了酒，再慢慢地出手，赚了二十四万多法郎。","His famous vintage of 1811, judiciously stored and slowly disposed of, brought him in more than two hundred and forty thousand francs."
"从理财上来讲，葛朗台先生既像老虎，又像巨蟒。他可以蜷伏着，趴得低低的，长时间地观察着他的猎物，扑上去，张开大口，吞下一堆金路易，然后像一条正在消化食物的蛇一样静静地卧着，不动声色，有条不紊，而且冷酷。看见他经过时，所有人都会怀有一种掺杂着敬重和畏惧的钦佩之情；在索米尔，每个人不都曾有过被那双擦得锃亮的钢铁利爪抓过的感觉吗？比如这个人，通过克吕绍公证人获取了购买地产所需的贷款，但利息是百分之十一。还有那个人，让德格拉桑先生给贴现汇票，但被扣除了极大一笔利息。不管是在市场，还是在晚间聚会的闲谈中，很少有哪天葛朗台先生的名字不被提到。对有些人来说，这个老葡萄园主的财富成了当地的骄傲。不只一个商人、一个客栈老板曾用某种得意的口吻对外地人说：","Financially speaking, Monsieur Grandet was something between a tiger and a boa constrictor.He could crouch and lie low, watch his prey a long while, spring upon it, open his jaws, swallow a mass of louis, and then rest tranquilly like a snake in process of digestion, impassible, methodical, and cold.No one saw him pass without a feeling of admiration mingled with respect and fear; had not every man in Saumur felt the rending of those polished steel claws?For this one, Maitre Cruchot had procured the money required for the purchase of a domain, but at eleven per cent.For that one, Monsieur des Grassins discounted bills of exchange, but at a frightful deduction of interest.Few days ever passed that Monsieur Grandet’s name was not mentioned either in the markets or in social conversations at the evening gatherings.To some the fortune of the old wine-grower was an object of patriotic pride.More than one merchant, more than one innkeeper, said to strangers with a certain complacency:"
"“先生，我们有两三家百万富翁，但是要说葛朗台先生，连他自己都不知道自己有多少家产。”"," “Monsieur, we have two or three millionaire establishments; but as for Monsieur Grandet, he does not himself know how much he is worth.”"
"一八一六年，索米尔最精于计算的人估算这个有钱人的地产约值四百万，但是从一七九三年至一八一七年，因为他平均每年从地产中能赚十万法郎，照此推算，他拥有的现金数额同他的不动产价值相差无几。所以，每当打完一局波士顿牌或者夜里聊完葡萄藤方面的事之后，话题就会落到葛朗台先生的身上，那些消息灵通的人说道：","In 1816 the best reckoners in Saumur estimated the landed property of the worthy man at nearly four millions; but as, on an average, he had made yearly, from 1793 to 1817, a hundred thousand francs out of that property, it was fair to presume that he possessed in actual money a sum nearly equal to the value of his estate.So that when, after a game of boston or an evening discussion on the matter of vines, the talk fell upon Monsieur Grandet, knowing people said: "
"“葛朗台老头吗？葛朗台老头至少该有五六百万吧。”","“Le Pere Grandet? Le Pere Grandet must have at least five or six millions.”"
"每当克吕绍先生或者德格拉桑先生碰巧听见这番话时，就会回答道：“你们比我聪明，我还从来没搞清数目是多少呢。”","“You are cleverer than I am; I have never been able to find out the amount,” answered Monsieur Cruchot or Monsieur des Grassins, when either chanced to overhear the remark."
"如果有哪个巴黎人提到了罗思柴尔德或者拉菲特先生，索米尔人就会问，他是不是和葛朗台先生一样有钱。当那个巴黎人微微一笑，轻蔑地予以肯定时，他们就会相互看着对方，摇摇头，一副不相信的神情。这么大一笔财产给这个人的所有行为披上了一件金斗篷。如果说早先他生活中的某些古怪之处曾遭人取笑或嘲弄的话，那么这些取笑或嘲弄早已不复存在。他随便一个举动，其结果都会反复显示出权威性。他的言谈、他的衣着、他的手势、他眼睛的眨动就是当地的法则，那里的每个人像博物学家研究低等动物本能的作用一样把他研究过一番之后，开始了解到在他最琐碎的举动中那深邃、无声的智慧。","If some Parisian mentioned Rothschild or Monsieur Lafitte, the people of Saumur asked if he were as rich as Monsieur Grandet.When the Parisian, with a smile, tossed them a disdainful affirmative, they looked at each other and shook their heads with an incredulous air.So large a fortune covered with a golden mantle all the actions of this man.If in early days some peculiarities of his life gave occasion for laughter or ridicule, laughter and ridicule had long since died away.His least important actions had the authority of results repeatedly shown.His speech, his clothing, his gestures, the blinking of his eyes, were law to the countryside, where every one, after studying him as a naturalist studies the result of instinct in the lower animals, had come to understand the deep mute wisdom of his slightest actions."
"“今年冬天会很冷的，”有人说道，“葛朗台老头已经戴上他的皮手套了。”","“It will be a hard winter,” said one, “Pere Grandet has put on his fur gloves.”"
"“葛朗台老头正在买大量的板材，今年的葡萄酒产量一定高。”","“Pere Grandet is buying quantities of staves; there will be plenty of wine this year.”"
"葛朗台先生从不买面包，也不买肉。他的佃户们每星期会给他供应充足的阉鸡、鸡肉、鸡蛋、黄油和抵租的小麦。他有一家磨房，租用者除了交租金外，还必须拿一定数量的麦子去磨，然后给他送回来面粉和麦麸。他唯一的佣人大个子娜农，尽管已不年轻，每个星期六仍要自己烤出全家人吃的面包。葛朗台先生分派佃户中种菜的给他供应蔬菜。至于水果，收成多到他得把大部分都拿到市场上去卖掉。他的柴火是从他自己的灌木树篱里砍回来的，或是从他盖在他田头那些接近腐烂的旧棚子中取回的，佃户们把其中的板子用车给他拉进城，然后锯开，热情地垛进他的柴房，换回他几声谢谢。他唯一为人所知的开销用在了圣餐面包、他太太和女儿的衣着、教堂座椅的租用费、大个子娜农的工资、锅具的镀锡、照明、纳税、房屋修理和他各种产业的费用上面。他有六百英亩林地，是最近刚买的，他劝说邻居的看林人看护，并许诺给些补助。在获取了这份资产之后，他第一次吃上了野味。","Monsieur Grandet never bought either bread or meat.His farmers supplied him weekly with a sufficiency of capons, chickens, eggs, butter, and his tithe of wheat.He owned a mill; and the tenant was bound, over and above his rent, to take a certain quantity of grain and return him the flour and bran.La Grande Nanon, his only servant, though she was no longer young, baked the bread of the household herself every Saturday.Monsieur Grandet arranged with kitchen-gardeners who were his tenants to supply him with vegetables.As to fruits, he gathered such quantities that he sold the greater part in the market.His firewood was cut from his own hedgerows or taken from the half-rotten old sheds which he built at the corners of his fields, and whose planks the farmers carted into town for him, all cut up, and obligingly stacked in his wood-house, receiving in return his thanks.His only known expenditures were for the consecrated bread, the clothing of his wife and daughter, the hire of their chairs in church, the wages of la Grand Nanon, the tinning of the saucepans, lights, taxes, repairs on his buildings, and the costs of his various industries.He had six hundred acres of woodland, lately purchased, which he induced a neighbor’s keeper to watch, under the promise of an indemnity.After the acquisition of this property he ate game for the first time."
"葛朗台先生的举止非常简单。他很少说话。他通常会用短而简洁的语句来表达自己的意思，说话时声音轻柔。大革命之后，那正是他崭露头角的时期，每当被人要求发表长篇大论或是陈述某个观点时，这个老头就会结结巴巴，令人生厌。他说话口齿不清、语无伦次、滔滔不绝、词不达意，明显缺乏逻辑，这被人们归咎于教育的欠缺，而实际上这都是他装出来的，下面的某些历史事件会把其缘由全都解释清的。有四个像代数公式一样精确的句子，通常足以让他把握并解决生活和商业上的所有难题：“我不知道；我不能；我不会；以后再说。”他从不说是或者不是，也从不留字据。如果人们跟他说话，他就冷冷地听着，右手托着下巴，右胳膊肘放在左手背上，对任何事情，他的脑子里要是有了主意，就再也不改了。在签订任何买卖协议之前，他都会考虑很长时间。当他的对手在小心商谈之后，透露了自己隐藏的意图时，满以为已经获得了听者的同意，葛朗台却回答道：","Monsieur Grandet’s manners were very simple.He spoke little.He usually expressed his meaning by short sententious phrases uttered in a soft voice.After the Revolution, the epoch at which he first came into notice, the good man stuttered in a wearisome way as soon as he was required to speak at length or to maintain an argument.This stammering, the incoherence of his language, the flux of words in which he drowned his thought, his apparent lack of logic, attributed to defects of education, were in reality assumed, and will be sufficiently explained by certain events in the following history.Four sentences, precise as algebraic formulas, sufficed him usually to grasp and solve all difficulties of life and commerce: “I don’t know; I cannot; I will not; I will see about it.”He never said yes, or no, and never committed himself to writing.If people talked to him he listened coldly, holding his chin in his right hand and resting his right elbow in the back of his left hand, forming in his own mind opinions on all matters, from which he never receded.He reflected long before making any business agreement.When his opponent, after careful conversation, avowed the secret of his own purposes, confident that he had secured his listener’s assent, Grandet answered: "
"“不征求我太太的意见，我什么也决定不了。”","“I can decide nothing without consulting my wife.”"
"他的妻子受他压制，被他当无能的奴隶使唤，是他生意上一个有用的挡箭牌。他从不去朋友家；他既不办晚宴，也不接受宴请；他既不惹事生非，也不大声喧哗，似乎什么都要节省，甚至包括动作。出于对财产所有权的尊重，他从不乱翻乱动别人的东西。然而，尽管他声音轻柔，尽管他举止谨慎，他粗俗的言谈和习惯还是会流露出来，尤其是在他自己的家里，他不会像在别处那么克制自己。","His wife, whom he had reduced to a state of helpless slavery, was a useful screen to him in business.He went nowhere among friends; he neither gave nor accepted dinners; he made no stir or noise, seeming to economize in everything, even movement.He never disturbed or disarranged the things of other people, out of respect for the rights of property.Nevertheless, in spite of his soft voice, in spite of his circumspect bearing, the language and habits of a coarse nature came to the surface, especially in his own home, where he controlled himself less than elsewhere."
"体格上，葛朗台是个身高五英尺的男子，体格粗壮，体型宽阔，小腿肚周长足有十二英寸，膝关节突出，肩膀很宽；他的脸是圆的，呈深褐色，留有天花疤痕的麻点；他的下巴平直，嘴唇没有曲线，牙齿很白；他的眼睛有种镇定、贪婪的神情，就是人们认为蛇怪才有的那种样子；他的额头布满横向的皱纹，还有一些凸起的大包在上面；他的头发黄中带灰，被一些不知好歹、敢开葛朗台先生玩笑的年轻人说成是银子和金子。","Physically, Grandet was a man five feet high, thick-set, square-built, with calves twelve inches in circumference, knotted knee-joints, and broad shoulders; his face was round, tanned, and pitted by the small-pox; his chin was straight, his lips had no curves, his teeth were white; his eyes had that calm, devouring expression which people attribute to the basilisk; his forehead, full of transverse wrinkles, was not without certain significant protuberances; his yellow-grayish hair was said to be silver and gold by certain young people who did not realize the impropriety of making a jest about Monsieur Grandet."
"他的鼻头肥大，上面长着一个能看得见血管的肉瘤，一般人都说那里面装满了恶毒，倒也不无道理。这整副面孔显示出了一种阴险狡诈、一种毫无温情的诚实、一个男人的自私自利，长期以来，他全部的感情都放在贪婪所带来的乐趣和他唯一真正关心的人的身上，那就是他唯一的继承人——他的女儿欧仁妮。简而言之，他的态度、行为、举手投足，他身上的一切都表明了他只相信自己，这是生意上的左右逢源让一个人养成的习惯。","His nose, thick at the end, bore a veined wen, which the common people said, not without reason, was full of malice.The whole countenance showed a dangerous cunning, an integrity without warmth, the egotism of a man long used to concentrate every feeling upon the enjoyments of avarice and upon the only human being who was anything whatever to him,—his daughter and sole heiress, Eugenie.Attitude, manners, bearing, everything about him, in short, testified to that belief in himself which the habit of succeeding in all enterprises never fails to give to a man."
"因而，尽管表面上葛朗台先生的举止油滑、温和，然而他的本质却是硬如铁石。他的装束永远不变；那些今天见着他的人看到的就是他从一七九一年以来一直不变的样子。他肥大的鞋子系着皮质鞋带；无论什么天气，他都穿着厚厚的羊毛长袜、钉着银纽扣的褐色粗布短马裤、一件黄褐条相间、双排扣的天鹅绒马甲、一件下摆宽大的紫褐色大外套，戴一条黑领带和一顶教友会的帽子。他的手套和警察的一样结实，能用上二十个月；为了保护这副手套，他总是井然有序地放在帽檐上一个固定的位置。索米尔人对这个人物的了解就是这么多。","Thus, though his manners were unctuous and soft outwardly, Monsieur Grandet’s nature was of iron.His dress never varied; and those who saw him today saw him such as he had been since 1791.His stout shoes were tied with leathern thongs; he wore, in all weathers, thick woollen stockings, short breeches of coarse maroon cloth with silver buckles, a velvet waistcoat, in alternate stripes of yellow and puce, buttoned squarely, a large maroon coat with wide flaps, a black cravat, and a quaker’s hat.His gloves, thick as those of a gendarme, lasted him twenty months; to preserve them, he always laid them methodically on the brim of his hat in one particular spot.Saumur knew nothing further about this personage."
"只有六个人有权进入葛朗台先生的家中。前三位当中最重要的人物是克吕绍先生的侄子。自从他被任命为索米尔民事法庭庭长以后，这个年轻人就在克吕绍的姓上加了蓬丰这个名。他现在把名签作克·德蓬丰。任何冒冒失失称他为克吕绍先生的诉讼人很快会在出庭时认识到自己的愚蠢。这个执法官保护那些叫他庭长先生的人，但是他会带着慈祥的微笑袒护那些称他为德蓬丰先生的人。庭长先生三十三岁，拥有名为蓬丰的庄园（博尼·丰蒂斯），每年收入七千法郎。他希望将来继承他那个当公证人的叔叔和另一个叔叔——图尔市圣-马丁教堂教务会的要员——克吕绍神父的财产，这两位是公认的富户。这三位克吕绍靠许多本家兄弟撑腰，又和城里二十户人家沾亲带故，于是便形成了一个帮派，犹如佛罗伦萨的梅迪契家族。同梅迪契家族一样，克吕绍家族有他们自己的像帕奇家族一样的仇敌。","Only six individuals had a right of entrance to Monsieur Grandet’s house.The most important of the first three was a nephew of Monsieur Cruchot.Since his appointment as president of the Civil courts of Saumur this young man had added the name of Bonfons to that of Cruchot.He now signed himself C. de Bonfons.Any litigant so ill-advised as to call him Monsieur Cruchot would soon be made to feel his folly in court.The magistrate protected those who called him Monsieur le president, but he favored with gracious smiles those who addressed him as Monsieur de Bonfons.Monsieur le president was thirty-three years old, and possessed the estate of Bonfons (Boni Fontis), worth seven thousand francs a year; he expected to inherit the property of his uncle the notary and that of another uncle, the Abbe Cruchot, a dignitary of the chapter of Saint-Martin de Tours, both of whom were thought to be very rich.These three Cruchots, backed by a goodly number of cousins, and allied to twenty families in the town, formed a party, like the Medici in Florence; like the Medici, the Cruchots had their Pazzi."
"德格拉桑太太是一个二十三岁的儿子的母亲，她经常殷勤地来和葛朗台太太玩牌，希望她亲爱的阿道夫能和欧仁妮小姐结婚。银行家德格拉桑先生通过不断地为那个老吝啬鬼暗中效劳来竭力促成他妻子的计划，并总是在紧要关头及时赶到战场。这三位德格拉桑同样也有他们自己的亲信、本家兄弟和忠实的盟友。在克吕绍这一方，神父是家族中如塔列朗一般的智囊，靠着他的那位公证人兄弟的全力支持，他和他的女对手寸土必争，竭力为他的庭长侄子争夺那位富有的女继承人。","Madame des Grassins, mother of a son twenty-three years of age, came assiduously to play cards with Madame Grandet, hoping to marry her dear Adolphe to Mademoiselle Eugenie.Monsieur des Grassins, the banker, vigorously promoted the schemes of his wife by means of secret services constantly rendered to the old miser, and always arrived in time upon the field of battle.The three des Grassins likewise had their adherents, their cousins, their faithful allies.On the Cruchot side the abbe, the Talleyrand of the family, well backed-up by his brother the notary, sharply contested every inch of ground with his female adversary, and tried to obtain the rich heiress for his nephew the president."
"这场克吕绍家和德格拉桑家之间的暗战，目的就是争取与欧仁妮·葛朗台联姻，这引起了索米尔社会各界人士的一片热议。葛朗台小姐会嫁给庭长先生呢，还是阿道夫·德格拉桑先生？对于这个问题，有些人的回答是，葛朗台先生决不会把女儿嫁给他们当中的任何一位。据他们说，这个老箍桶匠野心勃勃，正想攀附一个法国贵族，三十万法郎的收入会让他不计较葛朗台家所有过去、现在和将来的那些酒桶。另一些人回答说，德格拉桑先生和太太是贵族，而且特别有钱，阿道夫又一表人才，除非那个老头身边有教皇的侄子俯首帖耳，不然，这样一门合适的联姻应该能让一个出身寒微的人感到满意的，索米尔人都记得这个人曾手握扁斧，而且还戴过“红帽子”。某些精明人提醒大家注意一个事实，克吕绍·德蓬丰先生有权随时进入葛家，而他的对手只在星期天才会被接待。不过，还有些人坚持说，德格拉桑太太和葛朗台家里的女眷关系比克吕绍家更为亲密，能够往她们脑子里灌输些想法，迟早会促成好事的。对这个说法，前一派人反驳道，克吕绍神父是世上最会阿谀奉承的人：让一个女人和一个教士斗，争斗会不分上下。“这是棋逢对手。”索米尔的一个才子说道。","This secret warfare between the Cruchots and des Grassins, the prize thereof being the hand in marriage of Eugenie Grandet, kept the various social circles of Saumur in violent agitation.Would Mademoiselle Grandet marry Monsieur le president or Monsieur Adolphe des Grassins?To this problem some replied that Monsieur Grandet would never give his daughter to the one or to the other.The old cooper, eaten up with ambition, was looking, they said, for a peer of France, to whom an income of three hundred thousand francs would make all the past, present, and future casks of the Grandets acceptable.Others replied that Monsieur and Madame des Grassins were nobles, and exceedingly rich; that Adolphe was a personable young fellow; and that unless the old man had a nephew of the pope at his beck and call, such a suitable alliance ought to satisfy a man who came from nothing,—a man whom Saumur remembered with an adze in his hand, and who had, moreover, worn the @bonnet rouge@.Certain wise heads called attention to the fact that Monsieur Cruchot de Bonfons had the right of entry to the house at all times, whereas his rival was received only on Sundays.Others, however, maintained that Madame des Grassins was more intimate with the women of the house of Grandet than the Cruchots were, and could put into their minds certain ideas which would lead, sooner or later, to success.To this the former retorted that the Abbe Cruchot was the most insinuating man in the world: pit a woman against a monk, and the struggle was even.“It is diamond cut diamond,” said a Saumur wit."
"那些年长的居民比他们的乡邻更有智谋，宣称葛朗台一家精明过人，不会让财产落到外人手中的，索米尔的欧仁妮·葛朗台小姐会嫁给巴黎的葛朗台先生的儿子，这位葛朗台先生是个富有的葡萄酒批发商。对此，克吕绍派和格拉桑派回应道：","The oldest inhabitants, wiser than their fellows, declared that the Grandets knew better than to let the property go out of the family, and that Mademoiselle Eugenie Grandet of Saumur would be married to the son of Monsieur Grandet of Paris, a wealthy wholesale wine-merchant.To this the Cruchotines and the Grassinists replied:"
"“首先，那两兄弟三十年里仅见过两次；其次，巴黎的葛朗台先生对自己的儿子有雄心勃勃的规划。”"," “In the first place, the two brothers have seen each other only twice in thirty years; and next, Monsieur Grandet of Paris has ambitious designs for his son.”"
"他是一个郡的郡长、议员、国民近卫团的上校、商业法庭的法官，根本不承认和索米尔的葛朗台家有什么关系，他打算和某个公爵家联姻——受拿破仑恩宠的公爵。”　简而言之，方圆五十英里，甚至从昂热到布卢瓦的公共驿车上，到处都在议论这个女继承人！","He is mayor of an arrondissement, a deputy, colonel of the National Guard, judge in the commercial courts; he disowns the Grandets of Saumur, and means to ally himself with some ducal family,—ducal under favor of Napoleon.”In short, was there anything not said of an heiress who was talked of through a circumference of fifty miles, and even in the public conveyances from Angers to Blois, inclusively!"
"一八一一年初，克吕绍家在与格拉桑家的暗战中明显占了上风。弗罗瓦丰田庄因其庭园、别墅、农场、小溪、池塘、森林而出名，价值约三百万，年轻的弗罗瓦丰侯爵因不得不清理资产而要将其出售。克吕绍公证人、庭长和神父在他们的追随者的协助下，成功地阻止了将田庄分块出售的行为。公证人劝那个年轻人说，在得到每块地卖来的钱款之前，将不得不和分片地的购买者进行数不清的诉讼官司，因而，不如把整个田庄卖给葛朗台先生，他有偿付能力，而且能用现金来支付。这样公证人和那个年轻人就达成了整笔财产的交易，并以金子支付。弗罗瓦丰侯爵的良田就这样被送到了葛朗台先生的咽喉下，让索米尔人惊诧不已的是，他竟在履行了正常的手续后，适当地打了些折扣，就结清了钱。","At the beginning of 1811, the Cruchotines won a signal advantage over the Grassinists.The estate of Froidfond, remarkable for its park, its mansion, its farms, streams, ponds, forests, and worth about three millions, was put up for sale by the young Marquis de Froidfond, who was obliged to liquidate his possessions.Maitre Cruchot, the president, and the abbe, aided by their adherents, were able to prevent the sale of the estate in little lots.The notary concluded a bargain with the young man for the whole property, payable in gold, persuading him that suits without number would have to be brought against the purchasers of small lots before he could get the money for them; it was better, therefore, to sell the whole to Monsieur Grandet, who was solvent and able to pay for the estate in ready money.The fine marquisate of Froidfond was accordingly conveyed down the gullet of Monsieur Grandet, who, to the great astonishment of Saumur, paid for it, under proper discount, with the usual formalities."
"这件事从南特一直传到了奥尔良。葛朗台先生搭了马车返程，经由弗罗瓦丰去看了他自己的庄园。以主人的身份看了整个产业之后，他回到了索米尔，他对这次投资可赢利百分之五感到很满意，于是便有了一个惊人的想法，就是将他全部的田产都集中起来，以扩大和增加弗罗瓦丰封地。接着，为填满现在几近空虚的金库，他决心砍掉他的林木和森林，再把草场上的杨树都卖掉。","This affair echoed from Nantes to Orleans.Monsieur Grandet took advantage of a cart returning by way of Froidfond to go and see his chateau.Having cast a master’s eye over the whole property, he returned to Saumur, satisfied that he had invested his money at five per cent, and seized by the stupendous thought of extending and increasing the marquisate of Froidfond by concentrating all his property there.Then, to fill up his coffers, now nearly empty, he resolved to thin out his woods and his forests, and to sell off the poplars in the meadows."
"第二章","Chapter II "
"现在就容易理解“葛朗台先生的府邸”这个词的全部含义了——那座寒冷、寂静、了无生机的宅子坐落在城市的高处，被城墙的废墟所遮掩。门洞的门敞开着，组成门洞的两个门柱和拱顶跟这所房子本身一样，是用石灰石砌成的——一种卢瓦尔河畔特有的白石，极其柔软，用不到二百多年就不行了。由于天气的险恶，门拱和入口侧墙被雕凿或者说侵蚀出无数奇形怪状、不规则的洞眼，使得门拱和入口侧墙的样子仿佛法国建筑的虫迹式石雕，有一点儿像监狱的大门。在门拱的上面是一个长形浅浮雕，用硬石刻成，描绘的是四季风景，表面已经剥落并发黑。这个浅浮雕顶上有一个凸起的底座，上面长出来各种各样的花草树木——有黄色的小白菊、牵牛花、旋花、荨麻、车前草，甚至还有一株小樱桃树，已经长得相当高了。","It is now easy to understand the full meaning of the term, “the house of Monsieur Grandet,”—that cold, silent, pallid dwelling, standing above the town and sheltered by the ruins of the ramparts.The two pillars and the arch, which made the porte-cochere on which the door opened, were built, like the house itself, of tufa,—a white stone peculiar to the shores of the Loire, and so soft that it lasts hardly more than two centuries.Numberless irregular holes, capriciously bored or eaten out by the inclemency of the weather, gave an appearance of the vermiculated stonework of French architecture to the arch and the side walls of this entrance, which bore some resemblance to the gateway of a jail.Above the arch was a long bas-relief, in hard stone, representing the four seasons, the faces already crumbling away and blackened.This bas-relief was surmounted by a projecting plinth, upon which a variety of chance growths had sprung up,—yellow pellitory, bindweed, convolvuli, nettles, plantain, and even a little cherry-tree, already grown to some height."
"拱道的门是用整块橡木板做成的，呈棕色，已干枯，许多地方都有了裂纹。尽管表面不大结实，却是被一组对称排列的铁螺栓牢牢地固定住了。一个小的方形花栅正居中央的方洞，上面的铁条排得很密，因生锈而成了红色。可以说，它为门槌的出现提供了一个理由，门槌由一个环吊在上面，正好敲在一颗裂开嘴的大钉子的头上。门槌是长椭圆形，样子很像我们祖先所称的那种能击钟报时的金属人像，看上去像一个巨大的感叹号，仔细检查过它的古董商可能会发现有人像的痕迹，当初基本上表现的是个滑稽小丑的样子，长期的使用现在已将其磨平。通过这个小花栅——过去在内战时期是用作辨认访客的——好奇者可以看到，在阴暗而黏滑的拱顶尽头，有几级破碎的台阶通向一座花园，那花园用墙围了起来，围墙又厚又潮湿，上面渗着水，滋养了一簇簇娇弱的小草，倒是别有情致。这些围墙是原城墙的废墟，下面排列着邻近几家的花园。","The door of the archway was made of solid oak, brown, shrunken, and split in many places; though frail in appearance, it was firmly held in place by a system of iron bolts arranged in symmetrical patterns.A small square grating, with close bars red with rust, filled up the middle panel and made, as it were, a motive for the knocker, fastened to it by a ring, which struck upon the grinning head of a huge nail.This knocker, of the oblong shape and kind which our ancestors called @jaquemart@, looked like a huge note of exclamation; an antiquary who examined it attentively might have found indications of the figure, essentially burlesque, which it once represented, and which long usage had now effaced.Through this little grating—intended in olden times for the recognition of friends in times of civil war—inquisitive persons could perceive, at the farther end of the dark and slimy vault, a few broken steps which led to a garden, picturesquely shut in by walls that were thick and damp, and through which oozed a moisture that nourished tufts of sickly herbage.These walls were the ruins of the ramparts, under which ranged the gardens of several neighboring houses."
"宅子底层最重要的房间是一个大厅，从大门的拱顶下可以直接进去。在安茹、图赖讷和贝里这样的小城镇，很少有人知道大厅的重要性。大厅可同时兼作前厅、客厅、办公室、内室和餐厅，是家庭生活的重要场所，是公用的起居室。在这里，本区的理发师一年两次来给葛朗台先生理发；农民、堂区神父、副县长，还有磨房伙计有事也是来这里。这间屋子整个都是木制的，有两个朝街的窗户。镶着老式装饰线的灰色护墙板从上到下铺满了墙壁，天花板露出了所有的横梁，横梁同样也被漆成了灰色，而中间的空隙被涂成了白色，现在因年久已发了黄。一座黄铜老钟，镶嵌着阿拉伯式花饰，摆在壁炉台上，壁炉台是白石做的，刻工粗糙。在壁炉台上方是一面泛绿的镜子，边缘被切成斜面，显出了玻璃的厚度，波形花纹装饰的钢制哥特式镜框四周都在反着光。两盏大枝形的镀金黄铜烛台装饰在壁炉台的角上，这两盏烛台有双重的作用：拿掉旁边的托枝，每个托枝都有一个托座，主干——被固定在一个淡蓝色大理石的基座上，顶端镶着铜边——就成了一个能放一支蜡烛的蜡烛架，可供日常使用。　椅子是古式的样子，上面盖着表现喷泉寓言的绒绣织品，不过，要猜出其内容，那一定要非常了解那位作者才行，因为颜色已经褪尽，而且过多的织补使人物形象也变得模糊难认。","The most important room on the ground-floor of the house was a large hall, entered directly from beneath the vault of the porte-cochere.Few people know the importance of a hall in the little towns of Anjou, Touraine, and Berry.The hall is at one and the same time antechamber, salon, office, boudoir, and dining-room; it is the theatre of domestic life, the common living-room.There the barber of the neighborhood came, twice a year, to cut Monsieur Grandet’s hair; there the farmers, the cure, the under-prefect, and the miller’s boy came on business.This room, with two windows looking on the street, was entirely of wood.Gray panels with ancient mouldings covered the walls from top to bottom; the ceiling showed all its beams, which were likewise painted gray, while the space between them had been washed over in white, now yellow with age.An old brass clock, inlaid with arabesques, adorned the mantel of the ill-cut white stone chimney-piece, above which was a greenish mirror, whose edges, bevelled to show the thickness of the glass, reflected a thread of light the whole length of a gothic frame in damascened steel-work.The two copper-gilt candelabra which decorated the corners of the chimney-piece served a double purpose: by taking off the side-branches, each of which held a socket, the main stem—which was fastened to a pedestal of bluish marble tipped with copper—made a candlestick for one candle, which was sufficient for ordinary occasions.The chairs, antique in shape, were covered with tapestry representing the fables of La Fontaine; it was necessary, however, to know that writer well to guess at the subjects, for the faded colors and the figures, blurred by much darning, were difficult to distinguish."
"大厅的四角放着橱柜，确切点说是碗橱，上面盖着肮脏的搁板。一张镶嵌细木的旧牌桌，桌面是个棋盘，搁在两个窗户之间的空地上。在这个桌子上方有一个椭圆形的晴雨表，黑框上饰有金边花纹，使得黑框光彩照人，但苍蝇在上面肆意妄为，使金边变得污浊不堪。在壁炉台对面的墙板上是两幅粉蜡笔肖像，大概画的是葛朗台太太的祖父——老德拉贝尔特利耶先生，法国近卫团中尉，还有已故的让蒂耶夫人，着一身牧羊女的装束。窗户上挂着图尔产的红色横绫绸窗帘，用丝带收了起来，丝带上系有教堂惯用的流苏。这种奢华的装饰与葛朗台先生的习惯极不协调，其实这些东西连同钢制穿衣镜、绒绣织品和红木碗橱，都是买房子时就有的。","At the four corners of the hall were closets, or rather buffets, surmounted by dirty shelves.An old card-table in marquetry, of which the upper part was a chess-board, stood in the space between the two windows.Above this table was an oval barometer with a black border enlivened with gilt bands, on which the flies had so licentiously disported themselves that the gilding had become problematical.On the panel opposite to the chimney-piece were two portraits in pastel, supposed to represent the grandfather of Madame Grandet, old Monsieur de la Bertelliere, as a lieutenant in the French guard, and the deceased Madame Gentillet in the guise of a shepherdess.The windows were draped with curtains of red @gros de Tours@ held back by silken cords with ecclesiastical tassels.This luxurious decoration, little in keeping with the habits of Monsieur Grandet, had been, together with the steel pier-glass, the tapestries, and the buffets, which were of rose-wood, included in the purchase of the house."
"离门最近的窗户边上有一把草编椅，椅子腿上装有小脚轮，垫高了坐椅子的人——葛朗台太太，其高度正好可以让她看见行人。一张染了色的樱桃木针线桌把整个窗洞都塞满了，旁边是欧仁妮·葛朗台的小扶手椅。这个地方的生活在每年四月到十一月一轮又一轮不停的劳作中平静地度过了十五年。十一月的第一天，她们挪到壁炉边过冬。只有到了这一天，葛朗台才允许生火，到了三月三十一号要灭火，不管早春的春寒料峭，也不管深秋的寒意袭人。大个子娜农想方设法为葛朗台太太和小姐保留下厨房的炭火余烬，填进了一只脚炉，使她们得以熬过四月和十月那些寒冷的早晨和夜晚。母女二人负责全家的衣服被褥，整日勤勤恳恳，像女工一样地操劳，以致欧仁妮要想为母亲绣一下衣领，都不得不挤出睡觉的时间，还得编谎骗父亲以得到必要的烛火。长期以来，这个老吝啬鬼像每天早上分发每日所需的面包和其他必需品一样，把油蜡烛分发给女儿和大个子娜农。","By the window nearest to the door stood a straw chair, whose legs were raised on castors to lift its occupant, Madame Grandet, to a height from which she could see the passers-by.A work-table of stained cherry-wood filled up the embrasure, and the little armchair of Eugenie Grandet stood beside it.In this spot the lives had flowed peacefully onward for fifteen years, in a round of constant work from the month of April to the month of November.On the first day of the latter month they took their winter station by the chimney.Not until that day did Grandet permit a fire to be lighted; and on the thirty-first of March it was extinguished, without regard either to the chills of the early spring or to those of a wintry autumn.A foot-warmer, filled with embers from the kitchen fire, which la Grande Nanon contrived to save for them, enabled Madame and Mademoiselle Grandet to bear the chilly mornings and evenings of April and October.Mother and daughter took charge of the family linen, and spent their days so conscientiously upon a labor properly that of working-women, that if Eugenie wished to embroider a collar for her mother she was forced to take the time from sleep, and deceive her father to obtain the necessary light.For a long time the miser had given out the tallow candle to his daughter and la Grande Nanon just as he gave out every morning the bread and other necessaries for the daily consumption."
"大个子娜农也许是唯一一个能够心甘情愿忍受她主子的专制作风的人。全城人都羡慕葛朗台先生和太太能有她这样一个佣人。大个子娜农因身高而得名，她身高五英尺八英寸，已经和葛朗台先生一起生活了三十五年。尽管她每年只拿六十法郎的工钱，却被公认是索米尔最有钱的女佣之一。那六十法郎整整攒了三十五年，最近她终于可以在克吕绍公证人那里存下四千法郎的终身年金。她长年坚持节省，似乎还真攒了一笔巨款。城里的每个佣人看到这位六十多岁的可怜人晚年生活有了保障，都嫉妒她，却从没想过这是她当牛做马换来的。","La Grande Nanon was perhaps the only human being capable of accepting willingly the despotism of her master.The whole town envied Monsieur and Madame Grandet the possession of her.La Grande Nanon, so called on account of her height, which was five feet eight inches, had lived with Monsieur Grandet for thirty-five years.Though she received only sixty francs a year in wages, she was supposed to be one of the richest serving-women in Saumur.Those sixty francs, accumulating through thirty-five years, had recently enabled her to invest four thousand francs in an annuity with Maitre Cruchot.This result of her long and persistent economy seemed gigantic.Every servant in the town, seeing that the poor sexagenarian was sure of bread for her old age, was jealous of her, and never thought of the hard slavery through which it had been won."
"二十二岁那年，这可怜的姑娘找不到落脚处，因为她的脸几乎令所有人生厌。但是，这种感觉当然是不公正的：这张脸要是长在近卫团士兵的肩膀上就会得到赞赏的，可是正如他们所说，什么事情都得般配才行。她给一家农场养牛，因为农户的房子被烧毁了，她就被迫离开了。凭着什么活都敢做的果敢勇气，她来到索米尔找活干。葛朗台老头当时正要结婚，准备成家。他注意到了这个姑娘，尽管她被家家户户都拒之门外。作为箍桶匠，他是判断体力的好手，他估计身形如赫尔克里士的女人可能很能干活，她站得稳稳的，像棵根深蒂固的六十年的橡树，臀部结实，后背宽阔，有一双车夫般的手，而且还诚实，跟她守身如玉的贞洁一样可靠。不管是布满大个子娜农那武夫般的脸上的疣子，还是她皮肤的红砖色，还是那肌肉发达的胳膊，抑或是她破烂的衣服，都没有让箍桶匠退缩，尽管他那时还在春心欲动的年纪。他给那可怜的姑娘提供饭菜、鞋子和衣物，给她工钱，而且使唤她时也不过分粗暴。看见自己有这样的待遇，大个子娜农高兴得偷偷哭了，于是便对主人忠心耿耿，从那天起，他就像封建主那样指挥她、使唤她。娜农什么活都干。她做饭，做碱液，到卢瓦尔河洗衣服，再用肩膀扛回家；她早早起床，很晚才睡觉；在收获季节，她为葡萄整枝工做饭，监督市场上的人，像一只忠诚的狗一样保护她主人的财产，对主人甚至可以说是完全盲目的信任，一声不吭地服从他最荒唐的强行压榨。","At twenty-two years of age the poor girl had been unable to find a situation, so repulsive was her face to almost every one.Yet the feeling was certainly unjust: the face would have been much admired on the shoulders of a grenadier of the guard; but all things, so they say, should be in keeping.Forced to leave a farm where she kept the cows, because the dwelling-house was burned down, she came to Saumur to find a place, full of the robust courage that shrinks from no labor.Le Pere Grandet was at that time thinking of marriage and about to set up his household.He espied the girl, rejected as she was from door to door.A good judge of corporeal strength in his trade as a cooper, he guessed the work that might be got out of a female creature shaped like a Hercules, as firm on her feet as an oak sixty years old on its roots, strong in the hips, square in the back, with the hands of a cartman and an honesty as sound as her unblemished virtue.Neither the warts which adorned her martial visage, nor the red-brick tints of her skin, nor the sinewy arms, nor the ragged garments of la Grande Nanon, dismayed the cooper, who was at that time still of an age when the heart shudders.He fed, shod, and clothed the poor girl, gave her wages, and put her to work without treating her too roughly.Seeing herself thus welcomed, la Grande Nanon wept secretly tears of joy, and attached herself in all sincerity to her master, who from that day ruled her and worked her with feudal authority.Nanon did everything.She cooked, she made the lye, she washed the linen in the Loire and brought it home on her shoulders; she got up early, she went to bed late; she prepared the food of the vine-dressers during the harvest, kept watch upon the market-people, protected the property of her master like a faithful dog, and even, full of blind confidence, obeyed without a murmur his most absurd exactions."
"在著名的一八一一年，当时收葡萄的活干得空前艰苦，葛朗台决心把他的旧手表送给娜农——这是她当牛做马二十年来第一次收到他送的礼物。尽管他也给她送他的旧鞋（那些鞋合她的脚），但是这种季度性的恩惠不能算作礼物，因为那总是些彻底烂掉的鞋子。穷困已使这个可怜的姑娘变得非常吝啬，以至于葛朗台渐渐喜欢上了她，就像我们喜欢狗一样，而娜农也让他往自己的脖子上系上了带刺的颈圈，上面的刺也扎不疼她了。如果葛朗台把面包切得过于节省，她也不会抱怨；她愉快地分享着这家人严格的饮食起居制度所带来的保健卫生上的好处，家里从来没人生病。实际上，娜农就是这个家庭的一员；当葛朗台笑的时候，她也笑；当葛朗台发愁、挨冻、取暖、苦干的时候，她也一样发愁、挨冻、取暖、苦干。在这样的平等之中有着多么令人愉快的补偿呀！主人从来没有因为她偷些葡萄或者在树下吃李子和蜜桃去责怪这个佣人。“来，吃吧，娜农！”多年来，当果实把树枝压弯而佃户们不得不拿去喂猪的时候，他会说道。","In the famous year of 1811, when the grapes were gathered with unheard-of difficulty, Grandet resolved to give Nanon his old watch,—the first present he had made her during twenty years of service.Though he turned over to her his old shoes (which fitted her), it is impossible to consider that quarterly benefit as a gift, for the shoes were always thoroughly worn-out.Necessity had made the poor girl so niggardly that Grandet had grown to love her as we love a dog, and Nanon had let him fasten a spiked collar round her throat, whose spikes no longer pricked her.If Grandet cut the bread with rather too much parsimony, she made no complaint; she gaily shared the hygienic benefits derived from the severe regime of the household, in which no one was ever ill.Nanon was, in fact, one of the family; she laughed when Grandet laughed, felt gloomy or chilly, warmed herself, and toiled as he did.What pleasant compensations there were in such equality!Never did the master have occasion to find fault with the servant for pilfering the grapes, nor for the plums and nectarines eaten under the trees.“Come, fall-to, Nanon!” he would say in years when the branches bent under the fruit and the farmers were obliged to give it to the pigs."
"对于这个从小饱受虐待的穷苦农民、被人出于善心而收留的穷女孩子来说，葛朗台模棱两可的一笑简直就像一缕阳光。此外，娜农纯朴的内心和简单的头脑只能装得下一种感情和一个想法。三十五年来，她一如既往地站在葛朗台先生林场的前面，衣衫褴褛，赤着脚，听他说道：","To the poor peasant who in her youth had earned nothing but harsh treatment, to the pauper girl picked up by charity, Grandet’s ambiguous laugh was like a sunbeam.Moreover, Nanon’s simple heart and narrow head could hold only one feeling and one idea.For thirty-five years she had never ceased to see herself standing before the wood-yard of Monsieur Grandet, ragged and barefooted, and to hear him say:"
"“你想要什么，孩子？”"," “What do you want, young one?”"
"她总是感激不尽。有时，葛朗台想到这个可怜人还从没听到过一句奉承话，对女人所激发起的所有温情也一无所知，将来某一天出现在上帝的宝座前可能比圣母玛利亚还要纯洁时——葛朗台动了恻隐之心，会看着她，说道，“可怜的娜农！”　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　这句感叹之后，那个老佣人总是用难以形容的目光看他一下。这些词语不时地蹦出来，形成了一条无论什么也割不断的友谊之链，每一句感叹都会往这链子上多加上一个环。这种发自守财奴内心的怜悯令这个老姑娘心存感激，其中竟也有些不可思议、令人发怵的成分。事实上，这种残酷的怜悯唤起了老箍桶匠心里的千般欢乐，而对于娜农来说，那就是全部的幸福。“可怜的娜农！”同样的话谁不会说呢？从他们声音的变化和暗暗的叹息中，上帝会认出谁是他的天使。","Her gratitude was ever new.Sometimes Grandet, reflecting that the poor creature had never heard a flattering word, that she was ignorant of all the tender sentiments inspired by women, that she might some day appear before the throne of God even more chaste than the Virgin Mary herself,—Grandet, struck with pity, would say as he looked at her, “Poor Nanon!”The exclamation was always followed by an undefinable look cast upon him in return by the old servant.The words, uttered from time to time, formed a chain of friendship that nothing ever parted, and to which each exclamation added a link.Such compassion arising in the heart of the miser, and accepted gratefully by the old spinster, had something inconceivably horrible about it.This cruel pity, recalling, as it did, a thousand pleasures to the heart of the old cooper, was for Nanon the sum total of happiness.Who does not likewise say, “Poor Nanon!”God will recognize his angels by the inflexions of their voices and by their secret sighs."
"索米尔有很多人家的佣人得到的待遇要更好，但是主人却没有让下人感到那么满意。因而人们经常说：","There were very many households in Saumur where the servants were better treated, but where the masters received far less satisfaction in return.Thus it was often said:"
"“葛朗台家究竟做了什么，能让他们家的大个子娜农对他们这么忠心？为了他们，她简直会赴汤蹈火！”她的厨房窗户上装着铁栏杆，朝向院子，厨房里总是干净、整洁、冰冷——在一个真正的守财奴的厨房里，什么东西都不浪费。等娜农洗完碗碟，把剩下的晚饭锁起来，灭了火，她便离开厨房，到主人旁边纺麻，厨房与起居室中间隔着一个走廊。一支油蜡烛就足够全家人晚上用了。这个佣人睡在走廊尽头的一个小房子里，仅有天窗透进来的一点亮光。她强壮健康的体格使她能够住在这个洞里而安然无恙。这沉闷的宅子白天黑夜都一片沉寂，在这间小屋里，哪怕是最细微的声响，她都能听得见。她竖着一只耳朵睡觉，像个看门狗一样，休息时也保持着警惕。　　　　　　　　　　　　　"," “What have the Grandets ever done to make their Grande Nanon so attached to them?She would go through fire and water for their sake!”Her kitchen, whose barred windows looked into the court, was always clean, neat, cold,—a true miser’s kitchen, where nothing went to waste.When Nanon had washed her dishes, locked up the remains of the dinner, and put out her fire, she left the kitchen, which was separated by a passage from the living-room, and went to spin hemp beside her masters.One tallow candle sufficed the family for the evening.The servant slept at the end of the passage in a species of closet lighted only by a fan-light.Her robust health enabled her to live in this hole with impunity; there she could hear the slightest noise through the deep silence which reigned night and day in that dreary house.Like a watch-dog, she slept with one ear open, and took her rest with a mind alert."
"房子的其余部分将会随着这段历史事件的发展而逐一加以描述，尽管前面对家里所有奢侈品出现的场所——大厅的概述，可能会让读者推测出楼上也是很寒酸的。","A description of the other parts of the dwelling will be found connected with the events of this history, though the foregoing sketch of the hall, where the whole luxury of the household appears, may enable the reader to surmise the nakedness of the upper floors."
"一八一九年十一月中旬的一个傍晚，大个子娜农第一次生火。那个秋天天气很好。这一天是克吕绍家和格拉桑家都很熟悉的一个节日。六位对手全副武装，正准备到葛朗台家会面，比比谁在证明友情方面能胜过对方。那天早上，全索米尔的人都看到葛朗台太太和小姐由娜农陪伴着，走在去教区教堂望弥撒的路上，而且每个人都记得那天是欧仁妮小姐的生日。算准了晚饭结束的时间，克吕绍公证人、克吕绍神父和克·德蓬丰先生匆匆忙忙抢在德格拉桑家之前赶到，并第一个向欧仁妮小姐道贺。三个人带来了几大束花，那是从他们的小温室里采来的。庭长打算献的那束花的花茎被精心裹上了一条装饰着金流苏的白色缎带。早上，葛朗台先生按照往常庆祝欧仁妮生日和命名日的习惯，来到她的床边，郑重其事地把他作为父亲的礼物送给了她——过去十三年来始终如一总是一枚稀罕的金币。葛朗台太太视情况而定，不是送女儿一条冬天穿的裙子就是一条夏天穿的裙子。这两件裙子和那些金币，包括元旦和父亲的生日时她得到的另外两枚，让欧仁妮有了大约一百克朗的一小笔收入，葛朗台喜欢看她把钱都攒着。这不就是把他的钱从一个保险箱放到另一个保险箱吗？可以说，不就是培养他的继承人如何吝啬吗？他有时会盘问她的财产数目（过去攒的是贝尔特利耶夫妇的礼物），说：","In 1819, at the beginning of an evening in the middle of November, la Grande Nanon lighted the fire for the first time.The autumn had been very fine.This particular day was a fete-day well known to the Cruchotines and the Grassinists.The six antagonists, armed at all points, were making ready to meet at the Grandets and surpass each other in testimonials of friendship.That morning all Saumur had seen Madame and Mademoiselle Grandet, accompanied by Nanon, on their way to hear Mass at the parish church, and every one remembered that the day was the anniversary of Mademoiselle Eugenie’s birth.Calculating the hour at which the family dinner would be over, Maitre Cruchot, the Abbe Cruchot, and Monsieur C. de Bonfons hastened to arrive before the des Grassins, and be the first to pay their compliments to Mademoiselle Eugenie.All three brought enormous bouquets, gathered in their little green-houses.The stalks of the flowers which the president intended to present were ingeniously wound round with a white satin ribbon adorned with gold fringe.In the morning Monsieur Grandet, following his usual custom on the days that commemorated the birth and the fete of Eugenie, went to her bedside and solemnly presented her with his paternal gift,—which for the last thirteen years had consisted regularly of a curious gold-piece.Madame Grandet gave her daughter a winter dress or a summer dress, as the case might be.These two dresses and the gold-pieces, of which she received two others on New Year’s day and on her father’s fete-day, gave Eugenie a little revenue of a hundred crowns or thereabouts, which Grandet loved to see her amass.Was it not putting his money from one strong-box to another, and, as it were, training the parsimony of his heiress?From whom he sometimes demanded an account of her treasure (formerly increased by the gifts of the Bertellieres), saying: "
"“那将是你结婚的压箱钱。”","“It is to be your marriage dozen.”"
"“压箱钱”是一种古老的风俗，在法国中部的许多地方被奉若神明般地保留了下来，并依然盛行。在贝里和安茹，当一个年轻姑娘出嫁时，她娘家或是丈夫家一定会给她一个钱袋，依家境而定，他们会在里面装上十二枚，或一百四十四枚，或一千二百枚金币。最穷的牧羊女要没有压箱钱，也是不会结婚的，哪怕是十二个铜钱也行。在伊苏丹，他们仍在谈论某个富家女获赠的“压箱钱”竟有一百四十四枚葡萄牙金币。教皇克莱芒七世，即卡特琳·德梅迪契的叔叔，在把卡特琳嫁给亨利二世时，送给她十二枚价值连城的古代金勋章。","The “marriage dozen” is an old custom sacredly preserved and still in force in many parts of central France.In Berry and in Anjou, when a young girl marries, her family, or that of the husband, must give her a purse, in which they place, according to their means, twelve pieces, or twelve dozen pieces, or twelve hundred pieces of gold.The poorest shepherd-girl never marries without her dozen, be it only a dozen coppers.They still tell in Issoudun of a certain “dozen” presented to a rich heiress, which contained a hundred and forty-four @portugaises d’or@.Pope Clement VII., uncle of Catherine de’ Medici, gave her when he married her to Henri II. a dozen antique gold medals of priceless value."
"吃晚饭时，父亲看见欧仁妮穿着新礼服光彩照人的样子非常高兴，大声说道：","During dinner the father, delighted to see his Eugenie looking well in a new gown, exclaimed: "
"“既然今天是欧仁妮的生日，咱们生上火吧，这会是个好兆头的。”","“As it is Eugenie’s birthday let us have a fire; it will be a good omen.”"
"“小姐今年要结婚了，肯定没错的。”大个子娜农一边说着，一边拿走吃剩下的鹅肉——那是手艺人家的珍禽。","“Mademoiselle will be married this year, that’s certain,” said la Grande Nanon, carrying away the remains of the goose,—the pheasant of tradesmen."
"“我看在索米尔就没有适合她的人。”葛朗台太太一边说，一边怯生生地瞥着丈夫，以她的年纪而言，她这个样子说明了这个可怜的女人在遭受着丈夫的奴役。","“I don’t see any one suitable for her in Saumur,” said Madame Grandet, glancing at her husband with a timid look which, considering her years, revealed the conjugal slavery under which the poor woman languished."
"葛朗台看着自己的女儿，快活地大声叫道——","Grandet looked at his daughter and exclaimed gaily,—"
"“这孩子今天二十三岁了，我们很快得开始操心这件事了。”","“She is twenty-three years old today, the child; we must soon begin to think of it.”"
"欧仁妮和她母亲默不作声，彼此会意地看了对方一眼。","Eugenie and her mother silently exchanged a glance of intelligence."
"葛朗台太太是个又干又瘦的女人，像榅桲一样黄，笨手笨脚，动作迟缓，属于那种生来就受人欺压的女人。她骨骼粗大，鼻子大，脑门大，眼睛大，乍一看有点像那种既没有味道也没有水分的干果子。她的牙齿发黑，所剩无几，她的嘴巴布满皱纹，下巴又长又尖。她是个好女人，一个真正的拉贝尔特利耶家的人。克吕绍神父找机会告诉她，说她当年长得并不难看，她竟信了他的话。她像天使一样温柔，像被孩子折磨的昆虫一样逆来顺受，很少有像她那么虔诚的，她心肠又好，心境始终平和，因此赢得了人们的同情与尊重。她丈夫给她的个人花销，一次从不超过六法郎。尽管外貌似乎有些可笑，这个女人的嫁妆和各种各样继承的遗产给葛朗台老头带来了三十多万法郎，她却总是因寄人篱下和受人奴役而倍感羞辱，她温柔的天性使得她从不做任何反抗。她从不要一个子儿，对克吕绍公证人让她签字的文件，从没有任何异议。","Madame Grandet was a dry, thin woman, as yellow as a quince, awkward, slow, one of those women who are born to be down-trodden.She had big bones, a big nose, a big forehead, big eyes, and presented at first sight a vague resemblance to those mealy fruits that have neither savor nor succulence.Her teeth were black and few in number, her mouth was wrinkled, her chin long and pointed.She was an excellent woman, a true la Bertelliere.L’abbe Cruchot found occasional opportunity to tell her that she had not done ill; and she believed him.Angelic sweetness, the resignation of an insect tortured by children, a rare piety, a good heart, an unalterable equanimity of soul, made her universally pitied and respected.Her husband never gave her more than six francs at a time for her personal expenses.Ridiculous as it may seem, this woman, who by her own fortune and her various inheritances brought Pere Grandet more than three hundred thousand francs, had always felt so profoundly humiliated by her dependence and the slavery in which she lived, against which the gentleness of her spirit prevented her from revolting, that she had never asked for one penny or made a single remark on the deeds which Maitre Cruchot brought for her signature."
"藏在心底的这种愚蠢的自尊，永远被葛朗台误解和伤害的这种高尚的胸怀，支配着这位妻子的一举一动。","This foolish secret pride, this nobility of soul perpetually misunderstood and wounded by Grandet, ruled the whole conduct of the wife."
"葛朗台太太经常穿一条淡绿色利凡廷里子绸的长裙，总是尽力让这件衣服能穿差不多一年。除此之外，她还戴一条白棉布大头巾，一顶草编女帽，几乎总是系条黑丝围裙。由于她很少出门，所以不怎么费鞋。她从没为自己要过什么。当葛朗台想起来从上次给她六法郎已过了很久时，他偶尔会感到自责，便总在每年出售当年收成时，对“妻子的零花钱”作下约定。购买葡萄酒的比利时人或是荷兰人所赠送的四、五个金路易，就是葛朗台太太年收入的主要可见进项。然而当她收下那五个金路易以后，她丈夫就经常对她说——好像他们的钱包是公用的：“你能借给我几个苏吗？”那可怜的女人很高兴能为这个男人做点什么，一个冬天就会从“零用钱”里拿出几个克朗还给他，因为她的告解神甫曾告诉她，丈夫是她的老爷和主人。","Madame Grandet was attired habitually in a gown of greenish levantine silk, endeavoring to make it last nearly a year; with it she wore a large kerchief of white cotton cloth, a bonnet made of plaited straws sewn together, and almost always a black-silk apron.As she seldom left the house she wore out very few shoes.She never asked anything for herself.Grandet, seized with occasional remorse when he remembered how long a time had elapsed since he gave her the last six francs, always stipulated for the “wife’s pin-money” when he sold his yearly vintage.The four or five louis presented by the Belgian or the Dutchman who purchased the wine were the chief visible signs of Madame Grandet’s annual revenues.But after she had received the five louis, her husband would often say to her, as though their purse were held in common: “Can you lend me a few sous?” and the poor woman, glad to be able to do something for a man whom her confessor held up to her as her lord and master, returned him in the course of the winter several crowns out of the “pin-money.”"
"当葛朗台从自己口袋掏出五法郎的硬币时，那是给他女儿用作每月最低开支的，用来买线、针、梳妆品，他会一边系着马裤口袋的扣子，一边总不忘说道：","When Grandet drew from his pocket the five-franc piece which he allowed monthly for the minor expenses,—thread, needles, and toilet,—of his daughter, he never failed to say as he buttoned his breeches’ pocket: "
"“还有你，孩子她妈，你要点什么？”","“And you, mother, do you want anything?”"
"“我的老伴，”葛朗台太太出于当母亲的尊严，会回答道，“我们以后再说吧。”","“My friend,” Madame Grandet would answer, moved by a sense of maternal dignity, “we will see about that later.”"
"没用的尊严！葛朗台认为自己对妻子非常慷慨。哲学家们如若遇到娜农、葛朗台太太、欧仁妮这样的人，一定有理由认为嘲弄是上帝的本性。","Wasted dignity!Grandet thought himself very generous to his wife.Philosophers who meet the like of Nanon, of Madame Grandet, of Eugenie, have surely a right to say that irony is at the bottom of the ways of Providence."
"在初次提到欧仁妮婚事的那顿晚饭之后，娜农到葛朗台先生的卧室去拿一瓶黑藨子果仁甜酒，下楼梯时差点儿摔倒。","After the dinner at which for the first time allusion had been made to Eugenie’s marriage, Nanon went to fetch a bottle of black-currant ratafia from Monsieur Grandet’s bed-chamber, and nearly fell as she came down the stairs."
"“你这个大笨蛋！”她的主子说，“你也要和别人一样摔倒吗，啊？”","“You great stupid!” said her master, “are you going to tumble about like other people, hey?”"
"“先生，是您的楼梯台阶不结实了。”","“Monsieur, it was that step on your staircase which has given way.”"
"“她说得对，”葛朗台太太说，“楼梯早就应该修理了。昨天欧仁妮差点儿扭到脚踝。”","“She is right,” said Madame Grandet, “it ought to have been mended long ago.Yesterday Eugenie nearly twisted her ankle.”"
"“嘿，”葛朗台看见娜农的脸色十分苍白，对她说道，“既然是欧仁妮的生日，你又差点儿摔倒，喝一小杯果仁甜酒来压压惊吧。”","“Here,” said Grandet to Nanon, seeing that she looked quite pale, “as it is Eugenie’s birthday, and you came near falling, take a little glass of ratafia to set you right.”"
"“真的！我该喝的，”娜农说，“多数人会把瓶子摔碎的，可是我宁可摔断胳膊肘，也要把瓶子举得高高的。”","“Faith! I’ve earned it,” said Nanon, “most people would have broken the bottle; but I’d sooner have broken my elbow holding it up high.”"
"“可怜的娜农！”葛朗台说着，倒满了一杯酒。","“Poor Nanon!” said Grandet, filling a glass."
"“你伤着没？”欧仁妮问道，关切地看着她。","“Did you hurt yourself?” asked Eugenie, looking kindly at her."
"“没有，我没摔倒，我往后一挺站住了。”","“No, I didn’t fall; I threw myself back on my haunches.”"
"“好吧！既然是欧仁妮的生日，”葛朗台说，“我会修修台阶的。你们这些人就不懂得把脚放在木头结实的角上。”","“Well! As it is Eugenie’s birthday,” said Grandet, “I’ll have the step mended.You people don’t know how to set your foot in the corner where the wood is still firm.”"
"葛朗台拿来蜡烛，将他妻子、女儿和佣人留在了黑暗里，除了壁炉烧得正旺的火苗之外，别无其他光亮，他走进面包房取木板、钉子和工具。","Grandet took the candle, leaving his wife, daughter, and servant without any other light than that from the hearth, where the flames were lively, and went into the bakehouse to fetch planks, nails, and tools."
"“要帮忙吗？”娜农听到他敲打楼梯的声音便喊道。","“Can I help you?” cried Nanon, hearing him hammer on the stairs."
"“不，不用！我干这个是老手。”这位曾经的箍桶匠回答道。","“No, no! I’m an old hand at it,” answered the former cooper."
"葛朗台在修虫蛀的楼梯时，想起年轻时的往事，高声吹起了口哨，这时，三位克吕绍敲响了门。","At the moment when Grandet was mending his worm-eaten staircase and whistling with all his might, in remembrance of the days of his youth, the three Cruchots knocked at the door."
"“是您吗，克吕绍先生？”娜农从小花栅往外看看，然后问道。","“Is it you, Monsieur Cruchot?” asked Nanon, peeping through the little grating."
"“是的。”庭长回答。","“Yes,” answered the president."
"娜农开了门，壁炉的火光照到了天花板上，三位克吕绍这才看清了进屋的路。","Nanon opened the door, and the light from the hearth, reflected on the ceiling, enabled the three Cruchots to find their way into the room."
"“哈！你们是来祝贺的吧。”娜农闻见了花香，于是说道。","“Ha! You’ve come a-greeting,” said Nanon, smelling the flowers."
"“对不起，先生们，”葛朗台听出了他们的声音，便喊道，“我马上就来。我可不是摆架子，我正在修补楼梯上的一级台阶呢。”","“Excuse me, messieurs,” cried Grandet, recognizing their voices, “I’ll be with you in a moment.I’m not proud; I am patching up a step on my staircase.”"
"“继续，继续，葛朗台先生，一个人的家就是他的城堡。”庭长引经据典地说道。","“Go on, go on, Monsieur Grandet; a man’s house is his castle,” said the president sententiously."
"葛朗台太太和小姐站起身来。趁着黑暗，庭长对欧仁妮说：","Madame and Mademoiselle Grandet rose.The president, profiting by the darkness, said to Eugenie: "
"“小姐，请允许我在您生日这天，祝您年年快乐，永远都像现在一样健健康康！”","“Will you permit me, mademoiselle, to wish you, on this the day of your birth, a series of happy years and the continuance of the health which you now enjoy?”"
"他向她献上一大束索米尔城少有的高档花，然后拉起这位女继承人的臂肘，沾沾自喜地在她脖子两边各吻了一下，这让她羞红了脸。庭长的样子像个生锈的铁钉子，他以为这就是在求婚。","He offered her a huge bouquet of choice flowers which were rare in Saumur; then, taking the heiress by the elbows, he kissed her on each side of her neck with a complacency that made her blush.The president, who looked like a rusty iron nail, felt that his courtship was progressing."
"“不必拘礼，”葛朗台说着，走了进来，“过节就得像过节的样子，庭长先生！”","“Don’t stand on ceremony,” said Grandet, entering.“How well you do things on fete-days, Monsieur le president!”"
"“只要是和小姐有关，”神父手里捧着他自己的那束花说道，“对我侄子来说，那天天都是节日。”","“When it concerns mademoiselle,” said the abbe, armed with his own bouquet, “every day is a fete-day for my nephew.”"
"神父吻了吻欧仁妮的手。至于克吕绍公证人，他毫不客气地亲了她的两颊，说道：","The abbe kissed Eugenie’s hand.As for Maitre Cruchot, he boldly kissed her on both cheeks, remarking: "
"“毫无疑问，岁月催人啊！年年十二个月。”","“How we sprout up, to be sure!Every year is twelve months.”"
"葛朗台要是觉得哪句玩笑有趣，就会一直记着，不厌其烦地说来说去。他把蜡烛架放回了座钟旁，说道——","As he replaced the candlestick beside the clock, Grandet, who never forgot his own jokes, and repeated them to satiety when he thought them funny, said,—"
"“既然是欧仁妮的生日，咱们就来个灯火通明吧。”","“As this is Eugenie’s birthday let us illuminate.”"
"他小心翼翼地把烛台的托枝摘下来，给每个灯座各安了一个托盘，又从娜农手里接过一支头上卷着纸的新的油蜡烛，把它插进烛座洞里，插牢，点燃，然后坐到妻子的身旁，把他的几个朋友、女儿和那两支蜡烛挨个儿打量了一圈。克吕绍神父是一个胖乎乎、大腹便便的矮个子，戴着平踏踏的红色假发，他的脸像个嗜赌的老太婆。他脚上穿着带有银搭扣的结实皮鞋，他把双脚往前一伸，说道：","He carefully took off the branches of the candelabra, put a socket on each pedestal, took from Nanon a new tallow candle with paper twisted round the end of it, put it into the hollow, made it firm, lit it, and then sat down beside his wife, looking alternately at his friends, his daughter, and the two candles.The Abbe Cruchot, a plump, puffy little man, with a red wig plastered down and a face like an old female gambler, said as he stretched out his feet, well shod in stout shoes with silver buckles:"
"“德格拉桑一家没来吗？”"," “The des Grassins have not come?”"
"“还没有。”葛朗台说。","“Not yet,” said Grandet."
"“不过，他们会来吗？”老公证人问道，他的脸抽动着，做了个鬼脸，那张脸像漏勺一样有很多坑。","“But are they coming?” asked the old notary, twisting his face, which had as many holes as a colander, into a queer grimace."
"“我想会的。”葛朗台太太答道。","“I think so,” answered Madame Grandet."
"“您的葡萄都收完了吗？”德蓬丰先生对葛朗台说。","“Are your vintages all finished?” said Monsieur de Bonfons to Grandet."
"“是的，都收完了。”老头说着站了起来，在房间里踱来踱去，在说“都收完了”这几个字时，他得意地挺起了胸脯。从通往厨房的过道的门，他看见大个子娜农正坐在灶火旁，点着一支蜡烛，准备在那里纺线，以免打扰客人们。","“Yes, all of them,” said the old man, rising to walk up and down the room, his chest swelling with pride as he said the words, “all of them.”Through the door of the passage which led to the kitchen he saw la Grande Nanon sitting beside her fire with a candle and preparing to spin there, so as not to intrude among the guests."
"“娜农，”他说着，走进过道，“灭掉火和蜡烛，过来跟我们坐一起。当然！大厅这么大，装得下所有人。”","“Nanon,” he said, going into the passage, “put out that fire and that candle, and come and sit with us.Pardieu! The hall is big enough for all.”"
"“可是，先生，您有贵客。”","“But monsieur, you are to have the great people.”"
"“难道你不如他们吗？他们是亚当的后代，你也是。”","“Are not you as good as they?They are descended from Adam, and so are you.”"
"葛朗台走回庭长的身边，说道——　","Grandet came back to the president and said,—"
"“你把收成都卖掉了？”","“Have you sold your vintage?”"
"“没有，我没有，我要存着。如果今年酒好的话，再过两年会更好。您知道，业主们已经订好协议要维持价格，今年比利时人不会占到我们的便宜了。如果这次把他们空手打发走了，千真万确！他们还会回来的。”","“No, not I; I shall keep it.If the wine is good this year, it will be better two years hence.The proprietors, you know, have made an agreement to keep up the price; and this year the Belgians won’t get the better of us.Suppose they are sent off empty-handed for once, faith! They’ll come back.”"
"“是啊，但是咱们要专心干咱们的事。”葛朗台说道，那语气让庭长打了个寒颤。","“Yes, but let us mind what we are about,” said Grandet in a tone which made the president tremble."
"“他会去做交易吗？”克吕绍心想。","“Is he driving some bargain?” thought Cruchot."
"这时门槌响了，宣告德格拉桑一家来了，他们的到来打断了葛朗台太太和神父刚刚开始的交谈。","At this moment the knocker announced the des Grassins family, and their arrival interrupted a conversation which had begun between Madame Grandet and the abbe."
"德格拉桑太太是那种活泼、丰满的小个子女人，皮肤白里透红，由于外省修道院般的平静的生活和洁身自好的生活习惯，她虽年过四十，仍显得很年轻。她像秋天的最后一朵玫瑰——令人赏心悦目，尽管花瓣受了些霜冻，香气也仅存少许。她穿着讲究，时装都是从巴黎购买的，引领着索米尔的风尚，她还举办聚会。她丈夫以前是帝国近卫团的军需官，曾在奥斯特利茨受过重伤，此后退役，他对葛朗台虽然很尊敬，但依然保留着老兵的直率劲。","Madame des Grassins was one of those lively, plump little women, with pink-and-white skins, who, thanks to the claustral calm of the provinces and the habits of a virtuous life, keep their youth until they are past forty.She was like the last rose of autumn,—pleasant to the eye, though the petals have a certain frostiness, and their perfume is slight.She dressed well, got her fashions from Paris, set the tone to Saumur, and gave parties.Her husband, formerly a quartermaster in the Imperial guard, who had been desperately wounded at Austerlitz, and had since retired, still retained, in spite of his respect for Grandet, the seeming frankness of an old soldier."
"“晚上好，葛朗台。”他说着，伸出了手，一副高人一等的神气，他总是用这种气势来压制克吕绍叔侄。“小姐，”在朝葛朗台太太鞠了个躬之后，他转向了欧仁妮，接着说，“您总是美丽而端庄，我真的不知道该用什么话来祝福您。”说着，他递给她一个小盒子，盒子是他的仆人拿来的，里面装着一株好望角的欧石南——一种最近才进口到欧洲的花，非常稀罕。","“Good evening, Grandet,” he said, holding out his hand and affecting a sort of superiority, with which he always crushed the Cruchots.“Mademoiselle,” he added, turning to Eugenie, after bowing to Madame Grandet, “you are always beautiful and good, and truly I do not know what to wish you.”So saying, he offered her a little box which his servant had brought and which contained a Cape heather,—a flower lately imported into Europe and very rare."
"德格拉桑太太十分亲热地吻了吻欧仁妮，紧握她的手，说道：","Madame des Grassins kissed Eugenie very affectionately, pressed her hand, and said: "
"“阿道夫想把我的一件小礼物送给你。”","“Adolphe wishes to make you my little offering.”"
"一个高大的金发青年，面色苍白，身材瘦弱，举止文雅，看上去有点腼腆，不过他被送到巴黎学法律，竟花了八千或一万法郎的生活费。此时，他走过来吻了吻欧仁妮的两颊，给了她一个针线盒，里面的用具都是镀银的，尽管上面精致地雕刻着欧仁妮·葛朗台的花体式首字母，看起来极为雅致，其实只不过是个装样子的华而不实的东西。","A tall, blond young man, pale and slight, with tolerable manners and seemingly rather shy, although he had just spent eight or ten thousand francs over his allowance in Paris, where he had been sent to study law, now came forward and kissed Eugenie on both cheeks, offering her a workbox with utensils in silver-gilt,—mere show-case trumpery, in spite of the monogram E.G. in gothic letters rather well engraved, which belonged properly to something in better taste."
"当打开盒子时，欧仁妮大喜过望，那是一种使年轻姑娘脸红、发抖、颤栗的快乐。她转头看父亲，仿佛在征求许可，看能不能收下礼物，葛朗台先生答道：","As she opened it, Eugenie experienced one of those unexpected and perfect delights which make a young girl blush and quiver and tremble with pleasure.She turned her eyes to her father as if to ask permission to accept it, and Monsieur Grandet replied:"
"“收下吧，我的女儿。”那音调简直会让一个演员一举成名的。"," “Take it, my daughter,” in a tone which would have made an actor illustrious."
"当看到这位女继承人投向阿道夫的快活、兴奋的眼神时——她还从没见过这样贵重的东西呢，三位克吕绍目瞪口呆。德格拉桑先生递给葛朗台一撮儿鼻烟，自己也拿了一撮儿，掸掉落在荣誉团勋章绶带上的烟末，那绶带系在他的蓝紧身长外衣的扣眼上，然后他看着克吕绍叔侄，那神情似乎在说：“有本事你们就躲开这一招！”德格拉桑太太的目光落在那个蓝花瓶上，里面插着克吕绍送来的花束，像那种喜欢嘲弄人的女人一样，故意装出饶有兴味的样子打量着敌人的礼物。在这微妙的关键时刻，克吕绍神父离开围坐在壁炉周围的一圈人，和葛朗台到了大厅的另一头。当他们走到最远的窗口时，神父凑到守财奴的耳边说道：","The three Cruchots felt crushed as they saw the joyous, animated look cast upon Adolphe des Grassins by the heiress, to whom such riches were unheard-of.Monsieur des Grassins offered Grandet a pinch of snuff, took one himself, shook off the grains as they fell on the ribbon of the Legion of honor which was attached to the button-hole of his blue surtout; then he looked at the Cruchots with an air that seemed to say, “Parry that thrust if you can!”Madame des Grassins cast her eyes on the blue vases which held the Cruchot bouquets, looking at the enemy’s gifts with the pretended interest of a satirical woman.At this delicate juncture the Abbe Cruchot left the company seated in a circle round the fire and joined Grandet at the lower end of the hall.As the two men reached the embrasure of the farthest window the priest said in the miser’s ear: "
"“那些人是把钱往窗户外面扔。”","“Those people throw money out of the windows.”"
"“如果钱是进了我的地窖，那有什么关系？”老葡萄园主回嘴说。","“What does that matter if it gets into my cellar?” retorted the old wine-grower."
"“如果您想给女儿一把镀金剪刀，您是有办法的。”神父说道。","“If you want to give gilt scissors to your daughter, you have the means,” said the abbe."
"“我给她的东西比剪刀要好。”葛朗台回答。","“I give her something better than scissors,” answered Grandet."
"“我侄子真是个笨蛋。”神父看着庭长，心想。只见庭长头发乱蓬蓬的，他那张褐色的脸显得更难看了。“难道他就找不出什么值钱的小玩意儿？”","“My nephew is a blockhead,” thought the abbe as he looked at the president, whose rumpled hair added to the ill grace of his brown countenance.“Couldn’t he have found some little trifle which cost money?”"
"“我们陪您玩牌吧，葛朗台太太，”德格拉桑太太说道，“咱们可能需要两张桌子，因为大家都来齐了。”","“We will join you at cards, Madame Grandet,” said Madame des Grassins.“We might have two tables, as we are all here.”"
"“既然是欧仁妮的生日，你们不如一起玩摸彩吧，”葛朗台老头说道，“两个年轻人可以参加。”老箍桶匠指着自己的女儿和阿道夫，他自己从不玩任何游戏，“嗨，娜农，摆桌子。”","“As it is Eugenie’s birthday you had better play lotto all together,” said Pere Grandet, “the two young ones can join”; and the old cooper, who never played any game, motioned to his daughter and Adolphe.“Come, Nanon, set the tables.”"
"“我们会帮你的，娜农小姐。”德格拉桑太太喜滋滋地说道，很高兴讨得了欧仁妮的欢心。","“We will help you, Mademoiselle Nanon,” said Madame des Grassins gaily, quite joyous at the joy she had given Eugenie."
"“我一辈子都没这么高兴过，”女继承人对她说道，“我还从来没见过这么好看的东西。”","“I have never in my life been so pleased,” the heiress said to her, “I have never seen anything so pretty.”"
"“阿道夫从巴黎带回来的，是他亲自选的。”德格拉桑太太凑到她耳边低语道。","“Adolphe brought it from Paris, and he chose it,” Madame des Grassins whispered in her ear."
"“行了！行了！该死的家伙，诡计多端！”庭长心想，“等你在法庭有了官司，不管是你，还是你丈夫，都不会有好果子吃的。”","“Go on! Go on! Damned intriguing thing!” thought the president.“If you ever have a suit in court, you or your husband, it shall go hard with you.”"
"公证人独坐在角落里，平静地看着神父，自言自语道：","The notary, sitting in his corner, looked calmly at the abbe, saying to himself: "
"“德格拉桑一家想做什么就做什么吧，我的财产，连上我兄弟和我侄子的，总计一百一十万法郎。德格拉桑家至多有不到一半，而且，他们还有一个女儿。他们爱送什么礼就送什么礼好了，女继承人和礼物总有一天都会落进我们手里。”","“The des Grassins may do what they like; my property and my brother’s and that of my nephew amount in all to eleven hundred thousand francs.The des Grassins, at the most, have not half that; besides, they have a daughter.They may give what presents they like; heiress and presents too will be ours one of these days.”"
"晚上八点半，两张牌桌都摆好了。德格拉桑太太想办法让她儿子坐在了欧仁妮的旁边。这场戏非常有趣，尽管演员们表面上很平淡，手里拿着标有数字的条纹花色纸牌以及蓝玻璃筹码，并且好像都在听公证人讲的笑话——他每抽一个号都要说上一句，而实际上，他们都在惦记着葛朗台先生的百万家产。老箍桶匠正洋洋得意地端详着德格拉桑太太那粉色的衣着和鲜艳的盛装、银行家那威武的脑袋，还有阿道夫、庭长、神父和公证人的脸，他自言自语道——","At half-past eight in the evening the two card-tables were set out.Madame des Grassins succeeded in putting her son beside Eugenie.The actors in this scene, so full of interest, commonplace as it seems, were provided with bits of pasteboard striped in many colors and numbered, and with counters of blue glass, and they appeared to be listening to the jokes of the notary, who never drew a number without making a remark, while in fact they were all thinking of Monsieur Grandet’s millions.The old cooper, with inward self-conceit, was contemplating the pink feathers and the fresh toilet of Madame des Grassins, the martial head of the banker, the faces of Adolphe, the president, the abbe, and the notary, saying to himself:—"
"“他们都是冲着我的钱来的。哼！哪个也别想得到我女儿，不过他们倒是有些用处——可以当钓鱼用的鱼叉。”","“They are all after my money.Hey! Neither the one nor the other shall have my daughter; but they are useful—useful as harpoons to fish with.”"
"这间灰色的旧屋子点着两支油蜡烛，灯光暗淡，却洋溢着家庭的欢乐气氛；这笑声伴随着娜农的纺织机的呼呼声，只有欧仁妮和她母亲嘴上的笑才是真诚的；这琐碎平常中纠结着大利益；这个年轻姑娘就像某些被标价出售的鸟儿，现在正被人们表示出的友情所诱惑和围困，落入了他们的圈套——凡此种种，使得这一幕变成了一场可悲的喜剧。","This family gaiety in the old gray room dimly lighted by two tallow candles; this laughter, accompanied by the whirr of Nanon’s spinning-wheel, sincere only upon the lips of Eugenie or her mother; this triviality mingled with important interests; this young girl, who, like certain birds made victims of the price put upon them, was now lured and trapped by proofs of friendship of which she was the dupe,—all these things contributed to make the scene a melancholy comedy."
"而且，尽管呈现的是最为简单的形式，可它难道不是时时刻刻、随处可见的一出戏吗？葛朗台这个人物玩儿着他自己的游戏，他利用那两家人的虚情假意，从中谋取巨利，他是整场戏的中心并点明要义。单单在这张面孔上就体现了现代人信奉的唯一上帝——金钱，其法力无边。生活的温情在这里仅居次要地位，只有娜农、欧仁妮和她母亲这三颗纯洁、单纯的心能被其触动。这几个可怜的女人，她们的单纯中又有多少无知啊！欧仁妮和她母亲根本不知道葛朗台有多少财产，她们仅仅靠少许模模糊糊的想法来判断生活中的一切事情，她们对金钱既不看重也不看轻，因为她们已经习惯了不花钱的生活。她们的感情受到了伤害，尽管她们并没有意识到，却一直保持着活力，那是她们生存的秘密源泉，这也使得她们在这群只追求物质生活的人当中成为奇怪的异类。人类的处境真是可怕呀！没有哪份快乐不是来自某种无知。","Is it not, moreover, a drama of all times and all places, though here brought down to its simplest expression?The figure of Grandet, playing his own game with the false friendship of the two families and getting enormous profits from it, dominates the scene and throws light upon it.The modern god,—the only god in whom faith is preserved,—money, is here, in all its power, manifested in a single countenance.The tender sentiments of life hold here but a secondary place; only the three pure, simple hearts of Nanon, of Eugenie, and of her mother were inspired by them.And how much of ignorance there was in the simplicity of these poor women!Eugenie and her mother knew nothing of Grandet’s wealth; they could only estimate the things of life by the glimmer of their pale ideas, and they neither valued nor despised money, because they were accustomed to do without it.Their feelings, bruised, though they did not know it, but ever-living, were the secret spring of their existence, and made them curious exceptions in the midst of these other people whose lives were purely material.Frightful condition of the human race! There is no one of its joys that does not come from some species of ignorance."
"葛朗台太太赢了十六个苏的彩头——一屋子人里赢的最大一笔——大个子娜农看见夫人把彩金装进口袋，开心地大笑起来，正在这时，门口又响起了门槌声，声音很大，惊得女士们都从椅子上跳了起来。","At the moment when Madame Grandet had won a lotto of sixteen sous,—the largest ever pooled in that house,—and while la Grande Nanon was laughing with delight as she watched madame pocketing her riches, the knocker resounded on the house-door with such a noise that the women all jumped in their chairs."
"“在索米尔可没人这样敲门。”公证人说道。","“There is no man in Saumur who would knock like that,” said the notary."
"“他们怎么能那样砰砰地敲门呢！”娜农大声叫嚷道，“他们想破门而入吗？”","“How can they bang in that way!” exclaimed Nanon, “do they want to break in the door?”"
"“到底是谁呀？”葛朗台喊道。","“Who the devil is it?” cried Grandet."
"第三章","Chapter III "
"娜农拿起其中一支蜡烛去开门，身后跟着她的主人。","Nanon took one of the candles and went to open the door, followed by her master."
"“葛朗台！葛朗台！”他的妻子突然感到一阵恐慌，大叫着往门口跑去。","“Grandet! Grandet!” cried his wife, moved by a sudden impulse of fear, and running to the door of the room."
"打牌的人全都面面相觑。","All the players looked at each other."
"“咱们都去吧，怎么样？”德格拉桑先生说，“这敲门声让我感觉来者不善。”","“Suppose we all go?” said Monsieur des Grassins, “that knock strikes me as evil-intentioned.”"
"德格拉桑先生瞥见一个年轻男子的身影，身影后跟着驿站的搬运工，扛着两个大旅行箱，拖着一个旅行包，这时，葛朗台先生突然转身对他妻子说道——","Hardly was Monsieur des Grassins allowed to see the figure of a young man, accompanied by a porter from the coach-office carrying two large trunks and dragging a carpet-bag after him, than Monsieur Grandet turned roughly on his wife and said,—"
"“葛朗台太太，回去玩你们的摸彩去，我来招呼这位先生。”","“Madame Grandet, go back to your lotto; leave me to speak with monsieur.”"
"然后他很快拉上了门，兴奋的玩家们回到了各自的座位上，但没有接着玩儿下去。","Then he pulled the door quickly, and the excited players returned to their seats, but did not continue the game."
"“是索米尔的人吗，德格拉桑先生？”他妻子问道。","“Is it any one belonging to Saumur, Monsieur des Grassins?” asked his wife."
"“不是，是个外地的。”","“No, it is a traveller.”"
"“他一定是从巴黎来的。”","“He must have come from Paris.”"
"“对极了，”公证人说着，取出了他的表，那块表有两英寸厚，样子像一艘荷兰军舰，“九点了，交通局的驿车倒是从不晚点。”","“Just so,” said the notary, pulling out his watch, which was two inches thick and looked like a Dutch man-of-war, “it’s nine o’clock; the diligence of the Grand Bureau is never late.”"
"“那位先生是个年轻人吧？”克吕绍神父问道。","“Is the gentleman young?” inquired the Abbe Cruchot."
"“是的，”德格拉桑先生回答，“他带来的行李，差不多有三吨重。”","“Yes,” answered Monsieur des Grassins, “and he has brought luggage which must weigh nearly three tons.”"
"“娜农没回来。”欧仁妮说道。","“Nanon does not come back,” said Eugenie."
"“肯定是你们家的一个亲戚。”庭长说。","“It must be one of your relations,” remarked the president."
"“咱们继续玩吧，”葛朗台太太轻声说道，“听葛朗台先生的口气，我想他是生气了，发现咱们谈论他的事，他也许会不高兴的。”","“Let us go on with our game,” said Madame Grandet gently.“I know from Monsieur Grandet’s tone of voice that he is annoyed; perhaps he would not like to find us talking of his affairs.”"
"“小姐，”阿道夫对她的邻座说，“毫无疑问，那是你的堂弟葛朗台——一个很英俊的年轻人，我在德纽沁根先生家的舞会上见过他。”阿道夫没有继续说下去，因为他母亲踩了他一脚，然后大声问他要两个苏来给她下注，她低声说道：","“Mademoiselle,” said Adolphe to his neighbor, “it is no doubt your cousin Grandet,—a very good-looking young man; I met him at the ball of Monsieur de Nucingen.”Adolphe did not go on, for his mother trod on his toes; and then, asking him aloud for two sous to put on her stake, she whispered: "
"“你能住嘴吗，你个大傻瓜！”","“Will you hold your tongue, you great goose!”"
"这时葛朗台回来了，大个子娜农没跟着回来，她和搬运工的脚步声在楼梯上回响着，他们正在上楼。葛朗台身后跟着那个远道来客，他刚才曾激发了在座者的好奇心和活跃的想象力，所以等他进了屋子，突然来到这群人的中间，就好比是一只蜗牛进了蜂窝，或是一只孔雀进了某个农家养家禽的棚子。","At this moment Grandet returned, without la Grande Nanon, whose steps, together with those of the porter, echoed up the staircase; and he was followed by the traveller who had excited such curiosity and so filled the lively imaginations of those present that his arrival at this dwelling, and his sudden fall into the midst of this assembly, can only be likened to that of a snail into a beehive, or the introduction of a peacock into some village poultry-yard."
"“坐到壁炉旁边吧。”葛朗台说。","“Sit down near the fire,” said Grandet."
"落座之前，这个年轻的陌生人非常得体地向大家行了礼。男士们站起来礼貌地欠身还礼，而女士们则按照礼节屈膝行礼。","Before seating himself, the young stranger saluted the assembled company very gracefully.The men rose to answer by a courteous inclination, and the women made a ceremonious bow."
"“你一定觉着冷吧，先生，”葛朗台太太说，“你大概是从——”","“You are cold, no doubt, monsieur,” said Madame Grandet, “you have, perhaps, travelled from—” "
"“婆婆妈妈！”老葡萄园主停下正看着的一封信，抬起头说道，“让这位先生歇一歇！”","“Just like all women!” said the old wine-grower, looking up from a letter he was reading.“Do let monsieur rest himself!”"
"“可是，父亲，也许这位先生需要点什么。”欧仁妮说。","“But, father, perhaps monsieur would like to take something,” said Eugenie."
"“他自己有嘴。”老头厉声说道。","“He has got a tongue,” said the old man sternly."
"这个陌生人是唯一对此场景感到吃惊的人，其余所有人早就习惯了男主人的这种霸道劲儿。但是在两番问答之后，新到者还是站了起来，转身背对壁炉，抬起一只脚来烤靴底，并对欧仁妮说——","The stranger was the only person surprised by this scene; all the others were well-used to the despotic ways of the master.However, after the two questions and the two replies had been exchanged, the newcomer rose, turned his back towards the fire, lifted one foot so as to warm the sole of its boot, and said to Eugenie,—"
"“谢谢你，堂姐，不过我在图尔吃过晚饭了。而且，”他看了看葛朗台，又说道，“我什么都不需要， 一点儿也不累。”","“Thank you, my cousin, but I dined at Tours.And,” he added, looking at Grandet, “I need nothing; I am not even tired.”"
"“先生是从首都来的？”德格拉桑太太问道。","“Monsieur has come from the capital?” asked Madame des Grassins."
"夏尔先生——这是巴黎葛朗台先生的儿子的名字——听到有人跟自己说话，拿起一只链子挂在脖子上的小单片眼镜，戴在右眼上仔细看着桌子上的东西，又看看围坐在桌子边的人。所有想看的都看过之后，他非常放肆地盯着德格拉桑太太，对她说——","Monsieur Charles,—such was the name of the son of Monsieur Grandet of Paris,—hearing himself addressed, took a little eye-glass, suspended by a chain from his neck, applied it to his right eye to examine what was on the table, and also the persons sitting round it.He ogled Madame des Grassins with much impertinence, and said to her, after he had observed all he wished,—"
"“是的，夫人。你们在摸彩，伯母，”他接着说，“请别因为我打断你们，请继续玩儿吧：太好玩儿了，别停下。”","“Yes, madame. You are playing at lotto, aunt,” he added.“Do not let me interrupt you, I beg; go on with your game: it is too amusing to leave.”"
"“我敢肯定这就是那位堂弟。”德格拉桑太太一边想着，一边不住地瞟着他。","“I was certain it was the cousin,” thought Madame des Grassins, casting repeated glances at him."
"“四十七！”老神父大声叫道，“记上它，德格拉桑太太。那不是您的号吗？”","“Forty-seven!” cried the old abbe.“Mark it down, Madame des Grassins.Isn’t that your number?”"
"德格拉桑先生往他妻子的牌上放了一个筹码，他妻子坐着，根本没把心思放在摸彩上，她先是看看那位从巴黎来的堂弟，然后又看看欧仁妮，有了一种悲凉的不祥预感。年轻的女继承人不时地偷偷打量着她的堂弟，银行家的妻子很容易就看出了她内心里那越来越强烈的惊讶和好奇。","Monsieur des Grassins put a counter on his wife’s card, who sat watching first the cousin from Paris and then Eugenie, without thinking of her lotto, a prey to mournful presentiments.From time to time the young heiress glanced furtively at her cousin, and the banker’s wife easily detected a @crescendo@ of surprise and curiosity in her mind."
"夏尔·葛朗台先生是一个二十二岁的英俊青年，此刻与这些地道的外省人形成了一种奇特的对照，他们非常厌恶他的贵族气派，都在细细打量他，打算讽刺挖苦他一番。这需要解释一下。在二十二岁的时候，年轻人还稚气未脱，他们的行为举止经常会显得很幼稚。很可能，他们一百个人当中，就有九十九个人的行为举止会和夏尔·葛朗台先生现在的表现一模一样。","Monsieur Charles Grandet, a handsome young man of twenty-two, presented at this moment a singular contrast to the worthy provincials, who, considerably disgusted by his aristocratic manners, were all studying him with sarcastic intent.This needs an explanation.At twenty-two, young people are still so near childhood that they often conduct themselves childishly.In all probability, out of every hundred of them fully ninety-nine would have behaved precisely as Monsieur Charles Grandet was now behaving."
"几天前，他父亲吩咐他去索米尔的伯父家住上几个月。葛朗台先生可能想到了欧仁妮。夏尔平生第一次被差遣到外省来，便设想着要摆出时尚人士那高人一等的派头来，让整个郡的人都因他的阔绰而自惭形秽，同时还希望他此行能开风气之先，将巴黎生活的高雅精致引入到这偏僻之隅。简而言之，一句话，他打算在索米尔比在巴黎花更多的时间涂抹他的指甲，在衣着上要格外漂亮雅致，而有些时髦的年轻人往往会故意不修边幅，好显得更潇洒些。夏尔因此随身带了一整套猎装，巴黎最漂亮的猎枪和最好的猎刀，猎刀配有最漂亮的刀鞘。他带来了一整套的马甲。马甲有各种各样的——灰的，黑的，白的，金甲壳虫色的：有些闪着金色，有些装饰着金属片，有些织着云纹；有些是双排扣的，交叠着像块长方形披巾，有些是直领的；有些是翻领的，有些则从上到下都扣着镀金纽扣。他带来了那个时代最流行的各种硬领和领带。他还带来了两套比松外套和他所有最好的内衣。他还带来了一套漂亮的纯金梳洗用具——这是他母亲送他的礼物。他带来了公子哥儿的所有玩意儿，连一个精致的小文具盒都没忘，那是一位最可爱的女士送的——至少他觉得可爱——一位他称为安妮特的时髦女子，此刻正疲惫不堪地和丈夫一起在苏格兰旅行，因受某种猜忌中伤而不得不暂时牺牲一下幸福。文具盒里有很多漂亮的信纸，他可以每两周给她写一封信。","Some days earlier than this his father had told him to go and spend several months with his uncle at Saumur.Perhaps Monsieur Grandet was thinking of Eugenie.Charles, sent for the first time in his life into the provinces, took a fancy to make his appearance with the superiority of a man of fashion, to reduce the whole arrondissement to despair by his luxury, and to make his visit an epoch, importing into those country regions all the refinements of Parisian life.In short, to explain it in one word, he mean to pass more time at Saumur in brushing his nails than he ever thought of doing in Paris, and to assume the extra nicety and elegance of dress which a young man of fashion often lays aside for a certain negligence which in itself is not devoid of grace.Charles therefore brought with him a complete hunting-costume, the finest gun, the best hunting-knife in the prettiest sheath to be found in all Paris.He brought his whole collection of waistcoats.They were of all kinds,—gray, black, white, scarabaeus-colored: some were shot with gold, some spangled, some @chined@; some were double-breasted and crossed like a shawl, others were straight in the collar; some had turned-over collars, some buttoned up to the top with gilt buttons.He brought every variety of collar and cravat in fashion at that epoch.He brought two of Buisson’s coats and all his finest linen. He brought his pretty gold toilet-set,—a present from his mother.He brought all his dandy knick-knacks, not forgetting a ravishing little desk presented to him by the most amiable of women,—amiable for him, at least,—a fine lady whom he called Annette and who at this moment was travelling, matrimonially and wearily, in Scotland, a victim to certain suspicions which required a passing sacrifice of happiness; in the desk was much pretty note-paper on which to write to her once a fortnight."
"总之，他尽可能带全了巴黎浮华生活的全套行头——从决斗开场时用的小马鞭，到结束决斗时用的雕花精美的手枪，游手好闲的年轻人打发日子的整套家当，他是应有尽有。他父亲曾嘱咐他单独出行，不要铺张，他就独自包了一辆轿式驿车，很高兴不用糟蹋那辆漂亮的旅行马车了，那是他专门定做的，打算明年六月坐着到巴登温泉和那位贵妇人——他的安妮特相会的。夏尔猜想在他伯父家会见到很多人，还能到伯父家的森林里打猎——总之，过上典型的庄园生活。他不知道伯父住在索米尔，只是在打听去弗罗瓦丰的路时顺便问到了他。当得知伯父就在城里时，他以为伯父应该住在一座豪宅里。","In short, it was as complete a cargo of Parisian frivolities as it was possible for him to get together,—a collection of all the implements of husbandry with which the youth of leisure tills his life, from the little whip which helps to begin a duel, to the handsomely chased pistols which end it.His father having told him to travel alone and modestly, he had taken the coupe of the diligence all to himself, rather pleased at not having to damage a delightful travelling-carriage ordered for a journey on which he was to meet his Annette, the great lady who, etc.,—whom he intended to rejoin at Baden in the following June.Charles expected to meet scores of people at his uncle’s house, to hunt in his uncle’s forests,—to live, in short, the usual chateau life; he did not know that his uncle was in Saumur, and had only inquired about him incidentally when asking the way to Froidfond.Hearing that he was in town, he supposed that he should find him in a suitable mansion."
"索米尔也好，弗罗瓦丰也好，为了在见伯父的第一面时显得体面些，他穿上了他最高雅的旅行套装，简单却精致，用当时概括一个人或一件东西完美无缺的词来讲，就是“妙极了”。在图尔，一个理发师把他那一头漂亮的栗色头发重新烫了一下。他在那里换了内衣，戴上了一条黑缎子领带，配上圆衬衣领，把他那笑吟吟的漂亮脸蛋衬托得更可爱了。一件旅行长大衣的扣子只扣了一半并卡着腰，露出了前开口的开司米毛背心，里面还有一件白布背心。他的表上面拴着一条短的金表链，很随意地放在一个口袋里，并系在了扣眼上。他的灰色裤子两边系扣，接缝口饰有黑色丝绸绣花图案。他优雅地挥着一根手杖，手杖上的雕花金手柄并没有令他那副灰色手套有分毫减色。最后，他的帽子也是品位高雅的。只有巴黎人，而且是上层圈子的巴黎人，才可以这样打扮而不会显得滑稽可笑，其他人是无法将自命不凡和所有这些纨绔子弟的做派协调起来的，不过，这副做派倒是因为那股帅气而被人接受了——一个年轻人有漂亮的手枪，百发百中的枪法，还有安妮特。","In order that he might make a becoming first appearance before his uncle either at Saumur or at Froidfond, he had put on his most elegant travelling attire, simple yet exquisite,—“adorable,” to use the word which in those days summed up the special perfections of a man or a thing.At Tours a hairdresser had re-curled his beautiful chestnut locks; there he changed his linen and put on a black satin cravat, which, combined with a round shirt-collar, framed his fair and smiling countenance agreeably.A travelling great-coat, only half buttoned up, nipped in his waist and disclosed a cashmere waistcoat crossed in front, beneath which was another waistcoat of white material.His watch, negligently slipped into a pocket, was fastened by a short gold chain to a buttonhole.His gray trousers, buttoned up at the sides, were set off at the seams with patterns of black silk embroidery.He gracefully twirled a cane, whose chased gold knob did not mar the freshness of his gray gloves.And to complete all, his cap was in excellent taste.None but a Parisian, and a Parisian of the upper spheres, could thus array himself without appearing ridiculous; none other could give the harmony of self-conceit to all these fopperies, which were carried off, however, with a dashing air,—the air of a young man who has fine pistols, a sure aim, and Annette."
"现在，如果你想了解这群外省人和这个年轻的巴黎人对彼此的惊讶，如果你想看清来客的高雅风度在屋子那灰暗的阴影和屋里所有人的脸上投下的光彩，就使劲在你的脑海里想象一下三位克吕绍的样子吧。三个人都吸鼻烟，鼻涕流出来，许久都不去理会，泛黄的衬衣褶边和皱巴巴的领子那发黄的折缝上散落着褐色污渍，他们也长时间没有清洗过。他们软塌塌的领带一系上脖子就拧得像绳子一样。他们的衬衣特别多，足可以六个月才洗一次衣服，在这期间，那些衬衣就都放在柜底，日子久了，上面沾满了污迹和霉斑。不修边幅和衰老在他们身上很好地融合起来，他们的脸像他们破旧的衣服一样褪了色，像他们的裤子一样打了皱，是衰老的、干瘪的，又是皱巴巴的。至于其他人，都普遍不讲究穿着，像所有外省人的着装一样，衣服不配套，也不光鲜，外省人下意识里觉得穿衣打扮不是为了给别人看，他们非常关心的是一副手套的价格，这与克吕绍家的不修边幅倒是一致的。　厌恶时髦是德格拉桑派和克吕绍派唯一意见一致的地方。","Now if you wish to understand the mutual amazement of the provincial party and the young Parisian; if you would clearly see the brilliance which the traveller’s elegance cast among the gray shadows of the room and upon the faces of this family group,—endeavor to picture to your minds the Cruchots.All three took snuff, and had long ceased to repress the habit of snivelling or to remove the brown blotches which strewed the frills of their dingy shirts and the yellowing creases of their crumpled collars.Their flabby cravats were twisted into ropes as soon as they wound them about their throats.The enormous quantity of linen which allowed these people to have their clothing washed only once in six months, and to keep it during that time in the depths of their closets, also enabled time to lay its grimy and decaying stains upon it.There was perfect unison of ill-grace and senility about them; their faces, as faded as their threadbare coats, as creased as their trousers, were worn-out, shrivelled-up, and puckered.As for the others, the general negligence of their dress, which was incomplete and wanting in freshness,—like the toilet of all country places, where insensibly people cease to dress for others and come to think seriously of the price of a pair of gloves,—was in keeping with the negligence of the Cruchots.A horror of fashion was the only point on which the Grassinists and the Cruchotines agreed."
"这个巴黎人拿起他的眼镜，仔细审视这所住宅里古怪的陈设——天花板的托梁，木构件的颜色以及上面的斑迹，那是苍蝇留下的，数量多得简直可以给《箴言报》和《百科全书》加标点了。这时，玩摸彩的人们抬起头看着他，那好奇的神情就像在看一只长颈鹿。对德格拉桑先生和他的儿子来说，一个年轻人打扮入时的样子并不新奇，但是，他们也和在座的其他人一样感到惊讶，也许是受到了大众情绪无以名状的感染，也许是和其他人的看法一样，他们也同样露出嘲弄的目光来，似乎在对同乡说——","When the Parisian took up his eye-glass to examine the strange accessories of this dwelling,—the joists of the ceiling, the color of the woodwork, and the specks which the flies had left there in sufficient number to punctuate the “Moniteur” and the “Encyclopaedia of Sciences,”—the lotto-players lifted their noses and looked at him with as much curiosity as they might have felt about a giraffe.Monsieur des Grassins and his son, to whom the appearance of a man of fashion was not wholly unknown, were nevertheless as much astonished as their neighbors, whether it was that they fell under the indefinable influence of the general feeling, or that they really shared it as with satirical glances they seemed to say to their compatriots,—"
"“这就是你们在巴黎能见到的！”","“That is what you see in Paris!”"
"他们可以悠闲地打量着夏尔，而不必担心会惹这家的主人不高兴。葛朗台正全神贯注地看着握在他手里的那封长信。为了看信，他拿走了牌桌上唯一的蜡烛，全然没有理会他的客人们，也不顾他们的兴致。欧仁妮来从没见识过这样完美的衣着和人物，她简直都觉得在堂弟的身上看到了从天而降的天使。那颗漂亮的脑袋上顶着优美的卷发，她愉快地闻着从上面飘出来的香气。那双手套很精致，用小山羊皮做成的，软软的，她真想摸一摸。她羡慕夏尔的小手、他的肤色和他脸庞的娇嫩精美。总之，这位优雅的人物对她这个没见过世面的女孩所产生的影响大致如此。这女孩总是一刻不停地忙于修补袜子或是她父亲的衣服，她的生活就在这些肮脏的椽木下慢慢过着，除了见到寂静的街上偶尔经过的路人外，别人谁都看不见。见到她的堂弟时，她的心里泛起了一阵萌动，就像一个年轻人看到了韦斯特福尔为英语《文集》所画、由芬登兄弟所雕刻的娇美的女士画像，会为之动情一样，那画像用笔如此精妙，以至于我们担心往纸上吹口气，那些天仙就会被吹走。","They were able to examine Charles at their leisure without fearing to displease the master of the house.Grandet was absorbed in the long letter which he held in his hand; and to read it he had taken the only candle upon the card-table, paying no heed to his guests or their pleasure.Eugenie, to whom such a type of perfection, whether of dress or of person, was absolutely unknown, thought she beheld in her cousin a being descended from seraphic spheres.She inhaled with delight the fragrance wafted from the graceful curls of that brilliant head.She would have liked to touch the soft kid of the delicate gloves.She envied Charles his small hands, his complexion, the freshness and refinement of his features.In short,—if it is possible to sum up the effect this elegant being produced upon an ignorant young girl perpetually employed in darning stockings or in mending her father’s clothes, and whose life flowed on beneath these unclean rafters, seeing none but occasional passers along the silent street,—this vision of her cousin roused in her soul an emotion of delicate desire like that inspired in a young man by the fanciful pictures of women drawn by Westall for the English “Keepsakes,” and that engraved by the Findens with so clever a tool that we fear, as we breathe upon the paper, that the celestial apparitions may be wafted away."
"夏尔从他的口袋里掏出一块手绢，是那位此时正在苏格兰游历的贵妇人绣的。当欧仁妮看到这件闲暇时怀着热恋完成的精品时，她瞅着堂弟，看他是否真会拿来用。这个年轻人的举止、手势、拿起长柄眼镜的样子、装模作样的傲慢、对那个刚才博得富家小姐欢心的针线盒的不屑一顾，他显然认为那是毫无价值的，甚至是可笑的——所有这一切，令克吕绍和德格拉桑两家人深感震惊，却让欧仁妮喜欢得要命，她睡觉前还老想着这位出类拔萃的堂弟。","Charles drew from his pocket a handkerchief embroidered by the great lady now travelling in Scotland.As Eugenie saw this pretty piece of work, done in the vacant hours which were lost to love, she looked at her cousin to see if it were possible that he meant to make use of it.The manners of the young man, his gestures, the way in which he took up his eye-glass, his affected superciliousness, his contemptuous glance at the coffer which had just given so much pleasure to the rich heiress, and which he evidently regarded as without value, or even as ridiculous,—all these things, which shocked the Cruchots and the des Grassins, pleased Eugenie so deeply that before she slept she dreamed long dreams of her phoenix cousin."
"彩号抽得很慢，不久游戏突然结束了。大个子娜农走进来，大声说道：","The lotto-numbers were drawn very slowly, and presently the game came suddenly to an end.La Grand Nanon entered and said aloud: "
"“夫人，我要先生床上的床单。”","“Madame, I want the sheets for monsieur’s bed.”"
"葛朗台太太跟着她出去了。德格拉桑太太低声说道：","Madame Grandet followed her out.Madame des Grassins said in a low voice: "
"“咱们把钱收起来，别玩儿了。”","“Let us keep our sous and stop playing.”"
"众人从他们放钱用的缺了口的小碟里拿起自己的两个苏，然后一起都坐到了壁炉边。","Each took his or her two sous from the chipped saucer in which they had been put; then the party moved in a body toward the fire."
"“你们不玩儿了？”葛朗台没有抬头，继续看着信说道。","“Have you finished your game?” said Grandet, without looking up from his letter."
"“是啊，是啊！”德格拉桑太太一边答道，一边挨着夏尔坐下。","“Yes, yes!” replied Madame des Grassins, taking a seat near Charles."
"像很多初次春心萌动的少女一样，欧仁妮突然闪了个念头，她离开屋子，去帮她母亲和娜农了。如果那时有个能干的告解神甫盘问她，毫无疑问，她会坦率地承认她既没想着母亲，也没想着娜农，而是一门心思在她堂弟身上，急切地想为堂弟的卧室张罗张罗，看看需要添置些什么东西，有没有什么疏漏，要尽可能样样周全，让房间既舒适又漂亮。而实际上，她及时赶到了，向她母亲和娜农证明一切都还没做到位。","Eugenie, prompted by a thought often born in the heart of a young girl when sentiment enters it for the first time, left the room to go and help her mother and Nanon.Had an able confessor then questioned her she would, no doubt, have avowed to him that she thought neither of her mother nor of Nanon, but was pricked by a poignant desire to look after her cousin’s room and concern herself with her cousin; to supply what might be needed, to remedy any forgetfulness, to see that all was done to make it, as far as possible, suitable and elegant; and, in fact, she arrived in time to prove to her mother and Nanon that everything still remained to be done."
"她提醒娜农拿只暖床炉来暖暖被褥。她亲自往旧桌子上铺了块桌布，嘱咐娜农每天早上要更换；她说服母亲，必须生旺炉火，并敦促娜农瞒着她父亲，把一大堆木柴放到走廊里。她跑过去，从大厅的一个角柜拿了一只古漆盘子，那是已故的德拉贝尔特利耶先生的遗物，同时还拿了一只六棱水晶高脚杯、一把失去光泽的镀金勺子和一个刻着丘比特的旧水瓶，她得意洋洋地把这些东西全都放在堂弟卧室的壁炉台角上。在这一刻钟里，她脑子里涌现的想法比她出生以来所有想法还要多。","She put into Nanon’s head the notion of passing a warming-pan between the sheets.She herself covered the old table with a cloth and requested Nanon to change it every morning; she convinced her mother that it was necessary to light a good fire, and persuaded Nanon to bring up a great pile of wood into the corridor without saying anything to her father.She ran to get, from one of the corner-shelves of the hall, a tray of old lacquer which was part of the inheritance of the late Monsieur de la Bertelliere, catching up at the same time a six-sided crystal goblet, a little tarnished gilt spoon, an antique flask engraved with cupids, all of which she put triumphantly on the corner of her cousin’s chimney-piece.More ideas surged through her head in one quarter of an hour than she had ever had since she came into the world."
"“妈妈，”她说，“我堂弟绝对受不了油蜡烛的气味，咱们买支白蜡烛怎么样？”说着她像只小鸟一样轻快地冲了出去，拿来她刚得到的五法郎，那是她每月的零花钱。“喂，娜农，”她叫着，“快点！”","“Mamma,” she said, “my cousin will never bear the smell of a tallow candle; suppose we buy a wax one?”And she darted, swift as a bird, to get the five-franc piece which she had just received for her monthly expenses.“Here, Nanon,” she cried, “quick!”"
"“你父亲会怎么说呀？”当看到女儿拿起一只旧塞夫尔糖罐时——那是葛朗台从弗罗瓦丰庄园带回来的，葛朗台太太厉声反对道，“还有，你去哪里弄到糖呢？你疯了吗？”","“What will your father say?”This terrible remonstrance was uttered by Madame Grandet as she beheld her daughter armed with an old Sevres sugar-basin which Grandet had brought home from the chateau of Froidfond.“And where will you get the sugar?Are you crazy?”"
"“妈妈，娜农买蜡烛时，可以买些糖。”","“Mamma, Nanon can buy some sugar as well as the candle.”"
"“可你父亲呢？”","“But your father?”"
"“可他侄子不能连杯糖水也喝不上吧？而且，他不会注意这个的。”","“Surely his nephew ought not to go without a glass of @eau sucree@?Besides, he will not notice it.”"
"“什么也逃不过你父亲的眼睛。”葛朗台太太说着，摇了摇头。","“Your father sees everything,” said Madame Grandet, shaking her head."
"娜农犹豫着，她很了解她的主人。","Nanon hesitated; she knew her master."
"“拜托，娜农，去吧——因为今天是我的生日。”","“Come, Nanon, go,—because it is my birthday.”"
"当听到她年轻的女主人头一次开起了玩笑，娜农大笑起来，然后照她的吩咐做去了。","Nanon gave a loud laugh as she heard the first little jest her young mistress had ever made, and then obeyed her."
"正当欧仁妮和她母亲千方百计布置葛朗台先生为侄子安排的卧室时，德格拉桑太太正向夏尔大献殷勤，从表面来看，她正在挑逗夏尔。","While Eugenie and her mother were trying to embellish the bedroom assigned by Monsieur Grandet for his nephew, Charles himself was the object of Madame des Grassins’ attentions; to all appearances she was setting her cap at him."
"“您非常勇敢，先生，”她对年轻的时髦公子说道，“在这个季节不在首都好好享受，却跑到了索米尔。不过，要是您没有被我们吓跑的话，您会发现，即使在这里也是有些乐趣的。”","“You are very courageous, monsieur,” she said to the young dandy, “to leave the pleasures of the capital at this season and take up your abode in Saumur.But if we do not frighten you away, you will find there are some amusements even here.”"
"她向他抛了个外省式的媚眼。在外省，女人们的眼中有太多的拘谨和矜持，反而使她们的眼神中流露出一种假装正经的色欲，那正是某些将一切娱乐视为盗窃或罪过的教士所特有的神态。夏尔在这个宅子里觉得非常不自在，这所宅子同想象中伯父应有的巨大庄园和奢华生活相去甚远，所以在看着德格拉桑太太时，他察觉出她的脸上有模模糊糊巴黎人的影子。他优雅地答复了对他的邀约，然后非常自然地开始了交谈。交谈中，德格拉桑太太渐渐压低了嗓门，以便与她正说的悄悄话合上拍。她和夏尔一样，都有说说悄悄话的需要，所以，调了一会儿情，又开了几个一本正经的玩笑之后，想着不会被别人听到——其他人正在谈论时下索米尔人都关心的酒市行情，这位聪明的外省人说道——","She threw him the ogling glance of the provinces, where women put so much prudence and reserve into their eyes that they impart to them the prudish concupiscence peculiar to certain ecclesiastics to whom all pleasure is either a theft or an error.Charles was so completely out of his element in this abode, and so far from the vast chateau and the sumptuous life with which his fancy had endowed his uncle, that as he looked at Madame des Grassins he perceived a dim likeness to Parisian faces.He gracefully responded to the species of invitation addressed to him, and began very naturally a conversation, in which Madame des Grassins gradually lowered her voice so as to bring it into harmony with the nature of the confidences she was making.With her, as with Charles, there was the need of conference; so after a few moments spent in coquettish phrases and a little serious jesting, the clever provincial said, thinking herself unheard by the others, who were discussing the sale of wines which at that season filled the heads of every one in Saumur,—"
"“先生，如果您肯赏脸光临寒舍，我丈夫和我都会感到非常荣幸。我们的沙龙是索米尔的商界巨头和贵族聚会的唯一场所。我们都是这两个阶层的成员，他们来我们家会面，仅仅是因为他们觉得有意思。我丈夫——我敢自豪地说——在两个圈子都颇受敬重。在您小住期间，我们会尽量给您解解闷。假如您总是和葛朗台先生呆在一起，天哪！您会变成什么样啊？您的伯父是个贪婪的吝啬鬼，一心只想着他的葡萄藤；您的伯母是个虔诚的教徒，没什么主见；您的堂姐是个小傻瓜，没受过教育，非常粗俗，没有嫁妆，一辈子就是缝缝补补。”","“Monsieur, if you will do us the honor to come and see us, you will give as much pleasure to my husband as to myself.Our salon is the only one in Saumur where you will find the higher business circles mingling with the nobility.We belong to both societies, who meet at our house simply because they find it amusing.My husband—I say it with pride—is as much valued by the one class as by the other.We will try to relieve the monotony of your visit here.If you stay all the time with Monsieur Grandet, good heavens! What will become of you?Your uncle is a sordid miser who thinks of nothing but his vines; your aunt is a pious soul who can’t put two ideas together; and your cousin is a little fool, without education, perfectly common, no fortune, who will spend her life in darning towels.”"
"“这个女人确实不错。”夏尔·葛朗台一边想着，一边适时地应付着德格拉桑太太的卖弄风情。","“She is really very nice, this woman,” thought Charles Grandet as he duly responded to Madame des Grassins’ coquetries."
"“太太，我看你要独霸这位先生了。”壮实的银行家笑着说道。","“It seems to me, wife, that you are taking possession of monsieur,” said the stout banker, laughing."
"听到这句话，公证人和庭长也说了几句不咸不淡的俏皮话，可是神父却狡猾地看着他们，他捏了一撮儿鼻烟，一边向大家让着他的鼻烟壶，一边把众人的想法概括了一下，说道：","On this remark the notary and the president said a few words that were more or less significant; but the abbe, looking at them slyly, brought their thoughts to a focus by taking a pinch of snuff and saying as he handed round his snuff-box: "
"“要为这位先生尽到地主之谊，索米尔有谁能比得上夫人呢？”","“Who can do the honors of Saumur for monsieur so well as madame?”"
"“啊！您的话什么意思，神父先生？”德格拉桑先生问道。","“Ah! What do you mean by that, monsieur l’abbe?” demanded Monsieur des Grassins."
"“我这话对您、对夫人、对索米尔城，还有对这位先生都是一番好意。”狡猾的老家伙一边说，一边转向了夏尔。","“I mean it in the best possible sense for you, for madame, for the town of Saumur, and for monsieur,” said the wily old man, turning to Charles."
"克吕绍神父已猜到了夏尔和德格拉桑太太之间的谈话内容，表面却装着没有注意的样子。","The Abbe Cruchot had guessed the conversation between Charles and Madame des Grassins without seeming to pay attention to it."
"“先生，”阿道夫带着一副故作轻松随意的神情，对夏尔说道，“我不知道您是否记得我，但是在德纽沁根男爵举办的舞会上，我曾有幸见过您一面，而且——”","“Monsieur,” said Adolphe to Charles with an air which he tried to make free and easy, “I don’t know whether you remember me, but I had the honor of dancing as your @vis-a-vis@ at a ball given by the Baron de Nucingen, and—” "
"“没错，我记得很清楚，先生。”夏尔回答道，很高兴地发现自己成了大家关注的对象。","“Perfectly; I remember perfectly, monsieur,” answered Charles, pleased to find himself the object of general attention."
"“这位先生是您的儿子吗？”他对德格拉桑太太说道。","“Monsieur is your son?” he said to Madame des Grassins."
"神父不怀好意看着她。","The abbe looked at her maliciously."
"“是的，先生。”她回答道。","“Yes, monsieur,” she answered."
"“那您很年轻就去巴黎了？”夏尔向阿道夫问道。","“Then you were very young when you were in Paris?” said Charles, addressing Adolphe."
"“您肯定知道，先生，”神父说，“他们一断奶，我们就把他们送到巴比伦那样的花花世界了。”","“You must know, monsieur,” said the abbe, “that we send them to Babylon as soon as they are weaned.”"
"德格拉桑太太审视着神父，一眼就看穿了他。","Madame des Grassins examined the abbe with a glance of extreme penetration."
"“只有在外省，”他接着说，“您才能见到像夫人一样三十出头、仍然充满青春活力的女人，看看，儿子都快拿上学位了。我简直觉得自己又回到了过去的时光，那时年轻人都站在舞厅的椅子上看您跳舞，夫人。”神父扭身对他的女对手说道，“对我来说，您的辉煌仿佛就是在昨天——”","“It is only in the provinces,” he continued, “that you will find women of thirty and more years as fresh as madame, here, with a son about to take his degree.I almost fancy myself back in the days when the young men stood on chairs in the ball-room to see you dance, madame,” said the abbe, turning to his female adversary.“To me, your triumphs are but of yesterday—” "
"“这个老浑蛋！”德格拉桑太太心想，“难道他已经猜出了我的心思？”","“The old rogue!” thought Madame Grassins, “can he have guessed my intentions?”"
"“看来我会在索米尔大出风头的。”夏尔一边想着，一边解开了他大衣的纽扣，将一只手放进马甲里，目视远方，模仿着尚特雷塑造的拜伦勋爵的姿势。","“It seems that I shall have a good deal of success in Saumur,” thought Charles as he unbuttoned his great-coat, put a hand into his waistcoat, and cast a glance into the far distance, to imitate the attitude which Chantrey has given to Lord Byron."
"葛朗台老头不理会大家，或者更确切地说，他全神贯注看信的情形，没有逃过公证人和庭长的警觉，这个吝啬鬼那几乎不动声色的脸被烛光照得清清楚楚，他们试图通过这张脸猜测信里的内容。他明显在尽力保持平时的镇定，当他读到下面这封要命的信时，事实上，我们是可以想象出这样一个人竭力维持的表情，信上写道——","The inattention of Pere Grandet, or, to speak more truly, the preoccupation of mind into which the reading of the letter had plunged him, did not escape the vigilance of the notary and the president, who tried to guess the contents of the letter by the almost imperceptible motions of the miser’s face, which was then under the full light of the candle.He maintained the habitual calm of his features with evident difficulty; we may, in fact, picture to ourselves the countenance such a man endeavored to preserve as he read the fatal letter which here follows:—"
"我的哥哥——我们有近二十三年没有见面了。最后一次见面是在我的婚礼上，之后我们俩就高高兴兴地分开了。当然，那时我是无法预见到，你有朝一日会成为家里的顶梁柱，你那时就估计到了家业会兴旺。","My Brother,—It is almost twenty-three years since we have seen each other.My marriage was the occasion of our last interview, after which we parted, and both of us were happy.Assuredly I could not then foresee that you would one day be the prop of the family whose prosperity you then predicted."
"当你手握这封信时，我应该已不在人世了。处在我现在的位置，我是无法在破产的耻辱中苟且偷生的。我在深渊边上等到最后一刻，希望能救自己。末日来了，我注定无法逃脱。我的经纪人和我的公证人罗甘双双破产，卷走了我最后的资财，使我一无所有。我欠了将近四百万的债，只有不到百分之二十五的资产可用来偿还，痛苦至极。你们的葡萄收成不错、质量又好，以至于我仓库里的酒价格大跌。三天之后，巴黎人会大声叫喊：","When you hold this letter within your hands I shall be no longer living.In the position I now hold I cannot survive the disgrace of bankruptcy.I have waited on the edge of the gulf until the last moment, hoping to save myself.The end has come, I must sink into it.The double bankruptcies of my broker and of Roguin, my notary, have carried off my last resources and left me nothing.I have the bitterness of owing nearly four millions, with assets not more than twenty-five per cent in value to pay them.The wines in my warehouses suffer from the fall in prices caused by the abundance and quality of your vintage.In three days Paris will cry out: "
"“葛朗台先生是个无赖！”","“Monsieur Grandet was a knave!” "
"而我这个诚实的人，就要躺在声名狼藉的裹尸布中。我毁了我儿子的好名声，我玷污了它，还夺走了他母亲的财产，我全都赔了。他对此还一无所知，——我心爱的不幸的孩子！我们分手时依依不舍。他高高兴兴，全然不知我生命最后的感情都倾注在了那次诀别中。将来有一天他不会诅咒我吧？我的哥哥，我的哥哥！我们孩子的诅咒是可怕的，对我们的咒骂，他们可以求得宽恕，可他们的诅咒却是无法挽回的。葛朗台，你是我的长兄，你应该保护我，帮帮我，别让夏尔在我的坟前说出狠毒的话来！我的哥哥，写这封信时我痛苦万分，即使是用我的血、我的泪写信，我的痛苦也不会有如此之深的，——不会这么痛苦，因为如果是那样，我会哭泣，我会流血，我会死去，我不会再受折磨，可是现在我很痛苦，干瞪着双眼看着死亡临头。","And I, an honest man, shall be lying in my winding-sheet of infamy.I deprive my son of a good name, which I have stained, and the fortune of his mother, which I have lost.He knows nothing of all this,—my unfortunate child whom I idolize!We parted tenderly.He was ignorant, happily, that the last beatings of my heart were spent in that farewell.Will he not some day curse me?My brother, my brother! The curses of our children are horrible; they can appeal against ours, but theirs are irrevocable.Grandet, you are my elder brother, you owe me your protection; act for me so that Charles may cast no bitter words upon my grave!My brother, if I were writing with my blood, with my tears, no greater anguish could I put into this letter,—nor as great, for then I should weep, I should bleed, I should die, I should suffer no more, but now I suffer and look at death with dry eyes."
"从今以后，你就是我儿子的父亲，在他母亲那边，他没有亲人，这你很清楚。为什么当初我就没有考虑社会偏见呢？为什么我要向爱情让步呢？为什么我要娶一个贵族老爷的私生女呢？夏尔没有家了。哦，我不幸的儿子！我的儿子！听着，葛朗台！我求你，不是为了我自己——再说，你的家产可能也不够担负三百万的抵押——而是为了我的儿子！哥哥，想到你时，我是双手合十的，看看这双手吧！葛朗台，我在临死时把我的儿子托付给你，想到你会当他的父亲，面对死亡时，我也不那么痛苦了。我的夏尔，他很爱我，我对他也很疼爱，我从来没有让他伤心过，他也不会诅咒我的。啊，你看！他很温和，像他的母亲，他不会让你伤心的。可怜的孩子！享受惯了荣华富贵，对你我小时候缺衣少穿受的苦，他一无所知。是我让他倾家荡产了！孤苦伶仃！是的，我所有的朋友都会躲着他，是我让他遭受这样的羞辱！我要是有力气能一把把他推到天堂他母亲的身边就好了！疯了！我还是回头说说我的灾难——也是他的灾难。我把他送到你那里，你可以用某种恰当的方式把我的死讯和他未来的命运告诉他。做他的父亲吧，可要做个好父亲啊。不要马上让他脱离他的悠闲生活，那会要了他的命。我要跪下来，求他放弃作为他母亲的继承人对我的财产的所有权利。但是这样的祈求是多余的，他是讲体面的，而且他会觉得不应该和我的债权人站在一起。在适当的时候让他明白这一点，向他说明我给他造成的艰难的生活状况，如果他对我还有一丝温情，以为的名义告诉他，一切还不是完全无法挽回的。是的，工作和劳动曾救了我们两个，它们也会让他挣回来我败掉的家业。如果他听他父亲的话，我要从墓穴里说给他听，他应该远走印度。我的哥哥，夏尔是个正直勇敢的年轻人，给他必要的资金，让他做投机生意，他是宁死也不会赖掉你借给他的资金的。葛朗台！如果你不这样做的话，你会后悔不已的。啊，我的孩子不会从你那里既得不到情义又得不到帮助吧，那我就会祈求上帝来报复你的冷酷无情！","From henceforth you are my son’s father; he has no relations, as you well know, on his mother’s side.Why did I not consider social prejudices?Why did I yield to love?Why did I marry the natural daughter of a great lord?Charles has no family.Oh, my unhappy son! My son!Listen, Grandet!I implore nothing for myself,—besides, your property may not be large enough to carry a mortgage of three millions,—but for my son!Brother, my suppliant hands are clasped as I think of you; behold them!Grandet, I confide my son to you in dying, and I look at the means of death with less pain as I think that you will be to him a father.He loved me well, my Charles; I was good to him, I never thwarted him; he will not curse me.Ah, you see! He is gentle, he is like his mother, he will cause you no grief.Poor boy! Accustomed to all the enjoyments of luxury, he knows nothing of the privations to which you and I were condemned by the poverty of our youth.And I leave him ruined! Alone!Yes, all my friends will avoid him, and it is I who have brought this humiliation upon him!Would that I had the force to send him with one thrust into the heavens to his mother’s side!Madness!I come back to my disaster—to his.I send him to you that you may tell him in some fitting way of my death, of his future fate.Be a father to him, but a good father.Do not tear him all at once from his idle life, it would kill him.I beg him on my knees to renounce all rights that, as his mother’s heir, he may have on my estate.But the prayer is superfluous; he is honorable, and he will feel that he must not appear among my creditors.Bring him to see this at the right time; reveal to him the hard conditions of the life I have made for him: and if he still has tender thoughts of me, tell him in my name that all is not lost for him.Yes, work, labor, which saved us both, may give him back the fortune of which I have deprived him; and if he listens to his father’s voice as it reaches him from the grave, he will go the Indies.My brother, Charles is an upright and courageous young man; give him the wherewithal to make his venture; he will die sooner than not repay you the funds which you may lend him.Grandet! If you will not do this, you will lay up for yourself remorse.Ah, should my child find neither tenderness nor succor in you, I would call down the vengeance of God upon your cruelty!"
"如果当初我能够从残局中抢救出点什么，我就有权给他留下至少他母亲的部分遗产，可是我最后的月开销耗光了一切。对孩子的命运没有把握，我是不愿撒手人寰的，我真想握着你的手来感受一下神圣的誓言，那可能会让我的心感到温暖：可是时间不等我。当夏尔赶赴你那里时，我正着手准备我的财产转让书。我将竭力以条理清晰而诚实的账目来证明，我的灾难既不是因为过失也不是因为欺诈。正是为了我儿子的缘故，我才拼命这样做的。","If I had been able to save something from the wreck, I might have had the right to leave him at least a portion of his mother’s property; but my last monthly payments have absorbed everything.I did not wish to die uncertain of my child’s fate; I hoped to feel a sacred promise in a clasp of your hand which might have warmed my heart: but time fails me.While Charles is journeying to you I shall be preparing my assignment.I shall endeavor to show by the order and good faith of my accounts that my disaster comes neither from a faulty life nor from dishonesty.It is for my son’s sake that I strive to do this."
"再见，我的哥哥！我托付给你这个高洁的监护权，你会接受的，对此我毫不怀疑，愿上帝赐福于你。在那个我们所有人都得去的世界，有一个人将从此永远为你祈祷。当你读到这些话时，我已经在那里了。","Farewell, my brother!May the blessing of God be yours for the generous guardianship I lay upon you, and which, I doubt not, you will accept.A voice will henceforth and forever pray for you in that world where we must all go, and where I am now as you read these lines."
"维克托-安热-纪尧姆·葛朗台","Victor-Ange-Guillaume Grandet."
"“这么说你们在聊天？”葛朗台老头一边说道，一边小心地把信按原来的折痕折好，放进了他的马甲口袋里。他带着一副谦卑怯懦的神情看着自己的侄子，实际上他是在掩饰自己的情绪和种种盘算。“你暖和过来了吗？”他对夏尔说。","“So you are talking?” said Pere Grandet as he carefully folded the letter in its original creases and put it into his waistcoat-pocket.He looked at his nephew with a humble, timid air, beneath which he hid his feelings and his calculations.“Have you warmed yourself?” he said to him."
"“完全暖和过来了，我亲爱的伯父。”","“Thoroughly, my dear uncle.”"
"“哦，那些女人们在哪里？”他伯父说道，已经忘了侄子要睡在家里。这时欧仁妮和葛朗台太太回到了大厅。","“Well, where are the women?” said his uncle, already forgetting that his nephew was to sleep at the house.At this moment Eugenie and Madame Grandet returned."
"“屋子准备好了吗？”葛朗台恢复了镇定，说道。","“Is the room all ready?” said Grandet, recovering his composure."
"“是的，父亲。”","“Yes, father.”"
"“那好，侄儿，如果你累了，娜农会带你去你的房间。那可不是公子哥的房间，但是你要原谅一个穷种葡萄的，一个子都没有剩下过。税款吞光了一切。”","“Well then, my nephew, if you are tired, Nanon shall show you your room.It isn’t a dandy’s room; but you will excuse a poor wine-grower who never has a penny to spare.Taxes swallow up everything.”"
"“我们不想打搅了，葛朗台，”银行家说，“您可能和令侄有话想谈，所以我们要跟你们道晚安了。”","“We do not wish to intrude, Grandet,” said the banker, “you may want to talk to your nephew, and therefore we will bid you good-night.”"
"一听这话，大家都起了身，每个人都按照各自的身份行了告别礼。老公证人走到门口拿了自己的灯笼，又回来把灯笼点着，并提出要陪德格拉桑一家回去。德格拉桑太太没料到中途会出事，晚会竟提前结束了，结果她的佣人还没来。","At these words the assembly rose, and each made a parting bow in keeping with his or her own character.The old notary went to the door to fetch his lantern and came back to light it, offering to accompany the des Grassins on their way.Madame des Grassins had not foreseen the incident which brought the evening prematurely to an end, her servant therefore had not arrived."
"“能赏脸让我搀您吗，夫人？”神父说。","“Will you do me the honor to take my arm, madame?” said the abbe."
"“谢谢，神父先生。可是我儿子会搀我的。”她冷冷地答道。","“Thank you, monsieur l’abbe, but I have my son,” she answered dryly."
"“女士们和我在一起不会受连累的。”神父说。","“Ladies cannot compromise themselves with me,” said the abbe."
"“让克吕绍先生搀着吧。”她丈夫说。","“Take Monsieur Cruchot’s arm,” said her husband."
"神父挽着这位美丽的女士快步走开了，很快就把众人甩得远远的。","The abbe walked off with the pretty lady so quickly that they were soon some distance in advance of the caravan."
"“那是个英俊的年轻人，夫人，”他一边说，一边抓紧了她的胳膊，“酒做好了，葡萄就没用了。咱们都没戏了。我们可能要跟葛朗台小姐说再见了。欧仁妮将会属于那个花花公子。除非这个堂弟爱上了某个巴黎女人，否则令郎阿道夫会有个情敌的，在——”","“That is a good-looking young man, madame,” he said, pressing her arm.“Goodby to the grapes, the vintage is done.It is all over with us.We may as well say adieu to Mademoiselle Grandet.Eugenie will belong to the dandy.Unless this cousin is enamoured of some Parisian woman, your son Adolphe will find another rival in—” "
"“肯定不会的，神父先生。这个年轻人准会看出来，欧仁妮是个小傻瓜——一个姑娘家，一点儿也没有青春活力。今晚您注意看她了没有？她皮肤黄得像个榅桲。”","“Not at all, monsieur l’abbe.This young man cannot fail to see that Eugenie is a little fool,—a girl without the least freshness.Did you notice her tonight?She was as yellow as a quince.”"
"“也许您已经让那个堂弟注意到这一点了吧？”","“Perhaps you made the cousin notice it?”"
"“我可没花那工夫——”","“I did not take the trouble—” "
"“夫人，您可要一直呆在欧仁妮旁边，这样您就根本不用费劲跟那个年轻人说他堂姐的坏话了，他自己会对比的，那——”","“Place yourself always beside Eugenie, madame, and you need never take the trouble to say anything to the young man against his cousin; he will make his own comparisons, which—” "
"“嗯，他已经答应后天和我一起吃晚餐了。”","“Well, he has promised to dine with me the day after tomorrow.”"
"“啊！要是您愿意的话，夫人——”神父说。","“Ah! If you only @would@, madame—” said the abbe."
"“您想让我做什么，神父先生？您是不是打算给我出些坏点子？我活到三十九岁，一直名声清白，感谢上帝！即使是为了莫卧儿大帝的帝国，我现在也不会糟蹋自己的名声的。你和我都已到了这把年纪，我们都知道说话该有分寸。作为一个牧师，您的想法真是有失身份。呸！可称得上《福勃拉斯》了！”","“What is it that you wish me to do, monsieur l’abbe?Do you mean to offer me bad advice?I have not reached the age of thirty-nine, without a stain upon my reputation, thank God! To compromise myself now, even for the empire of the Great Mogul.You and I are of an age when we both know the meaning of words.For an ecclesiastic, you certainly have ideas that are very incongruous.Fie! It is worthy of @Faublas@!”"
"“您读过《福勃拉斯》？”","“You have read @Faublas@?”"
"“没有，神父先生，我是说《危险的关系》。”","“No, monsieur l’abbe; I meant to say the @Liaisons dangereuses@.”"
"“啊！那本书正经多了，”神父笑着说道，“可是您把我看得和当今的年轻人一样坏，我只不过是想——”","“Ah! That book is infinitely more moral,” said the abbe, laughing.“But you make me out as wicked as a young man of the present day; I only meant—” "
"“您敢说您不是想往我的脑袋里灌些坏水吗？这不是明摆的吗？如果这个年轻人——我承认，他是长得非常英俊——想追求我，他就不会想到他的堂姐了。我知道，在巴黎，善良的母亲们会为了孩子的幸福和财产，以这种方式牺牲自己，但是我们是住在外省，神父先生。”","“Do you dare to tell me you were not thinking of putting wicked things into my head?Isn’t it perfectly clear?If this young man—who I admit is very good-looking—were to make love to me, he would not think of his cousin.In Paris, I know, good mothers do devote themselves in this way to the happiness and welfare of their children; but we live in the provinces, monsieur l’abbe.”"
"“是的，夫人。”","“Yes, madame.”"
"“而且，”她继续说道，“哪怕是一个亿，我和阿道夫本人都不愿意以这样的代价去换。”","“And,” she continued, “I do not want, and Adolphe himself would not want, a hundred millions brought at such a price.”"
"“夫人，我没说什么一个亿，那个诱惑可能太大了，我们谁也抵挡不住的。只是，我以为一个正派女人不失体面、毫无恶意地稍稍调调情，倒是无妨，这实际上是她社交责任的一部分，而且——”","“Madame, I said nothing about a hundred millions; that temptation might be too great for either of us to withstand.Only, I do think that an honest woman may permit herself, in all honor, certain harmless little coquetries, which are, in fact, part of her social duty and which—” "
"“您是这样想的？”","“Do you think so?”"
"“夫人，难道我们不应当彼此相处得愉快些吗？——请允许我擤一下鼻子。——我向您保证，夫人，”他接着说，“那个年轻的绅士拿着眼镜瞟您时的神态，比看我时的神态要谄媚得多，不过，我原谅他爱美胜于敬老——”","“Are we not bound, madame, to make ourselves agreeable to each other?—Permit me to blow my nose.—I assure you, madame,” he resumed, “that the young gentleman ogled you through his glass in a more flattering manner than he put on when he looked at me; but I forgive him for doing homage to beauty in preference to old age—” "
"“很明显，”庭长大声说道，“巴黎的葛朗台先生派他儿子来索米尔，绝对是出于结婚的打算。”","“It is quite apparent,” said the president in his loud voice, “that Monsieur Grandet of Paris has sent his son to Saumur with extremely matrimonial intentions.”"
"“但要是那样的话，那位堂弟不会像炮弹一样突然降临到我们中间的。”公证人答道。","“But in that case the cousin wouldn’t have fallen among us like a cannon-ball,” answered the notary."
"“那说明不了什么，”德格拉桑先生说，“那个老守财奴总是神神秘秘的。”","“That doesn’t prove anything,” said Monsieur des Grassins, “the old miser is always making mysteries.”"
"“德格拉桑，我的朋友，我已经邀请那个年轻人来吃晚餐了。你得去请上德拉索尼埃夫妇和杜奥图瓦一家，当然还有那位漂亮的杜奥图瓦小姐。我希望她会穿得体面一些，她那个母亲嫉妒心很强，总是把她打扮成一个丑八怪！先生们，我希望你们都能赏光光临。”她停下脚步，对两位克吕绍补充道。","“Des Grassins, my friend, I have invited the young man to dinner.You must go and ask Monsieur and Madame de Larsonniere and the du Hautoys, with the beautiful demoiselle du Hautoy, of course.I hope she will be properly dressed; that jealous mother of hers does make such a fright of her!Gentlemen, I trust that you will all do us the honor to come,” she added, stopping the procession to address the two Cruchots."
"“你们到家了，夫人。”公证人说。","“Here you are at home, madame,” said the notary."
"向三位德格拉桑躬身道别后，三位克吕绍便回家了，他们拿出外省人善于分析的天赋，对这一晚的重大事件从各个方面进行了研究，这一事件无疑改变了格拉桑派和克吕绍派各自的立场。这些伟大的阴谋家做任何事情都有着绝好的判断力，双方都觉得有必要暂时结盟以对付共同的敌人。难道他们不应该联手阻止欧仁妮爱上她的堂弟，并阻止这位堂弟想着欧仁妮吗？那个巴黎人能否抵挡得住含沙射影的恶毒语言、花言巧语的诬陷中伤、貌似恭维的诽谤，以及假装天真的拒绝？这些招数会不断地将他包围，让他上当。","After bowing to the three des Grassins, the three Cruchots returned home, applying their provincial genius for analysis to studying, under all its aspects, the great event of the evening, which undoubtedly changed the respective positions of Grassinists and Cruchotines.The admirable common-sense which guided all the actions of these great machinators made each side feel the necessity of a momentary alliance against a common enemy.Must they not mutually hinder Eugenie from loving her cousin, and the cousin from thinking of Eugenie?Could the Parisian resist the influence of treacherous insinuations, soft-spoken calumnies, slanders full of faint praise and artless denials, which should be made to circle incessantly about him and deceive him?"
"第四章","Chapter IV "
"当只剩下他们四个人时，葛朗台先生对他侄子说：“我们该睡觉了。今天太晚了，关于你为什么来这里的事情就不谈了，明天我们再挑个合适的时间。我们八点吃早饭；中午我们吃点儿水果或者吃一点儿面包，喝杯白葡萄酒；我们跟巴黎人一样，五点吃晚饭。这就是一天的安排。如果你想去城里和郊区看看，尽管自便。我事情多，不能陪着你，请原谅。你也许会听到人们说我有钱——葛朗台先生这样呀，葛朗台先生那样呀。我让他们说去，他们的流言蜚语损害不了我的信誉。可是我一个子也没有，我这把年纪还像学徒一样地干活，全部家当就是一把破刨子和两只结实的胳膊。也许，等你不得不自己拼命挣钱的时候，你很快就会明白，挣一个法郎有多辛苦。娜农，蜡烛在哪里？”","When the four relations were left alone, Monsieur Grandet said to his nephew,“We must go to bed.It is too late to talk about the matters which have brought you here; tomorrow we will take a suitable moment.We breakfast at eight o’clock; at midday we eat a little fruit or a bit of bread, and drink a glass of white wine; and we dine, like the Parisians, at five o’clock.That’s the order of the day.If you like to go and see the town and the environs you are free to do so.You will excuse me if my occupations do not permit me to accompany you.You may perhaps hear people say that I am rich,—Monsieur Grandet this, Monsieur Grandet that.I let them talk; their gossip does not hurt my credit.But I have not a penny; I work in my old age like an apprentice whose worldly goods are a bad plane and two good arms.Perhaps you’ll soon know yourself what a franc costs when you have got to sweat for it.Nanon, where are the candles?”"
"“我的侄儿，我相信你需要的东西都备好了，”葛朗台太太说，“不过要是你还需要什么其他的东西，可以喊娜农。”","“I trust, my nephew, that you will find all you want,” said Madame Grandet, “but if you should need anything else, you can call Nanon.”"
"“亲爱的伯母，我不会缺什么的；我想，所有的必需品我都带来了。请允许我向您和我年轻的堂姐道声晚安。”","“My dear aunt, I shall need nothing; I have, I believe, brought everything with me.Permit me to bid you good-night, and my young cousin also.”"
"夏尔从娜农手里接过一支点燃的白蜡烛——一支安茹蜡烛，颜色很黄，因为很陈旧了，所以看上去像油蜡烛似的，而且竟然骗过了葛朗台先生，他根本不会想到在自己的家里会有白蜡烛出现，也就没有发觉这是一件奢侈品。","Charles took a lighted wax candle from Nanon’s hand,—an Anjou candle, very yellow in color, and so shopworn that it looked like tallow and deceived Monsieur Grandet, who, incapable of suspecting its presence under his roof, did not perceive this magnificence."
"“我来给你带路。”他说。","“I will show you the way,” he said."
"葛朗台没有从拱顶下的那个门出大厅，而是郑重其事地从大厅和厨房中间的过道走了过去。一扇镶着一块椭圆形大玻璃的弹簧门隔开了这个过道和楼梯，这样就挡住了从过道穿过的冷风。可是在冬天，北风依旧呼啸凛冽，而且，尽管起居室的门底包有沙袋，屋内仍然很难保持适宜的温度。娜农去把外面的大门闩上，然后关好大厅门，放出了狼狗，那狼狗的吠声嘶哑得像得了咽喉炎一样。这畜生因凶猛而出名，它只认娜农一个人；这两个小家伙都来自野外，没有受过教化，彼此倒是很相投。","Instead of leaving the hall by the door which opened under the archway, Grandet ceremoniously went through the passage which divided the hall from the kitchen.A swing-door, furnished with a large oval pane of glass, shut this passage from the staircase, so as to fend off the cold air which rushed through it.But the north wind whistled none the less keenly in winter, and, in spite of the sand-bags at the bottom of the doors of the living-room, the temperature within could scarcely be kept at a proper height.Nanon went to bolt the outer door; then she closed the hall and let loose a wolf-dog, whose bark was so strangled that he seemed to have laryngitis.This animal, noted for his ferocity, recognized no one but Nanon; the two untutored children of the fields understood each other."
"当夏尔看见楼梯间的墙壁颜色发黄、烟熏斑斑，被虫蛀了的每级台阶在他伯父沉重的脚步下不停地颤抖时，他渐渐从美梦中清醒过来。他觉得自己简直进了一个鸡笼。他转身探询地望了一眼他的伯母和堂姐，她们早已习惯了这种楼梯，所以猜不到他惊讶的原因，还以为他那一眼是表示友好，于是便报以微笑，这令他大失所望。","When Charles saw the yellow, smoke-stained walls of the well of the staircase, where each worm-eaten step shook under the heavy foot-fall of his uncle, his expectations began to sober more and more.He fancied himself in a hen-roost.His aunt and cousin, to whom he turned an inquiring look, were so used to the staircase that they did not guess the cause of his amazement, and took the glance for an expression of friendliness, which they answered by a smile that made him desperate."
"“我父亲为什么把我打发到这个鬼地方来了？”他心想。","“Why the devil did my father send me to such a place?” he said to himself."
"当他们到了第一个楼梯口时，他看见了三扇漆着伊特鲁里亚红色的门，没有门框——门嵌在布满灰尘的墙里，装着铁条，实际上就是门闩，铁条两端有火焰式图案，跟长长的锁眼两头的花纹一样。在楼梯上面的第一个门显然已经给堵死了，门里的房间正好在厨房的上面。实际上，这个房间是他的办公室，只能从葛朗台的卧室进去。唯一采光的窗子临着院子，装有结实的铁条栅格。任何人都不准入内，甚至包括葛朗台太太。老头愿意独自呆在里面，就像一个炼金术师呆在他的实验室里一样。毫无疑问，这里已巧妙地建好了某个暗室，里面藏着地契、房契等，挂着称金路易的天平。夜里，他会偷偷在里面作估算、算利润、开收据，以致生意人看到葛朗台样样都有准备，便猜想他是从鬼神那里得到了启示。无疑，当娜农如雷的鼾声震动着楼板时，当狼狗看护着院子并哈欠连连时，当葛朗台太太和小姐正静悄悄地进入梦乡时，老箍桶匠就来到这里，把他的金子搂住，把玩着、爱抚着、死死抓着、攥着不放。","When they reached the first landing he saw three doors painted in Etruscan red and without casings,—doors sunk in the dusty walls and provided with iron bars, which in fact were bolts, each ending with the pattern of a flame, as did both ends of the long sheath of the lock.The first door at the top of the staircase, which opened into a room directly above the kitchen, was evidently walled up.In fact, the only entrance to that room was through Grandet’s bedchamber; the room itself was his office.The single window which lighted it, on the side of the court, was protected by a lattice of strong iron bars.No one, not even Madame Grandet, had permission to enter it.The old man chose to be alone, like an alchemist in his laboratory.There, no doubt, some hiding-place had been ingeniously constructed; there the title-deeds of property were stored; there hung the scales on which to weigh the louis; there were devised, by night and secretly, the estimates, the profits, the receipts, so that business men, finding Grandet prepared at all points, imagined that he got his cue from fairies or demons; there, no doubt, while Nanon’s loud snoring shook the rafters, while the wolf-dog watched and yawned in the courtyard, while Madame and Mademoiselle Grandet were quietly sleeping, came the old cooper to cuddle, to con over, to caress and clutch and clasp his gold."
"墙壁厚实，护窗也很牢固。只有他一个人有这个实验室的钥匙，据人们说，他在那里研究那些标明了他的果树的图纸，核算他的利润，精确到每株葡萄藤，直至差不多精确到每个小细枝。","The walls were thick, the screens sure.He alone had the key of this laboratory, where—so people declared—he studied the maps on which his fruit-trees were marked, and calculated his profits to a vine, and almost to a twig."
"欧仁妮卧室的门正对着这间屋子封死的入口。楼梯口的另一头是老夫妇俩的卧室，占了整栋宅子的前半部分。葛朗台太太有一个房间紧邻欧仁妮的卧室，可以穿过一扇玻璃门进去。男主人的卧室和他妻子的卧室由隔板隔开，和那个神秘的密室则隔着一道厚实的墙。葛朗台老头将侄儿安排在三楼那个有高高的复折式房顶的阁楼里，就在他自己卧室的上面，这样，如果那个年轻人突然想在房内来回走动的话，他就可以听得见。当欧仁妮和母亲走到楼梯口中间时，她们相互吻别，道了晚安，又跟夏尔说了几句道别的话，然后就回了各自的卧室，那姑娘嘴上冷淡，但心里当然非常热乎。","The door of Eugenie’s chamber was opposite to the walled-up entrance to this room.At the other end of the landing were the appartements of the married pair, which occupied the whole front of the house.Madame Grandet had a room next to that of Eugenie, which was entered through a glass door.The master’s chamber was separated from that of his wife by a partition, and from the mysterious strong-room by a thick wall.Pere Grandet lodged his nephew on the second floor, in the high mansard attic which was above his own bedroom, so that he might hear him if the young man took it into his head to go and come.When Eugenie and her mother reached the middle of the landing they kissed each other for good-night; then with a few words of adieu to Charles, cold upon the lips, but certainly very warm in the heart of the young girl, they withdrew into their own chambers."
"“这就是你的房间，侄儿，”葛朗台老头一边开门，一边说道，“如果你要出去，就喊娜农；要是没有她，可要当心！那狗会一声不响地吃了你。睡个好觉。晚安。哈！啊呀，她们给你生了火！”他叫道。","“Here you are in your room, my nephew,” said Pere Grandet as he opened the door.“If you need to go out, call Nanon; without her, beware! The dog would eat you up without a word.Sleep well.Good night.Ha! Why, they have made you a fire!” he cried."
"这时娜农拿着暖床炉出现了。","At this moment Nanon appeared with the warming pan."
"“还有一个东西啊！”葛朗台先生说，“你把我侄儿当成个产妇吗？拿走你的火盆，娜农！”","“Here’s something more!” said Monsieur Grandet.“Do you take my nephew for a lying-in woman?Carry off your brazier, Nanon!”"
"“可是，先生，床单潮着呢，而且这位先生和一个女人一样娇嫩。”","“But, monsieur, the sheets are damp, and this gentleman is as delicate as a woman.”"
"“好吧，得啦，既然你决定这么做，”葛朗台说着，推了推她的肩膀，“不过，别把东西给烧着了。”说着，守财奴下了楼，嘴里嘟嘟囔囔的，不知说了些什么。","“Well, go on, as you’ve taken it into your head,” said Grandet, pushing her by the shoulders, “but don’t set things on fire.”So saying, the miser went downstairs, grumbling indistinct sentences."
"夏尔站在他的行李堆中间发愣。阁楼墙上的壁纸，黄底上零星点缀着花丛，花丛是是舞会上常用的那种；石砌的壁炉有凸起的条纹，那样子看着让人心凉；黄木椅子铺着漆过清漆的草垫，看起来似乎不止常见的四个角；开着的床头柜，大得可以容下一个小个子的警卫官；床边是破旧的脚毯，床天盖的布帷幔摇摇晃晃，仿佛被虫咬得都快要掉下来了。他一件件打量完之后，一本正经地转向大个子娜农，说道——","Charles stood aghast in the midst of his trunks.After casting his eyes on the attic-walls covered with that yellow paper sprinkled with bouquets so well known in dance-houses, on the fireplace of ribbed stone whose very look was chilling, on the chairs of yellow wood with varnished cane seats that seemed to have more than the usual four angles, on the open night-table capacious enough to hold a small sergeant-at-arms, on the meagre bit of rag-carpet beside the bed, on the tester whose cloth valance shook as if, devoured by moths, it was about to fall, he turned gravely to la Grande Nanon and said,—"
"“喂！我亲爱的女士，告诉我，我真是在葛朗台先生——前索米尔市长，巴黎葛朗台先生的哥哥——的府上吗？”","“Look here! My dear woman, just tell me, am I in the house of Monsieur Grandet, formerly mayor of Saumur, and brother to Monsieur Grandet of Paris?”"
"“是的，先生，一个非常好、非常仁慈、非常完美的绅士。要我帮您打开行李吗？”","“Yes, monsieur; and a very good, a very kind, a very perfect gentleman.Shall I help you to unpack your trunks?”"
"“好啊！要的，如果你愿意的话，我的兵大爷。你没在帝国近卫团里当过水兵吗？”","“Faith! Yes, if you will, my old trooper.Didn’t you serve in the marines of the Imperial Guard?”"
"“呵，呵，呵！”娜农大笑着，“那是什么呀——近卫团水兵？是咸的吗？在水里游的？”","“Ho, ho, ho!” laughed Nanon.“What’s that,—the marines of the guard?Is it salt?Does it go in the water?”"
"“喂，从那个提箱里给我拿一下我的睡衣，给你钥匙。”","“Here, get me my dressing-gown out of that valise; there’s the key.”"
"当看到一件金线绣花、古式图案的绿绸睡衣时，娜农惊呆了。","Nanon was wonder-struck by the sight of a dressing-gown made of green silk, brocaded with gold flowers of an antique design."
"“您要穿这个睡觉？”她问道。","“Are you going to put that on to go to bed with?” she asked."
"“是啊。”","“Yes.”"
"“圣母玛利亚！给教区教堂当祭坛的桌布才叫好看呢！我亲爱的先生，把它捐给教堂吧，那样您会拯救您的灵魂的，不然，您就会失去灵魂。哦，您穿着可真好看呀！我得叫小姐来看看您。”","“Holy Virgin! What a beautiful altar-cloth it would make for the parish church!My dear darling monsieur, give it to the church, and you’ll save your soul; if you don’t, you’ll lose it.Oh, how nice you look in it!I must call mademoiselle to see you.”"
"“得啦，娜农，如果你是娜农，就闭上你的嘴，让我睡觉去。明天我再收拾我的东西。要是你那么喜欢我的睡衣，你就拯救你的灵魂去吧。我是个虔诚的基督徒，走的时候会把它送给你，你爱怎么处理就随便你。”","“Come, Nanon, if Nanon you are, hold your tongue; let me go to bed.I’ll arrange my things tomorrow.If my dressing-gown pleases you so much, you shall save your soul.I’m too good a Christian not to give it to you when I go away, and you can do what you like with it.”"
"娜农一动不动地站着，呆呆地看着夏尔，不敢相信他的话。","Nanon stood rooted to the ground, gazing at Charles and unable to put faith into his words."
"“晚安，娜农。”","“Good night, Nanon.”"
"“我干嘛要来这里？”夏尔睡觉时，心里想着，“我父亲不是个傻子，让我来一定有目的。哼！不知哪个希腊白痴说的，等明天再说正经事。”","“What in the world have I come here for?” thought Charles as he went to sleep.“My father is not a fool; my journey must have some object.Pshaw! Put off serious thought till the morrow, as some Greek idiot said.”"
"“圣母玛利亚！我的堂弟，他可真迷人！”欧仁妮说着，停下了祈祷。那天晚上她的祈祷就没有做完。","“Blessed Virgin! How charming he is, my cousin!”Eugenie was saying, interrupting her prayers, which that night at least were never finished."
"葛朗台太太上床睡觉时，什么也没想。从隔板中间的通门，她听见了守财奴在他的房间里走来走去的声音。像所有胆小的女人一样，她早摸透了她主人的脾气。如同海燕能预见暴风雨，她也能从微妙莫测的迹象中，知道丈夫的心里正在翻腾着狂风暴雨。在这种时候，用她自己的话说，她就“装死”。","Madame Grandet had no thoughts at all as she went to bed.She heard the miser walking up and down his room through the door of communication which was in the middle of the partition.Like all timid women, she had studied the character of her lord.Just as the petrel foresees the storm, she knew by imperceptible signs when an inward tempest shook her husband; and at such times, to use an expression of her own, she “feigned dead.”"
"葛朗台最近刚给那扇门钉上了铁皮，他一边瞪着门，一边自言自语道——　","Grandet gazed at the door lined with sheet-iron which he lately put to his sanctum, and said to himself,—"
"“真是疯了，我兄弟竟想把他的儿子遗留给我！好大一笔遗产！我可没有五十法郎给他。五十法郎对一个花花公子来说有什么用，他看着我的晴雨表，就好像打算拿它当柴火烧呢！”","“What a crazy idea of my brother to bequeath his son to me!A fine legacy!I have not fifty francs to give him.What are fifty francs to a dandy who looked at my barometer as if he meant to make firewood of it!”"
"想着那份痛苦的遗嘱会带来的后果，葛朗台的心绪可能比他兄弟写遗嘱的时候还要乱。","In thinking over the consequences of that legacy of anguish Grandet was perhaps more agitated than his brother had been at the moment of writing it."
"“我要得到那件金袍子啦。”娜农想着，睡着了，在梦中穿上了她的祭坛布，平生第一次梦见了花、刺绣和锦缎，就像欧仁妮正平生第一次梦见爱情一样。","“I shall have that golden robe,” thought Nanon, who went to sleep tricked out in her altar-cloth, dreaming for the first time in her life of flowers, embroidery, and damask, just as Eugenie was dreaming of love."
"在少女们纯洁而单调的生活中，必有一个美妙的时刻，阳光会照进她们的灵魂，鲜花会表达她们的思想，心的跳动会把热烈的生机传递到她们的脑海，并把所有意念融化为一种朦胧的渴望——一段充满了天真无邪的忧郁和美妙快乐的时光！当婴儿开始看世界时，他们露出了微笑；当一个少女第一次感觉到大自然的这种情愫时，她也发出了儿时般的微笑。如果光明是生命的初恋，那爱情不就是心灵的光明吗？欧仁妮看清尘世万物的时刻已经来到了。","In the pure and monotonous life of young girls there comes a delicious hour when the sun sheds its rays into their soul, when the flowers express their thoughts, when the throbbings of the heart send upward to the brain their fertilizing warmth and melt all thoughts into a vague desire,—day of innocent melancholy and of dulcet joys!When babes begin to see, they smile; when a young girl first perceives the sentiment of nature, she smiles as she smiled when an infant.If light is the first love of life, is not love a light to the heart?The moment to see within the veil of earthly things had come for Eugenie."
"像所有外省姑娘一样，她是个习惯早起的人，她早早起来，做了祷告，然后开始梳洗打扮——这是一件从今以后颇有意义的事情。她先把她那栗色的头发梳得光光的，然后仔仔细细地把粗大的辫子盘到头顶，不让散发掉出来，并使发式对称，这愈发烘托出她一脸的娇羞和纯真来，头饰的简洁与她面部线条的朴实配合得恰到好处。她一遍又一遍地在冷水中洗着她的手，那冷水使她的皮肤粗糙发红，她看着自己漂亮圆润的胳膊，心里纳闷，她的堂弟是怎么把他的双手弄得那么柔软洁白，怎么把指甲修剪得那么精致。　她穿上了新长筒袜和她最漂亮的鞋子。她把紧身胸衣束好，没有漏过一个扣眼。她生平第一次希望自己显得漂亮，她体会到了一件裁剪合身、使她亮丽迷人的新裙子所带来的乐趣。","An early riser, like all provincial girls, she was up betimes and said her prayers, and then began the business of dressing,—a business which henceforth was to have a meaning.First she brushed and smoothed her chestnut hair and twisted its heavy masses to the top of her head with the utmost care, preventing the loose tresses from straying, and giving to her head a symmetry which heightened the timid candor of her face; for the simplicity of these accessories accorded well with the innocent sincerity of its lines.As she washed her hands again and again in the cold water which hardened and reddened the skin, she looked at her handsome round arms and asked herself what her cousin did to make his hands so softly white, his nails so delicately curved.She put on new stockings and her prettiest shoes.She laced her corset straight, without skipping a single eyelet.And then, wishing for the first time in her life to appear to advantage, she felt the joy of having a new gown, well made, which rendered her attractive."
"等她梳妆完毕，教区教堂的钟敲响报时了，令她惊讶的是，只敲了七下。她起得实在太早了，因为一心想有足够的时间来精心打扮。欧仁妮不懂得每个发卷可以反复整理并研究每种效果，她只是交叉着手臂，坐在窗前，看着院子、窄小的花园和花园上高高的梯状档土墙：一派视野封闭的凄凉景色，但也不无那种偏僻、荒芜之处所特有的神秘之美。厨房旁边是口井，周围有井栏，轱辘拴在一个弯曲的铁杆上，上面缠着一根葡萄藤，葡萄藤的枝叶在这个季节已干枯，发红，并枯萎掉了。弯弯曲曲的藤蔓从这里爬上了墙，攀附而上，顺着整幢屋子一直爬到了柴堆附近，柴堆的干柴放得像图书馆的书一样整整齐齐。院子的路面长着苔藓和杂草，而且无人走动，时间长了，路面就显得黑迹斑斑了。厚厚的围墙披着一层青苔，夹杂着波浪状的褐色枝条，院子尽头的八级石台阶通向花园门口，已残缺不全，掩埋于高大的植物之下，好似十字军时代一个寡妇埋葬骑士丈夫的坟茔。在长满苔藓、日渐碎裂的石基上是一排腐烂的木栅，因腐朽已坍塌了一半，上面乱七八糟地攀附缠绕着成簇的藤萝。栅门两边，两株矮小的苹果树伸出了弯曲的枝丫。花园里有三条并排的小路，铺着砾石，中间隔有方形花坛，周围种着黄杨，以防泥土流失，在花园尽头、老墙平台的下面是一片椴树。更远处的一头是树莓灌木丛，而靠近屋子的另一头，有一株高大的胡桃树，树枝几乎垂进了守财奴密室的窗子里。","As she finished her toilet the clock of the parish church struck the hour; to her astonishment, it was only seven.The desire of having plenty of time for dressing carefully had led her to get up too early.Ignorant of the art of retouching every curl and studying every effect, Eugenie simply crossed her arms, sat down by the window, and looked at the courtyard, the narrow garden, and the high terraced walls that over-topped it: a dismal, hedged-in prospect, yet not wholly devoid of those mysterious beauties which belong to solitary or uncultivated nature.Near the kitchen was a well surrounded by a curb, with a pulley fastened to a bent iron rod clasped by a vine whose leaves were withered, reddened, and shrivelled by the season.From thence the tortuous shoots straggled to the wall, clutched it, and ran the whole length of the house, ending near the wood-pile, where the logs were ranged with as much precision as the books in a library.The pavement of the courtyard showed the black stains produced in time by lichens, herbage, and the absence of all movement or friction.The thick walls wore a coating of green moss streaked with waving brown lines, and the eight stone steps at the bottom of the courtyard which led up to the gate of the garden were disjointed and hidden beneath tall plants, like the tomb of a knight buried by his widow in the days of the Crusades.Above a foundation of moss-grown, crumbling stones was a trellis of rotten wood, half fallen from decay; over them clambered and intertwined at will a mass of clustering creepers.On each side of the latticed gate stretched the crooked arms of two stunted apple-trees.Three parallel walks, gravelled and separated from each other by square beds, where the earth was held in by box-borders, made the garden, which terminated, beneath a terrace of the old walls, in a group of lindens.At the farther end were raspberry-bushes; at the other, near the house, an immense walnut-tree drooped its branches almost into the window of the miser’s sanctum."
"夜间这些美丽的景物上、墙垣上和满院子的植物上都凝结上了白霜，由于天气晴朗，再加上卢瓦尔河畔的秋天常常阳光灿烂，那些白霜正开始融化。从这些不久前还觉得平淡无奇的景物中，欧仁妮发现了一种新的魅力。随着阳光在墙外渐渐照射开去，她的脑海中涌起了万千纷杂的思绪，越想越多。她感到一阵模糊而无法言说的愉悦感把精神包裹住了，就像云雾把物体包裹住一样。她的思绪与这奇特风景的点点滴滴相投相契，心中的和谐与自然界的和谐融成一片。在一个墙角，原产于南方地区的凤尾草垂下浓密的枝叶，闪动着鸽颈般千变万化的颜色，当阳光照到这里时，希望的天光便照亮了她眼中的未来。从此，她就喜欢盯着这堵墙看，看墙上苍白的花朵、蓝色的风信子和枯草，那其中交织着她的回忆，像童年的往事一样甜蜜。","A clear day and the beautiful autumnal sun common to the banks of the Loire was beginning to melt the hoar-frost which the night had laid on these picturesque objects, on the walls, and on the plants which swathed the courtyard.Eugenie found a novel charm in the aspect of things lately so insignificant to her.A thousand confused thoughts came to birth in her mind and grew there, as the sunbeams grew without along the wall.She felt that impulse of delight, vague, inexplicable, which wraps the moral being as a cloud wraps the physical body.Her thoughts were all in keeping with the details of this strange landscape, and the harmonies of her heart blended with the harmonies of nature.When the sun reached an angle of the wall where the “Venus-hair” of southern climes drooped its thick leaves, lit with the changing colors of a pigeon’s breast, celestial rays of hope illumined the future to her eyes, and thenceforth she loved to gaze upon that piece of wall, on its pale flowers, its blue harebells, its wilting herbage, with which she mingled memories as tender as those of childhood."
"在这个有回声的院子里，每一片叶子从树枝上掉下时所发出的声响，都是在回答少女秘密的问询，她会整天呆在那里，感觉不到时光的飞逝。接着，她心里出现了一阵骚动不安。她不时地站起来，走到镜子前，看着自己，仿佛有良知的作家在审视自己的作品一样，内心批评着和责备着他自己的作品。","The noise made by each leaf as it fell from its twig in the void of that echoing court gave answer to the secret questionings of the young girl, who could have stayed there the livelong day without perceiving the flight of time.Then came tumultuous heavings of the soul.She rose often, went to her glass, and looked at herself, as an author in good faith looks at his work to criticise it and blame it in his own mind."
"“我不够漂亮，配不上他！”这就是欧仁妮的想法——一种自卑的念头，充满了痛苦。这可怜的姑娘对自己太不公平了，但是谦虚，说得更确切点，畏惧，可谓爱情的首要美德。欧仁妮属于那种身体结实的孩子，正如我们看到的阶层较低的资产阶级那样，他们的美似乎总是有点俗气。然而，尽管她的相貌像米洛岛的维纳斯，但她的形态却因基督徒更温婉的气质而显得高贵，让她女性的气质纯洁、脱俗，这种特性是古代的雕刻家们没有见识过的。她的头很大，额头像菲迪亚斯的丘比特雕像，有点男子气，却也清秀，灰色的眼睛炯炯有神，充分显示了她贞洁的生活。她的圆脸原本娇嫩红润，因天花而一度肿胀，尽管有幸没有留下痘瘢，却毁掉了皮肤天鹅绒般的质感。不过她的脸颊仍旧那么柔软细嫩，以致她母亲的亲吻都会在上面暂时留下红印。她的鼻子有点大，但同那朱红的嘴唇倒很相配，满是细纹的双唇充满着深情和善意。她的脖子是滚圆的。她胸部的曲线非常优美，遮得严严实实，却引人注目，令人想入非非。毫无疑问，它缺乏得体的服饰所能带来的那种优雅，但是在行家眼里，她刻板的身材自有其魅力。欧仁妮高大健壮，不具备一般人所喜欢的那种漂亮，可是她的美是一望而知的，只有艺术家才会真正为之倾倒。一个画家想在尘世寻找圣母玛利亚那样圣洁的典型，要找到拉斐尔描摹的女性那种不卑不亢的眼神，以及那种虽然往往出自构思的巧合，但却只有基督徒清心寡欲的生活才能培养或保持的处女的线条——这样一个醉心于完美理想的画家，会在欧仁妮的脸上发现那种连她本人都未曾发觉的天生的高贵；他会在那平静的眉宇之下看到一个爱情的世界；他会感觉到，在那眼睛的形状里，在那眼睑的低垂中，有着某种难以名状的东西，我们将其称之为神圣。","“I am not beautiful enough for him!”Such was Eugenie’s thought,—a humble thought, fertile in suffering.The poor girl did not do herself justice; but modesty, or rather fear, is among the first of love’s virtues.Eugenie belonged to the type of children with sturdy constitutions, such as we see among the lesser bourgeoisie, whose beauties always seem a little vulgar; and yet, though she resembled the Venus of Milo, the lines of her figure were ennobled by the softer Christian sentiment which purifies womanhood and gives it a distinction unknown to the sculptors of antiquity.She had an enormous head, with the masculine yet delicate forehead of the Jupiter of Phidias, and gray eyes, to which her chaste life, penetrating fully into them, carried a flood of light.The features of her round face, formerly fresh and rosy, were at one time swollen by the small-pox, which destroyed the velvet texture of the skin, though it kindly left no other traces, and her cheek was still so soft and delicate that her mother’s kiss made a momentary red mark upon it.Her nose was somewhat too thick, but it harmonized well with the vermilion mouth, whose lips, creased in many lines, were full of love and kindness.The throat was exquisitely round.The bust, well curved and carefully covered, attracted the eye and inspired reverie.It lacked, no doubt, the grace which a fitting dress can bestow; but to a connoisseur the non-flexibility of her figure had its own charm.Eugenie, tall and strongly made, had none of the prettiness which pleases the masses; but she was beautiful with a beauty which the spirit recognizes, and none but artists truly love.A painter seeking here below for a type of Mary’s celestial purity, searching womankind for those proud modest eyes which Raphael divined, for those virgin lines, often due to chances of conception, which the modesty of Christian life alone can bestow or keep unchanged,—such a painter, in love with his ideal, would have found in the face of Eugenie the innate nobleness that is ignorant of itself; he would have seen beneath the calmness of that brow a world of love; he would have felt, in the shape of the eyes, in the fall of the eyelids, the presence of the nameless something that we call divine."
"她脸部的线条、她头部的轮廓，从未因快乐的表情而有所改变或露出倦容，就像平静的湖面在远方的天水相接处留下的线条一样柔和。那恬静而红润的面容，周边绕着光彩，宛若美丽绽放的花朵，使人心旷神怡、百看不厌，散发着精神折射的魅力。欧仁妮正站在人生的岸边，那里幼稚的幻想如花朵般盛开，采集雏菊占卜爱情时的喜悦之情不久将不复拥有。因此，她还不清楚爱情是什么，只是望着镜子里自己的形象，说道：","Her features, the contour of her head, which no expression of pleasure had ever altered or wearied, were like the lines of the horizon softly traced in the far distance across the tranquil lakes.That calm and rosy countenance, margined with light like a lovely full-blown flower, rested the mind, held the eye, and imparted the charm of the conscience that was there reflected.Eugenie was standing on the shore of life where young illusions flower, where daisies are gathered with delights ere long to be unknown; and thus she said, looking at her image in the glass, unconscious as yet of love: "
"“我太丑了，他不会看上我的。”","“I am too ugly; he will not notice me.”"
"随后，她打开正对楼梯间的卧室的门，伸出脖子去听屋子里的动静。她听见了娜农早上的咳嗽声，这个好心人走来走去，打扫大厅，生火，拴狗，跟牛圈里的牲口说话。她心想：“他还没有起床。”欧仁妮立刻下楼，跑去找正在挤奶的娜农。","Then she opened the door of her chamber which led to the staircase, and stretched out her neck to listen for the household noises.“He is not up,” she thought, hearing Nanon’s morning cough as the good soul went and came, sweeping out the halls, lighting her fire, chaining the dog, and speaking to the beasts in the stable.Eugenie at once went down and ran to Nanon, who was milking the cow."
"“娜农，我的好娜农，给我堂弟的早餐弄点奶油吧。”","“Nanon, my good Nanon, make a little cream for my cousin’s breakfast.”"
"“唉，小姐，昨天你就应该想到的，”娜农说着，大声笑了起来，“我可做不出奶油来。你堂弟真可爱，真可爱！哦，他太可爱了！你应该看看他穿着睡衣的样子，全是金线银线！我可是看见他了，真的！他穿的衬衣就跟神父先生的白祭袍一样细洁。”","“Why, mademoiselle, you should have thought of that yesterday,” said Nanon, bursting into a loud peal of laughter.“I can’t make cream.Your cousin is a darling, a darling! Oh, that he is!You should have seen him in his dressing-gown, all silk and gold!I saw him, I did!He wears linen as fine as the surplice of monsieur le cure.”"
"“娜农，请给我们做个烤饼吧。”","“Nanon, please make us a @galette@.”"
"“那谁给我烧炉子的柴火呢，还有做饼子的面粉和黄油？”娜农说道，作为葛朗台家的总管，她有时在欧仁妮和她母亲眼中倒是显得很了不起。“总不成偷老爷的东西来款待你的堂弟吧。你去问他要黄油、面粉，还有木柴：他是你父亲，也许会给你一些的。瞧！他现在正要来分配伙食呢。”","“And who’ll give me wood for the oven, and flour and butter for the cakes?” said Nanon, who in her function of prime-minister to Grandet assumed at times enormous importance in the eyes of Eugenie and her mother.“Mustn’t rob the master to feast the cousin.You ask him for butter and flour and wood: he’s your father, perhaps he’ll give you some.See! There he is now, coming to give out the provisions.”"
"听见楼梯在父亲的脚步下发出了颤动声，欧仁妮吓坏了，逃进了花园。幸福时，我们会以为——也许不无道理——我们的心思全刻在脑门上，所有人都能一眼看穿，这种处女纯洁的羞怯与特别的感觉产生的作用，欧仁妮已经体会到了。这可怜的姑娘第一次发觉到父亲的屋子太寒酸了，配不上堂弟的高雅，便觉得有些气恼。她觉得有必要为他做点什么——什么呢，她也不知道。她既天真又诚实，听凭自己纯洁的天性尽情发挥，而毫不怀疑她自己的印象或是感觉。一看见堂弟，女性那种自然的渴望就在她心中被唤醒了——那渴望可能会越来越强烈，因为她毕竟已经二十三岁了，正处于智力和欲望的高峰期。　她生平第一次在见到父亲时心里充满了恐惧感，从他身上，她明白了他是她命运的主人，她认为对他隐瞒某些心事是种罪过。她迈着急促的步子走着，很奇怪呼吸到的空气比平时更新鲜，感觉阳光使她的脉搏加速了，她从这暖意中吸取了一种精神上的温暖和一种新的生机。当她正盘算着用什么计策弄到饼子时，大个子娜农和葛朗台吵了起来——这种事跟冬天看见燕子一样稀罕。这位男主人拿着钥匙，来分配当天消费所需的食物。","Eugenie escaped into the garden, quite frightened as she heard the staircase shaking under her father’s step.Already she felt the effects of that virgin modesty and that special consciousness of happiness which lead us to fancy, not perhaps without reason, that our thoughts are graven on our foreheads and are open to the eyes of all.Perceiving for the first time the cold nakedness of her father’s house, the poor girl felt a sort of rage that she could not put it in harmony with her cousin’s elegance.She felt the need of doing something for him,—what, she did not know.Ingenuous and truthful, she followed her angelic nature without mistrusting her impressions or her feelings.The mere sight of her cousin had wakened within her the natural yearnings of a woman,—yearnings that were the more likely to develop ardently because, having reached her twenty-third year, she was in the plenitude of her intelligence and her desires.For the first time in her life her heart was full of terror at the sight of her father; in him she saw the master of the fate, and she fancied herself guilty of wrong-doing in hiding from his knowledge certain thoughts.She walked with hasty steps, surprised to breathe a purer air, to feel the sun’s rays quickening her pulses, to absorb from their heat a moral warmth and a new life.As she turned over in her mind some stratagem by which to get the cake, a quarrel—an event as rare as the sight of swallows in winter—broke out between la Grande Nanon and Grandet.Armed with his keys, the master had come to dole out provisions for the day’s consumption."
"“有没有昨天剩的面包？”他对娜农说。","“Is there any bread left from yesterday?” he said to Nanon."
"“连个渣都没有，先生。”","“Not a crumb, monsieur.”"
"葛朗台拿出一个大圆面包，面包撒满干面，放在一个安茹地区烤面包常用的平底篮里，他正要去切时，娜农对他说——　","Grandet took a large round loaf, well floured and moulded in one of the flat baskets which they use for baking in Anjou, and was about to cut it, when Nanon said to him,—"
"“今天咱们是五个人，先生。”","“We are five, today, monsieur.”"
"“没错，”葛朗台说，“可你的面包有六磅重，会有富余的。而且，这些从巴黎来的年轻人不吃面包，你等着瞧吧。”","“That’s true,” said Grandet, “but your loaves weigh six pounds; there’ll be some left.Besides, these young fellows from Paris don’t eat bread, you’ll see.”"
"“那他们一定吃抹酱了？”娜农说。","“Then they must eat @frippe@?” said Nanon."
"“抹酱”是安茹当地的用词，意思是搭配面包吃的东西，从最普通的抹酱——涂在面包上的黄油，到最高级的抹酱——桃酱，都包括在内。那些小时候舔光抹酱而剩下面包的人会懂得娜农那句话的意思。","@Frippe@ is a word of the local lexicon of Anjou, and means any accompaniment of bread, from butter which is spread upon it, the commonest kind of @frippe@, to peach preserve, the most distinguished of all the @frippes@; those who in their childhood have licked the @frippe@ and left the bread, will comprehend the meaning of Nanon’s speech."
"“不，”葛朗台答道，“他们既不吃面包，也不吃抹酱，他们有点儿像待嫁的姑娘。”","“No,” answered Grandet, “they eat neither bread nor @frippe@; they are something like marriageable girls.”"
"老头像平时一样，非常吝啬地拟定了当天的饭菜，然后锁好装食物的柜子，正要往果园走时，娜农拦住他说——　","After ordering the meals for the day with his usual parsimony, the goodman, having locked the closets containing the supplies, was about to go towards the fruit-garden, when Nanon stopped him to say,—"
"“先生，给我一些面粉和黄油吧，我要给孩子们做个烤饼。”","“Monsieur, give me a little flour and some butter, and I’ll make a @galette@ for the young ones.”"
"“为了我侄儿，你要打劫我们家吗？”","“Are you going to pillage the house on account of my nephew?”"
"“我为您侄儿操的心没有为您的狗操的心多，也不会比您费的心思多。瞧，还不是因为您只给了六块糖。我想要八块。”","“I wasn’t thinking any more of your nephew than I was of your dog,—not more than you think yourself; for, look here, you’ve only forked out six bits of sugar.I want eight.”"
"“这都是怎么啦，娜农？我以前从来没见过你这个样子。你脑子里想什么呢？你是这里的女主人吗？你最多只能要六块糖。”","“What’s all this, Nanon?I have never seen you like this before.What have you got in your head?Are you the mistress here?You sha’n’t have more than six pieces of sugar.”"
"“好吧，那您的侄儿怎么给咖啡放糖？”","“Well, then, how is your nephew to sweeten his coffee?”"
"“放两块，我可以不要。”","“With two pieces; I’ll go without myself.”"
"“您这个年纪不放糖！我宁愿自己掏钱给您买上一点儿。”","“Go without sugar at your age!I’d rather buy you some out of my own pocket.”"
"“少管闲事。”","“Mind your own business.”"
"虽然糖价最近跌了，但在葛朗台眼里，糖仍然是最贵重的殖民地产品，对他来说，糖永远是六法郎一磅。帝政时期不得不节省用糖，这对他来说已成了根深蒂固的习惯。所有女人，即使是最愚蠢的，都知道如何巧用算计来达到她们的目，娜农撇开糖的问题来争取烤饼了。","In spite of the recent fall in prices, sugar was still in Grandet’s eyes the most valuable of all the colonial products; to him it was always six francs a pound.The necessity of economizing it, acquired under the Empire, had grown to be the most inveterate of his habits.All women, even the greatest ninnies, know how to dodge and dodge to get their ends; Nanon abandoned the sugar for the sake of getting the @galette@."
"“小姐！”她隔着窗子喊道，“你想要吃烤饼吗？”","“Mademoiselle!” she called through the window, “do you want some @galette@?”"
"“不，不想。”欧仁妮回答。","“No, no,” answered Eugenie."
"“得啦，娜农，”葛朗台听到女儿的声音，说道，“给你。”他打开放面粉的柜子，给了她一杯面粉，往他已经切好的黄油上又添了几盎司。","“Come, Nanon,” said Grandet, hearing his daughter’s voice.“See here.”He opened the cupboard where the flour was kept, gave her a cupful, and added a few ounces of butter to the piece he had already cut off."
"“我需要柴火烧炉子。”得寸进尺的娜农说道。","“I shall want wood for the oven,” said the implacable Nanon."
"“好吧，你要多少就拿多少，”他伤心地答道，“不过要是那样，你得给我们做个果子馅饼，所有晚饭全都在炉子上做。这下你就不用生两个灶火了。”","“Well, take what you want,” he answered sadly, “but in that case you must make us a fruit-tart, and you’ll cook the whole dinner in the oven.In that way you won’t need two fires.”"
"“天哪！”娜农叫道，“这您不用吩咐。”","“Goodness!” cried Nanon, “you needn’t tell me that.”"
"葛朗台用近乎慈父般的眼神看了他忠实的副手一眼。","Grandet cast a look that was well-nigh paternal upon his faithful deputy."
"“小姐，”等他转过了身，她大声喊道，“我们有烤饼吃了。”","“Mademoiselle,” she cried, when his back was turned, “we shall have the @galette@.”"
"葛朗台老头从园子里拿了水果回来，摆了满满一盘放在厨房的桌子上。","Pere Grandet returned from the garden with the fruit and arranged a plateful on the kitchen-table."
"“瞧瞧，先生，”娜农说，“您侄儿的靴子可真漂亮。多好的皮子！怎么闻起来这么香！我就纳闷了，他用什么擦的呢？我要不要用您的鸡蛋清调的鞋油给擦擦？”","“Just see, monsieur,” said Nanon, “what pretty boots your nephew has.What leather!Why it smells good!What does he clean it with, I wonder?Am I to put your egg-polish on it?”"
"“娜农，我想鸡蛋会弄坏那种皮子的。告诉他，你不知道怎么擦黑摩洛哥羊皮，对，那是摩洛哥羊皮。他自己会到索米尔给你买回能擦亮那双靴子的油。我听说他们往黑色鞋油里掺上糖来叫它发亮。”","“Nanon, I think eggs would injure that kind of leather.Tell him you don’t know how to black morocco; yes, that’s morocco.He will get you something himself in Saumur to polish those boots with.I have heard that they put sugar into the blacking to make it shine.”"
"“它们看上去真好，简直都能吃了，”这厨子把靴子放到她鼻子上，说道，“我的天哪！它们闻起来简直就跟太太的古龙香水一样。哦！太有趣了！”","“They look good to eat,” said the cook, putting the boots to her nose.“Bless me! If they don’t smell like madame’s eau-de-cologne.Ah! How funny!”"
"“有趣！”她的主人说，“花在靴子上的钱比穿靴子的人的身价还要高，你觉得这有趣？”","“Funny!” said her master.“Do you call it funny to put more money into boots than the man who stands in them is worth?”"
"“先生，”等葛朗台锁上果园，再次返回来时，她说，“您不准备每星期做一两次蔬菜牛肉汤来款待款待您的侄子吗？”","“Monsieur,” she said, when Grandet returned the second time, after locking the fruit-garden, “won’t you have the @pot-au-feu@ put on once or twice a week on account of your nephew?”"
"“行。”","“Yes.”"
"“那我就去肉铺了？”","“Am I to go to the butcher’s?”"
"“当然不用。我们要做野鸡汤，佃户们会送来的。我会叫科努瓦耶打几只乌鸦，那东西做汤是最好不过了。”","“Certainly not.We will make the broth of fowls; the farmers will bring them.I shall tell Cornoiller to shoot some crows; they make the best soup in the world.”"
"“真的吗，先生，那些乌鸦可是吃死人的呀？”","“Isn’t it true, monsieur, that crows eat the dead?”"
"“你个蠢货，娜农。它们逮着什么吃什么，跟世上其他东西一样。我们不都是靠死人活着吗？什么叫遗产？”","“You are a fool, Nanon.They eat what they can get, like the rest of the world.Don’t we all live on the dead?What are legacies?”"
"葛朗台先生再没什么要吩咐的了，便掏出他的表来，看到离早饭还有半小时可以用，他就拿起帽子，走过去吻了一下女儿，对她说：","Monsieur Grandet, having no further orders to give, drew out his watch, and seeing that he had half an hour to dispose of before breakfast, he took his hat, went and kissed his daughter, and said to her: "
"“你想不想到卢瓦尔河边的地里走走？我去那里有点事要办。”","“Do you want to come for a walk in the fields, down by the Loire?I have something to do there.”"
"欧仁妮拿上她那顶系有粉红缎带的草帽，然后父女俩沿着弯弯曲曲的街道往河岸走去。","Eugenie fetched her straw bonnet, lined with pink taffeta; then the father and daughter went down the winding street to the shore."
"“这么早你们去哪里呀？”克吕绍公证人碰到了他们，说道。","“Where are you going at this early hour?” said Cruchot, the notary, meeting them."
"“去办点事。”葛朗台回答道，他很清楚他的朋友为什么清早就出门。","“To see something,” answered Grandet, not duped by the matutinal appearance of his friend."
"当葛朗台老头去“办点事”的时候，公证人凭经验知道跟着他准有好处，于是便走上前去。","When Pere Grandet went to “see something,” the notary knew by experience there was something to be got by going with him, so he went."
"“来吧，克吕绍，”葛朗台说，“您是我的一个朋友。我会让您看看在好地里种杨树是多么愚蠢。”","“Come, Cruchot,” said Grandet, “you are one of my friends.I’ll show you what folly it is to plant poplar-trees on good ground.”"
"“您是说卢瓦尔河边草场的杨树让您赚了六万法郎很愚蠢？”克吕绍公证人说道，惊讶得睁大了眼睛，“您可真走运！就在南特缺白木的时节，您把树砍了，然后一棵三十法郎卖掉！”","“Do you call the sixty thousand francs that you pocketed for those that were in your fields down by the Loire, folly?” said Maitre Cruchot, opening his eyes with amazement.“What luck you have had!To cut down your trees at the very time they ran short of white-wood at Nantes, and to sell them at thirty francs!”"
"欧仁妮听着，不知道已走近自己一生当中最庄严的时刻，而公证人就要往她的头上加上一个至高无上的父母之命。葛朗台这时已来到卢瓦尔河畔他拥有的那片美丽的草原了，那里有三十个工人被雇来清理、填土和翻整以前种有杨树的地方。","Eugenie listened, without knowing that she approached the most solemn moment of her whole life, and that the notary was about to bring down upon her head a paternal and supreme sentence.Grandet had now reached the magnificent fields which he owned on the banks of the Loire, where thirty workmen were employed in clearing away, filling up, and levelling the spots formerly occupied by the poplars."
"“克吕绍公证人先生，看看这树曾经占了多大一块地！让，”他冲着一个工人喊道，“拿你的尺-尺-尺子，两-两边都量-量-量一下。”","“Maitre Cruchot, see how much ground this tree once took up! Jean,” he cried to a laborer, “m-m-measure with your r-r-rule, b-both ways.”"
"“四乘八英尺。”那个人说。","“Four times eight feet,” said the man."
"“糟蹋了三十二英尺，”葛朗台对克吕绍说道，“我这一排有三百棵杨树，是不是？好，那么，三百-百-百乘三-三十二就让我-我-我损失了五百捆干-干-干草，加上两边的两倍，是一千五，中间几排更多。那我们就算-算-算它是一千捆-捆-捆干-干-干草吧——”","“Thirty-two feet lost,” said Grandet to Cruchot.“I had three hundred poplars in this one line, isn’t that so?Well, then, three h-h-hundred times thir-thirty-two lost m-m-me five hundred in h-h-hay; add twice as much for the side rows,—fifteen hundred; the middle rows as much more.So we may c-c-call it a th-thousand b-b-bales of h-h-hay—” "
"“很好，”克吕绍帮他的朋友算着，说道，“一千捆大概值六百法郎。”","“Very good,” said Cruchot, to help out his friend, “a thousand bales are worth about six hundred francs.”"
"“算一-一千二百，因-因-因为再割一茬还能卖三、四百法郎。好，那么，就算-算-算一-一千二百法郎一年，四-四-四十年加利息，总-总-总共有——”","“Say t-t-twelve hundred, be-c-cause there’s three or four hundred francs on the second crop.Well, then, c-c-calculate that t-twelve hundred francs a year for f-f-forty years with interest c-c-comes to—” "
"“大概六万法郎吧。”公证人说。","“Say sixty thousand francs,” said the notary."
"“很高兴，总-总-总共有-有-有六-六-六万。非常好，”葛朗台不结巴了，接着说道，“两千棵四十年的杨树只让我赚五万法郎。这就亏了。我自己也发现了这一点。”葛朗台说道，一副自命不凡的样子，“让，把树坑都填上，只留下河岸边的那些，把我买的杨树苗栽到那里。把树栽到那里，它们就会从政府那里吸取营养了。”他说着，转头看着克吕绍，鼻子上的肉瘤微微动了一下，流露出挖苦透顶的冷笑。","“I am willing; c-c-comes t-t-to sixty th-th-thousand. Very good,” continued Grandet, without stuttering, “two thousand poplars forty years old will only yield me fifty thousand francs.There’s a loss.I have found that myself,” said Grandet, getting on his high horse.“Jean, fill up all the holes except those at the bank of the river; there you are to plant the poplars I have bought.Plant ’em there, and they’ll get nourishment from the government,” he said, turning to Cruchot, and giving a slight motion to the wen on his nose, which expressed more than the most ironical of smiles."
"“的的确确，杨树只该种在贫瘠的土壤里。”克吕绍说道，他对葛朗台的算计大为惊诧。","“True enough; poplars should only be planted on poor soil,” said Cruchot, amazed at Grandet’s calculations."
"“是-是-是的，先生。”老头讥讽地答道。","“Y-y-yes, monsieur,” answered the old man satirically."
"欧仁妮正在欣赏卢瓦尔河的美丽风景，没有注意到她父亲的盘算，可是当听到克吕绍说的话时，她马上侧耳倾听——","Eugenie, who was gazing at the sublime scenery of the Loire, and paying no attention to her father’s reckonings, presently turned an ear to the remarks of Cruchot when she heard him say,—"
"“看来您好像是从巴黎招了个女婿。整个索米尔都在谈论您的侄儿。我马上得立婚约了吧，嘿！葛朗台老头？”","“So you have brought a son-in-law from Paris.All Saumur is talking about your nephew.I shall soon have the marriage-contract to draw up, hey!Pere Grandet?”"
"“您起-起-起得这么早，就是来告-告-告诉我这些，”葛朗台说道，肉瘤也随之一起动了动，“好，老伙-伙-伙计，我就直说吧，把您想-想-想知道的都告-告-告给您。您看着吧，我宁可把-把-把我女儿扔进卢瓦尔河，也不会让-让-让她嫁给她的堂-堂-堂弟。这话您可以到处讲-讲-讲去——不，不用啦，让众人说-说-说去吧。”","“You g-g-got up very early to t-t-tell me that,” said Grandet, accompanying the remark with a motion of his wen.“Well, old c-c-comrade, I’ll be frank, and t-t-tell you what you want t-t-to know.I would rather, do you see, f-f-fling my daughter into the Loire than g-g-give her to her c-c-cousin.You may t-t-tell that everywhere,—no, never mind; let the world t-t-talk.”"
"这个回答让那个姑娘顿时头晕目眩，两眼发黑。她心头涌出的渺茫的希望突然间就开了花，像一团花一样变得真实而具体，她看着它们被割剪掉后凋落了一地。从前一天晚上开始，她已经寄情于夏尔，那种幸福使他们心心相通，但从此以后，苦难将会牢牢追随着他们。沉重的苦难要由她承担，幸运的光华与她无缘，这不就是女人崇高的命运吗？父爱怎么会在她父亲的心中荡然无存了呢？夏尔到底犯了什么罪呢？真是谜一样的问题！她刚刚萌发的爱情已经是个迷了，而且深不可测，如今又蒙上了一层神秘感。她往回走时，四肢发抖，当走到那阴暗的街道时，她呼吸到了岁月和世事印在那里的凄凉，不久前她还觉得那里喜气洋洋，现在她却伤感不已。爱情的教训一个也少不了。离家门还有几步时，她抢先走在父亲前面，在门槛等着他。但是葛朗台看见公证人手里的报纸，却突然停住，问道——　","This answer dazzled and blinded the young girl with sudden light.The distant hopes upspringing in her heart bloomed suddenly, became real, tangible, like a cluster of flowers, and she saw them cut down and wilting on the earth.Since the previous evening she had attached herself to Charles by those links of happiness which bind soul to soul; from henceforth suffering was to rivet them.Is it not the noble destiny of women to be more moved by the dark solemnities of grief than by the splendors of fortune?How was it that fatherly feeling had died out of her father’s heart?Of what crime had Charles been guilty?Mysterious questions!Already her dawning love, a mystery so profound, was wrapping itself in mystery.She walked back trembling in all her limbs; and when she reached the gloomy street, lately so joyous to her, she felt its sadness, she breathed the melancholy which time and events had printed there.None of love’s lessons lacked.A few steps from their own door she went on before her father and waited at the threshold.But Grandet, who saw a newspaper in the notary’s hand, stopped short and asked,—"
"“公债行情怎么样？”","“How are the Funds?”"
"“您从来不听我的建议，葛朗台，”克吕绍答道，“快买吧，除了能拿一笔高额的利息，两年后你会赚百分之二十，——八万法郎零五十生丁的年息是五千。”","“You never listen to my advice, Grandet,” answered Cruchot.“Buy soon; you will still make twenty per cent in two years, besides getting an excellent rate of interest,—five thousand a year for eighty thousand francs fifty centimes.”"
"“我们回头再说吧。”葛朗台一边答道，一边摸着他的下巴。","“We’ll see about that,” answered Grandet, rubbing his chin."
"“天哪！”公证人叫道。","“Good God!” exclaimed the notary."
"“哦，什么事？”葛朗台大声叫道，这时克吕绍已经把报纸放到了他的眼前，说道：","“Well, what?” cried Grandet; and at the same moment Cruchot put the newspaper under his eyes and said: "
"“看看这个！”","“Read that!”"
"“葛朗台先生，巴黎最受尊敬的商人之一，昨日循例前往交易所之后，用手枪击中脑部。他已将辞呈递交下议院议长，同时辞去商业法庭法官所兼各职。其破产实受其经纪人罗甘先生和公证人苏谢先生破产所连累。然而，以葛朗台先生享有的威望和信誉而论，本不难从其他商号获得必要资助。令人深感遗憾的是，这样一位德高望重的人士竟于一时绝望之中出此下策。”等等。","“Monsieur Grandet, one of the most respected merchants in Paris, blew his brains out yesterday, after making his usual appearance at the Bourse.He had sent his resignation to the president of the Chamber of Deputies, and had also resigned his functions as a judge of the commercial courts.The failures of Monsieur Roguin and Monsieur Souchet, his broker and his notary, had ruined him.The esteem felt for Monsieur Grandet and the credit he enjoyed were nevertheless such that he might have obtained the necessary assistance from other business houses.It is much to be regretted that so honorable a man should have yielded to momentary despair,” etc."
"“我早知道了。”老葡萄园主对公证人说。","“I knew it,” said the old wine-grower to the notary."
"这句话让公证人克吕绍顿时不寒而栗，虽然当公证人都轻易不会动感情，但想到巴黎的葛朗台可能曾经向索米尔的葛朗台乞求支援几百万却遭到了拒绝时，他不由得感到一股凉气顺着后脊梁贯下去。","The words sent a chill of horror through Maitre Cruchot, who, notwithstanding his impassibility as a notary, felt the cold running down his spine as he thought that Grandet of Paris had possibly implored in vain the millions of Grandet of Saumur."
"“那他的儿子呢，昨天那么高兴——”","“And his son, so joyous yesterday—” "
"“他还一无所知。”葛朗台答道，依旧很镇定。","“He knows nothing as yet,” answered Grandet, with the same composure."
"“再见！葛朗台先生。”克吕绍说，他现在已经明白了事情的原委，起身去给德蓬丰先生吃定心丸。","“Adieu! Monsieur Grandet,” said Cruchot, who now understood the state of the case, and went off to reassure Monsieur de Bonfons."
"一进屋，葛朗台发现早餐已经准备好了。葛朗台太太坐在她那个带着小脚轮的椅子上，正织着冬天用的袖套。欧仁妮搂着她的脖子，吻着她，那番热烈的情绪往往是内心藏着悲痛才会有的。","On entering, Grandet found breakfast ready.Madame Grandet, round whose neck Eugenie had flung her arms, kissing her with the quick effusion of feeling often caused by secret grief, was already seated in her chair on castors, knitting sleeves for the coming winter."
"“你们可以开饭啦，”娜农说着，她从楼上下来，一步四个台阶，“那个年轻人睡得像个小娃娃。他两眼闭着，别提多可爱啦！我进去叫他了，但没反应。”","“You can begin to eat,” said Nanon, coming downstairs four steps at a time, “the young one is sleeping like a cherub.Isn’t he a darling with his eyes shut?I went in and I called him: no answer.”"
"“让他睡吧，”葛朗台说，“他什么时候醒都来得及听坏消息的。”","“Let him sleep,” said Grandet, “he’ll wake soon enough to hear ill-tidings.”"
"“什么事？”欧仁妮一边问着，一边把两小块不到半盎司重的糖放入她的咖啡，那是老吝啬鬼闲着没事时自娱自乐切好的。葛朗台太太不敢发问，只是盯着她的丈夫。","“What is it?” asked Eugenie, putting into her coffee the two little bits of sugar weighing less than half an ounce which the old miser amused himself by cutting up in his leisure hours.Madame Grandet, who did not dare to put the question, gazed at her husband."
"“他父亲开枪打穿了自己的脑袋。”","“His father has blown his brains out.”"
"“我叔父？”欧仁妮说。","“My uncle?” said Eugenie."
"“可怜的年轻人！”葛朗台太太惊叫了起来。","“Poor young man!” exclaimed Madame Grandet."
"“确实可怜！”葛朗台说，“他身无分文！”","“Poor indeed!” said Grandet, “he isn’t worth a sou!”"
"“嗯！可怜的孩子，他还睡得像是全世界的国王！”娜农柔声说道。","“Eh! Poor boy, and he’s sleeping like the king of the world!” said Nanon in a gentle voice."
"欧仁妮停下来，不吃了。她的心揪紧了，就像一个姑娘初次面对爱人的苦难，溢满全身的痛惜之情会把她年轻的心揪得生疼。可怜的姑娘哭了。","Eugenie stopped eating.Her heart was wrung, as the young heart is wrung when pity for the suffering of one she loves overflows, for the first time, the whole being of a woman.The poor girl wept."
"“你哭什么呢？你又不认识你的叔父。”她父亲说着，用饿虎般的眼神瞪了她一眼，他瞪着他那成堆的金子时想必也是这个样子。","“What are you crying about? You didn’t know your uncle,” said her father, giving her one of those hungry tigerish looks he doubtless threw upon his piles of gold."
"“可是，先生，”娜农说，“谁不同情这个可怜的年轻人呢？他睡得像只木鞋一样沉，还不知道发生了什么事呢。”","“But, monsieur,” said Nanon, “who wouldn’t feel pity for the poor young man, sleeping there like a wooden shoe, without knowing what’s coming?”"
"“我没跟你说话，娜农。闭嘴！”","“I didn’t speak to you, Nanon.Hold your tongue!”"
"欧仁妮那一刻才知道恋爱的女人必须隐瞒自己的感情。她不做声了。","Eugenie learned at that moment that the woman who loves must be able to hide her feelings.She did not answer."
"“葛朗台太太，在我回来之前，你什么也不要跟他说，”老头说，“我得去整整路边的那排树篱。我中午回来，正好是午餐时间，那时我会跟我侄儿谈谈他的事情。至于你，欧仁妮小姐，如果你是在为那个公子哥哭，那就到此为止，孩子。他马上要去印度。你再也不会看见他了。”","“You will say nothing to him about it, Ma’ame Grandet, till I return,” said the old man.“I have to go and straighten the line of my hedge along the highroad.I shall be back at noon, in time for the second breakfast, and then I will talk with my nephew about his affairs.As for you, Mademoiselle Eugenie, if it is for that dandy you are crying, that’s enough, child.He’s going off like a shot to the Indies.You will never see him again.”"
"父亲从他的帽子边拿起手套，像平时一样镇定自如地戴上，并交叉两手的手指抻了抻，把手套戴妥帖了，然后就出了门。","The father took his gloves from the brim of his hat, put them on with his usual composure, pushed them in place by shoving the fingers of both hands together, and went out."
"“妈妈，我要窒息了！”等就剩她和母亲时，欧仁妮大声叫道，“我从来没有这么难受过。”","“Mamma, I am suffocating!” cried Eugenie when she was alone with her mother, “I have never suffered like this.”"
"葛朗台太太看见她脸色发白，便打开窗子，让她呼吸新鲜空气。","Madame Grandet, seeing that she turned pale, opened the window and let her breathe fresh air."
"“我觉得好一些了！”过了一会儿，欧仁妮说道。","“I feel better!” said Eugenie after a moment."
"女儿平素外表镇定冷静，现在居然如此紧张激动，这让葛朗台太太不安起来，她看着自己的女儿，凭着母亲天生惜子、心灵相通的直觉，她猜出了一切。事实上，匈牙利姐妹的生命只是因天生畸形而被束缚在一起，她们远不及欧仁妮和她母亲的关系亲密——她们总是一起坐在窗洞下，呼吸着同样的空气，睡在一起。","This nervous excitement in a nature hitherto, to all appearance, calm and cold, reacted on Madame Grandet; she looked at her daughter with the sympathetic intuition with which mothers are gifted for the objects of their tenderness, and guessed all.In truth the life of the Hungarian sisters, bound together by a freak of nature, could scarcely have been more intimate than that of Eugenie and her mother,—always together in the embrasure of that window, and sleeping together in the same atmosphere."
"“我可怜的孩子！”葛朗台太太说着，把欧仁妮的头揽住，并放在她的胸口。","“My poor child!” said Madame Grandet, taking Eugenie’s head and laying it upon her bosom."
"听到这句话，年轻的姑娘抬起头打量着母亲，似乎想揣摩出她内心深处的想法。","At these words the young girl raised her head, questioned her mother by a look, and seemed to search out her inmost thought."
"“为什么送他到印度？”她说，“如果他遭遇不幸，他难道不应该和我们呆在一起吗？难道他不是我们最亲的亲人？”","“Why send him to the Indies?” she said.“If he is unhappy, ought he not to stay with us?Is he not our nearest relation?”"
"“是的，我的孩子，这似乎是理所应当的，可你父亲有他自己的理由：我们必须尊重。”","“Yes, my child, it seems natural; but your father has his reasons: we must respect them.”"
"母女俩默默地坐下来，母亲坐在她垫高的椅子上，女儿坐在她的小扶手椅里，两个人都干起活来。欧仁妮非常感激母亲能完全理解自己的心意，她吻着母亲的手，说道——","The mother and daughter sat down in silence, the former upon her raised seat, the latter in her little armchair, and both took up their work.Swelling with gratitude for the full heart-understanding her mother had given her, Eugenie kissed the dear hand, saying,—"
"“您真好，我的好妈妈！”","“How good you are, my kind mamma!”"
"这句话使母亲那张因太多的悲伤而憔悴枯槁的脸上有了光彩。","The words sent a glow of light into the motherly face, worn and blighted as it was by many sorrows."
"“您喜欢他吗？”欧仁妮问道。","“You like him?” asked Eugenie."
"葛朗台太太只是报以微笑。接着，沉默了片刻之后，她低声说：","Madame Grandet only smiled in reply.Then, after a moment’s silence, she said in a low voice:"
"“你已经爱上他了吗？那可不好。”"," “Do you love him already?That is wrong.”"
"“不好？”欧仁妮说，“为什么不好？您喜欢他，娜农喜欢他，为什么我就不能喜欢他？喂，妈妈，咱们摆好桌子，等他吃早饭吧。”","“Wrong?” said Eugenie.“Why is it wrong?You are pleased with him, Nanon is pleased with him; why should he not please me?Come, mamma, let us set the table for his breakfast.”"
"她放下自己手中的活，她母亲也跟着放下，说道：“傻孩子！”但她却和女儿一起犯傻，以此来支持女儿。欧仁妮喊了喊娜农。","She threw down her work, and her mother did the same, saying, “Foolish child!”But she sanctioned the child’s folly by sharing it.Eugenie called Nanon."
"“你现在要什么，小姐？”","“What do you want now, mademoiselle?”"
"“娜农，到中午我们能吃上奶油吗？”","“Nanon, can we have cream by midday?”"
"“啊！中午，当然可以。”老佣人回答道。","“Ah! Midday, to be sure you can,” answered the old servant."
"“那好，给他喝的咖啡要特别浓，我听德格拉桑先生说，他们在巴黎都把咖啡做得很浓。多放点。”","“Well, let him have his coffee very strong; I heard Monsieur des Grassins say that they make the coffee very strong in Paris.Put in a great deal.”"
"“我去哪里弄去？”","“Where am I to get it?”"
"“买一点儿。”","“Buy some.”"
"“要是先生碰见我可怎么办？”","“Suppose monsieur meets me?”"
"“他去地里了。”","“He has gone to his fields.”"
"“那我就跑着去。可是昨天我买白蜡烛的时候，费萨尔先生问我，咱家是不是三王来朝了。咱们的一举一动，满城都知道。”","“I’ll run, then.But Monsieur Fessard asked me yesterday if the Magi had come to stay with us when I bought the wax candle.All the town will know our goings-on.”"
"“要是让你父亲发现了，”葛朗台太太说，“他会打咱们的。”","“If your father finds it out,” said Madame Grandet, “he is capable of beating us.”"
"“好啊，让他打吧，咱们就跪着让他打。”","“Well, let him beat us; we will take his blows on our knees.”"
"葛朗台回答的时候都抬着头望着天。娜农戴上头巾出去了。欧仁妮取出一块干净的桌布，又去拿回了几串葡萄，出于好玩儿，她曾经把葡萄挂在阁楼的一根绳子上，她轻轻地沿着走廊走着，生怕惊醒她的堂弟，却又忍不住贴着房门听他静静的呼吸声。","Madame Grandet for all answer raised her eyes to heaven.Nanon put on her hood and went off.Eugenie got out some clean table-linen, and went to fetch a few bunches of grapes which she had amused herself by hanging on a string across the attic; she walked softly along the corridor, so as not to waken her cousin, and she could not help listening at the door to his quiet breathing."
"“大祸临头，他还在睡觉。”她想。","“Sorrow is watching while he sleeps,” she thought."
"她拿起最新鲜的葡萄叶，像个老道的管家一样，把葡萄果盘摆得十分精美，然后得意洋洋地放上了餐桌。她把父亲已经数好的梨拿来，用叶子搭配，堆成了一个金字塔。她走过来走过去，连跑带跳。她恨不得把父亲家里所有的东西都给摆出来，但可惜钥匙都在父亲的口袋里。娜农拿着两颗鲜鸡蛋回来了。看见鸡蛋，欧仁妮差一点儿要去搂她的脖子。","She took the freshest vine-leaves and arranged her dish of grapes as coquettishly as a practised house-keeper might have done, and placed it triumphantly on the table.She laid hands on the pears counted out by her father, and piled them in a pyramid mixed with leaves.She went and came, and skipped and ran.She would have liked to lay under contribution everything in her father’s house; but the keys were in his pocket.Nanon came back with two fresh eggs.At sight of them Eugenie almost hugged her round the neck."
"“从朗德来的佃户的篮子里有鲜鸡蛋。我跟他要，他就给了我，那可爱的人，一分没要，就为了讨好我！”","“The farmer from Lande had them in his basket.I asked him for them, and he gave them to me, the darling, for nothing, as an attention!”"
"第五章","Chapter V "
"精心准备了两个小时，欧仁妮终于做成了一份简单的午餐，虽然花钱并不多，但还是大大背离了家里根深蒂固的老规矩。在这两个小时里，她曾二十次放下活计跳起来，去看咖啡是否煮开了，或是去听堂弟穿衣打扮的动静。午餐总是站着吃的。每个人吃一片面包，一点儿水果或者一些黄油，还有一杯葡萄酒。桌子被拉到壁炉旁，扶手椅放在了堂弟的餐具前，桌上有两盘水果、一个蛋杯、一瓶白葡萄酒、面包，以及一个放满糖的碟子。欧仁妮望着这些，一想到父亲此时要是进来瞪着她的样子，她的四肢就开始哆嗦。她不时地望望时钟，看堂弟能否在这位主人回来之前吃完早餐。","After two hours’ thought and care, during which Eugenie jumped up twenty times from her work to see if the coffee were boiling, or to go and listen to the noise her cousin made in dressing, she succeeded in preparing a simple little breakfast, very inexpensive, but which, nevertheless, departed alarmingly from the inveterate customs of the house.The midday breakfast was always taken standing.Each took a slice of bread, a little fruit or some butter, and a glass of wine.As Eugenie looked at the table drawn up near the fire with an armchair placed before her cousin’s plate, at the two dishes of fruit, the egg-cup, the bottle of white wine, the bread, and the sugar heaped up in a saucer, she trembled in all her limbs at the mere thought of the look her father would give her if he should come in at that moment.She glanced often at the clock to see if her cousin could breakfast before the master’s return."
"“别担心，欧仁妮，如果你父亲进来，我来担当一切。”葛朗台太太说。","“Don’t be troubled, Eugenie; if your father comes in, I will take it all upon myself,” said Madame Grandet."
"欧仁妮禁不住流下了眼泪。","Eugenie could not repress a tear."
"“哦，我的好妈妈！”她哭喊道，“我对您永远都爱不够。”","“Oh, my good mother!” she cried, “I have never loved you enough.”"
"夏尔小声哼着歌，在房内踱来踱去，过了一会儿才下来。还好，才十一点。真正的巴黎人！他竭尽所能打扮出公子哥的派头，仿佛他是呆在此时正在苏格兰旅游的那位贵妇家的城堡里。他走进屋子，带着微笑，彬彬有礼，同他焕发的青春十分相配，这让欧仁妮的心跳着，又悲又喜。他高高兴兴地走向他的伯母，早已把安茹豪门大宅的破灭看作一个玩笑。","Charles, who had been tramping about his room for some time, singing to himself, now came down.Happily, it was only eleven o’clock.The true Parisian! He had put as much dandyism into his dress as if he were in the chateau of the noble lady then travelling in Scotland.He came into the room with the smiling, courteous manner so becoming to youth, which made Eugenie’s heart beat with mournful joy.He had taken the destruction of his castles in Anjou as a joke, and came up to his aunt gaily."
"“您睡得好吗，亲爱的伯母？还有你，我的堂姐？”","“Have you slept well, dear aunt? And you, too, my cousin?”"
"“非常好，先生，你呢？”葛朗台太太说道。","“Very well, monsieur, did you?” said Madame Grandet."
"“我？好极了。”","“I? Perfectly.”"
"“你一定饿了，堂弟，”欧仁妮说，“坐下吧？”","“You must be hungry, cousin,” said Eugenie, “will you take your seat?”"
"“中午前我从不吃早点，不到中午我从不起床的。不过，我一路上颠簸，很高兴马上能吃点什么。而且——”说着，他掏出布勒盖制造的精美绝伦的怀表，“哎哟！我起早了，才十一点！”","“I never breakfast before midday; I never get up till then.However, I fared so badly on the journey that I am glad to eat something at once.Besides—” here he pulled out the prettiest watch Breguet ever made.“Dear me!I am early, it is only eleven o’clock!”"
"“早？”葛朗台太太说。","“Early?” said Madame Grandet."
"“是的，不过，我想整理一下我的东西。好吧，我将很高兴吃点什么——鸡呀，山鹑呀，随便什么都行。”","“Yes; but I wanted to put my things in order.Well, I shall be glad to have anything to eat,—anything, it doesn’t matter what, a chicken, a partridge.”"
"“圣母玛利亚！”娜农无意中听到了这些话，惊叫道。","“Holy Virgin!” exclaimed Nanon, overhearing the words."
"“一只山鹑！”欧仁妮心里嘀咕着，她倒甘愿用她全部的那点儿私房钱买上一只山鹑。","“A partridge!” whispered Eugenie to herself; she would gladly have given the whole of her little hoard for a partridge."
"“来，坐下。”他伯母说道。","“Come and sit down,” said his aunt."
"这位年轻的公子哥坐进靠椅里，就像一个美貌女子优雅地倚在沙发上一样。欧仁妮和她母亲拿了普通椅子坐在他旁边，挨着壁炉。","The young dandy let himself drop into an easy-chair, just as a pretty woman falls gracefully upon a sofa.Eugenie and her mother took ordinary chairs and sat beside him, near the fire."
"“你们一直住这里？”夏尔说道，觉得这屋子白天看着比昨晚更难看了。","“Do you always live here?” said Charles, thinking the room uglier by daylight than it had seemed the night before."
"“一直住在这里，”欧仁妮看着他，回答道，“除了葡萄收获的季节。那时我们去帮娜农，住在努瓦耶修道院。”","“Always,” answered Eugenie, looking at him, “except during the vintage.Then we go and help Nanon, and live at the Abbaye des Noyers.”"
"“你们从不散步吗？”","“Don’t you ever take walks?”"
"“有时候星期天做完晚祷，若是天气晴朗，”葛朗台太太说道，“我们会到桥上走走，或者去看看割草。”","“Sometimes on Sunday after vespers, when the weather is fine,” said Madame Grandet, “we walk on the bridge, or we go and watch the haymakers.”"
"“你们这里有剧院吗？”","“Have you a theatre?”"
"“去剧院！”葛朗台太太惊呼道，“看剧！哎哟，先生，你不知道那是不可饶恕的罪孽吗？”","“Go to the theatre!” exclaimed Madame Grandet, “see a play!Why, monsieur, don’t you know it is a mortal sin?”"
"“喂，先生，”娜农拿进来鸡蛋，说道，“这是给您的鸡——带壳儿的。”","“See here, monsieur,” said Nanon, bringing in the eggs, “here are your chickens,—in the shell.”"
"“哦！新鲜的鸡蛋。”夏尔说道，像所有惯于奢侈的人一样，他早就把他的山鹑忘了，“那可好吃了，现在，我的好姑娘，你能不能给我些黄油。”","“Oh! Fresh eggs,” said Charles, who, like all people accustomed to luxury, had already forgotten about his partridge, “that is delicious: now, if you will give me the butter, my good girl.”"
"“黄油！那你就吃不上烤饼了。”","“Butter! Then you can’t have the @galette@.”"
"“娜农，拿黄油来。”欧仁妮大声喊道。","“Nanon, bring the butter,” cried Eugenie."
"在堂弟切面包片的时候，年轻的姑娘瞧着他，看得津津有味，就像一个女工看一出无辜纯洁的人最终得胜的传奇剧一样。夏尔曾得到风度迷人的母亲的调教，受过一位时髦女子的提携和熏陶，有着花花公子那些雅致、娇媚、矫揉造作的形容举止。少女的同情与温柔所具有的力量实际上如磁石一般，以至于夏尔在发现自己成了伯母和堂姐关注的对象时，无法逃避那感情的冲击，那些感情向他汹涌而来的，可以说，是将他淹没的。他向欧仁妮投去灿烂、爱抚的目光，充满善意——那目光似乎本身就是一种微笑。当他的目光停留在她的身上时，他察觉到她那纯洁的脸上，线条和谐到极致，她天真无邪的神态是那么优雅，那双眼睛清澈而有魅力，闪烁着青春洋溢的爱情，不由自主地流露出内心的渴望来。","The young girl watched her cousin as he cut his sippets, with as much pleasure as a grisette takes in a melodrama where innocence and virtue triumph.Charles, brought up by a charming mother, improved, and trained by a woman of fashion, had the elegant, dainty, foppish movements of a coxcomb.The compassionate sympathy and tenderness of a young girl possess a power that is actually magnetic, so that Charles, finding himself the object of the attentions of his aunt and cousin, could not escape the influence of feelings which flowed towards him, as it were, and inundated him.He gave Eugenie a bright, caressing look full of kindness,—a look which seemed itself a smile.He perceived, as his eyes lingered upon her, the exquisite harmony of features in the pure face, the grace of her innocent attitude, the magic clearness of the eyes, where young love sparkled and desire shone unconsciously."
"“啊！我亲爱的堂姐，如果你穿着盛装出现在歌剧院里，我敢向你保证，我伯母的话将会变成事实——你会让男人艳羡，让女人嫉妒，全得犯不可饶恕的罪孽。”","“Ah! My dear cousin, if you were in full dress at the Opera, I assure you my aunt’s words would come true,—you would make the men commit the mortal sin of envy, and the women the sin of jealousy.”"
"这番恭维打动了欧仁妮的心，并让它跳个不停，尽管她没有听懂意思。","The compliment went to Eugenie’s heart and set it beating, though she did not understand its meaning."
"“哦！堂弟，”她说，“你是在笑话一个可怜的乡下丫头吧。”","“Oh! Cousin,” she said, “you are laughing at a poor little country girl.”"
"“堂姐，你要是了解我，就知道我讨厌嘲弄人，它使人心寒，伤害我所有的感情。”说着，他非常优雅地咽下了一块涂着黄油的面包，“不，我的确没有足够的头脑来取笑别人，毫无疑问，这是个大缺陷。在巴黎，当他们想诋毁一个人时，就说：‘他心地善良’。这话的意思是：‘这可怜的家伙笨得像头犀牛’。可是因为我有钱，而且谁都知道，即使是在野外，我都能用任何型号的手枪在三十步开外打中靶心，没人敢取笑我。”","“If you knew me, my cousin, you would know that I abhor ridicule; it withers the heart and jars upon all my feelings.”Here he swallowed his buttered sippet very gracefully.“No, I really have not enough mind to make fun of others; and doubtless it is a great defect.In Paris, when they want to disparage a man, they say: ‘He has a good heart.’ The phrase means: ‘The poor fellow is as stupid as a rhinoceros.’ But as I am rich, and known to hit the bull’s-eye at thirty paces with any kind of pistol, and even in the open fields, ridicule respects me.”"
"“我亲爱的侄子，那证明你的心好。”","“My dear nephew, that bespeaks a good heart.”"
"“你的戒指真漂亮，”欧仁妮说，“给我瞧瞧不碍事吧？”","“You have a very pretty ring,” said Eugenie, “is there any harm in asking to see it?”"
"夏尔摘下戒指后，伸出手，欧仁妮的指尖碰到了堂弟粉红色的指甲，她的脸红了。","Charles held out his hand after loosening the ring, and Eugenie blushed as she touched the pink nails of her cousin with the tips of her fingers."
"“看呀，妈妈，多美的做工。”","“See, mamma, what beautiful workmanship.”"
"“哦！得好多金子啊！”娜农端了咖啡进来，说道。","“My! There’s a lot of gold!” said Nanon, bringing in the coffee."
"“那是什么？”夏尔指着一个长椭圆形的褐色陶壶，笑着叫道。那陶壶里层上了釉，边上有一圈灰土，咖啡渣在煮开的水里冒着泡翻上来，又沉下去。","“What is that?” exclaimed Charles, laughing, as he pointed to an oblong pot of brown earthenware, glazed on the inside, and edged with a fringe of ashes, from the bottom of which the coffee-grounds were bubbling up and falling in the boiling liquid."
"“这是煮好的咖啡。”娜农说。","“It is boiled coffee,” said Nanon."
"“啊！我亲爱的伯母，我来这里无论如何得做点好事留个纪念。你们真是太落伍了！我得教你们用双层咖啡壶来煮出优质的咖啡。”","“Ah! My dear aunt, I shall at least leave one beneficent trace of my visit here.You are indeed behind the age!I must teach you to make good coffee in a Chaptal coffee-pot.”"
"他尽力讲解了双层咖啡壶的用法。","He tried to explain the process of a Chaptal coffee-pot."
"“老天！如果有那么多事要做，”娜农说道，“我们得花一辈子才能煮好咖啡吧。我才不会那样煮咖啡呢，我可知道那回事！唉，我煮咖啡的时候，谁给牛弄草料呀？”","“Gracious! If there are so many things as all that to do,” said Nanon, “we may as well give up our lives to it.I shall never make coffee that way; I know that!Pray, who is to get the fodder for the cow while I make the coffee?”"
"“我来。”欧仁妮说。","“I will make it,” said Eugenie."
"“孩子！”葛朗台太太看着女儿，说道。","“Child!” said Madame Grandet, looking at her daughter."
"这句话让三个女人想起了这个不幸的年轻人即将大祸临头，她们沉默了，带着怜悯的神情看着他，这引起了他的注意。","The word recalled to their minds the sorrow that was about to fall upon the unfortunate young man; the three women were silent, and looked at him with an air of commiseration that caught his attention."
"“什么事，堂姐？”他说。","“Is anything the matter, my cousin?” he said."
"“嘘！”欧仁妮正要回答，葛朗台太太冲她说道，“你知道的，女儿，你父亲叫我们不要跟先生说——”","“Hush!” said Madame Grandet to Eugenie, who was about to answer, “you know, my daughter, that your father charged us not to speak to monsieur—” "
"“叫夏尔。”年轻的葛朗台说。","“Say Charles,” said young Grandet."
"“啊！你叫夏尔？多美的名字！”欧仁妮叫了起来。","“Ah! You are called Charles?What a beautiful name!” cried Eugenie."
"对祸事的预感差不多总是会应验的。娜农、葛朗台太太和欧仁妮三个人一直战战兢兢地想着老头要回来，偏偏这时就听到了他们非常熟悉的敲门声。","Presentiments of evil are almost always justified.At this moment Nanon, Madame Grandet, and Eugenie, who had all three been thinking with a shudder of the old man’s return, heard the knock whose echoes they knew but too well."
"“是爸爸！”欧仁妮说。","“There’s papa!” said Eugenie."
"她拿走了盛满糖的碟子，只在桌布上留了几块；娜农撤走了蛋杯；葛朗台太太像受惊的兔子一样站了起来。明显是一片慌乱，这让夏尔觉得很诧异，弄得他一头雾水。","She removed the saucer filled with sugar, leaving a few pieces on the table-cloth; Nanon carried off the egg-cup; Madame Grandet sat up like a frightened hare.It was evidently a panic, which amazed Charles, who was wholly unable to understand it."
"“嗨！怎么啦？”他问道。","“Why! What is the matter?” he asked."
"“我父亲回来了。”欧仁妮答道。","“My father has come,” answered Eugenie."
"“嗯，那又怎样？”","“Well, what of that?”"
"葛朗台先生进了屋子，用锐利的目光扫了眼桌子，又看了看夏尔，就明白了是怎么回事。","Monsieur Grandet entered the room, threw his keen eye upon the table, upon Charles, and saw the whole thing."
"“哈！哈！这么说你是在设宴招待你侄儿呢，非常好，非常好，的确非常好！”他说道，一点儿也不结巴，“猫不在，老鼠玩儿得自在。”","“Ha! Ha! So you have been making a feast for your nephew; very good, very good, very good indeed!” he said, without stuttering.“When the cat’s away, the mice will play.”"
"“设宴！”夏尔心想，猜不出，也想象不出这家人的规矩和习惯。","“Feast!” thought Charles, incapable of suspecting or imagining the rules and customs of the household."
"“拿我的杯子来，娜农。”这位主人说道。","“Give me my glass, Nanon,” said the master."
"欧仁妮拿来了酒杯。葛朗台从马裤口袋里掏出一把宽刃牛角刀，切了片面包，取了点黄油，仔细地抹在了面包上，站着吃了起来。这时，夏尔正往自己的咖啡里放糖。葛朗台老头看到糖块，瞪了眼脸色发白的妻子，朝前走了三步，俯下身凑到那可怜的女人耳边，说道——","Eugenie brought the glass.Grandet drew a horn-handled knife with a big blade from his breeches’ pocket, cut a slice of bread, took a small bit of butter, spread it carefully on the bread, and ate it standing.At this moment Charlie was sweetening his coffee.Pere Grandet saw the bits of sugar, looked at his wife, who turned pale, and made three steps forward; he leaned down to the poor woman’s ear and said,—"
"“你从哪里弄来的糖？”","“Where did you get all that sugar?”"
"“娜农从费萨尔铺子买来的，家里没有了。”","“Nanon fetched it from Fessard’s; there was none.”"
"简直无法想象这三个女人对这无声的一幕是多么担心。娜农离开厨房，站着往屋里张望，看会发生什么事。夏尔尝了尝他的咖啡，觉得苦，就瞅来瞅去找糖，而葛朗台早已把糖收了起来。","It is impossible to picture the profound interest the three women took in this mute scene.Nanon had left her kitchen and stood looking into the room to see what would happen.Charles, having tasted his coffee, found it bitter and glanced about for the sugar, which Grandet had already put away."
"“你想要什么？”他伯父问。","“What do you want?” said his uncle."
"“糖。”","“The sugar.”"
"“再多加些奶，”这位一家之主答道，“咖啡喝着就不苦了。”","“Put in more milk,” answered the master of the house, “your coffee will taste sweeter.”"
"欧仁妮把葛朗台收拾走的碟子又放到桌子上，她一边放，一边镇定地看着她的父亲。的的确确，巴黎女人用娇弱的双臂抓住丝绸结成的绳梯来帮助情人逃走时，她显示的勇气也未必胜得过欧仁妮把糖重新放上桌子时的勇气。当她骄傲地给情人看她那带伤的玉臂时，她的情人会报答这个情妇，用眼泪和亲吻来清洗每一道肿起的血管，直到伤痛因幸福而被治愈。可是，堂姐内心正焦虑万分、痛苦至极，在那个老吝啬鬼的逼视下，更是忧心如焚，这个秘密夏尔永远也不会知道。","Eugenie took the saucer which Grandet had put away and placed it on the table, looking calmly at her father as she did so.Most assuredly, the Parisian woman who held a silken ladder with her feeble arms to facilitate the flight of her lover, showed no greater courage than Eugenie displayed when she replaced the sugar upon the table.The lover rewarded his mistress when she proudly showed him her beautiful bruised arm, and bathed every swollen vein with tears and kisses till it was cured with happiness.Charles, on the other hand, never so much as knew the secret of the cruel agitation that shook and bruised the heart of his cousin, crushed as it was by the look of the old miser."
"“你不吃午饭，太太。”","“You are not eating your breakfast, wife.”"
"那可怜的女奴一副恭顺的样子走上前来，给自己切了块面包，又拿了一个梨。欧仁妮大着胆子给父亲递了些葡萄，说——","The poor helot came forward with a piteous look, cut herself a piece of bread, and took a pear.Eugenie boldly offered her father some grapes, saying,—"
"“尝尝我存的葡萄，爸爸。堂弟，你也来点儿，好不好？这些葡萄不错，我特地给你摘的。”","“Taste my preserves, papa.My cousin, you will eat some, will you not?I went to get these pretty grapes expressly for you.”"
"“要是没人拦着，她们会为了你，洗劫索米尔城的，侄儿。等你吃完了，我们到花园去，我有事要告诉你，那可不是甜的。”","“If no one stops them, they will pillage Saumur for you, nephew.When you have finished, we will go into the garden; I have something to tell you which can’t be sweetened.”"
"欧仁妮和母亲瞅了夏尔一眼，那意思这个年轻人是不会弄错的。","Eugenie and her mother cast a look on Charles whose meaning the young man could not mistake."
"“您的话是什么意思，伯父？自从我可怜的母亲去世以后，”——说到这几个词时，他的声音软了下来——“其他任何不幸都不会让我难过了。”","“What is it you mean, uncle?Since the death of my poor mother”—at these words his voice softened—“no other sorrow can touch me.”"
"“侄儿，谁知道上帝喜欢让咱们遭什么罪呢？”他的伯母说道。","“My nephew, who knows by what afflictions God is pleased to try us?” said his aunt."
"“得，得，得，得，”葛朗台说，“又开始胡说八道了。看到你这双白白的手，我真难受，侄儿，”说着，他伸出老天爷安在他手臂尽头的拳头，那拳头像羊肩膀似的，“这是双生来抓银子的手。你从小受的教育，是把我们用来做钱包的小山羊皮穿在脚上。这事可太糟糕了！很糟糕！”","“Ta, ta, ta, ta,” said Grandet, “there’s your nonsense beginning.I am sorry to see those white hands of yours, nephew,” and he showed the shoulder-of-mutton fists which Nature had put at the end of his own arms.“There’s a pair of hands made to pick up silver pieces.You’ve been brought up to put your feet in the kid out of which we make the purses we keep our money in.A bad lookout!Very bad!”"
"“您想说什么，伯父？您说的话，我要是能听懂哪怕一个字，就不得好死。”","“What do you mean, uncle?I’ll be hanged if I understand a single word of what you are saying.”"
"“来吧！”葛朗台说。","“Come!” said Grandet."
"这个守财奴啪嗒一声合上刀，把最后一点儿酒喝掉，然后开了门。","The miser closed the blade of his knife with a snap, drank the last of his wine, and opened the door."
"“堂弟，勇敢点！”","“My cousin, take courage!”"
"年轻姑娘的语气让夏尔的心感到惊恐，他跟在他那可怕的伯父后面，忐忑不安。欧仁妮、她母亲和娜农去了厨房，按捺不住好奇心，想看看在花园即将上演的那场戏中的两位演员。花园里，一开始，伯父只是默不作声地走在侄子的前面。对夏尔说出他父亲的死讯，葛朗台并不觉得怎么为难，但知道夏尔已经不名一文，他倒生出了几分同情，于是他就寻思着用什么话或者措辞可以把那残酷的事实讲得和缓一些。“你已经失去你的父亲了”，这话对他来说好像没什么大不了的，父亲总是死在孩子的前面。可是“你一点儿家产都没有了”——人世间所有的不幸都概括在这几个词当中了！葛朗台绕着花园走了三圈，砂石在他沉重的脚步下咯咯作响。","The tone of the young girl struck terror to Charles’s heart, and he followed his terrible uncle, a prey to disquieting thoughts.Eugenie, her mother, and Nanon went into the kitchen, moved by irresistible curiosity to watch the two actors in the scene which was about to take place in the garden, where at first the uncle walked silently ahead of the nephew.Grandet was not at all troubled at having to tell Charles of the death of his father; but he did feel a sort of compassion in knowing him to be without a penny, and he sought for some phrase or formula by which to soften the communication of that cruel truth.“You have lost your father,” seemed to him a mere nothing to say; fathers die before their children.But “you are absolutely without means,”—all the misfortunes of life were summed up in those words!Grandet walked round the garden three times, the gravel crunching under his heavy step."
"在人生的关键时刻，我们的心总是会对大喜大悲降临的地方念念不忘。夏尔特别细心地注意到小花园的黄杨、那飘然坠落的黄叶、那剥落的墙壁、那奇形怪状的果树——由于强烈的情感会产生特有的记忆功能，这些如画般的细节将永远留在他的记忆深处，和对这个重大时刻的种种回忆交织在一起。","In the crucial moments of life our minds fasten upon the locality where joys or sorrows overwhelm us.Charles noticed with minute attention the box-borders of the little garden, the yellow leaves as they fluttered down, the dilapidated walls, the gnarled fruit-trees,—picturesque details which were destined to remain forever in his memory, blending eternally, by the mnemonics that belong exclusively to the passions, with the recollections of this solemn hour."
"“天气真好，非常暖和。”葛朗台说着，深深吸了一口气。","“It is very fine weather, very warm,” said Grandet, drawing a long breath."
"“是的，伯父，可为什么——”","“Yes, uncle; but why—” "
"“好吧，我的孩子，”他的伯父答道，“我有个坏消息要告诉你。你父亲病了——”","“Well, my lad,” answered his uncle, “I have some bad news to give you.Your father is ill—” "
"“那我还在这里干嘛？”夏尔说。“娜农，”他喊道，“订驿站的马！我总该能从哪里弄到一辆马车吧？”他又说着，转向他那站着一动不动的伯父。","“Then why am I here?” said Charles.“Nanon,” he cried, “order post-horses!I can get a carriage somewhere?”he added, turning to his uncle, who stood motionless."
"“马和车都没用，”葛朗台答道，他看着夏尔，夏尔一言不发，两眼发了呆，“是的，我可怜的孩子，你猜对了——他死了。但那并不算什么，更糟糕的是：他用枪打穿了自己的脑袋。”","“Horses and carriages are useless,” answered Grandet, looking at Charles, who remained silent, his eyes growing fixed.“Yes, my poor boy, you guess the truth,—he is dead.But that’s nothing; there is something worse: he blew out his brains.”"
"“我的父亲呀！”","“My father!”"
"“是啊，可这还不算最糟糕的，报纸上都在说这件事。给，看看吧。”","“Yes, but that’s not the worst; the newspapers are all talking about it.Here, read that.”"
"葛朗台跟克吕绍借来了那篇要命的文章，他把报纸戳到侄子眼前。那可怜的年轻人还是个孩子，这个年纪还不懂得掩饰感情，他顿时大哭起来。","Grandet, who had borrowed the fatal article from Cruchot, thrust the paper under his nephew’s eyes.The poor young man, still a child, still at an age when feelings wear no mask, burst into tears."
"“这下好啦！”葛朗台心想，“他的两眼真叫我害怕。哭了他就会好的——这还不算最坏的，我可怜的侄儿，”不管夏尔是否在听，他高声说道，“不要紧，你会挺过去的：但是——”","“That’s good!” thought Grandet, “his eyes frightened me.He’ll be all right if he weeps,—that is not the worst, my poor nephew,” he said aloud, not noticing whether Charles heard him, “that is nothing; you will get over it: but—” "
"“永远不会，永远不会！我的父亲！哦，我的父亲！”","“Never, never!My father!Oh, my father!”"
"“他毁了你，你一个子儿也没了。”","“He has ruined you, you haven’t a penny.”"
"“那有什么关系？我的父亲呀！我的父亲在哪里？”","“What does that matter?My father!Where is my father?”"
"他的抽泣在那沉闷的院墙内骇人地回荡起来，回音不绝。那三个女人心中充满了怜悯，也哭了，因为哭经常跟笑一样是会传染的。夏尔没有继续听他的伯父说下去，从院子里跑过去，跑到了楼上自己的卧室里。他扑到床上，把脸埋进被单里，躲开众人，为失去的双亲痛哭起来。","His sobs resounded horribly against those dreary walls and reverberated in the echoes.The three women, filled with pity, wept also; for tears are often as contagious as laughter.Charles, without listening further to his uncle, ran through the court and up the staircase to his chamber, where he threw himself across the bed and hid his face in the sheets, to weep in peace for his lost parents."
"“第一次突如其来的灾难必须要告诉他，”葛朗台说着，进了客厅，欧仁妮和她母亲刚匆匆回到各自的座位，擦了眼泪，用颤抖的双手做着缝补，“可那个年轻人真没出息，他把死人看得比他的钱还重。”","“The first burst must have its way,” said Grandet, entering the living-room, where Eugenie and her mother had hastily resumed their seats and were sewing with trembling hands, after wiping their eyes.“But that young man is good for nothing; his head is more taken up with the dead than with his money.”"
"当听到父亲对最神圣的悲痛之情说出这样的话来，欧仁妮打了个寒颤。从那一刻起，她开始评判起他来。夏尔的抽噎尽管低沉，仍然在这阴沉的房子里回荡着，他沉痛的哀嚎仿佛来自于地下，慢慢变弱，到傍晚时才停息。","Eugenie shuddered as she heard her father’s comment on the most sacred of all griefs.From that moment she began to judge him.Charles’s sobs, though muffled, still sounded through the sepulchral house; and his deep groans, which seemed to come from the earth beneath, only ceased towards evening, after growing gradually feebler."
"“可怜的年轻人！”葛朗台太太说。","“Poor young man!” said Madame Grandet."
"这感叹简直要命！葛朗台老头看看妻子，又看看欧仁妮和糖碗。他想起了为这个倒霉的年轻人准备的那顿丰盛的午餐，便走到屋子中间。","Fatal exclamation!Pere Grandet looked at his wife, at Eugenie, and at the sugar-bowl.He recollected the extraordinary breakfast prepared for the unfortunate youth, and he took a position in the middle of the room."
"“听我说，”他保持着往常的镇定，说道，“葛朗台太太，我希望你以后不要再这么铺张了。我把我的钱给你，可不是为了给那个年轻人买糖吃的。”","“Listen to me,” he said, with his usual composure.“I hope that you will not continue this extravagance, Madame Grandet.I don’t give you MY money to stuff that young fellow with sugar.”"
"“那不关我母亲的事，”欧仁妮说，“是我——”","“My mother had nothing to do with it,” said Eugenie, “it was I who—” "
"“是因为你长大了，”葛朗台打断女儿的话，说道，“就想跟我作对？记着，欧仁妮——”","“Is it because you are of age,” said Grandet, interrupting his daughter, “that you choose to contradict me?Remember, Eugenie—” "
"“父亲，您兄弟的儿子应该从我们这里得到——”","“Father, the son of your brother ought to receive from us—” "
"“得，得，得，得！”箍桶匠用四个半音阶喊道，“又是我兄弟的儿子，又是我侄儿的！夏尔跟我们毫不相干，他一个子儿没有，他父亲破产了。等这个公子哥哭够了，他就得从这里滚蛋。我可不能让他把我的家搅得天翻地覆的。”","“Ta, ta, ta, ta!” exclaimed the cooper on four chromatic tones, “the son of my brother this, my nephew that!Charles is nothing at all to us; he hasn’t a farthing, his father has failed; and when this dandy has cried his fill, off he goes from here.I won’t have him revolutionize my household.”"
"“什么是‘破产’，父亲？”欧仁妮问道。","“What is ‘failing,’ father?” asked Eugenie."
"“破产，”她父亲回答道，“就是干了最可耻的事，让人丢尽脸面。”","“To fail,” answered her father, “is to commit the most dishonorable action that can disgrace a man.”"
"“那一定是很大的罪孽吧，”葛朗台太太说，“我们的兄弟要进地狱吧。”","“It must be a great sin,” said Madame Grandet, “and our brother may be damned.”"
"“得啦，得啦，别唠叨了！”葛朗台说着，耸了耸肩膀，“破产，欧仁妮，”他又说道，“是一种偷窃，很不幸，却受法律保护。人们相信纪尧姆·葛朗台讲信用和诚实的名声，把财产托付给他，他却把那些财产全部给吞了，什么也没给他们留下，只留给他们痛哭的双眼。路上的强盗都比破产者要好：强盗攻击你，你还可以防卫，他有丢掉性命的危险；可是破产者呢——总之，夏尔是名誉扫地了。”","“There, there, don’t begin with your litanies!” said Grandet, shrugging his shoulders.“To fail, Eugenie,” he resumed, “is to commit a theft which the law, unfortunately, takes under its protection.People have given their property to Guillaume Grandet trusting to his reputation for honor and integrity; he has made away with it all, and left them nothing but their eyes to weep with.A highway robber is better than a bankrupt: the one attacks you and you can defend yourself, he risks his own life; but the other—in short, Charles is dishonored.”"
"这些话在可怜的姑娘心里嗡嗡作响，字字千钧压在她的心头。她正直而又娇嫩，像生在密林深处的一朵花一样，既不谙尘世之道，又不懂骗人的说理和似是而非的诡辩；因而，她就相信了父亲这番可恶的解释，他其实故意掩盖了迫不得已的破产和有计划的破产之间存在的区别。","The words rang in the poor girl’s heart and weighed it down with their heavy meaning.Upright and delicate as a flower born in the depths of a forest, she knew nothing of the world’s maxims, of its deceitful arguments and specious sophisms; she therefore believed the atrocious explanation which her father gave her designedly, concealing the distinction which exists between an involuntary failure and an intentional one."
"“父亲，您难道不能阻止这场灾祸吗？”","“Father, could you not have prevented such a misfortune?”"
"“我兄弟没找我商量过。而且，他欠了四百万。”","“My brother did not consult me.Besides, he owes four millions.”"
"“什么是‘百万’，父亲？”她带着孩子般的天真问道，以为想知道什么，就马上可以弄清楚。","“What is a ‘million,’ father?” she asked, with the simplicity of a child which thinks it can find out at once all that it wants to know."
"“百万？”葛朗台说，“嗨，就是一百万个二十苏，五个二十苏才是五法郎。”","“A million?” said Grandet, “why, it is a million pieces of twenty sous each, and it takes five twenty sous pieces to make five francs.”"
"“天哪！”欧仁妮叫了起来，“我叔父怎么可能有四百万呢？法国还有谁有这么多的百万？”葛朗台老头摸了摸他的下巴，笑了笑，他的肉瘤似乎胀大了些，“可是我的堂弟夏尔怎么办？”","“Dear me!” cried Eugenie, “how could my uncle possibly have had four millions?Is there any one else in France who ever had so many millions?”Pere Grandet stroked his chin, smiled, and his wen seemed to dilate.“But what will become of my cousin Charles?”"
"“按照他父亲的要求，他要到西印度去，他要在那里想办法发财。”","“He is going off to the West Indies by his father’s request, and he will try to make his fortune there.”"
"“他有钱去吗？”","“Has he got the money to go with?”"
"“我会给他路费的，一直到——是的，一直到南特的路费。”","“I shall pay for his journey as far as—yes, as far as Nantes.”"
"欧仁妮跳起来扑进了他的怀里。","Eugenie sprang into his arms."
"“哦，父亲，您真好！”","“Oh, father, how good you are!”"
"她吻着他，那亲热劲差一点儿让葛朗台为自己感到羞愧了，因为他的良心有些不安。","She kissed him with a warmth that almost made Grandet ashamed of himself, for his conscience galled him a little."
"“攒一百万要花费很长时间吗？”她问道。","“Will it take much time to amass a million?” she asked."
"“注意！”那个老守财奴说，“你知道一个拿破仑金币值多少吧？好，一百万就得五万拿破仑金币。”","“Look here!” said the old miser, “you know what a napoleon is?Well, it takes fifty thousand napoleons to make a million.”"
"“妈妈，我们得替他多念念《九日经》吧。”","“Mamma, we must say a great many @neuvaines@ for him.”"
"“我正这样想呢。”葛朗台太太说。","“I was thinking so,” said Madame Grandet."
"“又来了，总是花我的钱！”父亲吼道，“你们以为每个灌木枝上都有法郎啊？”","“That’s the way, always spending my money!” cried the father.“Do you think there are francs on every bush?”"
"这时一声低沉的哭泣声从顶楼传来，格外地凄惨，欧仁妮和她母亲的心打起了寒颤。","At this moment a muffled cry, more distressing than all the others, echoed through the garrets and struck a chill to the hearts of Eugenie and her mother."
"“娜农，上楼去，看看他不是要自杀吧，”葛朗台说，“喂，我说，”他又说道，一边看着妻子和女儿，她们听到他的话早已脸色发白，“你们俩不要胡说八道！我得走了，我得去应付那些荷兰人，他们今天要走了。接下来，我得去找克吕绍，跟他谈谈这件事。”","“Nanon, go upstairs and see that he does not kill himself,” said Grandet.“Now, then,” he added, looking at his wife and daughter, who had turned pale at his words, “no nonsense, you two!I must leave you; I have got to see about the Dutchmen who are going away today.And then I must find Cruchot, and talk with him about all this.”"
"他走了。等他一关上门，欧仁妮和她母亲便松了一口气。在这天早上之前，这个年轻的姑娘从没在父亲面前感到拘束过；但是在最近这几个小时里，她的感情和思想每一刻都在发生着变化。","He departed.As soon as he had shut the door Eugenie and her mother breathed more freely.Until this morning the young girl had never felt constrained in the presence of her father; but for the last few hours every moment wrought a change in her feelings and ideas."
"“妈妈，一桶葡萄酒值多少个金路易？”","“Mamma, how many louis are there in a cask of wine?”"
"“你父亲的酒是卖一百到一百五十法郎，有时两百——至少，我是听人这么说的。”","“Your father sells his from a hundred to a hundred and fifty francs, sometimes two hundred,—at least, so I’ve heard say.”"
"“那爸爸一定很有钱啦？”","“Then papa must be rich?”"
"“也许是的。但是克吕绍先生告诉我，他两年前买了弗罗瓦丰那块地，这一下他手头就紧了。”","“Perhaps he is.But Monsieur Cruchot told me he bought Froidfond two years ago; that may have pinched him.”"
"欧仁妮弄不明白她父亲财产的问题，她也就只能算到这个程度了。","Eugenie, not being able to understand the question of her father’s fortune, stopped short in her calculations."
"“他甚至都没看我一眼，那个宝贝儿！”娜农完成了差事返回来，说道，“他像个小牛一样，摊开身子趴在床上，哭得像圣女马德莱娜似的，上帝保佑！！这可怜的年轻人怎么啦！”","“He didn’t even see me, the darling!” said Nanon, coming back from her errand.“He’s stretched out like a calf on his bed and crying like the Madeleine, and that’s a blessing!What’s the matter with the poor dear young man!”"
"“咱们去安慰安慰他，妈妈，如果有人敲门，咱们可以下来。”","“Let us go and console him, mamma; if any one knocks, we can come down.”"
"葛朗台太太听到女儿悦耳的声音以及劝说的口吻，没了主意。欧仁妮是高尚的：她已经变成得成熟了。两个人上楼去了夏尔的房间，心都怦怦直跳。门开着。那个年轻人什么都没听到，什么也没看到，他沉浸在悲痛之中，只是发着不成调的哭号。","Madame Grandet was helpless against the sweet persuasive tones of her daughter’s voice.Eugenie was sublime: she had become a woman.The two, with beating hearts, went up to Charles’s room.The door was open.The young man heard and saw nothing; plunged in grief, he only uttered inarticulate cries."
"“他是多么爱他父亲呀！”欧仁妮低声说。","“How he loves his father!” said Eugenie in a low voice."
"从这些话语中，不难看出她内心的希望已经不知不觉突然变得强烈起来。葛朗台太太慈爱地看了女儿一眼，然后凑到她耳边低声说，——","In the utterance of those words it was impossible to mistake the hopes of a heart that, unknown to itself, had suddenly become passionate.Madame Grandet cast a mother’s look upon her daughter, and then whispered in her ear,—"
"“当心，你会爱上他的！”","“Take care, you will love him!”"
"“爱上他！”欧仁妮回答，“啊！要是您知道我父亲跟克吕绍先生说的话，就不会这么说了。”","“Love him!” answered Eugenie.“Ah! If you did but know what my father said to Monsieur Cruchot.”"
"夏尔翻了个身，看见了伯母和堂姐。","Charles turned over, and saw his aunt and cousin."
"“我失去了我的父亲，我可怜的父亲！要是他把藏在心里的麻烦告诉我，我们可以一起想法子补救的。天哪！我可怜的父亲！我本以为可以再见到他的，现在想起来我当时吻他的时候，真是太冷淡了——”","“I have lost my father, my poor father!If he had told me his secret troubles we might have worked together to repair them.My God! My poor father!I was so sure I should see him again that I think I kissed him quite coldly—” "
"他哽咽得说不下去了。","Sobs cut short the words."
"“我们会为他祈祷的。”葛朗台太太说，“服从上帝的旨意吧。”","“We will pray for him,” said Madame Grandet.“Resign yourself to the will of God.”"
"“堂弟，”欧仁妮说，“振作点！你的损失是无法挽回了，所以只能想想如何保全你的名誉吧。”","“Cousin,” said Eugenie, “take courage!Your loss is irreparable; therefore think only of saving your honor.”"
"凭着女人天生面面俱到、心思细腻的本能，欧仁妮即使在安慰人的时候，也尽力让堂弟多关心他自己，以减轻他的痛苦。","With the delicate instinct of a woman who intuitively puts her mind into all things, even at the moment when she offers consolation, Eugenie sought to cheat her cousin’s grief by turning his thoughts inward upon himself."
"“我的名誉？”年轻人从床上坐起来，将胳膊交叉在胸前，不耐烦地将头发往一边一甩，高声叫道，“啊！的确。我伯父说我父亲破产了。”他发出撕心裂肺的哭喊，用手蒙住了脸，“走开，走开，堂姐！天哪！天哪！饶恕我的父亲吧，因为他一定也痛苦极了！”","“My honor?” exclaimed the young man, tossing aside his hair with an impatient gesture as he sat up on his bed and crossed his arms.“Ah! That is true.My uncle said my father had failed.”He uttered a heart-rending cry, and hid his face in his hands.“Leave me, leave me, cousin!My God! My God! Forgive my father, for he must have suffered sorely!”"
"这个年轻人的痛苦如此真诚，没有心计，无所顾忌，真是让人十分感动。心地纯朴的欧仁妮母女完全明白那是一种真正的痛苦，所以当夏尔示意她们离开要独自呆着时，她们服从了。她们默默地下了楼，坐到窗前各自习惯坐的位置上，做了将近一个小时的针线活，期间没有交谈一句。欧仁妮凭着那种少女眨一下眼睛就什么都能看清的眼力，偷偷看了一下那个年轻人的屋子，便瞥见了他那精致的梳洗用品、他的剪子，还有他镶金的剃刀。在堂弟悲痛的气氛中闪现出的这番奢华气派，也许是由于反差太大，只能让她觉得堂弟更值得关心了。过去从来没有一个如此严重的事件，一个如此富于戏剧性的场面，触动过这两个安分守己的人的想象力，她们迄今为止一直生活在平静和孤寂之中。","There was something terribly attractive in the sight of this young sorrow, sincere without reasoning or afterthought.It was a virgin grief which the simple hearts of Eugenie and her mother were fitted to comprehend, and they obeyed the sign Charles made them to leave him to himself.They went downstairs in silence and took their accustomed places by the window and sewed for nearly an hour without exchanging a word.Eugenie had seen in the furtive glance that she cast about the young man’s room—that girlish glance which sees all in the twinkling of an eye—the pretty trifles of his dressing-case, his scissors, his razors embossed with gold.This gleam of luxury across her cousin’s grief only made him the more interesting to her, possibly by way of contrast.Never before had so serious an event, so dramatic a sight, touched the imaginations of these two passive beings, hitherto sunk in the stillness and calm of solitude."
"“妈妈，”欧仁妮说，“我们应该给我叔父戴孝吧。”","“Mamma,” said Eugenie, “we must wear mourning for my uncle.”"
"“这事由你父亲作主。”葛朗台太太回答。","“Your father will decide that,” answered Madame Grandet."
"她们又不做声了。欧仁妮一针一针地缝着，那有规律的动作向旁观者透露出她冥想之中的万千思绪。这姑娘心里的第一个愿望就是跟她堂弟一起服丧。","They relapsed into silence.Eugenie drew her stitches with a uniform motion which revealed to an observer the teeming thoughts of her meditation.The first desire of the girl’s heart was to share her cousin’s mourning."
"第六章","Chapter VI "
"大约四点钟，突然一阵敲门声把葛朗台太太吓得心惊肉跳。","About four o’clock an abrupt knock at the door struck sharply on the heart of Madame Grandet."
"“你父亲出了什么事？”她对女儿说。","“What can have happened to your father?” she said to her daughter."
"葛朗台兴冲冲地走了进来。他把手套摘了下来，用力地搓着手，倘若他的手皮没有像俄罗斯皮革一样上过硝、加工处理过的话，简直都要把皮搓下来了——当然，只差松木香和熏香的味道了。不一会儿，他道出了秘密。","Grandet entered joyously.After taking off his gloves, he rubbed his hands hard enough to take off their skin as well, if his epidermis had not been tanned and cured like Russia leather,—saving, of course, the perfume of larch-trees and incense.Presently his secret escaped him."
"“太太，”他说，一点儿也不结巴，“我把他们全都骗了！咱们的酒卖掉了！荷兰人和比利时人已经走了。我在他们客栈前的市场上溜达，假装无所事事的样子。那个比利时人——你知道我说的是谁——冲我走过来。那些葡萄成色不错的园主都压着货，打算观望，那好，我不拦着他们。我看得出来，比利时人慌了。很快，买卖成交。他买了我的酒，两百法郎一桶，一半付现。他给我付的是金币，单子签了。这是给你的六个金路易。三个月之内，酒价准跌。”","“Wife,” he said, without stuttering, “I’ve trapped them all!Our wine is sold!The Dutch and the Belgians have gone.I walked about the market-place in front of their inn, pretending to be doing nothing.That Belgian fellow—you know who I mean—came up to me.The owners of all the good vineyards have kept back their vintages, intending to wait; well, I didn’t hinder them.The Belgian was in despair; I saw that.In a minute the bargain was made.He takes my vintage at two hundred francs the puncheon, half down.He paid me in gold; the notes are drawn.Here are six louis for you.In three months wines will have fallen.”"
"他说这些话时的语气很平静，但带有很强的挖苦意味。索米尔的居民们这时正聚集在市场上，得知葛朗台刚刚将酒抛售的消息，他们都震惊了，倘若听到上面这番话，一定会气得发抖。他们的恐慌可能会使酒价马上下跌百分之五十。","These words, uttered in a quiet tone of voice, were nevertheless so bitterly sarcastic that the inhabitants of Saumur, grouped at this moment in the market-place and overwhelmed by the news of the sale Grandet had just effected, would have shuddered had they heard them.Their panic would have brought the price of wines down fifty per cent at once."
"“父亲，您今年有一千桶酒吧？”","“Did you have a thousand puncheons this year, father?”"
"“是的，小乖乖。”","“Yes, little one.”"
"用这个词称呼女儿表示老吝啬鬼高兴到了极点。","That term applied to his daughter was the superlative expression of the old miser’s joy."
"“那就会赚二十万个二十苏了？”","“Then that makes two hundred thousand pieces of twenty sous each?”"
"“是的，葛朗台小姐。”","“Yes, Mademoiselle Grandet.”"
"“那么，父亲，您很容易就能帮上夏尔了。”","“Then, father, you can easily help Charles.”"
"当初巴比伦国王伯沙撒看到眼前“算-量-分”几个字时的惊讶、愤怒、愕然都无法跟葛朗台冷淡的恼火相比，他本来早已忘了他的侄子，现在却发现侄子竟盘踞在他女儿的心中，女儿竟然在替他做着打算。","The amazement, the anger, the stupefaction of Belshazzar when he saw the @Mene-Tekel-Upharsin@ before his eyes is not to be compared with the cold rage of Grandet, who, having forgotten his nephew, now found him enshrined in the heart and calculations of his daughter."
"“这是怎么回事？自从那个公子哥踏进我的家门，就全都乱套了！你们的举动，就好像你们有权去买糖果、摆宴席，甚至操办婚礼似的。我不允许有这种事。到了我这把年纪，我相信我还明白自己的职责！我当然用不着女儿或其他什么人来教训我。为我侄儿该做什么，我自会做的，用不着你们插手。至于你，欧仁妮，”他脸冲着她，又说道，“别再提这个啦，不然我会把你和娜农一起送到努瓦耶修道院，看我做得到还是做不到；如果你不听我的话，最迟明天就把你送走！那小子在哪里，他下楼没有？”","“What’s this?Ever since that dandy put foot in my house everything goes wrong!You behave as if you had the right to buy sugar-plums and make feasts and weddings.I won’t have that sort of thing.I hope I know my duty at my time of life!I certainly sha’n’t take lessons from my daughter, or from anybody else.I shall do for my nephew what it is proper to do, and you have no need to poke your nose into it.As for you, Eugenie,” he added, facing her, “don’t speak of this again, or I’ll send you to the Abbaye des Noyers with Nanon, see if I don’t; and no later than to-morrow either, if you disobey me!Where is that fellow, has he come down yet?”"
"“没有，我的老伴。”葛朗台太太回答。","“No, my friend,” answered Madame Grandet."
"“那他在干什么？”","“What is he doing then?”"
"“他在为他父亲哭泣呢。”欧仁妮说。","“He is weeping for his father,” said Eugenie."
"葛朗台看着女儿，想不出来话说；毕竟，他是个父亲。他在屋子里转了几个来回，然后匆匆去了他的密室，琢磨他正在谋划的投资买公债的事。连根砍掉的那两千英亩林木让他赚了六十万法郎：这个数目再加上卖杨树赚的钱，以及他去年和今年的其他收入，他总收入累计达九十万法郎，这还不算刚刚成交的那笔二十万法郎的买卖。克吕绍向他保证，短期内他就会从公债赚取百分之二十的利息，当时公债报价是七十法郎一股，这对他很有诱惑力。在那张报道他兄弟死讯的报纸的页边上，他做着计算。虽然一直能听到他侄子的呻吟，但他却充耳不闻。娜农来了，敲墙请他吃晚饭。下楼走到最后一级楼梯时，他心里想——","Grandet looked at his daughter without finding a word to say; after all, he was a father.He made a couple of turns up and down the room, and then went hurriedly to his secret den to think over an investment he was meditating in the public Funds.The thinning out of his two thousand acres of forest land had yielded him six hundred thousand francs: putting this sum to that derived from the sale of his poplars and to his other gains for the last year and for the current year, he had amassed a total of nine hundred thousand francs, without counting the two hundred thousand he had got by the sale just concluded.The twenty per cent which Cruchot assured him would gain in a short time from the Funds, then quoted at seventy, tempted him.He figured out his calculation on the margin of the newspaper which gave the account of his brother’s death, all the while hearing the moans of his nephew, but without listening to them.Nanon came and knocked on the wall to summon him to dinner.On the last step of the staircase he was saying to himself as he came down,—"
"“这买卖我要做，我会得到百分之八的利息。两年以后，我就会有一百五十万法郎了，那时我就换成金币取出来——哎，我侄儿在哪里？”","“I’ll do it; I shall get eight per cent interest.In two years I shall have fifteen hundred thousand francs, which I will then draw out in good gold,—Well, where’s my nephew?”"
"“他说他什么也不想吃，”娜农回答，“那对他的身体可不好。”","“He says he doesn’t want anything to eat,” answered Nanon, “that’s not good for him.”"
"“省下不少呢。”她的主人回嘴说。","“So much saved,” retorted her master."
"“那倒是。”她说。","“That’s so,” she said."
"“呸！他不会哭多久的。饥饿会把狼赶出树林的。”","“Bah! He won’t cry long.Hunger drives the wolves out of the woods.”"
"吃晚饭时，静悄悄的。","The dinner was eaten in silence."
"“我的好老伴，”等桌布撤走后，葛朗台太太说，“咱们得戴孝吧。”","“My good friend,” said Madame Grandet, when the cloth was removed, “we must put on mourning.”"
"“说实在话，葛朗台太太！接下来，你还要想出什么新花样来花钱呢？戴孝在于心，而不在于衣服。”","“Upon my word, Madame Grandet! what will you invent next to spend money on?Mourning is in the heart, and not in the clothes.”"
"“可是为兄弟戴孝是必不可少的；教堂指示我们要——”","“But mourning for a brother is indispensable; and the Church commands us to—” "
"“用你那六个金路易买你的孝服去吧。给我个黑帽带就行了。”","“Buy your mourning out of your six louis.Give me a hat-band; that’s enough for me.”"
"欧仁妮抬头望着天，一句话不说。她慷慨的本性一直处于休眠中，并长期被压抑着，但是现在突然而且是第一次觉醒了，却时时刻刻都在受着伤害。这一夜表面上和他们单调生活中其他上千个夜晚过得没什么两样，但肯定是最可怕的一夜。欧仁妮头也不抬地做着针线活，没有用前一晚夏尔瞧不上眼的那个针线盒。葛朗台太太织着她的套袖。葛朗台把大拇指晃了四个小时，埋头盘算着，这番盘算的结果第二天会让索米尔人大吃一惊。那天没有人上门拜访。满城都在盛传着葛朗台刚刚玩的生意把戏、他兄弟的破产，还有他侄子的到来。出于就共同利益唠叨一番的愿望，索米尔所有上层和中层阶级的葡萄园主都聚集到德格拉桑先生家，对那位前市长破口大骂，厉声斥责。娜农在纺线，纺轮的嗡嗡声是寂静的大厅那灰色的楼板下仅有的声响。","Eugenie raised her eyes to heaven without uttering a word.Her generous instincts, slumbering and long repressed but now suddenly and for the first time awakened, were galled at every turn.The evening passed to all appearance like a thousand other evenings of their monotonous life, yet it was certainly the most horrible.Eugenie sewed without raising her head, and did not use the workbox which Charles had despised the night before.Madame Grandet knitted her sleeves.Grandet twirled his thumbs for four hours, absorbed in calculations whose results were on the morrow to astonish Saumur.No one came to visit the family that day.The whole town was ringing with the news of the business trick just played by Grandet, the failure of his brother, and the arrival of his nephew.Obeying the desire to gossip over their mutual interests, all the upper and middle-class wine-growers in Saumur met at Monsieur des Grassins, where terrible imprecations were being fulminated against the ex-mayor.Nanon was spinning, and the whirr of her wheel was the only sound heard beneath the gray rafters of that silent hall."
"“咱们不浪费口舌。”她说着，露出了她的牙齿，那牙齿像剥了皮的杏仁一样，又大又白。","“We don’t waste our tongues,” she said, showing her teeth, as large and white as peeled almonds."
"“什么都不应该浪费。”葛朗台从沉思中惊醒，回答道。他仿佛远远看到了三年后的八百万，而他正在一大片金子中航行。“咱们去睡吧。我代你们跟我侄儿道声晚安，看看他是不是要吃点东西。”","“Nothing should be wasted,” answered Grandet, rousing himself from his reverie.He saw a perspective of eight millions in three years, and he was sailing along that sheet of gold.“Let us go to bed.I will bid my nephew good-night for the rest of you, and see if he will take anything.”"
"葛朗台太太一直站在二楼的楼梯口，想听听老头和他侄子会谈些什么。欧仁妮比她母亲胆子大，朝上走了两级楼梯。","Madame Grandet remained on the landing of the first storey to hear the conversation that was about to take place between the goodman and his nephew.Eugenie, bolder than her mother, went up two stairs."
"“唉，侄儿，你遭遇了不幸。好吧，哭吧，那是人之常情。父亲就是父亲，可是我们必须耐心地忍受我们的苦难。我是你的好伯父，记住这个。来，振作起来！你想喝一小杯葡萄酒吗？”（在索米尔，葡萄酒一钱不值，他们请人喝葡萄酒就像在中国请人喝茶一样。）“嗨！”葛朗台又说，“你没点灯！这不好，很不好，做事情你得看清才行。”说着，他向壁炉台走去。“这是什么？”他叫了起来，“一支白蜡烛！她们是怎么搞来的白蜡烛？为了给这小子煮鸡蛋，那几个败家子简直会拆了我屋子的天花板。”","“Well, nephew, you are in trouble.Yes, weep, that’s natural.A father is a father; but we must bear our troubles patiently.I am a good uncle to you, remember that.Come, take courage!Will you have a little glass of wine?”(Wine costs nothing in Saumur, and they offer it as tea is offered in China.)“Why!” added Grandet, “you have got no light!That’s bad, very bad; you ought to see what you are about,” and he walked to the chimney-piece.“What’s this?” he cried.“A wax candle!How the devil did they filch a wax candle?The spendthrifts would tear down the ceilings of my house to boil the fellow’s eggs.”"
"听到这句话，母女俩急忙回到她们的房间，钻到床上，速度之快，就好像受惊的耗子跑回洞一样。","Hearing these words, mother and daughter slipped back into their rooms and burrowed in their beds, with the celerity of frightened mice getting back to their holes."
"“葛朗台太太，你是不是发现了宝藏？”男人说着，进了他妻子的卧室。","“Madame Grandet, have you found a mine?” said the man, coming into the chamber of his wife."
"“等等，我的朋老伴，我正在做祷告。”那可怜的母亲声音颤抖地说道。","“My friend, wait; I am saying my prayers,” said the poor mother in a trembling voice."
"“让你仁慈的上帝见鬼去吧！”葛朗台怒冲冲地答道。","“The devil take your good God!” growled Grandet in reply."
"守财奴不相信来世，当下就是他们的全部。这种思想反映了我们当今这个时代一个可怕的事实：在这个时代，金钱左右着法律、政治和道德风尚，其程度超过了以往任何一个时代。制度、书籍、人和教条都合谋破坏对来世的信念——一个一千八百年来社会大厦赖以支撑的信念。坟墓作为一个过渡手段，在我们这个时代无人惧怕。未来曾经在安魂弥撒之后向我们敞开，今天已被移放到现在。不管手段是否正当，为了获得穷奢极欲的尘世天堂，为了稍纵即逝的财富，不惜把心肠变硬、把肉体变得消瘦，就像过去的殉道者为了达到极乐世界而受尽苦难一样，如今这是一种很普遍的想法——一种到处写遍的想法，甚至写进了法律，法律问立法者，“你付多少钱？”而不是“你是怎么想的？”","Misers have no belief in a future life; the present is their all in all.This thought casts a terrible light upon our present epoch, in which, far more than at any former period, money sways the laws and politics and morals.Institutions, books, men, and dogmas, all conspire to undermine belief in a future life,—a belief upon which the social edifice has rested for eighteen hundred years.The grave, as a means of transition, is little feared in our day.The future, which once opened to us beyond the requiems, has now been imported into the present.To obtain @per fas et nefas@ a terrestrial paradise of luxury and earthly enjoyment, to harden the heart and macerate the body for the sake of fleeting possessions, as the martyrs once suffered all things to reach eternal joys, this is now the universal thought—a thought written everywhere, even in the very laws which ask of the legislator, “What do you pay?” instead of asking him, “What do you think?”"
"当这种信条从资产阶级传至平民百姓时，国家将变成什么样？","When this doctrine has passed down from the bourgeoisie to the populace, where will this country be?"
"“葛朗台太太，你做完了吗？”老头问。","“Madame Grandet, have you done?” asked the old man."
"“我的老伴，我正在为你祈祷。”","“My friend, I am praying for you.”"
"“很好！晚安，明天早上我们再谈。”","“Very good!Good night; tomorrow morning we will have a talk.”"
"那可怜的女人去睡觉了，像个没有学好功课的学生一样，知道他第二天会看到老师生气的面孔。正当她战战兢兢地用床单蒙上头，好什么也听不到的时候，欧仁妮穿着睡衣，光着脚，跑到她的身边，吻了吻她的额头。","The poor woman went to sleep like a schoolboy who, not having learned his lessons, knows he will see his master’s angry face on the morrow.At the moment when, filled with fear, she was drawing the sheet above her head that she might stifle hearing, Eugenie, in her night-gown and with naked feet, ran to her side and kissed her brow."
"“哦！我的好妈妈，”她说，“明天我会告诉他是我干的。”","“Oh! My good mother,” she said, “tomorrow I will tell him it was I.”"
"“不，他会把你送到努瓦耶的。让我来对付吧，他总不能吃了我。”","“No; he would send you to Noyers.Leave me to manage it; he cannot eat me.”"
"“您听到了吗，妈妈？”","“Do you hear, mamma?”"
"“什么？”","“What?”"
"“他还在哭呢。”","“He is weeping still.”"
"“去睡吧，女儿，你的脚会着凉的：地板很潮。”","“Go to bed, my daughter; you will take cold in your feet: the floor is damp.”"
"这阴沉的一天就这样过去了，它注定将会重重压在这位富有而又可怜的女继承人的整个一生当中，从这一刻起，她的睡眠再也不会那么踏实，也不会那么单纯了。实际上，人生的某些行为，虽然千真万确，却往往像是不可能的。这难道不是因为对于我们一时冲动而做出的决定，我们总是不从心理角度加以分析，而没有对那些神秘地促使我们大脑作出决断的微妙原因作出解释吗？也许欧仁妮深层的激情应该从她身体最微妙的品格中去分析。爱挖苦的人可能会说，那激情已变成了一种病态，影响了她的终生。很多人宁可否认结局，而不愿衡量精神现象中事物之间暗中相互关联的关系、环节和结合力的力量有多大。因而，欧仁妮过去的生活将为那些善于观察人类本性的人们提供一种解释，道明她不假思索的天真和突如其来的真情流露的缘由。她过去的生活越平静，她女性的怜悯心就越明显，她灵魂中生发的情感就越纯朴。","Thus passed the solemn day which was destined to weight upon the whole life of the rich and poor heiress, whose sleep was never again to be so calm, nor yet so pure, as it had been up to this moment.It often happens that certain actions of human life seem, literally speaking, improbable, though actual.Is not this because we constantly omit to turn the stream of psychological light upon our impulsive determinations, and fail to explain the subtile reasons, mysteriously conceived in our minds, which impelled them?Perhaps Eugenie’s deep passion should be analyzed in its most delicate fibres; for it became, scoffers might say, a malady which influenced her whole existence.Many people prefer to deny results rather than estimate the force of ties and links and bonds, which secretly join one fact to another in the moral order.Here, therefore, Eugenie’s past life will offer to observers of human nature an explanation of her naive want of reflection and the suddenness of the emotions which overflowed her soul.The more tranquil her life had been, the more vivid was her womanly pity, the more simple-minded were the sentiments now developed in her soul."
"她被白天发生的事情搅得焦躁不安，隔一会儿醒一次，聆听堂弟的动静，总觉得听到了哀叹声，那哀叹声仍旧回荡在她的心中。有时，她看见他悲痛欲绝，有时，她梦见他饿晕过去。快天亮的时候，她确信自己听到了一声骇人的哭号。她马上穿上衣服，在熹微的晨光中，快步向堂弟的卧室跑去，他的房门没关。蜡烛已经燃到了烛盘。夏尔疲倦之极，正睡着，他穿着衣服坐在床边一把扶手椅上，头靠着床，像空腹睡觉的人那样在做着梦。欧仁妮尽可以哭个痛快，尽可以欣赏那张年轻而英俊的脸，那张脸印着痛苦留下的痕迹，双眼哭肿了，虽然睡着，却似乎还在流着泪。夏尔心里感应到了姑娘的到来，他睁开双眼，看见她正一脸同情地看着自己。","Made restless by the events of the day, she woke at intervals to listen to her cousin, thinking she heard the sighs which still echoed in her heart.Sometimes she saw him dying of his trouble, sometimes she dreamed that he fainted from hunger.Towards morning she was certain that she heard a startling cry.She dressed at once and ran, in the dawning light, with a swift foot to her cousin’s chamber, the door of which he had left open.The candle had burned down to the socket.Charles, overcome by nature, was sleeping, dressed and sitting in an armchair beside the bed, on which his head rested; he dreamed as men dream on an empty stomach.Eugenie might weep at her ease; she might admire the young and handsome face blotted with grief, the eyes swollen with weeping, that seemed, sleeping as they were, to well forth tears.Charles felt sympathetically the young girl’s presence; he opened his eyes and saw her pitying him."
"“对不起，堂姐。”他说，显然既不知道时辰，也不知道身在何处。","“Pardon me, my cousin,” he said, evidently not knowing the hour nor the place in which he found himself."
"“有几颗心听到了你的声音，堂弟，我们觉得你可能需要点什么。你应该上床去睡，这样坐着多累呀。”","“There are hearts who hear you, cousin, and @we@ thought you might need something.You should go to bed; you tire yourself by sitting thus.”"
"“那倒是。”","“That is true.”"
"“那好吧，再见！”","“Well, then, adieu!”"
"她逃了出去，为自己去了那里又害臊又高兴。只有天真无邪才敢这么冒失。一旦开了窍，美德和邪恶一样会让她工于算计。欧仁妮在堂弟身边没有发抖，等回了自己的卧室，却几乎站都站不住了。她无知的生活突然结束了，她思来想去，把自己着实痛斥了一通。","She escaped, ashamed and happy at having gone there.Innocence alone can dare to be so bold.Once enlightened, virtue makes her calculations as well as vice.Eugenie, who had not trembled beside her cousin, could scarcely stand upon her legs when she regained her chamber.Her ignorant life had suddenly come to an end; she reasoned, she rebuked herself with many reproaches."
"“他会怎么看我呀？他会以为我爱上了他！”","“What will he think of me?He will think that I love him!”"
"其实她倒最希望他这样去想。真诚的爱情自有预感，知道爱能产生爱。这个独处闺阁的可怜姑娘就这样跑进了一个青年男子的卧室，这是何等大事啊！在恋爱期间，有些思想和行为对某些心灵而言，不就完全意味着最神圣的婚约吗？一个小时后，她去了母亲那里，和平常一样服侍母亲穿衣。然后她们两人下了楼，坐在窗前的老地方等葛朗台，内心极为焦虑不安，正如一个人在害怕某个场面或是担心受罚时，心里或者发冷，或者发热，或者揪紧，或者膨胀，全看个人的性格而定。这种情绪很自然，甚至连家畜都会有，尽管不小心自己伤了自己时，它们可以一声不哼，但惩罚当中的丝毫疼痛都会让它们哀号起来。","That was what she most wished him to think.An honest love has its own prescience, and knows that love begets love.What an event for this poor solitary girl thus to have entered the chamber of a young man!Are there not thoughts and actions in the life of love which to certain souls bear the full meaning of the holiest espousals?An hour later she went to her mother and dressed her as usual.Then they both came down and sat in their places before the window waiting for Grandet, with that cruel anxiety which, according to the individual character, freezes the heart or warms it, shrivels or dilates it, when a scene is feared, a punishment expected,—a feeling so natural that even domestic animals possess it, and whine at the slightest pain of punishment, though they make no outcry when they inadvertently hurt themselves."
"老头下来了，但是他若无其事地跟妻子说着话，吻了吻欧仁妮，然后坐到桌上，看来好像忘了前一晚他威胁的话。","The goodman came down; but he spoke to his wife with an absent manner, kissed Eugenie, and sat down to table without appearing to remember his threats of the night before."
"“我的侄儿怎么样了？那家伙倒是不烦人。”","“What has become of my nephew?The lad gives no trouble.”"
"“先生，他睡着呢。”娜农回答。","“Monsieur, he is asleep,” answered Nanon."
"“这样再好不过了；他睡着的话，就用不着白蜡烛了。”葛朗台用讥讽的语气说道。","“So much the better; he won’t want a wax candle,” said Grandet in a jeering tone."
"这种反常的宽大，这番挖苦人的高兴劲，让葛朗台太太很是惊讶，她专心地看着丈夫。老头——这里也许有必要解释一下，已经用来称呼葛朗台的“老头”这个词，在图赖讷、安茹、普瓦图和布列塔尼，经常用来指苛刻残忍的人，同样也用于指性情和善的人，只要他们到了一定的年岁，这个称呼和一个人的仁慈的程度毫无关系——老头拿起他的帽子和手套，一边往外走，一边说道——","This unusual clemency, this bitter gaiety, struck Madame Grandet with amazement, and she looked at her husband attentively.The goodman—here it may be well to explain that in Touraine, Anjou, Pitou, and Bretagne the word “goodman,” already used to designate Grandet, is bestowed as often upon harsh and cruel men as upon those of kindly temperament, when either have reached a certain age; the title means nothing on the score of individual gentleness—the goodman took his hat and gloves, saying as he went out,—"
"“我要到市场去转转，找克吕绍。”","“I am going to loiter about the market-place and find Cruchot.”"
"“欧仁妮，你父亲心里一定有事。”","“Eugenie, your father certainly has something on his mind.”"
"葛朗台是个觉少的人，夜里一半时间都用在初步盘算上，这些盘算使他的见解、观察和计划都惊人地准确，从没失过手，他的同乡们看着都惊叹不已。人类的所有能力都是时间和耐心的混合体。强者既有意志力，又善于等待时机。一个守财奴的生活就是不断地把人类的能力用在为自己服务上。这只依赖于两种情感——自恋和利己主义，但是利己主义在一定程度上就是切切实实而又明智的自恋，是真正优越感的明显的表现，所以说自恋和利己主义是同一整体——以自我为中心的两个方面。也许正因为如此，每当守财奴的生活习惯被展现在世人面前时，人们总是表现出极大的好奇心。每个人的本性都与这些人物一脉相通，他们把全部的感情集中于一种激情之中，向人类所有的情感发出了挑战。哪里有全无欲望的人？哪里有不靠金钱便能满足的社会欲望呢？","Grandet, who was a poor sleeper, employed half his nights in the preliminary calculations which gave such astonishing accuracy to his views and observations and schemes, and secured to them the unfailing success at sight of which his townsmen stood amazed.All human power is a compound of time and patience.Powerful beings will and wait.The life of a miser is the constant exercise of human power put to the service of self.It rests on two sentiments only,—self-love and self-interest; but self-interest being to a certain extent compact and intelligent self-love, the visible sign of real superiority, it follows that self-love and self-interest are two parts of the same whole,—egotism.From this arises, perhaps, the excessive curiosity shown in the habits of a miser’s life whenever they are put before the world.Every nature holds by a thread to those beings who challenge all human sentiments by concentrating all in one passion.Where is the man without desire? And what social desire can be satisfied without money?"
"用他妻子的话说，葛朗台的确是“心里有事”。像所有的守财奴一样，他内心一直有种强烈的愿望，就是想跟其他人在商业上耍耍花招，并合法地把他们的钱都赚过来。对他来说，欺骗别人就是一种能力的标志，一个永久的证明，证明他赢得了蔑视世上那些任人宰割的弱者的权力。哦！有谁真正理解安静地躺在上帝脚下的羔羊呢？——它是尘世间一切牺牲者的最感人的象征，象征了他们虚幻的未来，以及他们被人歌颂的痛苦和懦弱。这羔羊正是守财奴养肥的，他把羔羊关进他的羊圈，宰杀，烹煮，吃掉，然后又加以蔑视。将金钱和蔑视混合在一起就是守财奴的牧草。夜里，葛朗台改变了主意，这就是他突然宽宏大量的原因。他想出了一个计谋，准备耍弄巴黎人，诱骗他们，愚弄他们，给他们设陷阱，让他们陷入圈套，叫他们跑来跑去、汗流浃背、满怀希望、脸色发白——一个令他这个外省的老箍桶匠开心的计谋，而他要么就坐在他阴暗的房椽下，要么踏着索米尔家中腐朽的楼梯上上下下。他满脑子都是他的侄子。他希望不用花他侄子或他自己一个子儿，就能挽救他亡弟的名声。他马上要放出自己的现金，准备投资三年，因而他只需管理索米尔的地产就可以了。他突然在他兄弟的破产中找到了自己的恶毒行为所需的养分。他觉得自己的利爪之间没有什么可榨取的东西，所以决定以夏尔的名义去压榨巴黎人，以最廉价的方式扮演一个好兄长的角色。家族的名誉在这个计划中一点儿也不重要，他的好意就好比一个赌徒对看一场他没有下注也能赢的赌博的兴趣。克吕绍叔侄是他计划中必不可少的一部分，但是他不愿意找他们——他决意要让他们来找他，并打算当晚上演一场喜剧，他已经构思好了情节，这会让他一分不花就能在第二天成为全城人羡慕的对象。","Grandet unquestionably “had something on his mind,” to use his wife’s expression.There was in him, as in all misers, a persistent craving to play a commercial game with other men and win their money legally.To impose upon other people was to him a sign of power, a perpetual proof that he had won the right to despise those feeble beings who suffer themselves to be preyed upon in this world.Oh! Who has ever truly understood the lamb lying peacefully at the feet of God?—Touching emblem of all terrestrial victims, myth of their future, suffering and weakness glorified!This lamb it is which the miser fattens, puts in his fold, slaughters, cooks, eats, and then despises.The pasture of misers is compounded of money and disdain.During the night Grandet’s ideas had taken another course, which was the reason of his sudden clemency.He had hatched a plot by which to trick the Parisians, to decoy and dupe and snare them, to drive them into a trap, and make them go and come and sweat and hope and turn pale,—a plot by which to amuse himself, the old provincial cooper, sitting there beneath his gloomy rafters, or passing up and down the rotten staircase of his house in Saumur.His nephew filled his mind.He wished to save the honor of his dead brother without the cost of a penny to the son or to himself.His own funds he was about to invest for three years; he had therefore nothing further to do than to manage his property in Saumur.He needed some nutriment for his malicious activity, and he found it suddenly in his brother’s failure.Feeling nothing to squeeze between his own paws, he resolved to crush the Parisians in behalf of Charles, and to play the part of a good brother on the cheapest terms.The honor of the family counted for so little in this scheme that his good intentions might be likened to the interest a gambler takes in seeing a game well played in which he has no stake.The Cruchots were a necessary part of his plan; but he would not seek them,—he resolved to make them come to him, and to lead up that very evening to a comedy whose plot he had just conceived, which should make him on the morrow an object of admiration to the whole town without its costing him a single penny."
"父亲不在家，欧仁妮很高兴可以公开为她非常心爱的堂弟忙前忙后，放心大胆地向他倾注满腔的怜悯。怜悯是女性崇高的优点，是唯一女性愿意承认的优点，也是唯一男人让女性发扬，而又不会不受到女性责难的优点。有三四次，这姑娘跑去听她堂弟的呼吸，想知道他是睡着还是醒着。之后，等他起了床，她又把心思转到了奶油、鸡蛋、水果、盘子和杯子上——他早餐中的所有东西都成了她特别关心的事情。最后，她轻捷地蹬着破旧的楼梯跑上去，听堂弟发出的响动。他是在穿衣服吗？他仍在哭吗？她来到了门前。","In her father’s absence Eugenie had the happiness of busying herself openly with her much-loved cousin, of spending upon him fearlessly the treasures of her pity,—woman’s sublime superiority, the sole she desires to have recognized, the sole she pardons man for letting her assume.Three or four times the young girl went to listen to her cousin’s breathing, to know if he were sleeping or awake; then, when he had risen, she turned her thoughts to the cream, the eggs, the fruits, the plates, the glasses,—all that was a part of his breakfast became the object of some special care.At length she ran lightly up the old staircase to listen to the noise her cousin made.Was he dressing?Did he still weep?She reached the door."
"“堂弟！”","“My cousin!”"
"“怎么了，堂姐。”","“Yes, cousin.”"
"“你早餐是到楼下吃，还是在你的房间吃？”","“Will you breakfast downstairs, or in your room?”"
"“在哪里都行。”","“Where you like.”"
"“你感觉怎么样？”","“How do you feel?”"
"“亲爱的堂姐，很惭愧，我饿了。”","“Dear cousin, I am ashamed of being hungry.”"
"这番交谈隔着紧闭的房门，在欧仁妮看来，简直就像诗歌中的一个片段。","This conversation, held through the closed door, was like an episode in a poem to Eugenie."
"“好，那我们就把早餐送到你的房间里，免得惹我父亲生气。”","“Well, then, we will bring your breakfast to your own room, so as not to annoy my father.”"
"她跑到厨房，像小鸟一样快，一样轻盈。","She ran to the kitchen with the swiftness and lightness of a bird."
"“娜农，去收拾他的房间！”","“Nanon, go and do his room!”"
"那楼梯被践踏得太频繁了，一点儿声音都会发出回响，此时在欧仁妮眼里却不再显得破旧了。它变得亮堂堂的，它发出声音，跟她说话，像她一样年轻——像此时它正为之效劳的爱情一样年轻。她的母亲，她慈祥、宽容的母亲，甘愿为这孩子任性的爱情助一臂之力。在房间收拾妥当之后，两人坐到那个不幸的年轻人身边，陪着他。基督教的博爱不是把安慰当作一种职责吗？两个女人从宗教中找到很多似是而非的论点来为她们的行为辩解。夏尔得到了最温柔、最体贴的关怀。他悲伤的心感受到了那温馨的友情和贴心的同情所带来的甜蜜。那两颗灵魂曾长期被束缚压制着，当它们在苦海中——它们天然所属的领域——但凡有片刻自由的时候，便非常清楚如何表达这友情和同情。","That staircase, so often traversed, which echoed to the slightest noise, now lost its decaying aspect in the eyes of Eugenie.It grew luminous; it had a voice and spoke to her; it was young like herself,—young like the love it was now serving.Her mother, her kind, indulgent mother, lent herself to the caprices of the child’s love, and after the room was put in order, both went to sit with the unhappy youth and keep him company.Does not Christian charity make consolation a duty?The two women drew a goodly number of little sophistries from their religion wherewith to justify their conduct.Charles was made the object of the tenderest and most loving care.His saddened heart felt the sweetness of the gentle friendship, the exquisite sympathy which these two souls, crushed under perpetual restraint, knew so well how to display when, for an instant, they were left unfettered in the regions of suffering, their natural sphere."
"既然以至亲相称，欧仁妮便开始叠夏尔的内衣，把夏尔带来的洗漱用品都整理好。这样，她就可以尽情地欣赏每一件奢华的东西，以及各种各样镶金镂银的小玩意儿。以察看为借口，她把这些东西握在手里，久久不放。夏尔看到伯母和堂姐对他的盛情不禁深受感动，他非常了解巴黎社会，他敢肯定，以他目前的处境，他会遭到所有人的冷眼相待。于是在他的眼里，欧仁妮显得特别美，楚楚动人。前一天晚上，他还想嘲笑那种生活和风俗，从此以后他却赞赏起它们的纯朴了。所以，当欧仁妮从娜农手中接过盛着咖啡和奶油的碗，开始诚心诚意地为堂弟倒出来，并和蔼地看了他一眼的时候，这个巴黎人热泪盈眶，拉起她的手吻了吻。","Claiming the right of relationship, Eugenie began to fold the linen and put in order the toilet articles which Charles had brought; thus she could marvel at her ease over each luxurious bauble and the various knick-knacks of silver or chased gold, which she held long in her hand under a pretext of examining them.Charles could not see without emotion the generous interest his aunt and cousin felt in him; he knew society in Paris well enough to feel assured that, placed as he now was, he would find all hearts indifferent or cold.Eugenie thus appeared to him in the splendor of a special beauty, and from thenceforth he admired the innocence of life and manners which the previous evening he had been inclined to ridicule.So when Eugenie took from Nanon the bowl of coffee and cream, and began to pour it out for her cousin with the simplicity of real feeling, giving him a kindly glance, the eyes of the Parisian filled with tears; he took her hand and kissed it."
"“你怎么啦？”她说。","“What troubles you?” she said."
"“哦！这是感激的泪水。”他回答。","“Oh! These are tears of gratitude,” he answered."
"欧仁妮猛地转身走向壁炉台，去拿烛台。","Eugenie turned abruptly to the chimney-piece to take the candlesticks."
"“嘿，娜农，把它们拿走！”她说。","“Here, Nanon, carry them away!” she said."
"当她再看堂弟的时候，她的脸还红着，不过她的样子至少还能瞒过去人，并没有把她满心洋溢的狂喜给泄露出来；但是两个人的眼睛都表达着同样的情感，正如他们的心灵交融在同一个想法之中——未来是属于他们的。这番柔情对大难之中的夏尔来说倍感珍贵，因为它完全出乎意料。门锤的声音把女人们召回了原位。幸运的是，在葛朗台进来的时候，她们能够非常迅速地下楼，坐定，拿起活计；如果他在拱门下碰见了她们，他一定会起疑心的。老头儿站着吃完了午餐，这时弗罗瓦丰田庄的看管人来了，预先说好的津贴还没给他。他带来了园子里打来的一只野兔和几只山鹑，还有磨坊租户捎来抵租子用的几条鳗鱼和两条梭子鱼。","When she looked again towards her cousin she was still blushing, but her looks could at least deceive, and did not betray the excess of joy which innundated her heart; yet the eyes of both expressed the same sentiment as their souls flowed together in one thought,—the future was theirs.This soft emotion was all the more precious to Charles in the midst of his heavy grief because it was wholly unexpected.The sound of the knocker recalled the women to their usual station.Happily they were able to run downstairs with sufficient rapidity to be seated at their work when Grandet entered; had he met them under the archway it would have been enough to rouse his suspicions.After breakfast, which the goodman took standing, the keeper from Froidfond, to whom the promised indemnity had never yet been paid, made his appearance, bearing a hare and some partridges shot in the park, with eels and two pike sent as tribute by the millers."
"“哈，哈！可怜的科努瓦耶，他来了，像大斋节的鱼。那东西可以吃吗？”","“Ha, ha! Poor Cornoiller; here he comes, like fish in Lent.Is all that fit to eat?”"
"“是的，我厚道的好老爷，两天前打的。”","“Yes, my dear, generous master; it has been killed two days.”"
"“喂，娜农，快点，”葛朗台说，“把这些东西拿去，晚饭时吃。我已经请了两位克吕绍。”","“Come, Nanon, bestir yourself,” said Grandet, “take these things, they’ll do for dinner.I have invited the two Cruchots.”"
"娜农瞪大眼睛，惊呆了，看了看屋子里的每一个人。","Nanon opened her eyes, stupid with amazement, and looked at everybody in the room."
"“哎！”她说，“可我去哪里弄来猪油和香料呢？”","“Well!” she said, “and how am I to get the lard and the spices?”"
"“太太，”葛朗台说，“给娜农六法郎，记得提醒我去地窖拿些好酒。”","“Wife,” said Grandet, “give Nanon six francs, and remind me to get some of the good wine out of the cellar.”"
"“嗯，那么，葛朗台先生，”田庄看管人来时已预备好一套话以解决工钱问题，他说，“葛朗台先生——”","“Well, then, Monsieur Grandet,” said the keeper, who had come prepared with an harangue for the purpose of settling the question of the indemnity, “Monsieur Grandet—” "
"“得，得，得，得！”葛朗台说，“我知道你想说什么。你是个好伙计，我们明天再谈那件事，我今天太忙了。太太，给他五法郎。”他一边对葛朗台太太补充道，一边匆忙溜走了。","“Ta, ta, ta, ta!” said Grandet, “I know what you want to say.You are a good fellow; we will see about it tomorrow; I’m too busy today.Wife, give him five francs,” he added to Madame Grandet as he decamped."
"可怜的女人很高兴能以十一法郎的代价买个清静。她知道，葛朗台把给她的钱一个法郎一个法郎地要回去之后，会让她安生两个星期的。","The poor woman was only too happy to buy peace at the cost of eleven francs.She knew that Grandet would let her alone for a fortnight after he had thus taken back, franc by franc, the money he had given her."
"“喂，科努瓦耶，”她说着，把十个法郎塞到那男人的手中，“我们以后会给你工酬的。”","“Here, Cornoiller,” she said, slipping ten francs into the man’s hand, “some day we will reward your services.”"
"科努瓦耶无话可说，便起身走了。","Cornoiller could say nothing, so he went away."
"“太太，”娜农说，她已经戴上了她的黑头巾，挎上了篮子，“我只要三法郎。余下的您留着吧，总能想法对付过去的。”","“Madame,” said Nanon, who had put on her black coif and taken her basket, “I want only three francs.You keep the rest; it’ll go fast enough somehow.”"
"“晚饭做好点，娜农，我堂弟要下来。”欧仁妮说。","“Have a good dinner, Nanon; my cousin will come down,” said Eugenie."
"“要出大事了，我敢肯定，”葛朗台太太说，“这是我们结婚以来你父亲第三次请客。”","“Something very extraordinary is going on, I am certain of it,” said Madame Grandet.“This is only the third time since our marriage that your father has given a dinner.”"
"大约四点，欧仁妮和她母亲已经摆好了六个人吃饭的桌子，那位一家之主也把几瓶外省人特喜欢珍藏的好酒拿了上来后，夏尔下楼进了大厅。这个年轻人脸色苍白，他的姿态、他脸上的表情、他的目光，还有他说话的语气，都带着悲伤，但却不失优雅。他不是假装悲痛，他是实实在在地难过；那笼罩在他面孔上的痛苦使他的神情特别容易打动女人的心。欧仁妮因此更爱他了。或许她觉得是不幸把他拉得离自己更近了。夏尔不再是那个有钱的、高贵的、对她来说简直高不可攀的年轻人了，而是一个落入可怕的苦难之中的穷亲戚。苦难出平等。女人把救苦救难当成己任——在这点上和天使有共同之处。夏尔和欧仁妮彼此心有灵犀，只用眼神来交流，这个可怜的落难公子，没了父母，一贫如洗，他独自远远地坐在一个屋角，一言不发，沉默中透着高傲。不过，那个年轻姑娘温柔而爱抚的目光不时地落在他的身上，迫使他丢开愁绪，随着她一起进入希望和未来的天地，她愿意与他携手同游。","About four o’clock, just as Eugenie and her mother had finished setting the table for six persons, and after the master of the house had brought up a few bottles of the exquisite wine which provincials cherish with true affection, Charles came down into the hall.The young fellow was pale; his gestures, the expression of his face, his glance, and the tones of his voice, all had a sadness which was full of grace.He was not pretending grief, he truly suffered; and the veil of pain cast over his features gave him an interesting air dear to the heart of women.Eugenie loved him the more for it.Perhaps she felt that sorrow drew him nearer to her.Charles was no longer the rich and distinguished young man placed in a sphere far above her, but a relation plunged into frightful misery.Misery begets equality.Women have this in common with the angels,—suffering humanity belongs to them.Charles and Eugenie understood each other and spoke only with their eyes; for the poor fallen dandy, orphaned and impoverished, sat apart in a corner of the room, and was proudly calm and silent.Yet, from time to time, the gentle and caressing glance of the young girl shone upon him and constrained him away from his sad thoughts, drawing him with her into the fields of hope and of futurity, where she loved to hold him at her side."
"第七章","Chapter VII "
"此时，葛朗台宴请克吕绍叔侄一事轰动了索米尔城，其轰动效应超过了前一晚他出售葡萄酒的消息，尽管这一行为构成了对整个葡萄种植业背信弃义的罪行。如果这个老奸巨猾的守财奴请客吃饭，其目的和亚西比德割掉自家狗的尾巴一样，他也许可称之为一个伟人。可事实是，他自认为比不断被他玩弄于股掌之间的全城人都要高上一头，所以根本不在乎索米尔人会说什么。","At this moment the town of Saumur was more excited about the dinner given by Grandet to the Cruchots than it had been the night before at the sale of his vintage, though that constituted a crime of high-treason against the whole wine-growing community.If the politic old miser had given his dinner from the same idea that cost the dog of Alcibiades his tail, he might perhaps have been called a great man; but the fact is, considering himself superior to a community which he could trick on all occasions, he paid very little heed to what Saumur might say."
"德格拉桑家很快知道了纪尧姆·葛朗台破产和惨死的事，他们决定当晚去他们的老主顾家吊唁并慰问一番，目的是为了弄清他宴请克吕绍叔侄的动机。五点整，克·德蓬丰先生和他的公证人叔叔身着节日盛装来了。大家就座，开始津津有味地用起晚餐来。葛朗台很严肃，夏尔沉默着，欧仁妮一声不吭，而葛朗台太太比平时的话更少，如此一来，这顿晚餐倒真成了一个名副其实的丧宴。当他们起身离席时，夏尔对他的伯母和伯父说——","The des Grassins soon learned the facts of the failure and the violent death of Guillaume Grandet, and they determined to go to their client’s house that very evening to commiserate his misfortune and show him some marks of friendship, with a view of ascertaining the motives which had led him to invite the Cruchots to dinner.At precisely five o’clock Monsieur C. de Bonfons and his uncle the notary arrived in their Sunday clothes.The party sat down to table and began to dine with good appetites.Grandet was grave, Charles silent, Eugenie dumb, and Madame Grandet did not say more than usual; so that the dinner was, very properly, a repast of condolence.When they rose from table Charles said to his aunt and uncle,—"
"“能允许我离开吗？我有一封痛苦的长信要写。”","“Will you permit me to retire?I am obliged to undertake a long and painful correspondence.”"
"“当然可以，侄儿。”","“Certainly, nephew.”"
"等老头确定夏尔大概正在专心写信，什么也听不见的时候，他便用一种狡黠的眼神看着妻子，说道——","As soon as the goodman was certain that Charles could hear nothing and was probably deep in his letter-writing, he said, with a dissimulating glance at his wife,—"
"“葛朗台太太，我们要谈的话对你们来说就是拉丁文；现在七点半，你们可以去把家里的帐清一清。晚安，我的女儿。”","“Madame Grandet, what we have to talk about will be Latin to you; it is half past seven; you can go and attend to your household accounts.Good night, my daughter.”"
"他吻了吻欧仁妮，然后两个女人就离开了。一场好戏现在开演了，在这场戏里，葛朗台老头施展了比他生平任何时候都用得多的诡计多端、阴险狡诈，那是他与人打交道时学到的，那些被他有时咬得太狠的人因此给他起了个绰号“老狗”。如果这位索米尔市长野心再大点，又赶上好机会，使他能爬到社会上层，奉派出席讨论各国事务的会议，而且他又能把自私自利赋予他的天分用到那里，毫无疑问，他将会为他的祖国立下功勋的。但一离开索米尔，这老头可能就成了一个没用的可怜虫，这种可能同样也有。也许有才智的人们像某些动物一样，一离开生长的水土，便会停止繁殖。","He kissed Eugenie, and the two women departed.A scene now took place in which Pere Grandet brought to bear, more than at any other moment of his life, the shrewd dexterity he had acquired in his intercourse with men, and which had won him from those whose flesh he sometimes bit too sharply the nickname of “the old dog.”If the mayor of Saumur had carried his ambition higher still, if fortunate circumstances, drawing him towards the higher social spheres, had sent him into congresses where the affairs of nations were discussed, and had he there employed the genius with which his personal interests had endowed him, he would undoubtedly have proved nobly useful to his native land.Yet it is perhaps equally certain that outside of Saumur the goodman would have cut a very sorry figure.Possibly there are minds like certain animals which cease to breed when transplanted from the climates in which they are born."
"“庭-庭-庭长先-先-先生，您说-说破-破-破产——”","“M-m-mon-sieur le p-p-president, you said t-t-that b-b-bankruptcy—” "
"老守财奴常年来只要需要就装出的结巴，以及他在雨天有时加以抱怨的耳聋，在索米尔被大家认为是个天生的缺陷，但在这样一个危急关头，他的结巴令两位克吕绍非常厌烦，他们边听边下意识地做着鬼脸，动着嘴唇，好像要把他有意停顿和结巴的字眼给发出音来一样。","The stutter which for years the old miser had assumed when it suited him, and which, together with the deafness of which he sometimes complained in rainy weather, was thought in Saumur to be a natural defect, became at this crisis so wearisome to the two Cruchots that while they listened they unconsciously made faces and moved their lips, as if pronouncing the words over which he was hesitating and stuttering at will."
"这里不妨交代一下葛朗台先生口吃和耳聋的历史。在安茹，就数这个狡猾的老箍桶匠把法语（带安茹口音的）听得最清楚，说得最利落了，谁也比不上他。几年前，他尽管精明透顶，还是被一个犹太人给骗了。那人在谈生意时，为了听清别人说话，总把手放在耳朵后，说话时结结巴巴，根本表达不清意思，以致葛朗台发了善心，不得不为那个狡猾的犹太人提示他好像要找的字眼和想法，替那个犹太人把理由都补全了，把本该那个该死的犹太人自己说的话都给说了。总之，他成了那个犹太人，而不是葛朗台了。","Here it may be well to give the history of this impediment of the speech and hearing of Monsieur Grandet.No one in Anjou heard better, or could pronounce more crisply the French language (with an Angevin accent) than the wily old cooper.Some years earlier, in spite of his shrewdness, he had been taken in by an Israelite, who in the course of the discussion held his hand behind his ear to catch sounds, and mangled his meaning so thoroughly in trying to utter his words that Grandet fell a victim to his humanity and was compelled to prompt the wily Jew with the words and ideas he seemed to seek, to complete himself the arguments of the said Jew, to say what that cursed Jew ought to have said for himself; in short, to be the Jew instead of being Grandet."
"等箍桶匠结束了这场奇特的会面时，他已经达成了在长期的商业生涯中唯一一笔他有理由抱怨的买卖。可是，如果说他当时是金钱上受了损失，他在道德上却获得了一个宝贵的教训，后来，他还从中受了益。实际上，老头最后还感激那个犹太人，因为犹太人教会了他一门艺术，可以使商业对手沉不住气，并使商业对手因不耐烦而忘记自己的想法，反而为折磨他的人在打磕巴的地方作些提示。没有什么事比手头这件更需要耳聋、口吃，以及葛朗台为掩盖其想法而使用的所有那些莫名其妙的拐弯抹角了。首先，他不打算为自己的计划承担责任；其次，他决意要把持谈话的主动权，让人吃不准他的真正意图。","When the cooper came out of this curious encounter he had concluded the only bargain of which in the course of a long commercial life he ever had occasion to complain.But if he lost at the time pecuniarily, he gained morally a valuable lesson; later, he gathered its fruits.Indeed, the goodman ended by blessing that Jew for having taught him the art of irritating his commercial antagonist and leading him to forget his own thoughts in his impatience to suggest those over which his tormentor was stuttering.No affair had ever needed the assistance of deafness, impediments of speech, and all the incomprehensible circumlocutions with which Grandet enveloped his ideas, as much as the affair now in hand.In the first place, he did not mean to shoulder the responsibility of his own scheme; in the next, he was determined to remain master of the conversation and to leave his real intentions in doubt."
"“德蓬-蓬-蓬丰先-先-先生，”——三年来，葛朗台第二次叫克吕绍的侄子德蓬丰先生；庭长觉得自己可能被这个刁钻古怪的老家伙当作女婿了——“您-您说那-那-那个破-破-破产可-可-可能在某些情-情-情况下，被-被-被阻-阻-阻止，由-由-由——”","“M-m-monsieur de B-B-Bonfons,”—for the second time in three years Grandet called the Cruchot nephew Monsieur de Bonfons; the president felt he might consider himself the artful old fellow’s son-in-law,—“you-ou said th-th-that b-b-bankruptcy c-c-could, in some c-c-cases, b-b-be p-p-prevented b-b-by—” "
"“由商业法庭。这是常有的事，”克·德蓬丰先生顺着葛朗台的意思，或者说自以为猜到了他的意思，便好心好意地想帮他一把，说道，“请听好。”","“By the courts of commerce themselves.It is done constantly,” said Monsieur C. de Bonfons, bestriding Grandet’s meaning, or thinking he guessed it, and kindly wishing to help him out with it.“Listen.”"
"“好-好的。”葛朗台谦恭地说道，带着一副淘气的神色，就像一个小男孩内心里讥笑着他的老师，却在无比专心地听讲。","“Y-yes,” said Grandet humbly, with the mischievous expression of a boy who is inwardly laughing at his teacher while he pays him the greatest attention."
"“当一个非常受人尊重、非常重要的人物，比方说，您已故的兄弟——”","“When a man so respected and important as, for example, your late brother—” "
"“我-我的兄-兄-兄弟，是的。”","“M-my b-b-brother, yes.”"
"“——有无力清偿债务的危险——”","“—is threatened with insolvency—” "
"“他们把-把-把那个叫做无-无力-力清偿债务？”","“They c-c-call it in-ins-s-solvency?”"
"“是的，在他面临破产时，对他有管辖权的商业法庭（请认真听我说），有权力根据条令任命一位接管人。您知道，债务清偿和破产不一样。当一个人破了产，他就名誉扫地了，可是当他只是清偿债务时，他仍然是个清白的人。”","“Yes; when his failure is imminent, the court of commerce, to which he is amenable (please follow me attentively), has the power, by a decree, to appoint a receiver.Liquidation, you understand, is not the same as failure.When a man fails, he is dishonored; but when he merely liquidates, he remains an honest man.”"
"“那-那-那是太不-不-不一样了，要是不-不-不用花-花-花更-更多的钱的话。”葛朗台说。","“T-t-that’s very d-d-different, if it d-d-doesn’t c-c-cost m-m-more,” said Grandet."
"“但即使不通过法庭，也可以进行清偿的。因为，”庭长说着，吸了口鼻烟，“您不知道破产怎么宣告吗？”","“But a liquidation can be managed without having recourse to the courts at all.For,” said the president, sniffing a pinch of snuff, “don’t you know how failures are declared?”"
"“不-不-不，我从-从-从没想-想-想过。”葛朗台回答。","“N-n-no, I n-n-never t-t-thought,” answered Grandet."
"“首先，”法官接着说，“当事人或者他合法登记的代理人在法庭档案室提交一份资产负债表。第二，由债权人出面申报破产。这时如果当事人不提交资产负债表，或者债权人不向法庭要求裁决当事人无力清偿债务，那会怎么样呢？”","“In the first place,” resumed the magistrate, “by filing the schedule in the record office of the court, which the merchant may do himself, or his representative for him with a power of attorney duly certified.In the second place, the failure may be declared under compulsion from the creditors.Now if the merchant does not file his schedule, and if no creditor appears before the courts to obtain a decree of insolvency against the merchant, what happens?”"
"“会-会-会怎-怎-怎么样呢？”","“W-w-what h-h-happens?”"
"“呃，死者的家人，他的代理人，他的继承人，或者当事人自己——如果他没死，如果他只是躲起来了——或者他的朋友可以清偿他的债务。也许您想清偿令弟的债务吧？”","“Why, the family of the deceased, his representatives, his heirs, or the merchant himself, if he is not dead, or his friends if he is only hiding, liquidate his business.Perhaps you would like to liquidate your brother’s affairs?”"
"“啊！葛朗台，”公证人说，“那可是件应该做的事。外省这地方很看重名声。如果您能保住您的名声——因为毕竟你们是同姓——您可真是个男子汉了——”","“Ah! Grandet,” said the notary, “that would be the right thing to do.There is honor down here in the provinces.If you save your name—for it is your name—you will be a man—” "
"“一个高尚的男子汉！”庭长打断了他叔父的话，大声说道。","“A noble man!” cried the president, interrupting his uncle."
"“当然，”老头回答道，“我的兄-兄-兄弟的名字是葛朗台，和我-我-我的一样。那-那是肯-肯-肯定的，我不-不-不否认这一点。而且这-这-这个债-债-债务清偿可能在许-许-许多方面，对-对-对我-我-我心-心-心爱的侄儿很有-有-有利。不过我得考虑考虑。我不懂-懂-懂巴-巴-巴黎人的把-把-把戏。我生活在-在-在索-索-索米尔，您-您-您没看见吗？我-我-我的葡萄藤，我的水-水-水渠——总之，我有我自己的事-事-事情。我从没开-开-开过期-期-期票。什么是期-期-期票？我收-收-收过很-很-很多，可是我从没签-签-签过一张。我不-不-不懂这些东西。我听-听-听人说，期-期-期票可-可-可以赎-赎-赎回。”","“Certainly,” answered the old man, “my b-b-brother’s name was G-G-Grandet, like m-m-mine.Th-that’s c-c-certain; I d-d-don’t d-d-deny it.And th-th-this l-l-liquidation might be, in m-m-many ways, v-v-very advan-t-t-tageous t-t-to the interests of m-m-my n-n-nephew, whom I l-l-love.But I must consider.I don’t k-k-know the t-t-tricks of P-P-Paris.I b-b-belong to Sau-m-mur, d-d-don’t you see?M-m-my vines, my d-d-drains—in short, I’ve my own b-b-business.I never g-g-give n-n-notes.What are n-n-notes?I t-t-take a good m-m-many, but I have never s-s-signed one.I d-d-don’t understand such things.I have h-h-heard say that n-n-notes c-c-can be b-b-bought up.”"
"“当然，”庭长说，“期票能以百分之几的折扣在市场上买到。您不懂吗？”","“Of course,” said the president.“Notes can be bought in the market, less so much per cent.Don’t you understand?”"
"葛朗台两手做听筒状，于是庭长又把他的话重复了一遍。","Grandet made an ear-trumpet of his hand, and the president repeated his words."
"“好，那么，”老头答道，“其-其-其中是有利-利-利可图了？我这把年纪，弄-弄=弄不清这-这-这些事。我住-住-住在这里，要照-照-照看葡-葡-葡萄藤。葡萄藤长-长-长成了，就是用来开-开-开销的酒。照-照-照看收-收-收成，那-那-那就是我的本分。我主-主-主要的收入是在弗罗瓦丰。我不-不-不能抛下我的家-家-家当，去胡-胡-胡乱思考我一点儿也不-不-不了解的邪恶的事。你说我应该清-清-清偿我兄-兄-兄弟的债-债-债务，以避-避免破-破-破产。我没-没-没法分-分-分身，除非我是一只小-小-小鸟，还有——”","“Well, then,” replied the man, “there’s s-s-something to be g-g-got out of it?I k-know n-nothing at my age about such th-th-things.I l-l-live here and l-l-look after the v-v-vines.The vines g-g-grow, and it’s the w-w-wine that p-p-pays.L-l-look after the v-v-vintage, t-t-that’s my r-r-rule.My c-c-chief interests are at Froidfond.I c-c-can’t l-l-leave my h-h-house to m-m-muddle myself with a d-d-devilish b-b-business I kn-know n-n-nothing about.You say I ought to l-l-liquidate my b-b-brother’s af-f-fairs, to p-p-prevent the f-f-failure.I c-c-can’t be in two p-p-places at once, unless I were a little b-b-bird, and—” "
"“我明白，”公证人嚷道，“嗨，我的老朋友，您有的是朋友，能为您的利益尽心尽力的老朋友。”","“I understand,” cried the notary.“Well, my old friend, you have friends, old friends, capable of devoting themselves to your interests.”"
"“好吧！”葛朗台心想，“赶快点，谈正题吧！”","“All right!” thought Grandet, “make haste and come to the point!”"
"“如果有人去巴黎，找令弟纪尧姆最主要的债权人，跟他说——”","“Suppose one of them went to Paris and saw your brother Guillaume’s chief creditor and said to him—” "
"“慢-慢-慢着，”老头打断了他的话，“说什-什-什么？大概是-是-是这样。索米尔的葛-葛朗台先生这样，索米尔的葛朗台先生那样。他爱-爱他的兄-兄-兄弟，他爱他的侄-侄儿。葛朗台是个好-好-好伯父，他心-心-心地好。他把他的收-收-收成卖了。别-别-别宣告破产，召集开-开-开个会，清-清-清偿债务，然后葛-葛-葛朗台就会知道他能-能-能做什么了。清偿债务比让-让法-法-法院插-插-插手要好。嗯？是不是？”","“One m-m-moment,” interrupted the goodman, “said wh-wh-what?Something l-l-like this.Monsieur Gr-Grandet of Saumur this, Monsieur Grandet of Saumur that.He l-loves his b-b-brother, he loves his n-nephew.Grandet is a g-g-good uncle; he m-m-means well.He has sold his v-v-vintage.D-d-don’t declare a f-f-failure; c-c-call a meeting; l-l-liquidate; and then Gr-Gr-Grandet will see what he c-c-can do.B-b-better liquidate than l-let the l-l-law st-st-stick its n-n-nose in.Hein? Isn’t it so?”"
"“的确如此。”庭长说。","“Exactly so,” said the president."
"“因-因为，德蓬-蓬丰先生，您要知道，凡事都要三-三-三思而后-后-后行。如果不-不-不行，就是不-不-不行。如果不-不-不想倾-倾-倾家荡产的话，就必-必-必须要把所有事-事-事情，所有的资产和债务都弄清。嗯？是不是？”","“B-because, don’t you see, Monsieur de B-Bonfons, a man must l-l-look b-b-before he l-leaps.If you c-c-can’t, you c-c-can’t.M-m-must know all about the m-m-matter, all the resources and the debts, if you d-d-don’t want to be r-r-ruined.Hein? Isn’t it so?”"
"“当然，”庭长说，“我认为几个月内可以用一笔钱赎回债务，然后再通过协议全部偿还。哈！哈！你只要给狗一点儿猪油，就能哄它走好长一段路。只要不宣告破产，把债权握在您的手中，您就能在完事之后，清白得像吹积的雪。”","“Certainly,” said the president.“I’m of opinion that in a few months the debts might be bought up for a certain sum, and then paid in full by an agreement.Ha! Ha! You can coax a dog a long way if you show him a bit of lard.If there has been no declaration of failure, and you hold a lien on the debts, you come out of the business as white as the driven snow.”"
"“雪-雪-雪，”葛朗台说着，把他的手放到耳朵上，“什-什-什么雪？”","“Sn-n-now,” said Grandet, putting his hand to his ear, “wh-wh-what about s-now?”"
"“不过，”庭长大声说道，“请认真听我说。”","“But,” cried the president, “do pray attend to what I am saying.”"
"“我在认真听-听-听着呢。”","“I am at-t-tending.”"
"“期票是一种商品——一件价格有涨有跌的交易品。这是根据杰里米·本瑟姆的高利贷理论得出的推论。这位作者已经证明了对放高利贷者加以谴责的偏见是十分愚蠢的。”","“A note is merchandise,—an article of barter which rises and falls in prices.That is a deduction from Jeremy Bentham’s theory about usury.That writer has proved that the prejudice which condemned usurers to reprobation was mere folly.”"
"“哟！”老头突然喊了起来。","“Whew!” ejaculated the goodman."
"“根据本瑟姆的理论，既然金钱是一件商品，而且任何代表金钱的东西同样是商品，”庭长接着说，“众所周知，有某人某人签名的商业期票会随着商业价值在市场的上下波动，时而价格不菲，时而一钱不值，所以法庭判决——啊！我可真糊涂，对不起——我还是希望您可以按百分之二十五的价钱全部买下令弟的债券。”","“Allowing that money, according to Bentham, is an article of merchandise, and that whatever represents money is equally merchandise,” resumed the president, “allowing also that it is notorious that the commercial note, bearing this or that signature, is liable to the fluctuation of all commercial values, rises or falls in the market, is dear at one moment, and is worth nothing at another, the courts decide—ah! how stupid I am, I beg your pardon—I am inclined to think you could buy up your brother’s debts for twenty-five per cent.”"
"“您-您-您叫-叫-叫他杰-杰-杰里米·本-本？”","“D-d-did you c-c-call him Je-Je-Jeremy B-Ben?”"
"“本瑟姆，一个英国人。”","“Bentham, an Englishman.’ "
"“正是一个叫杰里米的人让我们在生意上不用哭天喊地了。”公证人笑着说道。","“That’s a Jeremy who might save us a lot of lamentations in business,” said the notary, laughing."
"“那些英国人有-有时候说-说-说的话也有道理，”葛朗台说，“这样，照-照-照本-本瑟姆说，如果我兄-兄-兄弟的期-期票一钱不值，如果杰-杰——我说的对-对-对，是吗？我似乎弄明-明-明白了——债-债-债权人会——不，不会，我明白。”","“Those Englishmen s-sometimes t-t-talk sense,” said Grandet.“So, ac-c-cording to Ben-Bentham, if my b-b-brother’s n-notes are worth n-n-nothing; if Je-Je—I’m c-c-correct, am I not?That seems c-c-clear to my m-m-mind—the c-c-creditors would be—no, would not be; I understand.”"
"“让我来解释吧，”庭长说，“从法律上讲，如果您获得葛朗台商号的所有债券，令弟或者他的继承人就不欠任何人的债了。非常好。”","“Let me explain it all,” said the president.“Legally, if you acquire a title to all the debts of the Maison Grandet, your brother or his heirs will owe nothing to any one.Very good.”"
"“非常好-好。”葛朗台跟着说道。","“Very g-good,” repeated Grandet."
"“以公道而论，如果令弟的期票在市场上以百分之几的折扣转让——转让，您明白这个词的意思吗？——如果您的一位朋友碰巧在场就买下了，债权人是自愿出售的，没有受任何强迫，那么已故的葛朗台的遗产就光明正大地免除债务了。”","“In equity, if your brother’s notes are negotiated—negotiated, do you clearly understand the term?—negotiated in the market at a reduction of so much per cent in value, and if one of your friends happening to be present should buy them in, the creditors having sold them of their own free-will without constraint, the estate of the late Grandet is honorably released.”"
"“那倒不-不错，生-生-生意就是生-生-生意，”箍桶匠说道，“可-可-可是，还-还有，您知道，那很-很-很难。我没-没钱-钱-钱，也没-没时-时-时间。”","“That’s t-true; b-b-business is b-business,” said the cooper.“B-b-but, st-still, you know, it is d-d-difficult.I h-have n-no m-m-money and n-no t-t-time.”"
"“是的，但是您不需要亲自做。我马上要去巴黎（您给我出费用，费用没多少的）。我去见债权人，跟他们谈谈，争取期限延长。只要您在资产的总数上再加点钱，把债券全都赎回，就全都搞定了。”","“Yes, but you need not undertake it.I am quite ready to go to Paris (you may pay my expenses, they will only be a trifle).I will see the creditors and talk with them and get an extension of time, and everything can be arranged if you will add something to the assets so as to buy up all title to the debts.”"
"“咱-咱们以后再谈这-这个。我不-不-不能，我不-不-不会随便应承，如果没有——不-不-不行，就是不行，您明白吗？”","“We-we’ll see about th-that.I c-c-can’t and I w-w-won’t bind myself without—He who c-c-can’t, can’t; don’t you see?”"
"“那倒是非常正确。”","“That’s very true.”"
"“您对我讲-讲-讲的话把我搞-搞-搞晕了。这是我有生以来第-第一-一-一次得好好想-想-想想——”","“I’m all p-p-put ab-b-bout by what you’ve t-t-told me.This is the f-first t-t-time in my life I have b-been obliged to th-th-think—” "
"“是的，您又不是律师。”","“Yes, you are not a lawyer.”"
"“我只是个穷-穷-穷种-种葡萄的，一点儿也不-不懂您刚才给我讲-讲的那些话，我必-必-必须琢-琢磨琢磨。”","“I’m only a p-p-poor wine-g-grower, and know n-nothing about wh-what you have just t-told me; I m-m-must th-think about it.”"
"“很好。”庭长说道，准备继续他的论证。","“Very good,” said the president, preparing to resume his argument."
"“侄儿！”公证人用警告的语气打断了他，说道。","“Nephew!” said the notary, interrupting him in a warning tone."
"“啊，怎么了，叔叔？”庭长答道。","“Well, what, uncle?” answered the president."
"“让葛朗台先生解释一下他自己的意图。眼下讨论的这件事可是非同小可。我们的好朋友应该把他的意思说清楚，而且——”","“Let Monsieur Grandet explain his own intentions.The matter in question is of the first importance.Our good friend ought to define his meaning clearly, and—” "
"一声重重的门锤意味着德格拉桑一家的到来，接着他们进了屋并和众人打了招呼，这样克吕绍就没能把话说完。这一打岔，公证人倒觉得高兴，因为葛朗台正开始用怀疑的眼神看着他，那个肉瘤预示着他正在酝酿的一场大阴谋。首先，公证人认为，作为一个民事法庭的庭长，不应该去巴黎蛊惑债权人插手与公正严明的法律相抵触的偷偷摸摸的勾当；其次，由于根本没有听出老葛朗台表示过一点出钱的意思，不管怎样，看到他侄子参与到这件事当中，出于本能，他感到担心。因而趁德格拉桑一家进门时，他拉起侄子的胳膊，把他拉到窗洞下——","A loud knock, which announced the arrival of the des Grassins family, succeeded by their entrance and salutations, hindered Cruchot from concluding his sentence.The notary was glad of the interruption, for Grandet was beginning to look suspiciously at him, and the wen gave signs of a brewing storm.In the first place, the notary did not think it becoming in a president of the Civil courts to go to Paris and manipulate creditors and lend himself to an underhand job which clashed with the laws of strict integrity; moreover, never having known old Grandet to express the slightest desire to pay anything, no matter what, he instinctively feared to see his nephew taking part in the affair.He therefore profited by the entrance of the des Grassins to take the nephew by the arm and lead him into the embrasure of the window,—"
"“你说得已经够多了，侄儿，你已经献够了殷勤。你想得到那个姑娘，这心愿蒙住了你的眼睛。见鬼！你可别没头没脑地乱撞。现在让我来掌舵吧，你可以在旁边帮腔。你认为堂堂一个法官犯得上不顾身份参与这样一桩——”","“You have said enough, nephew; you’ve shown enough devotion.Your desire to win the girl blinds you.The devil! You mustn’t go at it tooth and nail.Let me sail the ship now; you can haul on the braces.Do you think it right to compromise your dignity as a magistrate in such a—” "
"他停下来，因为他听见德格拉桑先生跟老箍桶匠边握手边说——","He stopped, for he heard Monsieur des Grassins saying to the old cooper as they shook hands,—"
"“葛朗台，我们已经得知府上刚刚遭遇的不幸，令人震惊——令弟纪尧姆·葛朗台的商号破产和他的过世。我们特地前来对上述不幸事件表示哀悼。”","“Grandet, we have heard of the frightful misfortunes which have just befallen your family,—the failure of the house of Guillaume Grandet and the death of your brother.We have come to express our grief at these sad events.”"
"“只有一件让人伤心的事，”公证人打断了银行家的话，说道，“小葛朗台先生的过世；如果他能及时想到向他哥哥求助，就决不会自杀的。我们的老朋友爱惜名誉爱到了指甲尖儿，打算清偿巴黎葛朗台商号的债务。为了让他省掉法律程序上麻烦，我的庭长侄子已经提议要去巴黎和债权人谈判，以求圆满解决。”","“There is but one sad event,” said the notary, interrupting the banker,—“the death of Monsieur Grandet, junior; and he would never have killed himself had he thought in time of applying to his brother for help.Our old friend, who is honorable to his finger-nails, intends to liquidate the debts of the Maison Grandet of Paris.To save him the worry of legal proceedings, my nephew, the president, has just offered to go to Paris and negotiate with the creditors for a satisfactory settlement.”"
"葛朗台的态度证实了这番话，他正默默站在那里摸着下巴，这令德格拉桑一行三人惊诧不已，他们一路来的时候，还在悠闲地谈论着那老头的贪婪，差不多要指控是他谋杀了他兄弟。","These words, corroborated by Grandet’s attitude as he stood silently nursing his chin, astonished the three des Grassins, who had been leisurely discussing the old man’s avarice as they came along, very nearly accusing him of fratricide."
"“啊！我早料到了，”银行家一边喊着，一边看着他的妻子，“我刚才跟你说什么了，德格拉桑太太？葛朗台爱惜名誉爱到家了，绝不允许他的名声有丝毫玷污！有钱而没有名誉就是一种病。外省就讲面子！对，很对，葛朗台。我是个老兵，我不会遮掩自己的想法，我就直说了。我的天！真是伟大！”","“Ah! I was sure of it,” cried the banker, looking at his wife.“What did I tell you just now, Madame des Grassins?Grandet is honorable to the backbone, and would never allow his name to remain under the slightest cloud!Money without honor is a disease.There is honor in the provinces!Right, very right, Grandet.I’m an old soldier, and I can’t disguise my thoughts; I speak roughly.Thunder! It is sublime!”"
"“还-还有，伟-伟-伟大的事需要付出很-很-很大的代价。”当银行家热情地紧紧握住老头的手时，老头回答道。","“Th-then s-s-sublime th-things c-c-cost d-dear,” answered the goodman, as the banker warmly wrung his hand."
"“我亲爱的葛朗台，不过这——请庭长原谅——纯粹是商业上的事，需要一个精明的商人。您的代理人必须是个非常熟悉市场的人——熟悉付款、部分退款和利息计算等等。我有私事要去巴黎，我可以负责——”","“But this, my dear Grandet,—if the president will excuse me,—is a purely commercial matter, and needs a consummate businessman.Your agent must be some one fully acquainted with the markets,—with disbursements, rebates, interest calculations, and so forth.I am going to Paris on business of my own, and I can take charge of—” "
"“咱-咱-咱们俩再看看怎-怎-怎么安-安-安排，在这-这-这种特-特-特殊的情况下，而-而-而又不用我应承我做-做-做不到的事，”葛朗台结结巴巴地说道，“您知道，因为庭长先生自然希望我来出这趟旅费。”","“We’ll see about t-t-trying to m-m-manage it b-b-between us, under the p-p-peculiar c-c-circumstances, b-b-but without b-b-binding m-m-myself to anything th-that I c-c-could not do,” said Grandet, stuttering, “because, you see, monsieur le president naturally expects me to pay the expenses of his journey.”"
"老头最后一句话没有打磕巴。","The goodman did not stammer over the last words."
"“啊！”德格拉桑太太喊起来，“去巴黎可是件愉快的事。就是自己掏腰包，我都愿意去呢。”","“Eh!” cried Madame des Grassins, “why it is a pleasure to go to Paris.I would willingly pay to go myself.”"
"她向她的丈夫示意了一下，好像在鼓励他不惜代价把这个差事从敌人手里抢过来；接着她带着讽刺的表情扫了扫那两位克吕绍，那二人看上去满脸沮丧。葛朗台抓住银行家的一个扣子，把他拽到屋子的一个角落。","She made a sign to her husband, as if to encourage him in cutting the enemy out of the commission, @coute que coute@; then she glanced ironically at the two Cruchots, who looked chap-fallen.Grandet seized the banker by a button and drew him into a corner of the room."
"“和庭长比起来，我更信任您，”他说，“而且，我另有更重要的事。”他抽动着他的肉瘤，补充道，“我想等公债八十法郎的时候，买上几千法郎的公债。我听人说，公债每个月底会跌价。您对这些事很在行，是不是？”","“I have a great deal more confidence in you than in the president,” he said, “besides, I’ve other fish to fry,” he added, wriggling his wen.“I want to buy a few thousand francs in the Funds while they are at eighty.They fall, I’m told, at the end of each month.You know all about these things, don’t you?”"
"“我的天哪！那么，我每年都得投资足够多的钱，好让您收入几千法郎啰？”","“Bless me! Then, am I to invest enough to give you a few thousand francs a year?”"
"“开始的时候不用太多。嘘！我不想让任何人知道我要搞这玩意。您可以月底投资买进。什么也不要对克吕绍家的人说，那会惹恼他们的。要是您真的要去巴黎，咱们就看看能为我可怜的侄儿做点什么。”","“That’s not much to begin with.Hush!I don’t want anyone to know I am going to play that game.You can make the investment by the end of the month.Say nothing to the Cruchots; that’ll annoy them.If you are really going to Paris, we will see if there is anything to be done for my poor nephew.”"
"“好的，都说定了。我明天就坐驿车动身，”德格拉桑高声说道，“我会来听听您最后有什么要嘱咐的——您看几点合适呢？”","“Well, it’s all settled.I’ll start tomorrow by the mail-post,” said des Grassins aloud, “and I will come and take your last directions at—what hour will suit you?”"
"“五点，晚饭前。”葛朗台一边说着，一边搓着手。","“Five o’clock, just before dinner,” said Grandet, rubbing his hands."
"两家人又呆了一小会儿。停了片刻之后，德格拉桑拍拍葛朗台的肩膀，说道——","The two parties stayed on for a short time.Des Grassins said, after a pause, striking Grandet on the shoulder,—"
"“有他这样的亲戚可真是件幸事。”","“It is a good thing to have a relation like him.”"
"“是的，是的，虽然表面看不出，”葛朗台说，“我可是个好-好亲戚。我爱我的兄弟，我会证明这一点的，除非得花-花-花——”","“Yes, yes; without making a show,” said Grandet, “I am a g-good relation.I loved my brother, and I will prove it, unless it c-c-costs—” "
"“我们得告辞了，葛朗台，”银行家不等他说完，就适时地打断了他，说道，“要是提早动身的话，我得马上安排一些事。”","“We must leave you, Grandet,” said the banker, interrupting him fortunately before he got to the end of his sentence.“If I hurry my departure, I must attend to some matters at once.”"
"“非常好，非常好！我自己——因-因为我刚才跟-跟您谈的事——我得回我的房间‘仔-仔-仔细考虑’，照克吕绍庭长的说法。”","“Very good, very good!I myself—in c-consequence of what I t-told you—I must retire to my own room and ‘d-d-deliberate,’ as President Cruchot says.”"
"“该死！我不再是德蓬丰先生了。”法官懊丧地想道，他脸上挂着的表情，就像法官被辩护词搞得不胜其烦一样。","“Plague take him!I am no longer Monsieur de Bonfons,” thought the magistrate ruefully, his face assuming the expression of a judge bored by an argument."
"两家人一起离开了。双方不再去想葛朗台早上背叛整个葡萄种植业的罪恶行径了，彼此都想刺探出对方是怎么看待那个狡猾的老头在新近这件事中的真实意图，可是却徒劳无获。","The heads of the two factions walked off together.Neither gave any further thought to the treachery Grandet had been guilty of in the morning against the whole wine-growing community; each tried to fathom what the other was thinking about the real intentions of the wily old man in this new affair, but in vain."
"“您要不要跟我们一起去多尔松瓦太太家？”德格拉桑对公证人说。","“Will you go with us to Madame Dorsonval’s?” said des Grassins to the notary."
"“我们过会儿再去，”庭长回答，“我已经答应去德格里博古小姐那里道个晚安，要是我叔叔愿意的话，我们要先去那里。”","“We will go there later,” answered the president.“I have promised to say good-evening to Mademoiselle de Gribeaucourt, and we will go there first, if my uncle is willing.”"
"“那现在就道别了！”德格拉桑太太说。","“Farewell for the present!” said Madame des Grassins."
"克吕绍二人走开几步后，阿道夫对他父亲说——","When the Cruchots were a few steps off, Adolphe remarked to his father,—"
"“他们没气得冒了烟吧，嗯？”","“Are not they fuming, hein?”"
"“闭上你的嘴，儿子！”他母亲说道，“他们会听见的。而且，你说的话很没品味——法学院的腔调。”","“Hold your tongue, my son!” said his mother, “they might hear you.Besides, what you say is not in good taste,—law-school language.”"
"“好的，叔叔,”当看到德格拉桑一家的身影消失后，庭长喊道，“我开始是德蓬丰，最后就只是克吕绍了。”","“Well, uncle,” cried the president when he saw the des Grassins disappearing, “I began by being de Bonfons, and I have ended as nothing but Cruchot.”"
"“我看出来那让你不高兴，但是风向对德格拉桑家有利。你可真是聪明一世，糊涂一时！让他们上葛朗台‘咱们以后再谈’的贼船吧，镇定些，年轻人。欧仁妮终究会是你的妻子。”","“I saw that that annoyed you; but the wind has set fair for the des Grassins.What a fool you are, with all your cleverness!Let them sail off on Grandet’s ‘We’ll see about it,’ and keep yourself quiet, young man.Eugenie will none the less be your wife.”"
"过了一会儿，葛朗台做出高尚决定的消息同时在三家传开了，整个城里都开始谈论他手足情深的义举。大家原谅了葛朗台破坏业界誓约而私自出售的事；他们赞赏他的荣誉感，开始称赞他的慷慨，他们从没有想到他能这样去做。法国人的部分本性就是对昙花一现的事时而热衷，时而愤怒，时而热诚。是不是群众、民族和国民都缺乏记性呢？","In a few moments the news of Grandet’s magnanimous resolve was disseminated in three houses at the same moment, and the whole town began to talk of his fraternal devotion.Every one forgave Grandet for the sale made in defiance of the good faith pledged to the community; they admired his sense of honor, and began to laud a generosity of which they had never thought him capable.It is part of the French nature to grow enthusiastic, or angry, or fervent about some meteor of the moment.Can it be that collective beings, nationalities, peoples, are devoid of memory?"
"葛朗台老头一关上门，就喊娜农。","When Pere Grandet had shut the door he called Nanon."
"“别放狗，也别上床睡觉，我们有事要一起干。科努瓦耶从弗罗瓦丰赶马车来，十一点将会到门口。听着他的动静，别让他敲门，告诉他进的时候轻点。警察局规定禁止夜间喧哗。再说，左邻右舍没必要知道我准备出门这件事。”","“Don’t let the dog loose, and don’t go to bed; we have work to do together.At eleven o’clock Cornoiller will be at the door with the chariot from Froidfond.Listen for him and prevent his knocking; tell him to come in softly.Police regulations don’t allow nocturnal racket.Besides, the whole neighborhood need not know that I am starting on a journey.”"
"说完，葛朗台回到了他的密室。尽管他非常小心，娜农还是听见他在里面又是走动，又是翻找东西，走来走去。他显然是不想吵醒他的妻子和女儿，尤其是不想引起他侄子的注意。当他看见侄子房门下透出的灯光时，他早已开始诅咒侄子了。差不多半夜时，欧仁妮一心惦记着她的堂弟，觉得好像听见了一声哭叫，像是快要死的人发出的声音。她想，那一定是夏尔；她看他最后一眼时，他脸色那么苍白，绝望透顶——他可能已经自杀了？她很快披了一件宽松的衣服——一种有风帽的披风——正要出房间时，一道强光从门缝射了进来，她以为是着了火。可是当听到娜农沉重的脚步声与嘶哑的说话声，中间还夹杂着几匹马的嘶叫声时，她放心了。","So saying, Grandet returned to his private room, where Nanon heard him moving about, rummaging, and walking to and fro, though with much precaution, for he evidently did not wish to wake his wife and daughter, and above all not to rouse the attention of his nephew, whom he had begun to anathematize when he saw a thread of light under his door.About the middle of the night Eugenie, intent on her cousin, fancied she heard a cry like that of a dying person.It must be Charles, she thought; he was so pale, so full of despair when she had seen him last,—could he have killed himself?She wrapped herself quickly in a loose garment,—a sort of pelisse with a hood,—and was about to leave the room when a bright light coming through the chinks of her door made her think of fire.But she recovered herself as she heard Nanon’s heavy steps and gruff voice mingling with the snorting of several horses."
"“难道我父亲在弄走我的堂弟？”她一边边自言自语，一边非常小心地开了房门，以免发出声响，只开到正好能看得见走廊里。","“Can my father be carrying off my cousin?” she said to herself, opening her door with great precaution lest it should creak, and yet enough to let her see into the corridor."
"突然，她的目光碰上了她父亲的目光，父亲的目光尽管茫然，也没有注意到什么，还是把她吓坏了。老头和娜农两人一起抬着一根粗棍子，棍子两头搭在他们的肩膀上；一条结实的绳子拴在棍子上，上面吊着一个小木桶或是小钢桶，很像葛朗台老头闲着没事时在面包房里做的那些桶。","Suddenly her eye encountered that of her father; and his glance, vague and unnoticing as it was, terrified her.The goodman and Nanon were yoked together by a stout stick, each end of which rested on their shoulders; a stout rope was passed over it, on which was slung a small barrel or keg like those Pere Grandet still made in his bakehouse as an amusement for his leisure hours."
"“圣母玛利亚，这可真重呀！”娜农说道。","“Holy Virgin, how heavy it is!” said the voice of Nanon."
"“可惜只是些铜钱！”葛朗台答道，“小心，你别把烛台碰翻。”","“What a pity that it is only copper sous!” answered Grandet.“Take care you don’t knock over the candlestick.”"
"这个场景只靠一支蜡烛照明，那蜡烛放在楼梯的两根栏杆之间。","The scene was lighted by a single candle placed between two rails of the staircase."
"“科努瓦耶，”葛朗台对他那个有名无实的田庄看管人说道，“你带手枪了吗？”","“Cornoiller,” said Grandet to his keeper @in partibus@, “have you brought your pistols?”"
"“没有，先生。哦！对您的那些铜钱有什么可担心的？”","“No, monsieur.Mercy! What’s there to fear for your copper sous?”"
"“哦！没什么。”葛朗台老头说。","“Oh! Nothing,” said Pere Grandet."
"“再说，咱们会跑得很快，”那个人又说道，“您的佃户挑的是他们最好的马。”","“Besides, we shall go fast,” added the man, “your farmers have picked out their best horses.”"
"“很好。你没告诉他们我要去哪里吧？”","“Very good.You did not tell them where I was going?”"
"“我不知道去哪里。”","“I didn’t know where.”"
"“很好。车子结实吗？”","“Very good.Is the carriage strong?”"
"“结实？嗨，听这话说的！嘿，它能装三千斤。那个破桶有多重？”","“Strong? Hear to that, now!Why, it can carry three thousand weight.How much does that old keg weigh?”"
"“天哪！”娜农惊呼道，“我可知道！基本差不多有一千八百——”","“Goodness!” exclaimed Nanon.“I ought to know!There’s pretty nigh eighteen hundred—” "
"“能不能闭上你的嘴，娜农！你告诉我太太，说我去乡下了。我会回来吃晚饭的。车赶得快点，科努瓦耶，我九点前必须赶到昂热。”","“Will you hold your tongue, Nanon!You are to tell my wife I have gone into the country.I shall be back to dinner.Drive fast, Cornoiller; I must get to Angers before nine o’clock.”"
"马车走了。娜农闩上大门，放出狗，带着肿痛的肩膀去睡觉了。街坊四邻没有一个人知道葛朗台走的事，也不知道他此行的目的。老守财奴的谨慎和缄默一刻也没有放松过。尽管屋子里堆满了金子，可是谁也没见过一个子儿。早上，这个老葡萄园主从码头人们的闲谈中听说，由于南特在进行某些军需准备，黄金汇率已经翻了一番，投机商们已经赶到昂热去收购金币了，这个老葡萄种植商便急忙从佃户那里借来了马匹，抓住机会要把他的金子卖掉，再换回国库券，经此交易，这笔款子的数额已剧增，他打算用来买进公债。","The carriage drove off.Nanon bolted the great door, let loose the dog, and went off to bed with a bruised shoulder, no one in the neighborhood suspecting either the departure of Grandet or the object of his journey.The precautions of the old miser and his reticence were never relaxed.No one had ever seen a penny in that house, filled as it was with gold.Hearing in the morning, through the gossip of the port, that exchange on gold had doubled in price in consequence of certain military preparations undertaken at Nantes, and that speculators had arrived at Angers to buy coin, the old wine-grower, by the simple process of borrowing horses from his farmers, seized the chance of selling his gold and of bringing back in the form of treasury notes the sum he intended to put into the Funds, having swelled it considerably by the exchange."
"第八章","Chapter VIII "
"“我父亲走了。”欧仁妮心想，她在楼梯顶部听到了所发生的一切。屋子又恢复了寂静；远处马车的隆隆声渐渐消失了，不再在这个沉睡的城市里回荡了。这时，欧仁妮耳朵还没听到，就先在心里听见了一声哭喊，那哭喊声从她堂弟的卧室穿过隔墙传了过来。一道像马刀刀刃一样细的光从门缝射出来，横照在破旧的楼梯的扶手上。","“My father has gone,” thought Eugenie, who heard all that took place from the head of the stairs.Silence was restored in the house, and the distant rumbling of the carriage, ceasing by degrees, no longer echoed through the sleeping town.At this moment Eugenie heard in her heart, before the sound caught her ears, a cry which pierced the partitions and came from her cousin’s chamber.A line of light, thin as the blade of a sabre, shone through a chink in the door and fell horizontally on the balusters of the rotten staircase."
"“他很难受！”她一边往楼上跑，一边说。听到第二声呻吟时，她已跑到了靠近他房间的楼梯口。门虚掩着，她推开了门。夏尔正睡着，他的头垂在旧扶手椅的一侧，一只手几乎触到了地板，笔已从那只手里掉了下来。这种不舒服的姿势造成他呼吸困难，这让欧仁妮突然害怕起来，她赶紧进了屋子。","“He suffers!” she said, springing up the stairs.A second moan brought her to the landing near his room.The door was ajar, she pushed it open.Charles was sleeping; his head hung over the side of the old armchair, and his hand, from which the pen had fallen, nearly touched the floor.The oppressed breathing caused by the strained posture suddenly frightened Eugenie, who entered the room hastily."
"“他一定很累。”她自言自语道，瞥见了桌子上放着的十几封已封好的信。她看看信上的地址：","“He must be very tired,” she said to herself, glancing at a dozen letters lying sealed upon the table.She read their addresses: "
"“法里、布雷依曼车行收”；“比松裁缝店收”等等。","“To Messrs. Farry, Breilmann, & Co., carriage-makers”; “To Monsieur Buisson, tailor,” etc."
"“他一直在处理他的事情，这样就能马上离开法国了。”她想。她的眼睛落在两封打开的信上。信里写道：“我亲爱的安妮特，”一看其中一封的开头，她的两眼瞬间就发黑了。她的心跳加速，脚像被钉在了地板上一样。","“He has been settling all his affairs, so as to leave France at once,” she thought.Her eyes fell upon two open letters.The words, “My dear Annette,” at the head of one of them, blinded her for a moment.Her heart beat fast, her feet were nailed to the floor."
"“他亲爱的安妮特！他在恋爱！有人爱着他！没有希望了！他对她说了什么？”","“His dear Annette!He loves! He is loved!No hope!What does he say to her?”"
"这些念头从她的脑海和心里闪过。她到处都能看见这些像火焰一样的字，甚至地板砖上都有。","These thoughts rushed through her head and heart.She saw the words everywhere, even on the bricks of the floor, in letters of fire."
"“就这样放弃他？不，不！我不看这封信。我应该走开——我要是看了会怎样呢？”","“Resign him already?No, no!I will not read the letter.I ought to go away—What if I do read it?”"
"她看着夏尔，然后温柔地把他的头托起，并将其靠在椅背上；他任由她摆布着，就像一个孩子，尽管睡着，也知道那是他母亲的爱抚，便继续在梦乡里享受着她的亲吻和小心的呵护。欧仁妮就像母亲一样，拿起他垂下的手，像母亲一样温柔地亲吻着他那栗色的头发——“亲爱的安妮特！”一个魔鬼在她耳边尖声叫着这几个字眼。","She looked at Charles, then she gently took his head and placed it against the back of the chair; he let her do so, like a child which, though asleep, knows its mother’s touch and receives, without awaking, her kisses and watchful care.Like a mother Eugenie raised the drooping hand, and like a mother she gently kissed the chestnut hair—“Dear Annette!” a demon shrieked the words in her ear."
"“我这么做不对，可是我必须看那封信。”她说。她扭过头去，因为她高尚的正义感在谴责她。生平第一次，善与恶一起在她心里挣扎。直到那一刻，她还从来没有做过任何让她脸红的事。强烈的爱和好奇心胜利了。她一句一句读着，情绪越来越激动，看信时溢满全身的炙热只能让这初恋的快乐变得更加珍贵。","“I am doing wrong; but I must read it, that letter,” she said.She turned away her head, for her noble sense of honor reproached her.For the first time in her life good and evil struggled together in her heart.Up to that moment she had never had to blush for any action.Passion and curiosity triumphed.As she read each sentence her heart swelled more and more, and the keen glow which filled her being as she did so, only made the joys of first love still more precious."
"我亲爱的安妮特——除了我现在遭遇的这巨大不幸——这是任何人都无法预料到的——什么也不能把我们分开。我父亲自杀了，他的财产和我的财产都荡然无存，不可挽回了。我这个年龄就成了孤儿，以我所受的教育性质而言，我这个年纪还算是个孩子，但是我必须像个男子汉一样，从我身陷的深渊中爬起来。我刚花了半个晚上的时间琢磨我的处境。","My dear Annette,—Nothing could ever have separated us but the great misfortune which has now overwhelmed me, and which no human foresight could have prevented.My father has killed himself; his fortune and mine are irretrievably lost.I am orphaned at an age when, through the nature of my education, I am still a child; and yet I must lift myself as a man out of the abyss into which I am plunged.I have just spent half the night in facing my position."
"如果我希望以一个正人君子的身份离开法国——这一点是毫无疑问的——去西印度群岛或美洲碰碰运气，我连一百法郎都没有。是的，我可怜的安娜，我必须要在那种恶劣的气候条件下寻找发财的机会。他们告诉我，在那些地方，我肯定能成功。至于说继续留在巴黎，我是做不到的。无论我的本性，还是我的脸面，都受不了别人对一个倾家荡产的人——一个破产者的儿子所表示出的那种轻蔑、冷漠和鄙薄！老天啊！想想吧，竟然欠了两百万！我第一个星期就会在决斗中被人杀死，因此我是不会回去的。你的爱——最温柔、最忠贞的爱，曾经使一个男人的心灵得到升华——也是无法把我拉回去的。唉！我的心上人，","If I wish to leave France an honest man,—and there is no doubt of that,—I have not a hundred francs of my own with which to try my fate in the Indies or in America.Yes, my poor Anna, I must seek my fortune in those deadly climates.Under those skies, they tell me, I am sure to make it.As for remaining in Paris, I cannot do so.Neither my nature nor my face are made to bear the affronts, the neglect, the disdain shown to a ruined man, the son of a bankrupt!Good God! Think of owing two millions!I should be killed in a duel the first week; therefore I shall not return there.Your love—the most tender and devoted love which ever ennobled the heart of man—cannot draw me back.Alas! My beloved,"
"我没钱去找你，好给你最后一吻，或接受你的最后一吻，从亲吻中，我可能会为我那几乎没有成功希望的事业汲取一些力量。","I have no money with which to go to you, to give and receive a last kiss from which I might derive some strength for my forlorn enterprise."
"“可怜的夏尔！幸亏我读了这封信。我有金子，我会给他的。”欧仁妮心想。","“Poor Charles!I did well to read the letter.I have gold; I will give it to him,” thought Eugenie."
"她擦擦眼睛，继续往下看。","She wiped her eyes, and went on reading."
"我从没想过贫困的悲惨。我即使有了一百金路易用作必不可少的旅行费，也没有一个子儿用来做本钱。可是，没有，我没有那一百个金路易，甚至连一个都没有。我不知道等我把巴黎的债全都还清后，还能剩下什么。如果我身无分文，我会一声不响地去南特，上船当个普通的水手；我会像其他那些年轻时白手起家的人一样，开始在新世界闯荡，从西印度群岛赚回大笔的财富。在这漫长的一天中，我冷静地考虑了我的前途。我的前途似乎比别人的都更可怕，因为我曾被疼爱我的母亲宠爱过，受过最慈祥的父亲的溺爱，刚一踏入社会，又幸运地得到了一位叫安娜的女士的爱情！我所知道的就只是生活中的鲜花。这样的幸福不可能长久。","I have never thought of the miseries of poverty.If I have the hundred louis required for the mere costs of the journey, I have not a sou for an outfit.But no, I have not the hundred louis, not even one louis.I don’t know that anything will be left after I have paid my debts in Paris.If I have nothing, I shall go quietly to Nantes and ship as a common sailor; and I will begin in the new world like other men who have started young without a sou and brought back the wealth of the Indies.During this long day I have faced my future coolly.It seems more horrible for me than for another, because I have been so petted by a mother who adored me, so indulged by the kindest of fathers, so blessed by meeting, on my entrance into life, with the love of an Anna!The flowers of life are all I have ever known.Such happiness could not last."
"可是，我亲爱的安妮特，我感觉有了更多的勇气，超过了一个无忧无虑的年轻人应该有的——尤其是一个习惯了巴黎最迷人的女人的爱抚、享尽家庭幸福的年轻人，他在家里事事顺心，父亲对他则是有求必应——哦，我的父亲呀！安妮特，他死了！","Nevertheless, my dear Annette, I feel more courage than a careless young man is supposed to feel,—above all a young man used to the caressing ways of the dearest woman in all Paris, cradled in family joys, on whom all things smiled in his home, whose wishes were a law to his father—oh, my father!Annette, he is dead!"
"唉，我反复考虑了我的处境，还有你的处境。一天之内，我就变老了。亲爱的安娜，如果让我和你一起留在巴黎，你就要放弃你的奢华、你的衣着、你的歌剧院包厢，我们甚至都没有足够的钱来维持我挥霍的生活。再说，我决不会让你放弃这些的。不，咱们现在就得永别了——　","Well, I have thought over my position, and yours as well.I have grown old in twenty-four hours.Dear Anna, if in order to keep me with you in Paris you were to sacrifice your luxury, your dress, your opera-box, we should even then not have enough for the expenses of my extravagant ways of living.Besides, I would never accept such sacrifices.No, we must part now and forever—"
"“他放弃了她！圣母玛利亚！太幸福了！”","“He gives her up!Blessed Virgin!What happiness!”"
"欧仁妮高兴得直发抖。夏尔动了一下，吓得她浑身一阵寒战。所幸，他没有醒来，于是她接着看下去。","Eugenie quivered with joy.Charles made a movement, and a chill of terror ran through her.Fortunately, he did not wake, and she resumed her reading."
"我什么时候会回来？我不知道。据他们说，西印度群岛的气候会让一个欧洲人变老，尤其是一个辛苦劳作的欧洲人。让我们想想十年后可能会发生什么吧。十年后，你的女儿就十八岁了，她将成为你的伙伴，你的密探。对你来说，社会将是残酷的，而你的女儿也许更为残酷。严厉的社会评判和女儿们忘恩负义的例子屡见不鲜，我们要引以为戒。请像我一样，把这四年幸福的回忆珍藏在你的心灵深处吧，再有，如果可能的话，一定要将你这可怜的朋友铭记在心，并对他忠诚不渝。你知道吗，亲爱的安妮特，我不能强求这份忠诚，因为我必须适应我新生活中的种种突变；我必须用平常的眼光来看待它们，并尽力而为。所以我必须考虑结婚，这成了我未来生活中一件必须做的事；我要向你承认，就在索米尔这里，在我伯父的家中，我遇到了一位堂姐，她的容貌、举止、头脑和心地都会让你喜欢的，而且在我看来，她似乎——　","When shall I return?I do not know.The climate of the West Indies ages a European, so they say, especially a European who works hard.Let us think what may happen ten years hence.In ten years your daughter will be eighteen; she will be your companion, your spy.To you society will be cruel, and your daughter perhaps more cruel still.We have seen cases of the harsh social judgment and ingratitude of daughters; let us take warning by them.Keep in the depths of your soul, as I shall in mine, the memory of four years of happiness, and be faithful, if you can, to the memory of your poor friend.I cannot exact such faithfulness, because, do you see, dear Annette, I must conform to the exigencies of my new life; I must take a commonplace view of them and do the best I can.Therefore I must think of marriage, which becomes one of the necessities of my future existence; and I will admit to you that I have found, here in Saumur, in my uncle’s house, a cousin whose face, manners, mind, and heart would please you, and who, besides, seems to me—"
"“他一定是太累了，才停下笔来。”当欧仁妮看到信的最后一句话戛然停到半中间时，心里这样想。","“He must have been very weary to have ceased writing to her,” thought Eugenie, as she gazed at the letter which stopped abruptly in the middle of the last sentence."
"她已经在为他辩护了。一个天真无邪的姑娘怎么可能察觉出信中所流露的冷漠无情呢？对于在宗教气氛中长大的少女来说，她们的思想无知而纯洁，一旦涉足那迷人的爱情世界，便把一切都看作爱情了。她们漫步其中，沐浴在天国的光辉里，这圣光从她们的灵魂中散发出来，又映照到她们所爱的人身上；她们用自己感情的火焰点燃一切，并把自己崇高的思想归于爱人的功劳。一个女人的错误几乎总是来自于她对善的信仰或是她对真理的信任。“我亲爱的安妮特，我的心上人”这几个字就像是爱情最甜美的语言，在欧仁妮单纯的内心里回响着；它们轻抚着她的心灵，仿佛儿时听的“来吧，让我们一起赞美”，那美妙的音符被风琴反复弹奏着，悦耳动听。而且，仍旧挂在那个年轻人睫毛上的泪水显示出了那种心灵的高贵，少女们自然而然会为之动情。夏尔尽管爱着他的父亲并真诚地在悼念他，这与其说是出于他的心地善良，倒不如说是为父爱所感动，她又怎么会知道这个呢？纪尧姆·葛朗台先生和夫人总是满足儿子的所有愿望，给他大笔的钱财去随意挥霍，使得夏尔不会去做些可怕的算计，这是巴黎很多的少爷们或多或少都会有的罪孽。那些少爷们在面对花花世界时，他们便产生了欲念，心怀鬼胎。他们痛苦地看到，在父母的有生之年，这些欲念和阴谋都必须推后或暂时放到一边。","Already she defended him.How was it possible that an innocent girl should perceive the cold-heartedness evinced by this letter?To young girls religiously brought up, whose minds are ignorant and pure, all is love from the moment they set their feet within the enchanted regions of that passion.They walk there bathed in a celestial light shed from their own souls, which reflects its rays upon their lover; they color all with the flame of their own emotion and attribute to him their highest thoughts.A woman’s errors come almost always from her belief in good or her confidence in truth.In Eugenie’s simple heart the words, “My dear Annette, my loved one,” echoed like the sweetest language of love; they caressed her soul as, in childhood, the divine notes of the @Venite adoremus@, repeated by the organ, caressed her ear.Moreover, the tears which still lingered on the young man’s lashes gave signs of that nobility of heart by which young girls are rightly won.How could she know that Charles, though he loved his father and mourned him truly, was moved far more by paternal goodness than by the goodness of his own heart?Monsieur and Madame Guillaume Grandet, by gratifying every fancy of their son, and lavishing upon him the pleasures of a large fortune, had kept him from making the horrible calculations of which so many sons in Paris become more or less guilty when, face to face with the enjoyments of the world, they form desires and conceive schemes which they see with bitterness must be put off or laid aside during the lifetime of their parents."
"在这种情况下，父亲的慷慨在儿子的心中撒下了真爱，这真爱中没有任何自私自利、有所保留的念头。","The liberality of the father in this instance had shed into the heart of the son a real love, in which there was no afterthought of self-interest."
"可是，夏尔是个真正的巴黎孩子，在社会风气和安妮特亲身的调教下，他凡事都要盘算一番，虽然脸上还洋溢着年轻气，但他已经是个世故的人了。他曾经历过社会生活的可怕教育，在那个社会生活圈子里，一个晚上，在思想和言语上所犯的罪比法官在巡回审判庭所判罚的罪行还要多；打趣和俏皮话在诋毁最高尚的思想；只有目光准确的人才可谓强者：在那个圈子里，目光准确就是一概不信，既不相信感情，也不相信人，甚至也不相信事实——因为事实是捏造的。","Nevertheless, Charles was a true child of Paris, taught by the customs of society and by Annette herself to calculate everything; already an old man under the mask of youth.He had gone through the frightful education of social life, of that world where in one evening more crimes are committed in thought and speech than justice ever punishes at the assizes; where jests and clever sayings assassinate the noblest ideas; where no one is counted strong unless his mind sees clear: and to see clear in that world is to believe in nothing, neither in feelings, nor in men, nor even in events,—for events are falsified."
"在那个圈子里，要想“目光准确”，我们就必须每天都掂掂朋友钱包的分量，学会如何巧妙地使自己保持上风；还要谨慎小心，不赞赏任何东西，不管是艺术作品，还是值得称颂的行为；并牢记自身的利益是尘世间一切事物的主要动力。在数番风流放纵之后，那个贵妇——美丽的安妮特——迫使夏尔进行了认真的思考；她把散发着香气的手放进他的卷发，跟他谈论着他将来的地位；当她重新梳理他的一绺绺头发时，她教给他精明处世的经验；她使他变得女性化、物质化——这是一种双重的腐蚀，却又是一种细腻而优雅的腐蚀，十分高雅得体。","There, to “see clear” we must weigh a friend’s purse daily, learn how to keep ourselves adroitly on the top of the wave, cautiously admire nothing, neither works of art nor glorious actions, and remember that self-interest is the mainspring of all things here below.After committing many follies, the great lady—the beautiful Annette—compelled Charles to think seriously; with her perfumed hand among his curls, she talked to him of his future position; as she rearranged his locks, she taught him lessons of worldly prudence; she made him effeminate and materialized him,—a double corruption, but a delicate and elegant corruption, in the best taste."
"“你很傻，夏尔，”她会对他说，“我得费好大劲来教你懂得世道。你对德吕伯克斯先生的态度很糟糕。我很清楚他不是个正人君子，可是你得等到他失势的时候，才可以随心所欲地鄙薄他。你知道康庞夫人是怎么对我们说的？——‘亲爱的，只要一个人还在台上，就敬爱他；等他下了台，就帮着把他拖到阴沟里。有权时，他是个神；倒台时，他比阴沟里的马拉还要低等，因为他还活着，而马拉死了。人生就是一系列的暗码，要想使自己一直处于有利的位置，你就必须研究它们，理解它们。’”","“You are very foolish, Charles,” she would say to him.“I shall have a great deal of trouble in teaching you to understand the world.You behaved extremely ill to Monsieur des Lupeaulx.I know very well he is not an honorable man; but wait till he is no longer in power, then you may despise him as much as you like.Do you know what Madame Campan used to tell us?—‘My dears, as long as a man is a minister, adore him; when he falls, help to drag him in the gutter.Powerful, he is a sort of god; fallen, he is lower than Marat in the sewer, because he is living, and Marat is dead.Life is a series of combinations, and you must study them and understand them if you want to keep yourselves always in good position.’” "
"夏尔老于世故，他的父母让他过得太幸福了，在社交中，他又曾受到太多的阿谀奉承，他是不会拥有高尚的情感的。母亲在他心中播下的金粒子已经在巴黎社会的锻造中被敲打得薄之又薄。他把金子撒在表面，而金子在生活的摩擦下被慢慢磨蚀掉了。夏尔只有二十一岁。在这个年纪，青春的朝气似乎和心灵的直率和真诚是分不开的。那声音、那目光、那面容本身似乎都是和感情协调一致的。所以即使是最严厉的法官、最不轻信的律师、最不通融的高利贷者都总是不会贸然相信：一个人的眼睛仍旧明亮清澈，额头也没有一道皱纹，内心却老于世故或是心术不正。迄今为止，夏尔还没有机会去应用巴黎式的道德准则。直至此时，他的美还美在缺乏经验。然而，他不知不觉就已经被灌输了自私的思想。巴黎人政治经济的胚芽在他心里潜伏着，一旦悠然自得的旁观者变成了现实生活戏剧中的演员，迟早那胚芽一定会开花的。","Charles was too much a man of the world, his parents had made him too happy, he had received too much adulation in society, to be possessed of noble sentiments.The grain of gold dropped by his mother into his heart was beaten thin in the smithy of Parisian society; he had spread it superficially, and it was worn away by the friction of life.Charles was only twenty-one years old.At that age the freshness of youth seems inseparable from candor and sincerity of soul.The voice, the glance, the face itself, seem in harmony with the feelings; and thus it happens that the sternest judge, the most sceptical lawyer, the least complying of usurers, always hesitate to admit decrepitude of heart or the corruption of worldly calculation while the eyes are still bathed in purity and no wrinkles seam the brow.Charles, so far, had had no occasion to apply the maxims of Parisian morality; up to this time he was still endowed with the beauty of inexperience.And yet, unknown to himself, he had been inoculated with selfishness.The germs of Parisian political economy, latent in his heart, would assuredly burst forth, sooner or later, whenever the careless spectator became an actor in the drama of real life."
"几乎所有的少女都会被这种外表所预示的温柔所迷惑：即使欧仁妮也像外省姑娘一样谨慎，并且善于察言观色，但是在堂弟的举止、言辞及行为还和年轻人内心的憧憬相一致的时候，她是不可能怀疑他的。只是一个偶然的机会——一个致命的机会——让她看到了激荡在那个年轻人心中的最后一次真情流露；她似乎听到了他良心最后的呼吸声。她把那封在她看来情意绵绵的信放下，开始微笑着端详起她熟睡的堂弟；至少在她眼里，对人生充满朝气的幻想依旧还停留在他的脸上；她暗暗发誓要永远爱他。接着，她把目光投向另外一封信，不再觉得这第二次鲁莽之举有多么严重了；尽管她在看着信，但她唯一的目的却是为了找到品格高尚的新证据，像所有女人一样，她认为这是她心仪的男人所具有的品质。","Nearly all young girls succumb to the tender promises such an outward appearance seems to offer: even if Eugenie had been as prudent and observing as provincial girls are often found to be, she was not likely to distrust her cousin when his manners, words, and actions were still in unison with the aspirations of a youthful heart.A mere chance—a fatal chance—threw in her way the last effusions of real feeling which stirred the young man’s soul; she heard as it were the last breathings of his conscience.She laid down the letter—to her so full of love—and began smilingly to watch her sleeping cousin; the fresh illusions of life were still, for her at least, upon his face; she vowed to herself to love him always.Then she cast her eyes on the other letter, without attaching much importance to this second indiscretion; and though she read it, it was only to obtain new proofs of the noble qualities which, like all women, she attributed to the man her heart had chosen."
"我亲爱的阿方斯——当你收到这封信时，我已经没有朋友了；可是我向你保证，尽管我怀疑这世上的友谊，却从没有怀疑过你的友情。因此，我求你来料理我的所有事情，并且指望你竭尽所能把我的财物卖个好价。现在，你已经知道了我的处境。我一无所有，打算马上去印度。我已经写信给所有我认为是债主的人，你会看到随信附上的名单，凭记忆我尽量做到准确无误。我想，我的书籍、我的家具、我的画、我的马匹等等，应该可以抵清我的债务。也许，除了一些可以用作我创业本钱的小玩意儿，我不想保留任何东西。我亲爱的阿方斯，我将给你邮寄一份正式授权书，你可以凭此出售这些东西。请将我所有的武器都寄给我。你留着布里顿吧，没有人会为那匹骏马出高价的，所以我宁可把它给了你——好像一个临死之人把纪念死者的戒指赠予遗嘱执行人一样。法里、布雷依曼车行给我造了一量非常舒适的旅行马车，他们还没有送货；请说服他们将车留下，别要我作任何赔付。如果他们拒绝了，尽你所能去处理吧，以我目前的处境，有损名誉之事应尽量避免。我欠那个英国岛民六个金路易，我打牌输的，别忘了还他——","My dear Alphonse,—When you receive this letter I shall be without friends; but let me assure you that while I doubt the friendship of the world, I have never doubted yours.I beg you therefore to settle all my affairs, and I trust to you to get as much as you can out of my possessions.By this time you know my situation.I have nothing left, and I intend to go at once to the Indies.I have just written to all the people to whom I think I owe money, and you will find enclosed a list of their names, as correct as I can make it from memory.My books, my furniture, my pictures, my horses, etc., ought, I think, to pay my debts.I do not wish to keep anything, except, perhaps, a few baubles which might serve as the beginning of an outfit for my enterprise.My dear Alphonse, I will send you a proper power of attorney under which you can make these sales.Send me all my weapons.Keep Briton for yourself; nobody would pay the value of that noble beast, and I would rather give him to you—like a mourning-ring bequeathed by a dying man to his executor.Farry, Breilmann, & Co. built me a very comfortable travelling-carriage, which they have not yet delivered; persuade them to keep it and not ask for any payment on it.If they refuse, do what you can in the matter, and avoid everything that might seem dishonorable in me under my present circumstances.I owe the British Islander six louis, which I lost at cards; don’t fail to pay him—"
"“亲爱的堂弟！”欧仁妮一边悄声说着，一边扔下信，轻手轻脚地跑回自己的房间，拿起了一支点燃的蜡烛。当她打开一个旧橡木柜的抽屉时，一阵愉悦的兴奋感传遍了她的全身。那柜子是文艺复兴时期的精品，尽管有部分磨损，上面仍旧可以看见著名的蝾螈王室的徽号。她从抽屉里拿出一个带金坠子的红丝绒大钱袋，边上是失去光泽的金线流苏——那是她祖母留下一个遗物。她骄傲地把它放在手里掂掂分量，兴冲冲地开始数起她那很少的私房钱来，她已经忘了数目是多少了。她先拿出二十枚葡萄牙金币，仍旧很新，一七二五年约翰五世在位时铸造，按她父亲告诉她的，兑换率是每枚五葡币，或是每枚一百六十八法郎六十四生丁；不过，因为这些硬币稀少而且漂亮，闪着小太阳似的光泽，它们的常规市价是一枚一百八十法郎。其次，五枚各值一百法郎的热那亚金币，是另一种非常稀罕的硬币，市值八十七法郎，而收藏家出价是一百法郎。这些东西过去都是属于老德拉贝尔特利耶先生的。其次，三枚一七二九年菲利普五世时铸造的西班牙金币，是让蒂耶夫人一枚一枚交给她的，当让蒂耶夫人赠送礼物的时候，总是用相同的字眼说道：“这个可爱的小金丝雀，这个黄澄澄的小东西，值九十八法郎呢！收着它，我的好乖乖，它将来就是你金库里的一宝。”其次（这些硬币中的纯金，二十三克拉挂零，是她父亲最珍视的），一百枚荷兰达克特，一七五六年铸造，每枚值十三法郎。其次，一批罕见的古玩，是守财奴们最珍爱的一种纪念章——三枚卢比刻有天平图案，五枚卢比刻着圣母像，全是二十四克拉的纯金，是莫卧儿大帝时的精美钱币，每一枚仅按重量算就值三十七法郎四十生丁，但对喜欢玩赏金币的行家来说，至少值五十法郎。","“Dear cousin!” whispered Eugenie, throwing down the letter and running softly back to her room, carrying one of the lighted candles.A thrill of pleasure passed over her as she opened the drawer of an old oak cabinet, a fine specimen of the period called the Renaissance, on which could still be seen, partly effaced, the famous royal salamander.She took from the drawer a large purse of red velvet with gold tassels, edged with a tarnished fringe of gold wire,—a relic inherited from her grandmother.She weighed it proudly in her hand, and began with delight to count over the forgotten items of her little hoard.First she took out twenty @portugaises@, still new, struck in the reign of John V., 1725, worth by exchange, as her father told her, five @lisbonnines@, or a hundred and sixty-eight francs, sixty-four centimes each; their conventional value, however, was a hundred and eighty francs apiece, on account of the rarity and beauty of the coins, which shone like little suns.Item, five @genovines@, or five hundred-franc pieces of Genoa; another very rare coin worth eighty-seven francs on exchange, but a hundred francs to collectors.These had formerly belonged to old Monsieur de la Bertelliere.Item, three gold @quadruples@, Spanish, of Philip V., struck in 1729, given to her one by one by Madame Gentillet, who never failed to say, using the same words, when she made the gift, “This dear little canary, this little yellow-boy, is worth ninety-eight francs!Keep it, my pretty one, it will be the flower of your treasure.”Item (that which her father valued most of all, the gold of these coins being twenty-three carats and a fraction), a hundred Dutch ducats, made in the year 1756, and worth thirteen francs apiece.Item, a great curiosity, a species of medal precious to the soul of misers,—three rupees with the sign of the Scales, and five rupees with the sign of the Virgin, all in pure gold of twenty-four carats; the magnificent money of the Great Mogul, each of which was worth by mere weight thirty-seven francs, forty centimes, but at least fifty francs to those connoisseurs who love to handle gold."
"其次，前一天拿到的四十法郎拿破仑金币，她忘记收拾到丝绒钱袋里了。这些珍宝都是全新的硬币，是真正的艺术品，葛朗台不时会问到，让拿出来看看，并给女儿指出它们内在的优点——比如，抛光边缘的做工多么精美，平滑的表面多么光亮，字体多么饱满，字体笔划的棱角也没有磨掉。","Item, the napoleon of forty francs received the day before, which she had forgotten to put away in the velvet purse.This treasure was all in virgin coins, true works of art, which Grandet from time to time inquired after and asked to see, pointing out to his daughter their intrinsic merits,—such as the beauty of the milled edge, the clearness of the flat surface, the richness of the lettering, whose angles were not yet rubbed off."
"欧仁妮根本不考虑这些奇珍异品，也没有顾及她父亲对这些东西的迷恋，更没有去想抢走父亲心爱的宝贝会招来什么样的危险；没有，她只想着她的堂弟。在算错几次之后，她很快弄清楚她大约拥有五千八百法郎的实际财产，如果卖给收藏家，还有一定的附加值，价值差不多就是六千法郎。","Eugenie gave no thought to these rarities, nor to her father’s mania for them, nor to the danger she incurred in depriving herself of a treasure so dear to him; no, she thought only of her cousin, and soon made out, after a few mistakes of calculation, that she possessed about five thousand eight hundred francs in actual value, which might be sold for their additional value to collectors for nearly six thousand."
"她看着自己的财产，拍起了手，好像一个高兴的孩子必须手舞足蹈才能释放那抑制不住的喜悦。父亲和女儿这晚各自清点了自己的财产——他，要卖他的金子；欧仁妮，要把她的金币投入到爱情的海洋中。她把金币放回了旧钱袋，拿到手中，毫不犹豫地跑上了楼。她堂弟暗中的窘境让她忘记了时间和体统；她的良心、她的献身精神和她的快乐给她壮了胆。","She looked at her wealth and clapped her hands like a happy child forced to spend its overflowing joy in artless movements of the body.Father and daughter had each counted up their fortune this night,—he, to sell his gold; Eugenie, to fling hers into the ocean of affection.She put the pieces back into the old purse, took it in her hand, and ran upstairs without hesitation.The secret misery of her cousin made her forget the hour and conventional propriety; she was strong in her conscience, in her devotion, in her happiness."
"当她一只手拿着蜡烛，另一只手拿着钱袋，站在门槛上时，夏尔醒了，看见了她，惊讶得说不出话来。欧仁妮走上前，把蜡烛放在桌子上，声音颤抖着说道：","As she stood upon the threshold of the door, holding the candle in one hand and the purse in the other, Charles woke, caught sight of her, and remained speechless with surprise.Eugenie came forward, put the candle on the table, and said in a quivering voice: "
"“堂弟，我必须请你原谅，我做了一件对不起你的事；不过，上帝会宽恕我的——如果你——帮我把它一笔勾销的话。”","“My cousin, I must beg pardon for a wrong I have done you; but God will pardon me—if you—will help me to wipe it out.”"
"“是什么事？”夏尔揉了揉眼睛，问道。","“What is it?” asked Charles, rubbing his eyes."
"“我看了那些信。”","“I have read those letters.”"
"夏尔脸红了。","Charles colored."
"“怎么回事？”她接着说，“我为什么到这里来？真的，我不知道。我并不怎么后悔看过那些信；它们让我明白了你的心，你的灵魂，还有——”","“How did it happen?” she continued, “how came I here?Truly, I do not know.I am tempted not to regret too much that I have read them; they have made me know your heart, your soul, and—” "
"“还有什么？”夏尔问。","“And what?” asked Charles."
"“你的计划，你需要一笔——”","“Your plans, your need of a sum—” "
"“我亲爱的堂姐——”","“My dear cousin—” "
"“嘘，嘘！堂弟，别这么大声，我们可不能吵醒了别人。看，”她一边说着，一边打开她的钱袋，“这是一个可怜姑娘的积蓄，她什么都不需要。夏尔，收下它们吧！今天早上，我还不知道钱的价值，是你教会了我。它终究只是个工具。堂弟差不多就是亲弟弟，你完全可以借你姐姐的钱袋用的。”","“Hush, hush! My cousin, not so loud; we must not wake others.See,” she said, opening her purse, “here are the savings of a poor girl who wants nothing.Charles, accept them!This morning I was ignorant of the value of money; you have taught it to me.It is but a means, after all.A cousin is almost a brother; you can surely borrow the purse of your sister.”"
"欧仁妮半是成年女子，半是小姑娘，从没想过会被人拒绝，可是她的堂弟却一直保持沉默。","Eugenie, as much a woman as a young girl, never dreamed of refusal; but her cousin remained silent."
"“哦！你不会拒绝吧？”欧仁妮大声说道，在那沉寂中都可以听见她的心跳声。","“Oh! You will not refuse?” cried Eugenie, the beatings of whose heart could be heard in the deep silence."
"她堂弟的迟疑让她感到窘迫，可是他身无分文的窘境在她脑海里变得更加清晰了，她便跪了下来。","Her cousin’s hesitation mortified her; but the sore need of his position came clearer still to her mind, and she knelt down."
"“你不拿那金子，我就永远不起来！”她说，“堂弟，我求求你，回答我！让我知道你是否尊重我，是否慷慨大度，是否——”","“I will never rise till you have taken that gold!” she said.“My cousin, I implore you, answer me! Let me know if you respect me, if you are generous, if—” "
"当听到这高尚的心灵发出这样悲痛的哭喊时，年轻人的眼泪落在了他堂姐的手上，他握住了她的手，不让她跪下。热泪洒落到欧仁妮身上时，她跳起来抓住钱袋，把里面的东西倒在桌上。","As he heard this cry of noble distress the young man’s tears fell upon his cousin’s hands, which he had caught in his own to keep her from kneeling.As the warm tears touched her, Eugenie sprang to the purse and poured its contents upon the table."
"“啊！是的，是的，你同意了？”她说着，高兴地流出了眼泪，“什么也别怕，堂弟，你会有钱的。这金子会给你带来幸福的，总有一天你会还给我的——那我们不就成了合伙人了？我会服从所有条件的。可是你不要把这份礼物看得太重了。”","“Ah! Yes, yes, you consent?” she said, weeping with joy.“Fear nothing, my cousin, you will be rich.This gold will bring you happiness; some day you shall bring it back to me,—are we not partners?I will obey all conditions.But you should not attach such value to the gift.”"
"夏尔终于能够表达自己的感受了。","Charles was at last able to express his feelings."
"“是的，欧仁妮，如果我不接受的话，确实我就会显得太小气了。不过——礼物换礼物，信任换信任。”","“Yes, Eugenie; my soul would be small indeed if I did not accept.And yet,—gift for gift, confidence for confidence.”"
"“你是什么意思？”她有些害怕，说道。","“What do you mean?” she said, frightened."
"“听着，亲爱的堂姐，我这里有——”他停了下来，指着五斗橱上一个外面包着皮套的方盒子。他接着说，“里面有个东西，对我来说，它和我的生命一样宝贵。这个盒子是我母亲送我的一件礼物。整整一天，我都在想，我母亲因为爱我而在这只梳妆箱上用掉了很多金子，如果她从坟墓里走出来，她会亲自把这些金子卖掉的；但要是我这么去做的话，这种行为在我看来就是大逆不道。”当听见最后几个字时，欧仁妮紧紧抓住了他的手。“不，”他们彼此眼含泪水深情地对望着，稍过片刻，他又说道，“不，我既不会卖了它，也不会冒险带着它上路。亲爱的欧仁妮，你将是它的守护者。朋友之间从来不会相互托付比这更神圣的东西了。我拿来给你看看吧。”","“Listen, dear cousin; I have here—” He interrupted himself to point out a square box covered with an outer case of leather which was on the drawers.“There,” he continued, “is something as precious to me as life itself.This box was a present from my mother.All day I have been thinking that if she could rise from her grave, she would herself sell the gold which her love for me lavished on this dressing-case; but were I to do so, the act would seem to me a sacrilege.”Eugenie pressed his hand as she heard these last words.“No,” he added, after a slight pause, during which a liquid glance of tenderness passed between them, “no, I will neither sell it nor risk its safety on my journey.Dear Eugenie, you shall be its guardian.Never did friend commit anything more sacred to another.Let me show it to you.”"
"他走过去，从封套中拿出盒子并打开，让他那快乐的堂姐看一个梳妆箱，其精美的工艺使这些金质装饰品的价值远远超过了它们的重量。","He went to the box, took it from its outer coverings, opened it, and showed his delighted cousin a dressing-case where the rich workmanship gave to the gold ornaments a value far above their weight."
"“你正欣赏的这个东西算不得什么，”他说着，按了一个隐藏的弹簧，打开了一个夹层，“这才是我眼里价值连城的东西。”他抽出两幅肖像，是米贝尔夫人的杰作，镶满了珍珠。","“What you admire there is nothing,” he said, pushing a secret spring which opened a hidden drawer.“Here is something which to me is worth the whole world.”He drew out two portraits, masterpieces of Madame Mirbel, richly set with pearls."
"“哦，太美了！你就是给这位夫人写信吧——”","“Oh, how beautiful!Is it the lady to whom you wrote that—” "
"“不，”他微笑着说，“这是我的母亲，这是我的父亲，你的婶婶和叔父。欧仁妮，我要跪下求你，好好保管我的宝贝。如果我死了，你的私房钱也没了，这金子和这些珍珠会补偿你的。这两幅肖像我只肯给你，你有资格保管它们。不过宁可最后把它们毁掉，也不要让它们落入别人的手中。”欧仁妮沉默了。“啊，是的，说是的！你同意了？”他神采动人地补充道。","“No,” he said, smiling, “this is my mother, and here is my father, your aunt and uncle.Eugenie, I beg you on my knees, keep my treasure safely.If I die and your little fortune is lost, this gold and these pearls will repay you.To you alone could I leave these portraits; you are worthy to keep them.But destroy them at last, so that they may pass into no other hands.”Eugenie was silent.“Ah, yes, say yes!You consent?” he added with winning grace."
"听到堂弟现在把她刚刚说的话又说给自己听，她深情地朝他看了一眼，那是她用恋爱女子的眼神看的第一眼——这一眼差不多既有妩媚，又有深情。他拉起她的手，吻了一下。","Hearing the very words she had just used to her cousin now addressed to herself, she turned upon him a look of love, her first look of loving womanhood,—a glance in which there is nearly as much of coquetry as of inmost depth.He took her hand and kissed it."
"“纯洁的天使！钱在我们两人之间是无所谓的，永远都不重要。感觉和情感从今以后就是一切。”","“Angel of purity! Between us two money is nothing, never can be anything.Feeling, sentiment, must be all henceforth.”"
"“你像你的母亲——她的声音跟你一样温柔吗？”","“You are like your mother,—was her voice as soft as yours?”"
"“哦！温柔多了——”","“Oh! Much softer—” "
"“是的，对你当然是啦，”她说着，垂下了眼睑，“去吧，夏尔，上床睡去吧，我希望你睡一会儿，你肯定累了。晚安。”她轻轻把手从堂弟手里抽出来，堂弟正用灯照着路，跟着她往她的房间走去。他们两人走到了门槛时——　","“Yes, for you,” she said, dropping her eyelids.“Come, Charles, go to bed; I wish it; you must be tired.Good night.”She gently disengaged her hand from those of her cousin, who followed her to her room, lighting the way.When they were both upon the threshold,—"
"“啊！”他说，“为什么我会倾家荡产呢？”","“Ah!” he said, “why am I ruined?”"
"“有什么关系？——我父亲有钱，我想是这样的。”她答道。","“What matter?—My father is rich; I think so,” she answered."
"“可怜的孩子！”夏尔迈步进了她的房间，背靠着墙，说道，“要是那样的话，他决不会让我父亲死的，他也不会让你过得这么穷困，他会过另外一种生活的。”","“Poor child!” said Charles, making a step into her room and leaning his back against the wall, “if that were so, he would never have let my father die; he would not let you live in this poor way; he would live otherwise himself.”"
"“可是他拥有弗罗瓦丰。”","“But he owns Froidfond.”"
"“弗罗瓦丰值多少钱？”","“What is Froidfond worth?”"
"“我不知道，不过他还有努瓦耶。”","“I don’t know; but he has Noyers.”"
"“那只不过是个穷田庄！”","“Nothing but a poor farm!”"
"“他有葡萄园和草场。”","“He has vineyards and fields.”"
"“不值什么钱的，”夏尔鄙夷地说道，“就算你父亲每年只有两万四千法郎，你觉得你会住在这么阴冷寒酸的房子里吗？”他往前迈了一步，接着说道，“啊！你是要把我的宝贝放在那里。”他一边说，一边瞥了一眼那个旧柜子，似乎想掩饰自己的想法。","“Mere nothing,” said Charles disdainfully.“If your father had only twenty-four thousand francs a year do you suppose you would live in this cold, barren room?” he added, making a step in advance.“Ah! There you will keep my treasures,” he said, glancing at the old cabinet, as if to hide his thoughts."
"“去睡吧。”她说道，不让他进自己凌乱的房间，。","“Go and sleep,” she said, hindering his entrance into the disordered room."
"夏尔退了出去，他们相互微笑着道了晚安。","Charles stepped back, and they bid each other goodnight with a mutual smile."
"两个人都睡着了，做着同样的梦；从那时起，这个年轻人的丧服上仿佛开始戴上了玫瑰。第二天早饭前，葛朗台太太发现女儿在花园里陪着夏尔。那个年轻人仍旧很悲伤，正如一个坠入不幸的可怜人估量到他掉进的苦海有多深，便明白他整个的未来生活会有可怕的重负那样。","Both fell asleep in the same dream; and from that moment the youth began to wear roses with his mourning.The next day, before breakfast, Madame Grandet found her daughter in the garden in company with Charles.The young man was still sad, as became a poor fellow who, plunged in misfortune, measures the depths of the abyss into which he has fallen, and sees the terrible burden of his whole future life."
"欧仁妮觉察到母亲脸上有不安的神情，便说道：“我父亲晚饭时才回家。”","“My father will not be home till dinner-time,” said Eugenie, perceiving the anxious look on her mother’s face."
"从这个年轻姑娘的面容、举止，以及她声音的异常柔美中，很容易看出她和她堂弟之间有一种思想上的默契。也许他们甚至还没有感觉出把他们连结到一起的那份感情的力量，就已经心心相印了。夏尔整个早晨都呆在大厅里，他暗自忧伤，谁也没去打搅他。三个女人各忙各的事。葛朗台忘了把事情交代好，结果许多人跑来干活——有管子工、砖瓦匠、铺石板的工匠、木匠、挖沟工人、装饰橱窗的人，还有佃户；有的来商谈维修费，有的来交租金，还有的来拿工钱。葛朗台太太和欧仁妮不得不跑来跑去，听所有这些工人和乡下人没完没了的唠叨。娜农把他们拿来抵租的农产品收拾到了厨房。她总要等她的主人发了令，才知道哪些要留在家里用，哪些要拿到市场上去卖。老头的习惯跟很多乡绅一样，就是喝劣质酒，吃烂水果。","It was easy to trace in the face and manners of the young girl and in the singular sweetness of her voice a unison of thought between her and her cousin.Their souls had espoused each other, perhaps before they even felt the force of the feelings which bound them together.Charles spent the morning in the hall, and his sadness was respected.Each of the three women had occupations of her own.Grandet had left all his affairs unattended to, and a number of persons came on business,—the plumber, the mason, the slater, the carpenter, the diggers, the dressers, the farmers; some to drive a bargain about repairs, others to pay their rent or to be paid themselves for services.Madame Grandet and Eugenie were obliged to go and come and listen to the interminable talk of all these workmen and country folk.Nanon put away in her kitchen the produce which they brought as tribute.She always waited for her master’s orders before she knew what portion was to be used in the house and what was to be sold in the market.It was the goodman’s custom, like that of a great many country gentlemen, to drink his bad wine and eat his spoiled fruit."
"下午快五点时，葛朗台从昂热回来了，他用他的金子换了一万四千法郎，用皮夹子揣回了王家债券，在他拿去投资购买公债之前，这些债券一直还有利息。他把科努瓦耶留在昂热照料那几匹差不多快要累死的马，他嘱咐科努瓦耶，等马歇过来之后再慢慢赶回家。　","Towards five in the afternoon Grandet returned from Angers, having made fourteen thousand francs by the exchange on his gold, bringing home in his wallet good treasury-notes which bore interest until the day he should invest them in the Funds.He had left Cornoiller at Angers to look after the horses, which were well-nigh foundered, with orders to bring them home slowly after they were rested."
"“我从昂热回来了，太太，”他说，“我饿了。”","“I have got back from Angers, wife,” he said, “I am hungry.”"
"娜农在厨房冲他大声喊道：","Nanon called out to him from the kitchen:"
"“打昨天起您就没吃过东西吧？”"," “Haven’t you eaten anything since yesterday?”"
"“什么也没吃。”老头答道。","“Nothing,” answered the old man."
"娜农端上来汤。就在一家人坐下来要吃晚饭时，德格拉桑来了，要听取他主顾的指示。葛朗台连看都没看他侄子一眼。","Nanon brought in the soup.Des Grassins came to take his client’s orders just as the family sat down to dinner.Grandet had not even observed his nephew."
"“接着吃，葛朗台，”银行家说，“我们能说话。你知道昂热的金价吗？他们从南特赶来要收买呢？我要拿一些我们的金子去抛售。”","“Go on eating, Grandet,” said the banker, “we can talk.Do you know what gold is worth in Angers?They have come from Nantes after it?I shall send some of ours.”"
"“别去，”葛朗台说，“他们拿的已经够多了。我们是老朋友了，我不能让你白白浪费时间。”","“Don’t send any,” said Grandet, “they have got enough.We are such old friends, I ought to save you from such a loss of time.”"
"“可金价是十三法郎五十生丁呢。”","“But gold is worth thirteen francs fifty centimes.”"
"“应该说‘曾经是’——”","“Say @was@ worth—” "
"“他们究竟是从哪里搞到的？”","“Where the devil have they got any?”"
"“我昨晚去昂热了。”葛朗台低声回答。","“I went to Angers last night,” answered Grandet in a low voice."
"银行家惊得一哆嗦。接着两个人悄声交谈了一番，其间葛朗台和德格拉桑频频地看着夏尔。不一会儿，德格拉桑显得十分惊诧，大概是葛朗台当时让他投资购买一年十万法郎的公债。","The banker shook with surprise.Then a whispered conversation began between the two, during which Grandet and des Grassins frequently looked at Charles.Presently des Grassins gave a start of astonishment; probably Grandet was then instructing him to invest the sum which was to give him a hundred thousand francs a year in the Funds."
"“葛朗台先生，”银行家对夏尔说，“我要去巴黎，如果你有事相托——”","“Monsieur Grandet,” said the banker to Charles, “I am starting for Paris; if you have any commissions—” "
"“没什么事，先生，谢谢您。”夏尔答道。","“None, monsieur, I thank you,” answered Charles."
"“要多谢谢他，侄儿。先生要去处理纪尧姆·葛朗台商号的事情。”","“Thank him better than that, nephew.Monsieur is going to settle the affairs of the house of Guillaume Grandet.”"
"“有希望吗？”夏尔急切地说。","“Is there any hope?” said Charles eagerly."
"“唉！”他伯父装着自豪的样子，感叹道，“你不是我侄儿吗？你的名誉就是我们的名誉。你不是也姓葛朗台吗？”","“What!” exclaimed his uncle, with well-acted pride, “are you not my nephew?Your honor is ours.Is not your name Grandet?”"
"夏尔站起来，抱住葛朗台老头，吻了吻他，然后夏尔脸色变得很苍白，离开了房间。欧仁妮钦佩地看着她的父亲。","Charles rose, seized Pere Grandet, kissed him, turned pale, and left the room.Eugenie looked at her father with admiration."
"“好吧，再见，德格拉桑，一切都拜托你了。尽可能好好诓诓那些人，牵住他们的鼻子。”","“Well, goodby, des Grassins; it is all in your hands.Decoy those people as best you can; lead ’em by the nose.”"
"两个能说会道的人握了握手。老箍桶匠陪着银行家走到前门。接着，他关上门，走回来，一屁股坐进了他的扶手椅，对娜农说——","The two diplomatists shook hands.The old cooper accompanied the banker to the front door.Then, after closing it, he came back and plunged into his armchair, saying to Nanon,—"
"“给我拿点黑藨子果仁甜酒。”","“Get me some black-currant ratafia.”"
"但是，他实在是太兴奋了，在一个地方坐不住，便站起身来，看着德拉贝尔特利耶先生的肖像，开始一边做着被娜农叫做舞步的动作，一边唱起来——","Too excited, however, to remain long in one place, he got up, looked at the portrait of Monsieur de la Bertelliere, and began to sing, doing what Nanon called his dancing steps,—"
"“在法国的近卫团里","“Dans les gardes francaises"
"我有一个好爸爸。”","J’avais un bon papa.”"
"娜农、葛朗台太太和欧仁妮相互看着，沉默不语。当这位男主人高兴到极点时，那高兴劲儿总是让她们感到害怕。晚会很快结束了。葛朗台老头决定早点上床睡觉，他一睡，其他人都得去睡，如同奥古斯塔斯一喝酒，整个波兰都要醉一样。这时，娜农、夏尔和欧仁妮三人疲惫的程度不亚于这位一家之主。至于葛朗台太太，她睡觉、吃喝，还有走路都是随着丈夫的意愿进行的。但是，在饭后消化的两个小时中，箍桶匠一辈子都没这么滑稽过，说了一大通他自己独有的格言警句——单单其中一句便显出了他的心有几寸几尺。他喝完果仁甜酒后，看着杯子，说道——","Nanon, Madame Grandet, and Eugenie looked at each other in silence.The hilarity of the master always frightened them when it reached its climax.The evening was soon over.Pere Grandet chose to go to bed early, and when he went to bed, everybody else was expected to go too; like as when Augustus drank, Poland was drunk.On this occasion Nanon, Charles, and Eugenie were not less tired than the master.As for Madame Grandet, she slept, ate, drank, and walked according to the will of her husband.However, during the two hours consecrated to digestion, the cooper, more facetious than he had ever been in his life, uttered a number of his own particular apothegms,—a single one of which will give the measure of his mind.When he had drunk his ratafia, he looked at his glass and said,—"
"“你的嘴刚放到杯子上，杯子就空了。这就是人生。你不可能有了。金子不会一边流通，一边还呆在你的钱包里。要不是这样的话，生活就太美好了。”","“You have no sooner put your lips to a glass than it is empty!Such is life.You can’t have and hold.Gold won’t circulate and stay in your purse.If it were not for that, life would be too fine.”"
"他友善快活、仁慈宽厚。当娜农搬着她的纺车进来时，“你一定累了，”他说，“把你的麻收拾起来吧。”","He was jovial and benevolent.When Nanon came with her spinning-wheel, “You must be tired,” he said, “put away your hemp.”"
"“啊，不行！那样我会瞌睡的。”她答道。","“Ah, bah! Then I shall get sleepy,” she answered."
"“可怜的娜农！你要不要喝点果仁甜酒？”","“Poor Nanon!Will you have some ratafia?”"
"“我不会拒绝一个善意的邀请，太太做的酒比药剂师做的强多了。他们卖的都是药。”","“I won’t refuse a good offer; madame makes it a deal better than the apothecaries.What they sell is all drugs.”"
"“他们放的糖太多，”这位主人说，“你就品不出别的味来了。”","“They put too much sugar,” said the master, “you can’t taste anything else.”"
"第九章","Chapter IX "
"第二天八点，全家人聚在一起吃早饭，家里真正呈现了一幅和睦融洽的画面。悲痛已经把葛朗台太太、欧仁妮和夏尔连在了一起，甚至连娜农也不知不觉地同情起来。这四个人现在成了一家人。至于那老头，他的贪欲得到了满足，并且确信很快就能摆脱那个花花公子，除了去南特的费用外，不用多花一分钱，所以虽然那个花花公子仍在家住着，他也不怎么在意了。他让那两个孩子——他称作夏尔和欧仁妮——在葛朗台太太的监督下，爱干什么就干什么。在公共和宗教道德方面，他是绝对信任太太的。他忙着修整路边草场和地沟的边界，在卢瓦尔河边种杨树，安排葡萄园冬天的活，还要操心弗罗瓦丰的事。所有这些事情占了他全部的时间。","The following day the family, meeting at eight o’clock for the early breakfast, made a picture of genuine domestic intimacy.Grief had drawn Madame Grandet, Eugenie, and Charles @en rapport@; even Nanon sympathized, without knowing why.The four now made one family.As to the old man, his satisfied avarice and the certainty of soon getting rid of the dandy without having to pay more than his journey to Nantes, made him nearly indifferent to his presence in the house.He left the two children, as he called Charles and Eugenie, free to conduct themselves as they pleased, under the eye of Madame Grandet, in whom he had implicit confidence as to all that concerned public and religious morality.He busied himself in straightening the boundaries of his fields and ditches along the high-road, in his poplar-plantations beside the Loire, in the winter work of his vineyards, and at Froidfond.All these things occupied his whole time."
"对于欧仁妮来说，爱情的春天已经来了。那天晚上她把自己的私房钱交给了堂弟，从这一幕发生之后，她的心就随着她的私房钱走了。作为保守同一个秘密的盟友，他们看着彼此，心领神会，这让他们的情感加深了，关系更默契、更亲密了，可以说，使他们置身于日常生活的范围之外。他们是近亲关系，他们不就理应语气柔和些、目光温柔些吗？欧仁妮乐于用对新生儿的爱来抚平她堂弟的痛苦。爱情的开始和生命的开始难道不是有着动人的相似之处吗？我们不是用最温柔的歌声和最柔和的目光来摇着婴儿吗？我们不是给他讲一些有关金灿灿的前程的美妙故事吗？她不是希望自己在他的头顶展开她那光辉灿烂的翅膀吗？难道他不是有着婴儿的喜怒无常，时而流下悲伤的泪水，时而流下喜悦的泪水吗？他不是为了琐碎之事而发愁，为了用于建造活动宫殿的美丽石子、为了摘下后就被遗忘的花朵而哭泣吗？他不是急切地想抓住时间，快步踏入人生吗？爱情是我们的第二次脱胎换骨。童年和爱情对欧仁妮和夏尔来说是一回事；它是第一次激情，带着种种的天真幼稚——让他们的心灵更觉得抚慰，因为他们的内心此时正被哀伤包裹着。　　他们的爱情从诞生起就在丧服的阴云下挣扎，倒是和这栋灰暗破败的宅子那朴素的外省风格更为协调了。他们在寂静的院子里靠着井边交谈，或者日落时在花园里徘徊，坐在长有青苔的凳子上互相不停地说着无关紧要的情话，或者在屋子和城墙间宁静的气氛中默想，就像在教堂的拱门下一样。这时夏尔才懂得了爱情的圣洁，因为他的贵妇，他亲爱的安妮特，只让他领略了爱情暴风雨般的骚动。此刻，他远离了世俗的情欲，那种卖弄风情、虚荣和艳丽俗气的情欲，转而追求真诚而纯洁的爱情。他甚至连这房子都喜欢上了，这里的生活习俗对他来说似乎也不再那么荒唐可笑了。他一大早就起了床，好在欧仁妮的父亲来分配粮食之前能跟她说一会儿话；当老头的脚步声在楼梯上响起来时，他便溜进花园。娜农装着没看见这天早上的约会，那小小的犯罪感给他们纯洁的爱情平添了诱人的魅力，有一种偷尝禁果的乐趣。","For Eugenie the springtime of love had come.Since the scene at night when she gave her little treasure to her cousin, her heart had followed the treasure.Confederates in the same secret, they looked at each other with a mutual intelligence which sank to the depth of their consciousness, giving a closer communion, a more intimate relation to their feelings, and putting them, so to speak, beyond the pale of ordinary life.Did not their near relationship warrant the gentleness in their tones, the tenderness in their glances?Eugenie took delight in lulling her cousin’s pain with the pretty childish joys of a new-born love.Are there no sweet similitudes between the birth of love and the birth of life?Do we not rock the babe with gentle songs and softest glances?Do we not tell it marvellous tales of the golden future?Hope herself, does she not spread her radiant wings above its head?Does it not shed, with infant fickleness, its tears of sorrow and its tears of joy?Does it not fret for trifles, cry for the pretty pebbles with which to build its shifting palaces, for the flowers forgotten as soon as plucked?Is it not eager to grasp the coming time, to spring forward into life?Love is our second transformation.Childhood and love were one and the same thing to Eugenie and to Charles; it was a first passion, with all its childlike play,—the more caressing to their hearts because they now were wrapped in sadness.Struggling at birth against the gloom of mourning, their love was only the more in harmony with the provincial plainness of that gray and ruined house.As they exchanged a few words beside the well in the silent court, or lingered in the garden for the sunset hour, sitting on a mossy seat saying to each other the infinite nothings of love, or mused in the silent calm which reigned between the house and the ramparts like that beneath the arches of a church, Charles comprehended the sanctity of love; for his great lady, his dear Annette, had taught him only its stormy troubles.At this moment he left the worldly passion, coquettish, vain, and showy as it was, and turned to the true, pure love.He loved even the house, whose customs no longer seemed to him ridiculous.He got up early in the mornings that he might talk with Eugenie for a moment before her father came to dole out the provisions; when the steps of the old man sounded on the staircase he escaped into the garden.The small criminality of this morning @tete-a-tete@ which Nanon pretended not to see, gave to their innocent love the lively charm of a forbidden joy."
"吃完早餐，等葛朗台去了他的草场和其他产业后，夏尔便跟母女俩呆在一起，为她们挽线，看她们做活，听她们轻声细语地闲谈，他从中体会到了从未有过的快乐。这种近乎修道院生活般的简朴向他展示了她们不谙尘世的灵魂之美，深深地打动了他。他原以为在法国不可能有这种品行，认为只在德国才有；而且即使有，在他看来，似乎也跟寓言似的，只存在于奥古斯特·拉方丹的小说里。很快，欧仁妮对他来说变成了歌德笔下的玛格丽特——是堕落之前的玛格丽特。一天又一天，他的话语、他的模样令这可怜的姑娘着迷，她愉快地任由爱河的波流摆布，毫无反抗；她抓住自己的幸福，就像游泳的人抓住一根悬伸的柳枝，好把自己从河里拉出来，上岸躺下休息一样。因担忧即将到来的离别，那飞逝而去的快乐时光不是也显得忧伤了吗？每一天，总有一些小事提醒他们分别即将到来。","After breakfast, when Grandet had gone to his fields and his other occupations, Charles remained with the mother and daughter, finding an unknown pleasure in holding their skeins, in watching them at work, in listening to their quiet prattle.The simplicity of this half-monastic life, which revealed to him the beauty of these souls, unknown and unknowing of the world, touched him keenly.He had believed such morals impossible in France, and admitted their existence nowhere but in Germany; even so, they seemed to him fabulous, only real in the novels of Auguste Lafontaine.Soon Eugenie became to him the Margaret of Goethe—before her fall.Day by day his words, his looks enraptured the poor girl, who yielded herself up with delicious non-resistance to the current of love; she caught her happiness as a swimmer seizes the overhanging branch of a willow to draw himself from the river and lie at rest upon its shore.Did no dread of a coming absence sadden the happy hours of those fleeting days?Daily some little circumstance reminded them of the parting that was at hand."
"德格拉桑走了三天后，葛朗台把他侄子带到了民事法庭，以庄重的形式——乡下人对所有法律事务一向如此——签一份放弃对他父亲财产继承权的契约。可怕的放弃声明书！简直就是一种背叛家门的行为！夏尔还去了克吕绍公证人那里办了两份授权书——一份给德格拉桑，另一份是给受托代售其财物的朋友。之后，他办理了领取出国护照所需的所有手续；最后，等收到了从巴黎定制的简单孝服后，他派人叫来了索米尔的裁缝，把没用的衣服都卖给了他。最后这一做法让葛朗台极为高兴。","Three days after the departure of des Grassins, Grandet took his nephew to the Civil courts, with the solemnity which country people attach to all legal acts, that he might sign a deed surrendering his rights in his father’s estate.Terrible renunciation! Species of domestic apostasy!Charles also went before Maitre Cruchot to make two powers of attorney,—one for des Grassins, the other for the friend whom he had charged with the sale of his belongings.After that he attended to all the formalities necessary to obtain a passport for foreign countries; and finally, when he received his simple mourning clothes from Paris, he sent for the tailor of Saumur and sold to him his useless wardrobe.This last act pleased Grandet exceedingly."
"“啊！现在你看着像个准备闯荡一番发大财的人了，”当夏尔穿着一件纯黑布的礼服出现时，他说，“好！很好！”","“Ah! Now you look like a man prepared to embark and make your fortune,” he said, when Charles appeared in a surtout of plain black cloth.“Good! Very good!”"
"“我希望您能相信，先生，”他侄子答道，“我会一直努力去适应我的处境的。”","“I hope you will believe, monsieur,” answered his nephew, “that I shall always try to conform to my situation.”"
"“那是什么？”当看见夏尔拿着一把金子时，他伯父的眼睛一亮，说道。","“What’s that?” said his uncle, his eyes lighting up at a handful of gold which Charles was carrying."
"“先生，我把我所有的纽扣、戒指和其他值点钱的小零碎都收集到一起了，可是我在索米尔谁也不认识，我想请您——”","“Monsieur, I have collected all my buttons and rings and other superfluities which may have some value; but not knowing any one in Saumur, I wanted to ask you to—” "
"“买下这些东西？”葛朗台打断他，说道。","“To buy them?” said Grandet, interrupting him."
"“不，伯父，您只要给介绍我一个诚实的人——”","“No, uncle; only to tell me of an honest man who—” "
"“把那些东西给我，我要上楼去估算一下它们的价值，我会回来告诉你个数，分毫不差。首饰金，”他仔细查看着一条长项链，“十八或者十九克拉。”","“Give me those things, I will go upstairs and estimate their value; I will come back and tell you what it is to a fraction.Jeweller’s gold,” examining a long chain, “eighteen or nineteen carats.”"
"老头伸出他的大手，接过那把金子，并拿走了。","The goodman held out his huge hand and received the mass of gold, which he carried away."
"“堂姐，”葛朗台说，“我能把这两颗纽扣送给你吗？它们可以用来系戴在你手腕上的丝带，这种手镯现在很流行。”","“Cousin,” said Grandet, “may I offer you these two buttons?They can fasten ribbons round your wrists; that sort of bracelet is much the fashion just now.”"
"“那就不客气了，我收下。”她会意地望了他一眼，回答道。","“I accept without hesitation,” she answered, giving him an understanding look."
"“伯母，这是我母亲的顶针，我一直小心地珍藏在我的梳妆箱里。”夏尔说着，把一个漂亮的金顶针送给葛朗台太太，她很多年来都盼望着能有这么一个金顶针。","“Aunt, here is my mother’s thimble; I have always kept it carefully in my dressing-case,” said Charles, presenting a pretty gold thimble to Madame Grandet, who for many years had longed for one."
"“我不知道该怎么谢你，什么话都表达不了，我的侄子，”可怜的母亲眼里满含着泪水，说道，“早晚祷告时，我会为你多做一个祷告，是最真诚的祈祷——祝出门在外的人平安。如果我死了，欧仁妮会为你保管这个宝贝的。”","“I cannot thank you; no words are possible, my nephew,” said the poor mother, whose eyes filled with tears.“Night and morning in my prayers I shall add one for you, the most earnest of all—for those who travel.If I die, Eugenie will keep this treasure for you.”"
"“这些东西值九百八十九法郎七十五生丁，”葛朗台推开门，说道，“我先垫上钱——用里弗赫，省得你还得费事拿去卖。”","“They are worth nine hundred and eighty-nine francs, seventy-five centimes,” said Grandet, opening the door.“To save you the pain of selling them, I will advance the money—in @livres@.”"
"里弗赫这个词在卢瓦尔河沿岸是指面值六里弗赫的克朗硬币算作六法郎，不打折扣。","The word @livres@ on the littoral of the Loire signifies that crown prices of six @livres@ are to be accepted as six francs without deduction."
"“我不敢开口请您买下，”夏尔回答，“可是要在您住的城里把我的首饰变卖给二手商，我觉得很难堪。拿破仑说过，脏衣服应该在家里洗。我感谢您的好意。”","“I dared not propose it to you,” answered Charles, “but it was most repugnant to me to sell my jewels to some second-hand dealer in your own town.People should wash their dirty linen at home, as Napoleon said.I thank you for your kindness.”"
"葛朗台挠挠耳朵，一时间谁也没说话。","Grandet scratched his ear, and there was a moment’s silence."
"“我亲爱的伯父，”夏尔用一副不安的神情看着他，好像担心会伤害到他的感情，继续说道，“我的伯母和堂姐已经赏脸收下了我的小纪念品。能允许我把这些袖扣送给您吗？这些东西现在对我来说没用了。它们会让您想起一个可怜的男孩，他远在异乡，将时刻惦念着那些从今以后就是他的亲人的人们。”","“My dear uncle,” resumed Charles, looking at him with an uneasy air, as if he feared to wound his feelings, “my aunt and cousin have been kind enough to accept a trifling remembrance of me.Will you allow me to give you these sleeve-buttons, which are useless to me now?They will remind you of a poor fellow who, far away, will always think of those who are henceforth all his family.”"
"“我的孩子，我的孩子，你可不能就这样送个精光！让我看看，太太，你拿了什么？”他急切地转向她，又说道，“啊！一个金顶针。还有你，小姑娘？啊！钻石扣子？是的，我会收下你的礼物的，侄儿，”他一边回答，一边握住了夏尔的手，“但是——你一定要让我——付给——你——是的，你到西印度的路费。是的，我想给你出路费，因为——你知道吗，我的孩子——在给你的珠宝估价时，我只估算了金子的重量，那工艺很有可能也值些钱的。所以咱们这么办吧，我给你一千五百法郎——用里弗赫，克吕绍会借给我钱的。我这儿一个铜子儿也没有——除非佩罗泰把钱还上，他还欠着租金呢。顺便提一句，我这就去见他。”","“My lad, my lad, you mustn’t rob yourself this way!Let me see, wife, what have you got?” he added, turning eagerly to her.“Ah! A gold thimble.And you, little girl?What! Diamond buttons?Yes, I’ll accept your present, nephew,” he answered, shaking Charles by the hand.“But—you must let me—pay—your—yes, your passage to the Indies.Yes, I wish to pay your passage because—d’ye see, my boy?—in valuing your jewels I estimated only the weight of the gold; very likely the workmanship is worth something.So let us settle it that I am to give you fifteen hundred francs—in @livres@; Cruchot will lend them to me.I haven’t got a copper farthing here,—unless Perrotet, who is behindhand with his rent, should pay up.By the bye, I’ll go and see him.”"
"他拿起他的帽子，戴上手套，出去了。","He took his hat, put on his gloves, and went out."
"“这么说，你真的要走了？”欧仁妮对她的堂弟说道，神情既忧伤又钦佩。","“Then you are really going?” said Eugenie to her cousin, with a sad look, mingled with admiration."
"“我必须走。”他说着，低下了头。","“I must,” he said, bowing his head."
"几天来，夏尔整个人的态度、举止和言谈都变了，好像一个人尽管悲痛万分，却感到责任重大，并拥有了从不幸中汲取勇气的力量。他不再抱怨了；他已成了一个男子汉。当看到堂弟穿着与他苍白的脸色和忧郁的面容十分相称的纯黑礼服下楼时，欧仁妮对他的性格更加了解了。那天，两个女人穿上了她们各自的丧服，然后三人一起参加了在教区教堂为已故的纪尧姆·葛朗台举行的追思弥撒。","For some days past, Charles’s whole bearing, manners, and speech had become those of a man who, in spite of his profound affliction, feels the weight of immense obligations and has the strength to gather courage from misfortune.He no longer repined; he became a man.Eugenie never augured better of her cousin’s character than when she saw him come down in the plain black clothes which suited well with his pale face and sombre countenance.On that day the two women put on their own mourning, and all three assisted at a Requiem celebrated in the parish church for the soul of the late Guillaume Grandet."
"午饭时，夏尔收到了从巴黎来的信，开始读起来。","At the second breakfast Charles received letters from Paris and began to read them."
"“喂，堂弟，你对事情的处理还满意吧？”欧仁妮低声说。","“Well, cousin, are you satisfied with the management of your affairs?” said Eugenie in a low voice."
"“千万别问这种问题，我的女儿，”葛朗台说，“见鬼！我给你讲过我的事吗？你干嘛要管你堂弟的事？别打扰那孩子！”","“Never ask such questions, my daughter,” said Grandet.“What the devil! Do I tell you my affairs?Why do you poke your nose into your cousin’s?Let the lad alone!”"
"“哦！我没什么秘密。”夏尔说。","“Oh! I haven’t any secrets,” said Charles."
"“得，得，得，得，侄儿，你很快就会发现，做生意你一定要管住嘴。”","“Ta, ta, ta, ta, nephew; you’ll soon find out that you must hold your tongue in business.”"
"当两个情人单独呆在花园里时，夏尔拉着欧仁妮坐在胡桃树下的旧长凳上，对她说——　","When the two lovers were alone in the garden, Charles said to Eugenie, drawing her down on the old bench beneath the walnut-tree,—"
"“我委托阿方斯是对的，他干得很棒。他很谨慎、很忠诚地处理了我的事。现在我在巴黎没债务了。我所有的东西都卖掉了。他告诉我，他听取了一位老船长的建议，花三千法郎买了一批欧洲的稀罕小玩意儿，将来卖到西印度肯定会畅销的。他已经把我的行李寄到了南特，在那里有一艘货船驶往圣多明各。欧仁妮，五天后，我们就要道别了——也许是永别，至少也要好多年。我的那批货，还有两个朋友寄给我的一万法郎，算是一笔小小的本钱。我看得好多年以后才能回来。亲爱的堂姐，不要把你的一生和我的一生放在一个秤盘里，我可能会死，别人会给你提门好亲事的——”","“I did right to trust Alphonse; he has done famously.He has managed my affairs with prudence and good faith.I now owe nothing in Paris.All my things have been sold; and he tells me that he has taken the advice of an old sea-captain and spent three thousand francs on a commercial outfit of European curiosities which will be sure to be in demand in the Indies.He has sent my trunks to Nantes, where a ship is loading for San Domingo.In five days, Eugenie, we must bid each other farewell—perhaps forever, at least for years.My outfit and ten thousand francs, which two of my friends send me, are a very small beginning.I cannot look to return for many years.My dear cousin, do not weight your life in the scales with mine; I may perish; some good marriage may be offered to you—” "
"“你爱我吗？”她说。","“Do you love me?” she said."
"“哦，是的！的确，是的！”他语重心长地答道。","“Oh, yes! Indeed, yes!” he answered, with a depth of tone that revealed an equal depth of feeling."
"“我会等的，夏尔——天哪！我父亲在他的窗口呢。”她说着，推开了她的堂弟，他正凑过来要吻她。","“I shall wait, Charles—Good heavens!There is my father at his window,” she said, repulsing her cousin, who leaned forward to kiss her."
"她很快跑到拱门下。夏尔跟着她跑过来。欧仁妮看见他，便退到楼梯脚下，打开了那个弹簧门；接着她漫无目的地来到了娜农的小屋附近的角落——过道里最黑暗的尽头。到了那里，夏尔抓住了她的手，把她拉进了怀里。他伸出胳膊搂住她的腰，让她轻轻地靠在自己的身上。欧仁妮不再抗拒，她接受并且给予了最纯洁、最甜蜜，而且也是最倾心相与的亲吻。","She ran quickly under the archway.Charles followed her.When she saw him, she retreated to the foot of the staircase and opened the swing-door; then, scarcely knowing where she was going, Eugenie reached the corner near Nanon’s den, in the darkest end of the passage.There Charles caught her hand and drew her to his heart.Passing his arm about her waist, he made her lean gently upon him.Eugenie no longer resisted; she received and gave the purest, the sweetest, and yet, withal, the most unreserved of kisses."
"“亲爱的欧仁妮，堂兄弟比亲兄弟要好，因为他可以娶你。”夏尔说。","“Dear Eugenie, a cousin is better than a brother, for he can marry you,” said Charles."
"“一言为定！”娜农推开了她那黑屋子的门，大声喊道。","“So be it!” cried Nanon, opening the door of her lair."
"这对情侣吃了一惊，逃进了大厅，欧仁妮拿起了她的活计，夏尔开始读起葛朗台太太的祈祷书中《圣母经》的祷告词。","The two lovers, alarmed, fled into the hall, where Eugenie took up her work and Charles began to read the litanies of the @Virgin@ in Madame Grandet’s prayer-book."
"“哟！”娜农大声说，“现在他们正在祷告呢。”","“Mercy!” cried Nanon, “now they’re saying their prayers.”"
"夏尔一宣布他即将动身，葛朗台便忙活起来，以证明他对侄子有多关心。凡是不用他花钱的事他都变得很大方。他煞费苦心找来一个装箱工人，又说那个人的箱子要价太高，于是决定自己动手用旧木板做箱子。他一大早就起了床，把板条校准、刨平、钉好，做成了几个让他满意的结实箱子。他把夏尔的东西全装进去，然后亲自张罗着把箱子送上卢瓦尔河上的船，给它们上了保险，以便把它们准时送达南特。","As soon as Charles announced his immediate departure, Grandet bestirred himself to testify much interest in his nephew.He became very liberal of all that cost him nothing; took pains to find a packer; declared the man asked too much for his cases; insisted on making them himself out of old planks; got up early in the morning to fit and plane and nail together the strips, out of which he made, to his own satisfaction, some strong cases, in which he packed all Charles’s effects; he also took upon himself to send them by boat down the Loire, to insure them, and get them to Nantes in proper time."
"自从过道里的一吻之后，对欧仁妮来说，时间过得快得吓人。有时她想跟着堂弟走。凡是领略过最难舍难分的爱情的人——那爱情的持续期因时间、年龄、不治之症、机缘和厄运而一天短似一天——他们会理解这可怜的姑娘有多苦恼。她在花园里边走边哭，如今这花园，实际上还有院子、房子、城市，对她来说，都好像太狭窄了。她想象自己已经起航驶入了他即将横渡的那片浩瀚的海洋。终于到了他出发的前夜。那天早晨，趁葛朗台和娜农都不在，他们把装着那两张肖像的宝贝箱子郑重其事地安放进旧衣柜唯一能锁住的抽屉里，那里面放着现在已经空了的丝绒钱袋。存放时，他们哭了又哭，吻了又吻。当欧仁妮把钥匙放进她的胸口时，她已没有勇气阻止夏尔贴上去的亲吻。","After the kiss taken in the passage, the hours fled for Eugenie with frightful rapidity.Sometimes she thought of following her cousin.Those who have known that most endearing of all passions,—the one whose duration is each day shortened by time, by age, by mortal illness, by human chances and fatalities,—they will understand the poor girl’s tortures.She wept as she walked in the garden, now so narrow to her, as indeed the court, the house, the town all seemed.She launched in thought upon the wide expanse of the ocean he was about to traverse.At last the eve of his departure came.That morning, in the absence of Grandet and of Nanon, the precious case which contained the two portraits was solemnly installed in the only drawer of the old cabinet which could be locked, where the now empty velvet purse was lying.This deposit was not made without a goodly number of tears and kisses.When Eugenie placed the key within her bosom she had no courage to forbid the kiss with which Charles sealed the act."
"“它永远不会离开那个地方的，我的朋友。”她说。","“It shall never leave that place, my friend,” she said."
"“那我的心将一直留在那里。”","“Then my heart will be always there.”"
"“啊！夏尔，这样不好。”她说，仿佛是在责备他。","“Ah! Charles, it is not right,” she said, as though she blamed him."
"“我们不是结婚了吗？”他说，“我已经有了你的许诺——那么请接受我的许诺吧。”","“Are we not married?” he said.“I have thy promise,—then take mine.”"
"“你的，我永远是你的！”他们二人把这句话都连说了两遍。","“Thine; I am thine forever!” they each said, repeating the words twice over."
"世上没有比这更纯洁的誓言了。欧仁妮的纯真诚挚刹那间使这个年轻人的爱情变得神圣了。","No promise made upon this earth was ever purer.The innocent sincerity of Eugenie had sanctified for a moment the young man’s love."
"第二天，早餐的气氛很悲伤。尽管收下了夏尔赠送的绣金睡袍和挂在胸前的让内特十字架，娜农还是热泪盈眶。","On the morrow the breakfast was sad.Nanon herself, in spite of the gold-embroidered robe and the Jeannette cross bestowed by Charles, had tears in her eyes."
"“可怜的好先生，要漂洋过海了——哦，但愿上帝能指引他！”","“The poor dear monsieur who is going on the seas—oh, may God guide him!”"
"十点半，全家人出门送夏尔去乘坐到南特的驿车。娜农放了狗，锁上门，坚持要拿上年轻人的旅行包。曲曲折折的老街上，所有的商人都站在他们的店铺门口看这一行人。到了市场时，克吕绍公证人也加入了他们的行列。","At half-past ten the whole family started to escort Charles to the diligence for Nantes.Nanon let loose the dog, locked the door, and insisted on carrying the young man’s carpet-bag.All the tradesmen in the tortuous old street were on the sill of their shop-doors to watch the procession, which was joined in the market-place by Maitre Cruchot."
"“欧仁妮，一定不要哭。”她母亲说道。","“Eugenie, be sure you don’t cry,” said her mother."
"“侄儿，”葛朗台站在驿车出发的客栈门口，吻了吻夏尔的两颊，说道，“穷着走，富着回，你会发现你父亲的名誉完好无损。我向你保证这一点，我——葛朗台，因为将来只能靠你来——”","“Nephew,” said Grandet, in the doorway of the inn from which the coach started, kissing Charles on both cheeks, “depart poor, return rich; you will find the honor of your father safe.I answer for that myself, I—Grandet; for it will only depend on you to—” "
"“啊！伯父，您减轻了我离别的伤心。这不就是您送给我的最好的礼物吗？”","“Ah! My uncle, you soften the bitterness of my departure.Is it not the best gift that you could make me?”"
"夏尔就这样打断了他伯父的话，根本没听懂话里的意思。他在那个老守财奴深褐色的脸颊上滴下了感激的泪水，而欧仁妮则用尽全力握紧了她堂弟和她父亲的手。公证人露出了微笑，很佩服那老头狡诈的一番话，只有他一个人听明白了意思。一家人站在驿车四周，直到车子出发；接着，等到驿车在桥上消失，那隆隆声在远处变得越来越小的时候，葛朗台说：","Not understanding his uncle’s words which he had thus interrupted, Charles shed tears of gratitude upon the tanned cheeks of the old miser, while Eugenie pressed the hand of her cousin and that of her father with all her strength.The notary smiled, admiring the sly speech of the old man, which he alone had understood.The family stood about the coach until it started; then as it disappeared upon the bridge, and its rumble grew fainter in the distance, Grandet said: "
"“再见了！”","“Goodby to you!”"
"幸而只有克吕绍公证人听到了这声欢呼。欧仁妮和她母亲已经去了码头一个还能看见驿车的角落，挥着她们的白手绢，夏尔也挥着自己的手绢做出回应。","Happily no one but Maitre Cruchot heard the exclamation.Eugenie and her mother had gone to a corner of the quay from which they could still see the diligence and wave their white handkerchiefs, to which Charles made answer by displaying his."
"“啊！母亲，我真希望能有上帝的法力，哪怕就一会儿。”当再也看不到爱人的手绢时，欧仁妮说。","“Ah! Mother, would that I had the power of God for a single moment,” said Eugenie, when she could no longer see her lover’s handkerchief."
"为了能一口气把葛朗台家里接二连三要发生的事件讲完，有必要先交待一下老头委托德格拉桑先生在巴黎所办理的各种事宜。德格拉桑先生离开索米尔一个月之后，葛朗台从投资公债中拿到了一年十万法郎的登记证，那公债是以净价八十法郎一股买的。在他死后，财产清单所列的明细表没有解释这个生性多疑的人是如何把买公债的钱拨去，又是如何由此拿到登记证的。克吕绍公证人认为，娜农不知不觉地成了可靠的运款工具；因为就在这段时间，她有五天不在家，借口是去弗罗瓦丰收拾东西——倒好像那老头真能把东西乱丢乱放似的！","Not to interrupt the current of events which are about to take place in the bosom of the Grandet family, it is necessary to cast a forestalling eye upon the various operations which the goodman carried on in Paris by means of Monsieur des Grassins.A month after the latter’s departure from Saumur, Grandet, became possessed of a certificate of a hundred thousand francs a year from his investment in the Funds, bought at eighty francs net.The particulars revealed at his death by the inventory of his property threw no light upon the means which his suspicious nature took to remit the price of the investment and receive the certificate thereof.Maitre Cruchot was of opinion that Nanon, unknown to herself, was the trusty instrument by which the money was transported; for about this time she was absent five days, under a pretext of putting things to rights at Froidfond,—as if the goodman were capable of leaving anything lying about or out of order!"
"至于所有涉及纪尧姆·葛朗台商号的事，全都是不折不扣按照老箍桶匠的打算进行的。众所周知，法兰西银行对巴黎及外省的巨富提供有准确的信息。德格拉桑和索米尔的费利克斯·葛朗台的名字都榜上有名，而且他们像那些拥有大片地产而没有抵押出去的金融界名人一样，很受敬重。索米尔银行家的到来，据说是为了体面地清偿巴黎葛朗台的债务，这足以使那位已故商人的名声免受被债权人签署拒付通知书的羞辱。财产上的封条当着债权人的面被撕了下来，葛朗台雇用的公证人马上着手开列财产清单。不久之后，德格拉桑召集债权人开会，他们一致推举他，连同一家大银行的老板，同时也是主要债权人之一的弗朗索瓦·凯勒为清算人，全权负责保护葛朗台家族的名誉和债权人的利益。索米尔葛朗台的信誉，加上通过德格拉桑之口在所有相关人员头脑中散播的希望，使得处理过程极为顺利。没有一个债权人表示异议，也没有人想过要把债权放到盈亏帐上算一算，所有人都很有信心地说：“索米尔的葛朗台会偿还的。”","In all that concerned the business of the house of Guillaume Grandet the old cooper’s intentions were fulfilled to the letter.The Bank of France, as everybody knows, affords exact information about all the large fortunes in Paris and the provinces.The names of des Grassins and Felix Grandet of Saumur were well known there, and they enjoyed the esteem bestowed on financial celebrities whose wealth comes from immense and unencumbered territorial possessions.The arrival of the Saumur banker for the purpose, it was said, of honorably liquidating the affairs of Grandet of Paris, was enough to avert the shame of protested notes from the memory of the defunct merchant.The seals on the property were taken off in presence of the creditors, and the notary employed by Grandet went to work at once on the inventory of the assets.Soon after this, des Grassins called a meeting of the creditors, who unanimously elected him, conjointly with Francois Keller, the head of a rich banking-house and one of those principally interested in the affair, as liquidators, with full power to protect both the honor of the family and the interests of the claimants.The credit of Grandet of Saumur, the hopes he diffused by means of des Grassins in the minds of all concerned, facilitated the transactions.Not a single creditor proved recalcitrant; no one thought of passing his claim to his profit-and-loss account; each and all said confidently, “Grandet of Saumur will pay.”"
"六个月过去了。那些巴黎人已经把到期的流通债券赎了回来，放到他们的书桌里，并锁了起来。这是老箍桶匠要达到的第一个目的！第一次集会九个月之后，两位清算人给每个债权人发放了百分之四十七的债款。这笔钱是靠变卖已故的纪尧姆·葛朗台所拥有的证券、资产及其他所有物获得的，偿还手续严谨诚实。清算办理得无可指摘，极为公正。债权人非常感谢葛朗台家族所展示的杰出的、无可置疑的信誉。这番赞美之词传颂了一段时间之后，债权人要求偿还余下的债款。必须集体写封信给索米尔的葛朗台。","Six months went by.The Parisians had redeemed the notes in circulation as they fell due, and held them under lock and key in their desks.First result aimed at by the old cooper!Nine months after this preliminary meeting, the two liquidators distributed forty-seven per cent to each creditor on his claim.This amount was obtained by the sale of the securities, property, and possessions of all kinds belonging to the late Guillaume Grandet, and was paid over with scrupulous fidelity.Unimpeachable integrity was shown in the transaction.The creditors gratefully acknowledged the remarkable and incontestable honor displayed by the Grandets.When these praises had circulated for a certain length of time, the creditors asked for the rest of their money.It became necessary to write a collective letter to Grandet of Saumur."
"“终于来了！”老头一边把信扔到火里，一边说道，“要有耐心，我的好朋友们！”","“Here it comes!” said the old man as he threw the letter into the fire.“Patience, my good friends!”"
"对信中所提的建议，索米尔葛朗台的答复是要求所有他兄弟遗产的债权凭单，连同抵付的百分之四十七的清欠收据，都应存放到一个公证人那里；他提这个要求的借口是要核对账目，弄清遗产的确切状况。这立刻引发了各种争议。一般来讲，债权人是一种性情古怪的家伙，今天准备签协议了，第二天又嚷着烧呀杀呀的，再后来，他又变得友善而随和了。今天，他的妻子心情愉快，他最小的婴儿长了第一颗牙，家里一切顺利，他便决心一个子儿也不让；第二天下了雨，他出不了门，心里烦闷，只要能让事情有个了结，任何一个要求他都会答应；第三天，他宣布他必须要担保；到月底，他想要欠债人的脑袋，在心里头已变成了个刽子手。","In answer to the proposals contained in the letter, Grandet of Saumur demanded that all vouchers for claims against the estate of his brother should be deposited with a notary, together with acquittances for the forty-seven per cent already paid; he made this demand under pretence of sifting the accounts and finding out the exact condition of the estate.It roused at once a variety of difficulties.Generally speaking, the creditor is a species of maniac, ready to agree to anything one day, on the next breathing fire and slaughter; later on, he grows amicable and easygoing.Today his wife is good-humored, his last baby has cut its first tooth, all is well at home, and he is determined not to lose a sou; on the morrow it rains, he can’t go out, he is gloomy, he says yes to any proposal that is made to him, so long as it will put an end to the affair; on the third day he declares he must have guarantees; by the end of the month he wants his debtor’s head, and becomes at heart an executioner."
"债权人很像麻雀，易于相信别人的孩子们会被怂恿往它的尾巴上放盐——区别是，债权人把债权看成那个麻雀，结果永远无利可图。葛朗台早已研究过债权人的情绪变化，而他兄弟的债主们证实了他的种种推测没有错。有些人生气了，断然拒绝交出他们的债权凭单。","The creditor is a good deal like the sparrow on whose tail confiding children are invited to put salt,—with this difference, that he applies the image to his claim, the proceeds of which he is never able to lay hold of.Grandet had studied the atmospheric variations of creditors, and the creditors of his brother justified all his calculations.Some were angry, and flatly refused to give in their vouchers."
"“很好，再好不过了。”葛朗台一边说，一边用手搓着德格拉桑写明此事的那封信。","“Very good; so much the better,” said Grandet, rubbing his hands over the letter in which des Grassins announced the fact."
"还有些人同意这个要求，但条件是他们的权利要得到充分保障；他们声明不放弃任何权利，甚至保留最终强制破产的权力。就此事开始了长时间的书信往来，最后索米尔的葛朗台同意了所有的条件。凭借这一让步，宽容的债主们说服了那些持反对意见的债主。然后，尽管仍有各种不满的声音，债券还是被存放了。","Others agreed to the demand, but only on condition that their rights should be fully guaranteed; they renounced none, and even reserved the power of ultimately compelling a failure.On this began a long correspondence, which ended in Grandet of Saumur agreeing to all conditions.By means of this concession the placable creditors were able to bring the dissatisfied creditors to reason.The deposit was then made, but not without sundry complaints."
"“你那个老头，”他们对德格拉桑说，“在哄骗我们。”","“Your goodman,” they said to des Grassins, “is tricking us.”"
"纪尧姆·葛朗台死后二十三个月，许多债主被巴黎市场更繁忙的业务搞得晕头转向，早已忘掉了葛朗台的债务，有的只是在想起来时说：","Twenty-three months after the death of Guillaume Grandet many of the creditors, carried away by more pressing business in the markets of Paris, had forgotten their Grandet claims, or only thought of them to say: "
"“我开始相信，百分之四十七就是我能拿到的全部债款了。”","“I begin to believe that forty-seven per cent is all I shall ever get out of that affair.”"
"老箍桶匠早就对时间的能力做过计算，正如他过去常说的，时间真是个不错的魔鬼。到了第三年年底，德格拉桑写信给葛朗台说，他已经让债权人同意放弃葛朗台商号仍然结欠的两百四十万法郎中的百分之十。葛朗台回信说，因可耻的破产而害死他兄弟的那个公证人和经纪人仍然活着，他们现在可能已恢复了信用，应该起诉他们，这样就可以让他们拿出些钱来减少拖欠的总数目。","The old cooper had calculated on the power of time, which, as he used to say, is a pretty good devil after all.By the end of the third year des Grassins wrote to Grandet that he had brought the creditors to agree to give up their claims for ten per cent on the two million four hundred thousand francs still due by the house of Grandet.Grandet answered that the notary and the broker whose shameful failures had caused the death of his brother were still living, that they might now have recovered their credit, and that they ought to be sued, so as to get something out of them towards lessening the total of the deficit."
"第四年年末，债务的总数被确切地估算为一百二十万法郎。债权人和清算人之间、清算人和葛朗台之间进行了多次谈判，历时六个多月。长话短说，大约在第四年的第九个月，索米尔的葛朗台这时急于摆脱这件事，便告诉清算人，他的侄子在西印度发了财，愿意还清他父亲的全部债务；因而，他不能事先不跟侄子商量就擅自了结；他已经给他侄子写了信，正等着回信呢。","By the end of the fourth year the liabilities were definitely estimated at a sum of twelve hundred thousand francs.Many negotiations, lasting over six months, took place between the creditors and the liquidators, and between the liquidators and Grandet.To make a long story short, Grandet of Saumur, anxious by this time to get out of the affair, told the liquidators, about the ninth month of the fourth year, that his nephew had made a fortune in the Indies and was disposed to pay his father’s debts in full; he therefore could not take upon himself to make any settlement without previously consulting him; he had written to him, and was expecting an answer."
"直到第五年年中，债权人还是被“全部还清”这几个字搪塞着，奸诈的老守财奴不时地把这几个字说出来，同时暗暗觉得好笑，他带着微笑咒骂道：“那些巴黎人！”","The creditors were held in check until the middle of the fifth year by the words, “payment in full,” which the wily old miser threw out from time to time as he laughed in his beard, saying with a smile and an oath, “Those Parisians!”"
"可是债权人的命运却是商业年鉴里从未有过的例子。这段历史事件让他们再一次出现在人们的视线中时，人们发现他们仍旧处在葛朗台最初就决意给他们安排的位置上。","But the creditors were reserved for a fate unexampled in the annals of commerce.When the events of this history bring them once more into notice, they will be found still in the position Grandet had resolved to force them into from the first."
"等公债一涨到一百一十五，葛朗台老头抛出了他的股权，收回了两百四十万法郎的黄金，他把这笔钱，连同从本金获取的六十万法郎复利，一起都放进了他的金库。德格拉桑现在生活在巴黎。首先，他当选为众议员；其次，他迷上了（尽管是一家之父，他却对索米尔的外省生活极为厌倦）夫人剧院一个漂亮的女演员，名叫弗洛丽娜，他现在又染上了当兵时的旧习气。他的行径不用多提，索米尔人认为那真是伤风败俗。他的妻子还算走运，争取到了她自己的财产，也有足够的能力继续维持索米尔的银行，银行在她的名下进行管理，并且补上了她丈夫挥霍所致的亏空。克吕绍派四处散播这个活寡妇处境艰难的流言蜚语，说她没把女儿嫁好，还说她被迫放弃了她儿子和欧仁妮·葛朗台联姻的所有希望。阿道夫跟他父亲一起呆在巴黎，据说，变成了一个窝囊废。克吕绍家胜利了。","As soon as the Funds reached a hundred and fifteen, Pere Grandet sold out his interests and withdrew two million four hundred thousand francs in gold, to which he added, in his coffers, the six hundred thousand francs compound interest which he had derived from the capital.Des Grassins now lived in Paris.In the first place he had been made a deputy; then he became infatuated (father of a family as he was, though horribly bored by the provincial life of Saumur) with a pretty actress at the Theatre de Madame, known as Florine, and he presently relapsed into the old habits of his army life.It is useless to speak of his conduct; Saumur considered it profoundly immoral.His wife was fortunate in the fact of her property being settled upon herself, and in having sufficient ability to keep up the banking-house in Saumur, which was managed in her name and repaired the breach in her fortune caused by the extravagance of her husband.The Cruchotines made so much talk about the false position of the quasi-widow that she married her daughter very badly, and was forced to give up all hope of an alliance between Eugenie Grandet and her son.Adolphe joined his father in Paris and became, it was said, a worthless fellow.The Cruchots triumphed."
"“您丈夫真糊涂，”当葛朗台借给德格拉桑太太一些钱，并让她在票据上签字时，他说，“我很同情您，因为您是个好妻子。”","“Your husband hasn’t common sense,” said Grandet as he lent Madame des Grassins some money on a note securely endorsed.“I am very sorry for you, for you are a good little woman.”"
"“啊，先生，”可怜的女人说，“谁能想到他离开索米尔去巴黎给您办差，竟会走上绝路呢？”","“Ah, monsieur,” said the poor lady, “who could have believed that when he left Saumur to go to Paris on your business he was going to his ruin?”"
"“老天作证，夫人，直到最后一刻，我都在拼命拦着他，不让他去呢。庭长先生非常想替代他，可是他打定主意要去，现在我们都知道是什么原因了。”","“Heaven is my witness, madame, that up to the last moment I did all I could to prevent him from going.Monsieur le president was most anxious to take his place; but he was determined to go, and now we all see why.”"
"这样一来，葛朗台就说得很清楚，他不欠德格拉桑的人情。在任何情况下，女人痛苦的理由总是比男人多，而且痛苦的程度也更深。男人有力气，而且有能力去施展力气；他活动，奔走，思考，忙碌；他展望未来，在未来里看到慰籍。夏尔就是这样。但是女人是呆在家里的，她总是面对悲伤而无以排遣。她深深陷于冲她张开大嘴的深渊中，测量它的深度，经常用眼泪和祈祷来填满它。这就是欧仁妮。她开始认识自己的命运。去感受，去爱，去受苦，去奉献自己——不就是女人生命的全部吗？欧仁妮各方面都可算作一个女人，只缺乏一个可资慰籍的东西。她的幸福像布满墙的钉子，拔起来——用波舒哀精彩的比喻来说——却永远无法填满她的手心。悲伤从不会姗姗来迟，对她来说，它们来得很快。夏尔走后第二天，葛朗台先生的家在大家眼里又恢复了原样，只有欧仁妮不这样看，对她来说，屋子突然一下子变空了。如果能瞒过她父亲的话，她希望夏尔的房间还可以保留他走时的样子。葛朗台太太和娜农很乐于帮她维持原状。","In this way Grandet made it quite plain that he was under no obligation to des Grassins.In all situations women have more cause for suffering than men, and they suffer more.Man has strength and the power of exercising it; he acts, moves, thinks, occupies himself; he looks ahead, and sees consolation in the future.It was thus with Charles.But the woman stays at home; she is always face to face with the grief from which nothing distracts her; she goes down to the depths of the abyss which yawns before her, measures it, and often fills it with her tears and prayers.Thus did Eugenie.She initiated herself into her destiny.To feel, to love, to suffer, to devote herself,—is not this the sum of woman’s life?Eugenie was to be in all things a woman, except in the one thing that consoles for all.Her happiness, picked up like nails scattered on a wall—to use the fine simile of Bossuet—would never so much as fill even the hollow of her hand.Sorrows are never long in coming; for her they came soon.The day after Charles’s departure the house of Monsieur Grandet resumed its ordinary aspect in the eyes of all, except in those of Eugenie, to whom it grew suddenly empty.She wished, if it could be done unknown to her father, that Charles’s room might be kept as he had left it.Madame Grandet and Nanon were willing accomplices in this @statu quo@."
"“谁知道他会不会比我们预想的要回来得早呢？”她说。","“Who knows but he may come back sooner than we think for?” she said."
"“啊，我真希望能看见他回来！”娜农回答道，“我喜欢他！他是这样一个可爱、讨人喜欢的年轻人——又漂亮，头发还卷卷的。”欧仁妮看着娜农。“圣母玛利亚！别那样看着我，小姐，你的眼睛像失了魂似的。”","“Ah, don’t I wish I could see him back!” answered Nanon.“I took to him!He was such a dear, sweet young man,—pretty too, with his curly hair.”Eugenie looked at Nanon.“Holy Virgin! Don’t look at me that way, mademoiselle; your eyes are like those of a lost soul.”"
"从那天起，葛朗台小姐的美有了新的特点。对爱情认真的思考慢慢填满了她的灵魂，再加上有了爱情的女人所具有的那种尊贵，她的眉目间平添了一种画家用光环来表现的光辉。在她堂弟到来之前，欧仁妮可以比作是没有受孕的圣女；在他走后，她就像圣母玛利亚——她孕育出了爱情。这两个截然不同的玛利亚，被西班牙艺术表现得栩栩如生，体现了基督教文化众多光辉的形象之一。","From that day the beauty of Mademoiselle Grandet took a new character.The solemn thoughts of love which slowly filled her soul, and the dignity of the woman beloved, gave to her features an illumination such as painters render by a halo.Before the coming of her cousin, Eugenie might be compared to the Virgin before the conception; after he had gone, she was like the Virgin Mother,—she had given birth to love.These two Marys so different, so well represented by Spanish art, embody one of those shining symbols with which Christianity abounds."
"夏尔走后第二天早上，欧仁妮听完弥撒回来——她发誓要天天听——她买了一张世界地图，钉到了她的镜子旁边，这样她就能跟着堂弟一路西去，就能让自己天天置身于他坐的船上，即使船很小也不怕，她就能看见他，问他上千个问题——“你好吗？","Returning from Mass on the morning after Charles’s departure,—having made a vow to hear it daily,—Eugenie bought a map of the world, which she nailed up beside her looking-glass, that she might follow her cousin on his westward way, that she might put herself, were it ever so little, day by day into the ship that bore him, and see him and ask him a thousand questions,—“Art thou well?"
"你受苦了吗？你曾教我知道了那颗星星的美丽和用途，当那颗星星在你头顶闪烁的时候，你想我了没有？”早上，她坐在胡桃树下那个虫蚀斑斑、覆盖着灰色苔藓的长凳上沉思，在这里他们曾经互诉衷肠、甜言蜜语，在这里他们曾经构想着他们未来家园的美丽城堡。此刻，当她抬头仰望着高高的围墙上留出的一角天空时，她遥想着将来；接着，她把目光转到阳光影影绰绰照到的一个角落，又转到夏尔卧室的屋顶。她的爱是孤独的爱，是持久的爱，渐渐浸入她的每一个思想，变成了生命的本质，或者像我们的先辈们曾说过的，变成了生命的组织。当那些自称是葛朗台老头的朋友晚上来打牌时，她做出高兴的样子，掩饰着自己；而整整一个早上，她都在跟她母亲和娜农谈着夏尔。娜农已经懂得，她可以对她小主人的痛苦表示同情，而并不有愧于她对老主人的职责，她对欧仁妮说——","Dost thou suffer?Dost thou think of me when the star, whose beauty and usefulness thou hast taught me to know, shines upon thee?”In the mornings she sat pensive beneath the walnut-tree, on the worm-eaten bench covered with gray lichens, where they had said to each other so many precious things, so many trifles, where they had built the pretty castles of their future home.She thought of the future now as she looked upward to the bit of sky which was all the high walls suffered her to see; then she turned her eyes to the angle where the sun crept on, and to the roof above the room in which he had slept.Hers was the solitary love, the persistent love, which glides into every thought and becomes the substance, or, as our fathers might have said, the tissue of life.When the would-be friends of Pere Grandet came in the evening for their game at cards, she was gay and dissimulating; but all the morning she talked of Charles with her mother and Nanon.Nanon had brought herself to see that she could pity the sufferings of her young mistress without failing in her duty to the old master, and she would say to Eugenie,—"
"“如果我有了自己的心上人，我会——我会跟着他到地狱，真的，我会为他去死的，可是我没有心上人。我到死也永远不会知道人生是怎么回事。你相信吗，小姐，那个老科努瓦耶（倒是个好人）总是围着我的裙子转，他是为了我的钱——就像全世界那些来嗅着主人的奶酪、向你献殷勤的耗子？我什么都明白，我的眼光敏锐，尽管我高得像塔顶。唉，小姐，这挺让我高兴，但那不是爱情。”","“If I had a man for myself I’d—I’d follow him to hell, yes, I’d exterminate myself for him; but I’ve none.I shall die and never know what life is.Would you believe, mamz’elle, that old Cornoiller (a good fellow all the same) is always round my petticoats for the sake of my money,—just for all the world like the rats who come smelling after the master’s cheese and paying court to you?I see it all; I’ve got a shrewd eye, though I am as big as a steeple.Well, mamz’elle, it pleases me, but it isn’t love.”"
"第十章","Chapter X "
"两个月过去了。这家人的生活曾经那么单调，现在因为这些女人都密切关心着一个秘密而有了生气，这个秘密把她们紧紧地连在了一起。对她们来说，夏尔还在大厅那阴森的灰色椽木下生活着，并走来走去。一早一晚，欧仁妮都会打开梳妆箱，凝视她婶婶的肖像。一个星期天的早晨，正当她全神贯注地在婶婶的脸上揣摩堂弟本人的面貌时，被母亲撞见了。葛朗台太太这时才第一次知道了那个可怕的秘密，夏尔换取了她女儿的宝物。","Two months went by.This domestic life, once so monotonous, was now quickened with the intense interest of a secret that bound these women intimately together.For them Charles lived and moved beneath the grim gray rafters of the hall.Night and morning Eugenie opened the dressing-case and gazed at the portrait of her aunt.One Sunday morning her mother surprised her as she stood absorbed in finding her cousin’s features in his mother’s face.Madame Grandet was then for the first time admitted into the terrible secret of the exchange made by Charles against her daughter’s treasure."
"“你全都给了他！”可怜的母亲吓坏了，大声说道，“等新年你父亲要看你的金子时，你可怎么跟他说？”","“You gave him all!” cried the poor mother, terrified.“What will you say to your father on New Year’s Day when he asks to see your gold?”"
"欧仁妮两眼发了直，两个女人大半个早上都惶恐得要命。她们脑子里乱糟糟的，以致于错过了大弥撒，只听到了结尾的弥撒曲。再有三天，一八一九年就要过完了。三天后，一场可怕的戏剧就要开演了，这是一个资产阶级的悲剧，没有毒药，没有匕首，也没有鲜血四溅；可是——对于剧中的所有演员来说——却要比神话中阿特里得斯家族所发生的一切惨剧还要残酷。","Eugenie’s eyes grew fixed, and the two women lived through mortal terror for more than half the morning.They were so troubled in mind that they missed high Mass, and only went to the military service.In three days the year 1819 would come to an end.In three days a terrible drama would begin, a bourgeois tragedy, without poison, or dagger, or the spilling of blood; but—as regards the actors in it—more cruel than all the fabled horrors in the family of the Atrides."
"“我们怎么办？”葛朗台太太把毛线活放在膝盖上，对女儿说道。","“What will become of us?” said Madame Grandet to her daughter, letting her knitting fall upon her knees."
"这可怜的母亲在过去的两个月中经历了这么多的焦虑，竟连过冬要用的毛线袖套都还没织好。这件家务事尽管表面上无关紧要，却产生了可悲的后果。由于没有那副袖套，她丈夫大发雷霆时，她出了身冷汗，结果竟中了恶寒。","The poor mother had gone through such anxiety for the past two months that the woollen sleeves which she needed for the coming winter were not yet finished.This domestic fact, insignificant as it seems, bore sad results.For want of those sleeves, a chill seized her in the midst of a sweat caused by a terrible explosion of anger on the part of her husband."
"“我可怜的孩子，我一直在想，如果你早跟我透露你的秘密，我们应该还有时间写信给在巴黎的德格拉桑先生。他或许能给我们寄一些和你的金子相仿的金币,尽管葛朗台很熟悉它们，也许——”","“I have been thinking, my poor child, that if you had confided your secret to me we should have had time to write to Monsieur des Grassins in Paris.He might have sent us gold pieces like yours; though Grandet knows them all, perhaps—” "
"“我们到哪里去弄到钱呢？”","“Where could we have got the money?”"
"“我会把我自己的财产抵押出去。此外，德格拉桑先生会——”","“I would have pledged my own property.Besides, Monsieur des Grassins would have—” "
"“太晚了，”欧仁妮声音嘶哑空洞地说道，“明天早晨我们得去他的卧室给他拜年。”","“It is too late,” said Eugenie in a broken, hollow voice.“Tomorrow morning we must go and wish him a happy New Year in his chamber.”"
"“可是，我的女儿，为什么我不能去问问克吕绍呢？”","“But, my daughter, why should I not consult the Cruchots?”"
"“不，不，那是把我送到他们那里去，由着他们摆布我们了。而且，我已经拿定主意了。我做得对，我没什么可后悔的。上帝会保佑我的。愿他保佑我！啊！母亲，如果您看过他的信，您也会一心只想着他的。”","“No, no; it would be delivering me up to them, and putting ourselves in their power.Besides, I have chosen my course.I have done right; I repent of nothing.God will protect me.His will be done!Ah! mother, if you had read his letter, you, too, would have thought only of him.”"
"第二天早上，也就是一八二零年一月一日，母女俩在极度的恐惧下，想出了一个很自然的借口，可以不用郑重其事地到葛朗台的卧室了。一八一九至一八二零年的冬天是那个时代最寒冷的一个冬天。屋顶堆满了积雪。","The next morning, January 1, 1820, the horrible fear to which mother and daughter were a prey suggested to their minds a natural excuse by which to escape the solemn entrance into Grandet’s chamber.The winter of 1819-1820 was one of the coldest of that epoch.The snow encumbered the roofs."
"葛朗台太太一听到她丈夫的房间有响动，就叫了叫他，并说道——　","Madame Grandet called to her husband as soon as she heard him stirring in his chamber, and said,—"
"“葛朗台，你叫娜农在我这里生个火吧？太冷了，我在被窝里都冻僵了。到我这个年纪，我就需要舒适的环境了。而且，”稍停了一下，她又说道，“欧仁妮要来穿衣服，这种天气，可怜的孩子在她冰冷的屋子里穿衣会得病的。之后我们会去大厅的壁炉边给你拜年的。”","“Grandet, will you let Nanon light a fire here for me?The cold is so sharp that I am freezing under the bedclothes.At my age I need some comforts.Besides,” she added, after a slight pause, “Eugenie shall come and dress here; the poor child might get an illness from dressing in her cold room in such weather.Then we will go and wish you a happy New Year beside the fire in the hall.”"
"“得，得，得，得，真会说！新年的好开头，葛朗台太太！你以前从没说过这么多的话，我想，你该不是把面包浸到酒里了吧。”","“Ta, ta, ta, ta, what a tongue! A pretty way to begin the new year, Madame Grandet!You never talked so much before; but you haven’t been sopping your bread in wine, I know that.”"
"一时都沉默了。","There was a moment’s silence."
"“好吧，”老头同意了妻子的要求，毫无疑问，他自有道理，他继续说道，“我会按你的意思做的，葛朗台太太。你是个好女人，我不想让你在这把年纪还有什么闪失——尽管一般而言，贝尔特利耶家的人身体都很棒。嗯！是不是这样？”他停了一下，又说道，“算了，咱们最后拿了他们的遗产，我原谅他们。”说完，他咳嗽了起来。","“Well,” resumed the goodman, who no doubt had some reason of his own for agreeing to his wife’s request, “I’ll do what you ask, Madame Grandet.You are a good woman, and I don’t want any harm to happen to you at your time of life,—though as a general thing the Bertellieres are as sound as a roach.Hein! Isn’t that so?” he added after a pause.“Well, I forgive them; we got their property in the end.”And he coughed."
"“你今天早上很开心，先生。”可怜的女人口气严肃地说道。","“You are very gay this morning, monsieur,” said the poor woman gravely."
"“我一直很开心——","“I’m always gay,—"
"‘开心，开心，开心，箍桶匠，","‘Gai, gai, gai, le tonnelier,"
"快补你的洗衣桶！’”他一边答着，一边衣着齐整地进了妻子的房间。“是的，说实话，真是够冷的，能把你冻僵。咱们今天早餐吃好的，太太。德格拉桑给我送来了蘑菇鹅肝酱！我现在就到驿站取去。包裹里还会有给欧仁妮的一枚面值四十法郎的金币，”他在葛朗台太太的耳边低声说道，“我没金子了，太太。我本来有几个零碎钱——我不怕告诉你——可是我必须要用到生意上。”","Raccommodez votre cuvier!’” he answered, entering his wife’s room fully dressed.“Yes, on my word, it is cold enough to freeze you solid.We shall have a fine breakfast, wife.Des Grassins has sent me a pate-de-foie-gras truffled!I am going now to get it at the coach-office.There’ll be a double napoleon for Eugenie in the package,” he whispered in Madame Grandet’s ear.“I have no gold left, wife.I had a few stray pieces—I don’t mind telling you that—but I had to let them go in business.”"
"接着，为祝贺新年，他吻了吻她的额头。","Then, by way of celebrating the new year, he kissed her on the forehead."
"“欧仁妮，”等葛朗台的身影完全消失后，母亲大声叫着，“我不知道你父亲是从床的哪边起的身，他今天早上脾气非常好。也许我们最后会平安无事呢？”","“Eugenie,” cried the mother, when Grandet was fairly gone, “I don’t know which side of the bed your father got out of, but he is good-tempered this morning.Perhaps we shall come out safe after all?”"
"“老爷怎么啦？”娜农说着，进了女主人的房间来生火，“首先，他说，‘早上好，新年快乐，你个大笨蛋！去给我太太生火去，她冷’；接着，当他伸出手给了我一枚一点儿没磨损过的六法郎的硬币时，我能不发傻吗？看看这个，太太！哦，好心人！他是个好人，那是事实。有些人是越老心肠越硬，可是他——他为什么就会越变越温和，越来越好，就像您的果味甜酒一样呢！他是个非常非常好的人——”","“What’s happened to the master?” said Nanon, entering her mistress’s room to light the fire.“First place, he said, ‘Good-morning; happy New Year, you big fool!Go and light my wife’s fire, she’s cold’; and then, didn’t I feel silly when he held out his hand and gave me a six-franc piece, which isn’t worn one bit?Just look at it, madame!Oh, the kind man!He is a good man, that’s a fact.There are some people who the older they get the harder they grow; but he,—why he’s getting soft and improving with time, like your ratafia!He is a good, good man—” "
"葛朗台高兴的秘密在于他的投机生意大获成功。德格拉桑先生在扣除了老箍桶匠欠他的十五万法郎荷兰债券的贴现折扣，以及为他买进每年十万法郎的公债垫付的盈余之后，现在通过驿车给他送来了他头半年的利息余额，三万法郎的银币，同时通知他公债已经开始升值。","The secret of Grandet’s joy lay in the complete success of his speculation.Monsieur des Grassins, after deducting the amount which the old cooper owed him for the discount on a hundred and fifty thousand francs in Dutch notes, and for the surplus which he had advanced to make up the sum required for the investment in the Funds which was to produce a hundred thousand francs a year, had now sent him, by the diligence, thirty thousand francs in silver coin, the remainder of his first half-year’s interest, informing him at the same time that the Funds had already gone up in value."
"那时公债报价是八十九，到一月底，最精明的资本家们还是以九十三买进的。这样，葛朗台的投资在两个月内赚了百分之十二；他已经核算过账目，将来每六个月能获得五万法郎的利息，无须缴纳税费或者维修费。他终于明白了投资公债的好处——外省人对这个体系一向深恶痛绝——不出五年，不用他费多少力，资本就会增长，他就会成为六百万资本的主人，这些钱，再加上他的地产价值和收益，会让他拥有一笔绝对巨大无比的财富。","They were then quoted at eighty-nine; the shrewdest capitalists bought in, towards the last of January, at ninety-three.Grandet had thus gained in two months twelve per cent on his capital; he had simplified his accounts, and would in future receive fifty thousand francs interest every six months, without incurring any taxes or costs for repairs.He understood at last what it was to invest money in the public securities,—a system for which provincials have always shown a marked repugnance,—and at the end of five years he found himself master of a capital of six millions, which increased without much effort of his own, and which, joined to the value and proceeds of his territorial possessions, gave him a fortune that was absolutely colossal."
"也许是对这个可怜的佣人不自觉帮了主人某个大忙，她的主人才给了她六法郎作为奖赏吧。","The six francs bestowed on Nanon were perhaps the reward of some great service which the poor servant had rendered to her master unawares."
"“哦！哦！葛朗台老头要去哪里呀？从太阳升起来，他就一直到处乱转，好像去救火似的。”生意人们当天一边开着铺门，一边互相谈论着。","“Oh! Oh! Where’s Pere Grandet going?He has been scurrying about since sunrise as if to a fire,” said the tradespeople to each other as they opened their shops for the day."
"当看见他从码头回来，后面跟着一个驿站的脚夫，脚夫推着一辆装满袋子的独轮车时，他们各抒己见——","When they saw him coming back from the wharf, followed by a porter from the coach-office wheeling a barrow which was laden with sacks, they all had their comments to make:—"
"“水往河里流，老家伙在追着金子跑。”一个人说。","“Water flows to the river; the old fellow was running after his gold,” said one."
"“他从巴黎、弗罗瓦丰，还有荷兰往回捞钱呢。”另一个人说。","“He gets it from Paris and Froidfond and Holland,” said another."
"“他最后会把索米尔都买下来呢。”第三个人大声说道。","“He’ll end by buying up Saumur,” cried a third."
"“他不怕冷，他忙着赚钱呢。”一位妻子对她的丈夫说道。","“He doesn’t mind the cold, he’s so wrapped up in his gains,” said a wife to her husband."
"“嘿！嘿！葛朗台先生，如果您拿着太重，”他最近的邻居——一个卖布的商人说道，“我替您拿着。”","“Hey! Hey!Monsieur Grandet, if that’s too heavy for you,” said a cloth-dealer, his nearest neighbor, “I’ll take it off your hands.”"
"“重？”箍桶匠说，“我倒想这样，都是铜钱而已！”","“Heavy?” said the cooper, “I should think so; it’s all sous!”"
"“银子的苏。”脚夫低声说道。","“Silver sous,” said the porter in a low voice."
"“要是想让我关照你，就闭上你的嘴。”等他们到了门口，老头对脚夫说。","“If you want me to take care of you, keep your tongue between your teeth,” said the goodman to the porter as they reached the door."
"“老狐狸！我以为他耳朵聋呢，看来在冷天里他倒是听得清。”","“The old fox!I thought he was deaf; seems he can hear fast enough in frosty weather.”"
"“这是给你过年的二十个苏，别乱讲！”葛朗台说，“滚蛋！娜农会把你的独轮车还回去的。娜农，母女俩都去教堂了？”","“Here’s twenty sous for your New Year, and @mum@!” said Grandet.“Be off with you!Nanon shall take back your barrow.Nanon, are the linnets at church?”"
"“是的，先生。”","“Yes, monsieur.”"
"“那搭把手！去干活！”他嚷嚷着，把袋子堆到她身上。不一会儿，东西都搬进了他的内屋，他进去关上了门。“等早饭好了，敲敲墙。”他进去的时候说道，“把独轮车还回驿站去。”","“Then lend a hand! Go to work!” he cried, piling the sacks upon her.In a few moments all were carried up to his inner room, where he shut himself in with them.“When breakfast is ready, knock on the wall,” he said as he disappeared.“Take the barrow back to the coach-office.”"
"一家人那天直到十点才吃早饭。","The family did not breakfast that day until ten o’clock."
"“你父亲不会在楼下问你要金子看的，”当她们望完弥撒回来时，葛朗台太太说道，“你一定要假装很冷。在你生日前，我们可能还有时间来把那笔钱补上。”","“Your father will not ask to see your gold downstairs,” said Madame Grandet as they got back from Mass.“You must pretend to be very chilly.We may have time to replace the treasure before your fete-day.”"
"葛朗台一边下楼，一边想着他那笔成功的政府公债投机生意，考虑怎么样才能把他在巴黎赚的银子变成纯金；他决定以这种方法把所有收入投资进去，直到行情涨到一百法郎为止。对欧仁妮来说，这真是致命的盘算！他一进来，两个女人就给他拜年——他的女儿搂着他的脖子，抚摸着他；葛朗台太太则是很严肃、很庄重的样子。","Grandet came down the staircase thinking of his splendid speculation in government securities, and wondering how he could metamorphose his Parisian silver into solid gold; he was making up his mind to invest in this way everything he could lay hands on until the Funds should reach a par value.Fatal reverie for Eugenie!As soon as he came in, the two women wished him a happy New Year,—his daughter by putting her arms round his neck and caressing him; Madame Grandet gravely and with dignity."
"“哈！哈！我的孩子，”他吻了吻女儿的两颊，说道，“我是为你操劳的，瞧见没？我是为你的幸福着想的。要幸福，就得有钱。没有钱，不会有一丁点儿幸福的。喏！给你一个新拿破仑币。我让人从巴黎捎的。我以名誉担保，我所有的金子就是这个了，你是家里唯一有金子的人。我要看看你的金子，小乖乖。”","“Ha! Ha! My child,” he said, kissing his daughter on both cheeks.“I work for you, don’t you see?I think of your happiness.Must have money to be happy.Without money there’s not a particle of happiness.Here! There’s a new napoleon for you.I sent to Paris for it.On my word of honor, it’s all the gold I have; you are the only one that has got any gold.I want to see your gold, little one.”"
"“哦！太冷了，咱们吃早饭吧。”欧仁妮回答道。","“Oh! It is too cold; let us have breakfast,” answered Eugenie."
"“好的，那就等早饭后再说，有助于消化。德格拉桑那个胖子送了我肉酱。想吃多少，就吃多少，我的孩子们，又不花一分钱。德格拉桑干得不错。我对他很满意。这老家伙在帮夏尔的大忙，而且还是免费。他把那个可怜的、已故的葛朗台的事处理得很妥当。呜！呜！”他嘴里塞得满满的，停了一下，嘟哝着，“太好吃了！吃点吧，太太，这东西至少让你饱上两天。”","“Well, after breakfast, then; it will help the digestion.That fat des Grassins sent me the pate.Eat as much as you like, my children, it costs nothing.Des Grassins is getting along very well.I am satisfied with him.The old fish is doing Charles a good service, and gratis too.He is making a very good settlement of that poor deceased Grandet’s business.Hoo! Hoo!” he muttered, with his mouth full, after a pause, “how good it is!Eat some, wife; that will feed you for at least two days.”"
"“我不饿。我身体很不舒服，你知道的。”","“I am not hungry.I am very poorly; you know that.”"
"“啊，呸！你尽可以吃得饱饱的，撑不死，你是贝尔特利耶家的人，他们身子骨都很结实。你皮肤是有点黄，的确如此，不过我本人喜欢黄色。”","“Ah, bah! You can stuff yourself as full as you please without danger, you’re a Bertelliere; they are all hearty.You are a bit yellow, that’s true; but I like yellow, myself.”"
"一个等着蒙受耻辱、当众处死的死囚也许都不会比等着早饭后出事的葛朗台太太和欧仁妮更为惊恐。老头边讲边吃，他越高兴，她们的心就揪得越厉害。不过，女儿在这场危机面前有个内在的支柱——她从爱情中汲取了力量。","The expectation of ignominious and public death is perhaps less horrible to a condemned criminal than the anticipation of what was coming after breakfast to Madame Grandet and Eugenie.The more gleefully the old man talked and ate, the more their hearts shrank within them.The daughter, however, had an inward prop at this crisis,—she gathered strength through love."
"“为了他！为了他！”她在心里呐喊着，“我愿意死上一千次。”","“For him! For him!” she cried within her, “I would die a thousand deaths.”"
"这样想着，她朝母亲望去，眼里闪烁着勇敢无畏的神采。","At this thought, she shot a glance at her mother which flamed with courage."
"“收拾走，”大约十一点，早饭吃完后，葛朗台对娜农说道，“不过，把桌子留下。我们可以把你的小金库摆在上面，”他一边说，一边看着欧仁妮，“小？千真万确！不，它不小。你拥有的实际价值是五千九百五十九法郎，还有我刚刚给你的四十法郎。差一个，就是六千法郎。好的，现在看看这儿，小乖乖！我要给你一个法郎，好凑个整数。嘿！你听什么呢，娜农？少管闲事，干你自己的活去。”","“Clear away,” said Grandet to Nanon when, about eleven o’clock, breakfast was over, “but leave the table.We can spread your little treasure upon it,” he said, looking at Eugenie.“Little?Faith! No; it isn’t little.You possess, in actual value, five thousand nine hundred and fifty-nine francs and the forty I gave you just now.That makes six thousand francs, less one.Well, now see here, little one!I’ll give you that one franc to make up the round number.Hey! What are you listening for, Nanon?Mind your own business; go and do your work.”"
"娜农走了。","Nanon disappeared."
"“现在听着，欧仁妮，你必须把你的金子还给我。你不会拒绝你父亲的，我的小姑娘，嗯？”","“Now listen, Eugenie; you must give me back your gold.You won’t refuse your father, my little girl, hein?”"
"两个女人都不说话。","The two women were dumb."
"“我没金子。我曾经有一些，不过都没了。我会还给你六千法郎里弗赫的，而且你要按我说的把这笔钱放出去。你千万别再想着你的什么‘压箱钱’了。等我把你嫁出去的时候（那会很快的），我会给你找个丈夫，他能给你外省所见过的最体面的‘压箱钱’的。现在听我的，小姑娘。有个好机会等着你，你可以把你那六千法郎投进政府公债里，然后你每六个月就会得到差不多两百法郎的利息，没有税费，没有维修费，也没有什么霜呀、冰雹呀、洪水呀，没有任何东西会把钱给吞噬掉。也许你不想和你的金子分开，嘿，我的小姑娘？别担心，只管拿给我。像那样的金子，我会给你更多——比如荷兰硬币和葡萄牙币、莫卧儿卢比、热那亚金币——在你生日那天，我会再多给你一些的，三年以后，你就会拿回一半你的小金库。你看那怎么样？现在把头抬起来。来吧，去把它拿来，那些宝贵的金属。你应该吻吻我的眼睑，因为我告诉了你金钱生死的诀窍和奥秘。是的，银子和金子像人一样有生命，会成群地活动，它们来了，又去了，会出汗，能繁殖——”","“I have no gold myself.I had some, but it is all gone.I’ll give you in return six thousand francs in @livres@, and you are to put them just where I tell you.You mustn’t think anything more about your ‘dozen.’ When I marry you (which will be soon) I shall get you a husband who can give you the finest ‘dozen’ ever seen in the provinces.Now attend to me, little girl.There’s a fine chance for you; you can put your six thousand francs into government funds, and you will receive every six months nearly two hundred francs interest, without taxes, or repairs, or frost, or hail, or floods, or anything else to swallow up the money.Perhaps you don’t like to part with your gold, hey, my girl?Never mind, bring it to me all the same.I’ll get you some more like it,—like those Dutch coins and the @portugaises@, the rupees of Mogul, and the @genovines@,—I’ll give you some more on your fete-days, and in three years you’ll have got back half your little treasure.What’s that you say?Look up, now.Come, go and get it, the precious metal.You ought to kiss me on the eyelids for telling you the secrets and the mysteries of the life and death of money.Yes, silver and gold live and swarm like men; they come, and go, and sweat, and multiply—” "
"欧仁妮站了起来，但是朝门口走了几步之后，她突然转过身来，当面直视着父亲，说道——","Eugenie rose; but after making a few steps towards the door she turned abruptly, looked her father in the face, and said,—"
"“我的金子没了。”","“I have not got @my@ gold.”"
"“你的金子没了！”葛朗台一边高声叫着，一边像一匹听到旁边有大炮在发射的马一样，直挺挺地站了起来。","“You have not got your gold!” cried Grandet, starting up erect, like a horse that hears a cannon fired beside him."
"“是的，我没金子了。”","“No, I have not got it.”"
"“你搞错了吧，欧仁妮。”","“You are mistaken, Eugenie.”"
"“没有。”","“No.”"
"“凭我老父的剪刀作证！”","“By the shears of my father!”"
"每当老头骂出这句咒语时，房梁都会颤起来。","Whenever the old man swore that oath the rafters trembled."
"“圣母玛利亚！太太的脸都白了。”娜农叫道。","“Holy Virgin!Madame is turning pale,” cried Nanon."
"“葛朗台，你的火气会吓死我的。”可怜的母亲说道。","“Grandet, your anger will kill me,” said the poor mother."
"“得，得，得，得！胡说八道，你永远都不会死在家里！欧仁妮，你拿你的金子干什么去了？”他向她冲过来，喊道。","“Ta, ta, ta, ta! Nonsense; you never die in your family!Eugenie, what have you done with your gold?” he cried, rushing upon her."
"“先生，”女儿趴在葛朗台太太的膝上，说道，“我母亲病了。看看她，别逼死她。”","“Monsieur,” said the daughter, falling at Madame Grandet’s knees, “my mother is ill.Look at her; do not kill her.”"
"看到妻子平时泛黄的脸色发了白，葛朗台害怕了。","Grandet was frightened by the pallor which overspread his wife’s face, usually so yellow."
"“娜农，把我扶上床，”可怜的女人声音微弱地说道，“我要死了——”","“Nanon, help me to bed,” said the poor woman in a feeble voice, “I am dying—” "
"娜农扶住她的女主人一只胳膊，欧仁妮扶住了她的另一只；但是她们费尽力气才把她扶上楼，她每走一步都精疲力尽地要跌倒。葛朗台独自呆着。可是不一会儿，他走上六级或是八级楼梯，大声喊着——","Nanon gave her mistress an arm, Eugenie gave her another; but it was only with infinite difficulty that they could get her upstairs, she fell with exhaustion at every step.Grandet remained alone.However, in a few moments he went up six or eight stairs and called out,—"
"“欧仁妮，等你母亲躺到了床上，你就下来。”","“Eugenie, when your mother is in bed, come down.”"
"“是，父亲。”","“Yes, father.”"
"安抚了母亲之后，她很快就来了。","She soon came, after reassuring her mother."
"“女儿，”葛朗台说，“现在，你要告诉我，你用金子做什么了。”","“My daughter,” said Grandet, “you will now tell me what you have done with your gold.”"
"“父亲，如果你送了我礼物，我却不是唯一的主人，那就把它们拿回去。”她一边冷冷地回答道，一边从壁炉台上拿起那个拿破仑币，递给了他。","“My father, if you make me presents of which I am not the sole mistress, take them back,” she answered coldly, picking up the napoleon from the chimney-piece and offering it to him."
"葛朗台抓住那枚硬币，塞进他的裤子兜里。","Grandet seized the coin and slipped it into his breeches’ pocket."
"“我肯定再也不给你任何东西了。连那个也不给！”他把大拇指的指甲往一颗前门牙上一磕，说道，“你竟敢蔑视你的父亲？你不信任他？你难道不知道什么叫做父亲吗？要是他对你来说什么都不是，他就什么都不是。你的金子到哪里去了？”","“I shall certainly never give you anything again.Not so much as that!” he said, clicking his thumb-nail against a front tooth.“Do you dare to despise your father? Have you no confidence in him?Don’t you know what a father is?If he is nothing for you, he is nothing at all.Where is your gold?”"
"“父亲，尽管您生了气，我还是爱您，尊重您的，可是我要斗胆提醒您，我已经二十三岁了。您经常告诉我，我已经成年了，我没有忘记这句话。我已经按照我自己的意愿用了我的钱，您尽可以放心，钱用在正经地方了——”","“Father, I love and respect you, in spite of your anger; but I humbly ask you to remember that I am twenty-three years old.You have told me often that I have attained my majority, and I do not forget it.I have used my money as I chose to use it, and you may be sure that it was put to a good use—” "
"“干什么用了？”","“What use?”"
"“那是个秘密，不能泄露，”她回答道，“您就没有秘密吗？”","“That is an inviolable secret,” she answered.“Have you no secrets?”"
"“我是一家之长，我有自己的事。”","“I am the head of the family; I have my own affairs.”"
"“那这就是我的事。”","“And this is mine.”"
"“要是连你父亲也不能告诉，那就不是什么好事，葛朗台小姐。”","“It must be something bad if you can’t tell it to your father, Mademoiselle Grandet.”"
"“是好事，不过我不能告诉父亲。”","“It is good, and I cannot tell it to my father.”"
"“至少你可以告诉我，你是什么时候没有金子的？”","“At least you can tell me when you parted with your gold?”"
"欧仁妮摇摇头，表示拒绝。","Eugenie made a negative motion with her head."
"“你过生日的时候，金子还在你手里，嗯？”","“You had it on your birthday, hein?”"
"她因为爱情而变得很狡猾，就像她父亲因为贪婪而狡猾一样，她一再摇头拒绝。","She grew as crafty through love as her father was through avarice, and reiterated the negative sign."
"“竟然这么顽固！那就是偷盗。”葛朗台大叫着，他的声音越来越大，渐渐地在整幢房子里都回响起来，“什么！在这儿，在我自己的家里，在我的眼皮子底下，有人拿走了你的金子！——我们仅有的金子！——而我还不能知道是谁拿的！金子是珍贵的东西。老实姑娘有时也会犯错，会给——我不知道是什么；在大户人家，甚至在平民百姓家，她们都会做这种事。可是竟然把她们的金子送人！——因为你已经给了什么人，嗯？——”","“Was there ever such obstinacy!It’s a theft,” cried Grandet, his voice going up in a crescendo which gradually echoed through the house.“What! Here, in my own home, under my very eyes, somebody has taken your gold!—The only gold we have!—And I’m not to know who has got it!Gold is a precious thing.Virtuous girls go wrong sometimes, and give—I don’t know what; they do it among the great people, and even among the bourgeoisie.But give their gold!—For you have given it to someone, hein?—” "
"欧仁妮沉默着，不动声色。","Eugenie was silent and impassive."
"“竟然会有这么一个女儿？我到底还是不是你的父亲？如果你把金子投资到什么地方，你应该有个收据——”","“Was there ever such a daughter?Is it possible that I am your father?If you have invested it anywhere, you must have a receipt—” "
"“我有没有自由——有还是没有——用我的钱去做我想做的事？那钱难道不是我的吗？”","“Was I free—yes or no—to do what I would with my own?Was it not mine?”"
"“你还是个孩子。”","“You are a child.”"
"“成年了。”","“Of age.”"
"被女儿的逻辑驳得哑口无言，葛朗台脸色发白，跺着脚咒骂起来。等他最终要说话时，他大声嚷道：","Dumbfounded by his daughter’s logic, Grandet turned pale and stamped and swore.When at last he found words, he cried:"
"“毒蛇！该死的丫头！啊，骗子！你知道我是疼爱你的，你就利用这一点。她是要割断她父亲的喉咙！老天爷！你把我们的家产给了那个游手好闲的家伙——那个穿摩洛哥羊皮靴的花花公子！　凭我老父的剪刀作证！我不能剥夺你的继承权，可是我要诅咒你——你和你的堂弟，还有你们的孩子！那不会有好结果的！你听见了吗？要是钱给了夏尔——不过，不，那不可能。什么！是那个恶棍抢劫了我吗？——”"," “Serpent!Cursed girl!Ah, deceitful creature!You know I love you, and you take advantage of it.She’d cut her father’s throat!Good God! You’ve given our fortune to that ne’er-do-well,—that dandy with morocco boots!By the shears of my father!I can’t disinherit you, but I curse you,—you and your cousin and your children!Nothing good will come of it!Do you hear?If it was to Charles—but, no; it’s impossible.What! Has that wretched fellow robbed me?—” "
"他看着他的女儿，她仍旧神情冷漠，一声不吭。","He looked at his daughter, who continued cold and silent."
"“她动也不动；她不会退缩！她比我这个葛朗台还葛朗台！哈！你不会是白白把金子给出去的吧？喂，说真话！”","“She won’t stir; she won’t flinch!She’s more Grandet than I’m Grandet!Ha! You have not given your gold for nothing?Come, speak the truth!”"
"欧仁妮带着挖苦的神气看着她的父亲，这惹恼了他。","Eugenie looked at her father with a sarcastic expression that stung him."
"“欧仁妮，你是在这里，在我的家里——在你父亲的家里。如果你想呆在这儿，你就必须听我的话。神父告诫你要服从我。”欧仁妮低下了头。“你在我最心疼的事情上伤了我的心。你要是不屈服，我就不想再看见你。去你的卧室去。没有我的许可，你就别出来。娜农会给你送面包和水的。你听见我的话没有——走！”","“Eugenie, you are here, in my house,—in your father’s house.If you wish to stay here, you must submit yourself to me.The priests tell you to obey me.”Eugenie bowed her head.“You affront me in all I hold most dear.I will not see you again until you submit.Go to your chamber.You will stay there till I give you permission to leave it.Nanon will bring you bread and water.You hear me—go!”"
"欧仁妮嚎啕大哭起来，急忙跑到她母亲那里。葛朗台在雪地里绕着花园转了两三圈，也不觉得冷。突然，他疑心女儿跑到了她母亲那里；很高兴能揪住她违抗自己的命令，他便像只猫一样敏捷地爬上楼梯，到了葛朗台太太的屋子里。这时欧仁妮正把脸埋在她母亲的怀里，而葛朗台太太在抚摸着女儿的头发。","Eugenie burst into tears and fled up to her mother.Grandet, after marching two or three times round the garden in the snow without heeding the cold, suddenly suspected that his daughter had gone to her mother; only too happy to find her disobedient to his orders, he climbed the stairs with the agility of a cat and appeared in Madame Grandet’s room just as she was stroking Eugenie’s hair, while the girl’s face was hidden in her motherly bosom."
"“别伤心，我可怜的孩子，”她正说道，“你父亲会消气的。”","“Be comforted, my poor child,” she was saying, “your father will get over it.”"
"“她没有父亲！”老头说，“葛朗台太太，难道你和我能生出个这么不听话的孩子吗？教育得真好——还信教呢！哎！你为什么不呆在你的卧室里？来吧，去牢房，去牢房，小姐！”","“She has no father!” said the old man.“Can it be you and I, Madame Grandet, who have given birth to such a disobedient child?A fine education,—religious, too!Well! Why are you not in your chamber?Come, to prison, to prison, mademoiselle!”"
"“你要把我女儿从我身边夺走吗？”葛朗台太太说着，转头看着他，一张脸此时烧得通红。","“Would you deprive me of my daughter, monsieur?” said Madame Grandet, turning towards him a face that was now red with fever."
"“要是你想留她，把她带走！滚——滚出我的家，你们两个！遭雷劈的！金子在哪儿？金子怎么啦？”","“If you want to keep her, carry her off!Clear out—out of my house, both of you!Thunder! Where is the gold? What’s become of the gold?”"
"欧仁妮站起来，高傲地看了看她的父亲，回了自己的房间。葛朗台用钥匙锁上了门。","Eugenie rose, looked proudly at her father, and withdrew to her room.Grandet turned the key of the door."
"“娜农，”他大声喊道，“把大厅的火灭了。”","“Nanon,” he cried, “put out the fire in the hall.”"
"接着，他坐到妻子屋里壁炉边的扶手椅上，对她说——","Then he sat down in an armchair beside his wife’s fire and said to her,—"
"“毫无疑问，她把金子给了那个勾引她的卑鄙家伙——夏尔，他一心就想着咱们的钱。”","“Undoubtedly she has given the gold to that miserable seducer, Charles, who only wanted our money.”"
"“我对这件事一无所知，”她朝床的另一边翻过身，躲开丈夫凶狠的目光，回答道，“我对你的残暴受得够多了，如果我相信自己的预感，我可能再也不会离开这间屋子了，除非被棺材抬出去。你应该饶过我，不要让我遭这个罪，先生——我可从来没有让你难受过，是的，我想是这样。你的女儿是爱你的。我相信她和胎儿一样清白。别难为她。收回你的成命。天冷得厉害，你会害她生大病的。”","“I knew nothing about it,” she answered, turning to the other side of the bed, that she might escape the savage glances of her husband.“I suffer so much from your violence that I shall never leave this room, if I trust my own presentiments, till I am carried out of it in my coffin.You ought to have spared me this suffering, monsieur,—you, to whom I have caused no pain; that is, I think so.Your daughter loves you.I believe her to be as innocent as the babe unborn.Do not make her wretched.Revoke your sentence.The cold is very severe; you may give her some serious illness.”"
"“我不会见她，也不会跟她说话。她得呆在她的屋子里，吃面包，喝水，直到她向她父亲屈服为止。见鬼！一个父亲难道不该知道家里的金子去了哪儿吗？她拥有的卢比是法国仅有的几个，也许，还有荷兰达克特和热那亚金币——”","“I will not see her, neither will I speak to her.She shall stay in her room, on bread and water, until she submits to her father.What the devil! Shouldn’t a father know where the gold in his house has gone to?She owned the only rupees in France, perhaps, and the Dutch ducats and the @genovines@—” "
"“先生，欧仁妮是我们独生女，即使她把金币都扔进了水里——”","“Monsieur, Eugenie is our only child; and even if she had thrown them into the water—” "
"“扔进水里！”她丈夫大叫道，“扔进水里！你疯了，葛朗台太太！我说话算数的，你很清楚这一点。如果你想要这个家太平，就让你的女儿坦白，全都说出来。女人们比我们更清楚该怎么办比较好。不管她干了什么，我不会吃了她的。她怕不怕我？即使她把夏尔从头到脚都抹上了金子，他也正呆在公海上，谁也抓不到他，对吧！”","“Into the water!” cried her husband, “into the water!You are crazy, Madame Grandet!What I have said is said; you know that well enough.If you want peace in this household, make your daughter confess, pump it out of her.Women understand how to do that better than we do.Whatever she has done, I sha’n’t eat her.Is she afraid of me?Even if she has plastered Charles with gold from head to foot, he is on the high seas, and nobody can get at him, hein!”"
"“可是，先生——”由于精神过度紧张以及惦念女儿的命运，葛朗台太太的心肠变软了，脑子变得更灵了，她突然发觉丈夫的肉瘤在可怕地抽动着，于是在回答时，她语气没变，话锋一转——“可是，先生，在她面前，我的威信可不如你。她什么都没跟我说，她像你。”","“But, monsieur—” Excited by the nervous crisis through which she had passed, and by the fate of her daughter, which brought forth all her tenderness and all her powers of mind, Madame Grandet suddenly observed a frightful movement of her husband’s wen, and, in the very act of replying, she changed her speech without changing the tones of her voice,—“But, monsieur, I have not more influence over her than you have.She has said nothing to me; she takes after you.”"
"“啧，啧！你今天早上可真会说话。得，得，得，得！你就没把我放在眼里，我知道。我猜你跟她是串通一气的。”","“Tut, tut!Your tongue is hung in the middle this morning.Ta, ta, ta, ta!You are setting me at defiance, I do believe.I daresay you are in league with her.”"
"他定睛盯着自己的妻子。","He looked fixedly at his wife."
"“葛朗台先生，如果你想杀了我，你就只管来杀吧。我告诉你，先生——即使要了我的命，我也要说——你不该这么对女儿，她比你占理。那钱是属于她的，她绝对能把钱用在正道上，只有上帝才有权力知道我们的善事。先生，我求求你，饶了欧仁妮吧，原谅她吧。如果你这样做了，就会减轻你的怒气给我造成的伤害，也许你能救了我的命。我的女儿！哦，先生，把我的女儿还给我吧！”","“Monsieur Grandet, if you wish to kill me, you have only to go on like this.I tell you, monsieur,—and if it were to cost me my life, I would say it,—you do wrong by your daughter; she is more in the right than you are.That money belonged to her; she is incapable of making any but a good use of it, and God alone has the right to know our good deeds.Monsieur, I implore you, take Eugenie back into favor; forgive her.If you will do this you will lessen the injury your anger has done me; perhaps you will save my life.My daughter! Oh, monsieur, give me back my daughter!”"
"“我要走了，”他说，“家里没法呆了。妈妈和女儿竟然这个样子讲话，这个样子争辩！呸——！噗！这就是你们新年给我送的大礼，欧仁妮，”他高声喊道，“好，好，哭去吧！你会为你做的事后悔的，你听到没？要是你把你父亲的金子都偷偷给了一个游手好闲的家伙，每三个月领六次圣餐又有什么用？等你没东西可给的时候，他会让你悲痛欲绝的。总有一天，你会发现你那个穿着摩洛哥皮靴、目空一切的夏尔是个什么货色。如果不经姑娘父母的同意，他就敢拿走她的私房钱，那他真是既没心肝，也没灵魂。”","“I shall decamp,” he said, “the house is not habitable.A mother and daughter talking and arguing like that!Broooouh!Pouah!A fine New Year’s present you’ve made me, Eugenie,” he called out.“Yes, yes, cry away!What you’ve done will bring you remorse, do you hear?What’s the good of taking the sacrament six times every three months, if you give away your father’s gold secretly to an idle fellow who’ll eat your heart out when you’ve nothing else to give him?You’ll find out some day what your Charles is worth, with his morocco boots and supercilious airs.He has got neither heart nor soul if he dared to carry off a young girl’s treasure without the consent of her parents.”"
"当街门关上后，欧仁妮从屋子出来去找她母亲。","When the street-door was shut, Eugenie came out of her room and went to her mother."
"“为了女儿，您可真有勇气！”她说。","“What courage you have had for your daughter’s sake!” she said."
"“啊！我的孩子，看看做了违禁的事，我们会有什么样的结果。你逼我撒了谎。”","“Ah! My child, see where forbidden things may lead us.You forced me to tell a lie.”"
"“我会请求上帝只惩罚我一个人。”","“I will ask God to punish only me.”"
"“是真的吗，”娜农惊慌地冲进来，嚷道，“小姐后半生就只能吃面包、喝水啦？”","“Is it true,” cried Nanon, rushing in alarmed, “that mademoiselle is to be kept on bread and water for the rest of her life?”"
"“那有什么，娜农？”欧仁妮平静地说道。","“What does that signify, Nanon?” said Eugenie tranquilly."
"“天哪！你的意思是我吃抹酱，而家里的小姐倒要吃干面包？不，不！”","“Goodness! Do you suppose I’ll eat @frippe@ when the daughter of the house is eating dry bread?No, no!”"
"“这件事一个字也别提了，娜农。”欧仁妮说。","“Don’t say a word about all this, Nanon,” said Eugenie."
"“我会默不作声的，不过，你们等着瞧吧！”","“I’ll be as mute as a fish; but you’ll see!”"
"二十四年来，葛朗台第一次单独吃晚饭。","Grandet dined alone for the first time in twenty-four years."
"“那么您成了鳏夫了，先生，”娜农说，“家里有两个女人，却成了鳏夫，一定不好受。”","“So you’re a widower, monsieur,” said Nanon, “it must be disagreeable to be a widower with two women in the house.”"
"“我没跟你说话。闭上你的嘴，不然我就把你赶走！我听到炉子上你的蒸锅煮着东西，那是什么？”","“I did not speak to you.Hold your jaw, or I’ll turn you off!What is that I hear boiling in your saucepan on the stove?”"
"“是我熬的油。”","“It is grease I’m trying out.”"
"“今天晚上有客。生上火。”","“There will be some company tonight.Light the fire.”"
"克吕绍一家、德格拉桑太太和她的儿子像往常一样，八点钟来了，他们既没看到葛朗台太太，也没看到她的女儿，感到很奇怪。","The Cruchots, Madame des Grassins, and her son arrived at the usual hour of eight, and were surprised to see neither Madame Grandet nor her daughter."
"“我的太太不太舒服，欧仁妮跟她在一起。”老葡萄园主说道，脸上没露出一丝破绽。","“My wife is not very well, and Eugenie is with her,” said the old wine-grower, whose face betrayed no emotion."
"闲聊了将近一个小时后，上楼去看葛朗台太太的德格拉桑太太下来了，大家都问道——","At the end of an hour spent in idle conversation, Madame des Grassins, who had gone up to see Madame Grandet, came down, and every one inquired,—"
"“葛朗台太太怎么样？”","“How is Madame Grandet?”"
"“很不好，”她答道，“我看她的状况似乎很让人担心。她这个年纪，您应该特别当心，葛朗台老爹。”","“Not at all well,” she answered, “her condition seems to me really alarming.At her age you ought to take every precaution, Papa Grandet.”"
"“我们会留心的。”老头漫不经心地说道。","“We’ll see about it,” said the old man in an absent way."
"他们都跟他道了晚安。等克吕绍一家走到大街上，德格拉桑太太对他们说——","They all wished him good-night.When the Cruchots got into the street Madame des Grassins said to them,—"
"“葛朗台家出事啦。母亲病得很厉害，而她自己并不知道。那姑娘两眼通红，好像一整天都在哭。难道是他们要违背她的意愿把她嫁出去？”","“There is something going on at the Grandets.The mother is very ill without her knowing it.The girl’s eyes are red, as if she had been crying all day.Can they be trying to marry her against her will?”"
"等葛朗台上了床，娜农没有穿鞋，只穿着袜子轻手轻脚来到了欧仁妮的房间，给了她一个用煎锅烤好的馅饼。","When Grandet had gone to bed Nanon came softly to Eugenie’s room in her stockinged feet and showed her a pate baked in a saucepan."
"“看，小姐，”这个好心人说，“科努瓦耶给了我一只野兔。你饭量小，这个馅饼够你吃上一个星期的；这么冷的天气，坏不了的。我是下定决心了，你可不能光吃干面包，那对身体不好。”","“See, mademoiselle,” said the good soul, “Cornoiller gave me a hare.You eat so little that this pate will last you full a week; in such frosty weather it won’t spoil.You sha’n’t live on dry bread, I’m determined; it isn’t wholesome.”"
"“可怜的娜农！”欧仁妮说着，握紧了她的手。","“Poor Nanon!” said Eugenie, pressing her hand."
"“我做得好极了，很香的，他一点儿没发觉。我用我那六法郎买了猪油和香料：我自个儿的钱，我做主。”说着，她觉得似乎听到了葛朗台的声音，便迅速离开了。","“I’ve made it downright good and dainty, and @he@ never found it out.I bought the lard and the spices out of my six francs: I’m the mistress of my own money,” and she disappeared rapidly, fancying she heard Grandet."
"第十一章","Chapter XI "
"几个月来，老葡萄园主白天经常不定时地来到他妻子的房间，他从不提女儿的名字，也不去看她，连半点儿提及她的话都没有。葛朗台太太没有离开过她的卧室，状态一天比一天糟。无论什么也无法让老头的心肠变软，他一直无动于衷、严厉、冷漠，像块花岗石一样。他像平时一样继续进进出出，忙着他的事；不过他不再结巴了，话也少了，在买卖交易上比以前更苛刻了。他经常会加错数。","For several months the old wine-grower came constantly to his wife’s room at all hours of the day, without ever uttering his daughter’s name, or seeing her, or making the smallest allusion to her.Madame Grandet did not leave her chamber, and daily grew worse.Nothing softened the old man; he remained unmoved, harsh, and cold as a granite rock.He continued to go and come about his business as usual; but ceased to stutter, talked less, and was more obdurate in business transactions than ever before.Often he made mistakes in adding up his figures."
"“葛朗台家出事了。”格拉桑派和克吕绍派都说道。","“Something is going on at the Grandets,” said the Grassinists and the Cruchotines."
"“葛朗台家里出了什么事？”这变成了一个固定的问题，在索米尔晚上的小聚会上，人人都会这样问。欧仁妮去望弥撒都是由娜农陪着。从教堂出来时，如果德格拉桑太太跟她搭上几句话，她的回答总是躲躲闪闪，无法满足对方的好奇心。但是两个月后，欧仁妮被幽禁的事实再也不可能瞒过三位克吕绍以及德格拉桑太太了。这个时候，所有的借口都无法成为她总是不露面的托辞了。接着，尽管无法找出是谁泄露了秘密，全城的人都知道了从新年那天开始，葛朗台小姐就被她父亲下令关在她的房间里，没有生火，只能吃面包、喝水，娜农会做点好吃的，夜里偷偷给她送去。大家甚至知道，那个姑娘不能去看望和照顾自己的母亲，只能等她父亲偶尔不在家时才行。","“What has happened in the Grandet family?” became a fixed question which everybody asked everybody else at the little evening-parties of Saumur.Eugenie went to Mass escorted by Nanon.If Madame des Grassins said a few words to her on coming out of church, she answered in an evasive manner, without satisfying any curiosity.However, at the end of two months, it became impossible to hide, either from the three Cruchots or from Madame des Grassins, the fact that Eugenie was in confinement.There came a moment when all pretexts failed to explain her perpetual absence.Then, though it was impossible to discover by whom the secret had been betrayed, all the town became aware that ever since New Year’s day Mademoiselle Grandet had been kept in her room without fire, on bread and water, by her father’s orders, and that Nanon cooked little dainties and took them to her secretly at night.It was even known that the young woman was not able to see or take care of her mother, except at certain times when her father was out of the house."
"葛朗台的行为受到了严厉的谴责。可以说，全城人都视他为不法之徒；他们想起了他的背信弃义、他的冷酷心肠，并把他逐出了教会。当他在街上经过时，人们对他指指点点，小声议论着。当他的女儿由娜农陪着，走过弯弯曲曲的街道，去望弥撒或者做晚祷时，居民们跑到窗前，非常好奇地打量着这个富家女的一举一动和她那张带着忧郁和天使般温柔的面孔。她根本不在乎自己被幽禁和她父亲所受的谴责。她不是有一张世界地图，有小长凳、花园和围墙拐角吗？她不是总在回味爱情之吻留在她唇间的甜蜜吗？正如葛朗台一样，她一度根本不知道全城人都在议论她。在上帝面前，她心地虔诚而纯洁，她的良知和她的爱情帮助她耐心地忍受着她父亲的愤怒和报复。","Grandet’s conduct was severely condemned.The whole town outlawed him, so to speak; they remembered his treachery, his hard-heartedness, and they excommunicated him.When he passed along the streets, people pointed him out and muttered at him.When his daughter came down the winding street, accompanied by Nanon, on her way to Mass or Vespers, the inhabitants ran to the windows and examined with intense curiosity the bearing of the rich heiress and her countenance, which bore the impress of angelic gentleness and melancholy.Her imprisonment and the condemnation of her father were as nothing to her.Had she not a map of the world, the little bench, the garden, the angle of the wall?Did she not taste upon her lips the honey that love’s kisses left there?She was ignorant for a time that the town talked about her, just as Grandet himself was ignorant of it.Pious and pure in heart before God, her conscience and her love helped her to suffer patiently the wrath and vengeance of her father."
"一种深深的痛苦压过了其他一切痛苦。她的母亲，那个温柔慈祥的人，在接近生命的尽头时，由内而外散发的光辉使她显得很美——她的母亲正在一天一天地枯槁。欧仁妮经常责备自己无意中给母亲带来这场疾病，它正慢慢地、残忍地耗尽母亲的生命。这种悔恨，虽然有母亲的宽慰，却把她和她的爱情联系得更紧密了。每天早上，等她父亲一出门，她就来到母亲床边，娜农给她把早点端到那里。可怜的姑娘很伤心，为了母亲的痛苦而痛苦，她哭着把脸转向老佣人默默示意，但是也不敢提起她的堂弟。是葛朗台太太首先鼓起勇气，开口说道——","One deep grief silenced all others.Her mother, that gentle, tender creature, made beautiful by the light which shone from the inner to the outer as she approached the tomb,—her mother was perishing from day to day.Eugenie often reproached herself as the innocent cause of the slow, cruel malady that was wasting her away.This remorse, though her mother soothed it, bound her still closer to her love.Every morning, as soon as her father left the house, she went to the bedside of her mother, and there Nanon brought her breakfast.The poor girl, sad, and suffering through the sufferings of her mother, would turn her face to the old servant with a mute gesture, weeping, and yet not daring to speak of her cousin.It was Madame Grandet who first found courage to say,—"
"“他在哪里？他为什么不写信？”","“Where is @he@?Why does @he@ not write?”"
"“咱们就心里想想他吧，母亲，但是别提他。您在生病——您比一切都重要。”","“Let us think about him, mother, but not speak of him.You are ill—you, before all.”"
"“一切”的意思是“他”。","“All” meant “him.”"
"“我的孩子，”葛朗台太太说，“我对活着不抱希望。上帝保佑我，让我能够高高兴兴地看到我的苦难要结束了。”","“My child,” said Madame Grandet, “I do not wish to live.God protects me and enables me to look with joy to the end of my misery.”"
"这个女人的每一句话总是虔诚而富于基督精神的。在那一年的头几个月，有时，当她的丈夫来和她共进早餐，并在屋子里踱来踱去的时候，她会对他说些充满宗教精神的话，她说话时总是如天使般温柔，但是口气坚决，对一个女人来说，即将到来的死亡赋予了她平生所没有的勇气。","Every utterance of this woman was unfalteringly pious and Christian.Sometimes, during the first months of the year, when her husband came to breakfast with her and tramped up and down the room, she would say to him a few religious words, always spoken with angelic sweetness, yet with the firmness of a woman to whom approaching death lends a courage she had lacked in life."
"“先生，我很感谢你对我的健康这么关心，”每当他循例问候时，她会回答道，“不过，你如果真的想让我在最后的时日里少一点痛苦，让我的悲伤减轻些，那就饶了你的女儿吧：做个真正的基督徒，做得像个丈夫和父亲的样子。”","“Monsieur, I thank you for the interest you take in my health,” she would answer when he made some commonplace inquiry, “but if you really desire to render my last moments less bitter and to ease my grief, take back your daughter: be a Christian, a husband, and a father.”"
"每当听到这番话时，葛朗台就会坐在床边，那神情就好像一个人看见大雨将至而静静地躲在门洞下直至雨停的样子。等她说完这些动人、温柔，而且虔诚的恳求后，他会说道——","When he heard these words, Grandet would sit down by the bed with the air of a man who sees the rain coming and quietly gets under the shelter of a gateway till it is over.When these touching, tender, and religious supplications had all been made, he would say,—"
"“你今天脸色很苍白，我可怜的太太。”","“You are rather pale today, my poor wife.”"
"彻底忘掉女儿这个打算似乎刻在了他紧绷的额头和紧闭的嘴唇上。当可怜的妻子听到他这番不着边际的回答时，她苍白的面颊上淌下了泪水，他也不为之所动。","Absolute forgetfulness of his daughter seemed graven on his stony brow, on his closed lips.He was unmoved by the tears which flowed down the white cheeks of his unhappy wife as she listened to his meaningless answers."
"“愿上帝原谅你，”她说，“就像我原谅你一样！你总有一天会需要宽恕的。”","“May God pardon you,” she said, “even as I pardon you!You will some day stand in need of mercy.”"
"自从葛朗台太太病倒后，他还没敢用过他那可怕的“得、得、得、得！”呢。可尽管如此，他暴虐的本性并没有被这个温柔的天使给感化掉。这个天使外貌的丑陋在一天天减少，取而代之的是辉映在她脸上的那难以形容的精神之美。她的灵魂一片纯净。祈祷的灵性似乎净化了她，让她其貌不扬的相貌变得优雅，而且焕发起光彩来。圣洁的脸庞上，灵魂的习性战胜了最平凡的相貌，由于纯洁而高尚的内心思想而给相貌平添了精神上的光彩，这类脱胎换骨的现象谁没有见过呢？这个女人在挣扎中耗尽生命，而使容貌大变的景象，确实让这个老箍桶匠有所触动，不过，影响甚微，因为他的本性像铁一样硬。如果说他的用语不再那么轻蔑了，那沉着静默则取而代之，并成了他的行为准则，这也保全了他作为一家之主的尊严。","Since Madame Grandet’s illness he had not dared to make use of his terrible “Ta, ta, ta, ta!”Yet, for all that, his despotic nature was not disarmed by this angel of gentleness, whose ugliness day by day decreased, driven out by the ineffable expression of moral qualities which shone upon her face.She was all soul.The spirit of prayer seemed to purify her and refine those homely features and make them luminous.Who has not seen the phenomenon of a like transfiguration on sacred faces where the habits of the soul have triumphed over the plainest features, giving them that spiritual illumination whose light comes from the purity and nobility of the inward thought?The spectacle of this transformation wrought by the struggle which consumed the last shreds of the human life of this woman, did somewhat affect the old cooper, though feebly, for his nature was of iron; if his language ceased to be contemptuous, an imperturbable silence, which saved his dignity as master of the household, took its place and ruled his conduct."
"当忠心耿耿的娜农出现在市场上时，许多针对她主子的挖苦话、俏皮话和埋怨会传到她耳朵里；不过不管公众舆论谴责葛朗台先生的声音有多大，这个老佣人为了东家的荣誉，总要替他辩护。","When the faithful Nanon appeared in the market, many quips and quirks and complaints about the master whistled in her ears; but however loudly public opinion condemned Monsieur Grandet, the old servant defended him, for the honor of the family."
"“好吧！”她会对诋毁他的人说，“等我们老了，我们的心肠不都会变硬吗？为什么他就不应该也变得硬些？别胡说八道。小姐过得像个王后一样。不错，她是单独呆着，不过，她喜欢那样。还有，我家主人自有他们的道理。”","“Well!” she would say to his detractors, “don’t we all get hard as we grow old?Why shouldn’t he get horny too?Stop telling lies.Mademoiselle lives like a queen.She’s alone, that’s true; but she likes it.Besides, my masters have good reasons.”"
"终于，等春天快过完的时候，葛朗台太太被疾病，甚至可以说是被痛苦折磨得虚弱不堪，尽管她苦苦祈祷，也没能让父女俩和解，于是她把心里的烦恼吐露给了克吕绍叔侄。","At last, towards the end of spring, Madame Grandet, worn out by grief even more than by illness, having failed, in spite of her prayers, to reconcile the father and daughter, confided her secret troubles to the Cruchots."
"“让一个二十三岁的姑娘光吃面包、喝水！”德蓬丰先生叫了起来，“而且还毫无道理！唉呀，那构成了非法虐待罪，她可以上告，理由是——”","“Keep a girl of twenty-three on bread and water!” cried Monsieur de Bonfons, “without any reason, too!Why, that constitutes wrongful cruelty; she can contest, as much in as upon—” "
"“得啦，侄儿，别给我们讲你那些法律术语了，”公证人说，“您放心，夫人，明天我就会终止这种虐待的。”","“Come, nephew, spare us your legal jargon,” said the notary.“Set your mind at ease, madame; I will put a stop to such treatment tomorrow.”"
"欧仁妮听见他们提到自己，便从她的房间里走了出来。","Eugenie, hearing herself mentioned, came out of her room."
"“先生们，”她高傲地一步走上前来，说道，“我求你们不要插手这件事。我父亲是他自己家的主人。只要我生活在他的屋檐下，我就必须服从他。他的行为无须得到别人的赞成或者反对，他只对上帝负责。我请求你们以友谊为重，在这件事上保持完全的沉默。责备我的父亲就是攻击我们家族的名誉。我非常感谢你们对我的关心；我偶尔听到城里正流传的一些令人不快的流言蜚语，如果你们能制止的话，那算是又帮了我一个忙了。”","“Gentlemen,” she said, coming forward with a proud step, “I beg you not to interfere in this matter.My father is master in his own house.As long as I live under his roof I am bound to obey him.His conduct is not subject to the approbation or the disapprobation of the world; he is accountable to God only.I appeal to your friendship to keep total silence in this affair.To blame my father is to attack our family honor.I am much obliged to you for the interest you have shown in me; you will do me an additional service if you will put a stop to the offensive rumors which are current in the town, of which I am accidentally informed.”"
"“她说得对。”葛朗台太太说。","“She is right,” said Madame Grandet."
"“小姐，阻止流言最好的方法是获取你的自由。”老公证人被那幽居、忧伤和爱情印在她脸上的美丽打动了，他恭敬地答道。","“Mademoiselle, the best way to stop such rumors is to procure your liberty,” answered the old notary respectfully, struck with the beauty which seclusion, melancholy, and love had stamped upon her face."
"“好的，孩子，既然克吕绍先生这么有把握成功，就让他处理这件事吧。他了解你的父亲，知道怎么应付他。如果你希望看到我在所剩无几的余生里活得快乐，无论如何，你必须跟你父亲和解。”","“Well, my daughter, let Monsieur Cruchot manage the matter if he is so sure of success.He understands your father, and how to manage him.If you wish to see me happy for my few remaining days, you must, at any cost, be reconciled to your father.”"
"第二天，按照自从欧仁妮被禁闭后就开始养成的习惯，葛朗台在小花园里来来回回走了好几圈，他挑的是欧仁妮梳理头发的时间。当老头走到胡桃树下时，他躲到树干后面，盯着女儿的一举一动看了好一会儿，或许，他在服从他固执的本性和拥抱孩子这种出于天性的愿望之间犹豫不决。有时候，他坐在那条破旧的长凳上，夏尔和欧仁妮曾经在那里立下海誓山盟；而这时，欧仁妮也会站在镜子前，偷偷地看着父亲。要是他站起来，继续散步，她就饶有兴味地坐到窗前，看着那挂着淡色花朵的围墙角，在那里，铁线蕨、蔓藤和景天草从缝隙里长了出来——景天草是一种白色或者黄色的景天植物，索米尔和图尔的葡萄园里有很多。克吕绍公证人很早就来了，发现老葡萄园主在这晴好的六月天里坐在小长凳上，背靠着花园的隔墙，专注地望着自己的女儿。","On the morrow Grandet, in pursuance of a custom he had begun since Eugenie’s imprisonment, took a certain number of turns up and down the little garden; he had chosen the hour when Eugenie brushed and arranged her hair.When the old man reached the walnut-tree he hid behind its trunk and remained for a few moments watching his daughter’s movements, hesitating, perhaps, between the course to which the obstinacy of his character impelled him and his natural desire to embrace his child.Sometimes he sat down on the rotten old bench where Charles and Eugenie had vowed eternal love; and then she, too, looked at her father secretly in the mirror before which she stood.If he rose and continued his walk, she sat down obligingly at the window and looked at the angle of the wall where the pale flowers hung, where the Venus-hair grew from the crevices with the bindweed and the sedum,—a white or yellow stone-crop very abundant in the vineyards of Saumur and at Tours.Maitre Cruchot came early, and found the old wine-grower sitting in the fine June weather on the little bench, his back against the division wall of the garden, engaged in watching his daughter."
"“您有什么事吗，克吕绍公证人先生？”他看见了公证人，说道。","“What may you want, Maitre Cruchot?” he said, perceiving the notary."
"“我是来和您谈正事的。”","“I came to speak to you on business.”"
"“啊！啊！您是拿了些金子来换我的银子吗？”","“Ah! Ah! Have you brought some gold in exchange for my silver?”"
"“不，不，我来不是为了钱，是为了您的女儿欧仁妮。整个城里都在议论她和您。”","“No, no, I have not come about money; it is about your daughter Eugenie.All the town is talking of her and you.”"
"“城里人管得着吗？一个人的家就是他的城堡。”","“What does the town meddle for?A man’s house is his castle.”"
"“非常正确，只要愿意，一个人可以去自杀，或者更糟糕一些，他可以把自己的钱扔到阴沟里。”","“Very true; and a man may kill himself if he likes, or, what is worse, he may fling his money into the gutter.”"
"“您是什么意思？”","“What do you mean?”"
"“嗨，您的妻子病得很厉害，我的朋友。您应该请贝日冷先生来看看，她可能要死了。如果她因为得不到应有的医治而死，我想您的内心会非常不安的。”","“Why, your wife is very ill, my friend.You ought to consult Monsieur Bergerin; she is likely to die.If she does die without receiving proper care, you will not be very easy in mind, I take it.”"
"“得，得，得，得！您很清楚我妻子的事！这些医生，他们一旦踏进了你的家门，一天就会来上五六趟。”","“Ta, ta, ta, ta! You know a deal about my wife!These doctors, if they once get their foot in your house, will come five and six times a day.”"
"“当然，您觉得怎么做最好就怎么做吧。我们是老朋友，在索米尔，没有谁比我更关心您的事了。所以我一定要把这件事告诉您。不过，不管怎么样，您有权做您想做的事，您可以选择您自己的做法。再有，那并不是我此行的目的。还有一件事对您来说可能会有严重的后果。毕竟，您不可能希望害死自己的妻子，她的命对于您可是太重要了。要是葛朗台太太死了，想想您在您女儿面前的处境。您必须把账目交给欧仁妮，因为您只在您妻子的有生之年才享有她的财产。她一死，您的女儿就可以申请分割财产，她可能会迫使您卖掉弗罗瓦丰的。简而言之，她是她母亲的继承人，而您不是。”","“Of course you will do as you think best.We are old friends; there is no one in all Saumur who takes more interest than I in what concerns you.Therefore, I was bound to tell you this.However, happen what may, you have the right to do as you please; you can choose your own course.Besides, that is not what brings me here.There is another thing which may have serious results for you.After all, you can’t wish to kill your wife; her life is too important to you.Think of your situation in connection with your daughter if Madame Grandet dies.You must render an account to Eugenie, because you enjoy your wife’s estate only during her lifetime.At her death your daughter can claim a division of property, and she may force you to sell Froidfond.In short, she is her mother’s heir, and you are not.”"
"这番话对老头来说简直像晴天霹雳一样，他对法律可没有对做生意那么在行。他从来没想过财产的法律分割问题。","These words fell like a thunderbolt on the old man, who was not as wise about law as he was about business.He had never thought of a legal division of the estate."
"“因此，我建议您要善待她。”克吕绍最后又说道。","“Therefore I advise you to treat her kindly,” added Cruchot, in conclusion."
"“但是您知道她做了什么吗，克吕绍？”","“But do you know what she has done, Cruchot?”"
"“什么？”公证人问道，他好奇地想听听事实的真相，并搞清这次争吵的缘由。","“What?” asked the notary, curious to hear the truth and find out the cause of the quarrel."
"“她把她的金子给了别人！”","“She has given away her gold!”"
"“那么，金子不是她的吗？”公证人说。","“Well, wasn’t it hers?” said the notary."
"“他们都是这样跟我说的！”老头把他的胳膊垂到身体两侧，做了个很悲痛的动作，大声嚷道。","“They all tell me that!” exclaimed the old man, letting his arms fall to his sides with a movement that was truly tragic."
"“难道就为了一件微不足道的小事，”克吕绍接着说，“您就不打算请求女儿在她母亲死后对您做出让步吗？”","“Are you going—for a mere nothing,”resumed Cruchot, “to put obstacles in the way of the concessions which you will be obliged to ask from your daughter as soon as her mother dies?”"
"“您把六千法郎叫做一件微不足道的小事？”","“Do you call six thousand francs a mere nothing?”"
"“嘿！我的老朋友，您知道要是欧仁妮要求分割财产的话，您妻子的财产造表要花多少钱吗？”","“Hey! My old friend, do you know what the inventory of your wife’s property will cost, if Eugenie demands the division?”"
"“多少？”","“How much?”"
"“两千，或者三千，甚至四千法郎！财产要进行拍卖和出售，以便获知它的实际价值。要不想这样，如果你们处好了关系——”","“Two, three, four thousand francs, perhaps!The property would have to be put up at auction and sold, to get at its actual value.Instead of that, if you are on good terms with—” "
"“凭我老父的剪刀作证！”葛朗台大声叫了起来，他猛地坐下，脸色苍白，“这个我们以后再谈，克吕绍。”","“By the shears of my father!” cried Grandet, turning pale as he suddenly sat down, “we will see about it, Cruchot.”"
"沉默了一会儿之后，老头似乎内心满是痛苦，他看着公证人，说道——","After a moment’s silence, full of anguish perhaps, the old man looked at the notary and said,—"
"“人生是非常艰难的！有很多痛苦！克吕绍，”他严肃地接着说道，“您不会骗我吧？以您的名誉跟我发誓，您跟我讲的所有话都是有法律依据的。给我看看那条法律，我必须要看到那条法律！”","“Life is very hard!It has many griefs!Cruchot,” he continued solemnly, “you would not deceive me?Swear to me upon your honor that all you’ve told me is legally true.Show me the law; I must see the law!”"
"“我可怜的朋友，”公证人说，“我会不清楚自己的本行吗？”","“My poor friend,” said the notary, “don’t I know my own business?”"
"“这么说，就是真的了！我要被我自己的女儿抢劫、背叛、杀死、毁灭了！”","“Then it is true!I am robbed, betrayed, killed, destroyed by my own daughter!”"
"“您的女儿是她母亲的继承人，的确如此。”","“It is true that your daughter is her mother’s heir.”"
"“要子女有什么用？啊！我的妻子，我爱她！幸亏她身体很健康，她是贝尔特利耶家的人。”","“Why do we have children?Ah! My wife, I love her!Luckily she’s sound and healthy; she’s a Bertelliere.”"
"“她活不过一个月了。”","“She has not a month to live.”"
"葛朗台拍拍脑门，走了几步，又走回来，恶狠狠地看着克吕绍，说道——　","Grandet struck his forehead, went a few steps, came back, cast a dreadful look on Cruchot, and said,—"
"“怎么办？”","“What can be done?”"
"“欧仁妮可以放弃对她母亲财产的继承权。如果她这样做的话，我猜您不会剥夺她的继承权吧？——不过您要是想这样解决的话，您就一定不要亏待她。老头，我跟您说的话对我是不利的。要不是有债务清偿、财产造表、产权转让、财产分割——我靠什么活呢？”","“Eugenie can relinquish her claim to her mother’s property.Should she do this you would not disinherit her, I presume?—But if you want to come to such a settlement, you must not treat her harshly.What I am telling you, old man, is against my own interests.What do I live by, if it isn’t liquidations, inventories, conveyances, divisions of property?—” "
"“我们以后再说，以后再说！别再说它了，克吕绍，这件事搞得我心神不宁。您收到金子了吗？”","“We’ll see, we’ll see!Don’t let’s talk any more about it, Cruchot; it wrings my vitals.Have you received any gold?”"
"“没有，不过我有几个旧金路易，十二个左右，可以给您。我的好朋友，跟欧仁妮和解吧。您难道不知道整个索米尔都在攻击您吗？”","“No; but I have a few old louis, a dozen or so, which you may have.My good friend, make it up with Eugenie.Don’t you know all Saumur is pelting you with stones?”"
"“那些无赖！”","“The scoundrels!”"
"“喂，公债是九十九啦。您一辈子总可以满意一次啦。”","“Come, the Funds are at ninety-nine.Do be satisfied for once in your life.”"
"“九十九！是吗，克吕绍？”","“At ninety-nine!Are they, Cruchot?”"
"“是的。”","“Yes.”"
"“嘿，嘿！九十九！”老头一边反复念叨着，一边陪着公证人走到了街门。刚才听到的那番话让他激动得在屋子里呆不住，于是，他便去了妻子的房间，说道——","“Hey, hey!Ninety-nine!” repeated the old man, accompanying the notary to the street-door.Then, too agitated by what he had just heard to stay in the house, he went up to his wife’s room and said,—"
"“嘿，孩子她妈，你白天可以让女儿陪着你。我要去弗罗瓦丰。祝你们俩过得愉快。今天是咱们的结婚纪念日，太太。看看！这是给你的圣体瞻礼节搭祭坛用的六十法郎，这事你想了很久了。得啦，高兴点，过得开心，早日康复！快乐万岁！”","“Come, mother, you may have your daughter to spend the day with you.I’m going to Froidfond.Enjoy yourselves, both of you.This is our wedding-day, wife.See! Here are sixty francs for your altar at the Fete-Dieu; you’ve wanted one for a long time.Come, cheer up, enjoy yourself, and get well!Hurrah for happiness!”"
"他把十枚六法郎的银币扔到床上，用手捧起他妻子的头，吻了吻她的前额。","He threw ten silver pieces of six francs each upon the bed, and took his wife’s head between his hands and kissed her forehead."
"“我的好太太，你会好起来的，是不是？”","“My good wife, you are getting well, are not you?”"
"“你连你的女儿都不肯原谅，又怎么能指望在家里接待慈悲的上帝呢？”她激动地说道。","“How can you think of receiving the God of mercy in your house when you refuse to forgive your daughter?” she said with emotion."
"“得，得，得，得！”葛朗台哄着她说道，“我们以后再说。”","“Ta, ta, ta, ta!” said Grandet in a coaxing voice.“We’ll see about that.”"
"“仁慈的上帝呀！欧仁妮，”母亲高兴得满脸通红，大声喊道，“来吻一吻你的父亲，他原谅你了！”","“Merciful heaven!Eugenie,” cried the mother, flushing with joy, “come and kiss your father; he forgives you!”"
"但是，老头已经不见了身影。他甩开两腿，尽力快步地跑向他的葡萄园，想把他混乱的思绪理清。葛朗台已经七十六岁。在最近这两年里，他的贪婪变本加厉，就像人到了一定岁数，所有长年累月的癖好都会有增无减一样。似乎是为了印证一项对守财奴、野心家和那些一辈子死抱着一种想法的人的观察，他的感情已牢牢拴在象征他的嗜好的某件东西上了。看见金子、拥有金子已经成了他的一种狂热追求。他专制的思想随着他的贪婪成比例地增长，要他在妻子死后放弃哪怕最小一部分财产的支配权，对他来说，似乎都是一件“违背天理”的事情。要向他的女儿公布财产，要把他的不动产和动产的资产造表做出登记，好分割财产——　","But the old man had disappeared.He was going as fast as his legs could carry him towards his vineyards, trying to get his confused ideas into order.Grandet had entered his seventy-sixth year.During the last two years his avarice had increased upon him, as all the persistent passions of men increase at a certain age.As if to illustrate an observation which applies equally to misers, ambitious men, and others whose lives are controlled by any dominant idea, his affections had fastened upon one special symbol of his passion.The sight of gold, the possession of gold, had become a monomania.His despotic spirit had grown in proportion to his avarice, and to part with the control of the smallest fraction of his property at the death of his wife seemed to him a thing “against nature.”To declare his fortune to his daughter, to give an inventory of his property, landed and personal, for the purposes of division—"
"“唉呀，”他在一个园子里假装查看一株葡萄藤，在园子中间，他高声喊道，“那简直就是割断我的喉咙！”","“Why,” he cried aloud in the midst of a field where he was pretending to examine a vine, “it would be cutting my throat!”"
"最后，他拿定了主意，晚饭时回到索米尔，决心向欧仁妮屈服，爱抚她，哄骗她，以便他死时还能像帝王一样，只要有一口气在，他就得掌握那百万家产的大权。老头碰巧口袋里装着他的百宝钥匙，他开了门，蹑手蹑脚地爬上楼，进了他妻子的房间。这时，欧仁妮已经从橡木柜子里拿出那个漂亮的梳妆箱，放在了她母亲的床上。母女二人趁葛朗台不在，喜滋滋地端详着夏尔母亲的肖像，想找出她和夏尔相像的地方。","He came at last to a decision, and returned to Saumur in time for dinner, resolved to unbend to Eugenie, and pet and coax her, that he might die regally, holding the reins of his millions in his own hands so long as the breath was in his body.At the moment when the old man, who chanced to have his pass-key in his pocket, opened the door and climbed with a stealthy step up the stairway to go into his wife’s room, Eugenie had brought the beautiful dressing-case from the oak cabinet and placed it on her mother’s bed.Mother and daughter, in Grandet’s absence, allowed themselves the pleasure of looking for a likeness to Charles in the portrait of his mother."
"“这不正是他的额头和他的嘴嘛。”欧仁妮正说时，老头推开了门。一看到丈夫看着金子的目光，葛朗台太太大叫起来——","“It is exactly his forehead and his mouth,” Eugenie was saying as the old man opened the door.At the look which her husband cast upon the gold, Madame Grandet cried out,—"
"“哦，上帝啊，可怜可怜我们吧！”","“O God, have pity upon us!”"
"老头纵身向箱子扑去，就像一只饿虎扑向一个熟睡的孩子一样。","The old man sprang upon the box as a famished tiger might spring upon a sleeping child."
"“这是什么？”他说着，一把抓住了宝贝，拿着它跑到了窗边。“金子，真金！”他叫着，“纯金的——足有两磅重！哈，哈！夏尔用这个换走了你的钱，是不是？嗯！你为什么没跟我说？这笔买卖可真划算，小乖乖！是的，你是我的女儿，我看出来了——”欧仁妮四肢都在颤抖。“这是夏尔的，当然是他的，是不是？”老头接着说。","“What’s this?” he said, snatching the treasure and carrying it to the window.“Gold, good gold!” he cried.“All gold,—it weighs two pounds!Ha, ha!Charles gave you that for your money, did he?Hein!Why didn’t you tell me so?It was a good bargain, little one!Yes, you are my daughter, I see that—” Eugenie trembled in every limb.“This came from Charles, of course, didn’t it?” continued the old man."
"“是的，父亲，这不是我的东西。这是神圣的托付。”","“Yes, father; it is not mine.It is a sacred trust.”"
"“得，得，得，得！他拿走了你的钱，现在你可以拿回来了。”","“Ta, ta, ta, ta!He took your fortune, and now you can get it back.”"
"“父亲！”","“Father!”"
"葛朗台拿起他的刀子要撬下一些金子，为了方便，他把梳妆箱放在了一把椅子上。欧仁妮冲上前想夺回来，可她的父亲一直在盯着她和那宝贝，他用胳膊狠狠推了她一把，她便摔倒在母亲的床上。","Grandet took his knife to pry out some of the gold; to do this, he placed the dressing-case on a chair.Eugenie sprang forward to recover it; but her father, who had his eye on her and on the treasure too, pushed her back so violently with a thrust of his arm that she fell upon her mother’s bed."
"“先生，先生！”母亲坐起身来，喊道。","“Monsieur, monsieur!” cried the mother, lifting herself up."
"葛朗台已拔出了刀子，正准备用它撬金子。","Grandet had opened his knife, and was about to apply it to the gold."
"“父亲！”欧仁妮大声叫着，她跪下来，握紧两手，爬到他的身边，“父亲，看在所有的圣徒和圣母的份上！看在死在十字架上的基督的份上！看在您将永远得到救赎的份上，父亲！为了我的性命，父亲！——别去动那箱子！它既不是您的，也不是我的。它是一个不幸的亲人托付到我手中的：我一定要完好无损地还给他！”","“Father!” cried Eugenie, falling on her knees and dragging herself close to him with clasped hands, “Father, in the name of all the saints and the Virgin! In the name of Christ who died upon the cross! In the name of your eternal salvation, father! For my life’s sake, father!—do not touch that!It is neither yours nor mine.It is a trust placed in my hands by an unhappy relation: I must give it back to him uninjured!”"
"“如果是托你代管的东西，你为什么还要看？看它和动它一样恶劣。”","“If it is a trust, why were you looking at it?To look at it is as bad as touching it.”"
"“父亲，别弄坏了它，否则您会让我丢尽脸的！父亲，您听见了吗？”","“Father, don’t destroy it, or you will disgrace me!Father, do you hear?”"
"“哦，发发慈悲吧！”母亲说。","“Oh, have pity!” said the mother."
"“父亲！”欧仁妮大声叫道，声音骇人，吓得娜农跑上了楼。欧仁妮扑向手边的一把刀子。","“Father!” cried Eugenie in so startling a voice that Nanon ran upstairs terrified.Eugenie sprang upon a knife that was close at hand."
"“好吧，现在要怎么样？”葛朗台冷笑一声，冷冷地说道。","“Well, what now?” said Grandet coldly, with a callous smile."
"“哦，你是要我的命啊！”母亲说。","“Oh, you are killing me!” said the mother."
"“父亲，如果您的刀子割下哪怕一丁点金子，我就把这把刀刺向我自己！您已经把我母亲逼得快要死了，现在又要杀死自己的孩子！随您的便！一命换一命！”","“Father, if your knife so much as cuts a fragment of that gold, I will stab myself with this one!You have already driven my mother to her death; you will now kill your child!Do as you choose!Wound for wound!”"
"葛朗台一边举刀对着梳妆箱，一边看着女儿，犹豫着。","Grandet held his knife over the dressing-case and hesitated as he looked at his daughter."
"“你真会那么做吗，欧仁妮？”他说。","“Are you capable of doing it, Eugenie?” he said."
"“是的，是的！”母亲说道。","“Yes, yes!” said the mother."
"“她会说到做到的！”娜农喊道，“讲点道理，先生，一辈子就讲这一次理吧。”","“She’ll do it if she says so!” cried Nanon.“Be reasonable, monsieur, for once in your life.”"
"老头看看金子，然后又看看他的女儿，来来回回看了一会儿。葛朗台太太晕了过去。","The old man looked at the gold and then at his daughter alternately for an instant.Madame Grandet fainted."
"“瞧瞧！先生，您看见没？太太快死了！”娜农大喊着。","“There! Don’t you see, monsieur, that madame is dying?” cried Nanon."
"“得啦，得啦，我的女儿，咱们别为了一个箱子吵架！得啦，拿走吧！”他一边把箱子往床上一扔，一边急忙喊道，“娜农，去叫贝日冷先生！喂，孩子她妈，”他一边说，他一边吻着妻子的手，“一切都过去了！你看！我们和好了——不是吗，小乖乖？不要再吃干面包了，你想吃什么就吃什么——啊，她睁开眼睛了！好的，孩子她妈，孩子她妈，得啦！瞧，我正在吻欧仁妮哪！她爱她的堂弟，她要是愿意，就嫁给他吧，她就保管他的箱子好了。可千万别死，孩子她妈；要活得长寿，我可怜的太太！嗨，试着动动！听着！你会有索米尔最好的祭坛。”","“Come, come, my daughter, we won’t quarrel for a box!Here, take it!” he cried hastily, flinging the case upon the bed.“Nanon, go and fetch Monsieur Bergerin!Come, mother,” said he, kissing his wife’s hand, “it’s all over!There! We’ve made up—haven’t we, little one?No more dry bread; you shall have all you want—Ah, she opens her eyes!Well, mother, little mother, come!See, I’m kissing Eugenie!She loves her cousin, and she may marry him if she wants to; she may keep his case.But don’t die, mother; live a long time yet, my poor wife!Come, try to move!Listen! You shall have the finest altar that ever was made in Saumur.”"
"“哦，你怎么能这样对待你的妻子和女儿！”葛朗台太太声音微弱地说道。","“Oh, how can you treat your wife and daughter so!” said Madame Grandet in a feeble voice."
"“我不会再那样了，永远不会，”她的丈夫大声说道，“你就瞧着吧，我可怜的太太！”他去了他的密室，拿了一把金路易回来，撒到床上。“瞧瞧，欧仁妮！看看，太太！这些都是给你们的，”他一边说着，一边摆弄着那些硬币，“喂，高兴点，太太！心情好些，身体就能好，你要什么就有什么，欧仁妮也一样。这是给她的一百个金路易。你不会把这些东西送人的，对吧，欧仁妮，嗯？”","“I won’t do so again, never again,” cried her husband, “you shall see, my poor wife!”He went to his inner room and returned with a handful of louis, which he scattered on the bed.“Here, Eugenie! See, wife! All these are for you,” he said, fingering the coins.“Come, be happy, wife! Feel better, get well; you sha’n’t want for anything, nor Eugenie either.Here’s a hundred @louis d’or@ for her.You won’t give these away, will you, Eugenie, hein?”"
"葛朗台太太和女儿面面相觑，惊呆了。","Madame Grandet and her daughter looked at each other in astonishment."
"“父亲，把您的钱拿回去吧，我们只需要您的慈爱。”","“Take back your money, father; we ask for nothing but your affection.”"
"“好吧，好吧，完全正确！”说着，他把硬币放进了口袋，“咱们就是好朋友啦！咱们今天下楼去吃晚饭，而且咱们要每天晚上都玩两个苏的摸彩。你们俩会开心的。嘿，太太？”","“Well, well, that’s right!” he said, pocketing the coins, “let’s be good friends!We will all go down to dinner today, and we’ll play loto every evening for two sous.You shall both be happy.Hey, wife?”"
"“唉！要是这能让你高兴，我倒是巴不得，”奄奄一息的女人说道，“可我起不了床。”","“Alas! I wish I could, if it would give you pleasure,” said the dying woman, “but I cannot rise from my bed.”"
"“可怜的孩子她妈，”葛朗台说，“你不知道我有多爱你！还有你，我的女儿！”他搂住女儿，吻了吻。“哦，生完气再吻女儿可真好！瞧，孩子她妈，你没看见现在一切都过去了吗？去把那东西收拾起来，欧仁妮，”他指指箱子，又说道，“去吧，别怕！我以后再也不会提它了，永远不会！”","“Poor mother,” said Grandet, “you don’t know how I love you! And you too, my daughter!”He took her in his arms and kissed her.“Oh, how good it is to kiss a daughter when we have been angry with her!There, mother, don’t you see it’s all over now?Go and put that away, Eugenie,” he added, pointing to the case.“Go, don’t be afraid!I shall never speak of it again, never!”"
"贝日冷先生很快就到了，他是索米尔有名的医生。检查完之后，他语气肯定地告诉葛朗台，他妻子病得很厉害；但是心境平和、饮食得当，再加上精心的照料，可能会让她活到秋天。","Monsieur Bergerin, the celebrated doctor of Saumur, presently arrived.After an examination, he told Grandet positively that his wife was very ill; but that perfect peace of mind, a generous diet, and great care might prolong her life until the autumn."
"“那会花很多钱吗？”老头说，“她需要吃药吗？”","“Will all that cost much?” said the old man.“Will she need medicines?”"
"“药不用多吃，但是要多加照顾。”医生忍不住微微一笑，回答道。","“Not much medicine, but a great deal of care,” answered the doctor, who could scarcely restrain a smile."
"“喏，贝日冷先生，”葛朗台说，“您是个正直的人，是不是？我信得过您！您觉得怎样做合适，什么时候该来看我的太太，就只管来吧。救救我的好太太！我爱她——您没看到吗？——尽管我嘴上从来不说，但我心里一直这样想。我很苦恼。从我兄弟死时，麻烦就开始了，我不得不为他在巴黎的事花大笔大笔的钱。唉，我可是花了很多钱了，这还没完呢。再见，先生！如果您能救我的太太，就救救她吧。我会不惜一切代价的，哪怕花上我一二百法郎都行。”","“Now, Monsieur Bergerin,” said Grandet, “you are a man of honor, are not you?I trust to you!Come and see my wife how and when you think necessary.Save my good wife!I love her,—don’t you see?—though I never talk about it; I keep things to myself.I’m full of trouble.Troubles began when my brother died; I have to spend enormous sums on his affairs in Paris.Why, I’m paying through my nose; there’s no end to it.Adieu, monsieur!If you can save my wife, save her.I’ll spare no expense, not even if it costs me a hundred or two hundred francs.”"
"尽管葛朗台强烈地盼望他的妻子能康复，妻子的死对他的威胁远远不止死亡那么简单；尽管他对受宠若惊的母女俩百依百顺；尽管欧仁妮竭尽全力去悉心照料她的母亲——葛朗台太太还是很快走到了生命的尽头。她一天比一天虚弱，明显地越来越憔悴，像她这个年纪的女人，在患了重病之后，往往都会如此。她脆弱得就像秋天的叶子，天国的光辉照在她的身上，仿佛太阳照射着枯萎的叶子，给它们镀上了金光。她的死无愧于她的一生——这是一个基督徒的死，很崇高，不是吗？一八二二年十月，她的美德、她天使般的耐心、她对女儿的爱似乎都表现得格外显著；然后她就离开了人世，没有一句怨言。好像白璧无瑕的羔羊，她去了天国，唯一割舍不下的，就是她凄凉惨淡的人生中那个温柔的伴侣，她最后看女儿的那一眼，仿佛是预言了女儿充满苦难的命运。想到要把和自己一样洁白的小羊羔独自留在一个自私自利的世界中，那世界就是要剥掉她的羊毛，抢走她的财宝，她便瑟瑟发抖。","In spite of Grandet’s fervent wishes for the health of his wife, whose death threatened more than death to him; in spite of the consideration he now showed on all occasions for the least wish of his astonished wife and daughter; in spite of the tender care which Eugenie lavished upon her mother,—Madame Grandet rapidly approached her end.Every day she grew weaker and wasted visibly, as women of her age when attacked by serious illness are wont to do.She was fragile as the foliage in autumn; the radiance of heaven shone through her as the sun strikes athwart the withering leaves and gilds them.It was a death worthy of her life,—a Christian death; and is not that sublime?In the month of October, 1822, her virtues, her angelic patience, her love for her daughter, seemed to find special expression; and then she passed away without a murmur.Lamb without spot, she went to heaven, regretting only the sweet companion of her cold and dreary life, for whom her last glance seemed to prophesy a destiny of sorrows.She shrank from leaving her ewe-lamb, white as herself, alone in the midst of a selfish world that sought to strip her of her fleece and grasp her treasures."
"“我的孩子，”她咽气时说道，“只有天国才有幸福，你总有一天会知道的。”","“My child,” she said as she expired, “there is no happiness except in heaven; you will know it some day.”"
"第十二章","Chapter XII "
"母亲死后第二天，欧仁妮觉得有了一个新的理由让她眷恋这个宅子，她在这里出生，在这里经受了这么多痛苦，而且她母亲刚刚在这里去世。一看见那扇窗子和装有小脚轮的椅子，她就不禁落泪。当发现老父亲对自己关怀备至时，她想过去是误解了父亲的心思。他早上过来扶着她去吃早餐；他一连几个小时看着她，目光几乎可算是慈祥的；他不离她的左右，仿佛她是金子一般。老头判若两人，他时常在女儿跟前发抖，所以娜农和克吕绍派的人在目睹了他的老态之后，把这归结于他年事已高，并担心他的身体的机能正在退化。但是在家里办丧事的那天，克吕绍公证人（唯一知道他秘密的人）应邀在座，晚饭后，老守财奴的行为得到了解释。","On the morrow of this death Eugenie felt a new motive for attachment to the house in which she was born, where she had suffered so much, where her mother had just died.She could not see the window and the chair on its castors without weeping.She thought she had mistaken the heart of her old father when she found herself the object of his tenderest cares.He came in the morning and gave her his arm to take her to breakfast; he looked at her for hours together with an eye that was almost kind; he brooded over her as though she had been gold.The old man was so unlike himself, he trembled so often before his daughter, that Nanon and the Cruchotines, who witnessed his weakness, attributed it to his great age, and feared that his faculties were giving away.But the day on which the family put on their mourning, and after dinner, to which meal Maitre Cruchot (the only person who knew his secret) had been invited, the conduct of the old miser was explained."
"“我亲爱的孩子，”等饭桌收拾完，门也被小心地关上以后，他对欧仁妮说，“你现在是你母亲的继承人，我们之间有些小事要处理一下。是不是，克吕绍？”","“My dear child,” he said to Eugenie when the table had been cleared and the doors carefully shut, “you are now your mother’s heiress, and we have a few little matters to settle between us.Isn’t that so, Cruchot?”"
"“是的。”","“Yes.”"
"“非要今天谈那些事吗，父亲？”","“Is it necessary to talk of them today, father?”"
"“是的，是的，小乖乖，我受不了这没着没落的处境。我想，你不想让我痛苦吧？”","“Yes, yes, little one; I can’t bear the uncertainty in which I’m placed.I think you don’t want to give me pain?”"
"“哦！父亲——”","“Oh! Father—” "
"“那好！咱们今晚就把所有事都解决了吧。”","“Well, then! Let us settle it all tonight.”"
"“您想让我做什么？”","“What is it you wish me to do?”"
"“我的小姑娘，这不该由我来说。告诉她，克吕绍。”","“My little girl, it is not for me to say.Tell her, Cruchot.”"
"“小姐，你父亲不愿分割财产，也不愿卖掉产业，更不愿意因他拥有的现款而缴纳巨额的税费。因此，为了避免上述情形，他只能不对他所有的财产进行登记造册，这其中一部分是你从你母亲那里继承的，而现在你和你父亲之间还没有进行分割——”","“Mademoiselle, your father does not wish to divide the property, nor sell the estate, nor pay enormous taxes on the ready money which he may possess.Therefore, to avoid all this, he must be released from making the inventory of his whole fortune, part of which you inherit from your mother, and which is now undivided between you and your father—” "
"“克吕绍，你在跟一个还是孩子的人讲话之前，对你要说的话很有把握吗？”","“Cruchot, are you quite sure of what you are saying before you tell it to a mere child?”"
"“让我按我自己的方式来讲吧，葛朗台。”","“Let me tell it my own way, Grandet.”"
"“好的，好的，我的朋友。不管是你，还是我女儿，都不想抢劫我——是吧，小乖乖？”","“Yes, yes, my friend.Neither you nor my daughter wish to rob me,—do you, little one?”"
"“不过，克吕绍先生，我该做什么呢？”欧仁妮不耐烦地说道。","“But, Monsieur Cruchot, what am I to do?” said Eugenie impatiently."
"“好的，”公证人说，“你必须在这张契约上签字，声明放弃对你母亲遗产的继承权，在你父亲的有生之年，将你们未进行分割的全部财产交给他使用和配置，他保证你的资产净值。”","“Well,” said the notary, “it is necessary to sign this deed, by which you renounce your rights to your mother’s estate and leave your father the use and disposition, during his lifetime, of all the property undivided between you, of which he guarantees you the capital.”"
"“您说的话，我一句也听不懂，”欧仁妮回答道，“给我契约，告诉我在哪里签字。”","“I do not understand a word of what you are saying,” returned Eugenie, “give me the deed, and show me where I am to sign it.”"
"葛朗台老头看看契约，又看看女儿，看了女儿，又看看契约，这么看了个来回，在这期间，他心里激动得厉害，便擦了擦脑门上淌下的汗。","Pere Grandet looked alternately at the deed and at his daughter, at his daughter and at the deed, undergoing as he did so such violent emotion that he wiped the sweat from his brow."
"“我的小姑娘，”他说，“契约归档会花很多钱的，如果你不签这份契约，只是同意放弃对你那亲爱的已故母亲的遗产继承权，并将你的前途托付给我，我会更满意的。那样的话，我就每月给你至少整整一百法郎。看看，这下子，你要给谁做弥撒，做多少次都付得起了——嗯！一个月一百法郎——按里弗赫给？”","“My little girl,” he said, “if, instead of signing this deed, which will cost a great deal to record, you would simply agree to renounce your rights as heir to your poor dear, deceased mother’s property, and would trust to me for the future, I should like it better.In that case I will pay you monthly the good round sum of a hundred francs.See, now, you could pay for as many masses as you want for anybody—Hein! A hundred francs a month—in @livres@?”"
"“我全按您的意愿办，父亲。”","“I will do all you wish, father.”"
"“小姐，”公证人说，“我有责任向你说明，你会一无所有，没有任何保障——”","“Mademoiselle,” said the notary, “it is my duty to point out to you that you are despoiling yourself without guarantee—” "
"“天哪！那跟我有什么关系？”","“Good heavens! What is all that to me?”"
"“闭上你的嘴，克吕绍！一言为定，就这么定了。”葛朗台一边喊着，一边抓住他女儿的手，用自己的手拍着，“欧仁妮，你不会出尔反尔的？——你是个诚实的姑娘，嗯？”","“Hold your tongue, Cruchot!It’s settled, all settled,” cried Grandet, taking his daughter’s hand and striking it with his own.“Eugenie, you won’t go back on your word?—you are an honest girl, hein?”"
"“哦！父亲！——”","“Oh! Father!—” "
"他热情地吻了她一下，把她搂得紧紧的，弄得她几乎喘不过气来。","He kissed her effusively, and pressed her in his arms till he almost choked her."
"“走，我的好孩子，你救了你父亲一命；不过，你只是把他给你的东西还给了他：我们两清了。买卖就应该这样做。人生就是笔买卖。我祝福你！你是个品德高尚的姑娘，你是爱你父亲的。以后你想做什么就做什么。明天，克吕绍，”他看着惊骇不已的公证人，补充道，“你要着手准备做欧仁妮放弃继承权的契约，然后交到法庭归档。”","“Go, my good child, you restore your father’s life; but you only return to him that which he gave you: we are quits.This is how business should be done.Life is a business.I bless you! You are a virtuous girl, and you love your father.Do just what you like in future.Tomorrow, Cruchot,” he added, looking at the horrified notary, “you will see about preparing the deed of relinquishment, and then enter it on the records of the court.”"
"第二天早上，欧仁妮在契约上签了字，完成了弃权声明。尽管有协议，老头曾正经八百地起誓要给女儿一百法郎，然而，第一年年底，他连一个子儿都没给她。当欧仁妮和和气气地提醒他这件事时，他禁不住红了脸，急忙去了他的密室，拿下来大约三分之一从侄子那里搞到的珠宝，给了她。","The next morning Eugenie signed the papers by which she herself completed her spoliation.At the end of the first year, however, in spite of his bargain, the old man had not given his daughter one sou of the hundred francs he had so solemnly pledged to her.When Eugenie pleasantly reminded him of this, he could not help coloring, and went hastily to his secret hiding-place, from whence he brought down about a third of the jewels he had taken from his nephew, and gave them to her."
"“瞧，小乖乖，”他用挖苦的语调说道，“你想不想用这些东西来抵你那一千二百法郎？”","“There, little one,” he said in a sarcastic tone, “do you want those for your twelve hundred francs?”"
"“哦！父亲，真的吗？您真的要把它们给了我？”","“Oh! Father, truly? Will you really give them to me?”"
"“我明年再多给你点儿，”说着，他把那些东西扔进了她的围裙，“这样，用不了多久，你就会把他的所有玩意儿都拿到手了。”他一边补充道，一边搓着手，很高兴能利用女儿的感情占到便宜。","“I’ll give you as many more next year,” he said, throwing them into her apron.“So before long you’ll get all his gewgaws,” he added, rubbing his hands, delighted to be able to speculate on his daughter’s feelings."
"可是，老头尽管身体还结实，但还是觉得有必要把他节俭持家的秘诀传授给女儿。连着两年，他让女儿当着他的面安排家里的饭菜，并让她收取租金。他慢慢地、逐一地把他的葡萄园和农庄的名称以及收益能力都教给了她。大约第三年，他已经让她完全适应了他的贪婪作风，贪婪已经变成她固定的生活习惯，于是他总算可以放心地把家里的钥匙交给她掌管，让她当家了。","Nevertheless, the old man, though still robust, felt the importance of initiating his daughter into the secrets of his thrift and its management.For two consecutive years he made her order the household meals in his presence and receive the rents, and he taught her slowly and successively the names and remunerative capacity of his vineyards and his farms.About the third year he had so thoroughly accustomed her to his avaricious methods that they had turned into the settled habits of her own life, and he was able to leave the household keys in her charge without anxiety, and to install her as mistress of the house."
"五年过去了，没有发生一件能让欧仁妮和她父亲的单调生活有所调剂的事情。他们每天总是做同样的事情，就像钟一样机械规律。葛朗台小姐深切的愁苦人尽皆知；可是虽然别人都在推测其中的原因，她自己却从不吐露一个字，让索米尔上上下下对这位富家女的内心感受所作的种种猜测有所证实。与她交往的只有三位克吕绍和几个他们逐渐引荐到葛朗台家的朋友。他们教她打惠斯特牌，而且他们每晚都要来玩一玩。一八二七年这一年，她父亲感到自己已虚弱不堪，不得不让她更进一步地了解他那些不动产的秘密，并且告诉她，但凡有了困难，可以向克吕绍公证人求助，克吕绍的忠实可靠，他是非常了解的。","Five years passed away without a single event to relieve the monotonous existence of Eugenie and her father.The same actions were performed daily with the automatic regularity of clockwork.The deep sadness of Mademoiselle Grandet was known to every one; but if others surmised the cause, she herself never uttered a word that justified the suspicions which all Saumur entertained about the state of the rich heiress’s heart.Her only society was made up of the three Cruchots and a few of their particular friends whom they had, little by little, introduced into the Grandet household.They had taught her to play whist, and they came every night for their game.During the year 1827 her father, feeling the weight of his infirmities, was obliged to initiate her still further into the secrets of his landed property, and told her that in case of difficulty she was to have recourse to Maitre Cruchot, whose integrity was well known to him."
"将近这一年年底时，老头那时已八十二岁，他得了瘫痪症，病情迅速恶化。贝日冷医生对他放弃了医治。欧仁妮想到自己将要独自留在人世，便好像离父亲更亲近了，把这份尚存的亲情的最后一环握得更紧了。在她看来，爱就是生命的全部，在这点上，所有恋爱中的都女人一样。夏尔不在身边，她就把全部的体贴和关心都放在了老父亲的身上，老父亲的身体机能已经开始衰退，尽管他的贪婪吝啬仍旧本能地十分强烈。这个男人的死和他的生没有显出什么差别。早上，他让她们把他推到他卧室的壁炉和密室的门中间的一个地方。毫无疑问，密室里堆满了金子。他对听到的任何声响，哪怕是最轻微的，都要问个明白；让公证人大为惊讶的是，他甚至连看门狗在院子里打呵欠都听得见。每当到了租金到期、跟葡萄园艺工结账，或是开收据的日子和时刻，他就会从貌似昏迷的状态中清醒过来。这时候，他便会推动带有小脚轮的椅子，来到密室的门前。他让女儿打开门，看着她把一袋又一袋的钱放进他秘密的储藏室里，然后再锁好门。接着，等把钥匙给了他之后，她就默默地回到自己的座位上，而他则把钥匙放回他的马甲口袋里，还不时地用手摸摸。他的老朋友公证人确信，假如夏尔·葛朗台不回来，这个富有的女继承人肯定会嫁给他的庭长侄子的，于是他就变得倍加殷勤；他每天都来听葛朗台的吩咐，去弗罗瓦丰、农庄、草场和葡萄园替他办差，把葡萄收成卖掉，将一切所得换成金银，再装成一袋一袋，放进那个密室。","Towards the end of this year the old man, then eighty-two, was seized by paralysis, which made rapid progress.Dr. Bergerin gave him up.Eugenie, feeling that she was about to be left alone in the world, came, as it were, nearer to her father, and clasped more tightly this last living link of affection.To her mind, as in that of all loving women, love was the whole of life.Charles was not there, and she devoted all her care and attention to the old father, whose faculties had begun to weaken, though his avarice remained instinctively acute.The death of this man offered no contrast to his life.In the morning he made them roll him to a spot between the chimney of his chamber and the door of the secret room, which was filled, no doubt, with gold.He asked for an explanation of every noise he heard, even the slightest; to the great astonishment of the notary, he even heard the watchdog yawning in the courtyard.He woke up from his apparent stupor at the day and hour when the rents were due, or when accounts had to be settled with his vine-dressers, and receipts given.At such times he worked his chair forward on its castors until he faced the door of the inner room.He made his daughter open it, and watched while she placed the bags of money one upon another in his secret receptacles and relocked the door.Then she returned silently to her seat, after giving him the key, which he replaced in his waistcoat pocket and fingered from time to time.His old friend the notary, feeling sure that the rich heiress would inevitably marry his nephew the president, if Charles Grandet did not return, redoubled all his attentions; he came every day to take Grandet’s orders, went on his errands to Froidfond, to the farms and the fields and the vineyards, sold the vintages, and turned everything into gold and silver, which found their way in sacks to the secret hiding-place."
"终于，最后的挣扎来临了，老头结实的身板奄奄待毙。他决意要坐到壁炉边正对着密室房门的地方。他把身上盖的东西都拉起来，裹紧了，对娜农说，“把它们收拾好，锁起来，以免被人偷了。”","At length the last struggle came, in which the strong frame of the old man slowly yielded to destruction.He was determined to sit at the chimney-corner facing the door of the secret room.He drew off and rolled up all the coverings which were laid over him, saying to Nanon, “Put them away, lock them up, for fear they should be stolen.”"
"他的全部生命力现在都退守在双眼中，只要能够睁开眼睛，他就会把目光转向那扇后面藏着他的财宝的门，他跟女儿说：“它们在那里吗？它们在那里吗？”语调里透着一种惶恐不安。","So long as he could open his eyes, in which his whole being had now taken refuge, he turned them to the door behind which lay his treasures, saying to his daughter, “Are they there? Are they there?” in a tone of voice which revealed a sort of panic fear."
"“是的，父亲。”她会回答道。","“Yes, my father,” she would answer."
"“看好金子——把金子放到我面前。”","“Take care of the gold—put gold before me.”"
"于是，欧仁妮就会把硬币摊放在他面前的一张桌子上，而他会一连坐上好几个小时，两眼盯着硬币，好像一个刚刚开始看的孩子一样，老是盯着同一件东西发呆，他还会像个孩子一样，脸上闪现出一丝微笑，但看起来有点儿痛苦。","Eugenie would then spread coins on a table before him, and he would sit for hours together with his eyes fixed upon them, like a child who, at the moment it first begins to see, gazes in stupid contemplation at the same object, and like the child, a distressful smile would flicker upon his face."
"有时他会说：“这东西让我觉得暖和！”这时他的脸上就掠过一种无比幸福的表情。","“It warms me!” he would sometimes say, as an expression of beatitude stole across his features."
"当教区的神父来主持临终圣礼时，老头那双明显已失明了几个小时的眼睛，一看见十字架、烛台和银圣水壶，就放出了光；他目不转睛地盯着那些东西，他的肉瘤动了最后一次。当神父把镀银的十字架放到他的唇边，让他亲吻基督时，他做了一个可怕的手势，仿佛要抓住十字架，这最后一使劲要了他的命。他叫着欧仁妮，尽管她就跪在他的边上，他却看不见。欧仁妮的泪水洒落在他僵硬的手上，那手已经冰凉了。","When the cure of the parish came to administer the last sacraments, the old man’s eyes, sightless, apparently, for some hours, kindled at the sight of the cross, the candlesticks, and the holy-water vessel of silver; he gazed at them fixedly, and his wen moved for the last time.When the priest put the crucifix of silver-gilt to his lips, that he might kiss the Christ, he made a frightful gesture, as if to seize it; and that last effort cost him his life.He called Eugenie, whom he did not see, though she was kneeling beside him bathing with tears his stiffening hand, which was already cold."
"“父亲，祝福我吧！”她恳求道。","“My father, bless me!” she entreated."
"“把所有事都照管好。你要到那边给我交账！”他说道，用这最后几个字证明了基督教应该永远是守财奴的宗教。","“Take care of it all.You will render me an account yonder!” he said, proving by these last words that Christianity must always be the religion of misers."
"欧仁妮·葛朗台现在独自留在世间，住在那座灰色的宅子里，只有娜农一个人能够确定无疑地听懂她的话，并理解她——娜农是唯一为爱她而爱她的人，唯一她能与之倾诉悲痛的人。对欧仁妮来说，大个子娜农就是个守护神。她不是佣人，而是个谦卑的朋友。父亲死后，欧仁妮从克吕绍公证人那里得知，她在索米尔郡因不动产和动产而拥有三十万法郎的收入，另有以年息百分之三投资公债的六百万法郎（六十法郎买进，现在值七十六法郎），还有两百万的金币和十万法郎的克朗银币，以及日后待入的利息。","Eugenie Grandet was now alone in the world in that gray house, with none but Nanon to whom she could turn with the certainty of being heard and understood,—Nanon the sole being who loved her for herself and with whom she could speak of her sorrows.La Grande Nanon was a providence for Eugenie.She was not a servant, but a humble friend.After her father’s death Eugenie learned from Maitre Cruchot that she possessed an income of three hundred thousand francs from landed and personal property in the arrondissement of Saumur; also six millions invested at three per cent in the Funds (bought at sixty, and now worth seventy-six francs); also two millions in gold coin, and a hundred thousand francs in silver crown-pieces, besides all the interest which was still to be collected."
"她的财产总数达到了一千七百万。","The sum total of her property reached seventeen millions."
"“我的堂弟在哪里呢？”这是她心里想的一件事。","“Where is my cousin?” was her one thought."
"那天，克吕绍公证人给他的委托人送来了一份清楚准确的全部遗产的清单，欧仁妮正孤零零地和娜农坐在壁炉旁，大厅空荡荡的，如今，从她母亲曾坐过的带小脚轮的椅子，到她堂弟用过的玻璃杯，这大厅的所有东西都已成了回忆。","The day on which Maitre Cruchot handed in to his client a clear and exact schedule of the whole inheritance, Eugenie remained alone with Nanon, sitting beside the fireplace in the vacant hall, where all was now a memory, from the chair on castors which her mother had sat in, to the glass from which her cousin drank."
"“娜农，就剩下咱们了——”","“Nanon, we are alone—” "
"“是的，小姐，要是我知道他在哪里，那个宝贝，我就是走着也要找着他。”","“Yes, mademoiselle; and if I knew where he was, the darling, I’d go on foot to find him.”"
"“我们中间隔着大洋呢。”她说。","“The ocean is between us,” she said."
"这幢阴冷黑暗的房子就是可怜的女继承人的整个世界，当她在里面由老佣人陪着哭泣的时候，从南特到奥尔良，整个省都在盛传着葛朗台小姐有一千七百万的事。她做的第一件事情就是给了娜农一千二百法郎的年金，连上原先已有的六百多法郎，娜农成了一个有钱的、令人羡慕的结婚对象。不到一个月，这个好心人就由单身步入了婚姻生活，嫁给了安托万·科努瓦耶，科努瓦耶被任命为葛朗台小姐全部产业的总管。科努瓦耶太太和她的同龄人相比，有个明显的优势。她虽然五十九岁了，但看上去还不过四十岁。她粗糙的容貌经得起岁月的摧残。由于半修道院式的健康的生活习惯，凭着红润的皮肤和铁打般的体格这样的有利条件，她一点儿都不显老。也许在一生当中，她从没有像结婚那天那么好看过。她沾了生得丑陋的光，她又高、又胖、又结实，还有毫不见老的脸上一副幸福的神情，这让好多人羡慕起科努瓦耶来。","While the poor heiress wept in company of an old servant, in that cold dark house, which was to her the universe, the whole province rang, from Nantes to Orleans, with the seventeen millions of Mademoiselle Grandet.Among her first acts she had settled an annuity of twelve hundred francs on Nanon, who, already possessed of six hundred more, became a rich and enviable match.In less than a month that good soul passed from single to wedded life under the protection of Antoine Cornoiller, who was appointed keeper of all Mademoiselle Grandet’s estates.Madame Cornoiller possessed one striking advantage over her contemporaries.Although she was fifty-nine years of age, she did not look more than forty.Her strong features had resisted the ravages of time.Thanks to the healthy customs of her semi-conventual life, she laughed at old age from the vantage-ground of a rosy skin and an iron constitution.Perhaps she never looked as well in her life as she did on her marriage-day.She had all the benefits of her ugliness, and was big and fat and strong, with a look of happiness on her indestructible features which made a good many people envy Cornoiller."
"“气色真好！”卖布的说。","“Fast colors!” said the draper."
"“很能生孩子呢，”卖盐的商人说，“她简直是在卤水里腌过，恕我冒昧。”","“Quite likely to have children,” said the salt merchant.“She’s pickled in brine, saving your presence.”"
"“她有钱，科努瓦耶那小子可是给自己办了件好事。”第三个人说道。","“She is rich, and that fellow Cornoiller has done a good thing for himself,” said a third man."
"娜农在街坊四邻间人缘很好，她从老房子里出来去往教区的教堂，在走过曲曲折折的街道时，受到了很多人的祝贺。欧仁妮送给她三打银叉子和勺子作为结婚贺礼。科努瓦耶没有想到女主人竟如此慷慨，提起他的女主人便热泪盈眶，他甘愿为她粉身碎骨。科努瓦耶太太被任命为葛朗台小姐的管家，她从她的新职位中得到的快乐不亚于有了一个丈夫所得到的快乐。她负责每周的账务；她学着已故男主人的做派，把食物锁起来，再每天发放出去；她管着两个佣人——一个厨子和一个负责补衣服被褥和缝制小姐衣裙的女佣。科努瓦耶兼任看守和总管。不用说，由娜农挑来的女佣是“绝佳的珍品”。葛朗台小姐于是便有了四个忠心耿耿的佣人。佃户们在葛朗台先生死后并没有觉出有什么变化；他严格制定的规矩章程都被科努瓦耶先生和太太一丝不苟地执行着。","When she came forth from the old house on her way to the parish church, Nanon, who was loved by all the neighborhood, received many compliments as she walked down the tortuous street.Eugenie had given her three dozen silver forks and spoons as a wedding present.Cornoiller, amazed at such magnificence, spoke of his mistress with tears in his eyes; he would willingly have been hacked in pieces in her behalf.Madame Cornoiller, appointed housekeeper to Mademoiselle Grandet, got as much happiness out of her new position as she did from the possession of a husband.She took charge of the weekly accounts; she locked up the provisions and gave them out daily, after the manner of her defunct master; she ruled over two servants,—a cook, and a maid whose business it was to mend the house-linen and make mademoiselle’s dresses.Cornoiller combined the functions of keeper and bailiff.It is unnecessary to say that the women-servants selected by Nanon were “perfect treasures.”Mademoiselle Grandet thus had four servants, whose devotion was unbounded.The farmers perceived no change after Monsieur Grandet’s death; the usages and customs he had sternly established were scrupulously carried out by Monsieur and Madame Cornoiller."
"到了三十岁，欧仁妮还没有体会到人生的任何乐趣。她暗淡悲凉的童年是在一个心灵总是被误解和伤害、永远总在痛苦的母亲身边度过的。这位母亲在高高兴兴离开人世时，可怜女儿还必须得活下去；她给她孩子的心里留下了些许短暂的自责和许多永久的遗憾。欧仁妮的第一次也是仅有的一次爱情是她内心愁苦的根源。和情人相处了短短几天，她便在两次秘密的接吻中把心交给了他；后来他走了，他们中间隔着整个世界。这场被她父亲诅咒的爱情，夺走了她母亲的生命，给她带来的只有悲痛，中间夹杂着几分渺茫的希望。所以，她对幸福奋力的追求耗尽了她的力量，但没有给她任何回报。精神生活和肉体生活一样，有呼有吸；一个灵魂需要吸收另一个灵魂的情感并加以融合，才可能以更丰富的形式回报对方。要是没有人类这种美妙的现象，心灵就会没有生机；就会缺乏空气；就会遭受苦痛，然后凋亡。欧仁妮已经开始痛苦了。对她来说，财富既不是权力，也不是慰籍；她只能靠爱情、宗教和对未来的信念而活着。爱情向她阐明了永恒的秘密。她的心灵和福音书让她知道了两个世界；她日日夜夜都沉浸在两种无限的思想深处，这两种思想对她来说也许只有一个含义。她回到自己的内心世界中，爱着别人，并相信自己也被人爱着。七年来，她强烈的感情渗透进了一切当中。她的财富并不是收益不断增长的百万家产，而是夏尔的梳妆箱，是挂在她床头的那两张肖像，是从她父亲那里赎回并自豪地珍藏于橡木柜子抽屉中一层毛毡子上的首饰，还有她母亲曾一度用过的她婶婶的顶针。她一做刺绣的时候，就虔诚地戴上那只顶针——好像珀涅罗珀织布一样，仅仅是为了把那满载回忆的金器戴在她的手指上。","At thirty years of age Eugenie knew none of the joys of life.Her pale, sad childhood had glided on beside a mother whose heart, always misunderstood and wounded, had known only suffering.Leaving this life joyfully, the mother pitied the daughter because she still must live; and she left in her child’s soul some fugitive remorse and many lasting regrets.Eugenie’s first and only love was a wellspring of sadness within her.Meeting her lover for a few brief days, she had given him her heart between two kisses furtively exchanged; then he had left her, and a whole world lay between them.This love, cursed by her father, had cost the life of her mother and brought her only sorrow, mingled with a few frail hopes.Thus her upward spring towards happiness had wasted her strength and given her nothing in exchange for it.In the life of the soul, as in the physical life, there is an inspiration and a respiration; the soul needs to absorb the sentiments of another soul and assimilate them, that it may render them back enriched.Were it not for this glorious human phenomenon, there would be no life for the heart; air would be wanting; it would suffer, and then perish.Eugenie had begun to suffer.For her, wealth was neither a power nor a consolation; she could not live except through love, through religion, through faith in the future.Love explained to her the mysteries of eternity.Her heart and the Gospel taught her to know two worlds; she bathed, night and day, in the depths of two infinite thoughts, which for her may have had but one meaning.She drew back within herself, loving, and believing herself beloved.For seven years her passion had invaded everything.Her treasuries were not the millions whose revenues were rolling up; they were Charles’s dressing-case, the portraits hanging above her bed, the jewels recovered from her father and proudly spread upon a bed of wool in a drawer of the oaken cabinet, the thimble of her aunt, used for a while by her mother, which she wore religiously as she worked at a piece of embroidery,—a Penelope’s web, begun for the sole purpose of putting upon her finger that gold so rich in memories."
"看来葛朗台小姐是不大可能在服丧期间结婚的。她真挚的虔诚之心人尽皆知。结果，克吕绍一家在老神父的高明筹划下，暂时心满意足地围绕在这位有钱的女继承人左右，并给予她最殷勤的照顾。每天晚上，大厅里满是克吕绍家忠诚的拥趸，他们用各种声调对女主人大唱赞歌。她有常任的侍医，有大司祭，有内侍，有梳妆女官，有首相；最重要的是，她有总理大臣，一个乐意对她大胆进言的大臣。如果这位女继承人想要个挽裙裾的人，她立刻就能找出一位来。她俨然是个女王，被人谄媚阿谀。阿谀奉承从不会出自高贵的灵魂，它是小人的伎俩，那些小人卑躬屈膝，千方百计接近他们要趋炎附势的大人物。阿谀奉承意在为自己谋利。所以，那些每天晚上聚集在葛朗台小姐家（他们称她为德弗罗瓦丰小姐）的人在赞美之词上相互争胜。这番异口同声的赞颂，欧仁妮以前从来没有领受过，初听时她还脸红；可是不知不觉地，她的耳朵听惯了这种声音，不管这些赞美之词是多么刺耳，她很快就适应了听别人称赞她的美貌，如果有某个新来的人好像有认为她丑陋的意思，她会觉得极为羞辱，程度远胜于八年前。她最终喜欢上了恭维话，那是她从前暗中对她膜拜的偶像说的。渐渐地，她习惯了被人捧得像个君主的生活，习惯了看着她的上下朝臣每晚紧紧地围着她转。","It seemed unlikely that Mademoiselle Grandet would marry during the period of her mourning.Her genuine piety was well known.Consequently the Cruchots, whose policy was sagely guided by the old abbe, contented themselves for the time being with surrounding the great heiress and paying her the most affectionate attentions.Every evening the hall was filled with a party of devoted Cruchotines, who sang the praises of its mistress in every key.She had her doctor in ordinary, her grand almoner, her chamberlain, her first lady of honor, her prime minister; above all, her chancellor, a chancellor who would fain have said much to her.If the heiress had wished for a train-bearer, one would instantly have been found.She was a queen, obsequiously flattered.Flattery never emanates from noble souls; it is the gift of little minds, who thus still further belittle themselves to worm their way into the vital being of the persons around whom they crawl.Flattery means self-interest.So the people who, night after night, assembled in Mademoiselle Grandet’s house (they called her Mademoiselle de Froidfond) outdid each other in expressions of admiration.This concert of praise, never before bestowed upon Eugenie, made her blush under its novelty; but insensibly her ear became habituated to the sound, and however coarse the compliments might be, she soon was so accustomed to hear her beauty lauded that if any new-comer had seemed to think her plain, she would have felt the reproach far more than she might have done eight years earlier.She ended at last by loving the incense, which she secretly laid at the feet of her idol.By degrees she grew accustomed to be treated as a sovereign and to see her court pressing around her every evening."
"德蓬丰先生是这个小圈子的男主角，他的风趣、他的人品、他的学问和他的和蔼可亲在这个圈子里不断受到赞扬。有人说，七年来，他的财富已大大增加，蓬丰那块产业每年至少能带来一万法郎的收入，而且和克吕绍家的其他财产一样，四周都是那位女继承人的广阔地产。","Monsieur de Bonfons was the hero of the little circle, where his wit, his person, his education, his amiability, were perpetually praised.One or another would remark that in seven years he had largely increased his fortune, that Bonfons brought in at least ten thousand francs a year, and was surrounded, like the other possessions of the Cruchots, by the vast domains of the heiress."
"“你知道吗，小姐，”一个常客说道，“克吕绍家有四万法郎的收入！”","“Do you know, mademoiselle,” said an habitual visitor, “that the Cruchots have an income of forty thousand francs among them!”"
"“还有他们的积蓄！”克吕绍派一个名叫德格里博古的老妇人大声喊道。","“And then, their savings!” exclaimed an elderly female Cruchotine, Mademoiselle de Gribeaucourt."
"“一位巴黎来的先生最近出价二十万法郎要把事务所盘给克吕绍先生，”另一个人说道，“他如果被任命为治安法官，就会把事务所盘出去。”","“A gentleman from Paris has lately offered Monsieur Cruchot two hundred thousand francs for his practice,” said another.“He will sell it if he is appointed @juge de paix@.”"
"“他想接替德蓬丰先生当民事法庭的庭长，正在采取措施，”多尔松瓦太太回应道，“庭长先生肯定会被选为政务委员的。”","“He wants to succeed Monsieur de Bonfons as president of the civil courts, and is taking measures,” replied Madame d’Orsonval.“Monsieur le president will certainly be made councillor.”"
"“是的，他是个非常出色的人才，”另一位说道，“您不这样认为吗，小姐？”","“Yes, he is a very distinguished man,” said another,“don’t you think so, mademoiselle?”"
"德蓬丰先生竭力要和自己想扮演的角色般配起来。虽然年已四十，而且面色黝黑、相貌可憎，跟多数司法人员一样长着一张干瘪的脸，他却穿得年轻时髦，舞弄着一根竹子手杖。他在德弗罗瓦丰小姐府上从不吸鼻烟，来时总系一条白领带，穿一件衬衣，衬衣上的褶皱饰边让他看上去像是跟火鸡同族。他跟美丽的女继承人说话时，态度亲昵，称她为“我们亲爱的欧仁妮”。总之，除了客人的数目，除了摸彩变成了惠斯特牌，除了葛朗台先生和太太的缺席，那场面和这段历史开头的情景差不多完全一样。那群猎犬仍在追逐欧仁妮和她的百万家产；可是猎犬的数量越多，嗅觉越灵敏，包围起猎物来也更加团结。要是夏尔从西印度群岛跑回来，他会发现还是同样的人和同样的利益。欧仁妮对德格拉桑太太非常友好，非常谦恭，德格拉桑太太仍然在不断地折磨克吕绍家。和从前一样，欧仁妮是画面的中心人物，而夏尔也像过去一样，仍旧还是所有人的领袖。不过，倒是还有一些进步。庭长以前每逢欧仁妮生日和命名日才给她送鲜花，而现在，鲜花已成了每天的定例。每天晚上，他都给富有的女继承人送来一大束富丽堂皇的鲜花，科努瓦耶太太总是当众把它插入花瓶，等客人离开后，就偷偷扔到院子的一个角落。","Monsieur de Bonfons endeavored to put himself in keeping with the role he sought to play.In spite of his forty years, in spite of his dusky and crabbed features, withered like most judicial faces, he dressed in youthful fashions, toyed with a bamboo cane, never took snuff in Mademoiselle de Froidfond’s house, and came in a white cravat and a shirt whose pleated frill gave him a family resemblance to the race of turkeys.He addressed the beautiful heiress familiarly, and spoke of her as “Our dear Eugenie.”In short, except for the number of visitors, the change from lotto to whist, and the disappearance of Monsieur and Madame Grandet, the scene was about the same as the one with which this history opened.The pack were still pursuing Eugenie and her millions; but the hounds, more in number, lay better on the scent, and beset the prey more unitedly.If Charles could have dropped from the Indian Isles, he would have found the same people and the same interests.Madame des Grassins, to whom Eugenie was full of kindness and courtesy, still persisted in tormenting the Cruchots.Eugenie, as in former days, was the central figure of the picture; and Charles, as heretofore, would still have been the sovereign of all.Yet there had been some progress.The flowers which the president formerly presented to Eugenie on her birthdays and fete-days had now become a daily institution.Every evening he brought the rich heiress a huge and magnificent bouquet, which Madame Cornoiller placed conspicuously in a vase, and secretly threw into a corner of the courtyard when the visitors had departed."
"初春时，德格拉桑太太不想让克吕绍派过得太安生，就跟欧仁妮谈起德弗罗瓦丰侯爵，如果女继承人和他结了婚，把他原先的田产给他带回去，那他可能会重振早先破产的家业。德格拉桑太太翻来复去地讲着侯爵夫人的贵族爵位和头衔，当把欧仁妮轻蔑的微笑误以为是默许后，她便到处扬言说，欧仁妮跟“克吕绍先生”的婚姻远不像人们想的那样确定。","Early in the spring, Madame des Grassins attempted to trouble the peace of the Cruchotines by talking to Eugenie of the Marquis de Froidfond, whose ancient and ruined family might be restored if the heiress would give him back his estates through marriage.Madame des Grassins rang the changes on the peerage and the title of marquise, until, mistaking Eugenie’s disdainful smile for acquiescence, she went about proclaiming that the marriage with “Monsieur Cruchot” was not nearly as certain as people thought."
"“尽管德弗罗瓦丰先生五十岁了，”她说，“但他看上去没有克吕绍先生老。他是个鳏夫，有孩子，那倒是真的。不过他可是个侯爵，将来是法国的贵族院议员，这年头，你到哪里能找到比这更好的亲事呀？我确确实实知道，葛朗台老头在把所有钱投进弗罗瓦丰的时候，就是打算跟这个家族结亲的，他经常跟我说起这个。他是个狡猾的家伙，那个老头子！”","“Though Monsieur de Froidfond is fifty,” she said, “he does not look older than Monsieur Cruchot.He is a widower, and he has children, that’s true.But then he is a marquis; he will be peer of France; and in times like these where you will find a better match?I know it for a fact that Pere Grandet, when he put all his money into Froidfond, intended to graft himself upon that stock; he often told me so.He was a deep one, that old man!”"
"“啊！娜农，”一天晚上临睡觉时，欧仁妮说道，“都七年了，他怎么从没给我写过一封信？”","“Ah! Nanon,” said Eugenie, one night as she was going to bed, “how is it that in seven years he has never once written to me?”"
"第十三章","Chapter XIII "
"在索米尔发生这些事件的时候，夏尔在西印度群岛发了财。他的那批货卖得很好。他一开始就挣到了六千美元。一过赤道，他便丢掉了脑子里许多陈腐的观念；他发现，和欧洲一样，热带地区最好的发财办法是买卖人口。他去非洲海岸买了一些黑人，在贩卖人口的同时，他还贩运其他一些同样有利可图的货物。他把全部精力投入到生意当中，没有片刻闲暇。他一心想发了大财，好风风光光地重返巴黎，并希望重新获得一个比他落魄前还要显耀的地位。","While these events were happening in Saumur, Charles was making his fortune in the Indies.His commercial outfit had sold well.He began by realizing a sum of six thousand dollars.Crossing the line had brushed a good many cobwebs out of his brain; he perceived that the best means of attaining fortune in tropical regions, as well as in Europe, was to buy and sell men.He went to the coast of Africa and bought Negroes, combining his traffic in human flesh with that of other merchandise equally advantageous to his interests.He carried into this business an activity which left him not a moment of leisure.He was governed by the desire of reappearing in Paris with all the prestige of a large fortune, and by the hope of regaining a position even more brilliant than the one from which he had fallen."
"由于在人堆里混，在多个地方跑，还见识了各种迥异的风俗，他的观念改变了，变得爱猜疑了。他不再有一成不变的是非原则，因为他看到在一个国家被称为犯罪的事情，在另一个国家却被赞为美德。在为谋私利不断进行的搏斗中，他的心变冷酷了，然后又变得狭小，再后来就干枯了。葛朗台家族的血统没有失传；夏尔变得冷酷无情、贪得无厌。他贩卖中国人、黑人、燕窝、儿童和艺人；他大范围地放高利贷；他惯于欺诈海关，这很快就让他不怎么把人权当回事了。他到圣托马斯岛贱价收购海盗掠取的货物，然后再运到能卖个好价钱的港口。如果说在他初次出海时，他还想着欧仁妮纯洁而高贵的面容，就像西班牙水手把圣母像挂在桅杆上一样，如果说他把开始的成功还归功于他温柔的情人所做的祈祷和祝福的魔力上，那后来，他到处跟其他各种女人——黑人、穆拉托人、白人和印度舞女——花天酒地、放浪形骸，便把他对堂姐、索米尔、那座宅子、长凳和黑暗过道里的匆匆一吻这所有的回忆都抹得一干二净了。","By dint of jostling with men, travelling through many lands, and studying a variety of conflicting customs, his ideas had been modified and had become sceptical.He ceased to have fixed principles of right and wrong, for he saw what was called a crime in one country lauded as a virtue in another.In the perpetual struggle of selfish interests his heart grew cold, then contracted, and then dried up.The blood of the Grandets did not fail of its destiny; Charles became hard, and eager for prey.He sold Chinamen, Negroes, birds’ nests, children, artists; he practised usury on a large scale; the habit of defrauding custom-houses soon made him less scrupulous about the rights of his fellow men.He went to the Island of St. Thomas and bought, for a mere song, merchandise that had been captured by pirates, and took it to ports where he could sell it at a good price.If the pure and noble face of Eugenie went with him on his first voyage, like that image of the Virgin which Spanish mariners fastened to their masts, if he attributed his first success to the magic influence of the prayers and intercessions of his gentle love, later on women of other kinds,—blacks, mulattoes, whites, and Indian dancing-girls,—orgies and adventures in many lands, completely effaced all recollection of his cousin, of Saumur, of the house, the bench, the kiss snatched in the dark passage."
"他只记得围在破旧墙垣里的小花园，因为正是在那里，他得知了突如其来的命运；但是他拒绝一切跟他的家族有关联的东西。他的伯父是只老狗，偷走了他的首饰；欧仁妮不管是在他的心里，还是在他的思想上都没有地位，尽管在他的账目里，她确实占着个六千法郎的债主的位置。","He remembered only the little garden shut in with crumbling walls, for it was there he learned the fate that had overtaken him; but he rejected all connection with his family.His uncle was an old dog who had filched his jewels; Eugenie had no place in his heart nor in his thoughts, though she did have a place in his accounts as a creditor for the sum of six thousand francs."
"这种行为和这些想法便是夏尔·葛朗台杳无音信的原因。在西印度群岛、圣托马斯、非洲海岸、里斯本和美国，这个投机家取了个假名字——谢泼德，这样就不会连累他的本姓了。夏尔·谢泼德可以毫无风险、不知疲倦地大胆捞钱，贪图利益了，就像一个人决心不择手段地狠捞一把，以便早日金盆洗手，好在余生里做得像个正人君子。","Such conduct and such ideas explain Charles Grandet’s silence.In the Indies, at St. Thomas, on the coast of Africa, at Lisbon, and in the United States the adventurer had taken the pseudonym of Shepherd, that he might not compromise his own name.Charles Shepherd could safely be indefatigable, bold, grasping, and greedy of gain, like a man who resolves to snatch his fortune @quibus cumque viis@, and makes haste to have done with villainy, that he may spend the rest of his life as an honest man."
"靠这种做法，他发迹又快又显赫；一八二七年，夏尔·葛朗台乘坐一艘隶属于保王党商号的豪华双桅横帆船——“玛丽·卡罗琳”号，返回了波尔多。他随身带有价值一百九十万法郎的金砂，希望换成法币时能从中获取百分之七或百分之八的利。在船上，他遇到了一位国王查理十世陛下的御用侍从——德奥布里翁先生，这位值得尊敬的老人一时糊涂娶了个上流社会的女人，而他的财产都是在西印度群岛赚来的。为了补上德奥布里翁太太挥霍的亏空，他去西印度群岛变卖了产业，此时正和家人返回法国。","With such methods, prosperity was rapid and brilliant; and in 1827 Charles Grandet returned to Bordeaux on the “Marie Caroline,” a fine brig belonging to a royalist house of business.He brought with him nineteen hundred thousand francs worth of gold-dust, from which he expected to derive seven or eight per cent more at the Paris mint.On the brig he met a gentleman-in-ordinary to His Majesty Charles X., Monsieur d’Aubrion, a worthy old man who had committed the folly of marrying a woman of fashion with a fortune derived from the West India Islands.To meet the costs of Madame d’Aubrion’s extravagance, he had gone out to the Indies to sell the property, and was now returning with his family to France."
"德奥布里翁先生和太太是法国南部的一个家族——德奥布里翁·德比什家族的后裔，其家族最后一位领主，或者说首领，一七八九年以前就死了，他们现在家境衰落，收入大约仅为两万法郎。他们有个长相丑陋的女儿，做母亲的打算不给嫁妆就把她嫁出去——因为家里的财产只够勉强维持她在巴黎的生活需求。尽管交际场中的多数人都认为，一个交际花总是机灵过人，但他们也觉得这似乎是一番难于成功的事业；实际上，德奥布里翁太太本人每当看着自己的女儿，也差不多对她嫁人不抱任何希望了，哪怕是嫁给一个一心想跟贵族攀亲的人。德奥布里翁小姐很像跟她同名的昆虫，仿佛一个又高又瘦、又细又长的蜻蜓；她的嘴一副鄙夷的样子，上面长着个过于长的鼻子，鼻头很厚，平时是灰黄色的，可是吃过饭后，就变得非常红——当这种植物现象出现在一张苍白、沮丧而且乏味的脸上时，就会令人极为厌恶。从某种意义上说，她正是一个三十八岁，却风韵犹存、老于世故的母亲所希望的那样。不过，为了弥补女儿的个人缺陷，侯爵夫人教给了女儿一种雍容华贵的姿态，让她养成了良好的卫生习惯，使她的鼻子暂时保持着正常的肤色；她教给女儿穿着得体的技巧，使她拥有迷人的举止；向她展示做出忧郁眼神的诀窍，以打动男人，让那男人相信他已经找到了寻觅已久的天使；她还教给女儿如何抬足迈步——以便在鼻子肆无忌惮发红的时候，使纤足在裙裾下若隐若现，露出其娇小的尺寸。总之，德奥布里翁太太已经巧妙地将自己的后代精心打造了一番。","Monsieur and Madame d’Aubrion, of the house of d’Aubrion de Buch, a family of southern France, whose last @captal@, or chief, died before 1789, were now reduced to an income of about twenty thousand francs, and they possessed an ugly daughter whom the mother was resolved to marry without a @dot@,—the family fortune being scarcely sufficient for the demands of her own life in Paris.This was an enterprise whose success might have seemed problematical to most men of the world, in spite of the cleverness with which such men credit a fashionable woman; in fact, Madame d’Aubrion herself, when she looked at her daughter, almost despaired of getting rid of her to any one, even to a man craving connection with nobility.Mademoiselle d’Aubrion was a long, spare, spindling demoiselle, like her namesake the insect; her mouth was disdainful; over it hung a nose that was too long, thick at the end, sallow in its normal condition, but very red after a meal,—a sort of vegetable phenomenon which is particularly disagreeable when it appears in the middle of a pale, dull, and uninteresting face.In one sense she was all that a worldly mother, thirty-eight years of age and still a beauty with claims to admiration, could have wished.However, to counterbalance her personal defects, the marquise gave her daughter a distinguished air, subjected her to hygienic treatment which provisionally kept her nose at a reasonable flesh-tint, taught her the art of dressing well, endowed her with charming manners, showed her the trick of melancholy glances which interest a man and make him believe that he has found a long-sought angel, taught her the manoeuvre of the foot,—letting it peep beneath the petticoat, to show its tiny size, at the moment when the nose became aggressively red; in short, Madame d’Aubrion had cleverly made the very best of her offspring."
"凭借宽大的袖子、掩人耳目的衬垫、裁剪宽松的蓬蓬长裙，还有紧绷绷的紧身胸衣，她居然拥有了一些精致的女性特点，简直应该把它们都放到博物馆中去展览，以供母亲们借鉴。","By means of full sleeves, deceptive pads, puffed dresses amply trimmed, and high-pressure corsets, she had obtained such curious feminine developments that she ought, for the instruction of mothers, to have exhibited them in a museum."
"夏尔之所以跟德奥布里翁太太套近乎，正是因为这位太太很想跟他接近。船上的人声称，美丽的德奥布里翁太太用尽了所有手段来俘虏这个有钱的女婿。一八二七年六月，在波尔多下船时，德奥布里翁先生、太太、小姐，和夏尔住进了同一家旅店，并一起动身去往巴黎。德奥布里翁府邸早已被抵押出去，指定夏尔去赎回来。那位母亲告诉他，把底楼让给当女婿的住，她会有多么高兴。她不像德奥布里翁先生那样对贵族门第怀有偏见，她答应夏尔·葛朗台，要向查理十世请道御旨，恩准他——葛朗台改姓德奥布里翁，并使用德奥布里翁的爵徽，而且只要一年出三万六千法郎，就能购买下限嗣继承的不动产，承袭德比什领主和德奥布里翁侯爵的头衔。这样，通过将他们的财产合并起来，相互处得又融洽，再加上白拿的俸禄，两家人就可以住在德奥布里翁府邸，拥有超过十几万法郎的收入。","Charles became very intimate with Madame d’Aubrion precisely because she was desirous of becoming intimate with him.Persons who were on board the brig declared that the handsome Madame d’Aubrion neglected no means of capturing so rich a son-in-law.On landing at Bordeaux in June, 1827, Monsieur, Madame, Mademoiselle d’Aubrion, and Charles lodged at the same hotel and started together for Paris.The hotel d’Aubrion was hampered with mortgages; Charles was destined to free it.The mother told him how delighted she would be to give up the ground-floor to a son-in-law.Not sharing Monsieur d’Aubrion’s prejudices on the score of nobility, she promised Charles Grandet to obtain a royal ordinance from Charles X. which would authorize him, Grandet, to take the name and arms of d’Aubrion and to succeed, by purchasing the entailed estate for thirty-six thousand francs a year, to the titles of Captal de Buch and Marquis d’Aubrion.By thus uniting their fortunes, living on good terms, and profiting by sinecures, the two families might occupy the hotel d’Aubrion with an income of over a hundred thousand francs."
"“等一个人一年有了十万法郎，有了姓氏，有了门第，有了宫廷职位——因为我会让你当个王室侍从的——他就可以做他喜欢做的事了，”她对夏尔说道，　“这样，你就可以想当什么就当什么——政务院的审查官、省长、大使馆秘书、大使本人，由你挑。查理十世很喜欢德奥布里翁，他们从小就认识。”","“And when a man has a hundred thousand francs a year, a name, a family, and a position at court,—for I will get you appointed as gentleman-of-the-bedchamber,—he can do what he likes,” she said to Charles.“You can then become anything you choose,—master of the rolls in the council of State, prefect, secretary to an embassy, the ambassador himself, if you like.Charles X. is fond of d’Aubrion; they have known each other from childhood.”"
"夏儿陶醉于野心当中，他对这番巧妙地扮成个人隐私话的痴心妄想竟沉迷起来。他满以为他父亲的事已经由伯父料理完毕，便觉得可以一步踏进圣－日耳曼区——那个人人向往的上流社会，在那里，在玛蒂尔德小姐紫色鼻子的庇护下，他要以德奥布里翁伯爵的身份再度现身，好似德勒一家摇身一变，成了布雷兹一样。在他离开法国时，王政复辟还摇摇欲坠，现在却一派繁荣，令他眼花缭乱，贵族思想的光辉让他着迷，从船上就开始有的醉意，等他到了巴黎后更是有增无减。最后，他决心采取行动，把他那未来的岳母出于自私的愿望而指给他的高官厚禄弄到手。他的堂姐在这个光辉灿烂的远景中只不过是个小点子而已。不过，他去见了安妮特。作为真正的交际花，安妮特建议她的老朋友结这个婚，还向他许诺，她会支持他所有那些雄心勃勃的计划。在她的内心，她非常乐意把一个又丑又无趣的姑娘和夏尔夏尔栓到一起，因为西印度群岛的生活使夏尔变得非常有魅力。他的肤色变成了古铜色，他的举手投足变得坚定而果敢，好似那些惯于当机立断、支配一切，并获得成功的人一样。夏尔意识到自己现在可以有所作为了，他在巴黎活得更自在了。","Intoxicated with ambition, Charles toyed with the hopes thus cleverly presented to him in the guise of confidences poured from heart to heart.Believing his father’s affairs to have been settled by his uncle, he imagined himself suddenly anchored in the Faubourg Saint-Germain,—that social object of all desire, where, under shelter of Mademoiselle Mathilde’s purple nose, he was to reappear as the Comte d’Aubrion, very much as the Dreux reappeared in Breze.Dazzled by the prosperity of the Restoration, which was tottering when he left France, fascinated by the splendor of aristocratic ideas, his intoxication, which began on the brig, increased after he reached Paris, and he finally determined to take the course and reach the high position which the selfish hopes of his would-be mother-in-law pointed out to him.His cousin counted for no more than a speck in this brilliant perspective; but he went to see Annette.True woman of the world, Annette advised her old friend to make the marriage, and promised him her support in all his ambitious projects.In her heart she was enchanted to fasten an ugly and uninteresting girl on Charles, whose life in the West Indies had rendered him very attractive.His complexion had bronzed, his manners had grown decided and bold, like those of a man accustomed to make sharp decisions, to rule, and to succeed.Charles breathed more at his ease in Paris, conscious that he now had a part to play."
"德格拉桑听说他回来了，而且即将结婚，还发了大财，就跑来见他，想打听了结他父亲债务还需要的那三十万法郎。他看到葛朗台正在和一个金器商商议事情，从这个金器商那里，夏尔定制了首饰给德奥布里翁小姐做聘礼，当时金器商正在向他提交图样。夏尔带回了精美的钻石，那镶嵌式样的价值，连同新居所需的金银餐具和首饰，合计达二十多万法郎。他没有认出德格拉桑来，自以为曾在西印度群岛的多次决斗中杀死过四个人，他接待德格拉桑时，带着一副时髦青年的傲慢劲。德格拉桑先生已经来过几次了。夏尔冷冷地听着他说话，还没完全听懂他的意思，就回答道——","Des Grassins, hearing of his return, of his approaching marriage and his large fortune, came to see him, and inquired about the three hundred thousand francs still required to settle his father’s debts.He found Grandet in conference with a goldsmith, from whom he had ordered jewels for Mademoiselle d’Aubrion’s @corbeille@, and who was then submitting the designs.Charles had brought back magnificent diamonds, and the value of their setting, together with the plate and jewelry of the new establishment, amounted to more than two hundred thousand francs.He received des Grassins, whom he did not recognize, with the impertinence of a young man of fashion conscious of having killed four men in as many duels in the Indies.Monsieur des Grassins had already called several times.Charles listened to him coldly, and then replied, without fully understanding what had been said to him,—"
"“我父亲的事不是我的事。先生，我很感谢您这样费心——不过，对此，我确实无法领情。我汗流满面地挣来了两百万，不是为了把它们扔到我父亲的债主头上的。”","“My father’s affairs are not mine.I am much obliged, monsieur, for the trouble you have been good enough to take,—by which, however, I really cannot profit.I have not earned two millions by the sweat of my brow to fling them at the head of my father’s creditors.”"
"“可要是令尊的财产几天之内就要宣告破产呢？”","“But suppose that your father’s estate were within a few days to be declared bankrupt?”"
"“先生，再过几天，我就要被称作德奥布里翁伯爵了；因此，你会明白你的威胁对我毫无影响。而且你和我一样清楚，当一个人有十万法郎的收入时，他的父亲是决不会破产的。”这样说着，他客气地把德格拉桑先生推到了门口。","“Monsieur, in a few days I shall be called the Comte d’Aubrion; you will understand, therefore, that what you threaten is of no consequence to me.Besides, you know as well as I do that when a man has an income of a hundred thousand francs his father has @never failed@.”So saying, he politely edged Monsieur des Grassins to the door."
"当年八月初，欧仁妮正坐在堂弟曾发誓永远爱她的那个小木凳上，如果天气好的话，她通常就在这里用早餐。此时，在这清新、舒适的夏日空气里，这可怜的姑娘心情愉快，她回忆起爱情中的大小往事和随之而来的灾难。太阳刚刚晒到了破败的墙角，墙上布满了裂缝，尽管科努瓦耶经常跟他妻子说：“早晚有一天，它会倒下来砸着人的。”可是由于女主人的怪癖，谁也不许碰。这时，邮差敲响门，给了科努瓦耶太太一封信，她一边往花园跑，一边大声喊着：","At the beginning of August in the same year, Eugenie was sitting on the little wooden bench where her cousin had sworn to love her eternally, and where she usually breakfasted if the weather were fine.The poor girl was happy, for the moment, in the fresh and joyous summer air, letting her memory recall the great and the little events of her love and the catastrophes which had followed it.The sun had just reached the angle of the ruined wall, so full of chinks, which no one, through a caprice of the mistress, was allowed to touch, though Cornoiller often remarked to his wife that “it would fall and crush somebody one of these days.”At this moment the postman knocked, and gave a letter to Madame Cornoiller, who ran into the garden, crying out: "
"“小姐，信！”她把信给了女主人，又说道，“是你等的那封吧？”","“Mademoiselle, a letter!”She gave it to her mistress, adding, “Is it the one you expected?”"
"这几个字在欧仁妮的心头大声回响，强度不亚于回荡在院子和花园的墙壁之间的回声。","The words rang as loudly in the heart of Eugenie as they echoed in sound from wall to wall of the court and garden."
"“巴黎——他写的——他回来了！”","“Paris—from him—he has returned!”"
"欧仁妮脸色变得苍白，举着信呆了一会儿。她颤抖得厉害，简直都拆不了信。大个子娜农站在她前面，两手叉着腰，她的快乐好像烟一样，从她棕色脸庞的皱纹中冒了出来。","Eugenie turned pale and held the letter for a moment.She trembled so violently that she could not break the seal.La Grande Nanon stood before her, both hands on her hips, her joy puffing as it were like smoke through the cracks of her brown face."
"“看信吧，小姐！”","“Read it, mademoiselle!”"
"“啊，娜农，他为什么回了巴黎？他是从索米尔走的。”","“Ah, Nanon, why did he return to Paris?He went from Saumur.”"
"“看了信，你就知道了。”","“Read it, and you’ll find out.”"
"欧仁妮用颤抖的手指打开了信。一张“索米尔德格拉桑太太和科雷”银行的汇票飘然而落。娜农把它捡了起来。","Eugenie opened the letter with trembling fingers.A cheque on the house of “Madame des Grassins and Coret, of Saumur,” fluttered down.Nanon picked it up."
"我亲爱的堂姐——","My dear Cousin,—"
"“不再是‘欧仁妮’了。”她想着，心存恐惧。","“No longer ‘Eugenie,’” she thought, and her heart quailed."
"您——　","You—"
"“他以前是叫‘你’的呀。”她抱起胳膊，不敢再往下看，眼里噙满了大滴的泪水。","“He once said ‘thou.’”She folded her arms and dared not read another word; great tears gathered in her eyes."
"“他死了吗？”娜农问道。","“Is he dead?” asked Nanon."
"“他要是死了，就不会写信了。”欧仁妮说。","“If he were, he could not write,” said Eugenie."
"接着，她读起了整封信，全信如下：","She then read the whole letter, which was as follows: "
"我亲爱的堂姐——我相信，听说我事业有成，您一定会很高兴。您给我带来了运气；我发财回来了，我听从了我伯父的劝告。我刚刚从德格拉桑先生那里得知伯父及伯母去世的消息。父母去世是自然过程，我们必须接替他们。我希望您现在已经节哀顺变了。","My dear Cousin,—You will, I am sure, hear with pleasure of the success of my enterprise.You brought me luck; I have come back rich, and I have followed the advice of my uncle, whose death, together with that of my aunt, I have just learned from Monsieur des Grassins.The death of parents is in the course of nature, and we must succeed them.I trust you are by this time consoled."
"什么都无法抗拒时间，对此我深有体会。是的，我亲爱的堂姐，不幸的是，对我来说，幻想的时代已经过去。不然又有什么办法呢？走过很多地方以后，我已经对人生进行了思考。走时，我还是个孩子——现在回来，我已是个大人了。","Nothing can resist time, as I am well aware.Yes, my dear cousin, the day of illusions is, unfortunately, gone for me.How could it be otherwise?Travelling through many lands, I have reflected upon life.I was a child when I went away,—I have come back a man."
"今天，我想了很多那时做梦也想不到的事情。您是自由的，我亲爱的堂姐，我也还是自由的。表面上看，没有什么阻挡得了我们去实现当初的希望；但我天性坦诚，不能向您隐瞒我目前的处境。我没有忘记我们的关系；在漫长的旅程中，我一直都记着那个小木凳——　","Today, I think of many I did not dream of then.You are free, my dear cousin, and I am free still.Nothing apparently hinders the realization of our early hopes; but my nature is too loyal to hide from you the situation in which I find myself.I have not forgotten our relations; I have always remembered, throughout my long wanderings, the little wooden seat—"
"欧仁妮仿佛正坐在燃烧的炭火上一样，她站起身来，走过去，坐到了院子里的石头台阶上。","Eugenie rose as if she were sitting on live coals, and went away and sat down on the stone steps of the court."
"——我们曾坐在那个小木凳上面，发誓永远相爱，那个过道，那个灰色的大厅，我在阁楼的卧室，还有那个夜晚，由于您体贴入微的关怀，我的前程才更为顺利。是的，这些回忆给了我勇气；我在心里默念，在我们约定的时刻，您一定在想念我。","—the little wooden seat where we vowed to love each other forever, the passage, the gray hall, my attic chamber, and the night when, by your delicate kindness, you made my future easier to me.Yes, these recollections sustained my courage; I said in my heart that you were thinking of me at the hour we had agreed upon."
"您总是在九点看云彩吗？是的，我相信是这样的。我不能背叛这么真诚的友谊——不，我不可以欺骗您。我定了一门婚事，它符合我对婚姻关系的所有想法。爱情在婚姻中是个幻象。我现在的经历告诫我，结婚时，我们注定要服从所有的社会法则，符合世俗的风俗要求。","Have you always looked at the clouds at nine o’clock?Yes, I am sure of it.I cannot betray so true a friendship,—no, I must not deceive you.An alliance has been proposed to me which satisfies all my ideas of matrimony.Love in marriage is a delusion.My present experience warns me that in marrying we are bound to obey all social laws and meet the conventional demands of the world."
"我亲爱的堂姐，现在，在您和我之间存在着可能会影响到您前程的差别，这差别对您甚至比对我的影响更大。我这里且不说您的生活方式和爱好、您的教育和您的习惯，这些全都跟巴黎的生活不合拍，也不适合我为自己勾画的未来。我打算让我的家豪华排场，高朋满座——简而言之，要有大量的社交活动；我想，我还记得您喜欢的是安静而恬淡的生活。我会坦诚相见，并请您评判一下我的处境，您有权了解并做出评判。","Now, between you and me there are differences which might affect your future, my dear cousin, even more than they would mine.I will not here speak of your customs and inclinations, your education, nor yet of your habits, none of which are in keeping with Parisian life, or with the future which I have marked out for myself.My intention is to keep my household on a stately footing, to receive much company,—in short, to live in the world; and I think I remember that you love a quiet and tranquil life.I will be frank, and make you the judge of my situation; you have the right to understand it and to judge it."
"我目前拥有八万法郎的收入。这笔财富使我能够和奥布里翁家联姻，他们的女继承人，一个十九岁的小姑娘，会给我带来一个头衔、一个王室侍从的位置和一个非常显赫的地位。我得向您承认，我亲爱的堂姐，我不爱德奥布里翁小姐；但是和她结婚，我可以保证我的孩子将来有一个前途无量的社会地位：王权思想正一天比一天更吃香。这样，若干年后，等我的儿子成了德奥布里翁侯爵，那时他就会拥有四万法郎年金的限嗣继承的不动产，便可以在朝廷里获得他认为适合担当的职位。我们应该为我们的孩子尽责。","I possess at the present moment an income of eighty thousand francs.This fortune enables me to marry into the family of Aubrion, whose heiress, a young girl nineteen years of age, brings me a title, a place of gentleman-of-the-bed-chamber to His Majesty, and a very brilliant position.I will admit to you, my dear cousin, that I do not love Mademoiselle d’Aubrion; but in marrying her I secure to my children a social rank whose advantages will one day be incalculable: monarchical principles are daily coming more and more into favor.Thus in course of time my son, when he becomes Marquis d’Aubrion, having, as he then will have, an entailed estate with a rental of forty thousand francs a year, can obtain any position in the State which he may think proper to select.We owe ourselves to our children."
"您看，我的堂姐，我是多么真诚地向您表白了我心里的想法、我的希望及我的财产。也许在七年的离别之后，您已经忘记了我们年轻幼稚的爱情；可是，我从来没有忘记您的善良，也没忘记我自己的诺言。我记得所有一切，甚至包括那些不经意说出的话语——那些话语如果是由一个不像我这样认真、内心也不那么天真和正直的人说出的，他不会觉着自己有负责任的必要。我之所以告诉您我要缔结的婚约只是便利之需，还有我仍旧记得我们幼稚的爱情，我不就是在把我自己完全交到您的手中，并让您来主宰我的命运吗？难道我不是在告诉您，如果我必须放弃我对社会的野心，我会心甘情愿地满足于那纯洁而简单的幸福吗？那甜美的情景您早已让我领略到了。","You see, my cousin, with what good faith I lay the state of my heart, my hopes, and my fortune before you.Possibly, after seven years’ separation, you have yourself forgotten our youthful loves; but I have never forgotten either your kindness or my own words.I remember all, even words that were lightly uttered,—words by which a man less conscientious than I, with a heart less youthful and less upright, would scarcely feel himself bound.In telling you that the marriage I propose to make is solely one of convenience, that I still remember our childish love, am I not putting myself entirely in your hands and making you the mistress of my fate? Am I not telling you that if I must renounce my social ambitions, I shall willingly content myself with the pure and simple happiness of which you have shown me so sweet an image?"
"“当，得，得——当，得，嘀，”夏尔·葛朗台一边唱着你不要再去做情郎的调子，一边签上了自己的名字——","“Tan, ta, ta—tan, ta, ti,” sang Charles Grandet to the air of @Non piu andrai@, as he signed himself,—"
"您忠实的堂弟，夏尔。","Your devoted cousin, Charles."
"“天哪！这就是做事精明！”他一边说着，一边张望着四周找支票；找到汇票后，他又加上了这几句话——","“Thunder! That’s doing it handsomely!” he said, as he looked about him for the cheque; having found it, he added the words:—"
"又及——随信附上在您名下的德格拉桑银行八千法郎汇票一张，以黄金支付，包括了您曾那么慷慨借予我的本金和利息。我正在等候一只由波尔多运来的箱子，内有一些我想送与您的东西，聊表我无尽的感激之情，您一定要收下。您可以把我的梳妆箱交与驿车，送至德奥布里翁府邸，伊勒兰－贝尔坦街。","P.S.—I enclose a cheque on the des Grassins bank for eight thousand francs to your order, payable in gold, which includes the capital and interest of the sum you were kind enough to lend me.I am expecting a case from Bordeaux which contains a few things which you must allow me to offer you as a mark of my unceasing gratitude.You can send my dressing-case by the diligence to the hotel d’Aubrion, rue Hillerin-Bertin."
"“交与驿车！”欧仁妮说道，“一件我曾为之拼过命的东西！”","“By the diligence!” said Eugenie.“A thing for which I would have laid down my life!”"
"可怕的灭顶之灾！在希望的茫茫大海上，船沉了，没有留下一节圆杆，也没有留下一块木板！有些女人在看到自己被抛弃时，会竭力把她们的爱人从情敌怀里夺回来，她们会杀掉情敌，逃到天涯海角——上断头台，进坟墓。毫无疑问，那是很高贵的；其犯罪动机是一种伟大的激情，甚至会令人类的公正敬畏。另一些女人低下了头，默默承受痛苦；她们半死不活，听天由命，痛哭流涕，宽恕，祈祷，回忆，直到咽下最后一口气。这就是爱——真正的爱、天使的爱和在痛苦中生、在痛苦中死的高傲的爱。这就是看完那封可怕的信之后欧仁妮的爱。她抬头望天，想起她母亲临终时留下的最后遗言，母亲凭着临死时所具有的预见本能，把未来看得清楚而透彻：欧仁妮想起了母亲那先知般的死亡，那先知般的一生，转瞬间悟出了自己的命运。什么也没给她留下，她只能展开她的翅膀，振翼飞向天空，在祈祷中活着，直到她解脱的那一天。","Terrible and utter disaster!The ship went down, leaving not a spar, not a plank, on a vast ocean of hope!Some women when they see themselves abandoned will try to tear their lover from the arms of a rival, they will kill her, and rush to the ends of the earth,—to the scaffold, to their tomb.That, no doubt, is fine; the motive of the crime is a great passion, which awes even human justice.Other women bow their heads and suffer in silence; they go their way dying, resigned, weeping, forgiving, praying, and recollecting, till they draw their last breath.This is love,—true love, the love of angels, the proud love which lives upon its anguish and dies of it.Such was Eugenie’s love after she had read that dreadful letter.She raised her eyes to heaven, thinking of the last words uttered by her dying mother, who, with the prescience of death, had looked into the future with clear and penetrating eyes: Eugenie, remembering that prophetic death, that prophetic life, measured with one glance her own destiny.Nothing was left for her; she could only unfold her wings, stretch upward to the skies, and live in prayer until the day of her deliverance."
"“我母亲说得对，”她哭着说道，　“受苦——然后死去！”","“My mother was right,” she said, weeping.“Suffer—and die!”"
"第十四章","Chapter XIV "
"欧仁妮慢慢从花园走回屋子，绕开了她习惯走的过道。　但是，她对堂弟的回忆还停留在那灰色的古老大厅里和那壁炉台上，壁炉台上摆着一只碟子和塞夫尔窑制的旧糖罐，她每天早上吃饭时都要用到。","Eugenie came slowly back from the garden to the house, and avoided passing, as was her custom, through the corridor.But the memory of her cousin was in the gray old hall and on the chimney-piece, where stood a certain saucer and the old Sevres sugar-bowl which she used every morning at her breakfast."
"这一整天注定是庄严重大的，发生了诸多事件。娜农通报教区教堂的神父来了。他是克吕绍的亲戚，因而是为德蓬丰先生的利益着想的。过去这段时间，老神父力劝他纯粹从宗教的角度，和葛朗台小姐谈谈在她这种处境下女人结婚的义务。当看见本堂牧师时，欧仁妮以为他是为了她每月给穷人的那一千法郎而来的，便叫娜农去拿钱，可是神父只是微笑着。","This day was destined to be solemn throughout and full of events.Nanon announced the cure of the parish church.He was related to the Cruchots, and therefore in the interests of Monsieur de Bonfons.For some time past the old abbe had urged him to speak to Mademoiselle Grandet, from a purely religious point of view, about the duty of marriage for a woman in her position.When she saw her pastor, Eugenie supposed he had come for the thousand francs which she gave monthly to the poor, and she told Nanon to go and fetch them; but the cure only smiled."
"“今天，小姐，”他说，“我是来跟你谈谈整个索米尔城都关心的一个可怜的姑娘，她不懂得爱惜自己，忽略了她作为基督教徒的义务。”","“Today, mademoiselle,” he said, “I have come to speak to you about a poor girl in whom the whole town of Saumur takes an interest, who, through lack of charity to herself, neglects her Christian duties.”"
"“神父先生，您眼下这会儿来找我，我还无暇顾及我的邻居，我正为自己的事烦心呢。我很伤心，我唯一的避难所就是教堂；她的胸怀宽大，足以容下所有人类的痛苦，她的爱是如此丰富，我们可以从中汲取，而永不会令它枯竭。”","“Monsieur le cure, you have come to me at a moment when I cannot think of my neighbor, I am filled with thoughts of myself.I am very unhappy; my only refuge is in the Church; her bosom is large enough to hold all human woe, her love so full that we may draw from its depths and never drain it dry.”"
"“小姐，说到这位年轻的姑娘，我们也就说到了你。听着！如果你希望确保得到救赎，你只有两条路可以走——要么离开尘世，要么服从世俗的法则。服从你尘世的命运，或者服从你天国的命运。”","“Mademoiselle, in speaking of this young girl we shall speak of you.Listen!If you wish to insure your salvation you have only two paths to take,—either leave the world or obey its laws.Obey either your earthly destiny or your heavenly destiny.”"
"“啊！在我需要听取指教的时候，您就来指教我了。是的，是上帝派您到我这里的；我要告别尘世，在沉默和与世隔绝中只为主而活着。”","“Ah! Your voice speaks to me when I need to hear a voice.Yes, God has sent you to me; I will bid farewell to the world and live for God alone, in silence and seclusion.”"
"“我的孩子，在采取这样过激的行动之前，你一定要多加思考。婚姻是生，修女生活是死。”","“My daughter, you must think long before you take so violent a step.Marriage is life; the veil is death.”"
"“是的，死——赶快去死！”她说道，语气激动得令人害怕。","“Yes, death,—a quick death!” she said, with dreadful eagerness."
"“死？但是你对社会有重大的义务要完成，小姐。你难道不是穷人的母亲吗？冬天要给他们衣服和柴火，夏天要给他们工作。你偌大的财产是一笔必须清偿的贷款，你已经庄严地接受了这笔财产。你躲进修道院将是自私的表现，终身做老姑娘就是没有尽到义务。首先，你能够独自管理你偌大的家业吗？你不会把它败掉吧？你会招来官司，会发现自己陷于无法摆脱的困境当中。相信你的本堂牧师吧：一个丈夫是有用的，你一定要保护好上帝赐予你的一切。我是把你当作我最珍贵的宝贝，才跟你讲这番话的。你如此真诚地爱着上帝，就应该在尘世中找到自己的救赎，你是尘世高贵的装点，必须为尘世作出榜样。”","“Death? But you have great obligations to fulfil to society, mademoiselle.Are you not the mother of the poor, to whom you give clothes and wood in winter and work in summer?Your great fortune is a loan which you must return, and you have sacredly accepted it as such.To bury yourself in a convent would be selfishness; to remain an old maid is to fail in duty.In the first place, can you manage your vast property alone?May you not lose it?You will have law-suits; you will find yourself surrounded by inextricable difficulties.Believe your pastor: a husband is useful; you are bound to preserve what God has bestowed upon you.I speak to you as a precious lamb of my flock.You love God too truly not to find your salvation in the midst of his world, of which you are noble ornament and to which you owe your example.”"
"这时，通报说德格拉桑太太光临。她是出于报复和极度的绝望而来的。","At this moment Madame des Grassins was announced.She came incited by vengeance and the sense of a great despair."
"“小姐，”她说，“啊！神父先生在这里，那我就不说了。我来是要和你谈事情，可是我看见你们正在商议——”","“Mademoiselle,” she said—“Ah! Here is monsieur le cure; I am silent.I came to speak to you on business; but I see that you are conferring with—” "
"“夫人，”神父说，“我给您腾地方。”","“Madame,” said the cure, “I leave the field to you.”"
"“哦！神父先生，”欧仁妮说，“过会儿回来，眼下我正需要您的支持。”","“Oh! Monsieur le cure,” said Eugenie, “come back later; your support is very necessary to me just now.”"
"“啊，是的，的确，我可怜的孩子！”德格拉桑太太说道。","“Ah, yes, indeed, my poor child!” said Madame des Grassins."
"“您是什么意思？”欧仁妮和神父一齐问道。","“What do you mean?” asked Eugenie and the cure together."
"“难道我不知道你堂弟已经回来，而且要跟德奥布里翁小姐结婚的事吗？一个女人可不会把脑子揣到她的口袋里。”","“Don’t I know about your cousin’s return, and his marriage with Mademoiselle d’Aubrion?A woman doesn’t carry her wits in her pocket.”"
"欧仁妮脸红了，一时没有说话。从这天起，她总是面无表情，她父亲在这点上曾经做得很出色。","Eugenie blushed, and remained silent for a moment.From this day forth she assumed the impassible countenance for which her father had been so remarkable."
"“好吧，夫人，”过了一会儿，她语气嘲讽地说道，“无疑我是把脑子揣兜里了，因为我弄不明白您的意思。说吧，当着神父先生的面，说说您的意思，您知道他是我的本堂牧师。”","“Well, madame,” she presently said, ironically, “no doubt I carry my wits in my pocket, for I do not understand you.Speak, say what you mean, before monsieur le cure; you know he is my director.”"
"“那好，小姐，这是德格拉桑写给我的信。看看吧。”","“Well, then, mademoiselle, here is what des Grassins writes me.Read it.”"
"欧仁妮读起了下面这封信——","Eugenie read the following letter:—"
"我亲爱的妻子——夏尔·葛朗台已经从西印群岛度回来了，到巴黎大约已有一个月了——","My dear Wife,—Charles Grandet has returned from the Indies and has been in Paris about a month—"
"“一个月！”欧仁妮心想，她的手垂到了旁边。停了一下，她接着往下看——","“A month!” thought Eugenie, her hand falling to her side.After a pause she resumed the letter,—"
"我还得献媚邀宠，才被允许见到未来的德奥布里翁子爵。不过全巴黎都在谈论他的婚事，而且结婚公告也公布了——","I had to dance attendance before I was allowed to see the future Vicomte d’Aubrion.Though all Paris is talking of his marriage and the banns are published—"
"“他是在那以后才给我写的信！”欧仁妮想。她没有往下再想，也没有像巴黎女人那样大叫出“恶棍！”，但是，尽管她没有说出这个字眼，轻蔑却浮现于她的心头。","“He wrote to me after that!” thought Eugenie.She did not conclude the thought; she did not cry out, as a Parisian woman would have done, “The villain!” But though she said it not, contempt was none the less present in her mind."
"不过，这门婚事是不会成功的。德奥布里翁侯爵决不会把自己的女儿嫁给一个破产户的儿子。我去告诉葛朗台，说我和他伯父如何为他父亲的事操劳，如何巧妙运作稳住了债权人，让他们直到现在都保持沉默。那个傲慢无礼的家伙竟然有脸跟我说—— 跟我这个五年来日日夜夜为他的利益和名誉尽心尽力的人！——他父亲的事不是他的事！一个诉讼代理人有权要求总计三四万法郎的代理费，即债务总额的百分之一。不过，且慢！依照法律，他父亲还欠着债权人一百二十万法郎，我马上就可以宣告他父亲破产。","The marriage, however, will not come off.The Marquis d’Aubrion will never give his daughter to the son of a bankrupt.I went to tell Grandet of the steps his uncle and I took in his father’s business, and the clever manoeuvres by which we had managed to keep the creditor’s quiet until the present time.The insolent fellow had the face to say to me—to me, who for five years have devoted myself night and day to his interests and his honor!—that @his father’s affairs were not his@!A solicitor would have had the right to demand fees amounting to thirty or forty thousand francs, one per cent on the total of the debts.But patience! There are twelve hundred thousand francs legitimately owing to the creditors, and I shall at once declare his father a bankrupt."
"我插手这件事，凭的是那个假慈悲的老葛朗台的一句话，而且我以他家族的名义作了承诺。如果德奥布里翁子爵先生不在乎他的名誉，我还在乎我的呢。我将向债权人说明我的立场。然而，我对欧仁妮小姐非常尊敬（在境况好时，我们还曾经希望结亲），所以，我会等你跟她谈了这件事之后再采取行动——","I went into this business on the word of that old crocodile Grandet, and I have made promises in the name of his family.If Monsieur de vicomte d’Aubrion does not care for his honor, I care for mine.I shall explain my position to the creditors.Still, I have too much respect for Mademoiselle Eugenie (to whom under happier circumstances we once hoped to be allied) to act in this matter before you have spoken to her about it—"
"看到这里，欧仁妮停下来，不再看了，冷冷地把信递了回去。","There Eugenie paused, and coldly returned the letter without finishing it."
"“谢谢您了。”她对德格拉桑太太说。","“I thank you,” she said to Madame des Grassins."
"“啊！你的口气和做派跟你已故的父亲一模一样。”德格拉桑太太回答。","“Ah! You have the voice and manner of your deceased father,” Madame des Grassins replied."
"“夫人，您要付给我们八千法郎。”娜农说着，拿出了夏尔的汇票。","“Madame, you have eight thousand francs to pay us,” said Nanon, producing Charles’s cheque."
"“不错，劳驾你现在跟我跑一趟，科努瓦耶太太。”","“That’s true; have the kindness to come with me now, Madame Cornoiller.”"
"“神父先生，”欧仁妮心里拿定了主意，便高贵而镇静地说道，“婚后还保持处女之身是罪过吗？”","“Monsieur le cure,” said Eugenie with a noble composure, inspired by the thought she was about to express, “would it be a sin to remain a virgin after marriage?”"
"“那是个道德问题，我还不知道如何解答。如果你想知道著名的桑切斯在他的专著《论婚姻》中是怎么说的，我明天可以告诉你。”","“That is a case of conscience whose solution is not within my knowledge.If you wish to know what the celebrated Sanchez says of it in his treatise ‘@De Matrimonio@,’ I shall be able to tell you tomorrow.”"
"神父走了，葛朗台小姐去了她父亲的密室，在那里独自呆了一整天，连晚饭都没有下来吃，尽管娜农恳求了好几次。等晚上常客开始登门时，她才现身。这个老旧的大厅从没有像这一晚那样宾客满堂。夏尔回来的消息以及他愚蠢的背信弃义的行为已经传遍了全城。但是不管好奇的来客有多机警，他们的好奇心也没有得到满足。欧仁妮早已料到人们会细问打探，尽管内心正被痛苦之极的感情煎熬着，她的脸上却很镇静，没有丝毫的流露。大家试图以沉痛的表情或者感伤的话语来表示他们的关切，她居然还能报以微笑。她把她的不幸藏在了谦恭有礼的面纱里。快九点时，牌局结束，打牌的人们离开了桌子，一边付清了输的钱，一边谈论着牌局的分，加入到其他同伴的圈子。就在大家起身要走时，一件意想不到的惊人的事请发生了，这件事传遍了索米尔的大街小巷，从索米尔又传遍郡里，甚至传到了周边四府。","The cure went away; Mademoiselle Grandet went up to her father’s secret room and spent the day there alone, without coming down to dinner, in spite of Nanon’s entreaties.She appeared in the evening at the hour when the usual company began to arrive.Never was the old hall so full as on this occasion.The news of Charles’s return and his foolish treachery had spread through the whole town.But however watchful the curiosity of the visitors might be, it was left unsatisfied.Eugenie, who expected scrutiny, allowed none of the cruel emotions that wrung her soul to appear on the calm surface of her face.She was able to show a smiling front in answer to all who tried to testify their interest by mournful looks or melancholy speeches.She hid her misery behind a veil of courtesy.Towards nine o’clock the games ended and the players left the tables, paying their losses and discussing points of the game as they joined the rest of the company.At the moment when the whole party rose to take leave, an unexpected and striking event occurred, which resounded through the length and breadth of Saumur, from thence through the arrondissement, and even to the four surrounding prefectures."
"“等等，庭长先生。”当欧仁妮看见德蓬丰先生拿起手杖时，对他说道。","“Stay, monsieur le president,” said Eugenie to Monsieur de Bonfons as she saw him take his cane."
"众多的宾客听到这句话，全都不禁一怔。庭长脸色发白，只得坐了下来。","There was not a person in that numerous assembly who was unmoved by these words.The president turned pale, and was forced to sit down."
"“庭长拿到几百万啦。”德格里博古小姐说。","“The president gets the millions,” said Mademoiselle de Gribeaucourt."
"“那是明摆的，庭长要娶葛朗台小姐了。”多尔松瓦太太大声说道。","“It is plain enough; the president marries Mademoiselle Grandet,” cried Madame d’Orsonval."
"“所有王牌都落到了一只手中。”神父说道。","“All the trumps in one hand,” said the abbe."
"“大满贯。”公证人说。","“A love game,” said the notary."
"每个人都有自己的说法，一语双关，他们觉得女继承人高踞于百万家产之上，就好像身踞宝座一样。九年前开演的戏已经到了大结局的时候。当着全索米尔人的面叫庭长“等等”，无疑就等于宣告他是她的丈夫。在外省的城镇，人们严格地遵行着社交礼仪准则，这样的违规行为就成了一种庄严的承诺。","Each and all said his say, made his pun, and looked at the heiress mounted on her millions as on a pedestal.The drama begun nine years before had reached its conclusion.To tell the president, in face of all Saumur, to “stay,” was surely the same thing as proclaiming him her husband.In provincial towns social conventionalities are so rigidly enforced that an infraction like this constituted a solemn promise."
"“庭长先生，”等只剩下他们的时候，欧仁妮声音有些激动地说道，“我知道您喜欢我什么。您要发誓让我的一生都活得自由，不向我提任何婚姻赋予您的权利，那我就嫁给您。哦！”看见他要跪在自己脚边时，她又说道，“我还有话要说。我不应该欺骗您。在我心里，我珍藏着一份难以磨灭的感情。友谊是我唯一能给予一个丈夫的情感。我希望既不冒犯他，又不违背我内心的本能。不过，您只有帮我一个大忙后，才能拥有我的婚约和我的财产。”","“Monsieur le president,” said Eugenie in a voice of some emotion when they were left alone, “I know what pleases you in me.Swear to leave me free during my whole life, to claim none of the rights which marriage will give you over me, and my hand is yours.Oh!” she added, seeing him about to kneel at her feet, “I have more to say.I must not deceive you.In my heart I cherish one inextinguishable feeling.Friendship is the only sentiment which I can give to a husband.I wish neither to affront him nor to violate the laws of my own heart.But you can possess my hand and my fortune only at the cost of doing me an inestimable service.”"
"“干什么我都愿意。”庭长说。","“I am ready for all things,” said the president."
"“这是一百五十万法郎，”她从胸口拿出一张法兰西银行一百股的股权证，说道，“去巴黎——不是明天，而是即刻。找德格拉桑先生，了解我叔父的债权人的名单，把他们召集起来，全额偿清欠他们的债务，按百分之五计息，从债务生效当日算起，一直算到现在。切记要拿到合法的全额收据，手续要完备，并做公证。您是个执法官，我可以把这件事托付给您。您是个正直的人，我将信任您的诺言，在您的姓氏的庇护下，来迎接人生的危难。咱们彼此要宽容。我们相识多年，差不多都成了亲戚，您一定不希望让我痛苦吧。”","“Here are fifteen hundred thousand francs,” she said, drawing from her bosom a certificate of a hundred shares in the Bank of France.“Go to Paris,—not tomorrow, but instantly.Find Monsieur des Grassins, learn the names of my uncle’s creditors, call them together, pay them in full all that was owing, with interest at five per cent from the day the debt was incurred to the present time.Be careful to obtain a full and legal receipt, in proper form, before a notary.You are a magistrate, and I can trust this matter in your hands.You are a man of honor; I will put faith in your word, and meet the dangers of life under shelter of your name.Let us have mutual indulgence.We have known each other so long that we are almost related; you would not wish to render me unhappy.”"
"庭长扑倒在富有的女继承人的脚下，他的心砰砰跳着，喜得发疼。","The president fell at the feet of the rich heiress, his heart beating and wrung with joy."
"“我以后就是您的奴隶！”他说。","“I will be your slave!” he said."
"“先生，等您拿到收据，”她冷冷地瞥了他一眼，继续说道，“您就把收据连同其他所有文件都交给我的堂弟葛朗台，然后把这封信也交给他。等您一回来，我就履行我的诺言。”","“When you obtain the receipts, monsieur,” she resumed, with a cold glance, “you will take them with all the other papers to my cousin Grandet, and you will give him this letter.On your return I will keep my word.”"
"庭长心里很明白，他知道葛朗台小姐的默许是因为她对爱情的失望，便赶快照她的吩咐去办，以免时间一长，那对情侣再复合了。","The president understood perfectly that he owed the acquiescence of Mademoiselle Grandet to some bitterness of love, and he made haste to obey her orders, lest time should effect a reconciliation between the pair."
"等德蓬丰先生离开之后，欧仁妮瘫坐在椅子里，嚎啕大哭。一切都结束了。","When Monsieur de Bonfons left her, Eugenie fell back in her chair and burst into tears.All was over."
"庭长坐上驿车，第二天晚上就到了巴黎。到达后的第二天早上，他去见了德格拉桑，然后他们一起把债权人召集起来，去公证人的事务所开会，那里存放着付款凭单。债权人没有一个缺席的。他们虽说是债权人，可还是要为他们说句公道话——他们都很准时。德蓬丰先生以葛朗台小姐的名义，将他们的债务连同利息悉数付给他们。照付利息在当时的巴黎商界算是件引人瞩目的事情。等收据全部按法律程序做了登记，德格拉桑也因其效劳而收到了欧仁妮吩咐给他的五万法郎之后，庭长便赶往德奥布里翁府邸，找到了夏尔，当时夏尔刚刚和他未来的岳父正式会完面进了自己的房间。老侯爵明确地告诉他，只有等纪尧姆·葛朗台的欠款全部清偿之后，才能娶他的的女儿。","The president took the mail-post, and reached Paris the next evening.The morning after his arrival he went to see des Grassins, and together they summoned the creditors to meet at the notary’s office where the vouchers had been deposited.Not a single creditor failed to be present.Creditors though they were, justice must be done to them,—they were all punctual.Monsieur de Bonfons, in the name of Mademoiselle Grandet, paid them the amount of their claims with interest.The payment of interest was a remarkable event in the Parisian commerce of that day.When the receipts were all legally registered, and des Grassins had received for his services the sum of fifty thousand francs allowed to him by Eugenie, the president made his way to the hotel d’Aubrion and found Charles just entering his own apartment after a serious encounter with his prospective father-in-law.The old marquis had told him plainly that he should not marry his daughter until all the creditors of Guillaume Grandet had been paid in full."
"庭长给了夏尔下面这封信——","The president gave Charles the following letter:—"
"我的堂弟——我叔父欠下的所有债务都已清偿完毕，德蓬丰庭长先生代我向你转交债务的清欠收据，另有收据一张，以此确认我已收到你归还的全部债务款项。我已听到可能破产的传言，我想一个破产户的儿子也许不可以跟德奥布里翁小姐结婚。是的，我的堂弟，你对我的头脑和我的举止所做的评判是正确的。的确，我与上流社会毫不相干；我既不懂算计，也不懂风俗习惯；而且我无法给予你想从中寻求的乐趣。为了那些社会习俗，你牺牲了我们的爱情，但愿你能遵从那些习俗，并获得幸福。为了成全你的幸福，我只能给你送上你父亲的名誉。再见！你的堂姐欧仁妮将永远是你忠实的朋友。","My Cousin,—Monsieur le president de Bonfons has undertaken to place in your hands the acquittance for all claims upon my uncle, also a receipt by which I acknowledge having received from you the sum total of those claims.I have heard of a possible failure, and I think that the son of a bankrupt may not be able to marry Mademoiselle d’Aubrion.Yes, my cousin, you judged rightly of my mind and of my manners.I have, it is true, no part in the world; I understand neither its calculations nor its customs; and I could not give you the pleasures that you seek in it.Be happy, according to the social conventions to which you have sacrificed our love.To make your happiness complete I can only offer you your father’s honor.Adieu!You will always have a faithful friend in your cousin Eugenie."
"那个野心勃勃的年轻人在接过文件时，忍不住惊呼了起来，庭长对此微微一笑。","The president smiled at the exclamation which the ambitious young man could not repress as he received the documents."
"“我们同时要宣告我们的婚事。”德蓬丰先生说道。　","“We shall announce our marriages at the same time,” remarked Monsieur de Bonfons."
"“啊！您要娶欧仁妮？好啊，我很高兴，她是个好姑娘。不过，”夏尔脑子里闪过一个念头，又说道，“她一定很有钱吧？”","“Ah! You marry Eugenie?Well, I am delighted; she is a good girl.But,” added Charles, struck with a luminous idea, “she must be rich?”"
"“四天前，”庭长带着顽皮的微笑，说道，“她大约有一千九百万；可是，今天她只有一千七百万了。”","“She had,” said the president, with a mischievous smile, “about nineteen millions four days ago; but she has only seventeen millions today.”"
"夏尔看着他，惊呆了。","Charles looked at him thunderstruck."
"“一千七百——”","“Seventeen mil—” "
"“一千七百万，是的，先生。等我们结了婚，葛朗台小姐和我，我们合起来有七十五万法郎的收入。”","“Seventeen millions; yes, monsieur.We shall muster, Mademoiselle Grandet and I, an income of seven hundred and fifty thousand francs when we marry.”"
"“我亲爱的堂姐夫，”夏尔恢复了一点儿镇定，说道，“咱们可以互相提携了。”","“My dear cousin,” said Charles, recovering a little of his assurance, “we can push each other’s fortunes.”"
"“同意，”庭长说，“这里还有个小箱子，我奉命当面交到你的手中。”他一边把装着梳妆箱的皮箱子放到桌子上，一边补充道。","“Agreed,” said the president.“Here is also a little case which I am charged to give into your own hands,” he added, placing on the table the leather box which contained the dressing-case."
"“哎哟，我亲爱的朋友，”德奥布里翁太太没有注意到庭长，她一边说着，一边进了屋子，“可怜的德奥布里翁先生刚才跟你说的话，你别放在心上，德肖利厄公爵夫人把他搞得昏了头。我再说一遍，什么也阻挡不了这门婚事——”","“Well, my dear friend,” said Madame d’Aubrion, entering the room without noticing the president, “don’t pay any attention to what poor Monsieur d’Aubrion has just said to you; the Duchesse de Chaulieu has turned his head.I repeat, nothing shall interfere with the marriage—” "
"“很好，夫人。我父亲欠的那三百万昨天已经还清了。”","“Very good, madame.The three millions which my father owed were paid yesterday.”"
"“用现金？”她问道。","“In money?” she asked."
"“是的，全部，连本带利，我要为他恢复名誉——”","“Yes, in full, capital and interest; and I am about to do honor to his memory—” "
"“真蠢！”他的岳母叫起来，“这位是谁？”她看见了庭长，于是就在葛朗台耳边小声说道。","“What folly!” exclaimed his mother-in-law.“Who is this?” she whispered in Grandet’s ear, perceiving the president."
"“我的经纪人。”他低声答道。","“My man of business,” he answered in a low voice."
"侯爵夫人傲慢地冲德蓬丰先生点了点头。","The marquise bowed superciliously to Monsieur de Bonfons."
"“咱们已经在互相提携了，”庭长拿起他的帽子，说道，“再见，堂弟。”","“We are pushing each other’s fortunes already,” said the president, taking up his hat.“Goodby, cousin.”"
"“他在嘲笑我，这个老鹦鹉！我真恨不得一剑戳破他的肚子！”夏尔嘟哝着。","“He is laughing at me, the old cockatoo!I’d like to put six inches of iron into him!” muttered Charles."
"庭长没听见。三天后，德蓬丰先生一回到索米尔，就宣布了他和欧仁妮的婚事。婚后六个月，他被任命为昂热王室法院的政务委员。在离开索米尔之前，德蓬丰太太把她曾经珍藏的一些金首饰都熔掉，连上她堂弟还回来的八千法郎，做成了一只金圣体盒，送给了教区教堂，她曾在那里为他祷告了多年。她现在来回奔波于昂热和索米尔之间。她丈夫曾经在某个政治事件中表现突出，成了高等法院的法官，在过了几年之后，最终当上了高等法院的院长。他急切地等着大选，希望能入选下议院。他热切地盼望能拥有贵族的爵位，然后再——","The president was out of hearing.Three days later Monsieur de Bonfons, on his return to Saumur, announced his marriage with Eugenie.Six months after the marriage he was appointed councillor in the Court Royal at Angers.Before leaving Saumur Madame de Bonfons had the gold of certain jewels, once so precious to her, melted up, and put, together with the eight thousand francs paid back by her cousin, into a golden pyx, which she gave to the parish church where she had so long prayed for @him@.She now spent her time between Angers and Saumur.Her husband, who had shown some public spirit on a certain occasion, became a judge in the superior courts, and finally, after a few years, president of them.He was anxiously awaiting a general election, in the hope of being returned to the Chamber of deputies.He hankered after a peerage; and then—"
"“国王就会跟他称兄道弟了，是不是？”大个子娜农——科努瓦耶太太，也是索米尔的中产阶级，听到她的女主人正在列举上述显赫的头衔时，说道。","“The king will be his cousin, won’t he?” said Nanon, la Grande Nanon, Madame Cornoiller, bourgeoise of Saumur, as she listened to her mistress, who was recounting the honors to which she was called."
"然而，德蓬丰先生（他最终废止了他的祖姓克吕绍）没有能实现他那些雄心勃勃的想法。他当选为索米尔议员八天之后就死了。明察秋毫、从不错罚的上帝惩罚了他，毫无疑问，是因为他卑鄙的算计和玩弄法律的手段，他由克吕绍做参谋，在起早婚姻契约时写明，“倘无子女，夫妻双方的全部各类财产，包括不动产和动产，绝无例外，抑无保留，将互赠对方，而无须办理遗产登记之正式手续；以上述免除遗产登记不损害他们的继承人和受让人为条件，须知该互赠行为乃……等等，等等。”","Nevertheless, Monsieur de Bonfons (he had finally abolished his patronymic of Cruchot) did not realize any of his ambitious ideas.He died eight days after his election as deputy of Saumur.God, who sees all and never strikes amiss, punished him, no doubt, for his sordid calculations and the legal cleverness with which, @accurante Cruchot@, he had drawn up his marriage contract, in which husband and wife gave to each other, “in case they should have no children, their entire property of every kind, landed or otherwise, without exception or reservation, dispensing even with the formality of an inventory; provided that said omission of said inventory shall not injure their heirs and assigns, it being understood that this deed of gift is, etc., etc.”"
"契约中的这一条款便解释了院长先生对德蓬丰太太的意愿，尤其是对她的独居生活一向极为尊重的原因。女人们赞许他是最体贴、最细心的男人，她们同情他，甚至指责欧仁妮的痴情和痛苦，女人都很了解怎么去指摘别人，所以她们指责欧仁妮时，含沙射影，言辞恶毒。","This clause of the contract will explain the profound respect which monsieur le president always testified for the wishes, and above all, for the solitude of Madame de Bonfons.Women cited him as the most considerate and delicate of men, pitied him, and even went so far as to find fault with the passion and grief of Eugenie, blaming her, as women know so well how to blame, with cruel but discreet insinuation."
"“德蓬丰太太一定病得厉害，才让她丈夫独自一个人过的。可怜的女人！她能康复吗？是什么病？胃部的病？癌症？”——“她的脸色已经变得非常黄。她应该去巴黎找个有名的医生看看。”——“她没有孩子怎么能幸福呢？他们说她爱她的丈夫，那为什么不给他生个子嗣呢？——再说，他又有那样的地位！”——“你知道吗，那真是可怕！如果只是出于任性，可真是不可饶恕。可怜的院长！”","“Madame de Bonfons must be very ill to leave her husband entirely alone.Poor woman!Is she likely to get well?What is it?Something gastric?A cancer?”—“She has grown perfectly yellow.She ought to consult some celebrated doctor in Paris.”—“How can she be happy without a child?They say she loves her husband; then why not give him an heir?—In his position, too!”—“Do you know, it is really dreadful!If it is the result of mere caprice, it is unpardonable.Poor president!”"
"欧仁妮凭着她细致入微的观察力（这是一个孤寂的灵魂通过不断的冥思默想，一个离群索居者通过对周遭一切毫无遗漏、目光敏锐的关注所学来的本领），又靠着她饱受劫难并从中学会洞悉人心的一番磨炼，她很清楚，院长巴不得她死了，好占有他们的巨额财产，再加上他的公证人叔叔和神父叔叔的财产，他们家业就更庞大了，而最近上帝一高兴，把他们都召到了身边。　","Endowed with the delicate perception which a solitary soul acquires through constant meditation, through the exquisite clear-sightedness with which a mind aloof from life fastens on all that falls within its sphere, Eugenie, taught by suffering and by her later education to divine thought, knew well that the president desired her death that he might step into possession of their immense fortune, augmented by the property of his uncle the notary and his uncle the abbe, whom it had lately pleased God to call to himself."
"这位可怜的独居者很怜悯院长。上帝替她报了仇，惩罚了一个丈夫的算计和无情，这位丈夫尊重她那种终其一生而无望的痴情，因为那是对他最可靠的保护。生了孩子就会使院长的希望落空——他在展望未来时，满脑子都是自私的希望和实现野心的快意。","The poor solitary pitied the president.Providence avenged her for the calculations and the indifference of a husband who respected the hopeless passion on which she spent her life because it was his surest safeguard.To give life to a child would give death to his hopes,—the hopes of selfishness, the joys of ambition, which the president cherished as he looked into the future."
"上帝因此把成堆的金子扔到了这个囚徒的身上，而她觉得金子是无关紧要的事情，她向往天国，她虔诚而善良，活在圣洁的思想中，暗中救助不幸者，而且永远乐此不疲。德蓬丰太太三十六岁时成了寡妇。她依然美丽，不过是那种年近四十的妇人之美。她面色白皙，平和而镇静；她的声音柔和而沉着；她的举止简单而朴实。她的痛苦中显示了极为高贵的品质，她具有灵魂未被尘世玷污过的那种圣洁；但是，她也有老处女的刻板脾性和小气的习惯，这种习惯是跟外省的闭塞生活分不开的。尽管有庞大的财产，她依然过着可怜的欧仁妮·葛朗台曾经过的那种生活。她的壁炉从来不生火，除非到了从前她父亲允许大厅生火的那天，熄火的时间也是按照她年轻时就奉行的规矩来的。她穿着跟她母亲一样的衣服。索米尔的屋子没有阳光，没有温暖，终年阴暗而凄凉，这就是她一生的写照。她把收入都仔细地积攒起来，要不是恐遭非议，慷慨解囊做些善事，她可能会显得非常吝啬。几所宗教和慈善机构、一家养老院、几所教会小学和一所馆藏丰富的公共图书馆便推翻了某些人指责她贪财的说法。她出资修缮了索米尔的几座教堂。多数人都很敬重德蓬丰太太（有时被人挖苦地称作小姐），但是，她那颗高贵的、只为温情而跳动的心，自始至终却在经受着人类自私自利的盘算；金钱在冷冰冰地影响着她那神圣的生活，使一个感情丰富的女子不再相信感情。","God thus flung piles of gold upon this prisoner to whom gold was a matter of indifference, who longed for heaven, who lived, pious and good, in holy thoughts, succoring the unfortunate in secret, and never wearying of such deeds.Madame de Bonfons became a widow at thirty-six.She is still beautiful, but with the beauty of a woman who is nearly forty years of age.Her face is white and placid and calm; her voice gentle and self-possessed; her manners are simple.She has the noblest qualities of sorrow, the saintliness of one who has never soiled her soul by contact with the world; but she has also the rigid bearing of an old maid and the petty habits inseparable from the narrow round of provincial life.In spite of her vast wealth, she lives as the poor Eugenie Grandet once lived.The fire is never lighted on her hearth until the day when her father allowed it to be lighted in the hall, and it is put out in conformity with the rules which governed her youthful years.She dresses as her mother dressed.The house in Saumur, without sun, without warmth, always in shadow, melancholy, is an image of her life.She carefully accumulates her income, and might seem parsimonious did she not disarm criticism by a noble employment of her wealth.Pious and charitable institutions, a hospital for old age, Christian schools for children, a public library richly endowed, bear testimony against the charge of avarice which some persons lay at her door.The churches of Saumur owe much of their embellishment to her.Madame de Bonfons (sometimes ironically spoken of as mademoiselle) inspires for the most part reverential respect: and yet that noble heart, beating only with tenderest emotions, has been, from first to last, subjected to the calculations of human selfishness; money has cast its frigid influence upon that hallowed life and taught distrust of feelings to a woman who is all feeling."
"“只有你是爱我的。”她对娜农说。","“I have none but you to love me,” she says to Nanon."
"这个女人的手抚平了许多家庭隐密的伤痛。伴随着一系列的善举，她在向天国走去。她心灵的伟大弥补了她所受教育的欠缺以及她早年生活习惯的小气。","The hand of this woman stanches the secret wounds in many families.She goes on her way to heaven attended by a train of benefactions.The grandeur of her soul redeems the narrowness of her education and the petty habits of her early life."
"这就是欧仁妮·葛朗台的人生经历，她活在这个世上，却不属于这个世界；她天生是个贤妻良母，却既无丈夫，又无子女，更无家庭。最近，她的再嫁问题又被人提起。索米尔人议论的是她和德弗罗瓦丰侯爵，因为侯爵一家正开始包围这位有钱的寡妇，就像以前克吕绍一家围攻这位富有的女继承人一样。据说，娜农和科努瓦耶都站在侯爵这一边。没有什么比这荒谬的了。无论是大个子娜农，还是科努瓦耶，凭他们的头脑，是看不透这个世界有多腐朽的。","Such is the history of Eugenie Grandet, who is in the world but not of it; who, created to be supremely a wife and mother, has neither husband nor children nor family.Lately there has been some question of her marrying again.The Saumur people talk of her and of the Marquis de Froidfond, whose family are beginning to beset the rich widow just as, in former days, the Cruchots laid siege to the rich heiress.Nanon and Cornoiller are, it is said, in the interests of the marquis.Nothing could be more false.Neither la Grande Nanon nor Cornoiller has sufficient mind to understand the corruptions of the world."
