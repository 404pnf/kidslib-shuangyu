"鸽子先生和鸽子太太","Mr. and Mrs. Dove"
"作者：曼斯菲尔德","by Katherine Mansfield"
"他当然知道——没人比他更清楚地知道——他没有一丝的机会，一丁点都没有。就连想想这种事情都很荒谬。如此地荒谬，他完全理解，要是她父亲——当然，无论她父亲打算怎么做，他都完全理解。事实上，只是因为绝望，因为这已是他在英国的最后一天。天晓得他要在国外呆多久，所以他鼓起勇气要这样做。但即使是现在……他从衣柜抽屉里取出一条领带，一条蓝色和淡黄的方格领带，坐在床边上。如果她回答：“太没礼貌了！”他会吃惊吗？","Of course he knew—no man better—that he hadn’t a ghost of a chance, he hadn’t an earthly.The very idea of such a thing was preposterous.So preposterous that he’d perfectly understand it if her father—well, whatever her father chose to do he’d perfectly understand.In fact, nothing short of desperation, nothing short of the fact that this was positively his last day in England for God knows how long, would have screwed him up to it.And even now... He chose a tie out of the chest of drawers, a blue and cream check tie, and sat on the side of his bed.Supposing she replied, “What impertinence!” would he be surprised?"
"才不会呢，他想。他竖起软领，翻下来盖上领带。他料想她会说些类似的话。若是他非常冷静地审视这件事的话，他想不出，除此之外她还会说出些别的什么。","Not in the least, he decided, turning up his soft collar and turning it down over the tie.He expected her to say something like that.He didn’t see, if he looked at the affair dead soberly, what else she could say."
"快看他！站在镜子前，他紧张地打了个蝴蝶结，用双手把他的头发捋顺下来，掏出夹克衫的兜盖。在水果园的年收入是五六百英镑，可水果园偏偏是在——罗得西亚。没有资本。一个便士他也拿不到。至少四年他的收入不可能增长。至于长相这些东西，他也毫无突出之处。他甚至不能夸耀有着最棒的体格。东非的生意彻底搞垮了他的身体，使他不得不休养半年之久。他的脸白得吓人——今天下午甚至比平时还要糟。他想着，弯腰向前，看向镜中。天啊！这是怎么了？他的头发看起来几乎是亮绿色的。真见鬼，无论如何他从未有过绿头发。这还真有些太夸张了。之后，绿光在镜中颤动起来；原来是屋外一棵树的影子。雷吉转过身，拿出他的香烟盒，但当他想到他妈妈多么讨厌他在卧室里吸烟时，他又把它放了回去，慢慢地踱到了衣柜前。不，如果他能想到一件对他有利的好事情，那才叫奇怪呢，而她……啊！……他突然停下来，双臂交叉，紧紧靠在衣柜上。","Here he was!And nervously he tied a bow in front of the mirror, jammed his hair down with both hands, pulled out the flaps of his jacket pockets.Making between 500 and 600 pounds a year on a fruit farm in—of all places—Rhodesia.No capital.Not a penny coming to him.No chance of his income increasing for at least four years.As for looks and all that sort of thing, he was completely out of the running.He couldn’t even boast of top-hole health, for the East Africa business had knocked him out so thoroughly that he’d had to take six months’ leave.He was still fearfully pale—worse even than usual this afternoon, he thought, bending forward and peering into the mirror.Good heavens!What had happened?His hair looked almost bright green.Dash it all, he hadn’t green hair at all events.That was a bit too steep.And then the green light trembled in the glass; it was the shadow from the tree outside.Reggie turned away, took out his cigarette case, but remembering how the mater hated him to smoke in his bedroom, put it back again and drifted over to the chest of drawers.No, he was dashed if he could think of one blessed thing in his favour, while she... Ah!...He stopped dead, folded his arms, and leaned hard against the chest of drawers."
"尽管她地位高贵，父亲是个有钱人，她是家中独女，还是附近一带最受欢迎的女孩；尽管她漂亮、聪颖——聪颖！——远远不止聪颖，简直没有她不会做的；他完全相信，如果必要的话，她可以成为任何方面的天才——尽管她的父母宠爱她，她也爱他们，他们愿意让她一直这样，只要……尽管有这许多的“尽管”，他的深切爱意仍让他止不住抱有希望。唉，可这是希望吗？又或是奇怪而胆怯的渴望——有机会能够照顾她，有责任看着她拥有她想要的一切，一切不完美的东西远离她——这就是爱吗？他多爱她呀！他紧紧靠着衣柜，对着它轻声说：“我爱她，我爱她！”就在那时，他仿佛正和她前往乌姆塔利。那是一个夜晚。她坐在角落里睡着了。她柔软的下巴缩进她柔软的衣领里，金棕色的睫毛贴在脸颊上。他喜爱她小巧的鼻子，绝美的嘴唇，婴儿般的耳朵和半遮半盖着耳朵的金棕色卷发。他们正穿越丛林。那片丛林温暖、幽暗而又遥远。后来她醒过来问道：“我睡着了吗？”他回答道：“是的。你还好吧？来，让我——”他将身子探向前去……俯身在她身上。这是如此幸福，他不敢再梦想下去了。但这给了他勇气，他三步两步地走下楼，在门厅拿起草帽，一边关上前门一边说：“唉！我只能碰碰运气了，只能这样了。”","And in spite of her position, her father’s wealth, the fact that she was an only child and far and away the most popular girl in the neighbourhood; in spite of her beauty and her cleverness—cleverness!—it was a great deal more than that, there was really nothing she couldn’t do; he fully believed, had it been necessary, she would have been a genius at anything—in spite of the fact that her parents adored her, and she them, and they’d as soon let her go all that way as... In spite of every single thing you could think of, so terrific was his love that he couldn’t help hoping.Well, was it hope?Or was this queer, timid longing to have the chance of looking after her, of making it his job to see that she had everything she wanted, and that nothing came near her that wasn’t perfect—just love?How he loved her!He squeezed hard against the chest of drawers and murmured to it, “I love her, I love her!”And just for the moment he was with her on the way to Umtali.It was night.She sat in a corner asleep.Her soft chin was tucked into her soft collar, her gold-brown lashes lay on her cheeks.He doted on her delicate little nose, her perfect lips, her ear like a baby’s, and the gold-brown curl that half covered it.They were passing through the jungle.It was warm and dark and far away.Then she woke up and said, “Have I been asleep?”and he answered, “Yes.Are you all right?Here, let me—” And he leaned forward to... He bent over her.This was such bliss that he could dream no further.But it gave him the courage to bound downstairs, to snatch his straw hat from the hall, and to say as he closed the front door, “Well, I can only try my luck, that’s all.”"
"但是他的运气似乎不怎么样，至少几乎立刻就表现出来了。妈妈正在花园的小路上和老狮子狗切尼和比蒂踱来踱去地散步。雷金纳德当然是喜欢妈妈、心疼妈妈的。她——她本意是好的，有着无尽的勇气和毅力等诸如此类的优点。但不可否认，她是一位相当严厉的母亲。在雷吉印象中，阿利克叔叔去世并留给他水果园之前，有很多时候他都深信，作为一个寡妇的独子可能是对一个年轻人最重的惩罚。最糟糕的是，她确实是他的所有。她不仅仅母兼父职，可以说，在雷吉开始赚第一笔钱之前，她已跟她自己的和州长的所有亲戚朋友都吵翻了。所以每当雷吉身居异乡怀念家乡时，他坐在星光下的黑暗走廊上，听着留声机唱着：“亲爱的，人生即是爱吗？”他看到的只是他高大健壮的妈妈伴着沙沙声走过花园的小路，身后跟着切尼和比蒂。","But his luck gave him a nasty jar, to say the least, almost immediately.Promenading up and down the garden path with Chinny and Biddy, the ancient Pekes, was the mater.Of course Reginald was fond of the mater and all that.She—she meant well, she had no end of grit, and so on.But there was no denying it, she was rather a grim parent.And there had been moments, many of them, in Reggie’s life, before Uncle Alick died and left him the fruit farm, when he was convinced that to be a widow’s only son was about the worst punishment a chap could have.And what made it rougher than ever was that she was positively all that he had.She wasn’t only a combined parent, as it were, but she had quarrelled with all her own and the governor’s relations before Reggie had won his first trouser pockets.So that whenever Reggie was homesick out there, sitting on his dark veranda by starlight, while the gramophone cried, “Dear, what is Life but Love?” his only vision was of the mater, tall and stout, rustling down the garden path, with Chinny and Biddy at her heels..."
"妈妈手里拿着剪刀，正准备剪掉枯枝败叶的顶部，看到雷吉后就停了下来。","The mater, with her scissors outspread to snap the head of a dead something or other, stopped at the sight of Reggie."
"“你不是要出去吧，雷金纳德？”看到他要出去，她问道。“我会回来喝茶，妈妈。”雷吉低声说着，把手插进夹克衫口袋。","“You are not going out, Reginald?”  she asked, seeing that he was.“I’ll be back for tea, mater,” said Reggie weakly, plunging his hands into his jacket pockets."
"咔嚓！一支花顶掉了下来。雷吉几乎跳了起来。","Snip.Off came a head.Reggie almost jumped."
"“我还以为你在家的最后一个下午能在家陪陪妈妈呢。”她说。","“I should have thought you could have spared your mother your last afternoon,” said she."
"他没有回答。狮子狗瞪着眼睛。它们懂得这位妈妈的每一句话。比蒂趴在地上，伸着舌头。她很胖，皮毛光滑，看起来像块正在融化的太妃糖。但是切尼陶瓷般的眼睛忧郁地看着雷金纳德，轻轻地嗅着，好像整个世界的味道都变得忧伤。咔嚓！剪刀又响了一下。可怜的小花们，要倒霉了！","Silence.The Pekes stared.They understood every word of the mater’s.Biddy lay down with her tongue poked out; she was so fat and glossy she looked like a lump of half-melted toffee.But Chinny’s porcelain eyes gloomed at Reginald, and he sniffed faintly, as though the whole world were one unpleasant smell.Snip, went the scissors again.Poor little beggars; they were getting it!"
"“妈妈能问问你要去哪儿吗？”妈妈问道。雷吉最终结束了和母亲的谈话。但他直到看不见自家的房子，走到去普罗克特上校家的半路时，他才放慢了脚步。在那时他才注意到这个下午的天气是那么好。整个上午都在下雨，这夏季最后日子里的雨温暖、稠密而迅速。现在天空晴了，只有几缕云彩像小鸭般游过森林的上空。微风拂过，力量刚好能摇落树上最后的雨滴；一滴温暖的雨滴溅落到他手上。砰！又一滴打在他的草帽上。空荡荡的路面闪着光，树篱散发出欧石南的芳香，村舍花园里蜀葵花正绚烂地开着。普罗克特上校的家到了——已经到了。他的手放在门上，肘腕摇动了紫丁香花丛，花瓣和花粉散落衣袖。不，再等一下。这一切太快了。他本打算把整件事再彻底想一遍的。现在，要镇定。但他正沿着小路走过去，路两旁是盛开的玫瑰花花丛。这样子可不行。可他的手已抓住了门铃，猛拉铃绳，门铃声大起，好像他是来通知这座房子着火了一样。女仆这会儿一定也在门厅，因为前门一下子就打开了。在那讨厌的门铃停止响动前，雷吉已经被关进空荡的客厅里了。奇怪的是，当门铃不响了，看着这间阴暗的大屋子和一把不知道谁放在大钢琴上的阳伞，倒使他打起精神来——更确切地说，使他兴奋起来。房间里一片寂静。然而门很快会被打开，他的命运也即将揭晓。这感觉与看牙医没什么两样；他几乎什么都不在乎了。但是就在那时，令雷吉大吃一惊的是，他发现自己正念着：“上帝啊！您知道，您并未帮助过我什么……”这使他停下来，也使他知道这件事多么严肃。但一切都太晚了。门把手转动了。安妮走进来，穿过他们之间阴暗的距离，把手递给他并柔声说道：“很抱歉，我父亲出去了。我母亲去城里买帽子了。只有我招待你了，雷吉。”","“And where are you going, if your mother may ask?” asked the mater.It was over at last, but Reggie did not slow down until he was out of sight of the house and half-way to Colonel Proctor’s.Then only he noticed what a top-hole afternoon it was.It had been raining all the morning, late summer rain, warm, heavy, quick, and now the sky was clear, except for a long tail of little clouds, like duckings, sailing over the forest.There was just enough wind to shake the last drops off the trees; one warm star splashed on his hand.Ping!—another drummed on his hat.The empty road gleamed, the hedges smelled of briar, and how big and bright the hollyhocks glowed in the cottage gardens.And here was Colonel Proctor’s—here it was already.His hand was on the gate, his elbow jogged the syringa bushes, and petals and pollen scattered over his coat sleeve.But wait a bit.This was too quick altogether.He’d meant to think the whole thing out again.Here, steady.But he was walking up the path, with the huge rose bushes on either side.It can’t be done like this.But his hand had grasped the bell, given it a pull, and started it pealing wildly, as if he’d come to say the house was on fire.The housemaid must have been in the hall, too, for the front door flashed open, and Reggie was shut in the empty drawing-room before that confounded bell had stopped ringing.Strangely enough, when it did, the big room, shadowy, with some one’s parasol lying on top of the grand piano, bucked him up—or rather, excited him.It was so quiet, and yet in one moment the door would open, and his fate be decided.The feeling was not unlike that of being at the dentist’s; he was almost reckless.But at the same time, to his immense surprise, Reggie heard himself saying, “Lord, Thou knowest, Thou hast not done much for me...” That pulled him up; that made him realize again how dead serious it was.Too late.The door handle turned.Anne came in, crossed the shadowy space between them, gave him her hand, and said, in her small, soft voice, “I’m so sorry, father is out.And mother is having a day in town, hat-hunting.There’s only me to entertain you, Reggie.”"
"雷吉喘着粗气，把帽子贴向胸前夹克衫的纽扣，结结巴巴地说：“事实上，我只是来……来说再见的。”“噢！”安妮柔声叫道——她往后退了几步，灰眼睛闪动着——“这么短的拜访啊！”","Reggie gasped, pressed his own hat to his jacket buttons, and stammered out, “As a matter of fact, I’ve only come… to say good-bye.”“Oh!” cried Anne softly—she stepped back from him and her grey eyes danced—“what a very short visit!”"
"然后，她看着他，翘起下巴，立刻笑起来，一阵长长的、温柔的笑。她从他身旁走开，来到钢琴旁，靠在上面，摆弄着那把阳伞上的流苏。","Then, watching him, her chin tilted, she laughed outright, a long, soft peal, and walked away from him over to the piano, and leaned against it, playing with the tassel of the parasol."
"“很抱歉，”她说，“我总这样子笑。我也不知道为什么这样。它就是个坏——坏习惯。”突然她使劲跺着穿灰鞋子的脚，又从白羊毛外套里掏出一块手绢。“我真得改改这个坏习惯了，这太蠢了。”她说。","“I’m so sorry,” she said, “to be laughing like this.I don’t know why I do.It’s just a bad ha—habit.”And suddenly she stamped her grey shoe, and took a pocket-handkerchief out of her white woolly jacket.“I really must conquer it, it’s too absurd,” said she."
"“天哪！安妮，”雷吉大叫道，“我爱听你笑！我简直想象不到任何东西会比你的笑还——”","“Good heavens, Anne,” cried Reggie, “I love to hear you laughing!I can’t imagine anything more—”"
"但事实是，他们都知道，她并不经常大笑；这并不真的是个习惯。自打他们见面那天起，也就是从那一刻开始，雷吉就千方百计地想弄明白，究竟因为什么安妮总是笑他。为什么呢？无论他们是在什么地方或是正在讨论什么事情。可能刚开始的时候他们尽可能严肃，非常严肃——不管怎样，最起码就他而言——但突然，正说着某句话时，安妮就会盯着他，脸上皮肤很快地颤动一下。她的嘴唇咧开，眼睛忽闪着，接着她就开始笑起来。","But the truth was, and they both knew it, she wasn’t always laughing; it wasn’t really a habit.Only ever since the day they’d met, ever since that very first moment, for some strange reason that Reggie wished to God he understood, Anne had laughed at him.Why?It didn’t matter where they were or what they were talking about.They might begin by being as serious as possible, dead serious—at any rate, as far as he was concerned—but then suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, Anne would glance at him, and a little quick quiver passed over her face.Her lips parted, her eyes danced, and she began laughing."
"另外一件奇怪的事是，雷吉觉得安妮自己都不知道她为什么笑。他看着她转开，皱眉、嘬着双腮、双手合十。但无济于事。即使她嚷着“我也不知道我为什么笑”，她还是会发出那长长的、温柔的笑声。这真是个谜……","Another queer thing about it was, Reggie had an idea she didn’t herself know why she laughed.He had seen her turn away, frown, suck in her cheeks, press her hands together.But it was no use.The long, soft peal sounded, even while she cried, “I don’t know why I’m laughing.”It was a mystery..."
"接着她又把手绢塞了回去。","Now she tucked the handkerchief away."
"“请坐。”她说。“抽支烟吧！你旁边的那个小盒子里面有烟。我也来一支。”他为她划了根火柴。她向前探时，他看到小小的火焰在她手上的珍珠戒指上闪着光。“你明天就走，是吗？”安妮问道。“是的，明天就走。”雷吉说着，吐出一小片扇形的烟雾。他究竟为什么这么紧张呢？“紧张”这个词又不确切。","“Do sit down,” said she.“And smoke, won’t you?There are cigarettes in that little box beside you.I’ll have one too.”He lighted a match for her, and as she bent forward he saw the tiny flame glow in the pearl ring she wore.“It is tomorrow that you’re going, isn’t it?” said Anne.“Yes, tomorrow as ever was,” said Reggie, and he blew a little fan of smoke.Why on earth was he so nervous?Nervous wasn’t the word for it."
"“真是——真是难以置信啊！”他又说道。","“It’s—it’s frightfully hard to believe,” he added."
"“是啊——不是吗？”安妮轻声说着。她向前探着，在绿烟灰缸上捻着烟头。她那副模样看起来多美啊！——真美——她在那把大椅子里显得更加小巧。雷金纳德的心充满了温情，但她的话语，她那温柔的话语又使他战栗起来。“我觉得你来这儿很多年了。”她说。","“Yes—isn’t it?” said Anne softly, and she leaned forward and rolled the point of her cigarette round the green ash-tray.How beautiful she looked like that!—simply beautiful—and she was so small in that immense chair.Reginald’s heart swelled with tenderness, but it was her voice, her soft voice, that made him tremble.“I feel you’ve been here for years,” she said."
"雷金纳德使劲吸了一口烟。“想到就要回去了，真是讨厌。”他说。","Reginald took a deep breath of his cigarette.“It’s ghastly, this idea of going back,” he said."
"“咕－噜－咕－咕－咕。”叫声从寂静中传来。","“Coo—roo—coo—coo—coo,” sounded from the quiet."
"“可你喜欢离家在外，是吗？”安妮问道。她手指钩着珍珠项链玩弄着。“那天晚上我父亲还说你能过自己的生活是多么幸运啊。”她抬起头看看他。雷金纳德的笑容很苍白。“我倒不觉得多么幸运。”他轻声说道。","“But you’re fond of being out there, aren’t you?” said Anne.She hooked her finger through her pearl necklace.“Father was saying only the other night how lucky he thought you were to have a life of your own.”And she looked up at him.Reginald’s smile was rather wan.“I don’t feel fearfully lucky,” he said lightly."
"“噜－咕－咕－咕。”叫声再次传来。安妮喃喃地说：“你是说寂寞吧？”","“Roo—coo—coo—coo,” came again.And Anne murmured, “You mean it’s lonely.”"
"“噢，我倒不在乎是否寂寞，”雷金纳德说着，用力地在绿烟灰缸上捻着香烟。“我可以忍受任何寂寞，甚至过去我还很喜欢寂寞。只是一想到——”突然，他吃惊地发现自己脸红了。","“Oh, it isn’t the loneliness I care about,” said Reginald, and he stumped his cigarette savagely on the green ash-tray.“I could stand any amount of it, used to like it even.It’s the idea of—” Suddenly, to his horror, he felt himself blushing."
"“噜－咕－咕－咕！噜－咕－咕－咕！”","“Roo—coo—coo—coo!Roo—coo—coo—coo!”"
"安妮跳起来。“来和我的鸽子说声再见吧。”她说，“它们被挪到旁边阳台上去了。你喜欢鸽子，是吧，雷吉？”","Anne jumped up.“Come and say good-bye to my doves,” she said.“They’ve been moved to the side veranda.You do like doves, don’t you, Reggie?”"
"“非常喜欢。”雷吉说。他的语气如此热情以至于当他为安妮打开落地窗并站到一旁时，她向前跑去，竟对着鸽子笑起来。","“Awfully,” said Reggie, so fervently that as he opened the French window for her and stood to one side, Anne ran forward and laughed at the doves instead."
"两只鸽子在鸽笼里的红色细沙地上来来回回地走动着。一只总是在另一只的前面。一只向前跑去，低声叫着。另一只尾随其后，不住地庄严点头。“看啊，”安妮解释说，“前面那只是鸽子太太。她看着鸽子先生，冲他浅浅一笑就向前跑去；它跟着她，不住地点头。这使她又笑起来。她又跑开了，在她身后，”安妮叫着，坐在自己脚踝上，“跟着可怜的鸽子先生，不住地点头……这就是它们全部的生活。它们别的什么都不做，就是这样。”她站起来，从鸽笼顶上的一个袋子里拿了些黄色谷粒出来。“当你在罗得西亚想起他们，雷吉，你可以完全相信，他们还是做着同样的事情……”","To and fro, to and fro over the fine red sand on the floor of the dove house, walked the two doves.One was always in front of the other.One ran forward, uttering a little cry, and the other followed, solemnly bowing and bowing.“You see,” explained Anne, “the one in front, she’s Mrs. Dove.She looks at Mr. Dove and gives that little laugh and runs forward, and he follows her, bowing and bowing.And that makes her laugh again.Away she runs, and after her,” cried Anne, and she sat back on her heels, “comes poor Mr. Dove, bowing and bowing... and that’s their whole life.They never do anything else, you know.”She got up and took some yellow grains out of a bag on the roof of the dove house.“When you think of them, out in Rhodesia, Reggie, you can be sure that is what they will be doing... ”"
"雷吉没什么反应，就像没看到鸽子，也没听进去任何话语。在那一瞬间，他只想着怎样努力敞开心扉，告诉安妮自己心中的秘密。“安妮，你觉得你会喜欢我吗？”终于说出口了。总算结束了。在接下来短暂的沉默中，雷金纳德看着阳光下的花园，跳跃的蓝色天空，阳台柱子上晃动的树叶，还有安妮用一根手指拨弄着手掌里的玉米粒。接着，她慢慢地攥起拳头，咕哝道：“不，永远不会那样。”雷吉的新世界也一下子暗淡下来。他还没来得及想一下，她已经快速走开了。他跟着她走下台阶，沿着花园的小路，穿过粉红玫瑰拱门，越过草坪。背对着花园边缘上绚烂的绿草带，安妮转身面对着雷金纳德。“不是我不太喜欢你，”她说，“我喜欢。但是”——她的眼睛睁得大大的——“不是那种喜欢”——她的脸蛋微微动了一下——“一个人应该喜欢——”她的嘴唇张开，又无法控制自己了。她开始笑起来。“你看，你看，”她嚷道，“都是因为你的方格领——领带。即使是在这种场合，当人们真觉得应该庄重的时候，你的领带还是让我忍不住想起画里猫咪戴的蝴蝶结！噢，请原谅我如此讨厌，很抱歉！”","Reggie gave no sign of having seen the doves or of having heard a word.For the moment he was conscious only of the immense effort it took to tear his secret out of himself and offer it to Anne.“Anne, do you think you could ever care for me?”It was done.It was over.And in the little pause that followed Reginald saw the garden open to the light, the blue quivering sky, the flutter of leaves on the veranda poles, and Anne turning over the grains of maize on her palm with one finger.Then slowly she shut her hand, and the new world faded as she murmured slowly, “No, never in that way.”But he had scarcely time to feel anything before she walked quickly away, and he followed her down the steps, along the garden path, under the pink rose arches, across the lawn.There, with the gay herbaceous border behind her, Anne faced Reginald.“It isn’t that I’m not awfully fond of you,” she said.“I am.But”—her eyes widened—“not in the way”—a quiver passed over her face—“one ought to be fond of—” Her lips parted, and she couldn’t stop herself.She began laughing.“There, you see, you see,” she cried, “it’s your check t—tie.Even at this moment, when one would think one really would be solemn, your tie reminds me fearfully of the bow-tie that cats wear in pictures!Oh, please forgive me for being so horrid, please!”"
"雷吉紧紧握住她温暖的小手。“没什么原谅不原谅的。”他赶紧说。“怎么会提到原谅呢？我明白我为何让你笑的。这是因为你各方面都比我高贵得多，所以我看起来有些滑稽。我明白，安妮。但是如果我以后——”","Reggie caught hold of her little warm hand.“There’s no question of forgiving you,” he said quickly.“How could there be?And I do believe I know why I make you laugh.It’s because you’re so far above me in every way that I am somehow ridiculous.I see that, Anne.But if I were to—”"
"“不，不。”安妮用力攥着他的手。“不是这样。全错了。我一点都不比你高贵。你比我好得多。你一点儿都不自私，而且……而且善良、单纯。这些东西我都没有。你不了解我。我脾性最糟糕了。”安妮说。“请别打断我。而且，问题不在这儿。问题是”——她摇摇头——“我不可能嫁给一个我取笑的人。这个你当然明白。我要嫁的人——”安妮轻轻喘息道。她说不下去了。她抽出手，看着雷吉，奇怪地、梦游般地笑着。“我要嫁的人——”","“No, no.”Anne squeezed his hand hard.“It’s not that.That’s all wrong.I’m not far above you at all.You’re much better than I am.You’re marvellously unselfish and... and kind and simple.I’m none of those things.You don’t know me.I’m the most awful character,” said Anne.“Please don’t interrupt.And besides, that’s not the point.The point is”—she shook her head—“I couldn’t possibly marry a man I laughed at.Surely you see that.The man I marry—” breathed Anne softly.She broke off.She drew her hand away, and looking at Reggie she smiled strangely, dreamily.“The man I marry—”"
"雷吉仿佛看见一个高大英俊、才华横溢的陌生人走到他面前，取代了他的位置——就是安妮和他曾在剧院里常看到的那种男人，不知从哪里走到舞台上，一言不发就将女主角搂入怀中，长久、可怕地注视后又把她带走，不知去向何处……","And it seemed to Reggie that a tall, handsome, brilliant stranger stepped in front of him and took his place—the kind of man that Anne and he had seen often at the theatre, walking on to the stage from nowhere, without a word catching the heroine in his arms, and after one long, tremendous look, carrying her off to anywhere..."
"雷吉冲着他的幻想点着头。“是这样，我明白了。”他声音嘶哑地说。","Reggie bowed to his vision.“Yes, I see,” he said huskily."
"“你明白了？”","“Do you?” said Anne."
"“噢，我真希望你能明白。因为对此我很是恐慌。这很难解释。你知道我从未——”她停下不说了。雷吉看着她。她在微笑。“这不好笑吗？”她说，","“Oh, I do hope you do.Because I feel so horrid about it.It’s so hard to explain.You know I’ve never—” She stopped.Reggie looked at her.She was smiling.“Isn’t it funny?” she said."
"“我什么都能讲给你听。从一开始我就能。”","“I can say anything to you.I always have been able to from the very beginning.”"
"他试着微笑着说“我很高兴。”她接着往下说。“我从未像喜欢你一样喜欢别人。与别人相处，我从未如此高兴。但我确定这并不是人们或书上所说的爱情。你明白吗？噢，要是你明白我心里多害怕就好了。可我们应该像……像鸽子先生和鸽子太太那样。”","He tried to smile, to say “I’m glad.”She went on.“I’ve never known any one I like as much as I like you.I’ve never felt so happy with any one.But I’m sure it’s not what people and what books mean when they talk about love.Do you understand?Oh, if you only knew how horrid I feel.But we’d be like... like Mr. and Mrs. Dove.”"
"这下子全明白了。对雷金纳德来说似乎就是最终宣判了。它是如此真实，他几乎不能忍受。“别把它说破了。”他说。他转过身，望向草坪。那边是园丁的茅舍，旁边是株郁郁葱葱的冬青树。烟囱上空飘浮着一缕拇指粗细的湿润、蓝色、透明的烟雾。看起来不像是真的。他的喉咙好痛！他能说话吗？他试了试。“我得回家了。”他声音沙哑地说。他开始穿过草坪。安妮在后面追着他。“不，不要。你还不能走。”她恳求道。“你这种心情可不能走。”她抬头盯着他，皱着眉，咬着嘴唇。","That did it.That seemed to Reginald final, and so terribly true that he could hardly bear it.“Don’t drive it home,” he said, and he turned away from Anne and looked across the lawn.There was the gardener’s cottage, with the dark ilex-tree beside it.A wet, blue thumb of transparent smoke hung above the chimney.It didn’t look real.How his throat ached!Could he speak?He had a shot.“I must be getting along home,” he croaked, and he began walking across the lawn.But Anne ran after him.“No, don’t.You can’t go yet,” she said imploringly.“You can’t possibly go away feeling like that.”And she stared up at him frowning, biting her lip."
"“噢，没什么，”雷吉说，为了帮自己解脱。“我会……我会——”他挥着手，像是说“挺过去的。”","“Oh, that’s all right,” said Reggie, giving himself a shake.“I’ll... I’ll—” And he waved his hand as much to say “get over it.”"
"“可是这太糟糕了。”安妮说。她十指交叉紧握，站在他面前。“你肯定明白如果我俩结婚结果会很糟，是吧？”","“But this is awful,” said Anne.She clasped her hands and stood in front of him.“Surely you do see how fatal it would be for us to marry, don’t you?”"
"“嗯，是啊，是啊。”雷吉说，无精打采地看着她。","“Oh, quite, quite,” said Reggie, looking at her with haggard eyes."
"“我这样想太不对，太可恶了。我是说，对鸽子先生和鸽子太太来说，这还挺好的。可想想在现实生活中——想想吧！”","“How wrong, how wicked, feeling as I do.I mean, it’s all very well for Mr. and Mrs. Dove.But imagine that in real life—imagine it!”"
"“哦，当然。”雷吉说着，开始继续朝前走。但安妮再次截住他。她拉着他的袖子，使他意外的是，这次她没笑，倒像是个要哭的小女孩。","“Oh, absolutely,” said Reggie, and he started to walk on.But again Anne stopped him.She tugged at his sleeve, and to his astonishment, this time, instead of laughing, she looked like a little girl who was going to cry."
"“如果你明白的话，那么为什么你这么这么不高兴？”她声音呜咽道。“你为何如此介意？你为什么看起来这么——这么难过？”","“Then why, if you understand, are you so ununhappy?” she wailed.“Why do you mind so fearfully?Why do you look so aw—awful?”"
"雷吉哽咽了，他又挥着手，不愿再继续。“我忍不住，”他说，“我受到了打击。如果我现在快点儿离开，我就会——”","Reggie gulped, and again he waved something away.“I can’t help it,” he said, “I’ve had a blow.If I cut off now, I’ll be able to—”"
"“你怎么能说现在快点儿离开呢？”安妮挖苦道。她冲雷吉跺着脚；脸变得通红。“你怎么这么无情？除非我确定你和你要我嫁给你之前一样快乐，不然的话我是不会让你走的。你肯定明白这个，这太简单不过了。”","“How can you talk of cutting off now?” said Anne scornfully.She stamped her foot at Reggie; she was crimson.“How can you be so cruel?I can’t let you go until I know for certain that you are just as happy as you were before you asked me to marry you.Surely you must see that, it’s so simple.”"
"但这对于雷金纳德来说可一点都不简单。看起来这还非常难办。","But it did not seem at all simple to Reginald.It seemed impossibly difficult."
"“即使我不能嫁给你，可你要去那么远，只能给你那难过的妈妈写信，你是那样的可怜，而这一切都是我的过错，我该怎么办呢？”","“Even if I can’t marry you, how can I know that you’re all that way away, with only that awful mother to write to, and that you’re miserable, and that it’s all my fault?”"
"“这不是你的错。别这样想。这就是命。”雷吉把她的手从自己衣袖上拿开亲吻着。“不要可怜我，亲爱的小安妮。”他温柔地说。这次他几乎是跑着离开了，穿过粉色拱门，沿着花园的小路就这样跑开了。","“It’s not your fault.Don’t think that.It’s just fate.”Reggie took her hand off his sleeve and kissed it.“Don’t pity me, dear little Anne,” he said gently.And this time he nearly ran, under the pink arches, along the garden path."
"“噜－咕－咕－咕！噜－咕－咕－咕！”从走廊传来叫声。“雷吉，雷吉，”呼喊声从花园那边传来。","“Roo—coo—coo—coo!Roo—coo—coo—coo!”sounded from the veranda.“Reggie, Reggie,” from the garden."
"他停下脚步，转过身。但当她看到他胆怯而迷惑的表情时，又低声笑了。","He stopped, he turned.But when she saw his timid, puzzled look, she gave a little laugh."
"“回来吧，鸽子先生。”安妮说。雷金纳德缓缓地穿过草坪走了回来。","“Come back, Mr. Dove,” said Anne.And Reginald came slowly across the lawn."
