"作者：杰克·伦敦","by Jack London"
"开电梯的男孩兀自会意地笑了。当他启动电梯带她上去的时候，他注意到了她眼里的火花和脸颊上的红晕。她压抑着的热切让他那小小的电梯厢变得温暖起来。现在，电梯下行了，冷如冰川。火花和红晕都消失了。她皱着眉，他在她的眼睛里看到的是冷漠和铁灰色。哦，他知道这些症状，他确实知道。作为观察者，他也知道这一点，而且可以确信的是，将来的某一天，等他年纪足够大了，他会成为一名记者。与此同时，当他的生命随着升降梯在这十八层摩天大楼里上上下下地度过时，他也在体会了生命的历程。他同情地为她打开电梯门，看着她迈着坚定的步伐走向大街。","The elevator boy smiled knowingly to himself.When he took her up, he had noted the sparkle in her eyes, the color in her cheeks.His little cage had quite warmed with the glow of her repressed eagerness.And now, on the down trip, it was glacier-like.The sparkle and the color were gone.She was frowning, and what little he could see of her eyes was cold and steel-gray.Oh, he knew the symptoms, he did.He was an observer, and he knew it, too, and some day, when he was big enough, he was going to be a reporter, sure.And in the meantime he studied the procession of life as it streamed up and down eighteen sky-scraper floors in his elevator car.He slid the door open for her sympathetically and watched her trip determinedly out into the street."
"她的举止中有种来自于泥土而非城市的铺路材料的坚定。但是这种坚定比一般意义上的更好，可以称为是一种充满活力的优雅，给人男子气的感觉，毫无女子气息。它讲述的是一种遗传，这种遗传来自探索者和战斗者，来自用头脑和双手顽强工作的人们，来自穿越了朦胧的过去并把她塑造成实干家的幽灵。","There was a robustness in her carriage which came of the soil rather than of the city pavement.But it was a robustness in a finer than the wonted sense, a vigorous daintiness, it might be called, which gave an impression of virility with none of the womanly left out.It told of a heredity of seekers and fighters, of people that worked stoutly with head and hand, of ghosts that reached down out of the misty past and moulded and made her to be a doer of things."
"然而，她有点儿生气，受了很大的伤害。期待已久的面试刚刚结束，面试中编辑友善却又坚定地打断了她那冗长的开场白，说道：“我能猜到接下来你要告诉我什么。”“你已经告诉我很多了，”他继续说道（趁还没忘记，她把这番对话重温了一遍，她确信他是无情的），“你没有干过报社的工作。你未经训练，没有经验，尚未历练成型。你接受过高中教育，可能最后以师范学校或职业学校结束了自己受教育的生涯。你的英语很棒。你所有的朋友都夸你的写作技巧巧妙、用词优美等诸如此类的话。你认为你能胜任报社的工作，你想让我录用你。呃，我很抱歉，但是我们这里没有空缺。要是你知道这儿的人有多么多——”","But she was a little angry, and a great deal hurt.“I can guess what you would tell me,” the editor had kindly but firmly interrupted her lengthy preamble in the long-looked-forward-to interview just ended.“And you have told me enough,” he had gone on (heartlessly, she was sure, as she went over the conversation in its freshness).“You have done no newspaper work.You are undrilled, undisciplined, unhammered into shape.You have received a high-school education, and possibly topped it off with normal school or college.You have stood well in English.Your friends have all told you how cleverly you write, and how beautifully, and so forth and so forth.You think you can do newspaper work, and you want me to put you on.Well, I am sorry, but there are no openings.If you knew how crowded—”"
"“但是，要是没有空缺，”她反过来打断了他的话，“那些在里面工作的人是怎么进来的？我要怎么证明我有资格被录取呢？”","“But if there are no openings,” she had interrupted, in turn, “how did those who are in, get in?How am I to show that I am eligible to get in?”"
"“他们把自己变得不可或缺，”他简要地答道，“把你自己变成不可或缺的。”","“They made themselves indispensable,” was the terse response.“Make yourself indispensable.”"
"“可要是我没有这个机会，我怎样才能做到呢？”","“But how can I, if I do not get the chance?”"
"“创造机会。”","“Make your chance.”"
"“但是怎么做呢？”她坚持问，同时暗自认定他是一个极其不可理喻的人。","“But how?” she had insisted, at the same time privately deeming him a most unreasonable man."
"“怎么做？这是你的事，不是我的。”他下了最后的结论，站了起来，这也意味着面试结束了。“亲爱的小姐，我必须告诉你，这周已经至少有十八个有抱负的年轻小姐来这儿，我没有时间去一一告诉她们怎么做。我在这家报社的作用可不同于新闻学院的导师。”","“How?That is your business, not mine,” he said conclusively, rising in token that the interview was at an end.“I must inform you, my dear young lady, that there have been at least eighteen other aspiring young ladies here this week, and that I have not the time to tell each and every one of them how.The function I perform on this paper is hardly that of instructor in a school of journalism.”"
"她上了一辆离开这的车，在车上，她一直反反复复地回味研究他们之间的对话。“但是怎么做呢？”她边反复着自言自语，边上了三节楼梯来到她和姐姐“独自生活”的房间。“但是怎么做呢？”她依然盘算着这个疑问，尽管她常常离开苏格兰本土，那苏格兰血统里的执拗劲儿在她身上表现得依然很明显。更进一步说，她学习怎么去做是有必要的。她和姐姐莱蒂都是从内地城镇来到城里，要创造出一片自己的天地。约翰·怀曼有地无钱。损失惨重的工商企业加重了他的土地的负担，迫使他的两个女儿——埃德娜和莱蒂，去自谋出路。一年的学校教育以及利用晚上时间学习的速记和打字为她们的进城计划提供了资本，也让她们作好了冒险的准备，虽然类似的冒险往往是不成功的。这个城市似乎挤满了缺乏经验的速记员和打字员，他们除了能提供少得可怜的经验之外，一无所有。埃德娜曾经暗自立下的志向是从事新闻工作，但她计划从文书工作做起，这样她就能有时间和空间来决定她以后将在哪里从事什么类型的新闻工作。但是文书的职位不是说有就有的，无论是对莱蒂还是对她来说，她们为数不多的积蓄在一天一天地变少，而房子的租金却没变，炉子里的煤烧的速度也没有减缓。现在就只剩一点点积蓄了。","She caught an outbound car, and ere she descended from it she had conned the conversation over and over again.“But how?” she repeated to herself, as she climbed the three flights of stairs to the rooms where she and her sister “bach’ed.”“But how?”And so she continued to put the interrogation, for the stubborn Scotch blood, though many times removed from Scottish soil, was still strong in her.And, further, there was need that she should learn how.Her sister Letty and she had come up from an interior town to the city to make their way in the world.John Wyman was land-poor.Disastrous business enterprises had burdened his acres and forced his two girls, Edna and Letty, into doing something for themselves.A year of school-teaching and of night-study of shorthand and typewriting had capitalized their city project and fitted them for the venture, which same venture was turning out anything but successful.The city seemed crowded with inexperienced stenographers and typewriters, and they had nothing but their own inexperience to offer.Edna’s secret ambition had been journalism; but she had planned a clerical position first, so that she might have time and space in which to determine where and on what line of journalism she would embark.But the clerical position had not been forthcoming, either for Letty or her, and day by day their little hoard dwindled, though the room rent remained normal and the stove consumed coal with undiminished voracity.And it was a slim little hoard by now."
"“有一个叫马克斯·欧文的人，”莱蒂商量着说，“他是一个闻名全国的记者。去见见他，埃德。他知道怎么做，他应该能告诉你怎么做。”","“There’s Max Irwin,” Letty said, talking it over.“He’s a journalist with a national reputation.Go and see him, Ed.He knows how, and he should be able to tell you how.”"
"“可我不认识他。”埃德娜反驳道。","“But I don’t know him,” Edna objected."
"“你今天见的那个编辑你也一样不认识啊。”","“No more than you knew the editor you saw to-day.”"
"“是——的，”埃德娜拖长声音判断着说，“可那不一样啊。”","“Y-e-s,” (long and judicially), “but that’s different.”"
"“等你学会怎么做之后，他就和你采访的陌生男女没什么两样。”莱蒂鼓励道。","“Not a bit different from the strange men and women you’ll interview when you’ve learned how,” Letty encouraged."
"“我之前从来没有这样看待过这件事，”埃德娜让步了，“毕竟，为了某报社采访马克斯·欧文先生，和为了我自己采访他，有什么不同呢？这也算是一次实践。我去姓名地址录里查找他。”","“I hadn’t looked at it in that light,” Edna conceded.“After all, where’s the difference between, interviewing Mr. Max Irwin for some paper, or interviewing Mr. Max Irwin for myself?It will be practice, too.I’ll go and look him up in the directory.”"
"“莱蒂，我知道，如果有机会的话，我能写出来，”过了一会儿她坚定地宣称，“我就是觉得我有这种感觉，如果你明白我在说什么。”","“Letty, I know I can write if I get the chance,” she announced decisively a moment later.“I just FEEL that I have the feel of it, if you know what I mean.”"
"莱蒂明白，她点了点头。“我在想，他长什么样子呢？”她轻声问道。","And Letty knew and nodded.“I wonder what he is like?” she asked softly."
"“我会把它当成我自己的事去探个究竟，”埃德娜向她保证说，“我会让你在48小时之内知道。”","“I’ll make it my business to find out,” Edna assured her; “and I’ll let you know inside forty-eight hours.”"
"莱蒂鼓了鼓掌。“好样的！这才是报社的精神！在24小时之内搞定，你就是最棒的！”","Letty clapped her hands.“Good!That’s the newspaper spirit!Make it twenty-four hours and you are perfect!”"
"“——很抱歉，打扰您了。”她向马克斯·欧文——有名的战地记者兼经验丰富的新闻记者——结束自己的情况陈述。","“—and I am very sorry to trouble you,” she concluded the statement of her case to Max Irwin, famous war correspondent and veteran journalist."
"“不用客气。”他回答说，不赞成地摆了摆手。“要是你都不为自己说话，又有谁来为你说话呢？现在我特别理解你的窘境。你想去《情报员》报纸工作，你想立刻进去工作，但是你先前没有经验。首先，你有什么门路吗？在这座城市，有很多人，从他们那得到一则消息就等同于拿到一块敲门砖。在这之后，你就要凭借自己的能力，要么站稳脚跟，要么失败。例如，有一个叫朗布里奇的参议员，也有个叫克劳斯·英斯基普的有轨电车巨头，还有莱恩和麦克切斯尼——”他停了下来，顿了顿声音。","“Not at all,” he answered, with a deprecatory wave of the hand.“If you don’t do your own talking, who’s to do it for you?Now I understand your predicament precisely.You want to get on the INTELLIGENCER, you want to get in at once, and you have had no previous experience.In the first place, then, have you any pull?There are a dozen men in the city, a line from whom would be an open-sesame.After that you would stand or fall by your own ability.There’s Senator Longbridge, for instance, and Claus Inskeep the street-car magnate, and Lane, and McChesney—” He paused, with voice suspended."
"“我确定，他们我一个也不认识。”她沮丧地回答道。","“I am sure I know none of them,” she answered despondently."
"“这不要紧。你认识的人中有认识他们的吗？或者，那些人认识其他认识他们的人吗？”","“It’s not necessary.Do you know any one that knows them? or any one that knows any one else that knows them?”"
"埃德娜摇了摇头。","Edna shook her head."
"“那么我们必须想想其他的办法了，”他高兴地继续说，“你必须靠自己去做一些事。让我想想。”","“Then we must think of something else,” he went on, cheerfully.“You’ll have to do something yourself.Let me see.”"
"他停了下来，闭上眼睛，皱起额头，想了一会儿。当他那双蓝眼睛啪嗒一下睁开，脸上突然焕发光彩时，她正在看着他，出神地观察他。","He stopped and thought for a moment, with closed eyes and wrinkled forehead.She was watching him, studying him intently, when his blue eyes opened with a snap and his face suddenly brightened."
"“我有主意了！不过不行，等一下。”这一会儿，轮到他来研究她了。他仔细观察她，直到在他的凝视下，她感到自己的脸颊变得通红。","“I have it!But no, wait a minute.”And for a minute it was his turn to study her.And study her he did, till she could feel her cheeks flushing under his gaze."
"“你能行，我觉得，尽管这还有待观察，”他神秘地说，“这将展示出你身上的才华，另外，博得《情报员》读者的认可要比拥有世界上各领域所有参议员和巨头的支持要好得多。你要做的事情就是在卢布斯做业余爱好者之夜。”","“You’ll do, I think, though it remains to be seen,” he said enigmatically.“It will show the stuff that’s in you, besides, and it will be a better claim upon the INTELLIGENCER people than all the lines from all the senators and magnates in the world.The thing for you is to do Amateur Night at the Loops.”"
"“我——我不太明白，”埃德娜说，因为他的提议没有传达给埃德娜任何信息。“什么‘卢布斯’？什么‘业余爱好者之夜’？”","“I—I hardly understand,” Edna said, for his suggestion conveyed no meaning to her.“What are the ‘Loops’? and what is ‘Amateur Night’?”"
"“我忘了你说过你来自内地省。但是，如果你只想从事新闻行业，知道这么多就好了。这将会是第一印象，第一印象通常都是不带任何偏见的，公平的，新鲜而又生动的。卢布斯在城市的边缘，靠近公园——一个娱乐场所。那有一条风景甚好的铁路，一条雪橇滑水道，一个音乐会乐队，一家剧院，野生动物，电影，等等等等。一般人去那儿观赏动物自娱自乐，其他人去那以看其他普通人玩得开心来得到乐趣。一个民主的、可以呼吸新鲜空气的、嬉闹玩耍的地方，这就是卢布斯。","“I forgot you said you were from the interior.But so much the better, if you’ve only got the journalistic grip.It will be a first impression, and first impressions are always unbiased, unprejudiced, fresh, vivid.The Loops are out on the rim of the city, near the Park,—a place of diversion.There’s a scenic railway, a water toboggan slide, a concert band, a theatre, wild animals, moving pictures, and so forth and so forth.The common people go there to look at the animals and enjoy themselves, and the other people go there to enjoy themselves by watching the common people enjoy themselves.A democratic, fresh-air-breathing, frolicking affair, that’s what the Loops are."
"“但是与你有关的是那家剧院。那里有歌舞杂耍表演。演出者一个接一个——变戏法的、演杂技的、橡胶做成的奇观、火舞者、黑人音乐家、歌手、演奏者、男扮女装的演员、多愁善感的独奏者，等等等等。这些人都是专业的歌舞杂耍演员。他们靠演出维持生活。很多人收入不错。有一些是自由的巡演者，无论在哪里，只要有空缺，他们都会演个节目，比如在奥贝曼、在奥菲斯、在阿尔卡特拉兹、在卢浮宫，等等等等。其他人很擅长在这个国家巡回演出。这是一段有趣的人生，而且酬劳也足够多，吸引了很多有志青年。","“But the theatre is what concerns you.It’s vaudeville.One turn follows another—jugglers, acrobats, rubber-jointed wonders, fire-dancers, coon-song artists, singers, players, female impersonators, sentimental soloists, and so forth and so forth.These people are professional vaudevillists.They make their living that way.Many are excellently paid.Some are free rovers, doing a turn wherever they can get an opening, at the Obermann, the Orpheus, the Alcatraz, the Louvre, and so forth and so forth.Others cover circuit pretty well all over the country.An interesting phase of life, and the pay is big enough to attract many aspirants."
"“为了获得名气，现在卢布斯的管理者创立了‘业余爱好者之夜’；也就是说，每周两次，在专业人员表演完之后，舞台就让给了有抱负的业余爱好者。观众可以加以评论。大众成为了艺术的裁决者——或者说他们自己认为如此，这两者是一样的。大众花钱来消费，并且深感满意。业余爱好者之夜对于管理层而言是一个能带来利润的提议。","“Now the management of the Loops, in its bid for popularity, instituted what is called ‘Amateur Night’; that is to say, twice a week, after the professionals have done their turns, the stage is given over to the aspiring amateurs.The audience remains to criticise.The populace becomes the arbiter of art—or it thinks it does, which is the same thing; and it pays its money and is well pleased with itself, and Amateur Night is a paying proposition to the management."
"“不过业余爱好者之夜的重点，很有必要指出这一点，就是那些业余爱好者不是真的业余爱好者。他们靠表演来获得酬劳。他们充其量可以被称为‘专业的业余爱好者’。合乎情理的是，管理者不会让他们一无所获地去面对一群不受约束的观众。在这种情况下，观众也肯定会疯狂的。这很有趣——对观众来说。但是你要做的事就是，这需要勇气，我向你保证，外出交际，安排两场演出（我认为应在星期三和星期六晚上），你来表演，然后写出来登在《周日情报员》。","“But the point of Amateur Night, and it is well to note it, is that these amateurs are not really amateurs.They are paid for doing their turn.At the best, they may be termed ‘professional amateurs.’ It stands to reason that the management could not get people to face a rampant audience for nothing, and on such occasions the audience certainly goes mad.It’s great fun—for the audience.But the thing for you to do, and it requires nerve, I assure you, is to go out, make arrangements for two turns, (Wednesday and Saturday nights, I believe), do your two turns, and write it up for the Sunday Intelligencer.”"
"“但是——但是，”她颤抖着说，“我——我——”那声音里透出了失望和伤心。","“But—but,” she quavered, “I—I—” and there was a suggestion of disappointment and tears in her voice."
"“我明白，”他善意地说，“你期待的是其他东西，一些不同的、更好的东西。我们开始都这样。但是请你记住纳威王后的海军上将，他扫过地，擦过大前门的手柄。你必须面对做学徒的辛苦单调，否则你现在就退出。你说呢？”","“I see,” he said kindly.“You were expecting something else, something different, something better.We all do at first.But remember the admiral of the Queen’s Na-vee, who swept the floor and polished up the handle of the big front door.You must face the drudgery of apprenticeship or quit right now.What do you say?”"
"他要求她立刻作出决定，这令她吃了一惊。她犹豫了，这时她看出他的脸色开始阴沉起来。","The abruptness with which he demanded her decision startled her.As she faltered, she could see a shade of disappointment beginning to darken his face."
"“在一定程度上，它也被认为是一次测试，”他接着鼓励道，“一次严格的测试，但是这样更好。现在是时候了。你有勇气吗？”","“In a way it must be considered a test,” he added encouragingly.“A severe one, but so much the better.Now is the time.Are you game?”"
"“我会试一试。”她懦弱地说，同时，她记下了她要接触的那些城市男人们的直接、鲁莽和匆忙。","“I’ll try,” she said faintly, at the same time making a note of the directness, abruptness, and haste of these city men with whom she was coming in contact."
"“好！过去我开始的时候，我的任务都是能想象到的最枯燥、最致命的任务。在这之后，我过了一段令人厌烦的生活。我当过警察，还因离婚上过法庭。但是最后一切都好起来了，并且对我也有好处。你幸运得多，从《周日情报员》的工作做起。这还不是特别好的。那又怎么样？去行动吧。展示你自己的才能，你将会获得一个更好的工作——更高的阶层和更多的薪水。今天下午你去卢布斯，做两场表演。”","“Good!Why, when I started in, I had the dreariest, deadliest details imaginable.And after that, for a weary time, I did the police and divorce courts.But it all came well in the end and did me good.You are luckier in making your start with Sunday work.It’s not particularly great.What of it?Do it.Show the stuff you’re made of, and you’ll get a call for better work—better class and better pay.Now you go out this afternoon to the Loops, and engage to do two turns.”"
"“但是我能做什么样的表演呢？”埃德娜怀疑地问。","“But what kind of turns can I do?” Edna asked dubiously."
"“做什么？很简单。你会唱歌吗？没关系，没必要唱歌。尖叫大喊，什么事情都可以——你能用来赚钱的事，给大众提供娱乐以及让他们喊叫着轰下台的拙劣艺术。当你表演的时候，带上个人作陪同。不要害怕任何人。大胆地讲。在那些等着表演的业余爱好者中走走、追问他们、研究他们、在你的脑海里留下他们的印象。了解其气氛、色彩、浓重的色彩，还有很多。用双手深入挖掘，了解其本质、灵魂和意义。那是什么意思呢？搞清楚那是什么意思。那就是你为什么在卢布斯的原因。那就是《周日情报员》的读者想要知道的。","“Do?That’s easy.Can you sing?Never mind, don’t need to sing.Screech, do anything—that’s what you’re paid for, to afford amusement, to give bad art for the populace to howl down.And when you do your turn, take some one along for chaperon.Be afraid of no one.Talk up.Move about among the amateurs waiting their turn, pump them, study them, photograph them in your brain.Get the atmosphere, the color, strong color, lots of it.Dig right in with both hands, and get the essence of it, the spirit, the significance.What does it mean?Find out what it means.That’s what you’re there for.That’s what the readers of the Sunday Intelligencer want to know."
"“文字的风格要简洁，用词要有力，比喻要恰当、确实恰当。避免陈词滥调和老生常谈。用心挑选。抓住突出部分，忽略剩余的东西，你还要有图片。用文字来描绘图片，那样《情报员》会雇用你。找到以前的几期，研究一下《周日情报员》的专题报道。在首段要交代所有事情，以此作为内容预告，在内容段里再把事情重说一遍。然后把快照附在最后，这样如果版面不足，他们可以删掉你文章内容的任何部分，重新附上快照。这样故事会保留框架。好啦，这就足够了。其余的自己研究一下吧。”","“Be terse in style, vigorous of phrase, apt, concretely apt, in similitude.Avoid platitudes and commonplaces.Exercise selection.Seize upon things salient, eliminate the rest, and you have pictures.Paint those pictures in words and the Intelligencer will have you.Get hold of a few back numbers, and study the Sunday Intelligencer feature story.Tell it all in the opening paragraph as advertisement of contents, and in the contents tell it all over again.Then put a snapper at the end, so if they’re crowded for space they can cut off your contents anywhere, reattach the snapper, and the story will still retain form.There, that’s enough.Study the rest out for yourself.”"
"他们两个站了起来，他的热情令埃德娜着迷，他那快速、断续的话语中充满了她想了解的种种事情。","They both rose to their feet, Edna quite carried away by his enthusiasm and his quick, jerky sentences, bristling with the things she wanted to know."
"“记住，怀曼小姐，如果你有抱负的话，新闻工作的目标不是专题报道。避免老一套。专题报道是一个技巧。掌控它，别让它掌控你。但是，你必须掌控它，因为如果你学不会怎么作好专题报道，你就别指望做好任何事。总之，如果你听明白了我的话，就全身心地投入其中，不过，又要在这之外，在这之上，保持自我。现在，祝你好运。”","“And remember, Miss Wyman, if you’re ambitious, that the aim and end of journalism is not the feature article.Avoid the rut.The feature is a trick.Master it, but don’t let it master you.But master it you must; for if you can’t learn to do a feature well, you can never expect to do anything better.In short, put your whole self into it, and yet, outside of it, above it, remain yourself, if you follow me.And now good luck to you.”"
"他们走到门口，握了握手。","They had reached the door and were shaking hands."
"“还有一件事情，”他打断了她的感谢，“在你把稿子交上去之前，让我先看看。或许我能帮你稍加修改一下。”","“And one thing more,” he interrupted her thanks, “let me see your copy before you turn it in.I may be able to put you straight here and there.”"
"埃德娜见到了卢布斯的经理。他胖胖的，下巴很厚，眉毛浓密，通常好斗的神态，漫不经心的愁容挂在脸上，一支黑雪茄叼在嘴里。她已经知道他叫赛姆斯，厄恩斯特·赛姆斯。","Edna found the manager of the Loops a full-fleshed, heavy-jowled man, bushy of eyebrow and generally belligerent of aspect, with an absent-minded scowl on his face and a black cigar stuck in the midst thereof.Symes was his name, she had learned, Ernst Symes."
"她简短的申请还没说到一半，他就问道：“谁表演？”","“Whatcher turn?” he demanded, ere half her brief application had left her lips."
"“伤感的独唱演员，女高音。”想起欧文建议她要直截了当，她立刻回答道。","“Sentimental soloist, soprano,” she answered promptly, remembering Irwin’s advice to talk up."
"“叫什么名字？”赛姆斯先生问道，都没屈尊瞧她一眼。","“Whatcher name?”Mr. Symes asked, scarcely deigning to glance at her."
"她犹豫了。她太匆匆投入这件冒险活动，以致于她都没有去想名字的问题。","She hesitated.So rapidly had she been rushed into the adventure that she had not considered the question of a name at all."
"“有什么名字吗？艺名？”他不耐烦地怒吼着说。","“Any name?Stage name?” he bellowed impatiently."
"“南·伯拉派恩，”她一时兴起就编了一个，“伯——拉——派恩。是的，就叫这个。”","“Nan Bellayne,” she invented on the spur of the moment.“B-e-l-l-a-y-n-e.Yes, that’s it.”"
"他潦潦草草地写进一个记事本。“好的。你在星期三和星期六来。”","He scribbled it into a notebook.“All right.Take your turn Wednesday and Saturday.”"
"“我可以赚多少？”埃德娜问。","“How much do I get?” Edna demanded."
"“一次两块五。两次，五块。在第二次演出后的第一个星期一时拿薪水。”","“Two-an’-a-half a turn.Two turns, five.Getcher pay first Monday after second turn.”"
"他都没有礼貌性地简单说一声“再见”，就转身背对过她，投入到她一进门时他正在看的报纸上去了。　","And without the simple courtesy of “Good day,” he turned his back on her and plunged into the newspaper he had been reading when she entered."
"星期三晚上，埃德娜早早就来，莱蒂和她一起来的，在一个可折叠的篮筐里放着她的服装——很简单的行头而已。从洗衣女工那里借来的格子披肩，从打杂女工那里借来的褴褛粗糙的裙子，从顾客那里以25美分一晚的价格租来的斑白假发，这就是她的全套装束；因为他们选埃德娜扮演一个在儿子走失之后唱着伤心的歌的爱尔兰老女人。","Edna came early on Wednesday evening, Letty with her, and in a telescope basket her costume—a simple affair.A plaid shawl borrowed from the washerwoman, a ragged scrubbing skirt borrowed from the charwoman, and a gray wig rented from a costumer for twenty-five cents a night, completed the outfit; for Edna had elected to be an old Irishwoman singing broken-heartedly after her wandering boy."
"虽然她们到得早，她发现到处都很喧闹。主要演出已经开始了，管弦乐队在演奏，观众时不时地鼓掌。业余爱好者的涌入阻碍了幕后工作，过道、化妆间和舞台侧厅里挤满了人，使得每个人都在挡其他人的路。这一点对专业演员来说，特别令人讨厌。他们认为自己适合一个更高的阶层，他们对待低贱的业余爱好者的态度表现为傲慢，甚至是粗鲁。威吓、排挤和颐指气使，埃德娜都留意到了，她拼命抓住她的篮子，寻找化妆间。","Though they had come early, she found everything in uproar.The main performance was under way, the orchestra was playing and the audience intermittently applauding.The infusion of the amateurs clogged the working of things behind the stage, crowded the passages, dressing rooms, and wings, and forced everybody into everybody else’s way.This was particularly distasteful to the professionals, who carried themselves as befitted those of a higher caste, and whose behavior toward the pariah amateurs was marked by hauteur and even brutality.And Edna, bullied and elbowed and shoved about, clinging desperately to her basket and seeking a dressing room, took note of it all."
"终于她找到了一间化妆间，和另外三个业余“女士”挤在一起，她们吵闹着“化妆”，还为一面单人镜争吵起来，嗓音很尖。　她的妆太简单了，一会儿就化完了。她们对她评头论足时，她离开了这三个处于休战的女人。莱蒂和她并肩一起。凭着耐心和毅力，她们设法在舞台的侧面找到一隐蔽处，在那里可以看到舞台。","A dressing room she finally found, jammed with three other amateur “ladies,” who were “making up” with much noise, high-pitched voices, and squabbling over a lone mirror.Her own make-up was so simple that it was quickly accomplished, and she left the trio of ladies holding an armed truce while they passed judgment upon her.Letty was close at her shoulder, and with patience and persistence they managed to get a nook in one of the wings which commanded a view of the stage."
"一个身材矮小、肤色黝黑的男人，衣冠楚楚、温文尔雅，穿着燕尾服，带着大高帽，正以高雅美妙而又装模作样的舞步在舞台上跳着华尔兹。他用细小的嗓音唱着什么，或者是关于某人，或者是一些特别悲哀的事情。当他歌声渐弱，快要到乐章末尾的时候，一个体形庞大、头上冠着一大堆金色头发的女人粗鲁地挤了埃德娜一下，狠狠地踩了她的脚趾，轻蔑地把她推到一边。“该死的业余爱好者！”她边走边嘘声责骂，下一时刻她站在了舞台上，优雅地向观众鞠躬，而那个又小又黑的男人则踮着他的脚尖在快速地旋转着。","A small, dark man, dapper and debonair, swallow-tailed and top-hatted, was waltzing about the stage with dainty, mincing steps, and in a thin little voice singing something or other about somebody or something evidently pathetic.As his waning voice neared the end of the lines, a large woman, crowned with an amazing wealth of blond hair, thrust rudely past Edna, trod heavily on her toes, and shoved her contemptuously to the side.“Bloomin’ hamateur!” she hissed as she went past, and the next instant she was on the stage, graciously bowing to the audience, while the small, dark man twirled extravagantly about on his tiptoes."
"“你们好，姑娘们！”","“Hello, girls!”"
"这个问候，每个音节都带着无与伦比的关心，在她耳边响起，这让她吃了一惊，差点跳了起来。一个态度和蔼、圆脸的年轻男人正和善地对她微笑着。他的“妆容”显然就是舞台上的流浪者的妆容，虽然没有不可或缺的胡须。","This greeting, drawled with an inimitable vocal caress in every syllable, close in her ear, caused Edna to give a startled little jump.A smooth-faced, moon-faced young man was smiling at her good-naturedly.His “make-up” was plainly that of the stock tramp of the stage, though the inevitable whiskers were lacking."
"“哦，一下子就可以把它们拍上去，”他解释着说，发现了她眼中的疑惑，手里挥着讨论着的装饰。“它们容易让人出汗。”他进一步解释。然后说，“你的表演是什么？”","“Oh, it don’t take a minute to slap’m on,” he explained, divining the search in her eyes and waving in his hand the adornment in question.“They make a feller sweat,” he explained further.And then, “What’s yer turn?”"
"“女高音——感伤的。”她回答说，试图表现得很随意，很自在。","“Soprano—sentimental,” she answered, trying to be offhand and at ease."
"“为什么你来干这个？”他直接问道。","“Whata you doin’ it for?” he demanded directly."
"“为了乐子；还能为什么？”她反驳道。","“For fun; what else?” she countered."
"“我一看到你，我就判断出来了。你在一家报社工作，是吗？”","“I just sized you up for that as soon as I put eyes on you.You ain’t graftin’ for a paper, are you?”"
"“我一生中只见过一个编辑，”她闪烁其词地说，“我，他——呃，我们相处得不是很好。”","“I never met but one editor in my life,” she replied evasively, “and I, he—well, we didn’t get on very well together.”"
"“为了找个工作？”","“Hittin’ ’m for a job?”"
"埃德娜漫不经心地点头，虽然内心焦虑，绞尽脑汁想换个话题。","Edna nodded carelessly, though inwardly anxious and cudgelling her brains for something to turn the conversation."
"“他说了什么？”","“What’d he say?”"
"“他说这个星期已经有18个女孩去过那儿了。”","“That eighteen other girls had already been there that week.”"
"“给你这个冰袋，呃？”圆脸的年轻男人笑着，拍着他的腿。“你知道，我们都是多疑的人。星期日报纸想要把业余爱好者之夜在一个小小的、漂亮的节目里彻底搞好，但经理并不这么看。一想到它就瞪眼。”","“Gave you the icy mit, eh?”The moon-faced young man laughed and slapped his thighs.“You see, we’re kind of suspicious.The Sunday papers ‘d like to get Amateur Night done up brown in a nice little package, and the manager don’t see it that way.Gets wild-eyed at the thought of it.”"
"“那么你表演什么呢？”她问。","“And what’s your turn?” she asked."
"“谁？我？哦，今晚我得扮演流浪汉。我叫查利·韦尔什，你知道。”","“Who? me?Oh, I’m doin’ the tramp act tonight.I’m Charley Welsh, you know.”"
"她感觉到，他提他的名字是想传达给她兴奋之情，但是她能做的最好的事就是礼貌地说：“哦，是吗？”","She felt that by the mention of his name he intended to convey to her complete enlightenment, but the best she could do was to say politely, “Oh, is that so?”"
"她想嘲笑他脸上浮出的受伤后的失望，但是她把自己的消遣隐藏了起来。","She wanted to laugh at the hurt disappointment which came into his face, but concealed her amusement."
"“过来，现在，”他直率地说，“你不能站在那儿，跟我说，你从来没有听说过查利·韦尔什？好吧，你肯定年轻。呃，我是独一无二的，独一无二的业余爱好者。必然，你肯定见过我。我哪儿都去。我可以成为一名专业人员的，但是我当业余爱好者赚的更多。”","“Come, now,” he said brusquely, “you can’t stand there and tell me you’ve never heard of Charley Welsh?Well, you must be young.Why, I’m an Only, the Only amateur at that.Sure, you must have seen me.I’m everywhere.I could be a professional, but I get more dough out of it by doin’ the amateur.”"
"“但是什么叫‘独一无二’呢？”她询问道，“我想知道。”","“But what’s an ‘Only’?” she queried.“I want to learn.”"
"“当然，”查利·韦尔什殷勤地说，“我来告诉你。‘独一无二’是无可匹敌的人，一个比其他人做得更好的人。他就是独一无二的，明白吗？”","“Sure,” Charley Welsh said gallantly.“I’ll put you wise.An ‘Only’ is a nonpareil, the feller that does one kind of a turn better’n any other feller.He’s the Only, see?”"
"埃德娜明白了。","And Edna saw."
"“在这行上要获得消息，”他继续说，“找我好了。我是独一无二的全能业余爱好者。今晚我要进行流浪汉的表演。虚张声势比真正去做更困难，但这就是表演，是业余爱好，是艺术。明白吗？我什么都做，从犹太人独白到团队合唱，舞蹈还有荷兰喜剧。当然，我是查利·韦尔什，独一无二的查利·韦尔什。”","“To get a line on the biz,” he continued, “throw yer lamps on me.I’m the Only all-round amateur.To-night I make a bluff at the tramp act.It’s harder to bluff it than to really do it, but then it’s acting, it’s amateur, it’s art.See?I do everything, from Sheeny monologue to team song and dance and Dutch comedian.Sure, I’m Charley Welsh, the Only Charley Welsh.”"
"那个又瘦又黑的男人和那个体形庞大的金发女人在舞台上用柔和的颤音优美地唱着，其他的专业演员会在他们之后演出。在此期间，查利·韦尔什跟埃德娜说了很多，告诉她很多杂乱而又冗长的信息。她也为《周日情报员》贮存了很多信息。","And in this fashion, while the thin, dark man and the large, blond woman warbled dulcetly out on the stage and the other professionals followed in their turns, did Charley Welsh put Edna wise, giving her much miscellaneous and superfluous information and much that she stored away for the Sunday Intelligencer."
"“好啦，”他突然说，“他在催你。你是第一次表演。当你表演的时候，不要介意骚动声。就像淑女一样完成你的演出。”","“Well, tra la loo,” he said suddenly.“There’s his highness chasin’ you up.Yer first on the bill.Never mind the row when you go on.Just finish yer turn like a lady.”"
"就是在这个时候，埃德娜觉得她当记者的雄心在远离她，她意识到她极其想去别处。但是舞台经理，像吃人妖魔一般，阻止了她的退却。她能听到乐队演奏起了她歌曲的开场，也能听到剧场的噪声渐渐渐弱，只剩下期待的沉默。","It was at that moment that Edna felt her journalistic ambition departing from her, and was aware of an overmastering desire to be somewhere else.But the stage manager, like an ogre, barred her retreat.She could hear the opening bars of her song going up from the orchestra and the noises of the house dying away to the silence of anticipation."
"“上去吧，”莱蒂低声说，捏了捏她的手；从另一端传来了查利·韦尔什那专横的命令——“不要放弃！”","“Go ahead,” Letty whispered, pressing her hand; and from the other side came the peremptory “Don’t flunk!” of Charley Welsh."
"但是她的双脚仿佛在地上扎了根，她虚弱地靠在一个移动布景上。管弦乐队又开始了，从剧场传来的长长的声音，清楚得令人惊奇：","But her feet seemed rooted to the floor, and she leaned weakly against a shift scene.The orchestra was beginning over again, and a lone voice from the house piped with startling distinctness:"
"“令人困惑的局面！去找南妮！”","“Puzzle picture!Find Nannie!”"
"一阵笑声迸发出来，埃德娜退缩了。但是经理强壮的双手从她的肩上滑落，迅速地、强有力地把她猛推到了舞台上。他的手和胳膊一览无遗，观众注意到这一局面，对这一发现报以雷鸣掌声。可怕的嘈杂声盖过了管弦乐队，埃德娜看见琴弓不断地划过小提琴，显然没发出声来。对她来说及时开始是不可能的。她双手叉着腰，耳朵努力地听着音乐，耐心等待着。剧场又一次嘈杂起来（后来她了解到观众一个最爱的把戏，就是迷惑业余爱好者，阻止他或她去听乐队）。","A roar of laughter greeted the sally, and Edna shrank back.But the strong hand of the manager descended on her shoulder, and with a quick, powerful shove propelled her out on to the stage.His hand and arm had flashed into full view, and the audience, grasping the situation, thundered its appreciation.The orchestra was drowned out by the terrible din, and Edna could see the bows scraping away across the violins, apparently without sound.It was impossible for her to begin in time, and as she patiently waited, arms akimbo and ears straining for the music, the house let loose again (a favorite trick, she afterward learned, of confusing the amateur by preventing him or her from hearing the orchestra)."
"但是埃德娜开始恢复清醒。她感觉到从楼下正厅到圆屋顶都弥漫着笑声，到处都是笑得扭曲的脸，还有哄堂大笑声，一阵高过一阵，此时她的苏格兰血统让她变得冷漠而愤怒了。努力演奏却无声的乐队对她示意了一下。她轻启双唇，把手臂前伸，摇摆身体，就好像她真的在唱歌一样。剧场的噪音更响了，试着淹没她的声音，但她平静地继续着她的哑剧。这似乎持续了很长时间，当观众厌倦了恶作剧，想听一听的时候，喧闹突然停止了，他们发现了她之前在表演的哑剧。有一会儿，除了乐队的演奏，一切都静了下来，她的嘴唇动着却没发出声音，然后观众意识到他们被欺骗了，再次爆发，这一次观众承认了她的胜利，真诚地鼓着掌。她选择在这个欢乐的时刻退出，鞠了个躬，朝后退，她离开舞台，投入莱蒂的怀抱里。","But Edna was recovering her presence of mind.She became aware, pit to dome, of a vast sea of smiling and fun-distorted faces, of vast roars of laughter, rising wave on wave, and then her Scotch blood went cold and angry.The hard-working but silent orchestra gave her the cue, and, without making a sound, she began to move her lips, stretch forth her arms, and sway her body, as though she were really singing.The noise in the house redoubled in the attempt to drown her voice, but she serenely went on with her pantomime.This seemed to continue an interminable time, when the audience, tiring of its prank and in order to hear, suddenly stilled its clamor, and discovered the dumb show she had been making.For a moment all was silent, save for the orchestra, her lips moving on without a sound, and then the audience realized that it had been sold, and broke out afresh, this time with genuine applause in acknowledgment of her victory.She chose this as the happy moment for her exit, and with a bow and a backward retreat, she was off the stage in Letty’s arms."
"最坏的时刻已经过去了，那个晚上剩下的时间，她在业余爱好者之间来回走动，交谈、倾听、观察、发现它的真正意义，在心里把它全都记录了下来。查利·韦尔什把自己变成了她的导师和守护天使。他把这个自己分配的工作做得太好了，以致于当一切结束的时候，她觉得她准备得已经足够充分，可以写文章了。但是提议是要做两场表演，她本性中的勇气迫使她去实践诺言。同时，在中间的这几天里，她发现一些霎那间得到的印象需要去证实；所以，在星期六，她又来了，带着折叠筐和莱蒂。","The worst was past, and for the rest of the evening she moved about among the amateurs and professionals, talking, listening, observing, finding out what it meant and taking mental notes of it all.Charley Welsh constituted himself her preceptor and guardian angel, and so well did he perform the self-allotted task that when it was all over she felt fully prepared to write her article.But the proposition had been to do two turns, and her native pluck forced her to live up to it.Also, in the course of the intervening days, she discovered fleeting impressions that required verification; so, on Saturday, she was back again, with her telescope basket and Letty."
"经理好像一直在找她，当经理一见到她时，她发现他的眼里有一丝慰藉。他赶紧去问候她，和之前妖魔化的行为不同的是，他以一种滑稽可笑的方式向她鞠躬以示尊敬。当他鞠躬的时候，她略过他的肩头，看见了查利·韦尔什在故意眨眼。","The manager seemed looking for her, and she caught an expression of relief in his eyes when he first saw her.He hurried up, greeted her, and bowed with a respect ludicrously at variance with his previous ogre-like behavior.And as he bowed, across his shoulders she saw Charley Welsh deliberately wink."
"但是惊喜才刚刚开始。经理乞求她把姐姐引荐给他，接着和她们俩很愉快地交谈，非常努力热切地让一切变得很愉悦。甚至他过火到把一间化妆间给埃德娜一人使用，使之前认识的三个业余爱好女士嫉妒起来，这简直无法用言语形容。埃德娜不知所措，直到她在走道里碰到查利·韦尔什，谜团才解开。","But the surprise had just begun.The manager begged to be introduced to her sister, chatted entertainingly with the pair of them, and strove greatly and anxiously to be agreeable.He even went so far as to give Edna a dressing room to herself, to the unspeakable envy of the three other amateur ladies of previous acquaintance.Edna was nonplussed, and it was not till she met Charley Welsh in the passage that light was thrown on the mystery."
"“你好！”他问候她，“生活优裕吧？每件事都照你想的那样。”","“Hello!” he greeted her.“On Easy Street, eh?Everything slidin’ your way.”"
"她欢快地笑了笑。","She smiled brightly."
"“当然，我觉得你是个女记者。当我看到他尽力讨好你的时候，我差点儿大笑出来。现在诚实点儿，那不是你的计谋，对吗？”","“Thinks yer a female reporter, sure.I almost split when I saw’m layin’ himself out sweet an’ pleasin’.Honest, now, that ain’t yer graft, is it?”"
"“以前我告诉过你关于我和编辑的事，”她含糊其词地说，“我现在说的话很诚实，以前的话也很诚实。”","“I told you my experience with editors,” she parried.“And honest now, it was honest, too.”"
"但是独一无二的查利·韦尔什怀疑地摇了摇头。“这个我一点儿也不关心”，他声称，“要是你诚实的话，给我说几条要注意的事情，正确的那种，好的广告，你知道的。如果你不诚实的话，无论如何你都是对的。说直接一点儿，你和我们不是一类人。”","But the Only Charley Welsh shook his head dubiously.“Not that I care a rap,” he declared.“And if you are, just gimme a couple of lines of notice, the right kind, good ad, you know.And if yer not, why yer all right anyway.Yer not our class, that’s straight.”"
"这次她以老手的勇气进行表演，她下场后，经理又开始掌控局面；在说了一些好话，像往常一样友善后，他回到了重点上。","After her turn, which she did this time with the nerve of an old campaigner, the manager returned to the charge; and after saying nice things and being generally nice himself, he came to the point."
"“我希望你能好好对待我们，”他讨好地说，“靠我们做一些正确的事，诸如此类的事情？”“噢，”她天真地回答说，“你不能说服我再表演一场,我知道我似乎是要再表演的，你想继续要我表演，但是，我真的，真的不能。”","“You’ll treat us well, I hope,” he said insinuatingly.“Do the right thing by us, and all that?”“Oh,” she answered innocently, “you couldn’t persuade me to do another turn; I know I seemed to take and that you’d like to have me, but I really, really can’t.”"
"“你知道我的意思。”他带着以前那种威胁的语气说。","“You know what I mean,” he said, with a touch of his old bulldozing manner."
"“不，我真的不想，” 她坚持说，“无论如何，歌舞杂耍表演实在太——太令我伤脑筋了。”","“No, I really won’t,” she persisted.“Vaudeville’s too—too wearing on the nerves, my nerves, at any rate.”"
"随即他看上去有点儿困惑和怀疑，避免把这个话题深入下去。","Whereat he looked puzzled and doubtful, and forbore to press the point further."
"但是周一早上，当她去他办公室领两场演出费时，他倒令她迷惑不解了。","But on Monday morning, when she came to his office to get her pay for the two turns, it was he who puzzled her."
"“你肯定误解我了，”他油嘴滑舌地撒谎道，“我记得说过付给你车马费这类事情。我们一直这样做，你知道的，但是我们从来不付钱给业余爱好者。这会使整件事情变得不光彩。不是这样的，查利·韦尔什在戏弄你。他演出没有任何报酬。没有业余爱好者会得到报酬。这个想法太荒谬了。不过，这里有50美分。这也付了你姐姐的车马费。还有，”——非常假惺惺地，——“为了卢布斯，请允许我谢谢你的服务和由此带来的成功贡献。”","“You surely must have mistaken me,” he lied glibly.“I remember saying something about paying your car fare.We always do this, you know, but we never, never pay amateurs.That would take the life and sparkle out of the whole thing.No, Charley Welsh was stringing you.He gets paid nothing for his turns.No amateur gets paid.The idea is ridiculous.However, here’s fifty cents.It will pay your sister’s car fare also.And,”—very suavely,—“speaking for the Loops, permit me to thank you for the kind and successful contribution of your services.”"
"那天下午，忠于自己对马克斯·欧文的诺言，她把打印出来的版本交到了他的手上。快速翻看时，他不断地点点头，发出一连串的赞扬评论：“好！——就是这样！——就是这样的东西！——心理描写太好了！——就是这种想法！——你抓住了！——太好了！——这儿少了一点，但是这样也行——那很有力！——太强了！——生动！——图片！图片！——太棒了！——这是最棒的！”","That afternoon, true to her promise to Max Irwin, she placed her typewritten copy into his hands.And while he ran over it, he nodded his head from time to time, and maintained a running fire of commendatory remarks: “Good!—that’s it!—that’s the stuff!—psychology’s all right!—the very idea!—you’ve caught it!—excellent!—missed it a bit here, but it’ll go—that’s vigorous!—strong!—vivid!—pictures! pictures!—excellent!—most excellent!”"
"当他浏览到最后一页的底部时，他伸出手说：“亲爱的怀曼小姐，祝贺你。我必须说你超出了我的期望，毫不夸张地说，超出了很多。现在你是记者了，天生的记者。你抓到了重点，你确实抓到了它。毫无疑问，《情报员》将把它登出来，也会雇用你。他们必须雇用你。如果他们没有雇用你，一些其他的报纸也会雇用你。”“不过，这是什么？”接着，他询问道，脸变得严肃起来，“你对得到的演出费什么也没说，这可是这篇专题报道的重点之一。要是你记得的话，我很清楚地提到过这一点。”","And when he had run down to the bottom of the last page, holding out his hand: “My dear Miss Wyman, I congratulate you.I must say you have exceeded my expectations, which, to say the least, were large.You are a journalist, a natural journalist.You’ve got the grip, and you’re sure to get on.The Intelligencer will take it, without doubt, and take you too.They’ll have to take you.If they don’t, some of the other papers will get you.”“But what’s this?” he queried, the next instant, his face going serious.“You’ve said nothing about receiving the pay for your turns, and that’s one of the points of the feature.I expressly mentioned it, if you’ll remember.”"
"“这不行，”当她解释的时候，他说着，不悦地摇了摇头，“你总能拿到一些钱。让我想想。让我想一下。”","“It will never do,” he said, shaking his head ominously, when she had explained.“You simply must collect that money somehow.Let me see.Let me think a moment.”"
"“没关系，欧文先生，”她说，“我已给你添了不少麻烦了。请让我借用一下你的电话，我要再打给厄恩斯特·赛姆斯。”","“Never mind, Mr. Irwin,” she said.“I’ve bothered you enough.Let me use your’phone, please, and I’ll try Mr. Ernst Symes again.”"
"他让出了他桌子边的椅子，埃德娜拿起了听筒。","He vacated his chair by the desk, and Edna took down the receiver."
"“查利·韦尔什生病了，”电话接通之后她说，“什么？不，我不是查利·韦尔什。查利·韦尔什生病了，他妹妹想知道她今天下午是不是能替他去领工资？”","“Charley Welsh is sick,” she began, when the connection had been made.“What?No I’m not Charley Welsh.Charley Welsh is sick, and his sister wants to know if she can come out this afternoon and draw his pay for him?”"
"“告诉查利·韦尔什的妹妹，他今天早上出场了，领走了他的工资。”这是经理一贯的腔调，既干脆又严厉。","“Tell Charley Welsh’s sister that Charley Welsh was out this morning, and drew his own pay,” came back the manager’s familiar tones, crisp with asperity."
"“好的，”埃德娜继续说，“现在南·伯莱妮想知道，她和她的姐姐今天下午能过去领她的工资吗？”","“All right,” Edna went on.“And now Nan Bellayne wants to know if she and her sister can come out this afternoon and draw Nan Bellayne’s pay?”"
"“他说什么了？他说什么了？”当她挂断电话，马克斯·欧文兴奋地喊道。“南·伯莱妮对他意义重大，她和她的姐姐能过去，拿回她的工资，并且还有脱离卢布斯的自由。”","“What’d he say?What’d he say?”Max Irwin cried excitedly, as she hung up.“That Nan Bellayne was too much for him, and that she and her sister could come out and get her pay and the freedom of the Loops, to boot.”"
"“另外还有一件事，”他如同上次她拜访时那样，在门口打断了她的感谢。“既然你已经表现出你的才能，我认为，呃，我亲自邀请你加入《情报员》，这是一种殊荣。”","“One thing, more,” he interrupted her thanks at the door, as on her previous visit.“Now that you’ve shown the stuff you’re made of, I should esteem it, ahem, a privilege to give you a line myself to the Intelligencer people.”"
