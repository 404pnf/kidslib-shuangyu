"中国人约翰在纽约","John Chinaman in New York "
"作者：马克·吐温","by Mark Twain"
"纽约有许多很大的茶叶店，当我路过一家茶叶店时，发现一个中国人坐在店前，充当招牌。每一个路过的人都直盯着他看，只要他们的脑袋在转过肩膀时不会脱臼，他们就会一直看；还有一群人则干脆停下来，专门盯着他看。","As I passed along by one of those monster American tea stores in New York, I found a Chinaman sitting before it acting in the capacity of a sign.Everybody that passed by gave him a steady stare as long as their heads would twist over their shoulders without dislocating their necks, and a group had stopped to stare deliberately."
"我们大谈特谈文明和人性，但对于一个和我们一样的人，我们却心安理得地让他干这样的活，贬低他、羞辱他，难道我们就不觉得羞愧吗？看到这种事，我们发现自己将其看成好玩的事情，觉得好奇，而不是感到难受，进行深刻反思，此时，我们难道不该反省一下吗？这是个可怜的家伙，因为时运不济，他漂洋过海，背井离乡。他的身边围着一些无所事事的陌生人，他的遭遇本该打动这些人，但是打动他们了吗？显然没有。这些人自称他们的民族是优等民族、文明民族和血统高贵的民族。他们仔细打量着他那顶古怪的中式帽子，帽顶似山峰，上头缀着小圆球，他长长的辫子垂在背后；他穿着丝质短衬衫，上面的图案和盘花纽扣十分奇特（和他其他的衣服一样，衬衫又旧又烂，穿起来很难看）；下身穿着蓝色棉布裤，裤腿很紧，脚踝处紧紧地扎了起来；他的钝头鞋是厚软木鞋底，十分笨重。他们从头到脚打量了他之后，开起了不雅的玩笑，讥笑他那奇特的服装，或是他那忧郁的神情，然后才继续前进。这个蒙古人无依无靠，我内心对他充满了同情。（此处可能是作者误把中国和蒙古当成了一个地方。——译者注）我想知道，他那忧伤神情背后隐藏着什么？他那茫然的眼神向往的远方景色是什么样的？他那远在万里之外的思想和心，是否越过了汹涌空寂的太平洋？是否留在了中国的稻田和羽毛般的棕榈树丛里？是留在了记忆中的山顶的树阴下，还是留在了我们这样的地方没有的、开满花的灌木丛和奇特的森林树木中？当他时不时沉浸在想象和梦想中时，他是否能听到熟悉的笑声和几近忘却的声音，他是否偶尔能瞥见逝去的岁月中那亲切的脸庞？我说道，残酷的命运降临到这个黄褐色皮肤的流浪汉身上。对这些闲人来说，他那身穷光蛋的打扮和枯燥的逃亡经历已经没有了吸引力，为了让他们至少被这个可怜家伙的话所打动，我拍了拍他的肩膀，说道：","Is it not a shame that we, who prate so much about civilization and humanity, are content to degrade a fellow-being to such an office as this?Is it not time for reflection when we find ourselves willing to see in such a being matter for frivolous curiosity instead of regret and grave reflection?Here was a poor creature whom hard fortune had exiled from his natural home beyond the seas, and whose troubles ought to have touched these idle strangers that thronged about him; but did it?Apparently not.Men calling themselves the superior race, the race of culture and of gentle blood, scanned his quaint Chinese hat, with peaked roof and ball on top, and his long queue dangling down his back; his short silken blouse, curiously frogged and figured (and, like the rest of his raiment, rusty, dilapidated, and awkwardly put on); his blue cotton, tight-legged pants, tied close around the ankles; and his clumsy blunt-toed shoes with thick cork soles; and having so scanned him from head to foot, cracked some unseemly joke about his outlandish attire or his melancholy face, and passed on.In my heart I pitied the friendless Mongol.I wondered what was passing behind his sad face, and what distant scene his vacant eye was dreaming of.Were his thoughts with his heart, ten thousand miles away, beyond the billowy wastes of the Pacific? among the ricefields and the plumy palms of China? under the shadows of remembered mountain peaks, or in groves of bloomy shrubs and strange forest trees unknown to climes like ours?And now and then, rippling among his visions and his dreams, did he hear familiar laughter and half-forgotten voices, and did he catch fitful glimpses of the friendly faces of a bygone time?A cruel fate it is, I said, that is befallen this bronzed wanderer.In order that the group of idlers might be touched at least by the words of the poor fellow, since the appeal of his pauper dress and his dreary exile was lost upon them, I touched him on the shoulder and said:"
"“振作起来——不要消沉下去。美国并没有这样对你，只是一个公民这样对你，他内心的人性已经被贪婪之欲吞噬了。美国有更为博大的胸怀去接纳遭到驱逐和遭受压迫的人。美国和美国人民总是随时准备帮助那些不幸的人。钱会筹到的——你会回到中国的，你也会再次见到你的朋友的。他们这儿付给你多少薪水？”","“Cheer up—don’t be downhearted.It is not America that treats you in this way, it is merely one citizen, whose greed of gain has eaten the humanity out of his heart.America has a broader hospitality for the exiled and oppressed.America and Americans are always ready to help the unfortunate.Money shall be raised—you shall go back to China you shall see your friends again.What wages do they pay you here?”"
"“一星期四美元，一分也不多，衣食自理；不过也不怎么累，就是这身不合适的镶边衣服太贵了。”","“Divil a cint but four dollars a week and find meself; but it’s aisy, barrin’ the troublesome furrin clothes that’s so expinsive.”"
"这个背井离乡的人继续呆在工作岗位上。纽约茶商需要别具一格的招牌时，肯定能招到中国人。","The exile remains at his post.The New York tea merchants who need picturesque signs are not likely to run out of Chinamen."
