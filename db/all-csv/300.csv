"献词","DEDICATION"
"谨以此献给根特霍德的卡罗琳·加利赞(娘家姓瓦莱夫斯卡)王妃以表作者的敬意与怀念","To Madame la Princesse Caroline Galitzin de Genthod, nee Comtesse Walewska.Homage and remembrances of the author."
"几乎所有的年轻人都有一个自己乐于用以衡量前途的圆规。当他们的决心与圆规的张角宽度一致时，世界就是他们的了。但是，这种精神生活的现象仅仅发生在某一年龄段。对所有人来说，这个年龄段指的是22岁至28岁之间。这是个具有伟大思想和新鲜观念的年龄段，因为这是孕育无限欲望的年龄。人们过了这个短暂如播种期的年龄段，便进入了付诸实践的年龄。可以说，人有两个青春——信仰的青春和行动的青春。对于那些得天独厚的人，这两个青春常常融合在一起，比如伟人中的伟人——凯撒、牛顿和波拿巴。","Nearly all young men have a compass with which they delight in measuring the future.When their will is equal to the breadth of the angle at which they open it the world is theirs.But this phenomenon of the inner life takes place only at a certain age.That age, which for all men lies between twenty-two and twenty-eight, is the period of great thoughts, of fresh conceptions, because it is the age of immense desires.After that age, short as the seed-time, comes that of execution.There are, as it were, two youths,—the youth of belief, the youth of action; these are often commingled in men whom Nature has favored and who, like Caesar, like Newton, like Bonaparte, are the greatest among great men."
"我揣测着，形成一种思想需要多长时间。手执圆规，站在大海边的一块几百英寻高的岩石上——下面的海浪拍打着礁石——我测量着我的未来，像一位工程师或建筑师在一块空地上绘制城堡和宫殿那样用各种预想搭建着未来。","I was measuring how long a time it might take a thought to develop.Compass in hand, standing on a rock some hundred fathoms above the ocean, the waves of which were breaking on the reef below, I surveyed my future, filling it with books as an engineer or builder traces on vacant ground a palace or a fort."
"大海景色宜人。我刚刚沐浴完、穿好衣服，等候着波利娜。她也正在细沙垫底的花岗岩浴盆里沐浴，这是大自然赠给水精灵最精美的浴室。我们处在克鲁瓦奇半岛最远端，克鲁瓦奇在布列塔尼，是个雅致的小半岛。它离港口很远，交通不便，因此海岸警卫员认为几乎没有必要巡视这里。在海浪上漂浮之后在苍穹中游荡吧！——啊！谁不想像我这般在未来的海洋中穿梭！我为什么要乱想呢？邪恶是从哪里来的呢——谁会知道！思想从我们的心灵和脑海里迸发出来，是不会和我们商量的。对艺术家来说，没有哪一个名妓能比思想更善变、更傲慢。当思想闪现时，我们得像抓住命运一样，把它牢牢地握住。","The sea was beautiful; I had just dressed after bathing; and I awaited Pauline, who was also bathing, in a granite cove floored with fine sand, the most coquettish bath-room that Nature ever devised for her water-fairies.The spot was at the farther end of Croisic, a dainty little peninsula in Brittany; it was far from the port, and so inaccessible that the coast-guard seldom thought it necessary to pass that way.To float in ether after floating on the wave!—ah! who would not have floated on the future as I did!Why was I thinking?Whence comes evil?—who knows!Ideas drop into our hearts or into our heads without consulting us.No courtesan was ever more capricious nor more imperious than conception is to artists; we must grasp it, like fortune, by the hair when it comes."
"像阿斯托弗骑在他的双翼鹰头马上一样，我骑在我的思想上周游世界，按照自己的想象改变世界。疯狂的想象敦促着我，要我负责实现这些大胆的构想。现在，我正四下观望、竭力寻觅，想为这些构想找到好的征兆。这时，传来了一声悦耳的欢呼——这是一个出浴的女人发出的神清气爽的、充满快乐的呼唤。潮水来回涌动，在岸边形成了一道白线。而这声呼唤盖过了细浪前沿的低语。当我听到那个从心灵深处迸发出来的声音时，我好像看到一位天使双脚踏在岩石间，展开双翅，对我喊道：“你注定会成功的！”我容光焕发、轻松愉快地下了坡，就像一块从陡峭的斜坡上一蹦一跳地滚下来的卵石一样。看到我的时候，她说：","Astride upon my thought, like Astolphe on his hippogriff, I was galloping through worlds, suiting them to my fancy.Presently, as I looked about me to find some omen for the bold productions my wild imagination was urging me to undertake, a pretty cry, the cry of a woman issuing refreshed and joyous from a bath, rose above the murmur of the rippling fringes as their flux and reflux marked a white line along the shore.Hearing that note as it gushed from a soul, I fancied I saw among the rocks the foot of an angel, who with outspread wings cried out to me, “Thou shalt succeed!”I came down radiant, light-hearted; I bounded like a pebble rolling down a rapid slope.When she saw me, she said—"
"“你这是怎么了？”","“What is it?”"
"我没有回答，我的眼睛湿润了。昨天晚上，波利娜了解了我的悲痛，正如现在她了解我的快乐一样。她那不可思议的敏感，宛如竖琴会随气流的变化而律动一样。人生都有辉煌的时刻。我们一起沿着海滩静静地走着。天上没有一丝云彩，海面亦无一点波澜；在旁人眼中天空与海洋不过是两张蓝色的幕布，一张叠着另一张，但是我们——我们彼此心意相通，能在广阔无垠的海天之间，唤起滋养青春的梦幻——每次水波荡漾或者空气律动，我们就紧紧握着彼此的手，因为这些微小的波动正是我们相和的心意。谁没有在婚后爱情中体验那无限欢愉的时刻呢？那时，灵魂似乎摆脱了肉体的束缚，恢复了本来的面貌；在某种程度上来说，是回到了灵魂来自的那个世界。两人感情总会有相互交织、飘然飞升的时刻，这就像孩子们几乎不知为什么就手拉着手一起奔跑一样。我们就这样行进着。","I did not answer; my eyes were moist.The night before, Pauline had understood my sorrows, as she now understood my joy, with the magical sensitiveness of a harp that obeys the variations of the atmosphere.Human life has glorious moments.Together we walked in silence along the beach.The sky was cloudless, the sea without a ripple; others might have thought them merely two blue surfaces, the one above the other, but we—we who heard without the need of words, we who could evoke between these two infinitudes the illusions that nourish youth,—we pressed each other’s hands at every change in the sheet of water or the sheets of air, for we took those slight phenomena as the visible translation of our double thought.Who has never tasted in wedded love that moment of illimitable joy when the soul seems freed from the trammels of flesh, and finds itself restored, as it were, to the world whence it came?Are there not hours when feelings clasp each other and fly upward, like children taking hands and running, they scarce know why?It was thus we went along."
"此刻，当村庄的屋顶像一道暗淡的灰色晕线呈现在地平线上时，我们遇到了一个渔夫，这个贫穷的人正要回克鲁瓦奇。他赤着脚，亚麻布的裤子下端破破烂烂的，身上穿着平常的帆布衬衣和破烂的短上衣。这幅穷困潦倒的模样刺痛了我们，就像我们的和声中出现了杂音一样。我们看着彼此，都为自己当时没有挖掘阿布·卡塞姆的金库的能力而感到伤心。但是我们看见渔夫右手里晃来晃去的绳子上系着一只上乘的龙虾和一只螃蟹，渔夫的左手则提着他的渔具和渔网。","At the moment when the village roofs began to show like a faint gray line on the horizon, we met a fisherman, a poor man returning to Croisic.His feet were bare; his linen trousers ragged round the bottom; his shirt of common sailcloth, and his jacket tatters.This abject poverty pained us; it was like a discord amid our harmonies.We looked at each other, grieving mutually that we had not at that moment the power to dip into the treasury of Aboul Casem.But we saw a splendid lobster and a crab fastened to a string which the fisherman was dangling in his right hand, while with the left he held his tackle and his net."
"我们想买他的战利品，就上前和他搭话——我们相视而笑，表明我们都有此意；作为回应，我轻轻地按了一下挽着的那只胳膊，把它拉向我心窝这边。这个动作虽然属于微不足道的那一种，但是当我们围坐在火炉旁，回想起这个微小的动作和被这个动作感动的时间和地点的时候，这个微小的动作却带来了如诗般的回忆。虽然这个动作的效果有如蜃景，也从没被记载下来过，但是当我们生活愉快、心灵充实时，它就浮现在我们周遭的事物中。最宜人的景色是我们亲手缔造的。若是一个人的记忆里有一块岩石，而它占据的位置比那些要花费很大力气才能一睹的异域名胜还要大的话，那么只要这个人有一点诗意，就不会忘掉这块岩石。岩石周围思潮澎湃。那里，整个生命逐步进化；那里，所有恐惧纷纷散去；那里，希望之光投射到灵魂里。此刻，太阳与这些充满着爱意和对未来之憧憬的思想产生了共鸣，它将一缕温暖的光线投到那块蛮荒的岩石的侧面；几朵野山花清晰可见；平和而寂静的氛围让这块崎岖的巉岩显得更加伟大——尽管梦想家赋予了它色彩，然而它实际上是阴暗的。岩石上长着稀疏的植物、暖色的春黄菊、叶子柔软的铁线蕨，让它显得非常美丽。啊，依依不舍的佳节；啊，富丽堂皇的装饰；啊，对人类力量的欢乐颂扬！布里昂的湖泊曾经对我这样诉说。克鲁瓦奇的岩石也许会是我最后的欢愉。如果这样的话，波利娜会怎么想呢？","We accosted him with the intention of buying his haul,—an idea which came to us both, and was expressed in a smile, to which I responded by a slight pressure of the arm I held and drew toward my heart.It was one of those nothings of which memory makes poems when we sit by the fire and recall the hour when that nothing moved us, and the place where it did so,—a mirage the effects of which have never been noted down, though it appears on the objects that surround us in moments when life sits lightly and our hearts are full.The loveliest scenery is that we make ourselves.What man with any poesy in him does not remember some mere mass of rock, which holds, it may be, a greater place in his memory than the celebrated landscapes of other lands, sought at great cost.Beside that rock, tumultuous thoughts!There a whole life evolved; there all fears dispersed; there the rays of hope descended to the soul!At this moment, the sun, sympathizing with these thoughts of love and of the future, had cast an ardent glow upon the savage flanks of the rock; a few wild mountain flowers were visible; the stillness and the silence magnified that rugged pile,—really somber, though tinted by the dreamer, and beautiful beneath its scanty vegetation, the warm chamomile, the Venus’ tresses with their velvet leaves.Oh, lingering festival; oh, glorious decorations; oh, happy exaltation of human forces!Once already the lake of Brienne had spoken to me thus.The rock of Croisic may be perhaps the last of these my joys.If so, what will become of Pauline?"
"“您今天是不是捕获了好多东西，老兄？”我对渔夫说。","“Have you had a good catch to-day, my man?” I said to the fisherman."
"“是的，先生。”他回答道，一边停了下来，把脸转向我们。他脸色黑黝黝的，那是整日受到水面阳光反射的人才有的脸色。","“Yes, monsieur,” he replied, stopping and turning toward us the swarthy face of those who spend whole days exposed to the reflection of the sun upon the water."
"那张面孔象征着渔夫长久顺从、忍耐，生活很宁静。这人的声音很柔和、话语很亲切，显然一点也不自负；他还有点虚弱和瘦小。如果那时面对的是另外一张面孔，我们也许会感到不快。","That face was an emblem of long resignation, of the patience of a fisherman and his quiet ways.The man had a voice without harshness, kind lips, evidently no ambition, and something frail and puny about him.Any other sort of countenance would, at that moment, have jarred upon us."
"“您要去哪儿卖您的鱼？”","“Where shall you sell your fish?”"
"“去镇上。”","“In the town.”"
"“这只龙虾的售价会是多少？”","“How much will they pay you for that lobster?”"
"“十五苏。”","“Fifteen sous.”"
"“那么这只螃蟹呢？”","“And the crab?”"
"“二十苏。”","“Twenty sous.”"
"“为什么龙虾和螃蟹的差价这么大？”","“Why so much difference between a lobster and a crab?”"
"“先生，螃蟹吃起来更美味。另外，螃蟹很难捉，它像猴子一样灵敏。”","“Monsieur, the crab is much more delicate eating.Besides, it’s as malicious as a monkey, and it seldom lets you catch it.”"
"“我们出一百苏，您愿意把这两个卖给我们吗？”波利娜问道。","“Will you let us buy the two for a hundred sous?” asked Pauline."
"那人好像惊呆了。","The man seemed petrified."
"“你休想买到！”我笑着对波利娜说，“我出十法郎。我们应该把感情也计算在内。”","“You shall not have it!” I said to her, laughing.“I’ll pay ten francs; we should count the emotions in.”"
"“很好。”她说，“那么我出十法郎零二苏。”","“Very well,” she said, “then I’ll pay ten francs, two sous.”"
"“十法郎十苏。”","“Ten francs, ten sous.”"
"“十二法郎。”","“Twelve francs.”"
"“十五法郎。”","“Fifteen francs.”"
"“十五法郎零五十生丁。”波利娜说。","“Fifteen francs, fifty centimes,” she said."
"“一百法郎。”","“One hundred francs.”"
"“一百五十法郎。”","“One hundred and fifty francs.”"
"我屈服了。那时，我们还不够富，出不起更高的价钱。面对这样的恶作剧，我们这位可怜的渔夫不知道是该生气好，还是狂喜好。直到我们把女房东的姓名告诉他，让他把龙虾和螃蟹送到她家去，这才把他从困惑中解救出来。","I yielded.We were not rich enough at that moment to bid higher.Our poor fisherman did not know whether to be angry at a hoax, or to go mad with joy; we drew him from his quandary by giving him the name of our landlady and telling him to take the lobster and the crab to her house."
"“您赚的钱够维持生计吗？”为了了解他穷困潦倒的原因，我问这个人。","“Do you earn enough to live on?” I asked the man, in order to discover the cause of his evident penury."
"“过得很艰难，而且总是很穷。”他答道，“一个人要是没有渔船和可在深海捕捞的渔网，只靠鱼竿和鱼线在海边捕捞的话，那就基本是靠天收了。您看，我们必须等着鱼或贝类自己送上门来，而真正的渔夫会出海捕捞它们。用这种方式谋生是很艰难的，我是这个地区唯一一个在海边捕鱼的人。我整日一无所获。要想抓住一只螃蟹，必须得趁它睡着了才行，就像这只一样；也只能抓到那些傻得躲到岩石里的龙虾。有时，涨潮会把蚌类冲过来，我会抓住它们。”","“With great hardships, and always poorly,” he replied.“Fishing on the coast, when one hasn’t a boat or deep-sea nets, nothing but pole and line, is a very uncertain business.You see we have to wait for the fish, or the shell-fish; whereas a real fisherman puts out to sea for them.It is so hard to earn a living this way that I’m the only man in these parts who fishes along-shore.I spend whole days without getting anything.To catch a crab, it must go to sleep, as this one did, and a lobster must be silly enough to stay among the rocks.Sometimes after a high tide the mussels come in and I grab them.”"
"“那么，平均一下，您每天的收入是多少？”","“Well, taking one day with another, how much do you earn?”"
"“噢，十一或十二苏。如果就我一个人，我可以靠这些钱度日，但是我还有老父亲，他什么也干不了，因为他瞎了，但他是一个好人。”","“Oh, eleven or twelve sous.I could do with that if I were alone; but I have got my old father to keep, and he can’t do anything, the good man, because he’s blind.”"
"听到这些简短的话语，波利娜和我相视无言，然后我问：","At these words, said simply, Pauline and I looked at each other without a word; then I asked,—"
"“您没有妻子或者好朋友吗？”","“Haven’t you a wife, or some good friend?”"
"他瞥了我们一眼，这是我见过的最令人痛惜的一瞥，回答说：","He cast upon us one of the most lamentable glances that I ever saw as he answered,—"
"“如果我要娶妻子，就必须抛弃我的父亲。我不能既养活父亲又养活妻儿。”","“If I had a wife I must abandon my father; I could not feed him and a wife and children too.”"
"“唉，可怜的小伙子，您为什么不去盐场或者港口贩盐，好多赚些钱呢？”","“Well, my poor lad, why don’t you try to earn more at the salt marshes, or by carrying the salt to the harbor?”"
"“啊，先生，那种工作我干不了三个月。我的身体不够健壮，如果我死了，我的父亲就得要饭。我不得不从事这种行业，因为它不要多少技巧，只要有足够的耐心就行了。”","“Ah, monsieur, I couldn’t do that work three months.I am not strong enough, and if I died my father would have to beg.I am forced to take a business which only needs a little knack and a great deal of patience.”"
"“但是，一天十二苏，两个人怎么生活呢？”","“But how can two persons live on twelve sous a day?”"
"“唉，先生，我们吃荞麦饼和我从岩石上扒下来的藤壶。”","“Oh, monsieur, we eat cakes made of buckwheat, and barnacles which I get off the rocks.”"
"“您多大年纪了？”","“How old are you?”"
"“三十七岁。”","“Thirty-seven.”"
"“您离开过克鲁瓦奇吗？”","“Did you ever leave Croisic?”"
"“我曾经去过盖朗德，去参加征兵。还有，我去过萨沃奈，去找给入伍军人量身高的先生们。如果我再高半英寸，我就能当兵了。那样，我会在第一次行军时死掉，那我可怜的父亲今天就得乞讨了。”","“I went once to Guerande to draw for the conscription; and I went to Savenay to the messieurs who measure for the army.If I had been half an inch taller they’d have made me a soldier.I should have died of my first march, and my poor father would to-day be begging his bread.”"
"我想到了很多悲剧。波利娜在我身边，一定承受了太多痛苦，都习惯情绪的大起大落了。不过，我们谁也没听到过比这些话更触动人心的话了。我们沉默着继续向前走，各自测量着这种默默无闻的生命的深度，钦佩着这种忘我而高贵的奉献精神。我们诧异于弱小者的力量。这个人的下意识慷慨行为使我们显得很渺小。我看见那个生来就被锁在这块岩石上的可怜的人，就像一个苦役被锁在他的铁球上一样。为了谋生，他二十年来注视着贝类，一种专一的情感支撑着他，让他坚忍不拔。多少时间被浪费在这孤寂的海岸上！多少希望被这变化无常的天气打碎！他悬挂在花岗岩上，胳膊像印度行者一样展开。这时他的父亲正坐在安静、黑暗的茅屋里等待着最粗劣的面包，如果大海保佑的话还会有点贝类。","I had thought out many dramas; Pauline was accustomed to great emotions beside a man so suffering as myself; well, never had either of us listened to words so moving as these.We walked on in silence, measuring, each of us, the silent depths of that obscure life, admiring the nobility of a devotion which was ignorant of itself.The strength of that feebleness amazed us; the man’s unconscious generosity belittled us.I saw that poor being of instinct chained to that rock like a galley-slave to his ball; watching through twenty years for shell-fish to earn a living, and sustained in his patience by a single sentiment.How many hours wasted on a lonely shore!How many hopes defeated by a change of weather!He was hanging there to a granite rock, his arm extended like that of an Indian fakir, while his father, sitting in their hovel, awaited, in silence and darkness, a meal of the coarsest bread and shell-fish, if the sea permitted."
"“您喝过酒吗？”我问。","“Do you ever drink wine?” I asked."
"“一年三四次。”他回答道。","“Three or four times a year,” he replied."
"“那么，今天您俩应该喝点酒——您和您父亲，我们再给您一些白面包。”","“Well, you shall drink it to-day,—you and your father; and we will send you some white bread.”"
"“先生，您真是太好了。”","“You are very kind, monsieur.”"
"“如果您带我们沿着海滨到巴茨去，我们会请您吃晚饭。我们希望去那儿看看那座可以鸟瞰巴茨和克鲁瓦奇之间海湾的塔。”","“We will give you your dinner if you will show us the way along the shore to Batz, where we wish to see the tower which overlooks the bay between Batz and Croisic.”"
"“非常愿意。”他说，“你们先沿着现在所处的这条小径径直向前走，我收好渔具就去追你们。”","“With pleasure,” he said.“Go straight before you, along the path you are now on, and I will follow you when I have put away my tackle.”"
"我们点头同意，他便高高兴兴地向镇里跑去。这次相遇让我们保持了一贯的精神面貌，但是我们也因这次相遇少了几分欢乐。","We nodded consent, and he ran off joyfully toward the town.This meeting maintained us in our previous mental condition; but it lessened our gay lightheartedness."
"“可怜的人啊！”波利娜说道，语气中带着女人特有的同情，却没有令人不快的怜悯，“看到这样的苦难，难道我们不应该为自己的幸福感到羞愧吗？”","“Poor man!” said Pauline, with that accent which removes from the compassion of a woman all that is mortifying in human pity, “ought we not to feel ashamed of our happiness in presence of such misery?”"
"“没有任何事情比有心无力更残忍、更痛苦了。”我回答道，“那两个可怜的人，那位父亲和他的儿子将永远也不会了解我们对他们的同情有多么强烈，就像世人不知道他们的生活有多美丽一样——他们正在将财宝积攒于天堂。”","“Nothing is so cruelly painful as to have powerless desires,” I answered.“Those two poor creatures, the father and son, will never know how keen our sympathy for them is, any more than the world will know how beautiful are their lives; they are laying up their treasures in heaven.”"
"“唉，多么穷苦的村庄啊！”她指着一块石墙围绕的田地说。田地上规则地堆积着一团团牛粪。“我问一位正在忙着堆粪的农夫为什么要这么做，她回答说她正在做燃料。你能想象一下么？等那些粪堆干了，人们就会收集这些干粪并储存起来，用做燃料。冬天，这些干粪甚至可以像泥煤一样出售。你猜这里最好的裁缝能赚多少钱？——一天五苏！”波利娜顿了一下又说，“只包吃。”","“Oh, how poor this country is!” she said, pointing to a field enclosed by a dry stone wall, which was covered with droppings of cow’s dung applied symmetrically.“I asked a peasant-woman who was busy sticking them on, why it was done; she answered that she was making fuel.Could you have imagined that when those patches of dung have dried, human beings would collect them, store them, and use them for fuel?During the winter, they are even sold as peat is sold.And what do you suppose the best dressmaker in the place can earn?—five sous a day!” adding, after a pause, “and her food.”"
"“看！”我说，“海风是怎样扭曲、摧毁所有的东西的。这里没有树。布列塔尼盛产木柴，可是由于运费过高，人们根本用不起，所以遇难船只的残骸或是破旧船只的碎片就被卖给那些出得起钱的人。对于那些心灵高贵的人来说，这个地方才是好地方；情感冷淡的人是绝不会住在这里的；只有诗人和藤壶会在这儿栖身。这块岩石附近的人们全是被盐沼和盐厂吸引来的。岩石的一面是海，另一面是沙地，上面则是无边的天空。”","“But see,” I said, “how the winds from the sea bend or destroy everything.There are no trees.Fragments of wreckage or old vessels that are broken up are sold to those who can afford to buy; for costs of transportation are too heavy to allow them to use the firewood with which Brittany abounds.This region is fine for none but noble souls; persons without sentiments could never live here; poets and barnacles alone should inhabit it.All that ever brought a population to this rock were the salt-marshes and the factory which prepares the salt.On one side the sea; on the other, sand; above, illimitable space.”"
"我们穿过了城镇，来到了划分克鲁瓦奇和巴茨村庄的那片荒野上。想象一下，我亲爱的叔叔，数英里荒芜的小路被闪闪发光的海沙覆盖着。到处都有岩石翘首而立，就像昂首蹲伏在沙滩上的巨兽。海岸的边缘是礁石，礁石周围朵朵呈硕大的白玫瑰状的浪花或漂浮在海面，或停歇在岸边。我看到这片贫瘠的土地，一侧是大海，另一侧是海湾。海湾顺着克鲁瓦奇和盖朗德多岩石的海岸向远处延伸，海湾的起点是寸草不生的盐沼。我看向波利娜，问她是否有勇气面对炙热的太阳，是否有力气穿越沙地。","We had now passed the town, and had reached the species of desert which separates Croisic from the village of Batz.Imagine, my dear uncle, a barren track of miles covered with the glittering sand of the seashore.Here and there a few rocks lifted their heads; you might have thought them gigantic animals couchant on the dunes.Along the coast were reefs, around which the water foamed and sparkled, giving them the appearance of great white roses, floating on the liquid surface or resting on the shore.Seeing this barren tract with the ocean on one side, and on the other the arm of the sea which runs up between Croisic and the rocky shore of Guerande, at the base of which lay the salt marshes, denuded of vegetation, I looked at Pauline and asked her if she felt the courage to face the burning sun and the strength to walk through sand."
"“我穿的是靴子。”她说，“我们走。”她指向巴茨的那座塔，这座像金字塔一样矗立着的巨大建筑物，吸引着人们的眼球；不过它是一座细长、精致的金字塔，它颇有诗意的装饰会让人从它身上联想起亚洲名城中最久远的遗迹。","“I have boots,” she said.“Let us go,” and she pointed to the tower of Batz, which arrested the eye by its immense pile placed there like a pyramid; but a slender, delicately outlined pyramid, a pyramid so poetically ornate that the imagination figured in it the earliest ruin of a great Asiatic city."
"我们向前走了几步，坐在一块尚有阴凉的巨大岩石上。但是，这时是十一点，这块停在我们脚下的阴影很快就消失了。","We advanced a few steps and sat down upon the portion of a large rock which was still in the shade.But it was now eleven o’clock, and the shadow, which ceased at our feet, was disappearing rapidly."
"“这样的静谧是多么的美好啊！”波利娜对我说，“海浪在岸边来回颤抖的节奏使这份静谧变得更加深远。”","“How beautiful this silence!” she said to me; “and how the depth of it is deepened by the rhythmic quiver of the wave upon the shore.”"
"“如果你想感受一下包围着我们的三种物质——水、空气和沙子——的浩瀚， 全心全意聆听潮涨潮落那永不停歇的声音，”我回答她说，“你会受不了它们的演说；你会觉得它们正在讲述的观点能将你毁灭。昨天傍晚日落时，我就有那种感觉，它让我疲惫不堪。”","“If you will give your understanding to the three immensities which surround us, the water, the air, and the sands, and listen exclusively to the repeating sounds of flux and reflux,” I answered her, “you will not be able to endure their speech; you will think it is uttering a thought which will annihilate you.Last evening, at sunset, I had that sensation; and it exhausted me.”"
"“噢！我们聊聊吧。”她停了很长时间后说，“我明白这种感觉。没有比它们更厉害的演讲者。我想，”过了一会儿，波利娜继续说，“我理解了我们周遭事物和谐、融洽的原因。”这儿的风景有三种明亮的颜色：沙子的亮黄色，天空的蓝色和大海的纯绿色。这种风景宏大但不粗野，广袤但不荒凉，单调但不让人厌烦，它仅有三种元素，却变幻无穷。”","“Oh! let us talk, let us talk,” she said, after a long pause.“I understand it.No orator was ever more terrible.I think,” she continued, presently, “that I perceive the causes of the harmonies which surround us.This landscape, which has but three marked colors,—the brilliant yellow of the sands, the blue of the sky, the even green of the sea,—is grand without being savage; it is immense, yet not a desert; it is monotonous, but it does not weary; it has only three elements, and yet it is varied.”"
"“只有女人知道如何描绘这种感觉。”我说，“我深深挚爱的心灵，你让诗人也黯然失色。”","“Women alone know how to render such impressions,” I said.“You would be the despair of a poet, dear soul that I divine so well!”"
"“中午的炎炎烈日赋予了这三种有限的表现物无比强烈的色彩。”波利娜笑着说，“我可以在这里体会到东方的诗意和激情。”","“The extreme heat of mid-day casts into those three expressions of the infinite an all-powerful color,” said Pauline, smiling.“I can here conceive the poesy and the passion of the East.”"
"“而我却能感到这里的绝望。”","“And I can perceive its despair.”"
"“是的。”波利娜说，“这块沙丘像是一座修道院——一座壮观的修道院。”","“Yes,” she said, “this dune is a cloister,—a sublime cloister.”"
"现在，我们听到向导急促的脚步声；他已经穿上了最好的衣服。我们和他寒暄了几句，他以为我们心情变坏了，就抱着人逢不幸时会有的那种拘谨的态度，保持着沉默。我们不时地紧握彼此的手，感受彼此的思想和感情。也许是由于滚烫的沙子散发着的灼热使我们感到压抑，也许是由于前行中的困难吸引了我们的注意力，我们沉默着走了半个小时。我们像孩子一样握着彼此的手。事实上，若不是我们手挽着手，我们连十二步路都走不了。通向巴茨的路很浅。一阵风就足以把车辙或马蹄留下的印迹抚平，但是我们向导的眼睛训练有素，他根据碎泥块和牛粪来辨别道路。这条路先是朝大海一路下坡，然后顺着地势、绕开一堆堆岩石障碍，向着内陆一直上行。到中午的时候，我们才走了一半的路。","We now heard the hurried steps of our guide; he had put on his Sunday clothes.We addressed a few ordinary words to him; he seemed to think that our mood had changed, and with that reserve that comes of misery, he kept silence.Though from time to time we pressed each other’s hands that we might feel the mutual flow of our ideas and impressions, we walked along for half an hour in silence, either because we were oppressed by the heat which rose in waves from the burning sands, or because the difficulty of walking absorbed our attention.Like children, we held each other’s hands; in fact, we could hardly have made a dozen steps had we walked arm in arm.The path which led to Batz was not so much as traced.A gust of wind was enough to efface all tracks left by the hoofs of horses or the wheels of carts; but the practiced eye of our guide could recognize by scraps of mud or the dung of cattle the road that crossed that desert, now descending towards the sea, then rising landward according to either the fall of the ground or the necessity of rounding some breastwork of rock.By mid-day, we were only half way."
"“我们到那儿停下来休息一下。”我边说边指向一个由岩石组成的海岬。海岬很高，也许我们会在那儿找到一个山洞。","“We will stop to rest over there,” I said, pointing to a promontory of rocks sufficiently high to make it probable we should find a grotto."
"渔夫听了我说的话，看向我指着的方向，摇了摇头，说道：","The fisherman, who heard me and saw the direction in which I pointed, shook his head, and said,—"
"“那里有人。”从巴茨到克鲁瓦奇或者从克鲁瓦奇到巴茨的所有人都会绕道而行，没有人从那儿走。”","“Some one is there.All those who come from the village of Batz to Croisic, or from Croisic to Batz, go round that place; they never pass it.”"
"渔夫说话的声音很低，似乎在暗示着有什么秘密。","These words were said in a low voice, and seemed to indicate a mystery."
"“他是谁？——是一个强盗，还是一个杀人犯？”","“Who is he,—a robber, a murderer?”"
"我们的向导没有回答，只是深深地吸了口气，这使我们的好奇心又长了一倍。","Our guide answered only by drawing a deep breath, which redoubled our curiosity."
"“可是，如果我们从那儿路过，我们会受到什么伤害吗？”","“But if we pass that way, would any harm happen to us?”"
"“哦，不会的！”","“Oh, no!”"
"“您和我们一起去吗？”","“Will you go with us?”"
"“不了，先生。”","“No, monsieur.”"
"“如果您确保那儿不会有什么危险，我们就去。”","“We will go, if you assure us there is no danger.”"
"“我可没这样说。”渔夫匆忙地回答，“我只是说那儿的那个人不会和你们说话，不会伤害你们。他从没离开那儿半步。”","“I do not say so,” replied the fisherman, hastily.“I only say that he who is there will say nothing to you, and do you no harm.He never so much as moves from his place.”"
"“他是谁？”","“Who is it?”"
"“一个男人。”","“A man.”"
"这几个音节从没被人用这样悲惨的音调说出来过。此刻，我们距离那块巨大的岩石有五十英尺远，岩石延伸到海中，成了一条长长的岩礁。我们的向导走绕过岩石底部的一条路。我们则继续前行，走跨过岩石的路，波利娜挽起了我的胳膊。为了能在两条道路的交汇处和我们会合，我们的向导加快了脚步。","Never were two syllables pronounced in so tragic a manner.At this moment we were about fifty feet from the rocky eminence, which extended a long reef into the sea.Our guide took a path which led him round the base of the rock.We ourselves continued our way over it; but Pauline took my arm.Our guide hastened his steps in order to meet us on the other side, where the two paths came together again."
"这种情景激起了我们的好奇心。不久，好奇心变得更加强烈，我们好像觉得害怕似的，心里开始怦怦跳动起来。尽管天气很热，我们在沙子上走得也很累，我们的心灵却仍然沉浸在极度的喜悦之中，感到了一种无法言说的轻快。我们心中充满了纯真的快乐，它很难形容，只能拿我们听动听的乐曲时的欢愉来与之相比。比如说莫扎特的《来吧，我的爱！》。但两种纯真的感情交融在一起时，不就是两副美妙的歌喉吗？为了能恰当地享受支配着我们的感情，我们分享了今晨所见之事触动我们心灵的那种感觉。当你久久观赏着一只栖息在泉边的一条摇摆的树枝上、浑身上下色彩绚丽的斑鸠时，若是看到一只雀鹰猛扑下去，用它钢铁般的爪子刺进它的喉咙，以迅雷不及掩耳之势将它带走，你就会禁不住发出一声惨叫。我们向前走了一两步，来到了一块空地上，空地后面貌似有个山洞。空地高出大西洋一百英尺，陡峭的石壁保护着空地，让它免受海浪的猛烈冲撞。我们突然感觉到了一种触电般的战栗，就像是我们在深更半夜被一阵突如其来的声音惊醒一样。","This circumstance excited our curiosity, which soon became so keen that our hearts were beating as if with a sense of fear.In spite of the heat of the day, and the fatigue caused by toiling through the sand, our souls were still surrendered to the softness unspeakable of our exquisite ecstasy.They were filled with that pure pleasure which cannot be described unless we liken it to the joy of listening to enchanting music, Mozart’s “Audiamo mio ben,” for instance.When two pure sentiments blend together, what is that but two sweet voices singing?To be able to appreciate properly the emotion that held us, it would be necessary to share the state of half sensuous delight into which the events of the morning had plunged us.Admire for a long time some pretty dove with iridescent colors, perched on a swaying branch above a spring, and you will give a cry of pain when you see a hawk swooping down upon her, driving its steel claws into her breast, and bearing her away with murderous rapidity.When we had advanced a step or two into an open space which lay before what seemed to be a grotto, a sort of esplanade placed a hundred feet above the ocean, and protected from its fury by buttresses of rock, we suddenly experienced an electrical shudder, something resembling the shock of a sudden noise awaking us in the dead of night."
"这是因为我们看到一个男人坐在一大块花岗岩上，正在朝我们瞥来。他那一瞥犹如从一双血红的眼睛迸发出来的炮火；他纹丝不动，只有周围亘古不变的花岗岩可以与之相比。他缓缓移动着眼睛，身体却僵直不变，就像石化了一样。瞥了那让我们震颤的一眼之后，他将目光又一次投向无垠的海洋，凝视着它。尽管海上光线炫目，他却宛如凝视着太阳的苍鹰，没有闭上眼睛。亲爱的叔叔，请用心想一想那些老橡树里的一棵，虽然树枝被削剪过，满是结节的树身还是以奇异的力量挺立在荒凉之处，这样你就会想象出这个男人的样子。他的形象有如一个斗败的大力士，相貌仿佛威严的朱庇特。岁月的流逝、海上的苦工、内心的悲痛、粗劣的饮食压垮了他，他黑得像是被闪电劈中了一样。我看着他那双粗糙的、毛茸茸的手，只见筋腱像一根根铁条一般突了出来。关于他的一切都说明他体格强壮。我注意到在山洞的一角长着一些苔藓，在一块天然形成的花岗岩岩脊上放着一块面包，面包盖在一只陶壶的嘴上。这让我想起了早期基督教隐修士生活的荒漠，但是我的想象中却找不到比这个人更虔诚、更有忏悔之心的形象。亲爱的叔叔，虽然您一生都在忏悔，您却或许从未见过带着如此深重悔恨的表情——这种悔恨已淹没在一阵阵祷告中，这些无穷无尽的代祷出自无声无息的绝望。这个渔夫，这个水手，这个身体壮实、皮肤粗糙的布列塔尼人，他通过一些隐匿的情感得到了升华。这双眼睛是否流过泪？那双手仿佛是为未经雕琢的塑像量身定做的，它们曾经打过人吗？那对饱经沧桑的眉毛上镌刻着粗蛮的荣耀，眉间不仅带着力量，也留有温柔的痕迹，这种温柔是一切真正的力量的象征。那个爬满皱纹的前额是否反映了他的内心呢？这个人为什么要置身花岗岩中呢？这块花岗岩为什么嵌在这个人心里呢？哪一个是人？哪一个是花岗岩？我们的思绪飘入了幻想的世界。按照向导的预告，我们悄无声息地快速经过那儿；当他遇到我们时，他看到我们的情感中流露着惶恐和惊诧，但是他没有为自己的预言准确而自夸；他仅仅说道：","We saw, sitting on a vast granite boulder, a man who looked at us.His glance, like that of the flash of a cannon, came from two bloodshot eyes, and his stoical immobility could be compared only to the immutable granite masses that surrounded him.His eyes moved slowly, his body remaining rigid as though he were petrified.Then, having cast upon us that look which struck us like a blow, he turned his eyes once more to the limitless ocean, and gazed upon it, in spite of its dazzling light, as eagles gaze at the sun, without lowering his eyelids.Try to remember, dear uncle, one of those old oaks, whose knotty trunks, from which the branches have been lopped, rise with weird power in some lonely place, and you will have an image of this man.Here was a ruined Herculean frame, the face of an Olympian Jove, destroyed by age, by hard sea toil, by grief, by common food, and blackened as it were by lightning.Looking at his hard and hairy hands, I saw that the sinews stood out like cords of iron.Everything about him denoted strength of constitution.I noticed in a corner of the grotto a quantity of moss, and on a sort of ledge carved by nature on the granite, a loaf of bread, which covered the mouth of an earthenware jug.Never had my imagination, when it carried me to the deserts where early Christian anchorites spent their lives, depicted to my mind a form more grandly religious nor more horribly repentant than that of this man.You, who have a life-long experience of the confessional, dear uncle, you may never, perhaps, have seen so awful a remorse,—remorse sunk in the waves of prayer, the ceaseless supplication of a mute despair.This fisherman, this mariner, this hard, coarse Breton, was sublime through some hidden emotion.Had those eyes wept?That hand, molded for an unwrought statue, had it struck?That ragged brow, where savage honor was imprinted, and on which strength had left vestiges of the gentleness which is an attribute of all true strength, that forehead furrowed with wrinkles, was it in harmony with the heart within?Why was this man in the granite?Why was the granite in the man?Which was the man, which was the granite?A world of fancies came into our minds.As our guide had prophesied, we passed in silence, rapidly; when he met us he saw our emotion of mingled terror and astonishment, but he made no boast of the truth of his prediction; he merely said,—"
"“你们见过他了。”","“You have seen him.”"
"“那个人是谁？”","“Who is that man?”"
"“人们叫他‘践约者’。”","“They call him the Man of the Vow.”"
"你可以想象出我们俩一齐将头转向向导的这个动作。他是一个纯朴的人，马上明白了我们无声的询问。下面是他告诉我们的内容。我将尽可能将故事用他的原话呈现出来，以便保留他那通俗的用语。","You can imagine the movement with which our two heads turned at once to our guide.He was a simple-hearted fellow; he understood at once our mute inquiry, and here follows what he told us; I shall try to give it as best I can in his own language, retaining his popular parlance."
"“夫人，克鲁瓦奇人和巴茨人以为这个人犯过罪，曾经到比南特更远的地方找到一位著名的神父进行忏悔，现在正在按神父的指示在赎罪。另外一些人认为康伯勒迈——这是他的名字——会给从他身边路过的人带来厄运。因此，他们穿过这块岩石之前总会观察风向。如果是西北风，他们就不再前行，除非他们想专程尝尝什么是真正的苦恼。除此之外 ，他们都会战战兢兢地返回去。这些人是克鲁瓦奇的富人，他们说康伯勒迈立过誓约，这就是人们称之为‘践约者’的原因。他日日夜夜呆在那儿，从未离开过这个地方。所有的说法都有一定的真实性。看那边，”他继续说道，转身指给我们看了看我们没有注意到的东西，“看左边，看他在那儿竖的那只木质十字架，这表明他把自己置于天主、圣母和圣徒的保护之下。因为人们害怕他，他反而安全了，仿佛是受到了一群军队的保护一样。自从他像这样在把自己露天关闭起来，他就从来没有说过一句话；他以面包和水为生，这些东西是他哥哥的女儿每天早上给他送来的。这个小女孩大概十二岁，非常漂亮，像羊羔一样温顺。她是个很好的小女孩，可爱极了，他把自己全部的财产都给了她。她有着一双蓝眼睛，有这么大。”他补充道，用自己的大拇指比划了下，“她有着天使般的头发。当你问她：‘告诉我，佩罗特。’——我们这一带管皮耶雷特都是这么叫的，”他插进去说道，“她已经向圣皮埃尔（注：“圣皮埃尔”即“圣彼得”）发过誓；康伯勒迈是她的教父，名叫皮埃尔——‘告诉我，佩罗特，你叔叔对你说什么了？’——‘他什么也没对我说，什么也没有。’——‘好吧，那么，他对你做什么了?’‘每个星期天他都在我额头上亲一下。’——‘你害怕他吗？’——‘啊，不，不害怕；他难道不是我的教父吗？除我之外，他不让任何人给他送饭。’佩罗特说她来了，他就微笑；但是你或许会说这好比是大雾中的一缕阳光——他就像阴天一样阴沉沉的。”“可是，”我对他说，“您激起了我们的好奇心却又没有满足它。您知道是什么事情让他来到这儿的吗？是悲伤？还是悔改？是癫狂？是罪行？还是？”","“Madame, folks from Croisic and those from Batz think this man is guilty of something, and is doing a penance ordered by a famous rector to whom he confessed his sin somewhere beyond Nantes.Others think that Cambremer, that’s his name, casts an evil fate on those who come within his air, and so they always look which way the wind is before they pass this rock.If it’s nor’-westerly they wouldn’t go by, no, not if their errand was to get a bit of the true cross; they’d go back, frightened.Others—they are the rich folks of Croisic—they say that Cambremer has made a vow, and that’s why people call him the Man of the Vow.He is there night and day, he never leaves the place.All these sayings have some truth in them.See there,” he continued, turning round to show us a thing we had not remarked, “look at that wooden cross he has set up there, to the left, to show that he has put himself under the protection of God and the holy Virgin and the saints.But the fear that people have of him keeps him as safe as if he were guarded by a troop of soldiers.He has never said one word since he locked himself up in the open air in this way; he lives on bread and water, which is brought to him every morning by his brother’s daughter, a little lass about twelve years old to whom he has left his property, a pretty creature, gentle as a lamb, a nice little girl, so pleasant.She has such blue eyes, long as THAT,” he added, marking a line on his thumb, “and hair like the cherubim.When you ask her: ‘Tell me, Perotte’ (That’s how we say Pierette in these parts,” he remarked, interrupting himself; “she is vowed to Saint Pierre; Cambremer is named Pierre, and he was her godfather)—‘Tell me, Perotte, what does your uncle say to you?’—‘He says nothing to me, nothing.’—‘Well, then, what does he do to you?’‘He kisses me on the forehead, Sundays.’—‘Are you afraid of him?’—‘Ah, no, no; isn’t he my godfather? he wouldn’t have anybody but me bring him his food.’Perotte declares that he smiles when she comes; but you might as well say the sun shines in a fog; he’s as gloomy as a cloudy day.”“But,” I said to him, “you excite our curiosity without satisfying it.Do you know what brought him there?Was it grief, or repentance; is it a mania; is it crime, is it—”"
"“唉，先生，除了父亲和我，任何人都不知道真相。先母曾在一位律师家做仆人，康伯勒迈按照神父的指示把所有事情都告诉了律师，只有这样做神父才愿意为他赦罪——至少，港口的人是这么说的。我可怜的母亲无意中听到了康伯勒迈的话。律师家的厨房紧挨着书房，所以她听到了。我的母亲去世了，律师也去世了。我的母亲让我和我父亲发誓绝不和当地人谈论这事。但是我可以告诉你们，她跟我们讲这个故事的晚上，我的头发都立起来了。”","“Eh, monsieur, there’s no one but my father and I who know the real truth.My late mother was servant in the family of a lawyer to whom Cambremer told all by order of the priest, who wouldn’t give him absolution until he had done so—at least, that’s what the folks of the port say.My poor mother overheard Cambremer without trying to; the lawyer’s kitchen was close to the office, and that’s how she heard.She’s dead, and so is the lawyer.My mother made us promise, my father and I, not to talk about the matter to the folks of the neighborhood; but I can tell you my hair stood on end the night she told us the tale.”"
"“那么，小伙子，现在告诉我们吧，我们不会对别人说的。”","“Well, my man, tell it to us now, and we won’t speak of it.”"
"渔夫看了看我们，继续说道：","The fisherman looked at us; then he continued:"
"“你们在那里见过的人叫皮埃尔·康伯勒迈，是康伯勒迈家的老大，他们家从父辈到子辈都是水手。正像他们的名字所说的那样——大海都在他们面前屈服。皮埃尔是个去深海捕鱼的渔夫。他有渔船，捕捞沙丁鱼和一些大鱼，然后卖给商人。要不是如此深爱他的妻子，他早就打造一艘大船去捕鳕鱼了。他妻子是个美丽的女人，是盖朗德镇布鲁安家的人，心肠很好。她深爱着康伯勒迈，无法忍受丈夫离开她的时间比去捕沙丁鱼的时间还要长。看！康伯勒迈和他的妻子就住在那儿。”渔夫说着便爬上一座小丘，向我们指了指一块小内海中的一座岛屿。这块小内海位于我们走过的沙丘和盖朗德沼泽之间。“你们能从这儿看到那座房子。房子是康伯勒迈的。雅凯特·布鲁安和康伯勒迈只有一个儿子，他们爱这个孩子——我该怎么说呢？——啊，他们像爱独生子一样爱这个孩子，他们疯狂地爱着他。多少次我们都在集市上看到他们买各种各样的玩意来哄他开心。他们溺爱他的方式是不明智的，人们都这么说。小康伯勒迈看见自己要什么就有什么，就变得像只红毛驴那么坏。当人们告诉康伯勒迈老爹‘您儿子差点杀了某个孩子’时，他会笑笑说：‘呸！这孩子会成为一个勇敢的水手，他将指挥国王的舰队。’——另一次，有人对他说：‘皮埃尔·康伯勒迈，您知道您的孩子差点戳伤了小姑娘普戈的眼睛吗？’——‘哈！他以后会喜欢女孩的。’皮埃尔说。皮埃尔什么也不愁。这个小杂种，十岁大就和每个人打过架，以割断鸡脖、手裂生猪为乐。事实上，您可以说他嗜血如命。‘他将成为一名出色的军人。’康伯勒迈说，‘他喜欢鲜血的味道。’你们看，”渔夫说，“我现在能回想起所有的事——当然康伯勒迈也记得这些事。”他停了一会，补充道，“雅克·康伯勒迈十五六岁的时候就变成了——我该怎么说呢？——一个骗子。他在盖朗德镇消遣娱乐，在萨沃奈镇泡妞。然后，他想要钱。他抢自己母亲的钱，而他母亲不敢对他父亲提一个字。康伯勒迈是一个正直的人，要是有人多付给他两个苏，他会徒步走上五十英里去退钱。终有一天，这位母亲的所有东西都被抢走了。雅克趁他父亲下海捕鱼的时候，拿走了他母亲的所有东西：家具、毛毯、平底锅、被单、内衣等等所有的东西。他变卖了这些东西去了南特，在那儿继续他的恶行。这位可怜的母亲昼夜哭泣。这次，她瞒不住丈夫了，她害怕丈夫——但不是为自己而害怕，这一点是可以肯定的。皮埃尔·康伯勒迈回到家，看到邻居们借给她妻子的家具，便问：","“Pierre Cambremer, whom you have seen there, is the eldest of the Cambremers, who from father to son have always been sailors; their name says it—the sea bends under them.Pierre was a deep-sea fisherman.He had boats, and fished for sardine, also for the big fishes, and sold them to dealers.He’d have charted a large vessel and trawled for cod if he hadn’t loved his wife so much; she was a fine woman, a Brouin of Guerande, with a good heart.She loved Cambremer so much that she couldn’t bear to have her man leave her for longer than to fish sardine.They lived over there, look!” said the fisherman, going up a hillock to show us an island in the little Mediterranean between the dunes where we were walking and the marshes of Guerande.“You can see the house from here.It belonged to him.Jacquette Brouin and Cambremer had only one son, a lad they loved—how shall I say?—well, they loved him like an only child, they were mad about him.How many times we have seen them at fairs buying all sorts of things to please him; it was out of all reason the way they indulged him, and so folks told them.The little Cambremer, seeing that he was never thwarted, grew as vicious as a red ass.When they told pere Cambremer, ‘Your son has nearly killed little such a one,’ he would laugh and say: ‘Bah! he’ll be a bold sailor; he’ll command the king’s fleets.’—Another time, ‘Pierre Cambremer, did you know your lad very nearly put out the eye of the little Pougard girl?’—‘Ha! he’ll like the girls,’ said Pierre.Nothing troubled him.At ten years old the little cur fought everybody, and amused himself with cutting the hens’ necks off and ripping up the pigs; in fact, you might say he wallowed in blood.‘He’ll be a famous soldier,’ said Cambremer, ‘he’s got the taste of blood.’Now, you see,” said the fisherman, “I can look back and remember all that—and Cambremer, too,” he added, after a pause.“By the time Jacques Cambremer was fifteen or sixteen years of age he had come to be—what shall I say?—a shark.He amused himself at Guerande, and was after the girls at Savenay.Then he wanted money.He robbed his mother, who didn’t dare say a word to his father.Cambremer was an honest man who’d have tramped fifty miles to return two sous that any one had overpaid him on a bill.At last, one day the mother was robbed of everything.During one of his father’s fishing-trips Jacques carried off all she had, furniture, pots and pans, sheets, linen, everything; he sold it to go to Nantes and carry on his capers there.The poor mother wept day and night.This time it couldn’t be hidden from the father, and she feared him—not for herself, you may be sure of that.When Pierre Cambremer came back and saw furniture in his house which the neighbors had lent to his wife, he said,—"
"“‘这是怎么回事？’","“‘What is all this?’"
"“这个被吓得半死的可怜女人回答说：","“The poor woman, more dead than alive, replied:"
"“‘我们被抢了。’","“‘We have been robbed.’"
"“‘雅克在哪？’","“‘Where is Jacques?’"
"“‘雅克出去玩了。’","“‘Jacques is off amusing himself.’"
"“没人知道这个恶棍去哪儿了。","“No one knew where the scoundrel was."
"“‘他玩得太过分了。’皮埃尔说。","“‘He amuses himself too much,’ said Pierre."
"“六个月后，这位可怜的父亲听说他的儿子即将被南特警方逮捕。他步行到南特，速度比乘船还要快。他抓住儿子，硬把他拽回了家。回到家后，他没有问他的儿子‘你都干了什么？’但是他说：","“Six months later the poor father heard that his son was about to be arrested in Nantes.He walked there on foot, which is faster than by sea, put his hands on his son, and compelled him to return home.Once here, he did not ask him, ‘What have you done?’ but he said:—"
"“‘如果你不老实地与你母亲和我呆在家里下海打鱼，做个正直的人，你就等着我找你算账吧。’","“‘If you do not conduct yourself properly at home with your mother and me, and go fishing, and behave like an honest man, you and I will have a reckoning.’"
"“这个疯小子以为他的父母很愚蠢，便做了个鬼脸，这使得他挨了皮埃尔一个耳光，打得他在床上躺了六个星期。那位可怜的母亲差点伤心死。一天晚上，她正在丈夫身边安稳地睡着，一阵噪音吵醒了她。她迅速起身，却被一把刀子刺进了胳膊。她大叫一声。皮埃尔·康伯勒迈点亮了灯，看到他的妻子受了伤，他以为是贼干的——就像我们这儿以前出现过的一样，不过现在，您大可以带一千法郎金币从克鲁瓦奇到圣纳泽尔去，而不用担心别人会问你腋下夹的是什么东西。皮埃尔去找他的儿子，但是没有找到。早上，那个魔鬼没有脸回家，说他在巴茨呆了整个晚上！我得告诉你们，她母亲不懂该把钱藏在哪里。康伯勒迈把他的钱放在克鲁瓦奇的迪波泰先生家里。到了这一出，儿子的恶行已经让他们付出了很大的代价，几乎让他们倾家荡产。这对于一个曾经拥有一万两千法郎和自己的小岛的人来说是非常残酷的。没有人知道康伯勒迈在南特为了让他的儿子回家花了多少钱。厄运似乎在紧紧地追随着这个家庭。康伯勒迈的兄弟也遇到了麻烦，需要人帮助。皮埃尔安慰他兄弟说，雅克以后可以和佩罗特（康伯勒迈兄弟的女儿）结婚。后来，为了帮助约瑟夫·康伯勒迈谋生，皮埃尔带他去打鱼，因为可怜的约瑟夫现在必须靠自己每日的劳动才能生活。约瑟夫的妻子死于热病，因此约瑟夫得出钱为佩罗特请奶妈。皮埃尔·康伯勒迈的妻子得为小女孩向不同的人支付内衣、衣服等各种费用共约一百法郎。于是，她把一块西班牙金币缝在自己的被褥里当成付这些钱的储备金。金币外面包着纸，纸上写着‘给佩罗特’。雅凯特·布鲁安受过良好的教育，能像记事员一样写一手好字，她也还教过她的儿子写字。我不知道这个恶棍是怎样嗅出金币的味道的，他偷走了金币，然后到克鲁瓦奇尽情玩乐。一切像是注定的一样，皮埃尔·康伯勒迈那天划船回家，上岸后看见一张纸浮在水面上。他把纸捡了起来，看了一眼便拿给他的妻子，他的妻子一见是自己的笔迹，就仰天倒了下去。康伯勒迈什么也没说就去了克鲁瓦奇，他听说他儿子正在玩台球，便走到咖啡店的女掌柜身边，对她说：","“The crazy fellow, counting on his parent’s folly, made a face; on which Pierre struck him a blow which sent Jacques to his bed for six weeks.The poor mother nearly died of grief.One night, as she was fast asleep beside her husband, a noise awoke her; she rose up quickly, and was stabbed in the arm with a knife.She cried out loud, and when Pierre Cambremer struck a light and saw his wife wounded, he thought it was the doing of robbers,—as if we ever had any in these parts, where you might carry ten thousand francs in gold from Croisic to Saint-Nazaire without ever being asked what you had in your arms.Pierre looked for his son, but he could not find him.In the morning, if that monster didn’t have the face to come home, saying he had stayed at Batz all night!I should tell you that the mother had not known where to hide her money.Cambremer put his with Monsieur Dupotel at Croisic.Their son’s follies had by this time cost them so much that they were half-ruined, and that was hard for folks who once had twelve thousand francs, and who owned their island.No one ever knew what Cambremer paid at Nantes to get his son away from there.Bad luck seemed to follow the family.Troubles fell upon Cambremer’s brother, he needed help.Pierre said, to console him, that Jacques and Perotte (the brother’s daughter) could be married.Then, to help Joseph Cambremer to earn his bread, Pierre took him with him a-fishing; for the poor man was now obliged to live by his daily labor.His wife was dead of the fever, and money was owing for Perotte’s nursing.The wife of Pierre Cambremer owed about one hundred francs to divers persons for the little girl,—linen, clothes, and what not,—and it so chanced that she had sewed a bit of Spanish gold into her mattress for a nest—egg toward paying off that money.It was wrapped in paper, and on the paper was written by her: ‘For Perotte.’Jacquette Brouin had had a fine education; she could write like a clerk, and had taught her son to write too.I can’t tell you how it was that the villain scented the gold, stole it, and went off to Croisic to enjoy himself.Pierre Cambremer, as if it was ordained, came back that day in his boat; as he landed he saw a bit of paper floating in the water, and he picked it up, looked at it, and carried it to his wife, who fell down as if dead, seeing her own writing.Cambremer said nothing, but he went to Croisic, and heard that his son was in a billiard room; so then he went to the mistress of the cafe, and said to her:—"
"“‘我曾告诉过雅克不要用这枚金币付账，把金币还给我吧，我用银币代替金币付账。’","“‘I told Jacques not to use a piece of gold with which he will pay you; give it back to me, and I’ll give you white money in place of it.’"
"“这位好心的女人按照康伯勒迈说的把金币还给了他。康伯勒迈接过钱，只说了句‘好’便回家了。上面所讲的是全镇人都知道的事，但是下面我要说的就只有我一个人知道，尽管其他人也多少有所猜测。如我所说，康伯勒迈回到家，让他的妻子把底层的卧室打扫干净。他生了火，点了两支蜡烛，在壁炉的一边放了两张椅子，在另一边放了一张凳子。然后他让他的妻子拿出他的结婚礼服，又让她穿上自己的结婚礼服。他也穿上礼服。他穿戴好后，就接来了他的兄弟。他要求他的兄弟在门前看着，不论是克鲁瓦奇海滩还是盖朗德海滩，只要一有动静就马上通知他。他上好枪后，把枪放在了壁炉的一角。雅克很晚才回家，他连喝带赌直到十点，所以不得不从卡尔努夫海岬那边赶回来。他叔叔听到了他的叫喊声，走过去把他接回来，但是什么也没说。雅克进屋时，他父亲对他说：","“The good woman did as she was told.Cambremer took the money and just said ‘Good,’ and then he went home.So far, all the town knows that; but now comes what I alone know, though others have always had some suspicion of it.As I say, Cambremer came home; he told his wife to clean up their chamber, which is on the lower floor; he made a fire, lit two candles, placed two chairs on one side of the hearth, and a stool on the other.Then he told his wife to bring him his wedding-clothes, and ordered her to put on hers.He dressed himself.When dressed, he fetched his brother, and told him to watch before the door, and warn him of any noise on either of the beaches,—that of Croisic, or that of Guerande.Then he loaded a gun, and placed it at a corner of the fireplace.Jacques came home late; he had drunk and gambled till ten o’clock, and had to get back by way of the Carnouf point.His uncle heard his hail, and he went over and fetched him, but said nothing.When Jacques entered the house, his father said to him,—"
"“‘坐在这儿。’他父亲指了指木凳。‘你，’他父亲说，‘冒犯了你面前的父母，现在我们要审判你。’","“‘Sit there,’ pointing to the stool.‘You are,’ he said, ‘before your father and mother, whom you have offended, and who will now judge you.’"
"“雅克开始吼叫起来，因为他看见他父亲的脸已经完全扭曲了。她母亲像船桨一样僵着。","“At this Jacques began to howl, for his father’s face was all distorted.His mother was rigid as an oar."
"“‘如果你大叫、乱动，或是不安安静静地坐在凳子上，’皮埃尔用枪对准他说，‘我就像打死狗一样打死你。’","“‘If you shout, if you stir, if you do not sit still on that stool,’ said Pierre, aiming the gun at him, ‘I will shoot you like a dog.’"
"“雅克噤若寒蝉。他母亲也什么都没说。","“Jacques was mute as a fish.The mother said nothing."
"“‘看，’皮埃尔说，‘这是一张包着西班牙金币的纸。金币本来是藏在你母亲的床里的，只有她自己知道藏在哪里。我今天上岸时，在海里发现了这张纸。今天晚上，你给弗勒朗大妈一枚西班牙金币，而你母亲的那枚金币却不见了。你解释一下这是怎么回事。’","“‘Here,’ said Pierre, ‘is a piece of paper which wrapped a Spanish gold piece.That piece of gold was in your mother’s bed; she alone knew where it was.I found that paper in the water when I landed here to-day.You gave a piece of Spanish gold this night to Mere Fleurant, and your mother’s piece is no longer in her bed.Explain all this.’"
"“雅克说他没拿母亲的钱，那枚金币是他从南特带回来的。","“Jacques said he had not taken his mother’s money, and that the gold piece was one he had brought from Nantes."
"“‘非常好。’皮埃尔说，‘那就证明一下你的话吧。’","“‘I am glad of it,’ said Pierre; ‘now prove it.’"
"“‘金币一直就是我的。’","“‘I had it all along.’"
"“‘你没拿走母亲的那枚金币吗？’","“‘You did not take the gold piece belonging to your mother?’"
"“‘没有。’","“‘No.’"
"“‘你能用你的性命作担保吗？’","“‘Will you swear it on your eternal life?’"
"“他正要发誓，母亲抬眼看向他说：","“He was about to swear; his mother raised her eyes to him, and said:—"
"“‘雅克，我的孩子，小心啊！如果不是真的就不要起誓。你可以忏悔、改过，还有时间。’","“‘Jacques, my child, take care; do not swear if it is not true; you can repent, you can amend; there is still time.’"
"“她哭了。","“And she wept."
"“‘你不是这儿有一枚金币就是那儿有一枚金币。’雅克说，‘你总是想要毁掉我。’","“‘You are a this and a that,’ he said; ‘you have always wanted to ruin me.’"
"“康伯勒迈的脸变得惨白，他说：","“Cambremer turned white and said,—"
"“你那样对你母亲说话就加深了你的罪孽。回到正题上！你要发誓吗？’","“‘Such language to your mother increases your crime.Come, to the point!Will you swear?’"
"“‘要发誓。’","“‘Yes.’"
"“‘那么，’皮埃尔说，‘你的那枚金币上有小十字架吗？沙丁鱼商人付给我金币时，在上面刻了个十字架。’","“‘Then,’ Pierre said, ‘was there upon your gold piece the little cross which the sardine merchant who paid it to me scratched on ours?’"
"“‘雅克一下子就垮了，他哭了。","“Jacques broke down and wept."
"“‘够了。’皮埃尔说，‘我就不提你以前犯下的罪行了。我不希望一个姓康伯勒迈的人死在断头台上。你祷告吧，要快些。神父马上就过来听你忏悔。’","“‘Enough,’ said Pierre.‘I shall not speak to you of the crimes you have committed before this.I do not choose that a Cambremer should die on a scaffold.Say your prayers and make haste.A priest is coming to confess you.’"
"“母亲离开了房间。她不想听到儿子被如此责备。雅克的母亲离开后，他的叔叔约瑟夫·康伯勒迈带来了皮拉克神父，雅克什么也没对神父说。他很狡猾，他知道只要自己不忏悔，父亲就不会杀他。","“The mother had left the room; she could not hear her son condemned.After she had gone, Joseph Cambremer, the uncle, brought in the rector of Piriac, to whom Jacques would say nothing.He was shrewd; he knew his father would not kill him until he had made his confession."
"“‘谢谢您，请原谅我们。’康伯勒迈看雅克很固执，便对神父说，‘我想教训下我的儿子，所以请求您不要对任何人提起此事。至于你，’他对雅克说，‘如果你不改正，下一次将会是你犯的最后一次罪行。不用忏悔，我照样会了结你的性命。’","“‘Thank you, and excuse us,’ said Cambremer to the priest, when he saw Jacques’ obstinacy.‘I wished to give a lesson to my son, and will ask you to say nothing about it.As for you,’ he said to Jacques, ‘if you do not amend, the next offence you commit will be your last; I shall end it without confession.’"
"“他父亲让他睡觉去。这个家伙以为可以继续左右他的父亲。他便睡下了。他的父亲看着他。康伯勒迈看到他儿子已经睡熟，便用粗麻布堵住他的嘴，用眼罩紧紧地罩住他的眼睛，接着捆住他的手脚——‘他发了疯，两眼滴血。’我的母亲听到康伯勒迈是这样对律师说的。那位母亲瘫软在那位父亲的脚下。","“And he sent him to bed.The lad thought he could still get round his father.He slept.His father watched.When he saw that his son was soundly asleep, he covered his mouth with tow, blindfolded him tightly, bound him hand and foot—‘He raged, he wept blood,’ my mother heard Cambremer say to the lawyer.The mother threw herself at the father’s feet."
"“‘他受到了审判并且被判有罪。’皮埃尔说，‘你现在必须帮我把他抬到船上。’","“‘He is judged and condemned,’ replied Pierre; ‘you must now help me carry him to the boat.’"
"“她不干。康伯勒迈就自己把他抬到船的底部，在他的脖子上绑了一块石头，拿着浆从海湾划到开阔的大海，最后来到他现在所处的这块岩石上。当这位可怜的母亲和她的小叔子哭喊着‘饶恕他吧！饶恕他吧！’赶到时，已经于事无补。空中明月高悬，她看着丈夫把儿子，她的儿子，她的骨肉投入水中。当时风平浪静，她听到了‘扑通’一声！之后便什么都没有了——没有声音也没有气泡。啊！大海会很好的守护自己所吞噬的东西。","“She refused; and Cambremer carried him alone; he laid him in the bottom of the boat, tied a stone to his neck, took the oars and rowed out of the cove to the open sea, till he came to the rock where he now is.When the poor mother, who had come up here with her brother-in-law, cried out, ‘Mercy, mercy!’ it was like throwing a stone at a wolf.There was a moon, and she saw the father casting her son into the water; her son, the child of her womb, and as there was no wind, she heard BLOUF! and then nothing—neither sound nor bubble.Ah! the sea is a fine keeper of what it gets."
"康伯勒迈划上岸，想阻止他妻子的哭叫，却发现她已经奄奄一息了。兄弟俩无法把她一路抬到家，不得不把她放到刚刚用来杀她儿子的那艘船上。他们绕过巴茨的塔，沿着克鲁瓦奇海道划着船回到了家。唉，唉！这位美丽的布鲁安，人们这么称呼她，没活过一周。她死前乞求丈夫烧掉那只可恨的船。哦，他这么做了。至于康伯勒迈，我也说不出来他成了什么。他就像一个不会喝酒的人喝醉了一样摇晃着。后来，他离开了，十天后再回来时他就呆在了你们看见他的那地方，从那以后他就再也没说过一句话。”","Rowing inshore to stop his wife’s cries, Cambremer found her half-dead.The two brothers couldn’t carry her the whole distance home, so they had to put her into the boat which had just served to kill her son, and they rowed back round the tower by the channel of Croisic.Well, well! the belle Brouin, as they called her, didn’t last a week.She died begging her husband to burn that accursed boat.Oh, he did it!As for him, he became I don’t know what; he staggered about like a man who can’t carry his wine.Then he went away and was gone ten days, and after he returned he put himself where you saw him, and since he has been there he has never said one word.”"
"渔夫很快就讲完了这个故事，比我写的要简单得多。穷苦人在讲述事情时很少作出评价。他们只说那些震撼过他们的事实，怎么感觉就怎么表达。这个故事让人的心痛得像是被斧子砍了一样。","The fisherman related this history rapidly and more simply than I can write it.The lower classes make few comments as they relate a thing; they tell the fact that strikes them, and present it as they felt it.This tale was made as sharply incisive as the blow of an axe."
"“我不去巴茨了。”我们来到湖岸上时，波利娜说。","“I shall not go to Batz,” said Pauline, when we came to the upper shore of the lake."
"我们返回克鲁瓦奇的路上有一片迷宫似的盐沼。渔夫带我们穿过这里，他现在也和我们一样一言不发。我们的心绪发生了变化。我们都陷入了忧郁的沉思中，这个让我们难过的惨剧解释了我们见到康伯勒迈时突然产生的那种不祥的预感。我们有足够的人生阅历去推测向导没有提到的关于这三个人的情节。这三个人的不幸遭遇显现在我们面前，就像我们曾在戏剧里看到过一样，这位父亲为他的罪行赎罪的行为是戏剧的高潮。我们不敢看向他坐着的那块岩石，那个不幸的人令整个村庄的人心生敬畏。几朵乌云遮蔽了天空，袅袅薄雾从天际线上腾起。我们穿过一片比我们以往见过的任何地方都要阴森、恐怖的地方，这里的环境看似虚弱不堪、饱尝苦痛，表层覆盖的盐碱可以被称作是大地的湿疹。这里，土地被划分成大小不等的正方形，或是被巨大的山脊圈着，或是被灰土的筑堤围着。方格里都盛满了水，盐就是从这里提炼出来的。人们把这些人力挖出的凹槽再用堤道划分开。制盐工人手执长耙，沿着这些堤道把盐拢到岸边。等到盐能堆放时，就把它们堆到平台上，每个盐堆的间隔一样大。","We returned to Croisic by the salt marshes, through the labyrinth of which we were guided by our fisherman, now as silent as ourselves.The inclination of our souls was changed.We were both plunged into gloomy reflections, saddened by the recital of a drama which explained the sudden presentiment which had seized us on seeing Cambremer.Each of us had enough knowledge of life to divine all that our guide had not told of that triple existence.The anguish of those three beings rose up before us as if we had seen it in a drama, culminating in that of the father expiating his crime.We dared not look at the rock where sat the fatal man who held the whole countryside in awe.A few clouds dimmed the skies; mists were creeping up from the horizon.We walked through a landscape more bitterly gloomy than any our eyes had ever rested on, a nature that seemed sickly, suffering, covered with salty crust, the eczema, it might be called, of earth.Here, the soil was mapped out in squares of unequal size and shape, all encased with enormous ridges or embankments of gray earth and filled with water, to the surface of which the salt scum rises.These gullies, made by the hand of man, are again divided by causeways, along which the laborers pass, armed with long rakes, with which they drag this scum to the bank, heaping it on platforms placed at equal distances when the salt is fit to handle."
"我们沿着这片让人抑郁的“棋盘”的边缘走了两个小时。这儿的盐抑制了各种植物的生长，除了几个“盐工”（这是制盐工人在当地的称呼），也很少有人来这儿。这些人，或者更确切地说是这些布列塔尼宗族的人，穿着一种特殊的服装：一件白色短上衣，很像酿酒工的着装。他们在本宗族内相互通婚。这个宗族的女子还没有谁嫁给了不是盐工的人。","For two hours we skirted the edge of this melancholy checkerboard, where salt has stifled all forms of vegetation, and where no one ever comes but a few “paludiers,” the local name given to the laborers of the salt marshes.These men, or rather this clan of Bretons, wear a special costume: a white jacket, something like that of brewers.They marry among themselves.There is no instance of a girl of the tribe having ever married any man who was not a paludier."
"沼泽地里最恐怖的莫过于泥坑了。而泥坑上的泥浆都用耙子有条不紊地耙过。布列塔尼的各种植物都很惧怕这里的灰土。而这里阴暗的灰土和布满我们心灵的悲凉是多么吻合啊！我们穿过海湾来到一个新地方。毫无疑问，海湾是用来补充盐池中静止的盐水的。让我们欣慰的是沙滩上长了微小的、发了芽的植物。我们穿越海湾时，看到了康伯勒迈居住过的那个岛屿，可是我们转过了脸。","The horrible aspects of these marshes, these sloughs, the mud of which was systematically raked, the dull gray earth that the Breton flora held in horror, were in keeping with the gloom that filled our souls.When we reached a spot where we crossed an arm of the sea, which no doubt serves to feed the stagnant salt-pools, we noticed with relief the puny vegetation which sprouted through the sand of the beach.As we crossed, we saw the island on which the Cambremers had lived; but we turned away our heads."
"回到旅馆时，我们注意到了一张台球桌。当了解到这是克鲁瓦奇镇唯一一张台球桌时，我们马上收拾，准备连夜离开。第二天，我们到了盖朗德。波利娜还是很伤心，而我感到脑中重现的狂热即将毁掉我。那三个人的形象在我脑中浮现，残酷地折磨着我。最后波利娜说：","Arriving at the hotel, we noticed a billiard-table, and finding that it was the only billiard-table in Croisic, we made our preparations to leave during the night.The next day we went to Guerande.Pauline was still sad, and I myself felt a return of that fever of the brain which will destroy me.I was so cruelly tortured by the visions that came to me of those three lives, that Pauline said at last,—"
"“路易，把这件事记录下来，这会纾解你心中的狂热。”","“Louis, write it all down; that will change the nature of the fever within you.”"
"因此，我写下了这篇记叙文给您，亲爱的叔叔。但是件事对我的冲击已经使我失去了平静，我失去了从海浴中和在此处逗留中获得的那份平静。","So I have written you this narrative, dear uncle; but the shock of such an event has made me lose the calmness I was beginning to gain from sea-bathing and our stay in this place."
