"新天方夜谭","A Night in New Arabia"
"作者：欧·亨利","by O. Henry"
"地铁上的巴格达是个到处都有哈里发的城市。这里的宫殿、集市、客栈和偏僻小道都挤满了各种乔装打扮的哈希德，他们毫无节制地行善，从中寻找消遣和作弄的对象。很少能有贫穷的乞丐不受他们的羞辱就能得到他们的救济，很少能有穷困潦倒的人在得到好处后不再遭遇新的不幸。你会发现，食不果腹的人也会在他们捐助的图书馆里勒紧腰带，清贫的学者过节时也会红着脸接受慈善机构大吹大擂送上门的有着芹菜型鸡冠的火鸡。","The great city of Bagdad-on-the-Subway is caliph-ridden.Its palaces, bazaars, khans, and byways are thronged with Al Rashids in divers disguises, seeking diversion and victims for their unbridled generosity.You can scarcely find a poor beggar whom they are willing to let enjoy his spoils unsuccored, nor a wrecked unfortunate upon whom they will not reshower the means of fresh misfortune.You will hardly find anywhere a hungry one who has not had the opportunity to tighten his belt in gift libraries, nor a poor pundit who has not blushed at the holiday basket of celery-crowned turkey forced resoundingly through his door by the eleemosynary press."
"所以，独眼托钵僧、小驼背和理发匠的六弟穿过哈伦经常出没的街道时，总是提心吊胆，希望能逃脱那群徘徊着的哈里发苏丹的救济。","So then, fearfully through the Harun-haunted streets creep the one-eyed calenders, the Little Hunchback and the Barber’s Sixth Brother, hoping to escape the ministrations of the roving horde of caliphoid sultans."
"许多阿拉伯夜晚的娱乐是听那些逃离了忠诚臣民之王的慷慨施舍的人讲有趣的故事。你可以坐在魔毯上听那些故事直到天亮：大魔王洛克菲勒派四十大盗把阿里巴巴的炼油厂榨干了；善良的哈里发卡内捐赠了宫殿；罪人赛巴德七次乘木制旅游船在众岛屿中游览；渔夫与瓶子；巴米赛德斯的寄宿处；阿拉丁靠神奇的煤气表发了大财。","Entertainment for many Arabian nights might be had from the histories of those who have escaped the largesse of the army of Commanders of the Faithful.Until dawn you might sit on the enchanted rug and listen to such stories as are told of the powerful genie Roc-Ef-El-Er who sent the Forty Thieves to soak up the oil plant of Ali Baba; of the good Caliph Kar-Neg-Ghe, who gave away palaces; of the Seven Voyages of Sailbad, the Sinner, who frequented wooden excursion steamers among the islands; of the Fisherman and the Bottle; of the Barmecides’ Boarding house; of Aladdin’s rise to wealth by means of his Wonderful Gas-meter."
"但是现在，苏丹比山鲁佐德多多了，她身价倍增，根本不用担心被绞死。因此，讲故事的本领每况愈下。当越来越少的哈里发到处寻找快乐的穷人和认命的倒霉蛋，以便把奇怪的恩惠和神秘的好处强加给他们，以至总部不时发来报告说那些俘虏拒绝“招供”。","But now, there being ten sultans to one Sheherazade, she is held too valuable to be in fear of the bowstring.In consequence the art of narrative languishes.And, as the lesser caliphs are hunting the happy poor and the resigned unfortunate from cover to cover in order to heap upon them strange mercies and mysterious benefits, too often comes the report from Arabian headquarters that the captive refused “to talk.”"
"这之后，在他们那善心毁灭的世界里出演悲喜剧的演员们沉默了。这沉默，在某种程度上，说明了这个费心收集的故事的缺点。这个故事应该叫做：","This reticence, then, in the actors who perform the sad comedies of their philanthropy-scourged world, must, in a degree, account for the shortcomings of this painfully gleaned tale, which shall be called "
"《哈里发赎罪的故事》","The story of the caliph weho alleviated his conscience "
"老雅各布·斯普拉金斯在他那价值一千两百美元的橡木餐柜前给自己调了杯加苏打的锂盐矿泉水。喝下去想必就有了灵感，因为他立刻有力地用拳头在橡木柜上敲打了一下，对着空荡荡的餐厅喊：","Old Jacob Spraggins mixed for himself some Scotch and loria water at his $1,200 oak sideboard.Inspiration must have resulted from its imbibition, for immediately afterward he struck the quartered oak soundly with his fist and shouted to the empty dining room: "
"“我对地狱里的炼焦炉发誓，肯定是那一万美元！要是能把这件事解决，我的心结也就解开了。”","“By the coke ovens of hell, it must be that ten thousand dollars!If I can get that squared, it’ll do the trick.”"
"这样，既然已经用最常见的手法吊足了你的胃口，不如再卖个关子，让你心情不快地看个十五年前的无聊的传记吧。","Thus, by the commonest artifice of the trade, having gained your interest, the action of the story will now be suspended, leaving you grumpily to consider a sort of dull biography beginning fifteen years before."
"当老雅各布还是小雅各布的时候，他是宾夕法尼亚一个煤矿里管碎石机的小厮。我不知道碎石机小厮是干嘛的，但是他的工作好像是带着饭盒，病怏怏地站在煤矿前让人拍了照片登到杂志上去。不管怎样，雅各布就干这个。但是，他并没在九岁时死于积劳，留下他手无缚鸡之力的父母和靠着罢工联盟救济的兄弟们。相反他提提吊带，不时攒上一两美元，到四十五岁时已经身价两千万美元了。","When old Jacob was young Jacob he was a breaker boy in a Pennsylvania coal mine.I don’t know what a breaker boy is; but his occupation seems to be standing by a coal dump with a wan look and a dinner-pail to have his picture taken for magazine articles.Anyhow, Jacob was one.But, instead of dying of overwork at nine, and leaving his helpless parents and brothers at the mercy of the union strikers’ reserve fund, he hitched up his galluses, put a dollar or two in a side proposition now and then, and at forty-five was worth $20,000,000."
"就这样！完啦！连打哈欠的时间都没有，对吧？我以前也读过传记——但我们还是当作不知道吧。","There now! it’s over.Hardly had time to yawn, did you?I’ve seen biographies that—but let us dissemble."
"我希望你们注意已经经历了人生七个阶段的雅各布·斯普拉金斯先生。这些阶段分别是：第一，白手起家；第二，适当提升；第三，成为股东；第四，资本形成；第五，蜕变为托拉斯；第六，为富不仁；第七，成为哈里发；第八，未知。第八阶段要高等数学才能算出结果。","I want you to consider Jacob Spraggins, Esq., after he had arrived at the seventh stage of his career.The stages meant are, first, humble origin; second, deserved promotion; third, stockholder; fourth, capitalist; fifth, trust magnate; sixth, rich malefactor; seventh, caliph; eighth, x.The eighth stage shall be left to the higher mathematics."
"五十五岁时，雅各布不再活跃于商界，退休了。他的收入依旧来自他所独裁的煤矿、地产、石油、铁路、工厂和公司，可是没有一样钱是以它本来面目进入他手中的。这些是消毒过的盈余，经过精心洗白、熏蒸、渲染，最后到他私人秘书白皙的手里时，已经成为没有任何污点的支票。雅各布在新巴格达城面对富翁街拐角的一块地皮上，造了一座价值三百万美元的宫殿，开始觉得已故的哈伦拉希德的斗篷落到了他的肩上。最终他穿上斗篷，在领口那打了一个精致的活结，成为了一个获得许可去压榨我们美索不达米亚无产阶级的掠夺者。","At fifty-five Jacob retired from active business.The income of a czar was still rolling in on him from coal, iron, real estate, oil, railroads, manufactories, and corporations, but none of it touched Jacob’s hands in a raw state.It was a sterilized increment, carefully cleaned and dusted and fumigated until it arrived at its ultimate stage of untainted, spotless checks in the white fingers of his private secretary.Jacob built a three-million-dollar palace on a corner lot fronting on Nabob Avenue, city of New Bagdad, and began to feel the mantle of the late H. A. Rashid descending upon him.Eventually Jacob slipped the mantle under his collar, tied it in a neat four-in-hand, and became a licensed harrier of our Mesopotamian proletariat."
"当一个人的收入变得非常丰厚，以至于肉铺送来的确实就是他点的那种牛排时，他开始琢磨灵魂的救赎了。现在，我们一定不能忘记富人的不同阶段或阶级。资本家会一美元不差地告诉你他的资产数目。而托拉斯会估价一下数目。家财万贯的坏人会递给你一支雪茄，并否认他已经买下了一条铁路。哈里发仅仅微笑着，谈论哈默斯坦和搞音乐的女孩儿。在一家宴请周到的旅馆里，一个托拉斯和他的妻子吃早饭时发生了激烈的争执，起因是妻子将她和她未来前夫的资产高估了三百万美元。哦，对了，我曾听过一个类似的夫妻争执。起因是那个男人发现口袋里的钱比他记得的少了五十五美分。我们所有人，终究都是俗人——托尔斯泰伯爵、罗菲茨西蒙斯、彼得·潘，和我们一样，都是如此。","When a man’s income becomes so large that the butcher actually sends him the kind of steak he orders, he begins to think about his soul’s salvation.Now, the various stages or classes of rich men must not be forgotten.The capitalist can tell you to a dollar the amount of his wealth.The trust magnate “estimates” it.The rich malefactor hands you a cigar and denies that he has bought the P. D. & Q.The caliph merely smiles and talks about Hammerstein and the musical lasses.There is a record of tremendous altercation at breakfast in a “Where-to-Dine-Well” tavern between a magnate and his wife, the rift within the loot being that the wife calculated their fortune at a figure $3,000,000 higher than did her future divorcé.Oh, well, I, myself, heard a similar quarrel between a man and his wife because he found fifty cents less in his pockets than he thought he had.After all, we are all human—Count Tolstoi, R. Fitzsimmons, Peter Pan, and the rest of us."
"在智慧的读者看来，这故事要变成某种道德评说类型的文章了，但别失去耐心啊。","Don’t lose heart because the story seems to be degenerating into a sort of moral essay for intellectual readers."
"对白和表演马上就出场了。","There will be dialogue and stage business pretty soon."
"当雅各布开始把针眼和动物园的骆驼进行比较时，他决定建立一个慈善组织。他让秘书寄了一张一百万美金的支票给寰球慈善协会。你也许会透过一个破旧仓库前的窨井盖向下看，寻找你掉下去的镍币。但那是题外话。这个协会告知他们已经收到他上个月二十四日寄来的信件和随信附上的票据。雅各布·斯普拉金斯先生读到了那条“有位雅思布·斯帕金尤斯向寰球慈善协会捐赠一百万”的消息，在晚报上，这条消息尽管被两条线分开，但还是和标题为“今日怪闻”的那一栏离得很近。骆驼的胃能满足一个礼拜里的每天所需；但我不敢贸然说它有胡子，以免引起华盛顿的不快；如果它有胡子的话，那肯定也没有富人曾用它的胡子穿针眼，借以进入天国。这个权利受到保护不得侵犯，天国看门人兼秘书彼得签署。","When Jacob first began to compare the eyes of needles with the camels in the Zoo he decided upon organized charity.He had his secretary send a check for one million to the Universal Benevolent Association of the Globe.You may have looked down through a grating in front of a decayed warehouse for a nickel that you had dropped through.But that is neither here nor there.The Association acknowledged receipt of his favor of the 24th ult. With enclosure as stated.Separated by a double line, but still mighty close to the matter under the caption of “Oddities of the Day’s News” in an evening paper, Jacob Spraggins read that one “Jasper Spargyous” had “donated $100,000 to the U. B. A. of G.”A camel may have a stomach for each day in the week; but I dare not venture to accord him whiskers, for fear of the Great Displeasure at Washington; but if he have whiskers, surely not one of them will seem to have been inserted in the eye of a needle by that effort of that rich man to enter the K. of H.The right is reserved to reject any and all bids; signed, S. Peter, secretary and gatekeeper."
"接着雅各布挑选了一个他所能找到的最适合捐赠的大学，向它捐赠了二十万美金用于建一个实验室。这个学校原本没有开设科学课程，但还是接受捐款，建造了一个精致的厕所，而雅各布也没发现这超出了专款专用的范围。","Next, Jacob selected the best endowed college he could scare up and presented it with a $200,000 laboratory.The college did not maintain a scientific course, but it accepted the money and built an elaborate lavatory instead, which was no diversion of funds so far as Jacob ever discovered."
"教职工开会邀请雅各布来领一个初学学位。在寄送请帖前，他们笑了，把“初”改成“文”，于是皆大欢喜了。","The faculty met and invited Jacob to come over and take his A B C degree.Before sending the invitation they smiled, cut out the C, added the proper punctuation marks, and all was well."
"在举行授予仪式之前，雅各布在校园里漫步,看到两个教授在附近散步。他们的声音，由于长期适应室内的音响效果，很是响亮，不经意间传到了他的耳朵里。","While walking on the campus before being capped and gowned, Jacob saw two professors strolling nearby.Their voices, long adapted to indoor acoustics, undesignedly reached his ear."
"“那就是那个新近的骗子，”他们其中一个说，“从我们这儿买了一剂安眠药。他明天就能拿到学位了。”","“There goes the latest chevalier d’industrie,” said one of them, “to buy a sleeping powder from us.He gets his degree to-morrow.”"
"“发自内心的，”另外一个说，“去他妈的。”","“In foro conscientiæ,” said the other.“Let’s ’eave ’arf a brick at ’im.”"
"雅各布不懂拉丁语，但那侮辱的取笑对他来说还不难理解。他买的那个荣誉里可没有掺着曼德拉草。那会儿《纯食品与药品法案》还没有通过。","Jacob ignored the Latin, but the brick pleasantry was not too hard for him.There was no mandragora in the honorary draught of learning that he had bought.That was before the passage of the Pure Food and Drugs Act."
"雅各布对大规模的慈善产生了厌烦情绪。","Jacob wearied of philanthropy on a large scale."
"“如果我能看到人们很欢乐”，他对自己说，“假如我能亲眼看到并且亲耳听到他们对我为他们所做的一切表示感谢，那会让我好受些。这样把钱捐给机构和团体就好像把钱投进坏掉的吃角子老虎机一样。”","“If I could see folks made happier,” he said to himself—“If I could see ’em myself and hear ’em express their gratitude for what I done for ’em it would make me feel better.This donatin’ funds to institutions and societies is about as satisfactory as dropping money into a broken slot machine.”"
"所以，雅各布凭本能行事，走过肮脏的街道，来到了最贫穷的家庭。","So Jacob followed his nose, which led him through unswept streets to the homes of the poorest."
"“大消息！”雅各布说，“我要包下两条蒸汽船，船上要装满不幸的孩子，还要装——比如说一万只洋娃娃玩具啦，一千桶冰激凌啦，要让他们去松得海峡开心地玩一次。这次旅行的海风应该会吹走这些钱的异味，它争先恐后涌进我的脑子里，害的我不得安宁的。”","“The very thing!” said Jacob.“I will charter two river steamboats, pack them full of these unfortunate children and—say ten thousand dolls and drums and a thousand freezers of ice cream, and give them a delightful outing up the Sound.The sea breezes on that trip ought to blow the taint off some of this money that keeps coming in faster than I can work it off my mind.”"
"雅各布定是泄露了他的慈善意图，因为一个身材健硕、油头光面、嘴上仿佛挂着“请在此投信”的牌子的人，一把揪住了他，把他推到理发师招牌杆和一堆布满灰尘的罐子中间。话从那投递口出来——声音柔和沙哑，言辞温和巧妙，却又好像随时会翻脸不认人。","Jacob must have leaked some of his benevolent intentions, for an immense person with a bald face and a mouth that looked as if it ought to have a “Drop Letters Here” sign over it hooked a finger around him and set him in a space between a barber’s pole and a stack of ash cans.Words came out of the post-office slit—smooth, husky words with gloves on ’em, but sounding as if they might turn to bare knuckles any moment."
"“喂，小子，知道你在哪儿么？嘿，你闯的这是迈克尔·奥格雷迪的地儿——知道不？只有迈克尔才有权力让这儿的孩子闹肚子疼——听过没？这儿要是举行野餐、发放小红气球之类的，也得是迈克尔付钱——懂吗？你要是插手，准有人揍你。你们这些决策人、改革家、社会学家、百万富翁已经把这儿搞得一团糟。你们的大学生和教授挤满了卖苏打水的小店，游览车又占满了街道，这儿的人都吓得不敢出门了。现在，你把他们交给迈克尔吧。他们是他的人，他晓得怎么搞定他们。你别给我滚到这地儿来。大叔，你现在是不是搞明白了点儿，还要不要跟迈克尔·奥格雷迪在这儿抢着当圣诞老人？”","“Say, Sport, do you know where you are at?Well, dis is Mike O’Grady’s district you’re buttin’ into—see?Mike’s got de stomach-ache privilege for every kid in dis neighborhood—see?And if dere’s any picnics or red balloons to be dealt out here, Mike’s money pays for ’em—see?Don’t you butt in, or something’ll be handed to you.Youse d—settlers and reformers with your social ologies and your millionaire detectives have got dis district in a hell of a fix, anyhow.With your college students and professors rough-housing de soda-water stands and dem rubber-neck coaches fillin’ de streets, de folks down here are ‘fraid to go out of de houses.Now, you leave ’em to Mike.Dey belongs to him, and he knows how to handle ’em.Keep on your own side of de town.Are you some wiser now, uncle, or do you want to scrap wit’ Mike O’Grady for de Santa Claus belt in dis district?”"
"显然，已经有人捷足先登了这块道德葡萄园。就此，斯普拉金斯哈里发在东区集市已经不再有威慑力了。为了控制他不断增长的收益，他双倍捐赠了一个慈善组织，又给他家乡的基督教青年会送了一套价值一万美金的蝴蝶标本集，还给遭遇饥荒的中国人寄了一张支票，金额足够用来买一尊全新的有着墨绿色瞳孔和镶钻牙齿的佛陀来祭拜。但这些慈善行为并没有让哈里发的心平静下来。他试图给门童和服务生十美元和二十美元的小费，来给他的乐善好施增添一点个人光彩。这些奴才们拿到与他们提供的服务相称的钱时表现得相当有敬意，却在背地里好好嘲弄了他一番。他找到了一个有野心、有才能，却很穷的姑娘，出钱让她在一部新拍的喜剧里出演主角。要不是他忘记了给她写信，他或许在这一慈善事业理还要多花五万美元的累赘钱。她因为证据不足输掉了官司，尽管如此，他的资产依旧日益增长，他的骆驼穿针眼——或者说富人病——还是没减轻。","Clearly, that spot in the moral vineyard was preempted.So Caliph Spraggins menaced no more the people in the bazaars of the East Side.To keep down his growing surplus he doubled his donations to organized charity, presented the Y. M. C. A. of his native town with a $10,000 collection of butterflies, and sent a check to the famine sufferers in China big enough to buy new emerald eyes and diamond-filled teeth for all their gods.But none of these charitable acts seemed to bring peace to the caliph’s heart.He tried to get a personal note into his benefactions by tipping bellboys and waiters $10 and $20 bills.He got well snickered at and derided for that by the minions who accept with respect gratuities commensurate to the service performed.He sought out an ambitious and talented but poor young woman, and bought for her the star part in a new comedy.He might have gotten rid of $50,000 more of his cumbersome money in this philanthropy if he had not neglected to write letters to her.But she lost the suit for lack of evidence, while his capital still kept piling up, and his optikos needleorum camelibus—or rich man’s disease—was unrelieved."
"在斯普拉金斯哈里发价值三百万的豪宅里住他的姐姐亨利埃塔，她曾经在焦炭镇的餐馆里给煤矿工人烧每份二十五美分的饭，而如今她跟约翰·米切尔握手也只用两根手指。他的女儿西莉亚，十九岁，刚从一个私人导师教授的餐厅言语和礼仪之类的住宿学校回来。","In Caliph Spraggins’s $3,000,000 home lived his sister Henrietta, who used to cook for the coal miners in a twenty-five-cent eating house in Coketown, Pa., and who now would have offered John Mitchell only two fingers of her hand to shake.And his daughter Celia, nineteen, back from boarding-school and from being polished off by private instructors in the restaurant languages and those loria and things."
"西莉亚是这个故事的女主角。我担心艺术家在这页上对她气质的描述很可能会让你有错觉，还是让我来给你描述吧。她是个美丽的女孩儿，有点儿笨拙，大大咧咧中还带点儿害羞，有着棕色的头发、白皙的面容、明亮的眼睛，脸上总挂着笑容。她继承了斯普拉金斯的一切，吃粗茶淡饭，穿宽松的衣服，还喜欢和下人打交道。她精力旺盛，以至于难以感受财富的压力。她大嘴巴里常常咀嚼着薄荷味的胃消化酶片，好像老虎机吃钱的声音；她还会吹口哨，吹得像号角一样响亮。记住这画面就好，让拙劣的艺术家去描绘吧。","Celia is the heroine.Lest the artist’s delineation of her charms on this very page humbug your fancy, take from me her authorized description.She was a nice-looking, awkward, loud, rather bashful, brown-haired girl, with a sallow complexion, bright eyes, and a perpetual smile.She had a wholesome, Spraggins-inherited love for plain food, loose clothing, and the society of the lower classes.She had too much health and youth to feel the burden of wealth.She had a wide mouth that kept the peppermint-pepsin tablets rattling like hail from the slot-machine wherever she went, and she could whistle hornpipes.Keep this picture in mind; and let the artist do his worst."
"一天，西莉亚向窗外张望，看上了杂货店的小伙子。那小伙子根本没注意到，因为他那时只忙着咒他那匹年老的马，命贱还未决。当你从马车上拿下一篓新鲜鸡蛋的时候，马应该站着不动的。","Celia looked out of her window one day and gave her heart to the grocer’s young man.The receiver thereof was at that moment engaged in conceding immortality to his horse and calling down upon him the ultimate fate of the wicked; so he did not notice the transfer.A horse should stand still when you are lifting a crate of strictly new-laid eggs out of the wagon."
"年轻的读者小姐，你也有可能喜欢那个杂货店的小伙子。但你肯定不会把芳心暗许在他身上，因为你想把心留给马术教练，或是忧郁的鞋厂老板，或者是在棕榈湾沙滩上遇到的穿灰色花呢衣的男人。呵，我知道那些。所以我很庆幸喜欢杂货店小子的女孩儿是西莉亚，不是你。","Young lady reader, you would have liked that grocer’s young man yourself.But you wouldn’t have given him your heart, because you are saving it for a riding-master, or a shoe-manufacturer with a torpid liver, or something quiet but rich in gray tweeds at Palm Beach.Oh, I know about it.So I am glad the grocer’s young man was for Celia, and not for you."
"杂货店小伙子消瘦挺拔，和杂志封底上穿着新式滑轮背带裤的帅哥一样，自信又亲切。他将花呢单车帽反戴在头上，露在外面的头发是稻草色卷发，不向货车马儿宣讲令人厌烦的惩罚讲义时，他那晒得嘿嘿的脸上总挂着笑容。他拿着上好的进口杂货，仿佛它们只是他要送到寄宿公寓的东西；当他拿起他的鞭子，你会立刻想到塔克特先生和他击剑的气场。","The grocer’s young man was slim and straight and as confident and easy in his movements as the man in the back of the magazines who wears the new frictionless roller suspenders.He wore a gray bicycle cap on the back of his head, and his hair was straw-colored and curly, and his sunburned face looked like one that smiled a good deal when he was not preaching the doctrine of everlasting punishment to delivery-wagon horses.He slung imported A1 fancy groceries about as though they were only the stuff he delivered at boarding-houses; and when he picked up his whip, your mind instantly recalled Mr. Tackett and his air with the buttonless foils."
"零售商从货时从房子后面的一个边门进出。送货的马车大约早上十点来。三天来，西莉亚一直等着他，看他抛掷精选的水果、谷物和罐头时那高傲又满不在乎的样子，每回都能发现一些让她爱慕的新地方。于是她就向安妮特请教了。","Tradesmen delivered their goods at a side gate at the rear of the house.The grocer’s wagon came about ten in the morning.For three days Celia watched the driver when he came, finding something new each time to admire in the lofty and almost contemptuous way he had of tossing around the choicest gifts of Pomona, Ceres, and the canning factories.Then she consulted Annette."
"要说明的是，安妮特·麦克科尔，是位值得用一段文字来介绍的女佣。安妮特细细品读了大量从公共免费图书馆里借来的爱情小说（是由一位商界最大的哈里发捐赠的）。她是西莉亚的闺蜜兼好友，你放心，亨利埃塔姑妈不知道这件事。","To be explicit, Annette McCorkle, the second housemaid who deserves a paragraph herself.Annette Fletcherized large numbers of romantic novels which she obtained at a free public library branch (donated by one of the biggest caliphs in the business).She was Celia’s side-kicker and chum, though Aunt Henrietta didn’t know it, you may hazard a bean or two."
"“哦，我的小姐啊！”安妮特说，“这事儿太有趣了。你一个富家小姐，居然对他一见钟情！他是个讨人喜欢的小伙子，超过同行的其他人。但他不像别的杂货小子那样。他从来不关注我。”","“Oh, canary-bird seed!” exclaimed Annette.“Ain’t it a corkin’ situation?You a heiress, and fallin’ in love with him on sight!He’s a sweet boy, too, and above his business.But he ain’t susceptible like the common run of grocer’s assistants.He never pays no attention to me.”"
"“他会关注我的。”西莉亚说。","“He will to me,” said Celia."
"“富有——”安妮特那犀利的女性之剑已经出鞘，说的不无道理。","“Riches—” began Annette, unsheathing the not unjustifiable feminine sting."
"“喂，那是因为你不太漂亮，”西莉亚带着平和宽慰的笑容说道，“我也不漂亮。不过我要让他知道钱和相貌根本没关系。那才公平。现在呢，安妮特，我想借你的帽子和围裙一用。”","“Oh, you’re not so beautiful,” said Celia, with her wide, disarming smile.“Neither am I; but he sha’n’t know that there’s any money mixed up with my looks, such as they are.That’s fair.Now, I want you to lend me one of your caps and an apron, Annette.”"
"“哦，我的小宝贝儿！”安妮特嚷道，“我明白了。太有趣了！简直就像‘左撇子勒尔兰’，或是‘纽扣惹的祸’一样。我打赌他指不定还是个伯爵呢。”","“Oh, marshmallows!” cried Annette.“I see.Ain’t it lovely?It’s just like ‘Lurline, the Left-Handed; or, A Buttonhole Maker’s Wrongs.’I’ll bet he’ll turn out to be a count.”"
"房子后边有条格子栏杆的走道（或者叫“走廊”，那头的人都这么叫）。杂货小伙子穿过这条路送货。有天早上，他经过那儿的时候碰到有个带着女佣帽子绑着围裙的年轻姑娘，她有清澈的眼眸、白皙的脸、大大的嘴边带着平和的笑容。当时他拿着一篮子新鲜的莴苣和特级番茄、三捆芦笋和六瓶最昂贵的橄榄，所以没有在意她，只当她是众多女佣中的一个而已。","There was a long hallway (or “passageway,” as they call it in the land of the Colonels) with one side latticed, running along the rear of the house.The grocer’s young man went through this to deliver his goods.One morning he passed a girl in there with shining eyes, sallow complexion, and wide, smiling mouth, wearing a maid’s cap and apron.But as he was cumbered with a basket of Early Drumhead lettuce and Trophy tomatoes and three bunches of asparagus and six bottles of the most expensive Queen olives, he saw no more than that she was one of the maids."
"但他回来的时候，他走在她身后，听到她正在吹《渔夫的号角》，吹得又响又清亮，世上所有的高音笛都黯然失色，应该赶快拆了躲进笛盒里，以免丢人。","But on his way out he came up behind her, and she was whistling “Fisher’s Hornpipe” so loudly and clearly that all the piccolos in the world should have disjointed themselves and crept into their cases for shame."
"杂货店小伙子停了下来，把帽子向后推去，挂到领子后的纽扣上去。","The grocer’s young man stopped and pushed back his cap until it hung on his collar button behind."
"“真厉害啊。”他说。","“That’s out o’ sight, Kid,” said he."
"“我叫西莉亚，可以告诉我你的名字吗？”女孩儿笑得更深了些，在他看来甚是夺目。","“My name is Celia, if you please,” said the whistler, dazzling him with a three-inch smile."
"“好的。我叫托马斯·麦克利奥德。你在公馆的哪个地方干活儿呢？”","That’s all right.I’m Thomas McLeod.What part of the house do you work in?”"
"“我——我是在客厅里的女佣。”","“I’m the—the second parlor maid.”"
"“那你认识‘瀑布’吗？”","“Do you know the ‘Falling Waters’?”"
"“不认识，”西莉亚说，“我们谁都不认识。主要是我们发家发得太快了——啊，我是说，斯普拉金斯家。”","“No,” said Celia, “we don’t know anybody.We got rich too quick—that is, Mr. Spraggins did.”"
"“我会给你介绍一下的，”托马斯·麦克利奥德说，“斯特拉斯佩舞曲——角笛曲的表兄。”","“I’ll make you acquainted,” said Thomas McLeod.“It’s a strathspey—the first cousin to a hornpipe.”"
"如果说西莉亚让高音笛黯然失色，那托马斯·麦克利奥德的口哨声真是让最厉害的长笛无地自容。他真的能吹出低音。","If Celia’s whistling put the piccolos out of commission, Thomas McLeod’s surely made the biggest flutes hunt their holes.He could actually whistle bass."
"当他吹完的时候，西莉亚都想要跳上他的送货马车，跟着他坐到码头，搭上去冥河线的船了。","When he stopped Celia was ready to jump into his delivery wagon and ride with him clear to the end of the pier and on to the ferry-boat of the Charon line."
"明儿早上十点十五分我会来，”托马斯说，“来送箱汽水和一点儿菠菜。”","“I’ll be around to-morrow at 10:15,” said Thomas, “with some spinach and a case of carbonic.”"
"“我会好好练习你说的那个曲子的，”西莉亚说，“我二声部吹得还不错。”","“I’ll practice that what-you-may-call-it,” said Celia.“I can whistle a fine second.”"
"追求的过程是个人隐私，不属于一般文学讨论的范畴。那些只在含铁的补品广告和《猎艳宝典》上才会有具体描述。优雅的文字描绘只可包含过程的某些阶段，浅尝辄止，不会侵入Ｘ射线或公园巡警的领域。","The processes of courtship are personal, and do not belong to general literature.They should be chronicled in detail only in advertisements of iron tonics and in the secret by-laws of the Woman’s Auxiliary of the Ancient Order of the Rat Trap.But genteel writing may contain a description of certain stages of its progress without intruding upon the province of the X-ray or of park policemen."
"一天，托马斯·麦克利奥德与西莉亚在走廊的尽头那里逗留。","A day came when Thomas McLeod and Celia lingered at the end of the latticed “passage.”"
"“一礼拜十六美元不太多。”托马斯说，把帽子搭在了肩膀上。","“Sixteen a week isn’t much,” said Thomas, letting his cap rest on his shoulder blades."
"西莉亚看看栏杆外边，吹着一首哭丧调子。前一天跟亨利埃塔姑妈出去逛街，买了一打手帕就花了那么多。","Celia looked through the lattice-work and whistled a dead march.Shopping with Aunt Henrietta the day before, she had paid that much for a dozen handkerchiefs."
"“可能下个月我就涨工钱了，”托马斯说，“我明天还是这个时候过来送袋面粉和洗衣皂。”","“Maybe I’ll get a raise next month,” said Thomas.“I’ll be around to-morrow at the same time with a bag of flour and the laundry soap.”"
"“好，”西莉亚说，“安妮特有个结了婚的表姐，在布朗克斯租了间房，每个月只要二十美元就够了。”","“All right,” said Celia.“Annette’s married cousin pays only $20 a month for a flat in the Bronx.”"
"她从来没有指望过斯普拉金斯的钱。她知道亨利埃塔姑妈对社会地位的自豪感和父亲对财富权利的控制，而且她知道，如果她选择和托马斯在一起，他们只好靠吹口哨来度日了。","Never for a moment did she count on the Spraggins money.She knew Aunt Henrietta’s invincible pride of caste and pa’s mightiness as a Colossus of cash, and she understood that if she chose Thomas she and her grocer’s young man might go whistle for a living."
"另一天，托马斯完全不把富翁街尊严放在眼里，尖利地吹着《魔鬼梦》。","Another day came, Thomas violating the dignity of Nabob Avenue with “The Devil’s Dream,” whistled keenly between his teeth."
"“昨儿个我的工资已经涨到每礼拜十八美元了。”他说道，“我去晨曦街看过房子了。你可以准备解下围裙摘掉帽子啦，大姐。”","“Raised to eighteen a week yesterday,” he said.“Been pricing flats around Morningside.You want to start untying those apron strings and unpinning that cap, old girl.”"
"“哦，汤米！”西莉亚脸上挂着大大的笑容说道，“难道那还不够令人满足吗？我要去让贝蒂教我怎么做乡村布丁。如果我们愿意，我想我们可以管它叫公寓布丁。”","“Oh, Tommy!” said Celia, with her broadest smile.“Won’t that be enough?I got Betty to show me how to make a cottage pudding.I guess we could call it a flat pudding if we wanted to.”"
"“那就这么说定了啊。”托马斯说。","“And tell no lie,” said Thomas."
"“而且我会扫地、打蜡、除尘——当然啦，每个女佣都会做。我们还能在晚上来个口哨二重奏。”","“And I can sweep and polish and dust—of course, a parlor maid learns that.And we could whistle duets of evenings.”"
"“老头说到圣诞节的时候我就可以涨到二十美元了，如果布莱恩想不出比‘拖欠鬼’更坏的词来形容共和党的人的话。”杂货小子说道。","“The old man said he’d raise me to twenty at Christmas if Bryan couldn’t think of any harder name to call a Republican than a ‘postponer,’” said the grocer’s young man."
"“我会缝纫，”西莉亚说，“而且我知道煤气公司的人查表要先看他的证件，还知道怎么开柑橘罐头，怎么装窗帘。”","“I can sew,” said Celia; “and I know that you must make the gas company’s man show his badge when he comes to look at the meter; and I know how to put up quince jam and window curtains.”"
"“呀！西莉亚，你好厉害。我想我们一礼拜十八美元也能过日子了。”","“Bully! You’re all right, Cele.Yes, I believe we can pull it off on eighteen.”"
"当杂货小子跳上马车的时候，客厅女佣冒着被发现的危险，飞快地跑到门口。","As he was jumping into the wagon the second parlor maid braved discovery by running swiftly to the gate."
"“啊，对了，汤米，我忘了，”她温柔地说，“我还可以给你打领带。”","“And, oh, Tommy, I forgot,” she called, softly.“I believe I could make your neckties.”"
"“这不要紧。”托马斯果断地回答道。","“Forget it,” said Thomas decisively."
"“还有，”她继续说道，“晚上放黄瓜片可以驱赶蟑螂。”","“And another thing,” she continued.“Sliced cucumbers at night will drive away cockroaches.”"
"“还可以驱赶睡意呢。”麦克利奥德先生说道，“这样，如果我今天下午在西街有货要送的话，就顺便去那边的家具店看看。”","“And sleep, too, you bet,” said Mr. McLeod.“Yes, I believe if I have a delivery to make on the West Side this afternoon I’ll look in at a furniture store I know over there.”"
"马车离开的时候，老雅各布·斯普拉金斯用拳头给餐桌柜来了一击，你大概还记得关于那一万美元，他没头没脑地说了一些话。这证明了有些故事、生活，以及掉进井里的小狗儿一样，都是绕着圈打转儿的。我们就算费劲也要概括一下雅各布说这些话的因果。","It was just as the wagon dashed away that old Jacob Spraggins struck the sideboard with his fist and made the mysterious remark about ten thousand dollars that you perhaps remember.Which justifies the reflection that some stories, as well as life, and puppies thrown into wells, move around in circles.Painfully but briefly we must shed light on Jacob’s words."
"他发家的时候是二十岁。一个挖煤的穷矿工（也没听过富矿工吧？）攒了一两美元，在山边买了一小片地准备种玉米。可是欠收了。雅各布的鼻子就是探矿杖，他知道那地下有煤。他花了一百二十五美元从穷矿工那儿买了下来，一个月后又以一万美元的价格卖了出去。还好，穷矿工听闻这消息时，卖地剩下的钱还够他大喝一顿，再找个衣领朝后开的黑衣人为他送终。","The foundation of his fortune was made when he was twenty.A poor coal-digger (ever hear of a rich one?) had saved a dollar or two and bought a small tract of land on a hillside on which he tried to raise corn.Not a nubbin.Jacob, whose nose was a divining-rod, told him there was a vein of coal beneath.He bought the land from the miner for $125 and sold it a month afterward for $10,000.Luckily the miner had enough left of his sale money to drink himself into a black coat opening in the back, as soon as he heard the news."
"因此，四十年后，我们发现雅各布突然想到如果他可以用这笔钱来补偿穷矿工的继承人或是受让人，他的内心可能会好受一些。","And so, for forty years afterward, we find Jacob illuminated with the sudden thought that if he could make restitution of this sum of money to the heirs or assigns of the unlucky miner, respite and Nepenthe might be his."
"现在情节要加快，到这儿我们已经写了四千多字，还没流过一滴眼泪，开过一枪，讲过一个笑话，撬过一个保险箱或是一个酒瓶。","And now must come swift action, for we have here some four thousand words and not a tear shed and never a pistol, joke, safe, nor bottle cracked."
"老雅各布雇了十几个私家侦探去找老穷矿工麦克利奥德的后代，如果他有后代的话。","Old Jacob hired a dozen private detectives to find the heirs, if any existed, of the old miner, Hugh McLeod."
"搞明白了没？当然了，你我都知道托马斯就是那个后代。我本来应该隐去名字的，但是干嘛老要让你置身事外呢？我觉得，要让人们参与到故事中来，那他们就可以自己决定要不要看下去。","Get the point?Of course I know as well as you do that Thomas is going to be the heir.I might have concealed the name; but why always hold back your mystery till the end?I say, let it come near the middle so people can stop reading there if they want to."
"侦探根据错误的线索追踪了三千块之后——我是说三千英里之后——他们在杂货店遇到了托马斯，并得知休·麦克利奥德是他的祖父，祖父也没有另外的子嗣了。他们安排了一个上午，让他和老雅各布在他们的一个办公室里见面。","After the detectives had trailed false clues about three thousand dollars—I mean miles—they cornered Thomas at the grocery and got his confession that Hugh McLeod had been his grandfather, and that there were no other heirs.They arranged a meeting for him and old Jacob one morning in one of their offices."
"雅各布挺喜欢这个年轻人。他说话的时候正视雅各布的眼睛，把单车帽抛到桌子上的玫瑰花瓶的样子都很讨雅各布的欢心。","Jacob liked the young man very much.He liked the way he looked straight at him when he talked, and the way he threw his bicycle cap over the top of a rose-colored vase on the centre-table."
"雅各布的补偿方式还有一个小小的瑕疵。他没有意识到，这个补偿要圆满的话，还需要坦白。所以他说自己是那个买地人的代理，受其之托来还钱，这样他的心里就能宽慰一些。","There was a slight flaw in Jacob’s system of restitution.He did not consider that the act, to be perfect, should include confession.So he represented himself to be the agent of the purchaser of the land who had sent him to refund the sale price for the ease of his conscience."
"“先生，”托马斯说，“这对我来说听起来就像从南波士顿寄来的一张明信片上写着‘我们在这儿很开心’一样。我不明白这把戏。是一万美元现金呢，还是要我凑足赠券再去兑换？”","“Well, sir,” said Thomas, “this sounds to me like an illustrated post-card from South Boston with ‘We’re having a good time here’ written on it.I don’t know the game.Is this ten thousand dollars money, or do I have to save so many coupons to get it?”"
"老雅各布数了二十张五百美元大钞给他。","Old Jacob counted out to him twenty five-hundred-dollar bills."
"比起支票，他觉得还是现金更好。托马斯小心翼翼地把钱放到口袋里。","That was better, he thought, than a check.Thomas put them thoughtfully into his pocket."
"“我代爷爷感谢送钱的人。”他说。","“Grandfather’s best thanks,” he said, “to the party who sends it.”"
"雅各布继续闲谈，问了他的工作、爱好以及志向。他越看托马斯，越听他说话，越喜欢他。在巴格达他很少遇到年轻人如此诚恳坦率。","Jacob talked on, asking him about his work, how he spent his leisure time, and what his ambitions were.The more he saw and heard of Thomas, the better he liked him.He had not met many young men in Bagdad so frank and wholesome."
"“我想邀请你来我家，”他说，“我可以帮你投资和规划。我很有钱。我有个快成年的女儿，我想介绍你认识她。很多年轻人要拜访她，我同意的不多。”","“I would like to have you visit my house,” he said.“I might help you in investing or laying out your money.I am a very wealthy man.I have a daughter about grown, and I would like for you to know her.There are not many young men I would care to have call on her.”"
"“我很感激，”托马斯说，“我不太常去拜访别人家。走的也大多是边门。另外，我已经和一个能把特拉华桃花都比下去的女孩儿订婚了。他是我送货的人家的女佣。尽管她不会在那儿工作很久了。对了，不要忘了向你的朋友表示我爷爷对他的敬意。请原谅我，现在我的马车里还有很多蔬菜要去送。回见了，先生。”","“I’m obliged,” said Thomas.“I’m not much at making calls.It’s generally the side entrance for mine.And, besides, I’m engaged to a girl that has the Delaware peach crop killed in the blossom.She’s a parlor maid in a house where I deliver goods.She won’t be working there much longer, though.Say, don’t forget to give your friend my grandfather’s best regards.You’ll excuse me now; my wagon’s outside with a lot of green stuff that’s got to be delivered.See you again, sir.”"
"十一点的时候，托马斯送了些荷兰芹和莴苣到斯普拉金斯先生的别墅。托马斯只有二十二岁，因此，回来时，他把一把伍佰元大钞拿了出来，满不在乎地挥了挥。安妮特眼睛睁得跟奶油洋葱一样大，跑去找厨师。","At eleven Thomas delivered some bunches of parsley and lettuce at the Spraggins mansion.Thomas was only twenty-two; so, as he came back, he took out the handful of five-hundred-dollar bills and waved them carelessly.Annette took a pair of eyes as big as creamed onion to the cook."
"“我就跟你说过他是个伯爵，”把看到的讲述后，她说道，“怪不得他从来不理我。”","“I told you he was a count,” she said, after relating.“He never would carry on with me.”"
"“但是你说他把钱拿出来亮了亮。”厨师说。","“But you say he showed money,” said the cook."
"“成百上千呢，”安妮特说，“就随便地揣在他口袋里。他看都不看我一下。”","“Hundreds of thousands,” said Annette.“Carried around loose in his pockets.And he never would look at me.”"
"“这是今天拿到的，”托马斯跟西莉亚在外头解释，“是我爷爷的地产得来的钱。嘿，西莉亚，现在还等什么呢？我这就去辞了工作。我们干吗不在下礼拜结婚呢？”","“It was paid to me to-day,” Thomas was explaining to Celia outside.“It came from my grandfather’s estate.Say, Cele, what’s the use of waiting now?I’m going to quit the job to-night.Why can’t we get married next week?”"
"“汤米，”西莉亚说，“我不是个客厅女佣。我骗了你。我是斯普拉金斯小姐——西莉亚·斯普拉金斯。报纸上说我将来的身价会达到四千万。”","“Tommy,” said Celia.“I’m no parlor maid.I’ve been fooling you.I’m Miss Spraggins—Celia Spraggins.The newspapers say I’ll be worth forty million dollars some day.”"
"托马斯把他的帽子直接从头上拉了下来，自打我们认识他，这还是第一次。","Thomas pulled his cap down straight on his head for the first time since we have known him."
"“我想，”他说，“我想你下礼拜不会和我结婚了。但是，你吹口哨还是很棒的。”","“I suppose then,” said he, “I suppose then you’ll not be marrying me next week.But you can whistle.”"
"“是的，”西莉亚说，“我下礼拜是不会跟你结婚的。我爸爸不可能让我嫁个杂货店的伙计。可是我可以今晚嫁给你，汤米，如果你说今晚的话。”","“No,” said Celia, “I’ll not be marrying you next week.My father would never let me marry a grocer’s clerk.But I’ll marry you to-night, Tommy, if you say so.”"
"九点半，老雅各布·斯普拉金斯乘着他的小汽车回到了家。车的构造你就要靠自己猜想了，我写小说没有津贴，要是街上的公车我倒是可以告诉你轮子的数目和电压的大小。一到家，雅各布就喊女儿，他给她买了一条红宝石项链，希望听她夸夸自己是个慈爱、体贴、温和的好爸爸。","Old Jacob Spraggins came home at 9:30 P. M., in his motor car.The make of it you will have to surmise sorrowfully; I am giving you unsubsidized fiction; had it been a street car I could have told you its voltage and the number of wheels it had.Jacob called for his daughter; he had bought a ruby necklace for her, and wanted to hear her say what a kind, thoughtful, dear old dad he was."
"大家在房子里找了一圈，然后安妮特来了，她浑身散发着真挚和忠诚的火焰，其中也混杂着嫉妒和虚伪。","There was a brief search in the house for her, and then came Annette, glowing with the pure flame of truth and loyalty well mixed with envy and histrionics."
"“哦，先生，”她犹豫着要不要跪下，说道，“西莉亚小姐刚从边门和一个年轻男人逃跑了，他们要去结婚。我阻止不了她，先生。他们坐上了一辆出租车。”","“Oh, sir,” said she, wondering if she should kneel, “Miss Celia’s just this minute running away out of the side gate with a young man to be married.I couldn’t stop her, sir.They went in a cab.”"
"“什么年轻男人？”老雅各布咆哮道。","“What young man?” roared old Jacob."
"“一个百万富翁，对不起，先生——一个装作是有钱绅士的人。他带着他的钱，那些红辣椒和洋葱只是迷惑我们。他从来都不正眼瞧我。”","“A millionaire, if you please, sir—a rich nobleman in disguise.He carries his money with him, and the red peppers and the onions was only to blind us, sir.He never did seem to take to me.”"
"雅各布立刻冲出去叫住车子。司机在风中点了个烟，耽搁了一下。","Jacob rushed out in time to catch his car.The chauffeur had been delayed by trying to light a cigarette in the wind."
"“听着，加斯顿，或者麦克，不管你叫什么，快开到拐弯口看看能不能看到一辆出租车。看到的话，撞翻它。”","“Here, Gaston, or Mike, or whatever you call yourself, scoot around the corner quicker than blazes and see if you can see a cab.If you do, run it down.”"
"在一街区外有辆出租车就在眼前。加斯顿，或者麦克，半睁着眼心思还在香烟上，追到出租车利索地把车逼到路边停了下来。","There was a cab in sight a block away.Gaston, or Mike, with his eyes half shut and his mind on his cigarette, picked up the trail, neatly crowded the cab to the curb and pocketed it."
"“你搞什么鬼？”出租车司机大声叫道。","“What t’ell you doin’?” yelled the cabman."
"“爸爸！”西莉亚尖叫道。","“Pa!” shrieked Celia."
"“爷爷那内疚的朋友的代理人！”托马斯说，“不晓得他现在又要干什么。”","“Grandfather’s remorseful friend’s agent!” said Thomas.“Wonder what’s on his conscience now.”"
"“千雷轰顶，”加斯顿，或者麦克说道，“我没火柴了。”","“A thousand thunders,” said Gaston, or Mike.“I have no other match.”"
"“小伙子，”老雅各布严肃地说，“跟你订婚的那个客厅女佣呢？”","“Young man,” said old Jacob, severely, “how about that parlor maid you were engaged to?”"
"两三年后，雅各布走进他私人秘书的办公室。","A couple of years afterward old Jacob went into the office of his private secretary."
"“联合传教协会恳求三万美元的捐助，作为朝鲜改宗之用。”秘书说。","“The Amalgamated Missionary Society solicits a contribution of $30,000 toward the conversion of the Koreans,” said the secretary."
"“别管他们。”雅各布说。","“Pass ’em up,” said Jacob."
"“普拉姆维尔大学写信说你每年捐赠的五万基金已经过期了。”","“The University of Plumville writes that its yearly endowment fund of $50,000 that you bestowed upon it is past due.”"
"“跟他们说我撤资。”","“Tell ’em it’s been cut out.”"
"“长岛蛤湾的科学协会需要一万美元买酒精来保存标本。”","“The Scientific Society of Clam Cove, Long Island, asks for $10,000 to buy alcohol to preserve specimens.”"
"“浪费。”","“Waste basket.”"
"“职业妇女娱乐协会希望你抽出两万美元建一个高尔夫球场。”","“The Society for Providing Healthful Recreation for Working Girls wants $20,000 from you to lay out a golf course.”"
"“让她们见鬼去吧。”","“Tell ’em to see an undertaker.”"
"“统统取消，”雅各布继续道，“我已经善良够了。每块钱我都要搜刮来，攒起来。我要你写信给每个公司主管，告诉他们我有意减薪百分之十。另外——我走进门厅的时候看到角落里有半块肥皂。你去和清洁工说，要杜绝浪费。我的钱不是用来打水漂的。还有——醋价还是由我们控制，是吗？”","“Cut ’em all out,” went on Jacob.“I’ve quit being a good thing.I need every dollar I can scrape or save.I want you to write to the directors of every company that I’m interested in and recommend a 10 per cent. Cut in salaries.And say—I noticed half a cake of soap lying in a corner of the hall as I came in.I want you to speak to the scrubwoman about waste.I’ve got no money to throw away.And say—we’ve got vinegar pretty well in hand, haven’t we?’ "
"“寰球调料品公司，”秘书说，“现在控制着市场。”","“The Globe Spice & Seasons Company,” said secretary, “controls the market at present.”"
"“每加仑醋提高两美元。通知一下我们所有分公司的人。”","“Raise vinegar two cents a gallon.Notify all our branches.”"
"雅各布·斯普拉金斯胖胖的红脸立刻松垮下来，咧开嘴笑了。他走到秘书桌前把他食指上一个红色印记给秘书看。","Suddenly Jacob Spraggins’s plump red face relaxed into a pulpy grin.He walked over to the secretary’s desk and showed a small red mark on his thick forefinger."
"“被他咬的，”他说，“他的牙齿才长出来三个礼拜——杰克·麦克利奥德，我女儿西莉亚的孩子。要是我能攒够的话，到他二十一岁的时候就有一亿了。”","“Bit it,” he said, “darned if he didn’t, and he ain’t had the tooth three weeks—Jaky McLeod, my Celia’s kid.He’ll be worth a hundred millions by the time he’s twenty-one if I can pile it up for him.”"
"雅各布离开时，在门口转过身说道：","As he was leaving, old Jacob turned at the door, and said: "
"“不要涨两美分了，还是涨三美分更好。我一小时内回来在信上签字。”","“Better make that vinegar raise three cents instead of two.I’ll be back in an hour and sign the letters.”"
"哈伦·拉希德哈里发的真实历史是，在统治的后期，他厌倦了慈善事业，把他在“天方夜谈”漫游时的亲信和伙伴都砍了头。幸好我们处于这样幸福的时代，哈里发只能在账单上给我们判死刑。","The true history of the Caliph Harun Al Rashid relates that toward the end of his reign he wearied of philanthropy, and caused to be beheaded all his former favorites and companions of his “Arabian Nights” rambles.Happy are we in these days of enlightenment, when the only death warrant the caliphs can serve on us is in the form of a tradesman’s bill."
