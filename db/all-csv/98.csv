"带磨坊的教堂","The Church with an Overshot-Wheel"
"作者：欧·亨利","by O. Henry"
"在众多流行的避暑胜地的名单中是找不到湖地这个去处的。它位于克林奇河的一条小支流旁、坎伯兰山脉的低矮的支脉上。确切地说，湖地是一个令人满意的村庄，有二十四户人家，坐落于一条已经废弃的窄轨铁路线旁。你会疑惑究竟是铁路在松树林里迷失了自己，出于恐惧和孤独闯进了湖地，还是湖地迷了路，依偎在铁路身旁等候车辆带它回家。你还会好奇它为什么会叫湖地。没有湖，并且周围的土地贫瘠，丝毫不值得一提。","Lakelands is not to be found in the catalogues of fashionable summer resorts.It lies on a low spur of the Cumberland range of mountains on a little tributary of the Clinch River.Lakelands proper is a contented village of two dozen houses situated on a forlorn, narrow-gauge railroad line.You wonder whether the railroad lost itself in the pine woods and ran into Lakelands from fright and loneliness, or whether Lakelands got lost and huddled itself along the railroad to wait for the cars to carry it home.You wonder again why it was named Lakelands.There are no lakes, and the lands about are too poor to be worth mentioning."
"在离村子半英里处，有一家老鹰旅馆，店主叫乔赛亚·兰金，这是间古旧的大宅子，专为那些渴望呼吸山间空气的客人们提供实惠的膳宿。老鹰旅馆虽然管理不善，却让人感觉到快乐。它里面满是古色古香的而非现代化的设施，它舒适、随意、惬意、杂乱，给人一种家的感觉。但给你配备有窗明几净的房间和丰盛的食材：至于剩下的，只能交给你自己和这片松树林了。大自然提供了矿泉水、葡萄藤秋千、槌球场——甚至球门都是木制的。这里的人为技艺只有每周两次在乡村亭子里举行的舞会上的小提琴和吉他演奏了。","Half a mile from the village stands the Eagle House, a big, roomy old mansion run by Josiah Rankin for the accommodation of visitors who desire the mountain air at inexpensive rates.The Eagle House is delightfully mismanaged.It is full of ancient instead of modern improvements, and it is altogether as comfortably neglected and pleasingly disarranged as your own home.But you are furnished with clean rooms and good and abundant fare: yourself and the piny woods must do the rest.Nature has provided a mineral spring, grape-vine swings, and croquet—even the wickets are wooden.You have Art to thank only for the fiddle-and-guitar music twice a week at the hop in the rustic pavilion."
"老鹰旅馆的主顾们是那些把寻求娱乐看成是生活必需和乐趣的人。他们平日里忙忙碌碌，就像是钟表，上两星期的发条就能确保运行一年。在那里，你会看到来自南部城市的学生，时不时还会有艺术家或是潜心研究古山体结构的地理学家。有几个来这里避暑的安静的家庭，以及一两个被湖地人经常称为“女教师”的耐心而又疲惫的妇女。","The patrons of the Eagle House are those who seek recreation as a necessity, as well as a pleasure.They are busy people, who may be likened to clocks that need a fortnight’s winding to insure a year’s running of their wheels.You will find students there from the lower towns, now and then an artist, or a geologist absorbed in construing the ancient strata of the hills.A few quiet families spend the summers there; and often one or two tired members of that patient sisterhood known to Lakelands as “schoolmarms.”"
"如果老鹰旅馆要编印宣传册的话，那么离旅馆四分之一英里的那处向游客们介绍的“景点”一定在宣传册中。这是一座废弃的老旧磨坊。用乔赛亚·兰金的话来说，它是“美国唯一带有磨坊水车的教堂；也是世界上唯一带有教堂座位和管风琴的磨坊”。每逢安息日老鹰旅馆的客人们都会来到老磨坊教堂，听牧师把虔诚的基督徒比作是在阅历和苦难的磨盘下碾出来并筛干净的面粉。","A quarter of a mile from the Eagle House was what would have been described to its guests as “an object of interest” in the catalogue, had the Eagle House issued a catalogue.This was an old, old mill that was no longer a mill.In the words of Josiah Rankin, it was “the only church in the United States, sah, with an overshot-wheel; and the only mill in the world, sah, with pews and a pipe organ.”The guests of the Eagle House attended the old mill church each Sabbath, and heard the preacher liken the purified Christian to bolted flour ground to usefulness between the millstones of experience and suffering."
"每年大约初秋时，都会有个名叫艾布拉姆·斯特朗的人来到老鹰旅馆，在此逗留一段时间，并会受到当地人的尊敬，奉为座上宾。在湖地，他被亲切地称呼为“艾布拉姆神父”，因为他鹤发童颜、神情友善、笑声爽朗，他穿上黑衣，戴上宽沿帽的时候，十分像神父。即便是新旅客，经过三四天的接触后都会这么称呼他。","Every year about the beginning of autumn there came to the Eagle House one Abram Strong, who remained for a time an honoured and beloved guest.In Lakelands he was called “Father Abram,” because his hair was so white, his face so strong and kind and florid, his laugh so merry, and his black clothes and broad hat so priestly in appearance.Even new guests after three or four days’ acquaintance gave him this familiar title."
"艾布拉姆神父是走了很远的路才来到达湖地的。他住在西北部一个喧闹的大城市里，在那里他拥有几家磨粉厂，不是带有教堂座位和管风琴的小磨坊，而是堆成像山那么高的、奇丑无比的大型面粉厂。运面粉的列车整天来来回回，就像蚂蚁围着蚁冢打转一样。现在必须先交代一下艾布拉姆神父和这座教堂的相关事情，因为他们之间的故事紧密相连。","Father Abram came a long way to Lakelands.He lived in a big, roaring town in the Northwest where he owned mills, not little mills with pews and an organ in them, but great, ugly, mountain-like mills that the freight trains crawled around all day like ants around an ant-heap.And now you must be told about Father Abram and the mill that was a church, for their stories run together."
"当教堂还是磨坊的时候，斯特朗先生是磨粉厂主。当地找不到比他更快活、更忙碌、更幸福、浑身粘满面粉的磨坊主了。他住在磨坊对街的一间小屋里。他干活卖力，但他收取的费用却很少。山里人都不惜路途遥远将谷物送到他这里。","In the days when the church was a mill, Mr. Strong was the miller.There was no jollier, dustier, busier, happier miller in all the land than he.He lived in a little cottage across the road from the mill.His hand was heavy, but his toll was light, and the mountaineers brought their grain to him across many weary miles of rocky roads."
"对于这位磨坊主来说，小女儿阿格拉亚是他生命的全部乐趣。对于一个连走路都还摇摇晃晃、一头亚麻色头发的小娃娃来说，阿格拉亚的确是个不一般的名字。然而对山里人而言，他们更喜欢响亮气派的名字。她母亲是在一本书上看到这个名字的，于是就那么定了下来。由于经常使用，阿格拉亚本人小时候就不喜欢这名字，她执意让别人叫她“杜姆”。磨坊主和妻子常常竭力哄女儿说出这个神秘名字的来源，但都是无果而终。最后他们得出了一个理论。屋后小花园有一花圃的杜鹃，孩子对杜鹃有一种特殊的喜爱和兴趣。也许在她看来“杜姆”和她最爱的花的杰出名字存在着联系吧。","The delight of the miller’s life was his little daughter, Aglaia.That was a brave name, truly, for a flaxen-haired toddler; but the mountaineers love sonorous and stately names.The mother had encountered it somewhere in a book, and the deed was done.In her babyhood Aglaia herself repudiated the name, as far as common use went, and persisted in calling herself “Dums.”The miller and his wife often tried to coax from Aglaia the source of this mysterious name, but without results.At last they arrived at a theory.In the little garden behind the cottage was a bed of rhododendrons in which the child took a peculiar delight and interest.It may have been that she perceived in “Dums” a kinship to the formidable name of her favourite flowers."
"阿格拉亚四岁的时候，每天下午她都会和父亲在磨坊里演上几个小节目，只要天气允许，从未改变过。晚饭准备好后，她母亲会给她梳头，然后给她穿上一件干净的围裙，让她去对街的磨坊叫父亲回家。每当浑身粘满白色粉尘的磨坊主一见到女儿进磨坊门，便挥舞着手臂迎上去，唱起当地人都熟悉的一首磨坊主的老歌，歌词大意是这样的：","When Aglaia was four years old she and her father used to go through a little performance in the mill every afternoon, that never failed to come off, the weather permitting.When supper was ready her mother would brush her hair and put on a clean apron and send her across to the mill to bring her father home.When the miller saw her coming in the mill door he would come forward, all white with the flour dust, and wave his hand and sing an old miller’s song that was familiar in those parts and ran something like this:"
"“轮儿转，粉儿磨，满身灰尘的磨坊主真欢喜。他整天来把歌儿唱，他干活一点儿都不累啊，只要想起他的小宝贝啊。”","“The wheel goes round,The grist is ground,The dusty miller’s merry.He sings all day,His work is play,While thinking of his dearie.”"
"这时，阿格拉亚便会笑着向他跑去，并喊道：","Then Aglaia would run to him laughing, and call:"
"“爸——爸，带杜姆回家。”接着，磨坊主一把将她抱起，让她跨在肩上，一边哼着磨坊主之歌，一边走回家里吃饭。每天晚上，这一幕都会上演。","“Da-da, come take Dums home;” and the miller would swing her to his shoulder and march over to supper, singing the miller’s song.Every evening this would take place."
"一天，仅在她过完四岁生日后的一星期，阿格拉亚就失踪了。最后一次见到她的时候，她在小屋门前的路边摘野花。过了一会儿，她母亲曾出来看她是否走得太远，但她已经不见了。","One day, only a week after her fourth birthday, Aglaia disappeared.When last seen she was plucking wild flowers by the side of the road in front of the cottage.A little while later her mother went out to see that she did not stray too far away, and she was already gone."
"当然，大家都在竭尽全力地寻找她。街坊邻居们聚在一块儿，搜遍了方圆几英里内的树林和山岭。他们拖着脚步在磨坊水道和溪水闸下走了很长一段距离。他们根本没有发现她的踪迹。一两天前，曾有一家流浪人在附近的林子里露过营。大家猜测，孩子极有可能是被他们拐走的；可当镇里人追上他们的大车，并加以搜查后，并没有发现阿格拉亚。","Of course every effort was made to find her.The neighbours gathered and searched the woods and the mountains for miles around.They dragged every foot of the mill race and the creek for a long distance below the dam.Never a trace of her did they find.A night or two before there had been a family of wanderers camped in a grove near by.It was conjectured that they might have stolen the child; but when their wagon was overtaken and searched she could not be found."
"磨坊主在磨坊守候了将近两年，之后他找到她的希望也逐渐化为泡影。他携妻子迁到了西北部。几年之后，他成为了那片地区重要面粉城市之一的现代面粉厂老板。而斯特朗太太则深陷于丢失阿格拉亚的打击中不能自拔，搬家两年后便去世了，留下磨坊主独自承受悲伤。","The miller remained at the mill for nearly two years; and then his hope of finding her died out.He and his wife moved to the Northwest.In a few years he was the owner of a modern mill in one of the important milling cities in that region.Mrs. Strong never recovered from the shock caused by the loss of Aglaia, and two years after they moved away the miller was left to bear his sorrow alone."
"艾布拉姆·斯特朗富裕之后曾回过湖地和老磨坊。这景象对他而言太伤感，但他是个坚强的人，看上去总是开心善良。就在那一刻他萌生了想把老磨坊改造成教堂的念头。湖地太穷，根本建不起教堂；而山区的人更穷，帮不上什么忙。20英里以内没有礼拜的场所。","When Abram Strong became prosperous he paid a visit to Lakelands and the old mill.The scene was a sad one for him, but he was a strong man, and always appeared cheery and kindly.It was then that he was inspired to convert the old mill into a church.Lakelands was too poor to build one; and the still poorer mountaineers could not assist.There was no place of worship nearer than twenty miles."
"磨坊主尽可能不改变磨坊的外观。来教堂做礼拜的年轻人曾在慢慢腐烂的软木上刻下他们名字的首字母。水闸有一部分已经损毁，清澈的山泉倾泻而出，在布满岩石的涧底无拘无束地流淌着。磨坊内部的变化则比较大。当然，转轴、磨盘、皮带和滑轮一律换掉了。过道两旁各有一排长凳，在过道的尽头处则搭建出一个小平台和讲道坛。天花板三面是带座位的楼座，内部均有楼梯相通。楼座里还有一台管风琴——一台真正的管风琴，那是老磨坊教堂会众们的骄傲。菲比·萨默斯小姐是风琴手。每逢周日礼拜时，湖地的小男孩们都骄傲地轮流为她的风琴鼓风。教士班布里奇先生是位牧师，他骑着他的白色老马从松鼠隘口赶来，从未落下过一次礼拜。一切费用都由艾布拉姆·斯特朗承担。每年他都会发给传道士五百美元，给菲比小姐二百美元。","The miller altered the appearance of the mill as little as possible.The big overshot-wheel was left in its place.The young people who came to the church used to cut their initials in its soft and slowly decaying wood.The dam was partly destroyed, and the clear mountain stream rippled unchecked down its rocky bed.Inside the mill the changes were greater.The shafts and millstones and belts and pulleys were, of course, all removed.There were two rows of benches with aisles between, and a little raised platform and pulpit at one end.On three sides overhead was a gallery containing seats, and reached by a stairway inside.There was also an organ—a real pipe organ—in the gallery, that was the pride of the congregation of the Old Mill Church.Miss Phœbe Summers was the organist.The Lakelands boys proudly took turns at pumping it for her at each Sunday’s service.The Rev. Mr. Banbridge was the preacher, and rode down from Squirrel Gap on his old white horse without ever missing a service.And Abram Strong paid for everything.He paid the preacher five hundred dollars a year; and Miss Phœbe two hundred dollars."
"因此，为了纪念阿格拉亚，在这片她曾经生活过的社区，老磨坊教堂被改造成一处传播福音的地方。看上去这位孩子短暂的生命所带来的好处比许多活了七十年所带来的好处还要多。除此以外，艾布拉姆·斯特朗为了纪念她还竖起了一个纪念碑。","Thus, in memory of Aglaia, the old mill was converted into a blessing for the community in which she had once lived.It seemed that the brief life of the child had brought about more good than the three score years and ten of many.But Abram Strong set up yet another monument to her memory."
"他在西北部的面粉厂推出了一种名叫“阿格拉亚”的面粉，这种面粉均由最饱满、最优质的麦子磨制而成。当地人很快发现，“阿格拉亚”牌面粉有两种价格。一种是市场的最高价，另一种则是分文不取。","Out from his mills in the Northwest came the “Aglaia” flour, made from the hardest and finest wheat that could be raised.The country soon found out that the “Aglaia” flour had two prices.One was the highest market price, and the other was—nothing."
"每遇火灾、洪水、龙卷风、罢工或饥荒之类的灾难，人们生活赤贫的时候，厂家就会有火速运去一大批免费的“阿格拉亚”面粉。面粉被小心审慎地发放，免费赠予，饥民们无需付钱。后来形成了一种说法：哪个城市的贫民区发生了重大火灾，最先赶到现场的是消防署署长的车，接着是“阿格拉亚”面粉运货车，最后才是消防车。","Wherever there happened a calamity that left people destitute—a fire, a flood, a tornado, a strike, or a famine, there would go hurrying a generous consignment of the “Aglaia” at its “nothing” price.It was given away cautiously and judiciously, but it was freely given, and not a penny could the hungry ones pay for it.There got to be a saying that whenever there was a disastrous fire in the poor districts of a city the fire chief’s buggy reached the scene first, next the “Aglaia” flour wagon, and then the fire engines."
"因此，这就是艾布拉姆·斯特朗为阿格拉亚建的另一座纪念碑。在诗人的眼里，这个主题也许显得太过功利、缺乏美感；但在某些人眼里，这些雪白、纯净、纯洁的面粉正在履行着爱和慈善的使命，这面粉可以比作是失踪孩子的灵魂象征，想一想就觉得甜蜜美好。","So this was Abram Strong’s other monument to Aglaia.Perhaps to a poet the theme may seem too utilitarian for beauty; but to some the fancy will seem sweet and fine that the pure, white, virgin flour, flying on its mission of love and charity, might be likened to the spirit of the lost child whose memory it signalized."
"有一年，坎伯兰山一带遭遇了困难。各地谷物歉收，当地更是颗粒无收。山洪造成了巨大的财产损失。甚至连树林里的飞禽走兽也很稀少，猎人们捕获的东西还不够养家糊口。湖地一带情况尤为严峻。","There came a year that brought hard times to the Cumberlands.Grain crops everywhere were light, and there were no local crops at all.Mountain floods had done much damage to property.Even game in the woods was so scarce that the hunters brought hardly enough home to keep their folk alive.Especially about Lakelands was the rigour felt."
"艾布拉姆·斯特朗一得知消息，立刻发出指示；窄轨小铁路的车皮开始把“阿格拉亚”面粉运过去。他的吩咐是把面粉存放在老磨坊教堂的楼座里；每位去教堂礼拜的人都能扛袋面粉回家。","As soon as Abram Strong heard of this his messages flew; and the little narrow-gauge cars began to unload “Aglaia” flour there.The miller’s orders were to store the flour in the gallery of the Old Mill Church; and that every one who attended the church was to carry home a sack of it."
"两星期后，艾布拉姆·斯特朗来到老鹰旅馆进行他一年一次的度假，他又变身为“艾布拉姆神父”了。","Two weeks after that Abram Strong came for his yearly visit to the Eagle House, and became “Father Abram” again."
"那一季度老鹰旅馆的客人比往常少。他们中有个叫罗丝·切斯特的人。切斯特小姐从亚特兰大来到湖地，她在亚特兰大的一家百货公司工作。这是她生平第一次外出度假。百货公司经理的太太曾在老鹰旅馆避暑。她非常喜欢罗丝，并说服她到那里度三个星期的假。经理太太给兰金太太写了封信，兰金太太欣然亲自接待照顾罗丝。","That season the Eagle House had fewer guests than usual.Among them was Rose Chester.Miss Chester came to Lakelands from Atlanta, where she worked in a department store.This was the first vacation outing of her life.The wife of the store manager had once spent a summer at the Eagle House.She had taken a fancy to Rose, and had persuaded her to go there for her three weeks’ holiday.The manager’s wife gave her a letter to Mrs. Rankin, who gladly received her in her own charge and care."
"切斯特小姐身体十分单薄。她约摸20岁左右，由于长期在室内生活，她看上去面色苍白、弱不禁风。但是在湖地呆了一星期后，她容光焕发、精神饱满，她变漂亮了。当时是九月初，时逢坎伯兰山区风光最旖旎迷人之际。山间树木叶子秋色灿烂，人可以闻到香槟酒般的气息。夜晚凉风习习，使得老鹰旅馆的人想舒适地依偎在温暖的毛毯下躺着。","Miss Chester was not very strong.She was about twenty, and pale and delicate from an indoor life.But one week of Lakelands gave her a brightness and spirit that changed her wonderfully.The time was early September when the Cumberlands are at their greatest beauty.The mountain foliage was growing brilliant with autumnal colours; one breathed aerial champagne, the nights were deliciously cool, causing one to snuggle cosily under the warm blankets of the Eagle House."
"艾布拉姆神父和切斯特小姐成了至交。老磨坊主从兰金太太那里了解到了罗丝的故事，很快对这位身材修长、独自闯荡世界的姑娘产生了兴趣。","Father Abram and Miss Chester became great friends.The old miller learned her story from Mrs. Rankin, and his interest went out quickly to the slender lonely girl who was making her own way in the world."
"山间乡村对切斯特小姐来说十分新奇。她在亚特兰大那片温暖平坦的城市生活了多年；雄伟壮丽、丰富多彩的坎伯兰山区令她欣喜神往。她决定要充分享受她在这里的每分每秒。她量入为出，仔细清算开支；她甚至能清楚地知道在回去工作之前，她那捉襟见肘的积蓄里还剩多少盈余，甚至能精确到每一美分。","The mountain country was new to Miss Chester.She had lived many years in the warm, flat town of Atlanta; and the grandeur and variety of the Cumberlands delighted her.She was determined to enjoy every moment of her stay.Her little hoard of savings had been estimated so carefully in connection with her expenses that she knew almost to a penny what her very small surplus would be when she returned to work."
"有艾布拉姆神父为友为伴真是切斯特小姐莫大的福气。他熟知湖地周围的每一条山路、山头和山坡。通过他，她郑重而又高兴地熟悉了松树林里恬静阴翳的斜径、肃穆光秃的岩崖、使人精神振奋的澄明清晨和充满神秘气息又带些淡淡哀愁、如梦如幻的金色傍晚。因此，她的身体和精神状况均有所好转。艾布拉姆神父的笑声是出了名的，而罗丝小姐亲切热情又极具女人味的笑声极像他的笑声。他们两人都是天生的乐天派，都知道该怎样把平静、愉悦的表情呈现给这个世界。","Miss Chester was fortunate in gaining Father Abram for a friend and companion.He knew every road and peak and slope of the mountains near Lakelands.Through him she became acquainted with the solemn delight of the shadowy, tilted aisles of the pine forests, the dignity of the bare crags, the crystal, tonic mornings, the dreamy, golden afternoons full of mysterious sadness.So her health improved, and her spirits grew light.She had a laugh as genial and hearty in its feminine way as the famous laugh of Father Abram.Both of them were natural optimists; and both knew how to present a serene and cheerful face to the world."
"一天，切斯特小姐从一位客人那里听说了艾布拉姆神父丢失孩子的事情。她匆匆跑到矿泉附近，在老磨坊主心爱的那条长凳上找到了他。当这位忘年交眼含泪水，紧握着他的双手时，他感到万分惊讶。","One day Miss Chester learned from one of the guests the history of Father Abram’s lost child.Quickly she hurried away and found the miller seated on his favourite rustic bench near the chalybeate spring.He was surprised when his little friend slipped her hand into his, and looked at him with tears in her eyes."
"“噢，艾布拉姆神父，”她说道，“我真替你难过！直到今天我才知道有关你小女儿的事情。终有一天你会找到她的——噢，希望你能找到。”","“Oh, Father Abram,” she said, “I’m so sorry!I didn’t know until to-day about your little daughter.You will find her yet some day—Oh, I hope you will.”"
"磨坊主带着他那一贯坚强的笑容看着她。","The miller looked down at her with his strong, ready smile."
"“谢谢你，罗丝小姐，”他用像往常那样欢快的语气说道，“但我已经不指望能找着阿格拉亚了。在过去的几年中，我曾希望她是被流浪人给拐走了，并且希望她还活着；可是我已经不抱任何希望了。我相信她已经溺水身亡了。”","“Thank you, Miss Rose,” he said, in his usual cheery tones.“But I do not expect to find Aglaia.For a few years I hoped that she had been stolen by vagrants, and that she still lived; but I have lost that hope.I believe that she was drowned.”"
"“我能理解，”切斯特小姐说道，“这种忧心不安是那么令人难以忍受。然而你是那么地开朗，乐于帮助他人减轻负担。善良的艾布拉姆神父！”","“I can understand,” said Miss Chester, “how the doubt must have made it so hard to bear.And yet you are so cheerful and so ready to make other people’s burdens light.Good Father Abram!”"
"“善良的罗丝小姐！”磨坊主笑着模仿她的口气说道，“有谁会比你更善解人意呢？”","“Good Miss Rose!” mimicked the miller, smiling.“Who thinks of others more than you do?”"
"切斯特小姐突然有了个异想天开的想法。","A whimsical mood seemed to strike Miss Chester."
"“噢，艾布拉姆神父，”她喊道，“如果能证明我是你的女儿，不是很好吗？你不觉得这很浪漫吗？你愿意让我做你的女儿吗？”","“Oh, Father Abram,” she cried, “wouldn’t it be grand if I should prove to be your daughter?Wouldn’t it be romantic?And wouldn’t you like to have me for a daughter?”"
"“当然，我愿意，”磨坊主由衷地说道，“如果阿格拉亚还活着的话，我真希望她能长成像你这般的少女。也许你就是阿格拉亚呢，”接着他用类似玩笑般的口吻问道，“你还记得我们住在磨坊里的日子吗？”","“Indeed, I would,” said the miller, heartily.“If Aglaia had lived I could wish for nothing better than for her to have grown up to be just such a little woman as you are.Maybe you are Aglaia,” he continued, falling in with her playful mood; “can’t you remember when we lived at the mill?”"
"切斯特小姐立即陷入了严肃的沉思。她那双盯着远处的大眼越来越模糊。艾布拉姆神父被她迅速转为严肃的样子给逗乐了。她坐了良久才开口。","Miss Chester fell swiftly into serious meditation.Her large eyes were fixed vaguely upon something in the distance.Father Abram was amused at her quick return to seriousness.She sat thus for a long time before she spoke."
"“不，”最后她长叹一声说道，“我记不起任何有关磨坊的事。我想在看到你那滑稽的小教堂之前，我一生中从没见过面粉磨坊。假如我是你的小女儿的话，我应该记得的，不是吗？我很抱歉，艾布拉姆神父。”","“No,” she said at length, with a long sigh, “I can’t remember anything at all about a mill.I don’t think that I ever saw a flour mill in my life until I saw your funny little church.And if I were your little girl I would remember it, wouldn’t I?I’m so sorry, Father Abram.”"
"“我也是，”艾布拉姆神父顺着她说道，“但如果你不记得是我的女儿，罗丝小姐，那你应该能够回忆起你是别人的女儿。当然，你记得你自己的父母。”","“So am I,” said Father Abram, humouring her.“But if you cannot remember that you are my little girl, Miss Rose, surely you can recollect being some one else’s.You remember your own parents, of course.”"
"“噢，是的；我很清楚地记得他们——尤其是我的父亲。他和你一点儿也不一样，艾布拉姆神父。哎，我只是假装罢了；现在来吧，你休息得够久了。你答应过今天下午要带我去池塘看鳟鱼玩耍的。我还从没见过鳟鱼呢。”","“Oh, yes; I remember them very well—especially my father.He wasn’t a bit like you, Father Abram.Oh, I was only making believe: Come, now, you’ve rested long enough.You promised to show me the pool where you can see the trout playing, this afternoon.I never saw a trout.”"
"一天傍晚，艾布拉姆神父独自一人去了老磨坊。他时常去那里坐坐，追忆过去住在对街小屋里的时光。时光已经磨平了他悲伤的棱角，以至于他回想过去时已经没有以前那么痛苦了。然而，每逢令人感伤的九月来临，午后当艾布拉姆·斯特朗坐在昔日“杜姆”每天扬着亚麻色发卷飞奔过来的地方时，湖地人发现他脸上常挂着的笑容不在了。","Late one afternoon Father Abram set out for the old mill alone.He often went to sit and think of the old days when he lived in the cottage across the road.Time had smoothed away the sharpness of his grief until he no longer found the memory of those times painful.But whenever Abram Strong sat in the melancholy September afternoons on the spot where “Dums” used to run in every day with her yellow curls flying, the smile that Lakelands always saw upon his face was not there."
"路边的树木分布很密，于是他把帽子脱掉拿在手中，在树阴下走着。在他右边的老栅栏上松鼠们正在追逐嬉戏着。麦茬地上鹌鹑们在召唤着它们的孩子。低沉的太阳把朝西的沟壑染成一片金色。九月初——仅再过几天又是阿格拉亚失踪的周年纪念日了。","The miller made his way slowly up the winding, steep road.The trees crowded so close to the edge of it that he walked in their shade, with his hat in his hand.Squirrels ran playfully upon the old rail fence at his right.Quails were calling to their young broods in the wheat stubble.The low sun sent a torrent of pale gold up the ravine that opened to the west.Early September!—it was within a few days only of the anniversary of Aglaia’s disappearance."
"温暖的阳光透过树林，斑斑驳驳地洒在被常春藤遮去一半的老水车上。对街的小屋依旧立在原地，不过要是再经过一个冬天的山风吹打，它一定会坍塌。小屋外面攀满了牵牛花和野葫芦藤，门上挂着一条锁链。","The old overshot-wheel, half covered with mountain ivy, caught patches of the warm sunlight filtering through the trees.The cottage across the road was still standing, but it would doubtless go down before the next winter’s mountain blasts.It was overrun with morning glory and wild gourd vines, and the door hung by one hinge."
"艾布拉姆神父推开磨坊的门，轻轻地走了进去。然后他惊讶地站着不动了。他听到从里边传来的某人伤心的啜泣声。他看了看，发现切斯特小姐坐在幽暗处的条凳上，低着头，手上持一封拆开的信。","Father Abram pushed open the mill door, and entered softly.And then he stood still, wondering.He heard the sound of some one within, weeping inconsolably.He looked, and saw Miss Chester sitting in a dim pew, with her head bowed upon an open letter that her hands held."
"艾布拉姆神父向她走去，把一只有力的手坚实地放在罗丝的手上。她抬起头，嘴里念叨着他的名字，并欲作进一步解释。","Father Abram went to her, and laid one of his strong hands firmly upon hers.She looked up, breathed his name, and tried to speak further."
"“先别说了，罗丝小姐，”磨坊主亲切地说道，“先别说话。你伤心的时候，静静地好好哭上一场是最好不过的了。”","“Not yet, Miss Rose,” said the miller, kindly.“Don’t try to talk yet.There’s nothing as good for you as a nice, quiet little cry when you are feeling blue.”"
"经历过无数磨难的老磨坊主似乎像魔术师一般，能够替他人驱赶悲伤。切斯特小姐的啜泣声逐渐平息了下来。不一会儿，她掏出她的小手帕拭去滴落在艾布拉姆神父大手上的几滴眼泪。随后她抬起头，挂着眼泪笑了。切斯特小姐总能破涕为笑，正如艾布拉姆神父沉浸在他自己的悲痛中时能强颜欢笑一样。就这点看来，两人是十分相似的。","It seemed that the old miller, who had known so much sorrow himself, was a magician in driving it away from others.Miss Chester’s sobs grew easier.Presently she took her little plain-bordered handkerchief and wiped away a drop or two that had fallen from her eyes upon Father Abram’s big hand.Then she looked up and smiled through her tears.Miss Chester could always smile before her tears had dried, just as Father Abram could smile through his own grief.In that way the two were very much alike."
"磨坊主没有问她太多问题；但不一会儿，切斯特小姐开始自己对他说了。","The miller asked her no questions; but by and by Miss Chester began to tell him."
"还是那个对年轻人来说意义重大、并能勾起年长者对过去美好追忆的古老故事。可以猜到，主题依旧是爱情。在亚特兰大有一个年轻的小伙子，温文尔雅、风度翩翩，他发现切斯特小姐也具有这些品质，这品质比亚特兰大、或是从格林兰岛到巴塔哥尼亚之间任何地方的任何人都高尚。她把那封让她落泪的信给艾布拉姆神父看。同温文尔雅的年轻人所写的情书风格一样，那封信充满了男子汉的气概和柔情，有些言过其实、急不可耐。他要求立即同切斯特小姐结婚。他说，由于她外出为期三周的度假，他简直无法忍受生活的煎熬。他请求立即得到答复；如果她同意的话，他不会坐窄轨铁路火车，而会立刻飞到湖地来。","It was the old story that always seems so big and important to the young, and that brings reminiscent smiles to their elders.Love was the theme, as may be supposed.There was a young man in Atlanta, full of all goodness and the graces, who had discovered that Miss Chester also possessed these qualities above all other people in Atlanta or anywhere else from Greenland to Patagonia.She showed Father Abram the letter over which she had been weeping.It was a manly, tender letter, a little superlative and urgent, after the style of love letters written by young men full of goodness and the graces.He proposed for Miss Chester’s hand in marriage at once.Life, he said, since her departure for a three-weeks’ visit, was not to be endured.He begged for an immediate answer; and if it were favourable he promised to fly, ignoring the narrow-gauge railroad, at once to Lakelands."
"“那么现在的问题究竟出在哪儿呢？”磨坊主看完信后问道。","“And now where does the trouble come in?” asked the miller when he had read the letter."
"“我不能嫁给他。”切斯特小姐说道。","“I cannot marry him,” said Miss Chester."
"“那你想嫁给他么？”艾布拉姆神父问道。","“Do you want to marry him?” asked Father Abram."
"“噢，我爱他，”她答道，“但是——”她低头又抽噎起来。","“Oh, I love him,” she answered, “but—”Down went her head and she sobbed again."
"“别这样，罗丝小姐，”磨坊主说，“你可以把秘密告诉我。我不会询问你，但我想你可以信任我。”","“Come, Miss Rose,” said the miller; “you can give me your confidence.I do not question you, but I think you can trust me.”"
"“我当然信任你，”这位姑娘说道，“我这就告诉你我为什么必须拒绝拉夫尔。我什么都不是，我甚至连个名字也没有；我的姓名是谎报的。拉夫尔是个有头有脸的人。我全心全意地爱着他，但我永远不能成为他的妻子。”","“I do trust you,” said the girl.“I will tell you why I must refuse Ralph.I am nobody; I haven’t even a name; the name I call myself is a lie.Ralph is a noble man.I love him with all my heart, but I can never be his.”"
"“这是什么话？”艾布拉姆神父说道，“你说你记得你的父母，怎么又说你没有姓名呢？我不明白。”","“What talk is this?” said Father Abram.“You said that you remember your parents.Why do you say you have no name?I do not understand.”"
"“我确实记得我的父母，”切斯特小姐说，“我记得很清楚。关于我们生活的最早记忆是在南方的一个很遥远的某个地方。我们搬过好几次家，在好几个城市和州住过。我摘过棉花，在工厂打过工，常常过着吃不饱、穿不暖的生活。母亲有时待我不错，但我的父亲则总是很残忍，还打我。我觉得他们俩都不务正业、居无定所。","“I do remember them,” said Miss Chester.“I remember them too well.My first recollections are of our life somewhere in the far South.We moved many times to different towns and states.I have picked cotton, and worked in factories, and have often gone without enough food and clothes.My mother was sometimes good to me; my father was always cruel, and beat me.I think they were both idle and unsettled."
"“记得我们住在亚特兰大附近一个河畔小镇的一天晚上，他们俩大吵了一架。正当他们互相指责谩骂的时候，我才知道——噢，艾布拉姆神父——我没有任何权利——你明白吗？我甚至连拥有姓名的权利也没有，我什么都不是。","“One night when we were living in a little town on a river near Atlanta they had a great quarrel.It was while they were abusing and taunting each other that I learned—oh, Father Abram, I learned that I didn’t even have the right to be—don’t you understand?I had no right even to a name; I was nobody."
"“那晚我逃了出来，徒步走到了亚特兰大，并且找到了一份工作。我给自己取名叫罗丝·切斯特，从那以后，我自食其力。现在你该明白我为什么不能嫁给拉夫尔了吧——哎，我永远也不能告诉他真相。”","“I ran away that night.I walked to Atlanta and found work.I gave myself the name of Rose Chester, and have earned my own living ever since.Now you know why I cannot marry Ralph—and, oh, I can never tell him why.”"
"对于她的不幸，艾布拉姆神父表示了藐视；那比同情要好，比怜悯有用。","Better than any sympathy, more helpful than pity, was Father Abram’s depreciation of her woes."
"“为什么？亲爱的，亲爱的！就因为这吗？”他说道，“荒谬，太荒谬了！”“我还以为是有什么阻碍呢！如果这位完美的年轻小伙子是个男人的话，他根本不会介意你的家庭。亲爱的罗丝小姐，相信我，他在意的是你本人。坦率地告诉他，正如你对我说的这样，我保证他对你的故事会付之一笑，并会因此对你有更高的评价。”","“Why, dear, dear! is that all?” he said.“Fie, fie!I thought something was in the way.If this perfect young man is a man at all he will not care a pinch of bran for your family tree.Dear Miss Rose, take my word for it, it is yourself he cares for.Tell him frankly, just as you have told me, and I’ll warrant that he will laugh at your story, and think all the more of you for it.”"
"“我永远都不会告诉他的，”切斯特小姐伤心地说道，“并且我永远不会同他或是其他任何人结婚，我没有权利。”","“I shall never tell him,” said Miss Chester, sadly.“And I shall never marry him nor any one else.I have not the right.”"
"但他们发现洒满阳光的路上有一条长影子，旁边还有一条短些的影子；不久只见有两个陌生人朝教堂走来。长影子的是来练琴的风琴师菲比·萨默，短一点儿的影子是年仅12岁的汤米·蒂格。今天轮到汤米为菲比小姐拉风箱，他的赤脚骄傲地激起身后路上尘土一片。","But they saw a long shadow come bobbing up the sunlit road.And then came a shorter one bobbing by its side; and presently two strange figures approached the church.The long shadow was made by Miss Phœbe Summers, the organist, come to practise.Tommy Teague, aged twelve, was responsible for the shorter shadow.It was Tommy’s day to pump the organ for Miss Phœbe, and his bare toes proudly spurned the dust of the road."
"菲比小姐身穿一件印有丁香花图案的布裙，她精致的小发卷垂在耳朵两侧，向艾布拉姆神父行过大屈膝礼后，她冲切斯特小姐礼貌地点了点头。接着她同她的助手爬上陡峭的楼梯，走进了管风琴阁楼。","Miss Phœbe, in her lilac-spray chintz dress, with her accurate little curls hanging over each ear, courtesied low to Father Abram, and shook her curls ceremoniously at Miss Chester.Then she and her assistant climbed the steep stairway to the organ loft."
"艾布拉姆神父和切斯特小姐继续呆在下面的教堂的阴影里。他们都不做声，很可能他们在忙着回忆。切斯特小姐用她的手支着头坐着，她的眼睛呆呆地望着远方。艾布拉姆神父站在旁边的那条长凳那里，若有所思地望着门外那条小道和那间破败的小屋。","In the gathering shadows below, Father Abram and Miss Chester lingered.They were silent; and it is likely that they were busy with their memories.Miss Chester sat, leaning her head on her hand, with her eyes fixed far away.Father Abram stood in the next pew, looking thoughtfully out of the door at the road and the ruined cottage."
"突然他头脑中的场景回到了20年前。因为汤米拉风箱的时候，菲比小姐按下风琴的低音键，来试试鼓进来的风量是否充足。在艾布拉姆神父看来，教堂已不复存在了。回响在小木板屋里那沉重低沉的嗡嗡声不是从管风琴里发出来的音符，而是磨坊机发出的轰隆声。他真切地感受到老水车在转动；他又回来了，那个山区老磨坊里，总是浑身粘满面粉的快乐磨坊主。此刻，天色已晚，阿格拉亚马上就要扬着迎风飘扬的发卷、摇摇晃晃地从对街走来，喊他回家吃晚饭了。艾布拉姆神父的眼睛死死地盯着小屋的那扇破门。","Suddenly the scene was transformed for him back almost a score of years into the past.For, as Tommy pumped away, Miss Phœbe struck a low bass note on the organ and held it to test the volume of air that it contained.The church ceased to exist, so far as Father Abram was concerned.The deep, booming vibration that shook the little frame building was no note from an organ, but the humming of the mill machinery.He felt sure that the old overshot-wheel was turning; that he was back again, a dusty, merry miller in the old mountain mill.And now evening was come, and soon would come Aglaia with flying colours, toddling across the road to take him home to supper.Father Abram’s eyes were fixed upon the broken door of the cottage."
"紧接着另外一件奇怪的事又发生了。上面楼座里堆着一排排的面粉袋。其中有一袋可能被一只老鼠咬过；风箱里发出深沉厚重的震动使面粉透过楼座的地板缝倾泻而下，把艾布拉姆神父从头到脚洒了个遍。然后老磨坊主走到过道中间，挥起他的手臂，唱起了磨坊主之歌：","And then came another wonder.In the gallery overhead the sacks of flour were stacked in long rows.Perhaps a mouse had been at one of them; anyway the jar of the deep organ note shook down between the cracks of the gallery floor a stream of flour, covering Father Abram from head to foot with the white dust.And then the old miller stepped into the aisle, and waved his arms and began to sing the miller’s song:"
"“轮儿转，粉儿磨，磨坊主真欢喜。”","“The wheel goes round,The grist is ground,The dusty miller’s merry.”"
"——紧接着奇迹继续上演。切斯特小姐从她的长凳上向前探了探身，她的脸像面粉一样煞白，仿佛从梦中惊醒般、睁大双眼看着艾布拉姆神父。他张口的那一刻，罗丝嘴唇翕动，向他张开双臂，她用恍恍惚惚的语气喊她：“爸——爸，带杜姆回家！”","—and then the rest of the miracle happened.Miss Chester was leaning forward from her pew, as pale as the flour itself, her wide-open eyes staring at Father Abram like one in a waking dream.When he began the song she stretched out her arms to him; her lips moved; she called to him in dreamy tones: “Da-da, come take Dums home!”"
"菲比小姐松开了风琴的低音键。但她出色地完成了她的工作。她按下的音符打开了一扇紧闭的记忆之门；艾布拉姆神父把他丢失的阿格拉亚紧紧地搂在怀里。","Miss Phœbe released the low key of the organ.But her work had been well done.The note that she struck had beaten down the doors of a closed memory; and Father Abram held his lost Aglaia close in his arms."
"当你去湖地的时候，他们还会告诉你更多的故事。他们会告诉你后来追查的概况，磨坊主女儿的故事终于真相大白了，原来是流浪的吉卜赛人对她年轻的美貌动了心，在九月的一天拐走了她。不过，你得先在老鹰旅馆阴翳的门廊里舒舒服服地坐上一会儿，然后你才能自在地听到故事。伴随着菲比小姐深沉厚重的低音琴声，我们的故事也最好在此结束。","When you visit Lakelands they will tell you more of this story.They will tell you how the lines of it were afterward traced, and the history of the miller’s daughter revealed after the gipsy wanderers had stolen her on that September day, attracted by her childish beauty.But you should wait until you sit comfortably on the shaded porch of the Eagle House, and then you can have the story at your ease.It seems best that our part of it should close while Miss Phœbe’s deep bass note was yet reverberating softly."
"可是我认为发生的这一切的最精彩部分还属艾比拉姆神父和他女儿走回老鹰旅馆时的情景，漫漫黄昏下，两人都激动地说不出话来。","And yet, to my mind, the finest thing of it all happened while Father Abram and his daughter were walking back to the Eagle House in the long twilight, almost too glad to speak."
"“爸爸，”她有些胆怯地、迟疑地问道，“你有很多钱吗？”","“Father,” she said, somewhat timidly and doubtfully, “have you a great deal of money?”"
"“很多？”磨坊主说，“呃，那得看情况了。除非你想买月亮或是其他很昂贵的东西，否则可以算得上是吧。”","“A great deal?” said the miller.“Well, that depends.There is plenty unless you want to buy the moon or something equally expensive.”"
"“那往亚特兰大打个电话是不是要花很多很多钱啊？”一向对钱精打细算的阿格拉亚问道。","“Would it cost very, very much,” asked Aglaia, who had always counted her dimes so carefully, “to send a telegram to Atlanta?”"
"“啊，”艾布拉姆神父轻叹一声说，“我知道了，你想让拉夫尔来。”","“Ah,” said Father Abram, with a little sigh, “I see.You want to ask Ralph to come.”"
"阿格拉亚抬头看他时脸上露出了温柔的笑容。","Aglaia looked up at him with a tender smile."
"“我想让他等我，”她说，“我刚找到我的父亲，我希望我们俩能多呆会儿。我想告诉他，他可能得等等了。”","“I want to ask him to wait,” she said.“I have just found my father, and I want it to be just we two for a while.I want to tell him he will have to wait.”"
