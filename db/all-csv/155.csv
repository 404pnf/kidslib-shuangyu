"有伤疤的人","The Man with the Gash"
"作者：杰克·伦敦","by Jack London"
"雅各布·肯特一生都为贪念所累。他转而逐渐产生了不信任人的心理，想法和性格都变得十分乖张，而他也成了一个极难相处的人。他还有梦游的毛病，脾气也很固执。他打小就是一个织布工人，直到前往克朗代克淘金的狂热渗入了他的血液，他才同织布机分离开来。他有间小屋坐落在六十英里驿和斯图亚特河之间；经常往来于这条通往道森路上的人们把肯特比作雄踞在山上，并向通过他这条保养极差的道路的商队勒索过路费的强盗大王。这样描绘他多少需要一点历史知识，而那些从斯图亚特河过来的大字不识几个的旅人们，往往用更原始的方法形容他，用的多是一些粗鲁的字眼。","Jacob Kent had suffered from cupidity all the days of his life.This, in turn, had engendered a chronic distrustfulness, and his mind and character had become so warped that he was a very disagreeable man to deal with.He was also a victim to somnambulic propensities, and very set in his ideas.He had been a weaver of cloth from the cradle, until the fever of Klondike had entered his blood and torn him away from his loom.His cabin stood midway between Sixty Mile Post and the Stuart River; and men who made it a custom to travel the trail to Dawson, likened him to a robber baron, perched in his fortress and exacting toll from the caravans that used his ill-kept roads.Since a certain amount of history was required in the construction of this figure, the less cultured wayfarers from Stuart River were prone to describe him after a still more primordial fashion, in which a command of strong adjectives was to be chiefly noted."
"其实，小屋也不是他的。那是好些年前几个探矿的人为了储存粮食，顺水放来一堆原木搭起来的。他们很热情好客，来者不拒；他们不要这间屋子后，认得这条路的过往旅人就把这里当成过夜的地方。这里很方便，省去了他们搭帐篷的时间和气力；只有一条不成文的规矩：最后一个离开的人，必须给后来的人留下一堆整整齐齐的木柴。几乎每一夜都有六七个甚至二十几个人挤进来躲避风霜雨雪。雅各布·肯特看到了这些情况，于是擅自霸占了这个屋子，自己搬了进去。从此以后，疲乏的旅人们不得不每人给一美元，才能享受睡地板的待遇；雅各布·肯特在称金砂的时候，也从来不忘做点手脚昧下一星半点。此外，他还总能找到理由让过路的客人们给他劈柴打水。这简直就是强盗行径，但是被他欺负的人们都是忠厚之辈，他们虽然憎恶他，却也由着他靠这种罪恶的勾当赚得盆满钵满。","This cabin was not his, by the way, having been built several years previously by a couple of miners who had got out a raft of logs at that point for a grub-stake.They had been most hospitable lads, and, after they abandoned it, travelers who knew the route made it an object to arrive there at nightfall.It was very handy, saving them all the time and toil of pitching camp; and it was an unwritten rule that the last man left a neat pile of firewood for the next comer.Rarely a night passed but from half a dozen to a score of men crowded into its shelter.Jacob Kent noted these things, exercised squatter sovereignty, and moved in.Thenceforth, the weary travelers were mulcted a dollar per head for the privilege of sleeping on the floor, Jacob Kent weighing the dust and never failing to steal the down-weight.Besides, he so contrived that his transient guests chopped his wood for him and carried his water.This was rank piracy, but his victims were an easy-going breed, and while they detested him, they yet permitted him to flourish in his sins."
"四月的一天下午，他坐在自家门口——怎么看都像一只等着捕食的蜘蛛——他一边惊讶于春天的阳光居然这样温暖，一边盯着路上，期待下一个他可以盘剥的苍蝇出现。育空河就在他脚下，像一大片冰的海洋，冰块铺满两岸之间足足两英里宽的空间，在南北两个拐弯处才消失不见。在并不平坦的冰面上，有一条雪橇犁出来的路，只是一条细长的、凹进去的痕迹，十八英寸宽，两千英里长；沿路每一英尺路上人们因道路艰险而吐出的咒骂，比世界上任何地方都多。","One afternoon in April he sat by his door,—for all the world like a predatory spider,—marvelling at the heat of the returning sun, and keeping an eye on the trail for prospective flies.The Yukon lay at his feet, a sea of ice, disappearing around two great bends to the north and south, and stretching an honest two miles from bank to bank.Over its rough breast ran the sled-trail, a slender sunken line, eighteen inches wide and two thousand miles in length, with more curses distributed to the linear foot than any other road in or out of all Christendom."
"那天下午，雅各布·肯特感觉好极了。昨夜，他打破了记录，一共接待了二十八位来客。这夜他固然是睡得不好，因为四个人在他床下打了一夜的呼噜，但是他那个装金砂的袋子也增添了可观的分量。那个装着闪闪发光的黄金的袋子，是他存在的主要乐趣所在，也是主要痛苦所在。袋子的小口里面的，即是天堂，也是地狱。他的房子只有一间屋子，自然也就谈不上私密性了，因此他总是害怕金子遭窃，为此备受煎熬。那些胡子拉茬、看起来就像亡命徒的陌生人可以毫不费劲地偷走金子。他常常梦见金子被偷，也总是从噩梦中惊醒。在梦中惊扰他的总是那么几个强盗，他简直都能记清楚他们的样子了，尤其是那个古铜色皮肤、右脸上有一道伤疤的强盗头子。几个人中，他梦见这个强盗的次数最多；因为他，肯特在醒着的时候，在房子里里外外造了好几十个藏金子的地方。每藏到一个新的地方，他就能松口气，或许能有几夜安睡，然后又梦见那个脸上带着伤疤的家伙正挖出他的钱袋，而他一把抓住那人的领子。这里照例有一番争斗，他也会惊醒，然后马上翻身起床，把袋子藏到一个更巧妙的地方去。他其实并不是直接受到幻觉的蛊惑，只不过他相信预兆，相信心灵可通；他认为梦里的强盗都是真人的灵魂投影，这些人，不管他们身在何处，都恰巧在他做梦的时候，在心里觊觎他的财富。因此，他继续盘剥每一个跨进他门槛的倒霉蛋；他的口袋里每多一盎司金子，他的烦恼也增添一分。","Jacob Kent was feeling particularly good that afternoon.The record had been broken the previous night, and he had sold his hospitality to no less than twenty-eight visitors.True, it had been quite uncomfortable, and four had snored beneath his bunk all night; but then it had added appreciable weight to the sack in which he kept his gold dust.That sack, with its glittering yellow treasure, was at once the chief delight and the chief bane of his existence.Heaven and hell lay within its slender mouth.In the nature of things, there being no privacy to his one-roomed dwelling, he was tortured by a constant fear of theft.It would be very easy for these bearded, desperate-looking strangers to make away with it.Often he dreamed that such was the case, and awoke in the grip of nightmare.A select number of these robbers haunted him through his dreams, and he came to know them quite well, especially the bronzed leader with the gash on his right cheek.This fellow was the most persistent of the lot, and, because of him, he had, in his waking moments, constructed several score of hiding-places in and about the cabin.After a concealment he would breathe freely again, perhaps for several nights, only to collar the Man with the Gash in the very act of unearthing the sack.Then, on awakening in the midst of the usual struggle, he would at once get up and transfer the bag to a new and more ingenious crypt.It was not that he was the direct victim of these phantasms; but he believed in omens and thought-transference, and he deemed these dream-robbers to be the astral projection of real personages who happened at those particular moments, no matter where they were in the flesh, to be harboring designs, in the spirit, upon his wealth.So he continued to bleed the unfortunates who crossed his threshold, and at the same time to add to his trouble with every ounce that went into the sack."
"他正在晒着太阳，突然想到一个点子，他激动得猛地跳了起来。他平生最大的乐趣，就是反反复复称金砂；不过有个问题很扫他的兴，他一直没有找到办法解决。他那架称金子的天平很小，最多只能称一磅半，也就是十八盎司，而他的积财差不多是这个限度的三点三倍。他从来没能一次称完所有的金砂，于是总觉得自己无缘看到这种极为启发慧根的全新景象。由于总是无法实现，他简直失去了一半占有金子的乐趣；不，他感到这种令人伤心的障碍不仅使他的财产规模显得小了，而且还在实际上减少了他事实占有的金子。他刚才之所以跳起来，就是因为他猛然间想到了解决的办法。他朝路的两头都仔细地看了看。什么都没有，于是他就进了屋。","As he sat sunning himself, a thought came to Jacob Kent that brought him to his feet with a jerk.The pleasures of life had culminated in the continual weighing and reweighing of his dust; but a shadow had been thrown upon this pleasant avocation, which he had hitherto failed to brush aside.His gold-scales were quite small; in fact, their maximum was a pound and a half,—eighteen ounces,—while his hoard mounted up to something like three and a third times that.He had never been able to weigh it all at one operation, and hence considered himself to have been shut out from a new and most edifying coign of contemplation.Being denied this, half the pleasure of possession had been lost; nay, he felt that this miserable obstacle actually minimized the fact, as it did the strength, of possession.It was the solution of this problem flashing across his mind that had just brought him to his feet.He searched the trail carefully in either direction.There was nothing in sight, so he went inside."
"一转眼的工夫，他就收拾好了桌子，摆上了天平。他在天平一头放上十五盎司重的砝码，在另一头放上等重的金砂。把那头的砝码换成金砂，他就称出了刚好三十盎司的金砂。接下来，他把金砂并到一头，在另一头再装上金砂使天平重新平衡。等到金子都放上去了，他已经是满头大汗了。他欢喜得发抖，那种畅快感简直难以言表。不过，当他把袋子倒空，一粒金砂都不剩的时候，平衡打破了，天平的一头垂下来，落到桌子上。他在另一头加上一便士零五喱的重量，平衡就又恢复了。他昂着头，呆呆地杵在那儿。袋子倒空了，但天平可挖的潜力简直不可估量。照这样弄多少重量都能称出来，从最轻的喱到许多许多磅。财神已经把他热切的手指按到他的心上了。夕阳西沉，阳光照进敞开的大门，笼罩在满载黄金的天平上。这两堆金砂就像埃及艳后铜像上的金色乳房一样，放射出柔和的光晕。时间和空间都不存在了。","In a few seconds he had the table cleared away and the scales set up.On one side he placed the stamped disks to the equivalent of fifteen ounces, and balanced it with dust on the other.Replacing the weights with dust, he then had thirty ounces precisely balanced.These, in turn, he placed together on one side and again balanced with more dust.By this time the gold was exhausted, and he was sweating liberally.He trembled with ecstasy, ravished beyond measure.Nevertheless he dusted the sack thoroughly, to the last least grain, till the balance was overcome and one side of the scales sank to the table.Equilibrium, however, was restored by the addition of a pennyweight and five grains to the opposite side.He stood, head thrown back, transfixed.The sack was empty, but the potentiality of the scales had become immeasurable.Upon them he could weigh any amount, from the tiniest grain to pounds upon pounds.Mammon laid hot fingers on his heart.The sun swung on its westering way till it flashed through the open doorway, full upon the yellow-burdened scales.The precious heaps, like the golden breasts of a bronze Cleopatra, flung back the light in a mellow glow.Time and space were not."
"“俺的老天啊！你可搞了好几磅金子啊，是不？”","“Gawd blime me! but you ’aye the makin’ of several quid there, ’aven’t you?”"
"雅各布·肯特转过身去，同时抓起那支就放在旁边的双筒猎枪。但当他的目光扫到这个闯进来的人的脸上时，他错愕地倒退了好几步。正是那个脸上带着伤疤的人！","Jacob Kent wheeled about, at the same time reaching for his double-barrelled shot-gun, which stood handy.But when his eyes lit on the intruder’s face, he staggered back dizzily.It was the face of the man with the gash!"
"那人好奇地看着他。","The man looked at him curiously."
"“哎，安心啦。”他一边说着，一边挥挥手，责怪肯特大惊小怪。“别觉着俺会害你，俺也不会抢你他妈的这些金砂。”","“Oh, that’s all right,” he said, waving his hand deprecatingly.“You needn’t think as I’ll ’arm you or your blasted dust."
"“你还挺怪的，挺怪的。”他看着肯特满脸是汗、两膝打颤的样子，想了想又说。","“You’re a rum ’un, you are,” he added reflectively, as he watched the sweat pouring from off Kent’s face and the quavering of his knees."
"“你为什么不能张嘴说两句话呢？”他接着说，而肯特正努力地想喘口气。“你这是什么毛病啊？要紧不？”","“W’y don’t you pipe up an’ say somethin’?” he went on, as the other struggled for breath.“Wot’s gone wrong o’ your gaff?Anythink the matter?”"
"“你——你——你这个从哪里弄上的？”肯特终于能憋出几个字了，他抬起颤抖的食指指着对方脸上那条骇人的伤疤问道。","“W—w—where’d you get it?”Kent at last managed to articulate, raising a shaking forefinger to the ghastly scar which seamed the other’s cheek."
"“同船的水手拿主桅上穿绳索的锥子给我扎的。既然你那个疙瘩脑袋顶用了，俺倒想问问，这跟你有啥关系？俺还真得问问了——跟你有啥关系？俺的老天！碍着你什么了？你们这种人啊，还真自以为是。俺还真要问个明白了！”","“Shipmate stove me down with a marlin-spike from the main-royal.An’ now as you ’aye your figger’ead in trim, wot I want to know is, wot’s it to you?That’s wot I want to know—wot’s it to you?Gawd blime me! do it ’urt you?Ain’t it smug enough for the likes o’ you?That’s wot I want to know!”"
"“没有，没有，”肯特一边答道，一边朝一张凳子坐下去，很勉强地笑了下，“我只是问问。”","“No, no,” Kent answered, sinking upon a stool with a sickly grin.“I was just wondering.”"
"“你以前也见过这样的疤？”对方气势汹汹地追问道。","“Did you ever see the like?” the other went on truculently."
"“没见过。”","“No.”"
"“这个疤很漂亮，是吧？”","“Ain’t it a beute?”"
"“是啊。”肯特点点头表示同意，意在奉承一下这位陌生来客，不料他示好的表现反而惹毛了对方。","“Yes.”Kent nodded his head approvingly, intent on humoring this strange visitor, but wholly unprepared for the outburst which was to follow his effort to be agreeable."
"“你个混蛋，挨千刀的狗杂种！”你什么意思？老天爷在俺脸上划了一条这么见不得人的口子，你管这叫漂亮？你这是什么意思，嗯？”","“You blasted, bloomin’, burgoo-eatin’ son-of-a-sea-swab!Wot do you mean, a sayin’ the most onsightly thing Gawd Almighty ever put on the face o’ man is a beute?Wot do you mean, you—”"
"接下来，这个长年在海上摸爬滚打、脾气暴躁的水手骂出了一大串极具东方色彩的下流话，混杂着神灵、魔鬼、妖怪和祖宗十八代；那种野蛮的神气把雅各布·肯特都要吓瘫了。他连忙缩了回去，抬起胳膊抵挡着，好像是怕他动粗。那人见他吓成这副德性，只得暂停了精彩的长篇大骂，转而打雷一般大笑起来。","And thereat this fiery son of the sea broke off into a string of Oriental profanity, mingling gods and devils, lineages and men, metaphors and monsters, with so savage a virility that Jacob Kent was paralyzed.He shrank back, his arms lifted as though to ward off physical violence.So utterly unnerved was he that the other paused in the mid-swing of a gorgeous peroration and burst into thunderous laughter."
"“太阳都快落到路下面去了。”带着伤疤的人笑到快要笑不出来了才说道，“俺觉得，有俺这种模样的人跟你作伴，你应该觉得福分不浅。把屋里的火盆子生起来。俺要解开狗了，喂它们点吃食。老弟，可别吝惜柴火呀；外头的树多得很，你反正有的是工夫，去抡几斧子吧。顺道打桶水来。利索点儿！不然就揍死你！”","“The sun’s knocked the bottom out o’ the trail,” said the Man with the Gash, between departing paroxysms of mirth.“An’ I only ’ope as you’ll appreciate the hoppertunity of consortin’ with a man o’ my mug.Get steam up in that fire-box o’ your’n.I’m goin’ to unrig the dogs an’ grub ’em.An’ don’t be shy o’ the wood, my lad; there’s plenty more where that come from, and it’s you’ve got the time to sling an axe.An’ tote up a bucket o’ water while you’re about it.Lively! or I’ll run you down, so ’elp me!”"
"这可真是闻所未闻。雅各布·肯特居然会去生火、劈柴、打水——像个下人一样服侍客人！吉姆·卡德吉离开道森的时候，他的脑中充满了听人说起的这个道边夏洛克的种种不义行径，一路走来，从许多被肯特盘剥过的人的嘴里，吉姆又听来了更多肯特的罪恶。现在，吉姆·卡德吉，这个像其他水手一样爱开玩笑的人，决心走进这间屋子，挫挫屋主人的锐气。他的计划已经出乎意料地成功了，这一点他当然能觉察出来，他所不知道的是他脸上的疤起了怎样的作用。尽管他不知道，但他能够看到疤所引起的恐惧，因此，他决定好好利用一下这个疤，就像现代商人无情地利用精挑细选的货物发财一样。","Such a thing was unheard of.Jacob Kent was making the fire, chopping wood, packing water—doing menial tasks for a guest!When Jim Cardegee left Dawson, it was with his head filled with the iniquities of this roadside Shylock; and all along the trail his numerous victims had added to the sum of his crimes.Now, Jim Cardegee, with the sailor’s love for a sailor’s joke, had determined, when he pulled into the cabin, to bring its inmate down a peg or so.That he had succeeded beyond expectation he could not help but remark, though he was in the dark as to the part the gash on his cheek had played in it.But while he could not understand, he saw the terror it created, and resolved to exploit it as remorselessly as would any modern trader a choice bit of merchandise."
"“你这样要是都不算手脚麻利，活该叫俺眼睛瞎掉！”主人在忙里忙外，卡德吉歪着头，恭维了一句，“你根本用不着去克朗代克淘金。你天生就是一个酒馆老板。我常常听育空河上的人说起你，但我真没料到你人居然这么好。”","“Strike me blind, but you’re a ’ustler,” he said admiringly, his head cocked to one side, as his host bustled about.“You never ’ort to ’ave gone Klondiking.It’s the keeper of a pub’ you was laid out for.An’ it’s often as I ’ave ’eard the lads up an’ down the river speak o’ you, but I ’adn’t no idea you was so jolly nice.”"
"雅各布·肯特恨不得一枪打死他，但是那个伤疤的魔力太强了。这就是那个带着伤疤的人，那个经常在心里抢夺他财物的人。他就是那个灵魂闯进他梦里的人的肉身，那个老是在他的贮藏物上打主意的人；因此——他只能得出这个结论了——这个带着伤疤的人亲自来抢他的东西了。还有那个伤疤！除非他的心跳停止，否则他无法不去看那个疤。他竭力把目光移开，但是眼睛还是不由自主地要回到那个伤疤上，就像指南针一定要指向北极一样。","Jacob Kent experienced a tremendous yearning to try his shotgun on him, but the fascination of the gash was too potent.This was the real Man with the Gash, the man who had so often robbed him in the spirit.This, then, was the embodied entity of the being whose astral form had been projected into his dreams, the man who had so frequently harbored designs against his hoard; hence—there could be no other conclusion—this Man with the Gash had now come in the flesh to dispossess him.And that gash!He could no more keep his eyes from it than stop the beating of his heart.Try as he would, they wandered back to that one point as inevitably as the needle to the pole."
"“它碍着你什么了？”吉姆·卡德吉猛然一声大喝，因为他在铺毯子的时候，偶然瞥见肯特正目不转睛地盯着他，“我看，你倒不如收拾下铺盖，灭了火，钻进被窝里去，免得这个疤吓着你。好好弄，你这个混蛋，要不然俺一拳捶你鼻子上！”","“Do it ’urt you?”Jim Cardegee thundered suddenly, looking up from the spreading of his blankets and encountering the rapt gaze of the other.“It strikes me as ’ow it ’ud be the proper thing for you to draw your jib, douse the glim, an’ turn in, seein’ as ’ow it worrits you.Jes’ lay to that, you swab, or so ’elp me I’ll take a pull on your peak-purchases!”"
"肯特吓坏了，连吹了三次才吹灭油灯。他连鹿皮靴都没脱，就钻进毯子里去了。水手睡在硬邦邦的地板上，不一会儿就鼾声如雷了；而肯特虽然躺着，眼睛却盯着一片漆黑，手放在猎枪上，决心整夜都不合眼。他一直没找着机会将他的五磅金子藏好，而金子就在他床头的火药匣子里。虽然努力挺着，他最后还是睡过去了，而那些金砂仍然沉重地压在他的心上。如果他不是怀着这样的心情不经意睡过去，他的梦游症就不会发作，第二天吉姆·卡德吉也不会拿着淘金盘收获一笔横财。","Kent was so nervous that it took three puffs to blow out the slush-lamp, and he crawled into his blankets without even removing his moccasins.The sailor was soon snoring lustily from his hard bed on the floor, but Kent lay staring up into the blackness, one hand on the shotgun, resolved not to close his eyes the whole night.He had not had an opportunity to secrete his five pounds of gold, and it lay in the ammunition box at the head of his bunk.But, try as he would, he at last dozed off with the weight of his dust heavy on his soul.Had he not inadvertently fallen asleep with his mind in such condition, the somnambulic demon would not have been invoked, nor would Jim Cardegee have gone mining next day with a dish-pan."
"炉火徒劳地挣扎了许久，终于还是熄灭了。寒气从长着苔藓的木头缝里渗进来，把屋里的空气变得冰凉。外面的狗也不叫了，都蜷缩在雪地里，梦想着堆满鲑鱼的天堂，那里没有赶狗拉雪橇的人，也没有各种监督它们的人。屋子里，水手睡得像根木头，屋主人却做着各种怪梦，不停地翻来翻去。午夜临近的时候，他突然掀开毯子，站了起来。神奇的是，他接下来一连干了好多事，却连一根火柴都没划过。他没有睁眼，或许是因为屋子里黑，或许是因为他怕看见客人脸上那道吓人的伤疤。总之，不管怎么说，事实就是：他闭着眼睛打开了火药匣子，把猎枪的枪膛灌得满满当当，一粒火药粉末都没有剩下。然后他用两重塞子塞好枪，收拾妥当，又回去睡觉了。","The fire fought a losing battle, and at last died away, while the frost penetrated the mossy chinks between the logs and chilled the inner atmosphere.The dogs outside ceased their howling, and, curled up in the snow, dreamed of salmon-stocked heavens where dog-drivers and kindred task-masters were not.Within, the sailor lay like a log, while his host tossed restlessly about, the victim of strange fantasies.As midnight drew near he suddenly threw off the blankets and got up.It was remarkable that he could do what he then did without ever striking a light.Perhaps it was because of the darkness that he kept his eyes shut, and perhaps it was for fear he would see the terrible gash on the cheek of his visitor; but, be this as it may, it is a fact that, unseeing, he opened his ammunition box, put a heavy charge into the muzzle of the shotgun without spilling a particle, rammed it down with double wads, and then put everything away and got back into bed."
"铁灰色的曙光刚刚照到糊着羊皮纸的窗户，雅各布·肯特就醒了。他用胳膊肘把身体撑起来，打开火药匣子的盖子，往里边瞅了一眼。考虑到他是如此神经质的人，这一眼不管他看到了什么，或是没看到什么，都对他产生了极为特殊的影响。他瞧了一眼睡在地板上的水手，轻轻合上盖子，又重新躺好。他的脸上显出少有的冷静来。没有哪块肌肉有抖动。一点都没有激动或者狂躁的表现。他躺了很久，也想了很久；等他再次起身四处走动的时候，他表现得很镇静，既不慌张，也没有弄出声响。","Just as daylight laid its steel-gray fingers on the parchment window, Jacob Kent awoke.Turning on his elbow, he raised the lid and peered into the ammunition box.Whatever he saw, or whatever he did not see, exercised a very peculiar effect upon him, considering his neurotic temperament.He glanced at the sleeping man on the floor, let the lid down gently, and rolled over on his back.It was an unwonted calm that rested on his face.Not a muscle quivered.There was not the least sign of excitement or perturbation.He lay there a long while, thinking, and when he got up and began to move about, it was in a cool, collected manner, without noise and without hurry."
"碰巧吉姆·卡德吉的头正上方的房梁上，有一根厚重的木桩。雅各布·肯特轻手轻脚地干起来，他把一根半英寸粗的马尼拉绳抛过木桩，然后把绳子两端都拉到地上。他把一端系在自己腰上，把另一端绕成一个活绳套。接着他扣下扳机，把猎枪放在够得着的距离，靠在许多麋鹿皮带子旁边。他定了定神，特意望了望那条伤疤，把绳套圈在那个熟睡的人的脖子上，然后向后倾倒，用自己的体重拉紧绳子，同时抓起枪，瞄准了那个瓮中之鳖。","It happened that a heavy wooden peg had been driven into the ridge-pole just above Jim Cardegee’s head.Jacob Kent, working softly, ran a piece of half-inch manila over it, bringing both ends to the ground.One end he tied about his waist, and in the other he rove a running noose.Then he cocked his shotgun and laid it within reach, by the side of numerous moose-hide thongs.By an effort of will he bore the sight of the scar, slipped the noose over the sleeper’s head, and drew it taut by throwing back on his weight, at the same time seizing the gun and bringing it to bear."
"吉姆·卡德吉惊醒了，憋得喘不过气来，迷惑地看着对准他的双筒猎枪。","Jim Cardegee awoke, choking, bewildered, staring down the twin wells of steel."
"“东西在哪儿？”肯特发问了，同时松开了绳子。","“Where is it?”Kent asked, at the same time slacking on the rope."
"“你混蛋——咳——”","“You blasted—ugh—”"
"肯特只是后仰了一下，就让对方出不了气。","Kent merely threw back his weight, shutting off the other’s wind."
"“你个挨千刀——呃——呃——”","“Bloomin’—Bur—ugh—”"
"“东西在哪儿？”肯特又问道。","“Where is it?”Kent repeated."
"“啥东西？”卡德吉喘上一口气，赶忙问道。","“Wot?”Cardegee asked, as soon as he had caught his breath."
"“金砂。”","“The gold-dust.”"
"“啥金砂？”莫名其妙的水手问道。","“Wot gold-dust?” the perplexed sailor demanded."
"“你最清楚不过了——我的金砂。”","“You know well enough,—mine.”"
"“俺见都没有见过。你把俺当什么了？保险柜？跟俺有啥关系？”","“Ain’t seen nothink of it.Wot do ye take me for?A safe-deposit?Wot ’ave I got to do with it, any’ow?”"
"“你可能知道，可能不知道，反正我要勒得你知道为止。你的手胆敢动一动，我就轰烂你的脑袋！”","“Mebbe you know, and mebbe you don’t know, but anyway, I’m going to stop your breath till you do know.And if you lift a hand, I’ll blow your head off!”"
"“天哪！”绳子收紧了，卡德吉大叫起来。","“Vast heavin’!”Cardegee roared, as the rope tightened."
"后来，肯特放松了一下，水手就装作受迫的样子，扭动着脖子，设法把绳套弄松了一些，让它正好勒住自己的下巴。","Kent eased away a moment, and the sailor, wriggling his neck as though from the pressure, managed to loosen the noose a bit and work it up so the point of contact was just under the chin."
"“现在如何？”肯特问道，指望他吐出实话。","“Well?”Kent questioned, expecting the disclosure."
"但是卡德吉只是笑了笑。“你就这么绞死俺吧，你个就知道洗锅子的老不死！”","But Cardegee grinned.“Go ahead with your ’angin’, you bloomin’ old pot-wolloper!”"
"如同水手预想的那样，这出悲剧演成了闹剧。两人当中卡德吉更重，所以肯特即使把身子倾到底，也无法将他完全吊离地面。肯特使出最大的劲儿了，水手的脚还是拖在地上，支撑着他一部分重量。其余的就靠勒在他下巴上的绳子来支撑。一看无法把他完全吊起来，肯特就使劲拉，决计慢慢让他窒息，或者逼他说出把金子藏到什么地方去了。但是这个有伤疤的人就是勒不死。五分钟，十分钟，十五分钟过去了；最后，肯特无计可施，只好把俘虏给放下来。","Then, as the sailor had anticipated, the tragedy became a farce.Cardegee being the heavier of the two, Kent, throwing his body backward and down, could not lift him clear of the ground.Strain and strive to the uttermost, the sailor’s feet still stuck to the floor and sustained a part of his weight.The remaining portion was supported by the point of contact just under his chin.Failing to swing him clear, Kent clung on, resolved to slowly throttle him or force him to tell what he had done with the hoard.But the Man with the Gash would not throttle.Five, ten, fifteen minutes passed, and at the end of that time, in despair, Kent let his prisoner down."
"“好吧，”卡德吉擦着脸上的汗，说道，“你要不想绞死俺，你就给俺吃枪子儿吧。有的人生来就是吊不死的。”","“Well,” he remarked, wiping away the sweat, “if you won’t hang you’ll shoot.Some men wasn’t born to be hanged, anyway.”"
"“瞧你把地板搞得一团糟。”卡德吉在争取时间，“你听着，俺来告诉你该咋办；俺们两人合计合计，研究一下。你丢了金砂。你说俺知道在哪儿，俺说不知道。俺们想想，想出个辙来……”","“An’ it’s a pretty mess as you’ll make o’ this ’ere cabin floor.”Cardegee was fighting for time.“Now, look ’ere, I’ll tell you wot we do; we’ll lay our ’eads ‘longside an’ reason together.You’ve lost some dust.You say as ’ow I know, an’ I say as ’ow I don’t.Let’s get a hobservation an’ shape a course—”"
"“天哪！”肯特突然插了进来，挖苦地模仿着对方的声调，“这个事儿全由我来想，你只能看着；你要胆敢做点别的，我一定在你身上打穿一个洞！”","“Vast heavin’!”Kent dashed in, maliciously imitating the other’s enunciation.“I’m going to shape all the courses of this shebang, and you observe; and if you do anything more, I’ll bore you as sure as Moses!”"
"“求你看在我上有老娘的份上……”","“For the sake of my mother—”"
"“她要疼你的话，就让上帝可怜可怜她吧。哼！你敢动？”他把冰冷的枪口顶在对方的额头上，扼杀了对方的敌意之举。“立马躺好！你要有一根毛立起来，就叫你完蛋。”","“Whom God have mercy upon if she loves you.Ah!Would you?”He frustrated a hostile move on the part of the other by pressing the cold muzzle against his forehead.“Lay quiet, now!If you lift as much as a hair, you’ll get it.”"
"肯特始终让扳机处于触手可及的位置，保持这个姿势要捆好水手可不容易；不过，他终究是纺织工出身，几分钟之内就把水手手脚捆严实了。然后他把水手拖出来，放到屋子旁边，这样他可以一边眺望育空河，一边看着太阳升上最高点。","It was rather an awkward task, with the trigger of the gun always within pulling distance of the finger; but Kent was a weaver, and in a few minutes had the sailor tied hand and foot.Then he dragged him without and laid him by the side of the cabin, where he could overlook the river and watch the sun climb to the meridian."
"“我会把你留到中午，然后……”","“Now I’ll give you till noon, and then—”"
"“怎样？”","“Wot?”"
"“然后送你回老家。不过你要是肯说出来呢，我就让你活着，把你交给下一队路过的骑警。”","“You’ll be hitting the brimstone trail.But if you speak up, I’ll keep you till the next bunch of mounted police come by.”"
"“噢，俺的老天啊，还有这样的事儿！俺就像只无辜的羔羊，啥事儿也没干，而你平白无故就发疯，非要弄死俺。你个天杀的老贼！你……”","“Well, Gawd blime me, if this ain’t a go!’Ere I be, innercent as a lamb, an’ ’ere you be, lost all o’ your top ’amper an’ out o’ your reckonin’, run me foul an’ goin’ to rake me into ’ell-fire.You bloomin’ old pirut!You—”"
"吉姆·卡德吉止不住破口大骂起来，这次比以前还要出彩。雅各布·肯特搬出来一张凳子，以便可以坐下来舒舒服服地听他骂。后来，水手把所有想得出来的骂人的话都使完了，他安静下来，开始苦苦思索。他的眼睛不断地量着太阳划过东方天际的轨迹，觉得它上升得太快了。那些狗，因为很久没给套上雪橇，也觉得奇怪，都围拢到水手身边。这些畜生也看出了他孤立无援。虽然不知道怎么回事，但是它们觉得一定出了什么差错；它们跑来跑去，悲切地嗥叫着，表达一份同情。","Jim Cardegee loosed the strings of his profanity and fairly outdid himself.Jacob Kent brought out a stool that he might enjoy it in comfort.Having exhausted all the possible combinations of his vocabulary, the sailor quieted down to hard thinking, his eyes constantly gauging the progress of the sun, which tore up the eastern slope of the heavens with unseemly haste.His dogs, surprised that they had not long since been put to harness, crowded around him.His helplessness appealed to the brutes.They felt that something was wrong, though they knew not what, and they crowded about, howling their mournful sympathy."
"“啐！走开走开，你们这些鬼印第安狗！”他呵斥道，打算扭几下身子，把它们赶开。这时他发现自己是在一个斜坡的边缘挣扎。狗一散开，他就开始想：斜坡就在那儿，他看不到，坡的那面是什么样的呢？没过多一会儿他就得出了一个正确的结论。从道理上讲，他推想，人都很懒。他本人就是，只有非做不可的才去做。他要造房子，一定得在房顶上铺些泥。照此推测，他一定会就近取些泥，除非绝对必要，否则不会跑远了，这样是说得通的。因此，他应该躺在一个坑边上，雅各布·肯特从这里挖泥铺他的房顶，才有了这个坑。他想，这一点如果好好利用一下，说不准可以拖延点时间。接着，他开始在绑着他的鹿皮绳上打主意。他的双手反绑在背后，压在雪地上，已经沾湿了。他知道，生皮沾水的话就会拉长；于是，他表面上没有明显的动作，暗中在努力把绳子挣开。","“Chook!Mush-on! you Siwashes!” he cried, attempting, in a vermicular way, to kick at them, and discovering himself to be tottering on the edge of a declivity.As soon as the animals had scattered, he devoted himself to the significance of that declivity which he felt to be there but could not see.Nor was he long in arriving at a correct conclusion.In the nature of things, he figured, man is lazy.He does no more than he has to.When he builds a cabin he must put dirt on the roof.From these premises it was logical that he should carry that dirt no further than was absolutely necessary.Therefore, he lay upon the edge of the hole from which the dirt had been taken to roof Jacob Kent’s cabin.This knowledge, properly utilized, might prolong things, he thought; and he then turned his attention to the moose-hide thongs which bound him.His hands were tied behind him, and pressing against the snow, they were wet with the contact.This moistening of the raw-hide he knew would tend to make it stretch, and, without apparent effort, he endeavored to stretch it more and more."
"他十分期盼地望着那条雪上通路；在六十英里站的方向有个黑点在一片白茫茫的冰封大地上闪现了一下，他赶紧看了看太阳。太阳已经快到天顶了。他看到那个黑点有时爬上冰峰，有时沉入冰谷；不过他只敢偷偷瞄几眼，害怕明目张胆地看会引起对手的怀疑。有一次，雅各布·肯特站了起来，很用心地盯着那条路看，卡德吉吓坏了；幸亏狗拉雪橇驶过的那段路有冰层挡着，没有让肯特瞧见，危险才算过去。","He watched the trail hungrily, and when in the direction of Sixty Mile a dark speck appeared for a moment against the white background of an ice-jam, he cast an anxious eye at the sun.It had climbed nearly to the zenith.Now and again he caught the black speck clearing the hills of ice and sinking into the intervening hollows; but he dared not permit himself more than the most cursory glances for fear of rousing his enemy’s suspicion.Once, when Jacob Kent rose to his feet and searched the trail with care, Cardegee was frightened, but the dog-sled had struck a piece of trail running parallel with a jam, and remained out of sight till the danger was past."
"“你做这种孽，迟早要给绞死，”卡德吉威胁到，意在引起对方的注意。“你会在地狱里慢慢烂掉，等着瞧吧。”","“I’ll see you ’ung for this,” Cardegee threatened, attempting to draw the other’s attention.“An’ you’ll rot in ’ell, jes’ you see if you don’t."
"“哎，”停了一下，他又喊道，“你相信鬼吗？”肯特突然吃了一惊，这使得他觉得更有把握了，他就接着说下去：“一个人要是说话不算话，鬼就有权缠着他；没有敲八下钟，你就不能打死俺——俺的意思是十二点前，你不能开枪——你办得到不？要是你办不到，俺做鬼也不会放过你。听见了没？你就算提前了一分钟、一秒钟，俺都不会放过你，记住，俺不会放过你！”","“I say,” he cried, after another pause; “d’ye b’lieve in ghosts?”Kent’s sudden start made him sure of his ground, and he went on: “Now a ghost ’as the right to ’aunt a man wot don’t do wot he says; and you can’t shuffle me off till eight bells—wot I mean is twelve o’clock—can you?‘Cos if you do, it’ll ’appen as ’ow I’ll ’aunt you.D’ye ’ear?A minute, a second too quick, an’ I’ll ’aunt you, so ’elp me, I will!”"
"雅各布·肯特看上去将信将疑，但就是不接话。","Jacob Kent looked dubious, but declined to talk."
"“你的表好使不？这儿经度是多少？你怎么知道你的时间准不准？”卡德吉还在喋喋不休，枉自寄希望于从刽子手那里赢得几分钟的时间。“你用的是兵营时间还是公司时间？要是你在敲钟之前就开枪，俺可不会善罢甘休。我这是老实地警告你。俺会回来的。要是你没有表，你咋知道什么时间了？俺就想问这个——你咋知道呢？”","“’Ow’s your chronometer?Wot’s your longitude?’Ow do you know as your time’s correct?”Cardegee persisted, vainly hoping to beat his executioner out of a few minutes.“Is it Barrack’s time you ‘ave, or is it the Company time?‘Cos if you do it before the stroke o’ the bell, I’ll not rest.I give you fair warnin’.I’ll come back.An’ if you ’aven’t the time, ’ow will you know?That’s wot I want—’ow will you tell?”"
"“我会准时送你上路的，”肯特答道，“我这儿有座日晷。”","“I’ll send you off all right,” Kent replied.“Got a sun-dial here.”"
"“不行的。那根针有三十二度的偏差。”","“No good.Thirty-two degrees variation o’ the needle.”"
"“都校准过了。”","“Stakes are all set.”"
"“你怎么校准的？拿罗盘？”","“’Ow did you set ’em?Compass?”"
"“不，我拿北极星校的。”","“No; lined them up with the North Star.”"
"“你确定？”","“Sure?”"
"“确定。”","“Sure.”"
"卡德吉哼了一声，偷偷朝路上瞄了一眼。那驾雪橇正在爬坡，离这里大概有一英里远，拉雪橇的狗都撒开了腿，轻快地飞奔着。","Cardegee groaned, then stole a glance at the trail.The sled was just clearing a rise, barely a mile away, and the dogs were in full lope, running lightly."
"“影子离那条线还有多远？”","“’Ow close is the shadows to the line?”"
"肯特走到那个原始的日晷那里，仔细看着。在仔细测量之后，他说：“还有三英寸。”","Kent walked to the primitive timepiece and studied it.“Three inches,” he announced, after a careful survey."
"“嗨，开枪之前，你得喊出来‘敲八下’，行不行？”","“Say, jes’ sing out ‘eight bells’ afore you pull the gun, will you?”"
"肯特同意了，然后两人又没话说了。拴住卡德吉手腕的绳子正在慢慢松开，他已经快把手挣脱出来了。","Kent agreed, and they lapsed into silence.The thongs about Cardegee’s wrists were slowly stretching, and he had begun to work them over his hands."
"“嗨，影子还有多远？”","“Say, ’ow close is the shadows?”"
"“一英寸。”","“One inch.”"
"水手轻轻地扭动着，以便到了开枪的时刻，他可以翻滚下去；他已经褪下了手上的第一圈绳子。","The sailor wriggled slightly to assure himself that he would topple over at the right moment, and slipped the first turn over his hands."
"“还剩多远？”","“’Ow close?”"
"“半英寸。”这时候，肯特听到了雪橇滑过来的刺耳的嘎吱声，他抬眼向路上望去。雪橇上的人平躺着，狗拉着雪橇，径直向这间木屋奔来。肯特急忙转身，把枪举上肩头。","“Half an inch.”Just then Kent heard the jarring churn of the runners and turned his eyes to the trail.The driver was lying flat on the sled and the dogs swinging down the straight stretch to the cabin.Kent whirled back, bringing his rifle to shoulder."
"“还没敲八下呢！”卡德吉警告他说，“我不会放过你的，一定不会的！”","“It ain’t eight bells yet!”Cardegee expostulated.“I’ll ’aunt you, sure!”"
"雅各布·肯特迟疑了一下。他站在日晷旁边，离他要射杀的人不过十步的距离。雪橇上的人一定也发现有蹊跷的事要发生，因为他跪着立了起来，拿鞭子狠命招呼那些狗。","Jacob Kent faltered.He was standing by the sun-dial, perhaps ten paces from his victim.The man on the sled must have seen that something unusual was taking place, for he had risen to his knees, his whip singing viciously among the dogs."
"影子已经对齐了那条线。肯特已经瞄准了。","The shadows swept into line.Kent looked along the sights."
"“预备！”他严肃地命令道，“敲八……”","“Make ready!” he commanded solemnly.“Eight b—”"
"转瞬之间，卡德吉已经向后滚到坑里去了。肯特没有开火，跑到了坑边上。轰！水手刚站起来，枪就正对着他的脸炸响了。但是枪口没有冒烟，倒是从靠近枪托的枪筒一侧迸发出来一片火光，然后雅各布·肯特倒下去了。狗拉着雪橇冲到岸上，从他的尸体上压了过去；吉姆·卡德吉把手解脱出来，从坑里爬出来，这时候赶雪橇的人刚好也跳了下来。","But just a fraction of a second too soon, Cardegee rolled backward into the hole.Kent held his fire and ran to the edge.Bang!The gun exploded full in the sailor’s face as he rose to his feet.But no smoke came from the muzzle; instead, a sheet of flame burst from the side of the barrel near its butt, and Jacob Kent went down.The dogs dashed up the bank, dragging the sled over his body, and the driver sprang off as Jim Cardegee freed his hands and drew himself from the hole."
"“吉姆！”新到的人认出了他。“出什么事了？”","“Jim!”The new-comer recognized him.“What’s the matter?”"
"“出什么事儿？啊，没事儿。俺不过搞点小把戏，动动筋骨。出什么事儿，你个该杀的呆子？你还问俺出什么事儿？给俺松开，俺就告诉你。快点儿，要不然就拿你来擦甲板！”","“Wot’s the matter?Oh, nothink at all.It jest ’appens as I do little things like this for my ’ealth.Wot’s the matter, you bloomin’ idjit?Wot’s the matter, eh?Cast me loose or I’ll show you wot!’Urry up, or I’ll ’olystone the decks with you!”"
"“呼！”那人用小刀帮他割绳子，他得以出了一口气。“怎么回事儿？俺还想知道呢。你来说说，是怎么回事儿？嗯？”","“Huh!” he added, as the other went to work with his sheath-knife.“Wot’s the matter?I want to know.Jes’ tell me that, will you, wot’s the matter?Hey?”"
"他们把肯特翻过来的时候，他已经完全死了。那支笨重的枪口装填的老式枪，就在他旁边。铁的枪筒和木头的枪身已经分开了。枪筒右侧靠近枪托的地方有一条几英吋长的裂缝，裂口向外翻。水手好奇地把枪拾了起来。闪闪发光的金砂从裂口不断地流了出来。吉姆·卡德吉这才搞清楚这件事的真相。","Kent was quite dead when they rolled him over.The gun, an old-fashioned, heavy-weighted muzzle-loader, lay near him.Steel and wood had parted company.Near the butt of the right-hand barrel, with lips pressed outward, gaped a fissure several inches in length.The sailor picked it up, curiously.A glittering stream of yellow dust ran out through the crack.The facts of the case dawned upon Jim Cardegee."
"“真是死也想不到！”他吼道，“实在想不到！这就是那些该死的金砂！我真该死；查理，赶紧去拿个淘金盘，要不你也该死！”","“Strike me standin’!” he roared; “’ere’s a go!’Ere’s ’is bloomin’ dust!Gawd blime me, an’ you, too, Charley, if you don’t run an’ get the dish-pan!”"
