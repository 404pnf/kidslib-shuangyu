"作者：欧·亨利","by O. Henry"
"巴列路纳封地的迈克尔王子正坐在公园里他最爱的那张长椅上。九月夜晚的丝丝清凉像珍稀又滋补的美酒使他充满了活力。公园里的长椅上没有多少人，因为公园里闲荡的人们由于血液停滞，稍稍一觉察出初秋的凉意便马上逃回家里去了。月光清晰地映出东面那与四方广场接壤的一片楼群的屋顶轮廓。孩子们在水花飞溅的喷泉旁笑闹嬉戏。阴暗处，半人半羊的农牧神和林木女神正互相求爱，全然不顾世俗目光的注视。手风琴悠扬而又低沉的歌声从一条小巷子里飘来，这架琴是舞台木匠恩赐予我们的夜莺。在小公园漂亮的围栏外，有轨电车像猫一样发出呼噜声，高架火车像寻觅领地的老虎和狮子，轰隆隆地呼啸而过。在一幢旧式公共建筑的塔顶上有一座照明灯，它又大又圆的钟盘在树梢上方闪闪发光。","Prince Michael, of the Electorate of Valleluna, sat on his favourite bench in the park.The coolness of the September night quickened the life in him like a rare, tonic wine.The benches were not filled; for park loungers, with their stagnant blood, are prompt to detect and fly home from the crispness of early autumn.The moon was just clearing the roofs of the range of dwellings that bounded the quadrangle on the east.Children laughed and played about the fine-sprayed fountain.In the shadowed spots fauns and hamadryads wooed, unconscious of the gaze of mortal eyes.A hand organ—Philomel by the grace of our stage carpenter—fluted and droned in a side street.Around the enchanted boundaries of the little park street cars spat and mewed and the stilted trains roared like tigers and lions prowling for a place to enter.And above the trees shone the great, round, shining face of an illuminated clock in the tower of an antique public building."
"迈克尔王子的鞋子破旧不堪，就连最细致的补鞋匠也没法修好。对于他的衣服，收破烂的人也不愿意讨价还价。他脸上两周未刮的胡茬子显出灰色、棕色、红色和黄绿色——好像是由音乐喜剧队里所有人的胡子拼凑而成的。没有一个有钱人会戴一顶像他那样的破帽子。","Prince Michael’s shoes were wrecked far beyond the skill of the carefullest cobbler.The ragman would have declined any negotiations concerning his clothes.The two weeks’ stubble on his face was grey and brown and red and greenish yellow—as if it had been made up from individual contributions from the chorus of a musical comedy.No man existed who had money enough to wear so bad a hat as his."
"迈克尔王子坐在他最爱的长椅上笑了起来。想来有趣，如果他愿意的话，他有足够的钱买下面前任何一幢结构紧凑、气势宏伟、窗明几净的宅邸。他拥有的黄金、马车、珠宝、艺术珍品、庄园和地产足以和曼哈顿这座尊贵之城里的任何一个富豪相媲美，而这只是他庞大家产的一小部分而已。他能够和至高无上的君王们同席而坐。社交界、艺术界、精英团体的邀请；受人崇敬、被人效仿；美人献上的敬仰，高位者授予的荣耀，智者给予的赞美；逢迎、尊敬、信任、快乐、名望——所有这些人生的蜜糖都在世界这个蜂巢里等待着巴列路纳封地的迈克尔王子，任他随时享用。但是，他却选择穿着破旧邋遢的衣服坐在公园的长椅上。因为他尝过生命之树的果实后，满嘴苦涩，于是他暂时离开伊甸园，到不见刀戈、充满生机的尘世间寻找快乐。","Prince Michael sat on his favourite bench and smiled.It was a diverting thought to him that he was wealthy enough to buy every one of those close-ranged, bulky, window-lit mansions that faced him, if he chose.He could have matched gold, equipages, jewels, art treasures, estates and acres with any Croesus in this proud city of Manhattan, and scarcely have entered upon the bulk of his holdings.He could have sat at table with reigning sovereigns.The social world, the world of art, the fellowship of the elect, adulation, imitation, the homage of the fairest, honours from the highest, praise from the wisest, flattery, esteem, credit, pleasure, fame—all the honey of life was waiting in the comb in the hive of the world for Prince Michael, of the Electorate of Valleluna, whenever he might choose to take it.But his choice was to sit in rags and dinginess on a bench in a park.For he had tasted of the fruit of the tree of life, and, finding it bitter in his mouth, had stepped out of Eden for a time to seek distraction close to the unarmoured, beating heart of the world."
"当他扬起藏在五彩胡茬子下的嘴角微笑时，这些思绪如梦般萦绕在迈克尔王子的心头。他天天这样闲荡着，打扮得像公园里最潦倒的乞丐，但是他热衷于研究人性。他发现无私奉献、助人利他，比拥有财富、地位和人生所有的世俗享乐更能使他快乐。减轻别人的痛苦，救助那些需要救助并且值得救助的人，用聪明理智的办法把超乎想象、令人目眩且具有皇家威仪的礼物赠予不幸的人，使之心花怒放，这些是他主要的慰藉和满足。","These thoughts strayed dreamily through the mind of Prince Michael, as he smiled under the stubble of his polychromatic beard.Lounging thus, clad as the poorest of mendicants in the parks, he loved to study humanity.He found in altruism more pleasure than his riches, his station and all the grosser sweets of life had given him.It was his chief solace and satisfaction to alleviate individual distress, to confer favours upon worthy ones who had need of succour, to dazzle unfortunates by unexpected and bewildering gifts of truly royal magnificence, bestowed, however, with wisdom and judiciousness."
"当迈克尔王子的目光落到塔楼上大时钟那发光的钟盘上时，他那大公无私的笑脸上微微露出轻蔑的神情。王子心胸宽广；可每每想到这些专制的计时器对世人的压制，他都不禁摇起头来。人们受制于时钟上走动的小小金属指针，匆忙恐惧地来来往往，这一直使他感到悲哀。","And as Prince Michael’s eye rested upon the glowing face of the great clock in the tower, his smile, altruistic as it was, became slightly tinged with contempt.Big thoughts were the Prince’s; and it was always with a shake of his head that he considered the subjugation of the world to the arbitrary measures of Time.The comings and goings of people in hurry and dread, controlled by the little metal moving hands of a clock, always made him sad."
"不久，一位穿着晚礼服的年轻人走了过来，坐在王子旁边的第三张长椅上。他紧张而又急促地抽了半个小时的雪茄，然后抬头仰望树梢上方那照明灯的钟盘。显然，他看起来局促不安，带着些许悲伤，王子注意到他之所以这样在某种程度上与计时器上缓慢移动的指针有关。","By and by came a young man in evening clothes and sat upon the third bench from the Prince.For half an hour he smoked cigars with nervous haste, and then he fell to watching the face of the illuminated clock above the trees.His perturbation was evident, and the Prince noted, in sorrow, that its cause was connected, in some manner, with the slowly moving hands of the timepiece."
"王子殿下站了起来，走到年轻人的长椅旁。","His Highness arose and went to the young man’s bench."
"“抱歉打扰你了，”他说，“不过我看得出来，你有些烦心事。恕我冒昧，我是迈克尔王子，巴列路纳封地的王位继承人。我现在是微服出行，当然，你可以从我的打扮上看出来。我非常乐意向那些我认为值得帮助的人提供帮助。也许，你的烦心事在我们俩的共同努力下可以更容易得到解决。”","“I beg your pardon for addressing you,” he said, “but I perceive that you are disturbed in mind.If it may serve to mitigate the liberty I have taken I will add that I am Prince Michael, heir to the throne of the Electorate of Valleluna.I appear incognito, of course, as you may gather from my appearance.It is a fancy of mine to render aid to others whom I think worthy of it.Perhaps the matter that seems to distress you is one that would more readily yield to our mutual efforts.”"
"年轻人眼睛一亮，抬起头看着王子。他的眼中虽然闪烁着希望的光亮，但他那充满困惑的“川”字型眉毛并没有舒展开来。他笑了起来，可即使是笑，他的眉头也依然紧锁。不过，他愿意花点儿时间解解闷。","The young man looked up brightly at the Prince.Brightly, but the perpendicular line of perplexity between his brows was not smoothed away.He laughed, and even then it did not.But he accepted the momentary diversion."
"“很高兴见到您，王子殿下，”他好脾气地说道，“是的，要我说您就是微服出行,好吧。感谢您提供帮助——不过我觉得您插手相助起不了什么作用。这是件私事儿，您知道的——不过还是谢谢您。”","“Glad to meet you, Prince,” he said, good humouredly.“Yes, I’d say you were incog, all right.Thanks for your offer of assistance—but I don’t see where your butting-in would help things any.It’s a kind of private affair, you know—but thanks all the same.”"
"迈克尔王子在年轻人身边坐了下来。他经常遭到拒绝，但从来不是以被侮辱的方式。他彬彬有礼的言谈举止避免了那种情况的发生。","Prince Michael sat at the young man’s side.He was often rebuffed but never offensively.His courteous manner and words forbade that."
"“时钟，”王子说，“是人类脚上的枷锁。我注意到你一直在看那座时钟。它的钟盘是暴君的脸孔，钟盘上的数字和彩票上的数字一样虚伪；它的指针是赌场骗子的双手，这双手和你立赌约，让你倾家荡产。我恳求你挣脱这屈辱的枷锁，停止用这无情的铜铁计时器来安排你的生活。”","“Clocks,” said the Prince, “are shackles on the feet of mankind.I have observed you looking persistently at that clock.Its face is that of a tyrant, its numbers are false as those on a lottery ticket; its hands are those of a bunco steerer, who makes an appointment with you to your ruin.Let me entreat you to throw off its humiliating bonds and to cease to order your affairs by that insensate monitor of brass and steel.”"
"“我很少这样，”年轻人说，“不穿正式体面的衣服时，我都会带着一块表。”","“I don’t usually,” said the young man.“I carry a watch except when I’ve got my radiant rags on.”"
"“我了解人性，就像我了解草木一样，”王子很庄重地说道，“我是哲学硕士和文科学士，我拥有取之不尽、用之不竭的财富。几乎没有什么大不幸是我不能减轻或消除的。我从你的脸上看到了诚实、高贵，还有苦恼。我恳请你接受我的忠告或者帮助。不要从我的外表判断我消除你烦恼的能力，这样会掩盖我在你脸上看到的那份智慧。”","“I know human nature as I do the trees and grass,” said the Prince, with earnest dignity.“I am a master of philosophy, a graduate in art, and I hold the purse of a Fortunatus.There are few mortal misfortunes that I cannot alleviate or overcome.I have read your countenance, and found in it honesty and nobility as well as distress.I beg of you to accept my advice or aid.Do not belie the intelligence I see in your face by judging from my appearance of my ability to defeat your troubles.”"
"年轻人又看了一眼时钟，阴郁地皱起眉。他的目光离开发光的计时器后，他就目不转睛地看着他座位对面那排楼房中的一幢四层红砖房。窗帘都是拉上的，很多屋子的灯光透过窗帘微弱地闪烁着。","The young man glanced at the clock again and frowned darkly.When his gaze strayed from the glowing horologe of time it rested intently upon a four-story red brick house in the row of dwellings opposite to where he sat.The shades were drawn, and the lights in many rooms shone dimly through them."
"“八点五十了！”年轻人大喊道，不耐烦中透着绝望。他转身背对着房子，朝相反的方向快速走了几步。","“Ten minutes to nine!” exclaimed the young man, with an impatient gesture of despair.He turned his back upon the house and took a rapid step or two in a contrary direction."
"“站住！”迈克尔王子命令道，声音如此有力，那个心烦意乱的人不得不转过身，带着些许苦笑。","“Remain!” commanded Prince Michael, in so potent a voice that the disturbed one wheeled around with a somewhat chagrined laugh."
"“再给她十分钟时间，然后我就走，”他咕哝道，接着大声对王子说，“我和您一道诅咒所有的时钟，我的朋友，另外还有女人。”","“I’ll give her the ten minutes and then I’m off,” he muttered, and then aloud to the Prince: “I’ll join you in confounding all clocks, my friend, and throw in women, too.”"
"“坐下吧，”王子从容地说，“我不同意加上女人。女人是时钟的天敌，因此，她们也是追求从时钟的束缚中解脱出来的同盟军；时钟计量我们的愚蠢，限制我们的快乐，真是个怪物。如果你到现在为止还相信我，请告诉我你的故事。”","“Sit down,” said the Prince calmly.“I do not accept your addition.Women are the natural enemies of clocks, and, therefore, the allies of those who would seek liberation from these monsters that measure our follies and limit our pleasures.If you will so far confide in me I would ask you to relate to me your story.”"
"年轻人一下子坐在长椅上，放声大笑。","The young man threw himself upon the bench with a reckless laugh."
"“王子殿下，我会说的，”他用假装恭敬的口气说，“您看到那边那幢房子——上面三个窗户都亮着灯的那幢？六点的时候我呆在那幢房子里，跟和我订了婚的——应该是，订过婚的——姑娘在一起。“我以前一直在做错事，我亲爱的王子殿下——我以前是个浪荡公子，她听说了这一切。我当然想得到宽恕——我们总是希望得到女人的宽恕，不是吗，王子殿下？”","“Your Royal Highness, I will,” he said, in tones of mock deference.“Do you see yonder house—the one with three upper windows lighted?Well, at 6 o’clock I stood in that house with the young lady I am—that is, I was—engaged to.I had been doing wrong, my dear Prince—I had been a naughty boy, and she had heard of it.I wanted to be forgiven, of course—we are always wanting women to forgive us, aren’t we, Prince?”"
"“‘我需要时间考虑，’她说，‘有一件事是肯定的；我要么完全宽恕你，要么再也不要看到你的脸。没有任何折中的办法。八点半的时候，’她说，‘八点半整的时候，你可以一直看着顶楼上面的窗户。如果我决定宽恕你，我会在窗外挂一条白丝巾。看到它你就知道一切还和以前一样，你可以来找我。如果你没有看到围巾，那就表示我们之间的一切永远结束了。’年轻人最后痛苦地说道：“这个就是为什么我一直看那座时钟的原因。距离信号应该出现的时间已经过了二十三分钟了。您还对我的焦虑不安感到好奇吗，我的衣衫褴褛、满脸胡茬的王子殿下？”","“‘I want time to think it over,’ said she.‘There is one thing certain; I will either fully forgive you, or I will never see your face again.There will be no half-way business.At half-past eight,’ she said, ‘at exactly half-past eight you may be watching the middle upper window of the top floor.If I decide to forgive I will hang out of that window a white silk scarf.You will know by that that all is as was before, and you may come to me.If you see no scarf you may consider that everything between us is ended forever.’That,” concluded the young man bitterly, “is why I have been watching that clock.The time for the signal to appear has passed twenty-three minutes ago.Do you wonder that I am a little disturbed, my Prince of Rags and Whiskers?”"
"“我重申一下，”迈克尔王子用平稳、舒缓的语调说，“女人是时钟的天敌。时钟是祸，女人是福。信号会出现的。”","“Let me repeat to you,” said Prince Michael, in his even, well-modulated tones, “that women are the natural enemies of clocks.Clocks are an evil, women a blessing.The signal may yet appear.”"
"“永远不会了，殿下！”年轻人绝望地大喊道，“您不了解玛丽安——这是当然。她一直很守时，一分不晚。这是她最吸引我的地方。我得到了拒绝，而不是围巾。八点三十一分的时候我就该知道一切都完了。我今晚十一点四十五要和杰克·米尔本到西部去。一切都完了。我要在杰克的牧场呆一阵子试试，然后灌饱威士忌，跳进克朗代克河。晚安了——嗯——嗯——王子殿下。”","“Never, on your principality!” exclaimed the young man, hopelessly.“You don’t know Marian—of course.She’s always on time, to the minute.That was the first thing about her that attracted me.I’ve got the mitten instead of the scarf.I ought to have known at 8.31 that my goose was cooked.I’ll go West on the 11.45 to-night with Jack Milburn.The jig’s up.I’ll try Jack’s ranch awhile and top off with the Klondike and whiskey.Good-night—er—er—Prince.”"
"迈克尔王子露出了难以捉摸、温文尔雅而又善解人意的笑容，他拉住了另一位的衣袖。王子眼中明亮的光彩柔和了下来，变得朦胧而又迷离。","Prince Michael smiled his enigmatic, gentle, comprehending smile and caught the coat sleeve of the other.The brilliant light in the Prince’s eyes was softening to a dreamier, cloudy translucence."
"“等等，”他郑重地说，“等到时钟敲响。我拥有超乎常人的财富、权力和学识，但时钟敲响的时候可就不一定了。陪我呆到那时候。这个女人会属于你的。巴列路纳世袭王子向你保证。你结婚那天我会送给你十万美金和位于哈得孙河旁的一座宫殿。但是宫殿里不能有时钟——它们计量我们的愚蠢，限制我们的快乐。你同意我说的吗？”","“Wait,” he said solemnly, “till the clock strikes.I have wealth and power and knowledge above most men, but when the clock strikes I am afraid.Stay by me until then.This woman shall be yours.You have the word of the hereditary Prince of Valleluna.On the day of your marriage I will give you $100,000 and a palace on the Hudson.But there must be no clocks in that palace—they measure our follies and limit our pleasures.Do you agree to that?”"
"“当然，”年轻人高兴地说道，“不管怎么说它们都令人讨厌——老是滴滴答答响着，还要当当报时，让人连吃晚饭都迟到了。”","“Of course,” said the young man, cheerfully, “they’re a nuisance, anyway—always ticking and striking and getting you late for dinner.”"
"他又看了一眼塔楼上的时钟。指针指向差三分九点的方向。","He glanced again at the clock in the tower.The hands stood at three minutes to nine."
"“我想，”迈克尔王子说，“我要睡一小会儿。白天太累人了。”","“I think,” said Prince Michael, “that I will sleep a little.The day has been fatiguing.”"
"他四肢摊开，躺在一张长椅上，从他的动作看得出他以前也这么睡过。","He stretched himself upon a bench with the manner of one who had slept thus before."
"“天气宜人的晚上，你总能在这个公园里找到我，”王子睡意朦胧地说，“婚期定下后来找我，我会给你一张十万美金的支票。”","“You will find me in this park on any evening when the weather is suitable,” said the Prince, sleepily.“Come to me when your marriage day is set and I will give you a cheque for the money.”"
"“谢谢，王子殿下，”年轻人一本正经地说，“我似乎并不需要位于哈得孙河旁的宫殿，但我同样感激您的馈赠。”","“Thanks, Your Highness,” said the young man, seriously.“It doesn’t look as if I would need that palace on the Hudson, but I appreciate your offer, just the same.”"
"迈克尔王子酣然沉睡。他那破破烂烂的帽子滚下长椅，落在了地上。年轻人捡起它，把它盖在王子脏兮兮的脸上，又把他的一只怪模怪样伸着的胳膊放得更舒服些。“可怜的家伙！”他边说边把王子破烂的衣服往胸前拽了拽。","Prince Michael sank into deep slumber.His battered hat rolled from the bench to the ground.The young man lifted it, placed it over the frowsy face and moved one of the grotesquely relaxed limbs into a more comfortable position.“Poor devil!” he said, as he drew the tattered clothes closer about the Prince’s breast."
"塔楼上传来响亮得吓人的九点报时声。年轻人又叹了口气，转过脸最后一次望向那幢他已不抱希望的房子——但他突然兴奋地大声骂起脏话来。","Sonorous and startling came the stroke of 9 from the clock tower.The young man sighed again, turned his face for one last look at the house of his relinquished hopes—and cried aloud profane words of holy rapture."
"暮色中，上面中间的窗外，神圣雪白的丝巾如花般绽放，它飞舞飘扬着，美极了，象征着宽恕和允诺之喜。","From the middle upper window blossomed in the dusk a waving, snowy, fluttering, wonderful, divine emblem of forgiveness and promised joy."
"一个市民路过，这人大腹便便、轻松自在，正匆匆往家赶，对于在这灯光昏暗的公园边界上空飘扬的丝巾所带来的喜悦，他浑然不知。","By came a citizen, rotund, comfortable, home-hurrying, unknowing of the delights of waving silken scarfs on the borders of dimly-lit parks."
"“先生，请问几点了？”年轻人问道。这位市民机警地确定自己的手表是安全的，然后掏出来看了看说：","“Will you oblige me with the time, sir?” asked the young man; and the citizen, shrewdly conjecturing his watch to be safe, dragged it out and announced: "
"“八点二十九分三十秒，先生。”","“Twenty-nine and a half minutes past eight, sir.”"
"接着，出于习惯，他看了一眼塔楼上的时钟，又说了一句：","And then, from habit, he glanced at the clock in the tower, and made further oration."
"“天哪！那座时钟快了半个小时！十年了，我头一次知道它不准。我的表可从来没有差过——”","“By George! that clock’s half an hour fast!First time in ten years I’ve known it to be off.This watch of mine never varies a—” "
"可这人却是在对着空气说话。他转过身，看到他说话的对象成了一个快速淡去的黑影，朝着一幢上面三个窗口亮着灯的房子飞奔而去。","But the citizen was talking to vacancy.He turned and saw his hearer, a fast receding black shadow, flying in the direction of a house with three lighted upper windows."
"第二天早上，两个警察走了过来，他们正在赶往自己的辖区。公园里空荡荡的，只有一个破破烂烂的身形四仰八叉地睡在长椅上。他们停下来盯着那身形看。","And in the morning came along two policemen on their way to the beats they owned.The park was deserted save for one dilapidated figure that sprawled, asleep, on a bench.They stopped and gazed upon it."
"“是多比·迈克。”一个警察说道，“他每天晚上都吸毒。他当公园流浪汉已经二十年了。我看他是快不行了。”","“It’s Dopy Mike,” said one.“He hits the pipe every night.Park bum for twenty years.On his last legs, I guess.”"
"另一个警察弯下腰，看到睡觉的家伙手里攥着一个皱巴巴的东西。","The other policeman stooped and looked at something crumpled and crisp in the hand of the sleeper."
"“哎呀！”他说道，“不管怎样，他还搞到了一张五十美元的钞票。要是能知道他吸的鸦片是什么牌子就好了。”","“Gee!” he remarked.“He’s doped out a fifty-dollar bill, anyway.Wish I knew the brand of hop that he smokes.”"
"之后，“梆，梆，梆！”现实世界的警棍敲在了巴列路纳封地迈克尔王子的鞋底上。","And then “Rap, rap, rap!” went the club of realism against the shoe soles of Prince Michael, of the Electorate of Valleluna."
