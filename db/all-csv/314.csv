"帕克妈妈的一生","Life of Ma Parker"
"作者：曼斯菲尔德","by  Katherine Mansfield        "
"帕克大妈每个礼拜二都来给这位作家先生清扫公寓。这天早上，作家先生一给她打开门，就问起她外孙的情况。帕克大妈站在门厅里的擦鞋垫上，门厅阴暗窄小，回话前她伸手帮先生关上了门。“昨天我们把他埋了，先生。”她轻声回答。","When the literary gentleman, whose flat old Ma Parker cleaned every Tuesday, opened the door to her that morning, he asked after her grandson.Ma Parker stood on the doormat inside the dark little hall, and she stretched out her hand to help her gentleman shut the door before she replied.“We buried ’im yesterday, sir,” she said quietly."
"“哦，天啊！听到这个消息我很难过。”作家先生用震惊的口吻感叹道。他的早餐刚吃到一半。他穿着一件很是寒酸的晨衣，一只手上拿着一份皱巴巴的报纸。但是他觉得有点别扭。他觉得要是不说些什么——不多说些什么的话，他也不好回到那暖和的起居室里去。而且他们这些人都是很看重葬礼的，因此他温和地说：“我想葬礼办得还好吧。”","“Oh, dear me! I’m sorry to hear that,” said the literary gentleman in a shocked tone.He was in the middle of his breakfast.He wore a very shabby dressing-gown and carried a crumpled newspaper in one hand.But he felt awkward.He could hardly go back to the warm sitting-room without saying something—something more.Then because these people set such store by funerals he said kindly, “I hope the funeral went off all right.”"
"“您说什么，先生？”年迈的帕克大妈声音嘶哑地问。可怜的老太太！她看起来的确是很消沉。“我想葬礼办得还——还行吧。”他说。帕克大妈没有回话。她耷拉着头，蹒跚地走向厨房，手里紧紧攥着一个旧的鱼口袋，那里头装着她的清扫工具、围裙和一双毡鞋。作家先生惊讶地扬了扬眉毛，然后接着吃他的早餐了。","“Beg parding, sir?” said old Ma Parker huskily.Poor old bird!She did look dashed.“I hope the funeral was a—a—success,” said he.Ma Parker gave no answer.She bent her head and hobbled off to the kitchen, clasping the old fish bag that held her cleaning things and an apron and a pair of felt shoes.The literary gentleman raised his eyebrows and went back to his breakfast."
"“我想一定难过得不得了。”他边大声说，边拿过橘子酱吃了起来。","“Overcome, I suppose,” he said aloud, helping himself to the marmalade."
"帕克大妈拔下帽子上的两个黑色帽针，然后把帽子挂在了门后。她又解开旧外衣的钩扣，把外衣也挂了上去。随后，她围上围裙，坐下来脱靴子。对她来说，无论是脱靴子还是穿靴子都疼得要命，然而这种痛苦她已经承受了很多年了。实际上，她早就习惯了这种痛苦，因此在解鞋带时，就已经扭曲着脸准备好承受那阵阵的刺痛了。过后，她舒了口气坐好，轻轻地揉着膝盖……","Ma Parker drew the two jetty spears out of her toque and hung it behind the door.She unhooked her worn jacket and hung that up too.Then she tied her apron and sat down to take off her boots.To take off her boots or to put them on was an agony to her, but it had been an agony for years.In fact, she was so accustomed to the pain that her face was drawn and screwed up ready for the twinge before she’d so much as untied the laces.That over, she sat back with a sigh and softly rubbed her knees..."
"“外婆！外婆！”她的小外孙穿着双带扣的小靴子，站在她的大腿上。他之前在大街上玩，现在刚刚进来。","“Gran! Gran!”Her little grandson stood on her lap in his button boots.He’d just come in from playing in the street."
"“瞧瞧你把外婆的裙子弄成什么样了——小捣蛋！”","“Look what a state you’ve made your gran’s skirt into—you wicked boy!”"
"但他却用两只胳膊搂着外婆的脖子，用脸蛋在她的脸上蹭来蹭去。","But he put his arms round her neck and rubbed his cheek against hers."
"“外婆，给我们一便士吧！”他花言巧语道。“快下去；外婆可没钱。”","“Gran, gi’ us a penny!” he coaxed.“Be off with you; Gran ain’t got no pennies.”"
"“不嘛，你有。”","“Yes, you ’ave.”"
"“没有，我没有。”","“No, I ain’t.”"
"“不嘛，你有。给我们一便士！”","“Yes, you ’ave.Gi’ us one!”"
"而她早已在摸那个又旧又扁的黑皮钱包了。","Already she was feeling for the old, squashed, black leather purse."
"“那么，你会给外婆什么呀？”","“Well, what’ll you give your gran?”"
"他害羞地微微一笑，搂得更紧了。她感觉得到小外孙的眼皮贴在她脸上一颤一颤的。“我什么也没有哇。”他咕哝着……","He gave a shy little laugh and pressed closer.She felt his eyelid quivering against her cheek.“I ain’t got nothing,” he murmured..."
"老妇人霍地站起身来，一把将铁水壶从煤气炉上拿下来，放进水槽里。水流入壶中，发出咚咚的响声，这声音好像让她不那么难受了。她又往桶里和洗碟盆里放水。","The old woman sprang up, seized the iron kettle off the gas stove and took it over to the sink.The noise of the water drumming in the kettle deadened her pain, it seemed.She filled the pail, too, and the washing-up bowl."
"要形容那厨房的情形，真能花上一本书的篇幅。这个礼拜是作家先生自己“收拾”房子的。确切点说，他只是时不时地把茶叶渣倒在特意放在旁边的果酱罐里。当他用光干净餐叉时，就从用过的里面拿出一两把来，在擦手毛巾上蹭蹭，接着再用。不过，倒像他对朋友解释的那样，他的“方式”非常简易，而且他也不懂为什么有人会对做家务小题大做。","It would take a whole book to describe the state of that kitchen.During the week the literary gentleman “did” for himself.That is to say, he emptied the tea leaves now and again into a jam jar set aside for that purpose, and if he ran out of clean forks he wiped over one or two on the roller towel.Otherwise, as he explained to his friends, his “system” was quite simple, and he couldn’t understand why people made all this fuss about housekeeping."
"“你只不过是把每样东西都弄脏之后，雇个老妈子来每礼拜清扫一次，问题就解决了。”","“You simply dirty everything you’ve got, get a hag in once a week to clean up, and the thing’s done.”"
"他收拾后的厨房看上去就像个巨大的垃圾箱。甚至连地板上都满是乱丢的烤面包皮、信封和烟蒂。不过帕克大妈倒没抱怨他。她很同情这位贫穷的年轻作家，因为没人照顾他。透过模糊不清的小窗子，你能看到广袤黯然的天空。无论何时，只要天上有云，这些云看上去都是又破又旧，边上都磨损了，中间还有窟窿，或者有像茶渍般的深色污点。","The result looked like a gigantic dustbin.Even the floor was littered with toast crusts, envelopes, cigarette ends.But Ma Parker bore him no grudge.She pitied the poor young gentleman for having no one to look after him.Out of the smudgy little window you could see an immense expanse of sad-looking sky, and whenever there were clouds they looked very worn, old clouds, frayed at the edges, with holes in them, or dark stains like tea."
"趁烧水时，帕克大妈开始扫地。随着扫帚一下一下触到地上，她心想：“说真的，什么事都让我碰上了。我的命真苦啊。”","While the water was heating, Ma Parker began sweeping the floor.“Yes,” she thought, as the broom knocked, “what with one thing and another I’ve had my share.I’ve had a hard life.”"
"甚至她的邻居们谈起她也这么说。有许多次，当她拿着鱼口袋步履蹒跚地往家走时，她常听到呆在拐角或是斜靠在庭院栅栏上的邻居们在一起谈论：“她的命真苦啊，帕克大妈可真惨。”话说得没错，可她却一点也没觉得得意。这话就好比是你要说她住在二十七号地下室的后面似的。命真苦啊！……","Even the neighbours said that of her.Many a time, hobbling home with her fish bag she heard them, waiting at the corner, or leaning over the area railings, say among themselves, “She’s had a hard life, has Ma Parker.”And it was so true she wasn’t in the least proud of it.It was just as if you were to say she lived in the basement-back at Number 27.A hard life!..."
"她在十六岁时离开斯特拉特福，来伦敦当了一名在厨房帮工的女佣。没错，她就是出生在埃文河畔—斯特拉特福。先生，您是问莎士比亚吗？不知道。人们总是向她问起莎士比亚。可直到后来去了剧院她才看到这个名字，以前可从没听说过。","At sixteen she’d left Stratford and come up to London as kitching-maid.Yes, she was born in Stratford-on-Avon.Shakespeare, sir?No, people were always asking her about him.But she’d never heard his name until she saw it on the theatres."
"除了“晚上坐在壁炉里，透过烟囱可以看到天上的星星”，还有“妈妈总是把腌熏的猪肋肉吊在天花板上”，她对斯特拉特福就没别的记忆了。还有些什么——灌木林，是有一片——就在大门前，它的味道总是那么好闻。不过她对灌木林的印象也很模糊了。只是在医院里她想起过一两次，当时她生病了。","Nothing remained of Stratford except that “sitting in the fire-place of a evening you could see the stars through the chimley,” and “Mother always ’ad ’er side of bacon, ’anging from the ceiling.”And there was something—a bush, there was—at the front door, that smelt ever so nice.But the bush was very vague.She’d only remembered it once or twice in the hospital, when she’d been taken bad."
"她做第一份差事的那个地方糟透了。他们从不许她外出。除早晚做祷告外，她连楼上都不能去。地下室还行。厨娘是个刻毒的女人。厨娘常常在她还没来得及读家信前就一把将信夺过来，扔进炉膛里，因为来信会让她开始空想……还有执事！（注：此处“beedle”应为“beadle”，意为“英国负责教堂秩序、侍奉教士等的教区执事”）你能相信吗？——在来伦敦之前她从没有见过黑人执事。一想到这儿，大妈总是笑笑，好像——还没见过黑人执事似的！很好！这就好像说你从未见过自己的双脚一样。","That was a dreadful place—her first place.She was never allowed out.She never went upstairs except for prayers morning and evening.It was a fair cellar.And the cook was a cruel woman.She used to snatch away her letters from home before she’d read them, and throw them in the range because they made her dreamy... And the beedles!Would you believe it?—until she came to London she’d never seen a black beedle.Here Ma always gave a little laugh, as though—not to have seen a black beedle!Well!It was as if to say you’d never seen your own feet."
"在那家的房子被卖掉后，她就去了一位医生家当“帮佣”。在那儿从早到晚地忙了两年后，她嫁了人。她的丈夫是个面包师。","When that family was sold up she went as “help” to a doctor’s house, and after two years there, on the run from morning till night, she married her husband.He was a baker."
"作家先生会说：“面包师啊，帕克太太！”","“A baker, Mrs. Parker!” the literary gentleman would say."
"因为他偶尔也会放下手中的大部头书卷，至少是听一听这所谓的“人生”。“嫁给面包师想必是相当不错吧！”","For occasionally he laid aside his tomes and lent an ear, at least, to this product called Life.“It must be rather nice to be married to a baker!”"
"帕克太太对此显得不太确定。","Mrs. Parker didn’t look so sure."
"“这行当多干净啊。”作家先生又说。","“Such a clean trade,” said the gentleman."
"看样子帕克太太还是不十分确信。","Mrs. Parker didn’t look convinced."
"“难道你不喜欢把新出炉的面包递给顾客们？”","“And didn’t you like handing the new loaves to the customers?”"
"“哎呀，先生，”帕克太太说，“我不常呆在店里头。我们生了十三个小家伙，里头有七个没活成。可以这么说吧，我不是到医院去，就是往小诊所跑！”","“Well, sir,” said Mrs. Parker, “I wasn’t in the shop above a great deal. We had thirteen little ones and buried seven of them.If it wasn’t the ’ospital it was the infirmary, you might say!”"
"“确实可以这么说，帕克太太！”作家先生说完，打了个寒噤，又接着写他的文章了。","“You might, indeed, Mrs. Parker!” said the gentleman, shuddering and taking up his pen again."
"是的，有七个孩子夭折了，剩下的六个还年幼的时候，她丈夫又得了痨病。当时医生对她说，就是因为面粉被吸进肺里了……她丈夫在床上坐起身来，把衬衣撩过头顶，医生就用手指在他的后背上画了个圈。","Yes, seven had gone, and while the six were still small her husband was taken ill with consumption.It was flour on the lungs, the doctor told her at the time... Her husband sat up in bed with his shirt pulled over his head, and the doctor’s finger drew a circle on his back."
"“帕克太太，要是我们现在在这儿开刀的话，”医生说，“你就会看到他的肺里塞的全是白面粉。呼吸，老兄！”她可怜的丈夫临死前从嘴里喷出一大片白色粉末，像扇面似的。她一直没弄明白这场面到底是她亲眼所见呢，还是她臆想出来的……","“Now, if we were to cut him open here, Mrs. Parker,” said the doctor, “you’d find his lungs chock-a-block with white powder.Breathe, my good fellow!”And Mrs. Parker never knew for certain whether she saw or whether she fancied she saw a great fan of white dust come out of her poor dead husband’s lips..."
"但为了把六个孩子抚养成人，她受尽磨难，还得把这些苦楚憋在心里。那时过得太苦了！后来，就在孩子们到了上学的年龄时，她丈夫的姐姐暂时搬来和他们住在一起，帮她度过难关。然而他姐姐还没住上两个月，就从楼梯上滚了下去，摔坏了脊柱。于是在之后的五年里，帕克大妈又多了个孩子要照顾——照顾这样的孩子真是叫人欲哭不能啊！再后来，年轻的莫迪误入歧途，还把她妹妹艾丽斯拉下了水。两个男孩子移居他乡，小吉姆当兵去了印度。还有最小的孩子埃塞尔嫁了一个一无是处的侍应生，这人在小伦尼出生那年因得溃疡而死。现在轮到小伦尼——我的外孙了……","But the struggle she’d had to bring up those six little children and keep herself to herself.Terrible it had been!Then, just when they were old enough to go to school her husband’s sister came to stop with them to help things along, and she hadn’t been there more than two months when she fell down a flight of steps and hurt her spine.And for five years Ma Parker had another baby—and such a one for crying!—to look after.Then young Maudie went wrong and took her sister Alice with her; the two boys emigrated, and young Jim went to India with the army, and Ethel, the youngest, married a good-for-nothing little waiter who died of ulcers the year little Lennie was born.And now little Lennie—my grandson..."
"她把成摞的脏杯子和脏碟子都洗净了，也擦干了。她拿马铃薯片将墨黑色的刀具磨净，又用一块软木塞把它们打磨得锃亮。餐桌擦净了，碗橱也收拾好了，还有漂着沙丁鱼尾的水池……","The piles of dirty cups, dirty dishes, were washed and dried.The ink-black knives were cleaned with a piece of potato and finished off with a piece of cork.The table was scrubbed, and the dresser and the sink that had sardine tails swimming in it..."
"他从来都不是健壮结实的孩子——一生下来就不是。他是那种长得白净秀气的孩子，大家都会误以为是女孩子。他有一头亮银色的卷发，一双湛蓝的眼睛，鼻子的一侧还有颗钻石般的小雀斑。为了养育他，帕克大妈和埃塞尔费了多少心思啊！她们甚至还从报纸上找了许多办法给他试！每个礼拜天早上，埃塞尔都会大声读报，帕克大妈则在一边洗衣服。","He’d never been a strong child—never from the first.He’d been one of those fair babies that everybody took for a girl.Silvery fair curls he had, blue eyes, and a little freckle like a diamond on one side of his nose.The trouble she and Ethel had had to rear that child!The things out of the newspapers they tried him with!Every Sunday morning Ethel would read aloud while Ma Parker did her washing."
"“亲爱的先生，——我只说一句好叫您了解，我的小默特尔都在等死了……服用了四瓶之后..……在九个礼拜中长了八磅，而且体重还在继续增长。”","“Dear Sir,—Just a line to let you know my little Myrtil was laid out for dead... After four bottils... gained 8 lbs. in 9 weeks, and is still putting it on.”"
"接着她们就会从碗橱里拿出装墨水的蛋杯，把信写好，次日清晨在去干活的路上，帕克大妈会买张邮政汇票。可这也是枉费了气力。任何方法都没让小伦尼多长出点肉来。甚至带他去公墓也从没让他的小脸上有点血色；坐在公共汽车上好一阵子的颠簸，也从没叫他的胃口变得好点。","And then the egg-cup of ink would come off the dresser and the letter would be written, and Ma would buy a postal order on her way to work next morning.But it was no use.Nothing made little Lennie put it on.Taking him to the cemetery, even, never gave him a colour; a nice shake-up in the bus never improved his appetite."
"但他从出生起就是外婆的宝贝……","But he was gran’s boy from the first..."
"帕克大妈在炉边站直身子，一面走向污迹斑斑的窗子，一面说着：“你是谁的宝贝啊？”这时，一个细嫩的嗓音笑出声，然后说：“我是外婆的宝贝呀！”这声音温暖亲热得让她差点喘不上气来——好像就来自她心窝里一样。","“Whose boy are you?” said old Ma Parker, straightening up from the stove and going over to the smudgy window.And a little voice, so warm, so close, it half stifled her—it seemed to be in her breast under her heart—laughed out, and said, “I’m gran’s boy!”"
"正在这时，传来一阵脚步声，作家先生出来了。他穿戴整齐，准备去散步了。","At that moment there was a sound of steps, and the literary gentleman appeared, dressed for walking."
"“哦，帕克太太，我要出去一趟。”","“Oh, Mrs. Parker, I’m going out.”"
"“知道了，先生。”","“Very good, sir.”"
"“墨水台的托盘里有半克朗，那是你的报酬，你把它拿走吧。”","“And you’ll find your half-crown in the tray of the inkstand.”"
"“谢谢您，先生。”","“Thank you, sir.”"
"“噢，对了，帕克太太，”作家先生快速说道，“上回你在这儿时没把可可粉扔掉，是吧？”","“Oh, by the way, Mrs. Parker,” said the literary gentleman quickly, “you didn’t throw away any cocoa last time you were here—did you?”"
"“没扔，先生。”“真怪。我敢发誓我是在罐里留了一茶匙可可粉的。”他突然住口。接着他说道：“要是你想扔掉什么东西，总得先和我说一下——没错吧，帕克太太？”他的声音不大，但语气却很强硬。然后他洋洋自得地走开了，确信自己其实已让帕克太太看出来，他虽表面上粗枝大叶，但内心深处却像女人一样警醒。","“No, sir.”“Very strange.I could have sworn I left a teaspoonful of cocoa in the tin.”He broke off.He said softly and firmly, “You’ll always tell me when you throw things away—won’t you, Mrs. Parker?”And he walked off very well pleased with himself, convinced, in fact, he’d shown Mrs. Parker that under his apparent carelessness he was as vigilant as a woman."
"门砰地一下关上了。她拿起刷子和抹布进了卧室。她开始整理床铺，把褶皱弄平，掖好边角，又轻轻拍了拍。但这时，她又想起了小伦尼，想得她快受不了了。他为什么非得受这份罪呢？她就是不能理解这一点。为什么一个天使般的小孩子要为了能喘上气来而苦苦挣扎呢？让小孩受这样的罪真是没有天理。","The door banged.She took her brushes and cloths into the bedroom.But when she began to make the bed, smoothing, tucking, patting, the thought of little Lennie was unbearable.Why did he have to suffer so?That’s what she couldn’t understand.Why should a little angel child have to ask for his breath and fight for it?There was no sense in making a child suffer like that."
"……从伦尼小小的胸腔里传出一种声响，好像是什么东西煮开了似的。在他胸腔里有个大肿块，一直咕嘟地响个不停，他却没有办法摆脱它。他一咳嗽就满头大汗，双眼凸出，两手乱挥。那个大肿块发出噗噗的声响，就像马铃薯在炖锅里翻滚似的。但最让人揪心的是，当他不咳的时候，就靠着枕头坐着，既不说话也不回话，甚至假装他听到了。只是他看上去非常不开心。","... From Lennie’s little box of a chest there came a sound as though something was boiling.There was a great lump of something bubbling in his chest that he couldn’t get rid of.When he coughed the sweat sprang out on his head; his eyes bulged, his hands waved, and the great lump bubbled as a potato knocks in a saucepan.But what was more awful than all was when he didn’t cough he sat against the pillow and never spoke or answered, or even made as if he heard.Only he looked offended."
"“这可不是你可怜的老外婆做的啊，小乖乖。”帕克老大妈一边说着，一边把他湿漉漉的头发拢到他红红的小耳朵后面。但伦尼却头一扭躲开了。看起来他很生她的气——表情也十分严肃。他垂着头，斜眼看了看她，仿佛从来都不会相信他外婆说的话。","“It’s not your poor old gran’s doing it, my lovey,” said old Ma Parker, patting back the damp hair from his little scarlet ears.But Lennie moved his head and edged away.Dreadfully offended with her he looked—and solemn.He bent his head and looked at her sideways as though he couldn’t have believed it of his gran."
"但是最终……帕克大妈把床罩抖开在床上铺好。不，她实在不能再想这件事了。这让她没法再忍下去——她这辈子忍受得已经太多了。她一直强忍到现在，把一切都憋在心里，而且从没在他人面前哭过。真的是没人见她哭过。甚至连她自己的孩子也没见过她感情失控的样子。她总是保持着骄傲的姿态。但是现在！伦尼已经死了——她还剩下什么？她什么都没有了。他就是她的命根子啊，可是现在连他也被夺去了。为什么所有的事都让我赶上了呢？她疑惑不解。“我做了什么？”帕克老大妈自问道，“我到底做了什么？”","But at the last... Ma Parker threw the counterpane over the bed.No, she simply couldn’t think about it.It was too much—she’d had too much in her life to bear.She’d borne it up till now, she’d kept herself to herself, and never once had she been seen to cry.Never by a living soul.Not even her own children had seen Ma break down.She’d kept a proud face always.But now!Lennie gone—what had she?She had nothing.He was all she’d got from life, and now he was took too.Why must it all have happened to me?she wondered.“What have I done?” said old Ma Parker.“What have I done?”"
"当她喃喃自语时，刷子猛地从她手中滑落。她发现自己又回到了厨房。她太难受了，所以如同梦游一般，用帽针别好帽子，穿上外衣，走出了公寓。她都没意识到自己在做什么。她像是一个经历了可怕事件而吓得不知所措的人，一心只想走开——去哪儿都行，好像这样就可以脱身了……","As she said those words she suddenly let fall her brush.She found herself in the kitchen.Her misery was so terrible that she pinned on her hat, put on her jacket and walked out of the flat like a person in a dream.She did not know what she was doing.She was like a person so dazed by the horror of what has happened that he walks away—anywhere, as though by walking away he could escape..."
"大街上很冷。吹来的风冰冷刺骨。人们行色匆匆，走得飞快；男人们走起来如同剪刀，铿锵有力；而女人们走起来则如同小猫，优雅轻盈。也没人了解她所受的煎熬——没人在意。即使她真熬不住了，就算过了这么多年她终于要放声痛哭，她也很可能会被抓起来。","It was cold in the street.There was a wind like ice.People went flitting by, very fast; the men walked like scissors; the women trod like cats.And nobody knew—nobody cared.Even if she broke down, if at last, after all these years, she were to cry, she’d find herself in the lock-up as like as not."
"但她一想到哭，就觉得小伦尼好像又一下子扑进外婆的怀里。啊，我的小宝贝，这正是外婆想做的事啊。外婆想哭啊。如果现在真的能哭，她就会为所遭受的一切痛哭一场，从她做第一份差事的地方和那个狠毒的厨娘开始，接着是那个医生家，然后是七个夭折的孩子、丈夫的过世、孩子们离她而去，还有这么多年她遭受的种种煎熬，一直到伦尼的死。不过她得花很长时间才能把所有的事情哭个痛快。不管怎样，这一时刻已经来到了。她必须要哭了。她不能再拖延下去；她也不能再等待下去……可她能到哪儿去哭呢？","But at the thought of crying it was as though little Lennie leapt in his gran’s arms.Ah, that’s what she wants to do, my dove.Gran wants to cry.If she could only cry now, cry for a long time, over everything, beginning with her first place and the cruel cook, going on to the doctor’s, and then the seven little ones, death of her husband, the children’s leaving her, and all the years of misery that led up to Lennie.But to have a proper cry over all these things would take a long time.All the same, the time for it had come.She must do it.She couldn’t put it off any longer; she couldn’t wait any more... Where could she go?"
"“她的命真苦，帕克大妈实在命苦。”是啊，命真苦啊，一点没错！她的下颌开始颤抖；没时间再等了。但是去哪儿呢？她能去哪儿哭呢？","“She’s had a hard life, has Ma Parker.”Yes, a hard life, indeed!Her chin began to tremble; there was no time to lose.But where?Where?"
"她不能回家哭；埃塞尔在家。那会把她吓坏的。她也不能随便找个长椅坐下来哭；行人会来问个不停的。她不可能回到作家先生的公寓里去哭；她没权力在外人家里哭。要是她坐在什么台阶上哭，警察会来盘问她的。","She couldn’t go home; Ethel was there.It would frighten Ethel out of her life.She couldn’t sit on a bench anywhere; people would come arsking her questions.She couldn’t possibly go back to the gentleman’s flat; she had no right to cry in strangers’ houses.If she sat on some steps a policeman would speak to her."
"唉，难道就真的找不出一个地方，让她可以躲起来，一个人想呆多久呆多久，既不惊动别人，别人也不打扰她？难道这世上终究都找不到可以让她放声痛哭的地方吗？","Oh, wasn’t there anywhere where she could hide and keep herself to herself and stay as long as she liked, not disturbing anybody, and nobody worrying her?Wasn’t there anywhere in the world where she could have her cry out—at last?"
"帕克大妈站着，到处看了看。冰冷的风把她的围裙吹得鼓起来，像个气球。此时开始下雨了。帕克大妈无处去哭。","Ma Parker stood, looking up and down.The icy wind blew out her apron into a balloon.And now it began to rain.There was nowhere."
