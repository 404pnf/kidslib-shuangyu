"第一章","CHAPTER 1"
"“我起床了，泰迪林克斯。”惠斯顿太太说着便迅速地从床上一跃而起。","“I’m getting up, Teddilinks,” said Mrs Whiston, and she sprang out of bed briskly."
"“汉诺威市把你怎么着了？”惠斯顿问道。","“What the Hanover’s got you?” asked Whiston."
"“没什么啊。难道我就不能起床吗？”她机灵地答道。","“Nothing.Can’t I get up?” she replied animatedly."
"早晨七点左右，冰冷的房间里依稀有些光线。惠斯顿静静地躺着，看着妻子。她是个漂亮的小美人，一头柔软乌黑的短发乱作一团……他注视着她，而她迅速地穿上衣服，扭动娇小美丽的身躯，把衣服胡乱地裹在身上。她的懒散和不修边幅并没有使他烦心。她拿起衬裙裙边，扯下一条坏了的白色花边，将它扔到梳妆台上。她不经意的举动使他十分高兴。她站在镜子前，将浓密的短发稍微梳理了一番。他以丈夫的神情静静地欣赏着她轻快而温柔地抖动着柔嫩的肩膀。","It was about seven o’clock, scarcely light yet in the cold bedroom.Whiston lay still and looked at his wife.She was a pretty little thing, with her fleecy, short black hair all tousled…He watched her as she dressed quickly, flicking her small, delightful limbs, throwing her clothes about her.Her slovenliness and untidiness did not trouble him.When she picked up the edge of her petticoat, ripped off a torn string of white lace, and flung it on the dressing-table, her careless abandon made his spirit glow.She stood before the mirror and roughly scrambled together her profuse little mane of hair.He watched the quickness and softness of her young shoulders, calmly, like a husband, and appreciatively."
"“起床了，”她朝他快速地挥了挥胳膊，嚷道，“打起精神来。”","“Rise up,” she cried, turning to him with a quick wave of her arm—“and shine forth.”"
"他们已经结婚两年了。但是，每当她从房间出去的时候，他仍然会感觉到所有的光和热仿佛都消失了，并会发现清晨的严寒和冰冷。就这样，他起床了，随意地想着是什么让她起那么早。通常她都是在床上能赖多久就赖多久。","They had been married two years.But still, when she had gone out of the room, he felt as if all his light and warmth were taken away, he became aware of the raw, cold morning.So he rose himself, wondering casually what had roused her so early.Usually she lay in bed as late as she could."
"惠斯顿穿上衬衫和裤子，在腰上系紧一条腰带后下了楼。他听到她在断断续续地唱歌。楼梯在他的重压下嘎吱作响。他穿过被她称为门厅的狭小过道。这座廉价的房子是他的第一个家。","Whiston fastened a belt round his loins and went downstairs in shirt and trousers.He heard her singing in her snatchy fashion.The stairs creaked under his weight.He passed down the narrow little passage, which she called a hall, of the seven and sixpenny house which was his first home."
"他大约二十八岁，是个身材匀称的年轻人。他现在有些困意，显得温和安宁。他听见水滴不断掉进壶里，她开始吹起了口哨。她在水龙头下冲洗晚餐用过的杯子好为早餐做准备。他就喜欢她那麻利的样子。她看上去像一个衣冠不整的轻佻女子，但却敏捷手巧。","He was a shapely young fellow of about twenty-eight, sleepy now and easy with well-being.He heard the water drumming into the kettle, and she began to whistle.He loved the quick way she dodged the supper cups under the tap to wash them for breakfast.She looked an untidy minx, but she was quick and handy enough."
"“泰迪林克斯。”她喊道。","“Teddilinks,” she cried."
"“怎么了？”","“What?”"
"“生火，快。”","“Light a fire, quick.”"
"她穿着一件旧的、胸前别着黑色丝绸的宽大晨衣。但是有一只袖子开线了，露出了她令人心动的粉嫩的上臂。","She wore an old, sack-like dressing-jacket of black silk pinned across her breast.But one of the sleeves, coming unfastened, showed some delightful pink upper-arm."
"“你为什么不把袖子缝上？”他问道，不想看到她柔嫩的肌肤暴露在外。","“Why don’t you sew your sleeve up?” he said, suffering from the sight of the exposed soft flesh."
"“哪里？”她仔细地到处看着问道。","“Where?” she cried, peering round."
"“讨厌。”她看见了裂缝后说道，接着继续轻巧地把杯子擦干净。","“Nuisance,” she said, seeing the gap, then with light fingers went on drying the cups."
"厨房不算小，但是很阴暗。惠斯顿扒出烧尽的灰。","The kitchen was of fair size, but gloomy.Whiston poked out the dead ashes."
"突然，楼下的走廊传来了砰砰的敲门声。","Suddenly a thud was heard at the door down the passage."
"“我去开。”惠斯顿太太喊着来到了楼下厅里。","“I’ll go,” cried Mrs Whiston, and she was gone down the hall."
"邮递员是个脸色红润的伙计，曾经当过兵。他边咧着嘴笑，边给她递过来几个包裹。","The postman was a ruddy-faced man who had been a soldier.He smiled broadly, handing her some packages."
"“他们并没有忘记你。”他冒失地说道。","“They’ve not forgot you,” he said impudently."
"“是没有忘记——他们会走运的。”她猛抬起头，说道。但是她只对今天早晨收到的信件感兴趣。邮递员露出讨好的微笑，好奇地等着。她慢慢地、心不在焉地当着他的面把门关上了，好像不知道门外有人似的，然后继续看着信上的地址。","“No—lucky for them,” she said, with a toss of the head.But she was interested only in her envelopes this morning.The postman waited inquisitively, smiling in an ingratiating fashion.She slowly, abstractedly, as if she did not know anyone was there, closed the door in his face, continuing to look at the addresses on her letters."
"她撕开薄薄的信封。厅里有一张长长的，难看的卡通情人卡。她略微一笑，把卡片丢到了地板上。她用力扯开包装绳，打开了一个白色的纸板箱，里面一只白色的丝绸手帕整齐地叠放在盒子纸质花边的底下。她名字首字母的淡紫色图案全部呈现出来了。她开心地笑了，轻轻地把盒子放到了一边。第三个信封里还有一个白色包裹——里面显然是一只叠放整齐的棉手帕。她把它抖了出来。原来那是一只白色的长丝袜，但脚趾处有什么东西。她快速地把胳膊伸进去，扭动着手指探向丝袜的脚趾处，取出一个小盒子。她往盒子里瞥了一眼，然后匆忙打开左手边的门，走进狭小阴冷的起居室。她使劲咬住下嘴唇。","She tore open the thin envelope.There was a long, hideous, cartoon valentine.She smiled briefly and dropped it on the floor.Struggling with the string of a packet, she opened a white cardboard box, and there lay a white silk handkerchief packed neatly under the paper lace of the box, and her initial, worked in heliotrope, fully displayed.She smiled pleasantly, and gently put the box aside.The third envelope contained another white packet—apparently a cotton handkerchief neatly folded.She shook it out.It was a long white stocking, but there was a little weight in the toe.Quickly, she thrust down her arm, wriggling her fingers into the toe of the stocking, and brought out a small box.She peeped inside the box, then hastily opened a door on her left hand, and went into the little, cold sitting-room.She had her lower lip caught earnestly between her teeth."
"带着瞬间的狂喜，她从小盒子里拿出了一对珍珠耳环，然后走到镜子跟前。在镜前，她开始认真地把耳环穿在耳朵上，照着镜中自己的侧面。她的头侧弯着，伸手摸着自己的耳垂，显得极为专注。","With a little flash of triumph, she lifted a pair of pearl ear-rings from the small box, and she went to the mirror.There, earnestly, she began to hook them through her ears, looking at herself sideways in the glass.Curiously concentrated and intent she seemed as she fingered the lobes of her ears, her head bent on one side."
"那对珍珠耳环正在她那小小的红润的双耳下悬挂着。她用力地摇了摇头，想看看耳环摇晃的样子。耳环轻快地碰在她的脖颈上，使她感到一阵凉意。然后她站在原地看着自己，高贵地昂着头。然后她看着自己的样子傻笑了。看着自己镜子里的目光，她禁不住朝自己眨了眨眼，笑了起来。","Then the pearl ear-rings dangled under her rosy, small ears.She shook her head sharply, to see the swing of the drops.They went chill against her neck, in little, sharp touches.Then she stood still to look at herself, bridling her head in the dignified fashion.Then she simpered at herself.Catching her own eye, she could not help winking at herself and laughing."
"她转过身去看那个盒子。盒子里有一张碎纸片，上面是这么写的：","She turned to look at the box.There was a scrap of paper with this posy:"
"“珍珠也许美丽，但你却更美丽。","“Pearls may be fair, but thou art fairer."
"为我戴上它们吧，我会爱上那位佩戴者。”","Wear these for me, and I’ll love the wearer.”"
"她做了个鬼脸，咧嘴笑了起来。但她还是忍不住回到镜子跟前看那对耳环。","She made a grimace and a grin.But she was drawn to the mirror again, to look at her ear-rings."
"惠斯顿已经把火生了起来，便过来找她。她听到他来了，迅速转过身，面露愧疚之色。他出现时，她用那蓝色的眼睛热切地看着他。","Whiston had made the fire burn, so he came to look for her.When she heard him, she started round quickly, guiltily.She was watching him with intent blue eyes when he appeared."
"他处在早晨昏昏欲睡的暖和的感觉之中，并没看见什么。如往常一样，他给她一种暖洋洋和慢腾腾的感觉。他的眼睛很蓝，很和善，态度很坦率。","He did not see much, in his morning-drowsy warmth.He gave her, as ever, a feeling of warmth and slowness.His eyes were very blue, very kind, his manner simple."
"“你收到了什么？”他问道。","“What ha’ you got?” he asked."
"“情人节的礼物。”她轻快地答道，转过头去向他炫耀地展示那块丝绸手帕。她把手帕凑近他的鼻子底下。“闻起来挺好的吧。”她说道。","“Valentines,” she said briskly, ostentatiously turning to show him the silk handkerchief.She thrust it under his nose.“Smell how good,” she said."
"“谁送的？”他问道，并没有闻。","“Who’s that from?” he replied, without smelling."
"“不过是情人节的礼物而已，”她说，“我怎么知道是谁送的？”","“It’s a valentine,” she cried.“How da I know who it’s from?”"
"“我打赌你准知道。”他说。","“I’ll bet you know,” he said."
"“泰德！——我不知道！”她开始摇着头喊道，但因为耳环而停了下来。","“Ted!—I don’t!” she cried, beginning to shake her head, then stopping because of the ear-rings."
"他在原地站了一会儿，不高兴起来。","He stood still a moment, displeased."
"“现在，他们已经无权送你情人节礼物了。”他说。","“They’ve no right to send you valentines, now,” he said."
"“泰德！——为什么没有？”你不是在嫉妒吧，对不对？我真一点都不知道这是谁送给我的。“看——有我名字的首字母”——为了表示强调，她的手指向淡紫色的刺绣——","“Ted!—Why not?You’re not jealous, are you?I haven’t the least idea who it’s from.""Look—there’s my initial”—she pointed with an emphatic finger at the heliotrope embroidery—"
"“Ｅ代表埃尔西。”她歌唱似的说道。","“E for Elsie, nice little gelsie.” she sang."
"“别扯了，”他说道，“你知道这是谁给的。”","“Get out,” he said.“You know who it’s from.”"
"“真的，我不知道。”她反驳道。","“Truth, I don’t,” she cried."
"他看了看四周，发现了那只放在椅子上的白丝袜。","He looked round, and saw the white stocking lying on a chair."
"“这也是情人节的礼物？”他问道。","“Is this another?” he said."
"“不，那是个样品，”她答道，“就只有张卡通贺卡。”然后她便拿来了那张长长的卡通贺卡。","“No, that’s a sample,” she said.“There’s only a comic.”And she fetched in the long cartoon."
"他打开贺卡，表情严肃地看了看它。","He stretched it out and looked at it solemnly."
"“傻瓜！”他说着就走出了房间。","“Fools!” he said, and went out of the room."
"她飞快地跑到楼上，把耳环摘了下来。","She flew upstairs and took off the ear-rings."
"当她回来的时候，他正蹲在火前给煤吹风。他面色发红，脸上略微显出些疤痕，好像曾经患过天花似的。但是他的脖子却白净光滑，很好看。他蹲在那里，她用双臂搂住他的脖子，紧紧地抱住他。他踮起脚尖来保持平衡。","When she returned, he was crouched before the fire blowing the coals.The skin of his face was flushed, and slightly pitted, as if he had had small-pox.But his neck was white and smooth and goodly.She hung her arms round his neck as he crouched there, and clung to him.He balanced on his toes."
"“这堆火也是慢性子。”他说道。","“This fire’s a slow-coach,” he said."
"“那还有谁是慢性子的呢？”她问道。","“And who else is a slow-coach?” she said."
"“咱们中间的一个啊，我觉得。”他小心地站起来，说道。她仍然紧紧地抱住他的脖子，脚悬在了半空中。","“One of us two, I know,” he said, and he rose carefully.She remained clinging round his neck, so that she was lifted off her feet."
"“哈！——带着我转几圈。”她喊道。","“Ha!—swing me,” she cried."
"他低下头，她双脚悬空，挂在他脖子上摇晃，大笑着。然后她滑了下来。","He lowered his head, and she hung in the air, swinging from his neck, laughing.Then she slipped off."
"“水壶响了。”她唱到，飞快地跑向茶壶。他又弯下身子去吹火。他的衬衣领子好像太紧了，脖子上的青筋暴露出来。","“The kettle is singing,” she sang, flying for the teapot.He bent down again to blow the fire.The veins in his neck stood out, his shirt collar seemed too tight."
"“怀尔博士，快吹火，噗！噗！噗！”她笑着唱道。","“Doctor Wyer,Blow the fire,Puff!puff!puff!” she sang, laughing."
"他冲她笑了笑。","He smiled at her."
"她因为那对耳环开心极了。","She was so glad because of her pearl ear-rings."
"吃早餐的时候，她变得严肃起来。他并没有注意到。她装出一副事态严重的样子。那几乎要穿透他一贯的好脾气去激怒他。","Over the breakfast she grew serious.He did not notice.She became portentous in her gravity.Almost it penetrated through his steady good-humour to irritate him."
"“泰德！”她终于开口说道。","“Teddy!” she said at last."
"“什么事？”他问道。","“What?” he asked."
"“我对你撒了个谎。”她楚楚可怜地说道。","“I told you a lie,” she said, humbly tragic."
"他的心情焦躁不安起来。","His soul stirred uneasily."
"“哦，是吗？”他漫不经心地答道。","“Oh aye?” he said casually."
"她对此感到不满。他应该更有所触动才对。","She was not satisfied.He ought to be more moved."
"“是的。”她回答说。","“Yes,” she said."
"他切了一片面包。","He cut a piece of bread."
"“是好事吗？”他问道。","“Was it a good one?” he asked."
"她生气了。然后她想了想——这“算是”件好事吗？然后她笑了笑。","She was piqued.Then she considered—WAS it a good one?Then she laughed."
"“不是，”她答道，“不算什么高兴的事。”","“No,” she said, “it wasn’t up to much.”"
"“哎呀！”他轻松地答道，但语气里流露出对她一贯的喜爱，“那样的话，就别提了。”","“Ah!” he said easily, but with a steady strength of fondness for her in his tone.“Get it out then.”"
"交谈变得有些难以继续下去。","It became a little more difficult."
"“你是知道那只白丝袜的，”她认真地说道，“我对你撒谎了。那不是一只样品。而是一件情人节礼物。”","“You know that white stocking,” she said earnestly.“I told you a lie.It wasn’t a sample.It was a valentine.”"
"他眉头微皱。","A little frown came on his brow."
"“那你为什么编造说它是样品？”他问。","“Then what did you invent it as a sample for?” he said."
"他了解她的弱点。他那带着些许愤怒的声音令她感到惧怕。","But he knew this weakness of hers.The touch of anger in his voice frightened her."
"“我是担心你生气。”她可怜兮兮地说道。","“I was afraid you’d be cross,” she said pathetically."
"“我知道你非常害怕。”他说。","“I’ll bet you were vastly afraid,” he said."
"“我是很怕，泰德。”","“I WAS, Teddy.”"
"他们的交谈间断了一会儿。他脑子里正在思考几件事情。","There was a pause.He was resolving one or two things in his mind."
"“那是谁送的？”他问道。","“And who sent it?” he asked."
"“我可以猜一猜，”她说，“尽管上边一个字都没有——除了——”","“I can guess,” she said, “though there wasn’t a word with it—except—”"
"她跑到起居室里拿了一张纸回来。","She ran to the sitting-room and returned with a slip of paper."
"“珍珠也许美丽，但你却更美丽。为我戴上它们吧，我会爱上那位佩戴者。”","“Pearls may be fair, but thou art fairer.Wear these for me, and I’ll love the wearer.”"
"他读了两遍，脸涨得通红。","He read it twice, then a dull red flush came on his face."
"“那你猜会是谁？”他带着生气的口吻问道。","“And WHO do you guess it is?” he asked, with a ringing of anger in his voice."
"“我猜是萨姆·亚当斯。”她有些义愤地说道。","“I suspect it’s Sam Adams,” she said, with a little virtuous indignation."
"惠斯顿沉默了一会儿。","Whiston was silent for a moment."
"“笨蛋！”他说道。","“Fool!” he said."
"“关珍珠什么事？——而且珍珠耳环就只有一只，他怎么能说‘为我戴上它们’？他根本就缺脑子，写不出正确的诗。”","“An’ what’s it got to do with pearls?—and how can he say ‘wear these for me’ when there’s only one?He hasn’t got the brain to invent a proper verse.”"
"他把纸拧成一团，丢到火里。","He screwed the sup of paper into a ball and flung it into the fire."
"“我猜他是觉得这和去年的一起正好凑成一对。”她说道。","“I suppose he thinks it’ll make a pair with the one last year,” she said."
"“什么，他去年也送了一只？”","“Why, did he send one then?”"
"“是的。那时我想你要是知道了一定会疯掉的。”","“Yes.I thought you’d be wild if you knew.”"
"他双颌紧闭，阴沉着脸。","His jaw set rather sullenly."
"不一会儿他站了起来，卷起袖子，解开衬衫敞着胸口，去把自己洗洗干净。他俊朗的外表、分明的鬓角、坚定的眼神仿佛都因脸下部分那冷酷的表情而削弱了。但她就是喜欢。她来回跑动，把桌子收拾干净。她喜欢他站着冲洗的样子。他就是这样一个人。她喜欢看他冲洗脖子时，脖子上水亮发光的样子。这使她觉得既有趣，又开心，又激动。长久以来，他都很确信自己完全主宰着她。这给她一种愉快而又有害的自由感。在他的掌控之下，她可以兴奋地四处乱窜。","Presently he rose, and went to wash himself, rolling back his sleeves and pulling open his shirt at the breast.It was as if his fine, clear-cut temples and steady eyes were degraded by the lower, rather brutal part of his face.But she loved it.As she whisked about, clearing the table, she loved the way in which he stood washing himself.He was such a man.She liked to see his neck glistening with water as he swilled it.It amused her and pleased her and thrilled her.He was so sure, so permanent, he had her so utterly in his power.It gave her a delightful, mischievous sense of liberty.Within his grasp, she could dart about excitingly."
"他转过身去面向她。他的脸受冷水的刺激而发红，他湛蓝的眼睛清澈透亮。","He turned round to her, his face red from the cold water, his eyes fresh and very blue."
"“你一直都没见过他吧，对不对？”他粗鲁地问道。","“You haven’t been seeing anything of him, have you?” he asked roughly."
"“是的。”过了一会儿她回答道，就好像被抓了现行一样。“他跟着我进了电车，邀请我去皇家酒吧去喝杯咖啡和甜酒。”","“Yes,” she answered, after a moment, as if caught guilty.“He got into the tram with me, and he asked me to drink a coffee and a Benedictine in the Royal.”"
"“他用花言巧语让你很高兴，”他阴沉着脸问道，“是不是？”","“You’ve got it off fine and glib,” he said sullenly.“And did you?”"
"“是的。”她回答道，露出一副叛徒在行刑架前的表情。","“Yes,” she replied, with the air of a traitor before the rack."
"他一动不动地站在那里，血气上涌至脖颈和面部，看上去一副要发作的样子。","The blood came up into his neck and face, he stood motionless, dangerous."
"“天气寒冷，但到皇家酒吧去是很有趣的。”她说道。","“It was cold, and it was such fun to go into the Royal,” she said."
"“你会为了一包巧克力而和黑鬼一起出去。”他愤怒地、鄙夷地、略带苦涩地说道。他一反常态地与她拉远距离，把她与自己阻隔开来。","“You’d go off with a nigger for a packet of chocolate,” he said, in anger and contempt, and some bitterness.Queer how he drew away from her, cut her off from him."
"“泰德！——你太粗鲁了！”她喊道。","“Ted—how beastly!” she cried."
"“你很清楚——”她咬住嘴唇，脸涨得通红，眼里满是泪水。","“You know quite well—” She caught her lip, flushed, and the tears came to her eyes."
"他转过身去，把领带系上。她忙着自己的事，做出一副楚楚可怜的怪相，时不时有眼泪滴下。","He turned away, to put on his necktie.She went about her work, making a queer pathetic little mouth, down which occasionally dripped a tear."
"他已经准备好要出发了。他戴好帽子，把外套一直扣到了下巴底下，走过来吻她。他如果没有吻她就出门的话，一整天都会过得很难受。她任他亲吻着。她的脸颊被他吻得湿湿的，他的心在燃烧。她深深地刺痛了他的心。她却感觉受了委屈，不愿意原谅他。","He was ready to go.With his hat jammed down on his head, and his overcoat buttoned up to his chin, he came to kiss her.He would be miserable all the day if he went without.She allowed herself to be kissed.Her cheek was wet under his lips, and his heart burned.She hurt him so deeply.And she felt aggrieved, and did not quite forgive him."
"过了一会儿，她上楼去找耳环。它们躺在小抽屉里显得很讨人喜欢——很讨人喜欢！她心情大好地观察着它们，把它们戴在耳朵上，自我欣赏着。她摆出各种姿势，在镜子前时而微笑，时而哀伤，时而悲伤，时而得意，时而又祈求。她感觉非常快乐，也非常美丽。","In a moment she went upstairs to her ear-rings.Sweet they looked nestling in the little drawer—sweet!She examined them with voluptuous pleasure, she threaded them in her ears, she looked at herself, she posed and postured and smiled, and looked sad and tragic and winning and appealing, all in turn before the mirror.And she was happy, and very pretty."
"在家里，她整个上午都带着那对耳环。她能感觉到自己光彩照人，很有吸引力。她在猜想，面包师进来的时候，有没有注意到这些。所有商人离开她家的时候都喜形于色，兴高采烈的。他们都不自觉得喜欢上了这个令人开心的小美人，尽管她的举止没有什么可注意的。","She wore her ear-rings all morning, in the house.She was self-conscious, and quite brilliantly winsome, when the baker came, wondering if he would notice.All the tradesmen left her door with a glow in them, feeling elated, and unconsciously favouring the delightful little creature, though there had been nothing to notice in her behaviour."
"她一整天都很兴奋。她没有考虑过她的丈夫。她展开轻浮的小翅膀，却去不了任何地方的，他是她永远的原则。到了夜里，她就会像小鸡和咒语一样回到家里回到他的身边休息。","She was stimulated all the day.She did not think about her husband.He was the permanent basis from which she took these giddy little flights into nowhere.At night, like chickens and curses, she would come home to him, to roost."
"与此同时，惠斯顿，一个漂泊者，一家小公司里极受信任的台柱，正忙于工作。但他的心却总为她焦虑，他渴望内心安定，但却因为得不到安定而一直很紧张。","Meanwhile Whiston, a traveller and confidential support of a small firm, hastened about his work, his heart all the while anxious for her, yearning for surety, and kept tense by not getting it."
"第二章","CHAPTER 2"
"在结婚之前，她曾经是亚当斯花边厂仓库里的女工。萨姆·亚当斯是她的雇主。他四十岁，单身，身材结实，衣着讲究而华丽，留着棕色的大胡子，头发稀少。从他整洁而显眼的外表的其余部分来看，秃头很明显使他感到懊恼。他气宇不凡，有爱尔兰人血统。","She had been a warehouse girl in Adams’s lace factory before she was married.Sam Adams was her employer.He was a bachelor of forty, growing stout, a man well dressed and florid, with a large brown moustache and thin hair.From the rest of his well-groomed, showy appearance, it was evident his baldness was a chagrin to him.He had a good presence, and some Irish blood in his veins."
"他因沉迷女子，或女子沉迷于他而臭名昭著。埃尔西是个伶俐、漂亮、说话近乎风趣的小可爱——她看上去说话很风趣，尽管她翻来覆去说的都是些完全微不足道的事情——她对他却有极大的吸引力。他会穿着一件浅黄褐色的双排扣的、带有运动气质的上衣，扣眼上还有一只鲜红色的康乃馨，一条黑白格子的上等裤子，戴上一顶帽舌很长的帽子来到仓库，为的就是加深她对他的印象。但她对他仅仅是略有印象。对她的高档品味而言，他的穿着太花哨了。他本能地察觉到了这点，就换成了一身稳重些的海军蓝色西服。这样一来，他就成了一个体格健硕、衣着华丽的人。他留着棕色大胡子，身着帅气的海军蓝色西服，脚穿时髦靴子，头戴男人味十足的帽子，简直无可挑剔。埃尔西对此印象深刻。","His fondness for the girls, or the fondness of the girls for him, was notorious.And Elsie, quick, pretty, almost witty little thing—she SEEMED witty, although, when her sayings were repeated, they were entirely trivial—she had a great attraction for him.He would come into the warehouse dressed in a rather sporting reefer coat, of fawn colour, and trousers of fine black-and-white check, a cap with a big peak and a scarlet carnation in his button-hole, to impress her.She was only half impressed.He was too loud for her good taste.Instinctively perceiving this, he sobered down to navy blue.Then a well-built man, florid, with large brown whiskers, smart navy blue suit, fashionable boots, and manly hat, he was the irreproachable.Elsie was impressed."
"但与此同时，惠斯顿正在追求她。她在卧室的镜子前做出好看的表示永久真实的小姿势。","But meanwhile Whiston was courting her, and she made splendid little gestures, before her bedroom mirror, of the constant-and-true sort."
"“真实，真实直到死亡——”","“True, true till death—”"
"那是她经常唱的歌。惠斯顿一直都是那个样子，所以没有必要为他担心。","That was her song.Whiston was made that way, so there was no need to take thought for him."
"每年的圣诞节，萨姆·亚当斯都会在自己家里举办一个晚会，邀请的都是他的高级雇员们——不是那些蓝领工人们而是上边的那些高级雇员们。他是个慷慨的人，有着一种能给人带来快乐的真正热情。","Every Christmas Sam Adams gave a party at his house, to which he invited his superior work-people—not factory hands and labourers, but those above.He was a generous man in his way, with a real warm feeling for giving pleasure."
"埃尔西最后一次参加这样的晚会是在两年前。惠斯顿陪着她一起参加的。那时候，他为萨姆·亚当斯工作。","Two years ago Elsie had attended this Christmas-party for the last time.Whiston had accompanied her.At that time he worked for Sam Adams."
"她身穿蓝色丝绸面料的紧身长礼服，感到十分得意。惠斯顿来接她。她把山羊绒大披肩围在胸前，轻快地走在他旁边。他则大步向前，潇洒地把裤子扎在靴子里。他的长大衣口袋被她的丝质鞋子塞得满满的。","She had been very proud of herself, in her close-fitting, full-skirted dress of blue silk.Whiston called for her.Then she tripped beside him, holding her large cashmere shawl across her breast.He strode with long strides, his trousers handsomely strapped under his boots, and her silk shoes bulging the pockets of his full-skirted overcoat."
"他们经过公园门口时，她的情绪变得高涨起来。在他们前面，夜里的罗克堡显得气势宏大。林阴大道两侧，光秃秃的树木静静地排列开来，在霜冻的笼罩下显得十分昏暗。","They passed through the park gates, and her spirits rose.Above them the Castle Rock looked grandly in the night, the naked trees stood still and dark in the frost, along the boulevard."
"他们到得相当晚。她期望中带着些不安。在衣帽间里，她摘下披肩，穿上丝质鞋子，对着镜子自照。她脸颊两侧那几束松散的卷发优雅地飘舞着，嘴角露出笑意。","They were rather late.Agitated with anticipation, in the cloak-room she gave up her shawl, donned her silk shoes, and looked at herself in the mirror.The loose bunches of curls on either side her face danced prettily, her mouth smiled."
"她在这个灯火通明的房间门口停了一会儿。许多人都在灯光的闪耀下来回穿梭。在枝形水晶吊灯的下面，女人们的长晚礼服摇摆飘动着，而长着连鬓胡子、系着白色领结的男人则在向她们鞠躬。然后她走进了灯光之下。","She hung a moment in the door of the brilliantly lighted room.Many people were moving within the blaze of lamps, under the crystal chandeliers, the full skirts of the women balancing and floating, the side-whiskers and white cravats of the men bowing above.Then she entered the light."
"萨姆·亚当斯立刻就走上前来，高举着双臂，对她表示热烈的欢迎。他红润的脸上总是带着微笑。","In an instant Sam Adams was coming forward, lifting both his arms in boisterous welcome.There was a constant red laugh on his face."
"“你来晚了，是不是？”他喊道，“像个贵族一样。”","“Come late, would you,” he shouted, “like royalty.”"
"他抓起她的手，领着她向前走。他说话的时候嘴张得很大，这就把棕色胡子背后的那种温暖而又隐蔽的效果给破坏了。但是在他的搀扶下，她轻盈地进了人群。他非常殷勤。","He seized her hands and led her forward.He opened his mouth wide when he spoke, and the effect of the warm, dark opening behind the brown whiskers was disturbing.But she was floating into the throng on his arm.He was very gallant."
"“那么现在，”他一边拿起她的请柬写下舞曲的名字一边说道，“我可以全权处理的，对不对？”","“Now then,” he said, taking her card to write down the dances, “I’ve got carte blanche, haven’t I?”"
"“惠斯顿先生不跳舞。”她说。","“Mr Whiston doesn’t dance,” she said."
"“我很幸运啊！”他一边潦草地写着自己名字的首字母一边说道。","“I am a lucky man!” he said, scribbling his initials."
"“我嘴里的风流韵事是与生俱来的。”","“I was born with an amourette in my mouth.”"
"他安静了下来，继续写着。她满脸通红地笑着，不知道那是什么意思。","He wrote on, quietly.She blushed and laughed, not knowing what it meant."
"“呵，那是什么？”她问道。","“Why, what is that?” she said."
"“是你，甚至比你还小，还带着小翅膀。”他答道。","“It’s you, even littler than you are, dressed in little wings,” he said."
"“那我得变得相当小才能被放进你嘴里。”她说。","“I should have to be pretty small to get in your mouth,” she said."
"“你认为自己太大了，是吗？”他轻松地说道。","“You think you’re too big, do you!” he said easily."
"他把请柬递给了她，并向她鞠了一躬。","He handed her her card, with a bow."
"“现在，我已经为今晚做好了准备，我的宝贝。”他说道。","“Now I’m set up, my darling, for this evening,” he said."
"接着，他像往常一样，迅速而又自在地环顾了一下屋子。她在他面前等待着。他已经准备好了。他看见乐队后，朝他们点了下头。音乐瞬间响起。他看上去很放松，似乎忘记了自我。","Then, quick, always at his ease, he looked over the room.She waited in front of him.He was ready.Catching the eye of the band, he nodded.In a moment, the music began.He seemed to relax, giving himself up."
"“喂，埃尔西。”他叫道，声音里带着一种奇怪的爱抚。这种爱抚似乎使她的身体沉浸在温暖和美妙之中。她沉湎于其中。她喜欢这样。","“Now then, Elsie,” he said, with a curious caress in his voice that seemed to lap the outside of her body in a warm glow, delicious.She gave herself to it.She liked it."
"他的舞跳得相当出色。","He was an excellent dancer."
"他似乎在用一种男性的热情来吸引她靠近他。他把她拥在身边，两人步伐一致，她的身体柔软了下来，随着他的脚步而动。她激情澎湃，热血沸腾，双脚不由自主地移动着，只有音乐会把她从他身边甩开又拉回到他的怀抱。在节奏感分明的音乐里，他强壮的身体与她狂乱地触碰。","He seemed to draw her close in to him by some male warmth of attraction, so that she became all soft and pliant to him, flowing to his form, whilst he united her with him and they lapsed along in one movement.She was just carried in a kind of strong, warm flood, her feet moved of themselves, and only the music threw her away from him, threw her back to him, to his clasp, in his strong form moving against her, rhythmically, deliriously."
"当乐曲结束的时候，他很高兴，眼里有一种令她兴奋的奇异光芒，但却与她无关。但那扣住了她的心弦。他没有跟她说话。他只是用一种奇异的闪亮的目光直视着她的眼睛，令她既畏惧又兴奋。但他的表情里无意间还带有那种放荡男人的嘲笑。这让她心里有点凉飕飕的。她没有失去自制力。","When it was over, he was pleased and his eyes had a curious gleam which thrilled her and yet had nothing to do with her.Yet it held her.He did not speak to her.He only looked straight into her eyes with a curious, gleaming look that disturbed her fearfully and deliriously.But also there was in his look some of the automatic irony of the roué.It left her partly cold.She was not carried away."
"她被一种相反的、更为强烈的冲动所驱使，朝着惠斯顿走去。他站在那里，表情沮丧，试图说服自己她不在他身边也完全有权利过得很愉快。他以相当勉强的善意迎接她。","She went, driven by an opposite, heavier impulse, to Whiston.He stood looking gloomy, trying to admit that she had a perfect right to enjoy herself apart from him.He received her with rather grudging kindliness."
"“你没去打惠斯特纸牌吗？”她问道。","“Aren’t you going to play whist?” she asked."
"“恩，”他答道，“马上就去。”","“Aye,” he said.“Directly.”"
"“我真希望你会跳舞。”","“I do wish you could dance.”"
"“唉，可是我不会。”他说，“你自己好好玩吧。”","“Well, I can’t,” he said.“So you enjoy yourself.”"
"“但如果能和你一起跳舞的话，我会更开心的。”","“But I should enjoy it better if I could dance with you.”"
"“不会啊，没关系的，”他说，“我不是跳舞的料。”","“Nay, you’re all right,” he said.“I’m not made that way.”"
"“你本来该是的！”她叫道。","“Then you ought to be!” she cried."
"“好吧，是我不好，不是你不好。你好好玩吧。”他跟她道别。她继续去跳舞了，但是有些生气。","“Well, it’s my fault, not yours.You enjoy yourself,” he bade her.Which she proceeded to do, a little bit irked."
"当到了与萨姆·亚当斯共舞的时候，她满怀期望地投入到他的怀抱。抛开这个人不说，跳舞确实令她非常愉快。她也有点埋怨惠斯顿。但当萨姆·亚当斯把她揽到身边，将她拥入美好的怀抱时，她便把他抛之脑后了。","She went with anticipation to the arms of Sam Adams, when the time came to dance with him.It WAS so gratifying, irrespective of the man.And she felt a little grudge against Whiston, soon forgotten when her host was holding her near to him, in a delicious embrace."
"她注视着他的他的眼睛，看到了眼睛里闪烁着的光芒，这光芒让她很满足。","And she watched his eyes, to meet the gleam in them, which gratified her."
"顿时，她全身发热，喜悦的心情渗透全身，使她忘记了其他所有事情。","She was getting warmed right through, the glow was penetrating into her, driving away everything else."
"只是在她内心还有一丝紧张，似乎是良心。","Only in her heart was a little tightness, like conscience."
"一找到机会，她就从舞厅逃到棋牌室。那里烟雾缭绕。她发现惠斯顿正在玩克里比奇牌。满面春风、兴奋不已、兴致勃勃的她向他走去，跟他打招呼。","When she got a chance, she escaped from the dancing-room to the card-room.There, in a cloud of smoke, she found Whiston playing cribbage.Radiant, roused, animated, she came up to him and greeted him."
"在这个安静的房间里，她十分惹眼活泼。他抬起头，阴沉的前额上眉头紧蹙。","She was too strong, too vibrant a note in the quiet room.He lifted his head, and a frown knitted his gloomy forehead."
"“你是在玩克里比奇牌吗？好玩吗？你玩得怎么样了？”她喋喋不休地问道。","“Are you playing cribbage?Is it exciting?How are you getting on?” she chattered."
"他看着她。这些问题没有一个需要回答，他也觉得这和她没什么关系。她转过身朝向牌板。","He looked at her.None of these questions needed answering, and he did not feel in touch with her.She turned to the cribbage-board."
"“你是白色的还是红色的？”她问道。","“Are you white or red?” she asked."
"“他是红的。”他的同伴回答道。","“He’s red,” replied the partner."
"“那你输定了。”她仍然对着惠斯顿说道。她拿起牌板上的红色木签。“一——二——三——四——五——六——七——八——你就应该跳到这儿——”","“Then you’re losing,” she said, still to Whiston.And she lifted the red peg from the board.“One—two—three—four—five—six—seven—eight—Right up there you ought to jump—”"
"“现在把它放回到原位。”惠斯顿说道。","“Now put it back in its right place,” said Whiston."
"“它原来在哪里来着？”她知道自己过分了，嬉皮笑脸地说道。","“Where was it?” she asked gaily, knowing her transgression."
"他从她手中把小小的红色木签拿走，放到它该在的孔里。","He took the little red peg away from her and stuck it in its hole."
"牌局被搅乱了。","The cards were shuffled."
"“真糟糕，你输了！”埃尔西感慨道。","“What a shame you’re losing!” said Elsie."
"“你最好帮他切牌。”他同伴说道。","“You’d better cut for him,” said the partner."
"她马上就那么做了。牌发好了。她看着他的牌，把手臂搭在他的肩膀上。","She did so, hastily.The cards were dealt.She put her hand on his shoulder, looking at his cards."
"“牌很好，对不对？”她说道。","“It’s good,” she cried, “isn’t it?”"
"他并没有回答，而是扔下两张牌。她把手搭在他的肩膀上，卷发碰着他的耳朵边摇晃着，这使他感到很强烈的触动，不仅仅是舒服而已，而她却为另一个男人而兴奋。这使他血脉喷张。","He did not answer, but threw down two cards.It moved him more strongly than was comfortable, to have her hand on his shoulder, her curls dangling and touching his ears, whilst she was roused to another man.It made the blood flame over him."
"就在那个时候，萨姆·亚当斯出现了。他衣着华丽，吵吵嚷嚷的，自我陶醉，沉浸于跳舞甚于美酒。","At that moment Sam Adams appeared, florid and boisterous, intoxicated more with himself, with the dancing, than with wine."
"他的眼里闪烁着奇异冷静的光亮。","In his eyes the curious, impersonal light gleamed."
"“我就知道能在这里找到你，埃尔西。”他兴高采烈地嚷道，声音高亢刺耳。","“I thought I should find you here, Elsie,” he cried boisterously, a disturbing, high note in his voice."
"“你为什这么觉得？”她调皮地问道。","“What made you think so?” she replied, the mischief rousing in her."
"这个衣着华丽，体格健硕的人把眼睛眯成了一条缝，笑了。","The florid, well-built man narrowed his eyes to a smile."
"“我永远都不应该到女人堆里去找你。”他说道，话语里带着一种肉欲的亲密。他笑着向她鞠了个躬，伸出他的手。","“I should never look for you among the ladies,” he said, with a kind of intimate, animal call to her.He laughed, bowed, and offered her his arm."
"“小姐，音乐在等着呢。”","“Madam, the music waits.”"
"她几乎无助地被他簇拥而去，并不情愿，但心里很是高兴。","She went almost helplessly, carried along with him, unwilling, yet delighted."
"跳舞对她来是件很令人陶醉的事情。刚迈了几步，她就感觉迷失了自我。她知道她在跟着他跳着，即使她不想。但是她别无选择。靠在这个正与她跳舞的、既稳重又亲密男人的臂弯里，她好像和整个房间失去了联系，与他融为一体了。她已经渐渐变成他的一部分，不可缺少的隐私。","That dance was an intoxication to her.After the first few steps, she felt herself slipping away from herself.She almost knew she was going, she did not even want to go.Yet she must have chosen to go.She lay in the arm of the steady, close man with whom she was dancing, and she seemed to swim away out of contact with the room, into him.She had passed into another, denser element of him, an essential privacy."
"她周围的房间一片模糊，像在空中，又像是在海底。周围的人就像幽灵一样悄无声息地移动着。只有她自己被舞伴真实地簇拥着，她和他仿佛密不可分，就好像他身体四肢的移动就是她自己在移动似的，尽管事实上不是——哦，太美妙了！他也在不知不觉中迷失了自我，全神贯注地跳着舞。他对周围的事物视而不见。","The room was all vague around her, like an atmosphere, like under sea, with a flow of ghostly, dumb movements.But she herself was held real against her partner, and it seemed she was connected with him, as if the movements of his body and limbs were her own movements, yet not her own movements—and oh, delicious!He also was given up, oblivious, concentrated, into the dance.His eye was unseeing."
"健硕而好色的他对她做了些小动作。他的手好像在她身上乱摸。每时每刻，每时每刻她都能感觉到自己被彻底征服了，熔化了：她的双脚和双膝都松软到失去意识时就是达到熔点的时刻了。舞曲中，他带着她在房间里转来转去，似乎在用身体和四肢来支撑她的全部重量，他的热情仿佛进一步感染了她，直到把她全身熔化。到那时，她对他来说就像液体般滑软，是种令人陶醉的东西罢了。","Only his large, voluptuous body gave off a subtle activity.His fingers seemed to search into her flesh.Every moment, and every moment, she felt she would give way utterly, and sink molten: the fusion point was coming when she would fuse down into perfect unconsciousness at his feet and knees.But he bore her round the room in the dance, and he seemed to sustain all her body with his limbs, his body, and his warmth seemed to come closer into her, nearer, till it would fuse right through her, and she would be as liquid to him, as an intoxication only."
"这太美妙了。舞曲结束后，她有些眩晕，几乎喘不过气来。她和他一起站在房间的中央，就好像她独自呆在一个很偏远的地方。他向她鞠了个躬。她期望他会亲吻她那裸露的肩膀，她在等待着。然而，他们并不是在独处，这里并不是只有他们两个人。这太残酷了。","It was exquisite.When it was over, she was dazed, and was scarcely breathing.She stood with him in the middle of the room as if she were alone in a remote place.He bent over her.She expected his lips on her bare shoulder, and waited.Yet they were not alone, they were not alone.It was cruel."
"“舞跳得很美妙，是不是，我的宝贝？”他对她说，声音低沉而愉快。","“’Twas good, wasn’t it, my darling?” he said to her, low and delighted."
"他低沉而得意的声音奇怪而冷静，令她无可抗拒，十分着迷。然而她为什么又意识到了她内心的某个部分是紧闭的呢？她挽着他的胳膊，由他领着朝门边走去。","There was a strange impersonality about his low, exultant call that appealed to her irresistibly.Yet why was she aware of some part shut off in her?She pressed his arm, and he led her towards the door."
"她没有意识到自己在干什么，只是觉得心里有点抗拒的烦恼。这个着了魔似的男人表面看上去却沉着镇定，他挤过人群朝餐厅走去，似乎是为了让她恢复精力，实际上是想狡猾地开溜与她呆在一起。他欲火焚身但却用镇定来掩饰自己，内心对此却根本不相信。","She was not aware of what she was doing, only a little grain of resistant trouble was in her.The man, possessed, yet with a superficial presence of mind, made way to the dining-room, as if to give her refreshment, cunningly working to his own escape with her.He was molten hot, filmed over with presence of mind, and bottomed with cold disbelief."
"餐厅里，惠斯顿正端着咖啡走向僻静处，没有理会那些小姐太太们。埃尔西看到了他，但感觉他好像没看见她。她在他的视线之外，对他来说远不可及。她和身边这个大块头男人之间有种相互熔合的感觉。她吃着自己的牛奶沙司。在跟她的雇主一起的时间里，一种不完全的熔合感一直支持并控制着她。","In the dining-room was Whiston, carrying coffee to the plain, neglected ladies.Elsie saw him, but felt as if he could not see her.She was beyond his reach and ken.A sort of fusion existed between her and the large man at her side.She ate her custard, but an incomplete fusion all the while sustained and contained her within the being of her employer."
"但是她渐渐冷静了下来。惠斯顿走了过来。她看着他，用一种异样的眼光看着他。他修长而年轻的身形真实而持久地呈现在她的面前。那便是他。但她刚才却着了魔似的和别人在一起，并与他熔合，然而她并不会完全失去理智。","But she was growing cooler.Whiston came up.She looked at him, and saw him with different eyes.She saw his slim, young man’s figure real and enduring before her.That was he.But she was in the spell with the other man, fused with him, and she could not be taken away."
"“你打完牌了？”她匆忙地托辞性地问他。","“Have you finished your cribbage?” she asked, with hasty evasion of him."
"“是的，”他回答道，“你跳舞跳累了吧？”","“Yes,” he replied.“Aren’t you getting tired of dancing?”"
"“一点也没跳够。”她答道。","“Not a bit,” she said."
"“她才不会跳够呢，”亚当斯热忱地说道，“没有哪位姑娘会厌倦跳舞，只要她们还有一点力气——再吃点别的吧，埃尔西。嗨——来杯雪利酒。和我们一起喝杯雪利酒吧，惠斯顿。”","“Not she,” said Adams heartily.“No girl with any spirit gets tired of dancing.—Have something else, Elsie.Come—sherry.Have a glass of sherry with us, Whiston.”"
"他们品酒时，亚当斯几乎狡黠地看着惠斯顿，想发现他身上的优点。","Whilst they sipped the wine, Adams watched Whiston almost cunningly, to find his advantage."
"“我们最好回去——音乐已经响起了。”他说道。“照顾这些女士吃东西好吗，惠斯顿？会找到好顾客的。”","“We’d better be getting back—there’s the music,” he said.“See the women get something to eat, Whiston, will you, there’s a good chap.”"
"说完他就离开了。埃尔西不受控制地跟着他。但惠斯顿跟在他们身边，和他们一起去了。他们在一片沉默中穿过人群到了舞厅。在舞厅，亚当斯犹豫了，环顾了一下房间四周。就好像他看不见似的。","And he began to draw away.Elsie was drifting helplessly with him.But Whiston put himself beside them, and went along with them.In silence they passed through to the dancing-room.There Adams hesitated, and looked round the room.It was as if he could not see."
"一位男士匆忙地走了过来，邀请埃尔西跳舞。亚当斯便走向别的舞伴那了。他们跳舞时，惠斯顿站在一旁观看着。她意识到他站在那里观察着她，像一个幽灵，又像一名评委或者是一位守护天使。","A man came hurrying forward, claiming Elsie, and Adams went to his other partner.Whiston stood watching during the dance.She was conscious of him standing there observant of her, like a ghost, or a judgment, or a guardian angel."
"她还意识到那个与她无关但又更加亲密的人正在这个房间的某个地方移动着。","She was also conscious, much more intimately and impersonally, of the body of the other man moving somewhere in the room."
"她仍然属于他，但是一种心烦意乱的感觉和无助的感觉始终占据着她。亚当斯继续围绕在埃尔西身边跳舞，玩世不恭地坚持着，等着和她跳舞。","She still belonged to him, but a feeling of distraction possessed her, and helplessness.Adams danced on, adhering to Elsie, waiting his time, with the persistence of cynicism."
"舞曲结束了。亚当斯被舞伴缠住了。埃尔西发觉自己回到了惠斯顿的身边。","The dance was over.Adams was detained.Elsie found herself beside Whiston."
"他坐着的时候身形优美，她靠着他时，他的膝盖和清晰的曲线也很好看。他的身形仿佛能够永久保持。她把手搭在他的膝盖上。","There was something shapely about him as he sat, about his knees and his distinct figure, that she clung to.It was as if he had enduring form.She put her hand on his knee."
"“你玩得愉快吗？”他问道。","“Are you enjoying yourself?” he asked."
"“一直很开心。”她答道，语气显得很兴奋，却又很超然。","“EVER so,” she replied, with a fervent, yet detached tone."
"“晚会还要进行到凌晨一点。”他说。","“It’s going on for one o’clock,” he said."
"“是吗？”她回应道。","“Is it?” she answered."
"这对她来说没有任何意义。","It meant nothing to her."
"“我们该走了吧？”他问道。","“Should we be going?” he said."
"她沉默了。在这一个多小时里，她的正常意识头一次有回归的迹象。她恨这一切。","She was silent.For the first time for an hour or more an inkling of her normal consciousness returned.She resented it."
"“为什么？”她问道。","“What for?” she said."
"“我以为你可能玩够了。”他说道。","“I thought you might have had enough,” he said."
"她大脑里掠过一丝的清醒，她因幻想受挫而感到生气。","A slight soberness came over her, an irritation at being frustrated of her illusion."
"“为什么？”她问。","“Why?” she said."
"“我们九点就到这儿了。”他回答说。","“We’ve been here since nine,” he said."
"那对她来说不是答案，也不是理由。那对她毫无意义。她坐得离他远远的。房间的另一头，萨姆·亚当斯时不时地往她这里瞥一眼。她坐在那里，完全暴露在他的视线里。","That was no answer, no reason.It conveyed nothing to her.She sat detached from him.Across the room Sam Adams glanced at her.She sat there exposed for him."
"“你和萨姆·亚当斯不要太随便了，”他小心翼翼地说道，内心很痛苦，“你知道他是个什么样的人。”","“You don’t want to be too free with Sam Adams,” said Whiston cautiously, suffering.“You know what he is.”"
"“我怎么随便了？”她问道。","“How, free?” she asked."
"“总之——你不要跟他太纠缠不清。”","“Why—you don’t want to have too much to do with him.”"
"她沉默地坐在那里。他迫使她意识到了自己的境况。但是他无法捉摸她的感情，也无法改变。她居然任性地希望他不要改变她。","She sat silent.He was forcing her into consciousness of her position.But he could not get hold of her feelings, to change them.She had a curious, perverse desire that he should not."
"“我喜欢他。”她说。","“I like him,” she said."
"“你喜欢他哪？”他问道，心里怒火中烧。","“What do you find to like in him?” he said, with a hot heart."
"“我不知道——但我就是喜欢他。”她回答道。","“I don’t know—but I like him,” she said."
"她打定了主意。他坐在那里，心情沉重，气得麻木了。他并不清楚自己的感受。她跳舞时，他死气沉沉地坐在那里。","She was immutable.He sat feeling heavy and dulled with rage.He was not clear as to what he felt.He sat there unliving whilst she danced."
"而她则心烦意乱，迷失在这两个男人相对立的力量之中，摇摆不定。跳舞间歇里，惠斯顿一直离她很近。但她几乎没有察觉到。她不断地盯着跳舞卡，有些渴望又有些紧张，想看看她什么时候可以再和亚当斯一起跳舞。有时当她跳舞经过他旁边时，她迎上他那坚定的蓝绿色眼睛。有时当他跳舞的时候，她能看到他舞姿矫健的侧影。就好像她总是倚靠在他的手臂上，被他带着旋转、上举，迷失了自我似的。但现实总是相反的。她感到很矛盾了。","And she, distracted, lost to herself between the opposing forces of the two men, drifted.Between the dances, Whiston kept near to her.She was scarcely conscious.She glanced repeatedly at her card, to see when she would dance again with Adams, half in desire, half in dread.Sometimes she met his steady, glaucous eye as she passed him in the dance.Sometimes she saw the steadiness of his flank as he danced.And it was always as if she rested on his arm, were borne along, upborne by him, away from herself.And always there was present the other’s antagonism.She was divided."
"和亚当斯一起跳舞的时间终于到了。哦，与他的紧密接触真是美妙！他的身体触碰着她的身体，他的手臂支撑着她的手臂。她似乎感觉到了。惠斯顿从来没有让她有过如此真实美妙的感觉。在她的意识里，他只不过是个负担。","The time came for her to dance with Adams.Oh, the delicious closing of contact with him, of his limbs touching her limbs, his arm supporting her.She seemed to resolve.Whiston had not made himself real to her.He was only a heavy place in her consciousness."
"她呼吸急促，开始受到亲密无间带来的压力的折磨。她十分紧张。亚当斯也有些拘谨。一种不自在的紧张的感觉向他们两个袭来。","But she breathed heavily, beginning to suffer from the closeness of strain.She was nervous.Adams also was constrained.A tightness, a tension was coming over them all."
"他被激怒了，感觉有种反作用力在对抗他肉欲的吸引，感觉到一种比他还强烈的愿望在干涉着最重要的欲求。","And he was exasperated, feeling something counteracting physical magnetism, feeling a will stronger with her than his own, intervening in what was becoming a vital necessity to him."
"埃尔西几乎失去了自控力。当她随着他走到跳舞的位置上时，她弯下腰去拿她的手帕。","Elsie was almost lost to her own control.As she went forward with him to take her place at the dance, she stooped for her pocket-handkerchief."
"四对舞的音乐响起。大家都准备好了。亚当斯站得离她很近，想要吸引她。他很紧张好斗。她弯下身去拿手帕，起身的时候把它抖了抖。手帕被抖了出来，从她手里掉落。当她发现自己错把白丝袜当成手帕带了过来时，很恼怒。缠绕的白丝袜转眼间便掉到了地板上。亚当斯迅速地将它捡起，略微有些惊讶，嘴角泛起了胜利的微笑。","The music sounded for quadrilles.Everybody was ready.Adams stood with his body near her, exerting his attraction over her.He was tense and fighting.She stooped for her pocket-handkerchief, and shook it as she rose.It shook out and fell from her hand.With agony, she saw she had taken a white stocking instead of a handkerchief.For a second it lay on the floor, a twist of white stocking.Then, in an instant, Adams picked it up, with a little, surprised laugh of triumph."
"“那是故意做给我看的。”他低声说道——就好像要占有她似的。他把丝袜塞进他的裤子口袋里，又迅速地递上他的手帕。","“That’ll do for me,” he whispered—seeming to take possession of her.And he stuffed the stocking in his trousers pocket, and quickly offered her his handkerchief."
"舞曲开始了。她感觉到一阵虚弱和眩晕，就好像她的意志化成了水一样。一阵沉重的失落感掠过她的心头。她再也不能自抑了。但一切总算相安无事。","The dance began.She felt weak and faint, as if her will were turned to water.A heavy sense of loss came over her.She could not help herself anymore.But it was peace."
"舞曲结束，亚当斯松开了她。惠斯顿向她走来。","When the dance was over, Adams yielded her up.Whiston came to her."
"““你掉的那是什么东西？”惠斯顿问道。","“What was it as you dropped?” Whiston asked."
"“我以为那是手帕——我错拿成了丝袜了。”她漠然答道，声音微小。","“I thought it was my handkerchief—I’d taken a stocking by mistake,” she said, detached and muted."
"“然后他拿走了？”","“And he’s got it?”"
"“是的。”","“Yes.”"
"“他那样做什么意思？”","“What does he mean by that?”"
"她耸了耸肩。","She lifted her shoulders."
"“你打算让他留着那个吗？”他问道。“我没想让他留着。”","“Are you going to let him keep it?” he asked.“I don’t let him.”"
"很长时间，他俩没有说话。","There was a long pause."
"“要不要我去向他要回来？”他问道，脸色通红，蓝色的眼睛显得越来越锐利。“不用了。”她答道，面色苍白。","“Am I to go and have it out with him?” he asked, his face flushed, his blue eyes going hard with opposition.“No,” she said, pale."
"“为什么？”","“Why?”"
"“别说了——关于这件事，我不想再说什么。”","“No—I don’t want to say anything about it.”"
"他坐在那里，愤怒而不知所措。","He sat exasperated and nonplussed."
"“那么，你就让他留着那只丝袜？”他问道。她沉默地坐在那里，不做任何回答。","“You’ll let him keep it, then?” he asked.She sat silent and made no form of answer."
"“你那是什么意思？”他阴沉着脸，愤怒地说道。","“What do you mean by it?” he said, dark with fury."
"他猛然起身。","And he started up."
"“不要！”她哭着喊道。“泰德！”她紧紧抓住他，竭力不让他去。","“No!” she cried.“Ted!”And she caught hold of him, sharply detaining him."
"这令他怒不可遏。","It made him black with rage."
"“为什么？”他问道。","“Why?” he said."
"她嘴角的嚅动使他动了恻隐之心。他并不理解，但他觉得她这么做一定有她的理由。","Then something about her mouth was pitiful to him.He did not understand, but he felt she must have her reasons."
"“那好吧，我不在这里呆着了，”他说，“你跟我一起走吗？”","“Then I’m not stopping here,” he said.“Are you coming with me?”"
"她站起身来，没有说话。他们一起离开了晚会。亚当斯没有注意到他们离开了。","She rose mutely, and they went out of the room.Adams had not noticed."
"不一会儿，他们就来到了街上。","In a few moments they were in the street."
"“你到底什么意思？”他暴跳如雷地问道。她走在他的旁边，一言不发，没有反应。","“What the hell do you mean?” he said, in a black fury.She went at his side, in silence, neutral."
"“那头猪。”他接着骂道。","“That great hog, an’ all,” he added."
"他们沉默地走了很长时间，穿过冰冷的荒芜而又昏暗的小镇。她觉得不能马上回家。他们离她家越来越近。","Then they went a long time in silence through the frozen, deserted darkness of the town.She felt she could not go indoors.They were drawing near her house."
"“我不想回家，”她突然极为痛苦地哭着说道，“我不想回家。”","“I don’t want to go home,” she suddenly cried in distress and anguish.“I don’t want to go home.”"
"他看着她。","He looked at her."
"“你为什么不想回家？”他问道。","“Why don’t you?” he said."
"“我不想回家。”这是抽泣的她唯一能说出来的话。","“I don’t want to go home,” was all she could sob."
"他听到有人过来了。","He heard somebody coming."
"“好吧，我们还可以走得远一些。”他说道。","“Well, we can walk a bit further,” he said."
"她又陷入了沉默。他们穿过小镇走进了田野里。他挽着她的手臂——他们没有说话。","She was silent again.They passed out of the town into the fields.He held her by the arm—they could not speak."
"“你怎么了？”他终于问了出来，心中满是疑惑。","“What’s a-matter?” he asked at length, puzzled."
"她又开始哭了起来。","She began to cry again."
"最后，他把她抱入怀里来安慰她。她自顾自地抽泣着，几乎忘记了他的存在。","At last he took her in his arms, to soothe her.She sobbed by herself, almost unaware of him."
"“告诉我是怎么一回事，埃尔西，”他说道，“快告诉我是怎么一回事——宝贝儿——快告诉我。”","“Tell me what’s a-matter, Elsie,” he said.“Tell me what’s a-matter—my dear—tell me, then—”"
"他亲吻着她那哭湿了的脸颊并抚摸着她。她没有回应。他一脸困惑，看上去温柔而痛苦。","He kissed her wet face, and caressed her.She made no response.He was puzzled and tender and miserable."
"最终，她平静了下来。接着，他又亲吻了她，她搂住他，紧紧地依偎在他怀里，就好像很害怕很痛苦似的。他把她抱在怀里，心中满是疑惑。","At length she became quiet.Then he kissed her, and she put her arms round him, and clung to him very tight, as if for fear and anguish.He held her in his arms, wondering."
"“泰德！”她发狂似地低声叫道，“泰德！”","“Ted!” she whispered, frantic.“Ted!”"
"“怎么了，我的亲亲？”他问道，心里也开始害怕。","“What, my love?” he answered, becoming also afraid."
"“对我好些，”她哭着说道，“别对我残忍。”","“Be good to me,” she cried.“Don’t be cruel to me.”"
"“怎么会，我的宝贝。”他既吃惊又悲伤地回答道。“为什么这么说？”","“No, my pet,” he said, amazed and grieved.“Why?”"
"“哦，对我好些。”她抽泣地说道。","“Oh, be good to me,” she sobbed."
"他稳稳地抱着她，心中充满了对她炽热的爱。他仍然觉得吃惊。他能做的只是把她拥入炽热的怀里，爱并信任着她。最后，她终于恢复到了原来的状态。","And he held her very safe, and his heart was white-hot with love for her.His mind was amazed.He could only hold her against his chest that was white-hot with love and belief in her.So she was restored at last."
"第三章","CHAPTER 3"
"她拒绝再去亚当斯的工厂里工作。她父亲不得不屈服。她把辞呈交了上去——说身体不太好。萨姆·亚当斯感到很讽刺。但他却出奇地有耐心。他并未争论。","She refused to go to her work at Adams’s any more.Her father had to submit and she sent in her notice—she was not well.Sam Adams was ironical.But he had a curious patience.He did not fight."
"几周之后，埃尔西和惠斯顿结了婚。她爱他，既富有热情又饱含崇拜。她强烈的爱深深地打动了他，给他永久的保证，使他对自己有种真实的感觉。他没有再自寻烦恼：他感到很充实，现在他在这世上有很多事情都需要忙乎。不论什么事困扰着他，他心底都只有那份爱的保证。他发现自己沉醉在这份爱情之中。","In a few weeks, she and Whiston were married.She loved him with passion and worship, a fierce little abandon of love that moved him to the depths of his being, and gave him a permanent surety and sense of realness in himself.He did not trouble about himself any more: he felt he was fulfilled and now he had only the many things in the world to busy himself about.Whatever troubled him, at the bottom was surety.He had found himself in this love."
"他们曾经谈到过那只白丝袜一两次。","They spoke once or twice of the white stocking."
"“啊！”惠斯顿大声喊道，“那有什么关系吗？”","“Ah!” Whiston exclaimed.“What does it matter?”"
"他既不耐烦又生气，无法忍受再想起这件事。所以这件事情搁置了下来没有解决。","He was impatient and angry, and could not bear to consider the matter.So it was left unresolved."
"刚开始，她非常开心，对丈夫的爱慕冲昏了头脑。后来，她渐渐地对他习以为常了。他一直是她幸福的土壤，但她对他已经习以为常了，就好像呼吸的空气一样。他却从来没有像她那样对她习以为常。","She was quite happy at first, carried away by her adoration of her husband.Then gradually she got used to him.He always was the ground of her happiness, but she got used to him, as to the air she breathed.He never got used to her in the same way."
"她发现在婚姻里，自己很自由。她摆脱了自己的责任。她的丈夫必须为此尽责。她可以随心所欲地做自己想做的任何事情。","Inside of marriage she found her liberty.She was rid of the responsibility of herself.Her husband must look after that.She was free to get what she could out of her time."
"以至于几个月后，她遇到萨姆·亚当斯时，对他并没有原来想象中的那么不友善。","So that, when, after some months, she met Sam Adams, she was not quite as unkind to him as she might have been."
"凭着年轻妻子对男人的新的、令人兴奋的认识，她察觉到，他爱着她。她知道他对她一直有种未被满足的欲望。她觉得有趣，就忍不住利用这点和他玩玩，尽管她对他本人一点也不在乎。","With a young wife’s new and exciting knowledge of men, she perceived he was in love with her, she knew he had always kept an unsatisfied desire for her.And, sportive, she could not help playing a little with this, though she cared not one jot for the man himself."
"情人节到来时，他们的结婚周年纪念日也快要到了，她收到了一只白丝袜和一枚紫水晶胸针。","When Valentine’s day came, which was near the first anniversary of her wedding day, there arrived a white stocking with a little amethyst brooch."
"幸运的是，惠斯顿并没有看见，所以她也就对他只字未提。她一点都没想过要和萨姆·亚当斯有任何瓜葛。但一旦这枚小小的胸针到她手里，就归她所有了，她根本就不会去想她是怎么得到它的。她把它留下了。","Luckily Whiston did not see it, so she said nothing of it to him.She had not the faintest intention of having anything to do with Sam Adams, but once a little brooch was in her possession, it was hers, and she did not trouble her head for a moment how she had come by it.She kept it."
"现在她又收到了对珍珠耳环。这份礼物更贵重，更显眼。为了解释它们的来由，她要说是她母亲给她的。她在脑袋里制定出了这个简单的计划。她格外地满意。至于萨姆·亚当斯，即便是他看到她戴着它们，也不会拆穿她。要是他看到她戴着他送的耳环，那该多么有趣啊！她要假装它们是从她外婆，也就是她妈妈的妈妈那里遗传下来的。下午，她笑容满面进城去，那对漂亮的耳环在她的卷发前悬荡着。但是她没有看到重要的人。","Now she had the pearl ear-rings.They were a more valuable and a more conspicuous present.She would have to ask her mother to give them to her, to explain their presence.She made a little plan in her head.And she was extraordinarily pleased.As for Sam Adams, even if he saw her wearing them, he would not give her away.What fun, if he saw her wearing his ear-rings!She would pretend she had inherited them from her grandmother, her mother’s mother.She laughed to herself as she went down town in the afternoon, the pretty drops dangling in front of her curls.But she saw no one of importance."
"惠斯顿疲惫而沮丧地回到了家里。一整天，他体内的雄性激素都不稳定，令他感到疲惫。她好奇地想和他对着干，取笑他，嘲讽他，不理睬他，正如以前一样。他不明白这是为什么，但他被深深地激怒了。她在他面前不安定。","Whiston came home tired and depressed.All day the male in him had been uneasy, and this had fatigued him.She was curiously against him, inclined, as she sometimes was nowadays, to make mock of him and jeer at him and cut him off.He did not understand this, and it angered him deeply.She was uneasy before him."
"她知道他一直压抑着自己的愤怒。他额头深锁，手背上的青筋爆出。然而她却忍不住去刺激他。","She knew he was in a state of suppressed irritation.The veins stood out on the backs of his hands, his brow was drawn stiffly.Yet she could not help goading him."
"“你怎么处理那只白丝袜？”他打破令人沮丧的沉寂，用强硬冷酷的口气问道。","“What did you do wi’ that white stocking?” he asked, out of a gloomy silence, his voice strong and brutal."
"“我把它放到一个小抽屉里了——你为什么这样问？”她轻率地回答道。","“I put it in a drawer—why?” she replied flippantly."
"“你为什么不把马上把它退回去呢？”他厉声说道，","“Why didn’t you put it on the fire back?” he said harshly."
"“你还把它收起来做什么？”","“What are you hoarding it up for?”"
"“我不是把它收起来，”她回答说，“我已经有一对了。”","“I’m not hoarding it up,” she said.“I’ve got a pair.”"
"他再次陷入阴郁的沉默之中。她没有办法打动他，就见状跑到了楼上，留下他一人在炉火边抽烟。她又戴上了那对耳环。接着，她突然又有了一个小点子。她穿上了白丝袜，两只都穿上了。","He relapsed into gloomy silence.She, unable to move him, ran away upstairs, leaving him smoking by the fire.Again she tried on the earrings.Then another little inspiration came to her.She drew on the white stockings, both of them."
"过了一会儿，她穿着它们下了楼。她的丈夫仍然一动不动地坐在炉火旁，两眼发直。","Presently she came down in them.Her husband still sat immovable and glowering by the fire."
"“看啊！”她喊道，","“Look!” she said."
"“她们穿起来漂亮极了。”","“They’ll do beautifully.”"
"她把裙子提到膝盖，并转起圈来，看着自己那双穿着漂亮丝袜的美腿。","And she picked up her skirts to her knees, and twisted round, looking at her pretty legs in the neat stockings."
"他心中充满了无名的愤怒，把烟斗从嘴边拿开。","He filled with unreasonable rage, and took the pipe from his mouth."
"“它们很好看吧？”她说道， ","“Don’t they look nice?” she said."
"“去年收到一只，今年收到一只，正好一对。省得你去买一对了。”","“One from last year and one from this, they just do.Save you buying a pair.”"
"她顺着肩膀往下看她那漂亮的小腿，还有她那摇荡着的灯笼裤的折纹。","And she looked over her shoulders at her pretty calves, and the dangling frills of her knickers."
"“把裙子放下来，不要出洋相了。”他说道。","“Put your skirts down and don’t make a fool of yourself,” he said."
"“为什么是出洋相呢？”她问道。","“Why a fool of myself?” she asked."
"她在房间里慢慢地舞动起来，就像一名芭蕾舞演员似的，既胡闹又嘲弄地扬起她的双脚。近乎害怕，但又带着挑衅，她一边向他抬腿，一边嘴里还唱着歌。她对他有种愤怒。","And she began to dance slowly round the room, kicking up her feet half reckless, half jeering, in a ballet-dancer’s fashion.Almost fearfully, yet in defiance, she kicked up her legs at him, singing as she did so.She resented him."
"“你个小傻瓜，该结束了，”他说道，“我告诉你，你必须把丝袜退回去。”他生气了。他的脸涨得发紫，一直低着头。她停了下来，不再跳舞。","“You little fool, ha’ done with it,” he said.“And you’ll backfire them stockings, I’m telling you.”He was angry.His face flushed dark, he kept his head bent.She ceased to dance."
"“我不，”她拒绝道，“它们会很有用的。”","“I shan’t,” she said.“They’ll come in very useful.”"
"他抬起头盯着她，目露凶光。","He lifted his head and watched her, with lighted, dangerous eyes."
"“把它们退回去，我告诉你。”他说。","“You’ll put ’em on the fire back, I tell you,” he said."
"现在演变成了一场战争。她像芭蕾舞演员一样身体前倾，吐了下舌头。","It was a war now.She bent forward, in a ballet-dancer’s fashion, and put her tongue between her teeth."
"“我不会把丝袜退回去的，”她重复着他的话，唱道，“我不会，我不会，我不会。”","“I shan’t backfire them stockings,” she sang, repeating his words, “I shan’t, I shan’t, I shan’t.”"
"她围着房间跳舞，随着话音做着大踢腿。她的行为带有一种刺人的无所谓。","And she danced round the room doing a high kick to the tune of her words.There was a real biting indifference in her behaviour."
"“那我就看看你到底会不会，”他说道，“荡妇！你想让萨姆·亚当斯知道你戴着它们，是不是？那样你就高兴了。”","“We’ll see whether you will or not,” he said, “trollops!You’d like Sam Adams to know you was wearing ’em, wouldn’t you?That’s what would please you.”"
"“没错，我想让他看到我戴那双耳环多么得合适，那样，他就可能送我更多礼物。”","“Yes, I’d like him to see how nicely they fit me, he might give me some more then.”"
"她说着低头看了看自己美丽的双腿。","And she looked down at her pretty legs."
"不知为什么，他觉得她乐意让萨姆·亚当斯看到她的双腿穿着白丝袜是多么漂亮。这让他更加生气，几乎到了仇恨的地步。","He knew somehow that she WOULD like Sam Adams to see how pretty her legs looked in the white stockings.It made his anger go deep, almost to hatred."
"“你这个下流的荡妇，”他喊道，","“Yer nasty trolley,” he cried."
"“把你的衬裙放下来，不要再这么肮脏下流了。”","“Put yer petticoats down, and stop being so foul-minded.”"
"“我不肮脏下流，”她反驳道，“腿是我自己的。为什么萨姆·亚当斯不能认为它们漂亮？”","“I’m not foul-minded,” she said.“My legs are my own.And why shouldn’t Sam Adams think they’re nice?”"
"谈话停了一会儿。他盯着她，眼神闪亮。","There was a pause.He watched her with eyes glittering to a point."
"“你曾经和他有什么瓜葛吗？”他问道。","“Have you been havin’ owt to do with him?” he asked."
"“我和他碰面时只是说说话而已，”她回答说，“他并不像你所想象中的那么坏。”","“I’ve just spoken to him when I’ve seen him,” she said.“He’s not as bad as you would make out.”"
"“不像吗？”他喊道，声音带有一种警觉， “那些与他有瓜葛的人对我来说都是坏人，我告诉你。”","“Isn’t he?” he cried, a certain wakefulness in his voice.“Them who has anything to do wi’ him is too bad for me, I tell you.”"
"“为什么，你怕他什么？”她嘲讽地问道。","“Why, what are you frightened of him for?” she mocked."
"她使他的愤怒到了不可控制的地步。他坐在那里，对她怒目而视。她说的每一个字都像烧红的烙铁一样刺激着他。再过不了多久，他将无法再忍受。她虽感到害怕，但是她既没有被征服，也没有被说服。","She was rousing all his uncontrollable anger.He sat glowering.Every one of her sentences stirred him up like a red-hot iron.Soon it would be too much.And she was afraid herself; but she was neither conquered nor convinced."
"他咧着嘴露出一种古怪的带着恨意的笑。他对她的怨恨由来已久。","A curious little grin of hate came on his face.He had a long score against her."
"“我怕他什么？”他下意识地重复着，“我怕他什么？为什么，为了你，你个拈花惹草的小荡妇。”","“What am I frightened of him for?” he repeated automatically.“What am I frightened of him for?Why, for you, you stray-running little bitch.”"
"她的脸通红。这侮辱一针见血，深深地刺痛了她。","She flushed.The insult went deep into her, right home."
"“好吧，要是你这么无聊的话——”她闭上眼睛，冷傲地说道。","“Well, if you’re so dull—” she said, lowering her eyelids, and speaking coldly, haughtily."
"“如果我那么无聊的话，我会在你和他说第一句话的时候就拧断你的脖子。”他激动地说道。","“If I’m so dull I’ll break your neck the first word you speak to him,” he said, tense."
"“嘁！”她冷笑道，","“Pf!” she sneered."
"“你认为我会怕你吗？”她无动于衷，冷漠地说道。","“Do you think I’m frightened of you?” she spoke coldly, detached."
"尽管如此，对于眼前发生的一切，她还是很害怕，嘴唇都发白了。","She was frightened, for all that, white round the mouth."
"他变得更加激动。","His heart was getting hotter."
"“下次你还敢和他有什么来往，我会让你怕我的。”他说道。","“You WILL be frightened of me, the next time you have anything to do with him,” he said."
"“你认为你会知道吗——哈！”","“Do you think YOU’D ever be told—ha!”"
"她嘲弄的语气令他炙热得发狂。他知道自己已经语无伦次了，无法对自己的行为负责。他感到窒息，便慢慢地站起身，迷迷糊糊地向门口走去，要去杀死她。","Her jeering scorn made him go white-hot, molten.He knew he was incoherent, scarcely responsible for what he might do.Slowly, unseeing, he rose and went out of doors, stifled, moved to kill her."
"他倚着花园的篱笆站着，什么也看不到，什么也听不见。在他脚下，远处闪耀着小镇的灯光。他静静地站着，面朝夜空，暴怒使他失去了知觉。","He stood leaning against the garden fence, unable either to see or hear.Below him, far off, fumed the lights of the town.He stood still, unconscious with a black storm of rage, his face lifted to the night."
"不久，他又走进了屋内，仍然没有意识到自己在干什么。瘦小的她倔强地站在那里，嘴紧闭着。她用那大大的、阴郁的、略显孩子气的眼睛盯着他，脸色害怕得发白。他拖着沉重的步伐穿过房间，一屁股坐到了椅子上。","Presently, still unconscious of what he was doing, he went indoors again.She stood, a small stubborn figure with tight-pressed lips and big, sullen, childish eyes, watching him, white with fear.He went heavily across the floor and dropped into his chair."
"一阵沉默。","There was a silence."
"“你不要跟我说什么应该做，什么不应该做。”最后，她打破了沉默。","“YOU’RE not going to tell me everything I shall do, and everything I shan’t,” she broke out at last."
"他抬起了头。","He lifted his head."
"“我告诉你，”他用低沉而严肃的声音说道，“如果你和萨姆·亚当斯有任何往来的话，我就会拧断你的脖子。”","“I tell you THIS,” he said, low and intense.  “Have anything to do with Sam Adams, and I'll break your neck.”"
"她大笑着，声音刺耳虚假。","She laughed, shrill and false."
"“我是多么恨你说的‘拧断你的脖子’，”她撇着嘴说道，“那听起来是那么粗鲁野蛮。你就不能说点别的——”","“How I hate your word ‘break your neck’,” she said, with a grimace of the mouth.“It sounds so common and beastly.Can’t you say something else—”"
"一阵死一般的沉默。","There was a dead silence."
"“除此之外，”她带着一种古怪的嘲弄的笑声，说道，“你还知道什么？他还送过我一个紫水晶胸针和一对珍珠耳环呢。”","“And besides,” she said, with a queer chirrup of mocking laughter, “what do you know about anything?He sent me an amethyst brooch and a pair of pearl ear-rings.”"
"“他什么？”惠斯顿突然用正常的语调问道。","“He what?” said Whiston, in a suddenly normal voice."
"眼睛一直盯着她。","His eyes were fixed on her."
"“送了我一对珍珠耳环和一个紫水晶胸针。”她机械地重复道，嘴唇显得十分苍白。","“Sent me a pair of pearl ear-rings, and an amethyst brooch,” she repeated, mechanically, pale to the lips."
"她那大大的，孩子气的黑眼睛注视着他，显得那么迷人，让人着魔。","And her big, black, childish eyes watched him, fascinated, held in her spell."
"他站起身来向她走去，猛地把脸和眼睛凑到她面前。她盯着他，害怕地呆在那里。她想要尖叫，却只从喉咙里发出细微的声音。","He seemed to thrust his face and his eyes forward at her, as he rose slowly and came to her.She watched transfixed in terror.Her throat made a small sound, as she tried to scream."
"然后，他反手扇了她一个耳光，快若闪电，把她摔到了墙上，让她眼睛昏花。她吓了一跳，痛苦地叫出了声。过了一会儿，她看到他还在向她靠近。他的眼睛注视着她，拳头放在后面，步步逼近。拳头随时都可能打到她身上。","Then, quick as lightning, the back of his hand struck her with a crash across the mouth, and she was flung back blinded against the wall.The shock shook a queer sound out of her.And then she saw him still coming on, his eyes holding her, his fist drawn back, advancing slowly.At any instant the blow might crash into her."
"她害怕极了，举起双手，用怪异的动作去遮住眼睛和太阳穴，张开嘴巴想要尖叫，却叫不出声音。房里没有一点声音。但是她这副摸样却逐渐阻止了他。他停在她面前，定神注视着她。她嘴角张开还在流血，眼睛睁得很大，双手护着太阳穴，蜷缩在墙根。他对她长久以来的怨恨产生了一种看她流血，撕裂她，毁灭她的欲望。这个欲望主宰着他。他想复仇。","Mad with terror, she raised her hands with a queer clawing movement to cover her eyes and her temples, opening her mouth in a dumb shriek.There was no sound.But the sight of her slowly arrested him.He hung before her, looking at her fixedly, as she stood crouched against the wall with open, bleeding mouth, and wide-staring eyes, and two hands clawing over her temples.And his lust to see her bleed, to break her and destroy her, rose from an old source against her.It carried him.He wanted satisfaction."
"但是他看到这个可怜兮兮的被吓坏了的女人站在那里，感到羞耻和恶心，他把脸撇到了一边。他重重地坐回到椅子上，大脑出奇地平静，像是睡着了似的。","But he had seen her standing there, a piteous, horrified thing, and he turned his face aside in shame and nausea.He went and sat heavily in his chair, and a curious ease, almost like sleep, came over his brain."
"她从墙边走向火炉，感到一阵眩晕，嘴唇苍白，下意识地擦拭着她那流血的小嘴。他坐在那里，没有动弹。渐渐地，她呼吸急促了起来，身体颤动着，开始默默地呜咽，为她自己而难过悲伤。尽管他没有抬头，也能想象到她的样子。这使他毁灭她的疯狂欲望又重新回来了。","She walked away from the wall towards the fire, dizzy, white to the lips, mechanically wiping her small, bleeding mouth.He sat motionless.Then, gradually, her breath began to hiss, she shook, and was sobbing silently, in grief for herself.Without looking, he saw.It made his mad desire to destroy her come back."
"终于，他抬起了头。他两眼放光，眼神定格在她的身上。","At length he lifted his head.His eyes were glowing again, fixed on her."
"“他给你那些东西是什么居心？”他问道，声音坚定而强硬。她立刻不再哭哭啼啼。她也十分紧张。","“And what did he give them you for?” he asked, in a steady, unyielding voice.Her crying dried up in a second.She also was tense."
"“情人节的礼物。”她回答道，即便被打也绝不屈服。","“They came as valentines,” she replied, still not subjugated, even if beaten."
"“什么时候的事情，今天吗？”","“When, today?”"
"“那对珍珠耳环是今天的事情——那枚紫水晶胸针是去年的事情。”","“The pearl ear-rings today—the amethyst brooch last year.”"
"“你已经收起来一年了？”","“You’ve had it a year?”"
"“是的。”","“Yes.”"
"她觉得如果他现在要站起来杀死她，什么也挡不住他。她再也阻止不了他了。她向他屈服了。他们都在危机状态下颤抖着，神志不清。","She felt that now nothing would prevent him if he rose to kill her.She could not prevent him any more.She was yielded up to him.They both trembled in the balance, unconscious."
"“你和他是什么关系？”他冷冰冰地问道。","“What have you had to do with him?” he asked, in a barren voice."
"“我和他什么关系都没有。”她颤抖地说。","“I’ve not had anything to do with him,” she quavered."
"“你留着它们仅仅因为他们是珠宝？”他问。一阵疲惫感向他袭来。再谈这些还有什么用呢？他不再在乎这些了。他觉得厌烦而疲倦。","“You just kept ’em because they were jewellery?” he said.A weariness came over him.What was the worth of speaking any more of it?He did not care any more.He was dreary and sick."
"她再一次哭了起来，但是他并没有注意。她不停地用手帕擦拭嘴角。他能够看到那块血迹。他无耻地动粗了，便要负责，这只会使他感到更加反感和疲惫。","She began to cry again, but he took no notice.She kept wiping her mouth on her handkerchief.He could see it, the blood-mark.It made him only more sick and tired of the responsibility of it, the violence, the shame."
"当她又开始到处走动时，死板地呆在原地的他再一次抬起头。","When she began to move about again, he raised his head once more from his dead, motionless position."
"“它们在楼上。”她颤抖着回答说。她知道他的火已经消了。","“They are upstairs,” she quavered.She knew the passion had gone down in him."
"“把它们拿下来。”他要求道。","“Bring them down,” he said."
"“我不，”她流着泪，愤怒地说，“你不要再欺辱我，也不要再扇我嘴巴了。”","“I won’t,” she wept, with rage.“You’re not going to bully me and hit me like that on the mouth.”"
"她又啜泣起来。他蔑视却又同情地看着她，怒火越积越多。","And she sobbed again.He looked at her in contempt and compassion and in rising anger."
"“东西在哪里？”他问道。“它们在镜子底下的小抽屉里。”她啜泣道。","“Where are they?” he said.“They’re in the little drawer under the looking-glass,” she sobbed."
"他缓缓地走上楼，划亮了一根火柴，找到了那些小饰品。他拿着那些东西下了楼。","He went slowly upstairs, struck a match, and found the trinkets.He brought them downstairs in his hand."
"“是这些吗？”他看着手里的东西，问道。她看着它们，没有回答。她对这些东西已经不再感兴趣了。","“These?” he said, looking at them as they lay in his palm.She looked at them without answering.She was not interested in them any more."
"他看着这些小珠宝。它们很漂亮。","He looked at the little jewels.They were pretty."
"“这并不是它们的错。”他自言自语道。","“It’s none of their fault,” he said to himself."
"他不紧不慢地执着地四处寻找，找一个盒子。他把这些东西收拾起来装好，写上萨姆·亚当斯的地址。然后，他穿着拖鞋去寄这个小包裹。","And he searched round slowly, persistently, for a box.He tied the things up and addressed them to Sam Adams.Then he went out in his slippers to post the little package."
"等他回来的时候，她仍然坐在那里哭。","When he came back she was still sitting crying."
"“你还是上床睡觉比较好。”他建议道。","“You’d better go to bed,” he said."
"她没有理会。他坐到了炉火旁边。她仍然在哭。","She paid no attention.He sat by the fire.She still cried."
"“我在这儿睡，”他说，“你上床去睡吧。”","“I’m sleeping down here,” he said.“Go you to bed.”"
"过了一会儿，她抬起被泪水沾湿了的浮肿的脸，无助而可怜地望着他。他全身闪过一阵剧烈的痛苦的感觉。他慢慢地走过去，把她轻轻地搂在怀里。她任由他抱着。她依偎在他肩膀上时，大声抽泣着说：","In a few moments she lifted her tear-stained, swollen face and looked at him with eyes all forlorn and pathetic.A great flash of anguish went over his body.He went over, slowly, and very gently took her in his hands.She let herself be taken.Then as she lay against his shoulder, she sobbed aloud:"
"“我从来没打算——”","“I never meant—”"
"“我的宝贝——我的小宝贝——”他痛苦地呼喊着，把她紧紧地抱在怀里。","“My love—my little love—” he cried, in anguish of spirit, holding her in his arms."
