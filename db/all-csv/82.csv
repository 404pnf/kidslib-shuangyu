"大城市里的神秘事件在如此短的时间里接踵而来，以至于约翰尼·贝尔钱伯斯的读者和朋友已不再为大约一年前他的突然离奇失踪而诧异。现在这个谜团已被解开，但是对一般人来说答案是如此离奇、令人难以置信，以至于只有少数与贝尔钱伯斯关系密切的人才完全相信它。","Mysteries follow one another so closely in a great city that the reading public and the friends of Johnny Bellchambers have ceased to marvel at his sudden and unexplained disappearance nearly a year ago.This particular mystery has now been cleared up, but the solution is so strange and incredible to the mind of the average man that only a select few who were in close touch with Bellchambers will give it full credence."
"众所周知，约翰尼·贝尔钱伯斯真正属于精英阶层之内。他虽不像那些时髦人物那样用各种千奇百怪的方法去炫耀他的财富，以吸引公众的注意，但是凡是能给他高高的社会地位增光的事情他都十分精通。","Johnny Bellchambers, as is well known, belonged to the intrinsically inner circle of the @élite@.Without any of the ostentation of the fashionable ones who endeavor to attract notice by eccentric display of wealth and show he still was @au fait@ in everything that gave deserved lustre to his high position in the ranks of society."
"在服饰方面，他尤其出众。模仿他的人可以说是望尘莫及。他的衣着总是大方得体、精雕细琢，而且他的衣服多得数都数不清，这使他成为全纽约也即全美国穿着最讲究的人。在纽约，没有一个裁缝不因能为贝尔钱伯斯做衣服而深感荣幸，即便是分文不取，他们也心甘情愿。他穿上他们的衣服，那衣服就成了无价的广告。他尤其喜爱裤子。他对裤子的要求也特别高。对他而言，穿起皱的裤子和穿打补丁的裤子没什么分别。他在公寓里雇了专人成天忙着为他熨他那数量繁多的衣服。他的朋友们说，三个小时不换衣服就是他的极限。","Especially did he shine in the matter of dress.In this he was the despair of imitators.Always correct, exquisitely groomed, and possessed of an unlimited wardrobe, he was conceded to be the best-dressed man in New York, and, therefore, in America.There was not a tailor in Gotham who would not have deemed it a precious boon to have been granted the privilege of making Bellchambers’ clothes without a cent of pay.As he wore them, they would have been a priceless advertisement.Trousers were his especial passion.Here nothing but perfection would he notice.He would have worn a patch as quickly as he would have overlooked a wrinkle.He kept a man in his apartments always busy pressing his ample supply.His friends said that three hours was the limit of time that he would wear these garments without exchanging."
"贝尔钱伯斯的失踪非常突然。起初，他的失踪并没有引起朋友们的警觉，直到三天后，他们才开始采取惯常的方法来调查这件事情。所有的方法都以失败告终。他根本没有留下任何线索。而后，他们试着搜寻他失踪的原因，但是一无所获。他没有仇敌，没欠债，也没有绯闻。他银行的账户里有几千美元。他从未表现出任何精神反常的倾向。事实上，他的性情非常冷静、平和。人们尝试了各种办法来寻找这个失踪的男人，但都是白费力气。最近几年，这样的案子增多了——人们消失得无影无踪，就像熄灭的蜡烛火焰，连一缕青烟也没留下。","Bellchambers disappeared very suddenly.For three days his absence brought no alarm to his friends, and then they began to operate the usual methods of inquiry.All of them failed.He had left absolutely no trace behind.Then the search for a motive was instituted, but none was found.He had no enemies, he had no debts, there was no woman.There were several thousand dollars in his bank to his credit.He had never showed any tendency toward mental eccentricity; in fact, he was of a particularly calm and well-balanced temperament.Every means of tracing the vanished man was made use of, but without avail.It was one of those cases—more numerous in late years—where men seem to have gone out like the flame of a candle, leaving not even a trail of smoke as a witness."
"五月，贝尔钱伯斯的两个老朋友汤姆·艾尔斯和兰斯洛特·吉列姆去了趟欧洲。一天，当他们在意大利和瑞士游山玩水时，碰巧听说瑞士的阿尔卑斯山上有座修道院——与一般的消遣型景点不同，它有其特殊的吸引力。这座修道院坐落在特别崎岖、险峻的尖坡上，普通游客很难登上那里。那里有三件鲜为人知但十分吸引人的事物。第一是修士们酿造的美妙绝伦的甜酒，据说远远超过本尼迪克特甜酒和察吐土酒。第二是一口用高超工艺浇铸的青铜大钟，自三百年前它第一次被敲响之后，其钟声便经久不息。最后，据称从未有英国人到过那里。艾尔斯和吉列姆决定去一探究竟。","In May, Tom Eyres and Lancelot Gilliam, two of Bellchambers’ old friends, went for a little run on the other side.While pottering around in Italy and Switzerland, they happened, one day, to hear of a monastery in the Swiss Alps that promised something outside of the ordinary tourist-beguiling attractions.The monastery was almost inaccessible to the average sightseer, being on an extremely rugged and precipitous spur of the mountains.The attractions it possessed but did not advertise were, first, an exclusive and divine cordial made by the monks that was said to far surpass benedictine and chartreuse.Next a huge brass bell so purely and accurately cast that it had not ceased sounding since it was first rung three hundred years ago.Finally, it was asserted that no Englishman had ever set foot within its walls.Eyres and Gilliam decided that these three reports called for investigation."
"他们在两名向导的帮助下用了两天时间到达了圣贡德劳修道院。修道院矗立于寒风凛冽的悬崖上，周围全是危如累卵的积雪。负责接待的修士们热情地招待了这些难得的游客。他们品尝到了珍贵的甜酒，发现它确实可以提神醒脑，令人回味无穷。他们听到了美妙的、经久不衰的钟声，了解到尽管英国人探索不止的足迹几乎遍布地球的每一个角落，但他俩却是踏进那灰石院墙的首批英国游客。","It took them two days with the aid of two guides to reach the monastery of St. Gondrau.It stood upon a frozen, wind-swept crag with the snow piled about it in treacherous, drifting masses.They were hospitably received by the brothers whose duty it was to entertain the infrequent guest.They drank of the precious cordial, finding it rarely potent and reviving.They listened to the great, ever-echoing bell, and learned that they were pioneer travelers, in those gray stone walls, over the Englishman whose restless feet have trodden nearly every corner of the earth."
"当天下午三点钟，两个年轻的纽约人和友善的克里斯托弗修士一起站在修道院宽敞、寒冷的门厅里，看修士们排队穿过门厅，向饭厅走去。他们两人一排，低着头缓慢行进，穿着草鞋的脚毫无声息地踩在高低不平的石板上。队伍缓慢经过时，艾尔斯突然抓住吉列姆的胳膊。“看，”他急切地低语道，“现在在你对面的那个人——在我们这一侧的那个把手放在腰间的人——那不是约翰尼·贝尔钱伯斯才怪呢！”","At three o’clock on the afternoon they arrived, the two young Gothamites stood with good Brother Cristofer in the great, cold hallway of the monastery to watch the monks march past on their way to the refectory.They came slowly, pacing by twos, with their heads bowed, treading noiselessly with sandaled feet upon the rough stone flags.As the procession slowly filed past, Eyres suddenly gripped Gilliam by the arm.“Look,” he whispered, eagerly, “at the one just opposite you now—the one on this side, with his hand at his waist—if that isn’t Johnny Bellchambers then I never saw him!”"
"吉列姆看到并且认出了那个失踪的时尚引领者。","Gilliam saw and recognized the lost glass of fashion."
"“见鬼了，”他惊奇地说，“老贝尔在这儿搞什么名堂？汤米，绝不可能是他！从没听说过贝尔信宗教。事实上，当他的领结打得不合适时，我只听过他骂娘，没有听他诅咒过神灵。”","“What the deuce,” said he, wonderingly, “is old Bell doing here?Tommy, it surely can’t be he!Never heard of Bell having a turn for the religious.Fact is, I’ve heard him say things when a four-in-hand didn’t seem to tie up just right that would bring him up for court-martial before any church.”"
"“是贝尔，毫无疑问，”艾尔斯十分肯定地说，“否则我很需要看看眼科大夫了。但是想想看，约翰尼·贝尔钱伯斯——时尚界的泰斗和社交界的才子，怎么会穿着黄褐色的僧衣在这冰天雪地里苦修呢！我想不通。我们去问问接待我们的老好人吧。”","“It’s Bell, without a doubt,” said Eyres, firmly, “or I’m pretty badly in need of an oculist.But think of Johnny Bellchambers, the Royal High Chancellor of swell togs and the Mahatma of pink teas, up here in cold storage doing penance in a snuff-colored bathrobe!I can’t get it straight in my mind.Let’s ask the jolly old boy that’s doing the honors.”"
"他们去问克里斯托弗修士。这时，修士们已进入饭厅。他不清楚他们说的是谁。贝尔钱伯斯？啊，圣贡德劳的修士们出家立誓时舍弃了他们的世俗名字。两位先生想要和那位修士谈话吗？如果他们去饭厅指出他们想见的人，尊敬的院长一定会答应的。","Brother Cristofer was appealed to for information.By that time the monks had passed into the refectory.He could not tell to which one they referred.Bellchambers?Ah, the brothers of St. Gondrau abandoned their worldly names when they took the vows.Did the gentlemen wish to speak with one of the brothers?If they would come to the refectory and indicate the one they wished to see, the reverend abbot in authority would, doubtless, permit it."
"艾尔斯和吉列姆进入饭厅向克里斯托弗修士指出他们看到的人。是的，正是约翰尼·贝尔钱伯斯。现在，他们看清了他的脸，他正坐在那些灰不溜秋的修士中间，一直低着头，用一个褐色、粗糙的碗喝清汤。","Eyres and Gilliam went into the dining hall and pointed out to Brother Cristofer the man they had seen.Yes, it was Johnny Bellchambers.They saw his face plainly now, as he sat among the dingy brothers, never looking up, eating broth from a coarse, brown bowl."
"修道院院长答应了两位游客想同一位修士交谈的请求，他们两人在会客室里等他过来。穿草鞋的修士悄无声息地进来时，艾尔斯和吉列姆都困惑而吃惊地看着他。他是约翰尼·贝尔钱伯斯，但看起来却又不像是他。他刮得光洁的脸上有一种无法形容的祥和表情，一种达到超脱境界的喜悦表情，一种圆满、纯粹的幸福表情。他气度非凡，眼睛里闪着祥和脱俗的光芒。他的衣着同以前在纽约时一样整洁，但是又有很大的不同！现在他似乎只穿了一件衣服——一件褐色粗布长袍，腰间系着一根绳子，直直地垂下来，宽松的褶皱几乎直到脚背。他还像以前那样自然优雅地同拜访者握手。如果这次见面有任何尴尬，表现出窘迫的绝不会是约翰尼·贝尔钱伯斯。屋子里没有椅子，他们站着交谈。","Permission to speak to one of the brothers was granted to the two travelers by the abbot, and they waited in a reception room for him to come.When he did come, treading softly in his sandals, both Eyres and Gilliam looked at him in perplexity and astonishment.It was Johnny Bellchambers, but he had a different look.Upon his smooth-shaven face was an expression of ineffable peace, of rapturous attainment, of perfect and complete happiness.His form was proudly erect, his eyes shone with a serene and gracious light.He was as neat and well-groomed as in the old New York days, but how differently was he clad!Now he seemed clothed in but a single garment—a long robe of rough brown cloth, gathered by a cord at the waist, and falling in straight, loose folds nearly to his feet.He shook hands with his visitors with his old ease and grace of manner.If there was any embarrassment in that meeting it was not manifested by Johnny Bellchambers.The room had no seats; they stood to converse."
"“老兄，很高兴见到你，”艾尔斯有些笨拙地说，“没想到会在这儿找着你。不管怎么说，这主意还不赖。人生本来就是一场空。抛开世俗，退隐到——呃——冥想——呃——祷告和颂唱诸如此类的事情中，一定是一种解脱。”","“Glad to see you, old man,” said Eyres, somewhat awkwardly.“Wasn’t expecting to find you up here.Not a bad idea though, after all.Society’s an awful sham.Must be a relief to shake the giddy whirl and retire to—er—contemplation and—er—prayer and hymns, and those things."
"“得了，少来这套，汤米，”贝尔钱伯斯愉快地说道，“别担心，我不会叫你们捐钱的。我和那些老修士们做这些只是因为这是戒律。你们知道，在这儿我是安布罗斯修士。我只能同你们谈十分钟。吉列姆，你穿的坎肩是新款，是吗？现在百老汇大街上的人都这样穿吗？”","“Oh, cut that, Tommy,” said Bellchambers, cheerfully.“Don’t be afraid that I’ll pass around the plate.I go through these thing-um-bobs with the rest of these old boys because they are the rules.I’m Brother Ambrose here, you know.I’m given just ten minutes to talk to you fellows.That’s rather a new design in waistcoats you have on, isn’t it, Gilliam?Are they wearing those things on Broadway now?”"
"“还是那个老约翰尼，”吉列姆高兴地说，“你究竟——我的意思是为什么——噢，真该死！老兄，你为什么要这样做？”","“It’s the same old Johnny,” said Gilliam, joyfully.“What the devil—I mean why—Oh, confound it! What did you do it for, old man?”"
"“脱掉僧衣，”艾尔斯几乎眼含泪水地恳求道，“和我们回去吧。那些老朋友们见到你一定会欣喜若狂的。你不属于这里，贝尔。你莫名其妙地甩掉我们后，据我所知有五六个姑娘默默为你憔悴。递上辞呈，申请豁免或用其他任何方法，离开这个冰雪覆盖的地方吧。在这儿你会生病的，约翰尼——而且——我的天哪！你都没穿袜子！”","“Peel the bathrobe,” pleaded Eyres, almost tearfully, “and go back with us.The old crowd’ll go wild to see you.This isn’t in your line, Bell.I know half a dozen girls that wore the willow on the quiet when you shook us in that unaccountable way.Hand in your resignation, or get a dispensation, or whatever you have to do to get a release from this ice factory.You’ll get catarrh here, Johnny—and—My God! You haven’t any socks on!”"
"贝尔钱伯斯低头看看他穿草鞋的脚，微微一笑。","Bellchambers looked down at his sandaled feet and smiled."
"“你们不会理解的，”他安慰他们说，“你们要我回去是一片好心，但我回不到过去了。在这儿，我所有的目标都实现了。我觉得很心满意足。我会在这里终老。你们看到我穿的僧袍了吗？”贝尔钱伯斯深情地抚摸着他直笼统的袍子说道，“我终于找到膝盖部分不会鼓起来的衣服了。我成功了——”","“You fellows don’t understand,” he said, soothingly.“It’s nice of you to want me to go back, but the old life will never know me again.I have reached here the goal of all my ambitions.I am entirely happy and contented.Here I shall remain for the remainder of my days.You see this robe that I wear?”Bellchambers caressingly touched the straight-hanging garment: “At last I have found something that will not bag at the knees.I have attained—” "
"这时，那口青铜大钟低沉的隆隆声在修道院里回荡。一定是召唤大家马上去祈祷，因为安布罗斯修士低下头，转过身，一言不发地离开了会客厅。他经过门廊的石板地时轻轻地挥了挥手，好像在同老朋友们告别。他们离开了修道院，之后再也没有见过他。","At that moment the deep boom of the great brass bell reverberated through the monastery.It must have been a summons to immediate devotions, for Brother Ambrose bowed his head, turned and left the chamber without another word.A slight wave of his hand as he passed through the stone doorway seemed to say a farewell to his old friends.They left the monastery without seeing him again."
"这就是汤姆·艾尔斯和兰斯洛特·吉列姆从他们最近的欧洲之旅中带回的故事。","And this is the story that Tommy Eyres and Lancelot Gilliam brought back with them from their latest European tour."
