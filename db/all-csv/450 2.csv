"The Champion of the Weather","天气寒暄冠军"
"by O. Henry","作者：欧·亨利"
"If you should speak of the Kiowa Reservation to the average New Yorker he probably wouldn’t know whether you were referring to a new political dodge at Albany or a leitmotif from “Parsifal.”","要是你跟普通的纽约人说起基奥瓦保留地，他或许不知道你指的是奥尔巴尼的一个新的政治诡计呢，还是《帕西法尔》里的一个主题。","译者注：Parsifal（帕西法尔），中世纪传奇中的人物，圆桌骑士之一，德国作曲家瓦格纳根据他的故事编写了歌剧《帕西法尔》。"
"But out in the Kiowa Reservation advices have been received concerning the existence of New York.","但是，基奥瓦保留地那里的人却得到了与纽约人相处的忠告。"
"A party of us were on a hunting trip in the Reservation.","我们一行人在保留地打猎旅行。"
"Bud Kingsbury, our guide, philosopher, and friend, was broiling antelope steaks in camp one night.","一天晚上，我们的向导、哲学家和朋友巴德·金斯伯里在营地里烤羚羊肉排。"
"One of the party, a pinkish-haired young man in a correct hunting costume, sauntered over to the fire to light a cigarette, and remarked carelessly to Bud:","同行的人中一个穿着正规猎装，长着淡红色头发的小伙子漫步到篝火旁，点了一支烟，漫不经心地对巴德说："
"“Nice night!”","“今晚天气不错！”"
"“Why, yes,” said Bud, “as nice as any night could be that ain’t received the Broadway stamp of approval.”","“啊，是啊，”巴德回应道，“像纽约不需要百老汇批准的任何一晚一样美好。”"
"Now, the young man was from New York, but the rest of us wondered how Bud guessed it.","这小伙子的确是纽约人，只是我们纳闷巴德怎么会猜到的。"
"So, when the steaks were done, we besought him to lay bare his system of ratiocination.","羚羊肉排烤好后，我们就恳求他说说他的推理方法。"
"And as Bud was something of a Territorial talking machine he made oration as follows:","巴德算得上是准州地区的话匣子，他讲了如下一番话："
"“How did I know he was from New York?","“我怎么知道他是纽约人？"
"Well, I figured it out as soon as he sprung them two words on me.","其实，他一开口跟我搭讪，我就知道了。"
"I was in New York myself a couple of years ago, and I noticed some of the earmarks and hoof tracks of the Rancho Manhattan.”","几年前我在纽约呆过，我能辨认出曼哈顿牧场出来牲畜的耳记和蹄印。”"
"“Found New York rather different from the Panhandle, didn’t you, Bud?” asked one of the hunters.","一个猎人问道：“巴德，你是不是发现纽约和锅柄地带大不一样？”"
"“Can’t say that I did,” answered Bud; “anyways, not more than some.","“不能说完全了解，”巴德回答说，“多少有些了解。"
"The main trail in that town which they call Broadway is plenty travelled, but they’re about the same brand of bipeds that tramp around in Cheyenne and Amarillo, At first I was sort of rattled by the crowds, but I soon says to myself, ‘Here, now, Bud; they’re just plain folks like you and Geronimo and Grover Cleveland and the Watson boys, so don’t get all flustered up with consternation under your saddle blanket,’ and then I feels calm and peaceful, like I was back in the Nation again at a ghost dance or a green corn pow-wow.","那条他们称为百老汇的大街上，来往行人很多，不过和夏延和阿马里洛的两足动物的种类相差无几。一开始，熙熙攘攘的人头攒动使我有些慌张，但是后来我对自己说：‘嘿，巴德，他们无非是些普通人，跟你自己、杰罗尼莫、格罗弗·克利夫兰和沃森兄弟一样，没必要惊慌失措。’这样一来，我踏实多了，仿佛又回到了保留地，正在参加印第安人的鬼神舞和庆祝玉米丰收的狂欢活动。”"
"“I’d been saving up for a year to give this New York a whirl.","“那时，我攒了一年钱，准备到纽约来一个短暂旅行。"
"I knew a man named Summers that lived there, but I couldn’t find him; so I played a lone hand at enjoying the intoxicating pleasures of the corn-fed metropolis.","我有一个叫萨默斯的朋友住在那里，可是我没能找到他，所以我只好独自享受那个喧嚣大都会的醉人的快乐。"
"“For a while I was so frivolous and locoed by the electric lights and the noises of the phonographs and the second-story railroads that I forgot one of the crying needs of my Western system of natural requirements.","“五光十色的电灯、留声机里传出的音乐和高架铁路的轰响一度让我烦躁到发疯，都忘了作为西部人本性中的一个迫切需要。"
"I never was no hand to deny myself the pleasures of sociable vocal intercourse with friends and strangers.","我一向喜欢和朋友和陌生人进行语言交流。"
"Out in the Territories when I meet a man I never saw before, inside of nine minutes I know his income, religion, size of collar, and his wife’s temper, and how much he pays for clothes, alimony, and chewing tobacco.","如果我在准州地区遇上一个从未见过面的人，九分钟之内，我就可以知道他的收入、宗教信仰、衣领尺寸、他妻子的脾气，和他在添置衣服、维持生计跟买嚼烟方面的花费有多少。"
"It’s a gift with me not to be penurious with my conversation.","不吝啬与对方的谈话是我的一个天赋。"
"“But this here New York was inaugurated on the idea of abstemiousness in regard to the parts of speech.","“但是纽约这里似乎崇尚言简意赅的原则。"
"At the end of three weeks nobody in the city had fired even a blank syllable in my direction except the waiter in the grub emporium where I fed.","我呆了将近三个星期，除了我就餐的那家饭馆的侍者之外，没有其他人跟我说过话。"
"And as his outpourings of syntax wasn’t nothing but plagiarisms from the bill of fare, he never satisfied my yearnings, which was to have somebody hit.","那侍者说的话也都是照搬菜单，根本无法满足我想要找人一吐为快的欲望。"
"If I stood next to a man at a bar he’d edge off and give a Baldwin-Ziegler look as if he suspected me of having the North Pole concealed on my person.","假使我在酒吧前一站，旁边的人就会挪开一点儿，一副避之不及的样子，好像我身上藏着整个北极似的。"
"I began to wish that I’d gone to Abilene or Waco for my paseado; for the mayor of them places will drink with you, and the first citizen you meet will tell you his middle name and ask you to take a chance in a raffle for a music box.","我倒希望当初是去阿比林或者韦科玩，因为那些地方的市长都会陪你喝酒，你遇到的第一个居民会把他的中间的名字告诉你，还会让你抽奖碰碰运气，没准能得到一个音乐盒。"
"“Well, one day when I was particular hankering for to be gregarious with something more loquacious than a lamp post, a fellow in a caffy says to me, says he:","“有一天，我特别想找一个比电线杆健谈的对象说说话。酒馆里一个伙计招呼我说："
"“‘Nice day!’","“‘天气不错！’"
"“He was a kind of a manager of the place, and I reckon he’d seen me in there a good many times.","“那人应该是酒馆的经理，我估计他见过我这个熟客多次。"
"He had a face like a fish and an eye like Judas, but I got up and put one arm around his neck.","他长了一张鱼脸和一双犹大的眼睛，但我马上起身，搂住他的脖子。"
"“‘Pardner,’ I says, ‘sure it’s a nice day.","“‘嘿，伙计，’我说，‘天气确实不赖。"
"You’re the first gentleman in all New York to observe that the intricacies of human speech might not be altogether wasted on William Kingsbury.","你是全纽约第一个注意到人类错综复杂的语言在威廉·金斯伯里身上不会白白浪费的人。"
"But don’t you think,’ says I, ‘that ’twas a little cool early in the morning; and ain’t there a feeling of rain in the air to-night?","但是，你觉不觉得，’我继续说道，‘清晨稍微有些凉，今晚的空气里有点儿要下雨的意思？"
"But along about noon it sure was gallupsious weather.","不过中午时候的天气确实好极了。"
"How’s all up to the house?","你家里一切平安吗？"
"You doing right well with the caffy, now?’","酒馆这阵子买卖如何？’"
"“Well, sir, that galoot just turns his back and walks off stiff, without a word, after all my trying to be agreeable!","“可是，你们看，尽管我使出浑身解数想迎合那傻瓜，他却一句话也没说，转身讪讪地走开了！"
"I didn’t know what to make of it.","我真搞不懂该怎么办才好。"
"That night I finds a note from Summers, who’d been away from town, giving the address of his camp.","那天晚上，我收到萨默斯的来信，说是之前到城外野营去了。"
"I goes up to his house and has a good, old-time talk with his folks.","我便到他家里，同他一家痛快地聊了起来。"
"And I tells Summers about the actions of this coyote in the caffy, and desires interpretation.","我把酒馆里那个野蛮人的事告诉萨默斯，希望他给我解释一下。"
"“‘Oh,’ says Summers, ‘he wasn’t intending to strike up a conversation with you.","“‘哦，’萨默斯说，‘他并不想跟你攀谈。"
"That’s just the New York style.","那只是纽约式的寒暄。"
"He’d seen you was a regular customer and he spoke a word or two just to show you he appreciated your custom.","他知道你是常客，说一两句话对你光顾他的生意表示感谢。"
"You oughtn’t to have followed it up.","你当时不必接他的话。"
"That’s about as far as we care to go with a stranger.","就当是对待陌生人一样。"
"A word or so about the weather may be ventured, but we don’t generally make it the basis of an acquaintance.’","可以说一两句关于天气的话，但我们不把那当作交朋友的基础。’"

"Meteorology is one of my sore points.","气象学是我的痛处之一。"
"No man can open up the question of temperature or humidity or the glad sunshine with me, and then turn tail on it without its leading to a falling barometer.","无论谁跟我提起温度、湿度或者灿烂的阳光，不继续说气压下降，扭头就走，那可不行。"
"I’m going down to see that man again and give him a lesson in the art of continuous conversation.","我会再去找那个人，给他上一课，讲讲使谈话继续下去的艺术。"
"You say New York etiquette allows him two words and no answer.","你说纽约规矩允许他甩出一两句话不必等回应。"
"Well, he’s going to turn himself into a weather bureau and finish what he begun with me, besides indulging in neighbourly remarks on other subjects.’","哼，对我可不行。我要把他变成气象局，非让他把先挑起的话题说完不可，并且要接着尽情聊聊其他有关的话题。’"
"“Summers talked agin it, but I was irritated some and I went on the street car back to that caffy.","“萨默斯不赞同我的做法，但我心里头有气，就乘上电车回到了那家酒馆。"
"“The same fellow was there yet, walking round in a sort of back corral where there was tables and chairs.","“那个人还在那个有桌椅的畜栏似的地方走来走去。"
"A few people was sitting around having drinks and sneering at one another.","房间里散坐着一些喝酒的顾客，他们正在互相抬杠。"

"Now,’ says I, ‘you frog-hearted, language-shy, stiff-necked cross between a Spitzbergen sea cook and a muzzled oyster, you resume where you left off in your discourse on the weather.’","你听好，’我接着说，‘你这个长着青蛙心、寡言少语、倔头倔脑的新水手和闭嘴牡蛎的杂交品种，现在把你没说完的天气话题接着说完。’"
"“The fellow looks at me and tries to grin, but he sees I don’t and he comes around serious.","“那家伙瞅着我，咧嘴想笑，但看到我并没有笑意，便也收起笑容，严肃起来。"
"“‘Well,’ says he, eyeing the handle of my gun, ‘it was rather a nice day; some warmish, though.’","“‘嗯，’他瞥着我的枪把说，‘天气相当好，就是有些热。’"
