"初恋","First Love"
"第一章","CHAPTER I"
"当时我十六岁。事情发生在一八八三年的夏天。","I was sixteen then.It happened in the summer of 1833."
"我与父母一同住在莫斯科。他们在卡鲁加门附近的涅斯库奇内公园对面租了一座乡间别墅避暑。那时，我准备考大学，可我却不怎么用功，也不着急。","I lived in Moscow with my parents.They had taken a country house for the summer near the Kalouga gate, facing the Neskutchny gardens.I was preparing for the university, but did not work much and was in no hurry."
"没有人管束我。我想做什么就做什么，尤其是我的最后一位家庭教师离开之后。他是个法国人，一想到自己“像颗炸弹一样”被丢到俄国，他就很不甘心，常常接连几天无精打采地躺在床上，一脸恼怒的神色。父亲待我虽亲切，却并不关心我。母亲几乎很少注意到我，尽管她只有我这么一个孩子，因为其他事情完全占据了她的精力。我父亲还很年轻，而且十分英俊，他是出于经济利益的考虑才娶了母亲，母亲比他大十岁。我母亲生活并不快乐：她总是焦虑不安、嫉妒、爱发脾气——不过都是父亲不在场的时候。母亲非常怕父亲，他严厉、冷漠、令人难以亲近。我从没见过比父亲更镇定自若、更自信和威风凛凛的人。","No one interfered with my freedom.I did what I liked, especially after parting with my last tutor, a Frenchman who had never been able to get used to the idea that he had fallen ‘like a bomb’ (comme une bombe) into Russia, and would lie sluggishly in bed with an expression of exasperation on his face for days together.My father treated me with careless kindness; my mother scarcely noticed me, though she had no children except me; other cares completely absorbed her.My father, a man still young and very handsome, had married her from mercenary considerations; she was ten years older than he.My mother led a melancholy life; she was for ever agitated, jealous and angry, but not in my father’s presence; she was very much afraid of him, and he was severe, cold, and distant in his behaviour....I have never seen a man more elaborately serene, self-confident, and commanding."
"我永远也不会忘记我在乡间别墅里度过的头几个星期。五月九日圣尼古拉斯节这天，天气很好，我们出了城。我经常散步——有时在自家花园，有时在涅斯库奇内公园，有时在郊外。我总随身携带一本书，比如说，卡依达诺夫的历史教科书，不过几乎不看；更多时候我大声朗诵诗歌，并熟记大量诗句；血液在我体内翻腾，我内心隐隐作痛，既觉得甜蜜，又觉得有点荒唐；我内心充满希望与期待，又有所畏惧，我对一切都感到惊奇不已，殷切期盼着什么；我的想象力总是围绕着一些相同的景象驰骋着，就像黎明时燕子绕着钟楼盘旋一样；我梦想着，内心充满忧伤，甚至落泪；尽管悦耳的诗句和黄昏的美景常激起我的忧伤和泪水，然而甜美的青春气息和欢快的生命，穿越了忧伤和泪水，像春日的小草一样蓬勃而出。","I shall never forget the first weeks I spent at the country house.The weather was magnificent; we left town on the 9th of May, on St. Nicholas’s day.I used to walk about in our garden, in the Neskutchny gardens, and beyond the town gates; I would take some book with me—Keidanov’s Course, for instance—but I rarely looked into it, and more often than anything declaimed verses aloud; I knew a great deal of poetry by heart; my blood was in a ferment and my heart ached—so sweetly and absurdly; I was all hope and anticipation, was a little frightened of something, and full of wonder at everything, and was on the tiptoe of expectation; my imagination played continually, fluttering rapidly about the same fancies, like martins about a bell-tower at dawn; I dreamed, was sad, even wept; but through the tears and through the sadness, inspired by a musical verse, or the beauty of evening, shot up like grass in spring the delicious sense of youth and effervescent life."
"我有一匹马。我常常亲自给它套上马鞍，独自一人骑着它去远处，纵横驰骋，幻想着自己是个比武的骑士。风在我耳边欢快地呼啸而过！或者我抬头仰望着天空，把明媚的阳光和湛蓝的天空摄入我热情敞开的心灵。","I had a horse to ride; I used to saddle it myself and set off alone for long rides, break into a rapid gallop and fancy myself a knight at a tournament.How gaily the wind whistled in my ears!or turning my face towards the sky, I would absorb its shining radiance and blue into my soul, that opened wide to welcome it."
"我记得，那个时候，女人的形象，爱情的幻想，几乎没有以明确的轮廓在我脑海里出现过。但是一种新奇的、无比甜蜜的女性特征……这种懵懵懂懂的、羞涩的潜意识却潜藏在我所想到的和所感触到的一切事物中了。","I remember that at that time the image of woman, the vision of love, scarcely ever arose in definite shape in my brain; but in all I thought, in all I felt, lay hidden a half-conscious, shamefaced presentiment of something new, unutterably sweet, feminine...."
"这种预感、这种期待渗透了我的整个身心；我呼吸着它，它在我血管的每滴血液中奔腾着……它注定就会很快实现。","This presentiment, this expectation, permeated my whole being; I breathed in it, it coursed through my veins with every drop of blood ... it was destined to be soon fulfilled."
"那个夏天我们住的避暑别墅是座带圆柱的木质宅第，两侧有两间小厢房。左侧的厢房是一个生产廉价墙纸的小工厂……我不止一次去那儿闲逛。总是看到十来个男孩——体态瘦弱、头发蓬乱、面容枯黄，穿着油迹斑斑的长褂——不时地跳到木杠杆上去压印刷机的矩形板，就这样他们用自己瘦小身体的重量压印出墙纸上各种各样的图案。右侧的厢房空着，有待出租。有一天——也就是五月九日那天之后又过了三周——这侧厢房的百叶窗全打开了，窗口出现了女人们的面孔——有户人家搬进来了。我记得当天吃晚饭时，母亲问管家我们的新邻居是何许人，听到是位姓扎谢金的公爵夫人时，母亲先显出一些敬意说：“啊！公爵夫人……”接着补充了一句：“大概是个穷夫人吧。”","The place, where we settled for the summer, consisted of a wooden manor-house with columns and two small lodges; in the lodge on the left there was a tiny factory for the manufacture of cheap wall-papers....I had more than once strolled that way to look at about a dozen thin and dishevelled boys with greasy smocks and worn faces, who were perpetually jumping on to wooden levers, that pressed down the square blocks of the press, and so by the weight of their feeble bodies struck off the variegated patterns of the wall-papers.The lodge on the right stood empty, and was to let.One day—three weeks after the 9th of May—the blinds in the windows of this lodge were drawn up, women’s faces appeared at them—some family had installed themselves in it. I remember the same day at dinner, my mother inquired of the butler who were our new neighbours, and hearing the name of the Princess Zasyekin, first observed with some respect, ‘Ah! a princess!’ ... and then added, ‘A poor one, I suppose?’"
"“她们是租三辆马车来的，”管家上菜时恭敬地说，“她们没有自己的马车，家具也极其简单。”","‘They arrived in three hired flies,’ the butler remarked deferentially, as he handed a dish: ‘they don’t keep their own carriage, and the furniture’s of the poorest.’"
"“哦，”母亲答道，“那样更好。”","‘Ah,’ replied my mother, ‘so much the better.’"
"父亲冷冷地扫了她一眼，她便不作声了。","My father gave her a chilly glance; she was silent."
"的确，扎谢金公爵夫人不可能是个有钱人。她租的厢房是如此破旧，又小又矮，即便是稍微富裕点的人都不愿意住这样的房子。然而，那时这些话左耳进右耳出，我并不在意。公爵头衔对我没有什么影响，因为我刚刚读过席勒的《强盗》。","Certainly the Princess Zasyekin could not be a rich woman; the lodge she had taken was so dilapidated and small and low-pitched that people, even moderately well-off in the world, would hardly have consented to occupy it.At the time, however, all this went in at one ear and out at the other.The princely title had very little effect on me; I had just been reading Schiller’s ＠Robbers@."
"第二章","CHAPTER II"
"我习惯在每个傍晚时分到花园里闲逛，等着乌鸦出现。我对这种胆小、狡猾、贪婪的鸟痛恨已久。就在我前面所讲的那一天，我像往常一样去了花园，走遍了所有的小径，无一无所获（乌鸦认出了我，老远就断断续续地呱呱叫起来），我偶然走近了把我家花园与右侧厢房的狭长花园隔开的低矮栅栏。我沿着栅栏，埋头走着。突然间我听到一个声音；隔着栅栏望过去，我不禁愣住了……一片令人纳闷的景象呈现在我的面前。","I was in the habit of wandering about our garden every evening on the look-out for rooks.I had long cherished a hatred for those wary, sly, and rapacious birds.On the day of which I have been speaking, I went as usual into the garden, and after patrolling all the walks without success (the rooks knew me, and merely cawed spasmodically at a distance), I chanced to go close to the low fence which separated our domain from the narrow strip of garden stretching beyond the lodge to the right, and belonging to it.I was walking along, my eyes on the ground.Suddenly I heard a voice; I looked across the fence, and was thunder-struck....I was confronted with a curious spectacle."
"离我几步远的草地上，就在翠绿的木莓丛中站着一个身材高挑、窈窕的少女，她身穿一条粉色条纹的连衣裙，头上戴着一块白色方巾；四个年轻人紧紧地围在她身旁，她拿了一些灰色的小花朵轮流敲打他们的前额；我不知道这些花的名称，但孩子们都非常熟悉它们；这些花的形状就像一个个小袋子，每当敲到硬物上面时就啪的一声裂开。那几个年轻人都热切地把额头迎上去，这个少女的动作（我只看到她的侧面）如此让人着迷，略带点专横,又有几分爱抚、嘲弄，十分迷人；我又惊又喜，差点叫出声来；我想我愿意立刻放弃这世间的一切，只为了她那纤细的手指也能敲敲我的额头。我的枪滑落到草地上。我忘却了一切，目不转睛地望着她那苗条优美的身材，白皙的脖子，美丽的手臂，还有那白色头巾下微微蓬松的浅色头发，那半睁半闭的聪慧的眼睛，睫毛以及睫毛下那柔软的脸颊……","A few paces from me on the grass between the green raspberry bushes stood a tall slender girl in a striped pink dress, with a white kerchief on her head; four young men were close round her, and she was slapping them by turns on the forehead with those small grey flowers, the name of which I don’t know, though they are well known to children; the flowers form little bags, and burst open with a pop when you strike them against anything hard.The young men presented their foreheads so eagerly, and in the gestures of the girl (I saw her in profile), there was something so fascinating, imperious, caressing, mocking, and charming, that I almost cried out with admiration and delight, and would, I thought, have given everything in the world on the spot only to have had those exquisite fingers strike me on the forehead.My gun slipped on to the grass, I forgot everything, I devoured with my eyes the graceful shape and neck and lovely arms and the slightly disordered fair hair under the white kerchief, and the half-closed clever eye, and the eyelashes and the soft cheek beneath them...."
"“年轻人，嘿，年轻人，”突然我身边冒出一个声音，“可以盯着陌生小姐看吗？”","‘Young man, hey, young man,’ said a voice suddenly near me: ‘is it quite permissible to stare so at unknown young ladies?’"
"我不禁惊愕，呆住了……在栅栏那边，离我很近的地方站了一个男人，黑头发剪得短短的，正在用嘲弄的目光看着我。同一时刻，那位少女也转身面向了我……我在一张生动活泼的脸上看到了一双灰色的大眼睛。她的整个面孔突然颤动了一下，笑了起来，洁白的牙齿闪闪发亮，眉毛有趣地向上一挑……我满脸通红，从地上捡起猎枪，在一阵响亮的、但并无恶意的笑声中逃回自己的房间，扑到床上，用双手捂住了脸。我的心怦怦跳得厉害；我既害羞又高兴；我从来没这么激动过。","I started, I was struck dumb....Near me, the other side of the fence, stood a man with close-cropped black hair, looking ironically at me.At the same instant the girl too turned towards me....I caught sight of big grey eyes in a bright mobile face, and the whole face suddenly quivered and laughed, there was a flash of white teeth, a droll lifting of the eyebrows....I crimsoned, picked up my gun from the ground, and pursued by a musical but not ill-natured laugh, fled to my own room, flung myself on the bed, and hid my face in my hands.My heart was fairly leaping; I was greatly ashamed and overjoyed; I felt an excitement I had never known before."
"休息了一会儿后，我梳了梳头发，洗漱了一番，下楼喝茶去了。那位年轻少女的形象在我眼前浮现，我的心跳得不那么厉害了，但充满着一种甜蜜的压抑感。","After a rest, I brushed my hair, washed, and went downstairs to tea.The image of the young girl floated before me, my heart was no longer leaping, but was full of a sort of sweet oppression."
"“怎么了？”父亲突然问我。“打着乌鸦了吗？”","‘What’s the matter?’ my father asked me all at once: ‘have you killed a rook?’"
"我本想把一切都告诉他，但我克制住了自己，只是暗自笑了笑。上床睡觉时，我也不知道为什么用一只脚支撑着转了三圈，然后涂上发油，就躺下睡了，一整夜都睡得酣甜。黎明前我醒了一会儿，抬头兴高采烈地望了望四周，又睡着了。","I was on the point of telling him all about it, but I checked myself, and merely smiled to myself.As I was going to bed, I rotated—I don’t know why—three times on one leg, pomaded my hair, got into bed, and slept like a top all night.Before morning I woke up for an instant, raised my head, looked round me in ecstasy, and fell asleep again."
"第三章","CHAPTER III"
"“我该怎样结识他们呢？”这是我早晨醒后的第一个念头。喝早茶前，我又去了花园，但并没有太靠近那道栅栏，也没有看见任何人。喝过茶后，我几次走过别墅前面的那条街道，远远地望着窗子……我觉得她的脸就躲在窗帘后面，于是惊慌地赶紧离开了。","‘How can I make their acquaintance?’ was my first thought when I waked in the morning.I went out in the garden before morning tea, but I did not go too near the fence, and saw no one.After drinking tea, I walked several times up and down the street before the house, and looked into the windows from a distance....I fancied her face at a curtain, and I hurried away in alarm."
"“但是我必须要和她结识，”我边想边在涅斯库奇花园前的沙地上心烦意乱地走来走去……“可要以什么方式呢？这是个问题。”我回想起昨天相遇时的最微小的细节；不知为什么，她朝我一笑的情景我记得特别清楚……但是，就在我绞尽脑汁，想尽各种办法的时候，命运已经为我替我做了安排。","‘I must make her acquaintance, though,’ I thought, pacing distractedly about the sandy plain that stretches before Neskutchny park ... ‘but how, that is the question.’I recalled the minutest details of our meeting yesterday; I had for some reason or other a particularly vivid recollection of how she had laughed at me....But while I racked my brains, and made various plans, fate had already provided for me."
"我不在家的时候，母亲收到了一封新邻居送来的写在灰色信纸上的信，信是用棕色封蜡封口，这种封蜡是只盖在邮局通知上或是廉价酒的瓶塞上的。这封信写得不但文笔不通，而且字迹潦草。公爵夫人在信中恳请母亲以她的影响力给予帮助，用公爵夫人的话说，母亲和一些位高权重的大人物相熟，而她的命运和她孩子们的命运都掌握在这些人的手中，因为她正在打一桩非常重要的官司。她写道：“我致信给您，就像一个贵妇致信给另一个贵妇一样，为此我也非常高兴能利用这个机会。”在信的结尾，她希望母亲允许她前来拜访。我发现母亲因犹豫不决而心绪不佳：父亲不在家，她没有可以商量的人。对一个贵妇人，并且还是位公爵夫人的来信置之不理是不行的。可是该怎么回信呢？母亲犯了难。她觉得用法语回信似乎不妥，而俄语拼写又不是她的强项——这点她非常明白，也不愿暴露这个弱点。看见我回来，母亲非常高兴，叫我立刻去拜访公爵夫人并口头传达：母亲非常乐意尽力为公爵夫人效劳，并请她下午一点光临寒舍。我内心的愿望意外地马上就能实现了，这让我又惊又喜。但是，我没有露出不安的神情，我先回到自己的房间，系上新领结，穿上礼服；我在家里还穿着短上衣和翻领衫，虽然我很讨厌这样穿着。","In my absence my mother had received from her new neighbour a letter on grey paper, sealed with brown wax, such as is only used in notices from the post-office or on the corks of bottles of cheap wine.In this letter, which was written in illiterate language and in a slovenly hand, the princess begged my mother to use her powerful influence in her behalf; my mother, in the words of the princess, was very intimate with persons of high position, upon whom her fortunes and her children’s fortunes depended, as she had some very important business in hand.‘I address myself to you,’ she wrote, ‘as one gentlewoman to another gentlewoman, and for that reason am glad to avail myself of the opportunity.’Concluding, she begged my mother’s permission to call upon her.I found my mother in an unpleasant state of indecision; my father was not at home, and she had no one of whom to ask advice.Not to answer a gentlewoman, and a princess into the bargain, was impossible.But my mother was in a difficulty as to how to answer her.To write a note in French struck her as unsuitable, and Russian spelling was not a strong point with my mother herself, and she was aware of it, and did not care to expose herself.She was overjoyed when I made my appearance, and at once told me to go round to the princess’s, and to explain to her by word of mouth that my mother would always be glad to do her excellency any service within her powers, and begged her to come to see her at one o’clock.This unexpectedly rapid fulfilment of my secret desires both delighted and appalled me.I made no sign, however, of the perturbation which came over me, and as a preliminary step went to my own room to put on a new necktie and tail coat; at home I still wore short jackets and lay-down collars, much as I abominated them."
"第四章","CHAPTER IV"
"我走进了狭窄凌乱的厢房过道，情不自禁地浑身发颤。一位头发灰白的老仆人接待了我，他有着古铜色的黑脸庞，乖戾的像猪一样的小眼睛，额头和鬓角都长满了我这辈子都没见过的那么深的皱纹。他端着一个盛着吃得只剩鲱鱼脊骨的盘子，用脚带上了通向房间的门，断断续续地说：“你有什么事？”","In the narrow and untidy passage of the lodge, which I entered with an involuntary tremor in all my limbs, I was met by an old grey-headed servant with a dark copper-coloured face, surly little pig’s eyes, and such deep furrows on his forehead and temples as I had never beheld in my life.He was carrying a plate containing the spine of a herring that had been gnawed at; and shutting the door that led into the room with his foot, he jerked out, ‘What do you want?’"
"“请问扎谢金娜公爵夫人在家吗？”我问道。","‘Is the Princess Zasyekin at home?’I inquired."
"“沃尼法提！”一个刺耳的女人声音从里面传出来。","‘Vonifaty!’ a jarring female voice screamed from within."
"老仆人什么也没说，转过身去，背对着我，他那件磨损得很厉害的制服后背露了出来，制服破得只剩下一颗孤零零的、有纹章的红色纽扣，他把盘子放在地板上就离开了。","The man without a word turned his back on me, exhibiting as he did so the extremely threadbare hindpart of his livery with a solitary reddish heraldic button on it; he put the plate down on the floor, and went away."
"“你去过警察局了吗？”仍是那个女人的声音问道。老仆人含糊地回答了些什么。“哦……谁来了？”又是那个女人的声音……“邻居家的公子。好，请他进来吧。”","‘Did you go to the police station?’ the same female voice called again.The man muttered something in reply.‘Eh... Has some one come?’I heard again…‘The young gentleman from next door.Ask him in, then.’"
"老仆人又出现在我面前，说：“请进客厅吧，”然后捡起了地板上的盘子。我控制了一下情绪，进了客厅。","‘Will you step into the drawing-room?’ said the servant, making his appearance once more, and picking up the plate from the floor.I mastered my emotions, and went into the drawing-room."
"我发现身处的这间客厅既狭小又不十分整洁，房间里家具简陋，好像是匆忙中布置的。靠窗那张坏了一只扶手的安乐椅里坐着一位五十岁左右的妇人，她没戴头巾，相貌丑陋，身着一件绿色的旧裙子，脖子上围着一条毛绒条纹围巾。她那双黑色的小眼睛一个劲地盯着我。","I found myself in a small and not over clean apartment, containing some poor furniture that looked as if it had been hurriedly set down where it stood.At the window in an easy-chair with a broken arm was sitting a woman of fifty, bareheaded and ugly, in an old green dress, and a striped worsted wrap about her neck.Her small black eyes fixed me like pins."
"我走到她面前，行了个礼。","I went up to her and bowed."
"“我能有幸与扎谢金娜公爵夫人谈几句话吗？”","‘I have the honour of addressing the Princess Zasyekin?’"
"“我就是扎谢金娜公爵夫人，您就是弗先生的儿子吗？”","‘I am the Princess Zasyekin; and you are the son of Mr. V.?’"
"“是的。我母亲让我给您回个话。”","‘Yes.I have come to you with a message from my mother.’"
"“请坐。沃尼法提，我的钥匙在哪儿，你见过吗？”","‘Sit down, please.Vonifaty, where are my keys, have you seen them?’"
"我向扎谢金娜夫人转达了母亲对她来信的答复。她边听我说，边用她那粗红的手指敲打着窗户玻璃，等我说完了，她又凝视着我。","I communicated to Madame Zasyekin my mother’s reply to her note.She heard me out, drumming with her fat red fingers on the window-pane, and when I had finished, she stared at me once more."
"“很好，我一定会去的。”最后她说了一句。“您真年轻啊！您多大了，我能问问吗？”","‘Very good; I’ll be sure to come,’ she observed at last.‘But how young you are!How old are you, may I ask?’"
"“16岁了。”我不由自主结结巴巴地答道。","’Sixteen,’ I replied, with an involuntary stammer."
"公爵夫人从她的口袋里抽出几张写满字的、油迹斑斑的纸，举到鼻子下面翻阅了起来。","The princess drew out of her pocket some greasy papers covered with writing, raised them right up to her nose, and began looking through them."
"“好年华。”她突然说，并在椅子里不停地扭动身子。“请随便些。在我家不必拘礼。”","‘A good age,’ she ejaculated suddenly, turning round restlessly on her chair.‘And do you, pray, make yourself at home.I don’t stand on ceremony.’"
"“的确是不拘礼。”我心想，不禁厌恶地打量着她那让人反感的体态。","‘No, indeed,’ I thought, scanning her unprepossessing person with a disgust I could not restrain."
"就在这时，客厅的另一扇门倏地打开了，门口站着我昨晚在花园里见过的那个少女。她抬起一只手，脸上掠过一丝嘲笑。","At that instant another door flew open quickly, and in the doorway stood the girl I had seen the previous evening in the garden.She lifted her hand, and a mocking smile gleamed in her face."
"“这是我女儿。”公爵夫人用胳膊肘指指她说。“齐诺奇卡，这是我们邻居弗先生的公子。我能问问您的名字吗？”","‘Here is my daughter,’ observed the princess, indicating her with her elbow.‘Zinotchka, the son of our neighbour, Mr. V. What is your name, allow me to ask?’"
"“弗拉基米尔。”我站了起来，激动得结结巴巴地答道。","‘Vladimir,’ I answered, getting up, and stuttering in my excitement."
"“请问您父亲的尊姓大名？”","‘And your father’s name?’"
"“彼得洛维奇。”","‘Petrovitch.’"
"“啊！我认识一位警察局长也叫弗拉基米尔·彼得洛维奇。沃尼法提！别找钥匙了！钥匙就在我口袋里呢。”","‘Ah!I used to know a commissioner of police whose name was Vladimir Petrovitch too.Vonifaty! don’t look for my keys; the keys are in my pocket.’"
"那少女脸上带着刚才的笑容，轻轻地眨了眨眼睛，头微微倾向一侧，仍旧看着我。","The young girl was still looking at me with the same smile, faintly fluttering her eyelids, and putting her head a little on one side."
"“我已经见过沃尔德玛先生了。”她开腔了。（她的声音像银铃一般，如同一阵让人愉快的冷气掠过我的全身。）“我可以这么叫您吗？”","‘I have seen Monsieur Voldemar before,’ she began.(The silvery note of her voice ran through me with a sort of sweet shiver.)‘You will let me call you so?’"
"“哦，当然。”我支吾地说。","‘Oh, please,’ I faltered."
"“在哪儿见过的？”公爵夫人问道。","‘Where was that?’ asked the princess."
"公爵小姐并没有回答她的母亲。","The young princess did not answer her mother."
"“您眼下有什么事吗？”她问，仍然没有把目光从我身上移开。","‘Have you anything to do just now?’ she said, not taking her eyes off me."
"“嗯，没有。”","‘Oh, no.’"
"“您愿意帮我缠毛线吗？过来，到我这儿来。”","‘Would you like to help me wind some wool?Come in here, to me.’"
"她向我点头示意，然后走出了客厅。我跟着她出去了。","She nodded to me and went out of the drawing-room.I followed her."
"在我们进的那个房间里，家具稍微好点，摆放得也更讲究些。可那时我几乎什么也没能注意到：我像在梦中走着一样，感觉全身洋溢着一种近乎弱智的、紧张的幸福感。","In the room we went into, the furniture was a little better, and was arranged with more taste.Though, indeed, at the moment, I was scarcely capable of noticing anything; I moved as in a dream and felt all through my being a sort of intense blissfulness that verged on imbecility."
"公爵小姐坐了下来，取出一束红色毛线，示意我坐在她对面的一张椅子上，然后她小心地打开那团毛线，套在我的两手上。她默默地做着这一切，带着一种滑稽的从容，那微微张开的嘴角仍挂着愉快狡黠的微笑。她开始把毛线缠在一张折叠纸板上，忽然瞥了我一眼，目光明亮而迅速，让人晕眩，我不由得埋下了眼睛。当她那双通常都是半睁半闭的眼睛睁得大大的时候，她的脸完全变了个样：好像焕发出了光彩。","The young princess sat down, took out a skein of red wool and, motioning me to a seat opposite her, carefully untied the skein and laid it across my hands.All this she did in silence with a sort of droll deliberation and with the same bright sly smile on her slightly parted lips.She began to wind the wool on a bent card, and all at once she dazzled me with a glance so brilliant and rapid, that I could not help dropping my eyes.When her eyes, which were generally half closed, opened to their full extent, her face was completely transfigured; it was as though it were flooded with light."
"“您昨天是怎么看我的，沃尔德玛先生？”过了一会儿，她问我。“我猜您看不起我吧？”","‘What did you think of me yesterday, M’sieu Voldemar?’ she asked after a brief pause.‘You thought ill of me, I expect?’"
"“我……公爵小姐……我什么也没想……怎么可能呢……”我窘迫不安地答道。","‘I ... princess ... I thought nothing ... how can I?...’ I answered in confusion."
"“听着，”她答道，“您还不了解我呢。我是个很古怪的人；我希望别人永远对我讲实话。我刚听说您才十六岁，我都二十一岁了：您看，我比您大得多，所以您应该永远对我说真话……照我说的做。”她补充道。“看着我：您为什么不看我呢？”","‘Listen,’ she rejoined.‘You don’t know me yet.I’m a very strange person; I like always to be told the truth.You, I have just heard, are sixteen, and I am twenty-one: you see I’m a great deal older than you, and so you ought always to tell me the truth ... and to do what I tell you,’ she added.‘Look at me: why don’t you look at me?’"
"我更窘迫不安了，可我还是抬起眼睛看着她。她笑了，不是之前的那种笑，而是一种赞许的微笑。“看着我，”她说，亲切地压低了嗓音，“我不讨厌别人看着我……我喜欢您的脸蛋；我有一种预感，我们会成为朋友的。可是您喜欢我吗？”她俏皮地补了一句。","I was still more abashed; however, I raised my eyes to her.She smiled, not her former smile, but a smile of approbation.‘Look at me,’ she said, dropping her voice caressingly: ‘I don’t dislike that ... I like your face; I have a presentiment we shall be friends.But do you like me?’ she added slyly."
"“公爵小姐……”我刚要开口。","‘Princess ...’ I was beginning."
"“首先，您得叫我齐娜依达·亚历山德罗夫娜；其次，小孩子（她纠正道）——年轻人不把所想的直接说出来，那可不是个好习惯。大人们才能够那样。您喜欢我，是吧？”","‘In the first place, you must call me Zinaïda Alexandrovna, and in the second place it’s a bad habit for children’—(she corrected herself) ‘for young people—not to say straight out what they feel.That’s all very well for grown-up people.You like me, don’t you?’"
"虽然我很高兴她能这么坦诚地和我说话，但我还是觉得有点难过。　我想让她知道，她不是在和一个小男孩打交道，于是我竭力装出一副轻松而又严肃的样子说道：“当然了。我很喜欢您，齐娜依达·亚历山德罗夫娜，我不想隐瞒这一点。”","Though I was greatly delighted that she talked so freely to me, still I was a little hurt.I wanted to show her that she had not a mere boy to deal with, and assuming as easy and serious an air as I could, I observed, ‘Certainly.I like you very much, Zinaïda Alexandrovna; I have no wish to conceal it.’"
"她慢慢地摇了摇头。“您有家庭教师吗？”她突然问道。","She shook her head very deliberately.‘Have you a tutor?’ she asked suddenly."
"“没有，我早就没有家庭教师了。”","‘No; I’ve not had a tutor for a long, long while.’"
"我撒了谎，我的法国家庭教师离开还不到一个月。","I told a lie; it was not a month since I had parted with my Frenchman."
"“哦！那我明白了——您已完全是个大人了。”","‘Oh!I see then—you are quite grown-up.’"
"她轻轻地敲了下我的指头。“把手伸直！”然后，她就忙着卷毛线球了。","She tapped me lightly on the fingers.‘Hold your hands straight!’And she applied herself busily to winding the ball."
"我趁着她向下看的机会仔细地观察她，先是偷偷地看，然后越来越大胆了。她的面孔在我看来比昨晚更迷人了。她脸上的一切都显得那么的娇嫩、聪慧、可爱。她背对着一扇挂着白色百叶窗帘的窗子坐着，阳光透过百叶窗照射进来，柔和的光线落在她那蓬松的金色卷发上，落在她那无暇的脖颈上，落在她那微微倾斜着的肩膀和柔软平静的胸脯上。我凝视着她，对我来说她是多么珍贵、多么亲近啊！感觉我与她相识已久，仿佛在认识她之前我什么也不懂，根本就没真正生活过……她穿着一件深色的、已经穿得很旧的连衣裙，围了一条围裙,我觉得我愿意亲吻这条连衣裙和围裙上的每条褶缝。她小小的鞋尖露在她的连衣裙外面，我真想爱慕地拜倒在那双鞋子前。“此刻我就坐在她面前，”我心想，“我已经认识她了……多幸福啊，天哪！”我开心得几乎要从椅子上蹦起来，但我只是摆动了几下腿，就像一个得到了蜜饯的小孩子。","I seized the opportunity when she was looking down and fell to watching her, at first stealthily, then more and more boldly.Her face struck me as even more charming than on the previous evening; everything in it was so delicate, clever, and sweet.She was sitting with her back to a window covered with a white blind, the sunshine, streaming in through the blind, shed a soft light over her fluffy golden curls, her innocent neck, her sloping shoulders, and tender untroubled bosom.I gazed at her, and how dear and near she was already to me!It seemed to me I had known her a long while and had never known anything nor lived at all till I met her....She was wearing a dark and rather shabby dress and an apron; I would gladly, I felt, have kissed every fold of that dress and apron.The tips of her little shoes peeped out from under her skirt; I could have bowed down in adoration to those shoes....‘And here I am sitting before her,’ I thought; ‘I have made acquaintance with her ... what happiness, my God!’I could hardly keep from jumping up from my chair in ecstasy, but I only swung my legs a little, like a small child who has been given sweetmeats."
"我幸福得像水里的鱼儿，希望永远呆在那间房间里，永远都不离开。","I was as happy as a fish in water, and I could have stayed in that room for ever, have never left that place."
"她慢慢地抬起眼睑，那双明亮的眸子又对我闪出了温柔的目光，她又笑了。","Her eyelids were slowly lifted, and once more her clear eyes shone kindly upon me, and again she smiled."
"“您怎么这样看着我！”她慢慢地说道，伸出了指头吓唬我。","‘How you look at me!’ she said slowly, and she held up a threatening finger."
"我羞红了脸……“她什么都知道，她什么都看出来了。”这念头闪过我的脑子。“她怎么会不懂，怎么会看不出来呢？”","I blushed ... ’She understands it all, she sees all,‘ flashed through my mind.’And how could she fail to understand and see it all?’"
"就在那时，隔壁房间突然传出来一种什么声音——是马刀的叮当声。","All at once there was a sound in the next room—the clink of a sabre."
"“齐娜！”公爵夫人在客厅里高声叫道，“别洛夫佐罗夫给你带来了一只小猫。”","‘Zina!’ screamed the princess in the drawing-room, ‘Byelovzorov has brought you a kitten.’"
"“小猫！”齐娜依达叫道，忽地一下从椅子上站了起来，把毛线团往我膝盖上一扔就跑出去了。","‘A kitten!’ cried Zinaïda, and getting up from her chair impetuously, she flung the ball of worsted on my knees and ran away."
"我也站了起来，把那束毛线和线团放在窗台上，进了客厅，随即站住了，犹豫不前。在房间的中央，趴着一只四脚张开的小花猫，齐娜依达跪在它前面，小心翼翼地抬起它的小脸。在公爵夫人旁边，站着个长着一头浅黄色卷发的年轻骑兵，他长了一张红扑扑的脸，还有鼓鼓的眼睛，他几乎占满了两扇窗子之间的全部空间。","I too got up and, laying the skein and the ball of wool on the window-sill, I went into the drawing-room and stood still, hesitating.In the middle of the room, a tabby kitten was lying with outstretched paws; Zinaïda was on her knees before it, cautiously lifting up its little face.Near the old princess, and filling up almost the whole space between the two windows, was a flaxen curly-headed young man, a hussar, with a rosy face and prominent eyes."
"“多有趣的小家伙啊！”齐娜依达说道，“它的眼睛不是灰色的，而是绿色的，多长的耳朵呀！谢谢您，维克多·叶戈雷奇！您真好。”","‘What a funny little thing!’Zinaïda was saying; ‘and its eyes are not grey, but green, and what long ears!Thank you, Viktor Yegoritch!you are very kind.’"
"我认出来了，那骑兵就是我前一天傍晚见到的几个年轻人当中的一个。他微微一笑，鞠了一躬，把马刺和马刀的链子碰得叮当作响。","The hussar, in whom I recognised one of the young men I had seen the evening before, smiled and bowed with a clink of his spurs and a jingle of the chain of his sabre."
"“您昨天高兴地说希望要一只大耳朵的小花猫……所以我弄来了。您的话就是法律哦。”他又鞠了一躬。","‘You were pleased to say yesterday that you wished to possess a tabby kitten with long ears ... so I obtained it.Your word is law.’And he bowed again."
"小猫有气无力地“喵”地叫了一声，就开始在地上嗅来嗅去。","The kitten gave a feeble mew and began sniffing the ground."
"“它饿了！”齐娜依达叫道，“沃尼法提，索尼娅！拿些牛奶来。”","‘It’s hungry!’ cried Zinaïda.‘Vonifaty, Sonia!bring some milk.’"
"一个穿着旧的黄色裙子、脖子上围了条褪色围巾的女仆端着一碟牛奶进来了，她把碟子放在小猫跟前。小猫抖了一下，眨了眨眼睛，开始舔了起来。","A maid, in an old yellow gown with a faded kerchief at her neck, came in with a saucer of milk and set it before the kitten.The kitten started, blinked, and began lapping."
"“它有粉色的小舌头！”齐娜依达说着，几乎把头贴到地上，从侧面看小猫鼻子下面的舌头。","‘What a pink little tongue it has!’ remarked Zinaïda, putting her head almost on the ground and peeping at it sideways under its very nose."
"小猫吃饱后就咕噜地叫起来，还装模作样地张开爪子。齐娜依达站了起来，漫不经心地对女仆说：“把它带走吧。”","The kitten having had enough began to purr and move its paws affectedly.Zinaïda got up, and turning to the maid said carelessly, ‘Take it away.’"
"“为了这只小猫——请给我您的一只小手。”骑兵傻笑着，扭动了一下裹在紧绷的新制服下强壮的身体。","‘For the kitten—your little hand,’ said the hussar, with a simper and a shrug of his strongly-built frame, which was tightly buttoned up in a new uniform."
"“两只手。”齐娜依达回答着，随即向他伸出了双手。当骑兵亲吻她双手的时候，她的目光越过他的肩膀落在我身上。","‘Both,’ replied Zinaïda, and she held out her hands to him.While he was kissing them, she looked at me over his shoulder."
"我站在原地一动不动，不知道是应该笑呢，还是应该说点什么，或是这样默不作声。忽然我看见我家的仆人费多尔出现在走廊里。他正向我做着手势。我木然地走过去。","I stood stockstill in the same place and did not know whether to laugh, to say something, or to be silent.Suddenly through the open door into the passage I caught sight of our footman, Fyodor.He was making signs to me.Mechanically I went out to him."
"“有什么事？”我问。","‘What do you want?’I asked."
"“您母亲派我叫您回去。”他小声地说。“您还没有带回话回家，她很生气。”","‘Your mamma has sent for you,’ he said in a whisper.’She is angry that you have not come back with the answer.’"
"“怎么我在这儿待了很久了吗？”","‘Why, have I been here long?’"
"“都一个多小时了。”","‘Over an hour.’"
"“一个多小时了！”我下意识地重复了一遍，回到客厅，鞠了一躬，碰了脚后跟致意要离开。","‘Over an hour!’I repeated unconsciously, and going back to the drawing-room I began to make bows and scrape with my heels."
"“您要去哪儿？”公爵小姐隔着骑兵望了我一眼，问道。","‘Where are you off to?’ the young princess asked, glancing at me from behind the hussar."
"“我得回家了。我会回禀家母，”我对老妇人补了句，“说您会在两点前后光临寒舍。”","‘I must go home.So I am to say,’ I added, addressing the old lady, ‘that you will come to us about two.’"
"“就这样说吧，亲爱的先生。”","‘Do you say so, my good sir.’"
"公爵夫人急忙拿出鼻烟盒，大声地吸起来，我不禁全身一震。“就这样说吧。”她重复了一遍，眨巴着噙着泪水的眼睛，还打着喷嚏。","The princess hurriedly pulled out her snuff-box and took snuff so loudly that I positively jumped.‘Do you say so,’ she repeated, blinking tearfully and sneezing."
"我又鞠了个躬，转身走出了房间，脊背上感到非常不自在，年轻人当知道背后有人看着他时，就会有这种感觉。","I bowed once more, turned, and went out of the room with that sensation of awkwardness in my spine which a very young man feels when he knows he is being looked at from behind."
"“沃尔德玛先生，请常过来看看我们。”齐娜依达说道，又笑了起来。","‘Mind you come and see us again, M’sieu Voldemar,’ Zinaïda called, and she laughed again."
"“她怎么总是笑呢？”我心想着，费多尔陪着我走回了家，他什么都没说，只是带着一种不赞成的神情一直跟在我身后。母亲责骂了我，她奇怪我在公爵夫人家做什么呆了这么久。我没有回答她，回了自己的房间。我突然感到很伤心……强忍着不哭……我嫉妒那个骑兵。","‘Why is it she’s always laughing?’I thought, as I went back home escorted by Fyodor, who said nothing to me, but walked behind me with an air of disapprobation.My mother scolded me and wondered what ever I could have been doing so long at the princess’s.I made her no reply and went off to my own room.I felt suddenly very sad....I tried hard not to cry....I was jealous of the hussar."
"第五章","CHAPTER V"
"公爵夫人如约拜访了我母亲，但母亲对她印象并不好。她们见面时我并不在场，但在吃饭时母亲告诉父亲，这位扎谢金娜公爵夫人给她的感觉似乎很粗俗，并且十分让她厌烦，因为公爵夫人请求她在谢尔盖公爵面前替她说情，还说扎谢金娜公爵夫人似乎有打不完官司，处理不完的纠纷——都是肮脏的金钱交易——她一定是个爱惹麻烦、好打官司的人。不过，母亲补充了一句，她已经邀请公爵夫人和她的女儿明天来吃饭（听到“女儿”这个词，我赶紧埋头吃饭），毕竟她是邻居，也算是有名望的人。听到这里，父亲对母亲说，他现在想起来这位夫人是谁了；说他在年轻的时候就认识已故的扎谢金公爵——受过良好的教育，但却轻率肤浅、荒唐愚蠢；又说他在巴黎住过很长一阵子，因此在社交圈得了个绰号“巴黎人”；他从前非常富有，但是赌光了所有财产；“不知道为什么，也许是为了钱，不过他本可以找个更好的人，”父亲冷笑了一下继续道，“他娶了个经纪人的女儿，婚后就开始做投机生意，生活就彻底毁掉了。”","The princess called on my mother as she had promised and made a disagreeable impression on her.I was not present at their interview, but at table my mother told my father that this Prince Zasyekin struck her as a femme très vulgaire, that she had quite worn her out begging her to interest Prince Sergei in their behalf, that she seemed to have no end of lawsuits and affairs on hand—de vilaines affaires d‘argent—and must be a very troublesome and litigious person.My mother added, however, that she had asked her and her daughter to dinner the next day (hearing the word ’daughter’ I buried my nose in my plate), for after all she was a neighbour and a person of title.Upon this my father informed my mother that he remembered now who this lady was; that he had in his youth known the deceased Prince Zasyekin, a very well-bred, but frivolous and absurd person; that he had been nicknamed in society ‘le Parisien,’ from having lived a long while in Paris; that he had been very rich, but had gambled away all his property; and for some unknown reason, probably for money, though indeed he might have chosen better, if so, my father added with a cold smile, he had married the daughter of an agent, and after his marriage had entered upon speculations and ruined himself utterly."
"母亲说：“只要她不想试着借钱就行。”","‘If only she doesn’t try to borrow money,’ observed my mother."
"“那倒是非常可能。”父亲平静地说。“她说法语吗？”","‘That’s exceedingly possible,’ my father responded tranquilly.‘Does she speak French?’"
"“说得非常糟。”","‘Very badly.’"
"“嗯。这也无所谓。你好像说过你也邀请了她的女儿；有人对我说过她倒是个非常可爱、有教养的女孩。”","‘H’m.It’s of no consequence anyway.I think you said you had asked the daughter too; some one was telling me she was a very charming and cultivated girl.’"
"“啊！那她倒不像她母亲。”","‘Ah!Then she can’t take after her mother.’"
"“也不像她父亲，”父亲接口道，“虽然他确实受过教育，但很蠢。”","‘Nor her father either,’ rejoined my father.‘He was cultivated indeed, but a fool.’"
"母亲叹了口气，陷入了沉思。父亲也不再说什么了。他们谈话时，我觉得非常不自在。","My mother sighed and sank into thought.My father said no more.I felt very uncomfortable during this conversation."
"晚饭后，我去了花园，但没带枪。我发过誓，再也不走近扎谢金家的花园，但是一种无法抗拒的力量又促使我走到那儿去，这一次没白来。我还没走到栅栏那儿，就看到了齐娜依达。这次只有她一个人。她手里捧着本书，沿着小径慢慢走过来。她没有注意到我。","After dinner I went into the garden, but without my gun.I swore to myself that I would not go near the Zasyekins’ garden, but an irresistible force drew me thither, and not in vain.I had hardly reached the fence when I caught sight of Zinaïda.This time she was alone.She held a book in her hands, and was coming slowly along the path.She did not notice me."
"我几乎就让她过去了；可突然我改了主意，咳嗽了一声。","I almost let her pass by; but all at once I changed my mind and coughed."
"她转过身，但没停下来，一只手把圆草帽边的蓝色宽丝带撩到一边，看了我一眼，慢慢地笑了一下，又垂下眼睛看起书来。","She turned round, but did not stop, pushed back with one hand the broad blue ribbon of her round straw hat, looked at me, smiled slowly, and again bent her eyes on the book."
"我摘下帽子，犹豫了一会儿，心情沉重地走开了。“对她来说，我算什么？”我用法语想着（天晓得为什么）。","I took off my cap, and after hesitating a moment, walked away with a heavy heart.‘Que suis-je pour elle?’I thought (God knows why) in French."
"熟悉的脚步声在我身后响起；我转身一看，父亲迈着轻快的步子朝我走来。","Familiar footsteps sounded behind me; I looked round, my father came up to me with his light, rapid walk."
"“这位就是公爵小姐吗？”父亲问我。","‘Is that the young princess?’ he asked me."
"“是的。”","‘Yes.’"
"“怎么，你认识她？”","‘Why, do you know her?’"
"“今天早上在我公爵夫人那儿见过她。”","‘I saw her this morning at the princess’s.’"
"父亲站住了，突然转身，往回走了。当他赶上齐娜依达时，礼貌地向她鞠了一躬。齐娜依达也向他鞠了一躬，脸上露出惊讶的神情，放下了书。我看见她目送父亲离去。父亲穿着一贯得体，简单大方又别具一格；可在我看来他的身姿从没有像今天这样优雅，他那已显稀疏的卷发上戴着的灰色帽子从没有像今天这样合适。","My father stopped, and, turning sharply on his heel, went back.When he was on a level with Zinaïda, he made her a courteous bow.She, too, bowed to him, with some astonishment on her face, and dropped her book.I saw how she looked after him.My father was always irreproachably dressed, simple and in a style of his own; but his figure had never struck me as more graceful, never had his grey hat sat more becomingly on his curls, which were scarcely perceptibly thinner than they had once been."
"我转身向齐娜依达走去，但她连看都没看我一眼，又捧起书转身走开了。","I bent my steps toward Zinaïda, but she did not even glance at me; she picked up her book again and went away."
"第六章","CHAPTER VI"
"那天的整个晚上和之后的一整天，我都是在沮丧和失落中度过的。我记得我试着学习，拿起卡伊达诺夫的教科书，但是这本著名的教科书上印刷得醒目的每行字、每一页只是白白地在我眼前闪过。有句话我读了十遍：“朱利叶斯·凯撒以勇猛好战著称。”我什么都读不懂，索性把书扔到了一边。吃晚饭前，我又抹了发油，穿上晚礼服，戴上领结。","The whole evening and the following day I spent in a sort of dejected apathy.I remember I tried to work and took up Keidanov, but the boldly printed lines and pages of the famous text-book passed before my eyes in vain.I read ten times over the words: ‘Julius Caesar was distinguished by warlike courage.’I did not understand anything and threw the book aside.Before dinner-time I pomaded myself once more, and once more put on my tail-coat and necktie."
"“这是为什么？”母亲问，“你还不是个大学生呢，天知道你能不能通过考试。再说前不久不是给你做了一件新夹克吗！别又把它扔到一边不穿！”","‘What’s that for?’ my mother demanded.‘You’re not a student yet, and God knows whether you’ll get through the examination.And you’ve not long had a new jacket!You can’t throw it away!’"
"“有客人要来。”我几乎绝望地嘟囔着。","‘There will be visitors,’ I murmured almost in despair."
"“胡说八道！都是些什么客人！”","‘What nonsense!fine visitors indeed!’"
"我只好服从。我换下礼服穿上夹克，但并没摘下领结。晚饭的半个小时前，公爵夫人和她女儿来了；除了穿着我上次已经见过的那件绿裙子，这位老妇人还披了件黄色披肩，戴着一顶饰有火红色丝带的旧式帽子。她马上就谈起了她经济上的困难，唉声叹气，抱怨着自己的贫穷，恳求得到帮助，一点也不拘束；她大声地吸鼻烟，而且像往常一样懒洋洋地在椅子里扭来扭去，坐不安定。她似乎从来没意识到自己是位公爵夫人。可齐娜依达却显得非常严肃，她的举止近乎傲慢，一副十足的公爵小姐派头。她冷若冰霜，脸上留露出庄重尊贵的神情。我都觉得不认识她了，也不熟悉她的笑容和目光了，虽然她以这种新姿态出现我觉得也很优雅。她身穿一件带有浅蓝色花朵的轻纱连衣裙；她的头发是英国流行的样式，长长的卷儿沿着两颊梳垂下来；这种发型倒是和她冷若冰霜的神情很相称。吃饭时，父亲就坐在她旁边，以他独有的精致而平静的礼节招待着他的邻居。他时不时地看看她，她也时不时地望向父亲，但是目光却如此地古怪，甚至带有些敌意。他们用法语交谈；我记得齐娜依达纯正的口音让我很惊讶。我们在用餐时公爵夫人仍不顾礼节；她大吃大喝，还赞扬饭菜的美味。母亲明显被她惹烦了，用一种不耐烦的冷淡态度应付着她；父亲时不时地稍稍皱下眉头。母亲也不喜欢齐娜依达。“一个傲慢自负的轻佻女子，”第二天她说，“想想看，她有什么可骄傲的，长着一副轻佻女工的面孔！”","I had to submit.I changed my tail-coat for my jacket, but I did not take off the necktie.The princess and her daughter made their appearance half an hour before dinner-time; the old lady had put on, in addition to the green dress with which I was already acquainted, a yellow shawl, and an old-fashioned cap adorned with flame-coloured ribbons.She began talking at once about her money difficulties, sighing, complaining of her poverty, and imploring assistance, but she made herself at home; she took snuff as noisily, and fidgeted and lolled about in her chair as freely as ever.It never seemed to have struck her that she was a princess.Zinaïda on the other hand was rigid, almost haughty in her demeanour, every inch a princess.There was a cold immobility and dignity in her face.I should not have recognised it; I should not have known her smiles, her glances, though I thought her exquisite in this new aspect too.She wore a light barége dress with pale blue flowers on it; her hair fell in long curls down her cheek in the English fashion; this style went well with the cold expression of her face.My father sat beside her during dinner, and entertained his neighbour with the finished and serene courtesy peculiar to him.He glanced at her from time to time, and she glanced at him, but so strangely, almost with hostility.Their conversation was carried on in French; I was surprised, I remember, at the purity of Zinaïda’s accent.The princess, while we were at table, as before made no ceremony; she ate a great deal, and praised the dishes.My mother was obviously bored by her, and answered her with a sort of weary indifference; my father faintly frowned now and then.My mother did not like Zinaïda either.‘A conceited minx,’ she said next day.‘And fancy, what she has to be conceited about, avec sa mine de grisette!’"
"“很显然你还从没见过女工。”父亲对她说道。","‘It’s clear you have never seen any grisettes,’ my father observed to her."
"“谢天谢地，我可没见过。”","‘Thank God, I haven’t!’"
"“谢天谢地，当然……那你怎么能对她们妄下评论呢？”","‘Thank God, to be sure ... only how can you form an opinion of them, then?’"
"齐娜依达压根就没注意过我。饭后不久公爵夫人就起身告辞了。","To me Zinaïda had paid no attention whatever.Soon after dinner the princess got up to go."
"“我希望得到你们的好心相助，玛利亚·尼古拉耶夫娜和彼得·瓦西里耶维奇。”她拖着悲凉的声调对我父母说，“我这也是没有办法！好日子是有的，但都过去了。我倒是个公爵夫人，不过一个穷头衔，又不能当饭吃！”","‘I shall rely on your kind offices, Maria Nikolaevna and Piotr Vassilitch,’ she said in a doleful sing-song to my mother and father.‘I’ve no help for it!There were days, but they are over.Here I am, an excellency, and a poor honour it is with nothing to eat!’"
"父亲礼貌地向她鞠了一躬，送她走到了大厅门口。我穿着短上衣站在那儿，眼睛盯着地板，像是个被判了死刑的犯人一样。齐娜依达对我不理不睬，彻底击溃了我。但让我吃惊的是当她经过我身边时，她的眼睛里又流露出之前那种友善的神情，匆忙地悄声对我说：“晚上八点到我们那儿去，听到没，一定……”我只是将两手一摊，但她已经将白头巾披在头上，离开了。","My father made her a respectful bow and escorted her to the door of the hall.I was standing there in my short jacket, staring at the floor, like a man under sentence of death.Zinaïda’s treatment of me had crushed me utterly.What was my astonishment, when, as she passed me, she whispered quickly with her former kind expression in her eyes: ‘Come to see us at eight, do you hear, be sure....’I simply threw up my hands, but already she was gone, flinging a white scarf over her head."
"第七章","CHAPTER VII"
"八点整，我穿着正礼服，把额上的头发梳得高耸一些，然后走进了公爵夫人所住的厢房的前厅。那个老仆人生气地看了我一眼，不情愿地从长椅上站了起来。客厅里传出阵阵欢快的笑声。我推开了门，不禁惊讶得后退了几步。公爵小姐站在房间中央的一张椅子上，胸前手里拿着一顶男式帽子；椅子四周挤着五六个男人。他们都试图把手伸进帽子里去，可她却把帽子举在他们头顶，使劲地晃着。一看见我，她大叫道：“等一下，等一下，又来了位客人，他也得有张卡片。”然后，她从椅子上轻盈地跳下，一把抓住我衣服的袖口，说道：“您干站着干嘛？先生们，让我来给你们介绍一下：这位是沃尔德玛先生，是邻居家的少爷。而这位，”她转向我，依次指着她的客人，继续道，“马列夫斯基伯爵，卢申医生，诗人马依达诺夫，已经退伍的上尉尼尔马茨基，骑兵别洛夫佐罗夫，您已经见过他了。我希望你们能成为好朋友。”我糊里糊涂的，甚至都没对任何一个人点头行礼；我认出了卢申医生，他就是那个皮肤黝黑，曾经在花园里让我非常难堪的人；其他人我都不认识。","At eight o’clock precisely, in my tail-coat and with my hair brushed up into a tuft on my head, I entered the passage of the lodge, where the princess lived.The old servant looked crossly at me and got up unwillingly from his bench.There was a sound of merry voices in the drawing-room.I opened the door and fell back in amazement.In the middle of the room was the young princess, standing on a chair, holding a man’s hat in front of her; round the chair crowded some half a dozen men.They were trying to put their hands into the hat, while she held it above their heads, shaking it violently.On seeing me, she cried, ’Stay, stay, another guest, he must have a ticket too,’ and leaping lightly down from the chair she took me by the cuff of my coat ‘Come along,’ she said, ‘why are you standing still?Messieurs, let me make you acquainted: this is M’sieu Voldemar, the son of our neighbour.And this,’ she went on, addressing me, and indicating her guests in turn, ‘Count Malevsky, Doctor Lushin, Meidanov the poet, the retired captain Nirmatsky, and Byelovzorov the hussar, whom you’ve seen already.I hope you will be good friends.’I was so confused that I did not even bow to any one; in Doctor Lushin I recognised the dark man who had so mercilessly put me to shame in the garden; the others were unknown to me."
"“伯爵！”齐娜依达继续说，“给沃尔德玛先生写张卡片。”","‘Count!’ continued Zinaïda, ‘write M’sieu Voldemar a ticket.’"
"“这不公平，”伯爵带着轻微的波兰口音反驳道，这是一位长相十分英俊，穿着时髦，一头黑发的美男子，他有一双富有感情的棕色眼睛和白皙细长的鼻子，薄薄的嘴上留着一撮修剪精致的小胡子。“这位先生还没有和我们玩过罚物游戏呢。”","‘That’s not fair,’ was objected in a slight Polish accent by the count, a very handsome and fashionably dressed brunette, with expressive brown eyes, a thin little white nose, and delicate little moustaches over a tiny mouth.‘This gentleman has not been playing forfeits with us.’"
"“不公平，”别洛夫佐罗夫和那位被称为退伍上尉的先生一同重复地和道，这位先生约有四十来岁，长着一脸吓人的麻子，头发卷得像黑人，驼着背，罗圈腿，穿着一件没有肩章，纽扣松开的军服。","‘It’s unfair,’ repeated in chorus Byelovzorov and the gentleman described as a retired captain, a man of forty, pock-marked to a hideous degree, curly-headed as a negro, round-shouldered, bandy-legged, and dressed in a military coat without epaulets, worn unbuttoned."
"“给他写张卡片，我告诉你了，”公爵小姐重复道，“为什么要反对？沃尔德玛先生是第一次和我们玩，他还不用遵守规则。别发牢骚啦，写吧，我希望这样。”","‘Write him a ticket, I tell you,’ repeated the young princess.‘What’s this mutiny?M’sieu Voldemar is with us for the first time, and there are no rules for him yet.It’s no use grumbling—write it, I wish it.’"
"伯爵耸了耸肩，但是顺从地点点头，用那只白皙的、戴了几个戒指的手拿起钢笔，撕下一张小纸片，在上面写了起来。","The count shrugged his shoulders but bowed submissively, took the pen in his white, ring-bedecked fingers, tore off a scrap of paper and wrote on it."
"“至少让我们向沃尔德玛先生解释下我们在玩什么，”卢申用嘲笑的口吻开腔了，“要不然他会惊慌失措的。看见了吗，年轻人，我们在玩罚物游戏呢；公爵小姐要受罚了，抓到幸运签的人有权利吻她的手。我告诉你的这些话你懂了吗？”","‘At least let us explain to Mr. Voldemar what we are about,’ Lushin began in a sarcastic voice, ‘or else he will be quite lost.Do you see, young man, we are playing forfeits?the princess has to pay a forfeit, and the one who draws the lucky lot is to have the privilege of kissing her hand.Do you understand what I’ve told you?’"
"我只是呆呆地看着他，还是迷惑地站在那儿一动不动，而公爵小姐又跳上了椅子，开始抖动帽子。大家都向她伸出手，我也跟在他们后面。","I simply stared at him, and continued to stand still in bewilderment, while the young princess jumped up on the chair again, and again began waving the hat.They all stretched up to her, and I went after the rest."
"“马伊达诺夫，”公爵小姐对一位个子高高的年轻人说道，这位年轻人面庞消瘦，一双目光黯淡的小眼睛，长着一头出奇乌黑的头发，“你作为诗人应该大度点，把你的卡片给沃尔德玛先生，那样他就有两次机会而不是一次了。”","‘Meidanov,’ said the princess to a tall young man with a thin face, little dim-sighted eyes, and exceedingly long black hair, ‘you as a poet ought to be magnanimous, and give up your number to M’sieu Voldemar so that he may have two chances instead of one.’"
"但是马伊达诺夫摇了摇头拒绝了，扬起了头发。我继众人之后把手伸进帽子，然后打开了我抽的纸片……天啊！当我看到上面写着“吻”字的时候，不禁喜出望外。","But Meidanov shook his head in refusal, and tossed his hair.After all the others I put my hand into the hat, and unfolded my lot....Heavens! what was my condition when I saw on it the word, Kiss!"
"“吻！”我情不自禁地大声叫了出来。","‘Kiss!’I could not help crying aloud."
"“好哇！他抽中了，”公爵小姐紧接着说，“我太高兴了！”她从椅子上下来，眼中闪着光芒，甜甜地瞥了我一眼，我的心怦怦直跳。“您高兴吗？”她问我。","‘Bravo!he has won it,’ the princess said quickly.‘How glad I am!’She came down from the chair and gave me such a bright sweet look, that my heart bounded.‘Are you glad?’ she asked me."
"“我？……”我结巴了。","‘Me?’ ... I faltered."
"“把您的纸片卖给我。”别洛夫佐罗夫突然凑近我耳朵低声说，“我会给您100卢布。”","’Sell me your lot,‘ Byelovzorov growled suddenly just in my ear.’I’ll give you a hundred roubles.’"
"我以愤怒的神情回答了这位骑兵，齐娜依达拍手叫好，卢申则大声喊道：“好小伙子！”","I answered the hussar with such an indignant look, that Zinaïda clapped her hands, while Lushin cried, ‘He’s a fine fellow!’"
"“可是作为司仪，”他继续说，“应该让大家遵守所有规则。沃尔德玛先生，您要单膝跪下。这是我们的规矩。”","‘But, as master of the ceremonies,’ he went on, ‘it’s my duty to see that all the rules are kept.M’sieu Voldemar, go down on one knee.That is our regulation.’"
"齐娜依达就站在我面前，头稍稍向一侧倾着，为了更清楚地看着我；她庄重地朝我伸出了手。我眼前像是蒙了一层雾；我本想单膝跪下，却两条腿都跪了下来，我的嘴唇笨拙地吻在她的手上，不小心让她的指尖划了一下。","Zinaïda stood in front of me, her head a little on one side as though to get a better look at me; she held out her hand to me with dignity.A mist passed before my eyes; I meant to drop on one knee, sank on both, and pressed my lips to Zinaïda’s fingers so awkwardly that I scratched myself a little with the tip of her nail."
"“做得好！”卢申大叫一声，边扶我站了起来。","‘Well done!’ cried Lushin, and helped me to get up."
"我们继续玩着罚物游戏。齐娜依达让我坐在她旁边。她想出来各种不寻常的惩罚。她发明的惩罚中有一项扮演“雕塑”，她挑中面容丑陋的尼尔马茨基做基座，让他弯下腰拱起身子，把头贴到胸前。笑声一刻也没有停过。对我而言，一个在规规矩矩的庄园中孤单长大的男孩，这些吵闹和喧哗，这些不拘礼节的、甚至有些放浪形骸的狂欢，这种和陌生人的交往，简直让人陶醉。我头晕脑转的，就像喝了酒一样。我开始说笑，声音比其他人都大，就连坐在隔壁房间的老公爵夫人都特意过来看我，她正在和一个从特维尔斯基门来的什么小官员讨论官司的事。但我却觉得那么幸福，对其他任何事情都不在意，我丝毫不在乎别人嘲笑或怀疑的眼神。齐娜依达仍然对我青睐有加，让我留在她身边。一次受罚中，我得坐在她旁边，我们两人都把头藏在一块丝绸手帕下：我要告诉她我的秘密。我记得我们两人的头忽然笼罩在一种温暖、半透明而芬芳的昏暗中，她眼里温柔、亲切的光芒在昏暗中闪烁，她微微张开的嘴唇中呼出热气，她的牙齿闪闪发亮，她的发梢触得我痒痒的，简直让我浑身燃烧起来。我沉默不语了。她狡猾而神秘地笑了笑，最后悄声对我说：“嘿，怎么样？”但我只是涨红了脸，笑了笑，转过头去，几乎都喘不上气来了。我们玩腻了罚物游戏——开始玩一种绳子游戏了。我的天啊！当我不注意的时候，她使劲地猛地打了一下我的指尖，这让我喜不自禁，之后不论我怎么装作心不在焉的样子，她也只是嘲弄着我，就是不碰我向她伸出的双手了。我们那晚什么都玩了！我们弹钢琴、唱歌、跳舞、扮成赶篷车的茨冈人。尼尔马茨基被打扮成一只熊，还被迫喝盐水。马列夫斯基伯爵向我们表演了好几种纸牌戏法，最后还表演了惠斯特纸牌，他把牌洗了一遍，将所有的王牌都抓到自己的手里，为此卢申“荣幸地向他祝贺”。马达伊诺夫向我们朗诵了他的长诗《凶手》的片段（事情发生在浪漫主义的鼎盛时期），这首诗他打算用全黑色封面，血红的书名出版；他们把那个小官吏膝头放着的帽子偷来，让他跳库萨克舞来赎回去；他们让老沃尼法提戴上女士帽子，还让公爵小姐戴上男式帽子……我们玩的游戏不胜枚举。只有别洛夫佐罗夫越来越靠进角落里，沉下脸，生起气来……有时他双眼看起来充满血丝，全身都激动不已，而且看起来好像随时都会冲向我们，把我们当碎木片一样四处乱扔；但是公爵小姐会瞥他几眼，朝他摇摇手指，他就又退回到角落了。","The game of forfeits went on.Zinaïda sat me down beside her.She invented all sorts of extraordinary forfeits!She had among other things to represent a ‘statue', and she chose as a pedestal the hideous Nirmatsky, told him to bow down in an arch, and bend his head down on his breast.The laughter never paused for an instant.For me, a boy constantly brought up in the seclusion of a dignified manor-house, all this noise and uproar, this unceremonious, almost riotous gaiety, these relations with unknown persons, were simply intoxicating.My head went round, as though from wine.I began laughing and talking louder than the others, so much so that the old princess, who was sitting in the next room with some sort of clerk from the Tversky gate, invited by her for consultation on business, positively came in to look at me.But I felt so happy that I did not mind anything, I didn’t care a straw for any one’s jeers, or dubious looks.Zinaïda continued to show me a preference, and kept me at her side.In one forfeit, I had to sit by her, both hidden under one silk handkerchief: I was to tell her my secret.I remember our two heads being all at once in a warm, half-transparent, fragrant darkness, the soft, close brightness of her eyes in the dark, and the burning breath from her parted lips, and the gleam of her teeth and the ends of her hair tickling me and setting me on fire.I was silent.She smiled slyly and mysteriously, and at last whispered to me, ’Well, what is it?‘ but I merely blushed and laughed, and turned away, catching my breath.We got tired of forfeits—we began to play a game with a string.My God!what were my transports when, for not paying attention, I got a sharp and vigorous slap on my fingers from her, and how I tried afterwards to pretend that I was absent-minded, and she teased me, and would not touch the hands I held out to her!What didn’t we do that evening!We played the piano, and sang and danced and acted a gypsy encampment.Nirmatsky was dressed up as a bear, and made to drink salt water.Count Malevsky showed us several sorts of card tricks, and finished, after shuffling the cards, by dealing himself all the trumps at whist, on which Lushin ‘had the honour of congratulating him'.Meidanov recited portions from his poem 'The Manslayer' (romanticism was at its height at this period), which he intended to bring out in a black cover with the title in blood-red letters; they stole the clerk’s cap off his knee, and made him dance a Cossack dance by way of ransom for it; they dressed up old Vonifaty in a woman’s cap, and the young princess put on a man’s hat....I could not enumerate all we did.Only Byelovzorov kept more and more in the background, scowling and angry....Sometimes his eyes looked bloodshot, he flushed all over, and it seemed every minute as though he would rush out upon us all and scatter us like shavings in all directions; but the young princess would glance at him, and shake her finger at him, and he would retire into his corner again."
"最后我们都玩得精疲力尽。虽然老公爵夫人，就像她自己说的，怎么吵闹都不会厌烦，到最后也感到疲倦了，想要清静。午夜十二点，晚餐准备好了，一片不新鲜的干奶酪，几个碎火腿做馅儿的冷馅饼，可这些比我尝过的任何馅饼都美味；酒只有一瓶，而且还非常奇怪：瓶子是深色宽口的，酒是桃红色的；然而却没有一个人喝。我离开厢房时累极了，被幸福冲昏了头脑；分别时，齐娜依达热情地握住了我的手，又朝我神秘地笑了笑。","We were quite worn out at last.Even the old princess, though she was ready for anything, as she expressed it, and no noise wearied her, felt tired at last, and longed for peace and quiet.At twelve o’clock at night, supper was served, consisting of a piece of stale dry cheese, and some cold turnovers of minced ham, which seemed to me more delicious than any pastry I had ever tasted; there was only one bottle of wine, and that was a strange one; a dark-coloured bottle with a wide neck, and the wine in it was of a pink hue; no one drank it, however.Tired out and faint with happiness, I left the lodge; at parting Zinaïda pressed my hand warmly, and again smiled mysteriously."
"夜晚沉闷而潮湿的气息朝我热辣辣的脸上扑来；一场暴风雨似乎蓄势来临，黑色的暴风云聚集，慢慢地布满天空，那如烟雾般的轮廓快速地改变着。一阵风在漆黑的树丛中不安地颤栗着，在地平线远方的某处，一阵阵闷雷好像对自己愤怒地发出低声怨语。","The night air was heavy and damp in my heated face; a storm seemed to be gathering; black stormclouds grew and crept across the sky, their smoky outlines visibly changing.A gust of wind shivered restlessly in the dark trees, and somewhere, far away on the horizon, muffled thunder angrily muttered as it were to itself."
"我从后面的台阶偷偷回到自己的房间里。我的老仆人正睡在地板上，我不得不从他的身上跨过去；他醒了，一看到我就对我说，我母亲又对我非常地生气，本想打发人再去找我回来，但是父亲阻止了她。（我从来没有不对母亲道声晚安，并要求她祝福我就上床睡觉的。现在也没有办法了！）","I made my way up to my room by the back stairs.My old man-nurse was asleep on the floor, and I had to step over him; he waked up, saw me, and told me that my mother had again been very angry with me, and had wished to send after me again, but that my father had prevented her.(I had never gone to bed without saying good-night to my mother, and asking her blessing.There was no help for it now!)"
"我告诉老仆人我会自己脱衣睡觉的，并吹灭了蜡烛。但是我没有脱衣服，也没上床睡觉。","I told my man that I would undress and go to bed by myself, and I put out the candle.But I did not undress, and did not go to bed."
"我坐在椅子上，坐了好长一会儿，就像中了魔咒一样。我的感受是那样的新奇，那样的甜蜜……我静静地坐着，稍稍四处望望，一动不动，平静地呼吸，时不时地想起什么，就悄声笑笑，一想到我坠入了爱河，她就是我爱的人，这就是爱情，我不禁心头冷静下来。在黑暗中，齐娜依达的脸慢慢地浮现在我眼前——就那样浮着，没有消散；她的唇上还挂着那种神秘的微笑，她的眼睛望着我，目光微微斜着，似乎在发问，若有所思，带着温柔的神情……就像我们分别时那样。终于，我站了起来，踮着脚尖上了床，衣服也没脱，小心翼翼地把头靠在枕头上，就好像害怕鲁莽的动作会惊扰到充满我灵魂的那一切……我躺下来，但连眼睛都没合上。很快我发现，一种微弱的光线不断地射进屋子……我坐起身来，望向窗子。窗框和那神秘而朦胧地泛着光的窗玻璃清晰可辨。是暴风雨，我心想；确实是暴风雨，但只是在远处肆虐，根本听不到雷声；天空中只是不断地闪着模糊的、长长的、如同枝杈的闪电；与其说是闪动着，倒不如说更像是垂死的鸟儿的翅膀在颤抖着、抽搐着。我下了床，走到窗前，在那儿一直站到了天明……闪电一刻也没有停止过；农夫们把这样的夜晚称为雀夜。我凝视着寂静无声的沙地，凝视着涅斯库奇花园那边连片的黑暗，凝视着远处建筑正面发黄的外墙，它们似乎随着每次微弱的闪电也在颤动……我凝视着，无法转过头去；这些无声的闪电，这些微光，似乎和我内心中那无声的、秘密燃烧着的火焰相呼应。晨曦初露，大片的红光布满天空。太阳渐渐升起，闪电变得越来越黯淡，渐渐停止了；颤抖的电光也越来越短促，最终消失了，消失在这使万物苏醒的新一天的阳光中了……","I sat down on a chair, and sat a long while, as though spell-bound.What I was feeling was so new and so sweet....I sat still, hardly looking round and not moving, drew slow breaths, and only from time to time laughed silently at some recollection, or turned cold within at the thought that I was in love, that this was she, that this was love.Zinaïda’s face floated slowly before me in the darkness—floated, and did not float away; her lips still wore the same enigmatic smile, her eyes watched me, a little from one side, with a questioning, dreamy, tender look ... as at the instant of parting from her.At last I got up, walked on tiptoe to my bed, and without undressing, laid my head carefully on the pillow, as though I were afraid by an abrupt movement to disturb what filled my soul....I lay down, but did not even close my eyes.Soon I noticed that faint glimmers of light of some sort were thrown continually into the room....I sat up and looked at the window.The window-frame could be clearly distinguished from the mysteriously and dimly-lighted panes.It is a storm, I thought; and a storm it really was, but it was raging so very far away that the thunder could not be heard; only blurred, long, as it were branching, gleams of lightning flashed continually over the sky; it was not flashing, though, so much as quivering and twitching like the wing of a dying bird.I got up, went to the window, and stood there till morning....The lightning never ceased for an instant; it was what is called among the peasants a sparrow night.I gazed at the dumb sandy plain, at the dark mass of the Neskutchny gardens, at the yellowish façades of the distant buildings, which seemed to quiver too at each faint flash....I gazed, and could not turn away; these silent lightning flashes, these gleams seemed in response to the secret silent fires which were aglow within me.Morning began to dawn; the sky was flushed in patches of crimson.As the sun came nearer, the lightning grew gradually paler, and ceased; the quivering gleams were fewer and fewer, and vanished at last, drowned in the sobering positive light of the coming day...."
"我心中的闪电也消失了。我感到非常疲倦，但心绪很安宁……而齐娜依达的影子仍得意洋洋地在我心中飘荡。不过这个形象看起来也更安静了：就如同沼泽地的芦苇丛里飞出的天鹅一般，和四周不美好的事物分开，就在我要睡着的时候，我充满了爱慕的心情向它告别……","And my lightning flashes vanished too.I felt great weariness and peace ... but Zinaïda’s image still floated triumphant over my soul.But it too, this image, seemed more tranquil: like a swan rising out of the reeds of a bog, it stood out from the other unbeautiful figures surrounding it, and as I fell asleep, I flung myself before it in farewell, trusting adoration...."
"啊，那甜蜜的感情，那轻柔的和音，那温柔心灵的美好与宁静，那让人陶醉的初恋的幸福，它们在哪儿？在哪儿啊？","Oh, sweet emotions, gentle harmony, goodness and peace of the softened heart, melting bliss of the first raptures of love, where are they, where are they?"
"第八章","CHAPTER VIII"
"第二天清晨，我下楼喝茶的时候母亲责备了我——可比我预料的轻得多——她还要我告诉她昨天晚上都做了些什么。我简短地回答了几句，省略了很多细节，试图把一切都说得无可指责。","The next morning, when I came down to tea, my mother scolded me—less severely, however, than I had expected—and made me tell her how I had spent the previous evening.I answered her in few words, omitting many details, and trying to give the most innocent air to everything."
"“不管怎么说，他们都不是些遵守礼节的人，”母亲说，“你不必常去那儿闲逛，而是要准备考试，多用功。”","‘Anyway, they’re people who’re not comme il faut,’ my mother commented, ‘and you’ve no business to be hanging about there, instead of preparing yourself for the examination, and doing your work.’"
"我非常清楚母亲只是担心我的学业，要说的只有这些话，所以没必要多做回答；但是上午茶结束后，父亲挽着我的胳膊，和我一块去了花园，非要我讲在扎谢金家见到的一切。","As I was well aware that my mother’s anxiety about my studies was confined to these few words, I did not feel it necessary to make any rejoinder; but after morning tea was over, my father took me by the arm, and turning into the garden with me, forced me to tell him all I had seen at the Zasyekins’."
"父亲对我有着奇特的影响，而且我们之间的关系也很奇特。他对教育我几乎没有兴趣，但从来不伤害我的感情；他尊重我的自由，他待我——如果我可以这么形容的话——很客气……只是他从不让我跟他真正地亲近。我爱他，我钦佩他，我觉得他是完美的男人——天哪！如果不是经常感到他疏远着我，我将会多么热烈地爱他！但只要他愿意，哪怕只是一句话，或一个手势，他几乎就能马上唤起我对他的无限信任。我曾打开过心扉，就像对一个聪明的朋友或和蔼的老师一样谈话……可他突然甩开我，又将我拒之门外，虽然温柔亲切，却还是和我保持距离。","A curious influence my father had over me, and curious were the relations existing between us.He took hardly any interest in my education, but he never hurt my feelings; he respected my freedom, he treated me—if I may so express it—with courtesy,... only he never let me be really close to him.I loved him, I admired him, he was my ideal of a man—and Heavens!how passionately devoted I should have been to him, if I had not been continually conscious of his holding me off!But when he liked, he could almost instantaneously, by a single word, a single gesture, call forth an unbounded confidence in him.My soul expanded, I chattered away to him, as to a wise friend, a kindly teacher ... then he as suddenly got rid of me, and again he was keeping me off, gently and affectionately, but still he kept me off."
"有时候他有兴致，就会像个小孩一样和我跳啊蹦啊（他喜欢各种剧烈的运动）；只有一次——从没有发生过第二次！——他对我那么温柔，我几乎都要哭了……但是他的欢乐和温柔都消失得无影无踪；我们之间所发生的事不能让我对未来寄予任何希望——仿佛这一切只是我臆想出来的。有时候我只要仔细看着他那聪明、英俊、神采飞扬的脸庞……我的心就会怦怦地跳，我的整个身心都向往着他……他仿佛好像知道我内心中想着什么，会随意地轻拍一下我的脸颊，然后就走开了，或者他会做点什么事情，又或者突然变得冷若冰霜，那种冷若冰霜的态度是他特有的，而我立刻缩成一团，心也凉了下来。他对我鲜有的友好绝不是我无声的恳求所唤起的：他的友好总是突如其来地来临。之后细想父亲的性格，我得出这样一个结论：对我，对家庭生活，他都没心思；他的心放在其他事情上面了，而且自得其乐。“凡是能得到的就亲自去争取，不要受制于人；做自己——生活的滋味就在于此。”有一天他这样对我说。还有一次，作为一个年轻的民主主义者，我就自由发表自己的意见（在我看来，那天他是“友好的”，在这样的时刻我可以对他畅所欲言）。“自由，”他重复道，“你知道什么才能给一个人自由吗？”","Sometimes he was in high spirits, and then he was ready to romp and frolic with me, like a boy (he was fond of vigorous physical exercise of every sort); once—it never happened a second time!—he caressed me with such tenderness that I almost shed tears....But high spirits and tenderness alike vanished completely, and what had passed between us, gave me nothing to build on for the future—it was as though I had dreamed it all.Sometimes I would scrutinise his clever handsome bright face ... my heart would throb, and my whole being yearn to him ... he would seem to feel what was going on within me, would give me a passing pat on the cheek, and go away, or take up some work, or suddenly freeze all over as only he knew how to freeze, and I shrank into myself at once, and turned cold too.His rare fits of friendliness to me were never called forth by my silent, but intelligible entreaties: they always occurred unexpectedly.Thinking over my father’s character later, I have come to the conclusion that he had no thoughts to spare for me and for family life; his heart was in other things, and found complete satisfaction elsewhere.‘Take for yourself what you can, and don’t be ruled by others; to belong to oneself—the whole savour of life lies in that,’ he said to me one day.Another time, I, as a young democrat, fell to airing my views on liberty (he was ‘kind,’ as I used to call it, that day; and at such times I could talk to him as I liked).‘Liberty,’ he repeated; ‘and do you know what can give a man liberty?’"
"“什么？”","‘What?’"
"“意志，人自己的意志，它会赋予人比自由更大的权力。知道如何使用意志，你就是自由的，就会驾驭一切了。”","‘Will, his own will, and it gives power, which is better than liberty.Know how to will, and you will be free, and will lead.’"
"我的父亲首先也是最想要的，就是生活，他也生活过……也许他预感到他不会长久地享受生活的“滋味”：他42岁就去世了。","‘My father, before all, and above all, desired to live, and lived....Perhaps he had a presentiment that he would not have long to enjoy the ’savour’ of life: he died at forty-two."
"我向父亲描述那晚在扎谢金家度过的情形。他坐在花园椅子上，用手杖在沙子上划来划去，似乎很留心，又似乎漫不经心地听我讲着。他时不时地笑笑，显得开心，并饶有趣味地看看我，问些简短的问题或附和着怂恿我继续说下去。开始，我甚至都不敢提齐娜依达的名字，但是没忍多久便开始赞扬她了。父亲仍是笑笑；最后他显得若有所思，伸了一下懒腰，站起来了。我记得他走出屋子时，吩咐将他的马备好。他是个出色的骑手，早在莱里之前就有驯服最暴烈的马的决窍。","I described my evening at the Zasyekins’ minutely to my father.Half attentively, half carelessly, he listened to me, sitting on a garden seat, drawing in the sand with his cane.Now and then he laughed, shot bright, droll glances at me, and spurred me on with short questions and assents.At first I could not bring myself even to utter the name of Zinaïda, but I could not restrain myself long, and began singing her praises.My father still laughed; then he grew thoughtful, stretched, and got up.I remembered that as he came out of the house he had ordered his horse to be saddled.He was a splendid horseman, and, long before Rarey, had the secret of breaking in the most vicious horses."
"“我能和您一起去吗，父亲？”我问。","’Shall I come with you, father?’I asked."
"“不行，”他回答，他的脸上又恢复了那种常见的友好而漠不关心的神情。“如果你喜欢，就自己去吧；告诉马夫我不出去了。”","‘No,’ he answered, and his face resumed its ordinary expression of friendly indifference.‘Go alone, if you like; and tell the coachman I’m not going.’"
"他转过身去，匆匆地走开了。我目送他的背影消失在大门外。我看见他的帽子沿着栅栏移动着；他去扎谢金家了。","He turned his back on me and walked rapidly away.I looked after him; he disappeared through the gates.I saw his hat moving along beside the fence; he went into the Zasyekins’."
"他在那儿待了不到一个小时，接着就马上去城里了，直到晚上才回家。","He stayed there not more than an hour, but then departed at once for the town, and did not return home till evening."
"晚饭后，我自己去了扎谢金家。我发现只有老公爵夫人一个人在客厅。一看到我，她用编织针挠了挠帽子下的头，然后突然问我能不能给她抄写一份诉状。","After dinner I went myself to the Zasyekins’.In the drawing-room I found only the old princess.On seeing me she scratched her head under her cap with a knitting-needle, and suddenly asked me, could I copy a petition for her."
"“愿意效劳。”我答道，在椅子边上坐下来。","‘With pleasure,’ I replied, sitting down on the edge of a chair."
"“注意字写大点儿，”公爵夫人说道，递给我一张不整洁的纸，“今天就抄行吗，亲爱的少爷？”　　“当然可以了，我今天就抄。”","‘Only mind and make the letters bigger,’ observed the princess, handing me a dirty sheet of paper; ‘and couldn’t you do it today, my good sir?’‘Certainly, I will copy it today.’"
"隔壁房间的门刚好打开了，透过门缝，我看到了齐娜依达的脸庞苍白而忧郁，她的头发不经心地梳在后面；她那双冷冷的大眼睛瞥了我一眼，然后轻轻地把门关上了。","The door of the next room was just opened, and in the crack I saw the face of Zinaïda, pale and pensive, her hair flung carelessly back; she stared at me with big chilly eyes, and softly closed the door."
"“齐娜，齐娜！”老夫人喊着。齐娜依达没有回应。我把老夫人的诉状带回了家，抄了整整一个晚上。","‘Zina, Zina!’ called the old lady.Zinaïda made no response.I took home the old lady’s petition and spent the whole evening over it."
"第九章","CHAPTER IX"
"我的“激情”就是从那天开始的。回想起来，那时我的感觉和一个刚刚入伍的人的相似：我已经不再是一个小男孩了；我恋爱了。我说过，我的激情是从那天开始的；我应该再加一句，我的痛苦也是从那天开始的。齐娜依达不在身边时，我就苦闷不已；我无法思考，无法做事，我整天都强烈地思念着她……她不在身边我就苦闷，……但是她在身边的时候我也好不到哪儿去。我嫉妒，我自惭形愧，我要么傻里傻气地生闷气，要么傻里傻气地低三下四，然而同时，有一种无法抗拒的力量诱使我去爱她，每当我跨进她房间的门槛时，就禁不住因喜悦而颤抖。齐娜依达立刻就猜到我爱上她了，事实上我也从未想过隐瞒着。她拿我的感情寻开心，戏弄我，宠着我，又折磨我。成为别人最大的欢乐和最深的痛苦的唯一源泉以及能没有理由地使别人俯首听命，这是一种快乐。而我就像齐娜依达手里的一块软蜡。可事实上，我并不是唯一爱上她的人。到她家拜访的男人都为她神魂颠倒，拜倒在她脚下，任凭她摆布。齐娜依达唤起他们的希望，然后让他们恐惧，将他们玩弄于股掌之间（她曾称之为让他们撞撞头），以此取乐；而这些人从不想反抗，都乐意听命于她。在她那充满活力和美丽的身上，狡猾多端和无忧无虑、矫揉造作和纯朴自然、文静安详和调皮好动奇妙地交融在一起。她的一言一行，一举一动都显示着一种机敏、优雅的魅力，透露出她那独有的力量。她的面孔总是变化多端，表情也随之变化无常：她可以几乎同时流露出嘲笑、沉思和热忱的表情。各种各样的情感，犹如晴朗多风的日子里的云朵，一个接着一个微妙而又迅速地闪过她的嘴唇和双眼。","My ‘passion’ dated from that day.I felt at that time, I recollect, something like what a man must feel on entering the service: I had ceased now to be simply a young boy; I was in love.I have said that my passion dated from that day; I might have added that my sufferings too dated from the same day.Away from Zinaïda I pined; nothing was to my mind; everything went wrong with me; I spent whole days thinking intensely about her ... I pined when away,... but in her presence I was no better off.I was jealous; I was conscious of my insignificance; I was stupidly sulky or stupidly abject, and, all the same, an invincible force drew me to her, and I could not help a shudder of delight whenever I stepped through the doorway of her room.Zinaïda guessed at once that I was in love with her, and indeed I never even thought of concealing it.She amused herself with my passion, made a fool of me, petted and tormented me.There is a sweetness in being the sole source, the autocratic and irresponsible cause of the greatest joy and profoundest pain to another, and I was like wax in Zinaïda’s hands; though, indeed, I was not the only one in love with her.All the men who visited the house were crazy over her, and she kept them all in leading-strings at her feet.It amused her to arouse their hopes and then their fears, to turn them round her finger (she used to call it knocking their heads together), while they never dreamed of offering resistance and eagerly submitted to her.About her whole being, so full of life and beauty, there was a peculiarly bewitching mixture of slyness and carelessness, of artificiality and simplicity, of composure and frolicsomeness; about everything she did or said, about every action of hers, there clung a delicate, fine charm, in which an individual power was manifest at work.And her face was ever changing, working too; it expressed, almost at the same time, irony, dreaminess, and passion.Various emotions, delicate and quick-changing as the shadows of clouds on a sunny day of wind, chased one another continually over her lips and eyes."
"她的每个仰慕者对她来说都不可缺少。别洛夫佐罗夫，有时被她称为“我的野兽”，有时干脆称为“我的”，为了她，他能够赴汤蹈火。他对自己的智力和其他能力缺少信心，总是不断地向她求婚，并且暗示她，其他人只是围在她身边打转，没有真心实意。马依达诺夫与她天性中富有诗意的心弦共鸣；像大多数作家一样，他性情非常冷漠，他极力使她相信，或许也使他自己相信，他非常爱慕她，用没完没了的诗句歌颂她，并以一种既做作又真诚的独特热情为她朗诵诗句。她既同情他，又稍微地取笑他；她不怎么相信他，在听过他的倾诉之后，就叫他朗诵普希金的诗，据她说，这样能净化空气。卢申这个爱冷嘲热讽的医生，口头上玩世不恭，却比任何人都了解她，比所有人更爱她，尽管他曾经当着她的面或是背后责骂过她。她无法不尊重他，但要让他为此受点苦头，有时候她带着一种奇怪的、恶意的愉快劲让他觉得，他也在她的掌控之中。“我是个爱卖弄风情的女子，我没有良心，我天生就是个演员，”有一天她当着我的面对他说，“那好吧！那把您的手给我，我会把这根针扎进去，你在这个年轻人面前会觉得不好意思的，您会觉得痛的，但还是会笑的，诚实的先生。”卢申涨红了脸，转过头去，咬了咬嘴唇，最后还是伸出了手。她扎了下去，他的确开始大笑，……她也笑了，针扎的确实很深，她偷偷望着他那徒劳地看着别处的眼睛……","Each of her adorers was necessary to her.Byelovzorov, whom she sometimes called ’my wild beast,‘ and sometimes simply ’mine,’ would gladly have flung himself into the fire for her sake.With little confidence in his intellectual abilities and other qualities, he was for ever offering her marriage, hinting that the others were merely hanging about with no serious intention.Meidanov responded to the poetic fibres of her nature; a man of rather cold temperament, like almost all writers, he forced himself to convince her, and perhaps himself, that he adored her, sang her praises in endless verses, and read them to her with a peculiar enthusiasm, at once affected and sincere.She sympathised with him, and at the same time jeered at him a little; she had no great faith in him, and after listening to his outpourings, she would make him read Pushkin, as she said, to clear the air.Lushin, the ironical doctor, so cynical in words, knew her better than any of them, and loved her more than all, though he abused her to her face and behind her back.She could not help respecting him, but made him smart for it, and at times, with a peculiar, malignant pleasure, made him feel that he too was at her mercy.‘I’m a flirt, I’m heartless, I’m an actress in my instincts,’ she said to him one day in my presence; ‘well and good!Give me your hand then; I’ll stick this pin in it, you’ll be ashamed of this young man’s seeing it, it will hurt you, but you’ll laugh for all that, you truthful person.’Lushin crimsoned, turned away, bit his lips, but ended by submitting his hand.She pricked it, and he did in fact begin to laugh,... and she laughed, thrusting the pin in pretty deeply, and peeping into his eyes, which he vainly strove to keep in other directions...."
"我最不理解的就是齐娜依达和马列夫斯基伯爵之间的关系。他英俊聪明而且机敏，但是就连我这个16岁的孩子都能看出来，他身上有种模棱两可的、虚伪的东西，而且我很诧异齐娜依达竟然没有注意到这点。不过，也许她其实注意到了这种虚伪的东西，只是不觉得厌恶而已。不正规的教育，奇怪的交友和习惯，母亲经常相伴，家境的贫穷和居室的杂乱，这一切，从这个年轻女孩所享有的自由，意识到她优越于身边的人为起点，发展成一种类似鄙夷的漠不关心和不挑剔的性格。任何事都有可能随时发生；也许沃尼法提报告说没有糖了，或者某些让人厌恶的谣言传到她的耳朵里，又或者她的客人之间发生了争吵——她只会甩一甩卷发说：“这有什么关系！”满不在乎。","I understood least of all the relations existing between Zinaïda and Count Malevsky.He was handsome, clever, and adroit, but something equivocal, something false in him was apparent even to me, a boy of sixteen, and I marvelled that Zinaïda did not notice it.But possibly she did notice this element of falsity really and was not repelled by it.Her irregular education, strange acquaintances and habits, the constant presence of her mother, the poverty and disorder in their house, everything, from the very liberty the young girl enjoyed, with the consciousness of her superiority to the people around her, had developed in her a sort of half-contemptuous carelessness and lack of fastidiousness.At any time anything might happen; Vonifaty might announce that there was no sugar, or some revolting scandal would come to her ears, or her guests would fall to quarrelling among themselves—she would only shake her curls, and say, ‘What does it matter?’ and care little enough about it."
"每当马列夫斯基像狡猾的狐狸一样靠近她，优雅地靠在她的椅背上，开始带着一种自我满足和逢迎讨好的微笑对她轻声耳语时，她就把手臂交叉叠在胸前，聚精会神地望着他，面露笑意，不住地摇头，而这时我全身的血液就像燃烧了一样，愤懑不已。","But my blood, anyway, was sometimes on fire with indignation when Malevsky approached her, with a sly, fox-like action, leaned gracefully on the back of her chair, and began whispering in her ear with a self-satisfied and ingratiating little smile, while she folded her arms across her bosom, looked intently at him and smiled too, and shook her head."
"“是什么让您接受马列夫斯基伯爵呢？”有一天我问她。","‘What induces you to receive Count Malevsky?’I asked her one day."
"“他有那么漂亮的小胡子，”她回答，“可您是不会明白的。”","‘He has such pretty moustaches,’ she answered.‘But that’s rather beyond you.’"
"“您不必认为我喜欢他，”有一次她对我说，“不会的；我不会喜欢我看不上的人。我一定要找一个能征服我的人……但是，仁慈的上天啊，希望我永远也不会遇到那样的人！我可不想被别人捏在手心里，千万不要。”","‘You needn’t think I care for him,’ she said to me another time.‘No; I can’t care for people I have to look down upon.I must have some one who can master me....But, merciful heavens, I hope I may never come across any one like that!I don’t want to be caught in any one’s claws, not for anything.’"
"“那么，您就永远不恋爱了吗？”","‘You’ll never be in love, then?’"
"“可您呢？我不爱您吗？”她说道，用手套的指尖弹了一下我的鼻子。","‘And you?Don’t I love you?’ she said, and she flicked me on the nose with the tip of her glove."
"是呀，齐娜依达总是拿我寻开心。三周来，我每天都去见她，没有什么把戏她没对我玩过！她几乎不怎么来我家，对此我一点儿也不觉得遗憾，在我家的时候她就变成一个年轻小姐了，公爵小姐，我都有点被她威慑住了。我害怕在母亲面前露出什么马脚；她非常不喜欢齐娜依达，总是怀着敌意看着我们。我倒不那么害怕父亲：他好像没有注意到我。他很少和她谈话，但一谈就显得特别睿智，而且意味深长。我不再学习和读书了，我甚至都不去邻近的地方散步和骑马了。就像被栓住了腿的甲虫，我不停地在我所喜爱的小厢房周围转来转去。我真愿意永远留在那儿……但似乎那是不可能的。母亲常常责骂我，有时齐娜依达也赶我走。那时我就把自己关在房间里，或者走到花园的尽头去，爬上一座废弃的高高的石砌暖房上，一坐就是好几个小时，两条腿耷拉在临街的墙上，望着，望着，可什么也看不见。在我身边，几只白蝴蝶在落满灰尘的荨麻上懒洋洋地飞过；一只俏皮的麻雀停在不远处有些破败的红砖墙上，烦躁地唧唧喳喳叫着，还不停地扭动身体，整理尾巴上的羽毛；那些仍然不信任我的乌鸦高高地栖息在一棵桦树顶端光秃秃的树枝上，不时地呱呱叫几声；阳光和微风轻轻地在柔软的枝条间嬉戏掠过；耳边时不时地飘来顿河岸修道院里叮当的钟声，平静而又凄凉，我坐着，望着，听着，全身充满一种难以名状的感触，其中蕴含了一切：悲伤、欢乐、对未来的预感和对生活的渴望与恐惧。可那时我对此一点儿也不理解，也不能把我心中随意出现的各种思绪说出个名目来，或者我可以用一个名字来称呼这一切——齐娜依达。","Yes, Zinaïda amused herself hugely at my expense.For three weeks I saw her every day, and what didn’t she do with me!She rarely came to see us, and I was not sorry for it; in our house she was transformed into a young lady, a young princess, and I was a little overawed by her.I was afraid of betraying myself before my mother; she had taken a great dislike to Zinaïda, and kept a hostile eye upon us.My father I was not so much afraid of; he seemed not to notice me.He talked little to her, but always with special cleverness and significance.I gave up working and reading; I even gave up walking about the neighbourhood and riding my horse.Like a beetle tied by the leg, I moved continually round and round my beloved little lodge.I would gladly have stopped there altogether, it seemed ... but that was impossible.My mother scolded me, and sometimes Zinaïda herself drove me away.Then I used to shut myself up in my room, or go down to the very end of the garden, and climbing into what was left of a tall stone greenhouse, now in ruins, sit for hours with my legs hanging over the wall that looked on to the road, gazing and gazing and seeing nothing.White butterflies flitted lazily by me, over the dusty nettles; a saucy sparrow settled not far off on the half crumbling red brickwork and twittered irritably, incessantly twisting and turning and preening his tail-feathers; the still mistrustful rooks cawed now and then, sitting high, high up on the bare top of a birch-tree; the sun and wind played softly on its pliant branches; the tinkle of the bells of the Don monastery floated across to me from time to time, peaceful and dreary; while I sat, gazed, listened, and was filled full of a nameless sensation in which all was contained: sadness and joy and the foretaste of the future, and the desire and dread of life.But at that time I understood nothing of it, and could have given a name to nothing of all that was passing at random within me, or should have called it all by one name—the name of Zinaïda."
"齐娜依达继续和我玩猫捉老鼠的把戏。她向我卖弄风情我，我就变得激动不已，欣喜若狂；她又会突然把我推开，我却不敢走近她，都不敢看她一眼。","Zinaïda continued to play cat and mouse with me.She flirted with me, and I was all agitation and rapture; then she would suddenly thrust me away, and I dared not go near her—dared not look at her."
"我记得她接连几天都对我非常冷淡；我彻底沮丧了，胆怯地蹑手蹑脚去她们的小屋，尽可能待在老公爵夫人的身边，不管那时老夫人正在破口大骂，抱怨着什么；她的财务官司进行得很不顺利，她已经向警官“解释”过两次了。","I remember she was very cold to me for several days together; I was completely crushed, and creeping timidly to their lodge, tried to keep close to the old princess, regardless of the circumstance that she was particularly scolding and grumbling just at that time; her financial affairs had been going badly, and she had already had two ‘explanations’ with the police officials."
"一天，我正在花园里熟悉的栅栏边散步时看到了齐娜依达；她撑着双臂坐在草地上，一动不动。正当我想悄悄溜走时，她突然抬起了头，专横地召唤我过去。我的心便不听使唤了；开始我还不明白她的意思。她又做了个召我过去的手势。我立刻跳过栅栏，兴冲冲地跑向她，可她向我使了个眼神让我停下来，示意我呆在离她有两步远的一条小径上。我心慌意乱，不知如何是好，就在小径的边上跪下了。她面色是那么的苍白，脸上的每个部分都显得那么的痛苦和疲惫不堪，这让我一阵心痛，不由得喃喃地问：“怎么了？”","One day I was walking in the garden beside the familiar fence, and I caught sight of Zinaïda; leaning on both arms, she was sitting on the grass, not stirring a muscle.I was about to make off cautiously, but she suddenly raised her head and beckoned me imperiously.My heart failed me; I did not understand her at first.She repeated her signal.I promptly jumped over the fence and ran joyfully up to her, but she brought me to a halt with a look, and motioned me to the path two paces from her.In confusion, not knowing what to do, I fell on my knees at the edge of the path.She was so pale, such bitter suffering, such intense weariness, was expressed in every feature of her face, that it sent a pang to my heart, and I muttered unconsciously, ‘What is the matter?’"
"齐娜依达伸出手，抓了一根草，咬了一下，又远远地扔掉了。","Zinaïda stretched out her head, picked a blade of grass, bit it and flung it away from her."
"“您非常爱我吗？”她终于问道，“是吗？”","‘You love me very much?’ she asked at last.‘Yes.’"
"我没有回答——的确是，这何需回答呢？","I made no answer—indeed, what need was there to answer?"
"“是吗？”她又问了一遍，仍像刚才那样看着我。“就是那样。一样的眼睛。”——她继续说道，接着陷入了沉思，用双手捂住了脸。“一切都变得让我厌烦，”她低声说，“我真想走到天涯海角去——我再也受不了了，我应付不了……可我又有什么前途呢！……唉，我真痛苦……我的天啊，太痛苦了！”","‘Yes,’ she repeated, looking at me as before.‘That’s so.The same eyes,’—she went on; sank into thought, and hid her face in her hands.‘Everything’s grown so loathsome to me,’ she whispered, ‘I would have gone to the other end of the world first—I can’t bear it, I can’t get over it.... And what is there before me!...Ah, I am wretched....My God, how wretched I am!’"
"“为什么啊？”我怯生生地问道。","‘What for?’I asked timidly."
"齐娜依达没有回答，只是耸了耸肩。我仍跪在那儿，极度忧伤地望着她。她说的每句话对我都如同刀割一样。此刻我觉得，只要她不再悲伤，我宁愿献出自己的生命。我注视着她——虽然我不明白她为什么痛苦，但我能真切地想象得到：她感到一阵难以抑制的苦闷，就突然来到花园里，就像被镰刀割倒似地倒在了地上。四周阳光明媚、郁郁葱葱，清风在树叶间低语，时不时地摇曳着齐娜依达头顶上的那木莓的长长的枝条。身边有鸽子咕咕的叫声，蜜蜂嗡嗡地在稀疏的草地上低飞，头顶上天空湛蓝——可我却如此的忧伤……","Zinaïda made no answer, she simply shrugged her shoulders.I remained kneeling, gazing at her with intense sadness.Every word she had uttered simply cut me to the heart.At that instant I felt I would gladly have given my life, if only she should not grieve.I gazed at her—and though I could not understand why she was wretched, I vividly pictured to myself, how in a fit of insupportable anguish, she had suddenly come out into the garden, and sunk to the earth, as though mown down by a scythe.It was all bright and green about her; the wind was whispering in the leaves of the trees, and swinging now and then a long branch of a raspberry bush over Zinaïda’s head.There was a sound of the cooing of doves, and the bees hummed, flying low over the scanty grass, Overhead the sun was radiantly blue—while I was so sorrowful...."
"“为我读些诗吧，”齐娜依达低声说着，用胳膊肘支撑住身体，“我喜欢您读的诗歌。您读诗就像唱歌，不过没有关系，因为您还年轻。请给我读《在格鲁吉亚的山岗上》不过您请先坐下。”","‘Read me some poetry,’ said Zinaïda in an undertone, and she propped herself on her elbow; ‘I like your reading poetry.You read it in sing-song, but that’s no matter, that comes of being young.Read me On the Hills of Georgia.Only sit down first.’"
"我坐了下来并朗诵了《在格鲁吉亚的山岗上》。","I sat down and read ‘On the Hills of Georgia.’"
"“那颗心别无选择只有去爱，”齐娜依达重复道，“这首诗的美妙之处就在于此；它告诉我们不存在的事物，它不仅比存在的事物更美，而且更接近真实，别无选择只有去爱，——那颗心也许不想去爱，但却不能自己。”她又沉默了，然后突然动了下，站了起来。“咱们走吧。马伊达诺夫和妈妈在屋里呢，他给我带来了他的一首诗，可我却把他丢下不管。现在他一定很伤心……我也没有办法！某一天你总会明白这一切的……只是不要生我的气！”","‘ That the heart cannot choose but love, ’ repeated Zinaïda.‘That’s where poetry’s so fine; it tells us what is not, and what’s not only better than what is, but much more like the truth, cannot choose but love, —it might want not to, but it can’t help it.’She was silent again, then all at once she started and got up.‘Come along.Meidanov’s indoors with mamma, he brought me his poem, but I deserted him.His feelings are hurt too now ... I can’t help it!you’ll understand it all some day ... only don’t be angry with me!’"
"齐娜依达匆忙地拉着我的手，向前面跑去。我们回到了厢房。马伊达诺夫开始为我们朗诵他刚出版的诗《凶手》，可我没有听进去。他拖长音调大声朗诵着他那四韵脚的抑扬格诗句，更迭的韵律就像小铃铛一样叮当作响，嘈杂而又毫无意义，而我始终望着齐娜依达，竭力想弄明白她最后几句话的含义。","Zinaïda hurriedly pressed my hand and ran on ahead.We went back into the lodge.Meidanov set to reading us his ‘Manslayer,’ which had just appeared in print, but I did not hear him.He screamed and drawled his four-foot iambic lines, the alternating rhythms jingled like little bells, noisy and meaningless, while I still watched Zinaïda and tried to take in the import of her last words."
"“或许有个神秘的情敌","’Perchance some unknown rival"
"让人意想不到地征服了你？”","Has surprised and mastered thee?’"
"马伊达诺夫忽然用鼻音高声朗诵——我的目光和齐娜依达的目光不期而遇。她垂下目光，脸颊微红。我看到她脸红了，惊得浑身发冷。我之前就心生妒忌了，但只是在那一刻，我脑中才闪过她已经爱上某人的念头。“天啊！她恋爱了！”","Meidanov bawled suddenly through his nose—and my eyes and Zinaïda’s met.She looked down and faintly blushed.I saw her blush, and grew cold with terror.I had been jealous before, but only at that instant the idea of her being in love flashed upon my mind.‘Good God!she is in love!’"
"第十章","CHAPTER X"
"从那一刻起，我真正的煎熬开始了。我绞尽脑汁，左思右想，反复思量，坚持不懈地尽可能暗中观察齐娜依达。她变了，这很容易看出来。她开始一个人去散步——一走就是很长时间。有时她不愿见客，在自己的房间一坐就好几个小时。以往她从没有这样的习惯。突然间我变得——或许我以为自己变得——很有观察力了。","My real torments began from that instant.I racked my brains, changed my mind, and changed it back again, and kept an unremitting, though, as far as possible, secret watch on Zinaïda.A change had come over her, that was obvious.She began going walks alone—and long walks.Sometimes she would not see visitors; she would sit for hours together in her room.This had never been a habit of hers till now.I suddenly became—or fancied I had become—extraordinarily penetrating."
"“莫非是他？或者是他？”我常常自问，焦虑不安地从她的一个爱慕者猜到另一个爱慕者。我暗暗发现马列夫斯基伯爵比别人更危险，但因为齐娜依达的缘故，我羞于向自己承认这点。","‘Isn’t it he?or isn’t it he?’I asked myself, passing in inward agitation from one of her admirers to another.Count Malevsky secretly struck me as more to be feared than the others, though, for Zinaïda’s sake, I was ashamed to confess it to myself."
"我的观察力也就鼻尖儿那么远，我的秘密可能也没瞒过任何人；至少，卢申医生很快就看透我了。但是近来他也变了；他变瘦了，虽然还经常大笑，但他的笑声听起来更沉闷、更恶毒、更短促了；他从前轻松的嘲讽和假装的愤世嫉俗不见了，取而代之的是不能自主而神经质地发急发怒。","My watchfulness did not see beyond the end of my nose, and its secrecy probably deceived no one; any way, Doctor Lushin soon saw through me.But he, too, had changed of late; he had grown thin, he laughed as often, but his laugh seemed more hollow, more spiteful, shorter, an involuntary nervous irritability took the place of his former light irony and assumed cynicism."
"“您怎么老是待在这儿呢，年轻人？”有一天，只剩下我们俩人待在扎谢金家的客厅里时他对我说，（公爵小姐外出散步还没回家，屋子里能听到老公爵夫人叫嚷的声音，她正在训斥女仆。）“您本来应该学习，用功读书——趁着您年轻——可您都在做什么啊？”","‘Why are you incessantly hanging about here, young man?’ he said to me one day, when we were left alone together in the Zasyekins‘ drawing-room.(The young princess had not come home from a walk, and the shrill voice of the old princess could be heard within; she was scolding the maid.)‘You ought to be studying, working—while you’re young—and what are you doing?’"
"“您又不可能知道我在家用不用功。”我带着傲慢的语气反驳着，但神情还是有些慌乱。","‘You can’t tell whether I work at home,’ I retorted with some haughtiness, but also with some hesitation."
"“您倒是用了不少功！您想的可不是这些事！好吧，我不想说您的不是……在您这样的年纪，这是很正常的事。可您的选择真是不走运。难道您看不明白这是个什么样的人家吗？”","‘A great deal of work you do!that’s not what you’re thinking about!Well, I won’t find fault with that ... at your age that’s in the natural order of things.But you’ve been awfully unlucky in your choice.Don’t you see what this house is?’"
"“我不明白您的意思。”我答道。","‘I don’t understand you,’ I observed."
"“您不明白吗？那更糟糕了。我觉得我有义务提醒您。像我这样的老单身汉可以到这儿来，这对我们能有什么伤害！我们都久经锻炼，什么也伤害不了我们；但是您的皮肉还嫩——这儿的气氛对您不好——相信我，您会受到伤害的。”","‘You don’t understand?so much the worse for you.I regard it as a duty to warn you.Old bachelors, like me, can come here, what harm can it do us!we’re tough, nothing can hurt us, what harm can it do us; but your skin’s tender yet—this air is bad for you—believe me, you may get harm from it.’"
"“怎么会呢？”","‘How so?’"
"“怎么会呢，您现在觉得好吗？您现在处在正常的状态中吗？您现在感觉到的——对您有益吗——对您有好处吗？”","‘Why, are you well now?Are you in a normal condition?Is what you’re feeling—beneficial to you—good for you?’"
"“怎么，我感觉到什么了？”我说着，可在心里明白这位医生是对的。","‘Why, what am I feeling?’I said, while in my heart I knew the doctor was right."
"“呵，年轻人啊，年轻人，”医生继续说道，带着那样一种语气，似乎那两句话里包含了对我极大的侮辱，“您这样躲躲闪闪的有什么用呢？谢天谢地，说到现在您心里想的，全在您脸上呢。可是，说出来有什么用呢？如果……（医生咬着牙关）……如果我不是这样的怪人，我自己就本不该上这儿来的。只有一点让我纳闷儿；您这样的聪明人，怎么会看不清您身边发生的这些事呢？”","‘Ah, young man, young man,’ the doctor went on with an intonation that suggested that something highly insulting to me was contained in these two words, ‘what’s the use of your prevaricating, when, thank God, what’s in your heart is in your face, so far?But there, what’s the use of talking?I shouldn’t come here myself, if ... (the doctor compressed his lips) ... if I weren’t such a queer fellow.Only this is what surprises me; how it is, you, with your intelligence, don’t see what is going on around you?’"
"“发生什么事了？”我插嘴问道，警觉起来。","‘And what is going on?’I put in, all on the alert."
"医生带着一副嘲笑而又惋惜的目光看着我。","The doctor looked at me with a sort of ironical compassion."
"“我真是个好人！”他似乎自言自语，“他似乎有必要知道这些。事实上，我再对您说一遍吧，”他提高声音补充道，“这儿的气氛不适合您。您愿意待在这儿，但这里又怎么样呢？温室虽然美好，让人感到惬意，芳香扑鼻——但是这里不适合人居住。听我的吧，回去读卡伊达诺夫的课本吧。“","‘Nice of me!’ he said as though to himself, ‘as if he need know anything of it.In fact, I tell you again,’ he added, raising his voice, ‘the atmosphere here is not fit for you.You like being here, but what of that!it’s nice and sweet-smelling in a greenhouse—but there’s no living in it.Yes! do as I tell you, and go back to your Keidanov.’"
"老公爵夫人走进来了，开始向医生抱怨她的牙痛。接着齐娜依达也回来了。","The old princess came in, and began complaining to the doctor of her toothache.Then Zinaïda appeared."
"“看，”老公爵夫人说道，”医生，您得说说她。她整天都喝冷冰冰的水，那样对她好吗？天呀，她身体本来就弱。”","‘Come,’ said the old princess, ‘you must scold her, doctor.She’s drinking iced water all day long; is that good for her, pray, with her delicate chest?’"
"“您为什么要那样做呢？”卢申问道。","‘Why do you do that?’ asked Lushin."
"“那能有什么事吗？”","‘Why, what effect could it have?’"
"“有什么事？您可能会得风寒，还会丢了命。”","‘What effect?You might get a chill and die.’"
"“真的吗？您说真的吗？很好——那样就更好了。”","‘Truly?Do you mean it?Very well—so much the better.’"
"“好主意！”医生嘀咕了一句。老公爵夫人出去了。","‘A fine idea!’ muttered the doctor.The old princess had gone out."
"“是呀，好主意。”齐娜依达又重复了一遍。“生活是就那么开心吗？就看看您吧……很好吗，嗯？难道您觉得我还不明白吗，还没感觉到吗？喝冷冰冰的水让我感到痛快；您能一本正经地要我相信这样的生活太珍贵，不值得为了一时的痛快冒险——可我已经没有幸福可谈了。”","‘Yes, a fine idea,’ repeated Zinaïda.‘Is life such a festive affair?Just look about you....Is it nice, eh?Or do you imagine I don’t understand it, and don’t feel it?It gives me pleasure—drinking iced water; and can you seriously assure me that such a life is worth too much to be risked for an instant’s pleasure—happiness I won’t even talk about.’"
"“哦，说得好，”卢申说道，“任性妄为和不负责任……这两个词是对您的总结；您的整个性格都在这两个词里。”","‘Oh, very well,’ remarked Lushin, ‘caprice and irresponsibility....Those two words sum you up; your whole nature’s contained in those two words.’"
"齐娜依达不安地笑了笑。","Zinaïda laughed nervously."
"“您的看法过时了，亲爱的医生。您的观察可不够仔细；您落后了。戴上您的眼镜吧。我现在可不任性了。捉弄你们，捉弄我自己……这里可有好多乐子！——至于不负责任……沃尔德玛先生，”齐娜依达跺了下脚，突然说道，“别哭丧着脸。我可受不了别人同情我。”她立即离开了屋子。","‘You’re late for the post, my dear doctor.You don’t keep a good look-out; you’re behind the times.Put on your spectacles.I’m in no capricious humour now.To make fools of you, to make a fool of myself ... much fun there is in that!—and as for irresponsibility ... M’sieu Voldemar,’ Zinaïda added suddenly, stamping, ’don’t make such a melancholy face.I can’t endure people to pity me.’She went quickly out of the room."
"“年轻人，这儿的气氛对您不好，非常不好。”卢申又对我说了一遍。","‘It’s bad for you, very bad for you, this atmosphere, young man,’ Lushin said to me once more."
"第十一章","CHAPTER XI"
"当天傍晚，常客们都在扎谢金家里聚到一起。我也在其中。","On the evening of the same day the usual guests were assembled at the Zasyekins’.I was among them."
"话题谈到了马伊达诺夫的诗歌上。齐娜依达对他的诗作表达了真心的称赞。“但是，您知道吗？”她对他说，“如果我是个诗人，我就会选个截然不同的题材。也许这些都是胡说，但是我脑子里有时就会冒出奇怪的念头，特别是清晨我睡不着的时候，那个时候天空同时呈现出玫瑰色和灰白色。我就会，比方说…… 你们不会笑话我吧？”","The conversation turned on Meidanov’s poem.Zinaïda expressed genuine admiration of it.‘But do you know what?’ she said to him.‘If I were a poet, I would choose quite different subjects.Perhaps it’s all nonsense, but strange ideas sometimes come into my head, especially when I’m not asleep in the early morning, when the sky begins to turn rosy and grey both at once.I would, for instance ... You won’t laugh at me?’"
"“不，不会的！”我们异口同声地叫道。","‘No, no!’ we all cried, with one voice."
"“我就会描写，”她继续说着，胳膊交叉在胸前，目光落在一旁，“一大群姑娘在夜里乘坐一艘大船，在一条静静的河上行驶。月光皎洁，她们全都身穿雪白的衣裙，头戴白色的花冠，唱着歌，您明白吗，吟着颂歌一类的诗歌。”","‘I would describe,’ she went on, folding her arms across her bosom and looking away, ‘a whole company of young girls at night in a great boat, on a silent river.The moon is shining, and they are all in white, and wearing garlands of white flowers, and singing, you know, something in the nature of a hymn.’"
"““我明白——我明白；继续说。”马伊达诺夫带着幻想的意味说道。","‘I see—I see; go on,’ Meidanov commented with dreamy significance."
"“突然，岸边传来大声的喧闹声、欢笑声和手鼓声，还出现了火把…… 一群酒神的女祭司们在跳舞，她们唱着歌、喊叫着。描绘这些是您的差事，诗人先生；…… 我只希望火把是红色的，要升起大片浓烟，酒神的女祭司的眼睛在花冠下闪烁，花冠要暗色的。还有，别忘了虎皮，高脚杯和金子——很多的金子……”","‘All of a sudden, loud clamour, laughter, torches, tambourines on the bank....It’s a troop of Bacchantes dancing with songs and cries.It’s your business to make a picture of it, Mr. Poet;... only I should like the torches to be red and to smoke a great deal, and the Bacchantes’ eyes to gleam under their wreaths, and the wreaths to be dusky.Don’t forget the tiger-skins, too, and goblets and gold—lots of gold....’"
"“金子应该放在哪儿呢？”马伊达诺夫问道，同时把顺滑的头发甩到脑后，还张了张鼻孔。","‘Where ought the gold to be?’ asked Meidanov, tossing back his sleek hair and distending his nostrils."
"“放在哪儿？放在她们的肩上、手臂上、还有腿上——哪儿都放。据说，古时候女人们的脚踝上都戴着金链子。女祭司们召唤船上的姑娘们过去。姑娘们不再唱颂歌了——她们不能再唱下去了，但是她们都没有动；河水把她们送到了岸边。突然她们中的一个姑娘慢慢地站了起来…… 这里您要好好地描写：她在月光下是怎样缓慢地站起来的，还有她的女伴们是如何地恐慌…… 她跨过了船舷，女祭司们把她团团围住，迅速把她掳到夜色和黑暗中去了…… 这里要描写团团烟雾，到处都一片混乱。只能听到她们刺耳的尖叫声，那姑娘的花冠还留在岸边。”","‘Where?on their shoulders and arms and legs—everywhere.They say in ancient times women wore gold rings on their ankles.The Bacchantes call the girls in the boat to them.The girls have ceased singing their hymn—they cannot go on with it, but they do not stir, the river carries them to the bank.And suddenly one of them slowly rises....This you must describe nicely: how she slowly gets up in the moonlight, and how her companions are afraid....She steps over the edge of the boat, the Bacchantes surround her, whirl her away into night and darkness....Here put in smoke in clouds and everything in confusion.There is nothing but the sound of their shrill cry, and her wreath left lying on the bank.’"
"齐娜依达不说了。（“啊！她恋爱了！”我又暗自想着。）","Zinaïda ceased.(‘Oh! she is in love!’ I thought again.)"
"“就这些吗？”马伊达诺夫问。","‘And is that all?’ asked Meidanov."
"“就这些。”","‘That’s all.’"
"“这不能成为整首诗的主题，”他自命不凡地说道，“不过我可以用您的构思创作一首抒情短诗。”","‘That can’t be the subject of a whole poem,’ he observed pompously, ‘but I will make use of your idea for a lyrical fragment.’"
"“是浪漫主义风格的吗？”马列夫斯基问道。","‘In the romantic style?’ queried Malevsky."
"“当然了，用浪漫主义风格——拜伦式的。”","‘Of course, in the romantic style—Byronic.’"
"“嗯，在我看来，雨果比拜伦强，”年轻的伯爵满不在乎地随口说道，“他写得更有趣。”","‘Well, to my mind, Hugo beats Byron,’ the young count observed negligently; ‘he’s more interesting.’"
"“雨果是个一流的作家。”马伊达诺夫答道，“可是我的朋友东柯什耶夫，在他的西班牙长篇小说《埃尔特罗瓦多尔》里……”","‘Hugo is a writer of the first class,’ replied Meidanov; ‘and my friend, Tonkosheev, in his Spanish romance, El Trovador ...’"
"“啊！是那本问号都是颠倒着写的书吗？”齐娜依达插了一句。","‘Ah!is that the book with the question-marks turned upside down?’Zinaïda interrupted."
"“是的。那是西班牙人的习惯。我正想说东柯什耶夫……”","‘Yes.That’s the custom with the Spanish.I was about to observe that Tonkosheev ...’"
"“又来了！你们又要争论起古典主义和浪漫主义了。”齐娜依达又插嘴道，“我们不如来玩……” ","‘Come!you’re going to argue about classicism and romanticism again,’ Zinaïda interrupted him a second time.’ We’d much better play ..."
"“罚物游戏？”卢申接过话头。","‘Forfeits?’ put in Lushin."
"“不啦，罚物游戏没意思；我们来玩比喻吧。”（齐娜依达自己发明的游戏；先说一样东西，每个人想方设法用另一样东西与之相对比，比喻得最恰当的人得奖。）","‘No, forfeits are a bore; at comparisons.’ (This game Zinaïda had invented herself.Some object was mentioned, every one tried to compare it with something, and the one who chose the best comparison got a prize.)"
"她走到窗前去。太阳刚刚落下，天空中高高地飘浮着大片绯红的云朵。","She went up to the window.The sun was just setting; high up in the sky were large red clouds."
"“你们看那些云彩像什么？”齐娜依达问道，还没等我们回答，她就说道，“我觉得它们像克利奥帕特拉去迎接安东尼时金色船只上的紫色桅帆。您还记得吗？马伊达诺夫，不久前您告诉我的。”","‘What are those clouds like?’ questioned Zinaïda; and without waiting for our answer, she said, ‘I think they are like the purple sails on the golden ship of Cleopatra, when she sailed to meet Antony.Do you remember, Meidanov, you were telling me about it not long ago?’"
"我们像《哈姆雷特》中的波洛涅斯，都表示没有什么能比那些桅帆更贴切了，还认为我们谁也找不出比这更好的比喻了。","All of us, like Polonius in Hamlet, opined that the clouds recalled nothing so much as those sails, and that not one of us could discover a better comparison."
"“那时安东尼有多大年纪？”齐娜依达问道。","‘And how old was Antony then?’ inquired Zinaïda."
"“毫无疑问是个年轻人。”马列夫斯基答道。","‘A young man, no doubt,’ observed Malevsky."
"“是的，是个年轻人。”马伊达诺夫肯定地证实。","‘Yes, a young man,’ Meidanov chimed in in confirmation."
"“对不起，”卢申叫道，“他已经四十出头了。”","‘Excuse me,’ cried Lushin, ‘he was over forty.’"
"“四十出头了。”齐娜依达迅速地瞥了他一眼，重复地说着…… ","‘Over forty,’ repeated Zinaïda, giving him a rapid glance...."
"不久我就回家了。“她恋爱了。”我毫无意识地重复着……“可是和谁呢？”","I soon went home.’She is in love,‘ my lips unconsciously repeated.... ’But with whom?’"
"第十二章","CHAPTER XII"
"日子一天天过去了。齐娜依达变得越来越古怪，越来越难以理解。一天我去找她，看见她正坐在柳条椅上，头紧紧地顶住桌子的尖角。她坐直了身子…… 满脸都是泪水。","The days passed by.Zinaïda became stranger and stranger, and more and more incomprehensible.One day I went over to her, and saw her sitting in a basket-chair, her head pressed to the sharp edge of the table.She drew herself up ... her whole face was wet with tears."
"“啊，您呀！”她脸上挂着冷酷的微笑，说道，“请过来。”","‘Ah, you!’ she said with a cruel smile.‘Come here.’"
"我走到她面前。她把手放在我的头上，突然她抓住了我的头发，开始扯了起来。","I went up to her.She put her hand on my head, and suddenly catching hold of my hair, began pulling it."
"“弄疼我了。”我终于叫道。","‘It hurts me,’ I said at last."
"“哈！是吗？难道您觉得我就不会疼吗？”她回答道。","‘Ah!does it?And do you suppose nothing hurts me?’ she replied."
"“啊！”她看到已经撕扯下我的一小缕头发，突然尖叫道，“我都做了些什么啊？可怜的沃尔德玛先生！”","‘Ai!’ she cried suddenly, seeing she had pulled a little tuft of hair out.‘What have I done?Poor M’sieu Voldemar!’"
"她小心翼翼地捋平扯下的头发，在手指上打了个圈，缠成个戒指形。","She carefully smoothed the hair she had torn out, stroked it round her finger, and twisted it into a ring."
"“我会把您的头发放在链坠里，挂在脖子上。”她说着，可是眼里还闪着泪水。“这对您来说会是个小小的安慰，或许…… 可是现在再见吧。”","‘I shall put your hair in a locket and wear it round my neck,’ she said, while the tears still glittered in her eyes.‘That will be some small consolation to you, perhaps ... and now good-bye.’"
"我回到家，正碰上家里很不愉快的场面。母亲正和父亲吵架；她正因为什么事情责备他，可是他就像往常一样，保持一种礼貌的冷冰冰的沉默，不久就离开了。我听不到母亲在说什么，事实上，我也没有多余心思听；我只记得争吵结束后，她召我去她的房间，她对我经常拜访公爵夫人表示了极大的不满，用她的话说，公爵夫人是个什么事都做得出来的女人。我吻了一下她的手（当我想结束谈话的时候，我经常这样做）就回到自己的房间去了。齐娜依达的眼泪让我完全不知所措；我简直不知道该想些什么，只想自己哭一场；尽管我16岁了，可我毕竟还是个孩子。现在我已经不再关注马列夫斯基了，尽管别洛夫佐罗夫一天比一天更阴险可怕了，他就像狼盯着羊似的盯着狡猾的伯爵；但我没想任何事，也没想任何人。我已经无法思考了，总是寻找一个僻静的地方独自待着。我特别喜欢那个废弃的暖房。我常爬到高高的墙上坐下，像个不幸的、孤独的、忧郁的少年那样坐着，可怜起自己来了——结果这些悲伤的情绪给了我无限欣慰，让我沉醉其中了！…… ","I went home, and found an unpleasant state of things there.My mother was having a scene with my father; she was reproaching him with something, while he, as his habit was, maintained a polite and chilly silence, and soon left her.I could not hear what my mother was talking of, and indeed I had no thought to spare for the subject; I only remember that when the interview was over, she sent for me to her room, and referred with great displeasure to the frequent visits I paid the princess, who was, in her words, une femme capable de tout.I kissed her hand (this was what I always did when I wanted to cut short a conversation) and went off to my room.Zinaïda’s tears had completely overwhelmed me; I positively did not know what to think, and was ready to cry myself; I was a child after all, in spite of my sixteen years.I had now given up thinking about Malevsky, though Byelovzorov looked more and more threatening every day, and glared at the wily count like a wolf at a sheep; but I thought of nothing and of no one.I was lost in imaginings, and was always seeking seclusion and solitude.I was particularly fond of the ruined greenhouse.I would climb up on the high wall, and perch myself, and sit there, such an unhappy, lonely, and melancholy youth, that I felt sorry for myself—and how consolatory where those mournful sensations, how I revelled in them!..."
"一天，我正坐在墙上眺望远方，听着钟声…… 突然间有什么东西飘过我——既不是风的气息，也不是我的颤抖，而是一阵芬芳——就好像是有什么人靠近了一样…… 我向下看去。就在下面的小径上，齐娜依达身穿一条灰色的连衣裙，肩上撑着一把阳伞，独自一人匆匆走着。她看见了我，停下脚步，把草帽檐往后一推，抬起了那双温柔的眼睛看着我。","One day I was sitting on the wall looking into the distance and listening to the ringing of the bells....Suddenly something floated up to me—not a breath of wind and not a shiver, but as it were a whiff of fragrance—as it were, a sense of some one’s being near....I looked down.Below, on the path, in a light greyish gown, with a pink parasol on her shoulder, was Zinaïda, hurrying along.She caught sight of me, stopped, and pushing back the brim of her straw hat, she raised her velvety eyes to me."
"“您在那么高的地方做什么呀？”她脸上带着怪笑问我。“下来，”她继续说道，“您总是说爱我，您要是真爱我的话，就跳到路上，到我这儿来吧。”","‘What are you doing up there at such a height?’ she asked me with a rather queer smile.‘Come,’ she went on, ‘you always declare you love me; jump down into the road to me if you really do love me.’"
"齐娜依达还没说完话我就跳下去了，就好像有什么人在背后猛推了我一把。墙大概有14英尺高。我两脚着了地，但是冲力太大，我没能站住脚；我摔倒了，昏迷了一阵。当我清醒的时候，我没有睁开眼，我感觉到齐娜依达就在我身边。“我亲爱的孩子啊，”她说着话，朝我弯下腰，语气里带着一种略微紧张的温柔，“你怎么会这么做呢，亲爱的；你怎么能这么听话呢？…… 你知道我爱你的…… 起来吧。”","Zinaïda had hardly uttered those words when I flew down, just as though some one had given me a violent push from behind.The wall was about fourteen feet high.I reached the ground on my feet, but the shock was so great that I could not keep my footing; I fell down, and for an instant fainted away.When I came to myself again, without opening my eyes, I felt Zinaïda beside me.‘My dear boy,’ she was saying, bending over me, and there was a note of alarmed tenderness in her voice, ‘how could you do it, dear; how could you obey?...You know I love you....Get up.’"
"她的胸脯就贴近我身边起伏着，她的双手轻抚着我的头，突然间——那一刻我的感觉是怎样的啊——她那柔软清新的双唇开始亲吻我的整个脸孔…… 甚至还碰到了我的嘴唇…… 虽然我还闭着眼睛，可齐娜依达大概从我的表情猜出我已经恢复了意识，她忽地站了起来说道：“快点起来吧，淘气鬼，真傻，你干嘛躺在灰尘里？”我站起来了。“把阳伞给我拿过来。”齐娜依达说，“我把它扔在一边了，别那样盯着我看…… 真好笑！您没伤着吧？大概是被荨麻刺扎着了吧？跟您说了，别盯着我看…… 可他不懂，也不答话。”她好像自言自语地说着…… “回家去吧，沃尔德玛先生，把身上洗干净，还有，不许跟着我，不然我会生气的，而且再也不…… ”","Her bosom was heaving close to me, her hands were caressing my head, and suddenly—what were my emotions at that moment—her soft, fresh lips began covering my face with kisses ... they touched my lips....But then Zinaïda probably guessed by the expression of my face that I had regained consciousness, though I still kept my eyes closed, and rising rapidly to her feet, she said: ‘Come, get up, naughty boy, silly, why are you lying in the dust?’I got up.‘Give me my parasol,’ said Zinaïda, ‘I threw it down somewhere, and don’t stare at me like that ... what ridiculous nonsense!you’re not hurt, are you?stung by the nettles, I daresay?Don’t stare at me, I tell you....But he doesn’t understand, he doesn’t answer,’ she added, as though to herself....‘Go home,M’sieu’Voldemar, brush yourself, and don’t dare to follow me, or i shall be angry, and never again....’"
"她话还没说完，就立刻离开了，而我就坐在路边…… 我的腿还站不起来。荨麻刺扎进了我的手里，我的后背疼得厉害，头晕目眩；可是，当时我所经历的欣喜若狂的感觉却再也没有在我生命中再次出现过。这种幸福的感觉在我的全身变成一种甜蜜的痛楚，我最后高兴得又蹦又跳，喊了出来。是呀，我还是个孩子呢。","She did not finish her sentence, but walked rapidly away, while I sat down by the side of the road ... my legs would not support me.The nettles had stung my hands, my back ached, and my head was giddy; but the feeling of rapture I experienced then has never come a second time in my life.It turned to a sweet ache in all my limbs and found expression at last in joyful hops and skips and shouts.Yes, I was still a child."
"第十三章","CHAPTER XIII"
"那一整天我都自豪不已，整个身心都轻松愉快，我脸上还强烈地留着齐娜依达吻我的感觉。回想起她说的每一个字，我都幸福得发抖，我多么珍惜这意外飞来的幸福，甚至感到一阵害怕，甚至不愿见到她，不愿见到这个给我这些新奇感受的人。我似乎不该再向命运要求什么了，现在我应该“离开，深吸最后一口气，然后死去”。可是第二天我去厢房的时候感到非常窘迫不安，我竭力把这种不安隐藏起来，装出一副谦虚、自信的样子，这样才同一个明显希望别人知道他是个善于保守秘密的人的身份相符。齐娜依达神情自若地接待了我，没有任何激动，她只是朝我晃晃手指，问我有没有瘀伤。我那谦虚、自信和故作神秘的样子顷刻间便消失了，随之而去的还有我那局促不安的心情。当然，我也没有期望什么特别的事情，但是齐娜依达泰然自若的神态给我泼了一盆冷水。我明白了，我在她眼里只是个孩子，这让我难过极了！齐娜依达在屋子里走来走去，每当她看我时就掠过一丝微笑，但我清楚地看出来，她的思绪在远方……“我应不应该先说说昨天的事，”我犹豫着，“问问她，她那么匆匆忙忙地去哪儿了，也好彻底地弄明白”…… 可我只是绝望地把手一挥，在一个角落里坐了下来。","I was so proud and light-hearted all that day, I so vividly retained on my face the feeling of Zinaïda’s kisses, with such a shudder of delight I recalled every word she had uttered, I so hugged my unexpected happiness that I felt positively afraid, positively unwilling to see her, who had given rise to these new sensations.It seemed to me that now I could ask nothing more of fate, that now I ought to ‘go, and draw a deep last sigh and die.’But, next day, when I went into the lodge, I felt great embarrassment, which I tried to conceal under a show of modest confidence, befitting a man who wishes to make it apparent that he knows how to keep a secret.Zinaïda received me very simply, without any emotion, she simply shook her finger at me and asked me, whether I wasn’t black and blue?All my modest confidence and air of mystery vanished instantaneously and with them my embarrassment.Of course, I had not expected anything particular, but Zinaïda’s composure was like a bucket of cold water thrown over me.I realised that in her eyes I was a child, and was extremely miserable!Zinaïda walked up and down the room, giving me a quick smile, whenever she caught my eye, but her thoughts were far away, I saw that clearly.... ’Shall I begin about what happened yesterday myself,‘ I pondered; ’ask her, where she was hurrying off so fast, so as to find out once for all’ ... but with a gesture of despair, I merely went and sat down in a corner."
"别洛夫佐罗夫进来了；看到他我觉得轻松多了。","Byelovzorov came in; I felt relieved to see him."
"“我还没能为您找到一匹温顺的马，”他愁眉苦脸地说，“弗列伊塔格保证给我找一匹，可我一点把握都没有，我担心。”","‘I’ve not been able to find you a quiet horse,’ he said in a sulky voice; ‘Freitag warrants one, but I don’t feel any confidence in it, I am afraid.’"
"“您担心什么？”齐娜依达说，“我能问问吗？”","‘What are you afraid of?’ said Zinaïda; ‘allow me to inquire?’"
"“我担心什么？要知道您不会骑马啊。愿主保佑，天知道会发生什么！您怎么会突然冒出这个怪念头？”","‘What am I afraid of?Why, you don’t know how to ride.Lord save us, what might happen!What whim is this has come over you all of a sudden?’"
"“嘿，那是我自己的事，野兽先生。这样的话，我就去问彼得·瓦西里耶维奇。”……（我父亲的名字就是彼得·瓦西里耶维奇。我奇怪的是，她怎么能如此轻松、随意地提到他的名字，就好像她很确定他愿意为她效劳似的。）","‘Come, that’s my business, Sir Wild Beast.In that case I will ask Piotr Vassilievitch.’ ... (My father’s name was Piotr Vassilievitch.I was surprised at her mentioning his name so lightly and freely, as though she were confident of his readiness to do her a service.)"
"“哦，原来这样啊。”别洛夫佐罗夫回嘴道，“您要和他一块儿去骑马吗？”","‘Oh, indeed,’ retorted Byelovzorov, ‘you mean to go out riding with him then?’"
"“和他或者和别人去，这与您无关。总之，就是不和您去。”","‘With him or with some one else is nothing to do with you.Only not with you, anyway.’"
"“不和我去，”别洛夫佐罗夫重复了一遍，“您随便吧。好吧，我为您找一匹马来。”","‘Not with me,’ repeated Byelovzorov.‘As you wish.Well, I shall find you a horse.’"
"“只是记住，别给我送来一头母牛。先给您提个醒，我要骑马飞奔的。”","‘Yes, only mind now, don’t send some old cow.I warn you I want to gallop.’"
"“骑马飞奔……您要和谁去骑马，马列夫斯基吗？”","‘Gallop away by all means ... with whom is it, with Malevsky, you are going to ride?’"
"“为什么不能和他一起去，好斗先生？嘿，请放心，”她加了句，“别瞪眼。我也会带上您的。您知道马列夫斯基现在对我来说——呸！”她摇了摇头。","‘And why not with him, Mr. Pugnacity?Come, be quiet,’ she added, ‘and don’t glare.I’ll take you too.You know that to my mind now Malevsky’s—ugh!’She shook her head."
"“您这么说是为了安慰我。”别洛夫佐罗夫怨声怨气地说。","‘You say that to console me,’ growled Byelovzorov."
"齐娜依达眯起了眼睛。“这样安慰您了吗？呦……呦……呦……好斗先生！”末了她说，就像她找不到别的话了。“您呢，沃尔德玛先生，您愿意和我们一块儿去吗？”","Zinaïda half closed her eyes.‘Does that console you?O ... O ... O ... Mr. Pugnacity!’ she said at last, as though she could find no other word.‘And you, M’sieu’ Voldemar, would you come with us?’"
"“我不愿意……跟一大帮人一起。”我嘟囔着，没有抬起眼睛。","‘I don’t care to ... in a large party,’ I muttered, not raising my eyes."
"“您喜欢两人单独一起？……好吧，那就各自玩各自的吧。”她叹了口气说，“去吧，别洛夫佐罗夫，振作一点。明天我一定得有匹马。”","‘You prefer a tête-à-tête?...Well, freedom to the free, and heaven to the saints,’ she commented with a sigh.‘Go along, Byelovzorov, and bestir yourself.I must have a horse for tomorrow.’"
"“可是钱从哪儿来？”老公爵夫人插了一句。","‘Oh, and where’s the money to come from?’ put in the old princess."
"齐娜依达皱了下眉头。","Zinaïda scowled."
"“我不会向您要这笔钱的；别洛夫佐罗夫会相信我的。”","‘I won’t ask you for it; Byelovzorov will trust me.’"
"“他会相信你的，是吗？”……老公爵夫人嘟囔着，她突然扯着嗓子大声叫道，“杜妮亚什卡！”","‘He’ll trust you, will he?’ ... grumbled the old princess, and all of a sudden she screeched at the top of her voice, ‘Duniashka!’"
"“妈妈，我给过您一个铃铛的。”齐娜依达说。","‘Maman, I have given you a bell to ring,’ observed Zinaïda."
"“杜妮亚什卡！”老夫人又叫道。","‘Duniashka!’ repeated the old lady."
"别洛夫佐罗夫告辞了；我和他一同离开了。齐娜依达没有留我。","Byelovzorov took leave; I went away with him.Zinaïda did not try to detain me."
"第十四章","CHAPTER XIV"
"第二天我起了个大早，给自己削了根手杖，动身到城门外去了。我想去散散心。那天天气非常好，阳光明媚，也不太热。欢快清新的微风在大地上温柔地嬉戏，沙沙作响，微风吹得万物轻轻摆动，但又什么都没有惊扰。我在山间和树林里逛了很长时间；我觉得一点儿也不开心；我离开家就是有意让自己陷入忧伤的，但是青春，美好的天气，清爽的空气，疾步如飞的快感，独自在隐蔽处仰卧在茵茵草地上悠闲自得的心情反而占了上风；那些终身难忘的话和亲吻又一次涌上了我的心头。想到齐娜依达无论如何都不会对我的胆量和英勇有失公允，我心里就美滋滋的……“对她来说，其他人也许比我好。”我暗暗想着，“随他们去！他们只会说他们要去干什么，而我却已经做到了。我还能为她做些什么呢？”我开始胡思乱想了。我开始想象自己如何将她从敌人手里拯救出来；我如何满身血迹地将她从监狱里搭救出来，然后倒在她脚下死去。我想起了挂在我家客厅里挂的一幅画——《带着玛蒂尔达离开的马勒克·阿代尔》——一只色彩斑斓的啄木鸟的出现吸引了我的注意，它正忙碌地沿着一只白桦树的细树干往上爬，然后慌慌张张地从树干后伸头探望，忽右忽左，就像乐师在拉低音古提琴时的样子。","The next day I got up early, cut myself a stick, and set off beyond the town-gates.I thought I would walk off my sorrow.It was a lovely day, bright and not too hot, a fresh sportive breeze roved over the earth with temperate rustle and frolic, setting all things a-flutter and harassing nothing.I wandered a long while over hills and through woods; I had not felt happy, I had left home with the intention of giving myself up to melancholy, but youth, the exquisite weather, the fresh air, the pleasure of rapid motion, the sweetness of repose, lying on the thick grass in a solitary nook, gained the upper hand; the memory of those never-to-be-forgotten words, those kisses, forced itself once more upon my soul.It was sweet to me to think that Zinaïda could not, anyway, fail to do justice to my courage, my heroism....‘ Others may seem better to her than I,’ I mused, ‘let them!But others only say what they would do, while I have done it.And what more would I not do for her?’My fancy set to work.I began picturing to myself how I would save her from the hands of enemies; how, covered with blood I would tear her by force from prison, and expire at her feet.I remembered a picture hanging in our drawing-room—Malek Adel bearing away Matilda—but at that point my attention was absorbed by the appearance of a speckled woodpecker who climbed busily up the slender stem of a birch-tree and peeped out uneasily from behind it, first to the right, then to the left, like a musician behind the bass-viol."
"我唱了《不是这白雪》，然后又唱了当时很流行的一首歌——《当西风吹拂的时候，我等着你》，之后我高声朗诵了霍米亚科夫的悲剧中叶尔马克对星星的一段独白。我本来打算写一首伤感的诗，甚至都想好了每个诗节结尾的句子：“啊，齐娜依达，齐娜依达！”但却没能写下去。这时，已经到吃饭的时间了。我下了山，走在山谷里；有一条狭窄的沙土小径，弯弯折折通向城里。我沿着小径走着……身后传来一阵低沉的马蹄声。我出于本能地四下望了望，站住了，摘下帽子。我看见了父亲和齐娜依达。他们正肩并肩地骑着马。父亲俯下身子，正对她说着些什么，他的手按在马颈上，他在微笑。齐娜依达静静地听着，严肃地垂下眼睛，紧闭着嘴唇。开始我只看见他们两个；但是过了一会儿，别洛夫佐罗夫在林间空地的转弯处出现了，他穿着一件带有短披风的骑兵制服，骑着一匹汗津津的黑马。这匹骏马昂起头，打着响鼻，跳跃着，骑手立刻按住了它，策鞭它前进。我躲在一旁。父亲勒紧缰绳，离开了齐娜依达，她慢慢地抬起眼睛望着他，一块策马飞奔出去……别洛夫佐罗夫追在他们后面，他身后的军刀叮当作响。“他的脸红得像螃蟹一样，”我暗想，“可是她……为什么她脸色如此惨白？在外面骑了一早晨的马，所以脸色惨白？”","Then I sang ‘Not the white snows,’ and passed from that to a song well known at that period: ‘I await thee, when the wanton zephyr,’ then I began reading aloud Yermak’s address to the stars from Homyakov’s tragedy.I made an attempt to compose something myself in a sentimental vein, and invented the line which was to conclude each verse: ‘O Zinaïda, Zinaïda!’ but could get no further with it.Meanwhile it was getting on towards dinner-time.I went down into the valley; a narrow sandy path winding through it led to the town.I walked along this path....The dull thud of horses' hoofs resounded behind me.I looked round instinctively, stood still and took off my cap.I saw my father and Zinaïda.They were riding side by side.My father was saying something to her, bending right over to her, his hand propped on the horses’ neck, he was smiling.Zinaïda listened to him in silence, her eyes severely cast down, and her lips tightly pressed together.At first I saw them only; but a few instants later, Byelovzorov came into sight round a bend in the glade, he was wearing a hussar’s uniform with a pelisse, and riding a foaming black horse.The gallant horse tossed its head, snorted and pranced from side to side, his rider was at once holding him in and spurring him on.I stood aside.My father gathered up the reins, moved away from Zinaïda, she slowly raised her eyes to him, and both galloped off ... Byelovzorov flew after them, his sabre clattering behind him.‘He’s as red as a crab,’ I reflected, ‘while she ... why’s she so pale?out riding the whole morning, and pale?’"
"我加快了脚步，在吃饭前正好赶到了家。父亲已经换好了用餐时的衣服，梳洗完毕，精神焕发地坐在母亲的椅子旁边；他正用平稳悦耳的嗓音读《辩论报》中的一篇文章；但是母亲心不在焉地听着，她一见我就问我这一整天去哪儿了，又说她不喜欢我去鬼才知道的地方闲逛，和鬼才知道的什么人鬼混。“可我只是自己一个人散步去了。”我正要回答，可是看了父亲一眼，不知为什么我就什么都不想说了。","I redoubled my pace, and got home just at dinner-time.My father was already sitting by my mother’s chair, dressed for dinner, washed and fresh; he was reading an article from the Journal des Débats in his smooth musical voice; but my mother heard him without attention, and when she saw me, asked where I had been to all day long, and added that she didn’t like this gadding about God knows where, and God knows in what company.‘But I have been walking alone,’ I was on the point of replying, but I looked at my father, and for some reason or other held my peace."

"接下来的五六天中，我几乎没有看到齐娜依达；她说她病了，可是这也没有阻止常客们来小厢房——用他们的话说——来值班，所有人都来了，只有马伊达诺夫除外，一旦没有机会热情高涨，他就会变得垂头丧气，愁眉苦脸的。别洛夫佐罗夫闷闷不乐地坐在角落里，满脸通红，扣子都扣到喉咙口了；马列夫斯基精致的脸上经常流露出不怀好意的微笑；他确实失宠于齐娜依达了，于是就特别专心地陪在老公爵夫人的身边，甚至陪她乘坐出租马车去拜访总督大人。这次拜访却无功而返，甚至马列夫斯基还碰上了不愉快的事；有人向他问起了关于工程部队一些官员的丑闻，他不得不为自己辩解，说自己那时少不经事。卢申每天来两次，但待得不久；自从我们上次毫无保留的谈话后，我就有点怕他了，但同时我又打心眼里喜欢他。有一次他和我在涅斯库奇花园内散步，他非常友善、亲切，还告诉我各种植物花草的名字和特性，突然间他敲了一下自己的脑门，莫名其妙地叫道：“我这个傻瓜，还以为她是个爱卖弄风情的女人！很明显，自我牺牲对于某些人来说也是快乐的。”","For the next five or six days I hardly saw Zinaïda; she said she was ill, which did not, however, prevent the usual visitors from calling at the lodge to pay—as they expressed it, their duty—all, that is, except Meidanov, who promptly grew dejected and sulky when he had not an opportunity of being enthusiastic.Byelovzorov sat sullen and red-faced in a corner, buttoned up to the throat; on the refined face of Malevsky there flickered continually an evil smile; he had really fallen into disfavour with Zinaïda, and waited with special assiduity on the old princess, and even went with her in a hired coach to call on the Governor General.This expedition turned out unsuccessful, however, and even led to an unpleasant experience for Malevsky; he was reminded of some scandal to do with certain officers of the engineers, and was forced in his explanations to plead his youth and inexperience at the time.Lushin came twice a day, but did not stay long; I was rather afraid of him after our last unreserved conversation, and at the same time felt a genuine attraction to him.He went a walk with me one day in the Neskutchny gardens, was very good-natured and nice, told me the names and properties of various plants and flowers, and suddenly, à propos of nothing at all, cried, hitting himself on his forehead, ‘And I, poor fool, thought her a flirt!it’s clear self-sacrifice is sweet for some people!’"
"“您这话是什么意思？”我问。","‘What do you mean by that?’I inquired."
"“我本不想告诉您任何事的。”卢申突然答道。","‘I don’t mean to tell you anything,’ Lushin replied abruptly."
"齐娜依达躲着我；我一出现——我不由得注意到——就会让她不愉快。她不由自主地躲开我……不由自主地；这就是让人苦恼的事，也是让我痛苦万分的事。可是我一点办法也没有，我试着不越过她家的小径，只在远处望着她，可这样我也不能总是做得到。就像以前一样，她身上正发生着让人无法理解的变化；她的面孔变了，她的整个人都变了。那个温暖而平静的傍晚，她身上发生的变化尤其让我惊讶不已。我坐在一大片接骨树丛下的一条低矮的长椅上；我喜欢那个僻静的角落，从那儿我能看见齐娜依达的窗户。我坐在那儿；在我的头顶上，有一只小鸟在昏暗的树叶中忙碌地跳来跳去；一只灰色的猫伸直了身子，小心翼翼地溜进花园；刚刚出现的甲虫在半明半暗的天幕下低沉地嗡嗡鸣叫。我坐在那儿，盯着窗户，我等待着，看那窗子是不是会打开：窗户果真打开了，齐娜依达出现在窗口。她穿了件白色连衣裙，而她自己，她的脸、肩膀、手臂，都像她的裙子一样苍白。她站了很久，一动不动，皱紧着眉头，直直地看着前方。我从未见过她这个样子。然后她握紧了双手，举到了唇边，又举到额头上，突然她松开了手指，把头发拢到耳朵后面，甩了甩头发，似乎带着一种决心点了点头，接着就砰地一声关上了窗子。","Zinaïda avoided me; my presence—I could not help noticing it—affected her disagreeably.She involuntarily turned away from me ... involuntarily; that was what was so bitter, that was what crushed me!But there was no help for it, and I tried not to cross her path, and only to watch her from a distance, in which I was not always successful.As before, something incomprehensible was happening to her; her face was different, she was different altogether.I was specially struck by the change that had taken place in her one warm still evening.I was sitting on a low garden bench under a spreading elderbush; I was fond of that nook; I could see from there the window of Zinaïda’s room.I sat there; over my head a little bird was busily hopping about in the darkness of the leaves; a grey cat, stretching herself at full length, crept warily about the garden, and the first beetles were heavily droning in the air, which was still clear, though it was not light.I sat and gazed at the window, and waited to see if it would open; it did open, and Zinaïda appeared at it.She had on a white dress, and she herself, her face, shoulders, and arms, were pale to whiteness.She stayed a long while without moving, and looked out straight before her from under her knitted brows.I had never known such a look on her.Then she clasped her hands tightly, raised them to her lips, to her forehead, and suddenly pulling her fingers apart, she pushed back her hair behind her ears, tossed it, and with a sort of determination nodded her head, and slammed-to the window."
"三天后她在花园里遇到了我。我正要走开，可她却拦住了我。","Three days later she met me in the garden.I was turning away, but she stopped me of herself."
"“把您的手臂给我，”她用以往亲切的语气对我说，“我们已经很久没说说话了。”","‘Give me your arm,’ she said to me with her old affectionateness, ‘it’s a long while since we have had a talk together.’"
"我偷偷看了她一眼；她的眼中充满了温柔，她的脸看上去好像透着薄雾一样露着微笑。","I stole a look at her; her eyes were full of a soft light, and her face seemed as it were smiling through a mist."
"“您还觉得不舒服吗？”我问她。","‘Are you still not well?’I asked her."
"“不了，现在都没事了。”她答着，然后摘了朵小小的红玫瑰。“我有点累，不过这会好的。”","‘No, that’s all over now,’ she answered, and she picked a small red rose.‘I am a little tired, but that too will pass off.’"
"“您又会变得像以前一样？”我问。","‘And will you be as you used to be again?’I asked."
"齐娜依达把玫瑰举到面前，我想象着花瓣反射的亮光投射到她的两颊上。“怎么，我变了吗？”她问我。","Zinaïda put the rose up to her face, and I fancied the reflection of its bright petals had fallen on her cheeks.‘Why, am I changed?’ she questioned me."
"“是的，您变了。”我低声答道。","‘Yes, you are changed,’ I answered in a low voice."
"“我知道我对您一直很冷淡，”齐娜依达开始说，“可您一定不要介意……我没有办法……哎，说这个干嘛！”","‘I have been cold to you, I know,’ began Zinaïda, ‘but you mustn’t pay attention to that ... I couldn’t help it....Come, why talk about it!’"
"“您不想让我爱您，就是这么回事！”我禁不住激动起来，沮丧地叫着。","‘You don’t want me to love you, that’s what it is!’I cried gloomily, in an involuntary outburst."
"“不，请爱我，但不要像以前那样。”","‘No, love me, but not as you did.’"
"“那要怎样？”","‘How then?’"
"“我们做朋友吧——从现在开始！”齐娜依达把玫瑰递给我闻。“听着，要知道，我比您大得多——我都可以做您的姑姑了，这是真的；好吧，不是姑姑，但也是大姐姐了。可您……”","‘Let us be friends—come now!’Zinaïda gave me the rose to smell.‘Listen, you know I’m much older than you—I might be your aunt, really; well, not your aunt, but an older sister.And you ...’"
"“您把我当成小孩子了。”我打断了她。","‘You think me a child,’ I interrupted."
"“好吧，是的，我是把你当成个小孩子了，但却是个可爱、聪明、我非常喜欢的孩子。知道了吧？从今天起，我任命您为我的少年侍卫；您别忘了，少年侍卫是寸步不离自己的女王的。这是您新身份的标志。”她补充了一句，说着把玫瑰插到我外套的纽扣孔里，“这是我的宠爱的标志。”","‘Well, yes, a child, but a dear, good clever one, whom I love very much.Do you know what?From this day forth I confer on you the rank of page to me; and don’t you forget that pages have to keep close to their ladies.Here is the token of your new dignity,’ she added, sticking the rose in the buttonhole of my jacket, ‘the token of my favour.’"
"“我曾经得到过您别样的宠爱。”我嘀咕着说。","‘I once received other favours from you,’ I muttered."
"“哈！”齐娜依达斜着眼瞥了我一眼，说道，“他的记性可真好！好吧？我已经准备好了……”说着，她向我俯下身子，在我的前额留下了一个纯洁、平静的吻。","‘Ah!’ commented Zinaïda, and she gave me a sidelong look, ‘What a memory he has!Well?I’m quite ready now ...’ And stooping to me, she imprinted on my forehead a pure, tranquil kiss."
"我只是看着她，可她却转过身去，说道：“跟着我吧，我的侍卫。”然后就进了小厢房。我跟着她——整个人惊愕不已。我暗想：“这位温柔、通情达理的女孩是我曾经认识的齐娜依达吗？”我觉得她的每个脚步都更加沉稳，她的整个人都更端庄、优雅了……","I only looked at her, while she turned away, and saying, ‘Follow me, my page,’ went into the lodge.I followed her—all in amazement.‘Can this gentle, reasonable girl,’ I thought, ‘be the Zinaïda I used to know?’ I fancied her very walk was quieter, her whole figure statelier and more graceful ..."
"天呀！爱情又精力充沛地在我内心燃烧起来了。","And, mercy!with what fresh force love burned within me!"
"第十六章","CHAPTER XVI"
"饭后，常客们又聚集在厢房里，公爵小姐出来招待他们。所有人都在全力献殷勤，就像那第一个让我难以忘怀的夜晚一样；甚至连尼尔马茨基也跛着脚来看她；马伊达诺夫这次来得最早，他带来几首新诗。我们又玩了罚物游戏，但是没有怪诞的玩笑，没有恶作剧和吵闹了——茨冈人的做派消失了。齐娜依达为这次游戏增添了一种不同的乐趣。我作为她的侍卫坐在了她身边。除此以外，她还提议每个被罚的人应该说出自己的一个梦；但是这个提议并不成功。这些梦不是没有意思（别洛夫佐罗夫梦见他用鲤鱼喂马，而且那匹马的头是木头的），就是不合情理，或是胡编乱造的。马伊达诺夫给我们讲了一个普通的传奇故事；故事里有坟墓，弹七弦琴的天使，会讲话的花朵和远方飘来的音乐。齐娜依达没有让他说完。“如果我们都是编得故事，”她说，“那就每个人都编个故事讲吧，不准找借口。“第一个必须讲故事的又是别洛夫佐罗夫。","After dinner the usual party assembled again at the lodge, and the young princess came out to them.All were there in full force, just as on that first evening which I never forgot; even Nirmatsky had limped to see her; Meidanov came this time earliest of all, he brought some new verses.The games of forfeits began again, but without the strange pranks, the practical jokes and noise—the gipsy element had vanished.Zinaïda gave a different tone to the proceedings.I sat beside her by virtue of my office as page.Among other things, she proposed that any one who had to pay a forfeit should tell his dream; but this was not successful.The dreams were either uninteresting (Byelovzorov had dreamed that he fed his mare on carp, and that she had a wooden head), or unnatural and invented.Meidanov regaled us with a regular romance; there were sepulchres in it, and angels with lyres, and talking flowers and music wafted from afar.Zinaïda did not let him finish.‘If we are to have compositions,’ she said, ‘let every one tell something made up, and no pretence about it.’The first who had to speak was again Byelovzorov."
"这个年轻的骑兵窘迫起来。“我什么也编不出来！”他叫道。","The young hussar was confused.‘I can’t make up anything!’ he cried."
"“胡说八道！”齐娜依达说。“好吧，比方说，想象一下您已经结婚了，告诉我们您会怎么样对您的妻子。您会把她锁起来吗？”","‘What nonsense!’ said Zinaïda.‘Well, imagine, for instance, you are married, and tell us how you would treat your wife.Would you lock her up?’"
"“嗯，我会把她锁起来的。”","‘Yes, I should lock her up.’"
"“您会亲自陪着她吗？”","‘And would you stay with her yourself?’"
"“嗯，我当然会亲自陪着她了。”","‘Yes, I should certainly stay with her myself.’"
"“很好。嗯，但是如果她厌倦了那样，背叛了您呢？”","‘Very good.Well, but if she got sick of that, and she deceived you?’"
"“我会杀了她。”","‘I should kill her.’"
"“那如果她逃跑了呢？”","‘And if she ran away?’"
"“我会抓住她，一样把她杀了。”","‘I should catch her up and kill her all the same.’"
"“哦。假设我是您的妻子，那您会怎么做？”","‘Oh.And suppose now I were your wife, what would you do then?’"
"别洛夫佐罗夫沉默了一会儿。“我会自杀……”","Byelovzorov was silent a minute.‘I should kill myself....’"
"齐娜依达笑了。“我明白了，您的故事可不长。”","Zinaïda laughed.‘I see yours is not a long story.’"
"第二个讲故事的是齐娜依达。她看着天花板，想了一会儿。“好吧，听我说，”她终于开口了，“我想的是……想象在一个夏日的夜晚，你们在一座辉煌的宫殿里参加一个盛大的舞会。舞会是一位年轻的女王举办的。到处都是黄金、大理石、水晶、绸缎、灯光、钻石、鲜花和芳香，随你能想到的任何奢华的东西。”","The next forfeit was Zinaïda’s.She looked at the ceiling and considered.‘Well, listen,’ she began at last, ‘what I have thought of....Picture to yourselves a magnificent palace, a summer night, and a marvellous ball.This ball is given by a young queen.Everywhere gold and marble, crystal, silk, lights, diamonds, flowers, fragrant scents, every caprice of luxury.’"
"“您喜欢奢华吗？”卢申插嘴问道。“奢华是美的，”她答道，“我喜欢一切美丽的事物。”","‘You love luxury?’Lushin interposed.‘Luxury is beautiful,’ she retorted; ‘I love everything beautiful.’"
"“甚至超过了高贵的事物吗？”他又问。","‘More than what is noble?’ he asked."
"“这个问题很巧妙，不过我不懂。别打断我。总之舞会是盛大隆重的。那天客人云集，他们个个年轻、英俊、勇敢，而且都疯狂地爱着女王。”","‘That’s something clever, I don’t understand it.Don’t interrupt me.So the ball is magnificent.There are crowds of guests, all of them are young, handsome, and brave, all are frantically in love with the queen.’"
"“来宾中没有女士吗？”马列夫斯基问道。","‘Are there no women among the guests?’ queried Malevsky."
"“没有——嗯等一下——有，有几位。”","‘No—or wait a minute—yes, there are some.’"
"“她们都长得很丑吗？”","‘Are they all ugly?’"
"“不，也很动人。不过男士们都爱上了女王。她亭亭玉立、举止优雅，乌黑的秀发上戴了一顶小巧的金色王冠。”","‘No, charming.But the men are all in love with the queen.She is tall and graceful; she has a little gold diadem on her black hair.’"
"我看着齐娜依达，那一刻她似乎在我们所有人之上，她那巍然不动的眉宇之间闪烁着如此耀眼的智慧和这般的力量，我暗想：“您就是那位女王。”","I looked at Zinaïda, and at that instant she seemed to me so much above all of us, there was such bright intelligence, and such power about her unruffled brows, that I thought: ‘You are that queen!’"
"“他们都围在她身边，”齐娜依达继续说，“大家都纷纷把最谄媚的话献给她。”","‘They all throng about her,’ Zinaïda went on, ‘and all lavish the most flattering speeches upon her.’"
"“那她喜欢恭维话吗？”卢申问道。","‘And she likes flattery?’Lushin queried."
"“真让人无法忍受！他总是插嘴…… 谁不喜欢恭维话？”","‘What an intolerable person!he keeps interrupting ... who doesn’t like flattery?’"
"“最后一个问题，”马列夫斯基说道，“女王已经有丈夫了吗？”","‘One more last question,’ observed Malevsky, ‘has the queen a husband?’"
"“我还没有想过这点呢。没有，她为什么要有丈夫？”","‘I hadn’t thought about that.No, why should she have a husband?’"
"“那当然，”马列夫斯基赞成地说道，“她为什么要有丈夫呢？”","‘To be sure,’ assented Malevsky, ‘why should she have a husband?’"
"“安静！”马伊达诺夫用法语叫道，不过他法语说得很糟。","‘Silence!’ cried Meidanov in French, which he spoke very badly."
"“谢谢您！”齐娜依达对她说。“总之，女王听着他们的恭维话，听着音乐，但是客人中她哪个都不看一眼。六扇窗子从上到下，从地板到天花板，全部敞开，窗外是繁星闪烁的深黑色夜空和树木参天的漆黑的花园。女王向外望着花园。在外面，树丛间有一个喷泉；喷泉在黑暗中透着白色，高高地耸立着，高得像幽灵一样。透过谈话声和音乐声，女王听着泉水柔缓的溅落声。她望着，心里想：你们都是绅士，高贵、聪明、富有，你们围在我身边，把我说的每个字奉为至宝，你们准备随时在我脚边死去，我主宰着你们……但是在那儿，在喷泉边，在飞溅的水花边站着我爱的人，他等着我，主宰着我。他没有华丽的服饰或珍贵的宝石，没人认识他，可他却等着我，他确信我会来的——我会来的——当我要去找他，和他待在一起的时候，没有什么力量能阻止我，我会和他消失在那里，消失在漆黑的花园中，消失在树丛的低语下，消失在泉水的溅落声中……”齐娜依达停住不语了。","‘Merci!’Zinaïda said to him.‘And so the queen hears their speeches, and hears the music, but does not look at one of the guests.Six windows are open from top to bottom, from floor to ceiling, and beyond them is a dark sky with big stars, a dark garden with big trees.The queen gazes out into the garden.Out there among the trees is a fountain; it is white in the darkness, and rises up tall, tall as an apparition.The queen hears, through the talk and the music, the soft splash of its waters.She gazes and thinks: you are all, gentlemen, noble, clever, and rich, you crowd round me, you treasure every word I utter, you are all ready to die at my feet, I hold you in my power ... but out there, by the fountain, by that splashing water, stands and waits he whom I love, who holds me in his power.He has neither rich raiment nor precious stones, no one knows him, but he awaits me, and is certain I shall come—and I shall come—and there is no power that could stop me when I want to go out to him, and to stay with him, and be lost with him out there in the darkness of the garden, under the whispering of the trees, and the splash of the fountain ...’ Zinaïda ceased."
"“这是个编造的故事吗？”马列夫斯基狡猾地问道。齐娜依达甚至都没看他一眼。","‘Is that a made-up story?’Malevsky inquired slyly.Zinaïda did not even look at him."
"“那我们应该怎么做呢，先生们？”卢申突然说话了，“如果我们就在那些客人中间，而且认识喷泉旁边的那个幸运的家伙？”","‘And what should we have done, gentlemen?’Lushin began suddenly, ‘if we had been among the guests, and had known of the lucky fellow at the fountain?’"
"“等一下，等一下。”齐娜依达插话说，“我来告诉你们你们每个人该怎么做。您，别洛夫佐罗夫，会向他挑战进行决斗；您，马伊达诺夫，会写首短诗嘲讽他…… 不，可您不会写嘲讽诗，您会写一首关于他的巴比埃体长诗，而且把它刊登在《电讯报》上。您，尼尔马茨基，会向他借…… 不，您会放高利贷给他；您，医生……”她停下来。“好吧，我确实不知道您会做些什么……”","‘Stop a minute, stop a minute,’ interposed Zinaïda, ‘I will tell you myself what each of you would have done.You, Byelovzorov, would have challenged him to a duel; you, Meidanov, would have written an epigram on him ... No, though, you can’t write epigrams, you would have made up a long poem on him in the style of Barbier, and would have inserted your production in the Telegraph.You, Nirmatsky, would have borrowed ... no, you would have lent him money at high interest; you, doctor,…’ she stopped.‘There, I really don’t know what you would have done....’"
"“以皇家御医的身份，”卢申回答道，“我会建议女王，当她不想招待客人的时候，不要举行舞会……”","‘In the capacity of court physician,’ answered Lushin, ‘I would have advised the queen not to give balls when she was not in the humour for entertaining her guests....’"
"“或许您是对的。您呢？伯爵……”","‘Perhaps you would have been right.And you, Count?...’"
"“我？”马列夫斯基重复着，露出了邪恶的微笑……","‘And I?’ repeated Malevsky with his evil smile...."
"“您会盛给他有毒的蜜饯。”马列夫斯基脸色稍动，片刻间呈现出一副犹太人的神情，但他立刻笑了起来。","‘You would offer him a poisoned sweetmeat.’Malevsky’s face changed slightly, and assumed for an instant a Jewish expression, but he laughed directly."
"“至于您，沃尔德玛，……”齐娜依达继续说道，“不过到此为止；咱们换个游戏玩吧。”","‘And as for you, Voldemar,...’ Zinaïda went on, ‘but that’s enough, though; let us play another game.’"
"“沃尔德玛先生，作为女王的侍卫，您将会在女王跑进花园的时候提着她衣袍的后摆。”马列夫斯基恶惺惺地说道。","‘M’sieu Voldemar, as the queen’s page, would have held up her train when she ran into the garden,’ Malevsky remarked malignantly."
"我气得脸通红，可齐娜依达马上把手搭在我的肩膀上，站了起来，声音有点颤抖地说：“我绝不允许阁下在这里放肆无礼，所以我请您离开。”她用手指向了门。","I was crimson with anger, but Zinaïda hurriedly laid a hand on my shoulder, and getting up, said in a rather shaky voice: ‘I have never given your excellency the right to be rude, and therefore I will ask you to leave us.’She pointed to the door."
"“原谅我的话吧，公爵小姐。”马列夫斯基喃喃地说，脸色变得相当苍白。","‘Upon my word, princess,’ muttered Malevsky, and he turned quite pale."
"“公爵小姐说得对。”别洛夫佐罗夫大声说道，他也站了起来。","‘The princess is right,’ cried Byelovzorov, and he too rose."
"“天呀，我什么也不知道，”马列夫斯基继续说，“我的话里什么意思也没有，我想，那会……我没有一点儿要冒犯您的意思……请原谅我吧。”","‘Good God, I’d not the least idea,’ Malevsky went on, ‘in my words there was nothing, I think, that could ... I had no notion of offending you....Forgive me.’"
"齐娜依达冷冷地上下看了看他，冷笑了一下。“当然了，那就留下吧。”她说着，还随意挥了一下手臂。","Zinaïda looked him up and down coldly, and coldly smiled.‘Stay, then, certainly,’ she pronounced with a careless gesture of her arm."
"“沃尔德玛先生和我都没有必要生气。您以挖苦别人为乐……但愿这对您有好处。”","‘M’sieu Voldemar and I were needlessly incensed.It is your pleasure to sting ... may it do you good.’"
"“请原谅我吧。”马列夫斯基又重复了一遍；可是我，我的思绪一直停留在齐娜依达的手势上，再次对自己说，没有一个真正的女王会更威严地如此向一个失礼的臣子下逐客令的。","‘Forgive me,’ Malevsky repeated once more; while I, my thoughts dwelling on Zinaïda’s gesture, said to myself again that no real queen could with greater dignity have shown a presumptuous subject to the door."
"这场小风波后我们又玩了一会儿罚物游戏；可每个人都觉得很局促不安，倒不全是因为这场风波，而是另一种说不清道不明的沉重感。没人说起这种感觉，但每个人都清楚，在他们自己和身边的人身上都有这种感觉。马伊达诺夫向我们朗诵了他的诗；马列夫斯基过分热情地对这些诗大加赞赏。“他现在想表示他有多么友好。”卢申悄悄地对我说。不久我们就散了。齐娜依达像是沉入了幻想的思绪之中；老公爵夫人传话来说她头痛；尼尔马茨基开始抱怨起他的风湿了……","The game of forfeits went on for a short time after this little scene; every one felt rather ill at ease, not so much on account of this scene, as from another, not quite definite, but oppressive feeling.No one spoke of it, but every one was conscious of it in himself and in his neighbour.Meidanov read us his verses; and Malevsky praised them with exaggerated warmth.‘He wants to show how good he is now,’ Lushin whispered to me.We soon broke up.A mood of reverie seemed to have come upon Zinaïda; the old princess sent word that she had a headache; Nirmatsky began to complain of his rheumatism...."
"我久久不能入睡。齐娜依达的故事令我印象深刻。“故事中会有什么暗示吗？”我问着自己：“她在暗示谁，暗示着什么呢？如果真的有什么暗示……我要怎么办才好？不，不，不可能。”我低声说，翻了个身，灼热的脸颊也由一侧翻到另一侧。但是我记得齐娜依达讲故事时的神情……我记起了卢申在涅斯库奇花园里突发的感叹，记起了她对我突然转变的态度，这些都使我陷入猜想之中。“他是谁？”这三个字好像从黑暗中显现出来，就在眼前漂浮着；好像有片凶狠的乌云越压越低，悬在我头上，我感到压抑，等着它爆发。我近来对于很多事情都习惯了；我在扎谢金家看到了很多事情；她家的杂乱无章，蜡油残烛，折断了的刀叉，粗暴的沃尼法提，衣衫破烂的女仆们，老公爵夫人的言行举止——他们奇怪的生活方式已经不会让我惊讶……但是对于现在我在齐娜依达身上模糊觉察出的东西，我却总不能适应……“女骗子！”我母亲一天这样说她。女骗子——她，我的偶像，我的女神？这个词刺痛我了，我把头埋进枕头里，竭力不去想，我愤愤不平——但这时我又想，如果我就是喷泉旁那个幸运的家伙，我还会对什么不同意，还有什么不能牺牲的呢！……我的血液在身体内燃烧着、沸腾着。“花园……喷泉。”我暗暗思忖……“我要去花园。”我很快穿上了衣服，溜出屋子。夜色正浓，树木轻轻地沙沙作响，天空中吹下来一股柔和的凉气，菜园子那边飘来一阵茴香的气味。我走过了所有小径；我那轻轻的脚步声既让我自己慌乱，又为我壮胆；我停下脚步，等待着，听着自己咚咚急促的心跳。最后我走到了栅栏那儿，靠在一根细栅栏条上。忽然间，也许是我的错觉，在离我几步远的地方，一个女人的身影闪过…… 我屏住呼吸，圆睁着眼睛使劲向黑暗中望去。那是什么？我是真的听到了脚步声，或者还是我的心跳声？“谁在那儿？”我以几乎听不清的声音颤抖地问道。那又是什么，是低低的笑声……还是树叶沙沙作响声，或者只是耳边的叹息声？我感到害怕……“谁在那儿？”我又轻轻地问了一遍。","I could not for a long while get to sleep.I had been impressed by Zinaïda’s story.‘Can there have been a hint in it?’I asked myself: ‘and at whom and at what was she hinting?And if there really is anything to hint at ... how is one to make up one’s mind?No, no, it can’t be,’ I whispered, turning over from one hot cheek on to the other....But I remembered the expression of Zinaïda’s face during her story....I remembered the exclamation that had broken from Lushin in the Neskutchny gardens, the sudden change in her behaviour to me, and I was lost in conjectures.‘Who is he?’These three words seemed to stand before my eyes traced upon the darkness; a lowering malignant cloud seemed hanging over me, and I felt its oppressiveness, and waited for it to break.I had grown used to many things of late; I had learned much from what I had seen at the Zasyekins; their disorderly ways, tallow candle-ends, broken knives and forks, grumpy Vonifaty, and shabby maid-servants, the manners of the old princess—all their strange mode of life no longer struck me....But what I was dimly discerning now in Zinaïda, I could never get used to....‘An adventuress!’ my mother had said of her one day.An adventuress—she, my idol, my divinity?This word stabbed me, I tried to get away from it into my pillow, I was indignant—and at the same time what would I not have agreed to, what would I not have given only to be that lucky fellow at the fountain!...My blood was on fire and boiling within me.‘The garden ... the fountain,’ I mused....‘I will go into the garden.’I dressed quickly and slipped out of the house.The night was dark, the trees scarcely whispered, a soft chill air breathed down from the sky, a smell of fennel trailed across from the kitchen garden.I went through all the walks; the light sound of my own footsteps at once confused and emboldened me; I stood still, waited and heard my heart beating fast and loudly.At last I went up to the fence and leaned against the thin bar.Suddenly, or was it my fancy, a woman’s figure flashed by, a few paces from me ... I strained my eyes eagerly into the darkness, I held my breath.What was that?Did I hear steps, or was it my heart beating again?‘Who is here?’I faltered, hardly audibly.What was that again, a smothered laugh ... or a rustling in the leaves ... or a sigh just at my ear?I felt afraid ... ‘Who is here?’I repeated still more softly."
"突然刮起了一阵风；天空中划过一道光带；是颗陨落的星星。“齐娜依达？”我想叫出来，但是话到嘴边却咽下去了。突然间四下变得一片死寂，就像深夜往往会有的那种沉寂……就连树丛间的蚱蜢都不叫了——只听见某处窗子格格作响。我站了又站，最后走回自己的房间，躺在冷冰冰的床上。我有种奇怪的感觉：好像去赴了幽会，结果却落得孤身一人，而只与别人的幸福擦身而过。","The air blew in a gust for an instant; a streak of fire flashed across the sky; it was a star falling.‘Zinaïda?’I wanted to call, but the word died away on my lips.And all at once everything became profoundly still around, as is often the case in the middle of the night....Even the grasshoppers ceased their churr in the trees—only a window rattled somewhere.I stood and stood, and then went back to my room, to my chilled bed.I felt a strange sensation; as though I had gone to a tryst, and had been left lonely, and had passed close by another’s happiness."
"第十七章","CHAPTER XVII"
"接下来的一天，我只见了齐娜依达匆匆一眼：她和老公爵夫人乘出租马车要到某处去。可是我见到卢申了，而他只勉强赏了我一个招呼，我还见到了马列夫斯基。这位年轻的伯爵咧着嘴对我笑，还殷勤地和我说起话来。拜访小厢房的所有客人中，只有他成功地设法进了我家，而且还博得了我母亲的好感。我的父亲不喜欢他，还以带有几乎是侮辱性的礼节招待他。","The following day I only had a passing glimpse of Zinaïda: she was driving somewhere with the old princess in a cab.But I saw Lushin, who, however, barely vouchsafed me a greeting, and Malevsky.The young count grinned, and began affably talking to me.Of all those who visited at the lodge, he alone had succeeded in forcing his way into our house, and had favourably impressed my mother.My father did not take to him, and treated him with a civility almost insulting."
"“哈，侍卫先生，”马列夫斯基开口了，“见到您真高兴。您那迷人的女王在做什么？”","‘Ah, monsieur le page,’ began Malevsky, ‘delighted to meet you.What is your lovely queen doing?’"
"此时此刻，他那精神饱满、俊俏的脸蛋真叫我厌恶，他还用那么蔑视、嘲弄的眼神看着我，我根本就没有搭理他。","His fresh handsome face was so detestable to me at that moment, and he looked at me with such contemptuous amusement that I did not answer him at all."
"“您还生我的气？”他继续问道。“您何必呢？您要知道，又不是我把您叫做侍卫的，侍卫是要特别地陪伴女王左右的。但是请允许我说一句，您可没有很好地履行您的职责。”","‘Are you still angry?’ he went on.‘You’ve no reason to be.It wasn’t I who called you a page, you know, and pages attend queens especially.But allow me to remark that you perform your duties very badly.’"
"“此话怎讲？”","‘How so?’"
"“侍卫应该寸步不离自己的女王；侍卫应该知道女王的一举一动，事实上，侍卫应该看住自己的女王。”他压低了声音，补充了一句，“不管是白天还是晚上。”","‘Pages ought to be inseparable from their mistresses; pages ought to know everything they do, they ought, indeed, to watch over them,’ he added, lowering his voice, ‘day and night.’"
"“您是什么意思？”","‘What do you mean?’"
"“我是什么意思？我想我已经把自己的意思说得够清楚了。不管是白天还是晚上。白天还不大要紧，光天化日，到处都有人；但是晚上就要注意，别出什么麻烦的事。我劝您晚上不要睡觉，就看着，集中所有精神看着。您记住：在晚上，花园里，喷泉旁，这正是要看守的地方。您会感激我的。”","‘What do I mean?I express myself pretty clearly, I fancy.Day and night.By day it’s not so much matter; it’s light, and people are about in the daytime; but by night, then look out for misfortune.I advise you not to sleep at nights and to watch, watch with all your energies.You remember, in the garden, by night, at the fountain, that’s where there’s need to look out.You will thank me.’"
"马列夫斯基笑着转过身去了。他对我说的这番话不像是有什么大的意义；他有着爱故弄玄虚的名声，还因为在化妆舞会上戏弄别人而出名，他那几乎是下意识里的、渗透于他整个秉性之中的虚伪更是大大提高了他的这个名声……他只是想拿我取笑；但是他说的每个字都像是毒液一样流过我的血管。我的血直往头上涌。“啊！原来如此！”我心下想道，“好啊！无怪乎我总觉得想往花园里跑！那样的事绝不会发生！”我大声叫着，用拳头捶着胸口，尽管我自己都说不出绝不能让具体什么样的事发生。“管他是不是马列夫斯基自己去了花园呢，”我想着（他也许是吹嘘；但他无耻到能做出那样的事），“或者另有其人（我家花园的栅栏非常矮，跨过去毫不费力），不管怎么样，要是什么人落到我手里，他就要倒霉了！我奉劝谁也不要让我碰上！我要证明给全世界和她——这个负心女看（我竟用了“负心女”这个词），我会报仇的！”","Malevsky laughed and turned his back on me.He, most likely, attached no great importance to what he had said to me, he had a reputation for mystifying, and was noted for his power of taking people in at masquerades, which was greatly augmented by the almost unconscious falsity in which his whole nature was steeped....He only wanted to tease me; but every word he uttered was a poison that ran through my veins.The blood rushed to my head.‘Ah! so that’s it!’I said to myself; ‘good!So there was reason for me to feel drawn into the garden!That shan’t be so!’I cried aloud, and struck myself on the chest with my fist, though precisely what should not be so I could not have said.‘Whether Malevsky himself goes into the garden,’ I thought (he was bragging, perhaps; he has insolence enough for that), ‘or some one else (the fence of our garden was very low, and there was no difficulty in getting over it), anyway, if any one falls into my hands, it will be the worse for him!I don’t advise any one to meet me!I will prove to all the world and to her, the traitress (I actually used the word ‘traitress’) that I can be revenged!’"
"我回到自己的房间，从书桌里拿出来刚买的英国小刀，摸了摸锋利的刀刃，冷冷地皱了皱眉，下定了决心，然后把小刀装进口袋里，就好像做这样的事一点也不奇怪，并不是平生第一次一样。我满腔气愤，心如铁石。一整天我都生气地皱着眉头，咬紧嘴唇，不停地走来走去，手紧紧地握住口袋里已经被我握得发热的小刀，这时我已经提前做好了面对可怕的事的准备。这种全新的、莫名的感觉盘踞在我心里，甚至让我快活起来，结果是都很少去想齐娜依达本人了。年轻的茨冈人阿列科的故事一直萦绕在我心头——“你要去哪儿，漂亮的人儿？躺在这儿，”然后是，“你全身都是血迹…… 啊，你都干了些什么？……没什么！”我的脸上挂着残酷的微笑，重复着那句“没什么”！我的父亲不在家；可是近来好像一直在生闷气的母亲注意到我阴沉、要逞英雄的样子，晚饭时对我说：“你怎么气鼓鼓的，像只掉进米缸里的耗子？”我只是以迁就的一笑作为回答，暗暗想：“他们知道了才好呢！”时钟敲响了十一点；我回到房间，但是没有脱衣服；我在等待午夜的到来；最终午夜的钟声响了。“是时候了！”我从牙缝里挤出这句话；我把纽扣一直扣到领口，甚至把袖子挽了起来，然后去了花园。","I returned to my own room, took out of the writing-table an English knife I had recently bought, felt its sharp edge, and knitting my brows with an air of cold and concentrated determination, thrust it into my pocket, as though doing such deeds was nothing out of the way for me, and not the first time.My heart heaved angrily, and felt heavy as a stone.All day long I kept a scowling brow and lips tightly compressed, and was continually walking up and down, clutching, with my hand in my pocket, the knife, which was warm from my grasp, while I prepared myself beforehand for something terrible.These new unknown sensations so occupied and even delighted me, that I hardly thought of Zinaïda herself.I was continually haunted by Aleko, the young gipsy—‘Where art thou going, young handsome man?Lie there,’ and then, ‘thou art all besprent with blood.... Oh, what hast thou done?...Naught!’With what a cruel smile I repeated that ‘Naught!’My father was not at home; but my mother, who had for some time past been in an almost continual state of dumb exasperation, noticed my gloomy and heroic aspect, and said to me at supper, ‘Why are you sulking like a mouse in a meal-tub?’I merely smiled condescendingly in reply, and thought, ‘If only they knew!’It struck eleven; I went to my room, but did not undress; I waited for midnight; at last it struck.‘The time has come!’I muttered between my teeth; and buttoning myself up to the throat, and even pulling my sleeves up, I went into the garden."
"我早已选好地点，在那儿看守。在花园的尽头，在那道分隔我家和扎谢金家的栅栏和共用围墙相连的地方，孤零零地长着一棵松树。站在松树低矮、浓密的树枝下，在黑夜中目力所及的范围内，我可以清楚地看到周围所发生的一切。紧挨着有一条弯弯曲曲，我一直觉得神秘的小径；它像条蛇一样盘在栅栏底下，此处的栅栏显出有人爬过的痕迹，小路一直通向一个用厚实的合欢木盖成的圆形凉亭。我来到松树下，靠在树干上，开始守候起来。","I had already fixed on the spot from which to keep watch.At the end of the garden, at the point where the fence, separating our domain from the Zasyekins’， joined the common wall, grew a pine-tree, standing alone.Standing under its low thick branches, I could see well, as far as the darkness of the night permitted, what took place around.Close by, ran a winding path which had always seemed mysterious to me; it coiled like a snake under the fence, which at that point bore traces of having been climbed over, and led to a round arbour formed of thick acacias.I made my way to the pine-tree, leaned my back against its trunk, and began my watch."
"今夜如同前夜一样宁静，只是天空中的云少了些，树丛的轮廓，甚至那些高高的花朵，都显得更清楚可见。等待最开始的时候让人觉得压抑，简直有点吓人。我已经下定决心面对一切。我只想着怎样行动，是大喊：“你要去哪儿？站住！从实招来——否则死路一条！”或者是简单地索性刺过去……每一个声响，每一点沙沙声或瑟瑟声对我来说都很危险、不同寻常……我已经准备好了……我向前弯下腰……但是半个小时过去了，一个小时过去了；我的血冷却下来了；我开始悄悄地意识到，我所做的一切都是徒劳，我甚至有一点荒唐，马列夫斯基只是在捉弄我。我离开了埋伏的地方，然后在花园里四处逛了起来。周围连一丝毫声响也没有，就好像是对我的嘲讽一样；一切都静寂安宁。连我们家的狗都睡着了，在门前蜷成了一团。我爬到了废弃的暖房上，看着面前远方开阔的田野，想着我与齐娜依达的会面，于是陷入了幻想……","The night was as still as the night before, but there were fewer clouds in the sky, and the outlines of bushes, even of tall flowers, could be more distinctly seen.The first moments of expectation were oppressive, almost terrible.I had made up my mind to everything.I only debated how to act; whether to thunder, ‘Where goest thou?Stand! show thyself—or death!’ or simply to strike....Every sound, every whisper and rustle, seemed to me portentous and extraordinary....I prepared myself....I bent forward....But half-an-hour passed, an hour passed; my blood had grown quieter, colder; the consciousness that I was doing all this for nothing, that I was even a little absurd, that Malevsky had been making fun of me, began to steal over me.I left my ambush, and walked all about the garden.As if to taunt me, there was not the smallest sound to be heard anywhere; everything was at rest.Even our dog was asleep, curled up into a ball at the gate.I climbed up into the ruins of the greenhouse, saw the open country far away before me, recalled my meeting with Zinaïda, and fell to dreaming...."
"我被吓了一跳……我觉得我听到了开门的吱呀声，然后是隐约的枝条折断的声音。我两下子就从废弃的暖房上跳了下来，站住不动，惊呆了。花园里清晰地响起了急促、轻快但又警觉的脚步声。脚步离我越来越近了。“他来了……他来了，终于来了！”这念头在我心中闪过。我哆嗦着匆忙从兜里拿出了小刀，又哆嗦着匆忙打开了它。我眼前直冒金星；我既害怕又气愤，头发都立了起来……脚步直接冲着我过来了；我俯身——向前探着身子迎向他……一个男人出现在视线中……我的天呀！是我父亲！虽然他整个人都裹在了黑斗篷下，可我立刻就认出了他，而且他把帽子拉下来挡着他的脸。他踮着脚走过去了。虽然我没有藏起来，可他没有注意到我；我缩成一团，蜷在一起，我觉得我几乎是趴在地面上的。嫉妒的奥赛罗，准备好了大开杀戮，却突然间变成了小学生……一开始我被父亲出乎意料的出现吓坏了，都没有注意到他从哪儿来，又消失在哪个方向。当一切又静悄悄以后，我只是站起来，暗暗想，“为什么父亲在夜里还在花园走动呢？”我在恐惧中把小刀掉在草丛里了，可我甚至不试图去寻找它；我感到太羞愧了。我马上就完全清醒过来。在往回走的路上，我却走到那棵老树下坐下了，抬起头望着齐娜依达的窗子。微微凸起的狭小的窗玻璃在夜空昏暗的光线照射下泛着朦胧的蓝光。立刻——窗玻璃的颜色就开始变了……窗子后面——我看见，看得清清楚楚——白色的窗帘被小心翼翼地轻轻放了下来，一直落到窗台上，然后就那样一动不动了。","I started....I fancied I heard the creak of a door opening, then the faint crack of a broken twig.In two bounds I got down from the ruin, and stood still, all aghast.Rapid, light, but cautious footsteps sounded distinctly in the garden.They were approaching me.‘Here he is ... here he is, at last!’ flashed through my heart.With spasmodic haste, I pulled the knife out of my pocket; with spasmodic haste, I opened it.Flashes of red were whirling before my eyes; my hair stood up on my head in my fear and fury....The steps were coming straight towards me; I bent—I craned forward to meet him....A man came into view....My God!it was my father!I recognised him at once, though he was all muffled up in a dark cloak, and his hat was pulled down over his face.On tip-toe he walked by.He did not notice me, though nothing concealed me; but I was so huddled up and shrunk together that I fancy I was almost on the level of the ground.The jealous Othello, ready for murder, was suddenly transformed into a school-boy....I was so taken aback by my father’s unexpected appearance that for the first moment I did not notice where he had come from or in what direction he disappeared.I only drew myself up, and thought, ‘Why is it my father is walking about in the garden at night?’ when everything was still again.In my horror I had dropped my knife in the grass, but I did not even attempt to look for it; I was very much ashamed of myself.I was completely sobered at once.On my way to the house, however, I went up to my seat under the elder-tree, and looked up at Zinaïda’s window.The small slightly-convex panes of the window shone dimly blue in the faint light thrown on them by the night sky.All at once—their colour began to change....Behind them—I saw this, saw it distinctly—softly and cautiously a white blind was let down, let down right to the window-frame, and so stayed."
"“这是为什么？”当我又回到我的房间时，我几乎不由自主地大声说了出来。“是梦，是巧合，还是……”我的脑子里突然涌现出这些新奇的推测令我不敢想象。","‘What is that for?’I said aloud almost involuntarily when I found myself once more in my room.‘A dream, a chance, or ...’ The suppositions which suddenly rushed into my head were so new and strange that I did not dare to entertain them."
"第十八章","CHAPTER XVIII"
"早晨起床时我感觉头疼。我前一天的情绪已经消失了。取而代之的是空虚的沉闷感和一种从未有过的悲伤，好像我内心的什么东西已经死去了。","I got up in the morning with a headache.My emotion of the previous day had vanished.It was replaced by a dreary sense of blankness and a sort of sadness I had not known till then, as though something had died in me."
"“您怎么看上去像是个被人挖去半边脑子的兔子似的？”卢申见到我时问道。吃午饭的时候，我先是偷看了父亲一眼，然后又看看母亲：父亲像往常一样泰然自若；母亲也仍像往常一样暗暗地生气。我等着，看看父亲会不会像有时侯那样亲切地和我说说话……但是他连平常的冷冷的问候都没有对我说。“我是不是该告诉齐娜依达这一切呢？”我心想……“无论如何都一样；我们之间的一切都完了。”我去见了她，不但什么都没说，而且都没能如我所愿和她谈会儿话。老公爵夫人的儿子，十二岁的军校学生，从彼得堡来度假；齐娜依达立马就把她弟弟交给了我。“这儿，”她说道，“我亲爱的沃洛佳，”她头一次用这个昵称称呼我——“给您个伙伴。他的名字也是沃洛佳。希望您喜欢他；他还害羞，不过他可有副好心肠。带他去涅斯库奇花园，和他散散步，请您关照他。您会照顾他的，对吗？您的心地也是这么善良！”她亲切地把双手搭在我的肩膀上，我完全被弄糊涂了。这个小男孩的出现把我也变成了一个小男孩。我一言不发地看着这个军校学生，他也同样一言不发地盯着我看。齐娜依达笑了，把我们推到了一起。“互相拥抱吧，孩子们！”我们拥抱了一下。“您愿意让我带您去花园看看吗？”我问这个军校学生。“请吧。”他答道，声音沙哑，是地道的军校学生的声调。齐娜依达又大笑了……我这时及时注意到，她脸上从没有过这样洋溢着的光彩。我和军校学生动身了。我家的花园里有个老式的秋千。我让他坐在狭小的秋千木板上，然后开始推他荡起来了。他穿着一套小小的，有宽边金丝带装饰的崭新厚呢子军服，在秋千上正襟危坐，双手紧紧地握住绳子。“您还是把扣子解开吧。”我对他说。“没关系，我们都习惯了。”他答道，还清了清嗓子。他长得像他的姐姐。那双眼睛特别的像她姐姐，我愿意对他友好；可同时，一种让人痛楚的悲伤在折磨着我的内心。“现在我的确是个孩子了，”我想着，“可是还在昨天……”我想起了前一天晚上丢掉小刀的地方，就去找到了它。军校生向我讨去了小刀，捡了一根野欧芹的粗梗，削成一根笛子，开始吹了起来。我这个奥赛罗也吹了起来。","‘Why is it you’re looking like a rabbit with half its brain removed?’ said Lushin on meeting me.At lunch I stole a look first at my father, then at my mother: he was composed, as usual; she was, as usual, secretly irritated.I waited to see whether my father would make some friendly remarks to me, as he sometimes did....But he did not even bestow his everyday cold greeting upon me.‘Shall I tell Zinaïda all?’I wondered.... ‘It’s all the same, anyway; all is at an end between us.’I went to see her, but told her nothing, and, indeed, I could not even have managed to get a talk with her if I had wanted to.The old princess’s son, a cadet of twelve years old, had come from Petersburg for his holidays; Zinaïda at once handed her brother over to me.‘Here,’ she said, ‘my dear Volodya,’—it was the first time she had used this pet-name to me—‘is a companion for you.His name is Volodya, too.Please, like him; he is still shy, but he has a good heart.Show him Neskutchny gardens, go walks with him, take him under your protection.You’ll do that, won’t you?you’re so good, too!’She laid both her hands affectionately on my shoulders, and I was utterly bewildered.The presence of this boy transformed me, too, into a boy.I looked in silence at the cadet, who stared as silently at me.Zinaïda laughed, and pushed us towards each other.‘Embrace each other, children!’We embraced each other.‘Would you like me to show you the garden?’I inquired of the cadet.‘If you please,’ he replied, in the regular cadet’s hoarse voice.Zinaïda laughed again....I had time to notice that she had never had such an exquisite colour in her face before.I set off with the cadet.There was an old-fashioned swing in our garden.I sat him down on the narrow plank seat, and began swinging him.He sat rigid in his new little uniform of stout cloth, with its broad gold braiding, and kept tight hold of the cords.‘You’d better unbutton your collar,’ I said to him.‘It’s all right; we’re used to it,’ he said, and cleared his throat.He was like his sister.The eyes especially recalled her, I liked being nice to him; and at the same time an aching sadness was gnawing at my heart.‘Now I certainly am a child,’ I thought; ‘but yesterday....’I remembered where I had dropped my knife the night before, and looked for it.The cadet asked me for it, picked a thick stalk of wild parsley, cut a pipe out of it, and began whistling.Othello whistled too."
"但是傍晚，当齐娜依达在花园的角落里找到他这个奥赛罗时，他在齐娜依达的臂弯里哭得是那么伤心，她问他为什么这么沮丧。我泪如泉涌，把齐娜依达吓坏了。“您怎么了？怎么了，沃洛佳？”她一遍一遍地问；见我既不回答，也没停止哭泣，她开始亲吻我满是泪水的脸颊。但是我转过头去，呜咽着低声说：“我都知道了。您为什么要玩弄我呢？……您要我的爱情又有什么用呢？”","But in the evening how he wept, this Othello, in Zinaïda’s arms, when, seeking him out in a corner of the garden, she asked him why he was so depressed.My tears flowed with such violence that she was frightened.‘What is wrong with you?What is it, Volodya?’ she repeated; and seeing I made no answer, and did not cease weeping, she was about to kiss my wet cheek.But I turned away from her, and whispered through my sobs, ‘I know all. Why did you play with me?...What need had you of my love?’"
"“是我的错，沃洛佳……”齐娜依达说。“全都是我的错……”她又说道，绞着自己的双手。“我身上有很多糟糕、阴暗和罪恶的东西！……但是现在我没有在玩弄您。我爱您；您甚至不必怀疑为什么爱您或者怎样爱您……可是，您都知道些什么？”","‘I am to blame, Volodya ...’ said Zinaïda.‘I am very much to blame ...’ she added, wringing her hands.‘How much there is bad and black and sinful in me!...But I am not playing with you now.I love you; you don’t even suspect why and how....But what is it you know?’"
"我能对她说些什么呢？她面对着我站着，看着我；当她直直地看着我的时候，我从头到脚整个人都属于她了……一刻钟之后，我就和军校生还有齐娜依达赛跑起来了。我不哭了，我笑着，虽然当我笑的时候，我那哭肿了的眼皮里还会不时地掉下一两滴泪。我把齐娜依达的丝带系在脖子上当成领结，而且每当我成功地捉住她、抱住她的腰时，我就开心地大叫起来。她尽情地和我玩耍。","What could I say to her?She stood facing me, and looked at me; and I belonged to her altogether from head to foot directly she looked at me....A quarter of an hour later I was running races with the cadet and Zinaïda.I was not crying, I was laughing, though my swollen eyelids dropped a tear or two as I laughed.I had Zinaïda’s ribbon round my neck for a cravat, and I shouted with delight whenever I succeeded in catching her round the waist.She did just as she liked with me."
"第十九章","CHAPTER XIX"
"如果一定要我仔细地说出那次午夜探险失败后一周内我内心的变化，我会感到实在太难了。那是一段奇特的狂热时期，一种混乱的状态，那时候，种种最为截然相反的感情、想法、疑惑、希望、快乐和苦痛都像飓风一样卷动在一起。如果一个十六岁的少年可以探寻自己的内心的话，我很害怕探寻自己的内心；我害怕对任何事情追根究底；我只想尽快度过每一天，挨到傍晚；而在晚上，我就睡觉了……少年的无忧无虑帮了我的大忙。我不想知道是不是有人爱我，我也不想向自己承认没人爱我；我躲着我父亲——可是我却不能逃避齐娜依达……齐娜依达在的时候我像在火里燃烧一样……但我又何必在意我是身处在什么样的火中燃烧和熔化呢——燃烧和熔化也是甜蜜的事，这就够了。我任由自己沉浸在各种攸然来去的感情中，欺骗我自己，远离回忆，对预见到的即将到来的事也视而不见……无论如何这种软弱也不会持久……一声霹雳立刻就将一切都结束了，把我扔进了一条全新的轨道。","I should be in a great difficulty, if I were forced to describe exactly what passed within me in the course of the week after my unsuccessful midnight expedition.It was a strange feverish time, a sort of chaos, in which the most violently opposed feelings, thoughts, suspicions, hopes, joys, and sufferings, whirled together in a kind of hurricane.I was afraid to look into myself, if a boy of sixteen ever can look into himself; I was afraid to take stock of anything; I simply hastened to live through every day till evening; and at night I slept ... the light-heartedness of childhood came to my aid.I did not want to know whether I was loved, and I did not want to acknowledge to myself that I was not loved; my father I avoided—but Zinaïda I could not avoid....I burnt as in a fire in her presence ... but what did I care to know what the fire was in which I burned and melted—it was enough that it was sweet to burn and melt.I gave myself up to all my passing sensations, and cheated myself, turning away from memories, and shutting my eyes to what I foreboded before me....This weakness would not most likely have lasted long in any case ... a thunderbolt cut it all short in a moment, and flung me into a new track altogether."
"一天我散步很长时间后回家吃晚饭；我很惊讶地发现是我只能独自用餐，我父亲走了，母亲身体不舒服，一点也不想吃饭，而且还把自己关在卧室里。从仆人们的表情中，我猜出不同寻常的事情发生了……我不敢盘问他们，但是年轻的侍者菲利普是我的朋友，他狂热地喜爱诗歌，还会弹奏吉他。我同他攀谈起来。从他那里我得知，我父亲和母亲大吵了一架（在女仆的房间里能听到每个词；他们大都讲的是法语，但是女仆玛莎曾和一个巴黎的裁缝一起住了五年，她什么都听得懂）；我母亲责备父亲的不忠，说他和隔壁的一位年轻小姐过从甚密，起初父亲还为自己辩护，但是后来发了火，他也说了很残忍的“想想她的年龄”这样的话，这让我母亲哭了起来；母亲也提到了一些借款，好像是借给老公爵夫人了，还说了公爵夫人和公爵小姐的很不好的坏话，之后父亲就威胁起母亲来。“所有的吵闹,”菲利普接着说，“都是由一封匿名信引起的；没人知道是谁写的信，要不然这些事也不会给捅出来。”","Coming in one day to dinner from a rather long walk, I learnt with amazement that I was to dine alone, that my father had gone away and my mother was unwell, did not want any dinner, and had shut herself up in her bedroom.From the faces of the footmen, I surmised that something extraordinary had taken place....I did not dare to cross-examine them, but I had a friend in the young waiter Philip, who was passionately fond of poetry, and a performer on the guitar.I addressed myself to him.From him I learned that a terrible scene had taken place between my father and mother (and every word had been overheard in the maids’ room; much of it had been in French, but Masha the lady’s-maid had lived five years’ with a dressmaker from Paris, and she understood it all); that my mother had reproached my father with infidelity, with an intimacy with the young lady next door, that my father at first had defended himself, but afterwards had lost his temper, and he too had said something cruel, ‘reflecting on her age,’ which had made my mother cry; that my mother too had alluded to some loan which it seemed had been made to the old princess, and had spoken very ill of her and of the young lady too, and that then my father had threatened her.‘And all the mischief,’ continued Philip, ‘came from an anonymous letter; and who wrote it, no one knows, or else there’d have been no reason whatever for the matter to have come out at all.’"
"“但是难道真有这事。”我好不容易说出这句话，手脚都变得冰冷，内心深处一阵战栗。","‘But was there really any ground,’ I brought out with difficulty, while my hands and feet went cold, and a sort of shudder ran through my inmost being."
"菲利普意味深长地眨眨眼。“真有。那些事情藏不住的；尽管您父亲这次很小心了——但是您看，比方说他要雇辆马车或者别的什么事情……没有仆人也不行啊。”","Philip winked meaningly.‘There was.There’s no hiding those things; for all that your father was careful this time—but there, you see, he’d, for instance, to hire a carriage or something ... no getting on without servants, either.’"
"我打发走了菲利普，躺到自己的床上。我没有哭泣，我没有让绝望打倒我；我没问自己这件事是什么时候、怎么发生的；我也没有奇怪我怎么没有之前、很久以前就猜出来；我甚至没有责备父亲……我所了解的事情超出了我所能接受的范围；突然的真相让我惊呆了……一切都完了。我心中所有美好的花朵全被粗暴地拔断了，被丢在我身边，被扔在地上，被践踏在脚下。","I dismissed Philip, and fell on to my bed.I did not sob, I did not give myself up to despair; I did not ask myself when and how this had happened; I did not wonder how it was I had not guessed it before, long ago; I did not even upbraid my father....What I had learnt was more than I could take in; this sudden revelation stunned me....All was at an end.All the fair blossoms of my heart were roughly plucked at once, and lay about me, flung on the ground, and trampled underfoot."
"第二十章","CHAPTER XX"
"第二天，母亲宣布了她要回到城里的打算。早晨，父亲去了她的卧室，在那儿单独陪了她很长时间。没人能听到他都对她说了些什么；但是母亲不再哭了；她恢复了平静，要了点吃的，但是没有出房间，也没有改变主意。我记得，那一整天我都四处转悠，但是我没有去花园，也没有再看小厢房一眼；傍晚的时候我看到了惊人的一幕：我父亲抓住马列夫斯基伯爵的胳膊，穿过饭厅把他拖进前厅，当着位仆人的面冷冷地对他说：“几天前，在我家就对您下过逐客令；现在我不打算对您做任何解释，不过我有幸通知您，如果您再来拜访我这儿的话，我就会把您从窗户扔出去。我不喜欢您的笔迹。”伯爵低下头，咬着嘴唇，缩着身子走了。","My mother next day announced her intention of returning to the town.In the morning my father had gone into her bedroom, and stayed there a long while alone with her.No one had overheard what he said to her; but my mother wept no more; she regained her composure, and asked for food, but did not make her appearance nor change her plans.I remember I wandered about the whole day, but did not go into the garden, and never once glanced at the lodge, and in the evening I was the spectator of an amazing occurrence: my father conducted Count Malevsky by the arm through the dining-room into the hall, and, in the presence of a footman, said icily to him: ‘A few days ago your excellency was shown the door in our house; and now I am not going to enter into any kind of explanation with you, but I have the honour to announce to you that if you ever visit me again, I shall throw you out of window.I don’t like your handwriting.’The count bowed, bit his lips, shrank away, and vanished."
"家里开始收拾行装，准备回到城里阿尔伯特大街去，我们的房子在那儿。我父亲本人可能也不想留在乡下别墅里了；不过显然他劝服了母亲不要把事情张扬出去。一切都安安静静、徐徐地进行着；母亲甚至派人给公爵夫人送去问候并表达了遗憾：因为身体欠安，不能在离开前再见她一面了。我像发疯了一样走来走去，只有一个愿望，希望这一切都尽快结束。我脑中始终不能摆脱一个念头：她，一个年轻小姐，而且还是个公爵小姐，明知道我父亲是个有家室的人，而且她有机会嫁给，比方说，别洛夫佐罗夫，怎么能让自己走到这个地步呢？她想要什么？她怎么就不怕毁掉她的整个前程呢？我想，是呀，这就是爱情，这就是激情，这就是奉献……我又想起了卢申的话：为了一些人牺牲自我也是件甜蜜的事。偶然间，不知怎地，我看见了小厢房的一扇窗子后有一个白色的影子……“那会是齐娜依达的脸吗？”我想……是的，那真的是齐娜依达的脸。我控制不住自己。我不能连最后一声再见也不说就和她分别。我找个适宜的时候，去了小厢房。","Preparations were beginning for our removal to town, to Arbaty Street, where we had a house.My father himself probably no longer cared to remain at the country house; but clearly he had succeeded in persuading my mother not to make a public scandal.Everything was done quietly, without hurry; my mother even sent her compliments to the old princess, and expressed her regret that she was prevented by indisposition from seeing her again before her departure.I wandered about like one possessed, and only longed for one thing, for it all to be over as soon as possible.One thought I could not get out of my head: how could she, a young girl, and a princess too, after all, bring herself to such a step, knowing that my father was not a free man, and having an opportunity of marrying, for instance, Byelovzorov?What did she hope for?How was it she was not afraid of ruining her whole future?Yes, I thought, this is love, this is passion, this is devotion ... and Lushin’s words came back to me: to sacrifice oneself for some people is sweet.I chanced somehow to catch sight of something white in one of the windows of the lodge....‘Can it be Zinaïda’s face?’I thought ... yes, it really was her face.I could not restrain myself.I could not part from her without saying a last good-bye to her.I seized a favourable instant, and went into the lodge."
"老公爵夫人在客厅见了我，像往常一样马马虎虎、随随便便地问候了我。","In the drawing-room the old princess met me with her usual slovenly and careless greetings."
"“我的好孩子，你们怎么这样急着离开呢？”她说着，把鼻烟往鼻子里塞。我看着她，心里的包袱放下了。菲利普说出的“借款”这个词一直让我苦恼不堪。她一点儿也没怀疑……至少那时我是这么想。齐娜依达从隔壁房间走进来，面色苍白，身穿黑色的衣服，头发松松地垂下；她一句话也没说，拉着我的手带着我离开。","‘How’s this, my good man, your folks are off in such a hurry?’ she observed, thrusting snuff into her nose.I looked at her, and a load was taken off my heart.The word ‘loan,’ dropped by Philip, had been torturing me.She had no suspicion ... at least I thought so then.Zinaïda came in from the next room, pale, and dressed in black, with her hair hanging loose; she took me by the hand without a word, and drew me away with her."
"“我一听到您的声音，”她说，“就马上出来了。对您来说离开我们就是这么容易吗，坏孩子？”","‘I heard your voice,’ she began, ‘and came out at once.Is it so easy for you to leave us, bad boy?’"
"“我来向您说再见，公爵小姐，”我答道，“也许是永别。也许您已经听说，我们要走了。”","‘I have come to say good-bye to you, princess,’ I answered, ‘probably for ever.You have heard, perhaps, we are going away.’"
"齐娜依达凝神看着我。","Zinaïda looked intently at me."
"“是的，我已经听说了。谢谢您过来。开始我还想，我再也见不到您了呢。忘了我不好的事情吧。有时候我折磨过您，但尽管如此，我不是您想象中那样的人。”她转过身去，靠着窗户。","‘Yes, I have heard.Thanks for coming.I was beginning to think I should not see you again.Don’t remember evil against me.I have sometimes tormented you, but all the same I am not what you imagine me.’She turned away, and leaned against the window."
"“是真的，我不是那样的人。我知道您对我的印象不好。”","‘Really, I am not like that.I know you have a bad opinion of me.’"
"“我？”","‘I?’"
"“是的，您……您。”","‘Yes, you ... you.’"
"“我？”我伤心地重复着，我的心在她那让人无法抗拒、无法形容的魅力的影响下又像往日那样搏动起来了。“我？相信我，齐娜依达·亚历山德罗夫娜，不管您做了什么，无论您曾经怎么折磨过我，我都会爱您、敬慕您，直到我生命的最后一刻。”","‘I?’ I repeated mournfully, and my heart throbbed as of old under the influence of her overpowering, indescribable fascination.‘I? Believe me, Zinaïda Alexandrovna, whatever you did, however you tormented me, I should love and adore you to the end of my days.’"
"她飞快地向我转过身，大大地张开双臂，抱住我的头，给了我一个温暖、动情的吻。天知道那个长长的吻别是送给谁的，但是我如饥似渴地尝着它的甜蜜。我知道这样的吻不会再有了。“再见，再见。”我一直说着……","She turned with a rapid motion to me, and flinging wide her arms, embraced my head, and gave me a warm and passionate kiss.God knows whom that long farewell kiss was seeking, but I eagerly tasted its sweetness.I knew that it would never be repeated.‘Good-bye, good-bye,’ I kept saying ..."
"她依依不舍地离开，出去了。我也离开了。我无法描述我是带着什么样的心情离开的。我不希望这种感情再出现；但是如果我从没有体验过这样的感情的话，我会觉得自己是非常不幸的。","She tore herself away, and went out.And I went away.I cannot describe the emotion with which I went away.I should not wish it ever to come again; but I should think myself unfortunate had I never experienced such an emotion."
"我们回到城里去了。我没有很快地摆脱往事；我没有马上投入到学习中。我的伤口开始慢慢地愈合；但是我对父亲并没有厌恶感。正相反，父亲好像在我心里更高大了……就让心理学家尽力解释这种矛盾吧。一天，我正沿着林阴路漫步，遇到了卢申，真是让我说不出地高兴。我喜欢他，因为他有耿直、真诚的性格，除此之外，他还唤起了我心中的回忆，让我觉得他很亲切。我快速跑向他。“哎呀！”他说着，皱了皱眉头，“是您呀，年轻人。让我看看您。您还是像往常一样蜡黄，但是您眼里已经没有之前那种糊涂样儿了。您看起来像个男人了，不像个叭儿狗了。这就好。恩，您在忙什么呢？学习吗？”","We went back to town.I did not quickly shake off the past; I did not quickly get to work.My wound slowly began to heal; but I had no ill-feeling against my father.On the contrary he had, as it were, gained in my eyes ... let psychologists explain the contradiction as best they can.One day I was walking along a boulevard, and to my indescribable delight, I came across Lushin.I liked him for his straightforward and unaffected character, and besides he was dear to me for the sake of the memories he aroused in me.I rushed up to him.‘Aha!’ he said, knitting his brows,‘ so it’s you, young man.Let me have a look at you.You’re still as yellow as ever, but yet there’s not the same nonsense in your eyes.You look like a man, not a lap-dog.That’s good.Well, what are you doing?working?’"
"我叹了口气。我不喜欢撒谎，可是说实话我又觉得难为情。","I gave a sigh.I did not like to tell a lie, while I was ashamed to tell the truth."
"“恩，没关系，”卢申继续说道，“别害羞。重要的是过正常的生活，而不被激情所支配。不然的话，您又能得到什么？无论您被波浪冲到哪儿——都是一样的糟糕；一个男人一定要站稳脚跟，哪怕他什么也没有，只有一方石头也要站住。看，我得咳嗽一下……别洛夫佐罗夫——您听说过他的什么事吗？”","‘Well, never mind,’ Lushin went on, ‘don’t be shy.The great thing is to lead a normal life, and not be the slave of your passions.What do you get if not?Wherever you are carried by the tide—it’s all a bad look-out; a man must stand on his own feet, if he can get nothing but a rock to stand on.Here, I’ve got a cough ... and Byelovzorov—have you heard anything of him?’"
"“没有。怎么了？”","‘No.What is it?’"
"“他失踪了，没有任何消息；有人说他到高加索去了。对您是个教训，年轻人。这都是因为不知道如何及时分手，如何冲破罗网。您好像已经顺利走出来了。要小心不要再掉入同样的陷阱里了。再见。”","‘He’s lost, and no news of him; they say he’s gone away to the Caucasus.A lesson to you, young man.And it’s all from not knowing how to part in time, to break out of the net.You seem to have got off very well.Mind you don’t fall into the same snare again.Good-bye.’"
"“我不会，”我寻思着……“我不会再见到她了。”但是，我注定还要见齐娜依达一面。","‘I shan’t,’ I thought....‘I shan’t see her again.’But I was destined to see Zinaïda once more."
"第二十一章","CHAPTER XXI"
"我父亲每天都骑马外出。他有一匹极棒的英国母马，栗色花斑，脖子修长，四腿也长，是一匹耐力极佳的烈性马。它的名字叫“闪电”。除了我父亲，谁也骑不了它。一天，父亲来到我跟前，脾气很好，我很久都没见到他心情这么好了；他准备好骑马出去，连马刺都戴上了。我开始央求父亲把我也带上。","My father used every day to ride out on horse-back.He had a splendid English mare, a chestnut piebald, with a long slender neck and long legs, an inexhaustible and vicious beast.Her name was Electric.No one could ride her except my father.One day he came up to me in a good humour, a frame of mind in which I had not seen him for a long while; he was getting ready for his ride, and had already put on his spurs.I began entreating him to take me with him."
"“我们还不如玩跳蛙游戏，”父亲答道，“你骑那匹矮脚马永远也赶不上我。”","‘We’d much better have a game of leap-frog,’ my father replied.‘You’ll never keep up with me on your cob.’"
"“会的，我会的；我也戴上马刺。”","‘Yes, I will; I’ll put on spurs too.’"
"“好吧，那就一起来吧。”","‘All right, come along then.’"
"我们出发了。我的马长着黑色长毛，强壮有力，精神头十足。当闪电快步疾行时，它就得全力奔跑，然而我总算没有落后。我从没有见过任何人像我父亲那样骑马；他在马上显得那么从容、潇洒，就好像他胯下的马也察觉到这一点，也以它的骑手为荣。我们骑过所有的林阴路，来到了“处女地”，跳过几道栅栏（起初我不敢跳，可是父亲瞧不起懦夫，很快我就不胆怯了），两次横过莫斯科河，我以为我们就要回家了，特别是父亲他自己也察觉到我的马累了，可父亲突然掉头抛开我，转向克里木浅滩，沿着河岸策马飞奔。我紧追在后面。当他来到一处摞得高高的旧原木堆时，轻快地从闪电上滑下来，叫我也下马，把他的马的缰绳给我，叫我就在木堆这儿等着他，他然后转身进了一条小巷子，消失不见了。我开始沿着河岸来回走，牵着马，还训斥着闪电，因为它一边走，还一边挣扎，摇头晃脑，打着鼻响，嘶鸣不止；每当我站住的时候，它都得用蹄子刨地，嘶叫着，还咬我的马的脖子；实际上，它处处显示自己是一匹被惯坏了的纯种马。父亲还没有回来。河边飘起一阵令人难受的潮气；天空开始下起了绵绵细雨，雨点落在那堆令人讨厌的灰色木堆上，留下斑驳的小黑点，我一直在木堆旁边走来走去，此时心里已经烦透了。我烦闷到极点，可父亲还没有回来。这时来了一个芬兰佬，看似是个巡警，穿着一身木头色的灰色衣服，头戴一顶大大的、像罐子似的旧式筒帽，手里拿着一把戟（你就想想，莫斯科河岸上怎么会有巡警！），他把那张像老太婆似的、长满皱纹的脸转向我，说道，“您牵着马在这儿做什么，少爷？","We set off.I had a shaggy black horse, strong, and fairly spirited.It is true it had to gallop its utmost, when Electric went at full trot, still I was not left behind.I have never seen any one ride like my father; he had such a fine carelessly easy seat, that it seemed that the horse under him was conscious of it, and proud of its rider.We rode through all the boulevards, reached the ‘Maidens’ Field', jumped several fences (at first I had been afraid to take a leap, but my father had a contempt for cowards, and I soon ceased to feel fear), twice crossed the river Moskva, and I was under the impression that we were on our way home, especially as my father of his own accord observed that my horse was tired, when suddenly he turned off away from me at the Crimean ford, and galloped along the river-bank.I rode after him.When he had reached a high stack of old timber, he slid quickly off Electric, told me to dismount, and giving me his horse’s bridle, told me to wait for him there at the timber-stack, and, turning off into a small street, disappeared.I began walking up and down the river-bank, leading the horses, and scolding Electric, who kept pulling, shaking her head, snorting and neighing as she went; and when I stood still, never failed to paw the ground, and whining, bite my cob on the neck; in fact she conducted herself altogether like a spoilt thorough-bred.My father did not come back.A disagreeable damp mist rose from the river; a fine rain began softly blowing up, and spotting with tiny dark flecks the stupid grey timber-stack, which I kept passing and repassing, and was deadly sick of by now.I was terribly bored, and still my father did not come.A sort of sentry-man, a Fin, grey all over like the timber, and with a huge old-fashioned shako, like a pot, on his head, and with a halberd (and how ever came a sentry, if you think of it, on the banks of the Moskva!) drew near, and turning his wrinkled face, like an old woman’s, towards me, he observed,‘What are you doing here with the horses, young master?"
"让我来牵着它们吧。”","Let me hold them.’"
"我没有搭理他。他又向我讨烟。为了摆脱他（我也因为不耐烦而焦躁不安），我朝父亲消失的方向走了几步，沿着小巷走到了底，转过街角，就站住不动了。离我约有四十步远的街上有座木屋，窗子敞开着，父亲就站在那儿，背对着我，他身子向前靠着窗台；屋子里坐着个身穿深色裙子的女人，她的半个身子被窗帘遮住，正和我父亲谈话；那个女人就是齐娜依达。","I made him no reply.He asked me for tobacco.To get rid of him (I was in a fret of impatience, too), I took a few steps in the direction in which my father had disappeared, then walked along the little street to the end, turned the corner, and stood still.In the street, forty paces from me, at the open window of a little wooden house, stood my father, his back turned to me; he was leaning forward over the window-sill, and in the house, half hidden by a curtain, sat a woman in a dark dress talking to my father; this woman was Zinaïda."
"我惊呆了。我承认，这是我万万没有料到的。我的第一反应是跑开。“父亲会四处看的，”我暗想，“那我就完了……”但是一种奇怪的感觉——一种比好奇更强烈，比嫉妒更强烈，甚至超过了恐惧的感觉——让我留在原地。我开始定睛看着；仔细地侧耳倾听。看起来像是我父亲坚持要做什么。齐娜依达不同意。此时我好像看到了她的脸——那么悲伤、严肃、可爱，有一种无法形容的虔诚、忧伤和爱恋的样子，还有某种绝望的表情——我找不出别的词来形容了。她说的话都是简短的单音节字，也不抬起眼睛，只是笑着——顺从地笑着，但是没有屈服。但是单单凭那微笑，我就认出了往日的齐娜依达了。我父亲耸耸肩，拉了拉头上的帽子，这样的动作总是父亲不耐烦的表现……接着，我听到了这些话：“您应该离开这个……”齐娜依达站了起来，伸出双臂……突然间，就在我的眼前，不可思议的事情发生了。父亲突然扬起了他用来拂打外套上灰尘的鞭子，接着我听到一声刺耳的鞭响，鞭子抽在她的胳膊上，就抽在那裸露的臂肘上。我几乎不能控制自己，差点叫出声来；齐娜依达颤抖了一下，一言不发地看着我父亲，慢慢地把胳膊举到唇边，亲吻胳膊上红色的鞭痕。父亲将鞭子甩到一边，匆匆地登上台阶，冲进屋子里去了……齐娜依达转过身，伸开双臂，垂着头，也离开了窗子。","I was petrified.This, I confess, I had never expected.My first impulse was to run away.‘My father will look round,’ I thought, ‘and I am lost ...’ but a strange feeling—a feeling stronger than curiosity, stronger than jealousy, stronger even than fear—held me there.I began to watch; I strained my ears to listen.It seemed as though my father were insisting on something.Zinaïda would not consent.I seem to see her face now—mournful, serious, lovely, and with an inexpressible impress of devotion, grief, love, and a sort of despair—I can find no other word for it.She uttered monosyllables, not raising her eyes, simply smiling—submissively, but without yielding.By that smile alone, I should have known my Zinaïda of old days.My father shrugged his shoulders, and straightened his hat on his head, which was always a sign of impatience with him....Then I caught the words: ‘Vous devez vous séparer de cette...’Zinaïda sat up, and stretched out her arm....Suddenly, before my very eyes, the impossible happened.My father suddenly lifted the whip, with which he had been switching the dust off his coat, and I heard a sharp blow on that arm, bare to the elbow.I could scarcely restrain myself from crying out; while Zinaïda shuddered, looked without a word at my father, and slowly raising her arm to her lips, kissed the streak of red upon it.My father flung away the whip, and running quickly up the steps, dashed into the house....Zinaïda turned round, and with outstretched arms and downcast head, she too moved away from the window."
"我吓得心里缩成一团，怀着一种畏惧的惶恐跑了回去，一直跑过小巷，回到河岸边，险些放跑了闪电。我什么也想不明白。我知道我那冷漠少言的父亲会时不时地突然大发雷霆；尽管如此，我始终无法理解刚刚见到的景象……但是那时我觉得，无论我活多久，我永远都不会忘记齐娜依达的姿态，她的目光，她的微笑；她的样子，她突然呈现在我面前的样子，永远地烙刻在了我的记忆当中。我茫然地望着河面，不知不觉地流下了眼泪。“她挨打了，”我心想着，……“挨打了……挨打了……”","My heart sinking with panic, with a sort of awe-struck horror, I rushed back, and running down the lane, almost letting go my hold of Electric, went back to the bank of the river.I could not think clearly of anything.I knew that my cold and reserved father was sometimes seized by fits of fury; and all the same, I could never comprehend what I had just seen....But I felt at the time that, however long I lived, I could never forget the gesture, the glance, the smile, of Zinaïda; that her image, this image so suddenly presented to me, was imprinted for ever on my memory.I stared vacantly at the river, and never noticed that my tears were streaming.‘She is beaten,’ I was thinking,... ‘beaten ... beaten....’"
"“喂！你在做什么呢？把马给我！”我听见身后父亲的声音。","‘Hullo!what are you doing?Give me the mare!’I heard my father’s voice saying behind me."
"我木木地把缰绳交给他。他一跃跳上闪电……这匹站着受冻了的马一下用后蹄站了起来，向前跃了有一丈远……可是父亲很快就制服了它；父亲用马刺踢了它的两肋，还用拳头给了它脖子一下子……“啊，鞭子没了。”他嘟囔着。","Mechanically I gave him the bridle.He leaped on to Electric ... the mare, chill with standing, reared on her haunches, and leaped ten feet away ... but my father soon subdued her; he drove the spurs into her sides, and gave her a blow on the neck with his fist....‘Ah, I’ve no whip,’ he muttered."
"我想起来恰恰刚才鞭子的呼哨和掉落，哆嗦了一下。","I remembered the swish and fall of the whip, heard so short a time before, and shuddered."
"“您把它放在哪儿了？”顿了一下后，我问父亲。","‘Where did you put it?’I asked my father, after a brief pause."
"父亲没有回答，只策马向前跑。我追上他。我想我一定要看看他的脸色。","My father made no answer, and galloped on ahead.I overtook him.I felt that I must see his face."
"“你等我等得不耐烦了吗？”父亲从双齿间挤出这句话。","‘Were you bored waiting for me?’ he muttered through his teeth."
"“有点。您把鞭子丢在哪儿了？”我又问了一遍。","‘A little.Where did you drop your whip?’I asked again."
"父亲飞快地扫了我一眼。“我没有丢掉鞭子，”父亲答道，“我把它给扔了。”他陷入了沉思，垂下了头……接着，是第一次，也几乎是最后一次，我看见父亲那坚毅的脸庞上所能表现出的这般柔情和惋惜。","My father glanced quickly at me.‘I didn’t drop it,’ he replied; ‘I threw it away.’He sank into thought, and dropped his head ... and then, for the first, and almost for the last time, I saw how much tenderness and pity his stern features were capable of expressing."
"他又策马飞奔，这一次我没能追上他；我比父亲晚了一刻钟才到家。","He galloped on again, and this time I could not overtake him; I got home a quarter-of-an-hour after him."
"“那就是爱情，”晚上，我坐在已经渐渐摆上书本和纸张的书桌前，又自言自语起来，“那就是激情！……想想能不反抗，去忍受随便什么人的鞭打……甚至是来自最亲爱的人之手！但是似乎如果一个人爱着对方……那就可以，可是我……我想……“","‘That’s love,’ I said to myself again, as I sat at night before my writing-table, on which books and papers had begun to make their appearance; ‘that’s passion!...To think of not revolting, of bearing a blow from any one whatever ... even the dearest hand!But it seems one can, if one loves.... While I ... I imagined ...’"
"近来一个月了我变得老成了许多；我的爱情，我那伴随着狂喜与痛苦的爱情与另一种无法想象的感情相比，显得是那样渺小、幼稚、可怜，但是我还没能完全弄懂这种无法想象的感情，它让我感到恐惧，就如同一张在半明半暗中浮现出的陌生、美丽而又恶毒的面孔，你竭力要把它辨认清楚，但却无能为力……","I had grown much older during the last month; and my love, with all its transports and sufferings, struck me myself as something small and childish and pitiful beside this other unimagined something, which I could hardly fully grasp, and which frightened me like an unknown, beautiful, but menacing face, which one strives in vain to make out clearly in the half-darkness...."
"当天夜里，我做了个奇怪而又可怕的梦。我梦见我走进一间低矮昏暗的屋子……我父亲手里拿着鞭子站着，生气地跺脚；齐娜依达缩在角落里，她的额头而不是手臂上，有一条红色的鞭痕……而在他们身后站着高高的别洛夫佐罗夫，他满身血迹，张着苍白的嘴唇，怒不可遏地恐吓着我的父亲。","A strange and fearful dream came to me that same night.I dreamed I went into a low dark room....My father was standing with a whip in his hand, stamping with anger; in the corner crouched Zinaïda, and not on her arm, but on her forehead, was a stripe of red ... while behind them both towered Byelovzorov, covered with blood; he opened his white lips, and wrathfully threatened my father."
"两个月后，我上了大学；六个月后父亲因为中风在彼得堡去世，而他带着母亲和我刚搬到那儿不久。在他离世的几天前，他收到一封来自莫斯科的信，这封信让他狂躁不安……他找我母亲请求她帮忙，而且，我听说，他居然还流下眼泪——他，我的父亲！就在他中风的那天早上，他用法语给我给我写了一封信，只开了个头。“我的儿子，”他写道，“要当心女人的爱情；当心那幸福，那毒药……”父亲去世后，母亲往莫斯科寄了一笔钱，数量相当可观。","Two months later, I entered the university; and within six months my father died of a stroke in Petersburg, where he had just moved with my mother and me.A few days before his death he received a letter from Moscow which threw him into a violent agitation....He went to my mother to beg some favour of her: and, I was told, he positively shed tears—he, my father!On the very morning of the day when he was stricken down, he had begun a letter to me in French.‘My son,’ he wrote to me, ‘fear the love of woman; fear that bliss, that poison....’After his death, my mother sent a considerable sum of money to Moscow."
"第二十二章","CHAPTER XXII"
"四年过去了。我刚刚大学毕业，还不清楚自己要做什么，谋什么职位；那段时间里我都赋闲无事。一个天气不错的傍晚，我在剧院见到了马伊达诺夫。他结婚了，在政府部门供职；可我发现他一点儿也没有变。他像从前一样无端地过于兴高采烈，接着又突然变得沮丧起来。","Four years passed.I had just left the university, and did not know exactly what to do with myself, at what door to knock; I was hanging about for a time with nothing to do.One fine evening I met Meidanov at the theatre.He had got married, and had entered the civil service; but I found no change in him.He fell into ecstasies in just the same superfluous way, and just as suddenly grew depressed again."
"“您知道吗，”他还对我说，“多尔斯基夫人在这里。”","‘You know,’ he told me among other things, ‘Madame Dolsky’s here.’"
"“哪位多尔斯基夫人？”","‘What Madame Dolsky?’"
"“您难道能忘了她吗？——扎谢金公爵小姐，我们都爱过她的，您也是。您还记得涅斯库奇花园附近的那座乡村别墅吗？”","‘Can you have forgotten her?—the young Princess Zasyekin whom we were all in love with, and you too.Do you remember at the country-house near Neskutchny gardens?’"
"“她嫁给了某位多尔斯基？”","‘She married a Dolsky?’"
"“是啊。”","‘Yes.’"
"“而且她就在这里，在剧院里吗？”","‘And is she here, in the theatre?’"
"“不，但是她在彼得堡。她几天前来到这里的。她要出国了。”","‘No: but she’s in Petersburg.She came here a few days ago.She’s going abroad.’"
"“她丈夫是个什么样的人？”我问。","‘What sort of fellow is her husband?’I asked."
"“一个不错的家伙，很有钱。他是我在莫斯科的一个同事。您一定非常理解——那场风波之后……您一定都知道得一清二楚了……”（马伊达诺夫意味深长地笑着）“她要再给自己找一桩称心如意的婚姻可不容易了；总还是有后果的……不过凭着她的聪明才智倒也万事容易。去看看她吧；她见到您会非常高兴的。她比从前更漂亮了。”","‘A splendid fellow, with property.He’s a colleague of mine in Moscow.You can well understand—after the scandal ... you must know all about it ...’ (Meidanov smiled significantly) ‘it was no easy task for her to make a good marriage; there were consequences ... but with her cleverness, everything is possible.Go and see her; she’ll be delighted to see you.She’s prettier than ever.’"
"马伊达诺夫把齐娜依达的地址给了我。她住在德穆特酒店。昔日的记忆在我心头骚动起来……我决定第二天去看看我旧日的“情人”。但是碰巧我遇到了些事情；一周过去了，接着又是一周，而当我最终去德穆特酒店找多尔斯基夫人时，我听说四天前她死了，因为难产几乎是突然死去的。","Meidanov gave me Zinaïda’s address.She was staying at the Hotel Demut.Old memories were astir within me....I determined next day to go to see my former ‘flame.’But some business happened to turn up; a week passed, and then another, and when at last I went to the Hotel Demut and asked for Madame Dolsky, I learnt that four days before, she had died, almost suddenly, in childbirth."
"我觉得心里像被刺了一刀似的。一想到我本能见到她的，却没有见到，也永远见不到她了——这种痛苦的念头强烈地谴责着我，刺激着我。“她死了！”我重复着，傻傻地盯着大厅看门人看。我慢慢地走到街上，漫无目的地信步走着。重重往事一下子忽地全都涌上心头。这就是结局，这就是那个年轻、热情、灿烂的生命匆匆忙忙而又焦躁不安地所追求的归宿！我想着这事；我想象着她那亲切的容貌，她那双眼睛，她那卷发——都在潮湿、黑暗的地下的一个狭小的匣子里——而我还活着——埋在那儿，离我没多远，而且也许离我父亲只有几步远……我想着这一切；我竭力想象着，可始终都是这两句：","I felt a sort of stab at my heart.The thought that I might have seen her, and had not seen her, and should never see her—that bitter thought stung me with all the force of overwhelming reproach.‘She is dead!’I repeated, staring stupidly at the hall-porter.I slowly made my way back to the street, and walked on without knowing myself where I was going.All the past swam up and rose at once before me.So this was the solution, this was the goal to which that young, ardent, brilliant life had striven, all haste and agitation!I mused on this; I fancied those dear features, those eyes, those curls—in the narrow box, in the damp underground darkness—lying here, not far from me—while I was still alive, and, maybe, a few paces from my father.... I thought all this; I strained my imagination, and yet all the while the lines:"
"“我从冷漠的唇中听到她的死讯，","‘From lips indifferent of her death I heard,"
"我也冷漠地听着。”","Indifferently I listened to it, too,’"
"诗句在我的心中回荡着。哦，青春，青春！你什么都不在乎；你就是主宰，可以说你主宰着宇宙中的一切珍宝——就连不幸都能给你以欢乐，你甚至能把忧伤转为己用；你充满自信，傲慢自负；你说：“只有我活着——你看！”———然而同时，时光飞逝，消失得无影无踪；而你的一切也会消失，就像阳光下的蜡，像那积雪……也许，你那魅力的所有秘密不在于你可以做任何事，而是在于你认为你能做任何事；在于你将你的精力挥霍于风中，而没有将它用于别处；在于我们每个人都严肃地认为自己是个回头的浪子，都严肃地认为自己有权利说：“哦，如果我没有浪费时间，我一定大有作为！”","were echoing in my heart.O youth, youth!little dost thou care for anything; thou art master, as it were, of all the treasures of the universe—even sorrow gives thee pleasure, even grief thou canst turn to thy profit; thou art self-confident and insolent; thou sayest, ‘I alone am living—look you!’—but thy days fly by all the while, and vanish without trace or reckoning; and everything in thee vanishes, like wax in the sun, like snow....And, perhaps, the whole secret of thy charm lies, not in being able to do anything, but in being able to think thou wilt do anything; lies just in thy throwing to the winds, forces which thou couldst not make other use of; in each of us gravely regarding himself as a prodigal, gravely supposing that he is justified in saying, ‘Oh, what might I not have done if I had not wasted my time!’"
"而现在的我……当我的初恋如幻象般昙花一现，只唤起一声叹息或一阵悲伤的情感时，我希望过什么，期待过什么，预见过什么样的光辉灿烂的前程呢？","I, now ... what did I hope for, what did I expect, what rich future did I foresee, when the phantom of my first love, rising up for an instant, barely called forth one sigh, one mournful sentiment?"
"而我所希望的事情又有什么实现了呢？现在，当黄昏的阴影开始渐渐笼罩我的生命时，对我来说，又有什么比对春日早晨那迅速消逝的雷雨的记忆更令人感到清新、可贵呢？","And what has come to pass of all I hoped for?And now, when the shades of evening begin to steal over my life, what have I left fresher, more precious, than the memories of the storm—so soon over—of early morning, of spring?"
"不过我对自己太不公正了。即便在那时，在那些无忧无虑年轻的日子里，当悲伤的声音传入我的耳朵时，当我听到坟墓上方飘来庄重的旋律时，我也不是无动于衷的。我记得，当我听到齐娜依达死讯的几天后，因为一种奇怪的、无法抑制的冲动，我去为一位和我们住在同一栋楼的贫苦老妇人送终。她躺在硬板床上，身上盖着破衣烂衫，头下枕着一个麻袋，她死得艰难、痛苦。她究其一生都是在为每日的生计苦苦挣扎；她不知道欢乐，也没有尝到过幸福的甜蜜。别人会想：她当然应为死亡，为她的解脱和安息而感到欣慰。然而，只要她那衰老的身体还在支撑着，只要她那压在冰凉的双手之下的胸脯还在痛苦地起伏，直到最后一丝力气离开她，这位老妇人还在双手交叉，不停地低声祷告：“上帝，请饶恕我的罪过吧”；只有伴随着她意识的最后一点火花，害怕的神情和最后时刻的恐惧才从她的眼睛里消失。我记得那时，在那贫苦老妇人临终的床前，我为齐娜依达感到惊恐，渴望为她祈祷，为我父亲——也为我自己。","But I do myself injustice.Even then, in those light-hearted young days, I was not deaf to the voice of sorrow, when it called upon me, to the solemn strains floating to me from beyond the tomb.I remember, a few days after I heard of Zinaïda’s death, I was present, through a peculiar, irresistible impulse, at the death of a poor old woman who lived in the same house as we.Covered with rags, lying on hard boards, with a sack under her head, she died hardly and painfully.Her whole life had been passed in the bitter struggle with daily want; she had known no joy, had not tasted the honey of happiness.One would have thought, surely she would rejoice at death, at her deliverance, her rest.But yet, as long as her decrepit body held out, as long as her breast still heaved in agony under the icy hand weighing upon it, until her last forces left her, the old woman crossed herself, and kept whispering, ‘Lord, forgive my sins’; and only with the last spark of consciousness, vanished from her eyes the look of fear, of horror of the end.And I remember that then, by the death-bed of that poor old woman, I felt aghast for Zinaïda, and longed to pray for her, for my father—and for myself."
