"作者：马克·吐温","by Mark Twain "
"先后已有两三个人暗示我说，如果我能写篇自传，他们一定会在闲暇时读一读，面对公众的狂热要求，我最终屈服了，同时也借此机会向大家交代一下我的家族史。","Two or three persons having at different times intimated that if I would write an autobiography they would read it when they got leisure, I yield at last to this frenzied public demand and herewith tender my history."
"我们家是名门望族，其悠久的历史可以追溯到古代。据吐温族志记载，我们的始祖本是希金斯家族的近亲。那是在11世纪，当时我们的族人居住在英格兰科克郡的阿伯丁。为什么我们家族一直沿用母姓（为了不显得愚昧，我们中有人会偶尔顽皮地取个别名），而不姓希金斯，这一直是个谜，不过我们当中没有任何人想去找出谜底。这个谜朦胧模糊，浪漫异常，我们没人会去揭开它。所有老一辈的人都是这样做的。","Ours is a noble house, and stretches a long way back into antiquity.The earliest ancestor the Twains have any record of was a friend of the family by the name of Higgins.This was in the eleventh century, when our people were living in Aberdeen, county of Cork, England.Why it is that our long line has ever since borne the maternal name (except when one of them now and then took a playful refuge in an alias to avert foolishness), instead of Higgins, is a mystery which none of us has ever felt much desire to stir.It is a kind of vague, pretty romance, and we leave it alone.All the old families do that way."
"阿瑟·吐温是个很有名气的人物——威廉·鲁弗斯时代的一名公路“掮客”。大约在他30岁的时候，他去了古英国时期一个著名的休闲胜地，名叫纽盖特，他想去处理一些事情，然而却从此再也没有回来。他突然死在了那里。","Arthour Twain was a man of considerable note—a solicitor on the highway in William Rufus’s time.At about the age of thirty he went to one of those fine old English places of resort called Newgate, to see about something, and never returned again.While there he died suddenly."
"奥古斯塔斯·吐温好像是在1160年左右曾名噪一时。他总是尽情地给自己找乐子，常常揣上他那把打磨得很锋利的老军刀，在夜里找个合适的地方，刺穿路人的身体，只是为了看他们跳起来的样子。他的幽默是与生俱来的。但是他幽默得过了头；第一次他被发现正剥一个路人的皮的时候，当局就将其斩首，并把他的头颅高高悬挂在坦普尔栅门一块很好的高地上。这下他可以在这个视野绝佳的地方注视众生，自得其乐了。他从未这么喜欢过一个地方，而且也从未在一个地方呆过这么久。","Augustus Twain seems to have made something of a stir about the year 1160.He was as full of fun as he could be, and used to take his old saber and sharpen it up, and get in a convenient place on a dark night, and stick it through people as they went by, to see them jump.He was a born humorist.But he got to going too far with it; and the first time he was found stripping one of these parties, the authorities removed one end of him, and put it up on a nice high place on Temple Bar, where it could contemplate the people and have a good time.He never liked any situation so much or stuck to it so long."
"在随后的二百年里，我们家族接连出现了很多军人——都是些高尚的、勇敢的人，上战场时他们总是跟在别人后面，高声歌唱，下战场时就会冲到别人前头，连连呐喊。","Then for the next two hundred years the family tree shows a succession of soldiers—noble, high-spirited fellows, who always went into battle singing, right behind the army, and always went out a-whooping, right ahead of it."
"这一事实很好地反驳了已故的老弗罗萨尔特的观点，他曾戏谑说，我们家族这棵大树上只长了一个分支，且这个分支与主干成直角，无论冬夏都可以结出果实。","This is a scathing rebuke to old dead Froissart’s poor witticism that our family tree never had but one limb to it, and that that one stuck out at right angles, and bore fruit winter and summer."
"15世纪初期，我们的家族成员之一博·吐温被人们称为“学者”。他的字写得非常非常好。他可以惟妙惟肖地摹仿任何人的笔迹，以至于看到的人都会大笑不已。这项才能给他带来无限的乐趣。但是后来，他签订了一项凿石开路的合同，艰苦的工作毁了他的手。尽管如此，作为石匠，他一直过得很愉快，除了零星的几年间隔，他这一做就是四十二年。事实上，他死在了工作岗位上。在那些漫长的岁月里，他的工作总会令人很满意，所以手头上的活刚完成不到一周，政府就会再跟他签订新的合同。他是个十足的宠儿。在其艺术家同行中，他也一向备受欢迎，他还是他们那个名叫“链帮”的秘密慈善社团中的显要人物。他总是留着短发，喜欢穿着条纹衣服，政府都为他的死亡而感到遗憾。对他的国家来说，他的死是个让人痛心的损失。因为他是那么地恪守本分。","Early in the fifteenth century we have Beau Twain, called “the Scholar.”He wrote a beautiful, beautiful hand.And he could imitate anybody’s hand so closely that it was enough to make a person laugh his head off to see it.He had infinite sport with his talent.But by and by he took a contract to break stone for a road, and the roughness of the work spoiled his hand.Still, he enjoyed life all the time he was in the stone business, which, with inconsiderable intervals, was some forty-two years.In fact, he died in harness.During all those long years he gave such satisfaction that he never was through with one contract a week till the government gave him another.He was a perfect pet.And he was always a favorite with his fellow-artists, and was a conspicuous member of their benevolent secret society, called the Chain Gang.He always wore his hair short, had a preference for striped clothes, and died lamented by the government.He was a sore loss to his country.For he was so regular."
"很多年后，我们家出了著名的约翰·摩根·吐温。1492年，他以乘客的身份跟着哥伦布的船来到这个国家。他的性情似乎野蛮粗暴，让人讨厌。他一路上都在抱怨饭菜，还常常恐吓说，如果没有改观，他就要上岸。他想吃新鲜的西鲱鱼。他几乎每天都在船上闲逛，鼻孔朝天地嘲笑船长，说他认为哥伦布根本不知道自己要去哪里，之前也从未去过那里。那让人难忘的惊叫“啊！大陆！”让船上的每一个人都激动不已，只有他无动于衷。透过一片烟色玻璃，他注视了一会儿远处水面上那条像是用铅笔画出来的线，说：“哪儿有什么大陆——那是一条木筏！”","Some years later we have the illustrious John Morgan Twain.He came over to this country with Columbus in 1492 as a passenger.He appears to have been of a crusty, uncomfortable disposition.He complained of the food all the way over, and was always threatening to go ashore unless there was a change.He wanted fresh shad.Hardly a day passed over his head that he did not go idling about the ship with his nose in the air, sneering about the commander, and saying he did not believe Columbus knew where he was going to or had ever been there before.The memorable cry of “Land ho!” thrilled every heart in the ship but his.He gazed awhile through a piece of smoked glass at the penciled line lying on the distant water, and then said: “Land be hanged—it’s a raft!”"
"这个可疑的乘客上船时，只带了一张旧报纸，里面包了条标有“B. G.”的手绢，一只标有“L. W. C.”的棉线袜，一只标有“D. F.”的羊毛袜，还有一件标有“O. M. R.”的睡衣。然而，在航行中他比任何人都担心自己的“行李箱”，似乎其他所有乘客的行李加在一起都没有他的贵重。如果“船头下倾”，无法操纵，他就会跑过去，把他的“行李箱”挪向船尾，然后还要看看效果。如果“船尾下倾”，他就会让哥伦布命令一些人去“转移他的行李箱”。有暴风雨的时候必须堵住他的嘴，因为他会为他的“行李箱”大声哭嚎，这使得其他人根本听不到命令。这家伙从未被公开指控有过任何严重的不当行为，但在航海日志里却记载了这样一件“怪事”：虽然上船时他的行李是用一张报纸包着的，但下船时他的行李却装满了四个大皮箱、一个装女王陶的板条箱和几只装香槟的篮子。但他还蛮横无理地回到船上，大摇大摆地走来走去，含沙射影地说自己有些东西不见了，要打开其他人的行李箱检查一下，这实在是太过分了，于是人们把他扔下了船。他们观望了很久，想着他会浮上来，然而，在静静退去的潮水里，连一个水泡也没冒出来。但是，正当每个人都站在船舷，全神贯注地盯着水面，感到越来越好奇的时候，大家惊愕地发现，船漂动了起来，锚索松松地挂在船头。此后，在船上模糊又古老的日志里，我们发现了这么一段离奇的记载：","When this questionable passenger came on board the ship, be brought nothing with him but an old newspaper containing a handkerchief marked “B.G.,” one cotton sock marked “L.W.C.,” one woolen one marked “D.F.,” and a night-shirt marked “O.M.R.”And yet during the voyage he worried more about his “trunk,” and gave himself more airs about it, than all the rest of the passengers put together.If the ship was “down by the head,” and would not steer, he would go and move his “trunk” further aft, and then watch the effect.If the ship was “by the stern,” he would suggest to Columbus to detail some men to “shift that baggage.”In storms he had to be gagged, because his wailings about his “trunk” made it impossible for the men to hear the orders.The man does not appear to have been openly charged with any gravely unbecoming thing, but it is noted in the ship’s log as a “curious circumstance” that albeit he brought his baggage on board the ship in a newspaper, he took it ashore in four trunks, a queensware crate, and a couple of champagne baskets.But when he came back insinuating, in an insolent, swaggering way, that some of this things were missing, and was going to search the other passengers’ baggage, it was too much, and they threw him overboard.They watched long and wonderingly for him to come up, but not even a bubble rose on the quietly ebbing tide.But while every one was most absorbed in gazing over the side, and the interest was momentarily increasing, it was observed with consternation that the vessel was adrift and the anchor-cable hanging limp from the bow.Then in the ship’s dimmed and ancient log we find this quaint note:"
"“后来发现，这个讨厌的乘客原来钻到了水里，卸下了船锚，拿去卖给了从内陆来的该死的野蛮子，还说是自己捡到的，真是个混蛋！”","“In time it was discouvered yt ye troblesome passenger hadde gone downe and got ye anchor, and toke ye same and solde it to ye dam sauvages from ye interior, saying yt he hadde founde it, ye sonne of a ghun!”"
"然而，这位先辈本性善良，品质高贵，并且是第一位乐于帮助和教化印第安人的白人，每想到此我们都倍感骄傲。他建了所宽敞的监狱，装了绞架，就在临终前几天，他还得意地声称，他对印第安人的管束和教化，比其他任何同样为此努力的改革家都要有成效得多。就这一点而言，家族史上的记载便显得不那么诚实可信了，同时描述也不够简洁，而且结尾过于仓促，只是说这位老航海家去美洲看他的绞架如何绞死第一个白人，然而，在那里他却受了伤，并为此断送了性命。","Yet this ancestor had good and noble instincts, and it is with pride that we call to mind the fact that he was the first white person who ever interested himself in the work of elevating and civilizing our Indians.He built a commodious jail and put up a gallows, and to his dying day he claimed with satisfaction that he had had a more restraining and elevating influence on the Indians than any other reformer that ever labored among them.At this point the chronicle becomes less frank and chatty, and closes abruptly by saying that the old voyager went to see his gallows perform on the first white man ever hanged in America, and while there received injuries which terminated in his death."
"那位“改革家”的曾孙在一六零几年发达起来，尽管在历史上他还有其他头衔，但家族史上称他是“老海上司令”。他长期指挥着许多武器装备齐全、人员配备充足的快艇，对加快商船行驶速度功不可没。凡是他跟进指挥的船都会迅速地越过重洋。但是，如果有船不听从他的指挥，仍旧悠闲地航行，他会怒不可遏——此时，他就会把船弄到他的住所附近，小心翼翼地把船安置好，等着船主来领取，但他们从没来过。他会强迫船员们做些剧烈运动，然后再跳到水里，以此尽可能地改掉他们身上游手好闲、懒惰散漫的缺点。他称这种做法叫“走板”。所有受训人员都很喜欢这种训练。不管怎样，他们试过之后都没有发现有什么不妥之处。如果取船期限已过，船主还未来索取，这位“海上司令”就会烧掉这些船，因为这样保险金不会损失。最终，这位老水手在他事业最辉煌的时候，被残忍地杀害了。直到临终前，他那伤心欲绝的遗孀还认为，如果再早十五分钟遇袭，他还有可能被救活。","The great-grandson of the “Reformer” flourished in sixteen hundred and something, and was known in our annals as “the old Admiral,” though in history he had other titles.He was long in command of fleets of swift vessels, well armed and manned, and did great service in hurrying up merchantmen.Vessels which he followed and kept his eagle eye on, always made good fair time across the ocean.But if a ship still loitered in spite of all he could do, his indignation would grow till he could contain himself no longer— and then he would take that ship home where he lived and keep it there carefully, expecting the owners to come for it, but they never did.And he would try to get the idleness and sloth out of the sailors of that ship by compelling them to take invigorating exercise and a bath.He called it “walking a plank.”All the pupils liked it.At any rate, they never found any fault with it after trying it.When the owners were late coming for their ships, the Admiral always burned them, so that the insurance money should not be lost.At last this fine old tar was cut down in the fullness of his years and honors.And to her dying day, his poor heart-broken widow believed that if he had been cut down fifteen minutes sooner he might have been resuscitated."
"查尔斯·亨利·吐温生活在17世纪末期，是位热心又杰出的传道士。他使一万六千名南洋岛民信奉了基督教，还告诫他们，祷告时只戴一串狗牙项链和一副眼镜是不够的。那群可怜的教徒非常非常敬重他；在他的葬礼结束时，他们同时起身（一起走出饭店），满眼是泪，互相称赞说，他真是一位善良仁慈的传教士，他们希望能有更多像他这样的人。","Charles Henry Twain lived during the latter part of the seventeenth century, and was a zealous and distinguished missionary.He converted sixteen thousand South Sea islanders, and taught them that a dog-tooth necklace and a pair of spectacles was not enough clothing to come to divine service in.His poor flock loved him very, very dearly; and when his funeral was over, they got up in a body (and came out of the restaurant) with tears in their eyes, and saying, one to another, that he was a good tender missionary, and they wished they had some more of him."
"帕—苟—吐—瓦—瓦—浦可特吉维斯（长着猪眼的强大猎人吐温）给18世纪中叶增光不少，他全心全意帮助布拉多克将军抵抗压迫者华盛顿。正是这位祖先从树后向我们的华盛顿开了十七枪。到此为止，崇尚道德的家族史里记载的美妙浪漫故事都是没错的；但随后它描述道，打了十七枪后，那个充满敬畏之情的野蛮人严肃地说，那个人受神灵保护，是成大事的人，他不敢用那只亵渎神明的枪射击他，这个故事严重歪曲了历史。他其实是这样说的：","Pah-go-to-wah-wah-pukketekeewis (Mighty-Hunter-with-a-Hog-Eye-Twain) adorned the middle of the eighteenth century, and aided General Braddock with all his heart to resist the oppressor Washington.It was this ancestor who fired seventeen times at our Washington from behind a tree.So far the beautiful romantic narrative in the moral story-books is correct; but when that narrative goes on to say that at the seventeenth round the awe-stricken savage said solemnly that that man was being reserved by the Great Spirit for some mighty mission, and he dared not lift his sacrilegious rifle against him again, the narrative seriously impairs the integrity of history.What he did say was:"
"“没，（呃）没用。那个人醉得站不住，根本打不中他。我（呃）我可不能再在他身上浪费子弹了。”","“It ain’t no (hic) no use.‘At man’s so drunk he can’t stan’ still long enough for a man to hit him.I (hic) I can’t ‘ford to fool away any more am’nition on him.”"
"这才是他打了十七枪后停下来的理由，这个理由充足、简单、而又真实，很容易让我们接受，因为它生动且颇有说服力。","That was why he stopped at the seventeenth round, and it was a good, plain, matter-of-fact reason, too, and one that easily commends itself to us by the eloquent, persuasive flavor of probability there is about it."
"我也喜欢这本家族史中的故事，但还是感觉特别地疑惑，在布拉多克那场失败的战役中，每个印第安人在瞄准敌人打了两枪（“二”在一个世纪的时间里很容易被人们增加到“十七”）却没打中时，都会草草下结论说，神灵保佑了那个人，因为他将成大事，所以我总觉得，华盛顿的事被记住，而其他士兵的都被遗忘，只是因为预言只在他身上应验了，而在其他人身上却没有。世上没有足够的书能记录下印第安人和其他部落的所有预言；但人人都可以把应验了的预言记录下来，并装进大衣兜里。","I also enjoyed the story-book narrative, but I felt a marring misgiving that every Indian at Braddock’s Defeat who fired at a soldier a couple of times (two easily grows to seventeen in a century), and missed him, jumped to the conclusion that the Great Spirit was reserving that soldier for some grand mission; and so I somehow feared that the only reason why Washington’s case is remembered and the others forgotten is, that in his the prophecy came true, and in that of the others it didn’t.There are not books enough on earth to contain the record of the prophecies Indians and other unauthorized parties have made; but one may carry in his overcoat pockets the record of all the prophecies that have been fulfilled."
"在这里我要顺便提一下，我的某些祖先在历史上曾以他们的别名闻名天下，所以我觉得现在没必要提及他们，更没必要按年龄顺序介绍他们。这些人中包括：理查德·布林斯利·吐温，又名盖伊·福克斯；约翰·温特沃思·吐温，又名十六弦杰克；威廉·霍格思·吐温，又名杰克·谢泼德；阿纳尼亚斯·吐温，又名蒙绰森男爵；约翰·乔治·吐温，又名基德船长；还有乔治·弗朗西斯·吐温、汤姆·佩珀、尼布甲尼撒、巴兰的阿斯——他们都是我们的家族成员，但实际上却属于另一个旁系——与高贵的直系之间界限分明，他们与古老世系的主要区别是：为了获得我们一直渴望和追求的臭名，他们用了进监狱这种下策，而不是受绞刑。","I will remark here, in passing, that certain ancestors of mine are so thoroughly well-known in history by their aliases, that I have not felt it to be worth while to dwell upon them, or even mention them in the order of their birth.Among these may be mentioned Richard Brinsley Twain, alias Guy Fawkes; John Wentworth Twain, alias Sixteen-String Jack; William Hogarth Twain, alias Jack Sheppard; Ananias Twain, alias Baron Munchausen; John George Twain, alias Captain Kydd; and then there are George Francis Twain, Tom Pepper, Nebuchadnezzar, and Baalam’s Ass—they all belong to our family, but to a branch of it somewhat distinctly removed from the honorable direct line—in fact, a collateral branch, whose members chiefly differ from the ancient stock in that, in order to acquire the notoriety we have always yearned and hungered for, they have got into a low way of going to jail instead of getting hanged."
"写自传的时候最好不要描述离自己很近的几辈人——含糊地提一下曾祖父，然后直接跳到自己，这样写才最安全，我现在就是这样做的。","It is not well, when writing an autobiography, to follow your ancestry down too close to your own time—it is safest to speak only vaguely of your great-grandfather, and then skip from there to yourself, which I now do."
"我出生时没有牙齿——这点，理查德三世要比我强；但我出生时不驼背，这点我比他强。我的父母不是太穷，但也不是很老实。","I was born without teeth—and there Richard III. had the advantage of me; but I was born without a humpback, likewise, and there I had the advantage of him.My parents were neither very poor nor conspicuously honest."
"但我现在突然意识到，和我的祖辈相比，我的经历看起来似乎太平淡了，所以，明智的选择就是等到自己被绞死后再写。如果我以前读到的传记都能写完祖先就停笔，等有类似事件发生后再继续写下去，那这对广大读者来说真是件好事。您觉得呢？","But now a thought occurs to me.My own history would really seem so tame contrasted with that of my ancestors, that it is simply wisdom to leave it unwritten until I am hanged.If some other biographies I have read had stopped with the ancestry until a like event occurred, it would have been a felicitous thing for the reading public.How does it strike you?"
