"拾陆 中国的土地问题","CHAPTER XVI AGRARIAN PROBLEMS IN CHINA"
"上述一个中国村庄的经济生活状况是对一个样本进行微观分析的结果。在这一有限范围内观察的现象无疑是属于局部性质的。但他们也有比较广泛的意义，因为这个村庄同中国绝大多数的其他村子一样，具有共同的进程。由此我们能够了解到中国土地问题的一些显著特征。","The above account of the economic life of a Chinese village is the result of a microscopic examination of a specimen. The phenomena observed in this confined area undoubtedly are of a local character. But they also have wider significance because this village shares a common process with most other Chinese villages. Hence we can learn some of the salient features of the agrarian problems in China."
"中国农村的基本问题，简单地说，就是农民的收入降低到不足以维持最低生活水平所需的程度。中国农村真正的问题是人民的饥饿问题。","The essential problem in Chinese villages, putting it in the simplest terms, is that the income of the villagers has been reduced to such an extent that it is not sufficient even to meet the expenditure in securing the minimum requirements of livelihood. It is the hunger of the people that is the real issue in China."
"在这个村里，当前经济萧条的直接原因是家庭手工业的衰落。经济萧条并非由于产品的质量低劣或数量下降。如果农民生产同等品质和同样数量的蚕丝，他们却不能从市场得到同过去等量的钱币。萧条的原因在于乡村工业和世界市场之间的关系问题。蚕丝价格的降低是由于生产和需求之间缺乏调节。","In this village, the immediate cause of the present economic depression is the decline of domestic industry. The present depression is not due to a deterioration of quality nor to a decrease of the quantity of production. Had the villagers produced the same type and the same amount of silk, they could not get the same amount of money from the market as between the village industry and the world market. It is the lack of adjustment between production and demand that accounts for the fall in the price of silk."
"由于家庭手工业的衰落，农民只能在改进产品或放弃手工业两者之间选择其一。正如我已说明的，改进产品不仅是一个技术改进的问题，而且也是一个社会再组织的问题。甚至于这些也还是不够的。农村企业组织的成功与否，最终取决于中国工业发展的前景。目前的分析对那些低估国际资本主义经济力量的改革者来说，是一个警告。","In view of the decline of domestic industry, the only alternatives open to the peasants are to improve their produce or to give up the industry. To improve the produce, as I have shown, is not only a matter of technical improvement but also a matter of social reorganization. Even this is not enough. A successful reorganization of rural industry depends ultimately on the prospects of industrial development in China. The present analysis is a warning to reformers who tend to underrate the force of international capitalist economy."
"如果农村企业不立即恢复，农民只得被迫选择后者。他们将失望地放弃传统的收入来源，正如在纺织工业中已经发生的那样。如果从衰败的家庭手工业解除出来的劳动力能用于其他活动，情况还不至于如此严重。必须认识到工业发展中，某些工业并不一定适合留在农村。但就目前来说，尚无新的职业代替旧职业，劳力的浪费将意味着家庭收入的进一步减少。","If there is no immediate recovery of rural industry, the peasants will be forced to adopt the second alternative. They will in despair give up their traditional source of income, as has already happened in the weav-ing industry. If the labour released from the doomed domestic industry could be used in other productive activities, the situation would not be so desperate. It must be recognized that in industrial development there are certain industries which it may not be advisable to retain in the village. But in so far as there is no new occupation to take the place of the old, the waste of labour will mean a further reduction in family income."
"当他们的收入不断下降，经济没有迅速恢复的希望时，农民当然只得紧缩开支。中国农民的开支有四类：日常需要的支出，定期礼仪费用，生产资金，以及利息、地租、捐税等。正如我们已经看到的，农民已经尽可能地将礼仪上的开支推迟，甚至必要时将储备的粮食出售。看来，农民的开支中最严峻的一种是最后一种。如果人民不能支付不断增加的利息、地租和捐税，他不仅将遭受高利贷者和收租人、税吏的威胁和虐待，而且还会受到监禁和法律制裁。但当饥饿超过枪杀的恐惧时，农民起义便发生了。也许就是这种情况导致了华北的“红枪会”和华中的共产主义运动。如果《西行漫记》的作者是正确的话，驱使成百万农民进行英勇长征的主要动力不是别的，而是饥饿和对土地所有者及收租人的仇恨。","As their income is diminishing and as there is no hope of immediate recovery, the peasants can naturally only resort to a corresponding reduction of expenditure. In expenditure, as the Chinese peasants are concerned, there are four categories: necessary daily account, periodical ceremonial expenses, capital for production, and interest, rent, and tax. As we have seen, the villagers have already suspended ceremonies as far as possible, and even sold their rice reserve when necessary. It appears that the most rigid category is the last one. If the people are not able to pay their ever-increasing interest, rent, and tax, they will be threatened by brutal treatment from the usurers, and rent and tax collectors, and by legal enforcement through imprisonment. But when hunger is stronger than the fear of being shot, peasant revolts take place. Perhaps, this is the situation that has resulted in the disturbance of the Red Spear Club in North China and the Communist movement in Central China. If the author of *Red Star Over China* is right, the main force that drove millions of peasants in the heroic long march was nothing but hunger and its derived hatred of landowners and tax collectors."
"在现在这个研究中，我试图说明单纯地谴责土地所有者或甚至是高利贷者为邪恶的人是不对的。当农村需要外界的钱来供给他们生产资金时，除非有一个较好的信贷系统可供农民借贷，否则不在地主和高利贷是自然会产生的。如果没有他们，情况可能更坏。目前，由于地租没有保证，已经出现一种倾向，即城市资本流向对外通商口岸，而不流入农村，上海的投机企业危机反复发生就说明了这一点。农村地区资金缺乏，促使城镇高利贷发展。农村经济越萧条，资金便越缺乏，高利贷亦越活跃——这个恶性循环耗尽了农民的血汗。","In the present study, I have tried to show that it is incorrect to condemn landowners and even usurers as wicked persons. When the village needs money from outside to finance their production, unless there is a better system to extend credit to the peasants, absentee-landlordism and usury are the natural products. Without them, the situation might be still worse. At present, owing to the insecurity of rent, there is already a tendency for urban capital to move into the treaty- ports instead of into rural districts, as seen in the recurrence of crises in Shanghai speculative enterprises. The scarcity of capital available in rural districts encourages the development of usury in the town. The more depressed is the country, the less capital is available, and the more active is the usury — a vicious circle which saps the life of the peasants."
"中国的土地问题面临的另一个困境是：国民党政府在纸上写下了种种诺言和政策，但事实上，它把绝大部分收入都耗费于反共运动，所以它不可能采取任何实际行动和措施来进行改革，而共产主义运动的实质，正如我所指出的，是由于农村对土地制不满而引起的一种反抗，尽管各方提出各种理由，但有一件事是清楚的，农民的境况是越来越糟糕了。自从政府重占红色区域以来到目前为止，中国没有任何一个地区完成了永久性的土地改革。","There was another dilemma in the Chinese land problem. The national government with all its promises and policies on paper was not able to carry out any practical measures owing to the fact that most of the revenue was spent in its anti-communist campaign, while, as I have pointed out, the real nature of the communist movement was a peasant revolt due to their dissatisfaction with the land system. Despite all kinds of justification on either side, one thing is clear: that the conditions of the peasants are getting worse and worse. So far no permanent land reform has been accomplished in any part of China since the recovery of the Red Area by the government."
"我们必须认识到，仅仅实行土地改革、减收地租、平均地权，并不能最终解决中国的土地问题。但这种改革是必要的，也是紧迫的，因为它是解除农民痛苦的不可缺少的步骤。它将给农民以喘息的机会，排除了引起“反叛”的原因，才可以团结一切力量寻求工业发展的道路。","It must be realized that a mere land reform in the form of reduction of rent and equalization of ownership does not promise a final solution of agrarian problems in China. Such a reform, however, is necessary and urgent because it is an indispensable step in relieving the peasants. It will give a breathing space for the peasants and, by removing the cause leading to “revolt,” will unite all forces in finding the way to industrial recovery."
"最终解决中国土地问题的办法不在于紧缩农民的开支而应该增加农民的收入。因此，让我再重申一遍，恢复农村工业是根本的措施。中国的传统工业主要是乡村手工业，例如，整个纺织工业本来是农民的职业。目前，中国实际上正面临着这种传统工业的迅速衰亡，这完全是由于西方工业扩张的缘故。在发展工业的问题上，中国就同西方列强处于矛盾之中。如何能和平地解决这个矛盾是一个问题，我将把这个问题留待其他有能力的科学家和政治家去解决了。","A final solution of agrarian problems in China lies not so much in reduction of expenditure of the peasants but in increasing their income. Therefore, industrial recovery, let me repeat once more, is essential. The traditional industry of China was mainly rural; for example, the entire textile industry was formerly a peasant occupation. At present, China is, in fact, facing a rapid decay of this traditional industry directly due to the industrial expansion of the West. By arresting this process, China comes into conflict with the Western Powers. How this conflict can be solved peacefully is a question I would like to leave to other competent scientists and politicians."
"但是有一点与中国未来的工业发展有关，必须在此加以强调。在现代工业世界中，中国是一名后进者，中国有条件避免前人犯过的错误。在这个村庄里，我们已经看到一个以合作为原则来发展小型工厂的实验是如何进行的。与西方资本主义工业发展相对照，这个实验旨在防止生产资料所有权的集中。尽管它遇到了很多困难甚至失败，但在中国乡村工业未来的发展问题上，这样一个实验是具有重要意义的。","But one point connected with the future industrial development in China must be stressed here. Being a late comer in the modern industrial world, China is in a position to avoid those errors which have been committed by her predecessors. In the village, we have seen how an experiment has been made in developing a small-scale factory on the principle of co-operation. It is designed to prevent the concentration of ownership of means of production in contrast with the capitalist industrial development in the West. In spite of all difficulties and even failures, such an experiment is of great significance in the problem of the future development of rural industry in China."
"最后，我要强调的是，上述问题自从日本入侵以来并未消失。这种悲剧在建设我们的新中国过程中是不可避免的。这是我们迟早必然面临的国际问题的一部分。只有经历这场斗争，我们才有希望真正建设起自己的国家。在斗争过程中，土地问题事实上已经成为一个更加生死攸关的问题。只有通过合理有效的土地改革，解除农民的痛苦，我们与外国侵略者斗争的胜利才能有保证。现在日本入侵，给我们一个机会去打破过去在土地问题上的恶性循环。成千个村庄，像开弦弓一样，事实上已经被入侵者破坏，然而在它们的废墟中，内部冲突和巨大耗费的斗争最后必将终止。一个崭新的中国将出现在这个废墟之上。我衷心希望，未来的一代会肯定我们以理解和同情的态度正视我们时代的问题。我们只有齐心协力，认清目标，展望未来，才不辜负于我们所承受的一切牺牲和苦难。","Finally, I would like to emphasize that the above-mentioned problems have not disappeared since the present Japanese invasion. The tragedy is unavoidable in building our new China. It is a part of our international adjustment that sooner or later we must face. Only by going through it, can we hope for a real reconstruction of our country. During the struggle, the agrarian problems in fact have become more vital. Our victory against foreign aggression can be insured only by removing internal conflicts through relieving the peasants by a reasonable and effective land reform. Now Japan has offered us an opportunity to break our old vicious circle in the land problem. It is true that thousands of villages have already, like Kaihsienkung, been destroyed by the invaders, but in their ruin our internal conflicts and follies should find their last resting-place. From the ruin, a new China will emerge. The coming generation will, I sincerely hope, credit us with facing the problems of our age in a spirit of understanding and sympathy; our sacrifices and the hardship we are undergoing shall stand vindicated only if we look forward to the future with oneness of purpose and clarity of vision."
