"太阳","Sun"
"第一章","CHAPTER I"
"“带她出去晒晒太阳。”医生说道。她自己很怀疑太阳的疗效，但是却愿意和她的孩子、护士以及母亲一起出去漂洋过海。","“Take her away, into the sun,” the doctor said.She herself was sceptical of the sun, but she permitted herself to be carried away, with her child, and a nurse, and her mother, over the sea."
"船在午夜时分启航。在孩子已经上床睡觉，乘客们也登上船时，她丈夫一直陪伴在她的身旁，长达两个小时。这是一个漆黑的夜晚，哈得孙河在黑暗中起起伏伏，倾洒而出的点点波光荡漾在河面上。她斜靠在栏杆上，看着下面的海水，思索着：这就是大海；它比人想象得更深，里面的回忆比人想象得更多。那一刻，大海波涛滚滚，就似一条狂舞不止的大蛇。","The ship sailed at midnight.And for two hours her husband stayed with her, while the child was put to bed, and the passengers came on board.It was a black night, the Hudson swayed with heaving blackness, shaken over with spilled dribbles of light.She leaned over the rail, and looking down thought: this is the sea; it is deeper than one imagines, and fuller of memories.At that moment the sea seemed to heave like the serpent of chaos that has lived for ever."
"“你知道，这种分离没有好处，”她的丈夫在她身旁说着，“分离一点都不好。我不喜欢分离。”","“These partings are no good, you know,” her husband was saying, at her side.“They’re no good.I don’t like them.”"
"他的语调里充满了担心、恐惧，还有最后的一丝期待。","His tone was full of apprehension, misgiving, and there was a certain clinging to the last straw of hope."
"“是的，我也不喜欢。”她含混地回答道。她记得他们曾是多么地想离开彼此，不管是他或是她。离情别绪对她的情绪有些许触动，但这只会让她心灵上的枷锁给她带去更多伤害。","“No, neither do I,” she responded in a flat voice.She remembered how bitterly they wanted to get away from one another, he and she.The emotion of parting gave a slight tug at her emotions, but only caused the iron that had gone into her soul to gore deeper."
"他们看着熟睡中的儿子，父亲的眼睛湿润了。但眼睛的湿润并不重要，重要的是雷打不动的习惯的节奏，那种长年累月的生活习惯，以及根深蒂固的权力意识。","So, they looked at their sleeping son, and the father’s eyes were wet.But it is not the wetting of the eyes that counts, it is the deep iron rhythm of habit, the year-long, life-habits; the deep-set stroke of power."
"并且在他们两人的生活中，他的和她的权利意识是对彼此不利的。就像两台运作极不和谐的引擎，在互相损毁着。","And in their two lives, the stroke of power was hostile, his and hers.Like two engines running at variance, they shattered one another."
"“上岸了！上岸了！”","“All ashore!All ashore!”"
"“莫里斯，你必须走了。”","“Maurice, you must go.”"
"她暗自思忖道：对他而言是上岸了！对我来说，则是出海了！","And she thought to herself: For him it is All Ashore!For me it is Out to Sea!"
"他在午夜沉闷的码头上挥舞着手帕，船渐渐驶离了港口，他也只是送行人群中的一个而已。送行人群中的一个！仅此而已！","Well, he waved his hanky on the midnight dreariness of the pier, as the boat inched away; one among a crowd.One among a crowd!C’est ça!"
"那些渡轮，就像堆满了一排排灯光的大盘子，正斜穿过哈得孙河。那漆黑的河口一定是拉克万纳港口了。","The ferry-boats, like great dishes piled with rows of lights, were still slanting across the Hudson.That black mouth must be the Lackawanna Station."
"船在灯火间蹒跚前行，哈得孙河似乎永无止境。终于，他们绕过了弯道，眼前闪烁着巴特里稀疏的灯光。自由女神发脾气似的高举着火炬。传来了波涛拍打海岸的声音。","The ship ebbed on between the lights, the Hudson seemed interminable.But at last they were round the bend, and there was the poor harvest of lights at the Battery.Liberty flung up her torch in a tantrum.There was the wash of the sea."
"尽管大西洋如火山熔岩般灰暗，但他们终于迎来了曙光。在湛蓝的海边她有一栋房子，那儿有着大大的花园，或者说是葡萄园，葡萄藤和橄榄树如梯田般层层叠下，一直蔓延到狭窄的海岸边；花园里有很多秘密之处，幽深的柠檬树丛绵延到地表裂缝，里面蓄着几池碧水，一股清泉从洞穴中潺潺流出，在希腊人到这里之前，这曾是西库尔人饮酒娱乐之处；一只灰色的山羊咩咩地叫着，被拴在一个壁龛空空的古老坟墓里面。四下里弥漫着含羞草的味道，远处是积了雪的火山。","And though the Atlantic was grey as lava, they did come at last into the sun.Even she had a house above the bluest of seas, with a vast garden, or vineyard, all vines and olives, dropping steeply in terrace after terrace, to the strip of coast plain; and the garden full of secret places, deep groves of lemon far down in the cleft of earth, and hidden, pure green reservoirs of water; then a spring issuing out of a little cavern, where the old Sicules had drunk before the Greeks came; and a grey goat bleating, stabled in an ancient tomb with the niches empty.There was the scent of mimosa, and beyond, the snow of the volcano."
"她看见了这一切，从某种程度上说，它给了她些许安慰。但这只是表面现象。她并不在乎这些。她仍然一成不变，内心充满了愤怒和挫折感，无力去感受任何真实的事物。孩子模仿着她，打乱了她内心的宁静。她觉得对他负责是那么地令她害怕和恐惧：就好像是她必须为他的每一次呼吸负责。而那对于她、她的孩子，以及所有涉足其中的人都是痛苦的。","She saw it all, and in a measure it was soothing.But it was all external.She didn’t really care about it.She was herself just the same, with all her anger and frustration inside her, and her incapacity to feel anything real.The child imitated her, and preyed on her peace of mind.She felt so horribly, ghastly responsible for him: as if she must be responsible for every breath he drew.And that was torture to her, to the child, and to everybody else concerned."
"“你知道，朱丽叶，医生叫你脱掉衣服，躺在太阳下面。你为什么不呢？”她的妈妈说。","“You know, Juliet, the doctor told you to lie in the sun, without your clothes.Why don’t you?” said her mother."
"“当我适合那样做的时候，我自然会去做。你想害死我吗？”朱丽叶冲着她发脾气。","“When I am fit to do so, I will.Do you want to kill me?”Juliet flew at her."
"“害死你，不！只是为了你好。”","“To kill you, no!Only to do you good.”"
"“看在上帝的份上，不要再想着为我好了。”","“For God’s sake, leave off wanting to do me good.”"
"母亲最终很受伤、很愤怒地离开了。","The mother at last was so hurt and incensed, she departed."
"大海变成了白色，接着便什么也看不见了。大雨倾盆而下。呆在这座专门为晒太阳而搭建的房子中很冷。","The sea went white, and then invisible.Pouring rain fell.It was cold, in the house built for the sun."
"又一个早晨，太阳冉冉升起，灼热炽烈，光芒四射，袒露在海面上。房子面朝东南，朱丽叶躺在床上，看着太阳升起。就好像她以前从未看见过太阳升起一样。她从未看见这样毫无遮掩的太阳从海平线上升起，他抖落一身的黑暗，就像是抖落一身的湿气似的。他是那么圆满，赤裸坦荡。她想靠近他。","Again a morning when the sun lifted himself molten and sparkling, naked over the sea’s rim.The house faced south-east, Juliet lay in her bed and watched him rise.It was as if she had never seen the sun rise before.She had never seen the naked sun stand up pure upon the sea-line, shaking the night off himself, like wetness.And he was full and naked.And she wanted to come to him."
"向太阳袒露自己的欲望在她体内悄悄升起。她像珍藏着一个秘密似的珍藏着她的欲望。她想和太阳融为一体。","So the desire sprang secretly in her, to be naked to the sun.She cherished her desire like a secret.She wanted to come together with the sun."
"可那样她就得远离这座房子——远离人群。但在这块每棵橄榄树都长着眼睛、每个陡坡都能被远远地看见的地方，想藏起来和太阳融合在一起，是多么不容易。","But she would have to go away from the house—away from people.And it is not easy, in a country where every olive tree has eyes, and every slope is seen from afar, to go hidden, and have intercourse with the sun."
"但她找到了一块地方：一个布满岩石的悬崖伸向海面、迎着太阳，上面长满了被称作是仙人果的巨大仙人掌。在浓密的仙人掌丛中，一棵柏树直插云霄，它有着苍白而厚重的树干，斜着的树梢很有弹性。它像一个卫士一样站在那儿，面朝大海；它又如一支蜡烛，巨大的火焰是光明映衬下的黑暗：长舌般的黑暗蹿上天空。","But she found a place: a rocky bluff shoved out to the sea and sun, and overgrown with the large cactus called prickly pear.Out of this thicket of cactus rose one cypress tree, with a pallid, thick trunk, and a tip that leaned over, flexible, in the blue.It stood like a guardian looking to sea; or a candle whose huge flame was darkness against light: the long tongue of darkness licking up at the sky."
"朱丽叶坐在柏树旁，脱下衣服。弯弯曲曲的仙人掌在她的身旁形成一道屏障，既可怕又迷人。她坐下来，向着太阳袒露着她的胸脯，叹息着，直到现在。不得不交出自己是如此残酷，她感到非常痛楚：但这情人并不是人类，这令她十分喜悦。","Juliet sat down by the cypress tree, and took off her clothes.The contorted cactus made a forest, hideous yet fascinating, about her.She sat and offered her bosom to the sun, sighing, even now, with a certain hard pain, against the cruelty of having to give herself: but exulting that at last it was no human lover."
"太阳在蓝色的天空中遨游，洒下一路光辉。她感到轻柔的海风拂弄着她的胸部，就好像它们永远不会成熟。但她几乎感觉不到太阳。她的胸部，还未成熟就即将枯萎的果实。","But the sun marched in blue heaven and sent down his rays as he went.She felt the soft air of the sea on her breasts, that seemed as if they would never ripen.But she hardly felt the sun.Fruits that would wither and not mature, her breasts."
"然而，很快，她便感受到了胸中的太阳，比任何一次爱情都要温暖，比牛奶和她孩子的手都要温暖。终于，她的胸部就像是烈日下的长长的白葡萄。","Soon, however, she felt the sun inside them, warmer than ever love had been, warmer than milk or the hands of her baby.At last, her breasts were like long white grapes in the hot sun."
"她脱掉所有的衣服，裸体躺在阳光之下，她躺着的时候，透过指缝注视着太阳的中心。他是蓝色的，如此丰满，正有力地搏动着，外边缘还放射出熠熠光辉。奇妙的蓝色搏动着，活力四射，边缘散射出白色的火焰，太阳！他低头面向她，蓝色的身体上都是火焰。他包裹着她的胸部、她的脸、她的脖子、她疲惫的腹部、她的膝盖、她的大腿和她的脚。","She slid off all her clothes, and lay naked in the sun, and as she lay she looked up through her fingers at the central sun, his blue pulsing roundness, whose outer edges streamed brilliance.Pulsing with marvellous blue, and alive, and streaming white fire from his edges, the Sun!He faced down to her with blue body of fire, and enveloped her breasts and her face, her throat, her tired belly, her knees, her thighs and her feet."
"她闭眼躺着，玫瑰色的火光穿透她的眼帘。光线太强了。她伸手摘下一片叶子覆盖在眼睛上。她便又躺下了，就像阳光下一只长长的葫芦，绿色的，就快要成熟，变成金色。","She lay with shut eyes, the colour of rosy flame through her lids.It was too much.She reached and put leaves over her eyes.Then she lay again, like a long gourd in the sun, green that must ripen to gold."
"她感到阳光穿透了她的骨头，不仅如此，甚至进入了她的情感和思想。她情绪深处的紧张开始消散，思想深处的坚冰开始慢慢融化。她逐渐感到浑身温暖。翻过身，她让自己的肩头裸露在太阳下，还有她的腰、她大腿的后侧，甚至她的脚后跟。她躺着，对发生在她身体里面奇妙的变化感到有点惊讶。","She could feel the sun penetrating into her bones; nay, further, even into her emotions and thoughts.The dark tensions of her emotion began to give way, the cold dark clots of her thoughts began to dissolve.She was beginning to be warm right through.Turning over, she let her shoulders lie in the sun, her loins, the backs of her thighs, even her heels.And she lay half stunned with the strangeness of the thing that was happening to her."
"她疲惫、冰冷的心开始融化，并且在融化时，渐渐蒸发。只有她的子宫还一直紧张和抵触着，永远地抵触着。它甚至抵触着太阳。","Her weary, chilled heart was melting, and in melting, evaporation.Only her womb remained tense and resistant, the eternal resistance.It would resist even the sun."
"她穿上衣服，再次躺了下去。她抬头看着柏树，树顶的那根细丝随着微风轻轻摆动。同时，她感受到漫步在天际的那伟大的太阳，也意识到了自己的抵触。","When she was dressed again she lay once more and looked up at the cypress tree, whose crest, a filament, fell this way and that in the breeze.Meanwhile, she was conscious of the great sun roaming in heaven, and of her own resistance."
"于是，她昏昏沉沉地向家走去，都快看不见了，一方面是被阳光照得目眩，另一方面是被晒得头脑发昏。而这种看不见的状态对她而言就像是一笔财富，她那模糊、温暖、沉重的半清醒状态也像是一种财富。","So, dazed, she went home, only half-seeing, sun-blinded and sun-dazed.And her blindness was like a richness to her, and her dim, warm, heavy half-consciousness was like wealth."
"“妈妈！妈妈！”她的孩子朝她跑过来，用一种小鸟似的奇特的声音呼唤着她，在那声音里有着一种痛苦的需求，他总是那么需要她。她很惊讶地发现，这次她沉睡的心灵没有感到任何的焦虑和爱的压力。她把孩子抱在怀里，但她想着：他不应该是这样一个蠢蛋!　　　　　　　　　如果他能晒晒太阳，他会很快成长起来。——她又感到了子宫中强烈的抵抗，对他，对所有的一切。","“Mummy!Mummy!” her child came running towards her, calling in that peculiar bird-like little anguish of want, always wanting her.She was surprised that her drowsed heart for once felt none of the anxious love-tension in return.She caught the child up in her arms, but she thought: He should not be such a lump!If he had any sun in him, he would spring up.—And she felt again the unyielding resistance of her womb, against him and everything."
"她很愤怒，他的小手企图抓住她，尤其是抓住她的脖子。她移开脖子。她不想孩子抓住它。她把孩子放下。","She resented, rather, his little hands clutching at her, especially her neck.She pulled her throat away.She did not want him getting hold of it.She put the child down."
"“跑！”她说道，“去太阳下跑步！”","“Run!” she said.“Run in the sun!”"
"接着她脱下孩子的衣服，把他光着身子放到暖和的台阶上。","And there and then she took off his clothes and set him naked on the warm terrace."
"“去太阳下玩！”她说。","“Play in the sun!” she said."
"他吓坏了，就快哭出来。但她，身体很暖、懒洋洋的，心是完全冷漠的，还有充满抵触的子宫。她顺着红色的瓦片给他滚过去一个桔子，他那柔弱的、尚未长成形的小小身躯便蹒跚地追逐着它。他一捡到它，就把它扔掉了，因为他感到桔子摸起来很奇怪。他回头看着她，皱起小脸，哭了起来。他吓坏了，因为他全身光溜溜的。","He was frightened and wanted to cry.But she, in the warm indolence of her body, and the complete indifference of her heart, and the resistance of her womb, rolled him an orange across the red tiles, and with his soft, unformed little body he toddled after it.Then, immediately he had it, he dropped it because it felt strange against his flesh.And he looked back at her, wrinkling his face to cry, frightened because he was stark."
"“把桔子给我，”她说，惊讶于自己竟然能对孩子的恐慌感有如此深的冷漠。“把桔子给妈妈。”","“Bring me the orange,” she said, amazed at her own deep indifference to his trepidation.“Bring Mummy the orange.”"
"“他不会长成他父亲那样的，”她自言自语道，“就像一只从未见过阳光的毛毛虫。”","“He shall not grow up like his father,” she said to herself.“Like a worm that the sun has never seen.”"
"第二章","CHAPTER II"
"她曾经是如此把这孩子放在心上，在责任的痛苦中煎熬，就像是，生了他，就必须得对他的整个一生负起责任来。即使他流着鼻涕，也都是那么令人厌恶，刺激着她浑身所有的器官，似乎她不得不对自己说：看看你生出来的这个东西！","She had had the child so much on her mind, in a torment of responsibility, as if, having borne him, she had to answer for his whole existence.Even if his nose were running, it had been repulsive and a goad in her vitals, as if she must say to herself: Look at the thing you brought forth!"
"现在情况变了。她不再为这孩子竭心尽力，她不再为他担心、焦虑，也不再将希望寄托在他身上。而他也会因此长得更加健壮。","Now a change took place.She was no longer vitally consumed about the child, she took the strain of her anxiety and her will from off him.And he thrived all the more for it."
"她内心思考着，想着那光辉灿烂的太阳，想着他正在融入她。如今她的生命是一个秘密的仪式。在黎明到来之前，她总是清醒地躺着，看着天空由灰色变成浅浅的金色，猜想着大海的边上是否漂着几片云彩。当太阳熔化了似的升起来，赤裸裸的，向温柔的天空放射出蓝白色的火焰时，她就感到万分喜悦。","She was thinking inside herself, of the sun in his splendour, and his entering into her.Her life was now a secret ritual.She always lay awake, before dawn, watching for the grey to colour to pale gold, to know if clouds lay on the sea’s edge.Her joy was when he rose all molten in his nakedness, and threw off blue-white fire, into the tender heaven."
"但有时候，他就像是一个大大的、害羞的家伙，满脸通红地跳出来。还有时它又慢吞吞的，一脸绛红色，像是生气似的，慢慢地推着、用肩顶着出来。还有的时候，她看不见他，只能看到当他在云墙后移动时，和他同高的云朵从上面洒下的金色和绯红的光芒。","But sometimes he came ruddy, like a big, shy creature.And sometimes slow and crimson red, with a look of anger, slowly pushing and shouldering.Sometimes again she could not see him, only the level cloud threw down gold and scarlet from above, as he moved behind the wall."
"她是幸运的。几周过去了，尽管有时黎明是多云的，有时下午天空灰蒙蒙的，但没有一天没有太阳。虽然正值冬季，但是大多数的日子都是阳光灿烂的。瘦小的野生番红花长出浅紫色条纹状的新芽，野生水仙花则开出星状的冬日之花。","She was fortunate.Weeks went by, and though the dawn was sometimes clouded, and afternoon was sometimes grey, never a day passed sunless, and most days, winter though it was, streamed radiant.The thin little wild crocuses came up mauve and striped, the wild narcissus hung their winter stars."
"每一天，她都到那棵柏树那里去，呆在土丘上的仙人掌丛中，山脚下是浅黄色的悬崖。她现在比以前更聪明、更敏感了，只披着件鸽灰色的披肩，穿着便鞋。于是，在任何一个隐秘又合适的地方，她都能马上裸身向着太阳。在她再次穿上衣服的瞬间，她便又变成灰色，不易被发现了。","Every day, she went down to the cypress tree, among the cactus grove on the knoll with yellowish cliffs at the foot.She was wiser and subtler now, wearing only a dove-grey wrap, and sandals.So that in an instant, in any hidden niche, she was naked to the sun.And the moment she was covered again she was grey and invisible."
"每一天，从早上到中午，她都躺在那棵苍劲的、有着银色树根的柏树下面，太阳则在天空中欢快地行走。此时，她感受到阳光照射进她身体里的每一个地方。她心中的焦虑，那忧愁而紧张的心情一并消失了，就像一朵在阳光中凋谢的花朵，只剩下即将成熟的小小果实。还有她那紧张的子宫，虽然仍然紧闭着，但当阳光神秘地触摸它时，它也慢慢地舒展开，就像水下的百合花蕾，慢慢地、慢慢地展开。就像水下的百合花蕾，它慢慢地向着太阳浮上来，最终，它向着太阳，只向着太阳，完全地开放了。","Every day, in the morning towards noon, she lay at the foot of the powerful, silver-pawed cypress tree, while the sun strode jovial in heaven.By now she knew the sun in every thread of her body.Her heart of anxiety, that anxious, straining heart, had disappeared altogether, like a flower that falls in the sun, and leaves only a little ripening fruit.And her tense womb, though still closed, was slowly unfolding, slowly, slowly, like a lily bud under water, as the sun mysteriously touched it.Like a lily bud under water it was slowly rising to the sun, to expand at last, to the sun, only to the sun."
"她知道太阳融进了她整个身体，那熔化了的蓝色星球，边缘燃烧着白色的火焰，放射着光芒。即使他普照大地，但当她裸身躺着的时候，他只聚焦在她的身上。这就是太阳的一个奇妙之处，他可以照射着千万众生，却仍然是专属于她一个人的、光芒四射、壮丽辉煌、独一无二的太阳。","She knew the sun in all her body, the blue-molten with his white fire edges, throwing off fire.And, though he shone on all the world, when she lay unclothed he focussed on her.It was one of the wonders of the sun, he could shine on a million people, and still be the radiant, splendid, unique sun, focussed on her alone."
"基于她对太阳的了解，基于她确信阳光正渐渐地穿透她的身体去了解她，从这个词广大无边的世俗意义上说，她有了一种超脱于人群的感觉，并对人类有一种居高临下的包容。他们是如此非自然，如此缺乏阳光。他们就像坟场里的蛆虫。","With her knowledge of the sun, and her conviction that the sun was gradually penetrating her to know her, in the cosmic carnal sense of the word, came over her a feeling of a detachment from people, and a certain contemptuous tolerance for human beings altogether.They were so un-elemental, so un-sunned.They were so like graveyard worms."
"即使是赶着驴子，走过布满岩石的、古老的羊肠小道的农夫们，虽然他们已经晒得黝黑，但是仍然没有被太阳晒透。在核心处有一小团柔软的、白色的恐惧，犹如藏在壳里的蜗牛，男人的灵魂害怕生命的自然光辉，就缩在这种恐惧里。他害怕看见太阳：总是从心底里被吓到了。所有的男人都是那样。","Even the peasants passing up the rocky, ancient little road with their donkeys, sun-blackened as they were, were not sunned right through.There was a little soft white core of fear, like a snail in a shell, where the soul of the man cowered in fear of the natural blaze of life.He dared not quite see the sun: always innerly cowed.All men were like that."
"为什么接受男人！","Why admit men!"
"带着对人类、对男人的漠视，她如今不再那么谨慎，担心被人看到了。她已经告诉玛丽尼娜，就是在村里为她买东西的那个人，说医生让她晒太阳浴。那就够了。","With her indifference to people, to men, she was not now so cautious about being seen.She had told Marinina, who went shopping for her in the village, that the doctor had ordered sun-baths.Let that suffice."
"玛丽尼娜是个六十多岁的女人，个子高高的，瘦瘦的，身板挺直。她有一头深灰色的卷发，一双深灰色的眼睛藏了几千年的精明，半嘲讽的笑容暗含着饱经沧桑的人生阅历。可悲的则是缺乏日光浴的经历。","Marinina was a woman of sixty or more, tall, thin, erect, with curling dark-grey hair, and dark-grey eyes that had the shrewdness of thousands of years in them, with the laugh, half mockery, that underlies all long experience.Tragedy is lack of experience."
"“裸身晒太阳一定是一件很美的事。”玛丽尼娜说道，她敏锐地看着那个女人，眼里闪过一丝精明的笑意。朱丽叶金色的短发如小小的云朵般卷曲在她的太阳穴两侧。玛丽尼娜来自于大希腊 ，有着悠长的回忆。她再次看着朱丽叶。","“It must be beautiful to go naked in the sun,” said Marinina, with a shrewd laugh in her eyes as she looked keenly at the other woman.Juliet’s fair, bobbed hair curled in a little cloud at her temples.Marinina was a woman of Magna Graecia, and had far memories.She looked again at Juliet."
"“可一个女人漂亮的话，她就能在阳光下展露自己的吧？嗯？不是吗？”  她补充道，带着过去的女人的那种奇怪、令人窒息的短促笑声。","“But when a woman is beautiful, she can show herself to the sun?eh?isn’t it true?” she added, with that queer, breathless little laugh of the women of the past."
"“我漂不漂亮谁知道！” 朱丽叶说道。","“Who knows if I am beautiful!” said Juliet."
"但漂亮与否，她觉得自己是被太阳欣赏着的。那便一样。","But beautiful or not, she felt that by the sun she was appreciated.Which is the same."
"中午晒过太阳，她有时候会偷偷地从岩石上爬下去，经过悬崖边，来到那深深的峡谷旁，在那儿，柠檬挂在清凉、永恒的阴影里。在寂静中她悄悄地脱掉身上的披肩，在深不见底、清澈碧绿的水池边迅速地清洗着自己。柠檬树叶下透着没有遮掩、朦胧翠绿的光芒，在这种光芒的映照下，她注意到自己的整个身体都是玫瑰色的，玫瑰色，然后变成金色。她就像是另外一个人。她就是另外一个人。","When, out of the sun at noon, sometimes she stole down over the rocks and past the cliff-edge, down to the deep gully where the lemons hung in cool eternal shadow; and in the silence slipped off her wrap to wash herself quickly at one of the deep, clear green basins, she would notice, in the bare green twilight under the lemon leaves, that all her body was rosy, rosy, and turning to gold.She was like another person.She was another person."
"她记起希腊人曾经说过，苍白而未经太阳晒过的身体是不健康、带有腥臭味的。","So she remembered that the Greeks had said a white unsunned body was unhealthy, and fishy."
"她会在皮肤上涂一些橄榄油，并在柠檬的昏暗世界里漫步片刻，让一朵柠檬花在肚脐上保持平衡，并自顾自地笑着。这样很有可能被某个农夫看见。但如果他看见了，那他一定比她更害怕。她深知，在男人裹着衣服的身躯里，有一团白色的恐惧。","And she would rub a little olive oil into her skin, and wander a moment in the dark underworld of the lemons, balancing a lemon-flower in her navel, laughing to herself.There was just a chance some peasant might see her.But if he did, he would be more afraid of her than she of him.She knew of the white core of fear in the clothed bodies of men."
"她甚至可以从她小小的儿子身上看到这一点。他是那么地不信任她，她嘲笑他，脸上洒满阳光！每天她坚持让他赤裸着在阳光下蹒跚学步。现在他的小小身躯也呈粉红色了，金发从前额往后梳着，非常浓密，脸颊的皮肤在阳光下呈现出美妙的金色，里面透着石榴红。他是漂亮而健康的，那些仆人们非常喜欢他身上的金色、红色和蓝色，把他称作是天堂来的小天使。","She knew it even in her little son.How he mistrusted her, now that she laughed at him, with the sun in her face!She insisted on his toddling naked in the sunshine, every day. And now his little body was pink too, his blond hair was pushed thick from his brow, his cheeks had a pomegranate scarlet, in the delicate gold of the sunny skin.He was bonny and healthy, and the servants, loving his gold and red and blue, called him an angel from heaven."
"可是他不信任他的妈妈：她嘲笑他。她还看见，在他皱着的眉头下面，那双大大的蓝眼睛中央，有着恐惧和疑虑，现在，她相信这在所有男人的眼睛中央都可以看见。她把那称作是“太阳恐惧症”。她的子宫向所有的男人关闭着，那些太阳恐惧症患者。","But he mistrusted his mother: she laughed at him.And she saw, in his wide blue eyes, under the little frown, that centre of fear, misgiving, which she believed was at the centre of all male eyes, now.She called it fear of the sun.And her womb stayed shut against all men, sun-fearers."
"“他害怕太阳。”她自言自语道，低头望进孩子的眼睛。","“He fears the sun,” she would say to herself, looking down into the eyes of the child."
"她看着他在太阳下摇摇晃晃、跌跌撞撞地蹒跚学步，并发出像小鸟般的叫声时，她发现，在内心深处他束缚着自己并躲避着太阳，他走得不稳，动作也不太好看。他的精神就像是缩在壳里的蜗牛，蜷缩在体内一个阴冷、潮湿的缝隙里。这让她想起孩子的父亲。她希望她能让他走出来，让他以一种不顾后果的姿态爆发出来，向太阳致敬。","And as she watched him toddling, swaying, tumbling in the sunshine, making his little bird-like noises, she saw that he held himself tight and hidden from the sun, inside himself, and his balance was clumsy, his movements a little gross.His spirit was like a snail in a shell, in a damp, cold crevice inside himself.It made her think of his father.And she wished she could make him come forth, break out in a gesture of recklessness, a salutation to the sun."
"她决定带他一起，到仙人掌包围的那棵柏树那里去。因为有刺，她不得不照看着他。但可以确信的是，在那个地方，他可以从内心深处那个小小的束缚里面走出来。那小小的由文明带来的紧张感会从他的额头间消失。","She determined to take him with her, down to the cypress tree among the cactus.She would have to watch him, because of the thorns.But surely in that place he would come forth from the little shell, deep inside him.That little civilised tension would disappear off his brow."
"她帮他铺了条毯子，坐下来。然后她脱掉披肩躺下来，注视着一只鹰在高高的蓝天上飞翔，柏树的树梢悬在上方。","She spread a rug for him and sat down.Then she slid off her wrap and lay down herself, watching a hawk high in the blue, and the tip of the cypress hanging over."
"孩子在毯子上玩着石头。当他起身跌跌撞撞地走开时，她也跟着起身了。他转过身，看着她。他的蓝眼睛里，几乎透着一种具有挑战性的、真正的男人才有的温暖目光。                                                                          他很帅，金色的白皮肤透着红扑扑的颜色。他不是真正的白。他的皮肤是暗沉的金色。","The boy played with stones on the rug.When he got up to toddle away, she got up too.He turned and looked at her.Almost, from his blue eyes, it was the challenging, warm look of the true male.And he was handsome, with the scarlet in the golden blond of his skin.He was not really white.His skin was gold-dusky."
"“亲爱的，小心刺。”她说。","“Mind the thorns, darling,” she said."
"“刺！”他用小鸟般的声音重复叫道，仍然回头看着她，像是画中的裸体丘比特，充满了怀疑。","“Thorns!” re-echoed the child, in a birdy chirp, still looking at her over his shoulder, like some naked putto in a picture, doubtful."
"“讨厌的、扎人的刺。”","“Nasty prickly thorns.”"
"“讨厌的刺！”","“Icky thorns!”"
"他穿着拖鞋摇摇晃晃地跨过石头，拉着干枯的薄荷枝。就在他快要跌倒在刺上时，她如一条蛇般快速跳向他。她甚至连自己都吓了一跳。“我真是一只野猫！”她自言自语道。","He staggered in his little sandals over the stones, pulling at the dry mint.She was quick as a serpent, leaping to him, when he was going to fall against the prickles.It surprised even herself.“What a wild cat I am, really!” she said to herself."
"只要有阳光，她每天都会带他到那棵柏树那里去。","She brought him every day, when the sun shone, to the cypress tree."
"“喂！”她说，“我们去柏树那儿。”","“Come!” she said, “Let us go to the cypress tree.”"
"如果遇到多云的天气，外面刮着干冷的北风，她就不能下去，小孩就会片刻不停地叽叽喳喳道：“柏树！柏树！”","And if there was a cloudy day, with the tramontana blowing, so that she could not go down, the child would chirp incessantly: “Cypress tree!Cypress tree!”"
"他和她一样想念那里。","He missed it as much as she did."
"那不仅仅是太阳浴。那意味着更多。在她内心深处的某种东西正慢慢舒展和放松下来，她受到了巨大的影响。她心中有一种神秘的愿望，它比她已知的意识和愿望更加深切，这种愿望把她和太阳连接在一起，阳光的溪流流淌过她全身，包围着她的子宫。她自己，她所能感知的自我，反倒是次要的，是一个次要的人，几乎就是一个旁观者。真实的朱丽叶活在身体深处那隐秘的阳光之流中，就像一条被昏暗光线环绕的河流，那暗沉的紫色环绕着她甜蜜而未开放的蓓蕾般的子宫。","It was not just taking sun-baths.It was much more than that.Something deep inside her unfolded and relaxed, and she was given to a cosmic influence.By some mysterious will inside her, deeper than her known consciousness and her known will, she was put into connection with the sun, and the stream of the sun flowed through her, round her womb.She herself, her conscious self, was secondary, a secondary person, almost an onlooker.The true Juliet lived in the dark flow of the sun within her deep body, like a river of dark rays circling, circling dark and violet round the sweet, shut bud of her womb."
"她一直是自己的主人，知道自己在干什么，并绝对服从自己的命令。现在她感到在她内心深处有一种完全不同的力量，这力量比她自己更强大，也更隐秘、更狂野，它淹没了她。现在，在这超越她自身的力量的迷惑下，她有些含糊了。","She had always been mistress of herself, aware of what she was doing, and held tense in her own command.Now she felt inside her quite another sort of power, something greater than herself, darker and more savage, the element flowing upon her.Now she was vague, in the spell of a power beyond herself."
"第三章","CHAPTER III"
"二月末突然变得很炎热。杏花在微风的轻拂下，如粉红的雪花般纷纷落下。淡紫色、丝一般的小小银莲花已经绽放，高高的日光兰含苞待放，大海如矢车菊一般蔚蓝。","The end of February was suddenly very hot.Almond blossom was falling like pink snow, in the touch of the smallest breeze.The mauve, silky little anemones were out, the asphodels tall in bud, and the sea was corn-flower blue."
"朱丽叶对一切都不再关心。现在，一天中的大部分时间，她和孩子都裸身在阳光下，这就是她所想要的一切。有时候，她会走到海边去洗澡：她常常在洒满阳光的溪谷中漫步，任何人都看不到她。有时她看到一个农夫牵着一头驴，他也看见了她。但她如此淡然而安静地带着孩子走开了；太阳不仅能治愈躯体，还能治愈灵魂，这种声望早已在人们当中广为流传，所以没有引起更多的兴奋。","Juliet had ceased to care about anything.Now, most of the day, she and the child were naked in the sun, and it was all she wanted.Sometimes she went down to the sea to bathe: often she wandered in the gullies where the sun shone in, and she was out of sight.Sometimes she saw a peasant with an ass, and he saw her.But she went so simply and quietly with her child; and the fame of the sun’s healing power, for the soul as well as for the body, had already spread among the people; so that there was no excitement."
"现在，孩子和她全身上下都已经晒成红润的棕褐色了。“我成另外一个人了。”她一边看着自己红棕色的胸部和大腿，一边对自己说。","The child and she were now both tanned with a rosy-golden tan, all over.“I am another being,” she said to herself, as she looked at her red-gold breasts and thighs."
"孩子也变成另外一个人，晒得黑黑的，有着一种特别而又安静的专注。现在他安安静静地自己玩耍着，她几乎都不需要注意他。在他独自一人的时候，他似乎不再需要她的照顾。","The child, too, was another creature, with a peculiar, quiet, sun-darkened absorption.Now he played by himself in silence, and she need hardly notice him.He seemed no longer to notice when he was alone."
"空中没有一丝风，大海呈一片青色。她坐在柏树巨大的银色树根旁，在太阳下打着瞌睡，但她的胸部却是警醒的，充满了活力。她正意识到内心深处激起的一种活力，那种活力唤醒了她内心的另一种自我。她仍然不想意识到。这种新的觉醒代表着一种新的联系，而她并不想要这样。她完全了解这巨大而冷漠的文明机器，了解与它接触意味着什么，以及想要逃避是多么困难。","There was not a breeze, and the sea was ultramarine.She sat by the great silver paw of the cypress tree, drowsed in the sun, but her breasts alert, full of sap.She was becoming aware of an activity rousing in her, an activity which would bring another self awake in her.She still did not want to be aware.The new rousing would mean a new contact, and this she did not want.She knew well enough the vast cold apparatus of civilisation, and what contact with it meant; and how difficult it was to evade."
"孩子在铺满岩石的小路上走出几码远，他绕过一株仙人掌生出的巨大枝丫。她看着他，一个真实的风中小孩，金棕色的皮肤，金黄的头发，红红的脸颊。他采集着有斑点的瓶状花朵，并把它们排成一排。他现在站得稳了，在着急的时候行动还很迅速，他就像一只专注的小动物在玩耍着。","The child had gone a few yards down the rocky path, round the great sprawling of a cactus.She had seen him, a real gold-brown infant of the winds, with burnt gold hair and red cheeks, collecting the speckled pitcher-flowers and laying them in rows.He could balance now, and was quick for his own emergencies, like an absorbed young animal playing."
"突然，她听到他叫道：看，妈妈！妈妈看！他那鸟叫般的声音里带着特殊的口气，使得她很快地靠向前。","Suddenly she heard him speaking: Look, Mummy!Mummy look!A note in his bird-like voice made her lean forward sharply."
"她的心脏停止了跳动。他越过那小小的裸露着的肩头回头看着她，松软的小手指着一条蛇，它离他有一码远，抬着头，张着嘴，那柔软的叉状舌头像一道影子似的闪烁着，发出急促的嘶嘶声。","Her heart stood still.He was looking over his naked little shoulder at her, and pointing with a loose little hand at a snake which had reared itself up a yard away from him, and was opening its mouth so that its forked, soft tongue flickered black like a shadow, uttering a short hiss."
"“看！妈妈！”","“Look!Mummy!”"
"“是，亲爱的，那是一条蛇！”传来缓慢低沉的声音。他注视着她，大大的蓝眼睛不确定是该害怕还是不害怕。她内心那种太阳带来的沉静让他有了信心。","“Yes, darling, it’s a snake!” came the slow deep voice.He looked at her, his wide blue eyes uncertain whether to be afraid or not.Some stillness of the sun in her reassured him."
"“蛇！”他像小鸟似的叫着。","“Snake!” he chirped."
"“是，亲爱的！别去摸它，它会咬人的。”","“Yes, darling!Don’t touch it, it can bite.”"
"蛇的身体已经落了下去，从刚刚盘着熟睡的地方爬走，慢慢放松它长长的、金褐色的身体，缓慢地弯曲着向岩石丛中爬去。男孩转过身，静静地观察着。接着他说道：“蛇走了！”","The snake had sunk down, and was reaching away from the coils in which it had been basking asleep, and slowly easing its long, gold-brown body into the rocks, with slow curves.The boy turned and watched it in silence.Then he said: “Snake going!”"
"“是的！让它走。它喜欢独自呆着。”","“Yes!Let it go.It likes to be alone.”"
"他仍然观察着它慢慢地放松自己的身体，然后冷漠地爬出他的视线。","He still watched the slow, easing length as the creature drew itself apathetic out of sight."
"“蛇回家了。”他说。","“Snake gone back,” he said."
"“是的，它回家了。到妈妈这里来一会。”","“Yes, it is gone back.Come to Mummy a moment.”"
"他走过来，他圆圆的、裸露着的小小身体坐在她赤裸的大腿上，她抚摸着他光亮的头发。她什么也没有说，感觉一切都过去了。太阳那种奇特而自然的力量充斥着她，如魔咒般充斥着这整个地方，这条蛇，与她和她的孩子一样，也是这个地方的一部分。","He came and sat with his plump, naked little body on her naked lap, and she smoothed his burnt, bright hair.She said nothing, feeling that everything was past.The curious careless power of the sun filled her, filled the whole place like a charm, and the snake was part of the place, along with her and the child."
"另一天，在一片橄榄树丛的干燥石墙里面，她看到了一条黑色的蛇横向爬行着。","Another day, in the dry stone wall of one of the olive terraces, she saw a black snake horizontally creeping."
"“玛丽尼娜，”她说，“我看到了一条黑色的蛇。它们有毒吗？”","“Marinina,” she said, “I saw a black snake.Are they harmful?”"
"“嗯，黑色的蛇没有毒！但是黄色的蛇有毒，是的！如果黄色的蛇咬了你的话，你就会死。但是它们会吓着我，我害怕它们，就算我看到黑色的蛇也会害怕。”","“Ah, the black snakes, no!But the yellow ones, yes!If the yellow ones bite you, you die.But they frighten me, they frighten me, even the black ones, when I see one.”"
"朱丽叶仍然和孩子一起去柏树那里。但在她坐下之前，她都会仔细地四下环顾，检查孩子有可能去到的每个地方。然后她会躺下，转身向着太阳，她棕色的、梨形的乳房向上挺立着。她对明天没有任何想法。离开花园，她就拒绝思考，她也不能写信。她会让护士来写。她躺在阳光里，但不会呆太久，因为太阳逐渐变得强烈灼人。不由自主地，那曾经紧紧的、深深沉浸在她内心深处的忧郁中的花蕾开始抬头，抬头并伸直起那弯曲的花茎，逐渐打开那隐秘的蓓蕾，放射出玫瑰般的光芒。她的子宫心醉神迷地开放着，就像一朵莲花。","Juliet still went to the cypress tree with the child.But she always looked carefully round, before she sat down, examining everywhere the child might go.Then she would lie and turn to the sun again, her tanned, pear-shaped breasts pointing up.She would take no thought for the morrow.She refused to think outside the garden, and she could not write letters.She would tell the nurse to write.So she lay in the sun, but not for long, for it was getting strong, fierce.And in spite of herself, the bud that had been tight and deep immersed in the innermost gloom of her, was rearing, rearing and straightening its curved stem, to open its dark tips and show a gleam of rose.Her womb was coming open wide with rosy ecstasy, like a lotus flower."
"第四章","CHAPTER IV"
"太阳的南边这一侧，正由春天变成夏天，阳光十分强烈。在很热的那几个小时里，她会躺在树荫下，有时甚至会下到清凉的柠檬树丛深处去。或者有时候她会走向幽暗的山谷深处，走到小峡谷的底部，朝家走去。孩子安静地跑来跑去，就像一只专注于生活的小动物。","Spring was becoming summer, in the south of the sun, and the rays were very powerful.In the hot hours she would lie in the shade of trees, or she would even go down to the depths of the cool lemon grove.Or sometimes she went in the shadowy deeps of the gullies, at the bottom of the little ravine, towards home.The child fluttered around in silence, like a young animal absorbed in life."
"一天中午，她裸露着身体在幽暗峡谷的树丛中慢慢向家走去，当她绕过一块岩石的时候，突然看见了附近农场的一个农民，他正俯身扎着一捆刚刚砍下来的柴火，他的驴子在旁边站立着。他穿着一条夏天的棉质裤子，弯着腰，臀部向着她。幽暗的山谷里万籁俱寂，非常隐蔽。她身子一阵发软，一瞬间动也不能动。那个男人有力的双肩举起那捆柴火，转身向着驴子走去。当他看见她时，吃了一惊，手足无措地呆站在那里，就好像那是一个幻象。然后他们的眼神相遇了，她感到那蓝色的火焰从她的四肢传到她的子宫，在抑制不住的狂喜中四处蔓延。他们仍然看着彼此的眼睛，火焰在他们之间流动着，就像从太阳中心发散出来的蓝色流火。她发现他衣服下面的阴茎鼓了起来，知道他会走向她。","Going slowly home in her nakedness down among the bushes of the dark ravine, one noon, she came round a rock suddenly upon the peasant of the next podere, who was stooping binding up a bundle of brush-wood he had cut, his ass standing near.He was wearing summer cotton trousers, and stooping his buttocks towards her.It was utterly still and private down in the dark bed of the little ravine.A weakness came over her, for a moment she could not move.The man lifted the bundle of wood with powerful shoulders, and turned to the ass.He started and stood transfixed as he saw her, as if it were a vision.Then his eyes met hers, and she felt the blue fire running through her limbs to her womb, which was spreading in the helpless ecstasy.Still they looked into each other’s eyes, and the fire flowed between them, like the blue, streaming fire from the heart of the sun.And she saw the phallus rise under his clothing, and knew he would come towards her."
"“妈妈，一个男人！妈妈！”孩子用手抓着她的大腿。“妈妈，一个男人！”","“Mummy, a man!Mummy!”The child had put a hand against her thigh.“Mummy, a man!”"
"她听见声音里的惊恐，迅速地转过身。","She heard the note of fear and swung round."
"“没事的，孩子！”她说，伸手拉住他，她领他往回走，又绕过岩石。那个农民注视着她裸露的臀部一起一伏，消失在视线中。","“It’s all right, boy!” she said, and taking him by the hand, she led him back round the rock again, while the peasant watched her naked, retreating buttocks lift and fall."
"她穿上披肩，把孩子抱在怀里，踉踉跄跄地爬上陡峭的羊肠小道，穿过长满黄色花朵的灌木丛，走到太阳地里，一直到走回房子下面的橄榄树那儿。这时，她才坐下，使自己镇定下来。","She put on her wrap, and taking the boy in her arms, began to stagger up a steep goat-track through the yellow-flowering tangle of shrubs, up to the level of day, and the olive trees below the house.There she sat down to collect herself."
"大海一片蔚蓝，十分之蓝，温柔而又平静。她的子宫大大地打开，就如同盛开的莲花，又如同仙人掌的花蕊，急切而幸福地开放。她能感受得到它，而它也控制了她的意识。一股对孩子、对复杂挫败感的懊悔情绪啃啮着她，在她的胸中燃烧。","The sea was blue, very blue and soft and still-looking, and her womb inside her was wide open, wide open like a lotus flower, or a cactus flower, in a radiant sort of eagerness.She could feel it, and it dominated her consciousness.And a biting chagrin burned in her breast, against the child, against the complication of frustration."
"她认识那个刚碰见的农夫：他三十多岁，肩膀宽阔，体格强壮。她很多次从家里的台阶边看见他：看着他和他的驴子一起走来，看着他修剪橄榄树，他独自一人工作，总是一个人。他强壮有力，有着宽阔红润的脸庞，泰然自若。她曾经和他交谈过一两次，看着他蓝色的大眼睛。他的眼睛很深邃，有着南方式的火热。她知道他一些突然的手势，有一点粗鲁，一些野蛮。但她从未想到过他。除了注意到他总是干干净净、被照顾得很好之外，有一天她看见他的妻子给丈夫送来午饭，他们坐在角豆树的树荫下，铺了一块白布，一人坐一边。朱丽叶注意到那个男人的妻子年龄比他大，是一个黑黑的、自满的、有些阴郁的女人。后来，一个年轻女人带来了一个孩子，男人就和孩子一起跳舞，是那么青春而充满了活力。                但那不是他自己的小孩：他没有孩子。当他和孩子一起跳舞的时候，那么地生机勃勃，似乎充满了被压抑的激情，那是朱丽叶第一次真正注意到他。但就是在那时，她也不曾对他有任何想法。那样宽阔红润的脸庞，那么宽广的胸膛，还有很短的腿。这个农民太像是一头粗鲁的野兽，以至于她无法幻想他。","She knew the peasant by sight: a man something over thirty, broad and very powerfully set.She had many times watched him from the terrace of her house: watched him come with his ass, watched him trimming the olive trees, working alone, always alone and physically powerful, with a broad red face and a quiet self-possession.She had spoken to him once or twice, and met his big blue eyes, dark and southern hot.And she knew his sudden gestures, a little violent and over-generous.But she had never thought of him.Save she had noticed that he was always very clean and well-cared for: and then she had seen his wife one day, when the latter had brought the man’s meal, and they sat in the shade of a carob tree, on either side the spread white cloth.And then Juliet had seen that the man’s wife was older than he, a dark, proud, gloomy woman.And then a young woman had come with a child, and the man had danced with the child, so young and passionate.But it was not his own child: he had no children.It was when he danced with the child, in such a sprightly way, as if full of suppressed passion, that Juliet had first really noticed him.But even then, she had never thought of him.Such a broad red face, such a great chest, and rather short legs.Too much a crude beast for her to think of, a peasant."
"但现在，他那奇怪的充满了挑战的眼神攫住了她，那蓝色的眼神压倒一切，就像是蓝色太阳的心脏。她曾看到他那薄薄的裤子下的生殖器异常激动：那是为了她。他红色的脸庞，他强壮的身体，对她而言就像是太阳，充满炽热的太阳。","But now the strange challenge of his eyes had held her, blue and overwhelming like the blue sun’s heart.And she had seen the fierce stirring of the phallus under his thin trousers: for her.And with his red face, and with his broad body, he was like the sun to her, the sun in its broad heat."
"她如此强烈地感受到他，她再也不能离他更远了。","She felt him so powerfully, that she could not go further from him."
"她继续在树下坐着。然后她听到护士在屋里摇着铃铛召唤着她回去。孩子应声回答了。她不得不站起身回家。","She continued to sit there under the tree.Then she heard nurse tinkling a bell at the house and calling.And the child called back.She had to rise and go home."
"下午，她坐在屋子的台阶上，从那个位置能越过橄榄树的斜坡，看着大海。那个男人来来去去，在他农场里的小木屋边走来走去，在仙人掌丛林的边缘来回穿梭。他不时瞥一眼她的房子，瞥一眼坐在台阶上的她。她的子宫向他开放了。","In the afternoon she sat on the terrace of her house, that looked over the olive slopes to the sea.The man came and went, came and went to the little hut on his podere, on the edge of the cactus grove.And he glanced again at her house, at her sitting on the terrace.And her womb was open to him."
"但她没有勇气朝他走过去。她动弹不得。她喝着茶，仍然坐在台阶上。那个男人来回穿梭，一遍一遍地瞥向她。直到村口嘉布遣会的夜钟声响起，夜幕降临了。她仍然坐在台阶上。直到最后她看见他在月光下给驴子装上货物，再遗憾地把它赶上那条羊肠小道。她听见他路过她房子时，踩着屋后那条路上的石子。他走了——回到村里他的家，和他的妻子共眠，共眠，他的妻子会疑惑他为什么会晚归。他在沮丧中离开了。","Yet she had not the courage to go down to him.She was paralysed.She had tea, and still sat there on the terrace.And the man came and went, and glanced, and glanced again.Till the evening bell had jangled from the capuchin church at the village gate, and the darkness came on.And still she sat on the terrace.Till at last in the moonlight she saw him load his ass and drive it sadly along the path to the little road.She heard him pass on the stones of the road behind her house.He was gone—gone home to the village, to sleep, to sleep with his wife, who would want to know why he was so late.He was gone in dejection."
"朱丽叶一直坐到深夜，注视着海面上的月亮。太阳已经开启了她的子宫，她不再自由了。盛开的莲花给她带来麻烦，现在是她没有勇气去跨越那道山谷了。","Juliet sat late on into the night, watching the moon on the sea.The sun had opened her womb, and she was no longer free.The trouble of the open lotus blossom had come upon her, and now it was she who had not the courage to take the steps across the gully."
"最后她还是睡着了。早上她感觉好多了。她的子宫似乎又再次关闭：那朵莲花又退回到花蕾的状态。她想真应该这样。只有沉浸在水中的花蕾，和太阳！她不会再想起那个男人了。","But at last she slept.And in the morning she felt better.Her womb seemed to have closed again: the lotus flower seemed back in bud again.She wanted so much that it should be so.Only the immersed bud, and the sun!She would never think of that man."
"她在柠檬树丛下的一个大水池中沐浴，在深深的山谷中，尽可能地远离那个野蛮而冰冷的溪谷。柠檬树下，孩子在长满了黄色醡浆草花朵的树荫下跌跌撞撞地走着，采集着落下的柠檬，光线在他棕褐色的身上留下斑驳的影子，他就带着这些斑点到处走着。她晒着太阳，坐在山谷陡峭的边缘上，感到几乎又重获了自由。幽暗的花蕾低垂着，在她的身体里很安全。","She bathed in one of the great tanks away down in the lemon-grove, down in the far ravine, far as possible from the other wild gully, and cool.Below, under the lemons, the child was wading among the yellow oxalis flowers of the shadow, gathering fallen lemons, passing with his tanned little body into flecks of light, moving all dappled.She sat in the sun on the steep bank in the gully, feeling almost free again, the flower drooping in shadowy bud, safe inside her."
"突然，在山谷边缘的上空，在那明亮的浅蓝色的天空中，玛丽尼娜出现了。她用一块黑色的布包着头，轻轻地叫道：西格诺拉！西格诺拉·古丽塔！","Suddenly, high over the land’s edge, against the full-lit pale blue sky, Marinina appeared, a black cloth tied round her head, calling quietly: Signora!Signora Giulietta!"
"朱丽叶站起身来，转过头去。玛丽尼娜愣了一会，看着这个裸体女人警觉地站在那里，她被太阳晒褪色的头发似云朵般蓬松卷曲着。接着这个敏捷的老女人沿着又斜又陡的、有阳光照耀的小路走下来。","Juliet faced round, standing up.Marinina paused a moment, seeing the naked woman standing alert, her sun-faded hair in a little cloud.Then the swift old woman came down the slant of the steep, sun-blazed track."
"她在离这个有着太阳般肤色的女人几步之远的时候停住脚步，直直地在她面前站立着，精明地打量着她。","She stood a few steps, erect, in front of the sun-coloured woman, and eyed her shrewdly."
"“你可真是美呀，你！”她冷冷地说道，几乎带着点嘲讽。“你丈夫来了。”","“But how beautiful you are, you!” she said coolly, almost cynically.“Your husband has come.”"
"“什么丈夫？”朱丽叶大声叫道。","“What husband?” cried Juliet."
"那个老女人精明地格格笑了几声，带着过去的女人的那种嘲讽。","The old woman gave a shrewd bark of a little laugh, the mockery of the woman of the past."
"“难道你没有丈夫吗？”她奚落道。","“Haven’t you got one, a husband, you?” she said, taunting."
"“怎么可能？哪儿？在美国呢。”朱丽叶说。","“How?Where?In America,” said Juliet."
"老女人扭头扫视着她，无声地笑着。","The old woman glanced over her shoulder, with another noiseless laugh."
"“根本不是在美国。他跟着我到这儿来了。要不然他就会迷路的。”她往后一甩头，带着女人的无声的笑。","“No America at all.He was following me here.He will have missed the path.”And she threw back her head in the noiseless laugh of women."
"这些小路上长满了高高的青草、鲜花和风轮菜，就像是一片永远荒芜的野地里小鸟留下的条条印迹。奇怪的是，这片古老经典而又鲜艳醒目的荒原在很久前就了解人类了。","The paths were all grown high with grass and flowers and nepitella, till they were like bird-tracks in an eternally wild place.Strange, the vivid wildness of the old classic places, that have known men so long."
"朱丽叶沉思的双眼打量着这个来自西西里岛的女人。","Juliet looked at the Sicilian woman with meditating eyes."
"“喔，很好，”她终于说道，“让他过来。”","“Oh very well,” she said at last.“Let him come.”"
"一团小小的火焰在她身体中升起。就是那朵盛开的花。至少他是个男人。","And a little flame leaped in her.It was the opening flower.At least he was a man."
"“带他到这儿？现在？”玛丽尼娜问道，她那烟灰色的眼睛带着嘲笑直盯着朱丽叶的眼睛。接着她又耸了耸肩。","“Bring him here?Now?” asked Marinina, her mocking, smoke-grey eyes looking with laughter into Juliet’s eyes.Then she gave a little jerk of her shoulders."
"“好吧！随你便！这对他而言可是件稀罕事！”她张开嘴，愉悦地无声笑着，接着她指着小孩，他正在自己小小的胸膛上堆柠檬。“看这孩子多漂亮！简直是天使！可怜的家伙，那一定会让他感到开心的。那我带他过来？”","“All right!As you wish!But for him it is a rare one!”She opened her mouth with a noiseless laugh of amusement then she pointed down to the child, who was heaping lemons against his little chest.“Look how beautiful the child is!An angel from heaven!That certainly will please him, poor thing.Then I shall bring him?”"
"“带他过来。”朱丽叶说。","“Bring him,” said Juliet."
"这个老女人又快速地爬上那条小径，看见莫里斯不知所措地站在长满藤蔓的台阶上，戴着一顶灰色的毛毡帽子，穿着一套深灰色的城市派头的西装。在灿烂的阳光下，在古希腊优雅的氛围里，他看上去很可怜，和这个地方格格不入，就像掉在苍白的、洒满阳光的斜坡上的一滴墨水。","The old woman scrambled rapidly up the track again, and found Maurice at a loss among the vine terraces, standing there in his grey felt hat and dark-grey city suit.He looked pathetically out of place, in that resplendent sunshine and the grace of the old Greek world; like a blot of ink on the pale, sun-glowing slope."
"“过来！”玛丽尼娜对他说，“她在下面。”","“Come!” said Marinina to him.“She is down here.”"
"她领着路，敏捷地迈着大步穿过草丛向前走。突然间，她在陡坡的顶端停了下来。下面的柠檬树的树梢很幽暗。","And swiftly she led the way, striding with a long stride, marking the way through the grasses.Suddenly she stopped on the brow of the slope.The tops of the lemon trees were dark, away below."
"“你，你从这儿下去。”她对他说。他很快地抬头看着她，并向她致谢。","“You, you go down here,” she said to him, and he thanked her, glancing up at her swiftly."
"他四十多岁，胡子刮得干干净净，脸色灰灰的，显得很沉静，也确实很害羞。他认真地经营着自己的事业，虽没有惊人的成功，却也颇有成效。他不信任何人。这个来自大希腊的老女人扫了他一眼，自言自语地说：他是个好人，但不是个男人，可怜的家伙。","He was a man of forty, clean-shaven, grey-faced, very quiet and really shy.He managed his own business carefully without startling success, but efficiently.And he confided in nobody.The old woman of Magna Graecia saw him at a glance: he is good, she said to herself, but not a man, poor thing."
"玛丽尼娜说：“西格诺娜在下面。”她像一位命运之神一样指着那儿。","“Down there is the Signora,” said Marinina, pointing like one of the Fates."
"他再次说道：“谢谢！谢谢！”他说道，眼睛亮都没亮一下，小心地走上那条小路。玛丽尼娜带着一丝邪恶的快意，抬起下巴。然后她大步地朝房子走去。","And again he said, “Thank you!Thank you!” without a twinkle, and stepped carefully into the track.Marinina lifted her chin with a joyful wickedness.Then she strode off towards the house."
"莫里斯小心翼翼地走着，穿过地中海乱蓬蓬的杂草，直到他来到一个拐弯处，和他妻子离得非常近了，他才看到她。她裸身笔直地站在突起的岩石边，和太阳一起闪耀，和温暖的生活一起发光。她的胸部高高挺立着，警醒着，似乎在聆听着；她的大腿呈现出棕色，而且看上去很敏捷。在她身体里面，她的子宫如同莲花般盛开，在太阳紫色的光线下如同一朵大大的莲花般裂开。她无法抑制地兴奋着：一个男人过来了。他战战兢兢地走过来，就像吸墨纸上的一滴墨水，她快速而紧张地扫了他一眼。","Maurice was watching his step, through the tangle of Mediterranean herbage, so he did not catch sight of his wife till he came round a little bend, quite near her.She was standing erect and nude by the jutting rock, glistening with the sun and with warm life.Her breasts seemed to be lifting up, alert, to listen, her thighs looked brown and fleet.Inside her, the lotus of her womb was wide open, spread almost gaping in the violet rays of the sun, like a great lotus flower.And she thrilled helplessly: a man was coming.Her glance on him, as he came gingerly, like ink on blotting-paper, was swift and nervous."
"莫里斯，可怜的家伙，迟疑着，把眼光从她身上移开，脸转向一边。","Maurice, poor fellow, hesitated and glanced away from her, turning his face aside."
"“嗨，朱莉！”他叫道，有些紧张地咳嗽了一声。“太漂亮了！太美了！”","“Hello, Julie!” he said, with a little nervous cough.“Splendid!Splendid!”"
"他把脸转向一边向前走去，却私下远远地瞥着她。她站在那儿，太阳那独特的柔滑的光辉照在她棕色的皮肤上。不知怎的，她看上去并没有那么裸露。太阳那金灿灿的玫瑰色的光辉笼罩着她。","He advanced with his face averted, shooting further glances at her, furtively, as she stood with the peculiar satiny gleam of the sun on her tanned skin.Somehow she did not seem so terribly naked.It was the golden-rose of the sun that clothed her."
"“嗨，莫里斯！”她说道，退缩了一下，一片阴影笼罩在她子宫盛开的花朵上。“我没想到你这么快就到了。”","“Hello Maurice!” she said, hanging back from him, and a cold shadow falling on the open flower of her womb.“I wasn’t expecting you so soon.”"
"“是的，”他说，“是的！我设法提前点溜走了。”","“No,” he said.“No!I managed to slip away a little earlier.”"
"接着他又无意识地咳嗽起来。他偷偷摸摸地故意使她吃惊。他们站得有几码远，两人间一阵沉默。对他而言，这是一个全新的朱莉，有着被太阳晒黑、被风抚摸过的双腿，不再是那个神经质的纽约女人了。","And again he coughed unawares.Furtively, purposely he had taken her by surprise.They stood several yards away from one another, and there was silence.But this was a new Julie to him, with the suntanned, wind-stroked thighs: not that nervous New York woman."
"“啊！”他说，“嗯——真是太美了——太美了！你真——嗯——漂亮！——孩子在哪儿？”","“Well!” he said, “er—this is splendid—splendid!You are—er—splendid!—Where is the boy?”"
"他在内心深处感觉到，有种欲望刺激着他，是这女人的肢体和披满阳光的肉体：女人的身体。这是他生命中新的欲望，这欲望刺痛了他。他想转移注意力。","He felt, in his far-off depths, the desire stirring in him for the limbs and sun-wrapped flesh of the woman: the woman of flesh.It was a new desire in his life, and it hurt him.He wanted to side-track."
"“他在那儿，”她一边说一边向下指着一个裸体的小淘气鬼，他正在那深深的树荫下把掉落的柠檬堆积起来。","“There he is,” she said, pointing down to where a naked urchin in the deep shade was piling fallen lemons together."
"父亲发出一声奇怪的轻笑，几乎像马嘶一样。","The father gave an odd little laugh, almost neighing."
"“啊！是的！他在那儿！就是那小东西！真好！”他紧张压抑的精神异常激动起来，牢牢地抓住自己的表意识。“嗨，约翰尼！”他召唤着他，声音听起来相当无力。“嗨，约翰尼！”","“Ah!yes!There he is!So there’s the little man!Fine!”His nervous, suppressed soul was thrilling with violent thrills, he clung to the straw of his upper consciousness.“Hello, Johnny!” he called, and it sounded rather feeble.“Hello Johnny!”"
"孩子朝上面看去，柠檬从他胖乎乎的胳膊中滑落，但他并没有回答。","The child looked up, spilling lemons from his chubby arms, but did not respond."
"“我想我们应该到他那儿去。”朱丽叶说着，转身大踏步地向那条路上走去。阴影正不由自主地离开她的子宫，这朵盛开的花，每一片花瓣都重新激动地战栗起来。她的丈夫跟随着她，看着她的腰肢轻轻摇摆时，那红润结实的臀部快速地一起一伏。他爱她爱得头晕目眩了，但仍然不知所措。他习惯于她作为一个人。但现在她不仅仅只是一个人了，而是一个敏锐、阳光的身体，她如同希腊神话中的仙女，没有灵魂，勾人魂魄，摇晃着她的臀部。他该拿自己怎么办？他和这幅画面格格不入，他穿着深灰色的西装，戴着浅灰色的帽子，他是一个害羞的商人，有着一张灰色的修道士般的脸孔，以及阴暗的商人的思想。一种奇怪的冲动穿过他的腰和大腿。他吓坏了，他感到他或许应该发出一阵狂野的胜利的欢呼声，然后扑向那个晒黑了的女人的身体。","“I guess we’ll go down to him,” said Juliet, as she turned and went striding down the path.In spite of herself, the cold shadow was lifting off the open flower of her womb, and every petal was thrilling again.Her husband followed, watching the rosy, fleet-looking lifting and sinking of her quick hips, as she swayed a little in the socket of her waist.He was dazed with admiration, but also at a deadly loss.He was used to her as a person.And this was no longer a person, but a fleet sun-strong body, soulless and alluring as a nymph, twinkling its haunches.What would he do with himself?He was utterly out of the picture, in his dark grey suit and pale grey hat, and his grey, monastic face of a shy business man, and his grey mercantile mentality.Strange thrills shot through his loins and his legs.He was terrified, and he felt he might give a wild whoop of triumph, and jump towards that woman of tanned flesh."
"“他看起来不错，对吧。”朱丽叶说，他们穿过黄色醡浆草的海洋，来到柠檬树下。","“He looks all right, doesn’t he,” said Juliet, as they came through the deep sea of yellow-flowering oxalis, under the lemon-trees."
"“啊！——是的！是的！太好了！太好了！——嗨，约翰尼！你还认识爸爸吗？你还认识爸爸吗，约翰尼？”","“Ah!—yes!yes!Splendid!Splendid!—Hello Johnny!Do you know Daddy?Do you know Daddy, Johnny?”"
"他蹲下，忘了会把他的裤子弄皱，并伸出手来。","He squatted down, forgetting his trouser-crease, and held out his hands."
"“柠檬！”孩子像小鸟般地叫道，“两个柠檬！”","“Lemons!” said the child, birdily chirping.“Two lemons!”"
"“两个柠檬！”父亲回答道，“很多柠檬！”","“Two lemons!” replied the father.“Lots of lemons!”"
"小孩走过来，向他父亲摊开的双手上各放了一个柠檬。然后他退后看着。","The infant came and put a lemon in each of his father’s open hands.Then he stood back to look."
"“两个柠檬！”父亲重复道，“快来，约翰尼！快过来，和爸爸打个招呼！”","“Two lemons!” repeated the father.“Come, Johnny!Come and say Hello! to Daddy.”"
"“爸爸回去吗？”孩子说。","“Daddy going back?” said the child."
"“回去？嗯——喔——今天不回。”","“Going back?Well—well—not today.”"
"他把孩子抱在怀里。","And he took his son in his arms."
"“把衣服脱下来！爸爸，把衣服脱下来！”孩子说道，快活地扭动着，想蹭开衣服。","“Take a coat off!Daddy take a coat off!” said the boy, squirming debonair away from the cloth."
"“好的，儿子！爸爸把衣服脱下来。”","“All right, son!Daddy take a coat off.”"
"他脱下外套，仔细地把它放在一旁，看着裤子上的褶皱，把它们掸平，然后蹲下身，把儿子抱在怀里。孩子温暖裸露的身体靠着他，让他觉得晕眩。裸体的女人低头看着穿着衬衫的男人怀里被晒得红彤彤的幼儿。孩子已经扯下了他父亲的帽子，朱丽叶看着她丈夫花白的头发，油光滑亮，一丝不乱。但是却完全、完全缺乏阳光！冰冷的阴影又重新覆盖了她的子宫之花。小孩子很喜欢他的爸爸，但当爸爸和孩子交谈时，她很长一段时间都没有出声。","He took off his coat and laid it carefully aside, then looked at the creases in his trousers, hitched them a little, and crouched down and took his son in his arms.The child’s warm naked body against him made him feel faint.The naked woman looked down at the rosy infant in the arms of the man in his shirt-sleeves.The boy had pulled off his father’s hat, and Juliet looked at the sleek black-and-grey hair of her husband, not a hair out of place.And utterly, utterly sunless!The cold shadow was over the flower of her womb again.She was silent for a long time, while the father talked to the child, who had been fond of his Daddy."
"“你打算怎么办，莫里斯？”她突然说道。听见这意料之外的美国式语调，他很快地侧过头看着她。他已经忽略了她。","“What are you going to do about it, Maurice?” she said suddenly.He looked at her swiftly, sideways, hearing her abrupt American voice.He had forgotten her."
"“嗯——关于什么，朱莉？”","“Er—about what, Julie?”"
"“喔，任何事情！关于这件事！我不能回到东区四十七号。”","“Oh, everything!About this!I can’t go back into East Forty-Seventh.”"
"“嗯——”他犹豫道，“是的，我想是，至少不是现在。”","“Er—” he hesitated, “no, I suppose not—Not just now, at least.”"
"“永远都不回去！”她突然打断他，接着便是一阵沉默。","“Never!” she said abruptly, and there was a silence."
"“嗯——呃——我不知道。”他说。","“Well—er—I don’t know,” he said."
"“你觉得你能到这儿来吗？”她粗鲁地说。","“Do you think you can come out here?” she said savagely."
"“是的！——我能在这里呆上一个月。我想我可以在这里呆一个月。”他迟疑地说道。然后他壮着胆子用一种复杂的、害羞的眼神偷看着她，接着又把脸转向一边。","“Yes!—I can stay for a month.I think I can manage a month,” he hesitated.Then he ventured a complicated, shy peep at her, and turned away his face again."
"她低头看着他，她那充满活力的胸部因叹息而上下起伏着，好像要迫不及待地甩掉她身上那没有阳光的冰冷阴影。","She looked down at him, her alert breasts lifted with a sigh, as if she would impatiently shake the cold shadow of sunlessness off her."
"“我不会回去，”她缓慢地说道，“在这样的阳光下，我不能回去。如果你不能到这儿来——”","“I can’t go back,” she said slowly, “I can’t go back on this sun.If you can’t come here—”"
"她打住了，语气很明确。但那个鲁莽的、爱攻击别人的美国女人的声音已经消失了，他听到的是一个充满了情欲的、在太阳下成熟了的女人的声音。他一次次地扫视着她，带着不断增长的欲望和逐渐减少的恐惧。","She ended on an open note.But the voice of the abrupt, personal American woman had died out, and he heard the voice of the woman of flesh, the sun-ripe body.He glanced at her again and again, with growing desire and lessening fear."
"“好的！”他说，“这儿的一切很适合你。你很美。——是的，我认为你不应该回去。”","“No!” he said.“This kind of thing suits you.You are splendid.—No, I don’t think you can go back.”"
"在他爱抚的声音下，她的子宫不由自主地如花朵般开放，每一片花瓣都欣喜若狂。","And at the caressive sound of his voice, in spite of her, her womb-flower began to open and thrill its petals."
"他胡思乱想到在纽约的公寓里的她，苍白，沉静，令他感到可怕的压抑。在与人的交往中，他是文雅而羞涩的，但自从她生了孩子之后，她那死寂的、可怕的敌意把他吓坏了。因为他意识到她是不由自主的。女人都像那样。她们的感情彻底转变了，甚至和她们的自我背道而驰，这是非常可怕的——具有毁灭性的。和一个那个样子、感情逆转甚至与自己对立的女人生活在一所房子里，是多么多么地可怕。他感觉她那汹涌澎湃的敌意都快将他烧毁了。她甚至折磨自己，触自己的痛处，也折磨着孩子。不，远远不止如此。谢天谢地，那个邪恶如魔鬼般的女人在太阳的照耀下已经从她体内消失了。","He was thinking visionarily of her in the New York flat, pale, silent, oppressing him terribly.He was the soul of gentle timidity in his human relations, and her silent, awful hostility after the baby was born had frightened him deeply.Because he had realized that she could not help it.Women were like that.Their feelings took a reverse direction, even against their own selves, and it was awful—devastating.Awful, awful to live in the house with a woman like that, whose feelings were reversed even against herself.He had felt himself borne down under the stream of her heavy hostility.She had ground even herself down to the quick, and the child as well.No, anything rather than that.Thank God, that menacing ghost-woman seemed to be sunned out of her now."
"“但你怎么办？”她问。","“But what about you?” she asked."
"“我？喔，我！——我可以一边做着生意，一边——嗯，到这儿来度长假——只要你愿意呆在这里。你可以随便呆多久——”他很长时间都看着地面。他害怕唤起她体内那个邪恶的、充满复仇情绪的女人，他多么希望她就是现在他看到的这个样子，就像一颗裸露的、熟透了的草莓，一个水果般的女人。他抬头看着她，在他不安的眼神里有一丝祈求。","“I?Oh, I!—I can carry on in the business, and—er come over here for long holidays—so long as you like to stay here.You stay as long as you wish—” He looked down a long time at the earth.He was so frightened of rousing that menacing, avenging spirit of womanhood in her, he did so hope she might stay as he had seen her now, like a naked, ripening strawberry, a female like a fruit.He glanced up at her with a touch of supplication in his uneasy eyes."
"“甚至是永远？”她说。","“Even for ever?” she said."
"“啊——嗯——是的，如果你愿意。永远太长了。没有人可以确定日期。”","“Well—er—yes, if you like.For ever is a long time.One can’t set a date.”"
"“我可以做任何我喜欢做的事情吗？”她挑战似的直视他的眼睛。面对她玫瑰色的、在风的吹拂下变得健壮的裸露身体，他显得那么无力。他害怕唤醒她身体里面的另一个女人，那个爱攻击别人、具有报复性的、如鬼魅般的美国女人。","“And can I do anything I like?”She looked him straight in the eyes, challenging.And he was powerless against her rosy, wind-hardened nakedness, in his fear of arousing that other woman in her, the personal American woman, spectral and vengeful."
"“呃——是的——我认为是的！只要你不再让自己不高兴——或者让孩子不高兴。”","“Er—yes!—I suppose so!So long as you don’t make yourself unhappy—or the boy.”"
"他再次抬头看着她，带着复杂而不安的恳求——想到了孩子，但更多是为他自己。","Again he looked up at her with a complicated, uneasy appeal—thinking of the child, but hoping for himself."
"“我不会。”她很快回答。","“I won’t,” she said quickly."
"“是的！”他说，“是的！我想你不会。”","“No!” he said, “No!I don’t think you will.”"
"一阵短暂的沉默。村里午时的钟声急促地响起。午饭时间到了。","There was a pause.The bells of the village were hastily clanging mid-day.That meant lunch."
"她披上她灰色的和服式的纱质晨衣，在腰间系了一根宽宽的绿色腰带。她又给孩子套上一件小小的蓝色T恤，然后他们朝房子走去。","She slipped into her grey crêpe kimono, and fastened a broad green sash around her waist.Then she slipped a little blue shirt over the boy’s head, and they went up to the house."
"在餐桌上，她观察她的丈夫，那灰色的带有城市印迹的脸庞，服帖而灰白的头发，他非常周到的餐桌礼仪，以及他在用餐时极为讲究的吃喝适度。他有时会从那黑黑的睫毛下偷偷瞟她几眼。他有着一双不安的、金褐色的眼睛，就像很小就被逮到的动物，完全在圈养中长大，眼神陌生而冷淡，不知有温暖的希望。只有他黑色的眉毛和睫毛看起来很不错。她不接受他。她没有意识到他。沐浴在阳光下，她看不到他，他全身缺乏阳光，就像一个不存在的人。","At table she watched her husband, his grey city face, his glued, grey-black hair, his very precise table manners, and his extreme moderation in eating and drinking.Sometimes he glanced at her furtively, from under his black lashes.He had the uneasy, gold-grey eyes of a creature that has been caught young, and reared entirely in captivity, strange and cold, knowing no warm hopes.Only his black eye-brows and eye-lashes were nice.She did not take him in.She did not realize him.Being so sunned, she could not see him, his sunlessness was like nonentity."
"他们走到阳台上，在一大片玫瑰色的九重葛下喝着咖啡。下面不远处，隔壁的农场上，那个农夫和他的妻子坐在角豆树下，高高的绿色麦田旁边，地上铺着一小块白布，他们面对面坐着。还剩下一大块面包——但他们已经吃完了，坐在那儿，杯里还有些深色的红酒。","They went on to the balcony for coffee, under the rosy mass of the bougainvillea.Below, beyond, on the next podere, the peasant and his wife were sitting under the carob tree, near the tall green wheat, sitting facing one another across a little white cloth spread on the ground.There was still a huge piece of bread—but they had finished eating and sat with dark wine in their glasses."
"这对美国人一出现，那个农夫就抬头朝阳台上望来。朱丽叶让她的丈夫背对他们坐着。然后她坐下，回头看着农夫。直到她看到他那黑脸妻子也转过头来看着。","The peasant looked up at the terrace, as soon as the American emerged.Juliet put her husband with his back to the scene.Then she sat down, and looked back at the peasant.Until she saw his dark-visaged wife turn to look too."
"第五章","CHAPTER V"
"这个男人无望地爱着她。                                她看着他宽阔而非常短的红色脸庞，他直直地盯着她，直到他的妻子也转过头来看，他才拿起杯子，一口喝下杯里的红酒。他的妻子很长时间都盯着阳台上的这两个人。她长得清秀，却相当忧郁，而且肯定比她丈夫大，在这个优越而高傲的四十多岁女人和她的没有责任感的三十五岁左右的丈夫之间，存在着巨大的差异。看起来像是整整一代人的差距。“他和我是一代人，”朱丽叶想，“而她和莫里斯是一代人。”朱丽叶还不到三十岁。","The man was hopelessly in love with her.She saw his broad, rather short red face gazing up at her fixedly: till his wife turned too to look, then he picked up his glass and tossed the wine down his throat.The wife stared long at the figures on the balcony.She was handsome and rather gloomy, and surely older than he, with that great difference that lies between a rather overwhelming, superior woman over forty, and her more irresponsible husband of thirty-five or so.It seemed like the difference of a whole generation.“He is my generation,” thought Juliet, “and she is Maurice’s generation.”Juliet was not yet thirty."
"农夫穿着白色的棉质裤子和淡粉色的衬衫，戴着一顶磨损了的旧草帽，看起来是那么迷人，那么干净，充满了健康的洁净。他很强壮结实，看起来有点矮，但是他的肌肉充满了活力，就好像他随时准备好要跳起来活动、工作，甚至玩耍，就如她以前看到他和孩子在一起时那样。他是意大利式的农民，他想要奉献他自己，迫切地想要奉献自己，奉献他那强壮有力的肌肉和重重的心跳。但他也是一个纯粹的农民，所以他才会等着女人主动行动。他宁愿长时间地在这强烈的、被动的欲望中徘徊，渴望着，渴望女人主动来找他。但他不会试着走向那女人，永远不会。她得迈出这一步。他只会在咫尺之间徘徊着。","The peasant in his white cotton trousers and pale pink shirt, and battered old straw hat, was attractive, so clean, and full of the cleanliness of health.He was stout and broad, and seemed shortish, but his flesh was full of vitality, as if he were always about to spring up into movement, to work, even, as she had seen him with the child, to play.He was the type of Italian peasant that wants to make an offering of himself, passionately wants to make an offering of himself, of his powerful flesh and thudding blood-stroke.But he was also completely a peasant, in that he would wait for the woman to make the move.He would hang round in a long, consuming passivity of desire, hoping, hoping for the woman to come for him.But he would never try to advance to her: never.She would have to make the advance.Only he would hang round, within reach."
"感到她在看着自己，他扔掉他的旧草帽，露出他圆圆的、头发修剪得短短的棕色脑袋，伸出他那棕红色的大手去拿那一大片面包，他撕下一块，鼓着腮帮咀嚼起来。他知道她正看着自己。她对他有着如此强大的吸引力，他就像是一头激动的、不能说话的动物，那么地热血沸腾！他在阳光无尽的照耀下热血翻滚，如同中午一样昏头昏脑。但是极度的害羞和沉默寡言的性格，使得他一直带着强烈的渴望等待着她，但是却永远永远不会主动走向她。","Feeling her look at him, he flung off his old straw hat, showing his round, close-cropped brown head, and reached out with a large brown-red hand for the great loaf, from which he broke a piece and started chewing with bulging cheek.He knew she was looking at him.And she had such power over him, the hot inarticulate animal, with such a hot, massive blood-stream down his great veins!He was hot through with countless suns, and mindless as noon.And shy with a violent, farouche shyness, that would wait for her with consuming wanting, but would never, never move towards her."
"和他在一起，就像是沐浴在另一种阳光中，沉重宽广而叫人大汗淋漓，之后便会忘记。从个人角度而言，他是不存在的。就仅仅像是一场温暖有力的生命之浴——然后便分离而忘记。接着，又重新开始这富有活力的沐浴，就像太阳一样。","With him, it would be like bathing in another kind of sunshine, heavy and big and perspiring: and afterwards one would forget.Personally, he would not exist.It would be just a bath of warm, powerful life—then separating and forgetting.Then again, the procreative bath, like sun."
"但那样不好！她非常厌倦个人接触，厌倦之后还要与男人交谈。和那么健康的生命在一起，之后人们只能心满意足地离开。她坐在那里，感到生命之流从他流向她，然后再从她流回到他那里。她从他的动作中得知，他对她的感受比她对他的感受更加强烈。这在他们两人的身体里面都是一种切肤之痛，他们坐在那里，心烦意乱，被各自目光尖锐的配偶、拥有者盯着。","But would that not be good!She was so tired of personal contacts, and having to talk with the man afterwards.With that healthy creature, one would just go satisfied away, afterwards.As she sat there, she felt the life streaming from him to her, and her to him.She knew by his movements he felt her even more than she felt him.It was almost a definite pain of consciousness in the body of each of them, and each sat as if distracted, watched by a keen-eyed spouse, possessor."
"朱丽叶想：为什么我不能走向他！为什么我不能生养他的孩子？这就像是给无意识的太阳、无意识的土地孕育孩子一样，孩子就像是果实。——她的子宫之花正怒放着。它不在乎什么感情和占有。它只要男人的雨露，完全不管未来如何。但她的内心充满了恐惧。她不敢！她不敢！要是这个男人可以找到一种方式就好了！但是他不会。他只会徘徊等待，徘徊在那无尽的欲望中，等着她跨越那道鸿沟。但她不敢，她不敢。他一直犹豫不决。","And Juliet thought: Why shouldn’t I go to him!Why shouldn’t I bear his child?It would be like bearing a child to the unconscious sun and the unconscious earth, a child like a fruit.—And the flower of her womb radiated.It did not care about sentiment or possession.It wanted man-dew only, utterly improvident.But her heart was clouded with fear.She dare not!She dare not!If only the man would find some way!But he would not.He would only hover and wait, hover in endless desire, waiting for her to cross the gully.And she dare not, she dare not.And he would hang round."
"“你晒太阳的时候，不怕被人看见吗？”她的丈夫转身说道，远远地看着那些农民。峡谷另一边那个忧郁的妻子也转身瞪着这栋别墅。就像是一场战争。","“You are not afraid of people seeing you when you take your sun-baths?” said her husband, turning round and looking across at the peasants.The saturnine wife over the gully, turned also to stare at the Villa.It was a kind of battle."
"“不！不会被看到。你也想晒晒日光浴吗？你想晒日光浴吗？”朱丽叶对他说。","“No!One needn’t be seen.Will you do it too?Will you take the sun-baths?” said Juliet to him."
"“喔——嗯——是的！我呆在这儿的时候，我想我应该晒晒。”","“Why—er—yes!I think I should like to, while I am here.”"
"他眼里闪烁着微弱的光，带着一种对欲望的绝望般的勇气，想去品尝这新鲜的果实，这个女人有着一对玫瑰色的乳房，在太阳下被晒得很成熟，在披肩里倾斜着。她想到他那苍白、缺乏阳光的城市人的小小之躯，行走在太阳下，绝望地行使着丈夫的权利。她的意识又一次模糊了。这个奇怪的、有着深深城市烙印的小个子家伙，一个好公民，在太阳的肉眼里就像是被刻上了罪犯烙印的人。他多么地讨厌暴露自己啊！","There was a gleam in his eyes, a desperate kind of courage of desire to taste this new fruit, this woman with rosy, sun-ripening breasts tilting within her wrap.And she thought of him with his blanched, etiolated little city figure, walking in the sun in the desperation of a husband’s rights.And her mind swooned again.The strange, branded little fellow, the good citizen, branded like a criminal in the naked eye of the sun.How he would hate exposing himself!"
"她的子宫之花变得晕眩，晕眩。她知道自己会接受他。她知道她会生养他的孩子。她知道是为了他，这个有着城市印迹的小小男人，她的子宫如莲花般盛开，就像有着黑色花蕊的紫色银莲花般盛开着。她知道她不会走向那个农民；她没有足够的勇气，她没有足够的自由。她也知道那个农民是不会走向她的，他有着土地般固执的消极，他会等，等待着，只会一次次地走进她的视线，在她的视野之内徘徊，带着那股动物般的坚韧的渴望。","And the flower of her womb went dizzy, dizzy.She knew she would take him.She knew she would bear his child.She knew it was for him, the branded little city man, that her womb was open radiating like a lotus, like the purple spread of a daisy anemone, dark at the core.She knew she would not go across to the peasant; she had not enough courage, she was not free enough.And she knew the peasant would never come for her, he had the dogged passivity of the earth, and would wait, wait, only putting himself in her sight, again and again, lingering across her vision, with the persistency of animal yearning."
"她看见农民那充血的燃烧的脸庞，感受得到他充满激情的眼中那热烈的蓝色火焰向她喷涌而出，蔓延至全身，他的阴茎因为她而激情奔涌——为了她。然而她永远不会走向他——她不敢，她不敢，有那么多的事情束缚着她。她那个子矮小的、苍白的、有着城市印记的丈夫会拥有她，他那小小的、紧张的阴茎会让她再为他生一个孩子。她无能为力。她被束缚在这巨大的、固定的世俗车轮上，而这宇宙间没有珀尔修斯来砍断这枷锁。","She had seen the flushed blood in the peasant’s burnt face, and felt the jetting, sudden blue heat pouring over her from his kindled eyes, and the rousing of his big penis against his body—for her, surging for her.Yet she would never come to him—she daren’t, she daren’t, so much was against her.And the little etiolated body of her husband, city-branded, would possess her, and his little, frantic penis would beget another child in her.She could not help it.She was bound to the vast, fixed wheel of circumstance, and there was no Perseus in the universe to cut the bonds."
